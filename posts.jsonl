This way you can chat with other fans.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6i5iC1crVEXF0nXS0EkSt.png?height=892&width=909)\n\n* Then you just have to select your artist in the dedicated #choose-your-artists channel. It will grant you with a new role and unlock the targeted channel.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LiFLeNjlEmSTMuq8OzH2M.png?height=905&width=1288)\n\n* Spread the word on Twitter! You can edit your tweet right away and send it on the network. We had a tremendous amount of tweets and retweets after this feature release.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pqkCIwPzI7ei6f9ccy4hN.png?height=883&width=1046)\n\n[https://twitter.com/rphl_21/status/1536778927997329421?s=20&t=bUXI_dwYyDYvFrLZ_q06XQ](https://twitter.com/rphl_21/status/1536778927997329421?s=20&t=bUXI_dwYyDYvFrLZ_q06XQ)\n\n[https://twitter.com/corentinch3/status/1541499905646239744?s=20&t=bcwaZvn2hMF08iYB8LGWqw](https://twitter.com/corentinch3/status/1541499905646239744?s=20&t=bcwaZvn2hMF08iYB8LGWqw)\n\n**II - Update of our ERC20 contract with multi-signature protected payment splitter** \n\nNow, that’s a lot of blockchain technical vocabulary!\n\n*Translation:* Artists could already set a payment splitter for their Fan Tokens to share the revenues with their manager, label, other artists… Now rules of the split are editable through on-chain multi-sig. Meaning that whenever an edition suggestion is made, the change has to be validated by all the current beneficiaries.\n\nThe smart contract managing this type of interactions is live.\n\n**III - A new Power Web App**\n\nYou might have seen this on the website lately? 👇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uMMsGiJsfcrfPjjPV_dg0.png?height=148&width=570)\n\nClick on the install button to get the Power Web App of Bolero installed on your phone/computer.\n\nIt will give you access, in one click from your Dock/Desktop/App list to an interface entirely dedicated to our website.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nHvryBkDP6La9vmeXNnQg.png?height=181&width=573)\n\n**IV - Level up the wallet connection with Rainbowkit**\n\nHave you seen this wallet connection popup lately?\n\nIt’s powered by a brand new and comprehensive library: Rainbowkit.\n\nAvailable on both mobile and desktop, it allows users to connect their wallet with all major web3 wallet providers:\n\n* Metamask\n* Rainbow\n* Torus\n* Wallet Connect (redirecting to almost all existing other providers)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TmzLapXcZaV9nWFEyguky.png?height=875&width=1217)\n\n**V - Discord field in user settings**\n\nTo ease the connection in between your Bolero account and your Discord profile, we now let you the possibility to paste your Discord profile ID in your settings.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nzQfrIR1NXkyYsnH8NXYb.png?height=905&width=1657)\n\nIt is especially useful to let you in Artists’ private channels when you get their tokens…\n\n**VI - Email notification system for NFT Compilations**\n\nYou might have witnessed the release of our NFT Compilations feature: for the first time, it enables music artists to collaborate on the same NFT project and release their assets all together in the same bundle.\n\nWe have wrapped up the feature by setting up an automated email notification system that alerts artists when:\n\n* They are invited to a new compilation\n* The compilation has been published\n\n**VII - Optimization of Artist and Backstage routes**\n\nOur backend code tends to gain weight over time and we make a constant effort to keep it light when it comes to interact with the frontend - your screen.\n\nThe way we did it lately was by “splitting the endpoints” of all the information that were sent by our servers to your browser when you call an Artist page or, for artists, their Backstage page.\n\nAny feedback? We hope that this changelog meets your expectations.\n\nYour input is very valuable to us.

She prepares me for my return; places single, white blossoms across the forehead of my Heart, above my crown. Protecting me and reminding me that I am eternally supported. That I am not only loved but that I **am** Love; that Love is all that I Am. She gently takes my hand and places it in my own. Where I am going, I must carry myself, she says. Where we are headed, the path is clear but still unknown. Its clarity lies in its clairvoyance; its whisper of eternity; its tender promise of eternity rooted in intimate trust; its vast picture of eternity planted inside of my mind, that I already knew what the pathway to infinity looks like, mapped out and ready for me to take my place as I settle in to a seat of surrender, a corner of curiosity, to turn on the tap and let the water flow effortlessly. To watch the hand of the Universe pull me in and install me with knowledge past, ancient wisdom and free me of fleeting temperance. To show me a new door, to a Now which looks nothing like the one I see before me, yet which feels strangely familiar in its welcoming acceptance. For me, as I am. For all that is, as it is. Here, I not only wait, but I choose. I choose my guidance as another me chooses the door in-front, behind, in the far left corner. I choose my experience and it enlightens my view. Shows me possibility and I lean farther into capability. When my inner child comes to play with me, I will tell her that she is safe. I will assure her inconsolable heart that she is deserving of receiving all that she gives. When she steps cautiously into my dreams, I will invite her lovingly to make her own choices. I will tell her that I could see her trepidation. For I, too, was peeking from behind the curtain to watch her imagination bloom. And, as in her wonder-filled eyes, I could see it in my own. I could feel the sparkle that I saw light up her path; could smell the petals she laid before her as stepping-stones into her truth, closer to me. Could sense the anguish which she asked with lightness, a playfulness unique to who she is, yet one that hides a plethora of angst. But she is the one who can turn fear into curiosity; is the one who can give love when she feels closed in. She is the silhouette who can come out of her own shadow when she creates from her Spark, when she steps in to her own, shapeshifting mould, when she hugs her bears tightly because it brings her closer with herself. \n\nI love her, so deeply.  \n I see her now, within me. \n Come forth, sweet one.

{"id": "k71Q69BfpeJXKTHY0RQtHawygjpjcbnJHswOjbyLcFs", "title": "NFT亏了，但我可以授权做IP啊", "body": "最近几条关于NFT IP授权的新闻扎堆出现，让很多人终于开始关注这一赛道。在这几天，有的无聊猿被挂到“人才市场”，有的无聊猿则穿上了新的系列套装。这些让人眼前一亮的新尝试在如今的Crypto寒冬中格外难能可贵，似乎也在昭示着，熊市中，人们逐渐从对于NFT赛道中各类Infura（基建）项目近乎迷信的关注，转变成了对于NFT品牌价值的发掘。\n\n诚然，Infura是底层基础，似乎是所有项目的“必经之路”，但说到底Infura比的是市占率，而关于市占率，在无比崇尚正统性的Crypto世界中，若非出现重大漏洞，先发优势似乎是无解的，不然OpenSea的日子也不会如此悠哉。\n\nCrypto的进步依赖于技术的发展，而Web3走向主流需要的是不断破圈。\n\n# NFT：从艺术到品牌\n\n让我们先回过头看看人们对NFT的认知是如何发展成“品牌”的。\n\n让我们先从公认的最早的“NFT”项目——CryptoPunks说起（虽然现在也有很多项目被发现比CryptoPunks更早诞生）。\n\n尽管现在余文乐把CryptoPunk当作Logo因在自己的衣服上，Tiffany也做了CryptoPunk形象的首饰，但在最初，Larva Labs把它定位成了一个向密码朋克致敬的艺术项目，两个开发者也多了“艺术家”这一身份。\n\n再之后虽然也有不少游戏类的DApp使用NFT技术承载游戏内资产，如虚拟宠物、游戏道具、交易卡等，而让NFT第一次大规模出圈的是Beeple的NFT艺术品在佳士得拍出了6900万美金的天价。在Hackatao、XCOPY、Coldie、Alotta Money等NFT艺术家多年的推动下，NFT在艺术领域迎来了爆发。而在那时，人们对于NFT的关注和人们对于所有新事物的关注一样停留在了底层技术层面，人们关注区块链技术如何帮助数字艺术确权，关注数字艺术在哪里才能真正永存，关注区块链技术如何让艺术变得“可编程”、“可互动”。\n\n随着时间推移，人们理解中的NFT从艺术品变成了“社交资本”，拜大规模出现的头像NFT所赐。这一趋势其实从HashMasks就能窥探一二，不过可惜的是HashMasks过于追求艺术性，却忽视了作为社交资本时更为重要的区分度与传播性。\n\n而在那时，人们似乎还没有“品牌”的概念，回过头看关于BAYC早期的文章，大多数在聊的也是持有一只无聊猿就能够加入“Yacht Club”，成为这个社交圈的一员，不仅推特上会有一堆无聊猿关注你，甚至像库里、Snoop Dogg、周杰伦都是这个圈子里的。似乎只要你持有一只无聊猿就能与他们产生联系，而这些名人、大佬的选择也像是给BAYC印上了认证戳。\n\n到如今，仍然有数不清的项目以“艺术”或“社交圈”为核心发行着NFT系列。艺术项目的核心是艺术家，而往往艺术家不会做运营；社交圈项目的冷启动往往依赖于某个名人的站台，让大家以为持有这个NFT就能认识到这些名人，但如何让这些名人长期在社区活跃是一个难以解决的问题。\n\n而让我们再来看看如今发展得还不错的项目，比如BAYC、Azuki、Doodles、RTFKT，我们会发现，在他们的崛起阶段都在做品牌。\n\n“做品牌”这个事情听起来挺虚的，让我们换个词：建设社区。建设社区是通过组织各种活动让社区成员对于项目产生更深刻的认知。而“品牌”在百度百科中的解释就是：消费者对某类产品及产品系列的认知程度。\n\n在Web2，品牌诞生自公司内部的决策，然后再按图索骥搜寻用户。而在Web3，品牌诞生自社区，项目方可以预设一个大方向，但关于项目共识、认知的细节则是在社区形成的过程中动态调整的，这样形成的品牌才是自下而上的，才是Web3品牌，而不是一个套着壳子的Web2品牌。\n\n从最开始对艺术的极致追求，到中期的对艺术性的放弃，再到现在人们认识到PFP形象对于品牌形成冷启动阶段的重要作用，NFT也完成了从艺术品到艺术消费品的蜕变。\n\n# Web3的品牌是宗教\n\n关于无聊猿的Otherside，在最近的评价越来越趋于一致，越来越多人认为BAYC往游戏赛道发展并不是一个最佳选择，面前明明摆着一条能够更出圈、获得更大影响力的道路，Yuga Labs却选择回到Gamefi这个相对狭小且凶险的圈子。\n\n不过话虽如此，但以无聊猿如今的体量来说，也许可以做到同时走好几条路，和Animoca做游戏，和滚石发展品牌，并不冲突。但是，对于更多项目而言，只能选其中的一条路走。\n\n艺术太小众，Gamefi太凶险，社交太务虚……\n\n不如好好做品牌。\n\n上文提到，在Web3，做品牌就是建设社区，认知与共识凝结起来后再做产品。相比于Web2通过一件件产品来博取用户的信任，对于Web3项目来说，“人”才是最宝贵的财富。面对Web3世界，庞大且坚实的社区是项目安身立命之本，能够更容易地抓住人们的注意力，并创造出更大的声浪；而面对Web2世界，这也是最能吸引传统品牌的原因。\n\n一个NFT项目的持有者人数有几千人，社区有上万人，把这个数量按照Web2世界中传统品牌的转化率计算，能量与一个数百万甚至上千万关注者的品牌相当，更重要的是这群人还不是四散在各处，他们彼此之间还有极强的链接，这已经不仅仅是品牌与粉丝的关系了。\n\n这是宗教。\n\n当你拥有了这样一群坚定且能动的支持者，建立在这个共识之上去做任何产品都是合理的，而且很多情况下根本不需要你自己去做，会有知名服装品牌主动联名，会有游戏开发商主动将品牌接入游戏中，会有音乐人主动创作歌曲，会有影视公司主动创作影视作品。品牌的影响力会迎来指数级的爆发增长，而影响力的持续扩大又会带来更强大的效应与共识。\n\n# NFT IP授权\n\nWeb3品牌欢迎社区成员主动传播，所以很多项目采用CC0协议或者是将NFT的版权授予持有者，如此一来，持有者以及品牌的支持者便有权利去做任何衍生品，比如上文提到的服装、游戏、歌曲、影视。\n\n不过，长时间观察下来，用IP做周边、授权的似乎也只有极少数人。这其实很正常，对于大多数Holder而言，很难凭借自己的力量对接到Web2品牌方、供应链、影视公司等等，而且即便是能对接到，繁杂的法律文件等也不是谁都能处理得过来的。也正是把握住了这一痛点，现在逐渐开始有做NFT IP授权的项目走上了舞台。做IP授权不仅仅能让项目本身获得更高的知名度，也能让持有者、项目方获得更多的收入，继续投身到品牌建设之中。\n\n不过这条路并不好走。\n\n最基础的是法律问题。Web3的版权、所有权问题很好解决，看链上数据就可以了，但是一旦涉及到与Web2结合，事情就会变得无比复杂。很多Web3项目没有注册版权，很多Crypto Native的团队甚至不屑于注册版权，但很多Web2公司在签署IP授权协议时必须要求提交版权证明文件。\n\n而即使是注册了版权文件，“Holder拥有所持有的NFT的版权”这件事要如何实现呢？每一笔交易流转都签署一份版权转让协议显然是无法实现的，版权证明文件要么没有，要么被项目方拿在手里。而你也不能要求Web2的大公司去“相信”项目方不会“作恶”，信任成本和法律程序会阻碍落地过程。\n\n站在Holder角度考虑，未来可能会面对众多NFT IP授权平台，我们应该如何挑选呢？举例来说，Boredjobs的确拿到了一些无聊猿的授权，不过这也只是整个流程其中最好实现的步骤。作为Web3圈内人，认识各种NFT的Holder是很简单的事情，从他们手中要到授权也是很简单的，毕竟只需要签一份协议就有机会让“我的猴子替我赚钱”。\n\n真正的难点是上面提到的大部分Holder做不到的事情，拿到12个无聊猿的授权很容易，联系到泡泡玛特并让泡泡玛特用这12只无聊猿的形象生产销售一套盲盒很难。\n\nNFT IP授权开始被人重视，这也许就意味着NFT2.0时代的到来。很多人会认为NFT2.0指的是未来在技术方向进行更深度的拓展，而NFT横向发展、不断拓宽影响力的边界也一定会是大势所趋。技术的进步会让整个领域的下限不断提高，而在这个技术微创新不断、缺少大创新的领域，品牌才是将天花板不断抬高的最佳方式。", "timestamp": 1657014605, "digest": "h_rxfORrmqXfBLmpWpoIZfBv_aRTALWFOcoqZiMaRm0", "contributor": "0x429f13e4ec5E57c9AE2388c5020E372F73fe168A"}

21年Coinbase的已核实注册用户为5600万人，币安21年注册用户数可查的数据是2800万以上，曾经火币的18-19年巅峰期用户是在1500万注册 由此可见，区块链日活目前还是集中在中心化交易所，链上行为的日活还在增长阶段，虽然有很多的钱包地址，但交互的数量还是较少的 ​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ao_aSqRB4qhgd9XW8MxJw.png?height=555&width=1440)\n\n\nNFT的日活目前则是在10万人左右，总人口不超过300万人\n在这些数字背后的故事，就是区块链目前是一个满是金子的无人深空\n总人口和日活不如某国内部分约炮app，但估值一度与世界前十的资产持平\n\n## \n黑暗森林与金字塔\n\n\n在链上的数据可查可看、开发开源的情况下，无人深空也成为了黑暗森林\n作为一个在二级市场暴富然后归零的韭菜，体会到的一个重点就是，区块链的阶级是层层传导的金字塔\n\n\n和传统世界的抽税阶级和纳税阶级不同，其更想要去维稳整体的架构，人们被迫被均值回归成为普通人\n印钞就是控制的手段之一\n\n区块链的阶级更像是被加速的养老金结构，在这个过程中，生态位更高的人，成本更低的人，会收割韭菜\n但也会在博弈之中，催生更多、更快、更迅猛的阶级变化和碰撞\n大家的主要猎物一方面是多印的钞票，一方面是其他人的钱包\n财富的阶级还没有在这里被完全固化与限定\n但这个前提在于，要有足够的钱，和\n足够多的新人\n\n## \n无人深空的流量增长\n\n\nWeb 3依旧是流量生意\n最近很多web2的创业者开始闯入web3的浪潮，但是大部分在一级市场融资就陷入困境，之后项目也是越做越凉，最后割的就是投资方\n\n其最主要的原因就是web2的传统产品思维困住了这些人\n其实，web3需要的是张麻子，敢带着4个人，拉来一座城的人，去抢钱\n​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rSfZd1eIf74rjcEZQmM7l.png?height=796&width=1194)\n\n\n在web3创业初始，如果推特和discord能有几万个活跃的用户，其实会有很多资方和资源主动找到项目，这个是因为真实的流量，会比埋头做一个产品、讲一个叙事要更有说服力\n\n\n这是金字塔结构自上而下传导下来的，交易所需要源源不断的新增用户和项目，项目其中一个重要的任务，就是吸引用户加入加密世界\n而现阶段web3的用户与web2用户的一个重要区别在于，大家是天然的投资者，主要的需求不是吃喝住行，而是赚钱，吃喝住行已经有了非常成熟的解决方案，但赚钱不行\n\n所以如果项目在流量这个事情上折戟成沙\n\n则大概率也说明了其产品、故事、团队、模型的不成功 \n\nweb3的用户是主动去找项目的，因为谁赢了，他们才会帮谁 \n\n好项目不缺资源，但有些项目怎么样都缺少资源，这才是真正的原因 \n\n## 如何做一个张麻子 \n\n在分析如何做好一个项目上，大部分的文章剖析都偏向于复盘向，即一个项目火了之后，大家再去剖析其为什么火 \n\n我更偏向于从投资人、web3的用户（韭菜）角度去分析这个事情，就引申出了几个有意思的流量玩法的分析 \n\n记住我们之前的web3用户解读： 1. 大家都是投资人 2. 大家来赚钱的 \n\n那么对于张麻子而言 \n\n第一，要师出有名，要有足够的背书，让我相信他们有钱、有人脉 \n\n第二，团队要能搞钱，或者让我信他们能搞钱 \n\n第三，武器要好，产品要让我觉得有投资的安全感 \n\n第四，要自己敢打敢拼，要先赢了，我才会跟着 \n\n第五，滚雪球，先得有一批信徒，才有一群人，我才敢上 ...... \n\n## 邀请码的故事：枪在手，跟我走 \n\n对于web2用户而言，邀请码是反常识的，是被人玩烂了，用烂了的方式 但对于一个能赚钱的项目而言，邀请码就是让小众用户社区，破圈到大众用户的一个重要方式 因为你的传递速率是2的次方级，大家传递的原因很简单\n\n我需要拉人进来接盘、想让朋友一起赚钱\n\n外面的朋友也想进来赚钱\n\n我需要有一个理由推荐项目 每个韭菜都需要一个引路人和体面\n\n## 白名单与空投的故事：枪弹在你手，9成财富在碉楼\n\n白名单和空投只是获取用户的手段，大部分的项目都会暗示空投、发白名单的方式去许诺后期利益，9成的财富在未来等着\n\n去鼓励用户的交互与热度 \n\n这样投资方能看得到数据，交易所能看得到未来的持币地址 \n\n才会有投资、才会有币发 \n\n但发枪弹之后，随之而来的问题则在于 \n\n一、我拿了枪弹，我会不会被打死？ \n\n二、我拿了枪弹，为什么要跟着他们一起冲？ \n\n张麻子的方式是，杀了黄四郎的替身，假装赢了，引爆了所有人的情绪，大家就一起上了 \n\n也就是，要让所有人觉得，赢了，fomo了，死而无憾了 \n\n上币安也好，A16Z也罢 \n\n需要无数的利好与真正的杀手锏 \n\n## 代币模型：浦东就是上海 \n\n在代币模型上，到底激励了谁 \n\n项目的利益决定了队伍的走向 \n\n在部分gamefi产品的设计上，由于让利给了公会、团队、投资人，反而伤害了很多新玩家的利益，导致死亡螺旋 \n\n在部分应用层产品设计上，存在明确的抽税阶级，凌驾于其他人的利益，导致难以长期未计 \n\n谁是支持者，在什么阶段，谁获得了利益，这是模型要考虑的，模型设定死的 \n\n例如一个早期项目，如果没有理解谁是需要在这个阶段讨好的、激励的对象，那么大概率就是折戟成沙 \n\n在每一个阶段给正确的群体激励，才能实现自己的阶级利益 \n\n比如说 一个无法融资的gamefi产品，需要激励的大概率就是投资方，代币设计要给投资方足够低的筹码，足够吸引人的价格 \n\n一个自带流量的gamefi产品，需要激励的就是新玩家，那么设计上则需要nft控价，代币发放速率非常陡峭且缓慢 \n\n一个没有流量，满手融资的产品，则需要激励的就是用户，那么设计上就应该大规模空投、做市场、置换宣发资源、吸血鬼攻击 \n\n最终，都是服务自己所处的阶级的利益，这是建立一个村庄，不是提供服务换取回报 \n\n## 最后的讨论：流量与产品之争 \n\n在传统游戏上，最近有一个激烈的探讨 \n\n在现在的行情下，是发行重要，还是产品重要？ \n\n有的人说都重要，有人说产品牛逼吊打一切，有人说没发行，产品不会有玩家，好死 \n\n其实大家都对 只是要看每个人具体有什么样的牌和条件 \n\n不是所有人都有着你所拥有的优厚条件\n\n引导到区块链领域，这个问题更像是如何把自己的木桶补齐 \n\n确实存在流量、团队、产品、投资方、生态等等都看似完美的无缺木桶 \n\n但绝大部分都有短板 如何在已知自己的短板上，平衡发行 vs 产品这样的问题？ \n\n没有标准答案，也许这就是为什么创业项目其实是九死一生的原因吧\n\n过往文字：\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/FwwApwwA3Z3_zfoBZ858EjWLKQhpysA1-IkDfBBY3X8](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/FwwApwwA3Z3_zfoBZ858EjWLKQhpysA1-IkDfBBY3X8)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/eqZDIExIlh5SWLY_AyVmZ2ji2O98itG_73DbumXpky0](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/eqZDIExIlh5SWLY_AyVmZ2ji2O98itG_73DbumXpky0)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/3mYy6PSYhIcxwgSmK8bhrdeLZz7GA4Ne5GnnsKf8Fos](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/3mYy6PSYhIcxwgSmK8bhrdeLZz7GA4Ne5GnnsKf8Fos)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/Q9OwuxJDjpDULcR4vC9EKn8BP-Zq5YvSs7fHM7rDLlA](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/Q9OwuxJDjpDULcR4vC9EKn8BP-Zq5YvSs7fHM7rDLlA)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/BUB-x4wQX1GTKx_bmb_WMagIdM7l3R7jEUrhrCczf4E](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/BUB-x4wQX1GTKx_bmb_WMagIdM7l3R7jEUrhrCczf4E)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/0wmMy0NQfH3btKsYRLeUgjtQvbhGHyRpukn0zuJ743U](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/0wmMy0NQfH3btKsYRLeUgjtQvbhGHyRpukn0zuJ743U)\n\n也可以来看看我的推特：

存在不太一样的创业道路\n\n\n张麻子是让子弹飞里的一个故事主人公，他带着自己的队伍，进入了黄四郎管理的城市，人很少，但推翻了黄四郎的治理，让旧有的沉重赋税和架构都被打破\n\n\n在传统领域，大多数项目是靠自己的产品，通过营销让用户知道了自己的产品，同时满足了法币用户的某种需求，获得了持续的收入\n\n\n这种商业模式在区块链领域依旧是存在的\n\n\n但张麻子的行为，则更像加密世界一些激进创业者与他们做项目的新方式\n在讨论之前，先来看一下大概加密世界的用户分布，理解一下加密的无人深空\n\n\nETH日活目前为38万地址左右，日均交易与去年交易量持平，注册地址近2亿个（不去重）\n​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m9fV9JQ0oKta9VlA4XhDs.png?height=612&width=1440)\n\n  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XO4XNcmCbFPnUJl2mo8k_.png?height=604&width=1440)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n7-Ik4ZGv7cwDXbHZiezu.png?height=712&width=1684)\n\nCoinbase的22年Q1，月均交易用户数920万，同比增长50.82%，环比下降19.3% 21年Coinbase的已核实注册用户为5600万人，币安21年注册用户数可查的数据是2800万以上，曾经火币的18-19年巅峰期用户是在1500万注册 由此可见，区块链日活目前还是集中在中心化交易所，链上行为的日活还在增长阶段，虽然有很多的钱包地址，但交互的数量还是较少的 ​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ao_aSqRB4qhgd9XW8MxJw.png?height=555&width=1440)\n\n\nNFT的日活目前则是在10万人左右，总人口不超过300万人\n在这些数字背后的故事，就是区块链目前是一个满是金子的无人深空\n总人口和日活不如某国内部分约炮app，但估值一度与世界前十的资产持平\n\n## \n黑暗森林与金字塔\n\n\n在链上的数据可查可看、开发开源的情况下，无人深空也成为了黑暗森林\n作为一个在二级市场暴富然后归零的韭菜，体会到的一个重点就是，区块链的阶级是层层传导的金字塔\n\n\n和传统世界的抽税阶级和纳税阶级不同，其更想要去维稳整体的架构，人们被迫被均值回归成为普通人\n印钞就是控制的手段之一\n\n区块链的阶级更像是被加速的养老金结构，在这个过程中，生态位更高的人，成本更低的人，会收割韭菜\n但也会在博弈之中，催生更多、更快、更迅猛的阶级变化和碰撞\n大家的主要猎物一方面是多印的钞票，一方面是其他人的钱包\n财富的阶级还没有在这里被完全固化与限定\n但这个前提在于，要有足够的钱，和\n足够多的新人\n\n## \n无人深空的流量增长\n\n\nWeb 3依旧是流量生意\n最近很多web2的创业者开始闯入web3的浪潮，但是大部分在一级市场融资就陷入困境，之后项目也是越做越凉，最后割的就是投资方\n\n其最主要的原因就是web2的传统产品思维困住了这些人\n其实，web3需要的是张麻子，敢带着4个人，拉来一座城的人，去抢钱\n​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rSfZd1eIf74rjcEZQmM7l.png?height=796&width=1194)\n\n\n在web3创业初始，如果推特和discord能有几万个活跃的用户，其实会有很多资方和资源主动找到项目，这个是因为真实的流量，会比埋头做一个产品、讲一个叙事要更有说服力\n\n\n这是金字塔结构自上而下传导下来的，交易所需要源源不断的新增用户和项目，项目其中一个重要的任务，就是吸引用户加入加密世界\n而现阶段web3的用户与web2用户的一个重要区别在于，大家是天然的投资者，主要的需求不是吃喝住行，而是赚钱，吃喝住行已经有了非常成熟的解决方案，但赚钱不行\n\n所以如果项目在流量这个事情上折戟成沙\n\n则大概率也说明了其产品、故事、团队、模型的不成功 \n\nweb3的用户是主动去找项目的，因为谁赢了，他们才会帮谁 \n\n好项目不缺资源，但有些项目怎么样都缺少资源，这才是真正的原因 \n\n## 如何做一个张麻子 \n\n在分析如何做好一个项目上，大部分的文章剖析都偏向于复盘向，即一个项目火了之后，大家再去剖析其为什么火 \n\n我更偏向于从投资人、web3的用户（韭菜）角度去分析这个事情，就引申出了几个有意思的流量玩法的分析 \n\n记住我们之前的web3用户解读： 1. 大家都是投资人 2. 大家来赚钱的 \n\n那么对于张麻子而言 \n\n第一，要师出有名，要有足够的背书，让我相信他们有钱、有人脉 \n\n第二，团队要能搞钱，或者让我信他们能搞钱 \n\n第三，武器要好，产品要让我觉得有投资的安全感 \n\n第四，要自己敢打敢拼，要先赢了，我才会跟着 \n\n第五，滚雪球，先得有一批信徒，才有一群人，我才敢上 ...... \n\n## 邀请码的故事：枪在手，跟我走 \n\n对于web2用户而言，邀请码是反常识的，是被人玩烂了，用烂了的方式 但对于一个能赚钱的项目而言，邀请码就是让小众用户社区，破圈到大众用户的一个重要方式 因为你的传递速率是2的次方级，大家传递的原因很简单\n\n我需要拉人进来接盘、想让朋友一起赚钱\n\n外面的朋友也想进来赚钱\n\n我需要有一个理由推荐项目 每个韭菜都需要一个引路人和体面\n\n## 白名单与空投的故事：枪弹在你手，9成财富在碉楼\n\n白名单和空投只是获取用户的手段，大部分的项目都会暗示空投、发白名单的方式去许诺后期利益，9成的财富在未来等着\n\n去鼓励用户的交互与热度 \n\n这样投资方能看得到数据，交易所能看得到未来的持币地址 \n\n才会有投资、才会有币发 \n\n但发枪弹之后，随之而来的问题则在于 \n\n一、我拿了枪弹，我会不会被打死？ \n\n二、我拿了枪弹，为什么要跟着他们一起冲？ \n\n张麻子的方式是，杀了黄四郎的替身，假装赢了，引爆了所有人的情绪，大家就一起上了 \n\n也就是，要让所有人觉得，赢了，fomo了，死而无憾了 \n\n上币安也好，A16Z也罢 \n\n需要无数的利好与真正的杀手锏 \n\n## 代币模型：浦东就是上海 \n\n在代币模型上，到底激励了谁 \n\n项目的利益决定了队伍的走向 \n\n在部分gamefi产品的设计上，由于让利给了公会、团队、投资人，反而伤害了很多新玩家的利益，导致死亡螺旋 \n\n在部分应用层产品设计上，存在明确的抽税阶级，凌驾于其他人的利益，导致难以长期未计 \n\n谁是支持者，在什么阶段，谁获得了利益，这是模型要考虑的，模型设定死的 \n\n例如一个早期项目，如果没有理解谁是需要在这个阶段讨好的、激励的对象，那么大概率就是折戟成沙 \n\n在每一个阶段给正确的群体激励，才能实现自己的阶级利益 \n\n比如说 一个无法融资的gamefi产品，需要激励的大概率就是投资方，代币设计要给投资方足够低的筹码，足够吸引人的价格 \n\n一个自带流量的gamefi产品，需要激励的就是新玩家，那么设计上则需要nft控价，代币发放速率非常陡峭且缓慢 \n\n一个没有流量，满手融资的产品，则需要激励的就是用户，那么设计上就应该大规模空投、做市场、置换宣发资源、吸血鬼攻击 \n\n最终，都是服务自己所处的阶级的利益，这是建立一个村庄，不是提供服务换取回报 \n\n## 最后的讨论：流量与产品之争 \n\n在传统游戏上，最近有一个激烈的探讨 \n\n在现在的行情下，是发行重要，还是产品重要？ \n\n有的人说都重要，有人说产品牛逼吊打一切，有人说没发行，产品不会有玩家，好死 \n\n其实大家都对 只是要看每个人具体有什么样的牌和条件 \n\n不是所有人都有着你所拥有的优厚条件\n\n引导到区块链领域，这个问题更像是如何把自己的木桶补齐 \n\n确实存在流量、团队、产品、投资方、生态等等都看似完美的无缺木桶 \n\n但绝大部分都有短板 如何在已知自己的短板上，平衡发行 vs 产品这样的问题？ \n\n没有标准答案，也许这就是为什么创业项目其实是九死一生的原因吧\n\n过往文字：\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/FwwApwwA3Z3_zfoBZ858EjWLKQhpysA1-IkDfBBY3X8](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/FwwApwwA3Z3_zfoBZ858EjWLKQhpysA1-IkDfBBY3X8)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/eqZDIExIlh5SWLY_AyVmZ2ji2O98itG_73DbumXpky0](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/eqZDIExIlh5SWLY_AyVmZ2ji2O98itG_73DbumXpky0)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/3mYy6PSYhIcxwgSmK8bhrdeLZz7GA4Ne5GnnsKf8Fos](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/3mYy6PSYhIcxwgSmK8bhrdeLZz7GA4Ne5GnnsKf8Fos)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/Q9OwuxJDjpDULcR4vC9EKn8BP-Zq5YvSs7fHM7rDLlA](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/Q9OwuxJDjpDULcR4vC9EKn8BP-Zq5YvSs7fHM7rDLlA)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/BUB-x4wQX1GTKx_bmb_WMagIdM7l3R7jEUrhrCczf4E](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/BUB-x4wQX1GTKx_bmb_WMagIdM7l3R7jEUrhrCczf4E)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/0wmMy0NQfH3btKsYRLeUgjtQvbhGHyRpukn0zuJ743U](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/0wmMy0NQfH3btKsYRLeUgjtQvbhGHyRpukn0zuJ743U)\n\n也可以来看看我的推特：

Polium [says](https://medium.com/@Polium_/polium-one-the-worlds-first-multi-chain-gaming-console-5052a44594c8) its community will help them build the console’s hardware and software and states it will have a functional prototype in “a few months.”\n\nAccording to Polium, the console will feature its own [multichain cryptocurrency wallet](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happens-if-you-lose-or-break-your-hardware-crypto-wallet), and the controller will have a wallet button for users to make trades more efficiently. Security and verification of transactions from the console will be enabled via a fingerprint scanner on the controller.\n\nThe console's price is unknown, but Polium does plan to mint a “Polium Pass” NFT, which will allow holders to claim a console on the initial launch day. Pass holders will receive another NFT, which in the future can be staked for a “PLAY” token, the console's native token for transacting on its marketplace app.\n\nPolium plans on releasing 10,000 consoles to Polium Pass holders and partners on the Q3 2024 initial launch, with more units manufactured for the public in Q3 2025. It has set a goal of selling over 1 million units.\n\nThe company has already received criticism for its logo looking similar to another popular console, the Nintendo GameCube. Polium said it didn’t copy the logo and is [already](https://twitter.com/Polium__/status/1543962020151758848) creating a new logo “that is original.”\n\n### Chinese tech giants to check ID before NFT purchases\n\nChina’s NFT industry players and the country’s largest technology firms have signed an agreement to check the identity of users using digital collectible trading platforms, according to a [report](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3184021/china-nfts-tencent-and-ant-group-join-industry-pledge-ban) on July 4 from the South China Morning Post.\n\nA so-called “self-discipline initiative” document was signed by companies with a stake in China’s NFT market, such as JD.com, Tencent Holdings, Baidu, and digital payments platform Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba Group.\n\nThe document was [published](http://www.chncia.org/xiehuidongtai-detail.php?mid=19&id=7041) on June 30 by the China Cultural Industry Association and, while not legally binding, calls on the firms to “require real-name authentication of those who issue, sell and buy” NFTs, and “only support legal tender as the denomination and settlement currency.”\n\nThe initiative also seeks for the companies to promise not to create secondary marketplaces for NFTs to [combat trading speculation](https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-state-media-signals-tighter-crypto-regulations-in-terra-aftermath).\n\nThe popularity of NFTs in China is on the rise, and digital collectable platforms [have grown 5X in just four months](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-platforms-in-china-grow-5x-in-four-months-despite-government-warnings) from February to mid-June 2022 despite multiple warnings from the government.\n\n### Nike looking to create video game NFTs\n\nA [patent](https://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=nike&OS=nike&RS=nike) filed by Nike Inc. on June 30 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) shows the fitness clothier is interested in a “video game integration” of NFTs.\n\nAs per the filing, Nike seeks to patent a method where a “virtual object” will display in games, where that object is a “virtual shoe, article of apparel, headgear, avatar, or pet.” Other language in the filing suggests Nike plans to sell the physical shoes and clothes represented within the NFTs.\n\n***Related: [NFT hype evidently dead as daily sales in June 2022 dip to one-year lows](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-hype-evidently-dead-as-daily-sales-in-june-2022-dip-to-one-year-lows)***\n\nThe reasoning presented in the filing suggests Nike is concerned with counterfeit digital collectibles and says there “exists a need for a retailer to more directly influence and control the nature and ultimate supply of digital objects within this virtual market.”\n\nIt also reasons an opportunity exists for it to capitalize and engage with video game players as most games feature customizable characters, which could make them “more engaged with a brand in the physical world.”\n\n### More Nifty News:\n\nThe second-largest sale of an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain not only in U.S. dollars but also in Ethereum happened on July 3 when the domain “000.eth” [sold](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x57f1887a8bf19b14fc0df6fd9b2acc9af147ea85/24293655359084398983762148957951887367734741115283469135310733710692111186993) for 300 ETH, roughly $320,000. The highest sale of an ENS domain was for “paradigm.eth” in October 2021, which [fetched](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x57f1887a8bf19b14fc0df6fd9b2acc9af147ea85/25678324544658514891171433701500781853442152332474238876092807294041322428124) 420 ETH, around $1.5 million at the time.\n\nSocial media platform [Facebook will add support for NFTs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nfts-to-appear-on-facebook-cross-post-with-instagram-as-meta-web3-expansion-continues), and a “digital collectibles” tab will appear on the pages of selected creators in the U.S., with a feature to cross-post between Instagram and Facebook rolling out eventually.", "timestamp": 1657011524, "digest": "A4pvEQqmThQjCbJfoTsjNidcZ7ZqzKqhfvSckFpL0GE", "contributor": "0x9B3492b79E45b21156eE02Daec63af6d1B7368b4"}

She prepares me for my return; places single, white blossoms across the forehead of my Heart, above my crown. Protecting me and reminding me that I am eternally supported. That I am not only loved but that I **am** Love; that Love is all that I Am. She gently takes my hand and places it in my own. Where I am going, I must carry myself, she says. Where we are headed, the path is clear but still unknown. Its clarity lies in its clairvoyance; its whisper of eternity; its tender promise of eternity rooted in intimate trust; its vast picture of eternity planted inside of my mind, that I already knew what the pathway to infinity looks like, mapped out and ready for me to take my place as I settle in to a seat of surrender, a corner of curiosity, to turn on the tap and let the water flow effortlessly. To watch the hand of the Universe pull me in and install me with knowledge past, ancient wisdom and free me of fleeting temperance. To show me a new door, to a Now which looks nothing like the one I see before me, yet which feels strangely familiar in its welcoming acceptance. For me, as I am. For all that is, as it is. Here, I not only wait, but I choose. I choose my guidance as another me chooses the door in-front, behind, in the far left corner. I choose my experience and it enlightens my view. Shows me possibility and I lean farther into capability. When my inner child comes to play with me, I will tell her that she is safe. I will assure her inconsolable heart that she is deserving of receiving all that she gives. When she steps cautiously into my dreams, I will invite her lovingly to make her own choices. I will tell her that I could see her trepidation. For I, too, was peeking from behind the curtain to watch her imagination bloom. And, as in her wonder-filled eyes, I could see it in my own. I could feel the sparkle that I saw light up her path; could smell the petals she laid before her as stepping-stones into her truth, closer to me. Could sense the anguish which she asked with lightness, a playfulness unique to who she is, yet one that hides a plethora of angst. But she is the one who can turn fear into curiosity; is the one who can give love when she feels closed in. She is the silhouette who can come out of her own shadow when she creates from her Spark, when she steps in to her own, shapeshifting mould, when she hugs her bears tightly because it brings her closer with herself. \n\nI love her, so deeply.  \n I see her now, within me. \n Come forth, sweet one. I promise to always hold your hand while you show me the way.", "timestamp": 1656255253, "digest": "EYm5TzPffhresMK5LJHkuEfGtJRqGGp86zMsXS-qHUM", "contributor": "0x3E2D1E306bC9f3FAE0b75314FbABdB8DBC507774"}

{"id": "n1YVdicnwlBvjjbaD508Yo-kNhuvMdYtqi58QdgLLqE", "title": "Learn Python Programming", "body": "Python is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is used in web development, data science, creating software prototypes, and so on. Fortunately for beginners, Python has simple easy-to-use syntax. This makes Python an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o5JCmg7JYZq0YaC33qXg0.png?height=420&width=1000)\n\nPython is a cross-platform programming language, which means that it can run on multiple platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, and has even been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines. It is free and open-source.\n\nEven though most of today's Linux and Mac have Python pre-installed in it, the version might be out-of-date. So, it is always a good idea to install the most current version. \n  \n The Easiest Way to Run Python\n\nThe easiest way to run Python is by using **Thonny IDE**.\n\nThe Thonny IDE comes with the latest version of Python bundled in it. So you don't have to install Python separately.\n\nFollow the following steps to run Python on your computer.\n\n1. Download [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/).\n2. Run the installer to install **Thonny** on your computer.\n3. Go to: **File** > **New**. Then save the file with `.py` extension. For example, `hello.py`, `example.py`, etc. \n You can give any name to the file. However, the file name should end with **.py**\n4. Write Python code in the file and save it. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2ir2MtjuRVSaCs9UY4T7L.png?height=483&width=805)\n\n* Then Go to **Run** > **Run current script** or simply click **F5** to run it. \n  \n **Install Python Separately**\n\n  If you don't want to use Thonny, here's how you can install and run Python on your computer.\n  1. Download the [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n  2. Run the installer file and follow the steps to install Python \n During the install process, check **Add Python to environment variables**. This will add Python to environment variables, and you can run Python from any part of the computer. \n  \n Also, you can choose the path where Python is installed. \n  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JRcQ0ZaHumsDM8aRPsZLC.png?height=340&width=550)\n\nOnce you finish the installation process, you can run Python.\n\n## 1. Run Python in Immediate mode\n\n \n Once Python is installed, typing `python` in the command line will invoke the interpreter in immediate mode. We can directly type in Python code, and press Enter to get the output.\n\nTry typing in `1 + 1` and press enter. We get `2` as the output. This prompt can be used as a calculator. To exit this mode, type `quit()` and press enter. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XP_2xZyKDMHhuhtMuRXTl.png?height=254&width=668)\n\n### 2. Run Python in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n\nWe can use any text editing software to write a Python script file.\n\nWe just need to save it with the `.py` extension. But using an IDE can make our life a lot easier. IDE is a piece of software that provides useful features like code hinting, syntax highlighting and checking, file explorers, etc. to the programmer for application development.\n\nBy the way, when you install Python, an IDE named **IDLE** is also installed. You can use it to run Python on your computer. It's a decent IDE for beginners.\n\nWhen you open IDLE, an interactive Python Shell is opened. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N_NQnUzjCR713d10Ufba7.png?height=328&width=624)\n\nNow you can create a new file and save it with **.py** extension. For example, **hello.py**\n\nWrite Python code in the file and save it. To run the file, go to **Run** > **Run Module** or simply click **F5**. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bOTCya_ibYVtpA0K3EkO4.png?height=527&width=844)\n\n## Your first Python Program\n\nNow that we have Python up and running, we can write our first Python program.\n\nLet's create a very simple program called `Hello World`. A **\"Hello, World!\"** is a simple program that outputs `Hello, World!` on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, it's often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners.\n\nType the following code in any text editor or an IDE and save it as `hello_world.py` \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FgJSJ5rhnaU3KgRm5fmmK.png?height=83&width=684)\n\nThen, run the file. You will get the following output. \n  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FNBrXEpZ_VV0-y2wUprh_.png?height=41&width=713)\n\nCongratulations! You just wrote your first program in Python.\n\nAs you can see, this was a pretty easy task. This is the beauty of the Python programming language. \n  \n Would you like to learn more?

A total of 177,690 vsKSM ($439 million) and 3,045,564 vsDOT ($21 million) was minted through the protocol.\n\nThe SALP protocol works by releasing the liquidity of tokens staked during an auction; liquid derivatives such as vsDOT and vsKSM are issued on a 1:1 basis for the tokens staked. Both vsDOT and vsKSM can be used for decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications, and rewards throughout the ecosystem as long as the native tokens remain locked for the duration of the parachain lease.\n\nThis avoids the opportunity cost of locking their coins. However, the new SALP 2.0 allows users to obtain liquid tokens via direct investment, not just via crowdloan participation. Tyrone Pan, head of development at Bifrost, commented:\n\n> \"The upgrading of SALP 2.0 is generating a Bond market for Crowdloan assets, improving the efficiency of vsToken & vsBond liquidity while lowering the threshold for users. This model not only facilitates Crowdloan users to manage derivatives, but also cleverly combines Crowdloan with DeFi.\"\n\nLiquid staking is a [relatively new phenomenon](https://cointelegraph.com/news/we-ll-see-about-200-chains-connected-through-cosmos-ibc-next-year-says-tendermint-ceo-peng-zhong) in the DeFi realm, created primarily to allow users to recover potential opportunity costs while staking their assets. The potential downside is their vulnerability to the changes in underlying assets as they are classified as DeFi derivatives. ", "timestamp": 1657011934, "digest": "QBpwOfsWwf5iH7ZjPblD2tSYBwpef6XoIyyob4iZzd4", "contributor": "0x5419AEF6D232A2168bEa5d9418C86493990c81e1"}

It added activity on the Bitcoin network is at levels concurrent with the deepest part of the bear market in 2018 and 2019, writing:\n\n> “The Bitcoin network is approaching a state where almost all speculative entities, and market tourists have been completely purged from the asset.”\n\nHowever, despite the almost complete purge of “tourists,” Glassnode noted significant accumulation levels, stating that the [balances of shrimps](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hodlers-and-whales-who-owns-the-most-bitcoin-in-2022) — those holding less than 1 BTC, and whales — those with 1,000 to 5,000 BTC, were “increasing meaningfully.”\n\nShrimps, in particular, see the current [Bitcoin prices](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-determines-the-bitcoin-price) as attractive and are [accumulating it at a rate](https://cointelegraph.com/news/can-t-stop-won-t-stop-bitcoin-hodlers-buy-the-dip-at-20k-btc) of almost 60,500 BTC per month, which Glassnode says is “the most aggressive rate in history,” equivalent to 0.32% of the BTC supply per month.\n\nExplaining the purge of these tourist-type investors, Glassnode revealed that both the number of active addresses and entities have seen a downtrend since November 2021, implying new and existing investors alike are not interacting with the network.\n\nAddress activity has fallen from over 1 million daily active addresses in November 2021 to around 870,000 per day over the past week. Similarly, active entities, a collation of multiple addresses owned by the same person or institution, are now approximately 244,000 per day, which Glassnode says is around the “lower end of the ‘Low Activity’ channel typical of bear markets.”\n\n“A retention of HODLers is more evident in this metric, as Active Entities is generally trending sideways, indicative of a stable base-load of users,” the analysts added.\n\n*Source: [Glassnode](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2022/?&utm_source=gn_twitter&utm_medium=insights_woc&utm_campaign=woc_27_2022)*\n\nThe growth of new entities has also dived to lows from the 2018 to 2019 bear market, with the user-base of Bitcoin hitting 7,000 daily net new entities.\n\nThe transaction count remains “stagnant and sideways,” which indicates a lack of new demand but also means that holders are being retained through the market conditions.\n\n*“Transactional demand can be seen to move sideways throughout the main body of the bear,” - [Glassnode](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-27-2022/?&utm_source=gn_twitter&utm_medium=insights_woc&utm_campaign=woc_27_2022)*\n\n***Related: [Institutional investors shorting Bitcoin made up 80% of weekly inflows](https://cointelegraph.com/news/institutional-investors-shorting-bitcoin-made-up-80-of-weekly-inflows)***\n\nDriving home its point, Glassnode concluded that the number of addresses with a non-zero balance, those that hold at least some Bitcoin, [continues](https://twitter.com/glassnodealerts/status/1544173111871954945) to hit all-time-highs and is currently sitting at over 42.3 million addresses.\n\nPast bear markets saw a purge of wallets when the price of Bitcoin collapsed.

{"id": "OZVFweh7h4Nq_Ylt3PYZbm1zkv5J4hzhf3v52uJZgpE", "title": "Learn Python Programming", "body": "Python is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is used in web development, data science, creating software prototypes, and so on. Fortunately for beginners, Python has simple easy-to-use syntax. This makes Python an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o5JCmg7JYZq0YaC33qXg0.png?height=420&width=1000)\n\nPython is a cross-platform programming language, which means that it can run on multiple platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, and has even been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines. It is free and open-source.\n\nEven though most of today's Linux and Mac have Python pre-installed in it, the version might be out-of-date. So, it is always a good idea to install the most current version. \n  \n The Easiest Way to Run Python\n\nThe easiest way to run Python is by using **Thonny IDE**.\n\nThe Thonny IDE comes with the latest version of Python bundled in it. So you don't have to install Python separately.\n\nFollow the following steps to run Python on your computer.\n\n1. Download [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/).\n2. Run the installer to install **Thonny** on your computer.\n3. Go to: **File** > **New**. Then save the file with `.py` extension. For example, `hello.py`, `example.py`, etc. \n You can give any name to the file. However, the file name should end with **.py**\n4. Write Python code in the file and save it. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2ir2MtjuRVSaCs9UY4T7L.png?height=483&width=805)\n\n* Then Go to **Run** > **Run current script** or simply click **F5** to run it. \n  \n **Install Python Separately**\n\n  If you don't want to use Thonny, here's how you can install and run Python on your computer.\n  1. Download the [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n  2. Run the installer file and follow the steps to install Python \n During the install process, check **Add Python to environment variables**. This will add Python to environment variables, and you can run Python from any part of the computer. \n  \n Also, you can choose the path where Python is installed. \n  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JRcQ0ZaHumsDM8aRPsZLC.png?height=340&width=550)\n\nOnce you finish the installation process, you can run Python.\n\n## 1. Run Python in Immediate mode\n\n \n Once Python is installed, typing `python` in the command line will invoke the interpreter in immediate mode. We can directly type in Python code, and press Enter to get the output.\n\nTry typing in `1 + 1` and press enter. We get `2` as the output. This prompt can be used as a calculator. To exit this mode, type `quit()` and press enter. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XP_2xZyKDMHhuhtMuRXTl.png?height=254&width=668)\n\n### 2. Run Python in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n\nWe can use any text editing software to write a Python script file.\n\nWe just need to save it with the `.py` extension. But using an IDE can make our life a lot easier. IDE is a piece of software that provides useful features like code hinting, syntax highlighting and checking, file explorers, etc. to the programmer for application development.\n\nBy the way, when you install Python, an IDE named **IDLE** is also installed. You can use it to run Python on your computer. It's a decent IDE for beginners.\n\nWhen you open IDLE, an interactive Python Shell is opened. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N_NQnUzjCR713d10Ufba7.png?height=328&width=624)\n\nNow you can create a new file and save it with **.py** extension. For example, **hello.py**\n\nWrite Python code in the file and save it. To run the file, go to **Run** > **Run Module** or simply click **F5**. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bOTCya_ibYVtpA0K3EkO4.png?height=527&width=844)\n\n## Your first Python Program\n\nNow that we have Python up and running, we can write our first Python program.\n\nLet's create a very simple program called `Hello World`. A **\"Hello, World!\"** is a simple program that outputs `Hello, World!` on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, it's often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners.\n\nType the following code in any text editor or an IDE and save it as `hello_world.py` \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FgJSJ5rhnaU3KgRm5fmmK.png?height=83&width=684)\n\nThen, run the file. You will get the following output. \n  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FNBrXEpZ_VV0-y2wUprh_.png?height=41&width=713)\n\nCongratulations! You just wrote your first program in Python.\n\nAs you can see, this was a pretty easy task. This is the beauty of the Python programming language. \n  \n Would you like to learn more?

She prepares me for my return; places single, white blossoms across the forehead of my Heart, above my crown. Protecting me and reminding me that I am eternally supported. That I am not only loved but that I **am** Love; that Love is all that I Am. She gently takes my hand and places it in my own. Where I am going, I must carry myself, she says. Where we are headed, the path is clear but still unknown. Its clarity lies in its clairvoyance; its whisper of eternity; its tender promise of eternity rooted in intimate trust; its vast picture of eternity planted inside of my mind, that I already knew what the pathway to infinity looks like, mapped out and ready for me to take my place as I settle in to a seat of surrender, a corner of curiosity, to turn on the tap and let the water flow effortlessly. To watch the hand of the Universe pull me in and install me with knowledge past, ancient wisdom and free me of fleeting temperance. To show me a new door, to a Now which looks nothing like the one I see before me, yet which feels strangely familiar in its welcoming acceptance. For me, as I am. For all that is, as it is. Here, I not only wait, but I choose. I choose my guidance as another me chooses the door in-front, behind, in the far left corner. I choose my experience and it enlightens my view. Shows me possibility and I lean farther into capability. When my inner child comes to play with me, I will tell her that she is safe. I will assure her inconsolable heart that she is deserving of receiving all that she gives. When she steps cautiously into my dreams, I will invite her lovingly to make her own choices. I will tell her that I could see her trepidation. For I, too, was peeking from behind the curtain to watch her imagination bloom. And, as in her wonder-filled eyes, I could see it in my own. I could feel the sparkle that I saw light up her path; could smell the petals she laid before her as stepping-stones into her truth, closer to me. Could sense the anguish which she asked with lightness, a playfulness unique to who she is, yet one that hides a plethora of angst. But she is the one who can turn fear into curiosity; is the one who can give love when she feels closed in. She is the silhouette who can come out of her own shadow when she creates from her Spark, when she steps in to her own, shapeshifting mould, when she hugs her bears tightly because it brings her closer with herself. \n\nI love her, so deeply.  \n I see her now, within me. \n Come forth, sweet one.

Ecosystem where you do not need to trust third parties to manage your funds, to gate access to your belongings, to make sure your “good” is taken care of.\n\nMost often this is a trap - what does it even mean “trustless”? \n\n[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trustless) says **trustless** means “*not deserving of trust*”. That is exactly the opposite of what web3, crypto and blockchain promise, right?\n\nI believe we cannot get rid of trust. Someone recently told me, while we were arguing about whether crypto & web3 makes any sense, that “*people require an authority to look up to and obey*”. I think he was not wrong. I believe there is something in our psyche which longs for being able to offload the decisions, to get rid of responsibility, to delegate the worries. Even when you look at our governments - we have elections, we may claim to vote for ther “experts” and those “fit” to lead the country, but all the majority really wants, is to be able to **trust** the leaders that they will do the right thing on behalf of citizens.\n\nSo why does this web3, crypto and blockchain world keep talking about trust like it is something bad?\n\nIn my opinion it is about “who” or “what” do you trust. Nothing in web3 is trustless. If we go from the top, \n\n1.

You need to trust the smart contract developers to not steal your money once you transfer them into the contract (and yes, you can review the code, but audits are hard and often not perfect, so even experts miss potential holes).\n3. You need to trust the miners/validators that they will not stop the chain from running altogether.\n\nI believe we should not strive for trustlessness, but for **openness** and **provability**. We will always need to put trust in others, but public blockchain and web3 layers allow us to build a different type of social graph which shows if someone who is giving us an advice actually is trustworthy.\n\nWe should be able to find a way to see if and auditor is trustful or trustless based on how many projects rugged after their audit.\n\nWe should be able to get reviews and recommendations by other members of community for what we did and then use those reviews as [claims](https://katelynsills.com/blockchain/soulbound-tokens/) when we want or need to prove ourselves to show we are trustful.\n\nWe no longer live in small communities where your mother knows all the neigbours and can tell you who to trust. We live in a global world where trust is also a global commodity. We need to find ways how to capture the trust put into us by others to be able to use it when someone is not sure whether to trust us or not.\n\nI believe this is where open public blockchains and web3 approaches can help us a lot.", "timestamp": 1657031754, "digest": "mRQrZsD6h9sc1hLm1znoXw_zfRorkMtwXC8cvP1xw8g", "contributor": "0x1D45c8fa65F6b18E7dAe04b2efEa332c55696DaA"}

A total of 177,690 vsKSM ($439 million) and 3,045,564 vsDOT ($21 million) was minted through the protocol.\n\nThe SALP protocol works by releasing the liquidity of tokens staked during an auction; liquid derivatives such as vsDOT and vsKSM are issued on a 1:1 basis for the tokens staked. Both vsDOT and vsKSM can be used for decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications, and rewards throughout the ecosystem as long as the native tokens remain locked for the duration of the parachain lease.\n\nThis avoids the opportunity cost of locking their coins. However, the new SALP 2.0 allows users to obtain liquid tokens via direct investment, not just via crowdloan participation. Tyrone Pan, head of development at Bifrost, commented:\n\n> \"The upgrading of SALP 2.0 is generating a Bond market for Crowdloan assets, improving the efficiency of vsToken & vsBond liquidity while lowering the threshold for users. This model not only facilitates Crowdloan users to manage derivatives, but also cleverly combines Crowdloan with DeFi.\"\n\nLiquid staking is a [relatively new phenomenon](https://cointelegraph.com/news/we-ll-see-about-200-chains-connected-through-cosmos-ibc-next-year-says-tendermint-ceo-peng-zhong) in the DeFi realm, created primarily to allow users to recover potential opportunity costs while staking their assets. The potential downside is their vulnerability to the changes in underlying assets as they are classified as DeFi derivatives. ", "timestamp": 1657011934, "digest": "QBpwOfsWwf5iH7ZjPblD2tSYBwpef6XoIyyob4iZzd4", "contributor": "0x5419AEF6D232A2168bEa5d9418C86493990c81e1"}

{"id": "QCjtFdGXh_c1Vzown_aAei2YmneH6n1PhPnI9JnBA-Q", "title": "Crypto community eyeing three macro events to tip crypto scales in July", "body": "The crypto community is looking into three key dates this month that could profoundly impact the trajectory of the crypto market and the wider United States macroeconomic environment this year. \n\nOn July 13, the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) and data relating to inflation will be released to the public. On July 26-27, a decision will be made as to whether to hike interest rates further, while on July 28, the United States Q2 2022 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates will tell us whether the country is in a technical recession.\n\n### July 13: Inflation marker, CPI\n\nMichaël van de Poppe, CEO and founder of crypto consultancy and educational platform EightGlobal, told his 614,300 Twitter followers on Monday that it’s “all eyes on the CPI data next week,” adding bullish forecasts for Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) should it flip above its $20,000 price point.\n\nCo-founder of The Crypto Academy, known on Twitter as Wolves of Crypto, [told](https://twitter.com/WolvesofCrypto_/status/1543925027317633024) his followers to keep an eye out for the date, adding that CPI going lower than expected “could be the catalyst for a dead cat bounce” for Bitcoin:\n\n> “All eyes on CPI numbers on July 13th. If CPI comes in lower, that will be the catalyst for a dead cat bounce.”\n\nCPI is one of the benchmarks for gauging how inflation progresses by measuring the average change in consumer prices based on a representative basket of household goods and services.\n\nContinued rising inflation could impact demand for cryptocurrencies, with consumers needing to spend more to get by than before.\n\nInterestingly, while Bitcoin was created amid high inflation following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, and touted as an inflation hedge due to its fixed supply and scarcity, recent years have seen the cryptocurrency perform in line with traditional tech stocks, being [less than inflation-proof](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/bitcoin-and-inflation-everything-you-need-to-know).\n\nThe next scheduled release of the CPI is [expected](https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/cpi.htm) on July 13, 2022, by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAccording to Trading Economics, the current consensus on the June inflation rate, or CPI, is 8.7%, slightly higher than May’s 8.6%.\n\n### July 26-27: Fed interest rate hike\n\nAfter raising interest rates by 75 basis points in June, one of the most significant monthly increases in 28 years, interest rates are expected to increase further following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later this month.\n\nInterest rate hikes are one of the primary tools used by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Central Bank to manage inflation by slowing down the economy. Increased interest rates lead to increases in borrowing costs, which can discourage consumer and business spending and lending.\n\nIt can also place downward pressure on [higher-risk asset prices](https://cointelegraph.com/news/80-000-bitcoin-millionaires-wiped-out-in-the-great-crypto-crash-of-2022), such as crypto, as investors can start to earn decent returns just by parking their money in interest-bearing accounts or low-risk assets.\n\nThis month, the FOMC is expected to decide whether to impose a 50 or 75 basis point hike. Charlie Bilello, founder and CEO of Compound Capital Advisors, placed his bets on the higher amount.\n\n### July 28: Are we in a recession?\n\nOn July 28, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) will release an advance estimate of the United States’ GDP for the second quarter of 2022.\n\nAfter registering a -1.6% GDP decline in Q1 2022, Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow tracker is now expecting a -2.1% decline in GDP growth for Q2 2022.\n\nA second consecutive quarter of GDP decline would place the United States into a “technical recession.”\n\n***Related: [On the brink of recession: Can Bitcoin survive its first global economic crisis?](https://cointelegraph.com/news/on-the-brink-of-recession-can-bitcoin-survive-its-first-global-economic-crisis)***\n\nShould the United States economy be officially labeled as a recession, which is [expected to begin in 2023](https://cointelegraph.com/news/on-the-brink-of-recession-can-bitcoin-survive-its-first-global-economic-crisis), Bitcoin will be facing its first-ever full-blown recession and is likely to see a continued decline alongside tech stocks.\n\n### Silver lining?\n\nDespite the gloomy macro forecasts, some of crypto’s leading pundits view the recent macro-catalyzed crypto market crash as an overall positive sign for the industry.\n\nCrypto expert Erik Voorhees, co-founder of Coinapult and CEO and founder of ShapeShift, said the current crypto crash is “least worrisome” to him, as it is the first crypto crash to result from macro factors outside of crypto.\n\nAlliance DAO core contributor Qiao Wang made similar comments to his 131,200 followers, [noting](https://twitter.com/QwQiao/status/1543964998749257728) that this is the first cycle where the main bear case was an “exogenous factor:”\n\n> “People who are worried about crypto because of macro realize how bullish this is right?”\n\n“This is the first cycle where the main bear case is an exogenous factor. In previous cycles, it was endogenous, e.g., Mt.Gox (2014) and ICOs (2018),” he explained.", "timestamp": 1657011752, "digest": "JiuJKDS4XswIk0yrYOpfRU2WeifEhJaBwvcUHmwEKVg", "contributor": "0xF02716289b2036d51283B9baEc327355F27381F9"}

I admire the work of military strategists, intelligence officials, and governments who have stepped into supplying the needed hardware. Most of all I admire the brave men and women of the Ukrainian military who make the ultimate sacrifice daily. But we can never lose sight of the larger purpose and the higher ground. Ultimately this is about peace, liberty, and justice. \n\nEisenhower warned of the “military-industrial complex.” He was talking about the people who made trillions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those same people see a trillion-dollar opportunity in Ukraine, which can not be. The political leadership can not outsource the war to that “military-industrial complex.” Because that would be to lose sight of the primary goal of this unfortunate war. \n\nThe sole focus can not be to outgun Putin. To try would be to fall into his trap. That is what he wants. That is what he understands. Perhaps Putin and Zelensky are not talking, but plenty of people are talking to Putin and should keep on talking. All global players who have Putin’s ears should step in and play a role to help deescalate. This war is already global. Look at the food crisis in Africa. \n\nAll countries directly impacted by the blockage of Ukraine’s wheat by Putin’s mines in the Black Sea should ramp up the pressure on Putin. This war is not about Donbas. This is about Putin wanting to stay in power for 20 more years. A dictator needs his wars for domestic reasons. \n\nScotland has the democratic right and option to break away from Britain. Ukraine should be willing to say it is ready for such an eventuality for Crimea and Donbas. That Russia might not reciprocate is not an issue. Russia is not a democracy. Ukraine is. This offer should be relentlessly made through all available channels. Conquest can not be allowed. But the people of Crimea and Donbas can, in an internationally organized referendum, choose to do the Scotland and Quebec thing. That should be Ukraine’s stand. The stand is the political option to push the Russian military out. There you up the pressure as much as possible. And that political campaign also weakens Putin militarily. Why do you want to go down the path of death and destruction when you can easily have the same through a referendum? People in his own camp will ask. And no matter how the Russian military steps out, that weakens the Putin regime in Moscow. The strongman starts looking like a strawman. The madman starts looking like the madman he is. And despite the referendum carrot, if he does not step back, that saps the morale of the Russian forces. That also weakens him militarily. A military defeat of Putin in Donbas becomes much more possible after you hit on the head relentlessly with this political solution. \n\nThe political solution has to be primary. The economic sanctions are secondary. The military solution has to be tertiary. \n\n![](https://www.history.com/.image/t_share/MTYyODEwNTIzMDQ4NTUyMDI0/general-eisenhower-gettyimages-107758850.jpg)\n\n[crowdfund://0x4C2380d1548bbf533F0336225Bb9A7784BCDF2f8?features=overview,editions,podium,backers](crowdfund://0x4C2380d1548bbf533F0336225Bb9A7784BCDF2f8?features=overview,editions,podium,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1656256677, "digest": "Qf7igYYqjAli56jtIIYW-e3g8shDVvpe5xU2_rKo_cY", "contributor": "0x065e533120b87e5b4F5bfBF0802EB6428c237487"}

Maybe it is not even possible to do that. Maybe “trustless” just means “as little trust put into a stranger as possible”. Let’s explore.\n\nBlockchain and web3 (or web5, or web42) promise a trustless environment. Ecosystem where you do not need to trust third parties to manage your funds, to gate access to your belongings, to make sure your “good” is taken care of.\n\nMost often this is a trap - what does it even mean “trustless”? \n\n[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trustless) says **trustless** means “*not deserving of trust*”. That is exactly the opposite of what web3, crypto and blockchain promise, right?\n\nI believe we cannot get rid of trust. Someone recently told me, while we were arguing about whether crypto & web3 makes any sense, that “*people require an authority to look up to and obey*”. I think he was not wrong. I believe there is something in our psyche which longs for being able to offload the decisions, to get rid of responsibility, to delegate the worries. Even when you look at our governments - we have elections, we may claim to vote for ther “experts” and those “fit” to lead the country, but all the majority really wants, is to be able to **trust** the leaders that they will do the right thing on behalf of citizens.\n\nSo why does this web3, crypto and blockchain world keep talking about trust like it is something bad?\n\nIn my opinion it is about “who” or “what” do you trust. Nothing in web3 is trustless. If we go from the top, \n\n1. You need to trust the website developer to do everything right, so that you don’t interact with a wrong/malicious contract and lose money.\n2. You need to trust the smart contract developers to not steal your money once you transfer them into the contract (and yes, you can review the code, but audits are hard and often not perfect, so even experts miss potential holes).\n3. You need to trust the miners/validators that they will not stop the chain from running altogether.\n\nI believe we should not strive for trustlessness, but for **openness** and **provability**. We will always need to put trust in others, but public blockchain and web3 layers allow us to build a different type of social graph which shows if someone who is giving us an advice actually is trustworthy.\n\nWe should be able to find a way to see if and auditor is trustful or trustless based on how many projects rugged after their audit.\n\nWe should be able to get reviews and recommendations by other members of community for what we did and then use those reviews as [claims](https://katelynsills.com/blockchain/soulbound-tokens/) when we want or need to prove ourselves to show we are trustful.\n\nWe no longer live in small communities where your mother knows all the neigbours and can tell you who to trust. We live in a global world where trust is also a global commodity. We need to find ways how to capture the trust put into us by others to be able to use it when someone is not sure whether to trust us or not.\n\nI believe this is where open public blockchains and web3 approaches can help us a lot.", "timestamp": 1657031754, "digest": "mRQrZsD6h9sc1hLm1znoXw_zfRorkMtwXC8cvP1xw8g", "contributor": "0x1D45c8fa65F6b18E7dAe04b2efEa332c55696DaA"}

{"id": "rinlBTtBUxrUUlr89pI-tZXDsLowQTMxuu5usujCB_k", "title": "BTC Cycle – Formula Don’t Lie", "body": "**Research report – BTC market**\n\n*February 21, 2022*\n\n§  Bitcoin (“BTC”) is a Proof-of-Work blockchain that requires validators help validating transactions (hash functions) to support public ledger\n\n§  Validators compete computing power against others in the network for validating hashes, the validation process is called mining\n\n§  Validators are rewarded with BTC for validating the blocks, which is called block rewards\n\n§  Hash rate and halving are the key concepts that drive block rewards and block validation speed, which drives the BTC price\n\n§  Unlike other traditional commodities, BTC supply is determined by mathematical formula\n\n**Fundamentals that determine BTC Price – Hash Rate**\n\nThe fundamental element that drives BTC supply is the hash rate, which is related to the network difficulty (how difficult to validate the hash function). Network difficulty is directly correlated to the total hash rate according to the hash function formula, and the general principle is that the network difficulty gradually increases overtime. \n \n\n![Figure 1: BTC Total Hash Rate (TH/s)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uP8UZQvUr3n3mI16GLmob.png?height=347&width=852)\n\n![Figure 2: BTC Price (2012 – 2022)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jBnnh5OjFfWrlzCcLxfKo.png?height=328&width=824)\n\n**Fundamentals that determine BTC Price – Half-Life**\n\nApart from network difficulty, another key factor that drive BTC price is block reward. Half-life is a primary feature of BTC’s Proof-of-Work mechanism, where block rewards are halved every four years. This is a very important concept, and we will assess the impact of halving to BTC price in further details below.\n\n![Figure 3: BTC Half-life schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iCXll2_eDdd5Tc4-WQVce.png?height=115&width=368)\n\n **What shall we expect in and after Half-life**\n\nUnder BTC’s PoW mechanism, BTC would experience a half-life in 2024, meaning that miners’ block rewards would be halved to 3.125BTC per block (currently 6.25BTC).\n\nIt is interesting that BTC price has experienced a bull run at every “Halving Cycles”. The bull run in 2012 lasted for 372 days, BTC price surged from US$15 to US$512 (peaked at US$1,217), while 2016’s bull run lasted 526 days, the price jumped from US$647 to US$3,276 (peaked at US$19,800). In latest 2020 halving, BTC price also surged from $8,787 to $50,000 (peaked at $67,000).\n\nThe bull run could be explained by price discovery by the market on BTC’s scarcity. We observe that BTC price fits closest to the stock-to-flow model at year of half-life and after.\n\n**Where we are currently**\n\nThe market demand for BTC is currently very low, and it can be demonstrated from AAVE[\\[2\\]](#_ftn2) and Curve’s funding rate. We can understand AAVE and Curve funding rate as the risk-free rate in the crypto world. The funding rate is driven by the propensity to borrow and lend in the market.\n\nWith only 2.7% of the BTC pool being utilized, we think that the current BTC market is currently underwhelmed. This is largely due to its non-interoperability with other chains, compared to USDT[\\[3\\]](#_ftn3) and DAI. The current funding rate of USDT and DAI are 1.97% and 2.25%, meaning that market is more attracted to holding and lending stable coin.\n\n![AAVE FUNDING RATE](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m--SywZt0ydBWbKN765RQ.png?height=335&width=667)\n\n![CURVE POOL BTC STAKING YIELD](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vftiRJypKbDZe8ptX3cx8.png?height=524&width=685)\n\n*\\*Data extracted as of 21st February 2022*\n\n \n\n**Halve life pattern – Formula don’t lie**\n\nBased on our fundamental analysis on BTC half life, I reckon that the earliest bull run shall come in early 2024. Another observation is that BTC market share falls gradually to less than 30%. Despite the upside in each bull run seems less than the one before, this is primarily due to rapid expansion in other crypto ecosystems. The rapid growth in Ethereum and other alternative layer 1 have demonstrated robust growth in the latest bull run, and we view that expansion of other ecosystem is a healthy phenomenon to the crypto industry as a whole.\n\n![BTC Bull Run – BTC Index](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y1n034ZP0VXSuayfLcJPZ.png?height=479&width=705)\n\n \n\n![BTC Performance](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IquFRxMbXhLSX_325cmOl.png?height=366&width=175)\n\n \n\n*Data Source: Bitfinex*\n\n\n---\n\n[\\[1\\]](#_ftnref1) Source: Blockchain.com; Bitfinex\n\n[\\[2\\]](#_ftnref2) AAVE is the largest lending defi protocol; Curve is the largest decentralized liquidity pool for stablecoin trading \n\n[\\[3\\]](#_ftnref3) USDT and DAI are the two largest stable coin circulated by market cap.\n\n*- jhdegen*", "timestamp": 1657027296, "digest": "o-h2C1GE8E3KOWyk1XRrtZgOi6Dfl9XXYkdod1n5YZ4", "contributor": "0x3538e59e3ABfcB5225f0bfF83073BAAC587caF86"}

{"id": "SqBiIuWiB3mVGADLdADJXv9q_qWUymcohxPTlZLso-U", "title": "元宇宙观察系列七：张麻子如何闯入加密无人深空\n", "body": "## 存在不太一样的创业道路\n\n\n张麻子是让子弹飞里的一个故事主人公，他带着自己的队伍，进入了黄四郎管理的城市，人很少，但推翻了黄四郎的治理，让旧有的沉重赋税和架构都被打破\n\n\n在传统领域，大多数项目是靠自己的产品，通过营销让用户知道了自己的产品，同时满足了法币用户的某种需求，获得了持续的收入\n\n\n这种商业模式在区块链领域依旧是存在的\n\n\n但张麻子的行为，则更像加密世界一些激进创业者与他们做项目的新方式\n在讨论之前，先来看一下大概加密世界的用户分布，理解一下加密的无人深空\n\n\nETH日活目前为38万地址左右，日均交易与去年交易量持平，注册地址近2亿个（不去重）\n​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m9fV9JQ0oKta9VlA4XhDs.png?height=612&width=1440)\n\n  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XO4XNcmCbFPnUJl2mo8k_.png?height=604&width=1440)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n7-Ik4ZGv7cwDXbHZiezu.png?height=712&width=1684)\n\nCoinbase的22年Q1，月均交易用户数920万，同比增长50.82%，环比下降19.3% 21年Coinbase的已核实注册用户为5600万人，币安21年注册用户数可查的数据是2800万以上，曾经火币的18-19年巅峰期用户是在1500万注册 由此可见，区块链日活目前还是集中在中心化交易所，链上行为的日活还在增长阶段，虽然有很多的钱包地址，但交互的数量还是较少的 ​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ao_aSqRB4qhgd9XW8MxJw.png?height=555&width=1440)\n\n\nNFT的日活目前则是在10万人左右，总人口不超过300万人\n在这些数字背后的故事，就是区块链目前是一个满是金子的无人深空\n总人口和日活不如某国内部分约炮app，但估值一度与世界前十的资产持平\n\n## \n黑暗森林与金字塔\n\n\n在链上的数据可查可看、开发开源的情况下，无人深空也成为了黑暗森林\n作为一个在二级市场暴富然后归零的韭菜，体会到的一个重点就是，区块链的阶级是层层传导的金字塔\n\n\n和传统世界的抽税阶级和纳税阶级不同，其更想要去维稳整体的架构，人们被迫被均值回归成为普通人\n印钞就是控制的手段之一\n\n区块链的阶级更像是被加速的养老金结构，在这个过程中，生态位更高的人，成本更低的人，会收割韭菜\n但也会在博弈之中，催生更多、更快、更迅猛的阶级变化和碰撞\n大家的主要猎物一方面是多印的钞票，一方面是其他人的钱包\n财富的阶级还没有在这里被完全固化与限定\n但这个前提在于，要有足够的钱，和\n足够多的新人\n\n## \n无人深空的流量增长\n\n\nWeb 3依旧是流量生意\n最近很多web2的创业者开始闯入web3的浪潮，但是大部分在一级市场融资就陷入困境，之后项目也是越做越凉，最后割的就是投资方\n\n其最主要的原因就是web2的传统产品思维困住了这些人\n其实，web3需要的是张麻子，敢带着4个人，拉来一座城的人，去抢钱\n​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rSfZd1eIf74rjcEZQmM7l.png?height=796&width=1194)\n\n\n在web3创业初始，如果推特和discord能有几万个活跃的用户，其实会有很多资方和资源主动找到项目，这个是因为真实的流量，会比埋头做一个产品、讲一个叙事要更有说服力\n\n\n这是金字塔结构自上而下传导下来的，交易所需要源源不断的新增用户和项目，项目其中一个重要的任务，就是吸引用户加入加密世界\n而现阶段web3的用户与web2用户的一个重要区别在于，大家是天然的投资者，主要的需求不是吃喝住行，而是赚钱，吃喝住行已经有了非常成熟的解决方案，但赚钱不行\n\n所以如果项目在流量这个事情上折戟成沙\n\n则大概率也说明了其产品、故事、团队、模型的不成功 \n\nweb3的用户是主动去找项目的，因为谁赢了，他们才会帮谁 \n\n好项目不缺资源，但有些项目怎么样都缺少资源，这才是真正的原因 \n\n## 如何做一个张麻子 \n\n在分析如何做好一个项目上，大部分的文章剖析都偏向于复盘向，即一个项目火了之后，大家再去剖析其为什么火 \n\n我更偏向于从投资人、web3的用户（韭菜）角度去分析这个事情，就引申出了几个有意思的流量玩法的分析 \n\n记住我们之前的web3用户解读： 1. 大家都是投资人 2. 大家来赚钱的 \n\n那么对于张麻子而言 \n\n第一，要师出有名，要有足够的背书，让我相信他们有钱、有人脉 \n\n第二，团队要能搞钱，或者让我信他们能搞钱 \n\n第三，武器要好，产品要让我觉得有投资的安全感 \n\n第四，要自己敢打敢拼，要先赢了，我才会跟着 \n\n第五，滚雪球，先得有一批信徒，才有一群人，我才敢上 ...... \n\n## 邀请码的故事：枪在手，跟我走 \n\n对于web2用户而言，邀请码是反常识的，是被人玩烂了，用烂了的方式 但对于一个能赚钱的项目而言，邀请码就是让小众用户社区，破圈到大众用户的一个重要方式 因为你的传递速率是2的次方级，大家传递的原因很简单\n\n我需要拉人进来接盘、想让朋友一起赚钱\n\n外面的朋友也想进来赚钱\n\n我需要有一个理由推荐项目 每个韭菜都需要一个引路人和体面\n\n## 白名单与空投的故事：枪弹在你手，9成财富在碉楼\n\n白名单和空投只是获取用户的手段，大部分的项目都会暗示空投、发白名单的方式去许诺后期利益，9成的财富在未来等着\n\n去鼓励用户的交互与热度 \n\n这样投资方能看得到数据，交易所能看得到未来的持币地址 \n\n才会有投资、才会有币发 \n\n但发枪弹之后，随之而来的问题则在于 \n\n一、我拿了枪弹，我会不会被打死？ \n\n二、我拿了枪弹，为什么要跟着他们一起冲？ \n\n张麻子的方式是，杀了黄四郎的替身，假装赢了，引爆了所有人的情绪，大家就一起上了 \n\n也就是，要让所有人觉得，赢了，fomo了，死而无憾了 \n\n上币安也好，A16Z也罢 \n\n需要无数的利好与真正的杀手锏 \n\n## 代币模型：浦东就是上海 \n\n在代币模型上，到底激励了谁 \n\n项目的利益决定了队伍的走向 \n\n在部分gamefi产品的设计上，由于让利给了公会、团队、投资人，反而伤害了很多新玩家的利益，导致死亡螺旋 \n\n在部分应用层产品设计上，存在明确的抽税阶级，凌驾于其他人的利益，导致难以长期未计 \n\n谁是支持者，在什么阶段，谁获得了利益，这是模型要考虑的，模型设定死的 \n\n例如一个早期项目，如果没有理解谁是需要在这个阶段讨好的、激励的对象，那么大概率就是折戟成沙 \n\n在每一个阶段给正确的群体激励，才能实现自己的阶级利益 \n\n比如说 一个无法融资的gamefi产品，需要激励的大概率就是投资方，代币设计要给投资方足够低的筹码，足够吸引人的价格 \n\n一个自带流量的gamefi产品，需要激励的就是新玩家，那么设计上则需要nft控价，代币发放速率非常陡峭且缓慢 \n\n一个没有流量，满手融资的产品，则需要激励的就是用户，那么设计上就应该大规模空投、做市场、置换宣发资源、吸血鬼攻击 \n\n最终，都是服务自己所处的阶级的利益，这是建立一个村庄，不是提供服务换取回报 \n\n## 最后的讨论：流量与产品之争 \n\n在传统游戏上，最近有一个激烈的探讨 \n\n在现在的行情下，是发行重要，还是产品重要？ \n\n有的人说都重要，有人说产品牛逼吊打一切，有人说没发行，产品不会有玩家，好死 \n\n其实大家都对 只是要看每个人具体有什么样的牌和条件 \n\n不是所有人都有着你所拥有的优厚条件\n\n引导到区块链领域，这个问题更像是如何把自己的木桶补齐 \n\n确实存在流量、团队、产品、投资方、生态等等都看似完美的无缺木桶 \n\n但绝大部分都有短板 如何在已知自己的短板上，平衡发行 vs 产品这样的问题？ \n\n没有标准答案，也许这就是为什么创业项目其实是九死一生的原因吧\n\n过往文字：\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/FwwApwwA3Z3_zfoBZ858EjWLKQhpysA1-IkDfBBY3X8](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/FwwApwwA3Z3_zfoBZ858EjWLKQhpysA1-IkDfBBY3X8)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/eqZDIExIlh5SWLY_AyVmZ2ji2O98itG_73DbumXpky0](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/eqZDIExIlh5SWLY_AyVmZ2ji2O98itG_73DbumXpky0)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/3mYy6PSYhIcxwgSmK8bhrdeLZz7GA4Ne5GnnsKf8Fos](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/3mYy6PSYhIcxwgSmK8bhrdeLZz7GA4Ne5GnnsKf8Fos)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/Q9OwuxJDjpDULcR4vC9EKn8BP-Zq5YvSs7fHM7rDLlA](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/Q9OwuxJDjpDULcR4vC9EKn8BP-Zq5YvSs7fHM7rDLlA)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/BUB-x4wQX1GTKx_bmb_WMagIdM7l3R7jEUrhrCczf4E](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/BUB-x4wQX1GTKx_bmb_WMagIdM7l3R7jEUrhrCczf4E)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/0wmMy0NQfH3btKsYRLeUgjtQvbhGHyRpukn0zuJ743U](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/0wmMy0NQfH3btKsYRLeUgjtQvbhGHyRpukn0zuJ743U)\n\n也可以来看看我的推特：

Polium [says](https://medium.com/@Polium_/polium-one-the-worlds-first-multi-chain-gaming-console-5052a44594c8) its community will help them build the console’s hardware and software and states it will have a functional prototype in “a few months.”\n\nAccording to Polium, the console will feature its own [multichain cryptocurrency wallet](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happens-if-you-lose-or-break-your-hardware-crypto-wallet), and the controller will have a wallet button for users to make trades more efficiently. Security and verification of transactions from the console will be enabled via a fingerprint scanner on the controller.\n\nThe console's price is unknown, but Polium does plan to mint a “Polium Pass” NFT, which will allow holders to claim a console on the initial launch day. Pass holders will receive another NFT, which in the future can be staked for a “PLAY” token, the console's native token for transacting on its marketplace app.\n\nPolium plans on releasing 10,000 consoles to Polium Pass holders and partners on the Q3 2024 initial launch, with more units manufactured for the public in Q3 2025. It has set a goal of selling over 1 million units.\n\nThe company has already received criticism for its logo looking similar to another popular console, the Nintendo GameCube. Polium said it didn’t copy the logo and is [already](https://twitter.com/Polium__/status/1543962020151758848) creating a new logo “that is original.”\n\n### Chinese tech giants to check ID before NFT purchases\n\nChina’s NFT industry players and the country’s largest technology firms have signed an agreement to check the identity of users using digital collectible trading platforms, according to a [report](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3184021/china-nfts-tencent-and-ant-group-join-industry-pledge-ban) on July 4 from the South China Morning Post.\n\nA so-called “self-discipline initiative” document was signed by companies with a stake in China’s NFT market, such as JD.com, Tencent Holdings, Baidu, and digital payments platform Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba Group.\n\nThe document was [published](http://www.chncia.org/xiehuidongtai-detail.php?mid=19&id=7041) on June 30 by the China Cultural Industry Association and, while not legally binding, calls on the firms to “require real-name authentication of those who issue, sell and buy” NFTs, and “only support legal tender as the denomination and settlement currency.”\n\nThe initiative also seeks for the companies to promise not to create secondary marketplaces for NFTs to [combat trading speculation](https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-state-media-signals-tighter-crypto-regulations-in-terra-aftermath).\n\nThe popularity of NFTs in China is on the rise, and digital collectable platforms [have grown 5X in just four months](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-platforms-in-china-grow-5x-in-four-months-despite-government-warnings) from February to mid-June 2022 despite multiple warnings from the government.\n\n### Nike looking to create video game NFTs\n\nA [patent](https://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=nike&OS=nike&RS=nike) filed by Nike Inc. on June 30 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) shows the fitness clothier is interested in a “video game integration” of NFTs.\n\nAs per the filing, Nike seeks to patent a method where a “virtual object” will display in games, where that object is a “virtual shoe, article of apparel, headgear, avatar, or pet.” Other language in the filing suggests Nike plans to sell the physical shoes and clothes represented within the NFTs.\n\n***Related: [NFT hype evidently dead as daily sales in June 2022 dip to one-year lows](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-hype-evidently-dead-as-daily-sales-in-june-2022-dip-to-one-year-lows)***\n\nThe reasoning presented in the filing suggests Nike is concerned with counterfeit digital collectibles and says there “exists a need for a retailer to more directly influence and control the nature and ultimate supply of digital objects within this virtual market.”\n\nIt also reasons an opportunity exists for it to capitalize and engage with video game players as most games feature customizable characters, which could make them “more engaged with a brand in the physical world.”\n\n### More Nifty News:\n\nThe second-largest sale of an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domain not only in U.S. dollars but also in Ethereum happened on July 3 when the domain “000.eth” [sold](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x57f1887a8bf19b14fc0df6fd9b2acc9af147ea85/24293655359084398983762148957951887367734741115283469135310733710692111186993) for 300 ETH, roughly $320,000.

She prepares me for my return; places single, white blossoms across the forehead of my Heart, above my crown. Protecting me and reminding me that I am eternally supported. That I am not only loved but that I **am** Love; that Love is all that I Am. She gently takes my hand and places it in my own. Where I am going, I must carry myself, she says. Where we are headed, the path is clear but still unknown. Its clarity lies in its clairvoyance; its whisper of eternity; its tender promise of eternity rooted in intimate trust; its vast picture of eternity planted inside of my mind, that I already knew what the pathway to infinity looks like, mapped out and ready for me to take my place as I settle in to a seat of surrender, a corner of curiosity, to turn on the tap and let the water flow effortlessly. To watch the hand of the Universe pull me in and install me with knowledge past, ancient wisdom and free me of fleeting temperance. To show me a new door, to a Now which looks nothing like the one I see before me, yet which feels strangely familiar in its welcoming acceptance. For me, as I am. For all that is, as it is. Here, I not only wait, but I choose. I choose my guidance as another me chooses the door in-front, behind, in the far left corner. I choose my experience and it enlightens my view. Shows me possibility and I lean farther into capability. When my inner child comes to play with me, I will tell her that she is safe. I will assure her inconsolable heart that she is deserving of receiving all that she gives. When she steps cautiously into my dreams, I will invite her lovingly to make her own choices. I will tell her that I could see her trepidation. For I, too, was peeking from behind the curtain to watch her imagination bloom. And, as in her wonder-filled eyes, I could see it in my own. I could feel the sparkle that I saw light up her path; could smell the petals she laid before her as stepping-stones into her truth, closer to me. Could sense the anguish which she asked with lightness, a playfulness unique to who she is, yet one that hides a plethora of angst. But she is the one who can turn fear into curiosity; is the one who can give love when she feels closed in. She is the silhouette who can come out of her own shadow when she creates from her Spark, when she steps in to her own, shapeshifting mould, when she hugs her bears tightly because it brings her closer with herself. \n\nI love her, so deeply.  \n I see her now, within me. \n Come forth, sweet one.

存在不太一样的创业道路\n\n\n张麻子是让子弹飞里的一个故事主人公，他带着自己的队伍，进入了黄四郎管理的城市，人很少，但推翻了黄四郎的治理，让旧有的沉重赋税和架构都被打破\n\n\n在传统领域，大多数项目是靠自己的产品，通过营销让用户知道了自己的产品，同时满足了法币用户的某种需求，获得了持续的收入\n\n\n这种商业模式在区块链领域依旧是存在的\n\n\n但张麻子的行为，则更像加密世界一些激进创业者与他们做项目的新方式\n在讨论之前，先来看一下大概加密世界的用户分布，理解一下加密的无人深空\n\n\nETH日活目前为38万地址左右，日均交易与去年交易量持平，注册地址近2亿个（不去重）\n​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m9fV9JQ0oKta9VlA4XhDs.png?height=612&width=1440)\n\n  \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XO4XNcmCbFPnUJl2mo8k_.png?height=604&width=1440)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n7-Ik4ZGv7cwDXbHZiezu.png?height=712&width=1684)\n\nCoinbase的22年Q1，月均交易用户数920万，同比增长50.82%，环比下降19.3% 21年Coinbase的已核实注册用户为5600万人，币安21年注册用户数可查的数据是2800万以上，曾经火币的18-19年巅峰期用户是在1500万注册 由此可见，区块链日活目前还是集中在中心化交易所，链上行为的日活还在增长阶段，虽然有很多的钱包地址，但交互的数量还是较少的 ​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ao_aSqRB4qhgd9XW8MxJw.png?height=555&width=1440)\n\n\nNFT的日活目前则是在10万人左右，总人口不超过300万人\n在这些数字背后的故事，就是区块链目前是一个满是金子的无人深空\n总人口和日活不如某国内部分约炮app，但估值一度与世界前十的资产持平\n\n## \n黑暗森林与金字塔\n\n\n在链上的数据可查可看、开发开源的情况下，无人深空也成为了黑暗森林\n作为一个在二级市场暴富然后归零的韭菜，体会到的一个重点就是，区块链的阶级是层层传导的金字塔\n\n\n和传统世界的抽税阶级和纳税阶级不同，其更想要去维稳整体的架构，人们被迫被均值回归成为普通人\n印钞就是控制的手段之一\n\n区块链的阶级更像是被加速的养老金结构，在这个过程中，生态位更高的人，成本更低的人，会收割韭菜\n但也会在博弈之中，催生更多、更快、更迅猛的阶级变化和碰撞\n大家的主要猎物一方面是多印的钞票，一方面是其他人的钱包\n财富的阶级还没有在这里被完全固化与限定\n但这个前提在于，要有足够的钱，和\n足够多的新人\n\n## \n无人深空的流量增长\n\n\nWeb 3依旧是流量生意\n最近很多web2的创业者开始闯入web3的浪潮，但是大部分在一级市场融资就陷入困境，之后项目也是越做越凉，最后割的就是投资方\n\n其最主要的原因就是web2的传统产品思维困住了这些人\n其实，web3需要的是张麻子，敢带着4个人，拉来一座城的人，去抢钱\n​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rSfZd1eIf74rjcEZQmM7l.png?height=796&width=1194)\n\n\n在web3创业初始，如果推特和discord能有几万个活跃的用户，其实会有很多资方和资源主动找到项目，这个是因为真实的流量，会比埋头做一个产品、讲一个叙事要更有说服力\n\n\n这是金字塔结构自上而下传导下来的，交易所需要源源不断的新增用户和项目，项目其中一个重要的任务，就是吸引用户加入加密世界\n而现阶段web3的用户与web2用户的一个重要区别在于，大家是天然的投资者，主要的需求不是吃喝住行，而是赚钱，吃喝住行已经有了非常成熟的解决方案，但赚钱不行\n\n所以如果项目在流量这个事情上折戟成沙\n\n则大概率也说明了其产品、故事、团队、模型的不成功 \n\nweb3的用户是主动去找项目的，因为谁赢了，他们才会帮谁 \n\n好项目不缺资源，但有些项目怎么样都缺少资源，这才是真正的原因 \n\n## 如何做一个张麻子 \n\n在分析如何做好一个项目上，大部分的文章剖析都偏向于复盘向，即一个项目火了之后，大家再去剖析其为什么火 \n\n我更偏向于从投资人、web3的用户（韭菜）角度去分析这个事情，就引申出了几个有意思的流量玩法的分析 \n\n记住我们之前的web3用户解读： 1. 大家都是投资人 2. 大家来赚钱的 \n\n那么对于张麻子而言 \n\n第一，要师出有名，要有足够的背书，让我相信他们有钱、有人脉 \n\n第二，团队要能搞钱，或者让我信他们能搞钱 \n\n第三，武器要好，产品要让我觉得有投资的安全感 \n\n第四，要自己敢打敢拼，要先赢了，我才会跟着 \n\n第五，滚雪球，先得有一批信徒，才有一群人，我才敢上 ...... \n\n## 邀请码的故事：枪在手，跟我走 \n\n对于web2用户而言，邀请码是反常识的，是被人玩烂了，用烂了的方式 但对于一个能赚钱的项目而言，邀请码就是让小众用户社区，破圈到大众用户的一个重要方式 因为你的传递速率是2的次方级，大家传递的原因很简单\n\n我需要拉人进来接盘、想让朋友一起赚钱\n\n外面的朋友也想进来赚钱\n\n我需要有一个理由推荐项目 每个韭菜都需要一个引路人和体面\n\n## 白名单与空投的故事：枪弹在你手，9成财富在碉楼\n\n白名单和空投只是获取用户的手段，大部分的项目都会暗示空投、发白名单的方式去许诺后期利益，9成的财富在未来等着\n\n去鼓励用户的交互与热度 \n\n这样投资方能看得到数据，交易所能看得到未来的持币地址 \n\n才会有投资、才会有币发 \n\n但发枪弹之后，随之而来的问题则在于 \n\n一、我拿了枪弹，我会不会被打死？ \n\n二、我拿了枪弹，为什么要跟着他们一起冲？ \n\n张麻子的方式是，杀了黄四郎的替身，假装赢了，引爆了所有人的情绪，大家就一起上了 \n\n也就是，要让所有人觉得，赢了，fomo了，死而无憾了 \n\n上币安也好，A16Z也罢 \n\n需要无数的利好与真正的杀手锏 \n\n## 代币模型：浦东就是上海 \n\n在代币模型上，到底激励了谁 \n\n项目的利益决定了队伍的走向 \n\n在部分gamefi产品的设计上，由于让利给了公会、团队、投资人，反而伤害了很多新玩家的利益，导致死亡螺旋 \n\n在部分应用层产品设计上，存在明确的抽税阶级，凌驾于其他人的利益，导致难以长期未计 \n\n谁是支持者，在什么阶段，谁获得了利益，这是模型要考虑的，模型设定死的 \n\n例如一个早期项目，如果没有理解谁是需要在这个阶段讨好的、激励的对象，那么大概率就是折戟成沙 \n\n在每一个阶段给正确的群体激励，才能实现自己的阶级利益 \n\n比如说 一个无法融资的gamefi产品，需要激励的大概率就是投资方，代币设计要给投资方足够低的筹码，足够吸引人的价格 \n\n一个自带流量的gamefi产品，需要激励的就是新玩家，那么设计上则需要nft控价，代币发放速率非常陡峭且缓慢 \n\n一个没有流量，满手融资的产品，则需要激励的就是用户，那么设计上就应该大规模空投、做市场、置换宣发资源、吸血鬼攻击 \n\n最终，都是服务自己所处的阶级的利益，这是建立一个村庄，不是提供服务换取回报 \n\n## 最后的讨论：流量与产品之争 \n\n在传统游戏上，最近有一个激烈的探讨 \n\n在现在的行情下，是发行重要，还是产品重要？ \n\n有的人说都重要，有人说产品牛逼吊打一切，有人说没发行，产品不会有玩家，好死 \n\n其实大家都对 只是要看每个人具体有什么样的牌和条件 \n\n不是所有人都有着你所拥有的优厚条件\n\n引导到区块链领域，这个问题更像是如何把自己的木桶补齐 \n\n确实存在流量、团队、产品、投资方、生态等等都看似完美的无缺木桶 \n\n但绝大部分都有短板 如何在已知自己的短板上，平衡发行 vs 产品这样的问题？ \n\n没有标准答案，也许这就是为什么创业项目其实是九死一生的原因吧\n\n过往文字：\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/FwwApwwA3Z3_zfoBZ858EjWLKQhpysA1-IkDfBBY3X8](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/FwwApwwA3Z3_zfoBZ858EjWLKQhpysA1-IkDfBBY3X8)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/eqZDIExIlh5SWLY_AyVmZ2ji2O98itG_73DbumXpky0](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/eqZDIExIlh5SWLY_AyVmZ2ji2O98itG_73DbumXpky0)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/3mYy6PSYhIcxwgSmK8bhrdeLZz7GA4Ne5GnnsKf8Fos](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/3mYy6PSYhIcxwgSmK8bhrdeLZz7GA4Ne5GnnsKf8Fos)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/Q9OwuxJDjpDULcR4vC9EKn8BP-Zq5YvSs7fHM7rDLlA](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/Q9OwuxJDjpDULcR4vC9EKn8BP-Zq5YvSs7fHM7rDLlA)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/BUB-x4wQX1GTKx_bmb_WMagIdM7l3R7jEUrhrCczf4E](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/BUB-x4wQX1GTKx_bmb_WMagIdM7l3R7jEUrhrCczf4E)\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/0wmMy0NQfH3btKsYRLeUgjtQvbhGHyRpukn0zuJ743U](https://mirror.xyz/0x90C6265b7499BAf2Bb2f882b6C04751C3dc6403a/0wmMy0NQfH3btKsYRLeUgjtQvbhGHyRpukn0zuJ743U)\n\n也可以来看看我的推特：

A total of 177,690 vsKSM ($439 million) and 3,045,564 vsDOT ($21 million) was minted through the protocol.\n\nThe SALP protocol works by releasing the liquidity of tokens staked during an auction; liquid derivatives such as vsDOT and vsKSM are issued on a 1:1 basis for the tokens staked. Both vsDOT and vsKSM can be used for decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications, and rewards throughout the ecosystem as long as the native tokens remain locked for the duration of the parachain lease.\n\nThis avoids the opportunity cost of locking their coins. However, the new SALP 2.0 allows users to obtain liquid tokens via direct investment, not just via crowdloan participation. Tyrone Pan, head of development at Bifrost, commented:\n\n> \"The upgrading of SALP 2.0 is generating a Bond market for Crowdloan assets, improving the efficiency of vsToken & vsBond liquidity while lowering the threshold for users. This model not only facilitates Crowdloan users to manage derivatives, but also cleverly combines Crowdloan with DeFi.\"\n\nLiquid staking is a [relatively new phenomenon](https://cointelegraph.com/news/we-ll-see-about-200-chains-connected-through-cosmos-ibc-next-year-says-tendermint-ceo-peng-zhong) in the DeFi realm, created primarily to allow users to recover potential opportunity costs while staking their assets.

On July 26-27, a decision will be made as to whether to hike interest rates further, while on July 28, the United States Q2 2022 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates will tell us whether the country is in a technical recession.\n\n### July 13: Inflation marker, CPI\n\nMichaël van de Poppe, CEO and founder of crypto consultancy and educational platform EightGlobal, told his 614,300 Twitter followers on Monday that it’s “all eyes on the CPI data next week,” adding bullish forecasts for Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) should it flip above its $20,000 price point.\n\nCo-founder of The Crypto Academy, known on Twitter as Wolves of Crypto, [told](https://twitter.com/WolvesofCrypto_/status/1543925027317633024) his followers to keep an eye out for the date, adding that CPI going lower than expected “could be the catalyst for a dead cat bounce” for Bitcoin:\n\n> “All eyes on CPI numbers on July 13th. If CPI comes in lower, that will be the catalyst for a dead cat bounce.”\n\nCPI is one of the benchmarks for gauging how inflation progresses by measuring the average change in consumer prices based on a representative basket of household goods and services.\n\nContinued rising inflation could impact demand for cryptocurrencies, with consumers needing to spend more to get by than before.\n\nInterestingly, while Bitcoin was created amid high inflation following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, and touted as an inflation hedge due to its fixed supply and scarcity, recent years have seen the cryptocurrency perform in line with traditional tech stocks, being [less than inflation-proof](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/bitcoin-and-inflation-everything-you-need-to-know).\n\nThe next scheduled release of the CPI is [expected](https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/cpi.htm) on July 13, 2022, by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAccording to Trading Economics, the current consensus on the June inflation rate, or CPI, is 8.7%, slightly higher than May’s 8.6%.\n\n### July 26-27: Fed interest rate hike\n\nAfter raising interest rates by 75 basis points in June, one of the most significant monthly increases in 28 years, interest rates are expected to increase further following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later this month.\n\nInterest rate hikes are one of the primary tools used by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Central Bank to manage inflation by slowing down the economy. Increased interest rates lead to increases in borrowing costs, which can discourage consumer and business spending and lending.\n\nIt can also place downward pressure on [higher-risk asset prices](https://cointelegraph.com/news/80-000-bitcoin-millionaires-wiped-out-in-the-great-crypto-crash-of-2022), such as crypto, as investors can start to earn decent returns just by parking their money in interest-bearing accounts or low-risk assets.\n\nThis month, the FOMC is expected to decide whether to impose a 50 or 75 basis point hike. Charlie Bilello, founder and CEO of Compound Capital Advisors, placed his bets on the higher amount.\n\n### July 28: Are we in a recession?\n\nOn July 28, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) will release an advance estimate of the United States’ GDP for the second quarter of 2022.\n\nAfter registering a -1.6% GDP decline in Q1 2022, Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow tracker is now expecting a -2.1% decline in GDP growth for Q2 2022.\n\nA second consecutive quarter of GDP decline would place the United States into a “technical recession.”\n\n***Related: [On the brink of recession: Can Bitcoin survive its first global economic crisis?](https://cointelegraph.com/news/on-the-brink-of-recession-can-bitcoin-survive-its-first-global-economic-crisis)***\n\nShould the United States economy be officially labeled as a recession, which is [expected to begin in 2023](https://cointelegraph.com/news/on-the-brink-of-recession-can-bitcoin-survive-its-first-global-economic-crisis), Bitcoin will be facing its first-ever full-blown recession and is likely to see a continued decline alongside tech stocks.\n\n### Silver lining?\n\nDespite the gloomy macro forecasts, some of crypto’s leading pundits view the recent macro-catalyzed crypto market crash as an overall positive sign for the industry.\n\nCrypto expert Erik Voorhees, co-founder of Coinapult and CEO and founder of ShapeShift, said the current crypto crash is “least worrisome” to him, as it is the first crypto crash to result from macro factors outside of crypto.\n\nAlliance DAO core contributor Qiao Wang made similar comments to his 131,200 followers, [noting](https://twitter.com/QwQiao/status/1543964998749257728) that this is the first cycle where the main bear case was an “exogenous factor:”\n\n> “People who are worried about crypto because of macro realize how bullish this is right?”\n\n“This is the first cycle where the main bear case is an exogenous factor. In previous cycles, it was endogenous, e.g., Mt.Gox (2014) and ICOs (2018),” he explained.", "timestamp": 1657011752, "digest": "JiuJKDS4XswIk0yrYOpfRU2WeifEhJaBwvcUHmwEKVg", "contributor": "0xF02716289b2036d51283B9baEc327355F27381F9"}
{"id": "UoC_tUIh6yTd00aVSr19teZK1EXQwpf8L_nmaran_xw", "title": "BTC Cycle – Formula Don’t Lie", "body": "**Research report – BTC market**\n\n*February 21, 2022*\n\n§  Bitcoin (“BTC”) is a Proof-of-Work blockchain that requires validators help validating transactions (hash functions) to support public ledger\n\n§  Validators compete computing power against others in the network for validating hashes, the validation process is called mining\n\n§  Validators are rewarded with BTC for validating the blocks, which is called block rewards\n\n§  Hash rate and halving are the key concepts that drive block rewards and block validation speed, which drives the BTC price\n\n§  Unlike other traditional commodities, BTC supply is determined by mathematical formula\n\n**Fundamentals that determine BTC Price – Hash Rate**\n\nThe fundamental element that drives BTC supply is the hash rate, which is related to the network difficulty (how difficult to validate the hash function). Network difficulty is directly correlated to the total hash rate according to the hash function formula, and the general principle is that the network difficulty gradually increases overtime. \n \n\n![Figure 1: BTC Total Hash Rate (TH/s)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uP8UZQvUr3n3mI16GLmob.png?height=347&width=852)\n\n![Figure 2: BTC Price (2012 – 2022)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jBnnh5OjFfWrlzCcLxfKo.png?height=328&width=824)\n\n**Fundamentals that determine BTC Price – Half-Life**\n\nApart from network difficulty, another key factor that drive BTC price is block reward. Half-life is a primary feature of BTC’s Proof-of-Work mechanism, where block rewards are halved every four years. This is a very important concept, and we will assess the impact of halving to BTC price in further details below.\n\n![Figure 3: BTC Half-life schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iCXll2_eDdd5Tc4-WQVce.png?height=115&width=368)\n\n **What shall we expect in and after Half-life**\n\nUnder BTC’s PoW mechanism, BTC would experience a half-life in 2024, meaning that miners’ block rewards would be halved to 3.125BTC per block (currently 6.25BTC).\n\nIt is interesting that BTC price has experienced a bull run at every “Halving Cycles”. The bull run in 2012 lasted for 372 days, BTC price surged from US$15 to US$512 (peaked at US$1,217), while 2016’s bull run lasted 526 days, the price jumped from US$647 to US$3,276 (peaked at US$19,800). In latest 2020 halving, BTC price also surged from $8,787 to $50,000 (peaked at $67,000).\n\nThe bull run could be explained by price discovery by the market on BTC’s scarcity. We observe that BTC price fits closest to the stock-to-flow model at year of half-life and after.\n\n**Where we are currently**\n\nThe market demand for BTC is currently very low, and it can be demonstrated from AAVE[\\[2\\]](#_ftn2) and Curve’s funding rate. We can understand AAVE and Curve funding rate as the risk-free rate in the crypto world. The funding rate is driven by the propensity to borrow and lend in the market.\n\nWith only 2.7% of the BTC pool being utilized, we think that the current BTC market is currently underwhelmed.

That’s long gone and now it is just me posting here with some chatter occasionally on Twitter.\n\nAs anyone who has tried knows, posting every day is a mighty big commitment. I am relieved to have given that up, gradually, a few years ago.\n\nWhat is left at AVC is a place where I can write when I have something to say that I want to say out loud.

She prepares me for my return; places single, white blossoms across the forehead of my Heart, above my crown. Protecting me and reminding me that I am eternally supported. That I am not only loved but that I **am** Love; that Love is all that I Am. She gently takes my hand and places it in my own. Where I am going, I must carry myself, she says. Where we are headed, the path is clear but still unknown. Its clarity lies in its clairvoyance; its whisper of eternity; its tender promise of eternity rooted in intimate trust; its vast picture of eternity planted inside of my mind, that I already knew what the pathway to infinity looks like, mapped out and ready for me to take my place as I settle in to a seat of surrender, a corner of curiosity, to turn on the tap and let the water flow effortlessly. To watch the hand of the Universe pull me in and install me with knowledge past, ancient wisdom and free me of fleeting temperance. To show me a new door, to a Now which looks nothing like the one I see before me, yet which feels strangely familiar in its welcoming acceptance. For me, as I am. For all that is, as it is. Here, I not only wait, but I choose. I choose my guidance as another me chooses the door in-front, behind, in the far left corner. I choose my experience and it enlightens my view. Shows me possibility and I lean farther into capability. When my inner child comes to play with me, I will tell her that she is safe. I will assure her inconsolable heart that she is deserving of receiving all that she gives. When she steps cautiously into my dreams, I will invite her lovingly to make her own choices. I will tell her that I could see her trepidation. For I, too, was peeking from behind the curtain to watch her imagination bloom. And, as in her wonder-filled eyes, I could see it in my own. I could feel the sparkle that I saw light up her path; could smell the petals she laid before her as stepping-stones into her truth, closer to me. Could sense the anguish which she asked with lightness, a playfulness unique to who she is, yet one that hides a plethora of angst. But she is the one who can turn fear into curiosity; is the one who can give love when she feels closed in. She is the silhouette who can come out of her own shadow when she creates from her Spark, when she steps in to her own, shapeshifting mould, when she hugs her bears tightly because it brings her closer with herself. \n\nI love her, so deeply.  \n I see her now, within me. \n Come forth, sweet one.

Network difficulty is directly correlated to the total hash rate according to the hash function formula, and the general principle is that the network difficulty gradually increases overtime. \n \n\n![Figure 1: BTC Total Hash Rate (TH/s)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uP8UZQvUr3n3mI16GLmob.png?height=347&width=852)\n\n![Figure 2: BTC Price (2012 – 2022)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jBnnh5OjFfWrlzCcLxfKo.png?height=328&width=824)\n\n**Fundamentals that determine BTC Price – Half-Life**\n\nApart from network difficulty, another key factor that drive BTC price is block reward. Half-life is a primary feature of BTC’s Proof-of-Work mechanism, where block rewards are halved every four years. This is a very important concept, and we will assess the impact of halving to BTC price in further details below.\n\n![Figure 3: BTC Half-life schedule](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iCXll2_eDdd5Tc4-WQVce.png?height=115&width=368)\n\n **What shall we expect in and after Half-life**\n\nUnder BTC’s PoW mechanism, BTC would experience a half-life in 2024, meaning that miners’ block rewards would be halved to 3.125BTC per block (currently 6.25BTC).\n\nIt is interesting that BTC price has experienced a bull run at every “Halving Cycles”. The bull run in 2012 lasted for 372 days, BTC price surged from US$15 to US$512 (peaked at US$1,217), while 2016’s bull run lasted 526 days, the price jumped from US$647 to US$3,276 (peaked at US$19,800). In latest 2020 halving, BTC price also surged from $8,787 to $50,000 (peaked at $67,000).\n\nThe bull run could be explained by price discovery by the market on BTC’s scarcity. We observe that BTC price fits closest to the stock-to-flow model at year of half-life and after.\n\n**Where we are currently**\n\nThe market demand for BTC is currently very low, and it can be demonstrated from AAVE[\\[2\\]](#_ftn2) and Curve’s funding rate. We can understand AAVE and Curve funding rate as the risk-free rate in the crypto world. The funding rate is driven by the propensity to borrow and lend in the market.\n\nWith only 2.7% of the BTC pool being utilized, we think that the current BTC market is currently underwhelmed. This is largely due to its non-interoperability with other chains, compared to USDT[\\[3\\]](#_ftn3) and DAI. The current funding rate of USDT and DAI are 1.97% and 2.25%, meaning that market is more attracted to holding and lending stable coin.\n\n![AAVE FUNDING RATE](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m--SywZt0ydBWbKN765RQ.png?height=335&width=667)\n\n![CURVE POOL BTC STAKING YIELD](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vftiRJypKbDZe8ptX3cx8.png?height=524&width=685)\n\n*\\*Data extracted as of 21st February 2022*\n\n \n\n**Halve life pattern – Formula don’t lie**\n\nBased on our fundamental analysis on BTC half life, I reckon that the earliest bull run shall come in early 2024. Another observation is that BTC market share falls gradually to less than 30%.

{"id": "vULgXF3gaHkmlB5aCVQJVCaV8TDZmfp9PVEMfhkQr2A", "title": "NFT亏了，但我可以授权做IP啊", "body": "最近几条关于NFT IP授权的新闻扎堆出现，让很多人终于开始关注这一赛道。在这几天，有的无聊猿被挂到“人才市场”，有的无聊猿则穿上了新的系列套装。这些让人眼前一亮的新尝试在如今的Crypto寒冬中格外难能可贵，似乎也在昭示着，熊市中，人们逐渐从对于NFT赛道中各类Infura（基建）项目近乎迷信的关注，转变成了对于NFT品牌价值的发掘。\n\n诚然，Infura是底层基础，似乎是所有项目的“必经之路”，但说到底Infura比的是市占率，而关于市占率，在无比崇尚正统性的Crypto世界中，若非出现重大漏洞，先发优势似乎是无解的，不然OpenSea的日子也不会如此悠哉。\n\nCrypto的进步依赖于技术的发展，而Web3走向主流需要的是不断破圈。\n\n# NFT：从艺术到品牌\n\n让我们先回过头看看人们对NFT的认知是如何发展成“品牌”的。\n\n让我们先从公认的最早的“NFT”项目——CryptoPunks说起（虽然现在也有很多项目被发现比CryptoPunks更早诞生）。\n\n尽管现在余文乐把CryptoPunk当作Logo因在自己的衣服上，Tiffany也做了CryptoPunk形象的首饰，但在最初，Larva Labs把它定位成了一个向密码朋克致敬的艺术项目，两个开发者也多了“艺术家”这一身份。\n\n再之后虽然也有不少游戏类的DApp使用NFT技术承载游戏内资产，如虚拟宠物、游戏道具、交易卡等，而让NFT第一次大规模出圈的是Beeple的NFT艺术品在佳士得拍出了6900万美金的天价。在Hackatao、XCOPY、Coldie、Alotta Money等NFT艺术家多年的推动下，NFT在艺术领域迎来了爆发。而在那时，人们对于NFT的关注和人们对于所有新事物的关注一样停留在了底层技术层面，人们关注区块链技术如何帮助数字艺术确权，关注数字艺术在哪里才能真正永存，关注区块链技术如何让艺术变得“可编程”、“可互动”。\n\n随着时间推移，人们理解中的NFT从艺术品变成了“社交资本”，拜大规模出现的头像NFT所赐。这一趋势其实从HashMasks就能窥探一二，不过可惜的是HashMasks过于追求艺术性，却忽视了作为社交资本时更为重要的区分度与传播性。\n\n而在那时，人们似乎还没有“品牌”的概念，回过头看关于BAYC早期的文章，大多数在聊的也是持有一只无聊猿就能够加入“Yacht Club”，成为这个社交圈的一员，不仅推特上会有一堆无聊猿关注你，甚至像库里、Snoop Dogg、周杰伦都是这个圈子里的。似乎只要你持有一只无聊猿就能与他们产生联系，而这些名人、大佬的选择也像是给BAYC印上了认证戳。\n\n到如今，仍然有数不清的项目以“艺术”或“社交圈”为核心发行着NFT系列。艺术项目的核心是艺术家，而往往艺术家不会做运营；社交圈项目的冷启动往往依赖于某个名人的站台，让大家以为持有这个NFT就能认识到这些名人，但如何让这些名人长期在社区活跃是一个难以解决的问题。\n\n而让我们再来看看如今发展得还不错的项目，比如BAYC、Azuki、Doodles、RTFKT，我们会发现，在他们的崛起阶段都在做品牌。\n\n“做品牌”这个事情听起来挺虚的，让我们换个词：建设社区。建设社区是通过组织各种活动让社区成员对于项目产生更深刻的认知。而“品牌”在百度百科中的解释就是：消费者对某类产品及产品系列的认知程度。\n\n在Web2，品牌诞生自公司内部的决策，然后再按图索骥搜寻用户。而在Web3，品牌诞生自社区，项目方可以预设一个大方向，但关于项目共识、认知的细节则是在社区形成的过程中动态调整的，这样形成的品牌才是自下而上的，才是Web3品牌，而不是一个套着壳子的Web2品牌。\n\n从最开始对艺术的极致追求，到中期的对艺术性的放弃，再到现在人们认识到PFP形象对于品牌形成冷启动阶段的重要作用，NFT也完成了从艺术品到艺术消费品的蜕变。\n\n# Web3的品牌是宗教\n\n关于无聊猿的Otherside，在最近的评价越来越趋于一致，越来越多人认为BAYC往游戏赛道发展并不是一个最佳选择，面前明明摆着一条能够更出圈、获得更大影响力的道路，Yuga Labs却选择回到Gamefi这个相对狭小且凶险的圈子。\n\n不过话虽如此，但以无聊猿如今的体量来说，也许可以做到同时走好几条路，和Animoca做游戏，和滚石发展品牌，并不冲突。但是，对于更多项目而言，只能选其中的一条路走。\n\n艺术太小众，Gamefi太凶险，社交太务虚……\n\n不如好好做品牌。\n\n上文提到，在Web3，做品牌就是建设社区，认知与共识凝结起来后再做产品。相比于Web2通过一件件产品来博取用户的信任，对于Web3项目来说，“人”才是最宝贵的财富。面对Web3世界，庞大且坚实的社区是项目安身立命之本，能够更容易地抓住人们的注意力，并创造出更大的声浪；而面对Web2世界，这也是最能吸引传统品牌的原因。\n\n一个NFT项目的持有者人数有几千人，社区有上万人，把这个数量按照Web2世界中传统品牌的转化率计算，能量与一个数百万甚至上千万关注者的品牌相当，更重要的是这群人还不是四散在各处，他们彼此之间还有极强的链接，这已经不仅仅是品牌与粉丝的关系了。\n\n这是宗教。\n\n当你拥有了这样一群坚定且能动的支持者，建立在这个共识之上去做任何产品都是合理的，而且很多情况下根本不需要你自己去做，会有知名服装品牌主动联名，会有游戏开发商主动将品牌接入游戏中，会有音乐人主动创作歌曲，会有影视公司主动创作影视作品。品牌的影响力会迎来指数级的爆发增长，而影响力的持续扩大又会带来更强大的效应与共识。\n\n# NFT IP授权\n\nWeb3品牌欢迎社区成员主动传播，所以很多项目采用CC0协议或者是将NFT的版权授予持有者，如此一来，持有者以及品牌的支持者便有权利去做任何衍生品，比如上文提到的服装、游戏、歌曲、影视。\n\n不过，长时间观察下来，用IP做周边、授权的似乎也只有极少数人。这其实很正常，对于大多数Holder而言，很难凭借自己的力量对接到Web2品牌方、供应链、影视公司等等，而且即便是能对接到，繁杂的法律文件等也不是谁都能处理得过来的。也正是把握住了这一痛点，现在逐渐开始有做NFT IP授权的项目走上了舞台。做IP授权不仅仅能让项目本身获得更高的知名度，也能让持有者、项目方获得更多的收入，继续投身到品牌建设之中。\n\n不过这条路并不好走。\n\n最基础的是法律问题。Web3的版权、所有权问题很好解决，看链上数据就可以了，但是一旦涉及到与Web2结合，事情就会变得无比复杂。很多Web3项目没有注册版权，很多Crypto Native的团队甚至不屑于注册版权，但很多Web2公司在签署IP授权协议时必须要求提交版权证明文件。\n\n而即使是注册了版权文件，“Holder拥有所持有的NFT的版权”这件事要如何实现呢？每一笔交易流转都签署一份版权转让协议显然是无法实现的，版权证明文件要么没有，要么被项目方拿在手里。而你也不能要求Web2的大公司去“相信”项目方不会“作恶”，信任成本和法律程序会阻碍落地过程。\n\n站在Holder角度考虑，未来可能会面对众多NFT IP授权平台，我们应该如何挑选呢？举例来说，Boredjobs的确拿到了一些无聊猿的授权，不过这也只是整个流程其中最好实现的步骤。作为Web3圈内人，认识各种NFT的Holder是很简单的事情，从他们手中要到授权也是很简单的，毕竟只需要签一份协议就有机会让“我的猴子替我赚钱”。\n\n真正的难点是上面提到的大部分Holder做不到的事情，拿到12个无聊猿的授权很容易，联系到泡泡玛特并让泡泡玛特用这12只无聊猿的形象生产销售一套盲盒很难。\n\nNFT IP授权开始被人重视，这也许就意味着NFT2.0时代的到来。很多人会认为NFT2.0指的是未来在技术方向进行更深度的拓展，而NFT横向发展、不断拓宽影响力的边界也一定会是大势所趋。技术的进步会让整个领域的下限不断提高，而在这个技术微创新不断、缺少大创新的领域，品牌才是将天花板不断抬高的最佳方式。", "timestamp": 1657014605, "digest": "h_rxfORrmqXfBLmpWpoIZfBv_aRTALWFOcoqZiMaRm0", "contributor": "0x429f13e4ec5E57c9AE2388c5020E372F73fe168A"}

On July 26-27, a decision will be made as to whether to hike interest rates further, while on July 28, the United States Q2 2022 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates will tell us whether the country is in a technical recession.\n\n### July 13: Inflation marker, CPI\n\nMichaël van de Poppe, CEO and founder of crypto consultancy and educational platform EightGlobal, told his 614,300 Twitter followers on Monday that it’s “all eyes on the CPI data next week,” adding bullish forecasts for Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) should it flip above its $20,000 price point.\n\nCo-founder of The Crypto Academy, known on Twitter as Wolves of Crypto, [told](https://twitter.com/WolvesofCrypto_/status/1543925027317633024) his followers to keep an eye out for the date, adding that CPI going lower than expected “could be the catalyst for a dead cat bounce” for Bitcoin:\n\n> “All eyes on CPI numbers on July 13th.

A total of 177,690 vsKSM ($439 million) and 3,045,564 vsDOT ($21 million) was minted through the protocol.\n\nThe SALP protocol works by releasing the liquidity of tokens staked during an auction; liquid derivatives such as vsDOT and vsKSM are issued on a 1:1 basis for the tokens staked. Both vsDOT and vsKSM can be used for decentralized finance, or DeFi, applications, and rewards throughout the ecosystem as long as the native tokens remain locked for the duration of the parachain lease.\n\nThis avoids the opportunity cost of locking their coins. However, the new SALP 2.0 allows users to obtain liquid tokens via direct investment, not just via crowdloan participation. Tyrone Pan, head of development at Bifrost, commented:\n\n> \"The upgrading of SALP 2.0 is generating a Bond market for Crowdloan assets, improving the efficiency of vsToken & vsBond liquidity while lowering the threshold for users. This model not only facilitates Crowdloan users to manage derivatives, but also cleverly combines Crowdloan with DeFi.\"\n\nLiquid staking is a [relatively new phenomenon](https://cointelegraph.com/news/we-ll-see-about-200-chains-connected-through-cosmos-ibc-next-year-says-tendermint-ceo-peng-zhong) in the DeFi realm, created primarily to allow users to recover potential opportunity costs while staking their assets. The potential downside is their vulnerability to the changes in underlying assets as they are classified as DeFi derivatives. ", "timestamp": 1657011934, "digest": "QBpwOfsWwf5iH7ZjPblD2tSYBwpef6XoIyyob4iZzd4", "contributor": "0x5419AEF6D232A2168bEa5d9418C86493990c81e1"}

{"id": "x1phHxPnvGlkakdrzA9BufStbqNcFAbgnL4TyEn55TM", "title": "Learn Python Programming", "body": "Python is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is used in web development, data science, creating software prototypes, and so on. Fortunately for beginners, Python has simple easy-to-use syntax. This makes Python an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o5JCmg7JYZq0YaC33qXg0.png?height=420&width=1000)\n\nPython is a cross-platform programming language, which means that it can run on multiple platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, and has even been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines. It is free and open-source.\n\nEven though most of today's Linux and Mac have Python pre-installed in it, the version might be out-of-date. So, it is always a good idea to install the most current version. \n  \n The Easiest Way to Run Python\n\nThe easiest way to run Python is by using **Thonny IDE**.\n\nThe Thonny IDE comes with the latest version of Python bundled in it. So you don't have to install Python separately.\n\nFollow the following steps to run Python on your computer.\n\n1. Download [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/).\n2. Run the installer to install **Thonny** on your computer.\n3. Go to: **File** > **New**. Then save the file with `.py` extension. For example, `hello.py`, `example.py`, etc. \n You can give any name to the file. However, the file name should end with **.py**\n4. Write Python code in the file and save it. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2ir2MtjuRVSaCs9UY4T7L.png?height=483&width=805)\n\n* Then Go to **Run** > **Run current script** or simply click **F5** to run it. \n  \n **Install Python Separately**\n\n  If you don't want to use Thonny, here's how you can install and run Python on your computer.\n  1. Download the [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n  2. Run the installer file and follow the steps to install Python \n During the install process, check **Add Python to environment variables**. This will add Python to environment variables, and you can run Python from any part of the computer. \n  \n Also, you can choose the path where Python is installed. \n  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JRcQ0ZaHumsDM8aRPsZLC.png?height=340&width=550)\n\nOnce you finish the installation process, you can run Python.\n\n## 1. Run Python in Immediate mode\n\n \n Once Python is installed, typing `python` in the command line will invoke the interpreter in immediate mode. We can directly type in Python code, and press Enter to get the output.\n\nTry typing in `1 + 1` and press enter. We get `2` as the output. This prompt can be used as a calculator. To exit this mode, type `quit()` and press enter. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XP_2xZyKDMHhuhtMuRXTl.png?height=254&width=668)\n\n### 2. Run Python in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n\nWe can use any text editing software to write a Python script file.\n\nWe just need to save it with the `.py` extension. But using an IDE can make our life a lot easier. IDE is a piece of software that provides useful features like code hinting, syntax highlighting and checking, file explorers, etc. to the programmer for application development.\n\nBy the way, when you install Python, an IDE named **IDLE** is also installed. You can use it to run Python on your computer. It's a decent IDE for beginners.\n\nWhen you open IDLE, an interactive Python Shell is opened. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/N_NQnUzjCR713d10Ufba7.png?height=328&width=624)\n\nNow you can create a new file and save it with **.py** extension. For example, **hello.py**\n\nWrite Python code in the file and save it. To run the file, go to **Run** > **Run Module** or simply click **F5**. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bOTCya_ibYVtpA0K3EkO4.png?height=527&width=844)\n\n## Your first Python Program\n\nNow that we have Python up and running, we can write our first Python program.\n\nLet's create a very simple program called `Hello World`. A **\"Hello, World!\"** is a simple program that outputs `Hello, World!` on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, it's often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners.\n\nType the following code in any text editor or an IDE and save it as `hello_world.py` \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FgJSJ5rhnaU3KgRm5fmmK.png?height=83&width=684)\n\nThen, run the file. You will get the following output. \n  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FNBrXEpZ_VV0-y2wUprh_.png?height=41&width=713)\n\nCongratulations! You just wrote your first program in Python.\n\nAs you can see, this was a pretty easy task. This is the beauty of the Python programming language. \n  \n Would you like to learn more?

H20 Securities aims to bring more significant development in water infrastructure worldwide and hopes that its solution will increase water availability to the world’s population.\n\nIn a joint [announcement](https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/crypto-water-token-world-first-launched-by-south-africa-based-h2o-water-securities-which-received-150m-investment-from-gem-14024612.htm) on July 4, CEO of H20 Securities Julius Steyn said, “The focus with the H2ON token is mainly on the financing of water projects internationally and not so much on the technical engineering and construction of such projects.”\n\nGEM Digital is no stranger to investing in technologies designed to improve environmental effects and living conditions for humanity. Its [portfolio](https://www.gemny.com/portfolio/recent-control-investments/) includes investments in Changing World Technologies, a food waste processing firm, and Neos Ocular, a firm that produces lasers to improve vision.\n\nGEM previously invested in the digital asset management service QBNK Holding AB.\n\nH20N will be used to settle bills between H20N network participants, including water plant operators and their clients.

Maybe it is not even possible to do that. Maybe “trustless” just means “as little trust put into a stranger as possible”. Let’s explore.\n\nBlockchain and web3 (or web5, or web42) promise a trustless environment. Ecosystem where you do not need to trust third parties to manage your funds, to gate access to your belongings, to make sure your “good” is taken care of.\n\nMost often this is a trap - what does it even mean “trustless”? \n\n[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trustless) says **trustless** means “*not deserving of trust*”. That is exactly the opposite of what web3, crypto and blockchain promise, right?\n\nI believe we cannot get rid of trust. Someone recently told me, while we were arguing about whether crypto & web3 makes any sense, that “*people require an authority to look up to and obey*”. I think he was not wrong. I believe there is something in our psyche which longs for being able to offload the decisions, to get rid of responsibility, to delegate the worries. Even when you look at our governments - we have elections, we may claim to vote for ther “experts” and those “fit” to lead the country, but all the majority really wants, is to be able to **trust** the leaders that they will do the right thing on behalf of citizens.\n\nSo why does this web3, crypto and blockchain world keep talking about trust like it is something bad?\n\nIn my opinion it is about “who” or “what” do you trust. Nothing in web3 is trustless. If we go from the top, \n\n1. You need to trust the website developer to do everything right, so that you don’t interact with a wrong/malicious contract and lose money.\n2. You need to trust the smart contract developers to not steal your money once you transfer them into the contract (and yes, you can review the code, but audits are hard and often not perfect, so even experts miss potential holes).\n3. You need to trust the miners/validators that they will not stop the chain from running altogether.\n\nI believe we should not strive for trustlessness, but for **openness** and **provability**. We will always need to put trust in others, but public blockchain and web3 layers allow us to build a different type of social graph which shows if someone who is giving us an advice actually is trustworthy.\n\nWe should be able to find a way to see if and auditor is trustful or trustless based on how many projects rugged after their audit.\n\nWe should be able to get reviews and recommendations by other members of community for what we did and then use those reviews as [claims](https://katelynsills.com/blockchain/soulbound-tokens/) when we want or need to prove ourselves to show we are trustful.\n\nWe no longer live in small communities where your mother knows all the neigbours and can tell you who to trust. We live in a global world where trust is also a global commodity. We need to find ways how to capture the trust put into us by others to be able to use it when someone is not sure whether to trust us or not.\n\nI believe this is where open public blockchains and web3 approaches can help us a lot.", "timestamp": 1657031754, "digest": "mRQrZsD6h9sc1hLm1znoXw_zfRorkMtwXC8cvP1xw8g", "contributor": "0x1D45c8fa65F6b18E7dAe04b2efEa332c55696DaA"}

She prepares me for my return; places single, white blossoms across the forehead of my Heart, above my crown. Protecting me and reminding me that I am eternally supported. That I am not only loved but that I **am** Love; that Love is all that I Am. She gently takes my hand and places it in my own. Where I am going, I must carry myself, she says. Where we are headed, the path is clear but still unknown. Its clarity lies in its clairvoyance; its whisper of eternity; its tender promise of eternity rooted in intimate trust; its vast picture of eternity planted inside of my mind, that I already knew what the pathway to infinity looks like, mapped out and ready for me to take my place as I settle in to a seat of surrender, a corner of curiosity, to turn on the tap and let the water flow effortlessly. To watch the hand of the Universe pull me in and install me with knowledge past, ancient wisdom and free me of fleeting temperance. To show me a new door, to a Now which looks nothing like the one I see before me, yet which feels strangely familiar in its welcoming acceptance. For me, as I am. For all that is, as it is. Here, I not only wait, but I choose. I choose my guidance as another me chooses the door in-front, behind, in the far left corner. I choose my experience and it enlightens my view. Shows me possibility and I lean farther into capability. When my inner child comes to play with me, I will tell her that she is safe. I will assure her inconsolable heart that she is deserving of receiving all that she gives. When she steps cautiously into my dreams, I will invite her lovingly to make her own choices. I will tell her that I could see her trepidation. For I, too, was peeking from behind the curtain to watch her imagination bloom. And, as in her wonder-filled eyes, I could see it in my own. I could feel the sparkle that I saw light up her path; could smell the petals she laid before her as stepping-stones into her truth, closer to me. Could sense the anguish which she asked with lightness, a playfulness unique to who she is, yet one that hides a plethora of angst. But she is the one who can turn fear into curiosity; is the one who can give love when she feels closed in. She is the silhouette who can come out of her own shadow when she creates from her Spark, when she steps in to her own, shapeshifting mould, when she hugs her bears tightly because it brings her closer with herself. \n\nI love her, so deeply.  \n I see her now, within me. \n Come forth, sweet one.

I admire the work of military strategists, intelligence officials, and governments who have stepped into supplying the needed hardware. Most of all I admire the brave men and women of the Ukrainian military who make the ultimate sacrifice daily. But we can never lose sight of the larger purpose and the higher ground. Ultimately this is about peace, liberty, and justice. \n\nEisenhower warned of the “military-industrial complex.” He was talking about the people who made trillions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those same people see a trillion-dollar opportunity in Ukraine, which can not be. The political leadership can not outsource the war to that “military-industrial complex.” Because that would be to lose sight of the primary goal of this unfortunate war. \n\nThe sole focus can not be to outgun Putin. To try would be to fall into his trap. That is what he wants. That is what he understands. Perhaps Putin and Zelensky are not talking, but plenty of people are talking to Putin and should keep on talking. All global players who have Putin’s ears should step in and play a role to help deescalate. This war is already global. Look at the food crisis in Africa. \n\nAll countries directly impacted by the blockage of Ukraine’s wheat by Putin’s mines in the Black Sea should ramp up the pressure on Putin. This war is not about Donbas. This is about Putin wanting to stay in power for 20 more years. A dictator needs his wars for domestic reasons. \n\nScotland has the democratic right and option to break away from Britain. Ukraine should be willing to say it is ready for such an eventuality for Crimea and Donbas. That Russia might not reciprocate is not an issue. Russia is not a democracy. Ukraine is. This offer should be relentlessly made through all available channels. Conquest can not be allowed. But the people of Crimea and Donbas can, in an internationally organized referendum, choose to do the Scotland and Quebec thing. That should be Ukraine’s stand. The stand is the political option to push the Russian military out. There you up the pressure as much as possible. And that political campaign also weakens Putin militarily. Why do you want to go down the path of death and destruction when you can easily have the same through a referendum? People in his own camp will ask. And no matter how the Russian military steps out, that weakens the Putin regime in Moscow. The strongman starts looking like a strawman. The madman starts looking like the madman he is. And despite the referendum carrot, if he does not step back, that saps the morale of the Russian forces. That also weakens him militarily. A military defeat of Putin in Donbas becomes much more possible after you hit on the head relentlessly with this political solution. \n\nThe political solution has to be primary. The economic sanctions are secondary. The military solution has to be tertiary. \n\n![](https://www.history.com/.image/t_share/MTYyODEwNTIzMDQ4NTUyMDI0/general-eisenhower-gettyimages-107758850.jpg)\n\n[crowdfund://0x4C2380d1548bbf533F0336225Bb9A7784BCDF2f8?features=overview,editions,podium,backers](crowdfund://0x4C2380d1548bbf533F0336225Bb9A7784BCDF2f8?features=overview,editions,podium,backers)\n\n", "timestamp": 1656256677, "digest": "Qf7igYYqjAli56jtIIYW-e3g8shDVvpe5xU2_rKo_cY", "contributor": "0x065e533120b87e5b4F5bfBF0802EB6428c237487"}

If CPI comes in lower, that will be the catalyst for a dead cat bounce.”\n\nCPI is one of the benchmarks for gauging how inflation progresses by measuring the average change in consumer prices based on a representative basket of household goods and services.\n\nContinued rising inflation could impact demand for cryptocurrencies, with consumers needing to spend more to get by than before.\n\nInterestingly, while Bitcoin was created amid high inflation following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, and touted as an inflation hedge due to its fixed supply and scarcity, recent years have seen the cryptocurrency perform in line with traditional tech stocks, being [less than inflation-proof](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/bitcoin-and-inflation-everything-you-need-to-know).\n\nThe next scheduled release of the CPI is [expected](https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/cpi.htm) on July 13, 2022, by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAccording to Trading Economics, the current consensus on the June inflation rate, or CPI, is 8.7%, slightly higher than May’s 8.6%.\n\n### July 26-27: Fed interest rate hike\n\nAfter raising interest rates by 75 basis points in June, one of the most significant monthly increases in 28 years, interest rates are expected to increase further following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later this month.\n\nInterest rate hikes are one of the primary tools used by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Central Bank to manage inflation by slowing down the economy. Increased interest rates lead to increases in borrowing costs, which can discourage consumer and business spending and lending.\n\nIt can also place downward pressure on [higher-risk asset prices](https://cointelegraph.com/news/80-000-bitcoin-millionaires-wiped-out-in-the-great-crypto-crash-of-2022), such as crypto, as investors can start to earn decent returns just by parking their money in interest-bearing accounts or low-risk assets.\n\nThis month, the FOMC is expected to decide whether to impose a 50 or 75 basis point hike. Charlie Bilello, founder and CEO of Compound Capital Advisors, placed his bets on the higher amount.\n\n### July 28: Are we in a recession?\n\nOn July 28, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) will release an advance estimate of the United States’ GDP for the second quarter of 2022.\n\nAfter registering a -1.6% GDP decline in Q1 2022, Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow tracker is now expecting a -2.1% decline in GDP growth for Q2 2022.\n\nA second consecutive quarter of GDP decline would place the United States into a “technical recession.”\n\n***Related: [On the brink of recession: Can Bitcoin survive its first global economic crisis?](https://cointelegraph.com/news/on-the-brink-of-recession-can-bitcoin-survive-its-first-global-economic-crisis)***\n\nShould the United States economy be officially labeled as a recession, which is [expected to begin in 2023](https://cointelegraph.com/news/on-the-brink-of-recession-can-bitcoin-survive-its-first-global-economic-crisis), Bitcoin will be facing its first-ever full-blown recession and is likely to see a continued decline alongside tech stocks.\n\n### Silver lining?\n\nDespite the gloomy macro forecasts, some of crypto’s leading pundits view the recent macro-catalyzed crypto market crash as an overall positive sign for the industry.\n\nCrypto expert Erik Voorhees, co-founder of Coinapult and CEO and founder of ShapeShift, said the current crypto crash is “least worrisome” to him, as it is the first crypto crash to result from macro factors outside of crypto.\n\nAlliance DAO core contributor Qiao Wang made similar comments to his 131,200 followers, [noting](https://twitter.com/QwQiao/status/1543964998749257728) that this is the first cycle where the main bear case was an “exogenous factor:”\n\n> “People who are worried about crypto because of macro realize how bullish this is right?”\n\n“This is the first cycle where the main bear case is an exogenous factor. In previous cycles, it was endogenous, e.g., Mt.Gox (2014) and ICOs (2018),” he explained.", "timestamp": 1657011752, "digest": "JiuJKDS4XswIk0yrYOpfRU2WeifEhJaBwvcUHmwEKVg", "contributor": "0xF02716289b2036d51283B9baEc327355F27381F9"}

She prepares me for my return; places single, white blossoms across the forehead of my Heart, above my crown. Protecting me and reminding me that I am eternally supported. That I am not only loved but that I **am** Love; that Love is all that I Am. She gently takes my hand and places it in my own. Where I am going, I must carry myself, she says. Where we are headed, the path is clear but still unknown. Its clarity lies in its clairvoyance; its whisper of eternity; its tender promise of eternity rooted in intimate trust; its vast picture of eternity planted inside of my mind, that I already knew what the pathway to infinity looks like, mapped out and ready for me to take my place as I settle in to a seat of surrender, a corner of curiosity, to turn on the tap and let the water flow effortlessly. To watch the hand of the Universe pull me in and install me with knowledge past, ancient wisdom and free me of fleeting temperance. To show me a new door, to a Now which looks nothing like the one I see before me, yet which feels strangely familiar in its welcoming acceptance. For me, as I am. For all that is, as it is. Here, I not only wait, but I choose. I choose my guidance as another me chooses the door in-front, behind, in the far left corner. I choose my experience and it enlightens my view. Shows me possibility and I lean farther into capability. When my inner child comes to play with me, I will tell her that she is safe. I will assure her inconsolable heart that she is deserving of receiving all that she gives. When she steps cautiously into my dreams, I will invite her lovingly to make her own choices. I will tell her that I could see her trepidation. For I, too, was peeking from behind the curtain to watch her imagination bloom. And, as in her wonder-filled eyes, I could see it in my own. I could feel the sparkle that I saw light up her path; could smell the petals she laid before her as stepping-stones into her truth, closer to me. Could sense the anguish which she asked with lightness, a playfulness unique to who she is, yet one that hides a plethora of angst. But she is the one who can turn fear into curiosity; is the one who can give love when she feels closed in. She is the silhouette who can come out of her own shadow when she creates from her Spark, when she steps in to her own, shapeshifting mould, when she hugs her bears tightly because it brings her closer with herself. \n\nI love her, so deeply.  \n I see her now, within me. \n Come forth, sweet one.

She prepares me for my return; places single, white blossoms across the forehead of my Heart, above my crown. Protecting me and reminding me that I am eternally supported. That I am not only loved but that I **am** Love; that Love is all that I Am. She gently takes my hand and places it in my own. Where I am going, I must carry myself, she says. Where we are headed, the path is clear but still unknown. Its clarity lies in its clairvoyance; its whisper of eternity; its tender promise of eternity rooted in intimate trust; its vast picture of eternity planted inside of my mind, that I already knew what the pathway to infinity looks like, mapped out and ready for me to take my place as I settle in to a seat of surrender, a corner of curiosity, to turn on the tap and let the water flow effortlessly. To watch the hand of the Universe pull me in and install me with knowledge past, ancient wisdom and free me of fleeting temperance. To show me a new door, to a Now which looks nothing like the one I see before me, yet which feels strangely familiar in its welcoming acceptance. For me, as I am. For all that is, as it is. Here, I not only wait, but I choose. I choose my guidance as another me chooses the door in-front, behind, in the far left corner. I choose my experience and it enlightens my view. Shows me possibility and I lean farther into capability. When my inner child comes to play with me, I will tell her that she is safe. I will assure her inconsolable heart that she is deserving of receiving all that she gives. When she steps cautiously into my dreams, I will invite her lovingly to make her own choices. I will tell her that I could see her trepidation. For I, too, was peeking from behind the curtain to watch her imagination bloom. And, as in her wonder-filled eyes, I could see it in my own. I could feel the sparkle that I saw light up her path; could smell the petals she laid before her as stepping-stones into her truth, closer to me. Could sense the anguish which she asked with lightness, a playfulness unique to who she is, yet one that hides a plethora of angst. But she is the one who can turn fear into curiosity; is the one who can give love when she feels closed in.

He was the brother of an important royal official, [William de Chesney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_de_Chesney), and the uncle of [Gilbert Foliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Foliot), successively [Bishop of Hereford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Hereford) and [Bishop of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_London). Educated at Oxford or Paris, Chesney was [Archdeacon of Leicester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Leicester) before his election as bishop in December 1148.\n\nChesney served as a [royal justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_justice) in Lincolnshire during his bishopric, and maintained a close relationship with his nephew, Foliot. He was also an early patron of [Thomas Becket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Becket), and gave the young cleric an office in his diocese early in Becket's career. Although shown favour by [King Stephen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_of_England), including the right to a [mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_(facility)), Chesney was present at the coronation of [King Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England) in 1154 and went on to serve Henry as a royal justice. Around 1160, Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with [St Albans Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans_Abbey) in the diocese of Lincoln, over his right as bishop to supervise the abbey. The dispute was eventually settled when the abbey granted Chesney land in return for his relinquishing any right to oversee St Albans.\n\nChesney was active in his diocese; more than 240 documents relating to his episcopal career survive. They show him mediating disputes between religious houses and granting exemptions and rights in his diocese. Chesney bought a house in London to serve as an episcopal residence, constructed an [episcopal palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Medieval_Bishop%27s_Palace) in Lincoln, and founded a religious house outside the city. He died in December 1166, probably on the 27th, and was buried in [Lincoln Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Cathedral).", "timestamp": 1656827899, "digest": "L_SC9zUdCB1yhdf-MLPqqBvFEdiQf9MbIR71CArK0qM", "contributor": "0xD65464f2c600e0135A232bd0D30e3bE57F5844AF"}

The son of a clergyman, he studied [canon law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law) and theology at [Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna) and was tutor to [Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes) [Eugene III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Eugene_III)'s nephew before returning to England to serve successive [bishops of Exeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Exeter).

Before becoming a bishop, he wrote theological works and sermons, some of which have survived.\n\nAs a bishop, Baldwin came to the attention of King [Henry II of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England), who was so impressed he insisted that Baldwin become archbishop. In that office, Baldwin quarrelled with his cathedral clergy over the founding of a church, which led to the imprisonment of the clergy in their cloister for more than a year. Baldwin spent some time in [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Wales) with [Gerald of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_of_Wales), preaching and raising money for the [Third Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Crusade).

He was the longest-serving holder of the office since the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation), and the first to retire from it.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh to a Scottish [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian) family, Davidson was educated at [Harrow School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School), where he became an Anglican, and at [Trinity College, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Oxford), where he was largely untouched by the arguments and debates between adherents of the [high-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-church) and [low-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-church) factions of the [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England). He was [ordained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination) in 1874, and, after a brief spell as a [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate), he became [chaplain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain) and secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury, [Archibald Campbell Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Campbell_Tait), in which post he became a confidant of [Queen Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria). He rose through the Church hierarchy, becoming [Dean of Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_of_Windsor) (1883), [Bishop of Rochester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Rochester) (1891) and [Bishop of Winchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Winchester) (1895). In 1903 he succeeded [Frederick Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Temple) as Archbishop of Canterbury, and remained in office until his retirement in November 1928.\n\nDavidson was conciliatory by nature, and spent much time throughout his term of office striving to keep the Church together in the face of deep and sometimes acrimonious divisions between [evangelicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Anglicanism) and [Anglo-Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Catholics). Under his leadership the Church gained some independence from state control, but his efforts to modernise the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)* were frustrated by Parliament.\n\nThough cautious about bringing the Church into domestic party politics, Davidson did not shy away from larger political issues: he played a key role in the passage of the reforming [Parliament Act 1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Act_1911); urged moderation on both sides in the conflict over Irish independence; campaigned against perceived immoral methods of warfare in the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) and led efforts to resolve the national crisis of the [1926 General Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1926_United_Kingdom_general_strike).

Branham", "body": "**William Marrion Branham** (April 6, 1909 – December 24, 1965) was an American Christian minister and [faith healer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_healing) who initiated the post–[World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) [healing revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing_revival), and claimed to be a prophet with the anointing of [Elijah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah), who had come to herald [Christ's second coming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming); some of his followers have been labeled a \"[doomsday cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_cult)\".[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-hwd-1)[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-lgp-2)[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-tcp-3) He is credited as \"a principal architect of [restorationist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorationist) thought\" for charismatics by some Christian historians,[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoriarty1992119-4) and has been called the \"leading individual in the [Second Wave of Pentecostalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-charismatic_movement).\"[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-5) He made a lasting influence on [televangelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Televangelism) and the modern [charismatic movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_movement),[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWeaver2000v-6) and his \"stage presence remains a legend unparalleled in the history of the Charismatic movement\".[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTESims1996195-7) At the time they were held, his inter-denominational meetings were the largest religious meetings ever held in some American cities. Branham was the first American [deliverance minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance_ministry) to successfully campaign in Europe; his ministry reached global audiences with major campaigns held in North America, Europe, Africa, and India.\n\nBranham claimed that he had received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry and launching his campaigning career in mid-1946. His fame rapidly spread as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings. His ministry spawned many emulators and set the broader healing revival that later became the modern [charismatic movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_movement) in motion. At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and \"the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation\".[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarrell197839-8) From 1955, Branham's campaigning and popularity began to decline as the [Pentecostal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostalism) churches began to withdraw their support from the healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons. By 1960, Branham transitioned into a teaching ministry.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who followed doctrinal teachings which are known as the [Full Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Gospel) tradition, Branham developed an alternative [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology) which was primarily a mixture of [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinist) and [Arminian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminian) doctrines, and had a heavy focus on [dispensationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism) and Branham's own unique [eschatological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology) views. While widely accepting the [restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorationism) doctrine he espoused during the healing revival, his divergent post-revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his charismatic and Pentecostal contemporaries, who subsequently disavowed many of the doctrines as \"revelatory madness\".[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoriarty199255-9) His racial teachings on [serpent seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_seed) and his belief that membership in a [Christian denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination) was connected to the [mark of the beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_beast) alienated many of his former supporters. His closest followers, however, accepted his sermons as oral [scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text) and refer to his teachings as The Message. Despite Branham's objections, some followers of his teachings placed him at the center of a [cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) during his final years. Branham claimed that he had converted over one million people during his career. His teachings continue to be promoted by the William Branham Evangelistic Association, which reported that about 2 million people received its material in 2018. Branham died following a car accident in 1965.\n\nThroughout his healing revivals, Branham was accused of committing [fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud) by investigative news reporters, fellow ministers, host churches, and governmental agencies. Numerous people pronounced healed died shortly thereafter, investigators discovered evidence suggesting miracles may have been staged, and Branham was found to have significantly embellished and falsified numerous stories he presented to his audiences as fact. Branham faced legal problems as a result of his practices. The governments of South Africa and Norway intervened in order to stop his healing campaigns in their countries. In the United States, Branham was charged with [tax evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion) for failing to account for the donations received through his ministry; admitting his liability, he settled the case out of court. The news media has linked Branham to multiple notorious figures. Branham was baptized and ordained a minister by [Roy Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Elonzo_Davis), the National [Imperial Wizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Wizard) (leader) of the [Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Ku_Klux_Klan); the two men maintained a lifelong relationship. Branham helped launch and popularize the ministry of [Jim Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones). [Paul Schäfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sch%C3%A4fer), [Robert Martin Gumbura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Martin_Gumbura), [Leo Mercer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Mercer), and other followers of William Branham's teachings have regularly been in the news due to the serious crimes which they committed.

He was the longest-serving holder of the office since the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation), and the first to retire from it.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh to a Scottish [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian) family, Davidson was educated at [Harrow School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School), where he became an Anglican, and at [Trinity College, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Oxford), where he was largely untouched by the arguments and debates between adherents of the [high-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-church) and [low-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-church) factions of the [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England). He was [ordained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination) in 1874, and, after a brief spell as a [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate), he became [chaplain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain) and secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury, [Archibald Campbell Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Campbell_Tait), in which post he became a confidant of [Queen Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria). He rose through the Church hierarchy, becoming [Dean of Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_of_Windsor) (1883), [Bishop of Rochester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Rochester) (1891) and [Bishop of Winchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Winchester) (1895). In 1903 he succeeded [Frederick Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Temple) as Archbishop of Canterbury, and remained in office until his retirement in November 1928.\n\nDavidson was conciliatory by nature, and spent much time throughout his term of office striving to keep the Church together in the face of deep and sometimes acrimonious divisions between [evangelicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Anglicanism) and [Anglo-Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Catholics). Under his leadership the Church gained some independence from state control, but his efforts to modernise the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)* were frustrated by Parliament.\n\nThough cautious about bringing the Church into domestic party politics, Davidson did not shy away from larger political issues: he played a key role in the passage of the reforming [Parliament Act 1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Act_1911); urged moderation on both sides in the conflict over Irish independence; campaigned against perceived immoral methods of warfare in the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) and led efforts to resolve the national crisis of the [1926 General Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1926_United_Kingdom_general_strike). He was a consistent advocate of Christian unity, and worked, often closely, with other religious leaders throughout his primacy.

In 1233, he was selected to lead the ailing [diocese of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Dunblane) in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), and faced a struggle to bring the [bishopric of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane) (or \"bishopric of [Strathearn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathearn)\") to financial viability. This involved many negotiations with the powerful religious institutions and secular authorities which had acquired control of the revenue that would normally have been the entitlement of Clement's bishopric. The negotiations proved difficult, forcing Clement to visit the [papal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope) [court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_curia) in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome). While not achieving all of his aims, Clement succeeded in saving the bishopric from relocation to [Inchaffray Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchaffray_Abbey). He also regained enough revenue to begin work on the new [Dunblane Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_Cathedral).\n\nHe faced a similar challenge with the impoverished [bishopric of Argyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Argyll) in the 1240s. He was given the job of restoring the viability of the [diocese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese) and installing a new bishop; this involved forming a close relationship with King [Alexander II of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Scotland). Clement was with the king during his campaign in [Argyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll) in 1249 and was at his side when he died during this campaign.

By 1250 he had established a reputation as one of the most active Dominican reformers in [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Great_Britain).

Walter appeared in the records for the first time in the 1330s, as a student at the [University of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris). From there he went on to the [University of Orléans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Orl%C3%A9ans), initially as a student before becoming a lecturer there. He studied [the arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts), [civil law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)) and [canon law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law), and was awarded many [university degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_degree), including two [doctorates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate). His studies were paid for, at least partially, by his [benefices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefice) in Scotland.

He began his royal service in the government of [Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England), serving as a vice-[chancellor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor). He also accumulated a number of ecclesiastical offices, becoming successively [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(priest)) of [Rouen Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen_Cathedral), treasurer of Rouen, and [archdeacon of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Oxford).

Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar's expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title. He remained in the office until late 1193, when he was summoned to Germany by the king, who was being held in captivity there. Coutances became a hostage for the final payment of Richard's ransom on the king's release in February 1194.\n\nCoutances took no further part in English government after returning from Germany. Instead he became involved in Norman affairs, including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of [Andely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Andelys) manor, an archiepiscopal property that Richard desired as a fortress. Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe. Richard went on to build the [castle of Gaillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_Gaillard) on the former archiepiscopal manor. After Richard's death, Coutances invested Prince John as Duke of Normandy, but was forced to pay 2,100 [Angevin pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angevin_pound) to secure contested rights from the new king.

In first-class matches, he played for Middlesex and Cambridge University. A fast bowler and hard-hitting lower-order batsman, Allen later became an influential cricket administrator who held key positions in the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which effectively ruled English cricket at the time; he also served as chairman of the England selectors.\n\nAllen was born in Australia and grew up in England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he established a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he was on the verge of the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932–33, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.\n\nFrom 1933, Allen worked in the London Stock Exchange, which limited the amount of cricket he could play. Even so, he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936–37 tour of Australia, when the home team won 3–2 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play irregularly for Middlesex until 1939; after the Second World War, in which he worked in military intelligence, he played occasionally for Middlesex and other teams into the 1950s. He captained England in a final Test series in the West Indies in 1947–48. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was able to build up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he often scored runs when his team were under pressure.\n\nAs Allen's first-class career came to a close, he moved into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He was instrumental in the creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate illegal bowling actions. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the D'Oliveira affair, a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to Lord's, where he died, aged 87, in 1989.", "timestamp": 1656830029, "digest": "1I91Pf3tofN5bCFa0l_YnREkqc2dOvzHBhJd39NQ0VQ", "contributor": "0x08A6c9787C263337EeF7C241Eb6059B630430370"}

He began his royal service in the government of [Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England), serving as a vice-[chancellor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor). He also accumulated a number of ecclesiastical offices, becoming successively [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(priest)) of [Rouen Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen_Cathedral), treasurer of Rouen, and [archdeacon of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Oxford). King Henry sent him on a number of diplomatic missions and finally rewarded him with the bishopric of Lincoln in 1183. He did not remain there long, for he was [translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(ecclesiastical)) to Rouen in late 1184.\n\nWhen [Richard I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England), King Henry's son, became king in 1189, Coutances absolved Richard for his rebellion against his father and invested him as Duke of Normandy. He then accompanied Richard to Sicily as the king began the [Third Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Crusade), but events in England prompted Richard to send the archbishop back to England to mediate between [William Longchamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Longchamp), the [justiciar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justiciar) whom Richard had left in charge of the kingdom, and Prince [John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_England), Richard's younger brother. Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar's expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title. He remained in the office until late 1193, when he was summoned to Germany by the king, who was being held in captivity there. Coutances became a hostage for the final payment of Richard's ransom on the king's release in February 1194.\n\nCoutances took no further part in English government after returning from Germany. Instead he became involved in Norman affairs, including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of [Andely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Andelys) manor, an archiepiscopal property that Richard desired as a fortress. Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe. Richard went on to build the [castle of Gaillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_Gaillard) on the former archiepiscopal manor. After Richard's death, Coutances invested Prince John as Duke of Normandy, but was forced to pay 2,100 [Angevin pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angevin_pound) to secure contested rights from the new king.

When Conwell removed and excommunicated [William Hogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hogan_(priest)), a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism.

Educated at Oxford or Paris, Chesney was [Archdeacon of Leicester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Leicester) before his election as bishop in December 1148.\n\nChesney served as a [royal justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_justice) in Lincolnshire during his bishopric, and maintained a close relationship with his nephew, Foliot. He was also an early patron of [Thomas Becket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Becket), and gave the young cleric an office in his diocese early in Becket's career. Although shown favour by [King Stephen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_of_England), including the right to a [mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_(facility)), Chesney was present at the coronation of [King Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England) in 1154 and went on to serve Henry as a royal justice. Around 1160, Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with [St Albans Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans_Abbey) in the diocese of Lincoln, over his right as bishop to supervise the abbey. The dispute was eventually settled when the abbey granted Chesney land in return for his relinquishing any right to oversee St Albans.\n\nChesney was active in his diocese; more than 240 documents relating to his episcopal career survive. They show him mediating disputes between religious houses and granting exemptions and rights in his diocese. Chesney bought a house in London to serve as an episcopal residence, constructed an [episcopal palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Medieval_Bishop%27s_Palace) in Lincoln, and founded a religious house outside the city.

Davidson strongly protested his innocence and to raise funds for his reinstatement campaign he exhibited himself in a barrel on the [Blackpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool) seafront. He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature, and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside spectacular.\n\nBefore his ordination in 1903, Davidson had a brief career on the London stage as an entertainer. As a young [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate) he became actively involved with charitable activity among London's poor, an interest he maintained following his appointment in 1906 as [rector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)) of the rural [Norfolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk) parish of [Stiffkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffkey).

Styling himself the \"Prostitutes' Padre\",[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Davidson#cite_note-1) his declared mission was the rescue of young girls he considered in danger of falling into vice. In this role he approached and befriended hundreds of girls and, although there was little direct evidence of improper behaviour, Davidson was frequently found in compromising situations. His neglect of his local duties over many years strained relations with his parishioners in Stiffkey; after a formal complaint, the [Bishop of Norwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Norwich) instituted disciplinary proceedings through a [consistory court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistory_court). Davidson's defence was severely compromised by his eccentric conduct, and was damaged beyond repair when the prosecution produced a photograph of him with a near-naked teenage girl.\n\nDavidson's later career as a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His attempts at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles that he had not been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.", "timestamp": 1656828826, "digest": "VfdSzOoh_tJ44i2gxqWieujH_SZToTjHw4HmTR_IXAk", "contributor": "0x67237Ebe4DB2408d808b2D7141D45b3f5eAee216"}

He was a principal figure in the development of the system of [Christian theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_theology) later called [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism), including its doctrines of [predestination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination) and of God's [absolute sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monergism) in the [salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation) of the human soul from death and [eternal damnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation).

He also exchanged cordial and supportive letters with many reformers, including [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) and [Heinrich Bullinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Bullinger). In addition to his seminal *[Institutes of the Christian Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutes_of_the_Christian_Religion)*, Calvin wrote commentaries on most books of the Bible, [confessional documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_of_faith), and various other theological treatises.\n\nCalvin was originally trained as a [humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Humanism) lawyer. He broke from the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church) around 1530. After religious tensions erupted in widespread deadly violence against [Protestant Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Christians) in France, Calvin fled to [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel), Switzerland, where in 1536 he published the first edition of the *Institutes*. In that same year, Calvin was recruited by Frenchman [William Farel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Farel) to join the Reformation in [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva), where he regularly preached sermons throughout the week. However, the governing council of the city resisted the implementation of their ideas, and both men were expelled. At the invitation of [Martin Bucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bucer), Calvin proceeded to [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg), where he became the minister of a church of French refugees. He continued to support the reform movement in Geneva, and in 1541 he was invited back to lead the church of the city.\n\nFollowing his return, Calvin introduced new forms of church government and [liturgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_liturgy), despite opposition from several powerful families in the city who tried to curb his authority. During this period, [Michael Servetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Servetus), a Spaniard regarded by both Roman Catholics and Protestants as having a [heretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_heresy) view of the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), arrived in Geneva. He was denounced by Calvin and [burned at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned_at_the_stake) for heresy by the city council. Following an influx of supportive refugees and new elections to the city council, Calvin's opponents were forced out.

Walter appeared in the records for the first time in the 1330s, as a student at the [University of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris). From there he went on to the [University of Orléans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Orl%C3%A9ans), initially as a student before becoming a lecturer there. He studied [the arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts), [civil law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)) and [canon law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law), and was awarded many [university degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_degree), including two [doctorates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate). His studies were paid for, at least partially, by his [benefices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefice) in Scotland. Despite holding perhaps more than five benefices at one stage, he did not return to Scotland until the late 1350s.\n\nFollowing his return to Scotland, Walter soon became [Dean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(religion)) of [Aberdeen Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Machar%27s_Cathedral). From there he became engaged in high-level ecclesiastical affairs with the Scottish church and political affairs with [the Earl of Mar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_II,_Earl_of_Mar). Sometime before June 1361, the [cathedral chapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_chapter) of [Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane) elected him [Bishop of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane). He went to [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) to secure confirmation from the Pope at [Avignon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon), who authorised his [consecration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecration). Walter was bishop for 10 years after returning home to Scotland. Records of his episcopate are thin, but there are enough to allow a modest reconstruction of his activities: he presided over legal disputes, issued a dispensation for an important irregular marriage, attended parliaments, and acted as an envoy of the Scottish crown in England. He died in either 1371 or 1372.", "timestamp": 1656828636, "digest": "7xhcB5M4wbRMoORjj3Ddv80HO3gzyWUHdjbz1fmdCq8", "contributor": "0xFb81Df33EfacD875bbebB9C5e2Ced44CC32F2aa9"}

A native of [Shropshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shropshire), he served as a minor royal official before entering into the service of Prince Edward, the future King [Edward I of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England).

He also helped with the legislative and legal reforms of Edward's reign. During Burnell's tenure the chancellor's office and records became fixed in London rather than travelling with the king.

He was also an early patron of [Thomas Becket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Becket), and gave the young cleric an office in his diocese early in Becket's career. Although shown favour by [King Stephen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_of_England), including the right to a [mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_(facility)), Chesney was present at the coronation of [King Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England) in 1154 and went on to serve Henry as a royal justice. Around 1160, Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with [St Albans Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans_Abbey) in the diocese of Lincoln, over his right as bishop to supervise the abbey. The dispute was eventually settled when the abbey granted Chesney land in return for his relinquishing any right to oversee St Albans.\n\nChesney was active in his diocese; more than 240 documents relating to his episcopal career survive.

In 1233, he was selected to lead the ailing [diocese of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Dunblane) in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), and faced a struggle to bring the [bishopric of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane) (or \"bishopric of [Strathearn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathearn)\") to financial viability. This involved many negotiations with the powerful religious institutions and secular authorities which had acquired control of the revenue that would normally have been the entitlement of Clement's bishopric. The negotiations proved difficult, forcing Clement to visit the [papal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope) [court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_curia) in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome). While not achieving all of his aims, Clement succeeded in saving the bishopric from relocation to [Inchaffray Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchaffray_Abbey). He also regained enough revenue to begin work on the new [Dunblane Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_Cathedral).\n\nHe faced a similar challenge with the impoverished [bishopric of Argyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Argyll) in the 1240s.

Davidson strongly protested his innocence and to raise funds for his reinstatement campaign he exhibited himself in a barrel on the [Blackpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool) seafront. He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature, and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside spectacular.\n\nBefore his ordination in 1903, Davidson had a brief career on the London stage as an entertainer. As a young [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate) he became actively involved with charitable activity among London's poor, an interest he maintained following his appointment in 1906 as [rector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)) of the rural [Norfolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk) parish of [Stiffkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffkey).

In this role he approached and befriended hundreds of girls and, although there was little direct evidence of improper behaviour, Davidson was frequently found in compromising situations. His neglect of his local duties over many years strained relations with his parishioners in Stiffkey; after a formal complaint, the [Bishop of Norwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Norwich) instituted disciplinary proceedings through a [consistory court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistory_court). Davidson's defence was severely compromised by his eccentric conduct, and was damaged beyond repair when the prosecution produced a photograph of him with a near-naked teenage girl.\n\nDavidson's later career as a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His attempts at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles that he had not been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story.

After the coronation of King [Richard I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England), the new king sent Baldwin ahead to the [Holy Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land), where he became embroiled in the politics of the [Kingdom of Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Jerusalem). Baldwin died in the Holy Land while participating in the crusade; his long-running dispute with his clergy led one chronicler to characterise Baldwin as more damaging to Christianity than [Saladin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin).", "timestamp": 1656826358, "digest": "RrDxpiKr4kLdAsH8Jl4PJaPWPSJtJqquTtgUr-6VfLw", "contributor": "0x76e13ba561A04088617A3125Eb9FdfE6bB170fc6"}

In first-class matches, he played for Middlesex and Cambridge University. A fast bowler and hard-hitting lower-order batsman, Allen later became an influential cricket administrator who held key positions in the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which effectively ruled English cricket at the time; he also served as chairman of the England selectors.\n\nAllen was born in Australia and grew up in England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he established a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he was on the verge of the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932–33, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.\n\nFrom 1933, Allen worked in the London Stock Exchange, which limited the amount of cricket he could play. Even so, he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936–37 tour of Australia, when the home team won 3–2 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play irregularly for Middlesex until 1939; after the Second World War, in which he worked in military intelligence, he played occasionally for Middlesex and other teams into the 1950s. He captained England in a final Test series in the West Indies in 1947–48. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was able to build up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he often scored runs when his team were under pressure.\n\nAs Allen's first-class career came to a close, he moved into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He was instrumental in the creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate illegal bowling actions. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the D'Oliveira affair, a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to Lord's, where he died, aged 87, in 1989.", "timestamp": 1656830029, "digest": "1I91Pf3tofN5bCFa0l_YnREkqc2dOvzHBhJd39NQ0VQ", "contributor": "0x08A6c9787C263337EeF7C241Eb6059B630430370"}

He was a principal figure in the development of the system of [Christian theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_theology) later called [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism), including its doctrines of [predestination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination) and of God's [absolute sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monergism) in the [salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation) of the human soul from death and [eternal damnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation). Calvinist doctrines were [influenced by and elaborated upon the Augustinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustinian_Calvinism) and other Christian traditions. Various [Congregational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregational_church), [Reformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_churches) and [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian) churches, which look to Calvin as the chief expositor of their beliefs, have spread throughout the world.\n\nCalvin was a tireless [polemicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemicist) and [apologetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_apologetics) writer who generated much controversy. He also exchanged cordial and supportive letters with many reformers, including [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) and [Heinrich Bullinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Bullinger). In addition to his seminal *[Institutes of the Christian Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutes_of_the_Christian_Religion)*, Calvin wrote commentaries on most books of the Bible, [confessional documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_of_faith), and various other theological treatises.\n\nCalvin was originally trained as a [humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Humanism) lawyer. He broke from the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church) around 1530. After religious tensions erupted in widespread deadly violence against [Protestant Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Christians) in France, Calvin fled to [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel), Switzerland, where in 1536 he published the first edition of the *Institutes*. In that same year, Calvin was recruited by Frenchman [William Farel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Farel) to join the Reformation in [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva), where he regularly preached sermons throughout the week. However, the governing council of the city resisted the implementation of their ideas, and both men were expelled. At the invitation of [Martin Bucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bucer), Calvin proceeded to [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg), where he became the minister of a church of French refugees. He continued to support the reform movement in Geneva, and in 1541 he was invited back to lead the church of the city.\n\nFollowing his return, Calvin introduced new forms of church government and [liturgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_liturgy), despite opposition from several powerful families in the city who tried to curb his authority. During this period, [Michael Servetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Servetus), a Spaniard regarded by both Roman Catholics and Protestants as having a [heretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_heresy) view of the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), arrived in Geneva. He was denounced by Calvin and [burned at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned_at_the_stake) for heresy by the city council. Following an influx of supportive refugees and new elections to the city council, Calvin's opponents were forced out. Calvin spent his final years promoting the Reformation both in Geneva and throughout Europe.", "timestamp": 1656827748, "digest": "-n8tI6ROe8agkxGBLsUw8UStXZIBJuRCs7LZWjF-BdI", "contributor": "0x3514ba749D7d718a96033d2576d6C106DffFd5cb"}

There is no direct evidence of his birthdate, his family, or his family's origin, although he may have come from the region around [Abernethy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abernethy,_Perth_and_Kinross) (in modern-day [Perth and Kinross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_and_Kinross)), where a family with the name de Coventre is known to have lived. Walter appeared in the records for the first time in the 1330s, as a student at the [University of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris). From there he went on to the [University of Orléans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Orl%C3%A9ans), initially as a student before becoming a lecturer there. He studied [the arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_arts), [civil law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)) and [canon law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law), and was awarded many [university degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_degree), including two [doctorates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate). His studies were paid for, at least partially, by his [benefices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefice) in Scotland. Despite holding perhaps more than five benefices at one stage, he did not return to Scotland until the late 1350s.\n\nFollowing his return to Scotland, Walter soon became [Dean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(religion)) of [Aberdeen Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Machar%27s_Cathedral). From there he became engaged in high-level ecclesiastical affairs with the Scottish church and political affairs with [the Earl of Mar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_II,_Earl_of_Mar). Sometime before June 1361, the [cathedral chapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_chapter) of [Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane) elected him [Bishop of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane). He went to [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) to secure confirmation from the Pope at [Avignon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon), who authorised his [consecration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecration). Walter was bishop for 10 years after returning home to Scotland. Records of his episcopate are thin, but there are enough to allow a modest reconstruction of his activities: he presided over legal disputes, issued a dispensation for an important irregular marriage, attended parliaments, and acted as an envoy of the Scottish crown in England. He died in either 1371 or 1372.", "timestamp": 1656828636, "digest": "7xhcB5M4wbRMoORjj3Ddv80HO3gzyWUHdjbz1fmdCq8", "contributor": "0xFb81Df33EfacD875bbebB9C5e2Ced44CC32F2aa9"}

For most of his career he was a member of the [New York Knickerbockers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knickerbockers). He first played for the New York Base Ball Club in 1840 and started his Knickerbockers career five years later, continuing to play for the club into his forties and to take part in inter-squad practice games and matches against opposing teams. Researchers have called Adams the creator of the [shortstop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop) position, which he used to field short throws from [outfielders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder). In addition to his playing career, Adams manufactured baseballs and oversaw [bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat) production; he also occasionally acted as an [umpire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)).\n\nFrom 1847 to 1861, the Knickerbockers selected Adams as their president six times, and as a vice president, treasurer, or director in six other years. As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-[inning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning) games. When the [National Association of Base Ball Players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Base_Ball_Players) (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' [bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field#Specifications) should be 90 feet (27 m) apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \"bound rule\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as [outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)). He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)*; by 1993, researcher [John Thorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thorn) had written about Adams' role. Other historians have given him credit for helping to develop the sport, and Thorn has called Adams \"first among the Fathers of Baseball\".[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Adams#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThorn19937-1)\n\nA graduate of [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University) and [Harvard Medical School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School), Adams began working in the medical field in the late 1830s, and practiced in New York City during his time as a member of the Knickerbockers. In 1865, he left medicine and later became a bank president and member of the [Connecticut legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_House_of_Representatives).

He was the longest-serving holder of the office since the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation), and the first to retire from it.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh to a Scottish [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian) family, Davidson was educated at [Harrow School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School), where he became an Anglican, and at [Trinity College, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Oxford), where he was largely untouched by the arguments and debates between adherents of the [high-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-church) and [low-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-church) factions of the [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England). He was [ordained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination) in 1874, and, after a brief spell as a [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate), he became [chaplain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain) and secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury, [Archibald Campbell Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Campbell_Tait), in which post he became a confidant of [Queen Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria). He rose through the Church hierarchy, becoming [Dean of Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_of_Windsor) (1883), [Bishop of Rochester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Rochester) (1891) and [Bishop of Winchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Winchester) (1895). In 1903 he succeeded [Frederick Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Temple) as Archbishop of Canterbury, and remained in office until his retirement in November 1928.\n\nDavidson was conciliatory by nature, and spent much time throughout his term of office striving to keep the Church together in the face of deep and sometimes acrimonious divisions between [evangelicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Anglicanism) and [Anglo-Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Catholics). Under his leadership the Church gained some independence from state control, but his efforts to modernise the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)* were frustrated by Parliament.\n\nThough cautious about bringing the Church into domestic party politics, Davidson did not shy away from larger political issues: he played a key role in the passage of the reforming [Parliament Act 1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Act_1911); urged moderation on both sides in the conflict over Irish independence; campaigned against perceived immoral methods of warfare in the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) and led efforts to resolve the national crisis of the [1926 General Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1926_United_Kingdom_general_strike).

For most of his career he was a member of the [New York Knickerbockers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knickerbockers). He first played for the New York Base Ball Club in 1840 and started his Knickerbockers career five years later, continuing to play for the club into his forties and to take part in inter-squad practice games and matches against opposing teams. Researchers have called Adams the creator of the [shortstop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop) position, which he used to field short throws from [outfielders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder). In addition to his playing career, Adams manufactured baseballs and oversaw [bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat) production; he also occasionally acted as an [umpire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)).\n\nFrom 1847 to 1861, the Knickerbockers selected Adams as their president six times, and as a vice president, treasurer, or director in six other years. As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-[inning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning) games. When the [National Association of Base Ball Players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Base_Ball_Players) (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' [bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field#Specifications) should be 90 feet (27 m) apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \"bound rule\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as [outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)). He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)*; by 1993, researcher [John Thorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thorn) had written about Adams' role. Other historians have given him credit for helping to develop the sport, and Thorn has called Adams \"first among the Fathers of Baseball\".[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Adams#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThorn19937-1)\n\nA graduate of [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University) and [Harvard Medical School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School), Adams began working in the medical field in the late 1830s, and practiced in New York City during his time as a member of the Knickerbockers. In 1865, he left medicine and later became a bank president and member of the [Connecticut legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_House_of_Representatives).

Bucer was originally a member of the [Dominican Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order), but after meeting and being influenced by [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) in 1518 he arranged for his [monastic vows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_vows) to be annulled. He then began to work for the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation), with the support of [Franz von Sickingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Sickingen).\n\nBucer's efforts to reform the church in [Wissembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wissembourg) resulted in his [excommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication) from the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church), and he was forced to flee to Strasbourg. There he joined a team of reformers which included [Matthew Zell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Zell), [Wolfgang Capito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Capito), and [Caspar Hedio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Hedio). He acted as a mediator between the two leading reformers, Martin Luther and [Huldrych Zwingli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldrych_Zwingli), who differed on the doctrine of the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist). Later, Bucer sought agreement on common articles of faith such as the [Tetrapolitan Confession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapolitan_Confession) and the [Wittenberg Concord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittenberg_Concord), working closely with [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) on the latter.\n\nBucer believed that the [Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholics) in the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire) could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by [Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the [Schmalkaldic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmalkaldic_War) and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the [Augsburg Interim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg_Interim), which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.\n\nIn 1549, Bucer was exiled to England, where, under the guidance of [Thomas Cranmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer), he was able to influence the second revision of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*. He died in [Cambridge, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_England), at the age of 59. Although his ministry did not lead to the formation of a new denomination, many Protestant denominations have claimed him as one of their own. He is remembered as an early pioneer of [ecumenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenism).", "timestamp": 1656826696, "digest": "1qT5odKQctR-ftzjO3gQ17vC-cwX6mLxHrI8Hi5zET4", "contributor": "0x0cfF56FD246E455A8B19359241C4329B08893b33"}

He began his royal service in the government of [Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England), serving as a vice-[chancellor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor). He also accumulated a number of ecclesiastical offices, becoming successively [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(priest)) of [Rouen Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen_Cathedral), treasurer of Rouen, and [archdeacon of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Oxford). King Henry sent him on a number of diplomatic missions and finally rewarded him with the bishopric of Lincoln in 1183. He did not remain there long, for he was [translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(ecclesiastical)) to Rouen in late 1184.\n\nWhen [Richard I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England), King Henry's son, became king in 1189, Coutances absolved Richard for his rebellion against his father and invested him as Duke of Normandy. He then accompanied Richard to Sicily as the king began the [Third Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Crusade), but events in England prompted Richard to send the archbishop back to England to mediate between [William Longchamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Longchamp), the [justiciar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justiciar) whom Richard had left in charge of the kingdom, and Prince [John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_England), Richard's younger brother. Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar's expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title. He remained in the office until late 1193, when he was summoned to Germany by the king, who was being held in captivity there. Coutances became a hostage for the final payment of Richard's ransom on the king's release in February 1194.\n\nCoutances took no further part in English government after returning from Germany. Instead he became involved in Norman affairs, including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of [Andely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Andelys) manor, an archiepiscopal property that Richard desired as a fortress. Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe. Richard went on to build the [castle of Gaillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_Gaillard) on the former archiepiscopal manor. After Richard's death, Coutances invested Prince John as Duke of Normandy, but was forced to pay 2,100 [Angevin pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angevin_pound) to secure contested rights from the new king. After John lost control of Normandy in 1204, the archbishop did not resist the new government of King [Philip II of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_France).

He was a principal figure in the development of the system of [Christian theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_theology) later called [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism), including its doctrines of [predestination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination) and of God's [absolute sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monergism) in the [salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation) of the human soul from death and [eternal damnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation).

Various [Congregational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregational_church), [Reformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_churches) and [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian) churches, which look to Calvin as the chief expositor of their beliefs, have spread throughout the world.\n\nCalvin was a tireless [polemicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemicist) and [apologetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_apologetics) writer who generated much controversy. He also exchanged cordial and supportive letters with many reformers, including [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) and [Heinrich Bullinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Bullinger). In addition to his seminal *[Institutes of the Christian Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutes_of_the_Christian_Religion)*, Calvin wrote commentaries on most books of the Bible, [confessional documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_of_faith), and various other theological treatises.\n\nCalvin was originally trained as a [humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Humanism) lawyer. He broke from the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church) around 1530. After religious tensions erupted in widespread deadly violence against [Protestant Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Christians) in France, Calvin fled to [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel), Switzerland, where in 1536 he published the first edition of the *Institutes*. In that same year, Calvin was recruited by Frenchman [William Farel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Farel) to join the Reformation in [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva), where he regularly preached sermons throughout the week. However, the governing council of the city resisted the implementation of their ideas, and both men were expelled. At the invitation of [Martin Bucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bucer), Calvin proceeded to [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg), where he became the minister of a church of French refugees. He continued to support the reform movement in Geneva, and in 1541 he was invited back to lead the church of the city.\n\nFollowing his return, Calvin introduced new forms of church government and [liturgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_liturgy), despite opposition from several powerful families in the city who tried to curb his authority. During this period, [Michael Servetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Servetus), a Spaniard regarded by both Roman Catholics and Protestants as having a [heretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_heresy) view of the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), arrived in Geneva. He was denounced by Calvin and [burned at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned_at_the_stake) for heresy by the city council. Following an influx of supportive refugees and new elections to the city council, Calvin's opponents were forced out. Calvin spent his final years promoting the Reformation both in Geneva and throughout Europe.", "timestamp": 1656827748, "digest": "-n8tI6ROe8agkxGBLsUw8UStXZIBJuRCs7LZWjF-BdI", "contributor": "0x3514ba749D7d718a96033d2576d6C106DffFd5cb"}

He began his royal service in the government of [Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England), serving as a vice-[chancellor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor). He also accumulated a number of ecclesiastical offices, becoming successively [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(priest)) of [Rouen Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen_Cathedral), treasurer of Rouen, and [archdeacon of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Oxford). King Henry sent him on a number of diplomatic missions and finally rewarded him with the bishopric of Lincoln in 1183. He did not remain there long, for he was [translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(ecclesiastical)) to Rouen in late 1184.\n\nWhen [Richard I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England), King Henry's son, became king in 1189, Coutances absolved Richard for his rebellion against his father and invested him as Duke of Normandy. He then accompanied Richard to Sicily as the king began the [Third Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Crusade), but events in England prompted Richard to send the archbishop back to England to mediate between [William Longchamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Longchamp), the [justiciar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justiciar) whom Richard had left in charge of the kingdom, and Prince [John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_England), Richard's younger brother. Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar's expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title. He remained in the office until late 1193, when he was summoned to Germany by the king, who was being held in captivity there. Coutances became a hostage for the final payment of Richard's ransom on the king's release in February 1194.\n\nCoutances took no further part in English government after returning from Germany. Instead he became involved in Norman affairs, including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of [Andely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Andelys) manor, an archiepiscopal property that Richard desired as a fortress. Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe. Richard went on to build the [castle of Gaillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_Gaillard) on the former archiepiscopal manor. After Richard's death, Coutances invested Prince John as Duke of Normandy, but was forced to pay 2,100 [Angevin pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angevin_pound) to secure contested rights from the new king. After John lost control of Normandy in 1204, the archbishop did not resist the new government of King [Philip II of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_France). Coutances died in November 1207 and was buried in his cathedral.", "timestamp": 1656828522, "digest": "clc4shM38pa6qZpTtp_3r8oTW6M-0vmv1bMEZAowfXY", "contributor": "0xEc37890b1f4942202Fed891535263ca9718c1534"}

Davidson strongly protested his innocence and to raise funds for his reinstatement campaign he exhibited himself in a barrel on the [Blackpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool) seafront. He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature, and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside spectacular.\n\nBefore his ordination in 1903, Davidson had a brief career on the London stage as an entertainer. As a young [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate) he became actively involved with charitable activity among London's poor, an interest he maintained following his appointment in 1906 as [rector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)) of the rural [Norfolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk) parish of [Stiffkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffkey). After the First World War, in which he served as a naval chaplain, he devoted himself primarily to his London work. Styling himself the \"Prostitutes' Padre\",[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Davidson#cite_note-1) his declared mission was the rescue of young girls he considered in danger of falling into vice. In this role he approached and befriended hundreds of girls and, although there was little direct evidence of improper behaviour, Davidson was frequently found in compromising situations. His neglect of his local duties over many years strained relations with his parishioners in Stiffkey; after a formal complaint, the [Bishop of Norwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Norwich) instituted disciplinary proceedings through a [consistory court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistory_court). Davidson's defence was severely compromised by his eccentric conduct, and was damaged beyond repair when the prosecution produced a photograph of him with a near-naked teenage girl.\n\nDavidson's later career as a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His attempts at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles that he had not been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.", "timestamp": 1656828826, "digest": "VfdSzOoh_tJ44i2gxqWieujH_SZToTjHw4HmTR_IXAk", "contributor": "0x67237Ebe4DB2408d808b2D7141D45b3f5eAee216"}

He was a principal figure in the development of the system of [Christian theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_theology) later called [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism), including its doctrines of [predestination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination) and of God's [absolute sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monergism) in the [salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation) of the human soul from death and [eternal damnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation).

Various [Congregational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregational_church), [Reformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_churches) and [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian) churches, which look to Calvin as the chief expositor of their beliefs, have spread throughout the world.\n\nCalvin was a tireless [polemicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemicist) and [apologetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_apologetics) writer who generated much controversy. He also exchanged cordial and supportive letters with many reformers, including [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) and [Heinrich Bullinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Bullinger). In addition to his seminal *[Institutes of the Christian Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutes_of_the_Christian_Religion)*, Calvin wrote commentaries on most books of the Bible, [confessional documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_of_faith), and various other theological treatises.\n\nCalvin was originally trained as a [humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Humanism) lawyer. He broke from the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church) around 1530. After religious tensions erupted in widespread deadly violence against [Protestant Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Christians) in France, Calvin fled to [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel), Switzerland, where in 1536 he published the first edition of the *Institutes*. In that same year, Calvin was recruited by Frenchman [William Farel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Farel) to join the Reformation in [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva), where he regularly preached sermons throughout the week. However, the governing council of the city resisted the implementation of their ideas, and both men were expelled. At the invitation of [Martin Bucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bucer), Calvin proceeded to [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg), where he became the minister of a church of French refugees. He continued to support the reform movement in Geneva, and in 1541 he was invited back to lead the church of the city.\n\nFollowing his return, Calvin introduced new forms of church government and [liturgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_liturgy), despite opposition from several powerful families in the city who tried to curb his authority. During this period, [Michael Servetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Servetus), a Spaniard regarded by both Roman Catholics and Protestants as having a [heretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_heresy) view of the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), arrived in Geneva. He was denounced by Calvin and [burned at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned_at_the_stake) for heresy by the city council. Following an influx of supportive refugees and new elections to the city council, Calvin's opponents were forced out.

The son of a clergyman, he studied [canon law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law) and theology at [Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna) and was tutor to [Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes) [Eugene III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Eugene_III)'s nephew before returning to England to serve successive [bishops of Exeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Exeter).

In 1233, he was selected to lead the ailing [diocese of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Dunblane) in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), and faced a struggle to bring the [bishopric of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane) (or \"bishopric of [Strathearn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathearn)\") to financial viability. This involved many negotiations with the powerful religious institutions and secular authorities which had acquired control of the revenue that would normally have been the entitlement of Clement's bishopric. The negotiations proved difficult, forcing Clement to visit the [papal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope) [court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_curia) in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome). While not achieving all of his aims, Clement succeeded in saving the bishopric from relocation to [Inchaffray Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchaffray_Abbey). He also regained enough revenue to begin work on the new [Dunblane Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_Cathedral).\n\nHe faced a similar challenge with the impoverished [bishopric of Argyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Argyll) in the 1240s. He was given the job of restoring the viability of the [diocese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese) and installing a new bishop; this involved forming a close relationship with King [Alexander II of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Scotland). Clement was with the king during his campaign in [Argyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll) in 1249 and was at his side when he died during this campaign. In 1250 Clement had been able to install a new bishop in Argyll and had become one of the Guardians appointed to govern Scotland during the [minority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent) of King [Alexander III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Scotland). By 1250 he had established a reputation as one of the most active Dominican reformers in [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Great_Britain). Clement helped to elevate [Edmund of Abingdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Rich) and [Queen Margaret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Margaret_of_Scotland) to sainthood. After his death, he received [veneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneration) as a [saint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint#Catholic_Church) himself, although he was never formally [canonised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonization).", "timestamp": 1656827986, "digest": "3l2QDE8WFDAnNbCjPpEMBxWI1hTCt5zYWI24LAJ_Ie8", "contributor": "0xB7cd3d52DD98E23337E2f85A8EA707E700D98B8C"}

Educated at Oxford or Paris, Chesney was [Archdeacon of Leicester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Leicester) before his election as bishop in December 1148.\n\nChesney served as a [royal justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_justice) in Lincolnshire during his bishopric, and maintained a close relationship with his nephew, Foliot. He was also an early patron of [Thomas Becket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Becket), and gave the young cleric an office in his diocese early in Becket's career. Although shown favour by [King Stephen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_of_England), including the right to a [mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_(facility)), Chesney was present at the coronation of [King Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England) in 1154 and went on to serve Henry as a royal justice. Around 1160, Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with [St Albans Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans_Abbey) in the diocese of Lincoln, over his right as bishop to supervise the abbey. The dispute was eventually settled when the abbey granted Chesney land in return for his relinquishing any right to oversee St Albans.\n\nChesney was active in his diocese; more than 240 documents relating to his episcopal career survive. They show him mediating disputes between religious houses and granting exemptions and rights in his diocese. Chesney bought a house in London to serve as an episcopal residence, constructed an [episcopal palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Medieval_Bishop%27s_Palace) in Lincoln, and founded a religious house outside the city.

Branham was the first American [deliverance minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance_ministry) to successfully campaign in Europe; his ministry reached global audiences with major campaigns held in North America, Europe, Africa, and India.\n\nBranham claimed that he had received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry and launching his campaigning career in mid-1946. His fame rapidly spread as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings. His ministry spawned many emulators and set the broader healing revival that later became the modern [charismatic movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_movement) in motion. At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and \"the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation\".[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarrell197839-8) From 1955, Branham's campaigning and popularity began to decline as the [Pentecostal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostalism) churches began to withdraw their support from the healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons. By 1960, Branham transitioned into a teaching ministry.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who followed doctrinal teachings which are known as the [Full Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Gospel) tradition, Branham developed an alternative [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology) which was primarily a mixture of [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinist) and [Arminian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminian) doctrines, and had a heavy focus on [dispensationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism) and Branham's own unique [eschatological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology) views. While widely accepting the [restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorationism) doctrine he espoused during the healing revival, his divergent post-revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his charismatic and Pentecostal contemporaries, who subsequently disavowed many of the doctrines as \"revelatory madness\".[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoriarty199255-9) His racial teachings on [serpent seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_seed) and his belief that membership in a [Christian denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination) was connected to the [mark of the beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_beast) alienated many of his former supporters. His closest followers, however, accepted his sermons as oral [scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text) and refer to his teachings as The Message. Despite Branham's objections, some followers of his teachings placed him at the center of a [cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) during his final years. Branham claimed that he had converted over one million people during his career. His teachings continue to be promoted by the William Branham Evangelistic Association, which reported that about 2 million people received its material in 2018. Branham died following a car accident in 1965.\n\nThroughout his healing revivals, Branham was accused of committing [fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud) by investigative news reporters, fellow ministers, host churches, and governmental agencies. Numerous people pronounced healed died shortly thereafter, investigators discovered evidence suggesting miracles may have been staged, and Branham was found to have significantly embellished and falsified numerous stories he presented to his audiences as fact. Branham faced legal problems as a result of his practices. The governments of South Africa and Norway intervened in order to stop his healing campaigns in their countries. In the United States, Branham was charged with [tax evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion) for failing to account for the donations received through his ministry; admitting his liability, he settled the case out of court. The news media has linked Branham to multiple notorious figures. Branham was baptized and ordained a minister by [Roy Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Elonzo_Davis), the National [Imperial Wizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Wizard) (leader) of the [Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Ku_Klux_Klan); the two men maintained a lifelong relationship. Branham helped launch and popularize the ministry of [Jim Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones). [Paul Schäfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sch%C3%A4fer), [Robert Martin Gumbura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Martin_Gumbura), [Leo Mercer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Mercer), and other followers of William Branham's teachings have regularly been in the news due to the serious crimes which they committed.

He helped build the case for the annulment of Henry's marriage to [Catherine of Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon), which was one of the causes of the separation of the English Church from union with the [Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See). Along with [Thomas Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cromwell), he supported the principle of [royal supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Supremacy), in which the king was considered sovereign over the Church within his realm.\n\nDuring Cranmer's tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury, he was responsible for establishing the first doctrinal and liturgical structures of the reformed [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England). Under Henry's rule, Cranmer did not make many radical changes in the Church, due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers. He published the first officially authorised [vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular) service, the *[Exhortation and Litany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhortation_and_Litany)*.\n\nWhen Edward came to the throne, Cranmer was able to promote major reforms. He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*, a complete liturgy for the English Church. With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge, he changed doctrine or discipline in areas such as the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist), [clerical celibacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerical_celibacy), the role of [images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_image) in places of worship, and the [veneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneration) of saints. Cranmer [promulgated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promulgate) the new doctrines through the Prayer Book, the *[Homilies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_Homilies)* and other publications.\n\nAfter the accession of the [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic) Mary I, Cranmer was put on trial for treason and [heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy). Imprisoned for over two years and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several [recantations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recantation) and apparently reconciled himself with the Catholic Church.

There he joined a team of reformers which included [Matthew Zell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Zell), [Wolfgang Capito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Capito), and [Caspar Hedio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Hedio). He acted as a mediator between the two leading reformers, Martin Luther and [Huldrych Zwingli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldrych_Zwingli), who differed on the doctrine of the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist). Later, Bucer sought agreement on common articles of faith such as the [Tetrapolitan Confession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapolitan_Confession) and the [Wittenberg Concord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittenberg_Concord), working closely with [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) on the latter.\n\nBucer believed that the [Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholics) in the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire) could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by [Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the [Schmalkaldic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmalkaldic_War) and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the [Augsburg Interim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg_Interim), which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.\n\nIn 1549, Bucer was exiled to England, where, under the guidance of [Thomas Cranmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer), he was able to influence the second revision of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*. He died in [Cambridge, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_England), at the age of 59. Although his ministry did not lead to the formation of a new denomination, many Protestant denominations have claimed him as one of their own. He is remembered as an early pioneer of [ecumenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenism).", "timestamp": 1656826696, "digest": "1qT5odKQctR-ftzjO3gQ17vC-cwX6mLxHrI8Hi5zET4", "contributor": "0x0cfF56FD246E455A8B19359241C4329B08893b33"}

In 1233, he was selected to lead the ailing [diocese of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Dunblane) in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), and faced a struggle to bring the [bishopric of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane) (or \"bishopric of [Strathearn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathearn)\") to financial viability. This involved many negotiations with the powerful religious institutions and secular authorities which had acquired control of the revenue that would normally have been the entitlement of Clement's bishopric. The negotiations proved difficult, forcing Clement to visit the [papal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope) [court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_curia) in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome). While not achieving all of his aims, Clement succeeded in saving the bishopric from relocation to [Inchaffray Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchaffray_Abbey).

Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar's expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title.

He first played for the New York Base Ball Club in 1840 and started his Knickerbockers career five years later, continuing to play for the club into his forties and to take part in inter-squad practice games and matches against opposing teams. Researchers have called Adams the creator of the [shortstop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop) position, which he used to field short throws from [outfielders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder). In addition to his playing career, Adams manufactured baseballs and oversaw [bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat) production; he also occasionally acted as an [umpire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)).\n\nFrom 1847 to 1861, the Knickerbockers selected Adams as their president six times, and as a vice president, treasurer, or director in six other years. As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-[inning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning) games. When the [National Association of Base Ball Players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Base_Ball_Players) (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' [bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field#Specifications) should be 90 feet (27 m) apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \"bound rule\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as [outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)). He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)*; by 1993, researcher [John Thorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thorn) had written about Adams' role.

After religious tensions erupted in widespread deadly violence against [Protestant Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Christians) in France, Calvin fled to [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel), Switzerland, where in 1536 he published the first edition of the *Institutes*. In that same year, Calvin was recruited by Frenchman [William Farel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Farel) to join the Reformation in [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva), where he regularly preached sermons throughout the week. However, the governing council of the city resisted the implementation of their ideas, and both men were expelled. At the invitation of [Martin Bucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bucer), Calvin proceeded to [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg), where he became the minister of a church of French refugees. He continued to support the reform movement in Geneva, and in 1541 he was invited back to lead the church of the city.\n\nFollowing his return, Calvin introduced new forms of church government and [liturgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_liturgy), despite opposition from several powerful families in the city who tried to curb his authority. During this period, [Michael Servetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Servetus), a Spaniard regarded by both Roman Catholics and Protestants as having a [heretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_heresy) view of the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), arrived in Geneva. He was denounced by Calvin and [burned at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned_at_the_stake) for heresy by the city council. Following an influx of supportive refugees and new elections to the city council, Calvin's opponents were forced out. Calvin spent his final years promoting the Reformation both in Geneva and throughout Europe.", "timestamp": 1656827748, "digest": "-n8tI6ROe8agkxGBLsUw8UStXZIBJuRCs7LZWjF-BdI", "contributor": "0x3514ba749D7d718a96033d2576d6C106DffFd5cb"}

He was the longest-serving holder of the office since the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation), and the first to retire from it.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh to a Scottish [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian) family, Davidson was educated at [Harrow School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School), where he became an Anglican, and at [Trinity College, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Oxford), where he was largely untouched by the arguments and debates between adherents of the [high-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-church) and [low-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-church) factions of the [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England). He was [ordained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination) in 1874, and, after a brief spell as a [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate), he became [chaplain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain) and secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury, [Archibald Campbell Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Campbell_Tait), in which post he became a confidant of [Queen Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria).

In 1903 he succeeded [Frederick Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Temple) as Archbishop of Canterbury, and remained in office until his retirement in November 1928.\n\nDavidson was conciliatory by nature, and spent much time throughout his term of office striving to keep the Church together in the face of deep and sometimes acrimonious divisions between [evangelicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Anglicanism) and [Anglo-Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Catholics). Under his leadership the Church gained some independence from state control, but his efforts to modernise the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)* were frustrated by Parliament.\n\nThough cautious about bringing the Church into domestic party politics, Davidson did not shy away from larger political issues: he played a key role in the passage of the reforming [Parliament Act 1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Act_1911); urged moderation on both sides in the conflict over Irish independence; campaigned against perceived immoral methods of warfare in the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) and led efforts to resolve the national crisis of the [1926 General Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1926_United_Kingdom_general_strike).

When the [National Association of Base Ball Players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Base_Ball_Players) (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' [bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field#Specifications) should be 90 feet (27 m) apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \"bound rule\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as [outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)). He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)*; by 1993, researcher [John Thorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thorn) had written about Adams' role.

Researchers have called Adams the creator of the [shortstop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop) position, which he used to field short throws from [outfielders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder). In addition to his playing career, Adams manufactured baseballs and oversaw [bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat) production; he also occasionally acted as an [umpire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)).\n\nFrom 1847 to 1861, the Knickerbockers selected Adams as their president six times, and as a vice president, treasurer, or director in six other years. As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-[inning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning) games. When the [National Association of Base Ball Players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Base_Ball_Players) (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' [bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field#Specifications) should be 90 feet (27 m) apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \"bound rule\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as [outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)). He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)*; by 1993, researcher [John Thorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thorn) had written about Adams' role. Other historians have given him credit for helping to develop the sport, and Thorn has called Adams \"first among the Fathers of Baseball\".[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Adams#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThorn19937-1)\n\nA graduate of [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University) and [Harvard Medical School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School), Adams began working in the medical field in the late 1830s, and practiced in New York City during his time as a member of the Knickerbockers. In 1865, he left medicine and later became a bank president and member of the [Connecticut legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_House_of_Representatives).

He was the longest-serving holder of the office since the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation), and the first to retire from it.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh to a Scottish [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian) family, Davidson was educated at [Harrow School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School), where he became an Anglican, and at [Trinity College, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Oxford), where he was largely untouched by the arguments and debates between adherents of the [high-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-church) and [low-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-church) factions of the [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England). He was [ordained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination) in 1874, and, after a brief spell as a [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate), he became [chaplain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain) and secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury, [Archibald Campbell Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Campbell_Tait), in which post he became a confidant of [Queen Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria). He rose through the Church hierarchy, becoming [Dean of Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_of_Windsor) (1883), [Bishop of Rochester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Rochester) (1891) and [Bishop of Winchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Winchester) (1895). In 1903 he succeeded [Frederick Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Temple) as Archbishop of Canterbury, and remained in office until his retirement in November 1928.\n\nDavidson was conciliatory by nature, and spent much time throughout his term of office striving to keep the Church together in the face of deep and sometimes acrimonious divisions between [evangelicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Anglicanism) and [Anglo-Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Catholics). Under his leadership the Church gained some independence from state control, but his efforts to modernise the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)* were frustrated by Parliament.\n\nThough cautious about bringing the Church into domestic party politics, Davidson did not shy away from larger political issues: he played a key role in the passage of the reforming [Parliament Act 1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Act_1911); urged moderation on both sides in the conflict over Irish independence; campaigned against perceived immoral methods of warfare in the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) and led efforts to resolve the national crisis of the [1926 General Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1926_United_Kingdom_general_strike). He was a consistent advocate of Christian unity, and worked, often closely, with other religious leaders throughout his primacy.

In first-class matches, he played for Middlesex and Cambridge University. A fast bowler and hard-hitting lower-order batsman, Allen later became an influential cricket administrator who held key positions in the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which effectively ruled English cricket at the time; he also served as chairman of the England selectors.\n\nAllen was born in Australia and grew up in England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he established a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he was on the verge of the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932–33, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.\n\nFrom 1933, Allen worked in the London Stock Exchange, which limited the amount of cricket he could play. Even so, he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936–37 tour of Australia, when the home team won 3–2 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play irregularly for Middlesex until 1939; after the Second World War, in which he worked in military intelligence, he played occasionally for Middlesex and other teams into the 1950s. He captained England in a final Test series in the West Indies in 1947–48. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was able to build up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he often scored runs when his team were under pressure.\n\nAs Allen's first-class career came to a close, he moved into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He was instrumental in the creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate illegal bowling actions. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the D'Oliveira affair, a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to Lord's, where he died, aged 87, in 1989.", "timestamp": 1656830029, "digest": "1I91Pf3tofN5bCFa0l_YnREkqc2dOvzHBhJd39NQ0VQ", "contributor": "0x08A6c9787C263337EeF7C241Eb6059B630430370"}

He helped build the case for the annulment of Henry's marriage to [Catherine of Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon), which was one of the causes of the separation of the English Church from union with the [Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See). Along with [Thomas Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cromwell), he supported the principle of [royal supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Supremacy), in which the king was considered sovereign over the Church within his realm.\n\nDuring Cranmer's tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury, he was responsible for establishing the first doctrinal and liturgical structures of the reformed [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England). Under Henry's rule, Cranmer did not make many radical changes in the Church, due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers. He published the first officially authorised [vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular) service, the *[Exhortation and Litany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhortation_and_Litany)*.\n\nWhen Edward came to the throne, Cranmer was able to promote major reforms. He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*, a complete liturgy for the English Church. With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge, he changed doctrine or discipline in areas such as the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist), [clerical celibacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerical_celibacy), the role of [images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_image) in places of worship, and the [veneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneration) of saints. Cranmer [promulgated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promulgate) the new doctrines through the Prayer Book, the *[Homilies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_Homilies)* and other publications.\n\nAfter the accession of the [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic) Mary I, Cranmer was put on trial for treason and [heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy).

This involved many negotiations with the powerful religious institutions and secular authorities which had acquired control of the revenue that would normally have been the entitlement of Clement's bishopric. The negotiations proved difficult, forcing Clement to visit the [papal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope) [court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_curia) in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome). While not achieving all of his aims, Clement succeeded in saving the bishopric from relocation to [Inchaffray Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchaffray_Abbey). He also regained enough revenue to begin work on the new [Dunblane Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_Cathedral).\n\nHe faced a similar challenge with the impoverished [bishopric of Argyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Argyll) in the 1240s.

Branham was the first American [deliverance minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance_ministry) to successfully campaign in Europe; his ministry reached global audiences with major campaigns held in North America, Europe, Africa, and India.\n\nBranham claimed that he had received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry and launching his campaigning career in mid-1946. His fame rapidly spread as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings. His ministry spawned many emulators and set the broader healing revival that later became the modern [charismatic movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_movement) in motion. At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and \"the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation\".[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarrell197839-8) From 1955, Branham's campaigning and popularity began to decline as the [Pentecostal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostalism) churches began to withdraw their support from the healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons. By 1960, Branham transitioned into a teaching ministry.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who followed doctrinal teachings which are known as the [Full Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Gospel) tradition, Branham developed an alternative [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology) which was primarily a mixture of [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinist) and [Arminian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminian) doctrines, and had a heavy focus on [dispensationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism) and Branham's own unique [eschatological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology) views. While widely accepting the [restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorationism) doctrine he espoused during the healing revival, his divergent post-revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his charismatic and Pentecostal contemporaries, who subsequently disavowed many of the doctrines as \"revelatory madness\".[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoriarty199255-9) His racial teachings on [serpent seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_seed) and his belief that membership in a [Christian denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination) was connected to the [mark of the beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_beast) alienated many of his former supporters. His closest followers, however, accepted his sermons as oral [scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text) and refer to his teachings as The Message. Despite Branham's objections, some followers of his teachings placed him at the center of a [cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) during his final years. Branham claimed that he had converted over one million people during his career. His teachings continue to be promoted by the William Branham Evangelistic Association, which reported that about 2 million people received its material in 2018. Branham died following a car accident in 1965.\n\nThroughout his healing revivals, Branham was accused of committing [fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud) by investigative news reporters, fellow ministers, host churches, and governmental agencies. Numerous people pronounced healed died shortly thereafter, investigators discovered evidence suggesting miracles may have been staged, and Branham was found to have significantly embellished and falsified numerous stories he presented to his audiences as fact. Branham faced legal problems as a result of his practices. The governments of South Africa and Norway intervened in order to stop his healing campaigns in their countries. In the United States, Branham was charged with [tax evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion) for failing to account for the donations received through his ministry; admitting his liability, he settled the case out of court. The news media has linked Branham to multiple notorious figures. Branham was baptized and ordained a minister by [Roy Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Elonzo_Davis), the National [Imperial Wizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Wizard) (leader) of the [Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Ku_Klux_Klan); the two men maintained a lifelong relationship.

When Conwell removed and excommunicated [William Hogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hogan_(priest)), a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process and recalled him to Rome.\n\nAlthough he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [coadjutor bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coadjutor_bishop), [Francis Kenrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Kenrick). He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese.

He was the longest-serving holder of the office since the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation), and the first to retire from it.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh to a Scottish [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian) family, Davidson was educated at [Harrow School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School), where he became an Anglican, and at [Trinity College, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Oxford), where he was largely untouched by the arguments and debates between adherents of the [high-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-church) and [low-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-church) factions of the [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England).

He was also an early patron of [Thomas Becket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Becket), and gave the young cleric an office in his diocese early in Becket's career. Although shown favour by [King Stephen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_of_England), including the right to a [mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_(facility)), Chesney was present at the coronation of [King Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England) in 1154 and went on to serve Henry as a royal justice. Around 1160, Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with [St Albans Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans_Abbey) in the diocese of Lincoln, over his right as bishop to supervise the abbey. The dispute was eventually settled when the abbey granted Chesney land in return for his relinquishing any right to oversee St Albans.\n\nChesney was active in his diocese; more than 240 documents relating to his episcopal career survive. They show him mediating disputes between religious houses and granting exemptions and rights in his diocese.

Bucer was originally a member of the [Dominican Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order), but after meeting and being influenced by [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) in 1518 he arranged for his [monastic vows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_vows) to be annulled. He then began to work for the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation), with the support of [Franz von Sickingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Sickingen).\n\nBucer's efforts to reform the church in [Wissembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wissembourg) resulted in his [excommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication) from the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church), and he was forced to flee to Strasbourg. There he joined a team of reformers which included [Matthew Zell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Zell), [Wolfgang Capito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Capito), and [Caspar Hedio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Hedio). He acted as a mediator between the two leading reformers, Martin Luther and [Huldrych Zwingli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldrych_Zwingli), who differed on the doctrine of the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist). Later, Bucer sought agreement on common articles of faith such as the [Tetrapolitan Confession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapolitan_Confession) and the [Wittenberg Concord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittenberg_Concord), working closely with [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) on the latter.\n\nBucer believed that the [Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholics) in the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire) could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by [Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the [Schmalkaldic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmalkaldic_War) and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the [Augsburg Interim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg_Interim), which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.\n\nIn 1549, Bucer was exiled to England, where, under the guidance of [Thomas Cranmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer), he was able to influence the second revision of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*. He died in [Cambridge, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_England), at the age of 59. Although his ministry did not lead to the formation of a new denomination, many Protestant denominations have claimed him as one of their own. He is remembered as an early pioneer of [ecumenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenism).", "timestamp": 1656826696, "digest": "1qT5odKQctR-ftzjO3gQ17vC-cwX6mLxHrI8Hi5zET4", "contributor": "0x0cfF56FD246E455A8B19359241C4329B08893b33"}

He helped build the case for the annulment of Henry's marriage to [Catherine of Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon), which was one of the causes of the separation of the English Church from union with the [Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See). Along with [Thomas Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cromwell), he supported the principle of [royal supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Supremacy), in which the king was considered sovereign over the Church within his realm.\n\nDuring Cranmer's tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury, he was responsible for establishing the first doctrinal and liturgical structures of the reformed [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England). Under Henry's rule, Cranmer did not make many radical changes in the Church, due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers. He published the first officially authorised [vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular) service, the *[Exhortation and Litany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhortation_and_Litany)*.\n\nWhen Edward came to the throne, Cranmer was able to promote major reforms. He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*, a complete liturgy for the English Church. With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge, he changed doctrine or discipline in areas such as the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist), [clerical celibacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerical_celibacy), the role of [images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_image) in places of worship, and the [veneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneration) of saints. Cranmer [promulgated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promulgate) the new doctrines through the Prayer Book, the *[Homilies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_Homilies)* and other publications.\n\nAfter the accession of the [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic) Mary I, Cranmer was put on trial for treason and [heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy). Imprisoned for over two years and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several [recantations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recantation) and apparently reconciled himself with the Catholic Church. While this would have normally absolved him, Mary wanted him executed, and, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a [heretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heretic) to Catholics and a [martyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr) for the principles of the English Reformation.

{"id": "MULNMj9Bitm3Mq_gxrMrHsS1ZU8RvfxFwLKp1u__LPo", "title": "Ethereum Upgrade — EIP 1559 - Woodstock Fund - Medium", "body": "## Introduction\n\nDecentralized technology has made great strides in the last decade, slowly gaining wider acceptance in the global consciousness. A big challenge remains in the growth of this sector, the process of staging upgrades. In a centralized company, the decisions are taken by the team internally, and the general public does not have a say in the growth and direction of said company. However, this hurts a decentralized protocol like Ethereum as millions of people are running Ethereum nodes and developing on the network which these changes would significantly impact.\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals or EIPs are a great tool to grow and improve the protocol in a decentralized manner. “Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are standards specifying potential new features or processes for Ethereum. EIPs contain the technical specifications for the proposed changes and act as the source of truth for the community.”\n\n## How does an EIP work?\n\nAny user can submit an EIP by creating a pull request to Ethereum’s EIP [Github repository](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs), and highlighting the core changes and the intended effect in a standard predetermined [format](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1). Once an EIP is proposed, it goes through a series of iterations and changes proposed by the members of the Ethereum community. It is then reviewed and the core Ethereum developers encode an EIP into the new version of the Ethereum client as part of a future [hard fork](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*L7ArPFvNJMiyijwu)\n\nGenerally speaking, this process allows for members within the community to contribute to the growth of the protocol, hence allowing for a change in a truly decentralized manner.\n\nHowever, certain EIPs are disputed after getting approval. One such case is EIP-1559, one of the most controversial EIPs ever introduced. It was heavily contested by the Ethereum miner community.\n\n## Current state of Ethereum\n\nBefore exploring the improvements planned for the Ethereum network, we must first understand the current state of affairs when it comes to a few important features of the Ethereum network, such as volatility of gas fees, its auction mechanism as well as the transaction fees eclipsing block rewards.\n\n## Gas Auction Mechanism\n\nA block has a limited amount of space in it. This cap is decided on the protocol level. Blockchains with bigger blocks can accommodate more transactions, but the cost of running and maintaining the blockchain grows significantly, which requires more sophisticated equipment that in turn hurts the level of decentralization of the network. Due to limited block sizes and a network that supports only 15 transactions every second, the Ethereum network tends to get very congested. To get the valuable real estate of the blocks on the Ethereum network, participants in the network need to incentivize miners to include their transactions in a block.\n\nEach transaction (operation on the Ethereum network) requires a “gas” fee to be paid to ensure that the miners are compensated for the computational effort they put into verifying these transactions. Since the exact amount of gas required differs from time to time based on the amount of transactions taking place and the number of miners available, each transaction is given a “gas limit” stating how much the sender is willing to spend on the transaction being processed.\n\nThis mechanism allows miners to reject transactions that have a gas limit below what is necessary to complete the transaction and process those that have been allotted enough.\n\nEthereum follows a “First price” auction mechanism wherein each sender enters a bid of the amount of gas that they are willing to pay for a transaction, and miners pick transactions that are desirable to be entered into the next block. Since there is not much transparency as to how much other users are paying in the form of gas per transaction, the sender often ends up paying more than what is necessary. A lot of this is considered a side-effect of the unpredictable nature of the gas fees on Ethereum.\n\n## Volatility of Gas Fees\n\nThe volatility in gas fees creates a bad user experience, and transactions sometimes get stuck for multiple hours and sometimes even days, especially at times when the network is congested. On the 1st of September 2020, Ethereum miners ended up earning over $500,000 USD in just one hour, which was an all-time high as far as gas fees were concerned. While this meant that miners earned handsomely for their efforts, it also meant that users had to pay ridiculously high fees for their transactions, which led to longer wait times, congestion on the network, and an increased number of unconfirmed transactions. During this month in 2020, for the first time, miners [earned more](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/79452/ethereum-miner-revenue-september-gas-fees) from transactions (gas) fees at $172 million in comparison to the $150 million they earned from block rewards.\n\nA blockchain that relies primarily on transaction fees and not block rewards leads to instability in the market and incentivizes the creation of “sister blocks” and opens the network up to other mining attacks. With only transaction fees, the variance of the block reward is very high due to the variable transaction fees in a given block, and it becomes attractive to fork a “wealthy” block to “steal” the rewards therein. This not only raised concerns about the stability, and scalability of the network but also became a potential obstacle to the DeFi boom which was putting more transactions on the network than ever before.\n\nHere’s a look at the average transaction fees on Ethereum over the last year, expressed in USD\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BAoFesqdkvd24-uwdQDl0Q.png)\n\n(Source: Ycharts; [Ethereum Average Transaction Fee](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee))\n\n## What is EIP 1559?\n\nEIP-1559 would replace the auction system of the gas price with a new transaction price mechanism based on gas rates. This would introduce a concept of base fee — a dynamic rate of conversion from gas to[ gwei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gwei-ethereum.asp) — into the Ethereum protocol, which would vary according to the activity on the network.\n\nEIP-1559 introduced three new changes to Ethereum in order to combat these problems -\n\n1. The gas limit will be increased to 15M gas from 30M gas. The size of blocks will be adjusted dynamically based on the utilization of the network, and allow block sizes to float from 0M to 30M gas without any disruption or lag. The gas limit pre-EIP-1559 will serve as the target block size. The target block size will serve as the equilibrium point that the network wants to maintain. If block sizes are below the target block size, the network is underutilized, and the base fees are decreased. Similarly, if the network is congested, the block size will be higher than the target block size, and the base fees will be increased.\n2. The structure of the transaction fees will be changed and will include two components, a base fee, and a tip (optional). The base fees will be calculated based on the gas cost of the previous block and the target block size, as explained later.\n3. The base fees collected every block will be burnt, and the tip fees (optional) will be awarded to the miners, to incentivize the miners for including a particular transaction in a given block.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1236/0\\*f-hcpoJ0Pl1UXc5H)\n\n## Impact of EIP 1559\n\nEIP-1559 will make Ethereum’s fee market more efficient and improve the user experience. It will help in having supply pressure, gas price stability, and optimized block sizes. EIP-1559 makes Ethereum & web3.0 more usable and frictionless. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n## Simpler gas fee estimation\n\nMost interactions on any web3.0 application are transactions. And every transaction involves paying a gas fee. Thus, the gas fee experience is a major factor for the whole web3.0 experience. And currently, the gas fee experience is frustrating and painful. The crux of the problem is that gas fee estimation is really hard. Users need to constantly predict the gas fees, set it on their wallets, and hope the transaction goes through. Many of them end up failing altogether but still cost valuable ETH. And if the transaction is successful, the user may end up overpaying for gas.\n\nEIP-1559’s pièce de résistance is it’s easier gas fee estimation. Users no longer need to constantly estimate their gas fees. And suffer from pending & failed transactions. Post EIP-1559, the user simply needs to set the maximum they are willing to pay for a transaction. And they can be reliably certain that their transaction will go through. They can also be assured that they won’t overpay for gas. This improved mechanism will make the gas fee experience far less daunting for crypto newbies as well.\n\nMoreover, DApps & wallets can also provide a better transaction experience to their users by being able to easily estimate the gas price to recommend to the user.\n\n## Faster Transaction time\n\nFrom the point of view of the user, everything from clicking the ‘submit transaction’ to getting the confirmation counts as ‘transaction time’. One factor is of course the TPS (transaction per second) of the Ethereum network. But the other contributing factor is the time taken for the transaction to get included in the next block. Currently, if the gas price estimate is low, a ton of transactions stay pending for a long time. This is really frustrating, especially for new crypto users, who have no idea why this is happening. To them, Ethereum transactions take painfully long and are a terrible experience.\n\nWhile EIP-1559 won’t affect the TPS, it will make it easier and faster to get your transaction included in the next block. As mentioned above, the user can easily estimate the max gas they need to pay to be certain their transactions will go through. The DApp, or relayer networks such as Biconomy, can also perform the gas estimation for the user more reliably and ensure all transactions are included in the next block.\n\nMoreover, post EIP-1559 blocks will be kept half full on average. This is to ensure that during higher congested periods, blocks can effectively double their capacity. Thus, there would be a lower number of pending transactions as they would get included even in times of high traffic. And in theory, even if a transaction is pending, it will eventually go through quickly. Both these points will over time ensure faster successful transactions that will improve the UX.\n\n## Eliminate overpaying for gas\n\nWhile EIP-1559 isn’t designed specifically to reduce gas costs, it will definitely ensure users don’t overpay for gas. Currently, during periods when blocks are full and the network is clogged, users may end up paying very high gas prices to get their transactions in the next block. Moreover, as discussed, gas prices are currently hard to estimate during highly congested times. Thus, a user may overestimate by a huge margin in fear of a failed transaction. And end up paying way more for gas than what was required.\n\nPost EIP-1559, even if you overestimate by an enormous margin, you will only pay the fee required to get included in the block. The difference will be refunded back to you! Thus, if the user sets the max acceptable gas as 500 gwei and their transaction gets included in a block with a base fee of 10 gwei, they will only pay 10 gwei. Currently, if they estimate as 500 gwei and the transaction could have been included at 10 gwei, they would still pay the full 500 gwei. Thus, users will never overpay for gas. They can set a high gas estimate to ensure a quick transaction while being relaxed that they won’t be penalized for over-estimation and still just pay the base fee + miner’s tip.\n\n## Lower Issuance\n\nTo combat the instability of blockchains with transaction fees greater than issuance, the base fees are burnt. Even though miner revenue is greatly decreased, it is necessary for the long term to combat the issues of forking and creating sister blocks. This is also one of the strongest changes to the tokenomics of Ethereum. The burning mechanism removes ETH from the circulating supply and the value flows back to the Ethereum holders.\n\n## Economic Analysis\n\nLet us analyze the changes in the token model of ETH post-EIP-1559 -\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*tDthFLeqzqQ7c9HHoasjNg.png)\n\nBase fee will vary in accordance with the utilization of the block that is being generated. Each block will have the capacity to incorporate 15 million gas. In times of high volume, this can increase up to a maximum of 30 million gas. The base fee formula depends on the utilization of the network and the fee of the previous block.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*bI568pHNVpb5qJRt)\n\nWe can clearly see that even if the network is being utilized at a hundred percent, i.e. all the blocks are at full capacity ( previous-block-size = 2 \\* target-block-size), the max change in base fees with each block will only be 12.5%. This improves user experience as the transaction fees can be reliably predicted, and a user can provide the right amount of gas for a given transaction. Pre EIP-1559, the gas fees would have rocketed suddenly, and user transactions with insufficient gas fees would have been stuck for a few hours/days.\n\nDespite adding the base fee and tip parameters, the new transactions are still backward compatible and will work with the legacy transaction functions.\n\n## Will ETH become deflationary?\n\nThe fact of the matter is that no one can predict whether ETH supply will deflate, but we can take estimates. We get a deflationary asset when burning outgrows the minting of the asset. Let’s dive into both these mechanisms:\n\n**Minting**\n\nWe are currently minting [13,600 ETH daily](https://etherscan.io/chart/blockreward) from block rewards to miners. These figures are unlikely to change after EIP-1599.\n\n**Burning**\n\nAs the base fee is burned, the amount of ETH burned is highly dependent on the network congestion or rather block utilization of ETH.\n\nSo the questions remain — *How much can we truly burn*? \\*Would it be enough to make it deflationary? \\*The two primary variables to calculate the burn are Network transaction fees and Base to total fee ratio.\n\nWhile we can estimate the network tx fees based on historical data, the base fee to total fee ratio is anyone’s guess until EIP-1559 goes live and generates substantial data. As of the time of writing this article, Ethereum network participants are spending [3k ETH daily](https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee) on gas.\n\nIf we assume daily transactions to be around 3k/day and the base fee to be 40% of the total transaction fee then 40% of 3k = 1.2k ETH will be burned daily. While this is indeed a high amount, it is nowhere close to the ETH supply that is minted on block rewards. Hence, it is unlikely that ETH will be deflationary as more ETH can be minted than burned. Further, in the event that the network is extremely burdened for a long period of time, and the base fees are extremely high, users are economically incentivized to wait for the network to cool down.\n\nMoreover, as Ethereum scaling solutions have started to gain traction, we anticipate activity to move towards the scaling solutions while the protocols derive security from Ethereum and maintain regular checkpoints. We witnessed a similar [decline](https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee) in network congestion and transaction fee as Polygon started gaining traction as a sidechain.\n\n## Can ETH 2.0 change the game?\n\nAs we have established the unlikely scenario that ETH will deflate post-EIP-1559 because of PoW (Proof of Work) rewards outpacing the burning of the base fee, the scenario will definitely be different as Ethereum transitions to a PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus with the merge of Beacon chain and Ethereum mainnet that is [scheduled](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/) in 2022.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ghvoucz6cAv4RRYK)\n\nMonthly Net Issuance — Projections\n\nPoS rewards, unlike PoW, are lesser and hence, have limited inflationary pressure on ETH. As shown by the beacon chain [staking rewards page](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/), ETH 2.0 is estimated to generate \\~1.3k ETH daily. If the total transaction fees remain the same as the current system, then we can expect very low inflation and even deflation on ETH!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Rw-5xR-qlBd9M7aN)\n\nETH 2.0 Staking APR Projections\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe EIP-1559 Upgrade is likely to go live on 4th August 2021 between 13:00 UTC and 17:00 UTC, with block 12,965,000. The base fee mechanism hints at the protocol’s direction in trying to take some of the power away from the miners. The EIP-1559 update is paving the way for future progress regardless of whether it turns out to be bullish or bearish for the price in the short term. Ethereum continues to be the most talked about blockchain among its peers and with the recent London Upgrade and ETH 2.0 also under the works, it is likely to be the undisputed Layer 1 blockchain in the near future.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*i4z97794yjrReXyYGTc3kQ.png)\n\n", "timestamp": 1656896869, "digest": "Bc8hcSZJu9ct3Rsx8pUmI8otdyWyyVvVttVSu5HMFj4", "contributor": "0x2d6cd52FAFC326a2CBd93bCb686615Fec6E37BCB"}

A [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church) priest and [Jesuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus) for much of his life, he later left the Jesuit order to marry, and subsequently left the Catholic Church to become an [Episcopal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_(United_States)) priest. Born at [Watervliet, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watervliet,_New_York), he was the son of [David Hillhouse Buel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hillhouse_Buel_(soldier)), a distinguished [Union Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army) officer, and descended from numerous prominent [New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England) families. While studying at [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University), he formed an acquaintance with priest [Michael J.

He took charge of the university in 1905, after the sudden removal of the president. In this role, he promoted [intramural sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramural_sports), oversaw construction of Ryan Gymnasium, and reformed the curriculum and university governance. He also instituted strict discipline and curtailed [intercollegiate athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_athletics_in_the_United_States), stoking fierce opposition from the student body and their parents, which resulted in his removal by the Jesuit superiors in 1908. Buel then performed pastoral work and taught for several years, before resigning from the Jesuit order in 1912 and secretly marrying in [Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut). When word reached [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.), his former Jesuit colleagues publicly condemned him, and the media claimed his actions resulted in his [excommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication_(Catholic_Church)) *[latae sententiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latae_sententiae)*.\n\nBuel resumed teaching in a secular capacity in New England, but after his marriage, he lived at times in poverty despite his wife's considerable inheritance.

Bucer was originally a member of the [Dominican Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order), but after meeting and being influenced by [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) in 1518 he arranged for his [monastic vows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_vows) to be annulled. He then began to work for the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation), with the support of [Franz von Sickingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Sickingen).\n\nBucer's efforts to reform the church in [Wissembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wissembourg) resulted in his [excommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication) from the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church), and he was forced to flee to Strasbourg. There he joined a team of reformers which included [Matthew Zell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Zell), [Wolfgang Capito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Capito), and [Caspar Hedio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Hedio). He acted as a mediator between the two leading reformers, Martin Luther and [Huldrych Zwingli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldrych_Zwingli), who differed on the doctrine of the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist). Later, Bucer sought agreement on common articles of faith such as the [Tetrapolitan Confession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapolitan_Confession) and the [Wittenberg Concord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittenberg_Concord), working closely with [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) on the latter.\n\nBucer believed that the [Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholics) in the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire) could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by [Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the [Schmalkaldic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmalkaldic_War) and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the [Augsburg Interim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg_Interim), which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.\n\nIn 1549, Bucer was exiled to England, where, under the guidance of [Thomas Cranmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer), he was able to influence the second revision of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*. He died in [Cambridge, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_England), at the age of 59.

Branham was the first American [deliverance minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance_ministry) to successfully campaign in Europe; his ministry reached global audiences with major campaigns held in North America, Europe, Africa, and India.\n\nBranham claimed that he had received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry and launching his campaigning career in mid-1946. His fame rapidly spread as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings. His ministry spawned many emulators and set the broader healing revival that later became the modern [charismatic movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_movement) in motion. At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and \"the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation\".[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarrell197839-8) From 1955, Branham's campaigning and popularity began to decline as the [Pentecostal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostalism) churches began to withdraw their support from the healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons. By 1960, Branham transitioned into a teaching ministry.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who followed doctrinal teachings which are known as the [Full Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Gospel) tradition, Branham developed an alternative [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology) which was primarily a mixture of [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinist) and [Arminian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminian) doctrines, and had a heavy focus on [dispensationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism) and Branham's own unique [eschatological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology) views. While widely accepting the [restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorationism) doctrine he espoused during the healing revival, his divergent post-revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his charismatic and Pentecostal contemporaries, who subsequently disavowed many of the doctrines as \"revelatory madness\".[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoriarty199255-9) His racial teachings on [serpent seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_seed) and his belief that membership in a [Christian denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination) was connected to the [mark of the beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_beast) alienated many of his former supporters. His closest followers, however, accepted his sermons as oral [scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text) and refer to his teachings as The Message. Despite Branham's objections, some followers of his teachings placed him at the center of a [cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) during his final years. Branham claimed that he had converted over one million people during his career. His teachings continue to be promoted by the William Branham Evangelistic Association, which reported that about 2 million people received its material in 2018. Branham died following a car accident in 1965.\n\nThroughout his healing revivals, Branham was accused of committing [fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud) by investigative news reporters, fellow ministers, host churches, and governmental agencies. Numerous people pronounced healed died shortly thereafter, investigators discovered evidence suggesting miracles may have been staged, and Branham was found to have significantly embellished and falsified numerous stories he presented to his audiences as fact. Branham faced legal problems as a result of his practices. The governments of South Africa and Norway intervened in order to stop his healing campaigns in their countries. In the United States, Branham was charged with [tax evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion) for failing to account for the donations received through his ministry; admitting his liability, he settled the case out of court. The news media has linked Branham to multiple notorious figures. Branham was baptized and ordained a minister by [Roy Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Elonzo_Davis), the National [Imperial Wizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Wizard) (leader) of the [Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Ku_Klux_Klan); the two men maintained a lifelong relationship.

A native of [Shropshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shropshire), he served as a minor royal official before entering into the service of Prince Edward, the future King [Edward I of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England). When Edward went on the [Eighth Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Crusade) in 1270, Burnell stayed in England to secure the prince's interests.

King Henry sent him on a number of diplomatic missions and finally rewarded him with the bishopric of Lincoln in 1183. He did not remain there long, for he was [translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(ecclesiastical)) to Rouen in late 1184.\n\nWhen [Richard I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England), King Henry's son, became king in 1189, Coutances absolved Richard for his rebellion against his father and invested him as Duke of Normandy.

Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar's expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title. He remained in the office until late 1193, when he was summoned to Germany by the king, who was being held in captivity there. Coutances became a hostage for the final payment of Richard's ransom on the king's release in February 1194.\n\nCoutances took no further part in English government after returning from Germany. Instead he became involved in Norman affairs, including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of [Andely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Andelys) manor, an archiepiscopal property that Richard desired as a fortress. Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe. Richard went on to build the [castle of Gaillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_Gaillard) on the former archiepiscopal manor.

He was a principal figure in the development of the system of [Christian theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_theology) later called [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism), including its doctrines of [predestination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination) and of God's [absolute sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monergism) in the [salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation) of the human soul from death and [eternal damnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation).

He also exchanged cordial and supportive letters with many reformers, including [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) and [Heinrich Bullinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Bullinger). In addition to his seminal *[Institutes of the Christian Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutes_of_the_Christian_Religion)*, Calvin wrote commentaries on most books of the Bible, [confessional documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_of_faith), and various other theological treatises.\n\nCalvin was originally trained as a [humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Humanism) lawyer. He broke from the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church) around 1530. After religious tensions erupted in widespread deadly violence against [Protestant Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Christians) in France, Calvin fled to [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel), Switzerland, where in 1536 he published the first edition of the *Institutes*. In that same year, Calvin was recruited by Frenchman [William Farel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Farel) to join the Reformation in [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva), where he regularly preached sermons throughout the week. However, the governing council of the city resisted the implementation of their ideas, and both men were expelled. At the invitation of [Martin Bucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bucer), Calvin proceeded to [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg), where he became the minister of a church of French refugees. He continued to support the reform movement in Geneva, and in 1541 he was invited back to lead the church of the city.\n\nFollowing his return, Calvin introduced new forms of church government and [liturgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_liturgy), despite opposition from several powerful families in the city who tried to curb his authority. During this period, [Michael Servetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Servetus), a Spaniard regarded by both Roman Catholics and Protestants as having a [heretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_heresy) view of the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), arrived in Geneva. He was denounced by Calvin and [burned at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned_at_the_stake) for heresy by the city council.

As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-[inning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning) games. When the [National Association of Base Ball Players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Base_Ball_Players) (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' [bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field#Specifications) should be 90 feet (27 m) apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \"bound rule\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as [outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)). He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)*; by 1993, researcher [John Thorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thorn) had written about Adams' role.

In first-class matches, he played for Middlesex and Cambridge University. A fast bowler and hard-hitting lower-order batsman, Allen later became an influential cricket administrator who held key positions in the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which effectively ruled English cricket at the time; he also served as chairman of the England selectors.\n\nAllen was born in Australia and grew up in England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he established a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he was on the verge of the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932–33, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.\n\nFrom 1933, Allen worked in the London Stock Exchange, which limited the amount of cricket he could play. Even so, he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936–37 tour of Australia, when the home team won 3–2 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play irregularly for Middlesex until 1939; after the Second World War, in which he worked in military intelligence, he played occasionally for Middlesex and other teams into the 1950s. He captained England in a final Test series in the West Indies in 1947–48. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was able to build up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he often scored runs when his team were under pressure.\n\nAs Allen's first-class career came to a close, he moved into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He was instrumental in the creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate illegal bowling actions. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the D'Oliveira affair, a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to Lord's, where he died, aged 87, in 1989.", "timestamp": 1656830029, "digest": "1I91Pf3tofN5bCFa0l_YnREkqc2dOvzHBhJd39NQ0VQ", "contributor": "0x08A6c9787C263337EeF7C241Eb6059B630430370"}

Davidson strongly protested his innocence and to raise funds for his reinstatement campaign he exhibited himself in a barrel on the [Blackpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool) seafront. He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature, and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside spectacular.\n\nBefore his ordination in 1903, Davidson had a brief career on the London stage as an entertainer. As a young [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate) he became actively involved with charitable activity among London's poor, an interest he maintained following his appointment in 1906 as [rector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)) of the rural [Norfolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk) parish of [Stiffkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffkey). After the First World War, in which he served as a naval chaplain, he devoted himself primarily to his London work. Styling himself the \"Prostitutes' Padre\",[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Davidson#cite_note-1) his declared mission was the rescue of young girls he considered in danger of falling into vice. In this role he approached and befriended hundreds of girls and, although there was little direct evidence of improper behaviour, Davidson was frequently found in compromising situations. His neglect of his local duties over many years strained relations with his parishioners in Stiffkey; after a formal complaint, the [Bishop of Norwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Norwich) instituted disciplinary proceedings through a [consistory court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistory_court). Davidson's defence was severely compromised by his eccentric conduct, and was damaged beyond repair when the prosecution produced a photograph of him with a near-naked teenage girl.\n\nDavidson's later career as a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His attempts at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles that he had not been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.", "timestamp": 1656828826, "digest": "VfdSzOoh_tJ44i2gxqWieujH_SZToTjHw4HmTR_IXAk", "contributor": "0x67237Ebe4DB2408d808b2D7141D45b3f5eAee216"}

As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-[inning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning) games. When the [National Association of Base Ball Players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Base_Ball_Players) (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' [bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field#Specifications) should be 90 feet (27 m) apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \"bound rule\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as [outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)). He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)*; by 1993, researcher [John Thorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thorn) had written about Adams' role. Other historians have given him credit for helping to develop the sport, and Thorn has called Adams \"first among the Fathers of Baseball\".[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Adams#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThorn19937-1)\n\nA graduate of [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University) and [Harvard Medical School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School), Adams began working in the medical field in the late 1830s, and practiced in New York City during his time as a member of the Knickerbockers. In 1865, he left medicine and later became a bank president and member of the [Connecticut legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_House_of_Representatives).

He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature, and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside spectacular.\n\nBefore his ordination in 1903, Davidson had a brief career on the London stage as an entertainer. As a young [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate) he became actively involved with charitable activity among London's poor, an interest he maintained following his appointment in 1906 as [rector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)) of the rural [Norfolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk) parish of [Stiffkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffkey).

In first-class matches, he played for Middlesex and Cambridge University. A fast bowler and hard-hitting lower-order batsman, Allen later became an influential cricket administrator who held key positions in the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which effectively ruled English cricket at the time; he also served as chairman of the England selectors.\n\nAllen was born in Australia and grew up in England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he established a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he was on the verge of the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932–33, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.\n\nFrom 1933, Allen worked in the London Stock Exchange, which limited the amount of cricket he could play. Even so, he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936–37 tour of Australia, when the home team won 3–2 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play irregularly for Middlesex until 1939; after the Second World War, in which he worked in military intelligence, he played occasionally for Middlesex and other teams into the 1950s. He captained England in a final Test series in the West Indies in 1947–48. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was able to build up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he often scored runs when his team were under pressure.\n\nAs Allen's first-class career came to a close, he moved into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He was instrumental in the creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate illegal bowling actions. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the D'Oliveira affair, a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to Lord's, where he died, aged 87, in 1989.", "timestamp": 1656830029, "digest": "1I91Pf3tofN5bCFa0l_YnREkqc2dOvzHBhJd39NQ0VQ", "contributor": "0x08A6c9787C263337EeF7C241Eb6059B630430370"}

This involved many negotiations with the powerful religious institutions and secular authorities which had acquired control of the revenue that would normally have been the entitlement of Clement's bishopric. The negotiations proved difficult, forcing Clement to visit the [papal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope) [court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_curia) in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome). While not achieving all of his aims, Clement succeeded in saving the bishopric from relocation to [Inchaffray Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchaffray_Abbey).

{"id": "P16jeKG_jzhbQlvcPkT2lPDkbufx9YDjT2zfuLuOJms", "title": "Ethereum Upgrade — EIP 1559 - Woodstock Fund - Medium", "body": "## Introduction\n\nDecentralized technology has made great strides in the last decade, slowly gaining wider acceptance in the global consciousness. A big challenge remains in the growth of this sector, the process of staging upgrades. In a centralized company, the decisions are taken by the team internally, and the general public does not have a say in the growth and direction of said company. However, this hurts a decentralized protocol like Ethereum as millions of people are running Ethereum nodes and developing on the network which these changes would significantly impact.\n\nEthereum Improvement Proposals or EIPs are a great tool to grow and improve the protocol in a decentralized manner. “Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are standards specifying potential new features or processes for Ethereum. EIPs contain the technical specifications for the proposed changes and act as the source of truth for the community.”\n\n## How does an EIP work?\n\nAny user can submit an EIP by creating a pull request to Ethereum’s EIP [Github repository](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs), and highlighting the core changes and the intended effect in a standard predetermined [format](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1). Once an EIP is proposed, it goes through a series of iterations and changes proposed by the members of the Ethereum community. It is then reviewed and the core Ethereum developers encode an EIP into the new version of the Ethereum client as part of a future [hard fork](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*L7ArPFvNJMiyijwu)\n\nGenerally speaking, this process allows for members within the community to contribute to the growth of the protocol, hence allowing for a change in a truly decentralized manner.\n\nHowever, certain EIPs are disputed after getting approval. One such case is EIP-1559, one of the most controversial EIPs ever introduced. It was heavily contested by the Ethereum miner community.\n\n## Current state of Ethereum\n\nBefore exploring the improvements planned for the Ethereum network, we must first understand the current state of affairs when it comes to a few important features of the Ethereum network, such as volatility of gas fees, its auction mechanism as well as the transaction fees eclipsing block rewards.\n\n## Gas Auction Mechanism\n\nA block has a limited amount of space in it. This cap is decided on the protocol level. Blockchains with bigger blocks can accommodate more transactions, but the cost of running and maintaining the blockchain grows significantly, which requires more sophisticated equipment that in turn hurts the level of decentralization of the network. Due to limited block sizes and a network that supports only 15 transactions every second, the Ethereum network tends to get very congested. To get the valuable real estate of the blocks on the Ethereum network, participants in the network need to incentivize miners to include their transactions in a block.\n\nEach transaction (operation on the Ethereum network) requires a “gas” fee to be paid to ensure that the miners are compensated for the computational effort they put into verifying these transactions. Since the exact amount of gas required differs from time to time based on the amount of transactions taking place and the number of miners available, each transaction is given a “gas limit” stating how much the sender is willing to spend on the transaction being processed.\n\nThis mechanism allows miners to reject transactions that have a gas limit below what is necessary to complete the transaction and process those that have been allotted enough.\n\nEthereum follows a “First price” auction mechanism wherein each sender enters a bid of the amount of gas that they are willing to pay for a transaction, and miners pick transactions that are desirable to be entered into the next block. Since there is not much transparency as to how much other users are paying in the form of gas per transaction, the sender often ends up paying more than what is necessary. A lot of this is considered a side-effect of the unpredictable nature of the gas fees on Ethereum.\n\n## Volatility of Gas Fees\n\nThe volatility in gas fees creates a bad user experience, and transactions sometimes get stuck for multiple hours and sometimes even days, especially at times when the network is congested. On the 1st of September 2020, Ethereum miners ended up earning over $500,000 USD in just one hour, which was an all-time high as far as gas fees were concerned. While this meant that miners earned handsomely for their efforts, it also meant that users had to pay ridiculously high fees for their transactions, which led to longer wait times, congestion on the network, and an increased number of unconfirmed transactions. During this month in 2020, for the first time, miners [earned more](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/79452/ethereum-miner-revenue-september-gas-fees) from transactions (gas) fees at $172 million in comparison to the $150 million they earned from block rewards.\n\nA blockchain that relies primarily on transaction fees and not block rewards leads to instability in the market and incentivizes the creation of “sister blocks” and opens the network up to other mining attacks. With only transaction fees, the variance of the block reward is very high due to the variable transaction fees in a given block, and it becomes attractive to fork a “wealthy” block to “steal” the rewards therein. This not only raised concerns about the stability, and scalability of the network but also became a potential obstacle to the DeFi boom which was putting more transactions on the network than ever before.\n\nHere’s a look at the average transaction fees on Ethereum over the last year, expressed in USD\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*BAoFesqdkvd24-uwdQDl0Q.png)\n\n(Source: Ycharts; [Ethereum Average Transaction Fee](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee))\n\n## What is EIP 1559?\n\nEIP-1559 would replace the auction system of the gas price with a new transaction price mechanism based on gas rates. This would introduce a concept of base fee — a dynamic rate of conversion from gas to[ gwei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gwei-ethereum.asp) — into the Ethereum protocol, which would vary according to the activity on the network.\n\nEIP-1559 introduced three new changes to Ethereum in order to combat these problems -\n\n1. The gas limit will be increased to 15M gas from 30M gas. The size of blocks will be adjusted dynamically based on the utilization of the network, and allow block sizes to float from 0M to 30M gas without any disruption or lag. The gas limit pre-EIP-1559 will serve as the target block size. The target block size will serve as the equilibrium point that the network wants to maintain. If block sizes are below the target block size, the network is underutilized, and the base fees are decreased. Similarly, if the network is congested, the block size will be higher than the target block size, and the base fees will be increased.\n2. The structure of the transaction fees will be changed and will include two components, a base fee, and a tip (optional). The base fees will be calculated based on the gas cost of the previous block and the target block size, as explained later.\n3. The base fees collected every block will be burnt, and the tip fees (optional) will be awarded to the miners, to incentivize the miners for including a particular transaction in a given block.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1236/0\\*f-hcpoJ0Pl1UXc5H)\n\n## Impact of EIP 1559\n\nEIP-1559 will make Ethereum’s fee market more efficient and improve the user experience. It will help in having supply pressure, gas price stability, and optimized block sizes. EIP-1559 makes Ethereum & web3.0 more usable and frictionless. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n## Simpler gas fee estimation\n\nMost interactions on any web3.0 application are transactions. And every transaction involves paying a gas fee. Thus, the gas fee experience is a major factor for the whole web3.0 experience. And currently, the gas fee experience is frustrating and painful. The crux of the problem is that gas fee estimation is really hard. Users need to constantly predict the gas fees, set it on their wallets, and hope the transaction goes through. Many of them end up failing altogether but still cost valuable ETH. And if the transaction is successful, the user may end up overpaying for gas.\n\nEIP-1559’s pièce de résistance is it’s easier gas fee estimation. Users no longer need to constantly estimate their gas fees. And suffer from pending & failed transactions. Post EIP-1559, the user simply needs to set the maximum they are willing to pay for a transaction. And they can be reliably certain that their transaction will go through. They can also be assured that they won’t overpay for gas. This improved mechanism will make the gas fee experience far less daunting for crypto newbies as well.\n\nMoreover, DApps & wallets can also provide a better transaction experience to their users by being able to easily estimate the gas price to recommend to the user.\n\n## Faster Transaction time\n\nFrom the point of view of the user, everything from clicking the ‘submit transaction’ to getting the confirmation counts as ‘transaction time’. One factor is of course the TPS (transaction per second) of the Ethereum network. But the other contributing factor is the time taken for the transaction to get included in the next block. Currently, if the gas price estimate is low, a ton of transactions stay pending for a long time. This is really frustrating, especially for new crypto users, who have no idea why this is happening. To them, Ethereum transactions take painfully long and are a terrible experience.\n\nWhile EIP-1559 won’t affect the TPS, it will make it easier and faster to get your transaction included in the next block. As mentioned above, the user can easily estimate the max gas they need to pay to be certain their transactions will go through. The DApp, or relayer networks such as Biconomy, can also perform the gas estimation for the user more reliably and ensure all transactions are included in the next block.\n\nMoreover, post EIP-1559 blocks will be kept half full on average. This is to ensure that during higher congested periods, blocks can effectively double their capacity. Thus, there would be a lower number of pending transactions as they would get included even in times of high traffic. And in theory, even if a transaction is pending, it will eventually go through quickly. Both these points will over time ensure faster successful transactions that will improve the UX.\n\n## Eliminate overpaying for gas\n\nWhile EIP-1559 isn’t designed specifically to reduce gas costs, it will definitely ensure users don’t overpay for gas. Currently, during periods when blocks are full and the network is clogged, users may end up paying very high gas prices to get their transactions in the next block. Moreover, as discussed, gas prices are currently hard to estimate during highly congested times. Thus, a user may overestimate by a huge margin in fear of a failed transaction. And end up paying way more for gas than what was required.\n\nPost EIP-1559, even if you overestimate by an enormous margin, you will only pay the fee required to get included in the block. The difference will be refunded back to you! Thus, if the user sets the max acceptable gas as 500 gwei and their transaction gets included in a block with a base fee of 10 gwei, they will only pay 10 gwei. Currently, if they estimate as 500 gwei and the transaction could have been included at 10 gwei, they would still pay the full 500 gwei. Thus, users will never overpay for gas. They can set a high gas estimate to ensure a quick transaction while being relaxed that they won’t be penalized for over-estimation and still just pay the base fee + miner’s tip.\n\n## Lower Issuance\n\nTo combat the instability of blockchains with transaction fees greater than issuance, the base fees are burnt. Even though miner revenue is greatly decreased, it is necessary for the long term to combat the issues of forking and creating sister blocks. This is also one of the strongest changes to the tokenomics of Ethereum. The burning mechanism removes ETH from the circulating supply and the value flows back to the Ethereum holders.\n\n## Economic Analysis\n\nLet us analyze the changes in the token model of ETH post-EIP-1559 -\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*tDthFLeqzqQ7c9HHoasjNg.png)\n\nBase fee will vary in accordance with the utilization of the block that is being generated. Each block will have the capacity to incorporate 15 million gas. In times of high volume, this can increase up to a maximum of 30 million gas. The base fee formula depends on the utilization of the network and the fee of the previous block.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*bI568pHNVpb5qJRt)\n\nWe can clearly see that even if the network is being utilized at a hundred percent, i.e. all the blocks are at full capacity ( previous-block-size = 2 \\* target-block-size), the max change in base fees with each block will only be 12.5%. This improves user experience as the transaction fees can be reliably predicted, and a user can provide the right amount of gas for a given transaction. Pre EIP-1559, the gas fees would have rocketed suddenly, and user transactions with insufficient gas fees would have been stuck for a few hours/days.\n\nDespite adding the base fee and tip parameters, the new transactions are still backward compatible and will work with the legacy transaction functions.\n\n## Will ETH become deflationary?\n\nThe fact of the matter is that no one can predict whether ETH supply will deflate, but we can take estimates. We get a deflationary asset when burning outgrows the minting of the asset. Let’s dive into both these mechanisms:\n\n**Minting**\n\nWe are currently minting [13,600 ETH daily](https://etherscan.io/chart/blockreward) from block rewards to miners. These figures are unlikely to change after EIP-1599.\n\n**Burning**\n\nAs the base fee is burned, the amount of ETH burned is highly dependent on the network congestion or rather block utilization of ETH.\n\nSo the questions remain — *How much can we truly burn*? \\*Would it be enough to make it deflationary? \\*The two primary variables to calculate the burn are Network transaction fees and Base to total fee ratio.\n\nWhile we can estimate the network tx fees based on historical data, the base fee to total fee ratio is anyone’s guess until EIP-1559 goes live and generates substantial data. As of the time of writing this article, Ethereum network participants are spending [3k ETH daily](https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee) on gas.\n\nIf we assume daily transactions to be around 3k/day and the base fee to be 40% of the total transaction fee then 40% of 3k = 1.2k ETH will be burned daily. While this is indeed a high amount, it is nowhere close to the ETH supply that is minted on block rewards. Hence, it is unlikely that ETH will be deflationary as more ETH can be minted than burned. Further, in the event that the network is extremely burdened for a long period of time, and the base fees are extremely high, users are economically incentivized to wait for the network to cool down.\n\nMoreover, as Ethereum scaling solutions have started to gain traction, we anticipate activity to move towards the scaling solutions while the protocols derive security from Ethereum and maintain regular checkpoints. We witnessed a similar [decline](https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee) in network congestion and transaction fee as Polygon started gaining traction as a sidechain.\n\n## Can ETH 2.0 change the game?\n\nAs we have established the unlikely scenario that ETH will deflate post-EIP-1559 because of PoW (Proof of Work) rewards outpacing the burning of the base fee, the scenario will definitely be different as Ethereum transitions to a PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus with the merge of Beacon chain and Ethereum mainnet that is [scheduled](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/) in 2022.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*ghvoucz6cAv4RRYK)\n\nMonthly Net Issuance — Projections\n\nPoS rewards, unlike PoW, are lesser and hence, have limited inflationary pressure on ETH. As shown by the beacon chain [staking rewards page](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/), ETH 2.0 is estimated to generate \\~1.3k ETH daily. If the total transaction fees remain the same as the current system, then we can expect very low inflation and even deflation on ETH!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Rw-5xR-qlBd9M7aN)\n\nETH 2.0 Staking APR Projections\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe EIP-1559 Upgrade is likely to go live on 4th August 2021 between 13:00 UTC and 17:00 UTC, with block 12,965,000. The base fee mechanism hints at the protocol’s direction in trying to take some of the power away from the miners. The EIP-1559 update is paving the way for future progress regardless of whether it turns out to be bullish or bearish for the price in the short term. Ethereum continues to be the most talked about blockchain among its peers and with the recent London Upgrade and ETH 2.0 also under the works, it is likely to be the undisputed Layer 1 blockchain in the near future.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*i4z97794yjrReXyYGTc3kQ.png)\n\n", "timestamp": 1656896869, "digest": "Bc8hcSZJu9ct3Rsx8pUmI8otdyWyyVvVttVSu5HMFj4", "contributor": "0x2d6cd52FAFC326a2CBd93bCb686615Fec6E37BCB"}

{"id": "P4yXPeIiP147F3iGQFLkk9wA81pdnPrAGEEbIJ-NRAg", "title": "Let’s Talk — Layer 2 Solutions", "body": "## Introduction\n\nIn recent times, the usage of layer-2 solutions has been on the rise. Since the start of April 2021, the number of transactions happening on the [Polygon Network](https://polygon.technology/) (a layer-2 solution) has increased from 200k per day to 6mn on a daily average (shown in the chart below), peaking at 9mn in the middle of June. This also signifies a jump from [\\~5% to \\~85%](https://polygonscan.com/chart/networkutilization) network utilization in nearly 5 months. At the same time, the total number of unique addresses on the Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain has grown from [200k to 86mn](https://polygonscan.com/chart/address) (a 430x increase!), with the daily active addresses going up from [9k to 360k](https://polygonscan.com/chart/active-address). This is just one example of a layer-2 solution that has taken off. With the launch of other off-chain scaling solutions, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, on the Ethereum mainnet, the number of users on layer-2 solutions is only going to increase.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*zY-MsHI0Ybo_bwh4)\n\nWhy have layer-2 solutions started burgeoning? The reasons are twofold:\n\n1.  **Transaction throughput and speed** — the throughput on Ethereum, which has been the principal settlement layer for most of DeFi and NFTs’ transactions, has been roughly constant, ranging between [1.3mn and 1.7mn](https://etherscan.io/chart/tx) transactions per day. As the number of transaction requests increases at layer-1, user experience decreases due to fixed and slow transaction speeds.\n2.  **Transaction costs** — the limited transaction speeds have a cascading effect on costs, resulting in higher [transaction fees](https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice) paid by the user due to the auction-based transaction fees model adopted by layer-1 solutions.\n\nLayer-2 technologies help augment the practicality of the foundational blockchain layer (layer-1). They help tackle the above two issues without much loss of decentralization and security. Thus, the main objective of layer-2 solutions is to improve transaction speed and transaction throughput on the base layer and consequently decrease transaction costs. Furthermore, layer-2 solutions also enable use-cases that require higher transaction speeds, such as blockchain-based gaming, high-frequency trading, etc.\n\n## Working of Layer-2 Solutions\n\nGenerally speaking, transactions are submitted to layer-2 nodes instead of being submitted directly to layer-1. The layer-2 instance then batches them into groups before anchoring them to layer-1, after which they are secured by layer-1 and cannot be altered. The details of how this is done vary significantly between different layer-2 technologies and implementations. The major implementations include the following:\n\n1.  Channels\n2.  Plasma\n3.  Sidechains\n4.  Rollups\n\n## Channels\n\nChannels allow participants to transact *X* number of times off-chain (layer-2) while only submitting two transactions to the network on-chain (layer-1). The first transaction opens the connection for the transaction pipeline, whereas the second transaction closes it, therefore, essentially bundling up all the transactions performed during any session as only two transactions. The advantages of such an approach are 1) load reduction on the layer-1 blockchain, and 2) transaction cost reduction for the user.\n\n## Working of Channels Explained\n\nParticipants must lock a portion of Ethereum’s state, like an ETH deposit, into a multisig contract. A multisig contract is a type of contract that requires the signatures (and thus, agreement) of multiple private keys to execute.\n\nLocking the state in this way is the first transaction and opens up the channel. The participants can then transact quickly and freely off-chain. Consensus inside the channel is achieved when all the channel participants unanimously agree (majority-based consensus is also possible) to the final state of the channel. When the interaction is finished, a final on-chain transaction is submitted, unlocking the state. The main chain checks the validity of the state update by verifying signatures and final balances, thus making it impossible to try to exit from an invalid state.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*hM-V7VT44SxzhH1C)\n\nFurther explanation: since all exchanged transactions are equally valid as far as the blockchain is concerned, state channels need a mechanism to ensure that the latest off-chain state is the one that ultimately gets settled on the main chain. Thus, if a party attempts to unilaterally close a channel, other parties in the channel have a period of time — a “dispute window” — in which they have an opportunity to submit a more recent state, thereby proving that fraud was attempted. Once the fraud is proven, the contract handles the resolution process, which typically involves punishing the guilty party by slashing their deposited funds (though one could also simply update to the valid state and proceed accordingly).\n\n## Types of Channels\n\n1.  **Payment Channels** — Payment Channels are simplified channels that only deal with payments. They allow off-chain transfers between two participants, as long as the net sum of their transfers does not exceed the deposited tokens.\n2.  **State Channels** **— **State Channels are very similar to the concept of payment channels, but instead of only supporting payments, they also support general ‘state updates’. Thus, State Channels form the superset. State channels allow for potentially arbitrary state transitions to happen off-chain, opening up the possibility of performing scalable, low-latency computations off-chain with similar security to on-chain transactions. State channels also help preserve user privacy. Transactions within a channel are only known by the participants in the channel and get instant finality. Users don’t have to wait for each transaction to confirm onto the blockchain because each signed transaction abides by the network rules.\n\n## Evaluation\n\n**Advantages**\n\n*   (Almost) instant withdrawal/settling on mainnet\n*   Extremely high throughput is possible\n*   Lowest cost per transaction — good for streaming micropayments\n*   Transitive channels can be created (if A->B and B->C exist, A->C is possible) using Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs), a technique that can allow payments to be securely routed across multiple payment channels\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n*   Time and cost to set up and settle a channel\n*   Exit Problem — long exit times if a valid exit state is not reached by members\n*   Need to periodically watch the network (liveness requirement) or delegate this responsibility to someone else (watchtowers) to ensure the security of your funds\n*   Lockup of funds in open payment channels\n*   Closed participation and censorship\n*   Cannot be used to scale general-purpose smart contracts\n*   Difficult to set up N-to-N channels (due to Exit Problem)\n*   Only safe to use when the layer-1 isn’t censored by the block producers\n*   Need for 100% availability of all the participants involved\n\n**Projects using State Channels**\n\nConnext Network, Raiden Network\n\n## Plasma\n\nPlasma is a construction that enables “non-custodial” child chains (nested blockchains), which borrow the security from the main chain (definition of a child chain). Plasma uses a combination of smart contracts and cryptographic verification (fraud proofs) to achieve higher throughput and low transaction costs in a trustless and secure manner, by offloading these transactions from the main Ethereum blockchain. These Plasma chains (or child chains) periodically report back to the main chain and use it to settle any disputes.\n\nThe design goals of Plasma include:\n\n1.  **World Computation **— data is committed to the root chain (Ethereum) and in the events of Byzantine behavior disputes, frauds are proven and rolled back.\n2.  **Trust Minimization** — the primary risk involved in Plasma is around chain halting and blockspace availability, which are mitigated by selecting a good parent chain.\n3.  **Payment and Ledger Scalability** — more throughput and faster computation time are achieved due to the nested architecture.\n\n**Why Plasma Chains?**\n\nBuilding a two-way peg has been the biggest challenge in designing sidechains (or Plasma chains) with minimal trust assumptions. Creating a peg from parent chain to sidechain is easy to implement: simply lock funds into a contract on the parent chain. The backward peg, which is a sidechain to the parent chain, however, is more difficult to implement as the sidechain is “easier” to attack/manipulate than the parent chain. Various methods have been proposed to resolve this:\n\n1.  **One-way Peg** — This prevents anyone on the sidechain from being malicious and stealing funds on the parent chain. This design is currently being suggested for the beacon chain in Ethereum 2.0, whereby ETH is burned on the parent chain (the PoW Ethereum chain) and simultaneously minted on the sidechain (the PoS beacon chain) as BETH, with no way of doing the reverse.\n2.  **Federated Pegs** — This design uses multiple operators to control the reverse peg (centralized, custodial). The operators decide when funds can be unlocked on the parent chain.\n3.  **Plasma** — Plasma allows for an almost trustless two-way peg. It accomplishes this through the use of an exit game, which makes use of fraud proofs implicitly or explicitly, relying on variations of challenges that must be issued within a given timeout. The caveat here is the trust assumption that the parent chain has an honest majority of block producers. This is why Plasma isn’t completely trustless or completely non-custodial.\n\n## Working of Plasma Explained\n\n1.  Plasma chains are initialized by submitting smart contracts to the parent chain. These chains have special rules defined based on the application that they are being used for (can be thought of as dApps on Ethereum).\n2.  Once smart contracts are deployed, computation takes place in a localized environment.\n3.  Post a batch of computation processes, periodic commits (Plasma chain block hashes) are submitted to the parent chain.\n4.  If any of the data/blocks submitted to the parent chain is invalid according to the consensus rules, fraud proofs of state transitions are submitted by the validators to roll back the state of the main chain.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*BlpHf0e1XeahEFYq)\n\nIn Plasma, the child chain can’t steal users’ funds or prevent users from claiming their funds back on the main chain, given that no consensus rules have been broken.\n\n**Periodic Commits**\n\nPeriodic Commits work in the following manner:\n\n1.  The Plasma chain makes periodic commits to the main chain.\n2.  Only the block hashes/headers are committed to the main chain (low size). The submission is a commitment to the blockstate as well as ordering on the main chain.\n3.  The root chain doesn’t perform computation unless any disputes are raised. However, data availability is needed to prove fraud (which is also a problem in non-global computation).\n4.  A Plasma chain needs to only watch all its parent chains and no other chain, therefore, streamlining the process of blockchain scalability.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*g2Tm-RAYjyK9iZ3Q)\n\n**Fraud Proofs**\n\nThe communication between the child chains and the root chain is secured by fraud proofs implemented by the child chain. Fraud proofs are used by Plasma chains to file a complaint to its parent chain.\n\nThese proofs use an interactive funds-withdrawal protocol. In order to withdraw a certain amount of funds, an exit time is needed. The exiting party must confirm the outputs via the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model requesting a withdrawal. Network participants can then submit a bonded proof that has to be confirmed and tested if any funds have been spent. If the event appears to be wrong, it is treated as fraudulent, and the confirmation is canceled. With time, another bonded round allows the withdrawal to happen, bonding to state before a committed timestamp. In case of attack, participants can quickly exit and save their costs, ensuring security within the system.\n\n## Types of Plasma Chains\n\n1.  **Minimum Viable Plasma (MVP) **— MVP is a design for an extremely simple UTXO-based Plasma chain. MVP enables high-throughput payment transactions but does not support more complicated constructions like scripts or smart contracts. In MVP, users need to sign a signature before making a transaction, wait to see the transaction included in a valid block, and then sign another signature. These second signatures must also be included within a plasma block, reducing block space available for more transactions.\n2.  **More Viable Plasma** — It is an extension of MVP that removes the need for confirmation signatures by changing the procedure for fund withdrawals. The ordering of each withdrawal becomes based on the position of the youngest input to the transaction that created an output, rather than in the order based on the position of the output being withdrawn (which is the case with MVP). **OMG Network** is using More VP (1K TPS, 3x cheaper, 99% energy efficient, ETH secure + watchers).\n3.  **Plasma Cash** — Plasma Cash is a Plasma design primarily built for storing and transferring non-fungible tokens. It is highly scalable because users only ever need to keep track of their own tokens, but at the same time coin proofs are massive. Each block has a ‘slot’ for each coin (unique deposit). When a coin is spent, a transaction proof is recorded in that coin’s respective slot in the block. Coin defragmentation research to support FTs is going on currently. Research is being done in the domain of ‘coin defragmentation’ to support fungible tokens. **Loom Network **(2017)** **is utilizing principles of Plasma Cash for its scaling solution (CryptoZombies, Axie Infinity).\n4.  **Plasma Debit **— It is similar to Plasma Cash, except every token is a payment channel between the user and the chain operator. The channels can be transferred just like a Plasma Cash token.\n5.  **Plasma Prime **— Plasma Prime is a new design that makes use of [RSA accumulators](https://alinush.github.io/2020/11/24/RSA-accumulators.html) to solve the problem of large history proofs in Plasma Cash.\n\n## Evaluation\n\n**Advantages**\n\n*   High throughput, low cost per transaction because of elimination of unnecessary data in the main chain (increase in computation power)\n*   Security of tokens is ensured even in case the Plasma operator proposes invalid state transitions, withholds produced blocks, or stops block production\n*   Allows (almost) trustless transactions unlike channels\n*   Compatible with various on-chain scaling solutions such as sharding, varying block sizes, etc.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n*   Long waiting period for users who want to withdraw their funds\n*   The complexity of exit game strategies\n*   Cannot be used to scale general-purpose smart contracts as it does not support general computation; only basic token transfers, swaps, and a few other transaction types are supported\n*   Need to periodically watch the network (liveness requirement) or delegate this responsibility to someone else (watchtowers) to ensure the security of your funds\n*   Relies on one or more operators (centralized) to store data and serve it upon request in case of disputes\n*   The necessity to provide the full history of the token when it is transferred\n\n**Projects using Plasma**\n\nLoom Network, OMG Network\n\n## Sidechains\n\nSidechains are “sister chains”, where assets can move between each chain (main and side) but the sidechain has its own consensus mechanism (and thus, a set of validators) which distinguishes how the sidechain achieves decentralization. Sidechains sacrifice some level of decentralization to provide higher throughputs and lower costs at varying levels of security (a well-designed sidechain is even more secure than the main chain!). The image below illustrates sidechains and rollups:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*QuhwPre7ON_AdfVF)\n\n## Working of Sidechains Explained\n\nOther than functioning exactly like any blockchain, the sidechains optionally snapshot the block headers to the main chain to prevent forks. The snapshots can provide security against forks even when the validators of the sidechain collude and try to fork out.\n\nIf a participant wants to move assets from the main chain to the sidechain, he/she locks the assets on the main chain and provides proof of the lock on the sidechain. To unlock the assets on the main chain, proof of the exit is included in the sidechain block and provided to the main chain.\n\n## Evaluation\n\n**Advantages**\n\n*   Established technology, since sidechains are nothing but independent blockchains connected via a two-way bridge\n*   Support general computation, EVM compatibility\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n*   Less decentralized, as sidechains have their own validator set\n*   More prone to fraud, as achieving quorum is easier due to a smaller validator set\n*   Uses a separate consensus mechanism, which may not be as secure as the main chain’s algorithm\n*   Invalid state transition problem (assumption taken: 50%+ are honest validators)\n*   Bridges that connect the parent to the sidechain are often centralized and act as single points of failure\n\n**Projects using Sidechains**\n\nxDAI, SKALE, Polygon Network (previously Matic)\n\n## Rollups\n\nRollups are a layer-2 solution that perform computation and execution outside the parent chain, bundle together the transactions into batches, and post the data onto the main chain in a compressed and efficient manner. They provide high transaction throughput, low transaction fees, and transparency because of the verifiable batching mechanism used. According to Vitalik Buterin’s [article](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) on rollups, “an Ethereum base-layer ERC-20 token transfer costs \\~45000 gas, (whereas) an ERC-20 token transfer in a rollup takes up 16 bytes of on-chain space and costs under 300 gas”. This shows that a transfer operation on a rollup takes 150x less fees compared to the fees on the main chain!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*hudZnpmDEl0ZQHNw)\n\n## Working of Rollups Explained\n\nRollups publish just enough data on-chain so that any observer can reconstruct the state and detect invalidity. Because of rollups’ inherited security mechanism, users of rollups can transact with security guarantees that their funds will not be lost, double-spent, or misappropriated till the batched data is added on the main chain at some point in the future. This is a defining characteristic of rollups since the smart contracts associated with rollups inherit the security features of the underlying blockchain.\n\nTherefore, to summarize, the key properties of rollups include the following:\n\n*   transaction execution occurs outside the parent blockchain\n*   data or proof of transactions is posted on the parent at the end of the execution cycle\n*   a roll-up smart contract is deployed on layer-1, which is responsible for enforcing correct transaction execution on layer-2 by using the transaction data on layer-1\n\n## Types of Rollups\n\n1.  **Optimistic Rollups** — Optimistic rollups use fraud proofs to verify and ensure that the data submitted to the main chain is not incorrect. These are the same fraud proofs that are being used in Plasma. “Sequencers” are incentivized to publish a batch of state transitions to the main layer-1. This starts a “dispute period” where any party can publish a fraud-proof which shows that the state transitions are invalid. This fraud-proof is stored in an on-chain transaction, and using the proof, the state of the chain can be determined correctly and used to settle disputes. Entities called “verifiers” are incentivized to watch and report fraudulent transactions. Rollups are an effective solution as they scale without adding to the cost, but they introduce new trust assumptions with respect to the “verifier”. However, only one honest verifier is needed for the system to work properly.\n2.  **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups** — In ZK Rollups, “relayers” gather a set of transactions and create a ZK Proof, a validity proof that is stored on-chain. ZK Rollups rely on challenging transactions to tell the smart contract that some data is incorrect, and the block is invalidated as a result. Here, it is impossible for relayers to submit an invalid or incorrect state. The smart contract verifies each state’s transition before it becomes effective. Validation of a block is quicker and cheaper due to the less data that is included.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*njgrpzgEwHJwIo2w87zbaw.png)\n\nOptimistic Rollups vs Zero-Knowledge Rollups\n\n## Evaluation\n\n**Advantages**\n\n*   Rollups move computation and complete state storage off-chain but keep some data per transaction on-chain\n*   Optimistic Rollups are EVM compatible\n*   High throughput and extremely low fees as computation is done off-chain\n*   More secure as they rely on the main chain’s security\n*   Research is ongoing to bring smart contract capabilities to ZK Rollups, e.g. Starknet’s ZK language ([Cairo](https://medium.com/starkware/hello-cairo-3cb43b13b209))\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n*   Withdrawal times from layer-2 to layer-1 are high in the case of Optimistic Rollups\n*   ZK Rollups are not EVM compatible as validity proofs are computation-intensive\n*   Require additional trust assumptions and economic incentives\n*   Vulnerable to attacks if the value in a rollup exceeds an operator’s bond\n\n**Projects using Rollups**\n\nStarkWare, Optimism Labs, Arbitrum, Loopring\n\n## Comparison\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*GB5QiVNfKMCLc37g)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe world is just starting to adopt distributed ledger technologies, with approximately 1% of the world population interacting with applications built on blockchains and the like. As more and more people recognize and embrace the advantages that Web 3.0 offers, we are going to witness billions of monetary and state transactions on the blockchain every day. To cope up with such a demand, layer-1s would need to deal with the issues related to scalability, such as block size limits, consensus times, and transaction costs. One of the ways this can be achieved is on-chain scaling upgrades such as sharding, but not all chains remain composable post that. The other solution, as mentioned above, is layer-2s and the various customizable flavors that they come in.\n\nDue to the benefits that layer-2 solutions offer with respect to the issues mentioned above, their adoption along with layer-1s is inevitable. As of now, they exist as independent projects aligned with a singular vision of improving the core blockchain that they are being built on.

Educated at Oxford or Paris, Chesney was [Archdeacon of Leicester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Leicester) before his election as bishop in December 1148.\n\nChesney served as a [royal justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_justice) in Lincolnshire during his bishopric, and maintained a close relationship with his nephew, Foliot. He was also an early patron of [Thomas Becket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Becket), and gave the young cleric an office in his diocese early in Becket's career. Although shown favour by [King Stephen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_of_England), including the right to a [mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_(facility)), Chesney was present at the coronation of [King Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England) in 1154 and went on to serve Henry as a royal justice. Around 1160, Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with [St Albans Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans_Abbey) in the diocese of Lincoln, over his right as bishop to supervise the abbey. The dispute was eventually settled when the abbey granted Chesney land in return for his relinquishing any right to oversee St Albans.\n\nChesney was active in his diocese; more than 240 documents relating to his episcopal career survive. They show him mediating disputes between religious houses and granting exemptions and rights in his diocese. Chesney bought a house in London to serve as an episcopal residence, constructed an [episcopal palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Medieval_Bishop%27s_Palace) in Lincoln, and founded a religious house outside the city. He died in December 1166, probably on the 27th, and was buried in [Lincoln Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Cathedral).", "timestamp": 1656827899, "digest": "L_SC9zUdCB1yhdf-MLPqqBvFEdiQf9MbIR71CArK0qM", "contributor": "0xD65464f2c600e0135A232bd0D30e3bE57F5844AF"}

He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*, a complete liturgy for the English Church. With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge, he changed doctrine or discipline in areas such as the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist), [clerical celibacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerical_celibacy), the role of [images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_image) in places of worship, and the [veneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneration) of saints.

He took charge of the university in 1905, after the sudden removal of the president. In this role, he promoted [intramural sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramural_sports), oversaw construction of Ryan Gymnasium, and reformed the curriculum and university governance. He also instituted strict discipline and curtailed [intercollegiate athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_athletics_in_the_United_States), stoking fierce opposition from the student body and their parents, which resulted in his removal by the Jesuit superiors in 1908. Buel then performed pastoral work and taught for several years, before resigning from the Jesuit order in 1912 and secretly marrying in [Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut). When word reached [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.), his former Jesuit colleagues publicly condemned him, and the media claimed his actions resulted in his [excommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication_(Catholic_Church)) *[latae sententiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latae_sententiae)*.\n\nBuel resumed teaching in a secular capacity in New England, but after his marriage, he lived at times in poverty despite his wife's considerable inheritance. He formally left the Catholic Church in 1922 to be ordained an Episcopal priest, but never took up rectorship of a church. He spent his last years in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City).", "timestamp": 1656827098, "digest": "MyQxtrTe4N0VkhmgkfZSA9tqdSyNKWrMpX8ugXPuFNA", "contributor": "0x63F68acaA76fbd579BFb5a52c65a0c4b4e536A88"}

Bucer was originally a member of the [Dominican Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order), but after meeting and being influenced by [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) in 1518 he arranged for his [monastic vows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_vows) to be annulled. He then began to work for the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation), with the support of [Franz von Sickingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Sickingen).\n\nBucer's efforts to reform the church in [Wissembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wissembourg) resulted in his [excommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication) from the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church), and he was forced to flee to Strasbourg. There he joined a team of reformers which included [Matthew Zell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Zell), [Wolfgang Capito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Capito), and [Caspar Hedio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Hedio). He acted as a mediator between the two leading reformers, Martin Luther and [Huldrych Zwingli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldrych_Zwingli), who differed on the doctrine of the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist). Later, Bucer sought agreement on common articles of faith such as the [Tetrapolitan Confession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapolitan_Confession) and the [Wittenberg Concord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittenberg_Concord), working closely with [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) on the latter.\n\nBucer believed that the [Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholics) in the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire) could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by [Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the [Schmalkaldic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmalkaldic_War) and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the [Augsburg Interim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg_Interim), which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.\n\nIn 1549, Bucer was exiled to England, where, under the guidance of [Thomas Cranmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer), he was able to influence the second revision of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*. He died in [Cambridge, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_England), at the age of 59. Although his ministry did not lead to the formation of a new denomination, many Protestant denominations have claimed him as one of their own. He is remembered as an early pioneer of [ecumenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenism).", "timestamp": 1656826696, "digest": "1qT5odKQctR-ftzjO3gQ17vC-cwX6mLxHrI8Hi5zET4", "contributor": "0x0cfF56FD246E455A8B19359241C4329B08893b33"}

Davidson strongly protested his innocence and to raise funds for his reinstatement campaign he exhibited himself in a barrel on the [Blackpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool) seafront. He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature, and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside spectacular.\n\nBefore his ordination in 1903, Davidson had a brief career on the London stage as an entertainer. As a young [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate) he became actively involved with charitable activity among London's poor, an interest he maintained following his appointment in 1906 as [rector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)) of the rural [Norfolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk) parish of [Stiffkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffkey). After the First World War, in which he served as a naval chaplain, he devoted himself primarily to his London work. Styling himself the \"Prostitutes' Padre\",[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Davidson#cite_note-1) his declared mission was the rescue of young girls he considered in danger of falling into vice. In this role he approached and befriended hundreds of girls and, although there was little direct evidence of improper behaviour, Davidson was frequently found in compromising situations. His neglect of his local duties over many years strained relations with his parishioners in Stiffkey; after a formal complaint, the [Bishop of Norwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Norwich) instituted disciplinary proceedings through a [consistory court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistory_court). Davidson's defence was severely compromised by his eccentric conduct, and was damaged beyond repair when the prosecution produced a photograph of him with a near-naked teenage girl.\n\nDavidson's later career as a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His attempts at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles that he had not been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.", "timestamp": 1656828826, "digest": "VfdSzOoh_tJ44i2gxqWieujH_SZToTjHw4HmTR_IXAk", "contributor": "0x67237Ebe4DB2408d808b2D7141D45b3f5eAee216"}

He began his royal service in the government of [Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England), serving as a vice-[chancellor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor). He also accumulated a number of ecclesiastical offices, becoming successively [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(priest)) of [Rouen Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen_Cathedral), treasurer of Rouen, and [archdeacon of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Oxford). King Henry sent him on a number of diplomatic missions and finally rewarded him with the bishopric of Lincoln in 1183. He did not remain there long, for he was [translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(ecclesiastical)) to Rouen in late 1184.\n\nWhen [Richard I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England), King Henry's son, became king in 1189, Coutances absolved Richard for his rebellion against his father and invested him as Duke of Normandy. He then accompanied Richard to Sicily as the king began the [Third Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Crusade), but events in England prompted Richard to send the archbishop back to England to mediate between [William Longchamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Longchamp), the [justiciar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justiciar) whom Richard had left in charge of the kingdom, and Prince [John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_England), Richard's younger brother. Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar's expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title. He remained in the office until late 1193, when he was summoned to Germany by the king, who was being held in captivity there. Coutances became a hostage for the final payment of Richard's ransom on the king's release in February 1194.\n\nCoutances took no further part in English government after returning from Germany. Instead he became involved in Norman affairs, including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of [Andely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Andelys) manor, an archiepiscopal property that Richard desired as a fortress. Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe. Richard went on to build the [castle of Gaillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_Gaillard) on the former archiepiscopal manor. After Richard's death, Coutances invested Prince John as Duke of Normandy, but was forced to pay 2,100 [Angevin pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angevin_pound) to secure contested rights from the new king. After John lost control of Normandy in 1204, the archbishop did not resist the new government of King [Philip II of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_France).

Bucer was originally a member of the [Dominican Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order), but after meeting and being influenced by [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) in 1518 he arranged for his [monastic vows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_vows) to be annulled. He then began to work for the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation), with the support of [Franz von Sickingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Sickingen).\n\nBucer's efforts to reform the church in [Wissembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wissembourg) resulted in his [excommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication) from the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church), and he was forced to flee to Strasbourg. There he joined a team of reformers which included [Matthew Zell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Zell), [Wolfgang Capito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Capito), and [Caspar Hedio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Hedio). He acted as a mediator between the two leading reformers, Martin Luther and [Huldrych Zwingli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldrych_Zwingli), who differed on the doctrine of the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist). Later, Bucer sought agreement on common articles of faith such as the [Tetrapolitan Confession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapolitan_Confession) and the [Wittenberg Concord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittenberg_Concord), working closely with [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) on the latter.\n\nBucer believed that the [Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholics) in the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire) could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by [Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the [Schmalkaldic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmalkaldic_War) and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the [Augsburg Interim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg_Interim), which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.\n\nIn 1549, Bucer was exiled to England, where, under the guidance of [Thomas Cranmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer), he was able to influence the second revision of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*. He died in [Cambridge, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_England), at the age of 59. Although his ministry did not lead to the formation of a new denomination, many Protestant denominations have claimed him as one of their own. He is remembered as an early pioneer of [ecumenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenism).", "timestamp": 1656826696, "digest": "1qT5odKQctR-ftzjO3gQ17vC-cwX6mLxHrI8Hi5zET4", "contributor": "0x0cfF56FD246E455A8B19359241C4329B08893b33"}

Davidson strongly protested his innocence and to raise funds for his reinstatement campaign he exhibited himself in a barrel on the [Blackpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool) seafront. He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature, and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside spectacular.\n\nBefore his ordination in 1903, Davidson had a brief career on the London stage as an entertainer. As a young [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate) he became actively involved with charitable activity among London's poor, an interest he maintained following his appointment in 1906 as [rector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)) of the rural [Norfolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk) parish of [Stiffkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffkey). After the First World War, in which he served as a naval chaplain, he devoted himself primarily to his London work. Styling himself the \"Prostitutes' Padre\",[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Davidson#cite_note-1) his declared mission was the rescue of young girls he considered in danger of falling into vice. In this role he approached and befriended hundreds of girls and, although there was little direct evidence of improper behaviour, Davidson was frequently found in compromising situations. His neglect of his local duties over many years strained relations with his parishioners in Stiffkey; after a formal complaint, the [Bishop of Norwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Norwich) instituted disciplinary proceedings through a [consistory court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistory_court). Davidson's defence was severely compromised by his eccentric conduct, and was damaged beyond repair when the prosecution produced a photograph of him with a near-naked teenage girl.\n\nDavidson's later career as a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His attempts at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles that he had not been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.", "timestamp": 1656828826, "digest": "VfdSzOoh_tJ44i2gxqWieujH_SZToTjHw4HmTR_IXAk", "contributor": "0x67237Ebe4DB2408d808b2D7141D45b3f5eAee216"}

Branham was the first American [deliverance minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance_ministry) to successfully campaign in Europe; his ministry reached global audiences with major campaigns held in North America, Europe, Africa, and India.\n\nBranham claimed that he had received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry and launching his campaigning career in mid-1946. His fame rapidly spread as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings. His ministry spawned many emulators and set the broader healing revival that later became the modern [charismatic movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_movement) in motion. At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and \"the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation\".[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarrell197839-8) From 1955, Branham's campaigning and popularity began to decline as the [Pentecostal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostalism) churches began to withdraw their support from the healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons. By 1960, Branham transitioned into a teaching ministry.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who followed doctrinal teachings which are known as the [Full Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Gospel) tradition, Branham developed an alternative [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology) which was primarily a mixture of [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinist) and [Arminian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminian) doctrines, and had a heavy focus on [dispensationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism) and Branham's own unique [eschatological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology) views. While widely accepting the [restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorationism) doctrine he espoused during the healing revival, his divergent post-revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his charismatic and Pentecostal contemporaries, who subsequently disavowed many of the doctrines as \"revelatory madness\".[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoriarty199255-9) His racial teachings on [serpent seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_seed) and his belief that membership in a [Christian denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination) was connected to the [mark of the beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_beast) alienated many of his former supporters. His closest followers, however, accepted his sermons as oral [scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text) and refer to his teachings as The Message. Despite Branham's objections, some followers of his teachings placed him at the center of a [cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) during his final years. Branham claimed that he had converted over one million people during his career. His teachings continue to be promoted by the William Branham Evangelistic Association, which reported that about 2 million people received its material in 2018. Branham died following a car accident in 1965.\n\nThroughout his healing revivals, Branham was accused of committing [fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud) by investigative news reporters, fellow ministers, host churches, and governmental agencies. Numerous people pronounced healed died shortly thereafter, investigators discovered evidence suggesting miracles may have been staged, and Branham was found to have significantly embellished and falsified numerous stories he presented to his audiences as fact. Branham faced legal problems as a result of his practices. The governments of South Africa and Norway intervened in order to stop his healing campaigns in their countries. In the United States, Branham was charged with [tax evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion) for failing to account for the donations received through his ministry; admitting his liability, he settled the case out of court. The news media has linked Branham to multiple notorious figures. Branham was baptized and ordained a minister by [Roy Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Elonzo_Davis), the National [Imperial Wizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Wizard) (leader) of the [Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Ku_Klux_Klan); the two men maintained a lifelong relationship.

Branham was the first American [deliverance minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance_ministry) to successfully campaign in Europe; his ministry reached global audiences with major campaigns held in North America, Europe, Africa, and India.\n\nBranham claimed that he had received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry and launching his campaigning career in mid-1946. His fame rapidly spread as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings. His ministry spawned many emulators and set the broader healing revival that later became the modern [charismatic movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_movement) in motion. At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and \"the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation\".[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarrell197839-8) From 1955, Branham's campaigning and popularity began to decline as the [Pentecostal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostalism) churches began to withdraw their support from the healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons. By 1960, Branham transitioned into a teaching ministry.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who followed doctrinal teachings which are known as the [Full Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Gospel) tradition, Branham developed an alternative [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology) which was primarily a mixture of [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinist) and [Arminian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminian) doctrines, and had a heavy focus on [dispensationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism) and Branham's own unique [eschatological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology) views. While widely accepting the [restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorationism) doctrine he espoused during the healing revival, his divergent post-revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his charismatic and Pentecostal contemporaries, who subsequently disavowed many of the doctrines as \"revelatory madness\".[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoriarty199255-9) His racial teachings on [serpent seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_seed) and his belief that membership in a [Christian denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination) was connected to the [mark of the beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_beast) alienated many of his former supporters. His closest followers, however, accepted his sermons as oral [scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text) and refer to his teachings as The Message. Despite Branham's objections, some followers of his teachings placed him at the center of a [cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) during his final years. Branham claimed that he had converted over one million people during his career. His teachings continue to be promoted by the William Branham Evangelistic Association, which reported that about 2 million people received its material in 2018. Branham died following a car accident in 1965.\n\nThroughout his healing revivals, Branham was accused of committing [fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud) by investigative news reporters, fellow ministers, host churches, and governmental agencies. Numerous people pronounced healed died shortly thereafter, investigators discovered evidence suggesting miracles may have been staged, and Branham was found to have significantly embellished and falsified numerous stories he presented to his audiences as fact. Branham faced legal problems as a result of his practices. The governments of South Africa and Norway intervened in order to stop his healing campaigns in their countries. In the United States, Branham was charged with [tax evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion) for failing to account for the donations received through his ministry; admitting his liability, he settled the case out of court. The news media has linked Branham to multiple notorious figures. Branham was baptized and ordained a minister by [Roy Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Elonzo_Davis), the National [Imperial Wizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Wizard) (leader) of the [Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Ku_Klux_Klan); the two men maintained a lifelong relationship. Branham helped launch and popularize the ministry of [Jim Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones). [Paul Schäfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sch%C3%A4fer), [Robert Martin Gumbura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Martin_Gumbura), [Leo Mercer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Mercer), and other followers of William Branham's teachings have regularly been in the news due to the serious crimes which they committed.

A [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church) priest and [Jesuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus) for much of his life, he later left the Jesuit order to marry, and subsequently left the Catholic Church to become an [Episcopal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_(United_States)) priest. Born at [Watervliet, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watervliet,_New_York), he was the son of [David Hillhouse Buel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hillhouse_Buel_(soldier)), a distinguished [Union Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army) officer, and descended from numerous prominent [New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England) families. While studying at [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University), he formed an acquaintance with priest [Michael J. McGivney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._McGivney), resulting in his conversion to Catholicism and joining the [Society of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus) after graduation.\n\nIn 1901, Buel became a professor at Georgetown University. He took charge of the university in 1905, after the sudden removal of the president. In this role, he promoted [intramural sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramural_sports), oversaw construction of Ryan Gymnasium, and reformed the curriculum and university governance. He also instituted strict discipline and curtailed [intercollegiate athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_athletics_in_the_United_States), stoking fierce opposition from the student body and their parents, which resulted in his removal by the Jesuit superiors in 1908. Buel then performed pastoral work and taught for several years, before resigning from the Jesuit order in 1912 and secretly marrying in [Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut). When word reached [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.), his former Jesuit colleagues publicly condemned him, and the media claimed his actions resulted in his [excommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication_(Catholic_Church)) *[latae sententiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latae_sententiae)*.\n\nBuel resumed teaching in a secular capacity in New England, but after his marriage, he lived at times in poverty despite his wife's considerable inheritance. He formally left the Catholic Church in 1922 to be ordained an Episcopal priest, but never took up rectorship of a church. He spent his last years in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City).", "timestamp": 1656827098, "digest": "MyQxtrTe4N0VkhmgkfZSA9tqdSyNKWrMpX8ugXPuFNA", "contributor": "0x63F68acaA76fbd579BFb5a52c65a0c4b4e536A88"}

The son of a clergyman, he studied [canon law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law) and theology at [Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna) and was tutor to [Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes) [Eugene III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Eugene_III)'s nephew before returning to England to serve successive [bishops of Exeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Exeter). After becoming a [Cistercian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercians) [monk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk) he was named abbot of his monastery at [Forde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forde_Abbey) and subsequently elected to the episcopate at [Worcester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_England). Before becoming a bishop, he wrote theological works and sermons, some of which have survived.\n\nAs a bishop, Baldwin came to the attention of King [Henry II of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England), who was so impressed he insisted that Baldwin become archbishop. In that office, Baldwin quarrelled with his cathedral clergy over the founding of a church, which led to the imprisonment of the clergy in their cloister for more than a year. Baldwin spent some time in [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Wales) with [Gerald of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_of_Wales), preaching and raising money for the [Third Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Crusade). After the coronation of King [Richard I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England), the new king sent Baldwin ahead to the [Holy Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land), where he became embroiled in the politics of the [Kingdom of Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Jerusalem). Baldwin died in the Holy Land while participating in the crusade; his long-running dispute with his clergy led one chronicler to characterise Baldwin as more damaging to Christianity than [Saladin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin).", "timestamp": 1656826358, "digest": "RrDxpiKr4kLdAsH8Jl4PJaPWPSJtJqquTtgUr-6VfLw", "contributor": "0x76e13ba561A04088617A3125Eb9FdfE6bB170fc6"}

Digitally native artwork, virtual galleries, marketplaces, and traditional artwork tied to the blockchain are potent movements in the midst of exponential growth. The promotion and monetization of creativity are in the midst of a Renaissance. Making the world a more beautiful place has never been this accessible.\n\n**All types of creatives- digital artists and designers, painters, and even musicians-  should take this technological change seriously.**\n\nArt represented on the blockchain and displayed in virtual galleries and digital marketplaces magnifies exposure and accessibility to collectors. The movement has spawned unprecedentedly powerful tools for the advancement of creativity.\n\nDamien Hirst, the renowned British artist, [stated on CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/nfts-may-outlast-physical-art-galleries-says-famed-british-artist-damien-hirst.html) that NFTs could outlive physical galleries and ultimately replace them. We think the value propositions are clear- artwork bolstered with blockchain technology is here to stay.\n\n## Starting in Web 3.0 Can Be Daunting\n\nThere is so much noise in the NFT space, and beginning your journey in Web 3.0 can be overwhelming. Crypto wallets, acquiring crypto, gas fees, various blockchains, and preparing art to be represented as NFTs. Some of you may be asking yourself, “What is all of this?” It can be hard to know where to start.\n\nThis is where The Foundation for Art & Blockchain comes in. As a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit, our purpose is to empower creators to manifest authentic art through decentralized technology. At the moment, we believe one of the most impactful ways to do this is by providing resources and guidance to creators interested in this new medium but that may require some assistance to get started. We have many years of experience in the crypto industry and we are excited to share what we have learned through the lens of our vision- to increase the creative capacity of the world.\n\nOn that note, we are proud to announce our latest initiative: **The Mint Fund**\n\n## Mint Fund Details\n\nWe have allocated $3-5000 per cohort. Cohorts are selected every 4-6 weeks.\n\nThe goals of the initiative are:\n\n1. Lower the barriers of entry into the creator economy\n2. Educate and empower artists with tools and resources\n3. Evolve the NFT medium by helping innovative ideas come to life\n\nThe program is available to all creators, regardless of Web3 experience. We have empowered artists in the NFT space since 2018 when FAB was initially funded by a then [record-breaking NFT sale at Christie’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcW7c3SkP_M). Through our [Codex Protocol](https://codexprotocol.com/), we have the tools available for non-digital creators to take advantage of the benefits of blockchain technology.

Davidson strongly protested his innocence and to raise funds for his reinstatement campaign he exhibited himself in a barrel on the [Blackpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool) seafront. He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature, and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside spectacular.\n\nBefore his ordination in 1903, Davidson had a brief career on the London stage as an entertainer. As a young [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate) he became actively involved with charitable activity among London's poor, an interest he maintained following his appointment in 1906 as [rector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)) of the rural [Norfolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk) parish of [Stiffkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffkey). After the First World War, in which he served as a naval chaplain, he devoted himself primarily to his London work. Styling himself the \"Prostitutes' Padre\",[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Davidson#cite_note-1) his declared mission was the rescue of young girls he considered in danger of falling into vice. In this role he approached and befriended hundreds of girls and, although there was little direct evidence of improper behaviour, Davidson was frequently found in compromising situations. His neglect of his local duties over many years strained relations with his parishioners in Stiffkey; after a formal complaint, the [Bishop of Norwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Norwich) instituted disciplinary proceedings through a [consistory court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistory_court). Davidson's defence was severely compromised by his eccentric conduct, and was damaged beyond repair when the prosecution produced a photograph of him with a near-naked teenage girl.\n\nDavidson's later career as a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His attempts at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles that he had not been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.", "timestamp": 1656828826, "digest": "VfdSzOoh_tJ44i2gxqWieujH_SZToTjHw4HmTR_IXAk", "contributor": "0x67237Ebe4DB2408d808b2D7141D45b3f5eAee216"}

In 1233, he was selected to lead the ailing [diocese of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Dunblane) in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), and faced a struggle to bring the [bishopric of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane) (or \"bishopric of [Strathearn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathearn)\") to financial viability. This involved many negotiations with the powerful religious institutions and secular authorities which had acquired control of the revenue that would normally have been the entitlement of Clement's bishopric. The negotiations proved difficult, forcing Clement to visit the [papal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope) [court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_curia) in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome). While not achieving all of his aims, Clement succeeded in saving the bishopric from relocation to [Inchaffray Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchaffray_Abbey). He also regained enough revenue to begin work on the new [Dunblane Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_Cathedral).\n\nHe faced a similar challenge with the impoverished [bishopric of Argyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Argyll) in the 1240s.

Clement was with the king during his campaign in [Argyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll) in 1249 and was at his side when he died during this campaign.

By 1250 he had established a reputation as one of the most active Dominican reformers in [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Great_Britain). Clement helped to elevate [Edmund of Abingdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Rich) and [Queen Margaret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Margaret_of_Scotland) to sainthood.

He also instituted strict discipline and curtailed [intercollegiate athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_athletics_in_the_United_States), stoking fierce opposition from the student body and their parents, which resulted in his removal by the Jesuit superiors in 1908.

In first-class matches, he played for Middlesex and Cambridge University. A fast bowler and hard-hitting lower-order batsman, Allen later became an influential cricket administrator who held key positions in the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which effectively ruled English cricket at the time; he also served as chairman of the England selectors.\n\nAllen was born in Australia and grew up in England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he established a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he was on the verge of the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932–33, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.\n\nFrom 1933, Allen worked in the London Stock Exchange, which limited the amount of cricket he could play. Even so, he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936–37 tour of Australia, when the home team won 3–2 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play irregularly for Middlesex until 1939; after the Second World War, in which he worked in military intelligence, he played occasionally for Middlesex and other teams into the 1950s. He captained England in a final Test series in the West Indies in 1947–48. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was able to build up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he often scored runs when his team were under pressure.\n\nAs Allen's first-class career came to a close, he moved into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He was instrumental in the creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate illegal bowling actions. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the D'Oliveira affair, a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to Lord's, where he died, aged 87, in 1989.", "timestamp": 1656830029, "digest": "1I91Pf3tofN5bCFa0l_YnREkqc2dOvzHBhJd39NQ0VQ", "contributor": "0x08A6c9787C263337EeF7C241Eb6059B630430370"}

As a young [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate) he became actively involved with charitable activity among London's poor, an interest he maintained following his appointment in 1906 as [rector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)) of the rural [Norfolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk) parish of [Stiffkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffkey). After the First World War, in which he served as a naval chaplain, he devoted himself primarily to his London work. Styling himself the \"Prostitutes' Padre\",[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Davidson#cite_note-1) his declared mission was the rescue of young girls he considered in danger of falling into vice. In this role he approached and befriended hundreds of girls and, although there was little direct evidence of improper behaviour, Davidson was frequently found in compromising situations. His neglect of his local duties over many years strained relations with his parishioners in Stiffkey; after a formal complaint, the [Bishop of Norwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Norwich) instituted disciplinary proceedings through a [consistory court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistory_court). Davidson's defence was severely compromised by his eccentric conduct, and was damaged beyond repair when the prosecution produced a photograph of him with a near-naked teenage girl.\n\nDavidson's later career as a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His attempts at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles that he had not been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.", "timestamp": 1656828826, "digest": "VfdSzOoh_tJ44i2gxqWieujH_SZToTjHw4HmTR_IXAk", "contributor": "0x67237Ebe4DB2408d808b2D7141D45b3f5eAee216"}

He was the longest-serving holder of the office since the [Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation), and the first to retire from it.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh to a Scottish [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian) family, Davidson was educated at [Harrow School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School), where he became an Anglican, and at [Trinity College, Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Oxford), where he was largely untouched by the arguments and debates between adherents of the [high-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-church) and [low-church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-church) factions of the [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England). He was [ordained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination) in 1874, and, after a brief spell as a [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate), he became [chaplain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain) and secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury, [Archibald Campbell Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Campbell_Tait), in which post he became a confidant of [Queen Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria). He rose through the Church hierarchy, becoming [Dean of Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_of_Windsor) (1883), [Bishop of Rochester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Rochester) (1891) and [Bishop of Winchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Winchester) (1895). In 1903 he succeeded [Frederick Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Temple) as Archbishop of Canterbury, and remained in office until his retirement in November 1928.\n\nDavidson was conciliatory by nature, and spent much time throughout his term of office striving to keep the Church together in the face of deep and sometimes acrimonious divisions between [evangelicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Anglicanism) and [Anglo-Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Catholics). Under his leadership the Church gained some independence from state control, but his efforts to modernise the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)* were frustrated by Parliament.\n\nThough cautious about bringing the Church into domestic party politics, Davidson did not shy away from larger political issues: he played a key role in the passage of the reforming [Parliament Act 1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Act_1911); urged moderation on both sides in the conflict over Irish independence; campaigned against perceived immoral methods of warfare in the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) and led efforts to resolve the national crisis of the [1926 General Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1926_United_Kingdom_general_strike).

Branham was the first American [deliverance minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance_ministry) to successfully campaign in Europe; his ministry reached global audiences with major campaigns held in North America, Europe, Africa, and India.\n\nBranham claimed that he had received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry and launching his campaigning career in mid-1946. His fame rapidly spread as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings. His ministry spawned many emulators and set the broader healing revival that later became the modern [charismatic movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_movement) in motion. At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and \"the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation\".[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarrell197839-8) From 1955, Branham's campaigning and popularity began to decline as the [Pentecostal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostalism) churches began to withdraw their support from the healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons. By 1960, Branham transitioned into a teaching ministry.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who followed doctrinal teachings which are known as the [Full Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Gospel) tradition, Branham developed an alternative [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology) which was primarily a mixture of [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinist) and [Arminian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminian) doctrines, and had a heavy focus on [dispensationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism) and Branham's own unique [eschatological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology) views. While widely accepting the [restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorationism) doctrine he espoused during the healing revival, his divergent post-revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his charismatic and Pentecostal contemporaries, who subsequently disavowed many of the doctrines as \"revelatory madness\".[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoriarty199255-9) His racial teachings on [serpent seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_seed) and his belief that membership in a [Christian denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination) was connected to the [mark of the beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_beast) alienated many of his former supporters. His closest followers, however, accepted his sermons as oral [scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text) and refer to his teachings as The Message. Despite Branham's objections, some followers of his teachings placed him at the center of a [cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) during his final years. Branham claimed that he had converted over one million people during his career. His teachings continue to be promoted by the William Branham Evangelistic Association, which reported that about 2 million people received its material in 2018. Branham died following a car accident in 1965.\n\nThroughout his healing revivals, Branham was accused of committing [fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud) by investigative news reporters, fellow ministers, host churches, and governmental agencies. Numerous people pronounced healed died shortly thereafter, investigators discovered evidence suggesting miracles may have been staged, and Branham was found to have significantly embellished and falsified numerous stories he presented to his audiences as fact. Branham faced legal problems as a result of his practices. The governments of South Africa and Norway intervened in order to stop his healing campaigns in their countries. In the United States, Branham was charged with [tax evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion) for failing to account for the donations received through his ministry; admitting his liability, he settled the case out of court. The news media has linked Branham to multiple notorious figures. Branham was baptized and ordained a minister by [Roy Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Elonzo_Davis), the National [Imperial Wizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Wizard) (leader) of the [Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Ku_Klux_Klan); the two men maintained a lifelong relationship. Branham helped launch and popularize the ministry of [Jim Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones). [Paul Schäfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sch%C3%A4fer), [Robert Martin Gumbura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Martin_Gumbura), [Leo Mercer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Mercer), and other followers of William Branham's teachings have regularly been in the news due to the serious crimes which they committed.

He acted as a mediator between the two leading reformers, Martin Luther and [Huldrych Zwingli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldrych_Zwingli), who differed on the doctrine of the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist). Later, Bucer sought agreement on common articles of faith such as the [Tetrapolitan Confession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapolitan_Confession) and the [Wittenberg Concord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittenberg_Concord), working closely with [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) on the latter.\n\nBucer believed that the [Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholics) in the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire) could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by [Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the [Schmalkaldic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmalkaldic_War) and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the [Augsburg Interim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg_Interim), which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.\n\nIn 1549, Bucer was exiled to England, where, under the guidance of [Thomas Cranmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer), he was able to influence the second revision of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*. He died in [Cambridge, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_England), at the age of 59. Although his ministry did not lead to the formation of a new denomination, many Protestant denominations have claimed him as one of their own. He is remembered as an early pioneer of [ecumenism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenism).", "timestamp": 1656826696, "digest": "1qT5odKQctR-ftzjO3gQ17vC-cwX6mLxHrI8Hi5zET4", "contributor": "0x0cfF56FD246E455A8B19359241C4329B08893b33"}

Born at [Watervliet, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watervliet,_New_York), he was the son of [David Hillhouse Buel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hillhouse_Buel_(soldier)), a distinguished [Union Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army) officer, and descended from numerous prominent [New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England) families. While studying at [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University), he formed an acquaintance with priest [Michael J.

He took charge of the university in 1905, after the sudden removal of the president. In this role, he promoted [intramural sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramural_sports), oversaw construction of Ryan Gymnasium, and reformed the curriculum and university governance. He also instituted strict discipline and curtailed [intercollegiate athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_athletics_in_the_United_States), stoking fierce opposition from the student body and their parents, which resulted in his removal by the Jesuit superiors in 1908. Buel then performed pastoral work and taught for several years, before resigning from the Jesuit order in 1912 and secretly marrying in [Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut). When word reached [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.), his former Jesuit colleagues publicly condemned him, and the media claimed his actions resulted in his [excommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication_(Catholic_Church)) *[latae sententiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latae_sententiae)*.\n\nBuel resumed teaching in a secular capacity in New England, but after his marriage, he lived at times in poverty despite his wife's considerable inheritance.

Davidson strongly protested his innocence and to raise funds for his reinstatement campaign he exhibited himself in a barrel on the [Blackpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool) seafront. He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature, and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside spectacular.\n\nBefore his ordination in 1903, Davidson had a brief career on the London stage as an entertainer. As a young [curate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate) he became actively involved with charitable activity among London's poor, an interest he maintained following his appointment in 1906 as [rector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)) of the rural [Norfolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk) parish of [Stiffkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffkey). After the First World War, in which he served as a naval chaplain, he devoted himself primarily to his London work. Styling himself the \"Prostitutes' Padre\",[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Davidson#cite_note-1) his declared mission was the rescue of young girls he considered in danger of falling into vice. In this role he approached and befriended hundreds of girls and, although there was little direct evidence of improper behaviour, Davidson was frequently found in compromising situations. His neglect of his local duties over many years strained relations with his parishioners in Stiffkey; after a formal complaint, the [Bishop of Norwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Norwich) instituted disciplinary proceedings through a [consistory court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistory_court). Davidson's defence was severely compromised by his eccentric conduct, and was damaged beyond repair when the prosecution produced a photograph of him with a near-naked teenage girl.\n\nDavidson's later career as a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His attempts at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles that he had not been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.", "timestamp": 1656828826, "digest": "VfdSzOoh_tJ44i2gxqWieujH_SZToTjHw4HmTR_IXAk", "contributor": "0x67237Ebe4DB2408d808b2D7141D45b3f5eAee216"}

He began his royal service in the government of [Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England), serving as a vice-[chancellor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor). He also accumulated a number of ecclesiastical offices, becoming successively [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(priest)) of [Rouen Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen_Cathedral), treasurer of Rouen, and [archdeacon of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Oxford). King Henry sent him on a number of diplomatic missions and finally rewarded him with the bishopric of Lincoln in 1183. He did not remain there long, for he was [translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(ecclesiastical)) to Rouen in late 1184.\n\nWhen [Richard I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England), King Henry's son, became king in 1189, Coutances absolved Richard for his rebellion against his father and invested him as Duke of Normandy. He then accompanied Richard to Sicily as the king began the [Third Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Crusade), but events in England prompted Richard to send the archbishop back to England to mediate between [William Longchamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Longchamp), the [justiciar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justiciar) whom Richard had left in charge of the kingdom, and Prince [John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_England), Richard's younger brother. Coutances succeeded in securing a peace between Longchamp and John, but further actions by Longchamp led to the justiciar's expulsion from England, replaced in his role by Coutances, even though he never formally used the title. He remained in the office until late 1193, when he was summoned to Germany by the king, who was being held in captivity there. Coutances became a hostage for the final payment of Richard's ransom on the king's release in February 1194.\n\nCoutances took no further part in English government after returning from Germany. Instead he became involved in Norman affairs, including a dispute with Richard over the ownership of [Andely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Andelys) manor, an archiepiscopal property that Richard desired as a fortress. Eventually the archbishop surrendered it to the king in return for two other manors and the seaport of Dieppe. Richard went on to build the [castle of Gaillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_Gaillard) on the former archiepiscopal manor. After Richard's death, Coutances invested Prince John as Duke of Normandy, but was forced to pay 2,100 [Angevin pounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angevin_pound) to secure contested rights from the new king. After John lost control of Normandy in 1204, the archbishop did not resist the new government of King [Philip II of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_France).

The son of a clergyman, he studied [canon law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law) and theology at [Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna) and was tutor to [Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes) [Eugene III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Eugene_III)'s nephew before returning to England to serve successive [bishops of Exeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Exeter). After becoming a [Cistercian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercians) [monk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk) he was named abbot of his monastery at [Forde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forde_Abbey) and subsequently elected to the episcopate at [Worcester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_England). Before becoming a bishop, he wrote theological works and sermons, some of which have survived.\n\nAs a bishop, Baldwin came to the attention of King [Henry II of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England), who was so impressed he insisted that Baldwin become archbishop. In that office, Baldwin quarrelled with his cathedral clergy over the founding of a church, which led to the imprisonment of the clergy in their cloister for more than a year. Baldwin spent some time in [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Wales) with [Gerald of Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_of_Wales), preaching and raising money for the [Third Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Crusade).

Baldwin died in the Holy Land while participating in the crusade; his long-running dispute with his clergy led one chronicler to characterise Baldwin as more damaging to Christianity than [Saladin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin).", "timestamp": 1656826358, "digest": "RrDxpiKr4kLdAsH8Jl4PJaPWPSJtJqquTtgUr-6VfLw", "contributor": "0x76e13ba561A04088617A3125Eb9FdfE6bB170fc6"}

He was a principal figure in the development of the system of [Christian theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_theology) later called [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism), including its doctrines of [predestination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination) and of God's [absolute sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monergism) in the [salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation) of the human soul from death and [eternal damnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation).

Various [Congregational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregational_church), [Reformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_churches) and [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian) churches, which look to Calvin as the chief expositor of their beliefs, have spread throughout the world.\n\nCalvin was a tireless [polemicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemicist) and [apologetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_apologetics) writer who generated much controversy. He also exchanged cordial and supportive letters with many reformers, including [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) and [Heinrich Bullinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Bullinger). In addition to his seminal *[Institutes of the Christian Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutes_of_the_Christian_Religion)*, Calvin wrote commentaries on most books of the Bible, [confessional documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_of_faith), and various other theological treatises.\n\nCalvin was originally trained as a [humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Humanism) lawyer. He broke from the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church) around 1530. After religious tensions erupted in widespread deadly violence against [Protestant Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Christians) in France, Calvin fled to [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel), Switzerland, where in 1536 he published the first edition of the *Institutes*. In that same year, Calvin was recruited by Frenchman [William Farel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Farel) to join the Reformation in [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva), where he regularly preached sermons throughout the week. However, the governing council of the city resisted the implementation of their ideas, and both men were expelled. At the invitation of [Martin Bucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bucer), Calvin proceeded to [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg), where he became the minister of a church of French refugees. He continued to support the reform movement in Geneva, and in 1541 he was invited back to lead the church of the city.\n\nFollowing his return, Calvin introduced new forms of church government and [liturgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_liturgy), despite opposition from several powerful families in the city who tried to curb his authority. During this period, [Michael Servetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Servetus), a Spaniard regarded by both Roman Catholics and Protestants as having a [heretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_heresy) view of the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), arrived in Geneva. He was denounced by Calvin and [burned at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned_at_the_stake) for heresy by the city council. Following an influx of supportive refugees and new elections to the city council, Calvin's opponents were forced out. Calvin spent his final years promoting the Reformation both in Geneva and throughout Europe.", "timestamp": 1656827748, "digest": "-n8tI6ROe8agkxGBLsUw8UStXZIBJuRCs7LZWjF-BdI", "contributor": "0x3514ba749D7d718a96033d2576d6C106DffFd5cb"}

He helped build the case for the annulment of Henry's marriage to [Catherine of Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon), which was one of the causes of the separation of the English Church from union with the [Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See). Along with [Thomas Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cromwell), he supported the principle of [royal supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Supremacy), in which the king was considered sovereign over the Church within his realm.\n\nDuring Cranmer's tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury, he was responsible for establishing the first doctrinal and liturgical structures of the reformed [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England). Under Henry's rule, Cranmer did not make many radical changes in the Church, due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers. He published the first officially authorised [vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular) service, the *[Exhortation and Litany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhortation_and_Litany)*.\n\nWhen Edward came to the throne, Cranmer was able to promote major reforms. He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*, a complete liturgy for the English Church. With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge, he changed doctrine or discipline in areas such as the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist), [clerical celibacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerical_celibacy), the role of [images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_image) in places of worship, and the [veneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneration) of saints. Cranmer [promulgated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promulgate) the new doctrines through the Prayer Book, the *[Homilies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_Homilies)* and other publications.\n\nAfter the accession of the [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic) Mary I, Cranmer was put on trial for treason and [heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy). Imprisoned for over two years and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several [recantations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recantation) and apparently reconciled himself with the Catholic Church. While this would have normally absolved him, Mary wanted him executed, and, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a [heretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heretic) to Catholics and a [martyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr) for the principles of the English Reformation. Cranmer's death was immortalised in *[Foxe's Book of Martyrs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxe%27s_Book_of_Martyrs)* and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the *Book of Common Prayer* and the *[Thirty-Nine Articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-Nine_Articles)*, an [Anglican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican) statement of faith derived from his work.", "timestamp": 1656828736, "digest": "4GtH243S1icg5XTfUSEnNAG-gUQ8URf_10qH8OxWMQI", "contributor": "0x5EEEf40346A3eb27E32af0668Fac892d6971689F"}

He took charge of the university in 1905, after the sudden removal of the president. In this role, he promoted [intramural sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramural_sports), oversaw construction of Ryan Gymnasium, and reformed the curriculum and university governance.

He was a principal figure in the development of the system of [Christian theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_theology) later called [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism), including its doctrines of [predestination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination) and of God's [absolute sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monergism) in the [salvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation) of the human soul from death and [eternal damnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation).

He also exchanged cordial and supportive letters with many reformers, including [Philipp Melanchthon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Melanchthon) and [Heinrich Bullinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Bullinger). In addition to his seminal *[Institutes of the Christian Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutes_of_the_Christian_Religion)*, Calvin wrote commentaries on most books of the Bible, [confessional documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_of_faith), and various other theological treatises.\n\nCalvin was originally trained as a [humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Humanism) lawyer. He broke from the [Roman Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church) around 1530. After religious tensions erupted in widespread deadly violence against [Protestant Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Christians) in France, Calvin fled to [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel), Switzerland, where in 1536 he published the first edition of the *Institutes*. In that same year, Calvin was recruited by Frenchman [William Farel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Farel) to join the Reformation in [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva), where he regularly preached sermons throughout the week. However, the governing council of the city resisted the implementation of their ideas, and both men were expelled. At the invitation of [Martin Bucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bucer), Calvin proceeded to [Strasbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg), where he became the minister of a church of French refugees. He continued to support the reform movement in Geneva, and in 1541 he was invited back to lead the church of the city.\n\nFollowing his return, Calvin introduced new forms of church government and [liturgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_liturgy), despite opposition from several powerful families in the city who tried to curb his authority. During this period, [Michael Servetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Servetus), a Spaniard regarded by both Roman Catholics and Protestants as having a [heretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_heresy) view of the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity), arrived in Geneva. He was denounced by Calvin and [burned at the stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned_at_the_stake) for heresy by the city council.

In first-class matches, he played for Middlesex and Cambridge University. A fast bowler and hard-hitting lower-order batsman, Allen later became an influential cricket administrator who held key positions in the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which effectively ruled English cricket at the time; he also served as chairman of the England selectors.\n\nAllen was born in Australia and grew up in England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he established a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he was on the verge of the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932–33, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.\n\nFrom 1933, Allen worked in the London Stock Exchange, which limited the amount of cricket he could play. Even so, he was appointed England captain in 1936 and led the team during the 1936–37 tour of Australia, when the home team won 3–2 having lost the first two matches. He continued to play irregularly for Middlesex until 1939; after the Second World War, in which he worked in military intelligence, he played occasionally for Middlesex and other teams into the 1950s. He captained England in a final Test series in the West Indies in 1947–48. As a cricketer, Allen was affected by his lack of regular play and was at his most effective during his two tours of Australia when he was able to build up his form. At other times, his bowling was often erratic but occasionally devastating. An orthodox batsman, he often scored runs when his team were under pressure.\n\nAs Allen's first-class career came to a close, he moved into administration and held considerable influence in English and world cricket. He was instrumental in the creation of a MCC coaching manual, and worked hard to eliminate illegal bowling actions. As chairman of selectors from 1955 to 1961, he presided over a period of great success for English cricket, during which he worked closely with the Test captain Peter May. In 1963, he became MCC president, and was made the club's treasurer the following year. In this role, he was deeply involved in the D'Oliveira affair, a controversy over the potential selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. After Allen's gradual retirement from his administrative roles, he was knighted in 1986 and spent his later years in a flat close to Lord's, where he died, aged 87, in 1989.", "timestamp": 1656830029, "digest": "1I91Pf3tofN5bCFa0l_YnREkqc2dOvzHBhJd39NQ0VQ", "contributor": "0x08A6c9787C263337EeF7C241Eb6059B630430370"}

He first played for the New York Base Ball Club in 1840 and started his Knickerbockers career five years later, continuing to play for the club into his forties and to take part in inter-squad practice games and matches against opposing teams. Researchers have called Adams the creator of the [shortstop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop) position, which he used to field short throws from [outfielders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder). In addition to his playing career, Adams manufactured baseballs and oversaw [bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat) production; he also occasionally acted as an [umpire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)).\n\nFrom 1847 to 1861, the Knickerbockers selected Adams as their president six times, and as a vice president, treasurer, or director in six other years. As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-[inning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning) games. When the [National Association of Base Ball Players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Base_Ball_Players) (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' [bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field#Specifications) should be 90 feet (27 m) apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the \"bound rule\", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as [outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)). He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in *[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)*; by 1993, researcher [John Thorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thorn) had written about Adams' role. Other historians have given him credit for helping to develop the sport, and Thorn has called Adams \"first among the Fathers of Baseball\".[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Adams#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThorn19937-1)\n\nA graduate of [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University) and [Harvard Medical School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School), Adams began working in the medical field in the late 1830s, and practiced in New York City during his time as a member of the Knickerbockers. In 1865, he left medicine and later became a bank president and member of the [Connecticut legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_House_of_Representatives). He and his wife had five children.", "timestamp": 1656829738, "digest": "bWIRuI32L9bMw4kI7Xzq-IX0hBWCNSHBdmSfagJF2FA", "contributor": "0x607683446430F1996BD700b3bD6621Cfc565b5aC"}

Branham", "body": "**William Marrion Branham** (April 6, 1909 – December 24, 1965) was an American Christian minister and [faith healer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_healing) who initiated the post–[World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) [healing revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing_revival), and claimed to be a prophet with the anointing of [Elijah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah), who had come to herald [Christ's second coming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming); some of his followers have been labeled a \"[doomsday cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_cult)\".[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-hwd-1)[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-lgp-2)[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-tcp-3) He is credited as \"a principal architect of [restorationist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorationist) thought\" for charismatics by some Christian historians,[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoriarty1992119-4) and has been called the \"leading individual in the [Second Wave of Pentecostalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-charismatic_movement).\"[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-5) He made a lasting influence on [televangelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Televangelism) and the modern [charismatic movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_movement),[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWeaver2000v-6) and his \"stage presence remains a legend unparalleled in the history of the Charismatic movement\".[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTESims1996195-7) At the time they were held, his inter-denominational meetings were the largest religious meetings ever held in some American cities. Branham was the first American [deliverance minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance_ministry) to successfully campaign in Europe; his ministry reached global audiences with major campaigns held in North America, Europe, Africa, and India.\n\nBranham claimed that he had received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry and launching his campaigning career in mid-1946. His fame rapidly spread as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings. His ministry spawned many emulators and set the broader healing revival that later became the modern [charismatic movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_movement) in motion. At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and \"the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation\".[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarrell197839-8) From 1955, Branham's campaigning and popularity began to decline as the [Pentecostal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostalism) churches began to withdraw their support from the healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons. By 1960, Branham transitioned into a teaching ministry.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who followed doctrinal teachings which are known as the [Full Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Gospel) tradition, Branham developed an alternative [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology) which was primarily a mixture of [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinist) and [Arminian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminian) doctrines, and had a heavy focus on [dispensationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism) and Branham's own unique [eschatological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology) views. While widely accepting the [restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorationism) doctrine he espoused during the healing revival, his divergent post-revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his charismatic and Pentecostal contemporaries, who subsequently disavowed many of the doctrines as \"revelatory madness\".[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Branham#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMoriarty199255-9) His racial teachings on [serpent seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_seed) and his belief that membership in a [Christian denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination) was connected to the [mark of the beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_beast) alienated many of his former supporters. His closest followers, however, accepted his sermons as oral [scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text) and refer to his teachings as The Message. Despite Branham's objections, some followers of his teachings placed him at the center of a [cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) during his final years. Branham claimed that he had converted over one million people during his career. His teachings continue to be promoted by the William Branham Evangelistic Association, which reported that about 2 million people received its material in 2018. Branham died following a car accident in 1965.\n\nThroughout his healing revivals, Branham was accused of committing [fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud) by investigative news reporters, fellow ministers, host churches, and governmental agencies. Numerous people pronounced healed died shortly thereafter, investigators discovered evidence suggesting miracles may have been staged, and Branham was found to have significantly embellished and falsified numerous stories he presented to his audiences as fact. Branham faced legal problems as a result of his practices. The governments of South Africa and Norway intervened in order to stop his healing campaigns in their countries. In the United States, Branham was charged with [tax evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion) for failing to account for the donations received through his ministry; admitting his liability, he settled the case out of court. The news media has linked Branham to multiple notorious figures. Branham was baptized and ordained a minister by [Roy Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Elonzo_Davis), the National [Imperial Wizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Wizard) (leader) of the [Ku Klux Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Ku_Klux_Klan); the two men maintained a lifelong relationship. Branham helped launch and popularize the ministry of [Jim Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones). [Paul Schäfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Sch%C3%A4fer), [Robert Martin Gumbura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Martin_Gumbura), [Leo Mercer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Mercer), and other followers of William Branham's teachings have regularly been in the news due to the serious crimes which they committed.

He helped build the case for the annulment of Henry's marriage to [Catherine of Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon), which was one of the causes of the separation of the English Church from union with the [Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See). Along with [Thomas Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cromwell), he supported the principle of [royal supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Supremacy), in which the king was considered sovereign over the Church within his realm.\n\nDuring Cranmer's tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury, he was responsible for establishing the first doctrinal and liturgical structures of the reformed [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England). Under Henry's rule, Cranmer did not make many radical changes in the Church, due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers. He published the first officially authorised [vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular) service, the *[Exhortation and Litany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhortation_and_Litany)*.\n\nWhen Edward came to the throne, Cranmer was able to promote major reforms. He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*, a complete liturgy for the English Church. With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge, he changed doctrine or discipline in areas such as the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist), [clerical celibacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerical_celibacy), the role of [images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_image) in places of worship, and the [veneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneration) of saints. Cranmer [promulgated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promulgate) the new doctrines through the Prayer Book, the *[Homilies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_Homilies)* and other publications.\n\nAfter the accession of the [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic) Mary I, Cranmer was put on trial for treason and [heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy). Imprisoned for over two years and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several [recantations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recantation) and apparently reconciled himself with the Catholic Church. While this would have normally absolved him, Mary wanted him executed, and, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a [heretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heretic) to Catholics and a [martyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr) for the principles of the English Reformation.

In 1233, he was selected to lead the ailing [diocese of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Dunblane) in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), and faced a struggle to bring the [bishopric of Dunblane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane) (or \"bishopric of [Strathearn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathearn)\") to financial viability. This involved many negotiations with the powerful religious institutions and secular authorities which had acquired control of the revenue that would normally have been the entitlement of Clement's bishopric. The negotiations proved difficult, forcing Clement to visit the [papal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope) [court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_curia) in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome). While not achieving all of his aims, Clement succeeded in saving the bishopric from relocation to [Inchaffray Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchaffray_Abbey). He also regained enough revenue to begin work on the new [Dunblane Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_Cathedral).\n\nHe faced a similar challenge with the impoverished [bishopric of Argyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Argyll) in the 1240s. He was given the job of restoring the viability of the [diocese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese) and installing a new bishop; this involved forming a close relationship with King [Alexander II of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Scotland). Clement was with the king during his campaign in [Argyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll) in 1249 and was at his side when he died during this campaign.

By 1250 he had established a reputation as one of the most active Dominican reformers in [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Great_Britain). Clement helped to elevate [Edmund of Abingdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Rich) and [Queen Margaret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Margaret_of_Scotland) to sainthood.

He helped build the case for the annulment of Henry's marriage to [Catherine of Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon), which was one of the causes of the separation of the English Church from union with the [Holy See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See). Along with [Thomas Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cromwell), he supported the principle of [royal supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Supremacy), in which the king was considered sovereign over the Church within his realm.\n\nDuring Cranmer's tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury, he was responsible for establishing the first doctrinal and liturgical structures of the reformed [Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England). Under Henry's rule, Cranmer did not make many radical changes in the Church, due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers. He published the first officially authorised [vernacular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular) service, the *[Exhortation and Litany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhortation_and_Litany)*.\n\nWhen Edward came to the throne, Cranmer was able to promote major reforms. He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the *[Book of Common Prayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer)*, a complete liturgy for the English Church. With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge, he changed doctrine or discipline in areas such as the [Eucharist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist), [clerical celibacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerical_celibacy), the role of [images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_image) in places of worship, and the [veneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneration) of saints. Cranmer [promulgated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promulgate) the new doctrines through the Prayer Book, the *[Homilies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_Homilies)* and other publications.\n\nAfter the accession of the [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic) Mary I, Cranmer was put on trial for treason and [heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy). Imprisoned for over two years and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several [recantations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recantation) and apparently reconciled himself with the Catholic Church. While this would have normally absolved him, Mary wanted him executed, and, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a [heretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heretic) to Catholics and a [martyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr) for the principles of the English Reformation. Cranmer's death was immortalised in *[Foxe's Book of Martyrs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxe%27s_Book_of_Martyrs)* and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the *Book of Common Prayer* and the *[Thirty-Nine Articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-Nine_Articles)*, an [Anglican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican) statement of faith derived from his work.", "timestamp": 1656828736, "digest": "4GtH243S1icg5XTfUSEnNAG-gUQ8URf_10qH8OxWMQI", "contributor": "0x5EEEf40346A3eb27E32af0668Fac892d6971689F"}

The Cardinals defeated the Yankees four games to three in the [best-of-seven series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format#Best-of-seven_playoff), which took place from October 2 to 10, 1926, at [Yankee Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium_(1923)) and [Sportsman's Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsman%27s_Park).\n\nThis was the first [World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series) appearance (and first National League pennant win) for the Cardinals, and would be the first of 11 World Series championships in Cardinals history. The Yankees were playing in their fourth World Series in six years after winning their first American League pennant in [1921](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1921_World_Series) and their first world championship in [1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1923_World_Series).[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1926_World_Series#cite_note-3) They would play in another 36 World Series (and win 26 of those) through the end of the 2020 season.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1926_World_Series#cite_note-4)\n\nIn Game 1, [Herb Pennock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Pennock) pitched the Yankees to a 2–1 win over the Cards.

After Ruth's three-homer game, the boy's condition miraculously improved. The newspapers' account of the story is disputed by contemporary baseball historians, but it remains one of the most famous anecdotes in baseball history. Pennock again won for the Yankees in Game 5, 3–2.\n\nCards' player-manager [Rogers Hornsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Hornsby) chose Alexander to start Game 6, and used him in relief to close out Game 7. Behind Alexander, the Cardinals won the final two games of the series, and thus the world championship.

After the Pope declined to appoint him [Archbishop of Armagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Armagh), the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [Bishop of Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Philadelphia) in 1819.\n\nConwell took up the post at an advanced age and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [St. Mary's Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Mary%27s_Roman_Catholic_Church_(Philadelphia)) in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [William Hogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hogan_(priest)), a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process and recalled him to Rome.\n\nAlthough he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [coadjutor bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coadjutor_bishop), [Francis Kenrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Kenrick).

We’re presented with an opportunity to reinvent the way we organize in this digital age*.*\n\nIt is critical we seize the occasion. Cyberspace today suffers from a monumental market failure because it has inherited economic rulesets built for the physical world. Yet unlike the old world of flesh and steel, cyberspace is built on information, a substrate which can be freely replicated. This means public goods are far more important to the growth of cyberspace but our markets are ill-equipped to nurture that growth. We are being held back by our inability to reward the creators of these public goods for the clear impact that they have.\n\n**The Optimism Collective** is a new model of **digital democratic governance** optimized to drive rapid and sustained growth of a decentralized ecosystem. The Collective is a band of communities, companies, and citizens united by a mutually beneficial pact to adhere to the axiom of **impact=profit** — the principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual. This axiom serves as a North Star, motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy.\n\nThe Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that **public goods** cannot be **profitable**. The Collective will consistently provide massive [retroactive](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) incentives for public goods which benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. These public goods act as a propellant for the growth of the Collective economy. Growth which yields profit for the Collective and profit which funds more investment in public goods, all together producing a virtuous cycle of impact driven expansion.\n\nWe expect that as the Collective grows, the scope of what falls under the umbrella of Collective public goods will grow along with it. We imagine a future in which the Collective expands beyond the digital realm and into the physical world. The idea that a decentralized ecosystem could reliably provide for basic human needs at scale may seem idealistic today, but it will seem commonplace tomorrow. We start small out of a sense of pragmatism, but we aim big out of an overwhelming sense of Optimism.\n\nTogether, we will create the future of coordinated, collaborative cyberspace.\n\nTogether, we will summon [Ether’s Phoenix](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/x4LGFwa6RJ_opOaCOwr_VGk04Lp3of41H8ynWaFB27E).\n\nStay Optimistic 🔴✨", "timestamp": 1656838985, "digest": "f-o8J4peSET7yKmw2pp4J9jV5fhNoDCLmy2n668-CBw", "contributor": "0x82548e6904D3d95E0f58c0630e5aF70B02f69b8F"}

We’re presented with an opportunity to reinvent the way we organize in this digital age*.*\n\nIt is critical we seize the occasion. Cyberspace today suffers from a monumental market failure because it has inherited economic rulesets built for the physical world. Yet unlike the old world of flesh and steel, cyberspace is built on information, a substrate which can be freely replicated. This means public goods are far more important to the growth of cyberspace but our markets are ill-equipped to nurture that growth. We are being held back by our inability to reward the creators of these public goods for the clear impact that they have.\n\n**The Optimism Collective** is a new model of **digital democratic governance** optimized to drive rapid and sustained growth of a decentralized ecosystem. The Collective is a band of communities, companies, and citizens united by a mutually beneficial pact to adhere to the axiom of **impact=profit** — the principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual. This axiom serves as a North Star, motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy.\n\nThe Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that **public goods** cannot be **profitable**. The Collective will consistently provide massive [retroactive](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) incentives for public goods which benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. These public goods act as a propellant for the growth of the Collective economy. Growth which yields profit for the Collective and profit which funds more investment in public goods, all together producing a virtuous cycle of impact driven expansion.\n\nWe expect that as the Collective grows, the scope of what falls under the umbrella of Collective public goods will grow along with it. We imagine a future in which the Collective expands beyond the digital realm and into the physical world. The idea that a decentralized ecosystem could reliably provide for basic human needs at scale may seem idealistic today, but it will seem commonplace tomorrow. We start small out of a sense of pragmatism, but we aim big out of an overwhelming sense of Optimism.\n\nTogether, we will create the future of coordinated, collaborative cyberspace.\n\nTogether, we will summon [Ether’s Phoenix](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/x4LGFwa6RJ_opOaCOwr_VGk04Lp3of41H8ynWaFB27E).\n\nStay Optimistic 🔴✨", "timestamp": 1656838985, "digest": "f-o8J4peSET7yKmw2pp4J9jV5fhNoDCLmy2n668-CBw", "contributor": "0x82548e6904D3d95E0f58c0630e5aF70B02f69b8F"}

We’re presented with an opportunity to reinvent the way we organize in this digital age*.*\n\nIt is critical we seize the occasion. Cyberspace today suffers from a monumental market failure because it has inherited economic rulesets built for the physical world. Yet unlike the old world of flesh and steel, cyberspace is built on information, a substrate which can be freely replicated. This means public goods are far more important to the growth of cyberspace but our markets are ill-equipped to nurture that growth. We are being held back by our inability to reward the creators of these public goods for the clear impact that they have.\n\n**The Optimism Collective** is a new model of **digital democratic governance** optimized to drive rapid and sustained growth of a decentralized ecosystem. The Collective is a band of communities, companies, and citizens united by a mutually beneficial pact to adhere to the axiom of **impact=profit** — the principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual. This axiom serves as a North Star, motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy.\n\nThe Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that **public goods** cannot be **profitable**. The Collective will consistently provide massive [retroactive](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) incentives for public goods which benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. These public goods act as a propellant for the growth of the Collective economy. Growth which yields profit for the Collective and profit which funds more investment in public goods, all together producing a virtuous cycle of impact driven expansion.\n\nWe expect that as the Collective grows, the scope of what falls under the umbrella of Collective public goods will grow along with it. We imagine a future in which the Collective expands beyond the digital realm and into the physical world. The idea that a decentralized ecosystem could reliably provide for basic human needs at scale may seem idealistic today, but it will seem commonplace tomorrow. We start small out of a sense of pragmatism, but we aim big out of an overwhelming sense of Optimism.\n\nTogether, we will create the future of coordinated, collaborative cyberspace.\n\nTogether, we will summon [Ether’s Phoenix](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/x4LGFwa6RJ_opOaCOwr_VGk04Lp3of41H8ynWaFB27E).\n\nStay Optimistic 🔴✨", "timestamp": 1656838985, "digest": "f-o8J4peSET7yKmw2pp4J9jV5fhNoDCLmy2n668-CBw", "contributor": "0x82548e6904D3d95E0f58c0630e5aF70B02f69b8F"}

{"id": "MZpoY1W9rL4D3F4c4TPChv7SN5mSrfK-ioui3hkYR-o", "title": "Boom or bust? What the future of NFT could look like", "body": "*NFT’s have become a very popular phenomenon across industries and professions, and a wide range of people, from visual artists to musicians, have earned larger sums of money from buying and selling them. But what does the future have in store? Let’s look at a few of the potential scenarios.*\n\nMany years ago, the idea that a GIF or a JPEG file would be considered an art collectible was unthinkable, but today they are known as NFTs, crypto investment assets with a market that surpassed [49 billion dollars in 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-06/nft-market-surpassed-40-billion-in-2021-new-estimate-shows). These unique digital tokens are bought and sold on the internet and many tech investors have seen huge profits.\n\n## Scenario 1: The market slowly stabilizes\n\nWhen innovations pop up, we are quick to dismiss them as pure fantasy. In the 1990s you’d find plenty of people claiming that the internet was unlikely to take off. Similarly, traditional investors were quick to dismiss cryptocurrencies and NFTs when they first made an appearance – but today it’s a booming market. That’s why it has a good chance of becoming an established part of the investment world. To learn more about it, have a look at <https://buynft.com/>. Here, you can explore the latest collections and look at the marketplaces where the trading takes place.\n\n## Scenario 2: NFTs become prime assets in the virtual world\n\nSome venture capitalists not only believe the NFT market will survive but that it will grow bigger and more important. This is because they are counting on our lives becoming more virtual in the years to come. Rather than simply purchasing digital photos, videos, and assets for games, we might soon be [buying real estate and stocks.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/14/stocks-and-property-will-be-turned-into-nfts-vc-says.html) Effectively, this will mean a metaverse in which everything is turned into an NFT token that can be bought with cryptocurrency. How this will coexist with our physical lives in the “real world” is unclear, but the revolution is already on its way.\n\n## Scenario 3: Video gaming takes over\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation about the video gaming industry’s response to NFTs. Some companies are already offering digital assets as part of [blockchain games](https://www.fintechnews.org/are-blockchain-games-the-future/) such as Ember Sword, but it’s yet to take off in the wider gaming community. This has some experts asking what would happen if it did. Gaming is a huge market and digital assets like NFTs could fit perfectly into that virtual world by offering players the chance to buy unique assets for their games. But for some people, this could blur the lines between playing for fun and playing for profit.\n\n## Scenario 4: The market collapses\n\nSome experts are still skeptical about the future of NFT and believe that any bubble will eventually burst, including crypto. The current frenzy has led to JPEGs selling for millions of dollars with artists and new investors cashing in, but unlike physical artworks, it is still easy for others to make believable copies, which could make it less valuable in the future since it’s a lot easier to make an exact copy of a digital photo than a Rembrandt painting. Fortunately, a lot seems to be pointing away from this scenario and despite what the critics are saying, NFT keeps growing.\n\n \n \n\n \n source:\n\n[https://www.fintechnews.org/](https://www.fintechnews.org/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1656840740, "digest": "oOKrRgUPvBA_DtYCyH_YrwR2RqNBqvCZ-zBJV79iwRI", "contributor": "0xeb4351d692619BA5d00feBefEecdC38C1a26600c"}

We’re presented with an opportunity to reinvent the way we organize in this digital age*.*\n\nIt is critical we seize the occasion. Cyberspace today suffers from a monumental market failure because it has inherited economic rulesets built for the physical world. Yet unlike the old world of flesh and steel, cyberspace is built on information, a substrate which can be freely replicated. This means public goods are far more important to the growth of cyberspace but our markets are ill-equipped to nurture that growth. We are being held back by our inability to reward the creators of these public goods for the clear impact that they have.\n\n**The Optimism Collective** is a new model of **digital democratic governance** optimized to drive rapid and sustained growth of a decentralized ecosystem. The Collective is a band of communities, companies, and citizens united by a mutually beneficial pact to adhere to the axiom of **impact=profit** — the principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual. This axiom serves as a North Star, motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy.\n\nThe Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that **public goods** cannot be **profitable**. The Collective will consistently provide massive [retroactive](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) incentives for public goods which benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. These public goods act as a propellant for the growth of the Collective economy. Growth which yields profit for the Collective and profit which funds more investment in public goods, all together producing a virtuous cycle of impact driven expansion.\n\nWe expect that as the Collective grows, the scope of what falls under the umbrella of Collective public goods will grow along with it. We imagine a future in which the Collective expands beyond the digital realm and into the physical world. The idea that a decentralized ecosystem could reliably provide for basic human needs at scale may seem idealistic today, but it will seem commonplace tomorrow. We start small out of a sense of pragmatism, but we aim big out of an overwhelming sense of Optimism.\n\nTogether, we will create the future of coordinated, collaborative cyberspace.\n\nTogether, we will summon [Ether’s Phoenix](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/x4LGFwa6RJ_opOaCOwr_VGk04Lp3of41H8ynWaFB27E).\n\nStay Optimistic 🔴✨", "timestamp": 1656838985, "digest": "f-o8J4peSET7yKmw2pp4J9jV5fhNoDCLmy2n668-CBw", "contributor": "0x82548e6904D3d95E0f58c0630e5aF70B02f69b8F"}

{"id": "qu6e2PIFiHvGZ5o6JzHFQNQ0gzfzb6UmWOkgqe_1t-w", "title": "Boom or bust? What the future of NFT could look like", "body": "*NFT’s have become a very popular phenomenon across industries and professions, and a wide range of people, from visual artists to musicians, have earned larger sums of money from buying and selling them. But what does the future have in store? Let’s look at a few of the potential scenarios.*\n\nMany years ago, the idea that a GIF or a JPEG file would be considered an art collectible was unthinkable, but today they are known as NFTs, crypto investment assets with a market that surpassed [49 billion dollars in 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-06/nft-market-surpassed-40-billion-in-2021-new-estimate-shows). These unique digital tokens are bought and sold on the internet and many tech investors have seen huge profits.\n\n## Scenario 1: The market slowly stabilizes\n\nWhen innovations pop up, we are quick to dismiss them as pure fantasy. In the 1990s you’d find plenty of people claiming that the internet was unlikely to take off. Similarly, traditional investors were quick to dismiss cryptocurrencies and NFTs when they first made an appearance – but today it’s a booming market. That’s why it has a good chance of becoming an established part of the investment world. To learn more about it, have a look at <https://buynft.com/>. Here, you can explore the latest collections and look at the marketplaces where the trading takes place.\n\n## Scenario 2: NFTs become prime assets in the virtual world\n\nSome venture capitalists not only believe the NFT market will survive but that it will grow bigger and more important. This is because they are counting on our lives becoming more virtual in the years to come. Rather than simply purchasing digital photos, videos, and assets for games, we might soon be [buying real estate and stocks.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/14/stocks-and-property-will-be-turned-into-nfts-vc-says.html) Effectively, this will mean a metaverse in which everything is turned into an NFT token that can be bought with cryptocurrency. How this will coexist with our physical lives in the “real world” is unclear, but the revolution is already on its way.\n\n## Scenario 3: Video gaming takes over\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation about the video gaming industry’s response to NFTs. Some companies are already offering digital assets as part of [blockchain games](https://www.fintechnews.org/are-blockchain-games-the-future/) such as Ember Sword, but it’s yet to take off in the wider gaming community. This has some experts asking what would happen if it did. Gaming is a huge market and digital assets like NFTs could fit perfectly into that virtual world by offering players the chance to buy unique assets for their games. But for some people, this could blur the lines between playing for fun and playing for profit.\n\n## Scenario 4: The market collapses\n\nSome experts are still skeptical about the future of NFT and believe that any bubble will eventually burst, including crypto. The current frenzy has led to JPEGs selling for millions of dollars with artists and new investors cashing in, but unlike physical artworks, it is still easy for others to make believable copies, which could make it less valuable in the future since it’s a lot easier to make an exact copy of a digital photo than a Rembrandt painting. Fortunately, a lot seems to be pointing away from this scenario and despite what the critics are saying, NFT keeps growing.\n\n \n \n\n \n source:\n\n[https://www.fintechnews.org/](https://www.fintechnews.org/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1656840740, "digest": "oOKrRgUPvBA_DtYCyH_YrwR2RqNBqvCZ-zBJV79iwRI", "contributor": "0xeb4351d692619BA5d00feBefEecdC38C1a26600c"}

We’re presented with an opportunity to reinvent the way we organize in this digital age*.*\n\nIt is critical we seize the occasion. Cyberspace today suffers from a monumental market failure because it has inherited economic rulesets built for the physical world. Yet unlike the old world of flesh and steel, cyberspace is built on information, a substrate which can be freely replicated. This means public goods are far more important to the growth of cyberspace but our markets are ill-equipped to nurture that growth. We are being held back by our inability to reward the creators of these public goods for the clear impact that they have.\n\n**The Optimism Collective** is a new model of **digital democratic governance** optimized to drive rapid and sustained growth of a decentralized ecosystem. The Collective is a band of communities, companies, and citizens united by a mutually beneficial pact to adhere to the axiom of **impact=profit** — the principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual. This axiom serves as a North Star, motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy.\n\nThe Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that **public goods** cannot be **profitable**. The Collective will consistently provide massive [retroactive](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) incentives for public goods which benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. These public goods act as a propellant for the growth of the Collective economy. Growth which yields profit for the Collective and profit which funds more investment in public goods, all together producing a virtuous cycle of impact driven expansion.\n\nWe expect that as the Collective grows, the scope of what falls under the umbrella of Collective public goods will grow along with it. We imagine a future in which the Collective expands beyond the digital realm and into the physical world. The idea that a decentralized ecosystem could reliably provide for basic human needs at scale may seem idealistic today, but it will seem commonplace tomorrow. We start small out of a sense of pragmatism, but we aim big out of an overwhelming sense of Optimism.\n\nTogether, we will create the future of coordinated, collaborative cyberspace.\n\nTogether, we will summon [Ether’s Phoenix](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/x4LGFwa6RJ_opOaCOwr_VGk04Lp3of41H8ynWaFB27E).\n\nStay Optimistic 🔴✨", "timestamp": 1656838985, "digest": "f-o8J4peSET7yKmw2pp4J9jV5fhNoDCLmy2n668-CBw", "contributor": "0x82548e6904D3d95E0f58c0630e5aF70B02f69b8F"}

We’re presented with an opportunity to reinvent the way we organize in this digital age*.*\n\nIt is critical we seize the occasion. Cyberspace today suffers from a monumental market failure because it has inherited economic rulesets built for the physical world. Yet unlike the old world of flesh and steel, cyberspace is built on information, a substrate which can be freely replicated. This means public goods are far more important to the growth of cyberspace but our markets are ill-equipped to nurture that growth. We are being held back by our inability to reward the creators of these public goods for the clear impact that they have.\n\n**The Optimism Collective** is a new model of **digital democratic governance** optimized to drive rapid and sustained growth of a decentralized ecosystem. The Collective is a band of communities, companies, and citizens united by a mutually beneficial pact to adhere to the axiom of **impact=profit** — the principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual. This axiom serves as a North Star, motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy.\n\nThe Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that **public goods** cannot be **profitable**. The Collective will consistently provide massive [retroactive](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) incentives for public goods which benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole. These public goods act as a propellant for the growth of the Collective economy. Growth which yields profit for the Collective and profit which funds more investment in public goods, all together producing a virtuous cycle of impact driven expansion.\n\nWe expect that as the Collective grows, the scope of what falls under the umbrella of Collective public goods will grow along with it. We imagine a future in which the Collective expands beyond the digital realm and into the physical world. The idea that a decentralized ecosystem could reliably provide for basic human needs at scale may seem idealistic today, but it will seem commonplace tomorrow. We start small out of a sense of pragmatism, but we aim big out of an overwhelming sense of Optimism.\n\nTogether, we will create the future of coordinated, collaborative cyberspace.\n\nTogether, we will summon [Ether’s Phoenix](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/x4LGFwa6RJ_opOaCOwr_VGk04Lp3of41H8ynWaFB27E).\n\nStay Optimistic 🔴✨", "timestamp": 1656838985, "digest": "f-o8J4peSET7yKmw2pp4J9jV5fhNoDCLmy2n668-CBw", "contributor": "0x82548e6904D3d95E0f58c0630e5aF70B02f69b8F"}

{"id": "wvTZIlIdDmAL4Dj_bKNPy0bWzIMkx5rcUo2dNzVeTpc", "title": "Boom or bust? What the future of NFT could look like", "body": "*NFT’s have become a very popular phenomenon across industries and professions, and a wide range of people, from visual artists to musicians, have earned larger sums of money from buying and selling them. But what does the future have in store? Let’s look at a few of the potential scenarios.*\n\nMany years ago, the idea that a GIF or a JPEG file would be considered an art collectible was unthinkable, but today they are known as NFTs, crypto investment assets with a market that surpassed [49 billion dollars in 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-06/nft-market-surpassed-40-billion-in-2021-new-estimate-shows). These unique digital tokens are bought and sold on the internet and many tech investors have seen huge profits.\n\n## Scenario 1: The market slowly stabilizes\n\nWhen innovations pop up, we are quick to dismiss them as pure fantasy. In the 1990s you’d find plenty of people claiming that the internet was unlikely to take off. Similarly, traditional investors were quick to dismiss cryptocurrencies and NFTs when they first made an appearance – but today it’s a booming market. That’s why it has a good chance of becoming an established part of the investment world. To learn more about it, have a look at <https://buynft.com/>. Here, you can explore the latest collections and look at the marketplaces where the trading takes place.\n\n## Scenario 2: NFTs become prime assets in the virtual world\n\nSome venture capitalists not only believe the NFT market will survive but that it will grow bigger and more important. This is because they are counting on our lives becoming more virtual in the years to come. Rather than simply purchasing digital photos, videos, and assets for games, we might soon be [buying real estate and stocks.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/14/stocks-and-property-will-be-turned-into-nfts-vc-says.html) Effectively, this will mean a metaverse in which everything is turned into an NFT token that can be bought with cryptocurrency. How this will coexist with our physical lives in the “real world” is unclear, but the revolution is already on its way.\n\n## Scenario 3: Video gaming takes over\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation about the video gaming industry’s response to NFTs. Some companies are already offering digital assets as part of [blockchain games](https://www.fintechnews.org/are-blockchain-games-the-future/) such as Ember Sword, but it’s yet to take off in the wider gaming community. This has some experts asking what would happen if it did. Gaming is a huge market and digital assets like NFTs could fit perfectly into that virtual world by offering players the chance to buy unique assets for their games. But for some people, this could blur the lines between playing for fun and playing for profit.\n\n## Scenario 4: The market collapses\n\nSome experts are still skeptical about the future of NFT and believe that any bubble will eventually burst, including crypto. The current frenzy has led to JPEGs selling for millions of dollars with artists and new investors cashing in, but unlike physical artworks, it is still easy for others to make believable copies, which could make it less valuable in the future since it’s a lot easier to make an exact copy of a digital photo than a Rembrandt painting. Fortunately, a lot seems to be pointing away from this scenario and despite what the critics are saying, NFT keeps growing.\n\n \n \n\n \n source:\n\n[https://www.fintechnews.org/](https://www.fintechnews.org/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1656840740, "digest": "oOKrRgUPvBA_DtYCyH_YrwR2RqNBqvCZ-zBJV79iwRI", "contributor": "0xeb4351d692619BA5d00feBefEecdC38C1a26600c"}

Giurgea coined the term “nootropic” in 1972\n\nIt is derived from the Ancient Greek words νόος, meaning “mind”, and τροπή, meaning “a turning”. \n\nGiurgea synthesized [piracetam](https://twitter.com/hashtag/piracetam?src=hashtag_click) in the 1950ies, one of the first putative nootropics:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xItJKPltEFihhYyyrwr6x.jpg?height=817&width=913)\n\nWhile piracetam's potential for cognitive enhancement seems *very limited*, it's only one of hundreds of substances vendors sell on the internet. Many of these novel substances have only been tested on rats.\n\nSome of them are as obscure as they come and **without \\*any\\* safety data**.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohuPpCrnV5bVl53b2/giphy.gif)\n\n### This is where #biohackers come into play.\n\nThey experiment with untested combinations (so-called [#stacks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stacks?src=hashtag_click)) of up to \\~20 substances and post their real-life experiences as “anecdotal evidence” on [@reddit](https://twitter.com/Reddit) boards like /r/Nootropics or /r/Biohackers/. Don't try that at home, kids!\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1ZB9jERWCKcCUAZe8u/giphy.gif)\n\nSome vendors circumvent national regulations by hosting their webshops on offshore-servers or declaring their products as [#researchchemicals](https://twitter.com/hashtag/researchchemicals?src=hashtag_click) for legitimate medical facilities—without actually checking who's buying. \n\nWhen someone gets hurt, there's no accountability whatsoever.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3id8LmtxEqpghrQy2o/giphy.gif)\n\nThe global [#nootropics](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nootropics?src=hashtag_click) market size is projected to reach $5-25 billion in a few years. It's a money printing machine with high margins. I spent some time online chatting with different vendors to gain their trust. Most of them openly admitted to not having any quality checks.\n\nMost stuff is ordered in bulk from [#labs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/labs?src=hashtag_click) in China. A vendor I talked to claimed he could buy fake “Certificates of Authenticity” ([#CoA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoA?src=hashtag_click)) for a little extra – attesting a chemical purity of over 99%. You shouldn't put your health in the hands of some shady backyard lab in China.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/SnwifA7bOFDhe/giphy.gif)\n\nVendors and niche blogs (using affiliate links) seem to control the narrative when it comes to claimed benefits of nootropics. You'll find heaps of “broscience” on how [#modafinil](https://twitter.com/hashtag/modafinil?src=hashtag_click) will help you pass your next exam with flying colors, but a lot less on side effects.

If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n### Sources and further reading: \n\n[https://lexico.com/en/definition/nootropic](https://lexico.com/en/definition/nootropic)\n\n[https://books.google.de/books?id=upjSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false](https://books.google.de/books?id=upjSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n\n[https://webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/features/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview](https://webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/features/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview)\n\n[https://psychologytoday.com/us/blog/engineering-cognitive-experience/201911/the-risks-nootropic-use](https://psychologytoday.com/us/blog/engineering-cognitive-experience/201911/the-risks-nootropic-use)\n\n[https://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(01)06890-8/fulltext](https://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(01)06890-8/fulltext)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-nootropics-market-distribution-channel-160900058.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-nootropics-market-distribution-channel-160900058.html)\n\n[https://bbc.com/news/magazine-35091574 ](https://bbc.com/news/magazine-35091574 )\n\n[https://addcounsel.com/the-dangers-of-smart-drugs/](https://addcounsel.com/the-dangers-of-smart-drugs/)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756795/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756795/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1656842042, "digest": "xAjOMr6GU8oRk12uXnRGL5xT9A6sJkLNf19gkR07EsU", "contributor": "0x81eB8AbBFCADFE9C34b3c24824EBF3D69B9504de"}

Cryptocurrencies, like metal money and paper money, are fungible and can be exchanged as general equivalents. Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are a type of non-fungible token that are inherently different.\n\nNFTs are less monetary-like than normalized tokens because of their unique nature, and they are rarely utilized as cash in the metaverse, instead of serving as a unique identifier of identity and things.\n\nThe metaverse’s economic system is provided by fungible cryptocurrencies, while NFTs supply the metaverse with independent identity and ownership of virtual things. Although they are both based on the blockchain, they are fundamentally different. People appear to have grown accustomed to purchasing NFT using bitcoin, although there are undoubtedly some drawbacks to doing so. If you wish to buy an NFT, you must exchange the type of cryptocurrency needed by the associated seller and then opt to buy it afterward, similar to going to a specific country and needing to exchange the corresponding currency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RLi7vowQtaihI7HGb2UhC.png?height=318&width=785)\n\nNFT Swap is a new transaction method of PlaNFT Marketplace that allows users to exchange NFT transactions directly, saving Gas fees while increasing the efficiency and liquidity of NFT transactions. It presently supports the following four situations.\n\n1. A NFT for B NFT\n2. A NFT+ multiple ERC20 tokens for B NFT\n3. A NFT+B NFT for C NFT\n4.

Eventually, the transaction can be carried out at a price acceptable to both parties, and if they make a deal successful, both sides of the transaction can exchange directly. The entire transaction process eliminates intermediate transaction linkages, requiring only one payment of the Gas Fee, which not only lowers transaction costs but also minimizes transaction time, making it incredibly convenient and quick.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xfle4RKP7o8rz3xXKBv2c.png?height=497&width=1108)\n\nThat’s the new experience of Swap Social + NFT, which integrates NFT trading and social networking, improving NFT liquidity and trading efficiency while building a communication bridge between the two sides of the transaction and successfully expanding the players’ social network.\n\nWe are currently opening the shopping cart function as an NFT trading platform; users can add NFT to the alternative list via the shopping cart to facilitate future searches and purchases.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PcUj2Lcaq5NlQRt_wFL1r.png?height=480&width=854)\n\nWhether you are a Gamefi player or an NFT artist looking to sell your NFT for cryptocurrency to join another Gamefi project or want to swap your work with other NFT artists to enrich your inventory, you can advertise your NFT and corresponding needs on PlaNFT’s SWAP page.\n\nCurrently, PlaNFT has a number of NFTs for trade on its SWAP page and PlaNFT is in talks with several Gamefi projects about collaborating. plaNFT is constantly evolving and we sincerely hope you can join us to help create the PlaNFT metaverse.", "timestamp": 1656916865, "digest": "GWz-e-7IkFrCe_Sxdr07w9RAWGJtGhNXRt3ACZRBx0k", "contributor": "0xb3A71116da831c44101d274b7B905F6c52CF1944"}

{"id": "96bTo--Wn-m9x_LaZo5hV6SEPxG5uS5esww7_DhTCj4", "title": "推动Web3的下一次大爆发", "body": "代币化是 Web 3 的重大突破。它为创新创造了巨大的可能性，但也打开了潘多拉魔盒。\n\n**任何人都可以创建一个代币来代表任何有价值的东西，并在一个开放的网络上根据共同标准来与其他资产进行交易，这是公链出来之前不可想象的事情**。代币化也让许多 Web 3“产品”在短期内获得了吸引力，即使它们本身是不可持续的。\n\n庞氏骗局最终都会崩溃，但这并不能否定这样一个事实——即如果应用在正确的环境中，代币化是一种强大的经济工具，可以促进业务增长。\n\n现实世界中的企业才刚刚意识到代币化的力量， 熊市中投机的消亡为代币化的真正创新提供了喘息的空间。拥有可行产品的公司，如果能够尽早将实用代币纳入现有商业模式，将获得丰厚的回报，同时推动加密货币的采用。\n\n我所说的\\*\\*“实用代币”是指在产品生命周期中有明确用途的代币，而不是让持有者分享公司利润的“股权代币”\\*\\*，后者类似于股票，并且在未来可能会遇到监管方面的障碍。那么传统企业如何从实用代币中受益？ 这里有3种方法：\n\n### 1.用户黏性/用户忠诚度\n\n最简单的实用代币使用案例是作为一个奖励计划——用户越是使用产品，就能获得更多的代币，然后代币可以在未来兑换更多的产品。\n\n忠诚度并不是什么新鲜事——想想飞行常客的里程数记录、星巴克奖励、信用卡积分等， 改变游戏规则的部分是：**允许一个人赚取的“积分”在公共区块链上的二级市场具有流动性**。\n\n这彻底颠覆了传统忠诚度的商业模式。\n\n**传统的用户奖励本质上是歧视性定价**。按使用水平向用户收取不同的价格，可以让公司获得更高的利润——或者用经济术语来说，就是更高的生产者剩余。\n\n这就是航空公司不允许您出售飞行常客里程的原因，如果“批量折扣”可以转让给其他用户，这种商业模式就会崩溃。\n\n但是，如果你把忠诚度代币化，就会发生这样的事情，如果忠诚度积分是可替换的代币，可以在二级市场上进行交易，那么你给每个人的折扣都是一样的，即=代币价格×1个代币可以兑换的产品数量。\n\n那么，为什么企业都想要将忠诚度代币化呢？\n\n因为**尽管代币使得差异化定价成为可能，但它给了用户更强的激励去获得奖励**，因为货币利益可以立即在二级市场上兑现，流动性使代币化奖励比局限在单个产品的忠诚度积分更有吸引力。\n\n从经济角度看，额外的激励措施会使需求曲线向上移动，其幅度与折扣额相等，这表现为用户增长和现有用户的使用量增加。由此产生的均衡价格、数量和生产者剩余都比基本情况下要高。\n\n567a5ab02aadca67ce0d7d789776bc3.png\n\n### 2.为增长的营销支出提供资金，而不影响当前的现金流\n\n2000 年，PayPal 向新用户奖励了数千万美元的注册奖金，以引导其使用。 这是一个很好的激励措施，但却是从公司金库中取出的真实现金。\n\n除非你是一家拥有大型 VC 支持的初创公司，否则其他新公司很难实现这样的增长营销噱头。\n\n但如**果注册奖励是代币形式，则不会影响公司当前的现金状况**。 相反，当用户在未来使用代币兑换公司的产品和服务时，就能收回当时发放的代币。\n\n借助二级市场的流动性，你可以用未来（未实现）的收入来资助今天的增长。这对更多的公司来说，是一种更灵活的营销支出方案。\n\n此外，您可以调整兑换比例，即 X 数量的代币可以兑换 Y 数量的产品，以根据您的产品和二级市场的价格在不同的时间更改您以美元计价的折扣。\n\n## 这种“货币政策”是您可以使用的额外营销杠杆（它还有助于为您的代币设定地板并支持价格稳定）。与传统的奖励计划相比，代币的另一个好处 ——它增加了直接与间接利益相关者的数量。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IPg0hbuKANYRyn4MA7kto.jpg?height=1600&width=2560)\n\n### 3. 扩大利益相关者基础\n\n许多所谓的 Web 3“社区”只不过是投机者希望代币价格上涨的诉求室，建立在这之上的社区在牛市中是强大的，但从长远来看也是脆弱的，甚至是具有破坏性的，更不用说如果持有代币的目标仅仅是价格上涨，你可能还会遇到监管的麻烦。\n\n相反，一个好的货币应该以相对稳定的价格为目的来使用户对代币产生长期信任。 所以应该激励用户赚取更多的代币，而不是让他们坐等代币升值。\n\n即使没有投机的崇拜者，你的代币在二级市场上流通的事实意味着，它能互动的人比你的实际用户数量更多，而且一个具有稳定价值的资产可以被纳入其他金融工具，进一步扩大你的影响力。\n\n那么有哪些类型的公司适合拥有这种代币？几个基本标准：\n\n#### A.你的产品与市场的契合度很低\n\n**为未经市场检验的产品在第一天就发行代币是不明智的**。代币价格的反射性和投机主义的 \"用户 \"会误导你的产品。当潮水退去时（会的），你会发现自己在裸泳。\n\n如果短期内出现用户流失率很高的状况，拥有代币也并不能解决这个问题。 **确保产品具有足够的粘性，维护你所吸引的用户**。\n\n### B. 边际成本\n\n请记住，**代币奖励的发放是以您未来的收入为代价的**。 如果你的边际成本随着用户数量的增加而下降，那就没什么问题。\n\n在这种情况下，获取更多用户是有意义的，因为它可以抵消您的奖励成本，而代币化将帮助您实现目标。 但是，如果你的边际成本持平或者增加，那代币化可能就没什么意义。\n\n### ", "timestamp": 1656843485, "digest": "5PiSi7CxON2Y2WoK38OiyqvzDjZcZ_ASpBgvxKc0wiI", "contributor": "0xB79c8b10df4C63657669ea6c2c74a4DaB245a6Ba"}

{"id": "BDl2-4BBMLyC0QsoCxTglcxSUstSEignbn3GJ77Bp1I", "title": "PlaNFT: NFT for Everyone on This PLANET\nAbout PlaNFT’s concept, we have a lot to say.", "body": "Conceptually speaking, PlaNFT is a trading platform for NFT+ that integrates NFT into the Web3.0 infrastructure while fully using the other functional elements of NFT, aggregating NFT marketplace, NFT casting, club creation, and so on as a single Social Protocol. PlaNFT excellently blends Web2.0 social tools with Web3.0 infrastructure, the true feeling of the block meta-universe constructed with Proof of NFT as the verification technique.\n\nIn terms of vision, PlaNFT is also a platform that helps users create a permission-less De-Social protocol. PlaNFT aspires to be the NFT-based social infrastructure solution. PlaNFT’s goal is to transition the next BILLION people from Web2.0 to Web3.0.\n\nFunctionally speaking, PlaNFT has developed a broad technological framework for transferring Web2.0 users to the Web3.0 Metaverse. PlaNFT is a more user-friendly NFT exchange that supports multichain trading. PlaNFT could also provide Foundation Services to assist conventional businesses in solving problems.\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J802b2trPzV2h8BBi12OS.png?height=383&width=680)\n\nThe reason there is never a definitive statement is that for a decentralized platform, anyone has the right to interpret its meaning and anyone is entitled to use the platform in their way.\n\nThe statement that has received the most votes and has received the highest level of acceptance from us so far is that PlaNFT is a general technical framework built to transfer Web2.0 users to Web3.0 Metaverse.\n\nFinally, it’s crucial to remember why we began the process of constructing PlaNFT in the first place. There are many NFT markets with low entry barriers — why do this in the first place?’ For us, it all boils down to one central goal: ensuring that the benefits of digital property ownership are distributed to the rightful owner — you.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7ZHBb3xeuSXzNPj55X2UM.png?height=590&width=1224)\n\nIn our opinion, more complicated challenges for NFTs have already arrived, yet most first-generation NFT firms — mostly marketplaces — are merely concerned with safeguarding themselves, rather than their communities. Our goal is different. We are committed to assuring the safety and freedom of your NFT transactions.\n\nIf you want to buy NFTs today, for example, you must first read and agree the marketplace’s terms of service. However, a close examination of those contracts reveals that they provide no protection to the author, buyer, or seller. They do not protect you. They were written only for the purpose of protecting the platform and its investors.\n\nThat may sound like it’s just a few words moved around, but what it means is that NFT creators cannot create, link, or enforce their terms (whether those are permissive or restrictive) to an NFT. At the same time, buyers and sellers cannot protect themselves if something goes sideways with their transaction (i.e., buy, sell, swap, rent, lend, lease license, etc.).This certainly runs counter to the idea of decentralization.\n\nThis is ‘why PlaNFT,’ and how we want to ensure that everyone benefits in a web3 future while also breaking the stranglehold of rent-seeking web2 platforms where you have no rights and are the product. We’ll start bringing out more features once the underlying platform and transactional flows are out of beta.\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ElDwssTpBD0MoKwk12wU_.png?height=329&width=585)\n\nWith that said, if you’ve been joining our Discord Community calls or Telegram groups, this isn’t the first time you’ve heard us get passionate about our vision. If you’re just discovering us, we invite you to dig into our past interviews with NFT+and No-key wallet.\n\nWe also invite NFT creators to join our Metaverse and produce additional NFTs; if you are an online influencer,want to build a private club or shelve a lot of NFT works, please contact us for further information and business collaboration; we would be delighted to hear from you and respond as soon as possible.", "timestamp": 1656915785, "digest": "QNU7xiIWLofvursF4hsbtvVq-kgXwD73AdI2DwBYpsY", "contributor": "0xb3A71116da831c44101d274b7B905F6c52CF1944"}

{"id": "bPCjSv-FZunJLUnV12phgqmDNtXSrZIcErMvN87WDVg", "title": "推动Web3的下一次大爆发", "body": "代币化是 Web 3 的重大突破。它为创新创造了巨大的可能性，但也打开了潘多拉魔盒。\n\n**任何人都可以创建一个代币来代表任何有价值的东西，并在一个开放的网络上根据共同标准来与其他资产进行交易，这是公链出来之前不可想象的事情**。代币化也让许多 Web 3“产品”在短期内获得了吸引力，即使它们本身是不可持续的。\n\n庞氏骗局最终都会崩溃，但这并不能否定这样一个事实——即如果应用在正确的环境中，代币化是一种强大的经济工具，可以促进业务增长。\n\n现实世界中的企业才刚刚意识到代币化的力量， 熊市中投机的消亡为代币化的真正创新提供了喘息的空间。拥有可行产品的公司，如果能够尽早将实用代币纳入现有商业模式，将获得丰厚的回报，同时推动加密货币的采用。\n\n我所说的\\*\\*“实用代币”是指在产品生命周期中有明确用途的代币，而不是让持有者分享公司利润的“股权代币”\\*\\*，后者类似于股票，并且在未来可能会遇到监管方面的障碍。那么传统企业如何从实用代币中受益？ 这里有3种方法：\n\n### 1.用户黏性/用户忠诚度\n\n最简单的实用代币使用案例是作为一个奖励计划——用户越是使用产品，就能获得更多的代币，然后代币可以在未来兑换更多的产品。\n\n忠诚度并不是什么新鲜事——想想飞行常客的里程数记录、星巴克奖励、信用卡积分等， 改变游戏规则的部分是：**允许一个人赚取的“积分”在公共区块链上的二级市场具有流动性**。\n\n这彻底颠覆了传统忠诚度的商业模式。\n\n**传统的用户奖励本质上是歧视性定价**。按使用水平向用户收取不同的价格，可以让公司获得更高的利润——或者用经济术语来说，就是更高的生产者剩余。\n\n这就是航空公司不允许您出售飞行常客里程的原因，如果“批量折扣”可以转让给其他用户，这种商业模式就会崩溃。\n\n但是，如果你把忠诚度代币化，就会发生这样的事情，如果忠诚度积分是可替换的代币，可以在二级市场上进行交易，那么你给每个人的折扣都是一样的，即=代币价格×1个代币可以兑换的产品数量。\n\n那么，为什么企业都想要将忠诚度代币化呢？\n\n因为**尽管代币使得差异化定价成为可能，但它给了用户更强的激励去获得奖励**，因为货币利益可以立即在二级市场上兑现，流动性使代币化奖励比局限在单个产品的忠诚度积分更有吸引力。\n\n从经济角度看，额外的激励措施会使需求曲线向上移动，其幅度与折扣额相等，这表现为用户增长和现有用户的使用量增加。由此产生的均衡价格、数量和生产者剩余都比基本情况下要高。\n\n567a5ab02aadca67ce0d7d789776bc3.png\n\n### 2.为增长的营销支出提供资金，而不影响当前的现金流\n\n2000 年，PayPal 向新用户奖励了数千万美元的注册奖金，以引导其使用。 这是一个很好的激励措施，但却是从公司金库中取出的真实现金。\n\n除非你是一家拥有大型 VC 支持的初创公司，否则其他新公司很难实现这样的增长营销噱头。\n\n但如**果注册奖励是代币形式，则不会影响公司当前的现金状况**。 相反，当用户在未来使用代币兑换公司的产品和服务时，就能收回当时发放的代币。\n\n借助二级市场的流动性，你可以用未来（未实现）的收入来资助今天的增长。这对更多的公司来说，是一种更灵活的营销支出方案。\n\n此外，您可以调整兑换比例，即 X 数量的代币可以兑换 Y 数量的产品，以根据您的产品和二级市场的价格在不同的时间更改您以美元计价的折扣。\n\n## 这种“货币政策”是您可以使用的额外营销杠杆（它还有助于为您的代币设定地板并支持价格稳定）。与传统的奖励计划相比，代币的另一个好处 ——它增加了直接与间接利益相关者的数量。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IPg0hbuKANYRyn4MA7kto.jpg?height=1600&width=2560)\n\n### 3. 扩大利益相关者基础\n\n许多所谓的 Web 3“社区”只不过是投机者希望代币价格上涨的诉求室，建立在这之上的社区在牛市中是强大的，但从长远来看也是脆弱的，甚至是具有破坏性的，更不用说如果持有代币的目标仅仅是价格上涨，你可能还会遇到监管的麻烦。\n\n相反，一个好的货币应该以相对稳定的价格为目的来使用户对代币产生长期信任。 所以应该激励用户赚取更多的代币，而不是让他们坐等代币升值。\n\n即使没有投机的崇拜者，你的代币在二级市场上流通的事实意味着，它能互动的人比你的实际用户数量更多，而且一个具有稳定价值的资产可以被纳入其他金融工具，进一步扩大你的影响力。\n\n那么有哪些类型的公司适合拥有这种代币？几个基本标准：\n\n#### A.你的产品与市场的契合度很低\n\n**为未经市场检验的产品在第一天就发行代币是不明智的**。代币价格的反射性和投机主义的 \"用户 \"会误导你的产品。当潮水退去时（会的），你会发现自己在裸泳。\n\n如果短期内出现用户流失率很高的状况，拥有代币也并不能解决这个问题。 **确保产品具有足够的粘性，维护你所吸引的用户**。\n\n### B. 边际成本\n\n请记住，**代币奖励的发放是以您未来的收入为代价的**。 如果你的边际成本随着用户数量的增加而下降，那就没什么问题。\n\n在这种情况下，获取更多用户是有意义的，因为它可以抵消您的奖励成本，而代币化将帮助您实现目标。 但是，如果你的边际成本持平或者增加，那代币化可能就没什么意义。\n\n### ", "timestamp": 1656843485, "digest": "5PiSi7CxON2Y2WoK38OiyqvzDjZcZ_ASpBgvxKc0wiI", "contributor": "0xB79c8b10df4C63657669ea6c2c74a4DaB245a6Ba"}

Giurgea coined the term “nootropic” in 1972\n\nIt is derived from the Ancient Greek words νόος, meaning “mind”, and τροπή, meaning “a turning”. \n\nGiurgea synthesized [piracetam](https://twitter.com/hashtag/piracetam?src=hashtag_click) in the 1950ies, one of the first putative nootropics:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xItJKPltEFihhYyyrwr6x.jpg?height=817&width=913)\n\nWhile piracetam's potential for cognitive enhancement seems *very limited*, it's only one of hundreds of substances vendors sell on the internet. Many of these novel substances have only been tested on rats.\n\nSome of them are as obscure as they come and **without \\*any\\* safety data**.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohuPpCrnV5bVl53b2/giphy.gif)\n\n### This is where #biohackers come into play.\n\nThey experiment with untested combinations (so-called [#stacks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stacks?src=hashtag_click)) of up to \\~20 substances and post their real-life experiences as “anecdotal evidence” on [@reddit](https://twitter.com/Reddit) boards like /r/Nootropics or /r/Biohackers/. Don't try that at home, kids!\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1ZB9jERWCKcCUAZe8u/giphy.gif)\n\nSome vendors circumvent national regulations by hosting their webshops on offshore-servers or declaring their products as [#researchchemicals](https://twitter.com/hashtag/researchchemicals?src=hashtag_click) for legitimate medical facilities—without actually checking who's buying. \n\nWhen someone gets hurt, there's no accountability whatsoever.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3id8LmtxEqpghrQy2o/giphy.gif)\n\nThe global [#nootropics](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nootropics?src=hashtag_click) market size is projected to reach $5-25 billion in a few years. It's a money printing machine with high margins. I spent some time online chatting with different vendors to gain their trust. Most of them openly admitted to not having any quality checks.\n\nMost stuff is ordered in bulk from [#labs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/labs?src=hashtag_click) in China. A vendor I talked to claimed he could buy fake “Certificates of Authenticity” ([#CoA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoA?src=hashtag_click)) for a little extra – attesting a chemical purity of over 99%. You shouldn't put your health in the hands of some shady backyard lab in China.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/SnwifA7bOFDhe/giphy.gif)\n\nVendors and niche blogs (using affiliate links) seem to control the narrative when it comes to claimed benefits of nootropics. You'll find heaps of “broscience” on how [#modafinil](https://twitter.com/hashtag/modafinil?src=hashtag_click) will help you pass your next exam with flying colors, but a lot less on side effects. [#redflag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/redflag?src=hashtag_click)\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/9McnpKk3degVAkK9BY/giphy.gif)\n\n### It turns out, when it comes to drugs, there's no free lunch\n\nLike many medications, nootropics can cause *downregulation* of a variety of receptors, leading to tolerance development, diminishing returns and ultimately dependence. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n### Sources and further reading: \n\n[https://lexico.com/en/definition/nootropic](https://lexico.com/en/definition/nootropic)\n\n[https://books.google.de/books?id=upjSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false](https://books.google.de/books?id=upjSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n\n[https://webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/features/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview](https://webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/features/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview)\n\n[https://psychologytoday.com/us/blog/engineering-cognitive-experience/201911/the-risks-nootropic-use](https://psychologytoday.com/us/blog/engineering-cognitive-experience/201911/the-risks-nootropic-use)\n\n[https://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(01)06890-8/fulltext](https://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(01)06890-8/fulltext)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-nootropics-market-distribution-channel-160900058.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-nootropics-market-distribution-channel-160900058.html)\n\n[https://bbc.com/news/magazine-35091574 ](https://bbc.com/news/magazine-35091574 )\n\n[https://addcounsel.com/the-dangers-of-smart-drugs/](https://addcounsel.com/the-dangers-of-smart-drugs/)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756795/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756795/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1656842042, "digest": "xAjOMr6GU8oRk12uXnRGL5xT9A6sJkLNf19gkR07EsU", "contributor": "0x81eB8AbBFCADFE9C34b3c24824EBF3D69B9504de"}

Giurgea coined the term “nootropic” in 1972\n\nIt is derived from the Ancient Greek words νόος, meaning “mind”, and τροπή, meaning “a turning”. \n\nGiurgea synthesized [piracetam](https://twitter.com/hashtag/piracetam?src=hashtag_click) in the 1950ies, one of the first putative nootropics:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xItJKPltEFihhYyyrwr6x.jpg?height=817&width=913)\n\nWhile piracetam's potential for cognitive enhancement seems *very limited*, it's only one of hundreds of substances vendors sell on the internet. Many of these novel substances have only been tested on rats.\n\nSome of them are as obscure as they come and **without \\*any\\* safety data**.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohuPpCrnV5bVl53b2/giphy.gif)\n\n### This is where #biohackers come into play.\n\nThey experiment with untested combinations (so-called [#stacks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stacks?src=hashtag_click)) of up to \\~20 substances and post their real-life experiences as “anecdotal evidence” on [@reddit](https://twitter.com/Reddit) boards like /r/Nootropics or /r/Biohackers/. Don't try that at home, kids!\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1ZB9jERWCKcCUAZe8u/giphy.gif)\n\nSome vendors circumvent national regulations by hosting their webshops on offshore-servers or declaring their products as [#researchchemicals](https://twitter.com/hashtag/researchchemicals?src=hashtag_click) for legitimate medical facilities—without actually checking who's buying. \n\nWhen someone gets hurt, there's no accountability whatsoever.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3id8LmtxEqpghrQy2o/giphy.gif)\n\nThe global [#nootropics](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nootropics?src=hashtag_click) market size is projected to reach $5-25 billion in a few years. It's a money printing machine with high margins. I spent some time online chatting with different vendors to gain their trust. Most of them openly admitted to not having any quality checks.\n\nMost stuff is ordered in bulk from [#labs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/labs?src=hashtag_click) in China. A vendor I talked to claimed he could buy fake “Certificates of Authenticity” ([#CoA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoA?src=hashtag_click)) for a little extra – attesting a chemical purity of over 99%. You shouldn't put your health in the hands of some shady backyard lab in China.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/SnwifA7bOFDhe/giphy.gif)\n\nVendors and niche blogs (using affiliate links) seem to control the narrative when it comes to claimed benefits of nootropics.

They believe that the Internet has long been full of holes and the 4 attributes mentioned above are just stages that the Internet will inevitably go through in its development, but they are not enough to constitute web 3.0.", "timestamp": 1656843158, "digest": "1L83mCedg8HL1pSI2rMEYpgial15Gm0vzyisWacvnwo", "contributor": "0x7593525423b6d31e3DF66050939Da799A8839dA4"}

Giurgea coined the term “nootropic” in 1972\n\nIt is derived from the Ancient Greek words νόος, meaning “mind”, and τροπή, meaning “a turning”. \n\nGiurgea synthesized [piracetam](https://twitter.com/hashtag/piracetam?src=hashtag_click) in the 1950ies, one of the first putative nootropics:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xItJKPltEFihhYyyrwr6x.jpg?height=817&width=913)\n\nWhile piracetam's potential for cognitive enhancement seems *very limited*, it's only one of hundreds of substances vendors sell on the internet. Many of these novel substances have only been tested on rats.\n\nSome of them are as obscure as they come and **without \\*any\\* safety data**.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohuPpCrnV5bVl53b2/giphy.gif)\n\n### This is where #biohackers come into play.\n\nThey experiment with untested combinations (so-called [#stacks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stacks?src=hashtag_click)) of up to \\~20 substances and post their real-life experiences as “anecdotal evidence” on [@reddit](https://twitter.com/Reddit) boards like /r/Nootropics or /r/Biohackers/. Don't try that at home, kids!\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1ZB9jERWCKcCUAZe8u/giphy.gif)\n\nSome vendors circumvent national regulations by hosting their webshops on offshore-servers or declaring their products as [#researchchemicals](https://twitter.com/hashtag/researchchemicals?src=hashtag_click) for legitimate medical facilities—without actually checking who's buying. \n\nWhen someone gets hurt, there's no accountability whatsoever.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3id8LmtxEqpghrQy2o/giphy.gif)\n\nThe global [#nootropics](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nootropics?src=hashtag_click) market size is projected to reach $5-25 billion in a few years. It's a money printing machine with high margins. I spent some time online chatting with different vendors to gain their trust. Most of them openly admitted to not having any quality checks.\n\nMost stuff is ordered in bulk from [#labs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/labs?src=hashtag_click) in China. A vendor I talked to claimed he could buy fake “Certificates of Authenticity” ([#CoA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoA?src=hashtag_click)) for a little extra – attesting a chemical purity of over 99%. You shouldn't put your health in the hands of some shady backyard lab in China.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/SnwifA7bOFDhe/giphy.gif)\n\nVendors and niche blogs (using affiliate links) seem to control the narrative when it comes to claimed benefits of nootropics. You'll find heaps of “broscience” on how [#modafinil](https://twitter.com/hashtag/modafinil?src=hashtag_click) will help you pass your next exam with flying colors, but a lot less on side effects. [#redflag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/redflag?src=hashtag_click)\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/9McnpKk3degVAkK9BY/giphy.gif)\n\n### It turns out, when it comes to drugs, there's no free lunch\n\nLike many medications, nootropics can cause *downregulation* of a variety of receptors, leading to tolerance development, diminishing returns and ultimately dependence. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n### Sources and further reading: \n\n[https://lexico.com/en/definition/nootropic](https://lexico.com/en/definition/nootropic)\n\n[https://books.google.de/books?id=upjSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false](https://books.google.de/books?id=upjSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n\n[https://webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/features/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview](https://webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/features/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview)\n\n[https://psychologytoday.com/us/blog/engineering-cognitive-experience/201911/the-risks-nootropic-use](https://psychologytoday.com/us/blog/engineering-cognitive-experience/201911/the-risks-nootropic-use)\n\n[https://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(01)06890-8/fulltext](https://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(01)06890-8/fulltext)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-nootropics-market-distribution-channel-160900058.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-nootropics-market-distribution-channel-160900058.html)\n\n[https://bbc.com/news/magazine-35091574 ](https://bbc.com/news/magazine-35091574 )\n\n[https://addcounsel.com/the-dangers-of-smart-drugs/](https://addcounsel.com/the-dangers-of-smart-drugs/)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756795/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756795/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1656842042, "digest": "xAjOMr6GU8oRk12uXnRGL5xT9A6sJkLNf19gkR07EsU", "contributor": "0x81eB8AbBFCADFE9C34b3c24824EBF3D69B9504de"}

Optimism用户：这个很容易满足，因为mirror用optimism，只要你在mirror上写过文章或者铸造NFT就算满足条件，而且gas费为0。\n2. 重复Optimism用户：在optimism的应用上，每周至少执行一次交易，至少四周以上。如果是mirror的重度用户就可以满足，每周发表一篇文章或者铸造一个NFT就可以啦。\n3. DAO投票者：可以在链上发起或者参与投票至少一次，例如，\\*Governor Alpha and Bravo, Aave, Curve, Maker, Aragon, DAOHaus, DAOStack, and forks。\\*在Snapshot上至少发起或投票两次。注意：会过滤掉活跃的投票者，如果你发起过至少5次提案并且投票，会被过滤掉哦。\n\n   <https://snapshot.org/#/>\n4. 多重签名者：多重签名钱包通过由多个设备，例如，硬件钱包，metamask钱包，或者多个设备组合确认交易的执行，从而提高加密资产的安全性。多重签名钱包的签名者，至少执行十次交易才能满足空投要求，设置多重签名钱包和执行交易都需要支付gas费，在ETH上的gas费大概要几十到上百美金。多重签名钱包包括：*Gnosis Safe v0.1.0-1.3.0, MultiSigWithDailyLimit, MultiSigWalletWithTimeLock。*\n\n   <https://gnosis-safe.io/>\n5. Gitcoin捐赠者：在Gitcoin的layer1上，做出过链上捐赠。\n\n   <https://gitcoin.co/>\n6. ETH链价值输出用户：把资产从ETH通过Bridge技术转移到其他公链或者Layer2，并且在跨链之后每周执行两次交易，公链包括\\*BSC, Fantom, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon; Layer2包括Arbtirum, Optimism, Metis, Boba。\\*桥接之后每个月仍然在ETH上执行至少一次交易。注意：从ETH桥接到其他公链或L2的费用都比较高，如果不需要做跨链转移资产的话，不必为了领空投去操作。从ETH转移资产到optimism，是符合空投要求的，但是转移资产后要在optimism上每周执行至少两次交易，同时每个月还要在ETH上执行至少一次交易。\n\n   <https://app.optimism.io/bridge>\n\n#### 额外奖金：满足四项条件以上就会得到额外空投奖励。\n\n个人建议：\n\n满足前三项条件还是很容易的，不需要gas费，一定要试试。\n\n第5项Gitcoin捐赠项目，最少只要几美金，而且满足这项条件之后，还可以获得额外空投奖励。建议尝试。\n\n第4和6项条件需要的gas费比较高，如果不是真的有需要，不必为了领空投去尝试。", "timestamp": 1656904204, "digest": "VdNT2yb7sXbbl-e-WmUxUatdxPmCbxU4LLw9Rseaecg", "contributor": "0xd00e2c85021d016e52849C167232e4De7e2d5DEC"}

{"id": "NwCoxGMaiXHt0yfj_iBuvZhh36fzIFg-5y6SB8KxMtU", "title": "PlaNFT: Functional Introduction & Prospect", "body": "Through the previous article, you have understood what PlaNFT is, so let’s talk about the functions of PlaNFT and the vision of the future.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FWlZgkpMGVf2GttmRKo0S.png?height=623&width=1106)\n\nFirst of all, let’s start with the trading function of NFT, as a trading platform for NFT, PlaNFT supports cross-chain and multi-currency transactions, the trading market is very simple and clear, in the trading method, PlaNFT provides British and Dutch auctions, you can batch one-click to shelve NFT works, one-click to buy multiple NFT, only charge once Gas fee, which is very convenient and efficient to use.\n\nPlaNFT supports not only image format NFT collections, audio and video NFT can also be uploaded and sold, and there is a unique hundreds of costume change mode for users to create virtual images in the PlaNFT metaverse.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l7GGrWeBpFUpdHe_2h-YU.png?height=532&width=1105)\n\nIn the PlaNFT metaverse, many users are bound to have especially memorable moments, such as successfully bidding on a desired NFT, reaching 1,000 followers in a club, or reaching 100,000-worth of NFT turnover in their Mint.\n\nPlaNFT provides this feature for users, who can hash-cast their memorable moments as NFTs and leave their footprints on the blockchain.\n\nPlaNFT platform supports users to comment on NFT, buyers can see the comments below the NFT to decide whether to buy, and sellers can promote NFT in the comments section, which is the social attributes of PlaNFT exclusive, in the current market, very few NFT trading platforms can do that.\n\nWhy PlaNFT is different from other NFT trading platforms is because, at PlaNFT, NFT is not only JPG pictures, it also has social functions, KOL launched time rentals through NFT, and fans can subscribe to that NFT, enter the club, can interact with KOL, get acquainted with KOL exclusive news, and enjoy the society’s services; KOL then realizes fans’ economic realizations, improves fans’ adherence, creates a high Net Worth Club, and therefore helpful in screening whitelist and airdrop users.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FvGEX4PyRS9tRCCkGjmjN.png?height=534&width=1107)\n\nAfter knowing the features we already have so far, we would like to introduce you, to the features that will be coming soon to PlaNFT.\n\n## Function 1: SWAP\n\nThere are few NFT trading platforms on the market with a Swap function, and in response to this, PlaNFT created the unique SWAP system and intends to officially launch it in the next version update. At present, player A wants to buy BAYC, there is a moonwords and 100U in the pocket, if there is no Swap function, he needs to sell the moonwords first, and then go to buy BAYC, the middle transaction was two times, and needs to spend twice gas fee, with the SWAP function, agreed by the other party, he can directly exchange BAYC with a moonwords + 100U, which means you can exchange BAYC directly, less a transaction process, not only save the gas fee, the transaction time is also shortened, making NFT transactions more efficient.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AxC6VBWjr4qD_FpQmpTcr.png?height=533&width=1107)\n\n## Function 2: Polymerization trading\n\nPlaNFT is committed to creating an all-platform NFT polymerization transaction, is promoting cooperation with various NFT trading platforms, in the future, users can retrieve NFT through PLANFT to all platforms, a key to participate in any platform NFT transactions, both worry-free and efficient, security issues can also be guaranteed.\n\n## Function 3: Wallet2.0 Keyless Wallet\n\nFor metaverse newbies, the barrier of using a traditional decentralized wallet is high, which requires users to download the wallet plug-in and keep the private key properly, once the private key is lost, all their properties will go down the drain. As a plugin for a webpage or APP, the wallet needs to switch back and forth in the process of using, which causes great inconvenience. Therefore, PlaNFT has launched a non-key(Keyless) wallet, which only needs to bind Google or Facebook account to automatically obtain a permanent wallet address, and can be used cross-platform, every usage only requires Google authorization, without multi-page skipping.\n\nTime-saving, effort-saving, and high efficiency are the concepts that PlaNFT advocates at all times, which should also be the future of metaverse. We sincerely hope that every user enjoys a wonderful experience when using PlaNFT, for which we have prepared a guidebook for using the PlaNFT platform for you, and you may also join the group chat of our platforms and talk to the admin for help personally. We always give feedback whenever receiving your questions. And again, have fun exploring the PlaNFT metaverse.", "timestamp": 1656916156, "digest": "CuhWxv93vgEqKO1NMg1OtgTMo2nj7s7oBWuZgCE9oME", "contributor": "0xb3A71116da831c44101d274b7B905F6c52CF1944"}

Cryptocurrencies, like metal money and paper money, are fungible and can be exchanged as general equivalents. Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are a type of non-fungible token that are inherently different.\n\nNFTs are less monetary-like than normalized tokens because of their unique nature, and they are rarely utilized as cash in the metaverse, instead of serving as a unique identifier of identity and things.\n\nThe metaverse’s economic system is provided by fungible cryptocurrencies, while NFTs supply the metaverse with independent identity and ownership of virtual things. Although they are both based on the blockchain, they are fundamentally different. People appear to have grown accustomed to purchasing NFT using bitcoin, although there are undoubtedly some drawbacks to doing so. If you wish to buy an NFT, you must exchange the type of cryptocurrency needed by the associated seller and then opt to buy it afterward, similar to going to a specific country and needing to exchange the corresponding currency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RLi7vowQtaihI7HGb2UhC.png?height=318&width=785)\n\nNFT Swap is a new transaction method of PlaNFT Marketplace that allows users to exchange NFT transactions directly, saving Gas fees while increasing the efficiency and liquidity of NFT transactions. It presently supports the following four situations.\n\n1. A NFT for B NFT\n2. A NFT+ multiple ERC20 tokens for B NFT\n3. A NFT+B NFT for C NFT\n4. A NFT+ multiple ERC20 tokens to B NFT+ multiple ERC20 tokens\n\nHarvey can exchange with James for 100ETH + his Moonbirds NFT if James has a BAYC NFT worth 130ETH to sell and Harvey has a Moonbirds worth 30ETH and wants to buy James’ BAYC. If James agrees to swap, the transaction can be completed using the Swap function on the PlaNFT platform.\n\nJames can also add Harvey as a friend through the Telegram account he left on the PlaNFT platform for private communication. Eventually, the transaction can be carried out at a price acceptable to both parties, and if they make a deal successful, both sides of the transaction can exchange directly. The entire transaction process eliminates intermediate transaction linkages, requiring only one payment of the Gas Fee, which not only lowers transaction costs but also minimizes transaction time, making it incredibly convenient and quick.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xfle4RKP7o8rz3xXKBv2c.png?height=497&width=1108)\n\nThat’s the new experience of Swap Social + NFT, which integrates NFT trading and social networking, improving NFT liquidity and trading efficiency while building a communication bridge between the two sides of the transaction and successfully expanding the players’ social network.\n\nWe are currently opening the shopping cart function as an NFT trading platform; users can add NFT to the alternative list via the shopping cart to facilitate future searches and purchases.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PcUj2Lcaq5NlQRt_wFL1r.png?height=480&width=854)\n\nWhether you are a Gamefi player or an NFT artist looking to sell your NFT for cryptocurrency to join another Gamefi project or want to swap your work with other NFT artists to enrich your inventory, you can advertise your NFT and corresponding needs on PlaNFT’s SWAP page.\n\nCurrently, PlaNFT has a number of NFTs for trade on its SWAP page and PlaNFT is in talks with several Gamefi projects about collaborating. plaNFT is constantly evolving and we sincerely hope you can join us to help create the PlaNFT metaverse.", "timestamp": 1656916865, "digest": "GWz-e-7IkFrCe_Sxdr07w9RAWGJtGhNXRt3ACZRBx0k", "contributor": "0xb3A71116da831c44101d274b7B905F6c52CF1944"}

{"id": "UsTC6Qb6zlf8mf8P8J2Pz2QNPX88oS8Vn2kktdFUvV4", "title": "PlaNFT: Functional Introduction & Prospect", "body": "Through the previous article, you have understood what PlaNFT is, so let’s talk about the functions of PlaNFT and the vision of the future.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FWlZgkpMGVf2GttmRKo0S.png?height=623&width=1106)\n\nFirst of all, let’s start with the trading function of NFT, as a trading platform for NFT, PlaNFT supports cross-chain and multi-currency transactions, the trading market is very simple and clear, in the trading method, PlaNFT provides British and Dutch auctions, you can batch one-click to shelve NFT works, one-click to buy multiple NFT, only charge once Gas fee, which is very convenient and efficient to use.\n\nPlaNFT supports not only image format NFT collections, audio and video NFT can also be uploaded and sold, and there is a unique hundreds of costume change mode for users to create virtual images in the PlaNFT metaverse.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l7GGrWeBpFUpdHe_2h-YU.png?height=532&width=1105)\n\nIn the PlaNFT metaverse, many users are bound to have especially memorable moments, such as successfully bidding on a desired NFT, reaching 1,000 followers in a club, or reaching 100,000-worth of NFT turnover in their Mint.\n\nPlaNFT provides this feature for users, who can hash-cast their memorable moments as NFTs and leave their footprints on the blockchain.\n\nPlaNFT platform supports users to comment on NFT, buyers can see the comments below the NFT to decide whether to buy, and sellers can promote NFT in the comments section, which is the social attributes of PlaNFT exclusive, in the current market, very few NFT trading platforms can do that.\n\nWhy PlaNFT is different from other NFT trading platforms is because, at PlaNFT, NFT is not only JPG pictures, it also has social functions, KOL launched time rentals through NFT, and fans can subscribe to that NFT, enter the club, can interact with KOL, get acquainted with KOL exclusive news, and enjoy the society’s services; KOL then realizes fans’ economic realizations, improves fans’ adherence, creates a high Net Worth Club, and therefore helpful in screening whitelist and airdrop users.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FvGEX4PyRS9tRCCkGjmjN.png?height=534&width=1107)\n\nAfter knowing the features we already have so far, we would like to introduce you, to the features that will be coming soon to PlaNFT.\n\n## Function 1: SWAP\n\nThere are few NFT trading platforms on the market with a Swap function, and in response to this, PlaNFT created the unique SWAP system and intends to officially launch it in the next version update. At present, player A wants to buy BAYC, there is a moonwords and 100U in the pocket, if there is no Swap function, he needs to sell the moonwords first, and then go to buy BAYC, the middle transaction was two times, and needs to spend twice gas fee, with the SWAP function, agreed by the other party, he can directly exchange BAYC with a moonwords + 100U, which means you can exchange BAYC directly, less a transaction process, not only save the gas fee, the transaction time is also shortened, making NFT transactions more efficient.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AxC6VBWjr4qD_FpQmpTcr.png?height=533&width=1107)\n\n## Function 2: Polymerization trading\n\nPlaNFT is committed to creating an all-platform NFT polymerization transaction, is promoting cooperation with various NFT trading platforms, in the future, users can retrieve NFT through PLANFT to all platforms, a key to participate in any platform NFT transactions, both worry-free and efficient, security issues can also be guaranteed.\n\n## Function 3: Wallet2.0 Keyless Wallet\n\nFor metaverse newbies, the barrier of using a traditional decentralized wallet is high, which requires users to download the wallet plug-in and keep the private key properly, once the private key is lost, all their properties will go down the drain. As a plugin for a webpage or APP, the wallet needs to switch back and forth in the process of using, which causes great inconvenience. Therefore, PlaNFT has launched a non-key(Keyless) wallet, which only needs to bind Google or Facebook account to automatically obtain a permanent wallet address, and can be used cross-platform, every usage only requires Google authorization, without multi-page skipping.\n\nTime-saving, effort-saving, and high efficiency are the concepts that PlaNFT advocates at all times, which should also be the future of metaverse. We sincerely hope that every user enjoys a wonderful experience when using PlaNFT, for which we have prepared a guidebook for using the PlaNFT platform for you, and you may also join the group chat of our platforms and talk to the admin for help personally. We always give feedback whenever receiving your questions. And again, have fun exploring the PlaNFT metaverse.", "timestamp": 1656916156, "digest": "CuhWxv93vgEqKO1NMg1OtgTMo2nj7s7oBWuZgCE9oME", "contributor": "0xb3A71116da831c44101d274b7B905F6c52CF1944"}

{"id": "y50JyWoltG17z0Y9WnAxZmiy_k8FneXEyrY-x2jgsKU", "title": "推动Web3的下一次大爆发", "body": "代币化是 Web 3 的重大突破。它为创新创造了巨大的可能性，但也打开了潘多拉魔盒。\n\n**任何人都可以创建一个代币来代表任何有价值的东西，并在一个开放的网络上根据共同标准来与其他资产进行交易，这是公链出来之前不可想象的事情**。代币化也让许多 Web 3“产品”在短期内获得了吸引力，即使它们本身是不可持续的。\n\n庞氏骗局最终都会崩溃，但这并不能否定这样一个事实——即如果应用在正确的环境中，代币化是一种强大的经济工具，可以促进业务增长。\n\n现实世界中的企业才刚刚意识到代币化的力量， 熊市中投机的消亡为代币化的真正创新提供了喘息的空间。拥有可行产品的公司，如果能够尽早将实用代币纳入现有商业模式，将获得丰厚的回报，同时推动加密货币的采用。\n\n我所说的\\*\\*“实用代币”是指在产品生命周期中有明确用途的代币，而不是让持有者分享公司利润的“股权代币”\\*\\*，后者类似于股票，并且在未来可能会遇到监管方面的障碍。那么传统企业如何从实用代币中受益？ 这里有3种方法：\n\n### 1.用户黏性/用户忠诚度\n\n最简单的实用代币使用案例是作为一个奖励计划——用户越是使用产品，就能获得更多的代币，然后代币可以在未来兑换更多的产品。\n\n忠诚度并不是什么新鲜事——想想飞行常客的里程数记录、星巴克奖励、信用卡积分等， 改变游戏规则的部分是：**允许一个人赚取的“积分”在公共区块链上的二级市场具有流动性**。\n\n这彻底颠覆了传统忠诚度的商业模式。\n\n**传统的用户奖励本质上是歧视性定价**。按使用水平向用户收取不同的价格，可以让公司获得更高的利润——或者用经济术语来说，就是更高的生产者剩余。\n\n这就是航空公司不允许您出售飞行常客里程的原因，如果“批量折扣”可以转让给其他用户，这种商业模式就会崩溃。\n\n但是，如果你把忠诚度代币化，就会发生这样的事情，如果忠诚度积分是可替换的代币，可以在二级市场上进行交易，那么你给每个人的折扣都是一样的，即=代币价格×1个代币可以兑换的产品数量。\n\n那么，为什么企业都想要将忠诚度代币化呢？\n\n因为**尽管代币使得差异化定价成为可能，但它给了用户更强的激励去获得奖励**，因为货币利益可以立即在二级市场上兑现，流动性使代币化奖励比局限在单个产品的忠诚度积分更有吸引力。\n\n从经济角度看，额外的激励措施会使需求曲线向上移动，其幅度与折扣额相等，这表现为用户增长和现有用户的使用量增加。由此产生的均衡价格、数量和生产者剩余都比基本情况下要高。\n\n567a5ab02aadca67ce0d7d789776bc3.png\n\n### 2.为增长的营销支出提供资金，而不影响当前的现金流\n\n2000 年，PayPal 向新用户奖励了数千万美元的注册奖金，以引导其使用。 这是一个很好的激励措施，但却是从公司金库中取出的真实现金。\n\n除非你是一家拥有大型 VC 支持的初创公司，否则其他新公司很难实现这样的增长营销噱头。\n\n但如**果注册奖励是代币形式，则不会影响公司当前的现金状况**。 相反，当用户在未来使用代币兑换公司的产品和服务时，就能收回当时发放的代币。\n\n借助二级市场的流动性，你可以用未来（未实现）的收入来资助今天的增长。这对更多的公司来说，是一种更灵活的营销支出方案。\n\n此外，您可以调整兑换比例，即 X 数量的代币可以兑换 Y 数量的产品，以根据您的产品和二级市场的价格在不同的时间更改您以美元计价的折扣。\n\n## 这种“货币政策”是您可以使用的额外营销杠杆（它还有助于为您的代币设定地板并支持价格稳定）。与传统的奖励计划相比，代币的另一个好处 ——它增加了直接与间接利益相关者的数量。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IPg0hbuKANYRyn4MA7kto.jpg?height=1600&width=2560)\n\n### 3. 扩大利益相关者基础\n\n许多所谓的 Web 3“社区”只不过是投机者希望代币价格上涨的诉求室，建立在这之上的社区在牛市中是强大的，但从长远来看也是脆弱的，甚至是具有破坏性的，更不用说如果持有代币的目标仅仅是价格上涨，你可能还会遇到监管的麻烦。\n\n相反，一个好的货币应该以相对稳定的价格为目的来使用户对代币产生长期信任。 所以应该激励用户赚取更多的代币，而不是让他们坐等代币升值。\n\n即使没有投机的崇拜者，你的代币在二级市场上流通的事实意味着，它能互动的人比你的实际用户数量更多，而且一个具有稳定价值的资产可以被纳入其他金融工具，进一步扩大你的影响力。\n\n那么有哪些类型的公司适合拥有这种代币？几个基本标准：\n\n#### A.你的产品与市场的契合度很低\n\n**为未经市场检验的产品在第一天就发行代币是不明智的**。代币价格的反射性和投机主义的 \"用户 \"会误导你的产品。当潮水退去时（会的），你会发现自己在裸泳。\n\n如果短期内出现用户流失率很高的状况，拥有代币也并不能解决这个问题。 **确保产品具有足够的粘性，维护你所吸引的用户**。\n\n### B. 边际成本\n\n请记住，**代币奖励的发放是以您未来的收入为代价的**。 如果你的边际成本随着用户数量的增加而下降，那就没什么问题。\n\n在这种情况下，获取更多用户是有意义的，因为它可以抵消您的奖励成本，而代币化将帮助您实现目标。 但是，如果你的边际成本持平或者增加，那代币化可能就没什么意义。\n\n### ", "timestamp": 1656843485, "digest": "5PiSi7CxON2Y2WoK38OiyqvzDjZcZ_ASpBgvxKc0wiI", "contributor": "0xB79c8b10df4C63657669ea6c2c74a4DaB245a6Ba"}

PlaNFT excellently blends Web2.0 social tools with Web3.0 infrastructure, the true feeling of the block meta-universe constructed with Proof of NFT as the verification technique.\n\nIn terms of vision, PlaNFT is also a platform that helps users create a permission-less De-Social protocol. PlaNFT aspires to be the NFT-based social infrastructure solution. PlaNFT’s goal is to transition the next BILLION people from Web2.0 to Web3.0.\n\nFunctionally speaking, PlaNFT has developed a broad technological framework for transferring Web2.0 users to the Web3.0 Metaverse. PlaNFT is a more user-friendly NFT exchange that supports multichain trading. PlaNFT could also provide Foundation Services to assist conventional businesses in solving problems.\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J802b2trPzV2h8BBi12OS.png?height=383&width=680)\n\nThe reason there is never a definitive statement is that for a decentralized platform, anyone has the right to interpret its meaning and anyone is entitled to use the platform in their way.\n\nThe statement that has received the most votes and has received the highest level of acceptance from us so far is that PlaNFT is a general technical framework built to transfer Web2.0 users to Web3.0 Metaverse.\n\nFinally, it’s crucial to remember why we began the process of constructing PlaNFT in the first place. There are many NFT markets with low entry barriers — why do this in the first place?’ For us, it all boils down to one central goal: ensuring that the benefits of digital property ownership are distributed to the rightful owner — you.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7ZHBb3xeuSXzNPj55X2UM.png?height=590&width=1224)\n\nIn our opinion, more complicated challenges for NFTs have already arrived, yet most first-generation NFT firms — mostly marketplaces — are merely concerned with safeguarding themselves, rather than their communities. Our goal is different. We are committed to assuring the safety and freedom of your NFT transactions.\n\nIf you want to buy NFTs today, for example, you must first read and agree the marketplace’s terms of service. However, a close examination of those contracts reveals that they provide no protection to the author, buyer, or seller. They do not protect you. They were written only for the purpose of protecting the platform and its investors.\n\nThat may sound like it’s just a few words moved around, but what it means is that NFT creators cannot create, link, or enforce their terms (whether those are permissive or restrictive) to an NFT. At the same time, buyers and sellers cannot protect themselves if something goes sideways with their transaction (i.e., buy, sell, swap, rent, lend, lease license, etc.).This certainly runs counter to the idea of decentralization.\n\nThis is ‘why PlaNFT,’ and how we want to ensure that everyone benefits in a web3 future while also breaking the stranglehold of rent-seeking web2 platforms where you have no rights and are the product.

Giurgea coined the term “nootropic” in 1972\n\nIt is derived from the Ancient Greek words νόος, meaning “mind”, and τροπή, meaning “a turning”. \n\nGiurgea synthesized [piracetam](https://twitter.com/hashtag/piracetam?src=hashtag_click) in the 1950ies, one of the first putative nootropics:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xItJKPltEFihhYyyrwr6x.jpg?height=817&width=913)\n\nWhile piracetam's potential for cognitive enhancement seems *very limited*, it's only one of hundreds of substances vendors sell on the internet. Many of these novel substances have only been tested on rats.\n\nSome of them are as obscure as they come and **without \\*any\\* safety data**.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohuPpCrnV5bVl53b2/giphy.gif)\n\n### This is where #biohackers come into play.\n\nThey experiment with untested combinations (so-called [#stacks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stacks?src=hashtag_click)) of up to \\~20 substances and post their real-life experiences as “anecdotal evidence” on [@reddit](https://twitter.com/Reddit) boards like /r/Nootropics or /r/Biohackers/. Don't try that at home, kids!\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1ZB9jERWCKcCUAZe8u/giphy.gif)\n\nSome vendors circumvent national regulations by hosting their webshops on offshore-servers or declaring their products as [#researchchemicals](https://twitter.com/hashtag/researchchemicals?src=hashtag_click) for legitimate medical facilities—without actually checking who's buying. \n\nWhen someone gets hurt, there's no accountability whatsoever.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3id8LmtxEqpghrQy2o/giphy.gif)\n\nThe global [#nootropics](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nootropics?src=hashtag_click) market size is projected to reach $5-25 billion in a few years. It's a money printing machine with high margins. I spent some time online chatting with different vendors to gain their trust. Most of them openly admitted to not having any quality checks.\n\nMost stuff is ordered in bulk from [#labs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/labs?src=hashtag_click) in China. A vendor I talked to claimed he could buy fake “Certificates of Authenticity” ([#CoA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoA?src=hashtag_click)) for a little extra – attesting a chemical purity of over 99%. You shouldn't put your health in the hands of some shady backyard lab in China.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/SnwifA7bOFDhe/giphy.gif)\n\nVendors and niche blogs (using affiliate links) seem to control the narrative when it comes to claimed benefits of nootropics. You'll find heaps of “broscience” on how [#modafinil](https://twitter.com/hashtag/modafinil?src=hashtag_click) will help you pass your next exam with flying colors, but a lot less on side effects. [#redflag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/redflag?src=hashtag_click)\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/9McnpKk3degVAkK9BY/giphy.gif)\n\n### It turns out, when it comes to drugs, there's no free lunch\n\nLike many medications, nootropics can cause *downregulation* of a variety of receptors, leading to tolerance development, diminishing returns and ultimately dependence. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n### Sources and further reading: \n\n[https://lexico.com/en/definition/nootropic](https://lexico.com/en/definition/nootropic)\n\n[https://books.google.de/books?id=upjSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false](https://books.google.de/books?id=upjSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n\n[https://webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/features/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview](https://webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/features/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview)\n\n[https://psychologytoday.com/us/blog/engineering-cognitive-experience/201911/the-risks-nootropic-use](https://psychologytoday.com/us/blog/engineering-cognitive-experience/201911/the-risks-nootropic-use)\n\n[https://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(01)06890-8/fulltext](https://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(01)06890-8/fulltext)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-nootropics-market-distribution-channel-160900058.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-nootropics-market-distribution-channel-160900058.html)\n\n[https://bbc.com/news/magazine-35091574 ](https://bbc.com/news/magazine-35091574 )\n\n[https://addcounsel.com/the-dangers-of-smart-drugs/](https://addcounsel.com/the-dangers-of-smart-drugs/)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756795/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756795/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1656842042, "digest": "xAjOMr6GU8oRk12uXnRGL5xT9A6sJkLNf19gkR07EsU", "contributor": "0x81eB8AbBFCADFE9C34b3c24824EBF3D69B9504de"}

Giurgea coined the term “nootropic” in 1972\n\nIt is derived from the Ancient Greek words νόος, meaning “mind”, and τροπή, meaning “a turning”. \n\nGiurgea synthesized [piracetam](https://twitter.com/hashtag/piracetam?src=hashtag_click) in the 1950ies, one of the first putative nootropics:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xItJKPltEFihhYyyrwr6x.jpg?height=817&width=913)\n\nWhile piracetam's potential for cognitive enhancement seems *very limited*, it's only one of hundreds of substances vendors sell on the internet. Many of these novel substances have only been tested on rats.\n\nSome of them are as obscure as they come and **without \\*any\\* safety data**.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohuPpCrnV5bVl53b2/giphy.gif)\n\n### This is where #biohackers come into play.\n\nThey experiment with untested combinations (so-called [#stacks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stacks?src=hashtag_click)) of up to \\~20 substances and post their real-life experiences as “anecdotal evidence” on [@reddit](https://twitter.com/Reddit) boards like /r/Nootropics or /r/Biohackers/. Don't try that at home, kids!\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1ZB9jERWCKcCUAZe8u/giphy.gif)\n\nSome vendors circumvent national regulations by hosting their webshops on offshore-servers or declaring their products as [#researchchemicals](https://twitter.com/hashtag/researchchemicals?src=hashtag_click) for legitimate medical facilities—without actually checking who's buying. \n\nWhen someone gets hurt, there's no accountability whatsoever.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3id8LmtxEqpghrQy2o/giphy.gif)\n\nThe global [#nootropics](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nootropics?src=hashtag_click) market size is projected to reach $5-25 billion in a few years. It's a money printing machine with high margins. I spent some time online chatting with different vendors to gain their trust. Most of them openly admitted to not having any quality checks.\n\nMost stuff is ordered in bulk from [#labs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/labs?src=hashtag_click) in China. A vendor I talked to claimed he could buy fake “Certificates of Authenticity” ([#CoA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoA?src=hashtag_click)) for a little extra – attesting a chemical purity of over 99%. You shouldn't put your health in the hands of some shady backyard lab in China.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/SnwifA7bOFDhe/giphy.gif)\n\nVendors and niche blogs (using affiliate links) seem to control the narrative when it comes to claimed benefits of nootropics.

They believe that the Internet has long been full of holes and the 4 attributes mentioned above are just stages that the Internet will inevitably go through in its development, but they are not enough to constitute web 3.0.", "timestamp": 1656843158, "digest": "1L83mCedg8HL1pSI2rMEYpgial15Gm0vzyisWacvnwo", "contributor": "0x7593525423b6d31e3DF66050939Da799A8839dA4"}

Giurgea coined the term “nootropic” in 1972\n\nIt is derived from the Ancient Greek words νόος, meaning “mind”, and τροπή, meaning “a turning”. \n\nGiurgea synthesized [piracetam](https://twitter.com/hashtag/piracetam?src=hashtag_click) in the 1950ies, one of the first putative nootropics:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xItJKPltEFihhYyyrwr6x.jpg?height=817&width=913)\n\nWhile piracetam's potential for cognitive enhancement seems *very limited*, it's only one of hundreds of substances vendors sell on the internet. Many of these novel substances have only been tested on rats.\n\nSome of them are as obscure as they come and **without \\*any\\* safety data**.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohuPpCrnV5bVl53b2/giphy.gif)\n\n### This is where #biohackers come into play.\n\nThey experiment with untested combinations (so-called [#stacks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stacks?src=hashtag_click)) of up to \\~20 substances and post their real-life experiences as “anecdotal evidence” on [@reddit](https://twitter.com/Reddit) boards like /r/Nootropics or /r/Biohackers/. Don't try that at home, kids!\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1ZB9jERWCKcCUAZe8u/giphy.gif)\n\nSome vendors circumvent national regulations by hosting their webshops on offshore-servers or declaring their products as [#researchchemicals](https://twitter.com/hashtag/researchchemicals?src=hashtag_click) for legitimate medical facilities—without actually checking who's buying. \n\nWhen someone gets hurt, there's no accountability whatsoever.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3id8LmtxEqpghrQy2o/giphy.gif)\n\nThe global [#nootropics](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nootropics?src=hashtag_click) market size is projected to reach $5-25 billion in a few years. It's a money printing machine with high margins. I spent some time online chatting with different vendors to gain their trust. Most of them openly admitted to not having any quality checks.\n\nMost stuff is ordered in bulk from [#labs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/labs?src=hashtag_click) in China. A vendor I talked to claimed he could buy fake “Certificates of Authenticity” ([#CoA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoA?src=hashtag_click)) for a little extra – attesting a chemical purity of over 99%. You shouldn't put your health in the hands of some shady backyard lab in China.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/SnwifA7bOFDhe/giphy.gif)\n\nVendors and niche blogs (using affiliate links) seem to control the narrative when it comes to claimed benefits of nootropics. You'll find heaps of “broscience” on how [#modafinil](https://twitter.com/hashtag/modafinil?src=hashtag_click) will help you pass your next exam with flying colors, but a lot less on side effects. [#redflag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/redflag?src=hashtag_click)\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/9McnpKk3degVAkK9BY/giphy.gif)\n\n### It turns out, when it comes to drugs, there's no free lunch\n\nLike many medications, nootropics can cause *downregulation* of a variety of receptors, leading to tolerance development, diminishing returns and ultimately dependence. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n### Sources and further reading: \n\n[https://lexico.com/en/definition/nootropic](https://lexico.com/en/definition/nootropic)\n\n[https://books.google.de/books?id=upjSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false](https://books.google.de/books?id=upjSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n\n[https://webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/features/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview](https://webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/features/nootropics-smart-drugs-overview)\n\n[https://psychologytoday.com/us/blog/engineering-cognitive-experience/201911/the-risks-nootropic-use](https://psychologytoday.com/us/blog/engineering-cognitive-experience/201911/the-risks-nootropic-use)\n\n[https://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(01)06890-8/fulltext](https://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(01)06890-8/fulltext)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-nootropics-market-distribution-channel-160900058.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-nootropics-market-distribution-channel-160900058.html)\n\n[https://bbc.com/news/magazine-35091574 ](https://bbc.com/news/magazine-35091574 )\n\n[https://addcounsel.com/the-dangers-of-smart-drugs/](https://addcounsel.com/the-dangers-of-smart-drugs/)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756795/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756795/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1656842042, "digest": "xAjOMr6GU8oRk12uXnRGL5xT9A6sJkLNf19gkR07EsU", "contributor": "0x81eB8AbBFCADFE9C34b3c24824EBF3D69B9504de"}

Optimism用户：这个很容易满足，因为mirror用optimism，只要你在mirror上写过文章或者铸造NFT就算满足条件，而且gas费为0。\n2. 重复Optimism用户：在optimism的应用上，每周至少执行一次交易，至少四周以上。如果是mirror的重度用户就可以满足，每周发表一篇文章或者铸造一个NFT就可以啦。\n3. DAO投票者：可以在链上发起或者参与投票至少一次，例如，\\*Governor Alpha and Bravo, Aave, Curve, Maker, Aragon, DAOHaus, DAOStack, and forks。\\*在Snapshot上至少发起或投票两次。注意：会过滤掉活跃的投票者，如果你发起过至少5次提案并且投票，会被过滤掉哦。\n\n   <https://snapshot.org/#/>\n4. 多重签名者：多重签名钱包通过由多个设备，例如，硬件钱包，metamask钱包，或者多个设备组合确认交易的执行，从而提高加密资产的安全性。多重签名钱包的签名者，至少执行十次交易才能满足空投要求，设置多重签名钱包和执行交易都需要支付gas费，在ETH上的gas费大概要几十到上百美金。多重签名钱包包括：*Gnosis Safe v0.1.0-1.3.0, MultiSigWithDailyLimit, MultiSigWalletWithTimeLock。*\n\n   <https://gnosis-safe.io/>\n5. Gitcoin捐赠者：在Gitcoin的layer1上，做出过链上捐赠。\n\n   <https://gitcoin.co/>\n6. ETH链价值输出用户：把资产从ETH通过Bridge技术转移到其他公链或者Layer2，并且在跨链之后每周执行两次交易，公链包括\\*BSC, Fantom, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon; Layer2包括Arbtirum, Optimism, Metis, Boba。\\*桥接之后每个月仍然在ETH上执行至少一次交易。注意：从ETH桥接到其他公链或L2的费用都比较高，如果不需要做跨链转移资产的话，不必为了领空投去操作。从ETH转移资产到optimism，是符合空投要求的，但是转移资产后要在optimism上每周执行至少两次交易，同时每个月还要在ETH上执行至少一次交易。\n\n   <https://app.optimism.io/bridge>\n\n#### 额外奖金：满足四项条件以上就会得到额外空投奖励。\n\n个人建议：\n\n满足前三项条件还是很容易的，不需要gas费，一定要试试。\n\n第5项Gitcoin捐赠项目，最少只要几美金，而且满足这项条件之后，还可以获得额外空投奖励。建议尝试。\n\n第4和6项条件需要的gas费比较高，如果不是真的有需要，不必为了领空投去尝试。", "timestamp": 1656904204, "digest": "VdNT2yb7sXbbl-e-WmUxUatdxPmCbxU4LLw9Rseaecg", "contributor": "0xd00e2c85021d016e52849C167232e4De7e2d5DEC"}

{"id": "NwCoxGMaiXHt0yfj_iBuvZhh36fzIFg-5y6SB8KxMtU", "title": "PlaNFT: Functional Introduction & Prospect", "body": "Through the previous article, you have understood what PlaNFT is, so let’s talk about the functions of PlaNFT and the vision of the future.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FWlZgkpMGVf2GttmRKo0S.png?height=623&width=1106)\n\nFirst of all, let’s start with the trading function of NFT, as a trading platform for NFT, PlaNFT supports cross-chain and multi-currency transactions, the trading market is very simple and clear, in the trading method, PlaNFT provides British and Dutch auctions, you can batch one-click to shelve NFT works, one-click to buy multiple NFT, only charge once Gas fee, which is very convenient and efficient to use.\n\nPlaNFT supports not only image format NFT collections, audio and video NFT can also be uploaded and sold, and there is a unique hundreds of costume change mode for users to create virtual images in the PlaNFT metaverse.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l7GGrWeBpFUpdHe_2h-YU.png?height=532&width=1105)\n\nIn the PlaNFT metaverse, many users are bound to have especially memorable moments, such as successfully bidding on a desired NFT, reaching 1,000 followers in a club, or reaching 100,000-worth of NFT turnover in their Mint.\n\nPlaNFT provides this feature for users, who can hash-cast their memorable moments as NFTs and leave their footprints on the blockchain.\n\nPlaNFT platform supports users to comment on NFT, buyers can see the comments below the NFT to decide whether to buy, and sellers can promote NFT in the comments section, which is the social attributes of PlaNFT exclusive, in the current market, very few NFT trading platforms can do that.\n\nWhy PlaNFT is different from other NFT trading platforms is because, at PlaNFT, NFT is not only JPG pictures, it also has social functions, KOL launched time rentals through NFT, and fans can subscribe to that NFT, enter the club, can interact with KOL, get acquainted with KOL exclusive news, and enjoy the society’s services; KOL then realizes fans’ economic realizations, improves fans’ adherence, creates a high Net Worth Club, and therefore helpful in screening whitelist and airdrop users.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FvGEX4PyRS9tRCCkGjmjN.png?height=534&width=1107)\n\nAfter knowing the features we already have so far, we would like to introduce you, to the features that will be coming soon to PlaNFT.\n\n## Function 1: SWAP\n\nThere are few NFT trading platforms on the market with a Swap function, and in response to this, PlaNFT created the unique SWAP system and intends to officially launch it in the next version update. At present, player A wants to buy BAYC, there is a moonwords and 100U in the pocket, if there is no Swap function, he needs to sell the moonwords first, and then go to buy BAYC, the middle transaction was two times, and needs to spend twice gas fee, with the SWAP function, agreed by the other party, he can directly exchange BAYC with a moonwords + 100U, which means you can exchange BAYC directly, less a transaction process, not only save the gas fee, the transaction time is also shortened, making NFT transactions more efficient.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AxC6VBWjr4qD_FpQmpTcr.png?height=533&width=1107)\n\n## Function 2: Polymerization trading\n\nPlaNFT is committed to creating an all-platform NFT polymerization transaction, is promoting cooperation with various NFT trading platforms, in the future, users can retrieve NFT through PLANFT to all platforms, a key to participate in any platform NFT transactions, both worry-free and efficient, security issues can also be guaranteed.\n\n## Function 3: Wallet2.0 Keyless Wallet\n\nFor metaverse newbies, the barrier of using a traditional decentralized wallet is high, which requires users to download the wallet plug-in and keep the private key properly, once the private key is lost, all their properties will go down the drain. As a plugin for a webpage or APP, the wallet needs to switch back and forth in the process of using, which causes great inconvenience. Therefore, PlaNFT has launched a non-key(Keyless) wallet, which only needs to bind Google or Facebook account to automatically obtain a permanent wallet address, and can be used cross-platform, every usage only requires Google authorization, without multi-page skipping.\n\nTime-saving, effort-saving, and high efficiency are the concepts that PlaNFT advocates at all times, which should also be the future of metaverse. We sincerely hope that every user enjoys a wonderful experience when using PlaNFT, for which we have prepared a guidebook for using the PlaNFT platform for you, and you may also join the group chat of our platforms and talk to the admin for help personally. We always give feedback whenever receiving your questions. And again, have fun exploring the PlaNFT metaverse.", "timestamp": 1656916156, "digest": "CuhWxv93vgEqKO1NMg1OtgTMo2nj7s7oBWuZgCE9oME", "contributor": "0xb3A71116da831c44101d274b7B905F6c52CF1944"}

Cryptocurrencies, like metal money and paper money, are fungible and can be exchanged as general equivalents. Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are a type of non-fungible token that are inherently different.\n\nNFTs are less monetary-like than normalized tokens because of their unique nature, and they are rarely utilized as cash in the metaverse, instead of serving as a unique identifier of identity and things.\n\nThe metaverse’s economic system is provided by fungible cryptocurrencies, while NFTs supply the metaverse with independent identity and ownership of virtual things. Although they are both based on the blockchain, they are fundamentally different. People appear to have grown accustomed to purchasing NFT using bitcoin, although there are undoubtedly some drawbacks to doing so. If you wish to buy an NFT, you must exchange the type of cryptocurrency needed by the associated seller and then opt to buy it afterward, similar to going to a specific country and needing to exchange the corresponding currency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RLi7vowQtaihI7HGb2UhC.png?height=318&width=785)\n\nNFT Swap is a new transaction method of PlaNFT Marketplace that allows users to exchange NFT transactions directly, saving Gas fees while increasing the efficiency and liquidity of NFT transactions. It presently supports the following four situations.\n\n1. A NFT for B NFT\n2. A NFT+ multiple ERC20 tokens for B NFT\n3. A NFT+B NFT for C NFT\n4. A NFT+ multiple ERC20 tokens to B NFT+ multiple ERC20 tokens\n\nHarvey can exchange with James for 100ETH + his Moonbirds NFT if James has a BAYC NFT worth 130ETH to sell and Harvey has a Moonbirds worth 30ETH and wants to buy James’ BAYC. If James agrees to swap, the transaction can be completed using the Swap function on the PlaNFT platform.\n\nJames can also add Harvey as a friend through the Telegram account he left on the PlaNFT platform for private communication. Eventually, the transaction can be carried out at a price acceptable to both parties, and if they make a deal successful, both sides of the transaction can exchange directly. The entire transaction process eliminates intermediate transaction linkages, requiring only one payment of the Gas Fee, which not only lowers transaction costs but also minimizes transaction time, making it incredibly convenient and quick.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xfle4RKP7o8rz3xXKBv2c.png?height=497&width=1108)\n\nThat’s the new experience of Swap Social + NFT, which integrates NFT trading and social networking, improving NFT liquidity and trading efficiency while building a communication bridge between the two sides of the transaction and successfully expanding the players’ social network.\n\nWe are currently opening the shopping cart function as an NFT trading platform; users can add NFT to the alternative list via the shopping cart to facilitate future searches and purchases.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PcUj2Lcaq5NlQRt_wFL1r.png?height=480&width=854)\n\nWhether you are a Gamefi player or an NFT artist looking to sell your NFT for cryptocurrency to join another Gamefi project or want to swap your work with other NFT artists to enrich your inventory, you can advertise your NFT and corresponding needs on PlaNFT’s SWAP page.\n\nCurrently, PlaNFT has a number of NFTs for trade on its SWAP page and PlaNFT is in talks with several Gamefi projects about collaborating. plaNFT is constantly evolving and we sincerely hope you can join us to help create the PlaNFT metaverse.", "timestamp": 1656916865, "digest": "GWz-e-7IkFrCe_Sxdr07w9RAWGJtGhNXRt3ACZRBx0k", "contributor": "0xb3A71116da831c44101d274b7B905F6c52CF1944"}

{"id": "UsTC6Qb6zlf8mf8P8J2Pz2QNPX88oS8Vn2kktdFUvV4", "title": "PlaNFT: Functional Introduction & Prospect", "body": "Through the previous article, you have understood what PlaNFT is, so let’s talk about the functions of PlaNFT and the vision of the future.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FWlZgkpMGVf2GttmRKo0S.png?height=623&width=1106)\n\nFirst of all, let’s start with the trading function of NFT, as a trading platform for NFT, PlaNFT supports cross-chain and multi-currency transactions, the trading market is very simple and clear, in the trading method, PlaNFT provides British and Dutch auctions, you can batch one-click to shelve NFT works, one-click to buy multiple NFT, only charge once Gas fee, which is very convenient and efficient to use.\n\nPlaNFT supports not only image format NFT collections, audio and video NFT can also be uploaded and sold, and there is a unique hundreds of costume change mode for users to create virtual images in the PlaNFT metaverse.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l7GGrWeBpFUpdHe_2h-YU.png?height=532&width=1105)\n\nIn the PlaNFT metaverse, many users are bound to have especially memorable moments, such as successfully bidding on a desired NFT, reaching 1,000 followers in a club, or reaching 100,000-worth of NFT turnover in their Mint.\n\nPlaNFT provides this feature for users, who can hash-cast their memorable moments as NFTs and leave their footprints on the blockchain.\n\nPlaNFT platform supports users to comment on NFT, buyers can see the comments below the NFT to decide whether to buy, and sellers can promote NFT in the comments section, which is the social attributes of PlaNFT exclusive, in the current market, very few NFT trading platforms can do that.\n\nWhy PlaNFT is different from other NFT trading platforms is because, at PlaNFT, NFT is not only JPG pictures, it also has social functions, KOL launched time rentals through NFT, and fans can subscribe to that NFT, enter the club, can interact with KOL, get acquainted with KOL exclusive news, and enjoy the society’s services; KOL then realizes fans’ economic realizations, improves fans’ adherence, creates a high Net Worth Club, and therefore helpful in screening whitelist and airdrop users.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FvGEX4PyRS9tRCCkGjmjN.png?height=534&width=1107)\n\nAfter knowing the features we already have so far, we would like to introduce you, to the features that will be coming soon to PlaNFT.\n\n## Function 1: SWAP\n\nThere are few NFT trading platforms on the market with a Swap function, and in response to this, PlaNFT created the unique SWAP system and intends to officially launch it in the next version update. At present, player A wants to buy BAYC, there is a moonwords and 100U in the pocket, if there is no Swap function, he needs to sell the moonwords first, and then go to buy BAYC, the middle transaction was two times, and needs to spend twice gas fee, with the SWAP function, agreed by the other party, he can directly exchange BAYC with a moonwords + 100U, which means you can exchange BAYC directly, less a transaction process, not only save the gas fee, the transaction time is also shortened, making NFT transactions more efficient.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AxC6VBWjr4qD_FpQmpTcr.png?height=533&width=1107)\n\n## Function 2: Polymerization trading\n\nPlaNFT is committed to creating an all-platform NFT polymerization transaction, is promoting cooperation with various NFT trading platforms, in the future, users can retrieve NFT through PLANFT to all platforms, a key to participate in any platform NFT transactions, both worry-free and efficient, security issues can also be guaranteed.\n\n## Function 3: Wallet2.0 Keyless Wallet\n\nFor metaverse newbies, the barrier of using a traditional decentralized wallet is high, which requires users to download the wallet plug-in and keep the private key properly, once the private key is lost, all their properties will go down the drain. As a plugin for a webpage or APP, the wallet needs to switch back and forth in the process of using, which causes great inconvenience. Therefore, PlaNFT has launched a non-key(Keyless) wallet, which only needs to bind Google or Facebook account to automatically obtain a permanent wallet address, and can be used cross-platform, every usage only requires Google authorization, without multi-page skipping.\n\nTime-saving, effort-saving, and high efficiency are the concepts that PlaNFT advocates at all times, which should also be the future of metaverse. We sincerely hope that every user enjoys a wonderful experience when using PlaNFT, for which we have prepared a guidebook for using the PlaNFT platform for you, and you may also join the group chat of our platforms and talk to the admin for help personally. We always give feedback whenever receiving your questions. And again, have fun exploring the PlaNFT metaverse.", "timestamp": 1656916156, "digest": "CuhWxv93vgEqKO1NMg1OtgTMo2nj7s7oBWuZgCE9oME", "contributor": "0xb3A71116da831c44101d274b7B905F6c52CF1944"}

{"id": "y50JyWoltG17z0Y9WnAxZmiy_k8FneXEyrY-x2jgsKU", "title": "推动Web3的下一次大爆发", "body": "代币化是 Web 3 的重大突破。它为创新创造了巨大的可能性，但也打开了潘多拉魔盒。\n\n**任何人都可以创建一个代币来代表任何有价值的东西，并在一个开放的网络上根据共同标准来与其他资产进行交易，这是公链出来之前不可想象的事情**。代币化也让许多 Web 3“产品”在短期内获得了吸引力，即使它们本身是不可持续的。\n\n庞氏骗局最终都会崩溃，但这并不能否定这样一个事实——即如果应用在正确的环境中，代币化是一种强大的经济工具，可以促进业务增长。\n\n现实世界中的企业才刚刚意识到代币化的力量， 熊市中投机的消亡为代币化的真正创新提供了喘息的空间。拥有可行产品的公司，如果能够尽早将实用代币纳入现有商业模式，将获得丰厚的回报，同时推动加密货币的采用。\n\n我所说的\\*\\*“实用代币”是指在产品生命周期中有明确用途的代币，而不是让持有者分享公司利润的“股权代币”\\*\\*，后者类似于股票，并且在未来可能会遇到监管方面的障碍。那么传统企业如何从实用代币中受益？ 这里有3种方法：\n\n### 1.用户黏性/用户忠诚度\n\n最简单的实用代币使用案例是作为一个奖励计划——用户越是使用产品，就能获得更多的代币，然后代币可以在未来兑换更多的产品。\n\n忠诚度并不是什么新鲜事——想想飞行常客的里程数记录、星巴克奖励、信用卡积分等， 改变游戏规则的部分是：**允许一个人赚取的“积分”在公共区块链上的二级市场具有流动性**。\n\n这彻底颠覆了传统忠诚度的商业模式。\n\n**传统的用户奖励本质上是歧视性定价**。按使用水平向用户收取不同的价格，可以让公司获得更高的利润——或者用经济术语来说，就是更高的生产者剩余。\n\n这就是航空公司不允许您出售飞行常客里程的原因，如果“批量折扣”可以转让给其他用户，这种商业模式就会崩溃。\n\n但是，如果你把忠诚度代币化，就会发生这样的事情，如果忠诚度积分是可替换的代币，可以在二级市场上进行交易，那么你给每个人的折扣都是一样的，即=代币价格×1个代币可以兑换的产品数量。\n\n那么，为什么企业都想要将忠诚度代币化呢？\n\n因为**尽管代币使得差异化定价成为可能，但它给了用户更强的激励去获得奖励**，因为货币利益可以立即在二级市场上兑现，流动性使代币化奖励比局限在单个产品的忠诚度积分更有吸引力。\n\n从经济角度看，额外的激励措施会使需求曲线向上移动，其幅度与折扣额相等，这表现为用户增长和现有用户的使用量增加。由此产生的均衡价格、数量和生产者剩余都比基本情况下要高。\n\n567a5ab02aadca67ce0d7d789776bc3.png\n\n### 2.为增长的营销支出提供资金，而不影响当前的现金流\n\n2000 年，PayPal 向新用户奖励了数千万美元的注册奖金，以引导其使用。 这是一个很好的激励措施，但却是从公司金库中取出的真实现金。\n\n除非你是一家拥有大型 VC 支持的初创公司，否则其他新公司很难实现这样的增长营销噱头。\n\n但如**果注册奖励是代币形式，则不会影响公司当前的现金状况**。 相反，当用户在未来使用代币兑换公司的产品和服务时，就能收回当时发放的代币。\n\n借助二级市场的流动性，你可以用未来（未实现）的收入来资助今天的增长。这对更多的公司来说，是一种更灵活的营销支出方案。\n\n此外，您可以调整兑换比例，即 X 数量的代币可以兑换 Y 数量的产品，以根据您的产品和二级市场的价格在不同的时间更改您以美元计价的折扣。\n\n## 这种“货币政策”是您可以使用的额外营销杠杆（它还有助于为您的代币设定地板并支持价格稳定）。与传统的奖励计划相比，代币的另一个好处 ——它增加了直接与间接利益相关者的数量。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IPg0hbuKANYRyn4MA7kto.jpg?height=1600&width=2560)\n\n### 3. 扩大利益相关者基础\n\n许多所谓的 Web 3“社区”只不过是投机者希望代币价格上涨的诉求室，建立在这之上的社区在牛市中是强大的，但从长远来看也是脆弱的，甚至是具有破坏性的，更不用说如果持有代币的目标仅仅是价格上涨，你可能还会遇到监管的麻烦。\n\n相反，一个好的货币应该以相对稳定的价格为目的来使用户对代币产生长期信任。 所以应该激励用户赚取更多的代币，而不是让他们坐等代币升值。\n\n即使没有投机的崇拜者，你的代币在二级市场上流通的事实意味着，它能互动的人比你的实际用户数量更多，而且一个具有稳定价值的资产可以被纳入其他金融工具，进一步扩大你的影响力。\n\n那么有哪些类型的公司适合拥有这种代币？几个基本标准：\n\n#### A.你的产品与市场的契合度很低\n\n**为未经市场检验的产品在第一天就发行代币是不明智的**。代币价格的反射性和投机主义的 \"用户 \"会误导你的产品。当潮水退去时（会的），你会发现自己在裸泳。\n\n如果短期内出现用户流失率很高的状况，拥有代币也并不能解决这个问题。 **确保产品具有足够的粘性，维护你所吸引的用户**。\n\n### B. 边际成本\n\n请记住，**代币奖励的发放是以您未来的收入为代价的**。 如果你的边际成本随着用户数量的增加而下降，那就没什么问题。\n\n在这种情况下，获取更多用户是有意义的，因为它可以抵消您的奖励成本，而代币化将帮助您实现目标。 但是，如果你的边际成本持平或者增加，那代币化可能就没什么意义。\n\n### ", "timestamp": 1656843485, "digest": "5PiSi7CxON2Y2WoK38OiyqvzDjZcZ_ASpBgvxKc0wiI", "contributor": "0xB79c8b10df4C63657669ea6c2c74a4DaB245a6Ba"}

PlaNFT excellently blends Web2.0 social tools with Web3.0 infrastructure, the true feeling of the block meta-universe constructed with Proof of NFT as the verification technique.\n\nIn terms of vision, PlaNFT is also a platform that helps users create a permission-less De-Social protocol. PlaNFT aspires to be the NFT-based social infrastructure solution. PlaNFT’s goal is to transition the next BILLION people from Web2.0 to Web3.0.\n\nFunctionally speaking, PlaNFT has developed a broad technological framework for transferring Web2.0 users to the Web3.0 Metaverse. PlaNFT is a more user-friendly NFT exchange that supports multichain trading. PlaNFT could also provide Foundation Services to assist conventional businesses in solving problems.\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J802b2trPzV2h8BBi12OS.png?height=383&width=680)\n\nThe reason there is never a definitive statement is that for a decentralized platform, anyone has the right to interpret its meaning and anyone is entitled to use the platform in their way.\n\nThe statement that has received the most votes and has received the highest level of acceptance from us so far is that PlaNFT is a general technical framework built to transfer Web2.0 users to Web3.0 Metaverse.\n\nFinally, it’s crucial to remember why we began the process of constructing PlaNFT in the first place. There are many NFT markets with low entry barriers — why do this in the first place?’ For us, it all boils down to one central goal: ensuring that the benefits of digital property ownership are distributed to the rightful owner — you.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7ZHBb3xeuSXzNPj55X2UM.png?height=590&width=1224)\n\nIn our opinion, more complicated challenges for NFTs have already arrived, yet most first-generation NFT firms — mostly marketplaces — are merely concerned with safeguarding themselves, rather than their communities. Our goal is different. We are committed to assuring the safety and freedom of your NFT transactions.\n\nIf you want to buy NFTs today, for example, you must first read and agree the marketplace’s terms of service. However, a close examination of those contracts reveals that they provide no protection to the author, buyer, or seller. They do not protect you. They were written only for the purpose of protecting the platform and its investors.\n\nThat may sound like it’s just a few words moved around, but what it means is that NFT creators cannot create, link, or enforce their terms (whether those are permissive or restrictive) to an NFT. At the same time, buyers and sellers cannot protect themselves if something goes sideways with their transaction (i.e., buy, sell, swap, rent, lend, lease license, etc.).This certainly runs counter to the idea of decentralization.\n\nThis is ‘why PlaNFT,’ and how we want to ensure that everyone benefits in a web3 future while also breaking the stranglehold of rent-seeking web2 platforms where you have no rights and are the product.

Don't try that at home, kids!\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1ZB9jERWCKcCUAZe8u/giphy.gif)\n\nSome vendors circumvent national regulations by hosting their webshops on offshore-servers or declaring their products as [#researchchemicals](https://twitter.com/hashtag/researchchemicals?src=hashtag_click) for legitimate medical facilities—without actually checking who's buying. \n\nWhen someone gets hurt, there's no accountability whatsoever.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3id8LmtxEqpghrQy2o/giphy.gif)\n\nThe global [#nootropics](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nootropics?src=hashtag_click) market size is projected to reach $5-25 billion in a few years. It's a money printing machine with high margins. I spent some time online chatting with different vendors to gain their trust.

You shouldn't put your health in the hands of some shady backyard lab in China.\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/SnwifA7bOFDhe/giphy.gif)\n\nVendors and niche blogs (using affiliate links) seem to control the narrative when it comes to claimed benefits of nootropics.

Growth models for Web3\n2. Creating a lasting Growth strategy for Web3\n3. Building your Web3 Growth team\n\n2021 was the year of crypto and blockchain companies. We saw a record-high number of deals and funding pouring into the space; VCs around the world invested more than $10.5 billion in Q4 2021, the most of any quarter last year and more than all of 2020 combined. To get started, let’s look at the development of cryptocurrency as it pertains to Web3.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RvaMtkCJWgqbDmtk-nh8H.png?height=738&width=1262)\n\nI wouldn’t expect 2022 to be any slower either, as we’ve already seen investment funds raise significant amounts of capital ready to be deployed into the space. Among the most important announcements of the year were: Paradigm’s $2.5 billion funds, Andreessen Horowitz’s $2.2 billion funds, FTX $2B investment fund, and [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) just recently announced a $500MM fund.\n\nAs investors put big money behind the ecosystem, expectations will be high, and Web3 companies will have to go all-in on growth. Similar to what happened in the Web2 space a decade ago, we should expect to see an influx of companies in the crypto space rushing to hire for Growth roles ([already happening](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2ecdd9b-cff0-40da-9dad-881c9c820c43_1462x736.png)) and scrambling to put together teams that can scale winning growth models.\n\nIt will be exciting to see how it plays out, as I believe that the Web3 enables an entirely different approach to growth at all levels — from acquisition channels and tactics, user journeys, and onboarding experiences, to retention and engagement levers (more on this in future articles). But Web3 also adds a different set of challenges in a space where decentralization, anonymity, protocol ownership, and user-owned data are the new norms.\n\nThe new Web3 growth [frameworks](https://future.a16z.com/go-to-market-in-web3-new-mindsets-tactics-success-metrics/) and [playbooks](https://mirror.xyz/latticefund.eth/PitMKg6D0euBwvhkgPS8TJpN2UU27G8Uu_DmkyvOTGI) are being re-writing as we “speak”.\n\nBut, what are some of the principles and systems that we can bring from Web2 into this new thriving ecosystem?\n\n## Web2 growth in a nutshell\n\nBefore we dive into what growth means for Web3, let’s do a high-level overview of a decade of content around growth frameworks for Web2 companies.\n\n[Andy Johns](https://twitter.com/ibringtraffic) has one of the best quotes that help explain what growth means at its most basic level:\n\n> *If Finance owns the flow of cash in and out of a company. Growth owns the flow of customers in and out of a product.*\n\nAs you’ve probably heard before, growth cannot be defined by a specific set of tactics, silver bullets, or exact roles within your company. This is something that applies to both Web2 and Web3 products.\n\nGrowth is a system that sits between your company mission, values, and business model that help you define:\n\n1. **[How does our product grow?](https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-wins)**\n\n   [Brian Balfour](https://twitter.com/bbalfour) and the [Reforge](https://reforge.com/) team do an excellent work breaking this down into four questions that help us answer the above statement;\n\n   *1. How do we acquire? 2. How do we retain? 3. How do we monetize? 4. How do we defend?*\n\n   Viewing these questions through the context of specific growth loops within your business will help you put together a holistic growth model for your company.\n2. **[The four essential fits](https://www.reforge.com/the-road-to-100m)**\n\n   Is not only about Product-Market Fit, a well-structured growth model needs to find four essential fits: *Market Product Fit, Product Channel Fit, Channel Model Fit, Model Market Fit.*\n3. **[Your Growth strategy](https://brianbalfour.com/growth-machine/authentic-growth)**\n\n   Once we understand how our product grows and fits with our community/market, channels, and business model, we can define a sustainable and scalable go-to-market or growth strategy.\n4. **[Building a Growth team](https://medium.com/swlh/building-a-world-class-growth-team-25cb508e666d)**\n\n   As more and more companies put together their teams to push for uniques go-to-market and growth strategies, winning at growth will require you to not only have the best approach but the best team structure to deploy this strategy as fast as possible.\n\n[Casey Winters](https://twitter.com/onecaseman) (former Growth Lead at Pinterest/Grubhub) separates these areas [in his definition of growth](https://caseyaccidental.com/what-are-growth-teams-for-and-what-do-they-work-on/):\n\n> *The purpose of growth is to scale the usage of a product that has a product-market fit. You do this by building a playbook on how to scale the usage of a product. A playbook can also be called a growth model or a loop.*\n\nHe goes on to add:\n\n> *Most product teams are built to create or improve the core value provided to customers. Growth is connecting more people to the existing value.*\n\nWe could go on for hours trying to narrow down what growth exactly means and how can be applied across types of [products, businesses, and teams](https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-system), and there’s already excellent content out there for you to dig deeper into this topic.\n\nSo, now that we have a base of understanding of what growth as a system is trying to answer for your product, let’s break it down specifically for Web3 companies.\n\n## Growth for Web3 companies\n\n### How does your Web3 product scale?\n\nWe can break this problem statement down to four core questions that we need to answer so we can lay down the foundational pieces of our growth model:\n\n**How do we acquire?**\n\nLattice Capital did a [great breakdown](https://mirror.xyz/latticefund.eth/PitMKg6D0euBwvhkgPS8TJpN2UU27G8Uu_DmkyvOTGI) of the current proven ways Web3 companies can start framing their acquisition strategy — *Partnerships, user ownership, and token-driven growth pools are the pillars of Web3 growth strategies.*\n\n![The Web3 Growth Playbook](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TleAIu22TAIb6F7Q1dHNe.png?height=1486&width=2846)\n\nBut, the tactics outlined above rely on the assumption that their target user is already familiar or onboarded into the Web3 ecosystem, not necessarily focused on how or who will help onboard the next billion users.\n\nThe current acquisition playbook for crypto companies is still very turbulent and full of unknowns, especially given the inherent friction that a newcomer has to go through when getting started in Web3, from joining a Discord, to setting up Metamask, buying an NFT, sourcing open bounties, and so much more. The system is still full of friction and barriers for “normies” to easily join and participate in the space, and we are seeing rapidly increasing competition between companies to go after the current crypto-educated consumer.\n\nWinners in the Web3 space will be the ones that can clearly define:\n\n1. Where in the spectrum of centralization vs. decentralization will this product sit?\n2. Is this a network effect-driven business or not?\n3. What does success look like? (User growth, TLV, developer activity, transaction volume, wallets connected, etc.)\n\n**How do we retain?**\n\nRetention is the foundation of any growth strategy. For Web2 companies, retention is the basis of how Product-Market Fit is measured, and often a positive retention rate helps drive more acquisition and revenue for the company.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I see between Web2 and Web3 growth is user retention and how we think about it. Why? User or customer retention in Web2 is driven by our ability to engage and “resurrect” specific users via email, push, in-app, basically Lifecycle marketing. But in Web3, there’s no concept of “user” as an identifiable individual, and we can’t target them through traditional Lifecycle strategies.\n\nFor example, instead of emails, you can only rely on wallet addresses as a unique “user” identifier. The issue is that an individual user can access your dApp with more than one wallet, which can make your data potentially less accurate.\n\nDefining what [“Identity” means in Web3](https://www.donaldbullers.com/identity-on-web3/) is one of the most challenging and interesting areas for the space in the coming years. User ownership and governance, on-chain activity, community engagement are proving to be some of the underlying mechanics that will shape the future of the loyalty/retention programs for Web3 companies.\n\nMy guess is that this year many of these questions will start getting answered. The rising verticals in the last two years, like NFTs, DeFi and DAOs will have to quickly iterate and innovate on how they address churn and user retention so they can sustain their current “up-and-to-the-right” trajectory as macroeconomics conditions might play against the current bullish sentiment of the crypto markets.\n\n**How do we monetize?**\n\nFor both Web2 and Web3 companies, *“monetization is much more than just price”* as is stated in the [Experimentation + Testing program from Reforge](https://www.reforge.com/experimentation-testing), and they have a great framework to address this.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bQomWLUVliop9-60HMn2Y.png?height=1646&width=2834)\n\nAs we think of all the elements of the monetization strategy, we need to be aware that our decisions around each of these specific elements create more or less friction for someone becoming a paying customer or a user of our product, which relates to both Web2 and Web3 companies.\n\n> *If what we are charging for is really well known to the users and very well understood, that's low friction, but if what we're charging for is pretty new in the market and not well understood, an unknown, that creates high friction — Reforge*\n\nSo far, the big centralized Web3 companies like Opensea or Coinbase have utilized “well known and very well understood” monetization strategies like trading fees or listing/selling fees, which has reduced the friction for new users to join and use their platforms.\n\nBut Web3 offers a much more broad end of possibility for decentralized organization In terms of new revenue streams. For example, it will be interesting to see how “free-to-X” DAOs, Games, Web3 social networks, etc., will be able to monetize their treasury through DeFi strategies and break the common idea *“if you are not paying for the product you are the product.”*\n\n**How do we defend?**\n\nThis chart from [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/863917/number-crypto-coins-tokens/) shows how rapidly new Web3 and crypto companies have emerged in the last few years, and there’s no sign that this trend will slow down any time soon.\n\n![Number of cryptocurrencies worldwide from 2013 to February 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NBC4c4kPE6qR7y4xQca9y.png?height=936&width=1426)\n\nEven though Web3 and Crypto are still very nascent industries, competition is already proving to be fearless. For example, [LooksRare drove $100MM of NFT sales](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/11/one-day-after-launch-opensea-competitor-looksrare-sells-over-100m-in-nfts/#:\\~:text=After%20months%20of%20speculation%20about,thoroughly%20decentralized%20%E2%80%93%20competitor%3A%20LooksRare.) on the day of launch and currently stands as a serious competitor to Opensea.\n\n> *Growth = speed and speed is a competitive advantage in today’s markets — [Matt Bivons](https://medium.com/swlh/building-a-world-class-growth-team-25cb508e666d)*\n\nAs more competition comes into the space, current distribution channels will become less effective. Who is not currently dealing with Discord fatigue or distrusting most Airdrops?\n\nWe are seeing some really interesting things happening with user ownership, network participation, token economics, etc. But defensible walls within the Web3 ecosystems will have a very similar foundation to what we saw drove growth for some of the most successful Web2 companies; network effects, strong communities, and [organic growth loops or flywheels](https://www.field-guide.unusual.vc/field-guide-consumer/growth-flywheel-fundamentals).\n\n## Framing our growth model\n\nIn a nutshell, your growth model is a system or loop that represents the qualitative or quantitative levers that inform your product growth.\n\nAnswering the questions we went through the article will set a path for your company to clearly define and communicate the strategy, goals, metrics, priorities, and team to sustainable and rapidly scale.\n\n> *\"This is one of the most common mistakes among founders when I ask \"How does your product grow?\" The answer is typically a long list of linear tactics. It is typically because there is no hypothesis on what the growth engine is, and as a result, they are compensating by trying to cobble together a lot of little things.\" - Brian Balfour (Founder/CEO at Reforge, Ex-VP Growth at HubSpot)\"*\n\nTraditional Web2 growth frameworks can be a practical guide to get started and offer a proxy of how successful products can grow. Product mission and purpose, incentives alignment, and a thriving community seem to be the current pillars of the Web3 growth models, but there’s still so much to uncover, test and learn as more mainstream users get onboarded in this space.\n\n> At [Safary](https://www.safary.club/), a community of web3 growth experts, we’re defining what growth looks like in web3.\n\nIn the following article, we will break down these current models using the four “fits” framework and define the principles of a sustainable and scalable growth strategy.", "timestamp": 1657131857, "digest": "SxidVP-nzYlafo7ecpssVDT3prFx7xY6vML_IGakESY", "contributor": "0xcF31584B270EB1cD06638fb190b9ec0fD99b7fc6"}

{"id": "WFNUtOvffIKDY0NhwNZbQo_hKWuAJQ_s2ZEkPNdizOw", "title": "一个存档 ", "body": "这一篇非常重要 （修正版）                      \n  \n (2022年3月15日初稿，18日修正） 我最近和一朋友聊天说道，一些人之所以喜欢做短线和做波段，终日惶恐不安，是因为不知道终点，既然我们知道终点，又何惧路途的坎坷，耐心就是最大的法宝。正如2020年我就提出了2021年的终点站，这次我也是从终点谈起。那就是2024年年中（一高）、2026年的6月高点（二高）和2027年1-2月的最高点（三高）（修改说明：本处增设了2024年第一高点）。 \n  \n 布局的时间节点，也就是2022-2023年期间，这是整个市场最低迷的阶段。尽管这里面有很多波段可以做，甚至对于比特币，4月到5月初就是一个机会。7月高点和11月都会有一个小高点。但是2023年依然会是一个惨淡的局面，也正因为如此，2023年是布局山寨币的最佳时机。短线无所谓做不做，我们需要做的是，你逢低屯的山寨，能熬过这几年的周期，迎来百倍的机遇。我们不怕比特币跌还是涨，但是这种跌和涨的反复震荡过程中，会把山寨币价挫到更低。 \n  \n 2022-2023年不仅仅是加密货币的低点，同样是美股的低点。但是在2024年会释放降息预期，适时进入降息周期。2025年前后，遭逢康波萧条期最严重的经济危机，全球资产会迎来一轮恐慌性抛售（本句新增），美联储开启超级放水，这才是造就下一轮牛市的发动机。 \n  \n 在当前经济滞胀的环境下，美国会很难以承受长周期的收缩状态，尤其在2025年后康波萧条期进入最严重的阶段，甚至会导致类似1929-1931年经济危机惨状的时候，美国将不得不采取更加激进的放水措施，从而推动美股和比特币走向巅峰。 \n  \n 在本次俄乌战争中，最大的结果就是推动了世界新秩序的形成，俄罗斯彻底放弃了西方人的姿态，被逼加入了东方阵营。以美国发起，中国反抗性主导的东西方对立的格局逐渐形成。未来的世界是中国的，这不是被洗脑的结果，这是必然的选择，是美国自己的各种骚操作加速了这一进程。加密货币对于未来美国来讲，就像是当前对于土耳其或者俄罗斯，会成为美元衰落后最后的反击力量。我之前一直讲美元的没落，这也是其中原因之一。 \n  \n 2024-2043年，这20年，我们会看到中国崛起的力量，无论是在科技、经济、国防、航天各个方面，都会远胜美国，尽管你现在看不到。因此，尽管当前世人总说经济危机，但是经济危机依然没有到来，就是中美还在忍，还没有出现绝对的力量。之后，不一样。美国也许会通过自残的方式，自伤800也要杀敌1000，主动推动经济危机的发生，这也是割韭菜的一种方式。（本段新增，也是对比特币周期的解释）比特币4.2的中枢区间不会变，甚至4.2以下都是诱空行为，因为他迟早会攀升到更高峰，而且4.2以下最多维持一年时间。 \n  \n 如果3月底-4月跌到2万附近，将是长期屯住比特币的最佳时机。不管后面如何波动，都没有问题。如果3、4月份不到，那就等8月-10月份或者2023年初（本处把8月份改为8-10月）。2024年减半第一高点后下行震荡，直到2026年6月第二高点，然后在2027年1月附近进入最疯狂的出货阶段。（本处增设1个高点） \n  \n 为什么一直坚持到两万，一方面技术上，350dma拐头的时候，通常都会有一波超级瀑布，这在2014-2015以及2017-2018年都是同样的技术性拐点。另一方面，我预计在本月下旬，21日附近，世界有更大的利空发生，只不过现在还不知道到底是什么事情。正如我去年底就预测3月份疫情很严重的事情，都已经成真。这种事背后的逻辑只言片语很难讲清楚。所以关键在下周、本月下旬的时间点，不管如何，这里都是一个很好的机会。 \n  \n 短线方面：比特币如果不能在3-4月砸出低点，也就是疫情+战争+美联储，三大重锤都不能砸破3万的话，应该要往后延期。美联储本月加息25个基点，有些低于预期，市场老怀安慰。但是，缩表才是最具杀伤力的。如果说加息是中药，慢慢治疗，缩表就是西药，一颗见效。美国在乌克兰的一波操作非常成功的让资金回流美国，导致美联储抱有希望，因此在3月份轻轻的下手。但是接下来，会一锤比一锤重，我们读一读《美股70年》，好好的研究下鲍威尔这个人，我去年9月就说他会疯狂的加息，对此我依然深信不疑。以至于会在接下来的数个月份中，流动性急剧缩减，金融资产大幅下跌。也就是，我猜测这个效应也许到8-10月份就会显露出来。但是这就是一个抄底的机会。（本段新增，算是一个对原来预测的一个解释） \n  \n  \n 长线方面：2023年上半年，依然是窒息的上半年。但是下半年，也许用不到下半年，就是开始一路飙升。美国加息任务全面完成。也就是说，在2023年上半年前，你必须梭哈完毕。  \n  \n 第一、保底十倍山寨币。只要不下架，项目运作正常，在公链、defi和nft赛道中，大部分山寨都会十倍，和过去的2016-2017、2020-2021年一个样，所以这个不用多说。只要这种趋势型的大牛市在，就是垃圾都会上天，这个时候不需要基本面，也不需要信仰。这个大家都深有体会，应该能理解。因为我们知道终点，所以倒推逻辑是很容易的事情。我前几天和朋友说，即便你现在的价格买atom、ar，早晚也会10倍，就是你拿不住而已。天天关注市场，而不关注趋势，最终都会一无所获。    \n  \n  \n 第二，一般百倍币。我甚至想说，我在2020年3月份列举的十倍币清单依然有效，比如rune、aave、ren、snx等等，我在2020年10月份说他们依然还会十倍。现在可以说，他们在下一轮牛市中依然会实现百倍空间，前提是团队不跑路、没有被黑客攻击等等意料之外的事情。Defi革命去年只成功一小半，交易所、defi、平台币永远是主题，尤其在俄罗斯被制裁的环境中，去中心化交易所众望所归。牛市来了，交易量增加，平台币没有不涨的理由，这个逻辑非常简单。我公开说过很多次，但是越是公开说，你越不信。不管加密货币如何发展，去中心化交易所平台币，都是永远的牛市先锋。 \n  \n  \n 最近我梳理了很多dex挖矿释放时间，按照四年释放周期，在挖矿结束，进入通缩的节点，这些币经历过惨淡下跌后，必然性的会有百倍以上的涨幅（这也是牛市的基础逻辑之一，只有市场的抛压全部结束，市场出清才会迎来牛市）。平台币关注赋能，比如sushi跌了这么多，2023年挖矿结束，同时代币功能也有，那么就有很大的机会。包括rune，开发了合成资产模式，类似snx、luna。这些币种在大跌之后，市值变得足够低的情况下，是不用担心的，除非团队跑路以及其他意外事件。同时还有各种大型公链上的dex代币。只有市值足够小，下跌足够狠，才能实现百倍涨幅。  \n  \n 1、这里要说明是，币安今年新上的币种以及未来新上的币种里，也有很多优质dex币种，但是因为价格过高，现在没法介入。比如隐私交易torn，等等，很多，需要他们在2023年初跌入谷底。  \n  \n 2、公链里面的去中心化交易所代币，暂时没有上币安的，我也没有关注。因为我个人喜欢接盘，喜欢在安全的环境中交易，主要在于币安拥有炒作资金的流量。  \n  \n 3、对于交易所，未来两年还会有很多变化，建议关注每个交易所的进展情况和日常交易额变化，随时切换。如果我现在指出哪个交易所平台币会百倍，那是不现实的，正如抹茶可以做起来，虎符就做不起来，这个和团队运营能力息息相关。只能说一个方向。 \n  \n  \n  第三，元宇宙。这是个潜力千倍币板块。2025年之后，才是元宇宙爆发的高峰，对于这一点你要坚信不疑。2025年后，由中国引领的ai、vr世界将会响彻全球，《头号玩家》变成现实应用，元宇宙产业链全线迸发。尽管元宇宙全产业链，我前面有篇文章做过专门分析，包括dao、ens域名、去中心化身份、存储等等web3脉络。这些会涨，但是没有经济促动力或者经济动能不是特别大，比如dao，概念可以，但没有足够的经济动能，百倍可以，千倍就会很困难。所以千倍币绝对要聚焦链游本身。而哪些链游会更疯，那一定是土地炒作，只有带有土地、房产的链游才会有炒作的抓手。我之前在文章说，mana、sand未来市值也许会无限大，就在于这种可能性。但是团队如果没有按照我前面提出的思路（把defi囊括到土地建筑物当中）去发展，可能性也许不会有。我不会推荐mana、sand，因为市值已经太高，不是千倍对象。 \n  \n 链游主要判断要素在于两点：  \n 1、沙盒游戏。 2、有土地炒作基因。  \n 比如现在正在一直下跌的alice、tlm，新上线的loka、high，都具备土地、房产炒作的基本抓手。我们需要等他们市值变得足够低的时候入手，只有千万市值附近才能实现千倍空间。我希望在今明两年能够等到那一天。如果等不到也要在2023年下半年之前上车。而且未来两年此类项目还会层出不穷，注意挖掘。我本人不会去挖掘，太费劲，只擅长二级接盘。 尽管我一直说山寨币的空间，但是你肯定会拿不住，因为比特币行情好的时候，山寨币有时候并不跟风。所以比特币一直是主要的操作标的。 \n  \n 如果按照我的操作，我会首先拿住比特币，经历过2022-2023上半年之后，比特币也许就是一条弯弯曲曲的一直往上走的线条。在比特币确立牛市行情后，山寨才是最疯狂的阶段。但是如果有耐心，山寨币收益率绝对是比特币的数十倍空间。 以上是从山寨币的业务方向进行明确，坚持两条核心。 \n  \n 公链方面，币安最近也上线了很多币种，T、kaly、rose等等。至少目前来看，我最看好atom、avax两条公链，无论在技术性能上还是生态上都是经得起推敲的。公链核心还是以太坊，这点暂时还不会变。 尽管我说过一些公链会超越以太坊，但是从sol、ftm这些项目的表现看，一些没格局、没真技术的团队，依然很多，类似v神如此专注的领导人少之又少（本句新增）。  \n  \n 最后需要提醒的是，本文仅仅是根据目前市场对未来四年做出的预测，所以币种方面未来变化会非常多，会有很多的新项目、新热点。但是不管如何，我们是知道底牌的一群人，所以，如果你再细心的按照此等思路，稍加研究，必定会大富大贵。但仅仅限于自己研究，切莫将本文发给某些大V和朋友，帮助你研究，信息渠道很多，稍加留意，自己就能上手。 \n  \n 过去牛市中，本圈子出现若干大v，沽名钓誉，最后都难以走远，反而害人害己。 这篇主要是给的信心，在未来的几年中，任何时候都不要害怕，不要恐慌，不要轻易割肉，直到终点或者你心满意足为止。也因此，我全面改变了过去的作战方针，不再短线操作任何币种，不再追逐热点题材，直到价格跌到我愿意买入，涨到我满意卖出为止。 \n  \n  在本文中，和过去不一样的是，我没有提出任何位置，因为从2020年以来，比特币已经完全偏离了过去的运行轨迹，比特币的定性随着社会认知的加深，也发生了巨大变化，关键是我本人也不懂k线技术分析，所以本篇不是一篇短线操作方案，仅供参考，请注意领会。（本句新增） 文后，这一篇很重要，也许能够再次实现你人生逆袭，我不会分享你一分钱，只希望四年后你身价过亿时，能记住这篇神文。但也许，因为公开的原因，会改变某些板块和币种的自身运作轨迹，万般皆是命，半点不由人。（本段今日新增) 修正版之所以添加了很多解释，是因为第一版发布后，很多人要和我交流，但是关于世界形势的分析，这种事情都是各有各的看法，交流并不是一件容易达成共识的事情，所以，只能你认为你的，我认为我的，互为一家之见，互为参考。（本段今日新增)", "timestamp": 1657130231, "digest": "-TreZ39tNIhUiG10rYUm8-8Kw7loPFioJ3fb_7SjyNE", "contributor": "0x154a309479E3CC5B40A363a419262601b9502B40"}

The crypto marketplace is no exception. Since our last update on May 23rd, ETH (Ethereum) has continued to decline from $2,100 to $1,100, which is now approaching an 80% selloff from its November high of $4,868. To add some perspective, the price of ETH is 21% lower today than during its bull run in 2017 ($1,396). \n\nFortunately, The WAGMI Fund’s discipline enabled us to stay cash-heavy throughout this downturn. Our strategy has significantly reduced losses to less than 10% from inception, which far exceeds performance in this sector. The WAGMI Fund currently has approximately 80% of its assets in cash/cash equivalents. We have allocated $354,000 in a high yield stablecoin ($GUSD) earning 6.9% APY, and an additional $70,000 in cash.\n\nWe strongly believe the current perception of the crypto market does not reflect the long-term viability of the technology, and is, in fact, an overreaction. Some indicators which support the adoption of crypto since 2017/18 are as follows: \n\n· The number of active crypto wallets has increased by **4.5x** (from 18 million to 82 million). \n\n· Since July 2020, the value of locked up money in decentralized finance (DeFi) has risen nearly **9x** from $9 billion to $80 billion. \n\n· NFT purchasing volume hit **$7 billion** in January 2022 alone ($35 million in 2018 in whole).\n\nBased on the above factors, as well as our charting indicators, we feel it is reasonable to determine that the crypto space has been ***extremely oversold*** due to fear sparked by global economic conditions. With high inflation and a struggling economy, investors typically look to sell their most volatile assets first (i.e., selling crypto before Apple). This fear-based sell-off creates a unique buying opportunity. Given the 2021 bull run being the most significant in terms of adoption and development in blockchain tech, we are confident a recovery will occur yet again once fears subside. \n\nWhile we closely monitor NFT and Metaverse opportunities, our emphasis will focus on purchasing Ethereum, the building block of crypto technology. \n\nWe plan on raising additional capital in the coming months in an effort to capitalize on these bear market opportunities to optimize returns. Our goal is for the fund to reach $1 million in assets under management by Q4, which will allow us to comfortably accumulate upwards of 500-750ETH and increase our metaverse positions.\n\nThose that make it to the other side of this market will reap the benefits of significant returns. The WAGMI Fund is positioned to successfully maneuver through these challenging times. Remember…We Are All Gonna Make It!\n\nKind regards,\n\nThe WAGMI Team", "timestamp": 1657130309, "digest": "TrBgKo9JJfHA09tV7JYzL5Pmp1zQZkIxC25RhDNTAVU", "contributor": "0x3a96cE3a88E90BD6B480fa99952Ddb3E2394215d"}

X2E 正在进化。\n\n而Fistiana所期待的 X2E 的进化，则是更克制的疯狂期、更慢速的退烧期，更高的公允价值回归线 - 这也是我认为 Fistiana 有潜力做到的。\n\nFistiana现在还不处于死亡螺旋，甚至就目前各类型资产铸造比例来看，死亡螺旋出现的阈值都还远未达到。玩家对投资亏损的沉没成本接受度是不同的，这也是导致本轮持续下跌的主要原因，我们把这部分玩家称为担忧的B类玩家。\n\n但事实是Fistiana目前的用户地址依然保持快速增长，俱乐部系统上线后我们看到俱乐部创办人在积极的做很多正向引导，他们爆发出的能量是无限的，能够为社区带来一种积极乐观的情绪，在这里我们称为幸运的A类玩家。\n\n我们希望能找到更多的A类玩家，去引导担忧的B类玩家和观望的C类玩家，这些玩家并不是固定的用户，而是一个时间节点下的用户群分类，B类玩家花了一定时间获得理想收益后会成为A类，而C类加入后又会变为B类。所以死亡螺旋并不可怕甚至并不存在，重要的是应该如何去考虑投资沉没成本，这也是你在投资任何一款产品时都需要面临的事情。\n\n ***8、Paul：是的，死亡螺旋是加密市场不可逃避的话题，然而在市场趋向 X2E 热度继续疯狂发力时，我们不仅不能对死亡螺旋避而不谈，反而更应该主动去了解死亡螺旋代表着什么，挑战如何在死亡螺旋的阴影下将项目做的长久，怎样的运营和理念才能在死亡螺旋的阴影下让用户、项目方与投资者同时最大化长期价值。我认为Fistiana团队做到了，也是为数不多的勇于直面死亡螺螺旋的产品团队，一个社区的能量离不开产品方的理念引导！今天真的是收货满满的一天，我们的沙龙也将进入尾声，您还有什么想要对社区讲的吗？***\n\n**Jerod：**感谢大家一直以来对Fistiana的支持与关注！对于许多建设者来说，加密社区仍然是一个谜，但它应该是项目整个生命周期中的一个重要方面。虽然采用大爆炸式方法可能很诱人，但Fistiana一直专注于建立一个与项目价值观一致的持久、可持续的社区。专注于在社区中培养拥护者并奖励此类型贡献者。无论好坏，我们都将始终对社区保持可见、开放和诚，我们希望能与所有跟随我们的人建立信任与尊重。这也是web3的底层理念：开放、隐私、共建。\n\n虽然争夺注意力的战争永远不会结束，但最好的团队知道社区并不是他们正在构建的产品之上的东西，它是其中的重要组成部分。\n\n对于每一个web3产品团队来讲，社区永远是最难破解的代码。我们希望能与社区保持充分的互相信任与尊重，社区永远都是Fistiana能够取得成功的重要环节，除此之外我们要做的事情依然很多，在这个过程中有很多困难，但我们必将全力以赴，将Fistiana的所有设计逐步实现使他成为一款伟大的web3产品! 再次感谢大家对Fsitiana的支持与关注！一路同行，Let’s Boxing Together!\n\n***9、Paul：好的，感谢Jerod！我看到中文社区的朋友依然有很多问题想要了解，鉴于时间有限，我们可以统一提交给#Chinese 频道管理@RED和@YUAN，discord系列沙龙将持续进行，我们会邀请团队成员来回答大家的问题及提议，感谢大家的参与！***", "timestamp": 1657134440, "digest": "eqOWChkCKZWY55Fpu5ttxpTTwlV1MjshlCouqOECbcE", "contributor": "0x7900781493f31671bcc598f434C14fA9f0872788"}

X2E 正在进化。\n\n而Fistiana所期待的 X2E 的进化，则是更克制的疯狂期、更慢速的退烧期，更高的公允价值回归线 - 这也是我认为 Fistiana 有潜力做到的。\n\nFistiana现在还不处于死亡螺旋，甚至就目前各类型资产铸造比例来看，死亡螺旋出现的阈值都还远未达到。玩家对投资亏损的沉没成本接受度是不同的，这也是导致本轮持续下跌的主要原因，我们把这部分玩家称为担忧的B类玩家。\n\n但事实是Fistiana目前的用户地址依然保持快速增长，俱乐部系统上线后我们看到俱乐部创办人在积极的做很多正向引导，他们爆发出的能量是无限的，能够为社区带来一种积极乐观的情绪，在这里我们称为幸运的A类玩家。\n\n我们希望能找到更多的A类玩家，去引导担忧的B类玩家和观望的C类玩家，这些玩家并不是固定的用户，而是一个时间节点下的用户群分类，B类玩家花了一定时间获得理想收益后会成为A类，而C类加入后又会变为B类。所以死亡螺旋并不可怕甚至并不存在，重要的是应该如何去考虑投资沉没成本，这也是你在投资任何一款产品时都需要面临的事情。\n\n ***8、Paul：是的，死亡螺旋是加密市场不可逃避的话题，然而在市场趋向 X2E 热度继续疯狂发力时，我们不仅不能对死亡螺旋避而不谈，反而更应该主动去了解死亡螺旋代表着什么，挑战如何在死亡螺旋的阴影下将项目做的长久，怎样的运营和理念才能在死亡螺旋的阴影下让用户、项目方与投资者同时最大化长期价值。我认为Fistiana团队做到了，也是为数不多的勇于直面死亡螺螺旋的产品团队，一个社区的能量离不开产品方的理念引导！今天真的是收货满满的一天，我们的沙龙也将进入尾声，您还有什么想要对社区讲的吗？***\n\n**Jerod：**感谢大家一直以来对Fistiana的支持与关注！对于许多建设者来说，加密社区仍然是一个谜，但它应该是项目整个生命周期中的一个重要方面。虽然采用大爆炸式方法可能很诱人，但Fistiana一直专注于建立一个与项目价值观一致的持久、可持续的社区。专注于在社区中培养拥护者并奖励此类型贡献者。无论好坏，我们都将始终对社区保持可见、开放和诚，我们希望能与所有跟随我们的人建立信任与尊重。这也是web3的底层理念：开放、隐私、共建。\n\n虽然争夺注意力的战争永远不会结束，但最好的团队知道社区并不是他们正在构建的产品之上的东西，它是其中的重要组成部分。\n\n对于每一个web3产品团队来讲，社区永远是最难破解的代码。我们希望能与社区保持充分的互相信任与尊重，社区永远都是Fistiana能够取得成功的重要环节，除此之外我们要做的事情依然很多，在这个过程中有很多困难，但我们必将全力以赴，将Fistiana的所有设计逐步实现使他成为一款伟大的web3产品! 再次感谢大家对Fsitiana的支持与关注！一路同行，Let’s Boxing Together!\n\n***9、Paul：好的，感谢Jerod！我看到中文社区的朋友依然有很多问题想要了解，鉴于时间有限，我们可以统一提交给#Chinese 频道管理@RED和@YUAN，discord系列沙龙将持续进行，我们会邀请团队成员来回答大家的问题及提议，感谢大家的参与！***", "timestamp": 1657134755, "digest": "eqOWChkCKZWY55Fpu5ttxpTTwlV1MjshlCouqOECbcE", "contributor": "0x7900781493f31671bcc598f434C14fA9f0872788"}

X2E 正在进化。\n\n而Fistiana所期待的 X2E 的进化，则是更克制的疯狂期、更慢速的退烧期，更高的公允价值回归线 - 这也是我认为 Fistiana 有潜力做到的。\n\nFistiana现在还不处于死亡螺旋，甚至就目前各类型资产铸造比例来看，死亡螺旋出现的阈值都还远未达到。玩家对投资亏损的沉没成本接受度是不同的，这也是导致本轮持续下跌的主要原因，我们把这部分玩家称为担忧的B类玩家。\n\n但事实是Fistiana目前的用户地址依然保持快速增长，俱乐部系统上线后我们看到俱乐部创办人在积极的做很多正向引导，他们爆发出的能量是无限的，能够为社区带来一种积极乐观的情绪，在这里我们称为幸运的A类玩家。\n\n我们希望能找到更多的A类玩家，去引导担忧的B类玩家和观望的C类玩家，这些玩家并不是固定的用户，而是一个时间节点下的用户群分类，B类玩家花了一定时间获得理想收益后会成为A类，而C类加入后又会变为B类。所以死亡螺旋并不可怕甚至并不存在，重要的是应该如何去考虑投资沉没成本，这也是你在投资任何一款产品时都需要面临的事情。\n\n ***8、Paul：是的，死亡螺旋是加密市场不可逃避的话题，然而在市场趋向 X2E 热度继续疯狂发力时，我们不仅不能对死亡螺旋避而不谈，反而更应该主动去了解死亡螺旋代表着什么，挑战如何在死亡螺旋的阴影下将项目做的长久，怎样的运营和理念才能在死亡螺旋的阴影下让用户、项目方与投资者同时最大化长期价值。我认为Fistiana团队做到了，也是为数不多的勇于直面死亡螺螺旋的产品团队，一个社区的能量离不开产品方的理念引导！今天真的是收货满满的一天，我们的沙龙也将进入尾声，您还有什么想要对社区讲的吗？***\n\n**Jerod：**感谢大家一直以来对Fistiana的支持与关注！对于许多建设者来说，加密社区仍然是一个谜，但它应该是项目整个生命周期中的一个重要方面。虽然采用大爆炸式方法可能很诱人，但Fistiana一直专注于建立一个与项目价值观一致的持久、可持续的社区。专注于在社区中培养拥护者并奖励此类型贡献者。无论好坏，我们都将始终对社区保持可见、开放和诚，我们希望能与所有跟随我们的人建立信任与尊重。这也是web3的底层理念：开放、隐私、共建。\n\n虽然争夺注意力的战争永远不会结束，但最好的团队知道社区并不是他们正在构建的产品之上的东西，它是其中的重要组成部分。\n\n对于每一个web3产品团队来讲，社区永远是最难破解的代码。我们希望能与社区保持充分的互相信任与尊重，社区永远都是Fistiana能够取得成功的重要环节，除此之外我们要做的事情依然很多，在这个过程中有很多困难，但我们必将全力以赴，将Fistiana的所有设计逐步实现使他成为一款伟大的web3产品! 再次感谢大家对Fsitiana的支持与关注！一路同行，Let’s Boxing Together!\n\n***9、Paul：好的，感谢Jerod！我看到中文社区的朋友依然有很多问题想要了解，鉴于时间有限，我们可以统一提交给#Chinese 频道管理@RED和@YUAN，discord系列沙龙将持续进行，我们会邀请团队成员来回答大家的问题及提议，感谢大家的参与！***", "timestamp": 1657134723, "digest": "eqOWChkCKZWY55Fpu5ttxpTTwlV1MjshlCouqOECbcE", "contributor": "0x7900781493f31671bcc598f434C14fA9f0872788"}

{"id": "sozoYmZjuW_q_8dD7WxJqqUMmX5YhhRDYeWkDG6u9dA", "title": "Katze", "body": "**I sometimes long** for summer, for sunshine to smile on me again. Other times I wish it never returns. I find myself too hot to do anything but evaporate all day. In winter I think better, the midday sun warms me enough to tackle the day head on with no problem. Never a degree to hot, never a degree too cold. Always right. It’s just the punishing mornings. Mornings never below zero, but single digits. Mornings with glistening grass sparkling in the sun rise, beautiful until the cold rushes your body. Frigid to the skin, muscle and bone. Everyone can see their breath plume into smoke, cluster, then vanish like it never happened.\n\nOut the back door of the kitchen there is a porch with a singular chair. A chair that waits for me every winter and abandons me every summer — abandoning me first before I abandon it. I sit down on it at eight, waiting for the sun to peek over the houses and walls to warm me up for the day. Sometimes its early, sometimes late. Sometimes the chair is pre-warmed, sometimes I brave the icy winds. But I always get my twenty or so minutes. Then go back into the kitchen, eat some bread and butter. As I chew I think of the tasks I have to do; who I need to talk to, the e-mails I need to write, the articles I need to write as well. A deep droning anxiety hums in the back of my head, worrying about old and new clients. *Will they like what I have done? Will they pay me? Will they continue to choose me in stead of someone else?*\n\nI walk over icy marble tile of the kitchen, then the even more icy marble of the hallway — all bare foot — to my room. I don’t remember when I started walking bare foot at home but it just stuck. My mother would always tell me to wear shoes, then she asked if my feet were cold, then the topic of my bare feet never rose up again. My dad didn’t mind to much during summer, winter was another thing. As the years strode along I felt weird not wearing shoes, like how some people can’t walk around without socks, I can’t not be bare. In heat or in cold, my feet will be bare. Luckily all the bedrooms are carpeted and I can be free to be bare as I write.\n\nMy desk. My work station. My forge. I work — and not work — for hours on end. When my door is closed all is jazz, structured but with space for expression — *ad libitum*. Sometimes I tackle work head on with the ferocity of a lion, resting only when everything is devoured. Other times I slack off — play video games, read novels — then feverishly finish before the deadline. And everything on between. Jazz like all genres of music can sometimes hit and sometimes miss. There is jazz done badly and jazz done beautifully. I make sure that I always finish before the deadline, everything fully edited with a day or two to spare. The hum in the back of my head keeps me on track.\n\nIn the evenings dinner is served. Four hot steaming plates for the four of us. Mom. Dad. Brother. Me. Mother next to dad, the children next to each other opposite the parents. We pray, and attack our plates. A topic is thrown on the table; how the day had been, how work is doing and so on. The usual. Something deeper sometimes gets thrown, three attack it but I say on the sidelines, most of the time I have nothing to say about the topic. When the topic has been disgust in its entirety, silence. Each to their own plate, each to their own digestion, each to their own world.\n\nThen the night sets in. I look back at all that I’ve done for the day then workout. In the dead of night I feel the workout more. I feel each muscle burn, the impact with the floor as I run, and my own heavy breath. A light sweat dampens my face. My breathing laboured. My muscles scream. Pain shooting aimless. I feel good. When I go to bed a warm halo-like haze hugs me like it misses me.\n\nSome nights I stare into the void of darkness. My eyes heavy. I yawn. But I never submit to my drowsiness— not until the night ages. One night I was remembering a long lost friend of mine. We last were in contact when we were young, in pre-school. I don’t remember his name. Barely remember his face. I can picture a boy with light brown skin and nothing more… the memory has all gone fuzzy and warped with generation loss. But I can feel what that friendship meant to the three year old version of me. How I wanted every moment with him. How I needed to sit next to him during class, and the total despair when that was impossible. A vague memory plays were we are out in the sun playing football with other kids. As young kids usually do, we were all bunched up together kick the ball and each other. I was next to him. Cut. I was in space near the “goals”, the ball floated in and I tapped it in for a goal. All the other kids were celebrating, but I didn’t truly celebrate until I celebrated with him. The tape plays and replays that same scene. Cut. Tears flow down my cheeks but I don’t feel sad or nostalgic. I don’t feel. I don’t feel anything.\n\nAnother night a dark cold consumed me from the inside out. I shivered and shook but I felt no warmer. I got out of my bed, jogged on the spot for a while, put on layers and layers on top, jumped back into bed, but I still shivered. I rubbed my hands together. Leg with leg too. I was still cold. I thought I was having chills, but I didn’t cough or feel sick in general. I got out my bed and jogged again — my legs were burning and I could feel a cramp coming — then jumping-jacks and press ups. I felt fine. I flopped back in my bed. The warm haze missing, replaced by that cold. I balled up in a heap of layers, blankets and covers. Hoping for that hug. Any hug. Anyone to wrap their arms around me.\n\nI wake up.\n\nWhite shirt, black shorts and a camo hoodie. If the day gets colder I’ll wear one of tracksuit bottoms — either the black one or and grey one. My legs lead me to the porch outside the kitchen. I say lead because my mind is still trying to figure out last night. My dream was so-so. 4/10. A bland unimaginative rework of yesterday’s events. Nothing interesting about the fake events and low in the accuracy score on the true events. The elephant was overkill and cliché. I find my self seated on my seat waiting for the sun. Cracked concrete spawns ants ready for today’s shift. They march past chair, past the concrete, into the dirt. The sun peeks over the horizon. The day begins.\n\nThe beams cut through the morning cold. I can feel the blood course through my veins, the first time this morning. Heat runs up my legs, over my knees and to my shorts. The air is dry. My nose runs, I check to see if its mucus or blood with my sleeve. I’m happy to see a clear line on my sleeve…a bush rustles. Stop. Continue. I fail to make its shape, but nothing. It comes closer. My heart thumps my chest. It stops. It moves. I’m nearly off my seat looking for a weapon to hold, anything to level the playing field. The grass shrills. A crunch. Then another fleeting shrill. I look up, the stray cat stares back.\n\n\n___\n\n**At school I** befriended the local cat. SC is was called, School Cat. Like most stray cats, she just wondered in and took care of the local rat population, but SC didn’t leave. Instead she boldly sat in front off the staff room and meowed until someone gave her some food. At first the teachers were annoyed, then they feel for her. There was something about her boldness that melted the hearts of even the heartless. She was given a collar and her own bowl after a month.\n\nShe later became fully established at school, regularly walking into class rooms through the door and sitting in the back. She would sleep or sit statue until just before the bell rang when she would leave. SC could also be found among the flowerbeds, keeping her hunting instincts sharp. She would stalk, prowl and pounce on incests. Though she looked like she was having fun, I knew that she it wasn’t all fun and games. It was work. These were the moments of her training montage, what she was training for no one knew. Her face looked worked and tired after those sessions, then off to the sun to sleep.\n\n“SC, here, knows the school timetable better than me!” my English teacher once told the the class. SC strode in, took a quick glance at my English teacher, their eyes meant, they nodded, and SC took her place in the back. During that lesson — literature, Shakespeare — I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. A gnawing sensation coming from the far left, below me. The lesson went on. my ears heard, I faced the front but I couldn’t ignore SC. I could feel her inquisitive gaze ripping through the monotony of the lesson. Perhaps this is what she does, she studies humans to be adopted, I thought. She could be looking at anyone in this room, she is not looking at you.\n\nThe bell rang. SC was still in the room. We packed. We left. As I walked out the door, SC gaze followed. I forgot about that lesson, about SC and about that feeling. My mind was fully focused on maths. I entered the room, sat at my seat and gave my Maths teacher my homework. Of course there was drama, someone always forgets their homework and we waist a good 20 minutes. The guys who forgot their homework were out the room doing it on the ground. I tackled my math problems while thinking of something else. From the corner of my eye, SC was sitting tall looking through the class window. I snapped back, I was finding X. After looping through a set of logical obstacles I found X. Next question. SC was still looking through. Find X. I found X. She was still looking.\n\nThroughout the day, I was plagued by thoughts of SC. In some lessons she didn’t appear. In others she did. At break-time she was looking over were the form fours hung out, the second storey above the art pavilion. It was now four p.m.. I was by myself, reading a novel. All my friends were picked up. My age mates too. I finished my homework and now I was waiting. SC walked over. She stood five metres away. She sat and began to study me. I stuffed my nose into my book, shielding my eyes from her. She walk over. Stopped. Sat. Studied. She continued until she was half a metre away from me. She stopped and lied on the ground, her eyes closed. We shared silence with each other.\n\nI found myself possessed by the idea that I should touch her. Goosebumps littered my body and back. SC stood walked closer and fell by my foot. Her eyes closed again, but this time I could see her eyes were only half closed. I understood what she wanted me to do. So I stretched out my hand and stroked her. She let out a soft low purr.\n\nThe next day, SC walked in during my English lesson, rubbed past my leg and head to her spot in the back. Then midway through she stood to sit next to me. At the end of that day SC leap onto my lap when everybody left and balled into a cute black fur-ball. Her breathing relaxed and effortless. The same thing happened the next day and the next. Soon I was playing with SC during break-time. Soon the whole school was abuzz with the news.\n\nI will never forget the day she died. It was late. She was balled on my lap purring. My dad pulled over. That was supposed to be the the cue for SC to jump off, but she didn’t, she just looked at me. Her eyes were sad. She never looked sad or worried. She always had sharp eyes, eyes of a hunter. Her body shrivelled up and she meowed. I tried to shoo her off. She meowed. I picked her up and placed her on the ground, SC meowed in protest — soft, hushed — but didn’t fight. I swung my bag or my shoulder. SC sat on the cold evening, meowing softer and softer. I waved goodbye. I got into the car. SC in the rear-view sat in the same spot, then she walked inside the school grounds. Her head low, each step slow.\n\nThe next day, my English teacher took me out of the class to tell me that SC was hit by a car. She hugged me and told me to take as much time as I needed. I was in the corridor alone trying to think. I tried and tried but all was blank. I couldn’t string a single clear line of thought in that moment. All I could here was SC’s sad meow.\n\n\n___\n\n**I sat up** , faced the sun and waited. From the corner of my eye I could see the stray eyeing me. His head tilting, ears twitching; seated then standing on all fours. He crept closer, a paw at a time. His eyes locked on a sun spot, a few metres from my leg, a rectangle of early morning sun. Step by step he crept, stalking the spot, a sharp look at me then back to the spot. I sat still, cooling my breath, calming my heartbeat. Every deep breathe brought him closer and closer. Until he balled up in the furthest corner of the rectangle. *It worked!*\n\nI tried to hid my smile, I didn’t want anything to chase him away. So I closed my eyes, letting the sun beam into my closed lids. Then a few hours passed. I woke up to see the stray sound asleep, but I woke him up straight afterwards with the chair scraping the floor. The stray whipped up and ran in one movement. He was now a good ten metres from me dashing into the bushes.\n\nI was behind. All sorts of deadlines were due and other projects needed to be started. My wrists burned after typing so much but I bit down and continued through the pain. Turning up the music to max, the “bangers” playlist roaring in my ears, I typed quicker and wasted no time with useless adverbs. So I thought. With the deadline tailing me, I spent more time editing my haphazard copy then typing it in the first place. My head was bursting. Teeth grinding. Tight muscles. That’s the cue. Time to get some air.\n\nThe sun was out, a rare summer afternoon in winter. I left my hoodie inside. I walked a fair distance, trying not to think about the deadlines, trying to enjoy the outdoors. God gifted us with good weather. But I was still jerky. I looked to the clouds, the floor, the falling leaves, but my mind often felt and sat in front of my laptop, working on the copy. I needed to breathe. I needed to be centre. To be mindful. To enjoy this moment, this moment in time, this day the the lord made, this time in the place in time-space, or is it space-time?\n\nThe stray looked on, on top of a large stone. His head tilted. Quizzical eyes darting at me.\n\n“Mind your own business”, I told him.\n\nThe stray tilted his head all the way to the other side.\n\n“I’m trying to relax”\n\nThe stray nodded.\n\n“Well, whatever… stop acting like you understand what I’m saying”\n\nThe stray rested, his front paws crossing in front, letting a silent yawn.\n\n“What’s wrong with you anyway? Why aren’t you running off or something?”\n\nThe stray let out a growling purr.\n\n“So what do you want me to do? Talk about my *problems?* My *deep dark problems?*”\n\nHe meowed yes.\n\n“Can you actually understand me?”\n\nHe meowed yes.\n\n“Like… you can understand everything I’m saying? Everything I’m actually saying?”\n\nYes. With a slight nod.\n\nI talked to him about my deadlines, the stray absorbed, nodding here and there and letting out a meow for approval and that growling purr when he was bored. After an hour or so I ran out of things to talk about. My mind was empty, clear as crystal. After a bit of meows and a purr he walked toward another bush. I asked if we could do it again the next day the stray answered a long drawn out meow, something like “Yeah, whatever”.\n\nI stepped inside, through on my hoodie and edited the rest of my copy. After a bit of work I was done. I submitted the copy in an e-mail, then started looking at cat memes. With every cat picture I saw, the memory of the stray would flash before me. His meows, his growl. His white and brown coat. His eyes. The more I replayed our conversation the more questions I had, the more things I wanted to say. This wasn’t the first time I had a bad case of staircase wit or staircase topics but this time I was limited. I couldn’t call him. I couldn’t text him. There wasn’t — to my knowledge — a Cat version of e-mail too. I had to wait for the next day.\n\nDuring dinner I talked less than usual. When asked I said that I was still thinking of work and stuffed my mouth with food. They talked about something. I nodded. I cleared my plate, washed every plate near the sink and thank mom for the food. Worked out earlier than usual. I barely got a sweat running before I jumped into bed. I ran some questions for stray — silly things, serious things — for the next day. In the dark, I decided to name stray. Katze seemed to be the best name for stray. Something foreign yet common. Something close but far. Katze is German for “Cat”, something I stumbled on when I was messing around on Google translate. I threw a whole bunch of words but Katze is the only one I remember. Yes, I am a cat person but I’m a curious one too. I have never owned a cat — my mom hates them — so all my love for felines is from afar. The school cat was always some what stray, though she had a collar and a name. I loved her, the first time I have ever loved anything that wasn’t human. With SC it made sense, I loved her. Then she died.\n\nI woke up earlier than my alarm, my cold toes woke me up. My room was dark, lit by the eerie morning light, six on the clock. The carpet was ice cold, like wet ice. I change out my PJs, wore longs, the thermal ones I got from my aunt and a random shirt and sweater. I switched on my laptop, read through e-mails, nothing new. Looked over my projects, three still active due in a couple days. Opened all the docs, reading through all I did the days before. I choose to continue with the article for a tech company, 500 words done, the post is simple enough.\n\nMy alarm rang. I switched it off and headed down outside. My heart started racing halfway out the room. I ran back into my room, pressed ctrl+S, then headed out again still a bit shaky. In the kitchen I stole a bite; bread, jam, peanut butter. The sun was already rising. *Maybe Katze is out already?*\n\nKatze stretched in the sun rectangle then balled. I was temped to pet him, but his eye stopped me. I sat in silence, only movie to get comfortable. The air picked up a little, rising then standing still. I tried to fined something to say, everything from the night before vanished without a trace. A thick fog clouded my current thoughts too. Bored, Katze tried keeping his head up, then the sun hit him, his ball got smaller and tighter. He looked at me. I looked back. He closed his eyes. Fast asleep.\n\nJust like the day before, when I got up Katze left. This time I was quite. Katze also left slower, strolling into the bushes. I got back to my desk. I typed and typed. Backspaced almost everything, then typed again. The fog was still heavy; ideas, words and grammar unrecognisable in muck. I saved what I did. 1000 words survived but a few of them will be dead. More than a few. I opened up solitaire. Click. Click. Click. I closed solitaire mid-game. Out my window, Katze was pacing back and forth by some flower pots. His head low, stomping on the floor almost. I wonder what he was thinking about. What struggles was he going through? What was he punishing himself for? I saw a meme were a cat ran up to her owner after some of her food was eaten by another pet. She was so angry! Katze was not that angry, though.\n\nThat afternoon told Katze about SC. I told him about how we met and how it all ended. Katze listened. Really listened. His ears were pointed at the start, all the fun parts of our relationship. His ears drooped, eyes tearing up when I talked about the end. I was tearing up too. I was something about Katze, how he reacted — his eyes, his posture, his ears — that hit me. SC flashed next to Katze, then SC vanished leaving her cries for me. Katze started shivering, letting out cold long cries. Katze’s cry. SC’s cry. Both singing to me, burning my ears.\n\n“I don’t know if you can understand me”, I began, “But I can’t take care of you. I can’t…”\n\nKatze let out a sad meow.\n\n“My mom hates cats… above that, I can’t feed you… you know. Food is expensive for humans, let alone a cat.”\n\nI know, Katze meowed.\n\n“I know you wanted me to adopt you… I know you chose that place near me to get closer to me…” — tears ran down my face — “I mean I have a hard time taking care of my self… I still live with my parents. I don’t make enough to live off of too. I’m just still a kid. I’m sorry…”\n\nKatze walked over to me. I bent over picked him up and hugged him. I brought him to my chest. He purred — sweet, soft — right next to my ear. As I cried, Katze rubbed his face on wet cheek, saying “It’s okay”. I sat down in the dirt and continued to hold him.\n\n“I think you should leave… I think its for the best” I whispered. Katze blinked slowly, then struggled out my hands. He walked down the driveway, skipped on the flower bed and again on the wall. He looked back, called to me one last time then jumped over the wall. He was gone.\n\nI stepped inside. Washed my face. Headed to the kitchen. Toasted some bread. Slide butter over the warm toast, watching the butter ooze into a liquid. I ate the sandwich, ripping it into bite sizes before throwing them in my mouth. I then sat at my desk. Backspace. Everything. Start afresh.\n\n\n___\n\nTwitter: @TJohnShumba", "timestamp": 1657135157, "digest": "-0phPHgzAhXJOyUb-iOV9u-P0N3vqZQl-JsSVPcLxwM", "contributor": "0x2f2ceDd2999AaeE4A66dEf417A01F31AcbE67944"}

The Network boasts a flourishing community that comprises developers, influential creators, and entrepreneurs of all stripes, pursuing projects that span a spectrum of sectors.** \n\nAmong these are: [Rally.io](http://rally.io/) and [Unite.io](http://unite.io/), creator economy apps for the US and Asia, respectively; [Taki](https://taki.app/about/), a tokenized social network for Asia; [Hotline](https://www.gethotline.xyz/), a tokenized creator communications platform; [Joyride](https://www.onjoyride.com/), a tokenized platform for game creators; and [Gambit](https://getgambit.xyz/), a tokenized fantasy sports platform, along with many other projects that will soon come to market.  \n ** \n **Developers from any project can instantly access the permissionless, open source, no-fee, multi-chain RLY Protocol to build their own app, on [Rly.Network](https://rly.network/). The Protocol takes the guess-work out of building tokenized economies, providing developers with a seamless experience and benefits from powerful network effects fostered by RLY Network. Below, we explore its core features.\n\n![Above: RLY Protocol enables developers to easily launch Token Economies. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Enh1pmCrn02ILNBzoTYdJ.png?height=1094&width=1502)\n\n**Align Incentives With Your Community**\nDevelopers can ensure that they’re in-step with their community by leveraging RLY Protocol’s Incentive Alignment features. Our native ERC-20 token, $RLY, has a fixed supply of 15 billion tokens which will be released over the course of 8 years. Approximately 50% of the $RLY supply has been allocated to automated rewards for RLY Network contributors, meaning developers can easily secure financial value from their work. Grants from RLY Network Association and RLY Ecosystem DAO, a fund dedicated to supporting RLY Network, are also available.\n\nLikewise, the Protocol will offer Wallet Scoring, which will index and aggregate wallet-level token flows and app usage. Be sure to subscribe to our newsletter to get upcoming announcements for this feature. \n \n**Launch Tokens With Instant Pricing & Liquidity**\nRLY Protocol offers Token Bonding Curves—mathematical formulas that define the relationship between a token’s supply and asset price—to provide instant price discovery, immediate liquidity, and nurture network effects. Likewise, developers can take advantage of our token design templates and libraries, which contain illustrative token economic designs based on RLY Network project launches. These resources contain guidance on topics such as navigating liquidity fragmentation and the effective use of both fungible and non-fungible tokens.\n\n**Earn RLY Rewards to Grow your App**\nRLY Network believes in aligned incentives between members of the ecosystem. RLY Protocol offers builders the opportunity to earn RLY Rewards: $RLY tokens sent to the wallet of the developer when the token economy of the app is growing. These earnings can be used to fund future growth of the app, fund operating costs, or to share with community members, the choice is up to the developer. Entrepreneurs can earn rewards from RLY Protocol, without giving away equity in a fundraising event. \n  \n **Make Your Vision Multi-chain**\nRLY Protocol makes use of popular token bridges to enable developers to bring $RLY to their preferred chain via canonical wrappers. Likewise, RLY Protocol offers chain-specific modifications to $RLY, Token Bonding Curves, RLY Rewards computations, and Wallet Scoring. Developers can also benefit from Swap Routing—efficient trade execution across multiple on-chain liquidity pools for tokens bonded to $RLY via Token Bonding Curves. \n \n**RLY Protocol In Action: the Growing RLY Network** RLY Protocol has already been applied to a variety of use cases, including the creator economy, social networks, fantasy sports, messaging platforms, loyalty programs, and games. \n  \n \n\n![Above: RLY Network is powered by RLY Protocol token economy software suite, a multi-chain, permissionless, no-fee, open-source protocol for developers. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0fHMcI5EWeG_wQC1FOi-0.png?height=1398&width=2482)\n\nThe RLY Network is steadily growing as communities across a range of industries seek better incentive alignment, more ownership, and the ability to participate in governance, including in: social apps, SoFi, media and entertainment, NFT communities, metaverse apps, and many more.\n\nReady to join us?

{"id": "1xnsXe3IfL63WJd5lof0rXfvE2WBCJjc7IR9Q9yvkqA", "title": "Universe for Sale", "body": "I’ve been selling things for a long time. I was the one rounding up my family’s junk to become another’s treasure in our first and last yard sale, the one begging mom at age twelve for $100 to buy the beeswax I needed to make and peddle lip balms, the one who, as soon as I was old enough for a credit card, signed up to sell jewelry at an online craft marketplace, the first of its a kind and a revolution at the time. I wasn’t particularly crafty; I just really liked making and selling things.\n\n“In the modern world of business, it is useless to be a creative, original thinker unless you can also sell what you create,” said David Ogilvy, father of modern advertising. Point taken. Business became my training ground and I went on to sell many other things, then helped other people sell things, *then* helped other people helping other people sell things. Last year, I sold $43 million dollars of product in three months for one company.\n\nI’m a copywriter. I write to sell, wielding words like honey. But once, when all that could be measured were sales at the end of a neatly compartmentalized quarter, today our honey needs to attract sales, yes, but also eyeballs, clicks, and the red zone on heat-maps—and our measures of success come in like clockwork in real time. When once our words went up the chain for approval, perhaps to a creative director, today they go through almost the entire business, left to right, bottom to top: everyone is involved in words and messaging from the CEO to the designer to the marketing team to the support team. We go through rounds of revisions until we get what we want: “yes, this is it” or at least “I like where this is going”. And we keep going, rounds and rounds later: me and my keyboard, me in the shower, me scanning emails, thesauruses, memes for inspiration. We can be ruthless: we cut things we loved, break apart words and sentences then put them back together again. But we’re never heartless: feelings, always (just make them count, up and to the right). Benefits over features. Try this formula, or that one. Don’t forget your keywords. Style guides, once our bibles but now, if they exist at all, are just loose guidelines because “it’ll change”, they say as if we’ll catch up; we never do; we just keep selling. Everyone has opinions, but you just wait: none of matters except the winners in our next A/B test when one will be crowned the winner, even if it’s nonsensical and written by AI. Even AI can’t rest easy. Someone is always looking to overthrow the winner in the name of conversion.\n\nAnd it’s not just me, the writer. There’s an entire web of us trying to sell: designers looking for the button with the just-right hex code to drive the most clicks, engineers who code algorithms to turn your data and preferences into just the right ads, an entire conglomerate of the most creative people and companies dedicated to selling things, named as if to say we are independent, that we make our own choices when our entire goal is to shape the purchasing choices of everyone else. Together we manufacture scarcity, urgency, necessity like an assembly line: faster, cheaper, make it pop, more wow. Then they buy. Oh, they buy.\n\nThey chase things they didn’t even want. They try to keep up, but now they work so they can buy—things they want and things they don’t, things they can’t even flaunt and things they don’t even own. We bought the world when it wasn’t enough, then we made more. Now we’re selling things even less logical than it is to sell sugar and tooth rot as happiness, or to tie happiness to polar bears when they are so deadly that should you ever come across one in real life, you will want to run when in fact you should slowly back away.\n\nOh, but I’m not a cynic. Writing is fun. Writing is magic. Writing is power. How else do you explain everything that can be done with words? Empires, movements, love stories, songs that’ve gone down in memory, all the wonderful truths amidst the lies.\n\nIt’s just that we, or I at least (and maybe you), spend a lot of my mind, my time, and therefore, my life, trying to sell things. And everything we sell just like everything else, ends up as junk or less than that. The things that disappointed: words breaking promises, money-back guarantees that weren’t real, all the things tagged, unwanted and unused, everything we simply forgot about. And yes, the things that succeeded: all the products that made it, the best ideas, the most ingenious inventions. All of it is fleeting, even the most “real” of them all: the plastic that lives forever, the greatest companies in the world.\n\nI wondered: What would you sell if you could sell anything? *(You can.)* Would you remind someone of the wonder they already know? *(You should).* Could you sell the things that we’ve stopped paying attention to? *(Let’s try.)*\n\nLook up, smell the flowers, stop your scroll. The universe is here for you to have and to hold.\n\n\\#\n\n**[UNIVERSE FOR SALE](https://foundation.app/collection/universe4sale)** is a collection of writings from Ana Wang celebrating the generic, ordinary, and mundane as fractals of the extraordinary and wonderful universe.

{"id": "ZMVrm7ELBB8q18nh2x5g9Xyzy-rmt2ilYMc3BGrA9tI", "title": "Welcome To MovieTheaterDAO", "body": "## What is MovieTheaterDAO?\n\nInspired by projects like LinksDAO or ConstitutionDAO, MovieTheaterDAO is an organization with the primary goal of purchasing the lease of a multi-screen movie theater in a major urban center in the U.S. MovieTheaterDAO will leverage the organizational structure of a DAO and NFT ownership to help create a concept for an entertainment hub that better utilizes the modern theatrical retail space, and tailors it to what the community wants and needs. We will create a better theater, by the people, for the people.\n\n## What does this mean in real terms?\n\nMovieTheaterDAO aims to redefine the utility of the modern movie theater by reimagining it as a multi-use space with a community-driven programming format. This would not just be for theatrical film entertainment, but could include: musical performances, comedy shows, seminars, [VR rooms,](https://dreamscapeimmersive.com) educational offerings using screens and VR for schools and universities, NFT galleries, watch-parties for TV shows, co-working spaces, and so many other possibilities, all utilizing the same physical space of a movie theater. What if you could implement a tokenized system of ticketing, instead of USD? Instead of a generic, popcorn-scented lobby with the basic concessions, imagine a multi-use atrium that offered bold flavors like Thai food, Tacos, or Mediterranean. We would also work on partnering with any and all entertainment-related web3 communities to become the official entertainment hub of web3. MovieTheaterDAO hopes to be the de-facto theater where web3-funded films and TV shows host their premieres. We would also be an obvious choice for independent films to host their premieres or show screenings, as we would aim to remove much of the bureaucratic red-tape that usually stands in the way of independent filmmakers. If you are a MovieTheaterDAO member, you will automatically have a screen to share your projects with the world.\n\nImagine all of these possibilities, with the governance of a laser-focused DAO, led by experienced professionals from the entertainment and theatrical industries, web3, and other relevant fields. Wouldn’t this be a far more efficient and equitable way to use the space of a 25k sq. ft multiplex than the way these spaces are currently being used? *As a DAO, we will buy and/or develop a movie theater to meet these goals.*\n\n## Why MovieTheaterDAO?\n\nTheaters all across the globe are struggling with [lowered attendance](https://news.gallup.com/poll/388538/movie-theater-attendance-far-below-historical-norms.aspx) and increased overhead costs. The most crucial economic hurdle that the modern theater or multiplex faces isn’t simply the waning demand relative to the growing global entertainment economy, but that the rising cost of real estate for housing one or several screens has become untenable relative to the public’s interest in going to the theater. If the real issue here is space, then the seemingly obvious solution would be to pivot to a different business model that utilizes these enormous retail spaces in a vastly different way during non-prime hours.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IEQzeyF1YrogOxnl5I0kz.png?height=548&width=1124)\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the major theater chains have been unwilling to make drastic changes to this business model. Not only do they fear that radical changes would lead to a more rapid consolidation of their industry, they lack the vision necessary to create the entertainment experience of the future.\n\nThat is why it is on us to fix this broken model and create one that better services our needs, without the baggage that these corporations carry. *The best path forward in achieving this goal is to leverage the utility of web3 community-building and fundraising, with the organizational structure of a DAO to help govern our collective resources. The best path forward is MovieTheaterDAO.*\n\n## Phase 1\n\nWith Phase 1 we will aim to achieve these main goals:\n\n* Build a robust community that will participate in creating our vision and roadmap. This will involve the use of socials like Twitter, Discord, Instagram, and a website.\n* Plan and execute an NFT sale to raise the necessary funds to purchase the lease of a theater space and to fund the costs of renovation, as well as construction of our other concepts for the space, while also building an operating treasury. Compliant with all U.S. securities laws, these NFTs will represent degrees of token allocation and will count as memberships and vendor passes to MovieTheaterDAO and the ensuing entertainment hub that we will create.\n* Build a team through our community and source for relevant experts, creating roles that will be compensated through our treasury. Our team will systematically work on projects to be determined by our leaders and our community.\n* Begin process of identifying retail options for our movie theater. We will either identify and focus on a single retail space, or we will create a concept that we will shop to multiple retail developers. This will have to be in a major urban center, most likely Los Angeles but possibly New York, or even Miami. The founder of MovieTheaterDAO is already in talks with a real estate firm representing a recently closed multiplex in the center of Los Angeles, who are in the pre-planning stages of renovating and redesigning the space. We will make community-based decisions on how to approach our retail options, but creating a proposal to bring to the aforementioned space in L.A. will likely be one of our initial projects.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nJw1wtvC0LfIy9-vtrw89.png?height=509&width=1000)\n\n## Community\n\nWe aren’t just looking for film and entertainment fanatics, but for anyone who is enthusiastic about the potential use-cases for web3 and community-building through the blockchain. So if you love movie theaters, hate movie theaters, or anything in between, we want you to help us build the official entertainment hub of the future!", "timestamp": 1657136109, "digest": "JLYIaGO0rNWTZfipaZbbKKn9rqELuM7UNjBAiIK1Fqw", "contributor": "0x78A21C541d0FB0BC7e09d3bCa17d05F6aaB4027C"}

The Network boasts a flourishing community that comprises developers, influential creators, and entrepreneurs of all stripes, pursuing projects that span a spectrum of sectors.**\n\nAmong these are: [Rally.io](http://rally.io/) and [Unite.io](http://unite.io/), creator economy apps for the US and Asia, respectively; [Taki](https://taki.app/about/), a tokenized social network for Asia; [Hotline](https://www.gethotline.xyz/), a tokenized creator communications platform; [Joyride](https://www.onjoyride.com/), a tokenized platform for game creators; and [Gambit](https://getgambit.xyz/), a tokenized fantasy sports platform, along with many other projects that will soon come to market. \n\\*\\*\n\\*\\*Developers from any project can instantly access the permissionless, open source, no-fee, multi-chain RLY Protocol to build their own app, on [Rly.Network](https://rly.network/). The Protocol takes the guess-work out of building tokenized economies, providing developers with a seamless experience and benefits from powerful network effects fostered by RLY Network. Below, we explore its core features.\n\n![Above: RLY Protocol enables developers to easily launch Token Economies. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Enh1pmCrn02ILNBzoTYdJ.png?height=1094&width=1502)\n\n**Align Incentives With Your Community**\nDevelopers can ensure that they’re in-step with their community by leveraging RLY Protocol’s Incentive Alignment features. Our native ERC-20 token, $RLY, has a fixed supply of 15 billion tokens which will be released over the course of 8 years. Approximately 50% of the $RLY supply has been allocated to automated rewards for RLY Network contributors, meaning developers can easily secure financial value from their work. Grants from RLY Network Association and RLY Ecosystem DAO, a fund dedicated to supporting RLY Network, are also available.\n\nLikewise, the Protocol will offer Wallet Scoring, which will index and aggregate wallet-level token flows and app usage. Be sure to subscribe to our newsletter to get upcoming announcements for this feature.\n\n**Launch Tokens With Instant Pricing & Liquidity**\nRLY Protocol offers Token Bonding Curves—mathematical formulas that define the relationship between a token’s supply and asset price—to provide instant price discovery, immediate liquidity, and nurture network effects. Likewise, [developers can take advantage of our token design templates and libraries](https://rly-network.gitbook.io/rly-protocol/getting-started/rly-protocol-quick-start-guide), which contain illustrative token economic designs based on RLY Network project launches. These resources contain guidance on topics such as navigating liquidity fragmentation and the effective use of both fungible and non-fungible tokens.\n\n**Earn RLY Rewards to Grow your App**\nRLY Network believes in aligned incentives between members of the ecosystem. RLY Protocol offers builders the opportunity to earn [RLY Rewards](https://rly-network.gitbook.io/rly-protocol/rly-rewards/rly-network-rewards): $RLY tokens sent to the wallet of the developer when the token economy of the app is growing. These earnings can be used to fund future growth of the app, fund operating costs, or to share with community members, the choice is up to the developer. Entrepreneurs can earn rewards from RLY Protocol, without giving away equity in a fundraising event.\n\n**Make Your Vision Multi-chain**\nRLY Protocol makes use of popular token bridges to enable developers to bring $RLY to their preferred chain via canonical wrappers. Likewise, RLY Protocol offers chain-specific modifications to $RLY, Token Bonding Curves, RLY Rewards computations, and Wallet Scoring. Developers can also benefit from Swap Routing—efficient trade execution across multiple on-chain liquidity pools for tokens bonded to $RLY via Token Bonding Curves.\n\n**RLY Protocol In Action: the Growing RLY Network** RLY Protocol has already been applied to a variety of use cases, including the creator economy, social networks, fantasy sports, messaging platforms, loyalty programs, and games.\n\n![Above: RLY Network is powered by RLY Protocol token economy software suite, a multi-chain, permissionless, no-fee, open-source protocol for developers. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0fHMcI5EWeG_wQC1FOi-0.png?height=1398&width=2482)\n\nThe RLY Network is steadily growing as communities across a range of industries seek better incentive alignment, more ownership, and the ability to participate in governance, including in: social apps, SoFi, media and entertainment, NFT communities, metaverse apps, and many more.\n\nReady to join us?

{"id": "YGQ2t4m9Px22JAzw0Kw6ZYIwWSfPPc8ySS9v0YhcMjs", "title": "Katze", "body": "**I sometimes long** for summer, for sunshine to smile on me again. Other times I wish it never returns. I find myself too hot to do anything but evaporate all day. In winter I think better, the midday sun warms me enough to tackle the day head on with no problem. Never a degree to hot, never a degree too cold. Always right. It’s just the punishing mornings. Mornings never below zero, but single digits. Mornings with glistening grass sparkling in the sun rise, beautiful until the cold rushes your body. Frigid to the skin, muscle and bone. Everyone can see their breath plume into smoke, cluster, then vanish like it never happened.\n\nOut the back door of the kitchen there is a porch with a singular chair. A chair that waits for me every winter and abandons me every summer — abandoning me first before I abandon it. I sit down on it at eight, waiting for the sun to peek over the houses and walls to warm me up for the day. Sometimes its early, sometimes late. Sometimes the chair is pre-warmed, sometimes I brave the icy winds. But I always get my twenty or so minutes. Then go back into the kitchen, eat some bread and butter. As I chew I think of the tasks I have to do; who I need to talk to, the e-mails I need to write, the articles I need to write as well. A deep droning anxiety hums in the back of my head, worrying about old and new clients. *Will they like what I have done? Will they pay me? Will they continue to choose me in stead of someone else?*\n\nI walk over icy marble tile of the kitchen, then the even more icy marble of the hallway — all bare foot — to my room. I don’t remember when I started walking bare foot at home but it just stuck. My mother would always tell me to wear shoes, then she asked if my feet were cold, then the topic of my bare feet never rose up again. My dad didn’t mind to much during summer, winter was another thing. As the years strode along I felt weird not wearing shoes, like how some people can’t walk around without socks, I can’t not be bare. In heat or in cold, my feet will be bare. Luckily all the bedrooms are carpeted and I can be free to be bare as I write.\n\nMy desk. My work station. My forge. I work — and not work — for hours on end. When my door is closed all is jazz, structured but with space for expression — *ad libitum*. Sometimes I tackle work head on with the ferocity of a lion, resting only when everything is devoured. Other times I slack off — play video games, read novels — then feverishly finish before the deadline. And everything on between. Jazz like all genres of music can sometimes hit and sometimes miss. There is jazz done badly and jazz done beautifully. I make sure that I always finish before the deadline, everything fully edited with a day or two to spare. The hum in the back of my head keeps me on track.\n\nIn the evenings dinner is served. Four hot steaming plates for the four of us. Mom. Dad. Brother. Me. Mother next to dad, the children next to each other opposite the parents. We pray, and attack our plates. A topic is thrown on the table; how the day had been, how work is doing and so on. The usual. Something deeper sometimes gets thrown, three attack it but I say on the sidelines, most of the time I have nothing to say about the topic. When the topic has been disgust in its entirety, silence. Each to their own plate, each to their own digestion, each to their own world.\n\nThen the night sets in. I look back at all that I’ve done for the day then workout. In the dead of night I feel the workout more. I feel each muscle burn, the impact with the floor as I run, and my own heavy breath. A light sweat dampens my face. My breathing laboured. My muscles scream. Pain shooting aimless. I feel good. When I go to bed a warm halo-like haze hugs me like it misses me.\n\nSome nights I stare into the void of darkness. My eyes heavy. I yawn. But I never submit to my drowsiness— not until the night ages. One night I was remembering a long lost friend of mine. We last were in contact when we were young, in pre-school. I don’t remember his name. Barely remember his face. I can picture a boy with light brown skin and nothing more… the memory has all gone fuzzy and warped with generation loss. But I can feel what that friendship meant to the three year old version of me. How I wanted every moment with him. How I needed to sit next to him during class, and the total despair when that was impossible. A vague memory plays were we are out in the sun playing football with other kids. As young kids usually do, we were all bunched up together kick the ball and each other. I was next to him. Cut. I was in space near the “goals”, the ball floated in and I tapped it in for a goal. All the other kids were celebrating, but I didn’t truly celebrate until I celebrated with him. The tape plays and replays that same scene. Cut. Tears flow down my cheeks but I don’t feel sad or nostalgic. I don’t feel. I don’t feel anything.\n\nAnother night a dark cold consumed me from the inside out. I shivered and shook but I felt no warmer. I got out of my bed, jogged on the spot for a while, put on layers and layers on top, jumped back into bed, but I still shivered. I rubbed my hands together. Leg with leg too. I was still cold. I thought I was having chills, but I didn’t cough or feel sick in general. I got out my bed and jogged again — my legs were burning and I could feel a cramp coming — then jumping-jacks and press ups. I felt fine. I flopped back in my bed. The warm haze missing, replaced by that cold. I balled up in a heap of layers, blankets and covers. Hoping for that hug. Any hug. Anyone to wrap their arms around me.\n\nI wake up.\n\nWhite shirt, black shorts and a camo hoodie. If the day gets colder I’ll wear one of tracksuit bottoms — either the black one or and grey one. My legs lead me to the porch outside the kitchen. I say lead because my mind is still trying to figure out last night. My dream was so-so. 4/10. A bland unimaginative rework of yesterday’s events. Nothing interesting about the fake events and low in the accuracy score on the true events. The elephant was overkill and cliché. I find my self seated on my seat waiting for the sun. Cracked concrete spawns ants ready for today’s shift. They march past chair, past the concrete, into the dirt. The sun peeks over the horizon. The day begins.\n\nThe beams cut through the morning cold. I can feel the blood course through my veins, the first time this morning. Heat runs up my legs, over my knees and to my shorts. The air is dry. My nose runs, I check to see if its mucus or blood with my sleeve. I’m happy to see a clear line on my sleeve…a bush rustles. Stop. Continue. I fail to make its shape, but nothing. It comes closer. My heart thumps my chest. It stops. It moves. I’m nearly off my seat looking for a weapon to hold, anything to level the playing field. The grass shrills. A crunch. Then another fleeting shrill. I look up, the stray cat stares back.\n\n\n___\n\n**At school I** befriended the local cat. SC is was called, School Cat. Like most stray cats, she just wondered in and took care of the local rat population, but SC didn’t leave. Instead she boldly sat in front off the staff room and meowed until someone gave her some food. At first the teachers were annoyed, then they feel for her. There was something about her boldness that melted the hearts of even the heartless. She was given a collar and her own bowl after a month.\n\nShe later became fully established at school, regularly walking into class rooms through the door and sitting in the back. She would sleep or sit statue until just before the bell rang when she would leave. SC could also be found among the flowerbeds, keeping her hunting instincts sharp. She would stalk, prowl and pounce on incests. Though she looked like she was having fun, I knew that she it wasn’t all fun and games. It was work. These were the moments of her training montage, what she was training for no one knew. Her face looked worked and tired after those sessions, then off to the sun to sleep.\n\n“SC, here, knows the school timetable better than me!” my English teacher once told the the class. SC strode in, took a quick glance at my English teacher, their eyes meant, they nodded, and SC took her place in the back. During that lesson — literature, Shakespeare — I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. A gnawing sensation coming from the far left, below me. The lesson went on. my ears heard, I faced the front but I couldn’t ignore SC. I could feel her inquisitive gaze ripping through the monotony of the lesson. Perhaps this is what she does, she studies humans to be adopted, I thought. She could be looking at anyone in this room, she is not looking at you.\n\nThe bell rang. SC was still in the room. We packed. We left. As I walked out the door, SC gaze followed. I forgot about that lesson, about SC and about that feeling. My mind was fully focused on maths. I entered the room, sat at my seat and gave my Maths teacher my homework. Of course there was drama, someone always forgets their homework and we waist a good 20 minutes. The guys who forgot their homework were out the room doing it on the ground. I tackled my math problems while thinking of something else. From the corner of my eye, SC was sitting tall looking through the class window. I snapped back, I was finding X. After looping through a set of logical obstacles I found X. Next question. SC was still looking through. Find X. I found X. She was still looking.\n\nThroughout the day, I was plagued by thoughts of SC. In some lessons she didn’t appear. In others she did. At break-time she was looking over were the form fours hung out, the second storey above the art pavilion. It was now four p.m.. I was by myself, reading a novel. All my friends were picked up. My age mates too. I finished my homework and now I was waiting. SC walked over. She stood five metres away. She sat and began to study me. I stuffed my nose into my book, shielding my eyes from her. She walk over. Stopped. Sat. Studied. She continued until she was half a metre away from me. She stopped and lied on the ground, her eyes closed. We shared silence with each other.\n\nI found myself possessed by the idea that I should touch her. Goosebumps littered my body and back. SC stood walked closer and fell by my foot. Her eyes closed again, but this time I could see her eyes were only half closed. I understood what she wanted me to do. So I stretched out my hand and stroked her. She let out a soft low purr.\n\nThe next day, SC walked in during my English lesson, rubbed past my leg and head to her spot in the back. Then midway through she stood to sit next to me. At the end of that day SC leap onto my lap when everybody left and balled into a cute black fur-ball. Her breathing relaxed and effortless. The same thing happened the next day and the next. Soon I was playing with SC during break-time. Soon the whole school was abuzz with the news.\n\nI will never forget the day she died. It was late. She was balled on my lap purring. My dad pulled over. That was supposed to be the the cue for SC to jump off, but she didn’t, she just looked at me. Her eyes were sad. She never looked sad or worried. She always had sharp eyes, eyes of a hunter. Her body shrivelled up and she meowed. I tried to shoo her off. She meowed. I picked her up and placed her on the ground, SC meowed in protest — soft, hushed — but didn’t fight. I swung my bag or my shoulder. SC sat on the cold evening, meowing softer and softer. I waved goodbye. I got into the car. SC in the rear-view sat in the same spot, then she walked inside the school grounds. Her head low, each step slow.\n\nThe next day, my English teacher took me out of the class to tell me that SC was hit by a car. She hugged me and told me to take as much time as I needed. I was in the corridor alone trying to think. I tried and tried but all was blank. I couldn’t string a single clear line of thought in that moment. All I could here was SC’s sad meow.\n\n\n___\n\n**I sat up** , faced the sun and waited. From the corner of my eye I could see the stray eyeing me. His head tilting, ears twitching; seated then standing on all fours. He crept closer, a paw at a time. His eyes locked on a sun spot, a few metres from my leg, a rectangle of early morning sun. Step by step he crept, stalking the spot, a sharp look at me then back to the spot. I sat still, cooling my breath, calming my heartbeat. Every deep breathe brought him closer and closer. Until he balled up in the furthest corner of the rectangle. *It worked!*\n\nI tried to hid my smile, I didn’t want anything to chase him away. So I closed my eyes, letting the sun beam into my closed lids. Then a few hours passed. I woke up to see the stray sound asleep, but I woke him up straight afterwards with the chair scraping the floor. The stray whipped up and ran in one movement. He was now a good ten metres from me dashing into the bushes.\n\nI was behind. All sorts of deadlines were due and other projects needed to be started. My wrists burned after typing so much but I bit down and continued through the pain. Turning up the music to max, the “bangers” playlist roaring in my ears, I typed quicker and wasted no time with useless adverbs. So I thought. With the deadline tailing me, I spent more time editing my haphazard copy then typing it in the first place. My head was bursting. Teeth grinding. Tight muscles. That’s the cue. Time to get some air.\n\nThe sun was out, a rare summer afternoon in winter. I left my hoodie inside. I walked a fair distance, trying not to think about the deadlines, trying to enjoy the outdoors. God gifted us with good weather. But I was still jerky. I looked to the clouds, the floor, the falling leaves, but my mind often felt and sat in front of my laptop, working on the copy. I needed to breathe. I needed to be centre. To be mindful. To enjoy this moment, this moment in time, this day the the lord made, this time in the place in time-space, or is it space-time?\n\nThe stray looked on, on top of a large stone. His head tilted. Quizzical eyes darting at me.\n\n“Mind your own business”, I told him.\n\nThe stray tilted his head all the way to the other side.\n\n“I’m trying to relax”\n\nThe stray nodded.\n\n“Well, whatever… stop acting like you understand what I’m saying”\n\nThe stray rested, his front paws crossing in front, letting a silent yawn.\n\n“What’s wrong with you anyway? Why aren’t you running off or something?”\n\nThe stray let out a growling purr.\n\n“So what do you want me to do? Talk about my *problems?* My *deep dark problems?*”\n\nHe meowed yes.\n\n“Can you actually understand me?”\n\nHe meowed yes.\n\n“Like… you can understand everything I’m saying? Everything I’m actually saying?”\n\nYes. With a slight nod.\n\nI talked to him about my deadlines, the stray absorbed, nodding here and there and letting out a meow for approval and that growling purr when he was bored. After an hour or so I ran out of things to talk about. My mind was empty, clear as crystal. After a bit of meows and a purr he walked toward another bush. I asked if we could do it again the next day the stray answered a long drawn out meow, something like “Yeah, whatever”.\n\nI stepped inside, through on my hoodie and edited the rest of my copy. After a bit of work I was done. I submitted the copy in an e-mail, then started looking at cat memes. With every cat picture I saw, the memory of the stray would flash before me. His meows, his growl. His white and brown coat. His eyes. The more I replayed our conversation the more questions I had, the more things I wanted to say. This wasn’t the first time I had a bad case of staircase wit or staircase topics but this time I was limited. I couldn’t call him. I couldn’t text him. There wasn’t — to my knowledge — a Cat version of e-mail too. I had to wait for the next day.\n\nDuring dinner I talked less than usual. When asked I said that I was still thinking of work and stuffed my mouth with food. They talked about something. I nodded. I cleared my plate, washed every plate near the sink and thank mom for the food. Worked out earlier than usual. I barely got a sweat running before I jumped into bed. I ran some questions for stray — silly things, serious things — for the next day. In the dark, I decided to name stray. Katze seemed to be the best name for stray. Something foreign yet common. Something close but far. Katze is German for “Cat”, something I stumbled on when I was messing around on Google translate. I threw a whole bunch of words but Katze is the only one I remember. Yes, I am a cat person but I’m a curious one too. I have never owned a cat — my mom hates them — so all my love for felines is from afar. The school cat was always some what stray, though she had a collar and a name. I loved her, the first time I have ever loved anything that wasn’t human. With SC it made sense, I loved her. Then she died.\n\nI woke up earlier than my alarm, my cold toes woke me up. My room was dark, lit by the eerie morning light, six on the clock. The carpet was ice cold, like wet ice. I change out my PJs, wore longs, the thermal ones I got from my aunt and a random shirt and sweater. I switched on my laptop, read through e-mails, nothing new. Looked over my projects, three still active due in a couple days. Opened all the docs, reading through all I did the days before. I choose to continue with the article for a tech company, 500 words done, the post is simple enough.\n\nMy alarm rang. I switched it off and headed down outside. My heart started racing halfway out the room. I ran back into my room, pressed ctrl+S, then headed out again still a bit shaky. In the kitchen I stole a bite; bread, jam, peanut butter. The sun was already rising. *Maybe Katze is out already?*\n\nKatze stretched in the sun rectangle then balled. I was temped to pet him, but his eye stopped me. I sat in silence, only movie to get comfortable. The air picked up a little, rising then standing still. I tried to fined something to say, everything from the night before vanished without a trace. A thick fog clouded my current thoughts too. Bored, Katze tried keeping his head up, then the sun hit him, his ball got smaller and tighter. He looked at me. I looked back. He closed his eyes. Fast asleep.\n\nJust like the day before, when I got up Katze left. This time I was quite. Katze also left slower, strolling into the bushes. I got back to my desk. I typed and typed. Backspaced almost everything, then typed again. The fog was still heavy; ideas, words and grammar unrecognisable in muck. I saved what I did. 1000 words survived but a few of them will be dead. More than a few. I opened up solitaire. Click. Click. Click. I closed solitaire mid-game. Out my window, Katze was pacing back and forth by some flower pots. His head low, stomping on the floor almost. I wonder what he was thinking about. What struggles was he going through? What was he punishing himself for? I saw a meme were a cat ran up to her owner after some of her food was eaten by another pet. She was so angry! Katze was not that angry, though.\n\nThat afternoon told Katze about SC. I told him about how we met and how it all ended. Katze listened. Really listened. His ears were pointed at the start, all the fun parts of our relationship. His ears drooped, eyes tearing up when I talked about the end. I was tearing up too. I was something about Katze, how he reacted — his eyes, his posture, his ears — that hit me. SC flashed next to Katze, then SC vanished leaving her cries for me. Katze started shivering, letting out cold long cries. Katze’s cry. SC’s cry. Both singing to me, burning my ears.\n\n“I don’t know if you can understand me”, I began, “But I can’t take care of you. I can’t…”\n\nKatze let out a sad meow.\n\n“My mom hates cats… above that, I can’t feed you… you know. Food is expensive for humans, let alone a cat.”\n\nI know, Katze meowed.\n\n“I know you wanted me to adopt you… I know you chose that place near me to get closer to me…” — tears ran down my face — “I mean I have a hard time taking care of my self… I still live with my parents. I don’t make enough to live off of too. I’m just still a kid. I’m sorry…”\n\nKatze walked over to me. I bent over picked him up and hugged him. I brought him to my chest. He purred — sweet, soft — right next to my ear. As I cried, Katze rubbed his face on wet cheek, saying “It’s okay”. I sat down in the dirt and continued to hold him.\n\n“I think you should leave… I think its for the best” I whispered. Katze blinked slowly, then struggled out my hands. He walked down the driveway, skipped on the flower bed and again on the wall. He looked back, called to me one last time then jumped over the wall. He was gone.\n\nI stepped inside. Washed my face. Headed to the kitchen. Toasted some bread. Slide butter over the warm toast, watching the butter ooze into a liquid. I ate the sandwich, ripping it into bite sizes before throwing them in my mouth. I then sat at my desk. Backspace. Everything. Start afresh.\n\n\n___\n\nTwitter: @TJohnShumba", "timestamp": 1657136973, "digest": "-0phPHgzAhXJOyUb-iOV9u-P0N3vqZQl-JsSVPcLxwM", "contributor": "0x2f2ceDd2999AaeE4A66dEf417A01F31AcbE67944"}

{"id": "dooKunUHZcCS0MYpb9TJtAs_P9F6nRybHziyyJUZpsI", "title": "Le Chemin à Parcourir en 2019", "body": "*Initialement publié en anglais par StarkWare le 12 Décembre, 2018*\n\n2019 est à nos portes, et nous voulions partager nos projets pour l'année à venir.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VDFWKpL4aiA-6mZrwCU-o.png?height=2099&width=1400)\n\n![Photo par NordWood Themes sur Unsplash](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PrxStNe7uynpmSLpLZXKb.png?height=2099&width=1400)\n\nTout d'abord, un rapide récapitulatif. 2018 a été une grande année pour nous. Nous nous sommes constitués en société il y a un an avec l'intention d'apporter les avantages du système de preuve STARK aux blockchains. Notre entreprise s'est développée et compte désormais vingt personnes. Nous avons un mélange puissant de talents à la fois en mathématiques et en ingénierie, ainsi qu'une équipe agile chargé du produit et du marketing.\n\nSur le plan technologique, notre équipe d'ingénieurs a construit un impressionnant software à partir de zéro. Nous avons déjà amélioré les performances du prover et du verifier, ainsi que la taille de la preuve, d'au moins un ordre de grandeur (et ce n'est pas fini). Ces réalisations nous ont permis de [démontrer récemment](https://twitter.com/StarkWareLtd/status/1054712104731721728) un système de preuve STARK complet fonctionnant sur WASM ( !) dans un navigateur ( !!) sur un smartphone ( !!). Une première, pour un système de preuve transparent.\n\nNous avons levé 36 millions de dollars en [deux tours](https://twitter.com/StarkWareLtd/status/1056793140831633410) de financement. Nous n'avons pas réalisé d'ICO - cette voie n'avait pas de sens pour nous. Nous avons également reçu un généreux [grant de la Fondation Ethereum](https://twitter.com/StarkWareLtd/status/1018685807148879873) l'été dernier - la plus importante qu'elle ait accordée à ce jour.\n\nSTARKs améliorera profondément deux des problèmes les plus urgents des blockchains permissionless : la scalabilité et la confidentialité (privacy). Nous avons décidé que notre alpha devait se concentrer sur la scalabilité. La confidentialité viendra en second lieu. Nous travaillons dur sur notre alpha, que nous avons l'intention de publier dans quelques mois.\n\nNotre approche de la scalabilité est simple : déplacer les calculs et le stockage off-chain. Nous construirons un service off-chain qui générera des preuves STARK attestant de l'intégrité de ces calculs. La preuve sera ensuite replacée on-chain, permettant ainsi à toute partie intéressée de la valider. La même infrastructure de blockchain trustless (”sans confiance”) est dotée d'une échelle exponentiellement plus grande en permettant à la majeure partie du travail de calcul d'être effectuée off-chain, tout en maintenant l'intégrité du calcul et sans hypothèses de confiance.\n\nDans un premier temps, nous allons nous concentrer sur la scalabilité d'une application particulière: les DEXs fonctionnant sur la Machine Virtuelle Ethereum. Pourquoi les DEXs ? Le trading constitue une part importante de l'activité sur Ethereum, et les DEXs offrent aux traders la possibilité importante de conserver la garde (custody) de leurs crypto-actifs, éliminant ainsi le risque de contrepartie. Mais les DEXs souffrent beaucoup du manque de scalabilité : cela les limite à de très faibles volumes d'échanges, et ils sont donc illiquides. C'est un sérieux handicap par rapport aux exchanges centralisés. Nous travaillons avec plusieurs partenaires dans l’univers DEX, et nous ferons des annonces prochainement.\n\nQu'avons-nous en tête après la livraison de notre DEX de scalabilité alpha ?\n\nUn effort ciblé pour apporter notre solution à de multiples acteurs du marché. Mais la conclusion d'une alpha réussie devrait être plus large que la simple scalabilité du DEX. Elle démontrera comment les STARKs peuvent favoriser la scalabilité du Layer 1, du Layer 2 et des dApps, et pourquoi les STARKs devraient être des éléments fondamentaux pour atteindre la scalabilité de la blockchain. À l'avenir, nous prévoyons d’utiliser les STARKs pour la confidentialité des blockchains.\n\nDans nos prochains articles, nous nous plongerons dans l'ingénierie de notre solution DEX scalable et dans nos projets de chain d'outils logiciels STARK - restez donc à l'écoute !\n\nNous vous souhaitons une année 2019 productive !\n\nL’Équipe StarkWare\n\n*Traduction faite par [HoVa](https://twitter.com/H0xVa).*", "timestamp": 1657137940, "digest": "SH0vNx_tJNULjJ74D5xeM-7v-QCYo2-cd0X-Kdxoy4M", "contributor": "0x568B12eBBE85521D2cd8a2C9B7a8EF3f48aa2d66"}

{"id": "Ufsg-ZHor0ZDt8QAM9N1RZkM2KuzHx-w-M5pDURgMk0", "title": "DAO Introduction & MoonDAO's Uniqueness", "body": "*Many people have heard of this notion: DAO. But what is DAO, MoonDAO introduction, and what makes MoonDAO distinguished above all. In this article, we aim to give readers a thorough introduction.*\n\n**What is DAO?**\n\nDAO is the acronym for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. A DAO is formed when a multitude of people are organized into a web3 collective in pursuit of a well-defined goal. DAOs are increasingly becoming a popular use case of blockchain technology in fundraising, finance, philanthropy, investment, asset management, acquisition of blue chip NFTs, Web 3 projects, social activism, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jSuV0G98nZgYBISmRZUu7.png?height=516&width=855)\n\nAlthough DAOs are pretty much similar to traditional companies, they differ in technology, scope, jurisdiction, management and philosophy.  For example, a DAO is decentralized--governance running on blockchain codes and trying to minimize or even abolish central authority--while a company is a centralized entity with a chain of command and subject to the various traditional laws of states on incorporation, taxation, bankruptcy, winding-up and employment, etc, which to some extent, guarantees market order, but hinders innovation.\n\nBesides, a DAO is usually global in scope and has a wider reach, whereas most companies usually tend to fall within a country’s geographical space and economy. This particular distinction is why the defunct ConstitutionDAO, for example, was able to receive $47 million in funding from 17,000 people across the globe in a stretch of six days on  Ethereum-based crypto funding platform, JuiceBox. Indeed, it achieved this feat as a DAO and not as a company in a bid to purchase an original copy of the US constitution.\n\nIn terms of its membership, crypto tokens are to DAOs what shares or stocks are to traditional companies(LLCs, C-Corps etc) . A DAO’s token pretty much operates like a company’s stock since it basically confers membership and a bundle of rights on its holders. But it has a more broader use than a company’s share as a result of the voting power it grants every member of a DAO regardless of the amount of tokens he or she can afford.\n\n**How DAOs operate**\n\nDAOs operate a bottom-up governance model on blockchain-- which is their underlying technology--for a range of purposes including security, public access to financial records, treasury management and transparency. No major changes to their structures can be effected without them being voted upon by an overwhelming majority of the investors. This is essentially because smart contracts, basically underline how DAOs work. They are rules embedded into how they are organized and they help them to function autonomously without the need for a centralized authority.\n\n**MoonDAO: an overview**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GUeHLNIuFXAyKkfBgKPST.png?height=427&width=859)\n\nAt the core of MoonDAO’s founding lies its ambition to decentralize access to space. Its roadmap includes purchasing space tickets, launching an NFT space ticket, flying to outer space aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard, establishing a colony in space, collaborating with leading space agencies and research organizations, and launching ambitious space projects. In addition, it seeks to set up its own manufacturing plant for space rockets in the near future.\n\nIt has a talent pool of seasoned contributors who are divided into different workstreams and who are eligible to receive $Mooney or DAI as compensation, salaries, reimbursements, and bonuses at the end of each working phase or period.\n\n**What makes MoonDAO different?**\n\nMoonDAO is distinguished in goal orientation, project&guild system, incentive structure,etc.\n\nTake incentive structure for example. To achieve true decentralization, MoonDAO took the road less traveled by opting for a retroactive compensation plan in respect of its contributors. This basically meant that neither the founders nor the early contributors were allocated a portion of its newly minted $Mooney.\n\nAnd MoonDAO adopts Coordinape to distribute token in a decentralized and fair way. The key-point about the distribution pattern is to exercise some discretion over the allocation of points to other contributors who are selected by a team member or contributor.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDAOs have come to represent a new model for business, finance, investment, fundraising, etc. Although they have long been around since the days of The DAO, they only recently became more popular with the success of ConstitutionDAO at fundraising and its failure at Sotheby’s.\n\nDAO is the space to watch in crypto and web 3 as more and more ambitious projects like MoonDAO continue to spring up. A DAO holds a lot of potential for impacting the world as we know it: from animal welfare to environmental protection to social justice.\n\nMoonDAO, for example, is set to become the first DAO to send humans into outer space following its successful token deployment and fundraising in January. Its ambition, in the long term, is to decentralize access to space by helping millions of people around the world to inch closer to their dream of traveling to space in a lifetime.\n\n                                                                                      ***(Author: OlaPhsix; Editor-in-chief: CarolW)***", "timestamp": 1657138137, "digest": "kczF7KcCVJYSwk2cGaKab_hwKgdthp6-JiXJVfuBmME", "contributor": "0xD806bDee5d1d2AbE42242ac06A7AdAFFE2Cf53C0"}
{"id": "bbkf2n4Jxqzb_GUHj-PCdhHaNu47DUfkLCdFlyKD-5Y", "title": "Project Journey in MoonDAO", "body": "With the increasing adoption of Web3 technology, companies with traditional top-down pyramid structures are gradually evolving into new types of organizational relationships with bottom-up DAOs. This new type of organizational relationship can greatly improve the subjective initiative of individuals, tap the multi-faceted potential of individuals, further liberate productivity and accelerate our communication efficiency.To fully understand how this relationship is built the bottom-up governance of such DAO as MoonDAO needs to be examined in contrast to how traditional LLCs operate.\n\nMoonDAO is a consortium of space enthusiasts, crypto investors and DAO builders that was formed by Pablo Moncada and Kori Rogers in November 2021. Its primary objective is to decentralize access to space by funding space travel and exploration in a Web3 way.\n\n## Advantages of DAOs (ie MOONDAO)\n\n**It offers incentives**\n\nHolding $Mooney offers such incentives as participatory governance and compensation. A unit of $Mooney equals a bundle of voting power which is required in the governance of MoonDAO, and it is the most preferred mode of payment by core contributors in its various work streams. Essentially, it can either be purchased on listing exchanges directly or recieved as vested compensation over a period of time. Most importantly, holding $Mooney directly implies that one has a stake in the affairs of MoonDAO by voting on proposals and it increases the incentive to transition from working in traditional companies to joining a DAO’s work force.\n\n$Mooney is projected to exponentially increase in value as the decentralization agenda of MoonDAO progresses which is a far greater incentive to hold than to sell it off at the current market value. There is proof that the vast majority of investors who bought $Mooney since it began trading on JuiceBox are still holding and while their tokens may not have increased significantly they have a strong conviction about its future. Finally, incentivizing MoonDAO’s core contributors with only a promise of future tokens was pretty easy because its value proposition gives it an edge over others through its potential to solve some of the major challenges in the space industry; it is also the result of MoonDAO’s retroactive compensation plan which was executed after three months of enormous undertaking which cost nearly $1 million in salaries (ie compensation) and reimbursements.\n\n**It stimulates passion**\n\nThe applicability of blockchain technology through DAOs can reduce the credit cost. Traditional enterprises have cumbersome processes to ensure the compliance of economic transactions, whereas DAOs, based on blockchain technology and web3 tools, liberates project members from the process and puts more energy into the value creation and value output of project construction.\n\nBy peer-to-peer working mode, people can have a great freedom to work, whether in space and time. It arouses the interest of team members in the project, and stimulates their initiative of work and study.\n\n**It promotes democratic mode of decision making**\n\nOf course, decentralization means a wider public participation in governance and discussion of matters. To a certain extent, it will bring about inefficiency. MoonDAO has effectively explored how to balance efficiency and democracy.\n\nWe have realized over time that having the whole community weigh in on small decisions has become a recurring bottleneck for MoonDAO. In an effort to accelerate the execution speed of our DAO, we have developed a method for allowing the DAO to trust certain individuals to work on properly scoped-out, non-perpetual, goal-based projects such that they have their own access to funds via a multi-signature wallet.\n\nThe proposal also includes rules and guidelines for how to work in a transparent and auditable way, how compensation will work for those teams, and how the community can voice their comments or concerns with the project team.\n\nWe believe that this step forward will increase the speed at which the DAO can operate, with the added benefit of increasing decentralization, autonomy and organization!\n\n## Process\n\nTherefore, we set up the MoonDAO Project. MoonDAO Projects are non-perpetual, goal-based teams that are voted to act as trusted executors on behalf of the DAO to complete a mission. Projects can apply for a budget from the community to complete their goals, and once the mission is completed the team is disbanded.\n\n### Phase 1: Preparation\n\n1. Selection of Project Direction\n\nAccording to the demand in MoonDAO of ourselves or others’ feedback, first find the sore point, and choose the direction of the project.\n\n1. Talent Aggregation\n\nWe can gather like-minded members in discord, and use our network resources in reality to invite friends together. Then form a team with a variety of talents and comprehensive abilities.\n\n1. Proposal Writing\n\nThe democracy and relative efficiency of DAO is based on Google's online documentations, online sheets and on-chain voting. After Team leads work out all materials like the timeline, OKRs and budgets of the project, it is posted in discord and all members of the community can read and give opinions. And finally summarize to form the final version of the plan file, reducing the cost of consensus\n\n1. Two Votes\n\nThere are two votes open to the whole community.\n\na. The proposal is active for a maximum of 7 days for it to reach a threshold of 30 Discord thumbs up from our DAO members.\n\nb. After meeting the threshold, the proposal will be included in that batch’s weekly snapshot for approval by the DAO and the DAO can vote on the snapshot for it to be passed.\n\n### Phase 2:   Implementation\n\n1. Guiding teams\n\nAs the team steward, there are two core aspects to consider:\n\na) Positioning and task assignment of team members. After planning the roles required for the project, community members are naturally a talent pool for every project.\n\nb) Formulate rules and regulations of penalties and rewards to staff rules to follow and create a good management system.\n\n1. Control the Progress\n\nFollow the schedule of timelines and planning matters on the proposal. And by using discord and google doc, the team can easily make meeting agenda, organize a meeting and report timely project progress to the whole community.\n\n1. Public informed\n\nProjects work transparently in the DAO such that anyone in the DAO can audit the work that is being done, and can weigh in if they have questions, comments, or concerns. They will also receive access to the Notion where they can archive documents, meeting notes, etc…\n\n1. Compensation\n\na) Do project stewards receive any compensation?\n\nProject stewards will be compensated with a $5,000 monthly salary paid in Dai. This salary is only meant to cover living expenses, and is only a portion of the full compensation that may come from Coordinape while they’re leading a project.\n\nSteward pay will be consistent for each project, with a maximum of two leaders per project. If someone is already a leader in a project, they may lead a second project, but they would not receive pay from multiple projects.\n\nb) How do other project members get paid?\n\nCompensation for members on a project will not be included in the budget. Rather, every pay period the DAO will vote for the proportion of $MOONEY tokens that are distributed to each project. Then, inside each project a Coordinape will be created to pay everyone that has helped in that project.\n\n## Thoughts & Experiences\n\nHere are some experiences some project leaders and participants have and summarize in the process of the project and if you want to join in this journey, you go ahead with the things above!\n\n**Hayrul Music NFT Project－Richard：**\n\nAfter proposing the idea of building KOLs and Hayrul Music NFTs, it quickly gained support from $Mooney holders in the community and quickly formed a team.\n\nIn less than a week, singer Hayrul completed the creation of the song, and the community spontaneously donated to help the production and distribution of the song, and the community's connections quickly contacted the Tencent music platform, and the release was successful. Such a rapid organization of resources to execute projects is an advantage that traditional industries do not have, as Team lead saves a lot of communication and coordination costs, and can focus on the development of ideas.\n\nMy personal experience about web3 projects construction especially for NFT projects is that enough attention, exposure and visibility are important. In order to bring enough traffic, I conceived to focus on cultivating community members, becoming KOLs, helping the project to continue to drain, and being able to exert efforts in the early, middle and late stages of the entire project, with continuous people, stories, communication and narrative.\n\n**Writing Project－CarolW：**\n\nI'm editor-in-chief from the writers guild, and I've been involved in both guild and project. In MoonDAO, the guild and project are both independent and related. Each guild also needs to do a project to apply for a project to apply for a salary incentive or funding reimbursement.\n\nThe Mirror project is just initiated by the internal discussion of the risks guild in discord - we strongly felt the urgency of the mirror sub-domain name, and it was necessary to build the mirror as a communication base for the project to promote the brand and project ideas. So after planning the general process, writers who were willing to write articles were openly recruited to participate in the creation. Write proposals (including time planning, task division, etc.) and submit them to the community for voting. After the project proposal is adopted, it will be carried out step by step according to the time point, and the division of labor will be cooperated.\n\nCompared to the working mode of traditional companies, I have new experience in the process of organizing and participating in DAO projects.\n\nFirst of all, it is small and efficient. The project setting time period is no more than one month, and even long-term projects need to be applied for in stages. On the one hand, this is conducive to urging the project to set short-term goals, carry out efficiently in a limited time, and complete small tasks in a short period of time, rather than the traditional company's project settings for a long time, resulting in staff procrastination; on the other hand, MoonDAO's support for small projects is conducive to rapidly promoting the development of matters and efficiently promoting DAO to maturity step by step.\n\nThen there is enough openness and transparency. The initiation of the project, the mid-term work discussion, the phase meeting are fully open and transparent in discord, and the details of the project expenditures for which the funds have been requested will be submitted for review. This greatly reflects the intention of the DAO to decentralize.\n\n***(Author: CarolW Richard; Editor-in-chief: CarolW)***\n\n```\n                                                                 \n```", "timestamp": 1657138201, "digest": "B0G2GCCF4-Tqkya0bI38rO4zxJurIM7Lu__cvnCJlbA", "contributor": "0xD806bDee5d1d2AbE42242ac06A7AdAFFE2Cf53C0"}
{"id": "XhGvmFCDDx0HuBBZtyjtGfwulIwSQ_AEOKUbwi-QK84", "title": "How MoonDAO Implemented Its Retroactive Compensation Plan", "body": "*MoonDAO is on course to becoming the first DAO to send humans into outer space and the first of its kind in space research and exploration. It is a fast growing community of token holders, core contributors and space enthusiasts. Its mission, put simply, is to decentralize access to space by fostering  partnerships with space agencies, academic researchers, engineers etc.* \n\n*In this article, its compensation and incentive system is explained with a view to answering the question of how it implements its payroll policies as a DAO.*\n\nSince founding in November of 2021, MoonDAO has been intentional about its compensation and incentive structure in a bid to ensure that its core contributors are adequately compensated for their time and efforts.  The need to make adequate compensation a cardinal principle  of its reward system  informed its decision to choose a  retroactive compensation plan over the allocation of pre-launch tokens and it was also the basis for its deployment of Coordinape for verification of contributors and the allocation of points. \n\n**Discovering Coordinape**\n\nFirst, what is Coordinape and why was it adopted by MoonDAO?\n\nCoordinape is a dapp that is designed to enable DAOs to implement a payroll system on the basis of individual contribution to a DAO project and a web 3 tool that integrates seamlessly with crypto wallets. \n\nMoonDAO finally resorted to using Coordinape after it weighed the pros and cons of other dapps that serve a similar purpose. Its choice of Coordinape was informed by its value proposition which aligns with the core values professed by it. Besides, Coordianpe’s ability to make the distribution of rewards flexible and transparent made it the preferred choice. \n\n**What problem does Coordinape solve?** \n\nDAOs often have to grapple with the question of how to pay contributors for their roles at the onset as it’s a complex situation to elect to doll out salaries without first creating work streams that justify such mode of payment. Nevertheless, there must be some form of reward for those who expend time and energy on a DAO project or it would be very unrealistic to incentivize people to take up roles and responsibilities in a DAO. \n\nMoreover, there is also the question of how transparent and corruption-free the system of reward and compensation could be when a percentage of the community’s treasury is salted away for the purpose of paying for the amount of effort that is poured into getting a DAO off the ground or pursuing its goals. \n\nUsing Coordinape, however,  has proven to be the best fix for the problem of how to implement a payment regime that is based on the ability of one contributor to verify or legitimize the claim of another in a distributed or recurring pattern. It also serves as a proof of how to decentralize the mode of payment so that no individual is able to control or influence how the distribution is done. \n\n**MoonDAO’s Retroactive Governance Token Distribution**\n\nMoonDAO is a large community of $Mooney holders which include its contributors and it operates in a truly decentralized fashion by democratizing the process of decision making. $Mooney as a utility token is majorly deployed for snapshot votes.  \n\nMoonDAO’s first compensation was retroactive in that it dated back to the 24th of November which was the official date for the commencement of its phase 1. Phase 1 is defined as the work involved in going from 0 to 1 with MoonDAO.  It saw the creation of the vision, goals, mission and values; the marketing of the project,  the deployment of  juicebox; the  launching of the token and the eventual $8.3 million dollar raise . It is the  pay period from November 24th, 2021 through January 17th 2022.\n\nMoonDAO’s governance token distribution was effectively implemented using coordinape which allowed every contributor to receive a certain number of points through their wallet addresses. The key-point about the distribution pattern is to exercise some discretion over the allocation of points to other contributors who are selected by a team member or contributor. \n\nThe allocation is in Coordinape GIVE tokens which can as well represent the number of points received. For example, X is allocated 200 points to be shared among the 20 contributors/team members he selected from the database. If X decides to doll out 10 points to them, each will receive 10 GIVE token from X as points earned. \n\nA more detailed explanation using Alesha as case study will look like this: \n\n* Alesha receives 50 GIVE tokens from the community for her contributions.\n* Once the allocation period ends, her GIVE tokens will be automatically converted to GET tokens.\n* The total allocation across the whole DAO is 1,000 GET tokens.\n* The DAO’s seasonal budget is 25,000 DAI.\n* Alesha’s 50 GET Tokens are 5% of the available 1,000 GET tokens, so she is sent 5% of the DAO’s total budget (5% of 25,000 DAI = 1,250 DAI.)\n\nAt the end of the voting period, the DAO sends Alesha 1,250 USDC for her contributions during phase 1 provided that no condition like vesting applies to the allocation. \n\n**The Problem With Using Coordinape**\n\nCoordinape is an excellent DAO tool based on its design and specification. However, MoonDAO’s first token allocation, which is more of an acid test, probes deeper into how the bar of equitable distribution of tokens can be raised to address the problem of underpayment or the lack of commensurate pay in the future. Since coordinape allows every user to select a team worthy of compensation  from the available database, there is a high tendency to leave out contributors who do not share the same work stream with others. \n\nCritics have recently explained how token allocation on coordinape can lead to popularity contests whereby the amounts of tokens or points earned by an individual or a group of people relate to their  fame or popularity rating in the DAO. The situation puts lesser known contributors at the risk of underpayment and may significantly affect the rating or popularity of Coordinape among DAO users.\n\n**MoonDAO’s strategies for improvement**\n\nAs it currently stands, MoonDAO’s rating of Coordinape lies between 5 and 6 on a scale of 1-10. But there is a general consensus in favour of scaling up the process of allocating tokens to deserving contributors and providing . The first step it has taken in optimizing the equitable allocation of tokens on Coordinape and reducing the risk of underpayment is creating multiple streams of incentives which include bounties, grants, salaries, reimbursements etc. \n\nMoreover, work streams in MoonDAO are now well-structured and organised, and the levels of engagements in various streams have significantly improved since its policy of progressive decentralization began to gain traction. MoonDAO is committed over the long term to increasing the visibility of its contributors by incentivizing them to create proposals and build their own team. Consequently, this is expected to make MoonDAO more inclusive and decentralized in the future when utilizing Coordinape will include a check on the risk of paying contributors less than they deserve. \n\n***(Author: OlaPhsix; Editor-in-chief: CarolW)***", "timestamp": 1657138223, "digest": "B9SSh8B3s2P1SqPeRjz9qLQXg2bJ6swSWXs0GC3oBiQ", "contributor": "0xD806bDee5d1d2AbE42242ac06A7AdAFFE2Cf53C0"}

As a tech investor, [Nisa Amoils](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nisaamoils/) is one of those VCs in search of new investment opportunities in cutting-edge technology. Her mission is to help mitigate the longstanding lack of funding invested in female and minority founders that affects both investors and entrepreneurs.\n\nAmoils works as the managing partner of [A100x Ventures](https://angel.co/v/login?after_sign_in=/v/rfund/a100x/fundraising), a venture fund that invests in blockchain/AI-enabled businesses. To date, the fund has invested in crypto, defi, nft, and blockchain, and their mission is to solve real world problems with technology and impact. We recently chatted with her to discuss her career journey in Web3, and her passion to get more women in the field.\n\n**How did you get your start in Web3?**\n\nI have been investing exclusively in Web3 for six years, and I have been a venture capitalist for 11 years. I’m a securities lawyer too. I also hosted a show called the “[Digital Asset Report](https://fintech.tv/show/digital-asset-report/)” and wrote for Forbes’ crypto[ and blockchain column](https://www.forbes.com/crypto-blockchain/?sh=68f198592b6e).\n\n**How would you explain your industry and the work you do in a quick elevator pitch?**\n\nAt [A100x Ventures](https://angel.co/v/login?after_sign_in=/v/rfund/a100x/fundraising), we invest in early stage blockchain-enabled companies. We also try to invest in diversity and impact. I would describe Web3 as the internet of trust or value and the next evolution of the internet where participants can own a piece of it instead of just being the product. As a venture capitalist, I’m investing in Web3 companies.\n\n**What’s the secret to your success in Web3?**\n\nWe have more than 10 unicorns and multiple exits so it’s essential that we help founders scale and give them a unique value add. We avoid purely speculative crypto plays and give our investors exposure to blockchain technology while avoiding regulatory risk and volatility.\n\n**Why is it important for women to join Web3 and the metaverse right now?**\n\nIt’s important for women to join Web3 because we can’t build the next generation of technology without half of the population, and all the wealth goes to men.\n\n**What’s your greatest achievement so far in the Web3 space?**\n\nMy greatest achievement so far has been Investing early in [Mythical Games Inc.](https://mythicalgames.com/), which are metaverse/NFT unicorns. Another achievement I am proud of is getting more women into the space.\n\n**What’s one misconception that you want to debunk about your industry?**\n\nThere’s a common misconception that crypto is already regulated, but it couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\n**What’s one example of how you and/or your organization is moving the equality needle — at work or in life?**\n\nWe are moving the equality needle forward by connecting funds and minority-owned business owners and allowing them to join our fund at much lower costs. I also wrote a book in 2018 called [“WTF Is Happening: Women Tech Founders on the Rise”](https://www.amazon.com/WTF-Happening-Women-Tech-Founders/dp/1544502893) about the benefits of investing in diversity in blockchain and addressing the lack of funding — 2% — that goes to minorities.

With time, I felt more comfortable joining conversations and even grew my followers to 40K on Clubhouse and more than 26K on Twitter, which enabled me to teach and influence people on the subject by hosting my own Web3-oriented Clubhouse rooms and Twitter Spaces.” **— Tal Navaro, Founder of Social Lady**\n\n*Photo by *[*John Schnobrich*](https://unsplash.com/@johnschno?utm_source=unsplash\\&utm_medium=referral\\&utm_content=creditCopyText)\n", "timestamp": 1657138604, "digest": "6TRk67HcjjnTpJrbPsGZwQu8jNgxfoy8h6TMeo_FaF0", "contributor": "0x1f77f67Add1C7899c9C2fD8751f69B4830230c43"}
{"id": "CoQEKZAyT0M1buufsP5chQ5hpK6KLopRzVDqy7c4008", "title": "Web3/Metaverse quick hits #3", "body": "## #3 What’s good in NFT/Metaverse\n\nEdition # 3. This week we've got a Cannes Lion winner from downunder, Qatar Airways enters the metaverse, more ownership moves with IP rights and downloadable files for NFT owners, the NBA goes metaverse mobile, a few tips from me and some research I'm following... Let's do it:\n\n## Metaverse & NFT projects that stood out & why\n\n**Australian Open tennis metaverse wins Cannes Lion**\n\nAustralian Open Metaverse won the [first Cannes Lions for the NFT-Metaverse project](https://biz.crast.net/australian-open-metaverse-nxt-a-crazy-ride-for-cannes-lions-adnews/) in partnership with [Run It Wild](https://www.runitwild.io/). Bringing “a warm Australian summer vibe through the computer screen,” fans joined a Decentraland party during the tournament (a 1st for a grand slam) with an immersive journey through Melbourne Park, behind-the-scenes footage, historical matches and daily quests with PoAP badges and wearables. The [generative tennis ball art NFTs](https://ao.artball.io/) featured utility such as real match data integration, metaverse access, airdrops etc. More [here](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/05/australian-open-apes-into-tennis-nfts-and-decentraland-too/) and [here](https://medium.com/@Runitwild/building-a-unique-web3-experience-at-the-australian-open-with-run-it-wild-and-chainlink-1b07efd9d565).\n\n[https://twitter.com/crypto_invest88/status/1483744096212877317?s=20&t=joD00X1ewPa7DnY8CRsCIw](https://twitter.com/crypto_invest88/status/1483744096212877317?s=20&t=joD00X1ewPa7DnY8CRsCIw)\n\n**MY TAKE:** A great event-based activation to engage fans in new ways. Exciting utility for NFT holders, metaverse onramps with unique experiences. Worthy for me. Go Aussie!\n\n**Qatar Airways to launch NFTs & metaverse ticket purchases for flights**\n\n[Qverse](https://www.qatarairways.com/html/redirect/qverse/#/) lets passengers virtually visit and navigate the Premium Check-in area at the International Airport of Hamad (HIA). [Qatar says these experiences reflects passengers’ desire for immersive content](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-metaverse-will-empower-human-beings-declares-qatar-airways) that can empower their decision-making before buying a ticket, and are often eager to discover the aircraft they will fly. Last year, Qatar Airways [became](https://www.unlock-bc.com/news/2021-03-21/qatar-airlines-joins-emirates-and-etihad-in-trialing-iata-blockchain-enabled-travel-pass/) the first airline in the Middle East to adopt the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Blockchain Digital Passport.\n\n[https://twitter.com/qatarairways/status/1516438976055316481?s=20&t=trVtsFOuvzm_2_-8Lu7Btw](https://twitter.com/qatarairways/status/1516438976055316481?s=20&t=trVtsFOuvzm_2_-8Lu7Btw)\n\n**MY TAKE**: Even though they don’t accept crypto payments yet (Emirates plans to), Qatar could become the first web3 airline. Interesting first steps here, driven by customer insight which can often lead to first-mover advantage.\n\n**Nike’s RTFKT studio hands over files & IP rights to Clone X NFT owners**\n\nA new Era begins: 3D Files, Full Commercial Rights, It’s time to CREATE says RTFKT with these IP moves similar to the Bored Apes. “We envision a future where Clone X owners tag team with 3D artists, become Vtubers / Superstars, and [create their own wearable web3 fashion brand](https://rtfktstudios.medium.com/a-new-era-begins-the-start-of-the-avatar-economy-91f644be33be)”. Holders can download files of their [Clone X NFT](https://clonex.rtfkt.com/) in multiple metaverse-ready formats.\n\n[https://twitter.com/RTFKT/status/1544035652848738304?s=20&t=7m9AU2U89ySOUeN-Z1_z9g](https://twitter.com/RTFKT/status/1544035652848738304?s=20&t=7m9AU2U89ySOUeN-Z1_z9g)\n\n**MY TAKE:** Community is everything for new and existing brands. Empowering holders with mind blowing value and benefits ignites even further passion and enthusiasm around a brand. Doodles said at SXSW that community is the new brand and this is the first time for real digital ownership (see [my SXSW recap here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m1DI5PezU5s8vSgbyclTWNU-1V-tZTzo/view?usp=sharing).).\n\n**NBA announces geo-located mobile metaverse experience with Niantic**.\n\nNiantic (makers of Pokemon Go) are firm believers of a real-world metaverse — a digital overlay to the physical world grounded in augmented reality. They want people to [stand up, walk outside, and connect with people](https://nianticlabs.com/blog/real-world-metaverse/) and the world around them. With [NBA All-World](https://nbaallworld.com/) players can “[find, challenge and compete against today’s NBA ballers](https://venturebeat.com/2022/06/28/niantic-unveils-nba-all-world-mobile-game-for-real-world-metaverse/) in their neighborhoods, then recruit them to their team before proving themselves on the virtual court”.\n\n[https://twitter.com/nbaallworld/status/1541805902600105984?s=20&t=wb_7Yu2tZIYbhQQ8dkJmLQ](https://twitter.com/nbaallworld/status/1541805902600105984?s=20&t=wb_7Yu2tZIYbhQQ8dkJmLQ)\n\n**MY TAKE**: The location-based mobile game aspect is super interesting. I remember [Pokemon Go](https://pokemongolive.com/en/) driving thousands of people to Santa Monica Pier at midnight on a Tuesday. Imagine if NBA All-World could connect players to unlock real-life pickup games at neighbor basketball courts. I could picture the final game taking place at the Venice Beach courts in CA… and being live streamed by my mates at [BallerTV](https://www.ballertv.com/).\n\n## A few of my tips & insights\n\n**How to approach metaverse conversations with brands.**\n\nAfter a recent metaverse presentation to a big brand, I laid out my approach to these conversations — and what goes into my decks. See tweet thread below:\n\n[https://twitter.com/johnjduffield/status/1524060219525025794?s=20&t=bCMAaGv89FW7MohiHaYT_w](https://twitter.com/johnjduffield/status/1524060219525025794?s=20&t=bCMAaGv89FW7MohiHaYT_w)\n\n**How to build empathy in the metaverse — anchoring to a shared ‘place’.**\n\nCheck out [my guest post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcIt-dANvAN/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) on Mark Pollard’s [Sweathead Strategy Accelerator](https://www.instagram.com/sweathead/) on how the metaverse can fill a void and bring a sense of togetherness when we’re remote.\n\n## Research I’m following\n\n**MIT declares Metaverse: Open for business.**\n\n“If a company thinks ‘this isn’t for us,’ they are not going to survive. Every company needs to find a place in the metaverse.”. [This piece](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/06/27/1054974/metaverse-open-for-business/) outlines the uptake and opportunities associated with the metaverse by the one and only MIT.

{"id": "fFwNIbdLSsXdWL9wCPnA1LpKSkhjqo0pmZmEM4wKQ98", "title": "Diversification and Diversity in DAOs", "body": "A Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, is an entity that seeks to coordinate the actions of a large number of humans and resources around the pursuit of a very large and often improbable goal. Whether that goal is to democratize team ownership in sports (Krause House), fight climate change (KlimaDAO), fund public goods (Gitcoin DAO) or to decentralize space exploration and put a base on the Moon (MoonDAO :-), when it comes to DAOs the more ambitious the mission the better. \n\nAmbitious missions take time, and time is cruel to organizations. Most companies don’t last 50 years, while less than 20% of the 8.4 million U.S. companies are more than 25 years old. This means that any DAO aiming for society-level impact must first simply withstand the test of time. To do so, they must lay the critical groundwork that will allow seemingly inconceivable feats to be accomplished by their members 25, 50, 100, or even 1000 (yes, 1000) years in the future. This involves developing anti-fragile and [anti-capture](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ) strategies made possible by web3 technologies and focusing a significant amount of energy on managing, cultivating, and deploying a DAO’s two greatest assets: their **treasuries** and their **communities**. Surprisingly, the key to doing this can be found in a very old and boring idea.\n\n# Diversification\n\nThe value of diversification as a general concept is embedded in the world around us, even if our brains are often moths drawn to the flame of sameness (see “[affinity bias](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tracking-wonder/202006/the-bias-against-difference)”). \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UxEmtcclAKI64RWt2mi33.png?height=696&width=764)\n\nIn the world of finance, Modern Portfolio Theory tells us that a portfolio with a wide range of assets with varying degrees of risk performs better over time than an investment in a single asset. This idea won Harry Markowitz the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990, but the idea has been baked into our cultures for hundreds of years. Miguel de Cervantes allegedly coined the term “don’t put all of your eggs in one basket” in *Don Quixote* in 1605, and we see a similar sentiment in the Chinese idiom *孤注一掷 / gū zhù yī zhì*, which means to bet everything on one “throw” (MoonDAO’s large Chinese community will have to help me on the origin of this phrase).\n\nWe also see this phenomenon in nature. A gene pool with a wide variety of genes will produce a healthier population than one with a limited number of genes. A field planted with a single crop will be more susceptible to soil depletion, disease, pests, and erosion than the same soil planted with a diverse range of plants. Even the Pareto Principle – the well-observed phenomenon in which 80% of outcomes are determined by 20% of the causes – implies that you can’t just cherry pick the optimal 20%: you also need the diversity of the other 80% to get to success.\n\n# Financial diversity\n\nFinancially speaking, diversification for a DAO is low-hanging fruit, but its obviousness also means it is often overlooked or deprioritized. MoonDAO, for example, has a treasury worth around $50 million USD (as of this writing), but this is held in only five assets, all of them crypto, and the largest one is our internal governance token MOONEY. To exist long enough to achieve some of our stated goals such as launching our own spacecraft or establishing a base on the Moon we need a strategy to preserve and grow these assets over time. This might look a little different for a DAO than it would for a traditional company because a DAO has access to a wild new ecosystem of web3 diversification options that traditional companies can’t touch or won’t touch. I’ll leave the portfolio building to the experts, but a DAO seeking long term diversification could, for example:\n\n* Stake ETH or other Proof of Work tokens.\n* Yield farm on DeFi platforms.\n* Provide liquidity on Uniswap.\n* Lend directly to other DAOs.\n* Token swap with emerging DAOs.\n* Collect blue chip NFTs.\n* Commission NFT artists in exchange for a portion of royalties.\n* Allocate funds to a small YOLO degen trading team.\n* Invest in crypto index funds.\n* Invest venture capital in startups in their domain.\n* Buy land in areas that will be havens from climate change.\n* Buy a building in NYC (or anywhere).\n* Buy stocks, bonds, or other traditional financial products.\n* Earn revenue from developing products and services.\n\nThe last few on that list are there to illustrate the point that a DAO adds a new dimension to diversification by opening up crypto-native investment options on top of having access to more traditional methods. With that in mind, Modern Portfolio Theory would suggest that a DAO has a greater probability of long term investment success than a traditional company since it has a wider range of investment options, and the risk profiles of those investment options are much more variable. Similarly, since DAOs are generally more motivated by their mission than by profit, they may have a greater risk appetite or be less affected by cognitive biases such as loss aversion. So when a DAO wins big, it might win bigger than others. And as I said before, ambition is key in a DAO.\n\n# Human diversity\n\nBut let’s get to the real point of this all. Financial diversification is only one aspect of diversification for a DAO, and arguably not the most important. The most valuable resource that any DAO has is its **community**. A DAO, after all, is just a collection of human brains – those magical meaty computers that have allowed us to do impossible things like splitting apart atoms and escaping the bonds of gravity. A DAO aligns these brains toward a shared purpose, and when it comes to brains the more that you have and the better that you coordinate their activities, the more successful you will be.\n\nBut isn’t it more efficient if we all just think the same way? It might be more efficient, but you will never generate radically genius ideas that way. To get to the 20% that produces 80% of the results, to cross pollinate different forms of intelligence in ways that create ideas that no single person could have come up with alone, you need to bring together a set of minds and human experiences that is as diverse as possible. A growing body of research – from [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2018/07/the-other-diversity-dividend) to [Forbes](https://images.forbes.com/forbesinsights/StudyPDFs/Innovation_Through_Diversity.pdf) – suggests that greater diversity in the workforce has a very strong correlation to both financial success and the innovation that such success depends on.\n\nBut as good as diversity is for your business, it’s even better for your soul. Interacting with people who are different from you and who may challenge your way of thinking makes you think more deeply about who you are, what you believe, why you believe it, how you perceive the world, and how others might perceive it differently. Our minds are extremely powerful, but they are riddled with unconscious cognitive biases. Regularly digesting a diversity of viewpoints creates a healthy mental diet that makes us aware of these biases and allows us to be even more valuable contributors to the communities we are a part of. As NASA eloquently puts it in their [Policy Statement on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2022_administrator_policy_statement_on_deia_at_nasa_tagged.pdf): \n\n> *Our astronauts have taught us about the “Overview Effect” – a cognitive shift in awareness achieved through a transcendent perspective in space – which helps us understand that all human beings are connected by the commonality of our existence and our interdependencies on a small and fragile planet; therefore, the success and wellness of our species and planet depend on the equity, inclusion, and access accorded to the full diversity of all people on our Earth.* \n\n# New trajectories\n\nUnfortunately DAOs and web3 in general have a long way to go in embracing diversity and battling racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, ableism, and other anti-human behaviors that plague both the tech world and society at large. The inhabitants of web3 have a generational opportunity to demonstrate a different path that will create both better businesses and better humans, but to do so we must invest in building that path, and building it early.\n\nAt MoonDAO, our mission is to decentralize access to space and bring it within reach of as many people as possible. To do so, it is critical that our DAO not only reflects the best minds of web3 and the best minds of science, but also the incredible diversity of the planet we call home and claim to represent. There are a variety of things we can do as DAOs to create an environment that nurtures diversity, equity, and inclusion and ensures the long-term health and stability of our community.\n\n* Establish a constitution or other social contract that clearly defines both the purpose of the DAO and its core values, and then measure every action against that purpose and those values. At MoonDAO we have a constitution project that is working on developing just such a document, with a team specifically focused on our mission and values.\n* Think beyond compensation when it comes to incentives. Compensation is one of the least important drivers of worker happiness. [Culture, values, and leadership quality](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/employee-satisfaction-drivers/#:\\~:text=There%20are%20three%20main%20drivers,is%20the%20third%20strongest%20predictor%2C) are much more important.\n* Decentralize leadership and execution by empowering DAO members to start and manage projects on their own. Assume positive intent and positive outcomes until proven otherwise, and provide support and advancement opportunities to new leaders who take initiative.\n* Invest in community managers. These are unsung heroes who have emotional intelligence and people skills that can unlock a huge amount of value for a DAO.\n* Encourage dissent. At a bare minimum, do not silence dissenting voices.\n* Specifically ensure that groups that have been historically marginalized or exploited in wider society – women, people of color, indigenous people, LGBTQ+ communities, and many others – have a true seat at the table of power within the DAO. This involves diversifying traditional centers of power in a DAO like the multisig, system admin rights, or Discord roles, as well as looking at things like pay equity and promotion opportunities that have historically been imbalanced for these groups.\n* Embrace, support, and empower a diversity of language groups and find ways to work asynchronously to account for our round planet and its many time zones. Our large Chinese community within MoonDAO has helped us build this thinking into our culture, but it is still a big challenge to overcome language and geographic barriers.\n* Attract both experts and amateurs, and break down barriers between them. We would love to see world class aerospace engineers collaborating and interacting with young space enthusiasts around the world, because these will be the scientists of the future (the ones that we hope will build our Moon base).\n* Have a zero tolerance policy for harassment, hate speech, bullying, spamming, or other gross human behaviors. We are all adults and we know these things are wrong. To say otherwise or call it “canceling” is gaslighting bullshit.\n* Find ways to have fun together and connect as humans. Maybe we will see you at our launch party when we send our first explorers into space in July.\n\n# The early bird gets the wormhole\n\nAt the beginning of time, the most important things happened earliest and defined the future shape of our 13.8 billion year old universe. Quarks and electrons formed protons and neutrons in a few millionths of a second, nuclei were formed within minutes, and a mere 380,000 years later electrons began orbiting nuclei and formed the atoms we know today. \n\nThe same is true in the genesis of all things. Early actions create patterns that endure. The right soil, light, and nutrients early on creates a healthy plant. Early investments create the majority of long term gains. So even though it is extremely important for DAOs to understand and invest in the diversity of their finances and communities, it is even more important to do so *early*. This is true of both individual DAOs like MoonDAO and the ecosystem of DAOs in general. We are in the midst of an early explosion of growth, and we will be shaped by the choices we make during this exhilarating, heady moment of youth. Let’s make sure this wormhole to a different way of living stays open for our future selves by investing in the right things early.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1657139897, "digest": "MU-22eMyIiu9IUfqK2UsCQlWC6bbtLsMawAXuSdFVcw", "contributor": "0xD806bDee5d1d2AbE42242ac06A7AdAFFE2Cf53C0"}
{"id": "oOsU4rnXUH3PCFW9TuSq8ihzgysmpfiATzNLN3ljoWo", "title": "DAO Introduction & MoonDAO's Uniqueness", "body": "*Many people have heard of this notion: DAO. But what is DAO, MoonDAO introduction, and what makes MoonDAO distinguished above all. In this article, we aim to give readers a thorough introduction.*\n\n**What is DAO?**\n\nDAO is the acronym for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. A DAO is formed when a multitude of people are organized into a web3 collective in pursuit of a well-defined goal. DAOs are increasingly becoming a popular use case of blockchain technology in fundraising, finance, philanthropy, investment, asset management, acquisition of blue chip NFTs, Web 3 projects, social activism, etc.\n\nAlthough DAOs are pretty much similar to traditional companies, they differ in technology, scope, jurisdiction, management and philosophy.  For example, a DAO is decentralized--governance running on blockchain codes and trying to minimize or even abolish central authority--while a company is a centralized entity with a chain of command and subject to the various traditional laws of states on incorporation, taxation, bankruptcy, winding-up and employment, etc, which to some extent, guarantees market order, but hinders innovation.\n\nBesides, a DAO is usually global in scope and has a wider reach, whereas most companies usually tend to fall within a country’s geographical space and economy. This particular distinction is why the defunct ConstitutionDAO, for example, was able to receive $47 million in funding from 17,000 people across the globe in a stretch of six days on  Ethereum-based crypto funding platform, JuiceBox. Indeed, it achieved this feat as a DAO and not as a company in a bid to purchase an original copy of the US constitution.\n\nIn terms of its membership, crypto tokens are to DAOs what shares or stocks are to traditional companies(LLCs, C-Corps etc) . A DAO’s token pretty much operates like a company’s stock since it basically confers membership and a bundle of rights on its holders. But it has a more broader use than a company’s share as a result of the voting power it grants every member of a DAO regardless of the amount of tokens he or she can afford.\n\n**How DAOs operate**\n\nDAOs operate a bottom-up governance model on blockchain-- which is their underlying technology--for a range of purposes including security, public access to financial records, treasury management and transparency. No major changes to their structures can be effected without them being voted upon by an overwhelming majority of the investors. This is essentially because smart contracts, basically underline how DAOs work. They are rules embedded into how they are organized and they help them to function autonomously without the need for a centralized authority.\n\n**MoonDAO: an overview**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GUeHLNIuFXAyKkfBgKPST.png?height=427&width=859)\n\nAt the core of MoonDAO’s founding lies its ambition to decentralize access to space. Its roadmap includes purchasing space tickets, launching an NFT space ticket, flying to outer space aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard, establishing a colony in space, collaborating with leading space agencies and research organizations, and launching ambitious space projects. In addition, it seeks to set up its own manufacturing plant for space rockets in the near future.\n\nIt has a talent pool of seasoned contributors who are divided into different workstreams and who are eligible to receive $Mooney or DAI as compensation, salaries, reimbursements, and bonuses at the end of each working phase or period.\n\n**What makes MoonDAO different?**\n\nMoonDAO is distinguished in goal orientation, project&guild system, incentive structure,etc.\n\nTake incentive structure for example. To achieve true decentralization, MoonDAO took the road less traveled by opting for a retroactive compensation plan in respect of its contributors. This basically meant that neither the founders nor the early contributors were allocated a portion of its newly minted $Mooney.\n\nAnd MoonDAO adopts Coordinape to distribute token in a decentralized and fair way. The key-point about the distribution pattern is to exercise some discretion over the allocation of points to other contributors who are selected by a team member or contributor.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDAOs have come to represent a new model for business, finance, investment, fundraising, etc. Although they have long been around since the days of The DAO, they only recently became more popular with the success of ConstitutionDAO at fundraising and its failure at Sotheby’s.\n\nDAO is the space to watch in crypto and web 3 as more and more ambitious projects like MoonDAO continue to spring up. A DAO holds a lot of potential for impacting the world as we know it: from animal welfare to environmental protection to social justice.\n\nMoonDAO, for example, is set to become the first DAO to send humans into outer space following its successful token deployment and fundraising in January. Its ambition, in the long term, is to decentralize access to space by helping millions of people around the world to inch closer to their dream of traveling to space in a lifetime.\n\n***(Author: OlaPhsix; Editor-in-chief: CarolW)***", "timestamp": 1657140289, "digest": "kczF7KcCVJYSwk2cGaKab_hwKgdthp6-JiXJVfuBmME", "contributor": "0xD806bDee5d1d2AbE42242ac06A7AdAFFE2Cf53C0"}

{"id": "oPiWm4HBoFXFxNORL7M1qVPSVhgATpdrwOhE4odqEGA", "title": "Diversification and Diversity in DAOs", "body": "A Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, is an entity that seeks to coordinate the actions of a large number of humans and resources around the pursuit of a very large and often improbable goal. Whether that goal is to democratize team ownership in sports (Krause House), fight climate change (KlimaDAO), fund public goods (Gitcoin DAO) or to decentralize space exploration and put a base on the Moon (MoonDAO :-), when it comes to DAOs the more ambitious the mission the better.\n\nAmbitious missions take time, and time is cruel to organizations. Most companies don’t last 50 years, while less than 20% of the 8.4 million U.S. companies are more than 25 years old. This means that any DAO aiming for society-level impact must first simply withstand the test of time. To do so, they must lay the critical groundwork that will allow seemingly inconceivable feats to be accomplished by their members 25, 50, 100, or even 1000 (yes, 1000) years in the future. This involves developing anti-fragile and [anti-capture](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ) strategies made possible by web3 technologies and focusing a significant amount of energy on managing, cultivating, and deploying a DAO’s two greatest assets: their **treasuries** and their **communities**. Surprisingly, the key to doing this can be found in a very old and boring idea.\n\n# Diversification\n\nThe value of diversification as a general concept is embedded in the world around us, even if our brains are often moths drawn to the flame of sameness (see “[affinity bias](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tracking-wonder/202006/the-bias-against-difference)”).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UxEmtcclAKI64RWt2mi33.png?height=696&width=764)\n\nIn the world of finance, Modern Portfolio Theory tells us that a portfolio with a wide range of assets with varying degrees of risk performs better over time than an investment in a single asset. This idea won Harry Markowitz the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990, but the idea has been baked into our cultures for hundreds of years. Miguel de Cervantes allegedly coined the term “don’t put all of your eggs in one basket” in *Don Quixote* in 1605, and we see a similar sentiment in the Chinese idiom *孤注一掷 / gū zhù yī zhì*, which means to bet everything on one “throw” (MoonDAO’s large Chinese community will have to help me on the origin of this phrase).\n\nWe also see this phenomenon in nature. A gene pool with a wide variety of genes will produce a healthier population than one with a limited number of genes. A field planted with a single crop will be more susceptible to soil depletion, disease, pests, and erosion than the same soil planted with a diverse range of plants. Even the Pareto Principle – the well-observed phenomenon in which 80% of outcomes are determined by 20% of the causes – implies that you can’t just cherry pick the optimal 20%: you also need the diversity of the other 80% to get to success.\n\n# Financial diversity\n\nFinancially speaking, diversification for a DAO is low-hanging fruit, but its obviousness also means it is often overlooked or deprioritized. MoonDAO, for example, has a treasury worth around $50 million USD (as of this writing), but this is held in only five assets, all of them crypto, and the largest one is our internal governance token MOONEY. To exist long enough to achieve some of our stated goals such as launching our own spacecraft or establishing a base on the Moon we need a strategy to preserve and grow these assets over time. This might look a little different for a DAO than it would for a traditional company because a DAO has access to a wild new ecosystem of web3 diversification options that traditional companies can’t touch or won’t touch. I’ll leave the portfolio building to the experts, but a DAO seeking long term diversification could, for example:\n\n* Stake ETH or other Proof of Work tokens.\n* Yield farm on DeFi platforms.\n* Provide liquidity on Uniswap.\n* Lend directly to other DAOs.\n* Token swap with emerging DAOs.\n* Collect blue chip NFTs.\n* Commission NFT artists in exchange for a portion of royalties.\n* Allocate funds to a small YOLO degen trading team.\n* Invest in crypto index funds.\n* Invest venture capital in startups in their domain.\n* Buy land in areas that will be havens from climate change.\n* Buy a building in NYC (or anywhere).\n* Buy stocks, bonds, or other traditional financial products.\n* Earn revenue from developing products and services.\n\nThe last few on that list are there to illustrate the point that a DAO adds a new dimension to diversification by opening up crypto-native investment options on top of having access to more traditional methods. With that in mind, Modern Portfolio Theory would suggest that a DAO has a greater probability of long term investment success than a traditional company since it has a wider range of investment options, and the risk profiles of those investment options are much more variable. Similarly, since DAOs are generally more motivated by their mission than by profit, they may have a greater risk appetite or be less affected by cognitive biases such as loss aversion. So when a DAO wins big, it might win bigger than others. And as I said before, ambition is key in a DAO.\n\n# Human diversity\n\nBut let’s get to the real point of this all. Financial diversification is only one aspect of diversification for a DAO, and arguably not the most important. The most valuable resource that any DAO has is its **community**. A DAO, after all, is just a collection of human brains – those magical meaty computers that have allowed us to do impossible things like splitting apart atoms and escaping the bonds of gravity. A DAO aligns these brains toward a shared purpose, and when it comes to brains the more that you have and the better that you coordinate their activities, the more successful you will be.\n\nBut isn’t it more efficient if we all just think the same way? It might be more efficient, but you will never generate radically genius ideas that way. To get to the 20% that produces 80% of the results, to cross pollinate different forms of intelligence in ways that create ideas that no single person could have come up with alone, you need to bring together a set of minds and human experiences that is as diverse as possible. A growing body of research – from [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2018/07/the-other-diversity-dividend) to [Forbes](https://images.forbes.com/forbesinsights/StudyPDFs/Innovation_Through_Diversity.pdf) – suggests that greater diversity in the workforce has a very strong correlation to both financial success and the innovation that such success depends on.\n\nBut as good as diversity is for your business, it’s even better for your soul. Interacting with people who are different from you and who may challenge your way of thinking makes you think more deeply about who you are, what you believe, why you believe it, how you perceive the world, and how others might perceive it differently. Our minds are extremely powerful, but they are riddled with unconscious cognitive biases. Regularly digesting a diversity of viewpoints creates a healthy mental diet that makes us aware of these biases and allows us to be even more valuable contributors to the communities we are a part of. As NASA eloquently puts it in their [Policy Statement on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2022_administrator_policy_statement_on_deia_at_nasa_tagged.pdf):\n\n> *Our astronauts have taught us about the “Overview Effect” – a cognitive shift in awareness achieved through a transcendent perspective in space – which helps us understand that all human beings are connected by the commonality of our existence and our interdependencies on a small and fragile planet; therefore, the success and wellness of our species and planet depend on the equity, inclusion, and access accorded to the full diversity of all people on our Earth.*\n\n# New trajectories\n\nUnfortunately DAOs and web3 in general have a long way to go in embracing diversity and battling racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, ableism, and other anti-human behaviors that plague both the tech world and society at large. The inhabitants of web3 have a generational opportunity to demonstrate a different path that will create both better businesses and better humans, but to do so we must invest in building that path, and building it early.\n\nAt MoonDAO, our mission is to decentralize access to space and bring it within reach of as many people as possible. To do so, it is critical that our DAO not only reflects the best minds of web3 and the best minds of science, but also the incredible diversity of the planet we call home and claim to represent. There are a variety of things we can do as DAOs to create an environment that nurtures diversity, equity, and inclusion and ensures the long-term health and stability of our community.\n\n* Establish a constitution or other social contract that clearly defines both the purpose of the DAO and its core values, and then measure every action against that purpose and those values. At MoonDAO we have a constitution project that is working on developing just such a document, with a team specifically focused on our mission and values.\n* Think beyond compensation when it comes to incentives. Compensation is one of the least important drivers of worker happiness. [Culture, values, and leadership quality](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/employee-satisfaction-drivers/#:\\~:text=There%20are%20three%20main%20drivers,is%20the%20third%20strongest%20predictor%2C) are much more important.\n* Decentralize leadership and execution by empowering DAO members to start and manage projects on their own. Assume positive intent and positive outcomes until proven otherwise, and provide support and advancement opportunities to new leaders who take initiative.\n* Invest in community managers. These are unsung heroes who have emotional intelligence and people skills that can unlock a huge amount of value for a DAO.\n* Encourage dissent. At a bare minimum, do not silence dissenting voices.\n* Specifically ensure that groups that have been historically marginalized or exploited in wider society – women, people of color, indigenous people, LGBTQ+ communities, and many others – have a true seat at the table of power within the DAO. This involves diversifying traditional centers of power in a DAO like the multisig, system admin rights, or Discord roles, as well as looking at things like pay equity and promotion opportunities that have historically been imbalanced for these groups.\n* Embrace, support, and empower a diversity of language groups and find ways to work asynchronously to account for our round planet and its many time zones. Our large Chinese community within MoonDAO has helped us build this thinking into our culture, but it is still a big challenge to overcome language and geographic barriers.\n* Attract both experts and amateurs, and break down barriers between them. We would love to see world class aerospace engineers collaborating and interacting with young space enthusiasts around the world, because these will be the scientists of the future (the ones that we hope will build our Moon base).\n* Have a zero tolerance policy for harassment, hate speech, bullying, spamming, or other gross human behaviors. We are all adults and we know these things are wrong. To say otherwise or call it “canceling” is gaslighting bullshit.\n* Find ways to have fun together and connect as humans. Maybe we will see you at our launch party when we send our first explorers into space in July.\n\n# The early bird gets the wormhole\n\nAt the beginning of time, the most important things happened earliest and defined the future shape of our 13.8 billion year old universe. Quarks and electrons formed protons and neutrons in a few millionths of a second, nuclei were formed within minutes, and a mere 380,000 years later electrons began orbiting nuclei and formed the atoms we know today.\n\nThe same is true in the genesis of all things. Early actions create patterns that endure. The right soil, light, and nutrients early on creates a healthy plant. Early investments create the majority of long term gains. So even though it is extremely important for DAOs to understand and invest in the diversity of their finances and communities, it is even more important to do so *early*. This is true of both individual DAOs like MoonDAO and the ecosystem of DAOs in general. We are in the midst of an early explosion of growth, and we will be shaped by the choices we make during this exhilarating, heady moment of youth. Let’s make sure this wormhole to a different way of living stays open for our future selves by investing in the right things early.\n\n***(Author: zeroindex; Editor-in-chief: CarolW)***", "timestamp": 1657140332, "digest": "MU-22eMyIiu9IUfqK2UsCQlWC6bbtLsMawAXuSdFVcw", "contributor": "0xD806bDee5d1d2AbE42242ac06A7AdAFFE2Cf53C0"}

The most common is that it’s an audio file that holds the music you wish to purchase (or have purchased), which could be a single, an album or a playlist. Then there are “visualizations” of said music, including still images or videos, and often accompany an audio file.\n\n## Why are Fans Lining up to Buy Music NFTs?\n\nOne question I’ve heard is, “Why would anyone spend money on an NFT that supports music artists?” There are many reasons why NFTs for music could be desirable.\n\nFans want to own a piece of history, and NFTs are a great way to collect rare music with the security and ownership that comes with blockchain verification.\n\nFor fans of artists like Grimes and Kings of Leon, this has been an opportunity to get closer to their idols, while others have seen the potential for making money.\n\nArtists and bands oftentimes tie in additional perks to their NFTs where fans can secure access to exclusive rewards and experiences like VIP tickets for the next tour or studio sessions with band members. Take Alaina Castillo for example, who recently[ sold-out](https://www.sound.xyz/alainacastillo/sad-girls-always-finish-first) a drop on[ Sound.xyz](http://sound.xyz). The winner of her Golden Egg received 2 VIP passes to Weekend 2 of Coachella and watch her perform live. How cool is that?\n\nSo, why would anyone pay over $1,000 for a digital record?\n\nThe answer is simple: the people buying this NFT aren’t just buying a digital file. They are investing in the future of their favorite artists, and an opportunity to support them in an entirely new way.\n\n## Why are Artists Selling Music as NFTs?\n\nMusicians are selling their songs as NFTs for a variety of reasons. Some may see it as a way to diversify revenue streams, while others may view NFTs as a marketing tool or simply an extension of their brand.\n\nThe potential benefits for artists who sell music as NFTs include:\n\n* Generating new income streams\n* Increasing fan engagement\n* Gaining instant exposure to a new type of audience online\n* Building your brand and reputation in the industry\n\nTake Daniel Allan for example, who[ raised $180,000](https://adamlevy.io/2022/01/11/breaking-down-the-infamous-overstim-journey/) for his EP titled Overstimulated. The project and story are a true work of art and exemplify what's possible with just 300 Twitter followers and an ambition to succeed.\n\nEven if they don’t directly profit from selling NFTs initially, they may gain new fans who will buy merchandise or attend shows in person later on.\n\nIndependent artist Queen George, for example, [hosted a concert during at Eth Denver](https://adamlevy.io/2022/03/01/nft-ticket-case-study-queen-george-on-growth-hacking-collectors/) in February of 2022, where she performed for a crypto-native audience. She minted tickets for free as NFTs and gained over 100 Ethereum collectors who attended future concerts, purchased her NFTs, and now regularly listen to her music.\n\n## 2 Different Types of Music NFTs\n\nThe main types of music NFTs today revolve around two themes: patronage and ownership. You own both NFTs at the end of the day, though what you own differs across each type. Throughout this section, I'll be including some episodes from the podcast for you to reference.\n\n### Patronage NFTs\n\nPatronage-based NFTs are collected to support an artist with collector upside derived from appreciating secondary sales.\n\nArtist royalties are accrued through secondary sales and, depending on their popularity, often outpace what one would earn through web2 streaming platforms. Reference RAC as an example:\n\n[https://twitter.com/RAC/status/1516578113634725890](https://twitter.com/RAC/status/1516578113634725890)\n\nPatronage evangelists argue that, for the first time, there’s finally a way to value a song in its proper artistic form, hence why it’s worth collecting.\n\nYou can gain a solid understanding of this narrative by listening to my episode with Catalog founders[ Mike Mckain and Jeremy Stern](https://adamlevy.io/2022/03/10/heres-how-nfts-are-enabling-a-better-future-for-music-with-catalog/), who shared why music NFTs and the art of collecting are merely the start of building a better future for the music industry.\n\nIt’d be worth checking out[ Mint Song’s take](https://adamlevy.io/2022/02/22/redefining-music-metadata-and-decentralizing-spotify/) on this narrative as well as[ LimeWire’s perspective](https://adamlevy.io/2022/03/31/do-music-nfts-work-in-favor-of-record-labels/) on this model.\n\n### Ownership NFTs\n\nOwnership-based music NFTs involve buying a fraction of a song’s IP, with collector upside generated through copyrights and streaming royalties accrued by the song on web2 platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nWhile ownership on-chain is still a grey area, some call this format a meme, while others argue this is the most authentic way to value a song.\n\nNFT thought leader, EDM DJ, and founder of[ Royal.io](http://royal.io) Justin Blau [outlines his perspective](https://adamlevy.io/2022/03/29/the-collectors-guide-to-music-nfts-owning-vs-patronage/) on the two different formats and why the ownership model will eventually prevail.\n\n## Who Are the Top Music NFT Artists?\n\nAs a medium that's still in development, there are few prominent music artists churning out fully-realized NFTs. The list is quite short, and includes some of the following:\n\n* 3LAU ([@3LAU](https://twitter.com/3LAU))\n* Snoop Dogg ([@SnoopDogg](https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg))\n* Pussy Riot ([@pussyrrriot](https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot))\n* Daniel Allan ([@imdanielallan](https://twitter.com/imdanielallan))\n* RAC ([@RAC](https://twitter.com/RAC))\n* LATASHÁ ([@CallMeLatasha](https://twitter.com/CallMeLatasha))\n* Jonathan Mann ([@songadaymann](https://twitter.com/songadaymann))\n* Grady ([@whoinvitedgrady](https://twitter.com/whoinvitedgrady))\n* Grimes ([@Grimezsz](https://twitter.com/Grimezsz))\n* Steve Aoki ([@steveaoki](https://twitter.com/steveaoki))\n* Kings of Leon ([@KingsOfLeon](https://twitter.com/KingsOfLeon))\n* VÉRITÉ ([@Verite](https://twitter.com/Verite))\n* Spottie WIFI ([@SpottieWiFi](https://twitter.com/SpottieWiFi))\n* Matthew Chaim ([@matthewchaim](https://twitter.com/matthewchaim))\n\nSome artists worth keeping an eye on\n\n* Queen George ([@iamqueengeorge](https://twitter.com/iamqueengeorge))\n* Wobblebug ([@Wobblebug](https://twitter.com/Wobblebug))\n* Reo Cragun ([@ReoCragun](https://twitter.com/ReoCragun))\n* Heno.

The list includes everyone from everyday NFT collectors to super fans, large investors, and other musicians to record labels. These are the people who are fueling the rise in music NFTs—and helping them scale from a niche market into a mainstream phenomenon.\n\nIn Mint Season 4, we learned that Justin Blau doesn’t understand the value of collecting purely patronage-based NFTs, while collectors like Cooper Turley have spent over 100 ETH on them.\n\nCooper’s session ended up being the most extended episode in the season, coming in hot with 1.5 hours of pure alpha.\n\nWe talk about everything from his NFT investment thesis, buying editions vs. one-of-ones, tokenomics, and so much more.\n\nAnother collector worth checking out is Brett Shear, aka BlockchainBrett. He's the head of venture investments for DJ Kygo's Palm Tree Crew fund. He's one of the OGs who started collecting music NFTs before anyone really knew what they were.\n\nI've curated the top 300 music NFT collectors by Twitter Handle, Crypto Address, Platform Collected On, and Estimated Portfolio Networth.\n\nTo view this detailed database, you'll need to collect Mint Season 4's Participation Pin and unlock the page for access. More info can be found [here](https://adamlevy.io/s4-nft-pin/).\n\n## How Do NFTs Help Musicians Better Monetize Their Work?\n\nThe upside for musicians is that NFTs are a new way to monetize their work in the digital realm. Especially when paired with streaming services, NFTs provide a new digital way for fans of the music to buy and collect it. Collectors can trade or resell their digital assets with true on-chain ownership of an artist's NFT at will.\n\nNFTs have a number of potential benefits for musicians, including:\n\n* Enable them to sell a one-off item\n* Provide a new revenue stream from sales of \"collectible\" versions of their art\n* Provide a way to sell a \"digital experience.\"\n\n## Top Platforms To Collect & Mint Music NFTs\n\nI'm also looking at the opportunity from an investor standpoint. There are already numerous examples of people earning returns that would be considered life-changing for most people.\n\nSo, here's a list of a few platforms to collect and mint music NFTs. Some are gated and undergo a highly curated process, while others are free to mint. Every platform is open to collectors.\n\n**Curated and gated NFT minting**\n\n* Catalog ([@catalogworks](https://twitter.com/catalogworks)) [Catalog.works](http://catalog.works)\n* Sound ([Sound.xyz](http://sound.xyz))\n* Royal ([@join_royal](https://twitter.com/join_royal))\n* Decent ([@decentxyz](https://twitter.com/decentxyz))\n* Bolero Music ([@boleromusic_](https://twitter.com/boleromusic_))\n* Beat Foundry ([@BeatFoundryNFTs](https://twitter.com/BeatFoundryNFTs))\n* SoundMint ([@soundmintxyz](https://twitter.com/soundmintxyz))\n\n**Free NFT minting**\n\n* Zora ([@ourZORA](https://twitter.com/ourZORA))\n* Mint Songs ([@mintsongs](https://twitter.com/mintsongs))\n* Manifold ([@manifoldxyz](https://twitter.com/manifoldxyz))\n* Mirror ([@viamirror](https://twitter.com/viamirror))\n\n## Where to Publish Music in Web3\n\nBeyond publishing your music on Spotify, Apple Music, and related streaming platforms, I highly recommend you explore Audius, the SoundCloud of Web3.\n\nThe decentralized streaming platform allows artists to host their music and listeners to stream it. Like SoundCloud, Audius lets you upload your songs, create playlists and follow other users. But unlike SoundCloud, Audius is decentralized and peer-to-peer so no one can censor your music.\n\nWhat does that mean? Instead of having to pay for data centers to store the music files, Audius shares all files and metadata using IPFS by creator node services, registered on Audius smart contracts. And instead of having to pay for servers to route traffic between users, Audius uses IPFS to connect users directly with each other.\n\nFurthermore, Audius may be a better solution for artists and listeners over centralized platforms like SoundCloud and Spotify in the long run as all users have platform upside via the $AUDIO token on Solana.\n\n## Best Communities To Join in Web3 Music\n\nYou may have heard about these crypto-based communities, known as web3 groups. These are often on Discord, Telegram, and other platforms, where fans can congregate to discuss particular NFT projects.\n\nHere's a list of some of the best web3 communities for music NFTs:\n\n* Overstim DAO ([@imdanielallan](https://twitter.com/imdanielallan))\n* Good Karma DAO ([@goodkarmadao](https://twitter.com/goodkarmadao))\n* Song Camp ([@songcamp_](https://twitter.com/songcamp_))\n* Friends with Benefits ([@FWBtweets](https://twitter.com/FWBtweets))\n* Fluff World[ (@flufworld](https://twitter.com/flufworld))\n* Dreams Never Die Records DAO ([@dreamsnevrdie](https://twitter.com/dreamsnevrdie))\n* HiFi Labs ([@hifilabs](https://twitter.com/hifilabs))\n* [Sound.xyz](http://sound.xyz) ([Sound.xyz](http://sound.xyz))\n* Catalog ([@catalogworks](https://twitter.com/catalogworks))\n* Mint Songs ([@mintsongs](https://twitter.com/mintsongs))\n* [Royal.io](http://royal.io) ([@join_royal](https://twitter.com/join_royal))\n* BPM ([@club_______bpm](https://twitter.com/club_______bpm))\n* Bolero Music ([@boleromusic_](https://twitter.com/boleromusic_))\n* [Decent.xyz](http://decent.xyz) ([@decentxyz](https://twitter.com/decentxyz))\n* SoundMint ([@soundmintxyz](https://twitter.com/soundmintxyz))\n* Beat Foundry ([@BeatFoundryNFTs](https://twitter.com/BeatFoundryNFTs))\n* Arpeggi Labs ([@arpeggi_labs](https://twitter.com/arpeggi_labs))\n\nAdditionally, all of crypto and web3 lives on Twitter, so if you don't have an account, start one. If you already have an account, engage with the right thought leaders and shit posters to curate the ultimate feed. A good place to start is following some of the folks I follow:[ https://twitter.com/levychain/following](https://twitter.com/levychain/following)\n\n## Best Content To Consume in Web3\n\nWith the explosion of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2021, there’s an increasing demand for content that can help people understand why NFTs are important. The following resources will help you learn what you need to know about web3, DAOs, social tokens and NFTs:\n\n* Mint Podcast ([@levychain](https://twitter.com/levychain)) ;)\n* Bankless ([@BanklessHQ](https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ))\n* Otherside podcast by Chase Chapman ([@chaserchapman](https://twitter.com/chaserchapman))\n* SeedClub Podcast with Jess Sloss (@[seedclubpodcast](https://twitter.com/seedclubpodcast))\n* Pomp Podcast ([@APompliano](https://twitter.com/APompliano))\n* Zima Red ([@zima_red](https://twitter.com/zima_red))\n* NFTnow Podcast ([@nftnow](https://twitter.com/nftnow))\n* Delphi Digital Podcast ([@PodcastDelphi](https://twitter.com/PodcastDelphi))\n* Water and Music ([@water_and_music](https://twitter.com/water_and_music))\n* This Week in Music NFTs ([@Cooopahtroopa](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa))\n* The Cutting Edge with Gmoney ([@gmoneyNFT](https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT))\n* many others that I’m missing\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe guide is only a short introduction to the world of music NFTs, but hopefully, it provides you with enough information to begin your artist journey in web3. There are many more aspects of the ecosystem that have not been covered in this guide, and future posts will likely go more into depth on specific topics.\n\nIf you have any questions about NFTs or preparing a drop, hit me up whenever on socials: @levychain everywhere.\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nSubscribe to my newsletter to stay up to date on my podcast Mint where I deliver the latest insights brewing across the web3 creator economy:\n\n[https://levychain.substack.com/](https://levychain.substack.com/)\n\n**Twitter**\n\nFollow me!\n\n[https://twitter.com/levychain](https://twitter.com/levychain)\n\n\n---\n\nNothing here is intended to be financial advice.

Life update!\n\nI’m joining [Pioneer](https://pioneer.app) as an investor to help build a better home for day 0 founders.

Part of generating success as a founder is being a winner, and oftentimes traditional institutions aren’t set up to breed them. This is what startups do well! In fact, it’s a common notion that a few months at an early stage startup will eventually outperform a traditional business school experience. The only issue is that when one becomes a founder for the first time, they tend to lack guidance and work with a low level of efficiency (at least until they start ramping up).

We will create a better theater, by the people, for the people.\n\n## What does this mean in real terms?\n\nMovieTheaterDAO aims to redefine the utility of the modern movie theater by reimagining it as a multi-use space with a community-driven programming format. This would not just be for theatrical film entertainment, but could include: musical performances, comedy shows, seminars, [VR rooms,](https://dreamscapeimmersive.com) educational offerings using screens and VR for schools and universities, NFT galleries, watch-parties for TV shows, co-working spaces, and so many other possibilities, all utilizing the same physical space of a movie theater. What if you could implement a tokenized system of ticketing, instead of USD? Instead of a generic, popcorn-scented lobby with the basic concessions, imagine a multi-use atrium that offered bold flavors like Thai food, Tacos, or Mediterranean. We would also work on partnering with any and all entertainment-related web3 communities to become the official entertainment hub of web3. MovieTheaterDAO hopes to be the de-facto theater where web3-funded films and TV shows host their premieres. We would also be an obvious choice for independent films to host their premieres or show screenings, as we would aim to remove much of the bureaucratic red-tape that usually stands in the way of independent filmmakers. If you are a MovieTheaterDAO member, you will automatically have a screen to share your projects with the world.\n\nImagine all of these possibilities, with the governance of a laser-focused DAO, led by experienced professionals from the entertainment and theatrical industries, web3, and other relevant fields. Wouldn’t this be a far more efficient and equitable way to use the space of a 25k sq. ft multiplex than the way these spaces are currently being used? *As a DAO, we will buy and/or develop a movie theater to meet these goals.*\n\n## Why MovieTheaterDAO?\n\nTheaters all across the globe are struggling with [lowered attendance](https://news.gallup.com/poll/388538/movie-theater-attendance-far-below-historical-norms.aspx) and increased overhead costs. The most crucial economic hurdle that the modern theater or multiplex faces isn’t simply the waning demand relative to the growing global entertainment economy, but that the rising cost of real estate for housing one or several screens has become untenable relative to the public’s interest in going to the theater. If the real issue here is space, then the seemingly obvious solution would be to pivot to a different business model that utilizes these enormous retail spaces in a vastly different way during non-prime hours.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IEQzeyF1YrogOxnl5I0kz.png?height=548&width=1124)\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the major theater chains have been unwilling to make drastic changes to this business model. Not only do they fear that radical changes would lead to a more rapid consolidation of their industry, they lack the vision necessary to create the entertainment experience of the future.\n\nThat is why it is on us to fix this broken model and create one that better services our needs, without the baggage that these corporations carry. *The best path forward in achieving this goal is to leverage the utility of web3 community-building and fundraising, with the organizational structure of a DAO to help govern our collective resources. The best path forward is MovieTheaterDAO.*\n\n## Phase 1\n\nWith Phase 1 we will aim to achieve these main goals:\n\n* Build a robust community that will participate in creating our vision and roadmap. This will involve the use of socials like Twitter, Discord, Instagram, and a website.\n* Plan and execute an NFT sale to raise the necessary funds to purchase the lease of a theater space and to fund the costs of renovation, as well as construction of our other concepts for the space, while also building an operating treasury. Compliant with all U.S. securities laws, these NFTs will represent degrees of token allocation and will count as memberships and vendor passes to MovieTheaterDAO and the ensuing entertainment hub that we will create.\n* Build a team through our community and source for relevant experts, creating roles that will be compensated through our treasury. Our team will systematically work on projects to be determined by our leaders and our community.\n* Begin process of identifying retail options for our movie theater. We will either identify and focus on a single retail space, or we will create a concept that we will shop to multiple retail developers. This will have to be in a major urban center, most likely Los Angeles but possibly New York, or even Miami. The founder of MovieTheaterDAO is already in talks with a real estate firm representing a recently closed multiplex in the center of Los Angeles, who are in the pre-planning stages of renovating and redesigning the space. We will make community-based decisions on how to approach our retail options, but creating a proposal to bring to the aforementioned space in L.A. will likely be one of our initial projects.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nJw1wtvC0LfIy9-vtrw89.png?height=509&width=1000)\n\n## Community\n\nWe aren’t just looking for film and entertainment fanatics, but for anyone who is enthusiastic about the potential use-cases for web3 and community-building through the blockchain. So if you love movie theaters, hate movie theaters, or anything in between, we want you to help us shape our vision of the moviegoing experience of tomorrow.

For DefCom, community boils down to a few key points:\n\n* Shared Identity\n  * We are all here because we believe in blockchain, NFTs, Crypto and Web3\n* Shared Purpose\n  * We all want to achieve freedom, whether that is creative, personal, financial or however you define freedom.  \n Web3 is the evolution of freedom: Freedom from... Freedom to... Freedom to be\n* Shared Compassion\n  * We have all been taught that there is strength in numbers. Coretta King said '*The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members.'*  If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, then go together\n\n## What is DefCom Labs?\n\nThe purpose of DefCom Labs can be spelled out in 2 statements:\n\n* It is a conglomerate of utility and products\n* It is a community built around cultivating skilled web3 enthusiasts\n\nBoth of these go hand in hand. DefCom Labs' mission is providing different tools, resources and platforms that our members can not only use for immediate gain, but also harness to improve their skills, develop as an individual, and guide themselves to a future position they see themselves being in.\n\n> *'Give a Degen a mint and you feed them for a day; teach a Degen to mint and you feed them for a lifetime'* -7amza.eth\n\nAll jokes a side, we believe that it is more worthwhile to teach someone how to be self-sufficient, than to continually be doing the work for them. \n\nIntellectual progress and progress in general is made by building upon the knowledge and understanding gained by those who came before us. \n\nStanding on the shoulders of giants is key to new ideas, innovation and creativity; so why not build a staircase to those shoulders and give new minds a head start.\n\n## Current Developments\n\nCurrently, two platforms/suites are currently in the pipeline and being developed in collaboration with other teams who have abundant experience in their fields. Unfortunately, I am unable to go into more details for each product as of now but rest assured, they will fall perfectly inline with the projects mission. One will be geared more towards asset growth while the other will be geared towards personal development and networking. \n\nAs always, I hope to speak to you all soon and more details to come. :SaluteEmoji:", "timestamp": 1657142461, "digest": "tH1v83ramW0ePzmtWrLg6GwMNzepStHsQPurP8gbCzs", "contributor": "0xD1691D8Ecc04eD5368C1CD055d408b2A30Ee2BE7"}

If you are a MovieTheaterDAO member, you will automatically have a screen to share your projects with the world.\n\nImagine all of these possibilities, with the governance of a laser-focused DAO, led by experienced professionals from the entertainment and theatrical industries, web3, and other relevant fields. Wouldn’t this be a far more efficient and equitable way to use the space of a 25k sq. ft multiplex than the way these spaces are currently being used? *As a DAO, we will buy and/or develop a movie theater to meet these goals.*\n\n## Why MovieTheaterDAO?\n\nTheaters all across the globe are struggling with [lowered attendance](https://news.gallup.com/poll/388538/movie-theater-attendance-far-below-historical-norms.aspx) and increased overhead costs. The most crucial economic hurdle that the modern theater or multiplex faces isn’t simply the waning demand relative to the growing global entertainment economy, but that the rising cost of real estate for housing one or several screens has become untenable relative to the public’s interest in going to the theater. If the real issue here is space, then the seemingly obvious solution would be to pivot to a different business model that utilizes these enormous retail spaces in a vastly different way during non-prime hours.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IEQzeyF1YrogOxnl5I0kz.png?height=548&width=1124)\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the major theater chains have been unwilling to make drastic changes to this business model. Not only do they fear that radical changes would lead to a more rapid consolidation of their industry, they lack the vision necessary to create the entertainment experience of the future.\n\nThat is why it is on us to fix this broken model and create one that better services our needs, without the baggage that these corporations carry. *The best path forward in achieving this goal is to leverage the utility of web3 community-building and fundraising, with the organizational structure of a DAO to help govern our collective resources.

This will involve the use of socials like Twitter, Discord, Instagram, and a website.\n* Plan and execute an NFT sale to raise the necessary funds to purchase the lease of a theater space and to fund the costs of renovation, as well as construction of our other concepts for the space, while also building an operating treasury. Compliant with all U.S. securities laws, these NFTs will represent degrees of token allocation and will count as memberships and vendor passes to MovieTheaterDAO and the ensuing entertainment hub that we will create.\n* Build a team through our community and source for relevant experts, creating roles that will be compensated through our treasury. Our team will systematically work on projects to be determined by our leaders and our community.\n* Begin process of identifying retail options for our movie theater. We will either identify and focus on a single retail space, or we will create a concept that we will shop to multiple retail developers. This will have to be in a major urban center, most likely Los Angeles but possibly New York, or even Miami. The founder of MovieTheaterDAO is already in talks with a real estate firm representing a recently closed multiplex in the center of Los Angeles, who are in the pre-planning stages of renovating and redesigning the space. We will make community-based decisions on how to approach our retail options, but creating a proposal to bring to the aforementioned space in L.A. will likely be one of our initial projects.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nJw1wtvC0LfIy9-vtrw89.png?height=509&width=1000)\n\n## Community\n\nWe aren’t just looking for film and entertainment fanatics, but for anyone who is enthusiastic about the potential use-cases for web3 and community-building through the blockchain. So if you love movie theaters, hate movie theaters, or anything in between, we want you to help us shape our vision of the moviegoing experience of tomorrow.

We will create a better theater, by the people, for the people.\n\n## What does this mean in real terms?\n\nMovieTheaterDAO aims to redefine the utility of the modern movie theater by reimagining it as a multi-use space with a community-driven programming format. This would not just be for theatrical film entertainment, but could include: musical performances, comedy shows, professional seminars, [VR rooms,](https://dreamscapeimmersive.com) educational offerings for schools and universities, NFT galleries, watch-parties for TV shows, film festivals, fairs, co-working spaces, and so many other possibilities- all utilizing the same physical space of a movie theater. What if you could implement a tokenized system of ticketing, instead of USD? Instead of a generic, popcorn-scented lobby with the basic concessions, imagine a multi-use atrium that offered bold flavors like Thai food, Tacos, or Mediterranean. We would also work on partnering with any and all entertainment-related web3 communities to become the official entertainment hub of web3. MovieTheaterDAO hopes to be the de-facto theater where web3-funded films and TV shows host their premieres.

{"id": "n1JyMHCvKCfDxOc4xi9WHRsQ1JCXymYfDKA3yymjBEA", "title": "Mobile Society", "body": "Given the vitriol around this subject in the past decade, I’ve been hesitant to elaborate on why it’s not only an inevitable development, but a necessary part of human evolution. In all honesty, I’m writing this now not to convince anyone, but to gather my thoughts about several observations and really substantiate the personal conclusion that to this point has felt unshakeable.\n\n### Smartphones\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN0SVBCJqLs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN0SVBCJqLs)\n\nIs the iPod a phone? No, but by now we understand that the iPod has been a monumental precursor to [a daily life PDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant).\n\nHere’s the famous iPhone reveal:\n\n[https://youtu.be/MnrJzXM7a6o](https://youtu.be/MnrJzXM7a6o)\n\nHere’s the first preview of an Android smartphone:\n\n[https://youtu.be/nmniBnVB6wA](https://youtu.be/nmniBnVB6wA)\n\nThe key takeaway, for obvious reasons, is Steve Jobs explaining that not only would one device would contain all of these capabilities, but the “leapfrog” component would be a revolutionary UI upgrade. There could be some argument about the finer details, but look at whatever phone you have now: they all contain elements of this UI revolution. In a poetic sense, this UI was custom-fit for one’s preference for personal effects. In the present, when you leave your home, what do you bring with you? Typically, internet-native generations do not carry around briefcases. The same vibe can be felt at the lockscreen and the main page.\n\nNow, let’s consider the recent Solana Mobile Stack & Saga reveal:\n\n[https://youtu.be/a7uNhIy-mpw](https://youtu.be/a7uNhIy-mpw)\n\nI think most of the backlash is unwarranted, but in all sincerity, is this the leapfrog platform? What is it about Saga that will change everything we do on the blockchain, on our phones? Personally, I compare the announcement of Saga with the iPod. The clear parallel is that the problem being solved is economic, primarily that we as mobile developers and users are bound to a duopoly of distributors: the Apple App Store, and the Google Play Store. Additionally, while much of web3 is exactly that, webapp-centric, most of us are still looking for a smoother, more secure, and mobile-first access. But I also think that there will be a common mobile stack for OSS devices, which will force a universal logistical understanding of OSS hardware, all the way down to the source of silicon.\n\nUnfortunately, we’ve been siloed by dopamine hacks. Most popular web and mobile apps tend to be addicting by design. Are we going to leapfrog the mobile experience of today by eschewing or embracing that quality? As an optimist and a pragmatist, I fixate on the natural serotonin/dopamine experience: repetitive accomplishment and socialization. The problem with social media is that it is cherrypicked & microcosmic; that we receive a warped sense of achievement and belonging. However, for the next generation of mobile devices, augmentation of the natural experience will be imperative. Additionally, the leapfrog moment will happen when there is no primary device swallowing the market share of your daily life. We should be chasing a dopamine-free interface that connects us to whatever we want without demanding that we stare at a screen or constantly pull a mini-tablet or an earpod pack out of our pockets.\n\nThe point is, you shouldn’t sleep on mobile-centric blockchain development. It will change how you perceive enjoyment, how you find motivation, and how you choose to interact with a universal economy.\n\n### VR, AR, & the Metaverse\n\nPersonally, I was looking forward to AR to the point of obsession. There were two major broadcasts that captured just how powerful this might have become, were there not ethical concerns (will expand on this further below):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRhfiv9OlPQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRhfiv9OlPQ)\n\nNotice the visible discomfort of the people who notice they are being recorded. There was also this [applied “bionic supervision”](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0960-1317/21/12/125014) contact lens, which I still believe has not been popularized enough to evaluate. Since then, the technology has improved somewhat, but our main source of nontraditional display with wide adoption has been [the Oculus](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game). Now, it’s a major component of Facebook’s transition into Meta. The point to this subject is that we as humans love to invent and use tools, and AR/VR has been a cultural obsession for quite a few decades.\n\n![In retrospect, we've always fantasized about the convenience.](https://teachingandlearninginhighered.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/school-year-2000.jpg)\n\nThe key idea of these interfaces and our pleasurable experiences has been a “shortcut” through KBM/screen interfaces. For a time, there was a PC revolution, and much of the sci-fi revolved around interacting digitally from the comfort of one’s home.\n\n![Prescient and hilarious](https://medias.spotern.com/spots/w640/176/176252-1547318105.webp)\n\nNow, we’ve acclimated to the reality of mobile UX being more EV from a service provider’s perspective, and the hardware constantly hits inflection points like [the earpod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_headphones#EarPods) and [RFID implants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microchip_implant_(human)). There’s even a cyborg pioneer in Ethereum:\n\n[https://youtu.be/8rT1wB4lZ9s](https://youtu.be/8rT1wB4lZ9s)\n\nA lot of IRL use cases become a lot more real, like a cashless society or more secure building/container access. In the metaverse, this translates as a more convenient & spontaneous “login”. Consider the experience of joining a Twitter space. I would describe the technological advances as an increasingly more usable schizotypal experience. It doesn’t need to be more specifically articulated, the focal understanding of the metaverse is that it is powerful enough to divorce us from physical reality. With respect to stacking this on top of cryptoeconomics, all of a sudden the privilege of constantly capitalizing personal experience in both realities become the same dimension; all of a sudden we have a paramount, unadulterated source of truth that can both anchor and uncouple us from what we need to observe in order to believe. This is mobility of an existential nature.\n\n### Bodycams & Personal Surveillance\n\nThis section is going to be controversial, because it takes a lot of alarming mechanics for granted. For example, we’ve known for many years that modern society and exposure to consumer electronics [have involved a panopticon surveillance network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM). [There are also private service providers of the same nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies#Products). So when something like Google Glass comes along, it’s more than fair to criticize how invasive it is, and where Alphabet is extracting data from. However, we have developed a culture of accountability through these technologies, like mandating police bodycams. The imperfections and failures of this culture is [not mandating the full, transparent disclosure and access control of the public](https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/police-body-cameras). If there was an analogue bodycam that upheld the standard of self-sovereign data, or the flow of information was constricted to tamper-evident hardware in verifiable events and participants in public settings, this would be different.\n\n> Without good policies, they risk becoming just another police surveillance device—and one with very real potential to invade privacy. Especially important are policies governing when the cameras are turned on, and who has access to the footage and under what conditions. -ACLU\n\nEthics aside, what does the future look like? Firstly, I’m not going to say with any degree of confidence that we will have unbreakably tamper-evident hardware. There is possibility of [quantum key encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution), and we’ve seen experiments where on-chain endpoints have been constructed with fewer hypothetical insecurities.\n\n[https://creators.mirror.xyz/5heGuW5JIkDp67D4j4DtRpAi4ToiJzCeNFunU4cjkBw](https://creators.mirror.xyz/5heGuW5JIkDp67D4j4DtRpAi4ToiJzCeNFunU4cjkBw)\n\nBut none of it matters. We can already assume that so much of what we intend to keep private is already exfiltrated by entities with enough resources that already exist. The question isn’t “what privacy concerns do we have about this consumer/opensource technology”, it’s actually “what marginal capability of abusing privacy will this consumer/opensource technology grant bad actors, given the preexisting disabuse of privacy by persistent threat actors?”.\n\n![Sorry, not sorry](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uBKDIcHAK4O-xldzlUDRx.png?height=1435&width=1440)\n\nIn order to be a truly mobile society, we have to be a truly free society. One might argue that personal surveillance devices with verifiable public hardware limiters is a balancing force, so long as the public is fully knowledgeable.\n\n### Implants, Transhumanism, and Public Safety\n\nI suspect most of the technology that will manifest a mobile society is the technology that negates uncertainty. Deepfakes are a lot harder to produce if there is a common standard for secure & private verification metadata. Physical locations are harder to silently break into if the locks are not only tamper-evident, but also require some temporary allowance from multiple parties that cannot collude. Personally identifiable information, like health or purchase metadata, is a lot harder to exploit if there’s no middleman or server-based data storage. These things in their current iterations need improvement, and they won’t be perfect for a long time, but we can imagine the tangible end result.\n\nConsider the cutting edge for microchip implants. (btw, keep an eye on biohacking forums like [Dangerous Things](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/)). [There definitely are fundamental insecurities in this sort of hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack), however microchip implants that one might find in their pet are physically short range, meaning that in order even read what’s on the chip, one has to be in very close proximity. This means that one has to be physically detained by, or within an unusually close proximity to, one’s attacker. There are also other limitations like physical fragility & read/write capabilities, but these things are no more a limitation than what we currently use, like smartphones or smart tags ([which are already being abused by bad actors](https://ww2.motorists.org/blog/the-criminal-use-of-apple-airtags/)).\n\nWith microchip implants come biometrics. We already have a very intense commission for personal health, but with these devices, the body of medical knowledge would increase at an accelerated rate. We may have preventative medicine that is so effective that the resulting windfall in falling healthcare costs might spark a renaissance in unrelated industries. However, with the illegality of certain biological processes, this can go very wrong, very quickly. Just because it’s bound to happen, doesn’t mean we need to learn to be helpless in the face of it. Now is the time explore how these health implants [evolve our fitness](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1500242112), [how they break](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/31/hacking-risk-recall-pacemakers-patient-death-fears-fda-firmware-update), and [how we secure the data they produce](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/07/20/homomorphic.html).\n\nThis extends to our globally connected economy. With a suspension of disbelief, consider the possibilities:\n\n* all supply chains, public and private, go through facilities where a member of the public can verify that security guards are on-premise & incapable of collusion.\n* personal or public belongings of any kind can be stored in any connected location without risk of theft, and reputational cost if abused by a member of the public with access.\n* any member of the public can permissionlessly work in any publicly connected (private or public) premise with implied reputational costs & get compensated by a free, open labor market by the quality of their labor (“skilled” or not). Without invasive surveillance.\n* any member of the public can receive a p2p education in any vocation and immediately apply it in practice.\n* collegiate environments where there are no more letter grades or GPA, only a high-resolution record of a student’s conduct, without need for admission to that environment.\n* a world where physical prisons and dedicated police become obsolete, or home arrest is publicly verifiable and instantaneously turned on & off by a constrained public decision-making process that is extremely costly to abuse or collude against.\n* blind ballots in democratic votes are not only orders of magnitude more secure, but orders of magnitude more costly to delegitimize.\n* everyone carries around more ergonomic, workhorse PCs, and securely plug into any grid to get paid for any digital workload.\n* people get paid throughout a casual day via the wealth of public data they collect & produce.\n* ad agencies become obsolete because word-of-mouth advertisement can be quantified and compensated without leaving the conversation or succumbing to collusion.\n\nCan these technologies be abused by the public and turned into a dystopian future? Absolutely, and there’s no time like the present to be aware of the problem and expeditiously reinforce the better outcome, especially in the context of our present society. With the current dystopia and the optionality of the future, we can become more mobile individuals and still benefit a collectivist good. We don’t have to succumb to the inevitable abuse of technology by the few behind the curtain.\n\nIn conclusion, I see a lot of inevitable technological shifts that will happen within most of our lifetimes. It is not prudent to discredit or dismiss these trends. Many of these improvements are leapfrog technologies, changing the way we physically or digitally interact (earpods being a recent and powerful example), but the main impact is changing how we think about transactions and our rights. There’s quite a bit to disintermediate commercially, but this is more so a fundamental and existential shift. History will be recorded differently and be more granularly “true”, our sense of logistics and economics will change dramatically, the sensation of pleasure will come from completely novel sources that we can certifiably comprehend as more beneficial than getting a social media notification. There’s too much to imagine, but the focus in the present should be centered on what might have gone wrong already, what will go wrong if we’re not cautious, what changes we need to anticipate, and most importantly, how we improvise with the tools we have now and further on. **Do not sleep on the experiments that will change the fabric of our mobile society.**", "timestamp": 1657146649, "digest": "gto5jXXjJlnavCvsvUWiX9sHpMbQ5d-hnYlOmOfWduk", "contributor": "0xb03F5438f9A243De5C3B830B7841EC315034cD5f"}

{"id": "aAyBCDSbgJ8Pf8hgN9bd-rPpI1amcT0g0Rsb2oN28wg", "title": "How ΞNUMs Bridge To SMS", "body": "ΞNUM messaging NFTs replace insecure phone numbers with Web3 messaging endpoints. What makes ΞNUM’s special is that they also work as a valid phone number. This means you can use your Web3 native NFT in any situation where you would normally use a traditional phone number, for example, when registering with popular messaging apps like Signal or Telegram, or for 2FA when logging onto websites. Because ΞNUMs function as valid phone numbers, they can interact with legacy SMS users and systems. \n\n**A quick explainer on how that works:**\n\nAll ΞNUM-based phone numbers use a new special country code that is different from those used by legacy mobile numbers based on geographic country codes. All SMS messages sent to an ΞNUM number are sent to the gateway registered to handle this special top-level country code. The ΞNUM Relay Gateway does not keep a database to map the specific number to the owner. Instead, the number is looked up on the blockchain to retrieve the public key associated with this number. The message is encrypted with the public key, and the ΞNUM Messenger is notified to retrieve it. Only the ΞNUM Messenger with the private key can receive and decrypt the message.\n\nThe most feature rich and secure way to use ΞNUM’s is in the ΞNUM Messenger, which is based on the Signal protocol, enabling interoperability with the existing 40 million Signal users. The ΞNUM Messenger uses the secure ΞNUM phone number as the public key to encrypt and authenticate all data sent to other ΞNUM Messengers and ΞNUM Relay Servers. You can think of this as secure encrypted VoIP. Because these communications transmit over data networks, there is no SIM card associated with your number to compromise. When a legacy phone number (+1-555-1212) sends a message to a user that has an ΞNUM, it is sent to the ΞNUM Relay Servers, then encrypted and sent to the owner of the ΞNUM. With this approach, you can say goodbye to SIM-swap attacks.\n\nWe are building toward a future where people will purchase data-only mobile plans and use ΞNUM for secure messaging that also supports legacy SMS/Voice through a gateway. \n\nLearn more about our novel messaging NFTs by [clicking here](https://mirror.xyz/enumdao.eth/6TvRRDdmRinVLFaGMQZHA932uvL-obHr3UzzoHHKaMI)\n\nConnect with our team by joining our Discord Server by [clicking here](https://discord.gg/cxFU8NvCYV)\n\nFollow us on Twitter by [clicking here](https://twitter.com/enumdao)\n\nStay up to date with our newsletter: [enum.wtf](https://enum.wtf/)\n\nJoin our Signal + Alpha Waitlist [here](https://www.enum.wtf/signal-ens-waitlist).\n\n \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1657148884, "digest": "7aIKR04ln1w1yFmM7b7naXxMW2W05BLN12ICBdXGb9k", "contributor": "0xc0513cc051d3BA9c0BB62438402272b2A44E2A6c"}

{"id": "EM09_u140CiCI1AWXrK8lZECycvxLceo9oj8sB8FE9o", "title": "Welcome To MovieTheaterDAO", "body": "## What is MovieTheaterDAO?\n\nInspired by projects like [LinksDAO](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/linksdao-raised-millions-selling-nfts-to-buy-a-golf-course.html) or [ConstitutionDAO](https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution), MovieTheaterDAO is an organization with the primary goal of purchasing the lease of a multi-screen movie theater in a major urban center in the U.S. MovieTheaterDAO will leverage the organizational structure of a DAO and NFT ownership to help create a concept for an entertainment hub that better utilizes the modern theatrical retail space, and tailor it to what the community wants and needs. We will create a better theater, by the people, for the people.\n\n## What does this mean in real terms?\n\nMovieTheaterDAO aims to redefine the utility of the modern movie theater by reimagining it as a multi-use space with a community-driven programming format. This would not just be for theatrical film entertainment, but could include: musical performances, comedy shows, professional seminars, [VR rooms,](https://dreamscapeimmersive.com) educational offerings for schools and universities, NFT galleries, watch-parties for TV shows, film festivals, fairs, co-working spaces, and so many other possibilities- all utilizing the same physical space of a movie theater. What if you could implement a tokenized system of ticketing, instead of USD? Instead of a generic, popcorn-scented lobby with the basic concessions, imagine a multi-use atrium that offered bold flavors like Thai food, Tacos, or Mediterranean. We would also work on partnering with any and all entertainment-related web3 communities to become the official entertainment hub of web3. MovieTheaterDAO hopes to be the de-facto theater where web3-funded films and TV shows host their premieres. We would also be an obvious choice for independent films to host their premieres or show screenings, as we would aim to remove much of the bureaucratic red-tape that usually stands in the way of independent filmmakers. If you are a MovieTheaterDAO member, you will automatically have a screen to share your projects with the world.\n\nImagine all of these possibilities, with the governance of a laser-focused DAO, led by experienced professionals from the entertainment and theatrical industries, web3, and other relevant fields. Wouldn’t this be a far more efficient and equitable way to use the space of a 25k sq. ft multiplex than how they are currently being used? *As a DAO, we will buy and/or develop a movie theater to meet these goals.*\n\n## Why MovieTheaterDAO?\n\nTheaters all across the globe are struggling with [lowered attendance](https://news.gallup.com/poll/388538/movie-theater-attendance-far-below-historical-norms.aspx) and increased overhead costs. The most crucial economic hurdle that the modern theater or multiplex faces isn’t simply the waning demand relative to the growing global entertainment economy, but that the rising cost of real estate for housing one or several screens has become untenable relative to the public’s interest in going to the theater. If the real issue here is space, then the seemingly obvious solution would be to pivot to a different business model that utilizes these enormous retail spaces in a vastly different way during non-prime hours.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IEQzeyF1YrogOxnl5I0kz.png?height=548&width=1124)\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the major theater chains have been unwilling to make drastic changes to this business model. Not only do they fear that radical changes would lead to a more rapid consolidation of their industry, they lack the vision necessary to create the entertainment experience of the future.\n\nThat is why it is on us to fix this broken model and create one that better services our needs, without the baggage that these corporations carry. *The best path forward in achieving this goal is to leverage the utility of web3 community-building and fundraising, with the organizational structure of a DAO to help govern our collective resources. The best path forward is MovieTheaterDAO.*\n\n## Phase 1\n\nWith Phase 1 we will aim to achieve these main goals:\n\n* Build a robust community that will participate in creating our vision and roadmap. This will involve the use of socials like Twitter, Discord, Instagram, and a website.\n* Plan and execute an NFT sale to raise the necessary funds to purchase a multi-year lease of a theater space and to fund the costs of our other concepts for the space, while also building an operating treasury. Compliant with all U.S. securities laws, and on a multi-tiered system, these NFTs will represent token allocation and will count as memberships passes to MovieTheaterDAO and all physical entertainment hubs that we will create.\n* Build a team through our community and source for relevant experts, creating roles that will be compensated through our treasury. Our team will systematically work on projects to be determined by our leaders and our community.\n* Begin process of identifying retail options for our movie theater. We will either identify and focus on a single flagship space, or we will create a concept that we will shop to multiple retail developers. This will have to be in a major urban center in the U.S., most likely Los Angeles but possibly New York, or even Miami. The founder of MovieTheaterDAO has been in talks with a real estate firm representing a recently closed multiplex in the center of Los Angeles, who are in the pre-planning stages of renovating and redesigning the space. We will make community-based decisions on how to approach our retail options, but creating a proposal to bring to the aforementioned space in L.A., or to any specific space that is willing to work with us on a top-to-bottom level, will likely be one of our initial projects.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nJw1wtvC0LfIy9-vtrw89.png?height=509&width=1000)\n\n## Community\n\nWe aren’t just looking for film and entertainment fanatics, but for anyone who is enthusiastic about the potential use-cases for web3 and community-building through the blockchain.

{"id": "MgbIEDywhGTWXppm61Jwm4cH0AZQQq-qLB91Z7OoiyM", "title": "澳洲第一份工作经历", "body": "姐那时候30多岁，刚到澳洲，在一个上市公司做软件测试。公司是那种扁平式构架，我们测试，开发都归一个大经理管，姐是作为测试主管进去的，但没有考核的权力。测试最主要的就是把尽可能的bug在测试阶段发现，如果在客户那里发现本来应该测出的问题，那么作为测试主管，就是罪无可恕了。大经理是个澳洲人，犹太后裔，大概近60岁，老太精神矍铄，身体强壮而高大，胳膊有我小腿粗，脾气算不上温和。我是她招进去的。\n\n姐虽说是主管，但是手下就2个人，都是老员工，根本不听我的，很多工作我只好自己做。我工作还是很卖力的，bug基本难逃我的法眼，大经理对我非常满意，薪水一下子加上去了。但是有一点让我很奇怪，每次我走过她的办公室，都发现大经理会抬头注视我哦很长时间。\n\n姐自认为自己身材保持得不错的，我平时经常锻炼身体，每周基本跑三次步，每次都大汗淋漓。还有，我的臀部特别翘，脱光照镜子，觉得的确如此。于是我还是很自豪的。可能这老太也在欣赏我身材而已。\n\n后来有一次，发生了一件事，让我不得不设法离开这家公司了。\n\n下午快下班的时候，大经理把我叫到她的办公室，然后把门关上。“杰丝，这次现场发现一个问题，属于regression，这个你测试应该能测到的。” 我不禁大吃一惊，回想起来，这个属于自动化测试范畴，但是那天测试环境有些问题，我折腾半天也搞不定，就随便手动测试了下，想不到东窗事发。我脸色变白，只好向她解释了这个经过。她脸色变得铁青，态度严厉起来，“这是严重的渎职，是绝对不允许的。”我吓得站那里不知道怎么办好。可是她突然话锋一转，问道，“你小时候做错过事吗？” 我只好承认我还是犯过错的。“那么你父亲怎么惩罚你呢？” 靠，这个问题让我很难堪，但我还是实话实说了，“打屁股。” “哦，用什么工具打呢？” 这家伙问那么详细干嘛。“用拖鞋的鞋底。”我实话实说。我记得小时候，我很倔强，于是没少挨打，那鞋底的印记，曾一度烙印在我屁股瓣上。这些问答勾起了我的一些回忆。她的脸突然变得兴奋起来，“你这件事情，可大可小，我很看重你，不想让你被公司开除掉，但是你必须接受惩罚。” 当时我刚到澳洲，本地工作经验非常重要，而且当时金融危机，工作非常难找，我不想失去这份工作。于是我表达了我的想法，表示愿接受任何处罚，只要别开除我。 “好的，你在小女孩时候，犯错会被你父亲打屁股，现在你作为一个成年人，更应该被狠狠打屁股，我对你的处罚，就是重打屁股100下。” 啊，我惊呆了，这个实在太羞辱了，看着她高大的身躯，强壮的手臂，我当时居然有种被她狠打屁股的冲动。我的脸涨得通红，低头不语。“你放心，打过后，第一，我希望你以后不要犯类似错误，这次我帮你搪塞过去；第二，这是你我之间事情，走出这个房间的门，我也不会承认任何事情。” 她用严厉的眼神看着我继续说，“你现在回座位上，一小时后你如果走进这个门，就表示你同意了，否则，你可以直接回家去。” 我转身默默离开她的办公室。\n\n这一小时实在太漫长了，我做了激烈的思想斗争。如果不去，会有什么后果，我告她虐待会有什么证据，思前想后，我觉得最好还是委曲求全。澳洲人几乎不加班，一小时过后，办公室里人都走光了，我看到大经理房间里灯还亮着。我怀着惴惴不安的心情走过去，敲门。她打开了门，笑着请我进去。她回头把门锁住，办公室的窗帘也拉上。这样外面根本看不到里面发生的事情。我不安地看看外面。“杰丝，你不用担心，这个办公室是sound proofing 的，窗帘拉上，就算有人来，也看不到里面的事情，现在，把你的裤子脱了，趴我腿上来。” 她坐在那里，拍拍自己大腿。“什么，打光屁股？我不是小女孩了。” 我抗议到。 “作为成年人，你所犯的错误，更应该光着屁股挨打!” 她的声音非常严厉而坚决。我只好解开皮带，褪下裤子，裸出那么一点屁股，然后趴到了她的大腿上，双手撑地。她一下把我的面子撕得粉碎，我的外裤内裤，整个被她拉到了膝盖那里，我还没反应过来，她又把我的体恤高高撩起，这样，我整个腰臀就暴露在她的视线之内。我眼睛一闭，仿佛又成为那个犯错的女孩，光着屁股趴父亲腿上挨打，算了，顺从到底，彻底做一个待宰的羔羊。\n\n“我每打一次，你都要报数，并且说，老板我错了，听见没有？”\n\n“好的。”我应允着。\n\n“啪”，一阵巨疼从我的左边臀部传来。这鬼老太那么粗壮的胳膊不是盖的，估计我的右臀肯定一个大红掌印了，这个思绪还没完，啪一声巨响伴随着巨疼从左边臀瓣上传来，“报数!”一个严厉的声音从上面传过来。我突然惊醒，看来这两下白挨了。啪的一声从右边臀肉传来。\n\n“一，老板我错了！” “啪!” “二，老板我错了！”“啪!” “三，老板我错了!” “啪!”“四，老板我错了!” 疼痛和巨响交替从我的左右屁股传来，我的脑袋一片空白，只知道机械地报数。我以为就这样打一百下，觉得还可以承受。这样左右开弓，我一共数了五十次。她突然停住了。我正诧异，难道她良心发现，放过我了？ “好了，起来吧，双手抱头，到那边站着去，好好反省你的错误。” 我起身，刚想提上裤子👖，“停! 就这样那边站着去!” 她命令道。 我红着脸站到了房间角落，光着屁股，双手抱头。简直太难为情了。但是想到惩罚已经结束，心中不禁窃喜。\n\n我的屁股火辣辣的疼痛，但是毕竟是手掌打出来的，还能接受。这样过了大概五分钟，好漫长啊。我以为这就结束了，正打算感谢她的宽宏大量，没想到我错了。今天这关没这么容易过。处罚的严厉程度远超我的预料。\n\n“趴到桌子边，双手前伸!”她指着那张宽大的老板桌命令。我心里一凉，看来还有啊。我只好慢慢走过去，趴在桌边，双手往前伸。这样我的屁股就翘起，我侧脸朝她望过去，只见她从抽屉里拿出一条红木板子，我认出来了，那是装修的地板，板子一边用布缠绕着，板子表面被打磨得很光滑。我屁股一阵收紧，这个打在肉上，不知道有多疼呢。 她走过来，轻轻抚摸我的两半臀肉，抚摸臀沟地方。 突然，我感觉什么东西被塞进我的肛门。 我刚想用手挡，她说，“这个打得很重，防止你排气！” 我顿时觉得我的屁股被撑爆了。 “不准用手挡，不准踢脚，否则加罚巴掌十记，你只要报数就行。” “Yes, boss!\" 我回答。 “啪!” 我感觉一道火龙撕咬在我右边臀肉上，我疼得几乎跳了起来，但是很快冷静下来，“1”，我咬牙报数。 同时收紧了左臀。“啪!”又是一道火烧的感觉从右边传来，“2”, 我咬紧牙关，看来她打得没有规律，故意让我屈服。我不能，我要像女英雄一样接受惩罚，我收紧整个臀部，感觉肛门那里被撑得更难受了。“啪”，她这次抽打我整个屁股的臀峰处。我握紧拳头。“啪”，这次抽在我屁股大腿交接处，我疼得差点踢脚，大声叫出声来。“啪啪啪啪”， 她的抽打大力而迅速，我几乎要来不及数，屁股也情不自禁扭动起来，估计这个动作刺激了她，因为我感觉接下来的板子打得更重了。“啪”，她突然一下抽在我股沟上，发出清脆的响声，连续抽了好几次，我发现我居然下体发热，难道我天生是受虐狂？红木板子抽打屁股，比巴掌疼数倍。我一下下数着，希望惩罚早些结束。“啪!” “49！”“啪!” “50！” 终于结束了，我整个人都要瘫在桌边了。她走过来，轻抚我的臀部，把肛门塞一下取出来，我顿时觉得一阵轻松。 “起来吧，结束了，你可以回家了，明天休息一天吧。”\n\n我站起身，臀肉像火烧一样，连股沟那里都火辣辣的。我赶忙穿上裤子，双手捂住屁股，说了声谢谢，就一瘸一拐地离开了。 回到家里，我捂着自己的滚烫的屁股，照镜子观察，上面姹紫嫣红，一条条楞子布满臀部，有些地方已经青肿。我趴床上用冷毛巾敷着减轻痛苦。\n\n接下来的几个月，我工作更加卖力，但是还有漏网的鱼。一天，我收到大经理来信，叫我下班先不要走，下班时间后半小时到她办公室去一趟。下班后，我来到她办公室。她把门一关，就咆哮着，“怎么又发生了？这个严重的bug又在客户那里发生了!” 我看了看描述，这个我应该测过的呀。我努力回忆着，想起来了，这个问题，在 rc1 上测过，然后我发现了另外的问题，于是开发者又发布了rc2，然后在这个版本，我认为不会有那个问题，所以就没去测。这的确是我的过错。我跟她解释了这个，然后把心一横，说道，“我愿意受罚，你打我屁股吧。”\n\n她冷笑一声，从抽屉里取出一根拇指粗的藤条，一端用红布包着。这还不算，又取出了几根麻绳。我看着这些，心惊胆颤。\n\n“把衣服脱光，就内裤留下，然后趴到我腿上来。” 没办法，我只得照办。仅穿一条红色内裤趴在她腿上，她轻抚着我的背，我的腰臀，突然，我感觉屁股一凉，她迅速地，突然地把我的内裤扒了下来，这样我就整个光屁股露在她面前了，对此我习以为常了，也没用手阻拦，我双手撑地，两瓣臀肉收紧，准备迎接她的浑厚有力的巴掌。但是她没有，她轻轻抚摸我的屁股瓣，抚摸我臀腿交接地方，在我慢慢放松臀肉的时候，她突然把一根手指插进我的肛门。对此我非常反感。我夹紧屁股，阻止她的插入。换来的是猛烈的巴掌，这次她也没叫我报数，就是那么猛烈地左右开弓，我左右两边屁股传来像是爆炸一般的声音，火辣辣地疼痛。我一声不吭。她就打得更加凶狠。接着她又对我的臀部靠近肛门处猛烈抽打，对我的股沟也进行了拷打。这让我产生了一些生理反应，我怀疑她看到我的水了，就加大对那些地方的拷打，我努力克制自己，并紧双腿，收紧臀肉。我感觉屁股上面火烧的一片。我有时候偷偷回头看时，只见老太的粗壮的胳膊高高举起，那胳膊上肉疙瘩一块块的，上面毛茸茸的，她的巴掌巨大，结实有力，几乎能覆盖我大半边屁股，见它落下时，我闭上了眼睛，收紧臀部肌肉，然后屁股上就发出巨响，伴随着一阵剧痛。\n\n大约打了五十来下，我想这是开胃菜。她让我站起来，然后趴到桌边。我心想，这才是正餐。她把我的腿绑在桌腿上，这样我的双腿就不由自主张开了，后门大开，她把我的双手捆绑在一起，前伸后固定在桌子另外一边，用一根麻绳拦腰捆在桌子上。这样我整个人就没法动弹了。我内心感到非常无助，不知道怎么办好。她走过来，轻轻抚摸我的双臀，我的腰臀，然后她用力掰开我的双股，把一个大号的肛塞塞进了我的身体，我觉得整个屁股都要裂开了。想收紧臀部，但是感觉更涨得慌。她把那根藤条持在手里，上下挥舞了几下，在空气中发出嗖嗖的声音。我由于恐惧而夹紧了我的屁股。啪的一声巨响，藤条在我右边屁股上炸开，那感觉简直生不如死。我还没来得及消化这次鞭打，啪的一声，左边屁股传来巨疼，我忍不住屁股扭动起来，但是根本逃脱不掉，我终于明白她为什么把我捆得那么结实了。啪，藤条抽过我整个屁股上，犹如火龙撕咬一般，我大声喊叫出来。啪啪啪啪，藤条连续抽过我的臀腿交接地方，我的臀缝，我的大腿，我努力挣扎，腰臀剧烈扭动，大口喘气，大汗淋漓，却无计可施。这个世界就是这么残酷，弱小的只能被捆得结结实实，光屁股在这里忍受藤条的抽打! 这也是人生最重要的一节课。不知道打了多少下，她停住了，我能感受她的气喘吁吁，可见她费了多大力气抽打，她慢慢按摩我的双臀，猛地把肛塞也拔了出来，我感觉一阵轻松。她贴在我的背后，我感觉她的呼吸非常沉重，她的手不断抚摸我阴道附近，和我臀腿交接的屁股瓣。我感觉她拿什么东西顶住了我的屁股，我夹紧臀肉，坚决不许。“不要这样，我要报警的!”\n\n她没得逞，愤怒地打开抽屉，又拿出一样刑具，短木棍，我能看出来这个有些像擀面杖，应该很结实的。她提起那根木棍，照着我本来已经伤痕累累的两瓣屁股狠打，“啪啪啪啪!”我简直要疼晕过去了，屁股不断扭动试图逃避那木棍的肆虐，却无济于事，木棍准确地落在我的屁股上发出清脆的响声，我大声嚎叫，不停求饶。她再次拔出她的小短棍，顶住我的肛门，可是我仍旧不屈服。万般无奈，她只好放弃，又抽打了数十下发泄一下，我疼得直咧嘴，觉得屁股要被她打成四瓣了。她解开绳子，放我走了。我穿上衣裤，捂着生疼的屁股，一声不响离开了。\n\n这次之后，我知道告了她也没有用，因为很难取证，反而把我自己名声弄臭了。我决定抛弃幻想，努力重新找工作，白天上班，晚上练习各种面试题目，经济不算好，所以我找了三个月，终于经过两轮面试，找到了新东家，薪水比现在还高了2万至3万澳元。这三个月，对我也是煎熬，她经常把我叫到她办公室，找各种理由对我的屁股进行拷打。\n\n终于有一天，她找我进办公室的时候，我给了她辞呈。她看着我，什么也没说，让我走吧。一个月后，我离开了这家公司，开始了我在澳洲崭新的工作和生活。", "timestamp": 1657150081, "digest": "wTBsnuTJ4u-OpuGF-dJ2qHV1QLrAVI5lsSYwAfd6JJ8", "contributor": "0x42083FD0B13BbfaE34554719367dBe2A2fcE707f"}
{"id": "RWtNV9rG-C51f1YqoTVEqtAnU8lY2a8X5a9jthvICJY", "title": "澳洲第一份工作经历", "body": "姐那时候30多岁，刚到澳洲，在一个上市公司做软件测试。公司是那种扁平式构架，我们测试，开发都归一个大经理管，姐是作为测试主管进去的，但没有考核的权力。测试最主要的就是把尽可能的bug在测试阶段发现，如果在客户那里发现本来应该测出的问题，那么作为测试主管，就是罪无可恕了。大经理是个澳洲人，犹太后裔，大概近60岁，老太精神矍铄，身体强壮而高大，胳膊有我小腿粗，脾气算不上温和。我是她招进去的。\n\n姐虽说是主管，但是手下就2个人，都是老员工，根本不听我的，很多工作我只好自己做。我工作还是很卖力的，bug基本难逃我的法眼，大经理对我非常满意，薪水一下子加上去了。但是有一点让我很奇怪，每次我走过她的办公室，都发现大经理会抬头注视我哦很长时间。\n\n姐自认为自己身材保持得不错的，我平时经常锻炼身体，每周基本跑三次步，每次都大汗淋漓。还有，我的臀部特别翘，脱光照镜子，觉得的确如此。于是我还是很自豪的。可能这老太也在欣赏我身材而已。\n\n后来有一次，发生了一件事，让我不得不设法离开这家公司了。\n\n下午快下班的时候，大经理把我叫到她的办公室，然后把门关上。“杰丝，这次现场发现一个问题，属于regression，这个你测试应该能测到的。” 我不禁大吃一惊，回想起来，这个属于自动化测试范畴，但是那天测试环境有些问题，我折腾半天也搞不定，就随便手动测试了下，想不到东窗事发。我脸色变白，只好向她解释了这个经过。她脸色变得铁青，态度严厉起来，“这是严重的渎职，是绝对不允许的。”我吓得站那里不知道怎么办好。可是她突然话锋一转，问道，“你小时候做错过事吗？” 我只好承认我还是犯过错的。“那么你父亲怎么惩罚你呢？” 靠，这个问题让我很难堪，但我还是实话实说了，“打屁股。” “哦，用什么工具打呢？” 这家伙问那么详细干嘛。“用拖鞋的鞋底。”我实话实说。我记得小时候，我很倔强，于是没少挨打，那鞋底的印记，曾一度烙印在我屁股瓣上。这些问答勾起了我的一些回忆。她的脸突然变得兴奋起来，“你这件事情，可大可小，我很看重你，不想让你被公司开除掉，但是你必须接受惩罚。” 当时我刚到澳洲，本地工作经验非常重要，而且当时金融危机，工作非常难找，我不想失去这份工作。于是我表达了我的想法，表示愿接受任何处罚，只要别开除我。 “好的，你在小女孩时候，犯错会被你父亲打屁股，现在你作为一个成年人，更应该被狠狠打屁股，我对你的处罚，就是重打屁股100下。” 啊，我惊呆了，这个实在太羞辱了，看着她高大的身躯，强壮的手臂，我当时居然有种被她狠打屁股的冲动。我的脸涨得通红，低头不语。“你放心，打过后，第一，我希望你以后不要犯类似错误，这次我帮你搪塞过去；第二，这是你我之间事情，走出这个房间的门，我也不会承认任何事情。” 她用严厉的眼神看着我继续说，“你现在回座位上，一小时后你如果走进这个门，就表示你同意了，否则，你可以直接回家去。” 我转身默默离开她的办公室。\n\n这一小时实在太漫长了，我做了激烈的思想斗争。如果不去，会有什么后果，我告她虐待会有什么证据，思前想后，我觉得最好还是委曲求全。澳洲人几乎不加班，一小时过后，办公室里人都走光了，我看到大经理房间里灯还亮着。我怀着惴惴不安的心情走过去，敲门。她打开了门，笑着请我进去。她回头把门锁住，办公室的窗帘也拉上。这样外面根本看不到里面发生的事情。我不安地看看外面。“杰丝，你不用担心，这个办公室是sound proofing 的，窗帘拉上，就算有人来，也看不到里面的事情，现在，把你的裤子脱了，趴我腿上来。” 她坐在那里，拍拍自己大腿。“什么，打光屁股？我不是小女孩了。” 我抗议到。 “作为成年人，你所犯的错误，更应该光着屁股挨打!” 她的声音非常严厉而坚决。我只好解开皮带，褪下裤子，裸出那么一点屁股，然后趴到了她的大腿上，双手撑地。她一下把我的面子撕得粉碎，我的外裤内裤，整个被她拉到了膝盖那里，我还没反应过来，她又把我的体恤高高撩起，这样，我整个腰臀就暴露在她的视线之内。我眼睛一闭，仿佛又成为那个犯错的女孩，光着屁股趴父亲腿上挨打，算了，顺从到底，彻底做一个待宰的羔羊。\n\n“我每打一次，你都要报数，并且说，老板我错了，听见没有？”\n\n“好的。”我应允着。\n\n“啪”，一阵巨疼从我的左边臀部传来。这鬼老太那么粗壮的胳膊不是盖的，估计我的右臀肯定一个大红掌印了，这个思绪还没完，啪一声巨响伴随着巨疼从左边臀瓣上传来，“报数!”一个严厉的声音从上面传过来。我突然惊醒，看来这两下白挨了。啪的一声从右边臀肉传来。\n\n“一，老板我错了！” “啪!” “二，老板我错了！”“啪!” “三，老板我错了!” “啪!”“四，老板我错了!” 疼痛和巨响交替从我的左右屁股传来，我的脑袋一片空白，只知道机械地报数。我以为就这样打一百下，觉得还可以承受。这样左右开弓，我一共数了五十次。她突然停住了。我正诧异，难道她良心发现，放过我了？ “好了，起来吧，双手抱头，到那边站着去，好好反省你的错误。” 我起身，刚想提上裤子👖，“停! 就这样那边站着去!” 她命令道。 我红着脸站到了房间角落，光着屁股，双手抱头。简直太难为情了。但是想到惩罚已经结束，心中不禁窃喜。\n\n我的屁股火辣辣的疼痛，但是毕竟是手掌打出来的，还能接受。这样过了大概五分钟，好漫长啊。我以为这就结束了，正打算感谢她的宽宏大量，没想到我错了。今天这关没这么容易过。处罚的严厉程度远超我的预料。\n\n“趴到桌子边，双手前伸!”她指着那张宽大的老板桌命令。我心里一凉，看来还有啊。我只好慢慢走过去，趴在桌边，双手往前伸。这样我的屁股就翘起，我侧脸朝她望过去，只见她从抽屉里拿出一条红木板子，我认出来了，那是装修的地板，板子一边用布缠绕着，板子表面被打磨得很光滑。我屁股一阵收紧，这个打在肉上，不知道有多疼呢。 她走过来，轻轻抚摸我的两半臀肉，抚摸臀沟地方。 突然，我感觉什么东西被塞进我的肛门。 我刚想用手挡，她说，“这个打得很重，防止你排气！” 我顿时觉得我的屁股被撑爆了。 “不准用手挡，不准踢脚，否则加罚巴掌十记，你只要报数就行。” “Yes, boss!\" 我回答。 “啪!” 我感觉一道火龙撕咬在我右边臀肉上，我疼得几乎跳了起来，但是很快冷静下来，“1”，我咬牙报数。 同时收紧了左臀。“啪!”又是一道火烧的感觉从右边传来，“2”, 我咬紧牙关，看来她打得没有规律，故意让我屈服。我不能，我要像女英雄一样接受惩罚，我收紧整个臀部，感觉肛门那里被撑得更难受了。“啪”，她这次抽打我整个屁股的臀峰处。我握紧拳头。“啪”，这次抽在我屁股大腿交接处，我疼得差点踢脚，大声叫出声来。“啪啪啪啪”， 她的抽打大力而迅速，我几乎要来不及数，屁股也情不自禁扭动起来，估计这个动作刺激了她，因为我感觉接下来的板子打得更重了。“啪”，她突然一下抽在我股沟上，发出清脆的响声，连续抽了好几次，我发现我居然下体发热，难道我天生是受虐狂？红木板子抽打屁股，比巴掌疼数倍。我一下下数着，希望惩罚早些结束。“啪!” “49！”“啪!” “50！” 终于结束了，我整个人都要瘫在桌边了。她走过来，轻抚我的臀部，把肛门塞一下取出来，我顿时觉得一阵轻松。 “起来吧，结束了，你可以回家了，明天休息一天吧。”\n\n我站起身，臀肉像火烧一样，连股沟那里都火辣辣的。我赶忙穿上裤子，双手捂住屁股，说了声谢谢，就一瘸一拐地离开了。 回到家里，我捂着自己的滚烫的屁股，照镜子观察，上面姹紫嫣红，一条条楞子布满臀部，有些地方已经青肿。我趴床上用冷毛巾敷着减轻痛苦。\n\n接下来的几个月，我工作更加卖力，但是还有漏网的鱼。一天，我收到大经理来信，叫我下班先不要走，下班时间后半小时到她办公室去一趟。下班后，我来到她办公室。她把门一关，就咆哮着，“怎么又发生了？这个严重的bug又在客户那里发生了!” 我看了看描述，这个我应该测过的呀。我努力回忆着，想起来了，这个问题，在 rc1 上测过，然后我发现了另外的问题，于是开发者又发布了rc2，然后在这个版本，我认为不会有那个问题，所以就没去测。这的确是我的过错。我跟她解释了这个，然后把心一横，说道，“我愿意受罚，你打我屁股吧。”\n\n她冷笑一声，从抽屉里取出一根拇指粗的藤条，一端用红布包着。这还不算，又取出了几根麻绳。我看着这些，心惊胆颤。\n\n“把衣服脱光，就内裤留下，然后趴到我腿上来。” 没办法，我只得照办。仅穿一条红色内裤趴在她腿上，她轻抚着我的背，我的腰臀，突然，我感觉屁股一凉，她迅速地，突然地把我的内裤扒了下来，这样我就整个光屁股露在她面前了，对此我习以为常了，也没用手阻拦，我双手撑地，两瓣臀肉收紧，准备迎接她的浑厚有力的巴掌。但是她没有，她轻轻抚摸我的屁股瓣，抚摸我臀腿交接地方，在我慢慢放松臀肉的时候，她突然把一根手指插进我的肛门。对此我非常反感。我夹紧屁股，阻止她的插入。换来的是猛烈的巴掌，这次她也没叫我报数，就是那么猛烈地左右开弓，我左右两边屁股传来像是爆炸一般的声音，火辣辣地疼痛。我一声不吭。她就打得更加凶狠。接着她又对我的臀部靠近肛门处猛烈抽打，对我的股沟也进行了拷打。这让我产生了一些生理反应，我怀疑她看到我的水了，就加大对那些地方的拷打，我努力克制自己，并紧双腿，收紧臀肉。我感觉屁股上面火烧的一片。我有时候偷偷回头看时，只见老太的粗壮的胳膊高高举起，那胳膊上肉疙瘩一块块的，上面毛茸茸的，她的巴掌巨大，结实有力，几乎能覆盖我大半边屁股，见它落下时，我闭上了眼睛，收紧臀部肌肉，然后屁股上就发出巨响，伴随着一阵剧痛。\n\n大约打了五十来下，我想这是开胃菜。她让我站起来，然后趴到桌边。我心想，这才是正餐。她把我的腿绑在桌腿上，这样我的双腿就不由自主张开了，后门大开，她把我的双手捆绑在一起，前伸后固定在桌子另外一边，用一根麻绳拦腰捆在桌子上。这样我整个人就没法动弹了。我内心感到非常无助，不知道怎么办好。她走过来，轻轻抚摸我的双臀，我的腰臀，然后她用力掰开我的双股，把一个大号的肛塞塞进了我的身体，我觉得整个屁股都要裂开了。想收紧臀部，但是感觉更涨得慌。她把那根藤条持在手里，上下挥舞了几下，在空气中发出嗖嗖的声音。我由于恐惧而夹紧了我的屁股。啪的一声巨响，藤条在我右边屁股上炸开，那感觉简直生不如死。我还没来得及消化这次鞭打，啪的一声，左边屁股传来巨疼，我忍不住屁股扭动起来，但是根本逃脱不掉，我终于明白她为什么把我捆得那么结实了。啪，藤条抽过我整个屁股上，犹如火龙撕咬一般，我大声喊叫出来。啪啪啪啪，藤条连续抽过我的臀腿交接地方，我的臀缝，我的大腿，我努力挣扎，腰臀剧烈扭动，大口喘气，大汗淋漓，却无计可施。这个世界就是这么残酷，弱小的只能被捆得结结实实，光屁股在这里忍受藤条的抽打!

{"id": "-zr1sbTogpu3qEPKABpkqQk0TOoRHJUCwZOk6nA8yQI", "title": "How to go from 0 to 7k+ followers real quick on twitter.", "body": "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1184/0\\*UTwLZEK_Z5TsHjUj.jpg)\n\nI went from 0 to 7k+ followers on Crypto Twitter in 1 month. Here’s how you can do so too.\n\n**How to get started**\n\nThink over your interests in crypto. What do you like? NFTs? DeFi? Gaming? Start with your interests. Think about your strengths & skills. Are you a college student? Lawyer? Realtor? Writer? Whatever your skills & interests are, there is a place for you\n\nThink over it, combine your skills and interests? Gamer + lawyer? Write about crypto gaming law. College student NFT enthusiast? Write about buying NFTs when your broke.\n\nI spent a whole month writing & posting but got 0 traction, me being consistent regardless was key.\n\n**Consistency is key.**\n\nWhen you’re just starting out, you need to produce content every day or close to every day to grow quickly. Consistency trumps just about every else. You do not have to post long form content everyday, be creative.\n\nPost collections of resources, summarize an article/thread you just read, shitpost. You’re probably not gonna get all that many views or likes, but you need to be consistent regardless.\n\n**Experimentation is important**.\n\nOne of the most important things you have to do is experimentation. When you’re small no one knows you. No one knows what value you bring. YOU don’t know what value you bring yet. Experiment with different writing styles and topics.\n\nFinding your writer/market fit is key to grow, but for that to happen you need to try out a bunch of things. I spent the first month trying out a bunch of different things — I wrote threads on more general topics, collected resources, made guides.\n\nMy 101s stuck and made me grow. Without me experimenting for a whole month, I would not have found it. However, that’s not it, I am still experimenting, still trying to find my fit.\n\nObviously, producing quality is key. Read whitepapers, a lot of them are not as intimidating or hard to understand as they seem.\n\n**Follow a bunch of great writers**\n\nFollow the best writers, there are a ton. Look at how they write & structure things. Reading a lot goes hand in hand with this. Read from great writers, there are so many.\n\nFollow newsletters & TG groups that summarize key events. Daily ape, Milk Road, Bankless are some of my favs. Take from these legit people.\n\n**Hustle for eyeballs.**\n\nWhen you’re small, growing is hard af. The first 100 took me a long time. You need to hustle for eyeballs. There are a couple of ways that I did this. I tag a bunch of relevant people at the end of my threads.\n\nI’ve read these people’s content when I was researching the topic. I want to shout them out + use their help to get visibility. It’s a win win.\n\nI DMed a lot of relevant people my threads and ask them to retweet if they found it cool.\n\nPost your threads in relevant groups, send it to people, comment it where relevant. There are many ways to do this. Be creative and experiment.\n\nWriting about what’s getting all the hype and buzz really helps. When there’s a lot of hype, people want good content surrounding that topic. Look at Twitter hashtags & tools like Lunarcrush to see what’s trending.\n\n**Writing is useful for everyone in crypto.**\n\nIf you’re a dev or designer, there’s probably a lot of demand already, in the right places. But, if you’re just starting out ( or even if you’re not) writing is a great way to make a name for yourself and gain visibility.\n\nTwitter & your content act as your resume.\n\nIf you’re a dev with a decent following + good rep, you’re going to get way more offers + money than someone without. Just because when they think of devs, your name will pop up first into their heads.\n\nIt’s really good for connections & meeting people. If you’re not a technical person, writing is probably the best thing to do.\n\n**Twitter DMs**\n\nTwitter DMs and comments are a great way to connect with people. People love personal connections here. Constantly comment and interact with people you like, they’ll see you & start to recognize you. DMs are super great.\n\nAsk questions, have discussions, ask for feedback on your work. Just have a conversion with people. It’s a great way to meet really cool people, get involved with cool projects and get feedback.\n\nJust DM. Also, don’t be a clown like me. Twitter DMs are off by default.\n\n**Some Inspiration**\n\nInspiration. Some of you guys asked for inspiration on writing.\n\nThis is how I view it. Writing and growing your Twitter is probably one of the best ROI activities in crypto. There is immense opportunity on crypto twitter to gain visibility, build cool stuff and make money.\n\nThink about it, some of the biggest, most influential people in web3 have like 200k followers — Darren Lau, Punk 6259, etc\n\nThis is because CT is incredibly small. The biggest people only have 200k followers. The biggest people in all other spaces have millions.\n\nCT is not saturated.\n\nThere is a lot of room for good content. People are very eager to follow those who produce good content. The upside is astronomical. Everyone is hiring. How do you distinguish yourself from everyone else? By having a twitter with good content.\n\nEveryone who is hiring in web3 is on twitter. If they see you produce good content, they will instantly offer you a job. It’s your web3 resume. They’ll already know you’re legit. I got 8+ job offers since starting out in Feb. You’ll earn way more here.\n\nThere is so much opportunity to build. Write now, grow now. The coolest people will reach out to you. Writing connects you to so many things and people. If you already have a sizeable name & rep, when mass adoption happens you’ll explode.\n\nHowever this is time sensitive.\n\nEventually, as more people come in and write, it’ll become super difficult to grow.

{"id": "uC4qa-nY32cRCmVwCeZNwSExGFkFtBFvy0hZvyf62uc", "title": "男房东与女房客", "body": "自从搬到了现在这个大房子以后，我原先的小别墅就租给了来自马来西亚的一对母子，资料上说母亲大概是37岁，名字叫杰丝，是一家软件公司的主管，看护照照片上还算个美女；儿子17岁，正好在房子附近的大学读预科。这可能就是学区房的好处，容易租出去。付清押金和第一个月的租金后，她们母子就入住了，一开始时候有些小问题，我还去修过几次，比如灯泡坏了，烟雾报警器需要更换啊，有两次我去的时候，会在门口听见噼噼啪啪的声音，然后我按门铃后很久杰丝才出来开门，她就一个人在家，脸色潮红，当时我没在意，然后路过书房时候，随便瞄一眼，发现书房的凳子上有一把那种塑料的刷沙发的大刷子，我也没在意。修好东西后，我就跟杰丝随便聊聊，她是马来西亚华人，可惜中文实在不咋地，于是我们基本英语聊，她在公司做测试主管，据说那家公司挺乱，手下人根本不听她的，随便什么软件，测试总是通过的，然后经常在客户那里出现bug，然后她就被大领导叫到办公室去训一通，我当时一笑说，\"Oh, you will be harshly spanked（你要被狠狠打屁股了）。\" 我随便说说，她当时脸就变得通红了。问她老公是不是在国内奋斗呢，她哼了一声，说自己早离婚了，她老公对家里从来不负责，把儿子都丢给她了。\n\n时隔大半年，我突然有一次收到council，就是澳洲的地方政府委员会的来信，说按照法律第几条，我门口的草长超过了20cm，必须在几号前剪掉，不然就要罚款2000刀，我大吃一惊，因为之前我散步路过那里，看到草长得太长，我跟租房中介说过，要中介跟杰丝说除草的事情，怎么还没除呢。而且时间非常紧迫，我就打电话给中介，中介说一时联系不上租客，我说这样吧，我自己周末去看看，如果还没除草，我就自己除，但是我要收费的，因为租房合约上写的除草是租客的责任。于是我周末跑过去了，果然，前花园满地的草，茂盛无比，我感到很气愤，前面中介都通知过你了。于是我敲门，杰丝出来了，我跟她说明情况，她很抱歉地说，“对不起，我前面太忙了， 刚刚换了个工作。” 我说好的，那我来替你除草，你应该收到中介的信的。我于是搬出准备好的除草机，大概干了一个小时，除完草，全部装进我带来的塑料袋里。我跟杰丝说，“好了，中介跟你说过收费的事情吧。”她说还没看邮件呢。我有些生气，随便说了声，“你真该被狠狠打屁股啊”。她的脸又红了。跟我说进屋谈吧。进屋之后，她表示太抱歉了，害得我差点被罚款，作为租客，实在不应该。她上一家公司管理太混乱了，bug不断出现在客户那里，她根本控制不了，这是系统性的问题，整个公司人都在混日子，她觉得实在难做，决定跳槽了，刚换了新工作，新的东西要学，还要带孩子，感觉很辛苦，说着说着她哭了，她父亲又刚刚去世，现在又换工作，所以她经常忘记事情。说小时候父亲对她特别严格，导致她一直压力很大，她小时候犯了错误，父亲就要用皮带狠狠抽她屁股，现在父亲去世了，想要他老人家打屁股都不行了。她哭得很伤心。我一下子愣住了，不知道说什么好，就说，\"要不我帮帮你？\" 她抬头看看我，居然点了点头，说，“好吧，这次除草的事情，我能不能就这样赎罪？” 这句话引起了我的感觉，我观察一下她，穿着休闲裤有些紧绷，短袖t恤，虽然年纪37了，但是身材相当不错，臀部浑圆，胸部饱满，这样的成熟的女白领人被打屁股，还是蛮刺激的。 看我在犹豫，她叹了口气，悠悠说到，“看来我年纪太大了，您不要勉强了。” 我也算是sp圈内人士，结婚生子后一直就不碰了，这次把我内心潜伏了多年的欲望挑起来了，我把心一横，把脸坂起来，认真地说，“我知道你年龄，年纪再大，你犯了错误，还是要被狠狠地打屁股！” 她眼睛一亮，随着把头低下去了。我这时候突然想起上次进门前的啪啪声音，以及我进门路过书房后看到的塑料刷子，我顿时一切都明白了，她那时候在DIY呢，看来她也是这方面的圈内人，也难怪，一个离婚女子，工作压力那么大，还要抚养孩子，她又是一个高级白领，当然不愿意出去乱找人，就需要这个来减轻自己的压力。我问她是不是去书房，她点点头，看来我猜对了。我们一前一后，我在前，到了书房，里面就一张桌子，桌上有台笔记本电脑，然后有一张不带扶手的凳子，我周围看了下，担心有什么摄像头，应该没有，于是我把凳子搬到书房中间，坐在上面，严肃地说，“你自己去把工具拿过来！”她打开书桌的一个抽屉，拿出一个刷子，正面就是刷子，反面是油光锃亮的塑料[板子](https://amzn.to/339moNz)，非常适合打屁股，她双手把刑具递给我，我拿在手里掂掂分量，还是蛮重的，上次我来的时候，估计她就是用这个DIY的。我左手握住板子，拍打了下右手，发出“啪啪”的声音，然后严肃地指了指我的大腿，“趴到我腿上来。“ 她的脸因为羞涩而涨得通红，咬着嘴唇，趴到了我的腿上，双手撑地。我一手按住她的腰，一手持板子，问道，”你觉得打几板子可以赎罪？“ 她不啃声，我怒道，”一个成年女子，犯了错误，我对你的惩罚必须比小女孩更加严厉，今天打你100板子绝不过分！“她默默地应承了。说罢，我一[板子](https://amzn.to/2xuC0Q3)就向她崛起的右臀抽过去了，她身子一震，接着左臀，没有一点保留，我使了全部力道，每一板子都绝不放水，这样一连打了约20板子，她臀部开始左右扭动着躲避，这让我更加兴奋，索性把她的裤子拉了下来，她穿的松紧裤，很容易就拉下来了，她不由自主地用手来挡，我就把她的手按在她的腰上，然后一不做二不休，把她内裤也拉到膝盖那里，停顿片刻，体验一下她无助的挣扎，然后用板子使劲地抽打在光屁股上，左右开攻，”啪啪“声回荡在书房里，伴随着她的呻吟声，她的臀部的扭动挣扎，我感觉自己那里硬了起来，于是定住心神，继续抽打，sp的处罚要避免情色因素，这是非常严肃的，严厉的处罚，尤其对这样的女白领，她们需要的就是严厉的处罚，从而得到心灵的解脱。打了约60板子，我停了停，开始训话，”你觉得该不该打，今天我一定会更加让你屁股开花，得到实实在在的教训！“\n\n说完我继续左右开弓，板子抽打在 她的臀峰上，臀肉像波浪一样凹进凸出，然后我打在臀腿交界处，她疼得并进了臀部肌肉，我观察到她的私处水淋淋的，她把双腿夹得紧紧的，承受每一次重罚。我用右腿把她的两条腿一起夹住，这样她的圆润饱满的屁股就 呈现在我眼前，我用巴掌用力打了10几下，她似乎放松下来，然后我突然用起了板子继续抽打，板子抽在她的光屁股上，她的屁股由开始的白皙，变成现在的红中带紫。100板子对她来说是那么漫长，由于疼痛难受，她甚至不顾一开始的淑女形象了，拼命挣扎，连头发都凌乱了，甚至开口求饶，\"I am sorry, please be merciful!（对不起，请打得轻点） \" 我丝毫不给她任何放水的妄想，想到这个已经为人人母的女子，像一个小女孩一样，光着屁股在我的板子下呻吟，感觉简直好极了，如果她儿子看到自己的母亲被一个陌生人这样狠狠地打屁股，不知道作何感想。于是我板子打得更加严厉。不知不觉，100板子打完了。我用手给她的臀部按摩了一会，感觉到滚烫一片，看来这次打得够狠。我感觉我按摩的时候 ，她的私处流出的水更多了，我心神有所荡漾，但是忍住了。过了一会，我问她需要冷敷吗？她说算了，想让疼痛的感觉延续长一些，记住教训。在我离开的时候，她的眼睛水汪汪地看着我，似乎意犹未尽，有什么话要跟我说，我也是成年人了，明白她想什么，但是道德还是约束了我，我跟她说，”下次有什么事情再找我吧。“ 然后头也不回地走了。\n\n又过了大约三个月，中介打电话给我说上次inspection租客那边很乱，建议了她好好整理下，我听了后，对中介的工作表示认可，然后说我打算去跟杰丝谈谈。约好了一个周六上午，我又见到了杰丝，跟她说起Inspection的事情，她说前一阵子正好回了趟马来西亚，所以房间里都没整理，我正打算原谅了她，她突然话锋一转，说：“即便如此，我觉得也是不能原谅的，处罚还是必须的，我以后不会让这样事情发生，临走之前一定要整理干净。” 我点头表示赞许她这种态度。她看着我，说：“要不又要麻烦您，对我进行处罚了。” 我说：“我很乐意。” 心里很美，她今天穿了件连衣短裙，把她的细腰丰臀存托得非常迷人。她走在前，我走在后，心里想，“这丰臀今天我一定把她打开花，让她得到实实在在的教训。” 来到书房，这里几乎成了刑讯室了，我照例坐在凳子上，这次我直接把她拉到我的腿上，把她的短裙一下拉起来，内裤直接褪下来，裸出光屁股，她大吃一惊，尽管知道打光屁股是不可避免，但是没想到一上来就这样，于是她本能用手去阻拦，我就索性把她的手按在她的蜂腰上，当时我有些惊讶，因为我发现她的臀部似乎近期挨过打，有些红红的巴掌印，但是我没有去深究（我将在“杰丝儿子的日记”中来说明这个事情）。\n\n接着，我抡圆了巴掌，用力打在她的右边屁股上，当时臀肉上就 一片红了，她身躯微微一震，眉头紧锁，接下来我一巴掌打在她的左边臀瓣上，又是一片红，如此像抽打耳光一样，左右开弓，打了约30巴掌，她开始踢脚，来减缓屁股上的疼痛。我就像上次一样，用右腿把她的两条腿固定住，这样她整个丰满的臀部就暴露在我眼前，我更加凶猛地抽打她的两半屁股，并且故意对准她的屁股大腿交界地方猛抽，我看到她的私密处很多水流出来了，看来她是真的sp爱好者，猛烈的抽打，让她起了生理反应，她估计怕被我看见，两腿夹得紧紧的，但是我还是对准那个附近猛抽，我甚至能看到液体沿着她的大腿流了下来，我于是用手抚摸她的臀肉，把手指划过她的私处，她似乎并不拒绝，而且把臀部耸起配合着。我没有进一步的行动。让她站起身来，把裤子穿好。我也站起来，然后命令她去房间拿个枕头来，过了一会儿，她抱着枕头来了。我命令她把枕头竖着放桌子边沿上，然后小腹趴上面，她照做，这样，一个白领丽人趴在桌子边沿，屁股高高撅起，我先抚摸了一阵子，然后解下我的皮带，抡圆了胳膊，一记抽过她的整个屁股，一条红痕像烈火一样划过她的两半臀肉，她浑身抖了下，这条火龙不断撕咬她整个丰臀，她的屁股开始左右扭动去躲避，但是我抽打得更加大力。抽打大约40几下，我扔掉皮带，抚摸她的臀部，从腰到右侧屁股，然后是左侧屁股，抚摸到两个丰满的臀瓣，臀腿交界地方，大腿根，然后我的手指划过她的已经潮湿的沼泽地，她身体微微颤抖，我用手指在那里打圈，她开始轻声呻吟起来，“Take me please!” 她开始失去控制。我的下半身变得火热，感觉那里已经硬如铁了，这么一个丰满丽人在我面前发出这种我难以拒绝的请求，我怎可回避呢？我脱掉裤子，戴上[套](https://amzn.to/3cSDX9k)（是的，来之前我考虑过这个可能性），从背后插入了她的身体，因为那里早已潮湿，非常润滑，所以我很顺利就进入了，她的身体里是火热的，把我包裹得紧紧的，这种感觉真好，我两手扶住她的腰臀，用力地抽插，如同我刚才用巴掌和皮带用力抽打她的丰臀一样，我用的的另外一个棍棒在她的屁股里面“重打40大板”，我一边抽插，一边用巴掌用力击打她两瓣臀肉，我的手绕过她的腋下去抚摸她的坚挺的乳房，她的两个乳头已经非常坚硬，如此这般，她忍不住大声呻吟，我于是抽插得更加猛烈，打屁股也更加用力。最后一股热浪进入套中，我们结束了这次打屁股的处罚。临走前，我们交换了电话和email。她恋恋不舍地让我离开了。", "timestamp": 1657151679, "digest": "-sqb0D3SBkjE29ypbd7P831fehQVjYG-hfnH0fXQqso", "contributor": "0x42083FD0B13BbfaE34554719367dBe2A2fcE707f"}

It's time to wake up.", "body": "*What we see on NFTs collections current business models.*\n\nWritten by: [@0xmdh](https://twitter.com/0xmdh)\n\nRecently, we were analyzing last year’s NFT collections. We also talked with some startups that are building in the NFT ecosystem. Here you will find some of the things we’ve been openly discussing.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MwkvlE0gDFGIRKSldN-OF.jpg?height=2626&width=5001)\n\nLast year, we saw startups making money by selling NFT collections across time. As a short-term goal, most of them achieved the sold-out.\n\nOn the other hand, as a long-term goal, it was not really successful. Floor prices decreased significantly, active addresses declined, and new users did not arrive. To sustain the expectations of NFT Holders, the collections promised future improvements, staking artificial rewards and/or subsequent collections airdrops, among other perks.\n\nTherefore, if nobody was really using it, there was no organic reason to print more of something in the NFT market.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HKsq59XsnKdWuQxWud-ac.gif?height=400&width=480)\n\nWhat can you do as an NFT Collection startup if you want to survive?\n\n1. **Stop selling new collections; you need to create scarcity.**\n   New collections will only add more and more NFTs to the market, but you won't be actually helping the demand. Instead, the supply will be increased, causing oversupply.\n2. **Create utility.**\n   What does your collection have to offer as a differential? You may want to find some use-cases for it. Such as a ticket to an event, an early pass to a game, or even renting it.\n3. **Reduce the speed of money of the main collection.**\n   It will help if you reduce the market supply in an organic way that makes sense. To do this, you will need to build and Integrate features on the top of the main NFT Collection, meaning be composable. Remember DeFi Legos? Why not build NFT legos as well? Let's integrate composable NFT protocols that generate more utility for your collection.\n4. **Generate revenue streams for NFT holders.**\n   Along with the utility and good feature integration, you can aim to generate revenue for the NFTs holders. For instance, sharing royalties could be possible; even with delegation (renting), the NFT holder could generate a revenue stream.\n\n\n---\n\nAt WakeUp we are pursuing to help startups, NFT Collections and users to be successful by building components to superpower their NFTs and achieve sustainability.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JSP_dWXSAryAhtyJjB8iC.jpg?height=1451&width=5001)\n\nWant to know more?\nFollow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wakeuplabs) and [Linkedin](https://bit.ly/3NDO4Qs) so you don’t miss anything!", "timestamp": 1657152092, "digest": "lCVHYmaKVIF7M4EfDs0OOp_WMq3BgglhEgYDZyeGhmw", "contributor": "0x9dFa9dfD15d2b2fa9717b4fc545c2bB35a29215c"}

For instance, this year more and more Lego bricks will be added on top of the NFT base blocks that were set up last year.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sdkCWsEvYj8FIgZ1ZKk_o.jpg?height=2627&width=5001)\n\nWe are sure that NFTs are not just pfp (profile pictures) or beautiful jpegs. NFT**s** are as simple and as complex to define who is the owner of a specific asset in the entire universe, both physical and digital (aka “metaverse”). Whether it’s a digital artwork, a metaverse land, a video game or a physical world asset; in a decentralized, intermediary-less, trustless, and open way.\n\n\n---\n\nIn WakeUp we are building products and solutions that add more utility to the NFTs, also that enhance the NFT experience for users and lower the complexity for devs of NFT dapps, protocols, services, games, collections, among others. And we are doing it by working side by side with them all, staying focused on their real needs.\n\nNFT adoption growth will be immense in the upcoming years, and the infrastructure is still not ready to bring next level of NFTs & platforms to life. We aim to support that growth, but we also want to be part of this innovation.\n\n\n---\n\nSoon more updates about WakeUp, stay tuned!\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n*Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wakeuplabs) and [Linkedin.](https://bit.ly/WakeUp_Linkedin)*", "timestamp": 1657152171, "digest": "5zOPnDQBgKv-btMlf-x6EU-aGLnbNtMSHB8gHkwotLs", "contributor": "0x9dFa9dfD15d2b2fa9717b4fc545c2bB35a29215c"}

Here we will look at the current situation and future potential of the NFT Market.*\n\nBy [0xGonzacolo](https://twitter.com/0xGonzacolo).\n\n![Look frens, there’s a Manny ❤](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g9ZSurQqXgtSrRt2uIrg5.png?height=1816&width=1400)\n\nIn 2021 we were able to witness unimaginable prices in the NFT market. Drawings of monkeys, digital lands for sale and even “wearables” to equip in virtual worlds, are some of the many NFT assets that emerged to invest or waste money.\n\nHowever this isn’t the most significant side about NFTs, the most relevant is that prior to its existence, there was no way to represent the tradable and interoperable digital asset “Ownership” without relying on a third party.\n\nWith this in mind, we are capable of understanding where we are standing and how the NFT market could change in the future, bringing us better investment ideas as well as setting our north to build better products.\n\nThe current situation is analogous to what happened with the “DEFI”(decentralized finances) some time ago. Before the daily use of Lending, Farming, AMMs and Flash Loans platforms, there was a chaotic moment that brought creation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zar78uRlNHH2TVDP1JZdL.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nEndless ERC-20, algorithmic stablecoins and governance tokens were needed, so the ecosystem could nourish and evolve over time.\n\nFrom the very first NFT hype at the end of 2017 with CryptoKitties, until now, the foundations have been set but neither great games nor the most relevant artist or the latest tech improvements, compares to what could be achieved in the future.\n\nWith a well-established groundwork ideas come up and devs are ready to start the game. By proving ownership of digital assets through quality software and hardware, we will be able to easily implement NFTs in the near future.\n\n\n---\n\n***What can be built on NFTs?***\n\nLet’s imagine an NFT key for your front door, it may not be worthy…\n\nRegardless of this, we can anticipate that in the future this kind of NFT may have an advanced code (or perhaps a better interconnectivity with other platforms), making the owner to be the only one capable of seeing the exact location of the door that can be opened with the key. The lock will not have space for a non-digital key, it will be triggered by a pop-up in your cell phone that will ensure the ownership of the NFT connected to it.\n\nHere’s a demo:\n\n[https://twitter.com/hm0429/status/1465241679800111107?s=20&t=ALSoe0Th5Rjv5ROIUWNDqQ](https://twitter.com/hm0429/status/1465241679800111107?s=20&t=ALSoe0Th5Rjv5ROIUWNDqQ)\n\nHow many times have you been locked out of your home? How many other times did you wait for someone to give you a key to unlock a rented place while on vacation? This is not a minor application.\n\nChecking the ownership of digital assets along with real-world implementations, is going to be a daily matter: football clubs memberships, plane tickets, or concert passes, will soon be exchangeable and digital.\n\n\n---\n\nUnlike previous scenarios where NFTs are there for particular situations, when we build on NFTs we are developing new products taking advantage of existing ones. Building in crypto is like playing with LEGOs, we keep adding bricks on top of existing structures.\n\nThere are already valuable NFTs out there although their use cases are limited. For instance, it was not until early 2022 that Twitter allowed ownership of NTFs to be verified and let users use them as profile pictures. Prior to that, ownership of the famous PFPs didn’t seem to serve much more than to show off.\n\n\n---\n\nNowadays, there are many protocols and projects building on NFTs.\nLet’s take a look at some of them:\n\n**[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)**\nThis is the NFT marketplace with the highest transaction volume in the world and they have created a nice user-friendly interface, APIs and has strong supporting information. It seems to achieve a good adoption combo in terms of audience.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZrubTWGTtlcwfJk_h5F_f.jpg?height=680&width=1280)\n\n**[Worldwide Webb:](https://www.webb.game/)**\n\nA browser game where NFTs work as add-ons for our characters in game.

{"id": "p9pw1MRHOoLidUrGvijYEia7Rtk_7cCdurGE0P_1evU", "title": "男房东与女房客", "body": "自从搬到了现在这个大房子以后，我原先的小别墅就租给了来自马来西亚的一对母子，资料上说母亲大概是37岁，名字叫杰丝，是一家软件公司的主管，看护照照片上还算个美女；儿子17岁，正好在房子附近的大学读预科。这可能就是学区房的好处，容易租出去。付清押金和第一个月的租金后，她们母子就入住了，一开始时候有些小问题，我还去修过几次，比如灯泡坏了，烟雾报警器需要更换啊，有两次我去的时候，会在门口听见噼噼啪啪的声音，然后我按门铃后很久杰丝才出来开门，她就一个人在家，脸色潮红，当时我没在意，然后路过书房时候，随便瞄一眼，发现书房的凳子上有一把那种塑料的刷沙发的大刷子，我也没在意。修好东西后，我就跟杰丝随便聊聊，她是马来西亚华人，可惜中文实在不咋地，于是我们基本英语聊，她在公司做测试主管，据说那家公司挺乱，手下人根本不听她的，随便什么软件，测试总是通过的，然后经常在客户那里出现bug，然后她就被大领导叫到办公室去训一通，我当时一笑说，\"Oh, you will be harshly spanked（你要被狠狠打屁股了）。\" 我随便说说，她当时脸就变得通红了。问她老公是不是在国内奋斗呢，她哼了一声，说自己早离婚了，她老公对家里从来不负责，把儿子都丢给她了。\n\n时隔大半年，我突然有一次收到council，就是澳洲的地方政府委员会的来信，说按照法律第几条，我门口的草长超过了20cm，必须在几号前剪掉，不然就要罚款2000刀，我大吃一惊，因为之前我散步路过那里，看到草长得太长，我跟租房中介说过，要中介跟杰丝说除草的事情，怎么还没除呢。而且时间非常紧迫，我就打电话给中介，中介说一时联系不上租客，我说这样吧，我自己周末去看看，如果还没除草，我就自己除，但是我要收费的，因为租房合约上写的除草是租客的责任。于是我周末跑过去了，果然，前花园满地的草，茂盛无比，我感到很气愤，前面中介都通知过你了。于是我敲门，杰丝出来了，我跟她说明情况，她很抱歉地说，“对不起，我前面太忙了， 刚刚换了个工作。” 我说好的，那我来替你除草，你应该收到中介的信的。我于是搬出准备好的除草机，大概干了一个小时，除完草，全部装进我带来的塑料袋里。我跟杰丝说，“好了，中介跟你说过收费的事情吧。”她说还没看邮件呢。我有些生气，随便说了声，“你真该被狠狠打屁股啊”。她的脸又红了。跟我说进屋谈吧。进屋之后，她表示太抱歉了，害得我差点被罚款，作为租客，实在不应该。她上一家公司管理太混乱了，bug不断出现在客户那里，她根本控制不了，这是系统性的问题，整个公司人都在混日子，她觉得实在难做，决定跳槽了，刚换了新工作，新的东西要学，还要带孩子，感觉很辛苦，说着说着她哭了，她父亲又刚刚去世，现在又换工作，所以她经常忘记事情。说小时候父亲对她特别严格，导致她一直压力很大，她小时候犯了错误，父亲就要用皮带狠狠抽她屁股，现在父亲去世了，想要他老人家打屁股都不行了。她哭得很伤心。我一下子愣住了，不知道说什么好，就说，\"要不我帮帮你？\" 她抬头看看我，居然点了点头，说，“好吧，这次除草的事情，我能不能就这样赎罪？” 这句话引起了我的感觉，我观察一下她，穿着休闲裤有些紧绷，短袖t恤，虽然年纪37了，但是身材相当不错，臀部浑圆，胸部饱满，这样的成熟的女白领人被打屁股，还是蛮刺激的。 看我在犹豫，她叹了口气，悠悠说到，“看来我年纪太大了，您不要勉强了。” 我也算是sp圈内人士，结婚生子后一直就不碰了，这次把我内心潜伏了多年的欲望挑起来了，我把心一横，把脸坂起来，认真地说，“我知道你年龄，年纪再大，你犯了错误，还是要被狠狠地打屁股！” 她眼睛一亮，随着把头低下去了。我这时候突然想起上次进门前的啪啪声音，以及我进门路过书房后看到的塑料刷子，我顿时一切都明白了，她那时候在DIY呢，看来她也是这方面的圈内人，也难怪，一个离婚女子，工作压力那么大，还要抚养孩子，她又是一个高级白领，当然不愿意出去乱找人，就需要这个来减轻自己的压力。我问她是不是去书房，她点点头，看来我猜对了。我们一前一后，我在前，到了书房，里面就一张桌子，桌上有台笔记本电脑，然后有一张不带扶手的凳子，我周围看了下，担心有什么摄像头，应该没有，于是我把凳子搬到书房中间，坐在上面，严肃地说，“你自己去把工具拿过来！”她打开书桌的一个抽屉，拿出一个刷子，正面就是刷子，反面是油光锃亮的塑料[板子](https://amzn.to/339moNz)，非常适合打屁股，她双手把刑具递给我，我拿在手里掂掂分量，还是蛮重的，上次我来的时候，估计她就是用这个DIY的。我左手握住板子，拍打了下右手，发出“啪啪”的声音，然后严肃地指了指我的大腿，“趴到我腿上来。“ 她的脸因为羞涩而涨得通红，咬着嘴唇，趴到了我的腿上，双手撑地。我一手按住她的腰，一手持板子，问道，”你觉得打几板子可以赎罪？“ 她不啃声，我怒道，”一个成年女子，犯了错误，我对你的惩罚必须比小女孩更加严厉，今天打你100板子绝不过分！“她默默地应承了。说罢，我一[板子](https://amzn.to/2xuC0Q3)就向她崛起的右臀抽过去了，她身子一震，接着左臀，没有一点保留，我使了全部力道，每一板子都绝不放水，这样一连打了约20板子，她臀部开始左右扭动着躲避，这让我更加兴奋，索性把她的裤子拉了下来，她穿的松紧裤，很容易就拉下来了，她不由自主地用手来挡，我就把她的手按在她的腰上，然后一不做二不休，把她内裤也拉到膝盖那里，停顿片刻，体验一下她无助的挣扎，然后用板子使劲地抽打在光屁股上，左右开攻，”啪啪“声回荡在书房里，伴随着她的呻吟声，她的臀部的扭动挣扎，我感觉自己那里硬了起来，于是定住心神，继续抽打，sp的处罚要避免情色因素，这是非常严肃的，严厉的处罚，尤其对这样的女白领，她们需要的就是严厉的处罚，从而得到心灵的解脱。打了约60板子，我停了停，开始训话，”你觉得该不该打，今天我一定会更加让你屁股开花，得到实实在在的教训！“\n\n说完我继续左右开弓，板子抽打在 她的臀峰上，臀肉像波浪一样凹进凸出，然后我打在臀腿交界处，她疼得并进了臀部肌肉，我观察到她的私处水淋淋的，她把双腿夹得紧紧的，承受每一次重罚。我用右腿把她的两条腿一起夹住，这样她的圆润饱满的屁股就 呈现在我眼前，我用巴掌用力打了10几下，她似乎放松下来，然后我突然用起了板子继续抽打，板子抽在她的光屁股上，她的屁股由开始的白皙，变成现在的红中带紫。100板子对她来说是那么漫长，由于疼痛难受，她甚至不顾一开始的淑女形象了，拼命挣扎，连头发都凌乱了，甚至开口求饶，\"I am sorry, please be merciful!（对不起，请打得轻点） \" 我丝毫不给她任何放水的妄想，想到这个已经为人人母的女子，像一个小女孩一样，光着屁股在我的板子下呻吟，感觉简直好极了，如果她儿子看到自己的母亲被一个陌生人这样狠狠地打屁股，不知道作何感想。于是我板子打得更加严厉。不知不觉，100板子打完了。我用手给她的臀部按摩了一会，感觉到滚烫一片，看来这次打得够狠。我感觉我按摩的时候 ，她的私处流出的水更多了，我心神有所荡漾，但是忍住了。过了一会，我问她需要冷敷吗？她说算了，想让疼痛的感觉延续长一些，记住教训。在我离开的时候，她的眼睛水汪汪地看着我，似乎意犹未尽，有什么话要跟我说，我也是成年人了，明白她想什么，但是道德还是约束了我，我跟她说，”下次有什么事情再找我吧。“ 然后头也不回地走了。\n\n又过了大约三个月，中介打电话给我说上次inspection租客那边很乱，建议了她好好整理下，我听了后，对中介的工作表示认可，然后说我打算去跟杰丝谈谈。约好了一个周六上午，我又见到了杰丝，跟她说起Inspection的事情，她说前一阵子正好回了趟马来西亚，所以房间里都没整理，我正打算原谅了她，她突然话锋一转，说：“即便如此，我觉得也是不能原谅的，处罚还是必须的，我以后不会让这样事情发生，临走之前一定要整理干净。” 我点头表示赞许她这种态度。她看着我，说：“要不又要麻烦您，对我进行处罚了。” 我说：“我很乐意。” 心里很美，她今天穿了件连衣短裙，把她的细腰丰臀存托得非常迷人。她走在前，我走在后，心里想，“这丰臀今天我一定把她打开花，让她得到实实在在的教训。” 来到书房，这里几乎成了刑讯室了，我照例坐在凳子上，这次我直接把她拉到我的腿上，把她的短裙一下拉起来，内裤直接褪下来，裸出光屁股，她大吃一惊，尽管知道打光屁股是不可避免，但是没想到一上来就这样，于是她本能用手去阻拦，我就索性把她的手按在她的蜂腰上，当时我有些惊讶，因为我发现她的臀部似乎近期挨过打，有些红红的巴掌印，但是我没有去深究（我将在“杰丝儿子的日记”中来说明这个事情）。\n\n接着，我抡圆了巴掌，用力打在她的右边屁股上，当时臀肉上就 一片红了，她身躯微微一震，眉头紧锁，接下来我一巴掌打在她的左边臀瓣上，又是一片红，如此像抽打耳光一样，左右开弓，打了约30巴掌，她开始踢脚，来减缓屁股上的疼痛。我就像上次一样，用右腿把她的两条腿固定住，这样她整个丰满的臀部就暴露在我眼前，我更加凶猛地抽打她的两半屁股，并且故意对准她的屁股大腿交界地方猛抽，我看到她的私密处很多水流出来了，看来她是真的sp爱好者，猛烈的抽打，让她起了生理反应，她估计怕被我看见，两腿夹得紧紧的，但是我还是对准那个附近猛抽，我甚至能看到液体沿着她的大腿流了下来，我于是用手抚摸她的臀肉，把手指划过她的私处，她似乎并不拒绝，而且把臀部耸起配合着。我没有进一步的行动。让她站起身来，把裤子穿好。我也站起来，然后命令她去房间拿个枕头来，过了一会儿，她抱着枕头来了。我命令她把枕头竖着放桌子边沿上，然后小腹趴上面，她照做，这样，一个白领丽人趴在桌子边沿，屁股高高撅起，我先抚摸了一阵子，然后解下我的皮带，抡圆了胳膊，一记抽过她的整个屁股，一条红痕像烈火一样划过她的两半臀肉，她浑身抖了下，这条火龙不断撕咬她整个丰臀，她的屁股开始左右扭动去躲避，但是我抽打得更加大力。抽打大约40几下，我扔掉皮带，抚摸她的臀部，从腰到右侧屁股，然后是左侧屁股，抚摸到两个丰满的臀瓣，臀腿交界地方，大腿根，然后我的手指划过她的已经潮湿的沼泽地，她身体微微颤抖，我用手指在那里打圈，她开始轻声呻吟起来，“Take me please!” 她开始失去控制。我的下半身变得火热，感觉那里已经硬如铁了，这么一个丰满丽人在我面前发出这种我难以拒绝的请求，我怎可回避呢？我脱掉裤子，戴上[套](https://amzn.to/3cSDX9k)（是的，来之前我考虑过这个可能性），从背后插入了她的身体，因为那里早已潮湿，非常润滑，所以我很顺利就进入了，她的身体里是火热的，把我包裹得紧紧的，这种感觉真好，我两手扶住她的腰臀，用力地抽插，如同我刚才用巴掌和皮带用力抽打她的丰臀一样，我用的的另外一个棍棒在她的屁股里面“重打40大板”，我一边抽插，一边用巴掌用力击打她两瓣臀肉，我的手绕过她的腋下去抚摸她的坚挺的乳房，她的两个乳头已经非常坚硬，如此这般，她忍不住大声呻吟，我于是抽插得更加猛烈，打屁股也更加用力。最后一股热浪进入套中，我们结束了这次打屁股的处罚。临走前，我们交换了电话和email。她恋恋不舍地让我离开了。", "timestamp": 1657151706, "digest": "klm9B2zpkDjD5sbMj5YyqLhDRk3YqXylMWmpGye8a7s", "contributor": "0x42083FD0B13BbfaE34554719367dBe2A2fcE707f"}

The market had been on a bull run for most of 2021, and sustaining such price increases is no longer possible. As prices drop, crypto companies that have kept their operations going by selling assets, or keeping afloat with venture capital, will get hit harder than others. Crypto companies with a sound business model and cash reserves can ride out the storm and continue operations when prices rebound. However, those without liquid assets or adequate operating capital may not be so lucky. Crypto companies going out of business is nothing new, but recently we’ve seen an unprecedented wave of bankruptcies as more and more businesses fail at an accelerated pace. Cryptocurrency has grown exponentially since its inception, making it extremely difficult for any company to stay afloat if they don’t have access to enough capital from outside investors or venture capitalists. Therefore, many crypto companies that can’t afford to keep operating once the bear market hits will eventually file for bankruptcy protection just like other industries do when they cannot pay back loans from outside investors anymore.\n\n## What is bankruptcy?\n\nBankruptcy is a legal process where a business creditor can get partial or complete ownership of the assets of the business in return for canceling all of the business’s outstanding debts. Each state has its own bankruptcy laws, and even if two parties file for bankruptcy at the same place and time, their bankruptcy proceedings can be very different. Bankruptcy is a process for relieving monetary distress. It does not give a company protection from creditors.\n\n## The current state of Crypto Companies and the bankruptcy wave\n\nThe cryptocurrency market fluctuates drastically, with some massive price swings. As the market went from bear to bull and back again, many investors lost all of their money. Now as the bear market continues, even more crypto companies are finding it difficult to survive. The cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile, which makes it very difficult for companies to operate and maintain their operations if prices drop significantly. As prices drop, many crypto companies that have kept their operations going by selling assets, or keeping the business afloat with venture capital will get hit harder than others. As the bear market continues and prices continue to drop, more and more crypto companies will file for bankruptcy protection.\n\n## Why are Crypto Companies Filing for Bankruptcy?\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile, making it extremely difficult for any business to survive if they don’t have access to enough capital from outside investors or venture capitalists. Entrepreneurs that want to start a crypto business usually need to raise money from investors that want to buy tokens at a later date for a higher price. However, the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile, making it extremely difficult for any business to survive if they don’t have access to enough capital from outside investors or venture capitalists. This has led to an increase in the number of crypto companies filing for bankruptcy protection.\n\n## The 5 stages of a Crypto Company’s bankruptcy process\n\nThe process of filing for bankruptcy protection begins with founders noticing the company is in trouble. Next, they attempt to find investors to help keep the company afloat. They try to sell assets, borrow money, or find other ways to generate cash. If those methods fail and the company is close to bankruptcy, they file a bankruptcy petition with the relevant court. Finally, the court approves the petition and appoints a trustee to oversee the liquidation of the company’s assets and the repayment of all of its creditors.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe wave of bankruptcy filings in the cryptocurrency industry is a normal part of the industry’s growth, and this process is natural for any growing industry. However, the increase in bankruptcy filings has been dramatic, and cryptocurrency investors should take note of this trend. While crypto companies filing for bankruptcy is a normal part of any growing industry, the increase in bankruptcy filings has been dramatic, and investors should take note of this trend. The cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile, making it extremely difficult for any business to survive if they don’t have access to enough capital from outside investors or venture capitalists. Entrepreneurs who want to start a crypto business usually need to raise money from investors who want to buy tokens later for a higher price.

At a glance this seems bleak, but I’m grateful to have lived this far. What I have lived already, I’ve got much to be grateful for.\n\nI’m grateful for my wife for showing unending patience and thoughtfulness, each day making me consider how lucky I am to have her.\n\nMy father, for teaching me to slow down and not get excited, rushing to nothing recklessly, and doing his damnedest to be a good father even though he had no example of such leadership to base it off of.\n\nMy mother, for teaching my to want for little and shun any hoarding instinct, all the while being the most caring individual I’ve ever met, except for perhaps her own mother.\n\nBoth of my grandmothers, for raising me better than I deserve.\n\nMy brother, for teaching me patience and convincing me to get a dog.\n\nMy dog, Ender, who is never short on reasons to make me laugh and smile. Because of him I finally understand unconditional love.\n\nFrom my wife’s cat I’m thankful to learn that it’s ok to not be loved by everyone. The world will move on.\n\nTyler, who has known me since we were 6, and his unending loyalty through all my worst years and most frustrating periods of life. Everyone needs a ride or die friend, and I was lucky to find mine early in life.\n\nMy other friend Tyler introduced me to Marcus Aurelius and the other stoics. He’s always down to talk philosophy, game anything out, and be the devil’s advocate.\n\nBrandon doesn’t give a damn about how other people perceive him, and always takes the honorable path. Both of these are among the most admirable qualities.\n\nAndrew took me in under his wing and taught me to not think like the poor (of bank and of heart) and to invest when all I wanted to do was spend.\n\nDylan gave me a chance to change my life forever.\n\nNoah has shown me that age means little when you have tenacity. An education and a will can move mountains.\n\nI’m grateful for Punia, who I admire for his ability to think outside the box and challenge standards.\n\nTom, for being the best leader in the workplace I could have asked for at a time when I was most fragile. \n\nI have so much more to be grateful for, and this list doesn’t begin to cover it all. My life has been full, and I must not forget that when times are tough. Even if 18264 is actually only 5, I’ve had plenty to cause me to be appreciative.

{"id": "rOwYnP0RLxyGu8-H6pvJGwr0arui4rWOkQAkQZVOvJw", "title": "GID今日话题：stepn（7月7日分析）与第三链建设", "body": "**一、stepn最近的动作**\n\n**（一）mable召开的非正式AMA**\n\n前天@Mable_Jiang 召开了一次非正式AMA，对于stepn家人来说，感受到了真正圈内从业者的魅力。并且，在爆发和扩张之时需要霸气，在稳定和缓和关系之时需要棉柔，项目、公司、国家皆如此（参见各国外交发言人、白宫新闻发言人的更迭）。这和性别无关，只和情绪有关。mable开始是stepn种子轮最早的投资方之一，5月份开始亲自下场参与运营，结果还没熟悉好情况，就被迫要力王狂澜。对于她个人来说，是宝贵的经历，对于stepn家人们来说，也算是承托希望的“更佳人选”。而且柔和兼知性，是目前stepn团队很需要的粘合剂。不过AMA的内容并没有什么超出预期的信息，这一点，从gst价格的波动就可以看出。\n\n**（二）ETH链的准备动作**\n\n昨天stepn在ETH链进行了一系列前期准备工作：\n\n**1.建立ETH链上的GMT**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZN0BCG5nf9_2PIpjeQS2V.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n**不同链上token的本质：**不同链上的同一代币，本质上是不同的代币。打个比方，美国某州因居住大量日本人，日本人习惯使用日元结算，但是该州日元储备又不够。于是该州X银行为了日本居民的日常消费方便，发行X日元。X银行保证X日元与日元保持1比1的兑换关系，但只限于州内使用。于是该州日本人持有并使用大量的X日元。那么问题来了，某天该州日本居民全家回日本探亲，所持有的X日元能在日本境内消费吗？显然不能，因为X日元是X银行发行的，只有在美国某州内才有价值，虽然X日元与日元的币值是1比1，但日本国内是不认可这种货币的。因此，我们Solana上的gmt和Bsc上的gmt实际上是两个token。只是官方通过交易所，实现了兑换。相当于X银行在日本国内设一个兑换点，X日元可以随时兑换为等价的日元。而上次的Bsc链GMT风波，实际上就是这个兑换点的X日元快换完了，于是兑换点先借用了一部分X日元，后面在X银行再回购（或储备）等额的日元，不过这一顿操作没有事先与州政府打招呼。这里面就有一个巨大的风险，就是X日元是无中生有的，X银行如果不回购（或储备）等额的日元，那么实际上X日元无法做到与日元1比1兑换，当大家都来挤兑时，X日元就崩溃了。这就是稳定币，OHM、UST都是如此（当然这里涉及合成稳定币与算法稳定币两种，就不展开讨论了）。\n\n那么现在ETH链的GMT就相当于，另一个地区银行发行的Y日元，需要再建立兑换点。目前FTX已经可以交易和兑换了，还在uniswap上可以兑换了（后者基于DOOARcex实现）这样ETH链上兑换GMT的cex与dex就都有了。\n\n**2.试运营GST的池子**\n\nGMT如果是stepn世界通用的货币，那么GST就是stepn世界各个国家内部的货币，既不流通也不等价（参考bsc链与sol链的gst价格）。所以进入ETH链，还需要建立在ETH生态的GST货币体系，项目方在此设立网点，gst可以在此进行兑换，换成u或者gmt。这就需要池子（Pool）。昨天项目方在uni上试运行了一下池子的功能，然后马上就撤了。从中我们可以看到，ETH链上的欢乐豆名称依旧是GST（以后麻烦了，有sgst、bgst、egst）。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gkk5JEX54KHAPizIFwGBL.png?height=792&width=1283)\n\n另外，注意一条，这种时候会有仿eth链的gst出现在dex上，比如谁都可以自己发一个叫token，名称不同，但是缩写依旧是gst，放到uniswap上。dex是去中心化的，只要有合约，有LP，都能完成交易。骗子会通过超控伪gst价格盘或者只进不出的貔貅盘来完成收割。\n\n如果这几天发现有人cx你，eth新链的gst可以提前认购，一定是骗子。\n\n**二、关于市场**\n\n大盘：长线依旧等待，现金为王。短线预期内的拉了一波了，这波快到头了。下跌趋势内，多军旗帜扛不了两天的，切忌“49年入国军”。\n\nstepn：鞋价和gst价格基本保持稳定。鞋价稳是因为市场没什么热度，这么低的价格很多玩家也懒得卖了。而gst价格比较有意思的是，长期看，挖卖提，必然越来越不值钱。但是随着币价下跌，很多玩家都懒得运动了，每日挖卖提的总量有所减少。散户抛压对市场的波动影响减弱了。如果gst价格继续横盘，每日波动依旧有10%左右，做做网格，也不错。\n\n**三、关于回本周期**\n\nsol链瞬时回本周期为100天，bsc链瞬时回本周期为50-70天。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nCiSw8pym94fNoN3P7pmJ.jpg?height=3184&width=2820)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kx8gluWxzzzMFXIvYFX-d.jpg?height=2960&width=3014)\n\n**四、关于mint收益** \n \n\nsol链暂停mint。bsc链mint略有期望收益。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WgT2aXY91oTnuTZMhl5yb.jpg?height=2382&width=1510)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s_9AaB7Vf64_Q5D_RRyuz.jpg?height=2400&width=1416)\n\n**五、关于合成收益**\n\n由于gst和鞋价企稳，目前合成净亏损并未减少。想博第三链门票的，可以再等等。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5nem4Y7w-f0x_77pCqYuk.jpg?height=484&width=1916)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z4ESlEtCfiKzPamVhfZpy.jpg?height=484&width=1904)\n\n", "timestamp": 1657158091, "digest": "ubg1PVHOrLIhevLASelP9H3o363s9tCeuzBZQjKcOI0", "contributor": "0x394FE2061482CC1bCcBc3b336f5ca4f48168dFE1"}

The Wilder Nation’s largest tribe, the Clan of Bones, was established a mere 1000 years ago, making it one of the youngest tribes on Oro. People of the Wilder Nation were seen as undevout in the eyes of Oro’s other inhabitants, and were not taken seriously until their invasion of and eventual triumph over one of Oro’s strongest nations, the people of Pantheon, a feat which earned them newfound respect across Oro. The three main tribes of the Wilder Nation are the central Clan of Bones, the northern Clan of Ore who are heavily involved with the Pantheon, and the southern Clan of Beast Blood who remain hidden amongst the “Forest of Whispers”. \n\nThe oracle abilities of the Wilder Nation far surpass those of any other tribe on Oro, so much so it is seen as being instinctual or essentially innate to their people. People of the Wilder Nation do not require any form of ritual or organ transferral to realise their divine abilities. Despite these uncanny abilities, their people are still labelled as undeveloped by many of Oro’s other tribes, a misconception that spurs from sheer ignorance and lack of understanding towards the Wilder Nation.

Discord社群创始人等带动的乱象：他们通过抢先注册一些非34D数字域名，然后借34D价格上涨之机，大肆宣传，忽悠其他人高价买入从而谋取不正当利益。此外，他们之前还曾意图出卖社区，并在期间打压其他34D建设者。\n\n经过慎重思考，我决定将背后的一些故事以及他们的一些不良行为讲出来，希望能让大家提高警惕，保持理性。\n\n声明：本人将对以下陈述负全部举证责任并保证真实性。\n\n**行径一：意图出卖社区**\n\n作为NFT研究员，在ENS的10K概念刚诞生的时候，我认为非常有趣，于是便对它进行了深入研究。同时，通过10K Club的Discord社群，我也结识了一些ENS深度爱好者和技术大佬。大家都看到了34D的潜力，买入并坚定持有了34D。同时，我们也想利用自身的特长，为34D赋能，增加34D的价值。\n\n但是，我所认识的这些持有者，技术和研究人员偏多，比如有加密货币交易所的研究员、知名NFT的核心开发人员、上市公司的前技术总监等。\n\n我们并不擅长社群运营，于是就希望与10K Club的DC群创始人合作，由他们运营社群，我们负责研究和开发，一起为34D赋能，给34D持有者提供更多福利。\n\n五月初我们做了规划：一是应用专利技术，建立10kmap.io，为34D持有者提供便利，并逐渐发展成一个统一元宇宙；二是做一个精选的NFT交易平台（10kuni.io，待发布），集成一些NFT研究成果，提高34D交易体验，并逐渐给34D赋能。\n\n但是，事与愿违。10K Club的DC群创始人们（如260.eth, aox.eth，oneill.eth）对10K Builder给34D赋能的计划并不感兴趣。而又由于那段时间有一篇中文文章《一名28岁的普通A9+讲述：为什么4digits ENS域名一定会成为域名领域的无聊猿》在海内外的广泛传播，而我是中国人，并积极推动给34D赋能，他们猜测我就是那个身家A9的中国富豪。于是，在我和他们讨论合作，想一起为34D赋能时，他们却想通过出卖社区赚取一大笔资金。\n\n以下是260.eth的回复，他们说他们不关心34D支持者们要做什么，如果我们需要社群，他们可以以1000ETH（当时折合价格为280万美元）的价格卖给我们！这可以买超过500个4D！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y1h1EsEWUZmSg4v7eB8XI.png?height=165&width=865)\n\n后来可能自己也认为自己穷疯了，不太好意思，降价到500ETH。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OrWVL_pO5b9eqIbeAc7pw.png?height=80&width=865)\n\n我很佩服他们的眼光，当时10K Club社群不足7000人，他们就看到了社群巨大的价值潜力（如果他们如今已经完成了社区出卖，请社区成员找他索要属于你的那一份，毕竟你也是其中的7000分之一）。同时，我也觉得十分荒诞离奇，原来他们始终都没有想着为34D做一些贡献，而是想着从中收割，谋取不正当的私利。\n\n三个创始人，260.eth,aox.eth，713.eth(现在叫oneill.eth)，我反复和他们进行了沟通。\n\n我认为10K这个概念不错，大家也都是持有者（后来发现，原来只有我们是持有者，而他们已经卖出了自己手中大部分的34D，非常讽刺），能够发挥自己所长，一起做好一件事就完美了。但没想到这些人格局这么差，提出了上述令人作呕的方案。\n\n后来其他10K Builder就建议我单独建立一个社区。而我当时仍然一直认为我们都应该为34D赋能，没必要再去建一个社区，从而导致社区分裂，一起将10K Club做好就很好了。为此我还想了折中方案，并给他们都一一发送了消息，近乎低三下四地去和他们沟通。\n\n260\\.eth直接不再回复。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LhLww1MsyCshus_DpO46P.png?height=345&width=865)\n\n以下是aox.eth回复（是的，我得到了fucked）,并拉黑了我。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SJCbICXlSVSWEJ9yDeQjN.png?height=813&width=633)\n\n713\\.eth还直接教我怎么割韭菜了，显然深谙其中道理，呵呵。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyGW0bFNYWHnoouQKfypM.png?height=746&width=607)\n\n这是我对他的回复\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SyzjolmaAyzqVOjzzpuhY.png?height=422&width=626)\n\n最终我和很多社区成员也非常无奈，只能选择逐渐再建立一个社区。但是，当时我认为34D在发展早期，没有必要把他们这些丑陋行径说出来，导致社区分裂（我现在才知道我的善良带来了多大的失误，使得他们继续从中谋取不正当利益，给社区成员造成了巨大的损失）。\n\n**行径二：打压其他34D建设者**\n\n在技术团队的没日没夜工作下，比特币披萨节当天，俱乐部网站10kmap.io正式上线。同时我们成立了10K Universe的DC社群。由社区成员志愿捐献，我们拿出了5个4D域名以及7.5ETH开展活动，鼓励大家熟悉ENS的操作。第一轮活动中，我们的宣传口号是“价值500ETH的4D域名赠送”的原因，其一是认为未来4D价格也许能像无聊猿一样，涨到100E的水平，另外也是嘲讽10K Club DC创始人想以500ETH价格将 DC社区成员出卖这件事。\n\n之后，我们也会去10K CLUB 的DC群发一些动态，让大家关注项目发展，鼓励大家参与活动，也能获得一些福利。但是，当他们发现10K Universe热度起来了，有34D持有者逐渐加入了10K Universe，这可能不利于他们将来割韭菜了，哈哈。\n\n然后他们可能就找了一个10K CLUB管理员，3070.eth，在10K Club社群内公开污蔑10K Universe花钱买机器人粉丝之类，并拿出了所谓的“证据”。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GvSLUPyu-FHwcIIU5teLn.png?height=154&width=865)\n\n我对他进行了反驳，以上是我给他的解释。那段时间社区成员仅增长了几百人，而且是因为有中国的KOL帮我们进行了宣传。因为10K Universe社区志愿者Hanz之前参与管理过的社群曾遭受过机器人攻击，他担心有机器人加入社群，甚至手动封禁了100多个账户（那时候整个社群人数才1000多人），反而因此误封了很多真实用户。\n\n所以我想让3070.eth拿出他的证据来源，看是不是存在机器人。于是，我私聊了他，而他至今都没有回复，但却直接在10K CLUB将我禁言了7天！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NOIjr9Ediwa3isTH1TQ6m.png?height=527&width=865)\n\n这些人的行为实在让我伤心透了。从此之后，我就再也没去10K Club的DC群说过一句话。\n\n**行径三：违背社区投票结果，抢先注册一些域名，并通过宣传，意图高价卖给社区成员**\n\n虽然他们的举动让我受了一些委屈，但本来想着也没必要说出这些事情，占用公共资源。而且，之前关注到他们的账户，他们基本也把自己手里的34D都卖光了，想必该消停点了。没想到最近34D的价格刚有点起色，他们又开始动歪心思了，悄悄注册了某些品类的域名。然后，以260.eth为首，在推特更换带有阿拉伯头巾的头像，修改自己的推特名字，并鼓励不知情的其他用户也进行修改，通过鼓吹阿拉伯语数字域名和炒作中文数字域名等，意图进一步地割韭菜。炒作阿拉伯语数字域名和中文数字域名，难道不是因为他们认为阿拉伯人和中国人人傻钱多？\n\n要知道，曾经10K Club社群还发起过投票，删除了所有非34D域名的其他频道！而他们和少数人居然为了自己的利益，违背社区的投票结果，公开宣传34D以外的域名，从而高价卖给被蒙骗的用户！\n\n删除其他频道的提案和目的\n\n[https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e](https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e)\n\n260\\.eth更换了戴有阿拉伯头巾的头像，并更改了推特名字\n\n我想知道他是否清楚阿拉伯头巾的正确佩戴方法及含义。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjN7CjsNnhG1OcGmSYR5-.png?height=636&width=865)\n\n在推特频繁宣传阿拉伯语数字域名。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RAvL6nsHZ0ZRy4Fwju-xu.png?height=1285&width=865)\n\n最近又转向对其他域名的宣传\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/exUZK-8QY9FvfO5brxg13.png?height=655&width=865)\n\n我想人们一旦购买了它，他们钱包中的资金将会减少。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xYKk08zTeN_vQM3tcSMPi.png?height=1201&width=865)\n\n于此同时，他却提前注册，并试图高价出售这些他非常看好的域名。既然如此坚定看好，为什么你却以如此低的价格出售？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZIAf8PHcAUojOJpjkhY1_.png?height=265&width=865)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kVbRaGQI6Ti3eHqhGXa1_.png?height=439&width=865)\n\n同时他仍在不断注册新的域名\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7kTKm1WLG6DAp5d5RuErv.png?height=495&width=865)\n\n请注意，这还只是他的公开账号。当你看到一只蟑螂在地板上乱窜时，很可能还有很多只蟑螂藏在冰箱后面或者水槽下面。\n\n他们这些行为让我感到不舒服。因此，我决定将这背后的故事讲出来，交给社区去评判。希望社区成员能够擦亮眼睛，保持理智，不要被少数人蒙骗，进而损失资金。也希望34D持有者不要因为个别人的行径，就对34D丧失信心，作为未来的Web3身份中的蓝筹，它的未来价值也不会受到个别社群成员不良行为的影响。而我们依然有着强大的10K Universe社区，将会为34D不断增加新的有趣又有价值的场景。\n\n我始终认为，君子爱财，取之有道，在此也正告260.eth等人，不要再做一些通过伤害社区利益而谋取个人私利的事情了！\n\n目前，仍有很多10K Builder在不断为34D宣传和增加价值，请保持信心和关注。同时也欢迎大家加入10K Universe社区，建设一个更加强大的10K未来。\n\n社群相关链接：<https://linktr.ee/10kuniverse>\n\n我们的建设者有（排名无先后顺序，以下名单并不完整，希望大家补充，也希望大家参与进来）\n\n5660\\.eth; 550.eth; 8249.eth;

必须全额支付美元现金余额的看法是，如果你的钱在美国的交易所，保持美元（非稳定币）是谨慎的，因为它可能享有更好的保护， 并且不要在他们身上保留比你愿意失去的更多的加密货币， 很多人将其视为 FDIC 的事情， 我不认为那是事实 ， 我认为，如果作为客户，您有现金余额，他们实际上可能已将其保留为现金，并且在这些诉讼中，他们有义务在其他索赔之前将其提供给 ， 但 tbh idk

{"id": "a_Fd_2Sl5RunKl-MEbvN-8gmscbC6cDvt8B_EXg2nAc", "title": "Celestia 六月的项目成果更新", "body": "***原文：***\n\n[https://blog.celestia.org/july-engineering-update/](https://blog.celestia.org/july-engineering-update/)\n\n***译者：Hoyt***\n\n最近几个月就像一场旋风，首先和首要的是 **[Mamaki 测试网](https://blog.celestia.org/celestia-testnet-introduces-alpha-data-availability-api/)**上线。Mamaki 上的数据可用节点已经能按预期工作，并且一些更新已经正式提上了日程，比如编码错误欺诈证明。\n\n我们正在开发的一些项目，已经在进行内部测试，比如基于 **[Optimint ](https://github.com/celestiaorg/optimint)**和**[量子引力桥](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge)**（Quantum Gravity Bridge）的主权独立的 rollup 示例。\n\n在本更新消息中，我们将展示过去几个月中，项目进展的亮点。\n\n### Mamaki 测试网\n\n从上个月 Mamaki 测试网布署以来，出现了许多成功项和挑战项。开发者能够成功连接到数据可用性 API，并且向测试网提交 PayForData 消息。同时，他们也能够获取指定命名空间的数据。这些使得可扩展的数据可用性层，应用于 rollup 有了基础。\n\n测试网还吸引了许多社区成员来搭建他们自己的节点，150个有效验证者的空位，很快就被填满了，更不用说参与网络实践的轻节点和全节点（译者注：存储节点）。我们感谢参与测试和提供反馈的每一个人。\n\n当然，测试网也不是风平浪静的。网络出现了一些不稳定的情况，主要是最新版 Tendermin t的新 p2p 模块造成的，我们的测试网升级到了这一版本。\n\n已知节点维护是放大不稳定情况的问题中的一个。已经确定的是，最大已知节点数，**[被硬编码为 1000](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/8683)**。节点可以在它们的配置文件中，调整已知节点设置，但是这无法阻止它们已知的节点数，超过它们设置的值，因为最终只有硬编码的那个值起效。简单说，节点被大量已知节点冲垮了。\n\n我们尝试了多种修复方法，比如切换回旧的 p2p 模块，不幸的是，它的问题更多。并且，旧模块和新模块存在一些兼容性事项，导致问题更严重了。毫无疑问，我们的核心和应用团队把上个月最好的时光，都花在调试和解决测试网的问题上了。\n\n好在有 Tendermint 团队帮助调试和修复影响稳定性的那些问题。显然，我们不是，在升级到最新版本后，遭遇到 p2p 问题的唯一 Cosmos 链。\n\n之后，我们打算采用更稳定的 Tendermint 版本，只要它仍然支持新引入的带优先权功能的交易池，我们不在意是升级还是降级。带优先权的交易池，对 rollup 来说是一个必备的功能，它能够保证成功向 Celestia 提交它们的区块，只要多付一些燃料费来取得优先权。\n\n### 量子引力桥\n\n三个月前，我们在西班牙集中开发期间，对量子引力桥进行了首次测试，它能在内部的开发网上成功运行。它的工作方式，近似于轻节点转发器。Celestia 的验证者集提供一个数据可用证明，他被桥的合约转发，同时转发的还有相应的数据承诺和验证者集的状态。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fuWOaRQwLb6hG3adOqJ_S.png?height=392&width=698)\n\n桥的目的，是给，我们称之为 **[Celestium ](https://blog.celestia.org/celestiums/)**的，某种混合式 rollup 提供，安全和可扩展的数据可用性。\n\n进行集成测试期间，我们发现转发器太频繁地，只发出用于跟新状态的必要数据的一部分。如果没有这些数据，Celestium 无法知道它们发布到 Celestia 的数据是否可用。\n\n为了解决这个问题，桥的设计被改变为更加同步化，这使（译者注：桥的）合约能够确保所有必要的数据都按顺序更新了。这些努力使得桥对 Celestium 来说更安全了，为几个月后在 Mamaki 测试网上的部署做出了贡献。\n\n### Optimint\n\nOptimint 被用于在 Celestia 上构建主权独立的 rollup，它使用 Cosmos SDK 并对 Tendermint 做了替换。不同于已有的 rollup，主权独立的 rollup 会在 p2p 网络中，分发自己的欺诈证明或者有效证明，以便节点进行本地验证。\n\n我们对使用 Optimint 的主权 rollup 进行了内部测试。通过测试，我们改善了可靠性，比如即使序号生成器崩溃了，也能**[成功提交区块](https://github.com/celestiaorg/optimint/pull/442)**。超时和错误处理逻辑也得到了改善。改善抗掩盖性对 Optimint 的序号生成器很重要，因为一开始它是中心化的——我们正在努力实现领袖选举和去中心化的序号生成器。\n\n### Celestia-node\n\n测试网发布以来，大部分的测试和改进，都聚焦于数据可用性节点的功能上 。包括针对多种网络构型的，**[初期的本地测试](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-node/pull/702)**。比如，存储全节点重建区块的能力，在（译者注：单个全节点）无法连接到足够使数据能重建的轻节点的构型中进行了测试，当然，它能连接到其它全节点，使得整体上，有足够的轻节点可以重建区块。\n\n下一个提高区块重建效率和可靠性的步骤是，改善在 p2p 网络中发现全节点的能力。比如，全节点可以在网络中广告它自己，以便轻节点可以收到广告并且连接到它们。改善可发现性，同时对提供更受欢迎的网络构型有利，因为轻节点将能连接到更多存储全节点，提高数据采样和重建的可靠性。\n\n发布 Mamaki 测试网的同时，错误编码欺诈证明也即将发布。这个欺诈证明可以警告轻节点，某个区块的纠删码被错误地生成了。这样一来，欺诈证明就被全部集成和完成了。下一步将是实现大规模的网络中的测试。\n\n社区成员参与测试网的好处在于能发现更多问题和 bug。总的说来，更好的用户反馈流程，能帮助我们更好地理解潜在的用户体验问题。接下来的工作将围绕节点的 RPC 接口展开，这将有利于用户和依赖我们的服务，比如基于 Optimint 的主权 rollup。\n\n### 总结\n\n综上所述，这是进展巨大的几个月。针对测试网，我们还有一些重要的、额外的计划——请保持关注。\n\n\n---\n\n> *声明：本文内容仅供参考、交流，不构成任何投资建议。若存在明显的理解或数据的错误，欢迎反馈。*\n>\n> *本文内容系 W3.Hitchhiker 原创，如需转载请标明出处。*\n>\n> *商务合作：hello@w3hitchhiker.com*\n>\n> *官网：<https://w3hitchhiker.com/>*\n>\n> *W3.Hitchhiker 官方推特：<https://twitter.com/HitchhikerW3>*", "timestamp": 1657160944, "digest": "p2IbYiyieO0N4dm9ya775O9e9fXMYRzkPj-T7zRuRTA", "contributor": "0xE43a21Ee76b591fe6E479da8a8a388FCfea6F77F"}

影像本体论\n\n不论是超级写实主义绘画、雕塑还是摄影，作品都一定带有主观性，只要存在人的介入，媒介本身的认识论会被虚拟化，而摄影是物理上对绘画的补充，然而它失去了色彩、透视、结构等层面的表现力，当选择使用摄影纪实，“纪实”是人的心理作用，事实是摄影后只是对人主观性的复制，通过构图、阴影、隐喻等构成人对可复制“纪实”的偏好。\n\n古代及宗教认为肉体不腐烂，生命将会得到延续，其关键在于和时间抗衡，以物理和化学上的处理变得“恒定“，现在的人体冷冻技术，同样不具备完善的科学根据，只是理论上冷冻人有机会复活，同样也是与时间抗衡而等待人类的技术发展，尽管人的器官和躯体能被完整保留，但神经元极其脆弱，解冻后的精神状态可能不再是生前的本人，我认为这是木乃伊情结的延申。\n\n> 一具用泡碱处理过的、干瘪的和呈深褐色的木乃伊，也就是古埃及的第一尊雕像。但是金字塔或通道中的迷宫不足以防止墓穴被盗，还要采取另外的保险措施，以防万一。所以在石棺附近，除了撒些小麦当作死者的食物外，还放上几尊陶制的小雕像，作为备用的木乃伊，死者躯体一旦毁坏，这些雕像便可充当替身。从雕塑艺术的这种宗教起源中，可以揭示它的原始功能：复制外形以保存生命。显然，在史前洞穴中发现乱箭穿身的泥雕熊表现了同种心愿更积极的一个方面：泥熊等同于活兽的神化物，为的是祈求狩猎成功。\n\n——《摄影影像的本体论》 \\[法\\]安德烈·巴赞 André Bazin\n\n木乃伊情结和人体冷冻技术属于对“人类本位”的追求，另一种将以媒介的方式帮助人们回忆，以至于不被人们遗忘，又或者说这种媒介方式创造了符合现实面貌而时间上独立存在的理想空间，例如现在的区块链技术有可能实现“永久性”且不被抹除地记录信息、著名的画师能够让人死后存在于形似的记忆和概念中；不再追求于本体的永生，转向满足于人对心理和精神满足的追求，从而克服人对时间流逝的需求。\n\n基于物理的技术能完好地保留了视觉上的客观性，人并不需要通过艺术手法主观地干预，摄影师只需要选择摄影对象，就能实现“纪实”，信息技术的存在能够使得摄影的结果能以数字的方式保存下来，而不再局限于画作存在腐朽的可能性，从媒介的角度上它实现了“存在的永生”，却不再是本体了，它满足的是场景、人被记录的那瞬间能够重现在面前，那种追忆和怀念。\n\n摄影和超写实主义绘画的区别在于数字化、物理上保留的客观性，后者保留了对美学的追求和幻想，当尽可能创造逼真程度，这种时候色彩则失去了表现力。\n\n前面提到的几何透视、阴影则在绘画和摄影的基础上制造幻象，最终导致摄影也如同绘画存在独特的美学，绘画也成为了摄影的对象。将绘画的美学意义（表现性）和心理意义（再现性）区分开。\n\n> 电影只是在造型艺术现实主义演进过程中最明显的表现，而现实主义的原理是随文艺复兴运动出现的，并且在巴罗克风格的绘画中得到了最极端的体现。\n\n几何透视之解决了形似，而无法体现物的运动，若是要追求幻象，则失去了造型上的艺术，要么使得复制品的瞬间表现有逼真，要么是象征、隐喻、造型超越了原型，前者为在虚拟中企图暗示“复制品”的真实和自然，后者为精神的表现力和对美的追求。\n\n> 在达到形似效果方面，绘画只能作为一种较低级的技巧，作为复现手段的一种代用品。唯有摄影机镜头下的客体影像能够满足我们潜意识提出的再现原物的需要，它比几可乱真的仿印更真切，因为它就是这件实物的原型。不过，它已经摆脱了时间流逝的影响。影像可能模糊不清，畸变褪色，失去纪录价值，但是它毕竟产生了被摄物的本体，影像就是这件被摄物。\n\n媒介缘由“复制品”绘画木乃伊情结主观重现，实现“永生”摄影写实主义基于物理上的客观性\n\n# \n\n## \n\n人具有的自反性指的是反思自己的言行、思想、道德等且加以修正，使用知识从而调整自己的行为，这是思想、知识影响行为的双向过程。\n\n若是行为被自反性改变，是行为的自我审视(reflexity monitoring of action)，道德方面最著名的例子是《论语·学而》“吾日三省吾身：为人谋而不忠乎？与朋友交而不信乎？传不习乎？”，根据约定习俗、社会规范以监视自我的行为规范是否一致，同时是约束自我行为的合理性根据。另一层次是检点行为的动机(motive,motivation)，尽管动机不一定能被社会接受，但它可以作为个人价值观的延申促成了做出行为的合理性。\n\n自反性除了反思道德，是以认识论的产物，对未意图后果(unintended consequences)和未认知的条件(unacknowledged conditions)的认识，从而分解出意图、目的、潜在意料之外，例如马克思解释的经济和生产条件、佛洛依德揭示潜意识动机。\n\n假如在一个资讯完全充分且有效的社会，有人打破防疫规定那么它在社会整体而言是不道德的行为。\n\n## \n\n吉登斯认为人类已经将社会进行了解释性研究但又反过来被这些理论所影响，从而形成社会秩序，它并不是由自然进化而成，而是人为预先计划。事实是人们总是解释一个社会包含全部个体的行为，因此他们将不断发展自己的理解来调整行为，从而形成了社会周期，最终社会科学知识改变人类的活动，社会学服从双重解释。\n\n技术本身是对自然现象的利用和捕获，而社会科学大多建立于可解释性、它不能够像技术发展一样存在进化，因为可解释的集合中包含了拥有自反性的个体，每个人都有机会改变其状态，却又受环境的约束（行为主义），世界并非一个独立的观念却独立且排他性的被认识，而社会知识观念和世界存在相互的交流和作用，即“思想和行为的不断折射”。\n\n既然如此，社会将充斥着自反性带来的不确定性，这是可解释性或可回归之外。\n\n> 哲学家们只是用不同的方式解释世界，而问题在于改变世界。\n\n——《关于费尔巴哈的提纲》马克思\n\n可解释性和唯物现实的对立，存在因势利导的可能性，利用了人存在自反性的特征，这在索罗斯的反身性和金融心理学有实际应用。\n\n社会学本身是一种用以监控的知识，早在奥古斯特·孔德的社会物理学以自然科学的研究方法对社会秩序进行预测和控制，在现代化社会往往自反性更强，存在习俗和传统的松动和瓦解，称之为“后传统社会”，人越来越需要自己做抉择，无法依赖家庭、公会、政府，不能墨守成规。\n\n社会学论述常识性知识现实世界或社会生活社会行动或公共政策\n\n(互为自反关系)\n\n例如在选举之前不断地进行民调并发布民调，促使更多人选择从众，积极的预期产生正反馈，但它也取决于民众如何看待，反身性在资讯有效的情况下复杂得无法准确计量，导致民调总是难以预测选举结果。\n\n它打破了传统主客观的二元对立，一般客观来讲主体认识的过程不考虑客体的反向影响，因此获取的“知识”即认识论，而事实上是理论和真实相互对应，如果要了解一个对象，不以主体投射或情感影响，它要求自我约束保持理性和科学严谨作为主流学术的要求之一，最起码它们现在是科学的专业伦理。\n\n尽管在自然科学中，主客观二元对立也不是绝对的，海森伯发现测不准原理，粒子的动量和位置不可同时被确定，对例子进行测量必定会扰动该例子；双缝实验中光线在穿过两个竖条空隙之后，光屏上形成的是多条平行的竖纹，揭示了粒子的波粒二象性，即微观粒子具有波动性。\n\n在心理学中，实验的客观性围绕着招募志愿者进行控制变量的小范围实验，实验者可通过单面镜观测他们，而志愿者们却不知他们正在被窥见，因此得出这样的实验操作是“客观”的；另一种是自然实验，2021 年的诺贝尔经济学奖是基于一个自然实验，其中 David Card 围绕劳动经济学关于最低工资,一般来说移民通常定居于容易找到工作且高薪的地方，认为如果存在大量人口涌入，供给则增加，本地工人的可替代性更强，在马列尔事件发生大规模移民后，使得目的地 Miami 的工作人口在几个月内增长了 7%，对比 1980 年 Miami 和其他相似城市（对照组）同期的发展，尽管经历 80 年代经济衰退，但工资和失业率相比下大致相同，并没有说明马利托人的消极影响；这种最为接近严谨的随机对照试验但这样的环境并非学术实验刻意造成，自然实验将比自为制造的社会实验更有说服力，它允许了主体和客体之间在一段时间存在相互作用从而用时间检验移民政策的效用。\n\n## \n\n常规文学、电影等媒介往往刻意制造沉浸式的观感，告诉受众这是现实，使得受众将自我代入其中，例如电影中刻意隐藏摄像机以满足受众的窥见感；自反性则打破“这是真的”命题，反思现实主义，在人为制造和真实（逼真）制造矛盾和冲突，告诉自己这并不是真的，但我又要去面对这一题材，寻求其他的解决方案，常见于推理、悬疑，在虚的层面上去反思世界观和背景，这听起来像是对观众的玩弄，而观众对故事的合理性的反思将进一步推动情节，尽管不存在游戏上的交互，这种本我与故事的“我”的交流是利用了媒介本身的自反性，绘画可以是基于摄像的物理层面的创作，即痕迹上的创造，从本体论的角度来看，它刻意打造了存在的幻觉，可基于电影，通过精神上的感知构造了存在不同表现力的媒介，例如动画、戏剧，甚至是交互式电影，精神需求是实在的，但代入的同时它极力隐蔽了作品本身的主体性，以至于出现“被带着走”或“被误导”的情况，而这种设计正暗示着该故事的虚假性从而制造矛盾。\n\n## \n\n在现代化社会中，传媒经济形成了符号经济学和空间经济学的研究和应用，前者可通过格雷马斯语义方阵等符号结构工具对传媒产品进行解剖，从而揭示特征基于经验主义制造“复制品”，从而形成消费文化和审美趋势，传媒符号化产品使得其组成内容不再重要，因为作为产品本身在互联网可以被快速获取，它更依赖于营销和销售方式的差异性。符号产品提供的是人主观对它的意义，而非实用，例如奢侈品和体验服务，符号价值可在空间上的文化结构被识别，称之为“符号近邻化”(Semiotic Neighborhoods).\n\n从媒介即认识论到皮尔斯的符号学理论，符号的三元结构必须同时拥有涉义(thought)、符号(symbol)、实物(object)，它否定了在生产过程中信息的内在意义，人能认知到符号是因人和符号之间的互动和交流，人赋予的意义并非一成不变，用认知神经科学的研究结果来讲，右脑参与了隐喻的理解，对应脑区的激活程度取决于隐喻的熟练度和理解程度，萨尔特曼隐喻诱引技术的依据是：大部分社会交流是非言语的，思想以图像形式出现，隐喻是认知的中心，观念的含义、理性、情感和经历体验共存。\n\n> 某个水果店经理在洋葱、胡萝卜陈列橱窗上贴了一幅标语：“全世界无产者，联合起来！”他这样做目的何在？究竟向人们传送什么信息？他是否对全世界无产者的大联合真的十分热衷？他当真觉得他的热情促使他非得让公众都来了解他的理想不可？他是否真的想过，这个大联合该怎么实现，实现了又怎么样？我敢断言，大多数商店经理们对于橱窗上标语的意义从来是不会过问的。他们也不会用那样的标语来表达自己真实的意见。标语是上面批发洋葱和胡萝卜的同时发下来的。水果店经理拿过来往橱窗上一贴就完事了，因为这是习以为常，司空习惯的事情。但要是不贴，就会有麻烦。上面会指责他不按规定布置橱窗，有人甚至会控告他反党反社会主义。为了过得下去，他非照章办事不可。这样的小事千千万万，做了才能有过上“与社会谐调一致”的生活保障。 水果商对于标语的内涵是不闻不问、无动于衷的。他不会有什么个人愿望来让公众了解标语表达的理想。这当然不是说水果商的举动毫无意义的，或者说标语什么都没告诉大家。标语确实是一个符号，包含了一个说不出口来但却十分明确的信息。口头上说起来，可以这样表达：“我，水果商某某，是懂得我该作什么，是守本分的。我是个靠得住的人，无可挑剔。我很听话，所以该过上平安日子。”这个符号当然有一个接受者，那就是水果商的上级领导；符号同时也是一个挡箭牌，用来防范那些揭发举报者。标语的真实意义因此深扎在水果商的生存之中，反映了他的根本利益。那么，什么是他的根本利益呢？\n\n——《无权者的权力——纪念扬·巴托契卡》哈维尔\n\n哈维尔将其归咎为这样的符号可以帮助他惟命是从的可鄙境界，同样掩盖了权势的可鄙基础，那就是后极权社会的维系产物——意识形态。该意识形态正是利用了符号自反性的欺诈性，水果商可能真不愿意参与其中却因此合理化自己的处境，但该符号的意义并非是内在的，它的传播让更多人陷入这个集体主义的陷阱，从而做些违背社会道德的事物而被合理化，除此之外它也可以掩盖人对政权和对失业等陷入不利情况的恐惧，企图让人被迫的相信制度本身是自然而成的；换而言之，符号的隐喻是人民能够通过加入这场运动从而改变社会进程，也可为自我开脱，现代人明确意识到政治形式具有人为构成的性质，从旧现实的意识和旧形式中抽离，嵌入政治进程。\n\n# \n\n自反性现代化指的是工业社会时代的自我毁灭，而击溃它的不是西方现代化的危机而是胜利成果，如果说现代化是工业社会形态抽离并重新嵌合，那么自反性现代化指的是另一种社会形态为基础重新进行现代化进程；现代社会的内在活力削弱了阶级、阶层、职业、性别角色、核心家庭等在社会中的形成，也削弱了自然技术经济进步的连续性和条件。在这种情况下，进步可能会转化为自我毁灭，一种现代化化削弱并改变另一种现代化。资助的现代化过程可以是无意且非政治的，绕过了所有政治决策、路线冲突、党派之争。\n\n传统观念总是认为社会剧变往往意味着解体和痛苦，事实上贫富差距、财富累积等的坐标轴发生了变化，经济增长、技术进化和就业保障可以使得工业社会进入新的时代。\n\n> 想得到的 + 熟悉的 = 新的现代化\n\n——《再造政治：自反性现代化理论初探》乌尔里希・贝克\n\n## \n\n工业社会被淘汰的另一面是风险社会,社会、政治、个人会极力避开工业社会的监督和保护制度.第一阶段为人民意识到这种制度引发的系统性风险和威胁,但这些问题往往是局部的而且未成为秩序冲突的核心,社会中越来越多的风险残余即由人决策产生的风险将被合理化的存在。 它带来的是全社会的不安全感。\n\n第二个阶段则出现了工业社会的危险支配整个社会，制度的失控成为了社会和政治矛盾，旧社会不得不根据工业社会的模式进行决策，利益组织、司法系统都会受到人为决策引发的风险溢出导致的争论和冲突。\n\n风险社会的产生是因人民对工业社会的自信，对寻求进步主义或寻求生态影响等危险的抽象化主导者社会人民和制度的思想和行动。\n\n**自反性(reflexive)指的是反思(relfection),而自反性现代化指的是自我对抗(self-confrontation)。现代化基础和后果的区别在于现代化自我反思层面上的知识和科学化的增加。**\n\n高风险和高机遇的集体将导致现代化后果的自我冲突，本质上在于社会的组成部分的责任分配冲突，具体来讲，工业社会无法控制现代化背后的风险，例如核技术、化工技术、基因研究、环境生态的迫害、过度军事化、贫富差距等。\n\n人民一旦意识到这些风险潜在的危机有可能超越了社会对安全和稳定的范畴，这些议题极有可能产生动摇社会秩序的前提假设，同时司法系统和政治决策也会成为一个特别议题。\n\n一般来说，GDP 的 expediture approach 计算并不包括家务、做饭等家庭事物，尽管这些是支持家庭成员劳动成为可能性的要素，但这些发生在家庭内，对整个社会来说是非排他性的。根本原因是自然资源是现代工业的基础但在现代化确立之后便逐渐消失，风险的存在在于制度基础的边缘化，然后阶级意识和进步的信念枯竭，导致个体(the individual)不得不成为个人(an individual)，**个人生活中的机遇和矛盾原本可以在家族、宗族、社会阻止等中得到解决，而现在越来越多由个人来感知和处理，非核心家庭名存实亡，核心家庭的数量减少。不平等的增加但阶级不平等和阶级意识已失去社会中的核心地位，自我不再是明确的自我，而是分裂为自我的矛盾话语。**\n\n在“后现代”社会中，个人必须掌握“风险机遇”，个人不能在“可靠”基础上做出抉择，必须考虑到行为可能的后果。（例如有交易经验的人能认识到“计划交易”的重要性）\n\n生态危机的本质是工业社会的一个制度性危机，技术工业的发展引起潜在威胁的不可预测性和失控的可能性，否则系统性的毁灭，人民将意识到需要一种新的自反性且自主自决的必要性，在风险社会中，社会具有狭义上的自反性，社会会成为自身的问题。\n\n这种充斥着不确定性和风险危机的现象被称为“不确定性回归到社会”，**社会冲突不再被当作秩序问题而是被看作是风险问题**，风险问题的存在即没有确定的解决方案，**一种根本性的矛盾，对社会技术可行性失去信心是肯定的**。风险是无限再生的，伴随着人的决策，而**将世界描述成风险的人则失去行动力，控制意图的扩张和强化最终产生相反的效果**。**视野的增加只会告诉我们不该做什么以及何为错误，却无法得知我们应该做什么，它更倾向于自我批评**。\n\n## \n\n个性化理论是新的生活方式对工业社会的旧生活方式的抽离(the disembedding)再嵌入(re-embedding)，个人必须自己生产、上演和聚集自己的生活经验。阶级预设着核心家庭，核心家庭预设着男女分工，男女分工预设着婚姻。\n\n目前的政治建立在错误的范畴上，将政治等同于国家，政治等同于政治体系，人们希望在政治预设好的舞台上寻找政治，希望寻找适当的威权代理人，议会、政党、工会等发现政治，如果政治停摆，那有关政治的一切都将结束。\n\n政府结构的固定性导致了政治的消失，社会存在由社会组织亚政治地运转的可能性，工业社会的政治将转向非政治的。在这种情况下，矛盾的多样性参与存在，组建联合政府的热潮高涨，每个人可以同时是左派和右派，既激进又保守，既主张生态保护又反对保护生态，既悲观又乐观；社会不再是非黑即白的政治立场，一个新的行为社会即自我创造。\n\n## \n\n功能性系统分化(functional systemic differentiation)，有两个是可以确定的：女权革命，技术的可再生时代（Gernot Böhme 的 Über Natur Im Zeitalter Ihrer Technischen Reproduzierbarkeit，实在是读不下去，大概意思是自然界原有技术被人为复制，例如人造人相关的基因技术，仿生技术，复制自然的技术构建一个人为制造的自然功能以覆盖原本的自然，实现重组系统性功能），重组后的自然变成社会组成的一部分，自然变成利用基因技术去解决社会问题，需要重新自然化(renaturalization)即非自然(denaturalization)，转换成自然生产的工业体系被转化为能使社会变化持久的自然体系\n\n> 大家只须大胆地进行这个思想实验：一个男女真千平等的社会（不管它意味着什么样的细节）必定是一种新的现代性。妨碍这种社会成为现 实的屏障是由自然、人类学和家庭观念以及妇女有意予以配合的母性幸福感共同构筑的，但这是另外一回事。在许多妇女看来，它并不是由永久女权革命的失败所引起的、作为革命成功时我们即将面对的变化的衡星单位的所有震动中最轻微的震动。社会科学研究表明，形形色色的原教旨主义是父权制的反应，是重新制定男性“引力定律”的企图。\n\n这形成了一个自治的亚系统，技术的发展和应用将分权，例如一个国家的教育经费是通过公共（税收）收入和财政预算作为经费，能在自然获得的事物逐渐要从“社会的自然”中获取。\n\n在风险文明中，人民对专家和政府等权威组织的依赖加深，人民会认为面临危机“专家”们给出的建议更加理性和具有合法性，事实上更多的是公共政策和人民之间的对抗关系，这种矛盾建立在一个地区的盲目的风险文化中，因为科学不再是建立在经验主义上而是在数据、程序、生产等的基础上，所以这也否定了马克思“国家是阶级矛盾不可调和的产物”，这是实证也是历史，后传统社会并不需要一种给出答案的科学，它利用文化符号、依赖于媒体，有时缺乏实证依据，对历史的发生存在依赖性，也存在转换为宿命论的可能性。\n\n政治的种类\\\\政治的性质或阶段有规则的政治自反性政治政治的政治寻求政治增长、社会进步、技术发展、象征性的民主经济的重新激活或社会生活中自我认同的转变亚政治功能组别、官僚理性，企业支配，职业化的政治行动政治化的条件罢工、多数派当选、保险堵塞、封锁，在政治系统内外争取对现代化共识和改革\n\n## \n\n> Wo der Antheil sich verliert, verliert sich auch das Gedächtniss. 哪里没有兴趣，哪里就没有记忆。\n\n——Goethe\n\n记忆是一个动态的社会过程，从认知心理学来讲，记忆能是编码转换为长期记忆，又可通过意识回忆再学习为内隐的再认，这样的“再现”有可能是虚假的，只需要回忆当时情景的细节例如环境气氛、温度等就可辨别。\n\n在口述文化中，长者是传统的宝库和守护者，他们吸收传统比别人早，有更多的闲暇和其他同被鉴别传统的细节并传授给年轻人，所以传统是集体记忆的组织媒介(organizing medium of collective memory)，传统的完整性并不在与时间上的延续，而是不断的阐述，目的是发现连接现在与过去的纽带。集体记忆适应社会习俗\n\n参考资料：\n\nBazin, A.

{"id": "iCgOu9MNiussPAoEfsEBi4-BBWXfHVq3Y-9fmriQQvA", "title": "媒介本体论和现代化自反性", "body": "# 影像本体论\n\n不论是超级写实主义绘画、雕塑还是摄影，作品都一定带有主观性，只要存在人的介入，媒介本身的认识论会被虚拟化，而摄影是物理上对绘画的补充，然而它失去了色彩、透视、结构等层面的表现力，当选择使用摄影纪实，“纪实”是人的心理作用，事实是摄影后只是对人主观性的复制，通过构图、阴影、隐喻等构成人对可复制“纪实”的偏好。\n\n古代及宗教认为肉体不腐烂，生命将会得到延续，其关键在于和时间抗衡，以物理和化学上的处理变得“恒定“，现在的人体冷冻技术，同样不具备完善的科学根据，只是理论上冷冻人有机会复活，同样也是与时间抗衡而等待人类的技术发展，尽管人的器官和躯体能被完整保留，但神经元极其脆弱，解冻后的精神状态可能不再是生前的本人，我认为这是木乃伊情结的延申。\n\n> 一具用泡碱处理过的、干瘪的和呈深褐色的木乃伊，也就是古埃及的第一尊雕像。但是金字塔或通道中的迷宫不足以防止墓穴被盗，还要采取另外的保险措施，以防万一。所以在石棺附近，除了撒些小麦当作死者的食物外，还放上几尊陶制的小雕像，作为备用的木乃伊，死者躯体一旦毁坏，这些雕像便可充当替身。从雕塑艺术的这种宗教起源中，可以揭示它的原始功能：复制外形以保存生命。显然，在史前洞穴中发现乱箭穿身的泥雕熊表现了同种心愿更积极的一个方面：泥熊等同于活兽的神化物，为的是祈求狩猎成功。\n\n——《摄影影像的本体论》 \\[法\\]安德烈·巴赞 André Bazin\n\n木乃伊情结和人体冷冻技术属于对“人类本位”的追求，另一种将以媒介的方式帮助人们回忆，以至于不被人们遗忘，又或者说这种媒介方式创造了符合现实面貌而时间上独立存在的理想空间，例如现在的区块链技术有可能实现“永久性”且不被抹除地记录信息、著名的画师能够让人死后存在于形似的记忆和概念中；不再追求于本体的永生，转向满足于人对心理和精神满足的追求，从而克服人对时间流逝的需求。\n\n基于物理的技术能完好地保留了视觉上的客观性，人并不需要通过艺术手法主观地干预，摄影师只需要选择摄影对象，就能实现“纪实”，信息技术的存在能够使得摄影的结果能以数字的方式保存下来，而不再局限于画作存在腐朽的可能性，从媒介的角度上它实现了“存在的永生”，却不再是本体了，它满足的是场景、人被记录的那瞬间能够重现在面前，那种追忆和怀念。\n\n摄影和超写实主义绘画的区别在于数字化、物理上保留的客观性，后者保留了对美学的追求和幻想，当尽可能创造逼真程度，这种时候色彩则失去了表现力。\n\n前面提到的几何透视、阴影则在绘画和摄影的基础上制造幻象，最终导致摄影也如同绘画存在独特的美学，绘画也成为了摄影的对象。将绘画的美学意义（表现性）和心理意义（再现性）区分开。\n\n> 电影只是在造型艺术现实主义演进过程中最明显的表现，而现实主义的原理是随文艺复兴运动出现的，并且在巴罗克风格的绘画中得到了最极端的体现。\n\n几何透视之解决了形似，而无法体现物的运动，若是要追求幻象，则失去了造型上的艺术，要么使得复制品的瞬间表现有逼真，要么是象征、隐喻、造型超越了原型，前者为在虚拟中企图暗示“复制品”的真实和自然，后者为精神的表现力和对美的追求。\n\n> 在达到形似效果方面，绘画只能作为一种较低级的技巧，作为复现手段的一种代用品。唯有摄影机镜头下的客体影像能够满足我们潜意识提出的再现原物的需要，它比几可乱真的仿印更真切，因为它就是这件实物的原型。不过，它已经摆脱了时间流逝的影响。影像可能模糊不清，畸变褪色，失去纪录价值，但是它毕竟产生了被摄物的本体，影像就是这件被摄物。\n\n| 媒介 | 缘由 | “复制品” |\n\n| ---- | ---------- | -------------------- |\n\n| 绘画 | 木乃伊情结 | 主观重现，实现“永生” |\n\n| 摄影 | 写实主义 | 基于物理上的客观性 |\n\n# 自反性\n\n## 个人的自反性\n\n人具有的自反性指的是反思自己的言行、思想、道德等且加以修正，使用知识从而调整自己的行为，这是思想、知识影响行为的双向过程。\n\n若是行为被自反性改变，是行为的自我审视(reflexity monitoring of action)，道德方面最著名的例子是《论语·学而》“吾日三省吾身：为人谋而不忠乎？与朋友交而不信乎？传不习乎？”，根据约定习俗、社会规范以监视自我的行为规范是否一致，同时是约束自我行为的合理性根据。另一层次是检点行为的动机(motive,motivation)，尽管动机不一定能被社会接受，但它可以作为个人价值观的延申促成了做出行为的合理性。\n\n自反性除了反思道德，是以认识论的产物，对未意图后果(unintended consequences)和未认知的条件(unacknowledged conditions)的认识，从而分解出意图、目的、潜在意料之外，例如马克思解释的经济和生产条件、佛洛依德揭示潜意识动机。\n\n假如在一个资讯完全充分且有效的社会，有人打破防疫规定那么它在社会整体而言是不道德的行为。\n\n## 社会的自反性\n\n吉登斯认为人类已经将社会进行了解释性研究但又反过来被这些理论所影响，从而形成社会秩序，它并不是由自然进化而成，而是人为预先计划。事实是人们总是解释一个社会包含全部个体的行为，因此他们将不断发展自己的理解来调整行为，从而形成了社会周期，最终社会科学知识改变人类的活动，社会学服从双重解释。\n\n技术本身是对自然现象的利用和捕获，而社会科学大多建立于可解释性、它不能够像技术发展一样存在进化，因为可解释的集合中包含了拥有自反性的个体，每个人都有机会改变其状态，却又受环境的约束（行为主义），世界并非一个独立的观念却独立且排他性的被认识，而社会知识观念和世界存在相互的交流和作用，即“思想和行为的不断折射”。\n\n既然如此，社会将充斥着自反性带来的不确定性，这是可解释性或可回归之外。\n\n> 哲学家们只是用不同的方式解释世界，而问题在于改变世界。\n\n——《关于费尔巴哈的提纲》马克思\n\n可解释性和唯物现实的对立，存在因势利导的可能性，利用了人存在自反性的特征，这在索罗斯的反身性和金融心理学有实际应用。\n\n社会学本身是一种用以监控的知识，早在奥古斯特·孔德的社会物理学以自然科学的研究方法对社会秩序进行预测和控制，在现代化社会往往自反性更强，存在习俗和传统的松动和瓦解，称之为“后传统社会”，人越来越需要自己做抉择，无法依赖家庭、公会、政府，不能墨守成规。\n\n| | |\n\n| ------------------ | ------------------ |\n\n| 社会学论述 | 常识性知识 |\n\n| 现实世界或社会生活 | 社会行动或公共政策 |\n\n(互为自反关系)\n\n例如在选举之前不断地进行民调并发布民调，促使更多人选择从众，积极的预期产生正反馈，但它也取决于民众如何看待，反身性在资讯有效的情况下复杂得无法准确计量，导致民调总是难以预测选举结果。\n\n它打破了传统主客观的二元对立，一般客观来讲主体认识的过程不考虑客体的反向影响，因此获取的“知识”即认识论，而事实上是理论和真实相互对应，如果要了解一个对象，不以主体投射或情感影响，它要求自我约束保持理性和科学严谨作为主流学术的要求之一，最起码它们现在是科学的专业伦理。\n\n尽管在自然科学中，主客观二元对立也不是绝对的，海森伯发现测不准原理，粒子的动量和位置不可同时被确定，对例子进行测量必定会扰动该例子；双缝实验中光线在穿过两个竖条空隙之后，光屏上形成的是多条平行的竖纹，揭示了粒子的波粒二象性，即微观粒子具有波动性。\n\n在心理学中，实验的客观性围绕着招募志愿者进行控制变量的小范围实验，实验者可通过单面镜观测他们，而志愿者们却不知他们正在被窥见，因此得出这样的实验操作是“客观”的；另一种是自然实验，2021 年的诺贝尔经济学奖是基于一个自然实验，其中 David Card 围绕劳动经济学关于最低工资,一般来说移民通常定居于容易找到工作且高薪的地方，认为如果存在大量人口涌入，供给则增加，本地工人的可替代性更强，在马列尔事件发生大规模移民后，使得目的地 Miami 的工作人口在几个月内增长了 7%，对比 1980 年 Miami 和其他相似城市（对照组）同期的发展，尽管经历 80 年代经济衰退，但工资和失业率相比下大致相同，并没有说明马利托人的消极影响；这种最为接近严谨的随机对照试验但这样的环境并非学术实验刻意造成，自然实验将比自为制造的社会实验更有说服力，它允许了主体和客体之间在一段时间存在相互作用从而用时间检验移民政策的效用。\n\n## 媒介的自反性\n\n常规文学、电影等媒介往往刻意制造沉浸式的观感，告诉受众这是现实，使得受众将自我代入其中，例如电影中刻意隐藏摄像机以满足受众的窥见感；自反性则打破“这是真的”命题，反思现实主义，在人为制造和真实（逼真）制造矛盾和冲突，告诉自己这并不是真的，但我又要去面对这一题材，寻求其他的解决方案，常见于推理、悬疑，在虚的层面上去反思世界观和背景，这听起来像是对观众的玩弄，而观众对故事的合理性的反思将进一步推动情节，尽管不存在游戏上的交互，这种本我与故事的“我”的交流是利用了媒介本身的自反性，绘画可以是基于摄像的物理层面的创作，即痕迹上的创造，从本体论的角度来看，它刻意打造了存在的幻觉，可基于电影，通过精神上的感知构造了存在不同表现力的媒介，例如动画、戏剧，甚至是交互式电影，精神需求是实在的，但代入的同时它极力隐蔽了作品本身的主体性，以至于出现“被带着走”或“被误导”的情况，而这种设计正暗示着该故事的虚假性从而制造矛盾。\n\n## 符号的自反性\n\n在现代化社会中，传媒经济形成了符号经济学和空间经济学的研究和应用，前者可通过格雷马斯语义方阵等符号结构工具对传媒产品进行解剖，从而揭示特征基于经验主义制造“复制品”，从而形成消费文化和审美趋势，传媒符号化产品使得其组成内容不再重要，因为作为产品本身在互联网可以被快速获取，它更依赖于营销和销售方式的差异性。符号产品提供的是人主观对它的意义，而非实用，例如奢侈品和体验服务，符号价值可在空间上的文化结构被识别，称之为“符号近邻化”(Semiotic Neighborhoods).\n\n从媒介即认识论到皮尔斯的符号学理论，符号的三元结构必须同时拥有涉义(thought)、符号(symbol)、实物(object)，它否定了在生产过程中信息的内在意义，人能认知到符号是因人和符号之间的互动和交流，人赋予的意义并非一成不变，用认知神经科学的研究结果来讲，右脑参与了隐喻的理解，对应脑区的激活程度取决于隐喻的熟练度和理解程度，萨尔特曼隐喻诱引技术的依据是：大部分社会交流是非言语的，思想以图像形式出现，隐喻是认知的中心，观念的含义、理性、情感和经历体验共存。\n\n> 某个水果店经理在洋葱、胡萝卜陈列橱窗上贴了一幅标语：“全世界无产者，联合起来！”他这样做目的何在？究竟向人们传送什么信息？他是否对全世界无产者的大联合真的十分热衷？他当真觉得他的热情促使他非得让公众都来了解他的理想不可？他是否真的想过，这个大联合该怎么实现，实现了又怎么样？我敢断言，大多数商店经理们对于橱窗上标语的意义从来是不会过问的。他们也不会用那样的标语来表达自己真实的意见。标语是上面批发洋葱和胡萝卜的同时发下来的。水果店经理拿过来往橱窗上一贴就完事了，因为这是习以为常，司空习惯的事情。但要是不贴，就会有麻烦。上面会指责他不按规定布置橱窗，有人甚至会控告他反党反社会主义。为了过得下去，他非照章办事不可。这样的小事千千万万，做了才能有过上“与社会谐调一致”的生活保障。 水果商对于标语的内涵是不闻不问、无动于衷的。他不会有什么个人愿望来让公众了解标语表达的理想。这当然不是说水果商的举动毫无意义的，或者说标语什么都没告诉大家。标语确实是一个符号，包含了一个说不出口来但却十分明确的信息。口头上说起来，可以这样表达：“我，水果商某某，是懂得我该作什么，是守本分的。我是个靠得住的人，无可挑剔。我很听话，所以该过上平安日子。”这个符号当然有一个接受者，那就是水果商的上级领导；符号同时也是一个挡箭牌，用来防范那些揭发举报者。标语的真实意义因此深扎在水果商的生存之中，反映了他的根本利益。那么，什么是他的根本利益呢？\n\n——《无权者的权力——纪念扬·巴托契卡》哈维尔\n\n哈维尔将其归咎为这样的符号可以帮助他惟命是从的可鄙境界，同样掩盖了权势的可鄙基础，那就是后极权社会的维系产物——意识形态。该意识形态正是利用了符号自反性的欺诈性，水果商可能真不愿意参与其中却因此合理化自己的处境，但该符号的意义并非是内在的，它的传播让更多人陷入这个集体主义的陷阱，从而做些违背社会道德的事物而被合理化，除此之外它也可以掩盖人对政权和对失业等陷入不利情况的恐惧，企图让人被迫的相信制度本身是自然而成的；换而言之，符号的隐喻是人民能够通过加入这场运动从而改变社会进程，也可为自我开脱，现代人明确意识到政治形式具有人为构成的性质，从旧现实的意识和旧形式中抽离，嵌入政治进程。\n\n# 自反性现代化\n\n自反性现代化指的是工业社会时代的自我毁灭，而击溃它的不是西方现代化的危机而是胜利成果，如果说现代化是工业社会形态抽离并重新嵌合，那么自反性现代化指的是另一种社会形态为基础重新进行现代化进程；现代社会的内在活力削弱了阶级、阶层、职业、性别角色、核心家庭等在社会中的形成，也削弱了自然技术经济进步的连续性和条件。在这种情况下，进步可能会转化为自我毁灭，一种现代化化削弱并改变另一种现代化。资助的现代化过程可以是无意且非政治的，绕过了所有政治决策、路线冲突、党派之争。\n\n传统观念总是认为社会剧变往往意味着解体和痛苦，事实上贫富差距、财富累积等的坐标轴发生了变化，经济增长、技术进化和就业保障可以使得工业社会进入新的时代。\n\n> 想得到的 + 熟悉的 = 新的现代化\n\n——《再造政治：自反性现代化理论初探》乌尔里希・贝克\n\n## 风险社会\n\n工业社会被淘汰的另一面是风险社会,社会、政治、个人会极力避开工业社会的监督和保护制度.第一阶段为人民意识到这种制度引发的系统性风险和威胁,但这些问题往往是局部的而且未成为秩序冲突的核心,社会中越来越多的风险残余即由人决策产生的风险将被合理化的存在。 它带来的是全社会的不安全感。\n\n第二个阶段则出现了工业社会的危险支配整个社会，制度的失控成为了社会和政治矛盾，旧社会不得不根据工业社会的模式进行决策，利益组织、司法系统都会受到人为决策引发的风险溢出导致的争论和冲突。\n\n风险社会的产生是因人民对工业社会的自信，对寻求进步主义或寻求生态影响等危险的抽象化主导者社会人民和制度的思想和行动。\n\n**自反性(reflexive)指的是反思(relfection),而自反性现代化指的是自我对抗(self-confrontation)。现代化基础和后果的区别在于现代化自我反思层面上的知识和科学化的增加。**\n\n高风险和高机遇的集体将导致现代化后果的自我冲突，本质上在于社会的组成部分的责任分配冲突，具体来讲，工业社会无法控制现代化背后的风险，例如核技术、化工技术、基因研究、环境生态的迫害、过度军事化、贫富差距等。\n\n人民一旦意识到这些风险潜在的危机有可能超越了社会对安全和稳定的范畴，这些议题极有可能产生动摇社会秩序的前提假设，同时司法系统和政治决策也会成为一个特别议题。\n\n一般来说，GDP 的 expediture approach 计算并不包括家务、做饭等家庭事物，尽管这些是支持家庭成员劳动成为可能性的要素，但这些发生在家庭内，对整个社会来说是非排他性的。根本原因是自然资源是现代工业的基础但在现代化确立之后便逐渐消失，风险的存在在于制度基础的边缘化，然后阶级意识和进步的信念枯竭，导致个体(the individual)不得不成为个人(an individual)，**个人生活中的机遇和矛盾原本可以在家族、宗族、社会阻止等中得到解决，而现在越来越多由个人来感知和处理，非核心家庭名存实亡，核心家庭的数量减少。不平等的增加但阶级不平等和阶级意识已失去社会中的核心地位，自我不再是明确的自我，而是分裂为自我的矛盾话语。**\n\n在“后现代”社会中，个人必须掌握“风险机遇”，个人不能在“可靠”基础上做出抉择，必须考虑到行为可能的后果。（例如有交易经验的人能认识到“计划交易”的重要性）\n\n生态危机的本质是工业社会的一个制度性危机，技术工业的发展引起潜在威胁的不可预测性和失控的可能性，否则系统性的毁灭，人民将意识到需要一种新的自反性且自主自决的必要性，在风险社会中，社会具有狭义上的自反性，社会会成为自身的问题。\n\n这种充斥着不确定性和风险危机的现象被称为“不确定性回归到社会”，**社会冲突不再被当作秩序问题而是被看作是风险问题**，风险问题的存在即没有确定的解决方案，**一种根本性的矛盾，对社会技术可行性失去信心是肯定的**。风险是无限再生的，伴随着人的决策，而**将世界描述成风险的人则失去行动力，控制意图的扩张和强化最终产生相反的效果**。**视野的增加只会告诉我们不该做什么以及何为错误，却无法得知我们应该做什么，它更倾向于自我批评**。\n\n## 个性化和（亚）政治\n\n个性化理论是新的生活方式对工业社会的旧生活方式的抽离(the disembedding)再嵌入(re-embedding)，个人必须自己生产、上演和聚集自己的生活经验。阶级预设着核心家庭，核心家庭预设着男女分工，男女分工预设着婚姻。\n\n目前的政治建立在错误的范畴上，将政治等同于国家，政治等同于政治体系，人们希望在政治预设好的舞台上寻找政治，希望寻找适当的威权代理人，议会、政党、工会等发现政治，如果政治停摆，那有关政治的一切都将结束。\n\n政府结构的固定性导致了政治的消失，社会存在由社会组织亚政治地运转的可能性，工业社会的政治将转向非政治的。在这种情况下，矛盾的多样性参与存在，组建联合政府的热潮高涨，每个人可以同时是左派和右派，既激进又保守，既主张生态保护又反对保护生态，既悲观又乐观；社会不再是非黑即白的政治立场，一个新的行为社会即自我创造。\n\n## 第三条路\n\n功能性系统分化(functional systemic differentiation)，有两个是可以确定的：女权革命，技术的可再生时代（Gernot Böhme 的 Über Natur Im Zeitalter Ihrer Technischen Reproduzierbarkeit，实在是读不下去，大概意思是自然界原有技术被人为复制，例如人造人相关的基因技术，仿生技术，复制自然的技术构建一个人为制造的自然功能以覆盖原本的自然，实现重组系统性功能），重组后的自然变成社会组成的一部分，自然变成利用基因技术去解决社会问题，需要重新自然化(renaturalization)即非自然(denaturalization)，转换成自然生产的工业体系被转化为能使社会变化持久的自然体系\n\n> 大家只须大胆地进行这个思想实验：一个男女真千平等的社会（不管它意味着什么样的细节）必定是一种新的现代性。妨碍这种社会成为现 实的屏障是由自然、人类学和家庭观念以及妇女有意予以配合的母性幸福感共同构筑的，但这是另外一回事。在许多妇女看来，它并不是由永久女权革命的失败所引起的、作为革命成功时我们即将面对的变化的衡星单位的所有震动中最轻微的震动。社会科学研究表明，形形色色的原教旨主义是父权制的反应，是重新制定男性“引力定律”的企图。\n\n这形成了一个自治的亚系统，技术的发展和应用将分权，例如一个国家的教育经费是通过公共（税收）收入和财政预算作为经费，能在自然获得的事物逐渐要从“社会的自然”中获取。\n\n在风险文明中，人民对专家和政府等权威组织的依赖加深，人民会认为面临危机“专家”们给出的建议更加理性和具有合法性，事实上更多的是公共政策和人民之间的对抗关系，这种矛盾建立在一个地区的盲目的风险文化中，因为科学不再是建立在经验主义上而是在数据、程序、生产等的基础上，所以这也否定了马克思“国家是阶级矛盾不可调和的产物”，这是实证也是历史，后传统社会并不需要一种给出答案的科学，它利用文化符号、依赖于媒体，有时缺乏实证依据，对历史的发生存在依赖性，也存在转换为宿命论的可能性。\n\n| 政治的种类\\\\政治的性质或阶段 | 有规则的政治 | 自反性政治 |\n\n| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n\n| 政治的政治 | 寻求政治增长、社会进步、技术发展、象征性的民主 | 经济的重新激活或社会生活中自我认同的转变 |\n\n| 亚政治 | 功能组别、官僚 | 理性，企业支配，职业化的政治行动 |\n\n| 政治化的条件 | 罢工、多数派当选、保险 | 堵塞、封锁，在政治系统内外争取对现代化共识和改革 |\n\n## 后传统社会\n\n> Wo der Antheil sich verliert, verliert sich auch das Gedächtniss. 哪里没有兴趣，哪里就没有记忆。\n\n——Goethe\n\n记忆是一个动态的社会过程，从认知心理学来讲，记忆能是编码转换为长期记忆，又可通过意识回忆再学习为内隐的再认，这样的“再现”有可能是虚假的，只需要回忆当时情景的细节例如环境气氛、温度等就可辨别。\n\n在口述文化中，长者是传统的宝库和守护者，他们吸收传统比别人早，有更多的闲暇和其他同被鉴别传统的细节并传授给年轻人，所以传统是集体记忆的组织媒介(organizing medium of collective memory)，传统的完整性并不在与时间上的延续，而是不断的阐述，目的是发现连接现在与过去的纽带。集体记忆适应社会习俗\n\n参考资料：\n\nBazin, A.

In many cases, these creative DAOs retain an element of centralization; for example, while filmmaking DAO Decentralized Pictures allows token holders to vote for a shortlist of film projects to win funding, the final decision on which project receives the award is made by a board of judges.\n\n## What's special about AcrossDAO ?\n\nAcrossDAO is a community-driven DAO, a DeFi protocol that belongs to the cross-chain bridge field\n\nAcrossDAO is a community-driven DAO, a DeFi protocol that belongs to the cross-chain bridge field This ensures that Across has a strong technical team and community, yes, the community is our strength, we develop in the community, contribute to the community, discuss, learn, and vote together. It's an amazing act to discuss doing something together. I love so much.\n\nDAO：edit：Stephen Graves  chainchen ", "timestamp": 1657162696, "digest": "KGD1uMGlO7BGRynsd7PEgsqoxQZjyfgvAsie8vQsI6U", "contributor": "0xf97A3bc05f4D7e360E64c9ff9935b66f8334BaAA"}

{"id": "MrLrDnI9NPqr3gNAAXukEVFPgg3-SeY8D_NiLcAuEyo", "title": "163期社区例会|三大NFT交易平台分享", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hpdRl_8DK3rBm513GAhuJ.png?height=395&width=702)\n\n本周跟大家分享下三大NFT交易平台：OpenSea 、 LooksRare 、 X2Y2\n\n### 一、OpenSea\n\nOpensea成立于2018年，是全球最大 NFT 交易平台，由毕业于布朗大学的Devin Finzer和毕业于斯坦福大学Alex创立。该综合平台售卖的数字商品多种多样，包括数字艺术品、加密收藏品、游戏物品等。在 OpenSea 平台上，用户可以与世界上任何一个人进行代币买卖和交换。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A2Qysu0rR0RVMmxqVBUV2.png?height=459&width=1345)\n\n据DUNE数据显示，opensea占据市场绝大部分份额，2022年4月，日交易用户超过22万，达到小高峰。6月份活跃人数超5万。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RGjQ8xt6ZYmGqUYAXeRXH.png?height=443&width=1285)\n\n目前，OpenSea 收费较其他传统平台例如苏富比、佳士得相比，佣金收取相对较高，买家交易费约 2.5%，其他佣金收费，如游戏道具，需收取游戏项目方 7.5% 费用。苏富比、佳士得拍卖艺术收藏品收取买家佣金约为 12-25%，收取卖家佣金约为 2%-9%。因此，相比较于传统艺术品拍卖行而言，这个佣金价格也是相对较低的。\n\n**关于开发团队**\n\n2018 年 1 月，Alex Atallah 和 Devin Finzer 打下了 OpenSea 平台的基础。两人拥有 Palantir、加利福尼亚大学伯克利分校、谷歌、斯坦福大学、Facebook 和 Pinterest 的背景，专业知识精湛，组成了一支经验丰富的强大团队。\n\nAlex Atallah：<https://twitter.com/xanderatallah>\n\nDevin Finzer：<https://twitter.com/dfinzer>\n\n大家如果玩OpenSea，应该就对这个平台不陌生\n\n平台界面设计得比较清晰简介，分类很明确。主要分为5部分，explore、stats、resources、create、profile。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OmTflrpObch0bV8MNppsY.png?height=299&width=1294)\n\nexplore里可以按照分类发现nft，如ART\\\\MUSIC\\\\SPORTS等。或者直接在搜索栏搜索目标NFT。\n\nstats可以查看以太坊、polygon、solona、klayth链上NFT排名。\n\nresource中可以看到跟opensea相关的内容，例如合作方、开发者文档等。\n\ncreate一栏，所有人可在这里发布自己的NFT，过程很简单，上传自己的NFT，设定价格，支付服务费和gas费就可以发布。\n\n点击自己的头像”profile”可以查看账户里的NFT，设置watchlist，添加自己感兴趣的NFT。\n\n出售和购买也比较方便。\n\n创建：小狐狸钱包里注意切换以太坊或者polygon等网络，确认自己发布NFT的网络。上传NFT，输入名称，价格、出售期限，链接钱包签名，即可创建自己的NFT。\n\n跟着流程走，需要什么填什么，很easy。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pciO1yi7-DxdBvxKkJ2Ws.png?height=424&width=789)\n\n出售：出售分为两种，一种是常规出售，设定价格即可出售。另一种是拍卖形式，输入价格和时间，即可在规定的时间进行拍卖。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PO7eRpd2Yp5W84m_thgB5.png?height=993&width=1217)\n\n**购买：**点进NFT页面，可以看到所有该项目的所有NFT，包括项目数量、交易量、holders、地板价等等。还有项目方的推特、官网、DC等网站。看到喜欢的NFT，可直接链接钱包购买，也可以使用moopay进行支付，根据指导步骤进行就可以。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uweTBlb7W-jVz0sidn5cE.png?height=995&width=2193)\n\n总的来说，opensea收藏品多，信息齐全，作为一个老牌nft交易平台，积累了大量用户。在操作使用中不是很难，对小白来说比较友好，能很快上手。\n\n因为网站知名加上项目众多，opensea上不可避免的会出现很多假冒知名项目进行诈骗的“仿盘”，“仿盘”毫无任何价值，用户可通过项目NFT总量、拥有者、地板价和交易量等维度进行分辩。\n\n所以，无论到哪都要注意，看好自己的财产。\n\n### 二、LooksRare\n\nLooksRare是社区优先的NFT市场，2022年1月上线，由一个匿名团队开发和发布。该平台对玩家的活跃参与会有奖励，参与类型包括质押平台代币 $LOOKS和$WETH、交易、挂单三种行为。\n\nWebsite：<https://looksrare.org/>\n\nTwitter：<https://twitter.com/LooksRare>\n\n平台总账户数量达到97.67k。累计交易账户数量达到242.93k。\n\n![过去七天的交易情况](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5LL0I3NsWyQ8G8DWus92s.png?height=253&width=2418)\n\n说一下它的开发团队，创始人Zodd，推特主页：<https://twitter.com/ZoddLooksRare>\n\n关于Zodd和其它联合创始人身份，属于半透明状态。\n\n![其它成员的信息](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G4xWVIhyha3NdnwU6Ol36.png?height=687&width=609)\n\n在佣金方面，LooksRare对所有NFT交易收取2%的手续费，低于OpenSea的2.5%。\n\n接下来，LooksRare将推出V2版本。\n\n据称，这将是 LooksRare 核心产品的下一个演变，会带来巨大的 \"升级\"，包括以下几方面的变化：\n\n1）额外的 LOOKS 应用场景；2）增加的新功能；3）新的订单类型；4）平台级别的激励措施；5）Gas 优化。\n\nLooksRare V2 协议目前已经在开发中。\n\nopensea属于全面性较强的产品，各个功能非常清晰，便于新手上手。LooksRare则是针对性强，侧重于交易，适合NFT老玩家和想要获得收益的玩家。\n\nLooksRare的整体板面重点突出，主要是“盈利”。从上到下都展示了在这个平台，用户能够花费更少的资金，最大程度的获得收益。这也是这个平台最大的特色。\n\n关于购买，可以直接购买，也可以进行报价购买，直接购买可以使用WETH和ETH。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pb5EgCxKn_XCvLWqhyiSm.png?height=606&width=770)\n\n或者进行报价购买。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YC5lo_XaS1Zg27mGCaEdU.png?height=846&width=793)\n\n账户里的nft可以直接挂单。\n\n与OpenSea不同的是，挂单和交易NFT赚取平台代币$LOOKS。\n\n通过合格的挂单来赚取积分。积分每天会兑换成 $LOOKS 。在 LooksRare 上购买或出售任何 NFT，都可获得交易奖励（私人交易除外）。奖励每天发放一次。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/W4d0WhzNcaHkjdeUBec8B.png?height=445&width=702)\n\n符合挂单条件的NFT的标准：来自于24小时滚动交易量排名的前25个系列（排名每10分钟更新）。\n\n质押$LOOKS可以获得平台的交易费用，还有额外的奖励。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JmTRmjXFTM7nRTuAjwcAY.png?height=470&width=1177)\n\n相较于OpenSea来说，LooksRare的优势：\n\n手续费更低：LooksRare对所有NFT交易收取2%的手续费，低于OpenSea的2.5%。 \n\n可使用WETH或ETH两种代币购买：在OpenSea上用户想要购买时只能使用ETH进行购买，但如果手上只有WETH就需要消耗Gas fee进行转换，LooksRare则可以混合支付。 \n\n平台手续费100%返还给LOOKS质押者：在LooksRare把手续费奖励给LOOKS质押者，且用户分到的不是平台币，而是WETH，这会吸引到更多使用者去质押LOOKS。\n\n一键报价：对许多想买NFT的使用者来说，他们其实不太在意买的长怎样，只要拥有就可以了，所以LooksRare让使用者可以对你喜欢的NFT系列做一键报价，非常的方便。这同时也会增加这个系列NFT的流动性。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kVFI70xp5yvob_aeJFMqC.png?height=1008&width=1304)\n\n支持四种语言：支持中、英、西班牙语、法语四种语言；DC内也有中文频道，对中国用户比较友好。\n\n创作者即时版税收益：OpenSea通常是每两周领一次，而LooksRare则是卖出当下就会收到，使创作者可以更快速拿到流动资金。\n\n但也存在一些缺点：\n\n1、平台侧重交易，不能creat自己的nft，用户无法体验创作过程，这就需要到OpenSea上进行创作。\n\n2、只支持以太坊主网，不支持其它链。\n\n3、平台建设时间不久，所以在用户数量、交易量等方面数据远低于OpenSea\n\n### 三、X2Y2 \n\nNFT交易平台X2Y2于2022年2月上线。旨在构建一个真正去中心化且让用户们共享收益的 NFT 交易平台。盈利模式为通过向nft卖家收取手续费。\n\n官网：<https://x2y2.io/>\n\n推特：<https://twitter.com/the_x2y2>\n\n据nftgo.io最新数据显示，去中心化NFT交易市场X2Y2交易额已突破18亿美元，截止目前为16.5亿美元，交易者总量为65,355。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UErcc4dqTyzzRAnBltUOq.png?height=547&width=2396)\n\n市场份额上，X2Y2正迅速占领市场，一路攀升，6月26日，已超50%。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SGY4u5hwdjv2SGoFEvm0H.png?height=754&width=1371)\n\n势头还是很猛的\n\n关于团队：X2Y2 团队匿名，营销合作伙伴为总部位于新加坡的加密营销公司Winkrypto。 创始人TP，推特主页：<https://twitter.com/tp_x2y2>\n\nTP偶尔会接受采访。在采访中，他称，X2Y2团队在2017年就进入了区块链行业，而且也都是OpenSea的老用户。具有一定的行业经验和背景。\n\n手续费收取方面：X2Y2之前收取交易用户2%的手续费，收取的手续费100%奖励给质押用户。 X2Y2的手续费在4月份为0%。5月1日起为0.5%。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P23vE2gid_9PuWYkC9lek.png?height=278&width=1362)\n\nX2Y2也有质押奖励和交易奖励。\n\n质押奖励，跟DEFI挖矿是一样的，就是用户将代币质押到官方平台，平台按照一定的年化收益率给你奖励代币，同时现在质押代币，也能获得平台的手续费分成，以 wETH 形式从卖家那里收取的费用将按比例分配给 X2Y2 质押者。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c73uBu0ebTWSVYhJI3R5l.png?height=426&width=1241)\n\n平台每天向 NFT 卖家和买家分发 624,902 个 X2Y2 代币，以鼓励交易。  在购买和出售上，几个平台都大同小异，大家可以去体验一下。  如果有不明白的，可以随时问我！  \n\nX2Y2的优势有以下几方面:\n\n 1、手续费更低：对所有NFT交易收取0.5%的手续费，低于其它平台。手续费是100%分给质押x2y2代币的用户\n\n2、X2Y2可以批量上架NFT，也可以批量购买NFT\n\n3、加入购物车功能，喜欢的NFT可以先加入购物车，便于和其它NFT一起结算。使用购物车功能，可以最多节省约40%的gas费。\n\n4、平台列举了x2y2、opensea、looksrare平台上按照交易量排名的NFT并进行一键购买。\n\n5、隐藏。如果你不想别人看到你持有某个nft或者某一些nft，可隐藏。\n\n缺点也是平台不能creat自己的nft，用户无法体验创作过程，这就需要到OpenSea上进行创作。  \n\n现在来总结一下，在使用难度上：因为OPENSEA没有交易奖励和质押奖励，所以使用难度要小一点，更适合新手使用。OPENSEA能够创建NFT，所以适合所有人使用，每个人都能list nft。\n\n在用户数方面和交易数量方面。OPENSEA更胜一筹。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ryv9FUZurh8stvcwUlgU6.png?height=563&width=2450)\n\n市场占有率和交易量上，X2Y2现在是涌上潮头。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ChCQ412vOamxHjupApPmE.png?height=605&width=1280)\n\n就NFT市场现状而言，OpenSea仍是当前的领头羊，X2Y2处于挑战者的低位。短期还未能对OpenSea造成威胁，大部分的用户买卖NFT首选依然是OpenSea平台 ，但LooksRare和X2Y2或许能有更大的挑战机遇。  最后分享给大家两个网站，自己也可以去实时查看平台数据 \n\nNFTGo：<https://nftgo.io/analytics/marketplace>\n\nDUNE：\n\n[https://dune.com/browse/dashboards](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards)\n\n",

胡子观币：**胡子观币的OG，也是AvatarDAO的MOD。21年初进币圈，之前有9年的A股交易经验，擅长领域是NFT和二级交易市场。\n\n**j.eth：**NFT爱好者，DegenToonz持有人，该项目被盗次数相对较多，与大家分享经历和应对措施。\n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥：**DegenToonz中文社区管理人，本身是一名程序员，进入币圈5年左右，现在更多精力在于找寻优质的NFT项目。\n\n  \n\n**话题一：在钱包和NFT交易平台使用中，有哪些NFT的安全常识？**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**有个朋友曾想把他的一个NFT转走，不断的往钱包里面冲gas费，然后黑客就不断的转走，这黑客应该是写了一个监控工具加一个机器人。往钱包里冲多少，他就能转出多少，所以他就一直没办法把NFT转出来。我们自己是之前在韩国女友还有杀手女友比较火的时候买了不少，结果被一个钓鱼网站骗了。我们没有在官方的discord里面，然后有人私信我们，他就说可以低价买。因为之前也没有这种经验，所以就点进去了。点完了之后，他是要求你钱包去签名去授权，然后没有仔细看就点确定了，他就得到这个所有的NFT的，一个授权、签名，所以这个NFT就全部被转走了。那这个是平台，一定要在正规的交易平台，比如说opensea，looks这些，然后你要去识别平台的域名等，看这个平台是不是一个正规的平台，或者是不是官方的mint界面，一般这种官方mint界面，他都会写在项目方的Twitter主页或者discord他会专门开一个频道。关于这个钱包来说呢？其实就是对于用户自己来讲，就是要把这个私钥保存好。不能把私钥写在一些云笔记或者云盘上面，这个是非常危险的。因为一旦这种中心化的云笔记产品或者云盘，他们的这个服务器有漏洞或者安全威胁的话，那你这个私钥有黑客拿工具去扫满足这个私钥格式的内容。然后他一般脱完库之后，比如说云笔记的数据库被脱了之后呢，黑客就直接在这个被拖的这个数据库里面去寻找对应格式的私钥，然后他会去批量做一个转账处理。所以这个时候不能把这个私钥放在云盘上面，或者放在云笔记上面，建议的话就是最好私钥自己用纸写下来，或者自己用冷钱包管理自己的主账号，去玩NFT或者去打土狗的时候，用一些小号，这就是我个人的一个经验，一个防范的措施。\n\n \n\n**Piaoxue.eth|胡子观币：**补充几点我自己的一些习惯，我的每个钱包都会控制一下，就比方说NFT，有些单个也比较贵，那基本就贵的那些，每一个钱包就放这个NFT，然后别的什么也不放，我还有时候隔一段时间会把这个钱包里的全都转到一个新钱包，就因为之前有一些授权，可能自己点了也就忘记了，你要是去取消我不太会操作，我就直接去建一个新的，把它转过去。然后第2个就是不要随便点那些链接，很多都会给空投吗？我自己是从来不点，也不会领。然后discord，私信也都不会看的，总体就是减少这个风险暴露。平台我自己只用opensea、looks和X2Y2这3个，别的都没有用过。私钥，刚才老师说的这个私钥不要放在云盘上，然后我实际就放在云盘上，但我是把那个私钥的首尾2个地方颠倒过来了，就是那个字母跟数字颠倒过来，这样相当于如果是他拿到了也不一定能看得明白，或者说他直接复制也用不了。还有一个就是我自己一直想了解，但是我自己没用过，就是定期清理授权这个。我不知道有没有哪个老师能帮我讲一下，因为我之前看到过别人也是建议，定期就给钱包把授权都取消一遍。如果这个有谁知道，也教教我。\n\n \n\n**WaTell：**他这个东西其实挺简单的，因为我们现在购买NFT一般都是用这个MateMask小狐狸钱包，浏览器上会有一个MetaMask的这个插件，我们点开这个插件之后，他这个页面上在你的名字或者说在你的那个域名那一行其实有一个3个小点，就竖着的小点，然后你点开之后它有四项最下边是一项就是这个已连接的网站。然后她一点开之后就能看到你用这个钱包连接过哪些网站连接过哪些域名，你把你那些不想继续连接的这些网站取消掉，就点那个断开就可以了。这个东西其实还挺简单的，然后也挺安全的。我一般每次交互完一个网站，或者说mint完一个之后，就会把这个网站的连接给断开。\n\n \n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥：**我可以补充一点就是，你要清除授权的话，你也可以以太坊浏览器上面。它上面有一个标题栏，有一个就是token approve，你就可以从那里看到你当前连接的钱包有哪些授权你也可以从那里清除授权。钱包，我现在用的钱包就是2个钱包。一个Trust Wallet钱包，加上Meta Mask是我用到的，我现在的话，分了3个钱包就3种类型的，一个就是我从来不会动的差不多也算冷钱包是只进不出的，另外一个就是热钱包是只在opensea进行一个买卖的，另外一个就是小号，小号就是专门用来冲一些土狗mint。交易平台，我现在只会用opensea，还有looks。基本上还是在opensea，也不建议去其他平台。我说的其他交易平台就是，简单举个例子，假如说，我在discord加入了其他社群，就会有一堆人来私信你，你也不知道他干啥的，但是他会给你发个链接，一般像这种的情况下都是诈骗的。\n\n \n\n**j.eth：**现在黑客的手段非常多。我自己说一下我的立场吧。我是一个从币圈过来的，但是怎么发的家呢？那个狗狗跟屎币，然后进入NFT的那个时间，大约也就是半年左右,其实我觉得跟那个虚拟货币的区别不大，现在这个市场和去年的那个币圈的市场大约也是同一个时间，土狗层出不穷，而且各种各样，和那些不一样的是，NFT有各种各样可以获取的渠道，Freemint呀或者是进入到他们自己的网站mint呀，这些其实都需要授权的。然后其实黑客他可以把你东西盗走的，无非也就是从通过授权盗走，或者是通过你给的合约盗走，或者是盗取你的钱包，对吧？我首先第一点先从钱包上面来说的话，就是大家下载钱包一定要去官方网站下载。我曾经很多币圈的朋友就是因为去加telegram的社区。然后他们有的时候会给到一些什么这个钱包更新了呀，大家要用这个钱包去下载更新啊。可能咱们就点进去这个东西里面所有的一切跟正常的钱包是一模一样的。但唯一不一样的就是他能拿走你的钱包里面所有的钱。我大部分高质量的也就是价格相对较高的NFT，会有一个新钱包，这个新钱包呢，就是我觉得可以长期持有的，我都会放到硬件钱包里。另一些，比如Freemint呀，或者是我觉得不会持有太久，就会那个出逃获利的。我也是拿新钱包。就是拿几个新钱包去Freemint把这个gas正常花了之后，我再转到我的集中的一个钱包里面，大家可能在NFT圈，discord里面，他们有一个很常见的那个骗人的手段就是跟你私信说这个东西要免费mint了或者是怎么。他们和一些普通的那个网站还不太一样，进去之后，它上面会显示mint的数量，它会不断的变高，那意思就是你要是现在买，他马上就没了。我的第一次NFT被骗mint的就是这么来的。还有一个就是，现在很多类型的免费的空投，上面显示一个非常高的Offer。有人试过了，点了同意了Offer之后你的NFT就没了钱也没了。但是我可能那个对于程序员这方面代码不太了解，具体它是什么一个原理。\n\n \n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**关于刚刚说的那个空投。我们有专门去研究过它的合约逻辑，他们会利用一些数据平台，然后他们会筛选出一批高质量的客户，比如说你持有bayc这种蓝筹持有者，他们会筛选出一批这样的地址。然后他们会写一个相当于广告NFT的合约，它能自动的在生成的时候，就把这个广告的这些小图片直接空投到你地址上去。他直接利用这种方式，就相当于流氓广告一样，反正你又不能拒收，第三步就会写一个程序，对你的这个广告的NFT去做非常高价的Offer。当然他也会评估你的资产和他Offer的这个钱，一个价值衡量。如果他是有的赚的，那他就给你Offer，然后Offer完了之后，他会改那个合约里面的相关的函数。他会加一个流氓逻辑就是说你如果接受这个Offer，就要对这些NFT的资产做一个approve，你一旦approved之后，他就可以把你的所有的NFT全转走了，这个是比较形成产业化了，有不少黑客已经批量的在这么干了。这个技术手段比较高的，所以说也非常的防不胜防。\n\n \n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥：**我补充一下，刚刚说的这个问题，我也是经常收到一些空投到我钱包里面，有两个，一个是你点进去的时候它有个详情。在左边描述里面有很多链接，如果你是点了这里面的链接的话，就会被盗了，诈骗就是通过点了这个网址被骗的。然后另外一种就是，我也没去尝试啊，就是钱包里面经常有一些在head里面的他给你Offer这种我没有去接受啊，就是这种的话，是很早之前的了，但是我没去做，就是他会给你一个很高的Offer。\n\n \n\n**WaTell：**我简单总结了一下，有很多点和我这个经历是一样的。我所有的钱包的助记词还有这个私钥都是全都是记录到我的一个本子上，而且是要记录两次，因为我怕记录一次的话会记错了，到时候就没办法找回这个钱包了。还有一点非常重要，就是主动私聊你的基本上都是骗子。这个东西是非常需要大家谨记一句话。就像飘雪哥，他那个私钥虽然是保存在网盘里，但是它会把那个首尾字母颠倒一下。然后猫哥是把这个密码本保存在自己的大脑里，通过自己这种储存习惯，然后来进行一种助记词的这种存储。这种习惯还真的蛮有趣，因为黑客可以盗取你的这种信息，但是他永远都不会知道你大脑里的这种密码本的习惯。所以说如果大家是真的很懒不像我一样就是一个字一个字把它记下来那你们可以去学一下飘雪哥还有猫哥这种方法。然后还有一点就是大家使用这个MetaMask的时候进行交互，那个插件会有一个弹窗会提醒你，是要求你授权还是要求你签名？这个网站要求是你进行授权的话，那我们千万不要进行这个点击确定，因为要求你进行授权的这些网站，基本上99%全都是那种钓鱼网站，或者骗子网站，真正的正规的网站，它要求你进行交互的时候，只是会要求你进行一个签名，是绝对不可能要求你进行授权的。然后最后一点，就是官方网站的问题。我搜索框里输入了X2y2网站，然后我点击搜索结第一行，他是一个骗子网站，它一般前面都会有2个字就是广告。我有一个朋友前几天就经历过这样的事情，他来进行一个网站交互的时候，他点击了那个前面会有一个广告提示那个网站，然后他进去之后不仅进行了交互，而且他那个网站提示你私钥就是那个助记词出现了问题，他还把那个助记词输入了然后，就被盗取了蛮多钱的。所以说大家就是在网上冲浪的时候一定不要图快就是慢一步其实有的时候会帮你减少很多损失，这也是我的一个经验吧。我其实是一个非常严格执行这些条例的人，所以我基本上web3世界完全没有被盗过一次。\n\n \n\n \n\n**话题二：NFT有哪些被盗风险？**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**我们之前总结过，就是被盗主要有哪几种形式，第一种就是邮件，邮件钓鱼就是黑客会批量的给邮箱去发钓鱼网站的邮件，第2种就是高仿的域名，他可能花钱买广告了然后他就排在这个前面。第3种，就是MetaMask的假钱包。比如说到了他的网站上之后，它会弹出来一个跟MetaMask长得一模一样的这个弹窗你以为浏览器的插件弹出来的钱包弹窗，其实它是利用前端的效果做得跟那个弹窗几乎一模一样，然后第4种，就是很多discord机器人给你发DM，最后一个呢就是官方的这种discord被盗了，那这个时候就要有一定自己的识别和甄别能力，我大概总结就是这几种。\n\n \n\n**Piaoxue.eth|胡子观币：**我补充一点就是有一个私钥泄露的风险。比方说有一些账号，他可能是社区共管的这种类型，那可能有别的人，比方说在复制的这个私钥的过程中，它的这个输入法也是存在一个泄露风险的，可能是在这种情况下把私钥泄露出去，最后导致这个钱包被盗。\n\n \n\n**j.eth：**个人经历的话其实更多的被盗的应该是我在玩币的时候，NFT现在应该算是老油条了，应该是不太会被盗走，其实说白了就是不要点假的链接，不要相信任何天上掉下的馅饼，不要想到占便宜，自己什么也没付出，突然发一笔横财再多说一句，就是我的私钥和我的助记词怎么弄呢？都是抄下来之后放在了保险箱里。我觉得没有任何东西会比保险箱更加的保险。\n\n \n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥：**其实刚刚Allen已经说的很全了。我举2个例子，他刚刚说的邮件，在opensea进行换合约的时候，有很多人收到了假的邮件，那次的损失是比较惨重的。另外一次，在猴的地要出来的时候，提前mint猴地的链接，损失了好一部分。然后后来有一次，猴子的discord又被盗了，几个人也是受到伤害了。我想说的就是即便你关注的是推特或者是discord或者是ins，你都要想到这些都是可能被盗的。大家这个意识一定要警惕，然后第2个就是在你点授权的时候可以看一下小狐狸弹出来那个信息，看一下它是不是安全的。\n\n \n\n**WaTell：**大家可以考虑搞一个这种冷钱包，我们基本上有那么几个旧手机，就是重新设置一下出厂设置，在那个就手机上下载一个MetaMask，然后完全不连接网络，你的手机手动的变成那个冷钱包。怎么去鉴别这些风险其实也是蛮重要的一个东西，因为现在很多骗局和骗子这个技术，它确实太高，不光我们在与时俱进，骗子的骗术，这个技术也在时刻进步，让我们这些NFT玩家基本上就是防不胜防。然后还有这个之前出现这种给你传一个PDF文件，都能把你的这个钱包全都给盗走了。\n\n \n\n \n\n**话题三：如何鉴别NFT的潜在风险？**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**我觉得首先就是提高自己的一个鉴别和认知能力。如果你不能看懂代码，你可以利用一些工具，直接告诉你这个合约它是不是只能买不能卖的，或者是不是一个貔貅合约。第2个，我觉得做任何操作都不要着急，比如说你想去mint一个新的NFT，去查一下，比如说推特发的东西，去社群里面真正感受一下，再去做一些投资决策，或者做一些交互的决定。我还想补充的一点就是这个web3这个领域的玩家，其实很多人刚刚进来，没有很强的认知能力或者识别风险的能力，所以我觉得从两方面可以对这个问题去做一些有效的解决方案吧。第一方面我觉得我们要推动这种防盗意识这个科普，这个是我们从业人员或者说进来已经玩了很久了这些人应该去帮他们去搭建一个未来，让他们进来的时候有一个比较好环境。第2个，我觉得我们作为技术人员，应该得有一些自己创新的意识，或者说想要去解决这些问题的一个冲动，不能说这个合约它一成不变，黑客就是掌握绝对的话语权，用自己的技术，能力去跟他们做一个挑战。比如说我们可以在这个合约上做创新，或者去发展硬件。\n\n \n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**这个就引申到就是我们之前自己也是被盗了。之前我们是在互联网做安全相关的事情。代码分析这种，我们这个web2领域是属于安全意识非常高的。那来到web3领域之后，即使是我们这样的安全团队也会被黑客攻击，被黑客去钓鱼，那我觉得对于其他的这些小白不能让他们也跟我们一样，一进来，这个钱就损失了。所以我们自己在这个技术上面做了一些创新，我们就是要做一个你盗不走的NFT，比如说NFT长时间决定了要当钻石手不想卖了，那我可以帮在合约上面去加一个函数去帮助你把这个NFT锁起来，就是说你无论怎么样，这个NFT都转不走，除非你自己某一天想要卖了你就可以到我们的这个平台上去把这个NFT解锁，这个时候它才能被交易才能被转让。所以说，一旦你的私钥被盗了，黑客还得去突破第2层去到网站上去解锁。那解锁的时候我们是要求用户提供手机验证码或者邮箱验证码或者谷歌验证码，这个时候，黑客光攻击你的私钥外他还得把你的邮箱也盗了。所以我们觉得，符合用户的一个使用习惯，因为不管是币安或者说discord，都有邮箱验证这些措施。\n\n \n\n**WaTell：**咱们在这个自己的网站上又进行了一次防护，帮助持有者进行保管？那我想知道这个保管过程也安全吗？会不会黑客先把咱们这个网站给攻破，然后通过这里面数据库再去攻占其他的这些网站呢？\n\n \n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**实现这个其实也不简单，首先我们要去做链下的预言机，然后通过预言机去控制这个NFT的组合，然后去实现加锁解锁。这个后台服务器是拥有对这个预言机的最高权限，所以说这个时候就会带来一个问题如果我们的这个网站崩了，或者被黑客打挂了，他就可以随意的加解锁，我们解决这个问题是分为2步，前期我们肯定会使用一些中心化安全防护，后面会把网站去迁移到去中心化的算力的网络上面，这个就保证第一个我们自己人是没法做恶的，因为它是一个去中心化的部署应用。第2个，防止了单点脆弱性，不会因为一个点被打挂了，整个这个链路就崩溃了。\n\n \n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥：**我觉得很简单的判断方法就是，每天都有这么多新的项目，你首先看一下他这个NFT有没有成交量？这是第一个判断的依据。第2个判断你在mint之前把他的合约打开一下，然后在asking里面输入合约地址，看一下交易记录，找几个是mint的，打开他的交易记录。把mint那个人的地址抓出来看看，他是不是一个真实玩家。看看别人的mint记录可以简单判断这是不是一个安全合约。\n\n \n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**因为我们本身做代码分析的，所以我们后续会专门针对那个NFT的合约出一个分析的教程或者小工具。直接告诉你，比如说你当前交互的NFT合约，属于哪个标准的，在哪些函数上做了一些改动，或者说这个Mint之后能不能卖，他会不会盗取你多余的授权。我们可能会做一个小工具，让用户能够去非常方便鉴别代码。\n\n \n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**现在这个黑客，他可能把这个私钥也盗了，邮箱也盗了。那这个时候我们还提供了一个召回的功能，就是有点像opensea，你被盗了之后去把这个黑产去打标，那这个过程其实也是跟我们一样，我们进行仲裁了之后会把这个打标，其实是不能解决问题的，一定要防止黑客转赃要防止它二次转移，就是他转到自己钱包，或者说他低价Offer。过程当中我们要防止它二次转移，所以我们要对一次转移的一个行为做一个风控的识别，就是要去识别是不是一个异常行为，我们总结一次转移一般什么情况下是一个异常行为呢？要么就是把一个自己的NFT转到不常用的钱包地址上。第2种，是别人给我一个非常低价的Offer，在opensea上，或者在其他的交易平台上。然后我接受了，这个也是比较异常的。第3个，就是他拿到了我的这个授权，然后转走了。然后我们会去识别异常行为，我们会对你的第二次转移做一个时间的限制，自己可以在平台上设置，他这个反应时间是12个小时还是24个小时。在时间内它都是能够防止黑客去销赃的。做这个事情其是帮助他们即使被盗了，也能防止这个真正发生财产的损失。也能够帮他们直接把NFT召回，就是直接reclaim到他的原来的账户上，或者reclaim到这个项目方的账户上。\n\n \n\n \n\n**话题四：NFT被盗后如何维权？**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**我们当时被盗了之后，就是给这个opensea他们去举报，然后去让他们把这个黑产去打标，但是opensea的仲裁过程其实蛮长的啊，两三天之后我的被盗的才打上标，第2个是你要在社区里面去找一些大佬帮你喊。第3个，你可以用这工具给黑客地址去做一些妥协吧，比如说愿意半价把这个NFT再买回来，这样你可以少损失一半的钱，当然妥协这件事情我是不会做的，大概就是这几种方法吧，所以我们在这个合约创意上也是做了一个就是帮助用户在事后可以去做一些事情的方法。\n\n \n\n**Piaoxue.eth | 胡子观币：**我自己的话没有被盗过，但我身边朋友确实有被盗的。他应该是因为私钥泄露，钱包被盗了，里边有一个月鸟，还有其他的加密货币，总体有100万左右的人民币的一个损失，然后他就去报警了，立案的过程比较艰难，但最后应该是已经立案了，立案之后可以通过数据分析，慢雾啊，他们可以帮他去找这个当时盗他的地址，然后IP，包括交易所的kyc，但是最后好像查到了可能的人，那其中有一些人用的是假kyc，但是报警的确是一个可行的选择。在国内，就比方说你的这个金额超过50万的话，你可以尝试一下去报警，提供一些你的材料。我自己在买猴子的时候，其实买过2个猴子都是被盗的，一个是opensea上买的，我买的时候他没被盗，因为那个时候美国那边就是晚上，等于是半夜被人盗了直接就挂出来，我就买了，买了以后，他还通过推特跟我沟通，说这个是被盗的。然后他说他会去opensea上仲裁。然后后来果然就被opensea给锁了。我觉得这也是需要行业内去讨论怎么解决的问题，下家毕竟也是花了真金白银去买的。我特别认可刚才allen他们要做这个事儿，我理解他们可能是要做一个线上保险柜的这种业务，他可以给我整体账户做一个保障，哪怕说我私钥被盗了，还有可能去他们那里去验证一步，就能很大程度去增加黑客盗你NFT的难度。\n\n** \n **\n\n**话题五：NFT被盗经历分享**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**第一次是被骗的，我mint了杰伦熊，结果卖得比较早，卖光了之后他就飞涨，然后杰伦熊的discord里面有人给我发DM，他说这个只要零点几就能mint了然后赶紧冲，我就赶紧mint了一个，结果就被骗，这个是比较低级的一个。另外一个是点击到一个链接，他直接让钱包做授权。然后这个授权就是把你的所有NFT都拿走了，主要就是这2个经历，然后我就非常生气，就是感觉这个领域的骗子也太嚣张了，然后又觉得我们自己本身就是做安全的，就觉得这也太丢人了。我们几个就去商量怎么去跟他们作对抗打击他们，就慢慢的有了今天的这些想法。这是我自己的一个经历。\n\n \n\n**j.eth：**不小心进了一个骗子网站，mint的剩余数量显示越来越少，就赶紧去mint，mint的时候你会发现他本来上面写的是0.5或者是0.05但是他mint的时候就是把你那个钱包里面所有的以太坊全部转走。我也不知道这个是什么操作，这我是亏最惨的。大家呢不论是玩NFT还是玩币，一定不要fomo，大家不要觉得这个东西买不到了，钱就赚不到了。我在币圈里面总结了一个经验就是这个没有了下一个可能比这个还厉害，就是我的经历。关于NFT被盗，也有很多项目方的自导自演，就是包括很多币被盗，可能都是项目方的自导自演。当然了，我这也没有办法查证，毕竟咱人微言轻啊，身处的国家也不同。关于跨国啊，这个我还真经历过一回，也是一个黑客，把整个农场里面所有的币盗走的一个事儿。当时我在中国，因为我是那个币里边相当大的一个大户，我的钱都放进农场里面去挖矿了，这个黑客也是项目方技术人员之一。然后现在在新加坡，然后这个项目方呢，是美国人在美国啊。大家想一想这个东西有多复杂，想抓也没有那么简单。大家一定要想好的一个问题，千万不要贪小便宜，只要不贪小便宜，别人就骗不着你。而且我一直以来信奉的一个东西，就是一定要拿自己额外的钱进入这个web3或者是玩NFT也好，玩币也好，不要去把自己的身家压上。\n\n \n\n**Piaoxue.eth | 胡子观币：**我的话没有什么被盗经历能分享，我觉得我可以一个受害者的角度跟大家分享一下，就是我买到被盗的之后怎么办的问题，尤其是在opensea上买到的，他后面才标记的这种就挺亏的，我大概比地板价低了5%左右吧，才卖掉的。去Looks上卖的。我觉得这个体验就很不好，买到一个图，结果当天或者第2天他就跟我说我这个是被盗的，然后我也不能把它认证了，所以我觉得这个是受害者视角体验很差，希望粉丝能想一个更好的解决方法，不然的话是对他下面的用户不负责任。很不公平。我是建议，就未来有没有可能就是行业达成某一个协议也好，或者是达成一个新的共识吧。就这个事儿，最后就是一个个人行为，不要牵扯到下家的问题了。\n\n \n\n**JJJ丨AvatarDao：**NFT被盗我没有过，但是我钱包被盗过，有以太坊雪崩链上的币，他给我盗走了，但至今到现在，我也不知道是怎么给我盗的。我链上看了地址，他好多的交易记录都是在coinlist相关，但是我不知道他是怎么给我盗走的，有哪些交集在这些平台上，所以为什么会我们会聚焦在这个地方被这类的人盗走，那可能是我哪儿泄露了比如私钥。我就是总结一些经验，我复制过我的私钥，在微信发过，从我的手机传到我的电脑上，这样复制过，也许会跟这个有关，但是我不确定，就警戒大家这个，从那个之后，我没有再复制过这个私钥了，这种方式一定不要用，它还是有一定的安全隐患。\n\n \n\n**C919.eth：**我是完全赖自己。那个时候不懂，整了个MetaMask钱包也不懂什么助记词不能泄露啊，拿手机截的屏，我后来怀疑我被盗的过程应该是在那个电报群谁发了个什么链接点链接免费领空头时候确认授权了吧，然后丢了几张不值钱的图片，我就这么一个经历，这就是想说新人特别容易被盗，就是什么都不懂时候。现在我防盗的方式是认为以后要长期持有的，我会把它转到一个新钱包，这个钱包只在一个iPhone上，然后这个iPhone什么都不下载，只有一个微信，一个钱包，剩下什么都没有，就当一个硬件钱包用。\n\n \n\n**anling.eth：**我没有过NFT被盗的经验，但是我的钱包被盗了，我了解的一个项目，就潜伏到他们discord想学习他们怎么运营的，就有人给我发私信说他们的那个特别便宜。然后我就点了进去，应该就是连接了他们的网站，在最后一步，我的同事拦住我说这是骗子，但是我那个时候应该我的钱包已经暴露了。但是当时不知道，后来想买一个东西，我就往里面转了钱，转了好几次钱，发现我的钱为什么都消失了我还觉得很奇怪是我打错了，后来发现就被盗了，我的经历就是这样，所以说其实就是对于新人进入这个行业还是要有一定的时间先去学习安全方面的知识，我觉得在我们这个圈子还是比较缺乏的，所以说我们这个项目就很希望去帮助大家提高安全意识，如何去防盗，然后让大家不要这么轻易的就犯这种错误\n\n \n\n**C919.eth：**我感觉如果能在最初期刚接触的时候被盗，他不一定是一件坏事儿，就是你真被盗一次，然后你才真正的有这个经历，这个防范意识。\n\n \n\n**JJJ丨AvatarDao：**我是觉得这个主题在现在我们这个阶段就特别合适。安全方面的一个问题，因为现在这个行情，咱们谈怎么赚钱，其实没什么意思吗？除了2级，即使项目这块也没有什么，但是安全这块就是包括钱包啊，这些都是说在我们币圈一个比较基础的内容，而不是说像比如交易或者是搞项目，哪些人能赚钱，都需要沉淀时间去了解去学习的，像我们趟过这种被骗的雷，你在这个阶段跟交易不同，你是完全可以避开这个雷的，因为它是一些基础知识，你可以直接需要通过，比如我们今天这些嘉宾也好，工具也好，这些介绍都可以了解到，避免被盗，跟大家说一下，真的不是危言耸听，可能大家觉得玩了好久了，我也没被盗，怎么那么容易被盗？当你被盗的时候就是你非常无助，你没有任何办法，盗了你的钱就是没了，希望引起大家重视\n\n \n\n**WaTell：**可能有的时候确实需要一次惨痛经历才能让我们成长，才能让我们讲这个记性。然后我们今天搞这个Space，也是希望通过大家，嘉宾的这些经验，或者说这种惨痛经历能给大家起到一种警示的作用，帮助大家即使不用被实地的骗过一次，也可以获得这种比较强的安全保护意识。\n\n \n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**我们这个NFT项目呢是永不被盗的，所以说如果你在其他地方遭遇过被盗的经历啊，或者说这个钱都丢失的，很无助的这种经历的话，那我觉得可以来看看我们这个项目以及我们做的合约的创新。",

ENS域名一定会成为域名领域的无聊猿》在海内外的广泛传播，而我是中国人，并积极推动给34D赋能，他们猜测我就是那个身家A9的中国富豪。于是，在我和他们讨论合作，想一起为34D赋能时，他们却想通过出卖社区赚取一大笔资金。\n\n以下是260.eth的回复，他们说他们不关心34D支持者们要做什么，如果我们需要社群，他们可以以1000ETH（当时折合价格为280万美元）的价格卖给我们！这可以买超过500个4D！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y1h1EsEWUZmSg4v7eB8XI.png?height=165&width=865)\n\n后来可能自己也认为自己穷疯了，不太好意思，降价到500ETH。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OrWVL_pO5b9eqIbeAc7pw.png?height=80&width=865)\n\n我很佩服他们的眼光，当时10K Club社群不足7000人，他们就看到了社群巨大的价值潜力（如果他们如今已经完成了社区出卖，请社区成员找他索要属于你的那一份，毕竟你也是其中的7000分之一）。同时，我也觉得十分荒诞离奇，原来他们始终都没有想着为34D做一些贡献，而是想着从中收割，谋取不正当的私利。\n\n三个创始人，260.eth,aox.eth，713.eth(现在叫oneill.eth)，我反复和他们进行了沟通。\n\n我认为10K这个概念不错，大家也都是持有者（后来发现，原来只有我们是持有者，而他们已经卖出了自己手中大部分的34D，非常讽刺），能够发挥自己所长，一起做好一件事就完美了。但没想到这些人格局这么差，提出了上述令人作呕的方案。\n\n后来其他10K Builder就建议我单独建立一个社区。而我当时仍然一直认为我们都应该为34D赋能，没必要再去建一个社区，从而导致社区分裂，一起将10K Club做好就很好了。为此我还想了折中方案，并给他们都一一发送了消息，近乎低三下四地去和他们沟通。\n\n260\\.eth直接不再回复。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LhLww1MsyCshus_DpO46P.png?height=345&width=865)\n\n以下是aox.eth回复（是的，我得到了fucked）,并拉黑了我。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SJCbICXlSVSWEJ9yDeQjN.png?height=813&width=633)\n\n713\\.eth还直接教我怎么割韭菜了，显然深谙其中道理，呵呵。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyGW0bFNYWHnoouQKfypM.png?height=746&width=607)\n\n这是我对他的回复\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SyzjolmaAyzqVOjzzpuhY.png?height=422&width=626)\n\n最终我和很多社区成员也非常无奈，只能选择逐渐再建立一个社区。但是，当时我认为34D在发展早期，没有必要把他们这些丑陋行径说出来，导致社区分裂（我现在才知道我的善良带来了多大的失误，使得他们继续从中谋取不正当利益，给社区成员造成了巨大的损失）。\n\n**行径二：打压其他34D建设者**\n\n在技术团队的没日没夜工作下，比特币披萨节当天，俱乐部网站10kmap.io正式上线。同时我们成立了10K Universe的DC社群。由社区成员志愿捐献，我们拿出了5个4D域名以及7.5ETH开展活动，鼓励大家熟悉ENS的操作。第一轮活动中，我们的宣传口号是“价值500ETH的4D域名赠送”的原因，其一是认为未来4D价格也许能像无聊猿一样，涨到100E的水平，另外也是嘲讽10K Club DC创始人想以500ETH价格将 DC社区成员出卖这件事。\n\n之后，我们也会去10K CLUB 的DC群发一些动态，让大家关注项目发展，鼓励大家参与活动，也能获得一些福利。但是，当他们发现10K Universe热度起来了，有34D持有者逐渐加入了10K Universe，这可能不利于他们将来割韭菜了，哈哈。\n\n然后他们可能就找了一个10K CLUB管理员，3070.eth，在10K Club社群内公开污蔑10K Universe花钱买机器人粉丝之类，并拿出了所谓的“证据”。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GvSLUPyu-FHwcIIU5teLn.png?height=154&width=865)\n\n我对他进行了反驳，以上是我给他的解释。那段时间社区成员仅增长了几百人，而且是因为有中国的KOL帮我们进行了宣传。因为10K Universe社区志愿者Hanz之前参与管理过的社群曾遭受过机器人攻击，他担心有机器人加入社群，甚至手动封禁了100多个账户（那时候整个社群人数才1000多人），反而因此误封了很多真实用户。\n\n所以我想让3070.eth拿出他的证据来源，看是不是存在机器人。于是，我私聊了他，而他至今都没有回复，但却直接在10K CLUB将我禁言了7天！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NOIjr9Ediwa3isTH1TQ6m.png?height=527&width=865)\n\n这些人的行为实在让我伤心透了。从此之后，我就再也没去10K Club的DC群说过一句话。\n\n**行径三：违背社区投票结果，抢先注册一些域名，并通过宣传，意图高价卖给社区成员**\n\n虽然他们的举动让我受了一些委屈，但本来想着也没必要说出这些事情，占用公共资源。而且，之前关注到他们的账户，他们基本也把自己手里的34D都卖光了，想必该消停点了。没想到最近34D的价格刚有点起色，他们又开始动歪心思了，悄悄注册了某些品类的域名。然后，以260.eth为首，在推特更换带有阿拉伯头巾的头像，修改自己的推特名字，并鼓励不知情的其他用户也进行修改，通过鼓吹阿拉伯语数字域名和炒作中文数字域名等，意图进一步地割韭菜。炒作阿拉伯语数字域名和中文数字域名，难道不是因为他们认为阿拉伯人和中国人人傻钱多？\n\n要知道，曾经10K Club社群还发起过投票，删除了所有非34D域名的其他频道！而他们和少数人居然为了自己的利益，违背社区的投票结果，公开宣传34D以外的域名，从而高价卖给被蒙骗的用户！\n\n删除其他频道的提案和目的\n\n[https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e](https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e)\n\n260\\.eth更换了戴有阿拉伯头巾的头像，并更改了推特名字\n\n我想知道他是否清楚阿拉伯头巾的正确佩戴方法及含义。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjN7CjsNnhG1OcGmSYR5-.png?height=636&width=865)\n\n在推特频繁宣传阿拉伯语数字域名。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RAvL6nsHZ0ZRy4Fwju-xu.png?height=1285&width=865)\n\n最近又转向对其他域名的宣传\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/exUZK-8QY9FvfO5brxg13.png?height=655&width=865)\n\n我想人们一旦购买了它，他们钱包中的资金将会减少。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xYKk08zTeN_vQM3tcSMPi.png?height=1201&width=865)\n\n于此同时，他却提前注册，并试图高价出售这些他非常看好的域名。既然如此坚定看好，为什么你却以如此低的价格出售？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZIAf8PHcAUojOJpjkhY1_.png?height=265&width=865)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kVbRaGQI6Ti3eHqhGXa1_.png?height=439&width=865)\n\n同时他仍在不断注册新的域名\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7kTKm1WLG6DAp5d5RuErv.png?height=495&width=865)\n\n请注意，这还只是他的公开账号。当你看到一只蟑螂在地板上乱窜时，很可能还有很多只蟑螂藏在冰箱后面或者水槽下面。\n\n他们这些行为让我感到不舒服。因此，我决定将这背后的故事讲出来，交给社区去评判。希望社区成员能够擦亮眼睛，保持理智，不要被少数人蒙骗，进而损失资金。也希望34D持有者不要因为个别人的行径，就对34D丧失信心，作为未来的Web3身份中的蓝筹，它的未来价值也不会受到个别社群成员不良行为的影响。而我们依然有着强大的10K Universe社区，将会为34D不断增加新的有趣又有价值的场景。\n\n我始终认为，君子爱财，取之有道，在此也正告260.eth等人，不要再做一些通过伤害社区利益而谋取个人私利的事情了！\n\n目前，仍有很多10K Builder在不断为34D宣传和增加价值，请保持信心和关注。\n\n我们的建设者有（排名无先后顺序，以下名单并不完整，希望大家补充，也希望大家参与进来）\n\n5660\\.eth; 550.eth; 8249.eth; 8975.eth；139.eth；366.eth；5552.eth；0377.eth；5666.eth；789.eth；2789.eth；5655.eth；2111.eth",

"​主编：东入海\n\n副编：大耳兄\n\n\\#桌上有酒，心里有火\n\n***导读：我们感觉行业变化很快，信息总是滞后，运营方面没有好的文章沉淀下来。所以我们选择去做这个事，发掘价值项目，触达核心团队，总结Web3运营玩法，带给焰火的朋友们！***\n\n本期焰火酒馆请来了JediSwap创始人Rohit Goyal，他分享了进入Web3之前的经历，聊了聊Web3社区、用户、产品、DAO、熊市以及其他。以下，Enjoy：\n\n![致力于链接与合作的一个从业者社区](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e99cqkauLn4wRQOS0Egcc.jpg?height=1500&width=2000)\n\n**1、 Hi,Rohit，欢迎做客焰火酒馆，可以讲讲你自己嘛？你是如何跳进Web3兔子洞的？在那之前你在做什么？**\n\n在过去的十二年内，我在Web 2是一位连续创业者。曾经是一家电子商务公司的创始人,2010年之后创立了一家移动游戏公司Paxplay,通过社交游戏来拉近玩家之间的距离。***正当我在为这款游戏的增长而忙碌的时候，朋友向我介绍了比特币，在看完白皮书后我感到欣喜和震惊，仿佛打开了另一个世界的大门。我意识到这不仅仅是单纯的金融系统创新，更给人类如何相互链接和高效协作提供了思路。***\n\n2016年运营游戏公司的时候我同样意识到了一些中心化带来的问题，之后更加花大量的时间学习和了解Web3，研究以太坊的白皮书和其他Web3项目的白皮书。\n\n\\*2017年末,我开始了自己的第一次加密冒险，创立了Mudrex.com(https://twitter.com/officialmudrex)，总部位于班加罗尔，早期由 Y Combinator支持，已在Pre-A轮从Arkam Ventures、Tribe Capital等机构筹集650万美元。\\*模式很简单，许多人通过投资来开启他们自己的Web3旅程，而加密世界仍然是很技术流派，很复杂，对于很多人来说还很难以理解，所以我的项目就是帮他们的投资变得更简单。现如今Mudrex.com已经拥有超过50万人的用户。\n\n2020Defi 的革新让我重新思考，严格意义上来说mudrex.com还是Web2的公司。我想要更进一步，真正跳进Web3，随后我跟伙伴们成立了Mesh Finance 。建立团队需要大量技术人员，并且运营成本也会很贵，我们先组了社区，再从社区里面挑选和组建团队。\n\n在了解完以太坊，Polygon，Arbitrum以及其他的链后，我们觉得ZK Rollup 会是杀手级的技术，能在上面开发一些不可思议的东西。**那时我们注意到在Starknet上开发的团队很少， 还没有人在开发AMM，所以我们决定来做这件事，这就是JediSwap的由来。**\n\n![JediSwap社区创作](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kLfBmj9O18B2IJKULAO-v.png?height=674&width=865)\n\n**​2、在你看来社区是什么？**\n\n在我看来，不同背景的人因为同样的愿景和想象而相聚，社区(特指Discord)更像是人和工具聚合后的一个综合体。***社区有多强大，取决于人们的共同愿景有多强，共识有多强。***\n\n**3、如何去设计、运营它呢？**\n\n我们是社区发起人员，想要将Web3 展示给世界，我们相信去中心化系统、坚信每个人都享有平等进入加密世界的权利。如果你也认可我们的文化和价值观，那你便可成为社区的一员。所以当新的伙伴加入之后，大家便是同一条战线上的盟军。我们需要各自找到在团队中的位置，完成将Web3带入这个世界的任务。\n\n想象一下你将要去参加一个派对, 进入房间后发现里面许多陌生人，孤身一人的你会感到无所适从。所以社区经理的责任就是让新人来到社区之后感到宾至如归，了解他们的背景信息，在加密世界的经历以及对加密世界的看法。发现新人擅长和熟悉的领域后，试探性地问他们是否有想成为贡献者的打算。\n\n如何去定义一名贡献者？任何在JediSwap奉献过心力、时间、点子的人都会是贡献者，任何建设JediSwap的人都是贡献者。\n\n**4、我们看到JediSwap社区内活跃有序、务实强大，包括你们在和社区共建产品。背景不同的成员都会自发参与到建设当中。你们是怎么做到的？**\n\n社区内会分成不同的小组，包括研究小组，设计小组，内容小组，问题解决小组。研究小组会研究不同项目之间的差异，获取那些带给我们灵感的设计。设计小组会设计海报、视频和供社区成员使用的表情和贴纸(Sticker）， 我们推特用的海报和视频都是出自于贡献者的手中。内容板块主要由内容小组负责，他们承担了我们大部分的内容工作。此外我们还有专门的问题解决小组,项目进展过程中出现的问题可以丢到小组里，擅长解决该问题的贡献者会进行头脑风暴并给出相应方案。\n\n每个小组都会有一个Leader，比如说我是问题解决小组的Leader ， 我会去详细调研进入我小组的人，做好备案，心中有数。活来了就派发给不同的人，使大家各司其职。\n\n比如有人对DAO运营很有经验，那关于DAO的问题就可以具体咨询他们的意见。***贡献者能力越大，承担的责任越大，他们投入的心血社区成员有目共睹，社区对贡献者的信任和绑定也就会加深。同时他们也激励着更多新人投入到社区中，他们作为贡献者在积分系统中的等级会随着工作量证明而变高。***\n\n![JediSwap社区创作](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tfFzJOQD9L4Q2v6cV7z_u.png?height=708&width=865)\n\n**5、为了使整个社区更加团结一致，JediSwap还做了什么？**\n\n我们明确了运营的理念和逻辑，设置了很高的社区标准。举个简单的例子，我们还没有过要靠补贴或者抽奖的方式来促活拉新的经历 , 我们从没有提前承诺过任何回报, 成员需要真刀真枪地以自己的方式为社区做出贡献。一旦人们付出了他们的时间，他们就真正地参与到项目里面来了，在心智与情感上和社区做了绑定。在这种理念的指引下，我们做了更多机制上的设计，它们会为我们的社区带来如何的变化呢？***如今社区每个贡献者都需要把他做的所有事上传到公共区域（Public Domain） ,这意味着成员所做贡献值更透明，这是我们遵循的准则。***\n\n制订一个公平透明、开放灵活的工作证明系统 ，坚决地执行非常重要。如此一来，新成员会觉得这个社区真的有一套公平的系统，也就会奉献出全部的力气和才华。\n\n在这种情况下，就不再是你一个人想要让社区变得强大，而是你设计的机制驱使整个社区团结一致。\n\n**6.你怎么理解用户、社区、产品之间的关系以及如何去做增长？**\n\n用户和社区这两个的定义有所不同，许多项目方将两者混为一谈。我认为，用户是使用产品的一群人。拿我们自己举例，mesh finance 社区的产品是JediSwap, JediSwap 社区的产品是 AMM protocol 。但社区成员并不全是我们的用户，用户也不一定就全部进入了社区。\n\n并且，市场营销和社区运营准确来说不是一回事。\n\n我们前期在市场营销vs产品及社区打造两者之间做了取舍，选择将更多的精力投入到产品迭代和社区建设上，同时持续倾听大家的心声，收集大家的反馈。***打造一个高品质的社区始终是我们的追求，产品和社区建设是我们的“道”，市场营销是“术”，我们尽量专注于“道”的建设，而非舍本逐末。***\n\n![JediSwap社区创作](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nDbvrVBNUVunKutbILGJj.png?height=291&width=865)\n\n**7.讲讲你对DAO当下和未来的看法？**\n\n对于我来说,DAO是web3 催生出来的最激动人心的实验,也会是未来的工作方式。为什么我会有这种感受？\n\n现如今公司的形态让99%的人工作方式一成不变，他们担任着几乎不变的岗位职责，每天8-10个小时的工作时间，日复一日。你会喜欢这种工作方式嘛？ 如果你问一下身边的朋友，可能大部分都会说不喜欢。\n\n对大部分人来说，工作的目的就是去赚一些钱，养家糊口。在这个过程中你不会感受到工作带来的快乐。​\n\n相反，回顾一下你的大学生涯，你可以为了一个创意、灵感乐此不疲的跟同学探讨、碰撞想法，这是一种享受，跟打工人的心态完全不同。DAO也是如此，你在一个社区内贡献自己的力量，跟一群与你有着同样的理想和志向、同样的目标的人成长交流，这种经历会让你回想起大学那种激情燃烧的岁月。\n\n再者，一成不变的工作会让人的创造性慢慢消亡，而DAO 会让工作变得更加有趣，创造性和人的潜力得到充分发挥。想象一下你可以同时在三个不同的地方工作，每天接触不同的挑战。这会让你的不同技能获得锻炼提升，你的技能变得更加值钱。\n\n***为DAO工作意味着职业生涯不会被一份工作、一个老板、一家公司买断。人们总会找到感兴趣的DAO，从而不必担心会被辞退。当人们为DAO工作后，便很难再适应现在的工作方式。你也可以看到现在越来越多的人加入了DAO的行列***\n\n**8、目前熊市漫漫，你有什么想对Web3的创业者说的嘛？**\n\n毫无疑问，现在市场情绪很低迷，但我认为真正的Builder和创业者不会太在乎牛熊。从Web3整个行业来讲，我们依旧在很早期。***如果拿Web2的发展阶段与Web3 做比较的话，恐怕亚马逊那样的大公司还没有出现。***\n\n所以不要去过度担心熊市或者牛市，任何时候都是建设的好时候，包括现在。熊市中外界的噪音会更少，项目方可以更加专注项目本身，同时这对投资者来说也是学习的好时机，可以更好地筛选出真正优质具备反脆弱性的好项目。***如果回顾历史你就会发现，伟大的产品经过熊市的洗礼会变得愈发强大。***\n\n![JediSwap社区创作](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OhTi0eA9BE4wrwTJMVHJH.png?height=450&width=865)\n\n**9、你还有什么想对焰火酒馆的朋友们说的嘛？**\n\nJediSwap 是一个由社区组成并驱动的经济系统 ，每位社区成员在这里相遇并互相学习。我们想要构建Defi 市场上最棒的AMM（自动做市商），想要与最棒的社区经理和贡献者一起工作，给大家带来一个友好的社区。欢迎每一个对JediSwap感兴趣的人，***对DAO或DEFI感兴趣的人，无论专业知识和背景，只要你愿意，JediSwap的社区就是我们一起学习和Build的地方，加入我们吧，你的出色工作会被社区发现并获得回报。***\n\n![Gitcoin捐款情况](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oMUanNFQc2VJq95RJmRlf.png?height=773&width=865)\n\n**在Gitcoin

This produced a multitude of societal harms, such as [behavior manipulation, concealed influence, preference falsification, political polarization, and real-world violence](https://ana.mirror.xyz/XhSTOgQvG9gBMGsyPgnGnUqvCGysrQBf2pz-KGDev9U). The situation is exacerbated by weak privacy protections for user data: frameworks that are at once overly prescriptive and insufficiently adaptive to encompass the shifting privacy boundaries of users in their digital contexts.\n\nThe emergence of distributed ledgers known as blockchains – where data is public by default and design – greatly increases the attack surface for digital privacy infringement. Its protection, meanwhile, remains largely unaddressed because both privacy governance and identity management fall outside the custody of the users whose experience of privacy is most affected.\n\nProtecting consumers against manipulation and surveillance capitalism, particularly in emergent environments such the metaverse, requires rearchitecting privacy and identity management to adaptively safeguard user agency and autonomy in context. \n\nThis paper examines how conceptions of privacy have evolved over time and offers recommendations that include self-sovereign identity management as well as steps to ensure that users’ privacy experiences and consent preferences provide confidentiality, interoperability, and agency. The paper concludes with a call to action to the engineering and technical community involved in building blockchain technologies to urgently address the primitives that lead to surveillance capitalism – absence of user-centric identity management and overexposure of user telemetry – in order to avoid recreating surveillance capitalism on the blockchain and in emerging digital environments.\n\n## Introduction \n\nPolicy and governance have historically lagged the privacy encroachments of advertising-supported technology platforms such as Facebook (now Meta), Google, and Twitter. These companies compete for attention and engagement to generate revenue, devising intentionally addictive user experiences and adversarial product interfaces designed to maximize user information capture. This **data exhaust**, or the trail of personal telemetry left behind by Internet users with little insight into or agency over their digital footprints, is then sold to advertisers, malicious actors, and anyone willing to pay for the datasets, giving rise to the pernicious business of surveillance capitalism.\n\nData exhaust is valuable to marketers and information operatives because it powers behavior models used to predict and manipulate outcomes. These outcomes can be as innocuous as influencing a purchase, or something much more alarming, such as polarizing an electorate and swaying a vote.\n\nThere is growing acknowledgement among lawmakers, policy experts, technologists, and consumers alike that platforms that feed on user telemetry are correlated with and often causally linked to political polarization, online toxicity, isolation and depression, and distrust in democratic institutions (Harris, 2019). The balkanization of public consensus resulting from behavior manipulation and targeted narrative warfare spills over into real world violence (Smith, 2021) and has, according to former National Security Advisor Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, become a serious national security threat (Harris & Raskin, 2022).\n\nRegulations have failed to stem the tide of data exhaust that powers surveillance capitalism. This is in part due to the pacing problem: innovation moves faster than its effects can be felt and described with sufficient precision to devise mitigation strategies – and by that time, the harm is already done (Thierer 2020). Even then, regulatory remedies only address symptoms, not underlying causes, so harms perpetuate in forms not captured in the new law. Ambiguity about what exactly privacy is and how much privacy citizens should enjoy further complicates the task of devising solutions for a problem that resists definition (Cohen, 2012).\n\nAlthough pacing problems and definitional ambiguities do not serve society well, they are not the crux of the issue. The root cause of surveillance capitalism is a failure to build the Internet with a persistent, portable, and composable identity layer that allows users to self-custody their privacy decisions and self-govern how they connect, to what services, and under which conditions. The best available proxy for digital identity became the email address – and later, the social media account – which associated users to a data store of attributes and interactions owned and operated by technology companies – such as Google and Meta – provisioning those accounts to users.\n\nSince this model of identity management separated users from custody over their data, privacy governance has focused on how companies should handle their users’ data, and not what users should be able to do with their own data. But privacy is a continuum of people’s ever-shifting boundaries and preferences that ebb and flow according to situation, environment, time, and mood. These characteristics defy the prescriptive, uniform definitions promulgated by centrally managed regulatory frameworks and legal remedies. Contexts shift while frameworks remain static, leaving user privacy boundaries vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal laid bare the need for better protections against surveillance capitalism – not only for the information security of the sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) that platforms manage, but for the autonomous agency and cognition of the person described by that PII. To reimagine privacy governance from first principles, we must rearchitect how we issue, manage, and govern digital identity — and place users in the center.\n\nWith the rise of public blockchains, this challenge is now even more pressing. Smart contract signatures and financial transactions are immutably stored on public ledgers for anyone, including advertisers, data brokers, and malicious actors, to track, analyze, and model, exacerbating the data exhaust problem that powers surveillance capitalism on platform businesses. \n\nInternet users require robust protections across the full landscape of digital experiences, a daunting and infinitely complex undertaking that centrally managed governance has provably failed. Unless we give users full custody of their identities – and therefore their data, privacy preferences, and access controls – we will not only replicate but multiply the same problems that gave us Cambridge Analytica in the nascent blockchain, cryptocurrency, and metaverse technologies collectively referred to as Web3.\n\n## Privacy’s Uncertain Value\n\nUntil philosopher Helen Nissenbaum described privacy as a contextual spectrum determined by situated informational norms (2010), most experts and lawmakers had sought to articulate a precise universal definition – and to locate its value outside the individual’s subjective experience. A monolithic description, or at least a quantifiable evaluation of the purpose it serves in society, was deemed necessary for devising governance. But while laws require precise signifiers and calculable consequences, people’s privacy boundaries are variable and idiosyncratic, so any singular definition will necessarily remain simplistic, vague, and incomplete.\n\nSamuel Warren and Louis Brandeis offered perhaps the first contribution to legal scholarship on privacy. Their *Harvard Law Review* polemic against the intrusions of the media, which reported on a private wedding ceremony without permission (reporting made possible, ironically, by the “disruptive” technology of the day: the invention of photo cameras) influenced over a century of privacy jurisprudence (1980). They argued that just as “a man’s house is his castle,” the private facts, thoughts, and emotions that constitute “inviolate personality” should likewise be shielded from public view. Their impassioned plea foreshadowed modern-day concerns about the impact of disruptive technologies on private life. It also laid the groundwork for the subsequent establishment of privacy torts that enumerate four specific harms: intrusion upon seclusion, public disclosure of private facts, false light, and appropriation of name or likeness (Prosser, 1960).\n\nAttempts to define the legal boundaries of inherently subjective experience have largely proven too rigid and limiting to be practicable; this is especially true for digital experiences. Scholars have sought to broaden the scope beyond the narrow definitions of intrusive injuries and torts by connecting the *presence* of privacy to positive ideals of self-expression, actualization, and “free moral and cultural play” (Cohen, 2012), autonomous agency and sound decision-making (Burkert, 1998), and the conditions necessary for the developmental formation (Rosen & Santesso, 2011). Ethicist Shanon Vallor, for example, argues that “digital media mechanisms \\[that\\] undermine our self-control, cognitive autonomy, and moral agency” make it “harder, not easier, for us to choose well” (2016). This freedom to soundly evaluate options and make agentic, self-sovereign choices is, according to political scientist Priscilla Regan, a public good critical “to the flourishing of liberal societies” (Nissenbaum, 2010).\n\nScholars have also defined privacy by the inverse: that the *absence* of privacy causes material societal harms. Daniel Solove writes that people need privacy not to conceal illicit activity, but to avert social disciplining effects, without which their choices fall subject to decisional interference (2007). Because they generally fear the disapproval of their peers, individuals in surveilled spaces self-censor, falsify their preferences, and communicate ideas that differ from their true perspectives, generating a distorted view of reality. The accumulated misrepresentations of people’s real thoughts and sentiments achieves increasingly genuine social acceptance and normalization over time, leading to what philosopher Jeffrey Reiman calls psychopolitical metamorphosis (Nissenbaum, 2010). \n\nBy placing our survival needs for social approbation above our developmental needs for individual agency, surveilled spaces invite confirmation bias and groupthink. Individuals become more susceptible to social pressure and propaganda, especially if shared by those they wish to emulate or impress. Thus, even if people have nothing whatsoever to hide, surveillance materially alters perceived social norms and expressed behaviors.\n\n## The Failure of Identity Management and Informed Consent\n\nWhile there is widespread agreement that privacy shares a causal link with autonomy and self-determination, its subjective and context-dependent nature does not lend itself to quantification or uniform governance. Yet it is precisely this nebulous space of shifting norms and expectations that privacy management must somehow locate and defend without collapsing the context and nuance necessary for rigorous, agentic governance.\n\nThe individual in question has the most granular just-in-time context necessary to formulate an appropriate defensive response, so, logically, privacy governance should reside within the individual’s purview. But absent the requisite identity layer to make such self-custody possible, digital identity shifted to the next available proxy: email addresses and social logins. Management of those digital identities likewise shifted to the custodians of those proxies: the technology companies issuing email and social login credentials. This awkward workaround for user-centric identity necessitated prescriptive and deterministic regulatory governance that, predictably, has failed to maintain the contextual integrity of users’ privacy boundaries, while leaving companies to amass vast stores of user telemetry and PII for exploitation by hackers, third parties, and the platforms themselves.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Privacy Framework (NIST), for example, set out to “build customer trust” by “future-proofing products and services” (2020). It proposed to do this essentially by predicting the future: defining information inventory strategies and data processing policies, subdividing data types and users into categories, and prescribing response and communication protocols across the entire surface area of consumer-facing technology. That this framework was built to help companies comply with requirements rather than to help users preserve their cognitive autonomy is the first clue to why its relevance and applicability are limited. \n\nMore importantly, it is not difficult to imagine how attempts to “future-proof” technology by hoping to anticipate all emergent data types and interaction flows a user in some hypothetical future product might face creates system design contradictions for software architects and unintended complications for users. The practice of writing long and inscrutable Terms of Service (TOS) and End-User License Agreements (EULA) is the direct result of the tension between compliance requirements and irreconcilable design contradictions. Since companies cannot anticipate every possible context that a user might face any more so than a governance framework can, they settled on a workaround. By notifying users and obtaining their consent to relinquish data and decision rights in exchange for service, companies got off the hook for safeguarding contextual integrity while passing the burden of privacy management off to users without giving them the tools to manage their boundaries.\n\nOf course, companies have no expectation that users will actually read, understand, or make rational and agentic choices about EULAs or TOS due to impracticable time and expertise barriers (Kröger et al, 2021). This purely performative practice has nonetheless become a widespread convenient fiction that neutralizes public concerns and allows companies to satisfy compliance without meaningfully protecting privacy. As a result, companies have been incentivized to treat privacy as a legal condition to be met while ignoring the *intent* of privacy management: to preserve the moral autonomy, cognitive consent, and contextual integrity of individuals whose unprotected digital telemetry leaves them vulnerable to surveillance and concealed influence. \n\nCentralized, one-size-fits-all, exogenous technical frameworks separate users from agency over their digital identities and data. They promulgate a deterministic conception of privacy that holds constant across all contexts, settings, environments, and technological futures.\n\nRealistic privacy governance would offer individuals latitude to modulate how much privacy they desire and when, and to respond in context to their shifting privacy boundaries. More privacy is not always preferable, nor is it always possible. Users might, for example, wish to simplify the labyrinthine process of collecting and transferring patient histories by lowering their privacy settings to expediently share records between medical offices. On the other hand, users would almost certainly want more privacy for their Amazon purchasing history or before placing a large bid on a non-fungible token (NFT).\n\nSince the only party with sufficiently rich information to make an agentic, context-informed choice is the individual in question, responsive privacy governance must center end users, not companies.\n\n## The Urgency of Rearchitecting Digital Identity\n\nNearly every issue in privacy governance stems from the same origin: the absence of self-owned, user-centric identity and access controls. We evolved effective identifiers for websites and endpoints, but not for the people using them.\n\nFor users to interact with websites, companies began issuing local accounts with usernames and passwords. This **siloed** approach to digital identity meant that users had to create unique accounts for every site, leading to a poor user experience and creating massive breach liabilities for companies whose only interest was to grant users access, not to manage their accounts and PII. The prospect of getting out of the business of storing sensitive data and having to manage expensive cybersecurity regimes to fend off hackers became attractive to companies, who were happy to outsource the entire thing to bigger players with more ambitious plans for PII.\n\nThis gave rise to **federated** identity, an opportunity to both streamline fragmented user experiences across identity silos and monetize vast quantities of user telemetry for secondary use. Providers such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon entered the identity space to become the “trusted” middlemen of digital identity credentials, offering users a way log in with their pre-existing accounts, while shifting the responsibility for information security from individual businesses to federations equipped with the vast resources of technology platforms.\n\nImportantly, this centralization of identity into federations abstracted interaction and identity decisions away from users and their context. Users ended up with “tens or hundreds of fragments of themselves scattered across different organizations, with no ability to control, update or secure them effectively” (Tobin, 2016), perfecting the conditions for surveillance capitalism.\n\nIf the goal is to return agency, moral autonomy, and cognitive consent to digital users, then users need the tools to modulate their own access controls and preferences across infinite contexts. An exhaustively descriptive and infinitely flexible expression of all possible choices across all systems and futures is impossible only if one considers building it in a centralized way, where governance takes place exogenously, outside the locus of the user, through universal practices and compliance requirements imposed from outside. \n\nBut people want different things. Exogenous, centralized privacy management cannot possibly give people the precise level of privacy they want because that is tantamount to predicting the future. The only parties capable of formulating just-in-time responses to infinite environments, attributes, transmission principles, and contexts – and modulating how much signal they emit in response – are end users themselves.\n\n**Self-sovereign identity** (SSI) is an approach to identity management that empowers users to self-custody their own identities, data, and privacy decisions. SSI can eliminate centralized middlemen and the overexposure of PII to federations by appending encrypted identity attributes to a user’s public key, which only the user or a designated third party can access. The flow of information between parties happens only with the cryptographic consent of the identity owner whose credentials are requested. In its ideal state, SSI allows users to “log in” to any product, service, game, metaverse, or protocol – irrespective of the user’s chosen SSI tool or wallet – and to transact while minimizing data exchange.\n\nSignificant obstacles stand in the way of ecosystem-wide adoption of SSI. In order for an identity to be useful, trusted identity providers must agree to issue their credentials to the user’s identity or namespace, and verifying parties must be satisfied that the levels of assurance followed by issuers satisfy security criteria. But for identity providers to undertake the effort to develop credentials, the credentials themselves must first be accepted by enough verifying parties, or their usecase becomes too narrow to pursue. In turn, for credentials to see wide adoption, enough issuers must first agree to develop and issue them.\n\nThis cold-start problem in SSI requires urgent resolution, because absent user-centric identity management, the problems of federated identity will compound in Web3. Indeed, Web3 has already encountered familiar privacy intrusion problems. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), for example, struggle with preference falsification in governance proposals. Since votes are stored on-chain and visible to others, DAO members self-discipline their preferences to abide by the group’s prevailing norms. In decentralized finance (DeFi), bad actors can manipulate outcomes in what is called a sandwich attack. Since all participants can see the price of any trade, attackers scan protocols for pending transactions. They then issue two orders: one just before the transaction and one right after, artificially increasing the price of the trade to generate profits. Finally, in online gaming, users find themselves in increasingly immersive environments where their behaviors – from how long they stare at an object to which users they interact with – become inputs for predictive modeling. The surface area for manipulation in the metaverse increases by orders of magnitude from what users face today on social networks because augmented and virtual reality interfaces produce richer, more descriptive telemetry, including biometric markers.\n\nBecause Web3 alters the fundamentals about how people transact value and construct meaning, many observers ascribe to it all manner of unrealistic hopes, including the naive idea that users will own their data simply by exiting extractive platforms that monetize attention. In fact, Web3 does nothing to end surveillance capitalism because the primitives that drive surveillance capitalism – missing identity layer, unchecked data exhaust – are left unaddressed. Even if we do away with centralized platforms altogether and shift all business to decentralized protocols, the only thing that changes is where user telemetry gets stored: in the cloud or on the public ledger. Indeed, the privacy implications of Web3 are made worse, not better, because even if platforms no longer own user data, all their transactions become a matter of public record, exposing users to targeted monitoring and surveillance by anyone who wishes to perform a rudimentary Etherscan or Chainanalysis search.\n\n## Reimagining Privacy and Identity Management\n\nSSI provides an essential component for architecting a coherent privacy framework that places the locus of control within the user’s purview. A working SSI ecosystem would furthermore have three key attributes: confidentiality, interoperability, and agency.\n\n### Confidentiality\n\nTo end surveillance capitalism, technology must stem the flow of unprotected, widely available data exhaust. While SSI allows users to reduce their aggregate digital footprint, it provides zero confidentiality for signal emitted once a smart contract is signed or a transaction appended to a blockchain. Those signals leave a traceable, publicly viewable trail of remittances, holdings, purchases, votes, and interactions enabling precise reconstruction of identity to model behavior and manipulate outcomes.\n\nTo mitigate the accumulation of so much sensitive telemetry on public ledgers, a privacy-preserving decentralized identity ecosystem would need to provide confidentiality by obscuring the details of smart contract signatures and blockchain transactions, or by altogether breaking the link between interconnected public keys. There is a need for research, development, and investment into encryption techniques such as, for example, zero-knowledge proof cryptography, which allows a party to prove that a statement is true without furnishing proof of the statement itself. By taking advantage of selective disclosure and least privilege access, SSI can help users reduce their data exhaust, making surveillance more time-intensive and less lucrative to pursue.\n\n### Interoperability\n\nInteroperable acceptance is a precondition for ecosystem-wide adoption of SSI, which requires that all companies, applications, protocols, and platforms agree to use a common set of data rails and not lock users into their own proprietary ways of handling data. A familiar way to think about interoperability is having all email providers using the same Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), without which users could not communicate between servers. To that end, the Worldwide Web Consortium, an international standards body led by web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, has released a set of common standards for decentralized identifiers (DiD) and verifiable credentials (VC) that the entire ecosystem can use to interoperate (Worldwide Web Consortium, 2021). \n\nInteroperability is critical because it not only eliminates silos but alleviates the information overload and unrealistic time and expertise requirements that arise when users are asked to consent to TOS and EULAs  (or, in the case of blockchains, to “do their own research” by reading smart contract code, a popular and cynical version of the notice-and-consent paradigm that is emerging in Web3). Users cannot and will not read technical agreements; nor will they ever become privacy experts – and not because they are lazy but because the idea itself is impractical. This is a design constraint that technologists must stop ignoring, minimizing, and sidestepping.\n\nFor SSI to provide value, users would need ways to “set and forget” default preferences across categories of similar transactions and experiences without getting bogged down in code and contracts – while also protecting these preference groupings against exploitation by malicious code. Digital products and services would, by extension, be obligated to read and abide by these default preferences, adjusting the experience they provide accordingly instead of expecting users to lower their privacy boundaries. Unless the entire SSI ecosystem operates on the same, standardized data rails, SSI will not be an improvement over the consent theater of federated identity that it replaces. \n\n### Agency\n\nFinally, for users to become the ultimate arbiters of their online lives, they must be able to modulate their privacy boundaries entirely at their discretion, requiring a rich menu of controls to adapt their privacy preferences in response to shifting norms and surrounding context. This calls for clear, easily navigable user interfaces that present transparent controls for privacy options. Since very little interaction design research has been conducted on SSI interfaces and identity wallets, this is an area of Web3 that is ripe for innovation and invention.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis paper aims to stimulate discourse among the engineers, founders, and visionaries building Web3 about the urgency of rethinking privacy and identity management. Deterministic, exogenous privacy frameworks not only limit the possibility space for invention, but quickly fall out of relevance as system designers devise creative workarounds that most often take the form of high-friction user experiences. This is especially true of Web3, a space that is experiencing rapid innovation with consequences that fall outside the scope of existing governance.\n\nThere is a fatal flaw in the naive logic that blockchain technologies will, on their own, address the harms that pervade our dominant platforms: most of those harms are rooted in ineffective privacy protections and poorly designed identity management, not extractive business models. The promise of a new business model does not by itself address the underlying primitives that create surveillance capitalism: data exhaust, behavior tracking and aggregation, and digital identities abstracted from their true owners. The business model of attention-driven economics is merely a symptom of surveillance capitalism, not its source. So long as the surplus telemetry that emerges from ineffective and outdated privacy frameworks and identity governance enables the monetization of data exhaust for commercial gain, surveillance capitalism will persist. \n\nUnless we address these failure modes by architecting a confidential, interoperable, and agentic self-sovereign identity ecosystem, there will be no material difference between extractive platform businesses and the decentralized versions that hope to supplant them. Systematic commercialization of attention will merely shift from platforms to protocols, yielding the same predations we have grown weary of today, indistinguishable except in degree: reidentification, targeting, and concealed influence in even more immersive, inescapable, pervasive, and immutable forms.\n\nBut while Web3 exposes users to more risk, it presents a unique opportunity to abandon outmoded frameworks in favor of identity and privacy schemes that center individual autonomy and agency. This is an opportunity that nobody, least of all those building Web3, can afford to ignore.\n\n## References\n\nBurkert, H.

"​主编：东入海\n\n副编：大耳兄\n\n\\#桌上有酒，心里有火\n\n***导读：我们感觉行业变化很快，信息总是滞后，运营方面没有好的文章沉淀下来。所以我们选择去做这个事，发掘价值项目，触达核心团队，总结Web3运营玩法，带给焰火的朋友们！***\n\n本期焰火酒馆请来了JediSwap创始人Rohit Goyal，他分享了进入Web3之前的经历，聊了聊Web3社区、用户、产品、DAO、熊市以及其他。以下，Enjoy：\n\n![致力于链接与合作的一个从业者社区](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e99cqkauLn4wRQOS0Egcc.jpg?height=1500&width=2000)\n\n**1、 Hi,Rohit，欢迎做客焰火酒馆，可以讲讲你自己嘛？你是如何跳进Web3兔子洞的？在那之前你在做什么？**\n\n在过去的十二年内，我在Web 2是一位连续创业者。曾经是一家电子商务公司的创始人,2010年之后创立了一家移动游戏公司Paxplay,通过社交游戏来拉近玩家之间的距离。***正当我在为这款游戏的增长而忙碌的时候，朋友向我介绍了比特币，在看完白皮书后我感到欣喜和震惊，仿佛打开了另一个世界的大门。我意识到这不仅仅是单纯的金融系统创新，更给人类如何相互链接和高效协作提供了思路。***\n\n2016年运营游戏公司的时候我同样意识到了一些中心化带来的问题，之后更加花大量的时间学习和了解Web3，研究以太坊的白皮书和其他Web3项目的白皮书。\n\n\\*2017年末,我开始了自己的第一次加密冒险，创立了Mudrex.com(https://twitter.com/officialmudrex)，总部位于班加罗尔，早期由 Y Combinator支持，已在Pre-A轮从Arkam Ventures、Tribe Capital等机构筹集650万美元。\\*模式很简单，许多人通过投资来开启他们自己的Web3旅程，而加密世界仍然是很技术流派，很复杂，对于很多人来说还很难以理解，所以我的项目就是帮他们的投资变得更简单。现如今Mudrex.com已经拥有超过50万人的用户。\n\n2020Defi 的革新让我重新思考，严格意义上来说mudrex.com还是Web2的公司。我想要更进一步，真正跳进Web3，随后我跟伙伴们成立了Mesh Finance 。建立团队需要大量技术人员，并且运营成本也会很贵，我们先组了社区，再从社区里面挑选和组建团队。\n\n在了解完以太坊，Polygon，Arbitrum以及其他的链后，我们觉得ZK Rollup 会是杀手级的技术，能在上面开发一些不可思议的东西。**那时我们注意到在Starknet上开发的团队很少， 还没有人在开发AMM，所以我们决定来做这件事，这就是JediSwap的由来。**\n\n![JediSwap社区创作](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kLfBmj9O18B2IJKULAO-v.png?height=674&width=865)\n\n**​2、在你看来社区是什么？**\n\n在我看来，不同背景的人因为同样的愿景和想象而相聚，社区(特指Discord)更像是人和工具聚合后的一个综合体。***社区有多强大，取决于人们的共同愿景有多强，共识有多强。***\n\n**3、如何去设计、运营它呢？**\n\n我们是社区发起人员，想要将Web3 展示给世界，我们相信去中心化系统、坚信每个人都享有平等进入加密世界的权利。如果你也认可我们的文化和价值观，那你便可成为社区的一员。所以当新的伙伴加入之后，大家便是同一条战线上的盟军。我们需要各自找到在团队中的位置，完成将Web3带入这个世界的任务。\n\n想象一下你将要去参加一个派对, 进入房间后发现里面许多陌生人，孤身一人的你会感到无所适从。所以社区经理的责任就是让新人来到社区之后感到宾至如归，了解他们的背景信息，在加密世界的经历以及对加密世界的看法。发现新人擅长和熟悉的领域后，试探性地问他们是否有想成为贡献者的打算。\n\n如何去定义一名贡献者？任何在JediSwap奉献过心力、时间、点子的人都会是贡献者，任何建设JediSwap的人都是贡献者。\n\n**4、我们看到JediSwap社区内活跃有序、务实强大，包括你们在和社区共建产品。背景不同的成员都会自发参与到建设当中。你们是怎么做到的？**\n\n社区内会分成不同的小组，包括研究小组，设计小组，内容小组，问题解决小组。研究小组会研究不同项目之间的差异，获取那些带给我们灵感的设计。设计小组会设计海报、视频和供社区成员使用的表情和贴纸(Sticker）， 我们推特用的海报和视频都是出自于贡献者的手中。内容板块主要由内容小组负责，他们承担了我们大部分的内容工作。此外我们还有专门的问题解决小组,项目进展过程中出现的问题可以丢到小组里，擅长解决该问题的贡献者会进行头脑风暴并给出相应方案。\n\n每个小组都会有一个Leader，比如说我是问题解决小组的Leader ， 我会去详细调研进入我小组的人，做好备案，心中有数。活来了就派发给不同的人，使大家各司其职。\n\n比如有人对DAO运营很有经验，那关于DAO的问题就可以具体咨询他们的意见。***贡献者能力越大，承担的责任越大，他们投入的心血社区成员有目共睹，社区对贡献者的信任和绑定也就会加深。同时他们也激励着更多新人投入到社区中，他们作为贡献者在积分系统中的等级会随着工作量证明而变高。***\n\n![JediSwap社区创作](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tfFzJOQD9L4Q2v6cV7z_u.png?height=708&width=865)\n\n**5、为了使整个社区更加团结一致，JediSwap还做了什么？**\n\n我们明确了运营的理念和逻辑，设置了很高的社区标准。举个简单的例子，我们还没有过要靠补贴或者抽奖的方式来促活拉新的经历 , 我们从没有提前承诺过任何回报, 成员需要真刀真枪地以自己的方式为社区做出贡献。一旦人们付出了他们的时间，他们就真正地参与到项目里面来了，在心智与情感上和社区做了绑定。在这种理念的指引下，我们做了更多机制上的设计，它们会为我们的社区带来如何的变化呢？***如今社区每个贡献者都需要把他做的所有事上传到公共区域（Public Domain） ,这意味着成员所做贡献值更透明，这是我们遵循的准则。***\n\n制订一个公平透明、开放灵活的工作证明系统 ，坚决地执行非常重要。如此一来，新成员会觉得这个社区真的有一套公平的系统，也就会奉献出全部的力气和才华。\n\n在这种情况下，就不再是你一个人想要让社区变得强大，而是你设计的机制驱使整个社区团结一致。\n\n**6.你怎么理解用户、社区、产品之间的关系以及如何去做增长？**\n\n用户和社区这两个的定义有所不同，许多项目方将两者混为一谈。我认为，用户是使用产品的一群人。拿我们自己举例，mesh finance 社区的产品是JediSwap, JediSwap 社区的产品是 AMM protocol 。但社区成员并不全是我们的用户，用户也不一定就全部进入了社区。\n\n并且，市场营销和社区运营准确来说不是一回事。\n\n我们前期在市场营销vs产品及社区打造两者之间做了取舍，选择将更多的精力投入到产品迭代和社区建设上，同时持续倾听大家的心声，收集大家的反馈。***打造一个高品质的社区始终是我们的追求，产品和社区建设是我们的“道”，市场营销是“术”，我们尽量专注于“道”的建设，而非舍本逐末。***\n\n![JediSwap社区创作](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nDbvrVBNUVunKutbILGJj.png?height=291&width=865)\n\n**7.讲讲你对DAO当下和未来的看法？**\n\n对于我来说,DAO是web3 催生出来的最激动人心的实验,也会是未来的工作方式。为什么我会有这种感受？\n\n现如今公司的形态让99%的人工作方式一成不变，他们担任着几乎不变的岗位职责，每天8-10个小时的工作时间，日复一日。你会喜欢这种工作方式嘛？ 如果你问一下身边的朋友，可能大部分都会说不喜欢。\n\n对大部分人来说，工作的目的就是去赚一些钱，养家糊口。在这个过程中你不会感受到工作带来的快乐。​\n\n相反，回顾一下你的大学生涯，你可以为了一个创意、灵感乐此不疲的跟同学探讨、碰撞想法，这是一种享受，跟打工人的心态完全不同。DAO也是如此，你在一个社区内贡献自己的力量，跟一群与你有着同样的理想和志向、同样的目标的人成长交流，这种经历会让你回想起大学那种激情燃烧的岁月。\n\n再者，一成不变的工作会让人的创造性慢慢消亡，而DAO 会让工作变得更加有趣，创造性和人的潜力得到充分发挥。想象一下你可以同时在三个不同的地方工作，每天接触不同的挑战。这会让你的不同技能获得锻炼提升，你的技能变得更加值钱。\n\n***为DAO工作意味着职业生涯不会被一份工作、一个老板、一家公司买断。人们总会找到感兴趣的DAO，从而不必担心会被辞退。当人们为DAO工作后，便很难再适应现在的工作方式。你也可以看到现在越来越多的人加入了DAO的行列***\n\n**8、目前熊市漫漫，你有什么想对Web3的创业者说的嘛？**\n\n毫无疑问，现在市场情绪很低迷，但我认为真正的Builder和创业者不会太在乎牛熊。从Web3整个行业来讲，我们依旧在很早期。***如果拿Web2的发展阶段与Web3

胡子观币：**胡子观币的OG，也是AvatarDAO的MOD。21年初进币圈，之前有9年的A股交易经验，擅长领域是NFT和二级交易市场。\n\n**j.eth：**NFT爱好者，DegenToonz持有人，该项目被盗次数相对较多，与大家分享经历和应对措施。\n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥：**DegenToonz中文社区管理人，本身是一名程序员，进入币圈5年左右，现在更多精力在于找寻优质的NFT项目。\n\n \n\n \n\n**话题一：在钱包和NFT交易平台使用中，有哪些NFT的安全常识？**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**有个朋友曾想把他的一个NFT转走，不断的往钱包里面冲gas费，然后黑客就不断的转走，这黑客应该是写了一个监控工具加一个机器人。往钱包里冲多少，他就能转出多少，所以他就一直没办法把NFT转出来。我们自己是之前在韩国女友还有杀手女友比较火的时候买了不少，结果被一个钓鱼网站骗了。我们没有在官方的discord里面，然后有人私信我们，他就说可以低价买。因为之前也没有这种经验，所以就点进去了。点完了之后，他是要求你钱包去签名去授权，然后没有仔细看就点确定了，他就得到这个所有的NFT的，一个授权、签名，所以这个NFT就全部被转走了。那这个是平台，一定要在正规的交易平台，比如说opensea，looks这些，然后你要去识别平台的域名等，看这个平台是不是一个正规的平台，或者是不是官方的mint界面，一般这种官方mint界面，他都会写在项目方的Twitter主页或者discord他会专门开一个频道。关于这个钱包来说呢？其实就是对于用户自己来讲，就是要把这个私钥保存好。不能把私钥写在一些云笔记或者云盘上面，这个是非常危险的。因为一旦这种中心化的云笔记产品或者云盘，他们的这个服务器有漏洞或者安全威胁的话，那你这个私钥有黑客拿工具去扫满足这个私钥格式的内容。然后他一般脱完库之后，比如说云笔记的数据库被脱了之后呢，黑客就直接在这个被拖的这个数据库里面去寻找对应格式的私钥，然后他会去批量做一个转账处理。所以这个时候不能把这个私钥放在云盘上面，或者放在云笔记上面，建议的话就是最好私钥自己用纸写下来，或者自己用冷钱包管理自己的主账号，去玩NFT或者去打土狗的时候，用一些小号，这就是我个人的一个经验，一个防范的措施。\n\n \n\n**Piaoxue.eth|胡子观币：**补充几点我自己的一些习惯，我的每个钱包都会控制一下，就比方说NFT，有些单个也比较贵，那基本就贵的那些，每一个钱包就放这个NFT，然后别的什么也不放，我还有时候隔一段时间会把这个钱包里的全都转到一个新钱包，就因为之前有一些授权，可能自己点了也就忘记了，你要是去取消我不太会操作，我就直接去建一个新的，把它转过去。然后第2个就是不要随便点那些链接，很多都会给空投吗？我自己是从来不点，也不会领。然后discord，私信也都不会看的，总体就是减少这个风险暴露。平台我自己只用opensea、looks和X2Y2这3个，别的都没有用过。私钥，刚才老师说的这个私钥不要放在云盘上，然后我实际就放在云盘上，但我是把那个私钥的首尾2个地方颠倒过来了，就是那个字母跟数字颠倒过来，这样相当于如果是他拿到了也不一定能看得明白，或者说他直接复制也用不了。还有一个就是我自己一直想了解，但是我自己没用过，就是定期清理授权这个。我不知道有没有哪个老师能帮我讲一下，因为我之前看到过别人也是建议，定期就给钱包把授权都取消一遍。如果这个有谁知道，也教教我。\n\n \n\n**WaTell：**他这个东西其实挺简单的，因为我们现在购买NFT一般都是用这个MateMask小狐狸钱包，浏览器上会有一个MetaMask的这个插件，我们点开这个插件之后，他这个页面上在你的名字或者说在你的那个域名那一行其实有一个3个小点，就竖着的小点，然后你点开之后它有四项最下边是一项就是这个已连接的网站。然后她一点开之后就能看到你用这个钱包连接过哪些网站连接过哪些域名，你把你那些不想继续连接的这些网站取消掉，就点那个断开就可以了。这个东西其实还挺简单的，然后也挺安全的。我一般每次交互完一个网站，或者说mint完一个之后，就会把这个网站的连接给断开。\n\n \n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥：**我可以补充一点就是，你要清除授权的话，你也可以以太坊浏览器上面。它上面有一个标题栏，有一个就是token approve，你就可以从那里看到你当前连接的钱包有哪些授权你也可以从那里清除授权。钱包，我现在用的钱包就是2个钱包。一个Trust Wallet钱包，加上Meta Mask是我用到的，我现在的话，分了3个钱包就3种类型的，一个就是我从来不会动的差不多也算冷钱包是只进不出的，另外一个就是热钱包是只在opensea进行一个买卖的，另外一个就是小号，小号就是专门用来冲一些土狗mint。交易平台，我现在只会用opensea，还有looks。基本上还是在opensea，也不建议去其他平台。我说的其他交易平台就是，简单举个例子，假如说，我在discord加入了其他社群，就会有一堆人来私信你，你也不知道他干啥的，但是他会给你发个链接，一般像这种的情况下都是诈骗的。\n\n \n\n**j.eth：**现在黑客的手段非常多。我自己说一下我的立场吧。我是一个从币圈过来的，但是怎么发的家呢？那个狗狗跟屎币，然后进入NFT的那个时间，大约也就是半年左右,其实我觉得跟那个虚拟货币的区别不大，现在这个市场和去年的那个币圈的市场大约也是同一个时间，土狗层出不穷，而且各种各样，和那些不一样的是，NFT有各种各样可以获取的渠道，Freemint呀或者是进入到他们自己的网站mint呀，这些其实都需要授权的。然后其实黑客他可以把你东西盗走的，无非也就是从通过授权盗走，或者是通过你给的合约盗走，或者是盗取你的钱包，对吧？我首先第一点先从钱包上面来说的话，就是大家下载钱包一定要去官方网站下载。我曾经很多币圈的朋友就是因为去加telegram的社区。然后他们有的时候会给到一些什么这个钱包更新了呀，大家要用这个钱包去下载更新啊。可能咱们就点进去这个东西里面所有的一切跟正常的钱包是一模一样的。但唯一不一样的就是他能拿走你的钱包里面所有的钱。我大部分高质量的也就是价格相对较高的NFT，会有一个新钱包，这个新钱包呢，就是我觉得可以长期持有的，我都会放到硬件钱包里。另一些，比如Freemint呀，或者是我觉得不会持有太久，就会那个出逃获利的。我也是拿新钱包。就是拿几个新钱包去Freemint把这个gas正常花了之后，我再转到我的集中的一个钱包里面，大家可能在NFT圈，discord里面，他们有一个很常见的那个骗人的手段就是跟你私信说这个东西要免费mint了或者是怎么。他们和一些普通的那个网站还不太一样，进去之后，它上面会显示mint的数量，它会不断的变高，那意思就是你要是现在买，他马上就没了。我的第一次NFT被骗mint的就是这么来的。还有一个就是，现在很多类型的免费的空投，上面显示一个非常高的Offer。有人试过了，点了同意了Offer之后你的NFT就没了钱也没了。但是我可能那个对于程序员这方面代码不太了解，具体它是什么一个原理。\n\n \n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**关于刚刚说的那个空投。我们有专门去研究过它的合约逻辑，他们会利用一些数据平台，然后他们会筛选出一批高质量的客户，比如说你持有bayc这种蓝筹持有者，他们会筛选出一批这样的地址。然后他们会写一个相当于广告NFT的合约，它能自动的在生成的时候，就把这个广告的这些小图片直接空投到你地址上去。他直接利用这种方式，就相当于流氓广告一样，反正你又不能拒收，第三步就会写一个程序，对你的这个广告的NFT去做非常高价的Offer。当然他也会评估你的资产和他Offer的这个钱，一个价值衡量。如果他是有的赚的，那他就给你Offer，然后Offer完了之后，他会改那个合约里面的相关的函数。他会加一个流氓逻辑就是说你如果接受这个Offer，就要对这些NFT的资产做一个approve，你一旦approved之后，他就可以把你的所有的NFT全转走了，这个是比较形成产业化了，有不少黑客已经批量的在这么干了。这个技术手段比较高的，所以说也非常的防不胜防。\n\n \n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥：**我补充一下，刚刚说的这个问题，我也是经常收到一些空投到我钱包里面，有两个，一个是你点进去的时候它有个详情。在左边描述里面有很多链接，如果你是点了这里面的链接的话，就会被盗了，诈骗就是通过点了这个网址被骗的。然后另外一种就是，我也没去尝试啊，就是钱包里面经常有一些在head里面的他给你Offer这种我没有去接受啊，就是这种的话，是很早之前的了，但是我没去做，就是他会给你一个很高的Offer。\n\n \n\n**WaTell：**我简单总结了一下，有很多点和我这个经历是一样的。我所有的钱包的助记词还有这个私钥都是全都是记录到我的一个本子上，而且是要记录两次，因为我怕记录一次的话会记错了，到时候就没办法找回这个钱包了。还有一点非常重要，就是主动私聊你的基本上都是骗子。这个东西是非常需要大家谨记一句话。就像飘雪哥，他那个私钥虽然是保存在网盘里，但是它会把那个首尾字母颠倒一下。然后猫哥是把这个密码本保存在自己的大脑里，通过自己这种储存习惯，然后来进行一种助记词的这种存储。这种习惯还真的蛮有趣，因为黑客可以盗取你的这种信息，但是他永远都不会知道你大脑里的这种密码本的习惯。所以说如果大家是真的很懒不像我一样就是一个字一个字把它记下来那你们可以去学一下飘雪哥还有猫哥这种方法。然后还有一点就是大家使用这个MetaMask的时候进行交互，那个插件会有一个弹窗会提醒你，是要求你授权还是要求你签名？这个网站要求是你进行授权的话，那我们千万不要进行这个点击确定，因为要求你进行授权的这些网站，基本上99%全都是那种钓鱼网站，或者骗子网站，真正的正规的网站，它要求你进行交互的时候，只是会要求你进行一个签名，是绝对不可能要求你进行授权的。然后最后一点，就是官方网站的问题。我搜索框里输入了X2y2网站，然后我点击搜索结第一行，他是一个骗子网站，它一般前面都会有2个字就是广告。我有一个朋友前几天就经历过这样的事情，他来进行一个网站交互的时候，他点击了那个前面会有一个广告提示那个网站，然后他进去之后不仅进行了交互，而且他那个网站提示你私钥就是那个助记词出现了问题，他还把那个助记词输入了然后，就被盗取了蛮多钱的。所以说大家就是在网上冲浪的时候一定不要图快就是慢一步其实有的时候会帮你减少很多损失，这也是我的一个经验吧。我其实是一个非常严格执行这些条例的人，所以我基本上web3世界完全没有被盗过一次。\n\n \n\n \n\n**话题二：NFT有哪些被盗风险？**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**我们之前总结过，就是被盗主要有哪几种形式，第一种就是邮件，邮件钓鱼就是黑客会批量的给邮箱去发钓鱼网站的邮件，第2种就是高仿的域名，他可能花钱买广告了然后他就排在这个前面。第3种，就是MetaMask的假钱包。比如说到了他的网站上之后，它会弹出来一个跟MetaMask长得一模一样的这个弹窗你以为浏览器的插件弹出来的钱包弹窗，其实它是利用前端的效果做得跟那个弹窗几乎一模一样，然后第4种，就是很多discord机器人给你发DM，最后一个呢就是官方的这种discord被盗了，那这个时候就要有一定自己的识别和甄别能力，我大概总结就是这几种。\n\n \n\n**Piaoxue.eth|胡子观币：**我补充一点就是有一个私钥泄露的风险。比方说有一些账号，他可能是社区共管的这种类型，那可能有别的人，比方说在复制的这个私钥的过程中，它的这个输入法也是存在一个泄露风险的，可能是在这种情况下把私钥泄露出去，最后导致这个钱包被盗。\n\n \n\n**j.eth：**个人经历的话其实更多的被盗的应该是我在玩币的时候，NFT现在应该算是老油条了，应该是不太会被盗走，其实说白了就是不要点假的链接，不要相信任何天上掉下的馅饼，不要想到占便宜，自己什么也没付出，突然发一笔横财再多说一句，就是我的私钥和我的助记词怎么弄呢？都是抄下来之后放在了保险箱里。我觉得没有任何东西会比保险箱更加的保险。\n\n \n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥：**其实刚刚Allen已经说的很全了。我举2个例子，他刚刚说的邮件，在opensea进行换合约的时候，有很多人收到了假的邮件，那次的损失是比较惨重的。另外一次，在猴的地要出来的时候，提前mint猴地的链接，损失了好一部分。然后后来有一次，猴子的discord又被盗了，几个人也是受到伤害了。我想说的就是即便你关注的是推特或者是discord或者是ins，你都要想到这些都是可能被盗的。大家这个意识一定要警惕，然后第2个就是在你点授权的时候可以看一下小狐狸弹出来那个信息，看一下它是不是安全的。\n\n \n\n**WaTell：**大家可以考虑搞一个这种冷钱包，我们基本上有那么几个旧手机，就是重新设置一下出厂设置，在那个就手机上下载一个MetaMask，然后完全不连接网络，你的手机手动的变成那个冷钱包。怎么去鉴别这些风险其实也是蛮重要的一个东西，因为现在很多骗局和骗子这个技术，它确实太高，不光我们在与时俱进，骗子的骗术，这个技术也在时刻进步，让我们这些NFT玩家基本上就是防不胜防。然后还有这个之前出现这种给你传一个PDF文件，都能把你的这个钱包全都给盗走了。\n\n \n\n \n\n**话题三：如何鉴别NFT的潜在风险？**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**我觉得首先就是提高自己的一个鉴别和认知能力。如果你不能看懂代码，你可以利用一些工具，直接告诉你这个合约它是不是只能买不能卖的，或者是不是一个貔貅合约。第2个，我觉得做任何操作都不要着急，比如说你想去mint一个新的NFT，去查一下，比如说推特发的东西，去社群里面真正感受一下，再去做一些投资决策，或者做一些交互的决定。我还想补充的一点就是这个web3这个领域的玩家，其实很多人刚刚进来，没有很强的认知能力或者识别风险的能力，所以我觉得从两方面可以对这个问题去做一些有效的解决方案吧。第一方面我觉得我们要推动这种防盗意识这个科普，这个是我们从业人员或者说进来已经玩了很久了这些人应该去帮他们去搭建一个未来，让他们进来的时候有一个比较好环境。第2个，我觉得我们作为技术人员，应该得有一些自己创新的意识，或者说想要去解决这些问题的一个冲动，不能说这个合约它一成不变，黑客就是掌握绝对的话语权，用自己的技术，能力去跟他们做一个挑战。比如说我们可以在这个合约上做创新，或者去发展硬件。\n\n \n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**这个就引申到就是我们之前自己也是被盗了。之前我们是在互联网做安全相关的事情。代码分析这种，我们这个web2领域是属于安全意识非常高的。那来到web3领域之后，即使是我们这样的安全团队也会被黑客攻击，被黑客去钓鱼，那我觉得对于其他的这些小白不能让他们也跟我们一样，一进来，这个钱就损失了。所以我们自己在这个技术上面做了一些创新，我们就是要做一个你盗不走的NFT，比如说NFT长时间决定了要当钻石手不想卖了，那我可以帮在合约上面去加一个函数去帮助你把这个NFT锁起来，就是说你无论怎么样，这个NFT都转不走，除非你自己某一天想要卖了你就可以到我们的这个平台上去把这个NFT解锁，这个时候它才能被交易才能被转让。所以说，一旦你的私钥被盗了，黑客还得去突破第2层去到网站上去解锁。那解锁的时候我们是要求用户提供手机验证码或者邮箱验证码或者谷歌验证码，这个时候，黑客光攻击你的私钥外他还得把你的邮箱也盗了。所以我们觉得，符合用户的一个使用习惯，因为不管是币安或者说discord，都有邮箱验证这些措施。\n\n \n\n**WaTell：**咱们在这个自己的网站上又进行了一次防护，帮助持有者进行保管？那我想知道这个保管过程也安全吗？会不会黑客先把咱们这个网站给攻破，然后通过这里面数据库再去攻占其他的这些网站呢？\n\n \n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**实现这个其实也不简单，首先我们要去做链下的预言机，然后通过预言机去控制这个NFT的组合，然后去实现加锁解锁。这个后台服务器是拥有对这个预言机的最高权限，所以说这个时候就会带来一个问题如果我们的这个网站崩了，或者被黑客打挂了，他就可以随意的加解锁，我们解决这个问题是分为2步，前期我们肯定会使用一些中心化安全防护，后面会把网站去迁移到去中心化的算力的网络上面，这个就保证第一个我们自己人是没法做恶的，因为它是一个去中心化的部署应用。第2个，防止了单点脆弱性，不会因为一个点被打挂了，整个这个链路就崩溃了。\n\n \n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥：**我觉得很简单的判断方法就是，每天都有这么多新的项目，你首先看一下他这个NFT有没有成交量？这是第一个判断的依据。第2个判断你在mint之前把他的合约打开一下，然后在asking里面输入合约地址，看一下交易记录，找几个是mint的，打开他的交易记录。把mint那个人的地址抓出来看看，他是不是一个真实玩家。看看别人的mint记录可以简单判断这是不是一个安全合约。\n\n \n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**因为我们本身做代码分析的，所以我们后续会专门针对那个NFT的合约出一个分析的教程或者小工具。直接告诉你，比如说你当前交互的NFT合约，属于哪个标准的，在哪些函数上做了一些改动，或者说这个Mint之后能不能卖，他会不会盗取你多余的授权。我们可能会做一个小工具，让用户能够去非常方便鉴别代码。\n\n \n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**现在这个黑客，他可能把这个私钥也盗了，邮箱也盗了。那这个时候我们还提供了一个召回的功能，就是有点像opensea，你被盗了之后去把这个黑产去打标，那这个过程其实也是跟我们一样，我们进行仲裁了之后会把这个打标，其实是不能解决问题的，一定要防止黑客转赃要防止它二次转移，就是他转到自己钱包，或者说他低价Offer。过程当中我们要防止它二次转移，所以我们要对一次转移的一个行为做一个风控的识别，就是要去识别是不是一个异常行为，我们总结一次转移一般什么情况下是一个异常行为呢？要么就是把一个自己的NFT转到不常用的钱包地址上。第2种，是别人给我一个非常低价的Offer，在opensea上，或者在其他的交易平台上。然后我接受了，这个也是比较异常的。第3个，就是他拿到了我的这个授权，然后转走了。然后我们会去识别异常行为，我们会对你的第二次转移做一个时间的限制，自己可以在平台上设置，他这个反应时间是12个小时还是24个小时。在时间内它都是能够防止黑客去销赃的。做这个事情其是帮助他们即使被盗了，也能防止这个真正发生财产的损失。也能够帮他们直接把NFT召回，就是直接reclaim到他的原来的账户上，或者reclaim到这个项目方的账户上。\n\n \n\n \n\n**话题四：NFT被盗后如何维权？**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**我们当时被盗了之后，就是给这个opensea他们去举报，然后去让他们把这个黑产去打标，但是opensea的仲裁过程其实蛮长的啊，两三天之后我的被盗的才打上标，第2个是你要在社区里面去找一些大佬帮你喊。第3个，你可以用这工具给黑客地址去做一些妥协吧，比如说愿意半价把这个NFT再买回来，这样你可以少损失一半的钱，当然妥协这件事情我是不会做的，大概就是这几种方法吧，所以我们在这个合约创意上也是做了一个就是帮助用户在事后可以去做一些事情的方法。\n\n \n\n**Piaoxue.eth | 胡子观币：**我自己的话没有被盗过，但我身边朋友确实有被盗的。他应该是因为私钥泄露，钱包被盗了，里边有一个月鸟，还有其他的加密货币，总体有100万左右的人民币的一个损失，然后他就去报警了，立案的过程比较艰难，但最后应该是已经立案了，立案之后可以通过数据分析，慢雾啊，他们可以帮他去找这个当时盗他的地址，然后IP，包括交易所的kyc，但是最后好像查到了可能的人，那其中有一些人用的是假kyc，但是报警的确是一个可行的选择。在国内，就比方说你的这个金额超过50万的话，你可以尝试一下去报警，提供一些你的材料。我自己在买猴子的时候，其实买过2个猴子都是被盗的，一个是opensea上买的，我买的时候他没被盗，因为那个时候美国那边就是晚上，等于是半夜被人盗了直接就挂出来，我就买了，买了以后，他还通过推特跟我沟通，说这个是被盗的。然后他说他会去opensea上仲裁。然后后来果然就被opensea给锁了。我觉得这也是需要行业内去讨论怎么解决的问题，下家毕竟也是花了真金白银去买的。我特别认可刚才allen他们要做这个事儿，我理解他们可能是要做一个线上保险柜的这种业务，他可以给我整体账户做一个保障，哪怕说我私钥被盗了，还有可能去他们那里去验证一步，就能很大程度去增加黑客盗你NFT的难度。\n\n** \n **\n\n**话题五：NFT被盗经历分享**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**第一次是被骗的，我mint了杰伦熊，结果卖得比较早，卖光了之后他就飞涨，然后杰伦熊的discord里面有人给我发DM，他说这个只要零点几就能mint了然后赶紧冲，我就赶紧mint了一个，结果就被骗，这个是比较低级的一个。另外一个是点击到一个链接，他直接让钱包做授权。然后这个授权就是把你的所有NFT都拿走了，主要就是这2个经历，然后我就非常生气，就是感觉这个领域的骗子也太嚣张了，然后又觉得我们自己本身就是做安全的，就觉得这也太丢人了。我们几个就去商量怎么去跟他们作对抗打击他们，就慢慢的有了今天的这些想法。这是我自己的一个经历。\n\n \n\n**j.eth：**不小心进了一个骗子网站，mint的剩余数量显示越来越少，就赶紧去mint，mint的时候你会发现他本来上面写的是0.5或者是0.05但是他mint的时候就是把你那个钱包里面所有的以太坊全部转走。我也不知道这个是什么操作，这我是亏最惨的。大家呢不论是玩NFT还是玩币，一定不要fomo，大家不要觉得这个东西买不到了，钱就赚不到了。我在币圈里面总结了一个经验就是这个没有了下一个可能比这个还厉害，就是我的经历。关于NFT被盗，也有很多项目方的自导自演，就是包括很多币被盗，可能都是项目方的自导自演。当然了，我这也没有办法查证，毕竟咱人微言轻啊，身处的国家也不同。关于跨国啊，这个我还真经历过一回，也是一个黑客，把整个农场里面所有的币盗走的一个事儿。当时我在中国，因为我是那个币里边相当大的一个大户，我的钱都放进农场里面去挖矿了，这个黑客也是项目方技术人员之一。然后现在在新加坡，然后这个项目方呢，是美国人在美国啊。大家想一想这个东西有多复杂，想抓也没有那么简单。大家一定要想好的一个问题，千万不要贪小便宜，只要不贪小便宜，别人就骗不着你。而且我一直以来信奉的一个东西，就是一定要拿自己额外的钱进入这个web3或者是玩NFT也好，玩币也好，不要去把自己的身家压上。\n\n \n\n**Piaoxue.eth

胡子观币：**我的话没有什么被盗经历能分享，我觉得我可以一个受害者的角度跟大家分享一下，就是我买到被盗的之后怎么办的问题，尤其是在opensea上买到的，他后面才标记的这种就挺亏的，我大概比地板价低了5%左右吧，才卖掉的。去Looks上卖的。我觉得这个体验就很不好，买到一个图，结果当天或者第2天他就跟我说我这个是被盗的，然后我也不能把它认证了，所以我觉得这个是受害者视角体验很差，希望粉丝能想一个更好的解决方法，不然的话是对他下面的用户不负责任。很不公平。我是建议，就未来有没有可能就是行业达成某一个协议也好，或者是达成一个新的共识吧。就这个事儿，最后就是一个个人行为，不要牵扯到下家的问题了。\n\n \n\n**JJJ丨AvatarDao：**NFT被盗我没有过，但是我钱包被盗过，有以太坊雪崩链上的币，他给我盗走了，但至今到现在，我也不知道是怎么给我盗的。我链上看了地址，他好多的交易记录都是在coinlist相关，但是我不知道他是怎么给我盗走的，有哪些交集在这些平台上，所以为什么会我们会聚焦在这个地方被这类的人盗走，那可能是我哪儿泄露了比如私钥。我就是总结一些经验，我复制过我的私钥，在微信发过，从我的手机传到我的电脑上，这样复制过，也许会跟这个有关，但是我不确定，就警戒大家这个，从那个之后，我没有再复制过这个私钥了，这种方式一定不要用，它还是有一定的安全隐患。\n\n \n\n**C919.eth：**我是完全赖自己。那个时候不懂，整了个MetaMask钱包也不懂什么助记词不能泄露啊，拿手机截的屏，我后来怀疑我被盗的过程应该是在那个电报群谁发了个什么链接点链接免费领空头时候确认授权了吧，然后丢了几张不值钱的图片，我就这么一个经历，这就是想说新人特别容易被盗，就是什么都不懂时候。现在我防盗的方式是认为以后要长期持有的，我会把它转到一个新钱包，这个钱包只在一个iPhone上，然后这个iPhone什么都不下载，只有一个微信，一个钱包，剩下什么都没有，就当一个硬件钱包用。\n\n \n\n**anling.eth：**我没有过NFT被盗的经验，但是我的钱包被盗了，我了解的一个项目，就潜伏到他们discord想学习他们怎么运营的，就有人给我发私信说他们的那个特别便宜。然后我就点了进去，应该就是连接了他们的网站，在最后一步，我的同事拦住我说这是骗子，但是我那个时候应该我的钱包已经暴露了。但是当时不知道，后来想买一个东西，我就往里面转了钱，转了好几次钱，发现我的钱为什么都消失了我还觉得很奇怪是我打错了，后来发现就被盗了，我的经历就是这样，所以说其实就是对于新人进入这个行业还是要有一定的时间先去学习安全方面的知识，我觉得在我们这个圈子还是比较缺乏的，所以说我们这个项目就很希望去帮助大家提高安全意识，如何去防盗，然后让大家不要这么轻易的就犯这种错误\n\n \n\n**C919.eth：**我感觉如果能在最初期刚接触的时候被盗，他不一定是一件坏事儿，就是你真被盗一次，然后你才真正的有这个经历，这个防范意识。\n\n \n\n**JJJ丨AvatarDao：**我是觉得这个主题在现在我们这个阶段就特别合适。安全方面的一个问题，因为现在这个行情，咱们谈怎么赚钱，其实没什么意思吗？除了2级，即使项目这块也没有什么，但是安全这块就是包括钱包啊，这些都是说在我们币圈一个比较基础的内容，而不是说像比如交易或者是搞项目，哪些人能赚钱，都需要沉淀时间去了解去学习的，像我们趟过这种被骗的雷，你在这个阶段跟交易不同，你是完全可以避开这个雷的，因为它是一些基础知识，你可以直接需要通过，比如我们今天这些嘉宾也好，工具也好，这些介绍都可以了解到，避免被盗，跟大家说一下，真的不是危言耸听，可能大家觉得玩了好久了，我也没被盗，怎么那么容易被盗？当你被盗的时候就是你非常无助，你没有任何办法，盗了你的钱就是没了，希望引起大家重视\n\n \n\n**WaTell：**可能有的时候确实需要一次惨痛经历才能让我们成长，才能让我们讲这个记性。然后我们今天搞这个Space，也是希望通过大家，嘉宾的这些经验，或者说这种惨痛经历能给大家起到一种警示的作用，帮助大家即使不用被实地的骗过一次，也可以获得这种比较强的安全保护意识。\n\n \n\n**TurtlecaseGang：**我们这个NFT项目呢是永不被盗的，所以说如果你在其他地方遭遇过被盗的经历啊，或者说这个钱都丢失的，很无助的这种经历的话，那我觉得可以来看看我们这个项目以及我们做的合约的创新。",

{"id": "U1KLl8_QbUAWZ1-9E14jwWnJ7bh2zuBKMxDSbk-QOhg", "title": "SpakDAO趋势研究丨元宇宙趋势展望：货币化和规模化", "body": "SparkDAO是一支專注在数字加密领域的投研小組，成员分布在全球。我们热衷于挖掘數字加密領域的底層邏輯和前沿賽道。歡迎關注我們的Twitter：SparkDAO_io\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_MzrlEu3_7r_hvbFZLciv.jpg?height=388&width=900)\n\n### 元宇宙现有问题\n\n在元宇宙的早期体验中，某些方面会阻止用户在游戏中的沉浸感。用户不断被提醒当前的元宇宙状态不属于他们开发和构建，而是属于那些创造这种体验的人。例如，玩家不能从“魔兽世界”中拿走稀有的剑，卖掉，然后在“第二人生”中买房子，活动仅限于中心化的平台所有者。Twitter与Instagram也处于分离状态，虽然有社交渠道将它们联系起来，但它们由不同的公司创建，二者之间没有正式的信息或价值转移。换句话说，它们存在于有限的、孤立的空间中，而不是一个完整的元宇宙。\n\n理想情况下，元宇宙的进一步发展将把所有具有独立价值的不同生态系统汇集到一个单一的有凝聚力的虚拟环境中。这个环境由各方之间无缝交互，以创建一个大于部分的整体。在共享的虚拟环境中创建一个人们可以共存的开放世界，而不是被不同的生态系统分割。以这种方式运行的系统将通过虚拟空间构建真正的平行现实。用户可以拥有商品，将自己呈现为可识别的数字化身，并像在物理世界中一样在虚拟世界中穿行。元宇宙应用程序、体验和数字商品互连系统的概念已经在进行中，并且正在结合区块链技术和去中心化预言机进行构建。\n\n### 元宇宙的可能性和货币化\n\n相对于传统系统，区块链作为不受任何实体控制的公共网络，在可组合性和透明性方面具有先天优势。区块链上的游戏项目、Defi协议、NFT艺术收藏等都可以通过底层基础设施连接起来，该基础设施允许无缝转移价值并快速构建体现元宇宙所需的经过验证的经济模型——真正的所有权和互操作性。\n\n目前，科技巨头们都通过付费商业模式提供数字商品。用户无法真正拥有他们听的音乐、观看的电影和节目、以及虚拟角色账户。所有这些都是用户通过订阅费或隐藏费用租用的，例如以广告或收集个人数据的形式。通过区块链、加密货币和NFT，实现了经过验证的数字所有权，用户可以随心所欲地买卖其数字商品。这是元宇宙和用户拥有的元经济的主要催化剂。数字商品可以存在于创建它们的项目之外，并且在项目失败之后仍然存在，就像可以拥有一家已经关闭的公司的实物产品一样。\n\n在区块链的帮助下，用户能够像拥实体产品一样拥有数字产品。代币或NFT在转入用户的数字钱包后，成为他的财产。这加强了用户在虚拟世界的沉浸感，因为NFT在虚拟空间中增强了数字持久性和身份的概念，模仿构成物理现实的无形社会框架，并在物理和数字之间创建了可比较的平行世界。\n\n以太坊等区块链网络的一个标志是强大的互操作性。由于有一个共同的底层基础设施，所有建立在区块链上的项目都能够相互交互，使生态系统能够连接起来，创造统一的用户体验。借助区块链技术，用户可以在一个平台上使用Defi协议、玩P2E游戏、购买NFT，访问相互关联的生态系统，在该生态系统中可以交易NFT、进行贷款、或者使用游戏收入购买NFT。由于这些活动都发生在区块链网络上，因此存在内部互操作性，使用户拥有基于区块链的一体式在线体验，这是创建连贯元宇宙的重要组成部分。\n\n目前，许多元宇宙平台都是基于区块链的虚拟现实，可以从移动设备和桌面访问。用户可以在元宇宙中购买虚拟土地，通过数字化身与其他用户互动，并访问各种用户创建的社交活动。这是首批基于区块链的元宇宙实验之一，将真正的所有权和游戏化社交功能与区块链互操作性相结合。数字土地所有者可以举办音乐会、彩票等虚拟活动，活动体验结合了早期“第二人生”虚拟世界和流行的VR游戏VRChat的各个方面。但是，与这些一对一的活动不同，用户可以将自己的土地出售给参与者，赋能和增加用户的收入，这类似于现实生活中的土地购买。\n\n### 元宇宙盈利方式\n\n元宇宙的各个社区都由与现实生活中相同的人组成，主要盈利方式如下：\n\n**购物。**在元宇宙中，一线品牌的东西很受欢迎。香奈儿和阿玛尼已进入了虚拟空间，并以比实物服装更高的价格销售数字虚拟服装。对于元宇宙玩家来说，这项业务潜力巨大。\n\n**艺术品**。与数字服装相似，用户还可以将出售各种图片、照片、视频、游戏角色等，例如Axie Infinity的宠物售价可达数百到数千美元。\n\n**挖矿。**例如，在Alien Worlds等游戏中，玩家可以挖掘并获得TLM等代币。\n\n**土地转售**。这是一种高风险的赚钱方式，到目前为止，它被认为是富人的特权。Sandbox上最昂贵的一笔土地交易达到了430万美元。\n\n### 扩展元宇宙的可能性\n\n元宇宙要得到真正的大规模采用需要以下方面的支持：\n\n**设备。**智能手机已成为社交网络发展的催化剂。元宇宙的情况也是如此，VR耳机、触觉手套、传感器的普及将推进元宇宙的规模采用。\n\n**网络**。元宇宙必须持续、实时地工作，并同时为数百万用户提供访问权限。这需要高带宽和分散的数据传输。\n\n**计算**。除了速度，设备的功率也很重要，用于处理物体的物理特性、渲染、协调和同步数据与人工智能、投影、动作捕捉等。\n\n**平台。**元宇宙处于早期发展阶段，最终目标是让用户能够尽可能舒适地与平台交互。\n\n**新标准。**元界的发展和用户之间的交互，以及Web2的发展，都需要新的格式、服务、引擎和其他机制，必须支持版权、数据导出导入、渲染技术、人工智能等。\n\n**付款。**元宇宙不仅是新一代的社交网络，也是一个全新的经济。它需要去中心化的支付服务和其他能够满足这个虚拟世界及其用户需求的金融工具。\n\n**新内容**。为了使元宇宙成为主流，必须保持内容更新。此类内容不仅可以通过特殊方式创建，还可以进行销售、购买、存储等。另外，还需要一个新系统来管理虚拟世界中的数字资产。\n\n**用户行为。**用户必须学习如何在元宇宙中互动，这需要人、公司和品牌之间的互动。\n\n### 小结\n\n近几年，元宇宙已经从各种小说作品中描绘的幻想未来开始发展为真实存在的现实，为下一批沉浸式虚拟世界应用的出现奠定了基础，其背后的核心技术也在稳步发展。尽管元宇宙的未来状态尚未确定，但开发人员、设计师、用户和梦想家将会创建一个由去中心化、沉浸式和连接性定义的用户拥有的数字世界。\n\n\\*此处表达的观点和意见仅为作者的观点和意见，不一定反映SparkDAO的观点。每一項投資和交易都涉及風險，在做出決策時，你應該有自己的判斷！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6Q-jqnyGkv02hwz0PVH0Z.jpg?height=700&width=1500)\n\n", "timestamp": 1657164424, "digest": "vjq9_PZp2nm61rQD8nrWFVPbfVidfXFNGZo3KfMw3kE", "contributor": "0xee51068dcC599b06341b3401e578e7C68A7D97E1"}

It can bring benefits to human civilization.\n2. Some people want it and pay a good price.\n\nThey are completely different, but they do not conflict with each other.\n\nThings could be used those means to explain their value. For Examples:\n\n**Electric Power** In my opinion, electric power brings benefits to human civilization. And normal people get it very cheap.\n\n**Hermès's bag** From my point of view luxury goods doesn't bring anything to human civilization. But they are very very expensive.\n\n**SpaceX's rocket** I honestly think that the rocket brings great benefits to human civilization, and it is very expensive.\n\n**Current the article** As far as I'm concerned, this article neither brings anything to human civilization, nor no one wants to pay any price.\n\nIf you ask me what is the value of blockchain now, I need to know which value is you asked for.\n\nI will discuss each value of blockchain below.\n\n## Blockchain brings human civilization benefit\n\n### What is blockchain?\n\nI try to explain blockchain in simple words. From my point of view, blockchain is a digital ownership management system base on math and cryptography. It can not modify history records. It only adds records.\n\nBlockchain gives wallet address ownership. Every wallet address is equal. They trust each other. There is the most important thing on the blockchain.\n\nIn my way of thinking all blockchain products from the digital ownership management.\n\n### From Homo sapiens win to publish The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America\n\nI read about how Homo sapiens won in a book. Because Homo sapiens create language, then they used language to get trust in each other. Finally, Homo sapiens gained consensus and killed Neanderthals.\n\nTo my mind, The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America was a consensus reached by the representatives of the 13 colonies after mutual trust and discussion. Currently, that consensus creates the No.1 country on the earth.\n\nFrom the above two examples, I believe that consensus and trust are the cornerstones of human civilization.\n\nBut in the real world an interesting thing. Every single one of them has seven deadly sins. It is very difficult to reach a consensus through trust inside the real world.\n\nThis has led to various problems in current human civilization.\n\n### Blockchain's vision of the value it brings to human civilization\n\nBlockchain is a natural solution to the trust and consensus problem. Human being gets one more way to build trust and consensus. This may provide an additional option for solving the problems of human civilization.\n\nTo my way of thinking blockchain will be like electric power. It will exist everywhere. It acts as a basic component for humans in the scenario of trust, consensus, and ownership. The new approach will then reconfigure the entire human organizational system. Humanity will open the next era.\n\n## How much is Blockchain?\n\nSome people ask, \"Why are BTC, ETH, and NFT so expensive?\" The answer is very simple, some people like to pay this price to buy them. It is just a price.\n\nIf you need more explanation, I will tell you a little story:\n\n> A and B are two rich people walking in the park and suddenly find a pile of dog shit on the road. A says to B: \"You eat the dog shit, and I will pay you 50 million. \" B ate the dog shit and A paid already 50 million. After a while another pile of dog shit was found, B said to A: \"If you dare to eat it, I will also give you 50 million. \"A is heartbroken that 50 million, at the moment ate a clean. A B embraced each other and cried: \"Not a penny earned, but each one ate a pile of shit.\"\n\n## Referrals\n\n[https://iiiyu.com/2022/07/06/what-is-the-value-of-blockchain/](https://iiiyu.com/2022/07/06/what-is-the-value-of-blockchain/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1657164898, "digest": "-q6fTZgV-AhwU6Zokfm2GHLOYJ4RE93X437wXljZZTM", "contributor": "0xB98d657f554f7258C0Ab0d4280B9024Fb7eE8b12"}

"“颜渊问仁。子曰：‘克己复礼为仁。一日克己复礼，天下归仁焉。为仁由己，而由人乎哉？’”（《论语》）\n\n \n\n“我们应当聆听的伟大思想绝不仅限于西方。但要聆听印度和中国的伟大思想，就必须懂得他们的语言，而我们又无法学习所有的语言，这是我们的不幸！”（施特劳斯《何为自由教育》）\n\n无论我们如何去解读孔子，孔子都在“那儿”，无论我们如何去高山仰止孔子，我们仍然无法“仰止”。好古从来不是一种对于未经历过的时代向往有“恶”趣，无论我们如何景仰一些辉煌时代，还是对当世之境更加的留恋，好古更像是源于我们对当下的困惑。而这种“惑”可能在过去的每一代，他们的当时之境也一样面临。即便我们与哲人同生活于同一时空之中，由于信息与心智的不对等，我们也仍然无法去从哲人那儿得到教诲。囿于现实的原因：哲人无法脱离于他生活的环境而独立存在，为了让生命更多的维系以完成最重要的事，哲人退而求其认为最重要的事，哲人的眼光更多着眼于未来的数代。甚至是在有意无意之中，哲人影响的不止是一个民族的数代，更可能是很多民族的数代，更甚的是一个人类世界的某些运行的必然法则由哲人的顿悟而来。但哲人首先也缘于他对他的时代的深刻了解，在再三平衡中选择一种处理最重要事务的路径。哲人超越了他要在当世获取最大承认的抱负，哲人也不冀望于未来会对他有更大的承认。哲人清楚如果他们把所握对于最重要的事物的判断的话，那未来他的名字将会一次次被提及。哲人的探究的目的还不在于此，这只是他伟大探究的附加之物或看不见的神祇给哲人孤寂的人生的最大的奖赏。许多重大的疑惑即便过了几十代，仍然没有最至理的最佳答案，哲人也无从下手，但仅凭发现最重要的问题这一点，哲人俨然无可否认地就是哲人。\n\n越是重大的问题，越发显得问题与回答简洁；越是重大的问题，问比答显得更加重要。由于有些问题即便绵延数千年，也无法有一个让人感觉接近其真本的答案。最早提出问题的人，也一定是代表了更多的人莫名的巨大困惑，更何况有些问题是每个人都在内心一辈子都在打个问号，寻求得到解答。两个哲人之间的对话，从某种意义上看，更像是思想交锋。而面对重大问题的对话，常常产生在哲人与那些对重大问题有无尽的困惑的次哲人之间，亦或是老师与学生之间。甚至是，有些重要的问题，提出问题的人，虽然没有答案，但某种意义上，其内心的思索和探究，也在某种意上比那些提出答案的人更加的深入。\n\n有些学生是注定可能未来是一定会在某些智识上超越他的老师的。颜渊是那个在心智上最接近作为哲人孔子的心境的。作为哲人的孔子，是不是已察审到颜渊未来必将在智识上超越于他？甚至在颜渊还是一位初入门下的学生时，其“一箪食，一瓢饮，在陋巷，人不堪其忧，回也不改其乐”的特质，也预示着某些孔子自叹无法达其心境的自歉。\n\n在《论语》里，有一个字，显得是那么的重要而又难以触及，从孔子起，后延两千多年，多少学者穷其一心，也力图接近孔子所要最终表达的，遗憾的是，针对不同的人，孔子的回答不尽一致，甚至有些提出问题者，孔子的回答看似平淡无奇。这个问题就是：什么是“仁”？\n\n孔子的多个学生都向孔子请教过什么是仁。孔子可能也不清楚真正的仁是什么，可孔子一定知道对于不同心性的人来说，对仁的恰当的内部阐释对提出什么是仁的人来说，一定意味着什么。孔子采取了一种因材施教的教学法，针对独立的个体，以及学生的修为、个性等，回复关于仁的意义，显得其释义更像是针对那个提问者的修身而量身定做一般。同一个问题，有如此多的答案，那一定意味着孔子在针对提出问题的人而因人而答。哲人谨慎对待在属人的问题上，对于不同的个体，其答案是不尽相同，这意味着哲人承认一个重要的事实：即质料上的不一样性的必然存在。质料也难以同一存在。哲人之所以要采取这样一种费力不讨好的做法，可能缘于哲人对个体有极大的尊重，同时，哲人清楚，谈话的对象一旦有问题，将意味着不光施教成了一种折磨，甚至会带来不必要的麻烦，这种麻烦有些会把哲人的生命给耗尽。但由于人生的不可琢磨性，在什么样的时间，什么样的地点，遇上什么样的质料，哲人亦如其他人一样，他也无法控制这些冥冥中的天意所在。纵然哲人可以花一定的时间，去做适当的甄别，对于短暂的生命而言，也有可能就是哲人活于世间的一种必然性宿命。哲人最大的不同之处还是会反求诸己，其实每个人都在反求诸己：尽最大可能直面内心的各种横冲直撞。\n\n仁，从最早的象形文字上看，我们能看到，更像是一个人在前面赶马车，后面的两横，上横是人坐在车上，下横是马车主要构成。其承担莫大的责任，而作为赶车的人，最重要的是平安对马进行驾驭，把人送到他要去的地方。各种机缘凑巧，总是有人会坐在赶车的位置，车上的人的性命和能否能安全到达他所要去的终点，在一切外在环境没有意外的情况下，就取决于相信赶车的人。而在行进的过程中，不可能不存在外在的各种状况，如天气恶劣，刮风下雨，与其他马车之间的冲撞进等等，有些情况是赶车的人能轻松应对，有些是他无法应对的。但即便面临如果命运非要让人处于无法应对的环境下，我们唯一能做的还是在于反求诸己。在孔子的学生中，有一位，是孔子在他面前也自叹无法在某些控制上超越于他，仁更像是一种行动准则。从某种意义上看，仁更像是一种行动，正因是不断变化的行动状态，可能一个人在仁行时，未必意识到他的行为是真正的仁。而旁观者却看出其间的意义所在。颜回就是那位在行中最接近孔子认为的最高的仁的那一位。一位老师打心里赞美自己的学生，无论是当面还是与他人的交谈中，以及在其他的学生面前，无疑是对一个学生最大的认同。孔子一定看到了什么重要的东西，而这种东西是身为老师的自己也无法企及的。即便是无法企及，光凭识人，孔子已经是超越了很多哲人。所以，在孔子所有的学生问仁中，颜回的问仁，孔子的回答，更像是一种关于仁的最高的行为的语言上的总结。\n\n孔子回答颜渊的问仁，首先更像是孔子对颜渊的赞美，而不是孔子对颜渊的教诲，也就是说，通过颜渊的行，孔子得到了关于什么是“仁”的最触达根基的顿悟。\n\n我们不禁要问：颜回究竟在行上有何重大的与其他同门不一样的地方，以至于能获得孔子最高的肯定？更重要的是，孔子从颜回行中在理论的总结上受益良多。孔子的其他的学生中，若干在辅佐君主治理国家方面，都取得了相当了不起的成就。颜回一生没有从事过任何官职。也没有留下的著作，只有在论语中的只言片语，却不光是得到了孔子最高的肯定，甚至是同门师兄弟中，那些取得巨大成就的师弟如子贡、曾长，都对颜回钦佩有加。如果颜回的行动本身诠释了对于反观自身什么是最好的仁，那对于有志于试图去探究社会运行的本质的孔子来说，只是事物运行的一面，即对自身要求的一面，这一面尽管也很难。一个人不断去求学，究竟是为了什么？是他对学问本身就天生的痴迷？还是要通过增长自身的技能，应用于其他场境中，以求得名，以求得利，或者名利双收？在孔子的学生中，有众多的跟随在孔子身边，从老师那学到技能去攻城拔寨之人，看似取得了成就，却助一国去取另一国之人的性命。如果孔子满足于教出更多的以战胜他人为乐的出类拔萃的人，孔子就不是我们看到的万世师表的孔子了。\n\n可以说，从修身的角度看，颜回已达到了一种最高的标准，这种标准既不冀望获取他人的赞美，也不会把自己置于一种某种一定要通过什么手段过上舒适生活的刻意追求，而是一种随遇而安，不刻意追求口腹之欲，也不肆意影响他人的言行。一切只从自身去探究。一生只是在智识上不断去接近本真，于某些时候或更多时候对自身肉身的关照，只要不影响其正常的探究，食得以饱腹，可能就相当满足的状态。作为我们普通的人来说，更多的是一种人间烟火的生活，或许一生为一个家庭的几口人过上锦衣玉食的生活即是人生最大的追求，可能这种追求很多人穷其一生也难以达致，对于我们大多数人来说，可能是遗憾的人生，但也是无可奈何之事。\n\n即便是某些力所能及之事，作为个体的我们做不到，却会有意无意，潜意识也好，下意识也罢，要求我们之外的环境和人去为我们做到。甚至当这欲望没有得到满足时，我们会莫名生气，或悲叹命运之不公，社会之不公，他人之不是，但从不把不满加诸我们自身。更进一步的是，有些人打着铲除不公之名，推行自身的意志，结果常常是，旧的不公非但没有消除，新的更多的不公随之而来产生。而人要承认自己的失误之举很难，我们的经验常常与我们的行动不在同时，或是理论先于行动，却指导出了最坏的行动，或者是行动先于理论，但又造成了巨大的伤害，即使事后弥补，伤害已是既成事实。更多的是，当值此窘境，我们更多的认为是我们之外的原因。\n\n颜回就是那位在自身的修为上“反求诸己”最好的践行者。可以说，由于我们承认对于至亲之人有义不容辞的责任时，反求诸己是很难的一件事，因为独立个体自身的舒适，并不意味着这种尺度也适用于我们在乎的人，尽管我们在乎某些人其实最终的目的还是为了我们自身的舒适感而服务。所以，要么我们选择一种折衷的做法：尽最大的可能创造一种环境，去适应我们在乎的人所向往的环境。 我们很多的人就是这样的一种人，这种占大数的群体的努力，无形中反而成为一个社会在物质方面，甚至是文化方面，不断往前创造丰富性的最大的动力之源了。所以，更多时候，为我们所在乎的具像化的个体所向往的世俗的生活，成了一个社会不断繁荣的基础。我们一生在乎于最在乎的人对我们自身的承认，我们绝大多数的人，很难走出这个谜圈，甚至作为哲人的孔子，也常常困惑于此。最“可怕”的是，我们对这种追求乐此不疲，穷其一生，仍怨无悔，还可能引以为傲。当如颜回一般“只要饿不死，吃什么都无所谓”、“只要冻不死，睡哪儿都一样“、“只要接近事物运行的最佳之道，一路身心上的苦难好像都是一种美好”这样的人出现，我们不由得发出莫名的惊叹，因为可能百万人中，可能只有一个这样的人，甚至是数代人中，能出现这样一个人亦相当了不起。如果一个人在生活中遇到这样的人，纵是一种幸事，也因由于世俗的追求太过强大，也会把这种人归于一种只知自身观照自身的另类。即便翻烂整部《论语》，在孔子所有的学生中，加上孔子，也难做到像颜回这样的行。亦如和孔子一样了不起的作为哲人的司马迁，也难以达到颜回的境界。当我们去读司马迁写给好友任安的书信时，感受到一生以“通古今之变，成一家之言“为志业的司马迁，和我们的追求，是有更大的相像。\n\n可以说，自古而今颜回是一种神奇的存在：为我们所景仰，我们却穷其一生很难达致其境界。颜回的行从旁观者的角度看，没有什么深奥之处，也就是说，不需要极其高深的或某些极具天赋的技能，只要去行，都可看似可复刻颜回的行。看似最简单的行，却是天底下最难的行。也就是说，无论是处于何种处境的人，其内心深处都有寄望于他人为我们某一个具像或不具像的欲望服务的需求。这也注定了我们离不开彼此，或者说不是由我们刻意为之，却是一种既得之势去要求他人。我们可以孔子为表率，但我们无法以颜回为表率，甚至颜回的行，超越了所有宗教教派缔造者的行。因颜回看似无门槛的行却是世间门槛最高的行，我们无法成为颜回的信徒，我们从颜回那儿真正体验到人生最大的悲伤：真正的知易行难。\n\n当一个老师遇到这样的学生，如果不从年龄的角度看，不知道谁是“老师“，谁是“学生”。当一个哲人遇到这样一个能行哲人所不能行的学生，哲人的哲就更进一步了：哲人就这样幸运地可以成为更多哲人们的老师了。从颜回这种超然于所有人的存在看，孔子就是这样一位“幸运”的哲人。\n\n孔子亲自下场，向他的朋友和学生甚至是君王解释颜回的超凡之处。以下这段孔子与子贡的对话，既表明了子贡自认在了解老师学识的天资上与颜回比，逊色不少。同时，连作为老师的孔子，在事物的认知的更进一步上，也自叹不如颜回。\n\n“子谓子贡曰：‘女与回也孰愈？’对曰：‘赐与何敢望回？回也闻一以知十，赐也闻一以知二。’子曰：‘弗如也。吾与女弗如也。’”\n\n如果不是对事物本质有恰当的把握，一个人又怎会如此的通透呢？若非要更进一步的话，我们需要了解这对话里的“闻一以知十”是指哪方面的闻，是治国？齐家？外交？个人修为？待人接物？还是其他？似乎我们不得而知，但通篇看《论语》的话，似乎孔子教育学生的主题很广。如果非要仔细去探究的话， 我们只能这要假设：在每一个有颜回在场的孔子的谈话主题里，绝大多数的主题颜回都能做得到“闻一以知十”，如果不是绝大多数，恐怕颜回得不到子贡与孔子这样一致的心悦诚服的评价。能在孔子的主题教育里做到“闻一以知十”，其在才智上，可以说，不知道要把多少人比下去。如果我们在生活中遇到这样的人，那真是三生有幸。悲伤的还是，有可能我们身边就有这样的人，但缘于各种机运，我们无法结识这样的人。因为从开始，我们在智识上，就和这样的人不在一条线上，甚至是由于我们的愚昧，我们可能无法辨识。这是我们一生的不幸。这样有超越同门才智的颜回，却对获取巨大财富没有兴趣，即对利用自己非凡的才智去为诸侯服务换得物质上的极大丰富无动于衷。在孔子公开的问学生的志向时，颜回的抱负是“愿无伐善，无施劳”。在颜回去世后，鲁国的君王鲁哀公问及孔子其学生中最欣赏谁，孔子的回答也是颜回，并给以了一个似乎只有非常人之人才能抵达的境界的评价：“不迁怒，不贰过”。对于我们每个普通人来说，仅仅是不迁怒都恐怕百万人中估计才有廖廖几人做得到，更何况要做到“不贰过”。即如我们去研读各种宗教的经典，都深有体会各开山祖师们的你要如何如何的言论，也就是说，即便如佛祖如上帝如希腊神话里的宙斯本人，也是会发脾气的人，而且脾气大得很，他们可以于最大的善许下不知道能不能实现的最大的恩惠，也会对他们认为最大的恶诅咒最大的惩罚。如果施以善意，我们可能会说，佛祖与上帝均不会发怒，而是写下他们的言行的人胡乱杜撰。但什么样的人有如此的胆量，敢于去杜撰神的言行？他不就怕神对他施以最大的惩罚？所以，如果要从逻辑上讲得通的话，我们姑且也只能相信神本身也是有脾气的。孔子在面对有些资质鲁钝的学生或一些投取巧的学生，仍忍不住要勃然大怒，斥责他们的不当之举。孔子是一位有脾气的哲人，这是作为一位老师对于学生的责任之举。承认在理解事物是如何恰当运行的这件事上，资质的不同，其理解千差万别。甚至有些人，由于其生活的背景知识大家相去甚远，是无法进行恰当的理解的。\n\n过正义的生活可能意味着淡泊的生活，这对于我们这个时刻准备享受一切可享受的普通之人来说，是不可忍受的。人本质上是不正义的，我们时时刻刻修正自己是因为在现实的生活中，我们不克制自身的不正义的一面，可能我们的生活会朝向我们无法控制的方向前行，特别是当不正义对他人之利益造成了伤害，也就注定了我们将会麻烦缠身。所以明智的普通人们会在恰当的他可承受的范围内，努力地让因他之故的事物朝向正义的一面发展，这些许的努力所产生的微光，聚集起来，人类社会就这样一点一滴朝向一种更加适宜于更多的人生存的方向发展。\n\n关于颜回的壮年去世，也许真应验了海德格尔的那句话：“知识远不如必然性有力量。”命运不可琢磨，命运对于个体的人生轨迹而言，似乎永远占有优势之位。在关于事物的知识中，我们都无可奈何地要听任命运的吹来打去，而且我们的关于事物的知识在命运面前无能为力。1933年曾经迷失的海德格尔，也用他的经历深深应证了他所提及的必然性的力量。\n\n有一点，孔子曾经说过颜回对于他没有帮助，因为颜回对于孔子说的话，没有不欢喜的。若真如此，又何来子贡说颜“闻一以知十”呢？是颜回在和子贡的对谈中谈到对老师孔子授业的理解？还是在众多面人的传道中孔子让大家发表自己的心得感受颜回阐述最多？最大的可能是：孔子认为颜回对他没有帮助，是指其言论上的帮助，但颜回已用自身的行，让孔子产生了更多的言。孔子关于颜回问仁的回答，更多的是颜回用其行诠释了什么才是真正的仁。而残酷的事实是，无论对于孔子，对于古代，对于如今的我们，这个因颜回而生出的仁，我们太难去身体力行了，它成了一个标杆中的杆杆，我们只能安慰自己：念念不忘，必有回响。至于要去付诸现实，则可能只有颜回再世。\n\n既然标准是如之高，对于咱们这些占绝大数的普通人来说，探究他的意义何在？甚至是那些通透人生的哲人，也未必能在行上有颜回有如此的为。本着现实生活的“知易行难”，我们何不放手一知，明知我们由于资质鲁钝无法去行，但充分去知若有此种希望，我们可以试着一试去探索一下，以期对校正我们的浑浑噩噩的生活有些许的触动。\n\n恰当地控制我们的言与行是如此的难。要了解为何我们不能“克己”，是缘于我们在营造各自所理解的幸福生活时，我们对外有所求，这种求可能意味着我们要去发声，这种发声并不一定对他人真正有利，也可能在某些时候，对自己都不利。有时我们自以为更接近本真的发声，由于选择的发声对象的不对等性，带来的反而是深深的误解。有些巨大的仇恨，常常是由于我们不能控制自己的言行所致。言辞所导致的仇恨有时比真正的伤害更来得让自认为受双伤害者更加的歇斯底里。作为独立的个体，我们是无法自足的，也就是说，我们可以给自己定价，但并不意味着就有人买单。如果世界只有一个人存在，则可能他所有的努力除了维持自身活着以外，其他都毫无意义。\n\n对于人作为人，有没有与生以来，上天赋予的某些自然权利，人们所采取的态度是，更多是默认。而胆大者干脆视人没有天赋权利，把一切人间的人的权利，均视作是处于上者对下者的恩赐。\n\n人们是如此的不喜欢机运，因很多时候人生的富足不是你投入了最多的时间上的努力和最大的智力上的付出就可获得。可无时无刻人们都希翼最好的机运，人会去做各种努力和探索，以求最好的机运能降临自身。而探索中，难免动作会因此走形，于是各种变量得以产生。\n\n“克己”预设了我们已做出价值判断。如果人不作价值判断，则无法前行。无论从哪个层面上去定义小人与大人，好人与坏人，恶人与善人，他们在生活中都已对前行做了价值判断，尽管有些判断与行为之间不一致。价值判断的不一致的必然存在，导致我们无法解决价值冲突。所谓的价值中立也是基于一种价值判断的基础上做出的悬搁。做出价值判断并不一定就会让我们在行动中不走弯路，只要在行走中，必然会有弯路。价值冲突中人类理性无法解决，最后催生的可能是两种或多种的解决方案，要么采取强力，要么采取智慧的措施去解决价值冲突。要么是经沟通后的悬搁。让各种存在混杂一起，然后看看他们互相之间能产生什么样的影响。但这种解决方式，是那些其实没有做价值判断，或他的判断本身而是缘于自身现有利益最大化的保存，希望未来不受任何外来因素的影响而失去的现有权力的掌握者所不愿意去进行的。这就是我们的现实生活最悲伤的事实。\n\n从人类的理性解决不了价值冲突的角度看，克已是天底下第一难事，却也是我们为了在我们有限生命中尽最大可能尊重其他生命的情况下所做的最智慧的选择。尽管这种选择在于人们看来其实无法把他们的财富最大化，或者堵死了他们财富最大化的路。因而克己与天启有着本质上的冲突。如果我们承认天启是可能的，则意味着，我们作为人的智慧其实根本不是什么智慧，或者人有无智慧无足轻重，只需要按照神的意志来行事即可得到所谓的幸福生活。然而，神作为明明可以独立自主的，他为何要求凡人事事按他的要求去办？难道他不能运用他的原力，在每个人在在细胞酝酿时把他最大的正确性或者他倡导的正义的原力注入到这些凡人的体内吗？这样就免除了后天天天苦口婆心的规劝？\n\n尽管人本身的血肉之躯，但由于各种机运借力，某些人常常会到最高处，最高处的最高者在理想社会的状态下，会被人们寄与衡平者的期望。可人作为人，无论经过多少最精妙的训练，仍然是一个活人，无论如何的神化和非神化，仍是人之为人，这是无可奈何之事。处于衡平者的位置，不一定就能恰如其分的衡平，甚至由于身份的转换，常常会做出更多的非衡平的决策与行动。如果没有一种行动的政治哲学基础，则可能最大的有为会给他当世的社会带来最大的伤害，甚至这种伤害绵延数代乃至数十代。\n\n既要承认既然之势，同时有没有一种最高的政治哲学基础作为根基之根基，让衡平者尽最大的可能不做出可能造成最大的伤害的选择和伤害，历来是哲人们毕生的追求。作为衡平者，在理性与合理之间的选择，将会成为衡平者最勉为其难的工作。有些行动是理性的，但非合理的；有些行动则是合理的，但并非理性的；也有一些行动是既合理的，又是理性的。行动的合理与否，理性与否，对于衡平或被衡平来说，都是难事，因而有没有可能存在一种重叠共识作为基础，然而事实就是，囿于我们最后还是要选择，而不选择本身也是一种选择，社会最终还是要极力寻求自身的重叠共识。\n\n哲人希望自个儿呆着，但哲人如果不面对如施特劳斯所说的屈从于解决之道的诱惑的这一最大的危险，那哲人的所有思考将是一场笑话。这一无可避免的冲突是哲人所无法回避的。而正由于这一危险的始终存在，哲人把眼光放到更远的未来。而对于当下，哲人力图抵制聚光灯下的诱惑，要么用纸和笔，要么用小群体的研讨。真正的哲人避免对所有一视同仁的谈话，即便是付诸文字，真正哲人也会把他最真实的意图隐藏在字里行间，但也正因这种隐微式的表达，造成了不同背景和教育水平的人，读出来的东西不一样，这种分歧也表明了现实生活中人们的观念冲突之不可避免。\n\n哲人一生探求何为最好的，但如果哲人已经笃定了何为最好的，那哲人便不是哲人了。哲人有一点是清楚的，世间的纷争多数在于世人急于把自己笃定的观念让他人也依此而行。而哲人正因对形势的复杂而无法确切去向他人确认自身的观念，所以哲人更多会尊重多元性。这也意味着哲人把他所有的人当作一个个有独立人格的人：尽管哲人也可能会有极其烦燥之时，但哲人不会去把对方视作一个不可沟通的个体而采取强力的措施。\n\n要充分理解克己为最高的政治哲学基础，我们需要去面对这样的一个事实：由于前进的需要，总有人会站在最高处，无论他胜任或不胜任。总会因各种机运神奇地站在最高处。而同样的事实便是，总有某个哲人或每一个时代会有潜在的哲人对于这一事实的了然。哲人也明白了即便他比他时代的所有人都接近一个了解整全，他仍然无法把这个整全向所有人去施惠，甚至这种施惠反而会给哲人带来极大的麻烦：由于哲人已站在了解整全的最高处，他无法要求所有人和他一样站在最高，因为可能这种施惠反而成了施恶。这一无可奈何的事实也成了哲人苏格拉底的宿命，也成为了孔子自嘲的无奈感。这就意味着，纵然知道何为最好，哲人也无法或也不该去向一个特定的社会去强行施加这种好的影响。因哲人自身无法突破一点：哲人做不到为了贯彻一个他以为是善的思想而冒可能引起混乱的险，更甚的是，有可能由于这种一以贯之还会让一些人的生命被牺牲。但哲人还是要到市场上去，他通过极大的耐心，让所有心性不一的人们，逐步会走向一个重叠共识。这一过程甚至需要数千年，也甚至可能在中途遇到某些野蛮的事件的影响，最后这个影响甚至以化为无形的彻底的烟消云散。这对于人生不过百年的人们来说，哲人的这一选择完全可以在他们实实在在的生活中可以忽略。因为日常的生活已经让我们应接不暇，我们绝无可能把目光放在千年之外。但无论如何，人类世界中，总是有屈指可数的人，他们确确实实把目光放到了千年之外，这既是无可奈何的先择，更是一种负责任的选择。因为一个问题在过去的数百年即便有最好的解决方案也无法付诸实践，那未来的数百年，可能也面临同样的困境。即便在现实的生活中，哲人尽管窥探到某些整全，但哲人亦无法断然认为这就是真正的整全，哲人不是天生就是哲人，或许这些整全的探求是在各种情形使然的情况下冷静下来后的寻求出路的一种无心之发现。\n\n审慎与节制从来都是一等一的难事，有时候会和无所作为，无所事事，混吃等死掺杂在一起。但审慎与节制者从未停止他们思考的勤勉。尽管有可能肉身未动，大脑都在不停地转动。节制是于己出发的根基，而为了与他人共同生存于这个世界，我们唯一能做的就是保持与他者的理性沟通。这源于不言而喻的在现代社会单个的个体无法独立存在。而在探究这一重大共识的后面，孔子的所有言论的前提藏着一个看似没有讨论，实则已表明态度的基础：即当面对“绝对的不容异己”者，该持何种态度的问题？“不容异己者”有轻重之分，有因出身、教育等的不一而同产生的不同的对事物的看法。但政治哲学概念中的“绝对的不容异己者”，极大的可能就在于无法对话，或干脆关闭对话之门。只要任何人不关闭对话之门，他即绝非“绝对的不容异己者”。从最大的有可能影响更多的人来惠及自身的角度出发，“绝对的不容异自己”者即便对所有他者的意见一万个不赞同，他仍试图把己身之观念向所有的人灌输，只要一个人，或衡平者有如此的深愿，就有对话的可能性。无论是从哪一个角度看，这种试图对话的可能性始终存在。而这种可能性，成为了政治社会不断积累真共识的希望所在。纵然会在某些至暗时刻，会有一定的退一步或退几步，但只要人们存在试图影响他人的希冀，则若从数十年或数百年的角度看，仍是充满希望。而让人们真正无法忍受的是：若不从数百年的角度看，人的生命的百年之数，则可能成为了某些企图加快事物变化的衡平者由于采取断然之势而让事物朝着他所期望的反方向的发展。更大的可能不是“绝对的不容异己”的存在，而是生命如此的短暂的悲伤的事实。生命短促会让各方失去耐心，从而产生了诸如战争这类最极端的结果发生：在取他人性命的同时，自身也充满了各种变数。不过，最充满希望的是，即便人的耐性有限的情况下，人们也仍试图采取对话去达成共识。若不存在这一重大可能性，则人类社会一切文明以及衡平者的存在等，都将毫无意义可言。若我们不厘清“绝对的不容异己者”是否存在，则为仁的“复礼”就无法成为“克己”后的对话之匙了。当然，如果任何人自认掌握了真理，就可随意判断他人的行为和言行，并自以为是关闭对话的通道，即便碰到这样的情况，我们仍存对话的希望。对于最大勇气的最好的诠释：必须假定你的对话的对象是理性的。容忍我们生活的许多事情的答案悬而未决，是我们得以抱有共存至让生命自然消失而不是某些人力因素消失的希望。孔子的东方智慧里，蕴藏了两千多年以来人类社会最重大的希望：只要对话的大门不关闭，我们就有希望。或者说，对话的大门是不可能关闭的。即便因人之血肉之躯会意气用事，但也内心存续了不想让血腥一直持续在自己所生活的环境中。\n\n      关于节制（moderation），施特劳斯的著作里所提出的不止一处，在《现代性的三次浪潮》里，施特劳斯提到：“德性在本质上就是节制。” 在《社会科学与人文素养》一文中：“人文素养本身就是一处节制（moderate）的路数。”的《自由教育与责任》一文中：“节制将保护我们免于陷入两个相伴而生的危险，一个是对政治抱有幻想性期望，另一个是缺乏男子气地鄙视政治。” “所有受过自由教育的人都将是政治上节制的人。” 在“苏格拉底问题第三讲中：“节制本是苏格拉底的品质特征。”“苏格拉底认为，智慧与节制乃是密不可分的。”为何哲人们如此的对节制有如此的再三的提及？可能缘于一种哲人们对于人性本身的最深层次的判断：即无论一个人有最大的善意，所有人都有一个共存的基于个人主义的前提，尽管个人主义有高下之分，但并非最大善意的个人主义就能带来最好的的结果，有时甚至是更加糟糕的结果。因而承认我们无论尽最多大的努力，也达不到最理想的那个境地时，唯一的能让人们共存的可取之道就是先反求诸己。否则我们所有的美好的愿望都将会在影响他人前先烧毁的是自己。\n\n       施特劳斯曾直指修昔底德的《伯罗奔尼撒战争史》中，修昔底德揭开了一层悲伤的面纱：最高者脆弱之极。从某种共存的角度理解来看，而这种脆弱也可能缘于最高者拥有最大的他自认为是对所有人都有利的最大的善意，而要急于在一个社会中把这种善意以最快的速度覆盖下去。可现实的情况实在是太复杂了，整齐划一的美好实施反而成了一种善意得不到最佳体现。而在施特劳斯所有的著作里，贯穿着人类社会的一个比他所揭示的悲伤的面纱更悲伤的事实，施特劳斯更是毫无掩饰直陈己见：社会总是要对思想进行僭政的，迫害无处不在。为何要对思想僭政？ 为何迫害无处不在？同样可从释放最大善意的角度来看：由于人与人在智识、经历、出身、教育背景以及碰到的个体的影响等等上的复杂多样性，人们是很难就某些重大主题快速达成某些一致性时，已处于衡平者地位者而又要急于把他认为是最佳的处置方式施惠于所有人时，就会因这种步调一致的走过大桥造成了桥有可能会因为共振而桥会塌的危险。\n\n       那么问题来了：为何我们总是要把衡平者、知识分子、哲人等等这些隔离开来呢？是专业分工的思想造成了我们这样的隔裂？还是我们无法相信一个人不可能集所有的优点于一身？或者手握念珠无法让若无威慑人们会互相而食？承认人的局限性是何其的难。而如果不承认个体的局限性，则我们无法从整全的角度看待何为“复礼”。克制内心的种种悸动，让我们已经筋疲力尽，但这是没有办法的事。更没有办法的是：就是我们虽然是独立的个体，但若不到人群中去，我们便无法达到一些想要去的地方。“复礼”总味着，我们在乎我们的邻居的感受，也同时希望我的邻居某种意义上理解我的感受。一方面人作为人需要对自己之行为抱有极大的审慎，又同时为了我们于其间的生活能够裨益于他人需要做出必要的行动。但哪些行动必要，哪些行动无所谓，对于人来说，则无法准确判断之。如果说我们确实在如何恰当地控制自己的言与行方面，无法找到一种妥当的执行之道。那么，“复礼”则成了最为适合的方式：只要我们活着，就得到市场上去，哪怕被羞辱，被非难……都是必然的。这种必然的可能性在于我们生活中的冲突无处不在，尽管我们努力避免造成达不到目的的冲突。可只要我们活着，冲突俨然成为生活一个必要的组成部分。即便如孔子，且不说和诸侯的理念冲突，光每天面对一堆学生的“冲突”，都是足以让人精疲力尽的事。甚至有学生干出出格的事想甩锅，孔子也只能先以师者之名发怒震慑：“求，无乃尔是过与？”，然后再晓之以理。当面对陌生的第三者时，孔子的影响他人则更换了更为谦卑的方式。这里却暗合了马基雅维里的思考：人们本质上不大听从道德忠告。如果最大的衡平者就是这样一个人，那人们该如何是好呢？回到最本质的层面上来，如果命运给了一个环境可以最大程度地一劳永逸解决不需要衡平者听从道德忠告即可避免造成最大的伤害时，一定要抓住这不可多得的机会。但由于机运之神是如此的难以琢磨，则更大的可能性下我们穷其一生也看不到那样的希望所在时，我们唯一能做的，还只能是道德忠告，最大的可能的是，如果我们不想做那个不做任何思考的最大多数，我们也只能选择这条唯一的路。在几无希望的情况下，道德忠告成了唯一可能的希望，尽管希望渺茫。政治哲学一直在追问何为最好的，但现实情况却是，没有一个当代的衡平者不认为他所治下的当下是最好的。在追问何为最好的时候，必然与生活之现实产生某些必然的冲突，这种冲突在于哲人来看，是正常的。但哲人的对手一般不这样认为，哲人的对手会认为这是对自身的一种挑战。而这种挑战对于哲人来说，则成了一种不必要的宿命，因为根基不一样，所以对话的立足点一开始哲人就败下阵来。哲人没有办法，他只能采取迂回之方法，甚至，哲人意识到由于何为最好的，有可能需要数百年的时间去消化。哲人把眼光放得更加长远，他甚至是要在有限的余生里只对数百年后的一些个体说话，他放弃了对当世的影响。孔子无疑是这样一位漩涡式的哲人。可是，由于哲人不可脱离当下的环境而独立存在，哪怕是深深的失望，亦得充满希望。哲人采取了一种积极入世的办法，他们最好的办法是放弃对等对话的奢望，取而代之一种适用性，即充分考虑到衡平者们的各种秉性，只说对他们的行若他们想够一够就能够到的言。不对衡平者的位置发起挑战，只抓住衡平者希望能得到绝大多数人的承认的这一心理。因为如果一个衡平者傲娇到不需要绝大多数人的承认的时候，这衡平者是把自己置于最危险的境地，这种情况下的衡平者少之又少。更多情况下衡平者自认为他所采取的种种政策是有益于绝大多数人的。但其实在哲人看来，因人与人的各种出身、教育、生活背景、社会交往，后天习得等等的不说相同，人们的需求哪怕在某个细微的地方的整齐划一，亦难达到一种最佳的存在，由此历史一次次在验证哲人们最初的担忧：最大的善往往可能产生最大的恶。\n\n       有一个问题，我们如果回避，则我们等于是放弃了严肃对待我们所面临的重大主题，从而会把我们的工作变成一种彻头彻尾的游戏：哲人也是不完美的人，哲人也有脾气。乃至有些哲人也不讲卫生，有些哲人还好喝两口。但哲人的哲不在于他是一个完人，而是他始终保持追问何为最好的。一旦哲人放弃追问何为最好的，哲人就不再是哲人。在何为最好的这个问题上，哲人本身也没有答案。可哲人不同于常人的地方在于，哲人有追问的勇气，而且这种追问他不会去盲目要求在他生活的当世得到验证。由于哲人无法去赞美当世之伟岸，因为当世如果伟岸，则衡平者不会去压制那些不赞美他的人，或者衡平者不会去渴求当下立显。只要存在着压制，则肯定当世就不是伟岸的。这就意味着鼓吹当世之伟岸者，我们从与人为善的角度看，他是当世之受益者，或者另一种，则是出于保护自身的利益的恐惧而表现出的行为，尽管这种行为也可能是一种油然而生的表现。一方面冲突的无法调和，另一方面哲人不是完人，哲人若要继续保持他追问的处境，哲人需要面对现实之环境的需要，这就注定了即便我们与真正哲人生活在同一时空，由于哲人的伪装，我们如果没有通过哲人留下的作品，我们无法去意识到有哲人存在。因而，哲人无疑多数只会影响到和他们不在同一时代的人。“复礼”无疑是哲人的伪装，哲人没有想到的是，他的伪装，却成了我们普通人赖以生存的路径。同样，为了找到出路，衡平者无论有多少绝对的权力，为了无论从表面还是深层，他信之为信，为了他坐稳衡平位置着想之计，“复礼”不失为一种必然的策略。有时候，可能是在多数时候，表面的策略却是必然的选择。所有的这些，并不意味着我们对衡平者有无上的苛求。规则的设计已表明，任何占在衡平者位置的人，他都得承受之重。可人往往是避重就轻的存在，有些烧脑的东西，即便处于衡平的位置，也宁愿搁置，采取一种他之认为现实有效而且结果立显的行动。但事物的矛盾之处在于，越是结果立显的行动，反而会从长期来看，可能造成的伤害是需要全体存在来承担。从吃喝拉撒的角度看，哲人也是常人，哲人的非同常人，缘于他在我们看似是根基的地方，却感受到了是一片沙地；在看似短期有益的地方，却看到了长期伤害。\n\n       如果环境是一片祥和之境，则就无所谓哲人不哲人。可由于祥和之境可能只是相对的，甚至是可遇不可求的，从万物平衡的角度看，必然有极少数的一类人他们的知识超越了当代的大多数人，也可以说有极少的人清醒地认识到可能当世之行动赖以存在的基础存在着足以把事物朝着反向发展的危险的质疑。哲人通常面临的状态是：不但没有表达的自由，甚至是没有不表达的自由。哲人亦不会因存在种种限制而从此不哼一声，哲人总有办法要表达他想要表达的，因哲人一开始就清楚，他的表达只是对那些在某些情况下心性有感受的人而言。所以哲人不会选择触怒那些没有相关教育或人生背景的人面前，用一种不明智的语言去向他们说话。直面迫害的可能性，是哲人一生中所有隐微表达的深因， 这种迫害并非全部来自于手握重器者，另一种就是当哲人对一个对如此重大问题毫无感觉的群体要一视同仁去追问时，无疑是在自取其辱。\n\n       孔子的路径，是一种从几无希望中寻找希望的路径：不再对谈话的对象及接触到的形形色色的个体，采取在智识上视作理所当然的“对等”的对话。对于熟悉的那些在智识上不在同一个维度上的，孔子根据其秉性施加对其有所裨益的言辞。而对于那些陌生的谈话对象，孔子更多的是以最谦卑的姿态去接触他们。孔子成了东方世界里最令人不解的现象，成为贡献给人类历史上来自东方世界的转折点和漩涡。而追问其实是把他谈话的对象当作是他的因之存在而存在的对象，作为哲人的孔子，不是要去颠覆他所生存的环境，他的目的是改善，改善蕴含一种温良的根基，既意味把所有的人当人看，又为了前行意味着对既得之势的承认。同时为了人们的共存，所有的行为都不能走到极端处。如果更进一步来看，甚至孔子的哲学是一种为权力着想的哲学。为何要为权力着想？因为权力的任性对于普通人的伤害是无法弥补的，但这种伤害在最极端的情况下是双向的，甚至埋下了处于高处的一方的基础越来越被其滥行权力而自己把自己掏空，从而在某些条件得到发酵的情况下形势出现了反转。当处于低处的一方拥有这种反转之势后，其所行事的风格可能比曾处于最高的一方更加的不堪。可一个悲伤的现实是：即便如此悲天悯人的温良，在于那些争于必变其自身命运而宁可牺牲他人性命的野心家面前，孔子就像一道墙一样，要为逾越找到借口，就必须把孔子打翻在地。每当处于一个转换的时期，孔子既是一种警醒，同时也是一种不怒而威的存在。尽管他由于人们互相撕咬的需要可能一时并扔在一边。可每每当尖埃落定时，人们又重新拾起孔子。这是没有办法的事：唯有孔子之路径，方能制造共识让可能在智识上无法达成相向性的人们，可以不互相把对方给撕了。孔子一生的目的，是努力防止处于这种相对对立的双方走到最极端处，从孔子了解的历史上，他清楚地知晓一旦到最极端处，最惨绝人寰的悲剧会有可能发生，族群的文明又将经历一次断层，即便是冲突的胜利者肉身还在，断层仍可能需要短则几十年，长则数百年的修复。孔子的温良深深奠基在他的一种无法驳倒的坚信：人类只有互相对话，互相感同身受，互相聆听彼此，互相扶持，才有可能经历一些虽处于宇宙中，却来自于外部非人类的不加辨识的一视同仁的毁灭。这种施以最大耐心的温良，却是东方历史上最大的勇敢的起源，是东方文明得以不断完善的根基。他一方面正因正视人之经验与人之生活的时间路径的不一致性，无视无论是当下还是未来人心的凶险，或者对话对象的无可理喻，也要把这种追问进行下去。",

胡子观币**：胡子观币的OG，也是AvatarDAO的MOD。21年初进币圈，之前有9年的A股交易经验，擅长领域是NFT和二级交易市场。\n\n**j.eth**：NFT爱好者，DegenToonz持有人，该项目被盗次数相对较多，与大家分享经历和应对措施。\n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥**：DegenToonz中文社区管理人，本身是一名程序员，进入币圈5年左右，现在更多精力在于找寻优质的NFT项目。\n\n**话题一：在钱包和NFT交易平台使用中，有哪些NFT的安全常识？**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang**：有个朋友曾想把他的一个NFT转走，不断的往钱包里面冲gas费，然后黑客就不断的转走，这黑客应该是写了一个监控工具加一个机器人。往钱包里冲多少，他就能转出多少，所以他就一直没办法把NFT转出来。我们自己是之前在韩国女友还有杀手女友比较火的时候买了不少，结果被一个钓鱼网站骗了。我们没有在官方的discord里面，然后有人私信我们，他就说可以低价买。因为之前也没有这种经验，所以就点进去了。点完了之后，他是要求你钱包去签名去授权，然后没有仔细看就点确定了，他就得到这个所有的NFT的，一个授权、签名，所以这个NFT就全部被转走了。那这个是平台，一定要在正规的交易平台，比如说opensea，looks这些，然后你要去识别平台的域名等，看这个平台是不是一个正规的平台，或者是不是官方的mint界面，一般这种官方mint界面，他都会写在项目方的Twitter主页或者discord他会专门开一个频道。关于这个钱包来说呢？其实就是对于用户自己来讲，就是要把这个私钥保存好。不能把私钥写在一些云笔记或者云盘上面，这个是非常危险的。因为一旦这种中心化的云笔记产品或者云盘，他们的这个服务器有漏洞或者安全威胁的话，那你这个私钥有黑客拿工具去扫满足这个私钥格式的内容。然后他一般脱完库之后，比如说云笔记的数据库被脱了之后呢，黑客就直接在这个被拖的这个数据库里面去寻找对应格式的私钥，然后他会去批量做一个转账处理。所以这个时候不能把这个私钥放在云盘上面，或者放在云笔记上面，建议的话就是最好私钥自己用纸写下来，或者自己用冷钱包管理自己的主账号，去玩NFT或者去打土狗的时候，用一些小号，这就是我个人的一个经验，一个防范的措施。\n\n**Piaoxue.eth|胡子观币**：补充几点我自己的一些习惯，我的每个钱包都会控制一下，就比方说NFT，有些单个也比较贵，那基本就贵的那些，每一个钱包就放这个NFT，然后别的什么也不放，我还有时候隔一段时间会把这个钱包里的全都转到一个新钱包，就因为之前有一些授权，可能自己点了也就忘记了，你要是去取消我不太会操作，我就直接去建一个新的，把它转过去。然后第2个就是不要随便点那些链接，很多都会给空投吗？我自己是从来不点，也不会领。然后discord，私信也都不会看的，总体就是减少这个风险暴露。平台我自己只用opensea、looks和X2Y2这3个，别的都没有用过。私钥，刚才老师说的这个私钥不要放在云盘上，然后我实际就放在云盘上，但我是把那个私钥的首尾2个地方颠倒过来了，就是那个字母跟数字颠倒过来，这样相当于如果是他拿到了也不一定能看得明白，或者说他直接复制也用不了。还有一个就是我自己一直想了解，但是我自己没用过，就是定期清理授权这个。我不知道有没有哪个老师能帮我讲一下，因为我之前看到过别人也是建议，定期就给钱包把授权都取消一遍。如果这个有谁知道，也教教我。\n\n**WaTell**：他这个东西其实挺简单的，因为我们现在购买NFT一般都是用这个MateMask小狐狸钱包，浏览器上会有一个MetaMask的这个插件，我们点开这个插件之后，他这个页面上在你的名字或者说在你的那个域名那一行其实有一个3个小点，就竖着的小点，然后你点开之后它有四项最下边是一项就是这个已连接的网站。然后她一点开之后就能看到你用这个钱包连接过哪些网站连接过哪些域名，你把你那些不想继续连接的这些网站取消掉，就点那个断开就可以了。这个东西其实还挺简单的，然后也挺安全的。我一般每次交互完一个网站，或者说mint完一个之后，就会把这个网站的连接给断开。\n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥**：我可以补充一点就是，你要清除授权的话，你也可以以太坊浏览器上面。它上面有一个标题栏，有一个就是token approve，你就可以从那里看到你当前连接的钱包有哪些授权你也可以从那里清除授权。钱包，我现在用的钱包就是2个钱包。一个Trust Wallet钱包，加上Meta Mask是我用到的，我现在的话，分了3个钱包就3种类型的，一个就是我从来不会动的差不多也算冷钱包是只进不出的，另外一个就是热钱包是只在opensea进行一个买卖的，另外一个就是小号，小号就是专门用来冲一些土狗mint。交易平台，我现在只会用opensea，还有looks。基本上还是在opensea，也不建议去其他平台。我说的其他交易平台就是，简单举个例子，假如说，我在discord加入了其他社群，就会有一堆人来私信你，你也不知道他干啥的，但是他会给你发个链接，一般像这种的情况下都是诈骗的。\n\n**j.eth**：现在黑客的手段非常多。我自己说一下我的立场吧。我是一个从币圈过来的，但是怎么发的家呢？那个狗狗跟屎币，然后进入NFT的那个时间，大约也就是半年左右,其实我觉得跟那个虚拟货币的区别不大，现在这个市场和去年的那个币圈的市场大约也是同一个时间，土狗层出不穷，而且各种各样，和那些不一样的是，NFT有各种各样可以获取的渠道，Freemint呀或者是进入到他们自己的网站mint呀，这些其实都需要授权的。然后其实黑客他可以把你东西盗走的，无非也就是从通过授权盗走，或者是通过你给的合约盗走，或者是盗取你的钱包，对吧？我首先第一点先从钱包上面来说的话，就是大家下载钱包一定要去官方网站下载。我曾经很多币圈的朋友就是因为去加telegram的社区。然后他们有的时候会给到一些什么这个钱包更新了呀，大家要用这个钱包去下载更新啊。可能咱们就点进去这个东西里面所有的一切跟正常的钱包是一模一样的。但唯一不一样的就是他能拿走你的钱包里面所有的钱。我大部分高质量的也就是价格相对较高的NFT，会有一个新钱包，这个新钱包呢，就是我觉得可以长期持有的，我都会放到硬件钱包里。另一些，比如Freemint呀，或者是我觉得不会持有太久，就会那个出逃获利的。我也是拿新钱包。就是拿几个新钱包去Freemint把这个gas正常花了之后，我再转到我的集中的一个钱包里面，大家可能在NFT圈，discord里面，他们有一个很常见的那个骗人的手段就是跟你私信说这个东西要免费mint了或者是怎么。他们和一些普通的那个网站还不太一样，进去之后，它上面会显示mint的数量，它会不断的变高，那意思就是你要是现在买，他马上就没了。我的第一次NFT被骗mint的就是这么来的。还有一个就是，现在很多类型的免费的空投，上面显示一个非常高的Offer。有人试过了，点了同意了Offer之后你的NFT就没了钱也没了。但是我可能那个对于程序员这方面代码不太了解，具体它是什么一个原理。\n\n**TurtlecaseGang**：关于刚刚说的那个空投。我们有专门去研究过它的合约逻辑，他们会利用一些数据平台，然后他们会筛选出一批高质量的客户，比如说你持有bayc这种蓝筹持有者，他们会筛选出一批这样的地址。然后他们会写一个相当于广告NFT的合约，它能自动的在生成的时候，就把这个广告的这些小图片直接空投到你地址上去。他直接利用这种方式，就相当于流氓广告一样，反正你又不能拒收，第三步就会写一个程序，对你的这个广告的NFT去做非常高价的Offer。当然他也会评估你的资产和他Offer的这个钱，一个价值衡量。如果他是有的赚的，那他就给你Offer，然后Offer完了之后，他会改那个合约里面的相关的函数。他会加一个流氓逻辑就是说你如果接受这个Offer，就要对这些NFT的资产做一个approve，你一旦approved之后，他就可以把你的所有的NFT全转走了，这个是比较形成产业化了，有不少黑客已经批量的在这么干了。这个技术手段比较高的，所以说也非常的防不胜防。\n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥**：我补充一下，刚刚说的这个问题，我也是经常收到一些空投到我钱包里面，有两个，一个是你点进去的时候它有个详情。在左边描述里面有很多链接，如果你是点了这里面的链接的话，就会被盗了，诈骗就是通过点了这个网址被骗的。然后另外一种就是，我也没去尝试啊，就是钱包里面经常有一些在head里面的他给你Offer这种我没有去接受啊，就是这种的话，是很早之前的了，但是我没去做，就是他会给你一个很高的Offer。\n\n**WaTell**：我简单总结了一下，有很多点和我这个经历是一样的。我所有的钱包的助记词还有这个私钥都是全都是记录到我的一个本子上，而且是要记录两次，因为我怕记录一次的话会记错了，到时候就没办法找回这个钱包了。还有一点非常重要，就是主动私聊你的基本上都是骗子。这个东西是非常需要大家谨记一句话。就像飘雪哥，他那个私钥虽然是保存在网盘里，但是它会把那个首尾字母颠倒一下。然后猫哥是把这个密码本保存在自己的大脑里，通过自己这种储存习惯，然后来进行一种助记词的这种存储。这种习惯还真的蛮有趣，因为黑客可以盗取你的这种信息，但是他永远都不会知道你大脑里的这种密码本的习惯。所以说如果大家是真的很懒不像我一样就是一个字一个字把它记下来那你们可以去学一下飘雪哥还有猫哥这种方法。然后还有一点就是大家使用这个MetaMask的时候进行交互，那个插件会有一个弹窗会提醒你，是要求你授权还是要求你签名？这个网站要求是你进行授权的话，那我们千万不要进行这个点击确定，因为要求你进行授权的这些网站，基本上99%全都是那种钓鱼网站，或者骗子网站，真正的正规的网站，它要求你进行交互的时候，只是会要求你进行一个签名，是绝对不可能要求你进行授权的。然后最后一点，就是官方网站的问题。我搜索框里输入了X2y2网站，然后我点击搜索结第一行，他是一个骗子网站，它一般前面都会有2个字就是广告。我有一个朋友前几天就经历过这样的事情，他来进行一个网站交互的时候，他点击了那个前面会有一个广告提示那个网站，然后他进去之后不仅进行了交互，而且他那个网站提示你私钥就是那个助记词出现了问题，他还把那个助记词输入了然后，就被盗取了蛮多钱的。所以说大家就是在网上冲浪的时候一定不要图快就是慢一步其实有的时候会帮你减少很多损失，这也是我的一个经验吧。我其实是一个非常严格执行这些条例的人，所以我基本上web3世界完全没有被盗过一次。\n\n**话题二：NFT有哪些被盗风险？**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang**：我们之前总结过，就是被盗主要有哪几种形式，第一种就是邮件，邮件钓鱼就是黑客会批量的给邮箱去发钓鱼网站的邮件，第2种就是高仿的域名，他可能花钱买广告了然后他就排在这个前面。第3种，就是MetaMask的假钱包。比如说到了他的网站上之后，它会弹出来一个跟MetaMask长得一模一样的这个弹窗你以为浏览器的插件弹出来的钱包弹窗，其实它是利用前端的效果做得跟那个弹窗几乎一模一样，然后第4种，就是很多discord机器人给你发DM，最后一个呢就是官方的这种discord被盗了，那这个时候就要有一定自己的识别和甄别能力，我大概总结就是这几种。\n\n**Piaoxue.eth|胡子观币**：我补充一点就是有一个私钥泄露的风险。比方说有一些账号，他可能是社区共管的这种类型，那可能有别的人，比方说在复制的这个私钥的过程中，它的这个输入法也是存在一个泄露风险的，可能是在这种情况下把私钥泄露出去，最后导致这个钱包被盗。\n\n**j.eth**：个人经历的话其实更多的被盗的应该是我在玩币的时候，NFT现在应该算是老油条了，应该是不太会被盗走，其实说白了就是不要点假的链接，不要相信任何天上掉下的馅饼，不要想到占便宜，自己什么也没付出，突然发一笔横财再多说一句，就是我的私钥和我的助记词怎么弄呢？都是抄下来之后放在了保险箱里。我觉得没有任何东西会比保险箱更加的保险。\n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥**：其实刚刚Allen已经说的很全了。我举2个例子，他刚刚说的邮件，在opensea进行换合约的时候，有很多人收到了假的邮件，那次的损失是比较惨重的。另外一次，在猴的地要出来的时候，提前mint猴地的链接，损失了好一部分。然后后来有一次，猴子的discord又被盗了，几个人也是受到伤害了。我想说的就是即便你关注的是推特或者是discord或者是ins，你都要想到这些都是可能被盗的。大家这个意识一定要警惕，然后第2个就是在你点授权的时候可以看一下小狐狸弹出来那个信息，看一下它是不是安全的。\n\n**WaTell**：大家可以考虑搞一个这种冷钱包，我们基本上有那么几个旧手机，就是重新设置一下出厂设置，在那个就手机上下载一个MetaMask，然后完全不连接网络，你的手机手动的变成那个冷钱包。怎么去鉴别这些风险其实也是蛮重要的一个东西，因为现在很多骗局和骗子这个技术，它确实太高，不光我们在与时俱进，骗子的骗术，这个技术也在时刻进步，让我们这些NFT玩家基本上就是防不胜防。然后还有这个之前出现这种给你传一个PDF文件，都能把你的这个钱包全都给盗走了。\n\n**话题三：如何鉴别NFT的潜在风险？**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang**：我觉得首先就是提高自己的一个鉴别和认知能力。如果你不能看懂代码，你可以利用一些工具，直接告诉你这个合约它是不是只能买不能卖的，或者是不是一个貔貅合约。第2个，我觉得做任何操作都不要着急，比如说你想去mint一个新的NFT，去查一下，比如说推特发的东西，去社群里面真正感受一下，再去做一些投资决策，或者做一些交互的决定。我还想补充的一点就是这个web3这个领域的玩家，其实很多人刚刚进来，没有很强的认知能力或者识别风险的能力，所以我觉得从两方面可以对这个问题去做一些有效的解决方案吧。第一方面我觉得我们要推动这种防盗意识这个科普，这个是我们从业人员或者说进来已经玩了很久了这些人应该去帮他们去搭建一个未来，让他们进来的时候有一个比较好环境。第2个，我觉得我们作为技术人员，应该得有一些自己创新的意识，或者说想要去解决这些问题的一个冲动，不能说这个合约它一成不变，黑客就是掌握绝对的话语权，用自己的技术，能力去跟他们做一个挑战。比如说我们可以在这个合约上做创新，或者去发展硬件。\n\n**TurtlecaseGang**：这个就引申到就是我们之前自己也是被盗了。之前我们是在互联网做安全相关的事情。代码分析这种，我们这个web2领域是属于安全意识非常高的。那来到web3领域之后，即使是我们这样的安全团队也会被黑客攻击，被黑客去钓鱼，那我觉得对于其他的这些小白不能让他们也跟我们一样，一进来，这个钱就损失了。所以我们自己在这个技术上面做了一些创新，我们就是要做一个你盗不走的NFT，比如说NFT长时间决定了要当钻石手不想卖了，那我可以帮在合约上面去加一个函数去帮助你把这个NFT锁起来，就是说你无论怎么样，这个NFT都转不走，除非你自己某一天想要卖了你就可以到我们的这个平台上去把这个NFT解锁，这个时候它才能被交易才能被转让。所以说，一旦你的私钥被盗了，黑客还得去突破第2层去到网站上去解锁。那解锁的时候我们是要求用户提供手机验证码或者邮箱验证码或者谷歌验证码，这个时候，黑客光攻击你的私钥外他还得把你的邮箱也盗了。所以我们觉得，符合用户的一个使用习惯，因为不管是币安或者说discord，都有邮箱验证这些措施。\n\n**WaTell**：咱们在这个自己的网站上又进行了一次防护，帮助持有者进行保管？那我想知道这个保管过程也安全吗？会不会黑客先把咱们这个网站给攻破，然后通过这里面数据库再去攻占其他的这些网站呢？\n\n **TurtlecaseGang**：实现这个其实也不简单，首先我们要去做链下的预言机，然后通过预言机去控制这个NFT的组合，然后去实现加锁解锁。这个后台服务器是拥有对这个预言机的最高权限，所以说这个时候就会带来一个问题如果我们的这个网站崩了，或者被黑客打挂了，他就可以随意的加解锁，我们解决这个问题是分为2步，前期我们肯定会使用一些中心化安全防护，后面会把网站去迁移到去中心化的算力的网络上面，这个就保证第一个我们自己人是没法做恶的，因为它是一个去中心化的部署应用。第2个，防止了单点脆弱性，不会因为一个点被打挂了，整个这个链路就崩溃了。\n\n**MetaCn｜猫哥**：我觉得很简单的判断方法就是，每天都有这么多新的项目，你首先看一下他这个NFT有没有成交量？这是第一个判断的依据。第2个判断你在mint之前把他的合约打开一下，然后在asking里面输入合约地址，看一下交易记录，找几个是mint的，打开他的交易记录。把mint那个人的地址抓出来看看，他是不是一个真实玩家。看看别人的mint记录可以简单判断这是不是一个安全合约。\n\n**TurtlecaseGang**：因为我们本身做代码分析的，所以我们后续会专门针对那个NFT的合约出一个分析的教程或者小工具。直接告诉你，比如说你当前交互的NFT合约，属于哪个标准的，在哪些函数上做了一些改动，或者说这个Mint之后能不能卖，他会不会盗取你多余的授权。我们可能会做一个小工具，让用户能够去非常方便鉴别代码。\n\n**TurtlecaseGang**：现在这个黑客，他可能把这个私钥也盗了，邮箱也盗了。那这个时候我们还提供了一个召回的功能，就是有点像opensea，你被盗了之后去把这个黑产去打标，那这个过程其实也是跟我们一样，我们进行仲裁了之后会把这个打标，其实是不能解决问题的，一定要防止黑客转赃要防止它二次转移，就是他转到自己钱包，或者说他低价Offer。过程当中我们要防止它二次转移，所以我们要对一次转移的一个行为做一个风控的识别，就是要去识别是不是一个异常行为，我们总结一次转移一般什么情况下是一个异常行为呢？要么就是把一个自己的NFT转到不常用的钱包地址上。第2种，是别人给我一个非常低价的Offer，在opensea上，或者在其他的交易平台上。然后我接受了，这个也是比较异常的。第3个，就是他拿到了我的这个授权，然后转走了。然后我们会去识别异常行为，我们会对你的第二次转移做一个时间的限制，自己可以在平台上设置，他这个反应时间是12个小时还是24个小时。在时间内它都是能够防止黑客去销赃的。做这个事情其是帮助他们即使被盗了，也能防止这个真正发生财产的损失。也能够帮他们直接把NFT召回，就是直接reclaim到他的原来的账户上，或者reclaim到这个项目方的账户上。\n\n**话题四：NFT被盗后如何维权？**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang**：我们当时被盗了之后，就是给这个opensea他们去举报，然后去让他们把这个黑产去打标，但是opensea的仲裁过程其实蛮长的啊，两三天之后我的被盗的才打上标，第2个是你要在社区里面去找一些大佬帮你喊。第3个，你可以用这工具给黑客地址去做一些妥协吧，比如说愿意半价把这个NFT再买回来，这样你可以少损失一半的钱，当然妥协这件事情我是不会做的，大概就是这几种方法吧，所以我们在这个合约创意上也是做了一个就是帮助用户在事后可以去做一些事情的方法。\n\n**Piaoxue.eth | 胡子观币**：我自己的话没有被盗过，但我身边朋友确实有被盗的。他应该是因为私钥泄露，钱包被盗了，里边有一个月鸟，还有其他的加密货币，总体有100万左右的人民币的一个损失，然后他就去报警了，立案的过程比较艰难，但最后应该是已经立案了，立案之后可以通过数据分析，慢雾啊，他们可以帮他去找这个当时盗他的地址，然后IP，包括交易所的kyc，但是最后好像查到了可能的人，那其中有一些人用的是假kyc，但是报警的确是一个可行的选择。在国内，就比方说你的这个金额超过50万的话，你可以尝试一下去报警，提供一些你的材料。我自己在买猴子的时候，其实买过2个猴子都是被盗的，一个是opensea上买的，我买的时候他没被盗，因为那个时候美国那边就是晚上，等于是半夜被人盗了直接就挂出来，我就买了，买了以后，他还通过推特跟我沟通，说这个是被盗的。然后他说他会去opensea上仲裁。然后后来果然就被opensea给锁了。我觉得这也是需要行业内去讨论怎么解决的问题，下家毕竟也是花了真金白银去买的。我特别认可刚才allen他们要做这个事儿，我理解他们可能是要做一个线上保险柜的这种业务，他可以给我整体账户做一个保障，哪怕说我私钥被盗了，还有可能去他们那里去验证一步，就能很大程度去增加黑客盗你NFT的难度。\n\n**话题五：NFT被盗经历分享**\n\n**TurtlecaseGang**：第一次是被骗的，我mint了杰伦熊，结果卖得比较早，卖光了之后他就飞涨，然后杰伦熊的discord里面有人给我发DM，他说这个只要零点几就能mint了然后赶紧冲，我就赶紧mint了一个，结果就被骗，这个是比较低级的一个。另外一个是点击到一个链接，他直接让钱包做授权。然后这个授权就是把你的所有NFT都拿走了，主要就是这2个经历，然后我就非常生气，就是感觉这个领域的骗子也太嚣张了，然后又觉得我们自己本身就是做安全的，就觉得这也太丢人了。我们几个就去商量怎么去跟他们作对抗打击他们，就慢慢的有了今天的这些想法。这是我自己的一个经历。\n\n**j.eth**：不小心进了一个骗子网站，mint的剩余数量显示越来越少，就赶紧去mint，mint的时候你会发现他本来上面写的是0.5或者是0.05但是他mint的时候就是把你那个钱包里面所有的以太坊全部转走。我也不知道这个是什么操作，这我是亏最惨的。大家呢不论是玩NFT还是玩币，一定不要fomo，大家不要觉得这个东西买不到了，钱就赚不到了。我在币圈里面总结了一个经验就是这个没有了下一个可能比这个还厉害，就是我的经历。关于NFT被盗，也有很多项目方的自导自演，就是包括很多币被盗，可能都是项目方的自导自演。当然了，我这也没有办法查证，毕竟咱人微言轻啊，身处的国家也不同。关于跨国啊，这个我还真经历过一回，也是一个黑客，把整个农场里面所有的币盗走的一个事儿。当时我在中国，因为我是那个币里边相当大的一个大户，我的钱都放进农场里面去挖矿了，这个黑客也是项目方技术人员之一。然后现在在新加坡，然后这个项目方呢，是美国人在美国啊。大家想一想这个东西有多复杂，想抓也没有那么简单。大家一定要想好的一个问题，千万不要贪小便宜，只要不贪小便宜，别人就骗不着你。而且我一直以来信奉的一个东西，就是一定要拿自己额外的钱进入这个web3或者是玩NFT也好，玩币也好，不要去把自己的身家压上。\n\n**Piaoxue.eth | 胡子观币**：我的话没有什么被盗经历能分享，我觉得我可以一个受害者的角度跟大家分享一下，就是我买到被盗的之后怎么办的问题，尤其是在opensea上买到的，他后面才标记的这种就挺亏的，我大概比地板价低了5%左右吧，才卖掉的。去Looks上卖的。我觉得这个体验就很不好，买到一个图，结果当天或者第2天他就跟我说我这个是被盗的，然后我也不能把它认证了，所以我觉得这个是受害者视角体验很差，希望粉丝能想一个更好的解决方法，不然的话是对他下面的用户不负责任。很不公平。我是建议，就未来有没有可能就是行业达成某一个协议也好，或者是达成一个新的共识吧。就这个事儿，最后就是一个个人行为，不要牵扯到下家的问题了。\n\n**JJJ丨AvatarDao**：NFT被盗我没有过，但是我钱包被盗过，有以太坊雪崩链上的币，他给我盗走了，但至今到现在，我也不知道是怎么给我盗的。我链上看了地址，他好多的交易记录都是在coinlist相关，但是我不知道他是怎么给我盗走的，有哪些交集在这些平台上，所以为什么会我们会聚焦在这个地方被这类的人盗走，那可能是我哪儿泄露了比如私钥。我就是总结一些经验，我复制过我的私钥，在微信发过，从我的手机传到我的电脑上，这样复制过，也许会跟这个有关，但是我不确定，就警戒大家这个，从那个之后，我没有再复制过这个私钥了，这种方式一定不要用，它还是有一定的安全隐患。\n\n**C919.eth**：我是完全赖自己。那个时候不懂，整了个MetaMask钱包也不懂什么助记词不能泄露啊，拿手机截的屏，我后来怀疑我被盗的过程应该是在那个电报群谁发了个什么链接点链接免费领空头时候确认授权了吧，然后丢了几张不值钱的图片，我就这么一个经历，这就是想说新人特别容易被盗，就是什么都不懂时候。现在我防盗的方式是认为以后要长期持有的，我会把它转到一个新钱包，这个钱包只在一个iPhone上，然后这个iPhone什么都不下载，只有一个微信，一个钱包，剩下什么都没有，就当一个硬件钱包用。\n\n**anling.eth**：我没有过NFT被盗的经验，但是我的钱包被盗了，我了解的一个项目，就潜伏到他们discord想学习他们怎么运营的，就有人给我发私信说他们的那个特别便宜。然后我就点了进去，应该就是连接了他们的网站，在最后一步，我的同事拦住我说这是骗子，但是我那个时候应该我的钱包已经暴露了。但是当时不知道，后来想买一个东西，我就往里面转了钱，转了好几次钱，发现我的钱为什么都消失了我还觉得很奇怪是我打错了，后来发现就被盗了，我的经历就是这样，所以说其实就是对于新人进入这个行业还是要有一定的时间先去学习安全方面的知识，我觉得在我们这个圈子还是比较缺乏的，所以说我们这个项目就很希望去帮助大家提高安全意识，如何去防盗，然后让大家不要这么轻易的就犯这种错误\n\n**C919.eth**：我感觉如果能在最初期刚接触的时候被盗，他不一定是一件坏事儿，就是你真被盗一次，然后你才真正的有这个经历，这个防范意识。\n\n**JJJ丨AvatarDao**：我是觉得这个主题在现在我们这个阶段就特别合适。安全方面的一个问题，因为现在这个行情，咱们谈怎么赚钱，其实没什么意思吗？除了2级，即使项目这块也没有什么，但是安全这块就是包括钱包啊，这些都是说在我们币圈一个比较基础的内容，而不是说像比如交易或者是搞项目，哪些人能赚钱，都需要沉淀时间去了解去学习的，像我们趟过这种被骗的雷，你在这个阶段跟交易不同，你是完全可以避开这个雷的，因为它是一些基础知识，你可以直接需要通过，比如我们今天这些嘉宾也好，工具也好，这些介绍都可以了解到，避免被盗，跟大家说一下，真的不是危言耸听，可能大家觉得玩了好久了，我也没被盗，怎么那么容易被盗？当你被盗的时候就是你非常无助，你没有任何办法，盗了你的钱就是没了，希望引起大家重视\n\n**WaTell**：可能有的时候确实需要一次惨痛经历才能让我们成长，才能让我们讲这个记性。然后我们今天搞这个Space，也是希望通过大家，嘉宾的这些经验，或者说这种惨痛经历能给大家起到一种警示的作用，帮助大家即使不用被实地的骗过一次，也可以获得这种比较强的安全保护意识。\n\n**TurtlecaseGang**：我们这个NFT项目呢是永不被盗的，所以说如果你在其他地方遭遇过被盗的经历啊，或者说这个钱都丢失的，很无助的这种经历的话，那我觉得可以来看看我们这个项目以及我们做的合约的创新。",

It can bring benefits to human civilization.\n2. Some people want it and pay a good price.\n\nThey are completely different, but they do not conflict with each other.\n\nThings could be used those means to explain their value. For Examples:\n\n**Electric Power** In my opinion, electric power brings benefits to human civilization. And normal people get it very cheap.\n\n**Hermès's bag** From my point of view luxury goods doesn't bring anything to human civilization. But they are very very expensive.\n\n**SpaceX's rocket** I honestly think that the rocket brings great benefits to human civilization, and it is very expensive.\n\n**Current the article** As far as I'm concerned, this article neither brings anything to human civilization, nor no one wants to pay any price.\n\nIf you ask me what is the value of blockchain now, I need to know which value is you asked for.\n\nI will discuss each value of blockchain below.\n\n## Blockchain brings human civilization benefit\n\n### What is blockchain?\n\nI try to explain blockchain in simple words. From my point of view, blockchain is a digital ownership management system base on math and cryptography. It can not modify history records. It only adds records.\n\nBlockchain gives wallet address ownership. Every wallet address is equal. They trust each other. There is the most important thing on the blockchain.\n\nIn my way of thinking all blockchain products from the digital ownership management.\n\n### From Homo sapiens win to publish The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America\n\nI read about how Homo sapiens won in a book. Because Homo sapiens create language, then they used language to get trust in each other. Finally, Homo sapiens gained consensus and killed Neanderthals.\n\nTo my mind, The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America was a consensus reached by the representatives of the 13 colonies after mutual trust and discussion. Currently, that consensus creates the No.1 country on the earth.\n\nFrom the above two examples, I believe that consensus and trust are the cornerstones of human civilization.\n\nBut in the real world an interesting thing. Every single one of them has seven deadly sins. It is very difficult to reach a consensus through trust inside the real world.\n\nThis has led to various problems in current human civilization.\n\n### Blockchain's vision of the value it brings to human civilization\n\nBlockchain is a natural solution to the trust and consensus problem. Human being gets one more way to build trust and consensus. This may provide an additional option for solving the problems of human civilization.\n\nTo my way of thinking blockchain will be like electric power. It will exist everywhere. It acts as a basic component for humans in the scenario of trust, consensus, and ownership. The new approach will then reconfigure the entire human organizational system. Humanity will open the next era.\n\n## How much is Blockchain?\n\nSome people ask, \"Why are BTC, ETH, and NFT so expensive?\" The answer is very simple, some people like to pay this price to buy them. It is just a price.\n\nIf you need more explanation, I will tell you a little story:\n\n> A and B are two rich people walking in the park and suddenly find a pile of dog shit on the road. A says to B: \"You eat the dog shit, and I will pay you 50 million. \" B ate the dog shit and A paid already 50 million.

{"id": "YQZS5QuPXy6SnW1H4Eygi50HReHET01jFiovJP8oq80", "title": "致10K社区成员的公开信", "body": "各位34D持有者、10K Universe建设者、关心ENS发展的朋友们\n\n大家好！\n\n我是5660.eth，我是我的数字，我的数字是我。\n\n最近看到ENS市场中一些由10K Club Discord社群创始人等带动的乱象：他们通过抢先注册一些非34D数字域名，然后借34D价格上涨之机，大肆宣传，忽悠其他人高价买入从而谋取不正当利益。此外，他们之前还曾意图出卖社区，并在期间打压其他34D建设者。\n\n经过慎重思考，我决定将背后的一些故事以及他们的一些不良行为讲出来，希望能让大家提高警惕，保持理性。\n\n声明：本人将对以下陈述负全部举证责任并保证真实性。\n\n**行径一：意图出卖社区**\n\n作为NFT研究员，在ENS的10K概念刚诞生的时候，我认为非常有趣，于是便对它进行了深入研究。同时，通过10K Club的Discord社群，我也结识了一些ENS深度爱好者和技术大佬。大家都看到了34D的潜力，买入并坚定持有了34D。同时，我们也想利用自身的特长，为34D赋能，增加34D的价值。\n\n但是，我所认识的这些持有者，技术和研究人员偏多，比如有加密货币交易所的研究员、知名NFT的核心开发人员、上市公司的前技术总监等。\n\n我们并不擅长社群运营，于是就希望与10K Club的DC群创始人合作，由他们运营社群，我们负责研究和开发，一起为34D赋能，给34D持有者提供更多福利。\n\n五月初我们做了规划：一是应用专利技术，建立10kmap.io，为34D持有者提供便利，并逐渐发展成一个统一元宇宙；二是做一个精选的NFT交易平台（10kuni.io，待发布），集成一些NFT研究成果，提高34D交易体验，并逐渐给34D赋能。\n\n但是，事与愿违。10K Club的DC群创始人们（如260.eth, aox.eth，oneill.eth）对10K Builder给34D赋能的计划并不感兴趣。而又由于那段时间有一篇中文文章《一名28岁的普通A9+讲述：为什么4digits ENS域名一定会成为域名领域的无聊猿》在海内外的广泛传播，而我是中国人，并积极推动给34D赋能，他们猜测我就是那个身家A9的中国富豪。于是，在我和他们讨论合作，想一起为34D赋能时，他们却想通过出卖社区赚取一大笔资金。\n\n以下是260.eth的回复，他们说他们不关心34D支持者们要做什么，如果我们需要社群，他们可以以1000ETH（当时折合价格为280万美元）的价格卖给我们！这可以买超过500个4D！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y1h1EsEWUZmSg4v7eB8XI.png?height=165&width=865)\n\n后来可能自己也认为自己穷疯了，不太好意思，降价到500ETH。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OrWVL_pO5b9eqIbeAc7pw.png?height=80&width=865)\n\n我很佩服他们的眼光，当时10K Club社群不足7000人，他们就看到了社群巨大的价值潜力（如果他们如今已经完成了社区出卖，请社区成员找他索要属于你的那一份，毕竟你也是其中的7000分之一）。同时，我也觉得十分荒诞离奇，原来他们始终都没有想着为34D做一些贡献，而是想着从中收割，谋取不正当的私利。\n\n三个创始人，260.eth,aox.eth，713.eth(现在叫oneill.eth)，我反复和他们进行了沟通。\n\n我认为10K这个概念不错，大家也都是持有者（后来发现，原来只有我们是持有者，而他们已经卖出了自己手中大部分的34D，非常讽刺），能够发挥自己所长，一起做好一件事就完美了。但没想到这些人格局这么差，提出了上述令人作呕的方案。\n\n后来其他10K Builder就建议我单独建立一个社区。而我当时仍然一直认为我们都应该为34D赋能，没必要再去建一个社区，从而导致社区分裂，一起将10K Club做好就很好了。为此我还想了折中方案，并给他们都一一发送了消息，近乎低三下四地去和他们沟通。\n\n260\\.eth直接不再回复。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LhLww1MsyCshus_DpO46P.png?height=345&width=865)\n\n以下是aox.eth回复（是的，我得到了fucked）,并拉黑了我。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SJCbICXlSVSWEJ9yDeQjN.png?height=813&width=633)\n\n713\\.eth还直接教我怎么割韭菜了，显然深谙其中道理，呵呵。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyGW0bFNYWHnoouQKfypM.png?height=746&width=607)\n\n这是我对他的回复\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SyzjolmaAyzqVOjzzpuhY.png?height=422&width=626)\n\n最终我和很多社区成员也非常无奈，只能选择逐渐再建立一个社区。但是，当时我认为34D在发展早期，没有必要把他们这些丑陋行径说出来，导致社区分裂（我现在才知道我的善良带来了多大的失误，使得他们继续从中谋取不正当利益，给社区成员造成了巨大的损失）。\n\n**行径二：打压其他34D建设者**\n\n在技术团队的没日没夜工作下，比特币披萨节当天，俱乐部网站10kmap.io正式上线。同时我们成立了10K Universe的DC社群。由社区成员志愿捐献，我们拿出了5个4D域名以及7.5ETH开展活动，鼓励大家熟悉ENS的操作。第一轮活动中，我们的宣传口号是“价值500ETH的4D域名赠送”的原因，其一是认为未来4D价格也许能像无聊猿一样，涨到100E的水平，另外也是嘲讽10K Club DC创始人想以500ETH价格将 DC社区成员出卖这件事。\n\n之后，我们也会去10K CLUB 的DC群发一些动态，让大家关注项目发展，鼓励大家参与活动，也能获得一些福利。但是，当他们发现10K Universe热度起来了，有34D持有者逐渐加入了10K Universe，这可能不利于他们将来割韭菜了，哈哈。\n\n然后他们可能就找了一个10K CLUB管理员，3070.eth，在10K Club社群内公开污蔑10K Universe花钱买机器人粉丝之类，并拿出了所谓的“证据”。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GvSLUPyu-FHwcIIU5teLn.png?height=154&width=865)\n\n我对他进行了反驳，以上是我给他的解释。那段时间社区成员仅增长了几百人，而且是因为有中国的KOL帮我们进行了宣传。因为10K Universe社区志愿者Hanz之前参与管理过的社群曾遭受过机器人攻击，他担心有机器人加入社群，甚至手动封禁了100多个账户（那时候整个社群人数才1000多人），反而因此误封了很多真实用户。\n\n所以我想让3070.eth拿出他的证据来源，看是不是存在机器人。于是，我私聊了他，而他至今都没有回复，但却直接在10K CLUB将我禁言了7天！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NOIjr9Ediwa3isTH1TQ6m.png?height=527&width=865)\n\n这些人的行为实在让我伤心透了。从此之后，我就再也没去10K Club的DC群说过一句话。\n\n**行径三：违背社区投票结果，抢先注册一些域名，并通过宣传，意图高价卖给社区成员**\n\n虽然他们的举动让我受了一些委屈，但本来想着也没必要说出这些事情，占用公共资源。而且，之前关注到他们的账户，他们基本也把自己手里的34D都卖光了，想必该消停点了。没想到最近34D的价格刚有点起色，他们又开始动歪心思了，悄悄注册了某些品类的域名。然后，以260.eth为首，在推特更换带有阿拉伯头巾的头像，修改自己的推特名字，并鼓励不知情的其他用户也进行修改，通过鼓吹阿拉伯语数字域名和炒作中文数字域名等，意图进一步地割韭菜。炒作阿拉伯语数字域名和中文数字域名，难道不是因为他们认为阿拉伯人和中国人人傻钱多？\n\n要知道，曾经10K Club社群还发起过投票，删除了所有非34D域名的其他频道！而他们和少数人居然为了自己的利益，违背社区的投票结果，公开宣传34D以外的域名，从而高价卖给被蒙骗的用户！\n\n删除其他频道的提案和目的\n\n[https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e](https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e)\n\n260\\.eth更换了戴有阿拉伯头巾的头像，并更改了推特名字\n\n我想知道他是否清楚阿拉伯头巾的正确佩戴方法及含义。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjN7CjsNnhG1OcGmSYR5-.png?height=636&width=865)\n\n在推特频繁宣传阿拉伯语数字域名。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RAvL6nsHZ0ZRy4Fwju-xu.png?height=1285&width=865)\n\n最近又转向对其他域名的宣传\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/exUZK-8QY9FvfO5brxg13.png?height=655&width=865)\n\n我想人们一旦购买了它，他们钱包中的资金将会减少。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xYKk08zTeN_vQM3tcSMPi.png?height=1201&width=865)\n\n于此同时，他却提前注册，并试图高价出售这些他非常看好的域名。既然如此坚定看好，为什么你却以如此低的价格出售？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZIAf8PHcAUojOJpjkhY1_.png?height=265&width=865)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kVbRaGQI6Ti3eHqhGXa1_.png?height=439&width=865)\n\n同时他仍在不断注册新的域名\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7kTKm1WLG6DAp5d5RuErv.png?height=495&width=865)\n\n请注意，这还只是他的公开账号。当你看到一只蟑螂在地板上乱窜时，很可能还有很多只蟑螂藏在冰箱后面或者水槽下面。\n\n他们这些行为让我感到不舒服。因此，我决定将这背后的故事讲出来，交给社区去评判。希望社区成员能够擦亮眼睛，保持理智，不要被少数人蒙骗，进而损失资金。也希望34D持有者不要因为个别人的行径，就对34D丧失信心，作为未来的Web3身份中的蓝筹，它的未来价值也不会受到个别社群成员不良行为的影响。而我们依然有着强大的10K Universe社区，将会为34D不断增加新的有趣又有价值的场景。\n\n我始终认为，君子爱财，取之有道，在此也正告260.eth等人，不要再做一些通过伤害社区利益而谋取个人私利的事情了！\n\n目前，仍有很多 10K Builder 在不断为 34D 宣传和增加价值，请保持信心和关注。同时 也欢迎大家加入 10K Universe 社区，建设一个更加强大的 10K 未来。

CLUB将我禁言了7天！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NOIjr9Ediwa3isTH1TQ6m.png?height=527&width=865)\n\n这些人的行为实在让我伤心透了。从此之后，我就再也没去10K Club的DC群说过一句话。\n\n**行径三：违背社区投票结果，抢先注册一些域名，并通过宣传，意图高价卖给社区成员**\n\n虽然他们的举动让我受了一些委屈，但本来想着也没必要说出这些事情，占用公共资源。而且，之前关注到他们的账户，他们基本也把自己手里的34D都卖光了，想必该消停点了。没想到最近34D的价格刚有点起色，他们又开始动歪心思了，悄悄注册了某些品类的域名。然后，以260.eth为首，在推特更换带有阿拉伯头巾的头像，修改自己的推特名字，并鼓励不知情的其他用户也进行修改，通过鼓吹阿拉伯语数字域名和炒作中文数字域名等，意图进一步地割韭菜。炒作阿拉伯语数字域名和中文数字域名，难道不是因为他们认为阿拉伯人和中国人人傻钱多？\n\n要知道，曾经10K Club社群还发起过投票，删除了所有非34D域名的其他频道！而他们和少数人居然为了自己的利益，违背社区的投票结果，公开宣传34D以外的域名，从而高价卖给被蒙骗的用户！\n\n删除其他频道的提案和目的\n\n[https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e](https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e)\n\n260\\.eth更换了戴有阿拉伯头巾的头像，并更改了推特名字\n\n我想知道他是否清楚阿拉伯头巾的正确佩戴方法及含义。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjN7CjsNnhG1OcGmSYR5-.png?height=636&width=865)\n\n在推特频繁宣传阿拉伯语数字域名。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RAvL6nsHZ0ZRy4Fwju-xu.png?height=1285&width=865)\n\n最近又转向对其他域名的宣传\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/exUZK-8QY9FvfO5brxg13.png?height=655&width=865)\n\n我想人们一旦购买了它，他们钱包中的资金将会减少。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xYKk08zTeN_vQM3tcSMPi.png?height=1201&width=865)\n\n于此同时，他却提前注册，并试图高价出售这些他非常看好的域名。既然如此坚定看好，为什么你却以如此低的价格出售？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZIAf8PHcAUojOJpjkhY1_.png?height=265&width=865)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kVbRaGQI6Ti3eHqhGXa1_.png?height=439&width=865)\n\n同时他仍在不断注册新的域名\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7kTKm1WLG6DAp5d5RuErv.png?height=495&width=865)\n\n请注意，这还只是他的公开账号。当你看到一只蟑螂在地板上乱窜时，很可能还有很多只蟑螂藏在冰箱后面或者水槽下面。\n\n他们这些行为让我感到不舒服。因此，我决定将这背后的故事讲出来，交给社区去评判。希望社区成员能够擦亮眼睛，保持理智，不要被少数人蒙骗，进而损失资金。也希望34D持有者不要因为个别人的行径，就对34D丧失信心，作为未来的Web3身份中的蓝筹，它的未来价值也不会受到个别社群成员不良行为的影响。而我们依然有着强大的10K Universe社区，将会为34D不断增加新的有趣又有价值的场景。\n\n我始终认为，君子爱财，取之有道，在此也正告260.eth等人，不要再做一些通过伤害社区利益而谋取个人私利的事情了！本人将对以上陈述负全部举证责任并保证真实性。如果260.eth等人，仍然继续侵害社区利益，我将在我个人推特进一步揭露。\n\n[https://twitter.com/web3saltman](https://twitter.com/web3saltman)\n\n目前，仍有很多

Builder/@blockmaniaDAO）。以下是直播内容摘录：**\n\n**MasterQ（DAO Builder/@blockmaniaDAO）**\n\n欢迎大家来到 0x499 主办的推特 Space，我们今天的主题是：买了猴子就开猴子餐厅？NFT的知识产权：你需要知道的全部信息。现在很多人买了 NFT、把 NFT 作为头像；包括一些投资机构买了 NFT，不知道能不能开放给自己的被投企业做授权使用，所以今天请到几位嘉宾一起讨论，你买了 NFT 到底意味着什么，有什么权利可以做什么事情，以及未来可以利用 NFT 来做更多的比如说分红还是其他什么东西。接下来首先有请各位嘉宾做一下自我介绍：\n\n**七爷（Astrolegal合伙人律师/@victoryvictorz)**\n\nAstrolegal 是北京的一家律所，专注于数字化领域的法律问题研究，其中比较重要就是 Web3 里面比如说 DAO 的治理、NFT 和数字货币相关的部分。我们在民商事和刑事在两方面都各有特色，大家有法律相关的问题都欢迎找到我们。\n\n**MasterLi（LegalDAO发起人/@MasterLHZ）**\n\nLegalDAO 是一个 Web3 秩序跟正义的法律人社区，也在做产品、监管、去中心化层面的一些创新，我也是律师出身，DAO 内部经常有人问买了 NFT 之后能够做什么，能不能围绕 NFT 做二创，这些都涉及到 NFT 的知识产权，我觉得今天是一个很好的机会能够跟大家系统地一起探讨这个话题，给大家提供一些指导。\n\n**MasterQ（DAO Builder/@blockmaniaDAO）**\n\n**可能很多人购买 NFT 的时候，可能更多地去关注团队、路线图、画风、社区等等因素，从来没有留意过 NFT 的版权信息，能否为我们介绍一下 NFT 的版权归属有哪几种分类，各种分类之下持有者各享有什么权益？**\n\n**七爷（Astrolegal合伙人律师/@victoryvictorz)**\n\n我们今天聊 NFT 版权其实是一个限缩的概念。因为 NFT 作为一个 Token，理论上可以跟任何物理世界的东西做关联，所以我们今天聊到的 NFT 是只跟艺术品相关的类型，所以先把这个定义明确一下。NFT 版权到底什么意思？NFT 本身代表的是一个艺术创作品在区块链里面的权属证明。比如说我们现在买了一幅画，同时给你一张证书，NFT 就是证书的电子化呈现。证书是没有版权的，只能证明证书关联的艺术作品有版权，法律对电子化艺术作品版权的性质没有做单独的规定，只能套用目前关于著作权相关的规定。\n\n目前看到的 NFT 版权类型氛围两大类，第一大类叫买了就能用，你买了 NFT 就获得了 Token 背后的艺术作品完整的版权，包括再利用、授权、复制等功能。比如 BAYC  在公告里面说了，持有者可以获得在世界范围内商业上的无限许可，就意味着可以利用 NFT 背后所有的经济价值使用权。因此李宁买了 BAYC 之后可以做服装联名，倍轻松买了 BAYC 之后可以在广告里面去使用这个头像，这都是艺术作品的商业化使用。\n\n第二大类就是买了 NFT 以后，使用可能会受到限制的这种情况，这个跟我们传统理解的惯性就不一样了。一般我们理解在现实世界买到了一幅作品，商业潜能就赋予你了，很少会在合同里会对这些权益会有一些限制。但是在 Web3 世界，通过项目方发公告的方式可以进行各种各样的限制，比如规定你不能二次商用，或者二次商用的时候收益不能享有，需要在转让收益层面给之前持有人进行分配，或者有些规定你只能自己使用，不能进行对外商业授权，商业价值完全归属于项目方所有，都有可能。这一类的代表比较典型的就是 Azuki。Azuki 在项目公告里面说的是，NFT 持有者只是拥有 Token 所有权，除了条款的明确授权之外，并未获得艺术作品、品牌以及相应的知识产权。翻译成大白话来说就是，Azuki 把 Token 卖给了持有人，但是背后艺术作品的所有知识产权都收归己有。这个时候你要对 NFT 做二次商用的话，还需要额外得到 Azuki 的同意。所以 NFT 版权总体上氛围两大类，一种是完全许可，一种是可种各样的限制。\n\n其实 NFT 除了图片外，还有视频、音乐、文字。对于 NFT 的只是产权问题要去细分的话，可以把著作权法规定的十几项权能，每个都去做单独的限制。比如说信息化传播权，即把图片用作头像、商业化海报使用的权利。当然目前来说还是我们刚刚提到的两种比较多，一种是要么全部都给，一种是要么全都不给，没怎么见到项目方去详细规定一部分给、另一部分不给的情况，如果遇到的话，我们要注意去避免踩坑。大家在买 NFT 的时候，一般只关注项目运营方面的信息，原因是并没有对 NFT 做再利用的目的，核心是想买了之后通过转售的方式获得利润，但是整个市场的泡沫在被慢慢挤掉，可能要慢慢回归的 NFT 的艺术价值和商业价值上面来，这里面在使用的时候就涉及到你对它知识产权可利用的丰富程度，比如说音乐 NFT，你能不能享有改编权，文字作品 NFT 有没有改变成电影剧本的权利，BAYC 能不能改变成动画片，这都是版权再利用过程中会面临的问题。\n\n最后是没有任何合同或者声明之类的项目，那么你买了之后，按照中国目前的著作权法，应该是默认为获得除了署名权之外的所有权益。\n\n**MasterQ（DAO Builder/@blockmaniaDAO）**\n\n**之前杭州宣判了被称为全国首例的 NFT 侵权案，某数藏平台称用户铸造的知名 IP 形象 NFT 是其自行上传，与平台无关。而法律判决平台未尽到审查义务，构成侵权。怎么看待这个判决结果？**\n\n**七爷（Astrolegal合伙人律师/@victoryvictorz)**\n\n这个案件是杭州互联网法院判的，一审判完之后就爆出来了，他们自己称是 NFT 第一案，这里面肯定有法院自我宣传方面的考量。这个案子有意思的点是，没有把 NFT 项目方作为当事人，主要针对的事数藏平台，这个跟国内的监管和司法思路是有关系的。\n\n大家都知道国内平台经济比国外还发达一些，比如在淘宝买了假货之后，你可能很难知道卖家的个人信息，通常做法是起诉淘宝，淘宝说可以向你提供背后的卖家信息；如果你是在天猫上买的，天猫是有公开的商家信息的，那很多人也会把天猫当做案子的被告，因为平台是负有监管责任的，这是国内整个的监管和司法逻辑。那么在 NFT 第一案里面，用户在平台发布 NFT 作品，平台是不是要审核他的只是产权，这是一个争议焦点。其实之前在实务界里面，我们律师大概率认为平台是很难对著作权做一个审核，因为国内著作权是没有必要做登记的。那么在这个案子里面，有一个隐含的意思就是，平台你知道在你这发 NFT 的项目方，不是 IP 形象本来的公司，就有义务做更深一步的审查，比如是买来的，还是通过授权获得的。在这种情况下判了平台有对项目的审查责任。\n\n那么这个案子判了之后，是不是意味着数藏平台都要去审查项目方的知识产权呢，如果问我最合规的意见，我肯定会说你们得向项目方去要一个版权声明，或者版权证明，但这是限于 NFT 数量有限的情况下，平台方有能力和时间去审查，假设将来中国数藏市场蓬勃发展，变得像淘宝、天猫、京东一样可能由几十万个商机，几亿个 SKU 的情况下，你还能不能够这么去规定，其实不一定所以这个案件，站在我们的角度，建议大家不要过度解读，它并不能代表 NFT 在中国包括监管和司法领域的统一意见，并且是充满了争议，有各种特性在里面的。所以最后总结一下就是，在国内，目前每个数藏平台有自己的规则，可以考虑加上一条，要求项目方上传一个版权证明，如果没有证明可以换成版权声明或者承诺。\n\n对于平台发布 NFT 的项目方而言，最合规一定是享有作品完整授权。之前有一个徐悲鸿的几幅实体画被某个富豪买了在数藏平台发行 NFT，这里面的争议就是徐悲鸿的作品已经进入公用领域，去世时间已经超过 50 年，这时候实体画的拥有者有没有资格去发布 NFT。包括天坛、故宫在发布 NFT 的时候，有没有资格代表天坛、故宫甚至中国去发布 NFT，这些问题实际上都在讨论当中，没有一个明确的定论。所以说法律行业的研究还在刚刚起步，潜心研究 NFT 也不是法律界的一个主流显学，没有足够多的监管案例，也没有足够多的监管意见和司法意见。\n\n**MasterQ（DAO Builder/@blockmaniaDAO）**\n\n**如果是项目方的原因造成 NFT 的知识产权争议，我个人又买了这个 NFT 的话，我的权益会受到什么影响？**\n\n**七爷（Astrolegal合伙人律师/@victoryvictorz)**\n\n如果项目方不享有 NFT 的知识产权的话，理论上买了的人也不享有知识产权。类似于我买到了一个没有权利的东西。比如说 MasterLi 卖给我一辆车，说这辆车是他自己的，结果 MasterQ 说，不对，这辆车只是我暂存在 MaseterLi 那边，他无权处分。那这种情况买卖合同是无效的，我需要把车还给持有人 MasterQ。印象中 NFT 第一案里面，是要把卖出去的 NFT 销毁掉，买家可以向项目方和平台方追偿。\n\n**MasterLi（LegalDAO发起人/@MasterLHZ）**\n\n这里面有一个问题是，有些权益是善意取得，有些比如说像这个案子里面，NFT 不受法律保护就要去销毁它，这里面就有一个市场价值的损害。因为 Opensea 出现过好多次，比如说这个项目挺火的，突然爆出来用的是别人的图，一下整个损失就非常大，Opensea 是没有 KYC 的，就会产生很多问题。\n\nNFT 为什么跟知识产权联系紧密，还是跟卖小图片有直接关系。小图片就有商用还是不商用的选择，尤其是现在已经有一些实践的前提下。我个人认为 NFT 其实只是作品商用的一种形式，即你把一幅作品铸造成 NFT，就是你用这种小图片的一种方式，跟你把这个图做成一个视频、做二创，从法律本质上我不认为有任何区别，只是一种商用手段，卖 NFT 也是一种商用手段，这是我看这个问题的观点。\n\n**MasterQ（DAO Builder/@blockmaniaDAO）**\n\n**模仿、抄袭一直是 NFT  交易市场为人所诟病的重大问题，Opensea 曾多次表示下大力气治理。解决版权问题只能靠平台自律吗？在法律实务中，项目方应该提前采取哪些措施，避免 NFT 的价值因版权原因被稀释。**\n\n**七爷（Astrolegal合伙人律师/@victoryvictorz)**\n\n咱们讲物权、所有权的时候是可以跨国界的，不管人在什么地方，你享有一辆车的所有权，那这个东西就是归你的。但是知识产权的传播是有一个国别保护和跨国界保护的问题，到 web3 世界更是这样子，就是你很难去准确证明项目发行方，可能不是一个实体，甚至不是一个人，它可能是个 DAO 或者是什么形式，那他怎么能够享有这个著作权。即第一这个权利是什么样子，第二权利的所有人是什么样子，第三就是权利的证明形式，整个市场还在一个比较早期的情况下，目前看到的就是，我们时不时会听到一些，比如 NFT 项目方暴雷，或者因为不享有作品的知识产权或者其他瑕疵，导致商业价值贬损，但是在大的主流里面，还没有大比例出现这种情况，我估计大家都在琢磨，平台方也想尽可能减少这种情况发生，但是不排除市场还在炒作，因为一个市场想要火起来，必须好的项目坏的项目都要有，完成一个良币驱逐劣币的过程，所以我不怀好意地揣测，包括国内的数藏平台和 Opensea，应该是都有意为之地放一马，就是你先把项目发行了，用户搞到位再说，出问题再解决问题，所以目前我是没有看到一套完全合规的监管。\n\n另外从技术的角度，如果你提供了完整的作品，比如说图片甚至短视频，其实技术手段是可以做到，只不过成本比较高，比如说我多久时间刷一遍 Opensea 有没有侵犯我著作权的项目，如果只有一幅画那还好办，现在我手头有几十个几百个上千个，那维权成本是很高的。\n\n所以大部分知识产权维权都是要么定点维权，比如找一家经济能力比较好的去搞一下，要么就是等他养肥了再宰。比如说 LegalDAO，虽然在国际上有一些影响力，但是肯定不大嘛，假如说 LegalDAO 损害了我著作权的话，我一看他也没挣钱，没什么支付能力，但是呢你侵害我著作权之后，你做起来了有支付能力了再来搞你，很多时候是这样一个性质。所以很难讲是一个完整的理想维权，大部分是出了事，而且是对方有经济能力才去维权。\n\n**MasterQ（DAO Builder/@blockmaniaDAO）**\n\n**除了 PFP 小图片类 NFT，文章、音乐、域名等其他类型的 NFT，有没有出现过类似版权的争议？版权归属认定的原则是通用的吗？**\n\n**七爷（Astrolegal合伙人律师/@victoryvictorz)**\n\n版权认定在每个国家不一样，国内认定方法分两种，要么你有公开发表，要么你有登记。在国内数藏里面，公开发表是比较常见的情况，大部分其实是没有做登记的，做登记基本都是为了维权目的。归根到底就是你之前有没有公开发表，来证明你是版权所有人，如果没有的话，就看这个作品最早源头，比如说 NFT 第一案里面，项目方要证明有没有从 IP 所有方获得知识产权，平台会要求有一个合同或者其他的凭证。\n\n**MasterQ（DAO Builder/@blockmaniaDAO）**\n\n**有越来越多的大品牌将 NFT 当做一种营销手段，比如李宁和 BAYC 之间的跨界联名，是不是意味着 NFT 除了原有的收藏价值和金融属性之外，商业变现的潜力在未来将会得到可观的开发？我们如何评判一个 NFT 的商业变现潜力？**\n\n**MasterLi（LegalDAO发起人/@MasterLHZ）**\n\n我觉得线下效应还是比较重要的。NFT 是不是有 Utility，不仅仅是说在社区里面享有什么权益，更代表了你可以拿去做点别的什么事情，比如说卖个衣服，做一下二创，对购买者来说手里面多了一样东西还挺好的。但是最重要是取决于主 IP 好不好，主 IP 有热度才有后面的这些可能性。所以说从商业的角度来讲，万变不离其宗，哪个项目炒得最火，哪个项目就有越多的可能性。\n\n**MasterQ（DAO Builder/@blockmaniaDAO）**\n\n**关于版权这个话题，目前大家最关注的点是什么?**\n\n**MasterLi（LegalDAO发起人/@MasterLHZ）**\n\n我自己觉得很有意思的一件事是，能不能把 NFT 流转和 IP 流转结合在一起。因为就像我刚才说的，NFT 只是商用的一种形式，跟 IP 流转其实是两回事，NFT 作为确权的东西，能够帮助艺术家、设计师流转他的 IP，让有一些人通过商用获得收益，在链上进行分成，这个我觉得是蛮有价值的，也是有这个需求的。\n\n这里面也包括比如我买了 BAYC ，我是一个普通人，又不开公司，就没法自己商用这个东西，那我就要授权给别人去商用，如果把 NFT 作为一项资产的话，我们看到大量把 NFT 质押、碎片化的金融化的方案，但是从 NFT 的本质来讲，如果有一套链上方案可以让版权给到能够商业化的人，挣钱之后还能得到应得的部分，当然这个技术难度还是挺大的，涉及到链上链下的东西。\n\n**七爷（Astrolegal合伙人律师/@victoryvictorz)**\n\nNFT 跟之前各种各样的币，一个显著的区别就是，币是跟物理世界机会隔绝的，它就像是一个元宇宙或者平行世界一样，链上发生所有事情除了让我们钱包的数额大小有变化之外，其他没有任何变化。但是 NFT 确实是联通线上特别是 web3 和线下一个很好地钥匙，它回归到 Token 这个词的本质，我们之前讨论过能不能把线下房产证做成链上证明，如果它做成 NFT，就没有人能够伪造了，后果就是你可能看到整个房产的流转过程。\n\n如果说一个作品，梵高那个时代有 NFT 的话，这哥们也不至于如此穷困潦倒那么长时间。他的作品是在去世后，商业价值才被利用起来。NFT 最好的就是，如果你在发行的时候用智能合约写清楚，每次流转过程，收益有百分之多少要归于最早的作者和版权方的，以这样一个形式发表 NFT，对于激励创作者经济是非常有好处的。因为我们经常看到现实世界的作品卖到几百万几千万，跟原作者一毛线关系都没有。\n\n所以我觉得关于 NFT 最需要讨论的就是，如何跟现实世界做更多关联，谁能想出来让 NFT 跟现实世界做关联的点子，一定都是个很好的创业项目。但是在国内要做这些事情，法律上的红线是千万不要做金融化的考虑，你都已经考虑做 NFT 了，就不要把它做成同质化的拆分，尽可能不要做这些事情。那这块的商业前景我觉得是非常可观的。\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1657166361, "digest": "V8N1TJ5KF7IgOOEQxuGbwYz0cINrOCFc-nbp1Psi_S0", "contributor": "0xb5CDd8a3b6BEf7aA35763c79779Fe80FeE2c9C4B"}

I am my number, my number is me.\n\nRecently, I have seen some chaos in the ENS market driven by the founders of the 10K Club Discord community: they register some non-34D domain names in advance, and then take advantage of the rise in 34D prices to hype and fool other people into buying these non-34D names at high price to make profits. In addition, they had tried to betray the community and suppressed other 34D builders during the period.\n\nNow, I decided to disclose some stories about them and some of their misbehavior after careful consideration, hoping to make everyone more vigilant and rational.\n\n**Misbehavior 1: Intention of betraying the 10K community**\n\nAs an NFT researcher, when the 10K concept of ENS was first born, I thought it was very interesting, so I did an in-depth study of it. At the same time, I also met some ENS enthusiasts and programmers through the Discord community of 10K Club. Everyone saw the potential of 34D and bought and firmly held 34D. At the same time, we also want to use our own expertise to empower 34D and increase the value of 34D.\n\nHowever, we are not good at community operation, so we hope to cooperate with the founders of 10K Club in DC group, and let them run the community. We are responsible for research and development, and provide more benefits to 34D holders.\n\nIn early May, we made plans: first, we applied patented technology to establish the website www.10kmap.io for 34D holders; Second, we planned to create a NFT trading platform: [www.10kuni.io](http://www.10kuni.io/) to improve the 34D transaction experience, and gradually empower 34D.\n\nHowever, the DC group founders of 10K Club (such as 260.eth, aox.eth, oneill.eth) are not interested in our plan to empower 34D. And because of the wide dissemination of a Chinese article \" Why 4digits ENS domain name will definitely become the BAYC in the domain name field- written by a 28-year-old Chinese billionaire\", they guessed that I was the Chinese billionaire. So, when I discussed cooperation with them and wanted to empower 34D together, they wanted to make money by selling out the whole community to me.\n\nHere's the reply from 260.eth on Discord, they said they don't care what the 34D supporters are up to, and if we need the community, they can sell it to us for 1000ETH ($2.8 million at the time)! This money can buy over 500 4Ds!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VGKDq9rnj8ffsmWMCL2b2.png?height=165&width=865)\n\nLater, they think that 500ETH is also OK when they realized 1000ETH is not realistic.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LqkZTH9JrKWGDoyFsSVnB.png?height=80&width=865)\n\nI admire their preview. At that time, the 10K Club community had less than 7,000 members, and they saw the huge potential of the community. At the same time, I also think it is very absurd and bizarre. It turns out that they have never thought about making some contributions to the development of 34D, but thinking about how to make profits from 34D all the time. The three founders of 10k club,260.eth, aox.eth, 713.eth (now called oneill.eth) have sold out most of their 34D names\n\nLater, I tried to communicate with them again to build 10k club, but they didn’t show any interest. 260.eth didn’t respond to my advice.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/agkVNI-7qJeRlKHh1ANM6.png?height=345&width=865)\n\naox.eth blacklisted me after some rude reply to me.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6EiqaQlCV4DPqfwtYmsWU.png?height=813&width=633)\n\n713\\.eth even taught me how to make profits through this.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gFJQbXlwzvylZtYxjHQM6.png?height=746&width=607)\n\nThis was my reply to him\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DHXw8VF7-pBS0pjaR84sj.png?height=422&width=626)\n\nIn the end, many community members and me had to build another 10K community. However, at that time, I thought 34D was in the early stages of development, and there was no need to speak out about their ugly behaviors, which I think would lead to the division of the community (Now I realized what a terrible mistake I’ve made, and it has brought huge losses to other community members because they are cheated).\n\n**Misbehavior 2: Suppress other 34D builders**\n\nWith the technical team working day and night, the club website www.10kmap.io was officially launched on Bitcoin Pizza Day. At the same time, we established the DC community of 10K Universe. Voluntarily donated by community members, we took out 5 4D domain names and 7.5ETH to carry out activities to encourage everyone to familiarize themselves with the operation of ENS. In the first round of activities, our slogan was \"Giving out 4D domain names worth 500 ETH\". the reason for such a slogan is that we think the price of 4D will rise to the level of 100E like BAYC in the future, and the other is to mock the 3 founders of 10K Club who wanted to sell 10K community for 500ETH.\n\nAfter that, we also encourage everyone to pay attention to and get involved in the development of 34D and provide them with some benefits. However, when the 3 founders found that 10K Universe became popular, and 34D holders gradually joined 10K Universe, which might harm their interests because they they still want to cheat community members by promoting other non-34D names.\n\nThen they found a 10K CLUB Mod, 3070.eth, who publicly slandered 10K Universe for spending money on robot fans, and found so-called \"evidence\".\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/96Gx-JmYYeeNpdAasbkQx.png?height=154&width=865)\n\nThe picture above is the explanation I gave him. During that time, the number of community members only increased by a few hundred, and it was because of the Chinese KOLs who helped us promote it. Because the community that 10K Universe community volunteer Hanz participated in and managed before has been attacked by robots, he was worried that a robot would join the community, and even manually banned more than 100 accounts (the entire community was merely more than 1,000 members at that time), but because of this, many real users are blocked by mistake.\n\nSo I want 3070.eth to show his evidence to see if there are real bots, and I DM him, but he hasn't replied yet, then he directly banned me in 10K CLUB for 7 days!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3j4rkmBFFU2Yb7u4z1s-c.png?height=527&width=865)\n\nThe behavior of these people really hurts me. Since then, I have never showed up in the DC group of 10K Club.\n\n**Misbehavior 3:  Register some domain names in advance and sell them to community members at a high price**\n\nRecently, the price of 34D has just improved for several days, and they started to cheat people again by registering non-34D domain names in advance. Then, headed by 260.eth, they replaced their avatars with Arabic headscarves on Twitter, changed their Twitter names to Arabic names, and encouraged other users to make changes as well. They intended to make profits again by advocating Arabic digital domain names and hyping Chinese digital domain names. They may probably think that Arabs and Chinese people are rich and stupid to buy these names.\n\nOnce, the 10K Club community also initiated a vote to delete all other channels that are not 34D domain names! But later they hyped these non-34D names and sold them to users at high price!\n\nThis is the link of proposal to remove other channels in 10k club\n\n[https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e](https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e)\n\n260\\.eth changed avatar with hijab and changed his twitter name. I wonder if he knows the proper way to wear the hijab and what it means.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DUATXpaIY6MEHb8WiMgY1.png?height=636&width=865)\n\nArabic numeric domain names are frequently promoted by him on Twitter.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5f5BmtysBTvixcmG2BMWR.png?height=1285&width=865)\n\nRecently he turned to promotion of other categories of domain names.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V1KmiwgalhtGCQ0i4YsKR.png?height=655&width=865)\n\nI hope all users will not be cheated by him. I think once people buy it, they will have less money in their wallets.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gsVNYejbKFKc-3voZggBw.png?height=1201&width=865)\n\nhe registered these names and tried to sell them quickly, which proves that he just wants to make profits from these names.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k5t_ulaFDR0T_eFogk4mR.png?height=265&width=865)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eOWOWAYHWXVH8UQqrH6rE.png?height=439&width=865)\n\nAt the same time he is still registering new domain names\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XIxlVWxooZHOmGnr8yCjO.png?height=495&width=865)\n\nPlease notice that this is just his public account. He might have other private wallets we don’t know. I hope all community members can keep their eyes open, stay reasonable, and don't be cheated by others. I also hope that 34D holders will not lose confidence in 34D because of some people’s misbehavior. As a blue chip in the future Web3 identity, the future of 34D will still be bright. We still have a strong 10K Universe community that will continue to empower 34D and entitled them with interesting and valuable scenes.\n\nI also warn 260.eth and others to stop doing such things that harm the interests of the community for personal interests! I will bear the full burden of proof and guarantee the authenticity of the above statements.If 260.eth and others continue to violate the interests of the community, I will further expose it on my personal Twitter.\n\n[https://twitter.com/web3saltman](https://twitter.com/web3saltman)\n\nAt present, there are still many 10K Builders that are constantly promoting and adding value to 34D, please be confident and pay attention to the development of 34D. We also welcome everyone who holds 34D to join the 10K Universe community and build a stronger 10K community with a brighter future.\n\nLinks of 10k community: <https://linktr.ee/10kuniverse>\n\nThe followings are the builders of our 10k community, the list maybe incomplete and we welcome newcomers to join us:\n\n5660\\.eth; 550.eth; 8249.eth; 8975.eth；139.eth；366.eth；5552.eth；0377.eth；5666.eth；789.eth；2789.eth；5655.eth; 2111.eth", "timestamp": 1657167024, "digest": "KdXUiYcFFXfGaKyxtjz1cTC_pgHVnMMVX_raxX82gos", "contributor": "0x648E7865bDfAC56c0233a9999206867725ecE54D"}

{"id": "ATkF_2HEgpMSGzvVe18KGKIYS42o02p3OoTdu0KVgZs", "title": "致10K社区成员的公开信", "body": "各位34D持有者、10K Universe建设者、关心ENS发展的朋友们\n\n大家好！\n\n我是5660.eth，我是我的数字，我的数字是我。\n\n最近看到ENS市场中一些由10K Club Discord社群创始人等带动的乱象：他们通过抢先注册一些非34D数字域名，然后借34D价格上涨之机，大肆宣传，忽悠其他人高价买入从而谋取不正当利益。此外，他们之前还曾意图出卖社区，并在期间打压其他34D建设者。\n\n经过慎重思考，我决定将背后的一些故事以及他们的一些不良行为讲出来，希望能让大家提高警惕，保持理性。\n\n声明：本人将对以下陈述负全部举证责任并保证真实性。\n\n**行径一：意图出卖社区**\n\n作为NFT研究员，在ENS的10K概念刚诞生的时候，我认为非常有趣，于是便对它进行了深入研究。同时，通过10K Club的Discord社群，我也结识了一些ENS深度爱好者和技术大佬。大家都看到了34D的潜力，买入并坚定持有了34D。同时，我们也想利用自身的特长，为34D赋能，增加34D的价值。\n\n但是，我所认识的这些持有者，技术和研究人员偏多，比如有加密货币交易所的研究员、知名NFT的核心开发人员、上市公司的前技术总监等。\n\n我们并不擅长社群运营，于是就希望与10K Club的DC群创始人合作，由他们运营社群，我们负责研究和开发，一起为34D赋能，给34D持有者提供更多福利。\n\n五月初我们做了规划：一是应用专利技术，建立10kmap.io，为34D持有者提供便利，并逐渐发展成一个统一元宇宙；二是做一个精选的NFT交易平台（10kuni.io，待发布），集成一些NFT研究成果，提高34D交易体验，并逐渐给34D赋能。\n\n但是，事与愿违。10K Club的DC群创始人们（如260.eth, aox.eth，oneill.eth）对10K Builder给34D赋能的计划并不感兴趣。而又由于那段时间有一篇中文文章《一名28岁的普通A9+讲述：为什么4digits ENS域名一定会成为域名领域的无聊猿》在海内外的广泛传播，而我是中国人，并积极推动给34D赋能，他们猜测我就是那个身家A9的中国富豪。于是，在我和他们讨论合作，想一起为34D赋能时，他们却想通过出卖社区赚取一大笔资金。\n\n以下是260.eth的回复，他们说他们不关心34D支持者们要做什么，如果我们需要社群，他们可以以1000ETH（当时折合价格为280万美元）的价格卖给我们！这可以买超过500个4D！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y1h1EsEWUZmSg4v7eB8XI.png?height=165&width=865)\n\n后来可能自己也认为自己穷疯了，不太好意思，降价到500ETH。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OrWVL_pO5b9eqIbeAc7pw.png?height=80&width=865)\n\n我很佩服他们的眼光，当时10K Club社群不足7000人，他们就看到了社群巨大的价值潜力（如果他们如今已经完成了社区出卖，请社区成员找他索要属于你的那一份，毕竟你也是其中的7000分之一）。同时，我也觉得十分荒诞离奇，原来他们始终都没有想着为34D做一些贡献，而是想着从中收割，谋取不正当的私利。\n\n三个创始人，260.eth,aox.eth，713.eth(现在叫oneill.eth)，我反复和他们进行了沟通。\n\n我认为10K这个概念不错，大家也都是持有者（后来发现，原来只有我们是持有者，而他们已经卖出了自己手中大部分的34D，非常讽刺），能够发挥自己所长，一起做好一件事就完美了。但没想到这些人格局这么差，提出了上述令人作呕的方案。\n\n后来其他10K Builder就建议我单独建立一个社区。而我当时仍然一直认为我们都应该为34D赋能，没必要再去建一个社区，从而导致社区分裂，一起将10K Club做好就很好了。为此我还想了折中方案，并给他们都一一发送了消息，近乎低三下四地去和他们沟通。\n\n260\\.eth直接不再回复。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LhLww1MsyCshus_DpO46P.png?height=345&width=865)\n\n以下是aox.eth回复（是的，我得到了fucked）,并拉黑了我。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SJCbICXlSVSWEJ9yDeQjN.png?height=813&width=633)\n\n713\\.eth还直接教我怎么割韭菜了，显然深谙其中道理，呵呵。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyGW0bFNYWHnoouQKfypM.png?height=746&width=607)\n\n这是我对他的回复\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SyzjolmaAyzqVOjzzpuhY.png?height=422&width=626)\n\n最终我和很多社区成员也非常无奈，只能选择逐渐再建立一个社区。但是，当时我认为34D在发展早期，没有必要把他们这些丑陋行径说出来，导致社区分裂（我现在才知道我的善良带来了多大的失误，使得他们继续从中谋取不正当利益，给社区成员造成了巨大的损失）。\n\n**行径二：打压其他34D建设者**\n\n在技术团队的没日没夜工作下，比特币披萨节当天，俱乐部网站10kmap.io正式上线。同时我们成立了10K Universe的DC社群。由社区成员志愿捐献，我们拿出了5个4D域名以及7.5ETH开展活动，鼓励大家熟悉ENS的操作。第一轮活动中，我们的宣传口号是“价值500ETH的4D域名赠送”的原因，其一是认为未来4D价格也许能像无聊猿一样，涨到100E的水平，另外也是嘲讽10K Club DC创始人想以500ETH价格将 DC社区成员出卖这件事。\n\n之后，我们也会去10K CLUB 的DC群发一些动态，让大家关注项目发展，鼓励大家参与活动，也能获得一些福利。但是，当他们发现10K Universe热度起来了，有34D持有者逐渐加入了10K Universe，这可能不利于他们将来割韭菜了，哈哈。\n\n然后他们可能就找了一个10K CLUB管理员，3070.eth，在10K Club社群内公开污蔑10K Universe花钱买机器人粉丝之类，并拿出了所谓的“证据”。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GvSLUPyu-FHwcIIU5teLn.png?height=154&width=865)\n\n我对他进行了反驳，以上是我给他的解释。那段时间社区成员仅增长了几百人，而且是因为有中国的KOL帮我们进行了宣传。因为10K Universe社区志愿者Hanz之前参与管理过的社群曾遭受过机器人攻击，他担心有机器人加入社群，甚至手动封禁了100多个账户（那时候整个社群人数才1000多人），反而因此误封了很多真实用户。\n\n所以我想让3070.eth拿出他的证据来源，看是不是存在机器人。于是，我私聊了他，而他至今都没有回复，但却直接在10K CLUB将我禁言了7天！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NOIjr9Ediwa3isTH1TQ6m.png?height=527&width=865)\n\n这些人的行为实在让我伤心透了。从此之后，我就再也没去10K Club的DC群说过一句话。\n\n**行径三：违背社区投票结果，抢先注册一些域名，并通过宣传，意图高价卖给社区成员**\n\n虽然他们的举动让我受了一些委屈，但本来想着也没必要说出这些事情，占用公共资源。而且，之前关注到他们的账户，他们基本也把自己手里的34D都卖光了，想必该消停点了。没想到最近34D的价格刚有点起色，他们又开始动歪心思了，悄悄注册了某些品类的域名。然后，以260.eth为首，在推特更换带有阿拉伯头巾的头像，修改自己的推特名字，并鼓励不知情的其他用户也进行修改，通过鼓吹阿拉伯语数字域名和炒作中文数字域名等，意图进一步地割韭菜。炒作阿拉伯语数字域名和中文数字域名，难道不是因为他们认为阿拉伯人和中国人人傻钱多？\n\n要知道，曾经10K Club社群还发起过投票，删除了所有非34D域名的其他频道！而他们和少数人居然为了自己的利益，违背社区的投票结果，公开宣传34D以外的域名，从而高价卖给被蒙骗的用户！\n\n删除其他频道的提案和目的\n\n[https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e](https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e)\n\n260\\.eth更换了戴有阿拉伯头巾的头像，并更改了推特名字\n\n我想知道他是否清楚阿拉伯头巾的正确佩戴方法及含义。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjN7CjsNnhG1OcGmSYR5-.png?height=636&width=865)\n\n在推特频繁宣传阿拉伯语数字域名。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RAvL6nsHZ0ZRy4Fwju-xu.png?height=1285&width=865)\n\n最近又转向对其他域名的宣传\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/exUZK-8QY9FvfO5brxg13.png?height=655&width=865)\n\n我想人们一旦购买了它，他们钱包中的资金将会减少。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xYKk08zTeN_vQM3tcSMPi.png?height=1201&width=865)\n\n于此同时，他却提前注册，并试图高价出售这些他非常看好的域名。既然如此坚定看好，为什么你却以如此低的价格出售？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZIAf8PHcAUojOJpjkhY1_.png?height=265&width=865)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kVbRaGQI6Ti3eHqhGXa1_.png?height=439&width=865)\n\n同时他仍在不断注册新的域名\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7kTKm1WLG6DAp5d5RuErv.png?height=495&width=865)\n\n请注意，这还只是他的公开账号。当你看到一只蟑螂在地板上乱窜时，很可能还有很多只蟑螂藏在冰箱后面或者水槽下面。\n\n他们这些行为让我感到不舒服。因此，我决定将这背后的故事讲出来，交给社区去评判。希望社区成员能够擦亮眼睛，保持理智，不要被少数人蒙骗，进而损失资金。也希望34D持有者不要因为个别人的行径，就对34D丧失信心，作为未来的Web3身份中的蓝筹，它的未来价值也不会受到个别社群成员不良行为的影响。而我们依然有着强大的10K Universe社区，将会为34D不断增加新的有趣又有价值的场景。\n\n我始终认为，君子爱财，取之有道，在此也正告260.eth等人，不要再做一些通过伤害社区利益而谋取个人私利的事情了！本人将对以上陈述负全部举证责任并保证真实性。如果260.eth等人，仍然继续侵害社区利益，我将在我个人推特进一步揭露。\n\n[https://twitter.com/web3saltman](https://twitter.com/web3saltman)\n\n目前，仍有很多

{"id": "zEIpck0Br5OxBhQFwfndatUXjrFN7JiJCDkh_bkc07k", "title": "A letter to all 34D holders in 10K Club", "body": "Dear 34D holders, 10K Universe builders, friends who care about the development of ENS\n\nI am 5660.eth. I am my number, my number is me.\n\nRecently, I have seen some chaos in the ENS market driven by the founders of the 10K Club Discord community: they register some non-34D domain names in advance, and then take advantage of the rise in 34D prices to hype and fool other people into buying these non-34D names at high price to make profits. In addition, they had tried to betray the community and suppressed other 34D builders during the period.\n\nNow, I decided to disclose some stories about them and some of their misbehavior after careful consideration, hoping to make everyone more vigilant and rational.\n\n**Misbehavior 1: Intention of betraying the 10K community**\n\nAs an NFT researcher, when the 10K concept of ENS was first born, I thought it was very interesting, so I did an in-depth study of it. At the same time, I also met some ENS enthusiasts and programmers through the Discord community of 10K Club. Everyone saw the potential of 34D and bought and firmly held 34D. At the same time, we also want to use our own expertise to empower 34D and increase the value of 34D.\n\nHowever, we are not good at community operation, so we hope to cooperate with the founders of 10K Club in DC group, and let them run the community. We are responsible for research and development, and provide more benefits to 34D holders.\n\nIn early May, we made plans: first, we applied patented technology to establish the website www.10kmap.io for 34D holders; Second, we planned to create a NFT trading platform: [www.10kuni.io](http://www.10kuni.io/) to improve the 34D transaction experience, and gradually empower 34D.\n\nHowever, the DC group founders of 10K Club (such as 260.eth, aox.eth, oneill.eth) are not interested in our plan to empower 34D. And because of the wide dissemination of a Chinese article \" Why 4digits ENS domain name will definitely become the BAYC in the domain name field- written by a 28-year-old Chinese billionaire\", they guessed that I was the Chinese billionaire. So, when I discussed cooperation with them and wanted to empower 34D together, they wanted to make money by selling out the whole community to me.\n\nHere's the reply from 260.eth on Discord, they said they don't care what the 34D supporters are up to, and if we need the community, they can sell it to us for 1000ETH ($2.8 million at the time)! This money can buy over 500 4Ds!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VGKDq9rnj8ffsmWMCL2b2.png?height=165&width=865)\n\nLater, they think that 500ETH is also OK when they realized 1000ETH is not realistic.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LqkZTH9JrKWGDoyFsSVnB.png?height=80&width=865)\n\nI admire their preview. At that time, the 10K Club community had less than 7,000 members, and they saw the huge potential of the community. At the same time, I also think it is very absurd and bizarre. It turns out that they have never thought about making some contributions to the development of 34D, but thinking about how to make profits from 34D all the time. The three founders of 10k club,260.eth, aox.eth, 713.eth (now called oneill.eth) have sold out most of their 34D names\n\nLater, I tried to communicate with them again to build 10k club, but they didn’t show any interest. 260.eth didn’t respond to my advice.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/agkVNI-7qJeRlKHh1ANM6.png?height=345&width=865)\n\naox.eth blacklisted me after some rude reply to me.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6EiqaQlCV4DPqfwtYmsWU.png?height=813&width=633)\n\n713\\.eth even taught me how to make profits through this.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gFJQbXlwzvylZtYxjHQM6.png?height=746&width=607)\n\nThis was my reply to him\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DHXw8VF7-pBS0pjaR84sj.png?height=422&width=626)\n\nIn the end, many community members and me had to build another 10K community. However, at that time, I thought 34D was in the early stages of development, and there was no need to speak out about their ugly behaviors, which I think would lead to the division of the community (Now I realized what a terrible mistake I’ve made, and it has brought huge losses to other community members because they are cheated).\n\n**Misbehavior 2: Suppress other 34D builders**\n\nWith the technical team working day and night, the club website www.10kmap.io was officially launched on Bitcoin Pizza Day. At the same time, we established the DC community of 10K Universe. Voluntarily donated by community members, we took out 5 4D domain names and 7.5ETH to carry out activities to encourage everyone to familiarize themselves with the operation of ENS. In the first round of activities, our slogan was \"Giving out 4D domain names worth 500 ETH\". the reason for such a slogan is that we think the price of 4D will rise to the level of 100E like BAYC in the future, and the other is to mock the 3 founders of 10K Club who wanted to sell 10K community for 500ETH.\n\nAfter that, we also encourage everyone to pay attention to and get involved in the development of 34D and provide them with some benefits. However, when the 3 founders found that 10K Universe became popular, and 34D holders gradually joined 10K Universe, which might harm their interests because they they still want to cheat community members by promoting other non-34D names.\n\nThen they found a 10K CLUB Mod, 3070.eth, who publicly slandered 10K Universe for spending money on robot fans, and found so-called \"evidence\".\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/96Gx-JmYYeeNpdAasbkQx.png?height=154&width=865)\n\nThe picture above is the explanation I gave him. During that time, the number of community members only increased by a few hundred, and it was because of the Chinese KOLs who helped us promote it. Because the community that 10K Universe community volunteer Hanz participated in and managed before has been attacked by robots, he was worried that a robot would join the community, and even manually banned more than 100 accounts (the entire community was merely more than 1,000 members at that time), but because of this, many real users are blocked by mistake.\n\nSo I want 3070.eth to show his evidence to see if there are real bots, and I DM him, but he hasn't replied yet, then he directly banned me in 10K CLUB for 7 days!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3j4rkmBFFU2Yb7u4z1s-c.png?height=527&width=865)\n\nThe behavior of these people really hurts me. Since then, I have never showed up in the DC group of 10K Club.\n\n**Misbehavior 3:  Register some domain names in advance and sell them to community members at a high price**\n\nRecently, the price of 34D has just improved for several days, and they started to cheat people again by registering non-34D domain names in advance. Then, headed by 260.eth, they replaced their avatars with Arabic headscarves on Twitter, changed their Twitter names to Arabic names, and encouraged other users to make changes as well. They intended to make profits again by advocating Arabic digital domain names and hyping Chinese digital domain names. They may probably think that Arabs and Chinese people are rich and stupid to buy these names.\n\nOnce, the 10K Club community also initiated a vote to delete all other channels that are not 34D domain names! But later they hyped these non-34D names and sold them to users at high price!\n\nThis is the link of proposal to remove other channels in 10k club\n\n[https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e](https://snapshot.org/#/10kclub.eth/proposal/0x3d0d6a60e55853e6af9d05ebd699cc94179392e8eba87ef5ca22fd761506a09e)\n\n260\\.eth changed avatar with hijab and changed his twitter name. I wonder if he knows the proper way to wear the hijab and what it means.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DUATXpaIY6MEHb8WiMgY1.png?height=636&width=865)\n\nArabic numeric domain names are frequently promoted by him on Twitter.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5f5BmtysBTvixcmG2BMWR.png?height=1285&width=865)\n\nRecently he turned to promotion of other categories of domain names.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V1KmiwgalhtGCQ0i4YsKR.png?height=655&width=865)\n\nI hope all users will not be cheated by him.

He might have other private wallets we don’t know. I hope all community members can keep their eyes open, stay reasonable, and don't be cheated by others. I also hope that 34D holders will not lose confidence in 34D because of some people’s misbehavior. As a blue chip in the future Web3 identity, the future of 34D will still be bright. We still have a strong 10K Universe community that will continue to empower 34D and entitled them with interesting and valuable scenes.\n\nI also warn 260.eth and others to stop doing such things that harm the interests of the community for personal interests! I will bear the full burden of proof and guarantee the authenticity of the above statements.If 260.eth and others continue to violate the interests of the community, I will further expose it on my personal Twitter.\n\n[https://twitter.com/web3saltman](https://twitter.com/web3saltman)\n\nAt present, there are still many 10K Builders that are constantly promoting and adding value to 34D, please be confident and pay attention to the development of 34D. We also welcome everyone who holds 34D to join the 10K Universe community and build a stronger 10K community with a brighter future.\n\nLinks of 10k community: <https://linktr.ee/10kuniverse>\n\nThe followings are the builders of our 10k community, the list maybe incomplete and we welcome newcomers to join us:\n\n5660\\.eth; 550.eth; 8249.eth; 8975.eth；139.eth；366.eth；5552.eth；0377.eth；5666.eth；789.eth；2789.eth；5655.eth; 2111.eth", "timestamp": 1657169568, "digest": "KdXUiYcFFXfGaKyxtjz1cTC_pgHVnMMVX_raxX82gos", "contributor": "0x648E7865bDfAC56c0233a9999206867725ecE54D"}
