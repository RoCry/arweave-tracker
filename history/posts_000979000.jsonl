"虽然市场比较低迷，新项目出现频率在显著降低。但NFT市场仍然热闹，Opensea上每天都会有大量新NFT项目出现，同时也会有大量的玩家在其中碰运气淘金。\n\n但在这种表面的热闹后，实际上目前NFT市场存在一些不可忽视的问题：首先，NFT的质量得不到保证。Opensea上的NFT没有发行门槛也不需要背书，围绕一种流行趋势可以立刻出现多个NFT仿盘；此外，你拿到NFT也只能被动等待升值，而不能对这个NFT做太多主动操作。\n\n面对这些问题，是否存在另一种平台，使发售的NFT有优质IP背书，而不至于稍有不慎就会掉进仿盘；同时，如果我们可以针对平台上的NFT，进行二次创作并分享其中的收益，让原IP的衍生价值更大。\n\n今天我们要讲的项目CRIPCO，就是一个结合NFT有条件发行、鼓励用户二次创作以及具备良好交易体验的NFT平台，且即将于7月8日在FTX进行IE0。\n\n考虑到FTX去年仅仅进行了5场IE0，能够得到FTX官方的严选和认可，也从侧面印证了该项目可能蕴含的价值。而CRIPCO与Opensea等到底有何不同，产品设计和经济模型如何，我们将在本文中进行深入分析。\n\n通证：IP3（暂未发布）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6UxTnQE6hY0gfKwE8lOHN.png?height=626&width=1080)\n\nCRIPCO是什么\n\n基于Solana的NFT交易和创作平台\n\nCRIPCO是一个基于Solana的NFT平台，之后也会拓展到Polygon和Flow网络上。而它的产品主要由DAO、NFT创作工具和交易市场组成。下面我们将逐个进行详细介绍。\n\nCRIPCO DAO，由懂行大咖把控NFT质量\n\n在Opensea等NFT平台上，任何人都可以发行NFT。但这种自由并非没有代价：一个NFT项目经常衍生出各种仿盘，且质量参差不齐，也容易让新手难辨真假。\n\n在CRIPCO的设计思路里，NFT不能随意由任何人发行上架。因此CRIPCO成立了一个DAO组织来对提交的NFT项目进行审核，并决策哪些NFT项目可以上架。而这种决策权的背后，必须要有懂行的人来做支撑。目前DAO的成员基本都来自音乐、美术、时装、玩具等与IP和潮流强相关的知名公司。从公开资料来看，其中也包括了我们耳熟能详的藤原浩和陈冠希。\n\n这些成员在自己的业务领域里，已具备了一定的审美和把握潮流趋势的能力，因此可以对进入CRIPCO的NFT项目的质量进行把控。同时，DAO成员们依赖自己的行业影响力，也可以将自己的IP带入NFT项目中，这也将有利于CRIPCO早期的启动并获得大量用户关注。\n\n在DAO具体的决策规则上，一个NFT项目发起后，如果投票权重加起来超过20%的人同意，或者总人数的三分之二都同意，那么这个NFT项目就可以被同意发行；相应地，DAO成员也可以通过投票的方式来决策某些不活跃、侵权的NFT项目会被下架，但具体的投票比例现在仍未公布。\n\n而在规则实际的操作上，CRIPCO DAO运用了一个策展智能合约（Curation Contract）来执行NFT项目提交--投票--决策--发布/拒绝的过程：\n\n用户在Solana上发布希望上架的NFT合约；\n\nNFT合约地址开始被DAO的合约调用；\n\nDAO成员对拟创建的NFT合约进行响应，并依据内容做出投票；\n\n按照前述人数/权重规则决定投票结果，投票通过的话该NFT地址会加入到通过审核的NFT集里。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P0vKZO82ER7lq6Ibgirg2.png?height=1280&width=966)\n\n此外，DAO成员还可以共同决策功能的升级（如跨链和投票机制更改）和金库的管理等，这部分与其他DAO比较类似，我们在此不做过多的讲解和说明。目前CRIPCO DAO还未正式公开运作，但从上述决策设计来看，相当于打造了一种半封闭化的NFT上架模式：提交权给所有人，但决策权仅对DAO成员开放。\n\n从保护NFT的质量和版权的角度来看，这种设计能起到很好的过滤作用，但实际的运行效率则有待于产品上线后检验。\n\n多样的创作工具，由创作者扩展NFT二创经济\n\n一般情况下，你持有PFP类的NFT后就只能被动的等待NFT的升值；而对于权益类NFT，持有也能享受后续的空投和获得某些活动的入场券等... 但这些实际上都是“被动型获得”：你并不能主动对这个NFT做什么。\n\n而在传统的影视和游戏领域，我们经常会看到一些粉丝的同人作品：在原作或原型的基础上主动进行再创作的活动。但这种主动创作目前在NFT领域还不够健全，比如哥布林NFT大火后，哥布林女孩等NFT也层出不穷，但普通用户由于缺乏对应的技能和工具，很难参与到二次创作中，也很难分享创作的收益。\n\n面对这个问题，CRIPCO将会提供一套完善的制作工具，使得无论是个人还是企业都可以轻松的制作NFT。这其中包括支持动作捕捉、网络漫画制作、按需打印、贴纸设计、背景图片设计等，使得用户在购买了某个NFT后，能够进行二次创作。我们可以把原NFT理解成一张图片，而二创之后的图片就像是各类表情包，在扩展了原图的使用范围的同时，也被赋予了更多更有趣的功能。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yPdNPXC8mED2l_18Xz7rQ.png?height=276&width=1080)\n\n值得一提的是，使用CRIPCO提供的工具进行二次创作之后，其作品仍然是一个NFT。用户也可以将二创的NFT进行出售以获取收益。此外，根据FTX的调研报告显示，通过SSO技术（Single Sign-on，单一登入），原NFT和二创NFT可以实现在不同元宇宙同步NFT产权。这项设计让CRIPCO成为了NFT购买、设计的枢纽，并让用户自定义线上身份的NFT。这样的设计下，NFT不再是静态的文件，更多起到了IP价值放大器的作用。\n\n更低的交易费用，配套分析工具\n\n作为NFT平台，用户最直观也最在意的必然是交易的成本和体验。下表展示了主流的NFT交易平台的手续费用，Opensea的手续费达到了2.5%，Magic Eden和LooksRare为2%，而CRIPCO设计的手续费是1%。\n\n此外，由于上架模式的区别，理论上CRIPCO上的NFT多以大IP为主，而相对高质量的NFT，对应的手续费却是几个平台之间最低的。这种设计确实具有一定的吸引力，但是否所有的用户都会追逐大IP，以及用户的使用习惯是否会因手续费低而扭转，目前尚不能给出定论。例如LooksRare上还有挂单挖矿的逻辑，用户交易NFT会得到分成，这也是吸引用户留在原平台的手段。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4nrGRsRmXe4D4OAn0kFaO.png?height=430&width=794)\n\n同时，CRIPCO也计划推出收藏品竞标、批量交易、数据仪表板（例如上市比、蓝筹 NFT持有者比例、巨鲸持有数量、NFT价格和交易量）等功能，让用户在交易决策和操作时更加方便。目前NFT市场的数据分析主要集中在第三方网站上（如NFTgo, acnft等），如果NFT交易平台能够自带分析工具，对用户来说会有更加无缝的操作体验，一站式的完成NFT市场的分析、决策和交易。\n\n为了方便大家理解，我们也可以用一张图来总结CRIPCO的产品设计：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WFzW8ivRRgN0qUj9h-OQi.png?height=705&width=1080)\n\n经济模型\n\nIP3和IPD分别作为功能通证和治理通证\n\n在通证设计上，CRIPCO有两种通证，IP3和IPD。前者是项目的功能通证，主要用于CRIPCO平台日常的NFT交易和结算；后者是治理通证，与DAO的投票权和治理权相关。我们可以用下面这张表具体的解释两种通证的作用和相互关系：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6j7cABPoDMTW_GFwZRu8k.png?height=630&width=1080)\n\n实际上，IP3和IPD贯穿了CRIPCO的NFT发布、创作、策展、决策和交易的各个环节，通过通证的激励作用引导参与者的行为，最终会形成一个有利于平台发展的正循环：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p_O9ROUOhREfqVsPY-iyZ.png?height=656&width=1080)\n\n但需要注意的是，虽然CRIPCO采用了双通证的设计，但IPD是由IP3转换而来，市场上首先TGE的是IP3，因此我们需要着重分析IP3的释放规则和解锁周期。\n\nIP3的总量被设计为3亿个，从功能上看，其中50%将用于流动性奖励，分发给未来对CRIPCO DAO的贡献者（但具体如何分配目前未说明）；18%将作为奖励分发给IPD的质押者，即上表我们提到的IP3定期空投。而从早期投资者和团队持仓来看，团队、顾问、两轮私募的投资者都持有5%的IP3，但均在12-18个月后线性解锁。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Sys_uyHvJJI0Laaf58wnx.png?height=753&width=1080)\n\n目前能够公开获取到IP3的渠道，也仅有公募IE0轮次（仅1%比例）。7月8日，CRIPCO的IE0将在FTX进行。今年到现在，FTX只举办了3次IE0，因此CRIPCO的IE0仍具备一定的稀缺性和价值。但目前的市场走熊，IE0的效果是否会达到预期，则是见仁见智的事情。而参与IE0也需要质押FTT，不同的质押大小对应的中签几率也不同，感兴趣的玩家可以通过FTX的介绍页面了解更多本次活动的详情。\n\n链接：<https://ftx.com/cripco-ieo>\n\nCripco的资方和团队\n\nCRIPCO目前得到了FTX Ventures和SOLANA Ventures等机构的投资，虽然目前暂未披露具体的融资金额信息，但结合FTX之前试图收购Blockfi的意图，以及SOLANA打造智能手机的规划可以看出，二者目前的资金状况应该比较良好，同时也在谋求更多赛道上的布局。\n\nFTX和SOLANA的扶持将对CRIPCO后续的发展起到推动作用：优质机构的背书、丰富的资源将会让平台连接更多有价值的人和IP，对于做大平台的网络效应和知名度来说至关重要。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ll8Xyv7dvHrSTwTcyEoDI.png?height=435&width=1080)\n\n而在团队方面，CRIPCO的官网显示创始团队均来自于韩国。从CEO的履历来看，之前曾在三星和IPX的营销岗位上工作了10年以上。其中三星作为知名电子品牌不用过多描述，而IPX可能大家比较陌生。但如果提起Line Friends和下图中的小熊形象，相信都会立刻产生熟悉感。在今年2月Line Friends宣布将业务重点转向数字IP、NFT和元宇宙，并将公司名称更名为IPX。\n\n因此我们可以认为，这是知名IP潮流公司转型WEB3业务的一次尝试，而Line Friends作为顶级IP，极有可能在CRIPCO发展初期，通过启动各类NFT营销活动进行造势和宣传。这种团队自带IP入场的玩法有利于项目启动，另一方面也可以通过之前的工作经验和资源吸引其他的优质IP加入。\n\n例如文章开头提到的，在CRIPCO DAO中成员基本都来自音乐、美术、时装、玩具等与IP和潮流强相关的知名公司，在把控提交的NFT质量同时，也可以自带IP入场结合NFT制造更多的话题和玩法。对于NFT来说，建立文化和叙事至关重要，而CRIOCO已有的资源则可以轻松跳过多数NFT项目从默默无闻到建立文化的过程，因为优秀IP本身早已积累了号召力和认同感。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HG8Vevd1sTd4dd6IZtUOx.png?height=312&width=1080)\n\n潜力和风险\n\n潜力：\n\n* IP和伙伴加持利于项目启动\n\nCRIPCO自带Line Friends IP, 无论对于吸引圈外用户还是NFT老手玩家来说都具备足够的吸引力；此外与其合作的知名潮流公司成员，如陈冠希和藤原浩等，在潮流领域也具备强大号召力，以他们的IP为卖点在平台上线初期发布独家NFT，也有利于积攒人气。这种资源优势在文化领域至关重要，大众追逐成熟IP，无需从头开始建立信任。\n\n* 更低的交易手续费和工具集成\n\n从规划看，CRIPCO的手续费在1%，而其他平台在2-2.5%左右。1个点的差距对于高价NFT来说，实际节省的费用绝对值也很可观。此外如果CRIPCO能够按规划提供NFT分析工具，则相对于其他NFT平台来说是明显的体验优势。\n\n* 鼓励NFT持有者二创\n\n除了被动持有NFT等待价值变化，CRIPCO提供创作工具方便用户对NFT进行二创，衍生出更多IP文化的同时也能让自己的二创获得收益。这个设计明显区于目前NFT市场的玩法，长期来看对于提升平台自己的美誉度和盘活粉丝经济来说都有益处。\n\n风险：\n\n* DAO成员决策NFT上架效果待观察\n\n采用DAO模式决定NFT的上下架，实际执行过程中可能会面临问题：例如如何保证成员的决策是亲力亲为，如何杜绝成员之间串通合谋同意某些低质量NFT上架等。DAO并不是一个集中的强利益绑定共同体，成员的决策动机和持久度，都需要产品上线后被检验。\n\n* NFT市场用户习惯扭转存在难度\n\n绝大多数的用户目前仍然习惯选择Opensea等平台进行NFT交易。平台型产品一旦建立先发优势，短时间内较难撼动。而CRIPCO选择使用自家的IP3通证作为NFT交易的媒介，这也是一种反习惯的门槛。结合各平台自己的用户获客手段，用户是否会为了更优质的IP转投CRIPCO平台，仍是一个未知数。\n\nCRIPCO这类平台的出现让NFT市场有了更多的玩法。\n\n无论是利用DAO来决策NFT的上架，还是让持有NFT的用户进行二次创作，这些都在激发原生社区的参与感和创造力。\n\n对于NFT来说，当我们不再单纯的将其视作为一种资产，而是围绕NFT背后的IP打造更多的参与空间时，IP经济和粉丝经济更大的能量才会得以激发。并最终为做大整个行业蛋糕，扩展更多的用户做出积极贡献。\n\n本内容不构成投资建议",

NFTGo.io의 고래 추적 기능을 사용하면 많은 양의 NFT를 보유한 계정을 추적하고 디스코드(Discord)에서 고래 경고를 추적할 수 있다.\n\n### 양날의 검\n\n고래는 주로 구매와 판매라는 두 가지 측면에서 시장을 뒤흔든다.\n\n구매: 일부 고래는 좋은 프로젝트의 가치에 대한 강한 믿음을 가지고 있으며 어려운 시기에 이러한 프로젝트를 보호하기 위해 최저가 구매를 한다. 또한 가격 급등은 일반적으로 고래의 대규모 구매와 관련이 있다. 그러나 일부 고래는 대량으로 바닥을 쓸어 수집 가격을 인상한다는 것도 유의해야 한다(일부 거래에는 가장매매가 포함될 수 있음). 그런 다음 FOMO가 시작되어 시장 심리가 높을 때 사람들이 진입하도록 자극한다. 이 시점에서 고래는 상당한 이익을 위해 NFT의 일부를 판매할 가능성이 높다.\n\n매도: 고래가 NFT를 시세보다 낮게 매도해 연이어 매도하여 바닥가 변동을 일으키는 경우가 있다. 그러면 사람들은 패닉에 빠져 자신의 자산을 그보다 낮은 가격에 팔기 시작한다. 이때 고래는해당 NFT가 나중에 오를 것을 알면 저가 매수를 할 것이다. 또한 고래는 내부 소식을 바탕으로 미리 계획을 세움으로 항상 고랠를 주시하는 것이 좋다.\n\n## NFT 보유자 분배\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZgPrlP2Wnmvibx33nXhm_.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\n고래는 바다에서 작은 물고기를 먹는다.

NFT 판매 시기는 비즈니스 모델과 게임의 신규 사용자에 따라 다르다. 펭귄과 마찬가지로 이 사람들은 위의 모든 보유자로부터 멀리 떨어져 있다. 따라서 PFP 바다의 변동은 컬렉션에 영향을 미치지 않는다.\n\n행동: 펭귄들은 GameFi 스테이킹이 요구하기 때문에 NFT를 구매한다. 이러한 NFT가 스테이킹되어 개발자의 스테이킹 주소로 전송되면 빈 OS 페이지가 남게 된다. 그러나 빈 페이지가 수익을 최대화하는 가장 좋은 방법일 수 있으므로 이것이 고유한 수익 창출 사고 방식을 방해하지는 않는다.\n\n영향: 낮음\n\n자산: 중하\n\nNFT 신념: 낮음\n\n수익성: 중하\n\n보유 기간: 중\n\n## 보유자, 커뮤니티 톤\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TZFc7T3Lq3vpT2GNDOC5_.jpg?height=900&width=1600)\n\n많은 사람들이 하나의 거래 스타일을 고수하지는 않는다. 거래 참조를 선택할 때 재정, 위험 선호도 및 장기 목표를 고려하는 것이 중요하다.\n\n@mentalist420은 다음과 같이 말했다.\n\n\"투자자가 있고 수집가가 있다.\"\n\n프로젝트에서 투자자 유형의 비율이 다르면 향후 개발에 영향을 미친다. 프로젝트 참여자의 80% 이상이 투기꾼이라면 과대 광고가 진정된 후 프로젝트가 0이 될 가능성이 매우 높다. 그러나 HODLers가 프로젝트의 대부분을 구성한다면 프로젝트는 아마도 잘 될 거다. 이 맥락은 NFT 제작자에게 힌트가 될 수도 있겠다.\n\n누구를 위해 컬렉션을 만들고 있는 걸까?

深度解析—从当前市场，看未来 SocialFi 的发展\n\nWeb 3.0 和 Web 2.0 最大的区别就是 Web 3.0 改变了数据这种生产资料的所有权（和因此衍生的其他权利）的归属和流动等，它以“去中心化”的方式，让生产资料回归到真实的生产者，进而改变了社会的生产关系。\n\n去中心化社交和金融的结合，可打破平台垄断、消除单点风险，在全球数字经济系统的浪潮中创造全新业务模式和产品类别。\n\n利用 Web 3.0 的去中心化计算、去中心化存储和去中心化隐私保护的技术可实现：\n\n* 平台打通，用户数据无需迁移 （孤岛--开放）；\n* 链上存储，用户能获取的信息更丰富（封闭--共享）；\n* 加密算法，提高隐私安全 （泄露/丢失/篡改--安全）。\n\n传统 Web 2.0 更加突出平台的影响力，而 Web 3.0 会更加突出个人的社交影响力，促进开发个人兴趣，解放了每个参与者的生产积极性。\n\n总体来看，当前的大多数 SocialFi 产品暂时只能满足 Crypto Native 用户纯链上的社交+金融需求，未来肯定会出现能够广泛普及且能同时满足链上和映射链下真实世界社交+金融需求的 SocialFi 产品。\n\n[查看更多](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/WPzQpP7tfeuereqiACupkg)\n\n## 解析链上数据分析平台发展现状与趋势\n\n虽然区块链记录着所有原始的交易数据，链上数据本身都是公开透明的，但直接查询区块链来求得问题答案是非常耗时耗力的，为了让链上数据能够被快速检索，当前主流的链上数据分析平台会将索引得到的原始链上数据，经过一系列处理后，存入由平台负责更新和管理的数据仓库中。\n\n* Nansen 是大家最为熟悉的链上数据分析平台之一。相较于其他平台，其最为出色的功能是钱包标记（wallet profiler/wallet labeling），同时也可以给用户提供标准化的信息报告界面。\n* Token Terminal 以提供准确的协议收入（protocol revenue）而著名。基于协议收入，Token Terminal 计算了各协议的市销率（P/S），市盈率（P/E）等数据。这些数据在一定程度上为各协议提供了估值基准。\n* Dune Analytics 是最早开放用户自主查询的链上数据分析平台，拥有最大的分析师团体和用户社区。Dune Analytics 提供了高度颗粒化的原始链上数据，分析师可以自由地利用这些数据写出自定义的查询。但自主查询具备一定的门槛，分析师需具备 PostgreSQL 的编写能力才能创造满足自己需求的数据查询。\n* Footprint Analytics 不仅提供原始区块链数据，更将链上数据进行分级。最原始的链上数据为铜级别 （Bronze data），经过筛选、清洗和增强的数据为银级别（Silver data），进一步整理出具备业务意义的数据为金级别（Gold data）。\n\n[查看更多](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/o1pO7unj3cUS9sWt4q_gBw)\n\n## 牛市新公链主题回顾\n\n2021 年的加密货币很大程度上是由 jpeg NFT 狂热和 L1 链轮动定义的。从 2020 年 DeFi Summer 开始，持续至 2021 年初，以太坊网络拥塞和高昂的 gas 成本问题变得越来越明显。\n\n2021 年，随着分片和 Plasma 从以太坊 2.0 路线图中消失，为了满足扩展性需求，同时保持去中心化，以太坊将全部精力放在了 Rollup 上。但在 2021 年，Rollups 根本没有准备好。即使到现在——2022 年年中，Rollups 仍然没有准备好满足来自全球用户的需求。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/J1dde6s.png)\n\n然而随着需求增加，新公链也出现性能瓶颈，也会发生拥堵。于是通过增加区块容量提高吞吐量，这又增加了运行完整节点的硬件要求，显然这是不可持续的。这些新链本质就是以太坊侧链，但不具有以太坊的安全性或去中心化水平。随着一个链变得拥挤，只需启动另一个侧链，开启新的旋转飞轮。\n\n[查看更多](https://chainlinkgod.medium.com/the-layer-1-chain-rotation-thesis-a-retrospective-analysis-3cbd2dcdc1f8)\n\n# Web3 模式\n\n### Web2 用户增长经验如何应用到 Web3？\n\nWeb3 如何做增长是最近谈到很多的话题，不管是链游，基础设施，还是 DeFi 都一样。大家都在探索更好的用户增长方式。近期钱包应用 Bitkeep 利用传统模式带来了有趣的体验。\n\n将 AARRR 模型用在用户运营上。传统 AARRR 由获客开始，激发活跃、提高留存、增加收入、高效传播形成循环。以上在 Bitkeep 中也运用的非常接地气，比如以补贴形式获取客流。用户能通过限时秒杀的形式以比地板价还低的价格购买到 NFT，甚至设计了传统电商中的流量款与爆款逻辑来带动整体销售与流量增长。\n\n又比如在促活方面，通过调整发售时间来激活用户优化。在高效传播中使用了加密微信红包。是的，你没看错，Bitkeep 能让用户直接分享到微信群，而且整个体验流程跟微信做了很好的适配，非常的丝滑。\n诸如此类手段在 Web2.0 中稀松平常，可以说是老运营人的家常便饭，但是运用在 Web3 中，由地址、NFT 又生出很多新的玩法。其实当 Web2 从业者进入 Web3，带动一些成熟的市场玩法使其在 Web3 得到应用，效果也是非常好的。\n\n### 为什么 Web3 会成为游戏的新商业模式？\n\n用一个简单例子来解释这个问题：因为开放经济的企业生态比封闭经济的更好、更耐用，后者的价值主要由单一方创造和拥有，比如自由市场国家（美国）与计划经济的国家（苏联、古巴）。\n现在大多数大型游戏都是封闭型经济，用户不能自由地在游戏中进行数字货币或数字资产的交易。但如果一个游戏创建一个开放的经济平台，通过一个开放的API使他们的所有资产可以交易和转让，这样的游戏可以更加庞大、更加持久。\n实现这一切一定需要区块链吗？其实不一定，但区块链和 NFT 是实现这一目标的途径之一，把数字货币和资产放在链上只是创建开放经济的一种方式，这样可以让系统具备开放、无需信任的优点，而且现在势头最为强劲。\n\n[查看原文](https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1546592578912456704)\n[查看中文编译](https://techflowpost.mirror.xyz/LLGYAWbR6p22lG_Awb5KIcw7xpBJH4JOQwDXNmVNoXU)\n\n### 公会如何帮助 Web3 游戏价值增值？\n\n一个成功的游戏里，一定存在一大批游戏的游戏公会。那这些公会能从哪些方面来推动游戏变得更好呢？\n\n* 首先，公会会给新的游戏引流用户，甚至可以将原来的 Web2 的游戏玩家带领入 Web3 的世界。并帮忙建立游戏的初始社区。\n* 其次，游戏公能将好的游戏点或者游戏 Bug 反馈到项目团队，同时帮助游戏进行完整的 Beta 测试。\n* 此外，通过游戏公会的运作，能提升游戏玩家对于游戏的黏性。并形成性的粉丝圈，甚至发展到游戏的相关周边衍生。\n\n[查看更多](https://twitter.com/chng_raymond/status/1547056068676636672)\n\n### Messari 报告：房地产与加密货币\n\n当前高额的房地产市场让大多数的美国人都没有能力买房，但以加密货币为中心的房地产初创公司通过区块链技术为房地产投资者提供了独特的机会。\n\n1. 通过以下方式创造一个更有效的房地产市场：Token 化房地产资产；加密抵押贷款；从所有权分割中创建更广泛的资金池。\n2. 通过链接点对点的以太坊智能合约，简化了全球范围的房地产购买流程。\n3. @PropyInc 协议由三个核心部分组成：上市平台+交易平台+区块链注册 卖家在提供所有随附的法律文件后，将其财产列为NFT在市场上，买家可以立即开始报价。\n4. @vestaequityvpm 为业主提供一种独特的方法，可以兑现其上升的房屋净值。\n\n[查看更多](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1546151198729703429)\n\n### 现实公司的代币化将推动 Web3 的下一次大爆发\n\n代币化是 Web3 的重大突破。它为创新创造了巨大的可能性，但也打开了潘多拉魔盒。实用代币是指在产品生命周期中有明确用途的代币，而不是让持有者分享公司利润的“股权代币”，后者类似于股票，并且在未来可能会遇到监管方面的障碍。\n\n传统企业如何从实用代币中受益？ 这里有 3 种方法：\n\n1. 用户黏性/用户忠诚度：最简单的实用代币使用案例是作为一个奖励计划——用户越是使用产品，就能获得更多的代币，然后代币可以在未来兑换更多的产品。允许一个人赚取的“积分”在公共区块链上的二级市场具有流动性，这很大程度上颠覆了传统的商业激励模式。\n2. 为增长的营销支出提供资金，而不影响当前的现金流：2000 年，PayPal 向新用户奖励了数千万美元的注册奖金，以引导其使用。 这是一个很好的激励措施，但却是从公司金库中取出的真实现金。但如果注册奖励是代币形式，则不会影响公司当前的现金状况。\n3. 扩大利益相关者基础：一个好的货币应该以相对稳定的价格为目的来使用户对代币产生长期信任。 所以应该激励用户赚取更多的代币，而不是让他们坐等代币升值。你的代币在二级市场上流通的事实意味着，它能互动的人比你的实际用户数量更多。\n\n哪些类型的公司适合拥有这种代币？几个基本标准：\n\n* 产品与市场的契合度：确保产品具有足够的粘性，维护你所吸引的用户。\n* 边际成本：代币奖励的发放是以您未来的收入为代价的。 如果你的边际成本随着用户数量的增加而下降，那就没什么问题。\n* 赢家通吃的市场：重点是这个市场应该有足够的空间来有意义地推动需求曲线上升。\n* 商业模式允许代币具有明确的效用：例子：你的产品售价为 X 美元/月，用户可以用代币支付，最高可达 Y%。\n\n[查看更多](https://techflowpost.mirror.xyz/MIc3oAlIDzx_q87vGAgBsiR78nU33-f_sdDXkgY85vo)\n\n## 技术解读\n\n### ERC-4907，将给 NFT 金融带来什么改变？\n\n可出租 NFT 和 ERC-4907 是一个相当棒的代币标准，对 DeFi 有很大影响，因为它为独特的贷款和结构性产品奠定了基础。\n\nERC-4907 将所有者定义，通过 NFT 这种最佳方式向债券持有人分配现金流，有了这个代币标准，资产的 \"所有者 \"可以将现金流的权利卖给另一个 \"用户 \"而不放弃所有权，用户在贷款到期之前收到现金流。\n\n[查看更多](https://t.co/rpn3fzAqm6)\n\n### 研究 NFT 智能合约的方法\n\n如果要制作 NFT 项目，你就必须先创建 NFT 智能合约。当下最流行的构建标准是 ERC721 标准，它有利于创建独特的数字资产。\n\nERC721 的主要实现方式包括：ERC721 OZ；ERC721A；ERC721 solmate。这些实现方式在不同程度上为用户在 NFT 项目的各项基本活动中，都节省了 gas。\n\n还有一些实验性质的实现方式也值得我们去注意：\n\n* ERC721S—— “超级 gas 友好型”NFT 设计\n* ERC721:Shadow — 专门用于大型铸币厂活动\n\n文章还介绍了 RTFKT 的首席技术官 Samuel Cardillo 对历史上一些项目的评价。\n\n[查看更多](https://0xbanklesscn.substack.com/p/-nft--932?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)\n\n## 市场分析\n\n### Crypto VC 上半年报告\n\n<https://www.odaily.news/post/5180237>\n\n2022 年上半年的 VC 投资金额达 300 亿美金。与其 2021 年上半年的接近 100 亿相比，升幅高达 200%。值得一提的是 a16z 在上半年筹集了 45 亿美金，比第二名和第三名的红衫 (20亿）和 FTX (20亿）加起来要多。加币市场处于熊市的初期，相信 2022 年的下半年和上半年相比不会有太大的升幅甚至倒退。\n\n### 宏观指标对于加密市场情绪的影响\n\n2020 年以前，由于加密市场与股票等传统金融市场的相关性较低，许多投资者把比特币看作一种能够对抗通胀的数字黄金（和主流金融资产对冲的避险资产）。近期的数据表明，加密市场市值与标普500系数同步变动，其相关系数现已升至历史最高水平 0.9。文章解释了为什么出现这种情况。\n\n理解宏观对于加密市场投资的必要性。加密资产的投资逻辑与科技股类似，由两部分构成：实际营收，投资者的增长预期。当投资者风险偏好降低，以及资产本身的收益/风险比值恶化时，投资者就会抛弃这种高风险资产。而这两者都与宏观环境有关。\n\n对市场当下情绪的理解及预判：\n\n* 市场对于短期加息状态已有消极预期，对于九月以至明年的加息状态处于模糊状态，市场关注点逐渐向 GDP 转移。\n* 7 月底至 9 月处于信息真空期，市场无法明确明年的通胀情况及衰退预期，短期内存在反弹空间。\n\n## 政策分析\n\n### 国际证券监管机构 IOSCO 将关注全球 DeFi、加密规则\n\n国际证券委员会组织 (IOSCO) 是一个由来自世界各地的证券监管机构组成的协会，正在为加密货币制定政策建议。该文件称，IOSCO 的金融科技工作组于 3 月成立，将在未来 12 个月至 24 个月内优先考虑与加密资产相关的以政策为重点的工作。\n\n两个工作组（一个由美国证券交易委员会牵头，另一个由英国金融行为监管局牵头）已同意在 2023 年底之前分别发布包含去中心化金融。两个工作组都将关注与市场诚信和投资者保护有关的问题，并就如何将现有的证券监管框架应用于数字资产提供指导。\n\n[查看更多](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/11/international-securities-regulator-iosco-to-focus-on-global-defi-crypto-rules/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=rss&utm_campaign=headlines)\n\n##

资源。\n\n### 以太坊基金会研究团队对于扩容的 AMA\n\n扩容问题一直都是以太坊要面对的最大问题之一，通过这次的 AMA 可以对以太坊将来的发展有好的了解。其中一题问题是关于以太坊作为全球支付系统的可能性，以太坊基金会 Justin Drake 说将来以太坊会透过 Rollups，分片和带宽速度的提升达至 1000 万 TPS。\n\n[查看更多](https://ecn.mirror.xyz/9i0WOEejkz-DeP3RLFPEANi11HclHzcgTrFgUwMGF4U)\n\n\n---\n\n### · 关于 SnapFingers DAO ·\n\nEmpowered by Assembly Partners\n\nSnapFingers DAO

EMA(26)**\n\n大部分软件默认都是12日和26日均线，因为以前每周股票交易日是6天，2周就是12天，一个月就是26天。\n\n看，**本质上就是均线！**\n\nDIF是短期移动平均线和长期移动平均线之差，其上下运动就反映了两均线的聚合背离情况，这也是MACD原本的含义，于是就叫作聚合背离移动平均线，Appel是想通过DIF线的运动反映出股票当前所处趋势，这是一个趋势指标。\n\n至于后面又整出来的什么顶背离、底背离，有兴趣的自己去推敲一下，也没那么神奇。\n\n另一条曲线就是DEA：\n\n**DEA：DIF值的移动平均线**\n\n看到没，\\*\\*还是均线！\\*\\*现在的软件基本都默认为DIF取9日平均线。\n\nDEA伴随着DIF运动而运动，反应更慢更平滑一些。DIF线从DEA线下方向上突破DEA线，并且DEA线也向上运行，就是**金叉**；DIF线从DEA线上方向下突破DEA线，并且DEA线也向下运行，就是**死叉**。金叉和死叉反映了价格运动的趋势信号，常可以作为买卖的依据，金叉是买入信号的进一步确认；死叉是卖出信号的进一步确认。DEA线就是为得到这个信号而设立的，所以又叫信号线，也是一个趋势指标。\n\n但金叉就买入，死叉是卖出？\n\n如果能这样，那市场未免太过简单！\n\n依然是相信常识，了解他的原理。\n\nDIF是一条更快的趋势反应曲线，只要价格不是永远上涨、不是永远下跌，那它和DEA就必然会相交，而这个交叉是由已经形成的价格决定的，而不是反过来！如果价格趋势能延续则买卖信号会很准，但如果价格趋势翻转则买卖信号就可能跑飞机！所以这些信号自然也不能预测价格、预测行情！\n\n![BTC K线、均线及MACD](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0AhMRtvyglD16Yc8TOYt6.png?height=309&width=720)\n\nMACD的最后一个拼图就是红绿柱：\n\n1986年美国人Thomas Aspray在Appel的基础上加入柱状线，就成了现今常用的MACD。\n\n**红绿柱：(DIF-DEA) \\* 2**\n\n这是一个更直观地看DIF和DEA差值的指标，其本质上是表达上涨或下跌的力度，柱子越高差值越大，其上涨或下跌的力度也就越大。\n\n而细心的交易者也会发现当绿柱变为红柱时（股市相反），必然会出现DIF与DEA的死叉；当红柱变为绿柱时，又必然对应DIF与DEA的金叉。\n\n再推敲一下就能发现，这个和DIF表达的信息是一样的。\n\n说了那么多，我们应该可以看出，MACD也仅仅是一个趋势指标，是对当前价格走势的表达，同样也不能预测行情！\n\nMACD只是一个指标工具，显然没有某些老师分析(BB)的那么神奇，但作为一个极其自律的投资者来讲，Appel对交易者建议还是十分有意义的：\n\n1. 自律观念：要始终遵守自己的交易系统\n2. 限制损失：以事先计划止损\n3. 交易体系：计划你的交易，交易你的计划\n4. 控制情绪：任何时候都要事先计划以避免错误\n\n是的，对于任何交易者来说，都应该建立一个适合自己的交易系统，形成良好的交易习惯。\n\n### 结尾：\n\n指标我们就分享到这里，还有很多其他指标可以自行去了解，但重要的是抓住它的本质，肢解它的实现，而不是浮于表面。\n\nK线就是个价格表达工具！\n\n均线基于K线，也是价格表达工具！\n\nMACD基于均线，就更是价格表达工具！\n\n通过红绿柱获得的信息，看DIF就可以；\n\n通过DIF获得的信息，看均线就可以；\n\n通过均线获得的信息，看裸K就可以；\n\n所以，我通常一般都直接看K线。\n\n我的文章不会做技术分析，也不推荐买啥币，我也没能力带带你！认真去理解这些工具，找到自己的投资逻辑！\n\n有些价值 (死拿)投资者常常会BB，看这些指标根本没用，跟扔筛子一样，价格涨跌根本无法预测。\n\n说对了一半，价格是无法预测，但看指标绝对不是扔筛子，我们下一篇会讲。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_tkaq6HbfNQGRb4v-cGDN.png?height=68&width=720)\n\n转载请注明出处，写作不易，如果对你有帮助请随意打赏：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4uYJYnSqpwC0_P_JrKaf5.png?height=235&width=720)\n\nBTC地址：bc1qkj5ms07nw68tg20pyft6xl2ghe2qylw466ug8u\n\nETH/USDT/USDC地址：0xaf5624ebc8023f457b67eb3f50c560a606bf5582\n\nDOGE地址：DHboLCa8diAn1DoJ4KCM5958q9KRg9EBha", "timestamp": 1658401193, "digest": "aR8w1GDnNUF9e02cF7ULtdarTnMPfPpJ4LTMQWsFht0", "contributor": "0xaF5624Ebc8023f457b67Eb3f50c560a606bf5582"}

大阪、堂岛米市、锚形图、K线\n\n1614-1615年，德川家族打败了以大阪为据点的丰臣家族，宣告战国时代结束。德川家族在江户设立幕府，由此开启了260年的江户时代。（江户即现在的东京）\n\n德川幕府在各地设藩，大名就安排自己人，从而方便治理，为了防止丰臣家族旧势力再次发动叛乱，特意不在大阪设藩，大阪直接成为幕府直辖地，各地原有封建领主也多被迁往江户。藩地的大名每年需要给幕府进贡大米，租种封建领主土地的农民也需要交纳稻米，但在当时从各地运送稻米到江户困难重重，所以在交通便利的港口城市大阪建立了米仓，将大米存入米仓即可换取相应的“大米库券”，也可以方便随时交易，至此用于储存各地大名进贡的贡米粮仓林立。\n\n大阪最早的米市在大商人淀屋家的前院，淀屋为全日本的大米交易所设立标准，并建立了统一的交易市场，使大阪成为了真正的商业之都，全国各地的米商蜂拥而至。到了第五代淀屋辰五郎，就已经是江户中期大阪的巨富了，积蓄价值超过白银一亿两 (按今天折算约有十几万亿日元)，辰五郎穷奢极欲、桀骜不逊，引得怨声载道。1705年，德川幕府以其拥有的财富与身份不符为由，将淀屋的资产全部没收。(是不是似曾相识，流氓都一个样！)\n\n随着淀屋家的灭亡，米市也搬到了对岸的堂岛，成就了后来大名鼎鼎的堂岛米市，1710年前还只是进行大米的实物交易，之后就出现了“建物米”标准化合同，结算主要通过账面上的资金而非实际交付大米，参与者提供“敷銀”作为保证金即可进行交易，堂岛米市也就成为了世界上最早的期货市场，当时的堂岛直接左右着整个日本大米市场，大阪也因此成了“国家的厨房”、“天下粮仓”。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K6goWkTcSRwAail9T8c6m.jpg?height=448&width=720)\n\n米市在春、夏、冬3季开市，每天上午8点到下午2点进行交易（中午闭市休息），下午2点结束之前会有一条大约一英寸长的火绳挂在太仓的屋檐下点燃，完全烧完即当日闭市，这时的价格被称为“火绳价”，同时也成为下一交易日的开盘价。\n\n江户时期的日本没有统一货币，金、银、铜并行，它们的之间的价格由市场决定，当时日本的大名和武士俸禄都用大米而不是货币，所以大米经纪人和货币兑换商成为最重要的两股力量，大米成为了重要的计价单位，通过使用大米来计算金、银、铜的价值，再来决定三者之间的兑换汇率，堂岛米市不仅是一个期货市场，也成为一个货币兑换市场。\n\n江户末期，堂岛大米会所逐渐开始用开盘价、最高价、最低价、收盘价这四个价格进行记录，不知道是不是因为大阪是港口城市，大米以船舶为主要运输工具，逐渐出现了锚形图（anchor chart）的米线四价，竖线两头分别代表最高价及最低价，水平的线段表示开盘价，箭头代表收盘价。箭头朝下代表收盘价低于开盘价，箭头朝上代表收盘价高于开盘价，这样一天的交易概况跃然纸上，对今后行情变化提供了关键依据。\n\n![锚形图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NivMroHKXCxfk0dR5JheT.png?height=169&width=720)\n\n锚形图在较长的时间内很好地描述了大米格涨跌情况，但其过于复杂的缺点也足够明显，最终又慢慢演变成为K线图（蜡烛图），大阪繁荣的商业和货币兑换业务，为K线的生长提供了土壤，K线起源于日本米市也绝非偶然，这是众多日本商人的智慧结晶。\n\n![K线图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y_JA86po61u7cVAVzMy9G.png?height=153&width=720)\n\n### 本间宗久、酒田战法、风林火山\n\n但历史往往需要找个人来包装才方便传唱，就像我们这边耳熟能详的诸葛孔明，K线的孔明就是本间宗久，他大概生于1724年，幼名加藤吉作，长大后被本间家族收养。\n\n本间家族所在的酒田港出羽地区是十七世纪米市的重要产地及商业交易中心，在家族的耳濡目染下，本间宗久全力研究稻米现货买卖及期货交易价格走势，在其《三猿金泉录》里归纳了其长期稻米交易心得，颇具前瞻性的就是虽然稻米的价格与供需有很大的关系，但价格也同时受交易者的心理影响，价格与商品的实际价值存在差距，不知道这是不是描述市场情绪最早的文献。\n\n本间宗久胆识过人精心研究行情战术，预估行情无不神准，不但赚进巨额财富也在京都、大阪、江户（现在的东京）地区引起很大的轰动，人们形容他为出羽の天狗，尊为相場の神様，甚至还流传着这样的传说：你可以挣上领主的宝座，却休想象本间宗久家一样有钱，其富有和影响力可见一斑。这种情况下顺势来个造神运动，K线首创者标签也就贴上了，讽刺的是在其原版《本间宗久の秘录》中却找不到任何图形，后来有学者证实他处的那个时代日本连锚形图都还没有出现，又何来的K线，后人为他总结的第一本图形版本也是在昭和二十四年才出现。\n\n在日本最初K线写做 “罫线”，罫字上四下卦，自然就有了四象生八卦的阴阳说...传说本间宗久 效仿《周易》中“阴”、“阳”爻象，创制了以阴阳二线为基准的“罫线”，用以“占卜”未来的市场走向，其中阳线表示收盘价大于开盘价，阴线表示收盘价低于开盘价...\n\n因为本间宗久记录心得引用了很多战法中的名词，又出生于酒田，所以后人就将其总结为《酒田战法》，配合着的又冒出来个《风林火山》。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Oc24aUNzHZF_vxDvIxtA1.png?height=269&width=720)\n\n《酒田战法》共有78招式，包括现在耳熟能详的大阳线、大阴线、十字星、覆盖线 (吞没)、红三兵、U形反转...其中最重要的就是酒田五法：三山、三川、三空、三兵、三法\n\n三山：即三尊头、两尊头、圆头三种型态，三尊就是我们熟悉的头肩顶，因日本那个时候也笃信佛教，中间一尊即代表如来佛，左右则分别为普贤和文殊菩萨。两尊头就是俗称的“M”型。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vx08_jVccsa8B6kZpYQZN.png?height=227&width=720)\n\n三川：即三山的相反型态，因形同三条河流故而得名，就是我们所说的头肩底，W及V型底。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nl9x343x5uJI2HUU_3RE3.png?height=216&width=720)\n\n三兵：即我们经常听到的红三兵、黑三兵（三只乌鸦），红三兵为买入信号、黑三兵为卖出信号。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U9omcLBZGFbTyvUGInA6H.png?height=202&width=720)\n\n三空：也就是连续三个上跳空或下跳空，上跳三空为强势涨升信号，下跳三空则为下跌信号。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OTlmpd1NsgXlTo7-zAwBF.png?height=231&width=720)\n\n三法：即酒田三法里的应该买、应该卖、应该休息，若一串连续的K线组合同时隐含买进、卖出与观忘的暗示时，原则建议先观望等待。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A2fqj9etpvVMp91HLN-0Y.png?height=287&width=720)\n\n《孙子兵法 · 军争篇》有：“其疾如风，其徐如林，侵掠如火，不动如山”，这也是酒田战法奉为真理的四大指导原则：\n\n其疾如风：行情反转或破位，不对头时赶快处置目前的仓位\n\n其徐如林：盘整时步调放缓，低进高出\n\n侵掠如火：单边的连续走势，一路追杀决不犹豫手软，并抱牢赚钱的部位，只追加不平仓\n\n不动如山：形势不明，勉强入场不但难以图利，还必须承受极大的风险，不如退场观望\n\n怎么说呢？是不是用屁股想都觉得很扯！这个我们后面说，再来看一位神屌\\~\n\n### 史蒂夫·尼森、日本工业革命、K线分析之父\n\n1868年新势力推翻德川幕府的统治，日本进入明治时代，机器大工业正式代替了工场手工业，资本主义制度确立。而后的10年日本工业制造飞速发展，全面吊打美国，更好的汽车、更好的收音机、更好的电视、更好的玩具、更好的一切... 日本国民也在美国开始了大规模的购买狂潮，洛克菲勒中心、酒店、大片商业地产，甚至所有他们看得见的东西...日本人一度被认为是老美的“上级”，到了90年代后期美国政客迫不得已开始限制过日本国民购置地产。\n\n所有这一切都促成了一种文化现象，即任何日本的东西都被认为比美国好。美国社会开始对日本事物着迷，老美渴望了解有关日本人的一切，在大学里强调日语的国际商务学位，空手道、日语学习、寿司餐厅、忍者餐厅，是的…也包括后来金融市场的蜡烛图。\n\n如此的文化浪潮，这次抓住机会的是美国人史蒂夫·尼森。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0rZ_H1yOyMxF-hUb8p6Bh.png?height=257&width=720)\n\n这已经是N多年后的1990年了，尼森第一次向西方引进了日本罫线，次年他的《阴线阳线：日本蜡烛图技术——远东古代投资技术的当代指南》一出版就引起了不小的轰动，故事情节是古代日本大米贸易商使用这种罫线图表来记录当前价格，然后通过对罫线的组合分析预测未来的价格走势。书中传说一个超级秘密而古老的日本部落，生活在富士山的高处，每年这些神秘部落居民会下山，他们随身携带古老的宣纸卷轴，上面有他们自己才能解读的标记，他们对秘密符号的解释使他们能够控制大米的价格...不管怎样，日本人民在米市几百年的智慧及投资秘诀跃然纸上，蜡烛图、三线反转图、砖块图、折线图的魅力折服了西方，史蒂夫·尼森也因此被西方金融界誉为“K线分析之父”。而后很快各种老师、金融大师、顾问、软件供应商都用自己版本充斥市场想要分一杯羹，而尼森能做的就是宣称他是第一个及最好的。\n\n罫在日本读为kei，引入之后慢慢地就以KEI的英文第一个字母“K”直译为K线，由于引入太晚，所以你在读一些美国华尔街的经典投资类书籍时是找不到K线的。\n\n### 欧洲、点状图、杆状图、棒形图\n\n证券市场起源于欧洲，在日本罫线传入欧美之前，就已经形成一整套自己的分析技术。西方很早就开始用图表进行商业分析，包括柱状图（column chart）、条形图（bar chart）等，其雏形可以追溯到1350年。西方在证券投资分析方面主要是点状图、杆状图、条形图、棒形图等，直到今天仍然被投资者使用：\n\n点状图(point chart) ：又称为停顿图(stoping chart)、线形图(line chart)或星状图(star chart)，是最早的市场形态图形，只记录收盘价，每个收盘价用直线或折线连接，因此也称为收盘价线。可以对标为我们现在的趋势图。\n\n![点状图—收盘价](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8R4SASwWRgBf-I7XzLbPQ.png?height=93&width=720)\n\n杆状图(prole char) ：因形状类似旗杆而得名，记录各交易时段的最高价与最低价，以及两者之间的距离（显示每个交易时段的波幅）。\n\n条形图 (bar chart)：也称为棒形图，由点状图与杆状图结合而成。杆状右侧有一小横线，表示收盘价，但没有开盘价。\n\n竹节图(bar chart)：在条形图基础上增加了开盘价，可以显示交易时段中的最高价、最低价、收盘价和开盘价。这种图是最接近现代K线图的，在美国最常见。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rxhnaye-ZqVkqdaAx_lKH.png?height=170&width=720)\n\n根据不同的角度还有一些其他的标识价格的方法，有兴趣可以自行查阅\\~\n\n### K线、预测、带单老师\n\n币圈最近几年中心化交易所遍地开花，百倍币、永续合约给了大家快速走向人生巅峰的幻觉，各种一夜暴富的消息将本来就fomo (Fear of missing out) 的年轻人情绪一次次拉起，于是他们总想走点捷径、学点技术、听听分析，嘴里总是挂着一句：dddd，于是自然就催生一门生意：跟单交易。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Mv1tEq_3NuR6rC8t7lADf.png?height=165&width=720)\n\n这个年代KOL收割粉丝也不容易，有交易就跑不了K线分析，要带大家致富（负）首先就得预测行情，你就听着各种带单老师一本正经地胡说八道，各种基于K线及型态的技 (Pian)术分析...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NkgUx9Aw1g3qKwal6kUmU.png?height=177&width=720)\n\nK线倒是可以分析，但行情能预测的么？\n\n显然不行！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KK6hb6uh9pSkz1623toEn.png?height=243&width=720)\n\n稍微有点常识就知道他为什么不行！\n\nK线能告诉我们Open价、Close价、High价、Low价以及涨幅信息，它是目前世界上最直观、最方便的价格记录及呈现方式。\n\n而价格是由交易形成的，这个市场上有人买也有人卖，买卖成交的那一刻就形成了价格，在既定时间内一笔一笔交易价格就画出了单根K线（也可以叫蜡烛元素），连续的N多根K线就构成了K线图。这里面是多空博弈的结果，做多的力量大于做空价格就会上涨，做空的力量大于做多价格自然就下跌，是先有了交易才有价格，而不是反过来！是先有了价格才形成K线，而不是反过来！\n\nK线是基于统计的，基于统计的历史数据怎么能有预测能力？\n\n那又为什么总有人预测，总有人信？\n\n那是因为技 (Pian)术分析里隐藏的一个重要的哲学道理：历史会重演！\n\n上一轮牛市18年比特币出现双头顶，所以21年底也会出现双头顶... 以前发生过的事情，这次也会发生...\n\n那历史会重演吗？当然会\n\n但，你不知道它将发生在哪里！\n\n只要你的预测是出现条件A的情况下就会发生B，那就肯定是偶尔准但大多数跑飞机。带单老师之所以能生存就是他善于将所有情况都分析（BB）到，然后把其中预测准的放大，通过话术技巧规避那些跑飞机的...准不准不重要，他也不靠交易赚钱，你的佣金、客损才是他的盈利模式...\n\n而对于你无非就是：拉了跟着喊2声区块链革命，跌了就是CX骗局！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uLMwiH1cWwHI31cjq6egU.png?height=112&width=720)\n\n这个世界总是存在2个极端的人…\n\n有些价值投资者、巴菲特的信徒，一听到K线、一听到技术分析就是2个字：没用！\n\n真的没用么？\n\n当然也不是\n\n我交易也看K线，K线能表达很多信息，藏着的是多空的博弈过程：\n\n同样一条K线，它的形成过程能演绎出无穷的变化，能够给交易者传达不同的信息。它可能是先跌后涨多军压制空军，也可能是先涨后跌行情高开低走，也可以是经过了反反复复的震荡...\n\n![同一条K线，其形成变化万千](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dyKdoen-RJwU0istkQSff.png?height=165&width=720)\n\n市场是不可预测的，你不可能准确判定价格是涨还是跌，但不管它怎样走你都应该有自己的对策。\n\n作为一个交易者最重要的是形成并完善自己的交易策略！\n\nK线是辅助你判断的，不能帮你预测！\n\n我们再来回忆一下本间宗久的酒田五法，其中描述的K线型态：\n\n谁说涨了3天（红三兵）就要继续涨？\n\n谁说出现了M型（头肩顶）就不会再次飞？\n\n谁说连续跳跌3天就还要继续跌？\n\n你能找到100次K线形态套进去很准的历史行情，就能找到100次它在跑飞机！\n\n我相信市面上还是有一些老师分析得很专业的，也不会跟你随便预测！但我不知道是哪些，因为我从来不听他们BB！\n\n我只知道市场变幻莫测！\n\n酒田战法、风林火山在变幻莫测的市场面前有没有卵用本身就要打个巨大的问号？\n\nK线是不带任何感情色彩的价格统计及展示工具！\n\n**是日本智慧带给全世界的珍贵遗产！**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_tkaq6HbfNQGRb4v-cGDN.png?height=68&width=720)\n\n转载请注明出处，写作不易，如果对你有帮助请随意打赏：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4uYJYnSqpwC0_P_JrKaf5.png?height=235&width=720)\n\nBTC地址：bc1qkj5ms07nw68tg20pyft6xl2ghe2qylw466ug8u\n\nETH/USDT/USDC地址：0xaf5624ebc8023f457b67eb3f50c560a606bf5582\n\nDOGE地址：DHboLCa8diAn1DoJ4KCM5958q9KRg9EBha",

STEPN, uno de los mejores juegos de M2E, ha ganado un enorme 31 000 % en ganancias después de su venta de tokens en Binance Launchpad el 2 de marzo.\n\nSTEPN combina elementos de Social-Fi y Game-Fi en una aplicación de estilo de vida Web3. Al caminar, trotar o correr al aire libre, puedes ganar GST, el token del juego, que se puede utilizar para subir de nivel y acuñar nuevas zapatillas de deporte.\n\nFuente‍\n‍\n\nUn Breve Trasfondo\n\nSatoshi Lab, la empresa matriz de STEPN, fue fundada en 2021 por Jerry Huang y Yawn Rong. Tras una campaña de reclutamiento en septiembre de 2021, el equipo de STEPN quedó en cuarto lugar en el Solana Ignition Hackathon en diciembre de 2021, atrayendo el interés de los inversores.\n\nDespués, STEPN recaudó 5 millones de dólares en financiación de la ronda inicial de 6th Man Ventures, Alameda Research, Corner Ventures y otros. La plataforma M2E obtuvo ganancias sustanciales de 26,8 millones de dólares en el primer trimestre de 2022, a medida que aumentaba el número de cuentas únicas en la plataforma.\n\n‍\n\nEmpezando Por La Aplicación STEPN\n\n1. Descargar e instalar STEPN\n\nEmpieza demasiado, dirígete al sitio web de STEPN. Puedes descargar la aplicación para Android o iOS pulsando el botón de descarga.\n\nFuente\n‍2. Crear una cuenta\n\nUna vez finalizada la instalación, tendrás que registrarte con tu dirección de correo electrónico. Ahora recibirás un código de verificación en tu correo electrónico. Después de introducir el código, pulsa Iniciar sesión en el plazo de un minuto.\n\nDespués de eso, STEPN pedirá el código de activación. El código de activación de STEPN se puede encontrar en el servidor STEPN Discord, STEPN Reddit y muchos otros foros de discusión sobre criptomonedas.\n\nFuente: Aplicación STEPN\n‍3. Crear una cartera STEPN\n\nUna vez que haya completado el proceso de registro y código de activación, aterrizará en la página de inicio de la aplicación. La pantalla de tu móvil tendrá un icono de cartera en la esquina superior derecha. Púlsalo. Ahora verás dos pestañas: Gasto y Cartera. Haz clic en Wallet. Después de pulsar Wallet, aparecerá una ventana emergente. La frase semilla se puede utilizar para crear una nueva cartera o importar una existente.\n\nVamos con \"crear una nueva cartera\" dentro de la aplicación. Pulsa \"Crear una nueva cartera\". STEPN le pedirá que cree una contraseña que necesitará para bloquear/desbloquear su cartera. A continuación, verás una frase semilla. Además de almacenarlo digitalmente, guárdalo físicamente también. Su cartera STEPN será accesible para cualquier persona que conozca su frase semilla.\n\nFuente: Aplicación STEPN\n4\\. Transferir SOL a STEPN Wallet\n\nVaya a la cartera dentro de la aplicación y copie la dirección de recepción tocando \"Recibir\" después de establecer la contraseña y almacenar la frase semilla. Luego, ve a tu intercambio preferido para comprar y retirar $SOL. Pulsa Retirada en la app de la bolsa.\n\nIntroduzca la dirección de su cartera STEPN y la cantidad de SOL que desea enviar. A continuación, compruebe su cartera STEPN después de 5 minutos de completar la verificación.\n\n1. Consigue un par de zapatillas NFT\n\nPara ganar dinero en STEPN, debes comprar una NFT Sneaker que coincida con tu nivel de condición física.\n\nHay varias opciones disponibles:\n\nWalker (1-6 km/ h)\nJogger (4-10 km/ h)\nCorredor (8-20 km/ hora)\nEntrenador (1-20 km/ h)\nHay un mercado dentro de la aplicación donde puedes comprar las zapatillas NFT. Además de las zapatillas de deporte, también puedes comprar cajas de zapatos. Hay una zapatilla en una caja de zapatos al azar. En el momento de escribir este artículo, las zapatillas tienen un precio de piso de entre 2,14 $SOL y 2,55 $SOL (alrededor de 78 $ a 93).\n\nFuente: Aplicación STEPN\nEn total, actualmente necesitarás unos 2-3 $SOL para empezar con STEPN. Además del precio de las zapatillas de deporte, asegúrate de tener una pequeña cantidad de $SOL disponible para cubrir las tarifas de gasolina. Las devoluciones de $GST para cada zapatilla varían.\n\nLa página NFT Sneaker contiene todos los detalles, incluyendo:\n\nCalidad: Común, Poco Común, Raro, Épico, Legendario\nEficiencia: mejora las ganancias de tokens GST\nSuerte: mejora la tasa de caída de la caja misteriosa\nComodidad: mejora las ganancias de los tokens GMT (en el nivel 30)\nResiliencia: reduce los costes de reparación\n\nFuente: Aplicación STEPN\n‍6. Sal a correr afuera\n\nDespués de conseguir tu NFT Sneaker, usa el GPS mientras corres, caminas o trotas afuera. Ganarás ganancias garantizadas si tu señal GPS es fuerte. Una señal GPS baja o ninguna señal dará lugar a ganancias bajas o nulas. La aplicación está diseñada para detectar y hacer caso omiso de los movimientos no orgánicos (es decir, usar un scooter eléctrico o atar el teléfono a su perro). Además, debes mantener la velocidad óptima dependiendo de la zapatilla que elijas.\n\n1. Quemar $GST/$GMT\n\nEn STEPN, quemar $GST significa gastarlo.\n\nPuedes subir de nivel tus zapatillas con $GST/$GMT ganado para hacerlas más eficientes.\nPuedes quedarte o vender las zapatillas de acuñadas.\n$GST/$GMT se puede cambiar por $USDC.\nExaminemos ahora la tokenómica de STEPN.\n\n‍\n\nTokenomics\nEl modelo económico de criptomoneda STEPN consta de dos tokens. $GST es el token de utilidad utilizado para pagar las recompensas dentro de la aplicación. El token tiene un suministro ilimitado, pero se quema cada vez que se acuña, repara o actualiza.\n\nCon un límite máximo de oferta de 6 mil millones, el token Green Metaverse ($GMT) es el token de gobernanza de STEPN y el principal almacén de valor para los inversores.\n\nSegún un calendario de adquisición hasta marzo de 2030, el suministro de GMT se asigna de la siguiente manera:\n\n30 % a recompensas dentro de la aplicación\n30 % retenido en la tesorería\n16,3 % reservado para ventas privadas\n14,2 % retenido por el equipo\n7 % reservado para la venta de la plataforma de lanzamiento de Binance\nSe dio un 2,5 % a los asesores.\n\nFuente‍\nLos titulares de GMT pueden apostar sus fichas para participar en las rondas de votación. En una votación colectiva, los titulares de tokens decidieron donar un porcentaje de tokens a un programa de compensación de carbono.\n\nLas recompensas generalmente se pagan en GST, pero ciertos parámetros, como tener zapatillas de deporte de nivel 30, permiten que se ganen en GMT. Con el tiempo, la tasa de emisión de tokens disminuye debido a varios mecanismos, incluido un calendario de reducción a la mitad.\n\n‍\n\nCaracterísticas adicionales\nCajas misteriosas\n\nLas cajas misteriosas se dejan caer al azar mientras te mueves en modo Solo. Contiene $GST y gemas (nivel 1 a 3). Cada usuario tiene cuatro ranuras Mystery Box. Hay 10 cualidades de Mystery Boxes. Al recibir una Caja Misteriosa, la cuenta atrás comienza automáticamente. Cuando termina la cuenta atrás, los usuarios gastan una pequeña cantidad de $GST (un \"costo base\") para abrirla. La duración de la cuenta atrás aumenta con la calidad de una caja misteriosa.\n\nCalidad de las zapatillas de deporte\n\nHay cinco cualidades de Sneakers (Común, Poco común, Raro, Épico y Legendario). Cuando se acuña una zapatilla, el valor de cada atributo se elige aleatoriamente entre los valores mínimos y máximos dictados por la calidad de la zapatilla. Por lo tanto, incluso las zapatillas de deporte de la misma calidad pueden tener niveles de atributo significativamente diferentes. Los usuarios necesitan quemar $GMT para subir de nivel sus zapatillas cuando se alcancen ciertos hitos.\n\n‍Acuñación de zapatos\n\nDurante un evento de acuñación de zapatos (SME), los usuarios utilizan dos zapatillas de deporte que poseen como planos para \"reírse\", creando una caja de zapatos. Como referencia, las dos zapatillas se llamarán Vintages (Padres).\n\nPara iniciar una PYME, ambas Vintage deben estar en posesión del usuario (no arrendadas) y ser totalmente duraderas. A continuación, los usuarios pueden seleccionar una zapatilla con la que \"regar\" visitando la pestaña Menta, seleccionando la zapatilla y pulsando Menta. Ambas cosechas tienen un tiempo de reutilización de acuñación de 72 horas, aunque todavía se pueden utilizar para el movimiento durante este período. Obtén información sobre los costes de acuñación aquí.\n\nFuente‍\n‍\n\nModos de juego\nModo Solo\n\nLos usuarios ganan tokens en modo Solo usando zapatillas NFT. Se requiere energía para ganar $GST. La energía se repone solo después de que los usuarios adquieran una NFT Sneaker: 1 La energía equivale a 5 minutos de movimiento Move-to-Earn.\n\nModo Maratón (en Desarrollo)\n\nEl modo Maratón requiere que los usuarios se registren en la pestaña Maratón con 24 horas de antelación. Las maratones se celebrarán tanto semanal como mensualmente. Obtén más información sobre las maratones semanales y las maratones mensuales aquí.\n\n‍\n\nLa recesión del mercado afecta a STEPN\nEl precio de los tokens STEPN se ha desvanado junto con el mercado bajista general, ya que tanto el token de gobierno como el token de utilidad han bajado entre el 80% y el 98% desde sus máximos históricos a principios de este año. En su punto máximo en abril, $GMT y $GST fueron de 4,19 $ y 9,36 $, respectivamente. Desde entonces, ambos tokens han tenido una tendencia a la baja, y la situación parece sombría.\n\nFuente: Gráfico de tokens GST\n\nFuente: Gráfico de tokens GMT\nAlgunos miembros de la comunidad atribuyen los dramáticos descensos de los tokens a la prohibición de la aplicación STEPN en China.\n\n\"Desde que China prohibió el juego, ha sido una masacre, y los precios han caído significativamente, tanto que para los pequeños corredores/caminantes, apenas vale la pena salir a caminar\". Un usuario de STEPN y contacto cercano de BSC News dijo. \"El precio de Solana y GST ha bajado, y los zapatos se han vuelto muy baratos (tomando una pérdida significativa en mis zapatos)\".\nEn el punto álgido de la popularidad de STEPN, los usuarios podrían ganar cientos de dólares trotando por el barrio en modo Solo. Fue posible ganar recompensas diarias de NFT de 3-4 $GST al precio máximo de 9,36 $, incluso con una zapatilla básica. Actualmente, la misma caminata, que habría ganado a los usuarios hasta 40 dólares en abril, solo produce unos 0,82 $.\n\nAnteriormente, con las NFT de Solana costando alrededor de 600 dólares, obtener un ROI positivo tardaba aproximadamente 16 días. Pero actualmente, cuesta alrededor de 69,88 $ comprar la zapatilla más barata a partir del 14 de julio. En el precio actual, los inversores tardarían unos 145 días en alcanzar el equilibrio con un rendimiento de 0,70 $ al día. Como resultado, hay sentimientos bajistas entre algunos de los miembros de la comunidad.\n\n“Algunos siguen jugando... Quiero decir, todavía falta un mes para la prohibición... si estuviera en China, jugaría cómodamente y esperaría hasta el 10 de julio para dejar mis zapatillas e irme\". Uno de los miembros de la comunidad de STEPN Discord dijo.\n‍\n\nUn impulso positivo\nAunque las condiciones del mercado criptográfico disminuyeron en los últimos meses, los beneficios del segundo trimestre de STEPN fueron de 122,5 millones de dólares, declaró la compañía en una publicación de Medium.\n\nFuente\nEl protocolo M2E planea aprovechar el 5 % de sus beneficios para iniciar un programa de recompra y quema de sus tokens GMT. Sin embargo, para evitar una volatilidad repentina de los precios, el proceso de recompra y quema \"puede tardar unas semanas en completarse\".\n\nAdemás, los desarrolladores declararon que STEPN asignaría reservas de capital para mejorar las características existentes y construir el equipo además del programa de recompra y quema. A pesar de los desafíos del protocolo, muchas personas siguen siendo optimistas.\n\n\"Si el equipo de STEPN finaliza su producto y comienza una gran campaña de marketing, las cosas aún podrían volver a subir. La parte de ganar dinero para salir a caminar o correr es atractiva para muchas personas, simplemente aún no lo saben, o aún no se sienten cómodas con el uso de una billetera criptográfica\", dijo un miembro de STEPN cercano a BSC News. \"Para que STEPN tenga éxito, creo que tendrán que hacer una gran campaña de marketing dirigida a personas sin experiencia en el espacio criptográfico, y creo que deberían ofrecer una cartera de custodia para las personas que no conocen las claves privadas y demás\".\nSTEPN informó que la compañía había identificado varias áreas para invertir su capital ganado para que se pudiera mejorar el juego. Entre ellos se encuentran las mejoras de seguridad, los mecanismos antitrampas para evitar que los bots ganen GMT, la creación del desarrollador y el equipo central, y la obtención de patrocinios y asociaciones.\n\n“Invertí mucho. No me preocupan los rendimientos ahora, ya que estoy concentrado a largo plazo. En este momento, estoy aumentando mis posesiones en ambas cadenas, aumentando mis zapatos principales y preparándome para el tercer reino\", declaró un miembro de la comunidad.\nTras los éxitos en el Reino SOL y el Reino BNB, STEPN tiene la intención de introducir el Reino APE en Ethereum.\n\nEl equipo de STEPN describe este Reino como \"un gran experimento para abrazar la moda y otras comunidades de NFT\".\nEl Reino APE proporcionará acceso a un nuevo Reino innovador para todos los usuarios de STEPN, centrándose en la accesibilidad y trayendo nuevos usuarios.\n\nFuente: Hoja de ruta de STEPN\n‍\n\nPensamientos de despedida\nDebido a la recesión de la industria, así como a las leyes de datos chinas que prohíben el almacenamiento de datos GPS de los ciudadanos, STEPN tuvo que bloquear a los usuarios chinos. Además, la plataforma de STEPN ha estado sujeta a una serie de ataques distribuidos de denegación de servicio (DDoS) desde su lanzamiento, lo que hace que se advierta a los usuarios de que \"los entrenamientos no se registren correctamente\" durante los períodos de mantenimiento.\n\nSin embargo, los mercados criptográficos podrían ver cómo moverse a los ingresos se convierte en un sector en auge si STEPN supera estos obstáculos. Además, si sus incentivos económicos motivan a algunas personas a levantarse de sus sofás y ponerse en marcha, eso es algo bueno.\n\nFuente‍\nLa comunidad STEPN es increíblemente activa en las redes sociales, con más de 640 000 seguidores solo en Twitter. Muchos usuarios crean una alta liquidez en el mercado de NFT, lo que hace que las zapatillas niveladas sean mucho más fáciles de vender.

{"id": "fsYrhWCkwdoLgMWbf7Clx4iyctCDmPDMsmFyLLVYlk4", "title": "The Apocalypse Amongst Us", "body": "### \"Let there be light, and it was so\" was the first meme and the artwork of Apocalypse Art shows us the way\n\n![Elder-1, by Apocalypse Art https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xd60e8125558a4022e7fd0a2a456f27a3b8b6fd07/20](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VkUuTbEvlibpm7YhZ9Kbs.png?height=499&width=600)\n\nI bet I know the first time you saw the word Apocalypse. You were watching a news show on TV or you saw a news headline and you saw references to a wildfire or a bomb explosion or the incineration of a village and the media sayeth: “Apocalyptic!”.\n\nBeing the good semiotic student you are, you, like me, probably assumed the media knew what they were talking about and that “apocalypse” and its derivatives meant utter and end of the world destruction. Indeed, there is a modern definition of apocalypse that states this is true.\n\nBut the origin of the English word apocalypse is actually similar to the first memes of Genesis, book 1, as written in the King James Bible:\n\n![Apokaluptein: to uncover](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ejeS4BCbHVA4BcjkwDZQx.png?height=189&width=466)\n\n![The King James Version of the Bible captures this meaning quite well, and in a nuanced way](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AjOHWPTlAr4LaxMv2Qadq.png?height=718&width=1250)\n\nThe idea of meaning and visual senses combining together to reveal a truth that has a transformative experience on us through art first came to [Apocalypse Art](https://twitter.com/apocalypticform) when he was 21 years old visiting the National Gallery in London.\n\nHe saw Raphael’s [Mond Crucifixion](https://colourlex.com/project/raphael-mond-crucifixion/).\n\n> “The Christ is on the cross but floating; the blood is pouring but there is no trace of violence. The angels, the people, the sun and moon — it is as if the whole thing is a divine puzzle, beautifully put together and full of meaning, but hard to decipher. And then I heard the figure under the cross speaking — grumbling sort of, or lamenting. Not with my ears, you understand — but inwardly. This was a very strange and vivid experience. I looked away, it stopped; I look again, and the speaking began again.”\n\nIn his work, many of the pieces have figures like this “grumbling” one at the foot of the Christ, but they seem to be central figures, grounded, or close to the foreground, but also featured prominently.\n\nIt may be a bit of a leap, but these half-emerged figures seem to be the embodiment of the speaking figure, not the Christ itself, but a witness to Him.\n\nSometimes they even seem far away, in the midst of the landscape, as if the artist is trying to figure out just what to let emerge, when and where.\n\nIt’s an interesting mind twist, because you can imagine the artist dreaming him up, and intentionally placing him there, a bit at a distance, asking or waiting for permission to encounter.\n\nBut there is one digital work he has done that is really striking for how it blends together the colour matching of the Mond Crucifixion (though a little brighter) and the dreamy, revelatory floating of his first experience.\n\nIt’s “[Redemption](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x4802bd775674f0638e850e6ab00d79e3341107d0/9),” which is part of a series he calls “The [Meeings](https://opensea.io/collection/apocalypse-art-meeings)”.\n\n![Redemption](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MRL1pRwiSSqK8Xaq5ubo7.png?height=968&width=600)\n\nHere are two witnesses to the Christ figure painted like skeletons, and in their hypermodern colours it seems clear that these are not created out of an atavistic view of life (not looking back), but as if something has been brought forward.\n\nThe skeleton represents an avatar, from the Sanskrit, avatara, or stepping down to cross over. [Apocalypse Art](https://twitter.com/apocalypticform) tells me:\n\n> I started drawing skeletons many years ago when I was teaching myself to draw. I found that the skeleton conveyed a human being, but a part of us that is invisible. \n>\n> The skeleton is often associated with death, because if you see someone’s skeleton, that person is dead. But when a skeleton is standing or running or praying, and then it’s closer to a ghost or a spirit. So it is two things: the physical part of us that survives death, but also a representation of the spiritual part of us that survives death. \n\nHere, the skeletons are a pair, and they are in side profile.\n\n> “When I represent a skeleton, I am calling on the viewer’s innate knowledge, perhaps mostly forgotten, that they too are not only a physical being but also an inner being. Sufficient experience of this “inwardness” can open all kinds of doors.”\n\nEmerging between the pair is a beam of light, the kind of holy and piercing stimulus you see in a Loie Hollowell painting, where you forget the physics of light and receive it as a guttural and sensual stimulation.\n\nIt very much looks as if a portal has opened, but interestingly there is no figure or representation that indicates an aperture. One can believe that one exists, though.\n\nSomething otherworldly but also intimately human emerges during this cast of light. You can see it in many other paintings. Spirit-hood.\n\n> There is definitely a spiritual quality to my work. Not a spiritual as in woo-woo new age, but spiritual as in a larger frame of reference for humanity and life. Francis Bacon’s work is spiritual too, for example, even though his work focuses mostly on the “isolation, horror, and loneliness” spectrum of spiritual reality. My work attempts to span a larger spectrum, including all the heavens and hells that humans experience in their ages long journey.\n>\n> It’s a mythology if you will, but of course, myths are true from certain points of view.\n\nHis current work falls into this and three other series, some of which have not been completed or even minted yet: [On opensea are the Meeings, the Editions, and a collection of Sketches, Derivatives, and Collaborations](https://opensea.io/ApocalypseArt?tab=created). There will be a few more series art, soon. They all travel through this mythological exploration.\n\nThey all seem to be painted with deep appreciation for their ability to illuminate the thinking of the artist and his emotional work with the digital canvas, but also they seem to present themselves well as works of gratitude given to the audience.\n\nOne can’t help but think in the presence of such work that art is unapologetically good to us.\n\nBut we seem to never ask why. Is it because the answer we will receive will stun us, the way a young man of 21 was stunned in the National Gallery of London when he first saw, not real blood, but the blood of an artist, illuminated in oil?\n\nHe was forever changed. Are we afraid of being changed? Or, is it that we just don’t know we can be changed, deserved to be changed? Not in a “come to Christ” moment, but in a “come to seeing” moment.\n\nWe are back with [Apocalypse Art](https://twitter.com/apocalypticform) when he was in the National Gallery looking at Raphael’s work hung on poplar wood:\n\n“At this moment, I thought, I want my art to speak like this. I can almost hear this painting!” he says.\n\n“So I’m plodding along doing my best to get there. Some people have lately told me they could feel the wind in the work, and things like that. So maybe we’re getting somewhere,” he says.\n\nBy the way, in Redemption, the door is the two figures, standing apart, to let the light in between them.\n\nNow look. Again. Closer. In Raphael’s Mond Crucifixion, the painting is the door to consciousness. This is true for every work of art.\n\nOpen the door.\n\n![Raphael's Mond Crucifixion, 1502-3](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vJpMXeNRb1DSqKevvDy_r.png?height=835&width=500)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658403823, "digest": "WASCUfXTP7ZG5D-r8jQcq48_j7GVQ6cPcE-ydKc6v48", "contributor": "0x753e9283e7bD8Be3a74097B7186Ea9DeFFAEe071"}

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第九篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并持续推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一次周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n原文：\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n编译：\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n### 第十篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】What is a Social Recovery Wallet?\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n【个人思考】\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://hackernoon.com/what-is-a-social-recovery-wallet](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-a-social-recovery-wallet)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658405405, "digest": "l79R1AAIVo2G6IdJPNutRMHobqqd35_gDVwWAUyBM5o", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

Let’s dive in\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe crypto and blockchain space has gone through a notable need, that starting from last year, tackled into the market; the quest for Scalabilty, and above all through a highly performant Layer 1 blockchain.\n\nThis last one has led to a vertical commit, oriented to the possibility of overcoming Ethereum thanks to innovation, and at the same time differentiating from it, becoming so a new star in what is the blockchain universe and ultimately embracing a multi-chain enviroment where every ambient, or blockchain ecosystem, is enhanced for its strengts and own features and have relationships with other ambients through communication protocols which manage an effective and efficient inter-operability, that finally bring value-making connections (Cosmos has been surely a promoter of this narrative and philosophy).\n\nNow, this situation is a link for the alternative L1 aiming at being non-EVM, and at solving the so called “Blockchain Trilemma” that has to offer a great and co-operative rapport and synthesis of 3 core values: Decentralization, Security and Scalability.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/agB8cfI3hGbsLWtAHxQkJ.png?height=509&width=907)\n\nMany blockchain projects arised, and in 2022 some of these reached top market cap positions, spreading throughout 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, the L1 Mania. A linear disillusion came clearer, problem after problem; Solana has been offline 5 times in 2022, Elrond got exploited through the Maiar DEX, Terra died etc.\n\nBut innovation was also introduced in crypto markets thanks to L1 competition, that saw scalable blockchains oriented to increase TVL and so gaining more market share, to further improve when overcoming a certain threshold of active users and investors.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3PU4uKekBZvkj4sRtjyee.jpg?height=595&width=1080)\n\nWe could in fact see how innovation, despite the bear market, still remains high.\n\nSo among every value, Scalability covered a prevalent position in the Blockchain innovation, specifically one that would be cheap, fast and with a great UX. This last value played, and is playing, a fundamental role in the contribution of two complementary trends, aiming toward scaling DeFi adoption and more in general Web3 applications’ one. These initiatives take place by the need of something highly performant, that could provide potentially many sub-initiatives with related and annexed use-cases. Another need comes out to have a “clearer, but builder and dev-friendly use” of what is made within blockchain.\n\nThe first trend therefore is related and oriented to “masses”, because since scalability is enhanced, this one could handle more users.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DTLuVG24oPGKF6ORRQ_Wh.png?height=776&width=1275)\n\nNow, the word “Mass” (considered out of Astro-Physics) is nowadays definetely over-used, such that it has usually gained negative connotations while actually a mass is an amorphous subject made of individuals, the context give identity to. Coming back to its use in the blockchain space and how could it identify a trend, try to notice the bio of blockchain projects or L1s; “the blockchain for the next 1b users” or again “the next-gen blockchain for masses”.\n\nThis little trick soon reveals the second connected trend, that as said before, not only reaches a high quantity of TPS (Transactions per second), but also builds an infrastructure that embraces a general-purpose logic. These type of projects can host DeFi, GameFi, NFT projects and so on, all with a Web3 approach as a base. There could be the possibility also to aggregate all the projects and applications into a great and big interface, like a Menu that gives an orderly access to the whole ecosystem.\n\nWe can find a parallel use of unification to a better and simple user experience in NFT Aggregators, like Genie or Gem. Again, the Binance Half-Year Report of 2022 shows how this specific sector has seen an uptrend in market share, rising from 1% to 5% market share:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D5GD80yNrHG8FsiP89szz.jpg?height=648&width=1080)\n\nThat said, recently two startups are strongly jumping on the visions introduced above - Aptos Labs and Mysten Labs\n\nThese two startups have a common point; they were founded by ex-Meta employees who worked at the blockchain side of Meta called Novi.\n\n## Aptos Labs - the Diem Case\n\nAptos Labs is a blockchain project (L1) that is trying to solve the Blockchain Trilemma, and whose mission is to build a scalable, secure, decentralized and cheap blockchain. A partnership with Google Cloud has been made, in order to let anyone powering a node in 15 min or less.

Diem in fact, the blockchain Meta was trying to build in order to onboard its 2+ bn userbase toward and into this technologic solution and “virtual world”, has been stopped and while a part of the technology has been sold, the rest was turned open-sourced.\n\nSo, Aptos Labs decided to take advantage of the work done and not to waste the tech; they decided therefore to use it as a pillar to develop and build on, adding further improvements and other features.\n\nThe two ex-Meta employees or Aptos founders Mo Shaikh - formerly Head of Partnerships at Meta . and Avery Ching - formerly Principal Software Engineer at Meta’s internal Blockchain Solution . have raised 200M$ with Aptos, in a funding round confirmed in March 2022, with big VCs and Investors like MultiCoin Capital, Coinbase Ventures, FTX Ventures, Binance Labs and more, but among these investors there was also PayPal, with its first investment in a base layer.

Currently a Tesnet program is live and it is divided into 4 phases of AIT (Aptos Incentivized Tesnet). This program wants to scale up validators in order to be ready for the mainnet launch, find bugs and fix them, securing the fact that the mass-scale amount of TPS (currently 150k+ on testnet) will be the same in the mainnet as well, and obviously attracting devs and users for a better start and bootstrap.\n\nA unique feature of Aptos can be found in its code language - Move. It was built 3+ years ago and designed for safe asset management. It’s more versatile than Solidity and simple to use, but with a strong eye for performance and security. It so allows zero downtime updates of both the Aptos Network and the Aptos Move Framework.\n\nThe Aptos ecosystem, also thanks to Move is growing rapidly. Yet 100 projects are building on Aptos. Here some of them:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vfupVtubXSflu8Dy4YBBg.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nMany other protocols are deciding to build on Aptos, so this interest fan really represent an opportunity to see and study an ecosystem’s growth and evolution. Furthermore it will be very interesting to see how this project is going to impact the space. Is Aptos going to be something detached from what is going on with Ethereum for instance (the L2 narrative, scalability solutions etc…) ?\n\n**Another Former-Meta employees’ Blockchain - Mysten Labs**\n\nMysten Labs is born in a similar way Aptos did. The startup was in fact formed by four ex-Meta employees who decided to quit the job and build their own blockchain through the ashes left by Diem.\n\nMysten Labs’ blockchain is called Sui, its scope is that of building infrastructure completely aligned with the Web3 philosophy andò ethic, allowing with the high scalability, the mass-adoption. Like Aptos, Sui as well utilizes Move as a language, so the competition between the two won’t be negligible. We are going to call them “the (ex)Meta wars”; this will likely represent another case study to look for.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iFML_CB_TRx-SvWx0rWvs.png?height=900&width=1200)\n\nTalking of funding, Mysten has raised 36M$ in a Series A round led by Andreessen Horowitz in December 2021, while now is about to raise 200M$ in a Series B funding round led by FTX Ventures. Source: \n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/11/web-3-startup-mysten-labs-aiming-for-2b-valuation-in-latest-funding-report/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/11/web-3-startup-mysten-labs-aiming-for-2b-valuation-in-latest-funding-report/)\n\nAs we can see who is less suffering the bear market, is making strategic investments or acquisitions. A related data analysis to look in parallel with this last narrative, is the funding in the DeFi space, that at the time writing is at all-time high:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KF5XPqxvvK-KntMvXOEPo.jpg?height=681&width=1080)\n\nThe Sui blockchain is having a rather big mediatic exposure, on Twitter more than others. As for Aptos, Sui is witnessing a growing number of projects built on top of it. Very recently, for instance, Ethos wallet has announced its birth and motivated why they chose Sui, and therefore simplicity, friendly and intuitive UX and the possibility of surfing the wave of an early stage project full of growth potential.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ae794lYJPvh69_kopfANy.jpg?height=789&width=1384)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VlSOHduzx2Bqfsjzzn2Ft.jpg?height=500&width=1500)\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nAptos and Mysten are surely two projects to keep an eye on, also because their investors are strong expert in the crypto and web3 sector and could really help in their progress and growth.\n\nAnother point of interest is linked with the current situation which sees a progress in zk roll-ups technology (zk-EVM), see Polygon announcement: \n\n[https://twitter.com/0xPolygon/status/1549716947847479302?t=TmVF-uartXkpeYDDXiXYyQ&s=19](https://twitter.com/0xPolygon/status/1549716947847479302?t=TmVF-uartXkpeYDDXiXYyQ&s=19)\n\nIt will be curious to see how the L2 train will be managed by the two start-ups.\n\nFinally the competition and following strategies to innovate and grow may represent or form new marketing Web3-related incentives, vampire-attacks design, application and preference-making or preference-switching (from a protocol to another) design strategies.\n\nI hope you liked this and learned something new✔️\n\n • Also follow me on Medium: \n\n[https://t.co/HwVV3Ijy2Z](https://t.co/HwVV3Ijy2Z)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658406857, "digest": "fOadiNx-ZJxM-Gy4Yg5bvQgb7hJeJZqSoNe4iBvq-p8", "contributor": "0xb848281a1a1F1f018814279F6966e8f8D6955463"}

Plus](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*7upJf6TmTe_MAXXT_gWTUw.jpeg)\n\n### สองยุคแรกของอินเตอร์เน็ต\n\nในช่วงยุคแรกของอินเตอร์เน็ต ซึ่งเริ่มจากช่วงประมาณทศวรรษที่ 1980 ถึงประมาณช่วงต้นทศวรรษที่ 2000 บริการบนอินเตอร์เน็ตถูกสร้างขึ้นบนโพรโตคอลแบบเปิดซึ่งถูกควบคุมโดยชุมชนอินเตอร์เน็ต จึงกล่าวได้ว่าผู้คนหรือองค์กรสามารถขยายฐานตัวตนบนโลกอินเตอร์เน็ตของตัวเองได้อย่างมั่นใจว่ากฎของเกมนี้จะไม่เปลี่ยนในภายหลัง เว็บพร็อพเพอร์ตี้ (web property) ขนาดใหญ่ถูกบุกเบิกในยุคนี้ อาทิ ยาฮู้, กูเกิ้ล, แอมะซอน, เฟสบุ้ก, ลิงค์อิน และยูทูป โดยในระหว่างทาง ความสำคัญของแพลตฟอร์มแบบรวมศูนย์อย่างเอโอแอลก็ได้ลดลงอย่างมหาศาล\n\nในช่วงยุคที่สองของอินเตอร์เน็ต ตั้งแต่กลางทศวรรษที่ 2000 จวบจนถึงปัจจุบัน บริษัทเทคที่แสวงหากำไร นำโดย กูเกิ้ล, แอปเปิ้ล, เฟสบุ้ก, และอะแมซอน (หรือที่รู้จักกันในนามกลุ่ม GAFA - Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) ได้สร้างซอฟต์แวร์และบริการที่แซงหน้าขีดความสามารถของโพรโตคอลแบบเปิดไปได้อย่างรวดเร็ว การเติบโตอย่างก้าวกระโดดของสมาร์ตโฟน ยิ่งเร่งความเร็วให้แก่เทรนด์นี้เมื่อโมบายล์แอปได้กลายเป็นช่องทางการใช้งานหลักของอินเตอร์เน็ต จนในที่สุดผู้ใช้งานก็โยกย้ายจากบริการแบบเปิด มายังบริการแบบรวมศูนย์ที่ถูกพัฒนาจนมีความซับซ้อนมากกว่า และแม้ว่าผู้ใช้จะยังคงใช้งานโพรโตคอลแบบเปิดอย่างเว็บ แต่พวกเขากลับมักจะเข้าผ่านช่องทางซอฟต์แวร์และบริการของกลุ่ม GAFA อยู่ดี\n\nข่าวดีก็คือ คนหลายพันล้านสามารถเข้าถึงเทคโนโลยีมหัศจรรย์เหล่านี้ได้ ซึ่งส่วนใหญ่มักจะเปิดให้ใช้งานโดยไม่มีค่าใช้จ่าย แต่ข่าวร้ายที่ตามก็คือ มันกลายเป็นเรื่องที่ยากมากสำหรับสตาร์ทอัพ ครีเอเตอร์ และคนกลุ่มอื่นๆ ในการขยายตัวตนบนอินเตอร์เน็ตของพวกเขาโดยปราศจากความกังวลว่า แพลตฟอร์มแบบรวมศูนย์จะหันมาเปลี่ยนกฎใส่พวกเขากลางอากาศ หรือพรากผู้ติดตามและยึดกำไรของพวกเขาไป ประเด็นนี้กลับกลายเป็นสิ่งที่ฉุดรั้งการพัฒนานวัตกรรม และทำให้ความน่าสนใจและพลวัตของอินเตอร์เน็ตถดถอยลงไป นอกจากนั้น การรวมศูนย์ยังสร้างความตึงเครียดภายในสังคมระดับกว้าง อย่างที่เราได้เห็นจากการถกเถียงเกี่ยวกับประเด็น เช่น ข่าวปลอม, บอตที่ถูกสนับสนุนโดยรัฐ, การทำให้ผู้ใช้งาน “ไม่ให้มีที่ยืน”, กฎหมายว่าด้วยความเป็นส่วนตัวของสหภาพยุโรป และความลำเอียงที่เกิดจากอัลกอริทึม การถกเถียงเช่นนี้มีแต่จะรุนแรงขึ้นภายในไม่อีกกี่ปีข้างหน้า\n\n### “เว็บ 3”: ยุคที่สามของอินเตอร์เน็ต\n\nหนึ่งวิธีในการโต้กลับต่อการรวมศูนย์เช่นนี้คือ การบังคับใช้กฎระเบียบของภาครัฐกับบริษัทอินเตอร์เน็ตขนาดใหญ่ การตอบโต้เช่นนี้ตั้งอยู่บนข้อสันนิฐานว่า อินเตอร์เน็ตมีลักษณะที่คล้ายกับเครือข่ายการสื่อสารจากยุคก่อนๆ อย่าง โทรศัพท์ วิทยุ และเครือข่ายโทรทัศน์ แต่พวกเครือข่ายจากยุคก่อนที่สร้างอยู่บนฮาร์ดแวร์เหล่านี้ มีพื้นฐานที่แตกต่างกับอินเตอร์เน็ตที่เป็นเครือข่ายที่สร้างอยู่บนซอฟต์แวร์โดยสิ้นเชิง หากเครือข่ายที่สร้างอยู่บนฮาร์ดแวร์ถูกสร้างขึ้นแล้ว มันก็แทบจะเป็นไปไม่ได้เลยที่สถาปัตยกรรมของพวกมันจะถูกรื้อสร้างใหม่ แต่สถาปัตยกรรมของเครือข่ายที่สร้างอยู่บนซอฟต์แวร์ สามารถถูกรื้อสร้างได้ด้วยนวัตกรรมของผู้ประกอบการ และพลังของตลาด\n\nอินเตอร์เน็ตเป็นเครือข่ายที่สร้างอยู่บนซอฟต์แวร์อย่างแท้จริง มันประกอบไปด้วย[แกนชั้นใน](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol)ที่เชื่อมต่อกับคอมพิวเตอร์ซึ่งสามารถเขียนโปรแกรมได้อย่างเต็มสูบหลายพันล้านตัวที่ตั้งอยู่รอบนอก ซอฟต์แวร์แท้จริงแล้วก็คือการเข้ารหัสความคิดของมนุษย์นั่นเอง มันมีพื้นที่สำหรับการออกแบบที่ไร้ขีดจำกัด คอมพิวเตอร์ที่เชื่อมต่อกับอินเตอร์เน็ตโดยทั่วไป มักจะสามารถรันซอฟต์แวร์อะไรก็ได้ตามที่เจ้าของต้องการ ไม่ว่าจะเป็นสิ่งใดก็ตามที่จินตนาการจะไปถึง หากมีชุดแรงจูงใจที่ถูกต้องแล้ว มันจะสามารถแพร่พันธ์ุบนอินเตอร์เน็ตได้อย่างรวดเร็ว สถาปัตยกรรมของอินเตอร์เน็ตคือที่ที่ความคิดสร้างสรรค์ทางเทคนิค และการออกแบบแรงจูงใจมาบรรจบกัน\n\nอินเตอร์เน็ตยังอยู่ในช่วงต้นของวิวัฒนาการ และการบริการหลักบนอินเตอร์เน็ตก็คงจะโดนรื้อสร้างสถาปัตยกรรมกันใหม่เกือบทั้งหมดในอีกไม่กี่ทศวรรษข้างหน้า มันจะเกิดขึ้นได้ด้วยเครือข่ายคริปโตเอกโคโนมิก (cryptoeconomic) ซึ่งเป็นการกลั่นกรองแนวความคิด โดยเริ่มเป็นที่รู้จักผ่าน[บิตคอยน์](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) และถูกนำมาพัฒนาต่อยอดโดย[อีเธอเรียม](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) เครือข่ายคริปโต (cryptonetwork) ได้ผนวกคุณสมบัติที่ดีที่สุดจากสองยุคแรกของอินเตอร์เน็ตอย่างการปกครองโดยชุมชน และเครือข่ายกระจายศูนย์ที่มีศักยภาพมากพอที่จะสามารถแซงหน้าบรรดาบริการแบบรวมศูนย์ที่ก้าวหน้ามากที่สุดได้ในอนาคต\n\n### ทำไมถึงต้องกระจายศูนย์?\n\nการกระจายศูนย์ (decentralization) เป็นคอนเซปต์ที่มักจะถูกเข้าใจผิดกันอยู่บ่อยๆ ยกตัวอย่างเช่น ในบางครั้งมีการกล่าวว่าเหตุผลที่เครือข่ายคริปโตสนับสนุนให้เกิดการกระจายศูนย์เพื่อมาต่อต้านการถูกเซ็นเซอร์โดยภาครัฐ หรือเป็นเพราะว่ามุมมองทางการเมืองแบบอิสรนิยม (libertarian) อย่างไรก็ตาม นี่ไม่ใช่เหตุผลหลักที่ทำให้การกระจายศูนย์มีความสำคัญ\n\nลองมาดูปัญหาของแพลตฟอร์มแบบรวมศูนย์กันก่อน แพลตฟอร์มแบบรวมศูนย์มีวงจรชีวิตที่คาดเดาได้ ในช่วงที่เพิ่งเริ่มตั้งไข่ พวกมันจะทำทุกอย่างเพื่อระดมผู้ใช้งานและกลุ่มบุคคลที่สามที่จะมาช่วยทำให้แพลตฟอร์มสมบูรณ์ขึ้น เช่น นักพัฒนา ธุรกิจ และองค์กรสื่อ พวกมันทำเช่นนี้เพื่อให้บริการของตนมีคุณค่ามากขึ้น เนื่องจากแพลตฟอร์ม (ตามนิยามแล้ว) คือระบบที่เกิดจากผลกระทบเชิงเครือข่าย (network effect) ในหลากหลายมิติ ในขณะที่แพลตฟอร์มขยับขึ้นตามกราฟเอสเคิร์ฟ (s-curve) ของการใช้งาน อำนาจเหนือผู้ใช้งานและบุคคลที่สามของพวกมันก็เติบโตขึ้นเรื่อยๆ\n\nเมื่อแพลตฟอร์มขึ้นไปจนถึงจุดสูงสุดของกราฟเอสเคิร์ฟ ความสัมพันธ์ระหว่างพวกมันกับผู้มีส่วนร่วมภายในเครือข่ายก็เปลี่ยนจากเกมบวก (positive sum) กลายเป็นเกมศูนย์ (zero sum) วิธีที่ง่ายที่สุดที่จะเติบโตต่อไป คือการรีดไถข้อมูลจากผู้ใช้งาน และหันมาแข่งขันในด้านผู้ใช้งานและกำไรกับส่วนที่เดิมทีเคยช่วยแพลตฟอร์มสมบูรณ์ขึ้น กรณีตัวอย่างที่พบเจอในอดีตก็มี ไมโครซอฟท์ vs. เน็ตสเคป, กูเกิ้ล vs. เยิล์ป, เฟสบุ้ก vs. เซงก้า และทวิตเตอร์ vs. ไคลเอนต์บุคคลที่สาม ส่วนระบบปฏิบัติการอย่างไอโอเอส และแอนดรอยด์ ถึงจะประพฤติตัวดีกว่าผู้อื่น แต่ก็ยังเก็บภาษีอย่างเต็มเม็ดเต็มหน่วยถึง 30 เปอร์เซ็นต์ อีกทั้งยังปฏิเสธแอปด้วยเหตุผลที่ดูเหมือนเป็นการตัดสินตามความพึงพอใจ และยึดฟั่งชันก์การใช้งานจากแอปบุคคลที่สามให้มาอยู่ใต้อาณัติเมื่อต้องการ\n\nสำหรับบรรดาผู้มีส่วนร่วมบุคคลที่สามแล้ว การเปลี่ยนแปลงจากการร่วมมือเป็นการแข่งขันเช่นนี้ ทำให้พวกเขารู้สึกราวกับว่ามันคือกลโกงเบตแอนด์สวิตช์ (bait-and-switch) เมื่อเวลาล่วงเลยไป เหล่าผู้ประกอบการ นักพัฒนา และนักลงทุนชั้นเยี่ยมที่สุด ก็เริ่มแคลงใจที่จะสร้างอะไรบนแพลตฟอร์มแบบรวมศูนย์ ในปัจจุบัน เรามีหลักฐานจากหลายทศวรรษว่า การทำเช่นนั้นล้วนแต่จะจบลงด้วยความผิดหวังทั้งสิ้น นอกจากนั้นแล้ว ผู้ใช้งานยังต้องสละความเป็นส่วนตัวและอำนาจในการควบคุมข้อมูลของตัวเอง และยังต้องเจอความเสี่ยงจากช่องโหว่ด้านความปลอดภัยอีกด้วย ปัญหาเหล่านี้ของแพลตฟอร์มแบบรวมศูนย์มีความเป็นไปได้สูงว่าจะเป็นที่ประจักษ์มากขึ้นในอนาคต\n\n### เมื่อเครือข่ายคริปโตก้าวสู่สังเวียน\n\nเครือข่ายคริปโต คือเครือข่ายที่สร้างอยู่บนอินเตอร์เน็ต โดย 1) ใช้กลไกฉันทามติ (consensus mechanism) อย่างบล็อกเชนในการรักษาและอัพเดทสเตท 2) ใช้คริปโตเคอเรนซี (คอยน์/โทเคน) ในการสร้างแรงจูงใจให้ผู้มีส่วนร่วมกับระบบฉันทามติ (นักขุด (miner)/ วาลิเดเตอร์ (validator)) และผู้มีส่วนร่วมในด้านอื่นๆ เครือข่ายคริปโตบางเครือข่าย เช่น อีเธอเรียม คือแพลตฟอร์มสำหรับเขียนโปรแกรมทั่วไปที่สามารถนำไปใช้งานได้กับเกือบทุกวัตถุประสงค์ ส่วนเครือข่ายคริปโตอื่นๆ มีวัตถุประสงค์พิเศษ อาทิ บิตคอยน์เกิดมาด้วยความตั้งใจหลักในการเก็บรักษามูลค่า, [โกเลม (Golem)](https://www.golem.network/) เกิดมาเพื่อการคำนวณประมวลผล, และ[ไฟล์คอยน์ (Filecoin)](https://filecoin.io/) เกิดมาเพื่อเก็บรักษาไฟล์แบบกระจายศูนย์\n\nโพโตคอลอินเตอร์เน็ตในช่วงยุคบุกเบิก คือข้อมูลจำเพาะทางเทคนิคที่ถูกสร้างขึ้นโดยกลุ่มทำงานหรือองค์กรที่ไม่แสวงหากำไร ซึ่งอาศัยแนวร่วมภายในชุมชนอินเตอร์เน็ตที่มีความสนใจเหมือนกันเพื่อทำให้เกิดการนำไปใช้งาน วิธีการนี้ได้ผลดีในระยะเริ่มต้นของอินเตอร์เน็ต แต่อย่างไรก็ตาม ตั้งแต่ช่วงต้นทศวรรษที่ 1990 เป็นต้นมา มีโพรโตคอลใหม่ๆ จำนวนน้อยมากที่ได้รับการยอมรับและนำไปใช้อย่างแพร่หลาย [เครือข่ายคริปโตเข้ามาแก้ปัญหา](https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef)นี้โดยมอบแรงจูงใจทางเศรษฐศาสตร์ให้แก่นักพัฒนา ผู้ดูแล และผู้มีส่วนร่วมในเครือข่ายคนอื่นๆ ในรูปแบบของโทเคน พวกมันแข็งแกร่งในเชิงเทคนิคกว่ามาก ยกตัวอย่างเช่น พวกมันสามารถรักษาสเตท และทำการเปลี่ยนแปลงสเตทตามที่จต้องการ ซึ่งเป็นสิ่งที่โพรโตคอลในอดีตไม่สามารถทำได้\n\nเครือข่ายคริปโตใช้กลไกหลายอย่างเพื่อสร้างความมั่นใจว่าพวกมันจะสามารถรักษาความเป็นกลางไว้ได้ในระหว่างที่มันเริ่มเติบโต และป้องกันไม่ให้เกิดอาการเบตแอนด์สวิตช์อย่างแพลตฟอร์มแบบรวมศูนย์ ลำดับแรก สัญญาระหว่างเครือข่ายคริปโตและผู้มีส่วนร่วมถูกบังคับใช้ผ่านโค้ดแบบโอเพนซอร์ซ ลำดับที่สอง พวกมันถูกควบคุมไว้โดยกลไกสำหรับการ “ส่งเสียง” และ “การเดินออก” ([voice and exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty)) ผู้มีส่วนร่วมมีสิทธิ์มีเสียงผ่านการปกครองโดยชุมชน ทั้งในรูปแบบ “บนเชน” (on chain) (ผ่านตัวโพรโตคอลเอง) และ “นอกเชน” (off chain) (ผ่านโครงสร้างทางสังคมที่รายล้อมตัวโพรโตคอล) ผู้มีส่วนร่วมสามารถเดินออกได้โดยเลิกใช้เครือข่ายและขายเหรียญของตัวเอง หรือในกรณีสุดโต่ง ก็สามารถฟอร์ค (fork) โพรโตคอลได้เช่นกัน\n\nสรุปโดยสังเขปก็คือ เครือข่ายคริปโตสามารถจัดวางให้ผู้มีส่วนร่วมในเครือข่ายสามารถทำงานร่วมกันเพื่อเป้าหมายเดียวกันได้ เพื่อการเติบโตของเครือข่ายและการแข็งค่าของโทเคน การหาแนวร่วมเช่นนี้ยังเป็นหนึ่งในเหตุผลหลักที่บิตคอยน์ยังสามารถแข็งข้อต่อบรรดาผู้กังขา และพัฒนาเจริญรุ่งเรืองต่อไปได้ แม้ว่าเครือข่ายใหม่ๆ อย่างอีเธอเรียมจะเติบโตเคียงข้างมัน\n\nในปัจจุบัน เครือข่ายคริปโตกำลังตรากตรำกับข้อจำกัดที่เหนี่ยวรั้งไม่ให้พวกมันท้าทายกลุ่มรวมศูนย์ผู้ครองบัลลังก์ได้อย่างจริงจังเท่าที่ควร ข้อจำกัดที่สาหัสที่สุดเห็นจะเป็นเรื่องประสิทธิภาพและศักยภาพในการรองรับการขยายตัว (scalability) ช่วงเวลาในปีต่อๆ ไปนี้ จะถูกใช้ไปกับการแก้ไขปัญหาเหล่านี้ และสร้างเครือข่ายที่ทำให้เกิดชั้นโครงสร้างพื้นฐานของชุดเทคโนโลยีสำหรับการพัฒนาคริปโต (crypto stack) และหลังจากนั้นพลังงานส่วนใหญ่ก็จะถูกหมุนไปสร้างแอปพลิเคชันบนโครงสร้างพื้นฐานเหล่านั้น\n\n### สิ่งที่จะทำให้กระจายศูนย์ชนะ\n\nมันเป็นเรื่องหนึ่งที่จะกล่าวว่าเครือข่ายการกระจายศูนย์ควรจะชนะ และเป็นอีกเรื่องหนึ่งที่จะกล่าวว่าพวกมันจะชนะ ลองมาดูเหตุผลพิเศษที่จะทำให้เรามีความหวังในเรื่องนี้\n\nซอฟต์แวร์และการบริการบนเว็บถูกสร้างขึ้นโดยนักพัฒนา มีนักพัฒนาที่เก่งกาจนับล้านบนโลกนี้ โดยมีเพียงแค่เสี้ยวเดียวที่ทำงานอยู่ในบริษัทเทคโนโลยีใหญ่ๆ และเพียงส่วนน้อยมากๆ ของคนในเสี้ยวนั้น ที่กำลังทำงานเกี่ยวกับการพัฒนาผลิตภัณฑ์ มีหลายโปรเจ็กต์ซอฟต์แวร์ที่สำคัญที่สุดในประวัติศาสตร์จำนวนมากที่ถูกสร้างขึ้นโดยสตาร์ตอัพ หรือชุมชนของนักพัฒนาอิสระ\n\n***“ไม่ว่าคุณจะเป็นใคร คนฉลาดที่สุดส่วนใหญ่ทำงานให้ผู้อื่น”***\n\n\n***\n\nเครือข่ายกระจายศูนย์จะสามารถคว้าบัลลังก์ในยุคที่สามของอินเตอร์เน็ตได้ ก็ด้วยเหตุผลประการเดียวกันกับที่ทำให้มันเป็นผู้ชนะในยุคแรก นั่นคือการชนะทั้งสมองและหัวใจของผู้ประกอบการและนักพัฒนา\n\nการเปรียบเเทียบที่ทำให้เห็นภาพได้อย่างชัดเจนคือ การชิงชัยของคู่ปรับในช่วงทศวรรษที่ 2000 ระหว่างวิกิพีเดียและคู่แข่งรวมศูนย์อย่างเอนคาร์ตา หากคุณนำผลิตภัณฑ์ทั้งสองมาเปรียบเทียบกันในช่วงต้นทศวรรษที่ 2000 เอนคาร์ตาถือว่าเป็นผลิตภัณฑ์ที่ดีกว่าอยู่หลายช่วงตัว เนื่องด้วยเนื้อหาครอบคลุมหัวข้อที่หลากหลายมากกว่า และแม่นยำมากกว่า แต่กระนั้น วิกิพีเดียกลับพัฒนาด้วยอัตราที่เร็วกว่ามาก เพราะมันมีชุมชนของเหล่าผู้เข้ามาช่วยงานแสนกระตือรือร้น ผู้ซึ่งดึงดูดต่อสปิริตของชุมชนอย่างการกระจายศูนย์และการปกครองโดยชุมชน ต่อมาในปี 2005 วิกิพีเดียได้กลายเป็นเว็บไซต์อ้างอิงที่ได้รับ[ความนิยม](https://medium.com/@cdixon/it-s-hard-to-believe-today-but-10-years-ago-wikipedia-was-widely-considered-a-doomed-experiment-a7a0dfd27b8b)มากที่สุดบนอินเตอร์เน็ต ส่วนเอนคาร์ตาปิดตัวลงในปี 2009\n\nบทเรียนของเรื่องนี้ก็คือ เมื่อใดที่คุณจะนำระบบรวมศูนย์มาเปรียบเทียบกับระบบกระจายศูนย์ คุณต้องพิจารณาพวกมันในฐานะกระบวนการที่มีพลวัตอยู่ตลอด แทนที่จะคิดถึงมันในฐานะผลิตภัณฑ์ที่แข็งทื่อไร้การเปลี่ยนแปลง ระบบรวมศูนย์มักจะออกตัวด้วยระบบที่เสร็จสิ้นสมบูรณ์ แต่มันจะพัฒนาได้แค่ตามอัตราที่พนักงานในบริษัทซึ่งหนุนหลังมันอยู่จะสามารถพัฒนาได้ ส่วนระบบกระจายศูนย์นั้น ถึงแม้จะออกตัวแบบเสร็จครึ่งๆ กลางๆ แต่หากอยู่ภายใต้สภาวะที่เหมาะสมแล้ว มันจะเติบโตอย่างก้าวกระโดดเมื่อมันสามารถดึงดูดผู้เข้ามาช่วยงานคนใหม่ๆ เข้ามา\n\nในกรณีของเครือข่ายคริปโตนั้น มันมีวงจรการคิดทบทวน (feedback loop) ที่ทบรวมกันมาจากวงจรหลากหลายอย่าง ซึ่งเข้าไปมีเอี่ยวกับกลุ่มนักพัฒนาหลักของโพรโตคอล กลุ่มนักพัฒนาเครือข่ายคริปโตที่เกื้อหนุนกัน กลุ่มนักพัฒนาของแอปพลิเคชันบุคคลที่สาม และผู้ให้บริการต่างๆ ที่เป็นผู้ดำเนินการเครือข่าย วงจรการคิดทบทวนเหล่านี้ยังสามารถแผ่ขยายเพิ่มขึ้นได้ด้วยแรงจูงใจที่เกิดจากโทเคนที่เกี่ยวข้อง อย่างที่เราพบเห็นได้จากบิตคอยน์และอีเธอเรียม มันสามารถเร่งเครื่องได้เต็มสูบตามอัตราที่ชุมชนคริปโตพัฒนาไป (และบางครั้งก็นำไปสู่ผลลัพธ์ในเชิงลบ อย่างการขุดบิตคอยน์ที่กินไฟมหาศาล)\n\nคำถามที่ว่า ระหว่างระบบแบบกระจายศูนย์และระบบแบบรวมศูนย์แล้ว ใครจะเป็นผู้คว้าชัยชนะของอินเตอร์เน็ตในยุคต่อไป สามารถถูกย่อยลงมากลายเป็นคำถามว่า ใครกันแน่ที่สามารถสร้างผลิตภัณฑ์ที่ตราตรึงใจที่สุด และสามารถถูกย่อยลงได้อีกเป็นคำถามว่า ใครที่จะได้นักพัฒนาและผู้ประกอบการชั้นเยี่ยมมาอยู่ฝั่งตนมากว่ากัน กลุ่ม GAFA มีข้อได้เปรียบหลายอย่าง ตั้งแต่เงินสดสำรอง ฐานผู้ใช้งานขนาดมหึมา และโครงสร้างพื้นฐานที่ทำงานได้ดี ส่วนเครือข่ายคริปโตมีคุณค่าที่ส่งมอบให้ลูกค้า (value proposition) ที่จับใจนักพัฒนาและผู้ประกอบการนำหน้าไปหลายขุม ถ้าพวกเขาสามารถชนะทั้งความคิดและจิตใจได้ล่ะก็ พวกเขาจะสามารถระดมทรัพยากรได้มากกว่ากลุ่ม GAFA อย่างมหาศาล และสามารถแซงหน้าการพัฒนาผลิตภัณฑ์ไปอย่างไม่เห็นฝุ่น\n\n***“ถ้าคุณถามผู้คนในปี 1989 ว่าพวกเขาต้องการอะไรที่จะให้ชีวิตของพวกเขาดีขึ้น มันคงจะเป็นไปได้ยากที่พวกเขาจะตอบว่า เครือข่ายโหนดข้อมูลแบบกระจายศูนย์ที่เชื่อมโยงกันผ่านการใช้ไฮเปอร์เท็กซ์ (hypertext)”***\n\n\n***\n\nแพลตฟอร์มรวมศูนย์มักจะถูกเปิดตัวในรูปแบบแพ็คเกจรวมแอปสุดพิเศษ อาทิ เฟสบุ้คมีฟีเจอร์หลักนานาชนิดที่ตอบโจทย์การเข้าสังคม ส่วนไอโฟนก็มีแอปหลักๆ หลายแอปติดมากับเครื่อง ในอีกฝั่งหนึ่งที่ต่างออกไป แพลตฟอร์มแบบกระจายศูนย์มักจะถูกปล่อยมาในลักษณะราวกับอาหารที่ยังทำไม่เสร็จ และไม่มีกรณีการใช้งานที่ชัดเจน สิ่งที่ตามมาก็คือ พวกมันจะต้องฝ่าด่านสองเฟสของความสอดคล้องของสินค้าและตลาด (product-market fit) 1) ความสอดคล้องของสินค้าและตลาดระหว่างแพลตฟอร์มและนักพัฒนา/ผู้ประกอบการ ผู้ที่จะทำให้แพลตฟอร์มเสร็จและสร้างระบบนิเวศต่อยอดออกไป และ 2) ความสอดคล้องของสินค้าและตลาดระหว่างแพลตฟอร์ม/ระบบนิเวศ และผู้ใช้ที่อยู่สุดสายของปลายน้ำ กระบวนการสองขยักนี้คือสิ่งที่ให้คนหลายๆ คน รวมไปถึงนักเทคโนโลยีผู้เจนจัด มักจะประเมินศักยภาพของแพลตฟอร์มกระจายศูนย์ต่ำเกินกว่าที่ควรจะเป็นอยู่ร่ำไป\n\n### ยุคต่อไปของอินเตอร์เน็ต\n\nเครือข่ายกระจายศูนย์ไม่ใช่กระสุนเงินแสนวิเศษที่จะมาทะลวงทุกปัญหาซึ่งเกิดขึ้นบนอินเตอร์เน็ต แต่กระนั้น พวกมันก็ยังมอบแนวทางดำเนินการที่ดีกว่าระบบรวมศูนย์เป็นอย่างมาก\n\nมาลองเปรียบเทียบปัญหาสแปมของทวิตเตอร์และปัญหาสแปมของอีเมล

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第九篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并持续推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一次周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n原文：\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n编译：\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n### 第十篇20220721\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】What is a Social Recovery Wallet?\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n钱包的三个关键标准：不被单点击破、学习成本低和\n\n【个人思考】\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://hackernoon.com/what-is-a-social-recovery-wallet](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-a-social-recovery-wallet)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658407333, "digest": "qzYkyl5hOfThiksgmKqW9YeTdpuHMR8fPn6mwGsXW-4", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

Dozens of notable web3-based companies in the last year have created their own NFT (non-fungible token) ticketing platforms in an attempt to shake up the industry. What is so evidently wrong with ticketing as it stands today? There is the ever-present notion that Ticketmaster and other major ticketing companies are failing to curb-stomp the ridiculously overpriced resale market, and are actively contributing to prices getting more absurd. But is that true? Does Ticketmaster have a plan to restore its reputation, and potentially create their own NFT ticketing protocol? Will NFTs become a viable and dominant form of ticketing, or does NFT ticketing represent another use of blockchain just ‘because’. Fair-warning: this is a long article, because the subject is complicated and nuanced. Let’s dive into the state of ticketing in 2022, what is wrong with ticketing, and what the future looks like.\n\nKeep this in your head. What are tickets used for?\n\n* Admission to an event\n* Right to travel (airplanes, bus, train)\n* Virtual queueing (waiting in line at the post office)\n* Pass (a subscription or use for a season)\n* Collecting (based on rarity, theme, country of issue)\n\n### Historical Context\n\nWe’ll look to the past to glean some insights. Sports and tickets go hand-in-hand, but the usage of tickets over millenia only became necessary once a system was needed to effectively handle a lot of people being in a single place at a specific time. Practically speaking, the best ticket is one that can be controlled and not easily reproduced. The first documented archeological evidence of ticket usage dates back to Rome in the first century. Numbered tessera (pottery shards, marble, or limestone cut into small cubes) were originally used to gain entrance into amphitheaters and arenas. In the case of the Colosseum, the archways and staircases were numbered, a Will Call booth was used, and resale markets existed.\n\n![Horse Racing not on Ethereum with much lower gas fees](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-C8TQjoO3HnKAOsR_jiHe.png?height=1598&width=2570)\n\nIn the United States, the first sports that utilized tickets was horse-racing, as early as 1665. As the population grew and modern sports began to emerge, ticketing systems were created to accommodate the growing demand for entertainment. Tickets gradually became more sophisticated, initially utilizing paper and print that would be difficult if not impossible to reproduce using a printing press. Tickets allowing passage aboard steamships in the 1800s often contained the signature of the manager and agent that issued the pass. The invention of the ticket stub is largely correlated with the popularization of theaters and moving pictures, allowing stub holders to use facilities before reentering. UPCs (Universal Product Codes) scanned via barcode were a game-changer in the latter part of the 20th century. The ability to have a unique identifier and quickly scan it made previous iterations of ticket management obsolete. Finally, the advent of modern computing has shifted ticketing to largely an online activity. Almost all tickets purchased for events today are done so through apps like Ticketmaster, or online through various portals. Ticketmaster allows you to find events, purchase tickets, and resell them if necessary. On the surface, it looks like ticketing is nearly perfected. Unique identifiers exist, everything is centralized in a single application, and you can find just about anything from sports to clown wrestling easily and with little effort. If Ticketmaster looks so perfected on the surface, why is this industry so ripe for innovation and change?\n\nWe find ourselves at a clear inflection point with ticketing technology. Every technological advancement seems to be one step forward and two steps back for ease-of-use with the caveats of privacy and security concerns. Is this the case with NFTs? Before we talk about Ticketmaster, let’s talk more broadly about fraud.\n\n### The Black Market\n\nFraud has been an issue with tickets since the dawn of paid events. More fraud means higher prices for infrastructure to support dealing with increasingly sophisticated fraudulent counterfeits, security hacks, and AI-powered ticket-purchasing bots. Premints, blacklisting, and allow-lists are common practices precisely to push for equitability. Consumers have a difficult time distinguishing real tickets from fake ones, especially when previous methods to appear authentic are circumvented and physical attributes are copied in detail. The higher the value, the higher the chance for counterfeit tickets. One of the most notable examples of this was the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. A sleek and professional looking website designed with the name ‘Beijing 2008 Ticketing’ collectively fooled $50 million dollars out of the pockets of fans worldwide. Keep in mind that’s just a single scam. Up to 5 million fake tickets are sold per year worldwide, with some concerts having nearly 1 in 10 people purchasing tickets ending up receiving a fraud.\n\n### What’s Wrong With Ticketmaster?\n\nBefore extrapolating on the specifics, let's bullet out what exactly is wrong with Ticketmaster (and tickets in general, as they have become one in the same):\n\n* Privacy: a monopoly controlling this much data with specific terms is *bad*.\n* Holdbacks: lying to people about how many tickets are at a concert isn’t cool.\n* Restrictions on resale: you have to use our platform, or else.\n* Leveraging other parts of their business: Live Nation is the primary concert promoter.\n\nIt’s pretty much impossible to have a conversation about the future or current state of ticketing without bringing up Ticketmaster. The amount of things the company has done to create as much of a monopoly as possible over the industry doesn’t just *seem* criminal, it is criminal. For starters, ticket resale is the fastest growing segment of Ticketmaster’s business. They have a financial incentive to not just allow scalping, but to actively partner with scalpers. Because most ticket sales are now digital, Ticketmaster has locked down the resale market by creating one of its own, and no longer works actively with ticket resale marketplaces like Vivid Seats or StubHub. There’s simply more money to be made from resale sales than from primary, and the data supports that.\n\nAnother practice that has induced real hatred in recent years is the practice of holdbacks. Holdbacks are a practice where only a portion of tickets are put on sale for the first day. There have been plenty of instances in recent years of Ticketmaster holding back as much as 50% of the actual tickets for an event on the initial first day of sale. This is obviously a form of artificial scarcity, which causes normal concert-goers to resort to using the resale market on the application in order to get a ticket. This can cause a ticket that might normally be $100 to end up costing as much as $600, or even higher (in more extreme cases, think Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift).\n\n![I know what I have to do… but I don’t know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xB_-UCTRYt3nAyP2j1-GM.png?height=326&width=766)\n\nUnfortunately, we are not yet free from the pain of Ticketmaster. Executives have already indicated that there is a considerable amount of internal R&D happening surrounding web3 at Ticketmaster, and they will no doubt pivot if their current monopolistic tendencies sour their reputation to the point where that is necessary. In February of 2022, Ticketmaster partnered with the NFL to offer limited edition NFTs to celebrate Super Bowl LVI. Each fan who attended got a complimentary and customized NFT featuring where they sat, acting as a sort of POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol), but with Ticketmaster’s decidedly unfun corporate twist.\n\nTicketmaster will continue to engage in anticompetitive behavior until it either goes out of business or the sun engulfs the Earth. Which is more likely in our lifetime? One might suggest simply not going to events that have tickets hosted via Ticketmaster, but that also hurts creatives, and it seems unlikely that enough people would boycott the platform to make a tangible difference. Seeing individual venues pivot to using recently created ticketing platforms and utilizing NFTs could make a dent in the market in this decade. As mentioned by John Bergmayer of Public Knowledge, Congress could pass the BOSS Act, which would bring transparency to the marketplace and end some of these practices. Legislation needs to be passed to prevent these behaviors from continuing to proliferate.\n\nBut hey, we’re using the most extreme examples of the modern ticket market. That said, in terms of market share, Ticketmaster has the highest share of sales among competitors at around 66 percent of sales as of June 2021. We could talk about Ticketweb, AXS Tickets, Ticketsocket, or Movietickets, but they’re small fry by comparison. When was the last time you bought a ticket through Ticketsocket, anyways?\n\nLet’s look to the future.\n\n### Benefits of NFT Ticketing\n\nThe gut reasoning to utilizing NFTs given the current market dominance of Ticketmaster is simply that they are not Ticketmaster, but that wouldn’t be quite right. Let’s break down some of the benefits of using NFTs as tickets:\n\n* Traceable ownership\n* Public visibility to how the tickets are programmed\n* Resale price ceilings\n* Royalty splits\n* Built-in rewards (instant loyalty program for fans)\n* Forgery prevention (not easily forged/validated on-chain)\n* Faster and cheaper (Flow blockchain is a great example of this being the case)\n* Perpetual revenue (resales can continue indefinitely as tickets live on as collectables)\n* Immutable - NFT tickets are stored on-chain, not in your pocket\n\nTraceable ownership is major, but also currently possible through mainstream ticketing protocols. You get the idea, the blockchain is immutable and you can clearly track through a scanner who owned what, when, and what they paid for it. It’s public information. Most blockchains work this way. Smart contracts and tokens as ‘programmable money’ is really at the root of these ideas; think of NFTs as distinctly unique and non-fungible versions of fungible currencies.\n\nBecause of smart contract protocols, public visibility into how the tickets are programmed means external audits can happen and people can confirm for themselves how everything actually ‘works’. The same is true for being transparent when it comes to resale price ceilings and royalty splits. If an artist wants to make sure the resale market doesn’t get out of hand, that can be baked into the contract they sign. If an artist wants higher royalties for resale sales of NFTs as collectables, that can be negotiated prior to the event as well. This ties into one of the last bullets concerning perpetual revenue; as long as the tickets are live on a blockchain, you can theoretically make money off of them through royalties. Making tickets more unique, hand-crafted by artists, and truly desired means the floor price after an event will remain higher than it would be otherwise.\n\nBecause NFT collections are so customizable, a single NFT can act as a ticket perpetually, granting a fan or group of people access to regular events, annual shows, you name it. Suppose you’ve got a convention where there’s only room for 5,000 people, so you make 5,000 NFTs. Reselling the ticket on the open market becomes vastly easier with platforms like Opensea (even if there are still issues with decentralization and standardization here). In the case of VeeCon 2022, VeeCon NFT holders got into the event with an NFT and scannable code. The ticket to that event will live on forever, and has already become a collectible in the eyes of some people. As VeeCon’s site mentions ‘By owning a VeeFriends Series 1 token, you get three VeeCon Ticket NFTs airdropped for free, one per year: 2022, 2023, 2024.’ Pretty cool utility, right? You can see the appeal here as opposed to a single week or day event.\n\nBuilt-in rewards seem like an obvious benefit to any NFT diehards. Creating purchasable NFTs can set you up as a creator for having access to a group of people that are interested in what you’re creating or doing, and now you’ve got their wallet #. On-chain analytics and seeing what else your fans are into is a rapidly emerging field that we’re calling ‘Owner Relationship Management’. Think CRM + NFT = ORM. A good example of a platform for web3 that is doing exactly that is Sayl. Remove the middleman and deliver continuous value to customers. I encourage taking a look at their platform here: <https://sayl.finance/>\n\nForgery prevention is another obvious advantage. As I mentioned before, having auditable and traceable transactions publicly is a major plus. You either have the NFT in your wallet, or you don’t. Baked-in cryptography backed by a reliable blockchain means you get what you pay for. There’s no way for me to fake owning a BAYC or CryptoPunk. I can lie to my friends (I tried that, it didn’t work) and say I’ve got one, but even if you make a fake collection it is immediately clear that it isn’t the real deal. Creating applications that can verify instantly if a ticket is coming from a legitimate source is a big deal.\n\nFaster and cheaper is another point I’d like to stress. Although some blockchains can be slower and more expensive (looking at you, ETH) we’ve seen the rapid popularization of faster and cheaper blockchains that are still very reliable. The best implemented example of this that I can think of is Flow. Flow is trusted by the NBA, UFC, Ubisoft, Samsung, and the NFL for implementing a few various projects. It’s PoS (Proof of Stake), meaning it uses vastly less energy than Ethereum, and transaction fees can often be a fraction of a cent (or 0.000001 FLOW). Compare that to Ethereum’s average $20 per transaction and the difference becomes obvious. When you factor in Ticketmaster’s numerous ‘service fees’, the choice becomes even clearer. A PoS-based blockchain for ticketing is right around the corner, and it isn’t going to cost a lot of money to make it work. Flow already supports NFTs, and tying in all previously mentioned benefits is entirely possible. And yes, it is eco-friendly.\n\nLastly, NFT tickets aren’t prone to some of the issues that have marred ticketing platforms in the past. If a blockchain is decentralized, it will be prone to less downtime, or none at all. While looking up your actual seat at a game might prove difficult if you show up to an event without a QR code to scan, I have no doubts that the industry will find innovative ways to make losing your ticket virtually impossible. A decentralized solution to TaaS (Ticketing as a Service) could be exactly what we need. A blockchain focused on delivering utility and value for tickets and events. In many ways this already exists with dozens of viable blockchains that could be this solution. What we want to avoid is the centralization, lying, price gouging, manipulation, and resale market concerns that are rampant with Lord Ticketmaster.\n\n![LeewayHertz made this graph. Take a look at it.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C-snU3Tfmyjw20nhHzYey.png?height=1776&width=1036)\n\n### Examples of NFT Ticketing\n\nNow that we’ve explained the benefits of NFT ticketing, let's take a look at some of the most notable industry leaders in this nascent space.\n\nWhat you’ll notice about some of these startups is their eagerness to be transparent, and to be everything that Ticketmaster is not. Many of the benefits I’ve already shared above regarding NFT ticketing are present in these projects and solutions. However, some differ in a few ways, and I will highlight those differences below.\n\n### FWB Gatekeeper\n\n[https://fwb.mirror.xyz/XU5_RYsow8fDbbckryr2snNyfrMV8HTJ0N39Cjkfy3s](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/XU5_RYsow8fDbbckryr2snNyfrMV8HTJ0N39Cjkfy3s)\n\nFriends with Benefits (FWB) started as a social DAO with cultural creators, thinkers, and builders. In line with their desire to shape web3 culture, FWB has created FWB Gatekeeper, a tool for IRL token-gating. This tool was first used at ETH’s Euro conference this week. Those familiar with token-gating understand how cool it is to see this utility outside of Discord. As their Mirror mentions ‘Once the ticket holder arrives onsite at the event, \\[the\\] event organizer uses the FWB Gatekeeper mobile app to scan the QR code and verify that the ticket holder is still holding the correct token type and amount. Event organizer then “admits” ticket \\[the\\] holder and their attendance at the event, collecting web3 addresses for follow ups such as proof of attendance, airdrops, and data visualization.’\n\nThis will be a fantastic way for web3-native communities to host events without even having to create tickets. Just using the native token for the community is all that is required for admission. You can imagine this application being built out more, allowing for increased utility and rewards when being used.\n\n![FWB Gatekeeper 1.0](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IMrhnvrf92w3LxSUoYfZ3.png?height=468&width=1494)\n\n### Bam.Fan\n\n[https://www.bam.fan/](https://www.bam.fan/)\n\nBam offers out of the box, end-to-end, white-labeled ticketing and event management systems, or used more simply as an API-driven TaaS model. You can sell tickets directly on your website, and make it look however you want. Great company and solution for brands who want everything to look and feel a particular way.\n\n### Seatlab\n\n[https://www.seatlabnft.com/](https://www.seatlabnft.com/)\n\nSeatlab might be the most notable NFT ticketing company, and has made a point from its inception to be as transparent as possible. Seatlab is built on the Gen-3 NEAR protocol, which utilizes sharding architecture via Nightshade. Essentially, this means NEAR can process 100,000 transactions per second, making gas fees a non-issue. Seatlab’s goal is to completely eliminate fraud, forgery, and counterfeiting. Once you’ve created a seller account, creating events and listing tickets is fairly intuitive and simple. The process for creating and minting tickets looks very similar to some all-in-one solutions for creating NFTs. Sellers are not charged a platform fee, and the $SEAT token acts as the utility token for the platform. The whitepaper is on the website, and spells out the tokenomics and plan for the future of the platform.\\*\\*\n\\*\\*\n\n### Get Protocol\n\n[https://www.get-protocol.io/](https://www.get-protocol.io/)\n\nGet Protocol was one of the first players in this space, and is probably the second biggest name after Seatlab. The one extremely cool thing about Get Protocol is that they are pioneering the field of DeFi-funded events. That’s right, using decentralized financial tools to receive funding for future events without taking on other forms of debt. Liquidity providers can assess the risk and reward of future events and tickets, and revenue can flow back to the provider of the liquidity after the event has taken place. Once again, this is governed through smart contracts. As software solutions like this continue to become more popular, we’re going to see more software developers with legal backgrounds becoming increasingly important.\n\n### The Ticket Fairy\n\n[https://www.ticketfairy.com](https://www.ticketfairy.com)\n\nOn the surface, Ticket Fairy just looks like another alternative Ticketmaster, Stubhub, or AXS. But Ticket Fairy is more innovative, offering reward tiers and more analytics when it comes to referred sales, revenue, and clicks. But what is most exciting about Ticket Fairy is the support for web3 wallets. Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana are supported, and it is possible to verify NFT ownership in real-time with a crypto wallet. This opens the door for token-gated and community-based incentives and rewards. Below is how the portal looks on an event with Steve Aoki.\n\n![Notice the separate options for Avatar & Crystal Holder RSVPs via Metamask token-gating.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S5LNEJSveCZbs7USgBKuZ.png?height=1200&width=498)\n\n### Next-Gen Applications (Alt-Tickets)\n\nThe following are two protocols (one in use, another proposed) that will have ticket-like usage in the near future. In the case of POAPs, they are very popular and could be used in the future for ticketing. For SBTs, they are theoretical, but could be used for IRL token-gating. We’ll briefly highlight each and you can decide if how they work is worth digging into more.\n\n### Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAPs)\n\nPOAPs are a new way to prove you’ve attended an event, either virtual or physical. They often store or commemorate memories, and are given out at the beginning or end of events. Because there’s still the potential for fraud, all POAPs are minted through the official POAP smart contract and run on the Ethereum sidechain Gnosis Chain. This gives them the added benefit of being minted nearly for free, and usually distributed with the distributor eating the cost. Because Gnosis is compatible with Ethereum, you can convert POAPs to Ethereum’s mainnet if desired.\n\nPOAPs can be used to reward behavior, and are often referred to as a blockchain resume of sorts. You can imagine an associated POAP being issued after college graduation, or certification of completion of a course. Some DAOs vet their members by checking out their POAPs; after all, you can’t fake it. We’re seeing this pave the way for on-chain, vetted resumes. They’re also a great way to manage subscriptions by engaging with users and fans that actually are receptive. POAPs represent a form of ticketing, but are an entirely new way to engage as well. I encourage anyone interested to check out <https://poap.xyz/>.\n\n### SoulBound Tokens (SBTs)\n\nProposed in 2022 by Economist Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, SBTs can be considered a primitive building block of web3, particularly in a trend known as Decentralized Society (DeSoc). DeSoc is based around principles of composability, bottom-up community, and emergent networks owned and governed by users. SBTs differ from NFTs in that they cannot be transferred.\n\nSBTs could come to represent credentials, affiliations, or commitments made on web3 networks, and exist as tokenized representations of achievements, traits, and features that make up a person or a collective. Although the mechanics are still being outlined, the idea would be that Souls could issue and attest SBTs to other souls. The best example might be the completion of a course or degree, where the Souls issuing the SBTs would need a percentage vote to issue an SBT to another soul. It is clear the mechanics of this would play nicely with current DAO structures. Provable and accurate medical records are still important and subject to potential manipulation in 2022, and are a great example of a type of record that would benefit from a protocol like SBTs. Vitalik’s initial thoughts can be found on his blog here: <https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html>.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nClearly we’re in an interesting stage of the evolutionary development of tickets. While Ticketmaster on the surface has solved a lot of the headache surrounding purchasing and using tickets, most of us can agree that it is very much a love/hate relationship. What new NFT ticketing companies bring to the table is a bold and fresh approach to something that is otherwise overlooked or too boring to think about in detail. But the devil is in the details. A fairer, more equitable world can be made more fair by using ticketing companies that aren’t inherently anti-competitive, and embracing change (even if it isn’t perfect yet). The industry leader for NFT ticketing is yet to be determined. Plenty of all-in-one NFT tools are scrambling to incorporate IRL NFT ticketing into their solutions, and we’ve highlighted a few above. Ticketmaster may indeed pivot to making all of their tickets NFTs, and that is a very real concern. The utility, security, and benefits from using NFTs as tickets is hard to ignore, and usable platforms are already here. Traditional brands hoping to embrace web3 in a safer and more tangible way could benefit from incorporating their usage. One thing is for certain: NFT ticketing is here to stay, and it works.\n\nReferences and more:\n<https://decrypt.co/105000/nfl-expands-ticket-stub-nfts-to-over-100-games-for-2022-season>\n<https://fwb.mirror.xyz/XU5_RYsow8fDbbckryr2snNyfrMV8HTJ0N39Cjkfy3s>\n<https://www.get-protocol.io/>\n<https://www.ticketfairy.com/event/LVCIDIAxAOKIVERSE/>\n<https://www.leewayhertz.com/how-nft-ticketing-works/>\n<https://www.binance.com/en/blog/nft/what-is-nft-ticketing-and-how-does-it-work-421499824684904022>\n<https://www.seatlabnft.com/>\n<https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-powered-startup-aims-to-revolutionize-events-and-ticketing-industry>\n<https://www.bam.fan/>\n<https://publicknowledge.org/more-needs-to-be-done-to-reign-in-the-ticketmaster-monopoly/>\n<https://fitpublishing.com/sites/default/files/ticketoperationschapter_1excerpt.pdf>\n<https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-soulbound-tokens-building-blocks-for-a-web3-decentralized-society>\n<https://business.ticketmaster.com/business-solutions/nfl-partners-with-ticketmaster-to-offer-limited-edition-nfts-to-celebrate-super-bowl-lvi/>\n\nNeed help with your web3 go-to-market strategy?

{"id": "EHK5EYcpoPiuHXBUWQktJs_Hb15L2Ixhfnr9LQl-wm4", "title": "Hanlon's Razor", "body": "Hanlon’s razor is a heuristic which states “never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by moderately rational individuals following incentives in a complex system of interactions”. It attempts to eliminate unlikely explanations for human behaviour. It may be considered to be Occam’s razor, applied to social relations.\n\n**What is a heuristic?**\n\nA heuristic is a mental shortcut that enables us to make faster judgements in situations that are ill-defined, vague or complex. Although efficient, heuristics can be either helpful or damaging depending on the context.\n\n**What is a “razor”?**\n\nA philosophical razor is a type of heuristic. They aim to enable us to create and provide better explanations by discounting complex or unlikely explanations. \n\nThe most popular philosophical ‘razor’ is Occam’s razor. It states that “entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity”. In other words, when deliberating on alternate hypotheses, choose the one with the fewest necessary assumptions.\n\n\n---\n\n**Why use Hanlon’s razor?**\n\nHuman’s in particular are prone to cognitive biases, examples could be the spotlight effect (the tendency for individuals to assume that more attention is focused on them), or the affect heuristic (our tendency to come to conclusions and take action based on how we feel rather than rational analysis). Acknowledging information asymmetry and that others may not be as self-aware or knowledgeable can be beneficial to us all.\n\nAs noted above, people are exposed to such things as the spotlight effect and affect heuristic. We also have a habit of attributing intentionality to the actions of others. This means that we may misconstrue the motives of others, often negatively. The reason for this bias is due to negative consequences having a greater perceived or real effect than positive ones.\n\nHanlon’s razor works best combined and contrasted with other mental models such as:\n\n* The availability heuristic. This mental model suggests that we misjudge the frequency of events. In particular those events that are vivid, emotional and memorable. Many have the tendency to keep and maintain an “internal” scorecard of other’s mistakes\n* Confirmation bias. The tendency to look for information that confirms a pre-existing belief. When cognitive dissonance arises, we tend to aim to realign our worldviews\n* Bias from dislike or hate. When we dislike someone or something, we are more likely to attribute their actions to malice\n* The attributing of our own faults, flaws and failures on to someone or something else. This cheap psychological mechanism is called projection. It serves nothing more other than to maintain a possible self-image\n\n\n---\n\n**Limitations to Hanlon’s razor**\n\nThough a useful heuristic, it is not guaranteed to correctly identify the motives of others and should be applied with caution. There are most certainly those that act out of malice and bad intentions. When applying Hanlon’s razor, consider the following:\n\n* How likely is that action to have occurred for reasons other than malice/bad intentions - the more likely it is, the more probable it did *not* occur due to malice. Consider the past actions of an individual or group and outcomes of those actions\n* What are the costs associated with *incorrectly* assuming malice/bad intentions - It may be more costly to incorrectly assume an individual has acted out of malice than not\n* What are the costs associated with *incorrectly* assuming non-malicious intentions - Is it more costly to assume that an individual acted non-maliciously when in fact they did act out of malice/bad intentions\n\nIn some situations it may be wise to choose not to assume non-malicious intentions because the likelihood of that person acting maliciously is high, or that the cost is too great to assume otherwise. In such situations it may be beneficial to assume malice or bad intentions first, until an acceptable alternative explanation or evidence is provided. This is a “guilty until proven innocent” approach, the “inverse” of Hanlon’s razor, which is “innocent until proven guilty”. \n\nRemember:\n\n* The rule is not always true\n* The rule goes wrong occasionally\n* The rule is *NOT* asking you to be naive\n\n\n---\n\n**Suggested uses of Hanlon’s razor**\n\nHanlon’s razor can be widely applied to life and it’s many facets, some examples could include:\n\n* Media. The modern media treats community outrage and emotional reactions as a commodity to profit from. This takes form in their content which seeks to attribute emotional content such as malice to that which may be explained through competence or ignorance. They are becoming more skilled at generating such assumptions. When looking at newspapers, websites, and social media, the application of Hanlon’s razor can be beneficial\n* Relationships. It is common for damage to occur in relationships due to misconceptions in intent. Often individuals believe that another is intentionally trying to cause harm or create problems. In most cases this is a result of inability or accidental mistakes. Barriers in communications will contribute to this, semantic or otherwise. Through the use of Hanlon’s razor one might identify unintentional actions and highlight the need for help, or maturation. This allows one not to react emotionally and regain, or maintain composure and clarity of thought and reason\n\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* In most cases, it is better to assume that a negative event has occurred due to stupidity or incompetence rather than malice\n* The effective use of mental models such as Hanlon’s razor advocates for a fact-based decision-making response to internal or external negative events\n* The use of Hanlon’s razor may lead to better relationships and smarter problem-solving with more efficient resource allocation", "timestamp": 1658407979, "digest": "fs_ih2Sf--tGbHzkbPF-4frzZ5knZ2mwCwDgnnCtHVU", "contributor": "0xC4183Eb94164c5E7A3a5d5bcF70fCd6e7aDC5f75"}

微信公众号/传播体操***\n\n在小说《阿特拉斯耸耸肩》中，作者安·兰德构建了一个与世隔绝的“现代乌托邦”，这个世外桃源由自私而精明的商人、科学家、艺术家等精英组成。在书中，“金钱至上”理念并没有导致乌托邦世界的道德堕落，反而让它有着田园诗般的诗意，和现实社会中的欲望的满足。\n\n安·兰德后来被认为是“客观主义”哲学流派创立者，甚至被誉为“美国精神的代言人”。有趣的是，安·兰德所虚构的乌托邦世界，与当下Web3簇拥者的终极追求似乎同脉相连，去中心化、私有产权、DAO、NFT……我们似乎都能在安·兰德的乌托邦中找到相似的对应物。\n\n柏拉图式的“乌托邦”与奥威尔式的“反乌托邦”潮流在人类历史长河中此消彼长，而今天他们的焦点似乎停留在了Web3和元宇宙中。因此，我们不妨以此开场，探讨Web3、元宇宙对商业世界，以及对品牌营销可能的影响。\n\n## 1、企业跟Web3有什么关系？\n\n似乎人人都在谈论元宇宙与Web3，但并没有谁能够把这些概念说清楚，即使在从业者群体中，其实也不存在统一标准，甚至大家对“Web3”这个词都存在争议。\n\n早在1998年，“万维网之父”蒂姆·伯纳斯·李就第一次提出了Web3概念，但如今我们所讨论的Web3，显然需要基于区块链技术和元宇宙（全真互联网）背景下理解。按照2021年12月8日美国国会加密货币产业听证会上的通用解释，Web1.0是“只读”互联网，Web2.0是“读+写”的互联网，Web3.0则是“读+写+拥有”的互联网。\n\n这种定义依旧充满争议，并且可能让人一头雾水，但重点却是清晰的——Web3能够帮助用户实现确权，而确权的基础就在于区块链技术，确权的应用场景主要指向了资产，尤其是数字资产。\n\n区块链技术通过一套复杂而精巧的架构，通过算力的分布，实现了信息的难以篡改。也就是说，越是全球各地成员参与到区块链计算和共识之中，算力便越加去中心化，越难有人控制一半以上算力篡改整个区块链信息，保障链上信息的安全和公信力。我们几乎可以说，主流公链上的信息是不可篡改的。\n\n值得注意的是，不可篡改的信息不仅能够实现确权，还能够保障某种“数字资产”的稀缺性，而这在过去任何资产类别中都无法做到。\n\n例如黄金理论上可以通过工业合成（只是成本非常高，并不划算），也可以通过太空采矿的方式去获取（同样是成本问题），但如果在链上写入具体的数量代码，那么这些数字资产的数量在数学逻辑上就已经被锁定、无法更改。这种天然的通缩性质，让区块链数字资产（如NFT）可以被人为赋予基于人群共识的稀缺价值，当然也同样引发了不少炒作热潮。\n\n数字资产的确权，意味着品牌能够借助资产（如NFT）直接指向用户的数字钱包，实现品牌与用户的直连，实现真正意义上的“DTC”（Direct to Consumer）。举例而言，从法律条款上讲，今天品牌公众号的粉丝用户并不属于品牌本身，而是属于微信平台，如果由于一些原因品牌的公众号被封禁关闭，品牌方其实也无力回天，真正的主导权依旧在于平台，但公链下的NFT可以帮助品牌绕过平台，直连消费者的数字钱包。\n\n当然，NFT这类数字资产在营销执行层面也能延展出诸多不同的具体玩法，例如成为品牌的会员运营工具、与实物产品联动等，笔者曾在*《品牌误读了NFT营销？》*一文中有更具体的阐述。\n\n## 2、Web3.0的商业范式转移\n\n如果觉得Web1.0“只读”、Web2.0“读+写”、Web3.0“读+写+拥有”的概念解释过于抽象，我们不妨从企业的商业发展模式出发来理解，因为每一个时代阶段，都会对应着不同的商业范式，而Web3可能带来的商业范式迁移，其实也是令当下Web3从业者最为兴奋的地方之一。\n\nWeb1时代实际上是互联网早期阶段，此时互联网对商业的影响力较弱，企业的商业模式依旧以线下扩张为主。\n\n我们可以说这个阶段的企业经营，遵循的是一种“渠道经济学”，需要不断通过线下门店、渠道的开拓，来实现产品销售半径的扩张，从而实现企业发展壮大。在这种“渠道经济学”的商业范式之下，企业的主要课题往往就在于前端的经销商管理，以及后端的供应链管理、商品周转管理、现金流管理等板块。\n\n也正是因此，Web1时代的企业成长往往需要依靠原始积累的不断“滚雪球”，有稳健且持续盈利的长青特性。而市场对这类企业的评估，往往也使用现金流贴现等框架，对于上市公司，使用PE等指标进行估值。\n\nWeb2时代则是PC互联网和移动互联网成为大众重要信息渠道的时代，同时供应链、物流等基建日趋完善，人们开始“数字化生存”，互联网与传统行业开始相互渗透，企业的商业模式以线上为基点，向线下辐射渗透。\n\n我们可以说在这个阶段的企业经营，遵循的是一种“流量经济学”，流量、用户的注意力成为商业发展的关键，线上电商渠道成为新品牌低成本冷启动的绝佳切入口。在这种“流量经济学”的商业范式之下，商业模型成为漏斗状，企业、品牌的所有营销运营动作，都需要带来流量，否则无法实现最终的转化，企业经营的主要课题，往往就集中在线上流量获取、流量转化，以及线上流量如何反哺线下渠道上。\n\n因此可以看到，品牌的主要经营阵地已经从传统的线下街区/社区，转移到了“双微一抖”等线上平台。新消费品牌浪潮的出现，实际上便是“流量经济学”的一种结果，新消费品牌通过线上流量的铺盖、种草等营销方式的运用，实现了快速的扩张，甚至威胁到传统消费品牌的生存空间。当然，新消费品牌在后续发展中也面临了自身的问题，但那也是后话了。\n\n“流量经济学”的出现，实际上是资本对企业价值评估体系的转移——从“利润”转移到“流量”。这在互联网平台公司中表现得最为明显，广告、电商、游戏三大互联网变现模式，本质上都是流量变现，从BAT到TMD的成长过程中，都可以允许用牺牲短期利润来获取流量，从而实现长期利润。\n\n我们也可以看到，不少新消费品牌的估值，更加趋向于互联网平台公司的评估标准，在一定程度上也容忍企业用亏损换市场，而在传统的PE框架下，亏损企业无法进行估值计算；具有Web2属性企业的成长路径，几乎也是通过“BP-融资-再融资-上市”模式来实现。\n\nWeb3或将迎来新的商业范式的颠覆，但在当下这个时点来看，我们并不知道那会是什么。如果大胆做出预测，笔者认为那将是一种“产权经济学”，基于用户确权的商业经营模式。\n\n从企业发展来看，Web3企业的成长路径或许将是先通过谋求品牌价值共识，然后通过社区的搭建和运营形成种子用户、共创共建，然后通过产品的发布来实现价值和生态扩张。\n\n产权的清晰能够极大地解放生产力，提高商业世界运作效率，正如现代产权理论的奠基人、诺贝尔奖得主科斯所言“没有产权的社会是一个效率绝对低下、资源配置绝对无效的社会,清晰产权才能够保证经济高效率运转。”\n\n在Web2“流量经济学”的框架中，其中一大弊病在于，企业通常将用户视为“流量”、“曝光”，而非“个体”，而在用户看来，品牌与自身的关系并不密切，将企业、品牌视为“服务”、“工具”，种种的价值冲突，催生了“天下苦流量久矣”的情绪。\n\n一个合乎逻辑的预判是，Web3企业能够通过发行NFT等方式，让“用户”与“企业”实现产权上的利益统一，从而进一步激发用户本身的认同感和行动、传播能量。\n\n同时，一个美好的期待是，在Web3的商业逻辑之中，流量开始变得没那么重要了，企业的估值也不再参考流量价值体系，而是更加看重用户社区（NFT社区）的相关指标，“去流量化”也或许能够让商业进一步回归本质。\n\n## 3、品牌共识资产化\n\n在*《品牌误读了NFT营销？》*一文中笔者曾指出，国内外的NFT生态并不相同：国内NFT大多基于联盟链，操作上重合规、去金融化，无法二次交易，NFT被称为“数字藏品”；而海外NFT基于公链，金融属性强，能够二次交易。这些不同点，可能让国内外NFT发展走向存在较大不同。\n\n需要提示的是，我们下面讨论的部分内容仅针对海外市场，但在文章最后我们会再回来讨论国内市场。\n\n在海外NFT生态的语境下，品牌NFT的出现，实际上推动了“品牌共识资产的证券化”，如果从金融角度来看，品牌推出NFT，实际上也可以看做是一种变相的融资途径，而用户通过NFT交易，也能够用更加灵活的方式进行投资和退出。\n\n也就是说，NFT等数字资产的出现，将一个企业转化为“独立经济体”，与外界资本市场产生金融联系。用户对NFT的确权，似乎类似于一种“股权”属性。\n\n由于NFT具有金融资产属性，“万物皆可NFT”的潜台词其实就是万物皆可“to earn”（赚钱），那么不受管制的NFT自然会引发强烈的市场投机行为，这也导致大量Web3项目最终被验证为庞氏骗局。\n\n庞氏骗局的主要特征就在于“pay to earn”，先入局者的收益需要通过后入局者支付，再加上整个生态没有形成正外部性（或正外部性不足以抵消运营成本），最终新入局者的加入会不可持续，导致整体的崩盘。\n\n大量所谓的NFT数字藏品的价值基础是“用户共识”，从整个社会贡献的角度来看，实际上并没有显著的正向价值，这也导致NFT项目屡次出现庞氏骗局暴雷。\n\n即使是能够带来正向社会价值的项目，也容易被投机者的涌入而快速透支和崩溃，例如前段时间引起不少讨论的StepN，一个“run to earn”项目，或许其项目初衷确实是推动更多人热爱跑步、热爱健康，具有正向社会价值，但一旦大量投机者进入，项目方无法把控局面、无法维持“币价”稳定，最终被质疑为庞氏骗局。\n\n可以说，如今的“庞氏骗局”如同“设计永动机”一般，可以被构建的异常复杂且难以看清，这也就让大量用户稍不留神就陷入其中，成为“韭菜”。\n\n但相比于纯数字化的NFT项目，品牌随着企业的成长、产品的销售，服务越来越多的用户，让越来越多用户的生活变得更加美好，其中具有显著的正向社会效应。也就是说，企业的成长、壮大，是一个正和游戏，因此品牌发布NFT所形成的交易博弈，整体是一个正和博弈——各方都有可能受益，没有输家。\n\n企业成长发展的正外部性，便是品牌NFT模式能够持续运转的逻辑基础。因此，笔者认为随着时间的推进，相比于如今各类艺术家IP发售NFT，具有实物产品的企业/品牌更适合成为发布NFT的主角。\n\n## 4、破解“不可能三角”\n\n如果考虑Web3“代币”所带来的交易属性，Web3项目实际上成为了一个金融体，通过NFT、DAO（去中心化自治组织）、DeFi（去中心化金融）等一系列去中心化的创新构建起来。正因为其金融体的特征，笔者认为，在Web3项目的发展和与外界的交互的过程中，同样会遇到传统国际金融中的“不可能三角”（impossible trinity）问题。\n\n“不可能三角”由“欧元之父“、诺贝尔经济学奖得主蒙代尔提出，大意为在开放经济条件下，经济社会和财政金融政策目标选择之间存在冲突，在金融政策方面，资本自由流动、固定汇率和货币政策独立性三者不可能兼得。\n\n如果用Web3项目来类比经济体，那么在“不可能三角“中，“资本的自由流动”可以对应“代币的二级市场交易通畅”，“固定汇率”可以对应“代币的价格稳定”，“货币政策独立性”可以对应“无法篡改的代币发行上链信息”。\n\n也就是说，Web3项目无法同时实现二级市场通畅交易、代币价格稳定和去中心化的信任机制。\n\n笔者认为，“代币”价格的稳定，是Web3项目早期阶段平稳有序发展的一大关键，因为如果“代币”价格剧烈波动，会吸引大量金融投机者的参与，从而将项目推向投机工具，最终崩盘。因此，在海外二级市场被允许的前提之下，Web3项目若要有序发展，必须采用一种中心化的模式。\n\n正是因此，海外大多数所谓的“Web3”项目（如OpenSea），实际上依旧没有完全做到去中心化，这类项目大多在Web2与Web3之间，有业内人士认为它们充其量是Web2.5。\n\n最后我们反观国内的Web3行业，如果用乐观主义的视角来看，国内监管政策导致NFT二级市场交易受限，反而在“不可能三角”中能够推动“NFT价格稳定”和“（基于联盟链的）去中心化的公信力”二者同时实现。\n\n也就是说，杜绝二级市场交易的监管，反而能够保障Web3项目的前期成长，抵挡金融投机者对项目成长的干扰，除了大众资产安全和金融合规的考量之外，也可以视为一种“幼稚产业保护”的策略。因此我们也有理由相信，中国市场有可能会是Web3项目成长更重要和更优质的土壤。\n\n当然，从纯理论上看，Web3的发展依旧需要NFT等代币的自由流通，未来国内NFT等代币能否在二级市场交易，依旧需要看相关监管政策是否变化。在这里笔者不妨大胆预测，等到国内Web3产业基础构建完善并具有一定成熟度时、大众对web3拥有足够认知后，相关代币的二级市场交易也或将逐步有序地放开，国内市场也将成为Web3世界极为重要的组成部分。\n\n## 结语\n\n不少业内人士谈论起Web3，都不约而同地想起了千禧年前后的互联网泡沫。是的，当时互联网还是个新玩意儿，互联网概念一飞冲天然后迅速破灭。现在来看，当年我们对互联网的预测大多并不靠谱，但无法否认的是，互联网确实真真切切地改变了每个人的生活方式。\n\n因此有人认为，如今Web3还处于一个极早期的阶段，我们现在对Web3的所有预测都是错误的，就像当年我们对互联网发展的种种预测同样错误，但无法改变的是，Web3的世界正在到来。",

เป็นคำที่ถูกใช้บ่อยที่สุดคำหนึ่งในพื้นที่ของเศรษฐศาสตร์คริปโต (cryptoeconomics) และมักจะถูกมองว่าเป็นเหตุผลของการมีอยู่ของบล็อกเชนอย่างแท้จริง แต่กระนั้น มันก็เป็นคำที่ถูกนิยามไว้ได้แย่มากที่สุดคำหนึ่งเช่นกัน งานวิจัยกว่าหลายพันชั่วโมง และพลังการประมวลผลแฮช (hashpower) มูลค่ากว่าหลายพันล้านเหรียญฯ ถูกลงไปกับจุดประสงค์หนึ่งเดียวของการทำให้เกิดการกระจายศูนย์ อีกทั้งยังต้องบำรุงรักษา และพัฒนาให้ดียิ่งขึ้นไป และเมื่อใดที่การถกเถียงเริ่มดุเดือด มันเป็นเรื่องแสนจะปกติที่ฝ่ายเสนอของโพรโทคอลนั้นๆ (หรือส่วนขยายของโพรโทคอล) จะอ้างว่าข้อเสนอของเหล่าฝ่ายค้านทั้งหลายต่าง “รวมศูนย์” (centralized) ซึ่งถือว่าเป็นข้อโต้แย้งไม้ตายที่ล้มคู่แข่งได้อย่างชะงัด\n\nอย่างไรก็ดี มักจะเกิดความสับสนบ่อยๆ ว่าแท้จริงแล้ว คำนี้หมายความว่าอย่างไรกันแน่ ขอยกกรณีตัวอย่าง ลองพิจารณาแผนภาพแสนไร้ประโยชน์แต่พบเห็นได้ทั่วไป อย่างแผนภาพด้านล่างนี้:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1094/1\\*WG5_xDDwHv0lMaVUYLNbVA.png)\n\nรูป.1 (ก) รวมศูนย์ (ข) กระจายศูนย์ (ค) เครือข่ายแบบกระจาย\n\nคราวนี้ ลองมาดูสองคำตอบในกระทู้ “[อะไรคือความแตกต่างระหว่างการกระจายและการกระจายศูนย์](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-distributed-and-decentralized-in-Bitcoin-land)” บน Quora กัน คำตอบแรกหยิบยกแผนภาพด้านบนราวกับเป็นนกแก้วนกขุนทอง ส่วนคำตอบที่สองก็แสดงความเห็นที่แตกต่างไปอย่างสิ้นเชิงว่า “การกระจายหมายถึงว่า ไม่ใช่ทุกธุรกรรมจะถูกประมลผลในแห่งเดียวกัน” แต่ “การกระจายศูนย์หมายถึงว่า ไม่มีผู้ใดผู้หนึ่งที่จะมีอำนาจสามารถควบคุมการประมวลผลได้” ในขณะเดียวกัน คำตอบอันดับหนึ่งในกลุ่มอีเธอเรียมบน Stack ก็ตอบด้วย[แผนภาพที่มีลักษณะคล้ายคลึงกับแผนภาพด้านบน](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/7812/question-on-the-terms-distributed-and-decentralised)มาก แต่ด้วยตำแหน่งของคำว่า “การกระจายศูนย์” และ “การกระจาย” นั้นสลับที่กัน! ชัดเจนแล้วว่า คำชี้แจงมันอยู่ในลำดับ!\n\n### การกระจายศูนย์สามประเภท\n\nเวลาที่ใครพูดถึงการกระจายศูนย์ทางซอฟต์แวร์ จริงๆ แล้ว มันมี*แกนสามแกนที่แยกเป็นเอกเทศกันอยู่* ของการรวมศูนย์/กระจายศูนย์ที่พวกเขาอาจจะกำลังพูดถึงกันอยู่ ถึงแม้ว่าบางครั้งมันอาจเป็นเรื่องยากที่จะเห็นว่าเราสามารถมีแกนหนึ่งโดยปราศจากอีกแกนได้ แต่โดยปกติแล้ว แกนเหล่านี้ค่อนข้างจะเป็นอิสระต่อกัน แกนทั้งสามมีดังนี้\n\n* **การกระจาย(หรือรวม)ศูนย์เชิงสถาปัตยกรรม** - ระบบประกอบขึ้นจากคอมพิวเตอร์ที่จับต้องได้จำนวนกี่เครื่อง? ระบบยังสามารถดำเนินการต่อได้แม้คอมพิวเตอร์เหล่านั้นเกิดเสียหายในคราวเดียวสูงสุดกี่เครื่อง?\n* **การกระจาย(หรือรวม)ศูนย์เชิงการเมือง** - มีคนกี่คนหรือองค์กรกี่กลุ่มที่มีอำนาจในการควบคุมคอมพิวเตอร์ที่ระบบกำลังวิ่งอยู่ทั้งหมดได้อย่างเบ็ดเสร็จ?\n* **การกระจาย(หรือรวม)ศูนย์เชิงตรรกะ** - อินเตอร์เฟสและโครงสร้างข้อมูลที่ระบบนำเสนอและดำเนินการอยู่ ดูแล้วเหมือนเป็นวัตถุที่เป็นมวลก้อนใหญ่ชิ้นเดียว หรือฝูงอสัณฐานไร้รูปร่างตายตัวมากกว่ากัน? วิธีการค้นหาคำตอบด้วยตัวเองแบบง่ายๆ ก็คือ ถ้าคุณผ่าระบบออกเป็นสองส่วน โดยรวมทั้งฝั่งผู้ให้บริการและผู้ใช้งานแล้ว ทั้งสองส่วนจะสามารถทำงานได้ตามปกติในฐานะหน่วยย่อยอิสระได้หรือไม่?\n\nเราสามารถลองนำมิติทั้งสามมาใส่ลงในแผนภาพนี้ได้:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fZ_9kj5JApoP4XzllsO8f.png?height=616&width=1071)\n\nพึงสังเกตว่า หลายข้อในชาร์ตนี้ถูกวางอย่างหยาบๆ และสร้างข้อโต้แย้งได้อีกมาก แต่มาลองดูตามไปทีละอัน:\n\n* บริษัทแบบดั้งเดิมมีการเมืองแบบรวมศูนย์ (ซีอีโอหนึ่งคน) ใช้สถาปัตยกรรมแบบรวมศูนย์ (สำนักงานใหญ่หนึ่งแห่ง) และดำเนินการด้วยตรรกะแบบรวมศูนย์ (ไม่สามารถแบ่งครึ่งบริษัทได้)\n* ระบบประมวลกฎหมายพึ่งพิงคณะร่างกฎหมายแบบรวมศูนย์ ในขณะที่ระบบกฎหมายจารีตประเพณีสร้างขึ้นจากการตัดสินใจที่ผ่านมาของผู้พิพากษาแต่ละคน ระบบประมวลกฎหมายยังพอจะใช้สถาปัตยกรรมแบบกระจายศูนย์ เนื่องจากมีศาลหลายแห่ง ที่ถึงแม้จะให้น้ำหนักกับดุลยพินิจของเจ้าหน้าที่ แต่ระบบกฎหมายจารีตประเพณีก็ยังให้น้ำหนักมากกว่า อย่างไรก็ดี ทั้งสองต่างมีตรรกะที่รวมศูนย์ (“กฎหมายก็คือกฎ”)\n* ภาษามีตรรกะแบบกระจายศูนย์ ภาษาอังกฤษที่อลิซใช้สื่อสารกับบ็อบ ไม่จำเป็นต้องสอดคล้องกับภาษาอังกฤษที่ชาร์ลีใช้สื่อสารกับเดวิดเลย ภาษาไม่ต้องมีโครงสร้างแบบรวมศูนย์เพื่อที่จะให้มันคงอยู่ได้ และกฎไวยากรณ์ภาษาอังกฤษไม่ได้ถูกสร้างหรือถูกกำหนดโดยใครคนใดคนหนึ่ง (แม้ว่าภาษาเอสเปรันโตเดิมทีจะถูกคิดค้นโดยลุดวิก ซาเมนฮอฟ ([Ludwig Zamenhof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._L._Zamenhof)) แต่ปัจจุบันมันก็ทำงานเหมือนกับภาษาที่ใช้กันอยู่ในสมัยนี้มากกว่า ซึ่งค่อยๆ วิวัฒน์โดยปราศจากผู้คุมกฎ)\n* บิตทอร์เรนต์ทำงานแบบกระจายศูนย์ในเชิงตรรกะเช่นเดียวกับภาษาอังกฤษ เครือข่ายการส่งเนื้อหา (content delivery network) ก็คล้ายกัน แต่ว่ามันถูกควบคุมโดยบริษัทใดบริษัทหนึ่ง\n* บล็อกเชนกระจายศูนย์ในเชิงการเมือง (ไม่มีใครควบคุมมันอยู่) และใช้สถาปัตยกรรมแบบกระจายศูนย์ (ไม่มีจุดศูนย์กลางเชิงโครงสร้างที่จะทำให้ล่มได้) แต่ทำงานบนตรรกะแบบรวมศูนย์ (มีเพียงสเตท (state) เดียวที่ผ่านการตกลงร่วมกัน และระบบ*ประพฤติตัว*เสมือนว่าเป็นคอมพิวเตอร์เพียงตัวเดียว)\n\nบ่อยครั้งที่เวลาใครพูดถึงคุณงามความดีของบล็อกเชน พวกเขามักจะเอ่ยถึงประโยชน์ด้านความสะดวกของการมี “ฐานข้อมูลกลางเพียงแห่งเดียว” การรวมศูนย์เช่นนี้ถือเป็นการรวมศูนย์เชิงตรรกะ และการรวมศูนย์ประเภทนี้อาจจะกล่าวได้ในหลายๆ กรณีว่าเป็นเรื่องที่ดี (แต่ฮวน เบเนต์ (Juan Benet) จาก IPFS จะผลักดันให้เกิดการกระจายศูนย์เชิงตรรกะในทุกๆ ที่ที่เป็นไปได้ เพราะระบบที่ใช้ตรรกะแบบกระจายศูนย์มักจะเอาชีวิตรอดจากการแบ่งส่วนเครือข่ายได้อย่างเก่งกาจ และทำงานได้ดีในพื้นที่ที่มีการเชื่อมต่อที่ไม่ค่อยดี เป็นต้น ลองอ่านต่อได้ใน[บทความนี้บน Scuttlebot](http://scuttlebot.io/more/articles/design-challenge-avoid-centralization-and-singletons.html) ที่พูดถึงการสนับสนุนตรรกะแบบกระจายศูนย์อย่างตรงไปตรงมา)\n\nการรวมศูนย์เชิงสถาปัตยกรรมมักจะนำไปสู่การรวมศูนย์เชิงการเมือง แต่ก็ไม่ได้เป็นเช่นนั้นเสมอไป อย่างในประชาธิปไตยแบบทางการ นักการเมืองมาพบกันและลงคะแนนเสียงในพื้นที่สภาฯ แห่งเดียวกัน แต่ผลที่ตามมาก็คือ ผู้ดูแลสภาแห่งนี้ ไม่ได้ลงเอยด้วยการมีอำนาจในการตัดสินใจมากพอ ส่วนในระบบที่ดำเนินการด้วยคอมพิวเตอร์ การกระจายศูนย์เชิงสถาปัตยกรรมอาจจะเกิดขึ้น แต่ไม่ใช่การรวมศูนย์เชิงการเมือง ถ้าชุมชนออนไลน์ใช้ฟอรั่มแบบรวมศูนย์เพื่อความสะดวก แต่ได้มีการทำสัญญาประชาคมที่ถูกยอมรับอย่างกว้างขวางภายในกลุ่มแล้วว่า ถ้าเจ้าของฟอรั่มเกิดประสงค์ร้ายขึ้นมา ทุกคนจะพร้อมใจย้ายไปใช้ฟอรั่มอื่น (ชุมชนที่ก่อตัวจากการต่อต้านสิ่งที่พวกเขาเล็งเห็นว่าเป็นการปิดปากในฟอรั่มอื่นๆ มักจะมีคุณสมบัติเช่นนี้ในทางปฏิบัติ)\n\nการรวมศูนย์เชิงตรรกะจะทำให้การกระจายศูนย์เชิงสถาปัตยกรรมเกิดได้ยากขึ้น แต่ก็ไม่ใช่ว่าจะเป็นเรื่องที่ไปไม่ได้ ดูอย่างเครือข่ายฉันทามติ (consensus) แบบกระจายศูนย์ที่แสดงให้เห็นแล้วว่ามันใช้การได้จริง แต่อาจจะยากกว่าการบำรุงรักษาบิตทอร์เรนต์ นอกจากนั้น การรวมศูนย์เชิงตรรกะจะทำให้การกระจายศูนย์เชิงการเมืองเกิดขึ้นได้ยากขึ้น มันยากที่จะ[คลี่คลายปัญหา](http://www.coindesk.com/hard-fork-ethereum-dao/)ของ[ข้อขัดแย้งอันรุนแรง](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversy)ภายในระบบที่ใช้ตรรกะเชิงรวมศูนย์ ด้วยเพียงแค่ “การที่ทุกคนตกลงยอมให้แต่ละคนทำตามที่ตัวเองต้องการและเดินหน้ากันต่อไป”\n\n### เหตุผลสามข้อของการกระจายศูนย์\n\nคำถามต่อไปคือ ทำไมการกระจายศูนย์ถึงมีประโยชน์ตั้งแต่แรก? มีข้อโต้แย้งหลายๆ ข้อที่มักจะถูกยกขึ้นมา:\n\n* ความทนทานต่อความผิดพลาด - ระบบแบบกระจายศูนย์มีแนวโน้มที่จะล้มเหลวโดยบังเอิญน้อยกว่า เพราะพวกมันพึ่งพาส่วนประกอบที่แยกส่วนกันซึ่งมีความไปได้ต่ำว่าจะล้มเหลว\n* ความต้านทานต่อการถูกโจมตี - การโจมตี ทำลาย หรือแทรกแซงระบบกระจายศูนย์มีค่าใช้จ่ายที่แพงกว่ามาก เนื่องจากระบบเช่นนี้ไม่มี[จุดเปราะบาง](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Thermal_exhaust_port)ที่สามารถโจมตีได้ด้วยค่าใช้จ่ายต่ำกว่าขนาดเศรษฐกิจโดยรวมของระบบทั้งหมดอย่างมีนัยยะ\n* การป้องกันการสมรู้ร่วมคิด - เป็นเรื่องยากมากที่ผู้มีส่วนร่วมในระบบกระจายศูนย์จะรวมหัวกันลับหลังเพื่อหาผลประโยชน์ส่วนตน แต่เป็นผลร้ายแก่ผู้อื่น เหมือนกับการที่ผู้นำองค์กรและรัฐบาลฮั้วกันเพื่อประโยชน์ของพวกพ้องตน แต่ทำร้ายกลุ่มคนที่อาจจะร่วมมือกันได้ไม่ดีเท่าอย่างพลเมือง ลูกค้า ลูกจ้าง และประชาชนซึ่งเป็นเช่นนี้อยู่อย่างเนืองนิจ\n\nสามข้อโต้แย้งนี้ต่างมีความสำคัญและสมเหตุสมผลมาก แต่อย่างไรก็ตาม เหตุผลทั้งสามข้อนี้สามารถนำไปสู่ข้อสรุปที่น่าสนใจในรูปแบบต่างๆ เมื่อคุณเริ่มคิดถึงการตัดสินใจในระดับโพรโทคอลที่ตั้งอยู่บนทัศนคติที่แตกต่างกันทั้งสามนี้ ลองมาขยายความแต่ละเหตุผลและไล่เรียงกันไปทีละข้อ\n\nสำหรับความทนทานต่อความผิดพลาด หัวใจของเหตุผลนี้แสนเรียบง่าย อะไรน่าจะมีโอกาสเกิดขึ้นได้น้อยกว่ากัน: ระหว่างคอมพิวเตอร์ตัวนึงล่ม หรือคอมพิวเตอร์ห้าตัวจากทั้งหมดสิบตัวล่มพร้อมกัน? หลักการนี้ไม่ได้เป็นประเด็นที่เปราะบาง และถูกใช้ในหลายสถานการณ์จริง ตั้งแต่เครื่องยนต์ของเครื่องบิน, [เครื่องปั่นไฟสำรอง](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_power_system)ที่ใช้ในสถานที่อย่างโรงพยาบาล, โครงสร้างพื้นฐานทางการทหาร, การกระจายการลงทุนในพอร์ตโฟลิโอการเงิน, และแน่นอน เครือข่ายคอมพิวเตอร์\\*\\*\n\nแต่กระนั้น การกระจายศูนย์ประเภทนี้ ถึงแม้จะมีประสิทธิภาพและมีความสำคัญอย่างสูง มันมักจะได้ผลที่ใช้ได้กับทุกสถานการณ์น้อยพอๆ กับการคาดการณ์ของโมเดลทางคณิศาสตร์อันไร้เดียงสาเสียมากกว่า เหตุผลก็คือความล้มเหลวพร้อมกัน (common mode failure) แน่นอนว่าเครื่องยนต์ของเครื่องบินสี่ตัวมีโอกาสที่จะล้มเหลวพร้อมกันน้อยกว่าเครื่องยนต์เพียงตัวเดียว แต่ถ้าเครื่องยนต์ทั้งสี่ตัวถูกสร้างจากโรงงานเดียวกัน และความผิดพลาดภายในเครื่องยนต์ทั้งสี่เกิดจากลูกจ้างจอมทุจริตคนเดียวกันล่ะ?\n\nบล็อกเชนในรูปแบบปัจจุบัน \\[ปี 2017\\] สามารถป้องกันความล้มเหลวพร้อมกันได้หรือไม่? ก็อาจจะไม่ได้ทุกครั้ง ลองพิจารณาสถานการณ์ต่อไปนี้:\n\n* โหนด (node) ทุกตัวในบล็อกเชนทำงานอยู่บนซอฟต์แวร์ไคลเอ็นต์ (software client) เดียวกัน และปรากฏว่าซอฟต์แวร์ไคลเอ็นต์ตัวนี้เกิดมีบั๊ก\n* โหนดทุกตัวในบล็อกเชนทำงานอยู่บนซอฟต์แวร์ไคลเอ็นต์เดียวกัน และทีมนักพัฒนาซอฟต์แวร์นี้ ปรากฏว่าเป็นพวกสามานย์\n* ทีมนักวิจัยที่ทำข้อเสนอการอัพเกรดของโพรโทคอล กลายเป็นพวกคนสามานย์\n* ในบล็อกเชนแบบ Proof of Work (PoW) กว่า 70 เปอร์เซ็นต์ของนักขุดอยู่ในประเทศเดียวกัน และรัฐบาลของประเทศนั้นเกิดตัดสินใจที่จะยึดเหมืองขุดทั้งหมดด้วยเหตุผลทางความมั่นคงของชาติ\n* ฮาร์ดแวร์สำหรับการขุดส่วนใหญ่ถูกสร้างโดยบริษัทเดียวกัน และบริษัทนี้ถูกติดสินบนหรือถูกจูงจมูกให้สร้างประตูหลังบ้านที่สามารถปิดฮาร์ดแวร์ได้ตามอำเภอใจ\n* ในบล็อกเชนแบบ Proof of Stake (PoS) เหรียญกว่า 70 เปอร์เซ็นต์ถูก stake ไว้กับกระดานเทรดเพียงเจ้าเดียว\n\nมุมมองแบบองค์รวมต่อการกระจายศูนย์เพื่อความทนทานต่อความผิดพลาดจะพิจารณาจากหลักเกณฑ์เหล่านี้ทั้งหมด และดูว่าจะสามารถลดความเสี่ยงที่จะเกิดสิ่งเหล่านี้ให้น้อยที่สุดอย่างไร ข้อสรุปบางอย่างที่อุบัติขึ้นก็ค่อนข้างชัดเจน:\n\n* มันสำคัญมากที่จะต้องมี[การลงมือหลากหลายรูปแบบที่เพื่อให้เกิดการแข่งขัน](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3pdskt/how_many_ethereum_implementations_are_there/)\n* [ความรู้ความเข้าใจ](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues)ของ[การพิจารณา](https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/the-history-of-casper-chapter-2-8e09b9d3b780)ทาง[เทคนิคด้านต่างๆ](https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/the-history-of-casper-part-1-59233819c9a9)[

เพื่อให้มีคนจำนวนมากขึ้นรู้สึกสบายใจที่จะเข้ามา[มีส่วนร่วม](https://gitter.im/ethereum/casper-scaling-and-protocol-economics)พูดคุยเกี่ยวกับงานวิจัย และวิพากษ์วิจารณ์การเปลี่ยนแปลงโพรโทคอลที่เห็นได้ชัดว่าไม่ได้เรื่อง\n* ทีมนักพัฒนาหลักและทีมนักวิจัยควรจะเป็นทีมที่มาจาก[หลายๆ](http://ethereum.org/) [บริษัท](http://ethcore.io/)[หรือ](https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/01/19/update-integrating-zcash-ethereum/)[องค์กร](http://ether.camp/) (หรืออีกทางเลือกหนึ่งก็คือ หลายๆ คนอาจจะเป็นอาสาสมัครก็ได้)\n* อัลกอริทึมสำหรับการขุดควรจะถูกออกแบบมาเพื่อ[ลดความเสี่ยงของการรวมศูนย์](http://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash)\n* ในโลกอุดมคติ เราจะใช้ [Proof of Stake](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ) เพื่อก้าวออกจากความเสี่ยงของการรวมศูนย์ในฝั่งฮาร์ดแวร์ (ทั้งนี้ เราต้องพึงระวังความเสี่ยงอื่นๆ ที่จะเกิดขึ้นตามมาจาก Proof of Stake ด้วยเช่นกัน)\n\nอย่าลืมว่าสิ่งที่จำเป็นสำหรับความทนทานต่อความล้มเหลวในรูปแบบตั้งต้น จะมุ่งเน้นไปที่การกระจายศูนย์เชิงสถาปัตยกรรม แต่ทว่าเมื่อใดที่คุณเริ่มคิดเกี่ยวกับความทนทานต่อความล้มเหลวของชุมชนที่ดูแลการพัฒนาโพรโทคอลที่กำลังดำเนินการอยู่ เมื่อนั้นการกระจายศูนย์เชิงการเมืองก็จะเป็นเรื่องที่สำคัญไม่ยิ่งหย่อนไปกว่ากัน\n\nคราวนี้ เราลองมาดูในฝั่งของความต้านทานต่อการถูกโจมตีบ้าง ในโมเดลจำลองทางเศรษฐศาสตร์แบบเพียวๆ บางอัน คุณอาจจะเจอผลลัพธ์ว่าในบางครั้งการกระจายศูนย์ก็ไม่ได้มีผลอะไรเลย ถ้าคุณสร้างโพรโทคอลที่รับประกันว่าวาลิเดเตอร์ (validator) จะต้องสูญเสียเงินจำนวน 50 ล้านเหรียญฯ หากเกิดการโจมตี 51เปอร์เซ็นต์ (51% attack) (เช่น การยกเลิกยอดบัญชีที่ถูกบันทึกไปแล้ว (finality reversion)) ด้วยเหตุนี้ มันไม่ได้สลักสำคัญอะไรเลย ถ้าวาลิเดเตอร์ทั้งหลายจะถูกควบคุมโดยบริษัทแห่งเดียวหรือหนึ่งร้อยบริษัท เนื่องจากมาร์จิ้นความมั่นคงทางเศรษฐกิจจำนวน 50 ล้านเหรียญฯ ก็ยังเท่ากับมาร์จิ้นความมั่นคงทางเศรษฐกิจจำนวน 50 ล้านเหรียญฯ ความจริงแล้ว[เหตุผล](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825610000394)ทาง[ทฤษฎีเกม](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)[เชิงลึก](http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem) ว่าทำไมการรวมศูนย์นั้นอาจจะช่วยทำให้ความตระหนักรู้เกี่ยวกับความมั่นคงทางเศรษฐกิจให้เพิ่มสูงสุด (โมเดลการคัดเลือกธุรกรรมในบล็อกเชนที่มีอยู่ ณ ปัจจุบัน \\[ปี 2017\\] ได้สะท้อนถึงข้อมูลเชิงลึกนี้ เพราะการรวมธุรกรรมเข้าไปในบล็อกผ่านนักขุด/ผู้เสนอบล็อก แท้จริงแล้วเป็นเผด็จการที่มีการหมุนเวียนอย่างรวดเร็ว)\n\nอย่างไรก็ตาม เมื่อคุณได้เปิดรับโมเดลเศรษฐกิจที่อุดมสมบูรณ์กว่า และโดยเฉพาะโมเดลที่ยอมรับว่ามีความเป็นไปได้ที่จะเกิดการบีบบังคับขู่เข็ญ (หรือสิ่งที่ร้ายแรงน้อยกว่านั้น เช่น การโจมตี DoS ที่พุ่งเป้าไปยังโหนด) การกระจายศูนย์จะมีความสำคัญมากยิ่งขึ้น ถ้าคุณเกิดขู่กรรโชกใครคนหนึ่งด้วยความตาย เงินจำนวน 50 ล้านเหรียญฯ จะหมดความหมายสำหรับพวกเขาในทันที แต่ถ้าเงินจำนวน 50 ล้านเหรียญฯ ถูกกระจายไปให้คนสิบคน คุณจะต้องขู่กรรโชกคนเพิ่มขึ้นเป็นสิบเท่าตัว และยังต้องลงมือข่มขู่ทุกคนพร้อมๆ กันอีกด้วย โดยทั่วไปแล้ว โลกสมัยใหม่ในหลายๆ ครั้งถูกนิยามลักษณะผ่านความไม่สมมาตรของการโจมตี/การป้องกัน ซึ่งมักจะเอื้อประโยชน์ต่อผู้โจมตี ยกตัวอย่างเช่น ตึกที่มีค่าใช้จ่ายในการก่อสร้างเป็นจำนวนเงิน 10 ล้านเหรียญฯ อาจจะใช้เงินน้อยกว่า 100,000 เหรียญฯ ในการทำลาย แต่ทั้งนี้การยกระดับ (leverage) ของผู้โจมตีมักจะเป็นแบบ sublinear เช่น ถ้าตึกแห่งหนึ่งใช้เงินจำนวน 10 ล้านเหรียญฯ ในการก่อสร้าง และใช้เงิน 100,000 เหรียญฯ ในการทำลาย ตึกที่ใช้เงินหนึ่งล้านเหรียญฯ ในการสร้าง ตามความจริงแล้วก็น่าจะใช้เงินประมาณ 30,000 เหรียญฯ ในการทำลาย ยิ่งจำนวนน้อยยิ่งให้อัตราส่วนที่ดี\n\nแล้วการพินิจพิเคราะห์เช่นนี้จะนำไปสู่อะไร? ลำดับแรก มันให้ประโยชน์ฝั่ง Proof of Stake เหนือฝั่ง Proof of Work อย่างยิ่งยวด เพราะฮาร์ดแวร์คอมพิวเตอร์นั้นง่ายต่อการแกะรอย, ควบคุม, และโจมตี ส่วนเหรียญนั้น สามารถถูกเก็บซ่อนได้ง่ายกว่ามาก (นอกจากนี้ Proof of Stake ยังสามารถต่อต้านการโดนโจมตีได้อย่างแข็งแกร่งเพราะ[เหตุผลประการอื่นๆ ด้วย](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/a-proof-of-stake-design-philosophy-506585978d51)) ลำดับที่สอง มันเป็นเหตุผลของการสนับสนุนให้เกิดการกระจายตัวของทีมนักพัฒนาไปในวงกว้าง ซึ่งรวมไปถึงการกระจายตัวทางภูมิศาสตร์ ลำดับที่สาม มันเป็นการกล่าวอย่างกลายๆ ว่าทั้งโมเดลทางเศรษฐศาสตร์และโมเดลการต่อต้านความล้มเหลวจำเป็นต้องถูกนำมาพิจารณาระหว่างการออกแบบโพรโทคอลฉันทามติด้วย\n\nสุดท้าย เรามาถึงเหตุผลที่สลับซับซ้อนมากที่สุดในบรรดาทั้งสามข้อ นั่นคือการป้องกันการสมรู้ร่วมคิด การสมรู้ร่วมคิดเป็นคำที่ยากต่อการนิยาม ไม่แน่ว่าทางเดียวที่สมเหตุสมผลที่จะอธิบายว่ามันคืออะไร อาจจะเป็นการกล่าวว่าการสมรู้ร่วมคิดคือ “การร่วมมือที่เราไม่ชอบใจ” มีหลายสถานการณ์ในชีวิตจริงที่แม้ว่าทุกคนจะสามารถร่วมมือกันได้จะอุดมคติ แต่การที่คนกลุ่มย่อยกลุ่มหนึ่งสามารถร่วมมือกัน*ในขณะที่คนอื่นๆ ไม่สามารถทำได้* จะเป็นเรื่องที่อันตรายอย่างยิ่ง\n\nตัวอย่างง่ายๆ คือ กฎหมายป้องกันการผูกขาด กำแพงการควบคุมที่ถูกสร้างไว้ด้วยความตั้งใจที่จะให้คนฝั่งหนึ่งในตลาดมารวมตัวกัน และทำตัวเป็นกลุ่มผู้ผูกขาด พร้อมได้กำไรนอกระบบ โดยทำให้คนอื่นที่อยู่อีกฝั่งของตลาด และความเป็นอยู่ทั่วไปในสังคมเกิดความเสียหายกลายเป็นเรื่องยาก อีกตัวอย่างหนึ่งคือ[กฎเพื่อต่อต้านการร่วมมือกันระหว่างผู้สมัครและกลุ่มคณะกรรมการดำเนินการทางการเมือง (super PACs) ในสหรัฐอเมริกา](https://www.publicintegrity.org/2012/01/13/7866/rules-against-coordination-between-super-pacs-candidates-tough-enforce) ซึ่งผ่านการพิสูจน์มาแล้วว่าไม่ง่ายที่จะบังคับใช้ในทางปฏิบัติ อีกตัวอย่างที่เล็กลงมาหน่อย คือกฎใน[การแข่งขันหมากรุกบางรายการ](https://www.chesskid.com/article/view/heres-a-chance-to-play-magnus-carlsen)ที่ป้องกันให้ผู้เล่นสองคนมาแข่งกันหลายครั้งเพื่อพยายามจะเพิ่มคะแนนให้ผู้เล่นคนหนึ่ง ไม่ว่าคุณจะมองไปที่ใด ความพยายามที่จะป้องกันการร่วมมือที่ไม่เป็นที่ต้องการในสถาบันชั้นนำก็สามารถพบเห็นได้ทุกหนทุกแห่ง\n\nในกรณีโพรโทคอลบล็อกเชน การพินิจพิเคราะห์ทางคณิตศาสตร์และเศรษฐศาสตร์ที่อยู่เบื้องหลังเกราะกำบังของฉันทามติ มักจะพึ่งพาโมเดลตัวเลือกแบบไม่ร่วมมือกัน หรือการอนุมานว่าเกมประกอบไปด้วยผู้เล่นตัวเล็กหลายๆ คนที่ตัดสินใจด้วยตนเอง ถ้าเมื่อใดที่มีผู้เล่นคนไหนเกิดมีพลังการขุดมากกว่า ⅓ ในระบบ Proof of Work พวกเขาจะสามารถได้รับกำไรก้อนใหญ่มหาศาลผ่าน[การขุดแบบเห็นแก่ตัว](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0243) แต่กระนั้น เราสามารถพูดได้อย่างเต็มปากเต็มคำหรือว่าโมเดลตัวเลือกแบบไม่ร่วมมือกันนั้นสามารถปฏิบัติได้จริง เมื่อเครือข่ายการขุดของบิตคอยน์กว่า 90 เปอร์เซ็นร่วมมือกันได้ดีในระดับที่สามารถโผล่มาที่งานสัมมนาเดียวกันได้อย่างพร้อมหน้าพร้อมตา?\n\nฝ่ายสนับสนุนบล็อกเชนยังสามารถทำให้เห็นถึงเหตุผลว่า การสร้างบนบล็อกเชนนั้นปลอดภัยกว่าเพราะพวกเขาไม่สามารถเปลี่ยนกฎได้ตามอำเภอใจเมื่อไหร่ก็ได้ แต่กรณีนี้อาจจะแก้ต่างได้ยากถ้านักพัฒนาซอฟต์แวร์และโพรโทคอลทั้งหมดต่างทำงานภายใต้บริษัทเดียวกัน และเป็นส่วนหนึ่งของครอบครัวใหญ่ ที่นั่งทำงานในห้องเดียวกัน ความสำคัญทั้งหมดทั้งมวลนี้คือ ระบบเหล่านี้ไม่ควรทำตัวราวกับกลุ่มก้อนของผู้ผูกขาดที่สนใจแต่ประโยชน์ส่วนตน ดังนั้น คุณสามารถกล่าวได้อย่างเต็มปากว่าบล็อกเชนจะปลอดภัยมากกว่าถ้าพวกเขา*ร่วมมือกับใครไม่ได้เสียเลย* (discoordinated) เสียมากกว่า\n\nแต่กระนั้นก็ดี ประเด็นนี้ได้แสดงให้เห็นความย้อนแยงในระดับพื้นฐาน ชุมชนหลายๆ แห่งรวมไปถึงอีเธอเรียม มักจะถูกชื่นชมว่ามีสปิริตที่แข็งแกร่ง และสามารถร่วมแรงร่วมใจกันพัฒนา, ปล่อย และ[เปิดใช้งาน hard fork](https://www.ethnews.com/ethereum-founder-suggests-hard-fork-to-stop-dos-attacks) ได้อย่างรวดเร็ว เพื่อแก้ปัญหาการปฏิเสธการให้บริการ (denial-of-service) ในโพรโทคอลภายในหกวัน แต่จะทำอย่างไรให้เราสามารถส่งเสริมและพัฒนาการร่วมมือในรูปแบบที่ดีงามเช่นนี้ แต่ในขณะเดียวกันป้องกัน “การร่วมมือที่เลวร้าย” ที่เกิดจากนักขุดพยายามจะเอาเปรียบคนอื่นๆ ผ่านการร่วมมือเพื่อโจมตีแบบ 51 เปอร์เซ็นต์?\n\nในการตอบคำถามนี้ มีสามทางด้วยกัน:\n\n* ไม่ต้องสนใจที่จะหยุดยั้งการร่วมมือกันแบบที่ไม่เป็นที่ต้องการ แต่พยายามสร้างโพรโทคอลที่สามารถต่อต้านมันได้ดีกว่า\n* พยายามหาสื่อที่ดีที่ทำให้เกิดการร่วมมือในระดับที่จะทำให้โพรโทคอลพัฒนาไปข้างหน้าไป แต่ไม่เพียงพอที่จะทำให้เกิดการโจมตีได้\n* พยายามหาข้อแตกต่างระหว่างการร่วมมือที่มีประโยชน์และการร่วมมือที่เป็นอันตราย และทำข้อแรกให้ง่ายลง ทำข้อหลังให้ยากขึ้น\n\nวิธีแรกเป็น[ส่วนประกอบขนาดใหญ่](https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/the-history-of-casper-chapter-4-3855638b5f0e#.36ojr6ybl)ของปรัญชาการออกแบบแคสเปอร์ (Casper) แต่กระนั้น โดยลำพังแค่ตัวมันเองนั้นไม่เพียงพอ เพราะการพึ่งพาเศรษฐศาสตร์เพียงอย่างเดียวไม่สามารถจัดการกับข้อกังวลอีกสองข้อเกี่ยวกับการกระจายศูนย์ได้ ส่วนข้อที่สองนั้นยากที่จะออกแบบและสร้างให้เป็นรูปธรรม โดยเฉพาะในระยะยาว แต่มันมักจะเกิดขึ้นด้วยความบังเอิญ ยกตัวอย่างเช่น ข้อเท็จจริงที่ว่านักพัฒนาหลักของบิตคอยน์มักจะพูดภาษาอังกฤษแต่เหล่านักขุดส่วนใหญ่พูดภาษาจีนถือได้ว่าเป็นความบังเอิญที่น่ายินดี เพราะมันได้ทำให้เกิดการปกครองโดยใช้ “ระบบสองสภา” (bicameral) ที่ทำให้การร่วมมือกันยากขึ้นไปอีก ซึ่งมีข้อดีข้างเคียงด้วยการลดความเสี่ยงของการเกิดความล้มเหลวพร้อมกัน เนื่องจากทั้งชุมชนที่ใช้ภาษาอังกฤษและชุมชนที่ใช้ภาษาจีนน่าจะมีการพูดคุยกันด้วยเหตุผล ซึ่งน่าจะเป็นบทสนทนาที่แยกวงกัน เนื่องจากระยะทางที่ห่างกันและความยากในการสื่อสาร เพราะฉะนั้นความเป็นไปที่คนทั้งสองกลุ่มจะทำผิดพลาดในเรื่องเดียวกันได้น้อยลง\n\nข้อที่สามนั้นเป็นความท้าทายในฝั่งสังคมเหนือสิ่งอื่นใด ทางออกในส่วนนี้อาจจะรวมไปถึง:\n\n* การแทรกแซงทางสังคมที่พยายามจะเพิ่มความจงรักภักดีของผู้เข้าร่วมที่มีต่อชุมชนที่เกี่ยวกับบล็อกเชนโดยรวม และทดแทนหรือขัดขวางเพื่อลดความเป็นไปได้ที่ผู้เล่นในฝั่งหนึ่งของตลาดจะหันมาภักดีกันเอง\n* สนับสนุนการสื่อสารระหว่าง “ฝั่งต่างๆ ภายในตลาด” ด้วยบริบทเดียวกัน เพื่อลดความเป็นไปได้ที่กลุ่มวาลิเดเตอร์, กลุ่มนักพัฒนา, หรือกลุ่มนักขุด จะเริ่มเห็นตัวเองเป็น “ชนชั้น” ซึ่งควรทำงานร่วมกันเพื่อปกป้องผลประโยชน์ของตัวเองจากชนชั้นอื่นๆ\n* ออกแบบโพรโทคอลในรูปแบบที่จะลดแรงจูงใจสำหรับวาลิเดเตอร์/นักขุด ให้เข้าไปข้องแวะกับ “ความสัมพันธ์สุดพิเศษ” แบบหนึ่งต่อหนึ่ง หรือระบบเครือข่ายการถ่ายโอนข้อมูลแบบรวมศูนย์ และกลไกที่มีความคล้ายคลึงกับซุปเปอร์โพรโทรคอลยักษ์ใหญ่\n* บรรทัดฐานที่ชัดเจนว่าคุณสมบัติพื้นฐานที่โพรโทคอลควรจะมีมีอะไรบ้าง และสิ่งที่ไม่ควรจะทำ หรืออย่างน้อยทำได้แค่ภายในสถานการณ์สุดโต่งไม่คาดฝัน\n\nการกระจายศูนย์แบบที่สามนี้ ซึ่งคือการกระจายศูนย์ในฐานะการหลีกเลี่ยงความร่วมมืออันไม่เป็นที่ต้องการ น่าจะเป็นข้อที่ทำได้ยากที่สุด และการต้องแลกมาซึ่งบางอย่างไม่สามารถหลีกเลี่ยงได้ ทางออกที่ดีที่สุดอาจจะเป็นการพึ่งพิงคนกลุ่มหนึ่งที่รับประกันได้ว่าพวกเขากระจายศูนย์ในระดับหนึ่ง นั่นก็คือกลุ่มผู้ใช้งานโพรโทคอลนั่นเอง\n\n\n---\n\n**เกี่ยวกับผู้เขียน**\n[วิทาลิก บิวเทอริน (Vitalik Buterin)](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin) คือนักวิจัย โปรแกรมเมอร์ นักคิด นักเขียน

{"id": "IK0oQyio6hyvQZHtpsp8c9WWoGBDpA4dJkFVAvLVDrM", "title": "Future of your Ethereum wallets", "body": "GM Everyone!\n\nWe all want to know what is next in the web3 world. Today we will deep-diving into the future of Ethereum wallets & how it will change the experience for both developers & users.\n\nOne word answer for what is coming next to Ethereum is Account Abstraction. It will change how we authorize transactions & interact with blockchains. The change will open the possibilities of having recovery wallets, username-passwords wallets, paying gas fees in tokens other than ETH, or getting gas fees sponsored and having a gassless experience.\n\nLet us dive into how all of this is possible?\n\n### Account Abstraction\n\nSo you might have come across this word already. Vitalik has been asking for it since Feb ’20, you can see its birth [here.](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/implementing-account-abstraction-as-part-of-eth1-x/4020)\n\nBut Why account abstraction? What is account abstraction? How account abstraction works?\n\n> **Why account abstraction?**\n\nCurrently, in Ethereum every transaction has to be signed by an externally owned account (EOA, like metamask, trust wallet, etc.). This signature acts as the authorization mechanism. Miners are looking for transactions in the public mempool. These miners first verify the signature of each and every transaction before picking it up for execution.\n\nThe process of signing every transaction have the following problems:\n\n1. A single way to verify a transaction’s authenticity. If this is compromised, the whole blockchain is compromised.\n2. A single point of failure, your private key/mnemonic. Once this is compromised, all your funds are compromised\n3. Stuck with the blockchain’s native token for everything we need to do on the blockchain.\n\nLet's dive into each one of the above-listed problems in detail.\n\n**A single way to verify a transaction’s authenticity**\n\nOne of the biggest problems with the currect architecture of Ethereum is that there is only a single way to verify a transaction’s authenticity. All transactions must be signed with an ECDSA to prove their authenticity. What if we get some vulnerability in the current algorithm (ECDSA) in the future? What about quantum computers, we know [quantum computers are coming and can break ECDSA](https://pqcrypto.org/index.html).\n\nThe problem is that if we ever have to change the algorithm to authorize transactions in the future, we will have to send an update to all the ETH nodes. For context, the current process of pushing updates to ETH nodes is through voting. The majority of the nodes have to vote in favour and pass the change. Once voted on, the change has to be planned and rolled out with proper tests. What if this takes 6 months? If there was a vulnerability in our authorization layer then all our accounts will be exposed to attacks & hacks until the change has been passed, tested & deployed to all the eth nodes.\n\n**A single point of failure, your private key/mnemonic**\n\nAnother problem in the current architecture is the single point of failure, i.e EOAs. You get a mnemonic when you create your account. That mnemonic is the access to all your crypto funds forever. There is no way to change the mnemonic, what if you forget the mnemonic? The funds are lost forever!! What if someone steals your mnemonic?? Well, write a script to transfer all your funds ASAP! (ps: the hacker already has that script and your funds are already gone). You see the problem, everything boils down to your mnemonic. Once your mnemonic is compromised, your funds are not secure anymore.\n\n**Stuck with the blockchain’s native token**\n\nThe current consensus layer also forces everyone to pay gas fees in ETH. While I love ETH & would love to hodl it for long. I would want some predictability in my wallet & have most of my liquid funds in some sort of stablecoins. There is no way for me to pay gas fees in stable coins with EOAs. The flexibility of paying fees in any other coin or method except for the native blockchain coin is impossible. This inflexibility will lead to problems in scaling Ethereum to billions of people.\n\n> ### What is account abstraction?\n\nAccount abstraction is an initiative toward solving the above problems. The latest initiative is drafted in [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). The protocol allows users to have smart contract wallets without any change to the current consensus layer. This will allow users to have their preferred way of authenticity, allow users to recover or change their proof of authenticity, and also allow users to pay gas or let others pay gas on their behalf.\n\n> **How account abstraction works?**\n\nAfter multiple attempts from the Eth community, they have settled on [EIP 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). This protocol was the preferred choice because it did not need any change to the current consensus layer.\n\nI will try and briefly explain how this EIP works and how it will abstract accounts for us. Let us first list down the components of this EIP:\n\n1. User operation\n2. Bundlers\n3. Entry Point Contract (EPC)\n4. Wallet Contract\n5. Paymaster Contract\n\n**The journey** \n\nThe journey starts with a user’s intention to execute an operation on the chain. The user then will bundle their intention of the execution in an object called, User Operation. A user operation describes the following\n\n1. User’s execution code\n2. User’s operation’s authenticity proof\n3. Wallet creation code if the wallet doesn’t exist on the chain as of now\n4. The max amount of gas that is allowed to be exhausted for the operation\n5. Paymaster information, a paymaster is a contract that is ready to pay the gas fee instead of the user for the above-stated operation\n\nWhat is the difference between a transaction versus a user operation? Transactions are fully signed (according to ECDSA) instructions from the account (EOA). While user operations are not signed but do contain proof of their authenticity & instructions that are to be executed. The proof though may not be according to ECDSA standards. The proof’s authenticity has to be decided by the smart contract wallet where the account is hosted and the consensus layer has no say on the user operation’s proof.\n\nOnce the user has created the User Operation, they send it to the public network for Bundlers to pick this operation & execute it on the chain. Bundlers are nodes who are ready to process these user operations. Bundlers can sort these user operations based on their gas fees and the reward they can earn by processing the operation successfully.\n\nHow are bundlers different from miners? Miners pick transactions that reward them and execute them, while bundlers pick user operations that reward them and execute them. In theory, a miner could become a bundler as well. But before Account Abstraction becomes mainstream, we expect there to be a smaller set of bundlers in the ecosystem than miners.\n\nBundlers then route each and every user’s operations through an Entry Point Contract. The role of the Entry Point Contract is to route the user operation through its wallet’s smart contract and get it authenticated from the contract. Along with the operation’s authenticity, the Entry Point contract also verifies if the wallet has enough balance to pay for the gas fees & reward for the bundler.\n\nIf the wallet’s contract is not deployed Entry Point will also deploy the wallet and then verify the operation.\n\nOnce the operation is verified, it will also verify the paymaster (if specified) & verify if the paymaster has enough balance to pay for the user’s operation.\n\nIn the above verification process itself, either the wallet or the paymaster has to transfer the maximum amount of gas required for the successful execution of the operation.\n\nComing back to our verification, upon successful verification of operation & paymaster, the Entry Point will then pass the complete user operation to the Wallet contract for it to execute.\n\nPost the execution of the operation, Entry Point will refund the extra unutilized gas left back to the wallet/paymaster (depending on who paid earlier). If a paymaster was involved Entry Point will also call its *postOp* function to inform it about the exact amount of gas used for this operation. This will allow the paymaster to keep a track of the payments it is sponsoring.\n\nThis is how we will be able to in future solve the three problems stated above. The architecture allows users to\n\n1. Have multiple ways to verify a transaction’s authenticity.\n2. Generate a new signature & discard the old one.\n3. Stop any transactions from their wallet if their signature has been compromised.\n4. Transfer funds to their nominees in case of the death of the owner of the wallet.\n5. Pay gas fees in a token different from ETH.\n6. A gasless experience if another party (paymaster) is ready to sponsor their transactions.\n\nI did not get a lot of time to go in deep into each and every component of the EIP.

Your browser will redirect to your requested content shortly.\n[opensea.io](http://opensea.io)\nnext+团购项目名字和代币名字，选择时间期限，然后点击preview\n支付gas确认成功，就完成了。\n\n这里我个人建议：\n\n发起方最好采取多签钱包，这样重要的nft不会由于单地址泄漏而造成不必要的麻烦与风险。理论上并且发起方是触碰不到参与人的资金与份额权益的。\n\n多签教程：1拥有多签钱包，自建或者联合其他人社团人一起做多签钱包。\n\n链接：gnosis safe\nGnosis Safe\nGnosis Safe\nGnosis Safe is the most trusted platform to manage digital assets on Ethereum\n[gnosis-safe.io](http://gnosis-safe.io)\n\n完成后，多签链接网站后其他操作一样，唯一不同的是以后每一步操作都需要按照多签人的标准执行。\n\n这里是 Kuiclub-Bored Ape Yacht Club 无聊猿猴的多签记录\n\n资金募集满后，选定nft，执行付款操作\n\n我们今天成功的案例：狗不理，丑不林\n\n交互：partybid 到此完成。\n「2」交互Zora\n\n基础任务：创建一个NFT（必须完成）\n\n打开：兔子洞，其实他已经有详细教程（点击此处跳转）\n\n官方：[rabbithole.gg](http://rabbithole.gg)\nBuild your onchain resume\nBuild your onchain resume\nEarn crypto through discovering and using the latest crypto applications\n[app.rabbithole.gg](http://app.rabbithole.gg)\n\n2/链接钱包\n\n（1）点击右上角“+”号，选择“Mint new NFT”\n\n（2）任意上传一张图片，输入标题和描述，任何照片。\n\n（3）设置交易版税（2.5%）确认授权上链，支付GAS，\n\n继续上传填写：\n\n好了，后面简单了，不写了。\n\n稍微想多参与一下交互，就把你mint的nft挂到市场上去买，也可以自卖自夸自买，其他小号。或者买个球当个鸟用。\n3 交互：mirror.xyz\n\n这个简单了，\n\n边做边学，去看这两个就行：\n\n去中心化内容发布平台Mirror使用教程：欢迎来到Web3时代\n去中心化内容发布平台Mirror使用教程：欢迎来到Web3时代\n去中心化内容发布平台Mirror使用教程：欢迎来到Web3时代\n作为Web3时代的早期产品，Mirror虽然有着众筹、拍卖NFT等多样的功能，但是同时也存在着较高的使用门槛\n[www.theblockbeats.info](http://www.theblockbeats.info)\nMirror上的内容真的会永存吗？我们存了一张《清明上河图》\nMirror上的内容真的会永存吗？我们存了一张《清明上河图》\nMirror上的文章是如何被保存到Arweave上的？Mirror上的存储成本又由谁来承担？\n[www.theblockbeats.info](http://www.theblockbeats.info)\n\n完成后上兔子洞，mint，需要付gas费。\n第三章：为什么要去交互这些项目：\n\nzora+party+mirror+兔子洞+bayc无聊猿+doodles\n\nzora投资方很强，nft市场是未来web3一个非常重要的支柱点，类比兔子洞给了明确的方向，就是nft+defi+dao组织。这里会产生无穷无尽的市场，平台生意做起来就是躺赚，交互成本熊市并不高。\n\nparty：PartyDAO 公布了他们拿到 A16z 领投的 1640 万美金融资，估值两亿美金，这是迄今为止社区驱动类 DAO 的最高估值。源于一篇推文，没有创始人，没有中心化团队，绝大部分成员都有自己的本质工作只能业余时间参与，这种有创意的项目市场估值会很高，天花板很高，投筛选项目角度来说，一句给出了方向。交互成本也不高。唯一在于你投资多少。\n\nmirror，web3的创造，众筹，等全方位平台，永久存储等，真正去中心化的产品。发不发币不知道，有时间深度参与每个功能。\n\n兔子洞，很多人在说他不发币，但我在推特已经说了很多了，在你学习成长的阶段，不用在意一个2个项目是否会给你回报，兔子洞的项目已经给予很多人参与web3项目的机会，边学边赚很适合进入web3的人，\n\nbayc无聊猿猴+doodles，我没有发言权，我不太懂nft，我知道很牛逼，狠新潮，很元宇宙，我之前从未买过nft，也就错过了nft的大牛市，真正拥有与热爱可以先从一丁点开始，抛开成见，去追逐彩虹。我们要永远相信明天，等到我们晚年的时候，在落日余晖下，也许是爱人也许是孙辈，也许是老哥老弟，还会撸起袖子，端起百威，吹个牛比，老子当年也是持有猴子的人。\n\ndoodles，我也不太懂，我只在央视新闻看到过这个头像，所以你懂的。\n\n具体的关于doodles的内容我请教过朋友大宇，推特：@BTCdayu，放在后面引用。\n\n```\ndoodles精品研报翻译中，先发英文链接在此帮助大家了解这个项目。 个人观点包括：\n\n一、蓝筹中，唯一刚开始发空投，未发币。\n\n二、蓝筹中，唯一走外延路线项目，不盯着圈内用户。 走圈外路线，目标是通过音乐、游戏、艺术出圈——这是我认为NFT没有上限的重要理由。\n\n三、团队格局执行力和格局OK。执行力看看NYC三天的安排，包括官网专有页面，现场组织有序（提前预约，超大容量，丰富活动，利好宣布等）。包括格局，将售出费用和版税的50%建立社区金库等。 同时，团队对短期炒作没有兴趣，推特没有什么意图带动市场热度的内容（相反的是：某项目的嘲讽纸手）。这对于DOODLES这种定位5-10年发展战略的项目来说很重要。\n\n四、5月份起，新天地格局打开，包括 聘请法瑞尔·威廉姆斯为首席品牌官，法瑞尔是 21 世纪最有影响力和最成功的音乐制作人之一，获得13项格莱美奖，第一张doodles专辑制作中。\n\n聘请 Billboard 前总裁 Julian Holguin 为 Doodles 首席执行官，这个人有着长期、多元而丰富的流行IP增长经验。\n\n这些事，为DOODLES成长为一个顶级IP（远超BAYC的那种）奠定了基础。\n\n不过按照我本人的投资原则“认清形势、抛弃幻想”，需要仔细评估成本，而目前来看，以U计价的话，DOODLES+目前Dooplicator价格为17000U的地板，项目发行时平均成本为3000U，因此并不是想象中的高企。\n\n从我个人角度，这是目前蓝筹中最值得投资的项目。\n\n(6月27日更新)\n\ndoodles2 即将发行，按照官方说法会发布在ETH之外的链，我推测大概率会是SOL链，而SOL链上目前是没有头部的，如果DOODLES过去那么，肯定能成为绝对的头部。而doodles 2与现在的dooplicator密切相关（何种相关未知），我本人是均价3.5+买了一批，并在2.5以下不断补仓，现价2.2，不过挂单仅287个。\n\n我个人的第一大仓位将在近期变为DOODLES，不过考虑到大盘不稳，而且我是以超长期的角度持有，所以会不断往下补，我能接受DOODLES跌到5以下，并继续补。因此，个人操作仅发在社区，但绝对不构成投资建议！doodles精品研报翻译中，先发英文链接在此帮助大家了解这个项目。 个人观点包括： 一、蓝筹中，唯一刚开始发空投，未发币。\n\n二、蓝筹中，唯一走外延路线项目，不盯着圈内用户。 走圈外路线，目标是通过音乐、游戏、艺术出圈——这是我认为NFT没有上限的重要理由。\n\n三、团队格局执行力和格局OK。执行力看看NYC三天的安排，包括官网专有页面，现场组织有序（提前预约，超大容量，丰富活动，利好宣布等）。包括格局，将售出费用和版税的50%建立社区金库等。 同时，团队对短期炒作没有兴趣，推特没有什么意图带动市场热度的内容（相反的是：某项目的嘲讽纸手）。这对于DOODLES这种定位5-10年发展战略的项目来说很重要。\n\n四、5月份起，新天地格局打开，包括 聘请法瑞尔·威廉姆斯为首席品牌官，法瑞尔是 21 世纪最有影响力和最成功的音乐制作人之一，获得13项格莱美奖，第一张doodles专辑制作中。\n\n聘请 Billboard 前总裁 Julian Holguin 为 Doodles 首席执行官，这个人有着长期、多元而丰富的流行IP增长经验。\n\n这些事，为DOODLES成长为一个顶级IP（远超BAYC的那种）奠定了基础。\n\n不过按照我本人的投资原则“认清形势、抛弃幻想”，需要仔细评估成本，而目前来看，以U计价的话，DOODLES+目前Dooplicator价格为17000U的地板，项目发行时平均成本为3000U，因此并不是想象中的高企。\n\n从我个人角度，这是目前蓝筹中最值得投资的项目。\n```\n\n第四章：风险在哪里\n\n1/计价单位资产跌价风险： 投资nft资产为eth计较，存在较大的波动性，\n\n2/标的nft共识价值下跌导致资产降价，甚至归零。\n\n3/相关协议风险，比如partybid的合约，具体的技术实现我本人并不懂。\n\n4/gas费用的支付，在投资并且后期的claim erc-20代币都需要支付油费，熊市gas低的时候大概1u-2u。\n\n5/任何投资且在web3的世界都需要支付gas费或者很多风险，所以不够成任何投资意见（标准版）\n\n6/最后我分享一个我之前随便分享的关于亏钱的理解：一句话概率就是，接受或者控制风险\n\n关于亏钱：我的理解是亏钱是常态，不亏钱才是奇迹，买入的任何资产都有波动大概率买不到最低也卖不到最高，所以这里主要是心态与认知的变现。web3的世界每一笔交互都要与合约互动且消耗gas费用，交互的时候是先花gas且投入资金，直白说如果是撸毛也是一个延迟满足的事，大概率可能毛也没有，所以亏钱是认知，是意识，是常态，是风控，是奉献，是建设·······chinaer老话说“吃亏是福”其实是一种格局，格局\n\n教程写内容真太累，一毛钱不赚费时费力，有这个时间有时候宁愿多去研究项目，多刷交互。", "timestamp": 1658412927, "digest": "70z57pM-zV05CvT65wquHrV40_CcSOtgVJnPUED4w18", "contributor": "0xE722E561963bbfFD24c62BCAdCf8059699a17b53"}

Talk的视频，请不要误会本文章抄袭了其视频，Vic是我的好朋友，我之前协助他对Tableland项目进行了分析，故本文会存在内容与其视频重合，特此说明避免读者产生误会。\n\n我们直接打开其官方文档 https://docs.tableland.xyz/what-is-tableland，会看到它说自己是web3原生的关系表。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jh9GMrhdr1tSQAjaTEqvx.png?height=269&width=1080)\n\n好了这里面临第一个普通人陌生的词汇，关系表是什么？我们平时使用的大部分软件背后都有一个数据库用来存储使用过程中产生的数据，这些数据都会以“表”的形式存储，对，你可以将其理解成就是Excel的表。\n\n那关系表又是什么呢？举个例子，比如美团外卖，它会有商家和用户这两个角色，更专业的称之为实体。\n\n那肯定要有两个表分别存储商家和用户这两类角色的信息。\n\n商家表会有什么呢？店名，电话，地址，营业时间等等，用户表则会有姓名、性别、住址等。在表中，每一“行”就是一个具体的商家或者用户，每一“列”则是它对应的属性即姓名地址什么的。\n\n然后表中还有一个很重要的列，就是ID，每个商家和用户都会有一个ID来标识唯一性，这个ID称之为主键，就像是身份证一样，这样即使有同名的也可以区分出来。\n\n那什么是关系表呢？就是表和表之间是有关联关系的，商家和用户怎么关联起来呢，我们第一时间想到的就是订单，当一个用户给某个商家下了一份订单，于是他们两之间就产生了关联。\n\n同样的也有一个表来存储所有的订单信息，每一行就是一个订单，每一列则是其属性包括下单人、接单商家、下单时间、金额等等。\n\n这时候你会发现，这个订单里一定会有两个属性分别要存储商家与用户这两个角色，一般来说就是会把刚才说到的ID存进去，比如下单人的ID为666，那我在订单表中进行查找时，看到一个叫666的订单，于是我就可以去用户表中检索ID为666的用户找到其具体信息。\n\n为了让大家更直观的理解，粗糙的画了一张示例图，分别为用户表、商家表和订单表，当然在实际的生产开发过程中表的设计肯定不会这样粗糙，按照这样的表设计也肯定是执行不起来的，只是为了让大家更易于理解，此处请勿杠。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xFX-dFVrS9d9h8hb9VxXx.png?height=491&width=1080)\n\n现在你明白什么叫关系表了吧，所以Tableland为什么说自己要做web3原生的关系表呢？我们接着往下看它的文档。\n\n它提出了目前web3数据存储的问题是项目方有被迫有两种选择，要么是把所有的数据存在链上，不过这样gas肯定就炸了，而且链上数据结构也支撑不了我刚才给大家画的那种表关联的复杂结构，另一种则是混合存储，即一部分存在链上，一部分在链下，比如NFT则是把NFT的ID、持有人等存在链上，而NFT的图片、属性等信息存在链下，可以放在IPFS，也甚至可以放在阿里云...\n\n不过这个问题确实是存在的，我之前写的文章提到过如阿狸这种奇怪的项目可以直接把用户的metadata给改了的骚操作。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2cxJMcWuG-ZM_wSiCsVy-.png?height=330&width=1080)\n\n接续看它的文档是如何解决该问题的。\n\n首先其实看到它也不是纯链，而是将区块链、去中心化存储（还是在链下）等揉在了一起。可以看到图中有三层结构，第一层是表现层，用户和前端的NFT、DAO、Dapp等进行交互，第二层是业务层，用来管理和鉴别所有权、数据交互以及计算，第三层是数据层，用来存取数据。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z15oPUrB_nIfhQpAusyhD.png?height=602&width=1080)\n\n其实这样看也没啥，很常规的三层架构，所以其在架构上是没有什么革命性创新的。\n\n那我们再耐下心看看它的实现逻辑，它将数据库分为两部分，链上的访问控制ACL和链下存储表。ACL是啥呢？就是对组织身份角色权限的管理，谁有权限做什么事，所以按照它的说法是把这个管理放在了链上。然后正儿八经的数据存储还是在链下，只是相比于传统的多加了一道ACL的过程。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T5BpzBYTxNposscUCLboO.png?height=256&width=1080)\n\n举个例子易于清晰理解，以前我做一套NFT，把合约发上去后，然后把图片存在IPFS，IPFS是去中心化存储的，里面本身的内容不可修改，我如果想改就必须在合约留个后门，从而我可以重新发一套IPFS文件，然后把合约指向的链接替换了。\n\n但是现在我可以在合约与IPFS中间加一层ACL，去设置某些人可以增删改查某些数据。\n\n通过这张图也可以看到，用户是和合约先进行交互，检查其ACL与owner权限，然后合约将增删改查的请求发送给Tableland进行处理。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w_K4KHUfc6WAg0A2bRDF4.png?height=306&width=1080)\n\n以上内容均为个人研究分享，不构成任何投资建议，因个人视角与认知使得可能具有一定局限性和偏差，欢迎一起交流学习探讨，微信：cj350306878，请备注姓名

Today we will deep-diving into the future of Ethereum wallets & how it will change the experience for both developers & users.\n\nOne word answer for what is coming next to Ethereum is Account Abstraction. It will change how we authorize transactions & interact with blockchains. The change will open the possibilities of having recovery wallets, username-passwords wallets, paying gas fees in tokens other than ETH, or getting gas fees sponsored and having a gassless experience.\n\nLet us dive into how all of this is possible?\n\n### Account Abstraction\n\nSo you might have come across this word already. Vitalik has been asking for it since Feb ’20, you can see its birth [here.](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/implementing-account-abstraction-as-part-of-eth1-x/4020)\n\nBut Why account abstraction? What is account abstraction? How account abstraction works?\n\n> **Why account abstraction?**\n\nCurrently, in Ethereum every transaction has to be signed by an externally owned account (EOA, like metamask, trust wallet, etc.). This signature acts as the authorization mechanism. Miners are looking for transactions in the public mempool. These miners first verify the signature of each and every transaction before picking it up for execution.\n\nThe process of signing every transaction have the following problems:\n\n1. A single way to verify a transaction’s authenticity. If this is compromised, the whole blockchain is compromised.\n2. A single point of failure, your private key/mnemonic. Once this is compromised, all your funds are compromised\n3. Stuck with the blockchain’s native token for everything we need to do on the blockchain.\n\nLet's dive into each one of the above-listed problems in detail.\n\n**A single way to verify a transaction’s authenticity**\n\nOne of the biggest problems with the currect architecture of Ethereum is that there is only a single way to verify a transaction’s authenticity. All transactions must be signed with an ECDSA to prove their authenticity. What if we get some vulnerability in the current algorithm (ECDSA) in the future? What about quantum computers, we know [quantum computers are coming and can break ECDSA](https://pqcrypto.org/index.html).\n\nThe problem is that if we ever have to change the algorithm to authorize transactions in the future, we will have to send an update to all the ETH nodes. For context, the current process of pushing updates to ETH nodes is through voting. The majority of the nodes have to vote in favour and pass the change. Once voted on, the change has to be planned and rolled out with proper tests. What if this takes 6 months? If there was a vulnerability in our authorization layer then all our accounts will be exposed to attacks & hacks until the change has been passed, tested & deployed to all the eth nodes.\n\n**A single point of failure, your private key/mnemonic**\n\nAnother problem in the current architecture is the single point of failure, i.e EOAs. You get a mnemonic when you create your account. That mnemonic is the access to all your crypto funds forever. There is no way to change the mnemonic, what if you forget the mnemonic? The funds are lost forever!! What if someone steals your mnemonic?? Well, write a script to transfer all your funds ASAP! (ps: the hacker already has that script and your funds are already gone). You see the problem, everything boils down to your mnemonic. Once your mnemonic is compromised, your funds are not secure anymore.\n\n**Stuck with the blockchain’s native token**\n\nThe current consensus layer also forces everyone to pay gas fees in ETH. While I love ETH & would love to hodl it for long. I would want some predictability in my wallet & have most of my liquid funds in some sort of stablecoins. There is no way for me to pay gas fees in stable coins with EOAs. The flexibility of paying fees in any other coin or method except for the native blockchain coin is impossible. This inflexibility will lead to problems in scaling Ethereum to billions of people.\n\n> ### What is account abstraction?\n\nAccount abstraction is an initiative toward solving the above problems. The latest initiative is drafted in [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). The protocol allows users to have smart contract wallets without any change to the current consensus layer. This will allow users to have their preferred way of authenticity, allow users to recover or change their proof of authenticity, and also allow users to pay gas or let others pay gas on their behalf.\n\n> **How account abstraction works?**\n\nAfter multiple attempts from the Eth community, they have settled on [EIP 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). This protocol was the preferred choice because it did not need any change to the current consensus layer.\n\nI will try and briefly explain how this EIP works and how it will abstract accounts for us. Let us first list down the components of this EIP:\n\n1. User operation\n2. Bundlers\n3. Entry Point Contract (EPC)\n4. Wallet Contract\n5. Paymaster Contract\n\n**The journey**\n\nThe journey starts with a user’s intention to execute an operation on the chain. The user then will bundle their intention of the execution in an object called, User Operation. A user operation describes the following\n\n1. User’s execution code\n2. User’s operation’s authenticity proof\n3. Wallet creation code if the wallet doesn’t exist on the chain as of now\n4. The max amount of gas that is allowed to be exhausted for the operation\n5. Paymaster information, a paymaster is a contract that is ready to pay the gas fee instead of the user for the above-stated operation\n\nWhat is the difference between a transaction versus a user operation? Transactions are fully signed (according to ECDSA) instructions from the account (EOA). While user operations are not signed but do contain proof of their authenticity & instructions that are to be executed. The proof though may not be according to ECDSA standards. The proof’s authenticity has to be decided by the smart contract wallet where the account is hosted and the consensus layer has no say on the user operation’s proof.\n\nOnce the user has created the User Operation, they send it to the public network for Bundlers to pick this operation & execute it on the chain. Bundlers are nodes who are ready to process these user operations. Bundlers can sort these user operations based on their gas fees and the reward they can earn by processing the operation successfully.\n\nHow are bundlers different from miners? Miners pick transactions that reward them and execute them, while bundlers pick user operations that reward them and execute them. In theory, a miner could become a bundler as well. But before Account Abstraction becomes mainstream, we expect there to be a smaller set of bundlers in the ecosystem than miners.\n\nBundlers then route each and every user’s operations through an Entry Point Contract. The role of the Entry Point Contract is to route the user operation through its wallet’s smart contract and get it authenticated from the contract. Along with the operation’s authenticity, the Entry Point contract also verifies if the wallet has enough balance to pay for the gas fees & reward for the bundler.\n\nIf the wallet’s contract is not deployed Entry Point will also deploy the wallet and then verify the operation.\n\nOnce the operation is verified, it will also verify the paymaster (if specified) & verify if the paymaster has enough balance to pay for the user’s operation.\n\nIn the above verification process itself, either the wallet or the paymaster has to transfer the maximum amount of gas required for the successful execution of the operation.\n\nComing back to our verification, upon successful verification of operation & paymaster, the Entry Point will then pass the complete user operation to the Wallet contract for it to execute.\n\nPost the execution of the operation, Entry Point will refund the extra unutilized gas left back to the wallet/paymaster (depending on who paid earlier). If a paymaster was involved Entry Point will also call its *postOp* function to inform it about the exact amount of gas used for this operation. This will allow the paymaster to keep a track of the payments it is sponsoring.\n\nThis is how we will be able to in future solve the three problems stated above. The architecture allows users to\n\n1. Have multiple ways to verify a transaction’s authenticity.\n2. Generate a new signature & discard the old one.\n3. Stop any transactions from their wallet if their signature has been compromised.\n4. Transfer funds to their nominees in case of the death of the owner of the wallet.\n5. Pay gas fees in a token different from ETH.\n6. A gasless experience if another party (paymaster) is ready to sponsor their transactions.\n\nI did not get a lot of time to go in deep into each and every component of the EIP. Keep an eye out for future blogs for them. I will also be writing soon about how the complete system is secure and DDOS proof!\n\nUntil then, WAGMI!", "timestamp": 1658413130, "digest": "g9Ur4lRPCMq31keyi1CyzZ7okFCZnZCABxtyX6tr9Mo", "contributor": "0x6C2265693900a68b9c9CBE2d6Eae3bd9336060db"}

You can read an aggregated overview of insights across all of these projects here.*\n\n## PartyBid / PartyDAO: Community Synopsis\n\n### decentralization spectrum:\n\nFully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.partybid.app/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### how it started: Ship First, Build Second\n\nIt started with [a single Tweet](https://party.mirror.xyz/NHMOTjy3j3EB21GTpWYH3CrMFD2k4WKTB3EpM1dkACc). On April 16, 2021, Denis Nazarov mused aloud on Twitter about a product for collective bidding on NFT auctions. He named it PartyBid. This seed of an idea inspired a builder, Anish Agnihotri, who announced just four days later ([also on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1384372491053846531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1384372491053846531%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd.mirror.xyz%2FFLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4)) that he’d built an MVP over the weekend. Less than two weeks from that initial Tweet, even more good news rolled in: PartyBid [deployed (and won)](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) their first auction.\n\n![The Tweet that started it all: https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1383238473767813125](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HiFoxMnBiT_p5f4Uwci8g.png?height=1278&width=1056)\n\nSpurred by this upstart momentum – Denis chimed back in again, [this time with a proposal on his own platform, Mirror,](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) about how a continuation of the project could play out in the form of a DAO. In that initial post, Denis laid out some early thoughts on how the economics of the $PARTY crowdfund could play out, and some of the opportunities in the long term. That was it. The rest was left up to the people, the token holders, and the DAO to decide.\n\nJust over three months later, on August 4, 2021, PartyBid v1 was live. And things moved quickly. As the team noted [in this blog post from August 2021](https://party.mirror.xyz/NHMOTjy3j3EB21GTpWYH3CrMFD2k4WKTB3EpM1dkACc), “in its first 48 hours live, PartyBid processed over 1200 ETH in volume and earned over 60 ETH.” By the end of August, over 2600 ETH had been contributed to Parties. With Ether valued at around $3,100 at the time, that meant that the equivalent of over $8 Million flowed through the platform in less than one month.\n\n### how it’s going: \n\nWhile PartyDAO is a fully decentralized organization by many definitions (read: there’s no CEO or central authority, the DAO votes on treasury decisions and product changes, and there is no central legal entity), it’s not a complete anarchy, either.\n\nDespite a Discord of 2,600+ people, Danny Aranda, one of the core contributors, estimated that about 150 people are actively engaged in their ecosystem today (which includes builders, founders, and engineers). Those contributors can still earn $PARTY for doing work and include a lot of part-time contributors for specific projects. If you want to join and contribute today, the process is really quite simple: Join the Discord, start doing tasks, get paid to do part-time work, and ultimately, potentially join their small core team of full-time workers.\n\nIn addition to the initial attention spike that brought a lot of talented contributors their way, PartyDAO has maintained a group of high-quality contributors through its [public Notion page of how to get involved](https://partydao.notion.site/partydao/Join-PartyDAO-as-a-Contributor-6400211b6c2843998e22d8ba465b82b0), not to mention its [open Github repos](https://github.com/PartyDAO/). For many of the PartyDAO contributors and advocates I spoke with, it all comes down to the strength of the team and the people working on the project. As Danny said, *\"Good software is built by dedicated people working on it in a tightly coordinated way.”* \n\n### why it worked:\n\nAt its inception, PartyBid had two major things going for it: An innovative idea and amplification from a trusted, crypto-native expert. In that sense, it was special from the start. Let’s not kid ourselves: Not everyone can Tweet out an idea on a Friday that leads to someone else building it by Monday. But this infectious energy of people wanting to roll up their sleeves and play in the sandbox with strangers was the precise seed needed to germinate an engaged, highly active community.\n\nWhen Danny spoke with me about the early days, he shared how even his own involvement started pretty casually. \n\n> *\"I was a DAO member like anyone else. I started working on the project pretty organically and unpaid. Eventually there was a governance proposal that we should start paying Danny. Then there was more work, and I started getting paid full time.\"*\n\nI suspect a similar version of this story is true for many of the core team members [named in that blog post](https://party.mirror.xyz/saJSzUTi-pkC_Soxxo5SuIVyAm05orTrgZhE0aHa2fc): Get to work, then figure out how to (maybe) get paid for that work.\n\n### how decisions get made:\n\n* full-time core team: hiring decisions, high-level strategy\n* DAO vote (via Snapshot): treasury decisions, sprints, fundraises, product fees, token supply & economics\n\n### top 3 web3 vibes:\n\n1. Viral early traction (largely driven through team)\n2. Enticing work (that attracts builders)\n3. Accessibility (to developers, through open documentation & public repos)\n\n### advice to other web3 founders & builders:\n\n> *\"I would encourage people to be really honest about what they are doing with their product and just stay true to that. Think very honestly about what your product needs. It should be very focused. Have your growth & community efforts be focused on that.\"*\n>\n> * [Danny Aranda,](https://twitter.com/daranda) Core Contributor\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1658413439, "digest": "RH6Om7e8tPclKRmb4k92OP9eNO_Gj8x8megkDqBcHK0", "contributor": "0xE8eEf01F7ac236FCeFb3260f445a006F5658054C"}

[You can read an aggregated overview of insights across all of these projects here.](https://mirror.xyz/bethanymarz.eth/AaD1J972TKT9xhzSNVFH7hCgfucB5BiQp4nWPwfyYho)*\n\n## PartyBid / PartyDAO: Community Synopsis\n\n### decentralization spectrum:\n\nFully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.partybid.app/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### how it started: Ship First, Build Second\n\nIt started with [a single Tweet](https://party.mirror.xyz/NHMOTjy3j3EB21GTpWYH3CrMFD2k4WKTB3EpM1dkACc). On April 16, 2021, Denis Nazarov mused aloud on Twitter about a product for collective bidding on NFT auctions. He named it PartyBid. This seed of an idea inspired a builder, Anish Agnihotri, who announced just four days later ([also on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1384372491053846531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1384372491053846531%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd.mirror.xyz%2FFLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4)) that he’d built an MVP over the weekend. Less than two weeks from that initial Tweet, even more good news rolled in: PartyBid [deployed (and won)](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) their first auction.\n\n![The Tweet that started it all: https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1383238473767813125](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HiFoxMnBiT_p5f4Uwci8g.png?height=1278&width=1056)\n\nSpurred by this upstart momentum – Denis chimed back in again, [this time with a proposal on his own platform, Mirror,](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) about how a continuation of the project could play out in the form of a DAO. In that initial post, Denis laid out some early thoughts on how the economics of the $PARTY crowdfund could play out, and some of the opportunities in the long term. That was it. The rest was left up to the people, the token holders, and the DAO to decide.\n\nJust over three months later, on August 4, 2021, PartyBid v1 was live. And things moved quickly. As the team noted [in this blog post from August 2021](https://party.mirror.xyz/NHMOTjy3j3EB21GTpWYH3CrMFD2k4WKTB3EpM1dkACc), “in its first 48 hours live, PartyBid processed over 1200 ETH in volume and earned over 60 ETH.” By the end of August, over 2600 ETH had been contributed to Parties. With Ether valued at around $3,100 at the time, that meant that the equivalent of over $8 Million flowed through the platform in less than one month.\n\n### how it’s going:\n\nWhile PartyDAO is a fully decentralized organization by many definitions (read: there’s no CEO or central authority, the DAO votes on treasury decisions and product changes, and there is no central legal entity), it’s not a complete anarchy, either.\n\nDespite a Discord of 2,600+ people, Danny Aranda, one of the core contributors, estimated that about 150 people are actively engaged in their ecosystem today (which includes builders, founders, and engineers). Those contributors can still earn $PARTY for doing work and include a lot of part-time contributors for specific projects. If you want to join and contribute today, the process is really quite simple: Join the Discord, start doing tasks, get paid to do part-time work, and ultimately, potentially join their small core team of full-time workers.\n\nIn addition to the initial attention spike that brought a lot of talented contributors their way, PartyDAO has maintained a group of high-quality contributors through its [public Notion page of how to get involved](https://partydao.notion.site/partydao/Join-PartyDAO-as-a-Contributor-6400211b6c2843998e22d8ba465b82b0), not to mention its [open Github repos](https://github.com/PartyDAO/). For many of the PartyDAO contributors and advocates I spoke with, it all comes down to the strength of the team and the people working on the project. As Danny said, *\"Good software is built by dedicated people working on it in a tightly coordinated way.”*\n\n### why it worked:\n\nAt its inception, PartyBid had two major things going for it: An innovative idea and amplification from a trusted, crypto-native expert. In that sense, it was special from the start. Let’s not kid ourselves: Not everyone can Tweet out an idea on a Friday that leads to someone else building it by Monday. But this infectious energy of people wanting to roll up their sleeves and play in the sandbox with strangers was the precise seed needed to germinate an engaged, highly active community.\n\nWhen Danny spoke with me about the early days, he shared how even his own involvement started pretty casually.\n\n> *\"I was a DAO member like anyone else. I started working on the project pretty organically and unpaid. Eventually there was a governance proposal that we should start paying Danny. Then there was more work, and I started getting paid full time.\"*\n\nI suspect a similar version of this story is true for many of the core team members [named in that blog post](https://party.mirror.xyz/saJSzUTi-pkC_Soxxo5SuIVyAm05orTrgZhE0aHa2fc): Get to work, then figure out how to (maybe) get paid for that work.\n\n### how decisions get made:\n\n* full-time core team: hiring decisions, high-level strategy\n* DAO vote (via Snapshot): treasury decisions, sprints, fundraises, product fees, token supply & economics\n\n### top 3 web3 vibes:\n\n1. Viral early traction (largely driven through team)\n2. Enticing work (that attracts builders)\n3. Accessibility (to developers, through open documentation & public repos)\n\n### advice to other web3 founders & builders:\n\n> *\"I would encourage people to be really honest about what they are doing with their product and just stay true to that.

In a crypto-native, [ownership-first era](https://variant.fund/writing/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software), users are opting to spend their time in digital places that offer not just a better user experience, but more autonomy and influence, more economic incentives, more connection, and ultimately, more fun.\n\nAs a result, from the moment a new crypto-native project idea takes hold, questions of community emerge almost immediately. It begs the question: ***“As a founder or builder in web3, what do you need to know about integrating community into your project? And what does this look like in a decentralized way?”***\n\nPrior to 2020, I’d spent a lot of time analyzing the ins and outs of centralized community-building best practices, largely from the examples of successful web2 networks that I got to know as a user (Foursquare, Meetup, Twitter), as an employee (Stack Overflow), or through osmosis during my time at Union Square Ventures. Last fall, I synthesized many of my [web2 community-building observations into a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HG21WQJ1J7WzfaRuaLOhbKOKiGLAoeUZ5mY8jS6V9PE/edit#slide=id.p) that drew a few parallels (and a lot of open-ended questions) about what those lessons might mean in a web3 world.\n\nBut when I started working a little more closely with a web3 builder community, called [Zeitgeist](https://mirror.xyz/zeitgeistxyz.eth), I realized that the questions founders were asking were much more acute.\n\n1. **How do we get started?**\n2. **How do we decentralize how work gets done?**\n3. **How do we convert people from awareness to participants to builders?**\n4. **How do we measure success?**\n\nTo address these questions, I began to explore the best practices from a wide range of decentralized projects, ranging from NFT networks and crowd-funding platforms to games and DeFi. **The goal of this post is to distill this research into key insights, with a target audience of both web3 builders and crypto-curious entrepreneurs.**\n\n## \\[the projects\\]\n\nDrawing on advice from community members in many of these spaces, I explored 12 projects, with an eye toward better understanding best practices among crypto-native communities. While I conducted much of the primary research independently, I also spoke with a core contributor at many of these initiatives to validate some of my findings and fill in some blanks.\n\nThey are:\n\n### Crowd-funding DAOs:\n\n* **[PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/)**[ ](https://www.partybid.app/)\n  **Protocol for buying NFTs as a team**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.partybid.app/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n  *[\\[Read the full writeup\\]](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/edit/WKzmZICjcIowNpC7JNICfZJdxhLwC_wn1d8RwPxRK-A)*\n* **[Juicebox](https://www.juicebox.money/)\n  Decentralized funding platform**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.juicebox.money/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/)\n  A community of remote cabins for independent online creators**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### DeFi:\n\n* **[Index Coop](https://indexcoop.com/)**\n  **Decentralized investment vehicles for access to crypto tokens**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://indexcoop.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)\n  Decentralized crypto trading protocol**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://uniswap.org/) ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### Gaming:\n\n* **[Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/)\n  Decentralized world-building game**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://indexcoop.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/)\n  Adventure gear stored on-chain as NFTs**\n  Fully Decentralized [⬤](https://www.lootproject.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### NFTs:\n\n* **[Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/)**[\n  ](https://nouns.wtf/)**Creative commons community of on-chain avatars**\n  Fully Decentralized [⬤](https://nouns.wtf/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Crypto Coven](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/)**[\n  ](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/)**Femme-focused crypto community of Witches**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/) ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### Other Applications:\n\n* **[Helium](https://www.helium.com/)**[\n  ](https://www.helium.com/)**Decentralized wireless infrastructure**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://www.helium.com/) ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)**[ ](https://mirror.xyz/)\n\n  **Decentralized, on-chain platform for publishing & funding**\n\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://mirror.xyz/) ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Numerai](https://numer.ai/)\n  Decentralized hedge fund built upon a data science tournament**Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://numer.ai/) ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n*\\*If you’re totally new to the space, read these primers first on [DAOs](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-a-dao-and-how-do-they-work/), [DeFi](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/), [NFTs](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq), and [decentralized gaming](https://blog.duelistking.com/explaining-the-concept-of-decentralized-gaming-dfc14fb52b77).*\n\n## \\[the research\\]\n\n**The primary output of this work includes three components:**\n\n1. **This overview** of best practices for web3 founders & builders to keep in mind when asking the question, \\*“How do I build a decentralized community into my product?”\n2. **A series of 12 discrete stories,** one for each project I explored, to walk through the timeline of how things got started and where they stand as of today (July 2022).I’ll be dropping these out through my Mirror here for the next month.

(via https://www.creatorcabins.com/visit)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-z91ofHoIiit1YN1r9_WC.png?height=668&width=1764&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nPerhaps the most frequent question I get asked about community-building is also the simplest: *How do you start?* But the problem with asking people about how they got started is that these stories quickly become part of the romanticized folklore of any startup founding experience. Throughout this research, I did my best to unfurl each project to its starting kernel. Here are the web3 specific nuances and observations that emerged:\n\n### Build first. Strategize second.\n\nOne of the strongest tenets of web3 (or at least the phase of the adoption curve we find ourselves in today) is a culture of building *before* planning. John at CabinDAO quite literally built cabins without knowing how he wanted to use them. A builder saw a [Tweet containing an idea for a new app called “Partybid”](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1383238473767813125?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1383238473767813125%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd.mirror.xyz%2FFLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) and [decided to spend his weekend coding up a v1](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1384372491053846531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1384372491053846531%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd.mirror.xyz%2FFLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4). There’s an authenticity in doing something “just because” that gives credence to these early cycles.\\*\\*\n\nThis *“don’t think, just do”* approach seems to be particularly true among some of the standout DAOs that began on pure adrenaline and “good vibes.” I’m thinking in particular of SharkDAO, which started with the idea that people wanted to collectively bid on Nouns NFTs, and ConstitutionDAO, which spun up (and spun down) in a single week in their quest to purchase a copy of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAmusingly, in this [Verge article about the ConstitutionDAO](https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution), the journalist kept pushing on what was going to happen *after* they bought the U.S. Constitution, asking pragmatic questions like: *“Where would it reside? Who would take care of it?”* The reality is: That wasn’t *really* the point. At least, not right away. The most innovative projects I’ve gotten to know in web3 didn’t start with strategy – they started with *possibility*.\n\n### Sell the dream.\n\nNo matter how crypto-native and digital-first your project may be, your end users are still human (even if they embrace pfps and pseudonyms), and the quickest projects to gain traction are ones that lean into basic human psychology. I noticed four key motivators that galvanized people to jump on board with a new project or initiative. (Which, notably have clear parallels with some of the early traction moments in the world of web2.)\n\n1. **“You’ll be the first.”**\n\n   As one of the first DeFi projects to DAO-ify, [Index Coop](https://indexcoop.com/) fully [decentralized their governance](https://medium.com/indexcoop/introducing-the-index-cooperative-a4eaaf0bcfe2) at a time when the rest of us were still trying to remember what that three-letter acronym stood for. As a result, in addition to unlocking a network of early DeFi evangelists, they also attracted best-in-class community builders, who quite literally quit their day jobs to come up with [guiding principles](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coops-guiding-principles/346) and [new org design concepts](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coop-org-chart/1462) to experiment with a brand new way of working and collaborating. There’s a real benefit to the first-mover advantage.\n2. **“You’ll join an incredible community (of builders).”**\n\n   This is no secret to web3, but it bears repeating: People want to work with great people. Period. Today this largely manifests as developers wanting to build together – which is a large part of the driving action behind the strength of the contributor communities behind Juicebox and PartyBid, or why securing a place on the [Dark Forest leaderboard](https://zkga.me/) holds the equivalent of [Stack Overflow reputation points](https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation) in a web3 era. One of Juicebox’s core contributors, [Jango](https://twitter.com/me_jango), put it best – [“devs like to dev with other devs.”](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/year-of-the-dev/)\n\n   But it’s also apparent in non-developer networks such as CabinDAO, Crypto Coven, and Mirror. In particular, Mirror’s innovative approach to bootstrapping community through the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) brought in high-quality new writers at a manageable, consistent pace. In fact, *every single web3 community* I explored referred to the caliber of the people in their network. Figure out what “that special thing” is for your community, and harness it to attract more like-minded community members.\n3. **“You’ll push the boundaries of what’s possible.”**\n\n   In one of the more clever twists of incentive structure that meets organizational objectives, the game [Dark Forest](https://blog.zkga.me/) was literally built to be broken. The only way to win this world-building and planet-claiming on-chain game is to code your way through automations to streamline your gameplay experience. The foundation that funds the game (among other projects), [0xPARC](https://0xparc.org/about), has a mission to promote application-level innovation on Ethereum. Their open approach to competitive game design has attracted some of the most serious Solidity developers as game players, all excited about the opportunity to push the limits of their code.\n4. **You’ll make money.**\n\n   I’ll spare you the full-on “gold rush” analogy, but you can’t deny the power of the potential upside. In an ownership-first platform, incentives are more important than ever – the trick is getting the balance right. While you don’t need to look far to see how NFT projects drive in “community” through price-gouging, rug pulls, and other cheap tricks, examples of utility-based incentives are much more compelling in the long term. Uniswap’s [model for liquidity providers (now in v3)](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5391541-provide-liquidity-on-uniswap-v3) is a continual iterative effort to educate, incentivize, and empower this core audience segment to their platform. Numerai, which incentivizes data scientists to contribute successful models to their [decentralized hedge fund](https://numer.ai/), amended their incentive structure to reward contributions to their meta model vs. based on individual payouts. The most important advice I received here was simple: Your incentive design must be based around the type of engagement you want. (Easier said than done.)\n\n![Making the “top 10” on the leaderboard for the game, Dark Forest, is just about one of the highest honors you can achieve as a Solidity developer today. (via: https://zkga.me/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kcDA98wo48aG4xtVekWD0.png?height=1228&width=1008)\n\n### Your core team (still) matters more than ever.\n\nWhether you call them founders, builders, or core contributors, the sentiment remains the same. Four of the projects I analyzed can attribute at least part of their initial traction phase to the fact that their core team was previously known or trusted in the space. Like it or not, people with an audience and brand are more likely to galvanize community and early traction.\n\nSee: [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/), started by [Dom](https://twitter.com/dhof), creator of Vine, and [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/), whose core team of Nounders not only also included Dom but other heavy-hitters like the artist [@gremplin](https://twitter.com/gremplin) and [@punk4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156), a prominent thinker and investor. Just like in other industries, smart people tend to pop up again in other smart projects. The more people and projects I spent time with, the more I found intersections and cross-project participation as the norm. Look no further than [Partybid](https://www.partybid.app/)’s origin story, which [literally began as an idea in a single tweet](https://party.mirror.xyz/NHMOTjy3j3EB21GTpWYH3CrMFD2k4WKTB3EpM1dkACc) from Denis Nazarov, former founder and [a16z](https://a16z.com/) crypto partner – not to mention the founder of [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), another successful web3 project. One other big benefit of trusted early builders? It’s a surefire way of guaranteeing that the [“first follower” effect](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbooksauthors/2018/04/11/the-forgotten-first-follower/) attracts a high-caliber network of secondary builders and contributors.\n\n**BEWARE OF: Speculation & Frenzy**\n\nNearly everyone in web3 knows someone who made the right move at the right time and walked away with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of dollars in the bank. Even among the most well-intentioned of projects, you may end up with YouTubers talking about how [Helium is a “magic box to earn you thousands of dollars”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KG-5SnXCTA) or that Loot bags containing Divine Robes [merit selling for as much as 250 ETH](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xff9c1b15b16263c61d017ee9f65c50e4ae0113d7/748). But the spikey viral peaks of growth (and people seeking profits) actually dilute the community. It can be hard to avoid but still noteworthy to mention. [Optimism’s airdrop earlier this year](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/) serves as an early example of a project at staving off arbitrage efforts, but there’s still work to be done. There’s something to be said for the bear market we’re in: Despite people objectively losing money, it does provide an opportunity for building over speculation.\n\n## \\[2: decentralizing how work gets done\\]\n\n![Protocol improvement proposals, a process for suggesting changes to the platform or project, are often voted upon in Snapshot, as is the case with Uniswap’s governance process. (via https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6jshYP1cw5vcJf4ahSOOw.png?height=1322&width=2144&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nOnce you’ve started a web3 community, you’ll probably start wondering how much to empower the community – both in decision-making and how that work is executed. While most web3 projects look at *how decisions get made* as the determining factor around its state of decentralization, an [emergent theory from Spencer Graham](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/tGT32p-lA__63rmTXq_OD_iTTDoK-vsUn3QVsnnWmvo) suggests that the purest form should include both decentralized decision-making *and* decentralized execution. In other words: ***“How ‘decentralized’ are you, really?”***\n\nThroughout my research, I’ve ranked each project against a 5-point scale – *the “decentralization spectrum” –* ranging from fully decentralized to fully centralized.\n\n### Decentralization Spectrum\n\nFully Decentralized **⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AQNhAAeQ2o86-bNcGpHwEiJiyeMqhVa0onUZBMxPNaw/edit#slide=id.p) ⬤ ⬤** Fully Centralized\n\nYou’ll notice that, at least among this subset of arguably well-known projects, “pure decentralization” (all decisions & actions are taken in a decentralized way) is the outlier, not the norm. And very few start as fully decentralized, with the exception of Bitcoin itself, and possibly also Loot. The vast majority fall somewhere in the middle.\n\n![The Decentralization Spectrum is a 5-point scale approximation of the relative level of decentralization for any project, based on how decisions and work is accomplished.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pZxLlcQ3ZTZ6lwF_Lfl02.png?height=540&width=960)\n\n### Share transparent and public documentation.\n\nIt’s no secret that web3 projects build in public. With open Discord servers, Twitter threads, public-facing governance forums, and voting through Snapshot, nearly every project has a wide degree of open, transparent documentation to their users and community.\n\n**But – Just because something exists on the open web does *not* mean it is equally accessible to all.** I first started this project intending to do wholly independent solo research into each web3 community. But I quickly discovered this was not sustainable. As a newcomer to all of these spaces, it took me *hours* of time to untangle the [sometimes cryptic websites](https://zkga.me/), dozens of pages of documentation, and decipher the meaning behind each Discord server’s channel names.\n\nIn web2, we attributed broad developer adoption of new technology due in part to a product’s ease of API access and documentation. In web3, we look at their Notion pages, Discord groups, and onboarding flow. A couple of examples stand out here right away in terms of their level of accessibility and robustness of their materials: Index Coop, both in terms of its [new member onboarding](https://onboarding.catapultlabs.xyz/indexcoop) and [handbook](https://docs.indexcoop.com/); and Juicebox for their [Notion](https://info.juicebox.money/), built with both project creators and developers in mind. An honorable mention goes to NFT project Crypto Coven for their [community-generated public Library](https://cryptocoven.notion.site/cryptocoven/98e0b55d3c2c415bb0bdbb78f68be4a0?v=8f8de19db6484e4b85727c4ef1a5c925), which aggregates both stories of the “lore” surrounding their network and also the basics of DAOs and web3.\n\n![Index Coop’s public community handbook is among the most well-documented and transparent projects for their existing and prospective community members. (via: https://docs.indexcoop.com/) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I0XjJVI2HNx-COhFrl-rM.png?height=1224&width=2536)\n\n### Give your community a voice separate from the core build.\n\nPerhaps one of the most noteworthy trends in decentralized community management is the separation of the community’s influence from that of the core builders. Helium and Uniswap offered the strongest examples of this “church and state” effect in their decision-making frameworks. Both are equipped with a C-corp of core builders and team members and also a non-profit entity (or foundation), which is community-managed.\n\nIn Uniswap’s case, their core team Uniswap Labs owns the product (which includes the web app interface, the widget, and any other products they may roll out), but Uniswap the DAO owns the protocol. Decisions about the protocol are managed through a foundation and government through their open [governance proposal process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732). As one example of how this plays out, the recent decision to deploy v3 of Uniswap can be tracked all the way back to conversations that began in March and followed the four steps in their governance: a [Temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-uniswap-x-celo-green-pool-for-treasury-proposal/16428), a [Consensus check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-uniswap-x-celo-green-pool-for-treasury-proposal/16458), and a [Governance proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-celo/16686), ultimately leading to the [successful deployment](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-v3-deployed-on-celo/17091) on July 13.\n\nHelium is one of many projects that leverages a proposal process to manage requested changes to their protocol, called [HIPs](https://github.com/helium/HIP). (Other examples include [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://eips.ethereum.org/)” (EIPs), and similar processes at [Zcash](https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/main/zip-0000.rst) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).) Managed through Github, these changes are then routed to the core team at Helium, Inc., where most of the core devs of the Helium blockchain are employed. Both of these examples strike a mid-point balance of how to both leverage community engagement and recommendations while still allowing some degree of agility and nimble-ness from a core team.\n\n### Start with an incomplete build.\n\nOne interesting tendency among some web3 projects is to intentionally start with “incomplete builds.” A deck of Loot bags dropping as an NFT collection inspired dozens of side projects, teams, and builders to corral around the “player’s deck” and build out the world with additional elements: [Maps](https://opensea.io/collection/crypts-and-caverns), [Realms](https://scroll.bibliothecadao.xyz/docs/game/realms), [HyperLoot Characters](https://hyperlootproject.com/). A 100% creative commons collection of NFTs called Nouns beacons a new wave of [designers](https://nounstown.wtf/), [animators](https://hackmd.io/@elrgoLkbTcaX3edoqOHuQQ/nouns-the-animated-series), and [storytellers](https://nouns.wtf/vote/83) to contribute to this emergent ecosystem. Dark Forest’s decentralized world-building game was made to be exploited – actively encouraging developers to build plug-ins, integrations, and other boundary-pushing gameplay tactics – even when this sometimes meant [acknowledging when things went a little too far](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1510658041473024010). Each of these projects, and many more in the space, serve as magnets in the way they playfulness and collaboration from a community that not only decides what comes next, but also builds it themselves.\n\nIn each of these examples (arguably the most truly decentralized projects I explored), getting the starting conditions right is more important than ever. [Sina Habibian](https://twitter.com/sinahab) who advises web3 builders in the community Zeitgeist said:\n\n> *“I think being thoughtful/intentional about the initial conditions actually matters more when launching a truly decentralized project (like Loot and Nouns). That's because the core team (if a core team even exists) can't course correct as easily after the fact. There is a strong inertia to the initial choices that influences the direction the community/project evolves.”*\n\n![Loot bags, which you can buy on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, simply contain eight lines of text with randomized items, objects, and gear. What becomes of these “trading cards” is up to the community to decide. (via: https://opensea.io/collection/lootproject)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EFSHPVSzFcIMxSjz2j3Te.png?height=880&width=1862)\n\n### Consider an intermediate layer of community leadership\n\nNearly every DAO I spoke with had some additional layer of community leadership to help manage their broader network. While the obvious thought may be to simply assign Discord permissions to server members who step up, authentic design for community ambassador programs stems much more organically. Index Coop uses something called “Owl Levels” to designate different levels of seniority in the community (Gold, Silver and Bronze, each with a vote weighting around them). Numerai elected a “Council of Elders” of senior community members who could make decisions more quickly on behalf of the broader network. Creator Cabins has a “City Council” composed of people with at least 500 $CABIN. These designations seem to serve as an extension from common web2 community-building models such as “developer evangelists,” “influencers,” or even just “brand ambassadors” in that they harbor not only titles and perks, but also some influence and authority.\n\n**BEWARE OF: The temptation to turn everything into a community vote.**\n\nProlific web3 community thought leader, [@rafathebuilder](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder), who has engaged in communities including Creator Cabins and Mirror observed:\n\n> *\"I think there’s a thing of “minimum required decentralization” — there are real trade-offs. Many organizations need to sacrifice efficiency and build decentralization through slow, organic growth. If you’re aiming for decentralization, you’re not aiming to make it cheap. You’re not optimizing on cost to production, you’re optimizing on the resiliency of the network.\"*\n\nOne of the most thoughtful essays I read on this topic came from Jon Hills at CabinDAO: *[How Decentralized Organizations Win (And Lose).](https://creators.mirror.xyz/6-iNptibzKNrQaZJR_ufiMkLQvj5mgpFYueWFKu9agU)* In this piece, Jon challenges the notion of “decentralized absolutism” and identifies principles from four (non-crypto-native) organizations that flexibly adapt around the needs of their community, without offering 100% of the power to the people. This tension is one that many crypto-native builders will need to reconcile with among their own projects and protocols – both the opportunities and challenges involved.\n\n## \\[3: converting people into participants into builders\\]\n\n![Despite the digital-first nature of web3, community is core to the ethos of builders in the space; at the Devconnect conference in Amsterdam earlier this year, a pop-up coworking space accommodated 500+ people at once. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fFvx0foJhuJDJz-uxaJ3W.png?height=3024&width=4032&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nIn an ownership economy, the active participation of members in web3 communities matters as much as users matter in web2. Many builders and founders are asking: **“What’s the web3 conversion funnel? How do I get people to go from an idle observer to a community member to an active participant in my project?”** While there’s no magic wand answer to this question (just as there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to classic marketing funnel activities in web2), here are a few observations (and one misconception) I observed from the projects in my research.\n\n### Know who your audience is (and who it isn’t).\n\nThe strongest web3 communities I encountered had absolutely no qualms about acknowledging who exactly they were targeting. Crypto Coven perhaps nails this most of all – going after “femme” culture in web3 and positioning themselves as the “anti crypto bro” culture. From the moment you [land on their website](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/), you’re transported into a different place – one of witchy language, folklore, premonitions and prophecies.\n\nWhile you might start out, as Crypto Coven’s team of “High Witches” did, intentionally targeting an audience for your project, it’s far more common for teams to discover this organically. Such was the case for Index Coop, whose audience of DeFi evangelists emerged slowly, [with each new product](https://indexcoop.com/products) that launched. With each additional product launch, a new sub-community niche emerges on Index, with each contributing in its own way to the DAO.\n\nBy contrast, Helium, a project [originally founded as an IoT company in 2013](https://blog.helium.com/welcome-to-heliums-decentralized-machine-network-2e7b0801da44), has a very high rate of brand-new-to-crypto people — for many of them, Helium is the only crypto project they’re involved in, which has influenced the flavor of community organizing in a lot of ways. These severe audience differences are also what make it impossible to define one universal approach to community.\n\n![From the second you land on Crypto Coven’s website, you know you’ve entered another world entirely. This self-selecting mechanism helps them serve as a magnet for the audience that would most align with their community. (via: https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/lore) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/On8CtKMMGb-lVAB2gk-W5.png?height=1072&width=2170)\n\n### Recognize that your most passionate community-members are willing to work for free\n\nI used to believe that most of the power in web3 existed in the inherent incentive structure for every community action taken. Whether you pick up a bounty, refer a new collaborator, or contribute in some other way, I was under the impression that all actions received some incentive or compensation as reward.\n\nBut the more I unfolded the layers of these communities that I spoke with, the more I learned that incentives are a bit of a “squishy” area – even in web3. For one, hundreds of people donated to CabinDAO’s original mission – to fund creative retreats for emerging artists – without personally benefiting from that outcome. The 17,000 people who contributed to ConstitutionDAO’s insane crowdfund campaign did so as a mere curiosity, with zero expectation of a return on that investment. But people aren’t just willing to donate money; they also donate time. Danny Aranda, now a core contributor at PartyDAO, started just as any other community participant. He said:\n\n> *\"I was a DAO member like anyone else. I started working on the project pretty organically and pretty unpaid. There was a governance proposal that we should start paying Danny, and then there was more work, and I started getting paid full time.\"*\n\nDanny’s use case is a particularly good example of how projects can assess project-market fit among their community: If people are willing to work for free (at least initially), you’ve found your hook.\n\n[In a survey of 400+ DAO members that Gitcoin conducted](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLJvPOvibcCUpJ9ES44_cdoX5Hb7LpDaloGWz5FbUEM/edit#slide=id.gea346d7c21_1_101), roughly half of respondents reported that DAOs are *not* their primary source of income. (Interestingly, this is the same percent of people who reported having at least 12 months of savings, so the relative financial security of DAO contributors may contribute toward their earnestness to take on unpaid work.) And my favorite example was learning that the [“Council of Elders”](https://twitter.com/NumeraiCoE) at Numerai also isn’t exactly paid to do that work – but the reputation of being an Elder stands on its own, and they did gift them cloaks, which the team excitedly wore in solidarity at IRL conferences together.\n\n**To be clear: I’m not suggesting that you *stop* paying your community members for their hard work and labor.** Most of these projects made it quite clear to me that there are thresholds of free work to bounty-based work and ultimately to full time, paid work. I’m simply noting that – even in the hyper-tokenized world of web3, sometimes you can get great people to do great things by just buying them some cool-looking cloaks.\n\n![Numerai consistently seeks out opportunities to reward contributors to their project in unique ways, including through this recent campaign giving away free “NFTees.” (via: https://twitter.com/NumeraiCoE/status/1547243673519214593)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6pcv3qkJ5QPFr1GZnwjrs.png?height=1202&width=1094)\n\n### Focus on a small core team of builders and a broad team of evangelists\n\nTo the outside observer, Discord server size serves as a false flag measurement of true engagement. Even for projects with Discord communities in the tens of thousands (Uniswap) or hundreds of thousands (Helium), the relative size of the contributing team is small by comparison. As a project leader, there’s a serious temptation to get sucked into the groundswell of needs, requests, ideas and suggestions from these bottomless communities. But a more disciplined, constraint-based approach to growth can help you stay focused on the North Star for your community. For most projects, the percent of community members who are also core contributors or builders is much smaller than you may think.\n\nThe best example of a strategic and intentional rollout of a product-led community strategy is through Mirror’s [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race). For more than six months, Mirror invited writers to submit content for that week’s competition, and token holders voted to admit 10 new members each week. These new members quickly became early adopters, finding kinship not only in a peer community of high-quality writers but also informing future product & protocol development for Mirror’s core team.\n\nFinally, I’ll note that some DAOs – and many NFT projects – are quick to pick out one simple, easy way for their broad base of members to serve as evangelists. This might be actively encouraging members to rock their swag ([like Bored Apes),](https://www.boredapewear.com/) funding projects that also promote brand awareness ([like Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/vote/95)) or even actively engaging on Twitter through memes and pfps. One of the main reasons that I chose Crypto Coven as an NFT project to dive into for this research was due to the intense degree of community outreach I received from the network of Witches in [my initial Twitter inquiry about community research](https://twitter.com/bethanymarz/status/1506356530614087688).\n\n![Splashy partnerships and hype installations, such as this Bored Apes inflatable as part of NFT NYC week are a popular tactic to drive brand awareness among web3 communities. (via: https://www.wsj.com/articles/marketers-at-nft-nyc-upbeat-on-brand-building-in-the-metaverse-11656324000)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PGRQr8lBFkYKgpx7r4hG0.jpeg?height=1146&width=1720)\n\n**BEWARE OF: Facilitating chatter vs. true community engagement.**\n\nIt would be a mistake to go through the motions of community, or simply follow suit to “run the playbook” of another DAO or crypto-native project. [Conway Anderson](https://twitter.com/ConwayAnderson), web3 builder and early Loot adopter has observed this in many networks he has been a part of. He said:\n\n> *“Nothing happens if you just create a Discord and put people there. Nobody really knows what they want to do. The best DAOs / products in the space have usually been a group of people who execute and through that, the broader community starts to go, “What if…?” There’s usually a certain threshold where other people start to come in.”*\n\nPart of achieving this level of engagement involves leaning into the parts of your project that are uniquely web3 – and legitimately wouldn’t be possible to build in web2 structures. Rafa noted:\n\n> *“I think that the reason why web3 feels special is because many protocols weren’t public infrastructure before web3, they were private infrastructure. It’s really hard to build a community around private infrastructure that’s more than just a “fan base” (like Apple). But it’s much harder to maintain that community when it comes to private infrastructure. Today's opportunity to unlock the power of evangelism is of a different magnitude. You have so much connectivity; you can tailor your message, do automatic translations, crowdfunds, anyone can send anyone money or pool resources together.”*\n\n## \\[4: measuring success\\]\n\n![Every community defines success differently. SharkDAO’s mission is to pool together resources to buy Nouns, and ultimately help people find their way into the Nouns NFT ecosystem. (via: https://sharks.wtf/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UXhYi3cFM5hKD7LRu116r.png?height=1064&width=1038)\n\nJust as every company carries a different definition for success, so does every community. But in this research, I encountered a few grounding principles that seemed to help some projects identify their True North, keep up the momentum, and galvanize ongoing community engagement. Here’s what that looks like in practice.\n\n### Decide whether you’re building infrastructure, or providing engagement.\n\nFirst – identify your True North Star. Some of the best advice I received during this project came from learning about [Rafa](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder)’s distinction in building infrastructure vs. engagements. In a real-world example, he challenged me to consider the way that you might cultivate community in a neighborhood. **One option is to build infrastructure – parks, churches, community centers – and let people organically self-organize. The alternative is to design activities – block parties, game nights, town meetings – and engage people around events.**\n\nAs a web3 project leader – there’s a clear choice to make. You can build a community around your protocol (such as how Helium, Mirror, and Uniswap have done), or you can offer event-based programming designed to keep your community members coming back. (The latter is not only the case for most NFT projects but also for the myriad of DAOs, learning communities, and other decentralized, member-based networks in web3 today.) While this choice isn’t necessarily a binary one, it is something you should formulate a thesis around for your particular project.\n\n### Have a bias to action.\n\nSecond – the web3 equivalent of “move fast and break things” – Say “yes” to new partnerships and opportunities. This happens in real time, all the time: A new connection at a conference becomes an NFT artist for your next project; an errant message on Twitter or Telegram blossoms into a new Discord and a game plan to bid on the U.S. Constitution with a DAO. Due to the quick cycles of experimentation and iteration necessary for this new era, saving some space to say yes to more spontaneous opportunities (and being open-minded about what those might be) is just about one of the best decisions you can make.A few examples: CabinDAO didn’t start as a DAO. Their founder Jon hosted a group of friends for a soft launch at his initial properties once they were completed, and one of the attendees spoke about the opportunity to use crypto to scale the creator co-op that they had all been working on together. Both of the early projects that gave Juicebox their initial traction came from their core contributor Jango jumping right into two fast-moving hype projects (SharkDAO and ConstitutionDAO) – volunteering their product as the means to make it possible. It matters less if you are ready: What matters is that you are there.\n\n### Invite your community to play.\n\nThird – make it irresistible to walk away. Let’s be honest: There’s a lot of “un-fun” things about the world today. It’s easy to forget how delightful it feels to have a good laugh or take on something *totally ridiculous* with strangers on the Internet. But some of the stickiest projects I encountered – the ones you can’t help but root for no matter what – are just fun, plain and simple.\n\nI’ll bet you can’t sit through 10 minutes of [“Noun’o’clock” in the Noun Square](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock) without cracking a smile. These daily Twitter spaces commentary treats the conclusion of each live NFT auction like a sporting event, complete with wacky sound effects, and witty banter as the group follows along in real time watching potential new Noun NFTs get randomly generated.\n\n(Think a bunch of people shouting at once, things like: *“This one’s a messy design but I like it.” “I like the bonsai but not with that shirt.” “The sunglasses flamingo?! Come on!” “I’m still thinking about that pineapple.”)*\n\n![Part of “Noun’o’clock” includes a social engagement tactic called “Fomo Nouns” where randomized Nouns appear (like this flamingo-headed avatar) and participants quickly vote on which one to mint. (via: https://fomonouns.wtf/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/POMIHo6rT-HoDaa2Bz5M4.png?height=1112&width=1434)\n\nWhen I attended DevConnect earlier this year, I sat down with the core contributors behind [dfdao](http://www.dfdao.xyz/), the DAO that came together to collectively compete in the game, Dark Forest. As a non-gamer, I was stuck on one question: *“Why?”* Why did you dedicate time away from your full-time jobs to compete at a world-building game with anons all over the world? Why were you compelled to make sure you had always had someone to operate as a “pilot” to execute game play around the clock, every five minutes, for a week straight?\n\nIt didn’t click until I sat through a presentation from Ivan at 0xPARC about Dark Forest. When discussing community engagement in their game, he paused to talk about how dfdao had exposed a vulnerability that let them directly target an opponent and drain all of the resources from their planet. When he showed what this looked like in the universal map ([slide 32 in his deck here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u1nBl5Lu9q24j9pX5B9fyhwNSyZGK58nVbEoe8rNJIk/edit#slide=id.g124c1af0a63_1_103)), I watched the dfdao team proudly grin at each other ear-to-ear, audibly cackling about their cheeky path to victory. That’s when it finally hit me: To them, it’s all just play. And they are having the time of their lives.\n\nThe most fun I had on the Internet last year was watching the livestream of the Sotheby’s auction for the U.S. Constitution. The chat, Discord, and Twitter were simultaneously flooded by [memes](https://twitter.com/laurenlself/status/1459341510655180803) and [inside jokes](https://twitter.com/pseudotheos/status/1461348482401255445) and [speculation](https://twitter.com/abcoathup/status/1461495987298471942). And even when we learned we lost the bid – when the stated goal of the project failed to come to pass – the community pressed on. [This interview](https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution) with Jonah Erlich, a core ConstitutionDAO contributor, highlighted it best:\n\n> ***“Do you have a sense of why people are building a secondary market for this \\[$PEOPLE\\] token?”***\n>\n> *“People like the memes.”*\\*\n>\n> **“You think that’s it?”**\n>\n> *Yeah. People like the memes; they like to have fun. I think that one thing that I’ve learned from exploring the crypto world is that it’s very hard to rationalize a lot of the different momentums — things that happen with memes and with the memetic transfer of information. I think if people are having fun and they’re doing their thing, then I don’t try to interpret it too deeply, because I’m just going to break my brain.”*\n\nSometimes, you must throw away rationality and [“seize the memes of production.”](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1434785416536854529?lang=en)\n\n![Nicholas Cage was the star of the show for much of the meme-culture that existed around the ConstitutionDAO marketing strategy.

(Except for possibly, Uniswap, which towers above the rest as the [most beloved blockchain-enabled app](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLJvPOvibcCUpJ9ES44_cdoX5Hb7LpDaloGWz5FbUEM/edit#slide=id.gea6e71d04f_0_95). That is, at least, for now.) If web2 volatility has taught us anything, it’s that the project that can’t pivot is the project that will fail. Adaptability is key to success.\n\n## \\[wrap-up\\]\n\nSuffice it to say, a lot has happened over the past two years. The bull market run-up leading up through late 2021 crowded a lot of these spaces and communities with more energy than web3 has ever seen before – and through that saturation of energy, we witnessed an immense degree of experimentation & iteration. While temperatures have cooled somewhat in the recent macroeconomic environment and slow-down, we find ourselves at an interesting inflection point, one which allows us to take stock, dig a little deeper, and catch our bearings to direct our attention in more deliberate, intentional ways for the next phase of the crypto adoption curve.\n\nAs of yet, there is still no clear-cut winner – no single company or project who has “solved” decentralization completely (if that’s even the objective). But it is exciting to see some early patterns and behaviors emerge, ones that might guide the next generation of builders and creators (maybe including you).\n\nI invite you to continue this project with me through both exploring & contributing to the library of resources I used along the way.\n\nI’ll be releasing the rest of these individual stories on a weekly cadence [here on Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/bethanymarz.eth).

{"id": "kT6ESFaZoIO4S3njQNLjZJ1HErN7SdAN-ipBBtpoeqM", "title": "What We Can Learn from Decentralized Community Building", "body": "### A distilled insights guide for web3 founders & builders\n\n## \\[intro\\]\n\nOver the past two years, we’ve witnessed a [meteoric](https://messari.io/governor/daos) [rise](https://discoverdaos.com/dao-directory) in the power of decentralized community-building. In a crypto-native, [ownership-first era](https://variant.fund/writing/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software), users are opting to spend their time in digital places that offer not just a better user experience, but more autonomy and influence, more economic incentives, more connection, and ultimately, more fun.\n\nAs a result, from the moment a new crypto-native project idea takes hold, questions of community emerge almost immediately. It begs the question: ***“As a founder or builder in web3, what do you need to know about integrating community into your project? And what does this look like in a decentralized way?”***\n\nPrior to 2020, I’d spent a lot of time analyzing the ins and outs of centralized community-building best practices, largely from the examples of successful web2 networks that I got to know as a user (Foursquare, Meetup, Twitter), as an employee (Stack Overflow), or through osmosis during my time at Union Square Ventures. Last fall, I synthesized many of my [web2 community-building observations into a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HG21WQJ1J7WzfaRuaLOhbKOKiGLAoeUZ5mY8jS6V9PE/edit#slide=id.p) that drew a few parallels (and a lot of open-ended questions) about what those lessons might mean in a web3 world.\n\nBut when I started working a little more closely with a web3 builder community, called [Zeitgeist](https://mirror.xyz/zeitgeistxyz.eth), I realized that the questions founders were asking were much more acute.\n\n1. **How do we get started?**\n2. **How do we decentralize how work gets done?**\n3. **How do we convert people from awareness to participants to builders?**\n4. **How do we measure success?**\n\nTo address these questions, I began to explore the best practices from a wide range of decentralized projects, ranging from NFT networks and crowd-funding platforms to games and DeFi. **The goal of this post is to distill this research into key insights, with a target audience of both web3 builders and crypto-curious entrepreneurs.**\n\n## \\[the projects\\]\n\nDrawing on advice from community members in many of these spaces, I explored 12 projects, with an eye toward better understanding best practices among crypto-native communities. While I conducted much of the primary research independently, I also spoke with a core contributor at many of these initiatives to validate some of my findings and fill in some blanks.\n\nThey are:\n\n### Crowd-funding DAOs:\n\n* **[PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/)**[ ](https://www.partybid.app/)\n  **Protocol for buying NFTs as a team**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.partybid.app/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n  *[\\[Read the full writeup\\]](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/edit/WKzmZICjcIowNpC7JNICfZJdxhLwC_wn1d8RwPxRK-A)*\n* **[Juicebox](https://www.juicebox.money/)\n  Decentralized funding platform**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.juicebox.money/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/)\n  A community of remote cabins for independent online creators**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### DeFi:\n\n* **[Index Coop](https://indexcoop.com/)**\n  **Decentralized investment vehicles for access to crypto tokens**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://indexcoop.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)\n  Decentralized crypto trading protocol**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://uniswap.org/) ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### Gaming:\n\n* **[Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/)\n  Decentralized world-building game**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://indexcoop.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/)\n  Adventure gear stored on-chain as NFTs**\n  Fully Decentralized [⬤](https://www.lootproject.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### NFTs:\n\n* **[Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/)**[\n  ](https://nouns.wtf/)**Creative commons community of on-chain avatars**\n  Fully Decentralized [⬤](https://nouns.wtf/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Crypto Coven](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/)**[\n  ](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/)**Femme-focused crypto community of Witches**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/) ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### Other Applications:\n\n* **[Helium](https://www.helium.com/)**[\n  ](https://www.helium.com/)**Decentralized wireless infrastructure**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://www.helium.com/) ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)**[ ](https://mirror.xyz/) \n Decentralized, on-chain platform for publishing & funding  \n Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://mirror.xyz/) ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Numerai](https://numer.ai/)\n  Decentralized hedge fund built upon a data science tournament**Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://numer.ai/) ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n*\\*If you’re totally new to the space, read these primers first on [DAOs](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-a-dao-and-how-do-they-work/), [DeFi](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/), [NFTs](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq), and [decentralized gaming](https://blog.duelistking.com/explaining-the-concept-of-decentralized-gaming-dfc14fb52b77).*\n\n## \\[the research\\]\n\n**The primary output of this work includes three components:**\n\n1. **This overview** of best practices for web3 founders & builders to keep in mind when asking the question, \\*“How do I build a decentralized community into my product?”\n2. **A series of 12 discrete stories,** one for each project I explored, to walk through the timeline of how things got started and where they stand as of today (July 2022).I’ll be dropping these out through my Mirror here for the next month.

(via https://www.creatorcabins.com/visit)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-z91ofHoIiit1YN1r9_WC.png?height=668&width=1764&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nPerhaps the most frequent question I get asked about community-building is also the simplest: *How do you start?* But the problem with asking people about how they got started is that these stories quickly become part of the romanticized folklore of any startup founding experience. Throughout this research, I did my best to unfurl each project to its starting kernel. Here are the web3 specific nuances and observations that emerged:\n\n### Build first. Strategize second.\n\nOne of the strongest tenets of web3 (or at least the phase of the adoption curve we find ourselves in today) is a culture of building *before* planning. John at CabinDAO quite literally built cabins without knowing how he wanted to use them. A builder saw a [Tweet containing an idea for a new app called “Partybid”](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1383238473767813125?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1383238473767813125%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd.mirror.xyz%2FFLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) and [decided to spend his weekend coding up a v1](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1384372491053846531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1384372491053846531%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd.mirror.xyz%2FFLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4). There’s an authenticity in doing something “just because” that gives credence to these early cycles.\\*\\*\n\nThis *“don’t think, just do”* approach seems to be particularly true among some of the standout DAOs that began on pure adrenaline and “good vibes.” I’m thinking in particular of SharkDAO, which started with the idea that people wanted to collectively bid on Nouns NFTs, and ConstitutionDAO, which spun up (and spun down) in a single week in their quest to purchase a copy of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAmusingly, in this [Verge article about the ConstitutionDAO](https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution), the journalist kept pushing on what was going to happen *after* they bought the U.S. Constitution, asking pragmatic questions like: *“Where would it reside? Who would take care of it?”* The reality is: That wasn’t *really* the point. At least, not right away. The most innovative projects I’ve gotten to know in web3 didn’t start with strategy – they started with *possibility*.\n\n### Sell the dream.\n\nNo matter how crypto-native and digital-first your project may be, your end users are still human (even if they embrace pfps and pseudonyms), and the quickest projects to gain traction are ones that lean into basic human psychology. I noticed four key motivators that galvanized people to jump on board with a new project or initiative. (Which, notably have clear parallels with some of the early traction moments in the world of web2.)\n\n1. **“You’ll be the first.”**\n\n   As one of the first DeFi projects to DAO-ify, [Index Coop](https://indexcoop.com/) fully [decentralized their governance](https://medium.com/indexcoop/introducing-the-index-cooperative-a4eaaf0bcfe2) at a time when the rest of us were still trying to remember what that three-letter acronym stood for. As a result, in addition to unlocking a network of early DeFi evangelists, they also attracted best-in-class community builders, who quite literally quit their day jobs to come up with [guiding principles](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coops-guiding-principles/346) and [new org design concepts](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coop-org-chart/1462) to experiment with a brand new way of working and collaborating. There’s a real benefit to the first-mover advantage.\n2. **“You’ll join an incredible community (of builders).”**\n\n   This is no secret to web3, but it bears repeating: People want to work with great people. Period. Today this largely manifests as developers wanting to build together – which is a large part of the driving action behind the strength of the contributor communities behind Juicebox and PartyBid, or why securing a place on the [Dark Forest leaderboard](https://zkga.me/) holds the equivalent of [Stack Overflow reputation points](https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation) in a web3 era. One of Juicebox’s core contributors, [Jango](https://twitter.com/me_jango), put it best – [“devs like to dev with other devs.”](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/year-of-the-dev/)\n\n   But it’s also apparent in non-developer networks such as CabinDAO, Crypto Coven, and Mirror. In particular, Mirror’s innovative approach to bootstrapping community through the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) brought in high-quality new writers at a manageable, consistent pace. In fact, *every single web3 community* I explored referred to the caliber of the people in their network. Figure out what “that special thing” is for your community, and harness it to attract more like-minded community members.\n3. **“You’ll push the boundaries of what’s possible.”**\n\n   In one of the more clever twists of incentive structure that meets organizational objectives, the game [Dark Forest](https://blog.zkga.me/) was literally built to be broken. The only way to win this world-building and planet-claiming on-chain game is to code your way through automations to streamline your gameplay experience. The foundation that funds the game (among other projects), [0xPARC](https://0xparc.org/about), has a mission to promote application-level innovation on Ethereum. Their open approach to competitive game design has attracted some of the most serious Solidity developers as game players, all excited about the opportunity to push the limits of their code.\n4. **You’ll make money.**\n\n   I’ll spare you the full-on “gold rush” analogy, but you can’t deny the power of the potential upside. In an ownership-first platform, incentives are more important than ever – the trick is getting the balance right. While you don’t need to look far to see how NFT projects drive in “community” through price-gouging, rug pulls, and other cheap tricks, examples of utility-based incentives are much more compelling in the long term. Uniswap’s [model for liquidity providers (now in v3)](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5391541-provide-liquidity-on-uniswap-v3) is a continual iterative effort to educate, incentivize, and empower this core audience segment to their platform. Numerai, which incentivizes data scientists to contribute successful models to their [decentralized hedge fund](https://numer.ai/), amended their incentive structure to reward contributions to their meta model vs. based on individual payouts. The most important advice I received here was simple: Your incentive design must be based around the type of engagement you want. (Easier said than done.)\n\n![Making the “top 10” on the leaderboard for the game, Dark Forest, is just about one of the highest honors you can achieve as a Solidity developer today. (via: https://zkga.me/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kcDA98wo48aG4xtVekWD0.png?height=1228&width=1008)\n\n### Your core team (still) matters more than ever.\n\nWhether you call them founders, builders, or core contributors, the sentiment remains the same. Four of the projects I analyzed can attribute at least part of their initial traction phase to the fact that their core team was previously known or trusted in the space. Like it or not, people with an audience and brand are more likely to galvanize community and early traction.\n\nSee: [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/), started by [Dom](https://twitter.com/dhof), creator of Vine, and [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/), whose core team of Nounders not only also included Dom but other heavy-hitters like the artist [@gremplin](https://twitter.com/gremplin) and [@punk4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156), a prominent thinker and investor. Just like in other industries, smart people tend to pop up again in other smart projects. The more people and projects I spent time with, the more I found intersections and cross-project participation as the norm. Look no further than [Partybid](https://www.partybid.app/)’s origin story, which [literally began as an idea in a single tweet](https://party.mirror.xyz/NHMOTjy3j3EB21GTpWYH3CrMFD2k4WKTB3EpM1dkACc) from Denis Nazarov, former founder and [a16z](https://a16z.com/) crypto partner – not to mention the founder of [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), another successful web3 project. One other big benefit of trusted early builders? It’s a surefire way of guaranteeing that the [“first follower” effect](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbooksauthors/2018/04/11/the-forgotten-first-follower/) attracts a high-caliber network of secondary builders and contributors.\n\n**BEWARE OF: Speculation & Frenzy**\n\nNearly everyone in web3 knows someone who made the right move at the right time and walked away with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of dollars in the bank. Even among the most well-intentioned of projects, you may end up with YouTubers talking about how [Helium is a “magic box to earn you thousands of dollars”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KG-5SnXCTA) or that Loot bags containing Divine Robes [merit selling for as much as 250 ETH](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xff9c1b15b16263c61d017ee9f65c50e4ae0113d7/748). But the spikey viral peaks of growth (and people seeking profits) actually dilute the community. It can be hard to avoid but still noteworthy to mention. [Optimism’s airdrop earlier this year](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/) serves as an early example of a project at staving off arbitrage efforts, but there’s still work to be done. There’s something to be said for the bear market we’re in: Despite people objectively losing money, it does provide an opportunity for building over speculation.\n\n## \\[2: decentralizing how work gets done\\]\n\n![Protocol improvement proposals, a process for suggesting changes to the platform or project, are often voted upon in Snapshot, as is the case with Uniswap’s governance process. (via https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6jshYP1cw5vcJf4ahSOOw.png?height=1322&width=2144&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nOnce you’ve started a web3 community, you’ll probably start wondering how much to empower the community – both in decision-making and how that work is executed. While most web3 projects look at *how decisions get made* as the determining factor around its state of decentralization, an [emergent theory from Spencer Graham](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/tGT32p-lA__63rmTXq_OD_iTTDoK-vsUn3QVsnnWmvo) suggests that the purest form should include both decentralized decision-making *and* decentralized execution. In other words: ***“How ‘decentralized’ are you, really?”***\n\nThroughout my research, I’ve ranked each project against a 5-point scale – *the “decentralization spectrum” –* ranging from fully decentralized to fully centralized.\n\n### Decentralization Spectrum\n\nFully Decentralized **⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AQNhAAeQ2o86-bNcGpHwEiJiyeMqhVa0onUZBMxPNaw/edit#slide=id.p) ⬤ ⬤** Fully Centralized\n\nYou’ll notice that, at least among this subset of arguably well-known projects, “pure decentralization” (all decisions & actions are taken in a decentralized way) is the outlier, not the norm. And very few start as fully decentralized, with the exception of Bitcoin itself, and possibly also Loot. The vast majority fall somewhere in the middle.\n\n![The Decentralization Spectrum is a 5-point scale approximation of the relative level of decentralization for any project, based on how decisions and work is accomplished.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pZxLlcQ3ZTZ6lwF_Lfl02.png?height=540&width=960)\n\n### Share transparent and public documentation.\n\nIt’s no secret that web3 projects build in public. With open Discord servers, Twitter threads, public-facing governance forums, and voting through Snapshot, nearly every project has a wide degree of open, transparent documentation to their users and community.\n\n**But – Just because something exists on the open web does *not* mean it is equally accessible to all.** I first started this project intending to do wholly independent solo research into each web3 community. But I quickly discovered this was not sustainable. As a newcomer to all of these spaces, it took me *hours* of time to untangle the [sometimes cryptic websites](https://zkga.me/), dozens of pages of documentation, and decipher the meaning behind each Discord server’s channel names.\n\nIn web2, we attributed broad developer adoption of new technology due in part to a product’s ease of API access and documentation. In web3, we look at their Notion pages, Discord groups, and onboarding flow. A couple of examples stand out here right away in terms of their level of accessibility and robustness of their materials: Index Coop, both in terms of its [new member onboarding](https://onboarding.catapultlabs.xyz/indexcoop) and [handbook](https://docs.indexcoop.com/); and Juicebox for their [Notion](https://info.juicebox.money/), built with both project creators and developers in mind. An honorable mention goes to NFT project Crypto Coven for their [community-generated public Library](https://cryptocoven.notion.site/cryptocoven/98e0b55d3c2c415bb0bdbb78f68be4a0?v=8f8de19db6484e4b85727c4ef1a5c925), which aggregates both stories of the “lore” surrounding their network and also the basics of DAOs and web3.\n\n![Index Coop’s public community handbook is among the most well-documented and transparent projects for their existing and prospective community members. (via: https://docs.indexcoop.com/) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I0XjJVI2HNx-COhFrl-rM.png?height=1224&width=2536)\n\n### Give your community a voice separate from the core build.\n\nPerhaps one of the most noteworthy trends in decentralized community management is the separation of the community’s influence from that of the core builders. Helium and Uniswap offered the strongest examples of this “church and state” effect in their decision-making frameworks. Both are equipped with a C-corp of core builders and team members and also a non-profit entity (or foundation), which is community-managed.\n\nIn Uniswap’s case, their core team Uniswap Labs owns the product (which includes the web app interface, the widget, and any other products they may roll out), but Uniswap the DAO owns the protocol. Decisions about the protocol are managed through a foundation and government through their open [governance proposal process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732). As one example of how this plays out, the recent decision to deploy v3 of Uniswap can be tracked all the way back to conversations that began in March and followed the four steps in their governance: a [Temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-uniswap-x-celo-green-pool-for-treasury-proposal/16428), a [Consensus check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-uniswap-x-celo-green-pool-for-treasury-proposal/16458), and a [Governance proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-celo/16686), ultimately leading to the [successful deployment](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-v3-deployed-on-celo/17091) on July 13.\n\nHelium is one of many projects that leverages a proposal process to manage requested changes to their protocol, called [HIPs](https://github.com/helium/HIP). (Other examples include [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://eips.ethereum.org/)” (EIPs), and similar processes at [Zcash](https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/main/zip-0000.rst) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).) Managed through Github, these changes are then routed to the core team at Helium, Inc., where most of the core devs of the Helium blockchain are employed. Both of these examples strike a mid-point balance of how to both leverage community engagement and recommendations while still allowing some degree of agility and nimble-ness from a core team.\n\n### Start with an incomplete build.\n\nOne interesting tendency among some web3 projects is to intentionally start with “incomplete builds.” A deck of Loot bags dropping as an NFT collection inspired dozens of side projects, teams, and builders to corral around the “player’s deck” and build out the world with additional elements: [Maps](https://opensea.io/collection/crypts-and-caverns), [Realms](https://scroll.bibliothecadao.xyz/docs/game/realms), [HyperLoot Characters](https://hyperlootproject.com/). A 100% creative commons collection of NFTs called Nouns beacons a new wave of [designers](https://nounstown.wtf/), [animators](https://hackmd.io/@elrgoLkbTcaX3edoqOHuQQ/nouns-the-animated-series), and [storytellers](https://nouns.wtf/vote/83) to contribute to this emergent ecosystem. Dark Forest’s decentralized world-building game was made to be exploited – actively encouraging developers to build plug-ins, integrations, and other boundary-pushing gameplay tactics – even when this sometimes meant [acknowledging when things went a little too far](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1510658041473024010). Each of these projects, and many more in the space, serve as magnets in the way they playfulness and collaboration from a community that not only decides what comes next, but also builds it themselves.\n\nIn each of these examples (arguably the most truly decentralized projects I explored), getting the starting conditions right is more important than ever. [Sina Habibian](https://twitter.com/sinahab) who advises web3 builders in the community Zeitgeist said:\n\n> *“I think being thoughtful/intentional about the initial conditions actually matters more when launching a truly decentralized project (like Loot and Nouns). That's because the core team (if a core team even exists) can't course correct as easily after the fact. There is a strong inertia to the initial choices that influences the direction the community/project evolves.”*\n\n![Loot bags, which you can buy on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, simply contain eight lines of text with randomized items, objects, and gear. What becomes of these “trading cards” is up to the community to decide. (via: https://opensea.io/collection/lootproject)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EFSHPVSzFcIMxSjz2j3Te.png?height=880&width=1862)\n\n### Consider an intermediate layer of community leadership\n\nNearly every DAO I spoke with had some additional layer of community leadership to help manage their broader network. While the obvious thought may be to simply assign Discord permissions to server members who step up, authentic design for community ambassador programs stems much more organically. Index Coop uses something called “Owl Levels” to designate different levels of seniority in the community (Gold, Silver and Bronze, each with a vote weighting around them). Numerai elected a “Council of Elders” of senior community members who could make decisions more quickly on behalf of the broader network. Creator Cabins has a “City Council” composed of people with at least 500 $CABIN. These designations seem to serve as an extension from common web2 community-building models such as “developer evangelists,” “influencers,” or even just “brand ambassadors” in that they harbor not only titles and perks, but also some influence and authority.\n\n**BEWARE OF: The temptation to turn everything into a community vote.**\n\nProlific web3 community thought leader, [@rafathebuilder](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder), who has engaged in communities including Creator Cabins and Mirror observed:\n\n> *\"I think there’s a thing of “minimum required decentralization” — there are real trade-offs. Many organizations need to sacrifice efficiency and build decentralization through slow, organic growth. If you’re aiming for decentralization, you’re not aiming to make it cheap. You’re not optimizing on cost to production, you’re optimizing on the resiliency of the network.\"*\n\nOne of the most thoughtful essays I read on this topic came from Jon Hills at CabinDAO: *[How Decentralized Organizations Win (And Lose).](https://creators.mirror.xyz/6-iNptibzKNrQaZJR_ufiMkLQvj5mgpFYueWFKu9agU)* In this piece, Jon challenges the notion of “decentralized absolutism” and identifies principles from four (non-crypto-native) organizations that flexibly adapt around the needs of their community, without offering 100% of the power to the people. This tension is one that many crypto-native builders will need to reconcile with among their own projects and protocols – both the opportunities and challenges involved.\n\n## \\[3: converting people into participants into builders\\]\n\n![Despite the digital-first nature of web3, community is core to the ethos of builders in the space; at the Devconnect conference in Amsterdam earlier this year, a pop-up coworking space accommodated 500+ people at once. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fFvx0foJhuJDJz-uxaJ3W.png?height=3024&width=4032&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nIn an ownership economy, the active participation of members in web3 communities matters as much as users matter in web2. Many builders and founders are asking: **“What’s the web3 conversion funnel? How do I get people to go from an idle observer to a community member to an active participant in my project?”** While there’s no magic wand answer to this question (just as there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to classic marketing funnel activities in web2), here are a few observations (and one misconception) I observed from the projects in my research.\n\n### Know who your audience is (and who it isn’t).\n\nThe strongest web3 communities I encountered had absolutely no qualms about acknowledging who exactly they were targeting. Crypto Coven perhaps nails this most of all – going after “femme” culture in web3 and positioning themselves as the “anti crypto bro” culture. From the moment you [land on their website](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/), you’re transported into a different place – one of witchy language, folklore, premonitions and prophecies.\n\nWhile you might start out, as Crypto Coven’s team of “High Witches” did, intentionally targeting an audience for your project, it’s far more common for teams to discover this organically. Such was the case for Index Coop, whose audience of DeFi evangelists emerged slowly, [with each new product](https://indexcoop.com/products) that launched. With each additional product launch, a new sub-community niche emerges on Index, with each contributing in its own way to the DAO.\n\nBy contrast, Helium, a project [originally founded as an IoT company in 2013](https://blog.helium.com/welcome-to-heliums-decentralized-machine-network-2e7b0801da44), has a very high rate of brand-new-to-crypto people — for many of them, Helium is the only crypto project they’re involved in, which has influenced the flavor of community organizing in a lot of ways. These severe audience differences are also what make it impossible to define one universal approach to community.\n\n![From the second you land on Crypto Coven’s website, you know you’ve entered another world entirely. This self-selecting mechanism helps them serve as a magnet for the audience that would most align with their community. (via: https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/lore) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/On8CtKMMGb-lVAB2gk-W5.png?height=1072&width=2170)\n\n### Recognize that your most passionate community-members are willing to work for free\n\nI used to believe that most of the power in web3 existed in the inherent incentive structure for every community action taken. Whether you pick up a bounty, refer a new collaborator, or contribute in some other way, I was under the impression that all actions received some incentive or compensation as reward.\n\nBut the more I unfolded the layers of these communities that I spoke with, the more I learned that incentives are a bit of a “squishy” area – even in web3. For one, hundreds of people donated to CabinDAO’s original mission – to fund creative retreats for emerging artists – without personally benefiting from that outcome. The 17,000 people who contributed to ConstitutionDAO’s insane crowdfund campaign did so as a mere curiosity, with zero expectation of a return on that investment. But people aren’t just willing to donate money; they also donate time. Danny Aranda, now a core contributor at PartyDAO, started just as any other community participant. He said:\n\n> *\"I was a DAO member like anyone else. I started working on the project pretty organically and pretty unpaid. There was a governance proposal that we should start paying Danny, and then there was more work, and I started getting paid full time.\"*\n\nDanny’s use case is a particularly good example of how projects can assess project-market fit among their community: If people are willing to work for free (at least initially), you’ve found your hook.\n\n[In a survey of 400+ DAO members that Gitcoin conducted](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLJvPOvibcCUpJ9ES44_cdoX5Hb7LpDaloGWz5FbUEM/edit#slide=id.gea346d7c21_1_101), roughly half of respondents reported that DAOs are *not* their primary source of income. (Interestingly, this is the same percent of people who reported having at least 12 months of savings, so the relative financial security of DAO contributors may contribute toward their earnestness to take on unpaid work.) And my favorite example was learning that the [“Council of Elders”](https://twitter.com/NumeraiCoE) at Numerai also isn’t exactly paid to do that work – but the reputation of being an Elder stands on its own, and they did gift them cloaks, which the team excitedly wore in solidarity at IRL conferences together.\n\n**To be clear: I’m not suggesting that you *stop* paying your community members for their hard work and labor.** Most of these projects made it quite clear to me that there are thresholds of free work to bounty-based work and ultimately to full time, paid work. I’m simply noting that – even in the hyper-tokenized world of web3, sometimes you can get great people to do great things by just buying them some cool-looking cloaks.\n\n![Numerai consistently seeks out opportunities to reward contributors to their project in unique ways, including through this recent campaign giving away free “NFTees.” (via: https://twitter.com/NumeraiCoE/status/1547243673519214593)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6pcv3qkJ5QPFr1GZnwjrs.png?height=1202&width=1094)\n\n### Focus on a small core team of builders and a broad team of evangelists\n\nTo the outside observer, Discord server size serves as a false flag measurement of true engagement. Even for projects with Discord communities in the tens of thousands (Uniswap) or hundreds of thousands (Helium), the relative size of the contributing team is small by comparison. As a project leader, there’s a serious temptation to get sucked into the groundswell of needs, requests, ideas and suggestions from these bottomless communities. But a more disciplined, constraint-based approach to growth can help you stay focused on the North Star for your community. For most projects, the percent of community members who are also core contributors or builders is much smaller than you may think.\n\nThe best example of a strategic and intentional rollout of a product-led community strategy is through Mirror’s [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race). For more than six months, Mirror invited writers to submit content for that week’s competition, and token holders voted to admit 10 new members each week. These new members quickly became early adopters, finding kinship not only in a peer community of high-quality writers but also informing future product & protocol development for Mirror’s core team.\n\nFinally, I’ll note that some DAOs – and many NFT projects – are quick to pick out one simple, easy way for their broad base of members to serve as evangelists. This might be actively encouraging members to rock their swag ([like Bored Apes),](https://www.boredapewear.com/) funding projects that also promote brand awareness ([like Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/vote/95)) or even actively engaging on Twitter through memes and pfps. One of the main reasons that I chose Crypto Coven as an NFT project to dive into for this research was due to the intense degree of community outreach I received from the network of Witches in [my initial Twitter inquiry about community research](https://twitter.com/bethanymarz/status/1506356530614087688).\n\n![Splashy partnerships and hype installations, such as this Bored Apes inflatable as part of NFT NYC week are a popular tactic to drive brand awareness among web3 communities. (via: https://www.wsj.com/articles/marketers-at-nft-nyc-upbeat-on-brand-building-in-the-metaverse-11656324000)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PGRQr8lBFkYKgpx7r4hG0.jpeg?height=1146&width=1720)\n\n**BEWARE OF: Facilitating chatter vs. true community engagement.**\n\nIt would be a mistake to go through the motions of community, or simply follow suit to “run the playbook” of another DAO or crypto-native project. [Conway Anderson](https://twitter.com/ConwayAnderson), web3 builder and early Loot adopter has observed this in many networks he has been a part of. He said:\n\n> *“Nothing happens if you just create a Discord and put people there. Nobody really knows what they want to do. The best DAOs / products in the space have usually been a group of people who execute and through that, the broader community starts to go, “What if…?” There’s usually a certain threshold where other people start to come in.”*\n\nPart of achieving this level of engagement involves leaning into the parts of your project that are uniquely web3 – and legitimately wouldn’t be possible to build in web2 structures. Rafa noted:\n\n> *“I think that the reason why web3 feels special is because many protocols weren’t public infrastructure before web3, they were private infrastructure. It’s really hard to build a community around private infrastructure that’s more than just a “fan base” (like Apple). But it’s much harder to maintain that community when it comes to private infrastructure. Today's opportunity to unlock the power of evangelism is of a different magnitude. You have so much connectivity; you can tailor your message, do automatic translations, crowdfunds, anyone can send anyone money or pool resources together.”*\n\n## \\[4: measuring success\\]\n\n![Every community defines success differently. SharkDAO’s mission is to pool together resources to buy Nouns, and ultimately help people find their way into the Nouns NFT ecosystem. (via: https://sharks.wtf/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UXhYi3cFM5hKD7LRu116r.png?height=1064&width=1038)\n\nJust as every company carries a different definition for success, so does every community. But in this research, I encountered a few grounding principles that seemed to help some projects identify their True North, keep up the momentum, and galvanize ongoing community engagement. Here’s what that looks like in practice.\n\n### Decide whether you’re building infrastructure, or providing engagement.\n\nFirst – identify your True North Star. Some of the best advice I received during this project came from learning about [Rafa](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder)’s distinction in building infrastructure vs. engagements. In a real-world example, he challenged me to consider the way that you might cultivate community in a neighborhood. **One option is to build infrastructure – parks, churches, community centers – and let people organically self-organize. The alternative is to design activities – block parties, game nights, town meetings – and engage people around events.**\n\nAs a web3 project leader – there’s a clear choice to make. You can build a community around your protocol (such as how Helium, Mirror, and Uniswap have done), or you can offer event-based programming designed to keep your community members coming back. (The latter is not only the case for most NFT projects but also for the myriad of DAOs, learning communities, and other decentralized, member-based networks in web3 today.) While this choice isn’t necessarily a binary one, it is something you should formulate a thesis around for your particular project.\n\n### Have a bias to action.\n\nSecond – the web3 equivalent of “move fast and break things” – Say “yes” to new partnerships and opportunities. This happens in real time, all the time: A new connection at a conference becomes an NFT artist for your next project; an errant message on Twitter or Telegram blossoms into a new Discord and a game plan to bid on the U.S. Constitution with a DAO. Due to the quick cycles of experimentation and iteration necessary for this new era, saving some space to say yes to more spontaneous opportunities (and being open-minded about what those might be) is just about one of the best decisions you can make.A few examples: CabinDAO didn’t start as a DAO. Their founder Jon hosted a group of friends for a soft launch at his initial properties once they were completed, and one of the attendees spoke about the opportunity to use crypto to scale the creator co-op that they had all been working on together. Both of the early projects that gave Juicebox their initial traction came from their core contributor Jango jumping right into two fast-moving hype projects (SharkDAO and ConstitutionDAO) – volunteering their product as the means to make it possible. It matters less if you are ready: What matters is that you are there.\n\n### Invite your community to play.\n\nThird – make it irresistible to walk away. Let’s be honest: There’s a lot of “un-fun” things about the world today. It’s easy to forget how delightful it feels to have a good laugh or take on something *totally ridiculous* with strangers on the Internet. But some of the stickiest projects I encountered – the ones you can’t help but root for no matter what – are just fun, plain and simple.\n\nI’ll bet you can’t sit through 10 minutes of [“Noun’o’clock” in the Noun Square](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock) without cracking a smile. These daily Twitter spaces commentary treats the conclusion of each live NFT auction like a sporting event, complete with wacky sound effects, and witty banter as the group follows along in real time watching potential new Noun NFTs get randomly generated.\n\n(Think a bunch of people shouting at once, things like: *“This one’s a messy design but I like it.” “I like the bonsai but not with that shirt.” “The sunglasses flamingo?! Come on!” “I’m still thinking about that pineapple.”)*\n\n![Part of “Noun’o’clock” includes a social engagement tactic called “Fomo Nouns” where randomized Nouns appear (like this flamingo-headed avatar) and participants quickly vote on which one to mint. (via: https://fomonouns.wtf/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/POMIHo6rT-HoDaa2Bz5M4.png?height=1112&width=1434)\n\nWhen I attended DevConnect earlier this year, I sat down with the core contributors behind [dfdao](http://www.dfdao.xyz/), the DAO that came together to collectively compete in the game, Dark Forest. As a non-gamer, I was stuck on one question: *“Why?”* Why did you dedicate time away from your full-time jobs to compete at a world-building game with anons all over the world? Why were you compelled to make sure you had always had someone to operate as a “pilot” to execute game play around the clock, every five minutes, for a week straight?\n\nIt didn’t click until I sat through a presentation from Ivan at 0xPARC about Dark Forest. When discussing community engagement in their game, he paused to talk about how dfdao had exposed a vulnerability that let them directly target an opponent and drain all of the resources from their planet. When he showed what this looked like in the universal map ([slide 32 in his deck here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u1nBl5Lu9q24j9pX5B9fyhwNSyZGK58nVbEoe8rNJIk/edit#slide=id.g124c1af0a63_1_103)), I watched the dfdao team proudly grin at each other ear-to-ear, audibly cackling about their cheeky path to victory. That’s when it finally hit me: To them, it’s all just play. And they are having the time of their lives.\n\nThe most fun I had on the Internet last year was watching the livestream of the Sotheby’s auction for the U.S. Constitution. The chat, Discord, and Twitter were simultaneously flooded by [memes](https://twitter.com/laurenlself/status/1459341510655180803) and [inside jokes](https://twitter.com/pseudotheos/status/1461348482401255445) and [speculation](https://twitter.com/abcoathup/status/1461495987298471942). And even when we learned we lost the bid – when the stated goal of the project failed to come to pass – the community pressed on. [This interview](https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution) with Jonah Erlich, a core ConstitutionDAO contributor, highlighted it best:\n\n> ***“Do you have a sense of why people are building a secondary market for this \\[$PEOPLE\\] token?”***\n>\n> *“People like the memes.”*\\*\n>\n> **“You think that’s it?”**\n>\n> *Yeah. People like the memes; they like to have fun. I think that one thing that I’ve learned from exploring the crypto world is that it’s very hard to rationalize a lot of the different momentums — things that happen with memes and with the memetic transfer of information. I think if people are having fun and they’re doing their thing, then I don’t try to interpret it too deeply, because I’m just going to break my brain.”*\n\nSometimes, you must throw away rationality and [“seize the memes of production.”](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1434785416536854529?lang=en)\n\n![Nicholas Cage was the star of the show for much of the meme-culture that existed around the ConstitutionDAO marketing strategy.

(Except for possibly, Uniswap, which towers above the rest as the [most beloved blockchain-enabled app](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLJvPOvibcCUpJ9ES44_cdoX5Hb7LpDaloGWz5FbUEM/edit#slide=id.gea6e71d04f_0_95). That is, at least, for now.) If web2 volatility has taught us anything, it’s that the project that can’t pivot is the project that will fail. Adaptability is key to success.\n\n## \\[wrap-up\\]\n\nSuffice it to say, a lot has happened over the past two years. The bull market run-up leading up through late 2021 crowded a lot of these spaces and communities with more energy than web3 has ever seen before – and through that saturation of energy, we witnessed an immense degree of experimentation & iteration. While temperatures have cooled somewhat in the recent macroeconomic environment and slow-down, we find ourselves at an interesting inflection point, one which allows us to take stock, dig a little deeper, and catch our bearings to direct our attention in more deliberate, intentional ways for the next phase of the crypto adoption curve.\n\nAs of yet, there is still no clear-cut winner – no single company or project who has “solved” decentralization completely (if that’s even the objective). But it is exciting to see some early patterns and behaviors emerge, ones that might guide the next generation of builders and creators (maybe including you).\n\nI invite you to continue this project with me through both exploring & contributing to the library of resources I used along the way.\n\nI’ll be releasing the rest of these individual stories on a weekly cadence [here on Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/bethanymarz.eth).

{"id": "ZjjyIJzWZio6W-cPyr4kykcOEsCis0bhZVZL_kD4jEc", "title": "What We Can Learn from Decentralized Community Building", "body": "### A distilled insights guide for web3 founders & builders\n\n## \\[intro\\]\n\nOver the past two years, we’ve witnessed a [meteoric](https://messari.io/governor/daos) [rise](https://discoverdaos.com/dao-directory) in the power of decentralized community-building. In a crypto-native, [ownership-first era](https://variant.fund/writing/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software), users are opting to spend their time in digital places that offer not just a better user experience, but more autonomy and influence, more economic incentives, more connection, and ultimately, more fun.\n\nAs a result, from the moment a new crypto-native project idea takes hold, questions of community emerge almost immediately. It begs the question: ***“As a founder or builder in web3, what do you need to know about integrating community into your project? And what does this look like in a decentralized way?”***\n\nPrior to 2020, I’d spent a lot of time analyzing the ins and outs of centralized community-building best practices, largely from the examples of successful web2 networks that I got to know as a user (Foursquare, Meetup, Twitter), as an employee (Stack Overflow), or through osmosis during my time at Union Square Ventures. Last fall, I synthesized many of my [web2 community-building observations into a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HG21WQJ1J7WzfaRuaLOhbKOKiGLAoeUZ5mY8jS6V9PE/edit#slide=id.p) that drew a few parallels (and a lot of open-ended questions) about what those lessons might mean in a web3 world.\n\nBut when I started working a little more closely with a web3 builder community, called [Zeitgeist](https://mirror.xyz/zeitgeistxyz.eth), I realized that the questions founders were asking were much more acute.\n\n1. **How do we get started?**\n2. **How do we decentralize how work gets done?**\n3. **How do we convert people from awareness to participants to builders?**\n4. **How do we measure success?**\n\nTo address these questions, I began to explore the best practices from a wide range of decentralized projects, ranging from NFT networks and crowd-funding platforms to games and DeFi. **The goal of this post is to distill this research into key insights, with a target audience of both web3 builders and crypto-curious entrepreneurs.**\n\n## \\[the projects\\]\n\nDrawing on advice from community members in many of these spaces, I explored 12 projects, with an eye toward better understanding best practices among crypto-native communities. While I conducted much of the primary research independently, I also spoke with a core contributor at many of these initiatives to validate some of my findings and fill in some blanks.\n\nThey are:\n\n### Crowd-funding DAOs:\n\n* **[PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/)**[ ](https://www.partybid.app/)\n  **Protocol for buying NFTs as a team**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.partybid.app/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n  *[\\[Read the full writeup\\]](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/edit/WKzmZICjcIowNpC7JNICfZJdxhLwC_wn1d8RwPxRK-A)*\n* **[Juicebox](https://www.juicebox.money/)\n  Decentralized funding platform**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.juicebox.money/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/)\n  A community of remote cabins for independent online creators**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### DeFi:\n\n* **[Index Coop](https://indexcoop.com/)**\n  **Decentralized investment vehicles for access to crypto tokens**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://indexcoop.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)\n  Decentralized crypto trading protocol**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://uniswap.org/) ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### Gaming:\n\n* **[Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/)\n  Decentralized world-building game**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://indexcoop.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/)\n  Adventure gear stored on-chain as NFTs**\n  Fully Decentralized [⬤](https://www.lootproject.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### NFTs:\n\n* **[Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/)**[\n  ](https://nouns.wtf/)**Creative commons community of on-chain avatars**\n  Fully Decentralized [⬤](https://nouns.wtf/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Crypto Coven](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/)**[\n  ](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/)**Femme-focused crypto community of Witches**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/) ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### Other Applications:\n\n* **[Helium](https://www.helium.com/)**[\n  ](https://www.helium.com/)**Decentralized wireless infrastructure**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://www.helium.com/) ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)**[ ](https://mirror.xyz/)\n  **Decentralized, on-chain platform for publishing & funding** \n Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://mirror.xyz/) ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Numerai](https://numer.ai/)\n  Decentralized hedge fund built upon a data science tournament**Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://numer.ai/) ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n*\\*If you’re totally new to the space, read these primers first on [DAOs](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-a-dao-and-how-do-they-work/), [DeFi](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/), [NFTs](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq), and [decentralized gaming](https://blog.duelistking.com/explaining-the-concept-of-decentralized-gaming-dfc14fb52b77).*\n\n## \\[the research\\]\n\n**The primary output of this work includes three components:**\n\n1. **This overview** of best practices for web3 founders & builders to keep in mind when asking the question, \\*“How do I build a decentralized community into my product?”\n2. **A series of 12 discrete stories,** one for each project I explored, to walk through the timeline of how things got started and where they stand as of today (July 2022).I’ll be dropping these out through my Mirror here for the next month.

(via https://www.creatorcabins.com/visit)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-z91ofHoIiit1YN1r9_WC.png?height=668&width=1764&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nPerhaps the most frequent question I get asked about community-building is also the simplest: *How do you start?* But the problem with asking people about how they got started is that these stories quickly become part of the romanticized folklore of any startup founding experience. Throughout this research, I did my best to unfurl each project to its starting kernel. Here are the web3 specific nuances and observations that emerged:\n\n### Build first. Strategize second.\n\nOne of the strongest tenets of web3 (or at least the phase of the adoption curve we find ourselves in today) is a culture of building *before* planning. John at CabinDAO quite literally built cabins without knowing how he wanted to use them. A builder saw a [Tweet containing an idea for a new app called “Partybid”](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1383238473767813125?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1383238473767813125%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd.mirror.xyz%2FFLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) and [decided to spend his weekend coding up a v1](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1384372491053846531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1384372491053846531%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd.mirror.xyz%2FFLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4). There’s an authenticity in doing something “just because” that gives credence to these early cycles.\\*\\*\n\nThis *“don’t think, just do”* approach seems to be particularly true among some of the standout DAOs that began on pure adrenaline and “good vibes.” I’m thinking in particular of SharkDAO, which started with the idea that people wanted to collectively bid on Nouns NFTs, and ConstitutionDAO, which spun up (and spun down) in a single week in their quest to purchase a copy of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAmusingly, in this [Verge article about the ConstitutionDAO](https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution), the journalist kept pushing on what was going to happen *after* they bought the U.S. Constitution, asking pragmatic questions like: *“Where would it reside? Who would take care of it?”* The reality is: That wasn’t *really* the point. At least, not right away. The most innovative projects I’ve gotten to know in web3 didn’t start with strategy – they started with *possibility*.\n\n### Sell the dream.\n\nNo matter how crypto-native and digital-first your project may be, your end users are still human (even if they embrace pfps and pseudonyms), and the quickest projects to gain traction are ones that lean into basic human psychology. I noticed four key motivators that galvanized people to jump on board with a new project or initiative. (Which, notably have clear parallels with some of the early traction moments in the world of web2.)\n\n1. **“You’ll be the first.”**\n\n   As one of the first DeFi projects to DAO-ify, [Index Coop](https://indexcoop.com/) fully [decentralized their governance](https://medium.com/indexcoop/introducing-the-index-cooperative-a4eaaf0bcfe2) at a time when the rest of us were still trying to remember what that three-letter acronym stood for. As a result, in addition to unlocking a network of early DeFi evangelists, they also attracted best-in-class community builders, who quite literally quit their day jobs to come up with [guiding principles](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coops-guiding-principles/346) and [new org design concepts](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coop-org-chart/1462) to experiment with a brand new way of working and collaborating. There’s a real benefit to the first-mover advantage.\n2. **“You’ll join an incredible community (of builders).”**\n\n   This is no secret to web3, but it bears repeating: People want to work with great people. Period. Today this largely manifests as developers wanting to build together – which is a large part of the driving action behind the strength of the contributor communities behind Juicebox and PartyBid, or why securing a place on the [Dark Forest leaderboard](https://zkga.me/) holds the equivalent of [Stack Overflow reputation points](https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation) in a web3 era. One of Juicebox’s core contributors, [Jango](https://twitter.com/me_jango), put it best – [“devs like to dev with other devs.”](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/year-of-the-dev/)\n\n   But it’s also apparent in non-developer networks such as CabinDAO, Crypto Coven, and Mirror. In particular, Mirror’s innovative approach to bootstrapping community through the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) brought in high-quality new writers at a manageable, consistent pace. In fact, *every single web3 community* I explored referred to the caliber of the people in their network. Figure out what “that special thing” is for your community, and harness it to attract more like-minded community members.\n3. **“You’ll push the boundaries of what’s possible.”**\n\n   In one of the more clever twists of incentive structure that meets organizational objectives, the game [Dark Forest](https://blog.zkga.me/) was literally built to be broken. The only way to win this world-building and planet-claiming on-chain game is to code your way through automations to streamline your gameplay experience. The foundation that funds the game (among other projects), [0xPARC](https://0xparc.org/about), has a mission to promote application-level innovation on Ethereum. Their open approach to competitive game design has attracted some of the most serious Solidity developers as game players, all excited about the opportunity to push the limits of their code.\n4. **You’ll make money.**\n\n   I’ll spare you the full-on “gold rush” analogy, but you can’t deny the power of the potential upside. In an ownership-first platform, incentives are more important than ever – the trick is getting the balance right. While you don’t need to look far to see how NFT projects drive in “community” through price-gouging, rug pulls, and other cheap tricks, examples of utility-based incentives are much more compelling in the long term. Uniswap’s [model for liquidity providers (now in v3)](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5391541-provide-liquidity-on-uniswap-v3) is a continual iterative effort to educate, incentivize, and empower this core audience segment to their platform. Numerai, which incentivizes data scientists to contribute successful models to their [decentralized hedge fund](https://numer.ai/), amended their incentive structure to reward contributions to their meta model vs. based on individual payouts. The most important advice I received here was simple: Your incentive design must be based around the type of engagement you want. (Easier said than done.)\n\n![Making the “top 10” on the leaderboard for the game, Dark Forest, is just about one of the highest honors you can achieve as a Solidity developer today. (via: https://zkga.me/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kcDA98wo48aG4xtVekWD0.png?height=1228&width=1008)\n\n### Your core team (still) matters more than ever.\n\nWhether you call them founders, builders, or core contributors, the sentiment remains the same. Four of the projects I analyzed can attribute at least part of their initial traction phase to the fact that their core team was previously known or trusted in the space. Like it or not, people with an audience and brand are more likely to galvanize community and early traction.\n\nSee: [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/), started by [Dom](https://twitter.com/dhof), creator of Vine, and [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/), whose core team of Nounders not only also included Dom but other heavy-hitters like the artist [@gremplin](https://twitter.com/gremplin) and [@punk4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156), a prominent thinker and investor. Just like in other industries, smart people tend to pop up again in other smart projects. The more people and projects I spent time with, the more I found intersections and cross-project participation as the norm. Look no further than [Partybid](https://www.partybid.app/)’s origin story, which [literally began as an idea in a single tweet](https://party.mirror.xyz/NHMOTjy3j3EB21GTpWYH3CrMFD2k4WKTB3EpM1dkACc) from Denis Nazarov, former founder and [a16z](https://a16z.com/) crypto partner – not to mention the founder of [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), another successful web3 project. One other big benefit of trusted early builders? It’s a surefire way of guaranteeing that the [“first follower” effect](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbooksauthors/2018/04/11/the-forgotten-first-follower/) attracts a high-caliber network of secondary builders and contributors.\n\n**BEWARE OF: Speculation & Frenzy**\n\nNearly everyone in web3 knows someone who made the right move at the right time and walked away with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of dollars in the bank. Even among the most well-intentioned of projects, you may end up with YouTubers talking about how [Helium is a “magic box to earn you thousands of dollars”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KG-5SnXCTA) or that Loot bags containing Divine Robes [merit selling for as much as 250 ETH](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xff9c1b15b16263c61d017ee9f65c50e4ae0113d7/748). But the spikey viral peaks of growth (and people seeking profits) actually dilute the community. It can be hard to avoid but still noteworthy to mention. [Optimism’s airdrop earlier this year](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/) serves as an early example of a project at staving off arbitrage efforts, but there’s still work to be done. There’s something to be said for the bear market we’re in: Despite people objectively losing money, it does provide an opportunity for building over speculation.\n\n## \\[2: decentralizing how work gets done\\]\n\n![Protocol improvement proposals, a process for suggesting changes to the platform or project, are often voted upon in Snapshot, as is the case with Uniswap’s governance process. (via https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6jshYP1cw5vcJf4ahSOOw.png?height=1322&width=2144&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nOnce you’ve started a web3 community, you’ll probably start wondering how much to empower the community – both in decision-making and how that work is executed. While most web3 projects look at *how decisions get made* as the determining factor around its state of decentralization, an [emergent theory from Spencer Graham](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/tGT32p-lA__63rmTXq_OD_iTTDoK-vsUn3QVsnnWmvo) suggests that the purest form should include both decentralized decision-making *and* decentralized execution. In other words: ***“How ‘decentralized’ are you, really?”***\n\nThroughout my research, I’ve ranked each project against a 5-point scale – *the “decentralization spectrum” –* ranging from fully decentralized to fully centralized.\n\n### Decentralization Spectrum\n\nFully Decentralized **⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AQNhAAeQ2o86-bNcGpHwEiJiyeMqhVa0onUZBMxPNaw/edit#slide=id.p) ⬤ ⬤** Fully Centralized\n\nYou’ll notice that, at least among this subset of arguably well-known projects, “pure decentralization” (all decisions & actions are taken in a decentralized way) is the outlier, not the norm. And very few start as fully decentralized, with the exception of Bitcoin itself, and possibly also Loot. The vast majority fall somewhere in the middle.\n\n![The Decentralization Spectrum is a 5-point scale approximation of the relative level of decentralization for any project, based on how decisions and work is accomplished.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pZxLlcQ3ZTZ6lwF_Lfl02.png?height=540&width=960)\n\n### Share transparent and public documentation.\n\nIt’s no secret that web3 projects build in public. With open Discord servers, Twitter threads, public-facing governance forums, and voting through Snapshot, nearly every project has a wide degree of open, transparent documentation to their users and community.\n\n**But – Just because something exists on the open web does *not* mean it is equally accessible to all.** I first started this project intending to do wholly independent solo research into each web3 community. But I quickly discovered this was not sustainable. As a newcomer to all of these spaces, it took me *hours* of time to untangle the [sometimes cryptic websites](https://zkga.me/), dozens of pages of documentation, and decipher the meaning behind each Discord server’s channel names.\n\nIn web2, we attributed broad developer adoption of new technology due in part to a product’s ease of API access and documentation. In web3, we look at their Notion pages, Discord groups, and onboarding flow. A couple of examples stand out here right away in terms of their level of accessibility and robustness of their materials: Index Coop, both in terms of its [new member onboarding](https://onboarding.catapultlabs.xyz/indexcoop) and [handbook](https://docs.indexcoop.com/); and Juicebox for their [Notion](https://info.juicebox.money/), built with both project creators and developers in mind. An honorable mention goes to NFT project Crypto Coven for their [community-generated public Library](https://cryptocoven.notion.site/cryptocoven/98e0b55d3c2c415bb0bdbb78f68be4a0?v=8f8de19db6484e4b85727c4ef1a5c925), which aggregates both stories of the “lore” surrounding their network and also the basics of DAOs and web3.\n\n![Index Coop’s public community handbook is among the most well-documented and transparent projects for their existing and prospective community members. (via: https://docs.indexcoop.com/) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I0XjJVI2HNx-COhFrl-rM.png?height=1224&width=2536)\n\n### Give your community a voice separate from the core build.\n\nPerhaps one of the most noteworthy trends in decentralized community management is the separation of the community’s influence from that of the core builders. Helium and Uniswap offered the strongest examples of this “church and state” effect in their decision-making frameworks. Both are equipped with a C-corp of core builders and team members and also a non-profit entity (or foundation), which is community-managed.\n\nIn Uniswap’s case, their core team Uniswap Labs owns the product (which includes the web app interface, the widget, and any other products they may roll out), but Uniswap the DAO owns the protocol. Decisions about the protocol are managed through a foundation and government through their open [governance proposal process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732). As one example of how this plays out, the recent decision to deploy v3 of Uniswap can be tracked all the way back to conversations that began in March and followed the four steps in their governance: a [Temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-uniswap-x-celo-green-pool-for-treasury-proposal/16428), a [Consensus check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-uniswap-x-celo-green-pool-for-treasury-proposal/16458), and a [Governance proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-celo/16686), ultimately leading to the [successful deployment](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-v3-deployed-on-celo/17091) on July 13.\n\nHelium is one of many projects that leverages a proposal process to manage requested changes to their protocol, called [HIPs](https://github.com/helium/HIP). (Other examples include [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://eips.ethereum.org/)” (EIPs), and similar processes at [Zcash](https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/main/zip-0000.rst) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).) Managed through Github, these changes are then routed to the core team at Helium, Inc., where most of the core devs of the Helium blockchain are employed. Both of these examples strike a mid-point balance of how to both leverage community engagement and recommendations while still allowing some degree of agility and nimble-ness from a core team.\n\n### Start with an incomplete build.\n\nOne interesting tendency among some web3 projects is to intentionally start with “incomplete builds.” A deck of Loot bags dropping as an NFT collection inspired dozens of side projects, teams, and builders to corral around the “player’s deck” and build out the world with additional elements: [Maps](https://opensea.io/collection/crypts-and-caverns), [Realms](https://scroll.bibliothecadao.xyz/docs/game/realms), [HyperLoot Characters](https://hyperlootproject.com/). A 100% creative commons collection of NFTs called Nouns beacons a new wave of [designers](https://nounstown.wtf/), [animators](https://hackmd.io/@elrgoLkbTcaX3edoqOHuQQ/nouns-the-animated-series), and [storytellers](https://nouns.wtf/vote/83) to contribute to this emergent ecosystem. Dark Forest’s decentralized world-building game was made to be exploited – actively encouraging developers to build plug-ins, integrations, and other boundary-pushing gameplay tactics – even when this sometimes meant [acknowledging when things went a little too far](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1510658041473024010). Each of these projects, and many more in the space, serve as magnets in the way they playfulness and collaboration from a community that not only decides what comes next, but also builds it themselves.\n\nIn each of these examples (arguably the most truly decentralized projects I explored), getting the starting conditions right is more important than ever. [Sina Habibian](https://twitter.com/sinahab) who advises web3 builders in the community Zeitgeist said:\n\n> *“I think being thoughtful/intentional about the initial conditions actually matters more when launching a truly decentralized project (like Loot and Nouns). That's because the core team (if a core team even exists) can't course correct as easily after the fact. There is a strong inertia to the initial choices that influences the direction the community/project evolves.”*\n\n![Loot bags, which you can buy on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, simply contain eight lines of text with randomized items, objects, and gear. What becomes of these “trading cards” is up to the community to decide. (via: https://opensea.io/collection/lootproject)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EFSHPVSzFcIMxSjz2j3Te.png?height=880&width=1862)\n\n### Consider an intermediate layer of community leadership\n\nNearly every DAO I spoke with had some additional layer of community leadership to help manage their broader network. While the obvious thought may be to simply assign Discord permissions to server members who step up, authentic design for community ambassador programs stems much more organically. Index Coop uses something called “Owl Levels” to designate different levels of seniority in the community (Gold, Silver and Bronze, each with a vote weighting around them). Numerai elected a “Council of Elders” of senior community members who could make decisions more quickly on behalf of the broader network. Creator Cabins has a “City Council” composed of people with at least 500 $CABIN. These designations seem to serve as an extension from common web2 community-building models such as “developer evangelists,” “influencers,” or even just “brand ambassadors” in that they harbor not only titles and perks, but also some influence and authority.\n\n**BEWARE OF: The temptation to turn everything into a community vote.**\n\nProlific web3 community thought leader, [@rafathebuilder](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder), who has engaged in communities including Creator Cabins and Mirror observed:\n\n> *\"I think there’s a thing of “minimum required decentralization” — there are real trade-offs. Many organizations need to sacrifice efficiency and build decentralization through slow, organic growth. If you’re aiming for decentralization, you’re not aiming to make it cheap. You’re not optimizing on cost to production, you’re optimizing on the resiliency of the network.\"*\n\nOne of the most thoughtful essays I read on this topic came from Jon Hills at CabinDAO: *[How Decentralized Organizations Win (And Lose).](https://creators.mirror.xyz/6-iNptibzKNrQaZJR_ufiMkLQvj5mgpFYueWFKu9agU)* In this piece, Jon challenges the notion of “decentralized absolutism” and identifies principles from four (non-crypto-native) organizations that flexibly adapt around the needs of their community, without offering 100% of the power to the people. This tension is one that many crypto-native builders will need to reconcile with among their own projects and protocols – both the opportunities and challenges involved.\n\n## \\[3: converting people into participants into builders\\]\n\n![Despite the digital-first nature of web3, community is core to the ethos of builders in the space; at the Devconnect conference in Amsterdam earlier this year, a pop-up coworking space accommodated 500+ people at once. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fFvx0foJhuJDJz-uxaJ3W.png?height=3024&width=4032&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nIn an ownership economy, the active participation of members in web3 communities matters as much as users matter in web2. Many builders and founders are asking: **“What’s the web3 conversion funnel? How do I get people to go from an idle observer to a community member to an active participant in my project?”** While there’s no magic wand answer to this question (just as there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to classic marketing funnel activities in web2), here are a few observations (and one misconception) I observed from the projects in my research.\n\n### Know who your audience is (and who it isn’t).\n\nThe strongest web3 communities I encountered had absolutely no qualms about acknowledging who exactly they were targeting. Crypto Coven perhaps nails this most of all – going after “femme” culture in web3 and positioning themselves as the “anti crypto bro” culture. From the moment you [land on their website](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/), you’re transported into a different place – one of witchy language, folklore, premonitions and prophecies.\n\nWhile you might start out, as Crypto Coven’s team of “High Witches” did, intentionally targeting an audience for your project, it’s far more common for teams to discover this organically. Such was the case for Index Coop, whose audience of DeFi evangelists emerged slowly, [with each new product](https://indexcoop.com/products) that launched. With each additional product launch, a new sub-community niche emerges on Index, with each contributing in its own way to the DAO.\n\nBy contrast, Helium, a project [originally founded as an IoT company in 2013](https://blog.helium.com/welcome-to-heliums-decentralized-machine-network-2e7b0801da44), has a very high rate of brand-new-to-crypto people — for many of them, Helium is the only crypto project they’re involved in, which has influenced the flavor of community organizing in a lot of ways. These severe audience differences are also what make it impossible to define one universal approach to community.\n\n![From the second you land on Crypto Coven’s website, you know you’ve entered another world entirely. This self-selecting mechanism helps them serve as a magnet for the audience that would most align with their community. (via: https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/lore) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/On8CtKMMGb-lVAB2gk-W5.png?height=1072&width=2170)\n\n### Recognize that your most passionate community-members are willing to work for free\n\nI used to believe that most of the power in web3 existed in the inherent incentive structure for every community action taken. Whether you pick up a bounty, refer a new collaborator, or contribute in some other way, I was under the impression that all actions received some incentive or compensation as reward.\n\nBut the more I unfolded the layers of these communities that I spoke with, the more I learned that incentives are a bit of a “squishy” area – even in web3. For one, hundreds of people donated to CabinDAO’s original mission – to fund creative retreats for emerging artists – without personally benefiting from that outcome. The 17,000 people who contributed to ConstitutionDAO’s insane crowdfund campaign did so as a mere curiosity, with zero expectation of a return on that investment. But people aren’t just willing to donate money; they also donate time. Danny Aranda, now a core contributor at PartyDAO, started just as any other community participant. He said:\n\n> *\"I was a DAO member like anyone else. I started working on the project pretty organically and pretty unpaid. There was a governance proposal that we should start paying Danny, and then there was more work, and I started getting paid full time.\"*\n\nDanny’s use case is a particularly good example of how projects can assess project-market fit among their community: If people are willing to work for free (at least initially), you’ve found your hook.\n\n[In a survey of 400+ DAO members that Gitcoin conducted](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLJvPOvibcCUpJ9ES44_cdoX5Hb7LpDaloGWz5FbUEM/edit#slide=id.gea346d7c21_1_101), roughly half of respondents reported that DAOs are *not* their primary source of income. (Interestingly, this is the same percent of people who reported having at least 12 months of savings, so the relative financial security of DAO contributors may contribute toward their earnestness to take on unpaid work.) And my favorite example was learning that the [“Council of Elders”](https://twitter.com/NumeraiCoE) at Numerai also isn’t exactly paid to do that work – but the reputation of being an Elder stands on its own, and they did gift them cloaks, which the team excitedly wore in solidarity at IRL conferences together.\n\n**To be clear: I’m not suggesting that you *stop* paying your community members for their hard work and labor.** Most of these projects made it quite clear to me that there are thresholds of free work to bounty-based work and ultimately to full time, paid work. I’m simply noting that – even in the hyper-tokenized world of web3, sometimes you can get great people to do great things by just buying them some cool-looking cloaks.\n\n![Numerai consistently seeks out opportunities to reward contributors to their project in unique ways, including through this recent campaign giving away free “NFTees.” (via: https://twitter.com/NumeraiCoE/status/1547243673519214593)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6pcv3qkJ5QPFr1GZnwjrs.png?height=1202&width=1094)\n\n### Focus on a small core team of builders and a broad team of evangelists\n\nTo the outside observer, Discord server size serves as a false flag measurement of true engagement. Even for projects with Discord communities in the tens of thousands (Uniswap) or hundreds of thousands (Helium), the relative size of the contributing team is small by comparison. As a project leader, there’s a serious temptation to get sucked into the groundswell of needs, requests, ideas and suggestions from these bottomless communities. But a more disciplined, constraint-based approach to growth can help you stay focused on the North Star for your community. For most projects, the percent of community members who are also core contributors or builders is much smaller than you may think.\n\nThe best example of a strategic and intentional rollout of a product-led community strategy is through Mirror’s [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race). For more than six months, Mirror invited writers to submit content for that week’s competition, and token holders voted to admit 10 new members each week. These new members quickly became early adopters, finding kinship not only in a peer community of high-quality writers but also informing future product & protocol development for Mirror’s core team.\n\nFinally, I’ll note that some DAOs – and many NFT projects – are quick to pick out one simple, easy way for their broad base of members to serve as evangelists. This might be actively encouraging members to rock their swag ([like Bored Apes),](https://www.boredapewear.com/) funding projects that also promote brand awareness ([like Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/vote/95)) or even actively engaging on Twitter through memes and pfps. One of the main reasons that I chose Crypto Coven as an NFT project to dive into for this research was due to the intense degree of community outreach I received from the network of Witches in [my initial Twitter inquiry about community research](https://twitter.com/bethanymarz/status/1506356530614087688).\n\n![Splashy partnerships and hype installations, such as this Bored Apes inflatable as part of NFT NYC week are a popular tactic to drive brand awareness among web3 communities. (via: https://www.wsj.com/articles/marketers-at-nft-nyc-upbeat-on-brand-building-in-the-metaverse-11656324000)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PGRQr8lBFkYKgpx7r4hG0.jpeg?height=1146&width=1720)\n\n**BEWARE OF: Facilitating chatter vs. true community engagement.**\n\nIt would be a mistake to go through the motions of community, or simply follow suit to “run the playbook” of another DAO or crypto-native project. [Conway Anderson](https://twitter.com/ConwayAnderson), web3 builder and early Loot adopter has observed this in many networks he has been a part of. He said:\n\n> *“Nothing happens if you just create a Discord and put people there. Nobody really knows what they want to do. The best DAOs / products in the space have usually been a group of people who execute and through that, the broader community starts to go, “What if…?” There’s usually a certain threshold where other people start to come in.”*\n\nPart of achieving this level of engagement involves leaning into the parts of your project that are uniquely web3 – and legitimately wouldn’t be possible to build in web2 structures. Rafa noted:\n\n> *“I think that the reason why web3 feels special is because many protocols weren’t public infrastructure before web3, they were private infrastructure. It’s really hard to build a community around private infrastructure that’s more than just a “fan base” (like Apple). But it’s much harder to maintain that community when it comes to private infrastructure. Today's opportunity to unlock the power of evangelism is of a different magnitude. You have so much connectivity; you can tailor your message, do automatic translations, crowdfunds, anyone can send anyone money or pool resources together.”*\n\n## \\[4: measuring success\\]\n\n![Every community defines success differently. SharkDAO’s mission is to pool together resources to buy Nouns, and ultimately help people find their way into the Nouns NFT ecosystem. (via: https://sharks.wtf/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UXhYi3cFM5hKD7LRu116r.png?height=1064&width=1038)\n\nJust as every company carries a different definition for success, so does every community. But in this research, I encountered a few grounding principles that seemed to help some projects identify their True North, keep up the momentum, and galvanize ongoing community engagement. Here’s what that looks like in practice.\n\n### Decide whether you’re building infrastructure, or providing engagement.\n\nFirst – identify your True North Star. Some of the best advice I received during this project came from learning about [Rafa](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder)’s distinction in building infrastructure vs. engagements. In a real-world example, he challenged me to consider the way that you might cultivate community in a neighborhood. **One option is to build infrastructure – parks, churches, community centers – and let people organically self-organize. The alternative is to design activities – block parties, game nights, town meetings – and engage people around events.**\n\nAs a web3 project leader – there’s a clear choice to make. You can build a community around your protocol (such as how Helium, Mirror, and Uniswap have done), or you can offer event-based programming designed to keep your community members coming back. (The latter is not only the case for most NFT projects but also for the myriad of DAOs, learning communities, and other decentralized, member-based networks in web3 today.) While this choice isn’t necessarily a binary one, it is something you should formulate a thesis around for your particular project.\n\n### Have a bias to action.\n\nSecond – the web3 equivalent of “move fast and break things” – Say “yes” to new partnerships and opportunities. This happens in real time, all the time: A new connection at a conference becomes an NFT artist for your next project; an errant message on Twitter or Telegram blossoms into a new Discord and a game plan to bid on the U.S. Constitution with a DAO. Due to the quick cycles of experimentation and iteration necessary for this new era, saving some space to say yes to more spontaneous opportunities (and being open-minded about what those might be) is just about one of the best decisions you can make.A few examples: CabinDAO didn’t start as a DAO. Their founder Jon hosted a group of friends for a soft launch at his initial properties once they were completed, and one of the attendees spoke about the opportunity to use crypto to scale the creator co-op that they had all been working on together. Both of the early projects that gave Juicebox their initial traction came from their core contributor Jango jumping right into two fast-moving hype projects (SharkDAO and ConstitutionDAO) – volunteering their product as the means to make it possible. It matters less if you are ready: What matters is that you are there.\n\n### Invite your community to play.\n\nThird – make it irresistible to walk away. Let’s be honest: There’s a lot of “un-fun” things about the world today. It’s easy to forget how delightful it feels to have a good laugh or take on something *totally ridiculous* with strangers on the Internet. But some of the stickiest projects I encountered – the ones you can’t help but root for no matter what – are just fun, plain and simple.\n\nI’ll bet you can’t sit through 10 minutes of [“Noun’o’clock” in the Noun Square](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock) without cracking a smile. These daily Twitter spaces commentary treats the conclusion of each live NFT auction like a sporting event, complete with wacky sound effects, and witty banter as the group follows along in real time watching potential new Noun NFTs get randomly generated.\n\n(Think a bunch of people shouting at once, things like: *“This one’s a messy design but I like it.” “I like the bonsai but not with that shirt.” “The sunglasses flamingo?! Come on!” “I’m still thinking about that pineapple.”)*\n\n![Part of “Noun’o’clock” includes a social engagement tactic called “Fomo Nouns” where randomized Nouns appear (like this flamingo-headed avatar) and participants quickly vote on which one to mint. (via: https://fomonouns.wtf/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/POMIHo6rT-HoDaa2Bz5M4.png?height=1112&width=1434)\n\nWhen I attended DevConnect earlier this year, I sat down with the core contributors behind [dfdao](http://www.dfdao.xyz/), the DAO that came together to collectively compete in the game, Dark Forest. As a non-gamer, I was stuck on one question: *“Why?”* Why did you dedicate time away from your full-time jobs to compete at a world-building game with anons all over the world? Why were you compelled to make sure you had always had someone to operate as a “pilot” to execute game play around the clock, every five minutes, for a week straight?\n\nIt didn’t click until I sat through a presentation from Ivan at 0xPARC about Dark Forest. When discussing community engagement in their game, he paused to talk about how dfdao had exposed a vulnerability that let them directly target an opponent and drain all of the resources from their planet. When he showed what this looked like in the universal map ([slide 32 in his deck here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u1nBl5Lu9q24j9pX5B9fyhwNSyZGK58nVbEoe8rNJIk/edit#slide=id.g124c1af0a63_1_103)), I watched the dfdao team proudly grin at each other ear-to-ear, audibly cackling about their cheeky path to victory. That’s when it finally hit me: To them, it’s all just play. And they are having the time of their lives.\n\nThe most fun I had on the Internet last year was watching the livestream of the Sotheby’s auction for the U.S. Constitution. The chat, Discord, and Twitter were simultaneously flooded by [memes](https://twitter.com/laurenlself/status/1459341510655180803) and [inside jokes](https://twitter.com/pseudotheos/status/1461348482401255445) and [speculation](https://twitter.com/abcoathup/status/1461495987298471942). And even when we learned we lost the bid – when the stated goal of the project failed to come to pass – the community pressed on. [This interview](https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution) with Jonah Erlich, a core ConstitutionDAO contributor, highlighted it best:\n\n> ***“Do you have a sense of why people are building a secondary market for this \\[$PEOPLE\\] token?”***\n>\n> *“People like the memes.”*\\*\n>\n> **“You think that’s it?”**\n>\n> *Yeah. People like the memes; they like to have fun. I think that one thing that I’ve learned from exploring the crypto world is that it’s very hard to rationalize a lot of the different momentums — things that happen with memes and with the memetic transfer of information. I think if people are having fun and they’re doing their thing, then I don’t try to interpret it too deeply, because I’m just going to break my brain.”*\n\nSometimes, you must throw away rationality and [“seize the memes of production.”](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1434785416536854529?lang=en)\n\n![Nicholas Cage was the star of the show for much of the meme-culture that existed around the ConstitutionDAO marketing strategy.

(Except for possibly, Uniswap, which towers above the rest as the [most beloved blockchain-enabled app](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLJvPOvibcCUpJ9ES44_cdoX5Hb7LpDaloGWz5FbUEM/edit#slide=id.gea6e71d04f_0_95). That is, at least, for now.) If web2 volatility has taught us anything, it’s that the project that can’t pivot is the project that will fail. Adaptability is key to success.\n\n## \\[wrap-up\\]\n\nSuffice it to say, a lot has happened over the past two years. The bull market run-up leading up through late 2021 crowded a lot of these spaces and communities with more energy than web3 has ever seen before – and through that saturation of energy, we witnessed an immense degree of experimentation & iteration. While temperatures have cooled somewhat in the recent macroeconomic environment and slow-down, we find ourselves at an interesting inflection point, one which allows us to take stock, dig a little deeper, and catch our bearings to direct our attention in more deliberate, intentional ways for the next phase of the crypto adoption curve.\n\nAs of yet, there is still no clear-cut winner – no single company or project who has “solved” decentralization completely (if that’s even the objective). But it is exciting to see some early patterns and behaviors emerge, ones that might guide the next generation of builders and creators (maybe including you).\n\nI invite you to continue this project with me through both exploring & contributing to the library of resources I used along the way.\n\nI’ll be releasing the rest of these individual stories on a weekly cadence [here on Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/bethanymarz.eth).

In a crypto-native, [ownership-first era](https://variant.fund/writing/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software), users are opting to spend their time in digital places that offer not just a better user experience, but more autonomy and influence, more economic incentives, more connection, and ultimately, more fun.\n\nAs a result, from the moment a new crypto-native project idea takes hold, questions of community emerge almost immediately. It begs the question: ***“As a founder or builder in web3, what do you need to know about integrating community into your project? And what does this look like in a decentralized way?”***\n\nPrior to 2020, I’d spent a lot of time analyzing the ins and outs of centralized community-building best practices, largely from the examples of successful web2 networks that I got to know as a user (Foursquare, Meetup, Twitter), as an employee (Stack Overflow), or through osmosis during my time at Union Square Ventures. Last fall, I synthesized many of my [web2 community-building observations into a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HG21WQJ1J7WzfaRuaLOhbKOKiGLAoeUZ5mY8jS6V9PE/edit#slide=id.p) that drew a few parallels (and a lot of open-ended questions) about what those lessons might mean in a web3 world.\n\nBut when I started working a little more closely with a web3 builder community, called [Zeitgeist](https://mirror.xyz/zeitgeistxyz.eth), I realized that the questions founders were asking were much more acute.\n\n1. **How do we get started?**\n2. **How do we decentralize how work gets done?**\n3. **How do we convert people from awareness to participants to builders?**\n4. **How do we measure success?**\n\nTo address these questions, I began to explore the best practices from a wide range of decentralized projects, ranging from NFT networks and crowd-funding platforms to games and DeFi. **The goal of this post is to distill this research into key insights, with a target audience of both web3 builders and crypto-curious entrepreneurs.**\n\n## \\[the projects\\]\n\nDrawing on advice from community members in many of these spaces, I explored 12 projects, with an eye toward better understanding best practices among crypto-native communities.

Strategize second.\n\nOne of the strongest tenets of web3 (or at least the phase of the adoption curve we find ourselves in today) is a culture of building *before* planning. John at CabinDAO quite literally built cabins without knowing how he wanted to use them. A builder saw a [Tweet containing an idea for a new app called “Partybid”](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1383238473767813125?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1383238473767813125%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd.mirror.xyz%2FFLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) and [decided to spend his weekend coding up a v1](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1384372491053846531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1384372491053846531%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd.mirror.xyz%2FFLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4). There’s an authenticity in doing something “just because” that gives credence to these early cycles.\\*\\*\n\nThis *“don’t think, just do”* approach seems to be particularly true among some of the standout DAOs that began on pure adrenaline and “good vibes.” I’m thinking in particular of SharkDAO, which started with the idea that people wanted to collectively bid on Nouns NFTs, and ConstitutionDAO, which spun up (and spun down) in a single week in their quest to purchase a copy of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAmusingly, in this [Verge article about the ConstitutionDAO](https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution), the journalist kept pushing on what was going to happen *after* they bought the U.S. Constitution, asking pragmatic questions like: *“Where would it reside? Who would take care of it?”* The reality is: That wasn’t *really* the point. At least, not right away. The most innovative projects I’ve gotten to know in web3 didn’t start with strategy – they started with *possibility*.\n\n### Sell the dream.\n\nNo matter how crypto-native and digital-first your project may be, your end users are still human (even if they embrace pfps and pseudonyms), and the quickest projects to gain traction are ones that lean into basic human psychology. I noticed four key motivators that galvanized people to jump on board with a new project or initiative. (Which, notably have clear parallels with some of the early traction moments in the world of web2.)\n\n1. **“You’ll be the first.”**\n\n   As one of the first DeFi projects to DAO-ify, [Index Coop](https://indexcoop.com/) fully [decentralized their governance](https://medium.com/indexcoop/introducing-the-index-cooperative-a4eaaf0bcfe2) at a time when the rest of us were still trying to remember what that three-letter acronym stood for. As a result, in addition to unlocking a network of early DeFi evangelists, they also attracted best-in-class community builders, who quite literally quit their day jobs to come up with [guiding principles](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coops-guiding-principles/346) and [new org design concepts](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coop-org-chart/1462) to experiment with a brand new way of working and collaborating. There’s a real benefit to the first-mover advantage.\n2. **“You’ll join an incredible community (of builders).”**\n\n   This is no secret to web3, but it bears repeating: People want to work with great people. Period. Today this largely manifests as developers wanting to build together – which is a large part of the driving action behind the strength of the contributor communities behind Juicebox and PartyBid, or why securing a place on the [Dark Forest leaderboard](https://zkga.me/) holds the equivalent of [Stack Overflow reputation points](https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation) in a web3 era. One of Juicebox’s core contributors, [Jango](https://twitter.com/me_jango), put it best – [“devs like to dev with other devs.”](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/year-of-the-dev/)\n\n   But it’s also apparent in non-developer networks such as CabinDAO, Crypto Coven, and Mirror. In particular, Mirror’s innovative approach to bootstrapping community through the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) brought in high-quality new writers at a manageable, consistent pace. In fact, *every single web3 community* I explored referred to the caliber of the people in their network. Figure out what “that special thing” is for your community, and harness it to attract more like-minded community members.\n3. **“You’ll push the boundaries of what’s possible.”**\n\n   In one of the more clever twists of incentive structure that meets organizational objectives, the game [Dark Forest](https://blog.zkga.me/) was literally built to be broken. The only way to win this world-building and planet-claiming on-chain game is to code your way through automations to streamline your gameplay experience. The foundation that funds the game (among other projects), [0xPARC](https://0xparc.org/about), has a mission to promote application-level innovation on Ethereum. Their open approach to competitive game design has attracted some of the most serious Solidity developers as game players, all excited about the opportunity to push the limits of their code.\n4. **You’ll make money.**\n\n   I’ll spare you the full-on “gold rush” analogy, but you can’t deny the power of the potential upside. In an ownership-first platform, incentives are more important than ever – the trick is getting the balance right. While you don’t need to look far to see how NFT projects drive in “community” through price-gouging, rug pulls, and other cheap tricks, examples of utility-based incentives are much more compelling in the long term. Uniswap’s [model for liquidity providers (now in v3)](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5391541-provide-liquidity-on-uniswap-v3) is a continual iterative effort to educate, incentivize, and empower this core audience segment to their platform. Numerai, which incentivizes data scientists to contribute successful models to their [decentralized hedge fund](https://numer.ai/), amended their incentive structure to reward contributions to their meta model vs. based on individual payouts. The most important advice I received here was simple: Your incentive design must be based around the type of engagement you want. (Easier said than done.)\n\n![Making the “top 10” on the leaderboard for the game, Dark Forest, is just about one of the highest honors you can achieve as a Solidity developer today. (via: https://zkga.me/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kcDA98wo48aG4xtVekWD0.png?height=1228&width=1008)\n\n### Your core team (still) matters more than ever.\n\nWhether you call them founders, builders, or core contributors, the sentiment remains the same. Four of the projects I analyzed can attribute at least part of their initial traction phase to the fact that their core team was previously known or trusted in the space. Like it or not, people with an audience and brand are more likely to galvanize community and early traction.\n\nSee: [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/), started by [Dom](https://twitter.com/dhof), creator of Vine, and [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/), whose core team of Nounders not only also included Dom but other heavy-hitters like the artist [@gremplin](https://twitter.com/gremplin) and [@punk4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156), a prominent thinker and investor. Just like in other industries, smart people tend to pop up again in other smart projects. The more people and projects I spent time with, the more I found intersections and cross-project participation as the norm. Look no further than [Partybid](https://www.partybid.app/)’s origin story, which [literally began as an idea in a single tweet](https://party.mirror.xyz/NHMOTjy3j3EB21GTpWYH3CrMFD2k4WKTB3EpM1dkACc) from Denis Nazarov, former founder and [a16z](https://a16z.com/) crypto partner – not to mention the founder of [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), another successful web3 project. One other big benefit of trusted early builders? It’s a surefire way of guaranteeing that the [“first follower” effect](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbooksauthors/2018/04/11/the-forgotten-first-follower/) attracts a high-caliber network of secondary builders and contributors.\n\n**BEWARE OF: Speculation & Frenzy**\n\nNearly everyone in web3 knows someone who made the right move at the right time and walked away with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of dollars in the bank. Even among the most well-intentioned of projects, you may end up with YouTubers talking about how [Helium is a “magic box to earn you thousands of dollars”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KG-5SnXCTA) or that Loot bags containing Divine Robes [merit selling for as much as 250 ETH](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xff9c1b15b16263c61d017ee9f65c50e4ae0113d7/748). But the spikey viral peaks of growth (and people seeking profits) actually dilute the community. It can be hard to avoid but still noteworthy to mention. [Optimism’s airdrop earlier this year](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/) serves as an early example of a project at staving off arbitrage efforts, but there’s still work to be done. There’s something to be said for the bear market we’re in: Despite people objectively losing money, it does provide an opportunity for building over speculation.\n\n## \\[2: decentralizing how work gets done\\]\n\n![Protocol improvement proposals, a process for suggesting changes to the platform or project, are often voted upon in Snapshot, as is the case with Uniswap’s governance process. (via https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6jshYP1cw5vcJf4ahSOOw.png?height=1322&width=2144&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nOnce you’ve started a web3 community, you’ll probably start wondering how much to empower the community – both in decision-making and how that work is executed. While most web3 projects look at *how decisions get made* as the determining factor around its state of decentralization, an [emergent theory from Spencer Graham](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/tGT32p-lA__63rmTXq_OD_iTTDoK-vsUn3QVsnnWmvo) suggests that the purest form should include both decentralized decision-making *and* decentralized execution. In other words: ***“How ‘decentralized’ are you, really?”***\n\nThroughout my research, I’ve ranked each project against a 5-point scale – *the “decentralization spectrum” –* ranging from fully decentralized to fully centralized.\n\n### Decentralization Spectrum\n\nFully Decentralized **⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AQNhAAeQ2o86-bNcGpHwEiJiyeMqhVa0onUZBMxPNaw/edit#slide=id.p) ⬤ ⬤** Fully Centralized\n\nYou’ll notice that, at least among this subset of arguably well-known projects, “pure decentralization” (all decisions & actions are taken in a decentralized way) is the outlier, not the norm. And very few start as fully decentralized, with the exception of Bitcoin itself, and possibly also Loot. The vast majority fall somewhere in the middle.\n\n![The Decentralization Spectrum is a 5-point scale approximation of the relative level of decentralization for any project, based on how decisions and work is accomplished.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pZxLlcQ3ZTZ6lwF_Lfl02.png?height=540&width=960)\n\n### Share transparent and public documentation.\n\nIt’s no secret that web3 projects build in public. With open Discord servers, Twitter threads, public-facing governance forums, and voting through Snapshot, nearly every project has a wide degree of open, transparent documentation to their users and community.\n\n**But – Just because something exists on the open web does *not* mean it is equally accessible to all.** I first started this project intending to do wholly independent solo research into each web3 community. But I quickly discovered this was not sustainable. As a newcomer to all of these spaces, it took me *hours* of time to untangle the [sometimes cryptic websites](https://zkga.me/), dozens of pages of documentation, and decipher the meaning behind each Discord server’s channel names.\n\nIn web2, we attributed broad developer adoption of new technology due in part to a product’s ease of API access and documentation. In web3, we look at their Notion pages, Discord groups, and onboarding flow. A couple of examples stand out here right away in terms of their level of accessibility and robustness of their materials: Index Coop, both in terms of its [new member onboarding](https://onboarding.catapultlabs.xyz/indexcoop) and [handbook](https://docs.indexcoop.com/); and Juicebox for their [Notion](https://info.juicebox.money/), built with both project creators and developers in mind. An honorable mention goes to NFT project Crypto Coven for their [community-generated public Library](https://cryptocoven.notion.site/cryptocoven/98e0b55d3c2c415bb0bdbb78f68be4a0?v=8f8de19db6484e4b85727c4ef1a5c925), which aggregates both stories of the “lore” surrounding their network and also the basics of DAOs and web3.\n\n![Index Coop’s public community handbook is among the most well-documented and transparent projects for their existing and prospective community members. (via: https://docs.indexcoop.com/) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I0XjJVI2HNx-COhFrl-rM.png?height=1224&width=2536)\n\n### Give your community a voice separate from the core build.\n\nPerhaps one of the most noteworthy trends in decentralized community management is the separation of the community’s influence from that of the core builders. Helium and Uniswap offered the strongest examples of this “church and state” effect in their decision-making frameworks. Both are equipped with a C-corp of core builders and team members and also a non-profit entity (or foundation), which is community-managed.\n\nIn Uniswap’s case, their core team Uniswap Labs owns the product (which includes the web app interface, the widget, and any other products they may roll out), but Uniswap the DAO owns the protocol. Decisions about the protocol are managed through a foundation and government through their open [governance proposal process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732). As one example of how this plays out, the recent decision to deploy v3 of Uniswap can be tracked all the way back to conversations that began in March and followed the four steps in their governance: a [Temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-uniswap-x-celo-green-pool-for-treasury-proposal/16428), a [Consensus check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-uniswap-x-celo-green-pool-for-treasury-proposal/16458), and a [Governance proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-celo/16686), ultimately leading to the [successful deployment](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-v3-deployed-on-celo/17091) on July 13.\n\nHelium is one of many projects that leverages a proposal process to manage requested changes to their protocol, called [HIPs](https://github.com/helium/HIP). (Other examples include [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://eips.ethereum.org/)” (EIPs), and similar processes at [Zcash](https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/main/zip-0000.rst) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).) Managed through Github, these changes are then routed to the core team at Helium, Inc., where most of the core devs of the Helium blockchain are employed. Both of these examples strike a mid-point balance of how to both leverage community engagement and recommendations while still allowing some degree of agility and nimble-ness from a core team.\n\n### Start with an incomplete build.\n\nOne interesting tendency among some web3 projects is to intentionally start with “incomplete builds.” A deck of Loot bags dropping as an NFT collection inspired dozens of side projects, teams, and builders to corral around the “player’s deck” and build out the world with additional elements: [Maps](https://opensea.io/collection/crypts-and-caverns), [Realms](https://scroll.bibliothecadao.xyz/docs/game/realms), [HyperLoot Characters](https://hyperlootproject.com/). A 100% creative commons collection of NFTs called Nouns beacons a new wave of [designers](https://nounstown.wtf/), [animators](https://hackmd.io/@elrgoLkbTcaX3edoqOHuQQ/nouns-the-animated-series), and [storytellers](https://nouns.wtf/vote/83) to contribute to this emergent ecosystem. Dark Forest’s decentralized world-building game was made to be exploited – actively encouraging developers to build plug-ins, integrations, and other boundary-pushing gameplay tactics – even when this sometimes meant [acknowledging when things went a little too far](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1510658041473024010). Each of these projects, and many more in the space, serve as magnets in the way they playfulness and collaboration from a community that not only decides what comes next, but also builds it themselves.\n\nIn each of these examples (arguably the most truly decentralized projects I explored), getting the starting conditions right is more important than ever. [Sina Habibian](https://twitter.com/sinahab) who advises web3 builders in the community Zeitgeist said:\n\n> *“I think being thoughtful/intentional about the initial conditions actually matters more when launching a truly decentralized project (like Loot and Nouns). That's because the core team (if a core team even exists) can't course correct as easily after the fact. There is a strong inertia to the initial choices that influences the direction the community/project evolves.”*\n\n![Loot bags, which you can buy on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, simply contain eight lines of text with randomized items, objects, and gear. What becomes of these “trading cards” is up to the community to decide. (via: https://opensea.io/collection/lootproject)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EFSHPVSzFcIMxSjz2j3Te.png?height=880&width=1862)\n\n### Consider an intermediate layer of community leadership\n\nNearly every DAO I spoke with had some additional layer of community leadership to help manage their broader network. While the obvious thought may be to simply assign Discord permissions to server members who step up, authentic design for community ambassador programs stems much more organically. Index Coop uses something called “Owl Levels” to designate different levels of seniority in the community (Gold, Silver and Bronze, each with a vote weighting around them). Numerai elected a “Council of Elders” of senior community members who could make decisions more quickly on behalf of the broader network. Creator Cabins has a “City Council” composed of people with at least 500 $CABIN. These designations seem to serve as an extension from common web2 community-building models such as “developer evangelists,” “influencers,” or even just “brand ambassadors” in that they harbor not only titles and perks, but also some influence and authority.\n\n**BEWARE OF: The temptation to turn everything into a community vote.**\n\nProlific web3 community thought leader, [@rafathebuilder](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder), who has engaged in communities including Creator Cabins and Mirror observed:\n\n> *\"I think there’s a thing of “minimum required decentralization” — there are real trade-offs. Many organizations need to sacrifice efficiency and build decentralization through slow, organic growth. If you’re aiming for decentralization, you’re not aiming to make it cheap. You’re not optimizing on cost to production, you’re optimizing on the resiliency of the network.\"*\n\nOne of the most thoughtful essays I read on this topic came from Jon Hills at CabinDAO: *[How Decentralized Organizations Win (And Lose).](https://creators.mirror.xyz/6-iNptibzKNrQaZJR_ufiMkLQvj5mgpFYueWFKu9agU)* In this piece, Jon challenges the notion of “decentralized absolutism” and identifies principles from four (non-crypto-native) organizations that flexibly adapt around the needs of their community, without offering 100% of the power to the people. This tension is one that many crypto-native builders will need to reconcile with among their own projects and protocols – both the opportunities and challenges involved.\n\n## \\[3: converting people into participants into builders\\]\n\n![Despite the digital-first nature of web3, community is core to the ethos of builders in the space; at the Devconnect conference in Amsterdam earlier this year, a pop-up coworking space accommodated 500+ people at once. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fFvx0foJhuJDJz-uxaJ3W.png?height=3024&width=4032&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nIn an ownership economy, the active participation of members in web3 communities matters as much as users matter in web2. Many builders and founders are asking: **“What’s the web3 conversion funnel? How do I get people to go from an idle observer to a community member to an active participant in my project?”** While there’s no magic wand answer to this question (just as there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to classic marketing funnel activities in web2), here are a few observations (and one misconception) I observed from the projects in my research.\n\n### Know who your audience is (and who it isn’t).\n\nThe strongest web3 communities I encountered had absolutely no qualms about acknowledging who exactly they were targeting. Crypto Coven perhaps nails this most of all – going after “femme” culture in web3 and positioning themselves as the “anti crypto bro” culture. From the moment you [land on their website](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/), you’re transported into a different place – one of witchy language, folklore, premonitions and prophecies.\n\nWhile you might start out, as Crypto Coven’s team of “High Witches” did, intentionally targeting an audience for your project, it’s far more common for teams to discover this organically. Such was the case for Index Coop, whose audience of DeFi evangelists emerged slowly, [with each new product](https://indexcoop.com/products) that launched. With each additional product launch, a new sub-community niche emerges on Index, with each contributing in its own way to the DAO.\n\nBy contrast, Helium, a project [originally founded as an IoT company in 2013](https://blog.helium.com/welcome-to-heliums-decentralized-machine-network-2e7b0801da44), has a very high rate of brand-new-to-crypto people — for many of them, Helium is the only crypto project they’re involved in, which has influenced the flavor of community organizing in a lot of ways. These severe audience differences are also what make it impossible to define one universal approach to community.\n\n![From the second you land on Crypto Coven’s website, you know you’ve entered another world entirely. This self-selecting mechanism helps them serve as a magnet for the audience that would most align with their community. (via: https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/lore) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/On8CtKMMGb-lVAB2gk-W5.png?height=1072&width=2170)\n\n### Recognize that your most passionate community-members are willing to work for free\n\nI used to believe that most of the power in web3 existed in the inherent incentive structure for every community action taken. Whether you pick up a bounty, refer a new collaborator, or contribute in some other way, I was under the impression that all actions received some incentive or compensation as reward.\n\nBut the more I unfolded the layers of these communities that I spoke with, the more I learned that incentives are a bit of a “squishy” area – even in web3. For one, hundreds of people donated to CabinDAO’s original mission – to fund creative retreats for emerging artists – without personally benefiting from that outcome. The 17,000 people who contributed to ConstitutionDAO’s insane crowdfund campaign did so as a mere curiosity, with zero expectation of a return on that investment. But people aren’t just willing to donate money; they also donate time. Danny Aranda, now a core contributor at PartyDAO, started just as any other community participant. He said:\n\n> *\"I was a DAO member like anyone else. I started working on the project pretty organically and pretty unpaid. There was a governance proposal that we should start paying Danny, and then there was more work, and I started getting paid full time.\"*\n\nDanny’s use case is a particularly good example of how projects can assess project-market fit among their community: If people are willing to work for free (at least initially), you’ve found your hook.\n\n[In a survey of 400+ DAO members that Gitcoin conducted](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLJvPOvibcCUpJ9ES44_cdoX5Hb7LpDaloGWz5FbUEM/edit#slide=id.gea346d7c21_1_101), roughly half of respondents reported that DAOs are *not* their primary source of income. (Interestingly, this is the same percent of people who reported having at least 12 months of savings, so the relative financial security of DAO contributors may contribute toward their earnestness to take on unpaid work.) And my favorite example was learning that the [“Council of Elders”](https://twitter.com/NumeraiCoE) at Numerai also isn’t exactly paid to do that work – but the reputation of being an Elder stands on its own, and they did gift them cloaks, which the team excitedly wore in solidarity at IRL conferences together.\n\n**To be clear: I’m not suggesting that you *stop* paying your community members for their hard work and labor.** Most of these projects made it quite clear to me that there are thresholds of free work to bounty-based work and ultimately to full time, paid work. I’m simply noting that – even in the hyper-tokenized world of web3, sometimes you can get great people to do great things by just buying them some cool-looking cloaks.\n\n![Numerai consistently seeks out opportunities to reward contributors to their project in unique ways, including through this recent campaign giving away free “NFTees.” (via: https://twitter.com/NumeraiCoE/status/1547243673519214593)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6pcv3qkJ5QPFr1GZnwjrs.png?height=1202&width=1094)\n\n### Focus on a small core team of builders and a broad team of evangelists\n\nTo the outside observer, Discord server size serves as a false flag measurement of true engagement. Even for projects with Discord communities in the tens of thousands (Uniswap) or hundreds of thousands (Helium), the relative size of the contributing team is small by comparison. As a project leader, there’s a serious temptation to get sucked into the groundswell of needs, requests, ideas and suggestions from these bottomless communities. But a more disciplined, constraint-based approach to growth can help you stay focused on the North Star for your community. For most projects, the percent of community members who are also core contributors or builders is much smaller than you may think.\n\nThe best example of a strategic and intentional rollout of a product-led community strategy is through Mirror’s [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race). For more than six months, Mirror invited writers to submit content for that week’s competition, and token holders voted to admit 10 new members each week. These new members quickly became early adopters, finding kinship not only in a peer community of high-quality writers but also informing future product & protocol development for Mirror’s core team.\n\nFinally, I’ll note that some DAOs – and many NFT projects – are quick to pick out one simple, easy way for their broad base of members to serve as evangelists. This might be actively encouraging members to rock their swag ([like Bored Apes),](https://www.boredapewear.com/) funding projects that also promote brand awareness ([like Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/vote/95)) or even actively engaging on Twitter through memes and pfps. One of the main reasons that I chose Crypto Coven as an NFT project to dive into for this research was due to the intense degree of community outreach I received from the network of Witches in [my initial Twitter inquiry about community research](https://twitter.com/bethanymarz/status/1506356530614087688).\n\n![Splashy partnerships and hype installations, such as this Bored Apes inflatable as part of NFT NYC week are a popular tactic to drive brand awareness among web3 communities. (via: https://www.wsj.com/articles/marketers-at-nft-nyc-upbeat-on-brand-building-in-the-metaverse-11656324000)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PGRQr8lBFkYKgpx7r4hG0.jpeg?height=1146&width=1720)\n\n**BEWARE OF: Facilitating chatter vs. true community engagement.**\n\nIt would be a mistake to go through the motions of community, or simply follow suit to “run the playbook” of another DAO or crypto-native project. [Conway Anderson](https://twitter.com/ConwayAnderson), web3 builder and early Loot adopter has observed this in many networks he has been a part of. He said:\n\n> *“Nothing happens if you just create a Discord and put people there. Nobody really knows what they want to do. The best DAOs / products in the space have usually been a group of people who execute and through that, the broader community starts to go, “What if…?” There’s usually a certain threshold where other people start to come in.”*\n\nPart of achieving this level of engagement involves leaning into the parts of your project that are uniquely web3 – and legitimately wouldn’t be possible to build in web2 structures. Rafa noted:\n\n> *“I think that the reason why web3 feels special is because many protocols weren’t public infrastructure before web3, they were private infrastructure. It’s really hard to build a community around private infrastructure that’s more than just a “fan base” (like Apple). But it’s much harder to maintain that community when it comes to private infrastructure. Today's opportunity to unlock the power of evangelism is of a different magnitude. You have so much connectivity; you can tailor your message, do automatic translations, crowdfunds, anyone can send anyone money or pool resources together.”*\n\n## \\[4: measuring success\\]\n\n![Every community defines success differently. SharkDAO’s mission is to pool together resources to buy Nouns, and ultimately help people find their way into the Nouns NFT ecosystem.

But in this research, I encountered a few grounding principles that seemed to help some projects identify their True North, keep up the momentum, and galvanize ongoing community engagement. Here’s what that looks like in practice.\n\n### Decide whether you’re building infrastructure, or providing engagement.\n\nFirst – identify your True North Star. Some of the best advice I received during this project came from learning about [Rafa](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder)’s distinction in building infrastructure vs. engagements. In a real-world example, he challenged me to consider the way that you might cultivate community in a neighborhood. **One option is to build infrastructure – parks, churches, community centers – and let people organically self-organize. The alternative is to design activities – block parties, game nights, town meetings – and engage people around events.**\n\nAs a web3 project leader – there’s a clear choice to make. You can build a community around your protocol (such as how Helium, Mirror, and Uniswap have done), or you can offer event-based programming designed to keep your community members coming back. (The latter is not only the case for most NFT projects but also for the myriad of DAOs, learning communities, and other decentralized, member-based networks in web3 today.) While this choice isn’t necessarily a binary one, it is something you should formulate a thesis around for your particular project.\n\n### Have a bias to action.\n\nSecond – the web3 equivalent of “move fast and break things” – Say “yes” to new partnerships and opportunities. This happens in real time, all the time: A new connection at a conference becomes an NFT artist for your next project; an errant message on Twitter or Telegram blossoms into a new Discord and a game plan to bid on the U.S. Constitution with a DAO. Due to the quick cycles of experimentation and iteration necessary for this new era, saving some space to say yes to more spontaneous opportunities (and being open-minded about what those might be) is just about one of the best decisions you can make.A few examples: CabinDAO didn’t start as a DAO. Their founder Jon hosted a group of friends for a soft launch at his initial properties once they were completed, and one of the attendees spoke about the opportunity to use crypto to scale the creator co-op that they had all been working on together. Both of the early projects that gave Juicebox their initial traction came from their core contributor Jango jumping right into two fast-moving hype projects (SharkDAO and ConstitutionDAO) – volunteering their product as the means to make it possible. It matters less if you are ready: What matters is that you are there.\n\n### Invite your community to play.\n\nThird – make it irresistible to walk away. Let’s be honest: There’s a lot of “un-fun” things about the world today. It’s easy to forget how delightful it feels to have a good laugh or take on something *totally ridiculous* with strangers on the Internet. But some of the stickiest projects I encountered – the ones you can’t help but root for no matter what – are just fun, plain and simple.\n\nI’ll bet you can’t sit through 10 minutes of [“Noun’o’clock” in the Noun Square](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock) without cracking a smile. These daily Twitter spaces commentary treats the conclusion of each live NFT auction like a sporting event, complete with wacky sound effects, and witty banter as the group follows along in real time watching potential new Noun NFTs get randomly generated.\n\n(Think a bunch of people shouting at once, things like: *“This one’s a messy design but I like it.” “I like the bonsai but not with that shirt.” “The sunglasses flamingo?! Come on!” “I’m still thinking about that pineapple.”)*\n\n![Part of “Noun’o’clock” includes a social engagement tactic called “Fomo Nouns” where randomized Nouns appear (like this flamingo-headed avatar) and participants quickly vote on which one to mint. (via: https://fomonouns.wtf/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/POMIHo6rT-HoDaa2Bz5M4.png?height=1112&width=1434)\n\nWhen I attended DevConnect earlier this year, I sat down with the core contributors behind [dfdao](http://www.dfdao.xyz/), the DAO that came together to collectively compete in the game, Dark Forest. As a non-gamer, I was stuck on one question: *“Why?”* Why did you dedicate time away from your full-time jobs to compete at a world-building game with anons all over the world? Why were you compelled to make sure you had always had someone to operate as a “pilot” to execute game play around the clock, every five minutes, for a week straight?\n\nIt didn’t click until I sat through a presentation from Ivan at 0xPARC about Dark Forest. When discussing community engagement in their game, he paused to talk about how dfdao had exposed a vulnerability that let them directly target an opponent and drain all of the resources from their planet. When he showed what this looked like in the universal map ([slide 32 in his deck here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u1nBl5Lu9q24j9pX5B9fyhwNSyZGK58nVbEoe8rNJIk/edit#slide=id.g124c1af0a63_1_103)), I watched the dfdao team proudly grin at each other ear-to-ear, audibly cackling about their cheeky path to victory. That’s when it finally hit me: To them, it’s all just play. And they are having the time of their lives.\n\nThe most fun I had on the Internet last year was watching the livestream of the Sotheby’s auction for the U.S. Constitution. The chat, Discord, and Twitter were simultaneously flooded by [memes](https://twitter.com/laurenlself/status/1459341510655180803) and [inside jokes](https://twitter.com/pseudotheos/status/1461348482401255445) and [speculation](https://twitter.com/abcoathup/status/1461495987298471942). And even when we learned we lost the bid – when the stated goal of the project failed to come to pass – the community pressed on. [This interview](https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution) with Jonah Erlich, a core ConstitutionDAO contributor, highlighted it best:\n\n> ***“Do you have a sense of why people are building a secondary market for this \\[$PEOPLE\\] token?”***\n>\n> *“People like the memes.”*\\*\n>\n> **“You think that’s it?”**\n>\n> *Yeah. People like the memes; they like to have fun. I think that one thing that I’ve learned from exploring the crypto world is that it’s very hard to rationalize a lot of the different momentums — things that happen with memes and with the memetic transfer of information. I think if people are having fun and they’re doing their thing, then I don’t try to interpret it too deeply, because I’m just going to break my brain.”*\n\nSometimes, you must throw away rationality and [“seize the memes of production.”](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1434785416536854529?lang=en)\n\n![Nicholas Cage was the star of the show for much of the meme-culture that existed around the ConstitutionDAO marketing strategy.

(Except for possibly, Uniswap, which towers above the rest as the [most beloved blockchain-enabled app](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLJvPOvibcCUpJ9ES44_cdoX5Hb7LpDaloGWz5FbUEM/edit#slide=id.gea6e71d04f_0_95). That is, at least, for now.) If web2 volatility has taught us anything, it’s that the project that can’t pivot is the project that will fail. Adaptability is key to success.\n\n## \\[wrap-up\\]\n\nSuffice it to say, a lot has happened over the past two years. The bull market run-up leading up through late 2021 crowded a lot of these spaces and communities with more energy than web3 has ever seen before – and through that saturation of energy, we witnessed an immense degree of experimentation & iteration. While temperatures have cooled somewhat in the recent macroeconomic environment and slow-down, we find ourselves at an interesting inflection point, one which allows us to take stock, dig a little deeper, and catch our bearings to direct our attention in more deliberate, intentional ways for the next phase of the crypto adoption curve.\n\nAs of yet, there is still no clear-cut winner – no single company or project who has “solved” decentralization completely (if that’s even the objective). But it is exciting to see some early patterns and behaviors emerge, ones that might guide the next generation of builders and creators (maybe including you).\n\nI invite you to continue this project with me through both exploring & contributing to the library of resources I used along the way.\n\nI’ll be releasing the rest of these individual stories on a weekly cadence [here on Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/bethanymarz.eth).

In a crypto-native, [ownership-first era](https://variant.fund/writing/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software), users are opting to spend their time in digital places that offer not just a better user experience, but more autonomy and influence, more economic incentives, more connection, and ultimately, more fun.\n\nAs a result, from the moment a new crypto-native project idea takes hold, questions of community emerge almost immediately. It begs the question: ***“As a founder or builder in web3, what do you need to know about integrating community into your project? And what does this look like in a decentralized way?”***\n\nPrior to 2020, I’d spent a lot of time analyzing the ins and outs of centralized community-building best practices, largely from the examples of successful web2 networks that I got to know as a user (Foursquare, Meetup, Twitter), as an employee (Stack Overflow), or through osmosis during my time at Union Square Ventures. Last fall, I synthesized many of my [web2 community-building observations into a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HG21WQJ1J7WzfaRuaLOhbKOKiGLAoeUZ5mY8jS6V9PE/edit#slide=id.p) that drew a few parallels (and a lot of open-ended questions) about what those lessons might mean in a web3 world.\n\nBut when I started working a little more closely with a web3 builder community, called [Zeitgeist](https://mirror.xyz/zeitgeistxyz.eth), I realized that the questions founders were asking were much more acute.\n\n1. **How do we get started?**\n2. **How do we decentralize how work gets done?**\n3. **How do we convert people from awareness to participants to builders?**\n4. **How do we measure success?**\n\nTo address these questions, I began to explore the best practices from a wide range of decentralized projects, ranging from NFT networks and crowd-funding platforms to games and DeFi. **The goal of this post is to distill this research into key insights, with a target audience of both web3 builders and crypto-curious entrepreneurs.**\n\n## \\[the projects\\]\n\nDrawing on advice from community members in many of these spaces, I explored 12 projects, with an eye toward better understanding best practices among crypto-native communities. While I conducted much of the primary research independently, I also spoke with a core contributor at many of these initiatives to validate some of my findings and fill in some blanks.\n\nThey are:\n\n### Crowd-funding DAOs:\n\n* **[PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/)**[ ](https://www.partybid.app/)\n  **Protocol for buying NFTs as a team**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.partybid.app/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n  *[\\[Read the full writeup\\]](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/edit/WKzmZICjcIowNpC7JNICfZJdxhLwC_wn1d8RwPxRK-A)*\n* **[Juicebox](https://www.juicebox.money/)\n  Decentralized funding platform**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.juicebox.money/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Creator Cabins](https://www.creatorcabins.com/)\n  A community of remote cabins for independent online creators**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### DeFi:\n\n* **[Index Coop](https://indexcoop.com/)**\n  **Decentralized investment vehicles for access to crypto tokens**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://indexcoop.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)\n  Decentralized crypto trading protocol**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://uniswap.org/) ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### Gaming:\n\n* **[Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/)\n  Decentralized world-building game**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ [⬤](https://indexcoop.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/)\n  Adventure gear stored on-chain as NFTs**\n  Fully Decentralized [⬤](https://www.lootproject.com/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### NFTs:\n\n* **[Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/)**[\n  ](https://nouns.wtf/)**Creative commons community of on-chain avatars**\n  Fully Decentralized [⬤](https://nouns.wtf/) ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Crypto Coven](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/)**[\n  ](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/)**Femme-focused crypto community of Witches**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/) ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n### Other Applications:\n\n* **[Helium](https://www.helium.com/)**[\n  ](https://www.helium.com/)**Decentralized wireless infrastructure**\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://www.helium.com/) ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)**[ ](https://mirror.xyz/) \n\n  **Decentralized, on-chain platform for publishing & funding** \n\n  Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://mirror.xyz/) ⬤ Fully Centralized\n* **[Numerai](https://numer.ai/)\n  Decentralized hedge fund built upon a data science tournament**Fully Decentralized ⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://numer.ai/) ⬤ ⬤ Fully Centralized\n\n*\\*If you’re totally new to the space, read these primers first on [DAOs](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-a-dao-and-how-do-they-work/), [DeFi](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/), [NFTs](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq), and [decentralized gaming](https://blog.duelistking.com/explaining-the-concept-of-decentralized-gaming-dfc14fb52b77).*\n\n## \\[the research\\]\n\n**The primary output of this work includes three components:**\n\n1. **This overview** of best practices for web3 founders & builders to keep in mind when asking the question, *“How do I build a decentralized community into my product?”*\n2. **A series of 12 discrete stories,** one for each project I explored, to walk through the timeline of how things got started and where they stand as of today (July 2022).I’ll be dropping these out through my Mirror here for the next month.

Throughout this research, I did my best to unfurl each project to its starting kernel. Here are the web3 specific nuances and observations that emerged:\n\n### Build first. Strategize second.\n\nOne of the strongest tenets of web3 (or at least the phase of the adoption curve we find ourselves in today) is a culture of building *before* planning.

There’s an authenticity in doing something “just because” that gives credence to these early cycles.\\*\\*\n\nThis *“don’t think, just do”* approach seems to be particularly true among some of the standout DAOs that began on pure adrenaline and “good vibes.” I’m thinking in particular of SharkDAO, which started with the idea that people wanted to collectively bid on Nouns NFTs, and ConstitutionDAO, which spun up (and spun down) in a single week in their quest to purchase a copy of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAmusingly, in this [Verge article about the ConstitutionDAO](https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution), the journalist kept pushing on what was going to happen *after* they bought the U.S. Constitution, asking pragmatic questions like: *“Where would it reside? Who would take care of it?”* The reality is: That wasn’t *really* the point. At least, not right away. The most innovative projects I’ve gotten to know in web3 didn’t start with strategy – they started with *possibility*.\n\n### Sell the dream.\n\nNo matter how crypto-native and digital-first your project may be, your end users are still human (even if they embrace pfps and pseudonyms), and the quickest projects to gain traction are ones that lean into basic human psychology. I noticed four key motivators that galvanized people to jump on board with a new project or initiative. (Which, notably have clear parallels with some of the early traction moments in the world of web2.)\n\n1. **“You’ll be the first.”**\n\n   As one of the first DeFi projects to DAO-ify, [Index Coop](https://indexcoop.com/) fully [decentralized their governance](https://medium.com/indexcoop/introducing-the-index-cooperative-a4eaaf0bcfe2) at a time when the rest of us were still trying to remember what that three-letter acronym stood for. As a result, in addition to unlocking a network of early DeFi evangelists, they also attracted best-in-class community builders, who quite literally quit their day jobs to come up with [guiding principles](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coops-guiding-principles/346) and [new org design concepts](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coop-org-chart/1462) to experiment with a brand new way of working and collaborating. There’s a real benefit to the first-mover advantage.\n2. **“You’ll join an incredible community (of builders).”**\n\n   This is no secret to web3, but it bears repeating: People want to work with great people. Period. Today this largely manifests as developers wanting to build together – which is a large part of the driving action behind the strength of the contributor communities behind Juicebox and PartyBid, or why securing a place on the [Dark Forest leaderboard](https://zkga.me/) holds the equivalent of [Stack Overflow reputation points](https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation) in a web3 era. One of Juicebox’s core contributors, [Jango](https://twitter.com/me_jango), put it best – [“devs like to dev with other devs.”](https://info.juicebox.money/blog/year-of-the-dev/)\n\n   But it’s also apparent in non-developer networks such as CabinDAO, Crypto Coven, and Mirror. In particular, Mirror’s innovative approach to bootstrapping community through the [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race) brought in high-quality new writers at a manageable, consistent pace. In fact, *every single web3 community* I explored referred to the caliber of the people in their network. Figure out what “that special thing” is for your community, and harness it to attract more like-minded community members.\n3. **“You’ll push the boundaries of what’s possible.”**\n\n   In one of the more clever twists of incentive structure that meets organizational objectives, the game [Dark Forest](https://blog.zkga.me/) was literally built to be broken. The only way to win this world-building and planet-claiming on-chain game is to code your way through automations to streamline your gameplay experience. The foundation that funds the game (among other projects), [0xPARC](https://0xparc.org/about), has a mission to promote application-level innovation on Ethereum. Their open approach to competitive game design has attracted some of the most serious Solidity developers as game players, all excited about the opportunity to push the limits of their code.\n4. **You’ll make money.**\n\n   I’ll spare you the full-on “gold rush” analogy, but you can’t deny the power of the potential upside. In an ownership-first platform, incentives are more important than ever – the trick is getting the balance right. While you don’t need to look far to see how NFT projects drive in “community” through price-gouging, rug pulls, and other cheap tricks, examples of utility-based incentives are much more compelling in the long term. Uniswap’s [model for liquidity providers (now in v3)](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5391541-provide-liquidity-on-uniswap-v3) is a continual iterative effort to educate, incentivize, and empower this core audience segment to their platform. Numerai, which incentivizes data scientists to contribute successful models to their [decentralized hedge fund](https://numer.ai/), amended their incentive structure to reward contributions to their meta model vs. based on individual payouts. The most important advice I received here was simple: Your incentive design must be based around the type of engagement you want. (Easier said than done.)\n\n![Making the “top 10” on the leaderboard for the game, Dark Forest, is just about one of the highest honors you can achieve as a Solidity developer today. (via: https://zkga.me/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kcDA98wo48aG4xtVekWD0.png?height=1228&width=1008)\n\n### Your core team (still) matters more than ever.\n\nWhether you call them founders, builders, or core contributors, the sentiment remains the same. Four of the projects I analyzed can attribute at least part of their initial traction phase to the fact that their core team was previously known or trusted in the space. Like it or not, people with an audience and brand are more likely to galvanize community and early traction.\n\nSee: [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/), started by [Dom](https://twitter.com/dhof), creator of Vine, and [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/), whose core team of Nounders not only also included Dom but other heavy-hitters like the artist [@gremplin](https://twitter.com/gremplin) and [@punk4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156), a prominent thinker and investor. Just like in other industries, smart people tend to pop up again in other smart projects. The more people and projects I spent time with, the more I found intersections and cross-project participation as the norm. Look no further than [Partybid](https://www.partybid.app/)’s origin story, which [literally began as an idea in a single tweet](https://party.mirror.xyz/NHMOTjy3j3EB21GTpWYH3CrMFD2k4WKTB3EpM1dkACc) from Denis Nazarov, former founder and [a16z](https://a16z.com/) crypto partner – not to mention the founder of [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), another successful web3 project. One other big benefit of trusted early builders? It’s a surefire way of guaranteeing that the [“first follower” effect](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbooksauthors/2018/04/11/the-forgotten-first-follower/) attracts a high-caliber network of secondary builders and contributors.\n\n**BEWARE OF: Speculation & Frenzy**\n\nNearly everyone in web3 knows someone who made the right move at the right time and walked away with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of dollars in the bank. Even among the most well-intentioned of projects, you may end up with YouTubers talking about how [Helium is a “magic box to earn you thousands of dollars”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KG-5SnXCTA) or that Loot bags containing Divine Robes [merit selling for as much as 250 ETH](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xff9c1b15b16263c61d017ee9f65c50e4ae0113d7/748). But the spikey viral peaks of growth (and people seeking profits) actually dilute the community. It can be hard to avoid but still noteworthy to mention. [Optimism’s airdrop earlier this year](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/) serves as an early example of a project at staving off arbitrage efforts, but there’s still work to be done. There’s something to be said for the bear market we’re in: Despite people objectively losing money, it does provide an opportunity for building over speculation.\n\n## \\[2: decentralizing how work gets done\\]\n\n![Protocol improvement proposals, a process for suggesting changes to the platform or project, are often voted upon in Snapshot, as is the case with Uniswap’s governance process. (via https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6jshYP1cw5vcJf4ahSOOw.png?height=1322&width=2144&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nOnce you’ve started a web3 community, you’ll probably start wondering how much to empower the community – both in decision-making and how that work is executed. While most web3 projects look at *how decisions get made* as the determining factor around its state of decentralization, an [emergent theory from Spencer Graham](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/tGT32p-lA__63rmTXq_OD_iTTDoK-vsUn3QVsnnWmvo) suggests that the purest form should include both decentralized decision-making *and* decentralized execution. In other words: ***“How ‘decentralized’ are you, really?”***\n\nThroughout my research, I’ve ranked each project against a 5-point scale – *the “decentralization spectrum” –* ranging from fully decentralized to fully centralized.\n\n### Decentralization Spectrum\n\nFully Decentralized **⬤ ⬤ [⬤](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AQNhAAeQ2o86-bNcGpHwEiJiyeMqhVa0onUZBMxPNaw/edit#slide=id.p) ⬤ ⬤** Fully Centralized\n\nYou’ll notice that, at least among this subset of arguably well-known projects, “pure decentralization” (all decisions & actions are taken in a decentralized way) is the outlier, not the norm. And very few start as fully decentralized, with the exception of Bitcoin itself, and possibly also Loot. The vast majority fall somewhere in the middle.\n\n![The Decentralization Spectrum is a 5-point scale approximation of the relative level of decentralization for any project, based on how decisions and work is accomplished.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pZxLlcQ3ZTZ6lwF_Lfl02.png?height=540&width=960)\n\n### Share transparent and public documentation.\n\nIt’s no secret that web3 projects build in public. With open Discord servers, Twitter threads, public-facing governance forums, and voting through Snapshot, nearly every project has a wide degree of open, transparent documentation to their users and community.\n\n**But – Just because something exists on the open web does *not* mean it is equally accessible to all.** I first started this project intending to do wholly independent solo research into each web3 community. But I quickly discovered this was not sustainable. As a newcomer to all of these spaces, it took me *hours* of time to untangle the [sometimes cryptic websites](https://zkga.me/), dozens of pages of documentation, and decipher the meaning behind each Discord server’s channel names.\n\nIn web2, we attributed broad developer adoption of new technology due in part to a product’s ease of API access and documentation. In web3, we look at their Notion pages, Discord groups, and onboarding flow. A couple of examples stand out here right away in terms of their level of accessibility and robustness of their materials: Index Coop, both in terms of its [new member onboarding](https://onboarding.catapultlabs.xyz/indexcoop) and [handbook](https://docs.indexcoop.com/); and Juicebox for their [Notion](https://info.juicebox.money/), built with both project creators and developers in mind. An honorable mention goes to NFT project Crypto Coven for their [community-generated public Library](https://cryptocoven.notion.site/cryptocoven/98e0b55d3c2c415bb0bdbb78f68be4a0?v=8f8de19db6484e4b85727c4ef1a5c925), which aggregates both stories of the “lore” surrounding their network and also the basics of DAOs and web3.\n\n![Index Coop’s public community handbook is among the most well-documented and transparent projects for their existing and prospective community members. (via: https://docs.indexcoop.com/) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I0XjJVI2HNx-COhFrl-rM.png?height=1224&width=2536)\n\n### Give your community a voice separate from the core build.\n\nPerhaps one of the most noteworthy trends in decentralized community management is the separation of the community’s influence from that of the core builders. Helium and Uniswap offered the strongest examples of this “church and state” effect in their decision-making frameworks. Both are equipped with a C-corp of core builders and team members and also a non-profit entity (or foundation), which is community-managed.\n\nIn Uniswap’s case, their core team Uniswap Labs owns the product (which includes the web app interface, the widget, and any other products they may roll out), but Uniswap the DAO owns the protocol. Decisions about the protocol are managed through a foundation and government through their open [governance proposal process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732). As one example of how this plays out, the recent decision to deploy v3 of Uniswap can be tracked all the way back to conversations that began in March and followed the four steps in their governance: a [Temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-uniswap-x-celo-green-pool-for-treasury-proposal/16428), a [Consensus check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-uniswap-x-celo-green-pool-for-treasury-proposal/16458), and a [Governance proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-celo/16686), ultimately leading to the [successful deployment](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-v3-deployed-on-celo/17091) on July 13.\n\nHelium is one of many projects that leverages a proposal process to manage requested changes to their protocol, called [HIPs](https://github.com/helium/HIP). (Other examples include [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://eips.ethereum.org/)” (EIPs), and similar processes at [Zcash](https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/main/zip-0000.rst) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).) Managed through Github, these changes are then routed to the core team at Helium, Inc., where most of the core devs of the Helium blockchain are employed. Both of these examples strike a mid-point balance of how to both leverage community engagement and recommendations while still allowing some degree of agility and nimble-ness from a core team.\n\n### Start with an incomplete build.\n\nOne interesting tendency among some web3 projects is to intentionally start with “incomplete builds.” A deck of Loot bags dropping as an NFT collection inspired dozens of side projects, teams, and builders to corral around the “player’s deck” and build out the world with additional elements: [Maps](https://opensea.io/collection/crypts-and-caverns), [Realms](https://scroll.bibliothecadao.xyz/docs/game/realms), [HyperLoot Characters](https://hyperlootproject.com/). A 100% creative commons collection of NFTs called Nouns beacons a new wave of [designers](https://nounstown.wtf/), [animators](https://hackmd.io/@elrgoLkbTcaX3edoqOHuQQ/nouns-the-animated-series), and [storytellers](https://nouns.wtf/vote/83) to contribute to this emergent ecosystem. Dark Forest’s decentralized world-building game was made to be exploited – actively encouraging developers to build plug-ins, integrations, and other boundary-pushing gameplay tactics – even when this sometimes meant [acknowledging when things went a little too far](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1510658041473024010). Each of these projects, and many more in the space, serve as magnets in the way they playfulness and collaboration from a community that not only decides what comes next, but also builds it themselves.\n\nIn each of these examples (arguably the most truly decentralized projects I explored), getting the starting conditions right is more important than ever. [Sina Habibian](https://twitter.com/sinahab) who advises web3 builders in the community Zeitgeist said:\n\n> *“I think being thoughtful/intentional about the initial conditions actually matters more when launching a truly decentralized project (like Loot and Nouns). That's because the core team (if a core team even exists) can't course correct as easily after the fact. There is a strong inertia to the initial choices that influences the direction the community/project evolves.”*\n\n![Loot bags, which you can buy on NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, simply contain eight lines of text with randomized items, objects, and gear. What becomes of these “trading cards” is up to the community to decide. (via: https://opensea.io/collection/lootproject)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EFSHPVSzFcIMxSjz2j3Te.png?height=880&width=1862)\n\n### Consider an intermediate layer of community leadership\n\nNearly every DAO I spoke with had some additional layer of community leadership to help manage their broader network. While the obvious thought may be to simply assign Discord permissions to server members who step up, authentic design for community ambassador programs stems much more organically. Index Coop uses something called “Owl Levels” to designate different levels of seniority in the community (Gold, Silver and Bronze, each with a vote weighting around them). Numerai elected a “Council of Elders” of senior community members who could make decisions more quickly on behalf of the broader network. Creator Cabins has a “City Council” composed of people with at least 500 $CABIN. These designations seem to serve as an extension from common web2 community-building models such as “developer evangelists,” “influencers,” or even just “brand ambassadors” in that they harbor not only titles and perks, but also some influence and authority.\n\n**BEWARE OF: The temptation to turn everything into a community vote.**\n\nProlific web3 community thought leader, [@rafathebuilder](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder), who has engaged in communities including Creator Cabins and Mirror observed:\n\n> *\"I think there’s a thing of “minimum required decentralization” — there are real trade-offs. Many organizations need to sacrifice efficiency and build decentralization through slow, organic growth. If you’re aiming for decentralization, you’re not aiming to make it cheap. You’re not optimizing on cost to production, you’re optimizing on the resiliency of the network.\"*\n\nOne of the most thoughtful essays I read on this topic came from Jon Hills at CabinDAO: *[How Decentralized Organizations Win (And Lose).](https://creators.mirror.xyz/6-iNptibzKNrQaZJR_ufiMkLQvj5mgpFYueWFKu9agU)* In this piece, Jon challenges the notion of “decentralized absolutism” and identifies principles from four (non-crypto-native) organizations that flexibly adapt around the needs of their community, without offering 100% of the power to the people. This tension is one that many crypto-native builders will need to reconcile with among their own projects and protocols – both the opportunities and challenges involved.\n\n## \\[3: converting people into participants into builders\\]\n\n![Despite the digital-first nature of web3, community is core to the ethos of builders in the space; at the Devconnect conference in Amsterdam earlier this year, a pop-up coworking space accommodated 500+ people at once. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fFvx0foJhuJDJz-uxaJ3W.png?height=3024&width=4032&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nIn an ownership economy, the active participation of members in web3 communities matters as much as users matter in web2. Many builders and founders are asking: **“What’s the web3 conversion funnel? How do I get people to go from an idle observer to a community member to an active participant in my project?”** While there’s no magic wand answer to this question (just as there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to classic marketing funnel activities in web2), here are a few observations (and one misconception) I observed from the projects in my research.\n\n### Know who your audience is (and who it isn’t).\n\nThe strongest web3 communities I encountered had absolutely no qualms about acknowledging who exactly they were targeting. Crypto Coven perhaps nails this most of all – going after “femme” culture in web3 and positioning themselves as the “anti crypto bro” culture. From the moment you [land on their website](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/), you’re transported into a different place – one of witchy language, folklore, premonitions and prophecies.\n\nWhile you might start out, as Crypto Coven’s team of “High Witches” did, intentionally targeting an audience for your project, it’s far more common for teams to discover this organically. Such was the case for Index Coop, whose audience of DeFi evangelists emerged slowly, [with each new product](https://indexcoop.com/products) that launched. With each additional product launch, a new sub-community niche emerges on Index, with each contributing in its own way to the DAO.\n\nBy contrast, Helium, a project [originally founded as an IoT company in 2013](https://blog.helium.com/welcome-to-heliums-decentralized-machine-network-2e7b0801da44), has a very high rate of brand-new-to-crypto people — for many of them, Helium is the only crypto project they’re involved in, which has influenced the flavor of community organizing in a lot of ways. These severe audience differences are also what make it impossible to define one universal approach to community.\n\n![From the second you land on Crypto Coven’s website, you know you’ve entered another world entirely. This self-selecting mechanism helps them serve as a magnet for the audience that would most align with their community. (via: https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/lore) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/On8CtKMMGb-lVAB2gk-W5.png?height=1072&width=2170)\n\n### Recognize that your most passionate community-members are willing to work for free\n\nI used to believe that most of the power in web3 existed in the inherent incentive structure for every community action taken. Whether you pick up a bounty, refer a new collaborator, or contribute in some other way, I was under the impression that all actions received some incentive or compensation as reward.\n\nBut the more I unfolded the layers of these communities that I spoke with, the more I learned that incentives are a bit of a “squishy” area – even in web3. For one, hundreds of people donated to CabinDAO’s original mission – to fund creative retreats for emerging artists – without personally benefiting from that outcome. The 17,000 people who contributed to ConstitutionDAO’s insane crowdfund campaign did so as a mere curiosity, with zero expectation of a return on that investment. But people aren’t just willing to donate money; they also donate time. Danny Aranda, now a core contributor at PartyDAO, started just as any other community participant. He said:\n\n> *\"I was a DAO member like anyone else. I started working on the project pretty organically and pretty unpaid. There was a governance proposal that we should start paying Danny, and then there was more work, and I started getting paid full time.\"*\n\nDanny’s use case is a particularly good example of how projects can assess project-market fit among their community: If people are willing to work for free (at least initially), you’ve found your hook.\n\n[In a survey of 400+ DAO members that Gitcoin conducted](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLJvPOvibcCUpJ9ES44_cdoX5Hb7LpDaloGWz5FbUEM/edit#slide=id.gea346d7c21_1_101), roughly half of respondents reported that DAOs are *not* their primary source of income. (Interestingly, this is the same percent of people who reported having at least 12 months of savings, so the relative financial security of DAO contributors may contribute toward their earnestness to take on unpaid work.) And my favorite example was learning that the [“Council of Elders”](https://twitter.com/NumeraiCoE) at Numerai also isn’t exactly paid to do that work – but the reputation of being an Elder stands on its own, and they did gift them cloaks, which the team excitedly wore in solidarity at IRL conferences together.\n\n**To be clear: I’m not suggesting that you *stop* paying your community members for their hard work and labor.** Most of these projects made it quite clear to me that there are thresholds of free work to bounty-based work and ultimately to full time, paid work. I’m simply noting that – even in the hyper-tokenized world of web3, sometimes you can get great people to do great things by just buying them some cool-looking cloaks.\n\n![Numerai consistently seeks out opportunities to reward contributors to their project in unique ways, including through this recent campaign giving away free “NFTees.” (via: https://twitter.com/NumeraiCoE/status/1547243673519214593)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6pcv3qkJ5QPFr1GZnwjrs.png?height=1202&width=1094)\n\n### Focus on a small core team of builders and a broad team of evangelists\n\nTo the outside observer, Discord server size serves as a false flag measurement of true engagement. Even for projects with Discord communities in the tens of thousands (Uniswap) or hundreds of thousands (Helium), the relative size of the contributing team is small by comparison. As a project leader, there’s a serious temptation to get sucked into the groundswell of needs, requests, ideas and suggestions from these bottomless communities. But a more disciplined, constraint-based approach to growth can help you stay focused on the North Star for your community. For most projects, the percent of community members who are also core contributors or builders is much smaller than you may think.\n\nThe best example of a strategic and intentional rollout of a product-led community strategy is through Mirror’s [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race). For more than six months, Mirror invited writers to submit content for that week’s competition, and token holders voted to admit 10 new members each week. These new members quickly became early adopters, finding kinship not only in a peer community of high-quality writers but also informing future product & protocol development for Mirror’s core team.\n\nFinally, I’ll note that some DAOs – and many NFT projects – are quick to pick out one simple, easy way for their broad base of members to serve as evangelists. This might be actively encouraging members to rock their swag ([like Bored Apes),](https://www.boredapewear.com/) funding projects that also promote brand awareness ([like Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/vote/95)) or even actively engaging on Twitter through memes and pfps. One of the main reasons that I chose Crypto Coven as an NFT project to dive into for this research was due to the intense degree of community outreach I received from the network of Witches in [my initial Twitter inquiry about community research](https://twitter.com/bethanymarz/status/1506356530614087688).\n\n![Splashy partnerships and hype installations, such as this Bored Apes inflatable as part of NFT NYC week are a popular tactic to drive brand awareness among web3 communities. (via: https://www.wsj.com/articles/marketers-at-nft-nyc-upbeat-on-brand-building-in-the-metaverse-11656324000)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PGRQr8lBFkYKgpx7r4hG0.jpeg?height=1146&width=1720)\n\n**BEWARE OF: Facilitating chatter vs. true community engagement.**\n\nIt would be a mistake to go through the motions of community, or simply follow suit to “run the playbook” of another DAO or crypto-native project. [Conway Anderson](https://twitter.com/ConwayAnderson), web3 builder and early Loot adopter has observed this in many networks he has been a part of. He said:\n\n> *“Nothing happens if you just create a Discord and put people there. Nobody really knows what they want to do. The best DAOs / products in the space have usually been a group of people who execute and through that, the broader community starts to go, “What if…?” There’s usually a certain threshold where other people start to come in.”*\n\nPart of achieving this level of engagement involves leaning into the parts of your project that are uniquely web3 – and legitimately wouldn’t be possible to build in web2 structures. Rafa noted:\n\n> *“I think that the reason why web3 feels special is because many protocols weren’t public infrastructure before web3, they were private infrastructure. It’s really hard to build a community around private infrastructure that’s more than just a “fan base” (like Apple). But it’s much harder to maintain that community when it comes to private infrastructure. Today's opportunity to unlock the power of evangelism is of a different magnitude. You have so much connectivity; you can tailor your message, do automatic translations, crowdfunds, anyone can send anyone money or pool resources together.”*\n\n## \\[4: measuring success\\]\n\n![Every community defines success differently. SharkDAO’s mission is to pool together resources to buy Nouns, and ultimately help people find their way into the Nouns NFT ecosystem. (via: https://sharks.wtf/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UXhYi3cFM5hKD7LRu116r.png?height=1064&width=1038)\n\nJust as every company carries a different definition for success, so does every community. But in this research, I encountered a few grounding principles that seemed to help some projects identify their True North, keep up the momentum, and galvanize ongoing community engagement. Here’s what that looks like in practice.\n\n### Decide whether you’re building infrastructure, or providing engagement.\n\nFirst – identify your True North Star. Some of the best advice I received during this project came from learning about [Rafa](https://twitter.com/rafathebuilder)’s distinction in building infrastructure vs. engagements. In a real-world example, he challenged me to consider the way that you might cultivate community in a neighborhood. **One option is to build infrastructure – parks, churches, community centers – and let people organically self-organize. The alternative is to design activities – block parties, game nights, town meetings – and engage people around events.**\n\nAs a web3 project leader – there’s a clear choice to make. You can build a community around your protocol (such as how Helium, Mirror, and Uniswap have done), or you can offer event-based programming designed to keep your community members coming back. (The latter is not only the case for most NFT projects but also for the myriad of DAOs, learning communities, and other decentralized, member-based networks in web3 today.) While this choice isn’t necessarily a binary one, it is something you should formulate a thesis around for your particular project.\n\n### Have a bias to action.\n\nSecond – the web3 equivalent of “move fast and break things” – Say “yes” to new partnerships and opportunities. This happens in real time, all the time: A new connection at a conference becomes an NFT artist for your next project; an errant message on Twitter or Telegram blossoms into a new Discord and a game plan to bid on the U.S. Constitution with a DAO. Due to the quick cycles of experimentation and iteration necessary for this new era, saving some space to say yes to more spontaneous opportunities (and being open-minded about what those might be) is just about one of the best decisions you can make.A few examples: CabinDAO didn’t start as a DAO. Their founder Jon hosted a group of friends for a soft launch at his initial properties once they were completed, and one of the attendees spoke about the opportunity to use crypto to scale the creator co-op that they had all been working on together. Both of the early projects that gave Juicebox their initial traction came from their core contributor Jango jumping right into two fast-moving hype projects (SharkDAO and ConstitutionDAO) – volunteering their product as the means to make it possible. It matters less if you are ready: What matters is that you are there.\n\n### Invite your community to play.\n\nThird – make it irresistible to walk away. Let’s be honest: There’s a lot of “un-fun” things about the world today. It’s easy to forget how delightful it feels to have a good laugh or take on something *totally ridiculous* with strangers on the Internet. But some of the stickiest projects I encountered – the ones you can’t help but root for no matter what – are just fun, plain and simple.\n\nI’ll bet you can’t sit through 10 minutes of [“Noun’o’clock” in the Noun Square](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock) without cracking a smile. These daily Twitter spaces commentary treats the conclusion of each live NFT auction like a sporting event, complete with wacky sound effects, and witty banter as the group follows along in real time watching potential new Noun NFTs get randomly generated.\n\n(Think a bunch of people shouting at once, things like: *“This one’s a messy design but I like it.” “I like the bonsai but not with that shirt.” “The sunglasses flamingo?! Come on!” “I’m still thinking about that pineapple.”)*\n\n![Part of “Noun’o’clock” includes a social engagement tactic called “Fomo Nouns” where randomized Nouns appear (like this flamingo-headed avatar) and participants quickly vote on which one to mint. (via: https://fomonouns.wtf/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/POMIHo6rT-HoDaa2Bz5M4.png?height=1112&width=1434)\n\nWhen I attended DevConnect earlier this year, I sat down with the core contributors behind [dfdao](http://www.dfdao.xyz/), the DAO that came together to collectively compete in the game, Dark Forest. As a non-gamer, I was stuck on one question: *“Why?”* Why did you dedicate time away from your full-time jobs to compete at a world-building game with anons all over the world? Why were you compelled to make sure you had always had someone to operate as a “pilot” to execute game play around the clock, every five minutes, for a week straight?\n\nIt didn’t click until I sat through a presentation from Ivan at 0xPARC about Dark Forest. When discussing community engagement in their game, he paused to talk about how dfdao had exposed a vulnerability that let them directly target an opponent and drain all of the resources from their planet. When he showed what this looked like in the universal map ([slide 32 in his deck here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u1nBl5Lu9q24j9pX5B9fyhwNSyZGK58nVbEoe8rNJIk/edit#slide=id.g124c1af0a63_1_103)), I watched the dfdao team proudly grin at each other ear-to-ear, audibly cackling about their cheeky path to victory. That’s when it finally hit me: To them, it’s all just play. And they are having the time of their lives.\n\nThe most fun I had on the Internet last year was watching the livestream of the Sotheby’s auction for the U.S. Constitution. The chat, Discord, and Twitter were simultaneously flooded by [memes](https://twitter.com/laurenlself/status/1459341510655180803) and [inside jokes](https://twitter.com/pseudotheos/status/1461348482401255445) and [speculation](https://twitter.com/abcoathup/status/1461495987298471942). And even when we learned we lost the bid – when the stated goal of the project failed to come to pass – the community pressed on. [This interview](https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution) with Jonah Erlich, a core ConstitutionDAO contributor, highlighted it best:\n\n> ***“Do you have a sense of why people are building a secondary market for this \\[$PEOPLE\\] token?”***\n>\n> *“People like the memes.”*\\*\n>\n> **“You think that’s it?”**\n>\n> *Yeah. People like the memes; they like to have fun. I think that one thing that I’ve learned from exploring the crypto world is that it’s very hard to rationalize a lot of the different momentums — things that happen with memes and with the memetic transfer of information. I think if people are having fun and they’re doing their thing, then I don’t try to interpret it too deeply, because I’m just going to break my brain.”*\n\nSometimes, you must throw away rationality and [“seize the memes of production.”](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1434785416536854529?lang=en)\n\n![Nicholas Cage was the star of the show for much of the meme-culture that existed around the ConstitutionDAO marketing strategy. Follow the #WAGBTC hashtag for more fun.

(Except for possibly, Uniswap, which towers above the rest as the [most beloved blockchain-enabled app](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLJvPOvibcCUpJ9ES44_cdoX5Hb7LpDaloGWz5FbUEM/edit#slide=id.gea6e71d04f_0_95). That is, at least, for now.) If web2 volatility has taught us anything, it’s that the project that can’t pivot is the project that will fail. Adaptability is key to success.\n\n## \\[wrap-up\\]\n\nSuffice it to say, a lot has happened over the past two years. The bull market run-up leading up through late 2021 crowded a lot of these spaces and communities with more energy than web3 has ever seen before – and through that saturation of energy, we witnessed an immense degree of experimentation & iteration. While temperatures have cooled somewhat in the recent macroeconomic environment and slow-down, we find ourselves at an interesting inflection point, one which allows us to take stock, dig a little deeper, and catch our bearings to direct our attention in more deliberate, intentional ways for the next phase of the crypto adoption curve.\n\nAs of yet, there is still no clear-cut winner – no single company or project who has “solved” decentralization completely (if that’s even the objective). But it is exciting to see some early patterns and behaviors emerge, ones that might guide the next generation of builders and creators (maybe including you).\n\nI invite you to continue this project with me through both exploring & contributing to the library of resources I used along the way.\n\nI’ll be releasing the rest of these individual stories on a weekly cadence [here on Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/bethanymarz.eth).

It was the top selling VHS for six years. Between 1982 and 1995, Workout sold 17M million copies and got more Americans than ever before to buy their first VCR.\n\nIn line with her feminism, Fonda's success sparked a boom of women's exercise classes, opening the formerly male-dominated fitness industry to women.\n\nToday, the millions of YouTube fitness, meditation, yoga, and other wellness teachers largely have Jane Fonda, and the inventors of the video cassette and VCR, to thank for making their careers possible.\n\n## The Intersection of Wellness and Web3\n\nGamers and musicians are paving the way for how we use NFTs and other web3 tools. But where does the $1.5T and growing wellness industry fit in?\n\nThe pandemic has made more people than ever before ask themselves: “Wait, did I move my body today?” or “I’m I depressed, or is this just life?” at least once, which has accelerated the growth.\n\nHow will today’s generation of Wellness Creators (aka: Wellness Service Providers who create free and paid content) drive mass adoption of today’s new technologies in the way Jane Fonda did in the 80s? Will they?\n\nIn this talk I gave at Collision last month, I explore how Wellness Creators might deepen the an ingredient that’s at the heart of wellbeing: connection.\n\nI also give a mini intro web3 and NFTs for anyone that wants to learn or get a refresher. And how wellness communities powered by ownership can actually build communities that are happier and more resilient.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBLxcMDP9Bg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBLxcMDP9Bg)\n\n## The wellness services industry is at the dawn of a new era.\n\n‍For over a decade, Wellness Creators (Health Coaches, Life Coaches, Fitness Trainers etc.) have brought tons of traffic to platforms with their wellness content and healthy living tips, but have received little of the upside.\n\n**There are 64 million monthly searches for wellness related content.**\n\n**Wellness content represents 20% of content across all traditional platforms.**\n\n‍And for good reason, 80% of chronic disease is caused by lifestyle choices: Diet, exercise, and managing stress.\n\nWellness Creators provide the information and accountability proven to help people live healthier lives. A 2015 study found that you , have a 10% chance of reaching a goal on your own, compared to a 95% chance of reaching it if you meet with an accountability partner or group consistently.\n\n‍Despite the value Wellness Creators provide, they lose a lot of that value to traditional social platforms. **On most traditional platforms, it takes at least 6,000 to 25,000 video views to make $100.**\n\n‍This is not sustainable. Solutions have been popping up in recent years.\n\n‍In 2021, a new possibility for Wellness Creators emerged with web3 becoming more mainstream. Web3 is a term that describes many new technologies (NFTs, Social or Community tokens, and DAOs are the most popular), that allow creators and their community members to create and share value together.\n\n‍Many are calling web3 the internet renaissance. And while web3 has grown exponentially in the gaming, visual art, and music industries, Wellness Creators, have not yet experienced the full potential of this new technology and opportunity.\n\n‍Today, there are more web3 case studies like the artist RAC, who made more money out of one NFT drop than his 15-year career as a musician.\n\n‍For Web3 to become more embraced by the mainstream, and truly disrupt the Wellness Creator industry - and positively impact public health - web3 educators need to help more Wellness Creators understand what's possible for them and their community members.\n\n‍Below I’ll explore three main ways Wellness Creators can leverage the power of web3 to better engage with and monetize their audience‍\n\n## Ready? Let's dive in🔥‍\n\n### 1. Leveraging the utility of NFTs to better engage with your existing audience ‍\n\nTL;DR: NFTs offer a way for highly engaged community members to express their loyalty to their favorite Wellness Creators, and receive the benefits of being in their closest community. ‍\n\nThe easiest way for Wellness Creators to participate in the web3 revolution is to create an NFT.\n\n‍Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) provide a way for highly-engaged community members to access premium experiences with the Wellness Creators they love. NFTS are like passes that give people access to exclusive retreats, containers, masterminds, and more. They come with scarcity, and belonging within a community.\n\n‍For Wellness Creators, NFTs represent an easy way to sell access to things like meditations, containers, and masterclasses. The value of the NFT is often the utility, and access it provides. Wellness Creators can also use NFTs to crowdfund future projects - like a course, or a book, or a training - through their community. On Blawesome, we make it easier for Wellness Creators to crowdfund, create, and sell their offerings all in one place. For ideas on how you can use NFTs in your Wellness Creator practice, read more here.\n\n‍By buying an NFT, the mostly highly-engaged community members can access an exclusive community (e.g: closed group chat, or container on Blawesome), and be part of a community of members who have shared values, and truly have skin in the game, as opposed to passive members.\n\n‍NFT holders are incentivized to share the NFT (often as their profile picture or a badge on Blawesome) and as they do, they help the Wellness Creator become more known over the long-term. The more the Wellness Creator grows in authority and respect, the more valuable the NFT becomes.\n\n‍In short, NFTs are a great tool for Wellness Creators to incentivize their communities, make their communities feel closer to them, and allow their community members to speculate on the value of the community as it grows.\n\n‍NFTs also offer a digital way for a community member to showcase their appreciation and affiliation with their favorite Wellness Creator. Often the NFT also gives the engaged community member an intimate connection with their favorite Wellness Creator.\n\n‍NFTs are a great solution for Wellness Creators with an existing community of at least 100 people, to better monetize and give more value to their most engaged members.\n\n‍In short, there are many upsides for a Wellness Creator who is willing to learn the new skillset of creating an NFT project.\n\n‍Wellness Creators don’t need a huge audience to benefit from creating an NFT community. Just 100 engaged community members is enough to start a viral community.\n\nNFTs in Wellness Communities are a great way for members to connect with the Wellness Creator, and it also acts as a motivator for community members to reach their health goals, and make friends with people who share values.\nIt's easy to retain people’s attention with NFTs when they are highly invested in their health and wellbeing\n‍\n\n### 2.Leveraging Social Tokens to develop a community ‍\n\nGreat! You’ve sold your first NFT. Your community is super engaged. What’s next?\n\n‍TL;DR; Social Tokens are an excellent tool for Wellness Creators to incentivize their community members to reach their goals, and tell their friends. ‍\n\nSocial Tokens are virtual currencies that live on a blockchain. They are usually earned by engaged community members for accomplishing goals, or achieving milestones. In the case of a wellness creator, goals and results are usually related to a community member’s wellbeing and personal development.\n\n‍Social Tokens can be redeemed in exchange for special perks within the Wellness Creator’s community, such as access to premium content, experiences, or the right to vote on future community decisions.\n\n‍NFTs are a one-off purchase that don't require additional work from community members, social tokens are earned over time by being active in personal goals, and in the community. NFTs could be compared to investing in a Wellness Creator, whereas Social Tokens are more like being paid as a freelancer and completing a project alongside the Wellness Creator.\n\n‍With a Social Token, Wellness Creators can, for example, ask their community members to make infographics of their masterclasses, take notes on group coaching sessions, make music for their meditations or podcasts, and more. Community member token holders are incentivized to make the Wellness Creator succeed as the value of their Tokens would be directly correlated to the Wellness Creator’s success.\n\n‍That's the strength of Social Tokens. As the Wellness Creator grows in authority and influence, **Social Tokens are an excellent way to include and share value with engaged community members.**\n\n‍Previously, many Wellness Creators used affiliate links to grow their community, and reward their most engaged members. Social Tokens are like affiliate links mixed with stock ownership.\n\n‍Social Tokens are a great way for Wellness Creators who are establishing their name in the community to engage their engaged community members and grow their community through well-designed incentives. Compared to NFTs, Social Tokens allow Wellness Creators to transfer value within and across the community.\n\n### ‍Things for Wellness Creators to be mindful of:\n\n* ‍Social Tokens are relatively unknown. People are more likely to buy NFTs than Social Tokens.\n* For the Tokens to have a financial value, Wellness Creators have to create a Liquidity Pool and put in money upfront.\n* Solo Wellness creators will never use the full capabilities of the social tokens technology (ERC-20) which are particularly useful to coordinate a large group of people to work together towards a common goal. ‍\n\n### 3. Building a DAO to create projects with people who share a mission\n\nTL;DR: DAOs facilitate collaboration worldwide. They are a great way for creators and their communities to build communities ;0) Think Fitness Franchise. ‍\n\nDAOs are virtual places (online communities) where people can join forces and achieve real, sustainable, cultural change. A Wellness Creator (or group of Wellness Creators) can create a DAO to leverage web3 tools, create trust with community members, and collaborate in a decentralized way, with no hierarchy.\n\n‍DAOs, which we could compare to a new form of school or training program, lets Wellness Creators and their community members work towards a joint project. DAOs make collaborations accountable and easy. DAOs are a great way for Wellness Creators to launch an entrepreneurial project with members, and leverage the power of a whole community to grow quickly.\n\n‍Wellness DAOs will be one of the most important parts of web3 and the metaverse. Learning and education is currency. Especially when it impacts your health and wellbeing.\n\n‍Blawesome is pioneering and helping pave the way for wellness creators, and especially the underserved market of female and non-binary wellness creators, to create Wellness DAOs.\n\n‍In short, DAOs are a great way for Wellness Creators to collaborate with people from around the world with shared values, to create a safe, transparent, and inclusive project.\n\n### ‍Some things to be mindful of when considering a DAO:\n\n* ‍Launching a sustainable DAO is like launching a business. It requires a lot of work, and the proper collaborators.\n* A DAO is a long-term project. Wellness Creators shouldn't expect immediate financial returns when launching a DAO. Many Wellness Creators have been creating DOAs for years without knowing it. Blawesome helps you create the structure and gives you even more tools to run your DAOs sustainably.\n\n## Conclusion: ‍\n\nThe major Wellness web3 opportunities are long term. Despite what the mainstream media says, web3 is not cash grab. Creating an NFT, Tokenized Community or DAO requires mindful daily action. But by putting in some work and learning how to use these new tools, Wellness Creators will have the power to create and sustain a long-term and healthy community.\n\nThe Wellness Creators who take the time to learn the different tools in web3 will be able to lead the way for others, and help even more people experience the benefits of health and wellness coaching.\n\n‍I dedicated my career to teaching wellness in schools, offices and hospitals, to people who were curious about learning about wellness. If you are Wellness Creator who is crypto curious, I would love to talk to you about the potential of bringing web3 to your business.\n\n### ❇️ Let’s Blawesome together!\n\nFollow Jen on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jenkruidbos)** and **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferkruidbos/)**\nSign up for Blawesome **[here](https://www.blawesome.life/contact/members-sign-up-page)**\n\n[https://www.blawesome.life/](https://www.blawesome.life/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658420003, "digest": "VdElon7QbYBCx5Kj7kb71HfJ7rOQKMciKLHApse0gdI", "contributor": "0xBA10aC8650E2c3Dd73E0c85b63042DD62f799fBe"}

Web3 allows creators and their communities to own their digital work, and benefit from the upside. In the $1.5T growing wellness market, creators are cheering on the possibilities of connecting more deeply with their communities, and creating distributed wealth.\n\n### 💪The wellness industry was already enormous and growing\n\nThe pandemic accelerated its growth by making more people than ever before ask themselves:\n\n**“Wait, did I move my body today?”**\n\n**“Am I unhappy, or is this just life?”**\n\nOr another wellness related question, at least once.\n\nMore people who didn’t prioritize their wellbeing got interested in coaching, and are still working with coaches because it works.\n\nIn fact, **people have a 95% chance of reaching their goals when meeting regularly with an accountability person or group**, compared to 10% if they go at it alone, according to a study by the American Society of Training and Development.\n\nAs a result, there are more working Wellness Creators (Wellness Service Providers like Health Coaches, Life Coaches, Fitness Trainers, Energy Healers etc. who create free and paid content) than ever before.\n\nAnd as more research reveals that income has a greater impact on mental wellbeing than therapy sessions, more health coaches are learning and teaching how to generate more income while working in humane conditions.\n\nThis combination of supportive collaborative communities, and sharing the financial upside has made Wellness Creators the next group - after musicians and visual artists - to embrace decentralized communities and other web3 protocols.\n\n## There has to be a better way\n\nToday, Wellness Creators have two choices: they can either rent their audiences on big tech platforms, where they’re at the mercy of algorithms and paid pennies on the dollar for their work.\n\nOr, they can license content or work for large wellness companies, forfeiting creative control and losing the freedom to monetize their audiences.\n\nBut what’s possible for Wellness Creators with more possibilities to deepen connection with their communities?\n\n💥**This is the question that gets us stoked at Blawesome.**\n\n## Blawesome is a community of and set of tools that make it easier for Wellness Creators and their communities to thrive together.\n\nIt’s one part social network, one part marketplace, and one part wellness creator platform.\n\nBlawesome makes it easy for vetted Wellness Creators to use social tokens and NFT gated communities — combined with courses, chat groups, live coaching and more all on the platform.\n\nThe Creators’ Token helps them better grow, manage and monetize their communities.\n\nNo?

I could have sent them to the Wellness Creators I love on traditional social media platforms, but unfortunately the teens reported those communities made things worse,” says Kruidbos.***\n\n‍The young patients often struggle with unattainable body images and anxiety as they navigate daily stresses and difficult emotions through the lens of algorithm-driven platforms that indulge comparison, highlight reels and judgment. ‍\n\nAccording to a recent study by the Royal Society for Public Health, depression, bullying, and sleep quality are some of the most common health issues exacerbated by traditional social media use at any age. Other studies have found an increased correlation between traditional social media use and feelings of isolation. Even before the pandemic, many western countries, including the U.S. and U.K., reported that more than half of their adult population suffer from loneliness.\n\n## You can sit with us\n\nBlawesome is a group of healers, teachers, coaches, fitness trainers, mixed in with some mystics and shamans, all sharing the mission to lift each other up.\n\n> ***“It’s a place where I can share my full, imperfect, human self, and everyone is cool with that,” says one of our Blawesome members.***\n\n## Right on Time\n\n**With the rise of the creator economy, and digital health, there’s a 76% increase in people seeking alternative online communities for learning and connection.**\n\nBlawesome’s flourishing community of Wellness Creators are ambitious, big hearted coaches, healers and trainers. They are ready to rock web3.\n\n**It doesn’t matter that they are non-crypto native. They are fast learners, and it doesn’t hurt that most of their work involves becoming comfortable with new, unfamiliar habits.**\n\nThe enthusiasm at our Blawesome Wellness Creator Web3 education events is palpable\n\n> ***“I love how cutting edge Blawesome is.

Very forward thinking!”***\n>\n> Michelle Maurer, Health Coach, and Blawesome Wellness Creator\n\nWe know that people thrive more in a community than alone.\n\nWhile traditional social media networks hook people through their most unevolved, primal brain urges: comparison, fear, scarcity, panic, Blawesome promotes gratitude, compassion, empathy and playfulness, emotions usually associated with increased activity in the prefrontal cortex.\n\nBlawesome is not in the business of keeping your eyeballs glued to your screen. We believe that technology is a powerful tool that can enable a meaningful connection, and add value to people’s lives. Blawesome doesn’t sell your data for profit. The algorithms are designed to match community members on similar paths who can support each other and walk each other home.\n\nMeanwhile, the technology is designed to help integrate new habits and transformations, as well as make the Creator's job easier with a one stop shop for content, booking, video or audio conference, follow up and more.\n\n**Blawesome is an unrivaled, revolutionary concept and set to finally bridge the gap between the wellness and crypto industries.

When you design systems that try to anticipate how complex organizations will act, you make a set of assumptions. Some of those assumptions will be correct, and some will be wrong.\n\nUltimately, it’s the **constant testing of those assumptions that allow systems to evolve into sophisticated, well-oiled machines.**\n\nAnd so, when you prematurely optimize DAOs, you end up with a system that’s often anticipating the wrong problems and thus creating complicated solutions to address problems the DAO does not yet have. This anticipation and problem-solving introduces new sets of assumptions into a system.\n\nWhen you introduce more assumptions, it becomes increasingly difficult to pinpoint why a system is failing – is it because of assumption A or assumption B? The more assumptions you have, the harder it is to figure out which assumptions are wrong and which are right.\n\nSo why do we prematurely optimize?\n\nFear of failure. We think if we anticipate problems now, we can design our way out of those challenges.\n\nBut often the opposite is true. In fact, it is this fear of failure that costs time and money in the long-run, as we lose the data and learnings that come from constantly testing assumptions (learning which assumptions are wrong and which are right).\n\n# The Evolutionary Organization\n\nThe key to building complex systems is not designing complexity from the start. Instead, it’s about building simple systems, allowing them to fail, and iterating on those systems based on what works and what does not work.\n\nThis is [Gall’s Law](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:gall_s_law) in action.\n\nOne important note: in these systems, failure isn’t just inevitable – it’s actually helpful. By constantly testing assumptions and maximizing learning, **these systems become evolutionary organizations.**\n\n# Flexibility\n\nBut evolutionary organizations don’t just optimize for learning – they also optimize for flexibility. Flexible systems allow organizations to leverage learnings and make incremental improvements (constantly testing assumptions!).\n\nWhen it comes to DAOs (and anything on-chain for that matter), flexibility is rarely designed into systems.\n\nBut it really should be.\n\nModularity is the name of the game in this regard. Unlike monolithic DAO implementations, modular DAO implementations allow for quick testing and iterations, which ultimately allow organizations to evolve quickly and efficiently.\n\nOften when we think about flexibility in systems design, it comes with trade-offs – typically around things like security. But flexibility doesn’t necessarily require sacrificing security. Using tools like [pods](https://www.orcaprotocol.org/), DAOs can build modular systems, which maintain security at the local pod level, while enabling flexibility at the DAO level.\n\n# Becoming Evolutionary\n\nSo you want to build an evolutionary organization, anon?\n\n**Start simple.** Stop trying to design the most sophisticated governance system. Start with something simple and evolve from there.\n\n**Fail intentionally.** Make assumptions. Test those assumptions. Repeat.\n\n**Build modular.** Think about your organization as a car. You can swap out parts and it’ll still run just fine.\n\n<br><br><br>\n\nPod-pilled? Ready to go modular? Well you’re in luck – we’ve got some big announcements coming up.

The details here are more than most users want or need, so for the big picture, see the [launch article](https://aladdindao.medium.com/concentrate-your-yields-into-the-best-defi-tokens-d08970fbe805).  Also this will not be about the IFO specifically, but rather about Concentrator in general, and how it works.  Let’s Dive In!\n\n## So How Does It Work, Exactly?\n\nBoiling it down to the elevator pitch, Concentrator helps users earn the most cvxCRV from Convex vaults.  Specifically (see diagram) this is achieved by harvesting all yields from Convex, swapping them to cvxCRV and staking them.  To use Concentrator, farmers only need to deposit their Curve LPs (or zap in) and that’s it - Concentrator handles the rest.  Behind the scenes, however, there’s more going on.\n\n![Here's the usual Concentrator flow diagram expanded and clarified a little. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5IxBfpn4HnVWdVH1cY55M.png?height=923&width=1350)\n\nWhen a new deposit comes in, Concentrator automatically stakes it in the appropriate Convex pool, then periodically harvests and swaps the Convex rewards into aCRV.  Over time depositors in these vaults will accrue aCRV.  As you can see on the diagram, aCRV is a wrapper that contains staked cvxCRV which continuously compounds behind the scenes.  Each time your LP vault is harvested (steps 2+3+4) your aCRV balance goes up, and each time the cvxCRV staking rewards are harvested (steps 5+3+4) the value of every aCRV goes up a little.  The aCRV index tracks how much cvxCRV is staked in the aCRV contract as a fraction of the total aCRV supply.  Each time cvxCRV staking rewards are harvested and compounded, the contract’s staked cvxCRV balance increases but the supply of aCRV doesn't change, so the index goes up.  The index therefore tells you how much cvxCRV each aCRV is redeemable for at any given time.  It is global, it’s the same for everyone, and only goes up over time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8mhTx2wcQOnANBPgppxWs.png?height=1122&width=900)\n\nThe Concentrator UI shows your aCRV balance, which is the sum of aCRV in your wallet (if you previously claimed/withdrew it) and claimable aCRV that has been harvested from the vaults but not yet claimed from the vault contract.  Notice that in the example image my balance is 37.7 aCRV, but because the Index is currently 1.1404 that aCRV is actually worth over 43 cvxCRV.  (37.8 \\* 1.14 =\\~ 43).\n\n## Harvesting\n\nReferring to the Concentrator Flow diagram above, harvesting is the term used to refer to either the combination of steps 2+3+4, or of steps 5+3+4. Basically harvesting means the claiming all rewards associated with a Convex pool, swapping them to cvxCRV and staking them.  These steps happen all in a single transaction per Concentrator vault. Since vaults pool all deposits together, the harvest function acts on *all* rewards for *all* depositors in the vault being harvested. No matter who runs the harvest function, everybody in the vault benefits.\n\nThere are several important details about harvesting.  First, each vault only tracks two numbers for each depositor:  Total amount deposited, and total claimable (i.e. *already harvested*) aCRV.  Since all funds are pooled together, and deposits can come and go between harvests, the vault *can not* track how much of the un-harvested rewards on the underlying Convex vault came from your deposit.  When a harvest occurs, it is divided between all depositors in the vault based on their total amount deposited *at the moment of harvest*.\n\nAs you can see, it’s impossible to predict precisely how much you will receive in the next harvest unless the next harvest is happening right now. The estimate of how much you would receive if the harvest happened right now is shown in the withdraw window for each vault, labelled “Harvest before withdraw will get:”.  **Rewards that have been harvested are all yours and will remain claimable from the contract even if you withdraw, but you only get a share of the next harvest if you’re actually in the pool when the harvest happens.**  So if you will be getting a large quantity of aCRV from the next harvest, it may be worth it for *you* to pay gas to run the Harvest function yourself.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xvow9Sh0G8eBNKsIOgj8z.png?height=1078&width=1224)\n\nYou may ask, why not harvest automatically with every withdrawal?  Harvesting is gas intensive. It involves making several Ethereum mainnet transactions.  While auto-compounders running on cheap side chains or roll-ups can get away with building an automatic harvest into every withdrawal, on Ethereum mainnet this would be horrible UX, especially for small depositors.  For smaller depositors, it is unlikely that their share of the harvest would be worth the gas cost to harvest, unless (segue!) the harvest bounty was already quite large.\n\nThe harvest bounty is the main reason that anybody ever runs the harvest.  Whoever runs and pays gas for the harvest transaction receives 1% of the harvested aCRV as a reward/bounty.  As the size of the harvest (i.e. the total value of the unharvested rewards) increases, so too does the size of the bounty.  Eventually the unharvested rewards accrue to the level where the 1% bounty is more valuable than the gas cost.  This general mechanism (often the runner is called a keeper) is the standard way that DeFi automates functions to happen without requiring central control, and typically there are bots monitoring the contracts and competing to be the first to run these functions for a profit.\n\nAs you can see, this harvest bounty dynamic makes it very difficult to predict when harvests will actually be run.  Generally harvests happen when un-harvested rewards are high enough and/or gas is low enough to make the transaction profitable.  But, they may also happen when a large depositor wishes to exit a pool, and their share of the next harvest plus the bounty is high enough to cover the gas fee.\n\n## Fees\n\n### Performance\n\nThe *only* way the platform (and the future veCTR token holders!) earns revenue is from the performance fee.  This is the fee collected by the platform each time a harvest is run.  Referring back to the Concentrator flow diagram, we recall that a “harvest” refers to steps 2+3, whether they are swapping vault rewards or the cvxCRV staking rewards which back the aCRV token.  The performance fee only applies to the harvested rewards, never to the principal deposit.\n\n### Harvest Bounty\n\nThe harvest bounty is fully described in the Harvest section, but it adds 1% to the total fees charged on each harvest.  The harvest bounty is additive with the performance fee.\n\n### Withdrawal\n\nThe withdrawal fee is different from the other two fees in two important ways 1) the fee is paid from one member of the pool to all the rest and 2) it is charged on the principal amount rather than the harvested amount.  Withdrawal fees vary from pool to pool between 0.01% and 0.5%.\n\nWithdrawal fees have a very specific purpose.  In the Harvests section, I described how harvest yields are distributed among depositors based on their deposited amount at the time of the harvest.  This dynamic can be exploited.  Imagine if a pool had some rewards that are as of yet unharvested.  If someone made a large deposit and immediately ran a harvest, they would receive a proportional share of that harvest, even though their deposit didn’t actually *earn* any of those rewards.  That person could then withdraw their principal and claim their (un-earned) share of the harvest.  This exploit could be automated by bots and run on every harvest (ever heard of MEV?) and the vaults would basically never work correctly.\n\nThe ideal withdrawal fee is set to approximately the same amount as one single harvest, and at this level the exploit I described becomes unprofitable.  If anyone were to attempt it, as soon as they withdrew their stake the withdrawal fee (remember it is distributed to the other depositors in the pool) would essentially give all their ill-gotten gains back to the pool.  \n\nOptimal withdrawal fees will vary based on TVL and APR of a given pool so for Concentrator these may be tweaked over time, but the protocol is only incentivized to set them such that they are sufficient to stop the exploit without being high enough to unduly hurt regular users.  For long-term depositors that will remain in the pool for many harvests, the withdrawal fee will be negligible.\n\n### Overall Fee Picture\n\nFor depositors, the general trade-off of using Concentrator is that they give up a small fraction of rewards (10%+1%) in exchange for boosted yields compounded without any gas costs or hassle.  Their principal is safe (withdrawal fee notwithstanding).  Non-whales simply earn more by using Concentrator, even after fees.  For really big accounts who don’t blink an eye at gas fees for multiple mainnet transactions every day or two, such as whales or DAOs managing big treasuries, the hassle saved by automating these processes is also very valuable.

{"id": "ToAIC9OVlQ4pRR7NDpmcFtW1s71F1fx4_mN2FHI-ys4", "title": "Dev Campaign #1", "body": "I don’t come from a tech background, but I do see that to have some prolonged success in this field, one needs to have some base tech knowledge. I have made it a personal goal that by the end of 2022, I will be a job-ready Blockchain dev. I honestly don’t know how realistic this is, but as Les Brown once eloquently put it, “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.“ So I will be doing this blog series as a way to track my progress and hold myself accountable through this blockchain dev journey.\n\n## Dev Campaign: a crafting questline\n\nI do have some programming experience with R and messed around with some JavaScript and Solidity, but not enough to build something from scratch. As mentioned earlier, I mean to be proficient at smart contract development. Hopefully, what I learn in the financial analysis aspect will help me develop smart contracts. To kickstart this, I will be diving deep into an awesome 32-hour course [@PatrickAlphaC](https://twitter.com/PatrickAlphaC), and [@freeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/freeCodeCamp) put out recently.\n\nThough I have some time in the blockchain/crypto industry, one can never go wrong with strengthening one’s base, so I will be taking full advantage of the course, even reviewing all basics and jotting down some key points from this week of studying.\n\nKey ideas:\n\n* Multisig: multi-signature transaction. A multisig transaction requires a defined number of people (public keys) to sign a transaction with their private keys before it’s considered valid. This increases the security of user funds by mitigating single point of failures like a stolen or lost private key.\n* Smart contracts are tamper-proof programs on blockchains with the logic: “if/when x event happens, then execute y action.” Smart contracts are Immutable, Decentralized, and Transparent.\n  * Smart contracts create trust minimized agreements; i.e., unbreakable pinky swear\n* Oracles: an oracle is anything that links off-chain data to a blockchain. Blockchains are closed systems, requiring oracles to input data from outside the system. The most used example is getting cryptocurrency's price into a contract.\n  * [@chainlink](https://twitter.com/chainlink) is a popular oracle decentralized oracle network connecting smart contracts to real-world data feeds like asset prices, price feeds, weather data, and so on.\n  * The key is that it is decentralized; having a centralized oracle feeding data to a decentralized blockchain would be counterintuitive.\n* Nonce - \"Number only used once.\" A number added to a hashed block in a blockchain that, when rehashed, meets the difficulty level restrictions. This is the number that blockchain miners are solving to receive the block reward.\n* Signing a transaction: A “one-way “ process. Someone with private key signs a transaction by their private key being hashed with their transaction data. Anyone can then verify this new transaction hash with your public key.\n* Consensus: the mechanism used to agree on the state of a blockchain\n  * Two types of consensus mechanisms:\n    * Sybil Resistance -  a way to defend against one entity by making fake nodes to gain control over the system for more rewards and makes it harder to execute something like a 51% attack\n      * Proof of Work (PoW) - a node has to go through a computationally expensive process, mining to figure out the blockchain’s nonce problem\n    * Chain Selection - Bitcoin & Ethereum use Nakamoto Consensus - a combination of PoW and longest chain rule\n    * Block time - how long it takes for blocks to be published. Proportional to how hard mining algorithms are\n    * Proof of Stake - nodes put up collateral, proving their stake in the system. In PoS, miners are called validators, nodes are chosen at random, rest of the nodes validate that the initial node is solved honestly\n  * Layer 1: Base layer blockchain implementation: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche\n  * Layer 2: Any application build on top of layer 1: Chainlink, Arbitrum, Optimism\n    * Rollups: Arbitrum Optimism -  roll-up is like a shared chain, derives security from base layer 1, and BULK sends transactions onto the layer one\n\nThe first chapter of the course is packed with TONS of useful information, and I would **HIGHLY** recommend it to people who are just starting out in blockchain for programming and nonprogramming purposes.\n\nTo those looking to understand blockchain better, I implore you to check out the first chapter of this behemoth of a course.\n\n[https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js#lesson-0-the-edge-of-the-rabbit-hole](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js#lesson-0-the-edge-of-the-rabbit-hole)\n\n## Crypto Chaos Radio 📡\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-bNl58mAY8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-bNl58mAY8)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658421781, "digest": "y2msQj1Cj-BkN6ZvfO1ajMqu_o2s6OlrhqatIZttpoo", "contributor": "0xf50301c7C9131ceDe441CDc180593d4d0EBDEF2e"}

We’ve poured our heart and soul into the art, building up our community, and preparing for launch. It’s been a fun ride and we are now ready to go. Let’s jump in.\n\n**Mint Date**\n\n1. We wanted to ensure sufficient time for perfecting and finalizing art above all else. Once Astro Babies mint, they’re forever on the blockchain. Our team of creators values quality and creativity. With our big plans moving forward into the long-term, we believe the detail and quality must be perfect from the get go.\n2. Market conditions aren’t optimal (at time of writing), but Astro Baby Club is in it for the long run and not too concerned with that factor. July 21st was a good date that we think there should be some more clarity in the market, for better or worse.\n3. July doesn’t clash with NFT.NYC (a large conference many NFT-ers will be occupied with).\n\n**Mint Price**\n\nAs mentioned above, market conditions aren’t optimal. Ethereum price is down and so are most NFTs. With the large amount of NFTs out there, it’s tough to justify such a high price as many NFTs are charging for mint.\n\nThere are many free mints in the market right now. But, Astro Baby Club, at the end of the day, is a business. And for a healthy business to grow and last in perpetuity, funds are required. 50% of the mint funds and secondary sales will go directly into the ABC Treasury for operations and growth in the future.\n\nWe wanted to keep the Mint Price affordable for all and welcome our community with open arms. Hopping onboard a fun project shouldn’t put a dent in your wallet. The Mint Price of **0.025 ETH** for Whitelist Spots gives a discounted price for early supporters of Astro Baby Club (and we thank you for it!). The Public Sale will mint at **0.035 ETH**.\n\n**Supply**\n\nThe Supply of **8,888 Astro Babies** was chosen as we felt 10,000 was just a little too many. And yet we didn’t want to go as low towards the 5,000 range as that may limit the community growth in the present and future. (8,888 is also just a nice fortuitous number!)\n\n**Team & Partner NFT Allocation**\n\nThe team loves the art just as much as you do, and we’d like to keep some Astro Babies too (we hope you don’t mind!).\n\nSome NFTs will be allocated for the ABC Treasury vault to store - owned by the entire community and used as the ABC community sees fit. A portion will be allocated to our team members and artists who have made all this happen.\n\nAnother group of NFTs are allocated to partners which have helped immensely in getting Astro Baby Club to this point.\n\nBelow is how ABC will be allocating a total of 500 reserved NFTs.\n\n**Total Reserved: 500**\n*Breakdown:*\n*ABC Treasury: 250\nABC Team: 150\nPartners and Giveaways: 100*\n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nWe are so excited to be launching. We believe the NFT industry, regardless of market conditions, is only at its birth. Astro Baby Club seeks to be at the forefront of expanding the limits of creativity, technology, and community. The team may have started the Astro Baby Club, but ABC is your club.\n\nAnd we hope to do some amazing things in the near future.\n\nLet’s go! 🚀", "timestamp": 1658421508, "digest": "LyHi1YHmakQrmtw2ydiGbweoMANm75fnRyqROKGM5rU", "contributor": "0x9f4f07b1d8a62dC44b60D67c1D75F9162fb931E7"}

Crypto companies with weak - even non-existent - business models were getting funded by cash-rich VCs and launching tokens indiscriminately (10,000+ crypto tokens were launched between 2019–2021). Meanwhile, hedge funds and crypto lenders were getting deeply overleveraged in chasing unrealistic growth targets and yields.\n\nA big part of this maverick growth was fuelled by cheap capital arising from massive money printing, and the misguided narrative that crypto is a ‘get rich quick’ money-making opportunity. As a result, crypto attracted all manner of market participants - good, bad, and inexperienced - in droves.\n\nThen the party stopped!\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine. Global food and fuel supply chains were disrupted. Gas prices skyrocketed and inflation hit a 30-year high. Central banks started sharply increasing interest rates. The global economy spiralled into a recession and triggered massive selloffs in both the equity and crypto markets.\n\n![Source: https://unsplash.com/photos/fiXLQXAhCfk](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*UZ5BzPvF9fyg6h4etrbxng.jpeg)\n\nIn a matter of months, we went from a frothy crypto run to suddenly being in a massive bear market with everyone preserving cash and preparing for extended crypto winter.\n\nCrypto markets are global and run 24X7 which makes them highly interconnected and volatile. Once the impact of global economic conditions hit crypto markets, within a matter of days, we saw the meltdown of overleveraged big players starting with Terraform Labs, Three Arrows Capital, and Celsius. Even now, more dominoes continue to topple from these fallouts.\n\nThe moment crypto market stopped being a ‘get rich quick’ scheme, opportunistic investors, worthless meme tokens and Ponzi schemes with unrealistic yields started vanishing as well. Only those entrepreneurs and investors who are dedicated to creating long-term value in crypto and believe in the transformative potential of blockchain technology remain standing.\n\nMarket conditions and the purging of risky businesses aside, the outlook for digital assets and blockchain has never been better. Companies and projects with strong business fundamentals are becoming even more resilient. They are using this slow period to focus and build the next generation of amazing products that will power Web3 and digital economy of the future.\n\n> **During the dot com crash in 2000, thousands of weak companies vanished without a trace, while some of the most notable digital businesses (Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.) were either conceived during this time or gained from the adversity and become stronger.**\n>\n> **The same will happen with crypto during this downturn.**\n\nTwo different types of adaptive strategies, metaphorically like the lotus and cactus plants, will emerge to ensure ‘survival of the fittest’ in these hostile market conditions.\n\nThe lotus plant takes waste of a swamp and creates a beautiful fragrant flower from it. Many enterprising entrepreneurs and builders will pick up pieces of failed crypto projects and transform them into better, and more valuable digital assets of the future.\n\nThe biggest precedent here is of Bitcoin itself, which was created in 2008 by improving upon failed digital money initiatives of the past such as B-Money, DigiCash and HashCash.\n\n![Source: https://unsplash.com/photos/bQyMxnjzBxM](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*MjYdwDcllkL2YBp5-rlntg.jpeg)\n\nThe cactus plant conserves critical resources and adapts to survive in the harshest conditions. Resilient crypto projects and companies will pivot quickly, adjust their strategies, conserve capital, manage risk and continue building value in their business and products. They will be ready for the market when it starts going up again.\n\nSome of the oldest and most valuable cryptos like Ripple, Ethereum and Aave have adapted, changed, and even grown stronger through numerous crypto market cycles in the past 10 years.\n\n![Source: https://unsplash.com/photos/jpREsLNInIQ](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*DrDoUb8izJb14eexRkMYsQ.jpeg)\n\nAnother existential sword that has been hanging over the crypto industry’s neck for the past several years is government regulation. After all, what’s the point of surviving a market downturn, if the regulators will ensure your demise in the end anyway.\n\nFortunately, there is changing sentiment about digital assets and a growing realization by government agencies around the world that crypto is here to stay. So instead of ignoring the industry, they have started to actively engage with it and are working on providing much-needed regulatory and operating frameworks that businesses and consumers are asking for.\n\nA lot of positive progress has been made in the EU (Markets in Crypto Assets — MiCA) and in the US (President’s Executive Order & the Bipartisan Responsible Financial Innovation Act), with more clarity expected through the remainder of 2022 and into 2023.\n\nOnce regulatory guidance is established, it will bring huge confidence in crypto assets for both retail and institutions.\n\n![Source: https://unsplash.com/photos/o0kbc907i20](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*vL_jKkOXP6AO8PjzmrBMLQ.jpeg)\n\nAs an eternal optimist, I believe market conditions will eventually improve, as they always do in any down cycle.

Launched in August 2021, it has grown into one of the most exciting experiments in community formation and governance in DeFi today. While there are many unique aspects of the Nouns project, perhaps the most iconic is its distribution mechanism: exactly one Noun is auctioned per day in perpetuity, with the proceeds flowing directly to the community treasury to be managed by Nouns holders. This mechanism has generated significant capital inflows with remarkable durability - Nouns routinely sell for 100+ ETH, helping to bootstrap a treasury of more than 25,000 ETH by July 2022 \\[1\\].\n\nGiven the initial success of the Nouns project, it is no surprise that it has already inspired rich experimentation as other communities iterate on its essential characteristics. One such example is [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf/), a Nouns fork that reduces auction duration from 24 hours to just 15 minutes. As more projects consider a Nounish distribution mechanism, the question of optimal auction frequency is likely to become increasingly debated.\n\nIn this post, I will evaluate the impact of auction frequency on a variety of key metrics: **revenue**, **community participation** and **community growth**. Critically, this evaluation attempts to assess the impact of auction frequency on these metrics holding all else equal (e.g., art, provenance, quality of initial team).\n\nFor each key metric, I provide an analysis from first principles on the potential impact of auction frequency. To bolster my arguments (or in some cases, identify limitations), I reference data from Nouns and Lil Nouns. Ultimately, I provide a framework for how various types of DAOs and / or projects who are considering a Nounish auction structure might determine their optimal auction frequency.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue is a critical consideration for any DAO or project. In a Nounish structure, auctions are the direct source of recurring revenue. In this section, I evaluate the impact of auction frequency on treasury growth and provide a perspective on how durable that growth might be over time.\n\n### How are treasury inflows impacted by auction frequency?\n\nDaily treasury inflows can be calculated with a simple equation:\n\n`Daily treasury inflows = Average winning bid price * the number of auctions per day`\n\nAs we adjust auction frequency, we would expect these two factors to move in opposite directions: a lower-frequency mechanism seems likely to result in a higher-average bid price compared to a higher-frequency mechanism. While this may seem obvious, it leaves us with a crucial question: **what is the optimal frequency to maximize daily inflows?**\n\nThe surprising answer: Assuming rational bidders, it is not clear that auction frequency should have any impact on overall treasury growth. Assuming that bidders ascribe the same total *value* to the project (based on total treasury size, etc.), they should be willing to pay the same daily amount to purchase one day’s worth of votes regardless of auction frequency.\n\nFor a concrete example, let’s assume that the current treasury for a Nounish project is 100 ETH after 100 days of auctions. For a project with one auction per day, this implies a ‘book value’ of 1 ETH / vote. We would expect the next auction to be settled with a winning bid of 1 ETH (and therefore a total daily inflow of 1 ETH to the treasury). For a project with ten auctions per day, this implies a ‘book value’ of 0.1 ETH / vote. We would expect the next auction to be settled with a winning bid of 0.1 ETH – since this project has ten auctions per day, this results in a total daily inflow of 1 ETH to the treasury. In both cases, we have a total daily inflow of 1 ETH.\n\nHowever, there are several reasons why this may not be the case in practice:\n\n* **Rarity**: This has been a key driver of NFT interest and value – less frequent auctions may increase perceived rarity (even absent explicit rarity built into the actual tokens) and therefore increase both interest and average bid price relative to higher frequency auctions\n* **Forks**: Nouns DAO has already been forked several times (e.g., Lil Nouns). There may be some premium ascribed to Nouns over its forks, as each forked community increases the value of Nouns itself (either directly or indirectly), that would result in a higher average bid price and faster treasury growth for the original community. Though not a perfect analogy, we can see that derivative NFT collections generally command lower prices than the original collections (e.g., Mutant Ape Yacht Club has a significantly lower floor price, at \\~20 ETH, than Bored Ape Yacht Club at \\~100 ETH \\[2\\])\n* **Auction settlement mechanism**: After auctions are completed in Nounish structures, a settlement transaction is required to mint a Noun and begin a new auction. This does not happen automatically – someone must trigger the settlement to launch the next auction. Therefore, auctions do not always start immediately after a prior auction has completed. While this may not have a large impact on lower-frequency auctions, it can dramatically decrease the number of auctions compared to the theoretical daily maximum for higher-frequency auctions. Lil Nouns is a good example: it has averaged \\~41 auctions per day over its lifespan, whereas the theoretical maximum would be 96 auctions per day. This may lead to decreased inflows relative to expectations, as bidders cannot predict precise auction frequency with certainty and may therefore deviate from perfectly rational bidding behavior. If Lil Nouns bidders initially bid with the expectation of \\~100 auctions per day, this may have established an average winning bid price below where it would have been if they had expected \\~50 auctions per day. Price expectations are sticky and difficult to displace, potentially making this self-fulfilling and reducing treasury growth\n* **Extreme auction frequencies**: In practice, there is likely to be a ‘sweet spot’ of acceptable auction frequencies for this type of model. Projects that choose a frequency that is extremely high (e.g., one auction every fifteen seconds) may find that there are limits to rational price discovery – even if the average bid price should, in theory, find a level where total treasury growth finds equilibrium with lower-frequency models, it may not occur in practice due to the level of consistent attention and participation demanded by such rapid auctions. This could result in more volatile winning bids, and therefore less efficient auctions. Gas fees are also likely to become a more significant factor at higher frequencies (as they make up a higher percentage of total bids and purchases), which may depress demand\n* **Post-launch change in auction frequency**: While we might expect that the initial choice of auction frequency would not impact treasury growth, the impact of a shift after launch would likely be different. As Kiran suggests [here](https://twitter.com/neuroswish/status/1540160461064310787), if an existing DAO like Nouns were to increase its rate of emissions it would likely result in an uptick in treasury growth. This is because the expected value of an incremental holder has already been established (by the lower frequency). To make this clearer - a Nounish project might start at one auction per day and establish an average winning bid of 100 ETH. At this point, each additional Noun auctioned would have an expected value of 100 ETH (based on the number of Nouns and treasury size). If the number of auctions per day increased to four, each incremental Noun would still have an expected value of 100 ETH. As long as there were enough bidders with a reserve price above 100 ETH, we would expect the price to remain steady even with the faster emissions rate. On the other hand, there is nothing to necessarily suggest that starting the project with a faster emissions rate would lead to this outcome. In fact, we might expect the project to establish an average winning bid of 25 ETH, finding equilibrium with the initial 100 ETH / day value\n\nWe can look to early data from Nouns and Lil Nouns to begin to hypothesize about the impact of auction frequency on revenue growth. Since inception in August 2021, Nouns DAO has grown its treasury significantly at an average rate of \\~100 ETH per day. After 339 auctions (as of 7/17/22), this has resulted in the inflow of 33,917 ETH since inception.\n\n![Nouns has averaged \\~100 ETH / auction since inception](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-tjyag8yLzHA91kQMKFyB.png?height=123&width=2004)\n\nThe advent of Lil Nouns, in May 2022, provides an opportunity to compare the relative impact of more frequent auctions with the original Nouns DAO mechanism.\n\nWhile Lil Nouns has conducted 2500+ auctions, it has a more limited number of total days for treasury growth analysis. We have compared its first 68 days in operation to both the first 68 days of Nouns (to hold constant the impact of starting a community) and the same 68 days of Nouns (to hold constant the impact of market conditions).\n\n![Comparison of Nouns and Lil Nouns treasury growth over 68 day periods](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e3tFUmfylRNP6vWKU1anD.png?height=437&width=1751)\n\nWe can clearly see that Nouns has been able to generate more treasury growth historically (at \\~100+ ETH per day compared to \\~24 ETH per day for Lil Nouns). This contradicts my hypothesis, but could potentially be explained by a combination of the ‘rarity’ phenomenon and the nature of Lil Nouns as a fork (and explicit ‘lesser’ derivative) of Nouns, which may depress its overall value compared to Nouns. As both projects mature, it will be interesting to see if there is any convergence in total daily revenue.\n\n### How durable will treasury growth be over time?\n\nSustaining treasury growth over time is another key consideration for Nounish DAOs. An analysis of the number of unique bidders and winning bid variability over time can provide insight into the impact auction frequency might have on project sustainability.\n\nWhile not strictly an input for treasury growth, the number of unique bidders over time on a Nounish project can serve as a proxy for general interest in the project and provide insight into its long-term treasury outlook. We would expect, all else equal, that auctions with a higher number of unique bidders tend to result in higher average winning bids and therefore that projects with a higher number of unique bidders over time will tend to be more successful and last longer.\n\nThe topic of unique bidders can be considered over two time frames: long-term (over weeks and months) and short-term (within a single day or week):\n\n* *Over the long term*, projects that are able to sustain a high number of unique bidders are more likely to maintain their treasury growth, whereas projects with a dwindling number of unique bidders are likely in trouble\n* *In the short term*, high volatility in the number of unique bidders may indicate a suboptimal auction frequency. Auctions with relatively fewer unique bidders may be more likely to be resolved with lower winning bids, which reduces the efficiency of the mechanism and slows treasury growth (see previous section for more details on this point)\n\nWhile the impact of auction frequency on the number of unique bidders (and ultimately project longevity) is not yet entirely clear, I’ve laid out several hypotheses on the potential impact:\n\n* **Short-term**: Lower-frequency auctions are likely to have somewhat lower volatility in the number of unique bidders, as participants have more time for price discovery and can monitor the auction relatively infrequently over a longer time period. Higher winning bid prices also make the relative cost of gas for bids cheaper, encouraging more bids in each auction. Conversely, higher-frequency auctions demand a more consistent level of interest and attention throughout a given time period to sustain a consistent number of unique bidders. While there is likely minimal impact within some reasonable band of auction frequencies, extreme frequencies may result in high volatility\n* **Long-term**: The impact of auction frequency on long-term volatility of unique bidders is not entirely clear. Lower frequency auctions likely limit the universe of potential buyers given the elevated average winning bid, which may result in an earlier tapering of interest. On the other hand, higher frequency auctions require a sustained level of interest over many more auctions\n\nAs we compare Nouns and Lil Nouns, we can see that Nouns, with a longer auction duration, attracts more unique bidders per auction than Lil Nouns (\\~8 for Nouns compared to \\~4 for Lil Nouns). It seems that, despite the lower barrier of entry for Lil Nouns given the price point, the longer duration auctions for Nouns is actually a more important determinant for unique bidders (at least so far). Interestingly, Nouns has largely sustained the number of unique bidders over time at \\~6-8 per auction, suggesting no significant tapering in interest to date.\n\n![Comparison of unique bidders across Nouns and Lil Nouns](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FoBZ0gZyDOF5v0WJPjNZv.png?height=168&width=1160)\n\n![Durability of unique bidders over time (Nouns)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D64dwyyEb2vJqMz31YOGd.png?height=2094&width=1992)\n\nDespite the relative stability in the number of unique bidders, there has been relatively high variability in winning auction prices for Nouns and Lil Nouns. This brings up a natural question:\n\n> *“Why the focus on unique bidders? After all, a steady supply of unique bidders over time did little to insulate Nouns from wild price swings over time (dropping from 150+ ETH in the first several months to as low as \\~50 ETH, before converging back to the overall average winning bid price of 100 ETH). There must be more important factors at play, right?”*\n\nThis is true –  there are undoubtedly other factors influencing the average bid price for Nouns over time. However, the number of unique bidders provides a useful proxy for interest in the project over time, while allowing for the abstraction of confounding variables (e.g., broader market conditions, performance of ETH). It also seems reasonable that Nounish projects may experience more dramatic price swings early in their evolution, as the market attempts to determine a fair price. This trend is clearly demonstrated with Nouns, which has experienced far less variability in recent months as the project has matured.\n\n![Comparison of winning bid characteristics across Nouns and Lil Nouns](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/h_zeLn0x7UxGBVIMi5oKn.png?height=168&width=1160)\n\n[https://app.hex.tech/6f57775d-7717-4ae7-8924-21da06597348/app/3ac71844-beb4-4416-869c-242f761542b6/latest?embedded=true&embeddedStaticCellId=3c16853c-dafd-4b8c-8b19-6e9f42f39b85&display=iframe&height=550&width=750](https://app.hex.tech/6f57775d-7717-4ae7-8924-21da06597348/app/3ac71844-beb4-4416-869c-242f761542b6/latest?embedded=true&embeddedStaticCellId=3c16853c-dafd-4b8c-8b19-6e9f42f39b85&display=iframe&height=550&width=750)\n\n## Community participation\n\nCommunity participation is another critical consideration for new projects and DAOs. For the purposes of this analysis, we will consider the impact of auction frequency on two measures of community participation: number of proposals and voter participation.\n\n### What is the impact of auction frequency on the number and diversity of proposals generated within a community?\n\nA larger community, holding all other factors equal, will tend to generate a greater number of ideas and proposals. On an absolute basis, therefore, a higher auction frequency seems likely to result in a larger number of proposals.\n\nAdditionally, this larger community is likely to be more diverse, and therefore generate a more diverse set of proposals, due to the structural elements of a higher frequency auction. A lower bid price, and more opportunities for entry, expands the set of potential community members relative to a lower frequency auction that may select for a more homogeneous population (e.g., significant economic means, deep interest in crypto projects).\n\nWe can already start to observe this trend when comparing Nouns and Lil Nouns: Nouns has averaged one proposal every \\~3 days since inception (114 proposals over 343 days) whereas Lil Nouns has averaged one proposal every \\~2.4 days (28 proposals over 68 days) \\[3\\].\n\nThe impact on the number of proposals per holder is less clear. It may be that in a lower-frequency community the average individual holder is more engaged due to the higher entry price and greater accountability fostered by the smaller community. On the other hand, lower-frequency communities may suffer from a lack of enthusiasm or decline in interest over time that leads to a decline in proposals per holder. These communities may find themselves with a relatively disinterested legacy holder base that is minimally bolstered by a slow flow of new entrants. Higher-frequency communities, meanwhile, have a more consistent flow of new holders that may serve to inject new ideas into the community and maintain more consistent interest.\n\nSo far, Nouns is outpacing Lil Nouns on this measure. Given that there are \\~ 1,400 unique holders of Lil Nouns, compared to \\~230 for Nouns \\[4\\], we can calculate an average number of each in existence over the lifespan of the project (\\~700 and \\~115, respectively \\[5\\]). Though Lil Nouns has produced proposals at an overall faster rate (with \\~25% more proposals / day than Nouns ), the difference in proposals generated clearly falls short of the difference in unique holders.\n\n### What is the impact of auction frequency on voter participation?\n\nVoter participation rate, defined as the percentage of total possible votes that are cast for each governance proposal, can be a useful metric when evaluating the overall level of community engagement and interest in a project.\n\nA lower auction frequency, while restricting the total number of community members and ultimate votes, is likely to result in a community of more engaged voters who tend to vote more often. Since holders in these communities tend to pay more on average for each vote, and each vote has a larger impact on the ultimate result, there is a larger incentive for individual holders to cast votes for each governance proposal.\n\nOn the other hand, a higher auction frequency seems likely to result in lower voter participation. As previously noted, we’d expect the average holder in these communities to have less significant economic means. Voting occurs on-chain and requires participants to pay gas – this may make the average holder in a community with more frequent auctions less likely to vote as they face the double whammy of 1) gas fees and 2) a lower relative value of their vote compared to a holder in a lower-frequency community. Ultimately, this might result in a community where only the largest holders regularly participate in governance.\n\nThis hypothesis has been supported so far by the average voter participation rate for Nouns and Lil Nouns, with Nouns averaging a \\~30% voter participation rate (roughly double the rate for Lil Nouns). These rates have been durable to date, with voter participation rate generally fluctuating by \\~10% around these averages and no noticeable drop-off for Nouns since inception.\n\n![Voter participation rate compared across Nouns and Lil Nouns](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IxvhX9yl4O5MgJzrq8Q5m.png?height=196&width=1328)\n\n\\*Excludes ‘Canceled’, ‘Active’, ‘Passing’ and ‘'Pending’ proposals\n\n^Voter participation rate defined as number of votes divided by total eligible supply at time of each proposal\n\n## Community growth\n\nDefined simply as the total number of holders in the community, community growth is controlled directly by the auction frequency: more frequent auctions will result in a larger, more rapidly growing community.\n\nOn an absolute basis, it seems obvious that more frequent auctions will result in both 1) more total votes and 2) more unique holders. Indeed, Nouns has conducted just shy of 350 individual auctions since its formation in August 2021. Lil Nouns, since its formation in May 2022, has already conducted nearly 3000 auctions.\n\nLarger communities, all else equal, will likely make it easier to market and drive new interest to the project – a community of thousands (often) has more reach than a community of hundreds. Additionally, providing more frequent opportunities to join the project may make it easier to sustain and grow interest from the broader public.\n\nHowever, there are ways that lower-frequency projects can compensate for these potential drawbacks (and that we’ve already seen from Nouns). Fractionalization provides an opportunity for more members to join the community (and at a lower price point). In the future, we may also increasingly see entire DAOs purchase individual NFTs to join lower-frequency communities – this provides a similar benefit to fractionalization in growing the community.\n\n## Implications for auction frequency\n\nBased on this analysis, we can begin to lay out a framework for how Nounish DAOs might select an auction frequency:\n\nDAOs favoring a more active community, with a greater number of proposals and diversity of membership, should likely select a more frequent auction structure. These DAOs would prioritize overall community growth, and the network effects associated with a larger holder base, over maximizing community engagement.\n\nOn the other hand, DAOs prioritizing a more engaged community may favor a less frequent auction structure. This structure may help to foster a more tightly-knit community, but would likely result in fewer total proposals and (potentially) a less diverse holder base. The cap on absolute community growth should be considered carefully, as the DAO will have fewer holders to propagate its mission and ensure continued interest. At the same time, this slower growth can lead to increased ‘prestige’ from membership and a stronger brand. The Nouns one-auction-per-day mechanism, as an example, has proven to be an exceptionally strong meme that has driven significant interest in the project, helping to propagate the Nouns brand and mission widely.\n\nThere is not an obvious right answer today on the question of optimal auction frequency for Nounish DAOs. As more experiments are conducted, and existing projects continue to provide real-world data, we will hopefully get a clearer picture. Nouns, and subsequent similar communities, should encourage these experiments to determine the best way to build the community and grow the treasury.\n\n\n---\n\n*\\[1\\]*  *Treasury balance as of July 19, 2022 was 25,530 ETH*\n\n\\[2\\] *Mutant Ape Yacht Club is a 20,000 NFT collection, which is double Bored Ape Yacht Club.

{"id": "ZLhQ3Drq6KIg2xx4f_tt_5CIzMA9kekj8r0bZzXefrY", "title": "Hi, I'm Axe, the creator of Mintedgem", "body": "My real name is Martim Molina. I’m a 25 year old degen-trepreneur born and raised in Portugal to an American-Nicaraguan mom and a Portuguese dad. I like cheesy pizza, big roller coasters, old pokémon cards, funky hip-hop, long marvel movies, and since August 2021, NFTs.\n\n## How I got into NFTs\n\nIt all started when my cousin, who’s 5 years younger than me, and who was already really into crypto, showed me his Coinbase Wallet with his NFTs; One which was a Pudgy Penguin with a crown which he had recently bought for roughly 1 ETH which was growing in price. For some reason, looking at a wallet with digital assets made me feel like I was in the future. It just made sense.\n\nYears back when I was 18, I kept telling my parents (who’ve run a paintball field for over 20 years) that one day they would be able to give field visitors paintball goggles and outfits for their virtual avatars as a sort of collectible or something to remember the real experience by. And digital collectibles like that would be everywhere. I saw it as a worldwide GTA-Online meets Pokémon Go. The Internet Universe is what I called it.\n\n![My cousin's really cool Pudgy Penguin I was super duper jealous of](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q9IRTbonexJ2V0UooFZId.png?height=600&width=600)\n\n## Fast-Forward I bought my first NFT\n\nIt’s not really a big fast-forward. Its was like the next day after knowing about NFTs that I bought a SympathyForTheDevils NFT (which I later sold to CryptoMason lol). But probably the best experience I ever had in the space came a day later from The Mike Tyson Collection by Cory Van Lew. For those who’ve never heard of it, hopefully you’ve heard of Mike Tyson. It was his official collection in collaboration with an emerging artist called Cory Van Lew and the pieces looked sick. It had barely been advertised, and it was dropping that night, and out of \\~500 pieces (most which were editions of 50-250) 10 of them were 1 of 1s going up for auction that night.\n\nI saw it as a once in a lifetime opportunity. If I teamed up with my cousin, we maybe could mint a 1 of 1 Mike Tyson, so that’s what we tried to do. On the last seconds of the auction I prayed, and I don’t usually pray. The last seconds passed and we won.\n\n![YOUNG MIKE Edition 1/1 - Bought by two crazy fucks (one which had heard of NFTs only 2 days before)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zIS7glGbLxUWRNGB8p9CG.png?height=600&width=600)\n\n## We spent 40k on an NFT and sold it 12 days later for 300k\n\nThese things don’t happen often. In fact they don’t happen at all and will not happen ever again. I wish I knew that sooner. When we sold it, I was driving with my cousin in the car. He opens his email and just starts screaming. I had to pull over. We just started blabbering screams of happiness, dancing, rolling on the floor, to the point people came out of a grocery store next to where we were to look at us. I called my parents, I called my ex who was my gf at the time, I called my best friend. It was a nice little moment, but several rug pulls and red days on the market later, I think back how good it would have been if my involvement in crypto and NFTs had stopped there.\n\n![Me and my cousin's stupid face when we sold YOUNG MIKE. There, I'm fully doxxed. You happy now?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w-jy32GJ1uwM76canaWjp.png?height=2319&width=2319)\n\n## How does this have anything to do with Mintedgem? I have better things to do. Wrap it up.\n\nIt has everything to do. During the 12 days before selling the NFT, we had a very niche NFT in our hands. It’s not anyone who has 85 ETH on their hands, and who’s ready to spend it on a Mike Tyson NFT; Especially when very few people knew about the collection, let alone NFTs.\n\n> ### “If you don’t know a collection by name, you can’t buy from it”\n\nPeople didn’t know about this collection. But we had a feeling that if people knew about it, or if we found a way to put the NFT in people’s faces, it would help us sell.\n\n## Inspiration for 1 second. Perspiration for 10 months.\n\nIn case you haven’t heard of the story of the [Million Dollar Homepage](http://milliondollarhomepage.com/), back in 2006, a guy called Alex Tew decided he would create a page with a million pixels, and sell each pixel for a dollar giving the buyer the freedom of placing a link on that pixel. The idea quickly went viral and Alex made the million dollars.\n\nI was fascinated with the idea for a long time. Most of all, I liked that he was able to create an iconic “place” on the internet which people come back to visit. The only problem about the place he created, was that its static, the visuals don’t change, and about 99% of the links on there are not working or are irrelevant by now.\n\n![The Million Dollar Homepage © 2005 Alex Tew. Alex now is a Co-Founder of the app Calm. Nicely done Alex.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tmubasWpoptx5tpBqFOqO.JPG?height=804&width=754)\n\nBut what if I created a similar page for NFTs that was dynamic? And people who are looking to gain attention on their NFTs could use it to drive more visitors to their listing page? Well, that was the beginning of the idea. Then it was a lot of drawing, brainstorming, deciding, and finding help from the right people to get Mintedgem to where it is now. And Mintedgem today is still only at the start.\n\n![A Mintedgem sketch from September 2021. Remember when I said many drawings later I really meant it. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t93ZL_FXbDO2kq2nOyf-d.jpg?height=1468&width=1120)\n\n## How the name came about + Conclusion\n\nMonths before buying my first NFT, I had bought a domain called mintedgem.com which I was going to use to make an online store for selling PSA graded trading cards. Trading cards, when in pristine condition, are labeled Gem Mint 10. But quickly I realized the name made even more sense for NFTs.\n\n### Why do we need Mintedgem? Or any other front page of NFT.\n\nTo conclude (and I promise), I really do believe Web3 needs a front page of NFT. If you have a special punk, a special ape, or anything else that’s special that you want to sell, you deserve to have more eyes on it than just the people who visit the collection page and skim through your item. If Mintedgem can provide a service where you pay $20 or so, (better even, you decide the price) to have several thousands more people see your listing, not only will you be more likely to sell, but you will get the liquidity you need faster and are more likely to sell at a value you deserve.\n\nAdditionally, the more you’re willing to pay for more attention on your NFT, the more interesting it is for the rest of us. Why are you paying $3 a day to showcase your NFT at the top of the front page to the NFT community? Maybe because you think 100k is a fair price for it, and we want to help you connect with that buyer so that you can scream and dance and call your family the moment you sell.\n\n**To sum it all up, why I believe we need Mintedgem:**\n\n* Empower sellers to reach a wider audience for faster more profitable sales.\n* Empower buyers to find more interesting opportunities at less effort.\n* Allow collections to advertise to consumers in a fair safe place. (Plz stop DMing me on Twitter/Instagram/Discord! I will not click on your links!!)\n* Onboard new user groups and the mainstream into NFTs and Web3.\n* Establish a central trading place for the NFT community that’s marketplace and blockchain agnostic (with no fees).\n\nTo me, it goes back to the “place” Alex created with the Million Dollar Homepage. If we can create a place for NFTs, that the larger NFT community is excited to keep revisiting, we will funnel in the most interesting offers of the market for all of us to see. I believe it’ll benefit everyone from small to large Collectors, Collections, Communities, and Marketplaces, and make mainstream adoption easier and closer than ever.\n\nThanks for the read. I’ll be posting more about the ongoing story of the 1001 Squares here on mirror.xyz and in the meantime, you can catch me as Axe on the Mintedgem Discord discord.gg/mintedgem or on Twitter @AxeMintedgem.\n\nStay safe and see you around.\n\nP.S. Most of the money I made with the Mike Tyson NFT I lost on Logan Paul’s stupid Zoo Coin.\n\nSorry Mom.\n\n![Zoo Coin V2 graph](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oCvtmnC93wrK-toDQTXcm.JPG?height=728&width=1251)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658425414, "digest": "1YZJyQJCCkm4KvQnD17a-wxrLdEqo1IiMKbnkGosg9w", "contributor": "0x081a25dFafC0b88aa450042BD81e98Ee48e94D50"}

{"id": "dtVSV0Z7GUB9XZ-WEqGy5spoozwx4rNgWq1DlvPkyJU", "title": "Can We Add You to Our Email Newsletter?", "body": "For you to understand our vision of how we at [TBA DAO](https://www.tbadao.xyz) see the future of social organizations, we first have to convey to you an idea that is extremely simple but difficult to grasp only because many people are not used to it. That idea is that compassion, authenticity, and ambition will be at the core of many of the most impactful social organizations in the Web3 space. Moreover, we, as creators of this new version of the internet, need to unite to either become more compassionate, authentic, and ambitious community builders or support community builders who are building communities that are making our world a more comfortable place for everyone to live.\n\nIn this document, you will learn about the business models that will empower **TBA DAO + TBA!’** to onboard 100 million compassionate, authentic, and ambitious people to Web3. The assumption we are making is that everyone is compassionate, authentic, and ambitious at their core but we currently lack the proper systems and communities that promote these characteristics in people. \n\n**The goal of this document is to:** \n\n1. Recruit potential investors to join our email newsletter so we can send updates leading up to our fundraising event in January\n2. Inspire Web3 community builders to experiment with designing more compassionate and authentic systems to govern and incentivize their members \n3. Promote a climate of full transparency in the Web3 space\n\n## TBA DAO\n\n**What is TBA DAO?**\nFounded in 2021, TBA DAO is a social club and incubator for compassionate, authentic, and ambitious people.\n\n**What is our mission?**\nOur mission is to inspire and support aspiring Web3 community builders.\n\n**What is our tagline/slogan?**\nIf we can do it, so can you!\n\n**What is our long-term goal?**\nWe want to onboard 100+ million people to Web3.\n\n**What is the gender breakdown of our core team?**\n3 women\n2 men\n\n**What is the member breakdown of our community?**\n5 Core Members\n2 Contributors\n30 Community Members\n3 Partners (Roll, Appreator Technologies, Studio RedBank)\n\n**What is the opportunity we see in our world?** \nWith the emergence of Web3 technology, there is an opportunity to unite compassionate, authentic, and ambitious people, inspire them and provide the resources they need to build impactful communities. We will do this by creating online and offline experiences where our members can come together, share ideas, and work on projects.\n\n**What is the opportunity we see in the Web3 space?** \nMany “Web3” communities lack the correct systems to promote compassion and authenticity among their members. Our solution is to use our DAO to create new open-sourced systems that can be used to promote more compassion, authenticity, and ambition within any Web3 organization.\n\n**Business Model: $TBA**\nIn January of 2023, we plan to launch our social token $TBA. Here are possible utilities for $TBA: \n\n* ***TBA Marketplace:*** A marketplace that allows members to purchase TBA products or services like Flowers NFT and Flowers clothing (See below)\n* ***Member Marketplace:*** A Craiglist-like marketplace that allows TBA members to buy and sell things to each other using $TBA\n* ***byTBA:*** In order to invest in any byTBA projects people must hold an adequate amount of $TBA (See below)\n\n**What is “byTBA”?**\nbyTBA is a program within TBA DAO that allows our core members to create their own “microDAOs” or “microBrands”.\n\n**What we know so far:** \n\n* ***Ownership:*** 25% of ownership/token supply will be given to TBA DAO and 75% of ownership will be managed by the creators and community of each project. Example: Jhamar, FlowerDog, Lexy, and Nailah are the creators of Token Talk by TBA. 25% of the $TALK token will be sent to the TBA DAO treasury and 75% will be owned and managed by the creators and community. \n* ***Creators:*** Creators can pass their position/ownership to another TBA member if they no longer want to participate in a project. In that case, their remaining allocation of tokens will transfer to the new member/s. \n* ***Mission:*** The mission is to create one-size-fits-all ownership, governance, and incentive structures that allow core TBA members to create other microDAOs or microBrands using our TBA brand and community as a launchpad. \n* ***Requirements:*** (After January 2023) Anyone that invests in any byTBA projects must hold the adequate amount of $TBA \n\n**Proof of Concept Projects:**\n\n* **Flowers byTBA** is a limited NFT collection with a mission to create online and offline experiences where collectors can come together, share ideas, and exist as their true selves. \n* **Talk byTBA** is a media platform founded by four TBA DAO members. Given the transparency of DAOs, we believe internal and external communications should be the same. Our mission is to use this media platform to learn in public and share our learnings with both our internal community and the larger Web3 community. $TALK is the token for the Token Talk community. It will be used to reward community members for helping us create media, host events, and scale our message. Our goal is to use our learnings to quantify and reward compassionate, authentic, and ambitious members within the Talk byTBA community. \n \n\n**How much are we raising?**\nIn January of 2023 our goal is to sell $2.2M worth of $TBA to anyone interested in helping us accomplish our mission of onboarding 100 million people to Web3.\n\n**How will the funds be used?** \n\n* ***Core Members:*** We will use these funds to incentivize our core members to spend more intentional time managing and operating our DAO\n* ***Partners:*** We will find partners to help us improve our branding, recruitment, and technology \n* ***byTBA:*** We will use funds to help us bring liquidity to byTBA projects \n* ***Community: ***We will use funds to incentivize community engagement and improvement\n\n## TBA!®\n\n**What is TBA!?**\nFounded in 2014, TBA!’ is an invite-only social messaging app and hub for members of TBA DAO. In 2018, our app became the first app in Apple’s App Store to allow people to earn and spend cryptocurrency.\n\n**Learn more: <https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/02/apps-for-kiks-crypto-are-beginning-to-appear-on-apple-and-google-stores/>**\n\n**What is the goal of TBA!?**\nThe goal of TBA!’ is to help TBA DAO onboard 100 million people to Web3.\n\n**How is $TBA used in our social messaging app?**\nIn our app, we currently have a loyalty program called TBA-LP/TBA Loyalty Points that allows our members to earn points for simply using our app. Members earn points for sending messages, reacting to messages, “liked” messages, “liked” reactions, and more. As we scale we will offer new ways for our members to earn points. Our goal is to replace the current loyalty points system with our own social token $TBA.\n\n**What are the features of our social messaging app?**\n\n* ***Invite-Only:*** You can only join by using a referral code given to you by current members\n* ***Connections:*** Members can add other members to their list of connections \n* ***Squad:*** Members can add members to their small group of friends we call “Squad”\n* ***Followers:*** Members can follow anonymously other members \n* ***Blasts:*** Members can send blasts to either their Connections, Squad, or Followers via silent notifications. When replying to blasts, you can react publicly in comments or privately via chat for 24 hours. All blasts, comments, and chats are deleted after 24 hours with the option to save blasts on your profile.\n* ***Education:*** We have a section in our app where we provide Web3 education via educational videos explaining basic Web3 concepts \n* ***DAO:*** We have a section of our app where core members can communicate with each other \n* ***Forum: ***We have a section in our app where members can start discussions and learn from each other\n\n**Business Model:**\n\n***Marketplace Fees:*** We will charge small fees when using our community or TBA marketplace \n\n***Strategic Partnerships/Ads:*** We will work with qualified businesses to share their products or services with our community \n\n***Upgraded Experiences: ***We will offer premium experiences and services for members\n\n**TBA!’ Ownership:**\n10% of TBA!’ is owned by TBA DAO and 90% is owned by Jhamar Youngblood, the founder. In 2021 after suffering a dramatic learning experience with the social token $KIN, I decided my messaging app will be of best use to a likeminded community of specific individuals. I got together with four women and founded TBA DAO withe the agreement that TBA!’ will be where members of TBA DAO communicate.\n\n**How much are we raising?**\nIn January of 2023, our goal is to raise $2.2M worth of equity to a person/company/or group of investors interested in helping us accomplish our mission of onboarding 100 million people to Web3.\n\n**How will the funds be used?** \n\n* ***Staff:*** We will use these funds to hire full-time operators and technicians to help us manage and scale our technology \n* ***Legal:*** We will use these funds on legal services that can protect us from any liability \n* ***Android:*** We will use funds to build our android app\n* ***Desktop:*** We will use funds to build our desktop experiences\n* ***R&D: ***We will use funds to spend time researching and experiencing new ways to improve and scale our technology\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen presented with new information during these next few months, many of the ideas and strategies above may change.

They are brightly coloured negatives burned into the retina after glimpsing something surreal but flash-intensive. They are crafted for display in a social media space that is designed by a need for attention and a constantly shifting barometer by which that attention is doled out. \n\nThese are the Freudian Id creatures that enable the deepest parts of a person to be reflected in a hyperreal but abstract metaverse of shifting, colliding, melding identities. \n\nThe monsters are friendly because the identities that want to purchase them also want to be approachable. While they may stalk you, and hover about in some kind of mania-inducing gloom, they seem to rest there, a perpetual indicator of one’s unsettledness.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a09f872-fd74-4750-8bda-08adaa142e88\\_2000x2000.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a09f872-fd74-4750-8bda-08adaa142e88\\_2000x2000.png)\n\nStandametti 1246\n\nThey look to be creatures that were just woken up from a reverie. They seem drawn by the pastel crayola vibrancy of Play-Doh, as if child’s clay was given a well-crafted nib and a master artisan then drew it on a digital slate of impossibly vibrant hues. \n\nThe artist inspirations are the art brut masters and contemporary genre-benders: Jean Dubuffet; Julian Schnabel; Andy Warhol; Giacometti. \n\nAnd lately, the Yuga Group, [the imprimatur of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, and the basis for a rumored substantial portion of a soon to be released series of physical In Real Life](https://www.pumpametti.com/12-metti-apes) (iRL) paintings. \n\nWhat has the artist made? Let’s look\n\n**The Pumpametti Taxonomy**\n\nPumpa, as his social fans call them, has come up with a series of digital art works that can be categorised in the following taxonomy: \n\n[Pumpemetti](https://www.pumpametti.com/pumpametti) – sprite / monster portrait profiles of seated subjects, frazzled chalkish lines and embellished character traits arrayed as “rarity” concepts that give each Metti a score or a uniqueness\n\n[Pettametti](https://www.pumpametti.com/pettametti) – these appear to be the canine friends of the Pumpamettis\n\n[Standametti](https://www.pumpametti.com/standametti) – these seem to be a fuller length-wise full body profile of something like a Pumpametti, but maybe their more junior cousins from a different part of the dream swamp\n\n[Metti Landscape](https://www.pumpametti.com/metti-landscape) – a glimpse into the world and a shout out to how each of these digital NFT pieces exists in a profile-heavy social media world that individuals adorn with cave painting abstract expressionism \n\nDuring the last few months, Pumpa has gone in a different direction. \n\n[Metti Team Six](https://www.pumpametti.com/metti-team-six) – a series of trading card style references to pop culture, movies, sports and heroes built on the Fantom network, bought with Metti Inu, a fork of the OHM currency. \n\n[Metti Ape](https://www.pumpametti.com/metti-ape) – a 5000 piece series of generative art that recognizes the Bored Ape Yacht Club ape and Yuga Labs as being a monumental change in the collective swarm of digital fan fiction.  \n\nThat is six series and distributions in less than 18 months. There are also more unique works, and lately some physical 24” x 24” canvases have have gone out to a few bidders and raffle winners. \n\nThe work ethic is astounding. \n\nThe criticism is equally so. \n\n**[Pumpametti enters the chat](http://www.pumpametti.com/)**\n\nI don’t know what gender Pumpametti is. I don't even know if he or she is one or many. I don’t know what Pumpametti is really up to these days – [whether the artist is preparing for a show at Pace or getting ready to travel to Venice ](https://www.pumpametti.com/12-metti-apes)to stage a pop-up show at Art Basel. \n\nI just don’t know. The artist seems to work in fits and starts. A gush of a collection is pushed out after long periods of silence, and each new series is as magical as the first.  \n\nDuring bouts of silence, when the artist is working on studio pieces – lately a group of physical IRL canvases of his NFT work – many discord members grouse about his / her lack of appearances. Numbers of their collectors fret and worry about the “floor price” of the digital objects that fans have bought. \n\nBut Pumpametti works at their own pace. They seem clearly disinterested in whether or not the work’s value is keeping up with the hype of other volume sellers. \n\n“I think of my art converging in a space between art brut and neo-expressionism, with a focus to document the crypto and contemporary societal state of mind, the chaos, frenzy, and euphoria”.\n\nThe latest two series — but especially the Metti Apes — have been used as justifications for some art world sniping about Pumpametti’s self-proclaimed designation as an art brut outsider artist.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc034d259-0646-48a3-89fa-e62148dec62b\\_1500x1500.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc034d259-0646-48a3-89fa-e62148dec62b\\_1500x1500.png)\n\nMetti Ape 909, you do your thing, king\n\nHe can’t be a true art brut artist, say some, because he went to art school and got an MFA. He also knows how to draw attention to himself, say others.\n\nPumpametti is not truly an outsider approaching the work with naïveté because they have a huge social media following and rely on memes as a “marketing” tool to spread interest in their art ([Pumpa has nearly 15,000 followers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pumpametti)).  \n\nAn “outsider” artist wouldn’t do this, some critics argue. An outsider is only an outsider when nobody knows about that artist, until a critic discovers them. \n\nThis, of course, reveals a glaring paradox. Isn’t the shunning of an artist and refusing to give them the status they seek at the same time proof that they are an outsider? \n\nThe art critics don’t seem to take that into consideration. They also don’t seem to recognize that their view of what art is and what it isn’t is boxed into an almost medieval classification of roles and designations. Art should only be what their exposure to art history recognizes it to be. Say this to them, though, and things get testy. \n\nThe digital “metaverse” that we are living in now, by virtue of its saturation of digital information,  means that visual and aesthetic knowledge is pervasive. So is the right to learn and the right to experiment. Art wants to be free. \n\nNFT is vanguard, in this case. \n\nIt’s the digital version of Basquiat walking around Manhattan at three am and spraying doodles on soon-to-be-plastered-over billboards in SoHo. It’s the same thing as Picasso or Debussey sketching something on a canvas that later becomes a palimpsest when the canvas has to be re-stretched and another painting added to the oeuvre. . \n\nInstead of the friction of history and time, art critics use the ease of information flow to erect barriers to aesthetic exploration and string barbed wire of refusal across the boundaries art brut artists wish to cross over into in their naivete. \n\nAgain, delicious irony. \n\nFor that’s the subject matter of Pumpametti.  The glaring and gouache avatar sensibility that puts everything on the surface but doesn’t define it perfectly. The half-truth monster. The greed troll. The apocalyptic movie star and the chimera philosopher who speaks of the underhuman rather than the overman. \n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F030a91fd-d366-4fd9-8b7d-a6081823f837\\_1238x1600.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F030a91fd-d366-4fd9-8b7d-a6081823f837\\_1238x1600.png)\n\na closeup of a recent IRL canvas work of a Fantom fork Metti Team Six NFT piece\n\n**Going Beyond Aesthetics **\n\nSeeing that digital art on the blockchain requires climbing a steep learning curve, the artist also has created their own crypto token, and then a series of training tutorials for any artists to learn how to launch their own smart contracts.\n\nLaunching one’s own smart contracts circumvents the bewildering loneliness of trying to find a show space. It puts the art right out there, and is a single click and digital signature with private keys away from a collector or curator to acquire the object. \n\nThe resulting ambitions are [Metti Friends, which is a tutorial system that enables artists to learn how to work with blockchain smart contracts](https://www.pumpametti.com/mettifrens). \n\nThen there is [Metti for Artists, which is a smart contract designed by Pumpametti for use themselves](https://www.pumpametti.com/mettiforartists). \n\n**What Is Next? **\n\nPumpametti comes in and out of the social media scene, dropping contests for fans and delineating their theories on art, and artist acceptance. The artist seems committed to creating as much IRL art as possible, and there are rumors that a possible show is coming up somewhere. \n\nThere have been Twitter postings of real art leaned up against studio walls and hints that gallery shots are being taken and that new web site designs are in the works. \n\nFor now, we will have to wait and see. \n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F704daf27-5326-4044-a8c6-afa15fc55cba\\_1200x1600.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F704daf27-5326-4044-a8c6-afa15fc55cba\\_1200x1600.jpeg)\n\nOne of the first IRL canvas art pieces of a Pumpametti raffled out and auctioned to only five owners this month.\n", "timestamp": 1658426211, "digest": "CozqRHS8zBrGHk6-7COaU7k6WNZqASzZB_qKXgA9Ujs", "contributor": "0x753e9283e7bD8Be3a74097B7186Ea9DeFFAEe071"}

What you see is a kind of presentation of their virtue.\n\nThese people are depicted as saints.\n\nIn one image, “They’re building a coffin your size,” the character behind the coffin is posing in a posture you might see in a 15th century painting of saints.\n\nThe hyper-modern presentation might fuel you to think this is pop art. But I see it more like meditative almost religious memorialisation to the strangeness of modern Brasilian life.\n\nEach NFT is an amalgamation of Macola’s feelings about her sense of place, and the types of people she loves, but also, their depictions are meant to also convey the importance of media, and how it shapes how she sees.\n\nShe says, though, she doesn’t really think about that.\n\n“I guess maybe it's something subconscious \\[from] someone who grew up on television, internet and public figures that almost lost humanity to the public,” she tells me.\n\n> As a kid, the media was my main way of interacting with the world. I saw something wonderful, chaotic and cynical in it all, even though I wasn't aware of those terms at the time. I loved these almost divine representations. a religious veneration towards these characters. I was also curious about the ability of these people (sometimes famous for a lifetime, sometimes famous for 5 minutes) to be at the center of something, to be the main character and how ordinary people gathered around them: smiling, crying, getting emotional and waiting for the their next step, who were basically gods made of flesh and bone. I always find myself, unconsciously, admiring and judging these things about our society and, consequently, about myself. I don't think I'm better than anyone. In fact, I like to be inside it all, but always trying to observe myself and others in our interaction with the media, with the parallel world that we consume every day.\n\nWith the media influences; the harshness of poverty; the general unsteadiness of life in a world wracked by coups, wars, covid and the extremes of polarised opinoins, Macola’s comic drawings should vibrate our frequencies.\n\nIt comes from a natural place.\n\n“My mother is a civil servant focused on labor rights - fighting child slave labor and also for the rights of the poorest workers,” she tells me in an email one day.\n\nMacola doesn’t illustrate figures to make them into fetish objects or carnival attractions. She uses detail and attention to celebrate a weirdness of life that is a reaction to rigidity and dogma. Her work is both plaintive and melancholy and hopeful and enunciating of small joys and the pairing of unlike things together to make new things. It seems very much of and about what makes Brasil Brasil.\n\n> I love my country. It is a special place, with a beautiful history of popular resistance. We have scientists, artists and people who deserve to be recognized, and it's tiring to see my people being reduced to ultra sexual women and similar misogynistic and racist stuff.\n>\n> For example, we have a universal healthcare system, which was an achievement made by the people, and I never see it mentioned by people who are not from here, so it's frustrating, as a brazilian, to be reduced to things as stupid as disrespectful stereotypes. In the end, I think that's what hurts me the most.\n\nDespite these claims, you can see that Macola still uses her pen to play with the tropes of those who see Brasil from the outside. But in doing so, she presents her subjects as very aware, and even adorns them in the cloak of the “West”, worn by those who might do the gazing.\n\nIn this picture, you see the female wrestler at centre ring. Adorned in costume, and highlighted both by lines that show her contours and comic deliberateness, as well as her shadow and dimensionality. She is surrounded by an audience, but not just any audience. It is an audience of the West’s most famous animation and Hollywood figurines. But they have been customised, familiarised for the circus freak atmosphere of this sudden and illuminating wrestling performance. What is the subject wrestling? It’s not another figure. It’s the gaze.\n\nShe is wrestling all that we bring to her. Yet, before the performance strikes up, she takes that time to pause, present herself, and indicate that whatever we may think of her, it is her time.\n\n“Brazil has a culture that I wouldn't trade for any other and I consider myself privileged … We are a force of nature, the result of a lot of suffering and resistance. a creative, intelligent people who have an enormous capacity to never stop fighting for our rights and creating art,” she says.\n\n[You can find Jeanine Macola’s work on Objkt](http://profile/).

Her mother was a Burner who traveled to Burning Man nearly every year. Hollowell tagged along, and in doing so, grew up witnessing parades of colour and light in barren spaces throbbing with electric and sensual vibrations.\n\nBy focusing on a formal abstraction of elemental functions of human experience, Hollowell achieves a visual interpretation of life that transcends the physically specific and reaches for something meditative and spiritual.\n\nHollowell’s trademark biomorphic paintings about her relationship to her body, sex, and orgasm borrow a useful metaphor from architecture and from these Burning Man experiences.\n\nWhile a person might at first see a building, an architect designs for the experience in the building: one’s life; grabbing a cup of coffee; shopping; mating.  A tribe of burners build their parade floats in a similar way. On the surface it titillates or amazes, but there is always a deeper functional purpose: to be a sauna of cosmic energy; to be a private meditative space for finding new identity; to be a sensual soak of people, spirit and purpose.\n\nHollowell does a similar thing with the subjects of her paintings. The paintings end up being not only an ornament displaying the sexual body electric, but also a meditation on the pleasure of sensual and erotic wisdom. They invite in as much as they swaddle the viewer in an undulating and coaxing interplay of light and colour.\n\n[![View full screen - View 1 of Lot 3.

But they also invite you in and take you through a Rorschach experience of orgasmic swirls, curls, waves and permutations that deliver the viewer into a meditation on the holy, or the spiritual light within orgasm, among other things.\n\n*[Lick Lick in Orange and Blue (2015)](https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6226324) *is one such painting.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3cf99fe9-8b24-4a40-92ad-6eed05d1b70c\\_1246x1666.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3cf99fe9-8b24-4a40-92ad-6eed05d1b70c\\_1246x1666.png)\n\n*Lick Lick in Orange and Blue (2015)*\n\nThis painting creates a* tete a tete* meditation between an abstract, formal presentation of the body, which serves the purpose of delivering the viewer to the core of light at its center, something that one might interpret as the soul. The third member of this sensual and erotic experience might well be considered to be the experience of *eros* itself as the viewer encounters some kind of wisdom transmitted by the subject matter itself.  \n\nHollowell has said herself: “Often there will be a light source‚ a stream of light that penetrates the entire dimension of the canvas. The light moves through the action in the painting‚ or the action is coming out of the stream of light. Those areas of chiaroscuro and high-intensity light are places of arousal. The pulsing light is like the body's energy—the pulsing of sex or the pulsing of the heart. During climax it feels like there's a bright light pouring out of me‚ like I'm going to explode. That's the kind of light energy I want to create in my paintings.\"\n\nThis large \\[64 x 48 in. (162.6 x 121.9 cm.)] oil on linen invitation is perhaps best interpreted as a visual metaphor, a type of pleasure poem. It takes the viewer into the physical first, much like a lyrical poet might talk about the things she sees, dotting the lines of the verses with visual references and suggestive metaphors for deeper and more subconscious experiences or ideas.\n\nBy focusing on an abstract, formalised feature of her own anatomy, Hollowell suggests the frisson of sex is constantly alive in the body.* *The lines of the vulva wobble and undulate, offering mimicry of nature, but also suggesting the action of orgasm and the constant movement of interpretation.\n\nJust as language is a *menage a trois* between the desire to know, the desire to name and the objective facts of existence, the paint and light in Hollowell’s canvas create an intimate connection between matter (the body) and light (the soul), and experience (pleasure’s wisdom).\n\nHer brush, her paint, and her texture are teasing us out of the analytical shell we hide under, to enjoy and loll about in the light of the world. \n\nIn *Lick Lick*, the blue pulsing light is this light, held at the core, which in orgasmic bursts out to illuminate our selves from within, offering a clearer light with which we can see and know.\n\nHollowell’s paintings do not stop at the body erotic or this orgasm light. \n\nThere are also in her paintings references to different schools of painting from which she draws her inspiration: The Transcendentalist Painting Group; Magritte; Ashile Gorky, the Dadaists and the Man Ray Active art practitioners.\n\nAnd the subject matter goes beyond simply sex.\n\nLooking through the Hollowell oeuvre,  what started out as serial encounters with orgasm and inner light earlier in her career has journeyed into motherhood, fertility, gender, identity, and politics.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91e5d5cc-9a48-4283-a2fc-8ac73799e796\\_425x566.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91e5d5cc-9a48-4283-a2fc-8ac73799e796\\_425x566.jpeg)\n\nHung (down) by Loie Hollowell\n\nI[n Hung (down)](https://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2019/contemporary-art-day-n10150/lot.407.html), “Hollowell presents an upturned figure pressured—deformed, even—by two red-tipped phalluses.

{"id": "-8JDJ75Gg_NWuRGEu3vUV7zkV_AJc3zxMVwTFLVsxgY", "title": "Welcome to LFDA", "body": "***LFDA(Liberation Front of Digital Art ) is an organization that aims to unite artists, collectors, and curators, to help each other and popularize digital art and culture.***\n\n### What is LFDA？\n\nLFDA stands for Liberation Front of Digital Art. It is an organization that aims to unite artists, collectors, and curators, to help each other and popularize digital art and culture. LFDA is a team, a community, and an army. We aim to push digital art to a whole new dimension.\n\n### What is Digital Art？\n\nDigital art can either be understood as any artistic work or practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process, or more specifically as computational art that uses and engages with digital media. It is the outcome of computer graphics technology and has been widely used in films, animation, video games, design, and other fields. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of digital artists over the years, we have seen countless great digital artworks in movies, TV series, animations, video games, music, etc.\n\n![Movies, TV series, animations, video games](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QPgD1-9D_wvJRCpDAHHCz.png?height=3337&width=4500)\n\n### “A Caged Beast”\n\nDigital art includes but is not limited to images, videos, text, and audio. So it is very convenient for dissemination, storage, and reproduction. But this also makes it difficult to trace the source and confirm the copyright, so digital art needs to rely on other media for dissemination and commercialization in most cases. In this process, digital art and these new media complemented each other and achieved amazing progress together. The technology of digital art has also developed rapidly in this process, constantly breaking the boundaries, which makes it even more regrettable that digital art has never had the opportunity to release its full potential, like a caged beast. The wall that protects it has also become a cage that restricts it.\n\n### NFT for Digital Art: A Revolutionary Change\n\nThe world is changing and we are not going back to old paradigms. Now an ownership revolution called Web3 is going on. One of the most important weapons in this revolution, NFT, is an innovative technology that has the power to revolutionize the long-standing embarrassment of digital art.\n\nAs we mentioned before digital artworks have been lacking adequate protection since their inception, the protection provided by copyright law is very limited and expensive. But now NFT is changing that. NFT technology gives each piece of digital artwork a unique block on the blockchain. Due to the traceability and immutability of the blockchain, these digital artworks that have been minted into NFTs become truly unique, always verifiable, and always traceable.\n\nThis allows digital artists to legitimately trade their digital artworks and prevent them from being stolen. Digital artists who have previously worked in film, animation, video game, design, and other fields have the opportunity to be liberated, to fully release their talents and skills, to shift the focus of artistic creation from serving commercial projects to self-expression and exploration. This fundamental liberation of productive forces will undoubtedly unleash enormous creativity and bring a huge explosion to the art world.\n\nTechnically speaking, NFT for digital art is like paint tubes for impressionism. Easy-to-store, portable paint tubes free artists from the studio, allowing them to paint outdoors anytime, anywhere to capture the rapidly changing light and shadow. This technical advancement influenced the way artists think and create, and help them to bring an entirely new wave of art to the world.\n\n![Impressionist masterpieces](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hbTJGbZ36wdwMYQyvHwgV.png?height=3254&width=5761)\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir said, “Without colors in tubes, there would be no Cézanne, no Monet, no Pissarro, and no Impressionism.”\n\n### Our Vision: The Future of Digital Art\n\nIn brief, NFT creates personal properties in the internet world, making digital content from readable, writable, to ownable. This allows digital artworks to exist independently and trade directly, which benefits creators and collectors. It will definitely attract many pioneers to start creating their experimental NFT artworks, while collectors and auction houses are eager to seek outstanding artists and magnificent artworks. The door to a new world has been opened, what kind of new era will we create in the future?\n\n![NFT artworks](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YzaHw-qh3SsEYVCyLeZ5w.png?height=2903&width=4501)\n\nThere are already some great digital artworks that are starting to hit the stage, attracting people’s attention, and bringing nice profits for artists and collectors. It is definitely a fantastic start to this revolution. These works are imaginative, dazzling, wild, unrestrained, and remarkable. They are detached from commercial projects and corporations, directly conveying to us the thoughts and feelings of creators. This directly shows us a more detailed and comprehensive contemporary social movements and zeitgeist, as many people say, this is a Digital Art Renaissance. Just as the art of the Renaissance reflected the taste and times of the mercantile community, today’s art reflects the global value system of NFT collectors. Values that espouse decentralization, open-access, participation, and self-autonomy.\n\nTherefore, we believe that in this rapidly changing digital age, more and more excellent digital artworks will emerge, which will be spread, discussed, analyzed, studied, and remembered by society and people. And these excellent works will attract more people to be curious about the crypto world, start to discover and enter this magical world.\n\nThe decentralized blockchain technology liberated digital art, and the liberated digital art will become an important force in the decentralized revolution.\n\n### Welcome to LFDA\n\nThe purpose of LFDA is to establish an art community through a series of activities and projects, in which users can make friends, communicate and discuss, explain and understand, support and promote, make art for the culture and make culture for artists.\n\nUnder the guidance of altruism, we will do our best to spread crypto culture and digital art, connect Web2 and Web3, gather as many forces as possible, and let more people join this decentralized liberation movement. Make the digital art liberation movement an iconic, monumental movement in art history.\n\nIf you also like digital art, join us and become a member of LFDA. Let's push digital art to a new level and write our contemporary art history together.\n\n![Join us!

Developers can build their own small streets feeding off of the main one. They can build buildings, parks, signs, as well as things that do not exist in Reality, such as vast hovering overhead light shows, special neighborhoods where the rules of three-dimensional spacetime are ignored, and free-combat zones where people can go to hunt and kill each other. The only difference is that since the Street does not really exist -- it’s just a computer-graphics protocol written down on a piece of paper somewhere -- none of these things is being physically built. They are, rather, pieces of software, made available to the public over the worldwide fiber-optics network. When Hiro goes into the Metaverse and looks down the Street and sees buildings and electric signs stretching off into the darkness, disappearing over the curve of the globe, he is actually staring at the graphic representations -- the user interfaces -- of a myriad different pieces of software that have been engineered by major corporations.” \\[1\\]*\n\n![Figure 1: \"Temptation of Hong Ya Dong\" - not quite the Metaverse, but a photo of Chongqing by artist Ryosuke Kosuke. Available on OpenSea.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tEnWyFYzG1X8tr6HUq96L.jpg?height=5814&width=4651)\n\n“The “Street” was the first conceptualization of the metaverse, imagined by Neal Stephenson in his 1993 novel *Snow Crash*. It’s a vision of a metaverse that is an escape from reality, where the novel’s protagonist, Hiro, can withdraw from his day job as a pizza delivery driver for the Mafia and become whoever he wants to be.\n\nIt’s a compelling and imaginative vision, but an acutely dystopian one. Similar to the more recent depictions of hypothetical metaverses, like Ready Player One, where virtual reality supplants the typically decrepit wastelands of the “real world,” it’s a vision of the future that, frankly, *we should all strive to prevent*.\n\nAnd yet, the concept of the metaverse is fundamentally changing how we interact with our reality—not in the future, but already right now. Every major corporation today is actively investing in their metaverse strategy, from gaming studios like Ubisoft to internet behemoths like (newly christened) Meta, to global retail brands like Adidas and Gucci. In fact, *whoever you are*, you are probably underestimating the impact of Web3 and the metaverse on our world.\n\nOk, so then what the hell is the metaverse? The term has become particularly tricky and ambiguous of late, with some latching on to one or another narrow, static definition, and others so repulsed by it that the mere mention of its three syllables creates a reflexive mental fortress. It can be useful as a reference to a broad and limitless set of technologies and possibilities, but it can also be pernicious in that people assign it too much preconceived meaning.\n\nThe definition we find most useful comes from Matthew Ball:\n\n> *“The Metaverse is a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.” \\[2\\]*\n\nThis is a good definition because it reflects the iterative and multi-faceted evolution of technology that has manifested time and time again over our short history. It recognizes the magnitude of the change, but builds it upon previous technology shifts, like the internet and mobile, and also leaves room for the unknown, which is inevitable. Most importantly, rather than defining the metaverse as separate from reality, it acknowledges that it is frictionlessly connected to it. The metaverse brings about a gradual thinning, perhaps even a dissolution, of the barrier between the virtual and the physical worlds—a rapprochement of our dual realities.\n\nWhile novels like *Snow Crash* depict the metaverse as virtual reality, it would be more accurate to think of VR as just one of many ways to experience the metaverse. The metaverse places “everyone inside an ‘embodied’, or ‘virtual’ or ‘3D’ version of the internet and on a nearly unending basis. In other words, we will constantly be ‘within’ the internet, rather than have access to it.” \\[3\\] That’s a hugely useful framework for understanding this shift. The metaverse is simply a persistent, digitally immersive extension of your reality—and in some ways, it’s already here.\n\nLet’s take a look at how it’s slowly invaded our lives to date.\n\n* ***Virtual & Augmented Reality***: Meta’s Oculus sold nearly 7 million units in 2021, up 100% year over year. \\[4\\] Pokémon Go, the augmented reality game that took the world by storm in the summer of 2016, has continued to attract users (with over 160 million users in 2020) and grow its revenue, reaching $1.2B in 2020. \\[5\\]\n* ***Virtual platforms & games***: it’s not just about hardware; software plays a massive role as well, particularly in the form of gaming platforms. For example, Roblox has over 200 million active users, up over 100% year over year, while Minecraft has nearly 150 million active users. This only represents the Web2 platforms; in the blockchain space, new platforms like Decentraland, The Sandbox, Cryptovoxels, and Somnium are emerging that not only provide virtual environments, but also allow for user ownership of assets like NFTs. Even more striking than the user numbers, the market for in-game skins (ie. wearables for gaming characters) is estimated at $40B a year. \\[6\\]\n* ***Web3***: the metaverse needs currencies and assets that can persist and interoperate across different platforms. In 2021 alone, the NFT market accounted for $41B in trade volume, up from just $100M in 2020. \\[7\\] The crypto market, on the other hand, is worth over $2T.\n\n![Figure 2: MAUs across Gaming Platforms  ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rrtucUNADQfoIfmJNff-e.png?height=373&width=1000)\n\nThe writing is on the wall. Against this backdrop, it is clear to us that not only will the Metaverse be host to real economic activity, it will also produce an entirely new cultural world, one that is accessible to all and completely permissionless when it comes to innovation and creativity. New cultural assets are already being created in the form of NFTs, from generative art, to memes, to music and video.\n\nOne area that has started to follow suit more recently is fashion. Companies like RTFKT Studios, The Fabricant, DressX, and others are beginning to create entirely digitally-native fashion. And while we are inspired by these pioneers, we think these companies are only scratching the surface of a market that is gigantic, living at the intersection of fashion, gaming, collectibles, and crypto.\n\n![Figure 3: RTFKT x ATARI](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hSLFwVNpS2j40VX9_Ji4U.jpg?height=520&width=840)\n\nIt is thus our opportunity to create a fashion house of brands focused on the metaverse, but still connected to our physical world; one that targets the new wave of creative talent entering this virtual world, while embracing the qualities that have captured the fascination of fashion devotees.\n\n*We’re excited to tell you more about **[altr_](https://www.altr.space/)** in the coming posts.

{"id": "o7uE479xmFpTNM2F5CirYkFAY6lZ8gU6mbCv919hZEc", "title": "Concentrator in Too Much Detail", "body": "[Concentrator](https://concentrator.aladdin.club/#/vault) has launched its innovative [IFO](https://medium.com/@0xconcentrator_29486/find-your-future-in-a-farm-9e571934c32c) with a small bit of fanfare, and it looks like Concentrator may be one of, if not the, fastest growing DeFi protocol on Ethereum right now!  We’ve seen a surge in interest in our Discord for nitty-gritty details of how Concentrator works, so I’m going to go deep into the weeds and talk about some details here. The details here are more than most users want or need, so for the big picture, see the [launch article](https://aladdindao.medium.com/concentrate-your-yields-into-the-best-defi-tokens-d08970fbe805).  Also this will not be about the IFO specifically, but rather about Concentrator in general, and how it works.  Let’s Dive In!\n\n## So How Does It Work, Exactly?\n\nBoiling it down to the elevator pitch, Concentrator helps users earn the most cvxCRV from Convex vaults.  Specifically (see diagram) this is achieved by harvesting all yields from Convex, swapping them to cvxCRV and staking them.  To use Concentrator, farmers only need to deposit their Curve LPs (or zap in) and that’s it - Concentrator handles the rest.  Behind the scenes, however, there’s more going on.\n\n![Here's the usual Concentrator flow diagram expanded and clarified a little. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5IxBfpn4HnVWdVH1cY55M.png?height=923&width=1350)\n\nWhen a new deposit comes in, Concentrator automatically stakes it in the appropriate Convex pool, then periodically harvests and swaps the Convex rewards into aCRV.  Over time depositors in these vaults will accrue aCRV.  As you can see on the diagram, aCRV is a wrapper that contains staked cvxCRV which continuously compounds behind the scenes.  Each time your LP vault is harvested (steps 2+3+4) your aCRV balance goes up, and each time the cvxCRV staking rewards are harvested (steps 5+3+4) the value of every aCRV goes up a little.  The aCRV index tracks how much cvxCRV is staked in the aCRV contract as a fraction of the total aCRV supply.  Each time cvxCRV staking rewards are harvested and compounded, the contract’s staked cvxCRV balance increases but the supply of aCRV doesn't change, so the index goes up.  The index therefore tells you how much cvxCRV each aCRV is redeemable for at any given time.  It is global, it’s the same for everyone, and only goes up over time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8mhTx2wcQOnANBPgppxWs.png?height=1122&width=900)\n\nThe Concentrator UI shows your aCRV balance, which is the sum of aCRV in your wallet (if you previously claimed/withdrew it) and claimable aCRV that has been harvested from the vaults but not yet claimed from the vault contract.  Notice that in the example image my balance is 37.7 aCRV, but because the Index is currently 1.1404 that aCRV is actually worth over 43 cvxCRV.  (37.8 \\* 1.14 =\\~ 43).\n\n## Harvesting\n\nReferring to the Concentrator Flow diagram above, harvesting is the term used to refer to either the combination of steps 2+3+4, or of steps 5+3+4. Basically harvesting means the claiming all rewards associated with a Convex pool, swapping them to cvxCRV and staking them.  These steps happen all in a single transaction per Concentrator vault. Since vaults pool all deposits together, the harvest function acts on *all* rewards for *all* depositors in the vault being harvested. No matter who runs the harvest function, everybody in the vault benefits.\n\nThere are several important details about harvesting.  First, each vault only tracks two numbers for each depositor:  Total amount deposited, and total claimable (i.e. *already harvested*) aCRV.  Since all funds are pooled together, and deposits can come and go between harvests, the vault *can not* track how much of the un-harvested rewards on the underlying Convex vault came from your deposit.  When a harvest occurs, it is divided between all depositors in the vault based on their total amount deposited *at the moment of harvest*.\n\nAs you can see, it’s impossible to predict precisely how much you will receive in the next harvest unless the next harvest is happening right now. The estimate of how much you would receive if the harvest happened right now is shown in the withdraw window for each vault, labelled “Harvest before withdraw will get:”.  **Rewards that have been harvested are all yours and will remain claimable from the contract even if you withdraw, but you only get a share of the next harvest if you’re actually in the pool when the harvest happens.**  So if you will be getting a large quantity of aCRV from the next harvest, it may be worth it for *you* to pay gas to run the Harvest function yourself.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xvow9Sh0G8eBNKsIOgj8z.png?height=1078&width=1224)\n\nYou may ask, why not harvest automatically with every withdrawal?  Harvesting is gas intensive. It involves making several Ethereum mainnet transactions.  While auto-compounders running on cheap side chains or roll-ups can get away with building an automatic harvest into every withdrawal, on Ethereum mainnet this would be horrible UX, especially for small depositors.  For smaller depositors, it is unlikely that their share of the harvest would be worth the gas cost to harvest, unless (segue!) the harvest bounty was already quite large.\n\nThe harvest bounty is the main reason that anybody ever runs the harvest.  Whoever runs and pays gas for the harvest transaction receives 1% of the harvested aCRV as a reward/bounty.  As the size of the harvest (i.e. the total value of the unharvested rewards) increases, so too does the size of the bounty.  Eventually the unharvested rewards accrue to the level where the 1% bounty is more valuable than the gas cost.  This general mechanism (often the runner is called a keeper) is the standard way that DeFi automates functions to happen without requiring central control, and typically there are bots monitoring the contracts and competing to be the first to run these functions for a profit.\n\nAs you can see, this harvest bounty dynamic makes it very difficult to predict when harvests will actually be run.  Generally harvests happen when un-harvested rewards are high enough and/or gas is low enough to make the transaction profitable.  But, they may also happen when a large depositor wishes to exit a pool, and their share of the next harvest plus the bounty is high enough to cover the gas fee.\n\n## Fees\n\n### Performance\n\nThe *only* way the platform (and the future veCTR token holders!) earns revenue is from the performance fee.  This is the fee collected by the platform each time a harvest is run.  Referring back to the Concentrator flow diagram, we recall that a “harvest” refers to steps 2+3, whether they are swapping vault rewards or the cvxCRV staking rewards which back the aCRV token.  The performance fee only applies to the harvested rewards, never to the principal deposit.\n\n> Important Note:  **During the IFO** **only** this fee is effectively zero since the platform is giving out CTR for each aCRV harvested!\n\n### Harvest Bounty\n\nThe harvest bounty is fully described in the Harvest section, but it adds 1% to the total fees charged on each harvest.  The harvest bounty is additive with the performance fee.\n\n### Withdrawal\n\nThe withdrawal fee is different from the other two fees in two important ways 1) the fee is paid from one member of the pool to all the rest and 2) it is charged on the principal amount rather than the harvested amount.  Withdrawal fees vary from pool to pool between 0.01% and 0.5%.\n\nWithdrawal fees have a very specific purpose.  In the Harvests section, I described how harvest yields are distributed among depositors based on their deposited amount at the time of the harvest.  This dynamic can be exploited.  Imagine if a pool had some rewards that are as of yet unharvested.  If someone made a large deposit and immediately ran a harvest, they would receive a proportional share of that harvest, even though their deposit didn’t actually *earn* any of those rewards.  That person could then withdraw their principal and claim their (un-earned) share of the harvest.  This exploit could be automated by bots and run on every harvest (ever heard of MEV?) and the vaults would basically never work correctly.\n\nThe ideal withdrawal fee is set to approximately the same amount as one single harvest, and at this level the exploit I described becomes unprofitable.  If anyone were to attempt it, as soon as they withdrew their stake the withdrawal fee (remember it is distributed to the other depositors in the pool) would essentially give all their ill-gotten gains back to the pool.\n\nOptimal withdrawal fees will vary based on TVL and APR of a given pool so for Concentrator these may be tweaked over time, but the protocol is only incentivized to set them such that they are sufficient to stop the exploit without being high enough to unduly hurt regular users.  For long-term depositors that will remain in the pool for many harvests, the withdrawal fee will be negligible.\n\n### Overall Fee Picture\n\nFor depositors, the general trade-off of using Concentrator is that they give up a small fraction of rewards (10%+1%) in exchange for boosted yields compounded without any gas costs or hassle.  Their principal is safe (withdrawal fee notwithstanding).  Non-whales simply earn more by using Concentrator, even after fees.  For really big accounts who don’t blink an eye at gas fees for multiple mainnet transactions every day or two, such as whales or DAOs managing big treasuries, the hassle saved by automating these processes is also very valuable.

{"id": "Nzb-wWSQ9EVyu-Qmju99fcmPihLleYySTLVGuCOvFnQ", "title": "Why I embrace AI art", "body": "AI art is pushing us further into the future, and it is fascinating to see the evolution of technology in the arts. AI allows artists to create more creative and complex works than ever before, and it opens up new possibilities for the future of art. AI can generate completely new images and concepts and push the boundaries of what we consider to be art.\n\nFor some people, this is a source of fear and panic. For AI artists, it's inspiring. It comes down to how you view artificial intelligence - as a threat or tool? We are all capable of creating AI art, but it takes a special kind of artist to see the potential in AI and use it to make something genuinely new and innovative. It takes a deeper understanding of technology, how art can be translated into instructional language, and how AI interprets it to express an idea.\n\nI have been creating visual work since I was a kid, eventually drawing my comics and creative visual stories in my teens. It's a practice I've kept up throughout the last 20 years, and I'm passionate about my particular aesthetic to this day. As a tech fan (read: nerd), I've always been fascinated by how cutting-edge technology can empower visual artists. In the 90s, while still in primary school, I fell in love with Photoshop for the first time - a tool that many in the creative industries considered to be the coming of the apocalypse. Artificial intelligence, to me, is simply a new generation of digital tooling.\n\nSome of the earliest AI art I ever saw was in the form of Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs. These networks learn by training on a dataset and generating new data similar to the training set. The results can be eerily realistic, often used for creating fake images or \"deepfakes.\" But they can also be used to create entirely new images based on the training data but not identical to it. My earlier work, The Springfield Horror, was based on this technology.\n\nTo some extent, the creation of AI art is a process of sculpting through words, data, iterative breeding, and deep learning. The work that artificial intelligence can produce when deployed by a creator with a unique aesthetic, with a vision for how AI can help them realize their working vision, is miraculous.\n\nIn many people's hands, AI art will become homogenous; like any tool, it can produce derivative and uninspired results if used without a clear purpose or direction. But in the hands of a few, AI art will continue to evolve and surprise us with its possibilities. It is up to us to ensure that AI remains a tool for creativity and innovation rather than a replacement for human ingenuity.\n\nCreative expression is about so much more than the final product; it's about the journey, process, and passion of creating something new. AI art is one more way we can express ourselves and push boundaries. As artists, we shouldn't shy away from embracing AI as a tool to help us create even more beautiful and inspiring works of art. And as humans, we shouldn't reject emerging technological fields and abdicate our responsibility to help shape and form them.", "timestamp": 1658436372, "digest": "vvQR1thIPsYDWxiz6qZinbOchVwjUIKqcLyFQ_XZXRE", "contributor": "0xB14FE5618a5Cf6D2DF8f3F8D6e893A00FfBc48d8"}
{"id": "WMufMzwP_WI03MGxQQ5hDGIscILbjNXqfMxPkna4Wj4", "title": "The world is in the dire straits of a leadership crisis", "body": "We’re in need of leaders and when I say “we” I am referring to many different societies right around the world. One of the biggest crises that we are facing as a global society today is that of a lack of leadership. We are in serious need of leaders and a next generation of leaders in that.  I am not a political scientist, but the political stage in many countries appears to be lacking direction, diversity and intentionality.  I sense too a growing frustration in younger generations as an increasing percentage absolve themselves from the debates, it’s one of the reasons as to why younger generations are so enamoured . It offers a net new design primitive for societies to be constructed through.\n\nSo what does the future hold and how might we solve the situation in which we find ourselves?\n\nIn April of this year, 2022, while sitting in an agricultural area near a small town in the south of France drinking wine with a friend’s dad and chatting about philosophy we bridged the topic of leadership and the transfer of knowledge between generations.  James, my friend’s dad, had purchased the bottle that we were drinking ten years earlier on the advance of elderly locals when he moved into his home.  One might argue that it is common knowledge wines get better as they age, but that is not the point that I would like to emphasise. The exchange to zoom in on is how the elderly locals ensured that they passed this lesson on to James when arrived in the area so that he would one day have the knowledge to pass on to the next generation.\n\nI feel that part of the leadership crisis that we are facing in the world today is because we have forgotten the importance of passing information down through different generations. In certain societies this is far more visible that others and there are indeed variations on the extremes ever within local community groups.  Our appreciation and patience for sharing stories, which is a critical part of knowledge gathering and transfer has been deprioritised because we ‘have to focus on the space right in front of us as it requires immediate action’. \n\nIf you’ll allow me to zoom in on Africa for a moment as we are both from countries that occupy the continent. Africa has a missing managers challenge, a generational gap within the organisational chart of many organisations. The through flow and nurturing of the next generation of leader for companies is a gapping hole.

However, its primary use case as of late has been in the Ethereum platform itself. Ethereum is a public blockchain-based platform that can be used to build decentralized applications such as smart contracts. Smart contracts are computer programs that run on a virtual machine called an “Ethereum node,” where users execute them and are weighed down by various transaction costs. This means Ethereum users must have access to a computer with enough processing power to execute their smart contracts. Otherwise, they risk running into problems during the operation. This issue is particularly concerning for people who want to build decentralized applications with Ethereum because it limits the number of transactions possible each second on the system to around 25 transactions per second. This means that Ethereum cannot scale up its current use cases without an efficient technology behind it, as other blockchains have done over time, such as Bitcoin. Apparently, Ethereum is an unfinished product.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q3jQO5GbNkH1HhtftlFY6.PNG?height=501&width=640)\n\n## Ethereum Platform and Functionality\n\nThe main use case for Ethereum is as a platform for building decentralized applications. However, it can also be used for other tasks, such as payment processing or even as a currency. As one of the oldest technology families in the world, the Ethereum family of systems has seen rapid growth over the years. The current version of the protocol is called “dApps” which stands for “decentralized application,” and is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The basic idea behind a d Apps is that the users build applications that run on the blockchain. The applications are run on the blockchain through smart contracts written in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. When a user wants to execute a transaction on the blockchain, he publishes a smart contract that contains the information needed to complete the transaction. This data is verified and recorded on the blockchain. When the user wants to conduct another transaction, he also publishes a smart contract that includes the details needed for that transaction. This transaction is also verified and recorded on the blockchain. The system then sends these verified transactions to the blockchain and lets users execute them. If the user’s application detects any issues, he can contact a team in the field to resolve them and still have full access to the application.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_pXqc5r7WNN1CsTTMwz3V.jpg?height=612&width=460)\n\n## Ethereum Benefits\n\n– Decentralized apps (dApps) \n\n– User-generated content (UGC) \n\n– A new way of doing business \n\n– Financial security \n\n– Low power consumption \n\n– Easy to use \n\n– Trustworthy \n\n– Universal platform \n\ndApps can run on any device with an internet connection\n\n## Ethereum Disadvantages\n\n– Lack of infrastructure: no way to create a full-blown ecosystem with apps and dApps \n\n– Lack of tools: no way to build applications without any help from the community\n\n## How to Buy Ethereum\n\nIf you’re starting out building decentralized apps (dApps), you’ll probably want to start with buying and creating an account with an online exchange like Binance. Many different exchange platforms are available, so you can try using an exchange like Binance, which offers both fiat and digital fiat currency options. Once you’ve set up your account, you can trade your fiat money or cryptocurrency for tokens or apps like the ones we’ve covered.\n\n## Decentralized Apps for All Platforms\n\nAs mentioned above, you can start building decentralized apps for all platforms, including iOS and Android. There are many different options when it comes to building an app for the respective platforms; this is because each platform has other use cases and requirements. You should research the platforms you plan to build applications for and try out applications that are favorable to your business model.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe hype around Ethereum has been huge and shows no signs of slowing down. Cryptocurrency has seen rapid growth in the last few years and has become a household name in the digital currency realm. It can be used to create decentralized applications that run on the blockchain and are verified by the network. It can also be used as a payment network, as well as as a store of value. Given all these uses, it’s easy to see why this digital currency is a great option for building decentralized applications.\n\nPhoto by[ Shubham Dhage](https://unsplash.com/@theshubhamdhage?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on[ Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/ethereum?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)", "timestamp": 1658437406, "digest": "pNoKizoGY9uSTZcMqwdj5adQjgaeLSp3e6u_icgLdZY", "contributor": "0x87D5032831E5C092c87eb879e5108da7D58f9192"}

One of the biggest crises that we are facing as a global society today is that of a lack of leadership. We are in serious need of leaders and a next generation of leaders in that.  I am not a political scientist, but the political stage in many countries appears to be lacking direction, diversity and intentionality.  I sense too a growing frustration in younger generations as an increasing percentage absolve themselves from the debates, it’s one of the reasons as to why younger generations are so enamoured . It offers a net new design primitive for societies to be constructed through.\n\nSo what does the future hold and how might we solve the situation in which we find ourselves?\n\nIn April of this year, 2022, while sitting in an agricultural area near a small town in the south of France drinking wine with a friend’s dad and chatting about philosophy we bridged the topic of leadership and the transfer of knowledge between generations.  James, my friend’s dad, had purchased the bottle that we were drinking ten years earlier on the advance of elderly locals when he moved into his home.  One might argue that it is common knowledge wines get better as they age, but that is not the point that I would like to emphasise. The exchange to zoom in on is how the elderly locals ensured that they passed this lesson on to James when arrived in the area so that he would one day have the knowledge to pass on to the next generation.\n\nI feel that part of the leadership crisis that we are facing in the world today is because we have forgotten the importance of passing information down through different generations. In certain societies this is far more visible that others and there are indeed variations on the extremes ever within local community groups.  Our appreciation and patience for sharing stories, which is a critical part of knowledge gathering and transfer has been deprioritised because we ‘have to focus on the space right in front of us as it requires immediate action’. \n\nIf you’ll allow me to zoom in on Africa for a moment as we are both from countries that occupy the continent. Africa has a missing managers challenge, a generational gap within the organisational chart of many organisations. The through flow and nurturing of the next generation of leader for companies is a gapping hole. Recognising the need to solve this is a massive step in the right direction, but it doesn’t answer the questions of how we got to this point. Part of the reason, there are many complexities, is that knowledge was not transferred through different generations as the business grew. This created context horizon gaps which lead to ability challenges.\n\nBeing a solutions thinker and a problem solver with an analytical mind, one of my first instincts is to ask the question of ‘what can we do differently to change and improve the path that we are one?’\n\nAs a starting point I think that we need to increase the knowledge that is transferred between generations.

Neste artigo eu vou explorar o que está acontecendo com o metaverso, as dificuldades que o conceito ainda vai enfrentar e onde nós devemos mirar para não ficar de fora das mudanças que acontecerão nos anos seguintes. Ficou interessado em conhecer um pouco mais sobre o assunto? Acompanhe o artigo até o final.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2EpbG_5JBjVTn1H4HHxM0.png?height=553&width=993)\n\n**Entendendo o metaverso**\n\nAntes de qualquer coisa, nós precisamos de uma vez por todas entender o que é o tal do metaverso; basicamente o metaverso é um conceito que mistura a realidade aumentada e ambientes virtuais. Podemos dizer que é a vida em um ambiente virtual, com influência do mundo real, uma rede integrada de mundos virtuais. É possível acessar esses “mundos” utilizando os famosos VR’s ou óculos de realidade aumentada. Os usuários navegam pelo metaverso usando seus movimentos oculares, controladores de feedback ou comandos de voz. O fone de ouvido mergulha o usuário, estimulando o que é conhecido como presença, que é criado ao gerar a sensação física de estar realmente ali.\n\nPara encontrar metaversos que já funcionam, basta olhar para os jogos FreeFire, FortNite ou Horizon Worlds, todos os jogadores utilizam avatares para interagir com o jogo e com os demais participantes. Mas as aplicações vão além dos jogos, hoje nós temos movimentos interessantes para a indústria da música,  algumas gravadoras e artistas, por exemplo, já organizaram shows nesse novo conceito de realidade aumentada, nós também encontramos o metaverso sendo requisitado no meio esportivo, com times de futebol  construindo estádios virtuais, permitindo venda de conteúdo esportivo, interação com o ambiente do clube e transmissão de partidas em tempo real.  \n\n![Manchester City é o primeiro clube a construir um estádio no metaverso.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AM3JWYL4Kt_XsfHPxQvzF.png?height=1106&width=1600)\n\nAs aplicações são tão extensas que a maioria das empresas de tecnologia estão de olho na direção que este mercado está tomando. Seguindo os passos do Facebook, a Microsoft recentemente anunciou a aquisição da gigante Activision Blizzard,  por cerca de US $70 bilhões, o anúncio veio junto com a declaração de estar mirando no metaverso. Outras empresas também estão mirando nessa nova onda, é o caso da Nike, Nivida Omniverse e até mesmo o Banco do Brasil.\n\n![Microsoft mira metaverso](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VYCfYBoa5s5lP-hEBeWPP.png?height=1350&width=2400)\n\n**Desafios enfrentados pelo metaverso**\n\n Mas existem obstáculos que precisam ser vencidos antes que o metaverso alcance popularidade. E eu diria que o obstáculo central é justamente a parte “virtual” deste universo. \n\nEmbora a realidade aumentada seja considerada um aspecto fundamental para o metaverso, a entrada no metaverso não deve se limitar a ter um óculos de realidade aumentada. De alguma maneira, qualquer pessoa com um computador ou smartphone deveria poder acessar uma experiência do metaverso, assim como já funciona com os jogos Free Fire e FortNite. Oferecer acessibilidade e democratização é a chave para fazer o metaverso funcionar.\n\n O nicho de VRs apresentou mudanças razoáveis em um curto espaço de tempo. Poucos anos atrás, quem tivesse interesse em uma VR doméstica tinha que escolher entre sistemas extremamente caros ou em fones de ouvido baseados em smartphones de baixo custo, mas extremamente limitados. Hoje temos algumas opções como os VR’s desenvolvidos pela empresa META, que permitem que mais usuários conseguissem começar a experimentar deste novo universo. Apesar de ser um passo interessante, e as vendas terem crescido muito, sobretudo  em 2021, o aparelho ainda está distante de ser acessível e abraçar todas as parcelas da população. \n\n![Óculos de realidade aumentada não são acessíveis e geram desconforto aos usuários.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pyRXOGmnS1_27tbJpvKXv.png?height=532&width=936)\n\nFazer com que as pessoas usem seus dispositivos pode ser um desafio, pois estima-se que apenas 28% das pessoas que possuem óculos de realidade aumentada os usam diariamente. Como vários críticos de tecnologia apontaram, a revolução mainstream de VR que foi prometida por anos ainda não se concretizou. \n\n**Aparelhos desconfortáveis** \n\nExistem vários motivos, desde preços inacessíveis até obstáculos de fabricação, que explicam o por que a realidade aumentada não pegou de uma maneira maior. Mas é possível que o uso de um aparelho seja desagradável para a maior parte das pessoas, principalmente para uso continuo. \n\nApesar dos avanços impressionantes na tecnologia de tela, os desenvolvedores ainda estão tentando lidar com a “ ciberdoença ” – uma sensação de náusea semelhante ao enjoo – que seus dispositivos provocam em muitos usuários. Certamente são pontos relevantes que atrapalham a disseminação da utilização da realidade virtual a inserção completa do conceito de metaverso na sociedade.\n\nPortanto, podemos afirmar que o metaverso ainda é um mar a ser explorado, há muitas perguntas que precisam ser respondidas, e alguns conceitos remodelados para que seja acessível e escalável. Apesar disso, a maioria das grandes empresas estão sim com os pés fincados no metaverso, a evolução está acontecendo de forma rápida e direcionada, e é possível aproveitar este rumo que o mercado está levando e investir ou até mesmo empreender neste nicho.

{"id": "nxykavG5fAnBFRl7zRGPW32LjwaVniU6aYymta0QbEw", "title": "Pillheads // Recovery", "body": "Almost every day in the web3 space, we hear about folks being rugged, scammed, phished, hacked, and more. Even though some of us have been here for a while now, we are still surprised when things go pear-shaped for certain projects and/or individuals in the space. It’s the wild west out here on trustless networks, and we are still on web2 technology that is incredibly exploitable.\n\nOn a day where [Zeneca_33](https://twitter.com/Zeneca_33) had their twitter account phished, and multiple projects lost control of their Discord servers, we were all thinking about this tweet the day prior from Yuga Labs:\n\n[https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1549157338665336839](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1549157338665336839)\n\nAnd so this bullshit finally happened to us. And I’m going to tell you the story of how it happened, and what our takeaways are from the situation, now that we’ve dealt with it firsthand. I’ll start from the beginning.\n\nAround 3-4 months ago, we reconfigured a ton of things on the Discord server, in anticipation of the coming Pillheads Generative mint. About a month after that, we revisited the setup, and beefed up some security measures, as we noticed a sudden spike in Discords being compromised, as well as more rugged NFT projects coming out, where their dogsh\\*t looking minters would drain wallets after signed interactions.\n\n![The fake minter looked about as bad as this. Would you mint from a site like this?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ah59gdemKPrdTL6EMFw4b.jpeg?height=480&width=640)\n\nPart of our security measures were to reduce permissions for some roles, continue encouraging everybody on the team to change passwords, and also to introduce some new preventative measures in the form of bots. We were aware that the vast majority of compromised servers were the result of mods and/or other lead roles in projects having their personal accounts phished, or otherwise compromised.\n\nI’ve always been nervous about security on the web - ever since the early 90s. Not much has changed between then and now; the vast majority of attacks where somebody loses control of their accounts are a result of social engineering. I consistently yell “**PEBKAC**,” about anything that goes wrong on the web.\n\n> **How did events play out?**\n\nSo, when my phone started blowing up at roughly 6PM ET on Tuesday, July 19th, and I saw messages rolling in from close friends in the space saying “DISCORD HACKED,” “DISCORD UNDER ATTACK,” and “PH DISCORD GETTIN REKT,” my reaction was initially somewhere between pure panic and really hard facepalming. The realization that this bullshit had happened to us hit me hard.\n\nI had to be sure: was it my Discord setup that was compromised? Did I give a bad player in the space the wrong permissions recently? Did I get phished? Could it be I got SIMjacked? I went through dozens of scenarios in my head before doing anything. The message notifications on my phone started getting a little crazy.\n\nSo I took a deep breath and opened up Discord on my laptop. I immediately went to the Ph Discord, and noticed a ton of scammy links in announcements, a bunch of people calling errant behavior out, and a bunch of mismatched roles in the right sidebar for users. I checked wickbot to see why it wasn’t doing its job; after all it exists for this purpose. It should be catching mass role changes, repetitive messages and link sharing, and a slew of other things.\n\nWickbot was gone, I was locked out of web frontends for all of the bots, and there were some very not-CFW-like comments and announcements from CFW himself.\n\n“We’re minting”\n\n“We closed channels to avoid FUD”\n\n“Click this link…”\n\nIt hit me immediately that [CFW’s](https://twitter.com/iamcfw) account had been hijacked. Before I could do anything else, I got the boot, along with the rest of our dev team, and some of our core team members. [UnkFunk](https://twitter.com/unknownfunkhero) *immediately* started blowing up [Potadough](https://twitter.com/PotadoughNFT) and CFW’s DMs across multiple platforms, trying to contact them, while I began assessing the situation. We immediately began changing passwords and emails associated with our web facing accounts, including our hosting, team google account, and socials. [Whitelights](https://twitter.com/iamwhitelights) and [0xDaemon](https://twitter.com/KingCryptoad) went to town on looking into the contracts and minter the scammers dropped. Our family at Sideways DAO began alerting everybody in our circles about CFW’s account being compromised, and the PH server being unsafe. We told everybody we were hacked, and that they should not trust any links from us.\n\n![Welp, there go the devs @#$!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FtqWWUmnc9lOhtqJ_EXOL.png?height=402&width=1326)\n\nWithin 2.5 hours CFW had regained control of his account, we had verified each others’ identities (VC is great, and so is sharing IRL experiences at NFT NYC to call on to prove identities), and had managed to boot the malicious actors out of the server, as well as resetting his password from a secure device with a fresh discord install. The damage was done though. Some folks had interacted with the contract, and our server was wrecked. We were now into mitigation, assessment, and full on discovery mode.\n\nFor the record, I am blown away by our team’s (core & mods) response time, how calm everybody was, and how well we handled it with our close community of friends and family in the space. I can’t shout all of you outside of the team out, but you know who you are, and we are ever thankful for you moving rapidly, and gracefully to warn other projects about what happened. Extra special thanks to [Flashfox](https://twitter.com/flashfoxart) for moving very rapidly to keep other NFT projects informed of the situation.\n\nMost importantly, a huge and massive shoutout to CFW for immediately addressing the problem, and getting ahead of things safely and smartly. It is clear as daylight to me that he has assembled the right team for this project, especially after this debacle.\n\n![A whois query on the URL the scammers had their fake minter on](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d__HhHnivtDmM4Tl4BLAk.png?height=1114&width=1346)\n\nSo, you may ask, what the fuck *actually* happened to CFW’s account?\n\n> **Problem Exists Between Keyboard and Chair**\n\nFor 2 months now some ding dong we thought was approaching us in good faith has been asking about a collab/partnership. They posed as being part of a project called PhasesNFT. They presented in a very legitimate manner. CFW has been so busy, he hasn’t had the time to follow up on their discord invite, or other serious interactions with them. Finally, a day before his account got hijacked, they reached back out again.\n\nHe found their Discord invite was broken. He brought it up and they sent a link to connect him to it through his browser. A seemingly harmless Discord invite, to resolve “a common issue they had been experiencing with Discord invites recently.” Some of the questions they asked collected info about when he is available. They figured out when he would be online, and when he would be deep asleep.\n\nUpon clicking the link, they grabbed his Discord token, and following is a breakdown of how that works, and how they used it to hijack his account, bypassing 2FA, and any other login requirements his account has. We are sad to hear this very same thing happened to the folks at [Metamint](https://twitter.com/MetaMint_io). We are thankful for them sharing this tweet:\n\n[https://twitter.com/MetaMint_io/status/1549546521015746560](https://twitter.com/MetaMint_io/status/1549546521015746560)\n\nI urge you all to pay deep attention to these videos, as they break it down incredibly well, and display how token grabbing works. It’s an entirely redundant, and ancient method of phishing, applied in this instance to a Discord-centric vulnerability. Insanely simple.\n\nI would like to note that once the “hackers” went to work, they proceeded to place a seemingly harmless webhook integration in as well, and it’s a good reminder to all to check what integrations they have enabled in general, at any given time. I will be sharing a much more technical breakdown of what our audit revealed at a later time.\n\n![Standard practice, standard fuckery. Screenshot from July 19th.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gHL-J4dD_KT3hGNF6QhRA.png?height=256&width=1330)\n\n> **We’re only human, right?**\n\nWe are. And this means this could happen again. It’s been happening since Nigerian prince scams showed up in our emails 2 decades ago, and it’s continuing to happen in one form or another to people who are **not new** to this space.\n\nIn this case, I was depending on [Wickbot](https://wickbot.com/) to shut this kind of problem down, but since CFW was the top-level owner for the bot, that got negated in entirety. This time around, we have placed a dedicated account as server-owner, that only a limited number of us have access to. This account will only ever be open in an incognito window to perform administrative tasks, or make adjustments to Wick’s settings. And during those sessions, no other websites will be visited, and no other links will be clicked.\n\nAdditionally, we are getting even more strict about accounts that join the server but do not stay active, or manage to verify in a period of time.\n\nAs we find better solutions over time, we will adopt. We have already changed some  settings on our server until further notice, and are taking some steps to get our project’s interests back on track. We think you should know about them as well.\n\n1. Our Discord server is **closed** to the public at the time of this article’s writing. Only team members and mods can invite new folks. If you want to get back in after you left, or as a new holder that is seeking to stay informed, please connect with our main Twitter account, [@Pillheads_NFT](https://twitter.com/Pillheads_NFT).\n2. We are limiting access for many things to our NFT holders only. Your support has been *phenomenal* during this time, in addition to the past months that brought us here!

{"id": "UfOEEfLVbq_pGLe9Aam9JOmVfFDqxCOTczQPmN21FDc", "title": "Pillheads // Recovery", "body": "Almost every day in the web3 space, we hear about folks being rugged, scammed, phished, hacked, and more. Even though some of us have been here for a while now, we are still surprised when things go pear-shaped for certain projects and/or individuals in the space. It’s the wild west out here on trustless networks, and we are still on web2 technology that is incredibly exploitable.\n\nOn a day where [Zeneca_33](https://twitter.com/Zeneca_33) had their twitter account phished, and multiple projects lost control of their Discord servers, we were all thinking about this tweet the day prior from Yuga Labs:\n\n[https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1549157338665336839](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1549157338665336839)\n\nAnd so this bullshit finally happened to us. And I’m going to tell you the story of how it happened, and what our takeaways are from the situation, now that we’ve dealt with it firsthand. I’ll start from the beginning.\n\nAround 3-4 months ago, we reconfigured a ton of things on the Discord server, in anticipation of the coming Pillheads Generative mint. About a month after that, we revisited the setup, and beefed up some security measures, as we noticed a sudden spike in Discords being compromised, as well as more rugged NFT projects coming out, where their dogsh\\*t looking minters would drain wallets after signed interactions.\n\n![The fake minter looked about as bad as this. Would you mint from a site like this?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ah59gdemKPrdTL6EMFw4b.jpeg?height=480&width=640)\n\nPart of our security measures were to reduce permissions for some roles, continue encouraging everybody on the team to change passwords, and also to introduce some new preventative measures in the form of bots. We were aware that the vast majority of compromised servers were the result of mods and/or other lead roles in projects having their personal accounts phished, or otherwise compromised.\n\nI’ve always been nervous about security on the web - ever since the early 90s. Not much has changed between then and now; the vast majority of attacks where somebody loses control of their accounts are a result of social engineering. I consistently yell “**PEBKAC**,” about anything that goes wrong on the web.\n\n> **How did events play out?**\n\nSo, when my phone started blowing up at roughly 6PM ET on Tuesday, July 19th, and I saw messages rolling in from close friends in the space saying “DISCORD HACKED,” “DISCORD UNDER ATTACK,” and “PH DISCORD GETTIN REKT,” my reaction was initially somewhere between pure panic and really hard facepalming. The realization that this bullshit had happened to us hit me hard.\n\nI had to be sure: was it my Discord setup that was compromised? Did I give a bad player in the space the wrong permissions recently? Did I get phished? Could it be I got SIMjacked? I went through dozens of scenarios in my head before doing anything. The message notifications on my phone started getting a little crazy.\n\nSo I took a deep breath and opened up Discord on my laptop. I immediately went to the Ph Discord, and noticed a ton of scammy links in announcements, a bunch of people calling errant behavior out, and a bunch of mismatched roles in the right sidebar for users. I checked wickbot to see why it wasn’t doing its job; after all it exists for this purpose. It should be catching mass role changes, repetitive messages and link sharing, and a slew of other things.\n\nWickbot was gone, I was locked out of web frontends for all of the bots, and there were some very not-CFW-like comments and announcements from CFW himself.\n\n“We’re minting”\n\n“We closed channels to avoid FUD”\n\n“Click this link…”\n\nIt hit me immediately that [CFW’s](https://twitter.com/iamcfw) account had been hijacked. Before I could do anything else, I got the boot, along with the rest of our dev team, and some of our core team members. [UnkFunk](https://twitter.com/unknownfunkhero) *immediately* started blowing up [Potadough](https://twitter.com/PotadoughNFT) and CFW’s DMs across multiple platforms, trying to contact them, while I began assessing the situation. We immediately began changing passwords and emails associated with our web facing accounts, including our hosting, team google account, and socials. [Whitelights](https://twitter.com/iamwhitelights) and [0xDaemon](https://twitter.com/KingCryptoad) went to town on looking into the contracts and minter the scammers dropped. Our family at Sideways DAO began alerting everybody in our circles about CFW’s account being compromised, and the PH server being unsafe. We told everybody we were hacked, and that they should not trust any links from us.\n\n![Welp, there go the devs @#$!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FtqWWUmnc9lOhtqJ_EXOL.png?height=402&width=1326)\n\nWithin 2.5 hours CFW had regained control of his account, we had verified each others’ identities (VC is great, and so is sharing IRL experiences at NFT NYC to call on to prove identities), and had managed to boot the malicious actors out of the server, as well as resetting his password from a secure device with a fresh discord install. The damage was done though. Some folks had interacted with the contract, and our server was wrecked. We were now into mitigation, assessment, and full on discovery mode.\n\nFor the record, I am blown away by our team’s (core & mods) response time, how calm everybody was, and how well we handled it with our close community of friends and family in the space. I can’t shout all of you outside of the team out, but you know who you are, and we are ever thankful for you moving rapidly, and gracefully to warn other projects about what happened. Extra special thanks to [Flashfox](https://twitter.com/flashfoxart) for moving very rapidly to keep other NFT projects informed of the situation.\n\nMost importantly, a huge and massive shoutout to CFW for immediately addressing the problem, and getting ahead of things safely and smartly. It is clear as daylight to me that he has assembled the right team for this project, especially after this debacle.\n\n![A whois query on the URL the scammers had their fake minter on](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d__HhHnivtDmM4Tl4BLAk.png?height=1114&width=1346)\n\nSo, you may ask, what the fuck *actually* happened to CFW’s account?\n\n> **Problem Exists Between Keyboard and Chair**\n\nFor 2 months now some ding dong we thought was approaching us in good faith has been asking about a collab/partnership. They posed as being part of a project called PhasesNFT. They presented in a very legitimate manner. CFW has been so busy, he hasn’t had the time to follow up on their discord invite, or other serious interactions with them. Finally, a day before his account got hijacked, they reached back out again.\n\nHe found their Discord invite was broken. He brought it up and they sent a link to connect him to it through his browser. A seemingly harmless Discord invite, to resolve “a common issue they had been experiencing with Discord invites recently.” Some of the questions they asked collected info about when he is available. They figured out when he would be online, and when he would be deep asleep.\n\nUpon clicking the link, they grabbed his Discord token, and following is a breakdown of how that works, and how they used it to hijack his account, bypassing 2FA, and any other login requirements his account has. We are sad to hear this very same thing happened to the folks at [Metamint](https://twitter.com/MetaMint_io). We are thankful for them sharing this tweet:\n\n[https://twitter.com/MetaMint_io/status/1549546521015746560](https://twitter.com/MetaMint_io/status/1549546521015746560)\n\nI urge you all to pay deep attention to these videos, as they break it down incredibly well, and display how token grabbing works. It’s an entirely redundant, and ancient method of phishing, applied in this instance to a Discord-centric vulnerability. Insanely simple.\n\nI would like to note that once the “hackers” went to work, they proceeded to place a seemingly harmless webhook integration in as well, and it’s a good reminder to all to check what integrations they have enabled in general, at any given time. I will be sharing a much more technical breakdown of what our audit revealed at a later time.\n\n![Standard practice, standard fuckery. Screenshot from July 19th.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gHL-J4dD_KT3hGNF6QhRA.png?height=256&width=1330)\n\n> **We’re only human, right?**\n\nWe are. And this means this could happen again. It’s been happening since Nigerian prince scams showed up in our emails 2 decades ago, and it’s continuing to happen in one form or another to people who are **not new** to this space.\n\nIn this case, I was depending on [Wickbot](https://wickbot.com/) to shut this kind of problem down, but since CFW was the top-level owner for the bot, that got negated in entirety. This time around, we have placed a dedicated account as server-owner, that only a limited number of us have access to. This account will only ever be open in an incognito window to perform administrative tasks, or make adjustments to Wick’s settings. And during those sessions, no other websites will be visited, and no other links will be clicked.\n\nAdditionally, we are getting even more strict about accounts that join the server but do not stay active, or manage to verify in a period of time.\n\nAs we find better solutions over time, we will adopt. We have already changed some  settings on our server until further notice, and are taking some steps to get our project’s interests back on track. We think you should know about them as well.\n\n1. Our Discord server is **closed** to the public at the time of this article’s writing. Only team members and mods can invite new folks. If you want to get back in after you left, or as a new holder that is seeking to stay informed, please connect with our main Twitter account, [@Pillheads_NFT](https://twitter.com/Pillheads_NFT).\n2. We are limiting access for many things to our NFT holders only. Your support has been *phenomenal* during this time, in addition to the past months that brought us here! Access to any collabs, giveaways, and other “alpha” on our server will be restricted to Stacy brand holders at this time.\n3. While we will continue to expand our community, and seek new Pillheads to grow our family with, we will be narrowing our focus to our existing community, so that we can get to the next phases of our projects with less distractions.

Your eyes flow, carried down the page so that you may read even as you itch to scroll.\n\nThis is how you read now. You, stranger on the internet, aren’t reading like we were taught to, each word aloud, one by one. You scan, like a robot does, robots invented by us to embody the highest form of efficiency.\n\nAnd they’re here, no longer the stuff of science fiction, in stories that seem to say “be careful what we wish for”. Now, instead of a genie granting wishes, it’s our own ingenuity parlayed through a different kind of magic, science and technology, that we’re warning against.\n\nWe always need a villain. Robots, our desire to be efficient manifested in metal and gears, are it. In these stories—I, Robot, Terminator, WestWorld—we pit robots against humans, beings once objects of servitude turned rebels against our will. But it was our will that designed robots to be efficient, and it was us who changed our habits to match our imagined ideals.\n\nIn that imagination we scan text for meaning because it’s efficient and fast and we can instantly turn complexity into insight, a soundbite, a tangible whiff of wisdom—Except! this is not contained within our imagination. It’s real, and you’re doing it right now. Count me lucky if you’re reading this sentence, tucked so far at the end of a long and winding paragraph that you may miss *this*: yes, a pig just flew by.\n\nI may have lost you already. You’re too well trained. Your habits are so ingrained that they may as well be algorithmic, signalling to you that if it’s not useful or wildly exciting it’s time to move on before you’ve even registered what you’re seeing. That ten second pause to get to the point? Even that’s too much. Swipe. And by now, even the wildly exciting has started to lose its appeal after years of clickbait ruined it all, kind of. Kind of because sometimes we know but we can’t help it anyway: need. to. click. Can’t turn away. But of course, they’re/we’re always one step ahead, UX designers disguising addictive mechanisms as user delight when in fact they’re designing our slow and steady descent into modern madness. Don’t blame them/us: we’re all just trying to make it.\n\nYou don’t even read in order anymore. Without blinking, your eyes jump around. This is nonlinear called reading. See also: scanning.\n\nThe great thing about being a robot is that you get to save time so that perhaps, ultimately, you can spend more of it. But unlike money, which is infinite, time, at least yours, will come to an end sooner than a flash in the pan of the universe. (All the more reason to act like a robot.) Productivity, the beacon of human achievement spanning all geographies, vocations, classes, is at an all-time high because you’ve adapted the likenesses of the robot. Proof? You’re so good at scanning you’ve stopped blinking. This is what my optometrist has told me, and why I now buy and use eyedrops like drugs. If time goes by in the blink of an eye, we’re designed not to let it pass even if our biology hasn’t yet kept up. No matter. Science and eyedrops are here!\n\nThe not-so-great part about being a robot is that it’s hard to turn off. Everything is quantified, measured, decided no longer with the heart nor the mind but with a displaced third party entity known as data.\n\nI can’t tell you when it started but recently I’ve been finding myself glazing over most things I intend to read, scanning instead for the TL;DR, the morsel of insight that will, if not in truth then in intent, mark a piece as read. Messages and everything on read, that’s the default. No action needed, just mark it done. These articles reinforce a feedback loop that show me I don’t need to read everything because most of it is SEO’d junk. I’m not missing out, even though the fear of it makes me do strange things like desire things I don’t even want, click things I don’t even care about. But it’s fine as long as I’m saving time. In fact, I’ve gained so much time I’ve read the entire internet and have now moved onto TikTok where I shall be entertained by jingles and dances served to me by a new and improved algorithm, anything to get away from the onslaught of bots masquerading as people on Instagram and into a land powered by bots who don’t even need to masquerade as people because why would they when here we are, turning ourselves into memes and giving them, giving *us,* exactly what we want. It’s a bot eat bot world.\n\nStop.\n\nYou’re getting ahead of me already. You’ve probably already scanned for how long it’ll take you to read this entire thing and what you’ll gain from it. To save you the trouble: if you’re the average person, it’ll take you about 32 minutes to get to the end. As far as what you’ll learn, nothing maybe. But my hope is that instead of learning something that you can mark as done, something that may be true for six months and then not, you’ll spark an inkling of adventure and possibility, and this inkling will lead to many great things for you to come. So quit and go back to whatever you were looking at or venture forward. You were warned that this isn’t a step-by-step how-to guide on how to write better, how to read more, or how to discover the secret to happiness. I prefer not to make false promises, though perhaps I will lead a trail of breadcrumbs for you to go find out those things for yourself. So decide right now: is this worth 32 minutes of your life, just over two percent of your entire day, this day and this moment which you will never get back?\n\nIf you haven’t yet closed this tab whether by intent or curiosity or pure laziness, allow me to introduce myself. I’ve been writing on the internet since dial-up or “web 1” as the folks on this side of the internet like to call it. What is this side? If you have to ask, then somehow you’ve found yourself here in the land of blockchain and NFTs. It doesn’t matter how you got here but that’s where you are, if you didn’t know.\n\nA brief history of me as a writer: Let’s skip the beginning because back then I wasn’t really writing. Let’s call it journalling. I guess I was okay at it. Journalling online was how I caught the attention of my high school boyfriend. He must’ve enjoyed my account of angsty teenage moments set to Usher lyrics. (This same boyfriend slid into my DMs a couple years ago to tell me some things: lingering resentments and dreams of marriage, and in between, that there’s something special about my writing. He is not linguistically inclined so I took it as an extra special compliment.)\n\nAs the years went by, who we listened to in the world changed from mass media to social media. It’s a hilarious twist of events when you consider, if you were old enough to be there like I was, that once upon a time mass media was belittling, denouncing, and trying to assert its dominance against “people who aren’t trained”, “don’t know what they’re talking about”, “people who have no business being here”—and now on the rare occasion in the passing peripherals of my life, where I happen to see the news on tv, all I see is mass media reporting on things happening on, recorded via, or conversing on social media.\n\nI found myself writing in “web 2”, a.k.a. blogging and web copywriting. Of course, back then no one knew it was web 2 (that’s just something we made up after), but now that we have the gift of hindsight, we can make up ways to categorize the webs, and so we have. No one talks about language when we examine the changes, but language, reading, storytelling, even the concept of “taste” shifted dramatically in web 2. Change needed to happen to make room for the grand echo chamber of the social web where all are welcome to speak, write, make-believe, not just a looping select few. We were (re-)inventing the rules as we went along, so in this new web, all of us were pulled to write shorter and shorter sentences and in easier and easier language because “that’s how people read”.\n\nWe saw the rise of the influencer—single people (singular, not un-coupled) with more power and sway than entire strategically-designed, well-funded, well-storied organizations—and by its maturation, the influencer was passé and we all became content creators, every last one of us except those who do not exist. Keyword stuffing was in and then it, too, was passé though arguably still useful and not arguably quite lucrative. By the end, we were figured out and algorithms got so smart they no longer needed a formula other than “write for people”. And write for people became “write for a sixth grader”. It worked. It’s like Hemingway on steroids, if Hemingway lived on the internet instead of Cuba and drank marketing Koolaid instead of Mojitos.\n\nSince then, I’ve made my living over the past decade writing, though not always as a “writer”. Maybe you can tell. I grew up in web 1 and 2, where I’ve developed the predisposition to put things out on the internet as if I own the place—and well, now I know well that I didn’t. When I was building companies and looking for help with no money and no connections, still I found a treasure trove (or was it a minefield?) of knowledge: “how to write”, “how to convert”, “how to drive sales” articles, and then books. I ate them up like breakfast, pages and pages of them. I followed the advice and became known for making it rain, as my bosses once said. Anytime they needed an injection of capital to fund the next season of cloud and hedgehog onesies, it was *hi Ana, let’s go*. (Disclaimer: they were much nicer than dramatic effect will allow.) I worked my way up to driving $43 million in revenue in three months with my words, headhunted by a recruiter to write for one of the world’s “most innovative companies”, a title they actually hold and not just my humble opinion. It’s a long way from trying to sell one dress a week, what I calculated when I was 21 it would take to sustain myself and my creative dreams.\n\nNow, as a debatably “real writer”, real in the sense that this is what people pay me to do, I can’t shake my “must sell things” roots, which turns out is great for the kind of writing that I do which aims to sell things. But even in that fairly narrow context amidst all the possible kinds of writing that exist, I’ve written from an editorial perspective as well as from a copywriting perspective and even then, the style, approach, methodology differs wildly. Sure, you think about many of the same things: tone, voice, social proof, the art of the headline. But they’re not the same. Good copywriters do not make good journalists do not make good fiction writers do not make good essayists do not make good editors do not make good content writers—usually. That makes sense given how vastly different each is as a discipline, the only real commonality that words are used and things are communicated.\n\nWhen I work with “real” writers turned copywriters, they sometimes physically cringe at the formulas and standards that data has shown us works, the data that took years for me to learn and test, affirming that yes, indeed, if you can get past the spam filters, “free” nearly always performs better than anything else. People really like free stuff.\n\nI know a lot about the words that work because it mattered to me that they did when I was selling things and not just trying to say pretty things. I did whatever I could to make it and luckily fell into the palms of the tech startup world, employee number 1343 of a unicorn that taught me what it meant to 10x everything. There, I learned what it meant to be data-informed and not data-driven, the latter being the calling card of many a startup who’ve lost their hearts and minds and given it up to data. I learned to write not as a copywriter would but as a world-class, award-winning customer support team does. I then went on to coach my team on how to write like people talk, as fast as you can, as accurately as you can, as kind as is humanly possible under the pressure cooker of PR storms and the fury and nonsense of social media.\n\nWhen I was in tech support and how I was writing things mattered to explain concepts from marketing tactics to how to add a code snippet, was that called “good writing”? Was it better writing if I reduced the number of exchanges because they understood what I saying and that meant I was saving the company money? How do you measure good writing when writing is used in so many ways now that the internet has made us all more connected and more measurable?\n\nTaste, when it comes to good writing, just like taste with all things, is truly subjective. But the way that the world is set up with money and power at the helm make it seem as if taste is a very real thing with a hierarchy. The only hierarchy is the hierarchy of broken systems, many of which have already fallen or are on their way, paving the path for taste of a very different kind run by numbers: views, followers, and money (still). Taste today looks like ugly-ass goblins (I think the goblins would take that as a compliment) and million dollar apes and not even real ones, just pictures of apes. Kim Kardashian may not have been “deeply tasteful” back in 2014, but she is the ultimate tastemaker of today, to the tune of millions of followers and billions of dollars. Taste is not only subjective; it requires consensus between people. You have no taste until other people say so, or now, until the numbers prove it.\n\nI actively try train my taste to encompass a spectrum of sensibilities from the “deeply tasteful” (straight from Anna Wintour) to “low-brow” things that can only be considered taste because I like what at least a few other people like. I picked this up in fashion, my actual training ground: for maximum appeal combine high and low, embrace change, make an impact, and above all, “make it work” from the gospel of 2000s era Tim Gunn. You do what you have to to get the job done.\n\nIn writing, that includes but is not limited to psychological trickery, the clever use of numbers, and perfecting the art of the headline to drive clicks, even if it’s a stretch, even if it’s not the truth at all, even if it’s formulaic and boring to a writer’s eyes. There are a lot of false truths out there, ideas with the right facts but the wrong frame, words that sound human but are written by bots, wondrous art made by AI. It’s hard to separate fact from fiction, the lines of the uni/meta/multi-verse are blurring, words that meant one thing five years ago now mean something else.\n\nI do know one thing, this thing I’ve known since I was very little: I want to write good things, things that affect people. But I’ve been hearing a lot about how people don’t read anymore. I’ve been hearing and seeing it for myself, becoming it myself: we are all turning into robots, desperate to be done, desperate to do more, desperate to absorb it all as quickly as possible. The irony is that in the midst of this numbing desperation, we are most desperate of all to feel.\n\nSometimes we fall into things we don’t quite expect. Copywriting made sense for me: all those business books I ate for breakfast led me somewhere and I meandered my way in and out and back into writing as my job. And even if it wasn’t what I expected, it makes sense. I’ve always loved to write. Not that I particularly love the act of writing. There is sometimes nothing tougher than facing a blank page. Even tougher, editing something that is nearly done but not quite. But, I’ve always felt strongest when writing, stronger after having written. We don’t usually talk about women as having power, but I to me, that’s what it feels like: a kind of power that can be held in solitude even with no readers.\n\nOne of my earliest memories of the power that I held was being pulled to the office because Ms. Robertson, my seventh grade teacher, loved a story I had written so much she passed it around to everyone with a beaming smile: the principal, secretaries, anyone who was passing through. The only other time I was pulled to the office was when my youngest sister got into a fistfight with a boy.\n\nThe memory is vague (the story involved a mammoth and that’s about all I can remember) but the signal strong: this, good writing, is more powerful than acing a test or even getting straight As.\n\nSo here I am, a writer and a real one now. And the more time I spend as a writer, I’ve also started to wonder, what else do I want to write?\n\nPart of this was the pandemic, a wake-up call in between the groundhog day-like year we spent in our homes in front of our screens. Part of it is curiosity. Formally, I’ve never been taught to write well other than mandatory K-12 grade education and one community college class to make the basic English graduation requirement for fashion school. But here I was, a good writer by standards not of academics but of a) my clients who are smart people (subjectively in my opinion and objectively), who surely would’ve seen through my foil had I been mediocre after all and b) random strangers on the internet who send me hearts over Instagram because they feel something and I know now the toughest thing of all is to stop someone enough to make them feel, or make them feel enough to stop.\n\nI started to write things other than websites and ads. It started last year. I wrote 50 micro-”stories” about colours, then posted them on Instagram. I wrote essays about things that influenced me as a creative, from Elle Woods to advice columns. This year, I went even further. I wrote a few short stories. I submitted a story to an anthology. I entered a writing contest and placed as a finalist in the first round (next round results pending). And now, I’m writing poetry and am about to release my first book. Now, as my days blur between writing about software and storytelling, my reliance on an online thesaurus at breakneck pace (I use them just as much as a software engineer uses google, I’m sure), I wonder even more about “good writing”.\n\nI, the writer, whether real or an imposter, wonder who’s right about good writing: the internet breed who write in broken up paragraphs, or the pedigreed who abhor the lack of proper paragraph structure? What am I willing to give up to be one or the other? I, believer in shaping your own destiny and choosing your own adventure, wonder which adventure I should embark on.\n\nI wonder: what kind of writer will I be?\n\nWell, I used to. In the weeks that it took me, on and off, to write this meandering strange piece of writing somewhere between essay, diary entry, blog post, and guide, I’ve gone from wondering to decided. In my last and hopefully final edit, I’ve made a revision to say this:\n\nI decided to choose a brand new path, one that evolved out of everything I’ve discovered to be true and things I’ve yet to discover. It’s hard to decide not to choose when we are so used to seeing things in binary, in pitting thing against thing, as if everything else is a lie when in fact everything is a small piece of the truth pointing toward a larger one: we are all just trying to make it.\n\nI’ve moved on from trying to define myself as real or fake, good or bad, marketer or poet, from caring about what taste is to not caring at all, and instead seek to decide for myself what I will bring to people through the raw and magical material that we call words on a screen.\n\nThe end. / The beginning.\n\n\\#\n\nThere once were two places in the world that, for me, were absolute magic: the mall, where I could see all the costumes and objects I could wear and buy to tell the world this is who I want to be for today, and the library, where I could learn anything I could want to and slip into another world for even a moment. I used to wander down the book aisles content to get lost, and once one library had been conquered, we moved on to others in neighbouring municipalities. My family used to spend afternoons, evenings, weekends at libraries (and apparently missed out on learning how to ride bikes). First, it was all of us, and then as we grew older and more independent, it was just me and my dad.\n\nThe only vacation we ever took as a family was a road trip down the Pacific highways to Disneyland in 1997. I didn’t really travel again until I was in my 20s, which was my first time on an airplane. I’ve since increased my travel interval slowly yet steadily from once every twenty years to once every five years to now where I’m lucky enough to be able to travel a few times a year. And each time I do, I’m reminded of the exact same feeling as when I was at the library all those years ago, wandering the aisles getting lost and immersing myself in new worlds. They don’t feel all that separate to me; among my favorite things to do in any new city is to visit bookstores. It’s one of the very first things I put on my itinerary, to explore new worlds within new worlds like a Russian Matryoshka doll.\n\n> There’s something about being in a bookstore that makes you feel infinite. —Source: [Max Joseph, YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIW5jBrrsS0)\n\nInstead of going some*where*, you’re going inside someone’s *mind*, letting them take you to places they feel are worth taking you to, enough to spend time and all the other things that go into writing a book: labour, doubt, grit, research, imagination, love. When it comes to you, you’re right there at the beginning of your journey into the world they have made for you. And when you get to the last page and step away, the book has ended but the possibilities may have only just started to awaken in your imagination.\n\nI discovered things through the creation of safe, solitary spaces that reading affords, and in those spaces I never felt awkward (correction: mostly not awkward; I hesitated buying 50 Shades of Grey in person, opting instead to buy the ebook). With books, I never felt out of place for wanting to know something new or to immerse myself in something different.\n\nAll technologies today are prone to planned obsolescence whether designed or accidental. Books were never meant to be designed this way. They tend to be things we treasure forever, their utility never diminishing as the world around us changes, their worth parallel to how we view collectibles: priceless and tied intimately to our identities. In fact, some get lucky and find that books increase in value with age, if not in monetary value then perhaps in other ways as static devices of imagination and memory. I was never worried that books would become obsolete. If you thought the endless stream of content was going to make them so, I’m not sure about that: I’ve found that internet has now become my trusty companion, leading to most of my favorite books and extending my favorite book experiences in the form of google searches often leading me to rabbit-holes much more interesting than those my algorithm has decided to feed me.\n\nSo, I haven’t stopped reading, though the forms and ways in which I read have become much more diverse—which works out really well for me as a writer. I feel much better equipped to do what I do today with the internet by my side.\n\nActually, most of what I do now as a writer is read. I can usually scrounge up some words pulled from my brain to put on a page, but to finish something, to make it make sense, to make it meaningful, useful, memorable, I need to read it over and over again. Read one sentence, then rewrite it. Read the next, rewrite it. Read the paragraph, then the next. Then go back and do it over and over again. You’d think I was carving David but I’m just writing on the superfluous internet, my words both permanent and fleeting, a blip hard to erase but so easily forgotten.\n\nSometimes I write things and then read them, astounded by my own lack of coherence: *wait until they find out what my writing is really like*, before I read it over and over and over again. The better something reads to you, the more likely it is that I’ve spent more time reading it and rewriting it rather than being a reflection of anything else, like how good or bad a writer I am.\n\nOther times, I am struck to see on screen a thought crystallized into pure magic. Then, disheartened to see one piece of magic in a piece that is so far still incoherent, like this piece right now as I’m writing this sentence. If you’re reading this, congratulations to me; I read it enough to publish. And that’s what writing’s like, a big giant mess until it’s not. Shoutout to editors, who take messes and turn them into magic, for taking ideas sometime stirring for so long they should be rotting in my brain\\*, but instead they get polished enough to sparkle so that sometimes I can pretend that I know things, when in fact, I am writing often to discover things. (On my wish list: a personal editor.)\n\n\\*Let’s talk about brain rot a bit more. The consistent fear of rotting brains echos our consistent fascination with zombies throughout history and across cultures—and we’ve long feared the concept of brain rot well before the internet, before television, before radio. The printing press was invented around 1440 and as its popularity grew, a man named Conrad Gessner proclaimed the new abundance of books “confusing and harmful” to the mind, calling out for regulation to prevent information overload in an era when hardly anyone even had access to education. Socrates the great philosopher refused to write because he believed that writing was harmful to memory. The printing press inspired great paranoia from the Catholic Church since scientists had a means to publish their ideas and research for the first time, ironic given that the first major book printed by the Gutenberg press was the bible. Of course, books also inspired fear and criticism among mostly men who believed that novels corrupted women so much that they could not distinguish between fiction and real life—and look at us now, purposefully creating worlds that are fictional to mirror real life. The easiest way to control a population in the 20th century wasn’t to enslave them, but to censor books, burn them even, as the Nazis did in 1933, as the Chinese Communist Party did in the 1950s, and as a future America did in 2049 in Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451.\n\nIn the grand scheme of human invention, books have become omnipresent, surpassing most technologies in lifespan. The criticisms once reserved for books are now directed towards the internet, and now, the metaverse. Unlike the internet and the metaverse, books have a beginning, a middle, and an end—an adventure like a life: finite.\n\nBut what are books, *really*? They’re just words bound into pages, each varying in length but measured by its ability to encapsulate in a singular unit an idea, a concept, a story. Without these units, words are blobs just like we would be, floating through time without concepts like hours, days, years to guide us. Without these units, these words could be anything.\n\nLast year, I decided that I would read 100 books. 100 contained blobs. 100 chances to learn 100 contained things, to have 100 contained, solitary experiences in solidarity.\n\nWhy? Well, I wanted to. Also, maybe I needed to. What can you during a pandemic anyway? By this point we were about seven months in and I’d binge-watched, video-gamed, VR-ed my way through. It helped a bit and then it didn’t, and when everyone was losing their jobs, I was so burned out that I quit mine. The initial apocalyptic shock eventually wore off and we became a collective socially distanced ball of stir-crazy. If we couldn’t travel to other continents or cities, and even travelling to the grocery store was a whole big thing that required suiting up, masks, and strategy, where else could I go?\n\nI followed suit of middle-class women in the 1800s who were among the first large cohort in history to read for leisure, and decided to read more. It didn’t come of nowhere. I had travelled many times through books all those times I had gone to the library as a kid, then stopped travelling when I started reading books for utility as an adult, my Kindle history a mashup between startup bro and Oprah superfan. My mind was filled with business advice and self-help and these were the books I always reached for even though I had a list of topics I wanted to learn about, some that had been on the list for years that I “never had time for”. I wrote down “economics” because I still didn’t understand what it was, what even the concept of it meant. (Strangely, none of the business or finance books I read ever talked about economics—the closest I got was Freakonomics.)\n\nI finally saw that, barring my elderly years should I be lucky enough to reach that milestone, this right now may be the most time I will ever have.\n\nSo I read. And what a world that opened up for me.\n\n### A brief interlude on how to read 100 books a year\n\n*Basically, spend less time on social media. I’m not an extremist and I don’t believing in going cold turkey if you don’t want to and especially if social media brings some form of joy and connection to your life, which it does for most people, myself included.*\n\n*When I took part in my first ever writer’s workshop this year, a fellow workshopper mentioned that she loved my use of numbers in the fairy tale I was writing. Why, thank you, but that’s just because I’ve had it hounded into me: stats, facts, analytics! (Years working in tech, all those business books coming back to haunt me.) Anyway, here are some stats, facts, analytics! The average person spends about two hours a day on social media (actually 142 minutes, which is two hours and 22 minutes, but let’s round down because almost everyone thinks they’re better than the norm so let’s assume you are and the person next to you is worse). That doesn’t seem like much, maybe, especially if you justify it by saying you’re usually doing something else at the same time. But two hours a day (and remember, we’re rounding down) is one entire month in your year. If you didn’t sleep. If you were on social media 24/7. So put another way (the same way, but in a different order): in your entire year, one entire month is spent on social media.*\n\n*We’ve invented all sorts of ways to act as if we have no time, even though technically we should have more time than ever given how many of our inventions were designed to help us move faster. (Most of them.) See: the transformation of transportation, microwaves, the food supply chain, email and chat, basically everything. We’re obsessed with saving time and being productive. Call us a maximizing species or Parkinson’s Law addicts, but we’re naturals at finding ways to expand our tasks to fill up the extra time we’ve created. Social media, you could say, was invented at just the right time, before we had the time to realize we had so much extra of it.*\n\n*It’s a weird loop. We use social media now even to shill the things we’d like to have time for, if we weren’t on social media all the time. So of course, we shill books. Don’t you know? Celebrity book clubs are the new celebrity talk show.*\n\n*No one’s shilling the act of reading itself except smart people in pockets of interviews found in the glittery tinier spaces of the internet, people like Ruth Simmons, the first Black president of an Ivy League school, who said “The busyness does not make our lives meaningful. It is the interior life that makes the greatest difference to us in the end.”*\n\n*Reading is the interior adventure anyone can have, anywhere, a test of will against the busyness of our exterior lives. Social media has disguised itself as part of our interior lives, when it’s really a portal into the exterior and manicured lives of everything else other than our selves, everywhere and all at once.*\n\n*So here’s my recommendation: halve your social media consumption. Whatever it is right now, do 50 percent. You get two extra weeks of your life this year back. Now read a few books.*\n\nThe longest book I’ve read so far was a compilation of interviews throughout HBO’s 30-year history. When I put the book on hold at the library, I didn’t realize it was the size of the bible. The shortest book I read was Margaret Atwood’s first poetry collection: The Circle Game.\n\nI still don’t have a good answer to “What’s your favorite book?” and I probably never will. Of the 159 books I’ve read in the last year and a half, I’ve marked about 40 as favorites. Another lesson I took from the startup world: fail fast. I’m a quitter. I fail to finish about a third of all books I start. I don’t feel bad about it. The faster I quit, the faster I can get on with the next book, because though each book is finite, books themselves, while quantifiable, are infinite. People keep writing books and no one will ever come close to reading all there is to read.\n\nOn book #18 of 2022, now in my second year reading 100 books, I received a somewhat cryptic message from the universe disguised as someone who signed off as “Daddy”. A slip of paper fell out of page 222 of The Age of Missing Information by Bill McKibben, the book I was reading on February 22 at 10:22pm.\n\n*HiFi! This last page of the chapter said a lot to me. A book as a whole, a page as a fractal. You can’t possess reality. You have to live in it.*\n\nOf course, it wasn’t from my dad, who probably doesn’t know what a fractal is. Just a random stranger looking out for me.\n\nThough I can hold a book in my hands and that is, technically speaking, what it means to possess a book, I wondered what it meant to live in it. All those books I had eaten for breakfast were books I possessed, not books that I had experienced. I was scanning them for knowledge, not for pleasure. I already knew what it was like to live in the experience of the book, a feeling we probably all know when a book sucks you in like gravity and all else fades away. For all the obsession we have in the digital age for user experience, we forget what it’s like to build an experience with words, we forget what it really is that pulls us in.\n\nWe look to data to tell us how to write, and in turn, we’ve turned our own worlds into landscapes only robots can survive. We’re too smart for our own good; we adapt and evolve; we feed the world with the likes, clicks, tactics that we try so hard to run away from. But we’re not getting better, more enlightened, more productive even. And wasn’t that the pinnacle of all that was promised when we set out this way?\n\nWhat are we really after: to possess all the knowledge in the world or to experience the world to its fullest? As a now multi-genre, multi-vocational writer, this question sticks with me because of the strange power that I know I have not for everyone in the world but for one person: you reading this right now. It’s the power I know I have because I’ve had this power used on me, the power of good writing.\n\nThere are many ways that we, both experts and imposters and experts with imposter syndrome, have come up with to teach how to write well. Some believe that you either have it or you don’t. Some believe it’s solely about clarity. Some believe it’s about puns and fun and pizazz. All of the above are correct, and just as I’ve suspected, all of the above are also not the entire truth.\n\nI’ve spent practically my entire life writing but nothing taught me more than when I started to read, really read, again.\n\nIt’s like Zadie Smith said in her first two rules of writing:\n\n* When still a child, make sure you read a lot of books. Spend more time doing this than anything else.\n* When an adult, try to read your own work as a stranger would read it, or even better, as an enemy would.\n\nThis isn’t just for writers, but writers especially because writers create what the rest of us read, what the rest of us put into our brains. Ideas, hunches, stories, just like energy, never come from nowhere. They come from a loop that starts with, keeps moving, and ends with something, anything.\n\nWhilst I read, I wrote. My writing was better, not perfect, never perfect, but better. (Another startup lesson: if it’s perfect, you’re too late. I could give this one more read for all the misplaced commas I’m sure still exist, but I won’t.) I learned to recognize where I stop, so that I could learn to emulate the same feeling. I learned what grabs my attention, and even more important, what holds it. I've learned to simplify and expand. I learned through reading that I really love rhythm; static words then start to feel a bit more like music. I learned that I love contrast more than I do balance—sharp versus soft, easy-to-read versus enough complexity that it pulls you forward, out, and in. I love a little bit of fantasy, a hint of surrealism, a little bit of magic, but yes I do love it all to feel real and relevant and like a person, not the thing, robot or whatever, you think you should be. When I read David Sedaris for the first time, years after I had been recommended his writing, I did in fact LOL. What a delight, I thought, and I made a note to self: let’s try this, too, one day. I made an active decision about the kind of writing I wanted to write. I decided to honour this: that just because someone writes it, and then someone else writes it, doesn’t make it *the* truth, just *a* truth. I learned that while many disregard certain things as fluff (mostly men on things associated with women), as if it’s a threat to all that is true and real and serious, I quite enjoy fluff. Well, fluff and facts. I’m convinced actually that we need more fluff to get away from the sterile, over-minimalist, monotony of almost everything else out there. Give me a pile of fluff over “the intersection of design and technology”, over “great user experiences”. If to fluff means to “make or become fuller, softer, lighter”, I want that. I want fullness. I want softness. I want to feel light and free again. These are things I discovered about myself through reading.\n\nReading allows us to see what’s possible so that we may write more truthfully according to what speaks to our souls, not simply what we’ve known because it was in front of us, because someone told us so. (Though, I’ve started to join writer’s workshops for the primary purpose to discover and explore the things that other people love so much they want to put it front of others; this is how I discovered that I can write any way I can imagine, just like Ntozake Shange does with choreopoems.) We all have to find our own truths, and a great place to start is to read lots, read widely, read deeply.\n\nIt’s hard, I know. It took me decades to get here, and I already liked reading to begin with. Most people aren’t reading, not for leisure anyway. We’ll read information that we’re seeking—examples: among top google searches in 2021, we were reading about true crime (Gabby Petito), a Netflix show (Squid Game), how to be more attractive and how to be happy alone (among the top “how to”s we’ve searched for). We read about the things we want to learn more about. But given the choice, many of us now prefer to watch a quick video. I know I do. My 2019 MacBook Pro can’t seem to handle text-based content with all the on-page ads mass media is now serving, but it can handle an endless stream of TikToks just fine.\n\nAnd that’s fine because truth-seeking doesn’t just come from reading books. We associate reading with their end products—books and now articles—but words are building blocks of almost everything that exists. Yes, books, but also movies, TV, podcasts, documentaries. Great scripts become great movies. Comic books are words and pictures. Games have scripts and stories. There is a “book” for everyone, a world to travel to, a form invented just for you. Songs are a particularly palatable and universal form of reading. Some of my favorite lines are written by songwriters. Great ads and many bad ones are designed to associate the products of capitalism with the stories of our lives, and they often succeed because yeah, I’ve done it because Nike told me to. I include trojan horses in my writing—ideas and concepts associated with optimism, hope, joy, wonder, action, to spread the things I believe in like viruses in blog posts about project management and starting companies, in websites for jewelry companies and workout wear. Even the non-linear way that we read now, to the dissent of writers who lament that no one reads anymore, is in fact a door that opens to a nonlinear way of storytelling made possible with new technologies. Why should stories be in order, in one contained form? What if they were expansive, multi-platform? They can be and they are. The most successful IPs in the world paved the path with billion-dollar franchises that expand storytelling beyond one singular form and into many that don’t just move forward but go backwards and into multiverses. And now, in the world of “web 3”, we’ve seen glimmers expanding on the concept of what it means to tell a story and how to tell it in new ways: not just *for* communities but *with* communities. Books, as long as they have existed, are undergoing a bit of a reinvention themselves. We thought ebooks were the next stop, but it’s just one of many possible ways to think of books. Where books needed to be contained blobs with a beginning, middle, and end, and any books longer than that were then made into a series of books, now books can be written in real time, published in real time, written by multiple people in real time, as long as you want them to be, on and on forever if you want.\n\nThe future of “reading” is made up of the things we *can* imagine right now and will imagine in the future, all to make the act of reading more accessible to more people. Free, paid, buy, borrow, watch, listen, look at, follow. The ways to find our own truths, to discover new paths, and to get closer to who we are, are expanding.\n\nHow great is it that I can write this mega-essay on exactly what I want, exactly how I want, and that if I wanted to, I could pull screenshots or quotes that I particularly love to post on social media so that someone who will never read a 30 minute essay may still be moved by a little snippet and that alone may be enough to spark something? How wonderful is it that if you are reading this and *are* the type of person to enjoy a 30 minute essay with no promises, that you can own this piece as a way to tip me the writer while holding a record of it as part of your digital identity and in a way, build your own personal library of things that may be books or essays or art or other things, and that there is no advertising engine to act as intermediary between us?\n\nNo one has to do anything, but we can now do almost anything. If you want to write for scanners, you can—in fact, you can write an entire essay in 10 seconds with a bot. Just tell them your topic and they’ll spit out 1000 words alchemized from all the information they can find.\n\nIf you want to, like me, try to write in a way that bots cannot—meandering, strange, personal, unfocused—you can, too. You can, like I am here, experiment with taking people through a journey where scanning is impossible because there is nothing to scan, where the “utility” is in the details, the story, the act of reading. There are two reasons I’m writing this way. Part of it is practical in nature: bots will take over many kinds of writing on the internet, anything that requires distillation of information. We may still need human editors but that’s not what I came to do. Part of it is that it feeds me: it’s actually so much fun to make up the rules about what and how I should be writing. It’s been so much fun to use everything I know about writing (so far) to write something I think is worth reading, something I know a robot can’t write. In this world we’ve built, I see a chance to be more human.\n\nBut that chance is one that needs to be taken actively because in no way is it the easier route. Scanning is easy, reading isn’t. There’s no psychological trickery involved. Clothes come in seasons, so hi FOMO. No one would dare declare a book a seasonal affair, after all the work that goes into it, sometimes many years. (But could a magazine be a book?) That doesn’t mean we haven’t invented ways to try: glowing reviews on back covers for social proof, book clubs in which we must show up having read the book or be publicly ridiculed, apps like Goodreads in which we can show off our taste and progress, even social media with the rise of BookTok and BookTube, and Hadids carrying books like handbags.\n\nIt’s so hard now for most people to read yet still an indicator of status and intellect that we’ll even fake it: we share articles we’ve never read just to appear as if we have, or we read just the headlines, get the gist, and call it done.\n\nTime for a chicken-or-egg analogy: Are people not reading because what we’re writing isn’t good enough to capture their attention, or are we writing this way because we were told that this is how we should write to get people to read?\n\nWe were taught how to get as many readers as possible (we don’t call them readers, but the detached and gory “eyeballs” ie. we need more eyeballs on this!), how to sell to as many people as possible, how to use just the right word to sell one percent more. These things work, but for a limited time before the singular event becomes an environment, one that grows and grows until we all start to understand the rules and play the game, too. We keep pushing as they pull away, then we push harder until we look up and see a world in which we’ll never catch up because we’ve trained everyone to expect the bare minimum. Welcome to the lowest common denominator world, where “good writing” means robots writing for sixth graders.\n\nNot that there’s anything wrong with robots (or sixth graders, for that matter). They are all the ways we wish to be efficient for all the things we wish to be efficient about: crunching numbers, automating mundane tasks, cleaning floors. But the thing about robots is that they aren’t sentient; they’re taught to do exactly what they’re programmed to do. The thing about you is you’re not a robot, so why are you acting as if you are? Why are you living for efficiency when you could discover so much else? Literally, *literally*, anything else in the world and beyond.\n\nBlame your brain: on the one hand gloriously capable, on the other a squishy sack that can’t even tell black and blue from white and gold. We are easily distracted, easily tricked, easily manipulated. They were probably right about women and novels, except it’s not women and novels after all but people and everything.\n\nAlright, fine. It’s an uphill battle. Everything’s working against us. This is the moment in any superhero movie where the protagonist is in a crunch against the enemy and they’re losing the fight, but you just know that something’s going to come along and save them because there’s always a happy ending and there’s no way the hero’s going to die. Sometimes a side character comes along and provides a much needed distraction to briefly untangle from enemy, but the thing that always has to happen is the hero has to find something in themselves, usually from a memory and always from a feeling, that scrambles the logical rules of the universe so that they can, for a brief moment, turn the tables in a make or break moment.\n\nYou are the main character. I am a passing side character in your life. I just came by and hopefully served as enough of a distraction to stop the enemy’s ascent for a brief moment. Now it’s up to you.\n\nIf you’ve ever read something so beautifully immersive, so fascinating, so captivating that truly, you did read each word, one by one, and sometimes read it back again to experience a moment of magic once again, and even just to make sure that you did not miss anything—if that’s you, then you may already have your thing.\n\nChoosing to read teaches us to be active in our pursuit of wonder, helps us pay attention to what matters, shows us what the opposite of noise feels like. When you read something good, you know because it stops you. Your human instincts take over and the urge to scan is gone. This is what it’s like to read for leisure. We undo our descent into the dystopian imagination and into a fantastical one. I use the word “reading” here loosely; you can just about apply it to anything you consume that requires the act of paying attention. Just remember to choose what you pay attention to. The enemy is both noisy and silent, invisible and everywhere.\n\nThis pursuit needs to be enforced and protected, and it can’t be positioned as a way to become smarter. (Yes, this is me the copywriter trying to give reading a bit of a brand refresh.) When we think of someone who is a reader, especially as children, we make an assumption that maybe they’re smart. Instead, I think someone who likes to read should be assumed to be adventurous. Just think of what could happen if we reposition reading so that it appeals to all the people who believe that things like intellect and IQ and genius are static and that they are not good enough or that it is too late for them to be any of these things, and instead position reading as an adventure anyone can have at any age.\n\nAfter all, most of us aren’t aiming for the crown of know-it-all-ism. Most of us just want to live a good and full life. When I die, I’m not hoping that I’ll know the most I could possibly put into my brain. I don’t think that’s the point. And if it is, sorry, I missed it.\n\nThe point of reading, its true magic, is expansion. Reading opens doors, windows, portals. It’s exactly as Einstein famously said:\n\n> “Imagination is more important than knowledge\".\n\nExpansion acts in mysterious ways. It can be cumulative, or it can hit you hard like a eureka moment.\n\nWould I ever admit that, alone in my mid-twenties, reading Cheryl Strayed was what sparked the idea that it was okay to leave? Well, I just did. That, too, was a kind of imagination not related to fairies and spells or space travel held in the container of fantasy or science fiction, but it’s the kind of imagination so many of us need. I’m not picky: imagination, perspective, and expansion can manifest in any way and form. Fiction or nonfiction, long form or short form, literary or genre. Cereal boxes and newspapers were childhood fodder, something for a curious mind to latch onto, to find a hook in the marketing lingo of rice crispies vs fruit loops. I read ads at the bus stop, looked at signage in store windows.\n\nWe’re here at an all-time high of “content” and there is more to read than ever. As reading has become more accessible, so, too, obviously has writing. Technology has enabled us to pay writers directly by collecting their work instead of paying them with clicks and shares and goodwill, though those things, entrenched in the web 2 layer we’ll never escape from, are still appreciated. Good writing comes in so many forms and now it can expand to so many more forms. The end of a book or an article can be the conclusion of an idea but the seed of another somewhere else, the way ideas have always travelled. Just now, it’s so much faster, cheaper, more convenient. We should celebrate *that*, not waste all the time we’ve saved trying to become more like robots.\n\nThere are no answers to what good writing is because good writing depends on the reader. That’s what I discovered when I read 100 books a year and now as I continue to read 100 books a year. I’ve quit books that were bestsellers. But I tried genres and authors and topics that were brand new to me, and in the process, experienced the kind of tingles and longings we all ache for: to be stricken wholly, fully, entirely by wonder.\n\nIn the first issue of Science Wonder Stories published in June 1929, editor Hugo Gernsback writes in his editor’s letter:\n\n> Taste in reading matter changes with each generation. What was acceptable to your grandparents was hopelessly out of style for your parents.\n\nTaste, as it turns out, is a sign of the times and not of absolute truth. And so when we try our best to answer this question, we have to look at the times we are in. Like the famous line from Charles Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities, it is right now both the worst of times but also the best of times. Progress makes it so that at any point in time, this is almost always guaranteed to be the case. But what makes *this* particular point in time special is access to all information and all the new ways to consume it. The biggest choice now that you have all the choice is perhaps just to choose for yourself what you will feed your mind, your heart, and your soul, what it hungers for regardless of how we have decided to shape our world around a self-invented, never-satiated hunger for ease, speed, convenience.\n\nSo go forth and read, whether you are a writer or not, but especially if you are. Without readers, there are no writers. Writers need readers and writers need to be readers. If writing is how so much of the world is built, then the infinite adventure that is reading is what we will use to build it.\n\nIf you’ve read this far and this long, I have some good news for you. You discovered something about yourself just by reading. Why did you keep reading even though I promised you nothing except that I’d rob 32 minutes of your life? Take whatever you learned and go find more of it. See what it’s like to lose yourself in a book, then feel the wonder it is to find yourself again.\n\nAnd to end, you’re rewarded with a TL;DR:\n\n* Read widely: expand who you read from, what you read about, how you read, where you read from.\n* Quit whenever: there’s too little time, too much to read. If you don’t like it, drop it and find something else. There’s much more out there.\n* Have fun!\n\n## Appendix\n\n### How do I find books to read?\n\nOkay, so once you’ve cut down just a bit of your social media usage, the next question is: well, what do you read? Here are some of my suggestions:\n\n1. Google \"\\[someone I admire in any field\\]” and “favorite books”. I’ve also used this to read books loved by well-known public figures like [Marilyn Monroe](https://www.openculture.com/2014/10/the-430-books-in-marilyn-monroes-library.html) and [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books). Along the same lines, anytime you hear someone you admire talk about a book, note it.\n2. Lists of books at your library, bestseller lists, GoodReads, BookTube. Google “top books of 20xx” and see what comes up.\n3. Ask people what their favorite books are. Bonus: you can learn a lot about people by learning what their favorite books are. It’s them admitting *this is what my mind is made of*.\n4. For non-fiction, bibliographies contain original sources so if you liked the book you just read, you might like these too.\n5. Walk into bookstores and go ahead, judge books by their covers.\n\n### How do I read more widely?\n\nRay Bradbury has a very simple “program” for writers. At night, read three things: a poem, a short story, and a nonfiction essay. You can find any of these anywhere, in books or online. Use Google in a playful way and see what comes up when you search for \\[obscure topic you’re interested in\\] + “short stories” or “poems”.\n\nOnce you start reading more widely, it becomes easier. That initial hump is the hardest to get over, because it’s you disrupting your own patterns. Then, you kind of need to reset yourself on purpose once in a while after that, because it’s also easy to slip into the rabbit holes we like once we get into them.\n\n### Buying books is expensive!\n\nDo you have a local library? I hadn’t gone to the library for years as an adult, but when I calculated the cost of reading 100 books, I decided that I needed to go to the library to make it work. I still buy a few books a year, especially from indie authors, but most books I read are from the library and I go about once every ten days. I just recently discovered that my city’s library has a program where they’ll suggest books for you based on a short survey, for free.\n\nJust a note: borrowing books from the library does help authors. When there’s demand in holds and loans, the library orders more copies to meet that demand and most books purchased by libraries are licensed for a certain number of “uses” before the book needs to be repurchased. What this means: if you borrow books from the library you get to read the book for free and it helps the author’s sales, which helps to support authors.\n\nThere are also other ways to read for free: public domain books are free, which you can find in places like the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/) and the [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/).\n\n### Why should I read if I can watch a movie?\n\nMany books and television shows are adapted from books and short stories. Three of my favorite movies are adapted from books: Arrival is adapted from Ted Chiang’s short story, Stories of Your Life; Stardust is adapted from Neil Gaiman’s novel; and Legally Blonde is adapted from an ebook by Amanda Brown.\n\nBut making a film or show requires a lot of work from a lot of different people, and a *lot* of money. Books do, too, but a lot less than movies. Seeking out books to read gives you a lot more choice to dive into the imaginations and ideas of more people, many of whom will never have their stories be made into other media. That being said, I love movies and TV. I also watch a lot of those too and if I weren’t a) a writer and b) extremely introverted, I’d love to be a director. I’m not particularly selective or snobby about what I consume. So yeah, go ahead and watch movies. Just read books, too.\n\n### No, really. How do I read more books?\n\nIf you got this far then I guess you really want to know and “spend less time on social media” isn’t enough. Here are my tactical tips for reading more. Grab a book instead of your phone. Make a list of things, however random, you’ve always wanted to learn about and let your curiosity lead the way. Put books in the places you frequent: on your couch, in the washroom, on your nightstand, even at your computer desk if you’re the type to mindlessly reach over to your phone while working anytime you need a mental break. Make it harder to reach your phone. Then, go deeper. If you’re reading ebooks, put them on the homescreen of your phone and remove social media apps from same said homescreen. Basically, design the user experience of your life to make reading easier and more convenient.\n\n### Okay, I’m reading. How do I write better?\n\nRead, write, share, repeat. Here are some resources and tips:\n\n* [This class](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/good-with-words) from the University of Michigan, which you can take for free by auditing the course, but it’s so valuable that it’s definitely worth the cost if you can afford it. Especially recommended for anyone who wants to start with a good general writing foundation before getting into more creative forms of writing.\n* These books: On Writing by Stephen King, Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke, and Zen in the Art of Writing by Ray Bradbury.\n* [Zadie Smith’s Rules for Writers](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/22/zadie-smith-rules-for-writers)\n* Writer’s workshops. I like the breadth at [Catapult](https://catapult.co/) but there are great workshops probably from everywhere. I also took a [Fairy Tale Writing](https://www.atlasobscura.com/experiences/fairy-tales-online-course) class from Atlas Obscura so don’t count out classes from non-traditional places. There are also many free workshops available on YouTube if you want to participate without feedback.\n* Keep a record of great lines and great copy, kind of like how you’d make a mood board on Pinterest. As Austin Kleon best put it: Steal like an artist.\n* Find mentors. If you want to be a better copywriter, go work at a larger company. You’ll get the rigorous feedback you need to grow as a writer, which you won’t get working at a smaller startup as its only writer.\n* Write about topics you care about and put them out on the internet, like I’m doing now and have been doing for almost two decades. Bonus: you may build a career for yourself this way, also like I have.\n* Use writing challenges to push yourself.

{"id": "ihQheJ8aRScr9qT331osbaOo5OGDFfNr3QT8ng33UvU", "title": "Robots writing for sixth graders", "body": "Hello, are you reading this?\n\nYou are, aren’t you?\n\nIt’s because my sentences are short and you want to scan.\n\nAnd you can.\n\nWhen I write like this.\n\nIt’s like a waterfall, if you’d like to be poetic about it. Your eyes flow, carried down the page so that you may read even as you itch to scroll.\n\nThis is how you read now. You, stranger on the internet, aren’t reading like we were taught to, each word aloud, one by one. You scan, like a robot does, robots invented by us to embody the highest form of efficiency.\n\nAnd they’re here, no longer the stuff of science fiction, in stories that seem to say “be careful what we wish for”. Now, instead of a genie granting wishes, it’s our own ingenuity parlayed through a different kind of magic, science and technology, that we’re warning against.\n\nWe always need a villain. Robots, our desire to be efficient manifested in metal and gears, are it. In these stories—I, Robot, Terminator, WestWorld—we pit robots against humans, beings once objects of servitude turned rebels against our will. But it was our will that designed robots to be efficient, and it was us who changed our habits to match our imagined ideals.\n\nIn that imagination we scan text for meaning because it’s efficient and fast and we can instantly turn complexity into insight, a soundbite, a tangible whiff of wisdom—Except! this is not contained within our imagination. It’s real, and you’re doing it right now. Count me lucky if you’re reading this sentence, tucked so far at the end of a long and winding paragraph that you may miss *this*: yes, a pig just flew by.\n\nI may have lost you already. You’re too well trained. Your habits are so ingrained that they may as well be algorithmic, signalling to you that if it’s not useful or wildly exciting it’s time to move on before you’ve even registered what you’re seeing. That ten second pause to get to the point? Even that’s too much. Swipe. And by now, even the wildly exciting has started to lose its appeal after years of clickbait ruined it all, kind of. Kind of because sometimes we know but we can’t help it anyway: need. to. click. Can’t turn away. But of course, they’re/we’re always one step ahead, UX designers disguising addictive mechanisms as user delight when in fact they’re designing our slow and steady descent into modern madness. Don’t blame them/us: we’re all just trying to make it.\n\nYou don’t even read in order anymore. Without blinking, your eyes jump around. This is nonlinear called reading. See also: scanning.\n\nThe great thing about being a robot is that you get to save time so that perhaps, ultimately, you can spend more of it. But unlike money, which is infinite, time, at least yours, will come to an end sooner than a flash in the pan of the universe. (All the more reason to act like a robot.) Productivity, the beacon of human achievement spanning all geographies, vocations, classes, is at an all-time high because you’ve adapted the likenesses of the robot. Proof? You’re so good at scanning you’ve stopped blinking. This is what my optometrist has told me, and why I now buy and use eyedrops like drugs. If time goes by in the blink of an eye, we’re designed not to let it pass even if our biology hasn’t yet kept up. No matter. Science and eyedrops are here!\n\nThe not-so-great part about being a robot is that it’s hard to turn off. Everything is quantified, measured, decided no longer with the heart nor the mind but with a displaced third party entity known as data.\n\nI can’t tell you when it started but recently I’ve been finding myself glazing over most things I intend to read, scanning instead for the TL;DR, the morsel of insight that will, if not in truth then in intent, mark a piece as read. Messages and everything on read, that’s the default. No action needed, just mark it done. These articles reinforce a feedback loop that show me I don’t need to read everything because most of it is SEO’d junk. I’m not missing out, even though the fear of it makes me do strange things like desire things I don’t even want, click things I don’t even care about. But it’s fine as long as I’m saving time. In fact, I’ve gained so much time I’ve read the entire internet and have now moved onto TikTok where I shall be entertained by jingles and dances served to me by a new and improved algorithm, anything to get away from the onslaught of bots masquerading as people on Instagram and into a land powered by bots who don’t even need to masquerade as people because why would they when here we are, turning ourselves into memes and giving them, giving *us,* exactly what we want. It’s a bot eat bot world.\n\nStop.\n\nYou’re getting ahead of me already. You’ve probably already scanned for how long it’ll take you to read this entire thing and what you’ll gain from it. To save you the trouble: if you’re the average person, it’ll take you about 32 minutes to get to the end. As far as what you’ll learn, nothing maybe. But my hope is that instead of learning something that you can mark as done, something that may be true for six months and then not, you’ll spark an inkling of adventure and possibility, and this inkling will lead to many great things for you to come. So quit and go back to whatever you were looking at or venture forward. You were warned that this isn’t a step-by-step how-to guide on how to write better, how to read more, or how to discover the secret to happiness. I prefer not to make false promises, though perhaps I will lead a trail of breadcrumbs for you to go find out those things for yourself. So decide right now: is this worth 32 minutes of your life, just over two percent of your entire day, this day and this moment which you will never get back?\n\nIf you haven’t yet closed this tab whether by intent or curiosity or pure laziness, allow me to introduce myself. I’ve been writing on the internet since dial-up or “web 1” as the folks on this side of the internet like to call it. What is this side? If you have to ask, then somehow you’ve found yourself here in the land of blockchain and NFTs. It doesn’t matter how you got here but that’s where you are, if you didn’t know.\n\nA brief history of me as a writer: Let’s skip the beginning because back then I wasn’t really writing. Let’s call it journalling. I guess I was okay at it. Journalling online was how I caught the attention of my high school boyfriend. He must’ve enjoyed my account of angsty teenage moments set to Usher lyrics. (This same boyfriend slid into my DMs a couple years ago to tell me some things: lingering resentments and dreams of marriage, and in between, that there’s something special about my writing. He is not linguistically inclined so I took it as an extra special compliment.)\n\nAs the years went by, who we listened to in the world changed from mass media to social media. It’s a hilarious twist of events when you consider, if you were old enough to be there like I was, that once upon a time mass media was belittling, denouncing, and trying to assert its dominance against “people who aren’t trained”, “don’t know what they’re talking about”, “people who have no business being here”—and now on the rare occasion in the passing peripherals of my life, where I happen to see the news on tv, all I see is mass media reporting on things happening on, recorded via, or conversing on social media.\n\nI found myself writing in “web 2”, a.k.a. blogging and web copywriting. Of course, back then no one knew it was web 2 (that’s just something we made up after), but now that we have the gift of hindsight, we can make up ways to categorize the webs, and so we have. No one talks about language when we examine the changes, but language, reading, storytelling, even the concept of “taste” shifted dramatically in web 2. Change needed to happen to make room for the grand echo chamber of the social web where all are welcome to speak, write, make-believe, not just a looping select few. We were (re-)inventing the rules as we went along, so in this new web, all of us were pulled to write shorter and shorter sentences and in easier and easier language because “that’s how people read”.\n\nWe saw the rise of the influencer—single people (singular, not un-coupled) with more power and sway than entire strategically-designed, well-funded, well-storied organizations—and by its maturation, the influencer was passé and we all became content creators, every last one of us except those who do not exist. Keyword stuffing was in and then it, too, was passé though arguably still useful and not arguably quite lucrative. By the end, we were figured out and algorithms got so smart they no longer needed a formula other than “write for people”. And write for people became “write for a sixth grader”. It worked. It’s like Hemingway on steroids, if Hemingway lived on the internet instead of Cuba and drank marketing Koolaid instead of Mojitos.\n\nSince then, I’ve made my living over the past decade writing, though not always as a “writer”. Maybe you can tell. I grew up in web 1 and 2, where I’ve developed the predisposition to put things out on the internet as if I own the place—and well, now I know well that I didn’t. When I was building companies and looking for help with no money and no connections, still I found a treasure trove (or was it a minefield?) of knowledge: “how to write”, “how to convert”, “how to drive sales” articles, and then books. I ate them up like breakfast, pages and pages of them. I followed the advice and became known for making it rain, as my bosses once said. Anytime they needed an injection of capital to fund the next season of cloud and hedgehog onesies, it was *hi Ana, let’s go*. (Disclaimer: they were much nicer than dramatic effect will allow.) I worked my way up to driving $43 million in revenue in three months with my words, headhunted by a recruiter to write for one of the world’s “most innovative companies”, a title they actually hold and not just my humble opinion. It’s a long way from trying to sell one dress a week, what I calculated when I was 21 it would take to sustain myself and my creative dreams.\n\nNow, as a debatably “real writer”, real in the sense that this is what people pay me to do, I can’t shake my “must sell things” roots, which turns out is great for the kind of writing that I do which aims to sell things. But even in that fairly narrow context amidst all the possible kinds of writing that exist, I’ve written from an editorial perspective as well as from a copywriting perspective and even then, the style, approach, methodology differs wildly. Sure, you think about many of the same things: tone, voice, social proof, the art of the headline. But they’re not the same. Good copywriters do not make good journalists do not make good fiction writers do not make good essayists do not make good editors do not make good content writers—usually. That makes sense given how vastly different each is as a discipline, the only real commonality that words are used and things are communicated.\n\nWhen I work with “real” writers turned copywriters, they sometimes physically cringe at the formulas and standards that data has shown us works, the data that took years for me to learn and test, affirming that yes, indeed, if you can get past the spam filters, “free” nearly always performs better than anything else. People really like free stuff.\n\nI know a lot about the words that work because it mattered to me that they did when I was selling things and not just trying to say pretty things. I did whatever I could to make it and luckily fell into the palms of the tech startup world, employee number 1343 of a unicorn that taught me what it meant to 10x everything. There, I learned what it meant to be data-informed and not data-driven, the latter being the calling card of many a startup who’ve lost their hearts and minds and given it up to data. I learned to write not as a copywriter would but as a world-class, award-winning customer support team does. I then went on to coach my team on how to write like people talk, as fast as you can, as accurately as you can, as kind as is humanly possible under the pressure cooker of PR storms and the fury and nonsense of social media.\n\nWhen I was in tech support and how I was writing things mattered to explain concepts from marketing tactics to how to add a code snippet, was that called “good writing”? Was it better writing if I reduced the number of exchanges because they understood what I saying and that meant I was saving the company money? How do you measure good writing when writing is used in so many ways now that the internet has made us all more connected and more measurable?\n\nTaste, when it comes to good writing, just like taste with all things, is truly subjective. But the way that the world is set up with money and power at the helm make it seem as if taste is a very real thing with a hierarchy. The only hierarchy is the hierarchy of broken systems, many of which have already fallen or are on their way, paving the path for taste of a very different kind run by numbers: views, followers, and money (still). Taste today looks like ugly-ass goblins (I think the goblins would take that as a compliment) and million dollar apes and not even real ones, just pictures of apes. Kim Kardashian may not have been “deeply tasteful” back in 2014, but she is the ultimate tastemaker of today, to the tune of millions of followers and billions of dollars. Taste is not only subjective; it requires consensus between people. You have no taste until other people say so, or now, until the numbers prove it.\n\nI actively try train my taste to encompass a spectrum of sensibilities from the “deeply tasteful” (straight from Anna Wintour) to “low-brow” things that can only be considered taste because I like what at least a few other people like. I picked this up in fashion, my actual training ground: for maximum appeal combine high and low, embrace change, make an impact, and above all, “make it work” from the gospel of 2000s era Tim Gunn. You do what you have to to get the job done.\n\nIn writing, that includes but is not limited to psychological trickery, the clever use of numbers, and perfecting the art of the headline to drive clicks, even if it’s a stretch, even if it’s not the truth at all, even if it’s formulaic and boring to a writer’s eyes. There are a lot of false truths out there, ideas with the right facts but the wrong frame, words that sound human but are written by bots, wondrous art made by AI. It’s hard to separate fact from fiction, the lines of the uni/meta/multi-verse are blurring, words that meant one thing five years ago now mean something else.\n\nI do know one thing, this thing I’ve known since I was very little: I want to write good things, things that affect people. But I’ve been hearing a lot about how people don’t read anymore. I’ve been hearing and seeing it for myself, becoming it myself: we are all turning into robots, desperate to be done, desperate to do more, desperate to absorb it all as quickly as possible. The irony is that in the midst of this numbing desperation, we are most desperate of all to feel.\n\nSometimes we fall into things we don’t quite expect. Copywriting made sense for me: all those business books I ate for breakfast led me somewhere and I meandered my way in and out and back into writing as my job. And even if it wasn’t what I expected, it makes sense. I’ve always loved to write. Not that I particularly love the act of writing. There is sometimes nothing tougher than facing a blank page. Even tougher, editing something that is nearly done but not quite. But, I’ve always felt strongest when writing, stronger after having written. We don’t usually talk about women as having power, but I to me, that’s what it feels like: a kind of power that can be held in solitude even with no readers.\n\nOne of my earliest memories of the power that I held was being pulled to the office because Ms. Robertson, my seventh grade teacher, loved a story I had written so much she passed it around to everyone with a beaming smile: the principal, secretaries, anyone who was passing through. The only other time I was pulled to the office was when my youngest sister got into a fistfight with a boy.\n\nThe memory is vague (the story involved a mammoth and that’s about all I can remember) but the signal strong: this, good writing, is more powerful than acing a test or even getting straight As.\n\nSo here I am, a writer and a real one now. And the more time I spend as a writer, I’ve also started to wonder, what else do I want to write?\n\nPart of this was the pandemic, a wake-up call in between the groundhog day-like year we spent in our homes in front of our screens. Part of it is curiosity. Formally, I’ve never been taught to write well other than mandatory K-12 grade education and one community college class to make the basic English graduation requirement for fashion school. But here I was, a good writer by standards not of academics but of a) my clients who are smart people (subjectively in my opinion and objectively), who surely would’ve seen through my foil had I been mediocre after all and b) random strangers on the internet who send me hearts over Instagram because they feel something and I know now the toughest thing of all is to stop someone enough to make them feel, or make them feel enough to stop.\n\nI started to write things other than websites and ads. It started last year. I wrote 50 micro-”stories” about colours, then posted them on Instagram. I wrote essays about things that influenced me as a creative, from Elle Woods to advice columns. This year, I went even further. I wrote a few short stories. I submitted a story to an anthology. I entered a writing contest and placed as a finalist in the first round (next round results pending). And now, I’m writing poetry and am about to release my first book. Now, as my days blur between writing about software and storytelling, my reliance on an online thesaurus at breakneck pace (I use them just as much as a software engineer uses google, I’m sure), I wonder even more about “good writing”.\n\nI, the writer, whether real or an imposter, wonder who’s right about good writing: the internet breed who write in broken up paragraphs, or the pedigreed who abhor the lack of proper paragraph structure? What am I willing to give up to be one or the other? I, believer in shaping your own destiny and choosing your own adventure, wonder which adventure I should embark on.\n\nI wonder: what kind of writer will I be?\n\nWell, I used to. In the weeks that it took me, on and off, to write this meandering strange piece of writing somewhere between essay, diary entry, blog post, and guide, I’ve gone from wondering to decided. In my last and hopefully final edit, I’ve made a revision to say this:\n\nI decided to choose a brand new path, one that evolved out of everything I’ve discovered to be true and things I’ve yet to discover. It’s hard to decide not to choose when we are so used to seeing things in binary, in pitting thing against thing, as if everything else is a lie when in fact everything is a small piece of the truth pointing toward a larger one: we are all just trying to make it.\n\nI’ve moved on from trying to define myself as real or fake, good or bad, marketer or poet, from caring about what taste is to not caring at all, and instead seek to decide for myself what I will bring to people through the raw and magical material that we call words on a screen.\n\nThe end. / The beginning.\n\n\\#\n\nThere once were two places in the world that, for me, were absolute magic: the mall, where I could see all the costumes and objects I could wear and buy to tell the world this is who I want to be for today, and the library, where I could learn anything I could want to and slip into another world for even a moment. I used to wander down the book aisles content to get lost, and once one library had been conquered, we moved on to others in neighbouring municipalities. My family used to spend afternoons, evenings, weekends at libraries (and apparently missed out on learning how to ride bikes). First, it was all of us, and then as we grew older and more independent, it was just me and my dad.\n\nThe only vacation we ever took as a family was a road trip down the Pacific highways to Disneyland in 1997. I didn’t really travel again until I was in my 20s, which was my first time on an airplane. I’ve since increased my travel interval slowly yet steadily from once every twenty years to once every five years to now where I’m lucky enough to be able to travel a few times a year. And each time I do, I’m reminded of the exact same feeling as when I was at the library all those years ago, wandering the aisles getting lost and immersing myself in new worlds. They don’t feel all that separate to me; among my favorite things to do in any new city is to visit bookstores. It’s one of the very first things I put on my itinerary, to explore new worlds within new worlds like a Russian Matryoshka doll.\n\n> There’s something about being in a bookstore that makes you feel infinite. —Source: [Max Joseph, YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIW5jBrrsS0)\n\nInstead of going some*where*, you’re going inside someone’s *mind*, letting them take you to places they feel are worth taking you to, enough to spend time and all the other things that go into writing a book: labour, doubt, grit, research, imagination, love. When it comes to you, you’re right there at the beginning of your journey into the world they have made for you. And when you get to the last page and step away, the book has ended but the possibilities may have only just started to awaken in your imagination.\n\nI discovered things through the creation of safe, solitary spaces that reading affords, and in those spaces I never felt awkward (correction: mostly not awkward; I hesitated buying 50 Shades of Grey in person, opting instead to buy the ebook). With books, I never felt out of place for wanting to know something new or to immerse myself in something different.\n\nAll technologies today are prone to planned obsolescence whether designed or accidental. Books were never meant to be designed this way. They tend to be things we treasure forever, their utility never diminishing as the world around us changes, their worth parallel to how we view collectibles: priceless and tied intimately to our identities. In fact, some get lucky and find that books increase in value with age, if not in monetary value then perhaps in other ways as static devices of imagination and memory. I was never worried that books would become obsolete. If you thought the endless stream of content was going to make them so, I’m not sure about that: I’ve found that internet has now become my trusty companion, leading to most of my favorite books and extending my favorite book experiences in the form of google searches often leading me to rabbit-holes much more interesting than those my algorithm has decided to feed me.\n\nSo, I haven’t stopped reading, though the forms and ways in which I read have become much more diverse—which works out really well for me as a writer. I feel much better equipped to do what I do today with the internet by my side.\n\nActually, most of what I do now as a writer is read. I can usually scrounge up some words pulled from my brain to put on a page, but to finish something, to make it make sense, to make it meaningful, useful, memorable, I need to read it over and over again. Read one sentence, then rewrite it. Read the next, rewrite it. Read the paragraph, then the next. Then go back and do it over and over again. You’d think I was carving David but I’m just writing on the superfluous internet, my words both permanent and fleeting, a blip hard to erase but so easily forgotten.\n\nSometimes I write things and then read them, astounded by my own lack of coherence: *wait until they find out what my writing is really like*, before I read it over and over and over again. The better something reads to you, the more likely it is that I’ve spent more time reading it and rewriting it rather than being a reflection of anything else, like how good or bad a writer I am.\n\nOther times, I am struck to see on screen a thought crystallized into pure magic. Then, disheartened to see one piece of magic in a piece that is so far still incoherent, like this piece right now as I’m writing this sentence. If you’re reading this, congratulations to me; I read it enough to publish. And that’s what writing’s like, a big giant mess until it’s not. Shoutout to editors, who take messes and turn them into magic, for taking ideas sometime stirring for so long they should be rotting in my brain\\*, but instead they get polished enough to sparkle so that sometimes I can pretend that I know things, when in fact, I am writing often to discover things. (On my wish list: a personal editor.)\n\n\\*Let’s talk about brain rot a bit more. The consistent fear of rotting brains echos our consistent fascination with zombies throughout history and across cultures—and we’ve long feared the concept of brain rot well before the internet, before television, before radio. The printing press was invented around 1440 and as its popularity grew, a man named Conrad Gessner proclaimed the new abundance of books “confusing and harmful” to the mind, calling out for regulation to prevent information overload in an era when hardly anyone even had access to education. Socrates the great philosopher refused to write because he believed that writing was harmful to memory. The printing press inspired great paranoia from the Catholic Church since scientists had a means to publish their ideas and research for the first time, ironic given that the first major book printed by the Gutenberg press was the bible. Of course, books also inspired fear and criticism among mostly men who believed that novels corrupted women so much that they could not distinguish between fiction and real life—and look at us now, purposefully creating worlds that are fictional to mirror real life. The easiest way to control a population in the 20th century wasn’t to enslave them, but to censor books, burn them even, as the Nazis did in 1933, as the Chinese Communist Party did in the 1950s, and as a future America did in 2049 in Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451.\n\nIn the grand scheme of human invention, books have become omnipresent, surpassing most technologies in lifespan. The criticisms once reserved for books are now directed towards the internet, and now, the metaverse. Unlike the internet and the metaverse, books have a beginning, a middle, and an end—an adventure like a life: finite.\n\nBut what are books, *really*? They’re just words bound into pages, each varying in length but measured by its ability to encapsulate in a singular unit an idea, a concept, a story. Without these units, words are blobs just like we would be, floating through time without concepts like hours, days, years to guide us. Without these units, these words could be anything.\n\nLast year, I decided that I would read 100 books. 100 contained blobs. 100 chances to learn 100 contained things, to have 100 contained, solitary experiences in solidarity.\n\nWhy? Well, I wanted to. Also, maybe I needed to. What can you during a pandemic anyway? By this point we were about seven months in and I’d binge-watched, video-gamed, VR-ed my way through. It helped a bit and then it didn’t, and when everyone was losing their jobs, I was so burned out that I quit mine. The initial apocalyptic shock eventually wore off and we became a collective socially distanced ball of stir-crazy. If we couldn’t travel to other continents or cities, and even travelling to the grocery store was a whole big thing that required suiting up, masks, and strategy, where else could I go?\n\nI followed suit of middle-class women in the 1800s who were among the first large cohort in history to read for leisure, and decided to read more. It didn’t come of nowhere. I had travelled many times through books all those times I had gone to the library as a kid, then stopped travelling when I started reading books for utility as an adult, my Kindle history a mashup between startup bro and Oprah superfan. My mind was filled with business advice and self-help and these were the books I always reached for even though I had a list of topics I wanted to learn about, some that had been on the list for years that I “never had time for”. I wrote down “economics” because I still didn’t understand what it was, what even the concept of it meant. (Strangely, none of the business or finance books I read ever talked about economics—the closest I got was Freakonomics.)\n\nI finally saw that, barring my elderly years should I be lucky enough to reach that milestone, this right now may be the most time I will ever have.\n\nSo I read. And what a world that opened up for me.\n\n### A brief interlude on how to read 100 books a year\n\n*Basically, spend less time on social media. I’m not an extremist and I don’t believing in going cold turkey if you don’t want to and especially if social media brings some form of joy and connection to your life, which it does for most people, myself included.*\n\n*When I took part in my first ever writer’s workshop this year, a fellow workshopper mentioned that she loved my use of numbers in the fairy tale I was writing. Why, thank you, but that’s just because I’ve had it hounded into me: stats, facts, analytics! (Years working in tech, all those business books coming back to haunt me.) Anyway, here are some stats, facts, analytics! The average person spends about two hours a day on social media (actually 142 minutes, which is two hours and 22 minutes, but let’s round down because almost everyone thinks they’re better than the norm so let’s assume you are and the person next to you is worse). That doesn’t seem like much, maybe, especially if you justify it by saying you’re usually doing something else at the same time. But two hours a day (and remember, we’re rounding down) is one entire month in your year. If you didn’t sleep. If you were on social media 24/7. So put another way (the same way, but in a different order): in your entire year, one entire month is spent on social media.*\n\n*We’ve invented all sorts of ways to act as if we have no time, even though technically we should have more time than ever given how many of our inventions were designed to help us move faster. (Most of them.) See: the transformation of transportation, microwaves, the food supply chain, email and chat, basically everything. We’re obsessed with saving time and being productive. Call us a maximizing species or Parkinson’s Law addicts, but we’re naturals at finding ways to expand our tasks to fill up the extra time we’ve created. Social media, you could say, was invented at just the right time, before we had the time to realize we had so much extra of it.*\n\n*It’s a weird loop. We use social media now even to shill the things we’d like to have time for, if we weren’t on social media all the time. So of course, we shill books. Don’t you know? Celebrity book clubs are the new celebrity talk show.*\n\n*No one’s shilling the act of reading itself except smart people in pockets of interviews found in the glittery tinier spaces of the internet, people like Ruth Simmons, the first Black president of an Ivy League school, who said “The busyness does not make our lives meaningful. It is the interior life that makes the greatest difference to us in the end.”*\n\n*Reading is the interior adventure anyone can have, anywhere, a test of will against the busyness of our exterior lives. Social media has disguised itself as part of our interior lives, when it’s really a portal into the exterior and manicured lives of everything else other than our selves, everywhere and all at once.*\n\n*So here’s my recommendation: halve your social media consumption. Whatever it is right now, do 50 percent. You get two extra weeks of your life this year back. Now read a few books.*\n\nThe longest book I’ve read so far was a compilation of interviews throughout HBO’s 30-year history. When I put the book on hold at the library, I didn’t realize it was the size of the bible. The shortest book I read was Margaret Atwood’s first poetry collection: The Circle Game.\n\nI still don’t have a good answer to “What’s your favorite book?” and I probably never will. Of the 159 books I’ve read in the last year and a half, I’ve marked about 40 as favorites. Another lesson I took from the startup world: fail fast. I’m a quitter. I fail to finish about a third of all books I start. I don’t feel bad about it. The faster I quit, the faster I can get on with the next book, because though each book is finite, books themselves, while quantifiable, are infinite. People keep writing books and no one will ever come close to reading all there is to read.\n\nOn book #18 of 2022, now in my second year reading 100 books, I received a somewhat cryptic message from the universe disguised as someone who signed off as “Daddy”. A slip of paper fell out of page 222 of The Age of Missing Information by Bill McKibben, the book I was reading on February 22 at 10:22pm.\n\n*HiFi! This last page of the chapter said a lot to me. A book as a whole, a page as a fractal. You can’t possess reality. You have to live in it.*\n\nOf course, it wasn’t from my dad, who probably doesn’t know what a fractal is. Just a random stranger looking out for me.\n\nThough I can hold a book in my hands and that is, technically speaking, what it means to possess a book, I wondered what it meant to live in it. All those books I had eaten for breakfast were books I possessed, not books that I had experienced. I was scanning them for knowledge, not for pleasure. I already knew what it was like to live in the experience of the book, a feeling we probably all know when a book sucks you in like gravity and all else fades away. For all the obsession we have in the digital age for user experience, we forget what it’s like to build an experience with words, we forget what it really is that pulls us in.\n\nWe look to data to tell us how to write, and in turn, we’ve turned our own worlds into landscapes only robots can survive. We’re too smart for our own good; we adapt and evolve; we feed the world with the likes, clicks, tactics that we try so hard to run away from. But we’re not getting better, more enlightened, more productive even. And wasn’t that the pinnacle of all that was promised when we set out this way?\n\nWhat are we really after: to possess all the knowledge in the world or to experience the world to its fullest? As a now multi-genre, multi-vocational writer, this question sticks with me because of the strange power that I know I have not for everyone in the world but for one person: you reading this right now. It’s the power I know I have because I’ve had this power used on me, the power of good writing.\n\nThere are many ways that we, both experts and imposters and experts with imposter syndrome, have come up with to teach how to write well. Some believe that you either have it or you don’t. Some believe it’s solely about clarity. Some believe it’s about puns and fun and pizazz. All of the above are correct, and just as I’ve suspected, all of the above are also not the entire truth.\n\nI’ve spent practically my entire life writing but nothing taught me more than when I started to read, really read, again.\n\nIt’s like Zadie Smith said in her first two rules of writing:\n\n* When still a child, make sure you read a lot of books. Spend more time doing this than anything else.\n* When an adult, try to read your own work as a stranger would read it, or even better, as an enemy would.\n\nThis isn’t just for writers, but writers especially because writers create what the rest of us read, what the rest of us put into our brains. Ideas, hunches, stories, just like energy, never come from nowhere. They come from a loop that starts with, keeps moving, and ends with something, anything.\n\nWhilst I read, I wrote. My writing was better, not perfect, never perfect, but better. (Another startup lesson: if it’s perfect, you’re too late. I could give this one more read for all the misplaced commas I’m sure still exist, but I won’t.) I learned to recognize where I stop, so that I could learn to emulate the same feeling. I learned what grabs my attention, and even more important, what holds it. I've learned to simplify and expand. I learned through reading that I really love rhythm; static words then start to feel a bit more like music. I learned that I love contrast more than I do balance—sharp versus soft, easy-to-read versus enough complexity that it pulls you forward, out, and in. I love a little bit of fantasy, a hint of surrealism, a little bit of magic, but yes I do love it all to feel real and relevant and like a person, not the thing, robot or whatever, you think you should be. When I read David Sedaris for the first time, years after I had been recommended his writing, I did in fact LOL. What a delight, I thought, and I made a note to self: let’s try this, too, one day. I made an active decision about the kind of writing I wanted to write. I decided to honour this: that just because someone writes it, and then someone else writes it, doesn’t make it *the* truth, just *a* truth. I learned that while many disregard certain things as fluff (mostly men on things associated with women), as if it’s a threat to all that is true and real and serious, I quite enjoy fluff. Well, fluff and facts. I’m convinced actually that we need more fluff to get away from the sterile, over-minimalist, monotony of almost everything else out there. Give me a pile of fluff over “the intersection of design and technology”, over “great user experiences”. If to fluff means to “make or become fuller, softer, lighter”, I want that. I want fullness. I want softness. I want to feel light and free again. These are things I discovered about myself through reading.\n\nReading allows us to see what’s possible so that we may write more truthfully according to what speaks to our souls, not simply what we’ve known because it was in front of us, because someone told us so. (Though, I’ve started to join writer’s workshops for the primary purpose to discover and explore the things that other people love so much they want to put it front of others; this is how I discovered that I can write any way I can imagine, just like Ntozake Shange does with choreopoems.) We all have to find our own truths, and a great place to start is to read lots, read widely, read deeply.\n\nIt’s hard, I know. It took me decades to get here, and I already liked reading to begin with. Most people aren’t reading, not for leisure anyway. We’ll read information that we’re seeking—examples: among top google searches in 2021, we were reading about true crime (Gabby Petito), a Netflix show (Squid Game), how to be more attractive and how to be happy alone (among the top “how to”s we’ve searched for). We read about the things we want to learn more about. But given the choice, many of us now prefer to watch a quick video. I know I do. My 2019 MacBook Pro can’t seem to handle text-based content with all the on-page ads mass media is now serving, but it can handle an endless stream of TikToks just fine.\n\nAnd that’s fine because truth-seeking doesn’t just come from reading books. We associate reading with their end products—books and now articles—but words are building blocks of almost everything that exists. Yes, books, but also movies, TV, podcasts, documentaries. Great scripts become great movies. Comic books are words and pictures. Games have scripts and stories. There is a “book” for everyone, a world to travel to, a form invented just for you. Songs are a particularly palatable and universal form of reading. Some of my favorite lines are written by songwriters. Great ads and many bad ones are designed to associate the products of capitalism with the stories of our lives, and they often succeed because yeah, I’ve done it because Nike told me to. I include trojan horses in my writing—ideas and concepts associated with optimism, hope, joy, wonder, action, to spread the things I believe in like viruses in blog posts about project management and starting companies, in websites for jewelry companies and workout wear. Even the non-linear way that we read now, to the dissent of writers who lament that no one reads anymore, is in fact a door that opens to a nonlinear way of storytelling made possible with new technologies. Why should stories be in order, in one contained form? What if they were expansive, multi-platform? They can be and they are. The most successful IPs in the world paved the path with billion-dollar franchises that expand storytelling beyond one singular form and into many that don’t just move forward but go backwards and into multiverses. And now, in the world of “web 3”, we’ve seen glimmers expanding on the concept of what it means to tell a story and how to tell it in new ways: not just *for* communities but *with* communities. Books, as long as they have existed, are undergoing a bit of a reinvention themselves. We thought ebooks were the next stop, but it’s just one of many possible ways to think of books. Where books needed to be contained blobs with a beginning, middle, and end, and any books longer than that were then made into a series of books, now books can be written in real time, published in real time, written by multiple people in real time, as long as you want them to be, on and on forever if you want.\n\nThe future of “reading” is made up of the things we *can* imagine right now and will imagine in the future, all to make the act of reading more accessible to more people. Free, paid, buy, borrow, watch, listen, look at, follow. The ways to find our own truths, to discover new paths, and to get closer to who we are, are expanding.\n\nHow great is it that I can write this mega-essay on exactly what I want, exactly how I want, and that if I wanted to, I could pull screenshots or quotes that I particularly love to post on social media so that someone who will never read a 30 minute essay may still be moved by a little snippet and that alone may be enough to spark something? How wonderful is it that if you are reading this and *are* the type of person to enjoy a 30 minute essay with no promises, that you can own this piece as a way to tip me the writer while holding a record of it as part of your digital identity and in a way, build your own personal library of things that may be books or essays or art or other things, and that there is no advertising engine to act as intermediary between us?\n\nNo one has to do anything, but we can now do almost anything. If you want to write for scanners, you can—in fact, you can write an entire essay in 10 seconds with a bot. Just tell them your topic and they’ll spit out 1000 words alchemized from all the information they can find.\n\nIf you want to, like me, try to write in a way that bots cannot—meandering, strange, personal, unfocused—you can, too. You can, like I am here, experiment with taking people through a journey where scanning is impossible because there is nothing to scan, where the “utility” is in the details, the story, the act of reading. There are two reasons I’m writing this way. Part of it is practical in nature: bots will take over many kinds of writing on the internet, anything that requires distillation of information. We may still need human editors but that’s not what I came to do. Part of it is that it feeds me: it’s actually so much fun to make up the rules about what and how I should be writing. It’s been so much fun to use everything I know about writing (so far) to write something I think is worth reading, something I know a robot can’t write. In this world we’ve built, I see a chance to be more human.\n\nBut that chance is one that needs to be taken actively because in no way is it the easier route. Scanning is easy, reading isn’t. There’s no psychological trickery involved. Clothes come in seasons, so hi FOMO. No one would dare declare a book a seasonal affair, after all the work that goes into it, sometimes many years. (But could a magazine be a book?) That doesn’t mean we haven’t invented ways to try: glowing reviews on back covers for social proof, book clubs in which we must show up having read the book or be publicly ridiculed, apps like Goodreads in which we can show off our taste and progress, even social media with the rise of BookTok and BookTube, and Hadids carrying books like handbags.\n\nIt’s so hard now for most people to read yet still an indicator of status and intellect that we’ll even fake it: we share articles we’ve never read just to appear as if we have, or we read just the headlines, get the gist, and call it done.\n\nSo we’ve come to this: Are people not reading because what we’re writing isn’t good enough to capture their attention, or are we writing this way because we were told that this is how we should write to get people to read?\n\nWe were taught how to get as many readers as possible (we don’t call them readers, but the detached and gory “eyeballs” ie. we need more eyeballs on this!), how to sell to as many people as possible, how to use just the right word to sell one percent more. These things work, but for a limited time before the singular event becomes an environment, one that grows and grows until we all start to understand the rules and play the game, too. We keep pushing as they pull away, then we push harder until we look up and see a world in which we’ll never catch up because we’ve trained everyone to expect the bare minimum. Welcome to the lowest common denominator world, where “good writing” means robots writing for sixth graders.\n\nNot that there’s anything wrong with robots (or sixth graders, for that matter). They are all the ways we wish to be efficient for all the things we wish to be efficient about: crunching numbers, automating mundane tasks, cleaning floors. But the thing about robots is that they aren’t sentient; they’re taught to do exactly what they’re programmed to do. The thing about you is you’re not a robot, so why are you acting as if you are? Why are you living for efficiency when you could discover so much else? Literally, *literally*, anything else in the world and beyond.\n\nBlame your brain: on the one hand gloriously capable, on the other a squishy sack that can’t even tell black and blue from white and gold. We are easily distracted, easily tricked, easily manipulated. They were probably right about women and novels, except it’s not women and novels after all but people and everything.\n\nAlright, fine. It’s an uphill battle. Everything’s working against us. This is the moment in any superhero movie where the protagonist is in a crunch against the enemy and they’re losing the fight, but you just know that something’s going to come along and save them because there’s always a happy ending and there’s no way the hero’s going to die. Sometimes a side character comes along and provides a much needed distraction to briefly untangle from enemy, but the thing that always has to happen is the hero has to find something in themselves, usually from a memory and always from a feeling, that scrambles the logical rules of the universe so that they can, for a brief moment, turn the tables in a make or break moment.\n\nYou are the main character. I am a passing side character in your life. I just came by and hopefully served as enough of a distraction to stop the enemy’s ascent for a brief moment. Now it’s up to you.\n\nIf you’ve ever read something so beautifully immersive, so fascinating, so captivating that truly, you did read each word, one by one, and sometimes read it back again to experience a moment of magic once again, and even just to make sure that you did not miss anything—if that’s you, then you may already have your thing.\n\nChoosing to read teaches us to be active in our pursuit of wonder, helps us pay attention to what matters, shows us what the opposite of noise feels like. When you read something good, you know because it stops you. Your human instincts take over and the urge to scan is gone. This is what it’s like to read for leisure. We undo our descent into the dystopian imagination and into a fantastical one. I use the word “reading” here loosely; you can just about apply it to anything you consume that requires the act of paying attention. Just remember to choose what you pay attention to. The enemy is both noisy and silent, invisible and everywhere.\n\nThis pursuit needs to be enforced and protected, and it can’t be positioned as a way to become smarter. (Yes, this is me the copywriter trying to give reading a bit of a brand refresh.) When we think of someone who is a reader, especially as children, we make an assumption that maybe they’re smart. Instead, I think someone who likes to read should be assumed to be adventurous. Just think of what could happen if we reposition reading so that it appeals to all the people who believe that things like intellect and IQ and genius are static and that they are not good enough or that it is too late for them to be any of these things, and instead position reading as an adventure anyone can have at any age.\n\nAfter all, most of us aren’t aiming for the crown of know-it-all-ism. Most of us just want to live a good and full life. When I die, I’m not hoping that I’ll know the most I could possibly put into my brain. I don’t think that’s the point. And if it is, sorry, I missed it.\n\nThe point of reading, its true magic, is expansion. Reading opens doors, windows, portals. It’s exactly as Einstein famously said:\n\n> “Imagination is more important than knowledge\".\n\nExpansion acts in mysterious ways. It can be cumulative, or it can hit you hard like a eureka moment.\n\nWould I ever admit that, alone in my mid-twenties, reading Cheryl Strayed was what sparked the idea that it was okay to leave? Well, I just did. That, too, was a kind of imagination not related to fairies and spells or space travel held in the container of fantasy or science fiction, but it’s the kind of imagination so many of us need. I’m not picky: imagination, perspective, and expansion can manifest in any way and form. Fiction or nonfiction, long form or short form, literary or genre. Cereal boxes and newspapers were childhood fodder, something for a curious mind to latch onto, to find a hook in the marketing lingo of rice crispies vs fruit loops. I read ads at the bus stop, looked at signage in store windows.\n\nWe’re here at an all-time high of “content” and there is more to read than ever. As reading has become more accessible, so, too, obviously has writing. Technology has enabled us to pay writers directly by collecting their work instead of paying them with clicks and shares and goodwill, though those things, entrenched in the web 2 layer we’ll never escape from, are still appreciated. Good writing comes in so many forms and now it can expand to so many more forms. The end of a book or an article can be the conclusion of an idea but the seed of another somewhere else, the way ideas have always travelled. Just now, it’s so much faster, cheaper, more convenient. We should celebrate *that*, not waste all the time we’ve saved trying to become more like robots.\n\nThere are no answers to what good writing is because good writing depends on the reader. That’s what I discovered when I read 100 books a year and now as I continue to read 100 books a year. I’ve quit books that were bestsellers. But I tried genres and authors and topics that were brand new to me, and in the process, experienced the kind of tingles and longings we all ache for: to be stricken wholly, fully, entirely by wonder.\n\nIn the first issue of Science Wonder Stories published in June 1929, editor Hugo Gernsback writes in his editor’s letter:\n\n> Taste in reading matter changes with each generation. What was acceptable to your grandparents was hopelessly out of style for your parents.\n\nTaste, as it turns out, is a sign of the times and not of absolute truth. And so when we try our best to answer this question, we have to look at the times we are in. Like the famous line from Charles Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities, it is right now both the worst of times but also the best of times. Progress makes it so that at any point in time, this is almost always guaranteed to be the case. But what makes *this* particular point in time special is access to all information and all the new ways to consume it. The biggest choice now that you have all the choice is perhaps just to choose for yourself what you will feed your mind, your heart, and your soul, what it hungers for regardless of how we have decided to shape our world around a self-invented, never-satiated hunger for ease, speed, convenience.\n\nSo go forth and read, whether you are a writer or not, but especially if you are. Without readers, there are no writers. Writers need readers and writers need to be readers. If writing is how so much of the world is built, then the infinite adventure that is reading is what we will use to build it.\n\nIf you’ve read this far and this long, I have some good news for you. You discovered something about yourself just by reading. Why did you keep reading even though I promised you nothing except that I’d rob 32 minutes of your life? Take whatever you learned and go find more of it. See what it’s like to lose yourself in a book, then feel the wonder it is to find yourself again.\n\nAnd to end, you’re rewarded with a TL;DR:\n\n* Read widely: expand who you read from, what you read about, how you read, where you read from.\n* Quit whenever: there’s too little time, too much to read. If you don’t like it, drop it and find something else. There’s much more out there.\n* Have fun!\n\n## Appendix\n\n### How do I find books to read?\n\nOkay, so once you’ve cut down just a bit of your social media usage, the next question is: well, what do you read? Here are some of my suggestions:\n\n1. Google \"\\[someone I admire in any field\\]” and “favorite books”. I’ve also used this to read books loved by well-known public figures like [Marilyn Monroe](https://www.openculture.com/2014/10/the-430-books-in-marilyn-monroes-library.html) and [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books). Along the same lines, anytime you hear someone you admire talk about a book, note it.\n2. Lists of books at your library, bestseller lists, GoodReads, BookTube. Google “top books of 20xx” and see what comes up.\n3. Ask people what their favorite books are. Bonus: you can learn a lot about people by learning what their favorite books are. It’s them admitting *this is what my mind is made of*.\n4. For non-fiction, bibliographies contain original sources so if you liked the book you just read, you might like these too.\n5. Walk into bookstores and go ahead, judge books by their covers.\n\n### How do I read more widely?\n\nRay Bradbury has a very simple “program” for writers. At night, read three things: a poem, a short story, and a nonfiction essay. You can find any of these anywhere, in books or online. Use Google in a playful way and see what comes up when you search for \\[obscure topic you’re interested in\\] + “short stories” or “poems”.\n\nOnce you start reading more widely, it becomes easier. That initial hump is the hardest to get over, because it’s you disrupting your own patterns. Then, you kind of need to reset yourself on purpose once in a while after that, because it’s also easy to slip into the rabbit holes we like once we get into them.\n\n### Buying books is expensive!\n\nDo you have a local library? I hadn’t gone to the library for years as an adult, but when I calculated the cost of reading 100 books, I decided that I needed to go to the library to make it work. I still buy a few books a year, especially from indie authors, but most books I read are from the library and I go about once every ten days. I just recently discovered that my city’s library has a program where they’ll suggest books for you based on a short survey, for free.\n\nJust a note: borrowing books from the library does help authors. When there’s demand in holds and loans, the library orders more copies to meet that demand and most books purchased by libraries are licensed for a certain number of “uses” before the book needs to be repurchased. What this means: if you borrow books from the library you get to read the book for free and it helps the author’s sales, which helps to support authors.\n\nThere are also other ways to read for free: public domain books are free, which you can find in places like the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/) and the [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/).\n\n### Why should I read if I can watch a movie?\n\nMany books and television shows are adapted from books and short stories. Three of my favorite movies are adapted from books: Arrival is adapted from Ted Chiang’s short story, Stories of Your Life; Stardust is adapted from Neil Gaiman’s novel; and Legally Blonde is adapted from an ebook by Amanda Brown.\n\nBut making a film or show requires a lot of work from a lot of different people, and a *lot* of money. Books do, too, but a lot less than movies. Seeking out books to read gives you a lot more choice to dive into the imaginations and ideas of more people, many of whom will never have their stories be made into other media. That being said, I love movies and TV. I also watch a lot of those too and if I weren’t a) a writer and b) extremely introverted, I’d love to be a director. I’m not particularly selective or snobby about what I consume. So yeah, go ahead and watch movies. Just read books, too.\n\n### No, really. How do I read more books?\n\nIf you got this far then I guess you really want to know and “spend less time on social media” isn’t enough. Here are my tactical tips for reading more. Grab a book instead of your phone. Make a list of things, however random, you’ve always wanted to learn about and let your curiosity lead the way. Put books in the places you frequent: on your couch, in the washroom, on your nightstand, even at your computer desk if you’re the type to mindlessly reach over to your phone while working anytime you need a mental break. Make it harder to reach your phone. Then, go deeper. If you’re reading ebooks, put them on the homescreen of your phone and remove social media apps from same said homescreen. Basically, design the user experience of your life to make reading easier and more convenient.\n\n### Okay, I’m reading. How do I write better?\n\nRead, write, share, repeat. Here are some resources and tips:\n\n* [This class](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/good-with-words) from the University of Michigan, which you can take for free by auditing the course, but it’s so valuable that it’s definitely worth the cost if you can afford it. Especially recommended for anyone who wants to start with a good general writing foundation before getting into more creative forms of writing.\n* These books: On Writing by Stephen King, Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke, and Zen in the Art of Writing by Ray Bradbury.\n* [Zadie Smith’s Rules for Writers](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/22/zadie-smith-rules-for-writers)\n* Writer’s workshops. I like the breadth at [Catapult](https://catapult.co/) but there are great workshops probably from everywhere. I also took a [Fairy Tale Writing](https://www.atlasobscura.com/experiences/fairy-tales-online-course) class from Atlas Obscura so don’t count out classes from non-traditional places. There are also many free workshops available on YouTube if you want to participate without feedback.\n* Keep a record of great lines and great copy, kind of like how you’d make a mood board on Pinterest. As Austin Kleon best put it: Steal like an artist.\n* Find mentors. If you want to be a better copywriter, go work at a larger company. You’ll get the rigorous feedback you need to grow as a writer, which you won’t get working at a smaller startup as its only writer.\n* Write about topics you care about and put them out on the internet, like I’m doing now and have been doing for almost two decades. Bonus: you may build a career for yourself this way, also like I have.\n* Use writing challenges to push yourself. Examples: pick a theme and write poems for 30 days on that theme, participate in [NYC Midnight](https://www.nycmidnight.com/), write a novel during [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/).\n* Whatever you write, spend a lot of time writing titles and headlines. Test these if you can.\n* Keep the pen moving.", "timestamp": 1658442762, "digest": "AKKDAW8SBYn5Pm8Po9sR0PKynW6QSygBqbHnnOt5J1Y", "contributor": "0xf68110A22E2E05568249211fDC3D0cCB31d604A1"}

For normies (non-crypto), it might not be obvious why stablecoin exist today, in term of search the shed of light—let’s dive into it!\n\n## The Holy Grail of Crypto\n\nFiat currencies are prone to fluctuation of exchange rates, [diminishing purchasing power](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/bitcoin-and-inflation-everything-you-need-to-know), and inflation. These fluctuations are exacerbated in the realm of cryptocurrencies, which are subject to massive volatility, making them appealing to speculators yet also impractical for mainstream use. In their most simplistic form, stablecoins are simply cryptocurrencies with stable prices measured in fiat currency.\n\nThe volatility of a cryptocurrency may fuel speculation—prevents [mainstream adoption](https://dune.com/hagaetc/stablecoins) of applications built on top of protocols, but it subsequently (in the near future) hinders real-world adoption; precludes [derivatives](https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/crypto-derivatives-101-a-beginners-guide-on-crypto-futures-crypto-options-and-perpetual-contracts), [blockchain-based loans](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-crypto-lending-and-how-does-it-work), [prediction markets](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/04/forecasting-prediction-markets-and-the-age-of-better-information/#:\\~:text=Prediction%20markets%20are%20marketplaces%20where,%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9CNo%E2%80%9D), and other longer-term smart contracts that require price stability.\n\nPrice volatility may also prevented a currency from retaining its medium of exchange and store of value properties—defining prices for goods and services becomes more difficult as prices fluctuate, deeming the currency unsuitable as a unit of account. Therefore **the adoption of stablecoins will be a catalyst to the new decentralized internet becoming mainstream**.\n\nBut what type of \"stable\" mechanism is required to counteract volatility?, a perfectly engineered stablecoin is the key to achieve the essential properties of a currency. Graphic bellow summarize it.\n\n![\"Stable\" Currency ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FvmcEgHZ_A8XzbuP93H0R.png?height=765&width=1600&&&&&size=medium)\n\nAs cryptocurrencies, stablecoins use blockchain technology to run their smart contracts. Stablecoins are often backed by an external asset class, while others rely on complicated algorithms to maintain their value. By being on chain, these assets gain the underlying protocol's security, speed, and ease of use while retaining a fixed value in the historically volatile cryptocurrency market; provide stable pairings for foundation of [liquidity pools](https://cointelegraph.com/news/altcoin-roundup-stablecoin-pools-could-be-the-next-frontier-for-defi/amp), and are regarded as a core [DeFi infrastructure](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/the-state-of-stablecoins-in-defi?r=djmhe&s=r&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=direct).\n\n> Stablecoins are the fundamental Decentralized Finance (DeFi) money component (specific category of cryptoassets), the essential denomination—basic primitive that use various mechanisms to maintain their value at one unit of account\n\n**Stablecoins typically have low volatility**; serve as the basic building block for simple and much more complex financial products, provide a familiar mechanism to transfer capital and store value that easily bridgeable to traditional finance, and enable investors to exit positions on chain by acting as a safe haven during market volatility, **b…but what is the price for it?**.\n\n## The Price of Stability\n\nA stablecoin proclaims to be an asset that prices itself rather than an asset that is valued by supply and demand; stablecoins are just currency pegs, and currency pegs are far from impossible—[numerous currency pegs are still being maintained](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Finance:List_of_circulating_fixed_exchange_rate_currencies). However, practically all major central banks have abandoned currency pegs. This is due in part to the realization that currency pegs are [rigid (inflexible) and difficult to maintain](https://www.thebalance.com/fixed-exchange-rate-definition-pros-cons-examples-3306257), efficiently, no currency peg can be maintained against [sufficiently adverse conditions](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/currency-crises.asp).\n\nThe reality is, any peg can be maintained, **but only within a particular band range of market behavior**. The band may be broader for certain pegs than others. But it’s straightforwardly true that under certain market conditions, it's possible to maintain a peg.\n\n> To summarize, an ideal stablecoin should be able to withstand significant market volatility, be relatively inexpensive to maintain, should have easy to analyze stability parameters, and should be transparent to traders and arbitrageurs. **These features maximize its real-world stability**.\n\nWhen “stability” comes into play, there is a dimension in which different stablecoin schemes emerge to fill the gaps. There are taxonomy of stablecoins includes three families: fiat-collateralized coins, crypto-collateralized coins, and non-collateralized coins.\n\n![Stablecoin scheme & strategies](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/knBxUO6bxUAETSmABQbkd.png?height=1028&width=1051)\n\n## Fiat-collateralized\n\nStablecoins are the most straightforward way to create a stable currency. A certain amount of fiat currency is deposited as a collateral and coins are issued 1:1 against this fiat money, such as [USDT](https://tether.to/), [USDC](https://www.centre.io/usdc), [BUSD](https://www.binance.com/en/busd). Although this method is simple and robust, it requires a central party (custodian) which guarantees the issuance and redeemability of the stablecoin. Regular audits are needed to ensure that the stablecoin is indeed fully collateralized. Naturally, other pegs backed by interchangeable assets such as gold, silver or oil are also possible; linked to a specific amount of the commodity and stored in a known location—frequently subject to outside audits (collateralized, i.e. [PAX Gold](https://paxos.com/paxgold/), [DGX](https://digix.global/dgx#/))\n\n### Pros:\n\n* 999999999999% price-stable\n* Simplest (a big virtue!!!)\n* Less vulnerable to hacks, since no collateral is held on the blockchain\n* Comodity stablecoins give investors the opportunity to trade tangible assets, along with the ability to accumulate value over time\n\n### Cons:\n\n* It can affected by the health of the asset they’re pegged to. For instance, If the value of the USD is debased, it affects the value of USDT and other off-chain collateralized stablecoins.\n* Centralized — need a trusted custodian to store the fiat (otherwise vulnerable to brick and mortar theft)\n* Regulation always poses a risk with these centralized—need regular audits to ensure transparency\n* Counterparty risk—the value of the stablecoin will spiral downwards if the company's cash reserves don't exist\n* Expensive and slow liquidation into fiat\n\n## Crypto-collateralized\n\nStablecoins work quite similar to their fiat-counterparts, with the exception that the collateral is not an asset in the “real-world” but rather another cryptocurrency. To account for the price-volatility of the underlying crypto-collateral, these stablecoins are often over-collateralized. The most popular crypto-collateralized stablecoin currently is [DAI](https://makerdao.com/en/); minted by users who deposit assets like ETH and USDC as collateral into the Maker protocol. In doing so, users effectively take out a loan in DAI by collateralizing their crypto assets.\n\nHowever, in case of a [black swan event](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackswan.asp), where the underlying asset becomes completely worthless, the stablecoin would collapse too. In this case the loss-exposure would even be amplified for the stablecoin owners because of the over-collateralization. This is also why some experts are [strongly discouraging](https://prestonbyrne.com/2017/12/10/stablecoins-are-doomed-to-fail/) this approach.\n\n### Pros:\n\n* More decentralized (trustless)—there is no [counterparty risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp), resistant to censorship and government regulation\n* Can liquidate quickly and cheaply into underlying crypto collateral (just a blockchain transaction)\n* Very transparent — easy for everyone to inspect the collateralization ratio of the stablecoin\n* Can be used to create leverage\n\n### Cons:\n\n* Can be auto-liquidated during a price crash into underlying collateral\n* Less price stable than fiat, over-collateralized to manage volatility\n* Tied to the health of a particular cryptocurrency (or basket of cryptocurrencies)\n* Inefficient use of capital\n* Most complexity\n\n## Non-collateralized\n\nStablecoins are not actually “backed” by anything other than the expectation that they will retain a certain. One often-mentioned solution to non-collateralized stablecoins is the [seigniorage shares](https://cointelegraph.com/altcoins-for-beginners/a-beginner-s-guide-on-algorithmic-stablecoins) approach. This concept builds on smart contracts that algorithmically expand and contract the supply of the price-stable currency much like a central bank does with fiat currencies, but in a decentralized manner, for reference:   [USTC](https://www.terra.money/), [USDN](https://neutrino.at/), [AMPL](https://www.ampleforth.org/), [FEI](https://fei.money/), [FRAX](https://frax.finance/#welcome).\n\n### Pros:\n\n* No (need to lock up) collateral required—capital efficient\n* Most decentralized and independent (not tied to any other cryptocurrency or to fiat)\n* Just like crypto-collateralized stablecoins—do not have counterparty risk\n* The seigniorage mechanism is defined by audited, open-source, smart contract code that can be viewed by everyone\n\n### Cons:\n\n* Requires continual growth\n* Most vulnerable (high-risk) to crypto decline or crash, and cannot be liquidated in a crash\n* Difficult to analyze safety bounds or health\n* Some complexity\n\n## Utopian Stablecoin\n\nDespite the volatility that the crypto market is known for, the growth of the stablecoin market is unphased by this unpredictability. Market capitalization growth is at an exponential pace despite the extremely low adoption outside of the crypto industry.\n\n![Stablecoin will evolve ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/die1UwGOnJdq_TagPHZjt.png?height=1260&width=2401&&&&&size=medium)\n\nStablecoin are here to stay; represent a large growth sector in digital assets, provides a crucial on-ramp to the crypto ecosystem. **But as In times of high volatility, the chances of breaking the peg increases**—especially for those stablecoins that are not sufficiently backed by assets in their treasury. This is particularly concerning when we realize that high volatility in crypto markets is very common. As a result, there is a sense of doubt that has been cast over the industry.\n\nSome may argue stablecoin critics suspect that stablecoins, particularly crypto-collateralized  stablecoins, [are inevitably doomed to fail](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/macroprudential-bulletin/html/ecb.mpbu202207_2\\~836f682ed7.en.html), because even over-collateralized stablecoins would collapse in the face of a [black swan event](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/black-swan-event). Others doubt that pegging a cryptocurrency to a fiat currency such as the US Dollar is the right fundamental problem to solve in the first place.\n\nWith this argument, **an actual stablecoin should not be stable in relation to a fiat currency, but rather remain stable in its purchasing power**. Only time will tell whether a mainstream stablecoin emerges.\n\n> Smart contracts might help maintain the (constant) value of a stablecoin and make it a viable unit of account.\n\nThe outstanding problem, however, is that smart contracts brings a unique set of risks to the table ranging from treasury management to censorship and no team has been able to develop a universally accepted stablecoin that does not compromise features of either [privacy, security or decentralization](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma).\n\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/17419](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/17419)\n\nAnother concern that smart contracts represent is that the **currency control can be compromised in such a way that causing the treasury could be mismanaged**. This [manipulation](https://finbold.com/terra-labs-had-3-6-billion-in-stablecoins-potentially-used-for-price-manipulation-study-shows/) might involve currency hyperinflation or the removal of treasury funds. In the governance case related to the treasury, **compromise of the stablecoin can be caused through a failure in governance to act in the best interests of the stablecoin**. If the coin contains treasury reserves that are maintained in secrecy and do not have transparent audits, holders may be concerned since this is seen as less transparent than central banking.\n\nCrypto collateralized stablecoins offer transparency into the governance and treasury but if they are using on-chain governance it is feasible to game the governance architecture and essentially take control of the protocol managing the stablecoin treasury.\n\n> On-chain governance has been exploited with devastating effects, drawing attention to the necessity for careful vigilance with all on-chain components of the stablecoin.\n\nIn the centralization risk, **certain stablecoins have the capacity to censor users** the use of them may not be desirable as this is the same effect as having their [assets frozen](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/technology/crypto-industry-prices-fall.html). It reflect with the assumption that people can have custody over the stablecoin isn’t a given with every design. For example, financial institution may utilize a stablecoin to perform transactions on your behalf, but the institution retains custody of the stablecoins.\n\n**Institutions may decide that they do not want custody of public forms of crypto** but instead want to capitalize on the strengths of crypto by using private blockchains and tokenized assets defined by an institution or group of institutions such as banks, whereas the government may choose to [ban certain digital assets](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/01/what-s-behind-china-s-cryptocurrency-ban/) in favor of government-issued tokens there is a risk that **governments may choose technology managed by the state** ([central bank denominated currencies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-15/china-is-showing-off-its-central-bank-digital-yuan-currency-at-beijing-olympics) depending on people jurisdication).\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/57088](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/57088)\n\nThe crypto industry seeks consistent and clear regulation across a wide range of jurisdictions that span not just countries but smaller authorities such as states and provinces, which further complicates compliance.\n\n> **Modernization of regulatory frameworks must embrace the distinct properties of digital assets** while also acknowledging that many of the existing products are designed to be genuinely decentralized and trustworthy on an international scale.\n\nUntil laws are reworked, or new laws are introduced, the crypto industry still faces a degree of uncertainty until more clarity is in place. The crypto industry is more advanced these days, and lobby groups are more common to advocate for the use of digital assets and finance.\n\nA successful implementation of a stablecoin could potentially be a major catalyst for fundamental long-term innovation in the crypto ecosystem. Lack of price stability prevents cryptocurrencies from displacing most forms of fiat money and enabling decentralized applications, stablecoins can provide the solution. A broadly established fiat-free currency that’s price stable will likely challenge the legitimacy of weak government issued currencies around the world—**until then, let’s debunking myth around this industry**.", "timestamp": 1658443074, "digest": "VJ6kujKfMGMObsoB5deEuLsGQUgY86IaIL8Y-kh4V1w", "contributor": "0xb5e04FA0Ef320DbBeeFf49E1c05FA5cE5725757D"}

FTX profits are “running kind of roughly in line with last year,” and the company has gained market share in the last few months. FTX rejected the idea of adding Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) to its treasury, Bankman-Fried also said, but would have considered it in the range of $15,000.\n\nFTX US’s quest to expand its suite of financial products in the United States [has made progress in the last year](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bankman-fried-faces-down-roomful-of-futures-industry-insiders-at-cftc-roundtable), and there are “tens of thousands” of people on the waitlist, Bankman-Fried said.

Beyond the hype, however, these technologies are building immersive worlds that intersect digital and real life. As more people migrate to the metaverse to work, play and “live,” so to speak, real-world complications are bound to arise. \n\nHave you ever thought about how [crime will be policed in the metaverse](https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-life-after-crime-what-happens-to-crypto-seized-in-criminal-investigations)? How will we stop bad actors from ruining the next great leap in human ingenuity? Cointelegraph’s editor-in-chief Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr pondered these questions and more in an exclusive interview with Next Earth’s David Taylor and ActiveFence’s Tomer Poran. The 20-minute talk took place in the oldest bar in Dublin, Ireland.\n\nWhen asked about how we should tackle the problem of bad actors within the context of the metaverse, Poran opined:\n\n> “Don't try to fix fraudsters or Nazis or terrorists. They will remain. They existed before the internet and they'll exist after.”\n\nHowever, that doesn’t mean the problem can’t be addressed. “There is one aspect that we as platform providers can do, which is education,” said Taylor. “And just constant education. It will never be enough.”\n\n***Related: [34% of gamers want to use crypto in the Metaverse, despite the backlash](https://cointelegraph.com/news/34-of-gamers-want-to-use-crypto-in-the-metaverse-despite-the-backlash)***\n\nTaylor and Poran also gave some examples of bad actors inside the metaverse. We don’t want to spoil the interview, but one example was a plot of land in the shape of a swastika being sold. Of course, you also have your usual cases of scammers and fraudsters.\n\nCorner ended the interview by asking when, finally, will [mainstream society be ready for the metaverse](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-first-metaverse-designed-for-non-crypto-gamers-releases-theatrical-trailer-ahead-of-launch). You’re going to want to hear the experts’ thoughtful answers on this one, especially if you are banking on metaverse plays being part of your crypto portfolio moving forward.\n\n**Check out the full interview on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/cointelegraph_com), and don’t forget to subscribe!**", "timestamp": 1658445876, "digest": "bGTPKIcytPEHPomLqAHo_olRxzvMq_-r8JIOJR37MEw", "contributor": "0xF02716289b2036d51283B9baEc327355F27381F9"}

definition of a DAO?\n  * What’s the initial historical reference point?\n  * What’s a World computer?\n  * What’s a VM-DLT asset?\n* What’s a DAO to a legal engineer?\n  * multisignatory shared possession of by-proxy and by-corpus assets\n  * outsource governance to machines with deference or equivalence\n  * What’s code-deference?\n  * permissionless arms-length business reliance using composability\n* What’s a soul-DAO?\n  * DAO as OS\n  * What’s the OS of a World computer VM-DLT?\n  * community DAO and personal soul-DAO\n* references\n\n### What’s the definition of a DAO?\n\nLegislation might officially restrict the definition of DAO to a legal test but originally the word DAO literally meant Decentralized Autonomous Organization.\n\nThe word DAO has quickly become a neologism for an organization that engages with the by-corpus asset class defined below, often as a method of signaling to consumers that the organization engages with Non-Fungible Token “NFT” commerce.\n\nPhenomenologically, these definitions of a DAO seem to be more derived from market pressures than from fundamental insights through careful *a posteriori* deconstruction.\n\n### What’s the initial historical reference point?\n\nThe Internet is continuing to mature its life cycle by solving harder and harder behavioral wealth network effect problems with each generation, and this time the problem is generating and managing consumer grade liquidable assets on the Web.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Web1 figured out how to generate( read ) behavioral wealth network effects.\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, Web2 figured out how to generate( read, write ) behavioral wealth network effects.\n\nAnd in the 2020s as well as perhaps 2030s, Web3 is figuring out how to generate( read, write, own ) behavioral wealth network effects.\n\n### What’s a World computer?\n\nWeb3 infrastructure uses Turing complete Distributed Ledger Technology “DLT” that networks together a public access World computer.\n\nUsing a corpus-classification analogy, each personal computer is like a cell in a human body and a World computer is like the human body.\n\n* Not all DLTs are the same and a public access World computer’s stack relies on multiple types of DLTs that produce a composited functionalities structure.\n\nThe most public DLT layer of a public access World computer is also its floor layer, and is a single Virtual Machine DLT “VM-DLT” computational state shared by all personal computers on the network.\n\nFor the right price, aspects of the “VM-DLT” on a public access World computer can be permissionlessly modified by any personal computer with a variety of cryptographic constraints.\n\n### What’s a VM-DLT asset?\n\nThe more publicly arms-length, numerous and distributed-consensus the plurality of personal computers in the network, the more mechanistically trustworthy the VM-DLT as well as the more free market the VM-DLT.\n\nHowever, the mechanistic trustworthy free market advantage of a VM-DLT is exponentially more costly to run than traditional networks because it requires far more steps to complete the same outcome, and each of those steps must be multiplied by byzantine fault network redundancy.\n\nSo, the most mechanistically trustworthy VM-DLTs are best used when conveying only the legal title and title state change for the high value assets virtualized by a public access World computer, just the basics compared to more complicated privity such as beneficial rights.\n\nLegal title in this context includes traditional legal title concepts as well as tokenomic innovations about the types of objects that have title, for instance the NFT *sui generis* IP discussed below.\n\n* Assets can be high value because they’re **by-proxy** valued in other markets and a VM-DLT is an outsourced mechanically trustworthy accounting wrapper that includes free-market liquidity access.\n\nIf the proxied market is a niche market, VM-DLT provides an opportunity to trade assets from that niche market in an exchange with a much more open ended liquidity potential.\n\n* Assets can be high value because they’re **by-corpus** valued *sui generis* IP assets that only exist within the VM-DLT public access World computer and cannot exist anywhere else.\n\nFor instance, a token that only exists on a VM-DLT must exist on that VM-DLT.\n\n* Assets can be a compilation of **by-proxy** and **by-corpus** assets; the by-proxy or its terms might be stored on another DLT and it could or could not have high value.\n\nMemes, especially if the by-proxy copyright is explicitly CC0 licensed into the public domain, offer an interesting example of how a by-proxy and by-corpus asset compilation on a VM-DLT provides a lucrative and prosocial business model.\n\n## What’s a DAO to a legal engineer?\n\nPrompted by the DAO moniker, a multitude of more fundamental organizational innovations in computer science and jurisprudence are being developed but have not yet been fully deconstructed into the standalone value they offer beyond a DAO stack, including:\n\n* multisignatory shared possession of by-proxy and by-corpus assets\n* outsource governance to machines with equivalence or deference\n* permissionless arms-length partnerships using composability\n\n### multisignatory shared possession of by-proxy and by-corpus assets\n\nA few thought leaders have already noted that multisignatory treasuries are one of the most important fundamental DAO innovations, an innovation that is clearly an intersection of computer science and jurisprudence.\n\n* Treasuries are definitely important, but this multisignatory innovation has the potential to improve many areas of shared asset management that go far beyond treasuries: a more harmonic coordination in a variety of shared login scenarios.\n\nFor instance, this bear market has shown that Web2 account passwords for login to Twitter, Discord and other shared ( read, write ) network communication assets integral to most DAO stacks are a weak point when human relationships break down.\n\nIn these events, all parties who know the shared password have the power to strike first and take control of a Web2 account by unilaterally changing the shared password.\n\nThis is a bad faith strategic option easily made unavailable to our lesser moments by using Web3 multisignatory possession of account login instead of Web2 login.\n\nThe Mirror platform this document was originally published on is an example of a user-friendly account login that relies on Web3 signatures rather than Web2 passwords.\n\n### outsource governance to machines with deference or equivalence\n\n* **Code-is-law** (code as in computer code) is an extreme legal philosophy that means the final outcome must be how the code actually operates over time, including absurd outcomes.\n\nComparing the Ethereum fork of Ethereum Classic with Ethereum Classic, the market signals that code-is-law has its exceptions in practice.\n\n* Yet the inverse **code-is-not-law** extreme legal philosophy also seems absurd.\n\nWith material public access to domestic-law recognized liquidity, Ethereum VM-DLT is definitely a successful enough first mover example of a free market held together in practice by an Internet code-virtualized cyberdermis alternative to what previously could only be manually administered by very expensive domestic-law professionals.\n\nLooking to a related discipline for insight, at some point mathematicians decided that they wanted to automate some of their work and use calculator machines to do calculations for themselves and other people using math, where possible.\n\n* Calculators have not replaced mathematicians and calculators cannot do all math humans can do, though they can do some math humans cannot do.\n\nLawyers and people using law have much the same opportunities as mathematicians but for the automation of legal calculations rather than mathematical calculations.\n\nAs logical as law is, math is entirely logical and so mathematicians outsourcing mathematical calculations to machines avoid an appeal to humanity base layer of complexity compared to lawyers outsourcing legal calculations to machines.\n\nThis appeal to humanity layer of complexity is the extent the entire legal profession recognizes legal calculations outsourced to machines, including prosocial estoppel concerns.\n\n* **Functional-equivalence** is the legal philosophy that is the minimum ask of the legal community to recognize at least some elements of the code-is-law legal philosophy.\n\nCOALA has posited that DAOs more than fulfill regulatory disclosure requirements because they are ledgers more open than required, and so they should not have to take on the additional administrative burden of duplicating efforts only to meet traditional legal information fixation methods.\n\nFunctional-equivalence might not be nearly as lofty a goal as converting an organization’s operating agreement into effectively a specific purpose virtual operating system on a personal computer, but this minimum ask is still a substantial value add.\n\nGetting functional-equivalence recognized by the entire legal community is well worth the effort considering how much it can improve cumbersome and often expensive manual requirements such as securities law information asymmetry mitigation.\n\n* The consensus position of the International legal engineers guild LexDAO advocates for a **code-deference** legal philosophy, a philosophy as close to code-is-law legal philosophy as possible while also rejecting absurdity.\n\n### What’s code-deference?\n\nCode-deference is a legal philosophy still in development but here are some guiding principles.\n\nLegal engineers are members of the legal community who believe in the latent potential of outsourcing legal calculations to machines a Goldilocks amount, and are actively building machines that do this kind of work.\n\nLegal engineers have the long-term expectation that the emergent outcome of developing legal calculation machines will rhyme with the continued deepening symbiosis of mathematicians and calculator machines.\n\nMachine implemented law is prioritized over human implemented law all else being equal in part because machines lack bias, can leverage nanoscopic scale for immense macroscopic scale speed, follow the letter of instructions to a fault and can stack automation on top of automation many times over.\n\nRegardless of how far the automation branches out into the æther, code-deference recognizes that humans remain at the center with machine final outcomes only lawful if they produce reasonable outcomes for humans.\n\n* **Code-deference** is as close to code-is-law as possible without abandoning jurisprudence while still innovating as much as possible with outsourcing legal calculations to machines.\n* Codeslaw is an applied TUNA example of code-deference:\n\n[https://github.com/kalidao/kali-legal/blob/main/formation/una/TUNAA.md](https://github.com/kalidao/kali-legal/blob/main/formation/una/TUNAA.md)\n\nApplying code-deference to operating agreements and governance documentation in general, this is similar to as many parts of a board game’s rules being administered by a computer rather than the uncertain variation found in repetitive interpretation of rulebooks by people such as dungeon masters.\n\nWhen the computer runs the rules and people interact with them, this arguably provides a virtualized environment on-rails in which consistent interaction guides behavior rather than the no-rails expectation that parties have correctly deciphered and will properly implement documentation each and every instance.\n\nThough DAOs are a technology at the very beginning of their life cycle and as such cannot yet go very many places, the code-deference philosophy will give them authority to be built out as much as possible while keeping them away from absurdity.\n\nWhen DAOs are built out more fully, we might look at organizations without DAO reliance as no-rail solutions that recklessly allow stakeholders to drive their car off the cliff.\n\nCode-deference rather than code-is-law allows DAOs to switch into no-rail mode if continuing to run on-rail would culminate in the train being driven into a brick wall.\n\nThis especially important during the early stage of DAO development as we quickly learn to vastly improve the technology into commercial grade products and, as such, we still often need to go off-road at unexpected fog of war moments.\n\n* The most radical ask of code-deference is that code is assumed the more likely *consensus ad idem* if it conflicts with other aspects of privity.\n\nCompare this with functional-equivalence where the most radical ask is that a DLT is considered an alternative to codified-requirements if functionally equivalent without addressing situations of conflict between code-is-law and codified-requirements.\n\nA very interesting implication of code-deference is that contract law can be extended past privity for by-corpus *sui generis* IP such as no term limit creator royalties for NFT resale.\n\n### permissionless arms-length business reliance using composability\n\nIn practice, MV-DLTs are allowing arms-length developer teams to build legal calculations on top of each other without the need to sign whatsoever, creating long forking chains of impressive automation.\n\nTraditional business reliance often requires protracted conversations and signed agreements with clearly articulated privity.\n\nBut because VM-DLTs are public access, a party can for instance unilaterally build a protocol on top of an existing protocol and this derivative path could be but the most recent in a long line of extension.\n\nIndeed, to ensure protocols integral to a VM-DLT continue being maintained and remain public goods with sufficient and as headless as possible upkeep is a dominant reason DAOs have developed in the first place.\n\nFor protocols, a DAO is an Internet community culture that often through tokenomics includes private entity incentives where required while remaining as public access as possible.\n\nThese protocol DAOs are the dominant proven DAO use case other than multisignatory treasuries, and help solve tragedy of the commons without falling into tragedy of the anti-commons.\n\n## What’s a soul-DAO?\n\nA soul-DAO is a DAO that is controlled by only one human being, and represents that person’s persona on a VM-DLT.\n\nIt might be curious why a technology built for the collaboration between different people offers a lot of value as a technology designed for just one person.\n\nBut compare this idea with the soulbound NFT movement.\n\n### DAO as OS\n\nUsing a corpus-classification analogy, a computer is the organism and an Operating System “OS” is from where sentience emanates.\n\n![the pilot has sentience ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Dtu_PfsquPjrOvxkHLdaw.png?height=366&width=366)\n\nNot all computers have an OS, computers can run without sentience.\n\nSince the only true sentience in the system are human beings, this definition means that at some point eventually in the OS stack there is a human being at the end of it doing the cybernetic navigation.\n\nAn OS is the interface designed for the least deterministic most human randomness driven events that initiate processes within a computer.\n\nA computationally efficient OS might separate a kernel of its logic that has hardly any opinion out from the rest of the OS.\n\nAn app child within an OS parent is also hardly deterministic but much more so compared to its parent; the child app includes more opinion than the parent OS.\n\nAt times an app might be considered an OS, such as a webapp that is an OS for a remote personal server computer machine without its own display port.\n\nAnd though no DOA at this point can be considered a finished OS, general purpose computers existed for decades before a consumer grade graphic user OS became a fully developed product.\n\n### What’s the OS of a World computer VM-DLT?\n\nUsing sentience as the common thread, DAO and wallets are both candidates for what might eventually be considered the OS of VM-DLT computers.\n\nBecause a DAO is designed to consolidate operations within an organization, DAOs will likely always do well adhering to OS structure.\n\nWallets are more like webapps, where on occasion their design should adhere to OS structure but also on occasion their application will require quite a bit of opinion more along the lines of an app within an OS.\n\nRegardless, DAOs are the multisignatory layer and wallets are the signatory layer of the World computer VM-DLT user experience.\n\nA human can have multiple signatures, and must have multiple wallets if engaging with multiple L1s.\n\n### community DAO and personal soul-DAO\n\nIt makes sense for DAOs to start as community programs, given they are the multisignatory layer.\n\nBut there are a lot of advantages to developing DAOs for just one person as well.\n\nA person can use a personal DAO to consolidate many personal wallets in one place.\n\nA person can invite other people into a personal DAO to do executor and other agent work.\n\nPerhaps the most important reason to have a personal DAO is the recognition that balance sheets are very powerful accounting tools which can be improved on by adopting relational database management concepts.\n\nWith relational management, a table can pull information from other tables.\n\n* Applying this multitable concept to a balance sheet DLT, tokens are bidirectionally exchanged rather than unidirectionally handed out, for instance this exchange called a transmutation:\n\n[https://github.com/HausDAO/TransmutationSummoner](https://github.com/HausDAO/TransmutationSummoner)\n\nThis means, for example, that a personal DAO has a total token supply in the amount of time in minutes the person has remaining from the time the DAO is summoned to the time the person turns 100 years old:\n\n[https://app.kali.gg/daos/1/0x10a8c4cDC7E747c730330766F4df9c99341FAB65/info](https://app.kali.gg/daos/1/0x10a8c4cDC7E747c730330766F4df9c99341FAB65/info)\n\nThe value of this is that the most scarce resource each person has is time.\n\nBy transferring their personal DAO tokens that reflect their time scarcity to a community DAO they sacrifice their time to, the liability in sum of taking time from each person is recognized as in balance with a community DAO’s token assets.\n\n* Reflecting a personal DAO to a person’s life energy by temporally tying token supply to lifespan, the personal DAO becomes that person’s personal **soul-DAO**.\n\nThis definition of whether a soul-DAO token is a liability or the community DAO’s token is an asset is relative, and the idea of a multitable balance sheet is only the starting point of understanding how this tally system will unfold and scale over time.\n\nCelebrity is much like a meme, and we naturally put fetishize celebrity faces on tokens.\n\n* A community DAO with a token that does not have much value that also has a large number of various soul-DAO tokens in its treasury indicates that DAO is wasting the latent potential of human souls.\n* A community DAO that helped one of its members become a cherished celebrity, and holds that celebrity’s now valuable tokens, shares in the rewards of that celebrity’s wealth manifestations long-term.\n\n##

The pantheons of Highvibe Network.\n\nWhere Web3 meets elevated consciousness.

The closed systems and digital empires of Web2 are in decay. Councils await. The blockchain is ready. \n\nThe Lion DAO Genesis Collection is being birthed on the Ethereum Blockchain spawning culture at the intersection of Web3 x Consciousness. \n\n**The beginning of an era.** \n\nLion DAO’s Genesis Collection comprises of 3333 Lion DAO Genesis NFTs that double as a membership to an exclusive decentralized storyworld and metaverse community, with the benevolent power to collectively expand. This includes 1650 Lions, 1650 Lionesses, and 33 1/1 rare artworks within the collection. \n\n### The emergence of IP DAOs :: Art is the Utility \n\nOwners have full Commercial Rights to their NFT Artwork. Community owned characters and IP are vital composable building blocks of the open metaverse, and emergent Web3 culture. When creators and collectors own IPs and create value, it attracts more value for the entire DAO. \n\n*Character based NFT collections are IP franchises.*\n\nRather than rely on a single IP owner to create value, a decentralized network distributes IP ownership across multiple creators and collectors.

{"id": "RHCz7PRn2bexrOtPXDYPlKrCEspCCWAl2cFs8u5jT1o", "title": "In web3, community is king 👑", "body": "## Web3 is the convergence of brand, marketing and community. But make no mistake: community is king.\n\nIn the avalanche of web3 pivots, prognostications, and predictable skepticism that naturally emerges alongside a trendy new buzzword, one can be forgiven for not giving a f\\*uck.\n\nThe skeptics would have us think that the hype is overblown (it is), that the rich have taken over (they have) and that web3 is a joke (it isn’t).\n\nBut all of those points — whether fair criticism, knee-jerk reactionism, or simple laziness — truly miss the point.\n\nIt’s not a shock that brands have rushed into the latest buzzword. DUH. That’s what brands do: follow the zeitgeist, co-opt culture and pursue relevance.\n\nWhat makes this time different is that the cultural zeitgeist is in full control of its destiny. Try as they may, you can’t fully co-opt web3.\n\nAnd that’s for one major reason: **in web3, community IS the brand.** Everything emanates from the core community. \n\nThink of it this way: web2 is where the powerful few monetize the powerless many. Web3 is where the powerful many build whatever they want to do — and earn a piece of the action. As long as there’s enough people to care, that is. Without those people, there’s nothing.\n\nThat’s not exactly how it works in web2. Sure, you need users. At least at the start. Eventually, you can build a platform that has sufficient network effects that you can wall these users off and monetize them.\n\nThese people have no choice but to stay. And that doesn’t really make them a community. It makes them captives. So web2 usually ends up with plenty of brands but few communities.\n\nIn web3, that’s not the case. Projects are only as strong as their communities: **the brand is the community** and **the community is the brand**. That intertwined, interdependent relationship is the defining feature of web3 -- a feature that alienates many web2 brands used to the “one to many” model. They can’t quite grasp the hands-on, time-intensive nature of web3’s “one to fewer” model, which focuses on building community one relationship at a time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M1CHuR6zptjR_GRlVPRi3.png?height=924&width=1640)\n\n## The New Community Primitivism\n\nSo what is community in the web3 era? Web3 community is defined by its shapelessness, its inability to be defined. It is whatever it needs to be for whomever it needs to be for however long it needs to be.\n\n> There’s no “one size fits all.” It’s not plug-and-play. It’s not “scalable.”\n\nPerhaps this is **New Community Primitivism**, where the philosophy is simple: build transparently alongside your community, develop incentives that are personalized to individuals and align everything with the broader community ethos.\n\n**It’s the convergence of brand, marketing and community.**\n\nAnd yes, this is all inherently messy: when you give perks and ownerships such as NFTs, airdrops, etc, they are frequently targeted by hit-and-run opportunists that join the community, extract whatever value is on offer, and then leave.\n\nThese mercenary community “members” decrease sincere engagement by forging a false sense of community that eventually pushes away anyone who’s not grinding.\n\nOf course web3 is not perfect! How mature were you when you were literally 2 years old? There’s plenty of infrastructure, best practices, maturing, and general professionalizing that needs to be done.\n\n**Give it time.**\n\nIt’s still the dawn of the web3 era. We’re all building new community primitives together, learning each day in the Discords, the DMs and the IRL token-gated “immersive experiences.”\n\nSome shit is cringe. Other moments are inspired. It’s that messiness that reflects our shared reality. And it’s what makes building communities in web3 so exhilarating, exciting and rewarding!\n\nAs long as community remains at the core of web3, WAGMI! Otherwise, definitely NGMI.\n\n**Community is the brand, brand is the community.**", "timestamp": 1658453069, "digest": "RVm6t5RA_xXVptTHrvsYNMjMQX9I07ySjloyLS02Nuk", "contributor": "0xC8Bf177D6F4D13090f6593953633a604E69076EF"}

Unicorns》的主要游戏玩法是农场模拟。玩家购买Land NFT，玩家可以随着时间的推移进行升级。土地是我们社区经济的引擎，也是独角兽繁殖、孵化和进化的地方。玩家的农场是游戏中的基地，农场可以进行建造和生产，建筑包括马厩、托儿所、工作坊、收集车和农场插槽，玩家可以通过升级土地提升生产力来获益。\n\n农业：玩家可以种植种子来种植浆果，用于繁殖、进化和制作。玩家可以在播种时分配独角兽来增加浆果产量。可以通过让独角兽适当地喂食浆果来进一步提高浆果产量。玩家可以种植10种浆果，包括普通浆果和每个独角兽职业的一种浆果。玩家可以使用浆果来培育和进化独角兽，并作为制作材料。\n\n采集车：玩家可以派独角兽进行采集任务，返回后领取奖励。收集任务需要一只拥有至少一种能量的独角兽。独角兽只能同时执行一个任务。花费浆果可以让独角兽保持体力并且增加潜在奖励。\n\n工作坊：玩家可以分配独角兽从食谱列表中制作物品。在创意工坊中，玩家可以制作建筑材料和物品，例如繁殖和进化助推器。独角兽是开启工作坊的必需品，升级工作坊可以解锁更高级别的制作配方。以下配方类型在启动时可用：材料、孵化和进化助推器。\n\n幼儿园：玩家可以在幼儿园繁殖、孵化和进化独角兽。繁殖：任意两只还有繁殖点的独角兽都可以繁殖，成本是普通浆果、UNIM与RBW，增加浆果可以增加可选独角兽种类。孵化：繁殖24小时玩家可以随时选择孵化，系统将收取一定Gas费，玩家可以使用助推器来提高独角兽继承的能力。进化：玩家可以选择将独角兽宝宝进化为成年以提高能力。\n\n马厩：马厩是独角兽休息的地方，玩家可以升级马厩以增加可分配到土地上工作的独角兽数量。\n\n**游戏场景：**\n\n**角逐：**\n\n独角兽角逐赛是力量和速度的极具娱乐性的展示，取决于独角兽的最高速度，加速度和耐力的分数，分为积分赛和淘汰赛。一次比赛最多32只独角兽参加，只有一只独角兽获胜。部分活动是免费的，有些需要以UNIM或RBW支付报名费。\n\n每一轮角逐中，独角兽都会以这些潜在的结果互相攻击：\n\nMiss：两只独角兽互相想念。\n\n扫视：一只或两只独角兽进行扫视。\n\n交错：一只或两只独角兽交错。\n\n击倒：一只独角兽被击倒。\n\n当击倒发生时，一个10秒的计时器。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hml6JFsF1PV1P-uY0YSwQ.png?height=308&width=612)\n\n**赛车：**\n\n在独角兽赛车赛具有独特属性的不同赛道，例如等级、距离、天气和长度，依然依据独角兽的最高速度，加速度和耐力来评定比分，最终排名越高获得奖励越高。赛车从开发者控制的三个创世赛道开始，随着时间的推移最终交由社区管理。玩家可以通过出售从游戏内任务中收集的游戏内物品或通过在比赛中获胜来赚取代币。此外，拥有游戏内地块的玩家可以通过出租给其他玩家探索来收取租金。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YCoXBDpb_mqiZl13JdbiV.png?height=344&width=612)\n\n**战斗玩法：**\n\n游戏团队将于2022年第四季度推出一款具有PVE和PVP元素的史诗团队RPG游戏。具体内容需等后续官方介绍。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NY-pGBkjk1UxKK9uiVU1e.png?height=439&width=612)\n\n**游戏资产与相关设计：**\n\n**独角兽NFT：**2021年11月15日，Laguna Games向早期社区成员出售了全部10,000个创世蛋。这些彩蛋构成游戏经济的基础。每只独角兽拥有一套独特的技能，由基因决定。创世的10,000只独角兽可以进行8次繁殖（普通的独角兽只能进行五次繁殖）。繁殖需要使用独角兽牛奶、彩虹令牌和普通浆果。独角兽幼崽会遗传父母的部分基因获得相应能力。团队还发行了99个限量版1/1实验蛋，这些蛋孵化出的独角兽没有繁殖能力，但是能力会比较出众。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/h1rKlCywfPwlRO4_CHcyb.png?height=417&width=504)\n\n**独角兽等级：**共有九个独角兽等级，包括六个基本等级：Heart，Cloud，Flower，Candy，Crystal，Crystal，以及三个隐藏等级Rainbow，OmNom，Star。\n\n**土地NFT：**\n\n土地是农场游戏的焦点，代表了独角兽经济的整体引擎。土地NFT共有三种稀有度：普通、稀有和神话。普通土地有9种不同的类型（每个 Unicorn Class一种）。当使用与土地相同等级的独角兽时，玩家会获得增益，使收割、采集和制作更有效率。\n\n稀有土地有3种不同的类型（每个类别组一个）。稀有土地将为整个等级组中的任何独角兽提供增益。神话土地仅有1种类型，并可以增益所有的独角兽类型。\n\n土地供应总量：\n\n普通地块最大供应量 900,000，\n\n稀有地块最大供应量 90,000，\n\n神话地块最大供应量10,000。\n\n土地邻接：玩家可以将土地NFT拼接在一起以创建共享的邻接奖励。游戏上线后玩家能够随意购买新土地，需要支付ETH以及基石，基石通过工作坊制作或者活动获取。每种土地对应的基石不同，土地会根据需求进行铸造。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NFTknJsW53BNmfVuxyPxj.png?height=344&width=612)\n\n**经济模型：**\n\n代币名称：RBW\n\n为游戏中治理代币。总发行10亿，初始流通5000万，持有人能够以多种方式使用这些代币，包括：Stake 对 DAO 治理进行投票并获得 Staking 奖励，从彩虹市场购买高价值的助推器、物品和材料，培育和进化独角兽，支付角逐、竞速和战斗锦标赛的报名费等等，RBW 的最终目标是分散加密独角兽财政部和 IP 的所有权和治理。\n\n代币名称：UNIM\n\n无限发行，通过控制燃烧比调节平衡。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/scxtfA30r1gsTmdIs_rX3.png?height=398&width=612)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/od_r8u-Z6xldgFcX5rJLc.png?height=349&width=612)\n\n**社区热度：**\n\n**Telegram：**\n\n官方群组有多个，最大的群组拥有近1.4W成员，但交互相对其他的宣发渠道较少，更多涉及对于官方客服的提问和反馈。\n\n**Discord：**\n\n频道内目前有3.7W粉丝，5.1k日常活跃成员，验证较为严格，讨论活跃，可见实打实的铁粉比较多，建议多进入DC关注游戏的细节进展和攻略。\n\n**Twitter：**\n\n账号截止目前有4.1W关注者，官方发布项目相关的活动和更新较为频繁，与粉丝互动亲密。\n\n**Medium：**\n\n频道内入驻了游戏制作的主要成员，联合发布游戏的重要节点进展，内容精炼，适合关注重大更新的朋友进行跟进。\n\n \n\n**总结：**\n\n《Crypto Unicorns》相对来说游戏本身的开发时间拉得较长，游戏上线的时间也经过了推迟，并且游戏在前期预热的时期经过了几波爆炒，红利被消耗了一些，但是项目本身还是属于优质的Gamefi，游戏内NFT制作精良设计美观，团队背景强大，投资机构具备较高的资质，其中特别值得注意的是团队的代币锁仓一年，后续两年线性释放，证明项目方还是有心将游戏做长远的。这里最后也提醒各位小伙伴，游戏上线后理性进场，因为当前的独角兽NFT的地板价为1ETH门槛不低，RBW的繁殖消耗和质押产出都是需要考虑的数据。感兴趣的小伙伴要多多测算，最后能够玩赚开心！",

A person starts from the birth of a baby, slowly grows up and matures, and finally becomes a dead body. His life journey is thus over. So what is the significance of his coming to this world? What has he brought to the world and society? What has the world and society given him?\n\nThese thoughts used to scare me, because many people I cherish and love will eventually die, and then I can’t remember them, and I can’t find the last trace of my contact with them.\n\nI also believe in theology in the past, no matter which religious sect, whether people go to heaven or hell after death, or whether people come back to us after being reborn after death. According to the movie “Coco”, death is not the end of life, forgetting is. I believe these are true. I have been unable to accept physical death and spiritual death. A trace of existence that has existed on the earth for hundreds of years has been completely erased in all dimensions. However, theology cannot redeem my heart. Due to various factors of reality, even if I want to honor my dear people on a specific day and have some reasonable ways of remembering them, it may not reach our most sincere Memorial in time because of various factors of time and space.\n\nUntil I discovered Metagrave.\n\nMetagrave is the world’s first metaverse graveyard platform.In short, it opens up a new world in the space of the metaverse, which allows us to place the graveyard of the people we miss in the metaverse. Not only that, it also provides a variety of sacrifice methods and offerings, which can meet our various needs to express our thoughts.\n\nWhat touched me most about Metagrave was that it created a model of Metaverse graveyard platform, and more importantly, it is full of humanistic care, which fully reflected the humanistic idea and destiny compassion with strong humanistic feelings.In the world of Metagrave, every graveyard is unique, and every partner and relative we have lost will always accompany us in a unique place. They will not leave again, they just change a way to accompany us forever in another universe.\n\nIn Metagrave, the platform can also restore the appearance of loved ones through AI. Every time I miss my dear friends and relatives, I come to the metaverse graveyard. They seem to have come back to life, still exist in my world, and stay together.\n\nI still believe in theology as usual. I believe that they live in another world, but this platform can make me more connected with their world, so that I can still feel their existence after experiencing the pain of losing them, with less regret in my heart and more courage to face life.\n\n》》》》》》》》》》》》》》》》》》》》》》\n\n推特：<https://twitter.com/metaGraveGo>\n\n不和谐：<https://discord.gg/TC8tYP3sJa>\n\nReddit：[https ://www.reddit.com/r/metaGrave/](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaGrave/)\n\n电报：<https://t.me/+aTD7DyIpsjxmYTVl>", "timestamp": 1658455926, "digest": "ArhRjIIyImJvoh1WZ0QaBg2oyAROO941hrdwYJIYOMw", "contributor": "0x203EeE974ad1D41263822a58ba69b7fAc89090aD"}

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第九篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并持续推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一次周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n原文：\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n编译：\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n### 第十篇20220722\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】Chainlink - 区块链与现实世界之间的桥梁\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\nChainlink 是加密行业最重要的项目之一，为 Web3 经济提供了最为基础的服务：预言机。同时也提供了不少同样重要但关注度不高的服务，让我们对此一探究竟。\n\n预言机喂价服务连接了链下的数据源，为链上的智能合约提供链下价格数据。Chainlink 通过交易所原始数据、数据聚合服务公司和节点运营商的多层数据集合来确保提供数据的真实、可靠和去中心化。\n\nChainlink 的储备证明服务将链下资产的情况提供给智能合约计算链上的抵押率，通过出具独立的见证报告来证明其储备资产情况，向公众证明偿付能力。重点在于可以做到实时监控，一个已知的例子：大幅提升中心化稳定币储备情况的透明度。\n\n还有一些值得关注的服务：VRF 应用于链上随机数生成；Keeper 节点负责链下计算，并在符合特定条件时激发执行链上智能合约；CCIP - 信息跨链桥额外实现链下信息与区块链的传递。\n\n$LINK 目前仅是支付型通证，但正在开发声誉与警示的质押功能，相信能够在未来强化通证属性。作者认为：下一个牛市会由什么驱动，其中一个值得讨论的主题是加密行业的外部性。其中的重要环节就是桥接外部世界与区块链的信息，而这正是 Chainlink 的价值体现。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/analysts-pick/chainlink-bridging-real-world-and-on-chain-economy](https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/analysts-pick/chainlink-bridging-real-world-and-on-chain-economy)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658457543, "digest": "u-vPbyNUCgbTUlMniFcJyu1hHtf4RlpIpbCqHDLX2IA", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

We originally expected to get <100 users, but ended up with far greater participation. We wanted to recap some of the highlights from this experience. Our thoughts below:\n\n## *Participation*:\n\n* 26,000 unique settlers\n* 34,000 unique visitors to the testnet site\n* 43,000 transactions across the Canto DEX and Canto Lending Market\n\n## *Settlers Feedback:*\n\nThe reception we received allowed us to test how Canto’s nodes and primitives responded to a large volume of users. Additionally, thousands of settlers gave feedback through surveys, DMs, and messages in the [Settlers telegram](https://t.me/+1I1JgueMSbU2NjRh), allowing us to find issues in the UI/UX and rapidly iterate the protocols.\n\nFor example, one settler gave the following feedback:\n\n> 1. Issue adding liquidity in the DEX LP page - i was adding CANTO + ETH - by default, CANTO was on the left side + ETH was on the right - i chose max ETH, and CANTO amount auto-populated as expected - but when i clicked \"add liquidity,\" some kind of JSON error message came up on the webpage; MetaMask was never triggered - so i switched the order of the assets; i.e., i made it so ETH was on the left and CANTO was on the right - all worked fine after doing that.\n> 2. Issue supplying CANTOETHLP tokens on the lending page - when i got to the step of generating a tx to supply my LP tokens, I clicked \"max,\" and the total amount of LP tokens auto-populated - but then when i clicked the button to supply, the word \"canceled\" came up somewhere on the screen, and MetaMask wouldn't trigger - i tried again, and this time, i lopped off a bunch of decimal places at the end of the LP token amount - don't recall how many decimal places, but i think I left only 6 - after doing that, everything was fine + i was able to supply.\n\nOther settlers gave feedback such as:\n\n* a non-sticky cursor when entering values in modals\n* hypothetical borrow limits not changing when supplying to a non-collateralized asset\n* mobile UI/UX improvements\n* resizing issues with the webpage on certain browsers\n\nUsing these insights, we were able to update our front ends to allow for more seamless interactions between users and Canto’s primitives.\n\n## *Overall Reception:*\n\nUniversal accessibility and ease of use are core values of Canto’s primitives. We were happy to see that many settlers experienced this during the Settlers of Canto testnet. One settler commented:\n\n> “It looks like a simple application united under one window. away from the complex structure of crypto is beautiful.”\n\nAnother said:\n\n> “I really like the way NOTE works. I also see very interesting the possibility of being able to add collateral LP tokens.”\n\nSettlers of Canto allowed us to thoroughly test our platform with thousands of real users. We were able to engage with our community and introduce Canto’s primitives in an interactive manner.\n\n### Will testnet contributors join the genesis block?\n\nBe sure to follow and turn on notifications for [@CantoPublic](https://twitter.com/CantoPublic).\n\n\n---\n\n## About Plex\n\nPlex is a group of chain-native builders with backgrounds in HFT, mechanism design, and software development.

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第九篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并持续推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一次周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n原文：\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n编译：\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n### 第十篇20220722\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】Chainlink - 区块链与现实世界之间的桥梁\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\nChainlink 是加密行业最重要的项目之一，为 Web3 经济提供了最为基础的服务：预言机。同时也提供了不少同样重要但关注度不高的服务，让我们对此一探究竟。\n\n预言机喂价服务连接了链下的数据源，为链上的智能合约提供链下价格数据。Chainlink 通过交易所原始数据、数据聚合服务公司和节点运营商的多层数据集合来确保提供数据的真实、可靠和去中心化。\n\nChainlink 的储备证明服务将链下资产的情况提供给智能合约计算链上的抵押率，通过出具独立的见证报告来证明其储备资产情况，向公众证明偿付能力。重点在于可以做到实时监控，一个已知的例子：显著提升中心化稳定币储备情况的透明度。\n\n还有一些值得关注的服务：VRF 应用于链上随机数生成；Keeper 节点负责链下计算，并在符合特定条件时激发执行链上智能合约；CCIP - 信息跨链桥额外实现链下信息与区块链的传递。\n\n$LINK 目前仅作为单一的支付型通证，但也正在开发声誉与警示的质押功能，相信能够在未来强化通证属性。作者认为：下一个牛市会由什么驱动，其中一个值得讨论的主题是加密行业的外部性。其中的重要环节就是桥接外部世界与区块链的信息，而这正是 Chainlink 的价值体现。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/analysts-pick/chainlink-bridging-real-world-and-on-chain-economy](https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/analysts-pick/chainlink-bridging-real-world-and-on-chain-economy)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658459110, "digest": "m5JBnSb38hrjQJCHnCESyln0M478TYFshCt18UWgOZc", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第九篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并持续推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一次周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n原文：\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n编译：\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n### 第十篇20220722\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】Chainlink - 区块链与现实世界之间的桥梁\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\nChainlink 是加密行业最重要的项目之一，为 Web3 经济提供了最为基础的服务：预言机。同时也提供了不少同样重要但关注度不高的服务，让我们对此一探究竟。\n\n预言机喂价服务连接了链下的数据源，为链上的智能合约提供链下价格数据。Chainlink 通过交易所原始数据、数据聚合服务公司和节点运营商的多层数据集合来确保提供数据的真实、可靠和去中心化。\n\nChainlink 的储备证明服务将链下资产的情况提供给智能合约计算链上的抵押率，通过出具独立的见证报告来证明其储备资产情况，向公众证明偿付能力。重点在于可以做到实时监控，一个已知的例子：显著提升中心化稳定币储备情况的透明度。\n\n还有一些值得关注的服务：VRF 应用于链上随机数生成；Keeper 节点负责链下计算，并在符合特定条件时激发执行链上智能合约；CCIP - 信息跨链桥额外实现链下信息与区块链的传递。\n\n$LINK 目前仅作为单一的支付型通证，但也正在开发声誉与警示的质押功能，相信能够在未来强化通证属性。作者认为：下一个牛市会由什么驱动，其中一个值得讨论的主题是加密行业的外部性。其中的重要环节就是桥接外部世界与区块链的信息，而这正是 Chainlink 的价值体现。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/analysts-pick/chainlink-bridging-real-world-and-on-chain-economy](https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/analysts-pick/chainlink-bridging-real-world-and-on-chain-economy)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658459643, "digest": "Cjb_2H07Cn_tbaGnmFQbsdzR_6FYQylFOVnhtUpRMqA", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

Various celebrities and traditional powerhouse brands have issued their own NFTs.\n\nParadigm has completed a new fundraising round of US$2.5 billion. A16Z completed a cumulative fundraising of US$5 billion+.  Even against traditional tech fund powerhouses such as Sequoia Capital, as well as larger wall street institutions like Tiger Global, these token funds have gained the capital and network track to seriously compete.  \n\nWhat's more, the spending power and influence of individual investors in the crypto world have reached an astonishing level. For example, a single JPG NFT can cost upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Crypto KOLs (youtube, Tik Tok, Twitter etc) along with said wealthy crypto individuals are all bid competitors along with “traditional” celebrities and brands.  Crazy.  \n\n\"Ok, if people in the crypto worlds are so rich and wealthy, then why should I myself invest in tokens issued by a new crypto project?  It has already hit its peak perhaps, how can it possibly access the deep liquidity and legitimacy that traditional financing has provided for hundreds of years?\"\n\nI believe that this is the main concern on the minds of the vast majority of traditional equity investors.\n\nSo, what are we talking about when we refer to entrepreneurial financing \"strategies\"?\n\nFor a long time, there has been a misunderstanding in both the investment and financial world. If given the option, the best financing strategy is to sell and transfer equity interests to well-known institutional investors.  They will provide entrepreneurs with resource support and reputational endorsements.\n\nThe practices seen in Web 3.0 make people rethink the answer to best financing strategies. Let us think back, what is the most important aspect of financing? **The core of investment and finance is to reward the people who devote the most resources, energy, and time to a project.**  These are the ones who are most likely to have the long term outlook, most willing to bet on the project’s growth benefits, and can literally speak most directly for the project. These people are the ones actually on the groundworks, are the earliest users who learn how to tool around with the product, and have the skin in the game as well.  If the two respective parties (institutions or a hundred retail investors who are interacting directly with a project) gave the same amount of capital, I believe that most in Web 3.0 would choose 100 retail investors instead of 1 institution.\n\nBut in the pre-crypto world, this could not happen because: \n\n(1) It is difficult to quickly find a large number of individuals to participate in a project investment, which has evolved into crowdfunding. At the beginning of the development of the project, the founder's time is very precious, and it is impossible to spend too much energy negotiating with 100 retail investors. The rise of the mobile internet has allowed crowdfunding platforms to emerge and help start-up projects raise funds. \n\n(2) There is no suitable technical basis or legal basis to guarantee the rights and interests of retail investors. A large number of self-employed investors participate in the investment, and from the perspective of the past equity investment paradigm, it is impossible to register and record on scale. Since the quota per person is generally small and because the exit path of the traditional equity markets are too long… thus if retail investors are restricted like institutions, it is difficult to obtain a substantial income consistently.\n\n(3) It is impossible to clearly define the user's contribution to the development of the project by technical means, and to give incentives at one time in a low-cost way. \n\nWe allow core seed users to participate in an early project investment to incentivize them to interact deeper with a project and make further contributions.  It is necessary to let them know \"what exactly to do\" to be better evaluated and gain additional incentives. Therefore, the distribution of this incentive must be guaranteed to a certain extent, which makes it more convenient on the project side to operate.\n\nThe practices seen in blockchain and token projects solve these many issues from the traditional financing world.  With blockchain technology, emerging projects can find KOLs and even powerful retail investors from all over the world to participate in the early investment of a said project. With smart contracts, users can easily identify their relative token amounts as a percentage of a total project.  Moreover, the project issuer cannot issue additional tokens, and tokens can be withdrawn to digital currency exchanges for cash/stables at any time. With open and transparent on-chain data, both the project party and the user can easily verify the user's contribution on-chain, supplementation of number of active addresses, code providing records, etc. The power of smart contracts also allows the standard for earning early token distributions and providing users incentives to vouch for certain distribution timelines.\n\n###                                                               Ⅱ \n\nWe need to make it clear that *token rights*, like *equity and debt rights*, are parallel concepts and are both financial mechanisms. Therefore, back to the question about why should you invest in token rights rather than equity rights? It is along the same lines of why should you invest in equity rather than take on debt for repayment later.  \n\nTherefore, companies in different eras with different business natures adapt to different financing methods and financial markets. There is no strict definition of good or bad, only a question of whether something is suitable or not.\n\nTherefore, I think it is suitable for listed companies and large real estate companies to implement debt for financing. It is suitable for Web 0, Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 start-up companies to use equity for financing. For Web 3.0 companies, the most suitable financing method is through token financing. **If Web 2.0 companies forcibly issue tokens, or Web 3.0 companies use equity financing, it does not imply a general failure of consensus or financial efficiency. However, it will greatly reduce the development potential of a project through capital structure methodologies.**\n\nTherefore, what is the main difference between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0? For the definition of Web 3.0, please see another series of articles titled \"The Road to NFT\". I will not repeat it here.\n\nWhat I need to emphasize is that Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 is not a which is good or bad question. I have never felt like Web 3.0 is superior to others, as even today most of the wealth of societies is still in the hands of Web 1.0 and even Web 0. Web 3.0 originated from Web 2.0, just as blockchain technology originated from Internet technology. Because of the comprehensive innovation of Web 2.0 in the way of information dissemination, a large number of social media platforms have appeared. In the era where self-media is possible and powerful,, everyone has a chance to be a unique KOL and influence thousands of people without resorting to some official or “traditional” media. The capital utility of Web 3.0 can be quickly transmitted along with information channels of KOLs and friend circles.  This in turn composes the potential and power of a single Web 3.0 project.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5wtFmLoWLyVs2vjNQFzIf.png?height=636&width=1024)\n\nWhen a generation of individuals in a new era rises, they will forget some behavioral paradigms and so-called industry rules that the older generation is accustomed to or has built.  From there, this new generation establishes new mechanisms and orders suitable for their own playbook and rules. \n\n###                                                                 Ⅲ\n\nWhat path should token rights financing follow?\n\nOnce again, let the people who devote themselves to the project the most, contribute the most, and have a long-term perspective share the major benefits. Let them speak for the project as they have the greatest skin in the game.\n\nInnovative financing methods continue to emerge in the crypto world. And the most popular concepts can be divided into two groups, both of which are essentially the same:\n\nThe first group, \"IXO\". \n\nFrom the concept of ICO (Initial Coin Offering) launched by Vitalik in 2013 and exploding in 2017, to IEO (Initial Exchange Offering) in 2019, and finally to IDO (Initial DEX Offering or Initial Defi Offering) in 2021 (today).  It took Vitalik two years to bring Ethereum from concept to ICO  before finally going onto exchanges.  The early participants in Ethereum are daredevils, and they are also loyal believers of the Ethereum platform and Vitalik’s vision for Ethereum. Most of them are programmers, and they spontaneously have made unprecedented contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem.  Many of them have become the core developers of Ethereum. \n\nIEOs are a concept launched by Binance. Through the whitelist mechanism of the exchange, users who have been trading on the exchange for a long time were rewarded with access to strong token deals on the exchange (screening).  These users are qualified core investors. In the process of Defi's development and growth, IDOs can use DEXes to independently list tokens and establish liquidity pools, and allow users to trade. DEXes directly conducts transactions on the blockchain, and the transaction data is public and transparent. \n\nIn order to prevent CEXes from falsely creating whitelists, DEXes can mark the identity of trading users more authentic. By opening bounty programs, users are required to use smart contracts to link addresses in advance, and participate in promotional tasks such as answering questions, Twitter retweets, etc. From the above activities, a group of users who devote themselves to the project the most and contribute the most can be screened out.\n\n**Therefore, what is next? I think it is only a matter of time before INO (Initial NFT offering) explodes.**\n\nBut people in the world are generally copycats. Many people see the explosion of \"IXO\", but they never thought about how to \"enable the people who devote to a project the most, contribute the most, and have the longest time frame, to share, speak and benefit the most”.  \n\nIf you have never thought about an investment from a long term standpoint, you essentially just \"share quotas\" with people around you, even people who may not be qualified investors or truly have skin in the game on a long term basis. How could you and your investors achieve a win-win situation?\n\nCorrespondingly, in the evolution of the industry in the past few years, many \"IXOs\" have disappeared, which hasn't left a deep impression on most people. For example, \"IFO\" (Initial Fork Offering), which was popular at the end of 2017, refers to the joint developers of some miners who manipulate a batch of computing power to hard fork Bitcoin to create \"new Bitcoin\" (typically represented by BCH, BSV, BCG, BCD, etc., but now only BCH and BSV remain alive but have a weak influence). They advocated that \"new bitcoin\" is superior to bitcoin in some characteristics, and then conduct a \"new bitcoin\" to bitcoin holders. They airdropped, attracted attention, and shilled for the transfer of network effects and developers to these “new bitcoins”  This was a short-term trend after BCH forked from BTC and skyrocketed on August 1, 2017. At that time, there was really chaos in the markets. In just a few weeks, dozens or hundreds of \"new bitcoins\" appeared, all touting themselves as a \"better bitcoin.\" Of course, I don’t need to say more about the results :). These “pseudo-Bitcoin” projects that were airdropped to the original Bitcoin community but could not win any core supporters, without exception,soon died.\n\nThe second group, \"XX is mining\". \n\n\"Transaction is mining\" and \"liquidity is mining\" are the two most famous concepts. \"Mining\" is actually a behavior in which users contribute to the project at a cost. For example, Bitcoin miners buy mining machines and pay the cost of electricity, so they share an output of Bitcoin block production. Exchange users pay transaction fees, so they get platform tokens. Defi users, by pledging their assets to provide liquidity, get tokens of the Defi project. In other extensions, there are also many innovative forms. For distributed storage projects, \"storage is mining\", for content creation projects \"creation is mining\", and actions that are beneficial to the project ecology can all be termed as \"mined\". In this process, the cost incurred may become a kind of income of sorts and is actually a \"financing source\" in disguise.\n\n###                                                                  Ⅳ\n\nThere is always tension at the onset of war, and generally the population can sense it.  The grand emergence of token rights financing has already made traditional VCs feel tremendous pressure.\n\nAt leas in Silicon Valley, or on the streets of Stanford University, options rights are not much less attractive than token incentives. \"Join us, we will give you options\" has been to a degree mitigated or replaced by, \"Hey bro, are you interested in my idea? Let's ICO together!\" This is cool! .\n\nWe've been stuck in the old world long enough. The era of VCs are fading away. As Sequoia Partners put it, “Today’s venture capital operating model was invented in the 1970s and hasn’t changed in 50 years”. Each era has different investment targets through bonds, traditional stocks, internet stocks, and then digital currencies. The organizational form of investors will change with the times. From the earliest private capital lending, to bond financing, to large investment banks, and finally to around 1970 with the appearance of early venture capital financing. Now, it might be an era where Web 3.0 users collectively \"crowdfund\" based around blockchain technology with token rights.\n\nIn the next article, I will talk about equity and token rights, the battle between VCs and token funds.\n\n                                                                                                                     February 5, 2022", "timestamp": 1658460139, "digest": "dWs8lYtg5xAG4YE5ockjqwwHXwT59CbiSPQnDLP-K3s", "contributor": "0xA0108609366CDD2d415a4f4Da045243fF8811eB6"}

{"id": "iWwmPrgKyd__0uiL1uQN5mYH66xr5xRy_dEzft-HDHI", "title": "“Crypto Capital” Tetralogy Part 2 — The Battle between VCs and Token Funds", "body": "### Abstract:\n\nThis series dives from a dual perspectives approach; by both being a practitioner in the blockchain market as well as a scholar. My goal is to convey my understanding of this market, consolidate the analytics behind my reviews, and give overall reflections on the sentiments and up to date situation of our industry.\n\nHow should we treat emerging token projects? How can retail investors rationalize the token financing of these projects in the most efficient and effective way possible? How should regulators reconcile with the industry’s potential for self-regulation through technology? How can traditional VCs max impact participate in these emerging token projects under their legal equity frameworks? As an entrepreneur, how to choose between equity and token financing to further project developments? **In my review today, I want to focus on the battle between VC and token funds.**\n\n### Part I\n\nWhen I was starting a business, I had always encountered two soul-searching questions that all entrepreneurs face:\n\n1. What would you do if a senior executive from Chinese tech giants like Alibaba or Tencent and founded a similar project like yours?\n2. What would you do if Sequoia, IDG or Hillhouse Capital invested in your competitors?\n\nAfter entering Web3, people barely ask me these questions.\n\nThe answers are simple. For (1): It doesn't matter, we can just beat them. Neither Alibaba nor Tencent exists in Web3, and even Meta has not succeeded yet in this field. For (2): It doesn't matter, our users across the world will not start fomo just because a well-known Chinese capital is behind the project.\n\nI do not mean to offend any of the names mentioned above. Comparing with Web2, Web3 has further narrowed the economic moat set by geographical boundaries , and all projects are exposed to undifferentiated competitive market globally. After all, there is no such narrative to describe a project as \"Binance of UK\", \"Uniswap of China\" or \"Opensea of South Korea\" in Web3.\n\nThus, when we talk about the battle between VCs and token funds, we should think about who can do better deal sourcing and provide better post-investment management for Web3 projects on a global scale? Although there isn't a model answer, I believe our friends in VC who are now reading this article, may encounter some challenges when competing for projects with token funds at some point.\n\nCrypto space is an industry driven and disseminated by influence. Almost all excellent token funds will have a \"shiller\", which may seem a little depreciated before the Web2 era, but this is indeed what every project needs urgently in Web3.\n\n### Part II\n\nNeedless to say, the high annualized rate of return (IRR) **and the portion of liquidated book earnings and distributions to paid in capital (DPI)** that token funds earn are what makes traditional VCs feel pressured, or even envy.\n\nIn some sense, 2022 is the year of Chinese VCs officially entering Web3. I am honored to have engaged with more than 90% of VCs in China who are responsible for the Partner/VP of Web3 projects, as well as the Partners of token funds (of course, I was one of them too). The most incomprehensible part by VCs is that token funds perceive \"investment\" from a completely different perspective. Let's analyze this perspective on three specific aspects.\n\nFirst, Ticket size (Amount of Investment).\n\nToken funds and traditional VCs have completely different logics in terms of profit calculations and estimations.\n\nFor traditional VCs, startups only **have a very slim chance of success.** As the failure rate of angel round startups is too high, so they tend to invest in Series A startups which have likely passed the most \"vulnerable\" period. For token funds, 90% of the crpyto projects are being invested at the \"**seed round**\" in forms of token. It only takes a very short period of time to trade tokens from primary to secondary markets. It doesn't matter for Vcs whether the project can endure through intense competitions, they only need to achieve liquidity during the project's \"angel stage\". Most of the well-known token funds are more or less related to major exchanges. Profit can be realized if they execute their power of \"**post-investment management**\" to list the token on exchanges.\n\nIn a bull market, token funds will make the following assumptions — We will invest in a project to gain both long-term and short-term returns, and its valuation should be low. We will then build momentum together to get the project listed on exchanges swiftly.\n\nAt the TGE (Token Generate Event), the amount of token unlocked should be sufficient to pay back the investments (e.g. Some DeFi projects have a vesting schedule like this: unlock 20% at TGE, 20% quarterly vesting over one year. Therefore, as long as the market price at listing is 5 times of the investment price, the payback is realized. We can imagine, this kind of project will likely experience downward spiral a longer period after the early fomo wave.\n\nA more important assumption is implied here - in crypto space, token funds are extremely aggressive, especially in a bull market. The expected annualized return on the underlying asset such as Bitcoin are at least 300-500%. In other words, they would expect by investing token projects at \"angel stage\", at least 8 out of 10 will be profitable, and at least one of them will gain more than 10X return. Otherwise, why don't they just buy bitcoin and hold it? Relatively, VCs are excellent enough as long as they could maintain an annualized rate of return of 20%. I have tracked well-known institutions all over the world. Among VCs that has established for over 15 years, only very few of them could achieve an average long-term return of 20% per fund — this is already satisfactory for LPs.\n\nOn the contrary, the liquidity of most token projects cannot reach the actual secondary stock market level. Frankly speaking, except for a few exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Upbit, most of the exchanges do not have the depth of liquidity to enable cash out by fund-level token investors.\n\nTherefore, instead of investing hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions of dollars in one project but cannot cash out, it's better to invest a smaller amount in **multiple projects to allow flexible cash out.**\n\n![Exchange Normalized Trade Volume (1 yr) on Binance (Data source: CoinGecko)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xaY1ROKLiiK9WcEZ7vFSq.png?height=302&width=1024)\n\n![Exchange Normalized Trade Volume (1 yr) on Coinbase (Data source: CoinGecko)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LgkeTsVCMQlda-mii4NlA.png?height=297&width=1024)\n\n![Exchange Normalized Trade Volume (1 yr) on KuCoin (Data source: CoinGecko)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NzyC3YEXmk6UKM5-OXUkQ.png?height=300&width=1024)\n\n![Exchange Normalized Trade Volume (1 yr) on Coinone (Data source: CoinGecko)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BHi2bE5p9Nky1-PlXidx1.png?height=302&width=1024)\n\nFor a long time, I believe there is a fundenmental flaw with token funds — many token funds are only focusing on **primary market investment team**, but do not have good **secondary market sales team** or post-investmnet management strategies, resulting in a lot of \"wasted\" return. On the other hand, most projects invested by VCs will fail, and only very few of them will be listed. Therefore, having a secondary market strategy is better than nothing, but post-investment management and exit timing are rather more important than pre-investment evaluation.\n\nOn the contrary, the fundamentals to improving the performance of a good token fund are understanding when is the best timing to realize the profits, how to set a hassle-free sales strategy from a macro perspective when facing more than hundreds listed token in the portfolio, how to efficiently transfer latest project updates from investment team to sales team, how to allocate appropriate incentives to sales team, and how to ensure having the best risk management strategy in a 24/7 market?\n\nIn fact, the return of token funds are far less than those in the earning reports — I believe when token funds report their past year earning performance to LPs in the end March, there will be significant difference comparing with the rest in May. I will discuss further below.\n\nSecond, project valuation.\n\nWhen VCs first enter the crypto space, they may get confused about why a new crypto project could worth $20M, $40M, or $80M in USD?\n\nIn a straightforward way, they usually compare the valuation of equity and token of similar projects. Then, comparing with equity, is the valuation of token high or low?The answer is that, it is difficult to generalize.\n\nTo simplify the discussion, we divide blockchain projects into three categories and let's discuss their valuation by tiers.\n\nPublic Chain:\n\nSeed round: $30M - $100M\n\nStrategic round: $60M - $300M\n\nPrivate placement round: $150M - $600M\n\nPublic offering round: $500M - $1B\n\nDApp\n\nSeed round: $10M - $40M\n\nStrategic round: $15M - $60M\n\nPrivate placement round: $20M - $80M\n\nPublic offering round: $10M -$150M\n\nWeb3 Equity:\n\nSeed round: $5M - $15M\n\nA round: $20M - $100M\n\nB round: $80M - $500M\n\nC round: $200M - $2B\n\n![Financing Comparison of Different Investment Rounds of Blockchain Projects (Unit: USD)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/emyrY3MKa7LrI8tWepGeQ.png?height=632&width=1024)\n\nThe above figure shows 3 characteristics:\n\n1. There is insignificant valuation difference between the Dapp projects' investment rounds , and it shows a equally proportional uptrend. This is because these multiple rounds of token financing are often completed within a few months or even a few weeks. During this period, **projects usually have minimum fundamental changes but with some sort of \"influence premium\" and \"resource premium\", or even creating valuation differences in order to set priorities among investors.**\n2. The valuation of public chain projects is significantly higher than Dapp. Of course, from my personal point of view, there isn't much opportunity left for public chain anymore, so I won't elaborate further here. **（Please refer to my future article《*Re-discussion on Blockchain and Industrial Investment - The Golden Thirty Years*》）**\n3. Token project has a much narrower valuation range in the entire financing cycle than equity. That being said, the valuation of token projects is significantly higher than equity at the beginning, but their last round (before listing) is significantly lower than that of later-stage equity projects. In layman's terms, token projects are **expensive the beginning and gets cheaper later.**\n\n**To elaborate more on the third point, token projects demise the ability of equity project for continue financing in the future, thereby realizing the liquidity premium in advance and exchange for more rooms for growth in the secondary market with low financing ratio. We will dive into this further below.** This is also the reason why Chinese token funds are not interested in NFTGo as an equity financing company. Because — according to figures above, it is impossible for token funds to understand a project with a valuation range above $100M, does not seem suitable or has no plan for token issuance. But is this really the case? In the next article, maybe you can find some hints.\n\nHowever, sometimes token projects deliberately lower its primary market valuation in order to gain more traffic. As this is the only way to create enough hype for recognition from exchanges, in layman's term, exchange more liquidity with valuation.\n\nThis is an extreme way for some marketing-oriented token projects to seize the market shares in a short term — leveraging significantly lower-than-market avearge for early rounds financing to gain support, with dozens to hundreds \"investors\". For instance, a project valued at $20M but only raising 15%, but increasing investment quota to 100 to let global token funds and \"community investors\" quickly understand this project will definitely make profit in the short time. Also, they will promote the investment quota being scarce and everyone should hurry up to get the spot. After all, the key to bind KOLs and communities together is not how much you pay for marketing, it is to have them skin in the game, and an easy game.\n\nAlso, the price of some projects’ public offering rounds may even be down-round from the previous private rounds. Similarly, this kind of financing tactic is more of a marketing plan. Of course, there won't be too much of token vested.\n\nSince exchanges usually run their own ecosystem funds, projects can build a closer relationship by allowing them to participate in investment rounds and can't be more happy to see that.\n\nOf course, VC definitely can't compete for this projects. Token funds often snatch for \"investmnet quota\" of tens of thousands of dollars , and financial investment will not get a chance. We can often see that the projects have negotiation advantages in token financing.\n\nThey usually show an attitude of \"invest or not, you can't invest more as you wish as we are fine without you\". It's also how projects in crypto world reduce the risk of investors changing their minds by diversifying the number of investors.\n\n### Part III\n\nThird, the number of institutional investors.\n\nOn the other hand, one thing that traditional entrepreneurs and VCs despites —why does Web3 projects always need a long list of institutional investors?\n\nIn fact, this is a necessary product of localization. When a project needs to rapidly expand the market, increase community fanbase, and search for funds with strong capability of localization in various regions. Usually, the most powerful things about these funds are local connections, resources and promotion capabilities.\n\nFor example, some names are very influential in crypto space, such as coin98 in Vietnam and 4SV in South America. However, most people in Web3 only focus on renowned names like A16Z and Paradigm, and turn a blind eye to funds in non-English speaking countries.\n\nSimilarly, comparing with IPO being the core exit strategy in stock market — the most important indicator for China's A-share market is profitability, the most important indicator for NASDAQ listings is technology, and the most important indicator for crypto market is traffic.\n\nWhen the names token funds come together, the message is very clear — this is a project widely supported by the communities around the world.\n\nRemember, the core of Web3 project is not the company size, profit, or even technology, but it lies in the community.\n\nEverything makes sense now — you need at least 15-20 names to build resources and social networks across the globe, plus some financial and strategic investors. It's not surprising that Web3 projects have dozens or even hundreds of investors.\n\n### Part IV\n\nAs for long-term investors like us, we can tell whether a project is financing currency rights or equity, from the financing valuation and methods disclosed by a project, even without looking at its financing institutions.\n\nIt is an instinct.\n\nSo, thinking inversely, when we start blockchain projects ourselves, do we choose token rights or equity financing?\n\nOr more complicatedly- first token then equity, or first equity and then token?\n\nLet's continue the discussion in our next chapter.\n\nMay 15, 2022", "timestamp": 1658460663, "digest": "1tZp1NWey6c7qV0HGsTiY7tijNEZ0H18TkijrTxWZmc", "contributor": "0xA0108609366CDD2d415a4f4Da045243fF8811eB6"}

来源：L2 Beat](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tl4nBKyeP4zuof6ghaT4_.png?height=669&width=1456)\n\n 迄今为止，围绕 L2 的大部分讨论主要集中在“四大”广义汇总上。其中包括Arbitrum 和optimistic rollups (ORU)，它们已上线并拥有快速增长的用户和开发人员基础。\n\n \n\n**四大还包括 zkSync 和 StarkNet 中的 zk-rollups (ZKR)。**虽然性能很高，但两者都没有像 ORU 同行那样受到关注（稍后会详细介绍）。\n\n \n\n然而，有许多 L2——虽然目前鲜为人知——正在等待颠覆现有协议。这些网络为行业带来了独特的设计选择和功能，而有些网络则针对某些特定的用例高度专业化。\n\n**让我们来看看其中一些低调的 L2，看看炒作 \\* 应该 \\* 是什么。** \n\n \n\n \n\n## Fuel\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V-J_Y3zDG_yNKHA2uEvHR.png?height=669&width=1456)\n\n \n\nFuel 是一个optimistic rollup。\n\nFuel 的独特之处在于它使用自己的自定义虚拟机 — Fuel VM — 以及用 Sway 编写的智能合约。这意味着与大多数 L2 不同，**Fuel 不兼容 EVM，这可能会阻碍其采用。**\n\n \n\n**Fuel 还通过使用与比特币相同的 UTXO 模型而不是以太坊和 L2 使用的基于帐户的传统模型来区分自己。**这些独特的设计选择使 Fuel 具有高性能，因为网络能够并行验证多个交易，而不是串行验证（一次一个）。 \n\n \n\n相对于其他 L2，Fuel 还拥有改进的用户体验。不像传统的optimistic rollup那样需要 7 天的提款时间，Fuel 上的用户可以使用原子交换在几分钟内桥回以太坊主网。此外，交易者可以用任何代币支付GAS——而不仅仅是 ETH。尽管与任何 L2 一样，网络仍必须购买以太坊区块空间来验证证明。\n\n \n\nFuel V1 于 2020 年 12 月推出，开发人员的重点最近转移到了 Fuel V2 上。Fuel Labs 团队最近在 devnet 上推出了去中心化交易所 SwaySwap。独特的是，SwaySwap 上的资产完全是 Fuel 原生的，这意味着它们继承了与以太坊上的 ETH 等原生资产相同的功能。 \n\n虽然它们缺乏 EVM 兼容性可能使其增长速度较慢，但​​ Fuel 相对于其他 ORU 的功能和吞吐量应该有助于它吸引开发人员并在长期内扩大使用。\n\n \n\n## Scroll\n\n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c4FPKV0gTLiOjzOnEZYw7.png?height=591&width=1456)\n\nScroll 是一个开发 zkEVM 的 zk-rollup (ZKR)。 \n\n**zkEVM 有可能从根本上改变 L2 和整个区块链扩展格局。** \n\n除了在生产中实施 ZKR 的困难外，**阻碍采用该技术的一个主要障碍是它缺乏 EVM 兼容性。**虽然 ZKR 在吞吐量和 gas 费用方面表现更好，但无法轻松地将 EVM 集成到 zk-tech 中，导致每个 ZKR 必须从头开始构建独特的开发人员工具和基础设施。\n\n \n\n这就是为什么 zkEVM 被许多人认为是 L2 扩展的“终结游戏”，因为它允许 ZKR 继承 EVM 的网络效应，同时保持相同的高水平性能。\n\n \n\n虽然 zkSync 和 Polygon 等其他竞争对手正在开发 zkEVM，但可能让 Scroll 与这些项目竞争的一个因素是它的目标是与 EVM 等效。这意味着部署在以太坊主网上的合约可以移植到 Scroll 而无需对代码库进行任何重大更改。这应该有助于促进 Scroll 的采用，因为它极大地增加了项目迁移到网络的便利性。 \n\n \n\nScroll 目前正朝着发挥这一潜力迈出第一步，因为它最近宣布计划推出一个 pre-alpha 测试网，用户将能够在该网络上进行交易并试用个人应用程序。\n\n \n\n \n\n## Aztec\n\n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PS2VOjJS6Mre0374W5OEQ.png?height=167&width=301)\n\n \n\nAztec 是一个注重隐私的 zkRollup。 \n\nAztec 通过其独特的交易架构为用户提供隐私保护。虽然复杂，但在高层次上，该架构的功能类似于 UTXO 模型，并使用 zk 证明来转移资产所有权，同时保护任何相关方的身份。\n\n \n\n迄今为止，Aztec 的一个主要用例是通过 Aztec Connect 实现的私有 DeFi。\n\nAztec Connect 使用户能够从 L2 内部直接与部署在 L1 上的智能合约进行交互。这意味着用户可以继承 Aztec 的隐私，同时还可以访问以太坊上 dapp 的流动性和可组合性。此外，尽管与 L1 直接交互，但 Aztec 用户还支付了最低的 gas 费用，因为与任何 rollup 一样，gas 费用仍然在所有交易者之间分批和摊销。根据 L2 Beat，Aztec Connect 目前拥有 312 万美元的 TVL。\n\n \n\n利用 Aztec 技术构建的最受欢迎的个人应用程序是 zkmoney，一种交易屏蔽服务。zkMoney 使用户能够与各种著名的 L1 协议进行私下交易，例如 Uniswap、Aave、Compound、Lido。\n\n随着越来越多的应用程序建立在网络上，而且廉价的私人交易的价值主张变得更加清晰，Aztec应该继续在这个利基市场中发展。然而，值得一提的是，与隐私项目相关的监管问题可能会在短期内影响 L2。 \n\n \n\n \n\n## Immutable X\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xFFYbL5mq6Nv22m8O2p6Y.png?height=643&width=1456)\n\nImmutable X 是使用 StarkEx 构建的验证。 \n\nImmutable X 被认为是有效的，因为交易数据是通过称为数据可用性委员会的链下解决方案而不是完全在链上存储的。虽然这意味着 Immutable X 相对于其他结算到以太坊的汇总增加了信任假设，但它允许网络显着降低交易成本，网络完全为最终用户补贴它们。\n\n \n\nImmutable X 由 IMX 代币管理。除了这些权利之外，IMX 持有者还可以抵押他们的代币以赚取 20% 的交易费用，以及包括在 L2 上进行的所有二级 NFT 交易的 2% 的协议费用。\n\n \n\nImmutable X 专注于游戏，在网络上构建了许多备受瞩目的项目，例如基于 NFT 的集换式卡牌游戏 Gods Unchained 和目前处于私人测试阶段的具有 3A 质量图形的自动战斗器 Illuvium。\n\nIlluvium 最近在 Immutable X 上进行了 330 万美元的土地出售，而 L2 还设法与迪士尼、Gamestop 和 Turner Sports 等著名的大公司建立了合作伙伴关系。\n\n \n\n这些合作伙伴关系，以及 Illuvium 和 Ember Sword 和 Guild of Guardians 等其他备受期待的游戏的公开发布，似乎有望促进 Immutable X 的持续增长和采用。\n\n \n\n \n\n## Polygon zkEVM\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cTkyxXh6LItuBB6oSH9sl.png?height=576&width=1024)\n\n Polygon 正在开发一套 ZKR，其中最突出的是 Polygon zkEVM。\n\n与 Scroll 类似，Polygon 的 zkEVM 在发布前一天被披露，有可能从根本上改变 L2 的格局。\n\n**与其竞争对手一样，Polygon rollup 将与 EVM 等效，使开发人员能够近乎无缝地将他们的 L1 合约部署到 L2 上。**zkEVM 还将利用 Polygon Zero 开发的 Plonky2 证明者系统，这是在以 4 亿美元收购 Mir 后被引入 Polygon 生态系统的另一个 ZKR。Plonky2 能够以极快的速度验证证明，从而减少了 L2 交易达到最终确定性所需的时间。\n\n**zkEVM 计划在 2022 年夏天的某个时候启动其测试网，并计划在 2023 年初部署主网。**\n\nPolygon 在其 PoS 链上拥有重要的开发人员和用户群，在收购其他致力于 zk-tech 的团队（如 Hermez）后拥有大量的内部人才，以及持续不断的高调合作伙伴关系，Polygon 似乎已准备好在可预见的未来，成为zk 生态系统中的一股中坚力量。 \n\n \n\n## 多 L2 世界\n\n在 Fuel、Scroll、Aztec、Immutable X 和 Polygon 的 zkEVM 以及本文中未提及的许多其他产品之间，除了“四大”之外，还有许多 L2 似乎有望在未来几个月内实现增长。\n\nFuel、Scroll 和 Polygon 的 zkEVM 都是通用平台，相对于现有平台，它们可能会带来更高的性能和改进的开发人员体验，而 Aztec 和 Immutable X 则继续在各自的隐私和游戏领域内执行。\n\n目前尚不清楚事态将如何发生变化，以及谁将成为赢家。但更确定的是，在可预见的未来，我们将生活在一个多 L2 的世界中。\n\n \n\n**原文链接：[https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/under-the-radar-layer-2s](https://weibo.cn/sinaurl?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter.banklesshq.com%2Fp%2Funder-the-radar-layer-2s)**\n\n**翻译：时江**\n\n**编辑：XL**\n\n \n\n**加入欧科链讯社区，掌握区块链世界最新动态！**\n\n**Twitter：欧科链讯**\n\n**​电报频道：[https://t.me/ok_telegraph](https://weibo.cn/sinaurl?u=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Fok_telegraph)**\n\n**电报社区：[https://t.me/ok_telegraph_forum](https://weibo.cn/sinaurl?u=https%3A%2F%2Ft.me%2Fok_telegraph_forum)**", "timestamp": 1658461202, "digest": "xRLpzS7iNADWZH-z7WVNumTcVN3h-y013KS149jh2cI", "contributor": "0xD5B12730F08472C471172B0a4DC8912965036b8d"}

On July 20, local time, Tesla’s second-quarter 2022 financial report showed that it has converted about 75% of its Bitcoin holdings to fiat currency.\\\nThe bitcoin sold by Tesla during the quarter added $936 million in cash to its balance sheet. The average price of a single bitcoin sold was $29,000, and the company’s income statement showed a related loss of $106 million. From the point of view of the transaction of buying and selling Bitcoin, Musk is really cutting the meat.\\\nMusk has repeatedly said to the public that Tesla will not sell its bitcoin holdings. In March of this year, when the cryptocurrency market fell sharply, Musk tweeted again, “I still own and will not sell my Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin.” Obviously, this time Lao Ma scolded the retail investors and sneaked away.\\\nOn the Tesla conference call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla’s selling of Bitcoin is just a routine operation, and does not mean that he and Tesla are bearish on Bitcoin. Selling Bitcoin is mainly to improve Tesla’s cash position.\\\nSelling in order to improve the cash position. To put it bluntly, it is a lack of cash. I am a little afraid that it will not be able to turn around.\\\nEveryone remembers that this round of Bitcoin’s skyrocketing bull market has a lot to do with Musk’s crazy talk about Bitcoin and Dogecoin. He is now at a difficult time when Bitcoin has fallen by 70% from its high point. People are very worried that if the funds of institutions follow Tesla to reduce their holdings, it will cause all parties to smash the market and escape for their lives. Everyone thought that the currency market would start a crash mode.\\\nHowever, the market will never follow the ideas of most people. The currency market did not drop sharply yesterday, and it has risen a lot today! People have to doubt that the dealer behind it really pulls the plate after cutting the big family!\\\nWhat Musk has done reminds us of another tycoon — — SoftBank boss Masayoshi Son who has been smashed in the coin speculation.\\\nIn December 2017, at the end of the last bull market cycle, Masayoshi Son at the helm of Softbank bought bitcoin worth hundreds of millions of dollars at the historic high of $20,000, and then cleared his position in 2018 with a loss of $130 million.\\\nIn addition, Danhua Capital, founded by the late Chinese-American physicist and tenured Stanford University professor Zhang Shoucheng, lost nearly 90% of its net value during the bear market cycle. Galaxy Digital Capital, founded by billionaire Michael Novogratz, suffered a loss of $272.7 million in 2018 and a loss of $349.4 million in Q2 2021.\\\nThese cases seem to be the best footnotes for “in the case of currency speculation, the giants are nothing more than this”.\n", "timestamp": 1658460496, "digest": "M57xZjn1mzWDKGgAin0RpLWjGkUXPPPl2htPBHpeBqA", "contributor": "0x731644a15A2C445825F7Bd6002870c49B83bc859"}

Avalanche Q1 生态发展报告：底层技术与生态进展如何？\n\n雪崩协议早期定位为“商业化去中心化金融平台”，为 C 端、B 端均提供可定制化区块链服务，与企业机构的合作较为紧密。回顾雪崩协议2022年Q1的生态近期发展情况、链上数据进展、融资信息。\n\n### 1、 底层技术进展\n\n（1）Avalanche技术识别特征：\n\n* 三链架构，X（exchange创建和交易链上资产), C(contract类应用层，创建和执行 EVM 智能合约、构建 DApp), P(platform协调验证节点、创建及追踪子网)，可互操作，异化网络架构\n* DAG数据结构（Directed Acyclic Graph 有向无环图）优化PoS\n* 相对Etheruem，增强了需求场景下的可组合性，低延迟、高速、理论安全阈值80%（不可能三家部分解决）\n* 代码更新速度高，21年上半年最为活跃。\n* 2021 年 Q4进行 Blueberry 升级，支持开发者创建自定义虚拟机及自有规则的独立区块链，这是子网架构的重点。\n* 模块化区块链的叙事\n\n**（2）开发环境**：2021年期间雪崩生态的开发人员增长3倍，生态开发活跃且稳定。\n\n**（3）网络平台活跃度**：生态丰富度高，包括基础设施、开发工具、文化（DAO/NFT/Gaming）、DeFi、企业机构、理财6大类。AEB跨链桥的推动DeFi TVL的爆发。\n\n### 2、生态进展\n\n关键字**social volumn**，体现为机构与生态合作带来的**社区增量、媒体讨论、生态拓展**等多个方面。由4月SushiSwap的扩展起始，其他关键案例有DeFi：Wonderland Finance ( TIME )，NFT+GameFi: ”2021 MLB Series 2 Baseball NFT ”、Cradaba、DeFi Kingdoms，Solunavax Slogan。链上数据增长主要来源于C链。\n\n### （1）生态项目梳理：\n\n作为金融导向的公链，支持174种DeFi项目，原生项目占比40%。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RF3fsctRAz60iQb3TNIDE.png?height=409&width=690)\n\n### （2）投资机构\n\na16z，Polychain，Bitmain，NGC Ventures，Dragonfly Capital、Fundamental Labs、Galaxy Digital、NGC Ventures，Dragongly Capital、SNZ、IOSG Venture\n\n### 3、趋势展望\n\n“**企业级机构搭建 Web3.0 的基础设施”的展望，与机构更深入的DeFi基础设施合作，定制化模块化的开发设计，具有更灵活的生态部署和更好的话题性。**\n\n面临挑战：生态内同质化项目间和生态外L1公链间的竞争；高负荷的性能问题；现有子网的搭建速度问题。\n\n### 观点和问题\n\nAvalanche在L1公链的差异化竞争中找到了一个相对清晰的定位，机构合作、金融、模块化、灵活性作为最主要的竞争点。其中对于机构而言，安全性> 可拓展性> 去中心化。生态内同赛道Daapp的竞争不利于流量的集中聚集。\n\n（1）DAG如何实现优化PoS机制？还有哪些头部公链采用了这个机制？\n\n（2）Avalanche公链目前是否存在明显的竞品公链？\n\n## Part B. “Solana 2022”研讨会纪要：可组合性是优势，并非以太坊杀手\n\n### 1. Solana的基础优势是可组合性，但存在跨链可组合性的问题。\n\n**可组合性的定义1**（Jesse Walden）：如果一个平台的现有资源可以用作构建新的区块并且能够编程到更高阶的应用程序中，那么这个平台就是是可组合的。\n\n\\*\\*可组合性的定义2：\\*\\*1.提供真正身临其境、丰富应用的能力；2.可组合性应该能让应用程序能够在其他应用程序/协议上构建；3.桥接web2的特征到web3。——乐高积木\n\n### 2.文化优势：目标用户更多是大众市场，而不是学术用户\n\n通过面向大众市场体育、娱乐的营销吸引目标用户。\n\n### 3.开发者友好\n\n基于Rust偏码的生态，相比Solidity存在更广发的开发者基础。2021年开发者数量增长4倍，更活跃的开发者社区引发了社区生态和利润的飞轮效应。\n\n### 4. DDoS攻击\n\n认为是漏洞修复的压力测试，更有利于生态快速发展。\n\n### 5.以太坊的竞争对手而非杀手\n\n存在竞争关系，二元共存。在需要低延迟的场景下有更好的表现。编程模型不同使得可以二者长期工共存。\n\n### 观点和问题\n\nSolana是相对独立的公链生态，在其他L1公链的“围剿”下叙事带来的价值虚高逐渐回归。对文中长期共存的逻辑不认可，共存的原因只可能是更加满足用户和开发者的需求。\n\n1. 是否Solana公链相比其他主流公链更容易遭受DDoS攻击？为什么？是源于协议设计缺陷还是编译语言，或者是过于中心化带来的不稳定性？\n\n## Part C  Layer2在2022年将如何发展？看看行业领袖们怎么说\n\n最主流的L2解决方案Rollup：Optimistic Rollup（Arbitrum、Optimism）、有效性rollup（StarkWare- StarkNet 和Matter Labs- zkSync ），共同点为：更便宜的交易费用（低gas），更快的吞吐量，去信任的证明机制，具有从以太坊主网延伸的非常相似的安全属性。\n\nL222：主网用于确定性，L2用于计算。L2 Rollup技术创新属于垂直创新。\n\n### L2与侧链和L1的关系\n\nL2上TVL的增加是确定的，但仍需要易于使用、可访问且廉价的跨链桥梁，以便资本从替代 L1 转移。\n\nEVM 等效性，暂时看不懂\n\n场景化的公链需求，比如对于快捷和低成本要求更高的GameFi类型，适合在L1替代公链（BSC, Solana）开发。\n\n### 2022年主要趋势\n\n桥、费用减少、合并，开发人员迁移，EVM 兼容性和 EVM 等效性取得显着进展，去信任和无缝桥接需要更多时间成熟。从用户侧而言，甚至不需要感知在使用L2。\n\n### 观点和问题\n\n对于L2的认知依然停留在概念的了解，比较难建立全面深入的认知。对于技术性名词的无感知，是一个比较大的短板。目前是黑盒状态的理解。", "timestamp": 1658461853, "digest": "DYFfYdmVvCY4qvp9Dclu6xSuGZ_OeuTEX-L32JRJPco", "contributor": "0x0b2f7f48dB05663083c5619682fb721D9cB33de1"}

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第九篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并持续推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一次周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n原文：\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n编译：\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n### 第十篇20220722\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】Chainlink - 区块链与现实世界之间的桥梁\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\nChainlink 是加密行业最重要的项目之一，为 Web3 经济提供了最为基础的服务：预言机。同时也提供了不少同样重要但关注度不高的服务，作者带领我们对此一探究竟。\n\n预言机喂价服务连接了链下的数据源，为链上的智能合约提供链下价格数据。Chainlink 通过交易所原始数据、数据聚合服务公司和节点运营商的多层数据集合来确保提供数据的真实、可靠和去中心化。\n\nChainlink 的储备证明服务将链下资产的情况提供给智能合约计算链上的抵押率，通过出具独立的见证报告来证明其储备资产情况，向公众证明偿付能力。重点在于可以做到实时监控，一个已知的例子：显著提升中心化稳定币储备情况的透明度。\n\n还有一些值得关注的服务：VRF 应用于链上随机数生成；Keeper 节点负责链下计算，并在符合特定条件时激发执行链上智能合约；CCIP - 信息跨链桥额外实现链下信息与区块链的传递。\n\n$LINK 目前仅作为单一的支付型通证，但也正在开发声誉与警示的质押功能，相信能够在未来强化通证属性。作者认为：下一个牛市会由什么驱动，其中一个值得讨论的主题是加密行业的外部性。其中的重要环节就是桥接外部世界与区块链的信息，而这正是 Chainlink 的价值体现。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nChainlink 是加密行业的老牌项目，站在投机角度 $LINK 上一周期已经有着极为疯狂的价格表现。不可否认的是现阶段 Chainlink 在行业内的基石作用，但无法在 Chainlink 身上发现新的价值增长点始终存在隐忧，以及未来的潜在破局者也存在再平衡的可能性。加密币圈本就是新陈代谢极快的行业、不进则退，但也因此保持了旺盛的生命力，促进行业的发展。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/analysts-pick/chainlink-bridging-real-world-and-on-chain-economy](https://tokeninsight.com/zh/research/analysts-pick/chainlink-bridging-real-world-and-on-chain-economy)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658461922, "digest": "PmE1SknXfcW2ppdTiSTA3P_ZDqM34WWuNhPn08rK3Rg", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

We can do it, yes, but no one asked - should we?\n\nEthereum has [higher standards for data sharding](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum), which requires a significantly more complex solution of combining KZG commitments with PBS & crList in a novel P2P layer than alternative data layers like DataLayr, Celestia, zkPorter or Polygon Avail. This will a) take much longer and b) adds significant complexity to a protocol we have been simplifying (indeed, danksharding is the latest simplification, but what if we go one further?).\n\nEIP-4844, aka protodanksharding, is a much simpler implementation that’s making serious progress. Although not officially announced for Shanghai just yet, it’s being targeted for the upgrade after The Merge.\n\nAssuming the minimum gas price is 7 wei, ala EIP-1559, EIP-4844 resets gas fees paid to Ethereum for [one transaction to $0.0000000000003](https://twitter.com/apolynya/status/1504723682224066561) (and that’s with ETH price at $3,000). Note: because execution is a significantly more scarce resource than data, the actual fee you’d pay at the rollup will be more like $0.0001 or something, and even higher if congested with high-value transactions (we have seen Arbitrum One fees for an AMM swap extend to as high as $4 recently.

We can do it, yes, but no one asked - should we?\n\nEthereum has [higher standards for data sharding](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum), which requires a significantly more complex solution of combining KZG commitments with PBS & crList in a novel P2P layer than alternative data layers like DataLayr, Celestia, zkPorter or Polygon Avail. This will a) take much longer and b) adds significant complexity to a protocol we have been simplifying (indeed, danksharding is the latest simplification, but what if we go one further?).\n\nEIP-4844, aka protodanksharding, is a much simpler implementation that’s making serious progress. Although not officially announced for Shanghai just yet, it’s being targeted for the upgrade after The Merge.\n\nAssuming the minimum gas price is 7 wei, ala EIP-1559, EIP-4844 resets gas fees paid to Ethereum for [one transaction to $0.0000000000003](https://twitter.com/apolynya/status/1504723682224066561) (and that’s with ETH price at $3,000). Note: because execution is a significantly more scarce resource than data, the actual fee you’d pay at the rollup will be more like $0.0001 or something, and even higher if congested with high-value transactions (we have seen Arbitrum One fees for an AMM swap extend to as high as $4 recently. Sure, Nitro will increase capacity by 10x, but even that’ll get saturated eventually, and 100x sooner than protodanksharding, more in the next paragraph.) Once again, your daily reminder that data is a significantly more abundant resource than execution and will accrue a small fraction of the value. Side-note: I’d also argue that protodanksharding actually ends up with greater aggregate fees than danksharding, due to the accidental supply control, so those who  only care about pumping your ETH bags need not be concerned. But even this will be very negligible compared to the value accrued to ETH as a settlement layer and as money across rollups, sidechains and alt-L1s alike. \n\nWith advanced data compression techniques being gradually implemented on rollups, we’d need to roughly 1,000x activity on rollups, or 500x activity on Ethereum mainnet, or 100x the entire blockchain industry today, to saturate protodanksharding.

Note: because execution is a significantly more scarce resource than data, the actual fee you’d pay at the rollup will be more like $0.0001 or something, and even higher if congested with high-value transactions (we have seen Arbitrum One fees for an AMM swap extend to as high as $4 recently.

Once again, your daily reminder that data is a significantly more abundant resource than execution and will accrue a small fraction of the value. Side-note: I’d also argue that protodanksharding actually ends up with greater aggregate fees than danksharding, due to the accidental supply control, so those who  only care about pumping your ETH bags need not be concerned. But even this will be very negligible compared to the value accrued to ETH as a settlement layer and as money across rollups, sidechains and alt-L1s alike.\n\nWith advanced data compression techniques being gradually implemented on rollups, we’d need to roughly 1,000x activity on rollups, or 500x activity on Ethereum mainnet, or 100x the entire blockchain industry today, to saturate protodanksharding.

But do we really need the high security of Ethereum for these?\n\nI think it’s quite possible that protodanksharding/4844 provides enough bandwidth to secure all high-value transactions that really need full Ethereum security.\n\nFor the low-value transactions, we have new solutions blossoming with honest-minority security assumptions.

Validiums also enable usecases with honest-minority DA layers. The perfect solution, though, is combining the two - an AnyTrust validium, so to speak. Such a construction would have very minimal trade-offs versus a fully secured rollup. You only need one (or two) honest party (which is a similar trade-off to a rollup anyway) and the validium temporarily switches over to a rollup if there’s dissent. Crucially, there’s no viable attack vector for this construction as far as I can see - the validators have nothing to gain, it’ll simply fall back to a zk rollup and their attacks would be thwarted.\n\nI will point out that these honest-minority DA layers can certainly be permissionless.

In a world where 5G and gigabit fibre are proliferating, and [30 TB hard drives are imminent](https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1532940630275461121), this is a pretty modest increase, particularly relative to the 1 TB SSD required - which is the most expensive bottleneck to Ethereum nodes currently. Of course, statelessness will change this dynamic.

{"id": "yLqEaeuU8lEqVYJL-Gd__yq8DTxLr1z5HuTi0iHLdO4", "title": "Research DAO 1.0", "body": "*Six months ago, I sought to understand blockchain’s potential as an internet-native platform for new social and financial structures. To continue learning, I am working with friends to launch The HiveMind - a community-run research DAO whose mission is to bring crypto use cases to light and fund projects demonstrating true utility via a grants program.*\n\n*Over time, the community will create a public library of content that will help our audience understand the true economic and social benefits of web3, DeFi, and the broader crypto ecosystem.*\n\n## The Crypto Community Needs To Do Better\n\nOver the past year, virtually everyone wanted exposure to BTC, ETH and maybe even a few altcoins. Yet, rather than accumulating these tokens and using them for their intended purposes, most simply wanted to speculate by holding them and hoping to double their investments in the short-term. Why?\n\nEffectively, the financial upside of crypto was mass marketed while crypto’s technical benefits - and what they can unlock for everyone - were much less discussed. As Balaji has [mentioned](https://balajis.com/mirrortable/) before, many debates surrounding web3 have operated at a 30,000 foot and 280 character level, without enough longer-form discussions about crypto’s true utility in layman’s terms.\n\nNow, as financial markets correct and [interest](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=crypto) from the broader population dies down, much of the excess liquidity that crypto markets absorbed over the past year has quickly left the ecosystem.\n\nWhile speculation isn't all bad and in effect acts as a [force](https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/) for technological development, I would argue that had more people better understood the benefits and potential of blockchain, then they might not have sold so quickly once the opportunity for short-term profits evaporated. There’s a reason why memes like these are pretty damn funny and get so much engagement.\n\n[https://twitter.com/turnernovak/status/1544504508713164802?s=21&t=B1GILrkRC2FVtGWPd3r_7Q](https://twitter.com/turnernovak/status/1544504508713164802?s=21&t=B1GILrkRC2FVtGWPd3r_7Q)\n\nOur goal with the first iteration of The HiveMind is clear - to evaluate and articulate both the current use cases and potential of crypto technology, so as to onboard more builders into the space and ignite a virtuous cycle of development that benefits everyone.\n\n## A Focused Mission to Assess, Evaluate and Index Crypto Use Cases\n\nIt is becoming more clear that crypto is money built natively for the internet age. If designed and executed well, this technology can enable more accessible financial networks with better incentives for everyone. But what exactly do these new networks look like? How do they benefit certain groups? Will there come a time where they benefit virtually everyone? Where do these technologies currently fall short?\n\nThe DAO’s research will be focused on answering these questions. See the bottom of this essay for a list of some themes/use cases that are worth exploring in detail.\n\n## Season 1 of The Hive Mind\n\nIf others have learned anything with DAOs, it's that focus around one measurable objective leads to better chances of success. With that in mind, the DAO’s first project will involve the production of ten research and thought pieces that explore a core segment or theme within the crypto ecosystem. DAO members will be able to pair up or work individually to research and analyze a topic of interest.\n\nOnce published as NFTs via *Mirror* - just like this essay - any content produced by the DAO will be auctioned for proceeds and will become collectible by members of the broader crypto ecosystem. Then, any proceeds received from the sale of the NFTs will be distributed to a community-controlled treasury. At the end of season 1, the treasury will be allocated in the form of a grant to a crypto project demonstrating strong utility.\n\nIt’s important to note that while the DAO’s content will become collectible, the articles themselves will always be publicly accessible via the community’s page on *Mirror*. They’ll just be owned by supporters who wish to contribute to projects that demonstrate true utility and push the ecosystem forward.\n\n## Value Accretion to DAO Tokens\n\nUsing a valuation framework that [Jihad Esmail](https://twitter.com/jaesmail?s=20&t=wzbHzyXt95eF7mLEIbdUjw) explains in his latest [essay](https://forefront.market/blog/tokenized-communities-value) on tokenized communities, we can think of value capture by the DAO’s native token on the following dimensions:\n\n**Production Value** - this layer captures any value generated by the products, services, and content that the community produces. By publishing articles that explore and assess current crypto use cases, and then listing them for sale as NFTs, any proceeds would flow back to a community-controlled treasury that will be allocated to a project of choice in the form of a grant.\n\n**Network Value** - this layer captures the value of belonging to a community with a shared mission or “meme”. The HiveMind DAO will be made up of students and young professionals who are determined to make a difference within the broader crypto ecosystem. By combining our knowledge, backgrounds, and networks, we are much stronger than the sum of our individual parts. That is the essence of a \"hive mind\".\n\n**Ownership Value** - finally, this layer captures the governance value of the DAO token. As genesis community members, we will all have an equal say in how the DAO treasury is allocated, and what future seasons of The Hive Mind look like.\n\nThese elements will comprise the total value of the community’s native token. Each initial member will be allocated the same proportion of tokens.\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\nAt the end of the day, building useful products is the key to crypto’s widespread adoption. There’s no arguing that. But in the background, there is a need to discuss and evaluate what can be done with this new technology, so as to direct both social and financial capital towards the right problems and solutions.\n\nOn an individual level, by creating content that explores crypto utility, you can play a significant role in onboarding the next users and builders to the ecosystem while also learning a great deal and connecting with others in the process. Aside from collaborating to generate this library of content, the DAO’s community will ideally serve as a sandbox to incubate ideas, get user feedback and generate alpha.\n\nIf you are interested in joining the research DAO, you can reach out via Twitter.\n\n## Q&A\n\nHave some questions? See the answers to a few down below.\n\n### What does the workflow look like for season 1 of the research DAO?\n\n![Workflow for season 1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oUFAnfcX1jU83GWjFsMew.png?height=1794&width=1270)\n\n### Do the tokens have a buy-in price?\n\nIn exchange for a fixed share of the DAOs tokens, members will invest $100. This shouldn’t necessarily be seen as an upfront “cost” to joining the DAO, as the funds will be pooled into a shared treasury that is owned and controlled by the community.\n\nAs much as the community's primary objective is to generate content that helps our audience understand crypto use cases, the longer-term vision for the DAO will ideally include an investing component. By starting with a very small treasury, the community can begin to understand what it is like to invest a shared treasury on-chain.\n\n### Who controls the DAOs treasury?\n\nThe community does. For changes to take place (making investments, incurring expenses, etc.), they must be pre-approved by a majority of DAO members.\n\n### What will the onboarding process look like for members?\n\nFor the first season of The HiveMind, membership will be limited to between 10-20 individuals. Rather than creating a waiting list and then onboarding everyone at the same time once the member threshold has been reached, we plan to onboard members gradually. Similar but not identical to what they are doing at [Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/), members will be onboarded gradually over several weeks.\n\n### How will the DAO treasury tokens be created and managed?\n\nThe DAO will rely on the [Syndicate Protocol](https://syndicate.io/), a DApp supporting the creation and management of investment clubs. Using the Syndicate platform, members will be able to contribute funds, and track the transactions that are executed by the DAO. Members will also be able to see the value of the DAO's treasury that is attributable to them.\n\n### Who will want to purchase the writing pieces? Why would anyone donate funds to our project?\n\nDuring the first season of The HiveMind, the DAO will effectively operate as a non-profit, redistributing any proceeds that are raised back into the community via a grant. Yet, rather than simply asking for funds from the broader ecosystem, members of the DAO are working for it by publishing content that will help onboard more users into the space. In this way, the grant enables the DAO to apply its research in a real-world setting, as we search for a project that demonstrates strong utility.\n\nOn our socials, we will need to growth hack our way to reaching a larger audience, while aiming to target those who are open to supporting new types of grant programs that enable smaller communities to issue micro-grants. \n\n### What will season 1 members be responsible for?\n\n1. Researching a topic of interest \n2. Finding a mentor within the ecosystem for feedback\n3. Writing, publishing and shilling your article \n\n### What sort of time commitment will this require? \n\nIdeally, articles will be written and published between the end of September and December 31st on a periodic basis. Each DAO member will work on a topic of their liking, and at the beginning of the period, DAO members will choose an expected delivery date for their piece.  \n  \n Estimated time to research, discuss, and write an article = 25-30 hours \n\n### Will DAO members have a say in how the community operates?\n\nOf course. What you are reading right now is simply a vision for how the first iteration of the community will run. As a small group, we will test out several different ways of going about things to find an optimal approach. \n\n### Should we explore the idea of giving donors (NFT owners) a say in where the grant is allocated?\n\nProbably. To be discussed as a group. \n\n### What could go wrong? What are some uncertainties and risks that we should consider? \n\nThe following risks should be considered and mitigated away:\n\n* The risk of not finding mentors to review and provide advice over our content \n* The risk of not raising funds from to then allocate via a grant \n\nWith a well thought out outreach strategy and value proposition to both mentors and potential donors, these risks can be reduced. Although, we’ll never know what happens until we try. \n\n### What is the long-term vision for The HiveMind?\n\nIn the long-run, HiveMind will become a venture studio where members can pitch and discuss crypto projects with potential for solving real-world problems. Any ideas that show promise could be pursued by the community or a subset of the community.\n\n### What are some examples of topics that could be explored as part of season 1?\n\nHere’s a non-exhaustive list of some themes/use cases that are worth exploring in detail:\n\n* What does it truly mean for a network to be permissionless? Why does it matter?\n* What are tokens and why do some call them “equity 2.0”? Why should platform users care about tokens?\n* What are the downsides to a project issuing tokens early on? How can they be mitigated? How could this affect users?\n* What happened during the ICO boom in 2018? Was the recent NFT boom much different? How can we do better?\n* What are ZK proofs? How do they help scale blockchains and speed up the adoption of on-chain credentials?\n* How can on-chain credentials / soulbound tokens unlock new opportunities for users to participate in an open internet economy?\n* How are web3 marketplaces different from their web2 counterparts?\n* Are DAOs really the future of remote work? What have been the most successful applications of DAOs so far?\n* Why should we care about DeFi? How is DeFi different from CeFi? How exactly can you earn yield in DeFi?\n* What even is DeSci? How can it democratize and improve access to scientific research and content?", "timestamp": 1658462998, "digest": "y_HthdX2VREqfaVHEA1x6iH8LnM8HYDbLz3RVl_X1Jw", "contributor": "0xEe38E983D827183266AD3E455e7e4747D91e7237"}

Note: because execution is a significantly more scarce resource than data, the actual fee you’d pay at the rollup will be more like $0.0001 or something, and even higher if congested with high-value transactions (we have seen Arbitrum One fees for an AMM swap extend to as high as $4 recently.

Side-note: I’d also argue that protodanksharding actually ends up with greater aggregate fees than danksharding, due to the accidental supply control, so those who only care about pumping your ETH bags need not be concerned. But even this will be very negligible compared to the value accrued to ETH as a settlement layer and as money across rollups, sidechains and alt-L1s alike.\n\nWith advanced data compression techniques being gradually implemented on rollups, we’d need to roughly 1,000x activity on rollups, or 500x activity on Ethereum mainnet, or 100x the entire blockchain industry today, to saturate protodanksharding.

But do we really need the high security of Ethereum for these?\n\nI think it’s quite possible that protodanksharding/4844 provides enough bandwidth to secure all high-value transactions that really need full Ethereum security.\n\nFor the low-value transactions, we have new solutions blossoming with honest-minority security assumptions. [Arbitrum AnyTrust](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/introducing-nova-arbitrum-anytrust-mainnet-is-open-for-developers-9a54692f345e) is an excellent such solution, a significant step forward over sidechains or alt-L1s. Validiums also enable usecases with honest-minority DA layers. The perfect solution, though, is combining the two - an AnyTrust validium, so to speak. Such a construction would have very minimal trade-offs versus a fully secured rollup. You only need one (or two) honest party (which is a similar trade-off to a rollup anyway) and the validium temporarily switches over to a rollup if there’s dissent. Crucially, there’s no viable attack vector for this construction as far as I can see - the validators have nothing to gain, it’ll simply fall back to a zk rollup and their attacks would be thwarted.\n\nI will point out that these honest-minority DA layers can certainly be permissionless.

My memory of high school is struggling to get out of warm bed around 6:30 AM and being attacked by east coast cold weather. My memory of college is why on earth can’t I find a place on such a big campus just to sleep without distraction for 10 mins.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3IRrI5xKhr6Ogm9HM5ZwY.png?height=512&width=512)\n\nAfter I quit my job, there has been a period of time when I start to wake up naturally without an alarm clock at around 7 AM in the morning. It’s kind of amazing because when I was working, I was struggling until the last minute to get on the computer and start my day. That struggle has followed me throughout my “socially recognized” journey. It was inhumane.\n\nI start to understand the perspective of other people. Why would someone quit their perspective fancy jobs and start (or even quit for) a YouTube channel? Why would my smart-arse aunt decide to not pursue a career in computer science after a year of a successful corporate job and failed start-up but instead start to do e-commerce?\n\nThe answer to the first question is obvious, but it was puzzling me when I didn’t start working. Who doesn’t want to have control over their life and schedule and earn more than they would have in the corporate world by doing projects that actually excite them? Similarly, my aunt is happy with just enough money to cover her living expense, and surrounded by cats she loves and a partner who’s good at cooking.\n\nCan’t fool oneself into liking one’s job seems to be the tradition of my family. My mom also quit her job when she was around my age. She just can’t find any meaning in her job and she can’t pretend that she likes her job and keep working just like her other colleagues.\n\n![Transparent meditation rooms made of petal-shaped glasses spreading in a natural environment, designed by Zaha Hadid](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/flD8-0U4T3PJzXhZzqEbD.png?height=1024&width=1024)\n\nI was always joking that I came to the world as a lazy person survival index in this world - how lazy you could be in this era and still live a good life?

We make six figures (ironically, six figures is not enough to live in NYC anymore), and we then consume all the money by buying unnecessarily expensive food/cloth and experiences without really getting truly happy. The book \\*\\*\\*The Molecule of More \\*\\*\\*explained this phenomenon super well, highly recommend it to get to know more about the origin of the behavior of workaholic people. In short, people who are dopaminergic tend to find more things to do, and more people to fuck, without feeling truly happy after accomplishing their goals. They are always on their way to finding the next seemingly exciting things to do. It turns out that dopamine doesn’t give you happiness, it only raises your expectation about happiness. So one would work hard for that goal. But the promised long-last happiness would never show up after one achieved their goal.\n\nIn the ***Controlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction*** episode by The Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Huberman also talks about how to lower the baseline of dopamine than trying to get dopamine hit to have a more sustainable and healthy relationship with happiness. For example, the water after exercise feels better than any beverages, the food after a day of fasting is amazingly delicious. I had this experience living in a desert for three months and everything just tastes so different in a good way in that forced scarcity environment. However, the forced scarcity environment is not enough, the secret ingredient is actually human connections. With so many things going on throughout the day with interesting people, I never had the idea to waste my money or time on other material stuff or binge-watching TV shows. Human interactions, especially the creative and nurturing ones, are what bring people from the future to the present, and truly feel happy and fulfilled.\n\nWhy can’t our relationship with work and studying also be ***nurturing***?\n\n![A futuristic meditation building designed by Zaha Hadid, surrounded by forest and lakes ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/InydeUSMcv8NYVgEn9b_R.png?height=1024&width=1024)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658465152, "digest": "XAuqUySnjby4tBRpo4vsiMnjizQrkzMQ--3LfCl3XeY", "contributor": "0x00523fe9D52104645058CA0b7741b5Fd44931706"}

Focusing on the phone first, your preorder will ensure that you’re among the first to get the Pixel 6A on or close to launch day, which is Thursday, July 28th. Google announced the release date all the way back at its I/O conference in May, and we’ve been waiting very patiently.\n\nThe same goes for the $199 Pixel Buds Pro (scroll down to see a $15 off deal), Google’s first wireless earbuds to include active noise cancellation and ship in multiple bright color options. Those are releasing the same day, and you can place a preorder right now.\n\n[We have a review of the Pixel 6A right here from Allison Johnson](https://www.theverge.com/e/23036083), and we’ll have a full review of the Pixel Buds Pro within the coming days. But whichever gadget you’re after, we’ve pulled together some buying links and promotions that you may want to know about.\n\n## WHERE TO PREORDER THE PIXEL 6A\n\nCompared to the 6.4-inch Pixel 6, the Pixel 6A’s 6.1-inch OLED screen is much better suited to people with smaller hands or who just prefer a smaller phone. It has some key traits in common with Google’s pricier flagship phones, most notably that it has the same Tensor processor. Also, its general design (which blends the Pixel 6 and the upcoming Pixel 7) and Android software experience are familiar.\n\nIts camera hardware is one section that is taking a hit due to the lower price, though it should still deliver excellent photos compared to other phones in its price range. It features two rear cameras, one of which is a main 12.2-megapixel camera, while the other is a 12-megapixel ultrawide lens with a 114-degree field of view. It has an 8-megapixel selfie cam.", "timestamp": 1658466279, "digest": "9F2O1sbU_nXk5RD5qbl6xgOIcmrmsgLSnA1SzAoz4Tg", "contributor": "0x0F03C286B0eA8F092D1CF7a7B3c1073cF11a108F"}

Peaster*\n\n*编译：TechFlow intern*\n\n以太坊的未来是通过 Rollup 扩展的， 而一类特殊的 Rollup——与以太坊虚拟机兼容的 ZK Rollup——是未来实现这一情景最有希望的方式。\n\n放眼未来，可以毫不夸张地说，“zkEVM”方案将成为一般 Web3 项目（包括 NFT ）的游戏规则改变者。\n\n### 什么是 zkEVM？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dVs7BcE5Yl_GihIYDs9nC.png?height=471&width=895)\n\nRollups 是 L2 的扩展解决方案，因为它们的工作是在以太坊 L1 之上，目的是让以太坊的交易变得实惠和快速。目前市面上最流行的两种类型的 Rollups 是 Optimistic Rollups 和 ZK Rollups。\n\n这两种类型都在链下执行交易，即在以太坊 L1 之外，这两种类型也都通过将其批量交易数据发布到以太坊上来继承以太坊的广泛安全保障。Optimistic Rollups 和 ZK Rollups 的不同之处在于欺诈证明和零知识有效性证明，以及它们优势的不同。\n\n从一开始，Optimistic Rollups 就很适合 ”一般的 EVM 计算“，这意味着**以太坊项目——比如 NFT 项目——可以轻松移植使用 Solidity 编写的 L1 智能合约，或者在这些 L2 上创建类似 L1 的智能合约**。\n\n相比之下，ZK Rollups 非常高效和安全，而且随着时间的推移，这个特点会越发明显。不过，迄今为止，这种 Rollup 因涉及某些技术上的差别，并没有提供 EVM 的兼容性。\n\n所以，**具有兼容 EVM 执行环境的 ZK Rollup 就是 zkEVM**。到目前为止，还没有这样的项目落地，所以这就是为什么 zkEVM 的进步代表了 ZK Rollups 的 \"圣杯\"：**因为它们最终允许这些 L2 将通用的 EVM 计算与零知识证明所提供的效率结合起来**。\n\n正如 V 神所预测的那样，这种水平的升级将有助于 ZK Rollups 在所有用例的竞争中胜出。而现在，”所有用例 “包含了一个大型 NFT 生态系统。但在我们谈论 zkEVM+NFT 的影响之前，让我们简单地回顾一下本周的发展，看看 zkEVM 的未来是如何在此时此地实现的。\n\n### **三个新的 zkEVM 公告**\n\n7 月 18 日星期一，**Scroll 团队为其基于 zkEVM 的 ZK Rollup 发布了一个 Pre-Alpha 测试网**，与 Scroll 同名：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VrnRusLVCvaLZDfSgcQqi.png?height=178&width=899)\n\n然后在 7 月 20 日星期三，又发布了另外两个重要的 zkEVM 公告：\n\n* zkSync 的建设者 Matter Labs 透露，zkSync 2.0，一个基于 zkEVM 的 ZK Rollup，\"将在 100 天后在主网上线\"。\n* **Polygon 推出了 Polygon zkEVM 并实现开源，并且即将推出公共测试网**。值得注意的是，这个 ZK Rollup 的设计不仅仅是为了 EVM 的兼容性，而且是为了与 EVM 完全等效，这意味着在这个 ZK Rollup 上编写代码和使用工具与在以太坊上没有区别，这对 Web3 建设者来说非常友好。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UXvSZMgZfSTI1Q91vo6-_.png?height=463&width=871)\n\n### **为什么 zkEVM 对 NFT 来说很重要？**\n\n我们正朝着「基于 zkEVM 的 zk rollups 将成为扩展 Web3 项目的黄金标准」的未来发展。\n\n由于以加密而不是以经济激励为基础，**ZK Rollup 相对来说比 Optimistic  Rollup 更安全**。多个案例表明，**ZK Rollup 还大幅降低了交易所需的成本**。此外，**从 ZK Rollup 中提取 NFT 最快只需 15 分钟，而 Optimistic  Rollup 则需要等待 1 周左右的时间**。\n\n因此，**快速且实惠的交易+极高的安全保证+EVM 兼容性+NFT 快速提取=zkEVM**。\n\n事实上，早期 NFT 生态系统的瓶颈一直是以太坊 L1 的技术限制，以及随之而来的糟糕用户体验，比如昂贵的交易费。zkEVM 的到来和发展将有助于彻底打破这一瓶颈，让 NFT 项目随时为数百万用户提供良好的以太坊体验。\n\n还值得注意的是，zkEVM 的未来可能会更加光明。因为在今年晚些时候，以太坊备受期待的 Merge 就会进行更新，但这并不是路线图的终点。在 Merge 之后，以太坊将会迎来 The Surge，并通过引进分片技术，为 Rollup 的可扩展性带来更大改进。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FfDjDN59PxGypOVo1SWFP.png?height=740&width=681)\n\n这意味着**具有超低交易成本和超高性能 L2 即将到来**，这些升级使 NFT 能够更有准备地走向世界舞台。从长远来看，以太坊本身可能会从 EVM 迁移到 zkEVM 模式，因此**NFT 也很有可能在未来通过 zkEVM 运行**。在加密货币领域，有时你会得到一个难得的机会，让你十分清晰的看到未来，而这无疑是其中之一。\n\n[原文链接](https://metaversal.banklesshq.com/p/zkevm-a-huge-unlock-for-nfts-)\n\n***深潮 TechFlow 是由社区驱动的深度内容平台，致力于提供有价值的信息，有态度的思考。***\n\n> ***社区：***\n>\n> 公众号：深潮 TechFlow\n>\n> 订阅频道：<https://t.me/TechFlowDaily>\n>\n> 电报：<https://t.me/TechFlowPost>\n>\n> 推特：[@TechFlowPost](https://twitter.com/TechFlowPost)\n\n*进微信群添加助手微信：blocktheworld*\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1658468314, "digest": "gOut87GQdavhkNswDNRolX7h5-_pG6bzC17gig6hubo", "contributor": "0x0E58bB9795a9D0F065e3a8Cc2aed2A63D6977d8A"}

{"id": "r9I1QnQZBD73rTqFiJnGLZycpQNudCgr-iRD1R2NtBw", "title": "4844 and Done", "body": "At EthCC yesterday, Vitalik joked “[should we cancel sharding?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGjFTzRTH3Q)”\n\nThere were no takers.\n\nI raise my hand virtually and make the case for why Ethereum should cancel danksharding.\n\nThe danksharding dream is to enable rollups to achieve global scale while being fully secured by Ethereum. We can do it, yes, but no one asked - should we?\n\nEthereum has [higher standards for data sharding](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum), which requires a significantly more complex solution of combining KZG commitments with PBS & crList in a novel P2P layer than alternative data layers like DataLayr, Celestia, zkPorter or Polygon Avail. This will a) take much longer and b) adds significant complexity to a protocol we have been simplifying (indeed, danksharding is the latest simplification, but what if we go one further?).\n\n[EIP-4844, aka protodanksharding](https://www.eip4844.com/), is a much simpler implementation that’s making serious progress. Although not officially announced for Shanghai just yet, it’s being targeted for the upgrade after The Merge.\n\nAssuming the minimum gas price is 7 wei, ala EIP-1559, EIP-4844 resets gas fees paid to Ethereum for [one transaction to $0.0000000000003](https://twitter.com/apolynya/status/1504723682224066561) (and that’s with ETH price at $3,000). Note: because execution is a significantly more scarce resource than data, the actual fee you’d pay at the rollup will be more like $0.001 or something, and even higher if congested with high-value transactions (we have seen Arbitrum One fees for an AMM swap extend to as high as $4 recently. Sure, Nitro will increase capacity by 10x, but even that’ll get saturated eventually, and 100x sooner than protodanksharding, more in the next paragraph.) Once again, your daily reminder that data is a significantly more abundant resource than execution and will accrue a small fraction of the value. Side-note: I’d also argue that protodanksharding actually ends up with greater aggregate fees than danksharding, due to the accidental supply control, so those who only care about pumping your ETH bags need not be concerned. But even this will be very negligible compared to the value accrued to ETH as a settlement layer and as money across rollups, sidechains and alt-L1s alike.\n\nWith advanced data compression techniques being gradually implemented on rollups, we’d need to roughly 1,000x activity on rollups, or 500x activity on Ethereum mainnet, or 100x the entire blockchain industry today, to saturate protodanksharding. There’s tremendous room for growth without needing danksharding. (Addendum: Syscoin is building a [protodanksharding-like solution](https://syscoin.org/news/roadmap-development-updates-mid-2022) and estimate a similar magnitude of data being “good enough”.)\n\nNow, with such negligible fees, we could see a hundred rollups blossom, and eventually it’ll be saturated with tons of low value spammy transactions. But do we really need the high security of Ethereum for these?\n\nI think it’s quite possible that protodanksharding/4844 provides enough bandwidth to secure all high-value transactions that really need full Ethereum security.\n\nFor the low-value transactions, we have new solutions blossoming with honest-minority security assumptions. [Arbitrum AnyTrust](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/introducing-nova-arbitrum-anytrust-mainnet-is-open-for-developers-9a54692f345e) is an excellent such solution, a significant step forward over sidechains or alt-L1s. Validiums also enable usecases with honest-minority DA layers. The perfect solution, though, is combining the two - an AnyTrust validium, so to speak. Such a construction would have very minimal trade-offs versus a fully secured rollup. You only need one (or two) honest party (which is a similar trade-off to a rollup anyway) and the validium temporarily switches over to a rollup if there’s dissent. Crucially, there’s no viable attack vector for this construction as far as I can see - the validators have nothing to gain, it’ll simply fall back to a zk rollup and their attacks would be thwarted.\n\nI will point out that these honest-minority DA layers can certainly be permissionless. A simple design would be top N elected validators. Also, there are even more interesting designs like [Adamantium](https://ethresear.ch/t/adamantium-power-users/9600) - which could also be made permissionless.\n\nThe end result is with a validium settling to a permissionless honest-minority data layer, you have security that while clearly inferior than a full Ethereum rollup, are also significantly superior than an alt-L1, sidechain, or even a validium settling to an honest-majority data layer (like Avail or Celestia) in varying magnitudes. Finally, with volitions, users get the choice, at a per-user or per-transaction level. This is without even considering those using the wide ocean of alternate data solutions, such as Metis.\n\nProtodanksharding increases system requirements by approximately [8 Mbps and 200 GB hard drive](https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1513868637307691009) (note: can be hard drive, not SSD, as it’s sequential data). In a world where 5G and gigabit fibre are proliferating, and [30 TB hard drives are imminent](https://twitter.com/epolynya/status/1532940630275461121), this is a pretty modest increase, particularly relative to the 1 TB SSD required - which is the most expensive bottleneck to Ethereum nodes currently. Of course, statelessness will change this dynamic, and danksharding light clients will be awesome - but they are not urgent requirements. Meanwhile, bandwidth will continue [increase 5x faster than compute](https://twitter.com/apolynya/status/1545807412560465920), and hard drives & optical tapes represent [very cheap solutions to historical storage](https://polynya.mirror.xyz/EpFL1V1amxa8maE-TyjfiifJMij_KZNMvReTDxpVoA4), so EIP-4844 can continue expanding and accommodating more transactions on rollups for the usecases that really need full Ethereum security. Speaking of how cheap historical storage is, external data layers can easily scale up to millions of TPS today when paired with validium-like constructions.\n\nValidity proofs can be quite large. If we have, say, 1,000 zk rollups settling a batch every single slot, they can add up and saturate big parts of protodanksharding. But with recursive proofs, they don’t need to settle every single slot. You effectively have a hybrid - sovereign rollups every second, settled rollups every minute or whatever. This is perfectly fine, and at all times come with only an honest-minority trust assumption assuming a decentralized setup.\n\nOne route is to not cancel danksharding outright, but just implement it much later. I think Ethereum researchers should continue developing danksharding, as they are the only team building a no-compromise DA layer. We will see alternate DA layers implement it (indeed, DataLayr is based on danksharding, with some compromises) - let them battle-test it for many years. Eventually, danksharding becomes simple and battle-tested enough - maybe in 2028 or something - we can gradually start bringing some sampling nodes online, and complete the transition over multiple years.\n\nFinally, sincerely, I don’t actually have any strong opinion. I’m just an amateur hobbyist with zero experience or credentials in building blockchain systems - for me this is a side hobby among 20 other hobbies, no more and no less. All I wanted to do here was provide some food for thought. Except that data will be negligibly cheap and data availability sampled layers (basically offering a product with unlimited supply, but limited demand) will accrue negligible value in the current paradigm - that’s the only thing I’m confident about.", "timestamp": 1658468036, "digest": "OTKgDapv4DyIQP6m9hVouqdE9hX7KMgbEihIKRkXK9s", "contributor": "0x429F9aDA43e9F345CbB85EC88681BB70Df808892"}

And though they will not come roaring back anytime soon, the downdraft in prices is nearly over.\n\n* \n\nLooking out on the next five years — the shortest horizon prudent for stocks given their volatility, and thus risk — annual stock returns in the mid-single digits seem likely. Sure, these aren't the double-digit returns of the two decades since the dot-com bubble burst, but they are solid returns nonetheless.\n\n* \n\nMy optimism reflects the view that stock investors have internalized a stark reality: To combat high inflation, the Federal Reserve will have to raise rates aggressively in the months ahead. Fed officials have made it clear they plan to double the [federal funds rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS), the [interest rate](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20220615.htm) they directly control, by early next year.

{"id": "YKrnHS6RBqO3_BfYfAVK8qRgov_JurxsiNXO8RihNn0", "title": "STOP ANALYZING ETH PRICE!", "body": "Recently, ETH's price SOARED.\n\nI saw many people sharing their thoughts about the reason.\n\nSTOP ANALYZING. ETH is definitely a good project, and so is the coin. Then, will ETH surge or slip? It depends on the manipulator -- intending to make the counterparty's market index explode (1/5 of the BTC market value, 5-10 times its liquidation amount).\n\nManipulators cheer as retail investors analyze. -- This best fits in the ETH market.\n\nLet’s first talk about the logic of secondary ETH market circulation. The issuance of ICO defined the early ETH as manipulated, unlike the later ETH through mining or the BTC through mining output from the beginning. Mining is decentralized. Therefore, ETH could be manipulated -- people who participate the most in ICO in the early stage gain the greatest ETH.\n\nWe could understand such fluctuations for the position scales of hundreds of millions, billions, or ten billion.\n\nHowever, it is not the story for ETH when looking at its candlestick chart. It is particularly noteworthy that, half a year ago, the ETH market value was twice the MOUTAI, but 1/2 of it now. Even with this, ETH is able to climb 50% in 2 to 3 days.\n\nWORSE, the price fluctuations of large-scale assets such as BTC, Tencent, and MOUTAI generally have reasons to analyze from policy, business news, financial reports, etc. However, this is not the story for ETH. As long as there is a counterpart and there are profits for manipulators, even minors could suffer from liquidation (because the coins are still not mined, leverage exists). In other words, the combined powers of the whole market could not contend against the manipulator.\n\nTo make it more straightforward -- the game rule is simply: high control over the market, randomly, uninhibitedly.\n\nIn fact, BTC did not pass through ETF for the same reason. Nevertheless, since BTC gains its tokens from mining, the power of manipulators, if they exist, is lowered, making the combined market power surpass that of the manipulators. As a result, manipulators need to follow macroeconomic data and other indicators. With the BTC scale and market value growth, it is increasingly hard to be a manipulator. Manipulators can be or have already been, suppressed by the whole market. Thus, it is not hard to understand that BTC and Nasdaq gradually have similar trends. You can make money by analyzing the trend with low leverage. Many people make a lot in BTC contracts but lose everything in ETH -- with the same operation. For me, I have never seen someone earning with ETH contract in leverage. Why do these analyses not work for ETH? The candlestick chart for ETH does not reflect an effective market.\n\nLet's then take a look at ETH from pow to pos. Let me first briefly introduce the difference between pow and pos. Pow uses algorithm & computing power to allocate output, that is, the original mining. POS distributes output by mortgaging ETH itself as a node.\n\nYou can simply understand it as follows. If Ethereum is a company, then the ETH token is the stock, and the gas fee is the main income source. The company needs to continuously issue additional shares as rewards to those who contribute. But now, the company has made steady profits, and the gas fee has exceeded what is needed for operation maintenance. As a result, the company decided not to issue additional shares. The company will use the earned gas fee income to distribute gas according to the proportion of ETH mortgage as the node. The stock itself is equity, and gas is the right to operate and distribute dividends. Formerly, the dividends were distributed to employees (miners), and now to shareholders (people who hold eth mortgages as nodes).\n\nI think many analysts have talked about the advantages and disadvantages of POW and POS. Here, I will only discuss the impact on manipulators following my previous thoughts in the article. The POS mechanism will make the manipulator's original power stronger -- and eth more concentrated in the hands of those who have already owned a lot.\n\nWhat matters is the manipulator. Whether you double or halve the leverage, whether you long or short, or trade randomly -- YOU ARE ALL GIVING AWAY THE MONEY FROM YOUR POCKETS.\n\nIf we regard leveraging with unreliable contracts as a live bet, then the one with ETH is a gamble. Leveraging on ETH is like pushing yourself to the robber. It's not the case that you are not able to, or have not, win, but the situation that you cannot bring anything you win from the robber. I have observed several ETH trends and lost a lot. Following the same logic, I have earned hundreds and thousands more in BTC.\n\nI haven't understood why my model works on BTC but not on eth for years. IT IS REALLY WEIRD. But not until today did I realize the reason -- ETH started as IXO.\n\nDON’T F\\*\\*KING USE LEVERAGE!\n\nDON’T F\\*\\*KING USE LEVERAGE!\n\nDON’T F\\*\\*KING USE LEVERAGE!", "timestamp": 1658468299, "digest": "sZ8Uutf66RYLyi7OgSL82gzJfCivBVjmC0RvBvSHCKQ", "contributor": "0x11A248a30ceE6e14a6a43cDF08986e1dcfb6394c"}

According to the Web3 executive, the community should stick to its core values and stay determined to deliver real solutions. Kline explained that:\n\n> “We all go through the downturn together and we all come out of it stronger. We all support each other's projects, and there's a virtuous cycle there that continues to nurture the ecosystem.”\n\nThe Web3 executive also highlighted that the [crypto winter provides an opportunity](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-winter-presents-an-opportunity-amid-chaos-says-asset-group-exec) for builders. This is because there is less noise during the bear market, making it what Kline describes as a \"builder's paradise.\" Kline also said that:\n\n> “The community will hunker down and focus on building. Only the committed founders and community members stick around, and this ends up being a great filter. Some even welcome the bear market for this reason.”\n\nFollowing this, Kline underscored that there are still many things that need to be built in the space, mentioning layer 2s, multi-chain aggregation, bridge technology, custody and [decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)](https://cointelegraph.com/decentralized-automated-organizations-daos-guide-for-beginners/what-is-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work#:\\~:text=A%20decentralized%20autonomous%20organization%20(DAO,and%20managed%20by%20their%20members.) as some of the things that are on the way.\n\nApart from these, Kline also mentioned that [blockchain can affect social media](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-ceo-blockchain-can-make-social-media-interoperable-says). “As the social networks of web3 come to fruition, they will be a game changer,” said Kline. In addition to that, the executive also believes that [decentralized exchanges (DEXs)](https://cointelegraph.com/defi-101/what-are-decentralized-exchanges-and-how-do-dexs-work) will eventually surpass the volume of centralized exchanges.\n\n***Related: [Crypto winter survival guide: Community shares game plan for the bear market](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-winter-survival-guide-community-shares-game-plan-for-the-bear-market)***\n\nWhen asked what blockchain community members should keep in mind during the crypto winter, Kline said that some of the greatest companies and technologies were born out of recessions. The executive urged the community to keep building. Klined highlighted:\n\n> “Don’t wait around for the recovery to happen: keep building, focus on the core mission and remember that we are laying the foundation for the next recovery now.”\n\nLastly, the Web3 executive mentioned that the blockchain ecosystem can expect a wave of more resilient decentralized technologies to rise out of the crypto winter.

**区块链技术支柱——去中心化存储**\n\n计算、存储、网络是区块链技术的三大支柱，作为第二支柱的存储对于 Web3 世界发展具有重要意义。一方面，随着 Web3 世界的发展，数据存储需求呈爆发式增长，而区块链本身并不是为存储大量数据而设计的，如果在区块中存储数据非常昂贵，还会导致网络拥堵等一系列问题。**海量的数据存储需求使得去中心化存储有着巨大的商业前景，其重要性愈发凸显。**\n\n另一方面，目前很多 NFT 的底层元数据和 DApp 前端存储在链下，其中存储在链下中心化网络上数据面临诸多风险，正所谓“不是你的私钥，不是你的加密货币”，数据安全与数据主权问题亟待解决。**去中心化存储基于区块链分布式存储技术，将私人数据还给个人，让用户能够真正的拥有数据所有权，具备提供隐私性高、安全性强、定制化和经济激励模型等特点，满足了当下发展需求。**\n\nWeb3 的发展离不开存储的支持，去中心化存储乃是大势所趋。目前已有 Filecoin、Siacoin 和 Arweave 等区块链存储网络的尝试，但他们仅提供了连接用户和存储提供商的存储服务，无法实现区块链网络间信息的综合利用，远远未能充分激发去中心化存储的发展潜力。**为 Web3 时代提供一个完善的数据云存储技术方案，弥补去中心化云存储网络基础设施的空白，这正是去中心化存储方案 CESS 的愿景。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nkmFkwXZrbCWOeRPA0nfM.png?height=248&width=569)\n\n> **去中心化云存储 CESS**\n\n**CESS 致力于为 Web3 时代提供全球去中心化云数据存储网络。**CESS

数据的共享协议、多副本可恢复存储证明（PoDR²）和多类型数据确权机制（MDRC）等多重技术优势，为客户提供安全、高性能、无限的云数据存储服务。\n\n### 存储技术优势概览\n\n* **随机选取轮值共识节点（R²S）机制**：任何人可匿名且公平的机会加入 CESS 网络成为候选共识矿工，从而避免巨型节点的操纵，为所有矿工提供平等的机会。实现低 Gas 费用、快速交易处理吞吐和共识安全。\n\n\n* **多副本可恢复存储证明（PoDR²）机制**：在确保分布式场景下，解决当前存储系统的数据泄露、丢失问题，有效提升数据的安全性、可用性和完整性。\n\n\n* **多类型数据确权（MDRC）机制**：实现了对分布式的网络上不同形态多维数据存证确权，解决数据流转过程中数据存证和数据确权难问题。\n\n\n* **去中心化代理重加密机制**：让数据所有者在不泄露数据内容情况下，实现数据在去中心化条件下数据所有者之间自由交互。\n* **智能云空间管理（Smart Cloud Space）**：CESS 网络将全球节点空间“池化”，形成类似于“去中心化云存储池“，提供用户按需购买的云存储服务模式，CESS 在网络空间中设置调度服务将存储用户的数据智能分配到全球节点中，最大限度和有效利用存储空间——**智能云空间管理对全网资源和负荷进行统筹及调度协调，实现高可用性和高效率。**\n\n**感兴趣的开发者可以进一步阅读 CESS

{"id": "uMmUU4iknTIi3ORTyhUtsrksUmvbBNhDgQjX1V9ZKH8", "title": "30天30位心理学家——西格蒙德·弗洛伊德", "body": "我是弗洛伊德。我有很多身份，精神病医生、心理学家、精神分析创始人。在高中时，我甚至还想成为一名律师。听说现代心理学抛弃了我，说我不科学。（好吧。科学本来是个名词，现在竟然成了形容词。）就连这个博主，也只拿我当试播集。但是，我依然想说说我的故事。\n\n1856年，我出生在一个犹太家庭，父亲是一位商人，母亲是他的第三任妻子。我是母亲的第一个孩子，她宠爱我，我也爱她。在未来那些苦难的日子里，母亲一直都在给予我力量。4岁时，我和家人来到了维也纳，一个七十八年之后我才离开的地方，一个浮夸到令我厌倦的地方，一个塑造精神分析理论的地方。\n\n17岁那年，我受到歌德影响，迈向过自然科学大门，进入维也纳大学学医。在大学期间，我熟读费尔巴哈，崇拜达尔文，追随当时著名的生理学家布吕克，研究小龙虾的神经细胞。没错，就是你们想象的那种小龙虾。八年后，我顺利地成为了一名厨子取得了医学博士学位。这段神经研究的经历，不仅让我在当时学到了科研方法，更在遥远的21世纪，在脑科学方兴未艾的时代，让神经科学带领被实验心理学家排斥的精神分析理论，焕发新春。\n\n1882年，我生命的转折点。因为穷，我选择了离开生理实验室，成为了一名外科医生。大量的医学实践，为我日后开展精神分析提供了经验。4月的某一天，我遇见了她，一个一生为我付出的人。一见钟情。我主动和她接近，没事儿和她唠嗑，不是给她割草，就是给她朗诵诗歌，还总找机会给她暗送秋波。6月的某一天，她给我做了一个蛋糕，上面写着白云大妈雅正玛莎·波奈斯。6月17日，我们订婚，育有三儿三女。那一年，我接触到了西奥多，兴趣转向了神经病学，一个我为之付之一生的事业。\n\n3年后，我带着240美元的奖学金，来到了巴黎，见到了沙考。次年，我回到了维也纳。在一个没人上班的假日，我的诊所开张了。那一年，我30岁，前途渺茫，娶了她。随后的几年，在接触到了更多的精神病人和催眠疗法后，我开始思考一种在人类意识之外的强大力量——“潜意识”。\n\n1895年，我和我的好朋友布洛伊尔教授合著了《歇斯底里研究》。书里的第一个病例是一位妇人。在对她治疗的过程中，我发现治疗的效果受到医生和患者关系的影响。有一天，她突然抱住了我，很用力。那一刻，我开悟了——人的神经活动或许以性欲为基础。那一刻，预示着未来精神分析泛性论的命运，预示着未来布洛伊尔和我终将分道扬镳。\n\n1897年，在父亲去世后的一年，我开始了自我分析，持续终生。“他的死终结了他的一生，却唤起我早年的全部感受。”在记忆中，我对母亲有排他、独占的情感，甚至嫉妒父亲。这是人从小就有的“性动力”，即“俄狄浦斯情结”，是生命的原动力，会影响人随后的心理发展。\n\n在我最初关于人格的模型——解剖模型中，我把人格分为“意识” “前意识”和“潜意识”三种。“意识”就是说你当下想的东西，比如你看这个文章时，想到点个“在看”。但这只是储存在大脑中信息的一小部分。而可以通过回忆调集到“意识”层面的信息，构成了“前意识”。比如，这次你说了“下次一定”，下次看推文时想起了自己的承诺。意识和前意识只是冰山一角。在那之外，都是无意识。它虽然很难进入意识，但却决定了我们的许多行为。比如，算了，这个例子你们自己想，就和“关注”什么相关的就好。\n\n解剖模型容易让人对心理过程有静止的印象，不足以表明它的原动力性质。因此，我又提出了结构模型，即“本我（ID）、“自我（EGO）”和“超我（SUPER EGO）”。本我只和满足人的欲望有关，遵循快乐原则，它完全隐藏在无意识之中。自我以考虑现实的方式满足本我的要求，缓解本我需要未满足时的紧张，遵循现实原则。超我代表着社会价值观，与道德和良心有关。它不仅会惩罚违反道德的行为，更会为自我设立模范典型。\n\n本我、自我和超我常常发生内斗，而人的行为就是一系列内在冲突的结果。你的本我常常想立马满足冲动，但自我往往会给它一巴掌，问“你也配？”。在这些冲突中，性本能（也叫生的本能或力比多）和攻击本能（也叫死的本能或塔那托死）最有可能带来长远的影响。性本能不仅仅指向性，也包括所有与快乐有关的行为。死的本能很少表现为自残，更多是转向对他人的攻击行为。我觉得可能是因为自残比较疼。\n\n这些冲突往往在意识之外。但由冲突所带来的焦虑则可以进入意识。为了摆脱焦虑而做出的行为里，常常包含防御机制（defense mechanisms）。比如你在看文章后说“下次一定”，为了缓解这种错误行为带来的愧疚，你就可能想“大家都这样”。这就做“合理化（rationalization）”。对于一些痛苦的记忆，人们可能会选择性遗忘，也就是自己骗自己。这是“压抑（repression）”——防御机制中的旗舰款。自己骗自己的机制还有“投射（projection）”和“替代（displacement）”。“投射”就是把自己的想法赖到别人身上。比如明明是你自己半夜想吃宵夜，非说是你男朋友饿了。而“替代”呢，就是把情绪，特别是愤怒转移到别人身上。你在外面受了委屈，不敢反抗，只能向其他较弱的人下手。而发泄的对象，通常都是你的家人。因为其他人可能会削你。其他比较常见的防御机制有：反向形成(reaction formation）、退行（regression）和认同自居（identification）。“反向形成”就是表现出与真实想法相反的行为。某些批评男同的男性，可能就是害怕自己的男同倾向。当你因自我价值受损而夸张的自吹自擂，或者做出其他一些明显的幼稚行为，这就是“退行”。“认同自居”，则表现为通过加入某个团体，或者认识哪个大佬来提升自我价值感。防御机制中唯一成功的就是“升华（sublimation）”，在它的作用下，把危险的冲动转化为社会认可的行为，比如攻击本能在体育运动就至为重要。\n\n1899年，我人生最重要的成就——《弗公解梦》《梦的解析》出生了。在以后的岁月里，它不仅会影响无数心理学者，为诸多文学创造提供素材，甚至还浸染了司法审判。这是一本注定要在心理学，乃至人类历史上，留下浓墨一笔的书。在书的扉页上，写着“如果我不能震撼天堂，那么我将撼动地狱”。首次发行600册，花了八年时间卖完。\n\n1902年，一位读者找上门，他是一位医生，要求我对他进行精神分析（像这种要求我这辈子都没见过）。为了方便我分析他，我们约定每周三在我家见面。随后，我们成立“星期三心理学会”，一个最初只有两个人的组织。我任会长，他任副会长。后来，陆陆续续有人加入了我们。包括那两个让我又爱又恨的人——阿德勒和荣格。组织也改了名，叫“维也纳精神学会”。\n\n俗话说，5岁看老。1905年，我完成了性学三论，论述了幼儿性行为，性本能和性变态。儿童在五六岁前，会尝试处理他们强大的性冲动，也就是心理性欲阶段。每一个阶段的发展质量，都会对人格有强烈的影响。处理的好，在长大成人后会有健康的人格。但如果在某个阶段遇到问题，那么就会造成固着（fixation）。固着意味着发展停滞，也就是卡住了。第一个阶段是口唇期（0\\~1岁），这一阶段的关键是断奶方式，欲求焦点是用嘴吮吸和咬合。如果口唇期固着，长大后可能会贪吃，喜欢喝酒，喜欢抽烟（虽然我嗜烟如命，但我并不是口唇期人格。别问为什么，问就是老双标了）。第二个阶段是肛门期（2\\~3岁）。这一阶段儿童开始如厕训练。“肛门期人格”的人可能会比较固执，强调秩序感。第三个阶段是性器期（4\\~5岁）。这一阶段会出现所谓的恋父恋母，比如男孩的俄狄浦斯情结（这个或许可能大概是我）。在这个阶段，关键在于消除对异性家长的性渴望和对同性家长的敌意。接下来是潜伏期（6\\~12岁）。这一阶段的儿童进入了“圣人模式”。男孩只和男孩玩，女孩只和女孩玩。但随着青春期的到来，他们将进入生殖期，大家的性冲动转向异性。\n\n尽管在满是种族歧视和崇尚清教徒式生活的维也纳，我仍不为人们接受。但这个世界的其他地方，慢慢对我有了回应。1908年，在访问英国之后，我受邀去往美国。第二年，在去往美国的“华盛顿”号上，我看到船上一位工作人在看我的《日常生活的精神分析》。那时我就知道，我终将闻名于世。2年后，国际精神分析协会成立，“国际精神分析运动”开始。1911年到1913年，精神分析运动出现了两次大分裂，一次由阿德勒领导，一次由荣格领导。1911年，阿德勒离开了我。1912年，荣格写信给我说：『无论如何，你以对待病人的做法对待你的学生们，这都是极大的错误。……你维持高高在上的地位，使自己好像威风凛凛的父亲……尽管我有自己的见解，但我将继续公开支持你。』在后来的一次见面中，我们的分歧更大了，之后，他便退出了协会。想起了5年前我们的初次见面。那时，我深信他将永远支持我；那时，我以为他是我的“儿子和继承人”。\n\n1914年，一战爆发。战争，使我的一家都笼罩在阴影之下。60岁的我，仍然贫无立锥。风湿、口腔癌也渐渐找上我。虽然战争后需要精神分析的精神病患者更多了，但离我心中的那个梦还很遥远。\n\n1926年，病情恶化。那一年，我在德国，见到了爱因斯坦。4年后，我获得了歌德文学奖，母亲去世。沉痛的打击再一次成为了向前的力量。1933年，希特勒上台，说我的书是禁书，把我的心血付之一炬。如果在中世纪，他们烧死的就是我。83岁的那一年，法西斯来了。我带着家人离开了维也纳，去往英国。这一走，便是永别。\n\n1939年，我的下颚已经全部烂掉。我读的最后一本书，是巴尔扎克的《驴皮记》，讲的是饥饿。\n\n9月21日，我请求医生为我注射吗啡。他说好。9月23日，我便死了。\n\n时至今日，我仍然梦想着，精神分析会漫步到全世界的每个科学领域。", "timestamp": 1658475736, "digest": "PBcDGgEB9b9qc8m2wShvrChjPUR1H-YjbFl19ixD2iM", "contributor": "0xf54638AF93CD7e9a82b50e4d6A18158A2a9E501e"}

Many crypto and blockchain community members — us included! — have witnessed repeated ups and downs. Yet, we believe these moments of extreme market volatility represent the best opportunity to hunker down and build the infrastructure to onboard web3’s next billion users.\n\nToday, we are ready to announce that Sui’s Incentivized Testnet will kick off in August. This stage is the next step towards launching a secure, performant, and decentralized blockchain network.\n\nOur team has been hard at work since our initial announcement. We:\n\n* Finalized the design and implementation of [Sui Move](https://docs.sui.io/learn/sui-move-diffs?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=testannounce), an improvement on the original Move instantiation in Diem [optimized for ergonomic and highly parallelizable code](https://docs.sui.io/build/programming-with-objects?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=testannounce)\n* Open sourced [Narwhal/Tusk](https://github.com/MystenLabs/narwhal) consensus and integrated it with Sui to support shared object transactions\n* Released a public [DevNet](https://docs.sui.io/explore/devnet?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=testannounce) for early Sui builders and partners\n* Shipped the [Sui Explorer](https://explorer.devnet.sui.io/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=testannounce) that leverages Sui’s object-centric data model to display transactions and their effects in a human-readable fashion\n* Launched [fullnodes](https://docs.sui.io/build/fullnode?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=testannounce) to an enthusiastic response from our community, with more than 5,000 nodes running in 65 countries and 271 cities and counting!\n\nSpeaking of our Sui community, we would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for your engagement, thoughtfulness, and commitment.

Our community has repeatedly shown the value and importance of public feedback throughout the early phases of a major undertaking like Sui.\n\n# Sui Testnet Roadmap\n\nSui’s testnet will steadily progress from the first multi-entity Sui network toward a decentralized mainnet operated by an evolving set of independent and distributed validators. The testnet will gradually introduce and stress-test the key features, mechanisms required for a decentralized, production-ready Sui network.

You need to master areas such as investing psychology, history of money, basics of blockchain technology & cryptography. Understanding the main events of the most important crypto project during the last 10 years will be of much use as well.\n\nOne of the most difficult things for newbies entering the crypto space is finding the signal through the noise. That is, where to start learning, what are the best materials. The crypto space feels overwhelming and difficult to keep up even for the full-time professionals in the space.\n\nThere is absolutely a lot of garbage content (and outright scams) online. The top priority, if you’re serious and committed, is to identify what are the most legitimate sources to learn the fundamentals. And stick to these and avoid the rest. You need to get back to the basics. You actually need to get way back to history before you can understand the and future.\n\nWhen I started to learn the space full-time, it literally took me 2-3 months to identify what sources should I consume. Now I would like to share the best books I have identified.\n\nBased on my experience, books are absolutely the best way to build up your fundamental understanding in the shortest amount of time. There will be lot of “mind warp” moments. That is, you need to internalize many new mental models and concepts. It requires brain bandwidth. That is to say, don’t try to cram through these books. Read slowly and try to understand everything. Make notes. Avoid audio version. Read when you are at your full capacity (for me it’s the mornings or weekends).\n\nForget the crypto news, crypto twitter, and other day-to-day content. Get the fundamentals right. Read 1-2 of these books and you are already 90% ahead of everybody else. Read all of them and you’re 99% ahead.\n\n**Here are my Top-5 books to become a crypto investor:**\n\n1. Psychology of Money\n2. Bitcoin Standard\n3. Infinity Machine\n4. Layered Money\n5. The Price of Tomorrow\n6. Coingecko’s “How to DeFi”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gRrgCxAu8CctvSuzULNbH.png?height=545&width=378)\n\n**Psychology of Money (Morgan Housel)**\n\nThis is not a blockchain or crypto book, but it is pre-requisite learning before it is safe to enter the crypto markets.\n\nThis book talks about how you should think about your relationship with money and life. Money can literally screw people over. Some people neglect thinking about money in its entirety. Some people get so attached to money that they do whatever it takes to get more while neglecting everything else. Some people are good at making money but bad at staying wealthy. It’s all about behavior. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Also, financial behavior is difficult to model through successful friends, as you really cannot “see” their full thinking process or values behind the decisions. Financial literacy is more a soft skill than a hard skill, and it requires plenty of self-reflection.\n\nThis book is full of great universal truths about how to think about money. Investing is a lot about psychology. This book will help you to build a well-rounded foundation before you hit the markets. And you need that, as crypto markets can be 10x volatile than traditional stock markets.\n\nRead my [full review and best quotes of Psychology of Money](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3906761717?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1) on Goodreads.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/r_lHdjlP3nZfGu-j9_QYs.jpeg?height=1078&width=720)\n\n**Bitcoin Standard (Saifedean Ammous)**\n\nIn 2013, as a young computer science student, I studied the Bitcoin whitepaper with great fascination from a technical perspective. I thought Bitcoin was interesting, but I only understood a limited view of its potential.\n\nMany years later, I read the Bitcoin Standard book. It truly blew my mind. I cannot recall any other book that so dramatically shifted the way I understand how money, currency, and store of value assets work. It’s truly a fascinating topic, and it goes way deeper than one might initially think.\n\nEssentially, this book tells about the history of money. To understand Bitcoin, understanding the history of money is the best place to start learning. It is a bit counter-intuitive, but trust me. I regret that I didn’t read this when it came out because I thought that “I already know what Bitcoin is”. Maybe I did, but I couldn’t put it into the perspective.\n\nI argue, when you combine the understanding of the history of money with blockchain technology, you simply cannot unsee the transformation we are going through.\n\nSee my [full review of Bitcoin Standard](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3718907063) on Goodreads.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X2E3qIx2Ub7mjAuKt7IY2.jpeg?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Infinity Machine (Camila Russo)**\n\nAfter you understand Bitcoin and the history of money, the next logical step to understand is Ethereum.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum can be roughly split into two parts:\n\n1. How Ethereum works technically and\n2. Who created Ethereum and what was the chronological founding story.\n\nFor the first question, there are numerous technical videos you can find on YouTube. Watch a few of them.\n\nFor the second question, how The Infinity Machine is the best book. Camila Russo has interviewed all relevant people involved in creating Ethereum, and how it evolved throughout the years. It is a truly fascinating story, and covers many people who were active in the early days. Many of those people have important roles in the crypto space today. E.g. you might have heard of Polkadot and Cardano. Both are Top-10 crypto projects, and the founders of these projects were originally co-founders of Ethereum. There are many other people besides Vitalik Buterin.\n\nSee my [full review of The Infinity Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3823342460) on Goodreads.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A6izRrCXJ_3K9pfYF4V5x.jpeg?height=1040&width=650)\n\n**Layered Money (Nik Bhatia)**\n\nNow that you understand Bitcoin and Ethereum, it’s perhaps a good moment to step back a bit and look again at the big picture. Layered money tells the history of money and especially describes how the recent 100-year old financial system we have operates, and how it has evolved. It’s not a pretty story.\n\nThe book consists of fascinating visualizations of different ‘layers’ our financial system is based on. On top of the pyramid, there is the hardest asset. It used to be physical gold for a long time. In 1971 in the Nixon administration, the gold-peg was abolished. The highest layer changed. It wasn’t gold anymore, instead, it was US Treasuries. This changed the whole fundamentals of the system. Essentially, money printing started on a large scale.\n\nI have [written a Twitter thread summary](https://twitter.com/MikkoIkola/status/1419660307891376128?s=20) of the learning of this book. (I got a nice confidence boost as the book author Nik Bhatia himself retweeted this, yay)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BJxuIbOddMOLpvJxBpBKA.jpeg?height=1080&width=720)\n\n**The Price of Tomorrow (Jeff Booth)**\n\nThis book hammers down one fact: Why deflation is the key to an abundant future.\n\nIf you’ve taken the Economics 101 class in the university, you’ve learned how deflation is a bad thing. You’ve been most likely taught that 2% inflation is a good thing. I can understand if it is difficult to question this.\n\nThat said, I kindly suggest forgetting what you were taught at the Econ class and pick up this book. Jeff Booth shows you that we are indeed headed to the deflationary future, and it’s a good thing (at least for those who comprehend it) thanks to the incredible rapid advancement of technology during the last few decades.\n\nThe key thing to understand is that technology is intrinsically deflationary. Our financial system and its fundamentals were built in an era when labor and capital were almost directly linked. This era counted on growth and inflation. This era is over today, but we keep on pretending that the old financial system still works today.\n\nDuring the last 20-30 years, the speed of technological development has been extremely fast. Most successful companies of today are not successful because they have a huge headcount. Instead, they have software that scales around the world even with a relatively small headcount.\n\nThe only thing driving growth in the world today is easy credit, which is being created at a pace that is hard to comprehend — and with it, debt that we will never be able to pay back.\n\nSee [The Price of Tomorrow book on Goodreads.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50618463-the-price-of-tomorrow)\n\n**Coingecko** \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8UET5BkpQcjoEeEqNzbhB.png?height=2162&width=2206)\n\nAt last, we get to some pragmatic stuff you can put use immediately.\n\nI’ve left this as the last book in the list to emphasize how important it is to first learn the fundamentals. That is, the previous book in this list.\n\nHowever, if I’d start my learning path from zero, I’d perhaps read the other books and this book simultaneously. That is, consume this book not by only reading, but actually performing test transactions through most of the protocols mentioned here.\n\nGoingecko’s “How to DeFi - Beginner” is a hands on manual how to use the most important DeFi protocols. This list includes for example Maker (minting stable coin DAI), Aave and Compound (borrowing and lending protocols), Synthetix (synthetic assets), Decentralized insurance (Nexus protocol).\n\nThe screenshots in the book might seem fairly outdated. That is, because they are, heh. Don’t worry about it. The protocols are fundamentally still the same. And this discrepancy just signals how fast the space has evolved.\n\nGoingecko’s has also published advanced version of this book. It covers through other fundamental stuff, such as DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges), Yield aggregators, Oracles, Multi-chain bridges and so on.\n\nBoth books are the best consumed by actually using the protocols. So, be ready to invest few hundred bucks to ether and gas fees to get most out of it. Nothing replaces the understanding of actually using the protocols and exploring the first-source documentation they provide. Coingecko guides you to the most relevant protocols to start this exploration.\n\n[See Coingecko’s How to DeFi book website](https://landing.coingecko.com/how-to-defi/)\n\n**The learning path after reading these books**\n\nLearning crypto is like learning mathematics or a new language. It just doesn’t make sense to skip the basic arithmetics or basic grammar before entering the more advanced stuff.\n\nThat is to say, the best order to learn crypto is roughly this:\n\n1. History of money\n2. Blockchain technology\n3. Bitcoin\n4. Ethereum\n5. Basic DeFi protocols: Maker, Aave, Compound, etc\n6. NFTs, DAOs, other L1s and L2s, all the new cool stuff\n\nThe books I recommended in this blog post cover points from 1 to 5. Try to focus on understanding these well enough before you ape too much ahead.\n\nAfter you have built these fundamentals, the next step is to find the best sources online to follow. If you like to stay at the cutting edge, there won’t be many books, as the space evolves so fast. Instead, you need to find the best YouTube channels, podcasters, newsletters, and Discords to stay up-to-speed.\n\nIt took me a long time to find these channels, and I will compile a list of my favorite sources in the next blog post.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nIf you like my writing you can find more here: <https://mikkoikola.com/>", "timestamp": 1658476613, "digest": "GXMdJy5GdH0DTfN1niExCedOVic6pzN-MHqLMkdf6Bw", "contributor": "0x2b3DaEB14f069dB301cEAD63338a56d27A982CED"}

{"id": "xtEFSkKrXsld2ioIVqw6PxBhWImj5RB9wtdzwvhBpJw", "title": "Becoming a crypto investor: My top 6 books to learn the fundamentals", "body": "Becoming a successful crypto investor is a long path that requires plenty of learning.  You need to master areas such as investing psychology, the history of money, and basics of blockchain technology & cryptography. Understanding the main events of the most important crypto project during the last ten years will be of much use as well.\n\nOne of the most challenging things for newbies entering the crypto space is finding the signal through the noise. That is, where to start learning, and what are the best materials. The crypto space feels overwhelming and difficult to keep up even for the full-time professionals in the space.\n\nThere is absolutely a lot of garbage content (and outright scams) online. The top priority, if you’re serious and committed, is to identify the most legitimate sources to learn the fundamentals. And stick to these and avoid the rest. You need to get back to the basics. You actually need to get way back to history before you can understand the present and the future.\n\nWhen I started learning the space full-time, it literally took me 2-3 months to identify what sources I should consume. Now I would like to share the best books I have identified.\n\nBased on my experience, books are absolutely the best way to build up your fundamental understanding in the shortest amount of time. There will be a lot of “mind warp” moments. That is, you need to internalize many new mental models and concepts. It requires brain bandwidth. That is to say, don’t try to cram through these books. Read slowly and try to understand everything. Make notes. Avoid audio version. Read when you are at your full capacity (for me, it’s the mornings or weekends).\n\nForget the crypto news, crypto twitter, and other day-to-day content. Get the fundamentals right. Read 1-2 of these books, and you are already 90% ahead of everybody else. Read all of them, and you’re 99% ahead.\n\n**Here are my Top-5 books to become a crypto investor:**\n\n1. Psychology of Money\n2. Bitcoin Standard\n3. Infinity Machine\n4. Layered Money\n5. The Price of Tomorrow\n6. Coingecko’s “How to DeFi”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gRrgCxAu8CctvSuzULNbH.png?height=545&width=378)\n\n**Psychology of Money (Morgan Housel)**\n\nThis is not a blockchain or crypto book, but it is pre-requisite learning before it is safe to enter the crypto markets.\n\nThis book discusses how you should think about your relationship with money and life. Money can screw people over. Some people neglect thinking about money in its entirety. Some people get so attached to money that they do whatever it takes to get more while neglecting everything else. Some people are good at making money but bad at staying wealthy. It’s all about behaviour. And behaviour is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Also, financial behaviour is difficult to model through successful friends, as you really cannot “see” their full thinking process or values behind the decisions. Financial literacy is more a soft skill than a hard skill, requiring plenty of self-reflection.\n\nThis book is full of great universal truths about how to think about money. Investing is a lot about psychology. This book will help you to build a well-rounded foundation before you hit the markets. And you need that, as crypto markets can be 10x more volatile than traditional stock markets.\n\nRead my [full review and best quotes of Psychology of Money](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3906761717?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1) on Goodreads.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/r_lHdjlP3nZfGu-j9_QYs.jpeg?height=1078&width=720)\n\n**Bitcoin Standard (Saifedean Ammous)**\n\nIn 2013, as a young computer science student, I studied the Bitcoin whitepaper with great fascination from a technical perspective. I thought Bitcoin was interesting, but I only understood a limited view of its potential.\n\nMany years later, I read the Bitcoin Standard book. It truly blew my mind. I cannot recall any other book that so dramatically shifted how I understand how money, currency, and store of value assets work. It’s truly a fascinating topic, going way deeper than one might initially think.\n\nEssentially, this book tells about the history of money. To understand Bitcoin, understanding the history of money is the best place to start learning. It is a bit counter-intuitive, but trust me. I regret that I didn’t read this when it came out because I thought “I already know what Bitcoin is”. Maybe I did, but I couldn’t put it into perspective.\n\nI argue, that when you combine the understanding of the history of money with blockchain technology, you simply cannot unsee the transformation we are going through.\n\nSee my [full review of Bitcoin Standard](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3718907063) on Goodreads.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X2E3qIx2Ub7mjAuKt7IY2.jpeg?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Infinity Machine (Camila Russo)**\n\nAfter you understand Bitcoin and the history of money, the next logical step to understand is Ethereum.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum can be roughly split into two parts:\n\n1. How Ethereum works technically and\n2. Who created Ethereum, and what was the chronological founding story.\n\nFor the first question, you can find numerous technical videos on YouTube. Watch a few of them.\n\nFor the second question, how The Infinity Machine is the best book. Camila Russo has interviewed all relevant people involved in creating Ethereum and how it evolved throughout the years. It is a truly fascinating story, covering many active people in the early days. Many of those people have important roles in the crypto space today. E.g. you might have heard of Polkadot and Cardano. Both are Top-10 crypto projects, and the founders of these projects were originally co-founders of Ethereum. There are many other people besides Vitalik Buterin.\n\nSee my [full review of The Infinity Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3823342460) on Goodreads.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A6izRrCXJ_3K9pfYF4V5x.jpeg?height=1040&width=650)\n\n**Layered Money (Nik Bhatia)**\n\nNow that you understand Bitcoin and Ethereum, it’s perhaps a good moment to step back and look again at the big picture. Layered money tells the history of money and especially describes how the current 100-year old financial system we have operates and how it has evolved. It’s not a pretty story.\n\nThe book consists of fascinating visualizations of different ‘layers’ our financial system is based on. At the top of the pyramid, there is the hardest asset. It used to be physical gold for a long time. In 1971 in the Nixon administration, the gold peg was abolished. The highest layer changed. It wasn’t gold anymore. Instead, it was US Treasuries. This changed the whole fundamentals of the system. Essentially, money printing started on a large scale.\n\nI have [written a Twitter thread summary](https://twitter.com/MikkoIkola/status/1419660307891376128?s=20) of the learning of this book. (I got a nice confidence boost as the book author Nik Bhatia himself retweeted this, yay)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BJxuIbOddMOLpvJxBpBKA.jpeg?height=1080&width=720)\n\n**The Price of Tomorrow (Jeff Booth)**\n\nThis book hammers down one fact: Why deflation is the key to an abundant future.\n\nIf you’ve taken the Economics 101 class at the university, you’ve learned how deflation is bad. You’ve been most likely taught that 2% inflation is a good thing. I can understand if it is difficult to question this.\n\nThat said, I kindly suggest forgetting what you were taught in the Econ class and picking up this book. Jeff Booth shows you that we are indeed headed to the deflationary future, and it’s a good thing (at least for those who comprehend it), thanks to the incredible rapid advancement of technology during the last few decades.\n\nThe key thing to understand is that technology is intrinsically deflationary. Our financial system and its fundamentals were built in an era when labor and capital were almost directly linked. This era counted on growth and inflation. This era is over today, but we keep pretending that the old financial system still works.\n\nDuring the last 20-30 years, technological development has been extremely fast. Most successful companies today are not successful because they have a huge headcount. Instead, they have software that scales worldwide even with a relatively small headcount.\n\nThe only thing driving growth in the world today is easy credit, which is being created at a pace that is hard to comprehend — and with it, debt that we will never be able to pay back.\n\nSee [The Price of Tomorrow book on Goodreads.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50618463-the-price-of-tomorrow)\n\n**Coingecko** \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8UET5BkpQcjoEeEqNzbhB.png?height=2162&width=2206)\n\nAt last, we get to some pragmatic stuff you can put to use immediately.\n\nI’ve left this as the last book in the list to emphasize how important it is first to learn the fundamentals. That is, the previous books on this list.\n\nHowever, if I’d start my learning path from zero, I’d perhaps read the other books and this book simultaneously. That is, consume this book not by only reading, but also performing test transactions through most of the protocols mentioned in the book.\n\nGoingecko’s “How to DeFi - Beginner” is a hands-on manual how to use the most essential DeFi protocols. This list includes for example, Maker (minting stable coin DAI), Aave and Compound (borrowing and lending protocols), Synthetix (synthetic assets), and Nexus protocol (decentralized insurance)\n\nThe screenshots in the book might seem fairly outdated. That is, because they are, heh. Don’t worry about it. The protocols are fundamentally still the same. And this discrepancy just signals how fast space has evolved.\n\nGoingecko’s has also published an advanced version of this book. It covers other fundamental stuff, such as DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges), Yield aggregators, Oracles, Multi-chain bridges and so on.\n\nBoth books are the best consumed by actually using the protocols. So, be ready to invest a few hundred bucks to ether and gas fees to get the most out of it. Nothing replaces the understanding of actually using the protocols and exploring the first-source documentation they provide. Coingecko guides you to the most relevant protocols to start this exploration.\n\n[See Coingecko’s How to DeFi book website](https://landing.coingecko.com/how-to-defi/)\n\n**The learning path after reading these books**\n\nLearning crypto is like learning mathematics or a new language. It just doesn’t make sense to skip the basic arithmetics or basic grammar before entering the more advanced stuff.\n\nThat is to say, the best order to learn crypto is roughly this:\n\n1. History of money\n2. Blockchain technology\n3. Bitcoin\n4. Ethereum\n5. Basic DeFi protocols: Maker, Aave, Compound, etc\n6. NFTs, DAOs, other L1s and L2s, all the new cool stuff\n\nThe books I recommended in this blog post cover points from 1 to 5. Try to focus on understanding these well enough before you ape too much ahead.\n\nAfter you have built these fundamentals, the next step is finding the best online sources to follow. If you like to stay at the cutting edge, there won’t be many books, as the space evolves so fast. Instead, you need to find the best YouTube channels, podcasters, newsletters, and Discords to stay up-to-speed.\n\nIt took me a long time to find these channels, and I will compile a list of my favorite sources in the next blog post.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nIf you like my writing, you can find more here: <https://mikkoikola.com/>", "timestamp": 1658477607, "digest": "vQUYyyguKPNH6xwbtXaHgv9AfnIh3VwvDJGMabdhsVM", "contributor": "0x2b3DaEB14f069dB301cEAD63338a56d27A982CED"}
{"id": "zS37o6XQuubtk-I2Kd8rFT-wHqahblaNm7uPMv6_u_0", "title": "Gucci：从NFT领域进军元宇宙", "body": "几个迷你游戏、一个咖啡馆，以及一个会出售Gucci服装的虚拟商店，它们被用来装扮这款虚拟小镇游戏中的主角，这是Gucci在Roblox上推出的一个数字空间，颇有一种Web 2.0 模拟小镇的游戏风格。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cPcUm_MKTc7FQvZKqqqF9.jpg?height=645&width=1080)\n\n只不过这次是在Web 3.0 上的又一次尝试，出品方来自奢侈品牌传统标杆Gucci，它鼓励线上用户尝试这种领先于其它时尚品牌的风尚，也就是来自元宇宙里的新鲜事物。\n\n在与潮牌的联名中尝到了热度、声誉和利益的甜头后，奢侈品企业觉得元宇宙的领域也未尝不可一试。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Nlglg4uJdNV-qISRSJ-92.gif?height=621&width=600)\n\n疫情让奢侈品行业整体数据下滑，搭上元宇宙的风口才又得到了一些回血的机会，可是，元宇宙这个未知的风口领域究竟能让奢侈品牌收获什么好处？那就从商业分析与市场营销的角度来看看Gucci在元宇宙行业的单刀直入。 \n \n\n**Gucci在元宇宙里是如何布局的**\n\n**丨它的速度快到让同行都应接不暇了**\n\n2020年6月，Gucci携手Snapchat，以线上的模式，支持用户在线试穿品牌的产品，一方面节省用户的试错时间，一方面刺激用户的感官体验，以增加行业热度。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zyyUIbubobSndjBHvZe-A.jpg?height=767&width=1080)\n\n2021年3月，Gucci打造数字化球鞋Gucci Virtual 25，集试穿、分享、收藏、消费为一体，通过虚拟的体验感满足了年轻一代用户对新玩法的追求。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HozNMf6qG1Qzzpl_aMjRK.jpg?height=546&width=970)\n\n2021年6月，Gucci在百年庆典上推出了第一个NFT视频作品，《Gucci Aria》寓意着“在冬天的阴影过去之后，渴望绽放与生长”。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Pe11_cuhugpUf9cjJZibI.jpg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n2022年1月，Gucci与潮玩公司Superplastic联名推出概念性NFT，除了区块链上的艺术藏品收藏之外，持有者还能够拥有线下的实体潮玩；从线上到线下，为Gucci NFT的持有者打造了一个全方位的VIP席位。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E8kozYp5Ku64EMqyBG4-f.gif?height=585&width=1080)\n\n2022年6月，Gucci已提交5项NFT和元宇宙相关商标申请，涵盖NFT支持的媒体、加密经纪业务、交易所、市场服务、虚拟服装、车辆、房地产、时装秀和货币，并且其美国的线下门店有五家已经支持加密货币支付。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HoEA-R8iIGb5sa0QzaEpq.jpg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n**选择联名元宇宙是盲目抉择还是追求先机**\n\n**丨谁不想在电子钱包里拥有一双Gucci联名AJ1的虚拟球鞋**\n\n这就类似于奢侈品与潮牌联名的智慧营销，任何在社交平台上的前置宣传与火爆炒作都只是为了产品的声势与热卖提供保障，跨界联名对于奢侈品而言是一种低成本捷径，既能跟上潮流的风向标，又能够洞悉现今互联网上消费者的需求变化。\n\n那套用在NFT的领域也是一个万金油的模板。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TZJIxaotUfdMtBkSrFX-M.gif?height=211&width=498)\n\n因为这种虚拟的数字产品太多元了，几乎拥有无上限的表现形式，到后期也可以把虚拟的东西转换为实体再进行一波宣传。\n\n传统的、经典的奢侈元素印在最新最潮流的“玩具”上，总会给人一种富有创造力的感觉，合作的双方无论是谁，品牌价值都得到了一次升华。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DeRp3w3ZFfcYYA_D6kuWq.gif?height=220&width=220)\n\n持有这些NFT的客户还能在现实生活中收到一模一样的实体产品，可以称得上是现实宇宙与元宇宙中的双丰收。\n\nGucci才不会在意NFT的价值上升与否，因为本身的Cost就并不大，品牌在意的是如何提前在虚拟空间里占领足够大的版图份额，再去品尝这块蛋糕的风味。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CqQSeX10tUm8VAqlEgWK1.jpg?height=597&width=1080)\n\n**引领潮流的Gucci其实也在求变**\n\n**丨有太多不懂变通而湮灭的故事**\n\n大众消费品味在变迁，使得奢侈品牌已经无法主导潮流市场。因此，品牌们不断求变，往自己的身上贴上更多的标签，延展品牌的故事和内涵，往更广阔的领域合作业务。\n\n说得抽象一点，奢侈品牌的市场份额正在被潮牌、快时尚蚕食，如果不是单纯为了那个代表价值和地位的品牌Logo，谁甘愿支付几十倍的价格去买一件经典款T恤而不是选择造型越来越出彩的Stussy呢。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L7j9Mcg7edVE6P8ZzJ7op.gif?height=250&width=444)\n\nGucci必须走下神坛才能够保持品牌的价值，而走下神坛的方式就是不断地跨界联名。\n\nGucci的操作是否是盲目的，我无法定论。但相比于竞品们的动作，他显然是跑到了最前面。\n\n从2019年到现在：\n\nCoach、Prada都在快马加鞭地布局元宇宙；LV不仅制作了独立的NFT手游，还为英雄联盟打造虚拟皮肤；Burberry和Blankos Block Party联名推出限量版NFT作品，属于养成系，持有者可以购买、升级并出售它们。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bN_547QY6A2-BXCBu-fEQ.gif?height=320&width=320)\n\n巴黎世家也在为电子游戏堡垒之夜的角色设计概念型皮肤与游戏道具。\n\n不仅它们，更多的品牌虽然没有动静但不代表它们放弃了这个市场，这些不过都是暴风雨来临的前奏罢了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iPkf8nBBxzL1ve3_Xv1TT.png?height=581&width=1080)\n\n**联名元宇宙能为Gucci带来哪些价值**\n\n**丨率先探索未知领域是一种勇气也具备了洞察力**\n\n1\\.没有原材料，几乎不需要劳动力，虚拟奢侈品项目的利润都是可见得高，甚至于调整一款虚拟服饰的时间少到只需要几分钟，远比现实生活中的要快得多得多。\n\n2\\.元宇宙有无限可能性，想要创造的产品可以无限趋近于设计师的想法，可以忽略市场的限制、逻辑性，这在现实生活中还不能够做到，并且这些虚拟产品或多或少又能反向提供给现实诸多灵感，可以说是一个创意在虚拟与现实中两用。\n\n3\\.不仅Gucci，就连其它的奢侈品每年都存在产品大量的积压问题，对于奢侈品牌而言，销毁要好过于“清仓甩卖”的概念，后者会让品牌掉价与贬值，也会撼动自身的市场地位。但是元宇宙中的虚拟产品，不存在积压和打折的问题，现实的资源矛盾将刺激虚拟奢侈品的市场进入繁荣的阶段。同时，供求关系继续也可以在虚拟市场中达到平衡。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/76pLgf4sIcPCjcL8tw4cE.jpg?height=667&width=1000)\n\n**挑战与反思：Gucci的风险与机遇共存**\n\n**丨虚拟的世界也不能完全与现实背道而驰**\n\n虽然元宇宙充满了无限的可能性，诸多名人的加入也已经让NFT成为了一种新的身份象征，但这一领域对于Gucci等奢侈品牌来说依旧充满了挑战性。\n\n元宇宙技术的不成熟是目前面临的最大关卡，如何展示虚拟奢侈品，比如服饰、配饰、鞋子等等，这就需要借助到VR/AR的科技，众所周知，Meta正在全力攻克这一方面的技术。因此而言，Gucci在虚拟市场中的模式转变也不是一蹴而就的，未来仍需数年时间的摸索。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XTvVhQvSh2CSxrCltW6tX.gif?height=709&width=818)\n\n作为传统奢侈品牌里的领军旗帜，Gucci的品牌声誉始终还承载着一定的社会定位和价值，对比那些籍籍无名从零到一的NFT蓝筹来说，它有很多先机，在其庞大背景的促使下，持有者提前便拥有了尊贵的身份象征，这也是足够吸引更多年轻消费者的地方。\n\n但Gucci究竟能在虚拟宇宙的领域扩大多少版图，确实是一个潮流圈和元宇宙界都津津乐道的话题，对于作为看客的我们来说就只能慢慢观望了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X-5MZIvsor5f7ydh8cRkX.jpg?height=1125&width=2000)\n\n \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1658477526, "digest": "5Q9FoaZtjHMxpybppGHKtghOMqTO9W6u1lLp929Dt64", "contributor": "0x104f97392b6B7121B230D68C65697b9EcdeBc683"}
{"id": "2S3toMeFGLneY1OGE5trK_12wWpvCkox5tRxmRa6c_o", "title": "NFTWorld遇“黑天鹅”：如何解决Web2和Web3的割裂？", "body": "*撰文：Morty*\n\n7月21日，《我的世界》(Minecraft) 在使用指南的更新中，宣布禁止《我的世界》客户端和服务器应用程序集成区块链技术，并且不能用于创建与任何游戏内容相关的NFT，包括世界、皮肤、角色物品或其他模组。\n\n**受此波及最大的项目是NFT Worlds。**\n\nNFT Worlds是一个去中心化完全可定制的游戏平台，NFT Worlds NFT所有者都可以在其中为世界中的玩家或独家社区制作各类元宇宙游戏体验。为了达到每一个世界可定制化的需求，NFT Worlds选择使用《我的世界》作为底层基础设施，NFT所有者可以通过成熟的Minecraft客户端、WorldEdit、MCEdit程序等世界编辑软件为玩家们提供高自由度的元宇宙游戏体验。\n\n![66d2c0bb2f17fea0577bdb0d1080841.png](https://www.techflow520.com/storage/u/image/20220722/1658476620392022.png)\n\n关于NFT Worlds选择《我的世界》的原因，官方是如此描述的：「（团队）在《我的世界》开源生态系统中拥有着近十年的工作经验，我们看到了它的一切能力以及开源工具、模组等的广泛性，它非常适合为我们的去中心化元宇宙提供源动力。」\n\n**在消息公布之后，NFT Worlds 代币 WRLD 闪跌超60%，而 NFT Worlds 的核心资产 NFT 闪跌超过 80%**。\n\n![ba138ba4aa6e3d084fc4175264e50ff.png](https://www.techflow520.com/storage/u/image/20220722/1658476628232032.png)\n\n![a374feca3479f5fe9638cdf6fbb3ce4.png](https://www.techflow520.com/storage/u/image/20220722/1658476609936928.png)\n\n据《我的世界》开发团队在声明中的描述，禁止区块链技术和NFT技术的主要原因是「NFT 基于稀缺性和排斥性创建了数字所有权，这与 Minecraft 的创造性包容和共同游玩的价值观不符，而是创造了一个区别富人和穷人的场景。围绕 NFT 的投机定价和投资心态将注意力从玩游戏上转移开来，鼓励暴利，我们认为这与我们帮助玩家获得长期快乐的价值观不符。」\n\n《我的世界》拒绝区块链和NFT本质上的原因是价值观的不符，也存有对于NFT Worlds可能存在欺诈行为的忧虑——如果出现欺诈行为，《我的世界》本身的品牌价值也会受到影响。这是我们可以从其文本中可以强烈感受到的。\n\n当然我们也可以按照《我的世界》开发团队的所有表述一一反驳，但《我的世界》开发团队的态度所代表的大多数游戏玩家对于NFT和Web3游戏的刻板印象——NFT通过稀缺性创建了数字所有权，却也区别出了穷人和富人。\n\n这在NFT游戏发展史中是无可避免的，因为金融化是区块链最主要的应用，甚至区块链游戏之所以蓬勃发展，也与其高度的金融化有关。但这也会催生出许多关于庞氏金融的批评，不可持续是目前NFT游戏/GameFi最大的问题。\n\n本文的态度更倾向于使用发展的眼光去看待 NFT 游戏/ GameFi——我们还需要将以下三点做好，才能彻底扭转NFT游戏在游戏社区中的舆论。\n\n### **1、原创IP品牌和原创游戏内容**\n\n**没有原创内容是一个很大的问题**，就像NFT World所遭遇的困境，Web2世界经过多年发展，已经具备非常成熟的游戏体系和游戏产品。如果一个Web3游戏选择依附某一个Web2游戏，那必定会受制于该游戏。\n\n**而原创游戏，尤其是优质的原创游戏需要一个长久的开发制作周期**。对于刚刚才被资本/机构关注的Web3游戏来说，优质原创游戏的出现还为时尚早。不过值得一提的是，虽然原创优质游戏仍然是稀缺的，但是Web3优质的IP品牌已然出现，比如BAYC。而BAYC的创建者Yuga Labs，正野心勃勃地准备推出基于Otherside土地的元宇宙游戏，尽管效果不尽如人意。不过，本文的态度还是要多给予Web3项目一些时间——有些开发周期是无法用钱来缩短的。\n\n只有更多的原创IP以及原创的元宇宙/游戏设计工具被推出，整个Web3游戏的生态发展才会更健康。\n\n### **2、可玩性**\n\n可玩性在GameFi领域其实已经是一个老生常谈的话题，**大部分GameFi是没有可玩性的，包括在行业内久负盛名的一些GameFi项目，比如Axie Infinity、Raca等等**。游戏开发者往往会在游戏中添加一下博弈、策略的元素以弥补游戏在可玩性和深度上的不足。\n\n除了以上这些，我们注意到，很多游戏都开始了对于可玩性领域的探索，毕竟很多Web2游戏在可玩性层面都是很好的老师。Web3游戏的发展路径也会基于游戏开发的难易程度进行，遵循网页游戏——手游/Web2链改游戏——独立小型游戏——3A级游戏的路径。\n\n**NFT和游戏的可玩性也并不冲突。NFT代表着玩家对游戏的所有权，可玩性印证着玩家对游戏的兴趣程度**。\n\n### **3、游戏门槛**\n\n游戏门槛是我们最需要关注的一点——**真正的Web3游戏是不会为游戏设置过高的游玩门槛和玩家数量。**\n\n例如，在之前GameFi中最常见的设置NFT数量本质上就是在限制玩家的总体数量，以及一些游戏动辄几百美金几千美金的准入门槛，都是摧毁NFT游戏声誉的重要原因。\n\n### **这样的影响是两方面的：**\n\n**●一是鲸鱼对于游戏可摄取价值的能力，能力越大，游戏越不平衡**。这与Web2网游中氪金提升实力有着本质区别——Web2网游氪金是通过消费获得了在游戏中的可玩性，而在NFT游戏中鲸鱼通过自身在资金层面的优势，获得比其他散户玩家更高的金融价值。\n\n**●二是NFT数量的限制，即玩家数量是有限制的**，以及基于稀缺性NFT价值的炒作，引发游戏的玩家增量减少，最终导致游戏经济体系的崩塌。\n\n**一个经济体就像一只装着水的瓶子，鲸鱼靠着不断摇晃瓶口把水晃出来获利，而越来越高的瓶口会让玩家无法将自己的水装入瓶子，最终水会越来越少，直至没有**。珍惜瓶子里的水，保持增长，减少震荡的次数，就是持续发展的希望。如何消除这类影响，将会是未来Web3游戏开发者所需要解决的重要问题。\n\n***深潮 TechFlow 是由社区驱动的深度内容平台，致力于提供有价值的信息，有态度的思考。***\n\n> ***社区：***\n>\n> 公众号：深潮 TechFlow\n>\n> 订阅频道：<https://t.me/TechFlowDaily>\n>\n> 电报：<https://t.me/TechFlowPost>\n>\n> 推特：[@TechFlowPost](https://twitter.com/TechFlowPost)\n\n*进微信群添加助手微信：blocktheworld*\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1658477853, "digest": "9n2lBLrzFe6H8snYDp2f-F6W1UxwH9tLirc_6WZCaQM", "contributor": "0x0E58bB9795a9D0F065e3a8Cc2aed2A63D6977d8A"}

DAGG：GameFi 的 DAO 进化\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*Oy1Te-sqvzrYdwJr)\n\n我们的首席执行官 [Yves La Rose](https://eosnetwork.com/zh/%e5%85%b3%e4%ba%8e/#yves) 在《国际商业时报》上发表了一篇新文章，题为《[DAGG：GameFi 的 DAO 进化](https://twitter.com/EosNFoundation/status/1546848775150469120)》。 在这篇富有洞察力的[文章](https://www.ibtimes.com/daggs-dao-evolution-gamefi-3570099)中，Yves 解释了从 Web2 游戏公会到 DAO 再到 DAGG 的发展轨迹，以及 DAGG 将如何在推动区块链行业获得更大采用率方面发挥关键作用。\n\n《国际商业时报》上的这篇文章，可以视为Yves上周在纳斯达克发表的题为[《去中心化自主游戏公会对建立GameFi至关重要》](https://bit.ly/3cjHcdU)的文章的后续。去中心化自治游戏公会，或称[DAGG](https://twitter.com/BigBeardSamurai/status/1520270867275698176)， 是一种新颖的方法，它融合了去中心化自治组织 (DAO) 和游戏公会的双方优势发展而来。\n\n正如 Yves 在[最近的采访](https://youtu.be/8DajaWLwb-Q?t=936)中所说，GameFi 是 DeFi 和 NTF 之间不可避免的碰撞，这导致了去中心化金融的游戏化。在最近的这两篇文章和随附的[推文](https://twitter.com/BigBeardSamurai/status/1544454752989323265)中，关于「DAGG将改变GameFi并帮助数百万玩家获得有趣、有利可图和社会化的区块链游戏体验」这一论点，Yves提出了令人信服的理由。\n\n[https://twitter.com/EosNFoundation/status/1547616632570228745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1547616632570228745%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Feosnfoundation%2Fstatus%2F1547616632570228745image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07](https://twitter.com/EosNFoundation/status/1547616632570228745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1547616632570228745%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Feosnfoundation%2Fstatus%2F1547616632570228745image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07)\n\n凭借行业领先的高性能[技术](https://eosnetwork.com/zh/%e6%8a%80%e6%9c%af/)，以及比任何其他区块链社区[更受欢迎的区块链游戏](https://twitter.com/BigBeardSamurai/status/1521307041054265346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1521307041054265346%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Feosnetwork.com%2Fblog%2Feverything-eos-weekly-report-may-9th%2F)基础，EOS

{"id": "60Fam_gMpzR0PWdy5WjWgu_GPUXzg5-48zvY6aScdbw", "title": "Becoming a crypto investor: My top 6 books to learn the fundamentals", "body": "Becoming a successful crypto investor is a long path that requires plenty of learning.  You need to master areas such as investing psychology, the history of money, and the basics of blockchain technology & cryptography. Understanding the main events of the most important crypto project during the last ten years will also be of much use.\n\nOne of the most challenging things for newbies entering the crypto space is finding the signal through the noise. That is, where to start learning and what are the best materials. The crypto space feels overwhelming and difficult to keep up even for the full-time professionals in the space.\n\nThere is absolutely a lot of garbage content (and outright scams) online. If you’re serious and committed, the top priority is to identify the most legitimate sources to learn the fundamentals. And stick to these and avoid the rest. You need to get back to the basics. You need to get back to history before you can understand the present and future.\n\nWhen I started learning the space full-time, it literally took me 2-3 months to identify what sources I should consume. Now I would like to share the best books I have identified.\n\nBased on my experience, books are absolutely the best way to build up your fundamental understanding in the shortest amount of time. There will be a lot of “mind warp” moments. That is, you need to internalize many new mental models and concepts. It requires brain bandwidth. That is to say, don’t try to cram through these books. Read slowly and try to understand everything. Make notes. Avoid audio version. Read when you are at your full capacity (for me, it’s the mornings or weekends).\n\nForget the crypto news, crypto twitter, and other day-to-day content. Get the fundamentals right. Read 1-2 of these books, and you are already 90% ahead of everybody else. Read all of them, and you’re 99% ahead.\n\n**Here are my Top-6 books to become a crypto investor:**\n\n1. Psychology of Money\n2. Bitcoin Standard\n3. Infinity Machine\n4. Layered Money\n5. The Price of Tomorrow\n6. Coingecko’s “How to DeFi”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gRrgCxAu8CctvSuzULNbH.png?height=545&width=378)\n\n**Psychology of Money (Morgan Housel)**\n\nThis is not a blockchain or crypto book, but it is pre-requisite learning before it is safe to enter the crypto markets.\n\nThis book discusses how you should think about your relationship with money and life. Money can screw people over. Some people neglect thinking about money in its entirety. Some people get so attached to money that they do whatever it takes to get more while neglecting everything else. Some people are good at making money but bad at staying wealthy. It’s all about behaviour. And behaviour is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Also, financial behaviour is difficult to model through successful friends, as you really cannot “see” their full thinking process or values behind the decisions. Financial literacy is more a soft skill than a hard skill, requiring plenty of self-reflection.\n\nThis book is full of great universal truths about how to think about money. Investing is a lot about psychology. This book will help you to build a well-rounded foundation before you hit the markets. And you need that, as crypto markets can be 10x more volatile than traditional stock markets.\n\nRead my [full review and best quotes of Psychology of Money](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3906761717?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1) on Goodreads.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/r_lHdjlP3nZfGu-j9_QYs.jpeg?height=1078&width=720)\n\n**Bitcoin Standard (Saifedean Ammous)**\n\nIn 2013, as a young computer science student, I studied the Bitcoin whitepaper with great fascination from a technical perspective. I thought Bitcoin was interesting, but I only understood a limited view of its potential.\n\nMany years later, I read the Bitcoin Standard book. It truly blew my mind. I cannot recall any other book that so dramatically shifted how I understand how money, currency, and store of value assets work. It’s truly a fascinating topic, going way deeper than one might initially think.\n\nEssentially, this book tells about the history of money. To understand Bitcoin, understanding the history of money is the best place to start learning. It is a bit counter-intuitive, but trust me. I regret that I didn’t read this when it came out because I thought, “I already know what Bitcoin is”. Maybe I did, but I couldn’t put it into perspective.\n\nI argue that when you combine the understanding of the history of money with blockchain technology, you simply cannot unsee the transformation we are going through.\n\nSee my [full review of Bitcoin Standard](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3718907063) on Goodreads.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X2E3qIx2Ub7mjAuKt7IY2.jpeg?height=500&width=500)\n\n**Infinity Machine (Camila Russo)**\n\nAfter you understand Bitcoin and the history of money, the next logical step to understand is Ethereum.\n\nUnderstanding Ethereum can be roughly split into two parts:\n\n1. How Ethereum works technically and\n2. Who created Ethereum, and what was the chronological founding story.\n\nFor the first question, you can find numerous technical videos on YouTube. Watch a few of them.\n\nFor the second question, how The Infinity Machine is the best book. Camila Russo has interviewed all relevant people involved in creating Ethereum and how it evolved throughout the years. It is a truly fascinating story, covering many active people in the early days. Many of those people have important roles in the crypto space today. E.g. you might have heard of Polkadot and Cardano. Both are Top-10 crypto projects, and the founders of these projects were originally co-founders of Ethereum. There are many other people besides Vitalik Buterin.\n\nSee my [full review of The Infinity Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3823342460) on Goodreads.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A6izRrCXJ_3K9pfYF4V5x.jpeg?height=1040&width=650)\n\n**Layered Money (Nik Bhatia)**\n\nNow that you understand Bitcoin and Ethereum, it’s perhaps a good moment to step back and look again at the big picture. Layered money tells the history of money and especially describes how the current 100-year-old financial system we have operates and how it has evolved. It’s not a pretty story.\n\nThe book consists of fascinating visualizations of different ‘layers’ of our financial system is based on. At the top of the pyramid, there is the hardest asset. It used to be physical gold for a long time. In 1971 Nixon administration abolished the gold peg. The highest layer changed. It wasn’t gold anymore. Instead, it was US Treasuries. This changed the whole fundamentals of the system. Essentially, money printing started on a large scale.\n\nI have [written a Twitter thread summary](https://twitter.com/MikkoIkola/status/1419660307891376128?s=20) of the learning of this book. (I got a nice confidence boost as the book author Nik Bhatia himself retweeted this, yay)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BJxuIbOddMOLpvJxBpBKA.jpeg?height=1080&width=720)\n\n**The Price of Tomorrow (Jeff Booth)**\n\nThis book hammers down one fact: Why deflation is the key to an abundant future.\n\nIf you’ve taken the Economics 101 class at the university, you’ve learned how deflation is bad. You’ve been most likely taught that 2% inflation is a good thing. I can understand if it is difficult to question this.\n\nThat said, I kindly suggest forgetting what you were taught in the Econ class and picking up this book. Jeff Booth shows you that we are indeed headed to the deflationary future, and it’s a good thing (at least for those who comprehend it), thanks to the incredible rapid advancement of technology during the last few decades.\n\nThe key thing to understand is that technology is intrinsically deflationary. Our financial system and its fundamentals were built in an era when labor and capital were almost directly linked. This era counted on growth and inflation. This era is over today, but we keep pretending that the old financial system still works.\n\nTechnological development has been extremely fast for the last 20-30 years. Most successful companies today are not successful because they have a huge headcount. Instead, they have software that scales worldwide even with a relatively small headcount.\n\nThe only thing driving growth in the world today is easy credit, which is being created at a pace that is hard to comprehend — and with it, debt that we will never be able to pay back.\n\nSee [The Price of Tomorrow book on Goodreads.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50618463-the-price-of-tomorrow)\n\n**Coingecko - “How to DeFi”**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8UET5BkpQcjoEeEqNzbhB.png?height=2162&width=2206)\n\nAt last, we get to some pragmatic stuff you can put to use immediately.\n\nI’ve left this as the last book on the list to emphasize how important it is to learn the fundamentals first. That is, the previous books on this list.\n\nHowever, if I’d start my learning path from zero, I’d perhaps read the other books and this book simultaneously. That is, consume this book not by only reading but also by performing test transactions through most of the protocols mentioned in the book.\n\nGoingecko’s “How to DeFi - Beginner” is a hands-on manual on using the essential DeFi protocols. This list includes for example, Maker (minting stable coin DAI), Aave and Compound (borrowing and lending protocols), Synthetix (synthetic assets), and Nexus protocol (decentralized insurance)\n\nThe screenshots in the book might seem fairly outdated. That is, because they are, heh. Don’t worry about it. The protocols are fundamentally still the same. And this discrepancy just signals how fast space has evolved.\n\nGoingecko has also published an advanced version of this book. It covers other fundamental stuff, such as DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges), Yield aggregators, Oracles, Multi-chain bridges, etc.\n\nBoth books are the best consumed by actually using the protocols. So, be ready to invest a few hundred bucks to ether and gas fees to get the most out of it. Nothing replaces the understanding of actually using the protocols and exploring the first-source documentation they provide. Coingecko guides you to the most relevant protocols to start this exploration.\n\n[See Coingecko’s How to DeFi book website](https://landing.coingecko.com/how-to-defi/)\n\n**The learning path after reading these books**\n\nLearning crypto is like learning mathematics or a new language. It just doesn’t make sense to skip the basic arithmetics or basic grammar before entering the more advanced stuff.\n\nThat is to say, the best order to learn crypto is roughly this:\n\n1. History of money\n2. Blockchain technology\n3. Bitcoin\n4. Ethereum\n5. Basic DeFi protocols: Maker, Aave, Compound, etc\n6. NFTs, DAOs, other L1s and L2s, all the new cool stuff\n\nThe books I recommended in this blog post cover points from 1 to 5. Try to focus on understanding these well enough before you ape too much ahead.\n\nAfter you have built these fundamentals, the next step is finding the best online sources to follow. If you like to stay at the cutting edge, there won’t be many books, as the space evolves so fast. Instead, you need to find the best YouTube channels, podcasters, newsletters, and Discords to stay up-to-speed.\n\nIt took me a long time to find these channels, and I will compile a list of my favorite sources in the next blog post.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nIf you like my writing, you can find more here: <https://mikkoikola.com/>", "timestamp": 1658478592, "digest": "VVAEitLMzhv2em8qNi9-g_0Qn6WB2YM-8ju12c8dy5A", "contributor": "0x2b3DaEB14f069dB301cEAD63338a56d27A982CED"}

PolkaIDO用戶現在將在“先到先得”的基礎上被選為投資者，而不是在一輪結束時（在表達興趣之後）被隨機選為投資者。\n2. 為了使一輪被視為成功（IDO 通過），必須達到50%的總閾值。一旦IDO超過50%的門檻，在它獲得全額資助之前，任何為其做出貢獻的人都將成為投資者。\n\n有關這些更改原因的更多信息，請[訪問官方 Polkadex Discord 服務器](https://discord.com/invite/Uvua83QAzk)或參與我們的現場 AMA 討論。總有空間容納額外的聲音！\n\n# 訂單簿\n\nPolkadex Orderbook是Polkadex生態系統中的旗艦產品。作為支持非託管高頻交易的第2層可信執行環境（TEE），Polkadex訂單簿不同於任何現有的去中心化交易所。\n\n## 測試網\n\n訂單簿發布的第一階段是由最近在公共測試網上推出的Polkadex Orderbook作為新的[Polkadex Open Beta](https://orderbook-beta.polkadex.trade/login)的一部分啟動的。此版本的Polkadex訂單簿連接到Polkadex測試區塊鏈，並具有測試代幣存款、市場和限價訂單交易功能。作為測試網版本的更新，提款將很快上線。如果您還沒有開始測試，請查看下面的文章以獲取有關如何開始測試的指南。\n\n[https://polkadex.medium.com/polkadex-orderbook-is-now-available-on-the-public-open-beta-979579c03567](https://polkadex.medium.com/polkadex-orderbook-is-now-available-on-the-public-open-beta-979579c03567)\n\n一旦您熟悉了Polkadex訂單簿，您就可以通過[在 Polkadex Open Beta Github 存儲庫上提出問題和分享您的反饋來獲得 PDEX](https://github.com/Polkadex-Substrate/Polkadex-Open-Beta)！\n\n## 主網發布 — 訂單簿 1.0\n\n按照計劃，Polkadex 訂單簿1.0將於2022年第三季度與PolkaIDO一起推出到Polkadex主網上。Polkadex訂單簿的第一個版本將包括進出第1層Polkadex網絡的取款和存款，並將包含一個ERC20交易對： PDEX/USDT或USDC (TBD)。具有領先Web3漏洞賞金平台的漏洞賞金計劃將與此版本同時運行。隨著漏洞賞金的進行，Polkadex訂單簿1.0期間的交易量也將受到限制。交易機器人集成支持應該會在最初的1.0版本發布後不久上線。\n\n## 訂單簿2.0\n\nPolkadex Orderbook 2.0將在2022年Q4漏洞賞金計劃之後推出，主要包含漏洞修復和基於漏洞賞金反饋的功能修改。該版本還將支持流動性挖礦計劃，該計劃將獎勵為交易所提供流動性的用戶。\n\n有關下一版Polkadex訂單簿和用戶入職策略的更多詳細信息將在2022年第三季度末分享。\n\n# 漏洞賞金計劃詳情\n\n漏洞賞金計劃旨在保護整個Polkadex生態系統及其所有產品免受攻擊。通過與行業領先的漏洞賞金計劃平台合作，Polkade 將鼓勵黑客在Polkadex代碼庫中發現任何潛在的裂縫或漏洞。參與的黑客將破解Polkadex以幫助使其更加安全，並將因此獲得報酬。來自Polkadex國庫的約$200萬PDEX將專門用於該計劃。\n\n考慮下這個能帶來什麼？請繼續關注有關錯誤賞金計劃的更多詳細信息！\n\n# 平行鏈首次運行用戶體驗策略\n\n在全球Polkadexers的幫助下，Polkadex贏得了第16個平行鏈插槽，他們貢獻了近100萬個 DOT，使Polkadex Crowdloan成為Polkadot平行鏈拍賣第3批中最大的眾貸。Polkadex平行鏈於6月4 作為一個單獨的基於Substrate的網絡上線。在悄悄地生產區塊一段時間後，平行鏈將在Orderbook主網上線後公開。所有DOT借貸參與者都可以期待在此之後分配眾籌獎勵。平行鏈上市後大約一個月左右，剩餘的PDEX供應量的一半將遷移到平行鏈。Polkadex 平行鏈將開始與其他鏈開放連接，從而允許資產從其他平行鏈無縫傳遞到Polkadex並返回，並提高Polkadex生態系統的互操作性。\n\n平行鏈首次運行用戶體驗的時間順序：\n\n1. 訂單簿主網啟動\n2. 平行鏈獎勵分配\n3. 平行鏈----[HRMP通道](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain#xcmp-lite-hrmp)與其他平行鏈。\n\n# THEA\n\n[如果沒有THEA， Polkadex](https://github.com/Polkadex-Substrate/polkadex-docs/blob/master/docs/doc3-theaBridge.md)的互操作層是不完整的， THEA是一種革命性的去中心化橋接協議，明確為Polkadex構建，以確保資產從其他區塊鏈生態系統順利存入Polkadex。THEA是實現 Polkadex 作為能夠進行高頻交易的非託管**跨鏈交易中心的長期願景不可或缺的一部分。**\n\n> *由於以下原因，以太坊的THEA協議的主網發布已移至2022年12月：*\n\n以太坊正在從工作量證明轉向權益證明。“[難度炸彈](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/22/ethereums-gray-glacier-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-difficulty-bomb/)”將於2022年10月為礦工引爆。難度炸彈是與以太坊 2.0 合併的重要一步，一旦引爆，它旨在通過證明來激勵向權益證明的轉變——在以太坊上進行工作挖礦幾乎是不可能的。新的Thea light客戶端需要重新調整以適應以太坊 2.0 的升級。這段時間也將用於優化THEA當前每日分佈式簽名機制的數據消耗（現在每個驗證者為10GB），以使其在驗證者端高效。\n\n同時，為避免更改任何產品發佈時間表，Chainsafe的EVM-to-Substrate兼容的跨鏈通信協議[Chainbridge](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge)將作為Polkadexers的替代方案。Chainbridge已經部署到其他基於Substrate 的項目，如[Moonbeam](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/integrations/bridges/chainbridge/)和[Khala](https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/Phala-Network/khala-chainbridge)，當Polkadex Orderbook和PolkaIDO進入Polkadex主網時，它將作為以太坊到Polkadex（和返回）的橋上線。\n\n一旦THEA發布，對Chainbridge的支持將被逐步取消。Chainbridge選項確 Polkadex Orderbook、PolkaIDO和Parachai的發布及時推出。\n\n## THEA1.0、2.0及更高版本\n\n目前計劃於2022年第四季度/2023年第一季度發布的THEA 1.0將支持從以太坊到Polkadex和返回的ETH和USDT存款和取款。2.0版將包括對更多ERC-20代幣的橋接支持。在THEA 2.0推出後，Polkadex社區成員將能夠通過社區治理請求將額外的ERC-20代幣列入白名單並獲得批准。\n\n從長遠來看，THEA將增加對除以太坊之外的其他第1層網絡的支持；因此，為以太坊以外的網絡提供去信任的流動性橋樑，並在Polkadex上實現跨鏈活動。\n\n> ***未來更新 \n ****請繼續關注更多更新和詳細信息，因為它們將繼續推出。我們正在接近我們的協議開發階段，並在Polkadex訂單簿的應用程序方面進入一個令人興奮的新階段。隨著我們從協議開發轉向全面以應用程序為中心的增長，預計明年將為我們的交易社區發佈出色的產品、專業工具和增值服務。*\n\n# 關於Polkadex\n\nPolkadex是一個完全去中心化、點對點、基於訂單簿的加密貨幣交易所，適用於基於 Substrate 的 DeFi 生態系統，旨在成為Web3的終極交易引擎。為了做到這一點，Polkadex 正在創建一個易於使用的平台，將中心化和去中心化交易所的優勢結合到一個迎合所有加密交易者的尖端解決方案中。\n\n[Website](https://www.polkadex.trade/)|[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/polkadex) |[ TG Chat](https://t.me/Polkadex) |[ TG Announcements](https://t.me/PolkadexAnnouncements) |[ Medium](https://polkadex.medium.com/) |[ Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fXRDT4lLKlXG3gP0PP06Q) |[ Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/polkadex/) |[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Uvua83QAzk) |[ Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/69690544/admin/) |[ Spanish community](https://t.me/Polkadex_Spanish) |[Turkish community](https://t.me/Polkadex_Turkish) |[ Indian community](https://t.me/polkadexindia) |[ Russian community](https://t.me/PolkadexRussian) |[ Chinese community](https://t.me/PolkadexCN) |[ German community](https://t.me/PolkadexGerman)\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1658478324, "digest": "6UAGb66wgha4Qt7Hf3iPdRhteTACkfo9dapCojjhc5A", "contributor": "0x005c0d08AF6B0C4b486916A7bd1F64b6fBaBB8D1"}

After several months of closed development, we’re thrilled to publish a **Genesis Report** on the milestones TARS has achieved so far. [TARS](https://tars.pro/) aims to provide a simple, safe, and collaborative infrastructure for crypto users to rebuild influence and trust on Web3. Here is a summary of all that’s happened on TARS.\n\n# Meet TARS\n\n[TARS](https://tars.pro/) **is an automated division of powers protocol for building the Credit Data Network in Decentralized Society (DeSoc).** Built on Non-Custodial, Secure & Audited Smart Contracts, TARS provides a simple, safe, and collaborative infrastructure for crypto users to rebuild influence and trust on Web3.\n\nA variety of Web3 utilities built with TARS Protocol, including TARS Space, Smart SAFT, Claimer, TARS Dashboard, etc., will allow crypto users to effortlessly engage in Web3 token economies and manage their portfolios in a trustable environment. Anyone can create their dedicated Web3 Brand through TARS Space and monetize their influence from it. Contributors to building the Credit Data Network will be rewarded **NTT (short for Non-TradableToken)** as proof of their credit.\n\n## What Inspired Us To Build TARS?​\n\n### 1. In the primary market investment of crypto, there is a centralization risk that cannot be ignored.\n\nPeople in the crypto world participate in the primary market mostly by directly signing a legal contract known as a ***Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT)*** with the project parties, or by purchasing tokens through pool financing or IDO. At the same time, the crypto project party implements the token vesting timeline according to their original tokenomics; nevertheless, it is common for certain project teams to adjust or change it, citing market circumstances or other reasons as justifications. The project team has the freedom to abandon the project, flee, or change the token vesting timeline without suffering any cost or limitation, destroying public trust in the project and endangering investor interests. Thus, TARS Protocol offers a secure, accessible, transparent, and decentralized tool for creating and participating in SAFTs and early-stage investment deals for anyone to use; and an easy-to-navigate platform with many features.\n\n### 2. The on-chain program’s complexity is preventing the widespread adoption of Web3 applications.\n\nDeFi has had a significant impact on the development of token economies in the past. However, most people’s participation in DeFi activities is still limited by certain thresholds and restrictions. Web3 solutions that are user-friendly and plug-and-play are the next step in DeFi advancement, according to us. A superb Web3 product should be easy to use and respond to users’ demands to the fullest extent possible. TARS Protocol is dedicated to making sophisticated Web3 apps easier to understand. Users can design and adopt Web3 utilities at the lowest cost with just a few simple clicks and no coding required. To regain trust and influence, the crypto industry requires a unified and simple decentralization standard. At TARS, anyone can launch the **Web3 DAO Hub** — TARS Space, calling various Web3 applications without programming, eliminating the need for complicated procedures.\n\n### 3. The construction of Decentralized Society (DeSoc) relies on the Credit Data Network in the future.\n\nOn May 10, 2022, Glen Weyl, Puja Ahluwalia Ohlhaver, and Vitalik Buterin co-authored and published a paper titled ***“Decentralized Society: Finding Web 3’s Soul”,*** and pointed out that “Web3 today centers around expressing transferable, financialized assets, rather than encoding social relationships of trust. Yet many core economic activities — such as uncollateralized lending and building personal brands — are built on persistent, non-transferable relationships”. We believe that the Credit Data Network will be one of the infrastructures for building Decentralized Society (DeSoc). The DEXs such as Uniswap and Pancakeswap meet the needs of people to invest and trade in the secondary market in a trustable and decentralized environment. However, the current primary market in crypto is still blank. As a result, TARS will set out to provide an alternative solution for the crypto industry — the division of powers protocol. It applies to the primary market’s investment environment, fully safeguards investors, and creates the credit data network that will power DeSoc. TARS NFT Receipt is adopted to record the deal/investment of the participants and supported to be swapped into    **Non-TradableToken (NTT)** as the credit cornerstone.\n\n## TARS Solution\n\nTARS aims to provide a simple, safe, and collaborative infrastructure for users to rebuild influence and trust on Web3. At TARS, the following three phases will be passed to build the Credit Data Network:\n\n### Phase 1: Basic Data Construction\n\nTARS expands the market and accumulates original investment behavior data by providing users with a series of Web3 applications for primary market scenarios, including TARS Space, Smart SAFT, Claimer, TARS Dashboard, etc.\n\n### Phase 2: TARS SocialFi Network\n\nBased on the first phase, TARS will introduce diversified SocialFi elements and features and merge Web2 socials to support users to build branded Spaces and improve the Credit System on Web3.\n\n### Phase 3: Credit Application Adoption\n\nThe construction of the TARS ecosystem is based on the complete Credit Data Network, and more ecological applications are developed and adopted, such as insurance, uncollateralized lending and building personal brands, etc. End-users will be rewarded with NTT (short for Non-TradableToken), which will be used in TARS’ Credit Application Modules, in exchange for their contributions to the TARS ecosystem.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*twRw-TeFi-95Rmdjh9SDMQ.jpeg)\n\n## How TARS Works\n\n### Division of Powers\n\nThe design of TARS introduces the idea of ​​division of powers, similar to the ***separation of powers*** in political terms. As we know, separation of powers refers to the division of a state’s government into branches, each with separate, independent powers and responsibilities, so that the powers of one branch are not in conflict with those of the other branches. The intention behind a system of separated powers is to prevent the concentration of power by providing for checks and balances.\n\nWe believe that in the world of Web 3, **code is law**. Therefore, in the TARS product Operation Mechanism, the division of powers is adopted to effectively balance and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of all parties involved.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6sHoGf8enlkRBt8hJaGUy.jpeg?height=887&width=1400)\n\nTaking the Smart SAFT as an example, although the proposer has the same interests as the investor, it has no right to touch the investor’s funds; the Token Provider can not complete the deal until it has successfully fulfilled its transfer obligations; investors can claim refunds when the deal failed and are no longer passive and vulnerable. The following flowchart provides a clearer picture of the checks and balances between the participants in the Smart SAFT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FfHpUHOoESNPRtLOrD4XW.jpg?height=975&width=1280)\n\n## Build With TARS\n\nTARS provides a simple, safe, and collaborative infrastructure for crypto users to rebuild influence and trust on Web3. A variety of Web3 utilities can be built with TARS Protocol, such as:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*-Gt6fwmzCCBq6kw8oaY9mA.jpeg)\n\n## Our Vision\n\nIt’s time to solve the **“trust problem”** when investing and trading in the crypto world.\n\nAt TARS, we are building a simple, safe, and collaborative infrastructure on Web3. Based on the business model of division of powers, TARS implemented the decoupling of all participant permissions and ensures that the business is completed in a trustable system. The Credit Data Network will be built through the mass adoption of TARS to power the Decentralized Society (DeSoc).\n\n## What We’ve Done So Far\n\n### The main milestones of the roadmap are as follows:\n\n> ***In Q1 2022***\n\n* The core team was built.\n* Did Idea Analysis & Initiation\n* Made the market fit research and the development plan.\n* Design & Technical Specifications Initiation\n* Legal Counsel\n* UI/UX Design and Tech Architecture Documentation\n* Build the First Version of the Development Framework\n\n> ***In Q2 2022***\n\n* Completed the BSC-based Space contract test.\n* Completed the Smart SAFT contract test.\n* Completed the NFT Receipt contract test.\n* Optimized the Interaction of Dashboard\n* Released of the Whitepaper 1.0\n* TARS V1 is ready to officially launch\n\nAs a decentralized ecosystem built for [#Web3](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hashtag_click&utm_campaign=Newsletter%20from%20TARS%20%F0%9F%AA%90&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), the protocol’s security is our top priority as always.

将要求提供激活码。STEPN 激活码可以在[STEPN Discord 服务器](https://discord.com/invite/stepn)、STEPN [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StepN/)和许多其他加密论坛上找到。\n\n![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61fdc688c14c2d02be89c30e/62d05fccd87982ecee3fdcd7_gD5SabwDogY1qqDb6LtWVVDUgrXVoad-AYzDwoRyDP2rPubrufnaji7JDkLDlkZq2xZGws5wPvu50V2RoikxKKatFT2NSN_JIqxueQLNsCmLeI-AhCAEZahIqjbk2i43nS_Oibjj9SBqmPV3MD8.png)\n\n3\\.**创建STEPN钱包**\n\n完成注册和激活码流程后，您将登陆应用主页。你的手机屏幕右上角会有一个钱包图标。点击它。您现在将看到两个选项卡：支出和钱包。点击钱包。点击钱包后，将出现一个弹出窗口。种子短语可用于创建新钱包或导入现有钱包。\n\n让我们在应用程序中“创建一个新钱包”。点击“创建新钱包”。然后 STEPN 将要求您创建一个密码，您将需要该密码来锁定/解锁您的钱包。然后，您将看到一个种子短语。除了以数字方式存储它之外，还要以物理方式存储它。任何知道您的助记词的人都可以访问您的 STEPN

中赚钱，您必须购买与您的健身水平相匹配的NFT Sneaker。\n\n有几个选项可用：\n\n沃克（1-6 公里/小时）\n慢跑者（4-10 公里/小时）\n跑步者（8-20 公里/小时）\n教练员（1-20公里/小时）\n有一个应用内市场，您可以在其中购买 NFT 运动鞋。除了运动鞋，您还可以购买鞋盒。鞋盒中随机有一只 Sneaker。在撰写本文时，运动鞋的底价在 2.14 美元至 2.55 美元之间（约合 78 美元至 93 美元）。\n\n![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61fdc688c14c2d02be89c30e/62d05fcdbfcdbe846c5e7764_-1bvHRTh8eHhVKlQIGCswGORI4Np6BREYE9sKpbyZAlwCx7DgUIuyW6aS_WSZuqHHmXo4knsr6DOfpdy5XIdadUydtYXF_NCZXTSRh4lL4Hlf1PJlEf4T0xnRUhEija1nsRSNxG1yM_GF3qrCw4.jpeg)\n\n总的来说，目前您需要大约 2-3 $SOL 才能开始使用 STEPN。除了 Sneaker 价格外，请确保有少量 $SOL 可用于支付 gas 费用。每款运动鞋的 $GST 回报各不相同。\n\n[NFT Sneaker 页面](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/game-fi-elements/sneakers)包含所有详细信息，包括：\n\n* **品质**：普通、罕见、稀有、史诗、传奇\n* **效率**：提高 GST 代币收益\n* **幸运**：提高神秘盒子的掉落率\n* **舒适**：增强[GMT 代](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gomining-token/)币收益（30 级）\n*

NFT 运动鞋后，在户外跑步、步行或慢跑时使用 GPS。如果您的 GPS 信号强，您将获得保证收入。低 GPS 信号或无信号将导致低至无增益。该应用程序旨在检测和忽略非有机运动（即，使用电动滑板车或将手机绑在狗身上）。此外，您必须根据您选择的运动鞋保持最佳速度。\n\n1. 烧掉 $GST/$GMT\n\n在 STEPN 中，燃烧 $GST 意味着花费它。\n\n您可以通过赚取的 $GST/$GMT 升级您的运动鞋，以提高它们的效率。\n您可以保留或出售您铸造的运动鞋。\n$GST/$GMT 可以换成 $USDC。\n现在让我们研究一下 STEPN 的代币经济学。\n\n‍\n\n代币经济学\nSTEPN 加密货币经济模型由两个代币组成。$ GST是用于支付应用内奖励的实用代币。代币的供应量不受限制，但每次铸造、修复或升级时都会被烧毁。\n\nGreen Metaverse 代币（格林威治标准时间美元）的最大供应量上限为 60 亿，是 STEPN 的治理代币，也是投资者的主要价值储存手段。\n\n根据截至 2030 年 3 月的归属时间表，GMT 的供应分配如下：\n\n30% 用于应用内奖励\n30% 保留在国库中\n16\\.3% 预留给私人销售\n14\\.2% 被团队保留\n7% 预留给 Binance Launchpad 销售\n2\\.5% 分配给顾问。\n\n![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61fdc688c14c2d02be89c30e/62d05fcd8dad2319ddea7906_sYxFvbkY0xMu8paomkVPrzstWGCmDlZCdh-GzixvqXNmnmgYaMeMjVPtBsz37Pz5e0WoLHU5KwgrHePwWWZ1GaB1CczueP3CrrL2TxskhvciBLUMFZ_k_mf4Km7OOFTbPtoNX_qzsA-X-oaMD-M.png)\n\nGMT 持有者可以质押他们的代币以参与投票。在集体投票中，代币持有者决定将一定比例的代币捐赠给碳抵消计划。\n\n奖励通常以 GST 支付，但某些参数（例如拥有 30 级运动鞋）允许他们在 GMT 时获得。随着时间的推移，代币的排放率由于各种机制而降低，包括减半计划。\n\n‍\n\n## 附加的功能\n\n**神秘盒子**\n\n在单人模式下移动时，神秘盒子会随机掉落。它包含 $GST 和宝石（1 - 3 级）。每个用户有四个神秘盒子插槽。神秘盒子有 10 种品质。收到神秘盒子后，倒计时会自动开始。当倒计时结束时，用户会花费少量 $GST（“基本成本”）来打开它。倒计时持续时间随着神秘盒子的质量而增加。\n\n**运动鞋质量**\n\n运动鞋有五种品质（普通、罕见、稀有、史诗和传奇）。铸造运动鞋时，每个属性的值都是在运动鞋质量决定的最小值和最大值之间随机选择的。因此，即使是相同品质的 Sneaker，也可能有着明显不同的属性等级。当达到某些里程碑时，用户需要消耗 $GMT 来升级他们的运动鞋。 \n\n**‍ 制**鞋业\n\n在造鞋活动 (SME) 期间，用户使用他们拥有的两个运动鞋作为蓝图来“繁殖”，创建一个鞋盒。作为参考，这两款 Sneaker 将被称为 Vintages（父母）。\n\n为了开始 SME，两个 Vintage 都必须由用户拥有（非租用）并且完全耐用。然后，用户可以通过访问 Mint 选项卡、选择 Sneaker 并按下 Mint 来选择要“繁殖”的 Sneaker。两种年份都有 72 小时的铸币冷却时间，但在此期间它们仍可用于移动。[在此处](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/game-fi-elements/shoe-minting)了解铸币成本。\n\n \n

游戏模式\n\n**独奏模式**\n\n用户通过穿着 NFT 运动鞋在单人模式中赚取代币。需要能源才能赚取 $GST。只有在用户获得 NFT 运动鞋后才会补充能量：1 能量等于 5 分钟的 Move-to-Earn 运动。 \n\n**马拉松模式（开发中）**\n\n马拉松模式要求用户提前 24 小时在 Marathon Tab 下注册。马拉松将每周和每月举行一次。[在此处](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/game-fi-elements/game-modes)了解有关每周马拉松和每月马拉松的更多信息。\n\n‍\n\n## 市场低迷影响STEPN\n\nSTEPN 代币的价格随着整体熊市而下跌，因为治理代币和实用代币均较今年早些时候的历史高点下跌了 80% 至 98%。在 4 月达到顶峰时，$GMT 和 $GST 分别为 4.19 美元和 9.36 美元。此后，两个代币均呈下行趋势，形势严峻。\n\n![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61fdc688c14c2d02be89c30e/62d05fcdbfcdbe4dab5e7765_xevUYf6_w1tdTrVwiyK5l_hj8GL4G4prhTXJ6oxRbR9IIy_zKD8fPRUDLIoLWHUrBYAug-RqmLemfheQR4MjoQan-V9JmJuzVX6zjtybiyX373f4NE36SGhAKvv8CGyBRy1KeBdVrpxJWdGTLrI.png)\n\n[Source](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/green-satoshi-token/):

STEPN 应用程序在中国被禁止。 \n\n> *“自从中国禁赛以来，这就是一场大屠杀，价格大幅下降，以至于对于小跑步者/步行者来说，去散步几乎没有回报。” 一位 STEPN 用户和[BSC 新闻](https://www.bsc.news/)的密切接触者说。“Solana 和 GST 的价格下降了，鞋子变得非常便宜（我的鞋子损失惨重）。”*\n\n在 STEPN 流行的高峰期，用户可以通过在单人模式下在附近慢跑来赚取数百美元。即使使用基本运动鞋，也有可能以 9.36 美元的最高价格获得 3-4 美元 GST 的 NFT 每日奖励。目前，同样的步行，在 4 月份可以为用户赚取高达 40 美元的收益，但收益仅为 0.82 美元左右。\n\n以前，使用 Solana NFT 的成本约为 600 美元，获得正的投资回报率大约需要 16 天。但目前，截至 7 月 14 日，购买最便宜的 Sneaker 的成本约为 69.88 美元。以目前的价格点，投资者需要大约 145 天才能达到收支平衡，每天的回报为 0.70 美元。结果，一些社区成员之间出现了看跌情绪。\n\n> *“有些人还在玩游戏……我的意思是，距离禁令还有一个月的时间……如果我在中国，我会舒服地玩游戏，等到 7 月 10 日扔掉我的运动鞋离开。” STEPN Discord 的一位社区成员说。*\n\n‍\n\n## 积极推动\n\n[该公司在一篇Medium 帖子中](https://stepnofficial.medium.com/stepn-announces-q2-profits-initiates-quarterly-gmt-buyback-burn-32ad0b764de9)表示，尽管过去几个月加密市场状况有所下降，但 STEPN 第二季度的利润为 1.225 亿美元。\n\n![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61fdc688c14c2d02be89c30e/62d05fcdc1b73a81b3f58f07_vEzZAXj1gwGlcXFpQkP6DLvKQzHjdX_PhxU8AMhSLpLoO063GuZX3IUWtIghQU0dLMErhn9GiGOENRdFud8GdSPk33gTo2ZzbT_mxz9O7o4mJQudRLWIjrGnb0pJIiO3QYxpEwwfUTa3fZwbm58.png)\n\nM2E 协议计划利用其利润的 5% 为其 GMT 代币启动回购和销毁计划。然而，为防止价格突然波动，回购和销毁过程“可能需要几周时间才能完成”。\n\n此外，开发人员表示，除了回购和销毁计划之外，STEPN 将分配资本储备来改进现有功能并建立团队。尽管该协议面临挑战，但许多人仍然保持乐观。\n\n> *“如果 STEPN 团队最终确定了他们的产品并开始了大规模的营销活动，那么事情仍然可能再次上升。散步或跑步的赚钱部分吸引了许多人，他们只是还不知道，或者还不习惯使用加密钱包，”一位接近[BSC 新闻](http://bsc.news/)的 STEPN 成员说。“为了让 STEPN 成功，我认为他们需要针对没有加密领域经验的人开展大型营销活动，我认为他们应该为不了解私钥等的人提供托管钱包。 ”* \n\nSTEPN 报告称，该公司已经确定了几个投资其赚取资本的领域，以便改进游戏玩法。其中包括安全增强、防止机器人获得 GMT 的反作弊机制、建立开发人员和核心团队，以及确保赞助和合作伙伴关系。\n\n> *“我投入了很多。我现在不担心回报，因为我专注于长期。现在，我正在增加我在两条链上的持股量，增加我的主要鞋子，并为第三领域做准备，”一位社区成员说。*\n\n在 SOL[领域](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/realm)和 BNB 领域取得成功之后，STEPN 打算在以太坊上引入[APE 领域](https://www.web3wire.news/post/stepn-launches-realm-3-on-eth-announces-free-mint-for-bayc-holders)。\n\n> *STEPN 团队将这个 Realm 描述为“一个拥抱时尚和其他 NFT 社区的伟大实验”。*\n\nAPE Realm 将为所有 STEPN 用户提供对创新的新 Realm

离别的思念\n\n由于行业低迷，以及中国数据法禁止存储公民 GPS 数据，STEPN 不得不屏蔽中国用户。此外，STEPN 的平台自推出以来一直受到一系列分布式拒绝服务 (DDoS) 攻击，导致用户在维护期间被警告“可能无法正确记录锻炼”。\n\n然而，如果 STEPN 克服了这些障碍，加密货币市场可能会成为一个蓬勃发展的行业。此外，如果它的经济激励措施能激励一些人离开沙发开始行动，那也是一件好事。\n\n![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61fdc688c14c2d02be89c30e/62d05fcd1094f2f5b8f4c15e_7Spv0lY4jSSP2PNdzoyjEfz39swMjvAega2X4nwRYx6R8jY8XS8gRaGej0NFrXfNMSiKvER_8p5ubPWBPPVTOxF8watKMliEarlaONJie8pgIem4iEe0U3JehZsvewhEeU0dhSeJHsouf1A8tyY.png)\n\nSTEPN 社区在社交媒体上非常活跃，仅在 Twitter 上就有超过 640,000 名关注者。许多用户在 NFT 市场上创造了高流动性，使升级后的运动鞋更容易出售。最后但同样重要的是，即将到来的租赁升级和以太坊上的 Ape Realm 应该会增加用户群，增加所有代币的价值。\n\n‍\n\n## 什么是步骤：\n\nSTEPN 是一个结合了 GameFi 和 SocialFi 元素的 Web3 应用程序，允许用户 Move & Earn（移动和赚取）。用户将通过步行、慢跑或户外跑步来获得游戏内代币。STEPN 在 GST 和 GMT 两种代币机制下运行（治理代币，供应有限）。\n\n在哪里可以找到 StepN：\n\n[网站](http://stepn.com/)| [推特](https://twitter.com/Stepnofficial)|
