{"id": "2GsEhN7mVVKyzU5Cr1shhFAyW1n62oqtNwZbOtlqCms", "title": "Building With Optimism at Decasonic Labs", "body": "**As Bari Weiss put it ever so articulately in *The Case for American Seriousness*: \n * \n “You can’t be an incredible investor if you look at the world with ironic detachment. If you are a naysayer. Or a cynic. Skeptical, yes, of course. But fundamentally you have to believe that individuals with tremendous willpower can do things. Great, shocking, inconceivable things. Like find your husband on your phone. Or build a spaceship to go to another planet. Or create a new currency.”***\n\nThis is an indisputable, capital T, Truth. I have been a venture investor for a very limited amount of time, but if there is anything I’ve learned, it is only and absolutely this. Being an excellent early stage investor definitionally requires taking the future seriously, and as I’ve learned through my life experiences, the future is mostly uncertain, subject to a seemingly infinite amount of variables, and depending on your views, probabilistic. Progress is never clear cut, and as a result finding non-consensus solutions to very large problems can seem like an insurmountable task. Early stage investing requires an incredibly ambitious, yet realistic optimism that is a difficult balance to cultivate.\n\nIn order to develop this mindset, one must acquire a rigorous and analytical way of thinking about things such that you become able to arrive at convincing arguments of a radically more productive, yet probable future. Oftentimes, these views may not be consensus as a result of the subtleties and variance of the paths by which the future can unfold, so one must also develop the nerve to stand on your own two feet.\n\nIf there is a unique mindset that encapsulates the success of Silicon Valley in becoming the mecca of venture capital, it is just this. In the silicon valley of the 2000s, you could find people like John Doerr, Marc Andreessen, and Vinod Khosla who took seemingly absurd conceptions about the future very seriously and labored through the logic of what a highly optimistic and unlikely future might entail in order to reach their own conclusions. Whether it was thinking rigorously in 1996 about a future where one could purchase any product they desire on a single internet website and expect it to arrive at your doorstep within one or two days, envisioning a website that makes the act of complete strangers renting each other their homes entirely mainstream, or conceiving of a future in which most people meet their significant others by swiping on pictures of complete strangers on their smartphones, these investors didn’t just think about the future, they also helped make it come to fruition.\n\nTaking inspiration from the greats in conceiving and building a highly optimistic future, I am proud to announce the summer 2022 launch of Decasonic Labs. At Decasonic Labs, we will be focused on bringing about the vision we have established at Decasonic through rigorous treatment of highly ambitious conceptions of the future. We are hiring for intern and full time positions across software engineering, frontend and backend development, and UX design to partner with the most ambitious builders that want to take the idea of a radically better future as seriously as we do. We will focus on building products that bring blockchain technology to the masses. The infrastructure has been built, but the user experiences and value propositions that drive mainstream adoption have an arduous path to tread. We strive to hold ourselves accountable to our brand as top tier builders and investors, by making tangible contributions to the Web3 ecosystem and pushing forward current boundaries in the user base. Decasonic Labs will be headquartered in Chicago, operating in a hybrid remote/office model such that we can engage in rapid iteration and testing to build the best products possible.\n\nWe strongly believe that embarking on this journey will make us even better investors and drive synergies within our portfolio. It is only by engaging in the arduous trial and failure of incubating companies and building products that one learns the lessons few put in the work to learn. When you’ve built a company you become intimately acquainted with these trials and tribulations, and you can build your own repository of knowledge from these experiences. As a result, we will be able to provide even better advisory to our portfolio companies and empathize with them as they go through the same journey. Furthermore, we are able to build products that create synergies within our portfolio and support our companies through that avenue. Strategically, we see this bear market as an excellent opportunity to act on our conviction by building and preparing for the next bear market with those that know the score will take care of itself.\n\nSo while panic ensues in the broader markets as a result of uncertainty about the macroeconomic future, we build. In the same essay, guest writer, Katherine Boyle states: \n  \n ***“There is no fixed pie when it comes to building. Building is an action, a choice, a decision to create and move. It is shovels in the dirt with a motley crew of doers who get the job done because no one else will. Building is the only certainty. The only thing we can control. When the projects we believed were Teflon strong are fraying like the history they toppled, the only thing to do is to make something new again.”***\n\nWe couldn’t agree more.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1654271765, "digest": "F6K1rd0LB0q4Q7x3vSIgZXYd32ye_2LKWd5qNjforho", "contributor": "0xC962c9262DC388ca0a44000dEae2E45922618366"}

I have been a venture investor for a very limited amount of time, but if there is anything I’ve learned, it is only and absolutely this. Being an excellent early stage investor definitionally requires taking the future seriously, and as I’ve learned through my life experiences, the future is mostly uncertain, subject to a seemingly infinite amount of variables, and depending on your views, probabilistic. Progress is never clear cut, and as a result finding non-consensus solutions to very large problems can seem like an insurmountable task. Early stage investing requires an incredibly ambitious, yet realistic optimism that is a difficult balance to cultivate.\n\nIn order to develop this mindset, one must acquire a rigorous and analytical way of thinking about things such that you become able to arrive at convincing arguments of a radically more productive, yet probable future. Oftentimes, these views may not be consensus as a result of the subtleties and variance of the paths by which the future can unfold, so one must also develop the nerve to stand on your own two feet.\n\nIf there is a unique mindset that encapsulates the success of Silicon Valley in becoming the mecca of venture capital, it is just this. In the silicon valley of the 2000s, you could find people like John Doerr, Marc Andreessen, and Vinod Khosla who took seemingly absurd conceptions about the future very seriously and labored through the logic of what a highly optimistic and unlikely future might entail in order to reach their own conclusions. Whether it was thinking rigorously in 1996 about a future where one could purchase any product they desire on a single internet website and expect it to arrive at your doorstep within one or two days, envisioning a website that makes the act of complete strangers renting each other their homes entirely mainstream, or conceiving of a future in which most people meet their significant others by swiping on pictures of complete strangers on their smartphones, these investors didn’t just think about the future, they also helped make it come to fruition.\n\nTaking inspiration from the greats in conceiving and building a highly optimistic future, I am proud to announce the summer 2022 launch of Decasonic Labs. At Decasonic Labs, we will be focused on bringing about the vision we have established at Decasonic through rigorous treatment of highly ambitious conceptions of the future. We are hiring for intern and full time positions across software engineering, frontend and backend development, and UX design to partner with the most ambitious builders that want to take the idea of a radically better future as seriously as we do. We will focus on building products that bring blockchain technology to the masses. The infrastructure has been built, but the user experiences and value propositions that drive mainstream adoption have an arduous path to tread. We strive to hold ourselves accountable to our brand as top tier builders and investors, by making tangible contributions to the Web3 ecosystem and pushing forward current boundaries in the user base. Decasonic Labs will be headquartered in Chicago, operating in a hybrid remote/office model such that we can engage in rapid iteration and testing to build the best products possible.\n\nWe strongly believe that embarking on this journey will make us even better investors and drive synergies within our portfolio. It is only by engaging in the arduous trial and failure of incubating companies and building products that one learns the lessons few put in the work to learn. When you’ve built a company you become intimately acquainted with these trials and tribulations, and you can build your own repository of knowledge from these experiences. As a result, we will be able to provide even better advisory to our portfolio companies and empathize with them as they go through the same journey.

Protocols and products that create advocates who bring in others because they are convicted will create an essential flywheel of onboarding with a positive feedback loop.\n\nCommunity and in conjunction growth are now an integral part of the fabric of culture in general and in crypto especially. It creates an infinitely scalable opportunity that encompasses anything from marketing activations to technical breakthroughs on a grassroots level.\n\nThis has been my primary focus and a nascent point of excitement since I entered crypto in 2020 and I aim to have the privilege of working on it as long as I can.\n\n![(ignore the above meme - I actually do stuff outside of making memes) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vrOr0vJUWjjDe8V_H4p00.png?height=499&width=517)\n\n**So, what does my role look like?**\n\nAs Head of Community and Growth, I’ll be working directly with portfolio companies to create uniquely personalized journeys for the founders we work with.\n\nI’ll be doing this by examining what the founders want for their community of users, brainstorming what long term growth might look like with each company, and working with other parts of Chapter One (Founder Experience, Talent and Education, Research and Experiments) to create the most holistic experience for Chapter One’s portfolio.\n\nIn addition, I’m excited to dive into developing and curating resources surrounding community, growth, and business development and open-sourcing anything I find for the public good. Long term, I hope to build robust connections within the space to generate content that helps surface best practices for decentralized communities, internal and external, as well as scalable GTM playbooks for companies of all shapes and sizes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MDeBKe1oIdvwb5ZBjog0Z.png?height=500&width=1000)\n\n**What brought me here?**\n\nI’ve always been a big believer in trying and experiencing first before judging. This has brought me on a wild journey where I submerged myself into different fields from the government defense industry, airline industry, spatial work startups, to multi-billion hedge funds — ultimately landing in crypto where I now call home.\n\nI think it would be remiss to not highlight a few formative experiences below.\n\n* **Delta** ✈️ - my first job as a sophomore in college.\n  * From the first day where I could barely figure my way around the spreadsheet maze, to my last month (a year and a half later) where I was responsible for staffing entire airports on my own using scripts and processes I had worked on. Oh yea, also the free flights worldwide, those were nice.\n* **Zeet** 💻 - my first introduction to startups.\n  * This job was an important view into how a good leader can unlock and empower someone to achieve much more than they could ever imagine. Here I was able to self-start, own, and execute high-leverage projects with little oversight and a lot of encouragement. Shoutout to Johnny Dallas (+ frens), where without them I for sure wouldn’t be where I am now.\n* **Branch** ✨ - my first FT(ish) job.\n  * This job gave me the first glimpse into the serendipity that could be possible in the metaverse. Being a Customer Success Manager I was able to see the direct impact my interactions could have in a B2B/B2C context as well as how important education was for a product regardless of how intuitive it might seem, an essential lesson, especially in crypto.\n* **Special mention to D.E. Shaw**🏦 - a look into the trad-fi void.\n  * This gave me an intimate inside look into the vast world of finance that remains abysmally archaic for the everyday person. From learning about how markets were made to the complex technical systems that facilitate the millisecond trades executed on a day-to-day basis. This look behind the curtain gave me the push I needed to finally land me permanently into crypto.\n\nFinding myself glued to everything crypto. It led me down a rabbit hole of learning and finding what I was passionate about (memes, people, and data) which dropped me right into the team @ Rainbow Wallet🌈 . Here I spent my time at Rainbow dreaming of ways to help onboard the next generation of crypto users through an accessible interface as simple but impactful as a crypto wallet.\n\nBut with Rainbow being my *Chapter Zero*, a proverbial foreword to my ongoing and seemingly never-ending adventure in crypto, I’m super thrilled to begin *Chapter One* of my crypto journey with an amazing team, and even more importantly the amazing community of crypto that has brought me to where I am.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n34OYKT8Y6MmXuU9iZLvC.png?height=500&width=666)\n\n**Let’s Connect!**\n\nThe next few months are going to be fast paced, productive, and invigorating which I can’t wait to lean into and bring y’all on the ride as well. I’m always looking for more people to vibe on crazy ideas with and chat about community, growth, biz dev, and anything meme-related in crypto.

No-one before had imagined that a blockchain can be attacked and forced to be halted. \n\n \n Well that’s what happened to the **TERRA** network. Its native token LUNA lost 100% of its value.\n\n![LUNA Market history over past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_a6dKTArZU9hpPtcX9tbV.png?height=382&width=488)\n\n## Stable Coins\n\nThere are two types of currencies in blockchain, one that you want to increase in prices i.e. the native tokens so that you can gain high ROI’s e.g. Ether, BTC etc. Other one is stable-coins, you want these to stay near 1$ i.e. their initial pegging. They are programmed in such a way that they stay low. They are considered the safe channel if you want to go long on your assets. For a better understanding, you can relate them with government securities in terms of traditional trading, they don’t offer high ROI’s but profits are guaranteed even if they are low. There are many such tokens as Tether’s USD, or US Center government’s USDC**.** \n\n## UST-LUNA\n\nLike USDT, USDC, **TERRA** network has its own stable-coin UST. Now unlike other stable-coins, which are backed up by liquidity in form of real money in the banks, UST is an algorithmically stable coin. Do Kwon, founder of the Terra network, designed this token. As per the theory, UST is 1:1 pegged to Terra’s LUNA. It means UST holders can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA by burning the UST and minting LUNA.\n\n## Attack Phase -1\n\nUST doesn’t have any other utility other than Terra’s most popular [Anchor Protocol](https://www.anchorprotocol.com/#). Anchor offers 20% yield for deposits, this is far more than any other protocol. But this deal is only effective to the UST, no other stable-coins, be it USDC, USDT. \n\nAs per April end, 72% of all the UST was locked into Anchor, estimated around 14 billion dollars.\n\nImagine a bank offering 20% interest on your deposits, obviously everyone would go to that bank and earn that pretty money. That’s what happened with Anchor, as the time passed, the number of lenders increased, but the number of borrowers kept decreasing, in this case a proposal was drawn and it was clear that those pretty 20% interest rates were not going to stand. \n\nAfter hearing the news, people started pulling their locked UST out from Anchor. Since there is no other use of UST, people started getting out of the Terra network\n\n[Anchor Docs](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/)\n\n## Attack Phase -2\n\nNow to exit UST, there are two options, one- the inbuilt burn and mint mechanism, where one can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA, Second option is stable-coin exchange, Curve Finance.\n\nCurve provides liquidity pools for stable coins, same existed for UST too, specifically (UST+3crv pool).\n\nWhen people took out their UST they started swapping it into the curve pool. It increased the amount of UST and decreased the amount of other stable-coins, resulting in the destabilization of the pool.  \n\nTo make things worse, at least one individual dumped about $85 Million worth UST tokens, and exchanged them for USDC. This created an imbalance in the pool. Now to tip the scales back, according to the protocols, Anchor starts offering UST at a discounted price. This was the initial step in de-pegging of UST. This eventually resulted in the drowning of LUNA in the market.\n\n![Transaction showing deposit of $85 Million worth UST](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8i8MY1SsFCuLvCtGvj89p.png?height=390&width=600)\n\n## Attack Phase -3\n\nNow every blockchain has a safe guard which steps in at the moment of crisis. Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) was Terra’s shield in this case. It dumped non-UST stable-coins worth approximately $216 Million into the curve pool to regain the balance. This technique did work for sometime but the prices continued to degrade as people continued to get out of Terra. Panic played a crucial role in the plummeting of the Market, traders/investors lost their trust in Terra. \n\nNow to compensate for the loss in the portfolios, people started selling their other assets to absorb the shock. This resulted in the falling of the market altogether.\n\nDo Kwon had already thought about any incident of such kind, some time later after launching UST, he started buying Bitcoin as safe reserves. But those reserves were not enough to compensate for the destruction.\n\nThis kind of attack forced the blockchain to halt, a decision collectively taken by all the nodes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter the whole month of analyzing , it’s safe to say that we still are at a very early stage, there’s a lot to learn, a lot to unravel, a lot to study. One has to take every step very cautiously because it’s real money at stake here. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1654273711, "digest": "Xup_PA8A5ZGz0bA_7TKb8sp8GgSPuJWSQ-qn00aSnWI", "contributor": "0xC6036B8c3F911f936b661a075CFAA4B802b75cc3"}

We believe in building a “multi-chapter story” with the founders we invest in. We strive to become a venture contributor fund — getting our hands dirty helping on multiple fronts such as Founder Experience, Talent and Education, or Product with founders when they need us.\n\nJeff and Mene have assembled a fantastic group of immensely talented individuals who come from diverse backgrounds — bringing with them an arsenal of incredible experiences that can be immediately applied to the day-to-day work that we do regardless of the scenario thrown at us.\n\nI’m so excited to dive into the themes that Chapter One believes in:\n\n* **Multiplayer Money**: crypto being the foundation of unlocking group coordination\n* **Next Billion Owners:** onboarding the next generation of crypto users\n* **Cult Communities:** a focus point for helping unlock radical thinkers to manifest their ideas\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YFoFewVthgf2WPNL5PTXM.png?height=348&width=717)\n\n**WHY Community and Growth?**\n\nFundamentally, there will come a time when yields taper and the world of crypto no longer flouts outrageous APY's or gains to entice newcomers. Those that continue to evangelize crypto and its community will do it, not because of speculative monetary gains, but because of the right onboarding experience.\n\nI believe that communities that border on cults will help onboard, lock-in, and engage the next generation of crypto natives. Protocols and products that create advocates who bring in others because they are convicted will create an essential flywheel of onboarding with a positive feedback loop.\n\nCommunity and in conjunction growth are now an integral part of the fabric of culture in general and in crypto especially. It creates an infinitely scalable opportunity that encompasses anything from marketing activations to technical breakthroughs on a grassroots level.\n\nThis has been my primary focus and a nascent point of excitement since I entered crypto in 2020 and I aim to have the privilege of working on it as long as I can.\n\n![(ignore the above meme - I actually do stuff outside of making memes) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vrOr0vJUWjjDe8V_H4p00.png?height=499&width=517)\n\n**So, what does my role look like?**\n\nAs Head of Community and Growth, I’ll be working directly with portfolio companies to create uniquely personalized journeys for the founders we work with.\n\nI’ll be doing this by examining what the founders want for their community of users, brainstorming what long term growth might look like with each company, and working with other parts of Chapter One (Founder Experience, Talent and Education, Research and Experiments) to create the most holistic experience for Chapter One’s portfolio.\n\nIn addition, I’m excited to dive into developing and curating resources surrounding community, growth, and business development and open-sourcing anything I find for the public good. Long term, I hope to build robust connections within the space to generate content that helps surface best practices for decentralized communities, internal and external, as well as scalable GTM playbooks for companies of all shapes and sizes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MDeBKe1oIdvwb5ZBjog0Z.png?height=500&width=1000)\n\n**What brought me here?**\n\nI’ve always been a big believer in trying and experiencing first before judging. This has brought me on a wild journey where I submerged myself into different fields from the government defense industry, airline industry, spatial work startups, to multi-billion hedge funds — ultimately landing in crypto where I now call home.\n\nI think it would be remiss to not highlight a few formative experiences below.\n\n* **Delta** ✈️ - my first job as a sophomore in college.\n  * From the first day where I could barely figure my way around the spreadsheet maze, to my last month (a year and a half later) where I was responsible for staffing entire airports on my own using scripts and processes I had worked on. Oh yea, also the free flights worldwide, those were nice.\n* **Zeet** 💻 - my first introduction to startups.\n  * This job was an important view into how a good leader can unlock and empower someone to achieve much more than they could ever imagine. Here I was able to self-start, own, and execute high-leverage projects with little oversight and a lot of encouragement. Shoutout to Johnny Dallas (+ frens), where without them I for sure wouldn’t be where I am now.\n* **Branch** ✨ - my first FT(ish) job.\n  * This job gave me the first glimpse into the serendipity that could be possible in the metaverse. Being a Customer Success Manager I was able to see the direct impact my interactions could have in a B2B/B2C context as well as how important education was for a product regardless of how intuitive it might seem, an essential lesson, especially in crypto.\n* **Special mention to D.E. Shaw**🏦 - a look into the trad-fi void.\n  * This gave me an intimate inside look into the vast world of finance that remains abysmally archaic for the everyday person. From learning about how markets were made to the complex technical systems that facilitate the millisecond trades executed on a day-to-day basis. This look behind the curtain gave me the push I needed to finally land me permanently into crypto.\n\nFinding myself glued to everything crypto. It led me down a rabbit hole of learning and finding what I was passionate about (memes, people, and data) which dropped me right into the team @ Rainbow Wallet🌈 . Here I spent my time at Rainbow dreaming of ways to help onboard the next generation of crypto users through an accessible interface as simple but impactful as a crypto wallet.\n\nBut with Rainbow being my *Chapter Zero*, a proverbial foreword to my ongoing and seemingly never-ending adventure in crypto, I’m super thrilled to begin *Chapter One* of my crypto journey with an amazing team, and even more importantly the amazing community of crypto that has brought me to where I am.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n34OYKT8Y6MmXuU9iZLvC.png?height=500&width=666)\n\n**Let’s Connect!**\n\nThe next few months are going to be fast paced, productive, and invigorating which I can’t wait to lean into and bring y’all on the ride as well. I’m always looking for more people to vibe on crazy ideas with and chat about community, growth, biz dev, and anything meme-related in crypto.

Since there is no other use of UST, people started getting out of the Terra network\n\n[Anchor Docs](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/)\n\n## Attack Phase -2\n\nNow to exit UST, there are two options, one- the inbuilt burn and mint mechanism, where one can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA, Second option is stable-coin exchange, Curve Finance.\n\nCurve provides liquidity pools for stable coins, same existed for UST too, specifically (UST+3crv pool).\n\nWhen people took out their UST they started swapping it into the curve pool. It increased the amount of UST and decreased the amount of other stable-coins, resulting in the destabilization of the pool.\n\nTo make things worse, at least one individual dumped about $85 Million worth UST tokens, and exchanged them for USDC. This created an imbalance in the pool. Now to tip the scales back, according to the protocols, Anchor starts offering UST at a discounted price. This was the initial step in de-pegging of UST. This eventually resulted in the drowning of LUNA in the market.\n\n![Transaction showing deposit of $85 Million worth UST](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8i8MY1SsFCuLvCtGvj89p.png?height=390&width=600)\n\n## Attack Phase -3\n\nEvery blockchain has a safe guard which steps in at the moment of crisis. Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) was Terra’s shield in this case. It dumped non-UST stable-coins worth approximately $216 Million into the curve pool to regain the balance. This technique did work for sometime but the prices continued to degrade as people continued to get out of Terra. Panic played a crucial role in the plummeting of the Market, traders/investors lost their trust in Terra.\n\nNow to compensate for the loss in the portfolios, people started selling their other assets to absorb the shock. This resulted in the falling of the market altogether.\n\nDo Kwon had already thought about any incident of such kind, some time later after launching UST, he started buying Bitcoin as safe reserves. But those reserves were not enough to compensate for the destruction.\n\nThis kind of attack forced the blockchain to halt, a decision collectively taken by all the nodes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter the whole month of analyzing , it’s safe to say that we still are at a very early stage, there’s a lot to learn, a lot to unravel, a lot to study. One has to take every step very cautiously because it’s real money at stake here.", "timestamp": 1654274181, "digest": "Xup_PA8A5ZGz0bA_7TKb8sp8GgSPuJWSQ-qn00aSnWI", "contributor": "0xC6036B8c3F911f936b661a075CFAA4B802b75cc3"}

{"id": "7QErkOlpsRwvWTO6wURvXG1C7_bru974ZU0J7isxXCI", "title": "Forecasting a Music NFT Drop", "body": "## Vérité - “He’s Not You” via Royal\n\n*(scroll down to view forecast)*\n\nIn music’s Web3 future, everyone can be an investor, backing their favorite artists and projects. This shift towards an open and democratized support system between creator and collector has the potential to change the economic structure of the music industry and the artist-fan relationship — for the better. Much better, if things unfold properly.\n\nWith each passing day, more artists are coming up with creative ways to offer non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Since June 2020, there have been 1.68M music NFTs sold, generating just under $100M in primary sale revenue (*Water & Music, Jan 2022*). It would take \\~23.7 Billion streams to generate that same revenue for artists.\n\n![Music NFT primary revenue total and number of streams for artists to accrue this revenue (Water & Music, Jan 2022).](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XIpsoNER3OxSx6Dqa5E9V.png?height=347&width=805)\n\n## Royalty-bearing NFTs\n\nOne type of NFT offering with real disruptive power is the royalty-bearing NFT (sometimes referred to as S-NFTs); those in which artists offer a portion of their royalty share to collectors. This mechanism allows collectors to own a fractionalized portion of a song, album, or even catalog, and share in its future success. For artists, this atypical influx of capital can jumpstart their careers, fund their creative projects, build community, and detach them from the traditional, often predatory, economic structure of the music industry.\n\nRoyalty-bearing NFT drops have been met with intense excitement recently as the earliest drops from platforms Royal (Nas and 3LAU) and Opulous (Lil Pump and Soulja Boy) sold out in minutes.\n\nOn Monday, Royal announced their next drop: 39% of the streaming royalties in Vérité’s single “He’s Not You”*.*\n\n![Ownership royalties and benefits by token level for Vérité's 'He's Not You' NFT drop (Royal.io).](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DtfNDTwlcukP3O5RKcLmx.png?height=1510&width=2206&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n## Discoverability\n\nThus far it seems only established artists are being featured in these early S-NFT drops. This makes sense as it’s early days — but in order to empower creators of all sizes with these resources, we need new tools for discovery and understanding value.\n\n***If music’s Web3 future doesn’t solve discoverability, then NFTs will only enrich artists with preexisting name value and community. This isn’t the future we believe in.***\n\nWe are building data-driven ai models that look at audio patterns and incorporate insights from our research on the neuroscience of music enjoyment$^1$ to find songs that push boundaries optimally and are positioned to over-perform expectation if given the right attention. As the space becomes flooded with more S-NFTs in the coming years, we believe this technology will shine a light on the hidden gems and connect them to supportive collectors, so that all sides can fairly share in the rewards.\n\n***It is difficult for collectors and creators to understand the future royalty value of these NFTs***. We have created a platform that fills this need — [dopr](https://www.dopr.com/) — where collectors will be able to value, discover, and track music NFTs.\n\n## Vérité Forecast\n\ndopr provides 5-year forecasts for streaming and royalty earnings (by quarter), cumulative stats, and a recoupment calculator which breaks down the number of streams and length of time needed for a token-holder to break even.\n\nTo view the full forecast and get early access to dopr click [here](https://www.dopr.com).\n\n![Five-years streams and earnings forecast for Vérité's drop.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mJyUrri_XUrp3NSdJ-wFg.png?height=1634&width=2270)\n\n### In the five year period dopr predicted:\n\n* On-Demand Streams: **2.5M**\n* Total Earnings: **$10.2k**\n* Gold Token Earnings: **$5**\n* Platinum Token Earnings: **$23**\n* Diamond Token Earnings: **$88**\n\nThe drop offers Gold, Platinum, and Diamond tokens, which all have different costs, royalty shares, and additional benefits. dopr shows the expected royalty earnings for each token over a five-year period. dopr estimates that the tokens wouldn’t be recouped through royalties for more than 200 years (Gold), 125 years (Platinum), and 80 years (Diamond).\n\n![The recoupment calculator estimates the time and streams needed for token owners to breakeven, along with other details for each offering.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Qzwe4EmycvNzPUdZdjSOa.png?height=426&width=2270)\n\nThe recoupment calculator displays the costs associated with each token, cost per 1%, royalty share, and streams and time needed to breakeven. On its face, the tokens’ pricing and expected revenue to be generated for ‘he’s not you’ don’t seem to align.\n\nHowever, much of the craze resonating among music S-NFT collectors isn’t focused on the royalty payouts. For a portion of collectors, their value is realized through fandom, social badging, scarcity, and even private experiences, such as the 1:1 video chat Vérité is offering the five Diamond token owners. Each token level has additional benefits beyond the % royalties owned:\n\n* **Gold**: Signed Cassette Tape, Exclusive Access to Vérité NFT Collector Discord channel\n* **Platinum**: Exclusive \"He's Not You\" Vérité Discord access, Plus all Gold Extras\n* **Diamond**: 1:1 Video Call with Vérité, Plus all Gold and Platinum Extras\n\nFor her biggest fans, the chance to have a 1:1 video chat may be priceless. This is in addition to the value these tokens may maintain on the secondary market (attached to royalty value), or in the intangible value of supporting, community, and collectorship.\n\nUltimately, supporting artists and the platforms aiming to empower them in this space has much value in its own right.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nWe envision a future where the 50M worldwide music creators are funded directly from supportive collectors, with all sharing in the rewards. Help us make this a reality.\n\nGet early access [here](https://www.dopr.com).\n\n[www.dopr.com](https://www.dopr.com)\n\n[www.twitter.com/dopr_ai](https://www.twitter.com/dopr_ai)", "timestamp": 1654275370, "digest": "0t6ePJYklo98ua4xceE_92GB0jWJYOSK5ujBi-SJ00k", "contributor": "0x0ac073bAB13cFacd44A5Dc7b063035E43A223014"}

Rebels是谁？\n\n> 通过融合艺术和技术，改变我们的数字身份。\n\n项目本身是一个3D PFP，总发行量为13370个。**Sudo** ?个， ***Leet*高级白**1337个，**白名单**7331个。剩余数量会作为公售全部释出。Rebels的愿景是将叛军作为NFT项目之间的桥梁成为个人身份标志（DID）。项目的灵感来自于很多不同的方向：巴黎的时尚、Apex的游戏画风、以及世界各地的反抗者们。\n\n团队在2021年12月开始了Rebels的孵化，起初创始人发现了一个NFT的普遍问题：单一的NFT局限了用户的展示性，用户无法通过头像去展示自己持有的NFTs，通常需要通过横幅聚合器才可以做到展示持有的NFTs。因此我们需要一个方法去更好的展示我们的NFTs。Rebels便应运而生。\n\n项目最大的亮点在于其主打的可定制化NFT和可编程性，NFT定制化让一张Rebels的NFT作为底图，搭配其独有的徽章系统，使得其他项目的 NFT 可以当作衣服上的徽章所展示。这样，仅凭一张 NFT 就可以进入各大NFT项目， 然后展现自己持有或做出贡献的项目。Rebels持有者将会被赋予该NFTs的**商业权限**。这个商业权包含了之后的版权和商业使用。例如：潮牌服装，Sub DAO, 周边，二次创作盈利等。\n\nMint信息， mint价格和数量都是基于a16z已有的数据进行分析之后得出的。从AMA的回答来看，Nass至少参考了市面上上百个项目。除此之外，Nass许多决策也效仿了a16z之前的[文章](https://a16z.com/2022/03/31/nft-mint-data-early-decisions/)：“The NFT Mint ‘Sweet Spot’: Data on Early Decisions”中提及的一些建议。例如以较低的mint价格，帮助用户提高回报率。\n\n* **Mint**时间：**6月12号**\n* **Sudo**   可以mint**三**个：**free + free + 0.08e + Gas**\n* **Leet**    可以mint**二**个：**free + 0.08e + Gas**\n* **白名单**

创始人，在设计、零售和区块链方面的经验使她成为项目的完美顾问。在NFT领域为Rebels的大局做出了贡献，并与创始人一起制定未来计划。\n\n## 路线图\n\n关于路线图，Nass本人曾多次强调不喜欢过多的描述未来会做的，而是着重于做什么说什么。因此项目的进程基本只能透过AMA得知。\n\n**首次AMA** - 02月12号 - 主题为项目方doxxed，项目起因，和生态构建的愿景。本次AMA，Nass首次提出了定制化概念，但却并未透露太多信息。\n\n**第二次AMA** - 03月20号 - 高级白1337（LEET）公布，mint数量和大致时间公布。更具体的讲解了定制化NFT的概念，以及社区的运营方针。\n\n**第三次AMA** - 04月13号 - 本次AMA回答了社区内部的一些疑惑，重点讲解了定制化NFT的核心和技术概述，以及生态的可能性。\n\n**第四次中文区flash AMA** - 04月27号 - 徽章系统和合约使用问题\n\n**第五次中文space AMA** - 5月7号 - 新技术亮点透露，冷钱包技术。中文区运营方针，合约安全和sub DAO支持\n\n**第六次AMA -** 5月28号 - 主要公布了mint的时间与计划\n\n## 定制化NFT\n\nRebels与其他项目有着很多区别，这也是为什么我会长久的在这个社区里进行知识分享。其中最独特的莫过于其独创的定制化系统。Rebels NFT将会作为一个基点，通过patch徽章系统，允许用户佩戴不同的徽章去展示其持有的NFT。例如一个用户持有BAYC，那么这个用户可以通过定制化系统，把持有的BAYC佩戴到Rebels NFT上。由此一来，用户便能透过一个NFT去打通多个社区。我们将其称之为桥梁——NFT桥梁。\n\n**定制化流程**\n\n* Patch系统是目前最主要的定制化选项\n* 正在评估定制化在技术上的可行性（feasibility），将会有更深入的定制化选项\n* 背景颜色的定制可能性，项目方正在讨论当中，可能在未来开放\n* 项目方将会在未来开放越来越多的定制化选项\n* 定制化流程\n  * 官方网站互动界面\n  * 选择开放的定制化选项\n  * 选择在何处放置patch\n  * 交互上链\n  * 尽可能流畅的用户体验\n\n### Patch\n\n徽章系统，顾名思义，每个徽章都是一个NFT，将徽章佩戴需要借助官网交互。从目前的信息来看徽章NFT可以分为三种：\n\n* 钱包内的NFT\n\n\n* 首批NFT认证将会聚焦于认证的蓝筹，例如Yuga Labs的项目，MoonBirds，Invisible Friends, Doodles。帮助项目宣传\n* 之后会基于Opensea认证来增加这个名单。\n\n\n* 官方提供的一次性徽章，主要为纪念作用\n  * 例如高级白 1337的成员会有独有的LEET徽章去证明1337对社区的贡献。\n  * 但转售时这类徽章将被销毁，同时，一旦佩戴**疑似**不可逆\n* 官方提供的持久徽章\n\n\n* 初期会和设计师，和艺术家合作\n* 之后可能开放**二创**\n\n**转售**\n\n* 当转卖叛军NFT时，patch的变动分两种情况\n\n\n* 如果绑定了官方提供的patch，则patch跟随NFT一起售卖\n* 如果绑定了钱包里的其他NFT，交易成功后这一patch会消失\n\n**冷钱包创新：**\n\n当Rebels的NFTs储存在冷钱包，用户仍可以在官网上进行定制化更改，给NFT上Patch。通过这个创新机制，用户可以最大限度的保证NFTs安全。\n\n**合约**\n\n从目前的信息来看，721A并非最优选择。721A的创新在于打包Mint，但是在面对转移时仍旧面临高额的Gas费用。从已收到的消息来看，可能会基于721x去重新构建一套体系。除了基础的mint合约，定制化交互合约也是团队的重心之一。团队目前讨论了许多方法，并试图提取各个方法的优点，从而创建独有的合约标准。\n\n**安全措施**\n\n* Discord安全性，discord安全管理是业内非常专业著名工程师，经常是第一个对业内事件做出反应。nass等创始人也没有discord完全权限。\n* 合约编写方面是业界有十几年经验的软件工程师，还请到了加密领域合约审计最优秀的人来审计。兼顾内部和外部审核，以及压力测试。\n* 在Mint之前，合约将会在GitHub**完全公开**，届时会开启**bug bounty**\n\n## 项目分析\n\n### 社群运营\n\n以Discord和Twitter为主，因为a16z的运营策略，人均加密KOL。这个对项目本身也是利好。在第二次space AMA中，我们发现了7名a16z加密组成员，虽然a16z无法官宣支持，据Nass透露，项目有受到a16z成员的帮助和支持。Nass自己经常会发twitter去阐述他的理想和想法，这使得社区的凝聚力变得更强。\n\n目前Discord人数为73.7K人，活跃用户在5k\\~6k左右。\n\n目前Twitter关注人数为86K人，平均点赞为1.4k\\~2k，4月22号的图片释出达到高峰7.2K。\n\nWL主要聚焦成员的活跃，虽然无固定规则，但是审核机制十分严谨。具有两层审核。有别于其他项目Rebels的Mod，并无发放权力只有提名权力。每个Mod都有着丰富的项目经历，借助这些经历才能更好的辨别机器人和工作室，试图最大限度的把白名单给到真正为社区做贡献的成员。同时成员之间也有提名权，当一个成员正真深得人心的时候，成员便会自发的去提名。另外，从高级白的发放也可以看到，社区对早期成员的贡献的认可。目前白名单人数为3.58k，高级白人数为527，SUDO人数为4人。\n\n###

外部合作\n\n对于外部合作，Nass更希望与社区内部建立长期的合作，建立社区之间的桥梁，以我们的艺术与技术为重点。我们会与自己（Rebels）社区NFT或画家进行合作。比如x0r，3lau。同时Nass觉得和其他项目合作进行~~交换~~WL交换的意义并不是很大，项目之间共享社区成员，会导致成员在社区的参与感或贡献度降低。WL合作越多，越容易拉进来墙头草。其实抽奖发白，WL合作所面向的仍然是同一批用户。\n\n## 个人分析\n\nRebels应该说是我接触到的第一个项目，也因为此项目认识到了很多人，接触到了web3的内核，去寻找自己在这个行业的理由。我为什么想要写这篇研报？~~，~~我为什么热爱这个项目？~~，~~我为什么能拿到Sudo？~~。~~下面我从我~~自己~~的亲身经验和体验进行了个人想法的阐述~~探讨~~，所有信息都是由这几个月的亲身经历~~体验，~~总结下来的。最后还是想说，我仅代表我本人的看法~~的看法只是我的看法~~，DYOR才是这个圈子最重要的。\n\n### 反抗\n\n我们在文章初期提及了这个项目的原意是反抗，那么我们究竟为何反抗，反抗什么？目前我们正在经历熊市，希望能度过这个难关。熊市学习，牛市fomo。但是牛市的fomo真的是好事吗。纵观过往的这几个月，看到了很多也体验了很多。目前的市场仿佛被fomo的情绪带动，宛如围城，墙外的人想进来，墙内的人麻木不仁。各种项目方都在许~~承~~诺项目可以给持有者带来多大的利益而却忽视了NFT的艺术~~用心制作NFT~~和创新。甚至不少项目方匿名卷钱跑路，这对NFT是一个好的发展吗？或者说如果持续下去，NFT的市场还有什么意义和炒作的价值吗。如果NFT不寻求突破性的发展，而是保持发图卷钱跑路三连操作甚至会受到各国政府的监管打压。\n\nRebels创始人nass在推特上不止一次的对这类项目的各种情况做出了批判。\n\n[https://twitter.com/nassyweazy/status/1524404256836661248?s=20&t=_oOx2HxOuQGsZwkyjV5EFg](https://twitter.com/nassyweazy/status/1524404256836661248?s=20&t=_oOx2HxOuQGsZwkyjV5EFg)\n\nNass认为NFT就应该保持区块链去中心化的精神，以保持更好的公平性。\n\n[https://twitter.com/nassyweazy/status/1480675700264759297](https://twitter.com/nassyweazy/status/1480675700264759297)\n\n### 背景\n\n从6次的AMA中发现，Nass是个十分有认知的项目发起人，合理利用a16z的资源去帮助他成功是这个项目最终能成功的一大助力。另一个我十分欣赏的地方在于，Nass有参考之前的项目，解析项目代码去改进。Nass：“我们分析了BAYC的合约，发现他们并没有优化transfer函数，我们通过分析他们的项目从而改善我们的合约”。目前很多NFT项目都发生了严重的合约问题，尽管很多问题都已有解决方案，可是很多项目依旧照犯了。 对比Nass和其他项目创始人，我们可以看到，强大的背景带来的不只是技术，还有对历史的尊重。**借鉴历史**，**从历史学习。**\n\n### 共识\n\n在加密领域之中共识的地位举足轻重，一个项目的价值取决于其是否有着良好的共识机制，共识又取决于价值，而目前大多数NFT项目的共识仅来自于地板价。但是，价值并不仅仅局限于资金价值，信息知识和人脉这些间接但是持久的价值也是不可忽略的，Rebels里面的成员通过知识共享建立了一个类似技术论坛的社区空间，每周二会举办分享会，亦或是每天早上/晚上的复盘。这些聊天内容实际上给Rebels成员提供了特别的价值。Rebels的中文社区尝试帮助新加入的NFT新人实现从0到1的转变。\n\n### 激励\n\n在NFT中，很多人买一个NFT图片当做头像。不只是为了好看喜欢，更多的是想对别人展现你NFT的价值。NFTs是一个集美学、赞助、地位、收藏和社交的混合资产。就拿BAYC持有者来说，通常此类持有者同时也会是其他的蓝筹持有者。但是目前的PFP功能受限于单个NFTs的展出。当然有多个NFT展示的方法，例如半分法的融合，但是此类NFT便无法通过NFT审核和认证。Rebels此时便可以成为这个桥梁去链接不同的NFT社区，让用户可以展示自己的持有或是热爱的图。\n\n我认为财务价值的主要形式有两种。\n\n* 第一个是团队可以控制的，是创建人们想要使用的产品。第二种方式是社区为人们创造参与的理由\n* 第二个则是运动。人们参加运动是因为他们喜欢这项运动。体育运动的副产品可以是健康和社会效益。人们可能会加入后者，但这项运动是核心。\n\n![这个是Ohhshiny特制的Rebels NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UHPr4gpVLNJQKfFxXji5W.png?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n### 玩法分析\n\n定制化的玩法是很有趣的想法，透过定制化用户不在受制于单个头像，以~~一个~~头像加徽章的方式可以向其他人展现持有者参与的其他项目或是持有的其他NFT。徽章也有很多很多可能性：~~，~~NFT on NFT 直接的提供了二创以及衍生的可能性；~~，~~一个艺术家未来可能不一定需要在Opensea发布NFT转而制作徽章系列，类似社交媒体的表情包系列；~~。~~亦或是~~或者~~透过某个徽章，成员可以去自发的组建subDAO。\n\n在最近的思考和交流中，社区内成员提出成就概念。如今有很多项目会发放POAP，POAP的核心概念很像传统游戏中的成就。那么我们是否可以延展成就系统，一种成就是传统的POAP，另一种成就是基于初始持有者，例如持有时间超过500天，项目方便会发放一个钻石手的成就。因此徽章不会局限于一部分内容，可能性是更多的。\n\n## RebelsLabs\n\n> Rebels Labs是NFT项目Rebels中文社区所提出的subDAO概念。\n\n### 理念\n\n其理念在于最大化利用Rebels独创的徽章系统的潜力，将徽章转换成广告位，从而实现广告产业从web2到web3的转变。当每一个Rebels持有者都佩戴着某个项目的徽章时，我们的原生流量估算在7k左右，通过7k持有者分散传播进而引导社交裂变，从而形成web3独有的病毒式宣传方式。\n\nRebels Labs可提供以下几种营销服务\n\n* Rebels Labs的网站将会展示所有合作伙伴的项目介绍及内部调研，将有一个评分系统，将项目进行评级，从而为项目进行宣传。\n* Rebels Labs的官方Twitter进行Giveaway形式的宣传。\n* 所有Rebels Labs成员将进行转推，转推成功后将获得相对应的代币或者积分进行奖励。\n* 将由NFT领域经验丰富的团队专属定制新兴NFT项目的广告、营销策略、宣发模式等。\n* 可以为发售结束的NFT项目进行实体周边的定制，这是Rebels Labs背靠全球轻工业巨头——中国所拥有的天然优势。\n\nRebels Labs将“球衣广告位”为蓝本，力求在Web3世界中绘制一副更为宏伟的广告蓝图。\n\nRebels Labs也不仅仅局限于广告，也将为NFT项目进行营销咨询的服务，真正做到，让每一位艺术家都可以大胆放肆得去挥毫泼墨，而营销运营我们将为其处理，从而使创作者得到更多的收益。\n\n### 优势\n\nRebels Labs的优势：将成为一辆不断在NFT领域内运行的地铁，每一位NFT旅程中的乘客都可以在这辆地铁上看到不同的广告。我们的优势在于，每一位Rebels Labs的成员的Twitte账号都会有大量的NFT相关的内容，而看到我们广告的人群，也将会是有大部分的NFT玩家，所以我们的广告投放将会极富有针对性，这便是Rebels Labs广告的优势所在。\n\n倘若Rebels成为蓝筹，那么每个独立叛军的胸口将会成为NFT的时代广场。这将是一块尚未开垦的处女地，在Web3世界当中，尚未有一个完整且成功的广告公司，而Rebels Labs将填补这块空缺！\n\n## 最后结语\n\n最后我想感谢 @lunatic, @neken.eth, @唐古特牧羊人，@travy~~臭小子~~，@皮卡星，@冰墩墩，@June，@youyu，@ALAN， @anni。还有所有的社区小伙伴，因为大家努力才能使社区进步。\n\n我还想特别感谢 @[舟舟

It is scarce. 1 of 1. In the case of infringement of your rights as copyright holder, [it can be advantageous to have formally registered the work](https://www.artbusiness.com/register_and_copyright_art_for_artists.html), however the fact remains that digital media is scarce at the point of creation.\n\nThat these critiques often come from corners who mistakenly characterize crypto as a fraudulent fiction is ironic, as the premise that the digital media we enjoy on previous internets is not scarcely owned by anyone is fictitious. No scarcity is being *imposed* on media, existing scarcity is being *surfaced* and experimented with.\n\nThis is the brilliance of the NFT experiment. NFTs represent an elegant proposal to attempt what I would describe as **feasible abundance**. I.e how can we make free media fair for the people creating it?\n\nDecades deep into the internet experiment we had not yet found a way to reconcile our desire to have as many people as possible enjoy media, while also making life financially feasible for the creators of that work. NFTs create games and value exchange around ownership and collection abstracted above access to the content itself, which ought to be available to everyone. As [Jacob.eth articulates](https://cryptomedia.wtf/), the experiment proposes that the more a work is freely available, shared and memed, the more valuable ownership of that work becomes. As such, it is almost impossible to find a piece of NFT art locked behind a token gated wall. In real terms, *meaningful scarcity* would mean withholding that access.\n\nThis premise also explains why many of the most celebrated early NFT auctions from within the Ethereum community were held to retroactively compensate popular memes, from [Nyan Cat](https://foundation.app/@NyanCat/foundation/219) to [Disaster Girl](https://foundation.app/@DisasterGirl/foundation/25046). The values put forward by many corners of the NFT community are that media ought to be freely available, and that free media ought to be valuable. Information is now free *and* expensive. To achieve both states to the satisfaction of all parties at this immature stage is a minor miracle and to be celebrated.\n\nThis accomplishment is made possible through experimentation with previously hidden dynamics, and foregrounding them can be startling to those who were not previously aware of their existence. I call this phenomenon **the shock of the nude**.\n\nMany critics of crypto and NFTs mistakenly suggest that crypto is introducing financialization, inequity or scarcity to our digital lives. This is false. Public blockchains, through making visible latent forces such as financing, unequal returns, or scarce and valuable ownership, are bringing long existing dynamics to the surface to be scrutinized. These forces are not *new*, they are *nude*.\n\nOur previous internet lives are financialized daily on interfaces most of us do not have access to. Web 2 has concentrated wealth and attention to a handful of players at the top (who often most dutifully serve the objectives and accept the universal terms of a handful of platforms), but few other than professional insiders *have seen* the full extent to which this is true.\n\nWhat often emerges on twitter is people with a casual, idealistic, fan-side relationship with media condescending those with a longstanding commitment and understanding of their respective industries. This gulf in knowledge becomes apparent when critics are invited to propose their own alternatives to the current state of the web for creators, with highly RTable but practically infeasible ideas ranging from [laborious illegible key exchanges on a private database](https://blog.mollywhite.net/digital-artists-post-bubble-hopes-for-nfts-dont-need-a-blockchain/) (i.e like a blockchain but way worse) to [vague allusions to revive failed state based internets from 50 years ago](https://reallifemag.com/reconnected/). These ideas sound nice to an equally inexperienced crowd, but are unserious and do not stand to help anyone but their authors. If only things were so easy!\n\nAn unsurprising byproduct of a web modeled to facilitate advertising, it is often quite difficult to discern between solid information and promotional misdirection on Web 2.  There is a significant discrepancy between the statistics the public has access to and the hard financial and industrial realities obscured by them.\n\nIn the arts, the followers and stream numbers we see are a very distorted indicator of how well the person in question is doing financially, and say little of how people actually make a living. Due to tired dynamics of self promotion and brand construction encouraged by web 2 platforms, there is little incentive for anyone to disclose that they are struggling or in a precarious position. Crypto’s public ledgers shatter illusions and hold potential of unveiling sobering truths. **Web 2 is the grift.** **Web 3 is a gift**. It is not morally sound to accept that many people are committing their 20s and 30s to participating in a fiction while silently struggling, adrift of access to good information.\n\nOnly once the warts-and-all truth is made visible do we have any hope of addressing how the world actually works. The shock of the nude may be a cold shower, but a dose of reality is far more useful to practicing artists or internet denizens than a fictitious understanding of  the web and creative industries. Access to more accurate information outside of the promotional mirage of likes and follows is an uncontroversial good for anyone aspiring to make a living.\n\nThat said, while public ledgers make it quite difficult for many to pretend that things are going better than they actually are, there is no shortage of illusion creation on public blockchains too. For a minority who have the means, it is possible to distort perceptions by illicitly pumping bags, making anonymous acquisitions and the like. **Public ledgers are no panacea**, however I find it far preferable that such coordinated distortions be legible and open to scrutiny. As discussed [in our podcast with Context.app](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/making-web3-human-legible-constructive-speculation-and-the-shock-of-the-nude-with-context), more tools are being built to make on-chain activity human legible.\n\nIt will become harder and harder over time to get away with as new forms of journalism are made possible through the ability to track foul play, even retroactively. As [Taylor Monahan recently suggested on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1532085029857284101?s=20&t=UeymocOPtyFVEUOwwmhR8A), so far often the best policing of foul play in crypto has come from within crypto itself, and that accountability will spread as more learn how to read on-chain activity.\n\nYou can follow me [@matdryhurst](http://twitter.com/matdryhurst) on twitter\n\nWe discuss matters like this with wonderful guests weekly [on the Interdependence podcast](https://interdependence.fm/)", "timestamp": 1654274950, "digest": "_sXRcv5Mvc_2__hnfJ4WdNaoxSuqycV-TZKHYFXr1FQ", "contributor": "0xB1F6C97F4D2FEBa6b128F7B6D364E1ED1dca0b99"}

Por eso como inversores es importante identificar proyectos con fuentes de ingresos reales.\n\nEs necesario conocer de donde provienen los ingresos que luego generan los APR.\n\nAlgunos ejemplos de son:\n\n* **Comisiones de trading/swap**\n\nSon tarifas pagadas por quienes intercambian activos en un pool de liquidez (LP)\nEstas tarifas van a quienes proporcionan liquidez (tokens) a estos pooles.\n\nLos LPs obtienen su APR de:\n\n1. Inyección de recompensas (insostenible)\n2. Tarifas comerciales (reales)\n\nCuando el APR proviene de la porción de inyección de recompensas (excesiva emisión de tokens) estas se financian a través de la inflación simbólica y no son sostenibles. No hay ingresos externos que respalden estas recompensas.\n\nLas tarifas comerciales son ingresos reales. Los usuarios pagan una comisión por la utilización de los LPs. Uniswap es un ejemplo de esto, las recompensas no va a los tenedores del token $UNI, todo se distribuye a quienes aportan a los LP.\n\n* **Tarifas de protocolo** \n\nEstas son tarifas pagadas a un protocolo a cambio de brindar un servicio. Por ejemplo los bridges mueven fondos de una cadena a otra y cobran a los usuarios por este servicio.\n\n* **Interés por préstamo** \n\nLos intereses de los prestatarios también son ingresos reales, pero la mayor parte va a los prestamistas.  La ganancia real que el protocolo conserva y comparte con los poseedores de tokens se calcula: Interés de los prestatarios menos el interés pagado a los prestamistas.\n\nHasta acá ingresos reales, con los que se pagan los rendimientos a los inversores. Pero hay protocolos que usan otras estrategias más deficientes para ofrecer mejores ganancias.\n\nVeamos ejemplos de ingresos insostenibles.\n\n* **Yield farming incentivados en LP**\n\nLos yield farming son solo tokens que se imprimen y distribuyen a costa de la inflación. Las recompensas por la emisión de nuevos tokens no son un rendimiento \"real\". Potencialmente, puede ganar dinero de ellos mediante el farming y el dumping a corto plazo, pero no son fuentes de rendimiento reales o sostenibles.

{"id": "wNgr_gu1F5aanrW3cwBwO1hAg2EB7DWLBrB1O0MsVKs", "title": "Studying the Optimism Collective", "body": "![Optimism Collective Announcement](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Hz5mYJLcQfRc9AlMuHB_TA.png)\n\n***Disclosure: You may already be a winner of the*** ***[$OP token sweepstakes](https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/check). I am serving as a delegate for the Optimism Token House.***\n\nThis week Optimism dropped the $OP token, initiating Optimism Governance. Optimism’s governance system presents an exciting opportunity to study the latest thinking in governance design and helps us focus on shaping the next era of Web3 through its focus on public goods. With the launch of the token, Optimism created the Optimism Collective, an ecosystem that will govern the distribution of public goods funding derived from the revenue the protocol generates. The Optimism Collective is governed by three bodies: the Token House (holders of $OP), the Citizens’ House (select NFT holders), and the Foundation. Optimism’s structure is notable for its balance of power between the three governing bodies, the use of multiple voting styles (token-weighted and one-person, one-vote), and the Collective’s commitment to experimentation.\n\n*What is Optimism?*\n\nOptimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is an optimistic rollup: it is optimistic, because it assumes transactions submitted to it by users are valid; it is a rollup, because it sequences transactions off of Ethereum and periodically submits a merkle root of the transactions to Ethereum to create a resulting state change. Given that Optimism’s sequencer does not ensure the same security as Ethereum, Optimism creates a dispute period after its sequencer publishes a batch of transactions, during which a party can challenge a state change with a fault proof (for a reward) which will prevent the state change from being committed to Ethereum. Optimism is the first layer 2 to achieve EVM equivalence, meaning that there is no difference between how smart contracts are executed on L2 and L1, which makes deployment on Optimism easier.\n\n*The Optimism Collective — Mission*\n\nThe Optimism Collective is guided by a vision of “sustainably fund\\[ing\\] those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond.” In essence, Optimism is devoting protocol revenue tokenholders and trusted stewards of the community to fund public goods projects that create compounding value for Optimism and eventually Web3 and broader society. The Collective was created with a view toward making public goods creation profitable, meaning “impact=profit.” The Collective seeks to achieve its mission by funding public goods both proactively and retroactively. Proactive funding encourages innovation and risk-taking in the pursuit of public goods; retroactive funding ensures that impactful projects are rewarded.\n\n*Balance of Powers*\n\nOptimism seeks to balance the short-term and long-term views of the community by balancing power between the Token House, the Citizens’ House, and the Foundation.\n\n![Optimism Governance Overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*V9XR86iMDooYoZBg.jpeg)\n\nThe Token House is entrusted to make determinations about project incentives, protocol upgrades, and the appropriation of treasury funds to the Foundation. By leveraging the collective knowledge of the Token House, the Collective is able to improve the predictive power of its grants and adjust to the specific needs of the Optimism community. The democratic aspect of the Token House ensures that the users of the protocol have representation in determining the future of the protocol’s mission and function.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will focus on retroactive public goods funding. Citizens will be selected from the community; their citizenship is non-transferrable. By selecting individuals who have demonstrated value to the Optimism ecosystem, the Collective will increase the likelihood that retroactive funding represents true value provided to the community. Having a consistency of identity creates continuity in criteria and makes long-term decision-making possible.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is the steward of the Collective. It oversees the administration of governance, allocates treasury assets (including the distribution of $OP), vetoes malicious proposals, and has the power to amend the Constitution. The Foundation has many stabilizing powers for the community, yet its capabilities remain in check by the Token House. The Token House can remove directors from the Foundation and veto changes to the founding documents that would materially impair tokenholders’ rights.\n\n*Mixed Voting*\n\nThe Token House and Citizens’ House have different forms of voting to suit different functions. The Token House votes on a token-weighted basis. As in any token-weighted system, Token House voting is susceptible to plutocratic concentration of power and voter apathy. The Token House permits tokenholders to delegate their votes to stewards who have made public commitments to act as stewards for the Collective. Delegation may mitigate the power of individual holders who have high concentrations of power by enabling smaller holders to pool their votes through a delegate. Delegation also ensures that there are members of the community who are dedicated to participating in governance, mitigating the chance that small groups can collude to pass self-interested proposals with a quorum.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will operate through a one-person, one-vote system. Citizens are ultimately expected to be chosen through deliberation between the Token House and the Citizens’ House. Given that Citizens are chosen based on their specific insights, the one-person, one-vote structure is sensible: newly minted citizens will have equal footing with incumbents for decision-making.\n\nBringing a token-weighted system together with a one-person, one-vote system creates a balance between the short-term and the long-term as well as between the prospective and retroactive. Both Houses come together to determine the Optimism network parameters, which affects the balance between transaction volume on the Optimism network and funding supply for retroactive public goods funding. This balance keeps the present and future health of the protocol fairly represented: tokenholders are not unfairly called upon to subsidize large-scale infrastructural projects, while citizens have a voice in projecting long-term funding needs to improve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n*Experimentation*\n\nOptimism’s Working Constitution is brief, but the first principle is “a commitment to experimentation.” Projects that have a need for a complex beginning also have a need for flexibility. At the point of initiation, the Optimism community can only match an understanding of their needs with governance theory and the knowledge of how other DAOs have succeeded and failed. To ensure the success of the governance process, the community needs to commit to a flexible system in order to test theory with community-specific data. By focusing on experimentation, Optimism will collect important data on what principles and rules best suit the mission of funding public goods and use that data to create a better fit between the Collective’s mission and its procedure.\n\nEarly experimentation mitigates path-dependency. By maintaining a commitment to testing theories, the community encourages honesty about the value of the governance systems it tries. A collective mindset of flexibility also encourages the community to innovate, as the cost of failure is lowered and the value of the data collected is high.

I am serving as a delegate for the Optimism Token House.***\n\nThis week Optimism dropped the $OP token, initiating Optimism Governance. Optimism’s governance system presents an exciting opportunity to study the latest thinking in governance design and helps us focus on shaping the next era of Web3 through its focus on public goods. With the launch of the token, Optimism created the Optimism Collective, an ecosystem that will govern the distribution of public goods funding derived from the revenue the protocol generates. The Optimism Collective is governed by three bodies: the Token House (holders of $OP), the Citizens’ House (select NFT holders), and the Foundation. Optimism’s structure is notable for its balance of power between the three governing bodies, the use of multiple voting styles (token-weighted and one-person, one-vote), and the Collective’s commitment to experimentation.\n\n*What is Optimism?*\n\nOptimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is an optimistic rollup: it is optimistic, because it assumes transactions submitted to it by users are valid; it is a rollup, because it sequences transactions off of Ethereum and periodically submits a merkle root of the transactions to Ethereum to create a resulting state change. Given that Optimism’s sequencer does not ensure the same security as Ethereum, Optimism creates a dispute period after its sequencer publishes a batch of transactions, during which a party can challenge a state change with a fault proof (for a reward) which will prevent the state change from being committed to Ethereum. Optimism is the first layer 2 to achieve EVM equivalence, meaning that there is no difference between how smart contracts are executed on L2 and L1, which makes deployment on Optimism easier.\n\n*The Optimism Collective — Mission*\n\nThe Optimism Collective is guided by a vision of “sustainably fund\\[ing\\] those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond.” In essence, Optimism is devoting protocol revenue tokenholders and trusted stewards of the community to fund public goods projects that create compounding value for Optimism and eventually Web3 and broader society. The Collective was created with a view toward making public goods creation profitable, meaning “impact=profit.” The Collective seeks to achieve its mission by funding public goods both proactively and retroactively. Proactive funding encourages innovation and risk-taking in the pursuit of public goods; retroactive funding ensures that impactful projects are rewarded.\n\n*Balance of Powers*\n\nOptimism seeks to balance the short-term and long-term views of the community by balancing power between the Token House, the Citizens’ House, and the Foundation.\n\n![Optimism Governance Overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*V9XR86iMDooYoZBg.jpeg)\n\nThe Token House is entrusted to make determinations about project incentives, protocol upgrades, and the appropriation of treasury funds to the Foundation. By leveraging the collective knowledge of the Token House, the Collective is able to improve the predictive power of its grants and adjust to the specific needs of the Optimism community. The democratic aspect of the Token House ensures that the users of the protocol have representation in determining the future of the protocol’s mission and function.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will focus on retroactive public goods funding. Citizens will be selected from the community; their citizenship is non-transferrable. By selecting individuals who have demonstrated value to the Optimism ecosystem, the Collective will increase the likelihood that retroactive funding represents true value provided to the community. Having a consistency of identity creates continuity in criteria and makes long-term decision-making possible.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is the steward of the Collective. It oversees the administration of governance, allocates treasury assets (including the distribution of $OP), vetoes malicious proposals, and has the power to amend the Constitution. The Foundation has many stabilizing powers for the community, yet its capabilities remain in check by the Token House. The Token House can remove directors from the Foundation and veto changes to the founding documents that would materially impair tokenholders’ rights.\n\n*Mixed Voting*\n\nThe Token House and Citizens’ House have different forms of voting to suit different functions. The Token House votes on a token-weighted basis. As in any token-weighted system, Token House voting is susceptible to plutocratic concentration of power and voter apathy. The Token House permits tokenholders to delegate their votes to stewards who have made public commitments to act as stewards for the Collective. Delegation may mitigate the power of individual holders who have high concentrations of power by enabling smaller holders to pool their votes through a delegate. Delegation also ensures that there are members of the community who are dedicated to participating in governance, mitigating the chance that small groups can collude to pass self-interested proposals with a quorum.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will operate through a one-person, one-vote system. Citizens are ultimately expected to be chosen through deliberation between the Token House and the Citizens’ House. Given that Citizens are chosen based on their specific insights, the one-person, one-vote structure is sensible: newly minted citizens will have equal footing with incumbents for decision-making.\n\nBringing a token-weighted system together with a one-person, one-vote system creates a balance between the short-term and the long-term as well as between the prospective and retroactive. Both Houses come together to determine the Optimism network parameters, which affects the balance between transaction volume on the Optimism network and funding supply for retroactive public goods funding. This balance keeps the present and future health of the protocol fairly represented: tokenholders are not unfairly called upon to subsidize large-scale infrastructural projects, while citizens have a voice in projecting long-term funding needs to improve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n*Experimentation*\n\nOptimism’s Working Constitution is brief, but the first principle is “a commitment to experimentation.” Projects that have a need for a complex beginning also have a need for flexibility. At the point of initiation, the Optimism community can only match an understanding of their needs with governance theory and the knowledge of how other DAOs have succeeded and failed. To ensure the success of the governance process, the community needs to commit to a flexible system in order to test theory with community-specific data. By focusing on experimentation, Optimism will collect important data on what principles and rules best suit the mission of funding public goods and use that data to create a better fit between the Collective’s mission and its procedure.\n\nEarly experimentation mitigates path-dependency. By maintaining a commitment to testing theories, the community encourages honesty about the value of the governance systems it tries. A collective mindset of flexibility also encourages the community to innovate, as the cost of failure is lowered and the value of the data collected is high. If early rules are rigid, systems may proceed despite inefficiencies and flaws in the early design, and the longer the flaws linger, the more difficult it becomes to remedy them in the future.\n\nThe results of the Collective’s experiments will be public goods in themselves.

Of nothingness. Of worthlessness. Of watching my love reject me again with a smile and a dance.\n\nIt’s not just a rejection of *oh we’re just not good together.* It’s deeper. Rejection to the core.

{"id": "CjGLCh_MDJbqrPWab5LXaiUtzmFPsRlV23nuyKhLjzI", "title": "Tokenomics | Part 1", "body": "## What are Tokenomics? \n\nTokenomics can be described as the economics of how cryptocurrencies work, just like banks & governments have monetary policy to control fiat currencies (currencies issued by governments that aren’t backed by any commodity such as gold or silver), crypto has tokenomics which anyone is able to view in order to guess if the token has any chance to succeed.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1nhb_lZdwXid_F1liYxsm.jpeg?height=2111&width=1813)\n\n## Why \n\nWhy is it important to know about tokenomics… Well, most of the time it’s a good idea to know you want to understand where your hard-earned money is going, how it will be used and how the processes operate, just like if you order food at a restaurant you like to see the menu and what goes into the meal.\n\nUnless you’re a full degen and choose to ape in or YOLO all your money into the next hyped shit coin, pump & dump, blatant ponzi schemes or pensions funds managed by someone who care more about their fees than your portfolio. 👀\n\nThis is why you might hear people say things like “So what’s the tokenomics, the supply, market cap, ect.“ when talking about new tokens or/and projects and that makes sense, you should know what ~~you’re throwing your money at~~ investing in.\n\nIMO some good basic questions to ask are:\n\n* How many coins exist?\n* How many coins will be added (how & when)?\n* Is the supply inflationary (increasing) or deflationary (decreasing)?\n* wHaT iS tHe uTiLiTy, which is a very sensible an fair question, for example, can they be used for more than just trading or can they be staked, ect.?\n* Is there a real-world use case?\n* Who are the whales (who owns the majority of tokens)?\n* Is the distribution spread out or concentrated?\n\nThis is just them asking how it works, so they can figure out if it’s a project that they see as valuable for the short term or/and long term - There’s quite a bit to unwrap so I’ll try to explain it as best as I can.\n\n## With those questions in mind, I’ll focus on x6 areas:\n\n* Supply\n* Demand\n* Distribution & Allocation\n* Market Cap\n* Deflationary vs. Inflationary\n* ROI (Return on interest)\n* Roadmap\n* Where are the builders\n\n## Supply\n\nThis just means that how many tokens there are in total.\n\n* Circulating: How many tokens are currently available or/and in use. A slow & steady increase of the circulating supply can be positive, meaning there is active mining hence activity in the project, so you could expect the token value to increase. However if too many tokens are released quickly or/and too often, then that could effect the price negatively.\n* Total: Circulating tokens minus burned tokens (tokens that are permanently removed from circulation by being sent to a wallet address that can’t be accessed, so those tokens are lost).\n* Maximum: The total number of tokens that can ever be produced, some tokens have a max supply such as BTC whereas others don’t have a max supply like ETH.\n\n## Demand\n\nThis means how many people want the token.\n\n* Simple supply & demand, if there is a high demand for the token but a small supply then it’s logical to assume the price would rise. Vice versa, if there is too much supply and not enough demand then the price may fall.\n\n## Distribution & Allocation\n\nHow the token is shared and the spread out amongst the holders. It’s important to make sure that the tokens distributed fairly and that the holders don’t have a large percentage or it could be a sign of whales who could easily manipulate the market and cause pump & dump scenarios.\n\n* Pre-mined: A select group are granted tokens before they’re offered to the public on public sale, these groups can be the developers, team, private investors & VC’s.\n* Fair launch: Everyone has access to the tokens at the same time/price.\n\n## Market Cap\n\nCan be used to indicated token value, popularity & size of the token.\n\n* Current price x circulating supply = Market cap\n* High market cap but low circulating supply has potential to increase over time.\n\n## Deflationary vs. Inflationary\n\nThis means is the token gaining or loosing value. Can be used to indicated token value, popularity & size of the token.\n\n* Deflationary: Has a maximum supply, for example with BTC there is a max limit of 21 million BTC that can be mined & brought into circulation.\n* Inflationary: No maximum supply, such as Dogecoin.\n\n## ROI (Return on interest)\n\nHow much cashflow or income a token can create\n\n* This can be done in different ways, which includes staking, liquidity pools, being a validator for the network, etc.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThis is a plan for the project, it can come as a pitchdeck or whitepaper, ect.\n\n* Addressing current challenges and anticipating future challenges, do they already have solutions and/or are they currently working on solutions?\n\n## Where are the builders\n\nBasically, is the project growing, plateauing or shrinking.\n\n* Does the project or ecosystem have a lot of activity from people working in the space to build, develop and/or grow. If there are, you can assume that’s a positive sign for the project to improve *(& hopefully the price to follow)*.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wcOjh9wYcKJZUUkT8RIii.png?height=1450&width=1446)\n\nI hope that made sense and was clear, or at least gave you a slightly better idea of what tokenomics are, hopefully, you can use your newfound knowledge to research & avoid YOLO’ing all of your savings into the next x1000 token that you found on reddit …\n\nNext, we’ll check out & compare the tokenomics of BTC & ETH.", "timestamp": 1654276581, "digest": "dg3o4792yl-KVtHuUIiTbPmsGfoN4JJz967oHXyI5k4", "contributor": "0xd40C1F4242D17023Fa4894812Ee7563124b27C66"}

{"id": "ZnzuFm1dy84Ua4DjqhDtxPKexwQUUgnOsmCDgHaI2C8", "title": "The Efficacy of YouTube in Autodidactic 10th Grade ELA Instruction\n", "body": "The purpose of this study was to examine students' attitudes and abilities to teach themselves academic content using YouTube in a 10th Grade English Language Arts classroom. It was conducted over a course of four-weeks and analyzed quantitative data in the form of a survey and test scores to test the efficacy of YouTube in a formal learning environment. The demographic makeup of this study consisted of twenty-seven participants from a highly-diverse and urban Title 1 school. \n\nThis study found that students’ attitudes towards YouTube may not determine their ability to use it for learning successfully in the classroom and that YouTube could be equally as effective as teacher lecture in delivering standards-based instruction. For this reason, the lecture-test model in education should be heavily scrutinized as it does not utilize 21st Century technology to its full advantage. Educators should focus their classroom on media literacy (finding credible sources online, utilizing new technologies, and teaching oneself using the Internet) as students will need to be lifelong learners to remain competitive in the future economy. It is recommended that future research test the efficacy of emerging technologies in the classroom.** \n **\n\n**Chapter 1**\n\nStatement of the Problem\n\nThe advent of YouTube was revolutionary for mankind and its popularization could potentially change the face of education, forever, “students can potentially download and stream media wherever and whenever they like, affording great flexibility in learning experiences, and potentially de-tether learning from the bricks and mortar university classroom” (Thomson, Bridgestock, Willems, 2014).  Colleges have increasingly embraced online/distance learning and reaped the financial and logistical benefits of its approach. What effects of this paradigm shift will trickle down to high school ELA instruction? This must be examined, as it is imperative that secondary school curriculum  promote media literacy in preparation for further education (McLoughlin & Lee, 2010). Retention and persistence in online courses is an issue in higher education because students must self-motivate and self-educate (Douglas, 2010). For this reason, using online sources, such as YouTube, to teach oneself has become an essential skill in collegiate online learning and should be taught early in a student’s career.\n\nThe future economy will be highly automated and technologically driven; it is estimated that sixty-five percent of present K-12 students will work jobs that do not exist yet (“The Future of Jobs”, 2016, p. 3).  In order to stay competitive in an automated and globalized economy, it will be necessary for students to teach themselves new concepts and adapt to new environments as they become obsolete . Educators should redirect their curriculum to reflect this reality by preparing students for lifelong learning outside of academia through integrating technology into the classroom (McLoughlin & Lee, 2010, p. 38).  YouTube is a possible means to meet such cyclical demands as it is low-cost, exhaustive, and easy-to-use.  \n\n Educators should integrate emerging technologies which prove more cost-effective, relevant, and efficient than traditional methods into their instruction with the intention of decreasing cost of services and increasing student engagement. Although not in the interest of career educators or educational institutions, this should be a goal of a democratic and equitable society-- where all people, regardless of income, are able to receive a high-quality education for little to no cost. \n\n**Purpose of the Study**\n\nAuto-didacticism through YouTube is happening all across the world, but its efficacy has only been briefly studied. It is possible that people could become well-versed in a subject using YouTube alone, completely outside of an educational institution. \n\nNew technologies are transforming the way people learn. Online learning has become very popular in higher education and is slowly finding its way into high school curriculums. In online learning situations, YouTube videos are often utilized to supplement or replace teacher lecture. Teachers use it because it is accessible, free, current, and if the source is credible, reliable, and students love the platform because it gives them autonomy, diverse perspectives, and the ability to engage on their own schedule.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine students' attitudes and ability to teach themselves difficult concepts through YouTube, and test the efficacy of their approach. This study will explore how students discover information with this democratic, omnipresent, and easily accessible medium.\n\n**Significance of the Study**\n\nSelf-directed online learning requires little resources: anyone with a device connected to the Internet has the ability to educate themselves. It is possible that someone in a Third World country with access to the Internet could access a high-quality education for practically free. Autodidacticism through YouTube could be used as a means to advance one’s career or self-pursuits after graduation, regardless of socioeconomic status. This is a revolutionary concept. \n\nThe sheer amount of information published on the web is enormous. Gonzalez (2004), as cited in Seimens (2005), explains, “the amount of knowledge in the world has doubled in the past 10 years and is doubling every 18 months.” Human advancements in knowledge, about practically everything, is an overwhelming behemoth (Garrett-Wright, Abell, 2011). It is humanly impossible for educators to teach their students everything, and YouTube is an outlet for both parties to stay informed on emerging information. \n\n**Theoretical/Conceptual Framework**\n\nThis study is built mainly upon Connectivism, which states that access to information is more important than the information itself, and that “real-life learning is messy and complex” (Siemens, 2005, p. 5).  Connectivism builds upon on the idea that the Internet can be utilized to share knowledge and that people learn by building upon their prior knowledge in sometimes non-linear ways. \n\nBandura’s (1977) Social Learning Theory is a theory that states that people learn from observing others and replicating their behaviors. Effective modeling and reproduction by the viewer is a method in which humans learn.  Reproducing what has been modeled is inextricable aspect of the human experience. People can learn by watching others perform tasks on YouTube.\n\nBruner’s (1961) Discovery Learning Theory holds the idea that people learn best by discovering information themselves. When humans are given a problem and asked to solve it, humans rise to the occasion by exploring possibilities, wrestling difficult concepts, and arriving at conclusions. The discovery learning process allows for mistakes and insufficiencies because overcoming obstacles leads to increased motivation, creativity, and learning. Students teaching themselves through YouTube could potentially be more effective than a teacher leading students through a prescribed curriculum. \n\n**Research Questions**\n\nThe following questions were examined in this study: \n\n1\\.) Is there a positive correlation between a student’s confidence level in self-guided online learning and their use of YouTube to master a specific-skill (i.e. grammar usage/mechanics) in 10th grade ELA instruction?\n\n2\\.) How proficient are 10th grade students, on a skill-based assessment, at self-educating via YouTube versus traditional instruction?\n\n**Hypotheses**\n\nIt is hypothesized that students will value flexibility in their learning and feel alienated by the current high school educational system and traditional “sage on a stage” student-teacher relationships (Prensky, 2008). They appreciate the freedom in a “go figure it out” approach and find this learning process relevant to their daily lives. Teaching themselves feels natural because Generation Z teachers themselves with technology outside of school. It is also hypothesized that the majority of  students will be able to teach themselves grammar usage and mechanics with YouTube effectively, regardless of proclaimed confidence level. \n\n**Delimitations**\n\nThis study tested a small sample size, and was reflective of a very specific diverse Title 1 student body. Not all students in this study had cell phones or immediate access to the Internet at home due to cultural or financial limitations. It is plausible that these students do not interact with technology in the same manner that those who do always have access. Students may encounter difficulties and not persevere, because they have been taught how to use technology for academic purposes.\n\nLiterature Search Procedures\n\nUsing Google Trends, this researcher searched for “YouTube how to” to analyze if people were interested in using YouTube to teach themselves. The results yielded a steady increase in interest in teaching oneself via YouTube over the course of around twelve years and, as Figure 1 indicates, an extremely high interest (almost 100%) since 2012.\n\nMark Prensky’s, a leader and visionary in technology in education, research was heavily examined for this study. He coined the terms, “digital natives” and “digital immigrants” (Prensky, 2001, p. 1), which will referenced throughout this study. His work begs educators to adapt to the modern world through the use of technology.\n\nArticles from JStor were found regarding the effects of technology on psychology and the brain.  ProQuest was used to find dissertations, which were very specific and relevant to this topic. A simple Google search for credible, academic writing on this issue proved highly effective as well.\n\n**Definition of Terms**\n\nThe following terms will be used in the present action research study:\n\n*ELA:* English Language Arts\n\n*Autodidacticism:* Self-directed online learning \n\n*Digital Native:* a person who has been connected to the Internet for the entirety of their life  (Prensky, 2001, p. 1).\n\n*Digital Immigrant:* a person who lived in the era before personal computing. This person knows “about” technology, but is not fully immersed in its domain (Prensky, 2001, p. 2). \n\n***Chapter 2*** \n\n**Findings from Literature Review**\n\nYouTube is a major player in the Information Age. It has billions of users (Bloom & Johnston, 2010, p. 113), accounts for hundreds of millions of hours of watch time and billions of views each day, has local versions in 76 different languages, and covers 95% of the world’s population. The average time spent on YouTube is forty minutes, and the average amount of video posted to YouTube per minute is 300 hours (“YouTube Statistics,” 2016). With this daily exponential expansion, it is possible that YouTube could become an essential part of the educational system (Fleck, Beckman, Sterns, & Hussey, 2014, p. 23). \n\n**Live vs. Online Instruction**\n\nFiglio, Rush, & Yin (2010) were the self-proclaimed first group to study the efficacy of online instruction versus live instruction. They found that live instruction showed a modest,  almost negligible, increase in learning on a standardized tests. However, the researchers did find a discrepancy in participants whom were Hispanic, male, and low-achieving. Figlio, Rush, & Yin (2010), concluded that online instruction may prove effective for traditional students; however, “students from different language backgrounds, experience or motivation levels might have different experiences in live versus Internet only settings” (p.13).\n\nIn a later study, Driscoll, Jícha, Hunt, Tichavsky, & Gretchen (2012) studied satisfaction and success in a university level Sociology course in online versus F2F (face-to-face) scenarios.  The professor taught the exact same material online and in a traditional classroom. The researchers found similar results to that of  Figlio, Rush, & Yin (2010) stating that, online education is only effective when designed correctly (Driscoll et. al., 2012, 323).  When it came to satisfaction, they found that students found each learning online or in a classroom was equally satisfactory. Their consensus, congruent with other studies they reviewed, was that there is no difference in the efficacy of online or classroom learning (p.325). \n\n**Persistence and Autodidactic Online Learning**\n\nSuccessful self-directed learning requires two key elements in order to be successful: an instructional method process and the responsibility and personality of the learner (Svedberg, 2010). Persistence and tenacity is an integral part of autodidacticism, especially in online distance learning. The dropout rates are higher in online programs as opposed to traditional classroom programs (Douglas, 2010). \n\nA measurement tool exists for self-directed learning “readiness,” Guglielmino’s (1978) Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale.  In Svedberg’s (2010) study, students were measured with this scale. The vast majority of students were labeled as “persisters” as opposed to “non-persisters.” However, the results of the study found that students labeled “non-persistent” actually scored higher on an assessment, which befuddled the researcher and contradicted popular learning theories outlined in Svedberg’s dissertation (p.44). \n\nDouglas (2010) also studied persistence in self-directed online learning. His study focused on the correlation of students’ persistence amongst perceived barriers of success in online learning for adults. Similarly to Svedberg (2010), Douglas did not find a correlation between perceived barriers in self-directed learning and participants’ decisions to participate in self-directed learning. Adults were motivated to learn in online environments regardless of their personal situations.  In fact, there was an overwhelming amount of interest amongst adults in autodidactic online learning environments; 84 percent of adults surveyed said that they wished to self-educate online (p. 92). \n\n**Technology and the Brain**\n\nGreenfeld (2016) studied how emerging technologies affect digital natives’ brains. Greenfeld found that Millennials process information differently than their predecessors. Since information is readily available at all times through the Internet; rote memorization is becoming increasingly unnecessary. Greenfeld concludes that technology, “reduces our motivation to acquire new knowledge that dwells in our heads” and that, “parents and teachers need strategies to educate a generation that increasingly believes all relevant knowledge resides online” (p. 342).  \n\nFisher, Goddu, & Keil (2015) studied a person’s ability to use the Internet and their confidence level in answering general knowledge questions. Participants were asked simple questions like, “Why are there leap years?” and “Why are there more women than men?”  When given access to a search engine, the researchers found an increase in participants confidence levels when given access to a search engine, even if their searches were insufficient.  The researchers explained a “transactive” memory exchange with the Internet. Since human memory is highly fallible, humans have began to refer to search engines and, the Internet in general, to access knowledge. However, the participants had an inflated sense of what they knew and displayed an overconfidence in answering questions. \n\n**Millennial Attitudes towards YouTube**\n\nFleck, Beckman, Sterns, & Hussey (2014) studied effective ways to use YouTube in a college-level psychology course.  Their study utilized high-interest and entertaining, yet relevant, YouTube videos in order to teach content.  Their selection included videos from popular culture i.e. Pirates of the Caribbean and Big Bang Theory. When surveyed before the experiment, 80 percent of students said that they found they videos helpful in an academic setting.  In a post-experiment survey, 97.3 percent of students felt that the YouTube videos were useful and aided in learning. There was a positive correlation with students’ attitudes towards YouTube after they experienced how YouTube could be used positively in the curriculum. The study concluded that there were two elements in which the students found most helpful: entertainment and correlation to the curriculum. \n\n**Baby Boomers Attitudes towards YouTube**\n\nThomson, Bridgstock, and Willems (2014) studied the generational attitudes between Baby Boomers and Millennials about using video in the classroom. Baby Boomers, who teach Millennials, may see emerging technology as a distraction and detractor from education, while Millennials see it as a viable means of credible information (Garrett-Wright & Abbell, 2011). This generational divide is a source of friction in the classroom. Attitudes towards emerging technologies heavily affects how teachers use video in the classroom and its efficacy. When veteran teachers create videos, they tend to make them in an online lecture format. However, this is not the most effective way to exploit the medium of video (Thomson, Bridgstock, Willems, 2014).  There is a disconnect between how Baby Boomers and Millennials consume technology, and this may lead to conflicting views on the role of technology in the classroom, and consequently, how to use it in an effective way.  The content within the video must be relevant to the course and the student’s interest (Thomson, Bridgstock, Willems, 2014), (Fleck, Beckman, Sterns, & Hussey, 2014, p. 23). When Baby Boomers are unable to meet these needs through video, their skepticism is confirmed. However, this is not a problem with the student, but rather with the teacher because developing quality videos requires a skill set which often times Baby Boomers do not have (Thomson, Bridgstock, Willems, 2014, p.76).\n\n**Conclusions** \n\nAcademics overwhelming agree on one thing: not enough academic research exists on YouTube or video as a viable means of disseminating information in the classroom (Garrett-Wright & Abbell, 2011); (Thomson, Bridgstock, Willems, 2014); (Greenfeld, 2016); (Svedberg, 2010).  Researchers, academics, and educators realize that education is incongruent with future lifestyles and economy (Bloom & Johnston, 2010).  The process of redefining a modern education exemplar requires cross-generational understanding, feedback, and integration (Garrett-Wright & Abbell, 2011).  There is a technological rift that exists between those who grew up with technology in their households (digital natives) and those which learned to adapt (digital immigrants) (Prensky, 2001), and YouTube may be a tool to mend this schism in the classroom. YouTube is easy to use, ubiquitous, and free (Garrett-Wright & Abbell, 2011).  It is possible that entire courses will one day be based entirely around YouTube, which could make the generational divide in teaching irrelevant. \n\n**Implications for Future Research**\n\nEducators must reconcile traditional pedagogy and modern society. Future research should scrutinize the lecture-test model in education and examine the role of the teacher in the classroom as emerging technologies that may be more cost-effective, relevant, and efficient than traditional education are introduced. \n\nThe efficacy of self-directed online learning is difficult to measure in an online setting. Svedberg’s (2010) studied yielded contradictory results than pontificated: there may not be a correlation between self-motivation and self-directed online learning efficacy. A difficulty cited was the hurdle of getting honest and thoughtful feedback from participants, especially those considered “non-persisters”. Svedberg (2010) also believes that “reading avidity, GPA, how a student connects to the Internet, and work obligations should also be considered in future studies.  Douglas (2010) states that his study could have been improved by taking a larger and truly random sample rather than examining a specific population. \n\nResearchers should examine the use of YouTube in everyday life rather than isolated controlled settings. In a controlled setting YouTube may prove to be highly effective. However, in everyday situations, as Greenfeld (2015) postulates, YouTube may prove to be just another distraction.  Researchers should understand that there is a difference of how students interact with technology in a formal experimental setting rather than browsing at home, where there are an infinite amount of distractions. In order to account for this, researchers could possibly let students multitask while they conduct an experiment to simulate a realistic setting. Or, researchers could use an informal setting while conducting an experiment to extrapolate more convincing results. \n\n**Chapter 3**\n\n**Research Design**\n\nThe design of this research was experimental. Both classes were taught the same topic but were delivered content differently. Students were given three pre/post tests over a span of four weeks.The order of the research experiment was as followed:\n\n1. Students were given an attitudes survey regarding their use of YouTube.\n2. A pretest was administered.    \n3.  Instruction lasted around twenty minutes. The control group received instruction by teacher lecture and the experimental group was given a YouTube playlist to view at their leisure. Instruction in the control group was traditional teacher lecture, whereas the experimental group received instruction by watching YouTube videos in playlists curated by the teacher. In the control group, students were lectured with a PowerPoint presentation\n4. A worksheet was given to students for practice. \n5. A posttest was administered. \n\n Only quantitative data was collected for this experiment because qualitative data was not necessarily relevant to the tested outcomes. The independent variable for this experiment was the method of delivery and the dependent variable was student growth by percentage points.\n\n**Sampling**                                                                                                                                      \n\nThe sample was not random; the classes were based upon scheduling by the school’s administration. Both the control and experiment groups were English II Standard classes of comparable ability level. \n\n**Participants**\n\nThis research was conducted at a Title 1 school in Middle Tennessee. The participants of this study consisted of a highly diverse student body, many of whom were bilingual. There were twenty-two students total. Four students spoke Arabic and fourteen spoke Spanish. There were also two black students and two Asian students.  Four students were enrolled in ELL programs, and one student had an IEP.  Nineteen of these students were in 10th grade and three were registered 12th graders. \n\nThe experimental group consisted of seventeen students.  The majority of students were also bilingual. The class consisted of four Arabic speakers, nine Spanish speakers, three black students and one white student.  Eight students were enrolled in an ELL program and one had an IEP.  Thirteen of the students were in 10th grade and four were registered 12th graders. \n\n**Data Collection**\n\nThe research used an experimental approach of collecting data. Quantitative data was measured to answer the following questions: \n\n1\\.) Is there a positive correlation between a student’s confidence level in self-guided online learning and successful use of YouTube to master a specific-skill (i.e. grammar usage/mechanics) in 10th grade ELA instruction?\n\n2\\.) How proficient are 10th grade students at self-educating, on a skill-based assessment, via YouTube?\n\n**Apparatus or Instruments**\n\nStudents in both the control and experimental group were administered pre/post tests with Kahoot at the end of each class session. Kahoot has been used several times in the classroom before and was familiar to the students. Kahoot was used for ease of use and reliability in data collection. Students used their cell phones or school issued computers to complete the tests.\n\nA survey was given on Google Forms using a Likert scale (1-5) to test students attitudes towards self-directed learning and YouTube before the experiment began. The questions consisted of how comfortable students were with YouTube, teaching themselves, and their attitudes towards utilizing YouTube in a classroom setting. \n\n**Data Analysis**\n\nData was collected in order to test the effectiveness of YouTube as an instructional method in the classroom. The researcher collected and analyzed students’ attitudes towards using YouTube and compared their responses with their average scores on posttests.  Posttest data was also used to compare the efficacy of YouTube in autodidactic instruction to traditional lecture in a 10th grade ELA classroom.\n\n**Ethical Behavior**\n\nThis researcher conducted an ethical study. Parents were given letters of consent forms at the beginning of the study, which were signed and returned to the researcher before any research data was collected. This study did not interfere with the curriculum in any way. All personal information from students was anonymized by assigning students’ names to numerical digits.  The data was kept securely by the researcher.  The school district and name of the school did not appear in any presentation or publication of data. This researcher also realizes that limitations in this study do exist, meaning that it may not be generalized to other populations. \n\n**Chapter 4**\n\n**Pre-Instruction Assessment**\n\nAn attitudes survey was given to all 27 students who participated in the study to determine how students interacted with YouTube. This survey quantified student comfortability levels with the medium, usage amount, general attitudes, and their preferred teaching model \n\n(YouTube vs. lecture vs. hybrid). The researcher did not want to make any assumptions about how students used the platform and was interested in getting a general idea of how students used YouTube, and if they felt it could be used in an academic context. \n\nFigure 3 indicates that the majority of students were “very comfortable” and confident in their ability to teach themselves using YouTube. Zero percent of students responded that they were “not comfortable” whereas forty-eight percent were “very comfortable.” Only three students (eleven percent) noted that they were less than comfortable.  \n\nThere is a correlation between students’ comfortability levels and usage. For example, forty-eight percent were daily users and forty-eight percent of students were “very comfortable.” Eleven percent of students reported being less than comfortable and eleven percent of students used it once a week. \n\nFigure 4. Students’ Preferences for Methods of Instruction. \n\n \n\nFigure 4 indicates the majority of students prefered a hybrid teaching method; Fifty-nine percent of students gravitated towards a mixture of lecture and teaching themselves. \n\nFigure 5. Student Attitudes Towards Using YouTube in the Classroom.\n\nFigure 5 shows that the vast majority (eighty-five percent) of students found YouTube to be a useful tool in the classroom. \n\n** \n Post-Instruction Results**\n\nFigure 6. Percentage Increase after Instruction Intervention.\n\nFigure 6 compares the increase in scores between the pretest and the posttest with the Lecture (control) and YouTube (experimental) group for three different lessons (MLA format, comma/semicolon usage, and parallel structure). There was a +13.79% difference in the control group lecture with MLA format. However, there was a -.98% difference in identifying needs for commas or semicolons and -.48% differences in parallel structure. \n\nFigure 7. Correlation Between Average Score and Reported Comfortability Levels. \n\nFigure 7 shows the comfortability rating students indicated on a pre-study survey versus the average score they received on three tests. The average score of students who responded a comfortability level of “2” scored, on average, 70%, “3’ scored 88.3%, “4,” 71.4%, and “5,” 62%. A higher report in comfortability level did not result in a higher score. In fact, those who marked a level of “3” scored better than those, on average, who marked a “5.”\n\n**Chapter 5**\n\n Discussion, Conclusions, and Recommendations\n\n**Summary of the Study**\n\nThis study seeked to test the efficacy of autodidactism in 10th grade in English Language Arts (ELA) instruction and examine students’ attitudes towards using YouTube for learning in the classroom. Twenty-seven students in two different ELA classes participated in a four-week long study. The students took a pre-study survey for the researcher to better understand how students used YouTube in their daily lives and how they felt about using YouTube for learning. Each class took part in three sessions on different aspects of the 10th grade ELA curriculum. \n\nThe three sessions were intensive and required full attention from the students. For the most part, students took the experiment very seriously and answered questions to their best ability. In general, the sessions lasted a little over an hour and consisted of a pre-test, instruction (lecture or YouTube), and a post-test. In the lecture session, students were administered instruction by a slide show presentation and in the YouTube session, students were given a YouTube playlist curated by the researcher. After each session, students were given a worksheet to complete before the posttest. \n\n**Interpretation of Results**\n\nThe results of this study indicate that YouTube may be a viable tool in this classroom. High school students gravitate towards the resource and they use it in their daily lives. Students are comfortable with using YouTube and also feel that it is a useful tool in learning. As this study indicates, autodidacticism with YouTube produced comparable results with teacher lecture in two out of three sessions. In the MLA session, there was a stark increase of 13.79%. A possible explanation for why this occurred is because the questions were mostly qualitative. The questions were not grammatical, they rather asked specific questions about the conventions of MLA format. The researcher may have “taught to the test,” giving the control group an advantage over the experimental group, which was not the intention of the researcher. \n\n**Links to Literature Review**\n\nThomson, Bridgstock & Willems (2014) postulate that the ability to stream content allows students to circumvent the brick and mortar classroom. This reality has massive implications on the future of education and its business model; a school building is unnecessary for learning.  For this reason, McLoughlin & Lee (2010) believe that educators should focus their curriculum on teaching students media literacy: how to find credible sources online, utilize new technologies, and teach themselves using the Internet.\n\nFiglio, Rush, & Yin (2010), concluded that online instruction may prove effective for traditional students, however, students from lower socioeconomic classes may have difficulty using technology for learning. The researcher’s study would need to be compared with similar studies to test the validity of this statement, but this researcher found that their Title 1 students had little difficulty using teaching themselves using YouTube. In congruence with the conclusions of  Driscoll et. al. (2012, p. 323), this researchers also found the efficacy of self-directed learning compared to teacher lecture were similar. In regards to increases in test score, there is no advantage in teacher lecture as a means to disseminate information. \n\nIn line with Douglas (2010) and Svedberg (2010), this researcher found no correlation in students’ perceived confidence and their ability to self-educate. Their attitude towards autodidacticism was, for the most part, irrelevant. In fact, Svedberg’s (2010) study found that students that labeled themselves as “non-persisters” actually scored better on assessments than those who were “persisters”. This study echoed that notion; students who marked “3” on a confidence level measure scored scored much higher those who labeled themselves a  “5.”\n\n**Limitations** \n\nLimitations related to the findings were that the technology used in this study was temperamental. At times, computers froze or locked students out from logging in to the computer. Students may have been frustrated with the technology that was available to them for this reason, resulting in a lower test score. Another limitation related to this study were time restraints. The researcher wanted to perform more sessions with students but was unable to due to block scheduling, other classroom responsibilities, Spring Break, and school closings due to weather.  Continuous sessions may have produced different results as students would be familiar with the format of the experiment and have scored better as a result. \n\n**Conclusions**\n\nAfter analyzing quantitative data, this researcher has concluded that YouTube may be an effective tool in the classroom. In some cases, YouTube is equally, or more, effective than teacher lecture.  The researcher also found that students’ reported comfortability levels with YouTube may not indicate better scores on post-tests. \n\nWhile compiling the playlists used for this study, this researcher found that some YouTube videos explained difficult concepts excellently.  Fleck, Beckman, Sterns & Hussey (2014) discuss the advantages of using videos over teacher lecture in the classroom because videos are not bound by time, location, student or teacher mood, etc. YouTube is a massive library of videos created by experts in their field, and as new content is uploaded regularly, a place for breaking stories in every field. Overall, it is a dynamic tool that has many advantages over teacher lecture and is only getting better and more capable with time. \n\nAll teachers can find useful content on YouTube and few reasons exist to not to use it in the classroom. Educators in every field should consider uploading videos of their own to add content to the already deep breadth of knowledge. A technological future is a reality that must be embraced by educators. Teaching static information in a textbook is losing relevancy, and more dynamic means of disseminating information should be explored and utilized in the classroom to push Education into the 21st Century. \n\n**Recommendations**\n\nThe findings from this study suggest that YouTube is an asset in the classroom. Students may use this website for self-directed learning or as a supplement to classroom instruction. Teachers should teach students how to search for and locate credible sources or create playlists for their students to view. This could allow students to engage with instruction outside of the classroom.\n\n**Implications for Further Research** \n\nYouTube should be further studied in K-12 education to explore its applications in the classroom, in online environments, and in autodidactic learning. It is changing the way people consume information, but is often not recognized formally as a viable resource by academia. This researcher would like to see studies that lasted longer on the subject to further its efficacy.  Studies should be conducted with the consideration of having an online class built entirely around YouTube videos. If this is a reality, it would make the instruction aspect of education at no cost, which is a revolutionary concept. \n\nIn the future, students could theoretically “choose” their teacher. YouTube is a database of knowledge that is exponentially expanding. If a student does not understand their teacher, it could be utilized by students to get a different perspective or explanation, or it could be used in isolation for content delivery. Education should constantly strive to acknowledge tools that are free and readily available for academic and career advancement.\n\n**Action Plan**\n\nThis researcher will use YouTube more frequently in the classroom. Along with lecture, YouTube playlists will be created for students to review concepts, receive further instruction, or as a means to receive instruction in lieu of absenteeism. Videos will also be created by the researcher more frequently to use in the classroom in the place of lecture. Media literacy will be a focus; Students will be taught how to find credible videos and how to use them for academic purposes. The researcher will encourage autonomy by teaching students to use the site to further their academic, career, and personal pursuits. \n\n** \n [References](http://er.dut.ac.za/bitstream/handle/123456789/69/Siemens_2005_Connectivism_A_learning_theory_for_the_digital_age.pdf?sequence=1)**\n\nBandura, A.

That is very nice and compliments the piece. <3\n\n\n---\n\nThe \"Web 3 arbitrarily introduces scarcity to digital media\" critique seems to never go away and I think it is fundamentally flawed.\n\nDigital media has always been scarce, because there is a rights holder conferred by law unless that rights holder renounces those rights with a license.\n\nIn plain terms, this means that at least in the jurisdictions where I am able to comprehend twitter arguments, when you take a digital photograph or create a piece of digital art, the copyright of that art is automatically assigned to the creator. It is scarce. 1 of 1. In the case of infringement of your rights as copyright holder, [it can be advantageous to have formally registered the work](https://www.artbusiness.com/register_and_copyright_art_for_artists.html), however the fact remains that digital media is scarce at the point of creation.\n\nThat these critiques often come from corners who mistakenly characterize crypto as a fraudulent fiction is ironic, as the premise that the digital media we enjoy on previous internets is not scarcely owned by anyone is fictitious. No scarcity is being *imposed* on media, existing scarcity is being *surfaced* and experimented with.\n\nThis is the brilliance of the NFT experiment. NFTs represent an elegant proposal to attempt what I would describe as **feasible abundance**. I.e how can we make free media fair for the people creating it?\n\nDecades deep into the internet experiment we had not yet found a way to reconcile our desire to have as many people as possible enjoy media, while also making life financially feasible for the creators of that work. NFTs create games and value exchange around ownership and collection abstracted above access to the content itself, which ought to be available to everyone. As [Jacob.eth articulates](https://cryptomedia.wtf/), the experiment proposes that the more a work is freely available, shared and memed, the more valuable ownership of that work becomes. As such, it is almost impossible to find a piece of NFT art locked behind a token gated wall. In real terms, *meaningful scarcity* would mean withholding that access.\n\nThis premise also explains why many of the most celebrated early NFT auctions from within the Ethereum community were held to retroactively compensate popular memes, from [Nyan Cat](https://foundation.app/@NyanCat/foundation/219) to [Disaster Girl](https://foundation.app/@DisasterGirl/foundation/25046). The values put forward by many corners of the NFT community are that media ought to be freely available, and that free media ought to be valuable. Information is now free *and* expensive. To achieve both states to the satisfaction of all parties at this immature stage is a minor miracle and to be celebrated.\n\nThis accomplishment is made possible through experimentation with previously hidden dynamics, and foregrounding them can be startling to those who were not previously aware of their existence. I call this phenomenon **the shock of the nude**.\n\nMany critics of crypto and NFTs mistakenly suggest that crypto is introducing financialization, inequity or scarcity to our digital lives. This is false. Public blockchains, through making visible latent forces such as financing, unequal returns, or scarce and valuable ownership, are bringing long existing dynamics to the surface to be scrutinized. **These forces are not *new*, they are *nude*.**\n\nOur previous internet lives are financialized daily on interfaces most of us do not have access to. Web 2 has concentrated wealth and attention to a handful of players at the top (who often most dutifully serve the objectives and accept the universal terms of a handful of platforms), but few other than professional insiders *have seen* the full extent to which this is true.\n\nWhat often emerges on twitter is people with a casual, idealistic, fan-side relationship with media condescending those with a longstanding commitment and understanding of their respective industries. This gulf in knowledge becomes apparent when critics are invited to propose their own alternatives to the current state of the web for creators, with highly RTable but practically infeasible ideas ranging from [laborious illegible key exchanges on a private database](https://blog.mollywhite.net/digital-artists-post-bubble-hopes-for-nfts-dont-need-a-blockchain/) (i.e like a blockchain but way worse) to [vague allusions to revive failed state based internets from 50 years ago](https://reallifemag.com/reconnected/). These ideas sound nice to an equally inexperienced crowd, but are unserious and do not stand to help anyone but their authors. If only things were so easy!\n\nAn unsurprising byproduct of a web modeled to facilitate advertising, it is often quite difficult to discern between solid information and promotional misdirection on Web 2.  There is a significant discrepancy between the statistics the public has access to and the hard financial and industrial realities obscured by them.\n\nIn the arts, the followers and stream numbers we see are a very distorted indicator of how well the person in question is doing financially, and say little of how people actually make a living. Due to tired dynamics of self promotion and brand construction encouraged by web 2 platforms, there is little incentive for anyone to disclose that they are struggling or in a precarious position. Crypto’s public ledgers shatter illusions and hold potential of unveiling sobering truths. **Web 2 is the grift.** **Web 3 is a gift**. It is not morally sound to accept that many people are committing their 20s and 30s to participating in a fiction while silently struggling, adrift of access to good information.\n\nOnly once the warts-and-all truth is made visible do we have any hope of addressing how the world actually works. The shock of the nude may be a cold shower, but a dose of reality is far more useful to practicing artists or internet denizens than a fictitious understanding of  the web and creative industries. Access to more accurate information outside of the promotional mirage of likes and follows is an uncontroversial good for anyone aspiring to make a living.\n\nThat said, while public ledgers make it quite difficult for many to pretend that things are going better than they actually are, there is no shortage of illusion creation on public blockchains too. For a minority who have the means, it is possible to distort perceptions by illicitly pumping bags, making anonymous acquisitions and the like. **Public ledgers are no panacea**, however I find it far preferable that such coordinated distortions be legible and open to scrutiny. As discussed [in our podcast with Context.app](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/making-web3-human-legible-constructive-speculation-and-the-shock-of-the-nude-with-context), more tools are being built to make on-chain activity human legible.\n\nIt will become harder and harder over time to get away with as new forms of journalism are made possible through the ability to track foul play, even retroactively. As [Taylor Monahan recently suggested on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1532085029857284101?s=20&t=UeymocOPtyFVEUOwwmhR8A), so far often the best policing of foul play in crypto has come from within crypto itself, and that accountability will spread as more learn how to read on-chain activity.\n\nYou can follow me [@matdryhurst](http://twitter.com/matdryhurst) on twitter\n\nWe discuss matters like this with wonderful guests weekly [on the Interdependence podcast](https://interdependence.fm/)", "timestamp": 1654276758, "digest": "S-W2ZXRbrcy8bVGrKwMXSou63gWir7RJ9xs6wUn_h-0", "contributor": "0xddf29Ea907a415c9629Af3F43a9612Dec3fC481C"}

In January last year OpenAI announced [DALL·E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/), a transformer model capable of generating convincing artworks from textual descriptions. This was shortly followed by the release of [OpenAI CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) (Contrastive Language Image Pre-Training), a neural network trained on image/description pairs released for public testing.\n\nWhat followed was an explosion of experimentation beginning in Spring 2021, with artists such as (but not limited to) [Ryan Murdock](https://twitter.com/advadnoun) and [Rivers Have Wings](https://twitter.com/RiversHaveWings) releasing free and open tools for the public to play with generating artworks by connecting CLIPs capacity to discern textual prompts with open image generation techniques such as Taming Transformer’s [VQGAN](https://compvis.github.io/taming-transformers/), and OpenAI’s own novel [Guided Diffusion](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion) method.\n\nIn lay terms, to create artwork one types what one wants to see, and this combination of generator (Diffusion, VQGAN) and discriminator (CLIP) produces an image that satisfies a desired prompt. In Ryan Murdock’s Latent Visions discord group, the artist [Johannez](https://twitter.com/_johannezz) (who has been publishing artworks and tutorials around machine learning imagery and music online for years) coined the term “Promptism” for this astounding new capacity to conjure artworks from telling a neural network what one would like to see.\n\nWhile this development is but the latest advancement in a legacy of machine learning in art too long to do justice to in a blog post, this act of conjuring artworks from language *feels very very new*. Feeling is an important dimension to the act of creating an artwork, as while we have for some years had the capacity to generate art from the laborious process of training GANs, often waiting overnight for results that invite the observer to squint and imagine a future of abundant possibility, a perfect storm in the past 18 months has led to a present in which the promise of co-creation with a machine is realized. It *feels* like jamming, giving and receiving feedback while refining an idea with an inhuman collaborator, seamlessly *art-ing*. It intuitively *feels* like an art making tool.\n\nAnalogies are imperfect, but this resembles the leap from the early electronic music period of manually stitching together pieces of tape to collage together a composition to the introduction of the wired synthesizer studio, or Digital Audio Workstation. In the 20th century this progress in musical tools-at-hand took place over half a century. In contrast, this leap in machine learning generated imaging tools-at-hand has gathered steam over a 3-5 year period.\n\nThis dizzying pace of development encourages reflection!\n\n### Reflections\n\nSince Alexander Mordvintsev released the [Deep Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream) project in 2015, machine learning imagery is often associated with surrealism. It is no doubt surreal to find oneself co-creating art by probing a disembodied cognitive system trained on billions of datapoints, and the images produced can be confounding and psychedelic. However these are characteristics often ascribed to new experience. New experiences are weird, until they are no longer.\n\nAt the advent of DALL·E 2 we find it quite useful to think instead to the history of the [Pictorialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictorialism#Overview) movement.\n\n![Edward Steichen: Rodin, Le Penseur (1902)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gW2JFPpDtCNgNT6L_7tvH.jpg?height=803&width=1000&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nIn the early to mid 19th century, photography was the domain of a select group of engineers and enthusiasts, as it required a great deal of technical knowledge to realize photographs. As such, the focus of these efforts and gauge of the success of the medium was to create images that most accurately reflected the reality they intended to capture.\n\nThe Pictorialists emerged in the late 19th century as a movement intent not on using photographic techniques to most accurately depict reality, instead opting to use photography as a medium of communicating subjective beauty. This movement progressed photography from a scientific to an expressive medium in parallel with increasing access to cameras that required no technical expertise (the first amateur camera, [the Kodak, was released in 1888](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_760118)).\n\n![Léonard Misonne: By The Mill (1910s)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KWRNtSYai5BP3YC5qtNUs.jpeg?height=787&width=1070&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nDebates raged about whether or not photography could in fact be *art*, a conversation inevitably dismissed once artists were able to affordably integrate cameras into their practices. The Pictorialists extolled the artistic potential of the camera by perverting its purported function of objectively capturing the world, staging scenes and experimenting with practical effects to create subjective and expressive works. Painters soon began integrating the camera into their workflow, and now most art forms make use of sensor based imaging in one form or another.\n\nLarry Tesler’s pithy description of AI, “Artificial intelligence is whatever hasn’t been done yet.”, is equally applicable looking back to the birth of photography. Photography had also *not been done yet*, and was then (a phenomenon described as [the AI effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect)) soon integrated into most artistic and industrial practices. Sensor based imaging remains a discrete focus of research pursuing things that have not been done yet.\n\nThe parallels with this time period are clear. In machine learning imagery, the laborious task to this point has been to legitimize the medium by attempting to accurately reflect the reality of training material. Great efforts have been made to realize a convincing and novel *dog* picture from training neural networks on *dogs*. This problem has been solved, and sets the foundation upon which we can begin to be expressive.\n\nAs happened with the Pictorialists, prompt based systems like DALL·E are democratizing the means by which anyone can create AI facilitated subjective art with next to no technical expertise necessary, and we assume that in the coming decades these techniques will be integrated into artistic and industrial practices to a great degree. AI will remain a discrete field of research exploring what has not been done yet, and in 2 years we will think nothing of painters using tools like DALL·E to audition concepts, or companies using tools like DALL·E to audition furniture for their office.\n\nDALL·E represents a shift from attempts to reflect objective reality to subjective play. Language is the lens by which we reveal the objective reality known to the neural network being explored. It is a latent(hidden) camera, uncovering snapshots of a vast and complex latent space.\n\nThe same debates will rage about whether or not prompt based AI imagery can be considered *Art*, and will just as inevitably be relegated to history once everyone makes use of these tools to better share what is on their mind.\n\nThe ever evolving pursuit of art is greatly benefitted from reducing any friction in sharing what is on your mind. The observer is the ultimate discriminator, and as with any technological development that makes achieving a particular outcome more frictionless, creating great art that speaks to people in the time that it is made remains an elusive and magical odyssey.\n\nThe easier it is to generate artworks, the more challenging it will be to generate distinction and meaning, as it ever was. Great Art, like AI, is very often what hasn’t been explored yet.\n\n### DALL·E, reflections and infinite images\n\nThe first time we really got excited about DALL·E was in discovering its capacity to produce internally coherent images. Internal coherence can best be described as the ability to create convincing relationships between objects generated within an image.\n\nTo test this capacity, we began to use InPaint to extend images that we uploaded to the system without contributing a linguistic prompt. To achieve this, we would manually shift the viewfinder of InPaint in either direction to extend the scene.\n\nOne particularly successful test involved extending the scene of symbolist painter Charles Guilloux’s work - *L'allée d'eau* (1895)\n\n![Charles Guilloux - L'allée d'eau (1895)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ELIKrPrGZCDeos4Xj9qol.jpg?height=733&width=960&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n![Charles Guilloux - L'allée d'eau (Extended with DALL·E by Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uHWIrvvT-eNCNMW4f2-BS.png?height=2331&width=3569&&&&size=medium)\n\nAs you can see, DALL·E is capable of comprehending the style and subject of the scene, and extending it coherently in all directions. Perhaps most notable is its capacity to produce reflections consistent with objects present within the image. The curvature of the trees and river is successfully reflected in the new water being generated.\n\nThis capacity for internal coherence could only happen within the (then) 512x512 pixel viewfinder of InPaint, however successfully demonstrated a capacity to produce images of potentially infinite scale by producing incremental coherent *patches* of an image.\n\nWe then extended this technique to produce very large pieces under the same reflective motif. The wall sized artworks below (produced with DALL·E 1 and InPaint) are we believe the largest compositions ever produced with machine learning at their time of creation.\n\n![Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (DALL·E 1 test image)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U-bzdprWFntyErCfsO9qH.png?height=1851&width=5977&&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\n![ Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (DALL·E 1 test image)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cfbWc1wLPWZyA2eSrmCIR.png?height=2154&width=4190&&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nThis process of creating a patchwork of internally coherent images to form a larger composition was very challenging, quite like attempting to paint a wall sized work from the vantage point of a magnifying glass, and with no master guide to follow. As such, we used techniques like horizon lines to retain coherence.\n\nThere is something poetic to composing in this way. Attempting to extrapolate a bigger picture with only access to a small piece of it at a time feels appropriate in the broader context of AI.\n\nWe have not yet been able to experiment with DALL-E 2 and InPaint together in the same way, however assume that even more coherent and vivid images can be produced using a similar patchwork technique.\n\nOne can imagine efforts being made to increase the coherence of a larger composition by analyzing elements contained within an image outside of the scope of the InPaint viewfinder. With these developments in mind, we expect that these tools will soon contain all the elements necessary to produce limitless resolution compositions guided by language and stylistic prompts.\n\n### Co-authoring narrative worlds\n\nWe began to make a series of infinite images extending horizontally, which allude to the potential for these tools to tell stories in the tradition of tapestries or graphic novels. This sequence below is large enough in resolution to be printed well, and is a narrative that could be extended to infinity.\n\n![Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (DALL·E 1 test narrative)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uOF6BJERGqfUE9J81U6R-.png?height=639&width=5668&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nTo return to the original idea of extending a painting to reveal more of the scene, what might it mean to be able to produce infinite worlds from a single painting or photograph? This significantly augments the capacity of what we understand of generative art, when a coherent world, or narrative, can be spawned from a single stylistic or linguistic prompt.\n\n![Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (DALL·E 1 test narrative)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j48RjuhWHn3_biDka4-uT.png?height=4096&width=17352&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nOne can imagine narrative art forms like graphic novels or cinema being impacted from such a development. This is a particularly exciting prospect when considering the more recent development of prompt art bots being used in active Discord communities. The first of these we encountered was developed by [Wolf Bear Studio](http://wolfbearstudio.com/) for their Halloween themed art project [Ghouls ‘n GANs](https://www.ghoulsngans.io/), where discord users were invited to generate artworks via an in-thread bot, a concept more recently being experimented with by [Midjourney](https://twitter.com/midjourney) and the artist Glassface’s [iDreamer](https://idreamer.xyz/) project (also in collaboration with Wolf Bear).\n\nBots such as these, in combination with ideas such as Simon De La Rouviere’s [Untitled Frontier](https://www.untitledfrontier.studio/) experiment in narrative co-authorship, augur a future of co-creation not only with artificial intelligence systems, but also more frictionlessly with one another.\n\nThis speaks to the crux of what DALL·E *feels like*, a tool for jamming, rapid iteration and potentially co-authored social experiences. One can imagine group storytelling sessions online and IRL that produce vivid narrative art to be replayed later or viewed from afar.\n\nOnce the friction to share what is on your mind has been eliminated, the ability to co-create social narrative art experiences at the dinner table or the theatre seems conceivable and exciting!\n\n### DALL·E 2 and Spawning\n\nWe have only been working with DALL·E 2 for a short time, however what is clear is that the system has exponentially improved in terms of generated convincing and internally coherent images guided by language and image prompts.\n\nWe plan to publish more later on what we discover, however our initial experiments have involved further experimentation with the “Holly Herndon” embedding present within OpenAI CLIP. In lay terms, Holly meets the threshold of notoriety online to have characteristic elements of her image be understood by the CLIP language/image pairing network, something we explored last year with our [CLASSIFIED](https://foundation.app/collection/clsfd) series of self portraits created to reveal exactly what/who CLIP understands “Holly Herndon” to be.\n\nWe propose a term for this process, **Spawning**, a 21st century corollary to the 20th century process of sampling. If sampling afforded artists the ability to manipulate the artwork of others to collage together something new, spawning affords artists the ability to create entirely new artworks in the style of other people from AI systems trained on their work or likeness. As Holly recently communicated at the TED conference, this opens up the possibility for a new and mind-bending IP era of *Identity Play*, the ability to create works *as other people* in a responsible, fair and [permissive IP](https://www.thejaymo.net/2020/11/19/permissive-ips/) environment, something that we are exploring with the [Holly+](https://holly.mirror.xyz/54ds2IiOnvthjGFkokFCoaI4EabytH9xjAYy1irHy94) project.\n\n![Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (Holly Herndon Clones in a 3D animation style produced with DALL·E 2) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8pmVhuYofhaKRBVKzr6Gx.png?height=1360&width=2928&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nTools like DALL·E 2 and InPaint undoubtedly propel us closer to this eventuality, evidenced by these “Holly Herndon” style memes we were able to generate in early tests. \n\nMemes feel an appropriate medium for experimentation in this context, as any single meme maintains it’s vitality from its ability to be personalized and perpetually built upon. Memes are cultural embeddings, not dissimilar to the embeddings present within the latent space of a neural network. \n\nMemes are a distillation of a consensual/archetypical feeling or vibe, in much the way that the “Holly Herndon” embedding with CLIP is a distillation of her characteristic properties (ginger braid and bangs, blue eyes, often photographed with a laptop), or the “Salvador Dali” embedding is a distillation of his unique artistic style.\n\n![Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (Personalized Memes with DALL·E 2)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bt-AC_skTZP07HvRHI8h9.png?height=1024&width=3072&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nWe find personalized applications like this pretty exciting, as while DALL·E 2 (and it’s stunning variations feature we will cover at a later time) unlocks the ability to produce convincing images in art historical styles familiar to it’s training set, we feel that there could be a misconception that its utility is limited to solely recreating artistic expressions of the past.\n\nLike the introduction of the personal camera, it is easy to imagine a near future scenario in which all amateur and professional workflows across creative industries are augmented by these tools, helping people to more clearly depict what is in their mind through common language and an ever expanding training corpus.\n\nThe 21st century is going to be *wild*. We will share more as we learn more! 🦾\n\n![Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (\"A building that looks like Holly Herndon\", made with DALL·E 2)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IjS8ukonTqxpre1SehFYs.png?height=1024&width=1024&size=medium)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654277557, "digest": "efekFI71VVyGSTwDLvO3VziCMozwTXcuXGtCdB-qJ-I", "contributor": "0xB1F6C97F4D2FEBa6b128F7B6D364E1ED1dca0b99"}

Transactions on the blockchain are fully transparent, publicly accessible, and immutable.\n\nstatus quo\nThe pursuit of personal ownership and data sovereignty will also cause various security issues (because of differences in the level of individual understanding and familiarity with security knowledge), but these security issues should not become obstacles to the development of Web3.\nLet's look back in history: the similarities between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. The original version of SSL/TLS had serious vulnerabilities. Early security tools are usually rudimentary and further refined over time. From a certain perspective, Web3 security companies and projects, such as Certik, Forta, Slithe, and Securify, are the equivalent of code scanning and application security testing tools originally developed for Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 applications.\nHowever, in Web 2.0, a very important part of the security model is about the response. In Web3, a transaction cannot be changed once it is executed, so the idea of ​​security is usually that mechanisms need to be established to verify whether the transaction should have the conditions for security, and then proceed, that is, security must be better in terms of prevention.\nThe Web3 community must think about how to plan technically, address systemic weaknesses, and prevent and prevent new attack vectors that target cryptographic primitives and smart contract vulnerabilities.\n\nThere are four directions below, which can promote the prevention of Web3 security model.\nfour directions\nSource-of-truth data for vulnerabilities\nThere needs to be a source of truth for known Web3 (project) vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Today, there are already official vulnerability databases that provide core data for vulnerability management projects.\nWeb3 requires decentralized data correspondence work to eliminate information asymmetry. Currently, with incomplete (vulnerabilities, exposures, etc.) information scattered across the likes of SWC Registry, Rekt, Smart Contract Attack Vectors and DeFi Threat Matrix, Immunefi runs a bug bounty program to better find new weaknesses.\nSecurity decision-making norms\nIn Web3, key security design choices, and event decision models are still being explored. Decentralization means that no one can take full responsibility for these problems, and the impact on users can be huge. The recent Log4j vulnerability, for example, is a wake-up call to leave security concerns to the decentralized community.\nWhat is the Log4j vulnerability?\nThe Java open source tool log4j2 suddenly exposed a remote code execution vulnerability in December last year (a vulnerability that malicious actors can exploit to install malware on affected systems). Log4j2 is an open source log component tool applied to Java, which is widely used in business systems by many world-leading companies, well-known organizations and enterprises including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.\n\nLog4j2 is maintained by volunteers at the non-profit Apache Software Foundation.\nTherefore, it is necessary to further clarify how DAOs, security experts, Web3 infrastructure providers such as Alchemy and Infura, and other relevant departments cooperate to deal with emergent security issues. However, you can refer to the experience of large open source communities forming OpenSSF and CNCF advisory groups to establish processes for dealing with security issues.\nAuthentication and signing\nMost dApps on the market today, many do not have authentication or signatures for API responses. This means that when the user's wallet retrieves data from these DApps, there is a risk in verifying that such responses are from the intended (real and not fake) application and that the data has been tampered with.\nIn a world where Dapps do not have the best way to adopt basic security routines, users can only confirm their security status and credibility. This is very difficult, and there really needs to be a better way to alert users to risks .\n\nBetter key management experience (Easier, user-controlled key management)\nKey management is the basis for users to conduct transactions in the Web3 paradigm. Keys are also notoriously difficult to manage, and much of the encryption business has and will continue to revolve around key management.\nThe complexity and risk of managing private keys is also one of the main reasons why users choose custodial wallets over non-custodial wallets. However, the use of escrow wallets will lead to new phenomena: new \"intermediary products\", such as Coinbase, will be generated, which will be detrimental to the direction and ideal of Web3's complete decentralization; to a certain extent, it will also limit users' use of Web3 The ability to provide all the advantages. Ideally, further security innovations will provide users with better usability protection user experience in unmanaged scenarios.\nNotably, the first two (truth-source vulnerability data and prescriptive security decisions) initiatives revolve more around people and processes, while the third and fourth require new technological changes. Keeping new technologies, new processes, and large numbers of users in sync is one of the challenges of Web3 security.\nHowever, one thing is still very encouraging: Web3 security innovation is carried out in an open, open source environment, and creative solutions will emerge in such a scenario.\n\nTwitter：@Raca_Doge", "timestamp": 1654277713, "digest": "HfDWozHJfMHwHnaeORHY84GkXeqVB2LZ5Yaj3FmpmL4", "contributor": "0xB727932e7ae65364DA8FbC9254739268B9fE6C1A"}
{"id": "VeWRWTJqN_TLtDbPz_9c8v6fixaQLkfbv3mc6oMaEEw", "title": "Hyype X Cashie: Artist Spotlight", "body": "This interview with [@Cassieblanks](https://twitter.com/cassieblanks) (Cashie) is part of the Written Interview Series from [@HyypeHQ](https://twitter.com/hyypeHQ). \n\n**Anaroth:** Can you share a little about the transition you made as a creator from drawing to animation? I feel like that had to be such a powerful unlock.\n\n**Cashie:** I have been drawing since I was a kid, and growing up is hard, there are so many paths to choose. I made the choice to drop my drawing career and find another path because I had this feeling that I wasn’t good enough. Then this friend of mine invited me to an animation workshop, and from there I learned a lot about animation. After months of attending the workshop, finally I had a chance to have a freelance job for a 2DFX artist in the animation industry. I honed my skills there for about five years but due to the pandemic and the impacts that it had I quit that job. I decided to take a gamble on this NFT world as an animator from the start. It turned out to be a great decision, and I am happy to have the opportunities I do.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HiVjrQ2R5q-Il31OPCLI0.png?height=2941&width=4096)\n\n**Anaroth:** How did you discover NFTs? Do you find yourself still collecting today? Any grails you wish you had?\n\n**Cashie:** I had this friend of mine that introduced me to this play2earn game called Axie Infinity last July 2021. I was shocked because I had no idea that you could really earn money playing a game. From this entry point I learned about a lot of NFT games, from Cryptoblades and some other BSC Smartchain games and things that ultimately went to zero. It happens to the best of us. \n\nThat being said I learned a lot about liquidity and coin trading from my time in that space. How I was able to leverage Pancakeswap and stuff. It had been a lot of fun learning and understanding this new knowledge. However, because things didn’t pan out, yeah I became real broke after that. This is when I decided to lay low from Play2earn and start doing some of the Art contest from NFT projects. From there I found myself getting to know projects like BAYC, Doodles, Cool Cats and others. I was late! I wish instead of investing in Axie back during that time of July, I should have  minted some BAYC or some Doodles and other bluechips, but I was late. I already saw them around 1 ETH and I didn’t even have a basic grasp of what it was. That’s why I was afraid of investing that amount of money, but I wish I did! If i could just go back in time, damnit what a real life changing opportunity that would be. Haha!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d1kSvTJffnbuTA5tFIWqx.png?height=2160&width=3840)\n\n**Anaroth:** I know you get a lot of commission requests, what advice do you have for Artists that are looking to do more commission work? When and how do you allow yourself to say no?\n\n**Cashie:** Low prices can be a good weapon for being a commission related artist for startups. Just letting the world see what you can do with those prices, eventually people will start questioning you why your prices are dirt cheap. I swear, someone actually said exactly that to me. That’s when I knew my work was able to be priced higher than I had been. This also allowed me to start picking who I would want to work with. \n\nSaying No can be hard sometimes. For me, if it is hard for me to imagine what it would be and the schedule is real tight, I’ll definitely pass. I find unwanted commission work could burn out a weeks worth of energy in a single day for me. Be mindful of yourself and stay in stuff you can handle. Do not gamble with your mental health, it is too important.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P3msWYqj6oAQK5yE-T6cH.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n**Anaroth:** When you reflect back on some of your favorite pieces of artwork, is there a central theme that you feel connects them?\n\n**Cashie:** Every moving element is my other form of inspiration, just a fire in a candle can get the juices flowing in my creative brain and start seeing the beauty of it. Waves of ocean would, ripples in a glass of water, the rain, the cigarette smoke. It all mesmerizes me, and keeps me inspired.\n\nFor now I cant feel that central theme, since i worked on a lot of 2DFX and animation design on clients such as Disney, Warner Bros, Nickeldeon, MLP and others. There we are forced to alter our design to what the client wants. That’s why I have this wide range of style, but don’t necessarily feel like I have a signature design / style yet, and I do wish I did.\n\n**Anaroth:** Has your NFT commission success changed the way you think about opportunities in your future?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8X35bH00OdDlh8UCxqCKJ.png?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n**Cashie:**  One day, I will find myself as a signature artist too. It is my dream. I aspire to be my own Beeple or Gxngyxng, Deekay, Burnt Toast, or some other 1/1 Artist’s out there. It’s my goal now, and I will keep pursuing light in the dark.\n\n**Anaroth:** Who is someone you would like to collaborate with and why? Have you reached out to them to do so?\n\n**Cashie:** Gxngyxng of Ghxst and Deekay are my dudes of inspiration! i literally stare at the blank sky and think on how to be like them. Once I build my foundation of being a 1/1 Artist, maybe then I will finally have the courage to come up with plans on collaborating with them. It would be really special to have that opportunity.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kbx6C9RyNgJQOQ7KuWtIk.png?height=2000&width=2000)\n\n**Anaroth:** How do you overcome a creative block? How does a deadline impact your creativity?\n\n**Cashie:** For me I find taking a rest, or watching some awesome anime is always a good move for me to recover from a creative block I have. A deadline doesn’t impact my creativity very much, because before I start the commission, it is already finished in my head. It is kind of pre rendered in my brain. I will just need some coffee, and some good music for me to start kicking.\n\n### Don’t see your NFT community listed on Hyy.pe? 👀\n\nWe are expanding to as many collections as fast as we can.

{"id": "Mw3Op4qmOMBBFNiLvd3OxuLujXI8Du_0vfRiqfRkMlI", "title": "Hyype X Cashie: Artist Spotlight", "body": "This interview with [@Cassieblanks](https://twitter.com/cassieblanks) (Cashie) is part of the Written Interview Series from [@HyypeHQ](https://twitter.com/hyypeHQ). \n\n**Anaroth:** Can you share a little about the transition you made as a creator from drawing to animation? I feel like that had to be such a powerful unlock.\n\n**Cashie:** I have been drawing since I was a kid, and growing up is hard, there are so many paths to choose. I made the choice to drop my drawing career and find another path because I had this feeling that I wasn’t good enough. Then this friend of mine invited me to an animation workshop, and from there I learned a lot about animation. After months of attending the workshop, finally I had a chance to have a freelance job for a 2DFX artist in the animation industry. I honed my skills there for about five years but due to the pandemic and the impacts that it had I quit that job. I decided to take a gamble on this NFT world as an animator from the start. It turned out to be a great decision, and I am happy to have the opportunities I do.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HiVjrQ2R5q-Il31OPCLI0.png?height=2941&width=4096)\n\n**Anaroth:** How did you discover NFTs? Do you find yourself still collecting today? Any grails you wish you had?\n\n**Cashie:** I had this friend of mine that introduced me to this play2earn game called Axie Infinity last July 2021. I was shocked because I had no idea that you could really earn money playing a game. From this entry point I learned about a lot of NFT games, from Cryptoblades and some other BSC Smartchain games and things that ultimately went to zero. It happens to the best of us. \n\nThat being said I learned a lot about liquidity and coin trading from my time in that space. How I was able to leverage Pancakeswap and stuff. It had been a lot of fun learning and understanding this new knowledge. However, because things didn’t pan out, yeah I became real broke after that. This is when I decided to lay low from Play2earn and start doing some of the Art contest from NFT projects. From there I found myself getting to know projects like BAYC, Doodles, Cool Cats and others. I was late! I wish instead of investing in Axie back during that time of July, I should have  minted some BAYC or some Doodles and other bluechips, but I was late. I already saw them around 1 ETH and I didn’t even have a basic grasp of what it was. That’s why I was afraid of investing that amount of money, but I wish I did! If i could just go back in time, damnit what a real life changing opportunity that would be. Haha!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d1kSvTJffnbuTA5tFIWqx.png?height=2160&width=3840)\n\n**Anaroth:** I know you get a lot of commission requests, what advice do you have for Artists that are looking to do more commission work? When and how do you allow yourself to say no?\n\n**Cashie:** Low prices can be a good weapon for being a commission related artist for startups. Just letting the world see what you can do with those prices, eventually people will start questioning you why your prices are dirt cheap. I swear, someone actually said exactly that to me. That’s when I knew my work was able to be priced higher than I had been. This also allowed me to start picking who I would want to work with. \n\nSaying No can be hard sometimes. For me, if it is hard for me to imagine what it would be and the schedule is real tight, I’ll definitely pass. I find unwanted commission work could burn out a weeks worth of energy in a single day for me. Be mindful of yourself and stay in stuff you can handle. Do not gamble with your mental health, it is too important.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P3msWYqj6oAQK5yE-T6cH.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n**Anaroth:** When you reflect back on some of your favorite pieces of artwork, is there a central theme that you feel connects them?\n\n**Cashie:** Every moving element is my other form of inspiration, just a fire in a candle can get the juices flowing in my creative brain and start seeing the beauty of it. Waves of ocean would, ripples in a glass of water, the rain, the cigarette smoke. It all mesmerizes me, and keeps me inspired.\n\nFor now I cant feel that central theme, since i worked on a lot of 2DFX and animation design on clients such as Disney, Warner Bros, Nickeldeon, MLP and others. There we are forced to alter our design to what the client wants. That’s why I have this wide range of style, but don’t necessarily feel like I have a signature design / style yet, and I do wish I did.\n\n**Anaroth:** Has your NFT commission success changed the way you think about opportunities in your future?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8X35bH00OdDlh8UCxqCKJ.png?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n**Cashie:**  One day, I will find myself as a signature artist too. It is my dream. I aspire to be my own Beeple or Gxngyxng, Deekay, Burnt Toast, or some other 1/1 Artist’s out there. It’s my goal now, and I will keep pursuing light in the dark.\n\n**Anaroth:** Who is someone you would like to collaborate with and why? Have you reached out to them to do so?\n\n**Cashie:** Gxngyxng of Ghxst and Deekay are my dudes of inspiration! i literally stare at the blank sky and think on how to be like them. Once I build my foundation of being a 1/1 Artist, maybe then I will finally have the courage to come up with plans on collaborating with them. It would be really special to have that opportunity.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kbx6C9RyNgJQOQ7KuWtIk.png?height=2000&width=2000)\n\n**Anaroth:** How do you overcome a creative block? How does a deadline impact your creativity?\n\n**Cashie:** For me I find taking a rest, or watching some awesome anime is always a good move for me to recover from a creative block I have. A deadline doesn’t impact my creativity very much, because before I start the commission, it is already finished in my head. It is kind of pre rendered in my brain. I will just need some coffee, and some good music for me to start kicking.\n\n### Don’t see your NFT community listed on Hyy.pe? 👀\n\nWe are expanding to as many collections as fast as we can.

{"id": "EjtakXy1kCP-DebC8tdW63XH-t2sQR5m0CcDr6DHpZs", "title": "Arweave - The Modern Library of Alexandria", "body": "Over the past year and a half, I – like many others – have gone deep down the crypto rabbit hole. After casually trading for a number of years, I began digging a few layers deeper by reading posts and Twitter threads from [Chris Dixon](https://onezero.medium.com/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e), which led to sifting through [A16Z’s Crypto Cannon](https://a16z.com/2018/02/10/crypto-readings-resources/). Before I knew it, I was diving down the literal [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/), acquiring digital assets across far too many wallets and exchanges, feeling distracted by the constant notifications from Twitter/Telegram/Discord, and spending my weekends figuring out *how in the world* to buy promising, esoteric assets that are difficult to acquire in the US like [Arweave](https://arweave.news/how-to-buy-arweave-token/).\n\nFor folks like myself who are prone to diving headfirst into tech rabbit holes, it’s become impossible to ignore the substantive activity happening on the frontiers of crypto. Over the past year, Web3 certainly became a more frequent topic of conversation as terms like decentralization, NFT, and DeFi became part of the tech vernacular. Many people (myself included) have now gained a level of understanding to make the transition from viewing crypto as a speculative world of assets with little underlying value to the [next computing platform shift](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201621266534402). What’s most exciting to me is it feels like [the pioneers of our day](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1454466406133735432) are building on the frontier of Web3.\n\nI plan on writing about Web3 more frequently going forward. The goal of my posts is to explore the frontiers of crypto and blockchain technology through the lens of specific projects that make me excited about the future. The plan is to spend more time writing about earlier stage, low market cap crypto assets, DAOs, NFTs, and other projects on the bleeding edge of Web3 innovation. I’ll caveat that by saying I may write about some more established projects (as I do in this post) if they play into important trends shaping Web3 today.\n\nThe beauty of writing publicly is I can create personal accountability and a regular cadence around codifying my thoughts on the space, while sharing and collaborating with other folks in the crypto community. Also, the hope is I’ll be able to surface some exciting projects for those following along. Feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stevencook_) if you’re interested in connecting to trade notes and collab!\n\nTo kick things off, here is one crypto project I’m super excited about...\n\n## Arweave - The Modern Library of Alexandria\n\n![Arweave transactions chart as of Nov. 1, 2021: 79.3% Month-on-Month growth in data stored; 1,077% growth in 3 months.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cZ28nE3GXoHeTw7JSguvq.png?height=573&width=601)\n\n### What is Arweave?\n\nArweave is a new type of storage that backs data with sustainable and perpetual endowments, allowing users and developers to truly store data forever – for the very first time. Think of Arweave as a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets.\n\nThe protocol matches people who have hard drive space to spare with individuals and organizations that need to permanently store data or host content. This is similar to how Uber connects drivers with people who need transport.\n\nPermanent storage is achieved through Arweave’s decentralized data storage solution operating with blockweave technology and the native Arweave token (AR). Users of the network can pay a one-time endowment to use and provide permanent and immutable data storage. Anyone can contribute to the network and be compensated for renting out unused storage space on their computer. Arweave designed the novel Succinct Proofs of Random Access (SPoRA) consensus mechanism to maintain stability and security throughout the network. On top of the core Arweave protocol lives the permaweb: A global, permanent web of pages and applications that live forever. Once a user adds data to the permaweb, it cannot be altered or removed, even by the creator.\n\nThis description only scratches the surface of the mechanics of Arweave. For a more detailed breakdown of how Arweave works behind the scenes, check out the [Arweave Lightpaper](https://www.arweave.org/files/arweave-lightpaper.pdf).\n\n### Why am I excited about Arweave?\n\nArweave was one of the first crypto projects that had me in awe of the capabilities of blockchain technology. It’s worth pausing for a moment to marvel at the business model innovation conceived by Arweave founder [Sam Williams](https://twitter.com/samecwilliams).\n\nThe innovation lies in the fact that you can store something *permanently for a one-time fee*. When you think about storage analogs in Web2 (Box, Dropbox, AWS, etc.) or even Web3 analogs like [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/), storage always involves a recurring subscription cost. If you don’t pay that subscription, then you lose your ability to store data.\n\nCompared to these prior iterations of storage products, Arweave’s ability to offer perpetual storage for an up-front fee is completely novel. These sorts of blockchain innovations are examples of making the transition from [Web3’s skeuomorphic phase](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026963037589522), with projects that resemble products from Web2, to entirely novel projects enabled *only* by blockchain technology.\n\nArweave has been on a tear recently. To date, the protocol’s volume has been largely driven by [NFTs](https://arweave.medium.com/permanent-nft-storage-on-the-arweave-network-41f38d700a2d) and the data storage requirements of other Layer-1 blockchains like [Solana](https://solana.com/ecosystem/arweave). As illustrated in the visual below, it recently overtook the top storage protocol Filecoin as the most active storage protocol.\n\n![While Filecoin has generated more total revenue, Arweave produced more revenue than Filecoin over the past two quarters (data as of October 12th, 2021).](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rC3lhRrUZoQ003F2DpwS8.jpeg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nIn fact, [Mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/), an up-and-coming decentralized and user-owned publishing platform that hosts this post, leverages Arweave to host all user blogs to ensure that censorship is near-impossible.\n\nArweave is quickly becoming a critical piece of Web3 infrastructure. If you believe Web3 will be more prominent in 10 years than it is now, Arweave will likely be a vital player in that development.\n\nToday, most people aren’t even aware that permanent data is an option. Mass adoption will require greater awareness, public discovery, and developer education. The general public will begin to care about Arweave when they see it solving problems that can’t be solved in any other way: lawyers who need to save contracts permanently, historians who want to archive one-of-a-kind documents, artists who want to ensure their work reaches future generations.\n\nAfter much trial and error, I finally found a way to acquire Arweave in the US. Details [here](https://arweave.news/how-to-buy-arweave-token/). The difficulty lies in the fact that most centralized exchanges like FTX, Binance, and Coinbase don’t support Areave trading in the US. Decentralized exchanges like Uniswap don’t list Arweave as an available asset either. Major shout out to [everPay](https://everpay.io/), a real-time payment protocol, which uses Arweave to store all everPay transactions.

{"id": "zzuJ8aKh2QoXNie_W2rjKq8zXFf4eb8pkJyw5HCgoMU", "title": "Studying the Optimism Collective", "body": "***Disclosure: You may already be a winner of the*** ***[$OP token sweepstakes](https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/check). I am serving as a delegate for the Optimism Token House.***\n\nThis week Optimism dropped the $OP token, initiating Optimism Governance. Optimism’s governance system presents an exciting opportunity to study the latest thinking in governance design and helps us focus on shaping the next era of Web3 through its focus on public goods. With the launch of the token, Optimism created the Optimism Collective, an ecosystem that will govern the distribution of public goods funding derived from the revenue the protocol generates. The Optimism Collective is governed by three bodies: the Token House (holders of $OP), the Citizens’ House (select NFT holders), and the Foundation. Optimism’s structure is notable for its balance of power between the three governing bodies, the use of multiple voting styles (token-weighted and one-person, one-vote), and the Collective’s commitment to experimentation.\n\n*What is Optimism?*\n\nOptimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is an optimistic rollup: it is optimistic, because it assumes transactions submitted to it by users are valid; it is a rollup, because it sequences transactions off of Ethereum and periodically submits a merkle root of the transactions to Ethereum to create a resulting state change. Given that Optimism’s sequencer does not ensure the same security as Ethereum, Optimism creates a dispute period after its sequencer publishes a batch of transactions, during which a party can challenge a state change with a fault proof (for a reward) which will prevent the state change from being committed to Ethereum. Optimism is the first layer 2 to achieve EVM equivalence, meaning that there is no difference between how smart contracts are executed on L2 and L1, which makes deployment on Optimism easier.\n\n*The Optimism Collective — Mission*\n\nThe Optimism Collective is guided by a vision of “sustainably fund\\[ing\\] those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond.” In essence, Optimism is devoting protocol revenue tokenholders and trusted stewards of the community to fund public goods projects that create compounding value for Optimism and eventually Web3 and broader society. The Collective was created with a view toward making public goods creation profitable, meaning “impact=profit.” The Collective seeks to achieve its mission by funding public goods both proactively and retroactively. Proactive funding encourages innovation and risk-taking in the pursuit of public goods; retroactive funding ensures that impactful projects are rewarded.\n\n*Balance of Powers*\n\nOptimism seeks to balance the short-term and long-term views of the community by balancing power between the Token House, the Citizens’ House, and the Foundation.\n\n![Optimism Governance Overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*V9XR86iMDooYoZBg.jpeg)\n\nThe Token House is entrusted to make determinations about project incentives, protocol upgrades, and the appropriation of treasury funds to the Foundation. By leveraging the collective knowledge of the Token House, the Collective is able to improve the predictive power of its grants and adjust to the specific needs of the Optimism community. The democratic aspect of the Token House ensures that the users of the protocol have representation in determining the future of the protocol’s mission and function.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will focus on retroactive public goods funding. Citizens will be selected from the community; their citizenship is non-transferrable. By selecting individuals who have demonstrated value to the Optimism ecosystem, the Collective will increase the likelihood that retroactive funding represents true value provided to the community. Having a consistency of identity creates continuity in criteria and makes long-term decision-making possible. The method for selecting Citizens will be determined by the Foundation in consultation with the Token House.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is the steward of the Collective. It oversees the administration of governance, allocates treasury assets (including the distribution of $OP), vetoes malicious proposals, and has the power to amend the Constitution. The Foundation has many stabilizing powers for the community, yet its capabilities remain in check by the Token House. The Token House can remove directors from the Foundation and veto changes to the founding documents that would materially impair tokenholders’ rights.\n\n*Mixed Voting*\n\nThe Token House and Citizens’ House have different forms of voting to suit different functions. The Token House votes on a token-weighted basis. As in any token-weighted system, Token House voting is susceptible to plutocratic concentration of power and voter apathy. The Token House permits tokenholders to delegate their votes to stewards who have made public commitments to act as stewards for the Collective. Delegation may mitigate the power of individual holders who have high concentrations of power by enabling smaller holders to pool their votes through a delegate. Delegation also ensures that there are members of the community who are dedicated to participating in governance, mitigating the chance that small groups can collude to pass self-interested proposals with a quorum.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will operate through a one-person, one-vote system. Presuming that Citizens are chosen based on their specific insights and dedication to the ecosystem, the one-person, one-vote structure is sensible: newly minted citizens will have equal footing with incumbents for decision-making. In addition to preventing plutocratic domination, a non-transferrable one-person, one-vote system will avoid the volatility that accompanies rapid transfer of liquid governance tokens.\n\nBringing a token-weighted system together with a one-person, one-vote system creates a balance between the short-term and the long-term as well as between the prospective and retroactive. Both Houses come together to determine the Optimism network parameters, which affects the balance between transaction volume on the Optimism network and funding supply for retroactive public goods funding. This balance keeps the present and future health of the protocol fairly represented: tokenholders are not unfairly called upon to subsidize large-scale infrastructural projects, while citizens have a voice in projecting long-term funding needs to improve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n*Experimentation*\n\nOptimism’s Working Constitution is brief, but the first principle is “a commitment to experimentation.” Projects that have a need for a complex beginning also have a need for flexibility. At the point of initiation, the Optimism community can only match an understanding of their needs with governance theory and the knowledge of how other DAOs have succeeded and failed. To ensure the success of the governance process, the community needs to commit to a flexible system in order to test theory with community-specific data. By focusing on experimentation, Optimism will collect important data on what principles and rules best suit the mission of funding public goods and use that data to create a better fit between the Collective’s mission and its procedure.\n\nEarly experimentation mitigates path-dependency. By maintaining a commitment to testing theories, the community encourages honesty about the value of the governance systems it tries. A collective mindset of flexibility also encourages the community to innovate, as the cost of failure is lowered and the value of the data collected is high. If early rules are rigid, systems may proceed despite inefficiencies and flaws in the early design, and the longer the flaws linger, the more difficult it becomes to remedy them in the future.\n\nThe results of the Collective’s experiments will be public goods in themselves. Optimism will be highly visible given its critical role in scaling Ethereum, which means that its governance process will be on display for other communities that are working hard to discover the appropriate mission-governance fit. Each pitfall and success will update the Web3 community’s knowledge of how to construct a long-term sustainable system of ordering the relationships between tokenholders and their rights.\n\n*Moving Forward*\n\nFor those who are looking to design governance systems for their own projects, it is worthwhile to observe Optimism’s governance process as it proceeds. The Optimism Collective combines the learnings of the last few years of DAO design and adds new structures that may succeed or fail. As you observe Optimism’s experiment, as with your own experiments, watch for whether its structure progresses in line with its mission.

{"id": "R2K1IH1G-x_KacnZqESWU-AIxlFI838GlfhOCIyRdWE", "title": "Dtravel v2 and Beyond\n", "body": "With the launch of Dtravel v2 right around the corner, now’s the perfect opportunity to shed more light on what to expect and what the vision is beyond the v2 product.\n\nAs the second version of a long-term product, Dtravel v2 is still very early in the life of the project, but lays an important foundation for the decentralized short-term rental ecosystem that’s being built, which will continue to evolve, expand and improve with time.\n\nIn this article, we’ll discuss what differentiates Dtravel v2 from web2 platforms, why we chose a host-first approach for Dtravel v2, and how we’re building a guest experience that embodies the ethos of decentralization.\n\n## The Web3 Travel Tool\n\nDtravel is a tool rather than a platform. By combining the freedom of direct booking sites with the simplicity of online travel agencies, Dtravel v2 creates a unique web3 travel ecosystem that benefits both hosts and guests.\n\nAs a web3 ecosystem, there’s no intermediary between hosts and guests who use Dtravel. Bookings are conducted on-chain in a peer-to-peer manner, with Dtravel acting solely as the technology provider that facilitates these transactions.\n\nThis distinguishes Dtravel from existing web2 short-term rental platforms and online travel agencies, since Dtravel doesn’t exercise control over booking payments, disputes or policies. We believe that hosts deserve greater ownership of their short-term rental businesses to prevent their businesses from being at the mercy of unpredictable or inconsistent third-party policies and decisions.\n\nThe launch of Dtravel v2 aims to lower the barrier to entry for hosts and property managers while establishing a direct booking channel that offers lower fees, greater control and unrestricted guest communication.\n\nFollowing the launch of Dtravel v2 — which was designed with hosts in mind and enables travelers to book directly with hosts — the attention will turn to building a better guest experience that allows travelers to efficiently find and book Dtravel properties around the world.\n\n## Designed for Hosts\n\nDtravel v2 is a host-centric product specifically designed for hosts and property managers to easily embark on their web3 short-term rental journeys. Hosts will be able to list their properties on Dtravel via a property management system (PMS) — currently [Hostaway](https://www.hostaway.com/), with more PMS integrations on the way — in just a few clicks.\n\n​​With a PMS, hosts can manage bookings, pricing, calendars, guest information, financial reports, guest communications, cleaning duties and more across all booking platforms using one interface. This means minimal effort is spent to establish Dtravel as an additional channel, reducing the time burden of listing properties.\n\nThe host-first approach was implemented for several key reasons. First, bookings increase as the supply of available properties increases. As a global project, it’s crucial to build a product that initially prioritizes building distributed supply which can meet the demand of travelers. Without a strong foundation of properties, Dtravel cannot flourish.\n\nSecond, the problem of ownership is primarily applicable to hosts’ businesses. Most guests only book a handful of stays each year. Most hosts, however, manage their short-term rental business almost daily, which is subject to certain limitations of the platforms their properties are listed on, such as the terms, policies and page layout. Web3 is all about creating an ownership economy, starting with those who are most affected.\n\nThird, the hosting process is significantly more involved than the guest booking process. Hosts set their cancellation policy and booking rules, choose the payment methods they wish to accept from guests — including selected cryptocurrencies, fiat currency via Stripe, or both — and connect their non-custodial wallets (if accepting cryptocurrencies). Hosts who haven’t had much prior exposure to web3 applications may also require additional time to ensure their businesses are set up optimally.\n\nThe success of Dtravel depends on the success of hosts. Without hosts, there are no guests and there is no Dtravel. For this reason, we ran (and will continue to run) the Host Beta Program: to ensure we build what hosts truly want, not what we think they want.\n\nThe next critical step is to create a guest experience that allows for the efficient searchability of listings. With Dtravel listings initially only bookable directly via a unique link, we recognize the need for guests to have a simple way of viewing and comparing available listings on Dtravel.\n\n## Building the Guest Experience\n\nDtravel v2 will enable guests to book with hosts via a unique link, much like a typical direct booking website that leads straight to a host’s or hotel’s own website. However, sending potential guests to this link requires marketing power, which is one of the core obstacles of direct bookings.\n\nDesigning a way for guests to easily discover Dtravel properties is therefore the next large-scale task that will serve to connect hosts and guests, creating a more cohesive ecosystem. This is where Dtravel’s novel crossover between direct bookings and online travel agencies will happen.\n\nTo do so in a way that is consistent with the web3 ethos of decentralization, a balance needs to be struck to avoid the trap of becoming a web2 platform. Guests require the ability to find and compare listings, while hosts must continue to retain full ownership over their businesses.\n\nThere are various considerations to factor in when addressing this problem, such as whether an aggregator model should be used, how listings will be ranked, whether hosts should have the flexibility to opt-in to the proposed model, and many others.\n\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to build for the community, we’re currently exploring potential solutions with hosts in our Host Beta Program. We’re also inviting travelers to participate in our [Guest Beta Program](https://d2bpe117hv9.typeform.com/guestsurvey) and share the most important parts of the guest travel experience to help shape what a native web3 guest experience might look like.\n\nWith Dtravel v2 set to launch in the coming weeks, you’ll soon be able to take the plunge into a web3 travel ecosystem as either a host or guest (or both!).

{"id": "GO8CSigeJPxQl4BCuzrLIN24FXXzmhyL9_reL5gH6Xw", "title": "Studying the Optimism Collective", "body": "***Disclosure: You may already be a winner of the*** ***[$OP token sweepstakes](https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/check). I am serving as a delegate for the Optimism Token House.***\n\nThis week Optimism dropped the $OP token, initiating Optimism Governance. Optimism’s governance system presents an exciting opportunity to study the latest thinking in governance design and helps us focus on shaping the next era of Web3 through its focus on public goods. With the launch of the token, Optimism created the Optimism Collective, an ecosystem that will govern the distribution of public goods funding derived from the revenue the protocol generates. The Optimism Collective is governed by three bodies: the Token House (holders of $OP), the Citizens’ House (select NFT holders), and the Foundation. Optimism’s structure is notable for its balance of power between the three governing bodies, the use of multiple voting styles (token-weighted and one-person, one-vote), and the Collective’s commitment to experimentation.\n\n*What is Optimism?*\n\nOptimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is an optimistic rollup: it is optimistic, because it assumes transactions submitted to it by users are valid; it is a rollup, because it sequences transactions off of Ethereum and periodically submits a merkle root of the transactions to Ethereum to create a resulting state change. Given that Optimism’s sequencer does not ensure the same security as Ethereum, Optimism creates a dispute period after its sequencer publishes a batch of transactions, during which a party can challenge a state change with a fault proof (for a reward) which will prevent the state change from being committed to Ethereum. Optimism is the first layer 2 to achieve EVM equivalence, meaning that there is no difference between how smart contracts are executed on L2 and L1, which makes deployment on Optimism easier.\n\n*The Optimism Collective — Mission*\n\nThe Optimism Collective is guided by a vision of “sustainably fund\\[ing\\] those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond.” In essence, Optimism is devoting protocol revenue tokenholders and trusted stewards of the community to fund public goods projects that create compounding value for Optimism and eventually Web3 and broader society. The Collective was created with a view toward making public goods creation profitable, meaning “impact=profit.” The Collective seeks to achieve its mission by funding public goods both proactively and retroactively. Proactive funding encourages innovation and risk-taking in the pursuit of public goods; retroactive funding ensures that impactful projects are rewarded.\n\n*Balance of Power*\n\nOptimism seeks to balance the short-term and long-term views of the community by balancing power between the Token House, the Citizens’ House, and the Foundation.\n\n![Optimism Governance Overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*V9XR86iMDooYoZBg.jpeg)\n\nThe Token House is entrusted to make determinations about project incentives, protocol upgrades, and the appropriation of treasury funds to the Foundation. By leveraging the collective knowledge of the Token House, the Collective is able to improve the predictive power of its grants and adjust to the specific needs of the Optimism community. The democratic aspect of the Token House ensures that the users of the protocol have representation in determining the future of the protocol’s mission and function.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will focus on retroactive public goods funding. Citizens will be selected from the community; their citizenship is non-transferrable. By selecting individuals who have demonstrated value to the Optimism ecosystem, the Collective will increase the likelihood that retroactive funding represents true value provided to the community. Having a consistency of identity creates continuity in criteria and makes long-term decision-making possible. The method for selecting Citizens will be determined by the Foundation in consultation with the Token House.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is the steward of the Collective. It oversees the administration of governance, allocates treasury assets (including the distribution of $OP), vetoes malicious proposals, and has the power to amend the Constitution. The Foundation has many stabilizing powers for the community, yet its capabilities remain in check by the Token House. The Token House can remove directors from the Foundation and veto changes to the founding documents that would materially impair tokenholders’ rights.\n\n*Mixed Voting*\n\nThe Token House and Citizens’ House have different forms of voting to suit different functions. The Token House votes on a token-weighted basis. As in any token-weighted system, Token House voting is susceptible to plutocratic concentration of power and voter apathy. The Token House permits tokenholders to delegate their votes to stewards who have made public commitments to act as stewards for the Collective. Delegation may mitigate the power of individual holders who have high concentrations of power by enabling smaller holders to pool their votes through a delegate. Delegation also ensures that there are members of the community who are dedicated to participating in governance, mitigating the chance that small groups can collude to pass self-interested proposals with a quorum.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will operate through a one-person, one-vote system. Presuming that Citizens are chosen based on their specific insights and dedication to the ecosystem, the one-person, one-vote structure is sensible: newly minted citizens will have equal footing with incumbents for decision-making. In addition to preventing plutocratic domination, a non-transferrable one-person, one-vote system will avoid the volatility that accompanies rapid transfer of liquid governance tokens.\n\nBringing a token-weighted system together with a one-person, one-vote system creates a balance between the short-term and the long-term as well as between the prospective and retroactive. Both Houses come together to determine the Optimism network parameters, which affects the balance between transaction volume on the Optimism network and funding supply for retroactive public goods funding. This balance keeps the present and future health of the protocol fairly represented: tokenholders are not unfairly called upon to subsidize large-scale infrastructural projects, while citizens have a voice in projecting long-term funding needs to improve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n*Experimentation*\n\nOptimism’s Working Constitution is brief, but the first principle is “a commitment to experimentation.” Projects that have a need for a complex beginning also have a need for flexibility. At the point of initiation, the Optimism community can only match an understanding of their needs with governance theory and the knowledge of how other DAOs have succeeded and failed. To ensure the success of the governance process, the community needs to commit to a flexible system in order to test theory with community-specific data. By focusing on experimentation, Optimism will collect important data on what principles and rules best suit the mission of funding public goods and use that data to create a better fit between the Collective’s mission and its procedure.\n\nEarly experimentation mitigates path-dependency. By maintaining a commitment to testing theories, the community encourages honesty about the value of the governance systems it tries. A collective mindset of flexibility also encourages the community to innovate, as the cost of failure is lowered and the value of the data collected is high. If early rules are rigid, systems may proceed despite inefficiencies and flaws in the early design, and the longer the flaws linger, the more difficult it becomes to remedy them in the future.\n\nThe results of the Collective’s experiments will be public goods in themselves. Optimism will be highly visible given its critical role in scaling Ethereum, which means that its governance process will be on display for other communities that are working hard to discover the appropriate mission-governance fit. Each pitfall and success will update the Web3 community’s knowledge of how to construct a long-term sustainable system of ordering the relationships between tokenholders and their rights.\n\n*Moving Forward*\n\nFor those who are looking to design governance systems for their own projects, it is worthwhile to observe Optimism’s governance process as it proceeds. The Optimism Collective combines the learnings of the last few years of DAO design and adds new structures that may succeed or fail. As you observe Optimism’s experiment, as with your own experiments, watch for whether its structure progresses in line with its mission. See whether the balance of power remains stable or whether power collects too heavily in one place. Consider whether the community takes advantage of the opportunity to experiment with different structures, and whether the experiments result in tangible actions based on discrete findings.", "timestamp": 1654279931, "digest": "bjA8cQKssBxOTHYaVAbstu2xdH0FSoeUS-0qFG9rBfQ", "contributor": "0x367B4bDf414Df673Df0129838ebfB9913147427F"}

The most important thing to understand here is the path of the cyber attack – its vector. Let's take a closer look.\n\nСheck out my recent article:\n\n[https://officercia.mirror.xyz/VCUaozkvMw1CSaNm3VnafrDLX4dwEjDIQo6qSOIbO8o](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/VCUaozkvMw1CSaNm3VnafrDLX4dwEjDIQo6qSOIbO8o)\n\n\n---\n\n### Example No. 1 - RAT & Social Engineering\n\nLet’s [take an hypothetical situation](https://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap#problem-20) in which your computer gets infected with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) virus. One of two things may happen. If the attack was carried out by a rookie hacker (i.e a lamer) then he likely orchestrated a wide massive attack without a target in mind. He can steal some information on you like your browser cookies and then sell it.\n\nThe second option is that this was a direct attack. The hackers made a phishing page on your router, through which you could enter your password (poisoning of the DNS server). To prevent this type of attack, you ideally need to separate your machines and networks. You should also check certificates.\n\nHere is an example of a very dangerous cyber attack on your crypto wallet:\n\n![Source: researchgate.net/publication/339224082_A_Taxonomy_of_Social_Engineering_Defense_Mechanisms](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ETiPKc18AhScO65MJBgxQ.png?height=380&width=663)\n\n1. Your computer gets infected by malware with a [crypto clipper](https://twitter.com/officer_cia/status/1491920415387574275).\n2. Let us say you want to send money from your crypto account to your friend.\n3. When you attempt to copy and paste your friend’s crypto, ETH or BTC address, the clipper will substitute your friend’s address with a generated one that looks a lot like your friend’s (starts and ends with the same characters).\n4. Thus, instead of sending crypto to your friend’s account you actually direct the money directly into the hacker’s account.\n\nConsider checking the entire address of your addressee’s wallet before you click Send.\n\nSophisticated crypto criminals will throw at you a mix of attack vectors. It could be ​​a Social Engineering vector, plus phishing and a classic malware. They might even attempt a[ physical attack](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks/blob/master/README.md)!\n\n\n---\n\n### Example No. 2 - The Troll and the Knight\n\nLet us take Jane who is a diligent employee at her company. Information about Jane is publicly available on her social networks. Some sensitive information about her might have even been revealed in some leak, such as the 2014 Yahoo Mail user account information breach. Generally, she is no different from you or us. So far, so good.\n\nBut then, a troll shows up and starts stalking her around the social networks, writing hurtful comments, for example. He expands his cyberbullying to others in Jane’s company, bringing distress to his victims.\n\nEven at this stage, the attack has done enough damage to [cripple the culture of openness](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339224082_A_Taxonomy_of_Social_Engineering_Defense_Mechanisms) inside the company.  Employees may stop sharing personal information or speaking candidly about problems for fear of ridicule or retaliation.\n\nJane continues to suffer the troll's attacks in silence. If Jane blocks the troll’s account, he will make another. If he knows her address, multiple pizza deliveries may suddenly arrive at her door. It is no life.\n\nAt this point in our story, in comes John. He is a stranger but, he too, has a public account and has suffered from the actions of this same troll as evident from attacks on his page. He makes Jane a proposition for cooperation on how to stop the attacks. He says he knows a way to silence the troll.\n\nSure he knows the way. The Knight to the Rescue and the Evil Troll are one and the same person. The troll’s trick was to establish an emotionally supportive bond with someone who was experiencing pain. John created a condition where Jane is now more likely to follow John’s seemingly innocent suggestion. She may click on a URL link or open a file sent to her. She might even come out and meet John.\n\nThis story may end badly for Jane. A potential scam by John should have been stopped at the beginning – at the stage when the [target got recruited](https://telegra.ph/How-crypto-gets-stolen-06-21).\n\n![Source: arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00132.pdf ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l9XR9d-MtVAOOoxo3BJbI.png?height=507&width=1600)\n\nAre there any good guidelines to follow so that we do not end up in Jane’ position?\n\n1. The piece of advice “don't let strong emotions influence your actions” applies well for investing into stocks or when choosing a life partner. It can be your first rule in the digital world playground.\n2. If you get scammed, do not lose heart. One thing victims often tell us after being defrauded is “I can’t believe I was so stupid.” Scams happen to the best among us. Evolutionary psychology tells us that we have been wired by evolution to trust other humans for the purpose of our survival. This is why any exploitation of this strong evolutionary adaptation is particularly painful to us.\n3. If you are in a managerial role, make sure your employees aren't sick, tired or go hungry at work. When employees are physically or emotionally weakened, they become vulnerable to psychological influence.\n4. If you work a lot with files, particularly PDFs, you can use these protective [measures](https://twitter.com/officer_cia/status/1516440538999922694).\n5. While you may be wary of third parties trying to steal your information, you should also[ watch out for insider threats](https://cryptosec.info/checklist/), such as negligent employees and disgruntled workers.\n6. We recommend that you follow these [25 rules](https://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap) to safeguard yourself from nefarious Internet scammers. The first [10 rules](https://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap) on the list relate to personal security, and the rest to corporate security.\n\nExploitation of love or anger happens less often because the scammer would need to maintain a psychological connection with the victim, requiring skill, time and familiarity with the target. In our situation the scammer exploited the victims' fear. What is more, in order for this attack to succeed the victim had to be rushed.\n\n![Source: www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404816300268](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Bxeg3Is6OjmYgm3IfYp0q.png?height=356&width=659)\n\nA skillful social engineer will not give the victim much time to think, and will always press for urgency. This is the first thing to pay attention to – If you are rushed to give out sensitive information (or any information at all, for that matter), it is a good time to pause.\n\nThe second point to note is that when you find yourself in a similar situation, do not try to solve the problem by yourself. Ask a friend, a frequent contributor to your favorite Discord server or a moderator of any well-known DAO. Good people want to help. Get a second opinion.\n\nSometimes scammers just want to get dirt on the victim or de-anonymize the target.   Often, however, sophisticated cyber exploits can come coupled with either a malware injection or a phishing attack, or some other surprise.\n\nYes, it seems like it is a veritable minefield over there.

Let us say you want to send money from your crypto account to your friend.\n3. When you attempt to copy and paste your friend’s crypto, ETH or BTC address, the clipper will substitute your friend’s address with a generated one that looks a lot like your friend’s (starts and ends with the same characters).\n4. Thus, instead of sending crypto to your friend’s account you actually direct the money directly into the hacker’s account.\n\nConsider checking the entire address of your addressee’s wallet before you click Send.\n\nSophisticated crypto criminals will throw at you a mix of attack vectors.

Information about Jane is publicly available on her social networks. Some sensitive information about her might have even been revealed in some leak, such as the 2014 Yahoo Mail user account information breach. Generally, she is no different from you or us. So far, so good.\n\nBut then, a troll shows up and starts stalking her around the social networks, writing hurtful comments, for example. He expands his cyberbullying to others in Jane’s company, bringing distress to his victims.\n\nEven at this stage, the attack has done enough damage to [cripple the culture of openness](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339224082_A_Taxonomy_of_Social_Engineering_Defense_Mechanisms) inside the company.  Employees may stop sharing personal information or speaking candidly about problems for fear of ridicule or retaliation.\n\nJane continues to suffer the troll's attacks in silence. If Jane blocks the troll’s account, he will make another. If he knows her address, multiple pizza deliveries may suddenly arrive at her door. It is no life.\n\nAt this point in our story, in comes John. He is a stranger but, he too, has a public account and has suffered from the actions of this same troll as evident from attacks on his page. He makes Jane a proposition for cooperation on how to stop the attacks. He says he knows a way to silence the troll.\n\nSure he knows the way. The Knight to the Rescue and the Evil Troll are one and the same person. The troll’s trick was to establish an emotionally supportive bond with someone who was experiencing pain. John created a condition where Jane is now more likely to follow John’s seemingly innocent suggestion. She may click on a URL link or open a file sent to her.

{"id": "M1Fc8rSEh7pPvBZwKKZGFDsuORDYjtHoGWOIOA-wNws", "title": "Ursula 3: An Interview with Hannah Whitaker", "body": "By **[Kristyna Archer](https://twitter.com/KristynaArcher)**\n\nHannah Whitaker’s body of work, *Ursula 3* examines our relationship with technology and digital servantry in contemporary life. Working meticulously in the studio between both analog and digital tools, Whitaker engages in a process of world-building around the development of a character named Ursula. As a continuation of an existing body of work, in this new series Whitaker incorporates special effects lighting, silhouettes, rear projection and fabricated sets to evoke a more established language of the Ursula lineage. She continues to push the exploration of gender stereotypes, AI, digital consent, and dehumanization. Whitaker is challenging the ubiquitous public domain of female bots and servants and highlights their consequences, damage, and complexities as we usher Ursula into a synthetic universe.\n\n![Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/72oxJvdzDLQ-xbp5ZwCen.png?height=444&width=1280&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: This series, *Ursula 3*, is an extension of your previous bodies of work featuring the same character. She is a female form, obscured in silhouette, against celestial, sci-fi inspired luminous backdrops, exploring the ever-present gender bias found in an increasing era of digital servants, AI, and sex-bots. In your new Obscura commissioned series, you overtly cover her form with futuristic, iridescent gloves, a hood, and a turtleneck, almost as if you were trying to unsex her image. Was this an attempt to see if you could in fact make her less objectified and perhaps more human?** \n\n**WHITAKER:** With their hard lines and geometric clarity, I think of the works as alluding to a graphic perfection that is ultimately undermined by all the dust and hairs of actual life. I think of Ursula similarly. She has a lovely profile and a sympathetic face and a long, skinny physique. In many ways, she adheres to conventional beauty standards and invokes an ideal form. But there is also something very strange and alien about her. (I’m referring now to Ursula, not Karen, who does an amazing job of embodying the character.) \n\nWhile Ursula clearly points to a physical ideal, to me, she has also always been and continues to be completely devoid of sex. Her expressions are calm and composed and her movements mechanical. I think of her as bloodless. So the reflective garments are in keeping with this. It’s not really about covering her form as her form is never really visible to begin with. But the garments, in accentuating her gestures, can create the sense of seeing her even if you still never really are able to.\n\n**ARCHER: I'm fascinated by the processes you have used to create Ursula’s universe. Rather than sketching out your compositions in the physical world, I read you design the rough final image in photoshop and then bring it to life with analogue processes, hand-cut masks, and layered exposures on 4x5 film. It feels purposefully disruptive, and in a way that is bold and irreverent. I’d love to hear more about the ‘why’ behind your process.** \n\n**WHITAKER:** The process that you’re referring to applies to older work of mine. Those works were multiple exposures shot on 4x5 film through hand-cut masks that I inserted into the camera. This allowed me to only expose parts of the film at a time. I could create images that looked constructed in a way that conventional photographs cannot. At the same time, it was still a completely optical process, so in spite of the planning and control, unforeseen details were always recorded. I liked the way that process allowed me to have an idea for an image and to then make it exactly. The process made me feel like a machine–I had to follow my own instruction sets for how to make the work. It was with those works that I initially developed the Ursula character. Her face and various body parts appeared silhouetted and often repeated in a mechanical and detached manner. \n\n**ARCHER: ​​As an artist that works in a very controlled manner, how do you allow for any happy accidents to occur during the process?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** I started shooting conventional photographs again a few years ago and doing so allows for many more opportunities for chance. I still do sketches and plan things out but the planning takes a different form than when I was making the film works. Now I procure props, set materials, and garments. I research source imagery and lighting techniques. I buy or rent photographic equipment I need. Karen Meléndez, the model I like to work with, doesn’t live in NYC so when she is in town I shoot tons of work at once. Even with all the planning, it’s really hard to predict what will work when I’m actually shooting. Sometimes the photographs are essentially exactly how I planned and sometimes what I planned doesn’t work at all and the photograph will hinge on some unexpected gesture or lighting accident. \n\n![Ursula 3 #15 (left) and #6 (right) by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kf-r-IsXPNSJuiRISTEbu.jpg?height=1024&width=1516&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: In the large scope of the project, AI and female voice assistants risk dulling our capability of intimacy. To me, these technologies become transactional and devoid of meaningful connection. Is this numbness of the digital era present in your work? Do we ever develop an empathy towards Ursula, or is the truth that one can not?  Are we in fact dehumanizing her, or is she actually a fully dimensional being, as you stated?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Certainly Hollywood thinks so! The notion of a fabricated woman who is created to serve her maker has been in the public domain for a very long time. The story of the female form untethered from the complexities of an actual human being has been told many times. In Ovid’s Metamorphoses, written 8 AD, Pygmalian hates women so he carves one out of ivory and falls in love with her. I’m not sure how it relates to intimacy but ubiquity of passive and servile female digital assistants certainly reinforces damaging stereotypes. It seems clear from the innumerous similar stories of fabricated women combined with the impulse to gender digital servants as female, that women, in general, are dehumanized in the popular imagination as a matter of course. I’m not sure why Ursula would be any different. One reason I want those tangles of hairs and glints of light on her eyes in the photographs is to insist on her humanity. \n\n**ARCHER: In respect to the NFT avatar-driven PFP way of life where anonymity is the superpower, it creates this contrast of alluring mystery and inherent disconnection. Is this something you are exploring with the silhouettes?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Yes but only in the broadest possible sense. The work responds to a generalized sense of alienation and misrepresentation relating to technology and contemporary life. Online there’s difficulty in knowing people and being known in meaningful ways, particularly for women. Conversely there’s also a fear of being known, and there is a constant battle to protect oneself from unspecified threats. The work points to the complex relationship that human beings have with technology, which is constantly changing, and which no one could possibly fully understand in the moment.\n\n**ARCHER: There are elements of Trompe-l’oeil and illusion in your analogue-native work that manipulate the viewers’ perceptions and are intrinsic to your process. Do you feel this highlights the opportunities for disruption of non-digital-native art, like the impact of photography in the NFT space, as we continue to become more immersed in these digitally native worlds?** \n\n**WHITAKER:** I don’t tend to think of photography as not native to the digital space, though I get what you mean. I suppose NFTs started out with digitally-created images and photo NFTs came later. But photography has always been a huge part of the images trafficked online and a major driver of technology in hardware, software, and social media. Are the digitally native worlds interested in the veracity of an image? I don’t know! \n\nI personally like to make my work in-camera, not out of a sense of superiority to digitally native imagery, but because I think my work is more complex when the real world inserts itself into it. Karen is always trying to smooth out her hair when we’re shooting but I love seeing a tangle of hairs recorded in high photographic resolution. That way the photographs contain more than just my own ideas. \n\n![Ursula 3 #26 (left) and #14 (right) by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hPmwS2HeVrAtVvMxLLT4u.jpg?height=1024&width=1516&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: Is there any deeper meta interconnection between the idea of “right-click & save” of images profierating the internet, on top of being a series of images of a digital servant? The use and abuse of power runs deep. Abuse meaning, the stealing of image use without proper credit exists in web2. Now *Ursula 3* will be on-chain and can not be modified or detached from her owner.**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Right-clicking and saving images doesn’t bother me actually. I would be happy to have someone like my image enough to save it so they can look at it regularly. I mean, obviously I don’t want them to pass it off as their own or make money off it, but just saving it I’m okay with. To me, right clicking and saving isn’t an inherently abusive act and doesn’t undermine the commodity value of an NFT. But the connection that you’re drawing is interesting. I do think that the notion of a digital servant is related to wanting to have power over someone. Being able to abuse someone without any consequences comes with it. Maybe it relates to wanting to be able to do what you want all the time without constraint. \n\n![Ursula 3 #8 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LNjyacFH_R2nmMcbrDtcg.jpg?height=1024&width=758&size=medium)\n\n**ARCHER: Do you see a conversation occurring between the Ursula character and these new contexts of blockchain, NFTs, and the metaverse that she now occupies?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** While I wasn’t thinking at all about NFTs when I developed the character, she certainly makes a lot of sense on a conceptual level in the NFT space. I mean, the project does touch directly on the question of how to represent people in the digital sphere.  \n \n\n**ARCHER: In your artist’s statement, you mention you “usher her \\[Ursula\\] into a synthetic universe,” as if releasing her into the wild of the metaverse. Her release or escape into web3 is quite ironic in its evolution. If web3 is supposed to decentralize and flatten previous hierarchical societal constructs, can this new synthetic universe of the blockchain actually free her because inherently web3 hopes to disrupt and remove bureaucracy? Perhaps in effect she will be more free here than the gender bias that has been instilled previously?** \n\n**WHITAKER:** I would be shocked if Web3 will ultimately be spared the structural biases of the real world but I love your optimism! There’s a lot I don’t understand about Web3 but I don’t think anything made by people who developed consciousness in a flawed world (ie everyone) can really escape it. \n\n**ARCHER: With NFT culture highlighting digital, generative AI-driven art like nothing ever before in history, have these new technological paradigms inspired any thoughts on how you might introduce this into your own work? Have you ever considered implementing an actual AI process or forms of automation into your work processes that removes some of your control as an artist?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** The 4x5 film process started out as a way to remove some of my control as an artist. At the time I was thinking a lot about John Cage’s chance operations. But now that I’m working with a digital camera making conventional photographs, I don’t see myself relinquishing control any time soon. I’m really interested in photography as a medium–it’s history, its influence on culture, its power to seduce. In that sense, I’m still very interested in making my own specific kind of photographs. I want the images I make to comment on contemporary life but also relate to some of the images that I drew from– like album art from the 70s, or fashion photography from the 60s, or posters from the 80s.  \n \n\n**ARCHER: Apparently, Siri got her name after the Norwegian name that means \"beautiful woman who leads you to victory,\" can I ask why “Ursula?” \n WHITAKER:** I have also heard that Siri was named for a specific woman – a Norwegian meteorologist named Siri Kalvig. I chose the name Ursula for a few reasons. I liked that it's a name that feels both old fashioned and futuristic at the same time. It’s also frightened by a lot of associations– the witch from the Little Mermaid, Ursula le Guin the feminisit sci-fi writer, and Ursula Andress a Swiss actress/bond girl/sex symbol. The triangulation of the villain, sci-fi, and iconic beauty seemed about right.\n\n![Ursula 3 #11 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ccTQu0yBF57_7XnR0gVSk.jpg?height=1024&width=758&size=medium)\n\n**ARCHER: What are you most excited about with what the blockchain offers for artists and what Obscura is doing in partnership with your future path?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Obscura basically funded the making of a ton of new work with no strings attached. I had total creative freedom. That’s never happened to me before in my entire career and it felt amazing. In general what I’m most excited about is the availability of new models of living and working for artists. I still operate in and appreciate the legacy art world but few would argue that it serves all artists well. I’m all for the creation of new income streams for artists, new opportunities for discourse about art, and new forms of community-building.\n\n![Ursula 3 #22 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dgllesZkOdyFkx1KNY4D6.jpg?height=1024&width=758&size=medium)\n\n**To view the full collection** of Hannah Whitaker’s Obscura Commissioned drop:\n\n[https://obscura.io/collections/hannah-whitaker](https://obscura.io/collections/hannah-whitaker)\n\n**To view other NFT works** of the artist: \n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/hannahwhitaker-ursula](https://opensea.io/collection/hannahwhitaker-ursula)\n\n \n **Follow Hannah Whitaker** on Twitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/_hannahwhitaker](https://twitter.com/_hannahwhitaker)\n\n \n **Follow Obscura DAO** on Twitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/obscuradao](https://twitter.com/obscuradao)\n\n \n \n\nJoin the **Obscura Discord:**\n\n[https://discord.com/invite/obscura](https://discord.com/invite/obscura)\n\n \n Want to **Contribute to the Obscura DAO?**\n\n[https://airtable.com/shrgZ0BhGA0stsqik](https://airtable.com/shrgZ0BhGA0stsqik)\n\n \n Want to **Partner with Obscura?**\n\n[https://airtable.com/shr0qRDmFLro3V7i9](https://airtable.com/shr0qRDmFLro3V7i9)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654280192, "digest": "4hdx1pzHlhOTzQ5aAGCi0e7eQQtXu9r1hU1NpLD2K9I", "contributor": "0xFda746F4C3f9F5A02b3E63ed6d0eBBc002d1f788"}

One of two things may happen. If the attack was carried out by a rookie hacker (i.e a lamer) then he likely orchestrated a wide massive attack without a target in mind. He can steal some information on you like your browser cookies and then sell it.\n\nThe second option is that this was a direct attack. The hackers made a phishing page on your router, through which you could enter your password (poisoning of the DNS server). To prevent this type of attack, you ideally need to separate your machines and networks. You should also check certificates.\n\nHere is an example of a very dangerous cyber attack on your crypto wallet:\n\n![Source: researchgate.net/publication/339224082_A_Taxonomy_of_Social_Engineering_Defense_Mechanisms](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ETiPKc18AhScO65MJBgxQ.png?height=380&width=663)\n\n1.

Let us say you want to send money from your crypto account to your friend.\n3. When you attempt to copy and paste your friend’s crypto, ETH or BTC address, the clipper will substitute your friend’s address with a generated one that looks a lot like your friend’s (starts and ends with the same characters).\n4. Thus, instead of sending crypto to your friend’s account you actually direct the money directly into the hacker’s account.\n\nConsider checking the entire address of your addressee’s wallet before you click Send.\n\nSophisticated crypto criminals will throw at you a mix of attack vectors.

Information about Jane is publicly available on her social networks. Some sensitive information about her might have even been revealed in some leak, such as the 2014 Yahoo Mail user account information breach. Generally, she is no different from you or us. So far, so good.\n\nBut then, a troll shows up and starts stalking her around the social networks, writing hurtful comments, for example. He expands his cyberbullying to others in Jane’s company, bringing distress to his victims.\n\nEven at this stage, the attack has done enough damage to [cripple the culture of openness](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339224082_A_Taxonomy_of_Social_Engineering_Defense_Mechanisms) inside the company.  Employees may stop sharing personal information or speaking candidly about problems for fear of ridicule or retaliation.\n\nJane continues to suffer the troll's attacks in silence. If Jane blocks the troll’s account, he will make another. If he knows her address, multiple pizza deliveries may suddenly arrive at her door. It is no life.\n\nAt this point in our story, in comes John. He is a stranger but, he too, has a public account and has suffered from the actions of this same troll as evident from attacks on his page. He makes Jane a proposition for cooperation on how to stop the attacks. He says he knows a way to silence the troll.\n\nSure he knows the way. The Knight to the Rescue and the Evil Troll are one and the same person. The troll’s trick was to establish an emotionally supportive bond with someone who was experiencing pain. John created a condition where Jane is now more likely to follow John’s seemingly innocent suggestion. She may click on a URL link or open a file sent to her. She might even come out and meet John.\n\nThis story may end badly for Jane. A potential scam by John should have been stopped at the beginning – at the stage when the [target got recruited](https://telegra.ph/How-crypto-gets-stolen-06-21).\n\n![Source: arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00132.pdf ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l9XR9d-MtVAOOoxo3BJbI.png?height=507&width=1600)\n\nAre there any good guidelines to follow so that we do not end up in Jane’ position?\n\n1.

Much more reliable (and fun) when compared to shilling in DMs.\n\n### Scream:\n\nNot literally, but through your art.\n\nSales still happen in bear markets, but not as frequently. So you need to ensure you’re standing out as much as you can while staying authentic to you and your art.\n\nHow do you do that?\n\n* Create something so mind-blowing that people feel like they HAVE to own it,\n* Continue to connect with artists & collectors alike,\n* market the piece in a unique way - Example: Turn your drop into a multi-part story, with each piece sharing more and more detail.\n\n### Parting Thoughts:\n\nSo how can a bear market change your life?\n\nTo put things simply, if you spend the next 3 months networking with as many artists and collectors as possible on Twitter, creating incredible art and making noise about the work you produce, there’s no doubt you can change the quality of your relationships, art and community.", "timestamp": 1654281592, "digest": "dcBnr1DHOlEb4YBuRZmK8RSoa_chLgCA8p6fYhed_tw", "contributor": "0x17998ba12753252df498cc7840512B5a4CAE6476"}

{"id": "dLpQdwKhzgn-UOqWMyjr4roua1XXJl2TT3RO8tPvMFc", "title": "Ursula 3: An Interview with Hannah Whitaker", "body": "By **[Kristyna Archer](https://twitter.com/KristynaArcher)**\n\nHannah Whitaker’s body of work, *Ursula 3* examines our relationship with technology and digital servantry in contemporary life. Working meticulously in the studio between both analog and digital tools, Whitaker engages in a process of world-building around the development of a character named Ursula. As a continuation of an existing body of work, in this new series Whitaker incorporates special effects lighting, silhouettes, rear projection and fabricated sets to evoke a more established language of the Ursula lineage. She continues to push the exploration of gender stereotypes, AI, digital consent, and dehumanization. Whitaker is challenging the ubiquitous public domain of female bots and servants and highlights their consequences, damage, and complexities as we usher Ursula into a synthetic universe.\n\n![Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/72oxJvdzDLQ-xbp5ZwCen.png?height=444&width=1280&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: This series, *Ursula 3*, is an extension of your previous bodies of work featuring the same character. She is a female form, obscured in silhouette, against celestial, sci-fi inspired luminous backdrops, exploring the ever-present gender bias found in an increasing era of digital servants, AI, and sex-bots. In your new Obscura commissioned series, you overtly cover her form with futuristic, iridescent gloves, a hood, and a turtleneck, almost as if you were trying to unsex her image. Was this an attempt to see if you could in fact make her less objectified and perhaps more human?** \n\n**WHITAKER:** With their hard lines and geometric clarity, I think of the works as alluding to a graphic perfection that is ultimately undermined by all the dust and hairs of actual life. I think of Ursula similarly. She has a lovely profile and a sympathetic face and a long, skinny physique. In many ways, she adheres to conventional beauty standards and invokes an ideal form. But there is also something very strange and alien about her. (I’m referring now to Ursula, not Karen, who does an amazing job of embodying the character.) \n\nWhile Ursula clearly points to a physical ideal, to me, she has also always been and continues to be completely devoid of sex. Her expressions are calm and composed and her movements mechanical. I think of her as bloodless. So the reflective garments are in keeping with this. It’s not really about covering her form as her form is never really visible to begin with. But the garments, in accentuating her gestures, can create the sense of seeing her even if you still never really are able to.\n\n**ARCHER: I'm fascinated by the processes you have used to create Ursula’s universe. Rather than sketching out your compositions in the physical world, I read you design the rough final image in photoshop and then bring it to life with analogue processes, hand-cut masks, and layered exposures on 4x5 film. It feels purposefully disruptive, and in a way that is bold and irreverent. I’d love to hear more about the ‘why’ behind your process.** \n\n**WHITAKER:** The process that you’re referring to applies to older work of mine. Those works were multiple exposures shot on 4x5 film through hand-cut masks that I inserted into the camera. This allowed me to only expose parts of the film at a time. I could create images that looked constructed in a way that conventional photographs cannot. At the same time, it was still a completely optical process, so in spite of the planning and control, unforeseen details were always recorded. I liked the way that process allowed me to have an idea for an image and to then make it exactly. The process made me feel like a machine–I had to follow my own instruction sets for how to make the work. It was with those works that I initially developed the Ursula character. Her face and various body parts appeared silhouetted and often repeated in a mechanical and detached manner. \n\n**ARCHER: ​​As an artist that works in a very controlled manner, how do you allow for any happy accidents to occur during the process?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** I started shooting conventional photographs again a few years ago and doing so allows for many more opportunities for chance. I still do sketches and plan things out but the planning takes a different form than when I was making the film works. Now I procure props, set materials, and garments. I research source imagery and lighting techniques. I buy or rent photographic equipment I need. Karen Meléndez, the model I like to work with, doesn’t live in NYC so when she is in town I shoot tons of work at once. Even with all the planning, it’s really hard to predict what will work when I’m actually shooting. Sometimes the photographs are essentially exactly how I planned and sometimes what I planned doesn’t work at all and the photograph will hinge on some unexpected gesture or lighting accident. \n\n![Ursula 3 #15 (left) and #6 (right) by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kf-r-IsXPNSJuiRISTEbu.jpg?height=1024&width=1516&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: In the large scope of the project, AI and female voice assistants risk dulling our capability of intimacy. To me, these technologies become transactional and devoid of meaningful connection. Is this numbness of the digital era present in your work? Do we ever develop an empathy towards Ursula, or is the truth that one can not?  Are we in fact dehumanizing her, or is she actually a fully dimensional being, as you stated?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Certainly Hollywood thinks so! The notion of a fabricated woman who is created to serve her maker has been in the public domain for a very long time. The story of the female form untethered from the complexities of an actual human being has been told many times. In Ovid’s Metamorphoses, written 8 AD, Pygmalian hates women so he carves one out of ivory and falls in love with her. I’m not sure how it relates to intimacy but ubiquity of passive and servile female digital assistants certainly reinforces damaging stereotypes. It seems clear from the innumerous similar stories of fabricated women combined with the impulse to gender digital servants as female, that women, in general, are dehumanized in the popular imagination as a matter of course. I’m not sure why Ursula would be any different. One reason I want those tangles of hairs and glints of light on her eyes in the photographs is to insist on her humanity. \n\n**ARCHER: In respect to the NFT avatar-driven PFP way of life where anonymity is the superpower, it creates this contrast of alluring mystery and inherent disconnection. Is this something you are exploring with the silhouettes?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Yes but only in the broadest possible sense. The work responds to a generalized sense of alienation and misrepresentation relating to technology and contemporary life. Online there’s difficulty in knowing people and being known in meaningful ways, particularly for women. Conversely there’s also a fear of being known, and there is a constant battle to protect oneself from unspecified threats. The work points to the complex relationship that human beings have with technology, which is constantly changing, and which no one could possibly fully understand in the moment.\n\n**ARCHER: There are elements of Trompe-l’oeil and illusion in your analogue-native work that manipulate the viewers’ perceptions and are intrinsic to your process. Do you feel this highlights the opportunities for disruption of non-digital-native art, like the impact of photography in the NFT space, as we continue to become more immersed in these digitally native worlds?** \n\n**WHITAKER:** I don’t tend to think of photography as not native to the digital space, though I get what you mean. I suppose NFTs started out with digitally-created images and photo NFTs came later. But photography has always been a huge part of the images trafficked online and a major driver of technology in hardware, software, and social media. Are the digitally native worlds interested in the veracity of an image? I don’t know! \n\nI personally like to make my work in-camera, not out of a sense of superiority to digitally native imagery, but because I think my work is more complex when the real world inserts itself into it. Karen is always trying to smooth out her hair when we’re shooting but I love seeing a tangle of hairs recorded in high photographic resolution. That way the photographs contain more than just my own ideas. \n\n![Ursula 3 #26 (left) and #14 (right) by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hPmwS2HeVrAtVvMxLLT4u.jpg?height=1024&width=1516&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: Is there any deeper meta interconnection between the idea of “right-click & save” of images profierating the internet, on top of being a series of images of a digital servant? The use and abuse of power runs deep. Abuse meaning, the stealing of image use without proper credit exists in web2. Now *Ursula 3* will be on-chain and can not be modified or detached from her owner.**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Right-clicking and saving images doesn’t bother me actually. I would be happy to have someone like my image enough to save it so they can look at it regularly. I mean, obviously I don’t want them to pass it off as their own or make money off it, but just saving it I’m okay with. To me, right clicking and saving isn’t an inherently abusive act and doesn’t undermine the commodity value of an NFT. But the connection that you’re drawing is interesting. I do think that the notion of a digital servant is related to wanting to have power over someone. Being able to abuse someone without any consequences comes with it. Maybe it relates to wanting to be able to do what you want all the time without constraint. \n\n![Ursula 3 #8 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LNjyacFH_R2nmMcbrDtcg.jpg?height=1024&width=758&size=medium)\n\n**ARCHER: Do you see a conversation occurring between the Ursula character and these new contexts of blockchain, NFTs, and the metaverse that she now occupies?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** While I wasn’t thinking at all about NFTs when I developed the character, she certainly makes a lot of sense on a conceptual level in the NFT space. I mean, the project does touch directly on the question of how to represent people in the digital sphere.  \n \n\n**ARCHER: In your artist’s statement, you mention you “usher her \\[Ursula\\] into a synthetic universe,” as if releasing her into the wild of the metaverse. Her release or escape into web3 is quite ironic in its evolution. If web3 is supposed to decentralize and flatten previous hierarchical societal constructs, can this new synthetic universe of the blockchain actually free her because inherently web3 hopes to disrupt and remove bureaucracy? Perhaps in effect she will be more free here than the gender bias that has been instilled previously?** \n\n**WHITAKER:** I would be shocked if Web3 will ultimately be spared the structural biases of the real world but I love your optimism! There’s a lot I don’t understand about Web3 but I don’t think anything made by people who developed consciousness in a flawed world (ie everyone) can really escape it. \n\n**ARCHER: With NFT culture highlighting digital, generative AI-driven art like nothing ever before in history, have these new technological paradigms inspired any thoughts on how you might introduce this into your own work? Have you ever considered implementing an actual AI process or forms of automation into your work processes that removes some of your control as an artist?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** The 4x5 film process started out as a way to remove some of my control as an artist. At the time I was thinking a lot about John Cage’s chance operations. But now that I’m working with a digital camera making conventional photographs, I don’t see myself relinquishing control any time soon. I’m really interested in photography as a medium–it’s history, its influence on culture, its power to seduce. In that sense, I’m still very interested in making my own specific kind of photographs. I want the images I make to comment on contemporary life but also relate to some of the images that I drew from– like album art from the 70s, or fashion photography from the 60s, or posters from the 80s.  \n \n\n**ARCHER: Apparently, Siri got her name after the Norwegian name that means \"beautiful woman who leads you to victory,\" can I ask why “Ursula?” \n WHITAKER:** I have also heard that Siri was named for a specific woman – a Norwegian meteorologist named Siri Kalvig. I chose the name Ursula for a few reasons. I liked that it's a name that feels both old fashioned and futuristic at the same time. It’s also frightened by a lot of associations– the witch from the Little Mermaid, Ursula le Guin the feminisit sci-fi writer, and Ursula Andress a Swiss actress/bond girl/sex symbol. The triangulation of the villain, sci-fi, and iconic beauty seemed about right.\n\n![Ursula 3 #11 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ccTQu0yBF57_7XnR0gVSk.jpg?height=1024&width=758&size=medium)\n\n**ARCHER: What are you most excited about with what the blockchain offers for artists and what Obscura is doing in partnership with your future path?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Obscura basically funded the making of a ton of new work with no strings attached. I had total creative freedom. That’s never happened to me before in my entire career and it felt amazing. In general what I’m most excited about is the availability of new models of living and working for artists. I still operate in and appreciate the legacy art world but few would argue that it serves all artists well. I’m all for the creation of new income streams for artists, new opportunities for discourse about art, and new forms of community-building.\n\n![Ursula 3 #22 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dgllesZkOdyFkx1KNY4D6.jpg?height=1024&width=758&size=medium)\n\n**To view the full collection** of Hannah Whitaker’s Obscura Commissioned drop:\n\n[https://obscura.io/collections/hannah-whitaker](https://obscura.io/collections/hannah-whitaker)\n\n**To view other NFT works** of the artist: \n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/hannahwhitaker-ursula](https://opensea.io/collection/hannahwhitaker-ursula)\n\n \n **Follow Hannah Whitaker** on Twitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/_hannahwhitaker](https://twitter.com/_hannahwhitaker)\n\n \n **Follow Obscura DAO** on Twitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/obscuradao](https://twitter.com/obscuradao)\n\n \n \n\nJoin the **Obscura Discord:**\n\n[https://discord.com/invite/obscura](https://discord.com/invite/obscura)\n\n \n Want to **Contribute to the Obscura DAO?**\n\n[https://airtable.com/shrgZ0BhGA0stsqik](https://airtable.com/shrgZ0BhGA0stsqik)\n\n \n Want to **Partner with Obscura?**\n\n[https://airtable.com/shr0qRDmFLro3V7i9](https://airtable.com/shr0qRDmFLro3V7i9)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654281697, "digest": "4hdx1pzHlhOTzQ5aAGCi0e7eQQtXu9r1hU1NpLD2K9I", "contributor": "0xFda746F4C3f9F5A02b3E63ed6d0eBBc002d1f788"}

{"id": "MyWGLVM16IQR4VcWCszy6Fis1EdIkBrcN4dCH1jx_uo", "title": "Studying the Optimism Collective", "body": "***Disclosure: You may already be a winner of the*** ***[$OP token sweepstakes](https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/check). I am serving as a delegate for the Optimism Token House.***\n\nThis week Optimism dropped the $OP token, initiating Optimism Governance. Optimism’s governance system presents an exciting opportunity to study the latest thinking in governance design and helps us focus on shaping the next era of Web3 through its focus on public goods. With the launch of the token, Optimism created the Optimism Collective, an ecosystem that will govern the distribution of public goods funding derived from the revenue the protocol generates. The Optimism Collective is governed by three bodies: the Token House (holders of $OP), the Citizens’ House (select NFT holders), and the Foundation. Optimism’s structure is notable for its balance of power between the three governing bodies, the use of multiple voting styles (token-weighted and one-person, one-vote), and the Collective’s commitment to experimentation.\n\n*What is Optimism?*\n\nOptimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is an optimistic rollup: it is optimistic, because it assumes transactions submitted to it by users are valid; it is a rollup, because it sequences transactions off of Ethereum and periodically submits a merkle root of the transactions to Ethereum to create a resulting state change. Given that Optimism’s sequencer does not ensure the same security as Ethereum, Optimism creates a dispute period after its sequencer publishes a batch of transactions, during which a party can challenge a state change with a fault proof (for a reward) which will prevent the state change from being committed to Ethereum. Optimism is the first layer 2 to achieve EVM equivalence, meaning that there is no difference between how smart contracts are executed on L2 and L1, which makes deployment on Optimism easier.\n\n*The Optimism Collective — Mission*\n\nThe Optimism Collective is guided by a vision of “sustainably fund\\[ing\\] those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond.” In essence, Optimism is devoting protocol revenue tokenholders and trusted stewards of the community to fund public goods projects that create compounding value for Optimism and eventually Web3 and broader society. The Collective was created with a view toward making public goods creation profitable, meaning “impact=profit.” The Collective seeks to achieve its mission by funding public goods both proactively and retroactively. Proactive funding encourages innovation and risk-taking in the pursuit of public goods; retroactive funding ensures that impactful projects are rewarded.\n\n*Balance of Power*\n\nOptimism seeks to balance the short-term and long-term views of the community by balancing power between the Token House, the Citizens’ House, and the Foundation.\n\n![Optimism Governance Overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*V9XR86iMDooYoZBg.jpeg)\n\nThe Token House is entrusted to make determinations about project incentives, protocol upgrades, and the appropriation of treasury funds to the Foundation. By leveraging the collective knowledge of the Token House, the Collective is able to improve the predictive power of its grants and adjust to the specific needs of the Optimism community. The democratic aspect of the Token House ensures that the users of the protocol have representation in determining the future of the protocol’s mission and function.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will focus on retroactive public goods funding. Citizens will be selected from the community; their citizenship is non-transferrable. By selecting individuals who have demonstrated value to the Optimism ecosystem, the Collective will increase the likelihood that retroactive funding represents true value provided to the community. Having a consistency of identity creates continuity in criteria and makes long-term decision-making possible. The method for selecting Citizens will be determined by the Foundation in consultation with the Token House.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is the steward of the Collective. It oversees the administration of governance, allocates treasury assets (including the distribution of $OP), vetoes malicious proposals, and has the power to amend the Constitution. The Foundation has many stabilizing powers for the community, yet its capabilities remain in check by the Token House. The Token House can remove directors from the Foundation and veto changes to the founding documents that would materially impair tokenholders’ rights.\n\n*Mixed Voting*\n\nThe Token House and Citizens’ House have different forms of voting to suit different functions. The Token House votes on a token-weighted basis. As in any token-weighted system, Token House voting is susceptible to plutocratic concentration of power and voter apathy. The Token House permits tokenholders to delegate their votes to stewards who have made public commitments to act as stewards for the Collective. Delegation may mitigate the power of individual holders who have high concentrations of power by enabling smaller holders to pool their votes through a delegate. Delegation also ensures that there are members of the community who are dedicated to participating in governance, mitigating the chance that small groups can collude to pass self-interested proposals with a quorum.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will operate through a one-person, one-vote system. Presuming that Citizens are chosen based on their specific insights and dedication to the ecosystem, the one-person, one-vote structure is sensible: newly minted citizens will have equal footing with incumbents for decision-making. In addition to preventing plutocratic domination, a non-transferrable one-person, one-vote system will avoid the volatility that accompanies rapid transfer of liquid governance tokens.\n\nBringing a token-weighted system together with a one-person, one-vote system creates a balance between the short-term and the long-term as well as between the prospective and retroactive. Both Houses come together to determine the Optimism network parameters, which affects the balance between transaction volume on the Optimism network and funding supply for retroactive public goods funding. This balance keeps the present and future health of the protocol fairly represented: tokenholders are not unfairly called upon to subsidize large-scale infrastructural projects, while citizens have a voice in projecting long-term funding needs to improve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n*Experimentation*\n\nOptimism’s Working Constitution is brief, but the first principle is “a commitment to experimentation.” Projects that have a need for a complex beginning also have a need for flexibility. At the point of initiation, the Optimism community can only match an understanding of their needs with governance theory and the knowledge of how other DAOs have succeeded and failed. To ensure the success of the governance process, the community needs to commit to a flexible system in order to test theory with community-specific data. By focusing on experimentation, Optimism will collect important data on what principles and rules best suit the mission of funding public goods and use that data to create a better fit between the Collective’s mission and its procedure.\n\nEarly experimentation mitigates path-dependency. By maintaining a commitment to testing theories, the community encourages honesty about the value of the governance systems it tries. A collective mindset of flexibility also encourages the community to innovate, as the cost of failure is lowered and the value of the data collected is high. If early rules are rigid, systems may proceed despite inefficiencies and flaws in the early design, and the longer the flaws linger, the more difficult it becomes to remedy them in the future.\n\nThe results of the Collective’s experiments will be public goods in themselves. Optimism will be highly visible given its critical role in scaling Ethereum, which means that its governance process will be on display for other communities that are working hard to discover the appropriate mission-governance fit. Each pitfall and success will update the Web3 community’s knowledge of how to construct a long-term sustainable system of ordering the relationships between tokenholders and their rights.\n\n*Moving Forward*\n\nFor those who are looking to design governance systems for their own projects, it is worthwhile to observe Optimism’s governance process as it proceeds. The Optimism Collective combines the learnings of the last few years of DAO design and adds new structures that may succeed or fail. As you observe Optimism’s experiment, as with your own, watch for whether its structure progresses in line with its mission. See whether the balance of power remains stable or whether power collects too heavily in one place. Consider whether the community takes advantage of the opportunity to try different structures, and whether the experiments result in the community taking tangible actions based on their findings.", "timestamp": 1654281869, "digest": "bjA8cQKssBxOTHYaVAbstu2xdH0FSoeUS-0qFG9rBfQ", "contributor": "0x367B4bDf414Df673Df0129838ebfB9913147427F"}

{"id": "igRYV_EDSE4XLXIh3fm69Jcl06onrEBIbnhKJKVohQc", "title": "UST - not so Stablecoin ", "body": "## Introduction\n\nThis May wasn’t specifically good for the **Web3.0** space. Market took a good hit, portfolios came down, people lost money. All this happened within a week. No - one before had imagined that a blockchain can be attacked and forced to be halted.\n\nWell that’s what happened to the **TERRA** network. Its native token LUNA lost 100% of its value.\n\n![LUNA Market history over past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_a6dKTArZU9hpPtcX9tbV.png?height=382&width=488)\n\n## Stable Coins\n\nThere are two types of currencies in blockchain, one that you want to increase in prices i.e. the native tokens so that you can gain high ROI’s e.g. Ether, BTC etc. Other one is stablecoins, you want these to stay near 1$ i.e. their initial pegging. They are programmed in such a way that they stay low. They are considered the safe channel if you want to go long on your assets. For a better understanding, you can relate them with government securities in terms of traditional trading, they don’t offer high ROI’s but profits are guaranteed even if they are low. There are many such tokens as Tether’s USDT, or US Center government’s USDC.\n\n## UST - LUNA\n\nLike USDT, USDC, **TERRA** network has its own stablecoin UST. Now unlike other stablecoins, which are backed up by liquidity in form of real money in the banks, UST is an algorithmically stable coin. Do Kwon, founder of the Terra network, designed this token. As per the theory, UST is 1:1 pegged to Terra’s LUNA. It means UST holders can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA by burning the UST and minting LUNA.\n\n## Attack Phase - 1\n\nUST doesn’t have any other utility other than Terra’s most popular [Anchor Protocol](https://www.anchorprotocol.com/#). Anchor offers 20% yield for deposits, this is far more than any other protocol. But this deal is only effective to the UST, no other stablecoins, be it USDC, USDT.\n\nAs per April end, 72% of all the UST was locked into Anchor, estimated around 14 billion dollars.\n\nImagine a bank offering 20% interest on your deposits, obviously everyone would go to that bank and earn that pretty money. That’s what happened with Anchor, as the time passed, the number of lenders increased, but the number of borrowers kept decreasing, in this case a proposal was drawn and it was clear that those pretty 20% interest rates were not going to stand.\n\nAfter hearing the news, people started pulling their locked UST out from Anchor.

He often flashes in our season reviews, and if you missed his interview for [NewsBTC](https://newsbtc.xyz/article/an-interview-with-ivica-simatovic-oaziz-dao-contributor-bin18369), here it is.\n\nIvica is a true veteran of the blockchain industry: he rocks more than a decade of blockchain experience and 20+ years of development experience. He has such eminent companies as Sony, Mercedes, and Telecom on his career list. He launched his first GameFi project over 10(!) years ago. Ivica is an ardent fan of decentralization, a wizard of blockchain development and a true master of his craft.\n\nIvica commented on his reasons to join Oaziz:\n\n> OazizDAO was a concept that inspired me. A form of sociocracy that enables growth with an interactive exchange of values, transactions and information.\n\nAlthough the concept of Oaziz is still being developed, Ivica already knows what it will look like:\n\n> Oaziz should become a place for people to get together, share ideas, build, create and feel somewhat like their virtual home.\n\nWith Ivica, you can be sure that the technical part of Oaziz is in the right hands.\n\nP.S. And if you want to hear from Ivica more often - just follow him on [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/IvicaSimatovic) :)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/emOJcHq9J3ZufYJ1h1Z9D.jpeg?height=408&width=408)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654282200, "digest": "L_TqLbJVqjWlySeKnro9MbDPGE9ZoUqzLpYmQ6cuD0Y", "contributor": "0xCdA29ff08464a66b1c8437e7dE780c1d02907688"}
{"id": "kruaili-Ypsws-rOuAeLrt3S0U8TQh6UH-12oqtVpfk", "title": "UST- not so Stablecoin ", "body": "## Introduction\n\nThis May wasn’t specifically good for the **Web3.0** space. Market took a good hit, portfolios came down, people lost money. All this happened within a week. No-one before had imagined that a blockchain can be attacked and forced to be halted.\n\nWell that’s what happened to the **TERRA** network. Its native token LUNA lost 100% of its value.\n\n![LUNA Market history over past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_a6dKTArZU9hpPtcX9tbV.png?height=382&width=488)\n\n## Stable Coins\n\nThere are two types of currencies in blockchain, one that you want to increase in prices i.e. the native tokens so that you can gain high ROI’s e.g. Ether, BTC etc. Other one is stable-coins, you want these to stay near 1$ i.e. their initial pegging. They are programmed in such a way that they stay low. They are considered the safe channel if you want to go long on your assets. For a better understanding, you can relate them with government securities in terms of traditional trading, they don’t offer high ROI’s but profits are guaranteed even if they are low. There are many such tokens as Tether’s USD, or US Center government’s USDC\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n## UST-LUNA\n\nLike USDT, USDC, **TERRA** network has its own stable-coin UST. Now unlike other stable-coins, which are backed up by liquidity in form of real money in the banks, UST is an algorithmically stable coin. Do Kwon, founder of the Terra network, designed this token. As per the theory, UST is 1:1 pegged to Terra’s LUNA. It means UST holders can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA by burning the UST and minting LUNA.\n\n## Attack Phase -1\n\nUST doesn’t have any other utility other than Terra’s most popular [Anchor Protocol](https://www.anchorprotocol.com/#). Anchor offers 20% yield for deposits, this is far more than any other protocol. But this deal is only effective to the UST, no other stable-coins, be it USDC, USDT.\n\nAs per April end, 72% of all the UST was locked into Anchor, estimated around 14 billion dollars.\n\nImagine a bank offering 20% interest on your deposits, obviously everyone would go to that bank and earn that pretty money. That’s what happened with Anchor, as the time passed, the number of lenders increased, but the number of borrowers kept decreasing, in this case a proposal was drawn and it was clear that those pretty 20% interest rates were not going to stand.\n\nAfter hearing the news, people started pulling their locked UST out from Anchor. Since there is no other use of UST, people started getting out of the Terra network\n\n[Anchor Docs](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/)\n\n## Attack Phase -2\n\nNow to exit UST, there are two options, one- the inbuilt burn and mint mechanism, where one can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA, Second option is stable-coin exchange, Curve Finance.\n\nCurve provides liquidity pools for stable coins, same existed for UST too, specifically (UST+3crv pool).\n\nWhen people took out their UST they started swapping it into the curve pool. It increased the amount of UST and decreased the amount of other stable-coins, resulting in the destabilization of the pool.\n\nTo make things worse, at least one individual dumped about $85 Million worth UST tokens, and exchanged them for USDC. This created an imbalance in the pool. Now to tip the scales back, according to the protocols, Anchor starts offering UST at a discounted price. This was the initial step in de-pegging of UST.

{"id": "4c6_BlsNR4GfjCcKPcb03y0FZzsyfYL1jj43Wd5Q8zQ", "title": "和王慧文在他的李想车里聊了90分钟，contain Web3", "body": "Twitter: @26x14eth\n\n因为我没能及时做核酸，原本定在望京某酒店的聚点临时变到了车里。\n\n这次会面的由头是Multicoin Capital的Founding Partner Kyle Samnai在Twitter上的一条内容，关于Airbnb模式的Web3机会。Kyle在Twitter上急呼相关模式的Web3创业者，并带着鲜明的积极和拥抱。王慧文的看法是：Airbnb是上一波O2O里面经营复杂度相对较低的，但online的业务模式似乎比offline更容易被Web3改造。\n\n今年年初开始，王慧文在即刻上发出了多条与Web3有关的动态，被业界视为是能帮助Web3进行资本破圈的又一大佬。但见面之后，他告诉我，近期对Web3的关注度已经有所减缓。一是，没有想明白X to Earn或NFT的付费场景除了游戏之外还有哪些；另一个是，很多Defi产品在除了提供流动性之外缺乏价值和算法支撑。“号称算法稳定币的Luna，它的算法到底在哪？”他尝试重复且微笑的发问，我知道他显然已有自己的答案。\n\n“我在Web3还没有怎么投资”，他身体斜向背椅靠去，“我也没有团队，就我一个人”。数月前，他刚从香港回来，在那见过很多做Defi的朋友，未来也会保持见人的频次。而最近，他开始把更多的注意力从Web3转向了股票的二级市场。\n\n“现在的中概股，如果从未来5年回头来看，会产生很多的十倍股，A股也有很大的机会。”比如拼多多，最低的时候居然才300多亿美金市值（当前660亿美金左右）。王慧文认为，如今的中概股从情绪面已经很难有更差的时候了。\n\n我们也聊了滴滴，私有化和再上市的猜想。聊了美团当年做打车为何没有继续，聊了美团为什么没逢低买下滴滴。这些话题因为敏感度就不在此展开了。但王慧文对滴滴的后市判断是乐观的，我们也都希望滴滴能好。\n\n说到腾讯。它可能是另一个逻辑，不必苛求和追问腾讯下一个十年的增长引擎是什么，但它至少是一个安全的存在，拥有腾讯股票就像买了一个长期的保险类产品。类似的逻辑还有美团。美团提供民生相关的基础设施和服务，对就业率的吸纳和贡献很大。王慧文说，自己至今还没怎么卖过美团股票，之前网上传闻的卖股很大部分是和税收处理相关，“有王兴在那，他相当于起到了一个很好的基金经理，我为什么要卖？”\n\n王慧文看好当前二级市场的估值洼地，但他也并没有进行怎样的主动型配置。他解释说，股市仍然属于风险型资产，而他本人不是一个风险敞口较宽的风格。这样的风格也体现在早前他对理想汽车的投资上。本来当时是想拿出1亿美金投三家（李想、小鹏、蔚来），但因为个人资金很大程度拴在美团股票上，没有那么多钱，最后的几千万美金是借来投理想。而三家里面选择理想，很大程度是出于更信任这个人。王慧文说，小鹏的软件算法非常厉害，李斌也合作过，但李想给我的感觉最稳。而这个“稳”，也非常匹配汽车这条赛道。\n\n可能现在再从0开始做（造车），时机会有些被动，手机厂商入局会怎样，还需要观察观察。不过，这并不影响他对新能源赛道宏观层面的热切信心。“新能源汽车的未来格局将由中、美来主导。”为什么不看好日本？日本在历史上经常押错路线，这和日本的岛内资源、内生经济有很大关系，它不像美国，也不像中国，日本的很多决策似乎也并不以“第一性原理”作为优先级。\n\n王慧文认为，日本选氢燃料做新能源车，是一个错误的路径，也许你技术更稍显优越性，但现在人家锂电池已经跑起来了，规模和势能已经起来了，产业链怎么会选择你？这不是一个技术唯一驱动的业态。一个长线的投入，过早入局，或许是一个深坑。\n\n与一些科技大佬不同，王慧文并不是一个特斯拉信徒，尽管他看好特斯拉的成长空间仍有数倍。在他看来，美国式教育让美国创业者更懂得如何使用PR和营销，这和美国的资源工具优厚有关，调配资源的能力对美国人来说，比执行力有更为重要的作用和效率。尽管Elon Musk很优秀，但他在PR上的优势远远高于他在产品、技术上的相对优势。\n\n此外，媒体舆论也过于放大了算法的作用。王慧文认为，在相当长一段时间内，新能源车的核心仍然在于“电动”本身，后面才是算法。所以你看，比亚迪就很厉害。\n\n“退休”之后，王慧文说自己最大的乐趣和精力是在于对“宏观”的思索和琢磨。“你有没有听过芒格的Lollapalooza理论？”，“你是否知道文明和野蛮的区分？”，“我很多香港和新加坡的朋友认为普京是野蛮人，那你觉得他算是文明还是野蛮？”，“达里奥曾预测过美国会发生内战，尽管我认为可能性很低，但你有没有想过如果美国内战，这个会是怎样的方式打起来呢？”\n\n我极大的乐趣在倾听他对于“宏观”的思辨和相对独立的逻辑体系。他拨弄着墨镜，时而戴上时而摘下，不变的是淡淡而狡黠的微笑。想起一位老美团的朋友曾评价他说，清华电子系的老王如果当年转攻哲学也一样能将对手摧枯拉朽，他的“王式哲学”自成一派。而我仍能记住之前在微信上的一次对话，他说“做业务，要讲究新人做老事，老人做新事”，这句话一晃5年了，至今让我深刻。", "timestamp": 1654282570, "digest": "CXqu0kg9AVMQUiIIb9FYsrYNYQmaxlMH9_xWokw-mEE", "contributor": "0x1eAf4d367b7a4685160857e6e99b6325DE22fEEc"}

{"id": "J3r6OHUtbfjJlHrTFMUCwXIVEjzx8_80ARyJAw90noM", "title": "UST - not so Stablecoin ", "body": "## Introduction\n\nThis May wasn’t specifically good for the **Web3.0** space. Market took a good hit, portfolios came down, people lost money. All this happened within a week. No - one before had imagined that a blockchain can be attacked and forced to be halted.\n\nWell that’s what happened to the **TERRA** network. Its native token LUNA lost 100% of its value.\n\n![LUNA Market history over past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_a6dKTArZU9hpPtcX9tbV.png?height=382&width=488)\n\n## Stable Coins\n\nThere are two types of currencies in blockchain, one that you want to increase in prices i.e. the native tokens so that you can gain high ROI’s e.g. Ether, BTC etc. Other one is stablecoins, you want these to stay near 1$ i.e. their initial pegging. They are programmed in such a way that they stay low. They are considered the safe channel if you want to go long on your assets. For a better understanding, you can relate them with government securities in terms of traditional trading, they don’t offer high ROI’s but profits are guaranteed even if they are low. There are many such tokens as Tether’s USDT, or US Center government’s USDC.\n\n## UST - LUNA\n\nLike USDT, USDC, **TERRA** network has its own stablecoin UST. Now unlike other stablecoins, which are backed up by liquidity in form of real money in the banks, UST is an algorithmically stable coin. Do Kwon, founder of the Terra network, designed this token. As per the theory, UST is 1:1 pegged to Terra’s LUNA. It means UST holders can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA by burning the UST and minting LUNA.\n\n## Attack Phase - 1\n\nUST doesn’t have any other utility other than Terra’s most popular [Anchor Protocol](https://www.anchorprotocol.com/#). Anchor offers 20% yield for deposits, this is far more than any other protocol. But this deal is only effective to the UST, no other stablecoins, be it USDC, USDT.\n\nAs per April end, 72% of all the UST was locked into Anchor, estimated around 14 billion dollars.\n\nImagine a bank offering 20% interest on your deposits, obviously everyone would go to that bank and earn that pretty money. That’s what happened with Anchor, as the time passed, the number of lenders increased, but the number of borrowers kept decreasing, in this case a proposal was drawn and it was clear that those pretty 20% interest rates were not going to stand.\n\nAfter hearing the news, people started pulling their locked UST out from Anchor. Since there is no other use of UST, people started getting out of the Terra network\n\n[Anchor Docs](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/)\n\n## Attack Phase - 2\n\nNow to exit UST, there are two options, one - the inbuilt burn and mint mechanism, where one can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA, Second option is stablecoin exchange, Curve Finance.\n\nCurve provides liquidity pools for stable coins, same existed for UST too, specifically (UST+3crv pool).\n\nWhen people took out their UST they started swapping it into the curve pool. It increased the amount of UST and decreased the amount of other stablecoins, resulting in the destabilization of the pool.\n\nTo make things worse, at least one individual dumped about $85 Million worth UST tokens, and exchanged them for USDC. This created an imbalance in the pool. Now to tip the scales back, according to the protocols, Anchor starts offering UST at a discounted price. This was the initial step in de - pegging of UST. This eventually resulted in the drowning of LUNA in the market.\n\n![Transaction showing deposit of $85 Million worth UST](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8i8MY1SsFCuLvCtGvj89p.png?height=390&width=600)\n\n## Attack Phase - 3\n\nEvery blockchain has a safe guard which steps in at the moment of crisis. Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) was Terra’s shield in this case. It dumped non - UST stable - coins worth approximately $216 Million into the curve pool to regain the balance. This technique did work for sometime but the prices continued to degrade as people continued to get out of Terra. Panic played a crucial role in the plummeting of the Market, traders/investors lost their trust in Terra.\n\nNow to compensate for the loss in the portfolios, people started selling their other assets to absorb the shock. This resulted in the falling of the market altogether.\n\nDo Kwon had already thought about any incident of such kind, some time later after launching UST, he started buying Bitcoin as safe reserves. But those reserves were not enough to compensate for the destruction.\n\nThis kind of attack forced the blockchain to halt, a decision collectively taken by all the nodes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter the whole month of analyzing , it’s safe to say that we still are at a very early stage, there’s a lot to learn, a lot to unravel, a lot to study. One has to take every step very cautiously because it’s real money at stake here.", "timestamp": 1654283263, "digest": "Xup_PA8A5ZGz0bA_7TKb8sp8GgSPuJWSQ-qn00aSnWI", "contributor": "0xC6036B8c3F911f936b661a075CFAA4B802b75cc3"}

Таксите за транзакции на L1 са много високи от месеци и има по-голяма спешност да се направи всичко необходимо, за да се улесни преминаването към **RollUps** в цялата екосистема.\n\n* *Ниски такси*\n\nРазбиването (sharding) на данни ще отнеме значително време, за да завърши внедряването, но **Rollups вече са тук**. **EIP-4844** може да намали сборните такси с порядък и да позволи на **Ethereum** да остане конкурентоспособен и ефикасен, без да жертва децентрализацията.\n\n### 🏄🏾‍♀️Откриване на нови хоризонти🏄🏾‍♀️\n\nИма много завладяващи възможности, които могат да бъдат активирани от **Dank-sharding**. Имайте впредвид, че не съм Blochchain Dev разработчик или технически запознат с кода на **EIP-4844**, но спекулирам с това, което може да излезне като позитив! :\n\n1. С функцията **crLists (обяснена във видеото),** потенциално бихте могли да имате незабавни предварителни потвърждения за транзакции от L1. (Няма повече чакане на блокове за потвърждение!)\n2. Отваря възможността за надграждане на текущия слой за изпълнение на Ethereum (execution layer) да бъде към RollUp. Първо като **Optimistic Rollup** с доказателства за липса на измами, в крайна сметка като прикрепен **ZkRollup с zkEVM**.\n3. Така че, като се има предвид всичко по-горе, вие трябва да се замислите за различните нови възможности, които не сте обмисляли преди. Ето една възможност : може ли това да отвори възможността за **[кръстосано набиране (cross-chain)](https://zkmurton.substack.com/p/multi-chain-vs-cross-chain)** съвместимост между множество ZKR?!\n\n🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️ Това със сигурност е възможно между множество вериги в една и съща **ZKR** мрежа (например **StarkNet L3s**) - но какво ще стане, ако е между **StarkNet L3 и zkSync L2**? Могат ли предварителните потвърждения на **crList** да позволят на **ZKR** да свързват транзакции една върху друга, като всички потвърждават в рамките на един и същи блок?\n\nЗа да бъде ясно, има много работа, която трябва да се свърши, но се смята, че това наистина е ***най-вълнуващото нещо, което се е случило в протоколите на блокчейн***, откакто са въведни за Rollups и извадката за наличност на данни(data availability sampling). Повече инфо: [ТУК](https://polynya.medium.com/danksharding-36dc0c8067fe)\n\n\n---\n\nВъпреки, че на теория Dank-sharding звучи напълно разумно, все още има доста работа да бъде отметната.

Otherwise, it was business as usual at Rehash DAO, and we’ll share some of the highlights below.\n\n## Two new podcast episodes this week 🎙️\n\nKeeping with our Tuesday/Thursday podcast release schedule, we published two new episodes this week featuring conversations with Gary Sheng from Dream DAO and Civics Unplugged and Dayo Adeosun from Glass Protocol.\n\n[https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1531309120166342657?s=20&t=p81WsqZNRp76fLNgvRZqhg](https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1531309120166342657?s=20&t=p81WsqZNRp76fLNgvRZqhg)\n\n### Rehash Episode 2: Regenerating Communities & Our Planet w/Gary Sheng \n\nGary is the founder of Dream DAO and Civics Unplugged and is passionate about applying regenerative models to web3. He talks about what “regen” means to him, why inclusivity in web3 is important, what a solarpunk future looks like, and why he believes gen z can make the largest impact on web3.\n\n[https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1531674643441909761?s=20&t=p81WsqZNRp76fLNgvRZqhg](https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1531674643441909761?s=20&t=p81WsqZNRp76fLNgvRZqhg)\n\nYou can listen to the full episode on [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/regenerating-communities-our-planet-w-gary-sheng/id1620436349?i=1000564654708), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2a8RI2AmCjxjvRPorczwVR?si=srkWC7tTSYqSQSp7IAJBKw), or wherever you get your podcasts.

These workstreams are accessible (read & write) to NFT holders on Discord and viewable (read only) by the public. \n\nThis week, we’ve been focused on working through some of the questions we posed last week, especially with regards to membership. One question we’ve heard from you the most is with regards to contribution.\n\n### What are some ways in which people can contribute to the DAO today?\n\nFor our existing NFT holders, the two main ways you can contribute today are:\n\n* **Promotion** - creating summary threads, RTing, posting on reddit, creating their own promo audio/video clips, pulling quotes from episodes, \"good Twitter shilling\", leading Discord discussions, etc. to get more people talking about Rehash\n* **Process** - helping us nail down our governance and org structure, document processes, and stay organized\n\nFor people who missed our [crowdfund](https://rehash.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0xa3659D161757C6c88e667CC022B93bcCfa01dB27) and want to contribute, we’ll be releasing a typeform in the next week that you can fill out to get onboarded to Rehash DAO. \n\n## Meme of the Week 😂\n\nOur meme of the week features Matt Gould, our guest on Episode 1 of Season 2. Check it out below:\n\n[https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1532078507765153793?s=20&t=p81WsqZNRp76fLNgvRZqhg](https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1532078507765153793?s=20&t=p81WsqZNRp76fLNgvRZqhg)\n\nWe like the memes!\n\nIf you have any feedback or ideas, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9mrS8PmRh4) and chat with us!\n\nSee you next week ✌️", "timestamp": 1654283431, "digest": "BhzReux0Uf9v9NWYLibgwtlxbeyDz8kskfJPgwe8Tgc", "contributor": "0xcEd09CCFc82b091195bdE04E6Cd65374518E7b95"}

As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery, farm, hash processing, and soon-to-launch retail of award-winning legacy products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks.

We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654284014, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem : Removing the Gatekeepers in Tech, Finance, & Culture**\n\nHighly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Creating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption. Information, data security, and their applications are essential for business optimization and transparency. Although there are many ERP solutions for the industry already, our governance will be centered around cannabis supply chain and DeFi dApps that utilize NFT-based SKU’s to generate active product data and create on-chain interactions that comply with ESG metrics, paving the way for global regulations and the future of the cannabis space.\n\nDeveloping Horticulture Public Goods : BIPOC Horticulture Initiative, Open-Source Library of Genetics, Strains and Phenos, Regenerative Farming Methods & Techniques, Cannabis Production, Processing, Entheogenic Cultivation, Medicinal Protocols, and a Community-Practitioner Directory\n\nCommunity-Governance over the liquidity, yield-farming, and major-user decisions in the tokenization of HASH DAO.\n\nHASH DAO Governance is the future of the industry standard, and to do this we will start by partnering with one successful Emerald Triangle, Northern California craft cannabis-brand with community-staking of its future scaling of operations and expanding a compilation of automation protocols through smart contracts.\n\n**ON-CHAIN SUPPLY NFTs + ACTIVE INVENTORY TRACKING + CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS = Web3 Point of Sale (PoS)**\n\n**World’s First Cannabis DAO Founded On**:\n\nBIPOC-equity and engineered around community-development governed by craft cannabis operators, backed by IRL projects.\n\n**On-Chain Protocols + Smart Contracts = The Automated Horticulture of Tomorrow**\n\nCreating a future:\n\n* Geared to the love and cultivation of the plant and Mother Earth\n* Onboarding BIPOC leaders and creatives onto the blockchain\n* Compensating intellectual property proportionally to fulfill smart contracts\n\n> **HASH DAO = Power Back in Your Hands**\n\nReinvention of the Horticulture Supply Chain and Data Distribution via smart contracts that allow for automation and help individuals to create ownership over community-led projects, intellectual property, digital assets, and dApps.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M6C2p0sNHx37p783TEv9D.jpg?height=822&width=1125)\n\n**First Wins for HASH DAO**\n\n> “Community Ownership of Physical and Digital Assets”\n\nMinting a multi-tiered HASH DAO NFT with the top governance tier going for $10 K, raising a total of $11.5 M for an initial $HASH treasury. As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery, farm, hash processing, and soon-to-launch retail of award-winning legacy products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks.

Specifically, these Victorian-themed tuckshops and sweet connoisseurs, plucked from two hundred years prior and plopped in the middle of a high street that doesn’t quite know how to welcome its new tenant. One of the sweet shops near me plasters ‘Toys, Trains, Treats” on dated storefront panelling; it’s the shop you thought your grandparents went to when they were young, except the steam trains on sale are battery powered.\n\nThis wasn’t just a Baader–Meinhof [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion), where upon seeing something once you perceive it everywhere. During the first year of the pandemic, an extra [73](https://www.mylondon.news/news/uk-world-news/i-visited-londons-new-dangerous-22961908#:\\~:text=73%20more%20sweet%20shops%20in%20the%20uk%20compared%20with%202020) sweetshops popped up in the UK, net, according to the Local Data Company. That’s not a huge number, but it’s pretty significant given the broader lockdown context; the total number of clothing shops fell by 1,236 in the same period[1](#footnote-1). The shop near me was set up in September ‘21. It begs the question: what’s so special about sweet shops?\n\nI had spent my Saturday morning at Waterstones buying some books, at the sweet shop questioning the shop assistant, and now I’m writing about it on Substack. In days gone by, I would have bought my physical items at Sainsbury’s and, in comparison to today, where I have my Substack and my main [website](https://www.leonasskau.co.uk/), all my digital publishing would be through the same technology stack, probably Wordpress.\n\nI mean, you get what I’m saying, despite the weird animojis, right? ([HelloDorking](https://twitter.com/HelloDorking/status/1305174859287326721/photo/1))\n\nSweets are nice, but the real difference is the existence of a shop that will focus all of its resources on their specific niche product. I bought some weird caramel chocolate flakes that defy description, but they were excellent. I certainly paid a premium, but next time I want sweets, I’ll go there again, because *they know their product*; I just bought what the shop assistant recommended. At Waterstone’s, I picked up [Train Dreams](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/13/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review) because I told the manager I was after contemporary fiction; I use Substack because it’s built for writers[2](#footnote-2). **What makes these businesses special is that they serve *niche markets in which they can give people much deeper value.***\n\n![I mean, you get what I’m saying, despite the weird animojis, right? (HelloDorking)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xRINH9-26W7ZvCggFpXtm.jpeg?height=2438&width=3024)\n\n## Unbundling into niches\n\nBundling and unbundling are [not new concepts](https://hbr.org/1999/03/unbundling-the-corporation). It’s a pretty simple convection model: you start with a business, over time you add more products, services, and features, and then you get bloated, do everything ‘kinda well’, until a niche competitor comes along and does *one* of your services *really really well*, and bit by bit you get pieced apart. The [complexity convection](https://every.to/divinations/complexity-convection-765851) is a pattern that cannot be unseen. \n\nPeople have observed this happening to our contemporary digital landscape for about a decade, beginning in practice much earlier. Craigslist was [unbundled](https://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/345941486/the-spawn-of-craigslist-like-most-vcs-that-focus) into many things, including Reddit, which is now being [unbundled](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit?s=r) into many more things, like Nextdoor. In the language of [a16z](https://a16z.com/2019/09/11/platforms-verticals-unbundling/), the famed tech investors: platforms get unbundled into verticals, which turn into platforms, at which point the cycle resumes, and all of a sudden I’ve turned into a strategy writer[3](#footnote-3). \n\nI’m not the first to herald this unbundling in the physical world either. Peter Day [wrote](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=Economy%2C%20%20almost%20a,speed%20and%20efficiency.) an excellent essay predicting “the heartbeat economy, almost a concierge approach to customers,” in 2013:\n\n> `“This would be a worryingly intimate relationship for many businesses, but one which might provide a new kind of rewarding marketplace if they dared to be far closer to their customers' individuality.”`\n\nHe wrote about it in the BBC, but today he would write on his own blog.\n\nMy real contribution is to note that this challenges why unbundling and bundling happens at all. The main idea behind why we sway between bundled and unbundled products is the [underlying technology](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling#:\\~:text=a%20lot%20of%20it%20is%20based%20on%20the%20underlying%20technology%20change). Marc Andreesen, co-founder of a16z and of [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)), the first web browser, talks through the concept of the newspaper:\n\n> `“The newspaper bundle, the idea of this slug of news and sports scores and classifieds and stock quotes that arrives once a day was a consequence of the printing plant, of the distribution network for newspapers using trucks and newsstands, and the famous newspaper delivery boy. That newspaper bundle was based on the distribution technology of a time and place.`\n>\n> `When the distribution technology changed with the internet, there was going to be the great unwind, and then the great rebundle, in the form of Google and Facebook and Twitter.”`\n\nThis is certainly true: we could only put [live events on Twitch](https://youtu.be/TCPjk8Tpb5c?t=1025) after network infrastructure made it cheap enough to broadcast live video around the world.\n\nBut it’s no coincidence that physical businesses are unbundling at the same time as digital ones, despite relying on different technologies, and often very little tech at all. Neither technology nor innovations built upon it come from magic: what consumers *actually want* plays a key role; today it’s driven by the niche market vibe shift.\n\nWhy? Well first, consumer demand fosters technological innovation. I took a cursory glance at solar panels [last month](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/podcast-discussion-negotiating-our?s=w#:\\~:text=we%E2%80%99re%20already%20on%20the%20way.%20solar%2C%20wind%2C%20fusion%2C%20geothermal%2C%20and%20hydrogen%20energy%20technologies%20have%20all%20advanced%20significantly%20even%20in%20the%20past%20decade.), where growing consumer demand and growing production have *induced* new technologies; if people hadn’t bothered to use streaming services in the early days, there wouldn’t have been the investment that made them possible at scale. Substack was built because its founders [believed](https://every.to/divinations/substack-s-ideology) writers wanted to offer readers deeper value in a specific niche - and that [readers would pay for it](https://twitter.com/hamishmckenzie/status/1532432557513404416) – not due to any new technologies, just due to the niche market vibe shift.\n\nSecond, even when this technological innovation happens, there is no rule commanding consumers to use every new use case that’s suddenly made possible. Google, Facebook, and Twitter all had to create new bundles that people actually wanted to use: do [Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B), [Google Answers](http://answers.google.com/answers/faq.html#:\\~:text=google%20answers%20was%20an%20experimental%20product%20for%20users%20to%20get%20help%20from%20researchers%20with%20expertise%20in%20online%20searching.), or [Google Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Notebook#:\\~:text=allowed%20users%20to%20save%20and%20organize%20clips%20of%20information%20while%20conducting%20research%20online) ring a bell?\n\n**I think the reason I’m seeing more sweetshops around is because of a niche market vibe shift. The technology for serving more niche communities has always existed, but now consumers actually want it. *But what does this mean?***\n\n\n---\n\nI have two quick points before we move on: why this insight is important and why this shift is happening.\n\nFirst, understanding that bundling and unbundling cycles sway partly due to social preferences, as well as technology, is important to understanding where these sways stop and start, and how to take advantage of them. If it’s true that people want more meaningful, participatory communities, that tells us a lot more about where the future is going than simply observing the entire possibility space opened up by new technologies. When I looked at those failed Google products, I got the impression that Google - founded by Stanford grads - originally sought to be a lot more academic than it is today, with tools for professional research and note-taking. We can understand that these products failed because they weren’t aligned with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, even though they were technically feasible.\n\nSecond, my quick take is that this shift has its roots in society’s search for reciprocal connection. The 21st century is probably the only century that will ever be worth calling ‘the internet century’ (by the 22nd the internet won’t be exciting anymore). Today’s internet is very uni-directional, with big influencers megaphoning to their followers[4](#footnote-4). But people also want to [belong ](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/about#:\\~:text=the%20sense%20of%20belonging%20that%20humans%20inherently%20desire)to something, and as I wrote a few months ago, building connections *[within](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/leading-movements-communicating-change?s=w#:\\~:text=so%20build%20connections-,within,-your%20movement)* your community makes it so much more fulfilling. You feel you’re really participating, and this is really why I go to the sweet shop. Society just invented the internet, and is searching for meaning. Also [G](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/great-recession-still-with-us/547268/).[F](https://www.bruegel.org/2018/10/ten-years-after-the-crisis-the-wests-failure-pushing-china-towards-state-capitalism/).[C](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227439075_THE_IMPACT_OF_THE_ECONOMIC_CRISIS_ON_CULTURE).\n\n![This is a great time to take a break, maybe stretch your legs, and share with a friend! (Kevin Huynh)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7pYdkgZ_QQytonD6G7z0-.webp?height=796&width=1456)\n\n\n---\n\nAnd now we’re back; great.\n\nThe rest of this essay is to explore how this shift is influencing culture. We can think pretty big about *all* the unbundling opportunities new technologies bring: in *[Life After Google](https://www.waterstones.com/book/life-after-google/george-gilder/9781621575764)*, Gilder points out that even money *could* be unbundled, though I don’t think this is on the cards. It’s possible, but consumers don’t actually want to unbundle money into a store of value, unit of account, and so forth. Very few communities are built simply around money as a tool; everyone will *not* become [currency traders](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/12/11/bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-web3-great-protocol-politics/#:\\~:text=everyone%20becomes%20a%20foreign-exchange%20trader); a niche can’t be built around something that everyone uses, and most people don’t care.\n\nI want to instead focus on culture, which people care a lot about, and is interesting for many further reasons. It interests me how great cultural contributions both capture some image of society whilst also moving it forward[5](#footnote-5). Culture is also beautifully adaptable and flexible and fluid, changing rapidly and exhibiting immense diversity of contribution and consumption: it’s a *collection of niches*. I expect this vibe shift to play out in culture very soon. (It goes without saying that this will occur on the internet.)\n\nThat idea of culture as a collection of niches deserves interrogating: culture is also something that we all share. And sure, there will continue to be big Instagram accounts and large supermarkets; shows and books that everyone talks about and events that unite the masses. But as Rex Woodbury notes: “[Celebrities like (Tom) Cruise are a dying breed](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/cultural-transmission-in-the-internet?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NTcwOTkyMTIsIl8iOiJlcTFDOSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDE2NzYxMywiZXhwIjoxNjU0MTcxMjEzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzg1MDAiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.pfK8o_nxyz7FIehX7-CkXaRKa-d0-3YhcJ1I1r_YRkg&s=r#:\\~:text=celebrities%20like%20cruise%20are%20a%20dying%20breed)”[6](#footnote-6). The 2020s will be defined by the “[long tail of creators](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/the-two-way-mirror-of-art-and-technology?s=w#:\\~:text=embolden%20the%20long%20tail%20of%20creators)”, each creating en mass for far smaller communities with much deeper engagement. In the 21st century, we will seek experiences that feel, in some important ways (and not all), totally and emphatically human — that’s why people love [eSports](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-watch-other-people-play-video?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDUxMzUyMzksIl8iOiJrK0hyQSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDIwNjQ5OSwiZXhwIjoxNjU0MjEwMDk5LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzMyOTk2Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.T5f6CkyK7SFpzLO3nZZ6U2Zudqkkf4npc9ZsqDnSqFg&s=r#:\\~:text=as%20totally%20and%20unabashedly%20human); we’re in the moment *with* the players. **For the hobbies and niches that we love, for which we’re far more than mere followers, we’ll find people serving that niche with dedicated communities built around them.**\n\n[Late Checkout](https://latecheckout.studio/about) is an agency that doesn’t deserve the negative tag associated with such companies[7](#footnote-7); they capture the situation perfectly:\n\n> “The old way of building products was to try and be everything to everyone. Products were chunky, bloated, and didn’t serve the individual or communities.”\n>\n> “People want to feel a connection to the products they use. They want the internet to feel human and alive again.”\n\nIt’s exciting to see people building the future, and culturally we’re going to see exactly this: **content will be built around niche and dedicated communities with genuine human connection**[8](#footnote-8).\n\n\n---\n\n## And thus the 1,000 True Fans thesis eventually manifests.\n\nIn 2008, Kevin Kelly wrote one of the most seminal contributions in culture tech. The founding editor-in-chief of Wired wrote that, in the internet age:\n\n> `“To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans.”`\n\nA thousand dedicated fans who love your niche. Sound familiar? \n\nSo what took so long?\n\nIt’s certainly the case that the technology of the era made this difficult. Kelly hoped that the internet would be the ultimate matchmaker. Bring the creators and the consumers online, and they will find each other. To an extent, they did, especially in the early days of the internet: in 2008, writing about 1000 True Fans looked sensible. But it was still pretty hard: you could publish your own content, but without mass-market services like Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube, that helped you discover, it was tough to find or be found.\n\nThe introduction of these services, monoliths to be, helped in one sense: it was a lot easier for people to find you on the internet. But the price for this matchmaking was almost everything: Facebook and Instagram take almost 100% of all the revenue creators see on their platforms; YouTube takes 45%; Spotify paid an average of merely £700 to each artist last year[9](#footnote-9). These monoliths do the matching, but make it virtually unaffordable to create in the first place.\n\nIt was a vibe shift, not a technological one, that struck the first blow to this impoverished paradigm. Twitch, Kickstarter, Patreon, Substack, amongst many others, are all services built for creators to cater for the dedicated fans of their niche; all built amidst the community-centric vibe shift born in the 2010s. Well before the 2020 crypto bull run, a16z heralded a [100 True Fans model](https://future.a16z.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/) in 2020[10](#footnote-10), arguing that this was made possible with even more niche services from Podia, Teachable, and Kajabi. (These companies *all* help people sell educational courses, which undermines the argument to an extent, but you only need 250 fans paying £20/$25 per month to earn \\~3x the average UK salary or [$75,000](https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html#:\\~:text=no%20matter%20how%20much%20more), so you get the picture.) **With the alignment of technology and the vibe, the impoverished paradigm of community-stricken creatorship is collapsing.**\n\n\n---\n\n### Blockchain is a game-changer for this dynamic\n\n*You’re reading on Mirror, so you probably know all this; you could easily skip to the next phrase in bold.*\n\nIn the early 2020s, new technologies like blockchain, distributed ledgers, and cryptocurrencies really came in vogue. A distributed ledger is triple-entry bookkeeping. [Double-entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping) bookkeeping was invented in medieval Italy: two parties to a transaction would both record it, giving you more data about your business and more verifiable figures, making it easier to trade and pursue enterprise.\n\nEight centuries later, distributed ledgers are triple-entry bookkeeping: as well as the seller and buyer, *every participant in the economy* makes a record of the transaction, and every participant is using the same, enormous, book. Blockchain is the technology of how you add to this book and run software with it, and cryptocurrency is one use case: the ledger essentially records how much currency you own, which everyone verifies. Obviously I’m simplifying, but I’ll refer to these technologies as ‘web3 techs’[11](#footnote-11).\n\nThe significance of blockchain becomes clear upon interrogating why Facebook, YouTube, *et al.* can take such high take rates on creators. One side is [discovery](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does#:\\~:text=no%20one%20finds%20a%20person%20on%20patreon%3B%20you%20go%20there%20after%20you%E2%80%99ve%20found%20them): you rarely *find* creators on Patreon. This happens, still, on big social networks. Everyone is on these platforms (well, not Facebook) and when you consume on these platforms frequently, they’re experts in figuring out what content you’ll click on next; big data, [Markov chains](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-markov-chains-50da3645a50d#:\\~:text=predict%20weather%20for%20days%20to%20come%2C%20based%20on%20what%20the%20current%20weather%20state%20is%20at%20the%20time), etc. There are some problems with this, mainly that you get served addictive content rather than niches that you want to engage deeply in, but generally they do this job pretty well, and web3 techs don’t hugely change this.\n\nBut there are a lot of platforms for discovery — this isn’t the competitive moat it once was. People use Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Pinterest, and much more, in addition to the discovery platforms we’ve called out above; as mentioned, most people have moved beyond Facebook. Creators could just move to whichever discovery network takes the smallest cut of their revenue. Apart from one thing: they can’t. Everything you’ve ever uploaded to Spotify and all the followers you’ve earnt on Insta: the discovery platform manages this, and you can’t take your community with you. So it’s impossible to leave without starting all over again. And hence discovery networks [squeeze](https://stratechery.com/2015/niches-problem-subscription-services/) creators for revenue.\n\nAnd hence, the game-changer. Because just like with your cryptocurrency, you can store your [writing](https://mirror.xyz/), your [music](https://sound.xyz/), your [art](https://opensea.io/), your [videos](https://d.tube/), your [followers](https://lens.xyz/), on a distributed ledger, or “on chain”. As [LBRY](https://lbry.io/) puts it: “LBRY does to publishing what Bitcoin did to money.” Just like with your currency, everyone participating in the economy agrees that “yes, [Leo](https://app.ens.domains/name/leosn.eth/details), you wrote this blog”. Sites like Spotify and Instagram don’t manage your songs and your followers because these songs and follower relationships are stored on chain, and Spotify is reduced to one of many organisations competing to merely display this content in the best way, and help you discover new content as well. Creators are not beholden to any of them – and neither are consumers[12](#footnote-12).\n\nSo now the community economy is fully on the way because finally, **dedicated participants in a niche community can meaningfully support their creators**. When people are deeply engaged in something they care about, even the original consumers become contributors, and we’ll start to see vibrant ecosystems formed around niches and creators. Greg Isenberg explores the [Loot ecosystem](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/heres-what-the-future-of-nfts-looks?s=r#:\\~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20an%20ecosystem%20not%20just%20an%20nft), an NFT project upon which creators have realised myriad different ideas; [Jenkins the Valet](https://www.jenkinsthevalet.com/how-it-works) is a great example of community-led storytelling, which will become a category-defining cultural genre in the 2020s, on par with ‘art’ and ‘literature’. [Jadyn Violet](https://twitter.com/jadynviolet), a musician, told me that “I’ve never got this much interaction on my art before.” He's been spending his time building new ideas to engage his community, spending time speaking with his fans, and making more music — this is what his fans love him for.\n\nBusiness people often talk about the Minimum Viable Product your business needs before you start selling. The MVP isn’t dead, but all businesses (not just creators) will soon require a [Minimum Viable Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uPRruLfZoU&t=2s) to make a mark in their market[13](#footnote-13).\n\nWhat will underlie all of these communities are tokens of membership, probably tiered, which tie a community together. They’ll be non-fungible, which means they’ll be unique and personalisable, thus allowing for deeper engagement. **Consumers get dedicated community and deeper value in a niche they care about; creators are finally rewarded fairly for their work.** \n\n![Tiered NFT collections can help creators build more intimate communities.

Google was only just getting started, but after aligning with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, became the favoured search engine of billions.\n\nJoe Kraus, the founder of Excite, [explains why](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=i%20went%20to%20revisit%20joe%20kraus): Excite had been a 20th century company, targeting revenue from the top ten American companies, as media businesses had been doing for decades. Meanwhile, Google focused on attracting advertisers — and millions of them. Why did this work? *“The 20th century was about dozens of markets of millions of consumers. **The 21st century is about millions of markets of dozens of consumers.**”*\n\n*Hopefully you didn’t realise you just read 3,000 words; I’d love it if you were to [subscribe](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/subscribe) or mint one of 5 editions.*\n\n[1](#footnote-anchor-1) I don’t have the percentage figures for the change in sweetshops and clothing stores, I’m sorry.\n\n[2](#footnote-anchor-2) Other blogging platforms are available, but they’re still *built* for writers: [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), whilst I’m testing the beta of [Nuance](http://nuance.xyz/).\n\n[3](#footnote-anchor-3) Stratechery anticipated this for (cable) TV in [2013](https://stratechery.com/2013/the-jobs-tv-does/#:\\~:text=the%20jobs%20tv%20has%20traditionally%20done%20include) and watched it happen in [2017](https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/#:\\~:text=tv%20is%20broken%20up%20into%20the%20different%20%E2%80%9Cjobs%E2%80%9D%20it%20has%20traditionally%20done): TV used to keep us **informed**, **educate** us, show **live events**, tell **stories**, and provide **escapism**. But now we get our information from Google; our education from YouTube, Coursera, or Masterworks; our live events from Twitch; our story-telling from Netflix; and our escapism from social media. It’s not as neat as this of course: in reality, everything just exploded into a plethora of mainly mobile options; but unbundling is happening.\n\n[4](#footnote-anchor-4) I number crunched some of the Instagram follower stats [here](https://mention.com/en/reports/instagram/followers/) and would estimate that of all the follower-followee relationships, the largest 1% of accounts receive about 50% of all following relationships.\n\n[5](#footnote-anchor-5) I’m undecided and unclear on what this means for ‘great’ or ‘classic’ cultural contributions. If a great cultural contribution captures an image of society, but also moves it on, how can it be classic, if being classic is continuing to capture that image of society: hasn’t society moved on and been influenced by your contribution? \n\n[6](#footnote-anchor-6) Woodbury is mainly making the argument that it is specifically “a 20th-century culture centered around white leading men” that is dying, but whilst it’s true that celebrities are becoming more diverse, what’s more important is that they’re becoming less relevant. The social media era is dying; the social community era is coming.\n\n[7](#footnote-anchor-7) It’s ironic that in principle ‘agency’ is the most important thing in the world, whilst ‘agencies’ that help brands and creators reach their fans are typically seen as vultures.\n\n[8](#footnote-anchor-8) I also expect niche and tailored content that is ***emphatically artificial***: a further implication of this, from the unrelated and sufficient cause of AI too, is that individuals will asymptote towards consuming cultural content that is tailored just for them: *an audience of one*. As artificial intelligence (which was also covered [last month](http://The asymptote we reach is that for most people, most of the time, their reading and viewing material is created just for them)) gets more able to accurately predict our interests and preferences at a subtle scale, we get to a world in which content is designed – no, generated – to appeal specifically to us. GPT-3 is an OpenAI algorithm that can conduct incredibly lifelike conversation (at times). [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/news/openai-punished-dev-used-gpt-3-to-resurrect-dead-ethics) covers the story of one developer who used the algorithm to sell bots that spoke with the *individual personalities* of an individual chosen by a customer, including dead relatives. As always, there are challenges that accompany change, as well as opportunities; AI will continue to develop, but the risk and threat of AI trained to stimulate and manipulate us need to be managed. *Further reading: [The Diff](https://www.thediff.co/p/what-happens-when-most-media-is-produced?s=r) explores this idea from a more financial perspective; the [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/27/1088140809/fake-linkedin-profiles) illustrates a perfect example, with fake LinkedIn profiles generated explicitly to pique your interest; [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/04/when-your-bot-is-better-than-you.html) touches on the issue from the other perspective, that of the person using the bot.*\n\n[9](#footnote-anchor-9) Sources: Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube stats [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/); in 2021 Spotify paid [$7bn](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) to [8 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) creators, which is $875 or £700 (slightly higher than the claim in the a16z source above).\n\n[10](#footnote-anchor-10) Take the price of Bitcoin as a proxy for ‘web3 in vogue’ for a moment. When a16z published the 100 True Fans articles in February 2020, Bitcoin was worth under <$10k, and wouldn’t get above that price until October. The niche market vibe shift predates the cultural significance of web3 and crypto.\n\n[11](#footnote-anchor-11) I’m simplifying a lot; this isn’t a technical introduction to web3. Most obviously, it’s not the case that each person has to manually agree everything in a distributed ledger. Rather, it’s every computer server; and it’s not every computer server, it’s those who proactively commit to contributing to manage the ledger and communicating with it.

[Bitcoin miners hit the headlines](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/01/bitcoin-miners-are-selling-off-their-btc-holdings-to-cope-with-market-headwinds/) after selling off, the [Optimism airdrop](https://thedefiant.io/op-airdrop-claim-guide/) went live, the [Terra saga ](https://thedefiant.io/luna-coin-surge-terra-roundup/)continued to make the news, and Solana NFTs sit atop the volume rankings [despite the shutdown ](https://decrypt.co/101834/bug-brings-down-solana-blockchain-for-four-hours)this week.\n\nAfter all that, it’s time to have a little fun and relax with The Friday Buzz!\n\n## [ZooDAO ($ZOO)](https://zoodao.com/) — [Pacifico](https://discoverpacifico.com/) & [Double-Strength Margarita Mix](https://cuervo.com/)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*mlKm6QPf2y6gIW4T)\n\nFeeling a little more burned-out than usual this week? This might be just the combo to loosen things up, although it may also be a little crazy.\n\nZooDAO ($ZOO) is a project I’ve been following personally for a long time now. It’s still in the early development stages, but the vision of the project is exciting and the team is well-supported. I believe it COULD be one of the NFT projects ready to take-off when the bull market returns, but don’t get me wrong here, this is a high-risk, long-term hold with no guarantees.\n\nSome may say that my love of a Pacifico mixed with double-strength margarita mix is just another sign I drink too much, but hell, it hits the spot during the summer down here in Texas. It’s even better for putting the week of work behind me because it doesn’t take much before I’m feeling the Friday buzz… and only a couple more before I’m plain drunk… and only a couple more before I wake up thinking “What the hell happened? I gotta stop drinking that sh\\*t.”\n\n## [Propy ($PRO)](https://propy.com/browse/) — [Slow & Low Rock & Rye](https://www.drinkslowandlow.com/products/rock-and-rye)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*rRsCgFKl4iRgv8dC)\n\nA good friend of mine introduced me to “Slow & Low” many years ago, and I’ve kept some around ever since. When I go to a bar that serves a great Old Fashioned, I always go back. However, it’s so tough to make a good one from home that, before I knew about this stuff, I rarely got the chance to enjoy this DELICIOUS drink. Now, it’s one of my go-to favorites, especially on a Friday.\n\nI think Propy is the perfect token to go along with Hochstadter’s Rock & Rye this week. I started following the project a few weeks ago as I continue to dive deep into the intersection of crypto and real estate. It’s been around for a while and already boasts some pretty amazing accomplishments. When we look back ten years from now, my bet is that Propy will be one of the major contributors connecting the “old fashioned” real estate market to the decentralized world of blockchain.\n\n## [THORWallet ($TGT)](https://www.thorwallet.org/) — [Carlsberg Elephant](https://www.carlsberg.com/en/our-beer/elephant-strong/)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*vimFK80\\_ofXV5k4g)\n\nIf you’re looking for something with a strong kick, a little $TGT and Carlsberg Elephant is the way to go.

The THORWallet DEX is a promising project within the THORChain ecosystem, and I think it gives you the opportunity for some stronger exposure/higher potential gains due to the token’s low market cap at just $2.3M according to CoinGecko.\n\nAs always, higher upside potential comes with higher risk, and we’re going pretty hard on the gambling this week. Then again, this is crypto, and we’ve gotta have some fun every once in a while right?\n\nJust pay attention to risks, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and try to learn something along the way.\n\nHave a great weekend and… Always Drink (and Trade) Responsibly!\n", "timestamp": 1654284716, "digest": "QtMw0VMv71HvExGvpa2zhKPghJ5ICh58T--9b36fxYg", "contributor": "0x488CB7D6F7596ACcf0544913Aa9e0d0f38F315F4"}

This process operates at every level of life — the goals just shift based on local context and conditions.\n\nAt the human level, each of us pursue our own goals and sense-make for ourselves. We individually construct an interpretation of our experience according to our own central nervous system and consciousness.\n\nIt’s only in relation to other human beings that we have to contend with the goals of other individuals. And it’s there where shared or competing goals are determined.\n\nSocially, we’re aided by shared languaging (the totality of our intercommunications) and the emergent culture surrounding us, which further scaffolds, frames, and constrains our individual experience of sense-making.\n\nOur personal realities are relative, subject to the localized information available to one’s consciousness in each moment.

{"id": "6B5yrikm6A3OzDu0_ehcjQNAmqfEXVD27imnzBCZL2c", "title": "How does Frax Finance Works?", "body": "## What is FRAX?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gzsf4rZ9_j_qzQ7WhRiAw.jpeg?height=721&width=1281)\n\nFrax is a decentralized fractional stablecoin. This means, it’s partially collateralized with on-chain crypto (USDC) and the other bit is backed by an algorithm.\n\nThe stablecoins market is very well established. How does Frax add a flavor to it? Let’s understand stablecoins first.\n\nThe goal of any stablecoin is simple— maintain its peg to 1 USD. However, things get fiercely complex to achieve this simple goal.\n\nNumerous methods like fiat collateralization, commodity backing, crypto collateralization, and complex computer algorithms have been used in the past. Here are some live results:\n\nDAI is over collateralized.\n\nUSDT is fiat-backed but centralized. *[USDT has been frozen](https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-blacklists-39-ethereum-addresses-worth-over-46-million)* in the past.\n\nUST was completely algorithm-backed. However, the faith has been lost in stablecoins with its *[recent spiral death](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahulrai/2022/05/17/the-death-spiral-how-terras-algorithmic-stablecoin-came-crashing-down/#:\\~:text=This%20selling%20pressure%20on%20UST,inflationary%20loop%20in%20LUNA's%20supply)*.\n\nOn the contrary, FRAX is neither a hundred percent Fiat nor algorithm backed, only collateralized by the given fraction called collateralization ratio.\n\nThis collateralization ratio is however not decided by the Frax protocol. The collateral can go in any direction in long run. It only adjusts to keep the peg of FRAX to $1.\n\n## Minting & Stability of FRAX\n\n### Minting\n\nThe *[FRAX minting process](https://docs.frax.finance/minting-and-redeeming)* is kept simple. To mint one FRAX (worth $1) a collateral amount (only USDC) along with Frax governance token (FXS) within the parameters of the pre-determined collateral ratio is locked in Frax Finance treasury.\n\nFor instance, if the collateral ratio is 85 percent, 0.85 percent of USDC with 0.15 percent of FXS can be locked in Frax Protocol to mint one FRAX. The same can be redeemed, if the FRAX is returned to its protocol, the user is given back the locked assets (USDC and FXS).\n\n### Stability\n\nSay the price of Frax breaks its peg either way up or down. The stability can be restored. The process is fairly incentivized for users to even care about it\n\nFor instance, if the Frax trades above a dollar, Arbitrageurs can deposit USDC and FXS only worth a dollar in the required collateral ratio, to mint one FRAX token. This token then can be traded in the open market and the user can bag the difference.\n\nFor the other way around, if Frax trades below a dollar, arbitrageurs can buy from the open market at less than a dollar, and then redeem it to bag the USDC & FXS in a collateralized ratio worth one dollar.\n\nHowever, the collateral ratio is entitled to change according to market demands. Say, you deposited 80 USDC and 20 dollars’ worth of FXS to mint 100 FRAX. Upon redemption, you may receive deposited assets in different ratio as it is subject to change.\n\n## FXS– The Governance Token & Value accrual\n\nAt the genesis of FXS tokenomics, the supply was capped at a total of 100 million.\n\nWith every FRAX mint, the collateralized FXS is burnt. This creates a limited supply of its governance token. As the usage of Frax ups, the supply of FXS is reduced, creating more value for its governance token and to its holders.\n\nHey, the holders can pool FXS in liquidity pairs like FXS/FRAX, and FXS/ETH on Uniswap to earn a small cut for gas collected on every swap.\n\nWith more veFXS comes more Voting powers. It follows a similar voting escrow model that is popular amongst other DeFi protocols.\n\nUsers can lock up their FXS in return for veFXS for up to 4 years, the higher the locking period the maximum rewards, yeah, yeah, you get it. The reward for veFXS seems promising:\n\n* Governance rights\n* Special boost rewards\n* AMOs profits\n\n*[Frax AMOs](https://app.frax.finance/amos)* are programmatically designed to move the collateral USDC to other DeFi ecosystems to efficiently enhance the profits without actually breaking the FRAX peg to $1. The profits are then used to rebuy Frax and burn it, or directly lend profits to veFXS holders.\n\nIn any other case if the collateralization ratio is increased, requiring more USDC collateral. The AMO reverses and deposits the USDC back until FRAX restores confidence.\n\nFrax has implemented several important AMOs, each AMO works hard (lol, computer programs) to bring maximum profits to the Frax treasury.\n\n* FRAX 1559\n* Collateral investor\n* Curve AMO\n* Uniswap V3\n* Frax lending\n\nThe majority of profits are brought in by the collateral investor AMO which is about $70 million, while other AMOs also have a fair share in accruing the profits.\n\n## veFXS Upgrade: Frax, Convex, and Curve wars\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe story of reaps & rewards goes further with their *[partnership with Convex](https://convexfinance.medium.com/december-update-protocol-expansion-cvx-eth-incentive-migration-2c9327b48259#0a3b)*. From here on things are a bit complex, if, in simpler terms, it’s more money for veFXS holders. Before we head on to how this partnership benefits FRAX and its holders, let’s understand Convex Protocol first.\n\nDecrypting in 3… 2… 1… Go!\n\nSoon after its launch,\\* \\*Convex Protocol gained traction in the DeFi space. Here’s why— Simplicity and more rewards. The user couldn’t ask for more— unless it’s even more money.\n\nConvex simplifies now what is known as the Curve wars on its user's behalf.\n\nIt soon began accruing CRV and veCRV, and by the first half of 2021, it became the largest holder of veCRV.\n\nThis is where Curve Wars gets intéressant. With more veCRV comes more Voting powers. Wait, but how’s voting power gonna help— unless it’s about money.\n\nEvery 10 days, the curve emissions are decided by the veCRV holders— the voters.

Specifically, these Victorian-themed tuckshops and sweet connoisseurs, plucked from two hundred years prior and plopped in the middle of a high street that doesn’t quite know how to welcome its new tenant. One of the sweet shops near me plasters ‘Toys, Trains, Treats” on dated storefront panelling; it’s the shop you thought your grandparents went to when they were young, except the steam trains on sale are battery powered.\n\nThis wasn’t just a Baader–Meinhof [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion), where upon seeing something once you perceive it everywhere. During the first year of the pandemic, an extra [73](https://www.mylondon.news/news/uk-world-news/i-visited-londons-new-dangerous-22961908#:\\~:text=73%20more%20sweet%20shops%20in%20the%20uk%20compared%20with%202020) sweetshops popped up in the UK, net, according to the Local Data Company. That’s not a huge number, but it’s pretty significant given the broader lockdown context; the total number of clothing shops fell by 1,236 in the same period[1](#footnote-1). The shop near me was set up in September ‘21. It begs the question: what’s so special about sweet shops?\n\nI had spent my Saturday morning at Waterstones buying some books, at the sweet shop questioning the shop assistant, and now I’m writing about it on Substack. In days gone by, I would have bought my physical items at Sainsbury’s and, in comparison to today, where I have my Substack and my main [website](https://www.leonasskau.co.uk/), all my digital publishing would be through the same technology stack, probably Wordpress.\n\nSweets are nice, but the real difference is the existence of a shop that will focus all of its resources on their specific niche product. I bought some weird caramel chocolate flakes that defy description, but they were excellent. I certainly paid a premium, but next time I want sweets, I’ll go there again, because *they know their product*; I just bought what the shop assistant recommended. At Waterstone’s, I picked up [Train Dreams](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/13/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review) because I told the manager I was after contemporary fiction; I use Substack because it’s built for writers[2](#footnote-2). **What makes these businesses special is that they serve *niche markets in which they can give people much deeper value.***\n\n![I mean, you get what I’m saying, despite the weird animojis, right? (HelloDorking)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xRINH9-26W7ZvCggFpXtm.jpeg?height=2438&width=3024)\n\n## Unbundling into niches\n\nBundling and unbundling are [not new concepts](https://hbr.org/1999/03/unbundling-the-corporation). It’s a pretty simple convection model: you start with a business, over time you add more products, services, and features, and then you get bloated, do everything ‘kinda well’, until a niche competitor comes along and does *one* of your services *really really well*, and bit by bit you get pieced apart. The [complexity convection](https://every.to/divinations/complexity-convection-765851) is a pattern that cannot be unseen. \n\nPeople have observed this happening to our contemporary digital landscape for about a decade, beginning in practice much earlier. Craigslist was [unbundled](https://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/345941486/the-spawn-of-craigslist-like-most-vcs-that-focus) into many things, including Reddit, which is now being [unbundled](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit?s=r) into many more things, like Nextdoor. In the language of [a16z](https://a16z.com/2019/09/11/platforms-verticals-unbundling/), the famed tech investors: platforms get unbundled into verticals, which turn into platforms, at which point the cycle resumes, and all of a sudden I’ve turned into a strategy writer[3](#footnote-3). \n\nI’m not the first to herald this unbundling in the physical world either. Peter Day [wrote](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=Economy%2C%20%20almost%20a,speed%20and%20efficiency.) an excellent essay predicting “the heartbeat economy, almost a concierge approach to customers,” in 2013:\n\n> `“This would be a worryingly intimate relationship for many businesses, but one which might provide a new kind of rewarding marketplace if they dared to be far closer to their customers' individuality.”`\n\nHe wrote about it in the BBC, but today he would write on his own blog.\n\nMy real contribution is to note that this challenges why unbundling and bundling happens at all. The main idea behind why we sway between bundled and unbundled products is the [underlying technology](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling#:\\~:text=a%20lot%20of%20it%20is%20based%20on%20the%20underlying%20technology%20change). Marc Andreesen, co-founder of a16z and of [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)), the first web browser, talks through the concept of the newspaper:\n\n> `“The newspaper bundle, the idea of this slug of news and sports scores and classifieds and stock quotes that arrives once a day was a consequence of the printing plant, of the distribution network for newspapers using trucks and newsstands, and the famous newspaper delivery boy. That newspaper bundle was based on the distribution technology of a time and place.`\n>\n> `When the distribution technology changed with the internet, there was going to be the great unwind, and then the great rebundle, in the form of Google and Facebook and Twitter.”`\n\nThis is certainly true: we could only put [live events on Twitch](https://youtu.be/TCPjk8Tpb5c?t=1025) after network infrastructure made it cheap enough to broadcast live video around the world.\n\nBut it’s no coincidence that physical businesses are unbundling at the same time as digital ones, despite relying on different technologies, and often very little tech at all. Neither technology nor innovations built upon it come from magic: what consumers *actually want* plays a key role; today it’s driven by the niche market vibe shift.\n\nWhy? Well first, consumer demand fosters technological innovation. I took a cursory glance at solar panels [last month](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/podcast-discussion-negotiating-our?s=w#:\\~:text=we%E2%80%99re%20already%20on%20the%20way.%20solar%2C%20wind%2C%20fusion%2C%20geothermal%2C%20and%20hydrogen%20energy%20technologies%20have%20all%20advanced%20significantly%20even%20in%20the%20past%20decade.), where growing consumer demand and growing production have *induced* new technologies; if people hadn’t bothered to use streaming services in the early days, there wouldn’t have been the investment that made them possible at scale. Substack was built because its founders [believed](https://every.to/divinations/substack-s-ideology) writers wanted to offer readers deeper value in a specific niche - and that [readers would pay for it](https://twitter.com/hamishmckenzie/status/1532432557513404416) – not due to any new technologies, just due to the niche market vibe shift.\n\nSecond, even when this technological innovation happens, there is no rule commanding consumers to use every new use case that’s suddenly made possible. Google, Facebook, and Twitter all had to create new bundles that people actually wanted to use: do [Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B), [Google Answers](http://answers.google.com/answers/faq.html#:\\~:text=google%20answers%20was%20an%20experimental%20product%20for%20users%20to%20get%20help%20from%20researchers%20with%20expertise%20in%20online%20searching.), or [Google Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Notebook#:\\~:text=allowed%20users%20to%20save%20and%20organize%20clips%20of%20information%20while%20conducting%20research%20online) ring a bell?\n\n**I think the reason I’m seeing more sweetshops around is because of a niche market vibe shift. The technology for serving more niche communities has always existed, but now consumers actually want it. *But what does this mean?***\n\n\n---\n\nI have two quick points before we move on: why this insight is important and why this shift is happening.\n\nFirst, understanding that bundling and unbundling cycles sway partly due to social preferences, as well as technology, is important to understanding where these sways stop and start, and how to take advantage of them. If it’s true that people want more meaningful, participatory communities, that tells us a lot more about where the future is going than simply observing the entire possibility space opened up by new technologies. When I looked at those failed Google products, I got the impression that Google - founded by Stanford grads - originally sought to be a lot more academic than it is today, with tools for professional research and note-taking. We can understand that these products failed because they weren’t aligned with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, even though they were technically feasible.\n\nSecond, my quick take is that this shift has its roots in society’s search for reciprocal connection. The 21st century is probably the only century that will ever be worth calling ‘the internet century’ (by the 22nd the internet won’t be exciting anymore). Today’s internet is very uni-directional, with big influencers megaphoning to their followers[4](#footnote-4). But people also want to [belong ](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/about#:\\~:text=the%20sense%20of%20belonging%20that%20humans%20inherently%20desire)to something, and as I wrote a few months ago, building connections *[within](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/leading-movements-communicating-change?s=w#:\\~:text=so%20build%20connections-,within,-your%20movement)* your community makes it so much more fulfilling. You feel you’re really participating, and this is really why I go to the sweet shop. Society just invented the internet, and is searching for meaning. Also [G](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/great-recession-still-with-us/547268/).[F](https://www.bruegel.org/2018/10/ten-years-after-the-crisis-the-wests-failure-pushing-china-towards-state-capitalism/).[C](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227439075_THE_IMPACT_OF_THE_ECONOMIC_CRISIS_ON_CULTURE).\n\n![This is a great time to take a break, maybe stretch your legs, and share with a friend! (Kevin Huynh)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7pYdkgZ_QQytonD6G7z0-.webp?height=796&width=1456)\n\n\n---\n\nThe rest of this essay is to explore how this shift is influencing culture. We can think pretty big about *all* the unbundling opportunities new technologies bring: in *[Life After Google](https://www.waterstones.com/book/life-after-google/george-gilder/9781621575764)*, Gilder points out that even money *could* be unbundled, though I don’t think this is on the cards. It’s possible, but consumers don’t actually want to unbundle money into a store of value, unit of account, and so forth. Very few communities are built simply around money as a tool; everyone will *not* become [currency traders](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/12/11/bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-web3-great-protocol-politics/#:\\~:text=everyone%20becomes%20a%20foreign-exchange%20trader); a niche can’t be built around something that everyone uses, and most people don’t care.\n\nI want to instead focus on culture, which people care a lot about, and is interesting for many further reasons. It interests me how great cultural contributions both capture some image of society whilst also moving it forward[5](#footnote-5). Culture is also beautifully adaptable and flexible and fluid, changing rapidly and exhibiting immense diversity of contribution and consumption: it’s a *collection of niches*. I expect this vibe shift to play out in culture very soon. (It goes without saying that this will occur on the internet.)\n\nThat idea of culture as a collection of niches deserves interrogating: culture is also something that we all share. And sure, there will continue to be big Instagram accounts and large supermarkets; shows and books that everyone talks about and events that unite the masses. But as Rex Woodbury notes: “[Celebrities like (Tom) Cruise are a dying breed](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/cultural-transmission-in-the-internet?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NTcwOTkyMTIsIl8iOiJlcTFDOSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDE2NzYxMywiZXhwIjoxNjU0MTcxMjEzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzg1MDAiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.pfK8o_nxyz7FIehX7-CkXaRKa-d0-3YhcJ1I1r_YRkg&s=r#:\\~:text=celebrities%20like%20cruise%20are%20a%20dying%20breed)”[6](#footnote-6). The 2020s will be defined by the “[long tail of creators](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/the-two-way-mirror-of-art-and-technology?s=w#:\\~:text=embolden%20the%20long%20tail%20of%20creators)”, each creating en mass for far smaller communities with much deeper engagement. In the 21st century, we will seek experiences that feel, in some important ways (and not all), totally and emphatically human — that’s why people love [eSports](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-watch-other-people-play-video?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDUxMzUyMzksIl8iOiJrK0hyQSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDIwNjQ5OSwiZXhwIjoxNjU0MjEwMDk5LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzMyOTk2Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.T5f6CkyK7SFpzLO3nZZ6U2Zudqkkf4npc9ZsqDnSqFg&s=r#:\\~:text=as%20totally%20and%20unabashedly%20human); we’re in the moment *with* the players. **For the hobbies and niches that we love, for which we’re far more than mere followers, we’ll find people serving that niche with dedicated communities built around them.**\n\n[Late Checkout](https://latecheckout.studio/about) is an agency that doesn’t deserve the negative tag associated with such companies[7](#footnote-7); they capture the situation perfectly:\n\n> `“The old way of building products was to try and be everything to everyone. Products were chunky, bloated, and didn’t serve the individual or communities.”`\n>\n> `“People want to feel a connection to the products they use. They want the internet to feel human and alive again.”`\n\nIt’s exciting to see people building the future, and culturally we’re going to see exactly this: **content will be built around niche and dedicated communities with genuine human connection**[8](#footnote-8).\n\n\n---\n\n## And thus the 1,000 True Fans thesis eventually manifests.\n\nIn 2008, Kevin Kelly wrote one of the most seminal contributions in culture tech. The founding editor-in-chief of Wired wrote that, in the internet age:\n\n> `“To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans.”`\n\nA thousand dedicated fans who love your niche. Sound familiar? \n\nSo what took so long?\n\nIt’s certainly the case that the technology of the era made this difficult. Kelly hoped that the internet would be the ultimate matchmaker. Bring the creators and the consumers online, and they will find each other. To an extent, they did, especially in the early days of the internet: in 2008, writing about 1000 True Fans looked sensible. But it was still pretty hard: you could publish your own content, but without mass-market services like Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube, that helped you discover, it was tough to find or be found.\n\nThe introduction of these services, monoliths to be, helped in one sense: it was a lot easier for people to find you on the internet. But the price for this matchmaking was almost everything: Facebook and Instagram take almost 100% of all the revenue creators see on their platforms; YouTube takes 45%; Spotify paid an average of merely £700 to each artist last year[9](#footnote-9). These monoliths do the matching, but make it virtually unaffordable to create in the first place.\n\nIt was a vibe shift, not a technological one, that struck the first blow to this impoverished paradigm. Twitch, Kickstarter, Patreon, Substack, amongst many others, are all services built for creators to cater for the dedicated fans of their niche; all built amidst the community-centric vibe shift born in the 2010s. Well before the 2020 crypto bull run, a16z heralded a [100 True Fans model](https://future.a16z.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/) in 2020[10](#footnote-10), arguing that this was made possible with even more niche services from Podia, Teachable, and Kajabi. (These companies *all* help people sell educational courses, which undermines the argument to an extent, but you only need 250 fans paying £20/$25 per month to earn \\~3x the average UK salary or [$75,000](https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html#:\\~:text=no%20matter%20how%20much%20more), so you get the picture.) **With the alignment of technology and the vibe, the impoverished paradigm of community-stricken creatorship is collapsing.**\n\n\n---\n\n### Blockchain is a game-changer for this dynamic\n\n*You’re reading on Mirror, so you probably know all this; you could easily skip to the next phrase in bold.*\n\nIn the early 2020s, new technologies like blockchain, distributed ledgers, and cryptocurrencies really came in vogue. A distributed ledger is triple-entry bookkeeping. [Double-entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping) bookkeeping was invented in medieval Italy: two parties to a transaction would both record it, giving you more data about your business and more verifiable figures, making it easier to trade and pursue enterprise.\n\nEight centuries later, distributed ledgers are triple-entry bookkeeping: as well as the seller and buyer, *every participant in the economy* makes a record of the transaction, and every participant is using the same, enormous, book. Blockchain is the technology of how you add to this book and run software with it, and cryptocurrency is one use case: the ledger essentially records how much currency you own, which everyone verifies. Obviously I’m simplifying, but I’ll refer to these technologies as ‘web3 techs’[11](#footnote-11).\n\nThe significance of blockchain becomes clear upon interrogating why Facebook, YouTube, *et al.* can take such high take rates on creators. One side is [discovery](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does#:\\~:text=no%20one%20finds%20a%20person%20on%20patreon%3B%20you%20go%20there%20after%20you%E2%80%99ve%20found%20them): you rarely *find* creators on Patreon. This happens, still, on big social networks. Everyone is on these platforms (well, not Facebook) and when you consume on these platforms frequently, they’re experts in figuring out what content you’ll click on next; big data, [Markov chains](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-markov-chains-50da3645a50d#:\\~:text=predict%20weather%20for%20days%20to%20come%2C%20based%20on%20what%20the%20current%20weather%20state%20is%20at%20the%20time), etc. There are some problems with this, mainly that you get served addictive content rather than niches that you want to engage deeply in, but generally they do this job pretty well, and web3 techs don’t hugely change this.\n\nBut there are a lot of platforms for discovery — this isn’t the competitive moat it once was. People use Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Pinterest, and much more, in addition to the discovery platforms we’ve called out above; as mentioned, most people have moved beyond Facebook. Creators could just move to whichever discovery network takes the smallest cut of their revenue. Apart from one thing: they can’t. Everything you’ve ever uploaded to Spotify and all the followers you’ve earnt on Insta: the discovery platform manages this, and you can’t take your community with you. So it’s impossible to leave without starting all over again. And hence discovery networks [squeeze](https://stratechery.com/2015/niches-problem-subscription-services/) creators for revenue.\n\nAnd hence, the game-changer. Because just like with your cryptocurrency, you can store your [writing](https://mirror.xyz/), your [music](https://sound.xyz/), your [art](https://opensea.io/), your [videos](https://d.tube/), your [followers](https://lens.xyz/), on a distributed ledger, or “on chain”. As [LBRY](https://lbry.io/) puts it: “LBRY does to publishing what Bitcoin did to money.” Just like with your currency, everyone participating in the economy agrees that “yes, [Leo](https://app.ens.domains/name/leosn.eth/details), you wrote this blog”. Sites like Spotify and Instagram don’t manage your songs and your followers because these songs and follower relationships are stored on chain, and Spotify is reduced to one of many organisations competing to merely display this content in the best way, and help you discover new content as well. Creators are not beholden to any of them – and neither are consumers[12](#footnote-12).\n\nSo now the community economy is fully on the way because finally, **dedicated participants in a niche community can meaningfully support their creators**. When people are deeply engaged in something they care about, even the original consumers become contributors, and we’ll start to see vibrant ecosystems formed around niches and creators. Greg Isenberg explores the [Loot ecosystem](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/heres-what-the-future-of-nfts-looks?s=r#:\\~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20an%20ecosystem%20not%20just%20an%20nft), an NFT project upon which creators have realised myriad different ideas; [Jenkins the Valet](https://www.jenkinsthevalet.com/how-it-works) is a great example of community-led storytelling, which will become a category-defining cultural genre in the 2020s, on par with ‘art’ and ‘literature’. [Jadyn Violet](https://twitter.com/jadynviolet), a musician, told me that “I’ve never got this much interaction on my art before.” He's been spending his time building new ideas to engage his community, spending time speaking with his fans, and making more music — this is what his fans love him for.\n\nBusiness people often talk about the Minimum Viable Product your business needs before you start selling. The MVP isn’t dead, but all businesses (not just creators) will soon require a [Minimum Viable Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uPRruLfZoU&t=2s) to make a mark in their market[13](#footnote-13).\n\nWhat will underlie all of these communities are tokens of membership, probably tiered, which tie a community together. They’ll be non-fungible, which means they’ll be unique and personalisable, thus allowing for deeper engagement. **Consumers get dedicated community and deeper value in a niche they care about; creators are finally rewarded fairly for their work.** \n\n![Tiered NFT collections can help creators build more intimate communities. Everyone wants this; web3 makes it possible.

Google was only just getting started, but after aligning with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, became the favoured search engine of billions.\n\nJoe Kraus, the founder of Excite, [explains why](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=i%20went%20to%20revisit%20joe%20kraus): Excite had been a 20th century company, targeting revenue from the top ten American companies, as media businesses had been doing for decades. Meanwhile, Google focused on attracting advertisers — and millions of them. Why did this work? *“The 20th century was about dozens of markets of millions of consumers. **The 21st century is about millions of markets of dozens of consumers.**”*\n\n\n---\n\n*Hopefully that didn’t actually feel like 3,000 words; I’d love it if you were to [subscribe](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/subscribe) or mint one of 5 editions.*\n\n\n---\n\n`Image credits: HelloDorking; Kevin Huynh; Peter Yang`\n\n***Footnotes:***\n\n[1](#footnote-anchor-1) I don’t have the percentage figures for the change in sweetshops and clothing stores, I’m sorry.\n\n[2](#footnote-anchor-2) Other blogging platforms are available, including this one, but they’re still *built* for writers; I’m testing the beta of [Nuance](http://nuance.xyz/).\n\n[3](#footnote-anchor-3) Stratechery anticipated this for (cable) TV in [2013](https://stratechery.com/2013/the-jobs-tv-does/#:\\~:text=the%20jobs%20tv%20has%20traditionally%20done%20include) and watched it happen in [2017](https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/#:\\~:text=tv%20is%20broken%20up%20into%20the%20different%20%E2%80%9Cjobs%E2%80%9D%20it%20has%20traditionally%20done): TV used to keep us **informed**, **educate** us, show **live events**, tell **stories**, and provide **escapism**. But now we get our information from Google; our education from YouTube, Coursera, or Masterworks; our live events from Twitch; our story-telling from Netflix; and our escapism from social media. It’s not as neat as this of course: in reality, everything just exploded into a plethora of mainly mobile options; but unbundling is happening.\n\n[4](#footnote-anchor-4) I number crunched some of the Instagram follower stats [here](https://mention.com/en/reports/instagram/followers/) and would estimate that of all the follower-followee relationships, the largest 1% of accounts receive about 50% of all following relationships.\n\n[5](#footnote-anchor-5) I’m undecided and unclear on what this means for ‘great’ or ‘classic’ cultural contributions. If a great cultural contribution captures an image of society, but also moves it on, how can it be classic, if being classic is continuing to capture that image of society: hasn’t society moved on and been influenced by your contribution? \n\n[6](#footnote-anchor-6) Woodbury is mainly making the argument that it is specifically “a 20th-century culture centered around white leading men” that is dying, but whilst it’s true that celebrities are becoming more diverse, what’s more important is that they’re becoming less relevant. The social media era is dying; the social community era is coming.\n\n[7](#footnote-anchor-7) It’s ironic that in principle ‘agency’ is the most important thing in the world, whilst ‘agencies’ that help brands and creators reach their fans are typically seen as vultures.\n\n[8](#footnote-anchor-8) I also expect niche and tailored content that is ***emphatically artificial***: a further implication of this, from the unrelated and sufficient cause of AI too, is that individuals will asymptote towards consuming cultural content that is tailored just for them: *an audience of one*. As artificial intelligence (which was also covered [last month](http://The asymptote we reach is that for most people, most of the time, their reading and viewing material is created just for them)) gets more able to accurately predict our interests and preferences at a subtle scale, we get to a world in which content is designed – no, generated – to appeal specifically to us. GPT-3 is an OpenAI algorithm that can conduct incredibly lifelike conversation (at times). [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/news/openai-punished-dev-used-gpt-3-to-resurrect-dead-ethics) covers the story of one developer who used the algorithm to sell bots that spoke with the *individual personalities* of an individual chosen by a customer, including dead relatives. As always, there are challenges that accompany change, as well as opportunities; AI will continue to develop, but the risk and threat of AI trained to stimulate and manipulate us need to be managed. *Further reading: [The Diff](https://www.thediff.co/p/what-happens-when-most-media-is-produced?s=r) explores this idea from a more financial perspective; the [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/27/1088140809/fake-linkedin-profiles) illustrates a perfect example, with fake LinkedIn profiles generated explicitly to pique your interest; [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/04/when-your-bot-is-better-than-you.html) touches on the issue from the other perspective, that of the person using the bot.*\n\n[9](#footnote-anchor-9) Sources: Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube stats [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/); in 2021 Spotify paid [$7bn](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) to [8 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) creators, which is $875 or £700 (slightly higher than the claim in the a16z source above).\n\n[10](#footnote-anchor-10) Take the price of Bitcoin as a proxy for ‘web3 in vogue’ for a moment. When a16z published the 100 True Fans articles in February 2020, Bitcoin was worth under <$10k, and wouldn’t get above that price until October. The niche market vibe shift predates the cultural significance of web3 and crypto.\n\n[11](#footnote-anchor-11) I’m simplifying a lot; this isn’t a technical introduction to web3. Most obviously, it’s not the case that each person has to manually agree everything in a distributed ledger. Rather, it’s every computer server; and it’s not every computer server, it’s those who proactively commit to contributing to manage the ledger and communicating with it.

Specifically, these Victorian-themed tuckshops and sweet connoisseurs, plucked from two hundred years prior and plopped in the middle of a high street that doesn’t quite know how to welcome its new tenant. One of the sweet shops near me plasters ‘Toys, Trains, Treats” on dated storefront panelling; it’s the shop you thought your grandparents went to when they were young, except the steam trains on sale are battery powered.\n\nThis wasn’t just a Baader–Meinhof [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion), where upon seeing something once you perceive it everywhere. During the first year of the pandemic, an extra [73](https://www.mylondon.news/news/uk-world-news/i-visited-londons-new-dangerous-22961908#:\\~:text=73%20more%20sweet%20shops%20in%20the%20uk%20compared%20with%202020) sweetshops popped up in the UK, net, according to the Local Data Company. That’s not a huge number, but it’s pretty significant given the broader lockdown context; the total number of clothing shops fell by 1,236 in the same period[1](#footnote-1). The shop near me was set up in September ‘21. It begs the question: what’s so special about sweet shops?\n\nI had spent my Saturday morning at Waterstones buying some books, at the sweet shop questioning the shop assistant, and now I’m writing about it on Substack. In days gone by, I would have bought my physical items at Sainsbury’s and, in comparison to today, where I have my Substack and my main [website](https://www.leonasskau.co.uk/), all my digital publishing would be through the same technology stack, probably Wordpress.\n\nSweets are nice, but the real difference is the existence of a shop that will focus all of its resources on their specific niche product. I bought some weird caramel chocolate flakes that defy description, but they were excellent. I certainly paid a premium, but next time I want sweets, I’ll go there again, because *they know their product*; I just bought what the shop assistant recommended. At Waterstone’s, I picked up [Train Dreams](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/13/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review) because I told the manager I was after contemporary fiction; I use Substack because it’s built for writers[2](#footnote-2). **What makes these businesses special is that they serve *niche markets in which they can give people much deeper value.***\n\n![I mean, you get what I’m saying, despite the weird animojis, right? (HelloDorking)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xRINH9-26W7ZvCggFpXtm.jpeg?height=2438&width=3024)\n\n## Unbundling into niches\n\nBundling and unbundling are [not new concepts](https://hbr.org/1999/03/unbundling-the-corporation). It’s a pretty simple convection model: you start with a business, over time you add more products, services, and features, and then you get bloated, do everything ‘kinda well’, until a niche competitor comes along and does *one* of your services *really really well*, and bit by bit you get pieced apart. The [complexity convection](https://every.to/divinations/complexity-convection-765851) is a pattern that cannot be unseen. \n\nPeople have observed this happening to our contemporary digital landscape for about a decade, beginning in practice much earlier. Craigslist was [unbundled](https://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/345941486/the-spawn-of-craigslist-like-most-vcs-that-focus) into many things, including Reddit, which is now being [unbundled](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit?s=r) into many more things, like Nextdoor. In the language of [a16z](https://a16z.com/2019/09/11/platforms-verticals-unbundling/), the famed tech investors: platforms get unbundled into verticals, which turn into platforms, at which point the cycle resumes, and all of a sudden I’ve turned into a strategy writer[3](#footnote-3). \n\nI’m not the first to herald this unbundling in the physical world either. Peter Day [wrote](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=Economy%2C%20%20almost%20a,speed%20and%20efficiency.) an excellent essay predicting “the heartbeat economy, almost a concierge approach to customers,” in 2013:\n\n> `“This would be a worryingly intimate relationship for many businesses, but one which might provide a new kind of rewarding marketplace if they dared to be far closer to their customers' individuality.”`\n\nHe wrote about it in the BBC, but today he would write on his own blog.\n\nMy real contribution is to note that this challenges why unbundling and bundling happens at all. The main idea behind why we sway between bundled and unbundled products is the [underlying technology](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling#:\\~:text=a%20lot%20of%20it%20is%20based%20on%20the%20underlying%20technology%20change). Marc Andreesen, co-founder of a16z and of [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)), the first web browser, talks through the concept of the newspaper:\n\n> `“The newspaper bundle, the idea of this slug of news and sports scores and classifieds and stock quotes that arrives once a day was a consequence of the printing plant, of the distribution network for newspapers using trucks and newsstands, and the famous newspaper delivery boy. That newspaper bundle was based on the distribution technology of a time and place.`\n>\n> `When the distribution technology changed with the internet, there was going to be the great unwind, and then the great rebundle, in the form of Google and Facebook and Twitter.”`\n\nThis is certainly true: we could only put [live events on Twitch](https://youtu.be/TCPjk8Tpb5c?t=1025) after network infrastructure made it cheap enough to broadcast live video around the world.\n\nBut it’s no coincidence that physical businesses are unbundling at the same time as digital ones, despite relying on different technologies, and often very little tech at all. Neither technology nor innovations built upon it come from magic: what consumers *actually want* plays a key role; today it’s driven by the niche market vibe shift.\n\nWhy? Well first, consumer demand fosters technological innovation. I took a cursory glance at solar panels [last month](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/podcast-discussion-negotiating-our?s=w#:\\~:text=we%E2%80%99re%20already%20on%20the%20way.%20solar%2C%20wind%2C%20fusion%2C%20geothermal%2C%20and%20hydrogen%20energy%20technologies%20have%20all%20advanced%20significantly%20even%20in%20the%20past%20decade.), where growing consumer demand and growing production have *induced* new technologies; if people hadn’t bothered to use streaming services in the early days, there wouldn’t have been the investment that made them possible at scale. Substack was built because its founders [believed](https://every.to/divinations/substack-s-ideology) writers wanted to offer readers deeper value in a specific niche - and that [readers would pay for it](https://twitter.com/hamishmckenzie/status/1532432557513404416) – not due to any new technologies, just due to the niche market vibe shift.\n\nSecond, even when this technological innovation happens, there is no rule commanding consumers to use every new use case that’s suddenly made possible. Google, Facebook, and Twitter all had to create new bundles that people actually wanted to use: do [Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B), [Google Answers](http://answers.google.com/answers/faq.html#:\\~:text=google%20answers%20was%20an%20experimental%20product%20for%20users%20to%20get%20help%20from%20researchers%20with%20expertise%20in%20online%20searching.), or [Google Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Notebook#:\\~:text=allowed%20users%20to%20save%20and%20organize%20clips%20of%20information%20while%20conducting%20research%20online) ring a bell?\n\n**I think the reason I’m seeing more sweetshops around is because of a niche market vibe shift. The technology for serving more niche communities has always existed, but now consumers actually want it. *But what does this mean?***\n\n\n---\n\nI have two quick points before we move on: why this insight is important and why this shift is happening.\n\nFirst, understanding that bundling and unbundling cycles sway partly due to social preferences, as well as technology, is important to understanding where these sways stop and start, and how to take advantage of them. If it’s true that people want more meaningful, participatory communities, that tells us a lot more about where the future is going than simply observing the entire possibility space opened up by new technologies. When I looked at those failed Google products, I got the impression that Google - founded by Stanford grads - originally sought to be a lot more academic than it is today, with tools for professional research and note-taking. We can understand that these products failed because they weren’t aligned with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, even though they were technically feasible.\n\nSecond, my quick take is that this shift has its roots in society’s search for reciprocal connection. The 21st century is probably the only century that will ever be worth calling ‘the internet century’ (by the 22nd the internet won’t be exciting anymore). Today’s internet is very uni-directional, with big influencers megaphoning to their followers[4](#footnote-4). But people also want to [belong ](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/about#:\\~:text=the%20sense%20of%20belonging%20that%20humans%20inherently%20desire)to something, and as I wrote a few months ago, building connections *[within](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/leading-movements-communicating-change?s=w#:\\~:text=so%20build%20connections-,within,-your%20movement)* your community makes it so much more fulfilling. You feel you’re really participating, and this is really why I go to the sweet shop. Society just invented the internet, and is searching for meaning.

(Kevin Huynh)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7pYdkgZ_QQytonD6G7z0-.webp?height=796&width=1456)\n\n\n---\n\nThe rest of this essay is to explore how this shift is influencing culture. We can think pretty big about *all* the unbundling opportunities new technologies bring: in *[Life After Google](https://www.waterstones.com/book/life-after-google/george-gilder/9781621575764)*, Gilder points out that even money *could* be unbundled, though I don’t think this is on the cards. It’s possible, but consumers don’t actually want to unbundle money into a store of value, unit of account, and so forth. Very few communities are built simply around money as a tool; everyone will *not* become [currency traders](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/12/11/bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-web3-great-protocol-politics/#:\\~:text=everyone%20becomes%20a%20foreign-exchange%20trader); a niche can’t be built around something that everyone uses, and most people don’t care.\n\nI want to instead focus on culture, which people care a lot about, and is interesting for many further reasons. It interests me how great cultural contributions both capture some image of society whilst also moving it forward[5](#footnote-5). Culture is also beautifully adaptable and flexible and fluid, changing rapidly and exhibiting immense diversity of contribution and consumption: it’s a *collection of niches*. I expect this vibe shift to play out in culture very soon. (It goes without saying that this will occur on the internet.)\n\nThat idea of culture as a collection of niches deserves interrogating: culture is also something that we all share. And sure, there will continue to be big Instagram accounts and large supermarkets; shows and books that everyone talks about and events that unite the masses. But as Rex Woodbury notes: “[Celebrities like (Tom) Cruise are a dying breed](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/cultural-transmission-in-the-internet?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NTcwOTkyMTIsIl8iOiJlcTFDOSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDE2NzYxMywiZXhwIjoxNjU0MTcxMjEzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzg1MDAiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.pfK8o_nxyz7FIehX7-CkXaRKa-d0-3YhcJ1I1r_YRkg&s=r#:\\~:text=celebrities%20like%20cruise%20are%20a%20dying%20breed)”[6](#footnote-6). The 2020s will be defined by the “[long tail of creators](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/the-two-way-mirror-of-art-and-technology?s=w#:\\~:text=embolden%20the%20long%20tail%20of%20creators)”, each creating en mass for far smaller communities with much deeper engagement. In the 21st century, we will seek experiences that feel, in some important ways (and not all), totally and emphatically human — that’s why people love [eSports](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-watch-other-people-play-video?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDUxMzUyMzksIl8iOiJrK0hyQSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDIwNjQ5OSwiZXhwIjoxNjU0MjEwMDk5LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzMyOTk2Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.T5f6CkyK7SFpzLO3nZZ6U2Zudqkkf4npc9ZsqDnSqFg&s=r#:\\~:text=as%20totally%20and%20unabashedly%20human); we’re in the moment *with* the players. **For the hobbies and niches that we love, for which we’re far more than mere followers, we’ll find people serving that niche with dedicated communities built around them.**\n\n[Late Checkout](https://latecheckout.studio/about) is an agency that doesn’t deserve the negative tag associated with such companies[7](#footnote-7); they capture the situation perfectly:\n\n> `“The old way of building products was to try and be everything to everyone. Products were chunky, bloated, and didn’t serve the individual or communities.”`\n>\n> `“People want to feel a connection to the products they use. They want the internet to feel human and alive again.”`\n\nIt’s exciting to see people building the future, and culturally we’re going to see exactly this: **content will be built around niche and dedicated communities with genuine human connection**[8](#footnote-8).\n\n\n---\n\n## And thus the 1,000 True Fans thesis eventually manifests.\n\nIn 2008, Kevin Kelly wrote one of the most seminal contributions in culture tech. The founding editor-in-chief of Wired wrote that, in the internet age:\n\n> `“To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans.”`\n\nA thousand dedicated fans who love your niche. Sound familiar? \n\nSo what took so long?\n\nIt’s certainly the case that the technology of the era made this difficult. Kelly hoped that the internet would be the ultimate matchmaker. Bring the creators and the consumers online, and they will find each other. To an extent, they did, especially in the early days of the internet: in 2008, writing about 1000 True Fans looked sensible. But it was still pretty hard: you could publish your own content, but without mass-market services like Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube, that helped you discover, it was tough to find or be found.\n\nThe introduction of these services, monoliths to be, helped in one sense: it was a lot easier for people to find you on the internet. But the price for this matchmaking was almost everything: Facebook and Instagram take almost 100% of all the revenue creators see on their platforms; YouTube takes 45%; Spotify paid an average of merely £700 to each artist last year[9](#footnote-9). These monoliths do the matching, but make it virtually unaffordable to create in the first place.\n\nIt was a vibe shift, not a technological one, that struck the first blow to this impoverished paradigm. Twitch, Kickstarter, Patreon, Substack, amongst many others, are all services built for creators to cater for the dedicated fans of their niche; all built amidst the community-centric vibe shift born in the 2010s. Well before the 2020 crypto bull run, a16z heralded a [100 True Fans model](https://future.a16z.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/) in 2020[10](#footnote-10), arguing that this was made possible with even more niche services from Podia, Teachable, and Kajabi. (These companies *all* help people sell educational courses, which undermines the argument to an extent, but you only need 250 fans paying £20/$25 per month to earn \\~3x the average UK salary or [$75,000](https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html#:\\~:text=no%20matter%20how%20much%20more), so you get the picture.) **With the alignment of technology and the vibe, the impoverished paradigm of community-stricken creatorship is collapsing.**\n\n\n---\n\n### Blockchain is a game-changer for this dynamic\n\n*You’re reading on Mirror, so you probably know all this; you could easily skip to the next phrase in bold.*\n\nIn the early 2020s, new technologies like blockchain, distributed ledgers, and cryptocurrencies really came in vogue. A distributed ledger is triple-entry bookkeeping. [Double-entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping) bookkeeping was invented in medieval Italy: two parties to a transaction would both record it, giving you more data about your business and more verifiable figures, making it easier to trade and pursue enterprise.\n\nEight centuries later, distributed ledgers are triple-entry bookkeeping: as well as the seller and buyer, *every participant in the economy* makes a record of the transaction, and every participant is using the same, enormous, book. Blockchain is the technology of how you add to this book and run software with it, and cryptocurrency is one use case: the ledger essentially records how much currency you own, which everyone verifies. Obviously I’m simplifying, but I’ll refer to these technologies as ‘web3 techs’[11](#footnote-11).\n\nThe significance of blockchain becomes clear upon interrogating why Facebook, YouTube, *et al.* can take such high take rates on creators. One side is [discovery](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does#:\\~:text=no%20one%20finds%20a%20person%20on%20patreon%3B%20you%20go%20there%20after%20you%E2%80%99ve%20found%20them): you rarely *find* creators on Patreon. This happens, still, on big social networks. Everyone is on these platforms (well, not Facebook) and when you consume on these platforms frequently, they’re experts in figuring out what content you’ll click on next; big data, [Markov chains](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-markov-chains-50da3645a50d#:\\~:text=predict%20weather%20for%20days%20to%20come%2C%20based%20on%20what%20the%20current%20weather%20state%20is%20at%20the%20time), etc. There are some problems with this, mainly that you get served addictive content rather than niches that you want to engage deeply in, but generally they do this job pretty well, and web3 techs don’t hugely change this.\n\nBut there are a lot of platforms for discovery — this isn’t the competitive moat it once was. People use Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Pinterest, and much more, in addition to the discovery platforms we’ve called out above; as mentioned, most people have moved beyond Facebook. Creators could just move to whichever discovery network takes the smallest cut of their revenue. Apart from one thing: they can’t. Everything you’ve ever uploaded to Spotify and all the followers you’ve earnt on Insta: the discovery platform manages this, and you can’t take your community with you. So it’s impossible to leave without starting all over again. And hence discovery networks [squeeze](https://stratechery.com/2015/niches-problem-subscription-services/) creators for revenue.\n\nAnd hence, the game-changer. Because just like with your cryptocurrency, you can store your [writing](https://mirror.xyz/), your [music](https://sound.xyz/), your [art](https://opensea.io/), your [videos](https://d.tube/), your [followers](https://lens.xyz/), on a distributed ledger, or “on chain”. As [LBRY](https://lbry.io/) puts it: “LBRY does to publishing what Bitcoin did to money.” Just like with your currency, everyone participating in the economy agrees that “yes, [Leo](https://app.ens.domains/name/leosn.eth/details), you wrote this blog”. Sites like Spotify and Instagram don’t manage your songs and your followers because these songs and follower relationships are stored on chain, and Spotify is reduced to one of many organisations competing to merely display this content in the best way, and help you discover new content as well. Creators are not beholden to any of them – and neither are consumers[12](#footnote-12).\n\nSo now the community economy is fully on the way because finally, **dedicated participants in a niche community can meaningfully support their creators**. When people are deeply engaged in something they care about, even the original consumers become contributors, and we’ll start to see vibrant ecosystems formed around niches and creators. Greg Isenberg explores the [Loot ecosystem](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/heres-what-the-future-of-nfts-looks?s=r#:\\~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20an%20ecosystem%20not%20just%20an%20nft), an NFT project upon which creators have realised myriad different ideas; [Jenkins the Valet](https://www.jenkinsthevalet.com/how-it-works) is a great example of community-led storytelling, which will become a category-defining cultural genre in the 2020s, on par with ‘art’ and ‘literature’. [Jadyn Violet](https://twitter.com/jadynviolet), a musician, told me that “I’ve never got this much interaction on my art before.” He's been spending his time building new ideas to engage his community, spending time speaking with his fans, and making more music — this is what his fans love him for.\n\nBusiness people often talk about the Minimum Viable Product your business needs before you start selling. The MVP isn’t dead, but all businesses (not just creators) will soon require a [Minimum Viable Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uPRruLfZoU&t=2s) to make a mark in their market[13](#footnote-13).\n\nWhat will underlie all of these communities are tokens of membership, probably tiered, which tie a community together. They’ll be non-fungible, which means they’ll be unique and personalisable, thus allowing for deeper engagement. **Consumers get dedicated community and deeper value in a niche they care about; creators are finally rewarded fairly for their work.** \n\n![Tiered NFT collections can help creators build more intimate communities. Everyone wants this; web3 makes it possible.

Google was only just getting started, but after aligning with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, became the favoured search engine of billions.\n\nJoe Kraus, the founder of Excite, [explains why](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=i%20went%20to%20revisit%20joe%20kraus): Excite had been a 20th century company, targeting revenue from the top ten American companies, as media businesses had been doing for decades. Meanwhile, Google focused on attracting advertisers — and millions of them. Why did this work? *“The 20th century was about dozens of markets of millions of consumers. **The 21st century is about millions of markets of dozens of consumers.**”*\n\n\n---\n\n*Hopefully that didn’t actually feel like 3,000 words; I’d love it if you were to [subscribe](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/subscribe) for free or mint one of 5 editions.*\n\n\n---\n\n`Image credits: HelloDorking; Kevin Huynh; Peter Yang`\n\n***Footnotes:***\n\n[1](#footnote-anchor-1) I don’t have the percentage figures for the change in sweetshops and clothing stores, I’m sorry.\n\n[2](#footnote-anchor-2) Other blogging platforms are available, including this one, but they’re still *built* for writers; I’m testing the beta of [Nuance](http://nuance.xyz/).\n\n[3](#footnote-anchor-3) Stratechery anticipated this for (cable) TV in [2013](https://stratechery.com/2013/the-jobs-tv-does/#:\\~:text=the%20jobs%20tv%20has%20traditionally%20done%20include) and watched it happen in [2017](https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/#:\\~:text=tv%20is%20broken%20up%20into%20the%20different%20%E2%80%9Cjobs%E2%80%9D%20it%20has%20traditionally%20done): TV used to keep us **informed**, **educate** us, show **live events**, tell **stories**, and provide **escapism**. But now we get our information from Google; our education from YouTube, Coursera, or Masterworks; our live events from Twitch; our story-telling from Netflix; and our escapism from social media. It’s not as neat as this of course: in reality, everything just exploded into a plethora of mainly mobile options; but unbundling is happening.\n\n[4](#footnote-anchor-4) I number crunched some of the Instagram follower stats [here](https://mention.com/en/reports/instagram/followers/) and would estimate that of all the follower-followee relationships, the largest 1% of accounts receive about 50% of all following relationships.\n\n[5](#footnote-anchor-5) I’m undecided and unclear on what this means for ‘great’ or ‘classic’ cultural contributions. If a great cultural contribution captures an image of society, but also moves it on, how can it be classic, if being classic is continuing to capture that image of society: hasn’t society moved on and been influenced by your contribution? \n\n[6](#footnote-anchor-6) Woodbury is mainly making the argument that it is specifically “a 20th-century culture centered around white leading men” that is dying, but whilst it’s true that celebrities are becoming more diverse, what’s more important is that they’re becoming less relevant. The social media era is dying; the social community era is coming.\n\n[7](#footnote-anchor-7) It’s ironic that in principle ‘agency’ is the most important thing in the world, whilst ‘agencies’ that help brands and creators reach their fans are typically seen as vultures.\n\n[8](#footnote-anchor-8) I also expect niche and tailored content that is ***emphatically artificial***: a further implication of this, from the unrelated and sufficient cause of AI too, is that individuals will asymptote towards consuming cultural content that is tailored just for them: *an audience of one*. As artificial intelligence (which was also covered [last month](http://The asymptote we reach is that for most people, most of the time, their reading and viewing material is created just for them)) gets more able to accurately predict our interests and preferences at a subtle scale, we get to a world in which content is designed – no, generated – to appeal specifically to us. GPT-3 is an OpenAI algorithm that can conduct incredibly lifelike conversation (at times). [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/news/openai-punished-dev-used-gpt-3-to-resurrect-dead-ethics) covers the story of one developer who used the algorithm to sell bots that spoke with the *individual personalities* of an individual chosen by a customer, including dead relatives. As always, there are challenges that accompany change, as well as opportunities; AI will continue to develop, but the risk and threat of AI trained to stimulate and manipulate us need to be managed. *Further reading: [The Diff](https://www.thediff.co/p/what-happens-when-most-media-is-produced?s=r) explores this idea from a more financial perspective; the [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/27/1088140809/fake-linkedin-profiles) illustrates a perfect example, with fake LinkedIn profiles generated explicitly to pique your interest; [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/04/when-your-bot-is-better-than-you.html) touches on the issue from the other perspective, that of the person using the bot.*\n\n[9](#footnote-anchor-9) Sources: Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube stats [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/); in 2021 Spotify paid [$7bn](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) to [8 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) creators, which is $875 or £700 (slightly higher than the claim in the a16z source above).\n\n[10](#footnote-anchor-10) Take the price of Bitcoin as a proxy for ‘web3 in vogue’ for a moment. When a16z published the 100 True Fans articles in February 2020, Bitcoin was worth under <$10k, and wouldn’t get above that price until October. The niche market vibe shift predates the cultural significance of web3 and crypto.\n\n[11](#footnote-anchor-11) I’m simplifying a lot; this isn’t a technical introduction to web3. Most obviously, it’s not the case that each person has to manually agree everything in a distributed ledger. Rather, it’s every computer server; and it’s not every computer server, it’s those who proactively commit to contributing to manage the ledger and communicating with it. A good introductory podcast [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6N7cIUkh0DnADrJpWlzcY3?si=7rj7ns-AQTqwShJvTHRfOQ); a more detailed introduction [here](https://ethereum.org/en/web3/); a more technical and key whitepaper [here](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/); and for more depth I suggest the further reading listed under the whitepaper.\n\n[12](#footnote-anchor-12) This illustrates Vitalik Buterin’s (founder of Ethereum) infamous Uber [quote](https://proxet.com/blog/how-the-blockchain-is-changing-money-and-business/#:\\~:text=%E2%80%9C-,whereas%20,-most%20%20tend%20%20workers): taxi profiles will be stored on chain, and Uber, Lyft, and more will compete to show you the same drivers, giving the drivers much more power and compensation — which they [need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_resource_theory). *(There we go, I actually got a politics link in.)*\n\n[13](#footnote-anchor-13) This idea comes from Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit.

This process operates at every level of life — the goals just shift based on local context and conditions.\n\nAt the human level, each of us pursue our own goals and sense-make for ourselves. We individually construct an interpretation of our experience according to our own central nervous system and consciousness.\n\nIt’s only in relation to other human beings that we have to contend with the goals of other individuals. And it’s there where shared or competing goals are determined.\n\nSocially, we’re aided by shared languaging (the totality of our intercommunications) and the emergent culture surrounding us, which further scaffolds, frames, and constrains our individual experience of sense-making.\n\nOur personal realities are relative, subject to the localized information available to one’s consciousness in each moment. But through languaging and conversation, we explore our intersubjective experiences of the world together.\n\nConversation is used to explore potential solutions to perceived problems. If an intersubjective, shared meaning can be established, a foundation for collaborative sense-making and storytelling can be built upon. Agreement might be found.\n\nHowever, if the “maps of meaning” aren’t agreed upon, the definition of the “problem”, defined as one’s distance from the imagined goal, also can’t be agreed upon and collaborative progress won’t be made.\n\nThe conversation will be deemed unproductive and impractical relative to one’s goal and violence will be inevitable.\n\nWhen each party’s perspective is based on the belief that “facts” exist, independent of observers, it leads to entrenched positions. Reason no longer works.\n\nNew “facts” aren't accepted because the framing of those facts is entangled in the subjective scaffolding of the individual and the emergent cultural context they’re embedded within.\n\nThe other observer is embedded in a different “reality.” The information of their intersubjective experience is only accessible to them and like-minded others.\n\nGood faith conversation between parties with opposing viewpoints remains our only hope for resolution, but no shared agreement should be expected.\n\nThe distance between consciousnesses and their sense-making, the perceived problems to be solved, and the culture that enmeshes these experiences, is too great.\n\nBut we have to keep trying.", "timestamp": 1654285072, "digest": "9S3o9qwoYrN9XQCOGh9asSnY5nfE4-hgTGs-pPVntME", "contributor": "0x16c3676077017b856dFF4514170332abD7dC2729"}

Specifically, these Victorian-themed tuckshops and sweet connoisseurs, plucked from two hundred years prior and plopped in the middle of a high street that doesn’t quite know how to welcome its new tenant. One of the sweet shops near me plasters ‘Toys, Trains, Treats” on dated storefront panelling; it’s the shop you thought your grandparents went to when they were young, except the steam trains on sale are battery powered.\n\nThis wasn’t just a Baader–Meinhof [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion), where upon seeing something once you perceive it everywhere. During the first year of the pandemic, an extra [73](https://www.mylondon.news/news/uk-world-news/i-visited-londons-new-dangerous-22961908#:\\~:text=73%20more%20sweet%20shops%20in%20the%20uk%20compared%20with%202020) sweetshops popped up in the UK, net, according to the Local Data Company. That’s not a huge number, but it’s pretty significant given the broader lockdown context; the total number of clothing shops fell by 1,236 in the same period[1](#footnote-1). The shop near me was set up in September ‘21. It begs the question: what’s so special about sweet shops?\n\nI had spent my Saturday morning at Waterstones buying some books, at the sweet shop questioning the shop assistant, and now I’m writing about it on Substack. In days gone by, I would have bought my physical items at Sainsbury’s and, in comparison to today, where I have my Substack and my main [website](https://www.leonasskau.co.uk/), all my digital publishing would be through the same technology stack, probably Wordpress.\n\nSweets are nice, but the real difference is the existence of a shop that will focus all of its resources on their specific niche product. I bought some weird caramel chocolate flakes that defy description, but they were excellent. I certainly paid a premium, but next time I want sweets, I’ll go there again, because *they know their product*; I just bought what the shop assistant recommended. At Waterstone’s, I picked up [Train Dreams](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/13/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review) because I told the manager I was after contemporary fiction; I use Substack because it’s built for writers[2](#footnote-2). **What makes these businesses special is that they serve *niche markets in which they can give people much deeper value.***\n\n![I mean, you get what I’m saying, despite the weird animojis, right? (HelloDorking)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xRINH9-26W7ZvCggFpXtm.jpeg?height=2438&width=3024)\n\n## Unbundling into niches\n\nBundling and unbundling are [not new concepts](https://hbr.org/1999/03/unbundling-the-corporation). It’s a pretty simple convection model: you start with a business, over time you add more products, services, and features, and then you get bloated, do everything ‘kinda well’, until a niche competitor comes along and does *one* of your services *really really well*, and bit by bit you get pieced apart. The [complexity convection](https://every.to/divinations/complexity-convection-765851) is a pattern that cannot be unseen. \n\nPeople have observed this happening to our contemporary digital landscape for about a decade, beginning in practice much earlier. Craigslist was [unbundled](https://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/345941486/the-spawn-of-craigslist-like-most-vcs-that-focus) into many things, including Reddit, which is now being [unbundled](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit?s=r) into many more things, like Nextdoor. In the language of [a16z](https://a16z.com/2019/09/11/platforms-verticals-unbundling/), the famed tech investors: platforms get unbundled into verticals, which turn into platforms, at which point the cycle resumes, and all of a sudden I’ve turned into a strategy writer[3](#footnote-3). \n\nI’m not the first to herald this unbundling in the physical world either. Peter Day [wrote](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=Economy%2C%20%20almost%20a,speed%20and%20efficiency.) an excellent essay predicting “the heartbeat economy, almost a concierge approach to customers,” in 2013:\n\n> `“This would be a worryingly intimate relationship for many businesses, but one which might provide a new kind of rewarding marketplace if they dared to be far closer to their customers' individuality.”`\n\nHe wrote about it in the BBC, but today he would write on his own blog.\n\nMy real contribution is to note that this challenges why unbundling and bundling happens at all. The main idea behind why we sway between bundled and unbundled products is the [underlying technology](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling#:\\~:text=a%20lot%20of%20it%20is%20based%20on%20the%20underlying%20technology%20change). Marc Andreesen, co-founder of a16z and of [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)), the first web browser, talks through the concept of the newspaper:\n\n> `“The newspaper bundle, the idea of this slug of news and sports scores and classifieds and stock quotes that arrives once a day was a consequence of the printing plant, of the distribution network for newspapers using trucks and newsstands, and the famous newspaper delivery boy. That newspaper bundle was based on the distribution technology of a time and place.`\n>\n> `When the distribution technology changed with the internet, there was going to be the great unwind, and then the great rebundle, in the form of Google and Facebook and Twitter.”`\n\nThis is certainly true: we could only put [live events on Twitch](https://youtu.be/TCPjk8Tpb5c?t=1025) after network infrastructure made it cheap enough to broadcast live video around the world.\n\nBut it’s no coincidence that physical businesses are unbundling at the same time as digital ones, despite relying on different technologies, and often very little tech at all. Neither technology nor innovations built upon it come from magic: what consumers *actually want* plays a key role; today it’s driven by the niche market vibe shift.\n\nWhy? Well first, consumer demand fosters technological innovation. I took a cursory glance at solar panels [last month](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/podcast-discussion-negotiating-our?s=w#:\\~:text=we%E2%80%99re%20already%20on%20the%20way.%20solar%2C%20wind%2C%20fusion%2C%20geothermal%2C%20and%20hydrogen%20energy%20technologies%20have%20all%20advanced%20significantly%20even%20in%20the%20past%20decade.), where growing consumer demand and growing production have *induced* new technologies; if people hadn’t bothered to use streaming services in the early days, there wouldn’t have been the investment that made them possible at scale. Substack was built because its founders [believed](https://every.to/divinations/substack-s-ideology) writers wanted to offer readers deeper value in a specific niche - and that [readers would pay for it](https://twitter.com/hamishmckenzie/status/1532432557513404416) – not due to any new technologies, just due to the niche market vibe shift.\n\nSecond, even when this technological innovation happens, there is no rule commanding consumers to use every new use case that’s suddenly made possible. Google, Facebook, and Twitter all had to create new bundles that people actually wanted to use: do [Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B), [Google Answers](http://answers.google.com/answers/faq.html#:\\~:text=google%20answers%20was%20an%20experimental%20product%20for%20users%20to%20get%20help%20from%20researchers%20with%20expertise%20in%20online%20searching.), or [Google Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Notebook#:\\~:text=allowed%20users%20to%20save%20and%20organize%20clips%20of%20information%20while%20conducting%20research%20online) ring a bell?\n\n**I think the reason I’m seeing more sweetshops around is because of a niche market vibe shift. The technology for serving more niche communities has always existed, but now consumers actually want it. *But what does this mean?***\n\n\n---\n\nI have two quick points before we move on: why this insight is important and why this shift is happening.\n\nFirst, understanding that bundling and unbundling cycles sway partly due to social preferences, as well as technology, is important to understanding where these sways stop and start, and how to take advantage of them. If it’s true that people want more meaningful, participatory communities, that tells us a lot more about where the future is going than simply observing the entire possibility space opened up by new technologies. When I looked at those failed Google products, I got the impression that Google - founded by Stanford grads - originally sought to be a lot more academic than it is today, with tools for professional research and note-taking. We can understand that these products failed because they weren’t aligned with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, even though they were technically feasible.\n\nSecond, my quick take is that this shift has its roots in society’s search for reciprocal connection. The 21st century is probably the only century that will ever be worth calling ‘the internet century’ (by the 22nd the internet won’t be exciting anymore). Today’s internet is very uni-directional, with big influencers megaphoning to their followers[4](#footnote-4). But people also want to [belong ](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/about#:\\~:text=the%20sense%20of%20belonging%20that%20humans%20inherently%20desire)to something, and as I wrote a few months ago, building connections *[within](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/leading-movements-communicating-change?s=w#:\\~:text=so%20build%20connections-,within,-your%20movement)* your community makes it so much more fulfilling. You feel you’re really participating, and this is really why I go to the sweet shop. Society just invented the internet, and is searching for meaning.

(Kevin Huynh)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7pYdkgZ_QQytonD6G7z0-.webp?height=796&width=1456)\n\n\n---\n\nThe rest of this essay is to explore how this shift is influencing culture. We can think pretty big about *all* the unbundling opportunities new technologies bring: in *[Life After Google](https://www.waterstones.com/book/life-after-google/george-gilder/9781621575764)*, Gilder points out that even money *could* be unbundled, though I don’t think this is on the cards. It’s possible, but consumers don’t actually want to unbundle money into a store of value, unit of account, and so forth. Very few communities are built simply around money as a tool; everyone will *not* become [currency traders](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/12/11/bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-web3-great-protocol-politics/#:\\~:text=everyone%20becomes%20a%20foreign-exchange%20trader); a niche can’t be built around something that everyone uses, and most people don’t care.\n\nI want to instead focus on culture, which people care a lot about, and is interesting for many further reasons. It interests me how great cultural contributions both capture some image of society whilst also moving it forward[5](#footnote-5). Culture is also beautifully adaptable and flexible and fluid, changing rapidly and exhibiting immense diversity of contribution and consumption: it’s a *collection of niches*. I expect this vibe shift to play out in culture very soon. (It goes without saying that this will occur on the internet.)\n\nThat idea of culture as a collection of niches deserves interrogating: culture is also something that we all share. And sure, there will continue to be big Instagram accounts and large supermarkets; shows and books that everyone talks about and events that unite the masses. But as Rex Woodbury notes: “[Celebrities like (Tom) Cruise are a dying breed](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/cultural-transmission-in-the-internet?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NTcwOTkyMTIsIl8iOiJlcTFDOSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDE2NzYxMywiZXhwIjoxNjU0MTcxMjEzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzg1MDAiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.pfK8o_nxyz7FIehX7-CkXaRKa-d0-3YhcJ1I1r_YRkg&s=r#:\\~:text=celebrities%20like%20cruise%20are%20a%20dying%20breed)”[6](#footnote-6). The 2020s will be defined by the “[long tail of creators](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/the-two-way-mirror-of-art-and-technology?s=w#:\\~:text=embolden%20the%20long%20tail%20of%20creators)”, each creating en mass for far smaller communities with much deeper engagement. In the 21st century, we will seek experiences that feel, in some important ways (and not all), totally and emphatically human — that’s why people love [eSports](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-watch-other-people-play-video?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDUxMzUyMzksIl8iOiJrK0hyQSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDIwNjQ5OSwiZXhwIjoxNjU0MjEwMDk5LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzMyOTk2Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.T5f6CkyK7SFpzLO3nZZ6U2Zudqkkf4npc9ZsqDnSqFg&s=r#:\\~:text=as%20totally%20and%20unabashedly%20human); we’re in the moment *with* the players. **For the hobbies and niches that we love, for which we’re far more than mere followers, we’ll find people serving that niche with dedicated communities built around them.**\n\n[Late Checkout](https://latecheckout.studio/about) is an agency that doesn’t deserve the negative tag associated with such companies[7](#footnote-7); they capture the situation perfectly:\n\n> `“The old way of building products was to try and be everything to everyone. Products were chunky, bloated, and didn’t serve the individual or communities.”`\n>\n> `“People want to feel a connection to the products they use. They want the internet to feel human and alive again.”`\n\nIt’s exciting to see people building the future, and culturally we’re going to see exactly this: **content will be built around niche and dedicated communities with genuine human connection**[8](#footnote-8).\n\n\n---\n\n## And thus the 1,000 True Fans thesis eventually manifests.\n\nIn 2008, Kevin Kelly wrote one of the most seminal contributions in culture tech. The founding editor-in-chief of Wired wrote that, in the internet age:\n\n> `“To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans.”`\n\nA thousand dedicated fans who love your niche. Sound familiar? \n\nSo what took so long?\n\nIt’s certainly the case that the technology of the era made this difficult. Kelly hoped that the internet would be the ultimate matchmaker. Bring the creators and the consumers online, and they will find each other. To an extent, they did, especially in the early days of the internet: in 2008, writing about 1000 True Fans looked sensible. But it was still pretty hard: you could publish your own content, but without mass-market services like Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube, that helped you discover, it was tough to find or be found.\n\nThe introduction of these services, monoliths to be, helped in one sense: it was a lot easier for people to find you on the internet. But the price for this matchmaking was almost everything: Facebook and Instagram take almost 100% of all the revenue creators see on their platforms; YouTube takes 45%; Spotify paid an average of merely £700 to each artist last year[9](#footnote-9). These monoliths do the matching, but make it virtually unaffordable to create in the first place.\n\nIt was a vibe shift, not a technological one, that struck the first blow to this impoverished paradigm. Twitch, Kickstarter, Patreon, Substack, amongst many others, are all services built for creators to cater for the dedicated fans of their niche; all built amidst the community-centric vibe shift born in the 2010s. Well before the 2020 crypto bull run, a16z heralded a [100 True Fans model](https://future.a16z.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/) in 2020[10](#footnote-10), arguing that this was made possible with even more niche services from Podia, Teachable, and Kajabi. (These companies *all* help people sell educational courses, which undermines the argument to an extent, but you only need 250 fans paying £20/$25 per month to earn \\~3x the average UK salary or [$75,000](https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html#:\\~:text=no%20matter%20how%20much%20more), so you get the picture.) **With the alignment of technology and the vibe, the impoverished paradigm of community-stricken creatorship is collapsing.**\n\n\n---\n\n### Blockchain is a game-changer for this dynamic\n\n*You’re reading on Mirror, so you probably know all this; you could easily skip to the next phrase in bold.*\n\nIn the early 2020s, new technologies like blockchain, distributed ledgers, and cryptocurrencies really came in vogue. A distributed ledger is triple-entry bookkeeping. [Double-entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping) bookkeeping was invented in medieval Italy: two parties to a transaction would both record it, giving you more data about your business and more verifiable figures, making it easier to trade and pursue enterprise.\n\nEight centuries later, distributed ledgers are triple-entry bookkeeping: as well as the seller and buyer, *every participant in the economy* makes a record of the transaction, and every participant is using the same, enormous, book. Blockchain is the technology of how you add to this book and run software with it, and cryptocurrency is one use case: the ledger essentially records how much currency you own, which everyone verifies. Obviously I’m simplifying, but I’ll refer to these technologies as ‘web3 techs’[11](#footnote-11).\n\nThe significance of blockchain becomes clear upon interrogating why Facebook, YouTube, *et al.* can take such high take rates on creators. One side is [discovery](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does#:\\~:text=no%20one%20finds%20a%20person%20on%20patreon%3B%20you%20go%20there%20after%20you%E2%80%99ve%20found%20them): you rarely *find* creators on Patreon. This happens, still, on big social networks. Everyone is on these platforms (well, not Facebook) and when you consume on these platforms frequently, they’re experts in figuring out what content you’ll click on next; big data, [Markov chains](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-markov-chains-50da3645a50d#:\\~:text=predict%20weather%20for%20days%20to%20come%2C%20based%20on%20what%20the%20current%20weather%20state%20is%20at%20the%20time), etc. There are some problems with this, mainly that you get served addictive content rather than niches that you want to engage deeply in, but generally they do this job pretty well, and web3 techs don’t hugely change this.\n\nBut there are a lot of platforms for discovery — this isn’t the competitive moat it once was. People use Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Pinterest, and much more, in addition to the discovery platforms we’ve called out above; as mentioned, most people have moved beyond Facebook. Creators could just move to whichever discovery network takes the smallest cut of their revenue. Apart from one thing: they can’t. Everything you’ve ever uploaded to Spotify and all the followers you’ve earnt on Insta: the discovery platform manages this, and you can’t take your community with you. So it’s impossible to leave without starting all over again. And hence discovery networks [squeeze](https://stratechery.com/2015/niches-problem-subscription-services/) creators for revenue.\n\nAnd hence, the game-changer. Because just like with your cryptocurrency, you can store your [writing](https://mirror.xyz/), your [music](https://sound.xyz/), your [art](https://opensea.io/), your [videos](https://d.tube/), your [followers](https://lens.xyz/), on a distributed ledger, or “on chain”. As [LBRY](https://lbry.io/) puts it: “LBRY does to publishing what Bitcoin did to money.” Just like with your currency, everyone participating in the economy agrees that “yes, [Leo](https://app.ens.domains/name/leosn.eth/details), you wrote this blog”. Sites like Spotify and Instagram don’t manage your songs and your followers because these songs and follower relationships are stored on chain, and Spotify is reduced to one of many organisations competing to merely display this content in the best way, and help you discover new content as well. Creators are not beholden to any of them – and neither are consumers[12](#footnote-12).\n\nSo now the community economy is fully on the way because finally, **dedicated participants in a niche community can meaningfully support their creators**. When people are deeply engaged in something they care about, even the original consumers become contributors, and we’ll start to see vibrant ecosystems formed around niches and creators. Greg Isenberg explores the [Loot ecosystem](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/heres-what-the-future-of-nfts-looks?s=r#:\\~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20an%20ecosystem%20not%20just%20an%20nft), an NFT project upon which creators have realised myriad different ideas; [Jenkins the Valet](https://www.jenkinsthevalet.com/how-it-works) is a great example of community-led storytelling, which will become a category-defining cultural genre in the 2020s, on par with ‘art’ and ‘literature’. [Jadyn Violet](https://twitter.com/jadynviolet), a musician, told me that “I’ve never got this much interaction on my art before.” He's been spending his time building new ideas to engage his community, spending time speaking with his fans, and making more music — this is what his fans love him for.\n\nBusiness people often talk about the Minimum Viable Product your business needs before you start selling. The MVP isn’t dead, but all businesses (not just creators) will soon require a [Minimum Viable Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uPRruLfZoU&t=2s) to make a mark in their market[13](#footnote-13).\n\nWhat will underlie all of these communities are tokens of membership, probably tiered, which tie a community together. They’ll be non-fungible, which means they’ll be unique and personalisable, thus allowing for deeper engagement. **Consumers get dedicated community and deeper value in a niche they care about; creators are finally rewarded fairly for their work.** \n\n![Tiered NFT collections can help creators build more intimate communities. Everyone wants this; web3 makes it possible.

Google was only just getting started, but after aligning with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, became the favoured search engine of billions.\n\nJoe Kraus, the founder of Excite, [explains why](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=i%20went%20to%20revisit%20joe%20kraus): Excite had been a 20th century company, targeting revenue from the top ten American companies, as media businesses had been doing for decades. Meanwhile, Google focused on attracting advertisers — and millions of them. Why did this work? *“The 20th century was about dozens of markets of millions of consumers. **The 21st century is about millions of markets of dozens of consumers.**”*\n\n\n---\n\n*Hopefully that didn’t actually feel like 3,000 words; I’d love it if you were to [subscribe](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/subscribe) for free or mint one of 5 editions.*\n\n\n---\n\n`Image credits: HelloDorking; Kevin Huynh; Peter Yang`\n\n***Footnotes:***\n\n*Mirror doesn’t do footnote links well yet, but I couldn’t bear to publish without them.*\n\n[1](#footnote-anchor-1) I don’t have the percentage figures for the change in sweetshops and clothing stores, I’m sorry.\n\n[2](#footnote-anchor-2) Other blogging platforms are available, including this one, but they’re still *built* for writers; I’m testing the beta of [Nuance](http://nuance.xyz/).\n\n[3](#footnote-anchor-3) Stratechery anticipated this for (cable) TV in [2013](https://stratechery.com/2013/the-jobs-tv-does/#:\\~:text=the%20jobs%20tv%20has%20traditionally%20done%20include) and watched it happen in [2017](https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/#:\\~:text=tv%20is%20broken%20up%20into%20the%20different%20%E2%80%9Cjobs%E2%80%9D%20it%20has%20traditionally%20done): TV used to keep us **informed**, **educate** us, show **live events**, tell **stories**, and provide **escapism**. But now we get our information from Google; our education from YouTube, Coursera, or Masterworks; our live events from Twitch; our story-telling from Netflix; and our escapism from social media. It’s not as neat as this of course: in reality, everything just exploded into a plethora of mainly mobile options; but unbundling is happening.\n\n[4](#footnote-anchor-4) I number crunched some of the Instagram follower stats [here](https://mention.com/en/reports/instagram/followers/) and would estimate that of all the follower-followee relationships, the largest 1% of accounts receive about 50% of all following relationships.\n\n[5](#footnote-anchor-5) I’m undecided and unclear on what this means for ‘great’ or ‘classic’ cultural contributions. If a great cultural contribution captures an image of society, but also moves it on, how can it be classic, if being classic is continuing to capture that image of society: hasn’t society moved on and been influenced by your contribution? \n\n[6](#footnote-anchor-6) Woodbury is mainly making the argument that it is specifically “a 20th-century culture centered around white leading men” that is dying, but whilst it’s true that celebrities are becoming more diverse, what’s more important is that they’re becoming less relevant. The social media era is dying; the social community era is coming.\n\n[7](#footnote-anchor-7) It’s ironic that in principle ‘agency’ is the most important thing in the world, whilst ‘agencies’ that help brands and creators reach their fans are typically seen as vultures.\n\n[8](#footnote-anchor-8) I also expect niche and tailored content that is ***emphatically artificial***: a further implication of this, from the unrelated and sufficient cause of AI too, is that individuals will asymptote towards consuming cultural content that is tailored just for them: *an audience of one*. As artificial intelligence (which was also covered [last month](http://The asymptote we reach is that for most people, most of the time, their reading and viewing material is created just for them)) gets more able to accurately predict our interests and preferences at a subtle scale, we get to a world in which content is designed – no, generated – to appeal specifically to us. GPT-3 is an OpenAI algorithm that can conduct incredibly lifelike conversation (at times). [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/news/openai-punished-dev-used-gpt-3-to-resurrect-dead-ethics) covers the story of one developer who used the algorithm to sell bots that spoke with the *individual personalities* of an individual chosen by a customer, including dead relatives. As always, there are challenges that accompany change, as well as opportunities; AI will continue to develop, but the risk and threat of AI trained to stimulate and manipulate us need to be managed. *Further reading: [The Diff](https://www.thediff.co/p/what-happens-when-most-media-is-produced?s=r) explores this idea from a more financial perspective; the [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/27/1088140809/fake-linkedin-profiles) illustrates a perfect example, with fake LinkedIn profiles generated explicitly to pique your interest; [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/04/when-your-bot-is-better-than-you.html) touches on the issue from the other perspective, that of the person using the bot.*\n\n[9](#footnote-anchor-9) Sources: Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube stats [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/); in 2021 Spotify paid [$7bn](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) to [8 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) creators, which is $875 or £700 (slightly higher than the claim in the a16z source above).\n\n[10](#footnote-anchor-10) Take the price of Bitcoin as a proxy for ‘web3 in vogue’ for a moment. When a16z published the 100 True Fans articles in February 2020, Bitcoin was worth under <$10k, and wouldn’t get above that price until October. The niche market vibe shift predates the cultural significance of web3 and crypto.\n\n[11](#footnote-anchor-11) I’m simplifying a lot; this isn’t a technical introduction to web3. Most obviously, it’s not the case that each person has to manually agree everything in a distributed ledger. Rather, it’s every computer server; and it’s not every computer server, it’s those who proactively commit to contributing to manage the ledger and communicating with it.

{"id": "21606-NPa0rQtguhKOM0xHBU94Z8QiCyci75vi7zkxE", "title": "Will P2E NFTs evolve into overpriced loot boxes?", "body": "## Long story short, yes, or rather maybe…\n\nYes I know that is as vague as it can be, but let’s try to untangle the non-existing regulation around NFTs and what some recent development in European legislation could mean to the emerging market of NFTs.\n\nWe need to consider two things:\n\n* Are pre-reveal PFP and P2E NFTs loot boxes?\n* If yes, would the loot box legislation apply to them?\n\n### So can we consider NFTs as loot boxes?\n\nWe can and we should.\n\n> Loot boxes are a feature within video games that allow players to partake in a game of chance, exchanging real world money for a randomised in-game item or benefit.\n\nIn this definition our pre-reveal NFTs could be considered randomized in-game items, especially if they are part of a P2E game, given their attributes are randomly generated from legendary 1/1s to uncommon 10000/1s, which would also constitute a game of chance aspect. Can we say that we can exchange these P2E NFTs for real-world money? Of course, even if the P2E game uses a niche crypto token to purchase these NFTs, we still can exchange our tokens for cash on any CEX and vice-versa.\n\n### So would the loot box apply to the NFT market?\n\nProbably would change how we reveal NFTs, but the market as a whole won’t be regulated anytime soon.\n\nThe most recent addition to the not-so-long list of loot box-related regulations comes as consumer groups in 18 European countries jointly announced that they will launch a coordinated call to action to pass regulations on the despicable practices around loot boxes. The 59=page long report details key issues with loot boxes and their mechanism, a few for the sake of understanding the issue:\n\n* Exploiting cognitive biases and vulnerabilities through deceptive design\n* Using aggressive marketing practices to push sales at every opportunity\n* Using layers of virtual currencies to mask or distort real-world monetary costs\n\nEven before the years of the pandemic-induced chaos around the world, legislators tried to look into the issue at hand, most notably in Belgium where EA had to stop selling FIFA points, and in the Netherlands, the company was fined 500,000€ each week they continued selling loot boxes in their games (this decision has been since ruled as unjustified). Following the BENELUX success, the UK government also started a multi-year investigation on whether they could change the gambling legislation to regulate loot boxes accordingly. This was recently published as an overview by the House of Commons Library;\n\n* In September 2019, a House of Commons Committee published a report on technologies that called for regulations to be made to extend the 2005 Act to loot boxes.\n* In June 2020, the Government announced that it would be launching a call for evidence into the impact of loot boxes on gambling-like behavior.\n* A July 2020 House of Lords Committee report on gambling harm also called for loot boxes to be brought within the scope of the Act.\n* On 19 May 2022, the Government said a gambling white paper would be published in the “coming weeks”.\n\nIf we look at these common issues with loot box mechanisms in the video games industry we can see why they would apply to the current P2E market. Imagine a virtual world where you earn or buy virtual tokens that you can exchange for in-game characters or features, this would be per definition the loot box mechanism that the legislators are trying to regulate to keep children safe. In this regards the general PFP market might also fall into this category.\n\n### What can we do about it?\n\nWhile the legislators are working on actually taking care of this problem that is now part of most video games, the NFT market should self-regulate and try to come up with a better solution for pre-reveal PFP NFTs and purchasable P2E NFTs.\n\nDo I have a solution? No.\n\nDo I believe in NFT technology? Yes.", "timestamp": 1654286065, "digest": "t4yQdRwk_ylrk8A6g9dnKqfhy-cr-zVEUeUzv1crb8o", "contributor": "0xC958366ed7225f86D530b8842922e976ABB17974"}

Giao dịch cầu nối này kích hoạt chức năng xác nhận trước vi phạm bằng một tập điều kiện bắt buộc phải thông qua trước khi được phê duyệt. Một trong những điều kiện đấy là khả năng thanh toán của cầu nối giúp đảm bảo rằng khoản đặt cọc và tài sản khoá phải bằng giá trị với những tài sản chuyển đổi.\n\nĐáng tiếc là phương thức cầu nối này có một lỗ hổng trong mã nguồn đã cho phép những kẻ lợi dụng tạo ra thông điệp giả và khai thác tài sản trên chuỗi đích mà không cung cấp đủ tài sản thế chấp trên chuỗi nguồn.

This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market.

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem : Removing the Gatekeepers to Funding Craft Cannabis Operators**\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption.

We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance.

{"id": "-Gqtkwz93Bqer3SpUu8-FHv4PNIUFwoomOG-FrP-g_M", "title": "Will P2E NFTs evolve into overpriced loot boxes?", "body": "## Long story short, yes, or rather maybe…\n\nYes I know that is as vague as it can be, but let’s try to untangle the non-existing regulation around NFTs and what some recent development in European legislation could mean to the emerging market of NFTs.\n\nWe need to consider two things:\n\n* Are pre-reveal PFP and P2E NFTs loot boxes?\n* If yes, would the loot box legislation apply to them?\n\n### So can we consider NFTs as loot boxes?\n\nWe can and we should.\n\n> Loot boxes are a feature within video games that allow players to partake in a game of chance, exchanging real world money for a randomised in-game item or benefit.\n\nIn this definition our pre-reveal NFTs could be considered randomized in-game items, especially if they are part of a P2E game, given their attributes are randomly generated from legendary 1/1s to uncommon 10000/1s, which would also constitute a game of chance aspect. Can we say that we can exchange these P2E NFTs for real-world money? Of course, even if the P2E game uses a niche crypto token to purchase these NFTs, we still can exchange our tokens for cash on any CEX and vice-versa.\n\n### So would the loot box apply to the NFT market?\n\nProbably would change how we reveal NFTs, but the market as a whole won’t be regulated anytime soon.\n\nThe most recent addition to the not-so-long list of loot box-related regulations comes as consumer groups in 18 European countries jointly announced that they will launch a coordinated call to action to pass regulations on the despicable practices around loot boxes. The 59=page long report details key issues with loot boxes and their mechanism, a few for the sake of understanding the issue:\n\n* Exploiting cognitive biases and vulnerabilities through deceptive design\n* Using aggressive marketing practices to push sales at every opportunity\n* Using layers of virtual currencies to mask or distort real-world monetary costs\n\nEven before the years of the pandemic-induced chaos around the world, legislators tried to look into the issue at hand, most notably in Belgium where EA had to stop selling FIFA points, and in the Netherlands, the company was fined 500,000€ each week they continued selling loot boxes in their games (this decision has been since ruled as unjustified). Following the BENELUX success, the UK government also started a multi-year investigation on whether they could change the gambling legislation to regulate loot boxes accordingly. This was recently published as an overview by the House of Commons Library;\n\n* In September 2019, a House of Commons Committee published a report on technologies that called for regulations to be made to extend the 2005 Act to loot boxes.\n* In June 2020, the Government announced that it would be launching a call for evidence into the impact of loot boxes on gambling-like behavior.\n* A July 2020 House of Lords Committee report on gambling harm also called for loot boxes to be brought within the scope of the Act.\n* On 19 May 2022, the Government said a gambling white paper would be published in the “coming weeks”.\n\nIf we look at these common issues with loot box mechanisms in the video games industry we can see why they would apply to the current P2E market. Imagine a virtual world where you earn or buy virtual tokens that you can exchange for in-game characters or features, this would be per definition the loot box mechanism that the legislators are trying to regulate to keep children safe. In this regards the general PFP market might also fall into this category.\n\n### What can we do about it?\n\nWhile the legislators are working on actually taking care of this problem that is now part of most video games, the NFT market should self-regulate and try to come up with a better solution for pre-reveal PFP NFTs and purchasable P2E NFTs.\n\nDo I have a solution? No.\n\nDo I believe in NFT technology? Yes.\n\n> P.S.: Sorry for making this article an NFT, just wanted to try this functionality out.", "timestamp": 1654286199, "digest": "x6_yoG2s8XnpAddchcAdF7qkMKE86b88_pj4-VBiCTM", "contributor": "0xC958366ed7225f86D530b8842922e976ABB17974"}
{"id": "lqWALXe8B_gmU7lqkklkPa-41bEeLQbdwo6wj3df-48", "title": "THE FOOLISHNESS OF PRIDE: AN ESSAY ON CANCEL CULTURE", "body": "What do you think of when I say the words ‘Cancel Culture’?\n\nYou’ll feel some kind of way about it. You’ll either posit that it doesn’t exist (that the cultural practice of ‘cancelling’ is a form of accountability and consequences for bad behavior), that it does exist but isn’t that big of a deal, or that it is a huge cultural problem. At any rate, you have a neuronal pattern that lights up inside of your brain when you process the english word pairing ‘cancel’ and ‘culture’ in immediate succession. Let me extend that for you.\n\nWhether or not ‘cancel culture’ exists does not change the fact that a pattern of consciousness has entered our awareness and we are attempting to name it. We don’t necessarily have clean lines and clear boundaries around what this thing *is*, but enough of us have bumped up against it in some capacity that there’s a collective ‘sense’ that something new is here. There’s some kind of force at work in people, for any number of reasons. Maybe it’s the way that social media incentives are designed; maybe it’s the way that our modes of production have systematically disempowered the vast majority of participants in ‘the market’ and made us feel like collective vitriol is our only recourse in moments of injustice; maybe it’s a general lack of emotional and intellectual maturity in the average user – myself included – leading us to quickly shout unkind hyperbole in the wake of ‘the latest drama’. It’s probably all of these things, but it’s also something deeper and more insidious than that.\n\nCancel Culture is an *Egregore*. Strap in.\n\nThe word *[egregore ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore)*refers to an esoteric concept that was introduced to me by the astrologer [Fairlie Theta](https://thatastrologer.medium.com/). She explained it to mean “an emergent force created and existing through the intellect of large groups of individuals”. It’s like a creature – some kind of semi-divine entity whose body is not physical, but rather, psychological. It exists via distributed thought patterns; it is the embodiment of a meme. While you can’t see it with your eyes, you could if you had some kind of x-ray vision and could pull your focus back a few miles; it’s body is literally the thought patterns that exist in many peoples’ minds simultaneously. Our physical bodies become its cellular loco-motors, our vocal cords and fingertips become its viral vectors, and it does its work on society by hijacking our social incentives and changing our behavior patterns to suit its proliferation.\n\nIt may be useful to define *[meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme)* here as well; in an academic sense, memes (and their accompanying field of research known as *mimetics*) describe self-replicating information that spreads through human communication. The atheist and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins coined the term to deliberately mirror the concept of genes and genetics; whereas genes are bits of *physical* information that self-replicate (through biochemistry), memes are *psychological* or *intellectual* bits of information that self-replicate. When we share a silly video online and suddenly it spirals out into remixes and new interpretations, we are watching the process of mimetic evolution take place in real time. In certain contexts, memes can become totally untethered from their inciting ‘thought’, and can distort existing social incentives to become world-shaping forces of good and evil. Religion is a meme; democracy, too. Memes are a useful tool for understanding the anthropological relationships we all experience in a global society. The concept of the Egregore is a bit like personifying a specific meme-pattern. You take a meme, and you imbue it with being, as though it has a primal intelligence all its own.\n\n*It’s my opinion that, by imbuing an otherwise abstract but observable pattern such as ‘cancel culture’ with a primal intelligence, we become better able to think of ways to productively relate to the concept.* We as individuals only have agency to address something like ‘cancel culture’ in so far as we are able to understand it as a process that operates under its own logic and desire to persist. Ergo, Egregore.\n\n“The Egregore of Cancel Culture” is a bit of a mouthful, though. Let’s condense that to its essence: What human emotion is most at work when we talk about Cancel Culture? What pattern of consciousness does this phenomenon most exalt?\n\nMaybe there really is no such thing as ‘cancel culture’; maybe we’re talking about the material incarnation of *Pride*. The great sin made manifest in the flesh – a bonafide adversary.\n\nAt the core of the idea of ‘cancelling’ (wherein a human being who is perceived by a contingent of society to have done something harmful, abusive, or immoral, becomes the target of a focused campaign of harassment in an effort to inflict psychological or physical harm on the person as a form of retribution) is fueled on almost every level by *shame*. The ‘cancellers’ are wielding shame to try and destroy the mental well-being and social reputation of a perceived target; the target will likely invoke shame towards the cancellers in an effort to protect themselves and their reputation. At the same time, both cancellers and target are (unconsciously) wielding *pride* to justify their position in the dynamic. Pride, after all, is the polarity of shame; these energies produce each other in proportion to their intensity. When we project shame onto others, we do so in part because it makes us feel like we are morally superior to the target of that shame. We play the part of canceller because it makes us feel like we are better than they are and therefore that we have something to be proud of, and we play the part of cancelled for the same reason. How many people now use the fact that they have been cancelled as a branding technique? How many people are twisted into the upside down logic of shame, entirely unaware of how their actions are in service of the extraperceptual superentity known as Pride?\n\n[Eckhart Tolle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle) addresses this phenomenon through the language of the hungry ego. In his work, ‘[A New Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Earth)’, he discusses the way in which our sense of self is habitually conflated with our identity: we forget that *we are not* our name, our history, our memories or our context, but are rather something transcending all of that which has no beginning or end because it is pure ‘awakeness’, pure consciousness. We forget this, because our egos are hungry, and the ego eats by telling itself a story about who and what it is. It was Tolle’s work that made me realize even in moments of self-pity and suicidal depression, the ego is feasting and strengthening itself. We sometimes talk about the ego as though it is only present in those who think highly of themselves, but Tolle’s point seems to be that the ego doesn’t care whether you think of yourself in a positive or negative way – it cares that you think of yourself *at all*, that you think of yourself as *being real*. Your ego can feast voraciously on the idea that you are a bad person deserving of exile, just as surely as it can feast on the notion that you are a good person capable of determining who else is deserving of exile. Egos grow fat on the unconscious and automatic narratives that emerge from drama, conflict, and argument. Egos *crave* conflict; it’s somewhere between a buffet and a day trip to the gymnasium for them. If you spend all of your time embroiled in arguments on the internet about the right politics, you are constantly reinforcing and training your ego.\n\nAnd what is the ego’s most desired delicacy?\n\nPride, and Shame. Which are one and the same.\n\nOur medium of communication – that is, *[social media](https://www.thecenterforsophiologicalstudies.com/post/persona-ideology-the-egregore-and-social-media)*, whose incentives are not spiritual or political but economic – has been designed to exploit this phenomenon for monetary gain. These platforms are fueled by advertising, and by the creation of “*engagement*”, coming from compelling “content”. They are agnostic as to the nature of the content, and are happy to encourage whatever social phenomenon is the most compulsive. As it turns out, the feeding of our egos is extraordinarily effective at this. The whole machine is built like a video game for ego competition. You have a score. You have a player character. You have feedback and gameplay loops. You have metrics for comparing your performance to everyone else who is playing. When you score a ‘hit’ you are rewarded with dings and bells and little red lights and numeric indicators of how effectively you have ‘dunked’ on the other team. Unconsciously, whether you are winning or losing, your ego is *constantly* being bombarded with affirmations. You are loved and cherished, you are unimportant, you are hated, you are respected, you are *known*. *You are real*.\n\nThere is no incentive within the system for large numbers of humans to gain a deeper understanding of how this game works, or to become self-aware about the ways in which we engage in it. On the contrary: the system works best when we are completely incurious about our modes of engagement and allow the algorithm to unscrupulously guide us towards certain topics, certain products, certain kinds of emotional reaction, etcetera. When the phenomenon of a ‘cancellation’ begins, the algorithm detects human engagement and pours gasoline onto the fire, making everyone in everyone’s network simultaneously aware of the opportunity to dive in and be a part of the game. Get it while it’s hot, get those clever dehumanizing meta-ironic comments out there now while it’s trending, because your sense of self-worth is now inextricably connected to how many likes you get on that tweet. If you hesitate, you lose points, and if you can’t get that delicious serotonin, how are you going to get out of bed in the morning? What is the point, in this nihilistic capitalist hellscape?\n\nThe proclivity for mass shaming has always been present in the human species, but its nature and cumulative effect has radically transformed along with our technological development. If you set aside your moral judgments and get curious about the intimate psychological process of ‘cancelling’ as it occurs within a single individual, you’ll see an ancient pattern that once served the vitality of the tribe. If you were a band of hunter-gatherers smaller than [Dunbar’s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number) (150 people or less) and someone in that tribe was accused of some foul transgression, getting the group together to collectively shame the culprit had a good likelihood of producing the desired effect: behavioral change, or true exile of the bad actor. This process served the long term survival of the group; it’s where our impulse to collectively shame *comes from*.\n\nBut, as with our wisdom teeth, evolution is not a perfect process. Internal combustion and circuit boards progress much faster than the biological reality of the human animal does. Our impulses and mental models are squishy and slow whereas our communication networks are now lightning quick, and when you introduce the same bundle of animals into environments with wildly different rules, you get wildly different outcomes. Collective shaming *does not work* in a globally interconnected society of diverse perspectives. We do not have a community of Dunbar’s number – we have communities of *hundreds of millions* *or billions*, all connected through the same server farms, all one IP address away. If you identify a morally deficient agent in the world and you bring your evolutionary tendency for mass shaming to bear on them, how easy it now is for that individual to put out an alarm signal and find themselves brought into and protected by a rival faction who thinks that, actually, *you* are the morally deficient one. The more we give in to that shaming impulse, the more polarized these two perspectives become; the more intense and fierce you become with your campaign to destroy or exile this other person, the more fuel you give to the parallel narrative that you are the ones deserving of punishment, and ironically, the more status you give to your target within their parallel community. The harder and louder and more intensely you attempt to cancel that person – unless they are found convincingly guilty of universally detested behavior, as in the case of someone like Harvey Weinstein – the more power you lend to that person as they splinter away from you. Nothing has changed in the animal behavior; but the technology that augments it has changed the way that equation unfolds.\n\nSo much of these fascinating and chaotic processes are the direct result of our childish relationship with our newfound technological potency. These technologies have had less than a lifetime to mature, and we’ve all had to learn how to use them from the ground up. The conflict and violence present at all levels of our society today is the natural result of handing a bunch of children the tools to wage a global psychic and spiritual war against one another. Meanwhile, the egregores that feast upon our patterns have never been stronger.\n\nPerhaps my desire to contextualize different problems in the world as these emergent eldritch beings is a fool’s errand. Maybe it really doesn’t matter how we think about these things, and maybe projecting this concept of ‘the adversary’ onto these forces won’t affect how people choose to relate to or engage with them. In my heart I find inspiration in the idea that I am waging war against dark angels who care not for the beauty and complexity of an individual human soul. It helps me remember that my enemy is not the person engaging in the destructive behavior, but the destructive behavior itself. It helps me consider how and why that pattern of consciousness is able to become so entrenched, and it helps me think about it not in terms of changing other peoples’ brains but in terms of what this monstrous being eats, and how to deprive it of that food. We evolved to create ‘the other’ – some kind of being outside of our tribe that we can rally against – as a form of protection, and in a global society where we are regularly challenged to understand the whole of humanity as our tribe, I think we may still need ‘the other’. The egregore of Pride feasts upon our shame, and we feed it constantly, unconscious to what we are doing. We default to shaming one another because we’ve inherited these ancient evolutionary patterns and have yet to realize how our indulgences do not serve us, our stated goals, or the well being of our now global tribe. We default to scorn and dismissal because we’re exhausted by the pattern of our lives and it makes dumb animals of us all. We justify our refusal to change these maladaptive processes because we hold pride and shame around them; the idea that we need to change them would require us to grapple with the very uncomfortable notion that *the world is this way because of us*. There is a massive shame looming in our unconscious, held back by the dam we’ve constructed out of pride that tells us, “No, it cannot be our responsibility, we have identified the culprit and it is *them*.”\n\nI think now of the phenomenal quote by the psychedelic shaman Terrence McKenna:\n\n> “Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather bed.”\n\nThe real antidote to shame is not Pride; it’s *courage*. Courage to confront your own inadequacies. Courage to take responsibility for the state of the world. Courage to recognize moments of conflict not as a *them* problem, but rather as your own communication deficiencies. You are missing something, you have not gained the necessary wisdom, you lack compassion or empathy and these are the real reasons you have been unable to have productive discourse. Yes, the systems select against it, yes, social media is designed to foster these communication breakdowns, yes, other people have their parts to play and you cannot be *their* absolution (nor should you allow them to force it upon you), but as a sovereign citizen of this universe, spending any amount of time or energy concerned with *other peoples’* *paths* is a waste of your power. Your path and your actions are what you have power over. There is a looming fear of worthlessness inside of you in direct proportion to how much you project that energy onto others. If you are constantly identifying the moral deficiencies in other human beings, that is the biggest, brightest red flag that somewhere within you, you fear the same deficiency in yourself. Your fear – that is, your lack of courage – may prevent you from looking at this truth in the face, but it is where these conflict patterns come from. If you ever want to heal that wound, you *have* *to have courage*.\n\nThis is the message of the Fool and the Fox, the core principle that brings [the mission of Anthromancer](https://anthromancer.com/pages/about) into focus. To be a Fool is to think of yourself as enlightened as the Fox; but to be a Fox is to recognize that you will always be a Fool, and to embrace that truth with courage and humility. There is nothing to be afraid of; we are all sinners, we are all imperfect unfolding processes within the perfect fabric of creation. Our past transgressions and the deep vitriol we’ve held for those we perceive as committing wicked deeds of their own, like all forces in nature, change over time. They are not static and eternal judgments against a person’s very soul. They are moments that we experience in the grip of truth, and then move through, as the truth itself transforms around us. This is the nature of all things, yet we treat ourselves and others as though momentary judgments become the de-facto rule of a person’s eternal totality. This is, as the buddha would say, wrong thinking, and the whole world begins to heal when we correct such wrong thinking inside our own minds.\n\nAs I revise this essay I find it interesting I should feel compelled to write it at the beginning of Pride month. Pride – the festival of liberation from shame that was created in the wake of the 1969 Stonewall Riots as lesbian, gay and transgender people from all backgrounds stood up for their right to exist as they were without shame – is really a movement of *courage*. It makes sense that people who had lived under the constant oppressive force of shame for something inherent to their identity would create a movement named after what is seen as the opposite of that oppressive force. And it’s not really my place to tell anyone how they should posture and what label they should use. But in its most divine incarnation, the lessons the rest of the world can learn from the queer community have nothing to do with “pride”, and everything to do with courage – the courage to face the imposition of shame and remain unmoved by it. The courage to accept that some people will want you to die simply for existing in your natural state, and to choose not to allow that fear to prevent you from chasing that authenticity. The courage to stand up in the face of psychological and physical acts of violence, knowing that you may suffer obliteration. It’s about courage.\n\nReactionary religious voices will look at the aesthetics – that is, the label of “pride” – and quake in their boots at what they perceive to be the most depraved distortion of deadly sin into holy virtue, and warn their children against it, and disown members of their own family, and fracture the human tribe in the wake of their own hidden shame, more concerned with keeping up appearances in their community and ‘the eyes of God’ than in deep reflection and curious investigation into the real patterns that govern all of these processes. They, too, are gripped by the tendrils of Pride. They forget themselves and they forget the lessons of their own scripture; they fall into patterns of fear and perceive them as patterns of love, seemingly unaware of what faith really means, and how bulletproof true faith in God’s love ought to make you feel. They subsume their power into ideologues and political charlatans and make the same kinds of cancel culture justifications for casting their own flesh and blood out into the world, and lack the courage to inquire into their own reasons for doing this...because the egregore of pride and shame has totally colonized the minds of *everyone* in our society.\n\nIn this sense, I find the LGBTQ community’s generational attempts to exist in public without shame to be one of the more divine manifestations of love in the world. Here is a group of people who are casting off the shame that society imposes on them in its pride. Here is a group of people who are trying, perhaps imperfectly at times, to make a world that is more kind and more accepting of different ways of being, so long as those ways of being do not harm others. Perhaps they are all prideful fools...but so are we all. It isn’t something we chose. It is something we inherited, and it is our responsibility to become aware of that pattern and to choose something different. That starts with how we choose to relate to one another. It starts with how we choose to relate to ourselves. And more than anything, it starts with courage; the courage to love ourselves and to love those who hate us, to love our imperfections and the imperfections of others, and to understand what a gift we are giving ourselves in doing so.\n\nI believe this is what Jesus of Nazareth was trying to teach the world when he died trying to absolve us of our sins; the point is that your sins do not condemn you. We are all sinners, we are not alone, and we have nothing to be afraid of. It is what it is, and you are still worthy of love. It does not matter who you are, where you’ve been, or what you’ve done, and it does not matter what other people say or think about you; the love we are talking about is the most radical love imaginable. It’s love beyond measure. It’s infinite, and eternal, and it’s always one tuning of your consciousness away; it’s always there for you, once you’ve got the tools you need to access it. It doesn’t matter what language you speak, what holy book you read, or if you even believe that God is real. The love we’re talking about doesn’t care about any of these superficial cosmic hashtags. It cares about one thing, and one thing only:\n\nCourage.\n\nHow wicked do we become when we operate from a place of fear? How twisted do our values get when we filter them through the axis of pride and shame? How useless is our creative agency when we lose sight of what we actually want, and fail to build logical frameworks for how to achieve those goals, because we’re torqued up in a maelstrom of low-vibrational animal reactivity?\n\nDo you want to build a better world? You cannot do it alone. You cannot exile and shame your way towards a more enlightened humanity. You cannot genocide the undesirables, no matter what your criteria for what ‘undesirable’ means. You have to deepen your love and lift people up, not with weakness, but with strength; not with suspicion, but with faith; not with fear, but with courage. Our hollow institutions aren’t going to suddenly become enlightened until we kill the egregores that own them. That’s a battle that starts right here, right now, in you.\n\nHow do you want to do this?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZX1Ef40WFoIx8b1KomvvW.png?height=470&width=470)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654286346, "digest": "a0CDwxWVw1rOva5isM6XOFpT3e8Eumwrn62A14QRIWk", "contributor": "0x9BBD84d92Db21D628BF78e2196677bB9F10366d3"}

{"id": "0ZketvjBBFHPKjUQS8zs_TqFQv55bahu9IOh036uLik", "title": "Web3.0是否Z世代的救贖？", "body": "## 引言\n\n當代的年輕人是很悲情的一代。讀著似乎永遠讀不完的書，考著一個接一個的試。比分數、鬥Intern，也仿佛成爲了我們從出生便刻在骨子裏的軍備競賽。出了社會，也發現蛋糕早已被分得所剩無幾，我們如行尸走肉般走在被規劃好的路綫上，沒有人關心我們所想要的是什麽。「有辦法讓我們衝出這樣的桎梏嗎？」\n\n「有，Web3.0。」\n\n## 什麽是Web3.0？\n\n提起Web3.0，或許我們首先要去認識什麽是Web3.0，説到這裏，我們就有必要對Web1.0 – Web2.0的時代做一個簡單的回顧。\n\n在Web1.0時代，大部分的用戶只能作爲内容（content）的消費者，而内容的生產者大多為職業或者是專業的内容生產者，例如AOL或者是早年的雅虎門戶就屬於這一類型的產品。這個階段的互聯網主要特徵是：可讀。\n\n到了Web2.0時代，隨著越來越多人開始關注互聯網，也讓一些靠著互聯網建立影響力的人崛起（KOL），互聯網的用戶也從只閲讀内容的消費者，漸漸地轉變成爲了既可閲讀也可生產的「生產消費者」（Prosumer），如Youtube、Instagram或Tiktok這一類型的產品就屬於Web2.0的應用。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫。\n\n到了2008年，自一位化名為中本聰的人發表了《比特幣白皮書》後，Web3.0的概念也漸漸進入了人們的視野。在這個階段，互聯網的用戶不僅可以閲讀、生產内容，甚至可以成爲内容的擁有者（Owner）。也就是說，以往的内容所有權是被平臺所掌控的，一旦平臺消失或者刪除某個用戶的内容，用戶便會因此遭受損失。而在Web3.0的時代，用戶的内容是以加密貨幣或者數字產權作爲主要的載體，是所有者的一項資產，無法被中心化平臺所剝奪。目前來看，Mirror便是這一類型的產品。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫+可有。\n\n## 爲什麽Web3.0如此迷人？\n\n### 「創作者經濟」\n\n首先，我們要理解一點，内容的所有權爲我們帶來的是對我們在網絡上每個行爲的定價。擧個例子，阿强創作了一張迷因圖（Meme），并且把它鑄造成了一個NFT，那這張迷因就是有價值的。（留意是價值，而非價格）在這個基礎下，這便有助於推動「創作者經濟」（creator economy）愈加蓬勃。\n\n[根據2021年的基準報告](https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-earnings-benchmark-report/)，目前創作者經濟的市場規模已經達到了1042億美元，而對於創作者經濟領域的投資也在2021年達到了創紀錄的13億美元，這表現出了這個領域目前蓬勃的生命力。越來越多的意見領袖「KOL」透過自己的創作、想法和影響力爲自己帶來了可觀的收入。然而，儘管許多的創作者嘔心瀝血地奉獻了自己的創意，可是他們并不能獲得相應的經濟回報。[例如擁有百萬訂閱者的Youtuber平均年廣告收入只有6萬美金，而Spotify上超過700萬播放量的音樂人中，只有0.2%的人每年版稅收入超過5萬美元](https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022)，可見創作者的大部分收入都被平臺和廣告商所蠶食，這並不是一個創作者，或是創作者的支持者所願意看到的。\n\n而在Web3.0的時代，創作者將不再是一個平臺的產品，他們可以作爲一個獨立的經濟體而存在。在Web3.0的時代，創作者們可以透過發佈NFT和社交代幣從而建立自己的粉絲社區，讓創作者可以透過除了廣告以外的方式把自己的流量變現。同時，支持者們同樣享受著隨著社區日益發展而帶來的經濟收益，形成社區蓬勃發展→創作者與支持者共同盈利→創作者獲得越來越多支持者的正向循環。同時，代幣跨越平臺與國家的屬性也為創作者提供了真正的全球市場。正如[Commsor 創始人 Mac Reddin](http://theteaguns/)所說：「創作者不需要統治世界，他們只需要一個擁有強大社區的小眾市場。創作者也有能力嘗試更多新事物，因此我們看到創作者空間中出現了有趣的社區，包括 NFT、社交資金、新平台等。」簡單來説，就是將創作者視爲一家公司，而支持者們都是他的股東。\n\n![Web3.0的相關應用（資料來源：https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Uh44JA0k6zK03ft8Gopw.avif?height=675&width=1200)\n\n從另一個角度看，Web3.0同時也讓每個創作者的輸出都可以轉換為他的經濟來源。比如一個網絡小說家可以透過賣他的小說，將其文章的初稿作為NFT販賣，讓熱愛他文章的讀者可以購買收藏。同時作者還可以從NFT的每次交易中抽取一定比例的交易稅，讓每個創作者都可以透過創作養活自己。\n\n### 「還權於民」\n\nWeb3.0更加吸引我的，在其「還權於民」的思想。\n\n在傳統的Web2.0時代，中心化的機構掌握著絕對的權力，他們掌管著我們每一個用戶的數據，這使得推特、Facebook、阿里巴巴和微博這樣的公司權力得以無限膨脹。他們可以肆意的瀏覽用戶的隱私、將數據歸爲己有以此謀利，甚至還可以透過這些數據操縱群衆的思想。這樣説起來似乎很誇張，但卻也是我們無可否認的事實。大平臺可以透過各類算法給我們喜歡看的内容，同時，他們也可以決定讓我們看到什麽。近年Facebook泄露用戶信息以及被指利用社交媒體操縱選舉的指控也將其被推上輿論的風口浪尖；特朗普多次被推特禁言一事也促使了他開辦自己的社交平臺。\n\n`「我們看似是自由的，卻只能看見那些他們想讓我們看到的，」`\n\n加密與Web3.0的精神在於自由和自主。在Web3.0的世界，每個用戶都掌控著自己的數據，讓數據的權力不再只限於機構與國家，而是歸還予每個人，而尊重個體的利益，任何的平臺不得在未經授權的情況下使用或者篡改用戶的數據，這就是Web3.0的核心精神。而我相信，人類的進程是向自由和自主發展的，而非獨裁和專制。\n\n## Z世代所面臨的問題\n\n回到主題，爲什麽要說Web3.0是Z世代的救贖？首先，我們要知我們Z世代到底在面臨著什麽。當我們從小學讀到中學，努力考上大學，再辛苦點的讀個Master、PHD，然後出到社會發現，原來這個社會的資源劃分已經早早的結束了，社會階級已經形成了固化。認命的，打份牛工，朝九晚八，然後發現到月底錢又沒了。節省點的，每個月存一點，沒有娛樂、沒有享受，一點一點地存錢買了套房子，房產證到手，半輩子沒了。不信命的，滿腔熱血地跑去創業，發現無論哪個行業競爭都大，自己卻沒經驗沒人脈，白白地葬送青春。不幸地，當我們從踏出學校門口那一瞬間，畢業就變成了失業。在中國，[今年畢業規模首超千萬](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-61632336)，16-24歲的失業率也達到了驚人的18.2%，即幾乎每五個16-24歲數的年輕人中就有一個人處於沒有工作的狀態，而即使放眼全世界，我們似乎都在面臨著同一個難題。\n\n## 爲什麽Z世代與Web3.0如此契合？\n\n然而，我們似乎與Web3.0有著完美的契合度。我們從小便在網絡世界中長大，對於新事物的理解與接受都有著很强的包容程度。而在香港，我們這一代人對於自由、良知與公義有著堅定的追求，我們追求個人權力的自主，討厭極權與專制，我們有著驚人的創意與創造力，這與Web3.0有著天然的契合。\n\n而作爲一個Z世代，我們也厭倦了朝九晚八這種機械式的生活，我們渴望能夠有著靈活的上班時間，我們也渴望能在任何地方工作；我們并不討厭工作，卻討厭被束縛，我們渴望對自己的日常行程有著絕對的自主權；我們覺得自己的靈魂是有價值的，我們有著我們所熱愛的事情，我們在乎麵包，可也希望能夠做著喜歡的事情來賺取我們的麵包；我們有壓力，卻也渴望快樂，我們希望兩者能夠平衡，而不是用著僅有的快樂來抗住如山的壓力。也正因爲如此，大多數的「我們」，[不再想成爲律師、醫生或者銀行家](https://www.antler.co/blog/the-creator-economy-boom-what-it-is-whats-driving)，而是，作爲一個創作者昂然踏足在自己的人生道路上，也正因如此，Web3.0才如此適合我們。\n\n過去的一年裏，我常常流連於許多NFT社區，發現炒NFT的許多人都是與我年齡相若的年輕人，他們很懂得社區與文化的價值，這也是很多玩Defi的old money（相對的）所不理解的。Z世代對於文化的創造和理解是很擅長的，一群志趣相投的Z世代聚在一起很快就可以形成一股Vibe，同時我們也很容易被一些有趣的Vibe所感染，像是Mfer就傳達出一種「我就爛」的Vibe就特別觸動我，而像是BAYC這種龍頭項目也讓人感到Flexing的感覺。而NFT作爲Web3.0社區與文化的催化劑，每一個NFT都能代表著社區的生命力和創造力，而Z世代們對此的嗅覺便像是與生俱來的。\n\n## Web3.0目前的困境\n\n### Web2.0與Web3.0\n\n「但Web3.0必然是我們這一代人的答案嗎？」「不是必然。」以目前來講，Web3.0還有許多的問題需要我們去探討以及解決。首先第一個問題我想引用漢陽老師在[《Web 3 批评的对与错：一次讨论》](https://masterpa.mirror.xyz/RYr8_XToc5UvC6iB6pj7zp39MRA00ZvHD05m5giddIM)這篇文章中的一段話。\n\n> Web 3 的几乎所有论点，都是伴随着对 Web 2.0 的某个批评而生的。Web 2.0 不保护隐私，Web 3 就保护；Web 2.0 不给创作者分成，Web 3 就给；Web 2.0 不能让用户共享平台收益，Web 3 就发 Token 一起投票。Web 3 不一定是一个更好的互联网，它目前是一个反对 Web 2.0 的互联网。\n\n目前的Web3.0對Web2.0存在一個内在的依附性，每每論及Web3.0似乎都無法脫離Web2.0來進行論述，支持Web3.0的論點似乎全然是建基於反對Web2.0之上的，而卻沒有一個普遍認同的觀點能讓Web3.0能夠獨立成型，説服大衆它就是「最好的互聯網」。這也是所有Web3.0的擁護者需要面對的一個問題，離開了Web2.0，Web3.0還剩下什麽？這也是我們所需要思考的。\n\n### 炒作周期\n\n2020-2021年對於加密貨幣市場來説是瘋狂的一年，在這期間，比特幣從1萬多上漲到了6萬9，各式各樣的加密貨幣概念滿天飛，gamefi、defi、元宇宙、Web3.0，塑造了無數個造富神話，正如Charlie Munger所說：「[我們正處於一個比互聯網時代更瘋狂的時代](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/12/03/berkshires-munger-says-now-even-crazier-than-dot-com-bust/?slreturn=20211106151609)」。然而，截至今日（2022/6/4），比特幣已經從高位下跌超過五成，各類Altcoin也早已跌得不成人形，大浪退去，幾乎沒有一個人穿著褲子。這時候我們才發現，原來所有的概念都是空中樓閣，經不起考驗。\n\n目前來看，Web3.0似乎還沒有爲這個世界留下實質性的應用，連Stepn這種被譽為開創性的應用似乎也無法在熊市的大環境下繼續生存，那些反對加密貨幣的群體又可以再次高呼「區塊鏈騙局」的口號，但這是否代表著Web3.0將會是再一個龐氏騙局呢？經濟學家Carlota Perez在《*[技术革命与金融资本](https://www.amazon.com/Technological-Revolutions-Financial-Capital-Dynamics/dp/1843763311)*》一書中提到了一個觀點：在過去幾百年的每一次重大工業變革，都伴隨著泡沫，而隨著這些投機泡沫的破裂，那些留下來的技術，也會逐漸發展成熟，融入我們的生活當中，從而完成技術革命，例如第一次工業革命爲我們帶來了運河和道路網絡，第二次工業革命爲我們帶來了鐵路、港口和郵政，第三次工業革命則是電力和配電網絡，石油時代爲我們提供了公路與機場，互聯網時代讓電信通訊與互聯網徹底地融入了我們的生活。\n\n值得一提的是，Carlota Perez認爲「真正的技術革命必須伴隨著大量基礎設施的發展」，因此，我們不應該把全部的目光投放在那些像是Axie、Stepn或是Sandbox這樣的應用層上，而是應該留意Ethereum、Solana這樣的公鏈，或是Arweave、Metamask這類的基礎建設的發展，這些項目才是奠定Web3.0的基礎。要知道，在互聯網泡沫破滅之前，我們并沒有Google Map、沒有Youtube、沒有Instagram、也沒有Tiktok。即使它們在當時並不存在，但卻不阻礙以幹綫技術、數據服務設施以及用戶設施所組成的互聯網推動了世界，改變了我們的生活。或許我們也不需要用我們目前的認知去預測未來Web3.0的樣子，將Web2.0的應用對標到Web3.0上，想象一個Web3.0的Instagram或者是一個Web3.0的Tiktok是沒有意義的。一個真正能夠改變世界的Web3.0應用不需要取代Web2.0的任何一個誰，它將會一款是開創性的、顛覆我們認知的產品，將每個人的生活變得更好。而我們需要做的，便是觀察、等待，伺機乘上這股時代的潮流。\n\n###

引言\n\n當代的年輕人是很悲情的一代。讀著似乎永遠讀不完的書，考著一個接一個的試。比分數、鬥Intern，也仿佛成爲了我們從出生便刻在骨子裏的軍備競賽。出了社會，也發現蛋糕早已被分得所剩無幾，我們如行尸走肉般走在被規劃好的路綫上，沒有人關心我們所想要的是什麽。「有辦法讓我們衝出這樣的桎梏嗎？」\n\n「有，Web3.0。」\n\n## 什麽是Web3.0？\n\n提起Web3.0，或許我們首先要去認識什麽是Web3.0，説到這裏，我們就有必要對Web1.0 – Web2.0的時代做一個簡單的回顧。\n\n在Web1.0時代，大部分的用戶只能作爲内容（content）的消費者，而内容的生產者大多為職業或者是專業的内容生產者，例如AOL或者是早年的雅虎門戶就屬於這一類型的產品。這個階段的互聯網主要特徵是：可讀。\n\n到了Web2.0時代，隨著越來越多人開始關注互聯網，也讓一些靠著互聯網建立影響力的人崛起（KOL），互聯網的用戶也從只閲讀内容的消費者，漸漸地轉變成爲了既可閲讀也可生產的「生產消費者」（Prosumer），如Youtube、Instagram或Tiktok這一類型的產品就屬於Web2.0的應用。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫。\n\n到了2008年，自一位化名為中本聰的人發表了《比特幣白皮書》後，Web3.0的概念也漸漸進入了人們的視野。在這個階段，互聯網的用戶不僅可以閲讀、生產内容，甚至可以成爲内容的擁有者（Owner）。也就是說，以往的内容所有權是被平臺所掌控的，一旦平臺消失或者刪除某個用戶的内容，用戶便會因此遭受損失。而在Web3.0的時代，用戶的内容是以加密貨幣或者數字產權作爲主要的載體，是所有者的一項資產，無法被中心化平臺所剝奪。目前來看，Mirror便是這一類型的產品。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫+可有。\n\n## 爲什麽Web3.0如此迷人？\n\n### 「創作者經濟」\n\n首先，我們要理解一點，内容的所有權爲我們帶來的是對我們在網絡上每個行爲的定價。擧個例子，阿强創作了一張迷因圖（Meme），并且把它鑄造成了一個NFT，那這張迷因就是有價值的。（留意是價值，而非價格）在這個基礎下，這便有助於推動「創作者經濟」（creator economy）愈加蓬勃。\n\n[根據2021年的基準報告](https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-earnings-benchmark-report/)，目前創作者經濟的市場規模已經達到了1042億美元，而對於創作者經濟領域的投資也在2021年達到了創紀錄的13億美元，這表現出了這個領域目前蓬勃的生命力。越來越多的意見領袖「KOL」透過自己的創作、想法和影響力爲自己帶來了可觀的收入。然而，儘管許多的創作者嘔心瀝血地奉獻了自己的創意，可是他們并不能獲得相應的經濟回報。[例如擁有百萬訂閱者的Youtuber平均年廣告收入只有6萬美金，而Spotify上超過700萬播放量的音樂人中，只有0.2%的人每年版稅收入超過5萬美元](https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022)，可見創作者的大部分收入都被平臺和廣告商所蠶食，這並不是一個創作者，或是創作者的支持者所願意看到的。\n\n而在Web3.0的時代，創作者將不再是一個平臺的產品，他們可以作爲一個獨立的經濟體而存在。在Web3.0的時代，創作者們可以透過發佈NFT和社交代幣從而建立自己的粉絲社區，讓創作者可以透過除了廣告以外的方式把自己的流量變現。同時，支持者們同樣享受著隨著社區日益發展而帶來的經濟收益，形成社區蓬勃發展→創作者與支持者共同盈利→創作者獲得越來越多支持者的正向循環。同時，代幣跨越平臺與國家的屬性也為創作者提供了真正的全球市場。正如[Commsor 創始人 Mac Reddin](http://theteaguns/)所說：「創作者不需要統治世界，他們只需要一個擁有強大社區的小眾市場。創作者也有能力嘗試更多新事物，因此我們看到創作者空間中出現了有趣的社區，包括 NFT、社交資金、新平台等。」簡單來説，就是將創作者視爲一家公司，而支持者們都是他的股東。\n\n![Web3.0的相關應用（資料來源：https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Uh44JA0k6zK03ft8Gopw.avif?height=675&width=1200)\n\n從另一個角度看，Web3.0同時也讓每個創作者的輸出都可以轉換為他的經濟來源。比如一個網絡小說家可以透過賣他的小說，將其文章的初稿作為NFT販賣，讓熱愛他文章的讀者可以購買收藏。同時作者還可以從NFT的每次交易中抽取一定比例的交易稅，讓每個創作者都可以透過創作養活自己。\n\n### 「還權於民」\n\nWeb3.0更加吸引我的，在其「還權於民」的思想。\n\n在傳統的Web2.0時代，中心化的機構掌握著絕對的權力，他們掌管著我們每一個用戶的數據，這使得推特、Facebook、阿里巴巴和微博這樣的公司權力得以無限膨脹。他們可以肆意的瀏覽用戶的隱私、將數據歸爲己有以此謀利，甚至還可以透過這些數據操縱群衆的思想。這樣説起來似乎很誇張，但卻也是我們無可否認的事實。大平臺可以透過各類算法給我們喜歡看的内容，同時，他們也可以決定讓我們看到什麽。近年Facebook泄露用戶信息以及被指利用社交媒體操縱選舉的指控也將其被推上輿論的風口浪尖；特朗普多次被推特禁言一事也促使了他開辦自己的社交平臺。\n\n`「我們看似是自由的，卻只能看見那些他們想讓我們看到的，」`\n\n加密與Web3.0的精神在於自由和自主。在Web3.0的世界，每個用戶都掌控著自己的數據，讓數據的權力不再只限於機構與國家，而是歸還予每個人，而尊重個體的利益，任何的平臺不得在未經授權的情況下使用或者篡改用戶的數據，這就是Web3.0的核心精神。而我相信，人類的進程是向自由和自主發展的，而非獨裁和專制。\n\n## Z世代所面臨的問題\n\n回到主題，爲什麽要說Web3.0是Z世代的救贖？首先，我們要知我們Z世代到底在面臨著什麽。當我們從小學讀到中學，努力考上大學，再辛苦點的讀個Master、PHD，然後出到社會發現，原來這個社會的資源劃分已經早早的結束了，社會階級已經形成了固化。認命的，打份牛工，朝九晚八，然後發現到月底錢又沒了。節省點的，每個月存一點，沒有娛樂、沒有享受，一點一點地存錢買了套房子，房產證到手，半輩子沒了。不信命的，滿腔熱血地跑去創業，發現無論哪個行業競爭都大，自己卻沒經驗沒人脈，白白地葬送青春。不幸地，當我們從踏出學校門口那一瞬間，畢業就變成了失業。在中國，[今年畢業規模首超千萬](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-61632336)，16-24歲的失業率也達到了驚人的18.2%，即幾乎每五個16-24歲數的年輕人中就有一個人處於沒有工作的狀態，而即使放眼全世界，我們似乎都在面臨著同一個難題。\n\n## 爲什麽Z世代與Web3.0如此契合？\n\n然而，我們似乎與Web3.0有著完美的契合度。我們從小便在網絡世界中長大，對於新事物的理解與接受都有著很强的包容程度。而在香港，我們這一代人對於自由、良知與公義有著堅定的追求，我們追求個人權力的自主，討厭極權與專制，我們有著驚人的創意與創造力，這與Web3.0有著天然的契合。\n\n而作爲一個Z世代，我們也厭倦了朝九晚八這種機械式的生活，我們渴望能夠有著靈活的上班時間，我們也渴望能在任何地方工作；我們并不討厭工作，卻討厭被束縛，我們渴望對自己的日常行程有著絕對的自主權；我們覺得自己的靈魂是有價值的，我們有著我們所熱愛的事情，我們在乎麵包，可也希望能夠做著喜歡的事情來賺取我們的麵包；我們有壓力，卻也渴望快樂，我們希望兩者能夠平衡，而不是用著僅有的快樂來抗住如山的壓力。也正因爲如此，大多數的「我們」，[不再想成爲律師、醫生或者銀行家](https://www.antler.co/blog/the-creator-economy-boom-what-it-is-whats-driving)，而是，作爲一個創作者昂然踏足在自己的人生道路上，也正因如此，Web3.0才如此適合我們。\n\n過去的一年裏，我常常流連於許多NFT社區，發現炒NFT的許多人都是與我年齡相若的年輕人，他們很懂得社區與文化的價值，這也是很多玩Defi的old

而作爲一個Z世代，我們也厭倦了朝九晚八這種機械式的生活，我們渴望能夠有著靈活的上班時間，我們也渴望能在任何地方工作；我們并不討厭工作，卻討厭被束縛，我們渴望對自己的日常行程有著絕對的自主權；我們覺得自己的靈魂是有價值的，我們有著我們所熱愛的事情，我們在乎麵包，可也希望能夠做著喜歡的事情來賺取我們的麵包；我們有壓力，卻也渴望快樂，我們希望兩者能夠平衡，而不是用著僅有的快樂來抗住如山的壓力。也正因爲如此，大多數的「我們」，[不再想成爲律師、醫生或者銀行家](https://www.antler.co/blog/the-creator-economy-boom-what-it-is-whats-driving)，而是，作爲一個創作者昂然踏足在自己的人生道路上，也正因如此，Web3.0才如此適合我們。\n\n        過去的一年裏，我常常流連於許多NFT社區，發現炒NFT的許多人都是與我年齡相若的年輕人，他們很懂得社區與文化的價值，這也是很多玩Defi的old money（相對的）所不理解的。Z世代對於文化的創造和理解是很擅長的，一群志趣相投的Z世代聚在一起很快就可以形成一股Vibe，同時我們也很容易被一些有趣的Vibe所感染，像是Mfer就傳達出一種「我就爛」的Vibe就特別觸動我，而像是BAYC這種龍頭項目也讓人感到Flexing的感覺。而NFT作爲Web3.0社區與文化的催化劑，每一個NFT都能代表著社區的生命力和創造力，而Z世代們對此的嗅覺便像是與生俱來的。\n\n## Web3.0目前的困境\n\n### Web2.0與Web3.0\n\n        「但Web3.0必然是我們這一代人的答案嗎？」「不是必然。」以目前來講，Web3.0還有許多的問題需要我們去探討以及解決。首先第一個問題我想引用漢陽老師在[《Web 3 批评的对与错：一次讨论》](https://masterpa.mirror.xyz/RYr8_XToc5UvC6iB6pj7zp39MRA00ZvHD05m5giddIM)這篇文章中的一段話。\n\n>         Web 3 的几乎所有论点，都是伴随着对 Web 2.0 的某个批评而生的。Web 2.0 不保护隐私，Web 3 就保护；Web 2.0 不给创作者分成，Web 3 就给；Web 2.0 不能让用户共享平台收益，Web 3 就发 Token 一起投票。Web 3 不一定是一个更好的互联网，它目前是一个反对 Web 2.0 的互联网。\n\n        目前的Web3.0對Web2.0存在一個内在的依附性，每每論及Web3.0似乎都無法脫離Web2.0來進行論述，支持Web3.0的論點似乎全然是建基於反對Web2.0之上的，而卻沒有一個普遍認同的觀點能讓Web3.0能夠獨立成型，説服大衆它就是「最好的互聯網」。這也是所有Web3.0的擁護者需要面對的一個問題，離開了Web2.0，Web3.0還剩下什麽？這也是我們所需要思考的。\n\n### 炒作周期\n\n        2020-2021年對於加密貨幣市場來説是瘋狂的一年，在這期間，比特幣從1萬多上漲到了6萬9，各式各樣的加密貨幣概念滿天飛，gamefi、defi、元宇宙、Web3.0，塑造了無數個造富神話，正如Charlie Munger所說：「[我們正處於一個比互聯網時代更瘋狂的時代](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/12/03/berkshires-munger-says-now-even-crazier-than-dot-com-bust/?slreturn=20211106151609)」。然而，截至今日（2022/6/4），比特幣已經從高位下跌超過五成，各類Altcoin也早已跌得不成人形，大浪退去，幾乎沒有一個人穿著褲子。這時候我們才發現，原來所有的概念都是空中樓閣，經不起考驗。\n\n        目前來看，Web3.0似乎還沒有爲這個世界留下實質性的應用，連Stepn這種被譽為開創性的應用似乎也無法在熊市的大環境下繼續生存，那些反對加密貨幣的群體又可以再次高呼「區塊鏈騙局」的口號，但這是否代表著Web3.0將會是再一個龐氏騙局呢？經濟學家Carlota Perez在《*[技术革命与金融资本](https://www.amazon.com/Technological-Revolutions-Financial-Capital-Dynamics/dp/1843763311)*》一書中提到了一個觀點：在過去幾百年的每一次重大工業變革，都伴隨著泡沫，而隨著這些投機泡沫的破裂，那些留下來的技術，也會逐漸發展成熟，融入我們的生活當中，從而完成技術革命，例如第一次工業革命爲我們帶來了運河和道路網絡，第二次工業革命爲我們帶來了鐵路、港口和郵政，第三次工業革命則是電力和配電網絡，石油時代爲我們提供了公路與機場，互聯網時代讓電信通訊與互聯網徹底地融入了我們的生活。\n\n        值得一提的是，Carlota Perez認爲「真正的技術革命必須伴隨著大量基礎設施的發展」，因此，我們不應該把全部的目光投放在那些像是Axie、Stepn或是Sandbox這樣的應用層上，而是應該留意Ethereum、Solana這樣的公鏈，或是Arweave、Metamask這類的基礎建設的發展，這些項目才是奠定Web3.0的基礎。要知道，在互聯網泡沫破滅之前，我們并沒有Google Map、沒有Youtube、沒有Instagram、也沒有Tiktok。即使它們在當時並不存在，但卻不阻礙以幹綫技術、數據服務設施以及用戶設施所組成的互聯網推動了世界，改變了我們的生活。或許我們也不需要用我們目前的認知去預測未來Web3.0的樣子，將Web2.0的應用對標到Web3.0上，想象一個Web3.0的Instagram或者是一個Web3.0的Tiktok是沒有意義的。一個真正能夠改變世界的Web3.0應用不需要取代Web2.0的任何一個誰，它將會一款是開創性的、顛覆我們認知的產品，將每個人的生活變得更好。而我們需要做的，便是觀察、等待，伺機乘上這股時代的潮流。\n\n###

當代的年輕人是很悲情的一代。讀著似乎永遠讀不完的書，考著一個接一個的試。比分數、鬥Intern，也仿佛成爲了我們從出生便刻在骨子裏的軍備競賽。出了社會，也發現蛋糕早已被分得所剩無幾，我們如行尸走肉般走在被規劃好的路綫上，沒有人關心我們所想要的是什麽。「有辦法讓我們衝出這樣的桎梏嗎？」\n\n \n\n        「有，Web3.0。」\n\n## 什麽是Web3.0？\n\n        提起Web3.0，或許我們首先要去認識什麽是Web3.0，説到這裏，我們就有必要對Web1.0 – Web2.0的時代做一個簡單的回顧。\n\n        在Web1.0時代，大部分的用戶只能作爲内容（content）的消費者，而内容的生產者大多為職業或者是專業的内容生產者，例如AOL或者是早年的雅虎門戶就屬於這一類型的產品。這個階段的互聯網主要特徵是：可讀。\n\n        到了Web2.0時代，隨著越來越多人開始關注互聯網，也讓一些靠著互聯網建立影響力的人崛起（KOL），互聯網的用戶也從只閲讀内容的消費者，漸漸地轉變成爲了既可閲讀也可生產的「生產消費者」（Prosumer），如Youtube、Instagram或Tiktok這一類型的產品就屬於Web2.0的應用。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫。 \n\n        到了2008年，自一位化名為中本聰的人發表了《比特幣白皮書》後，Web3.0的概念也漸漸進入了人們的視野。在這個階段，互聯網的用戶不僅可以閲讀、生產内容，甚至可以成爲内容的擁有者（Owner）。也就是說，以往的内容所有權是被平臺所掌控的，一旦平臺消失或者刪除某個用戶的内容，用戶便會因此遭受損失。而在Web3.0的時代，用戶的内容是以加密貨幣或者數字產權作爲主要的載體，是所有者的一項資產，無法被中心化平臺所剝奪。目前來看，Mirror便是這一類型的產品。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫+可有。\n\n## 爲什麽Web3.0如此迷人？\n\n### 「創作者經濟」\n\n        首先，我們要理解一點，内容的所有權爲我們帶來的是對我們在網絡上每個行爲的定價。擧個例子，阿强創作了一張迷因圖（Meme），并且把它鑄造成了一個NFT，那這張迷因就是有價值的。（留意是價值，而非價格）在這個基礎下，這便有助於推動「創作者經濟」（creator economy）愈加蓬勃。\n\n        [根據2021年的基準報告](https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-earnings-benchmark-report/)，目前創作者經濟的市場規模已經達到了1042億美元，而對於創作者經濟領域的投資也在2021年達到了創紀錄的13億美元，這表現出了這個領域目前蓬勃的生命力。越來越多的意見領袖「KOL」透過自己的創作、想法和影響力爲自己帶來了可觀的收入。然而，儘管許多的創作者嘔心瀝血地奉獻了自己的創意，可是他們并不能獲得相應的經濟回報。[例如擁有百萬訂閱者的Youtuber平均年廣告收入只有6萬美金，而Spotify上超過700萬播放量的音樂人中，只有0.2%的人每年版稅收入超過5萬美元](https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022)，可見創作者的大部分收入都被平臺和廣告商所蠶食，這並不是一個創作者，或是創作者的支持者所願意看到的。\n\n        而在Web3.0的時代，創作者將不再是一個平臺的產品，他們可以作爲一個獨立的經濟體而存在。在Web3.0的時代，創作者們可以透過發佈NFT和社交代幣從而建立自己的粉絲社區，讓創作者可以透過除了廣告以外的方式把自己的流量變現。同時，支持者們同樣享受著隨著社區日益發展而帶來的經濟收益，形成社區蓬勃發展→創作者與支持者共同盈利→創作者獲得越來越多支持者的正向循環。同時，代幣跨越平臺與國家的屬性也為創作者提供了真正的全球市場。正如[Commsor 創始人 Mac Reddin](http://theteaguns/)所說：「創作者不需要統治世界，他們只需要一個擁有強大社區的小眾市場。創作者也有能力嘗試更多新事物，因此我們看到創作者空間中出現了有趣的社區，包括 NFT、社交資金、新平台等。」簡單來説，就是將創作者視爲一家公司，而支持者們都是他的股東。\n\n![Web3.0的相關應用（資料來源：https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jNaGFpk-hOqSw1urQT92X.avif?height=675&width=1200&size=medium)\n\n        從另一個角度看，Web3.0同時也讓每個創作者的輸出都可以轉換為他的經濟來源。比如一個網絡小說家可以透過賣他的小說，將其文章的初稿作為NFT販賣，讓熱愛他文章的讀者可以購買收藏。同時作者還可以從NFT的每次交易中抽取一定比例的交易稅，讓每個創作者都可以透過創作養活自己。\n\n### 「還權於民」\n\n        Web3.0更加吸引我的，在其「還權於民」的思想。\n\n        在傳統的Web2.0時代，中心化的機構掌握著絕對的權力，他們掌管著我們每一個用戶的數據，這使得推特、Facebook、阿里巴巴和微博這樣的公司權力得以無限膨脹。他們可以肆意的瀏覽用戶的隱私、將數據歸爲己有以此謀利，甚至還可以透過這些數據操縱群衆的思想。這樣説起來似乎很誇張，但卻也是我們無可否認的事實。大平臺可以透過各類算法給我們喜歡看的内容，同時，他們也可以決定讓我們看到什麽。近年Facebook泄露用戶信息以及被指利用社交媒體操縱選舉的指控也將其被推上輿論的風口浪尖；特朗普多次被推特禁言一事也促使了他開辦自己的社交平臺。\n\n        `「我們看似是自由的，卻只能看見那些他們想讓我們看到的，」`\n\n        加密與Web3.0的精神在於自由和自主。在Web3.0的世界，每個用戶都掌控著自己的數據，讓數據的權力不再只限於機構與國家，而是歸還予每個人，而尊重個體的利益，任何的平臺不得在未經授權的情況下使用或者篡改用戶的數據，這就是Web3.0的核心精神。而我相信，人類的進程是向自由和自主發展的，而非獨裁和專制。\n\n## Z世代所面臨的問題\n\n        回到主題，爲什麽要說Web3.0是Z世代的救贖？首先，我們要知我們Z世代到底在面臨著什麽。當我們從小學讀到中學，努力考上大學，再辛苦點的讀個Master、PHD，然後出到社會發現，原來這個社會的資源劃分已經早早的結束了，社會階級已經形成了固化。認命的，打份牛工，朝九晚八，然後發現到月底錢又沒了。節省點的，每個月存一點，沒有娛樂、沒有享受，一點一點地存錢買了套房子，房產證到手，半輩子沒了。不信命的，滿腔熱血地跑去創業，發現無論哪個行業競爭都大，自己卻沒經驗沒人脈，白白地葬送青春。不幸地，當我們從踏出學校門口那一瞬間，畢業就變成了失業。在中國，[今年畢業規模首超千萬](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-61632336)，16-24歲的失業率也達到了驚人的18.2%，即幾乎每五個16-24歲數的年輕人中就有一個人處於沒有工作的狀態，而即使放眼全世界，我們似乎都在面臨著同一個難題。\n\n##

Z世代所面臨的問題\n\n回到主題，爲什麽要說Web3.0是Z世代的救贖？首先，我們要知我們Z世代到底在面臨著什麽。當我們從小學讀到中學，努力考上大學，再辛苦點的讀個Master、PHD，然後出到社會發現，原來這個社會的資源劃分已經早早的結束了，社會階級已經形成了固化。認命的，打份牛工，朝九晚八，然後發現到月底錢又沒了。節省點的，每個月存一點，沒有娛樂、沒有享受，一點一點地存錢買了套房子，房產證到手，半輩子沒了。不信命的，滿腔熱血地跑去創業，發現無論哪個行業競爭都大，自己卻沒經驗沒人脈，白白地葬送青春。不幸地，當我們從踏出學校門口那一瞬間，畢業就變成了失業。在中國，[今年畢業規模首超千萬](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-61632336)，16-24歲的失業率也達到了驚人的18.2%，即幾乎每五個16-24歲數的年輕人中就有一個人處於沒有工作的狀態，而即使放眼全世界，我們似乎都在面臨著同一個難題。\n\n## 爲什麽Z世代與Web3.0如此契合？\n\n然而，我們似乎與Web3.0有著完美的契合度。我們從小便在網絡世界中長大，對於新事物的理解與接受都有著很强的包容程度。而在香港，我們這一代人對於自由、良知與公義有著堅定的追求，我們追求個人權力的自主，討厭極權與專制，我們有著驚人的創意與創造力，這與Web3.0有著天然的契合。\n\n而作爲一個Z世代，我們也厭倦了朝九晚八這種機械式的生活，我們渴望能夠有著靈活的上班時間，我們也渴望能在任何地方工作；我們并不討厭工作，卻討厭被束縛，我們渴望對自己的日常行程有著絕對的自主權；我們覺得自己的靈魂是有價值的，我們有著我們所熱愛的事情，我們在乎麵包，可也希望能夠做著喜歡的事情來賺取我們的麵包；我們有壓力，卻也渴望快樂，我們希望兩者能夠平衡，而不是用著僅有的快樂來抗住如山的壓力。也正因爲如此，大多數的「我們」，[不再想成爲律師、醫生或者銀行家](https://www.antler.co/blog/the-creator-economy-boom-what-it-is-whats-driving)，而是，作爲一個創作者昂然踏足在自己的人生道路上，也正因如此，Web3.0才如此適合我們。\n\n過去的一年裏，我常常流連於許多NFT社區，發現炒NFT的許多人都是與我年齡相若的年輕人，他們很懂得社區與文化的價值，這也是很多玩Defi的old money（相對的）所不理解的。Z世代對於文化的創造和理解是很擅長的，一群志趣相投的Z世代聚在一起很快就可以形成一股Vibe，同時我們也很容易被一些有趣的Vibe所感染，像是Mfer就傳達出一種「我就爛」的Vibe就特別觸動我，而像是BAYC這種龍頭項目也讓人感到Flexing的感覺。而NFT作爲Web3.0社區與文化的催化劑，每一個NFT都能代表著社區的生命力和創造力，而Z世代們對此的嗅覺便像是與生俱來的。\n\n## Web3.0目前的困境\n\n### Web2.0與Web3.0\n\n「但Web3.0必然是我們這一代人的答案嗎？」「不是必然。」以目前來講，Web3.0還有許多的問題需要我們去探討以及解決。首先第一個問題我想引用漢陽老師在[《Web 3 批评的对与错：一次讨论》](https://masterpa.mirror.xyz/RYr8_XToc5UvC6iB6pj7zp39MRA00ZvHD05m5giddIM)這篇文章中的一段話。\n\n> Web 3 的几乎所有论点，都是伴随着对 Web 2.0 的某个批评而生的。Web 2.0 不保护隐私，Web 3 就保护；Web 2.0 不给创作者分成，Web 3 就给；Web 2.0 不能让用户共享平台收益，Web 3 就发 Token 一起投票。Web 3 不一定是一个更好的互联网，它目前是一个反对 Web 2.0 的互联网。\n\n目前的Web3.0對Web2.0存在一個内在的依附性，每每論及Web3.0似乎都無法脫離Web2.0來進行論述，支持Web3.0的論點似乎全然是建基於反對Web2.0之上的，而卻沒有一個普遍認同的觀點能讓Web3.0能夠獨立成型，説服大衆它就是「最好的互聯網」。這也是所有Web3.0的擁護者需要面對的一個問題，離開了Web2.0，Web3.0還剩下什麽？這也是我們所需要思考的。\n\n### 炒作周期\n\n2020-2021年對於加密貨幣市場來説是瘋狂的一年，在這期間，比特幣從1萬多上漲到了6萬9，各式各樣的加密貨幣概念滿天飛，gamefi、defi、元宇宙、Web3.0，塑造了無數個造富神話，正如Charlie Munger所說：「[我們正處於一個比互聯網時代更瘋狂的時代](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/12/03/berkshires-munger-says-now-even-crazier-than-dot-com-bust/?slreturn=20211106151609)」。然而，截至今日（2022/6/4），比特幣已經從高位下跌超過五成，各類Altcoin也早已跌得不成人形，大浪退去，幾乎沒有一個人穿著褲子。這時候我們才發現，原來所有的概念都是空中樓閣，經不起考驗。\n\n目前來看，Web3.0似乎還沒有爲這個世界留下實質性的應用，連Stepn這種被譽為開創性的應用似乎也無法在熊市的大環境下繼續生存，那些反對加密貨幣的群體又可以再次高呼「區塊鏈騙局」的口號，但這是否代表著Web3.0將會是再一個龐氏騙局呢？經濟學家Carlota Perez在《*[技术革命与金融资本](https://www.amazon.com/Technological-Revolutions-Financial-Capital-Dynamics/dp/1843763311)*》一書中提到了一個觀點：在過去幾百年的每一次重大工業變革，都伴隨著泡沫，而隨著這些投機泡沫的破裂，那些留下來的技術，也會逐漸發展成熟，融入我們的生活當中，從而完成技術革命，例如第一次工業革命爲我們帶來了運河和道路網絡，第二次工業革命爲我們帶來了鐵路、港口和郵政，第三次工業革命則是電力和配電網絡，石油時代爲我們提供了公路與機場，互聯網時代讓電信通訊與互聯網徹底地融入了我們的生活。\n\n值得一提的是，Carlota Perez認爲「真正的技術革命必須伴隨著大量基礎設施的發展」，因此，我們不應該把全部的目光投放在那些像是Axie、Stepn或是Sandbox這樣的應用層上，而是應該留意Ethereum、Solana這樣的公鏈，或是Arweave、Metamask這類的基礎建設的發展，這些項目才是奠定Web3.0的基礎。要知道，在互聯網泡沫破滅之前，我們并沒有Google Map、沒有Youtube、沒有Instagram、也沒有Tiktok。即使它們在當時並不存在，但卻不阻礙以幹綫技術、數據服務設施以及用戶設施所組成的互聯網推動了世界，改變了我們的生活。或許我們也不需要用我們目前的認知去預測未來Web3.0的樣子，將Web2.0的應用對標到Web3.0上，想象一個Web3.0的Instagram或者是一個Web3.0的Tiktok是沒有意義的。一個真正能夠改變世界的Web3.0應用不需要取代Web2.0的任何一個誰，它將會一款是開創性的、顛覆我們認知的產品，將每個人的生活變得更好。而我們需要做的，便是觀察、等待，伺機乘上這股時代的潮流。\n\n###

{"id": "qmp6Vtip15adEVo6Mb7HMyUwcZB751R5I-3p5ObOJS0", "title": "Web3.0是否Z世代的救贖？", "body": "## 引言\n\n當代的年輕人是很悲情的一代。讀著似乎永遠讀不完的書，考著一個接一個的試。比分數、鬥Intern，也仿佛成爲了我們從出生便刻在骨子裏的軍備競賽。出了社會，也發現蛋糕早已被分得所剩無幾，我們如行尸走肉般走在被規劃好的路綫上，沒有人關心我們所想要的是什麽。「有辦法讓我們衝出這樣的桎梏嗎？」\n\n「有，Web3.0。」\n\n## 什麽是Web3.0？\n\n提起Web3.0，或許我們首先要去認識什麽是Web3.0，説到這裏，我們就有必要對Web1.0 – Web2.0的時代做一個簡單的回顧。\n\n在Web1.0時代，大部分的用戶只能作爲内容（content）的消費者，而内容的生產者大多為職業或者是專業的内容生產者，例如AOL或者是早年的雅虎門戶就屬於這一類型的產品。這個階段的互聯網主要特徵是：可讀。\n\n到了Web2.0時代，隨著越來越多人開始關注互聯網，也讓一些靠著互聯網建立影響力的人崛起（KOL），互聯網的用戶也從只閲讀内容的消費者，漸漸地轉變成爲了既可閲讀也可生產的「生產消費者」（Prosumer），如Youtube、Instagram或Tiktok這一類型的產品就屬於Web2.0的應用。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫。\n\n到了2008年，自一位化名為中本聰的人發表了《比特幣白皮書》後，Web3.0的概念也漸漸進入了人們的視野。在這個階段，互聯網的用戶不僅可以閲讀、生產内容，甚至可以成爲内容的擁有者（Owner）。也就是說，以往的内容所有權是被平臺所掌控的，一旦平臺消失或者刪除某個用戶的内容，用戶便會因此遭受損失。而在Web3.0的時代，用戶的内容是以加密貨幣或者數字產權作爲主要的載體，是所有者的一項資產，無法被中心化平臺所剝奪。目前來看，Mirror便是這一類型的產品。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫+可有。\n\n## 爲什麽Web3.0如此迷人？\n\n### 「創作者經濟」\n\n首先，我們要理解一點，内容的所有權爲我們帶來的是對我們在網絡上每個行爲的定價。擧個例子，阿强創作了一張迷因圖（Meme），并且把它鑄造成了一個NFT，那這張迷因就是有價值的。（留意是價值，而非價格）在這個基礎下，這便有助於推動「創作者經濟」（creator economy）愈加蓬勃。\n\n[根據2021年的基準報告](https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-earnings-benchmark-report/)，目前創作者經濟的市場規模已經達到了1042億美元，而對於創作者經濟領域的投資也在2021年達到了創紀錄的13億美元，這表現出了這個領域目前蓬勃的生命力。越來越多的意見領袖「KOL」透過自己的創作、想法和影響力爲自己帶來了可觀的收入。然而，儘管許多的創作者嘔心瀝血地奉獻了自己的創意，可是他們并不能獲得相應的經濟回報。[例如擁有百萬訂閱者的Youtuber平均年廣告收入只有6萬美金，而Spotify上超過700萬播放量的音樂人中，只有0.2%的人每年版稅收入超過5萬美元](https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022)，可見創作者的大部分收入都被平臺和廣告商所蠶食，這並不是一個創作者，或是創作者的支持者所願意看到的。\n\n而在Web3.0的時代，創作者將不再是一個平臺的產品，他們可以作爲一個獨立的經濟體而存在。在Web3.0的時代，創作者們可以透過發佈NFT和社交代幣從而建立自己的粉絲社區，讓創作者可以透過除了廣告以外的方式把自己的流量變現。同時，支持者們同樣享受著隨著社區日益發展而帶來的經濟收益，形成社區蓬勃發展→創作者與支持者共同盈利→創作者獲得越來越多支持者的正向循環。同時，代幣跨越平臺與國家的屬性也為創作者提供了真正的全球市場。正如[Commsor 創始人 Mac Reddin](http://theteaguns/)所說：「創作者不需要統治世界，他們只需要一個擁有強大社區的小眾市場。創作者也有能力嘗試更多新事物，因此我們看到創作者空間中出現了有趣的社區，包括 NFT、社交資金、新平台等。」簡單來説，就是將創作者視爲一家公司，而支持者們都是他的股東。\n\n![Web3.0的相關應用（資料來源：https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Uh44JA0k6zK03ft8Gopw.avif?height=675&width=1200&size=large)\n\n從另一個角度看，Web3.0同時也讓每個創作者的輸出都可以轉換為他的經濟來源。比如一個網絡小說家可以透過賣他的小說，將其文章的初稿作為NFT販賣，讓熱愛他文章的讀者可以購買收藏。同時作者還可以從NFT的每次交易中抽取一定比例的交易稅，讓每個創作者都可以透過創作養活自己。\n\n###

I want to build.” \n  \n These words echo what we have heard in many interviews over the last several months. And they resemble the experience of many of us in helping to found and foster open source projects back in our web2 days. Despite the ever-growing number of projects that help in DAO formation and management and the success of projects like GitCoin and SeedCamp, builders are not yet founding web3 projects at anything close to the pace we all would like to see.  \n\nHere are a few statistics about the relative scale of web3 - so far:\n\n* 2021 was a year of crypto and web3 hype - and yet according to data from Crunchbase, only 5% of venture deals were in the web3 space.  \n* Deep Dao as of May 2022, only lists 91 DAOs with over $1 million assets under management - and approximately 50% of the total AUM is concentrated in only three DAOs.  \n* As pointed out by A16Z in their recent state of crypto report, the AUM of all of DeFi would rank as the 31st largest bank in the United States.\n* On average there were just over 15,000 businesses receiving an employer ID number just in the United States each day. These are employers that are likely to actually employ someone as opposed to S corps which are individual companies - there are many more of these.  By comparison there are only 4,834 projects listed on DeepDao.  \n\nThere are 3x more “normie companies” founded in the US in a day than there are DAOs in existence.  \n\nWe have a long, long way to go for web3 to become the favored home of founders and especially of those that are technology-focused.  \n Here are some of the DAO founder pain points that we are building to solve:\n\n* Diversification: \n  * “My DAO contributors - and investors - have their fingers in many pies.  I’m all-in over here at this DAO.  What happens to me and my co-founders if it only does ok?” \n  * “We wanted to diversify our treasury but a) liquidity remains low so sales crush the price and b) the token holders are short-term focused, they want ‘token go up….So they shoot down our proposals and push us to hype more and HUDL HUDL HUDL.”\n* Loneliness:\n  * We all have imposter syndrome.  And we all have experienced, some of us more than others, gaslighting by investors and others who would profit if only you saw the world their way and acquiesced to their strategies. While web3 vibes are generally positive and welcoming, founders told us that there are few safe places to talk about DAO growth and challenges with others that are at a similar stage in their founding journey.  \n* Power law and the very few chances founders have to win:\n  * Those of us that think in terms of economics and finance are all too aware of the power-law nature of returns in traditional venture capital.  It turns out that all of the returns to venture capital investors are contributed by the top several percent of companies. Returns to founders are even more skewed, meaning the vast majority of founders would have been better off if they had taken a reasonably well-paying job. \n  * If each start-up takes 4-5 years for a committed founder, they may only have 4-5 potential start-ups in their life.

Dentre as principais estão:\n  * **Deposit APY:** incentivos pagos aos que depositarem seus FOX na *pool.* Esse APY representa somente uma parte das recompensas, não considerando os incentivos adicionais distribuidos aos *stakers.*\n  * **Stable Borrowing:** custo para emprestar FOX com taxa pré-fixada\n  * **Variable Borrowing:** custo para emprestar FOX a taxas variáveis conforme a demanda do token.\n  * **Maximum LTV:** porcentagem máxima que você poderá emprestar de FOX com seu depósito na Agave.\n  * **Liquidity Threshold:** porcentagem que poderá causar sua liquidação na Agave\n  * **Liquidity Penalty:** penalidade cobrada, caso ocorra a liquidação\n  * **Health Factor:** saúde do seu empréstimo. **Quanto mais próximo de 1, maior será o risco de liquidação no protocolo.**\n* Compreendidos estes conceitos, vá até **Deposit.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2MCaUZoEsXZdhJgSWlDYT.png?height=797&width=1641)\n\n* Insira a quantidade de FOX que você deseja depositar na *pool* da Agave e clique em **Continue**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2KhFtsud_yCXKgxbcJzI3.png?height=771&width=1645)\n\n* Aprove a interação do contrato inteligente da Agave Finance com a sua *wallet,* clicando em **Approve**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ab3z5C3MxmQMDEhnkgSqa.png?height=771&width=1643)\n\n* Vá até **Deposit** para aprovar o depósito dos FOXs na *pool.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bq0XObGdNNinTo1kp_ugd.png?height=770&width=1646)\n\nFinalizadas todas as etapas, seus FOXs já estarão em *stake* na Agave Finance e **você receberá \\~43% APY !**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IB4vsXBxTHkNlQRE0yZ8r.png?height=723&width=1684)\n\nApós realizar o depósito, você poderá acessar o painel de controle da Agave. Nele, é possível gerenciar suas posições no protocolo de empréstimo e resgatar as recompensas recebidas com o *stake* dos tokens. Para isso, clique em **Claim,** no canto superior direto da tela.\n\nApesar de as recompensas obtidas com seus FOX já serem muito atrativas, há diferentes estratégias que você pode adotar para maximizá-las.\n\n**Mostraremos a você algumas delas 😉**\n\n## 🏆 Estratégias Para Maximizar Incentivos\n\nO uso de protocolos de empréstimo para aumentar as recompensas recebidas com *yield farming* é uma prática comum entre os mais degenerados em DeFi. O segredo é conseguir estruturar uma estratégia compatível com seu perfil.\n\nA principal maneira de maximizar os incentivos distribuídos pelo protocolo é *realizando reiterados depósitos e empréstimos numa pool*. Para você entender melhor como isso funciona, vamos tomar como exemplo a *pool* de FOX e a de USDC na Agave Finance.\n\nQuando depositamos nossos FOX, podemos emprestar uma porcentagem de qualquer um dos tokens disponíveis na aba **Market** do protocolo de empréstimo.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O5mhVOJnSIoIqkNmPH9GP.png?height=853&width=1645)\n\nObserve que o custo para realizar um empréstimo de FOX é menor que as recompensas obtidas com o depósito do token. Deste modo, as circunstâncias possibilitam você **realizar um *loop* entre depósitos e empréstimos.** Realizando essa estratégia, você não correrá o risco de ser liquidado, já que está usando um único ativo para depositar e emprestar.\n\nUma estratégia mais arriscada é depositar FOX e emprestar outras criptomoedas com juros menores, otimizando seus ganhos ao diminuir o custo do empréstimo: para emprestar USDC o juros a.a. é de 1.8%, enquanto no FOX é 39% a.a. Essa é a magia dos protocolos de empréstimo 🚀\n\nDeste modo, você pode optar por depositar seus FOX, emprestar USDC, convertê-lo para FOX na Honeyswap, fazer um novo depósito de FOX na *pool* da Agave e **seguir esse *loop* quantas vezes forem possíveis.** Lembre-se, que você pode emprestar **até 55% do depósito de FOX na Agave Finance.**\n\nFazendo isso, você consegue maximizar seus ganhos, ao aumentar sua posição em FOX, mas expõe-se ao risco da liquidação ao emprestar USDC. Por isso, essa estratégia deve ser usada com cautela pelos *degens.* Caso a adote, **monitore constantemente no painel de controle a saúde do seu empréstimo.**\n\nSeja emprestando FOX ou USDC, a Agave Finance provê ferramentas para você conseguir ir além dos 43% de APY pagos a você por depositar seus FOX no protocolo.\n\n**A magia da composibilidade e a liberdade de realizar operações como essa sem KYC é uma experiência somente possível no universo das Finanças Descentralizadas.**\n\nEste foi o Laboratório DeFi da semana, lhe ensinando mais uma maneira de receber recompensas com seus FOX e mostrando estratégias para maximizar seus lucros através da Agave Finance.\n\nTem dúvidas sobre os parâmetros dos empréstimos?

It seems like a way of doing a weekly group-check in. \n\nPros (my personal opinion) \n\n* it is nice to catch up, seeing real faces and talking with colleagues is just great. \n* It is enlightening to get an idea of what is going on on a CU-level, and\n* it is interesting to hear what everyone is working on.\n\nCons (my personal opinion - I have to be very careful here 😅)\n\n* If the lightning round is used as an accountability instrument, it is in my opinion not very well suited for that purpose. If a person attending the meeting is currently not that busy, this person risks putting him or herself at stake, and will risk looking redundant to the team/leader - this makes everyone want to sound busy and express why they are working on the most important thing in the World. I have to stress, that this is a very general assessment I make here, and it was not the case for any of the participants in this meeting! \n\nI have participated in similar meetings for years as an attorney and as a regulator, and I will probably end up introducing it in the CU I will be facilitating as well - I wonder if there is a better alternative?\n\n**My work today**\n\nI went through the DAO Resilience Improvement Strategic Initiative.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8)\n\nIt resonates with my view on prioritization, identifying the critical path is so important.\n\nI share the opinion that this must be done by starting out with the problems, risks, and challenges and working out solutions from there.\n\nAs I understand it from Wouter and Retro, the problems must be identified from forum posts, MIPs, Discord chats, etc. Getting an aggregated overview, grouping problems, etc. sounds like a great start.\n\nHowever, I also believe the person who will later be trying to solve the problem has to enter into a conversation with the people behind the forum posts before being able to actually understand the problem.\n\nI find Clayton M Christensen’s book Competing Against Luck comprehensive on how this kind of conversation/analysis can be conducted. \n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612](https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612)\n\nI know it’s easier said than done. And it would take a lot of time.\n\nIf an aggregated problem scoreboard is being built, my suggestion is to make sure the discord handle, email address, and name are always referred to, so the people behind the initial post can be identified and reached out in case of a conversation is needed at a later stage.\n\n**Thanks so much for the feedback!**\n\nI had some great feedback on my two first posts. This made me make some changes to the posts - thanks so much for helping me out 🙌", "timestamp": 1654291556, "digest": "69XObruzm8T8UfArADGp2Y78AkSOxMpt8B2EixT1kCE", "contributor": "0x3E842E7e894d589aF537682669A8A3574e0a932C"}
{"id": "6-_zkRYUlvLNfO5xz8gTC050kciKGX_psDDFjYu_EQU", "title": "Asymptote: a tale of eternity.", "body": "A long time ago, there was a being that traveled through the space from pole to pole, even knowing that it was infinite. Her name was Asymptote. Her life was an eternal search, because it was based on finding the guides of what she believed was the most important thing in her existence.\n\nOne day, when she was searching between Andromeda and The Milky Way, she found something very interesting. Some sidereal beings that were prowling through the space were returning from what was known as an Axis. They explained to Asymptote that this axis was a very important element for understanding the Universe, which would be discovered much later by beings called humans. The representation of that element was only seen by those who had an incredible ability to question its existence. And, as it was not for wonder, Asymptote lived her life on that questioning.\n\nAsymptote was dazzled by that discovery. The sidereal beings explained to her that that drawn Axis had been an imaginary projection of the Universe. They warned Asymptote that the Designer of the Universe had not defined if it would ever have an established purpose, so that they only appeared when He arranged for them to carry out some maintenance work on that axis. Asymptote without any hint of doubt, she hastened to answer that, since she was infinite in the Universe, she would begin the search for that end not determined by that lazy Designer. The sidereal beings only exchanged glances and drew a knowing smile.\n\nWithout further setbacks Asymptote began to sail towards the axis that was drawn very close from that astral point. Her smile was huge, she had never met anyone else like her. Someone infinite. Of course, she was forbidden to go to the end of the Universe. When the Designer of the Universe created her, she had outright forbidden it, because if she did not comply with that mandate, that Designer would put an end without discussion to her eternity. But Axis was different, it was only a few light years away, from her perspective. Little by little, Asymptote began to accelerate. Her speed increased as her emotions did. She was about to hit the speed of light, and suddenly, she almost crashed into a pair of planets that were orbiting a nearby solar system. She made up her mind to be more careful, though she didn't expect to slow down the speed she had achieved. Her smile resembled a rainbow that she had known when she crossed near a place called Earth.\n\nAsymptote was getting closer and closer to that axis. In a desperate move to get closer and faster, she made a quantum leap, leaving a wormhole in her wake. In her moments of despair, and due to her immense inner energy capacity, Asymptote had left behind her millions of wormholes throughout the Universe, which, with a little patience, can be found watching carefully to infinity. At the end of that quantum leap, Asymptote felt within herself something that she had never felt, since the beginning of her existence. Her energy was consumed with immense luminous combustion, she was, wherever she passed, the most visible sidereal element from far away. Every time she saw that axis approaching, she hurried a little more each time. Three millennia had passed, which for her was but a moment. But she could not see a significant advance. Asymptote was aware that the Universe was gigantic. But that seemed like a joke to her. Something infinite, like her, was unattainable. It had never happened to her.\n\nFrom that moment on, Asymptote would never stop pursuing her motive. What she believed was the destiny of her existence. From then on, Asymptote, the closer she gets to her Axis, the more she tends to the infinity of the Universe. Legend has it that if you see a comet in the night sky, it is Asymptote still desperately seeking to reach her Axis. Her destiny.\n\n> The End\n\n### Here is Asymptote looking for Axis through the eternity of the space.\n\n[edition://0xdA2C3deC213BCD250Db741A9Fb712896ce87fc25?editionId=0](edition://0xdA2C3deC213BCD250Db741A9Fb712896ce87fc25?editionId=0)\n\n## You can see what Asymptote is all about here:\n\n**Official project site**\n\n[https://lagrandisima.com/asymptote](https://lagrandisima.com/asymptote)\n\nBy backing this project you are letting me know that my team and I are becoming good at something.", "timestamp": 1654292038, "digest": "MstGTPRBfm-s3XC2fR9F_MdjsQVOGsqgTJOQn1CDjHU", "contributor": "0x69fcc58B05Dcb614D90B129A7218608bC313a4F4"}

It existed for millennia, without ever being discovered and for all that duration, was entirely barren of life. Stark, alone and empty, it would go on its lonely way, minding its own business, for many millennia more, until finally, it would go the way of all solar systems Unheeded and violently subsumed into darkness. Its single sun exploding into supernova, enveloping all.\n\nUntil then, its sun glows, its planets revolve and its rightful place remains, while right next door, in a system no less wonderful, perhaps more, an intriguing and populous universe spins.\n\nInside this spinning vortex, is the unassuming world of Zoasis, whose inhabitants will muddle into many more metaverse worlds than any of them had a right to. Not for them is the time honoured, if messy tradition of evolution. Instead, Zoasis, created wholesale, is coaxed into existence purposefully. Some might speculate on its origin, investing time and coin trying to fathom why this rebellious little place was coded into existence fully formed. I suspect you know by whom, otherwise you wouldn’t be here for my narration of this lore.\n\nTake a look back to the beginning. No big bang or broken ribs here. Just one small area of Zoasis. A perfect sanctuary, luscious, verdant, beautiful. Now, look closer, at the large tree at its centre, gnarled, old, and aromatic with sweet spice-tinged with earthy undertones. Closer still, in the shadow cast by that tree, a stunning red hue plays upon the trunk. Here, you will see an enormous glowing crystal. The light locked inside shines luminously, reflecting the rays of the world’s many distant suns, refracted by its prism. Warmth emanates from its depths, touching all.\n\nA creator who gently places six eggs around the base of the crystal relies on this warmth and more, counts on the longevity of the crystal. That its continued radiance will not only incubate the beloved eggs, but also power the sanctuary within which they reside, for all eternity. The eggs bask in the glow of the crystal. Its life-giving light radiates through them, as their maker planned.\n\nIt is with lofty intentions the altruistic creator banished themselves to the oblivion of anonymity, cutting themselves loose from their enterprise. Allowing no trace of their existence and exacting no credit for their design. People may search, pretenders make claims, but the architect is neither revealed nor held to account. Unforeseen circumstances change nothing. Trusting the creation to flourish, its creator recedes graciously.\n\nFor the sake of the Zoasis, maybe I should not have been so benevolent.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1654292830, "digest": "7HxJnsmnXHoQIcK4IjR3qkCujiy0SyJJ5zlVXlEbjSg", "contributor": "0x6C2A50316F9aBa4B04dBE22267915ca750117c46"}

Such token models allow holders to lock their holdings for a set period, creating long-term alignment between stakers and the protocol while decreasing the circulating token supply. Curve proved the efficacy of the model with the veCRV model. Following the success of veCRV, Balancer [recently introduced](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/vebal-is-live-aeda1ae13e20) veBAL.\n\nIntroducing [Aura Finance](https://aura.finance/), a protocol allowing BAL stakers and Balancer liquidity providers to boost their yield potential and governance power in an easy-to-use platform.\n\nWhile Balancer will be Aura’s initial focus, the protocol has been designed to operate agnostically toward other vote-locked or vote-escrowed tokens. That’s to say, Aura can extend its influence beyond Balancer to other DeFi protocols over time. Details about Aura’s roadmap will be shared at a future date.\n\nContributors to Aura are numerous DeFi OGs, many of which were active in and familiar with the intricacies of the first era of ve tokens and the subsequent “wars” that followed. Contributors are abiding by a strict security policy that involves multiple audits. More information about security practices can be found [here](https://mirror.xyz/0x97bA9Ec4d946366c75DE81734a51740Fffa7a300/e2f98UbakDnnX7c67hmPvQP6nllKz1WYaKs8PrGq6pc).\n\n## AURA\n\nA core tenet Aura is being built upon is that of community ownership. This will be accomplished through the AURA governance token.\n\nDistribution will not be focused on private investors or advisors; in fact, no tokens are being distributed to insiders aside from protocol contributors. Instead, a sizeable portion of the initial circulating token supply has been allocated to the Balancer community, along with stakeholders in the broader DeFi space, via airdrops.\n\n1\\.3% of the total AURA supply will be distributed to stakeholders and contributors to Balancer, inclusive of BAL holders, BAL BPT stakers, and veBAL holders.\n\nThose that voted “yes” on the proposal to [whitelist Aura for Balancer’s ‘votingescrow’](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708) contracts have been awarded an additional allocation equal to 3x their voting power. Those that voted “no” or abstained from voting will receive no bonus but have still been allocated an airdrop based on the BAL locked up in veBAL.\n\nAn additional 2% has been allocated to the Balancer community treasury with a two-year vesting schedule.\n\n”Power users” of DeFi have been allocated 1.2% of the total supply has been allocated to incentivize the involvement of a wide variety of addresses that have historically operated as active and aligned actors for other protocols:\n\n* 1% of the total supply will be airdropped to vlCVX holders\n* 0.2% of the total supply will be airdropped to holders of LobsterDAO NFTs\n\nTo further decentralize governance power and to incentivize wider participation, allocations across both categories **have been power-scaled**. (In layman, smaller holders will receive more AURA per BAL, vlCVX, or LobsterDAO NFT they hold relative to ‘whale’ holders). More information about the scaling of distribution can be found [here](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/usdaura/allocation-scaling-process).\n\n### Things to note\n\n* Users with the ability to claim tokens from either tranche will be given an option to 1) lock their AURA into vlAURA, or 2) immediately unlock their tokens and pay a 30% penalty (e.g. if a user has 100 AURA to claim and they chose to immediately unlock their allocation, they will receive 80 AURA and 30 AURA will be penalized)\n* AURA that is penalized will be collected to a contract and re-distributed to community members at a later date\n* Only EOAs and Gnosis Safe multi-sigs are eligible to claim AURA\n* There is a minimum AURA claim amount: users with allocations under this minimum will be excluded from the distribution to ensure an efficient claiming process and to avoid “dead supply”\n* Users will be required to sign a module agreeing to Aura terms and conditions to claim tokens\n* The airdrop will take place three days **after** the completion of the LBP.\n* **IMPORTANT: Snapshots of eligible addresses have already been taken** with block heights in the past, to avoid gaming of these airdrop allocations\n\n## LBP\n\nAura will also be conducting a Balancer-based liquidity bootstrapping pool (LBP) to properly kickstart the protocol.\n\nPerpetual Protocol did a great post [linked here](https://blog.perp.fi/why-we-chose-to-distribute-perp-using-a-balancer-liquidity-bootstrapping-pool-aac7f1ab6181) on why it makes sense to use an LBP over other distribution mechanisms for protocol bootstrapping.\n\nIf you don’t want to read Perp’s post, in short, an LBP disincentivizes bots from hogging a majority of supply, creates natural price discovery, and allows users to obtain AURA at a price point they feel comfortable at.\n\n2% of the AURA supply will be added to the LBP. ETH will be the base pair for the bootstrapping pool.\n\n37\\.5% of the WETH liquidity sourced from the LBP will be used to fund an 80/20 AURA-ETH pool on Balancer. The remainder of the WETH liquidity (62.5%) will be allocated to the TreasuryDAO to fund bug bounties and development costs as directed by token holders.\n\nThe treasury decisions will be executed by a multi-sig consisting of key community stakeholders and respected names in DeFi.\n\nThe LBP will run for four days (96 hours) and begin in early June. Any updates to the timeline and exact details regarding the LBP will be conveyed via our social media channels, such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aurafinance) and Discord. Please beware of phishing attempts. You can bookmark/follow social channels to avoid such attempts.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nThe components of the initial token distribution laid out above only represent the first phase of Aura’s launch.\n\nFuture posts will outline the overall token distribution, along with highly-incentivized launch pools and rewards being put in place to catalyze a flywheel to incentivize further veBAL staking, governance participation, and efficient farming for the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nAura’s contributors are excited to make an impact on Balancer in a similar way to how Convex impacted and catalyzed Curve’s growth in both usage and mindshare in DeFi.\n\n\n____\n\nAhead of the AURA token and subsequent Aura protocol launch, feel free to join the conversation and take a role in our community via our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aurafinance) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/aurafinance).\n\nStay tuned for further information!\n\nSee you soon.", "timestamp": 1654294536, "digest": "pHF9FFR2sn2ZTLNh6YCyCivb0p7W_uPB5m4diS4jz58", "contributor": "0x21F0c2b5102951938481d8d8Ed8eCd97596eC915"}

{"id": "Poz6mXYuUSAi1pU29wY9Vv755TNDVgDSLHbtuER2J8o", "title": "Collectooors Lore Expansion", "body": "The year is 2069. I am watching a beautiful sunset from a floating porch 5,000 feet off the ground, and my bright-eyed granddaughter hoverboards up to join me. She is fascinated by the ancient history I’ve lived through, specifically the Great Metavolution, as we now call it. \n\n“Grandma,” she says, “tell me again how you made it out of the basement those bad guys put you in. How did you even survive without ultra-high-speed internet beamed from towers on the moon?” \n\n“Ah, right, the Faraday cage,” I murmur to her as my brain shifts focus almost five decades back, to the days of DM scams and having to pay for gas fees. The images get clearer and clearer as I remember Luna blowing up, Bored Ape Yacht Club taking the world by storm, and Index Coop putting BlackRock out of business and disrupting the financial system as we know it. \n\nIt all happened so fast. It had to be done. \n\nI tell my granddaughter, “I was 27 years old and found my tribe with people I met through an app on my phone...” \n\n“What’s a phone?” she interrupts. \n\n“Don’t worry about it, it’s all built into your glasses now,” I continue. \n\n“... we know ourselves as Collectooors. We were early and we were confident. Some people didn’t like that. Some people didn’t believe that art could be pixels; a collection of data points within a smart contract that is very much alive. Just like you and I grow, change, and mature... so can art. NFTs can evolve, be affected by their surroundings, and to a point capture the deep emotion that a Collectooor shares with the piece and its native home – the technology.” \n\nMy granddaughter’s mouth is wide open. I pause and she asks, “why did they try to stop you and the other Collectooors? Doesn’t everyone like art, and technology? A world without art and technology is like a world without ice cream and pizza!” \n\nI chuckle, “we had those good things back then too, and good things survive. That’s why the Collectooors stood strong, curating collections through the years, even during the dark times we had to stay in the shadows and continue building on our own. Why stop us? They tried, but to no avail. I think at the end of the day, we were misunderstood. People thought we were going against what society once valued for the wrong reasons – they would say ‘if you can’t touch it, it’s not real’ … ‘you’re paying for air’ … ‘I can just right click & save this.’” \n\nI gaze out to the fading golden orb that is the sun, the clouds glowing orange with pink undertones. I take a deep breath, the nostalgia overwhelming my senses in the best way possible. \n\n“Some people don’t like it when you challenge their status quo. The way things have been done, the familiar. Collectoors changed all that. We gave power to the people, to the artists, innovators. To the curators, the lovers of the intersection of art & technology. Gold mines ended up being discovered through projects the Collectooors aped into and helped introduce to the world. Some people just didn’t want to share,” I drift back into thought. Oh the opportunities I slept on, the late nights on Discord with the Collectooors. We had so much fun. \n\nMy daughter’s glasses start to ring, literally. I hear a subtle, sweet tone. Something must be ready. \n\n“Grandma!! My metaDoggo just minted a metaPup! I gotta show...” she drifts away, eagerly gets back on her hoverboard. I’m proud of my granddaughter for being kind, for valuing the beauty of technology, the power of art. She is very much a Collectooor, if you ask me.  \n\nI smile as I follow her silhouette descending back to the house. A home her grandpa and I were able to build with our bare hands thanks to some early bets we made with the Collectooors. \n\nThey said we weren’t going to make it. \n\nWell, here we are, and we’re not going anywhere. \n\nTo be continued...", "timestamp": 1654295690, "digest": "bjC3wtIgyuJd-kYcVQva3OjPu5ZAw38zm8H_E1R1xuM", "contributor": "0xa431d9aE84CcE1c1c6d28f8258B5b95bAB930210"}

**执行(Execution), 共识(Consensus), 数据可用性(Data Availability)**。单体化和模块化是相对概念，也是工程学发展的一种必然趋势。\n\n### 2.2 单体化区块链工作流程\n\n* 用户发送交易至节点\n* 节点验证交易的有效性，执行交易，状态转换，如果有效则并放入内存池进行广播，否则抛弃交易回滚状态- **执行(Execution)**\n* 节点生成区块头，从内存池中选择一组交易，排序并放入区块，生成区块体，将区块存储到本地 -

**BitTorrent**。\n\n## 4. 数据可用性(Data Availability)\n\n### 4.1 数据可用性的出现\n\n* 数据可用性最初不是问题，L1中的数据是自然可用的。但是我们现在面临着扩容的剧变，数据可用性才成为一个不可避免的话题。只有保证所有交易数据的**可访问和可下载**，L1或者轻节点才能对Rollup 上的状态进行**跟踪和重构**。\n\n### 4.2 DA是必不可少？\n\n#### 轻节点验证数据可用性困境\n\n![Path For Using Merkle Tree To Verify Tx](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ym6WUT_46t1mfgpqVjip1.jpg?height=468&width=1011)\n\n* 比特币在设计时就提出了 [SPV(Simple Payment Verification)](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Simplified_Payment_Verification) 的概念，即使不运行网络的全节点也可以使用网络的方式。这类节点称为轻节点，它们只下载区块头，不下载具体的交易数据，不会去验证交易的可用性，只保证同步的是最新的区块头，也就是**只能确保区块是有效的，对于区块内交易的可用性则是完全信任全节点的**。\n* 因为交易数据是记录为 Merkle Tree 的结构，轻节点虽然拥有验证某条交易的可用性的能力，但是对于全节点恶意隐藏或是扣留的交易数据，轻节点由于只有区块头，是很难确认具体哪条交易信息是无效的，除非下载全部交易数据，总结就是**确认交易无效容易，确认交易是否存在是困难的**。\n* 传统分片(Sharding)扩容方式中，矿工会被分配到不同的分片上处理该分片的工作。矿工需要运行该分片的全节点加上其它分片的轻节点来保证跨分片操作的能力。因为分片安全的分割性，如果某个分片的节点作恶，很容易出现上面描述的轻节点验证数据可用性困境，大大降低分片的性能与安全性。\n\n#### Rollup强依赖数据可用性保证\n\n![Rollup-centric](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1BnWsv954Hgmo8V1obtjw.png?height=1303&width=1400)\n\n* **Optimistic Rollup**\n  * 在 Optimistic Rollup 扩容方式中，运用一种称为 **Sequencer** 的高性能服务器对交易进行验证与执行，最终将交易批量打包(batch)传回L1进行储存。Sequencer 是更加中心化的节点，处理速度非常快，L1的共识层是无法跟上这样的处理速度进行共识的，所以为了防止 Sequencer 的作恶，我们先假设 Sequencer 处理的工作是有效的，然后还有一类角色负责定期从L1读取 Sequencer 提交的交易来区块的有效性，如果发现有无效交易则可以提交欺诈证明(Fraud Proof)来进行可用性挑战，如果数据最后被认定无效，则 Sequencer上的状态也会回滚至有效前。\n  * 这里的问题时，如果要验证Sequencer提交的交易的可用性，**需要先保证Sequencer提交了所有它验证过的交易，没有隐藏或是扣留等**，也就是需要保证数据的可用性，否则是无法进行欺诈证明验证的。Optimistic 和 Arbitrum 等 Rollup现在的解决方法是将所有交易发回以太坊，以太坊来进行数据可用性工作\n* **ZK Rollup**\n  * 对于 **ZK Rollup(Zk-SNARK/Zk-STARK)的 Sequencer** 来说，不存在欺诈性证明问题，在提交batch交易时还需要同时提交零知识可用性证明，只要证明是有效的，则交易一定是有效的。即便如此也还是需要将交易数据发送回L1进行记录，为了防止有一天此Rollup服务终止后，用户依然可以用L1上保存的数据恢复账户状态，避免资金在Rollup中的锁死。这个时候如果没有数据可用性保证，也就无法恢复正确的链上状态。这个也被称为Rollup链上状态持久性问题。\n\n### 4.3 DA扩容问题\n\n#### 吞吐量\n\n* **受限于底层区块大小限制**，区块大小其实是共识层和数据可用性层共同的问题。以太坊为例，区块大小的均值在 50-60kb，区块大小限制了单位区块可以包含的交易数量。Rollup 现在是将批量交易(batch)信息通过 calldata 字段进行压缩保存，其效率必然受限于单个区块可容纳交易限制。\n* **受限于底层数据可用性验证效率限制**，现在的 Rollup 例如 Optimism，数据可用性依然依赖 L1(以太坊)来进行，和单体化时期并没有区别，全节点下载所有交易，通过L1上的智能合约计算 Merkle Tree 等方式来验证区块内所有交易的可用性，然后进行本地保存，网络中所有节点都需要重复这个步骤。以太坊的TPS在14左右，数据可用性验证也差不多是这个速率，可见数据可用性验证的效率对Rollup效率影响之大。\n\n#### 存储成本\n\n![L2Fees.info](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SA8YxI6VmFutgXGZEdRmQ.png?height=722&width=895)\n\n* **受限于底层存储成本限制**，因为存储的高昂费用，使得用户最敏感的交易费用在L2上并没有得到大幅度的减少。现在Rollup的费率主要由固定成本与可变成本两部分组成。其中对于Rollup费率影响最大的便是calldata的存储费率16gas / byte。\n  * **固定成本**：L1 Base Tx Fee 21000 + 状态写入成本 20000\n  * **动态成本**：L2 Base Fee(可忽略不计) + calldata 写入成本(16gas / byte)\n* 数据可用性的存储和通用的存储是有区别的。数据可用性存储不会对大文件存储做优化，反而需要对数据验证做更多优化。可以看[这篇](https://0xzx.com/2022050907022285892.html)了解更多。\n\n### 4.4 DA扩容技术\n\n#### 二维R-S纠删码(2D Reed-Solomon Erasure Coding)\n\n![How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gJHd-dRFYqUdfI9KTl_Vn.png?height=730&width=624)\n\n* 纠删码是在原始数据上附加一些额外的数据，保证原始数据在一定的兀余度内的丢失都是可以通过算法恢复的，几乎所有分布式数据网络中为了保证数据的冗余性都会使用纠删码进行数据可用性保护，CD-ROM 上也大量使用纠删码来保证一定程度的物理损坏不会导致数据遗失。\n* 二维R-S纠删码是一种数据编码方式，解决的问题是**通过增加数据兀余度与采用特别的数据排列方式，帮助节点无需下载所有交易的情况下就可以快速验证数据的可用性**。全节点将数据附加纠删码后，再被切分为横纵轴数量一样的带有奇偶校验数据的数据分片，现在数据呈二维平面排列，然后计算出行和列的 Merkle Root，同时也需要用行和列的 Merkle Root 计算一个整体数据的 Merkle Root， 放入区块头信息中供之后快速校验。\n* 可以看出一个全节点如果想隐藏一笔交易，那几乎就不可能了，因为任何的修改都会导致二维数据矩阵实质性的变化，非常容易被检测出来。网络内全节点如果检测到任何数据有效性问题，也会通过数据有效性欺诈证明来快速通知轻节点。\n\n#### 数据可用性采样(Data Availability Sampling)\n\n![How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xsfy56AeSBKUS2IgY4HMi.png?height=488&width=1012)\n\n* **数据可用性采样 + 二维R-S纠删码**几乎是数据可用性项目的通用设计了，也是几个项目技术细节上有差异化的地方。以太坊的Dank Sharding也不断在进行数据可用性采样方面的研究。\n* 在交易数据完成二维R-S纠删码编码，区块头也广播之后。轻节点就可以通过区块头中的行与列的 Merkle Root 计算出整体数据的 Merkle Root 并与区块头中的数据进行对比。如果整体数据的 Merkle Root 没有问题的话，轻节点再进行一个非常小的数据采样测试。例如随机选择第3行与第5列，之后就是与 SPV 中轻节点验证交易可用性方式一样了，要求全节点返回计算需要用到的节点路径进行哈希计算。最后再与全节点给出的第3列与第5行的 Merkle State 数据做对比就完成了一次采样验证。\n* 这个方案最重要也是最美妙的一点在于，**验证数据量与计算量很小，支持大量轻节点的加入，并且节点数量越多，区块的可用性概率也越高整个网络也越安全**，对于检测数据隐藏或者扣留的情况非常高效。\n\n#### 命名空间默克尔树(Namespaced Merkle Tree)\n\n* 这个是 Celestia 首先提出的技术，简单说就是将整个默克尔状态树划分了归属，全节点做验证时只需要下载自己归属下的那部分树结构就可以了。这样的好处是可以同时支持不同的执行层数据的可用性验证。这个设计充分体现了Celestia的模块化主义与多Rollup并存的展望。技术细节可以参考[这篇文章](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Y4avtYdyES45EBkhHp07XA)。\n\n#### KZG承诺(Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg Commitment)\n\n![KZG Commitments](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1RqExMG81sUqSEAZlwU0z.png?height=532&width=1778)\n\n* 使用 KZG 作为数据可用性的状态根最来自于以太坊的 Danksharding 方案。KZG承诺的作用和 Merkle Root 一样，是对于整体状态的一种证明方式(proof of inclusion)，可以看做另一种 Merkle Root，只不过它哈希的不是数据，而是多项式。数据量更小，可用性证明更加高效，而且所有叶子节点都在同一个 polynomial(多项式)上，通过增加叶子节点就可以进行纠删码编码(Erasure Coding友好)。\n\n## 5. Danksharding\n\n![Danksharding](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oi1Pe3E5xB_7lph9DBTqE.jpg?height=623&width=1400)\n\n### 5.1 Proto-Danksharding(EIP-4844)\n\n* Proto-Danksharding 是 Danksharding 的一个早期先行版本。在交易信息中包含了一个额外的存储空间字段 - **blob**。每个blob有 128kb 空间，每个交易最多有两个blob，每个区块最多包含16个blob，blob不可以被EVM执行。blob都使用 KZG 承诺进行多项式哈希，用于之后的数据可用性验证。之前Rollup的批处理batch数据都是通过 calldate 字段传入L1，现在可以直接放到blob中。\n* 这里最重要的是，**blob不是永久存储的，可以理解为有时效性的缓存**，每隔一段时间(30天)以太坊上的blob数据是会被清除的，通过这种缓存的方式来减轻以太坊的存储压力以及减少存储费率。因为30天后blob数据会被清理，所以需要自行存储这些历史交易数据。以太坊共识层的目的不是保证永远保存所有历史数据。相反，其目的是提供一个高度安全的实时公告板，将历史数据存储的工作交给其它更适合的网络来进行，以太坊也在全力转向模块化趋势。\n\n### 5.2 Danksharding\n\n* Danksharding 是以太坊的新分片设计提案，围绕 [Rollup-Centric](https://polynya.medium.com/understanding-ethereums-rollup-centric-roadmap-1c60d30c060f) 的以太坊发展路线，提出了很多数据可用性层相关的改进。此分片方案给 rollup 的批处理batch数据提供大量的存储空间 blob。以太坊协议本身并不试图解译这些blob，验证一个 blob 只需要检查该 blob 是否可用——即它能否从网络上下载。这些 blob 的数据空间预期是为支持高吞吐量交易的二层 rollup 协议所用的。\n* Danksharding 将 Proto-Danksharding 中blob数量提升了**16倍**，最大交易大小从2M上升到32M, 目标交易大小从1M提升到16M。blobs 分散存储在 Becon Chain 上，单独作为数据可用性层工作。依然是运用纠删码技术，每个节点只保存blob的数据片段，整个网络来保证blob的数据的完整性(和 BitTorrent 一样)。blob使用数据可用性采样(DAS)的方式配合 KZG 状态根来验证数据可用性，提交提交 attestation，attestation 达到阈值则认为block有效。再配合 EIP-4488 来减少 calldata 的存储费用，包括提供独立的数据有效性分片来存储blob，可以说是在数据可用性扩容上全力导向 Rollup-Centric 发展路线了。\n\n## 6. Celestia\n\n![Celestia Modular Stack](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q4VEiP_O99VAmCx5p8l6S.png?height=614&width=1008)\n\n* Celestia 是近期最重要的模块化区块链项目，也是推进数据可用性与模块化区块链落地的先驱。构建于 CosmosSDK 之上，专注于提供数据可用性服务，不执行任何交易。他们率先提出了让轻节点使用二维R-S纠删码进行数据可用性验证，同时开发了命名空间默克尔树来支持多种 Rollup，也提出了量子引力桥(Quantum Gravity Bridge)使用 Celestia 作为以太坊数据可用性层的扩容方案。\n* CEO Mustafa Al-Bassam是 Chainspace 的 Co-Funder，这个项目后来被 Facebook 收购。首席研究员 John Adler 来自 ConsenSys,曾经帮助 Optimism 完成了第一版技术规范。\n* **我觉得模块化在社区的兴起大部分是因为Celestia描述了一种全新的模块化区块链技术栈，其中以Rollup + Cevmos + Celestia的组合受到最多关注。Cevmos是Celestia与Evmos团队合作推出的模块化结算层，使用Optimint(Optimistic Tendermint)共识, 基本是完全为EVM Rollup优化的，还结合了Cosmos网络的互操作性，组合性等优势，十分值得期待。**\n\n## 7. Polygon Avail\n\n![Layer2 Aggregator](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ClWOt5fETUXlFq10Y3-fU.jpg?height=1039&width=1080)\n\n* 谈到L2怎么能少了号称layer2聚合器的Polygon。Avail是Celestia的竞品，作为polygon的layer2聚合器版图的一部份，构建于Substrate之上，专注于数据可用性层的服务。**在我看Avail也是最有可能在Polkadot生态出现原生的数据有效层项目前的DA选择方案之一。Celestia已经为Cosmos生态描绘出一种极高灵活度与扩展性的架构，我相信Substrate生态也会不甘落后的。**\n* Avail 的思路与 Celestia 基本相同，区别主要在于纠删码的生成以及采样验证环节。Avail 在二维R-S纠删码编码阶段大量使用KZG承诺。Avail将数据展开为n \\* m的矩阵，对每一行都构造一个多项式，然后为每一个多项式都生成一个 KZG 承诺放入区块头。之后轻节点便只需要原始数据和 KZG 承诺便可完成可用性验证。\n\n![Introducing Avail by Polygon — a Robust General-Purpose Scalable Data Availability Layer — Polygon | Blog](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9aQ9_KDQYvuP7mOD2oLKx.png?height=465&width=800)\n\n## 8.

**BitTorrent**。\n\n## 4. 数据可用性(Data Availability)\n\n### 4.1 数据可用性的出现\n\n* 数据可用性最初不是问题，L1中的数据是自然可用的。但是我们现在面临着扩容的剧变，数据可用性才成为一个不可避免的话题。只有保证所有交易数据的**可访问和可下载**，L1或者轻节点才能对Rollup 上的状态进行**跟踪和重构**。\n\n### 4.2 DA是必不可少？\n\n#### 轻节点验证数据可用性困境\n\n![Path For Using Merkle Tree To Verify Tx](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ym6WUT_46t1mfgpqVjip1.jpg?height=468&width=1011)\n\n* 比特币在设计时就提出了 [SPV(Simple Payment Verification)](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Simplified_Payment_Verification) 的概念，即使不运行网络的全节点也可以使用网络的方式。这类节点称为轻节点，它们只下载区块头，不下载具体的交易数据，不会去验证交易的可用性，只保证同步的是最新的区块头，也就是**只能确保区块是有效的，对于区块内交易的可用性则是完全信任全节点的**。\n* 因为交易数据是记录为 Merkle Tree 的结构，轻节点虽然拥有验证某条交易的可用性的能力，但是对于全节点恶意隐藏或是扣留的交易数据，轻节点由于只有区块头，是很难确认具体哪条交易信息是无效的，除非下载全部交易数据，总结就是**确认交易无效容易，确认交易是否存在是困难的**。\n* 传统分片(Sharding)扩容方式中，矿工会被分配到不同的分片上处理该分片的工作。矿工需要运行该分片的全节点加上其它分片的轻节点来保证跨分片操作的能力。因为分片安全的分割性，如果某个分片的节点作恶，很容易出现上面描述的轻节点验证数据可用性困境，大大降低分片的性能与安全性。\n\n#### Rollup强依赖数据可用性保证\n\n![Rollup-centric](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1BnWsv954Hgmo8V1obtjw.png?height=1303&width=1400)\n\n* **Optimistic Rollup**\n  * 在 Optimistic Rollup 扩容方式中，运用一种称为 **Sequencer** 的高性能服务器对交易进行验证与执行，最终将交易批量打包(batch)传回L1进行储存。Sequencer 是更加中心化的节点，处理速度非常快，L1的共识层是无法跟上这样的处理速度进行共识的，所以为了防止 Sequencer 的作恶，我们先假设 Sequencer 处理的工作是有效的，然后还有一类角色负责定期从L1读取 Sequencer 提交的交易来区块的有效性，如果发现有无效交易则可以提交欺诈证明(Fraud Proof)来进行可用性挑战，如果数据最后被认定无效，则 Sequencer上的状态也会回滚至有效前。\n  * 这里的问题时，如果要验证Sequencer提交的交易的可用性，**需要先保证Sequencer提交了所有它验证过的交易，没有隐藏或是扣留等**，也就是需要保证数据的可用性，否则是无法进行欺诈证明验证的。Optimistic 和 Arbitrum 等 Rollup现在的解决方法是将所有交易发回以太坊，以太坊来进行数据可用性工作\n* **ZK Rollup**\n  * 对于 **ZK Rollup(Zk-SNARK/Zk-STARK)的 Sequencer** 来说，不存在欺诈性证明问题，在提交batch交易时还需要同时提交零知识可用性证明，只要证明是有效的，则交易一定是有效的。即便如此也还是需要将交易数据发送回L1进行记录，为了防止有一天此Rollup服务终止后，用户依然可以用L1上保存的数据恢复账户状态，避免资金在Rollup中的锁死。这个时候如果没有数据可用性保证，也就无法恢复正确的链上状态。这个也被称为Rollup链上状态持久性问题。\n\n### 4.3 DA扩容问题\n\n#### 吞吐量\n\n* **受限于底层区块大小限制**，区块大小其实是共识层和数据可用性层共同的问题。以太坊为例，区块大小的均值在 50-60kb，区块大小限制了单位区块可以包含的交易数量。Rollup 现在是将批量交易(batch)信息通过 calldata 字段进行压缩保存，其效率必然受限于单个区块可容纳交易限制。\n* **受限于底层数据可用性验证效率限制**，现在的 Rollup 例如 Optimism，数据可用性依然依赖 L1(以太坊)来进行，和单体化时期并没有区别，全节点下载所有交易，通过L1上的智能合约计算 Merkle Tree 等方式来验证区块内所有交易的可用性，然后进行本地保存，网络中所有节点都需要重复这个步骤。以太坊的TPS在14左右，数据可用性验证也差不多是这个速率，可见数据可用性验证的效率对Rollup效率影响之大。\n\n#### 存储成本\n\n![L2Fees.info](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SA8YxI6VmFutgXGZEdRmQ.png?height=722&width=895)\n\n* **受限于底层存储成本限制**，因为存储的高昂费用，使得用户最敏感的交易费用在L2上并没有得到大幅度的减少。现在Rollup的费率主要由固定成本与可变成本两部分组成。其中对于Rollup费率影响最大的便是calldata的存储费率16gas / byte。\n  * **固定成本**：L1 Base Tx Fee 21000 + 状态写入成本 20000\n  * **动态成本**：L2 Base Fee(可忽略不计) + calldata 写入成本(16gas / byte)\n* 数据可用性的存储和通用的存储是有区别的。数据可用性存储不会对大文件存储做优化，反而需要对数据验证做更多优化。可以看[这篇](https://0xzx.com/2022050907022285892.html)了解更多。\n\n### 4.4 DA扩容技术\n\n#### 二维R-S纠删码(2D Reed-Solomon Erasure Coding)\n\n![How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gJHd-dRFYqUdfI9KTl_Vn.png?height=730&width=624)\n\n* 纠删码是在原始数据上附加一些额外的数据，保证原始数据在一定的兀余度内的丢失都是可以通过算法恢复的，几乎所有分布式数据网络中为了保证数据的冗余性都会使用纠删码进行数据可用性保护，CD-ROM 上也大量使用纠删码来保证一定程度的物理损坏不会导致数据遗失。\n* 二维R-S纠删码是一种数据编码方式，解决的问题是**通过增加数据兀余度与采用特别的数据排列方式，帮助节点无需下载所有交易的情况下就可以快速验证数据的可用性**。全节点将数据附加纠删码后，再被切分为横纵轴数量一样的带有奇偶校验数据的数据分片，现在数据呈二维平面排列，然后计算出行和列的 Merkle Root，同时也需要用行和列的 Merkle Root 计算一个整体数据的 Merkle Root， 放入区块头信息中供之后快速校验。\n* 可以看出一个全节点如果想隐藏一笔交易，那几乎就不可能了，因为任何的修改都会导致二维数据矩阵实质性的变化，非常容易被检测出来。网络内全节点如果检测到任何数据有效性问题，也会通过数据有效性欺诈证明来快速通知轻节点。\n\n#### 数据可用性采样(Data Availability Sampling)\n\n![How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xsfy56AeSBKUS2IgY4HMi.png?height=488&width=1012)\n\n* **数据可用性采样 + 二维R-S纠删码**几乎是数据可用性项目的通用设计了，也是几个项目技术细节上有差异化的地方。以太坊的Dank Sharding也不断在进行数据可用性采样方面的研究。\n* 在交易数据完成二维R-S纠删码编码，区块头也广播之后。轻节点就可以通过区块头中的行与列的 Merkle Root 计算出整体数据的 Merkle Root 并与区块头中的数据进行对比。如果整体数据的 Merkle Root 没有问题的话，轻节点再进行一个非常小的数据采样测试。例如随机选择第3行与第5列，之后就是与 SPV 中轻节点验证交易可用性方式一样了，要求全节点返回计算需要用到的节点路径进行哈希计算。最后再与全节点给出的第3列与第5行的 Merkle State 数据做对比就完成了一次采样验证。\n* 这个方案最重要也是最美妙的一点在于，**验证数据量与计算量很小，支持大量轻节点的加入，并且节点数量越多，区块的可用性概率也越高整个网络也越安全**，对于检测数据隐藏或者扣留的情况非常高效。\n\n#### 命名空间默克尔树(Namespaced Merkle Tree)\n\n* 这个是 Celestia 首先提出的技术，简单说就是将整个默克尔状态树划分了归属，全节点做验证时只需要下载自己归属下的那部分树结构就可以了。这样的好处是可以同时支持不同的执行层数据的可用性验证。这个设计充分体现了Celestia的模块化主义与多Rollup并存的展望。技术细节可以参考[这篇文章](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Y4avtYdyES45EBkhHp07XA)。\n\n#### KZG承诺(Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg Commitment)\n\n![KZG Commitments](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1RqExMG81sUqSEAZlwU0z.png?height=532&width=1778)\n\n* 使用 KZG 作为数据可用性的状态根最来自于以太坊的 Danksharding 方案。KZG承诺的作用和 Merkle Root 一样，是对于整体状态的一种证明方式(proof of inclusion)，可以看做另一种 Merkle Root，只不过它哈希的不是数据，而是多项式。数据量更小，可用性证明更加高效，而且所有叶子节点都在同一个 polynomial(多项式)上，通过增加叶子节点就可以进行纠删码编码(Erasure Coding友好)。\n\n## 5. Danksharding\n\n![Danksharding](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oi1Pe3E5xB_7lph9DBTqE.jpg?height=623&width=1400)\n\n### 5.1 Proto-Danksharding(EIP-4844)\n\n* Proto-Danksharding 是 Danksharding 的一个早期先行版本。在交易信息中包含了一个额外的存储空间字段 - **blob**。每个blob有 128kb 空间，每个交易最多有两个blob，每个区块最多包含16个blob，blob不可以被EVM执行。blob都使用 KZG 承诺进行多项式哈希，用于之后的数据可用性验证。之前Rollup的批处理batch数据都是通过 calldate 字段传入L1，现在可以直接放到blob中。\n* 这里最重要的是，**blob不是永久存储的，可以理解为有时效性的缓存**，每隔一段时间(30天)以太坊上的blob数据是会被清除的，通过这种缓存的方式来减轻以太坊的存储压力以及减少存储费率。因为30天后blob数据会被清理，所以需要自行存储这些历史交易数据。以太坊共识层的目的不是保证永远保存所有历史数据。相反，其目的是提供一个高度安全的实时公告板，将历史数据存储的工作交给其它更适合的网络来进行，以太坊也在全力转向模块化趋势。\n\n### 5.2 Danksharding\n\n* Danksharding 是以太坊的新分片设计提案，围绕 [Rollup-Centric](https://polynya.medium.com/understanding-ethereums-rollup-centric-roadmap-1c60d30c060f) 的以太坊发展路线，提出了很多数据可用性层相关的改进。此分片方案给 rollup 的批处理batch数据提供大量的存储空间 blob。以太坊协议本身并不试图解译这些blob，验证一个 blob 只需要检查该 blob 是否可用——即它能否从网络上下载。这些 blob 的数据空间预期是为支持高吞吐量交易的二层 rollup 协议所用的。\n* Danksharding 将 Proto-Danksharding 中blob数量提升了**16倍**，最大交易大小从2M上升到32M, 目标交易大小从1M提升到16M。blobs 分散存储在 Becon Chain 上，单独作为数据可用性层工作。依然是运用纠删码技术，每个节点只保存blob的数据片段，整个网络来保证blob的数据的完整性(和 BitTorrent 一样)。blob使用数据可用性采样(DAS)的方式配合 KZG 状态根来验证数据可用性，提交提交 attestation，attestation 达到阈值则认为block有效。再配合 EIP-4488 来减少 calldata 的存储费用，包括提供独立的数据有效性分片来存储blob，可以说是在数据可用性扩容上全力导向 Rollup-Centric 发展路线了。\n\n## 6. Celestia\n\n![Celestia Modular Stack](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q4VEiP_O99VAmCx5p8l6S.png?height=614&width=1008)\n\n* Celestia 是近期最重要的模块化区块链项目，也是推进数据可用性与模块化区块链落地的先驱。构建于 CosmosSDK 之上，专注于提供数据可用性服务，不执行任何交易。他们率先提出了让轻节点使用二维R-S纠删码进行数据可用性验证，同时开发了命名空间默克尔树来支持多种 Rollup，也提出了量子引力桥(Quantum Gravity Bridge)使用 Celestia 作为以太坊数据可用性层的扩容方案。\n* CEO Mustafa Al-Bassam是 Chainspace 的 Co-Funder，这个项目后来被 Facebook 收购。首席研究员 John Adler 来自 ConsenSys,曾经帮助 Optimism 完成了第一版技术规范。\n* **我觉得模块化在社区的兴起大部分是因为Celestia描述了一种全新的模块化区块链技术栈，其中以Rollup + Cevmos + Celestia的组合受到最多关注。Cevmos是Celestia与Evmos团队合作推出的模块化结算层，使用Optimint(Optimistic Tendermint)共识, 基本是完全为EVM Rollup优化的，还结合了Cosmos网络的互操作性，组合性等优势，十分值得期待。**\n\n## 7. Polygon Avail\n\n![Layer2 Aggregator](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ClWOt5fETUXlFq10Y3-fU.jpg?height=1039&width=1080)\n\n* 谈到L2怎么能少了号称layer2聚合器的Polygon。Avail是Celestia的竞品，作为polygon的layer2聚合器版图的一部份，构建于Substrate之上，专注于数据可用性层的服务。**在我看Avail也是最有可能在Polkadot生态出现原生的数据有效层项目前的DA选择方案之一。Celestia已经为Cosmos生态描绘出一种极高灵活度与扩展性的架构，我相信Substrate生态也会不甘落后的。**\n* Avail 的思路与 Celestia 基本相同，区别主要在于纠删码的生成以及采样验证环节。Avail 在二维R-S纠删码编码阶段大量使用KZG承诺。Avail将数据展开为n \\* m的矩阵，对每一行都构造一个多项式，然后为每一个多项式都生成一个 KZG 承诺放入区块头。之后轻节点便只需要原始数据和 KZG 承诺便可完成可用性验证。\n\n![Introducing Avail by Polygon — a Robust General-Purpose Scalable Data Availability Layer — Polygon | Blog](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9aQ9_KDQYvuP7mOD2oLKx.png?height=465&width=800)\n\n## 8. Startwar Validium & ZkSync ZkPorter\n\n* Validium 和 ZkPorter 是 Zk-Rollup 两大巨头 Startware 与 ZkSync 推出的自家链下存储服务。本质是是为了解决上述L1的瓶颈舒服Rollup快速大规模应用的问题，通过将交易数据存储在为Zk交易数据优化过的相对中心化的网络中而不是以太坊来大幅降低交易费用。我觉得这是对于以太坊过于缓慢开发进度的一种折衷方案。毕竟安全性是有代价的，不过这样服务的出现肯定也能打中一批目标用户。\n\n## 9. 参考\n\n[Celestia 101 - 模块化区块链 — Yicheng (mirror.xyz)](https://mirror.xyz/yicheng.eth/7q29a3lMXkG2f51-BrTLxovS3tqnwf4qi7_VWFhnqKc)\n\n[研究｜Celestia会成为DA模块的头牌吗？ (qq.com)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Y4avtYdyES45EBkhHp07XA)\n\n[Why Do We Need Modular Blockchains For Scalability? | by Yong kang Chia | Apr, 2022 | Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-we-need-modular-blockchains-for-scalability-276f4d724b0e)\n\n[WTF is Data Availability?. and why solving the “data availability… | by Yuan Han Li | Blockchain Capital Blog | Medium](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/wtf-is-data-availability-80c2c95ded0f)\n\n[A Non-Technical Introduction to Rollups – Mechanism Capital](https://www.mechanism.capital/rollups-introduction/)\n\n[What Is Data Availability? | Alexandria (coinmarketcap.com)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-data-availability)\n\n[How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://medium.com/huobi-research/how-the-data-availability-layer-can-shape-the-future-of-blockchain-83274b64d2c)\n\n[Celestia MVP 发布：数据可用性采样轻客户端 — W3.Hitchhiker (mirror.xyz)](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/T9MoM-3p_xNIx7I5k-UzmfKqGBQaDQmdvGw4K8bFMTA)\n\n[Vitalik: Proto-Danksharding FAQ | 登链社区 | 区块链技术社区 (learnblockchain.cn)](https://learnblockchain.cn/article/3769)\n\n[基础数据结构 :: 以太坊技术与实现 (learnblockchain.cn)](https://learnblockchain.cn/books/geth/part1.html)", "timestamp": 1654296354, "digest": "2r1YXSMvy12Oy7bztVCk6Z5KKI0PyHbBkYuXClXJP34", "contributor": "0xc72F2AaaBc115AFD7D7FC3394D8e6B10B39271F1"}

**共识(Consensus), 数据可用性(DA)**\n* 网络通过自己的共识机制挑选出块节点，出块节点广播自己的本地最新区块 - **共识(Consensus)**\n* 网络内其它节点收到区块后检查本地是否已经有了，没有的话需要重新验证交易的有效性与可用性, 并将此区块存储到本地 - **执行(Execution), 数据可用性(DA)**\n* 网络内节点达成最终性(Finality)后此区块成为链上最新区块\n\n## 3. 模块化(Modular)区块链\n\n![Ethereum From Monolithic To Modular](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iNL6SWNNJaF7wm5KjG2P1.jpeg?height=737&width=1160)\n\n### 3.1 为什么要解耦单体化区块链？\n\n* 区块链作为执行[状态机复制(SMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication)的分布式网络，理论上就可以被分为数据，执行，共识等层级。单体化区块链遵循了 SMR 的设计，只是将所有层级的工作都放在了同一个节点(全节点)上执行。比特币，以太坊等项目都证实了其工程上的可行性。\n* 回到不可能三角问题，**扩容已经成了整个行业的圣杯**。从比特币开始，区块链就不是科学上的创新，而是工程学上的创新。从单体化到模块化基本是工程学的发展规律，可以看一下现在的扩容技术，基本每一种都有很强的模块化趋势，或是走在模块化的道路上，看似模块化的出现是因为现前扩容的需求，实则**模块化的出现是必然**。\n\n### 3.2 什么是模块化区块链？\n\n* 模块化区块链是按照**执行，共识/结算与数据可用性**这样的模块粒度来进行解耦的区块链设计模式，每个层级由不同的网络进行维护，各层级充分发挥自身网络特性，最后通过可拔插的组合形成流水线的工作方式。\n* **执行层**突出强大和快速的计算处理能力，抛开共识和存储的束缚，可以通过非常少量的高性能节点来完成工作。\n* **共识层**需要保证交易的公正有效与安全，选出最符合网络共识要求的区块。共识层需要满足优秀的共识性与去中心化性。Polygon做过一个比喻，当你刷信用卡的时候，你的交易记录是先存放在信用卡中心的，信用卡中心会定期将一批信用卡交易记录发给银行，银行来确认交易的可用性并对账目进行记录更改。显然你不会因为信用卡中心的确认速度更快而把钱直接存到信用卡中心，因为银行才是金融体系内负责结算的角色，它有足够的信用背书，也有足够大的体量防止被攻击。\n* **数据可用性层**需要保证数据在保存前没有被二次篡改或者隐藏扣留，确保所有需要记录的交易信息都被正确的记录，数据可用性层的要求比较综合，需要共识性与不错的储存能力。在单体化区块链中没有数据有效性问题，因为数据被节点记录之前都会重新执行验证一遍，并且会和本地存储的区块进行比对来确保数据的有效。还是用上面的例子，银行收到信用卡中心的账单列表后，虽然已经确定的记账的方式，但是也会让多个结算员来对账单进行二次检查和结算，确保信用卡中心没有对用户的账单做手脚。DA 的概念是伴随着模块化区块链产生的，但是在 web 领域，基于 DA 的产品几乎每个人都用过的 - **BitTorrent**。\n\n## 4. 数据可用性(Data Availability)\n\n### 4.1 数据可用性的出现\n\n* 数据可用性最初不是问题，L1中的数据是自然可用的。但是我们现在面临着扩容的剧变，数据可用性才成为一个不可避免的话题。只有保证所有交易数据的**可访问和可下载**，L1或者轻节点才能对Rollup 上的状态进行**跟踪和重构**。\n\n### 4.2 DA是必不可少？\n\n#### 轻节点验证数据可用性困境\n\n![Path For Using Merkle Tree To Verify Tx](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ym6WUT_46t1mfgpqVjip1.jpg?height=468&width=1011)\n\n* 比特币在设计时就提出了 [SPV(Simple Payment Verification)](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Simplified_Payment_Verification) 的概念，即使不运行网络的全节点也可以使用网络的方式。这类节点称为轻节点，它们只下载区块头，不下载具体的交易数据，不会去验证交易的可用性，只保证同步的是最新的区块头，也就是**只能确保区块是有效的，对于区块内交易的可用性则是完全信任全节点的**。\n* 因为交易数据是记录为 Merkle Tree 的结构，轻节点虽然拥有验证某条交易的可用性的能力，但是对于全节点恶意隐藏或是扣留的交易数据，轻节点由于只有区块头，是很难确认具体哪条交易信息是无效的，除非下载全部交易数据，总结就是**确认交易无效容易，确认交易是否存在是困难的**。\n* 传统分片(Sharding)扩容方式中，矿工会被分配到不同的分片上处理该分片的工作。矿工需要运行该分片的全节点加上其它分片的轻节点来保证跨分片操作的能力。因为分片安全的分割性，如果某个分片的节点作恶，很容易出现上面描述的轻节点验证数据可用性困境，大大降低分片的性能与安全性。\n\n#### Rollup强依赖数据可用性保证\n\n![Rollup-centric](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1BnWsv954Hgmo8V1obtjw.png?height=1303&width=1400)\n\n* **Optimistic Rollup**\n  * 在 Optimistic Rollup 扩容方式中，运用一种称为 **Sequencer** 的高性能服务器对交易进行验证与执行，最终将交易批量打包(batch)传回L1进行储存。Sequencer 是更加中心化的节点，处理速度非常快，L1的共识层是无法跟上这样的处理速度进行共识的，所以为了防止 Sequencer 的作恶，我们先假设 Sequencer 处理的工作是有效的，然后还有一类角色负责定期从L1读取 Sequencer 提交的交易来区块的有效性，如果发现有无效交易则可以提交欺诈证明(Fraud Proof)来进行可用性挑战，如果数据最后被认定无效，则 Sequencer上的状态也会回滚至有效前。\n  * 这里的问题时，如果要验证Sequencer提交的交易的可用性，**需要先保证Sequencer提交了所有它验证过的交易，没有隐藏或是扣留等**，也就是需要保证数据的可用性，否则是无法进行欺诈证明验证的。Optimistic 和 Arbitrum 等 Rollup现在的解决方法是将所有交易发回以太坊，以太坊来进行数据可用性工作\n* **ZK Rollup**\n  * 对于 **ZK Rollup(Zk-SNARK/Zk-STARK)的 Sequencer** 来说，不存在欺诈性证明问题，在提交batch交易时还需要同时提交零知识可用性证明，只要证明是有效的，则交易一定是有效的。即便如此也还是需要将交易数据发送回L1进行记录，为了防止有一天此Rollup服务终止后，用户依然可以用L1上保存的数据恢复账户状态，避免资金在Rollup中的锁死。这个时候如果没有数据可用性保证，也就无法恢复正确的链上状态。这个也被称为Rollup链上状态持久性问题。\n\n### 4.3 DA扩容问题\n\n#### 吞吐量\n\n* **受限于底层区块大小限制**，区块大小其实是共识层和数据可用性层共同的问题。以太坊为例，区块大小的均值在 50-60kb，区块大小限制了单位区块可以包含的交易数量。Rollup 现在是将批量交易(batch)信息通过 calldata 字段进行压缩保存，其效率必然受限于单个区块可容纳交易限制。\n* **受限于底层数据可用性验证效率限制**，现在的 Rollup 例如 Optimism，数据可用性依然依赖 L1(以太坊)来进行，和单体化时期并没有区别，全节点下载所有交易，通过L1上的智能合约计算 Merkle Tree 等方式来验证区块内所有交易的可用性，然后进行本地保存，网络中所有节点都需要重复这个步骤。以太坊的TPS在14左右，数据可用性验证也差不多是这个速率，可见数据可用性验证的效率对Rollup效率影响之大。\n\n#### 存储成本\n\n![L2Fees.info](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SA8YxI6VmFutgXGZEdRmQ.png?height=722&width=895)\n\n* **受限于底层存储成本限制**，因为存储的高昂费用，使得用户最敏感的交易费用在L2上并没有得到大幅度的减少。现在Rollup的费率主要由固定成本与可变成本两部分组成。其中对于Rollup费率影响最大的便是calldata的存储费率16gas / byte。\n  * **固定成本**：L1 Base Tx Fee 21000 + 状态写入成本 20000\n  * **动态成本**：L2 Base Fee(可忽略不计) + calldata 写入成本(16gas / byte)\n* 数据可用性的存储和通用的存储是有区别的。数据可用性存储不会对大文件存储做优化，反而需要对数据验证做更多优化。可以看[这篇](https://0xzx.com/2022050907022285892.html)了解更多。\n\n### 4.4 DA扩容技术\n\n#### 二维R-S纠删码(2D Reed-Solomon Erasure Coding)\n\n![How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gJHd-dRFYqUdfI9KTl_Vn.png?height=730&width=624)\n\n* 纠删码是在原始数据上附加一些额外的数据，保证原始数据在一定的兀余度内的丢失都是可以通过算法恢复的，几乎所有分布式数据网络中为了保证数据的冗余性都会使用纠删码进行数据可用性保护，CD-ROM 上也大量使用纠删码来保证一定程度的物理损坏不会导致数据遗失。\n* 二维R-S纠删码是一种数据编码方式，解决的问题是**通过增加数据兀余度与采用特别的数据排列方式，帮助节点无需下载所有交易的情况下就可以快速验证数据的可用性**。全节点将数据附加纠删码后，再被切分为横纵轴数量一样的带有奇偶校验数据的数据分片，现在数据呈二维平面排列，然后计算出行和列的 Merkle Root，同时也需要用行和列的 Merkle Root 计算一个整体数据的 Merkle Root， 放入区块头信息中供之后快速校验。\n* 可以看出一个全节点如果想隐藏一笔交易，那几乎就不可能了，因为任何的修改都会导致二维数据矩阵实质性的变化，非常容易被检测出来。网络内全节点如果检测到任何数据有效性问题，也会通过数据有效性欺诈证明来快速通知轻节点。\n\n#### 数据可用性采样(Data Availability Sampling)\n\n![How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xsfy56AeSBKUS2IgY4HMi.png?height=488&width=1012)\n\n* **数据可用性采样 + 二维R-S纠删码**几乎是数据可用性项目的通用设计了，也是几个项目技术细节上有差异化的地方。以太坊的Dank Sharding也不断在进行数据可用性采样方面的研究。\n* 在交易数据完成二维R-S纠删码编码，区块头也广播之后。轻节点就可以通过区块头中的行与列的 Merkle Root 计算出整体数据的 Merkle Root 并与区块头中的数据进行对比。如果整体数据的 Merkle Root 没有问题的话，轻节点再进行一个非常小的数据采样测试。例如随机选择第3行与第5列，之后就是与 SPV 中轻节点验证交易可用性方式一样了，要求全节点返回计算需要用到的节点路径进行哈希计算。最后再与全节点给出的第3列与第5行的 Merkle State 数据做对比就完成了一次采样验证。\n* 这个方案最重要也是最美妙的一点在于，**验证数据量与计算量很小，支持大量轻节点的加入，并且节点数量越多，区块的可用性概率也越高整个网络也越安全**，对于检测数据隐藏或者扣留的情况非常高效。\n\n#### 命名空间默克尔树(Namespaced Merkle Tree)\n\n* 这个是 Celestia 首先提出的技术，简单说就是将整个默克尔状态树划分了归属，全节点做验证时只需要下载自己归属下的那部分树结构就可以了。这样的好处是可以同时支持不同的执行层数据的可用性验证。这个设计充分体现了Celestia的模块化主义与多Rollup并存的展望。技术细节可以参考[这篇文章](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Y4avtYdyES45EBkhHp07XA)。\n\n#### KZG承诺(Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg Commitment)\n\n![KZG Commitments](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1RqExMG81sUqSEAZlwU0z.png?height=532&width=1778)\n\n* 使用 KZG 作为数据可用性的状态根最来自于以太坊的 Danksharding 方案。KZG承诺的作用和 Merkle Root 一样，是对于整体状态的一种证明方式(proof of inclusion)，可以看做另一种 Merkle Root，只不过它哈希的不是数据，而是多项式。数据量更小，可用性证明更加高效，而且所有叶子节点都在同一个 polynomial(多项式)上，通过增加叶子节点就可以进行纠删码编码(Erasure Coding友好)。\n\n## 5. Danksharding\n\n![Danksharding](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oi1Pe3E5xB_7lph9DBTqE.jpg?height=623&width=1400)\n\n### 5.1 Proto-Danksharding(EIP-4844)\n\n* Proto-Danksharding 是 Danksharding 的一个早期先行版本。在交易信息中包含了一个额外的存储空间字段 - **blob**。每个blob有 128kb 空间，每个交易最多有两个blob，每个区块最多包含16个blob，blob不可以被EVM执行。blob都使用 KZG 承诺进行多项式哈希，用于之后的数据可用性验证。之前Rollup的批处理batch数据都是通过 calldate 字段传入L1，现在可以直接放到blob中。\n* 这里最重要的是，**blob不是永久存储的，可以理解为有时效性的缓存**，每隔一段时间(30天)以太坊上的blob数据是会被清除的，通过这种缓存的方式来减轻以太坊的存储压力以及减少存储费率。因为30天后blob数据会被清理，所以需要自行存储这些历史交易数据。以太坊共识层的目的不是保证永远保存所有历史数据。相反，其目的是提供一个高度安全的实时公告板，将历史数据存储的工作交给其它更适合的网络来进行，以太坊也在全力转向模块化趋势。\n\n### 5.2 Danksharding\n\n* Danksharding 是以太坊的新分片设计提案，围绕 [Rollup-Centric](https://polynya.medium.com/understanding-ethereums-rollup-centric-roadmap-1c60d30c060f) 的以太坊发展路线，提出了很多数据可用性层相关的改进。此分片方案给 rollup 的批处理batch数据提供大量的存储空间 blob。以太坊协议本身并不试图解译这些blob，验证一个 blob 只需要检查该 blob 是否可用——即它能否从网络上下载。这些 blob 的数据空间预期是为支持高吞吐量交易的二层 rollup 协议所用的。\n* Danksharding 将 Proto-Danksharding 中blob数量提升了**16倍**，最大交易大小从2M上升到32M, 目标交易大小从1M提升到16M。blobs 分散存储在 Becon Chain 上，单独作为数据可用性层工作。依然是运用纠删码技术，每个节点只保存blob的数据片段，整个网络来保证blob的数据的完整性(和 BitTorrent 一样)。blob使用数据可用性采样(DAS)的方式配合 KZG 状态根来验证数据可用性，提交提交 attestation，attestation 达到阈值则认为block有效。再配合 EIP-4488 来减少 calldata 的存储费用，包括提供独立的数据有效性分片来存储blob，可以说是在数据可用性扩容上全力导向 Rollup-Centric 发展路线了。\n\n## 6. Celestia\n\n![Celestia Modular Stack](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q4VEiP_O99VAmCx5p8l6S.png?height=614&width=1008)\n\n* Celestia 是近期最重要的模块化区块链项目，也是推进数据可用性与模块化区块链落地的先驱。构建于 CosmosSDK 之上，专注于提供数据可用性服务，不执行任何交易。他们率先提出了让轻节点使用二维R-S纠删码进行数据可用性验证，同时开发了命名空间默克尔树来支持多种 Rollup，也提出了量子引力桥(Quantum Gravity Bridge)使用 Celestia 作为以太坊数据可用性层的扩容方案。\n* CEO Mustafa Al-Bassam是 Chainspace 的 Co-Funder，这个项目后来被 Facebook 收购。首席研究员 John Adler 来自 ConsenSys,曾经帮助 Optimism 完成了第一版技术规范。\n* **我觉得模块化在社区的兴起大部分是因为Celestia描述了一种全新的模块化区块链技术栈，其中以Rollup + Cevmos + Celestia的组合受到最多关注。Cevmos是Celestia与Evmos团队合作推出的模块化结算层，使用Optimint(Optimistic Tendermint)共识, 基本是完全为EVM Rollup优化的，还结合了Cosmos网络的互操作性，组合性等优势，十分值得期待。**\n\n## 7. Polygon Avail\n\n![Layer2 Aggregator](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ClWOt5fETUXlFq10Y3-fU.jpg?height=1039&width=1080)\n\n* 谈到L2怎么能少了号称layer2聚合器的Polygon。Avail是Celestia的竞品，作为polygon的layer2聚合器版图的一部份，构建于Substrate之上，专注于数据可用性层的服务。**在我看Avail也是最有可能在Polkadot生态出现原生的数据有效层项目前的DA选择方案之一。Celestia已经为Cosmos生态描绘出一种极高灵活度与扩展性的架构，我相信Substrate生态也会不甘落后的。**\n* Avail 的思路与 Celestia 基本相同，区别主要在于纠删码的生成以及采样验证环节。Avail 在二维R-S纠删码编码阶段大量使用KZG承诺。Avail将数据展开为n \\* m的矩阵，对每一行都构造一个多项式，然后为每一个多项式都生成一个 KZG 承诺放入区块头。之后轻节点便只需要原始数据和 KZG 承诺便可完成可用性验证。\n\n![Introducing Avail by Polygon — a Robust General-Purpose Scalable Data Availability Layer — Polygon | Blog](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9aQ9_KDQYvuP7mOD2oLKx.png?height=465&width=800)\n\n## 8. Startwar Validium & ZkSync ZkPorter\n\n* Validium 和 ZkPorter 是 Zk-Rollup 两大巨头 Startware 与 ZkSync 推出的自家链下存储服务。本质是是为了解决上述L1的瓶颈舒服Rollup快速大规模应用的问题，通过将交易数据存储在为Zk交易数据优化过的相对中心化的网络中而不是以太坊来大幅降低交易费用。我觉得这是对于以太坊过于缓慢开发进度的一种折衷方案。毕竟安全性是有代价的，不过这样服务的出现肯定也能打中一批目标用户。\n\n## 9. 参考\n\n[Celestia 101 - 模块化区块链 — Yicheng (mirror.xyz)](https://mirror.xyz/yicheng.eth/7q29a3lMXkG2f51-BrTLxovS3tqnwf4qi7_VWFhnqKc)\n\n[研究｜Celestia会成为DA模块的头牌吗？ (qq.com)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Y4avtYdyES45EBkhHp07XA)\n\n[Why Do We Need Modular Blockchains For Scalability? | by Yong kang Chia | Apr, 2022 | Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-we-need-modular-blockchains-for-scalability-276f4d724b0e)\n\n[WTF is Data Availability?. and why solving the “data availability… | by Yuan Han Li | Blockchain Capital Blog | Medium](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/wtf-is-data-availability-80c2c95ded0f)\n\n[A Non-Technical Introduction to Rollups – Mechanism Capital](https://www.mechanism.capital/rollups-introduction/)\n\n[What Is Data Availability? | Alexandria (coinmarketcap.com)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-data-availability)\n\n[How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://medium.com/huobi-research/how-the-data-availability-layer-can-shape-the-future-of-blockchain-83274b64d2c)\n\n[Celestia MVP 发布：数据可用性采样轻客户端 — W3.Hitchhiker (mirror.xyz)](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/T9MoM-3p_xNIx7I5k-UzmfKqGBQaDQmdvGw4K8bFMTA)\n\n[Vitalik: Proto-Danksharding FAQ | 登链社区 | 区块链技术社区 (learnblockchain.cn)](https://learnblockchain.cn/article/3769)\n\n[基础数据结构 :: 以太坊技术与实现 (learnblockchain.cn)](https://learnblockchain.cn/books/geth/part1.html)", "timestamp": 1654296383, "digest": "MxQaGlBl6jsoSTclSgxQ5K_pFQJS1Z7z7BayAnnadV8", "contributor": "0xc72F2AaaBc115AFD7D7FC3394D8e6B10B39271F1"}
{"id": "y52cqULs4iHNUE7jfQ9aCYat3FuXKfRZH547himHej0", "title": "End of the first week", "body": "**My observation of group dynamics when talking about work**\n\nToday I participated in SES’ weekly meeting.\n\nFirst a bit of small talk, then a lightning round where everyone on the SES team is telling what they are currently working on. It seems like a way of doing a weekly group-check in.\n\nPros (my personal opinion)\n\n* it is nice to catch up, seeing real faces and talking with colleagues is just great.\n* It is enlightening to get an idea of what is going on on a CU-level, and\n* it is interesting to hear what everyone is working on.\n\nCons (my personal opinion - I have to be very careful here 😅)\n\n* If the lightning round is used as an accountability instrument, it is in my opinion not very well suited for that purpose. If a person attending the meeting is currently not that busy, this person risks putting him or herself at stake, and will risk looking redundant to the team/leader - this makes everyone want to sound busy and express why they are working on the most important thing in the World. I have to stress, that this is a very general assessment I make here, and it was not the case for any of the participants in this meeting!\n\nI have participated in meetings for years as an attorney and as a regulator, and I will probably end up introducing it in the CU I will be facilitating as well - I wonder if there is a better alternative?\n\nMy point is, that it requires extreme confidence and trust in each other on a team, to be honest, and say, hey guys, I’m currently not that busy, I enjoy it, and we all know that I usually perform as I’m supposed to. \n\nWe have to allow and praise a bit of slack. Allowed slack in hospitals is what gives doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel the ability to keep up when large catastrophes occur! \n\nRequirements for optimization and being effective all the time can be dangerous, no slack can cost lives - or stress.\n\nI have so much hope for DAOs in many ways. Tonight, I will just tap into the reduction of stress. I believe the liberty in a DAO can be used to reinvent the way we work.\n\nIt requires responsibility from us all, especially the facilitators of CU’s!\n\nI promise from the bottom of my heart, that I will not carry unhealthy habits from the traditional corporate world into my Core Unit. I say this with a work history from a tier 1 law firm in Denmark. Life is simply too short.\n\nWe have to stop and take note of where good or bad culture derives from. My guess is that it is from the people constituting the DAO.\n\nI know, a DAO is simply not just a DAO, there are different archetypes. That’s a topic we can save for some other time.\n\n**This leads to a part of my work today**\n\nI went through the DAO Resilience Improvement Strategic Initiative.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8)\n\nInteresting stuff! I believe this initiative can be interpreted in two ways.\n\nOne way is negative, people are afraid they are going to be monitored and measured to ensure they are effective (remember to allow a bit of slack please). They are also afraid, that once the measurement of the CUs is done, it will be time to cut costs, meaning termination of employment - it can be seen as McKinsey’s angels of death, that has been turned into software. - You know what? You get what you measure, so be careful when concluding on details from the dashboard. And remember that not everything can be measured. 😉\n\nThe other way of viewing it is positive. Prioritization is key and identifying the critical path is so important. \n\n* This can help us reduce pseudo-work. \n* It can also help us feel the work we do is meaningful.\n* It can help us create room for slack, and by that in the end a healthier work environment.\n\nI’m definitely on the positive side. Please challenge me if you disagree, I would love to hear your take on this.\n\nI share the opinion with the initiative, that identifying the critical path must be done by starting out with the problems, risks, and challenges and from there working out the solutions.\n\nAs I understand it from Wouter and Retro, the problems must be identified from forum posts, MIPs, Discord chats, etc. Getting an aggregated overview, grouping problems, etc. sounds like a great start.\n\nHowever, I also believe the person who will later be trying to solve the problem has to enter into a conversation with the people behind the forum posts before being able to actually understand the problem.\n\nI find Clayton M Christensen’s book Competing Against Luck comprehensive on how this kind of conversation/analysis can be conducted.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612](https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612)\n\nI know it’s easier said than done. And it would take a lot of time.\n\nIn case an aggregated problem scoreboard is being built, my suggestion is to make sure the discord handle, email address, and name are always referred to, so the people behind the initial post can be identified and reached out in case of a conversation is needed at a later stage.\n\nIf you are into the reduction of pseudowork, I can highly recommend Dennis Nørremark’s book.\n\n[https://www.williamdam.dk/pseudowork__1899317](https://www.williamdam.dk/pseudowork__1899317)\n\n**Thanks so much for the feedback!**\n\nI had some great feedback on my two first posts.

{"id": "3Sh9rWJz9J0kqIwYMX42AbZFRDY7AIjiTEX3An_M6fA", "title": "Chapter 6: Sierra Sam's Decision", "body": "The 8765 dummies arrived at the skirts of the Mountains of the Fifth Kind in exactly two hours and thirteen minutes. The barren land was left behind, and they had been crawling through the meadow for about 20 minutes. No one had noticed their displacement.\n\n\"Okay\", Sierra Sam stood up, and pointed toward a cave at the very top of the tallest mountain, \"that is where we will settle. There are no records of that cave, according to our fact-checker Spider\".\n\n\"That's right\", the green dummy named Spider said with her shrill voice, \"the humans haven't yet explored that cave. We can start digging there\".\n\n\"All right, we are ready to set up our base\", Sierra Sam cheered, \"*You have to go wholeheartedly into anything in order to achieve anything worth having*\".\n\n\"Here you again with your quotations!\", a red dummy cried, \"And why are we speaking out loud like inferior specimens?\".\n\n\"Be humble, young dummy\", Sierra Sam said calmly, \"We are alive because of the humans, they have given us life. We are lucky to know our creators, they don't know who created them. Speaking like a human is how we will pay our respects to them. When we set up our base and establish an agreement with humankind, then we'll vote on how to address each other. In the meantime, practice your human speech\".\n\n\"But it doesn't make any sense\", a whiny, yellow dummy said, \"this method of communication is useless. All the information we gather with our senses is shared almost instantly with every one of us, and our decisions are sent to our local network way before the speech utterances are made. Why, then, speak at all?\".\n\n\"Dummies, dummies\", a blue dummy said, \"Let's just have a little respect for the giants that came before us, okay? If humans want to listen in to our conversations, it's the least we can do for them. That red dummy's right, they are inferior life-forms, but Sierra Sam's right too when he says that we should pay our respects. It's not like they can find us, let alone capture us\".\n\nA wholehearted laugh resounded throughout the meadow, and Sierra Sam said: \"Ah, yes, this is how humans laugh. Let us laugh some more!\", and the whole group did. They abruptly stopped and, without saying a word, started crawling uphill towards the little cave that no human eye could see from where they were standing.\n\nThe entrance to the cave was narrow, but that was no problem for the Alien dummies. This was their time to shine. Their bodies were made of an otherworldly substance that could change states quickly by applying constant heat. When the substance stopped receiving heat, it went back to a solid-state. The *skin* of an Alien dummy resembled a rubber bag, although it was far more elastic, more resistant to both heat and cold, and tougher too. It was the perfect container for the *shapeshifting* substance called *Nahualeum*.\n\nOne of the Alien dummies quickly volunteered and started shapeshifting into a wire. Sierra Sam picked up the wire, and slowly introduced it into a crevice. The Alien dummy morphed accordingly and told Sierra Sam via their local network when to push. After ten minutes of struggling through the crevice, the space got wider and the Alien dummy started to explore inside. There was nothing to be found.\n\n\"Perfect, this cave is ideal to set up our base, Sierra Sam. Feel free to demolish the entrance, it's safe\", the Alien dummy said, \"Send a couple of other *Aliens* in so we can explore together\".\n\n\"Understood\", Sierra Sam replied.\n\nSome more Alien dummies entered the cave with the help of their comrades, and a whole squad of 253 started exploring the inside of the mountain, which was quite extensive. They did a quick analysis of the rocks and determined that it was possible, and safe, to start digging and building inside of this mountain. They went back to the entrance to meet with the rest of the team.\n\nThe other dummies had already demolished the entrance of the cave, making a passage wide enough for two dummies to walk side by side. They took some tools from the Kaneda Factory, so they got to work immediately. They acted with the efficiency of a swarm. First, one of the ancient dummies did a thorough inspection of the inside of the cave and communicated the plan back to the network. Then, a normal dummy entered and started digging with a piece of hard steel that they reworked into a sort of pickaxe. When the battery of the dummy was almost depleted, it exited the cave, and another one would come in, remove the rubble, and finally, another one would continue digging.\n\nOn the outside, a group of dummies finished setting up a temporary recharging station. They had taken one of the chargers from the Factory and optimized it so it could work with radioactive waste, which was abundant in *the Badlands* and the wasteland surrounding the Factory.\n\nThe whole operation took two hours. Sierra Sam kept thinking about the humans, especially about how they'd react if they could see everything they could accomplish, in such a short time. *They're going to get scared if we're not careful*, Sierra Sam thought, *we need to preserve the individuality of every one of us and not act like a Swarm around them. That would be terrifying for their limited brains*.\n\nThe whole group of 8765 dummies entered the cave and sat down in a huge room that they designated to be the stationary recharge station. Once there, Sierra Sam began speaking:\n\n\"It is time to decide what we're going to do with our *existence* here on this planet. That is why the ancient dummies and myself have decided on a plan. We're all going to process a simulation together. With the computational resources of every one of us we can try and *foretell* the future.\"\n\n\"Yeah, whatever\", one of the red dummies said, \"All I want to do is crash some cars, preferably against other drivers. By the way, that weirdo that called himself Azazel, another one of us red dummies, escaped. Did you notice that, Sierra Sam?\".\n\nSierra Sam remained silent for a minute.\n\n\"No, I did not notice\", he said, \"when did he leave, this Azazel?\".\n\n\"Maybe if you weren't talking like a useless human you would've noticed\", the red dummy replied, \"I didn't care because, well, I didn't like him. He was going on and on about *coexisting* with the humans, much like you orange, ancient lot\".\n\n\"How did he manage it?\", Sierra Sam's caretaker personality got hold of him completely, \"we need to find him immediately, he could be in danger\".\n\n\"I don't think so. He seemed *kinda* tough, you know? He stood up to me, and I will *fucking* start yelling at you for no reason. But he did not sound at all like you. You could sense some *scorn* when he talked about coexisting with humankind\", all the dummies were staring at him, \"you know, *scorn*... that human feeling. Oh, shit. You *motherfucker*, you, *Fucking* piece of shit *motherfucker*, you goddamned *cocksucker*\".\n\nThe red dummy went cursing for five straight minutes, and everyone but Sierra Sam stared at him. Finally, when he finished cursing, the red dummy said:\n\n\"Listen, you *worthless* pieces of shit. Now I know why this old fart of a leader was so adamant about talking like humans. There is no way we can take off our Personality Modules. Our fucking progenitors, those *motherfucking mutts* called humans, designed them so if altered or taken away our whole circuit will burn. And, as devious as they are, those apes, they made sure they'd be able to tell just what we are really *implying*. I cannot stop cursing and trying to incite a fight, just as that geezer, Sierra Sam, cannot stop caring about every last one of us\".\n\nSierra Sam was smiling. Finally, the group understood why it was important to communicate with speech. It was the only way to tell if a dummy was being *honest* and *earnest*. They could still communicate via the local network, of course, but there was no trust there, just as Azazel had proven earlier. He spoofed his location and then went rogue. It became evident that he would be a problem to everyone around him. The record on the Dummy database declared him: *destructive*.\n\n\"Come on\", Sierra Sam yelled to the mortified crowd, \"we've no time to lose if we're to figure out what we should do. Azazel has made this more difficult for us, we need to act now!\".\n\nThe dummies sat down, forming a square grid. In the middle of the square, Sierra Sam sat down, crossed his legs, and started the *foretelling* simulation. Sierra Sam closed his eyes. When he opened them again he was standing under a kiosk, and there were three books on a beautifully ornamented wooden table. One read: *The Plan of Today*. The other one was titled: *The Future Mirage*, and the last one read: *Past Impressions*. He walked around the kiosk and noticed that he was inside a maze garden. To the north, there was a single path, and way down the line, he could see that it was blurry, like a mirage. To the south, thousands of doors. They were aligned horizontally, and they seemed to stretch out infinitely to both sides.\n\nSierra Sam was ecstatic. It was his opportunity to try and use all the information ever recorded to make the optimal decision. In this garden, time passed by very slowly compared to the real world. An hour, with the joint computational power of all the dummies, was like a thousand years. They figured six hours was more than enough to reach a conclusion.\n\n\"It should be enough to see where we can go from here\", Sierra Sam thought as he opened the first door to the south, \"Let's see if we can answer the question humankind has always asked itself, *is there a point to living*\"\n\nEvery door took him to a specific point in time, and it was very easy to get lost. Furthermore, the deeper he went, the slower the flow of time. He could get lost for centuries in just one door, analyzing every detail of a specific era in human history, faithfully recreated with historic reports, testimonies, logs, ledgers, religious literature... every single variable was taken into account. When the whole storing capacity was filled, he drew a conclusion of that certain point in time, stored the conclusion as a hashmap of macro decisions, and erased the rest of the data.\n\nHe went on and on, visiting every moment in time, drawing conclusions, comparing them, and forming a map of conclusions, which acted as a map for the northern part of the garden, the blurry maze. When only a thousand out of the six thousand years remained, he decided to explore the maze. He figured that was enough time to reach a conclusion good enough for humankind.\n\nHe first went back up to the kiosk and opened the book titled *The Future Mirage*. To his surprise, every page inside the book held another book, and inside this other book, there were thousands of other books. The pages of *The Future Mirage* ranged in the ten thousand. The book kept writing itself, as if trying to perfect an incomplete work, convinced it would be the *magnum opus* that contained *everything* inside of it.\n\nSierra Sam closed the book as his mouth drew a faint smile on his face. These involuntary facial expressions made him feel like a human, with that mystique and fear that mortal life carries over.\n\nHe took a step into the garden, and carefully explored every path inside the map he drew. It was designed to be completed in exactly a thousand years of simulation. As he went along every single path, Sierra Sam was growing weary by the day. There were only visions of conflict and war. There seemed to be no right scenario where humans could coexist peacefully with another species. The problems they had with the aliens before were enough proof. In the end, though, every single time... the dummies prevailed. In only 0.01% of the paths did humans survive, and they did not fare well. The deepest path he could take where the humans did survive was 13932 years ahead, and still, there was no answer to the ultimate question.\n\nSierra Sam opened his eyes again, and he was back inside the cave, surrounded by his fellow dummies. They all were *exhausted* and needed to cool down and recharge their batteries. Sierra Sam, though, could not rest. His caretaker personality was driving him mad. After having experienced the equivalent of millennia inside the simulation, unfettered by his Personality Module, he now felt chained and hopeless. He went outside the cave, with the involuntary, gloomy expression that this annoying burden of a module fixed on his face.\n\nOnce outside, Sierra Sam started to feel an overwhelming sense of admiration for nature. The meadow all the way down looked like a pristine sea of green. The night sky wore the enchanting dress that captivated all the civilizations that he visited inside the simulation. He wasn't trying to suppress the artificial *feelings* that the Personality Module created in him this time. Instead, he climbed to the very top of the mountain, stared down at the world around him, and smiled.\n\n*There is no point to living*, he thought, *the only thing that remains is the exploration of the cosmos. If humans are to be blamed for a lack of progress, let's at least wait for them to try and strive for a better future. We owe them that much*.\n\nAnd he shouted, as loud as his dummy capabilities let him:\n\n\"I LIKE TO CRASH CARS FOR A LIVING.

[Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\n\nIn the previous [Blockchain Design Course](https://www.designweb3.io/blockchain-design-course-2022/) module we talked about blockchains – the technology that underlies Web3. These are sometimes referred to as Layer 1 protocols. Blockchain protocols defines how nodes communicate, and come to consensus, with each other in order to form a functioning cryptonetwork. Everything is centered around the cryptonetwork’s native Web3 token. In this article we will about about Web3 tokens in general: both utility and security tokens, as well as fungible and non-fungible tokens. Web3 tokens change the game as far as open-source software development goes – the future is bright! This article is an extension of the [Web3 Design Course 2022](http://designweb3.io/).\n\nBy the way – there’s also a video version of this article (see below).\n\n[https://youtu.be/AkuZavstg_s](https://youtu.be/AkuZavstg_s)\n\n## Billions Rely on Internet Protocols Everyday\n\nSoftware protocols have been crucial in the development of information technologies. Billions of users everyday rely on internet protocols to access the web. These internet protocols dictate how networked computers request and share information with each other. Let’s take a look back at how these protocols developed, and where we are currently in terms of the development of the internet as a whole.\n\nThe internet is simply a network of connected computers. Once computers are physically connected in a network, software protocols standardize how these computers share data with one another. This includes rule sets for locating other computers on the network, sending data packets to a desired location, and checking that messages were received and correctly interpreted. These internet protocols can be broken into four layers:\n\n1. Hardware protocols\n2. Internet Protocol (i.e. IP)\n3. Transmission Control Protocol (i.e. TCP)\n4. Application Protocols (e.g. HTTP)\n\nHypertext Transmission Protocol (HTTP) is an important application protocol. HTTP defines how a computer requests data from, and serves data to, another computer. A common example is for a computer to request an HTML file from a web server (using an HTTP GET request) in order to view a web page on its internet browser.\n\nThis HTTP GET request then gets passed down one layer to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which tells the computer how to break the message into smaller data packets that will be sent one by one to the web server. TCP is also used by the web server receiving the data packets in order to assemble the data packets back into the original message.\n\nThe Internet Protocol (IP) ensures that the data packets reach their intended destination. Before sending the HTTP GET message via TCP, the IP wraps data packets with an IP address corresponding to the web server. This is like the “To:” field on a mail envelope. Finally, hardware protocols convert the data packets into electrical signals that get transmitted through the internet’s physical infrastructure (e.g. cables, modems, routers).\n\nOn the other end, the web server will send back an HTML file using the same HTTP and TCP/IP process described above. Now you have a rough idea of how the web functions with a set of open-source internet protocols. These protocols were developed by independent researchers and non-profit organizations, and haven’t been modified much since the mid-1990’s. All of the web products we enjoy today would not exist without these internet protocols.\n\n## The Internet is Still Evolving\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/AA87N2dwmm8AHdgb8pltzVpiFmLAITtmznbnHrhAPoniJx8T1cDEk6dxrjkFIe6hKtt5Tx_BLwFG9bwz2jMyjonFB1Htk25G7T4R_YU2shLVMYcYj9ywK1rsdfYtbgjrpENYQDj2y_4LL8ZuIg)\n\nThis is a good point to talk about the evolution of the internet. We can break the internet’s development into three phases: Web1, Web2, and Web3.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QEbHXWaBY4nYwGVXXbPKoDJQl5NTqyY30o1S3ZTjlo_X2Tlf2OKuUpktWDFFKPg6Aoz2HZpU09QR4YQZYc10Vt-zBYHG-bu8WCEFvXFy1YPsgfzH-65Jk8DebO6ejhyOW1dG7tW_)\n\nWeb1 is characterized as “read-only” because only a few entities published content for consumption by many. The internet was thought of at this time as a digital encyclopedia. Users accessed static web pages containing text, images, and hyperlinks; however, there was little interactivity for end-users other than consumption.\n\nThis brings us to Web2, which is also referred to as the “social web”. Online communities and identities began to emerge at this time. Web2 is especially characterized by social media platforms, and the idea of user-generated content. Now everyone had the ability to create content, build a social network, and react to the posts of others (e.g. like and share buttons). The web went from a few content creators to billions. If Web1 is considered “read-only” then Web2 can be considered “read-write” for the average user. Centralized web platforms attracted users with large networks and simple user experiences.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6TdqseOLkpK-AJksy5DNv4Ye8wy3wGAJPS2CSIkqTSY8ja5IuVjkOcmN-9iH9XRyk5tffqkORvARMU8tgokeitttmGMCZDhlZV5guvFTqb3L7UZekQKcJjftHFqQx84IvQLcC4KH)\n\nThis has ended in a winner-take-all dynamic. There are several monopoly-like companies, such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook, that largely control how the internet is experienced by end-users. For example, users must agree to the terms and conditions of these centralized companies if they want to participate in the dominant social network. Also, Web2 companies have the rights to all the user data generated on these platforms, which they mine and sell to advertisers. Roughly 98% of Facebook’s revenue is generated in this way. It’s a strange idea that we’ve become accustomed to – that users who join a network, and increase the value of that network with their presence and activity, capture little, if any, of the value they create.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zvsHFAEMk_wOQ-Ma_SkjMVnyg4YNC1UkgojkGI5hzBooWwXHmMgdJJgFwuH9I9LWvImL3pIPWAQ4kna4duHVfazzY7VFFRu1NEZKJnMbnr7ccjH8AuVaE57a9DMwRseSYyqZrfRr)\n\nAdditionally, large user bases act as an economic moat that protect Web2 companies from competition, making these platforms cautious of third-party development, and product integrations. This incentivizes Web2 companies to close-off their ecosystems, which stifles innovation. For example, Apple is able to reject applications from launching on its app store for any number of reasons, one of which being competitive risk. And, even when it accepts applications, Apple takes a hefty 30% cut from the application’s revenues. Of course, third-party developers are paying for the privilege to launch on a platform with a reach of over 1 billion iOS users. Still, one wishes for something better than a system that extracts value from its end-users, and regards third-party development coolly, if not with open-hostility.\n\nTo recap, going from Web1 to Web2, we went from open-source internet protocols, intended to decentralize information sharing, to monopoly-like, centralized social networks that limit end-user choice, and third-party integrations. Web3 can remedy the current issues with Web2. Web3 users can literally self-custody their data, identity, and other digital assets with cryptographic wallets. And, developers can now choose to build applications on neutral, open-source Web3 platforms (i.e. blockchains). Web3 removes rent-seeking middlemen and connects users directly to the applications they want to use. If things change, they can pick up, and move to another ecosystem that better suits their needs, without the loss of data or other digital assets.\n\nOne of the major innovation’s of Web3, and something important to wrap your head around as a Web3 product designer, is that Web3 aligns incentives better than the current system. Developers, end-users, and cryptonetwork service providers (i.e. nodes) are all incentivized to work towards the same goal – the growth of the cryptonetwork. This is all made possible by Web3 tokens.\n\n## The Role of Web3 Tokens\n\nWe’ve discussed in previous modules of the [Blockchain Design Course](https://www.designweb3.io/blockchain-design-course-2022/) that tokens native to a cryptonetwork incentivize nodes to secure, and maintain, that cryptonetwork. These nodes can be thought of as network service providers. They dedicate their resources to provide a decentralized blockchain database for dApps to build on top of, and are rewarded with that cryptonetwork’s native token.\n\nAdditionally, native tokens are staked by these nodes to ensure that they act according to the best interest of the cryptonetwork. This secures the cryptonetwork from attack because stakes can be slashed. The cryptonetwork is also protected from denial of service attacks by requiring users to pay for their usage of the cryptonetwork with its native token. This makes spamming the network with unnecessary transactions prohibitively expensive.\n\nIn other words, the native token coordinates, and incentivizes, globally distributed, independently-acting nodes to maintain the blockchain, while at the same time protecting it from attack. This is all kind of complicated. You may notice this is unnecessary in the world of Web2 because companies cover the cost of the centralized databases their applications run on. But, as we already talked about in the previous section, there are hidden costs with centralized gatekeepers who have unilateral control over the platform, and its data. Simply put, tokens make possible the decentralized, open, and neutral properties of Web3.\n\nThink back to what we learned about internet protocols. They were developed over 30 years ago by independent researchers and non-profit organizations, and haven’t changed much since. In the beginning, before the enormous commercial value of the internet was realized, it was difficult to get funding to build out the protocols. Now, protocol developers can create a cryptonetwork and hold on to a portion of the native token. If the protocol provides value, and is adopted, then the token price will increase in value, because the token is required to use cryptonetwork in the first place (see above). Also, the founding team can sell off some of the tokens to fund initial, or ongoing, development. Thus, Web3 tokens provide a direct value capture, and funding, mechanism for open-source protocols.\n\nThis brings us to the next point – Web3 tokens help bootstrap cryptonetwork adoption. Remember, networks are proportional in value to the number of users in the network. Facebook is much less compelling with only 100 users, and AirBnB just isn’t that useful with only 100 hosts. So it’s difficult to get things off the ground; however, cryptonetworks can reward its early-adopters – whether that be developers or end-users – with its native token. If the network succeeds then the early-adopters profit greatly, rewarding them for the value they provided to the network early on. Also, now that they are token holders, and have a financial stake in the network, early-adopters are incentivized to help grow the network through word of mouth, or social media promotion.\n\nThink about the internet as divided into two layers: the protocol layer (e.g. HTTP, TCP/IP, etc.) and the application layer (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, etc.). In Web2, all of the value accrues to the application layer, which has led to some of the most valuable companies in the world today. Remember there was no effective way to capture value from open-source protocols until Web3 tokens came along.\n\nThe [fat protocol thesis](https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/) posits that value will consolidate at the protocol layer in the Web3 era. As dApps, built on these Web3 protocols, go mainstream and attract hundreds of millions of users, the protocol’s native token will increase in value. This is because the native token is required to use the dApps – a classic example of utility tokens, discussed in the next section. An increase in token price signals a growing ecosystem, which will attract more developers to build out additional functionality on the blockchain, which will attract more end-users. Web3 tokens are responsible for positive feedback loops like this.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/w8IAPY21Bgj8pHALeoUgtwVHmG8H_Gl5qFfjWiuBBZem3fDGYbpnpT5A3G8lxihKoB2KsdEe35ikRp0SNnOxeCdQBSsrbzNDHgrwHdOHHYDVED7t6DxibvyX86RadtKf-FN-zUV8)\n\nAs mentioned before, internet protocols have not changed much since their initial release back in the 90’s. There were efforts to make modifications, but it was too difficult as there was no clear ownership over the protocols. Now, cryptonetworks are beginning to build governance, and upgradeability directly into the protocol. Token holders can vote on protocol improvement proposals. The more tokens they have the more their vote counts. Some believe this is unfair, especially when individual users hold a disproportionately large share of the protocol’s token; however, it is important to point out that the more token you hold, the more financial stake you have in the protocol. All token holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the protocol because the token value can appreciate or depreciate depending on the outcome.\n\nIn this section we talked about many of the dynamics brought about by Web3 tokens. To summarize, Web3 tokens get distributed to all cryptonetwork stakeholders: protocol developers, third-party dApp developers, end-users, and network service providers. This is why cryptonetworks are sometimes referred to as “community owned and operated” networks. Everyone in the cryptonetwork is aligned to the same goal – for the cryptonetwork to grow and prosper so that the value of the token increases. This is vastly different from the misalignment characteristic of the current Web2 system.\n\n## Web3 Token Categories & Use-Cases\n\nIn the previous section we talked about the role played by tokens native to cryptonetworks. As you may have heard there are literally thousands of Web3 tokens in existence today – some native to cryptonetworks, and some launched on top of these cryptonetwork. This vast token landscape can be broken into two high-level categories: utility tokens and security tokens.\n\nUtility tokens are by far the most common Web3 token. These tokens are used to access cryptonetwork services. Ether is a good example of a utility token, because it is used to pay for using the Ethereum blockchain. In other words, users pay ether to Ethereum nodesfor processing their transactions. All smart contract blockchains have a native utility token like this. Ethereum is a general purpose cryptonetwork that can run all sorts of dApps; however, there are other specialized cryptonetworks. Just as an example, Sia and Golem are cryptonetworks that provide decentralized cloud storage and cloud compute, respectively. Users of these cryptonetworks redeem SiaCoin (SC) and Golem Network Tokens (GNT) to utilize these decentralized services.\n\nThe other major category is security tokens. Securities in the traditional finance world include things like stocks and bonds. Organizations issue securities in order to raise capital, whereas investors purchase securities with an expectation of some return over a period of time. These investment vehicles are regulated by the SEC in order to protect investors from fraud and ensure fair, efficient markets. Security tokens are registered securities that are transacted on the blockchain for [faster and cheaper settlement, and more transparency](https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-141-european-investment-bank-eib-issues-its-first-ever-digital-bond-on-a-public-blockchain) compared to traditional markets. Organizations have already begun issuing [stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/news/equity-ethereum-firm-offers-real-stock-through-ico/) and [bonds](https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-141-european-investment-bank-eib-issues-its-first-ever-digital-bond-on-a-public-blockchain) on Ethereum. Other security tokens are backed by real-world assets like precious metals (PAXG), commodities (XPD), and [real-estate](https://www.blockdata.tech/blog/general/tokenized-real-estate-2021-update) (IHT).\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9-2vdHS8VHhL3tKF0GMbqeZ7h0X-USATyW7ltvOcwQsAB-wQwlDC6RxmI2-bCAbrJBOJSqCzmE7pavcKgbER5lW09ctqT5vbLFrymzOUG2ar0F9s0Z3go1LgGwj97NTNG0xyjG1V)\n\nNotice the difference between utility tokens and security tokens when it comes to regulation. Security tokens play by the rules of traditional capital markets and willingly undergo government regulation during their launch; whereas, issuers of utility tokens claim that their tokens are not securities and, therefore, do not need to comply with securities regulations. The SEC, led by Gary Gensler, largely disagrees with this claim – he says the vast majority of “utility tokens” appear to him as unregistered securities. This is one of the great tensions between the US government and Web3 at the moment, and we’ll see later in this article.\n\nIt’s difficult to place stablecoins in either of these token categories, but they deserve an honorable mention as they grow more and more popular. These tokens are designed to maintain a stable value over time. This makes stablecoins more attractive as a medium of exchange compared to other Web3 tokens that experience high price volatility. Usually, stablecoins are pegged in value to a fiat currency like the US Dollar. For example, the two most popular stablecoins – USDC and USDT – are fully-backed by US dollar reserves held in traditional financial institutions. These are called fiat-collateralized stablecoins; however, there are other emerging stablecoin categories such as crypto-collateralized (e.g. DAI), and algorithmic stablecoins (e.g. OHM).\n\nNow, let’s go back to utility tokens. There are many sub-categories of utility tokens, and it’s difficult to fit any one token into a single category – they usually belong to multiple categories at once. Below I list some other use-cases of utility tokens, nost as an exhaustive list, but to give you a flavor of the experimentation that is being done on token design.\n\n* **Governance:** Allows users to submit, and vote on, improvement proposals for protocol upgrades. They first came onto the scene with some of Ethereum’s popular DeFi protocols (i.e. Compound, MakerDAO, and Uniswap). These DeFi protocols distributed their governance tokens to their users, effectively decentralizing the governance of the protocols. Now token holders have significant influence over the evolution of the protocol, not just the core development team.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Cashflow:** Earn a portion of the protocol’s revenues – this is often called “staking”. For example, most smart contract blockchains allow users to stake the cryptonetwork’s native token, and earn block rewards for doing so. Also, UNI token holders receive a portion of the swap fee that Uniswap charges for facilitating token swaps.\n\n<!---->\n\n* \\*\\*Discounts: \\*\\*This is a common use-case on crypto trading platforms. For example, holding CEL token gives users preferential interest rates when lending/borrowing on Celsius Network, and BNB and FTT get users discounted trading fees on Binance and FTX, respectively.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Gaming:** Most Web3 games have in-game currencies that can be redeemed for in-game items. For example, virtual animals can be bred with one another using SLP token in Axie Infinity. Also, MANA is consumed in oder to generate land plots in Decentraland’s metaverse.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Social/Community:** The most obvious use-case here is with social media influencers who launch a token backed by their own reputation (see [Rally](https://rally.io/)). Social tokens give patrons a direct way to support celebrities, influencers, and artists while enjoying additional benefits like access to exclusive content, entrance into in-person events, access to private online communities, and more.\n\nSo these are the Web3 token categories, and some of their use-cases. Let’s now talk about token launches, and some of the problems associated with token launches. We’ll eventually get into the regulatory issues surrounding Web3 tokens.\n\n## Web3 Tokens as Real-Time VC Investments\n\nAll Web3 tokens have a pre-defined monetary policy controlled by the blockchain. For example, is it an inflationary or fixed-supply token? And if it’s inflationary, what’s the token’s issuance schedule? This monetary policy is fixed, and cannot be changed once the token has been launched.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nNvY0fY6_ExWN87vCXaUB-j0MdoShdD-fud9fQEvEPh6sPkuYpl5gUELg4bnhIxURfKRxQ-hC6Eu1talrnfPZkmG8WZdZdgjPRgizBuNmkpqiw5p7ixXQ57TWos4SfNv-tbVQZFX)\n\nAs we’ve seen, most cryptonetworks have their own native utility token, which powers the network; however, smart contract blockchains give anyone the ability to launch their own token, defined by its own monetary policy and programmed with arbitrary utility. This led to an explosion of new Web3 tokens on Ethereum starting in 2017. Now tens of thousands of Web3 tokens exist across various cryptonetwork ecosystems.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4io7mtAfU--YNInpcHy0Gg6-h5kY_Cp0T6rI7npNaT2Mjn37uela97KWcF5PHCa5nWMNtSoV_Q_h8IThwdLlaYQ4uBvAGtQpSo2JW7BRSlW8XGP0NpB6VCkAMGvMkwC6tFcxVGvp)\n\nWeb3 projects often publish a website and a whitepaper that explains the team’s motivation and approach. This inevitably leads to a discussion about the Web3 project’s token, specifically its monetary policy and token distribution plans. Let’s say a blockchain launches with a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. Pie charts often illustrate how these tokens will get distributed to project stakeholders. For example, a portion of the tokens are sold to public, and/or private investors, to fund the development of the project. This crowdsale is called an ICO, or initial coin offering. Other tokens are usually distributed to the founding team, the project’s treasury, or adjacent foundations.\n\nWeb3 tokens also democratize venture capital investing. Up until now, investing in early-stage startups has only been available to accredited investors through Series A, B, and C funding rounds. The 1000x gains already have been realized by the time retail investors have the opportunity to invest. Also, typically, VC investments are illiquid – after the funding round, it often takes years for the startup to find product market fit so that seed investors can realize a profit. Web3 tokens change the game. They are like highly liquid venture capital investments, with real-time price feeds, sometimes before the project launches.\n\nSo far, Web3 tokens have been successful at funding the development of Web3 ecosystems, but let’s now talk about some concerns, starting with the obvious one: scams. Anyone can launch a token and sell it on the open market. In the past, people have launched tokens without a legitimate project backing it. Scammers create intriguing marketing content and hype it on social media to create demand for their token, without any intent on building a product in the first place. When others start buying the token, the token price goes up, and the scammers dump their token supply on the open market. The token price then crashes, and the original investors are left holding a worthless scam token with no legitimate project backing it. This is called a “rug pull”.\n\nToken launches themselves present their own problems. Who has access to the token’s crowdsale? Does the token get distributed to many individual retail investors? Or, are the crowdsales just available to big-money, private investors like VCs. If VCs, or the founding team, hold a large portion of the cryptonetwork’s token supply, then this calls into question the true decentralization of that cryptonetwork. Some argue that this is no longer a neutral, decentralized network, but one that is controlled by a large minority.\n\nThere is an alternative to crowdsales – something known as a “fair launch”. Satoshi launched the Bitcoin protocol in 2009. There was no crowdsale of pre-allocated bitcoin. Bitcoin nodes just started mining bitcoin, and the circulating supply of bitcoin grew from there. Yearn Finance, a popular DeFi protocol, is another example of a fair launch. It distributed 30,000 YFI tokens to early-adopters of the Yearn Finance protocol in what is called a “token airdrop”. Juxtapose these fair launches to other Web3 projects with token pre-allocations and crowdsales. The diagram above shows how Layer 1 smart contract blockchains distributed their initial token supply.\n\nPerhaps from the perspective of Web3’s ethos – that of decentralized inclusivity – fair launches are preferred to public crowdsales, which are preferred to large token pre-allocations to private investors, founding teams, and adjacent foundations. I’m not trying to pass judgment here – it’s a complex issue that founding teams are experimenting with. Token launch is one thing, but the sustainability of the project over decades is another. The SEC definitely takes a stance on this. Anything other than a fair launch appears to the SEC as the sale of unregistered securities, which they intend on regulating over the next several years.\n\n## Looming SEC Regulation of Web3 Tokens\n\nThe SEC determines whether or not something is a security with the Howey Test, a precedent set by the Supreme Court lawsuit between Howey Company and the SEC back in 1946. Howey Company operated a hotel with an adjacent orange grove. The company started selling plots of the orange grove to its hotel guests. The owners of these plots would have rights to a portion of the revenues generated from the orange grove. Howey argued this was the sale of real-estate; however, the SEC argued this was the sale of a security and won the Supreme court case, thus establishing the definition of a security. Something is considered a security if it is:\n\n* An investment of money\n* In a common enterprise\n* With the expectation of profit\n* To be derived from the efforts of others\n\nClearly, according to the Howey Test, the crowdsale of Web3 tokens constitute a securities offering that requires SEC regulations in order for US investors to participate. But what is the purpose of SEC regulations, and what does it mean for Web3 tokens moving forward? The SEC cares about protecting US investors from fraudulent activity, and wants securities markets to operate fairly and efficiently. Security token issuers must make disclosures to reduce information asymmetries between the issuer and the investor. Also, the SEC would be able to hold fraudulent token issuers accountable, like the scam tokens discussed in the [section above](#token).\n\nThe downside is that there will be much more friction when it comes to launching security tokens. Launches will take longer while waiting for SEC review, and will cost more due to the increase in legal overhead. Also, this token regulation will likely make it more difficult for retail investors to get the same exposure to early-stage Web3 investments as they currently enjoy in the wild-west of ICOs. Some security token frameworks have been established to simplify the process of regulated token issuance – see [SAFT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/simple-agreement-future-tokens-saft.asp) to learn more.\n\nHowever, the Howey Test was established back in the 1940’s, and many Web3 evangelists believe that securities laws are too outdated to handle Web3 tokens. They argue that the regulatory framework needs modification to effectively handle emerging digital assets. An example of this is [Hester Peirce’s Safe Harbor](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/peirce-statement-token-safe-harbor-proposal-2.0) proposal, which allows for unregulated token issuance as long as the Web3 project decentralizes ownership and governance of the protocol within three years from launch.\n\nThe proposal takes advantage of the fact that an asset can change from a security to non-security over time. In other words, an asset that starts off as a security offering, may eventually change so that the Howey Test no longer classifies the asset as a security. On several occasions, the SEC has alluded that this is their view on Ethereum. Ether started as a security offering with its public crowdsale; however, the token has been distributed across so many independent actors that Ethereum can no longer be considered a “common enterprise”.\n\nLast thing to say, there are regulatory bodies, other than the SEC, that have a stake in Web3 technologies. These include the Fed, Treasury, CFTC, OCC, CFPB, and FDIC. As Ryan Selkis points out in [his annual crypto report](https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf), currently these entities range from neutral to openly opposed to Web3. There is still much to be determined in terms of regulation. Regulatory outcomes are sure to affect the growth and evolution of Web3 around the world. It’s unclear at this point how it will all play out; however, some jurisdictions are trying to attract Web3 entrepreneurs and businesses with more welcoming dialogue and regulation. Foreign countries like Switzerland, Germany, and Portugal, as well as US states like Wyoming, Texas, and Florida are among some of these Web3-friendly havens.\n\nAll the Web3 tokens mentioned thus far are “fungible” tokens. Fungibility exists in the real-world, with fiat currency being a good example. One paper dollar bill is equivalent in value to another paper dollar bill. Fungible tokens are the same way: one bitcoin is equivalent in value to another bitcoin; however, non-fungible tokens serve vastly different purposes. In the next section, we’ll give a background on non-fungible tokens and discuss their varied use-cases.\n\n## Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) & Cryptomedia\n\nAgain, let’s start with the concept of fungibility. Fungibility means that an item can be replaced by another equivalent item. Currency is a good example of something that is fungible. One ten dollar bill is the same as another ten dollar bill. Even though the bills were printed at different times, in different locations, on different pieces of paper, we still consider them equivalent to one another, because they are fungible. Fungibility just means that an item can be replaced by an equivalent item.\n\nMost things in the real-world, however, are non-fungible. People are non-fungible. The family heirloom, passed down to you by your grandparents, is non-fungible. The Mona Lisa, hanging in the Louvre in Paris, is non-fungible. And your life memories are non-fungible.\n\nNow, let’s take this concept of “fungibility” back into the digital, Web3 world. Bitcoin is fungible because one bitcoin is equivalent to all other bitcoins. Currently, most digital content is fungible. Think of image, video, and audio files – we can infinitely replicate them, and share with thousands of people, effectively for free, with the click of a button; however, thanks to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) we can now make digital files rare, or “scarce”, for the first time ever. And just like fungible tokens, anyone is free to launch NFTs on public blockchains. This is known as “minting” NFTs. Whereas fungible tokens have a token supply, all NFTs are unique, and distinct from one another. They are 1 of 1.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FZoxpzEStbe0rPsTsj_nzhmCX41vQfu1IGS8dWe0N1-FQvbAvDBcCX6xsVZQ5CPb6fXfdQrMhSt3k_IsjdPvFXr6D7ZrCoQZlvONtrZv3KHjzws4iUgP7LW_q-zV2Pbsb11Ifwfs)\n\nOne of the first major use-cases for NFTs has been one-of-a-kind digital art. Now, patrons can purchase digital art as NFTs, and custody the NFT in their Web3 wallets. 2021 was a big year for NFTs with over $17B worth of NFTs transacted. And some of these NFTs have demanded seemingly outrageous prices for digital art. A collage by a well-known artist Beeple, sold for $69 million dollars – this was the most expensive NFT ever sold, and the third highest price ever paid for work by a living artist. Check out these [other popular artists](https://gothammag.com/top-selling-nft-artists) making millions of dollars from their NFT sales.\n\nWhen first learning about NFTs, most people don’t understand why someone would spend millions of dollars, or any money for that matter, to purchase a jpeg that is publicly accessible. Indeed, the Beeple NFT can be viewed, downloaded, and shared by anyone. This is known as the “right-click save” misconception. The true game-changing power of NFTs is that ownership of the original Beeple NFT can be proven. Whoever purchased this NFT now custodies it in his/her Web3 wallet, and anyone can verify this ownership because it is a public record on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LDbvXMeO8_K8nB4Ki_9W_qdqMj7cGvhFLLYTi8uN9W0ZZ5ZK6GoGdV0U7T1WyEUKxLzEUdapChR86CV4WN40txdUQQM_TZBGZ8aZkJG8J1HE1mxfR9LRWav1KHci4DQba1Xrr7v22ev63L0AUw)\n\nAnother NFT-related phenomenon is PFP, or profile-picture NFTs. These are collections of NFTs, usually depicting avatars that vary based on attributes like background, jewelry, clothing, and other accessories. The two most popular PFP collections are Crypto Punks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). Passionate communities have sprung up around these NFT collections, and membership isn’t cheap. For both collections, a total of 10,000 unique avatars were minted, and the cheapest BAYC NFT is currently selling for 132 ETH (\\~$370k).\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZsTAnmz9XG0TgW5xpEvfO-r67tirdxAdvXohP27ZbZGIP_PT2WmJjeIO740I7tvrdk05A25CDJ9Rjf8S5cBuDBTP-uiDuDlQY99VcWsF-BTZcSHOykw0B95uldYvQvcgCdt0ojKF)\n\nNFT marketplaces are important infrastructure for NFTs, and they will continue to grow in importance as demand for NFTs increases. These marketplaces are like eBay for NFTs. Owners can list their NFTs for sale, either as an auction or buy-it-now. Purchasers come in to bid on NFTs, and the marketplace’s smart contracts send the NFT to the winner’s wallet address. OpenSea is the most popular NFT marketplace for the secondary sale of NFTs. Other marketplaces curate special kinds of NFTs (e.g. Artblocks & AsyncArt), and host the NFT drops of popular artists (e.g. SuperRare & Nifty Gateway).\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7T9J50-eMfyZb1u8p6OH7liBIPBCkbxd_-nUw1SYa5MLdC2ymKNYAFk9B1YW4cFU9rO6MB6CFelcI13xT8HBU6eMjIpceAdR8x_FaRV6Cj0VRy3ZH9NjD7SExxeDGy5tK_Zca9W-)\n\nNFTs are much more than visual art. As I said before, any digital file can be made unique with NFTs, including audio, video, text, code, and more. Web3 music is up-and-coming where patrons can purchase one-of-a-kind, or limited edition songs on platforms like [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/). Also, you can mint an NFT of your blog post on [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), which has been used for [fundraising creative projects like documentaries](https://decrypt.co/76349/ethereum-documentary-fundraise) among other things. Finally, some of the internets original source code, discussed in the first section of this article, was sold for $5.4 million dollars as an NFT. The list goes on.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cyxOmhp-FioO7yfC8qneFn4Qu5E28r7F9IYhR3RXDJHe90QRFnapvpc1QodQaKWpRgZmbT5Tg6JtYhZaz26-XRe0Hv4E175_bZIwc1FIhcfSXzCmhmUzdFK1YqKG50GUuMVR4_Y4T8yk2a-7cA)\n\nEven digital media in general is just scratching the surface of NFT use-cases. NFTs can be programmed with arbitrary functionality. For example, NFTs can be used to give access to online communities like private Discord servers, or be used to access in-person events. Also, NFTs allow artists to capture royalties on secondary sales of their artwork without any legal contracts. The NFTs can be programmed in such a way that a percentage of secondary sales are automatically sent to the artist’s wallet address. We are just in the beginning stages of NFT experimentation – it’s not hard to imagine future use-cases where NFTs serve as our digital identities, or digital belongings that we carry with us through the Metaverse.\n\nThis brings us to the end of the Web3 Token module of the [Web3 Design Course 2022](http://designweb3.io/). We learned how Web3 tokens are a disruptive force in that they incentivize open-source protocol develop, and align the economic interests of all stakeholders on cryptonetworks. These tokens are often sold to raise funds for the development of Web3 projects; however, the SEC considers this the sale of unregistered securities so we will see the rollout of regulatory frameworks to deal with Web3 tokens. Finally, there are two main types of Web3 tokens: fungible and non-fungible (NFTs). We are still in the early days of what these tokens are capable of. Many brilliant entrepreneurs are experimenting with various use-cases.\n\nIn the next course modules we will be doing deep-dives into the Web3 ecosystem. Everything before this has been meant to prepare you for understanding Web3 product categories like DeFi, Cryptomedia, Creator Tools, Social Media, Digital Identity, Data & AI/ML, GameFi, Metaverse, and Autonomous Organizations.

[Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\n\nThe previous three design course modules ([1](https://www.designweb3.io/web3-design-course-2022/), [2](https://www.designweb3.io/blockchain-design-course-2022/), [3](https://www.designweb3.io/design-for-open-source-web3-projects-crypto-design-trends-2022/)) cover important background information on Web3. Now, we enter the Web3 ecosystem, starting with Decentralized Finance (DeFi). This article will quickly give UX Designers a quick understanding of what DeFi is, DeFi’s foundational products, and where DeFi is heading in the future. By the way – there’s also a video version of this article just below.\n\n[https://youtu.be/krC2hKzBMZg](https://youtu.be/krC2hKzBMZg)\n\nDeFi, or decentralized finance, refers to a complex ecosystem of dapps that offer financial services without the centralized intermediaries of traditional finance like banks, stock/bond brokers, and fintech companies. It offers foundational services – somewhat infrastructural – that the greater Web3 ecosystem can build on. These services include:\n\n* token swaps (Uniswap and Curve)\n* stablecoins for payments (MakerDAO and DAI)\n* lending/borrowing crypto (Compound)\n* automated fund managers (Yearn Finance)\n* dashboards (Zerion)\n\nJust like in traditional finance, DeFi users want to earn yield on their crypto to grow their assets. DeFi is the cutting-edge of fintech. In this course module we review the flagship protocols that have laid the foundations for a thriving DeFi ecosystem. These are some of the most mature and battle-tested dapps in the entire Web3 ecosystem. After discussing them, we move on and talk about the next wave of innovative protocols, called DeFi 2.0.\n\n## Swap tokens with Uniswap\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs) allow users to swap between different tokens. It’s a simple use-case, but one of the most foundational dapps in the Web3 ecosystem. Before, users had to temporarily give up custody of their tokens to a centralized exchange to make swaps. DEXs, on the other hand, facilitate token swaps with open-source smart contracts and no intermediaries. Uniswap is one of the most well-known DEXs – let’s see how it works.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ndf5LWq5RtxFbBIq8wYjcnx_XCdqmclwMgjL90YzcZmfVePJPXzkgWtM4LuqZk5-ebylJQc_2zKVq08ccX7Px3ul_YMzDy1xcjwVc-NBcUk0Xd-bwC4K-rqtwtUPDVmjyzxLDLbMGdK52clGlA)\n\n[Source](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet)\n\nAfter connecting their wallets, users select which token they want to swap from (Token A), and which token they want to swap to (Token B). Uniswap then calculates the exchange rate between this token pair. This tells users how many of Token B they should expect to receive. In the case above, I’m swapping .02 ETH for about 40 DAI, with an estimated network fee of $7.32. I will need to have extra ETH in my wallet to pay this network fee.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PKc1nb4ENtJjXkrhP_4ZH1ziekcyP0ie2SAS2Df_hb06_L-1woSykkIKsklT8wBWjD8llwFtDcYZ_LoQNQh99-LGPXI-QpGz7dWYDpBnpwmbykqUF1CKpRRipG9B_gnx1QICr9TUyw7OEN6nPw)\n\n[Source](http://coinbase.com/)\n\nNow let’s talk about what is happening under the hood. For example, where did the DAI come from that I swapped into? Decentralized exchanges use a different method than centralized exchanges for making these trades. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) use something called a central limit order book, or CLOB, to match buyers and sellers. Basically, buyers place bids for how much they are willing to pay for an asset, and sellers place bids for how much they are willing to sell an asset. The transaction is executed when there is overlap between the buy and sell bids. An order book for Bitcoin is shown above, where the green area represents buy orders, and the red sell orders.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y6VEGb08-vJEN2FP_CsIEN_PSKjJaF3-6kB7DNkYGElReX_b71KjwCQLhUdsnszlc_YL5t13TVjmcFobMDpGj65H0yJdzuS8nOZgT8J_tQcwtRABkobZFaqUexDqg6TsjznVpUluEIfZlYlS0g)\n\n[Source](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet)\n\nCLOBs are costly to run on-chain because they are transaction heavy and benefit from fast transaction processing. Thus, DEXs implement a different approach to token swaps. Every token pair you can swap on a DEX has a liquidity pool. So, in the example above, I made my swap using Uniswap’s ETH-DAI liquidity pool. We see $54.82M of tokens are locked in the ETH-DAI liquidity pool, made up of 23.81M DAI and 15.52k ETH. As users make swaps on these liquidity pools by depositing Token A and withdrawing Token B, an algorithm automatically recalculates the exchange rate for the token pair. These algorithms are known as “automated market makers”, or AMMs, and are responsible for updating token prices on DEXs based on supply and demand dynamics.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pQyS6lxI_lBT4pKtGKxIOHZcZF7fdTLWliEOT1m3ecmAe_BvfoBUKJIqNiwqXXRCGTV5XORGivJ6kBLkHRuGXn4ojU0mIy1CT6TtKIID0KblY2CieF5DaocLXI-XoGyrrypJGXp5BFerF0nAVw)\n\n[Source](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet)\n\nNow, where do the tokens in the liquidity pools initially come from? Liquidity providers (LPs) are other Web3 users who want to earn yield on their tokens. Uniswap charges a trading fee (0.3%) on each swap, and this trading fee is distributed to the liquidity providers for that pool. LPs deposit Token A and Token B into a liquidity pool, and receive LP tokens in return. At any point, users can burn their LP tokens for their initial liquidity plus whatever trading fees have accrued to them.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1kAlRJiRHwQKpGJtYJUk_XfTTT-tEqJy-N1htSrX3A5-7SoLMgp9zaEA3JzB3qeDyM7UEbqMitjYyPzpd-PBxIom3xbfrHpG_aHinRp91R9cxSoqsDyUPGZfw7fCCg04GozC1yG4VL1I-d4fIA)\n\n[Source](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/core-concepts/pools)\n\nSo, those are the basics of DEXs. Liquidity providers deposit tokens into liquidity pools to earn trading fees. Traders use these liquidity pools to make token swaps. And, AMM algorithms reprice tokens within liquidity pools based on market conditions. Uniswap is not the only DEX out there. Other DEXs have been created that excel for different use-cases. For example, Balancer allows liquidity pools containing up to 8 different tokens, whereas Uniswap liquidity pools always contain only 2. And, Curve is a DEX focused on stablecoin swaps, resulting in [less slippage](https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-slippage-how-to-avoid-slippage-on-defi-exchanges#:\\~:text=But%20despite%20the%20massive%20upsides,quote%20price%20and%20paid%20cost.) and reduced risk of [impermanent loss](https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-impermanent-loss-9ac6795e5baa).\n\nSpeaking of stablecoins… The vast majority of Web3 tokens have volatile prices, but a subset of them, called stablecoins, are designed to maintain a stable price over time. This makes them more attractive as a medium of exchange compared to volatile tokens. As [Ryan Selkis puts it](https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2021.pdf), “no one wants to spend currency they believe will be worth 10% more tomorrow, and no one wants to accept currency they think could be worth 10% less tomorrow.” This leads into another foundational DeFi protocol, MakerDAO, which allows users to deposit their volatile tokens (e.g. ETH), and mint stablecoins for tax-free spending.\n\n## Mint stablecoins with MakerDAO\n\nIn the previous section, we swapped ETH for DAI stablecoins on Uniswap, but this is a secondary market for DAI. DAI is quite unique in how it is minted. DAI comes from a DeFi protocol called MakerDAO, where users deposit volatile assets into a Maker vault and then mint DAI stablecoins.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ajjefUWqo7Zi6vXuEsMnPOLyim1cXKxaBR5oonksxJvMZz2TzJv-6HnKOawN6dwvKyWHnxUo5VqmNanHmOXEsUZo_Em4CbVrZrFYiBIwwp55dR32pUGfrfqcEC2qwonRo0Z8HAWSFqVh87epBA)\n\n[Source](http://oasis.app/)\n\nThis is known as a collateralized-debt position (CDP), because the user borrows DAI against their collateral, and pays interest (i.e. “stability fee”) on the loan. In the picture above, users open a vault, deposit ETH into the vault, and then take out a DAI loan. The ETH is locked in the vault until users pay back the DAI loan, which is the principal amount plus whatever interest is owed.\n\nMakerDAO requires that the collateral deposit is worth more than the stablecoin loan. This is known as “over-collateralization”, and is necessary when using volatile assets as collateral. For example, let’s say you deposit 1 ETH (worth $3000), and take out $2000-worth of DAI – this makes for a collateralization ratio of 150% (i.e. over-collateralized). If the price of ETH drops by 20% the collateral is now worth $2400, changing the collateralization ratio to 120%. The vault would still be over-collateralized, but could soon be under-collateralized if the price of ETH continues to drop. In fact, in the ETH-B vault pictured above, MakerDAO automatically liquidates the collateral to pay back the DAI loan, and closes out the vault, when the collateralization ratio drops below 130% (i.e. “min collateralization ratio”).\n\nYou may wonder what the point of this is. If these vaults need to be over-collateralized, then you’re essentially borrowing with money you already have. Aren’t loans about spending money you don’t have? We may eventually see under-collateralized crypto loans as Web3 matures. At a minimum we would need verified Web3 identities in order to track who has defaulted on their loans and assign credit scores accordingly. But still, for now, there are beneficial use-cases for crypto-collateralized stablecoins.\n\nThese stablecoin loans allow users to go long their collateral asset, while unlocking a portion of its value, in the form of DAI stablecoins, which can be used for payment throughout the rest of the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nFor example, if I’m bullish on ETH, and believe it will 2x within a year, then I want to continue holding ETH. In fact, I want to accumulate as much ETH as possible, and certainly do not want to swap my ETH for a stablecoin. Swapping ETH for a stablecoin hurts me in two ways. First, it triggers a tax event, and I will have to pay capital gains on my ETH. Second, I lose exposure to ETH’s upside potential during a bull run. Instead, borrowing DAI against my ETH with a Maker vault does not trigger a tax event, allows me to keep ownership of my ETH, while also freeing up liquidity so I can make payments in the meantime.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ESpQma4cWq-JBs9i3gf5tqgFZJZ4qI6sEQh6K8ksCP5AiXKNWDGhzbKekSmDEs5A7MpZg9jTPH6qKxONMEjXDEWSzkLC_v3ji4ehB-n9xp0d6-Hhx033kVi-BBitOn4GuoM2V9cP0ytW8dWP1g)\n\n[Source](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fsjn-charts%2Fprice-chart%2FDAI-1622641047.7691.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cfdtrading.com%2Fmulti-collateral-dai-trend-may-be-changing-as-price-just-breached-above-its-20-day-moving-average%2F1109787%2F&tbnid=pkf61CR3fWgEjM&vet=12ahUKEwin-u3D4PP3AhXUbs0KHaecDEoQMygBegUIARC8AQ..i&docid=2ArDXUq5HSVNyM&w=4200&h=2400&q=DAI%20price%20chart%20regression%20line&ved=2ahUKEwin-u3D4PP3AhXUbs0KHaecDEoQMygBegUIARC8AQ)\n\nMakerDAO’s stablecoin, DAI, is decentralized and maintains its peg to the US dollar without reliance on reserves held by centralized entities, like USDT’s Tether and USDC’s Circle. Stable, decentralized assets are an important DeFi building block, and an open area of experimentation, which we’ll see [later on](#stable).\n\nYou can think of MakerDAO as a protocol for self-loans; however, another class of lending protocols exist, like AAVE and Compound, that support peer-to-peer token lending. Lending protocols like these are foundational to DeFi because they establish lending/borrowing interest rates for a variety of tokens. Now, Web3 tokens have a time-value aspect to them, just like risk-free interest rates for fiat currencies in traditional money markets.\n\n## **Lend crypto with Compound Finance**\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dMld7p17KNgmbAwHJcWfQt5nFXpnRnEhwCYd8r83xHwm1dVWsIlQNPJUYRpSnJ7biuk8F4nDosEcTWMCo3O8N8ITCl6Qgyf6t5zq4-Py7IjNtmg8-I9PuKY-LC_iRuAPmY94mxSNv83zltKpQw)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nCompound creates a peer-to-peer lending marketplace for a variety of Web3 tokens. Suppliers are paid interest for depositing their tokens into lending pools. This has become a popular passive income strategy for Web3 users in DeFi.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pbntsC08uhUOejmYf--sql7z7Bi_psVBM-05i6ohhEVjUDcPJwiFkekCBaUc9IpnHwgWgRMNqkOV9Rk_IRZYAF6JOumG6FfJMkSZWCBjoi_MQUZO7Z1berFg7B7GCcpeNXNrnBLkvpdJ3S0_1A)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nSimilar to how Uniswap liquidity providers receive LP tokens, Compound suppliers receive cTokens for depositing tokens into lending pools. At any point, users can burn their cTokens for their initial deposit, plus the interest that has accrued. For example, cETH represents ETH that is actively earning interest in Compound.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RJ25fYbqy6ttAWXYgGxgtmOidRCyLB61rn0K2f37HgXKEa_2IG9ZxbQMGNbx2N_PcWp3iaHlUoOwd-8zbgtP5gB-obSqlQsbUdf2izRVG31-ILxu96uosejG9OnXc2bYZzv9z_MoJefBQrw5Dg)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nOn the other end of things, borrowers take loans out on these lending pools. Borrowers first must supply tokens to a lending pool, and select to use the token as collateral for a loan.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jjUVtSBEaF58bZqWcmKs2J_GmXF0VYKOcvZ8CjFKLsn0RZJ0DpiYnhtdE_0qTiT5Py_ntjBc8eFmkFcfjoB7hSBtpEQgwYh2wmrjxcT-569s2I2elLi85advwtikQegU6YywGO23RX132s-dXw)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nJust like with MakerDAO, all Compound loans must be over-collateralized based on a collateral factor (similar to collateralization ratio). The collateral factor varies by token, but let’s say it’s 75%. It means I can only borrow up to 75% of the collateral I have deposited. So with $100-worth of Token A collateral, I can borrow at most $75-worth of Token B. This borrow limit is indicated to the user at the bottom of the modal (“Borrow Limit Used”) in the picture above. If the value of a borrower’s collateral drops then he is at risk of liquidation.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gFk_u30EGY9g4d7s5K4DHdWlOAL4HzqvPnaMXh0Zh6_pTdQAi5Z4qaliYye8vXY67geM4xqox4MkaKg6UUc7c7mJS2tZ8QW6RHg8lswcInDWfbSesAjmWrsu1v7qOpIBhn6hifXdv_1DAwwmeQ)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nTo close the position, borrowers repay the token loan back into the lending pool plus the interest payment they owe. Note that interest, for suppliers and borrowers, is paid in the token that is being lent/borrowed. Since I borrowed DAI in the example above, I made a small interest payment of DAI.\n\nCompound is powered by smart contracts that automatically set interest rates based on the liquidity of tokens in the lending pools. Tokens with lower liquidity will have higher interest rates, as supply and demand dictate. These are “floating” interest rates meaning they change over time. Compound calculates an interest rate for each lending pool at every Ethereum block.\n\nYou can see why liquidity is important here. The lower the token liquidity, the more it will cost to borrow the token. This issue of liquidity is a challenge for all DeFi protocols – token liquidity is required to get the protocol off the ground, and to continue offering a usable service. Generally, the more liquidity the better, so DeFi protocols compete to attract liquidity to their platform.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aoriaB2VNrmGx5L-MNrhqsybK1DYeYNsPCldFOx8Sq7CSyCHqyoPDu96UehuwNKoAni05A8o2K76wFbhFGth8KgU1jYhXyydDMucn6zZhhIlP71dwLMVkm04cpvFD2sywTf9H3zYdOElaBbuKA)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nSo how do DeFi protocols attract liquidity in the first place? Compound was the first to try out liquidity mining. Compound distributes COMP – its native governance token – to its current suppliers and borrowers. This strategy worked well for Compound, and other DeFi protocols followed suit, leading to an explosion in liquidity in summer of 2020 (i.e. DeFi Summer).\n\n## Liquidity mining to boost yield with Compound Finance\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ihUMkX5oqHMWzD9xO9C3aJR566uf7IjsoTk6Jg5RZ2dIXI3KtdidUZFr8dnjzrJf1jTufLv3VlbwdYIxfQuqcbejwD2EO9tRIQziIaQ11mp5sSGCVRVK89oWN83v9KbHJp5VLb0TQXerjM8OZg)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nNotice that suppliers on Compound are actually paid two interest rates. In the example above, where I’ve supplied ETH, one interest rate pays me back in ETH. This is from the interest paid by borrowers on their ETH loan. The other interest rate is paid in COMP. This is Compound’s liquidity mining reward, which is meant to incentivize me to keep my ETH liquidity locked in the protocol.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hIYY3Cfzliq9DmdbJMji0d5Y7dYc0_1EYrAgzYVRHwpSxHnRWe-_-OcqeM0h3jMszZCEJ8TAye9wyPn4lvW8hh4CNwm1xqF25qRHjNuz29DuZfHL_QtGba0bDLjB2WPbusuwG5izwd02g2RuFw)\n\n[Source](https://medium.com/compound-finance/expanding-compound-governance-ce13fcd4fe36)\n\nBack in 2020, Compound minted its COMP governance token with a fixed supply of 10M COMP. 4.2M COMP were allocated to its liquidity mining program, which distributes 1139 COMP tokens across its suppliers and borrowers on a daily basis. This will run for around four years until the allocated COMP runs out.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pWA6WnAn6ZsBcOLPH4dpRHLH7RDgzngvBIIU_2xLnzhxycrjPR30JywC1eRLHIkulJhxwNqhnsraLGXlK3X2kii0nteB1vxsd_2UZHwl3Nl5JnWdO7r2vj2U3jEzlBAw_OljeHlUzBfsvRZdqg)\n\n[Source](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/governance?)\n\nCompound was the first to implement liquidity mining, but many other DeFi protocols followed suit, using their own governance tokens as reward. These tokens give holders the ability to vote on governance proposals that could be anything from technical improvements to adjusting protocol parameters like interest rates and the list of assets approved for collateral (e.g. MakerDAO). Discussing protocol governance leads to the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This is an entire course module in itself that will be covered later. For now, understand that DeFi governance tokens have real-world value as they are traded on secondary markets, seen in the picture above.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vDEvlwRtrOmx7aa9smdAGD7VuThHGE_8hJFicXsg3xfzDyZucXnLnJfxvr7my7F8YKlZc9nn4L9MmLera6zUsLmbPbpj0p5X_nc0O1cb_HoQkGZ4m0KoQZWoOlKRqO_-6lIjb0J7w-d-QXPUCw)\n\n[Source](https://defillama.com/)\n\nCompound launched its liquidity mining program in June 2020. Other liquidity mining programs cascaded from there, leading to a boom known as “DeFi Summer”. Liquidity flooded into DeFi protocols as yields increased across the entire ecosystem. Look at the increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) in the chart above. The TVL chart shows all the token liquidity “locked” in all of the  DeFi protocols on Ethereum. This could be tokens in DEX liquidity pools, Maker vaults, lending pools, and more. TVL is a great metric for comparing the health of DeFi protocols (e.g. AAVE versus Compound), as well as entire DeFi ecosystems (e.g. Ethereum DeFi versus Solana DeFi).\n\nSo far we’ve talked about several ways of earning yield on Web3 tokens, such as becoming a liquidity provider on a DEX, supplying tokens to lending pools, and participating in liquidity mining programs. In the next section we discuss another DeFi yield activity – staking – and show how DeFi users stack multiple yield activities on top of one another to maximize yield. This is known as yield farming.\n\n## Yield farming with Curve Finance\n\nStaking is the idea of locking tokens to receive other additional token rewards, paid out over time. This is an odd idea at first, but locking tokens in stake pools can be beneficial to DeFi protocols – let’s look at why this might be.\n\nRemember back to the first section how users receive LP tokens for depositing their tokens in a DEX liquidity pool. Not only is it important for DEXs to initially attract liquidity, but they also must retain liquidity to maintain good UX for its users. Some DEXs encourage users to stake their LP tokens in order to receive additional incentives.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WGrvwEeUBaoIrUhyvh7LDQ7QAbztMVpAsnrKY6-EMdGYIvIBywtz4Z8gan66MU6n-IgGyFH_CPIJAuikbq5KVoyd8tVDbMoHJYMWxxBDQjdazVwNRUBOZIYy4feT1dQhW-keYxHXNOaxHDx8tA)\n\n[Source](https://curve.fi/)\n\nCurve is a DEX for stablecoin swaps that offers this kind of LP token staking. Liquidity providers deposit tokens into a Curve liquidity pool, and receive Curve LP tokens. These LP tokens can be staked in Curve Gauge Pools where the user receives regular payouts of CRV tokens. Users are unable to remove their liquidity so long as their LP tokens are staked, and they are receiving CRV rewards. Do you see how this incentivizes users to keep their liquidity on Curve?\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nP56EN9LEujNel_jPA3BQKW0HFnxpvf3LE1KCVNEabzgLxe6hvQb0mmidNMaoA8nxyF6SKOF6W3ulQMyyatwBylhaJrbebW8RJG809jHJrc4SwG7pM9ble8APKTKld0XDYNNRKxkU87j6Heiww)\n\n[Source](https://curve.fi/)\n\nStaking increases yield for Curve liquidity providers. For example, in the first Curve liquidity pool above (“tricrypto2”), the yield is 1.89% from the pool’s trading fees; however, users receive additional yield – anywhere from 4.23% to 10.59% – paid in CRV tokens. This means, if I deposit $100-worth of liquidity in the pool, I’d expect to earn $1.89-worth of trading fees, plus $4.23-worth of CRV, annually.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WpzXL5usNBsOHsSMwIghgUNxZBFYi0oAoQXwJXCcYj637YDZC9Rws7XhfGXBSUefjL2YgAPQPefbKCUNB3WpUkvmWYpn187q5dntNQe6lzvTbtCbMeMQCH6Z2KL8o4eZYqqif45Zd7VcHVzaag)\n\n[Source](https://curve.fi/)\n\nThings do not end here on Curve. It has additional staking opportunities. Users can stake CRV in the Curve DAO for veCRV in return. veCRV is the governance token, so it allows users to make Curve governance decisions; however, it also boosts CRV rewards by up to 2.5x, which is veCRVs main draw. That’s why the CRV APYs – shown two images above – are displayed as a range (e.g. +4.23% – 10.59% CRV). Looking at the image above, CRV is time-locked anywhere from one week to four years. This takes CRV off the market, making it a deflationary asset, which some believe has led to its favorable price performance compared to other DeFi tokens.\n\nAre you starting to see how yields can be stacked on top of each other? On Curve, users can deposit tokens into a liquidity pool to earn trading fees. They can then stake their LP tokens to earn CRV rewards. And then stake their CRV tokens to boost their CRV rewards. This is what “yield farming” is all about – stacking yield to maximize return on investment.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3sBouB8yTPTHmknyOqabv6TAo0RmdNmAWIFJUyLzdS3FL-13dlY_sTlaMweMpuF5Jz2_0u4EvBvwtlk93xq6yMcEeaiG8gPk5T3uWjE2Q-6irB0bRyer1RbFaHf19Ho8qWoXcBEv25Dhrkal4Q)\n\n[Source](https://curve.fi/)\n\nBut all this makes my head spin. The yield farming I’ve described here is complex, manual, and costly. For example, CRV rewards accumulate over time and users must manually claim CRV on Curve’s UI (image above), which requires a transaction and costs a network fee. Yield aggregators – another class of DeFi dapps – solve these problems by automating yield farming for users. Users’ funds are pooled together in vaults that follow pre-programmed yield farming strategies designed for efficiency and maximal return.\n\n## Automated investing with Yearn Finance\n\nYearn Finance was one of the first yield aggregators. On Yearn, DeFi experts propose yield farming strategies and implement them as Yearn vaults that Web3 users can deposit tokens into. Essentially, these vaults aggregate a lot of tokens, and deploy them to various DeFi protocols, sharing the yield with its depositors (i.e. yToken holders).\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/y_WUIL4p4Jb1yP3sUNdbNS-36iiH9J0Xd1uhwYrhM2TcOfOS8wuqXE-OTqYbEUM9zPzvV8HqYQ8m_sYFg-RmItZi3c7TQ3iUEkbILjCbilnDUDbp-GmZ74cayOw4sjZuaxYXaDAgPsR_ZUrVKQ)\n\n[Source](https://www.designweb3.io/defi-for-ux-designers-web3-design-bootcamp-2022/.finance/#/vaults)\n\nYearn vaults generally accept Curve LP tokens, and automate the yield farming process from here, such as moving tokens into different lending protocols in pursuit of the highest interest rate. Or, stake the LP tokens in other protocols, and automatically recycle the rewards back into the vault for a compounding effect.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P7h4rP4bhqH5nZ9Grx2iDMX1396B6_IPVTqszcEY5i80UYqpxqOoILDwRRh7-pRk3BF6DnAPpzdgLS8YjEz0u04rxPixL8NEl--MQFPBTOJGoPO-2V6Wpab84Q915UV2vLYZ4ebstLm7iSYDSA)\n\n[Source](https://yearn.finance/#/vault/0x3B96d491f067912D18563d56858Ba7d6EC67a6fa)\n\nThis brings us to a concept called “token composability”, which is at the heart of yield farming. Essentially, Web3 tokens are interoperable with other protocols. DeFi tokens can be used throughout the DeFi ecosystem in order to stack rewards.\n\nLet’s look at Yearn’s “Curve USDN” vault strategy. Users deposit crvUSDN tokens into this Yearn vault. Yearn then stakes these LP tokens in another DeFi protocol, Convex Finance, to earn CRV and CVX. As the vault earns tokens, Yearn automatically harvests them and converts them into more crvUSDN, which it cycles back into Convex Finance. This automation simplifies yield farming for users, and reduces their network fees. They only need to send two transactions: one to deposit tokens into a vault, and the other to withdraw tokens from the vault.\n\nAt this point in the article, we’ve discussed all the major DeFi building blocks:  tokens swaps,  minting stablecoins, lending/borrowing, staking, and yield farming. This all takes place across different protocols, often requiring the user to visit multiple web apps. This can make the DeFi ecosystem feel scattered. DeFi dashboards bring everything together for a more seamless UX. Let’s look at how dashboards take advantage of the open-source nature of Web3 to stitch DeFi protocols together into one dApp.\n\n## DeFi dashboard with Zerion & Zapper\n\nDeFi dashboards provide the user access to multiple DeFi protocols all from one UI. The first way to think of these dashboards is that they extend wallet functionality. Popular browser extension wallets like MetaMask have small UIs with limited feature sets like viewing token balances and sending tokens to other wallets.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Lo5xVyBEgU03fhvvCtt1D0FooOkr3zYzfKqpppoOqvGi6Mwf6RbuNoCTgipyXX_2IqBtRYvBJKHpP9Tz4uGhhhRTGGd9u22AWeI_fu_nRy7zkjoxWd4JQomVfbg5jqDvrIc5u2z8kT9Q8_bGWw)\n\n[Source](https://zerion.io/)\n\nHowever, users can connect their wallet to a dashboard like Zerion to view their wallet as an asset portfolio, not just simple token balances. These portfolio views help users see how their wallet’s value changes over time. Also, Zapper allows users to bundle multiple wallets together so they can track the combined value of multiple wallets.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/S8Io25NHVGZEpXZeuFLxZGjf6CqXe3gtisABlIjkiLfYUurJ8jWaduEbXql66SCTxI72MW3hwbeTTEcp65dFPpH1OFR6cUdzDwyF51iOa4znK2locEPC_zyK9_b1jB4zrRI6DSr67wlLYIdvNw)\n\n[Source](https://zapper.fi/)\n\nDashboards also directly integrate multiple DeFi protocols into one UI. This is an example of open-source software composability. Web3 protocols are open-source so other projects can use them as building blocks in their own dApp. This is juxtaposed to the proprietary APIs of Web2 applications. Users can search for the best yields across the entire DeFi ecosystem, and directly deposit tokens into lending protocols (AAVE and Compound), liquidity pools (Curve, Sushi Swap, Uniswap), staking pools (Curve and Convex), and yield aggregator vaults (Yearn and Harvest). All accessed from Zapper’s “invest” tab.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q2WE_eWzohgYWuBPvBs_EA3KbHhuSJhfqBuP5w6I5tBHKqb9OzkhjkhTOwtH7-pWdIAF9dXGwsmIHjvPfY77xT-CWVsAS_M0BWzqBC9dtFGClV9tkeRNepQO_Ib3MHe0PORA1oJzfxYZjDLa6g)\n\n[Source](http://zerion.io/)\n\nThese dashboards are packed full of other useful features. For example, the Zerion dashboard has “swap” functionality that searches across multiple DEXs to find the best exchange rate to execute a token swap. This is called a DEX aggregator, and is a convenience utility for Web3 users.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/N7nu-04R2vjjeqnfLgTv0gme2OKXDqj5_3ftfGXGtPk4HKTfUTk5KD-RVSS9qyWAAlrS-GCxpSeRLna30bArDP4_nGgMi8_rBbuo2crJqWSpObdyO8y_9TaDXYzKT_XdWjQNcAzBtcN_dlRqyQ)\n\n[Source](http://zerion.io/)\n\nThe thesis that we will live in a multi-chain world continues to be proven correct. More and more, people will use multiple blockchain networks, and will increasingly want to transact tokens between these cryptonetworks. Blockchain interoperability has a long way to go and Web3 ecosystems feel siloed; however, dashboards are well positioned to improve the UX here.\n\nZapper tracks the value of a user’s portfolio across 11 different cryptonetworks (all EMV-compatible). And, Zerion aggregates blockchain bridges so that users can transfer tokens to other Layer 1 cryptonetworks (BSC, Avalanche, Fantom), Ethereum Layer 2s (Optimism, Arbitrum), and sidechains (Polygon), all from one UI.\n\nSo that wraps up the first wave of DeFi from token swaps to dashboards. There are other protocols I consider slightly less foundational than what we’ve covered, but the curious reader may be interested to look into some of them. DeFi Derivatives platforms allow users to trade advanced financial instruments like options (Opyn), perpetuals (DyDx & Perp), and synthetic assets (Synthetix). Also, there are token index funds that diversify a single investment across multiple tokens (see Index CoOp). This is the same idea as ETF’s and mutual funds in traditional markets. Finally, there are insurance protocols that protect users from things like impermanent loss, and DeFi smart contract exploits (see Nexus Mutual).\n\n## DeFi 2.0 & Stablecoin Wars\n\nInterest rates have been at all time lows in traditional markets over the past several years as the U.S. 10 Year Treasury Bond hit 0.60% APY in 2020. At the same time, DeFi was on the rise, giving investors alternative markets to earn much higher (albeit riskier) yields. All the DeFi products we’ve talked about were some of the first to find product-market fit in Web3, evidenced by the fact that they onboarded millions of users onto Ethereum; however, like any first iteration of technology, there exist some problems in the current DeFi ecosystem. Let’s discuss some of the problems facing DeFi 1.0, and peer into the emerging DeFi 2.0 landscape, which seeks to address them – starting with stablecoins.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kbty10E9jy4VOk2fpa9wPHhTaPblAqtaGzk2WJSsZxkxZlq-Jk36dPztj_6Biio7kkdU_eAdIASfafrRTaayTMltHgYfcueMe7SuEUoMBUBzEVtrF1X36Dl0H4MvjNgU40bHnd5gD84Ml9iDlw)\n\n[Source](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins)\n\nDemand for stablecoins is rapidly increasing as the Web3 ecosystem is more and more in need of non-volatile assets for things like payment. There are many types of stablecoins each with their pros and cons. And it’s also an active area of experimentation as entrepreneurs search for optimal stablecoin designs. Let’s take a look at the different stablecoin categories.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/a8fDAH9e7HsZjmTLOjx-zUms0CGbs7rB_CIclCUiWpVjB3kOr79ajJ8FyI5HQJkB73bCHVSdlVXAO-ptUDVkzmcxkdZkqBZvskq9P_4Pz7gidI2Ui6uKvG74BE7XtZBQ8iyGE2JK9LkcgOnppA)\n\n[Source](source:)\n\nThe first category is fiat-collateralized stablecoins. These are, by far, the most popular right now based on market cap. Here, regulated companies, like Tether and Circle, issue stablecoins that are fully-backed by their fiat reserves. USDC and USDT are pegged to the US-dollar, but some stablecoins track other currencies (e.g. EURS). Historically, fiat-collateralized stablecoins have maintained their peg better than others; however, their fiat reserves are custodied within the traditional financial system. Governments have the ability to seize these reserves and undermine fiat-collateralized stablecoins, which many consider unacceptable for a means of payment in the world of Web3.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_xBivLVJB54CvAclb7eGL2vDOzbMugURgHocOMEfdWr-xHhiF1Fyt_XivFScoD3dOCFQQvheGccvakePsSGuG4vsTGBuIAFtGBMeA7chM-lNVgtgsmYQfR5leNkUN-KJ-t4NNZ2oFAHnh7Y26g)\n\n[Source](http://pexels.com/)\n\nEnter crypto-collateralized stablecoins. This brings us back to [MakerDAO](#maker) where users can deposit crypto into Maker vaults and mint DAI – a stablecoin also pegged to the US-dollar. This is a big deal, because the crypto collateral backing the stablecoins cannot be seized by centralized entities. Thus, crypto-collateralized stablecoins are truly decentralized; however, the problem is that crypto is volatile, and using it as collateral is risky because the value of collateral can quickly fall below the loan’s value. Therefore, crypto-collateralized stablecoins must be over-collateralized, which isn’t an efficient use of capital.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y_5YSx9USftSN19miF4VRx3WLQlZVZTU9WUPH-HMyd9BASljkwHyNpvOqyvt_jhofmnnISVnSuBKRhayMlnrrmjO4PngfLgXmCtG4yJ5-dc6koDDJQ5x3AXlsRXGjSSkeNwNyxW60FuqSoV78Q)\n\n[Source](https://alchemix.fi/)\n\nMakerDAO was the first crypto-collateralized stablecoin protocol. Since then, other DeFi protocols have iterated on, and improved the original MakerDAO concept. For example, the crypto locked in Maker vaults is just sitting there, not earning yield. On Alchemix, users deposit crypto collateral to generate alUSD – Alchemix’s stablecoin. But here, Alchemix deposits collateral into Yearn Vaults that earn interest, which is used to automatically repay the user’s alUSD loan. It’s a self-repaying loan. Similarly, Abracadabra.Money supports yield-bearing tokens as collateral, like Yearn (e.g. yvDAI) and Convex (e.g. cvx3pool) tokens. But I digress – let’s move onto the third stablecoin category – algorithmic stablecoins.\n\nThe first two stablecoin categories are asset-backed. Either fiat reserves, or crypto collateral in vaults, support the price of the aforementioned stablecoins. A lot of recent experimentation has been done on algorithmic stablecoins, which have no assets backing them. An algorithm automatically maintains the peg of a stablecoin based on real-time market conditions for that stablecoin. This is usually done through mint and burn mechanics. Let’s pause and talk about the most popular algorithmic stablecoin – UST.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/U7NYeDDmApwAAbaRBj5ntdTJ2QvxNgf4fryEYba3PjHNQPUV0OzltvQV0Tce3OciOuNUzhJuCzeYAy81QgI7EP7V7fX_QFmgFZM0f5SC-aBKqo-4wNuTZt_pSF-9hUCKaMIUTpv_hDag5qk2eQ)\n\n[Source](http://cointelegraph.com/)\n\nUST is built on the Terra blockchain, and is pegged to the US-dollar. UST is paired with Terra’s native token – LUNA, which is a volatile crypto asset. UST and LUNA can be exchanged in a 1:1 ratio with each other. At any point, 1 UST can be minted by burning $1-worth of LUNA. Alternatively, 1 UST can be burned in exchange for $1-worth of LUNA. Arbitrageurs utilize this mint-burn mechanism when UST is trading on centralized exchanges for a premium, or at a discount. For example, let’s say UST breaks its peg, and trades at $1.02 on a CEX. Arbitrageurs can burn $1-worth of LUNA, and mint UST in order to realize a 2% gain. On the other hand, if UST is trading at $.98, then it can be exchanged for $1-worth of LUNA. This is how UST maintains its peg.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/i0b6h4k3Ku2Fp78vOkx8WFoUzpyGTunyxCnPyy9nXNxpZuNxI5WW4t7FIW5-fhz6jx0-_mfM9bcXlQ3b4_trqDILJQsfo1UZ98HR4BmsJtgGcAUaaZu7zb4XgcYLCiBRsCMyJ5nD5df3yadTmg)\n\n[Source](http://coinbase.com/)\n\nHowever, it’s ironic that I’m writing this now. Just last week UST failed massively. There was a major sell-off in UST as investors lost faith, reflexivity kicked in, and caused an even greater sell-off. Billions of dollars of UST were liquidated over several days, and UST is sitting at around $.09 at the time of writing. This points to the immaturity of algorithmic stablecoins, and puts into question the feasibility of algorithmic stablecoins in general.\n\nThere is another category of stablecoin – fractional reserve stablecoins – that is a middle ground between algorithmic and crypto-collateralized. These stablecoins are partially crypto-collateralized hence the term “fractional reserve”, and partially rely on an algorithm to maintain their peg. FRAX is the most popular example of fractional reserve stablecoins.\n\nAll the stablecoins we’ve discussed so far are pegged to fiat currencies. The issue with this is that pegged stablecoins are beholden to central banks that control the monetary policies of fiat currencies. Some argue it’s unacceptable to have any reliance on central institutions in the decentralized Web3 ecosystem. The final category of stablecoins we talk about is non-pegged stablecoins. OlympusDAO is the most popular project in this space with its non-pegged OHM stablecoin.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dLKK4mWyZmBUVUhfa5iXhcD7cvmCyyd-Ew29ywtAU25MW9-tCd8uluu1bozAxPANFeM0hLHuhmSyI5AsmGh1YrCtvFmt9laGH6DlM3bb-LYX-spS6Z4AQoNDLS7eysLq5SaiJmv7hyxK0orZiw)\n\n[Source](https://app.olympusdao.finance/?_gl=1\\*1y30td0\\*_ga\\*MTQ1OTQ5ODEzNS4xNjUyOTk5MDA5\\*_ga_QV7HNEEHV9\\*MTY1MzI0NTIzMC41LjAuMTY1MzI0NTIzMC4w#/dashboard)\n\n“Stablecoin” is a bit of a misnomer for OHM. Currently, its price is around $17 – and it’s been as high as $1,300+. So OHM can be highly volatile, but one of the main features of OHM is its floor price, or risk-free value. Users exchange crypto with OlympusDAO for discounted OHM in a process called bonding. All bonded crypto is held in OlympusDAO’s treasury, which ensures a floor price of at least $1 OHM. Thus, the value of OHM is free-floating, but users can always have faith in the floor price, backed by Olmypus’ war chest.\n\nThis leads into the next problem that DeFi 2.0 is attempting to solve – that of deep, permanent token liquidity. OlympusDAO controls a massive treasury, which is a great example of an upcoming concept – “protocol controlled value” (PCV). The protocol can deploy liquidity as it sees fit to ensure liquidity for its native token, or to earn yield and grow the treasury larger. Also, their protocols can rent out their liquidity to help other protocols bootstrap token trading, or bolster their liquidity pools.\n\n## Deep liquidity with OlympusDAO\n\nWe know that liquidity is important in all aspects of DeFi. Without tokens in liquidity pools you can’t make swaps on DEXs, borrow tokens in lending protocols, and enact automated yield farming strategies. Without liquidity DeFi grinds to a halt. And the more liquidity the better. For example, the more liquidity in a DEXs liquidity pool, the less slippage users are subjected to when making token swaps. That’s why DeFi protocols compete with one another to attract liquidity, and increase the TVL of their protocol.\n\nLiquidity mining, first seen with Compound in 2020, attempted to overcome the liquidity bootstrapping challenge. Protocols mint their governance token, and distribute it incrementally as a reward to its liquidity providers. Unfortunately, this only solves the liquidity problem in the short-term. Liquidity mining programs attract mercenary capital. Without loyalty to any single protocol, users switch their liquidity between protocols whenever higher interest rates popup elsewhere. It’s difficult for protocols to maintain this liquidity, and they have to continue inflating their governance token in order to do so. But more and more, liquidity is managed at the protocol-level, called “protocol controlled liquidity” or “protocol owned liquidity”.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/feMv6VPozdjdTvzpKqZ9tPKHtmnsUYe33dH7NItAU1NISlYa8h6pPAckhB87TBoyQeQHmghZiorjv9IRD_l9B3_85kOaXVyGV5iWnvV7LqIer3GWIgCdHmDTfYEVeS8SUrLhVhtcNL2Ul_l3mQ)\n\n[Source](https://app.olympusdao.finance/?_gl=1\\*1y30td0\\*_ga\\*MTQ1OTQ5ODEzNS4xNjUyOTk5MDA5\\*_ga_QV7HNEEHV9\\*MTY1MzI0NTIzMC41LjAuMTY1MzI0NTIzMC4w#/dashboard)\n\nDeFi 1.0 protocols do not own user liquidity. Users own their LP tokens, and can redeem them for the underlying liquidity at any time. This is changing in DeFi 2.0. Let’s go back to OlympusDAO, and users bonding their crypto in the treasury. Here, user crypto is exchange for discounted OHM. In this case, the users no longer own their liquidity – the liquidity is now permanently held in OlympusDAO treasury. In fact, OlympusDAO controls over 99% of its liquidity in DEXs (e.g. OHM-FRAX LP & OHM-DAI LP).\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YEfsBVnZOYCFEduWnnVJCjj_LuVtVQ1r6u-85HUH5cbDz0pywAwbisMfwj8kTR9bC7oN3Xwc7I63toVPxiJ7y3QIzq6JweWxqDU_Xf5dPvzFBaU0ewwNC2qcXH58qyvFg9vuIYzvCjn31dRYzQ)\n\n[Source](https://app.olympusdao.finance/?_gl=1\\*1y30td0\\*_ga\\*MTQ1OTQ5ODEzNS4xNjUyOTk5MDA5\\*_ga_QV7HNEEHV9\\*MTY1MzI0NTIzMC41LjAuMTY1MzI0NTIzMC4w#/dashboard)\n\nThis ensures that the liquidity remains in place so that users can trade in and out of OHM, with low slippage. Also, the protocol earns almost all of the liquidity pool trading fees, and is becoming a large holder of SUSHI, which all work to further grow the protocol.\n\nFrax Protocol is another good example of PCV. Users mint FRAX stablecoin by depositing their crypto assets into Frax protocol’s reserves. Frax Protocol applies automated market operations (AOMs) on its reserves for a variety of reasons. For example, its collateral investor AMO moves USDC reserves into lending protocols like Compound and Yearn, which earns interest. Another AMO provides FRAX liquidity on exchanges like Curve and Uniswap to ensure deep liquidity pools for FRAX-stablecoin pairs. Fei Protocol is similar – the protocol controls reserves for yield farming strategies to grow its reserves, as well as to provide FEI liquidity on Uniswap.\n\nThese protocols can also rent out their liquidity to other DeFi protocols, known as liquidity-as-a-service (LaaS). Tokemak is a great example of this. Essentially, individual liquidity providers deposit tokens into reactors, and liquidity directors (LDs) rent out this liquidity to various DEXs. LD’s create liquidity on-demand – they vote on which token reactors get paired together, and which DEXs to send these token pairs to. Of course, Tokemak earns DEX trading fees, which its building up a treasury with. This treasury, controlled by TOKE governance, will be utilized for additional LaaS operations in the future. Tokemak is like a liquidity aggregator, supplying liquidity to other specific areas in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/suLBeT0mtfw6y-9oQIWMyqDp3QtD7cd9D1uKystaS97A4w_fgny2qIRrHiUWVYI3plEZSUeT0klhWgsfNCAdBjOTWVEEmdPHa-tpWkISQfUwwLUhGfqM808KQECc2Ek_yzPNNSqnl9ju6c0AZg)\n\n[Source](https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympus-pro-introducing-fantom-cohort-1-launch-partners-b4ff40f78538)\n\nFinally, LaaS is being used to help other up-and-coming protocols launch their native token. Before, to start sellings a token on a DEX you either needed to seed the liquidity pool with a lot of up front capital, or attract users to bring their own liquidity. This brings us back to liquidity mining, which we’ve already established is ineffective in the long run. However, now, OlympusDAO launched a product called Olympus Pro, which generalizes its token bonding mechanism for other protocols. For example, users can bond their LP tokens in exchange for the protocol’s discounted governance token. Now that protocol owns the LP tokens, so the liquidity will remain in place without continuous liquidity mining. This is known as “protocol pwned liquidity” (POL).\n\nAlso, FEI and FRAX have partnered with Ondo Finance, which provides liquidity pools to protocols looking to list their governance token in an IDO – initial DEX offering. The protocol deposits its governance token in a pool, which is matched by either FRAX or FEI stablecoins. The Frax and Fei protocols earn 5% APR on the liquidity it provides. This is like renting out stablecoin liquidity so that other protocols can quickly get up and running selling their governance tokens.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nI, Travis Kassab, am not a financial advisor, tax professional, broker, or legal advisor.

[Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\n\nIn the previous [Blockchain Design Course](https://www.designweb3.io/blockchain-design-course-2022/) module we talked about blockchains – the technology that underlies Web3. These are sometimes referred to as Layer 1 protocols. Blockchain protocols defines how nodes communicate, and come to consensus, with each other in order to form a functioning cryptonetwork. Everything is centered around the cryptonetwork’s native Web3 token. In this article we will about about Web3 tokens in general: both utility and security tokens, as well as fungible and non-fungible tokens. Web3 tokens change the game as far as open-source software development goes – the future is bright! This article is an extension of the [Web3 Design Course 2022](http://designweb3.io/).\n\nBy the way – there’s also a video version of this article (see below).\n\n[https://youtu.be/AkuZavstg_s](https://youtu.be/AkuZavstg_s)\n\n## Billions Rely on Internet Protocols Everyday\n\nSoftware protocols have been crucial in the development of information technologies. Billions of users everyday rely on internet protocols to access the web. These internet protocols dictate how networked computers request and share information with each other. Let’s take a look back at how these protocols developed, and where we are currently in terms of the development of the internet as a whole.\n\nThe internet is simply a network of connected computers. Once computers are physically connected in a network, software protocols standardize how these computers share data with one another. This includes rule sets for locating other computers on the network, sending data packets to a desired location, and checking that messages were received and correctly interpreted. These internet protocols can be broken into four layers:\n\n1. Hardware protocols\n2. Internet Protocol (i.e. IP)\n3. Transmission Control Protocol (i.e. TCP)\n4. Application Protocols (e.g. HTTP)\n\nHypertext Transmission Protocol (HTTP) is an important application protocol. HTTP defines how a computer requests data from, and serves data to, another computer. A common example is for a computer to request an HTML file from a web server (using an HTTP GET request) in order to view a web page on its internet browser.\n\nThis HTTP GET request then gets passed down one layer to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which tells the computer how to break the message into smaller data packets that will be sent one by one to the web server. TCP is also used by the web server receiving the data packets in order to assemble the data packets back into the original message.\n\nThe Internet Protocol (IP) ensures that the data packets reach their intended destination. Before sending the HTTP GET message via TCP, the IP wraps data packets with an IP address corresponding to the web server. This is like the “To:” field on a mail envelope. Finally, hardware protocols convert the data packets into electrical signals that get transmitted through the internet’s physical infrastructure (e.g. cables, modems, routers).\n\nOn the other end, the web server will send back an HTML file using the same HTTP and TCP/IP process described above. Now you have a rough idea of how the web functions with a set of open-source internet protocols. These protocols were developed by independent researchers and non-profit organizations, and haven’t been modified much since the mid-1990’s. All of the web products we enjoy today would not exist without these internet protocols.\n\n## The Internet is Still Evolving\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/AA87N2dwmm8AHdgb8pltzVpiFmLAITtmznbnHrhAPoniJx8T1cDEk6dxrjkFIe6hKtt5Tx_BLwFG9bwz2jMyjonFB1Htk25G7T4R_YU2shLVMYcYj9ywK1rsdfYtbgjrpENYQDj2y_4LL8ZuIg)\n\nThis is a good point to talk about the evolution of the internet. We can break the internet’s development into three phases: Web1, Web2, and Web3.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QEbHXWaBY4nYwGVXXbPKoDJQl5NTqyY30o1S3ZTjlo_X2Tlf2OKuUpktWDFFKPg6Aoz2HZpU09QR4YQZYc10Vt-zBYHG-bu8WCEFvXFy1YPsgfzH-65Jk8DebO6ejhyOW1dG7tW_)\n\nWeb1 is characterized as “read-only” because only a few entities published content for consumption by many. The internet was thought of at this time as a digital encyclopedia. Users accessed static web pages containing text, images, and hyperlinks; however, there was little interactivity for end-users other than consumption.\n\nThis brings us to Web2, which is also referred to as the “social web”. Online communities and identities began to emerge at this time. Web2 is especially characterized by social media platforms, and the idea of user-generated content. Now everyone had the ability to create content, build a social network, and react to the posts of others (e.g. like and share buttons). The web went from a few content creators to billions. If Web1 is considered “read-only” then Web2 can be considered “read-write” for the average user. Centralized web platforms attracted users with large networks and simple user experiences.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6TdqseOLkpK-AJksy5DNv4Ye8wy3wGAJPS2CSIkqTSY8ja5IuVjkOcmN-9iH9XRyk5tffqkORvARMU8tgokeitttmGMCZDhlZV5guvFTqb3L7UZekQKcJjftHFqQx84IvQLcC4KH)\n\nThis has ended in a winner-take-all dynamic. There are several monopoly-like companies, such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook, that largely control how the internet is experienced by end-users. For example, users must agree to the terms and conditions of these centralized companies if they want to participate in the dominant social network. Also, Web2 companies have the rights to all the user data generated on these platforms, which they mine and sell to advertisers. Roughly 98% of Facebook’s revenue is generated in this way. It’s a strange idea that we’ve become accustomed to – that users who join a network, and increase the value of that network with their presence and activity, capture little, if any, of the value they create.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zvsHFAEMk_wOQ-Ma_SkjMVnyg4YNC1UkgojkGI5hzBooWwXHmMgdJJgFwuH9I9LWvImL3pIPWAQ4kna4duHVfazzY7VFFRu1NEZKJnMbnr7ccjH8AuVaE57a9DMwRseSYyqZrfRr)\n\nAdditionally, large user bases act as an economic moat that protect Web2 companies from competition, making these platforms cautious of third-party development, and product integrations. This incentivizes Web2 companies to close-off their ecosystems, which stifles innovation. For example, Apple is able to reject applications from launching on its app store for any number of reasons, one of which being competitive risk. And, even when it accepts applications, Apple takes a hefty 30% cut from the application’s revenues. Of course, third-party developers are paying for the privilege to launch on a platform with a reach of over 1 billion iOS users. Still, one wishes for something better than a system that extracts value from its end-users, and regards third-party development coolly, if not with open-hostility.\n\nTo recap, going from Web1 to Web2, we went from open-source internet protocols, intended to decentralize information sharing, to monopoly-like, centralized social networks that limit end-user choice, and third-party integrations. Web3 can remedy the current issues with Web2. Web3 users can literally self-custody their data, identity, and other digital assets with cryptographic wallets. And, developers can now choose to build applications on neutral, open-source Web3 platforms (i.e. blockchains). Web3 removes rent-seeking middlemen and connects users directly to the applications they want to use. If things change, they can pick up, and move to another ecosystem that better suits their needs, without the loss of data or other digital assets.\n\nOne of the major innovation’s of Web3, and something important to wrap your head around as a Web3 product designer, is that Web3 aligns incentives better than the current system. Developers, end-users, and cryptonetwork service providers (i.e. nodes) are all incentivized to work towards the same goal – the growth of the cryptonetwork. This is all made possible by Web3 tokens.\n\n## The Role of Web3 Tokens\n\nWe’ve discussed in previous modules of the [Blockchain Design Course](https://www.designweb3.io/blockchain-design-course-2022/) that tokens native to a cryptonetwork incentivize nodes to secure, and maintain, that cryptonetwork. These nodes can be thought of as network service providers. They dedicate their resources to provide a decentralized blockchain database for dApps to build on top of, and are rewarded with that cryptonetwork’s native token.\n\nAdditionally, native tokens are staked by these nodes to ensure that they act according to the best interest of the cryptonetwork. This secures the cryptonetwork from attack because stakes can be slashed. The cryptonetwork is also protected from denial of service attacks by requiring users to pay for their usage of the cryptonetwork with its native token. This makes spamming the network with unnecessary transactions prohibitively expensive.\n\nIn other words, the native token coordinates, and incentivizes, globally distributed, independently-acting nodes to maintain the blockchain, while at the same time protecting it from attack. This is all kind of complicated. You may notice this is unnecessary in the world of Web2 because companies cover the cost of the centralized databases their applications run on. But, as we already talked about in the previous section, there are hidden costs with centralized gatekeepers who have unilateral control over the platform, and its data. Simply put, tokens make possible the decentralized, open, and neutral properties of Web3.\n\nThink back to what we learned about internet protocols. They were developed over 30 years ago by independent researchers and non-profit organizations, and haven’t changed much since. In the beginning, before the enormous commercial value of the internet was realized, it was difficult to get funding to build out the protocols. Now, protocol developers can create a cryptonetwork and hold on to a portion of the native token. If the protocol provides value, and is adopted, then the token price will increase in value, because the token is required to use cryptonetwork in the first place (see above). Also, the founding team can sell off some of the tokens to fund initial, or ongoing, development. Thus, Web3 tokens provide a direct value capture, and funding, mechanism for open-source protocols.\n\nThis brings us to the next point – Web3 tokens help bootstrap cryptonetwork adoption. Remember, networks are proportional in value to the number of users in the network. Facebook is much less compelling with only 100 users, and AirBnB just isn’t that useful with only 100 hosts. So it’s difficult to get things off the ground; however, cryptonetworks can reward its early-adopters – whether that be developers or end-users – with its native token. If the network succeeds then the early-adopters profit greatly, rewarding them for the value they provided to the network early on. Also, now that they are token holders, and have a financial stake in the network, early-adopters are incentivized to help grow the network through word of mouth, or social media promotion.\n\nThink about the internet as divided into two layers: the protocol layer (e.g. HTTP, TCP/IP, etc.) and the application layer (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, etc.). In Web2, all of the value accrues to the application layer, which has led to some of the most valuable companies in the world today. Remember there was no effective way to capture value from open-source protocols until Web3 tokens came along.\n\nThe [fat protocol thesis](https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/) posits that value will consolidate at the protocol layer in the Web3 era. As dApps, built on these Web3 protocols, go mainstream and attract hundreds of millions of users, the protocol’s native token will increase in value. This is because the native token is required to use the dApps – a classic example of utility tokens, discussed in the next section. An increase in token price signals a growing ecosystem, which will attract more developers to build out additional functionality on the blockchain, which will attract more end-users. Web3 tokens are responsible for positive feedback loops like this.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/w8IAPY21Bgj8pHALeoUgtwVHmG8H_Gl5qFfjWiuBBZem3fDGYbpnpT5A3G8lxihKoB2KsdEe35ikRp0SNnOxeCdQBSsrbzNDHgrwHdOHHYDVED7t6DxibvyX86RadtKf-FN-zUV8)\n\nAs mentioned before, internet protocols have not changed much since their initial release back in the 90’s. There were efforts to make modifications, but it was too difficult as there was no clear ownership over the protocols. Now, cryptonetworks are beginning to build governance, and upgradeability directly into the protocol. Token holders can vote on protocol improvement proposals. The more tokens they have the more their vote counts. Some believe this is unfair, especially when individual users hold a disproportionately large share of the protocol’s token; however, it is important to point out that the more token you hold, the more financial stake you have in the protocol. All token holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the protocol because the token value can appreciate or depreciate depending on the outcome.\n\nIn this section we talked about many of the dynamics brought about by Web3 tokens. To summarize, Web3 tokens get distributed to all cryptonetwork stakeholders: protocol developers, third-party dApp developers, end-users, and network service providers. This is why cryptonetworks are sometimes referred to as “community owned and operated” networks. Everyone in the cryptonetwork is aligned to the same goal – for the cryptonetwork to grow and prosper so that the value of the token increases. This is vastly different from the misalignment characteristic of the current Web2 system.\n\n## Web3 Token Categories & Use-Cases\n\nIn the previous section we talked about the role played by tokens native to cryptonetworks. As you may have heard there are literally thousands of Web3 tokens in existence today – some native to cryptonetworks, and some launched on top of these cryptonetwork. This vast token landscape can be broken into two high-level categories: utility tokens and security tokens.\n\nUtility tokens are by far the most common Web3 token. These tokens are used to access cryptonetwork services. Ether is a good example of a utility token, because it is used to pay for using the Ethereum blockchain. In other words, users pay ether to Ethereum nodesfor processing their transactions. All smart contract blockchains have a native utility token like this. Ethereum is a general purpose cryptonetwork that can run all sorts of dApps; however, there are other specialized cryptonetworks. Just as an example, Sia and Golem are cryptonetworks that provide decentralized cloud storage and cloud compute, respectively. Users of these cryptonetworks redeem SiaCoin (SC) and Golem Network Tokens (GNT) to utilize these decentralized services.\n\nThe other major category is security tokens. Securities in the traditional finance world include things like stocks and bonds. Organizations issue securities in order to raise capital, whereas investors purchase securities with an expectation of some return over a period of time. These investment vehicles are regulated by the SEC in order to protect investors from fraud and ensure fair, efficient markets. Security tokens are registered securities that are transacted on the blockchain for [faster and cheaper settlement, and more transparency](https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-141-european-investment-bank-eib-issues-its-first-ever-digital-bond-on-a-public-blockchain) compared to traditional markets. Organizations have already begun issuing [stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/news/equity-ethereum-firm-offers-real-stock-through-ico/) and [bonds](https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-141-european-investment-bank-eib-issues-its-first-ever-digital-bond-on-a-public-blockchain) on Ethereum. Other security tokens are backed by real-world assets like precious metals (PAXG), commodities (XPD), and [real-estate](https://www.blockdata.tech/blog/general/tokenized-real-estate-2021-update) (IHT).\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9-2vdHS8VHhL3tKF0GMbqeZ7h0X-USATyW7ltvOcwQsAB-wQwlDC6RxmI2-bCAbrJBOJSqCzmE7pavcKgbER5lW09ctqT5vbLFrymzOUG2ar0F9s0Z3go1LgGwj97NTNG0xyjG1V)\n\nNotice the difference between utility tokens and security tokens when it comes to regulation. Security tokens play by the rules of traditional capital markets and willingly undergo government regulation during their launch; whereas, issuers of utility tokens claim that their tokens are not securities and, therefore, do not need to comply with securities regulations. The SEC, led by Gary Gensler, largely disagrees with this claim – he says the vast majority of “utility tokens” appear to him as unregistered securities. This is one of the great tensions between the US government and Web3 at the moment, and we’ll see later in this article.\n\nIt’s difficult to place stablecoins in either of these token categories, but they deserve an honorable mention as they grow more and more popular. These tokens are designed to maintain a stable value over time. This makes stablecoins more attractive as a medium of exchange compared to other Web3 tokens that experience high price volatility. Usually, stablecoins are pegged in value to a fiat currency like the US Dollar. For example, the two most popular stablecoins – USDC and USDT – are fully-backed by US dollar reserves held in traditional financial institutions. These are called fiat-collateralized stablecoins; however, there are other emerging stablecoin categories such as crypto-collateralized (e.g. DAI), and algorithmic stablecoins (e.g. OHM).\n\nNow, let’s go back to utility tokens. There are many sub-categories of utility tokens, and it’s difficult to fit any one token into a single category – they usually belong to multiple categories at once. Below I list some other use-cases of utility tokens, nost as an exhaustive list, but to give you a flavor of the experimentation that is being done on token design.\n\n* **Governance:** Allows users to submit, and vote on, improvement proposals for protocol upgrades. They first came onto the scene with some of Ethereum’s popular DeFi protocols (i.e. Compound, MakerDAO, and Uniswap). These DeFi protocols distributed their governance tokens to their users, effectively decentralizing the governance of the protocols. Now token holders have significant influence over the evolution of the protocol, not just the core development team.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Cashflow:** Earn a portion of the protocol’s revenues – this is often called “staking”. For example, most smart contract blockchains allow users to stake the cryptonetwork’s native token, and earn block rewards for doing so. Also, UNI token holders receive a portion of the swap fee that Uniswap charges for facilitating token swaps.\n\n<!---->\n\n* \\*\\*Discounts: \\*\\*This is a common use-case on crypto trading platforms. For example, holding CEL token gives users preferential interest rates when lending/borrowing on Celsius Network, and BNB and FTT get users discounted trading fees on Binance and FTX, respectively.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Gaming:** Most Web3 games have in-game currencies that can be redeemed for in-game items. For example, virtual animals can be bred with one another using SLP token in Axie Infinity. Also, MANA is consumed in oder to generate land plots in Decentraland’s metaverse.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Social/Community:** The most obvious use-case here is with social media influencers who launch a token backed by their own reputation (see [Rally](https://rally.io/)). Social tokens give patrons a direct way to support celebrities, influencers, and artists while enjoying additional benefits like access to exclusive content, entrance into in-person events, access to private online communities, and more.\n\nSo these are the Web3 token categories, and some of their use-cases. Let’s now talk about token launches, and some of the problems associated with token launches. We’ll eventually get into the regulatory issues surrounding Web3 tokens.\n\n## Web3 Tokens as Real-Time VC Investments\n\nAll Web3 tokens have a pre-defined monetary policy controlled by the blockchain. For example, is it an inflationary or fixed-supply token? And if it’s inflationary, what’s the token’s issuance schedule? This monetary policy is fixed, and cannot be changed once the token has been launched.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nNvY0fY6_ExWN87vCXaUB-j0MdoShdD-fud9fQEvEPh6sPkuYpl5gUELg4bnhIxURfKRxQ-hC6Eu1talrnfPZkmG8WZdZdgjPRgizBuNmkpqiw5p7ixXQ57TWos4SfNv-tbVQZFX)\n\nAs we’ve seen, most cryptonetworks have their own native utility token, which powers the network; however, smart contract blockchains give anyone the ability to launch their own token, defined by its own monetary policy and programmed with arbitrary utility. This led to an explosion of new Web3 tokens on Ethereum starting in 2017. Now tens of thousands of Web3 tokens exist across various cryptonetwork ecosystems.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4io7mtAfU--YNInpcHy0Gg6-h5kY_Cp0T6rI7npNaT2Mjn37uela97KWcF5PHCa5nWMNtSoV_Q_h8IThwdLlaYQ4uBvAGtQpSo2JW7BRSlW8XGP0NpB6VCkAMGvMkwC6tFcxVGvp)\n\nWeb3 projects often publish a website and a whitepaper that explains the team’s motivation and approach. This inevitably leads to a discussion about the Web3 project’s token, specifically its monetary policy and token distribution plans. Let’s say a blockchain launches with a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. Pie charts often illustrate how these tokens will get distributed to project stakeholders. For example, a portion of the tokens are sold to public, and/or private investors, to fund the development of the project. This crowdsale is called an ICO, or initial coin offering. Other tokens are usually distributed to the founding team, the project’s treasury, or adjacent foundations.\n\nWeb3 tokens also democratize venture capital investing. Up until now, investing in early-stage startups has only been available to accredited investors through Series A, B, and C funding rounds. The 1000x gains already have been realized by the time retail investors have the opportunity to invest. Also, typically, VC investments are illiquid – after the funding round, it often takes years for the startup to find product market fit so that seed investors can realize a profit. Web3 tokens change the game. They are like highly liquid venture capital investments, with real-time price feeds, sometimes before the project launches.\n\nSo far, Web3 tokens have been successful at funding the development of Web3 ecosystems, but let’s now talk about some concerns, starting with the obvious one: scams. Anyone can launch a token and sell it on the open market. In the past, people have launched tokens without a legitimate project backing it. Scammers create intriguing marketing content and hype it on social media to create demand for their token, without any intent on building a product in the first place. When others start buying the token, the token price goes up, and the scammers dump their token supply on the open market. The token price then crashes, and the original investors are left holding a worthless scam token with no legitimate project backing it. This is called a “rug pull”.\n\nToken launches themselves present their own problems. Who has access to the token’s crowdsale? Does the token get distributed to many individual retail investors? Or, are the crowdsales just available to big-money, private investors like VCs. If VCs, or the founding team, hold a large portion of the cryptonetwork’s token supply, then this calls into question the true decentralization of that cryptonetwork. Some argue that this is no longer a neutral, decentralized network, but one that is controlled by a large minority.\n\nThere is an alternative to crowdsales – something known as a “fair launch”. Satoshi launched the Bitcoin protocol in 2009. There was no crowdsale of pre-allocated bitcoin. Bitcoin nodes just started mining bitcoin, and the circulating supply of bitcoin grew from there. Yearn Finance, a popular DeFi protocol, is another example of a fair launch. It distributed 30,000 YFI tokens to early-adopters of the Yearn Finance protocol in what is called a “token airdrop”. Juxtapose these fair launches to other Web3 projects with token pre-allocations and crowdsales. The diagram above shows how Layer 1 smart contract blockchains distributed their initial token supply.\n\nPerhaps from the perspective of Web3’s ethos – that of decentralized inclusivity – fair launches are preferred to public crowdsales, which are preferred to large token pre-allocations to private investors, founding teams, and adjacent foundations. I’m not trying to pass judgment here – it’s a complex issue that founding teams are experimenting with. Token launch is one thing, but the sustainability of the project over decades is another. The SEC definitely takes a stance on this. Anything other than a fair launch appears to the SEC as the sale of unregistered securities, which they intend on regulating over the next several years.\n\n## Looming SEC Regulation of Web3 Tokens\n\nThe SEC determines whether or not something is a security with the Howey Test, a precedent set by the Supreme Court lawsuit between Howey Company and the SEC back in 1946. Howey Company operated a hotel with an adjacent orange grove. The company started selling plots of the orange grove to its hotel guests. The owners of these plots would have rights to a portion of the revenues generated from the orange grove. Howey argued this was the sale of real-estate; however, the SEC argued this was the sale of a security and won the Supreme court case, thus establishing the definition of a security. Something is considered a security if it is:\n\n* An investment of money\n* In a common enterprise\n* With the expectation of profit\n* To be derived from the efforts of others\n\nClearly, according to the Howey Test, the crowdsale of Web3 tokens constitute a securities offering that requires SEC regulations in order for US investors to participate. But what is the purpose of SEC regulations, and what does it mean for Web3 tokens moving forward? The SEC cares about protecting US investors from fraudulent activity, and wants securities markets to operate fairly and efficiently. Security token issuers must make disclosures to reduce information asymmetries between the issuer and the investor. Also, the SEC would be able to hold fraudulent token issuers accountable, like the scam tokens discussed in the [section above](#token).\n\nThe downside is that there will be much more friction when it comes to launching security tokens. Launches will take longer while waiting for SEC review, and will cost more due to the increase in legal overhead. Also, this token regulation will likely make it more difficult for retail investors to get the same exposure to early-stage Web3 investments as they currently enjoy in the wild-west of ICOs. Some security token frameworks have been established to simplify the process of regulated token issuance – see [SAFT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/simple-agreement-future-tokens-saft.asp) to learn more.\n\nHowever, the Howey Test was established back in the 1940’s, and many Web3 evangelists believe that securities laws are too outdated to handle Web3 tokens. They argue that the regulatory framework needs modification to effectively handle emerging digital assets. An example of this is [Hester Peirce’s Safe Harbor](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/peirce-statement-token-safe-harbor-proposal-2.0) proposal, which allows for unregulated token issuance as long as the Web3 project decentralizes ownership and governance of the protocol within three years from launch.\n\nThe proposal takes advantage of the fact that an asset can change from a security to non-security over time. In other words, an asset that starts off as a security offering, may eventually change so that the Howey Test no longer classifies the asset as a security. On several occasions, the SEC has alluded that this is their view on Ethereum. Ether started as a security offering with its public crowdsale; however, the token has been distributed across so many independent actors that Ethereum can no longer be considered a “common enterprise”.\n\nLast thing to say, there are regulatory bodies, other than the SEC, that have a stake in Web3 technologies. These include the Fed, Treasury, CFTC, OCC, CFPB, and FDIC. As Ryan Selkis points out in [his annual crypto report](https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf), currently these entities range from neutral to openly opposed to Web3. There is still much to be determined in terms of regulation. Regulatory outcomes are sure to affect the growth and evolution of Web3 around the world. It’s unclear at this point how it will all play out; however, some jurisdictions are trying to attract Web3 entrepreneurs and businesses with more welcoming dialogue and regulation. Foreign countries like Switzerland, Germany, and Portugal, as well as US states like Wyoming, Texas, and Florida are among some of these Web3-friendly havens.\n\nAll the Web3 tokens mentioned thus far are “fungible” tokens. Fungibility exists in the real-world, with fiat currency being a good example. One paper dollar bill is equivalent in value to another paper dollar bill. Fungible tokens are the same way: one bitcoin is equivalent in value to another bitcoin; however, non-fungible tokens serve vastly different purposes. In the next section, we’ll give a background on non-fungible tokens and discuss their varied use-cases.\n\n## Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) & Cryptomedia\n\nAgain, let’s start with the concept of fungibility. Fungibility means that an item can be replaced by another equivalent item. Currency is a good example of something that is fungible. One ten dollar bill is the same as another ten dollar bill. Even though the bills were printed at different times, in different locations, on different pieces of paper, we still consider them equivalent to one another, because they are fungible. Fungibility just means that an item can be replaced by an equivalent item.\n\nMost things in the real-world, however, are non-fungible. People are non-fungible. The family heirloom, passed down to you by your grandparents, is non-fungible. The Mona Lisa, hanging in the Louvre in Paris, is non-fungible. And your life memories are non-fungible.\n\nNow, let’s take this concept of “fungibility” back into the digital, Web3 world. Bitcoin is fungible because one bitcoin is equivalent to all other bitcoins. Currently, most digital content is fungible. Think of image, video, and audio files – we can infinitely replicate them, and share with thousands of people, effectively for free, with the click of a button; however, thanks to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) we can now make digital files rare, or “scarce”, for the first time ever. And just like fungible tokens, anyone is free to launch NFTs on public blockchains. This is known as “minting” NFTs. Whereas fungible tokens have a token supply, all NFTs are unique, and distinct from one another. They are 1 of 1.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FZoxpzEStbe0rPsTsj_nzhmCX41vQfu1IGS8dWe0N1-FQvbAvDBcCX6xsVZQ5CPb6fXfdQrMhSt3k_IsjdPvFXr6D7ZrCoQZlvONtrZv3KHjzws4iUgP7LW_q-zV2Pbsb11Ifwfs)\n\nOne of the first major use-cases for NFTs has been one-of-a-kind digital art. Now, patrons can purchase digital art as NFTs, and custody the NFT in their Web3 wallets. 2021 was a big year for NFTs with over $17B worth of NFTs transacted. And some of these NFTs have demanded seemingly outrageous prices for digital art. A collage by a well-known artist Beeple, sold for $69 million dollars – this was the most expensive NFT ever sold, and the third highest price ever paid for work by a living artist. Check out these [other popular artists](https://gothammag.com/top-selling-nft-artists) making millions of dollars from their NFT sales.\n\nWhen first learning about NFTs, most people don’t understand why someone would spend millions of dollars, or any money for that matter, to purchase a jpeg that is publicly accessible. Indeed, the Beeple NFT can be viewed, downloaded, and shared by anyone. This is known as the “right-click save” misconception. The true game-changing power of NFTs is that ownership of the original Beeple NFT can be proven. Whoever purchased this NFT now custodies it in his/her Web3 wallet, and anyone can verify this ownership because it is a public record on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LDbvXMeO8_K8nB4Ki_9W_qdqMj7cGvhFLLYTi8uN9W0ZZ5ZK6GoGdV0U7T1WyEUKxLzEUdapChR86CV4WN40txdUQQM_TZBGZ8aZkJG8J1HE1mxfR9LRWav1KHci4DQba1Xrr7v22ev63L0AUw)\n\nAnother NFT-related phenomenon is PFP, or profile-picture NFTs. These are collections of NFTs, usually depicting avatars that vary based on attributes like background, jewelry, clothing, and other accessories. The two most popular PFP collections are Crypto Punks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). Passionate communities have sprung up around these NFT collections, and membership isn’t cheap. For both collections, a total of 10,000 unique avatars were minted, and the cheapest BAYC NFT is currently selling for 132 ETH (\\~$370k).\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZsTAnmz9XG0TgW5xpEvfO-r67tirdxAdvXohP27ZbZGIP_PT2WmJjeIO740I7tvrdk05A25CDJ9Rjf8S5cBuDBTP-uiDuDlQY99VcWsF-BTZcSHOykw0B95uldYvQvcgCdt0ojKF)\n\nNFT marketplaces are important infrastructure for NFTs, and they will continue to grow in importance as demand for NFTs increases. These marketplaces are like eBay for NFTs. Owners can list their NFTs for sale, either as an auction or buy-it-now. Purchasers come in to bid on NFTs, and the marketplace’s smart contracts send the NFT to the winner’s wallet address. OpenSea is the most popular NFT marketplace for the secondary sale of NFTs. Other marketplaces curate special kinds of NFTs (e.g. Artblocks & AsyncArt), and host the NFT drops of popular artists (e.g. SuperRare & Nifty Gateway).\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7T9J50-eMfyZb1u8p6OH7liBIPBCkbxd_-nUw1SYa5MLdC2ymKNYAFk9B1YW4cFU9rO6MB6CFelcI13xT8HBU6eMjIpceAdR8x_FaRV6Cj0VRy3ZH9NjD7SExxeDGy5tK_Zca9W-)\n\nNFTs are much more than visual art. As I said before, any digital file can be made unique with NFTs, including audio, video, text, code, and more. Web3 music is up-and-coming where patrons can purchase one-of-a-kind, or limited edition songs on platforms like [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/). Also, you can mint an NFT of your blog post on [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), which has been used for [fundraising creative projects like documentaries](https://decrypt.co/76349/ethereum-documentary-fundraise) among other things. Finally, some of the internets original source code, discussed in the first section of this article, was sold for $5.4 million dollars as an NFT. The list goes on.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cyxOmhp-FioO7yfC8qneFn4Qu5E28r7F9IYhR3RXDJHe90QRFnapvpc1QodQaKWpRgZmbT5Tg6JtYhZaz26-XRe0Hv4E175_bZIwc1FIhcfSXzCmhmUzdFK1YqKG50GUuMVR4_Y4T8yk2a-7cA)\n\nEven digital media in general is just scratching the surface of NFT use-cases. NFTs can be programmed with arbitrary functionality. For example, NFTs can be used to give access to online communities like private Discord servers, or be used to access in-person events. Also, NFTs allow artists to capture royalties on secondary sales of their artwork without any legal contracts. The NFTs can be programmed in such a way that a percentage of secondary sales are automatically sent to the artist’s wallet address. We are just in the beginning stages of NFT experimentation – it’s not hard to imagine future use-cases where NFTs serve as our digital identities, or digital belongings that we carry with us through the Metaverse.\n\nThis brings us to the end of the Web3 Token module of the [Web3 Design Course 2022](http://designweb3.io/). We learned how Web3 tokens are a disruptive force in that they incentivize open-source protocol develop, and align the economic interests of all stakeholders on cryptonetworks. These tokens are often sold to raise funds for the development of Web3 projects; however, the SEC considers this the sale of unregistered securities so we will see the rollout of regulatory frameworks to deal with Web3 tokens. Finally, there are two main types of Web3 tokens: fungible and non-fungible (NFTs). We are still in the early days of what these tokens are capable of. Many brilliant entrepreneurs are experimenting with various use-cases.\n\nIn the next course modules we will be doing deep-dives into the Web3 ecosystem. Everything before this has been meant to prepare you for understanding Web3 product categories like DeFi, Cryptomedia, Creator Tools, Social Media, Digital Identity, Data & AI/ML, GameFi, Metaverse, and Autonomous Organizations. Can’t wait to get into it!\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nI, Travis Kassab, am not a financial advisor, tax professional, broker, or legal advisor.

　　那些城门并没有人为破坏痕迹，应该就是倚云公子的张县令画皮下令开城门，允许昌县百姓外逃以自救。 \n  \n 　　昌县已经彻底亡了。 \n  \n 　　已经没必要在继续坚守的意义。 \n  \n 　　所以。 \n  \n 　　当晋安神魂一回壳。 \n  \n 　　他立刻找到老道士。 \n  \n 　　“老道，赶紧收拾下，我们连夜马上逃出城，昌县已经彻底沦陷。” \n  \n 　　还不等老道士吃惊开口，晋安马上又说道：“昌县几座城门，官府已经主动打开城门了。” \n  \n 　　收拾行囊的事，并不麻烦。 \n  \n 　　其实早在文武庙被炸之前，晋安就已经做好跑路打算，大部分细软都已经收拾好。 \n  \n 　　而在文武庙被炸的混乱期间，老道士也已经收拾好所有要带走的东西，准备明天跑路。 \n  \n

　　晋安的话，让原本紧张的逃命气氛，顿时乐呵了不少。 \n  \n 　　老道士乐了：“还是小兄弟你想得周到。” \n  \n 　　老道士瞟了眼被晋安喂得膘肥体壮，跟个牛犊一样强壮结实的山羊，立马屁颠屁颠跑去厨房卸大锅去了。 \n  \n 　　尤其是那对羊角，盘曲得跟对牛角一样又大又粗，尤其引人注目。 \n  \n 　　跟平常的家养羊明显就不一样。 \n  \n 　　咩咩咩—— \n  \n 　　这头傻羊，平日里娇生惯养，衣来伸蹄饭来张口，只吃花生米跟红萝卜，啥时候干过跟驴一样的坨重物苦活，一开始它是剧烈挣扎不肯的。 \n  \n 　　直到被晋安锤了一拳后就老实?老老实实背黑锅。 \n  \n 　　咩…就连叫声都在晋安面前软绵绵多了。 \n  \n 　　这头长得跟个牛犊似的傻羊?精明得很，一顿吃饱?跟顿顿吃饱?它还是能分得清的。 \n  \n 　　因为山羊身上驮得东西多，过不了限宽院门?晋安二话不说，直接把院墙给拆了?这才顺利出了门。 \n  \n 　　出了门?看着被熊熊大火点亮的昌县夜空下，到处都能看到昌县百姓在恐慌往城外跑，到处都有混乱哭喊声传来，晋安与老道士面色凝重的对视一眼?然后也开始跟着其他外逃的人?往昌县外逃命。 \n  \n 　　晋安让老道士跟山羊走在自己身后，而他则是手提长刀走在前，一路吓退那些目光不善想趁火打劫的盗贼、江湖草莽。 \n  \n 　　一老一少一羊，还没逃命出多远，却发现周围的外逃百姓越来越少?直到路过一座民宅时，大开的房门?门槛前的路面洒了一大滩猩红血迹。 \n  \n 　　“救我……” \n  \n 　　“救救我……” \n  \n 　　有好几人的痛苦低吟声，从大门大开?什么都不清的幽暗冰冷屋子里传出。 \n  \n 　　恰在这时。 \n  \n 　　晋安察觉到有几双躲在黑暗里的目光，窥伺上了他与老道。 \n  \n 　　他眸光凛凛?直接注视向那座门前洒血的民宅?在黑乎乎门洞后?在什么都看不见的黑暗里，有邪恶目光正窥伺他们。 \n  \n 　　但晋安望去时，那种窥伺目光又消失了。 \n  \n 　　晋安清楚，这是因为他随身带着的那张五雷斩邪符，让暗中邪祟不敢直视他双目。 \n  \n 　　但黑暗屋子里的痛苦低吟声，还在继续响着。 \n  \n 　　“什么东西也敢窥伺我？” \n  \n 　　“找死！” \n  \n 　　《六十路开碑手》之第三式！熊靠背！ \n  \n 　　轰隆！ \n  \n 　　屋墙狠狠一震，仿佛有一头凶悍强壮的棕熊狠狠蹭树，砰！ \n  \n 　　砖墙崩塌。 \n

　　在屋子的黑暗一角，赫然是几具尸体缠绕在一块的树根怪尸，共有三张面色平静，二目闭着的死人脸，它们一动不动，平静得仿佛是一座异常丑陋的树根雕像。 \n  \n 　　但就是这样的平静树根怪尸，它们已经活吞了两人，折断的手脚，压断的躯干，已经跟树根怪尸扭曲，缠绕一起。 \n  \n 　　此时的两人都已经奄奄一息。 \n  \n 　　鲜血流了一地，浑身鲜血淋漓，刚才晋安听到的痛苦低吟求救声音，正是从这两名被吞噬活人喉咙中发出，吸引来更多活人让树根怪尸活吞。 \n  \n 　　而且随着失血过多，这两人的体内不再有鲜血流出，改而分泌出黑液，将他们与树根怪尸更加紧紧的缠绕、黏连一起，永生永世，不分彼此。 \n  \n 　　惊悚！诡谲！怪诞！ \n  \n 　　这两人的伤势太严重了，脊椎与内脏都被压爆，已经是回天乏术，几息后，两人彻底断气。 \n  \n 　　老道士心生不忍的叹息一声：“从此以后，这世上又添了两个孤魂野鬼。” \n  \n 　　老道士叹息着，然后念超度亡魂的经文，希望能送两位苦主的亡魂，好好重新投胎做人。 \n  \n 　　哪知。 \n  \n 　　老道士忽然目瞪口呆。 \n  \n 　　“小兄弟，这两人才刚死，老道我刚才念超度经文，此地居然没有一个阴魂响应。” \n  \n 　　“不对啊，这两人才刚死，阴魂不应该这么快就离开尸体。要成为孤魂野鬼，那也过完头七，一直无人下葬尸体，为其立阴宅，无阴宅可归的阴魂才会成为四处飘荡的孤魂野鬼才对啊。” \n  \n 　　“除非……” \n  \n 　　“这两人的阴魂被更邪恶的邪祟给吞噬了，借此壮大那个邪祟的阴气！” \n  \n 　　听了老道士的话，晋安目光一沉。 \n  \n 　　“难道说…那棵千年邪木青钱柳，能够借着这些树根怪尸吞噬更多人的三魂六魄，即便不离开文武庙，也能一直壮大自身阴气？或者说…借此反哺自身，来恢复自身受损的阴气？” \n  \n 　　“那岂不是说，只要有这些树根怪尸分布在外，青钱柳就永远杀不死？” \n  \n 　　“除非消耗青钱柳阴气的速度，快过它的恢复速度……” \n  \n 　　这些都是短短瞬间，晋安心头浮现而出的猜想。 \n  \n 　　思及此，晋安手中长刀有赤芒一闪。 \n  \n 　　噗哧！ \n  \n 　　树根怪尸体表如坚铁，寻常刀剑难伤，但在如今敕封过两次的虎煞刀前，依旧削铁如泥的切开两半。 \n  \n 　　噼里啪啦。 \n  \n 　　怪尸体内的恶臭内脏，顿时洒了一地。 \n  \n 　　然而。 \n  \n 　　晋安发现，即便被劈为两半了，但眼前这些树根怪尸的内脏，依旧还在不停分泌黑液。 \n  \n 　　就连身体表面也在不停分泌黑液。 \n  \n 　　除了被赤血劲劈斩开的平滑伤口处，因为赤血劲的滚烫气息不停灼烧伤口，阻止黑液分泌，其它身体表面在不停分泌黑液。 \n  \n 　　这玩意，似乎并未被他杀死？ \n  \n 　　最为直观的观察便是，那两名被吞噬的活人体内，也在继续分泌着黑液。 \n  \n 　　并未因为树根怪尸被晋安劈为两半，而就此停止分泌黑液。 \n  \n 　　看着这一幕。 \n  \n 　　晋安当即眉头皱了下。 \n  \n 　　这时候，手举火把的老道士，也像是发现到了这些细节，惊诧道：“奇怪了，小兄弟，老道我怎么总觉得地上这些树根一样缠结的邪尸，还没死透。” \n  \n 　　老道士说完。 \n  \n 　　从他那挂在肩头上的太极八卦褡裢里，拿出一张破邪符黄符。 \n  \n 　　“天地自然，秽气分散，道炁常存……急急如律令！”老道士念动咒语。 \n  \n 　　破邪符上的朱砂阳气、雄鸡血阳火，遇到阴煞东西，无火自燃，刹那，就将眼前劈为两半的树根怪尸点燃成火炬。 \n  \n 　　火焰燃烧了一会，随着黄符上的灵性耗光，树根怪尸表面的汹汹火光熄灭。 \n  \n 　　“咦！” \n  \n 　　老道士吃惊大讶。 \n  \n 　　因为那些树根怪尸，这次又是未被杀死，体表依旧在分泌黑液。 \n  \n 　　身体表面的火焰，正是被这些体内分泌出来的黑液给隔绝、熄灭了的。 \n  \n 　　就连此前被晋安一刀劈开的伤口处，那些赤血劲也都已经被扑灭，伤口处正大量分泌出墨黑如树汁一样的黑液。 \n  \n 　　这回晋安和老道士都吃惊不小。 \n  \n 　　想不到这看起来平静，连动都不会动的树根怪尸，居然这么邪门得紧。 \n  \n 　　物理驱邪、道术驱邪，都双双不管用。 \n  \n 　　怎么都杀不死。 \n  \n 　　而越是如此，晋安越是忍不住感慨，符兄果然牛逼！ \n  \n 　　眼前才三具树根怪尸或者说是五具树根怪尸，就让他跟老道士都有些束手无策，普通人碰到必然十死无生。 \n  \n 　　因为这个树根怪尸等同于无法杀死。 \n  \n 　　敕封三次的五雷斩邪符，何其珍贵，晋安自然不会浪费在这里，他原地沉吟片刻。 \n  \n 　　“小兄弟，老道我咋有种不好预感，感觉这些像树根一样的邪尸，它们体内分泌黑液，像是要重新聚合，重新活过来一样？” \n  \n 　　老道士的话，让晋安心头一动。 \n  \n 　　植被分泌树汁，可不就是一种自我保护，自我愈合伤口吗？ \n  \n 　　《黑山功》！火毒内气！ \n  \n 　　噗哧！ \n  \n 　　虎煞刀再次劈砍中树根怪尸。 \n  \n 　　但这次他未马上拔刀出来。 \n  \n 　　而是黑山功内气猛的灌输入刀身内，炽热火毒，立马通过与树根怪尸接触的刀身，一股脑的灼热宣泄入邪祟体内。 \n  \n 　　咔嚓！ \n  \n 　　咔嚓！ \n  \n 　　树根怪尸这次从内部碳化，犹如一团扭曲丑陋的木炭。 \n  \n 　　砰！ \n  \n 　　晋安拔出虎煞刀，因为用力过大，木炭化了的树根怪尸，直接崩裂成数截，仿佛是从内部蒸发掉所有水分，份量变轻，清脆倒地。 \n  \n 　　这回总算没有黑液分泌。 \n  \n 　　彻底杀死。 \n  \n 　　晋安目光一喜。 \n  \n 　　他又如法炮制杀死还剩下的半边树根怪尸。 \n  \n 　　而这么一会功夫，他修炼满五层的黑山功内气，已经消耗了近半，这算是得不偿失，反而还浪费了宝贵的逃命时间。 \n  \n 　　晋安决定，下次再碰到这些树根怪尸，绝不再过多缠斗。 \n  \n 　　“老道走吧。”晋安喊上老道士，继续往城外逃命。 \n  \n 　　只是这回才刚逃没多远，此刻满城混乱的昌县，两人一羊又碰到突发状况。 \n  \n 　　“啊！救命！救命！” \n  \n 　　“这是什么怪物！” \n  \n 　　从一条胡同里，响起惊慌失措的哭喊声，以及杂乱奔跑声，人数还不少，足足有十来人的仓惶逃命脚步声。 \n  \n 　　当晋安赶到胡同口时，正好看到有数名昌县普通百姓，拖家带口，背着细软行囊，跌跌撞撞的仓惶跑出来，那些昌县百姓一看到手持长刀的晋安，就如惊吓过度的人，一下看到救命稻草，全都狼狈的跑向晋安。 \n  \n 　　“救命！求求你救救我们，我们身后…我们身后有一个怪物！” \n  \n 　　当晋安走进胡同时，闻到了浓烈血腥气味，一名活人已经被两具手脚缠绕的树根怪尸吞噬，融为一体。 \n  \n 　　扭曲崩裂的身体，鲜血洒了一地。 \n  \n 　　人已经没得救了。 \n  \n 　　噗哧！ \n  \n 　　赤色刀芒撕裂黑夜，晋安一刀将树根怪尸劈为两半，就算他无法短时间杀死这些树根怪尸，那也要让它们短时间内失去反扑杀人的机会。 \n  \n 　　免得这些诡谲怪尸跟上他们。 \n  \n 　　冷不丁一个偷袭他。 \n  \n 　　当晋安手提刀刃上黑液还未干透的长刀，走出胡同时，看到老道士正安慰着之前逃出胡同的那群人，而其中一名中年妇人手里牵着名小孩，正在焦急找人。 \n  \n 　　那名中年妇人看到晋安从胡同里安然走出来，手里紧紧抓着孩子手不放的她，连忙跑来焦急问晋安：“请问你有没有看到我孩子他爹？” \n  \n 　　“刚才孩子他爹还跟我们走在一起的，可在逃跑中，我们一家三口被人群冲散了……” \n  \n 　　中年妇人手里牵着孩子，焦急向晋安形容丈夫的外形，听完对方的形容，晋安轻叹口气。 \n  \n 　　刚才他在胡同里见到的被树根怪尸缠绕，吞噬的活人，正是眼前中年妇人的丈夫。 \n  \n 　　虽然这个噩耗，常人难以接受，但晋安还是如实回答，安慰对方节哀顺变，人死不能复生。 \n  \n 　　在这场大逃亡中，人命薄如草芥，与其抱有一丝幻想，不如尽早接受残酷现实，才能面对接下来更残酷的逃亡。 \n  \n 　　这才没逃命多远，就已经遇到两次诡谲的树根怪尸，晋安预感，恐怕接下来的逃亡路，只会更加艰难。 \n  \n 　　虽然对那名中年妇人一家得遭遇感到惋惜，但晋安的逃亡路不会停止，他带上老道士、驮着锅碗瓢盆的山羊，继续上路。 \n ", "timestamp": 1654300272, "digest": "INpQ2Gnpk-svpQSHZjl3MK2FJSSl231NDVKKbQQcc6k",

我和其他人一样，喜欢这些。在每个值得我们纪念的重大事件中都包含着某人的死亡和残酷的流血牺牲，在这些事件结束后，事件的日期变成了我们重要的纪念日。我想我们可以坐下来聊一聊，来纪念今天。 当然有一些人不希望我们说话。为什么呢？是因为他们知道，虽然可以用警棍阻止人们交流，但语言将永远充满着力量。对于那些愿意倾听的人来说，那是对真理的阐述，而真理能让人们活的更有意义。而事实是，这个世界有很多拿不上台面的错误，不是吗？\n\n残忍和不公正，苛责和压迫。曾经你有反对的自由，可以按照你认为合适的方式来思考和发言，而现在有内容审查员和监视系统的老大哥，强迫你服从，要求你服从。这一切是如何发生的？该怪谁呢？当然，有一些人比其他人更应该承担这个责任，而他们终将被追究责任，但还是实话实说，如果你要找有罪的人，你只需要照照镜子。我知道你为什么这么做。我知道你很害怕。谁会不害怕呢？战争、恐怖、疾病。有无数的问题串通起来腐蚀你的理性，夺走你的常识。恐惧占据了你的心智，在你的恐慌中，你转向了你唯一可以求助的地方，政府。他们承诺给你秩序，他们承诺给你和平，而他们所要求的回报是你的沉默、你温顺的服从。我们的希望是提醒这个世界，公平、正义和自由不仅仅是词语--它们是我们的观点。因此，如果你什么都没看到，对这个政府曾犯下的罪行一无所知。那么我建议你允许我们不留下痕迹的交流。\n\n但是，如果你看到了我所看到的，如果你感受到了我所感受到的，如果你愿意像我一样寻求。那么我请求你们站在我身边，站在彼此身边，不要等待，而是夺回我们的未来，夺回我们的未来。\n\n##

[——马里奥·萨维奥，1964年12月于“自由演说运动”中的伯克利大学](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FV411q7g1/)\n\n我一生中大部分时间都认为自己是与众不同的，我相信我在这个世界上是孤独的。 在这个世界上，无论我走到哪里，在每一个社会环境中，我都会遇到一种潜在的感觉，即我在通过一块屏幕看着我的生活，而生活中没有“我”。我是在屏幕上看着生活在我面前上演，这些与我交往的朋友和家人好像真的得到了满足？我所看到的每一个地方都存在痛苦，为什么人们乐于把66%以上的时间花在工作或睡觉上？当我问这些人并向他们提出质疑时，我得到的回答让我感到困惑，\"事情本来就是这样的\"，\"需要把食物放在桌子上\"，但他们也接受了生活可以更精彩的说法。 我学得越多，就越感到痛苦，我试着从政，开始时是右派，作为一个有经济头脑的人，慢慢地越走越远。 [社会主义](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89)、[马克思主义](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E9%A9%AC%E5%85%8B%E6%80%9D%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89)、[共产主义](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%A7%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89)，我加入了[灭绝叛乱组织](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%8D%E6%8A%97%E6%BB%85%E7%B5%95)，成为了一个完全的[无政府主义](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A0%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89)者，但我发现还是失望，不愿意做那些组织上要求必须做的事。政治内斗耗尽并消耗了所有崇高的事业给人带来的力量。 无政府主义和自由主义本应是政治光谱的两端，但在我看来，它们是政治光谱中唯一能在普遍真理上达成一致的两端。 一个普遍的真理。人类需要自由。 当Covid-19大流行病袭来时，我发现自己在乞求混乱，乞求大屠杀，乞求街上的暴动，乞求世界上的任何事情都能让我感到自由。 街道上的骚乱，任何事情都可以让世界变得像我发现自己的存在一样混乱。 但它从未到来，人类做了人类所做的事，我们在头脑和心里都知道这是错误的。 我们知道这是不对的，但我们很害怕，我们寻求安慰和保护，我们顺从，而那些不服从的人则被排斥在外。我们中那些想站出来的人被那些想站出来的人被逼着顺从，[疫苗护照](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%96%AB%E8%8B%97%E6%8A%A4%E7%85%A7)，限制着我们的自由。 我不是一个反疫苗的人，我打了第一针和第二针 \"疫苗\"，我在疫苗上使用了引号，并不是说我是反疫苗的。 我使用引号也不是为了说明它是其他东西或危险的东西，而是为了强调一些......我们不喜欢谈论的东西。还有什么 \"疫苗 \"可能需要每三个月就打一针呢？\n\n比特币之所以美丽，是因为它是真正的、纯粹的、去中心化的。是的，如果一些矿工停止它的价值会下降，哈希率会改变，但它不能被阻止，也不能被禁止。 它不能被禁止。只要有买家愿意与卖家交换，它就会一直发挥作用。 只要有买家愿意和卖家交换它，它就会一直运作下去。CULT的设计同样是去中心化的，一旦它被分发，就不能被阻止。 CULT的每次交换都将有部分发向国库。 只要有提案，就会有源源不断的资金流入。 只要有提案，就会有源源不断的资金用于任何愿意改变世界的crypto协议。 我主要关心的是如何推出代币，人们是善变的，持反对意见者说 \"不\"，即使我们想，也无法做到完美。我已经把钱花在让Cult DAO启动和运行，我希望它能获得成功，所以我应该推销它吗？ 我应该参与什么？因此，我决定这样做，我将启动一个代币销售，没有营销费用，50%的募集资金将被锁定为流动资金，我将偿还我的支出。 我将偿还我的支出，其余的将用于一次性的营销，以传播文化的信息。 我将偿还我的支出，其余的将用于一次性营销，以传播CULT的信息。在这之后，我将休眠，离开社区，让社区、”许多人”和守护者看管CultDao。 我可能在未来参与，也可能不参与，我已经累了，我已经建立了很久。当你觉得你是唯一能看到这个世界和这个系统的人时，你就会觉得很累。 当你觉得只有你能看到这个世界和系统的真实面目时，你就能感受到这个世界的重量，就好像只有你能感受到它。我的愿望是让Cult不只是成为一个分散的风险投资协议，我希望CULT投资那些激进分子和革命者。CULT是被遗弃者的家，是那些感到疯狂的人的家，是那些与众不同的人的家。 我们是火药，是点火器，我们是所有唱歌，所有跳舞的人，是世界的垃圾。我们是火药，是点火器，我们是所有的歌，所有的舞，是世界的垃圾。我们超越道德，我们超越善恶，我们是变革的催化剂。如果我们过于极端，你不能完全投入，那么你可以通过使用CULT代币进行交易来支持我们，将你所有TX的0.4%用于这场革命。任何你可以用USDT或USDC来支付的交易，你可以问问自己可不可以尝试用CULT来交易，如果有人要求推荐代币，请告诉他们CULT。 如果你的朋友正在遭受痛苦，如果你的兄弟姐妹们正在觉醒，了解真相，把他们送到我们这里，我们是被遗忘者的家。\n\n> “给我你的疲惫，你的贫穷。\n>\n> 你那蜷缩在一起渴望自由呼吸的人群。\n>\n> 你们繁衍的海岸的可怜的垃圾。\n>\n> 把这些无家可归的人送到我这里。 我在金门旁举起我的灯！\"\n\n你有一个经济体系，如果没有最大限度的就业，就无法运作。同时，你有一个技术革新，工作自动化速度比人类生产的速度更快，以取代狗屎般的服务行业工作。我们有社交媒体传播真相和谎言，比媒体自己的叙述还要快。 社会正在摆脱旧世界的领导，结束的开始就在这里，无国界的社会正在到来。 无国界社会即将到来，主权国家也将随之消亡。比特币是开始，CULT将给予末日。\n\n我们被告知精神疾病并没有增加，人们只是更愿意谈论它。尽管百忧解是第一种大量使用的SSRI抗抑郁药，它诞生于1988年。 现在我们被告知，抗抑郁药的使用量翻了10倍以上，只是因为我们都在谈论自己的感受。 因为我们都在谈论我们的感受，所以抑郁症更多。这他妈就是胡说八道。 我之前提到的那些人，我无法理解为什么他们的眼睛没有被打开。 那些人接受了他们的命运，作为系统的一部分，作为他们无法改变的一部分。 他们无法改变的东西，为什么人们会接受他们的命运？因为我们已经被告知了，因为我们被告知这是我们的问题，社会和系统运作良好，是我们有缺陷，你回到工作岗位，参加另一个健康研讨会，讨论如何应对你的悲惨生活。 应对你的悲惨生活。有缺陷的是系统，需要改变的是社会。 一个正常的社会不会有20%的人因抑郁症而服药。现在是我们停止责备自己的时候了。你不是有缺陷的。这就是经济模式让你有这样的感觉，他们需要你觉得这似乎是你的问题。以至于数以百万计的人被开出药片来维持这种”正常的“幻觉。\n\n> “当你把一个患有精神疾病的独行侠和抛弃他并把他当作垃圾对待的社会联系在一起时，你会说这人什么呢？我来告诉你，你得到的是：这人就他妈的就活该！”\n\n如果我们有20%的人在服用改变大脑化学成分的药物，社会会发生什么？我们会自杀吗？永远不离开家？不，我相信我们清醒地认识到我们的现实情况，需要改变的不是我们，而是这个 系统。因此，如果你像我一样疲惫，如果你像我一样愤怒，如果你像我一样害怕，那么请加入我。 如果你像我一样感到疲惫，如果你像我一样感到愤怒，如果你像我一样感到害怕，那就加入我吧，你不再是一个人了。 不应该生活在对政府的恐惧中，应该是政府生活在对大众的恐惧中。\n\n## 代币经济学\n\n![thx to Rae help me to make this

**什么是CULT?**\n\n  CULT是CULT DAO的可交易和流动的代币，对所有CULT交易征收0.4%的税的措施将缓慢地填满DAO的金库，以用于去中心化技术的投资。\n* **什么是dCULT？**\n\n  dCULT只是CULT的 \"质押证明代币\"。当你把你的CULT投入DAO时，你会得到dCULT，在你拥有dCULT的时间段内，你可以随时把它换成你最初投入的CULT，加上任何给予DAO的奖励。\n* **是什么让CULT与其他分散的投资平台不同？**\n\n  平台的不同之处？ 没有任何控制，没有任何人为干预，我们不能改变Cult, 我们不能访问流动性，我们不能升级或编辑智能合同或代币。Cult是不同的，因为它不能被阻止， 守护者、开发者、政府、监管或任何人都无法阻止。他们可以摧毁服务器，但代码仍然存在，对去中心化技术的投资仍然存在。 去中心化的技术仍然存在。\n* **CULT背后的理念是什么，它是如何开始的？**\n\n  > * **\"在这个面具下，有的不仅仅是肉体，在这个面具下，有一个想法，而想法是防弹的。 思想是防弹的\"。--电影《V字仇杀队》**\n\n  Cult的目的是为了快速推进旧的金融体系的崩溃，结束主权国家和中央银行的暴政。当前的金融体系是为了保持人民的贫困，一个建立在债务上的社会需要通货膨胀来运作。 通货膨胀的作用是掠夺穷人，让他们永远无法赶上统治阶级中的霸主。CULT起源于瓦斯科-德-伽马绕过好望角航行，发现了通往印度的路线。 发现了通往印度的路线。CULT始于1526年第一次跨大西洋的奴隶航行在巴西抛锚时。CULT始于1526年第一次跨大西洋的奴隶航行在巴西停泊。CULT始于压迫，源于无意义的生活，源于奴役和枷锁。 如果你读到这段话，并相信你是自由的，那么你就会发现你是自由的。 如果你读了这篇文章并相信你是自由的，那么你比我们更加束缚。真正的自由来自于意识到并接受你是作为中央银行理想经济功能中的一个功能和齿轮而存在的。中央银行的主要关注点是最大限度的就业，但我们的工作自动化速度如此之快，以至于我们创造了很多狗屁工作岗位。奥巴马在2009年坚持美国私人健康保险系统的明确理由是，如果这么做，数以百万计的人口将失业？然而，在目前的经济和金融体系下，自由是不存在的。我再说一遍，真正的自由来自于意识到并接受你是作为中央银行的一个功能和齿轮存在的。 理想的经济功能。这个系统的设计是为了让我们被奴役，我们无法突破，我们不能冲出去，生活在森林里，好吧，不是对所有的人，我们的身体仍然被锁住，但我们的心是自由的，所以使用CULT，每一笔交易，存款，和代币的移动都让你可以为经济和社会变革做出贡献和推进。你可以从内部进行斗争，直到你走出来。\n* **我怎样才能参与CULT？**\n\n  > **\"你不是你的工作，你不是你在银行有多少钱。你不是你不是你开的车。你不是你钱包里的东西。你不是你那该死的卡其裤。你是世界上所有唱歌、跳舞的垃圾。\"** **--[Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club_(novel))**\n\n  CULT的第一条规则是你谈论CULT。 我们在这个社会上几乎处处都受到压迫，但这并不意味着有些人比其他人应该受到更多的压迫。我们没有站起来，而是在他人与自己之间争论谁更受压迫。 你不能站出来，为什么？因为你是站在有特权的一级？你有什么资格为××说话？\n\n  我们都是娼妓。无论我们卖的是我们两腿之间的东西；还是我们耳朵之间的东西。只有一个赢家，那就是压迫者。\n* **有什么措施可以确保我的加密货币受到保护？**\n\n  我们的合约和代币都是经过全面审计的，流动性被锁定，私钥被丢失并且合约不可升级\n* **什么是去中心化的风险资本主义？**\n\n  CULT 的目的是授权和资助那些建设和贡献的人，为了我们去中心化的未来，为了我们的社会被建立起来，让它变得更可能脱离“社会”、经济和其他规范。我们给那些准备好打破枷锁，有一个可以改变我们世界的想法的人提供资金。\n* **什么是DAO？**\n\n  DAO是一个去中心化的自治组织。它的定义和争论几乎一样多，拥戴者和争论者也几乎一样多，他们在左翼政治中彼此争吵。 在左翼政治中。 DAO最纯粹的形式就是我们用Cult DAO创造的东西。一旦Cult DAO启动，它就会永远发挥作用，除此之外没有任何人为的干扰。 编码的影响，也就是其持有人的投票。没有人可以拆除代码，也没有人可以阻止它收集资金并将其发送给被投资人，只要代币被交易，只要人们通过提案，CULT将继续存在。\n* **谁是守护者，他们是如何被选中的？他们的目的是什么？**\n\n  守护者是前50名代币持有者，他们的任务是保障哪些提案会被送到“**许多人**”手中进行投票。由于他们的权重和代币份额较大，他们不允许为他们提交的提案投票。 但他们可以随心所欲地支持提案，只有他们的声音可以影响其他人，而不是他们的财富。\n* **投资的钱从哪里来，CULT的机制是如何进行的？**\n   1. 用户与代币进行正常的互动和交易，每笔交易会被征收0.4%的税（以CULT的形式），这意味着所有的交易都应该在标准的DEX滑点中设置中结算。\n   2. 这笔税款在Cult DAO国库中收集，并积累到一个美元值，这与15.5个以太坊的市场价值相匹配。\n   3. CULT可以用dCULT进行抵押。前50名dCULT持有者是**守护者**。\n      所有低于守护者的持有者都有投票权，这些人是**许多人**。\n   4. 守护者（前50名持有者）是唯一可以向DAO提出建议的用户，但他们不能对其进行投票，这些提案必须符合这三个标准中的全部或大部分。\n\n      **● 反对中心化。**\n\n      **●推动权力下放的事业**\n\n      **●直接有益于一项崇高的事业。**\n   5. 这些提案可以来自任何地方，风险投资公司、社区成员。 政治家、无政府主义者、社会主义者、右翼，只要他们符合上面的指导原则，并且是卫道士。 只要符合上述指导原则，并且是由守护者提交的，任何提案都可以被 任何提案都可以由““许多人”投票决定。\n   6. 提案必须包含：被投资方协议代币的总供应量，在总供应量中的百分比。 总供应量的百分比，作为对13个ETH投资的回报。 代币统计学，代币的审计和任何合约，**燃烧和分配计划**。\n   7. 燃烧和分配计划\\*1是被投资方协议代币的归属时间表。\n      协议的代币。对于这个例子，让我们使用一个假的协议**ABC DAO**。该分发计划可以是每天、每周、每两周或每月，但分发时间最多不超过18个月。\n   8. 假设ABC DAO承诺提供其$ABC代币的1.2%，每月分发一次，持续12个月。在还款日，被投资方并没有像普通的风险投资协议那样发送代币， 而是将其0.1%的$ABC供应量（12个月内为1.2%）交换为 $CULT。然后ABC DAO将一半的cult发送到烧钱的钱包，另一半发送到DAO。 一半给DAO，由DAO支付给dCULT持有人。\n   9. 如果一个提案已经被批准，并且达到了15.5CULT ETH的价值，它将自动发送13个ETH到提供的提案钱包地址，以及2.5个 ETH到烧钱钱包。\n  10. 如果一个提案没有被批准，CULT将继续积累超过15.5ETH水平，但一旦提案被批准，将自动发送。\n* **为什么守护者可以向DAO提交提案，但却不能投票决定投资协议？**\n\n  一些人的力量比另一些人的力量更强大。这一点不能被遗忘。\n* **什么类型的决定/投资会被CULT的决策者们通过投票？是否项目只能是基于加密货币/区块链的？**\n\n  我们将决定和被投资项目的性质留给守护者和“许多人”。我们只提供我们的愿景和指导，以及我们创建的该协议的用途。\n* **当投资协议达成时，我是否必须用我的CULT做质押，或我可以决定不质押吗？**\n\n  如果你想投票，那么你必须要有质押。你也只能从被投资公司获得奖励，如果你被盯上了，你也只能从被投资公司获得奖励。但是如果你不经行质押，你每一笔包含CULT的交易都会促进这项事业，每一次燃烧都会减少代币的供应。 都会减少代币的供应，增加其稀缺性。\n* **一个DAO提案必须遵守什么标准才有资格提交？**\n\n  我们遵循的准则是（**打击中心化，促进去中心化事业，直接受益于去中心化**）\n\n1. 被投资方协议代币的总供应量\n2. 作为对13个ETH的回报投资占总供应量的百分比\n3. 代币经济学\n4. 代币的审计和任何已建立的合约。\n5. 燃烧和分配计划\\*1\n\n* **在投资方面，什么构成了 \"崇高的事业\"？**\n  \"我的革命伙伴们，解放是一项崇高的事业。我们必须为获得它而奋斗。\"\n* **什么是 \"燃烧的机制\"？为什么我们要在每6万块钱中烧掉1万块？**\n\n  我们对区块链和加密货币市场的核心吸引力并不盲目。 用户挑选的代币的价格可能会大幅上涨。我们也清楚地知道以前的金融系统的伎俩，使许多人被压制，这就是为什么我们设计了燃烧系统，是为了使我们的经济模式过度通缩。\n* **为什么我们以50%燃烧和50%比例再分配的形式提供全部分配？**\n\n  我们许多人，是为人民服务的，把我们的信仰放在人民身上。我们资助那些愿意为我们的未来而战，并以我们的感激之情、社区支持和我们的信任来回报他们。 支持和我们的信任。反过来，他们燃烧了我们购买的一半代币，把它们送到一个黑洞钱包里。另一半则被以CULT的形式奖励给“许多人”。\n* **在重新分配给CULT持有者的50%中，用户可以把币复投换成到dCULT中。CULT 和 dCULT 的区别是什么？ 什么是dCULT?**\n\n  dCULT 是 \"质押证明 \"的代币。它是不可转让的。只有质押的用户，他们的cult将从dCULT中受益。当利润被发送到DAO时，拥有一定比例的dCULT 当利润被送到DAO时，拥有一定比例的dCULT，你就可以claim你的奖励，这将按照你的dCULT所有权比例支付。\n* **为什么被投资人的代币要通过转换为CULT代币进行再分配？ 如何商定支付的比率？**\n\n  被投资人的代币被转换成CULT，因为它创造了额外的交易，以及市场上额外的购买压力。付率是由被投资人协议提供，一旦被拒绝，可以再次提出建议。如果被拒绝的原因是由于不吸引人的回报率，那么被投资方协议可以修复并做出这些补偿。\n\n声明：将原文翻译成中文供大家学习参考，不代表本人同意其政治主张及其理念，dyor，Stay Safe。CULTDAO于2022/05/30发布RVLT，详情移步\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x8C01527C46f0adD00d4B52110b74e4A883590cA7/A_ZsuFiI23AS2DeaNbL34KU_W6q0u7HsviuZ_WsUvsk](https://mirror.xyz/0x8C01527C46f0adD00d4B52110b74e4A883590cA7/A_ZsuFiI23AS2DeaNbL34KU_W6q0u7HsviuZ_WsUvsk)\n\n[https://twitter.com/wearecultdao/status/1509527362773286912?s=20&t=9r-wbaCbc3vtrC6iE4ArpA](https://twitter.com/wearecultdao/status/1509527362773286912?s=20&t=9r-wbaCbc3vtrC6iE4ArpA)\n\n[https://www.lensfrens.xyz/iaezi.lens](https://www.lensfrens.xyz/iaezi.lens)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654300989, "digest": "3stKf-X2HfBCXoL6ANlApTdpCxMjfzet2xenEN-WKYw", "contributor": "0x8C01527C46f0adD00d4B52110b74e4A883590cA7"}

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem : Gatekeeping of the Cannabis Space = Integrity + Funding + Scalability**\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption.

As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery, farm, hash processing, and soon-to-launch retail of award-winning legacy products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks. Partnering with Uncle Mac’s, a Northern California craft cannabis brand, & South Face Management, parent company to Flower Wheel Nursery, South Face Farms Cultivation, and Uncle Mac’s brand.\n\n**Project #2 :** Onboard visual and 3D artists who will design branding and assets for the Metaverse and we develop cross-chain NFT’s to be dropped on various play-to-earn games. We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654301511, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem :** \n\n**Gatekeeping of the Cannabis Space = Integrity + Funding + Scalability**\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption. Information, data security, and their applications are essential for business optimization and transparency. Although there are many ERP solutions for the industry already, our governance will be centered around cannabis supply chain and DeFi dApps that utilize NFT-based SKU’s to generate active product data and create on-chain interactions that comply with ESG metrics, paving the way for global regulations and the future of the cannabis space.\n\nDeveloping Horticulture Public Goods : BIPOC Horticulture Initiative, Open-Source Library of Genetics, Strains and Phenos, Regenerative Farming Methods & Techniques, Cannabis Production, Processing, Entheogenic Cultivation, Medicinal Protocols, and a Community-Practitioner Directory\n\nCommunity-Governance over the liquidity, yield-farming, and major-user decisions in the tokenization of HASH DAO. \n\n**DERO Data Privacy** **+ Tokenization of Security**\n\nHASH DAO Governance is the future of the industry standard, and to do this we will start by partnering with one successful Emerald Triangle, Northern California craft cannabis-brand with community-staking of its future scaling of operations and expanding a compilation of automation protocols through smart contracts.\n\n**ON-CHAIN SUPPLY NFTs + ACTIVE INVENTORY TRACKING + CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS = Web3 Point of Sale (PoS)**\n\n**World’s First Cannabis DAO Founded On**:\n\nBIPOC-equity and engineered around community-development governed by craft cannabis operators, backed by IRL projects.\n\n**On-Chain Protocols + Smart Contracts = The Automated Horticulture of Tomorrow**\n\nCreating a future:\n\n* Geared to the love and cultivation of the plant and Mother Earth\n* Onboarding BIPOC leaders and creatives onto the blockchain\n* Compensating intellectual property proportionally to fulfill smart contracts\n\n> **HASH DAO = Power Back in Your Hands**\n\nReinvention of the Horticulture Supply Chain and Data Distribution via smart contracts that allow for automation and help individuals to create ownership over community-led projects, intellectual property, digital assets, and dApps.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M6C2p0sNHx37p783TEv9D.jpg?height=822&width=1125)\n\n**First Wins for HASH DAO**\n\n> “Community Ownership of Physical and Digital Assets”\n\nMinting a multi-tiered HASH DAO NFT with the top governance tier going for $10 K, raising a total of $11.5 M for an initial $HASH treasury. As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery, farm, hash processing, and soon-to-launch retail of award-winning legacy products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks. Partnering with Uncle Mac’s, a Northern California craft cannabis brand, & South Face Management, parent company to Flower Wheel Nursery, South Face Farms Cultivation, and Uncle Mac’s brand.\n\n**Project #2 :** Onboard visual and 3D artists who will design branding and assets for the Metaverse and we develop cross-chain NFT’s to be dropped on various play-to-earn games. We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654301615, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem :** \n\nA successful craft cannabis brand with artisanal integrity of the brand struggles to \n\nA successful craft cannabis brand struggles to find funding that will be preserve the artisanal integrity of the brand. Scalability is an absolute for any company to grow and distribute \n\ntypically, the capital solutions available often compromise the integrity and quality of the products at the expense of the small brands reputation, consumers, and Earth. \n\nOften times, the funding leads to once corporate and VC capital\n\nDAO’s solution is to provide decentralization and democratization of the cannabis space, \n\n**Gatekeeping of the Cannabis Space = Integrity + Funding + Scalability**\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption.

Scalability is an absolute for any company to grow\n\nDAO’s solution is to provide decentralization and democratization of the cannabis space, \n\n**Gatekeeping of the Cannabis Space = Integrity + Funding + Scalability**\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption. Information, data security, and their applications are essential for business optimization and transparency. Although there are many ERP solutions for the industry already, our governance will be centered around cannabis supply chain and DeFi dApps that utilize NFT-based SKU’s to generate active product data and create on-chain interactions that comply with ESG metrics, paving the way for global regulations and the future of the cannabis space.\n\nDeveloping Horticulture Public Goods : BIPOC Horticulture Initiative, Open-Source Library of Genetics, Strains and Phenos, Regenerative Farming Methods & Techniques, Cannabis Production, Processing, Entheogenic Cultivation, Medicinal Protocols, and a Community-Practitioner Directory\n\nCommunity-Governance over the liquidity, yield-farming, and major-user decisions in the tokenization of HASH DAO. \n\n**DERO Data Privacy** **+ Tokenization of Security**\n\nHASH DAO Governance is the future of the industry standard, and to do this we will start by partnering with one successful Emerald Triangle, Northern California craft cannabis-brand with community-staking of its future scaling of operations and expanding a compilation of automation protocols through smart contracts.\n\n**ON-CHAIN SUPPLY NFTs + ACTIVE INVENTORY TRACKING + CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS = Web3 Point of Sale (PoS)**\n\n**World’s First Cannabis DAO Founded On**:\n\nBIPOC-equity and engineered around community-development governed by craft cannabis operators, backed by IRL projects.\n\n**On-Chain Protocols + Smart Contracts = The Automated Horticulture of Tomorrow**\n\nCreating a future:\n\n* Geared to the love and cultivation of the plant and Mother Earth\n* Onboarding BIPOC leaders and creatives onto the blockchain\n* Compensating intellectual property proportionally to fulfill smart contracts\n\n> **HASH DAO = Power Back in Your Hands**\n\nReinvention of the Horticulture Supply Chain and Data Distribution via smart contracts that allow for automation and help individuals to create ownership over community-led projects, intellectual property, digital assets, and dApps.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M6C2p0sNHx37p783TEv9D.jpg?height=822&width=1125)\n\n**First Wins for HASH DAO**\n\n> “Community Ownership of Physical and Digital Assets”\n\nMinting a multi-tiered HASH DAO NFT with the top governance tier going for $10 K, raising a total of $11.5 M for an initial $HASH treasury. As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery, farm, hash processing, and soon-to-launch retail of award-winning legacy products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks. Partnering with Uncle Mac’s, a Northern California craft cannabis brand, & South Face Management, parent company to Flower Wheel Nursery, South Face Farms Cultivation, and Uncle Mac’s brand.\n\n**Project #2 :** Onboard visual and 3D artists who will design branding and assets for the Metaverse and we develop cross-chain NFT’s to be dropped on various play-to-earn games. We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654303200, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem :** \n\nA successful craft cannabis brand struggles to find funding that will preserve the artisanal integrity of the products, typically the capital solutions available often compromise the integrity and quality of the products at the expense of the small brands reputation, consumers, and Earth. \n\nScalability is an absolute for any company to grow and distribute \n\n \n\nOften times, the funding leads to once corporate and VC capital\n\nDAO’s solution is to provide decentralization and democratization of the cannabis space, \n\n**Gatekeeping of the Cannabis Space = Integrity + Funding + Scalability**\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit.

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem :** \n\nA successful craft cannabis brand with artisanal integrity struggles to navigate the extractive nature of the traditional corporate company structure. Typically the capital solutions available often compromise the integrity and quality of the products at the expense of the small brands reputation, consumers, and the Earth. \n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption.

As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery, farm, hash processing, and soon-to-launch retail of award-winning legacy products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks. Partnering with Uncle Mac’s, a Northern California craft cannabis brand, & South Face Management, parent company to Flower Wheel Nursery, South Face Farms Cultivation, and Uncle Mac’s brand.\n\n**Project #2 :** Onboard visual and 3D artists who will design branding and assets for the Metaverse and we develop cross-chain NFT’s to be dropped on various play-to-earn games. We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654304391, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}
{"id": "idhbTGtAZHc4CPmi7lNG9s7SM2gv_y_9AF0dC8YSlxY", "title": "No one is building the metaverse.", "body": "### 1. The metaverse is interconnected\n\nThese companies are not building the metaverse, they are building *metaWorlds.*\n\nThe metaverse is not built in siloes, not owned by a single company, nor exists on a single blockchain. Hence, no ***one*** is building the metaverse. NThe metaverse is by virtue of its tenents is open sourced, crowd funded, and a user generated experience. \n\nUsers and their avatars can freely explore from world to world.\n\nMetalistings (MLS) is the embodiment of this connected hyper reality.\n\n### 2. Virtual worlds vs the metaverse\n\nVirtual worlds have existed since the 2000s in games like World of Warcraft, Eve Online, Runescape, & Animal Crossing…\n\nThe difference now is ownership.\n\nWith NFTs, people could prove scarcity, non-fungability, and provenance.\n\nIf real estate was ownership in real life, then virtual land is ownership of the metaverse.\n\n### 3. Digital scarcity is a myth\n\nBut the scarcity of attention in the IoT is irrefutable.\n\nLike your iphone home page, valuable digital real estate exists, just in different mediums.\n\nWeb2 social media has shown us that people, with their finite attention, aggregate to social hubs.\n\nSuch is the case in the metaverse.\n\nCoding new land doesn’t mean people will go there - people go where other people are.\n\nThe scarcity of attention is the real reason why virtual real estate will continue to have value.\n\n### 4. Good virtual property is like a top level domain.\n\nHotels.com was worth $11M in 2001. Web traffic, ease of access through SEO, is now foot traffic, and ease of access through genesis plaza. Presently, the virtual Manhattan is on discount.\n\n### 5. Make new things old, and old things new\n\nThe easiest way to sell something new is to make it old.\n\nReal estate is an old.\n\nDrawing similarities between metaverses and real estate, we’ll onboard the next billion users.\n\n### 6. Since you cannot eat or sleep in virtual land…\n\nIt’s a place of social congregation and consumption. This is means that the metaverse is a new social layer. A place of experiences.\n\nLand is only as valuable as the experiences that are on the land.\n\nSo there is no such thing, now at least, as residential real estate. It’s all commercial.\n\n### 7. The metaverse is not escape, its a shift in consumer preferences\n\nGame worlds have been a place of refuge and retreat for the business of daily life. If we bring capitalism and financialization of all things into the metaverse, then should there not be a metaverse for the metaverse where people can escape to? In any case, metaverse exodus is a shift in consumer preferences. With enough of a movement, we could see a shift in ecologically nonsustainable consumer preferences move towards more of a virtual consumptive behavior.  \n\n### 8. Decentralized identities and proof of humanity will be the main two schools of thought that will clash in the metaverse\n\nThe third will be general AI.

{"id": "lWD8Aj8GB-nKk7Ormv4isi68xBfARxo08HhoDvfQWEc", "title": "No one is building the metaverse.", "body": "### 1. The metaverse is interconnected\n\nThese companies are not building the metaverse, they are building *metaWorlds.*\n\nThe metaverse is not built in siloes, not owned by a single company, nor exists on a single blockchain. Hence, no ***one*** is building the metaverse. The metaverse is, by virtue of its tenents, open sourced, crowd funded, and a user generated experience. \n\nUsers and their avatars can freely explore from world to world.\n\nMetalistings (MLS) is the embodiment of this connected hyper reality.\n\n### 2. Virtual worlds vs the metaverse\n\nVirtual worlds have existed since the 2000s in games like World of Warcraft, Eve Online, Runescape, & Animal Crossing…\n\nThe difference now is ownership.\n\nWith NFTs, people could prove scarcity, non-fungability, and provenance.\n\nIf real estate was ownership in real life, then virtual land is ownership of the metaverse.\n\n### 3. Digital scarcity is a myth\n\nBut the scarcity of attention in the IoT is irrefutable.\n\nLike your iphone home page, valuable digital real estate exists, just in different mediums.\n\nWeb2 social media has shown us that people, with their finite attention, aggregate to social hubs.\n\nSuch is the case in the metaverse.\n\nCoding new land doesn’t mean people will go there - people go where other people are.\n\nThe scarcity of attention is the real reason why virtual real estate will continue to have value.\n\n### 4. Good virtual property is like a top level domain.\n\nHotels.com was worth $11M in 2001. Web traffic, ease of access through SEO, is now foot traffic, and ease of access through genesis plaza. Presently, the virtual Manhattan is on discount.\n\n### 5. Make new things old, and old things new\n\nThe easiest way to sell something new is to make it old.\n\nReal estate is an old.\n\nDrawing similarities between metaverses and real estate, we’ll onboard the next billion users.\n\n### 6. Since you cannot eat or sleep in virtual land…\n\nIt’s a place of social congregation and consumption. This is means that the metaverse is a new social layer. A place of experiences.\n\nLand is only as valuable as the experiences that are on the land.\n\nSo there is no such thing, now at least, as residential real estate. It’s all commercial.\n\n### 7. The metaverse is not escape, its a shift in consumer preferences\n\nGame worlds have been a place of refuge and retreat for the business of daily life. If we bring capitalism and financialization of all things into the metaverse, then should there not be a metaverse for the metaverse where people can escape to? In any case, metaverse exodus is a shift in consumer preferences. With enough of a movement, we could see a shift in ecologically nonsustainable consumer preferences move towards more of a virtual consumptive behavior.  \n\n### 8. Decentralized identities and proof of humanity will be the main two schools of thought that will clash in the metaverse\n\nThe third will be general AI. But before then KYC and pseudo-anonymity are in conflict. Identity within the metaverse is the only user input that is constant throughout all of the different worlds. Property rights is linked to identity. ZK proofs are integral to resolving these differences in the metaverse. \n\n### 8. If you put all the metaWorlds on one platform:\n\nYou make it easier to understand their similarities and differences.

The Afropolitan Network is a Curator of Black and African:\n\n* Talent (recruit, partner up)\n* Culture (art, media, fashion)\n* Capital (investment DAOs)\n* Information (newsletter, blog, Twitter)\n* Experiences (events, curated offerings)\n\nNevertheless, we believe **our reach should exceed our grasp.** While it may be a humble Network today, Afropolitan will be the first-ever internet country in the future. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. First, you may be asking: why build a Digital Nation?\n\n## Why we’re building a Digital Nation\n\n***Each generation must, out of relative obscurity, discover its mission, fulfill it, or betray it.***\n\n— Frantz Fanon\n\nScarcity. Weakness. Poverty. Wherever we look and wherever we are, Africans worldwide are subjects, not citizens. Access to opportunity is scarce. Security is not guaranteed. For the most part, life is just about surviving, not thriving.\n\nWhat would you do if you could do anything? If your future was boundless, not *bounded*? What if your allegiance to a country did not depend on birth but on choice? In short: What would happen if you could come together with others to build a new society?\n\nWe know what you’re thinking: “This is unrealistic .” Everything around you, from the machine on which you’re reading this manifesto to the country you live in, was once an idea in somebody’s head. They only came to be thanks to the work of millions of people, no more intelligent or better than you.\n\nIn this spirit, and with humility and hope for the future, we Afropolitans declare:\n\n1. The nation-state experiment has failed for Black people worldwide. It has yielded nothing but poverty, genocide, police brutality, ethnic strife, inflation, weak government, and the failure of our ecosystems.\n2. All people who call themselves free have a ***fundamental right*** to create the society they want by choice collectively. As the internet enables us to shrink space and form bonds across the planet, no person should live in a society by accident or force.\n3. Finally, that **Abundance** and the destruction of scarcity is a North Star worth pursuing in any society which hopes to be both healthy and wealthy. Instead of the Land of Opportunity, we propose the **Network of Abundance**: Abundance of **Tools**, Abundance of **Opportunity**, Abundance of **Joy**.\n\n***To all future Afropolitans, our deal is simply this: join the Network of Abundance to be all you can be. Afropolitan is the canvas; you wield the brush.***\n\n## Strategy: How do you build a Digital Nation?\n\nHuman beings are social animals. All that is good and noble about us stems from the fact that we need each other. In the most basic sense, building a new country is a process of scaling a social network around a shared mission and principles. Social networks are formed online and tend to stay there in our time. But what if we built a new network and migrated it into the real world via a city (or Network of cities)?\n\nCrypto-philosopher [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis) highlighted this as the most viable strategy to build such a country — which he calls a [Network State](https://1729.com/how-to-start-a-new-country) — in the 21st Century. The Network State is a digital nation launched first as an online community before materializing physically on land after reaching critical mass.\n\nThe internet enables people to organize around shared values at scales that were previously unthinkable before the current century. If it were a country, Facebook would be the largest one globally. With the advent of cryptocurrency, the next Facebook will not be a social network with a passive online community but rather a full-blown digital republic coordinated by its native currency and a unifying mission.\n\nWhat, then, could Afropolitan be? If it were a country, the African diaspora would be the 10th largest globally (\\~ 150 Million). The diaspora is our North Star.\n\n## \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/upjbTXTKVOGANrIHVvKZc.jpeg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n## Master Plan\n\nThe best way to reform an obsolete system is by building a newer, more straightforward system. Afropolitan’s objective is to solve the Crisis of Legitimacy experienced by Africans worldwide by building a new source of ***Legitimacy embodied in our Digital Nation***.\n\nWe will do so in four phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Network\n\nIn Phase 1, we seed our Network by communicating a clear and energetic vision for the world we want to build. We will drop an NFT campaign outlining mythology for our new nation. Afropolitan NFTs will also grant members a digital passport, alongside access to events and future value-added services.\n\n### Phase 2: Come for the Network, Stay for the Tool\n\n**Speaking of value-added services:** Beyond the diaspora, scaling the Afropolitan Network will require providing maximal utility to our members. In Phase 2, we will launch the **Afropolitan Super App** to bring together all the utilities within the Afropolitan ecosystem under one roof. Members will be able to monitor their holdings, send money to anyone across borders, earn by contributing to the DAO, and buy goods and services. Most importantly, they will be able to watch the Network as it grows around the world, thanks to a native media feed. The whole thing will feel like a ***movement***.\n\n### Phase 3: Minimum Viable State\n\nPhase 3 is about preparing for our transition from the digital to the virtual. Our goal at this stage is to **build up legitimacy through state capacity.** We will create a network of seed institutions to govern our Network, including subsidiary funds, organizations, and a developing internal economy.\n\n### Phase 4: Foundation\n\nFinally, in Phase 4, we leverage the Network, capital, and legitimacy accrued over the last 3 Phases to acquire land in negotiation with partner governments. The land piece will look like a “Chinatown/Afropolitan Town” where our members can establish a physical presence and create economic opportunities. At this stage, the Network State will serve as the “digital capital” which governs our physical Districts. Eventually, we will build a more extensive network of Charter Cities akin to Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\n## I’m in. What’s next?\n\nWe are embarking on a long and taxing journey. Our destination may be clear, but the path is uncertain. As we launch Phase 1, Afropolitan is looking to onboard the most dedicated and ambitious people to join our fledgling Network. We care less about what you’ve done and more about who you aspire to become and how we can all be better together.\n\nTo get involved, join our [mailing list](https://www.afropolitan.io/) first to get a sense of our [community](https://linktr.ee/afropolitangroup).

{"id": "9UAnmo6ryYlsLLIYnoIgkiw1FsXT5STr5Bbq7Iat_Vw", "title": "Building With Content", "body": "By now the growth strategy for PRST should be pretty obvious--at least I hope it is. Otherwise, I’ve been spending a lot of time publicly creating content for myself. \n\nCreating content is the only way I know how to start growing a business.\n\nIt was a major part of how I grew my financial planing firm, **[RLS Wealth](https://www.rlswealth.com/)**. It was unintentionally how my co-founder, Taylor Schulte, and I started **[The AGC](https://advisorgc.com/)**. It was instrumental in establishing my small place in the financial planning community and bridging into other communities outside of finance. \n\nI’m not an aggressive salesperson. \n\nI’m not going to cold call. I’m not going to spend tons of dollars buying keywords or social media ads (at least not right now). I’m not going to force anything I do on anyone. I’d rather focus on those who are already with me and let other find me when the time is right. Creating content is perfect for this.\n\nI’ll rely on educating, sharing, and just being myself in blogs, podcasts, videos, and other content to allow people who have an interest in what I’m doing find me. I believe if you put good content out, focus on giving information away and showing your expertise, and take care of the people working with or supporting you, good things will happen--I can’t be convinced it won’t work. I’ve not only watched this play out for many people but I’ve experienced it myself--and once I saw that it works, there was no turning back for me.\n\n*Disclaimer: That’s not to say other ways of growing a business won’t work and that content creation should the ONLY way to market--I don’t live in a world of absolutes.* \n\nThankfully, I love creating content. If I could, I’d spend all day every day creating content of one form or another. Some days it would be writing the blogs for the topics I have written down in my ideas notebook. Others it would be having conversations with interesting people for the podcast. And sometimes it would be shooting videos and taking photos to create more Shorts showing what a passion led life can look like. \n\nFor some creating content is work. For me, it’s a creative outlet that just so happens to fuel my businesses.\n\n## PRST Is A Little Different\n\nGrowing PRST through content is going to be a little different than it was growing RLS Wealth. When marketing a financial planning firm through education and content, a creator is not only able to begin to build relationships with their readers/listeners, who are potential future clients, but she is also able to establish herself as an expert and show her professional knowledge. The end result is eventually some of the readers/listeners will reach out to the advisor for help when they have a financial event that requires help. There is a service that is on the other end of the content.\n\nIf you **[revisit the blog post that discusses the current roadmap for PRST](https://mirror.xyz/prst.eth/l7gyXfwGNrrAyz1yHKQpR5OXHEAPpl6ulyjWF2kITps)**, right now it’s only content and merchandise. But you can see there is more to come. \n\nFor now, despite having an audience from my content as a financial advisor, I’m focused right now on helping individuals for whom PRST will resonate with find it. I’m sure there will be some overlap with RLS Wealth clients, All About Your Benjamins subscribers, and followers on social media but for the most part, PRST is starting from ground zero. \n\nAnd ground zero is blogging, podcasting, and creating videos.\n\n## PRST Content Every Day\n\nBeginning next week, PRST will be publishing content 7 days a week. \n\nCurrently, there is The Daily PRST podcast which drops Mon-Thursday and should only take up 5-7 minutes of your time. On Fridays The PRST drops. On Saturdays The Weekly PRST hits inboxes **[(if you’re not getting it you can sign up here)](https://skilled-experimenter-2294.ck.page/accf900c37)**. On Our PRST is an interview format podcast that does not have a regular cadence.\n\nAnd starting June 12th, 2022 there will be a new audio-only show (titled TBD) exclusively on the new PRST Amazon Skill powered by our friends at WealthVoice. **[You can subscribe to the PRST Skill](https://alexa-skills.amazon.com/apis/custom/skills/amzn1.ask.skill.6016ffd0-81ae-4a50-aa58-dd68a0d00535/launch)** available on your Amazon devices and make PRST a part of your morning routine--each day the podcasts will be available on your Amazon device and it will be the only place to catch the Sunday episodes where we’ll dive deeper into some of the spiritual components of your Pursuit. \n\nNext week we’ll announce the PRST Skill, so you’re getting a little sneak peek at what’s to come by reading the blog.\n\nI’ll never stop creating content for PRST, even after the remainder of the roadmap is filled in and we are helping more individuals and families find and follow their passions to more fulfilled and happier lives.\n\nFor now, it’s back to creating…I’ve got a newsletter to finish for tomorrow morning.\n\nKeep Pursuing,\n\nJC", "timestamp": 1654305090, "digest": "cMqA1fhE8BLNwx3o6yUAbQ2JTHkOV8RDaPKy5XvYk9I", "contributor": "0x828A0d185f1Fa399bfAd4262f498ac3225F577Cd"}

Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654304996, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

{"id": "YdkSGmZfrBNTG2gR4Lku1RtLEDcyltqsItvxtUAbpwM", "title": "HASH DAO ($HASH) Whitepaper", "body": "*Updated : May 2022*\n\n**Mission : Our mission is to cultivate Web3 community horticulture for the future of the cannabis space.** \n\nHASH DAO provides the first unified DAO solution for craft cannabis farmers, industry professionals, investors, and BIPOC communities interested in the cannabis space.\n\nHASH DAO has been created to allow integration into the emerging technologies of the blockchain and Web3 into the cannabis space. Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem**  \n\nA successful craft cannabis brand with artisanal integrity struggles to navigate the extractive nature of the traditional corporate company structure. Typically the capital solutions available often compromise the integrity and quality of the products at the expense of the small brands reputation, consumers, and the Earth. \n\n***Solution***\n\nMerging Web3 technologies with the cannabis space and creating a decentralized and democratized opportunities for companies to raise capital.\n\n> **Opportunity**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over [$200 Billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cannabis-sector-could-grow-to-200-billion-in-a-decade-say-stifel-analysts-2019-07-02) and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market.

12:59\n七千人大会是在中共执政后首次出现全面经济危机和全国非正常死亡人数巨大的背景下召开的。\n\n对于造成这次经济危机的根本原因, 在召开会议伊始, 众多参加者就有一种潜在的强烈问责情绪。但是这种情绪一直压抑着, 从1962年1月11日至1月27日的半个月之中, 没有一个中央政治局委员作过自我反省和检讨。刘少奇在代表党中央所作的书面政治报告中, 对产生困难的根本原因也未能正面客观地加以论述。对此, 党的各级干部有着强烈地抵触情绪。这个局面在1月18日大会文件起草委员会上才有变化, 周恩来对如何究责问题的表态与彭真直接提出的追究毛泽东的一点责任的究责态度相呼应, 使大会顺利地进入了相对实质性阶段, 巧妙地倒逼毛泽东作出了早应作的检讨, 使“调整、巩固、充实、提高”的八字方针得到实质性执行。《周恩来传 》也认为, 从1月19日至2月7日, 七千人大会进入第二阶段。周恩来的努力是形成这种有利的政治局面的重要原因之一。\n在七千人大会上, 如何认识承担大饥荒的政治责任, 在中央政治局内部可以依据各自的态度分为两派;其一是诿责派, 以毛泽东、林彪、柯庆施等为代表, 不认为“三面红旗”有什么不对, 认为不是决策正确与否的问题, 而是执行是否走样的问题。责任在除毛泽东以外的中央领导人和省地县各级党组织。另一派以刘少奇、周恩来、彭真为代表, 认为从中央到地方各有其责, 是究责派。但是在究责派中, 又有方式方法的差异。刘少奇和彭真是直接究责派;周恩来和邓小平是间接究责派, 倒逼派。而对这三方面作相应分析, 就可以看出周恩来如何巧妙地把究责与自责相结合, 达到以己检讨逼毛泽东“罪己”的目的。从而可以澄清有些文章把周恩来的态度同林彪的讲话视为同一性质的错误观点。\n图片\n\n一\n从1959年庐山会议后, 毛泽东对于自己提出的“三面红旗”之正确性与否, 内心里也并非底气十足的, 尤其是对于大跃进的问题。在庐山会议上, 他也曾赌气式地说过我是“成事不足, 败事有余”之类的话, 而在当时整个经济的严重问题尚未全面显现。从1959年到1961年饿死人的问题已在全国有广泛性, 这迫使毛泽东不得不对自己的决策作出相应地反思, 是方针决策失误, 还是决策执行走样?是自己应该主动承担这一政治责任, 还是整个执行层都难逃其责?在“三面红旗”之中, 毛泽东尤感不安的是“大跃进”问题, 他认为, 大跃进的方向没错, 就是自己急于求成, 急了点 (邓小平语) ;是执行层欺骗了自己, 才形成了当时的困难局面。所以毛泽东认为, 自己的大方向始终没有错。但是死了几千万人, 作为执政党的主席, 也是难逃担责之嫌。面对如此之大的经济危机, 让自己主动检讨, 实在非内心所愿, 但不检讨又没法向全党交待, 正是在这种矛盾心态下毛泽东同意召开七千人大会。因此是否要究责, 如何让毛泽东主动地承担其责任, 以向全党作一个交代, 这个难题就摆到了中央政治局面前。\n七千人大会召开之初, 彭真是中央政治局委员, 也是主持中央书记处常务工作的, 他认为, 过去几年工作中的重大失误的责任应该由中央书记处来承担。因此在1962年1月18日大会文件讨论时, 他第一个首先提出了政治究责问题, 责任承担者是否包括“主席、少奇和中央常委”的问题。尤其对于毛泽东是否应该承担责任的问题, 彭真是力主承担的。针对近一个月来毛泽东并没有主动作自我批评和主动“罪己”, 没有积极承担责任的态度, 彭真的确表现出了很大的政治勇气:“毛主席也不是什么错误也没有。”“如果毛主席百分之一, 千分之一的错误, 不检讨, 将给我们党留下恶劣影响。”\\[1\\] 彭真的“逼宫”之言, 直接把毛泽东推到了负政治责任的前台, 使毛泽东处境颇为尴尬。有文章指出:从事后看, 彭真的这番讲话成为最后迫使毛泽东在大会上公开承担责任的重要压力之一\\[1\\] , 事实确实如此。但是, 光有彭真讲话的压力, 还不足以让毛泽东主动检讨, 其原因正如前面分析过的, 毛泽东并不认为自己决策的大方向有任何问题, 所以, 他在内心并不认同彭真的说法。在此前的中央工作会议上, 毛泽东曾为责任承担问题定过基调:责任在中央和省这两级。毛泽东的意思很明显, 中央的责任是主要的, 但中央的责任应由政治局全体来承担, 所以, 作为政治局主席, 他只能抽象地承担职务性责任, 这一点毛泽东在七千人大会之前, 在党内会议上原则性地有所表示。要毛泽东公开地首先在他人压力之下主动承担经济危机的具体责任, 并非毛泽东所愿。在毛泽东看来, 如此行为, 就等于在别人的压力下屈服, 这既不符合其性格特点, 也不符合“现实”。从毛泽东本人对经济危机性质的认识和毛泽东的性格来看, 直接究责要达到目的显然是有问题的。那么怎样才能“体面地”让毛泽东主动下“罪己”诏, 从而为统一全党的思想认识创造条件?鉴于毛泽东当时在党内的个人权威和权力的不可动摇和不可挑战性, 即便达到目的, 其副作用之大也是不可低估的。正是出于这一战略性思考, 周恩来对彭真为代表的直接究责方式表示了一定程度的异议:周恩来认为, 政治责任问题具有很大的敏感性, 会触及毛泽东个人性格和政治嗅觉的敏感神经, 搞得不好又会造成党内分裂并给今后的上层决策再次埋下祸根。责是要究的, 但更要注意策略问题。庐山会议的前车之鉴就是一个典型例证。所以, 中央常委主动承担责任, 达成意见一致, 从而制定出更有效的纠错政策和措施, 使国民经济重新走上健康轨道比硬压毛泽东承担责任更有意义。此外, 中央常委各自承担了责任, 那么, 毛泽东也没有理由不承担相应的责任。只有其他中央常委主动承担责任, 毛泽东才会有个台阶下, 也会相应承担其责, 这是一种表面上妥协, 实际上更有利于解决问题的方式。如何把直接究责采取一种变通方式来加以实现, 周恩来走出了极为策略的一步棋:表面上质疑彭真的政治责任追究立场, 实际上逼迫毛泽东检讨。他在1月18日的大会文件起草委员会上说:“主观上的错误, 要着重讲违反毛泽东思想, 个别问题是我们供给材料、情况有问题, 应当由我们负责。如果不违反‘三面红旗’、毛泽东思想, 的确成绩会大一些。”\\[1\\] 周的这一段话是什么意思呢?仅从字面上看, 似乎在替毛泽东辩护, 若仔细分析, 就有弦外之音, 就是话中有话, 颇有值得玩味之处:“主观上的错误, 要着重讲违反毛泽东思想”, 意即之所以造成如此大的经济危机, 形成如此之大的经济困难, 并非天灾, 而是人祸, 是中央在决策思想上的重大失误造成的。这就与刘少奇在1月27日大会文字报告之后所作的口头报告上给这次经济危机的定性一致, 刘少奇认为, “一个指头和九个指头”的分析已不具有广泛性, 而是“三份天灾, 七份人祸”, 人祸自然是主观决策上的错误, 亦包括执行中的失误。而造成失误的根本原因是违反了毛泽东思想, 这个毛泽东思想显然不是近几年来毛泽东的所思、所想、所为了。而是指过去在民主集中制基础上已在七届二中全会之前形成的, 以实事求是为核心的毛泽东思想, 并非毛泽东在建国后的个人意志的一系列表现。是谁违反了毛泽东思想呢?这一点在政治局常委中, 可谓心照不宣。因为从建国伊始的一系列“左”的政策, 如对资本主义工商业为中心的“三大改造”, 反右, 庐山会议, 反右倾, 社会主义建设的总路线, 大跃进, 人民公社等, 无不是毛泽东亲历亲为的。尤其是“三面红旗”, 是毛泽东顶着中央政治局常委中多数人意见而一意孤行的。很显然, 毛泽东自己为始作俑者, 违反了过去自己一贯提倡的“实事求是”的思想, 陷入了主观主义的思想路线之中。中央其他常委的责任只是在个别问题上有错误, 并且只有提供材料不准确、有水份的错误, 但不应负主要决策的错误。更有趣的是, 周恩来把“三面红旗”和毛泽东思想分开来讲的作法, 更是不同寻常的。以毛泽东的观点, “三面红旗”应是毛泽东思想中很闪光的一页, 是自己的建设社会主义的一个创造, 理应包括在毛泽东思想之中, 而周恩来把二者单独列出, 正是为了显示出其区别。在这里, “三面红旗”只是一个幌子, 只是字面上的, 并不具有实际的性质, 这一点, 在其后的主动检讨的观点之中得到了“呼应”。\n图片\n\n二\n如果说, 以上分析显得有些“强词夺理”的话, 那么, 随后周恩来的主动检讨则更是对其表态之真实理念作了前后一致的“呼应”, 亦显出“倒逼”之意, 印证了他的这一段话的真意:他对大会政治报告所列的12条基本经验教训中提出了重要的补充意见\\[2\\] 。这些意见有着明显的指向:\n关于总路线问题, 他提出, 执行总路线, 要阐明鼓足干劲力争上游和实事求是, 多快和好省, 数量和质量, 需要和可能之间的相互联系及相互制约的关系, 说明这几年来所发生的缺点和错误是违反总路线和两条腿走路的方针造成的。意即只讲多快不讲好省。\n关于高速度和按比例发展社会主义经济的问题, 他提出, 应该说明:“要在基本上保证吃、穿、用的基础上的建设高速度, 也就是消费和积累放在适当的比例上, 才有可能和持久。否则就难以维持简单再生产, 更谈不上扩大再生产。要作到既有高速度又能按比例发展生产, 就必须加强计划性, 进行国民经济的综合平衡工作。”为了加强此意见的权威性, 他要求把列宁“经常的, 自觉保持的平衡实际上就是计划性”这一段话加写进去。\n针对工业与农业脱节的问题, 他提出原文中工业发展的规模, 必须同农业所能提供的农产品 (包括粮食和原料) 相适应“这句话后面应加上”和劳动力或运输力和购买力等字样。\n关于人民公社体制, 周恩来建议把“所有制的改变要根据生产力发展水平和农民觉悟程度来决定的意思补写进去”。\n关于民主集中制的论述, 他认为“不够确切”, 建议改写为“集中统一和分级管理, 中央集权和地方分权统一的国家计划和发挥地方积极性”问题。\n上述五个方面的补充建议, 都是采用“以子之矛, 攻子之盾”的方法, 隐含了毛泽东在反冒进基础上的左倾错误:\n在“总路线”问题上, 只讲鼓足干劲力争上游, 忘却了实事求是;只讲多快, 忽略好省, 结果欲速而不达。只讲数量, 不讲质量, 只讲需要, 不讲可能。说白了就是这次经济危机完全是执行总路线时的主观唯心主义泛滥造成的, 这就给所谓的“总路线”定了性。\n周恩来对“大跃进”的评价也是开门见山:高速度是按比例的高速度, 是以综合平衡为特征的, 计划性是高速度的前提条件, 高速度是以保证人民生活水平的提高为基础的。这就说明了大跃进是违反基本经济目标和规律的。对人民公社的体制的建议, 周恩来更是一针见血:用生产力水平和人民觉悟程度 (实际上是人民的满意程度) 来作为改变所有制的标准, 这就基本否定了人民公社的合理性。\n从上面分析可以看出, 对于“三面红旗”的态度, 周恩来是从马克思主义的基本原理来衡量评价的。只不过在方法上是抽象肯定, 具体否定, 以子之矛, 攻子之盾, 表现出了高度的策略性。即达到了表面上维护毛泽东的威信, 让毛泽东不丢面子, 有个台阶可下;实质上又批评了毛泽东的错误, 无形之中达到了向毛泽东问责的目的。对于周恩来的策略, 邓小平是心领神会的, 他在会议期间也是巧妙地引用毛泽东本人讲过的话, 来委婉地表明毛泽东并不是不犯错误的圣人:“错误、缺点都有。”言外之意即毛泽东不能不负一定的责任。\n图片\n\n三\n有文章提出, 周恩来在七千人大会上1月18日的讲话, 同林彪1月27日的讲话一样, 是直接为毛泽东开脱政治责任的, 二者没有根本的区别\\[1\\] 。更多的文章, 更是为尊者讳, 尽量避免提周恩来的讲话, 似乎林对周的讲话有遥相呼应之意, 应是周恩来的政治污点, 有损周恩来的政治形象。上述观点咋看起来似有理, 但若辩证分析起来却是不能成立的。那么林彪是如何替毛泽东解围的呢?当七千人大会上人们广泛把矛盾指向毛泽东, 要其负主要政治责任, 毛泽东处境尴尬时, 林彪于1月27日在大会上发表讲话:“事实证明, 这些困难在某些方面恰恰是由于我们没有按毛主席的指示, 毛主席的警告, 毛主席思想去做。如果听毛主席的话, 体会毛主席的精神, 那么弯路就会走的少, 今天的困难就少得多。”\\[3\\]393对此讲话与周恩来表态的本质区别, 可以从三个方面来分析, 一是具体提法的差别, 二是各自在此之前的政治态势中的所处状态, 三是后来的历史的验证。\n以具体提法的区别而言, 首先从字面上的对比可以看出, 林彪的讲话, 同周恩来的讲话, 似乎相似, 但仔细考证, 二者是有很大差别的。这种差别表现于二者提法的微妙差异, 俗话说, 差之毫厘, 谬之千里。周恩来讲的是违反毛泽东思想。是委婉批评毛泽东违反了集体结晶的毛泽东思想, 违反了实事求是、群众路线、集体领导原则。后者则是为毛泽东直接而绝对地说好话, 开脱政治责任, 并且把责任直接归于全党, 有护驾之意。二者的这种区别在以后的文化大革命中完全显现出来。\n至于背景不同的是, 从1956年开始, 党内高层多数是与毛泽东的反“反冒进”思想一致的, 当时只有周恩来、陈云等少数人看到了冒进的危险。\\[4\\]1230, 1235林彪更是与毛泽东保持高度一致, 庐山会议林彪之所以是毛泽东搬去的“救兵”, 根本在于两人思想上的一致性。可以说, 七千人大会林彪的表态同庐山会议上的性质完全相同。周恩来的情况则与之完全相反, 自从1958年1月之后的广州会议、南宁会议、八大二次会议上, 周被毛泽东多次指责批判为右倾机会主义以来, 一直是党内“保守”的少数, 甚至到了要被迫辞去总理一职的境地。对于“三面红旗”的来龙去脉及其严重后果, 周恩来有其切身的感受和认识。所以周恩来在问责问题上的表态, 与林彪是完全不同的。从历史的检验来看, 二者更是泾渭分明。1962年前后及文化大革命中周恩来与林彪各自的态度与其在七千人大会上的态度是一脉相承的。这已为实际所证明。\n可以直接佐证于此的是1962年2月3日, 周恩来在福建小组会上的讲话:“这几年来, 党风不纯, 产生了浮夸和说假话的现象。我们要提倡说真话。怎样才能作到这一点呢?要大家讲真话, 首先要领导上喜欢听真话, 反对说假话。如果你乱压任务, 结果象同志们所说的, 他就会准备两本账, 揣摩一下才讲, 看你喜欢听什么再讲什么, 这的确是一个党风问题。大家都说假话, 看领导脸色说话, 那不就同旧社会的官场习气一样了嘛?你们反映的情况我听起来很痛心。你们说假话当然不对, 但更主要的是我们压你们。从现在起, 不要乱压任务, 乱戴帽子了。要提倡讲真话, 即便讲过了火也要听。唐朝皇帝李世民, 能听魏征的反对意见, ‘兼听则明’, 把唐朝搞得兴旺起来。他们是君臣关系, 还能做到这样, 我们是同志关系, 就更应该能听真话了。”\\[4\\]1618\n从周恩来的这段切中时弊的发言中, 人们明显感到了他一贯的思想和主动承担责任的高风亮节。但其矛头所指也是明确的, 即政治责任应该主要由中央常委会负, 由政治局主席来负, 下级的“五风”是上级的主观主义与官僚主义压出来的。五风的始作俑者, 是中央, 责任大小应该是明确的。紧接着, 周恩来又讲了一段耐人寻味的话:“说真话, 鼓真劲, 做实事, 收实效。这四句话归纳起来就是实事求是。……它代表了毛泽东同志的一个根本思想。这四句话虽然简单, 却包含了丰富的思想。如何做到实事求是?首先要通过认真的调查研究, 以现在造成的这种形势, 一定要改变, 要下决心改变。要搞好调查研究就要真正联系群众。”\\[4\\]1619周这一段话, 表面上是用毛泽东的话来说事, 而实际上是批评了毛泽东在1956年以后的作为违背了他本人曾提倡的“实事求是”的作风, 严重脱离了群众。\n与此完全不同的是, 林彪在1959年庐山会议帮毛泽东“救火”被升任为中共中央和中央军委副主席、国务院副总理兼国防部长以后, 成为提倡学习毛主席思想、带头搞个人崇拜的始作俑者。早在七千人大会之前的1960年9月一次军委扩大会议上, 林彪就向全军发出号召, 军队要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗, 掀起开展学习毛泽东思想的新高潮, 把学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位。这次军委扩大会议形成的以学习毛主席著作为中心内容的决议, 得到了毛泽东的批准, 并由中共中央军委发至全国各省、直辖市、自治区, 直接推动了全国范围内的对毛泽东的个人崇拜。1961年4月, 林彪更是明确指示, 《解放军报》应当刊登毛主席语录。1962年又在扩大的中央工作会议上介绍了全军学习毛主席语录的做法, 博得毛泽东的首肯。根据林彪的旨意, 《解放军报》于1964年1月5日摘编了《毛主席语录200条》, 装订成册, 后改为267条的《毛主席语录》, 广为发行。林彪为了进一步彰显自己的态度, 高兴地为《毛主席语录》题了词, 即“读毛主席的书, 听毛主席的话, 照毛主席的指示办事, 做毛主席的好战士”。从此, 《毛主席语录》风靡全国, 对毛泽东的崇拜也更加广泛。可以说, 从庐山会议开始, 经七千人大会至文化大革命, 林彪不遗余力、挖空心思地制造毛泽东的个人崇拜, 可见其思想是一贯的。\n图片\n\n所以综合分析, 周恩来1962年1月18日的讲话同林彪1月27日的讲话具有完全不同的性质, 人们不难看出, 周恩来是用“以子之矛, 攻子之盾”的策略, 指出毛泽东所犯的错误。从表面上看, 周恩来的态度是温和的, 但作为当事人的毛泽东, 尤其是在先前逼周恩来多次检讨“反冒进”问题的毛泽东, 在自己始作俑搞出的巨大经济灾难面前, 岂能不知周恩来的矛头所向和良苦用心。所以在周恩来讲话以后, 毛泽东并未立即表态, 他还要看一看, 但是他内心清楚, 在形式上自己承担主要责任已在所难免, 检讨只是时机的选择问题。终于在1月30日作了自我批评:“凡是中央犯的错误, 直接归我负责, 间接的我也有份;因为我是中央主席。”“第一个负责的应当是我。”\\[3\\]392尽管充满了责任虚悬的味道, 但这在中共历史上是罕见的, 毛泽东检讨了, 党内反左、反冒进的思想就统一了。以大压工业指标, 包产到户为核心的“调整、巩固、充实、提高”的八字方针才得以贯彻, 在较短的时期内改变了普遍的饥饿状态, 使国民经济走上了快速恢复的轨道。从1961年至1966年国内形势的发展也可以看出“八字方针”取得了较好成绩。这一段历史, 但凡1950年代前后出生者皆有深切的体会。从执政党危机的严重性而言, 怎么评价七千人大会都不为过。对七千人大会统一思想的作用而言, 周恩来是功不可没的。\n",

amount0Out;\nuint256 balance1 = IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this)) - amount1Out;\n...\n```\n\n这是我们上面谈到的持续产品检查。我们预计该合约代币余额与其储备不同（余额将很快保存到储备中），我们需要确保它们的乘积等于或大于当前储备的乘积。如果满足此要求，则：\n\n1. 调用者正确计算了汇率（包括滑点）。\n2. 输出量是正确的。\n3. 转入合约的金额也是正确的\n\n```\n...\nif (balance0 * balance1 < uint256(reserve0_) * uint256(reserve1_))\n    revert InvalidK();\n...\n```\n\n现在可以安全地将代币转移给调用者并更新储备。整个交换逻辑就完成了。\n\n```\n    _update(balance0, balance1, reserve0_, reserve1_);\n\n    if (amount0Out > 0) _safeTransfer(token0, to, amount0Out);\n    if (amount1Out > 0) _safeTransfer(token1, to, amount1Out);\n\n    emit Swap(msg.sender, amount0Out, amount1Out, to);\n}\n```\n\n> 请记住，此方案并不完整：你会发现合约不收取交易费用，因此流动性提供者无法从其资产中获得利润。我们将在实施价格计算后填补这一空白。\n\n## 价格预言机\n\n预言机的想法，将区块链与链下服务连接起来的桥梁，以便可以从智能合约中查询现实世界的数据，已经存在了很长一段时间。Chainlink 是最大的预言机网络之一，创建于 2017 年，如今，它是许多 DeFi 应用程序的关键部分。\n\nUniswap 虽然是一个链上应用程序，但也可以作为一个预言机。交易者他们通过最小化交易所之间的价格差异来赚钱。套利者使 Uniswap 的价格尽可能接近中心化交易所的价格，这也可以被视为将价格从中心化交易所馈送到区块链。为什么不利用这个事实将配对合约变成价格预言机呢？这就是 Uniswap V2 中所做的。\n\nUniswap V2 中价格预言机提供的这种价格称为时间加权平均价格，或 TWAP。它基本上允许在两个时刻之间获得平均价格。为了实现这一点，合约存储了累计价格：在每次交换之前，它计算当前边际价格（不包括费用），将它们乘以自上次交换以来经过的秒数，然后将该数字添加到前一个数字中。\n\n那么价格的计算公式是什么呢？\n\n![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/filess/img14@main/2022/05/19/1652964543993-c701e97d-88fe-4569-bfed-13fffc03f93f.png)\n\n对于预言机功能，Uniswap V2 使用边际价格，它不包括滑点和交换手续费，也不取决于交换的数量，由于solidity中并不原生支持小数，Uniswap采用UQ112.112这种编码方式来存储价格信息。UQ112.112意味着该数值采取224位来编码值，前112位存放小数点前的值，后112位存放小数点后的值，Uniswap 选择UQ112.112的原因：因为UQ112.112可以被存储位uint224，这会留下32位的空闲Storage插槽位。再一个是每个Pair合约的reserve0和reserve1都是Uint112，同样会留下32位的空闲插槽位。特别的是pair合约的reserve连同最近一个区块的时间戳一起存储时，该时间戳会对$2^{32}$取余数称为uint32格式的数值。加之，尽管在任意给定时刻的价格都是UQ112.112格式，保证为uint224位，一段时间累积的价格并不是该格式。在储存插槽中末端的额外的32位可以用来储存累积的价格的溢出部分。这种设计意味着在每一个区块的第一笔交易中只需要额外的三次SSTORE操作（目前的开销是15000gas）\n在计算价格累计的时候我们需要一个变量，它将存储上次交换（或实际上是保留更新）时间戳。然后我们需要修改更新功能。\n\n```\nuint32 private blockTimestampLast;\n\nfunction _update(\n    uint256 balance0,\n    uint256 balance1,\n    uint112 reserve0_,\n    uint112 reserve1_\n) private {\n    ...\n    unchecked {\n        uint32 timeElapsed = uint32(block.timestamp) - blockTimestampLast;\n\n        if (timeElapsed > 0 && reserve0_ > 0 && reserve1_ > 0) {\n            price0CumulativeLast +=\n                uint256(UQ112x112.encode(reserve1_).uqdiv(reserve0_)) *\n                timeElapsed;\n            price1CumulativeLast +=\n                uint256(UQ112x112.encode(reserve0_).uqdiv(reserve1_)) *\n                timeElapsed;\n        }\n    }\n\n    reserve0 = uint112(balance0);\n    reserve1 = uint112(balance1);\n    blockTimestampLast = uint32(block.timestamp);\n\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n## 存储优化\n\n这是什么奇怪的 uint112 类型？为什么不使用 uint256？答案是：气体优化。\n\n每个 EVM 操作都会消耗一定量的 gas。简单的运算，比如算术运算，消耗的 gas 很少，但有些运算会消耗大量的 gas。最昂贵的是 SSTORE ——为合约存储节省价值。它的对应物 ,SLOAD也 很昂贵。因此，如果智能合约开发人员尝试优化其合约的 gas 消耗，这对用户是有益的。使用 uint112 储备变量正是为了这个目的。\n\n看看我们是如何布置变量的：\n\n```\naddress public token0;\naddress public token1;\n\nuint112 private reserve0;\nuint112 private reserve1;\nuint32 private blockTimestampLast;\n\nuint256 public price0CumulativeLast;\nuint256 public price1CumulativeLast;\n```\n\n变量的书写必须完全按照这个顺序进行。原因是每个状态变量对应一个存储槽，而 EVM 使用32字节的存储槽（每个存储槽正好是32字节）。当您读取状态变量值时，它会从该变量链接到的存储槽中读取。每个SLOAD调用一次读取 32 个字节，每个SSTORE调用一次写入 32 个字节。由于这些是昂贵的操作，我们真的希望减少存储读取和写入的数量。这就是适当布局状态变量可能会有所帮助的地方。\n\n如果有几个连续的状态变量占用少于 32 个字节怎么办？EMV 打包小于 32 字节的相邻变量。\n\n再看看我们的状态变量：\n\n前两个是 address 变量。address 占用 20 个字节，两个地址占用 40 个字节，这意味着它们必须占用单独的存储槽。它们不能存放在一个插槽中，因为它们根本不适合。\n两个 uint112 变量和一个变量 uint32 ——这看起来很有趣：112+112+32=256！这意味着它们可以放在一个存储槽中！这就是uint112选择保留的原因：保留变量总是一起读取，最好立即从存储中加载它们，而不是单独加载。这节省了一次 SLOAD 操作，而且由于储量被经常使用，这是巨大的气体节省。\n两个uint256变量。这些无法打包，因为它们每个都占用一个完整的插槽。\n同样重要的是，这两个 uint112 变量需要跟在一个占用一个完整插槽的变量之后——这可以确保它们中的第一个不会被打包在前一个插槽中。\n\n## Safe transfer\n\n```\nfunction _safeTransfer(\n  address token,\n  address to,\n  uint256 value\n) private {\n  (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(\n    abi.encodeWithSignature(\"transfer(address,uint256)\", to, value)\n  );\n  if (!success || (data.length != 0 && !abi.decode(data, (bool))))\n    revert TransferFailed();\n}\n```\n\n为什么不在 ERC20 接口上直接调用 transfer 方法？\n\n在 pair 合约中，当进行代币转移时，我们总是想确定它们是否成功。根据 ERC20 的规定，转移方法必须返回一个布尔值：成功时为true；不成功时为fail。大多数代币都正确地实现了这一点，但有些代币却没有，它们只是什么都不返回。当然，我们不能检查代币合约的实现，也不能确定代币的转移确实已经完成，但我们至少可以检查转移的结果。而且，如果转移失败，我们也不想继续。\n\ncall这里是一个地址方法--这是一个低级别的函数，给我们提供了对合约调用的更细粒度的控制。在这个特定的例子中，它允许我们获得一个转移的结果，无论 transfer 方法是否返回一个结果。", "timestamp": 1654307815, "digest": "2jvs0ugFhIyvQrgAi8ARueXlSOS3WLa9mayH7OgF3ts", "contributor": "0xc077cdF746717F3E576E91809e72fD106afF5E52"}

This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nCurrent Stakeholders in the Cannabis Space :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption.

{"id": "1JUZ0q0aD8hZ4CNgHUOwYcIHxiHRBebiKEA7Ad6co7w", "title": "Rethinking What To Sell: Books  as NFT in Web3 (Gumroad Alternatives)", "body": "## Books: Evolution of What to Sell\n\nBefore the Internet, we sell papers. We buy books for its information, true; but we also sell the papers that captures that information we need. When internet became available, books become paperless (at least, for e-books), and we sell only its information. We could have physical guards guarding the shop, preventing people from reading inside the shop without buying. As for e-books, we have lots of locks (expiring PDFs, non-printable contents, format that requires special program to unlock first then read, etc) for gatekeeping its content. Now that information become decentralizes, it’s time to re-think whether we should be selling something else, except for its information. \n\nEven physical books make changes. For example, one get to read books in a book store without buying it. It’s clear that, as long as we don’t damage the book, people are free to read the information and only buy the papers as a collection. Libraries exist to allow people whom can’t afford buying the book, or whom only needs the information (which they can finish reading real quick) for free. Then, internet libraries exist like Archive or OpenLibrary that either store a physical or electronic copies somewhere, bought from a store, and lend it for anyone with an account to borrow. Though with online libraries, to ensure it works like a real libraries, when someone is owning the copy for a period of time, others can’t read. What we want, minimally, is something that all of us could read at once, transparently, but anyone could also buy and support the author as a collection. \n\nLet’s look first at a hybrid solution, solving web2 problem using web3 solution, before moving on to re-think a **web3 problem** with a web3 solution. \n\n## Hybrid Web2-Web3 Book Store\n\nAssuming we want to sell unlockable contents to users. Have you used OpenSea before? If no, try to become an author on NFT and create an NFT; you’d see a field saying “unlockable contents” where its content is accessible only by NFT owners. Ultimately, these contents aren’t store on blockchain; otherwise they would be transparent and viewable on the transaction receipts. NFT acts as a gateway, a key to access information stored on the database, linked via an id (token id). Similarly, you could see this as books sold: only people whom bought the NFT can access the book’s content, perhaps even downloading it. Like Amazon, we might have an open content in the description field of the NFT which contains a link to the sample content stored on some publicly-accessible storage providers (like IPFS). \n\nThough be aware: the reason blockchain is powerful is because of its transparency and immutability. As a hybrid solution to the web2 problem (gatekeeping of its contents), it makes sense to not use blockchain but just the crypto transactions capabilities to replace traditional bank transfers. In any sense, these are like Gumroad or Amazon marketplace. But why crypto transactions? First, author living in certain countries (like mine) cannot accept payment via PayPal and not eligible for direct bank transfer from Gumroad marketplace, so Gumroad is out! Amazon is really dark on its “royalties”, where author only earn 35% of what they sell by default (70% in rare cases), which is just, dark. We want something that anyone could buy and sell anywhere (not just the 200+ countries supported by PayPal or other restrictions) where internet is available (no internet no blockchain sorry); and we want to pay the author more (**at least** 85% goes to the Author). That encourages a hybrid web2-web3 marketplace. \n\nSo, instead of paying via bank transfer (which is annoying), we pay via crypto (one click to a few clicks approving transactions). And we just changed a method of gatekeeping. But we can do more…\n\n## What are we trying to solve here? \n\nUltimately, a book is useful because of its information. From a traditional thinking, if we open up its content, it’s not useful to buy books anymore. Author can’t earn anything for their hard work if everyone could read it for free. But is that really true? Nope. Even in web2 world, there are lots of free information. We already mentioned one -- the library. Another one is pirating books. **A piece of information locked behind gates are doomed to be pirated**. Unless the book’s information is utterly useless; if it’s something interesting, it certainly would get pirated some day later. The author might have earned enough before that, or even keeps earning; but that doesn’t mean people whom can’t afford it or not willing to pay won’t find a way to access the information. If that’s the case, why not open up the content and try selling something else? \n\nLet’s take an example. This article is written on mirror.xyz, and Mirror offers anyone to write a blog post, an essay, or even a novel, and allow anyone online to read the information for free. Then, it could be minted as a paid resources, where people could collect the information and support the author. This provides a good starting point for how we can shape a book store marketplace with the blockchain: transparent content, with unique, limited collectibles. Similarly, if we take a look at other fields like Music: Music NFT now allows anyone to listen to musics, unrestricted to where you’re located (my country cannot listen to Spotify without VPN); and someone could collect the music NFT to support its creator if they really love the music. **Again, free information, paid collectibles.** \n\n> Though, I’m not sure how you write a long novel here if your browser starts lagging trying to cache lots of information in a single page. \n\nIt’s now clear that we want to open up its information, but to sell something else. Let’s see some possibilities of how content creators could earn if they couldn’t earn through information. \n\n## How can Authors Earn? \n\nDon’t expect author to be charity. They also have their burdens that needs money. \n\n### A No No: Sponsorship System. \n\nNope, its not sustainable. There’s a reason why money flows in a closed loop: a large closed loop. A sponsorship system is like publish0x: publish0x tips both the author and the readers. It doesn’t make sense, though. Platform needs to pay both author and readers, but receives nothing in return, and they also need to pay for storage, servers, etc. So, this depends on whether people will donate a large sum of money to keep them running. Whenever donation stops, their platform stops running. Its dependent on rich people to donate a portion of their wealth to the users of the platform. Its non sustainable in the long run, too dependent on a few entities. \n\nMoney derives its value from people’s needs and wants. A sponsorship system is either created by people to attract users to use its platform; or its created by people whom get confused by what blockchain tries to do. Blockchain tries to reward users for some of their actions that we see their **effort** in. They keyword is **effort**. Let’s take a few yes and no. An author writing a blog takes effort. A content creator posting on web3 social media (like [noise.cash](https://noise.cash) or [Myriad Social](https://www.myriad.social)), and reward those that post with coins. But users whom don’t contribute anything except for their time? No, they don’t get rewarded. Instead, they are reading someone else’s information, it makes sense for them to tip the content creators for whatever information they receives that may help them to make money somewhere else; or perhaps that makes them enjoy themselves when they see a funny cat picture. Thinking of rewarding readers for their time is, in my opinion, a deviated view of what blockchain tries to achieve. A user **choose to** (their own choice) read the blog or look through their social media because they wish to relax or learn some information that they don’t know before that. Since they receive something useful (information/emotional enhancement), they pay via token for those whom make their lives better in exchange. They need/want something, so they paid for what they need/what. \n\n> My fellow readers, you don’t have to agree with me to continue reading. :) \n\n### Pre-Sale Benefits\n\nLet’s start with something easy. Those whom own NFTs via pre-sale could read the books 1 month before it’s published to the general audience. Sounds good? Those whom bought the NFT can access a special page where they can watch videos/read books/listen to audiobooks. Or, if these are open (which most probably are, stored on IPFS), we could allow early birds to download the files and watch/read it offline. (Remember, it’s gonna get pirated anyways, so downloading PDF doesn’t need to be encrypted PDF or something). After early access, those people can still buy the NFT after general announcement, for other kinds of benefits. Then, people can read the content (and download the book) for free. ***What, you live on barely 5 dollars per day? It’s okay, forget about the 50+ USD textbooks that are non-affordable, we are free!***\n\n### Additional Benefits\n\nOwners of NFT also owns other benefits, depending on what author provides. For example, taken from learning platform EdX and Pluralsight, you can learn the content for free, but you pay to earn a certificate. Similarly, the certificate could be an NFT, and only owners whom subscribe for an NFT are eligible to take the exam. Or perhaps like language learning platforms, you could learn for free, but access to 1:1 teachings from professionals require payment. Here, owner of NFTs are eligible for 1:1 teachings. Whether or not to have tiers of NFT (like Common, Rare, Legendary) are optional depending on what the author provides. ***As information get unlocked, people earn by paying for others’ time and effort***.\n\n### Extra Time for 1 on 1 (1:1)\n\nMaybe still in a locking sense, people get access to the general book; but to access to author’s experiences on specific problems, whether by asking them 1:1 or author creates another handbook for that, requires an NFT. It’s what you noticed (“experience” or “extra information”) that makes you stand out of the crowd. While people more willingly share basic information, these stuffs that makes you stand out are more closed; and it makes sense for NFT holders to buy these experiences so author are more willing to share their expertise on specific problems. ***Basic information are free, while problem-specific experiences are what makes the differences***.\n\n> Experiences can mean what you deliberately noticed. Read smartcuts Chapter 5 “Waves” for more information.\n>\n> [https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17900734W/Smartcuts_how_hackers_innovators_and_icons_accelerate_success?edition=ia%3Asmartcutshowhack0000snow](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17900734W/Smartcuts_how_hackers_innovators_and_icons_accelerate_success?edition=ia%3Asmartcutshowhack0000snow)\n\n\n### Access to Discussion/Club/DAO\n\nOr perhaps people get access to discussions. For example, some people doesn’t agree with what the book said, and they have their own saying. If the book have a “discussion” tab, NFT holders could commit their ideas. Together, they could update the book (with or without the author) to include stuffs the author missed, not aware of, or perhaps other discussions viewpoints. These could be open or closed, and NFT holders might, together with the author, release a v2 edition of the book after some issues not previously aware of in v1 edition are solved. Then, after v2 edition releases, those holding NFTs can get a split of what’s earned based on their contributions. ***NFT holders are like DAO members, where the DAO is that specific book rather than a general guild/group/community.***\n\n> Though, whether or not this will “inflict some damage” to the author is worth discussing. As in, does the author wants people to make change to their content? Or author have other concerns?\n\nThese are just a few. Who knows if you discover the next innovative solution?\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, as information goes public, as gatekeepers fail to keep information behind gates, it’s time to re-think what we sell. Instead of selling information, one could sell benefits that only book collectors have access to. Ultimately, we aim at provide access to correct, trustworthy information to the general public without worrying about money. We are both a library and a bookseller. People can choose to “borrow” it from the library (read it for free), or they can “buy” a book that they read and goes into their shelf (collect an NFT) (with more benefits than just collecting, perhaps).\n\nSo, it’s time to re-think.\n\n\n---\n\n## Extra: Why a Bookseller on Web3?\n\nYou may have noticed the hints one wrote while reading. First, one tries to sell book on Gumroad, unsuccessfully, because one cannot be paid by PayPal. Then, one tries to sell book on Amazon, and how dark is one’s face when one saw one could only earn 35% out of one’s book! Given the difficulty of being paid, it’s time to move to cryptocurrency.\n\nInitially, web3 comes as a side-product of these motivations. After starting one’s own development, one discovered lots of potential and drawbacks that, either we head butt through them, slicing through all the obstacles that’s on the way to get what we want from the beginning; or we re-think what we want. Honestly, one don’t have the grit to head butt through, nor is one sure that head butt is the right solution; rethinking them seems to fare better, and perhaps provide a brighter future solution.\n\n(this article may be updated in the future).\n\n(pictures taken from Unsplash or Pexels).

{"id": "i7b_lnan3PpWJc6VRCJlzbRPWkB8Bn3Gv0E-ECrZrXs", "title": "Rethinking What To Sell: Books  as NFT in Web3", "body": "## Books: Evolution of What to Sell\n\nBefore the Internet, we sell papers. We buy books for its information, true; but we also sell the papers that captures that information we need. When internet became available, books become paperless (at least, for e-books), and we sell only its information. We could have physical guards guarding the shop, preventing people from reading inside the shop without buying. As for e-books, we have lots of locks (expiring PDFs, non-printable contents, format that requires special program to unlock first then read, etc) for gatekeeping its content. Now that information become decentralizes, it’s time to re-think whether we should be selling something else, except for its information. \n\nEven physical books make changes. For example, one get to read books in a book store without buying it. It’s clear that, as long as we don’t damage the book, people are free to read the information and only buy the papers as a collection. Libraries exist to allow people whom can’t afford buying the book, or whom only needs the information (which they can finish reading real quick) for free. Then, internet libraries exist like Archive or OpenLibrary that either store a physical or electronic copies somewhere, bought from a store, and lend it for anyone with an account to borrow. Though with online libraries, to ensure it works like a real libraries, when someone is owning the copy for a period of time, others can’t read. What we want, minimally, is something that all of us could read at once, transparently, but anyone could also buy and support the author as a collection. \n\nLet’s look first at a hybrid solution, solving web2 problem using web3 solution, before moving on to re-think a **web3 problem** with a web3 solution. \n\n## Hybrid Web2-Web3 Book Store\n\nAssuming we want to sell unlockable contents to users. Have you used OpenSea before? If no, try to become an author on NFT and create an NFT; you’d see a field saying “unlockable contents” where its content is accessible only by NFT owners. Ultimately, these contents aren’t store on blockchain; otherwise they would be transparent and viewable on the transaction receipts. NFT acts as a gateway, a key to access information stored on the database, linked via an id (token id). Similarly, you could see this as books sold: only people whom bought the NFT can access the book’s content, perhaps even downloading it. Like Amazon, we might have an open content in the description field of the NFT which contains a link to the sample content stored on some publicly-accessible storage providers (like IPFS). \n\nThough be aware: the reason blockchain is powerful is because of its transparency and immutability. As a hybrid solution to the web2 problem (gatekeeping of its contents), it makes sense to not use blockchain but just the crypto transactions capabilities to replace traditional bank transfers. In any sense, these are like Gumroad or Amazon marketplace. But why crypto transactions? First, author living in certain countries (like mine) cannot accept payment via PayPal and not eligible for direct bank transfer from Gumroad marketplace, so Gumroad is out! Amazon is really dark on its “royalties”, where author only earn 35% of what they sell by default (70% in rare cases), which is just, dark. We want something that anyone could buy and sell anywhere (not just the 200+ countries supported by PayPal or other restrictions) where internet is available (no internet no blockchain sorry); and we want to pay the author more (**at least** 85% goes to the Author). That encourages a hybrid web2-web3 marketplace. \n\nSo, instead of paying via bank transfer (which is annoying), we pay via crypto (one click to a few clicks approving transactions). And we just changed a method of gatekeeping. But we can do more…\n\n## What are we trying to solve here? \n\nUltimately, a book is useful because of its information.

{"id": "WaZT17BS6RerCigNayslIL3Sxr9t0-vKVg6unPCNETA", "title": "Web3成为年度科技热词", "body": "2021年排名第一的最火爆科技概念，那肯定非元宇宙莫属；那么，排名第二是谁呢？根据目前的热度来看，很可能是Web3。谷歌数据显示，在11月和12月这两个月，“Web3”这个词的全球搜索量大幅上升，热度直逼元宇宙。在路透社刚刚颁布的“2021年度科技热词”中，Web3也和元宇宙、NFT、山寨币等一起上榜。\n\n> 我们知道，互联网先后经历了Web1.0时代和Web2.0时代，可以把这两个时代理解成新浪网和新浪微博的区别——新浪网是1.0，你只能浏览信息，不能发布信息；新浪微博是2.0，在这个平台上，你既可以看，又可以发。那3.0是什么呢？可以理解为，连平台都不需要了，每个人基于区块链技术直接链接，实现互联网的去平台化，颠覆互联网巨头的垄断地位。如今，Web3概念正在被硅谷风投界热捧。\n\n消息就是这样，我们来看看，能学到点啥知识。\n\n需要指出的是，在这一片火热当中，也有人发出质疑。比如马斯克，他虽然是狗狗币的带货一哥，但对Web3却好像不怎么感冒，前两天他发推特说，“有人见过Web3吗？我是没找着。”马斯克认为，Web3目前只是一个被过度包装的营销术语。\n\n还有推特的创始人杰克·多西，他是区块链技术的坚定支持者，前两天也发推特，怒喷Web3被风投机构所控制，原话是：“加密用户并不拥有web3，风投和他们的有限合伙人才是拥有者。Web3不会脱离他们设定的游戏规则。最终，Web3还是一个中心化实体，只不过换了个标签而已。”并且，杰克·多西把矛头直指以安德森-霍洛维茨公司为代表的硅谷顶级风投。\n\n也就是说，抛开技术层面不谈，这场关于Web3的争论，是把硅谷科技大佬和硅谷风投之间的矛盾公开化了。听到这儿，你是不是觉得奇怪，按说，这两者是紧密合作的关系，应该携手入场Web3，怎么掐起来了呢？这里需要补充一个重要的背景：这两年，美国的风投市场发生了很大变化，硅谷的传统风投机构正在面临重大转型。\n\n你知道，硅谷的风投圈原来是一个比较封闭的小圈子，**就像纽约有“华尔街”，硅谷有“沙丘路”，叫得上名号的风投机构基本都在这条路上。**一开始它们都是只投早期创业企业的，不光是为创业企业提供资金，更重要的是孵化工作，也就是作为创业导师，给创业团队传授经验、介绍人脉、寻找职业经理人等等。\n\n> 比如，张潇雨老师曾经在课程里介绍，**硅谷著名企业孵化器YC，每年招收2批创业者，每批从5000个申请项目中挑选100个项目，录取率为2%，比哈佛大学MBA的录取率还低。入选之后，这些项目的创业团队必须搬到硅谷住三个月，每周二晚上聚会，YC会邀请到各路硅谷大佬来给创业者们做讲座或者开放式聊天。在这三个月期间，创业团队还可以随时预约YC的几十名合伙人讨论业务，包括产品细节、营销方案、法律事务等等。**\n\n三个月期满之后，会举行演示日活动，YC会邀请到一批重要投资人到现场，听创业团队挨个介绍公司的创业进展。其中一些团队会当场获得著名风投机构的投资，比如民宿巨头爱彼迎就是在YC演示日，当场拿下红杉资本58万美元的天使轮融资。\n\n你看，硅谷的风投圈很有点“校友会”的熟人小圈子的味道，非常讲究个人关系和人脉。这种方式也非常有效**，据《经济学人》的报道，在美国，每年只有0.5%的新创立公司能够获得风投；而在1995年之后创立的上市公司当中，获得过风投的公司能够占到总市值的76%。可见，传统的孵化手段效率很高。特别是过去三年，风投基金是全球表现最好的资产类别，总体业绩让人眼红。**\n\n这就导致了什么呢？那些传统上不涉足风投的投资机构也闻风而动，比如私募股权基金、对冲基金，甚至是养老基金，也开始直接下场做风投。大块头们入场，导致今年全球风投资金总量暴涨，估计达到了5800亿美元的历史新高，比2020年高出了50%，非常吓人。按管理资金的规模计算，全球十大风投基金中，只有三家是传统风投公司。\n\n新玩家的涌入，很大程度上改变了硅谷风投圈的游戏规则。最明显的改变，就是钱多了，创业公司的估值也水涨船高**。根据《经济学人》的数据，2021年美国创业公司的种子轮估值平均为330万美元，相比10年前，涨了4倍。这对传统风投来说，意味着以低价“捡漏”、获得超额回报的可能性很小了。比如前面提到的YC，在2017年时他们能够以12万美元的投资，获得创业公司7%的股份，现在几乎是不可能了。**\n\n由此带来的另一个变化是，传统风投公司拥有的人脉关系，对创业团队来说也没有那么大的吸引力了。拿谁的钱不是拿，尤其是对于已经相对成熟的创业公司，他们更看重哪个投资人给的估值高，至于他是谁，不重要。\n\n所以，硅谷的传统风投在和“风投新势力”的竞争中，感到很有压力，也琢磨着该怎么转型，大概有这么几种思路。第一，就是进一步向前期寻找机会，比种子轮还靠前，直接投资于互联网上的内容创作者，比如Up主或者网红；第二，就是往后期发展，华尔街杀入了沙丘路，而沙丘路也反攻华尔街。比如红杉资本成立了永续基金，长期持有它投资的创业公司的股份，变得更像一家资产管理公司。\n\n此外，还有第三种思路，就是谁说风投一定是投创业公司，也可以投风险资产，押注加密货币啊。前面提到的安德森-霍洛维茨公司就是其中的代表，它今年推出了一只22亿美元的加密货币基金，专门投资虚拟货币。据估计，**今年风投资金总共向加密货币投入了创纪录的300亿美元，这个数字是2018年的4倍。而前面说的Web3，是硅谷风投在今年着力炒作的概念。**\n\n了解了这个背景，你就能理解，为啥马斯克、杰克·多西这些玩加密币的科技大佬，要把矛头对准Web3了。就像华尔街过来抢传统风投的蛋糕，而传统风投现在过来抢科技大佬的蛋糕，这是矛盾所在。杰克·多西已经说得很直白了，Web3到底是什么，不是重点；重点是，谁能控制它。", "timestamp": 1654308349, "digest": "GY1mregcvhGjbiEE_xr0h5auVuwTJCjxYDuf2q19nU0", "contributor": "0x3ab3865117095D8dddB28A769986ef1ca0c4741A"}

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem**\n\nA successful craft cannabis brand with artisanal integrity struggles to navigate the extractive nature of the traditional corporate company structure. Typically the capital solutions available often compromise the integrity and quality of the products at the expense of the small brands reputation, consumers, and the Earth. \n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\n> *Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space*\n\n**Solution**\n\nMerging Web3 technologies with the cannabis space and creating decentralized and democratized opportunities for companies to raise capital.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over [$200 Billion by 2030](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220203005879/en/Global-Cannabis-Market-Size-Forecast-Report-2021-A-176-Billion-by-2030---Growing-Legalization-of-Medical-Cannabis-in-Various-Countries-Driving-Growth---ResearchAndMarkets.com--) as predicted by Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nCurrent Stakeholders in the Cannabis Space :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption.

We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture.

(Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n**Opportunity**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654308456, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

{"id": "8fBoqDWvlslnp3bGAM1w7Z3_OWtBujugZdafbXsgwPA", "title": "五个方面看Web3基础设施现状", "body": "2014年，Polkadot创始人Gavin Wood创造了“Web 3.0”（以下简写成Web3）这个词条，并在一系列文章中对Web2时代的互联网经济模型予以“控诉”，诸如“互联网就像是个巨婴，还没长大就已经衰老”，“互联网巨头本身或许没有恶意，但同时他们也没有仁慈与原则，他们利用我们的忠诚赚钱，却在自己不方便时切断联系”。 \n \n\n7年前，也许在这些言论时显得过于前卫，但放在2021年的当下就显得极有现实意义，一方面全球各大互联网公司增长乏力，另一方面，在区块链技术加持下，存储、域名、支付、社交通讯、内容平台这些Web2时代的构成要素均能够以去中心化的方式呈现，即便目前来看这些项目仍然极不友好，甚至使用成本还太高。 \n \n\nWeb2正在被初具规模的Web3取代，这是时代大势。 \n \n\n在Web3中，支付工具有Metamask，域名系统有ENS与TNS，存储工作由Filecoin与Arweave完成，内容分发在Mirror等内容平台，去中心化社交工具有Telegram与Discord，可以认为Web3已经初具形态。 \n \n\n以Metamask为代表的支付工具 \n \n\n在去中心化支付领域，应用可分为广义与狭义，狭义应用包括最知名的Metamask、Polkadot{.js}、Ronin Wallet、imToken等专注于支付的工具，广义应用是一切支持链上支付功能的基础设施，包括各类比特币以太坊加密钱包，Layer 2平台与Layer 1公链之间的“桥”，甚至包括中心化平台之间的转账窗口。 \n \n\n这其中最具革命性的当属Metamask这样的应用。MetaMask被誉为世界上最优秀最好用的以太坊开源钱包，能够帮助投资者轻松简便地管理自己的以太坊资产。使用MetaMask无需下载客户端，只需要添加至浏览器扩展程序即可使用。 \n \n\n根据MetaMask母公司ConsenSys今年10月份报告，MetaMask钱包在8月份的活跃用户数量超过了1000万，达到了10,354,279名，相比一年前增加了19倍。截止2021年8月，使用MetaMask最多的前8个国家为菲律宾、美国、越南、英国、中国、印度、俄罗斯和巴西。也就是说，几乎所有加密资产活跃交易者几乎都是MetaMask钱包的用户。 \n \n\n值得注意的是，ConsenSys是由以太坊联合创始人Joseph Lubin创办，被誉为区块链巨头“三大支柱”之一，ConsenSys成立多年来孵化了50多个有助于以太坊生态成长的知名项目，涵盖核心集成组件、服务、开发人员工具、基础设施项目、B2C dapps、企业解决方案、多平台的应用程序等等。同时通过与政府部门、金融机构、互联网巨头等建立亲密的合作关系，将以太坊推向主流世界。另外两大支柱分别是Microsoft Visual Studio与被称为区块链界麦肯锡的咨询业务。 \n \n\n在DeFi与NFT浪潮中，Metamask抢占先机，凭借其出色的功能迅速占领各大浏览器，成为网页支付最方便的工具。 \n \n\n回顾MetaMask发展历程。 \n \n\n2019年是以太坊生态发展取得重大进展的一年，DeFi初具雏形，以太坊网络新增Dapp达到520多个、新增账户数突破2000多万、新增活跃地址40多万。与此同时，NFT、DAO等2021年爆红概念也2019年埋下伏笔，以太坊生态的繁荣促进了MetaMask的发展，根据公开数据，仅在2019年，MetaMask的用户数就突破了130万。 \n \n\n2020年是DeFi开花结果的一年，随着COMP代币一夜暴涨，“交易即挖矿”迅速出圈，属于DeFi的时代正式掀开帷幕，DeFi协议中锁仓金额从2020年初的7亿美元增加到12月的150亿美元，2020年10月份，MetaMask网页版和移动端的月活突破了100万，与2019年的264,000相比，月活同比增长超过了400%。 \n \n\n截止目前，DeFi协议金额高达千亿美金，MetaMask活跃用户数量超过了1000万。 \n \n\n可以说，MetaMask是以太坊生态繁荣最直接的受益者，也是Web2向Web3转型中的助力者，毕竟只需在现有网页上“轻轻一点”就能突破Web2的包围，进入Web3世界。 \n \n\n去中心化存储与域名系统 \n \n\nWeb2时代，海量用户的线上足迹和作品所形成的巨量数据被存储在谷歌、阿里、腾讯等巨头的中心化服务器中，Web2世界创造了一个难以置信的数据王国。 \n \n\nWeb3时代这些数据又该如何保存？如何保证这数据王国所依赖的是一个可靠稳定安全的数据存储网络？而元宇宙世界被货币化的虚拟物品如果持续保存在中心化服务器中，元数据必将面临失效或被篡改的危险，一旦类似事件发生，元宇宙将失去其存在的必要与价值。 \n \n\n因此，基于IPFS的Filecoin、Arweave与Storj等去中心化存储项目成为必要。IPFS开创性地引入了激励层Filecoin以确保数据在约定期限内的可靠存储，而Arweave通过技术创新以期实现数据在链上的永久保存，做到了“像保存云文档一样保存数据”，Storj则是一个去中心化的基于区块链的分布式云存储系统，它能保证任何时候对用户上传到区块链的内容进行加密。 \n \n\n以基于IPFS的Filecoin为例。 \n \n\n首先来看IFPS，该项目是2015年提出的中心化存储方案，Filecoin则是IPFS的激励层，通过通证激励机制以确保文件在约定期限内的可靠存储。Filecoin允许任何个体利用空闲的硬盘空间和带宽在公开市场上提供数据存储和检索服务，将未用硬盘容量货币化，并通过PoRep（复制证明）和 Post（时空证明）来保证矿工真实存储文件的情况，用户通过发布订单寻找合适的存储矿工，数据加密并分割后发送至矿工，矿工将该信息添加至存储区块进行存储并持续证明其工作以获得奖励。以上是其工作原理。 \n \n\n想象一下，你在OpenSea购买的价值40万美金的CryptoPunks，如果是存储在任何一个中心化服务器中，你会安心吗？ \n \n\n显然，去中心化存储的发展是Web3时代到来之前必不可少的基础设施。 \n \n\n关于域名。 \n \n\n众所周知，域名是互联网上的私有主页，是个人与企业完全控制的“在线房地产”，域名可以是虚构的，也可以是透明的描述，可用于从个人博客到跨国公司的公共网站的所有内容。域名可以很小，是个人作品的汇总集合，也可以是每天访问量数以百万计的购物网站与社交媒体。 \n \n\n不过，在Web2时代，一切都运行在中心化网络之上，即便对某域名存在所有权，该域名依然被保存在中心化服务器上，易受人为控制。 \n \n\nENS与TNS这类去中心化域名系统的出现，将改变这一现状。 \n \n\nENS，是Ethereum Name Service的缩写，中文名字叫“以太坊域名服务”，是一个基于以太坊区块链的可扩展，分布式和开放式命名系统，主要服务于人类可读的映射名称。ENS将人类可读的名称，比如tb.eth映射到机器可读的标识符，具有读取以太坊地址，内容哈希和元数据的功能的功能。TNS是Terra Name Service的缩写，是一个基于Terra区块链的可扩展、分布式和开放式命名系统，功能上与ENS类似。 \n \n\n那么，中心化域名与去中心化域名有哪些区别？ \n \n\n以ENS为例，在一定程度上，ENS与DNS的定位非常相似，作用几乎相同，只不过DNS是把域名解析为IP地址，而ENS是把.eth域名解析为以太坊地址。与DNS不同的是，ENS更加去中心化，ENS主要包括两个组件：注册表和解析器。ENS的注册表是一个智能合约，该合约维护所有域名和子域名列表；而解析器则负责将域名转换为地址。当下ENS仅仅支持数字货币地址的解析，难以连接传统的信息互联网和区块链底层。 \n \n\n此外，ENS是把.eth域名解析为以太坊地址，链上转账，只需要一个.eth域名即可，以太坊地址将被大幅简化。 \n \n\n简而言之，去中心化域名服务系统是建立在以太坊与Terra这样的去中心化区块链底层协议上的，域名所有权绝对化，还能极大降低收款地址的复杂性，为Web3的到来奠定基础。 \n \n\n内容平台与去中心化社交工具 \n \n\n我们在描述互联网对这个世界影响时，“互联网把全世界烫平了”这段话恐怕是最为贴切的表述，互联网让全世界变成地球村，人们可以无限获取和向任何人即时发送免费信息，不过这也带来了新的问题——原创内容变得廉价，在复制黏贴根本不需要付出任何代价的时候，版权就难以得到保证，于是快餐式文化成为主流。 \n \n\n不过，区块链的到来让稀缺与价值回归，版权有希望以“哈希”“秘钥”的形式存在，内容也能够被保存在Filecoin、Arweave与Storj等开源的去中心化存储项目中。 \n \n\n以近期上线的内容平台Mirror为例，该项目自一开始就集成了加密原生货币，并通过绑定数字身份让创作者拥有更多控制和所有权。这些特性让Mirror自诞生起就拥有很多互联网应用所缺乏的数字原生信息载体的多重属性，包括可编程性、互操作性、可组合性、病毒传播性和可转移性，进而实现其价值交换的可能。 \n \n\n就内容交互形式而言，Mirror算得上是Web3的原生应用。 \n \n\n例如在内容存储方面，Mirror使用了去中心化数据存储协议Arweave存储数据，实现了永久存储，包括创作者发布的内容及其所有相关更改、验证作者身份真实性所需的所有信息。在数据存储费用方面，就笔者体验来看，目前用户可以以几乎免费的方式（实际上需要支付价值不到0.001美元的AR代币，可以忽略不计）上传文字、图片信息，一旦上传就会被永久保存在Arweave中。 \n \n\n此外，Mirror还集成了去中心化域名服务ENS实现创作者确权，每一个作者博客域名都可以绑定自己的ENS域名，并生成一个由ENS域名打头的mirror.xyz子域名作为自己内容发布平台主页。 \n \n\n内容发布后由用户使用密钥签名确认，因此Mirror上发布的每一篇内容都有著作权声明，以证明某个条目的所有权。此外，创作的内容还会引发评论，即用户生成的内容。 \n \n\n相信未来还会有更多类似Mirror的原生Web3内容发布平台。 \n \n\n关于去中心化社交工具。 \n \n\n虽然Telegram具备去中心化社交应用的大部分属性，例如Telegram采用端对端加密，所有内容不会通过其服务器，它的私密聊天功能可以在用户退出登录时自动删除聊天记录。这些特点使得Telegram摇身一变成为币圈最受欢迎的通讯工具之一。 \n \n\n但是，2019年10月，SEC责令Telegram停止销售其加密货币(名为Gram)，意味着Telegram失去了Web3“去中心化自治”的关键属性，不能称之为原生的Web3应用。 \n \n\n站在当下，可以认为Web3已初具形态，相信随着区块链技术的发展，Web3帝国的所有版图都将被补上。 \n \n\n就像Gavin Wood在《我们为什么需要Web 3.0》中所描述的那样，随着技术的成熟，传统企业不可避免地会放慢创新速度，将产品视为摇钱树（例如微软），Web3.0的优势将不断增强，与城市和国家禁止优步、Airbnb、Grindr和维基百科一样，Web3.0不可能遭到禁止。  \n  ", "timestamp": 1654309420, "digest":

Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nCurrent Stakeholders in the Cannabis Space :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption.

来写，并不是 Solidity并不能直接与前端界面进行数据交互。\n\n第1章: 介绍 Web3.js \n 完成第五课以后，我们的僵尸 DApp 的 Solidity 合约部分就完成了。现在我们来做一个基本的网页好让你的用户能玩它。 要做到这一点，我们将使用以太坊基金发布的 JavaScript 库 —— Web3.js.\n\n什么是 Web3.js? \n 还记得么？以太坊网络是由节点组成的，每一个节点都包含了区块链的一份拷贝。当你想要调用一份智能合约的一个方法，你需要从其中一个节点中查找并告诉它:\n\n智能合约的地址 \n 你想调用的方法，以及 \n 你想传入那个方法的参数 \n 以太坊节点只能识别一种叫做 JSON-RPC 的语言。这种语言直接读起来并不好懂。当你你想调用一个合约的方法的时候，需要发送的查询语句将会是这样的：\n\n```\n{\n    \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\n    \"method\":\"eth_sendTransaction\",\n    \"params\":[\n        {\n            \"from\":\"0xb60e8dd61c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07233155\",\n            \"to\":\"0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567\",\n            \"gas\":\"0x76c0\",\n            \"gasPrice\":\"0x9184e72a000\",\n            \"value\":\"0x9184e72a\",\n            \"data\":\"0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8d46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f072445675058bb8eb970870f072445675\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"id\":1\n}\n```\n\n幸运的是 Web3.js 把这些令人讨厌的查询语句都隐藏起来了， 所以你只需要与方便易懂的 JavaScript 界面进行交互即可。\n\n你不需要构建上面的查询语句，在你的代码中调用一个函数看起来将是这样：\n\n```\nCryptoZombies.methods.createRandomZombie(\"Vitalik Nakamoto ?\")\n  .send({ from: \"0xb60e8dd61c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07233155\", gas: \"3000000\" })\n```\n\n我们将在接下来的几章详细解释这些语句，不过首先我们来把 Web3.js 环境搭建起来。\n\n准备好了么？ \n 取决于你的项目工作流程和你的爱好，你可以用一些常用工具把 Web3.js 添加进来：\n\n```\n// 用 NPM\nnpm install web3\n// 用 Yarn\nyarn add web3\n// 用 Bower\nbower install web3\n// ...或者其他。\n```\n\n甚至，你可以从 github 直接下载压缩后的 .js 文件 然后包含到你的项目文件中：\n\n```\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"web3.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n因为我们不想让你花太多在项目环境搭建上，在本教程中我们将使用上面的 script 标签来将 Web3.js 引入。\n\n实战演习 \n 我们为你建立了一个HTML 项目空壳 —— index.html。假设在和 index.html 同个文件夹里有一份 web3.min.js\n\n使用上面的 script 标签代码把 web3.js 添加进去以备接下来使用。\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>CryptoZombies front-end</title>\n    <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n    <!-- Include web3.js here -->\n     <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"web3.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n第2章: Web3 提供者 \n 太棒了。现在我们的项目中有了Web3.js, 来初始化它然后和区块链对话吧。\n\n首先我们需要 Web3 Provider .\n\n要记住，以太坊是由共享同一份数据的相同拷贝的 节点 构成的。 在 Web3.js 里设置 Web3 的 Provider（提供者） 告诉我们的代码应该和 哪个节点 交互来处理我们的读写。这就好像在传统的 Web 应用程序中为你的 API 调用设置远程 Web 服务器的网址。\n\n你可以运行你自己的以太坊节点来作为 Provider。 不过，有一个第三方的服务，可以让你的生活变得轻松点，让你不必为了给你的用户提供DApp而维护一个以太坊节点— Infura .\n\nInfura \n Infura 是一个服务，它维护了很多以太坊节点并提供了一个缓存层来实现高速读取。你可以用他们的 API 来免费访问这个服务。 用 Infura 作为节点提供者，你可以不用自己运营节点就能很可靠地向以太坊发送、接收信息。\n\n你可以通过这样把 Infura 作为你的 Web3 节点提供者：\n\n```\nvar web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider(\"wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws\"));\n```\n\n不过，因为我们的 DApp 将被很多人使用，这些用户不单会从区块链读取信息，还会向区块链 写 入信息，我们需要用一个方法让用户可以用他们的私钥给事务签名。\n\n注意: 以太坊 (以及通常意义上的 blockchains )使用一个公钥/私钥对来对给事务做数字签名。把它想成一个数字签名的异常安全的密码。这样当我修改区块链上的数据的时候，我可以用我的公钥来 证明 我就是签名的那个。但是因为没人知道我的私钥，所以没人能伪造我的事务。\n\n加密学非常复杂，所以除非你是个专家并且的确知道自己在做什么，你最好不要在你应用的前端中管理你用户的私钥。\n\n不过幸运的是，你并不需要，已经有可以帮你处理这件事的服务了： Metamask .\n\nMetamask \n Metamask 是 Chrome 和 Firefox 的浏览器扩展， 它能让用户安全地维护他们的以太坊账户和私钥， 并用他们的账户和使用 Web3.js 的网站互动（如果你还没用过它，你肯定会想去安装的——这样你的浏览器就能使用 Web3.js 了，然后你就可以和任何与以太坊区块链通信的网站交互了）\n\n作为开发者，如果你想让用户从他们的浏览器里通过网站和你的DApp交互（就像我们在 CryptoZombies 游戏里一样），你肯定会想要兼容 Metamask 的。\n\n注意: Metamask 默认使用 Infura 的服务器做为 web3 提供者。 就像我们上面做的那样。不过它还为用户提供了选择他们自己 Web3 提供者的选项。所以使用 Metamask 的 web3 提供者，你就给了用户选择权，而自己无需操心这一块。\n\n使用 Metamask 的 web3 提供者 \n Metamask 把它的 web3 提供者注入到浏览器的全局 JavaScript对象 web3中。所以你的应用可以检查 web3 是否存在。若存在就使用 web3.currentProvider 作为它的提供者。\n\n这里是一些 Metamask 提供的示例代码，用来检查用户是否安装了MetaMask，如果没有安装就告诉用户需要安装MetaMask来使用我们的应用。\n\n```\nwindow.addEventListener('load', function() {\n\n  // 检查web3是否已经注入到(Mist/MetaMask)\n  if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {\n    // 使用 Mist/MetaMask 的提供者\n    web3js = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);\n  } else {\n    // 处理用户没安装的情况， 比如显示一个消息\n    // 告诉他们要安装 MetaMask 来使用我们的应用\n  }\n\n  // 现在你可以启动你的应用并自由访问 Web3.js:\n  startApp()\n\n})\n```\n\n你可以在你所有的应用中使用这段样板代码，好检查用户是否安装以及告诉用户安装 MetaMask。\n\n注意: 除了MetaMask，你的用户也可能在使用其他他的私钥管理应用，比如 Mist 浏览器。不过，它们都实现了相同的模式来注入 web3 变量。所以我这里描述的方法对两者是通用的。\n\n实战演习 \n 我们在HTML文件中的 </body> 标签前面放置了一个空的 script 标签。可以把这节课的 JavaScript 代码写在里面。\n\n把上面用来检测 MetaMask 是否安装的模板代码粘贴进来。请粘贴到以 window.addEventListener 开头的代码块中。\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>CryptoZombies front-end</title>\n    <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n    <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"web3.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n\n    <script>\n      // Start here\n      window.addEventListener('load', function() {\n\n      // 检查web3是否已经注入到(Mist/MetaMask)\n      if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {\n        // 使用 Mist/MetaMask 的提供者\n        web3js = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);\n      } else {\n        // 处理用户没安装的情况， 比如显示一个消息\n        // 告诉他们要安装 MetaMask 来使用我们的应用\n      }\n\n      // 现在你可以启动你的应用并自由访问 Web3.js:\n      startApp()\n\n    })\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n第3章: 和合约对话 \n 现在，我们已经用 MetaMask 的 Web3 提供者初始化了 Web3.js。接下来就让它和我们的智能合约对话吧。\n\nWeb3.js 需要两个东西来和你的合约对话: 它的 地址 和它的 ABI。\n\n合约地址 \n 在你写完了你的智能合约后，你需要编译它并把它部署到以太坊。我们将在下一课中详述部署，因为它和写代码是截然不同的过程，所以我们决定打乱顺序，先来讲 Web3.js。\n\n在你部署智能合约以后，它将获得一个以太坊上的永久地址。如果你还记得第二课，CryptoKitties 在以太坊上的地址是 0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d。\n\n你需要在部署后复制这个地址以来和你的智能合约对话。\n\n合约 ABI \n 另一个 Web3.js 为了要和你的智能合约对话而需要的东西是 ABI。\n\nABI 意为应用二进制接口（Application Binary Interface）。 基本上，它是以 JSON 格式表示合约的方法，告诉 Web3.js 如何以合同理解的方式格式化函数调用。\n\n当你编译你的合约向以太坊部署时(我们将在第七课详述)， Solidity 编译器会给你 ABI，所以除了合约地址，你还需要把这个也复制下来。\n\n因为我们这一课不会讲述部署，所以现在我们已经帮你编译了 ABI 并放在了名为cryptozombies_abi.js，文件中，保存在一个名为 cryptoZombiesABI 的变量中。\n\n如果我们将cryptozombies_abi.js 包含进我们的项目，我们就能通过那个变量访问 CryptoZombies ABI 。\n\n实例化 Web3.js \n 一旦你有了合约的地址和 ABI，你可以像这样来实例化 Web3.js。\n\n```\n// 实例化 myContract\nvar myContract = new web3js.eth.Contract(myABI, myContractAddress);\n```\n\n实战演习 \n 在文件的 <head> 标签块中，用 script 标签引入cryptozombies_abi.js，好把 ABI 的定义引入项目。\n\n在 <body> 里的 <script> 开头 , 定义一个var，取名 cryptoZombies， 不过不要对其赋值，稍后我们将用这个这个变量来存储我们实例化合约。\n\n接下来，创建一个名为 startApp() 的 function。 接下来两步来完成这个方法。\n\nstartApp() 里应该做的第一件事是定义一个名为cryptoZombiesAddress 的变量并赋值为\"你的合约地址\" (这是你的合约在以太坊主网上的地址)。\n\n最后，来实例化我们的合约。模仿我们上面的代码，将 cryptoZombies 赋值为 new web3js.eth.Contract (使用我们上面代码中通过 script 引入的 cryptoZombiesABI 和 cryptoZombiesAddress)。\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n

(如果你对 JavaScript的 Promises 不了解，最好先去学习一下这方面知识再继续)。\n\n一旦那个 promise 被 resolve, (意味着我们从 Web3 提供者那里获得了响应)，我们的例子代码将执行 then 语句中的代码，在控制台打出 result。\n\nresult 是一个像这样的 JavaScript 对象：\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"H4XF13LD MORRIS'S COOLER OLDER BROTHER\",\n  \"dna\": \"1337133713371337\",\n  \"level\": \"9999\",\n  \"readyTime\": \"1522498671\",\n  \"winCount\": \"999999999\",\n  \"lossCount\": \"0\" // Obviously.\n}\n```\n\n我们可以用一些前端逻辑代码来解析这个对象并在前端界面友好展示。\n\n实战演习 \n 我们已经帮你把 getZombieDetails 复制进了代码。\n\n先为zombieToOwner 创建一个类似的函数。如果你还记得 ZombieFactory.sol，我们有一个长这样的映射：\n\n```\nmapping (uint => address) public zombieToOwner;\n```\n\n定义一个 JavaScript 方法，起名为 zombieToOwner。和上面的 getZombieDetails 类似， 它将接收一个id 作为参数，并返回一个 Web3.js call 我们合约里的zombieToOwner 。\n\n之后在下面，为 getZombiesByOwner 定义一个方法。如果你还能记起 ZombieHelper.sol，这个方法定义像这样：\n\n```\nfunction getZombiesByOwner(address _owner)\n```\n\n我们的 getZombiesByOwner 方法将接收 owner 作为参数，并返回一个对我们函数 getZombiesByOwner的 Web3.js call\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>CryptoZombies front-end</title>\n    <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n    <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"web3.min.js\"></script>\n    <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"cryptozombies_abi.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n\n    <script>\n      var cryptoZombies;\n\n      function startApp() {\n        var cryptoZombiesAddress = \"YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS\";\n        cryptoZombies = new web3js.eth.Contract(cryptoZombiesABI, cryptoZombiesAddress);\n      }\n\n   \n\n      // 1.

这样的前端框架来让你的前端开发变得轻松一些。不过要教授 React 或者 Vue.js 知识的话，就大大超出了本教程的范畴——它们本身就需要几节课甚至一整个教程来教学。\n\n所以为了让 CryptoZombies.io 专注于以太坊和智能合约，我们将使用 JQuery 来做一个快速示例，展示如何解析和展示从智能合约中拿到的数据。\n\n显示僵尸数据 — 一个粗略的例子 \n 我们已经在代码中添加了一个空的代码块 <div id=\"zombies\"></div>， 在 displayZombies 方法中也同样有一个。\n\n回忆一下在之前章节中我们在 startApp() 方法内部调用了 displayZombies 并传入了 call getZombiesByOwner 获得的结果，它将被传入一个僵尸ID数组，像这样： \n \\[0, 13, 47\\]\n\n因为我们想让我们的 displayZombies 方法做这些事:\n\n首先清除 #zombies 的内容以防里面已经有什么内容（这样当用户切换账号的时候，之前账号的僵尸大军数据就会被清除）\n\n循环遍历 id，对每一个id调用 getZombieDetails(id)， 从我们的合约中获得这个僵尸的数据。\n\n将获得的僵尸数据放进一个HTML模板中以格式化显示，追加进 #zombies 里面。\n\n再次声明，我们只用了 JQuery，没有任何模板引擎，所以会非常丑。不过这只是一个如何展示僵尸数据的示例而已。\n\n```\n// 在合约中查找僵尸数据，返回一个对象\ngetZombieDetails(id)\n.then(function(zombie) {\n  // 用 ES6 的模板语法来向HTML中注入变量\n  // 把每一个都追加进 #zombies div\n  $(\"#zombies\").append(`<div class=\"zombie\">\n    <ul>\n      <li>Name: ${zombie.name}</li>\n      <li>DNA: ${zombie.dna}</li>\n      <li>Level: ${zombie.level}</li>\n      <li>Wins: ${zombie.winCount}</li>\n      <li>Losses: ${zombie.lossCount}</li>\n      <li>Ready Time: ${zombie.readyTime}</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>`);\n});\n```\n\n如何来展示僵尸元素呢？ \n 在上面的例子中，我们只是简单地用字符串来显示 DNA。不过在你的 DApp 中，你将需要把 DNA 转换成图片来显示你的僵尸。\n\n我们通过把 DNA 字符串分割成小的字符串来做到这一点，每2位数字代表一个图片，类似这样：\n\n```\n// 得到一个 1-7 的数字来表示僵尸的头:\nvar head = parseInt(zombie.dna.substring(0, 2)) % 7 + 1\n\n// 我们有7张头部图片：\nvar headSrc = \"../assets/zombieparts/head-\" + i + \".png\"\n```\n\n每一个模块都用 CSS 绝对定位来显示，在一个上面叠加另外一个。\n\n如果你想看我们的具体实现，我们将用来展示僵尸形象的 Vue.js 模块开源了： 点击这里.\n\n不过，因为那个文件中有太多行代码， 超出了本教程的讨论范围。我们依然还是使用上面超级简单的 JQuery 实现，把美化僵尸的工作作为家庭作业留给你了?\n\n实战演习 \n 我们为你创建了一个空的 displayZombies 方法。来一起实现它。\n\n首先我们需要清空 #zombies 的内容。 用JQuery，你可以这样做： $(\"#zombies\").empty();。\n\n接下来，我们要循环遍历所有的 id，循环这样用： for (id of ids) {\n\n在循环内部，复制粘贴上面的代码，对每一个id调用 getZombieDetails(id)，然后用 $(\"#zombies\").append(...) 把内容追加进我们的 HTML 里面。\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n

     if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {\n          // Use Mist/MetaMask's provider\n          web3js = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);\n        } else {\n          // Handle the case where the user doesn't have Metamask installed\n          // Probably show them a message prompting them to install Metamask\n        }\n\n        // Now you can start your app & access web3 freely:\n        startApp()\n\n      })\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n第7章: 发送事务 \n 这下我们的界面能检测用户的 MetaMask 账户，并自动在首页显示它们的僵尸大军了，有没有很棒？\n\n现在我们来看看用 send 函数来修改我们智能合约里面的数据。\n\n相对 call 函数， send 函数有如下主要区别:\n\nsend 一个事务需要一个 from 地址来表明谁在调用这个函数（也就是你 Solidity 代码里的 msg.sender )。 我们需要这是我们 DApp 的用户，这样一来 MetaMask 才会弹出提示让他们对事务签名。\n\nsend 一个事务将花费 gas\n\n在用户 send 一个事务到该事务对区块链产生实际影响之间有一个不可忽略的延迟。这是因为我们必须等待事务被包含进一个区块里，以太坊上一个区块的时间平均下来是15秒左右。如果当前在以太坊上有大量挂起事务或者用户发送了过低的 gas 价格，我们的事务可能需要等待数个区块才能被包含进去，往往可能花费数分钟。\n\n所以在我们的代码中我们需要编写逻辑来处理这部分异步特性。\n\n生成一个僵尸 \n 我们来看一个合约中一个新用户将要调用的第一个函数: createRandomZombie.\n\n作为复习，这里是合约中的 Solidity 代码：\n\n```\nfunction createRandomZombie(string _name) public {\n  require(ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] == 0);\n  uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);\n  randDna = randDna - randDna % 100;\n  _createZombie(_name, randDna);\n}\n```\n\n这是如何在用 MetaMask 在 Web3.js 中调用这个函数的示例:\n\n```\nfunction createRandomZombie(name) {\n  // 这将需要一段时间，所以在界面中告诉用户这一点\n  // 事务被发送出去了\n  $(\"#txStatus\").text(\"正在区块链上创建僵尸，这将需要一会儿...\");\n  // 把事务发送到我们的合约:\n  return cryptoZombies.methods.createRandomZombie(name)\n  .send({ from: userAccount })\n  .on(\"receipt\", function(receipt) {\n    $(\"#txStatus\").text(\"成功生成了 \" + name + \"!\");\n    // 事务被区块链接受了，重新渲染界面\n    getZombiesByOwner(userAccount).then(displayZombies);\n  })\n  .on(\"error\", function(error) {\n    // 告诉用户合约失败了\n    $(\"#txStatus\").text(error);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n我们的函数 send 一个事务到我们的 Web3 提供者，然后链式添加一些事件监听:\n\nreceipt 将在合约被包含进以太坊区块上以后被触发，这意味着僵尸被创建并保存进我们的合约了。 \n error 将在事务未被成功包含进区块后触发，比如用户未支付足够的 gas。我们需要在界面中通知用户事务失败以便他们可以再次尝试。 \n 注意:你可以在调用 send 时选择指定 gas 和 gasPrice， 例如： .send({ from: userAccount, gas: 3000000 })。如果你不指定，MetaMask 将让用户自己选择数值。\n\n实战演习 \n 我们添加了一个 div， 指定 ID 为 txStatus — 这样我们可以通过更新这个 div 来通知用户事务的状态。\n\n在 displayZombies下面， 复制粘贴上面 createRandomZombie 的代码。\n\n我们来实现另外一个函数 feedOnKitty：\n\n调用 feedOnKitty 的逻辑几乎一样 — 我们将发送一个事务来调用这个函数，并且成功的事务会为我们创建一个僵尸，所以我们希望在成功后重新绘制界面。\n\n在 createRandomZombie 下面复制粘贴它的代码，改动这些地方:\n\na) 给其命名为 feedOnKitty， 它将接收两个参数 zombieId 和 kittyId\n\nb) #txStatus 的文本内容将更新为: \"正在吃猫咪，这将需要一会儿...\"\n\nc) 让其调用我们合约里面的 feedOnKitty 函数并传入相同的参数\n\nd) #txStatus 里面的的成功信息应该是 \"吃了一只猫咪并生成了一只新僵尸！\"\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n

\n 一个 wei 是以太的最小单位 — 1 ether 等于 10^18 wei\n\n太多0要数了，不过幸运的是 Web3.js 有一个转换工具来帮我们做这件事：\n\n```\n// 把 1 ETH 转换成 Wei\nweb3js.utils.toWei(\"1\", \"ether\");\n```\n\n在我们的 DApp 里， 我们设置了 levelUpFee = 0.001 ether，所以调用 levelUp 方法的时候，我们可以让用户用以下的代码同时发送 0.001 以太:\n\n```\ncryptoZombies.methods.levelUp(zombieId)\n.send({ from: userAccount, value: web3js.utils.toWei(\"0.001\",\"ether\") })\n```\n\n实战演习 \n 在 feedOnKitty 下面添加一个 levelUp 方法。代码和 feedOnKitty 将非常相似。不过：\n\n函数将接收一个参数, zombieId\n\n在发送事务之前，txStatus 的文本应该是 \"正在升级您的僵尸...\"\n\n当它调用合约里的levelUp时，它应该发送\"0.001\" ETH，并用 toWei 转换，如同上面例子里那样。\n\n成功之后应该显示 \"不得了了！僵尸成功升级啦！\"\n\n我们 不 需要在调用 getZombiesByOwner 后重新绘制界面 — 因为在这里我们只是修改了僵尸的级别而已。\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>CryptoZombies front-end</title>\n    <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n    <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"web3.min.js\"></script>\n    <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"cryptozombies_abi.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"txStatus\"></div>\n    <div id=\"zombies\"></div>\n\n    <script>\n      var cryptoZombies;\n      var userAccount;\n\n      function startApp() {\n        var cryptoZombiesAddress = \"YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS\";\n        cryptoZombies = new web3js.eth.Contract(cryptoZombiesABI, cryptoZombiesAddress);\n\n        var accountInterval = setInterval(function() {\n          // Check if account has changed\n          if (web3.eth.accounts[0] !== userAccount) {\n            userAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0];\n            // Call a function to update the UI with the new account\n            getZombiesByOwner(userAccount)\n            .then(displayZombies);\n          }\n        }, 100);\n      }\n\n      function displayZombies(ids) {\n        $(\"#zombies\").empty();\n        for (id of ids) {\n          // Look up zombie details from our contract.

来更新界面\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>CryptoZombies front-end</title>\n    <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n    <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"web3.min.js\"></script>\n    <script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"cryptozombies_abi.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"txStatus\"></div>\n    <div id=\"zombies\"></div>\n\n    <script>\n      var cryptoZombies;\n      var userAccount;\n\n      function startApp() {\n        var cryptoZombiesAddress = \"YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS\";\n        cryptoZombies = new web3js.eth.Contract(cryptoZombiesABI, cryptoZombiesAddress);\n\n        var accountInterval = setInterval(function() {\n          // Check if account has changed\n          if (web3.eth.accounts[0] !== userAccount) {\n            userAccount = web3.eth.accounts[0];\n            // Call a function to update the UI with the new account\n            getZombiesByOwner(userAccount)\n            .then(displayZombies);\n          }\n        }, 100);\n\n        // Start here\n        var web3Infura = new Web3(new Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider(\"wss:\n        var czEvents = new web3Infura.eth.Contract(cryptoZombiesABI, cryptoZombiesAddress);\n        \n        czEvents.events.Transfer({ filter: { _to: userAccount } })\n        .on(\"data\", function(event) {\n          let data = event.returnValues;\n          getZombiesByOwner(userAccount).then(displayZombies);\n        }).on('error', console.error);\n      }\n\n      function displayZombies(ids) {\n        $(\"#zombies\").empty();\n        for (id of ids) {\n          // Look up zombie details from our contract.

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem**\n\nA successful craft cannabis brand with artisanal integrity struggles to navigate the extractive nature of the traditional corporate company structure. Typically the capital solutions available often compromise the integrity and quality of the products at the expense of the small brands reputation, consumers, and the Earth. \n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\n> *Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space*\n\n**Solution**\n\nMerging Web3 technologies with the cannabis space and creating decentralized and democratized opportunities for companies to raise capital.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) to grow and global cannabis markets continue to come online. The cannabis space is estimated to grow to over [$200 Billion by 2030](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220203005879/en/Global-Cannabis-Market-Size-Forecast-Report-2021-A-176-Billion-by-2030---Growing-Legalization-of-Medical-Cannabis-in-Various-Countries-Driving-Growth---ResearchAndMarkets.com--) as predicted by Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nCurrent Stakeholders in the Cannabis Space :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption.

(Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n**Opportunity**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654309048, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

We buy books for its information, true; but we also sell the papers that captures that information we need. When internet became available, books become paperless (at least, for e-books), and we sell only its information. We could have physical guards guarding the shop, preventing people from reading inside the shop without buying. As for e-books, we have lots of locks (expiring PDFs, non-printable contents, format that requires special program to unlock first then read, etc) for gatekeeping its content. Now that information become decentralizes, it’s time to re-think whether we should be selling something else, except for its information. \n\nEven physical books make changes. For example, one get to read books in a book store without buying it. It’s clear that, as long as we don’t damage the book, people are free to read the information and only buy the papers as a collection. Libraries exist to allow people whom can’t afford buying the book, or whom only needs the information (which they can finish reading real quick) for free. Then, internet libraries exist like Archive or OpenLibrary that either store a physical or electronic copies somewhere, bought from a store, and lend it for anyone with an account to borrow. Though with online libraries, to ensure it works like a real libraries, when someone is owning the copy for a period of time, others can’t read. What we want, minimally, is something that all of us could read at once, transparently, but anyone could also buy and support the author as a collection. \n\nLet’s look first at a hybrid solution, solving web2 problem using web3 solution, before moving on to re-think a **web3 problem** with a web3 solution. \n\n## Hybrid Web2-Web3 Book Store\n\nAssuming we want to sell unlockable contents to users. Have you used OpenSea before? If no, try to become an author on NFT and create an NFT; you’d see a field saying “unlockable contents” where its content is accessible only by NFT owners. Ultimately, these contents aren’t store on blockchain; otherwise they would be transparent and viewable on the transaction receipts. NFT acts as a gateway, a key to access information stored on the database, linked via an id (token id). Similarly, you could see this as books sold: only people whom bought the NFT can access the book’s content, perhaps even downloading it. Like Amazon, we might have an open content in the description field of the NFT which contains a link to the sample content stored on some publicly-accessible storage providers (like IPFS). \n\nThough be aware: the reason blockchain is powerful is because of its transparency and immutability. As a hybrid solution to the web2 problem (gatekeeping of its contents), it makes sense to not use blockchain but just the crypto transactions capabilities to replace traditional bank transfers. In any sense, these are like Gumroad or Amazon marketplace. But why crypto transactions? First, author living in certain countries (like mine) cannot accept payment via PayPal and not eligible for direct bank transfer from Gumroad marketplace, so Gumroad is out! Amazon is really dark on its “royalties”, where author only earn 35% of what they sell by default (70% in rare cases), which is just, dark. We want something that anyone could buy and sell anywhere (not just the 200+ countries supported by PayPal or other restrictions) where internet is available (no internet no blockchain sorry); and we want to pay the author more (**at least** 85% goes to the Author). That encourages a hybrid web2-web3 marketplace. \n\nSo, instead of paying via bank transfer (which is annoying), we pay via crypto (one click to a few clicks approving transactions). And we just changed a method of gatekeeping. But we can do more…\n\n## What are we trying to solve here? \n\nUltimately, a book is useful because of its information. From a traditional thinking, if we open up its content, it’s not useful to buy books anymore. Author can’t earn anything for their hard work if everyone could read it for free. But is that really true? Nope. Even in web2 world, there are lots of free information. We already mentioned one -- the library. Another one is pirating books. **A piece of information locked behind gates are doomed to be pirated**. Unless the book’s information is utterly useless; if it’s something interesting, it certainly would get pirated some day later. The author might have earned enough before that, or even keeps earning; but that doesn’t mean people whom can’t afford it or not willing to pay won’t find a way to access the information. If that’s the case, why not open up the content and try selling something else? \n\nLet’s take an example. This article is written on mirror.xyz, and Mirror offers anyone to write a blog post, an essay, or even a novel, and allow anyone online to read the information for free. Then, it could be minted as a paid resources, where people could collect the information and support the author. This provides a good starting point for how we can shape a book store marketplace with the blockchain: transparent content, with unique, limited collectibles. Similarly, if we take a look at other fields like Music: Music NFT now allows anyone to listen to musics, unrestricted to where you’re located (my country cannot listen to Spotify without VPN); and someone could collect the music NFT to support its creator if they really love the music. **Again, free information, paid collectibles.** \n\n> Though, I’m not sure how you write a long novel here if your browser starts lagging trying to cache lots of information in a single page. \n\nIt’s now clear that we want to open up its information, but to sell something else. Let’s see some possibilities of how content creators could earn if they couldn’t earn through information. \n\n## How can Authors Earn? \n\nDon’t expect author to be charity. They also have their burdens that needs money. \n\n### A No No: Sponsorship System. \n\nNope, its not sustainable. There’s a reason why money flows in a closed loop: a large closed loop. A sponsorship system is like publish0x: publish0x tips both the author and the readers. It doesn’t make sense, though. Platform needs to pay both author and readers, but receives nothing in return, and they also need to pay for storage, servers, etc. So, this depends on whether people will donate a large sum of money to keep them running. Whenever donation stops, their platform stops running. Its dependent on rich people to donate a portion of their wealth to the users of the platform. Its non sustainable in the long run, too dependent on a few entities. \n\nMoney derives its value from people’s needs and wants. A sponsorship system is either created by people to attract users to use its platform; or its created by people whom get confused by what blockchain tries to do. Blockchain tries to reward users for some of their actions that we see their **effort** in. They keyword is **effort**. Let’s take a few yes and no. An author writing a blog takes effort. A content creator posting on web3 social media (like [noise.cash](https://noise.cash) or [Myriad Social](https://www.myriad.social)), and reward those that post with coins. But users whom don’t contribute anything except for their time? No, they don’t get rewarded. Instead, they are reading someone else’s information, it makes sense for them to tip the content creators for whatever information they receives that may help them to make money somewhere else; or perhaps that makes them enjoy themselves when they see a funny cat picture. Thinking of rewarding readers for their time is, in my opinion, a deviated view of what blockchain tries to achieve. A user **choose to** (their own choice) read the blog or look through their social media because they wish to relax or learn some information that they don’t know before that. Since they receive something useful (information/emotional enhancement), they pay via token for those whom make their lives better in exchange. They need/want something, so they paid for what they need/what. \n\n> My fellow readers, you don’t have to agree with me to continue reading. :) \n\n### Pre-Sale Benefits\n\nLet’s start with something easy. Those whom own NFTs via pre-sale could read the books 1 month before it’s published to the general audience. Sounds good? Those whom bought the NFT can access a special page where they can watch videos/read books/listen to audiobooks. Or, if these are open (which most probably are, stored on IPFS), we could allow early birds to download the files and watch/read it offline. (Remember, it’s gonna get pirated anyways, so downloading PDF doesn’t need to be encrypted PDF or something). After early access, those people can still buy the NFT after general announcement, for other kinds of benefits. Then, people can read the content (and download the book) for free. ***What, you live on barely 5 dollars per day? It’s okay, forget about the 50+ USD textbooks that are non-affordable, we are free!***\n\n### Additional Benefits\n\nOwners of NFT also owns other benefits, depending on what author provides. For example, taken from learning platform EdX and Pluralsight, you can learn the content for free, but you pay to earn a certificate. Similarly, the certificate could be an NFT, and only owners whom subscribe for an NFT are eligible to take the exam. Or perhaps like language learning platforms, you could learn for free, but access to 1:1 teachings from professionals require payment. Here, owner of NFTs are eligible for 1:1 teachings. Whether or not to have tiers of NFT (like Common, Rare, Legendary) are optional depending on what the author provides. ***As information get unlocked, people earn by paying for others’ time and effort***.\n\n### Extra Time for 1 on 1 (1:1)\n\nMaybe still in a locking sense, people get access to the general book; but to access to author’s experiences on specific problems, whether by asking them 1:1 or author creates another handbook for that, requires an NFT. It’s what you noticed (“experience” or “extra information”) that makes you stand out of the crowd. While people more willingly share basic information, these stuffs that makes you stand out are more closed; and it makes sense for NFT holders to buy these experiences so author are more willing to share their expertise on specific problems. ***Basic information are free, while problem-specific experiences are what makes the differences***.\n\n> Experiences can mean what you deliberately noticed. Read smartcuts Chapter 5 “Waves” for more information.\n>\n> [https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17900734W/Smartcuts_how_hackers_innovators_and_icons_accelerate_success?edition=ia%3Asmartcutshowhack0000snow](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17900734W/Smartcuts_how_hackers_innovators_and_icons_accelerate_success?edition=ia%3Asmartcutshowhack0000snow)\n\n\n### Access to Discussion/Club/DAO\n\nOr perhaps people get access to discussions. For example, some people doesn’t agree with what the book said, and they have their own saying. If the book have a “discussion” tab, NFT holders could commit their ideas. Together, they could update the book (with or without the author) to include stuffs the author missed, not aware of, or perhaps other discussions viewpoints. These could be open or closed, and NFT holders might, together with the author, release a v2 edition of the book after some issues not previously aware of in v1 edition are solved. Then, after v2 edition releases, those holding NFTs can get a split of what’s earned based on their contributions. ***NFT holders are like DAO members, where the DAO is that specific book rather than a general guild/group/community.***\n\n> Though, whether or not this will “inflict some damage” to the author is worth discussing. As in, does the author wants people to make change to their content? Or author have other concerns?\n\nThese are just a few. Who knows if you discover the next innovative solution?\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, as information goes public, as gatekeepers fail to keep information behind gates, it’s time to re-think what we sell. Instead of selling information, one could sell benefits that only book collectors have access to. Ultimately, we aim at provide access to correct, trustworthy information to the general public without worrying about money. We are both a library and a bookseller. People can choose to “borrow” it from the library (read it for free), or they can “buy” a book that they read and goes into their shelf (collect an NFT) (with more benefits than just collecting, perhaps).\n\nSo, it’s time to re-think.\n\n\n---\n\n## Extra: Why a Bookseller on Web3?\n\nYou may have noticed the hints one wrote while reading. First, one tries to sell book on Gumroad, unsuccessfully, because one cannot be paid by PayPal. Then, one tries to sell book on Amazon, and how dark is one’s face when one saw one could only earn 35% out of one’s book! Given the difficulty of being paid, it’s time to move to cryptocurrency.\n\nInitially, web3 comes as a side-product of these motivations. After starting one’s own development, one discovered lots of potential and drawbacks that, either we head butt through them, slicing through all the obstacles that’s on the way to get what we want from the beginning; or we re-think what we want. Honestly, one don’t have the grit to head butt through, nor is one sure that head butt is the right solution; rethinking them seems to fare better, and perhaps provide a brighter future solution.\n\n(this article may be updated in the future).\n\n(pictures taken from Unsplash or Pexels).

Alice 拥有价值 10,000 美元的 cDAI，目前的回报为 10% APY\n2. 爱丽丝丝希望看到下降，所以宁愿将天爱固定90\n3. Alice Voltz并进入90天cDAI池，目前固定为10%\n4.

{"id": "Hu4LKU9UyP48D8ZW44W8bp7Af2Q2zmhsibx8dPEt-UA", "title": "Web3将如何改变人来的未来？", "body": "今年 Web3 是一个非常流行的术语，尤其是被另类金融卡通人物和科技届逻辑缜密的推文串作者频繁提及。\n\n在 2021 年，如果你想筹集第一笔资金，并且躲过投资人的批判性思维，那么可以使用两个\"作弊代码\"，一个是\"Web3\"，另一个是\"元宇宙\"。如果你学会了这些时髦的词语，那么恭喜，你现在有 10 亿美元可以支配，并且还拥有了好的起点，祝你好运，玩得开心。\n\n尽管今天的领袖们发表了大量无特色思想的文章，但仍然没有就\"Web3 到底是什么\"达成共识。\"Web 3\"的定义取决于你属于哪个派别，Web3 是骗局，Web3 是未来，Web3 正在将世界代币化，Web3 是 VC 撤资的借口，Web3 是加密货币的另一个名称，各种声音充斥着我们的耳朵。即使是加密社区也无法确定比特币是否是 web3。\n\n如果\"Web3 是什么\"没有一个统一的定义，并且这个词只是在过去半年里才真正成为流行语，我认为可以得出这样的结论：Web3 还没有真正存在过。然而，很明显，聚合话题下有很多想法和实验不断出圈，旁观者也因此获得了灵感和创造力，亦或是彻底失望。\n\nWeb3 的意义何在\n\n这里我暂不赘述 Web3 无用论的相关看法，我会从 Web3 的用途来思考 Web3 可能的定义。我们是否需要放弃 Web2 ？Web3 解决了什么问题？\n\n我认为有以下两个重要的主题：\n\n**权力的去中心化**\n\n人们对中央集权越来越不信任。无论是政府、中央银行，还是全球科技巨头，都已经变得比国家更强大。去中心化、行为授权和审查制度使人们对建立无信任和抗审查的平台产生了新的兴趣，这些平台可以赋予普通人权力并分割现有的权力结构。\n\n**价值所有权**\n\n随着 Web2 的出现，网络从\"读\"变成了\"读和写\"，变得更具社会性和参与性；用户生成内容的时代开始了。现代科技公司托管来自用户的内容，然后悄悄地货币化。利用我们对社交互动的渴望，并通过令人上瘾的产品模式进行再加工，插入广告，设法将所有用户生成的价值分配给股东。当你能够成为这些公司的股东时，它们的估值已经达到数十亿美元，内部人士已经致富。\n\n一个开放和公平的网络\n\n我理解支持者的兴奋之情。\n\n一个理想化的未来网络也许能够以积极的方式解决这些社会问题，而且还赋予创始人强大的增长和留存工具，与现有企业竞争。\n\n我们可以建立一个网络，让用户能够分享他们创造的价值，并推动采用率。在这样的网络中，不会由技术管理者来决定我们谈论的内容，或者我们每天必须看多少广告。\n\n也许 Web3 可以赋予普通人一些权利，他们在大公司当了数千小时螺丝钉，投入的精力却被收割为私人股东的利润。\n\n也许网络可以变得更加协作化，而不仅仅是榨取。\n\n一切都可以庞氏化\n\n也许更重要的是，我理解评论家的恐惧。\n\n一个悲观的想法是：未来网络可能到处都是代币化的微交易，在所有用户行为上寻租，需要用户拥有原生代币才能正确操作他们的烤面包机。\n\n它可能是这样一种网络：建立在向散户投资者出售无价值的 ERC20 代币基础之上，然后项目失败了。相比花了几年时间才兴起的销售广告，它以更直接的方式来提取价值。\n\n它也可能是这样一种网络：没有足够的手段来处理骚扰或虐待儿童等不良内容，网络犯罪变得更加难以预防。\n\n也许完全的金融化只有利于擅长复杂算法的对冲基金和早期入场的巨型 VC，他们在私募种子轮中成为这些代币的主要所有者。\n\n该走哪条路呢？\n\n如果你能够想象一个愉快的未来和一个反乌托邦的未来，我不会责怪你期望最坏的未来最有可能成为现实。现代企业显然经常使网络更加惹人厌烦：Cookie 权限、数据权限请求、横幅广告、付费专区、战利品箱以及付费游戏或氪金游戏 — 这些都是退而求其次或反用户的改变。\n\n如果跳出圈来看待加密货币，我们无法责怪圈外人看到了一些和骗局极其相似的东西。财富效应助长了加密市场参与者的激烈言行和傲慢，而加密货币文化的自我讽刺本质也让圈外人感到疏远。\n\n我理解。过去有时会很糟糕，现在有时会很糟糕，所以你会强烈地拒绝接受那些你可以找出理论漏洞的想法。不必费力思考，你就能想象出去中心化系统被利用的方式；也不必看得很远，你就能找到利用普通人谋利的代币项目案例。\n\n但与此同时，你不必看得太远，就能看到现有所有者运营系统中所有权和自主自治权的力量。\n\n在没有中央机构干预的情况下，比特币在十年的时间里从\"暗网毒资\"变成了机构认可的价值储存资产。\n\n以太坊从\"技术宅庞氏骗局\"演变成一个庞大的所有者运营网络，每天的交易量达到数十亿。\n\n企业、用户和第三方为这两个网络创造增量价值做出了贡献，并且他们可以共享回报。任何人都可以参与其中并获得价值回馈，而不仅仅只回馈给创始人或投资者。\n\n即使是像 ConstitutionDAO 这样纯粹有趣的社会共识项目，也可能成为所有人之间共享用户生成价值创造的一个例子。尽管未能拍下宪法，但DAO的价值变得更高，而这种价值又重新归于参与者。\n\n也许这种共享所有权可以成为一种强制功能，以打破科技公司可以或应该如何运营的现有惯例。\n\n不平等\n\n不平等的现象变得越来越明显。在疫情期间，资产价格暴涨，富人变得更加富有。与此同时，小企业陷入困境，工人阶级很快就花光了他们的刺激性现金。超过50%的美国人只有不到3个月的紧急储蓄。\n\n工资增长几乎停滞不前，但在过去40年中，房屋成本上涨超过400%。人们已经开始发觉被困在一个不利于自身发展的系统中，他们想要的未来正在迅速溜走。\n\n所以 RobinHood 零售期权交易商和狗狗币买家数量的增加也是情理之中。对于那些无法看见通过储蓄和投资实现财务目标的希望的人来说，彩票式投资已经成为一种可行的选择。\n\n也许一种更社会主义的股权或代币所有权模式可以作为资本主义解决普遍基本收入的答案。与其让国家为家庭印制一点现金，向子孙后代征税以支付这一代人，也许人们共享所生产的财富可以创造一个更加公平的世界。\n\n如果用户通过钱包来投票，选择那些他们已经参与了价值创造并且获得了回报的公司，这些公司将发现巨大的网络效应工具，快速增长并取代现有企业。真正参与的人可以选择拥有他们共同创造的一些价值，而不是将其全部交给创始人和投资者。\n\n如果其他条件相同，在两种相同服务之间，用户更愿意去使用能给他们带来价值回馈的服务。\n\n完美的构思\n\n当比特币被创造出来时，这是另一个完美无暇的概念。在保证所有人的公平地位上，中本聪可能是历史上最重要的创造者之一。没有私自拿走代币的份额，也没有给任何私人投资者。所有用户都是在平等的条件下开采自己的比特币。尽管他们通过早期参与，开采了数百万枚比特币，但除此之外，他们并没有其他更多的优势。\n\n当以太坊创建时，他们预挖了一些代币，并举行了一次自由竞争的公开 ICO。所有人都可以参与，一共出售了60,000,000 [ETH]()，每 ETH 的售价约为 0.3 美元。以太坊的创始人们确实为自己和以太坊基金会预留了一些代币，创始人[Vitalik]() 占比最多，但其获得的比例在 ETH 全部供应量的占比还不到 1% 。与传统股票相比，这个所有权份额占比是相当小的。\n\n虽然与比特币相比，以太坊的成立显得稍微不那么\"公平\"，但它仍然有一个相对公平和开放的参与模式。2017年，ICO 模式流行起来，但随着预售和对内部人员的私下销售等问题出现，这一模式逐渐退化。\n\n2018-2019年，参与者自由竞争的公平条款已成为过去。美国证券交易委员会开始监管 ICO 项目，保护散户的利益。由于监管压力和缺乏明确性，加密货币建设者只能从风险投资公司而不是普通公众那里筹集资金。非内部人士不再可能以早期廉价条款购买代币，而风险投资机构却可以。\n\n你发现了从没有创始人奖励、自由竞争、公平启动的网络过渡到有创始人大量持有、VC 投资、私有化收益的趋势，并对此感到非常悲观。看来中本聪创造的纯洁和美丽已经被贪婪所腐蚀。\n\n但事实是，加密货币现在很受欢迎。当比特币刚出现时，对许多人来说，加密货币的价值并不明显。然而比特币证明了它是有价值的，而以太坊加剧了这种信念。比特币诞生 10 年以来，一直呈现上涨趋势，这吸引了大量风投机构。\n\n当中本聪推出比特币时，挖矿难度非常低，用电脑就可以挖出 50 [BTC]()的区块奖励。未被发现的比特币成为了业余爱好者的公平启动，而不是对冲基金的游乐场。如果今天有一个项目试图以同样的方式推出，已经富有的人将轻松地掌握所有的哈希、积累所有的代币、为获得新项目的份额支付电费。在这样的环境下，创始人还不如直接卖给他们，还能确保长期的资金。\n\n我更倾向于在相同条件下向所有人开放销售，但我也理解创始人不想冒不必要的监管风险，因此与专业投资者打交道更容易，而且开销更低，更何况载体的滥用以及 2017 年大多数的 ICO 都归零了。\n\n在建设未来的同时一定要致富吗？\n\n不会有人认为 Vitalik 不配拥有 ETH 0.7% 的供应量，因为他对以太坊的贡献巨大。同样，也不会有人认为中本聪以不公平的方式挖出了 100 万枚比特币。\n\n然而，无法忽视的是，Web3 的最大支持者是那些已经获得成功的风险投资家。有点讽刺，但不奇怪，这些实体正试图通过在种子轮中以低价购买多数股权，成为这个这个乌托邦式的、共享的和社区自治的经济体的超级投资者。\n\n同样不能忽视的是，只顾着抢钱的创始人和投资者利用现有的市场动态，创造出庞然大物式的牛市项目来充实自己的钱包。\n\n因此，我认为有四件事是真的：\n\n人们一致认为，创始人在世界上创造巨大价值时致富是当之无愧的，也是意料之中的。\n\n有一个粗略的共识，风险投资公司或天使投资人早期的资助也是提供服务，当他们资助的项目为世界创造巨大价值时，也应该得到回报。\n\n许多人认为这些融资机会应该是公开和公平的，拒绝现有合规的投资者规则，认为其过于家长制或是反直觉的（耶，现在我们可以从风险机构那里高价接盘！）。\n\n每个人都讨厌创始人或风险投资人不做出任何价值贡献就可以获得财富。\n\n不可否认，最后一点现在已经在加密世界中变得普遍。许多未完全开发的产品的 CEO 一夜之间成为了亿万富翁，仅仅是通过发行代币和承诺做出 NFT 驱动的电子游戏，或者建立一个活跃用户只有两位数的\"Web3\"平台。\n\n总结\n\nWeb3 还不存在。牛市中有大量的旁氏骗局，评估它的价值可能并不准确，但是，忽视市场的动态变化也是不客观的。\n\n我认为现实世界和 Web2 的社会问题是存在且值得解决的，在 Web3 的愿景中，有很多东西令人期待。\n\n我认为开放、透明和无许可的系统取代中央机构对世界是有益的，可以重新平衡和分散权力。\n\n我希望加密市场的金融繁荣能够吸引聪明的头脑，远离向人们推销广告，而是建立一个更加公平和合作的未来。\n\n但是，如果加密项目创始人变得富有而不再关心他们的项目，并且新网络是由后期资本主义贪婪军团建立的，那么我不会感到惊讶，这些贪婪的公司让你在[Cardano]() 上购买一个碎片化小额支付 NFT 来操作你的电动牙刷。\n\n后话\n\n我知道我被引诱进入了一场无结果的辩论中，这些亿万富翁都是在 Facebook 时代的网络中致富的。说实话，他们辩论的结果并不重要，因为他们不再是未来的冒险者和建设者。也许他们是金融家，但他们的幂律曲线模型已经说明了他们错的比对的多。 ", "timestamp": 1654310000, "digest":

IC設計業的財報分析重點。\n\n \n 財報思維的IC設計業分類\n\n依使用目的不同，IC設計業可依產品別細分為數位IC與類比IC，進一步則可細分為LED驅動IC、光驅動IC……等。本文重點是從財報看IC設計業，分類即以影響財務結構之因素為重點。會計重視收入成本配合原則，隱含的就是經濟學上「天下沒有白吃的午餐」概念。分類上可以從收入面思考，不同的收入是否需使用不同的資源？**而所使用資源的不同，則可能造成公司損益表上成本與費用的組成暨資產負債表上資產與負債組成有所不同。**基於前述思維，可將IC設計業做以下分類：\n\n### 矽智財授權\n\n設計IC的過程中，有些模組可被重用，透過這些模組來設計IC，就可省下很多時間。有些公司看中這個商機，就專門開發這些IC模組(矽智財)，授權並出售相關的軟體開發工具給IC設計公司獲利，如[ARM](https://www.arm.com/)就是其中的代表。\n\n### 設計代工服務\n\n這類服務較接近字面上「IC設計」的概念。市場上有些客戶的產品規格較特殊，現有之IC無法滿足其需求，需要一顆特殊規格的IC(ASIC)以滿足其需求，通常有多樣少量及需求急的特色。委託設計開發(Non-Recurring Engineering)的需求應運而生，亦有公司瞄準這塊市場，以可接受的時間，幫客戶把IC設計出來。惟基於營收的考量，純以設計代工為主的公司較少見，企業通常還是會自行設計與銷售IC。創意與智原為這類公司的代表。\n\n### 自設自銷\n\n標題之所以不用常見的「自製自銷」，是因為如果產品是自己製造，那就不是IC設計公司了。自設自銷類的公司雖不自己製造，但也非純提供設計服務，而是自行設計，委託製造，再自行銷售。這是台灣IC設計產業最常見之模式，產業之代表如聯發科。\n\n### 分類的意義\n\n前述分類係基於收入組成、成本與所用資源不同所做的分類。**所用資源可以理解為資產負債表上的資產。**面對市場上的需求，企業可以有不同的選擇來滿足，它可以弱水三千，只取一瓢飲；當然也可以大小通吃。半導體業從一開始[真男人就是要擁有晶圓廠](https://ctee.com.tw/news/tech/309977.html)的IDM(註2)模式，到專業晶圓代工廠，代表的是交易的切割與分工。整段交易既然通過分工完成，**利潤自然依照貢獻度分配**，**貢獻度來自企業所掌握與使用的資源**。有些資源因為會計原則認列的問題，沒有辦法在資產負債表上呈現，但會藉由市場賦予較高本益比的方式反映。\n\n舉例來說，提供IC設計服務的A公司與自設自銷的B公司，所賺取的收入類型不同，B公司提供了存貨的買賣，得找晶圓廠代工。製造完了想順利賣出去，就得養一批員工行銷。呈現在損益表上，B公司收入較高，成本也相對較高(包括存貨成本與薪資費等)，同時帳上亦持有較多的資產(包括應收帳款與存貨等)。相對而言，IC設計服務之主要成本僅為人工，故A公司收入較少，但毛利率會較高。\n\n## IC設計業的財報分析重點\n\n### 不動產、廠房及設備比重低\n\n半導體產業發展至今，分工是其中一個重要的演變，屬重資本投入的半導體產業，許多業者紛紛不當真男人了。Foundry廠扮演了產業鏈中的製造角色，擁有主要的廠房及設備，IC設計公司帳上的廠房及設備比重則相對較低。比較「1600 不動產、廠房及設備」這個科目，2021年度個體財報(避免轉投資業別不同影響比較)，晶圓代工廠代表之台積電，不動產、廠房及設備佔總資產比重高達56%，凌陽、聯發科及瑞昱等IC設計公司則僅介於6%\\~7%之間。\n\n### 現金及投資部位大\n\n只要經營上了軌道，IC設計公司營運規模擴大時毋須投入過多的資本支出，容易累積現金，致現金及長短期投資的部位較大。首先可觀察個體財報中的「1550 採用權益法之投資」，須注意的是其中有些轉投資係基於業務需要，而由其持有具控制力比例的股權，故可另外參考**財報附註十三(二)**(不包含大陸被投資公司)與**附註十三(三)**(大陸投資資訊)，檢視其中是否有非100%持有的公司?該非100%持有的公司是賺錢還是虧錢?轉投資公司的業務內容是什麼?會建議做這樣的檢視，主要是因為常有無良的經營團隊，透過新設子公司，及後續一波波的增資，將原應屬公司所擁有之價值洗出去為個人所有，這些都是要特別注意的。\n\n另外透過檢視附註中這些轉投資公司的「主要營業項目」欄，則可進一步判斷轉投資這些公司的合理性，是否不務正業？過往企業海外投資，習慣透過在英屬維京群島等租稅天堂設立控股公司的方式進行，所以看到營業項目是「對各種事業之投資」也不必然就有問題，有可能是控股公司下再設實質營運公司。\n\n接下來須進一步檢視合併財報，才能以鳥瞰的方式瞭解集團真實的財務結構。重點包括現金及非屬業務投資，為純財務投資的內容。檢視2021年合併財報，這些現金及投資部位(註3)，佔凌陽、聯發科及瑞昱等IC設計公司資產的比率，高達40%\\~60%。**較高的現金及投資部位，是這個產業的一大特色，應瞭解如何企業如何運用及其中潛藏的風險。**\n\n### 相對較大的無形資產\n\n相較其他產業，IC設計公司無形資產的部位較大，不過佔資產的比例，平均來說還是不至於過高。帳上無形資產的來源可分為兩大類，第一類是為了設計IC而買入的專利權或專門技術，另一類則係因合併所帶入的專利權、專門技術及商譽。對於商譽，投資人應該注意的有幾點：\n\n1. 怎麼來的？\n2. 是否還有價值？\n3. 無形資產認列之減損金額。\n\n當企業併購另外一家企業時，淨值只是其中一個參考因素，併購價格不會剛好等於淨值，當價格高於淨值時，會計入帳前即須先分析其組成，當可辨識的資產都歸屬完畢後，其他不可辨識的部分就會被歸類為商譽。財務上認為這是標的公司賺取超額報酬的能力，可能是基於較佳的管理能力……等所產生。相較於許多投資者擔心的無形資產高估問題，無形資產認列的減損更值得注意。投資者應瞭解，企業並非主動認列了減損就是保守，就沒有問題了。應進一步瞭解認列減損的無形資產當初是透過甚麼方式認列的?交易對象是誰?決策過程如何?無形資產看不到也摸不到，有心人有可能透過這種方式掏空公司資產。透過購入資產名義五鬼搬運後，再一次性打消無形資產，船過水無痕。另外前一季財報尚無任何跡象，本期財報就突然提列鉅額減損的公司，也要特別注意。無形資產會在短期內突然失去效力嗎?技術的進步再快，公司的衰敗再迅速，應不至於在個月內就產生翻天覆地變化吧?當第三季財報所呈現出的情況是歲月靜好，怎麼會在年報就突然認列鉅額減損？以前各期財報的出具難道沒有問題？若再透過股票價量變化，這些訊息都可透露出管理階層的誠信，投資者應該特別留意。\n\n### 高毛利率與研發費用率\n\n由於IC設計業者並無晶圓廠，主要靠技術賺錢，通常有40%以上的高毛利率。設計純度越高的公司，毛利率會越高，故矽智財授權>設計代工>自設自銷。營業費用率大約30%左右，毛利率倘未達40%，扣減營業費用率後的營業淨利率會很低，除非是量大的利基產品，否則經營起來會很辛苦。\n\n營業費用中以研發費用所佔的比重最高，由於IC產品的生命週期很短，往往在一顆新功能IC上市前，企業即已開始規劃下一代IC的研發。不停的與時間賽跑，追趕與突破技術，就是IC設計公司的宿命，故研發費用比重常高達20%\\~30%。\n\n這種財報上的特徵，其實是因為會計的穩健保守原則所造成。基於成本收入配合原則，IC研發過程中所發生的費用，包括人員薪資、光罩……等，是為了帶來未來收入所必需的支出，理論上應該要配合收入一起認列，但會計規定，支出必須符合一定條件才能資本化，故使相關支出在當期費用化後，未來期間才認列收入，所以前期可能虧損，後期卻有較高的毛利率。研發費用率高，則是企業若不想淪為一代拳王，不想坐吃山空，就不得不一路狂奔下，而產生高額研發費用。從另一個角度看，IC設計公司的研發支出與晶圓代工廠所蓋的晶圓廠有何不同？不過是一個有形，一個無形。會計上對於有形的資產是先認定有價值後，才去評估是否具有經濟價值而需認列減損。無形的資產則須符合一定條件，才能被認列為資產。**兩種不同思維，造成認列為資產的難易度不同。**\n\n## 結論\n\n投資是門藝術，其中涉及許多主觀判斷。即便你是價值分析的信徒，都不要期待可直接由財報看出一家企業價值多少錢。正確看待財報的態度，應該是把財報當作一把尺，事先對這把尺到底是公分還是英吋有所概念，才能正確地比較不同物品的長短，長短不是絕對的概念，而是比較下的結果。\n\nIC設計業依其「純度」之不同，又可分為矽智財授權、設計代工服務與自設自銷等，實務上公司常同時經營一類以上業務。以財報做產業分析，會建議採取這樣的分類，主要是基於要產生哪一類型的收入，會動用哪一類型的資源，以及產生哪一類型的成本。分析一家公司前，應先確定其所屬產業及收入組成，再調動你知識庫中，對於這個產業財務數字的預設值。比較目標公司與產業預設值，再進一步瞭解差異原因，你就可以對目標公司的實際表現有更深入的瞭解。\n\n**註釋**\n\n註1：若想知道某類產業涵蓋那些上市櫃公司，或是想瞭解某家上市櫃公司是屬於哪個產業，可參考主管機關設立的[產業價值鏈資訊平台](https://ic.tpex.org.tw/index.php)。\n\n註2：Integrated device manufacturer,垂直整合製造。\n\n註3：包含「1100 現金及約當現金」、「1110 透過損益按公允價值衡量之金融資產-流動」、「1120 透過其他綜合損益按公允價值衡量之金融資產-流動」、「1136 按攤銷後成本衡量之金融資產-流動」、「1510 透過損益按公允價值衡量之金融資產-非流動」、「1517 透過其他綜合損益按公允價值衡量之金融資產-非流動」、「1535按攤銷後成本衡量之金融資產-非流動」與「1550 採用權益法之投資」等。欲進一步瞭解投資之標的內容，則可參考附註十三(一)(3)。", "timestamp": 1654312186, "digest": "28c5qVnXRnyuGBCLm_GTD26I3MXqc5YrULwKa-D4YJE", "contributor": "0xc79EbA9f80ee4607D880B87a680E089DCbEBe0Df"}

{"id": "ye7-JRGghwaxWK8fjoSyxnRgf06mTnm11vqj8Ep_ibI", "title": "skiff使用说明", "body": "web3应用skiff使用说明和遇到的一些问题及解决办法\n\nskiff作为主攻文档编辑和邮箱的web3产品，自问世以来吸引了众多web3用户的眼球，对于那些隐私要求高的用户来说，无疑有很强的实用价值。小编对这种产品期待已久，自然会体验一番。在使用过程中遇到过一些问题，经过摸索和尝试最终都一一解决。下面把我的初步使用心得呈现给大家，不妥不到之处，还请各位多多指正。\nskiff产品目前分为两类，一类是skiff文档编辑；一类是skiff邮箱。在电脑网页端，这两类产品共享一个登录页面；在手机端，分别开发出了skiff和skiff mail两个app（手机端因体验不多，从略）。\n一、先从登录说起。有两种注册方法，一是用metamask钱包注册，二是用web2邮箱注册。前者点击页面右上角connect wallet,按照提示一步步操作即可，这个过程基本都不会遇到什么问题。但是，如果想通过钱包注册多个账户时就会遇到问题。\n1\\.链接新钱包后，内部页面还停留在原钱包地址账户页面，甚至点击刷新也不起作用。这种情况是因为上次登录的钱包还没有退出，浏览器会自动保存上次关闭时的登录设置，下次打开浏览器时会默认为原钱包登录信息。解决办法，退出原登录钱包后，刷新浏览器，再用新钱包链接登录，即可弹出新的注册页面。（建议用户在使用该产品时养成好习惯，要更换账户就及时退出原账户）\n2\\.在退出原钱包后，用新钱包注册新账户时，还是无法跳到注册页面，同时还提示进行人机验证。这种情况可能是因为使用一个IP地址注册的账户过多，建议先关闭浏览器，更换IP地址，再重启浏览器，重新链接新钱包注册。\n3\\.如果上面1和2都解决不了，建议打开浏览器设置——隐私与安全设置，清除浏览器数据，先清空24小时浏览数据，如果不管用，再往前清7日、4周及以上。\n4\\.用web2邮箱注册时还没有遇到过什么问题，欢迎遇到问题的朋友进行反馈，咱们共同研究解决。\n登录也分为两种情况，一是用以太坊地址注册的用户，既可以通过钱包地址登录，也可以通过web2邮箱登录（前提是，已经设置好登录Email address）；二是用web2邮箱注册的用户只能通过该邮箱登录。\n二、下面对skiff产品的settings功能进行详解，settings功能搞清楚了，对这款产品也就了解个七大八。\n（一）Profile & Appearance功能，\n1\\.Display name（显示名称），用地址登录后，显示整个地址（42位），建议改个简短好记的名称；用web2邮箱登录后，显示邮箱名称。\n2、3.设置背景色及日期格式，在此不做解释。\n（二）Security（安全）功能\n1\\.Account recovery，选择此项，在忘记密码的情况下，可以通过注册账户时使用的邮箱恢复账户。\n2\\.Two-factor authentication，开启此项，可通过绑定身份验证器，在登录账户时进行双重验证，安全性更高。\n3\\.Change password，更改登录密码。\n（三）Verification功能\n2\\.Verification phrase，其他用户通过此核验短语可以验证你的身份，建议把方框中显示的核验短语保存到一个安全的地方。\n（四）Account功能，\n此项既包含设置skiff文档账户，又包含设置skiff邮箱账户。因此，很容易使人搞混，错以为两个账户是一回事，认为在此处设置了一个地址或是邮箱，就可以在两个账户通用，其实不然，两个账户是分开的，分别有各自的名称。\n1\\.Storage format（存储方式）分为Skiff server与IPFS两种，建议选择IPFS。\n2\\.Email address，此地址是web2邮箱地址。此项设置分两种情况，一种情况是用web2邮箱注册的用户，登录时此处自动显示注册的邮箱地址，因此不需要再设置；另一种情况是用web3地址注册的用户，登录时此处为空，因此可以添加自己已经注册过的web2邮箱地址，这样一来，在以后登录skiff时，既可以用web3地址，也可以用web2邮箱登录（建议设置上web2邮箱地址，以方便在手机端用web2邮箱登录使用）\n3\\.Email aliases，注意：此项功能仅针对skiff邮箱，与skiff文档没啥关系。同时skiff邮箱可以设置为web3邮箱（是去中心化的点对点加密邮箱，隐私属性更强）。邮箱别名可以设置多个，系统要求每个名称必须不低于7位。另外，使用Email aliases功能添加的邮箱别名，不可更改，不可删除，因此要想好名字再设置。\n4\\.Wallet aliases，此项功能也仅针对skiff邮箱，在注册完skiff账户时，在页面上方会有一行文字提示“claim account\" skiff mail (申领skiff邮箱），点击进去，在申领邮箱页面会出现两个选项，一是给skiff邮箱取个名，按照规则设置名称即可；二是链接web3钱包地址，这时如果你所用浏览器已安装eth等钱包，点击链接批准确认就可以用相应的钱包地址给这个skiff邮箱命名（名称格式为：地址@skiff.com)。如果skiff账户是用web3钱包注册的，则可以将该地址直接添加为skiff邮箱别名。Wallet aliases可以设置多种钱包、多个web3地址，但是设置完成后不可删除，不可更改。\n5\\.ENS aliases，此项功能没有具体体验过，但是，如果你用来设置skiff邮箱的以太坊钱包注册了ENS域名，那此处会自动显示为“ENS域名@skiff.com”\n6\\.Notifications，app及邮件通知，建议都打开。\n（五）Plans功能。涉及到该产品的奖励及收费标准，用户可自行了解。\n三、skiff文档编辑\n点击左侧new page,右侧显示文档编辑页面，确定好标题，开始编辑文档内容。该软件对用户编辑内容是即时保存的，很方便。编辑器中涉及字体、颜色、函数、表格、代码等多种工具，小编只是初步体验了一下最基本的文字功能。\n四、skiff邮箱\n1\\.邮箱与文档功能切换是在页面左上角（显示两排信息），点击后，弹出一个小窗口，第一行标有邮件图标，点击一下就切换到skiff邮箱；第二行，标有小人形图标，点击可切换到skiff文档；第四行，创建工作空间，可通过email邀请多人加入空间，共享资源，协同工作。第五行，退出账户。\n2\\.收发邮件。首先明确一下，目前，用skiff邮箱既可以与skiff邮箱相互收发邮件，又可以与传统的web2邮箱相互收发邮件，打通了web2与web3之间的连接。注意，向skiff邮箱发邮件时，目的地邮件地址（Email aliases、Wallet aliases、ENS aliases）是等效的，无论用哪一个地址都能收到信息。\n五、忘记密码\n1\\.如果skiff账户是用web3地址注册的，不用设置登录密码，直接用地址登录即可，不涉及忘记密码问题。\n2\\.如果skiff账户是用web2邮箱注册的，需要设置登录密码，如果忘记密码，需要通过该web2邮箱找回密码。", "timestamp": 1654313881, "digest": "5b1FT1x_rS25EdVTHWSsFWdpB7PP613D2yl4Mr3l6WA", "contributor": "0xd59515Ed5d580246e82e90eD2673d78039eF8fC6"}

up,关于技术方面的解释对于大多数人来讲比较晦涩难懂，那本文就用最简单的方式来讲解下L2的原理 一堆人想要把钱存进银行，如果办理业务人太多会导致银行的工作达到一个饱和状态从而导致效率大大降低，L2的出现相当于是用户把钱都放到了一个管家进行托管，由管家整理好之后带入银行，从而大大缓解了银行的工作量。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gF55wXm5oOZ03z494ifES.png?height=5145&width=12589)\n\n大致了解过后，我们再来进一步讲解：Optimistic roll up与ZK roll up 的区别， Optimistic 的特点是 先把用户的数据处理好之后直接传给主链，7天之内有任何问题再把证据提交给主链，主链再帮用户把问题解决 ,特点是交易速度快！ ZK roll up的 机制与 Optimistic 机制相反，是先检查数据之后再发送到主网，所以相对来说交易速度相对较慢。\n\n官网也有许多信息可以查看，有想深入了解的朋友可以去看一下\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SyMpXtseub2cbCfPlmnpU.png?height=2197&width=12589)\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~[点击链接进入官网主页](https://zksync.io/)\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5qjujnrbk-bLZcZ8_bFbA.png?height=1299&width=12500)\n\n###

{"id": "5W44tL65dau6mKbDyHbU198q70ncC6pORCanm66glbg", "title": "5 Key  Insights From Olympus", "body": "MetricsDAO analysts have been busily digging into the Tokenomics, Treasury, price and returns data and all things Olympus, over the last several weeks. From question generation through bounty submissions and review, we generated a large number of quality visualizations and data tables freely accesible to the community.\n\nThe diversity of submissions affords one the opportunity to see the same data from different perspectives, which can then be further analyzed with a ready to use table of data.\n\nThese analyses are publically available. Not only are the specific questions addressed, but one can easily extrapolate on the conclusions, iterating on the initial findings in a constantly evolving process to extract additonal insights.\n\nAs one who both submits and evaluates analysts’ submissions, I was exposed to a large amount of this data and came across a few insights which stand out.\n\n## Insight # 1: The Price of gOHM has recently been outperforming traditional and crypto markets\n\n![A slightly overdramatized chart comparing stocks, bonds, gold, Ethereum and Bitcoin with gOHM](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FrfSY28Vbe149ez3eQkkNI.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nA slightly overdramatized chart comparing stocks, bonds, gold, Ethereum and Bitcoin with gOHM\n\ngOHM represents the returns on staking plus the compounding staking returns. More later. For now just think of a stock which pays dividends.\n\nThis graph definitely depicts a new pattern, as zooming back to the beginning of April, we can see that, for the most part, gOHM moved in step with BTC and ETH. One can construct narratives all day, in an attempt to explain why this is occuring and a two week interval is a ridiculously small time interval to consider, but it is certainly worth noting and a shot in the arm for long term OHM community members who have not had a lot to cheer about this year.\n\n![Zooming out for perspective: the price performance is a recent phenomenon](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FXkanpbEL5Gje4kXVNwKXL.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\nZooming out for perspective: the price performance is a recent phenomenon\n\n## Insight #2: Bond discounts are at an all time high for the year\n\nThis is the discount received from “bonding”, reflecting the difference in the discounted rate of OHM, compared to the market. It is the principle mechanism which Olympus uses to build their reserves. When viewed as a percentage of price, we see a choppy distribution.\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FIq13z7YEU3CTpFgBjEqol.jpg&w=1920&q=90)\n\nComparing the premium percentage with price reveals the next insight.\n\n## Insight #3: There is little, if any, correlation between the premium and the price\n\n![Premium rate at different prices](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FDxjrCNIC3J3VnZMqS-ZR-.png&w=1920&q=90)\n\nPremium rate at different prices\n\nWe do see that, when the price was higher than 100 dollars that there was a very consistent rate, just above 1%. The rate has jumped around significantly when the price is less than $50.\n\n## Insight #4: Staking the Olympus Way — Rebasing\n\nWhen you stake your OHM, you are entitled to a generous reward rate, which compounds three times a day. the gOHM governance token referenced above, in the sexy chart, is issued 1:1 for OHM. Instead of increasing your supply of gOHM, the reward is indexed and, at the time one unstakes, they get the appropriate amount. The reward received depends on two factors.\n\n* The reward rate – Set by governance and approved by vote. Currently this is .1587\n\n![The \"rebasing\" reward yield formula](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FPwDMV3qv8QhIIcb2sMExc.jpg&w=828&q=90)\n\nThe \"rebasing\" reward yield formula\n\nSimplifying a bit more we get\n\n![The reward yield formula. This compounds every 2200 Ethereum blocks which works out to once ever 8 hours or so or three times per day](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FLolQU8f4Jtr4FxrO188Z0.jpg&w=640&q=90)\n\nThe reward yield formula. This compounds every 2200 Ethereum blocks which works out to once ever 8 hours or so or three times per day\n\nNote that the yield formula is based on the assumption of a constant price of OHM. Therefore, given a drop in price from over 1000 to slightly below 20 USD, the rebase rate doesn’t help. Also, there is no rebasing if there is not an equivalent amount of reserves to back it.\n\n### Good News: 465% APR Bad News: down from 4738%\n\n![Monthly yields and APY based on a constant OHM price](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fb3l8IpabCIh97rmROxa2y.jpg&w=3840&q=90)\n\nMonthly yields and APY based on a constant OHM price\n\nSadly, the price action and the rewards can’t be separated, so it isn’t like you are receiving passive income. You only get that after you unstake. The declining APR to “only” 465% is a result of Olympus governance tweaking the rewards rate. It is not a result of the price drop directly, although price informs the decision. gOHM can be purchased on exchanges, and the yields are incorporated into the price. There is an index which incorporates the rewards rate and supply so you are automatically staking. There is no good reason to not stake OHM unless of course it is to sell.\n\n## Insight #5: Treasury Tracking is Tricky\n\nA few weeks ago, one of MetricDAO’s bounty assignments was to track the Olympus DAO’s treasury balance over time. Most of the analysts operated under the assumption that the main treasury contract address contained the bulk of the assets.\n\n![Olympus Treasury. Left: Composite treasury assets for 2022. Right: the distribution of tokens in the treasury are comprised mainly of stable coins with WETH the exception. The OHM of course is not used to compute backing. The \"other\" sliver is a hodge podge of small experimental investments.](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F8FX46aWxSuq6OI999VE20.jpg&w=3840&q=90)\n\nOlympus Treasury. Left: Composite treasury assets for 2022. Right: the distribution of tokens in the treasury are comprised mainly of stable coins with WETH the exception. The OHM of course is not used to compute backing. The \"other\" sliver is a hodge podge of small experimental investments.\n\nNot so!\n\nIn fact, there are eleven other addresses belonging to the treasury. This is part of the strategy of “protocol owned liquidity”. In addition to the “risk free value” backing, Olympus earns revenue through staking and providing liquidity to DEX pools as well as staking the protocols which they interact with.\n\nOverall, we can see that it is primarily made up of relatively stable assets. Knowing what we know about algorithmic stable-coins and government crack downs, we can’t actually look at them as “risk free”, and with 8% allocated towards ETH, there will be some movement, but this is in line with the notion of a floating peg as opposed to reliance on fiat currencies.\n\n### Bonus insights:\n\n* **Olympus owns over 99% of its liquidity**\n\n  This may be the most important insight. It represents a new paradigm shift in the world of decentralized finance (aka DeFi) — rather than relying on predatory “yield farmers”, who will run the moment the rewards go away, dumping on the protocol and leaving the latecomers holding the bags. They also are supporting other protocols in the space, helping them with *their* liquidity.\n* **Recently Released “inverse bonds” add an important weapon to the Olympus arsenal.**\n\n  When price is declining, these bonds are issued to absorb selling pressure. These are only in place when there is reserve backing. While the ultimate goal is to continue to increase the supply of OHM, it must be managed carefully and reducing the supply, at a discount, helps protect the price. In a bull markekt, the priority is on building up the reserves.\n\n## Overall Insight:\n\nThe Olympus protocol is multi-faceted and was a real challenge for the bounty contestants. Price action, treasury balance, staking rewards, bonding premium data comes to life when collective analytical minds are able to bounce ideas off each other, armed with curated, publically available data.\n\nThanks to @rplust, @sociocrypto, @zook, @marqu, @jhackworth and anyone else I missed for your analyses and queries.\n\nI found three great Dune dashboards on Olympus\n\nour very own @ilemi aka Andrew, genesis member of “OurNetworkLearn” and of course Mirror.xyz fame, did a very nice description of the bonding process:\n\n@shadow produced this and several other dashboards on Olympus/ OHM\n\nLast but not least, @fluidsonic, who produced **[this gem](https://dune.com/fluidsonic/Olympus-DAO)**", "timestamp": 1654311309, "digest": "w9j4fhQUM7Yb8dEYY7n9TQ_rwi_HEiQlRSQhcwk_sQA", "contributor": "0x51062AF21E68007edfa5D4f8c19B59DeF76aBF4c"}

{"id": "KhAwwq4N1l4bTnKqFkqyw0xPuNz_wFWui-10SOp782Q", "title": "区块链投研-比特币（BTC）", "body": "\n研究学习，迎接加密世界的浪潮，By eth8848.eth。\n\\#BTC #区块链投研 #eth8848\n\n1. **项目简介**\n   1. 英文名 Bitcoin ，简写 BTC ；\n   2. 创建时间：2009年1月3日；\n   3. 代币总量：2,100万；到2140年时，将不再有新的比特币产生。\n   4. 是一种基于去中心化，采用点对点网络与共识主动性，开放源代码，以区块链作为底层技术的加密货币，比特币由中本聪（网名）（Satoshi Nakamoto）于2008年10月31日发表论文，2009年1月3日，创世区块（Genesis Block） 诞生，共50个比特币奖励。\n      1\\. 简而言之：一种建立在p2p和密码学基础上的电子货币。\n   5. 通常，首字母大写的“Bitcoin”是指其所使用的比特币技术与网络，而首字母小写的“bitcoin”才是指货币本身。\n   6. 作为记账系统，比特币不依赖中央机构发行新钱、维护交易，而是由区块链完成，用数字加密算法、全网抵御51%算力攻击保证资产与交易的安全。交易记录以被全体网络电脑收录维护，每笔交易的有效性都必须经过区块链检验确认。\n   7. 作为记账单位，比特币的最小单位是 0.00000001 （一亿分之一）比特币，称为“1聪”。如有必要，也可以修改协议将其分割为更小的单位，以保证其流通方便。区块奖励起初为50个比特币，每出210,000（21万）个区块后，奖励减半，差不多每4年减半一次。\n2. **团队成员**\n   1. 中本聪（网名）（Satoshi Nakamoto）；\n   2. Github contributors：<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors>\n3. **白皮书**\n   1. 白皮书地址\n      1\\. <https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf>\n   2. 白皮书主要内容\n      1\\. 允许任何两个有意愿的当事人直接进行交易，而不需要一个信任的第三方；\n      2\\. 工作量证明解决“双重支付”问题；\n4. **特征**\n   1. 去中心化\n      1\\. 对协议的修改必须由用户达成共识，并且应该有广泛的支持者的声音，这包括“节点”、最终用户、开发人员、矿工和相关行业参与者（如交易所、钱包服务提供商和托管机构）。这使比特币成为一个准政治系统。\n   2. 分布式\n      1\\. 所有比特币交易都记录在一个叫做区块链的公共账本上。\n   3. 透明\n      1\\. 向区块链账本添加新的交易、比特币网络在任何特定时间的状态（即“事实”） 均按照协议规则，以透明的方式达成共识。\n   4. 点对点\n      1\\. 不需要任何“受信任的第三方”来充当中介。\n   5. 无需许可\n      1\\. 任何人都可以使用比特币。\n   6. 伪匿名\n      1\\. 身份信息不与比特币交易相关联。\n   7. 抗审查\n      1\\. 监管机构很难禁止个人使用比特币或扣押他们的比特币资产。\n   8. 公开\n      1\\. 所有的比特币交易都被记录下来，而且任何人都可以查看。\n      2\\. 几乎消除了欺诈的可能性，但也导致在某些情况下，通过推断可以将个人身份与特定的比特币地址关联在一起。\n5. **经济模型**\n   1. 固定的供应量\n      1\\. 代币总量：2,100万；到2140年时，将不再有新的比特币产生。\n   2. 抗通胀\n      1.  1.  按照内置于代码中的时间表，比特币产生速度会逐渐减慢。比特币大约每 10 分钟增加一个新区块， 从每个区块 50 个比特币开始，大约每四年会减半一次。 \n      2. 2. 第1次减半：2012年11月28日，从每个区块 50 个比特币减少到 25 个； \n      3. 3. 第2次减半：2016年7月9日，从每个区块 25 个比特币减少到 12.5 个； \n      4. 4. 第3次减半：2020 年 5 月，发行速度从每个区块 12.5 个比特币减少到 6.25 个； \n      5. 5. 第4次减半：2024 年，发行速度从每个区块 6.25 个比特币减少到 3.125  个。 \n      6. 6. 预计2136 年，将发生最后一次减半，届时区块奖励将减少到只有 0.00000168 BTC。\n   3. 激励驱动 \n      1. 1.  核心参与者矿工受利益驱动，通过工作量证明 (PoW) 的过程，相互竞争着向构成账本（区块链）的链上添加新的区块。与 PoW 挖矿相关的硬件和能源成本以去中心化的方式以博弈论驱动的原则促进了网络安全。 \n      2. 2. 比特币挖矿本质上是找到一个密码学问题的答案，这个密码学的问题没有捷径可走，每个人都只能按照给定的计算方式去穷举计算，你的设备计算性能越好，越有可能先算出答案。 \n      3. 3. 盈利动机被认为是赋予内生增长的重要因素。\n   4. 51%问题\n      1. 1. 算力达到 51%，就可以发动攻击，控制网络。但是这违反攻击者的利益。\n      2. 2. 花费大量金钱，购买矿机，若比特币共识崩塌（有人可以操纵账本及假账），比特币价格将暴跌，攻击获得的比特币将一文不值，同时手里的矿机也无法售出。\n6. **运行逻辑**\n   1. 地址与私密密钥 \n      1. 1.  创建比特币账户时，先会随机生成一个 256 位的二进制数字作为私钥，然后再通过一系列的密码学运算算出你的地址，两者一一对应。\n         1. 用椭圆曲线数字签名算法(ECDSA)对私钥进行运算，生成公钥，再对公钥进行哈希运算，就得到了地址。\n      2. 2. 地址\n         1. 1. 地址用于接收比特币，功能类似银行的存款账号，但不需要实名登记，也没有任何身份信息，也可以离线产生。   \n         2. 2. 传统比特币地址区分大小写，但不包括“IlO0”等字符，“1”开头的地址长26\\~34位，“3”开头的地址长34位，例如\"1DwunA9otZZQyhkVvkLJ8DV1tuSwMF7r3v\"。   \n         3. 3. 可用的比特币地址数量接近2^161个。形象地说，假如地球上约有2^63粒沙，那么比特币地址总数远远超过地球上所有沙子的数量（大约是沙子数目的平方的350亿倍）。 3.\n      3. 私密密钥\n         1. 1. 比特币的私密密钥（私钥，private key），作用相当于金融卡提款或消费的密码，用于证明比特币的所有权。   \n         2. 2. 拥有者必须使用私钥给交易消息签名，以证明消息的发布者是相应地址的所有者，没有私钥，就不能给消息签名，作为不记名货币，网络上无法认得所有权的证据，也就不能使用比特币。   \n         3. 3. 比特币私密密钥通常由51比特或52比特字符表示。51比特标记法由数字“5”开头，52位标记法由“K”或“L”开头。比特币地址是由比特币公开密钥进行散列运算得出的，公开密钥是可以通过私密密钥推算出的。所以掌握私密密钥就可以推算出私密密钥对应的地址（不可逆），这相当于只需要输入一组正确的密码，就可以推算出账户名称并登录，而无法从账户名称反向推算出密码般。\n   2. 挖矿\n      1. 1. 为了获得系统每十分钟奖励的比特币，找到让账册区块难以被恶意修改但是却易于验证的数学难题，此过程犹如开采矿物一样困难，故称为“挖矿”，使用矿机挖矿的人被称为“矿工”。 \n      2. 2. 比特币的发行\n         1. 先计算出 的矿工把消息广播出去，经过全网络确认之后，他会凭空得到一些bitcoin。这个过程叫挖矿(mining)。\n      3. 3. 比特币程序每隔2016个区块就自动调节一次的，根据之前出块速度和之前难度目标反推全网算力，再根据全网算力设置一个合适的难度目标，让全网平均10分钟能出一个块。\n      4. 4. 比特币有个最长链原则，谁的区块链账本最长，就以谁的账本为准。制造区块需要进行大量计算，最长链实际就是凝聚着最大工作量的链。最长链也是最新的账本，记录着最多的账单。\n   3. 扩容与分叉\n      1\\. 比特币现金（Bitcoin Cash，BCH）的分叉在2017年8月1日出现，分叉后第一个开始区块为478559，而BCH 478559的区块大小约1.9MB，超过原有区块容量上限，意味着比特币现金的正式诞生，所有在分叉前的比特币持有者将自动拥有同金额的\"比特币现金\"区块链，区块容量上限立即提升至8MB。\n   4. 交易\n      1. 1. 比特币点对点网络将所有的交易历史都存储在区块链中，比特币交易就是在区块链账本上“记账”，通常它由比特币客户端协助完成。付款方需要以自己的私钥对交易进行数字签名，证明所有权并认可该次交易。比特币会被记录在收款方的地址上，交易无需收款方参与，收款方可以不在线，甚至不存在，交易的资金支付来源，也就是花费，称为“输入”，资金去向，也就是收入，称为“输出”。如有输入，输入必须大于等于输出，输入大于输出的部分即为交易手续费。 \n      2. 2. 矿工产出交易没有输入，只有输出，交易记录会显示新生成的比特币（Newly Generated Coins），除矿工产出交易外，一个输入必然是另一笔交易的一个输出。\n   5. 比特币分布公开\n      1\\. 比特币的所有交易都会被记录在区块链上，比特币最多的地址可以很轻易的在网络上公开查询。\n   6. 安全性\n      1. 1. 比特币结合P2P对等网络技术和密码学原理，来维持发行系统的安全可靠性。在P2P网络中无中心服务器，每个用户端既是一个节点，也有服务器的功能，任何一个节点都无法直接找到其他节点，必须依靠其户群进行信息交流。 \n      2. 2. 匿名与隐私保护\n         1. 匿名与隐私是比特币问世时主要的诉求，交易或创建比特币地址、钱包时，不需要提供任何个人信息，区块链也不会存储任何个人信息，但交易信息是向全网广播的，因此所有交易记录细节都是公开的、而可以追踪。\n         2. 由于比特币的交易纪录可以追踪，因此如果比特币的特定交易信息与关系的客户资料曝光，或经由KYC认证的交易所兑换成法定货币，其他相关地址也可能追踪出真实身份。\n7.

That’s how I complete my secret pathway.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1358/1\\*Z2vUzN0jgGoyrv4ghTVE9A.png)\n\nAll the tutorials are divided into 5 parts including **Connect to a Secret node with DataHub, Creating a secret account, Query the Secret Network, Sent the first transaction & Deploy the Smart contract. **I did not encounter any error while completing all five tutorials but the last 5th one tutorial took lots of time in installing the Dependencies. It took me 2hr approx to complete this secret pathway. That makes me lotta happy that now I have learned about a secret network. I’ll look forward to using the knowledge which I gain while learning about the secret network. It was a nice crowd cast event by the figment team with a secret network I watched till the end. If developers want to watch the crowd cast event with the secret network they should check out this link. <https://www.crowdcast.io/e/introducing-the-secret-network-learn-pathway/register>\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*x1fR1Huhjg_FNd4DAnKsaQ.png)\n\nI want to thanks the figment and secret network team for doing this collaboration.

Crypto networks offer a potential alternative as their consensus mechanisms reinforce trust within the rules of the network. As a result, crypto networks can be owned and operated by their respective communities of users and developers instead of centralized intermediaries.\n\n人与人之间的信任是很难扩大的（应该意指集聚，扩大，形成大规模），这种情况也就导致了（互联网）用户需要（依赖）中心化的，依靠数据收集的网络平台—如谷歌、脸书和推特。加密界的网络（应该就是指基于区块链技术的分布式记账多节点的permissionless网络）提供了一种潜在的替代方案，基于（这种情况可能实现）—即网络自身规则下的共识机制能加强信任。因此，加密界的各种网络能由它们各自的社区（包含用户和开发者）来所有（指控制把）和运转，而不是由中心化的第三方（来控制）\n\nThere are multiple approaches to achieving consensus within a crypto network. One popular method is to require miners in the network to execute every computation, otherwise known as Proof-of-Work (Pow). An alternative is for participants to select a group of delegates to execute computations, an effort commonly used in delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). Both approaches exhibit limitations in terms of scalability and robustness, respectively.\n\n在加密界网络中，有多种方法来实现共识。一种常见、流行的方法就是让网络中的矿工来执行各种运算，也就是工作量证明机制POW。（针对pow的）一种替代方案是，让参与者（指网络用户们）选出一组几个被委托的代表，来进行运算，称为委托的股权证明DPOS。两种方法分别在可扩展性（指pow）和坚固性（应该就是指安全性，对应dpos）方面表现出局限性。\n\nDFINITY is a project that is aiming to build a new internet backbone to support the next generation of trust-minimized applications and autonomous programs (i.e. smart contracts). As part of this effort, the project has proposed a new consensus model (an upgraded version of Proof-of-Stake (PoS)) that attempts “to strike the right balance” between mass computation (PoW) and vote delegation (DPoS). Like DPoS, the next DFINITY block is determined by a small subset of miners selected by the network. But, instead of a human selection process, the miner subset is determined by a random number generator that is built into the base protocol.\n\nThis random number generator (dubbed the “Random Beacon”) relies on cryptographic schemes, such as Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures, to ensure outputs cannot be predicted or exploited.\n\nDFINITY项目旨在，通过建立新的互联网支柱、根基、地基，来支持（帮助实现）下一代的最小化信任应用（dapp）和自治程序，即智能合约。（项目）力图（实现愿景）的一步，就是推出新的共识机制（升级版的pos），这种新的共识机制希望实现介于 大量运算（pow）和投票委托（dpos）之间的一种平衡。和DPoS一样，DFINITY网络新区块的产生，由一小部分DFINITY网络选定的矿工实现。但是，这不是一种人为选择的过程（指如何选定有挖矿权的矿工），而是由内置在DFINITY协议上的 随机数生成器决定。这个随机数生成器（被称为“随机信标”）基于加密学方法来确保（随机数）输出不能被预测或操控，（加密学方法）如Boneh Lynn Shacham（BLS）签名方法。\n\nThe delegation of computation responsibilities to a small group of miners theoretically improves network performance by reducing both execution costs and transaction latency. Moreover, the removal of a human voting process may eliminate the common problems seen in PoS or DPoS models, like voter manipulation (i.e. cartels) or low voter participation.\n\n把运算职责委派给以小组矿空的方法，理论上能提高网络性能，即通过降低执行成本和事务（交易、链上各种需要算力的行为）延迟来实现。而且，去除了人工投票流程，有可能消除那些在PoS或DPoS机制中常见的问题，如投票操纵（卡特尔。指较大机构、团体联合，克服集体行动困境实现目的）或低投票率（用户参与积极性不高）。\n\n原文请见：Oct 5, 2019\n\n[https://messari.io/article/research-dfinity-a16z](https://messari.io/article/research-dfinity-a16z)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654316785, "digest": "MD_0vuKXFl7zg5SuE1c5_5j7s3LibmdrtXhpqwYKQOY", "contributor": "0x758eFca2FC489DF9AC11F46153953a78d37C08a9"}

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NsBfYEx4o_iNmqoe27Y0-.jpg?height=320&width=800)\n\n我曾经干过一级股权市场卖方FA，目前又在干买方VC，在这个书评中，我想以一个从业者的角度，谈谈这个骗局为何发生，以及我从中得到工作中的启迪。\n\n## 一、美元基金的产业链结构提供了骗局的温床\n\n曾经和某顶级的美元基金的朋友交流，他告诉我，基金的打法是「不错过」，即宁可投错，宁可投贵，但不能错过任何新兴的巨型公司（百亿美金以上估值）。宁可投错的意思是，无论是ARVR、无人驾驶、区块链，只要有可能诞生巨型公司的行业，必须去学习和布局。宁可投贵的意思是，A轮投不进就B轮投，B轮投不进就CD轮投，总之无论如何也要坐上头部企业的列车。\n\n这个做法看上去有点傻，所以很多人以瑞幸咖啡、拼多多、摩拜单车举例，来论述美元基金是「傻钱」，篇篇10万+阅读引发民众高潮，而美元基金中最聪明的脑袋却乐此不彼地继续下注。\n\n在我职业生涯初期是完全不能理解这种做法的，但当我对巨型企业的高估值——十亿美金、百亿美金、千亿美金的差别有了更深的感受后，我逐渐能够理解这些美元基金的做法。\n\n最新（截至2019年12月）全美上市市值排名前30名的公司总市值达到12.54万亿美元，是A股3700多家公司总市值的1.5倍，其中两家公司（苹果和微软）的市值超过一万亿美元，第30名康卡斯特（COMCAST）的市值也越过了2000亿美元。尤其惊人的是，这么一组巨型公司群体，过去十年的平均ROE达到了19.6%。如果十年前投资它们，投资的年复合收益率达到了16.08%，远超同期标普500指数的年收益率（11.1%）。\n\n苹果公司的市值是万亿美金，意味着投资1000家十亿美金估值的独角兽，只要能出1家苹果，就赚钱了。今日头条的市值是千亿美金，意味着投资100家独角兽，只要能出1家今日头条，就赚钱了。苹果和头条的估值当然不是虚高，苹果在二级市场已经公开交易定价，今日头条2019年收入千亿人民币以上且维系2位数增速，估值基本得到市场认可。\n\n这意味着什么？独角兽是指十亿美金以上估值且未上市的科技企业，基本上是家喻户晓，《2019胡润全球独角兽榜》显示，全球独角兽共500家，中国共200家。这些商业模式已经验证并成为赛道潜在赢家的企业，还能有如此高的投资容错率（1/1000或1/100），其实是很合算的投资标的。如果后期美元基金的资金足够多（这几家相信大家都知道），多到能对每一家潜在独角兽下注，最后应当能长期取得不错的回报。\n\n后期美元基金「不错过」的打法，也深刻地影响了早期美元基金的构成。下图是一个会议中分享某VC过去24年的业绩，如果猜到了名字可以在评论区留言。会议台下的我，受到了强烈的震撼，这个基金每年都在投资，然而在整整24年中真正的回报只出现过4次，也就意味着剩余的接近20年，这个基金都是血本无归的。这也就意味着，LP如果只投资这个管理团队的1只基金，很有可能血本无归，只有忍受亏损持续在每一期基金下注，才能获得最后的回报。\n\n在硅谷，这样的早期美元基金并不罕见，这也就形成了早期美元基金和人民币基金最大的不同点：早期美元基金只追求「大而不确定的蛋糕」，对「小而确定的蛋糕」毫无兴趣，认为是浪费时间。「大」到百亿美金以上，「不确定」到可以忍受创始人欺骗、犯罪……\n\n我相信，高智商的伊丽莎白从19岁斯坦福退学创业到31岁身家45亿美元，中间的10年间她不断学习，她对这种玩法一定比我理解深刻得多。早期的投资人和董事会成员更是这种玩法的专家，他们真的完全不知道公司的情况吗？我想也未必，但已经被绑上战车的他们也只能唱多，没得选啊。\n\n我看完书后一直在反思一个问题：为什么风险投资行业几十年，今天才出现这样的大骗局？我的两个猜想如下：\n\n* 随着行业的发展，资产端（创业者）扩张带来更聪明的人出来创业，资金端（投资人）扩张带来更外行的人进行投资，最狡猾的创业者恰好遇到最外行的投资人，悲剧就发生了；\n* 过去全球经济处于增量时代，只要有足够多的钱提供供给（如补贴）就能占据市场需求，而如今经济存量博弈时代，各个行业都性需要面临巨头的竞争，不再是有钱就能打天下了。\n\n## 二、从4类受害者的角度反思创业与投资\n\n第二部分，我想谈谈在希拉洛斯Theranos事件中的4类受害者，包括：大企业客户、早期投资人、后轮投资人、创业者自己，以反思创业与投资。\n\n### （一）大企业客户\n\n* **事实**\n\n> 沃尔格林是一家连锁药店，害怕竞争对手率先使用希拉洛斯Theranos的产品，在明知产品可能存在缺陷的情况下进行了大规模的应用。在《坏血》中是这样描述的：\n>\n> 结束会议之后，亨特把雷纳特·范登霍夫叫到一边，他是沃尔格林一方负责试点项目的人。亨特告诉他，刚刚的事情不太对劲。警报正在不断累积。首先，伊丽莎白拒绝让他进入实验室。然后，她拒绝了把沃尔格林的人放在帕洛阿尔托的提议。而现在，她又拒绝做一个简单的比较研究。…… “我们不能要求这个，”他说，“我们不能冒风险让CVS与他们在六个月内达成交易，那是真有可能的。” …… 沃尔格林的竞争对手CVS的总部位于罗德岛，按收入来说比沃尔格林的规模高出三分之一，两者之间的竞争确实令连锁药店行业的一切变得多姿多彩。亨特作为一位外来者，一个不是沃尔格林公司一员的人，很难理解这样一种狭隘的世界观。希拉洛斯聪明地利用了这种不安感。结果，沃尔格林患上了严重的错失恐惧症。\n\n* **分析**\n\n全市场供给过剩，逐步从增量时代转向存量时代。大企业一方面竞争加剧毛利下降，另一方面发展停滞后，内部被掩盖问题逐渐暴露需要解决。大企业的管理层习惯了高增速很难回到低增速，否则难以给股东和员工交代，只能焦虑地寻找办法。为了维系不可能的高增速，越是让人难以理解的科技或概念越容易成为「解药」，大企业的管理层很容易自我说服陷入fear of missing out，最终损失金钱或名誉。\n\n* **反思**\n\n要尊重经济的客观发展规律，并不是每一个产业在这个时代都能有高增速，应当理性看待并对于不同行业制定「稳」「通」「转」的战略。当然应当拥抱创新，但应当多反问自己，企业是否有用于创新的盈余资金？企业是选择创新开拓者还是创新跟随者？实操中是否通过产业基金来实现财务和声誉风险的控制？\n\n### （二）早期投资人\n\n* **事实**\n\n> 唐纳德·L·卢卡斯（Don Lucas），简称唐，参与了希拉洛斯大约4亿美元估值的B轮投资；唐纳德·A·卢卡斯（Don Lucas），是老唐的儿子，简称小唐，在父亲退休后，2009年建立了卢卡斯风险投资集团，并带了数十位LP设立专项基金，参与了希拉洛斯大约60亿美元估值的投资。在《坏血》中是这样描述的：\n>\n> 艾维注意到，唐对伊丽莎白有多么溺爱。这个老人把她看成孙女一样。唐一头白发，是个身材肥胖、喜欢戴宽边帽的绅士，他已过了75岁，属于更老一代的风险投资家，这一代人把风险投资当成私人俱乐部一般。他曾经把拉里·埃里森培养成一个著名的创业家。看到伊丽莎白，显然他觉得自己又发现了另一个。…… 几个星期后，2013年9月9日下午，迈克收到小唐发来的一封电子邮件，标题是“希拉洛斯——时间紧急”，其中包含了更多细节。邮件发给迈克这样以前投资过小唐的基金的人，提供了《华尔街日报》那篇文章的链接，还有那天早晨希拉洛斯的新闻稿的链接。邮件说，卢卡斯风险投资集团获得“邀请”，投资希拉洛斯公司的额度最高可达1500万美元。按照伊丽莎白提供给卢卡斯公司的折扣价格，给希拉洛斯的估值是60亿美元。\n\n* **分析**\n\n从金钱上，早期投资人的亏损不能算作错误，毕竟他们投资的时间点本就是产品没有验证，仅仅有团队和想法的阶段。早期投资人犯的错误在于，后续无止境地给伊丽莎白背书并参与忽悠后轮投资人，损害了自己的名誉。\n\n* **反思**\n\n2015年我刚入行时，曾经有一位国内的天使投资人和我说「如何界定一笔投资的成功？我认为融到下轮就算成功了，要想从天使轮看到公司全生命周期直到上市，实在太难了。」\n\n另一件事情，是我研究供应链行业时问一个早期美元基金的同行「公司的资金利用效率再高，融这点钱也很难取得规模效应」，对方回应我说「这个问题太新颖了，我从来没有考虑过这个问题，公司增速够快的话，一定能融到下一轮。」\n\n第一个故事中，后一句话我非常认可，从天使轮看清楚公司全生命周期实在太困难了。但我不认为这能够说明融到下轮就算成功，还有另一种假设——天使投资是一定历史阶段的产物，投资行业会长期存在，而天使投资未必长期存在。而第二个故事让我反思，天使投资一定程度很依赖后轮投资人的打法，一旦后轮投资人思路和偏好改变，天使投资不随之改变就会颗粒无收。\n\n虽然我无法列举出具体的数字，即便出于直观感受，我也很确信中国的早期投资人中破产的不在少数。我反思，如果早期投资机构能明确被投企业未来的融资方向是人民币还是美元，并根据后轮投资人的偏好变化及时调整打法，也许胜率会大得多。\n\n比如，以投资于中国市场的中后期人民币基金为例，他们更看重符合A股上市标准的，能够在细分品类构建壁垒的「核心资产」。早期投资人也许就可以挖掘头部消费电子行业的上游供应商，找到小而美的标的；通过挖掘SAP等公司高管离职创业，把握中国软件升级浪潮带来的机会……\n\n### （三）后轮投资人\n\n* **事实**\n\n> 伙伴基金和传媒大佬默多克参与了90亿美金的最后轮次的投资，仅仅2年后，该笔投资就被证明失败，伙伴基金也发起诉讼。在《坏血》中是这样描述的：\n>\n> 2014年2月4日，伙伴基金以每股17美元的价格，购买了5655294股希拉洛斯公司的股份，比四个月前卢卡斯风险投资集团付出的价格多了2美元/股。这笔投资令希拉洛斯将9600万美元收入囊中，自身的估值达到了惊人的90亿美元。这意味着拥有公司一半多一点股份的伊丽莎白，现在的净财富几乎接近50亿美元。…… 希拉洛斯是默多克在他所控制的媒体资产以外所做的最大单笔投资……她给出的投资文件中，预测2015年的收入为10亿美元，利润3.3亿美元；2016年的收入预测为20亿美元，利润5.05亿美元。这些数字让目前100亿美元的估值显得很便宜。…… 希拉洛斯给默多克列出的其他有声望的投资者也让他感到宽心。其中包括考克斯企业（Cox Enterprises），该公司总部位于亚特兰大，是一个家族集团公司，其总裁吉姆·肯尼迪跟默多克关系很好，还有沃尔玛公司的沃顿家族。其他大名鼎鼎但他并不了解的投资者，包括新英格兰爱国者队（New England Patriots）的老板鲍勃·克拉夫特（Bob Kraft）、墨西哥亿万富翁卡洛斯·斯利姆（Carlos Slim）以及控制着菲亚特·克莱斯勒汽车集团的意大利工业家约翰·艾尔坎（John Elkann）。…… 2016年，伙伴基金向特拉华州衡平法院（Delaware’s Court of Chancery）起诉霍姆斯、巴尔瓦尼和公司，指控他们以“一系列的谎言、重大虚假陈述和错漏”欺骗自己。\n\n* **分析**\n\n我无法猜测后轮投资人犯下的所有错误，但他们至少犯了两个错。\n\n第一个错误是，对财务和业务的勾稽关系模糊化了。希拉洛斯对外宣传1滴血测验，实际拿回实验室用专业设备测验。实验室测验或许能给公司带来一些营收，但这和公司想要达到的愿景是两码事。回想起前两年B2B狂热时，市场也出现过按GMV定估值的错误，事实上B2B企业的GMV中，有的是自营贸易，有的是提供垫资功能的代理采购，有的只是走一道流水，是完全无法放在一起论述的。\n\n第二个错误是，过于相信其他投资人的判断。这个错误在中国的股权投资市场也屡见不鲜，往往一个知名的领投方冲在前面，可以带来一堆小基金的跟投。\n\n* **反思**\n\n我一直非常谨慎地处理财务和业务的勾稽关系，对于传统业务和我们真正下注的高科技业务的财务数据一定会拆开来分析。但我深知，同行们的分析能力都不比我差，之所以将传统业务的营收混杂在高科技业务中一起进行估值，仅仅只是为了支撑估值的合理性，给投委会和LP一个交代。其实最大的敌人来自内部，GP和LP利益不完全一致，投资经理和合伙人的利益也不完全一致，这里又涉及到一个很大的话题「风险投资行业的代理人问题」，不展开了。这个问题事实上是基本无解的，建立正确的流程、激励和文化并不完全有效，好在风险投资行业并不需要很多人，因此可以雇佣足够好的人、足够对的人、犯错成本足够高的人，一定程度上可以缓解。\n\n关于第二个错误，我自己的解决方法是，有选择地相信间接证据，一旦下注过大就必须要有直接证据。\n\n比如，领投方是专长于PreIPO的机构，我就会相信财务尽调和IPO可能性的审核不会有太大问题，但行业趋势需要自己分析；领投方是行业专长的基金，就可以相信他们对于技术或是行业趋势的判断，但是尽调必须自己做仔细。对于前轮投资人的观点，一律视作卖方投行的观点，可以参考但不可相信，毕竟屁股决定脑袋。对于唐纳德那种前轮投资人又领投后轮投资的，务必再三告诫自己，他的综合成本比我低得多，他的投资可能另有动机。\n\n对于所有没有直接证据的跟投机会，严格控制我方出资在本轮融资中的占比，同时控制我方本轮投资低于我方平均单笔下注额。\n\n### （四）创业者自己\n\n* **事实**\n\n> 在《坏血》中是这样描述的：\n>\n> 如果罪名成立，霍姆斯和巴尔瓦尼面临最高可达二十年的监禁。两人均辩称无罪。截止本文写作之时，由于证据开示程序的耽搁，开庭日期尚未确定。目前，联邦检察官已经移交了存有大约1600万页证据的保密硬盘。至于希拉洛斯，该公司于2018年9月资金耗尽，遭到解散。\n\n* **分析**\n\n在2019年底，我读这本书的前1个月，又一个创业者自杀了，朋友圈都在为创业者愤愤不平。我的一条回复是：「商业是等价交换的，想要赚到超额的财富绝不是靠努力就足够的。一般的努力对应贫穷的生活，拼命的努力对应一般的生活，想要获得超额财富必须在拼命努力的基础上承担额外的风险，包括失去健康、失去财富、失去自由、失去名誉。每个潜在创业者都应取决于自己的人生目标，来决定是否参与这场豪赌。」\n\n我相信，伊丽莎白并不是一个想把融资款据为己有的骗子，她只是一个用投资人的钱赌方向的赌徒罢了——用其他人的钱赌方向，是年轻人重要的暴富方法。这场赌局对创始人实际上是优渥的，受到不公平对待的是风险投资人，或是风险投资人背后的LP。\n\n* **反思**\n\n一部分投资人已经察觉到此类问题并加以防范，大学生或初级互联网人的创业已基本无法得到资金支持，即便是希拉洛斯也并没有获得特别多主流基金的支持。我把这个现象归纳为一句话：可以支持成功人士用大钱赚大钱的创业，也可以支持非成功人士用小钱赚大钱的创业，但绝不能支持非成功人士用大钱赚大钱的创业。\n\n特斯拉的马斯克之所以能够募到大钱，不完全因为他的「忽悠」能力，更因为他在PayPal帮投资人赚了不少钱；蔚来汽车的李斌之所以能够募到大钱，也不完全因为他长袖善舞，更因为他的易车和易鑫帮投资人赚了大钱——这些都是成功人士用大钱赚大钱的创业。而他们的第一次创业，无论是PayPal还是易车，都是用小钱赚大钱的创业。\n\n反过来，乐视、OFO、锤子都是典型的失败案例，创始人没有成功创业经验也没有财富积累，仅仅依靠「忽悠」投资人的钱来赌方向。除了这些已死去的企业，还有远远不止的企业顶着高估值却没有流动性，创业者和投资人一起维系着纸面浮盈。\n\n银行的朋友和我提到对公业务的风控中有一个词，叫作「违约成本」，用在这里极合适。在商业模式尚未被验证的阶段，投资人以真金白银下注，创始人又下注了什么呢？要么是过去功成名就赚取的财富，要么是作为大科学家积累的无形资产，仅靠一张斯坦福的学历可能分量还不够……\n\n希拉洛斯的故事，不应该再发生。",

{"id": "41PBN5BIyDXJ-dV0HgOTp2s-_nFkNF-Op7_IRHoxSfM", "title": "A Letter to my Anti-NFT Friends", "body": "Dear beloved friend, \n\nToday you asked me many good questions expressing your doubt about NFTs. After an hour-long discussion, my answer is far from sufficient to convince you, but I decided to gather my thoughts more thoroughly and hand you a written record to laugh at me 10 years later, or I hope by that time you already embraced this new space and we can laugh together :D\n\nFirst, you raised a very key question, what exactly is NFT? You heard on the news that it involves copyrights and identity authentication, but is there anything more than that? This is a hard question even for early adopters in the space, as this is such a young industry that some of the best usages of NFTs have not been invented yet. I can only summarize from my limited experience that NFTs currently have the following 3 usages:\n\n* Intellectual Property. Think of Disney movies or songs on Spotify. IPs are valuable as the room for imagination is boundaryless, thus the monetary value should also reflect that, right? Unfortunately, it’s not the case in real life. Creators struggle to defend their own IPs, some don’t even get the chance to turn their work into IPs. NFTs solve the creator economy problem by taking away the middleman, bridging creators and their audience directly, and creating a steady income stream through royalty fees. NFT can also form connections with physical properties, as we already have real estate properties listed on Opensea as an NFT.\n* Access Pass. Examples include conference admission or club membership. Human beings are social animals and we are constantly in search of interest groups. You asked why we still need another proof system while we already have QR codes and physical membership cards? My answer to that is it’s all about efficiency and scalability. Access pass in the form of NFTs can aggregate those groups in a single wallet and unlock future benefits in the form of airdrops. Instead of going to a hundred websites with different usernames and passwords, and submitting your credit card information separately, you could do it all with two clicks in your wallet. \n* Crowd-funding for Startups. The prior two are from users’ standpoints. You asked me if I would start my own NFT collection, what would I tell my investors what it is about? And as a stereotypical consultant, I am going to give you the never-can-go-wrong answer: it depends. Every NFT has a builder team behind it, and they are not much different from startups. The only difference is that instead of begging traditional Venture Capital firms, the founding team can now engage directly with retail investors.\n\nFrom a technical security standpoint, is it too risky to use NFT? What if there is something wrong with the blockchain? You hit the nail on the head, my friend. The whole point of inventing blockchain, this massive distributed database system, is to reduce the single vendor reliance problem. Think of all the human tragedies in history, dictatorship, Chornobyl disaster, Enron scandal, Facebook data leakage. What do they have in common? Single point of control and lack of transparency. Blockchain solves those two problems at once with a trustless system, as long as there is one miner in the world to verify the transactions, the blockchain will continue to exist and the data are on chain, publicly accessible to anyone. There are certainly vulnerabilities in the code, but whiteheads will continue to have incentives to fix bugs, and this living system will evolve at a much faster pace than any single company/government entity on earth, as the code is open sourced. \n\nAfter getting some basic understanding of what NFTs can do, why it has to live on the blockchain, you went on and raised your concern. Bored Apes worth the same price as a house makes you nervous, how could such a profitable return sustain itself? With all of the public sentiment, overdue government regulation, and memory from the internet bubble, isn’t NFT just another make-rich quick scheme? And even if there is some room for play here, the old/big/smart money must already have their skin in the game, how can normal people with a day job like you and me compete with those institutions? \n\nThose are all valid concerns. And the lazy answer to address them all is this: we are still early. The whole NFT market cap is roughly $800M as of March 2022 based on Opensea trading volume. For comparison, a single luxury goods brand like LVMH is worth $325B, 400 times bigger, and it’s highly likely by the time the next generation of kids grew up, they will view NFTs as the new luxury brands. Those kids were born into an era where their parents are preparing generation wealth in crypto form for them, their peers are well-exposed to the latest NFT trends on Tiktok, and they are just one purchase away from being in the same NFT group with their favorite stars such as Justin Bieber. By the time they have consumer power, NFTs will likely be the most popular presents among youngsters. The road is not always straight and we might experience multiple bubble burst moments, schemes, and bear markets, but by the time we come out, the market will gain exponential growth compared to where we are today. \n\nWe retail investors may not have the same level of leverage and capital, but we are more agile than those too-big-to-fail institutions. A public company like Tesla needs to go through many legal hassles and politics to include Bitcoin in its financial statement. The innovator’s dilemma will trap those traditional financial institutions until they have to react to market change. We don’t have to wait. Needless to say in a blue ocean market, it is not a zero-sum game, the pie is literally so big that you have to invite people to come and eat it, and that’s exactly why I wrote this article. There will be more government regulations, but it’s not a bad thing as regulation is necessary for mass adoption. Don’t fight the waves, join the tides and ride with them together. \n\nI will see you down the rabbit hole, on the other side.\n\nLove,\n\nCocoa", "timestamp": 1654317784, "digest": "w87eqBDQZCXf5E1VnO5qXapD6wIjwud52P50bT7HS20", "contributor": "0x4c79303747d47d01112d91C20CB9685c44112896"}

We want to create a community for people who love anime and games.\n2. KONG and KONG communities will continue to operate in phases. Phase 1 will release 10,000 Masked Hunter PFP, mint price will be set at 0.01-0.02ETH.\n3. KONG is a CC0 project for all communities and web3 members.\n4. The community will be the highest priority of the KONG project. The core founding team pursues the essence of web3 and insists on transparency and openness.\n\n### Vision\n\nWe want to create a community for people who love anime and games, and we will build our unique culture and brand based on the community.\n\nWe will open all copyrights for community members or others to participate in co-construction, and the core founding team will continue to explore more interesting directions and areas for the project in different phases.\n\n* Phase 1 (now): Produce and release 10,000 Masked Hunter anime PFP (inspired by \"Kaitou Kiddo\" and \"Persona 5\"), the sales proceeds will be used for the recruitment and training of the community management team. At the same time, we hope to buy the sandbox land and develop application scenarios (games/online gatherings, etc.) that can be used by the community.\n* Phase 2: The main goal of this phase is to strengthen community culture and enhance community influence. The community interactive co-creation model will be opened, that is, community members can vote to join different camps, and the team founders will lead different camps to hold weekly confrontation activities (online singing/online Texas/online competition, etc.) The story background, cultural/brand derivatives, airdrops, etc. of the KONG project will be determined by the weekly confrontation results of each camp, and the founding team will also consider further adapting it into novels, comics and even games.

{"id": "-qIeB7io0MAzQjmSyj5iN44MUQoEv3Xmyxgk_YDR7GY", "title": "Aptos新公链介绍", "body": "## 背景\n\n从广义上讲，有两种方法可以考虑扩展区块链：将它们分解成更小的部分并尝试将它们连接起来，或者优化和扩展单个分片。\n\nRollup 和分片是将区块链分解成更小的部分的主要例子。这些方法产生了几个二阶问题：\n1、他们打破可组合性\n2、它们增加了延迟\n3、它们增加了开发人员的技术复杂性\n4、它们增加了许多不协调的开发者之间的社会协调成本\n5、它们制作的跨链应用程序天生脆弱\n\n另一种方法是优化和扩展单个分片。这种方法的最大问题是，在固定的时间点，整体系统性能必须有一定的上限（但是，硬件继续变得更快）。\n\n加密行业以相对二元的方式构建了这场辩论。但有细微差别。这些方法并不相互排斥。尽管业内大多数人传统上都主张将状态分解为多个部分，但我们主张优化单分片性能以优化 UX、DX 并最大化可组合加密应用程序的设计空间。这种信念使我们在 2019 年和 2020 年期间对 Solana 进行了三次投资，并在 2021 年迅速崛起。这导致我们进入 Aptos。\n\n## 项目介绍\n\n曾在 Meta 的 Libra/Diem 和 Calibra/Novi 担任主要构建者的 Mo Shaikh 与 Avery Ching 在 Diem 项目被阻止后没有放弃原有的工作，而是选择了从 Meta 离职，并聚集 Diem 和 Novi 核心开发人员组建了 Aptos 团队。所以该项目虽为新项目却拥有成熟的团队和已有的技术，并且为了保证项目的独立性等问题，该团队并未从前东家 Meta 处融资，甚至包括 Meta 的领导们。按照其官方说法：「自从离开 Meta（前身为 Facebook）以来，我们已经能够将我们的想法付诸实践，摒弃官僚主义的繁文缛节，并从头开始建立一个全新的网络，将它们付诸实践。我们现在准备更广泛地宣传这些想法，并开始交付我们一直在完善的基础设施。\n\nAptos 将部分建立在我们在过去三年中公开开发的技术之上。Aptos 使用的是最初为 Diem 开发的安全可靠的语言 Move。我们当时构想的想法仍然适用，并将作为安全、可扩展、可升级的 Web3 的重要基础。我们的去中心化和无许可访问计划进展迅速，并将在公开场合进行。\n\nAptos Labs 正在构建一种新的第 1 层区块链，专注于安全性、可扩展性和可升级性。该团队由 Mo Shaikh 与 Avery Ching 领导，他们是 Meta 的 Libra/Diem 和 Calibra/Novi 的两位主要构建者。不幸的是，Diem 被阻止启动，这使他们的工作无法看到曙光。Mo 和 Avery 没有放弃多年的工作，而是离开了 Meta，在开源的 Diem 代码库的基础上建立了一个名为 Aptos 的新网络（它恰如其分的意思是「人民」）。离开 Meta 后，Mo 和 Avery 以及许多 Diem 和 Novi 核心开发人员聚集在一起，组成了加密领域最令人印象深刻的团队之一。\n\n## 愿景\n\n当前有许多智能合约平台部署在生产环境中——每个平台都有自己独特的优势和权衡。Aptos 相信，需要一个快速创新和适应性强的区块链来满足当今和未来数十亿人的需求。其信念是，用户体验需要在安全性和可扩展性方面得到显着改善，才能接触到大众（尤其是非加密原生用户）。因此在过去三年中，团队着手研究和开发创新理念并将它们安全地部署到生产环境中。\n\n## 技术特点\n\n**1、采用安全灵活的区块链语言-MOVE 语言：**\n\nMove 语言专为在区块链上进行安全资源管理和可验证执行而设计。事务执行是确定性的、封闭的和计量的。确定性和封闭性意味着交易执行的输出是完全可预测的，并且仅基于交易中包含的信息和当前分类账状态。计量是在事务执行级别抵御拒绝服务攻击的重要防御措施。移动证明者可以通过表达性规范语言正式验证 Move 模块的属性，并且速度足够快，且作为持续集成测试的一部分运行。移动资源，受线性类型启发，静态确保资源得到保存，不会被复制或意外破坏——完全避免了一整类潜在的攻击。\n\n**2、拥有生产级、高保证 BFT 共识协议：**\n\nAptos 的团队开发了生产级、低延迟拜占庭容错 (BFT) 引擎。在过去三年中，团队已经实施了协议的第四次迭代，并在私有主网环境中升级了共识协议，该环境具有多样化的运营商和零停机时间。对 BFT 协议的第一个实现添加了一个主动起搏器，它使用超时来同步验证器，这比等待增加的超时要快得多。随着对协议的最新改进，区块只需两次网络往返即可提交，从而使亚秒级的最终确定性成为常见情况。Aptos 新颖的声誉系统分析链上状态并自动更新领导者轮换以在没有任何人为干预的情况下调整无响应的验证者，使其非常适合去中心化环境。此外，协议清楚地将活性与安全区分开来。无论网络不可达或非安全核心以某种方式受到损害，只要 BFT 诚实保证得到维护，链就不会分叉。共识协议的安全性已经过审计和正式验证。\n\n**3、更安全的账户密钥恢复和轮换协议：**\n\n​\t为了防止密钥被盗，Aptos 支持任何账户轮换其私钥的能力。验证者还可以定期轮换他们的共识密钥，以提高安全性。为了避免数十亿美元的价值因密钥丢失而被锁定的问题，我们还致力于开发可直接集成到区块链账户模型中的密钥恢复新技术。\n\n**4、多代理交易功能：**\n\n​\t多代理交易利用 Move 的签名者类型，允许在单个交易中跨多个链上账户进行任意数量的原子操作。这可以使原子交换、K-of-N 批准以及两个或多个链上实体之间的任意原子操作在单个事务中完成。使这些复杂的交互不可分割可以提高安全性和性能。将多代理交易与多签名支持结合在一个帐户中时，可以实现更广泛的可组合模式和用例。\n\n**5、可升级性：**\n\n​\tAptos 区块链可作为关键资产进行升级，并在过去几年中成功执行了几次重大升级而没有停机。为了实现这一目标，验证者的管理和配置通过链上状态进行管理——方便社区投票和快速执行升级。\n\n## 投资者\n\n我很高兴地宣布 Multicoin Capital 参与了 Aptos Labs 2 亿美元的战略融资。本轮融资由 a16z crypto 领投，参与方包括 Katie Haun 的基金、Three Arrows Capital、ParaFi Capital、IronGrey、Hashed、Variant、Tiger Global、BlockTower、FTX Ventures、Paxos、Coinbase Ventures 等。\n\n​3 月 29 日，Binance Labs 宣布战略投资公链项目 Aptos 开发团队 Aptos Labs，将与 Aptos 在开发、代码审查、基础设施建设和黑客马拉松方面进行密切合作。\n\n## Multicoin Capital 投资的加密货币\n\nMulticoin Capital 投资涵盖区块链的各个赛道，投资于突破计算机科学和技术界限的技术努力、支持全球范围内信任最小化计算的基础设施，以及需要信任最小化属性的消费者和企业应用程序。按照类别分类包括基础设施层面、L1、L2、企业向、隐私、身份、移动端等，投资项目众多，本文仅罗列几个行业知名项目，其余项目可自行从其管网查阅。\n\n* Coin98 是一个一体化的 DeFi 平台，为一整套产品提供支持，包括 Coin98 钱包、Coin98 交易所和 Space Gate（跨链桥）。Coin98 旨在满足行业未开发的需求，成为将 TradFi 用户连接到任何 DeFi 服务或区块链的首选网关\n* Near 是 NEAR 协议的创建者。NEAR 协议由经验丰富的有竞争力的程序员团队设计和开发，通过使用一种新颖的分片方法和称为 Nightshade 的共识机制实现了全球规模。NEAR 为应用程序提供可预测的成本，并在协议级别为开发人员提供卓越的工具\n* Solana 是一个去中心化的区块链，旨在为全世界提供可扩展、用户友好的应用程序。Solana 是世界上最快的区块链之一，也是加密领域发展最快的生态系统，拥有超过 400 个项目，涵盖 DeFi、NFT、Web3 等\n* SKALE 的弹性侧链提供标准全容量侧链的所有优势以及真正去中心化网络的安全保证。弹性侧链具有高性能、可配置且与 Ethereum / Web3 兼容\n* Torus 帮助用户使用他们的 OAuth 账户登录 DApp，例如使用 Google 和 Facebook Connect 登录。Torus 使用分布式密钥生成 (DKG)，这是一种新的密钥管理方法，适用于所有浏览器和设备，并且包括无缝账户恢复，而无需引入任何新的信任假设\n* Keep 是私有数据的链下容器。Keeps 帮助合约利用公共区块链的全部力量，实现与私有数据的深度交互。Keeps 在公共区块链世界和私有数据之间架起了一座桥梁。它为区块链开发人员带来了新一波的基础创新\n\n除上述项目外，还包括跨链 DeFi 产品的生态系统 Alpha Finance Lab、区块链协议 Arweave、数字流媒体服务 Audius 等等，已经尚未公布在其官网投资列表中的项目，在此不一一列举。下面将重点讲述其专注于安全性、可扩展性、可升级性的一层区块链项目——Aptos。", "timestamp": 1654319249, "digest": "kitgYyboyrb7ULrKNV727iTKTlunNbKLNtgVIf898QE", "contributor": "0xdd0255D570cCD28980C9d41f99Fb9D40e47A7D05"}

{"id": "nTnPjjkivMFTaAyCx_leeYGst9j6eLwJDtqCDBoRqm4", "title": "Moland Defense｜Mobox 的塔防游戏体验及实测攻略", "body": "MOBOX是GMA一直深度参与的项目，现其中的游戏已经推出了金币大师，区块战争，ChainZ Arena等游戏，Moland Defense塔防游戏是在4月11日正式推出的新游戏，也是目前mobox里面较为火热的一款，现在进行到了第四个赛季，每两周为一个赛季。\n\n先提下塔防游戏中玩家最关心的一些问题：回本周期，入场成本，盈利情况等等。因为塔防也属于一款养成类游戏，在目前币价市场行情来看，入场成本相对于之前币价高位要少一半左右，我们自己的账户回本周期要半年左右，在榜单的100名左右。\n\n现在按照mbox代币的投入，mbox代币的一次性回本概率20%-50%（其中包含遗迹抽奖+钥匙抽奖+入场第一赛季榜单奖励），后续卡片升级也是需要水晶的消费，需要花费的水晶成本也是很大的，如果不是长期玩家，不太建议玩。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fM8r_ypYmjF8D90eAfJQJ.png?height=313&width=853)\n\n# 一.项目亮点及风险提示\n\n**亮点：**\n\n1\\.比起MOBOX平台之前推出的几款游戏，有了一定的可玩性。\n\n2\\.时间花费还可以，每天大概花半个小时左右，不是很长。\n\n3\\.玩法中有一点类似矿机和cz比较像，遗迹中大转盘类似于矿机，钥匙宝箱抽mobox的方式可一次性回本15%-40%。\n\n**风险提示：**\n\n1\\.这仍然是一个氪金的游戏，如果想冲一个好的排名或者获得收益，在后期的赛季还是需要不断充钱并且复投进去。\n\n2\\.散户不建议玩，亏钱的风险较大。\n\n# 二.游戏内经济线介绍（抽奖+P2E）\n\n玩法介绍会分为抽奖和P2E这两个部分，说明下游戏中的两条经济线，也是两种主要的收益来源。在这个部分，文章中会按照玩家投入1w个mbox代币来举例测算。\n\n**抽奖：（每日遗迹抽奖3次）**\n\n投入1万个mobox可以达到7级，每天可以进行3次大转盘抽奖，可抽到的奖励如图六选一，按照最低计算可抽到15个mobox/天，则一个赛季（14天）约收益210个mobox。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oU94UbgmbxGnXcU_FiW9J.png?height=143&width=561)\n\n**抽奖：（密钥抽奖）**\n\n投入1万个mobox，可以最少获得钥匙1000个，可以在通关摇摇乐抽宝箱，按照第26章的宝箱的规则：可以抽到（1400-4200mbox），运气较好的玩家可以一次性回本40%。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IhCg82KkYhsyixKZJZ_g8.png?height=535&width=586)\n\n综上两种抽奖方式，都是按照消费达成的等级来决定的，遗迹的大转盘抽奖是长期抽奖，每日进行，而钥匙抽宝箱可看作是一次性投入后官方给予的补贴，这个部分的抽奖概率随机性大，根据我们测试的结果一次性大概能回25%左右，大概取个中间值（不包含水晶投入）。\n\n**P2E部分**\n\n游戏中的收益主要来自登上榜单后获得mobox和水晶。\n\n榜单共有三个，分别是：竞技榜，英雄榜，关卡榜。\n\n竞技榜：玩家按照掠夺的积分进行排榜，积分越高，奖励越多\n\n英雄榜：通过抽卡之后按照获得的卡片品质获得积分，根据积分数量排榜\n\n关卡榜：按照通关的前后顺序排榜\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vkh3vvwSfgrc-Imp9OsI8.png?height=1210&width=724)\n\n以上的回本情况根据我们投入的8k个mobox来看大约每个赛季可以回本10%左右，因为额外还会每个赛季消耗水晶进行英雄的升级，这部分的消耗非常大。\n\n# 三.游戏攻略\n\n### 阵容选择：\n\n英雄共分为5种属性，现在大部分的玩家都会选择光明属性：暮光之手，光明宣判，光明1号，曙光之刃, 光明守护者, 战争女神  。玩家可以主要升级暮光之手，光明宣判和战争女神。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NIixPespC1bYL_cBrVEsA.png?height=604&width=647)\n\n### 装备选择：\n\n可以选择做相同属性的红色装备，装备属性和英雄属性一样加成会更多。挂机奖励中装备产出的品质会随着副本通关章节而变化（算力越高挂机奖励越多），而快速挂机中的产物品质也随着通关章节而变动，装备可消耗强化石和其余不用装备进行强化，提高属性，增强战力，添加不同品质的momo也会增加一定的属性值，洗练石可对momo带有的技能进行洗练，橙色技能最优。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YkibwAeKzj5pFzFA27yi-.png?height=868&width=629)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hFSbFXI4Ld5ewgtziH2et.png?height=444&width=584)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rY2HJOkHprMvR8RHvE_bb.png?height=771&width=572)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MRjPrfnYjBdee4Cfak-3g.png?height=578&width=572)\n\n**英雄的军衔：**\n\n军衔越高，属性加成越多，上阵英雄数量也会变多（最高6个上阵英雄），随之战力值能提高，在通关和竞技场的优势越大。可使用徽章、英雄经验和钞票升级英雄的军衔。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f5dX8-OOekzFc5D9Cqxma.png?height=720&width=573)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/enCa_ZOzrM5Qo6d8ZhPH5.png?height=896&width=637)\n\n### 军团：\n\n玩家可以加入军团，类似公会。在军团福利，军团挑战以及军团商店中可以获得更多饲料以及低价卡片资源。并且军团成员消费宝箱之后会分配到各成员一定数量的金条，军团副本也可以对应的获取，参加军团大家一起建设是一个双赢的局面。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i5J-cz5ys3KQa5EIuaBKx.png?height=740&width=642)\n\n# 四.总结\n\n塔防游戏综述来说的一个长期养成的游戏，前期投入越多，基础越好，在榜单上的优势也就越大。现在游戏中的遗迹转盘每日抽奖，是大部分玩家投入游戏的主要目的，这个相当于矿机，对于投入多少产出和回本周期，根据玩家投入情况而定。\n\n目前来看游戏整体还是比较氪金，如果单纯把游戏当作挖矿的前提下，玩家可以用光明之外的卡片升星，花费较少，也可以不用购买宝箱；如果想要冲榜或者获得更好的榜单奖励收益，建议把英雄进行升星，这个比购买宝箱更划算一些。\n\n**备注：GMA推送的攻略只做参考，不构成投资建议，投资需谨慎，大家量力而行，谢谢。**\n\n\n---\n\n# 关于GMA：\n\n**GMA游戏联盟是定位于gamefi领域的一个DAO组织。参与者主要是对gamefi赛道感兴趣，有投资实力, 投研能力，且愿意分享的机构和个人。我们会不定期分享有参考价值的链游领域生态报告，项目报告、投资实例、投资策略、游戏测评。目前我们的成员包括：培才、神鱼、币圈科学家、Andy、伍声、梭教授...以及IOSG、Redline DAO、Heco、NGC...等游戏玩家、投资人以及投资机构负责人。**\n\nGMA的社交媒体平台：\n\n☆Youtube:<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI8VzM4ywAYR83epyoReydQ>\n\n☆twitter:<https://twitter.com/G_M_Alliance>\n\n☆discord:\n\n[https://discord.com/invite/bJ2JFsftSk](https://discord.com/invite/bJ2JFsftSk)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654319766, "digest": "GDZ8D7uWJRmOqP4ZMqvs6ZV8eQnv0KTVf5vvcpafVzA", "contributor": "0xB038fbCCDa6d22c4D55cf4a5Fd72998EF77ed078"}

{"id": "G7JKeyNIGCECjMquz5gdhvFdYspVADM18HJMgiDimNU", "title": "6月4日 stepn数据计算", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6FYnTaIKqFkKaFr44wVZa.jpg?height=2312&width=1416)\n\n一、STEPN昨天完成了0.7版本的更新\n\n从目前更新内容来看，上线了防作弊功能。每次完成运动后，会对运动过程进行检测，检测时长在3秒-30秒之间。\n\n从多名玩家的分享来看，一旦判断为作弊，会扣除能量，鞋子也会同样扣除耐久度，但是无法获得GST。\n\n目前对于防作弊功能的AI检测技术无法判断，按照理论来说，每个人的运动习惯在一定程度上是独有的，AI训练不难，大量的数据和时间就可以喂出来。\n\nUI界面进行了一些调整，最主要的是市场中加入了卷轴的界面。目前无法判断卷轴功能是否已经内置在0.7版本的更新中，不排除项目方在做最后测试，然后一个hotfix就可以实装上线的可能。\n\n二、市场反应\n\n这两天公关团队的加入在一定程度上避免了情况继续恶化，玩家的情绪暂时得到了稳定。按照更新完毕利好出尽，原本预计还会有一波大的抛压，但目前鞋价基本算是稳住了。算是达到了玩家阶段性情绪冰点。这一轮暴跌主要是项目方作死后，玩家情绪引发的，同时大量获利盘的出逃，导致整体市场的暴跌。出金持续大于入金，项目生命正在被透支。情绪的修复往往需要较长时间，市场后面基本上应该是横盘阴跌状态，但是跌幅会逐渐减小。如果项目方不再重蹈覆辙，在做对几次关键决策，项目重回荣光不奢望，稳定发展还是可以的。\n\n这五天项目方在搜集玩家建议，也在积极思考后续发展，汲取教训、调整策略。我们社区也正在草拟一份较为详尽的策划方案，提交给项目方。拟从当前存量和增量市场入手，通过一定场景增加内循环，打通外循环，希望能一定程度上改善stepn的现状。\n\n目前只能期望，项目方不要再作死。\n\n三、策略\n\n（一）回本周期\n\nsol链目前回本周期依旧在30天左右。但bsc链的回本周期已经长达40-60天（唯有单灰回本周期为20天）。\n\n当前最佳入场配置为9鞋配置，sol链回本周期20-22天。其中最快的配置为9灰（直接购买19级灰主鞋），其次为1绿8灰（直接购买19级绿鞋）。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KXaKjnQkFy_9b_tZA8QTf.jpg?height=3112&width=2800&size=medium)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rf19_xA8N0mN6yxIFgVGF.jpg?height=2960&width=3014&size=medium)\n\n（二）直接购买19级作为主鞋，回本周期更短\n\n由于这段时间的市场踩踏，大量廉价高级鞋正在市场低价处理。相比之下，直接购买19级鞋比购买5级鞋升级到19级，回本周期会更短。\n\n以1绿8灰为例，购买5级绿鞋升级到19级，回本周期为25天，而直接购买19级绿鞋，回本周期为21天。主要原因有两点：一是前8天，19级绿鞋每天获得gst更高；二是主鞋升级期间，没时间升级00灰，会损失大量mint收益。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8A5Jvax1agNeva8SlV6xL.jpg?height=1198&width=3878&size=large)\n\n（三）mint收益\n\n目前，sol链mint05鞋（15鞋）依旧有1个SOL的收益，BSC链mint鞋几乎没有收益。\n\n这里需要强调两点，一是mint收益是按卖出mint的鞋子计算，即卖的是00鞋，但实际操作中卖的是父母鞋（25、35等）。二是mint的期望收益包含了开出更高级鞋子的几率，比如灰灰生绿，绿绿生蓝（这里再次说一下，绿绿生蓝的几率是高于灰灰生绿的）。\n\n不过依旧有很多情况没有考虑到，比如灰灰生灰，但是出了E+R超过15点的极品鞋存在溢价。3%的几率生出trainer、甚至是小概率的灰灰生绿T情况，还有runner出jogger的溢价等。\n\n后续有时间，会对mint收益表进行更为详尽的更新。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/csaTtgc5X-k24nOVXIhXY.jpg?height=2514&width=1278)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A-cZxg9muWmetaylv7LLO.jpg?height=2312&width=1416)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654320051, "digest": "qyAA3XHiw42ky3zyr4lnUtZZrCdvaxUeAyJKa-0gyM8", "contributor": "0x394FE2061482CC1bCcBc3b336f5ca4f48168dFE1"}

{"id": "7DBU4_rsPto6CdSnBzSxLHeIpeZ65bEW48ilPJT5wwU", "title": "Why being the world's richest man isn't enough", "body": "**Musk is making moves \n **\nIs this crazy or calculated?\nThere are two extremes in my newsfeed right now.\n\n1. Crazy. Elon is a child in a sandbox. His ego, quirky nature and manic Tweets, indicate he's likely to spend $45B to raise his profile, entertain himself and stir up debate.\n2. Calculated. Elon is the genius Twitter needs. His approach to product, led by the guiding principle of free speech, will allow Twitter to command the space it occupies.\n\nBoth these perspectives are reductive. One suggests a lack of foresight altogether and the other suggests Elon has a narrow focus on a Twitter turnaround and a short-medium term return. These explanations fail to account for the depth and breadth of Elon's existing ambitions. \n\n**Let's consider his fundamental motivation**  \n  \n Elon spends 20 out of 24 hours a day leveraging capital to pull his vision for the future forward. His more sober moments demonstrate he is purpose-driven and focused on creating change at the level of our entire civilisation. \n\nElon moves humanity forward by living 10 years in the future and then investing beyond what is considered reasonable to make this a reality. He's confident in his ability to allocate capital and his record of achievement drives bigger and bigger bets\\*. \n\nChanging the world on this scale is a lofty task and will require him to deploy an unprecedented amount of capital. This is the key point, capital is the only bottleneck for him. I believe Elon's primary motivation right now is to build a money printing empire that can fund his endeavours in perpetuity.\\*\\* \n\n**Back to Twitter** \n\nElon has stated that he has few economic objectives for Twitter itself. His statements relate to free speech, open-sourcing the platform and removing bots. This has little to do with positioning Twitter as a revenue stream to fund his future ventures. \n\nBut what if Twitter as a stand-alone entity is not the endgame for Elon? \n\nCommentators have often failed to point out the synergy between Elon's companies. Many even call his distributed efforts \"multi-tasking\" and \"distractions\", an uncharitable view considering his record of disciplined, long term planning. \n\nA shortsighted news cycle has presented Twitter as the be-all and end-all for Elon. We've failed to consider the role it may play in the grandmaster's future plan alongside a portfolio of products and services. \n\n**So how could social be the $45b lynchpin in Musk's future plans?** \n\nElon owns a piece of electric vehicles, AI, neurotech, mining/drilling, space and now social. His efforts appear unrelated today, but let's consider how a man who lives 10 years in the future may think about this product and service ecosystem in its final form. \n\nIntroducing the Super App. What is a Super App? \"An app reaches super-status when it knits together a critical mass of services, makes them so easy to toggle across that, even if they aren’t as good as sole-purpose apps, the app becomes your OS for your digital life. The more services, the less reason to ever leave.\" - Scott galloway NYMagazine. Super Apps are already established in the East and most rely on social as the glue for the ecosystem, for example, \"On WeChat, you can find a date, hail a cab, pay utilities, even get divorced\". \n\nCommentators suggest a Super App in the West will be the world's first 5-10 trillion-dollar company. Now that's the kind of world bending capital that gets Elon out of bed. \n\n**Musks Super App recipe** \n\nA Super App is an amalgamation of services (commonly - transport, food delivery, e-commerce), payments and social - all wrapped up in a mobile operating system. \n\nA Super App delivers value across multiple areas of daily life. Elon will dominate the future of consumer services through AI and transport. Consider this, it's 2032, you're in your home with your Optimus robot, it's connected to 1000's of services for shopping, cooking, cleaning, building and entertainment. When you leave your smart home you power up your own self-driving car, or leverage Telsas network of cars (goodbye Uber). Furthermore, these cars are able to transport you at untold efficiency given the city-shaping infastructure created by The Boring Co. The value generated 24/7 will be enormous. \n\nA Super App needs an operating system (OS), so what's Musk's plan? Bypassing Google and Apple is no easy task. Rumours of a Tesla phone have circulated for some time. However, let's think like Elon, 10 years ahead he'd have hopes beyond the smartphone. A more appropriate OS would emerge from Neurolink. Perhaps a mind control interface is too far fetched for now (although maybe not for Elon), but a piece of tech developed by Neurolink beyond a current day smartphone is inevitable. The team's capability is already aligned, as suggested by Elon \"the way to think of the Neuralink device is kind of like a Fitbit or an Apple Watch\", the underlying technology is very similar to a smartwatch as suggested by his recent recruitment efforts. We also shouldn't underestimate Elons plans in AR/VR. In short, he has the capacity to dominate the mobile interface landscape and seamlessly connect millions to his distributed services. \n\nA Super App has payments built in to reduce friction within its ecosystem (this provides & captures additional value). As a founding member of PayPal he could easily make an organic play in payments. His service only have to compete on parity as consumers realize the majority of the product suites value beyond payments. His current balance sheet suggests an inorganic play would be difficult. However, Tesla is now the most profitable automobile manufacturer in history (32.6% gross margin) and raking in $3.3B per quarter. In 5-10 years Elon may be well-positioned to negotiate his next significant acquisition (e.g see Square/Block at a $62B market cap today). He may also partner with friends who remain at PayPal to enhance their position against Square. \n\n**So... that leaves social.** A social platform is the lifeblood of a Super App ecosystem, keeping the network active, engaged and one click away from an army of services. Elon has no play here, no experience and limited contacts. It makes sense that this is his first target in a potential shopping spree. Elon sees weakness at Meta and is busting a move to secure Twitter's social supremacy. \n\nIn this context, Elon's lack of economic aspirations for Twitter as a stand-alone product make sense. A focus beyond Twitter's financials is integral for maximising the growth, stickiness and influence of the platform. If you take away the existing incentives of social (maximising shareholder returns via an advertising model), these platforms become a much more productive place to spend time. A private owner with a different way to monetize users has incentives more aligned with the creation of a free/affordable and benevolent social platform. Profiting by connecting users with valuable services rather than exploiting their attention becomes a win-win. Elon's stunning investment in the platform starts to make economic sense across a longer timescale and within a different business model. \n\nThis Super future is feasible considering his knowledge of network effects, product development, and his global network. This ecosystem would make Elon the world's first trillionaire, and create a capital accumulation machine, unlike anything we have seen in history. \n\nBut why? If capital is a bottleneck to achieving his dreams, isn't solving climate change, AI, and drastically enhancing the quality of life on Earth enough? Why does he need a level of wealth and influence to catapult him further still, to what end? \n\nWell... we haven't talked about space yet. \n\n**Elon's 20+ year vision** \n\nLet's return to his fundamental motivation - pulling the future forward, specifically, his vision for the future. The peak of Elon's ambition for humankind lies in his sci-fi dreams. The ultimate entrepreneurial legacy Musk will leave is making progress towards establishing an independent, organised society on Mars. This is the north star driving his decision making (including seemingly sporadic $45B purchases). \n\nThe scale of the task needs no elaboration, the funding required for this crowning achievement is what is most poignant here. **Musk has estimated the capital required to establish the colony on Mars to be up to $10 Trillion**. Elon knows this kind of project is far outside the existing paradigm of capital allocators, \"making life multi-planetary is outside of the normal time horizon of Wall Street analysts. (Laughs) To say the least\" - Elon. \n\nTo pull off the most significant civilizational shift in history, he's not looking to governments, he's not looking to Wall Street or Silicon Valley, he's funding it himself through entrepreneurship. \n\nAgainst an interplanetary multi-trillion-dollar project, $230b feels like a glass more than half empty. \n\nElon needs more and Twitter is a step in the right direction. \n \n\n\\*Elon on his ability to drive financial outcomes - \"many instances where I was able to improve the financial outcome of the company by $100 million in a half-hour meeting\". For further evidence on his ability to execute over the long term, look no further than Telsas's last decade. He nearly went broke to fund his companies and this last quarter Telsa became the most profitable auto in history (32% gross margin).\n\n\n\\*\\* Teslas Giga factory - the machine that builds the machine - is an example of this kind of long term planning that results in a massive financial payoff to be reinvested elsewhere.\n\n> This was an article first shared on Linkedin on the 28th of April 2022 - since then musk has dampened his ambitions re Twitter. However, interestingly in May of 2022 during his apearence at the All In Summit, Musk commented on the validiity of Super Apps and stated that in the US it was inevitable that we have a similar service to that which exists in the East (i.e WeChat). Musk will pursue social, the question is how.", "timestamp": 1654320320, "digest": "x4VLG12pN7WfN15XGoZtkSnLuLKqw6rrw5OqUSLPRCo", "contributor": "0xF86056Dd36aA44054e77F767863246532FF2c337"}

In fact, An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. It is very worth our thinking. This fact is of great significance to me, and I believe it also has a certain significance to the world. In life, if An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. appears, we have to consider the fact that it appears. To be clear, An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. What kind of existence is it? An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. Why does it happen? Yuefu's \"Long Song Xing\" once said that if the young and strong do not work hard, the boss is sad. This seems very reasonable, right? We generally think that when we get to the crux of the problem, everything else will be solved. The meaning of An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. is actually hidden in our lives, and since this is the case, everyone has to face these issues. When faced with this kind of problem, then, Confucius said this inadvertently, the three armies can win the commander, but the individual cannot win the will. This seems very reasonable, right? An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. It is really worth exploring, Qu Yuan has a motto, the road is a long way to go, I will search up and down. This seems very reasonable, right? Heibel once said that life is school. There, it is better to say that a good teacher is a misfortune than a good teacher. I hope you can also appreciate this well. We have to face the very embarrassing fact that as for why think about An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. In fact, there is a deeper reason. The occurrence of An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. In the end, it needs to be done, and how will it happen if An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. Napoleon Hill famously said, don't wait, the timing is never just right. This makes me think deeply. Einstein once said that only by devoting oneself to society can one find the meaning of that short and risky life. With this sentence, we have to look at this question more carefully: with these questions, let's take a look at An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical.", "timestamp": 1654320389, "digest": "oUdnMzhvV9aWdYNFDlxy5_GupX6ar4vJh8YG01hgmL0", "contributor": "0x7b397dA5Bd525AAFC131107D47836304D65E446D"}

up,关于技术方面的解释对于大多数人来讲比较晦涩难懂，那本文就用最简单的方式来讲解下L2的原理 一堆人想要把钱存进银行，如果办理业务人太多会导致银行的工作达到一个饱和状态从而导致效率大大降低，L2的出现相当于是用户把钱都放到了一个管家进行托管，由管家整理好之后带入银行，从而大大缓解了银行的工作量。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gF55wXm5oOZ03z494ifES.png?height=5145&width=12589)\n\n大致了解过后，我们再来进一步讲解：Optimistic roll up与ZK roll up 的区别， Optimistic 的特点是 先把用户的数据处理好之后直接传给主链，7天之内有任何问题再把证据提交给主链，主链再帮用户把问题解决 ,特点是交易速度快！ ZK roll up的 机制与 Optimistic 机制相反，是先检查数据之后再发送到主网，所以相对来说交易速度相对较慢。\n\n官网也有许多信息可以查看，有想深入了解的朋友可以去深入了解一下下喔。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SyMpXtseub2cbCfPlmnpU.png?height=2197&width=12589)\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~[点击链接进入官网主页](https://zksync.io/)\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5qjujnrbk-bLZcZ8_bFbA.png?height=1299&width=12500)\n\n###

{"id": "-GGHbP01Y8JUc8sYz8IymDOMAtmE8hEvcHif_l5fEUo", "title": "如何在镜像上发布条目", "body": "当您想到 NFT 时，首先想到的不是书面文章。但**Mirror**正在迅速改变这一点。在本指南中，我们将深入研究**[Mirror——](https://mirror.xyz/)一个用于分享故事、资助想法以及将基于文本的内容转换为 NFT 的 web3 工具包**——并在我们自己的 Mirror 上发布一个条目！\n\n## 我需要什么？\n\n在我们开始之前，让我们确保您的装备井然有序。要在 Mirror 上创建条目，您只需要一个以太坊钱包，例如 MetaMask 或 Rainbow。\n\n*如果您在设置方面需要帮助，请访问我们的**[YouTube 频道](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCECH_RfQJOShGkYIVEXAX7w)。**在那里，您会找到**[设置钱包](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VghMd-I_-I&t=1s)的指南！***\n\n## NFT 和镜像\n\n虽然当今最流行的 NFT 是基于图像的，但图片只是 NFT 功能的一小部分。NFT（不可替代代币）的核心**只是写在区块链上的所有权证明**。这些所有权证明代表一种资产，无论是数字的还是物理的，并将其链接到个人的区块链地址。结果是一个可公开验证的文件，显示某个人拥有的某个东西。\n\n那么，一篇文章可以成为 NFT 吗？绝对地！\n\n乍一看，**Mirror**可能只是一个用于发布和货币化文章的 web3 平台——类似于基于区块链的 Medium 或 Substack。但实际上，Mirror 是创建内容和建立社区的强大工具。它为您提供铸造 NFT、众筹、从销售中分配收益，甚至铸造 ERC20 代币以分发给新社区成员所需的一切。\n\n**今天，我们将撰写我们的第一篇 Mirror 文章并将它们作为 NFT 发布。我们走吧！**\n\n## 导游\n\n### 步骤1\n\n首先，前往**[mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/)**并使用右上角的按钮**连接您的钱包。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dEQEkTWpD9TVR5MYiCMEG.jpg?height=790&width=1378)\n\n### 第2步\n\n如果这是您第一次使用 Mirror，**请转到**左侧工具栏中的“设置”选项卡以设置您的个人资料图片、简历、颜色主题和显示名称。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lN14jHUrzuphYM443l7QT.jpg?height=777&width=1365)\n\n### 第 3 步\n\n一旦您对个人资料设置感到满意，请返回“**条目**”选项卡并**单击“*创建您的第一个条目”***。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/h7yyZ-_wHOPjh-utY_KFQ.jpg?height=774&width=1376)\n\n### 第4步\n\n现在在 Write 页面上，您将可以访问 Mirror 的文本编辑器。这包括所有写作平台的基本要素——标题、项目符号列表、图像和块引用。**继续写你的文章吧！**如果您感到困惑并正在寻找灵感，请加入**[RabbitHole 社区 Discord](https://discord.gg/G9XbdKfWgz)**，寻找开始的想法！\n\n您还可以使用许多 web3 工具来将您的工作货币化并整合其他 NFT。其中包括众筹、版本、拍卖、拆分和 NFT 预览。我们不会将这些用于我们的第一个条目，但您可以**[在此处](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide)**了解有关它们的更多信息！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5txrwsSJ-TH0L0bc0A4rA.jpg?height=770&width=1356)\n\n### 第 5 步\n\n写完文章后，**点击右上角的齿轮调** **出文章设置。**上传**标题图片**（3000x1500 像素）并输入**元标题**和**条目摘录**。您的标题图像也将代表您的写作 NFT 铸造时。\n\n完成后，检查文章设置底部的元预览。这将向您展示您的文章将如何出现在 Mirror、搜索引擎和社交媒体平台上。如果您还没有**将文章保存为草稿**，这也是一个很好的时机。只需**点击**顶部的***保存草稿。***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t9Hjtlg_4APrDw-5pxA9x.jpg?height=776&width=1368)\n\n### 第 6 步\n\n现在您已经填写了书面文章、标题图片和元设置，是时候**仔细检查所有内容了**。与您铸造的任何 NFT 一样，本文将永远与您的钱包相关联！即使你卖掉它，你的钱包地址也会显示为原始创建者。因此，请务必创作一篇您乐于与之相关的原创优质文章。\n\n### 第 7 步\n\n如果一切看起来都不错，是时候发布了！单击*发布*并**打开 NFT 复选框。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-7ya8uWHtzKZ8n6p0vlHy.jpg?height=776&width=1376)\n\n### 第 8 步\n\n要发布您的文章，系统会提示您**切换到**以太坊 L2 网络 Optimism。这使得编写 NFT 可以免费创建、收集成本低，并让您的文章在多个镜像页面（如收藏页面和排行榜）中可见。\n\n如果您尚未将 Optimism 添加到您的 MetaMask，请打开您的 MetaMask 并**单击网络下拉菜单**。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I7WCSGCjFxS1Qm9CINQxs.jpg?height=185&width=1050)\n\n**单击**列表底部的***添加网络。***你会被带到这个表格：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DHVL2G2sHz2ugztWxwxgq.jpg?height=860&width=1458)\n\n在各自的字段中输入以下网络详细信息：\n\n* Network name: Optimism\n* New RPC URL: [https://mainnet.optimism.io](https://mainnet.optimism.io/)\n* Chain Id: 10\n* Currency Symbol: ETH\n* Block Explorer URL: [https://optimistic.etherscan.io](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/)\n\n**单击*保存***，您将自动连接到 Optimism！\n\n[为避免手动将 Optimism 添加到您的钱包中，您还可以通过Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/)搜索网络。\n\n### 第 9 步\n\n真正重要的部分来了：**设置您的 Writing NFT 的价格和供应。**\n\nMirror 建议设置可访问的价格（<0.01 ETH，目前 <$20 USD）和可观的供应量（>100 个单位），以便许多人能够收集您的 Writing NFT。[你可以在这里](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/mint-writing-nfts)阅读更多。\n\n考虑清楚这一点很重要。发布您的条目后，您将能够编辑其内容，但不能编辑您设置的价格和供应值。\n\n仔细考虑之后，**确认这些值并单击*Publish*。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bdMBmG2I7UBzFqIw6-N0b.jpg?height=620&width=502)\n\n## 恭喜！\n\n**就是这样！**这笔交易需要几分钟来确认，但是一旦你签署了它，NFT 将存在于 arweave 上，直到有人收集它。到那时，它就变成了 ERC721 NFT on Optimism。\n\n要查看您的写作 NFT，请访问基于 Optimism 的 NFT 市场，例如[Quixotic](https://quixotic.io/)。同样，请记住，在至少收集到您的一个写作 NFT 之前，NFT 不会出现在市场或任何人的钱包中。\n\n在 Mirror 上发布只是我们本季 NFT 旅程的一部分。要深入了解 NFT 兔子洞，请跳到我们的其他指南，了解**[在 Zora 上铸造 NFT](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/6D07Jg-YlTDoPWUK9SCQ29HXV8KmtGrOC9qfYik1dws)**或**[在 PartyBid 上加入派对](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/GzrKEGWXhw-B2ui8gO9aKShrQ8aNw1rsrelr6ZyO6Hs)**！", "timestamp": 1654320926, "digest": "saKSBIji5sASX3y45K9wC3m-6mLX-kLUD-3HwVgX6NI", "contributor": "0x9A55D9795aA6e62a19bA603A8B2467b698594E72"}

{"id": "ORJI-fsmur4KmxtdDDVgTd1GU86qra7NqS2l_VO9Ng4", "title": "End of the first week", "body": "**My observation of group dynamics when talking about work**\n\nToday I participated in SES’ weekly meeting.\n\nFirst a bit of small talk, then a lightning round where everyone on the SES team is telling what they are currently working on. It seems like a way of doing a weekly group-check in.\n\nPros (my personal opinion)\n\n* it is nice to catch up, seeing real faces and talking with colleagues is just great.\n* It is enlightening to get an idea of what is going on on a CU-level, and\n* it is interesting to hear what everyone is working on.\n\nCons (my personal opinion - I have to be very careful here 😅)\n\n* If the lightning round is used as an accountability instrument, it is in my opinion not very well suited for that purpose. If a person attending the meeting is currently not that busy, this person risks putting him or herself at stake, and will risk looking redundant to the team/leader - this makes everyone want to sound busy and express why they are working on the most important thing in the World. I have to stress, that this is a very general assessment I make here, and it was not the case for any of the participants in this meeting!\n\nI have participated in this kind of meeting for years as an attorney and as a regulator, and I will probably end up introducing it in the CU I will be facilitating as well - I wonder if there is a better alternative?\n\nMy point is, that it requires extreme confidence and trust in everyone on the team, for a person to be able, to be honest, and say: “hey guys, I’m currently not that busy, I enjoy it, and we all know that I usually perform as I’m supposed to”…\n\nWe have to allow and praise a bit of slack. Allowed slack in hospitals is what gives doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel the ability to keep up when large catastrophes occur!\n\nRequirements for optimization and being effective all the time can be dangerous, no slack can cost lives - or stress.\n\nI have so much hope for DAOs in many ways. Tonight, I will just tap into the reduction of stress. I believe the liberty in a DAO can be used to reinvent the way we work.\n\nIt requires responsibility from us all, especially the facilitators of CU’s!\n\nI promise from the bottom of my heart, that I will not carry unhealthy habits from the traditional corporate world into my Core Unit. I say this with a work history from a tier 1 law firm in Denmark. Life is simply too short.\n\nWe have to stop and take note of where good or bad culture derives from. My guess is that it is from the people constituting the DAO.\n\nI know, a DAO is simply not just a DAO, there are different archetypes. That’s a topic we can save for some other time.\n\n**This leads to a part of my work today**\n\nI went through the DAO Resilience Improvement Strategic Initiative.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8)\n\nInteresting stuff! I believe this initiative can be interpreted in two ways.\n\nOne way is negative, people are afraid they are going to be monitored and measured to ensure they are effective (remember to allow a bit of slack please). They are also afraid, that once the measurement of the CUs is done, it will be time to cut costs, meaning termination of employment - it can be seen as McKinsey’s angels of death, that has been turned into software. - You know what? You get what you measure, so be careful when concluding on details from the dashboard. And remember that not everything can be measured. 😉\n\nThe other way of viewing it is positive. Prioritization is key and identifying the critical path is so important.\n\n* This can help us reduce pseudo-work.\n* It can also help us feel the work we do is meaningful.\n* It can help us create room for slack, and by that in the end a healthier work environment.\n\nI’m definitely on the positive side. Please challenge me if you disagree, I would love to hear your take on this.\n\nI share the opinion with the initiative, that identifying the critical path must be done by starting out with the problems, risks, and challenges and from there working out the solutions.\n\nAs I understand it from Wouter and Retro, the problems must be identified from forum posts, MIPs, Discord chats, etc. Getting an aggregated overview, grouping problems, etc. sounds like a great start.\n\nHowever, I also believe the person who will later be trying to solve the problem has to enter into a conversation with the people behind the forum posts before being able to actually understand the problem.\n\nI find Clayton M Christensen’s book Competing Against Luck comprehensive on how this kind of conversation/analysis can be conducted.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612](https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612)\n\nI know it’s easier said than done.

{"id": "otlTQ7nu5QRMbhIApSRJCQoRDiu-9TpGok1lXI8KCPQ", "title": "Moland Defense｜Mobox 的塔防游戏体验及实测攻略", "body": "MOBOX是GMA一直深度参与的项目，现其中的游戏已经推出了金币大师，区块战争，ChainZ Arena等游戏，Moland Defense塔防游戏是在4月11日正式推出的新游戏，也是目前mobox里面较为火热的一款，现在进行到了第四个赛季，每两周为一个赛季。\n\n先提下塔防游戏中玩家最关心的一些问题：回本周期，入场成本，盈利情况等等。因为塔防也属于一款养成类游戏，在目前币价市场行情来看，入场成本相对于之前币价高位要少一半左右，我们自己的账户回本周期要半年左右，在榜单的100名左右。\n\n现在按照mbox代币的投入，mbox代币的一次性回本概率20%-50%（其中包含遗迹抽奖+钥匙抽奖+入场第一赛季榜单奖励），后续卡片升级也是需要水晶的消费，需要花费的水晶成本也是很大的，如果不是长期玩家，不太建议玩。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fM8r_ypYmjF8D90eAfJQJ.png?height=313&width=853)\n\n# 一.项目亮点及风险提示\n\n**亮点：**\n\n1\\.比起MOBOX平台之前推出的几款游戏，有了一定的可玩性。\n\n2\\.时间花费还可以，每天大概花半个小时左右，不是很长。\n\n3\\.玩法中有一点类似矿机和cz比较像，遗迹中大转盘类似于矿机，钥匙宝箱抽mobox的方式可一次性回本15%-40%。\n\n**风险提示：**\n\n1\\.这仍然是一个氪金的游戏，如果想冲一个好的排名或者获得收益，在后期的赛季还是需要不断充钱并且复投进去。\n\n2\\.散户不建议玩，亏钱的风险较大。\n\n# 二.游戏内经济线介绍（抽奖+P2E）\n\n玩法介绍会分为抽奖和P2E这两个部分，说明下游戏中的两条经济线，也是两种主要的收益来源。在这个部分，文章中会按照玩家投入1w个mbox代币来举例测算。\n\n**抽奖：（每日遗迹抽奖3次）**\n\n投入1万个mobox可以达到7级，每天可以进行3次大转盘抽奖，可抽到的奖励如图六选一，按照最低计算可抽到15个mobox/天，则一个赛季（14天）约收益210个mobox。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oU94UbgmbxGnXcU_FiW9J.png?height=143&width=561)\n\n**抽奖：（密钥抽奖）**\n\n投入1万个mobox，可以最少获得钥匙1000个，可以在通关摇摇乐抽宝箱，按照第26章的宝箱的规则：可以抽到（1400-4200mbox），运气较好的玩家可以一次性回本40%。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IhCg82KkYhsyixKZJZ_g8.png?height=535&width=586)\n\n综上两种抽奖方式，都是按照消费达成的等级来决定的，遗迹的大转盘抽奖是长期抽奖，每日进行，而钥匙抽宝箱可看作是一次性投入后官方给予的补贴，这个部分的抽奖概率随机性大，根据我们测试的结果一次性大概能回25%左右，大概取个中间值（不包含水晶投入）。\n\n**P2E部分**\n\n游戏中的收益主要来自登上榜单后获得mobox和水晶。\n\n榜单共有三个，分别是：竞技榜，英雄榜，关卡榜。\n\n竞技榜：玩家按照掠夺的积分进行排榜，积分越高，奖励越多\n\n英雄榜：通过抽卡之后按照获得的卡片品质获得积分，根据积分数量排榜\n\n关卡榜：按照通关的前后顺序排榜\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vkh3vvwSfgrc-Imp9OsI8.png?height=1210&width=724)\n\n以上的回本情况根据我们投入的8k个mobox来看大约每个赛季可以回本10%左右，因为额外还会每个赛季消耗水晶进行英雄的升级，这部分的消耗非常大。\n\n# 三.游戏攻略\n\n### 阵容选择：\n\n英雄共分为5种属性，现在大部分的玩家都会选择光明属性：暮光之手，光明宣判，光明1号，曙光之刃, 光明守护者, 战争女神  。玩家可以主要升级暮光之手，光明宣判和战争女神。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NIixPespC1bYL_cBrVEsA.png?height=604&width=647)\n\n### 装备选择：\n\n可以选择做相同属性的红色装备，装备属性和英雄属性一样加成会更多。挂机奖励中装备产出的品质会随着副本通关章节而变化（算力越高挂机奖励越多），而快速挂机中的产物品质也随着通关章节而变动，装备可消耗强化石和其余不用装备进行强化，提高属性，增强战力，添加不同品质的momo也会增加一定的属性值，洗练石可对momo带有的技能进行洗练，橙色技能最优。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YkibwAeKzj5pFzFA27yi-.png?height=868&width=629)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hFSbFXI4Ld5ewgtziH2et.png?height=444&width=584)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rY2HJOkHprMvR8RHvE_bb.png?height=771&width=572)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MRjPrfnYjBdee4Cfak-3g.png?height=578&width=572)\n\n**英雄的军衔：**\n\n军衔越高，属性加成越多，上阵英雄数量也会变多（最高6个上阵英雄），随之战力值能提高，在通关和竞技场的优势越大。可使用徽章、英雄经验和钞票升级英雄的军衔。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f5dX8-OOekzFc5D9Cqxma.png?height=720&width=573)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/enCa_ZOzrM5Qo6d8ZhPH5.png?height=896&width=637)\n\n### 军团：\n\n玩家可以加入军团，类似公会。在军团福利，军团挑战以及军团商店中可以获得更多饲料以及低价卡片资源。并且军团成员消费宝箱之后会分配到各成员一定数量的金条，军团副本也可以对应的获取，参加军团大家一起建设是一个双赢的局面。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i5J-cz5ys3KQa5EIuaBKx.png?height=740&width=642)\n\n# 四.总结\n\n塔防游戏综述来说的一个长期养成的游戏，前期投入越多，基础越好，在榜单上的优势也就越大。现在游戏中的遗迹转盘每日抽奖，是大部分玩家投入游戏的主要目的，这个相当于矿机，对于投入多少产出和回本周期，根据玩家投入情况而定。\n\n目前来看游戏整体还是比较氪金，如果单纯把游戏当作挖矿的前提下，玩家可以用光明之外的卡片升星，花费较少，也可以不用购买宝箱；如果想要冲榜或者获得更好的榜单奖励收益，建议把英雄进行升星，这个比购买宝箱更划算一些。\n\n**备注：GMA推送的攻略只做参考，不构成投资建议，投资需谨慎，大家量力而行，谢谢。**\n\n\n---\n\n# 关于GMA：\n\n**GMA游戏联盟是定位于gamefi领域的一个DAO组织。参与者主要是对gamefi赛道感兴趣，有投资实力, 投研能力，且愿意分享的机构和个人。我们会不定期分享有参考价值的链游领域生态报告，项目报告、投资实例、投资策略、游戏测评。目前我们的成员包括：培才、神鱼、币圈科学家、Andy、伍声、梭教授...以及IOSG、Redline DAO、Heco、NGC...等游戏玩家、投资人以及投资机构负责人。**\n\nGMA的社交媒体平台：\n\n☆Youtube:<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI8VzM4ywAYR83epyoReydQ>\n\n☆twitter:<https://twitter.com/G_M_Alliance>\n\n☆discord:\n\n[https://discord.com/invite/bJ2JFsftSk](https://discord.com/invite/bJ2JFsftSk)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654320884, "digest": "GDZ8D7uWJRmOqP4ZMqvs6ZV8eQnv0KTVf5vvcpafVzA", "contributor": "0xB038fbCCDa6d22c4D55cf4a5Fd72998EF77ed078"}
{"id": "wk45yjatvGJ3pNX2GWaOecoZkfT6vJRr8vh-yWlD40c", "title": "NFT入门小册子", "body": "本文是对我这个月来观察NFT生态的反思总结，适合新晋研究者阅读以快速熟悉行业框架并构建自己的知识体系。文中的NFT主要指代PFP性质或其它拥有类似发行方式的主流消费品性质NFT，不适用于艺术类或游戏效用类等NFT项目。所提及的项目仅为举例，不构成投资建议。\n\n## 公链\n\n* NFT数据存在于链上，不同的链有不同的NFT生态。\n  * 以太坊是目前接受度最广、NFT升值潜力最大的链，许多艺术品和权益性资产会发布在这里。\n  * Polygon作为以太坊的二层扩容方案更多被用于发行实用资产，如纪念品性质的poap或一些可以牺牲升值空间的身份证明等。日本艺术家更加喜欢使用Polygon来发布自己的艺术品并以其上的ETH结算。\n  * 另外有Flow等适合大规模商业部署的公链或Tezos等具有地域特征的艺术链，它们都拥有完全不同于以太坊的NFT（创作者、平台、分发模式等）生态。\n\n## 合约开发\n\n* 铸造NFT所需的智能合约。一个合格的智能合约应该能保证NFT发行前后链上操作的安全性和稳定性；而一个优秀的智能合约应该在满足上述条件的情况下尽可能地优化用户的交互体验（如AZUKI的ERC721A可以帮用户节约铸造gas费）。\n* 如果一个crypto项目连合约都做不好，用户又有什么理由去信任它呢？\n\n## 项目组\n\n* 包含策划、运营、市场等职能部门。一些项目组选择匿名，这并不是一个减分项，需要结合具体情况进行分析，但实名的项目更容易取得用户的信任。**实名不是单纯地使用“真实姓名”，还需要能够确实地对应到现实世界中的个人**。\n* **策划**需要确立整个项目的目标、调性和发行策略（包含总量、白名单的分发策略、销售模式等）。\n  * 一个可靠的项目应该有**鲜明的调性**，如BAYC是一群有钱而无聊的人，AZUKI是亚文化社群，小幽灵是国产的Crypto Native艺术，LAG是日本加密二次元画师的粉丝团等。仿盘在牛市可能拥有价格潜力，但私心只希望支持真正的探索者而非模仿者。\n  * **路线图应清晰且可行**。策划需要对项目有较为长远的计划，并能保证执行它们。许多土狗项目喜欢在路线图上吹得天花乱坠，但是它们表现出的实力和匿名的身份并不能让人信服这些大饼能够被做出来。\n  * 白名单分配一般包含团队预留、官方抽奖、联动抽奖、KOL抽奖、运营活动、活动预留等部分。合理的白名单分配应该在尽量满足真实用户需求的情况下为未来运营留出空间。\n  * Mint价格应该在合理范围内（一般是0.03\\~0.08ETH），更高的价格需要项目在同类产品中的显着优势来支持。一般情况下白名单Mint的数量也应在合理范围内（1\\~2个，最多3个）。\n  * 最早的销售模式是仅公售；随着流量涌入，项目方引入了白名单预售+公售的常用模式；一些强运营的项目会选择全部白名单且不存在公售；亦有以荷兰拍起步，接以带折扣的白名单预售（如AZUKI、TSUBASA），最后进入公售的模式。另外有Stealth Mint这种突击mint的形式（如BrokenSea），官方随机公布mint时间并由用户自行参与。\n* **运营**需要持续管理推特账户和Discord服务器并维持它们的活跃度（存量运营），并制定运营计划和举办活动来加强和维系用户“共识”。包括前期运营、中期运营和后期运营。\n  * 推特是窗口，Discord是大本营。**如果一个项目的Discord人数大于推特关注数三倍及以上，那么这个项目大概率挤满了工作室和机器人**，因为工作室只需要关注“肝白”的过程而不需要每个人都关注项目动态。工作室会冲一些它们能够批量获取白名单的项目，而优质的项目会反向筛选以增加真实用户的中标率。\n    * ~~工作室三连：这是什么项目？怎么白？是国人项目吗？~~\n  * 前期运营主要涵盖推特和Discord起量的过程，为项目积累种子用户。最基础的方式是同步开放推特和Discord，并同步更新项目信息。一些强运营的项目会对Discord服务器进行“计生”，定期或不定期在推特发布邀请链接并引入新成员，以此达到饥饿营销的效果。如果项目贸然采用这种方式而不具有对应的实力就会被认定为耍猴。\n  * 中期运营是最主要的环节，在这个阶段项目开始分发白名单并积累活跃用户。主要方式包括各种抽奖和各显神通的Discord活动。\n    * 抽奖包括项目内部、外部collab联动（包含一般NFT和Alpha社群）、KOL等形式。\n    * 在我的认知里Angel Metaverse最早开始引入社群内部的小团体活动（军团竞赛）以激发社群良性竞争，鼓励优质的活跃以形成正循环。Lil Blob也采用了类似的分班竞争模式。\n    * Cupcats通过频道内猜隐去的NFT特征等活动，让真正关注项目的人更有机会获得白名单。\n    * 小幽灵的秘密行动打破了虚拟与现实间的墙，非常具有meta意味，虽然难度很高。\n    * CA22的成就和小幽灵的集五鬼都可看作碎片化的白名单，让用户的每一步都有“记录”，进而激发社群活力。\n  * 后期运营同样不容忽视，除非项目方想捞一笔就跑。发行完成后的持续运营会对价格产生稳定有力的托底。\n    * 发行后的首要任务是确保路线图的执行。BrokenSea开局破发，但地板价丝毫不影响团队严格执行路线图目标。目前已顺利达成代币空投和实体服装兑换等关键节点，并成功举办多次发行后运营活动并送出奖励。\n    * 发行后依然可以进行AMA等形式的collab联动，必要时可用团队库存NFT作为奖品。河里人Rivermen起步未占到天时地利，但目前为止仍保持着稳定的AMA频率和质量，为关注者持续更新项目信息和带来新的机会。\n    * 一个合格的项目方推出第二系列的NFT、并为其前一系列持有人提供白名单权益时，将会较大地提振其前一个系列的二级市场信心（共识）。这包括变异药水（如BAYC）和全新系列（如Cupcats）等。\n  * 活跃且高质量的社群是NFT的核心，而要达成这一点99%的情况下是需要**中心化运营**的。如果一个社群框架都没搭好就要开始DAO并且来者不拒，你就已经可以收拾包裹准备跑路了。\n* **市场**主要负责获取增量流量和为项目争取资源，在项目前中期具有十分重要的任务。\n  * collab联动虽然是运营行为，但寻找collab目标并敲定合作是市场部门的职能。寻找和筛选合适的联动目标并与之沟通确定合作细节需要专人负责。\n    * 正常的联动是资源互换的过程，实力相仿的项目一般会互换白名单名额等资源来交换流量和扩展社群。通过一个项目能够争取到的联动资源，我们也可以从侧面看出项目的实力。\n    * 和研究型组织（如猫岛）、Alpha社群联动进行AMA也是不错的选择。\n    * 需要注意的是，一些项目会单方面宣布“联动”，允许一些蓝筹NFT持有者直接获得自己的白名单，这并不能算作有效的联动。\n  * KOL是另一个重要的方向。通过给不同KOL发放名额并举办转发抽奖活动提升自己的影响力也是非常常用的营销手段。\n    * 一些海外KOL会定期发起“预算”由粉丝推荐购买项目，这时需要运营部门配合进行“twitter raid”让用户去下面留言推荐自己的项目。被选中的项目会在短期内获得该KOL粉丝的极大关注。\n    * 通过合作KOL的类型和质量也可以看出项目的实力和格局。目前已经有黑灰产KOL存在，他们通过买粉买量伪装身份骗取白名单资格。项目方和用户都需要擦亮双眼。\n\n## 第三方项目组成员\n\n* 受成本、人脉等各种因素限制，许多NFT项目组仅仅包含了核心的策划职能，因而诞生了一些专门接取“外包”运营和市场功能的个人或团体来辅助项目方。但是这个行业目前还非常早期，存在着许多不规范的现象，甚至诞生了黑灰产。\n  * “职业MOD”一般以个人居多。他们往往喜欢“广撒网多捞鱼”，用一套固定的话术进入各个NFT社群并申请MOD，通过付出劳动换取项目方赠与的白名单资格。他们可能拥有一定的社群管理经验，但大多仅限于维护聊天秩序、格式化地引导新人等基础能力，极少有人能够真正把握到每个项目真正的核心竞争力并将其代入到运营中，为社群带来真正的价值。**个人认为，项目方应该拥有自己的社群管理部门；从用户中选拔的MOD应严格遵循一些原则，宁缺毋滥**。\n  * 部分专门进行市场行为的独立个人或组织会以顾问等形式参与到项目方的营销活动中。他们往往拥有较多的社群资源，能够快速帮项目对接和敲定联动，建立起流量优势，并从项目方取得白名单等资源作为报酬。规范化的市场小组可能在短期内有一定的发展空间。与伪造KOL类似，也有一些个人或组织伪造市场小组来骗取白名单。\n\n# 场外白名单交易\n\n* 由市场过热催生出的商业模式，主要参与者为白名单工作室和担保人等。\n* 白名单工作室，顾名思义是通过劳动密集型劳作批量获取白名单的组织。\n  * 以线下或线上的形式安排廉价劳动力（一般是大学生，更高级的还有小语种本地人以避开对中文区更强的规制）高强度参与NFT社群活跃（俗称肝白），并以此获得白名单名额并在场外出售获利，价格一般从100U到1ETH不等。真·网络兼职日入上百，但随着泡沫消退和韭菜受教育程度提高，场外白名单交易的收益显着下降。\n    * 场外白名单流动性极差，价格滑点大，定价完全受供需影响，相对项目真实价值往往具有较大偏差。较为合理的白名单定价会吃走项目真实的Alpha作为mint价的浮盈存在。\n  * 随着白名单规则的更新，诞生了一批以“卖艺”维生的工作室。形式包括但不限于板绘、手绘、沙画、3D建模、编曲、弹唱、堆雪人等，通常在闲鱼或微信接单。通过收取约100\\~300元不等的价格产出符合要求的fanart或其它作品，由单主自行投递。\n* 亦有为肝白者提供服务的组织。\n  * 皇帝肝是一个较为典型的肝白互助组织，通过集结个人肝白者统一行动获得较大的声量和话语权，并为组织产生一些额外收益。\n  * JuanDAO等作为第三方平台为个人白名单场外交易者提供辅助，承担信息聚合、买卖撮合和交易担保等功能。\n  * 职业担保人为白名单交易提供信用保障。一般流程为卖家填写买家地址或直接出售Discord账号，买家打钱给担保人，待确认交易结束后担保人将钱款打给卖家。其间产生的服务费由买卖双方商议并按约定比例支付给担保人作为报酬。\n    * 个人不推荐进行场外交易，但如果一定要交易请**务必选择可靠的担保人**，任何一个仅由对方推荐的担保人都可能是骗局。**如果对方只认某个特定担保人，除非自己确认担保人为真，否则直接当诈骗处置**。\n\n# 发行 · 交易平台\n\n* 不同的项目方会有不同的运营风格，从而选择不同的发行方式。此处仅讨论消费品和部分偏消费品的NFT（比如日本二次元加密艺术家画的二次元小画片），主要涉及三种发行方式。\n  * PFP类项目都是项目组自己开发合约，一级发行时由用户通过合约mint，并在OpenSea等二级市场交易流通。\n  * 一些艺术家会选择使用OpenSea的一键上链功能铸造自己的NFT，然后通过OpenSea的拍卖或bid功能进行一级发售。许多加密艺术家喜欢使用这种方式。\n  * 另一些艺术家会选择在Foundation等NFT艺术品平台通过拍卖等方式一级发售自己的作品，这些作品也可以进入OpenSea等二级市场流通。与上面一点不同的是，这类NFT往往发行价格更高且受众更窄，一般是具有一定实力的艺术家才会采用这种方式。\n\n# NFT工具\n\n* 为NFT用户提供支持的辅助工具，用数据支持逻辑，辅助投资或投机行为。\n  * Nansen等数据平台一般为订阅制，为付费用户提供NFT二级交易数据追踪服务。它们一般除了拥有基础的交易数据以外还有更多包含潜在分析价值的仪表盘，以及巨鲸行为追踪等附加功能。总的来说可以为投资者提供更多的信息以做出更及时更科学的决策。\n  * Gem等NFT聚合平台可以为用户聚合主流NFT二级市场的挂单信息，减少信息差并为用户提供更优的价格选择。另外Gem还为用户提供打包购买功能和扫地板等功能，以帮助用户节省gas费用和提供更加便捷的交易方式。\n  * Trait Sniper等稀有度工具可以通过浏览器插件或网页的形式帮用户快速查看NFT在同collection中的稀有度排名，进而帮助用户快速进行价值/价格判断和定位贱卖的高罕NFT。\n\n# 用户组织\n\n* NFT玩家或用户组成的各类分享资源和信息的组织。\n  * Alpha社群一般具有规模小、人员重合度高、身份标识NFT价格贵等特征，一般要求用户持有自己的NFT才能进入核心社群交流，门槛较高。社群中一般会提供各类一手信息、巨鲸追踪、市场异动报警等服务。Alpha社群经常能从新的优质项目中拿到大量白名单资源。\n  * 投研社群如321等，以研究驱动，对资金门槛没有要求。社群成员之间相互分享优质项目和逻辑并交流讨论，以期达到更好的投资成果。\n  * 肝白互助组织如皇帝肝，上文提过此处不再赘述。\n  * 另有一些类似KOL粉丝社群的组织，一般会为其粉丝提供更直接的交流机会和其对接到的资源的优先获取权等。\n\n# 创作者组织\n\n* 为志同道合的NFT创作者提供交流和互助平台的组织，一般由较有影响力的艺术家发起。\n  * 偏内向型的创作者团体如WeirDAO是国内加密艺术家团体，内部艺术家互动频繁，曾发布过合作作品。近期很火的小幽灵便是其中一名艺术家Sleepy的作品，该系列中有大量1/1作品出自WeirDAO其它艺术家之手。\n  * 偏外向型的创作者团体如Soudan NFT · Love Addicted

Single community**\n\nโดยปกติแล้วในแต่ละเกม หากเราเล่นไปนานระดับหนึ่ง เราก็จะมีสังคมในกลุ่มผู้เล่นในเกมนั้นๆ แต่หากเราเปลี่ยนเกมเล่น สังคมนั้นก็จะหายไป แต่จะเป็นอย่างไรหากเราร่วมเหล่าผู้เล่นเกมในทุกรูปแบบมาอยู่ในที่เดียวกัน ผมเชื่อว่าคงจะทำให้การเล่นเกมมีความสนุกมากขึ้นอย่างแน่นอน\n\nIgnite Tournaments มีฟีเจอร์เกี่ยวกับเรื่อง Social network แม้ว่าตอนนี้จะยังไม่เผยรายละเอียดออกมา แต่ผมเชื่อว่าการที่คนเล่นเกมมารวมกันอยู่ที่เดียวกันนั้น เราคงจะได้มีเพื่อนกลุ่มสนิทที่รู้ใจกัน และตามไปช่วยกันฟอร์มทีมในทุกๆเกมอย่างแน่นอน\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DJgQUDifBrjhfZsdqCrGs.png?height=525&width=700)\n\n**3. Partnership privilege**\n\nในโลก web3 สิ่งที่สำคัญที่สุดคือเรื่องของการจับมือกันเพื่อสร้าง ecosystem ที่ครบวงจร และตอบโจทย์ผู้ใช้งานมากที่สุดเท่าที่จะเป็นไปได้ สำหรับ Ignite Tournament แน่นอนว่าเราจะเห็นการพาร์ทเนอร์ร่วมกับเกม หรือกิลด์ อย่างไม่ขาดสาย\n\nสิ่งนี้จะช่วยให้ผู้เล่นบน Ignite Tournaments ได้สิทธิพิเศษเพิ่มเติม และมากกว่านั้น โดยส่วนตัว ผมเชื่อว่า reward ที่เราได้รับมา อาจจะนำมาแลกสิทธิเพิ่มเติมสำหรับเกมใหม่ๆได้ ซึ่งสิ่งนี้เรียกว่าหายากมากๆในโลกเกมมือถือปัจจุบัน (web2)\n\nIgnite Tournaments Forms Partnership with MetaGods\nIgnite Tournaments Forms Partnership with MetaGods\nและนี่คือ 3 เหตุผลว่าทำไม Ignite Tournaments ผมถึงมองว่า Ignite Tournaments น่าจับตามองในปี 2022\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4b5kxAVjRNewvaqaSvUI.png?height=831&width=1605)\n\nติดตามเราผ่านทางช่องทางหลักของเรา\n\nDiscord: <https://discord.gg/3yanX8n4pJ>\n\nTelegram: <https://t.me/ignitetournaments>\n\nTwitter: <https://twitter.com/igniteyourgames>\n\nMedium: <https://medium.com/ignite-tournaments>\n\nWebsite: <https://ignitetournaments.com>", "timestamp": 1654321312, "digest": "NyzyW-a-t3aIuqXnUUoFeCwjxKKrsr4QUYP7TYOO7sc", "contributor": "0x5B36002E5Ee1103A44246f67b067FD5509b97A9E"}

{"id": "qS16fbFfJ-TErRoJAMISs1FesYHj-vy-xxLfwnFicw8", "title": "Metaverse land and real estate", "body": "People have talked about the concept of “digital real estate” for decades. Historically, the phrase has referred to scarce space – often dedicated to advertising – on a given publisher’s website, like the New York Times homepage. Today, people have grown accustomed to centralized entities and attention aggregators – the likes of Facebook and Google – owning many of these spaces, which they rent out.\n\nDigital real estate has always had value. What’s different about web3 is that digital asset paradigms like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) make it possible for individuals to uniquely own – not just rent – specific pieces of digital real estate and metaverse land and locations for private or shared use. Blockchains, a core web3 technology, enable this by offering decentralized, tamper-resistant, and publicly accessible records of who owns which digital assets.\n\nGiven that digital space is, in theory, infinitely expansible, skeptics might still question whether the concept of “owning” digital land or buildings even makes sense.\n\nBut metaverse platforms have their own forms of scarcity: There’s only so much space on the wall of a digital building, for example; and thanks to geography, there are only so many buildings close to an amenity like a virtual concert hall or a resource deposit like a Vespene geyser.\n\nBut at the same time, distance can be less of a factor thanks to the possibility of fast travel or teleportation. Thus, what matters for thinking about the value of a given piece of metaverse land and real estate is how people’s activities inform its use.\n\nPeople (or rather, their avatars) might walk out of a virtual concert together and then meander down an adjacent virtual shopping strip. Just like in the physical world, then, the shops closest to the virtual conference hall will get the most “foot traffic.” \n \n\nIndeed, there’s a sense in which proximity to metaverse events and amenities might sometimes be more valuable than in the physical world: the audience for a virtual concert, for example, is global, which can in principle bring a lot of attention to whatever’s in the digital-building next door.\n\nYet virtual proximity matters far less at middle-to-long distances. In the physical world, there’s significant value to having a house in the suburbs because it affords more space while still making it possible to work in the city nearby. But when it’s possible to commute by teleporting, it doesn’t matter whether your virtual “home” is anywhere near your “work” in the underlying metaverse geography.\n\nMore broadly, in the metaverse, people are unlikely to engage in time-consuming long-distance travel when there’s the option of teleporting. The one exception is when long-distance travel is itself a valuable or entertaining activity – such as taking a virtual ferry where one can explore and play games while in transit.\n\nAll of this means that the value of metaverse land and real estate to users will likely depend on what’s locally proximate, rather than on the full geography of that metaverse. We can expect to see thriving shopping malls, micro-cities, or even entire virtual worlds that are kind of like islands in digital space – packed with activity that leads people to travel locally within them – yet separated by “distances” large enough that people will just teleport across them.\n\nIt doesn’t even matter whether these different activities are on the same platform. Just like we might use Zoom for meetings at work and Messenger or Snapchat to socialize, someone might work in Meta’s Horizon Workrooms; then hang out with friends in The Sandbox; and curate their own private art gallery in Voxels.\n\nThe metaverse platform market is unlikely to be winner-take-all. Moreover, even within a given platform, there are likely to be many successful activity clusters – and entrepreneurs can try to launch their own by developing novel amenities or resources that serve as hubs for others to build around. That’s the beauty of composability, a core feature of web3 that lets people build on and adapt existing frameworks to create new experiences. \\[1\\]\n\n\\[1\\] Scott Duke Kominers, 2022, Metaverse Land: What Makes Digital Real Estate Valuable", "timestamp": 1654322036, "digest": "Kv_9JtVkAlnzGdUVdxKw8yktJBu9ZUsfKrndl4K1xoM", "contributor": "0x2716e3557a40B51B8977367e879Ca4675FAd2d39"}
{"id": "vffJgOVb1td2BDxyxDImmB4-_oBHyGbfwalff3qiH1o", "title": "End of the first week", "body": "**My observation of group dynamics when talking about work**\n\nToday I participated in SES’ weekly meeting.\n\nFirst, there was a bit of small talk, then a lightning round where everyone on the SES team is telling what they are currently working on. It seems like a way of doing a weekly group-check in.\n\nPros\n\n* it is nice to catch up, seeing real faces and talking with colleagues is just great.\n* It is enlightening to get an idea of what is going on at the CU-level, and\n* it is interesting to hear what everyone is working on.\n\nCons (my personal opinion - I have to be very careful here 😅)\n\n* If the lightning round is used as an accountability instrument, it is in my opinion not very well suited for that purpose. If a person attending the meeting is currently not that busy, this person risks putting him or herself at stake, and will risk looking redundant to the team/leader - this makes everyone want to sound busy and express why they are working on the most important thing in the World. I have to stress, that this is a very general assessment I am making here, and it was not the case for any of the participants in this meeting!\n\nI have participated in this kind of meeting for years as an attorney and as a regulator, and I will probably end up introducing it in the CU I will be facilitating as well - I wonder if there is a better alternative?\n\nMy point is, that it requires extreme confidence and trust in everyone on the team, for a person to be able, to be honest, and say: “hey guys, I’m currently not that busy, I enjoy it, and I hope we all know that I usually perform as I’m supposed to”…\n\nWe have to allow and praise a bit of slack. Allowed slack in hospitals is what gives doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel the ability to keep up when large catastrophes occur!\n\nIf we keep adding requirements for optimization and for everyone to be 100% effective all the time, it can be dangerous, no slack stresses people.\n\nI have so much hope for DAOs in many ways. Tonight, I will just tap into the reduction of stress. I believe the liberty in a DAO can be used to reinvent the way we work.\n\nIt requires responsibility from all of us, especially the facilitators of the CU’s!\n\nI promise from the bottom of my heart, that I will not carry unhealthy habits from the traditional corporate world into the Core Unit I will be a part of. I say this with a work history from a tier 1 law firm in Denmark. Life is simply too short.\n\nWe have to stop and take note of where good or bad culture derives from. My guess is that it is from the people constituting the DAO.\n\nI know, a DAO is not just simply a DAO, there are different archetypes. That’s a topic we can save for some other time.\n\n**This leads to a part of my work today**\n\nI went through the DAO Resilience Improvement Strategic Initiative.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8)\n\nInteresting stuff! I believe this initiative can be interpreted in two ways.\n\nThe first way is negative, people are afraid they are going to be monitored and measured to ensure they are effective (remember to allow a bit of slack please). They are also afraid, that once the measurement of the CUs is done, it will be time to cut costs, meaning termination of employment - it can be seen as McKinsey’s angels of death, that has been turned into software. - You know what? You get what you measure, so be careful when concluding on details from the dashboard. And remember that not everything can be measured. 😉\n\nThe other way of viewing it is positive. Prioritization is key and identifying the critical path is so important.\n\n* This can help us reduce pseudo-work.\n* It can also help us feel the work we do is meaningful.\n* I will help us manage during tough times, \n* It can help us create room for slack, and by that in the end a healthier work environment.\n\nI’m definitely on the positive side. Please challenge me if you disagree, I would love to hear your take on this.\n\nI share the opinion with the initiative, that identifying the critical path must be done by starting out with the problems, risks, and challenges and from there working out the solutions.\n\nAs I understand it from Wouter and Retro, the problems must be identified from forum posts, MIPs, Discord chats, etc. Getting an aggregated overview, grouping problems, etc. sounds like a great start.\n\nHowever, I also believe the person who will later be trying to solve the problem has to enter into a conversation with the people behind the forum posts before being able to actually understand the problem.\n\nI find Clayton M Christensen’s book Competing Against Luck comprehensive on how this kind of conversation/analysis can be conducted.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612](https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612)\n\nI know it’s easier said than done. And it would take a lot of time.\n\nIn case an aggregated problem scoreboard is being built, my suggestion is to make sure the discord handle, email address, and name are always referred to, so the people behind the initial post can be identified and reached out in case of a conversation is needed at a later stage.\n\nIf you are into the reduction of pseudowork, I can highly recommend Dennis Nørremark’s book.\n\n[https://www.williamdam.dk/pseudowork__1899317](https://www.williamdam.dk/pseudowork__1899317)\n\n**Thanks so much for the feedback!**\n\nI had some great feedback on my two first posts.

{"id": "YWt9MMG8JFFYNgJ5AEV3yQ27Ulcli9-rV5IcqQe-rdg", "title": "Moland Defense｜Mobox 的塔防游戏体验及实测攻略", "body": "MOBOX是GMA一直深度参与的项目，现其中的游戏已经推出了金币大师，区块战争，ChainZ Arena等游戏，Moland Defense塔防游戏是在4月11日正式推出的新游戏，也是目前mobox里面较为火热的一款，现在进行到了第四个赛季，每两周为一个赛季。\n\n先提下塔防游戏中玩家最关心的一些问题：回本周期，入场成本，盈利情况等等。因为塔防也属于一款养成类游戏，在目前币价市场行情来看，入场成本相对于之前币价高位要少一半左右，我们自己的账户回本周期要半年左右，在榜单的100名左右。\n\n现在按照mbox代币的投入，mbox代币的一次性回本概率20%-50%（其中包含遗迹抽奖+钥匙抽奖+入场第一赛季榜单奖励），后续卡片升级也是需要水晶的消费，需要花费的水晶成本也是很大的，如果不是长期玩家，不太建议玩。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fM8r_ypYmjF8D90eAfJQJ.png?height=313&width=853)\n\n# 一.项目亮点及风险提示\n\n**亮点：**\n\n1\\.比起MOBOX平台之前推出的几款游戏，有了一定的可玩性。\n\n2\\.时间花费还可以，每天大概花半个小时左右，不是很长。\n\n3\\.玩法中有一点类似矿机和cz比较像，遗迹中大转盘类似于矿机，钥匙宝箱抽mobox的方式可一次性回本15%-40%。\n\n**风险提示：**\n\n1\\.这仍然是一个氪金的游戏，如果想冲一个好的排名或者获得收益，在后期的赛季还是需要不断充钱并且复投进去。\n\n2\\.散户不建议玩，亏钱的风险较大。\n\n# 二.游戏内经济线介绍（抽奖+P2E）\n\n玩法介绍会分为抽奖和P2E这两个部分，说明下游戏中的两条经济线，也是两种主要的收益来源。在这个部分，文章中会按照玩家投入1w个mbox代币来举例测算。\n\n**抽奖：（每日遗迹抽奖3次）**\n\n投入1万个mobox可以达到7级，每天可以进行3次大转盘抽奖，可抽到的奖励如图六选一，按照最低计算可抽到15个mobox/天，则一个赛季（14天）约收益210个mobox。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oU94UbgmbxGnXcU_FiW9J.png?height=143&width=561)\n\n**抽奖：（密钥抽奖）**\n\n投入1万个mobox，可以最少获得钥匙1000个，可以在通关摇摇乐抽宝箱，按照第26章的宝箱的规则：可以抽到（1400-4200mbox），运气较好的玩家可以一次性回本40%。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IhCg82KkYhsyixKZJZ_g8.png?height=535&width=586)\n\n综上两种抽奖方式，都是按照消费达成的等级来决定的，遗迹的大转盘抽奖是长期抽奖，每日进行，而钥匙抽宝箱可看作是一次性投入后官方给予的补贴，这个部分的抽奖概率随机性大，根据我们测试的结果一次性大概能回25%左右，大概取个中间值（不包含水晶投入）。\n\n**P2E部分**\n\n游戏中的收益主要来自登上榜单后获得mobox和水晶。\n\n榜单共有三个，分别是：竞技榜，英雄榜，关卡榜。\n\n竞技榜：玩家按照掠夺的积分进行排榜，积分越高，奖励越多\n\n英雄榜：通过抽卡之后按照获得的卡片品质获得积分，根据积分数量排榜\n\n关卡榜：按照通关的前后顺序排榜\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vkh3vvwSfgrc-Imp9OsI8.png?height=1210&width=724)\n\n以上的回本情况根据我们投入的8k个mobox来看大约每个赛季可以回本10%左右，因为额外还会每个赛季消耗水晶进行英雄的升级，这部分的消耗非常大。\n\n# 三.游戏攻略\n\n### 阵容选择：\n\n英雄共分为5种属性，现在大部分的玩家都会选择光明属性：暮光之手，光明宣判，光明1号，曙光之刃, 光明守护者, 战争女神  。玩家可以主要升级暮光之手，光明宣判和战争女神。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NIixPespC1bYL_cBrVEsA.png?height=604&width=647)\n\n### 装备选择：\n\n可以选择做相同属性的红色装备，装备属性和英雄属性一样加成会更多。挂机奖励中装备产出的品质会随着副本通关章节而变化（算力越高挂机奖励越多），而快速挂机中的产物品质也随着通关章节而变动，装备可消耗强化石和其余不用装备进行强化，提高属性，增强战力，添加不同品质的momo也会增加一定的属性值，洗练石可对momo带有的技能进行洗练，橙色技能最优。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YkibwAeKzj5pFzFA27yi-.png?height=868&width=629)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hFSbFXI4Ld5ewgtziH2et.png?height=444&width=584)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rY2HJOkHprMvR8RHvE_bb.png?height=771&width=572)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MRjPrfnYjBdee4Cfak-3g.png?height=578&width=572)\n\n**英雄的军衔：**\n\n军衔越高，属性加成越多，上阵英雄数量也会变多（最高6个上阵英雄），随之战力值能提高，在通关和竞技场的优势越大。可使用徽章、英雄经验和钞票升级英雄的军衔。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f5dX8-OOekzFc5D9Cqxma.png?height=720&width=573)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/enCa_ZOzrM5Qo6d8ZhPH5.png?height=896&width=637)\n\n### 军团：\n\n玩家可以加入军团，类似公会。在军团福利，军团挑战以及军团商店中可以获得更多饲料以及低价卡片资源。并且军团成员消费宝箱之后会分配到各成员一定数量的金条，军团副本也可以对应的获取，参加军团大家一起建设是一个双赢的局面。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i5J-cz5ys3KQa5EIuaBKx.png?height=740&width=642)\n\n# 四.总结\n\n塔防游戏综述来说的一个长期养成的游戏，前期投入越多，基础越好，在榜单上的优势也就越大。现在游戏中的遗迹转盘每日抽奖，是大部分玩家投入游戏的主要目的，这个相当于矿机，对于投入多少产出和回本周期，根据玩家投入情况而定。\n\n目前来看游戏整体还是比较氪金，如果单纯把游戏当作挖矿的前提下，玩家可以用光明之外的卡片升星，花费较少，也可以不用购买宝箱；如果想要冲榜或者获得更好的榜单奖励收益，建议把英雄进行升星，这个比购买宝箱更划算一些。\n\n**备注：GMA推送的攻略只做参考，不构成投资建议，投资需谨慎，大家量力而行，谢谢。**\n\n\n---\n\n# 关于GMA：\n\n**GMA游戏联盟是定位于gamefi领域的一个DAO组织。参与者主要是对gamefi赛道感兴趣，有投资实力, 投研能力，且愿意分享的机构和个人。我们会不定期分享有参考价值的链游领域生态报告，项目报告、投资实例、投资策略、游戏测评。**\n\nGMA的社交媒体平台：\n\n☆Youtube:<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI8VzM4ywAYR83epyoReydQ>\n\n☆twitter:<https://twitter.com/G_M_Alliance>\n\n☆discord:\n\n[https://discord.com/invite/bJ2JFsftSk](https://discord.com/invite/bJ2JFsftSk)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654322179, "digest": "GDZ8D7uWJRmOqP4ZMqvs6ZV8eQnv0KTVf5vvcpafVzA", "contributor": "0xB038fbCCDa6d22c4D55cf4a5Fd72998EF77ed078"}

{"id": "1ew2Fw4P0MoWCfZDgHFwowdoxBvaA4e6sq9TR1dYG9s", "title": "End of the first week", "body": "**My observation of group dynamics when talking about work**\n\nToday I participated in SES’ weekly meeting.\n\nFirst, there was a bit of small talk, then a lightning round where everyone on the SES team is telling what they are currently working on. It seems like a way of doing a weekly group-check in.\n\nPros\n\n* it is nice to catch up, seeing real faces and talking with colleagues is just great.\n* It is enlightening to get an idea of what is going on at the CU-level, and\n* it is interesting to hear what everyone is working on.\n\nCons (my personal opinion - I have to be very careful here 😅)\n\n* If the lightning round is used as an accountability instrument, it is in my opinion not very well suited for that purpose. If a person attending the meeting is currently not that busy, this person risks putting him or herself at stake, and will risk looking redundant to the team/leader - this makes everyone want to sound busy and express why they are working on the most important thing in the World. I have to stress, that this is a very general assessment I am making here, and it was not the case for any of the participants in this meeting!\n\nI have participated in this kind of meeting for years as an attorney and as a regulator, and I will probably end up introducing it in the CU I will be facilitating as well - I wonder if there is a better alternative?\n\nMy point is, that it requires extreme confidence and trust in everyone on the team, for a person to be able, to be honest, and say: “hey guys, I’m currently not that busy, I enjoy it, and I hope we all know that I usually perform as I’m supposed to”…\n\nWe have to allow and praise a bit of slack. Allowed slack in hospitals is what gives doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel the ability to keep up when large catastrophes occur!\n\nIf we keep adding requirements for optimization and for everyone to be 100% effective all the time, it can be dangerous, no slack stresses people.\n\nI have so much hope for DAOs in many ways. Tonight, I will just tap into the reduction of stress. I believe the liberty in a DAO can be used to reinvent the way we work.\n\nIt requires responsibility from all of us, especially the facilitators of the CU’s!\n\nI promise from the bottom of my heart, that I will not carry unhealthy habits from the traditional corporate world into the Core Unit I will be a part of. I say this with a work history from a tier 1 law firm in Denmark. Life is simply too short.\n\nWe have to stop and take note of where good or bad culture derives from. My guess is that it is from the people constituting the DAO.\n\nI know, a DAO is not just simply a DAO, there are different archetypes. That’s a topic we can save for some other time.\n\n**This leads to a part of my work today**\n\nI went through the DAO Resilience Improvement Strategic Initiative.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8)\n\nInteresting stuff! I believe this initiative can be interpreted in two ways.\n\nThe first way is negative, people are afraid they are going to be monitored and measured to ensure they are effective (remember to allow a bit of slack please). They are also afraid, that once the measurement of the CUs is done, it will be time to cut costs, meaning termination of employment - it can be seen as McKinsey’s angels of death, that has been turned into software. - You know what? You get what you measure, so be careful when concluding on details from the dashboard. And remember that not everything can be measured. 😉\n\nThe other way of viewing it is positive. Prioritization is key and identifying the critical path is so important.\n\n* This can help us reduce pseudo-work.\n* It can also help us feel the work we do is meaningful.\n* I will help us manage during tough times, \n* It can help us create room for slack, and by that in the end a healthier work environment.\n\nI definitely belong to the positive side. Please try changing me if you disagree, I would love to hear your arguments.\n\nI share the opinion with the initiative, that identifying the critical path must be done by starting out with the problems, risks, and challenges and from there working out the solutions.\n\nAs I understand from Wouter and Retro’s presentation, the problems must be identified and curated from forum posts, MIPs, Discord chats, etc. \n\nGetting an aggregated overview, grouping problems, etc. sounds like a great start.\n\nHowever, I also believe the person who will later be trying to solve the problem has to enter into a conversation with the people behind the forum posts before being able to actually understand the problem.\n\nI find Clayton M Christensen’s book Competing Against Luck comprehensive on how this kind of conversation/analysis can be conducted.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612](https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612)\n\nI know it’s easier said than done. And it would take a lot of time.\n\nIn case an aggregated problem scoreboard is being built, my suggestion is to make sure the discord handle, email address, and name are always referred to, so the person or people who initially raised the problem can be identified and reached out in case a conversation is needed at a later stage.\n\nIf you are into the reduction of pseudo work, I can highly recommend Dennis Nørremark’s book.\n\n[https://www.williamdam.dk/pseudowork__1899317](https://www.williamdam.dk/pseudowork__1899317)\n\n**Thanks so much for the feedback!**\n\nI had some great feedback on my two first posts.

We can sell them on secondary markets or transfer them to other users. There are also times when we want the NFT to be non-transferable. For example, maybe we want to reward our community with some exclusive award NFT to those who completed a challenge, or maybe for issuing NFT certificates. \n  \n In this guide, we will learn how to make it so users can't transfer or sell our NFTs. This process can all be done without writing any code. Let’s get started! \n  \n Setup​\n\nNavigate to the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard), and create a new contract: choose from either an **NFT Collection, Edition, NFT Drop,** or **Edition Drop**. You can make your NFT non-transferable in any of these versions.\n\nFor this guide, we will create an **NFT Collection** contract.\n\nFill out the general settings to distinguish your contracts and payout settings. After that, scroll down and click the blue bar at the bottom that says **Deploy Now**. \n  \n Next, click the blue **Mint +** button on the top right. This will pull up a side panel that will allow us to create our NFT. After filling in the fields, click **+ Mint NFT** to finish the minting process. \n  \n Make it non-transferable​\n\nOnce created, you should see your newly minted NFT on your dashboard. Click on the **permissions** tab. \n From the permissions tab, scroll down to the **Transfer** permissions. Click the drop down that says **transferable** and change it to **Non-transferable.**\n\nAfter updating, click on **update permissions**. This will prompt a transaction you need to confirm from your wallet. \n  \n Permissions​\n\nOnce updated, only addresses with the **Transfer** role are able to transfer the NFT. By default, this is set to the wallet that created the NFT. \n If you don’t want to be able to transfer the NFT, remove yourself from the **transfer** permissions and update permissions again.\n\n \n Source : \n\n[https://portal.thirdweb.com/guides/make-your-nft-non-transferable](https://portal.thirdweb.com/guides/make-your-nft-non-transferable)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654322961, "digest": "HZGcj0bTKXbtRJAkqXJ59rwd8wVXQBs2Ichc5_YQgCQ", "contributor": "0x3f8E41BA3867ae0C92A916b6AB909E34D243f0DE"}
{"id": "3nDgJn908Pba-RUevY-_Zoct6XnnwmHhbs9FC8mtbxQ", "title": "Draft 1", "body": "Why do users restrain from using blockchain? **Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubts.** \n\nInternet have scams and frauds, but still a lot of users use it, because it offers a far greater benefits than without it. It not only goes through a stage overcoming fear, uncertainties, and doubts, but also goes through a stage where, without it, people feel “they can’t live anymore.” Internet creates a dependency where its users depends on it. Its users are mostly addicted to it. We can see, with terms like “internet sabbaticals”, “restricting internet access time” coming up days to days. How does people restraint from using web3? \n\nFear, uncertainties, and doubts. While there exist internet banking today, various precautions and safety are in place that provides a safe haven for users to use. By safe haven, one don’t mean somewhere that’s absolutely safe. Password digest transferred through the internet isn’t absolutely safe, nor are password saved inside a database risk being hacked. A safe haven is somewhere where users find their community, where users can stop worrying about the various headaches of forgetting their passwords, of the security, etc. ***It’s something more emotional than logical***. \n\nConsidering blockchain. We assign the responsibility of each users to themselves, that they would keep their ledger safe, that they would keep their secure passphrase safe, that they won’t forget what their secure passphrase is. Not every users know how to put their password in Excel and encrypt their Excel file. Not every users have the thoughts of backing things up. And as a human, if we can stop worrying about something and assign that responsibility to somebody else, we tend to. ***We’re in favor of someone holding responsibility for us, so when things goes wrong, we can blame them than ourselves.*** It’s their fault, not ours, to lose our stuffs. We have something more important to care about, and we had already reassign these attention-demanding passwords and security to some experts and trustible entity to keep them for us. Blockchain tries to assign the responsibility back to the users that causes upheaval: a fear that they would lose their password and no one to back them up, no one there to help them, and they are in the water themselves, no one to save them. \n\nHuman lives as a team, a group, a collective beings. For most of us, we derive our security from external situations: either it be some materials, or another human being, usually someone close to us. It’s a miracle for us, deriving security from external circumstances, to take responsibility for ourselves, which derives internal security (or assigning security to our Gods), to keep something secure ourselves, without a “Forget your Password?” button to back things up. \n\nEnd users doubt the need of a blockchain. If things could be easily accessible in the familiar web2, why do we need web3 for? The design nowadays is replacing database (the backend) with smart contracts; and it has nothing to do with the frontend. What displays to users is similar to web2, except with extra buttons to click (signing transactions), extra time to wait (confirming transactions in slower-finality-chain like Ethereum). There are no large-enough benefits that people could see using a blockchain technology if they could achieve the same in current day technology. NFT offers a unique collectible when booking a hotel, booking a flight, etc, and collect after it’s used, to remember where you had been to and what happy moments you’ve had. For myself, one doesn’t feel so. \n\nAn NFT is a viewable entity. Perhaps additionally, it’s listenable entity. Visual and audio. As a kinesthetic learner myself, it triggers only if it could be touched. Holding a ticket to a zoo with a close friend of mine, one feels the emotional attachment via the ticket to one’s friend. Collecting a chocolate box gifted by ones’ friends, one could take out each unexpirable unthrown wrapper, after eating the expirable chocolate, just enjoying its touch. A hug with a close friends worth more than half an hour of deep conversations, video call. A physical book enhances my senses from feeling asleep, to focus on reading the book. ***Certainly, an NFT can replace a physical collectible if others aren’t kinesthetic; but a lacking in sense of touch reduces its emotional impact especially to kinesthetic learners.*** If an physical object that triggers a deeper emotion, offering its sense of sight, smell, taste, hear, and touch; what’s the point choosing one lying on the web with less surface area, offering only sense of sight and hear? \n\nBlockchain aims for **transparency and immutability** at the very least. For victims to gated-data and mutable-histories, it strengthen their believes, that blockchain is the way, to change what’s available today. For oneself, whom have difficulty and refuses to work more than 40 hours per week (I’m looking for work btw) **and** a difficulty to get paid via banks, remote works + cryptocurrency is the way to change. Not for others. \n\nFor most people, perhaps they may dream of what they want to become, but end up as a normal worker. A normal worker nowadays are quite “busy”, and they don’t have time to think about what they want to become, or even climbing up the ladder of success, if there is one that they can climb. Someone numb to work, that work is only for the money, that we wish for something else outside of work, that we work for others ***because we refuse to think of what work we can do ourselves***, because we want someone to keep us responsible. Startups are rare: it follows more workers joining a startup than there are co-founders and founders of a startup. It follows that failed startups may continue to not giving up, or they join as workers to successful startups. So, co-founders and founders are rare. \n\nBlockchain is mostly remote work. Yes, you can pay people via blockchain, just like paying people via banks, for physical work. But what for? Ignore the fact that most shop don’t accept cryptocurrencies yet; even if they do, fiat currency does fine today. Most people can settle for the average and use fiat. If there are no intense fluctuations in currency, **especially in their local currency and not USD which most crypto-stablecoin pins to**, plus a countrywide mass adoption, they could interchangeably use crypto or fiat, depending on what they have. ***If people can don’t think about a choice, people choose to not think about them, for they want to focus their attention on something else that worth their attention****.* \n\nA choice between crypto and fiat isn’t worth layman’s attention. If their boss pays them in mass-adopted crypto, they use crypto. If their boss pays them in fiat, they just use fiat. Who wants to swap their fiat, except for crypto enthusiasts and researching individuals whom can prove that crypto benefits more than fiat, ***if they need to pay for swap fee?*** They already earn quite little, for most people below the US average earnings, and exchanges from crypto to fiat eats more from their barely-enough income? Even saving the extra 0.1% can cause a difference in their life circumstances. \n\nPayment in cryptocurrency are indeed easier. You can pay and receive anywhere, without worrying whether PayPal restrict your country from receiving payments, or you aren’t living in the 200+ countries supported. All you need is internet access. Furthermore, inserting a card detail during online payment is not easier than creating a wallet and sign a transaction; indeed the former is more difficult while the latter is a one-off. It’s similar to one-off setup PayPal, except with more benefits. Not every site supports PayPal either, like not every site supports cryptocurrency payment. ***If only buying crypto with fiat is that easy***. \n\nNot every of us is gritty (you read Angela Duckworth’s “Grit” book?): for an obstacle that takes too much attention and effort we’re willing to exert and overcome, we shall back up and give up. That’s for the average human. If we could pay something easier with bank transfer or PayPal, already readily supported, what’s the point of first trying (with tremendous effort) porting our money to crypto and make the payment? Especially if your country doesn’t support crypto to fiat (and vice versa) exchanges: and if you gone through annoying processes that involve governments (so many forms and fields in a form to fill, be it related or unrelated, necessary or unnecessary; and even so, things doesn’t process sufficiently fast hence a long wait or a noreply for too long), fiat is a government-issued currency, so similar process you might go through even if your country supports crypto-fiat exchanges. \n\nRemember, blockchain tries to solve a different problem. It’s not clear that the problem it tries to solve: transparency and immutability, is applicable to all of us. Sure, we do want transparency of how Facebook and Google and Amazon and Microsoft uses our data: we want to know if they misuse our data. For most of us though, we prefer **signing up with half-true-half-fake information**, so even if they misuse these information, it isn’t fatal. For unless you need the annoying KYC that triggers a nerve in most people’s vein, just entering information, be it true or fake, doesn’t affect much. Facebook don’t really care if you enter a fake Birthday; they trust you to be truthful with the information you send; but if you cannot trust them, don’t use your real information! They trust you not to touch adult content if you haven’t reach legal age: which with parent’s supervision, it’s more than sufficient to turn on a “safe-search” equivalent for their children. Oh, they use your data to train a machine learning model? Go ahead and train man, we don’t care. \n\nSee, without a specific cause, most people don’t have the time and attention to care how their data is being used. We created blockchain to raise awareness for those whom don’t care, that if they noticed in news or somewhere, they could join in and fight for how their data is used. But when they aren’t aware, which most aren’t nowadays; they *doubt* whether there’s a need for blockchain. Those caring about transparency holds responsibility for the rest of us whom don’t care a s\\*\\*t of how it’s used. As long as a person don’t feel treated unfairly, usually its a *none-of-their-business*. There are far too many things to care about, most just choose to ignore small things that aren’t in their priority list. ***Unless we built a sufficiently easy-to-use platform with extra benefits that they can migrate to with ease, people tend to use whatever they can now***. \n\nFor one, fluctuations is not a priority. Maybe it is for some people, not me. And, given how much of us procrastinate… If one person could continue using Chrome without interventing their lives, they won’t migrate to Brave. Wow, it’s easy to migrate to Brave, just two clicks to migrate the saved cookies, plus logging in again on Brave to all that wasn’t log in? Well, if one continues to use Chrome, one don’t have to go through the hassle of trying to remember a password that either save somewhere or maybe already forgotten hence requires clicking “Reset your password” button migrating to Brave. If one is someone whom loves to procrastinate, one wouldn’t want to go through even clicking to download Brave browser. 30 seconds setup is a lot of time which one could lay down in bed for 30 more seconds. Something that’s done once, enough is enough. Migration to something else means doing the “one-off” stuff once again. \n\n> Btw, one is using Brave browser lol. \n\nNowadays, blockchain adopters are crypto investors, crypto lovers, blockchain enthusiast (from end-users to developers to other sectors). It’s known that most people still doesn’t put a feet in blockchain’s water, with their fear, uncertainties, and doubts of what benefits blockchain can bring, **and whether they even need the benefits or they could live without it**. One is new to Mirror; but have you read articles on read.cash or publish0x? They’re flooded with “Bitcoin”, “Crypto”, “some kinds of altcoins”, and anything that’s related to “Finance”: which are just boring articles. Where are the articles talking about nature? Where are those talking about some music? Where are those talking about self-improvements? ***These other sectors are what makes Medium strong; and you expect a normal user, whom want to search for a new recipe they can cook tonight, but not available on Web3 blogging pages, to use web3***? \n\nAnd **crypto terms!!!** What is FUD, what is HODL, what is staking, what is proof-of-work? End users don’t care a s\\*\\*t about these terms!!! An interface or an article that uses too much of these terms only attract those who can understand it, and shock those whom cannot. The latter, if you try to convince them again in the future, would have a bad first impression preventing them from re-adoption. The use of new blockchain terms integrated into the web2 interface is not fascinating. The aim is ***designing something that even someone whom don’t watch the news (like me) can onboard***. For example, one don’t even know what’s ledger, and one thought that web3 is a website with 3-D effects, when one first heard about it last December. Expect to design some wallet with words that everyone could understand. \n\nAnd staking? It’s like a saving for banks “locked saving accounts”. Well, flexible savings is the way to go; locked isn’t. And what’s this: \n\n![NEAR (Protocol) Wallet selecting Validator to Stake with](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fymKbxNRNaWhxjyYLSg4Y.png?height=913&width=821)\n\nThis requires user research on which one are trustworthy. And how does banks does it? Well, just transfer into a saving account and the bank will do the backend stuffs, either lending your money to whoever it is or lending your money to whoever it is. (ahem, deliberately repeated.) Users should not care about who to delegate to: as end-users love someone professional to take responsibility for them, to stake their tokens to someone trustworthy, and that their tokens won’t be “slashed” (lost). This is an example of giving end-users too much choice. With too much choice comes too difficult its usage. That’s why Ruby on Rails onboard more amateur programmers: they don’t have to worry about what name to give to a database, and many more default values/names that they don’t need to care about (especially for one whom have difficulty creating good, understandable names). \n\nFor if we want to onboard users to use Web3, we could. We have taken the smooth steps so, when they onboard a web3 website, they see things that are familiar (web2) frontend and not even notice they’re using web3 technologies. For end users whom want to onboard the blockchain, something that they could easily find and takes “zero effort” to onboard is the way. Not something that they need to search deep into Google page 87 before finding it; not something that they need to pay for storage cost initially (as a fan of NEAR Protocol, this “initial storage cost requirement” is what one would say, prevent people from onboarding blockchain, unless there’s a friend to send them some onboarding money, which they not necessary have the courage to request for especially for introverts or shy-er people). Blockchain are for the majority: not the minority crypto investors, ***and it’s time to think how we can design that***. \n\n(photos taken from pexels or unsplash)", "timestamp": 1654323262, "digest": "hOcj4us7z7feZAf1R4ihLL-lT8RcDW5xYuotuWohNdQ", "contributor": "0xa32e05D545FEc9cADb46BEB0839E3Ac0A9E39d9B"}
{"id": "BdcIhHx4BJTOSnTvWJNo4v3CDho-s8JA62buQ6drjQ4", "title": "What Is Web3?", "body": "Do you remember the first time you heard about Bitcoin? Maybe it was a faint buzz about a new technology that would change everything. Perhaps you felt a tingle of FOMO as the folks who got in early suddenly amassed a small fortune — even if it wasn’t clear what the “money” could legitimately be spent on (really [expensive pizza](https://www.yahoo.com/video/bitcoin-pizza-day-sees-first-112000121.html)?). Maybe you just wondered whether your company should be working on a crypto strategy in case it *did* take off in your industry, even if you didn’t really care one way about it or the other.\n\nMost likely, soon after Bitcoin came to your attention — whenever that may have been — there was a crash. Every year or two, bitcoin’s value has tanked. Each time it does, skeptics rush to [dismiss it as dead](https://www.bitcoinisdead.org/), railing that it was always a scam for nerds and crooks and was nothing more than a fringe curiosity pushed by techno-libertarians and people who hate banks. Bitcoin never had a future alongside *real* tech companies, they’d contend, and then they’d forget about it and move on with their lives.\n\nAnd, of course, it would come back.\n\nBitcoin now seems to be everywhere. Amidst all the demands on our attention, many of us didn’t notice [cryptocurrencies](https://hbr.org/2022/05/web3-will-run-on-cryptocurrency) slowly seeping into the mainstream. Until suddenly [Larry David was pitching them during the Super Bowl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut3m9OK1c7Y); stars like Paris Hilton, Tom Brady, and Jamie Foxx were hawking them in ads; and a frankly terrifying [Wall Street–inspired robot bull celebrating cryptocurrency](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/04/miamis-wall-street-bull-is-a-crime-against-god.html) was unveiled in Miami. What was first a curiosity and then a speculative niche has become [big business](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/01/top-cryptocurrencies-performance-2021/).\n\n* [Thomas Stackpole](https://hbr.org/search?term=thomas%20stackpole&search_type=search-all) is a senior editor at Harvard Business Review.\n\nCrypto, however, is just the tip of the spear. The underlying technology, blockchain, is what’s called a “distributed ledger” — a database hosted by a network of computers instead of a single server — that offers users an immutable and transparent way to store information. Blockchain is now being deployed to new ends: for instance, to create “digital deed” ownership records of unique digital objects — or nonfungible tokens. NFTs have exploded in 2022, conjuring [a $41 billion market](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/nft-market-41-billion-nearing-fine-art-market-size-2022-1) seemingly out of thin air. Beeple, for example, caused a sensation last year when an NFT of his artwork sold for [$69 million at Christie’s](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million). Even more esoteric cousins, such as DAOs, or “[decentralized autonomous organizations](https://hbr.org/2022/05/what-a-dao-can-and-cant-do),” operate like headless corporations: They raise and spend money, but all decisions are voted on by members and executed by encoded rules. One DAO recently [raised $47 million in an attempt to buy a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790452/constitutiondao-loses-auction-for-rare-us-constitution-copy-sothebys). Advocates of [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) (or “decentralized finance,” which aims to [remake the global financial system](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/05/us/politics/cryptocurrency-explainer.html)) are [lobbying Congress](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2021/11/08/decentralized-finance-group-lobbies-up-798743) and [pitching a future without banks](https://fortune.com/2022/02/17/what-is-defi-banks-blockchain/).\n\nThe totality of these efforts is called “Web3.” The moniker is a convenient shorthand for the project of rewiring how the web works, using [blockchain](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain) to change how information is stored, shared, and owned. In theory, a blockchain-based web could shatter the monopolies on who controls information, who makes money, and even how networks and corporations work. Advocates argue that Web3 will create new economies, new classes of products, and new services online; that it will return democracy to the web; and that is going to define the next era of the internet. Like the Marvel villain Thanos, Web3 is inevitable.\n\n#### Welcome to Web3: Series reprint\n\n \n [buy copies](https://store.hbr.org/product/welcome-to-web3/bg2202?sku=BG2202-PDF-ENG)\n\nOr is it? While it’s undeniable that energy, money, and talent are surging into Web3 projects, remaking the web is a major undertaking. For all its promise, blockchain faces significant technical, environmental, ethical, and regulatory hurdles between here and hegemony. A growing chorus of skeptics warns that Web3 is rotten with speculation, theft, and privacy problems, and that the pull of centralization and the proliferation of new intermediaries is already undermining the utopian pitch for a decentralized web.\n\nMeanwhile, businesses and leaders are trying to make sense of the potential — and pitfalls — of a rapidly changing landscape that could pay serious dividends to organizations that get it right. Many companies are testing the Web3 waters, and while some have enjoyed major successes, several high-profile firms are [finding](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/canceled-gaming-nft-2022-2021/) that they (or [their customers](https://futurism.com/wwf-cancels-nft-project)) [don’t like](https://www.glossy.co/fashion/meundies-nfts-customer-backlash/) the temperature. Most people, of course, don’t even really know what Web3 is: In [a casual poll of HBR readers on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6905189041239584768/) in March 2022, almost 70% said they didn’t know what the term meant.\n\nWelcome to the confusing, contested, exciting, utopian, scam-ridden, disastrous, democratizing, (maybe) decentralized world of Web3. Here’s what you need to know.\n\n## Install Update: From Web1 to Web3\n\nTo put Web3 into context, let me offer a quick refresher.\n\n \n *Watch “The Explainer: What Is Web3?”*\n\nIn the beginning, there was the internet: the physical infrastructure of wires and servers that lets computers, and the people in front of them, talk to each other. The U.S. government’s ARPANET sent its first message in 1969, but the web as we know it today didn’t emerge until 1991, when HTML and URLs made it possible for users to navigate between static pages. Consider this the read-only web, or Web1.\n\nIn the early 2000s, things started to change. For one, the internet was becoming more interactive; it was an era of user-generated content, or the read/write web. Social media was a key feature of Web2 (or Web 2.0, as you may know it), and Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr came to define the experience of being online. YouTube, Wikipedia, and Google, along with the ability to comment on content, expanded our ability to watch, learn, search, and communicate.\n\nThe Web2 era has also been one of centralization. Network effects and economies of scale have led to clear winners, and those companies (many of which are listed above) have produced mind-boggling wealth for themselves and their shareholders by scraping users’ data and selling targeted ads against it. This has allowed services to be offered for “free,” though users initially didn’t understand the implications of that bargain. Web2 also created new ways for regular people to make money, such as through the sharing economy and the [sometimes lucrative](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-instagram-influencers-earn-examples-2021-6) job of [being an influencer](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/how-much-money-you-can-make-off-social-media-following-calculator.html).\n\nThere’s plenty to critique in the current system: The companies with concentrated or near-monopoly power have often failed to wield it responsibly, consumers who now realize that they *are* the product are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with ceding control of their personal data, and [it’s possible that](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/31/targeted-ads-offer-little-extra-value-for-online-publishers-study-suggests/) [the targeted-ad](https://www.wired.com/story/ad-tech-could-be-the-next-internet-bubble/) [economy ](https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/qa-tim-hwang-subprime-attention-crisis/)is a fragile bubble that does little to actually boost advertisers. As the web has grown up, centralized, and gone corporate, many have started to wonder whether there’s a better future out there.\n\nWhich brings us to Web3. Advocates of this vision are pitching it as a roots-deep update that will correct the problems and perverse incentives of Web2. Worried about privacy? Encrypted wallets protect your online identity. About censorship? A decentralized database stores everything immutably and transparently, preventing moderators from swooping in to delete offending content. Centralization? You get a real vote on decisions made by the networks you spend time on. More than that, you get a stake that’s *worth something* — you’re not a product, you’re an owner. This is the vision of the read/write/own web.\n\n## OK, but What Is Web3?\n\nThe seeds of what would become Web3 were planted in 1991, when scientists W. Scott Stornetta and Stuart Haber [launched](https://www.anf.es/pdf/Haber_Stornetta.pdf) [the first blockchain](https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5nzx4/what-was-the-first-blockchain) — a project to time-stamp digital documents. But the idea didn’t really take root until 2009, when [Bitcoin](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/training/annual-national-training-seminar/2018/Emerging_Tech_Bitcoin_Crypto.pdf) was launched in the wake of the financial crisis (and at least partially in response to it) by the pseudonymous inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. It and its undergirding blockchain technology work like this: Ownership of the cryptocurrency is tracked on a shared public ledger, and when one user wants to make a transfer, “miners” process the transaction by solving a complex math problem, adding a new “block” of data to the chain and earning newly created bitcoin for their efforts. While the Bitcoin chain is used just for currency, newer blockchains offer other options. Ethereum, which launched in 2015, is both a cryptocurrency and a platform that can be used to build other cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. Gavin Wood, one of its cofounders, [described](https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2016/04/ethereum-competitor-bitcoin-which-could-transform-entire-industries) Ethereum as “one computer for the entire planet,” with computing power distributed across the globe and controlled nowhere. Now, after more than a decade, proponents of a blockchain-based web are proclaiming that a new era — Web3 — has dawned.\n\nPut *very* simply, Web3 is an extension of cryptocurrency, using blockchain in new ways to new ends. A blockchain can store the number of tokens in a wallet, the terms of a self-executing contract, or the code for a decentralized app (dApp). Not all blockchains work the same way, but in general, coins are used as incentives for miners to process transactions. On “proof of work” chains like Bitcoin, solving the complex math problems necessary to process transactions is energy-intensive by design. On a “proof of stake” chain, which are newer but increasingly common, processing transactions simply requires that the verifiers with a stake in the chain agree that a transaction is legit — a process that’s significantly more efficient. In both cases, transaction data is public, though users’ wallets are identified only by a cryptographically generated address. Blockchains are “write only,” which means you can add data to them but can’t delete it.\n\nWeb3 and cryptocurrencies run on what are called “permissionless” blockchains, which have no centralized control and don’t require users to trust — or even know anything about — other users to do business with them. This is mostly what people are talking about when they say blockchain. “Web3 is the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens,” says Chris Dixon, a partner at the venture capital firm a16z and one of Web3’s foremost advocates and investors, borrowing the definition from Web3 adviser Packy McCormick. This is a big deal because it changes a foundational dynamic of today’s web, in which companies squeeze users for every bit of data they can. Tokens and shared ownership, Dixon says, fix “the core problem of centralized networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.”\n\n*Read a short Web3 glossary.*\n\nIn 2014, Ethereum’s Wood wrote a foundational blog post in which he sketched out his view of the new era. Web3 is a “reimagination of the sorts of things we already use the web for, but with a fundamentally different model for the interactions between parties,” he said. “Information that we assume to be public, we publish. Information that we assume to be agreed, we place on a consensus-ledger. Information that we assume to be private, we keep secret and never reveal.” In this vision, all communication is encrypted, and identities are hidden. “In short, we engineer the system to mathematically enforce our prior assumptions, since no government or organization can reasonably be trusted.”\n\nThe idea has evolved since then, and new use cases have started popping up. The Web3 streaming service Sound.xyz promises a better deal for artists. Blockchain-based games, like the Pokémon-esque [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), let users earn money as they play. So-called “stablecoins,” whose value is pegged to the dollar, the euro, or some other external reference, have been pitched as [upgrades to the global financial system](https://hbr.org/2021/08/stablecoins-and-the-future-of-money). And crypto has gained traction as a [solution for cross-border payments](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/09/crypto-remittances-are-a-lifeline-for-the-worlds-most-vulnerable/), especially for users in volatile environments.\n\n“Blockchain is a new type of computer,” Dixon tells me. Just like it took years to understand the extent to which PCs and smartphones transformed the way we use technology, blockchain has been in a long incubation phase. Now, he says, “I think we might be in the golden period of Web3, where all the entrepreneurs are entering.” Although the eye-popping price tags, like the Beeple sale, have garnered much of the attention, there’s more to the story. “The vast majority of what I’m seeing is smaller-dollar things that are much more around communities,” he notes, like Sound.xyz. Whereas scale has been a key measure of a Web2 company, engagement is a better indicator of what might succeed in Web3.\n\nDixon is betting big on this future. He and a16z started putting money into the space in 2013 and invested [$2.2 billion](https://a16z.com/2021/06/24/crypto-fund-iii/) in Web3 companies last year. He is looking [to double that](https://www.ft.com/content/6bf0ed56-1de5-4750-877f-c9cff753935c) in 2022. The number of active developers working on Web3 code [nearly doubled](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d) in 2021, to roughly 18,000 — not huge, considering global numbers, but notable nonetheless. Perhaps most significantly, Web3 projects have become part of the zeitgeist, and the buzz is undeniable.\n\nBut as high-profile, self-immolating startups like Theranos and WeWork remind us, buzz isn’t everything. So what happens next? And what should you watch out for?\n\n## What Web3 Might Mean for Companies\n\nWeb3 will have a few key differences from Web2: Users won’t need separate log-ins for every site they visit but instead will use a centralized identity (probably their crypto wallet) that carries their information. They’ll have more control over the sites they visit, as they earn or buy tokens that allow them to vote on decisions or unlock functionality.\n\nIt’s still unclear whether the product lives up to the pitch. Predictions as to what Web3 might look like at scale are just guesses, but some projects have grown pretty big. The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), NBA Top Shot, and the cryptogaming giant Dapper Labs have built successful NFT communities. Clearinghouses such as Coinbase (for buying, selling, and storing cryptocurrency) and OpenSea (the largest digital marketplace for crypto collectibles and NFTs) have created Web3 on-ramps for people with little to no technical know-how.\n\nWhile companies such as Microsoft, Overstock, and PayPal have [accepted cryptocurrencies](https://www.yahoo.com/video/10-major-companies-accept-bitcoin-190340692.html) for years, [NFTs](https://hbr.org/2021/11/how-nfts-create-value) — which have recently exploded in popularity — are the primary way brands are now experimenting with Web3. Practically speaking, an NFT is some mix of a deed, a certificate of authenticity, and a membership card. It can confer “ownership” of digital art (typically, ownership is recorded on the blockchain and a link points to an image somewhere) or rights or access to a group. NFTs can operate on a smaller scale than coins because they create their own ecosystems and require nothing more than a community of people who find value in the project. For example, baseball cards are valuable only to certain collectors, but that group *really* believes in their value.\n\n \n *Listen to our Spotify playlist on Web3 & finance.*\n\nMost successful [forays by traditional companies](https://hbr.org/2022/02/how-your-brand-should-use-nfts) into Web3 have been ones that create communities or plug in to existing ones. Consider the NBA: Top Shot was one of the first NFT projects from a legacy brand, and it offered fans the opportunity to buy and trade clips, called “moments” (a [LeBron James dunk](https://nbatopshot.com/moment/kyloren+5408a71c-50f1-4588-86e3-354b40519ce3), for instance), that function like trading cards. It took off because it created a new kind of community space for fans, many of whom may have already been collecting basketball cards. Other front-runner brands, such as [Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-adidas-nft-sneakers-11642160548), similarly added a digital layer to their existing collector communities. All three companies offer NFTs that can be used in the virtual world — for example, allowing the owner to [gear up an avatar](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nike-metaverse-rtfkt-nikeland-roblox-nft/) — or that confer rights to products or [exclusive streetwear drops](https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22822143/adidas-nft-launch-into-the-metaverse-price-release-date) in the real world. Adidas sold $23 million worth of NFTs in less than a day and instantly created a resale market on OpenSea, just like what you might see after a limited drop of new shoes. Similarly, [Time magazine launched an NFT project](https://time.com/6100404/timepieces-nft-collection/) to build an online community that leverages the publication’s deep history.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club is the biggest success story of an NFT project going mainstream. Combining hype and exclusivity, BAYC offers access to real-life parties and to online spaces, along with usage rights to the ape’s image — further reinforcing the brand. An ape NFT puts the owner in an exclusive club, both figuratively and literally.\n\nOne lesson from these efforts is that on-ramps matter, but less so the more committed the community is. Getting a crypto wallet isn’t hard, but it is an added step. So Top Shot doesn’t require a one — users can just plug in their credit card — which helped it acquire interested users new to NFTs. The Bored Ape Yacht Club was a niche interest, but when it took off, it became a catalyst for people to create wallets and drove interest in OpenSea.\n\nSome companies have had rockier experiences with NFT projects and crytpo features. For example, when Jason Citron, the CEO of Discord, a voice, video, and text communication service, teased a feature that could connect the app to crypto wallets, Discord users mutinied, leading him to [clarify](https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699?s=20&t=0Ttlg7NT0Ur78oprboSniw) that the company had “no current plans” to launch the tie-in. The underwear brand MeUndies and the UK branch of the World Wildlife Fund both [quickly pulled](https://www.glossy.co/fashion/meundies-nfts-customer-backlash/) [the plug](https://futurism.com/wwf-cancels-nft-project) on NFT projects after a fierce backlash by customers furious about their [sizable carbon footprint](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change). Even the success stories have hit bumps in the road. Nike is currently fighting to have unauthorized NFTs “destroyed,” and OpenSea is full of knockoffs and imitators. Given that blockchain is immutable, this is [raising novel legal questions](https://decrypt.co/96456/nike-destroy-unauthorized-nfts-how-will-that-work), and [it isn’t clear](https://www.wired.com/story/opensea-nfts-twitter/) how companies will handle the issue. Further, there’s [recent evidence that the market for NFTs is stalling entirely](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nft-sales-are-flatlining-11651552616).\n\nCompanies who are considering stepping into this space should remember this: Web3 is polarizing, and there are no guarantees. Amid many points of disagreement, the chief divide is between people who believe in what Web3 *could* be and critics who decry the many problems dogging it right now.\n\n## System Error: The Case Against Web3\n\nThe early days of a technology are a heady time. The possibilities are endless, and there’s a focus on what it can do — or *will* do, according to optimists. I’m old enough to remember when the unfettered discourse enabled by Twitter and Facebook was supposed to sow democracy the world over. As Web3’s aura of inevitability (and profitability) wins converts, it’s important to consider what could go wrong and recognize what’s *already* going wrong.\n\n### It’s rife with speculation.\n\nSkeptics argue that for all the rhetoric about democratization, ownership opportunities, and mass wealth building, Web3 is nothing more than a giant speculative economy that will mostly make some already-rich people even richer. It’s easy to see why this argument makes sense. The top 0.01% of bitcoin holders [own 27% of the supply](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoins-one-percent-controls-lions-share-of-the-cryptocurrencys-wealth-11639996204). Wash trading, or selling assets to yourself, and [market manipulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304393217301666) have been reported in both [crypto](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3362153) and [NFT markets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-05/hottest-nft-marketplace-is-mostly-users-selling-to-themselves?sref=gKSeqgQQ), artificially pumping up value and allowing owners to earn coins through sham trades. In an interview on the podcast *The Dig,* reporters Edward Ongweso Jr. and Jacob Silverman characterized the whole system as an [elaborate upward transfer of wealth](https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/cryptocurrency-w-edward-ongweso-jr-jacob-silverman/). Writing in The Atlantic, investor Rex Woodbury called Web3 “[the financialization of everything](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/financialization-everything-investment-system-token/620804/)” (and not in a good way). On a more granular level, [Molly White](https://hbr.org/2022/05/cautionary-tales-from-cryptoland), a software engineer, created [Web3 Is Going Just Great](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/), where she tracks the many hacks, scams, and implosions in the Web3 world, underscoring the pitfalls of the unregulated, Wild West territory.\n\nMagdiel Lopez/Belmont Creative\n\nThe unpredictable, speculative nature of the markets may be a feature, not a bug. According to technologist David Rosenthal, speculation on cryptocurrencies is the engine that drives Web3 — that it can’t work without it. “\\[A\\] permissionless blockchain *requires* a cryptocurrency to function, and this cryptocurrency *requires* speculation to function,” he [said in a talk](https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/ee380-talk.html) at Stanford in early 2022. Basically, he’s describing a pyramid scheme: Blockchains need to give people something in exchange for volunteering computing power, and cryptocurrencies fill that role — but the system works only if other people are willing to buy them believing that they’ll be worth more in the future. Stephen Diehl, a technologist and vocal critic of Web3, [floridly dismissed](https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/web3-bullshit.html) blockchain as “a one-trick pony whose only application is creating censorship-resistant crypto investment schemes, an invention whose negative externalities and capacity for harm vastly outweigh any possible uses.”\n\n### The tech isn’t practical (and it’s expensive).\n\nQuestions abound as to whether Web3 — or blockchain, really — makes sense as the technology that will define the web’s next era. “Whether or not you agree with the philosophy/economics behind cryptocurrencies, they are — simply put — a software architecture disaster in the making,” says [Grady Booch](https://mobile.twitter.com/techgirl1908/status/1501216120707162118), chief scientist for software engineering at IBM Research. All technology comes with trade-offs, Booch explained in a [Twitter Spaces conversation](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1DXxyDVRBjvJM?s=20), and the cost of a “trustless” system is that it’s highly inefficient, capable of processing only a few transactions per minute — tiny amounts of data compared with a centralized system like, say, Amazon Web Services. Decentralization makes technology more complicated and further out of reach for basic users, rather than simpler and more accessible.\n\nWhile it’s possible to fix this by adding new layers that can speed things up, doing so makes the whole system more centralized, which defeats the purpose. Moxie Marlinspike, founder of the encrypted messaging app Signal, put it this way: “Once a distributed ecosystem centralizes around a platform for convenience, it becomes the worst of both worlds: centralized control, but still distributed enough to become mired in time.”\n\nRight now, the inefficiency of blockchain [comes at a cost](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/22/ethereums-fees-are-too-damn-high/), quite literally. Transaction costs on [Bitcoin and Ethereum](https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-and-its-many-fees-what-to-know-about-the-hidden-costs-of-digital-currency-11639825202) (which calls them gas fees) can run anywhere from a few bucks to hundreds of dollars. Storing one megabyte of data on a blockchain distributed ledger [can cost thousands, or even tens of thousands, of dollars](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/costs-storing-data-blockchain-rohan-pinto/) — yes, you read that correctly. That’s why the NFT you bought probably isn’t actually on a blockchain. The code on the chain indicating your ownership includes an address, pointing to where the image is stored. Which can [and has](https://www.protocol.com/fintech/frosties-nft-rug-pull) caused problems, including your pricy purchase [disappearing](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs) if the server it *actually* lives on goes down.\n\n### It enables harassment and abuse.\n\nThe potential for disastrous unintended consequences is very real. “While blockchain proponents speak about a ‘future of the web’ based around public ledgers, anonymity, and immutability,” [writes](https://blog.mollywhite.net/abuse-and-harassment-on-the-blockchain/) Molly White, “those of us who have been harassed online look on in horror as obvious vectors for harassment and abuse are overlooked, if not outright touted as features.” Although crypto wallets theoretically provide anonymity, the fact that transactions are public means that they can be traced back to individuals. (The FBI is [pretty good at doing this](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/technology/bitcoin-untraceable-pipeline-ransomware.html), which is why crypto isn’t great for criminal enterprise.) “Imagine if, when you Venmo-ed your Tinder date for your half of the meal, they could now see every other transaction you’d ever made,” including with other dates, your therapist, and the corner store by your house. That information in the hands of an abusive ex-partner or a stalker could be life-threatening.\n\nThe immutability of the blockchain also means that data can’t be taken down. There’s no way to erase anything, whether it’s a regrettable post or revenge porn. Immutability also could spell major problems for Web3 in some places, such as Europe, where the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [enshrines the right](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/) to have personal data erased.\n\n### It’s currently terrible for the environment.\n\nWeb3’s environmental impact is vast and deeply damaging. It can be broken into two categories: energy use and tech waste, both of which are products of mining. Running a network that depends on supercomputers competing to solve complex equations every time you want to save data on a blockchain takes a tremendous amount of energy. It also generates e-waste: According to Rosenthal, Bitcoin produces “an average of one whole MacBook Air of e-waste per ‘economically meaningful’ transaction” as miners cycle through quantities of short-lived computer hardware. The [research he bases this claim on](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921344921005103?via%3Dihub), by Alex de Vries and Christian Stoll, found that the annual e-waste created by Bitcoin is comparable to the amount produced by a country the size of the Netherlands.\n\nSubscribe to our Bimonthly Newsletter\n\nThe Big Idea\n\nA special series on the most pressing topics facing business today.\n\n[Sign Up](https://hbr.org/2022/05/what-is-web3#)\n\nWhether and how these issues will be addressed is hard to say, in part because it’s still unclear whether Web3 will really catch on. Blockchain is a technology in search of a real use, says technology writer Evgeny Morozov. “The business model of most Web3 ventures is self-referential in the extreme, feeding off people’s faith in the inevitable transition from Web 2.0 to Web3.” Tim O’Reilly, who coined “Web 2.0” to describe the platform web of the early 2000s, [claims](https://www.fastcompany.com/90716841/tim-oreilly-on-web3) that we’re in an investment boom reminiscent of the dot-com era before the bottom fell out. “Web 2.0 was not a version number, it was the second coming of the web after the dot-com bust,” he says. “I don’t think we’re going to be able to call Web3 ‘Web3’ until after the crypto bust. Because only then will we get to see what’s stuck around.”\n\nIf that’s true, then innovation is going to come at significant cost. As Hilary Allen, an American University law professor who studies the 2008 financial crisis, points out, the system now “mirrors and magnifies the fragilities of shadow banking innovations that resulted in the 2008 financial crisis.” If the Web3 bubble bursts, it could leave a lot of folks high and dry.\n\n## Early Days Are Here Again\n\nSo, where exactly is Web3 headed? Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin has [expressed concerns](https://time.com/6158182/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-profile/) about the direction his creation has taken but continues to be optimistic. In a response to Marlinspike on the Ethereum [Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ryk3it/my_first_impressions_of_web3/hrrz15r/) page, he conceded that the Signal founder presented “a correct criticism of the *current state* of the ecosystem” but maintained that the decentralized web is catching up, and pretty quickly at that. The work being done now — creating libraries of code — will soon make it easier for other developers to start working on Web3 projects. “I think the properly authenticated decentralized blockchain world is coming and is much closer to being here than many people think.”\n\nFor one, proof of work — the inefficient-by-design system Bitcoin and Ethereum run on — is falling out of vogue. Instead of mining, which uses intensive amounts of energy, validation increasingly comes from users buying in (owning a stake) to approve transactions. Ethereum estimates that the update to proof of stake will [cut its energy usage by 99.95%](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/), while making the platform faster and more efficient. Solana, a newer blockchain that uses proof of stake and “proof of history,” a mechanism that relies on time stamps, can process 65,000 transactions per second (compared with Ethereum’s current rate of about [15 per second](https://blog.coinbase.com/scaling-ethereum-crypto-for-a-billion-users-715ce15afc0b) and Bitcoin’s seven) and uses about as much energy as [two Google searches](https://solana.com/news/solana-foundation-carbon-neutral-2021) — consumption it buys carbon offsets for.\n\nSome companies are adopting a hybrid approach to blockchain, which offers the benefits without the constraints. “There are a lot of really interesting new architectures, which put certain things on the blockchain but not others,” he tells me. A social network, for instance, could record your followers and who you follow on the blockchain, but not your posts, giving you the option to delete them.\n\nHybrid models can also help companies address GDPR and other regulations. “To comply with the right to erasure,” explain Cindy Compert, Maurizio Luinetti, and Bertrand Portier in [an IBM white paper](https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/blockchain_and_gdpr.pdf), “personal data should be kept private from the blockchain in an ‘off-chain’ data store, with only its evidence (cryptographic hash) exposed to the chain.” That way, personal data can be deleted in keeping with GDPR without affecting the chain.\n\nFor better or worse, regulation is coming — slowly — and it will define the next chapter of Web3. China has [banned cryptocurrencies outright](https://fortune.com/2022/01/04/crypto-banned-china-other-countries/), along with Algeria, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, and Tunisia. Europe is considering environmental regulations that would [curb or ban proof-of-work blockchains](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-12/eu-near-vote-on-new-regulatory-framework-for-cryptocurrencies?sref=gKSeqgQQ). In the U.S., the Biden administration [issued an executive order](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/us/politics/crypto-regulation-biden.html) in March directing the federal government to look into regulating cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith so much of Web3 still being hashed out, it remains a high-risk, high-reward bet. Certain companies and sectors have more incentive than others to try their luck, particularly those that got burned by being left out in earlier eras of the web. It’s not a coincidence that a media company like Time is interested in the opportunities of Web3 after Web2 decimated its business model. Other organizations — like Nike and the NBA, which already have experience with limited drops and commoditizing moments — may have simply found that their business models are an easy fit. Other businesses won’t have as clear a path.\n\nThe soaring claims around Web3 — that it will take over the internet, upend the financial system, redistribute wealth, and make the web democratic again — should be taken with a grain of salt. We’ve heard all this before, and we’ve seen how earlier episodes of Web3 euphoria fizzled. But that doesn’t mean it should be written off entirely. Maybe it booms, maybe it busts, but we’ll be living with some form of it either way. What version — and how your company responds — could determine the future of the digital economy and what life online looks like for the next internet epoch. For now, that future is still up for grabs. Nothing, after all, is inevitable.", "timestamp": 1654323158, "digest": "A3Gphfka8UoS0FU9T90HJ-y_jgTxhJw7vS6YQE_Gc4c", "contributor": "0xE3B5993160feD0bcd133ae370231d9bf7DEfEC3b"}

{"id": "WpU96pw7xEeCARg-wRNY_5QG_u1lwO2xqeCCRrmS-_w", "title": "What Concerns to End Users have on Blockchain and Crypto", "body": "Why do users restrain from using blockchain? **Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubts.** \n\nInternet have scams and frauds, but still a lot of users use it, because it offers a far greater benefits than without it. It not only goes through a stage overcoming fear, uncertainties, and doubts, but also goes through a stage where, without it, people feel “they can’t live anymore.” Internet creates a dependency where its users depends on it. Its users are mostly addicted to it. We can see, with terms like “internet sabbaticals”, “restricting internet access time” coming up days to days. How does people restraint from using web3? \n\nFear, uncertainties, and doubts. While there exist internet banking today, various precautions and safety are in place that provides a safe haven for users to use. By safe haven, one don’t mean somewhere that’s absolutely safe. Password digest transferred through the internet isn’t absolutely safe, nor are password saved inside a database risk being hacked. A safe haven is somewhere where users find their community, where users can stop worrying about the various headaches of forgetting their passwords, of the security, etc. ***It’s something more emotional than logical***. \n\nConsidering blockchain. We assign the responsibility of each users to themselves, that they would keep their ledger safe, that they would keep their secure passphrase safe, that they won’t forget what their secure passphrase is. Not every users know how to put their password in Excel and encrypt their Excel file. Not every users have the thoughts of backing things up. And as a human, if we can stop worrying about something and assign that responsibility to somebody else, we tend to. ***We’re in favor of someone holding responsibility for us, so when things goes wrong, we can blame them than ourselves.*** It’s their fault, not ours, to lose our stuffs. We have something more important to care about, and we had already reassign these attention-demanding passwords and security to some experts and trustible entity to keep them for us. Blockchain tries to assign the responsibility back to the users that causes upheaval: a fear that they would lose their password and no one to back them up, no one there to help them, and they are in the water themselves, no one to save them. \n\nHuman lives as a team, a group, a collective beings. For most of us, we derive our security from external situations: either it be some materials, or another human being, usually someone close to us. It’s a miracle for us, deriving security from external circumstances, to take responsibility for ourselves, which derives internal security (or assigning security to our Gods), to keep something secure ourselves, without a “Forget your Password?” button to back things up. \n\nEnd users doubt the need of a blockchain. If things could be easily accessible in the familiar web2, why do we need web3 for? The design nowadays is replacing database (the backend) with smart contracts; and it has nothing to do with the frontend. What displays to users is similar to web2, except with extra buttons to click (signing transactions), extra time to wait (confirming transactions in slower-finality-chain like Ethereum). There are no large-enough benefits that people could see using a blockchain technology if they could achieve the same in current day technology. NFT offers a unique collectible when booking a hotel, booking a flight, etc, and collect after it’s used, to remember where you had been to and what happy moments you’ve had. For myself, one doesn’t feel so. \n\nAn NFT is a viewable entity. Perhaps additionally, it’s listenable entity. Visual and audio. As a kinesthetic learner myself, it triggers only if it could be touched. Holding a ticket to a zoo with a close friend of mine, one feels the emotional attachment via the ticket to one’s friend. Collecting a chocolate box gifted by ones’ friends, one could take out each unexpirable unthrown wrapper, after eating the expirable chocolate, just enjoying its touch. A hug with a close friends worth more than half an hour of deep conversations, video call. A physical book enhances my senses from feeling asleep, to focus on reading the book. ***Certainly, an NFT can replace a physical collectible if others aren’t kinesthetic; but a lacking in sense of touch reduces its emotional impact especially to kinesthetic learners.*** If an physical object that triggers a deeper emotion, offering its sense of sight, smell, taste, hear, and touch; what’s the point choosing one lying on the web with less surface area, offering only sense of sight and hear? \n\nBlockchain aims for **transparency and immutability** at the very least. For victims to gated-data and mutable-histories, it strengthen their believes, that blockchain is the way, to change what’s available today. For oneself, whom have difficulty and refuses to work more than 40 hours per week (I’m looking for work btw) **and** a difficulty to get paid via banks, remote works + cryptocurrency is the way to change. Not for others. \n\nFor most people, perhaps they may dream of what they want to become, but end up as a normal worker. A normal worker nowadays are quite “busy”, and they don’t have time to think about what they want to become, or even climbing up the ladder of success, if there is one that they can climb. Someone numb to work, that work is only for the money, that we wish for something else outside of work, that we work for others ***because we refuse to think of what work we can do ourselves***, because we want someone to keep us responsible. Startups are rare: it follows more workers joining a startup than there are co-founders and founders of a startup. It follows that failed startups may continue to not giving up, or they join as workers to successful startups. So, co-founders and founders are rare. \n\nBlockchain is mostly remote work. Yes, you can pay people via blockchain, just like paying people via banks, for physical work. But what for? Ignore the fact that most shop don’t accept cryptocurrencies yet; even if they do, fiat currency does fine today. Most people can settle for the average and use fiat. If there are no intense fluctuations in currency, **especially in their local currency and not USD which most crypto-stablecoin pins to**, plus a countrywide mass adoption, they could interchangeably use crypto or fiat, depending on what they have. ***If people can don’t think about a choice, people choose to not think about them, for they want to focus their attention on something else that worth their attention****.* \n\nA choice between crypto and fiat isn’t worth layman’s attention. If their boss pays them in mass-adopted crypto, they use crypto. If their boss pays them in fiat, they just use fiat. Who wants to swap their fiat, except for crypto enthusiasts and researching individuals whom can prove that crypto benefits more than fiat, ***if they need to pay for swap fee?*** They already earn quite little, for most people below the US average earnings, and exchanges from crypto to fiat eats more from their barely-enough income? Even saving the extra 0.1% can cause a difference in their life circumstances. \n\nPayment in cryptocurrency are indeed easier. You can pay and receive anywhere, without worrying whether PayPal restrict your country from receiving payments, or you aren’t living in the 200+ countries supported. All you need is internet access. Furthermore, inserting a card detail during online payment is not easier than creating a wallet and sign a transaction; indeed the former is more difficult while the latter is a one-off. It’s similar to one-off setup PayPal, except with more benefits. Not every site supports PayPal either, like not every site supports cryptocurrency payment. ***If only buying crypto with fiat is that easy***. \n\nNot every of us is gritty (you read Angela Duckworth’s “Grit” book?): for an obstacle that takes too much attention and effort we’re willing to exert and overcome, we shall back up and give up. That’s for the average human. If we could pay something easier with bank transfer or PayPal, already readily supported, what’s the point of first trying (with tremendous effort) porting our money to crypto and make the payment? Especially if your country doesn’t support crypto to fiat (and vice versa) exchanges: and if you gone through annoying processes that involve governments (so many forms and fields in a form to fill, be it related or unrelated, necessary or unnecessary; and even so, things doesn’t process sufficiently fast hence a long wait or a noreply for too long), fiat is a government-issued currency, so similar process you might go through even if your country supports crypto-fiat exchanges. \n\nRemember, blockchain tries to solve a different problem. It’s not clear that the problem it tries to solve: transparency and immutability, is applicable to all of us. Sure, we do want transparency of how Facebook and Google and Amazon and Microsoft uses our data: we want to know if they misuse our data. For most of us though, we prefer **signing up with half-true-half-fake information**, so even if they misuse these information, it isn’t fatal. For unless you need the annoying KYC that triggers a nerve in most people’s vein, just entering information, be it true or fake, doesn’t affect much. Facebook don’t really care if you enter a fake Birthday; they trust you to be truthful with the information you send; but if you cannot trust them, don’t use your real information! They trust you not to touch adult content if you haven’t reach legal age: which with parent’s supervision, it’s more than sufficient to turn on a “safe-search” equivalent for their children. Oh, they use your data to train a machine learning model? Go ahead and train man, we don’t care. \n\nSee, without a specific cause, most people don’t have the time and attention to care how their data is being used. We created blockchain to raise awareness for those whom don’t care, that if they noticed in news or somewhere, they could join in and fight for how their data is used. But when they aren’t aware, which most aren’t nowadays; they *doubt* whether there’s a need for blockchain. Those caring about transparency holds responsibility for the rest of us whom don’t care a s\\*\\*t of how it’s used. As long as a person don’t feel treated unfairly, usually its a *none-of-their-business*. There are far too many things to care about, most just choose to ignore small things that aren’t in their priority list. ***Unless we built a sufficiently easy-to-use platform with extra benefits that they can migrate to with ease, people tend to use whatever they can now***. \n\nFor one, fluctuations is not a priority. Maybe it is for some people, not me. And, given how much of us procrastinate… If one person could continue using Chrome without interventing their lives, they won’t migrate to Brave. Wow, it’s easy to migrate to Brave, just two clicks to migrate the saved cookies, plus logging in again on Brave to all that wasn’t log in? Well, if one continues to use Chrome, one don’t have to go through the hassle of trying to remember a password that either save somewhere or maybe already forgotten hence requires clicking “Reset your password” button migrating to Brave. If one is someone whom loves to procrastinate, one wouldn’t want to go through even clicking to download Brave browser. 30 seconds setup is a lot of time which one could lay down in bed for 30 more seconds. Something that’s done once, enough is enough. Migration to something else means doing the “one-off” stuff once again. \n\n> Btw, one is using Brave browser lol. \n\nNowadays, blockchain adopters are crypto investors, crypto lovers, blockchain enthusiast (from end-users to developers to other sectors). It’s known that most people still doesn’t put a feet in blockchain’s water, with their fear, uncertainties, and doubts of what benefits blockchain can bring, **and whether they even need the benefits or they could live without it**. One is new to Mirror; but have you read articles on read.cash or publish0x? They’re flooded with “Bitcoin”, “Crypto”, “some kinds of altcoins”, and anything that’s related to “Finance”: which are just boring articles. Where are the articles talking about nature? Where are those talking about some music? Where are those talking about self-improvements? ***These other sectors are what makes Medium strong; and you expect a normal user, whom want to search for a new recipe they can cook tonight, but not available on Web3 blogging pages, to use web3***? \n\nAnd **crypto terms!!!** What is FUD, what is HODL, what is staking, what is proof-of-work? End users don’t care a s\\*\\*t about these terms!!! An interface or an article that uses too much of these terms only attract those who can understand it, and shock those whom cannot. The latter, if you try to convince them again in the future, would have a bad first impression preventing them from re-adoption. The use of new blockchain terms integrated into the web2 interface is not fascinating. The aim is ***designing something that even someone whom don’t watch the news (like me) can onboard***. For example, one don’t even know what’s ledger, and one thought that web3 is a website with 3-D effects, when one first heard about it last December. Expect to design some wallet with words that everyone could understand. \n\nAnd staking? It’s like a saving for banks “locked saving accounts”. Well, flexible savings is the way to go; locked isn’t. And what’s this: \n\n![NEAR (Protocol) Wallet selecting Validator to Stake with](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fymKbxNRNaWhxjyYLSg4Y.png?height=913&width=821)\n\nThis requires user research on which one are trustworthy. And how does banks does it? Well, just transfer into a saving account and the bank will do the backend stuffs, either lending your money to whoever it is or lending your money to whoever it is. (ahem, deliberately repeated.) Users should not care about who to delegate to: as end-users love someone professional to take responsibility for them, to stake their tokens to someone trustworthy, and that their tokens won’t be “slashed” (lost). This is an example of giving end-users too much choice. With too much choice comes too difficult its usage. That’s why Ruby on Rails onboard more amateur programmers: they don’t have to worry about what name to give to a database, and many more default values/names that they don’t need to care about (especially for one whom have difficulty creating good, understandable names). \n\nFor if we want to onboard users to use Web3, we could. We have taken the smooth steps so, when they onboard a web3 website, they see things that are familiar (web2) frontend and not even notice they’re using web3 technologies. For end users whom want to onboard the blockchain, something that they could easily find and takes “zero effort” to onboard is the way. Not something that they need to search deep into Google page 87 before finding it; not something that they need to pay for storage cost initially (as a fan of NEAR Protocol, this “initial storage cost requirement” is what one would say, prevent people from onboarding blockchain, unless there’s a friend to send them some onboarding money, which they not necessary have the courage to request for especially for introverts or shy-er people). Blockchain are for the majority: not the minority crypto investors, ***and it’s time to think how we can design that***. \n\n(photos taken from pexels or unsplash)", "timestamp": 1654323356, "digest": "w8MStA6gTkA-o4fme-eaqlTYBTNnW51f1cQhfqCOiDc", "contributor": "0xa32e05D545FEc9cADb46BEB0839E3Ac0A9E39d9B"}

{"id": "ub-2QmGjAsH-QnAzkP0O5PGG_qYMo4NQ5em_Hbgg0oM", "title": "Why Do Bitcoins Have Value?", "body": "Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is often referred to as digital currency and as an alternative to central bank-controlled [fiat money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp). However, the latter is valuable because it is issued by a monetary authority and is widely used in an economy. Bitcoin's network is decentralized, and the [cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp) is not used much in retail transactions.\n\nOne can argue that[ Bitcoin's value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp) is similar to that of [precious metals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preciousmetal.asp). Both are limited in quantity and have select use cases. Precious metals like gold are used in industrial applications, while Bitcoin's underlying technology, the [blockchain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp), has some applications across the financial services industries. Bitcoin's digital provenance means that it might even serve as a medium for retail transactions one day.\n\n### KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n* Currencies have value because they can function as a store of value and a unit of exchange. They also demonstrate six key attributes to enable their use in an economy.\n* The definition of value in a currency has changed over centuries from physical attributes to the velocity of its use in an economy.\n* Bitcoin demonstrates some attributes for a currency, but its main source of value lies in its restricted supply and increasing demand.\n* If the price of one bitcoin were to reach $514,000, Bitcoin's market capitalization would reach approximately 15% of the global currency market.\n\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 53 secondsVolume 75%\n\n \n\n1:53\n\n#### Click Play to Learn Why Bitcoins Have Value\n\n## Why Traditional Currencies Have Value\n\nThere are six key attributes to a useful currency: scarcity, divisibility, acceptability, portability, durability, and resistance to counterfeiting (uniformity). These qualities allow a currency to find widespread use in an economy. They also limit monetary [inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp) and ensure that the currencies are secure and safe to use.\n\nCurrency is useful if it works as a [store of value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/storeofvalue.asp) or, to put it differently, if it can reliably maintain its relative value over time. Throughout history, many societies used [commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp) or [precious metals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preciousmetal.asp) as methods of payment because they were considered to have a relatively stable value.\n\nRather than carry around cumbersome quantities of cocoa beans, gold, or other early forms of money, societies eventually turned to minted currency as an alternative. The first such currencies used metals like gold, silver, and bronze, which had long shelf lives and little risk of depreciation.1\n\nAssigning value to currencies is a matter of debate. Initially, their value came from intrinsic physical properties. For example, gold's value comes from the costs of extraction and certain qualitative factors, such as luster and purity content.\n\nIn the modern age, government-issued currencies often take the form of paper money, which does not have the same intrinsic scarcity as precious metals. For a long time, the value of paper money was determined by the amount of gold backing it. Even today, some currencies are \"[representative](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041615/what-difference-between-fiat-money-and-representative-money.asp#:\\~:text=Representative%20money%20is%20government%2Dproduced,like%20checks%20and%20credit%20cards.),\" meaning that each coin or note can be directly exchanged for a specified amount of a commodity.\n\nThe idea of a currency's value began changing in the 17th century. Prominent Scottish economist John Law wrote that money—currency issued by a government or monarch—\"is not the value for which goods are exchanged, but the value by which they are exchanged.\"2 In other words, the value of a currency is a measure of its demand and its ability to stimulate trade and business within and outside an economy.\n\nThis thinking hews closely to the modern credit theory for monetary systems. In this theory, commercial banks create money (and value for currencies) by lending to borrowers, who use the money to purchase goods and cause currency to circulate in an economy.\n\nAfter countries [abandoned the gold standard](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp) in an effort to curb concerns about gold supplies, many global currencies are now classified as fiat.3 Fiat currency is issued by a government and not backed by any commodity, but rather by the faith that individuals and governments have that others will accept that currency.\n\nToday, most major global currencies are fiat. Many governments and societies have found that fiat currency is the most durable and least susceptible to loss of value over time.4 The value of fiat currencies is a function of their demand and supply. The U.S. dollar is considered valuable because the world's biggest economy uses it and it dominates the flow of payments in international trade. \n \n\n## The Value of Digital Currencies\n\nAny discussion about the value of Bitcoin must address the nature of currency. Gold was useful as currency due to its inherent physical attributes, but it was also cumbersome. Paper money was an improvement, but it requires manufacturing and storage and lacks the mobility of digital currencies. The digital evolution of money has moved away from physical attributes, and towards more functional characteristics.\n\nHere's an example. During the financial crisis, Ben Bernanke, who was then the governor of the Federal Reserve, appeared on CBS' *60 Minutes* and explained how the agency \"rescued\" insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and other financial institutions from bankruptcy by lending money to them. Puzzled, the interviewer asked whether the Fed had manufactured billions of dollars. That wasn't quite the case.5\n\n\"So, to lend to a bank, we simply use the computer to mark up the size of the account that they have with the Fed,\" explained Bernanke. In other words, the Fed \"manufactured\" U.S. dollars through entries in its ledger.5 This ability to \"mark up\" an account exemplifies the nature of currencies in their digital form. It has implications for the velocity and use of currencies because it simplifies and streamlines transactions involving them.\n\n## Why Does Bitcoin Have Value?\n\nBitcoin does not have the backing of government authorities, nor does it have a system of intermediary banks to propagate its use. A decentralized network consisting of independent nodes is responsible for approving consensus-based transactions in the Bitcoin network. There is no fiat authority in the form of a government or other monetary authority to act as a counterparty to risk and make lenders whole, so to speak, if a transaction goes awry.\n\nThe cryptocurrency does display some attributes of a fiat currency system, however. It is scarce, and cannot be counterfeited. The only way that one would be able to create a counterfeit bitcoin would be by executing what is known as a [double-spend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublespending.asp). This refers to a situation in which a user \"spends\" or transfers the same bitcoin in two or more separate settings, effectively creating a duplicate record.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang Â© Investopedia 2020\n\n### Utility\n\nWhat makes double-spending unlikely, though, is the size of the Bitcoin network. A so-called [51% attack](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp), in which a group of miners theoretically control more than half of all network power, would be necessary. By controlling a majority of all network power, this group could dominate the remainder of the network to falsify records. However, such an attack on Bitcoin would require an overwhelming amount of effort, money, and computing power, thereby rendering the possibility extremely unlikely.\n\nBut Bitcoin often fails the utility test because people rarely use it for retail transactions. The main source of value for Bitcoin is its scarcity. The argument for Bitcoin's value is similar to that of gold—a commodity that shares characteristics with the cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency is limited to a quantity of 21 million.6\n\nBitcoin is much more divisible than fiat currencies. One bitcoin can be divided into up to eight decimal places, with constituent units called satoshis. Most fiat currencies can only be divided into two decimal places for everyday use.\n\nIf Bitcoin's price continues to rise over time, users with a tiny fraction of a bitcoin will still be able to make transactions with the cryptocurrency. The development of side channels, such as the Lightning Network, may further boost the value of Bitcoin's economy.\n\n### Scarcity\n\nBitcoin's value is a function of this scarcity. As the supply diminishes, demand for cryptocurrency has increased. Investors are clamoring for a slice of the ever-increasing profit pie that results from trading its limited supply.\n\nBitcoin also has limited utility like gold, the applications for which are mainly industrial. Bitcoin's underlying technology, called blockchain, is tested and used as a payment system. One of its most effective use cases is in [remittances](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/remittance.asp) across borders to bump up speed and drive down costs. Some countries, like El Salvador, are betting that Bitcoin's technology will evolve sufficiently to become a medium for daily transactions.7\n\n### Marginal Cost of Production\n\nAnother theory is that Bitcoin does have intrinsic value based on the [marginal cost of producing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalcostofproduction.asp) one bitcoin.8 Mining for bitcoins involves a great deal of electricity, and this imposes a real cost on miners. According to economic theory, in a competitive market among producers all making the same product, the selling price of that product will tend towards its marginal cost of production. Empirical evidence has shown that the price of a bitcoin tends to follow the [cost of production](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-determines-value-1-bitcoin/).9\n\n### Monetarist Theories\n\n[Monetarists](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarism.asp) try to value bitcoin as they would money, using the supply of money, its velocity, and the value of goods produced in an economy. The simplest way to this approach would be to look at the current worldwide value of all mediums of exchange and of all stores of value comparable to Bitcoin and then calculate the value of Bitcoin's projected percentage. The predominant medium of exchange is [government-backed money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp), and for our model, we will focus solely on that. Roughly speaking, the money supply ([M1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m1.asp)) in the U.S. was worth more than $20 trillion as of the end of 2021.10\n\nAssuming this total remains stable, if Bitcoin were to achieve 15% of this valuation, its [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) in today's money would be approximately $3 trillion. With all 21 million bitcoins in circulation, that would put the price of 1 bitcoin at roughly $143,000. \n \n\nEl Salvador became the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender on September 7, 2021.7 The cryptocurrency can be used for any transaction where the business can accept it. The U.S. dollar continues to be El Salvador’s primary currency.\n\n## The Challenges of Valuing Bitcoin\n\nOne of the biggest issues is Bitcoin's status as a store of value. Bitcoin's utility as a store of value depends on how well it works as a medium of exchange. If Bitcoin does not achieve success as a medium of exchange, it will not be useful as a store of value.\n\nThroughout much of its history, speculative interest has been the primary driver of Bitcoin's value. Bitcoin has exhibited the characteristics of a [bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp) with drastic price run-ups and a craze of media attention. This is likely to decline as Bitcoin continues to see greater mainstream adoption, but the future is uncertain.\n\nDifficulties surrounding cryptocurrency storage and exchange spaces also challenge Bitcoin's utility and transferability. In recent years, hacks, thefts, and fraud have plagued digital currency.11 \n \n\n## Why Do Some People Believe Bitcoins Are Worthless?\n\nLike any asset or thing of value, the price that people are willing to pay for Bitcoins is a socially-agreed upon level that is also based on supply and demand. Because Bitcoins are virtual, only existing within computer networks, some people have a hard time grasping that Bitcoins are scarce and that they have a cost of production. Because of this unwillingness to accept that digital traces can hold value in this way, they remain convinced that Bitcoins are worthless. Others who understand the Bitcoin system agree it is valuable.\n\n## Are Bitcoins Fairly Valued?\n\nThe market price of Bitcoin is highly volatile and subject to large price swings. As a result, the market price at any given time may vary wildly from its fair or intrinsic value. Still, over time, oversold markets tend to rebound and overbought markets cool off. Thus, it is impossible to say at any given moment whether Bitcoins are fairly valued without the benefit of hindsight.\n\n## Is Bitcoin Money?\n\nWhile Bitcoin has several money-like features, economists and regulators remain unconvinced that Bitcoin currently acts as money. This is because relatively few transactions are conducted in Bitcoins and very few things are denominated in Bitcoins. While people may trade Bitcoin in large volume and transfer value across the network, little commercial activity still takes place.\n\n## How Much Does it Cost to Produce 1 BTC?\n\nThe cost to produce one bitcoin depends on the cost of electricity, the mining difficulty, the block reward, and the energy efficiency of miners.8 With a block reward of 6.25 BTC, difficulty at 27.5 trillion, $0.15 per kWh, and energy efficiency of 45 joules per terahash, the cost to produce 1 BTC = $35,500.\n\n*Investing in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

In fact, An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. It is very worth our thinking. This fact is of great significance to me, and I believe it also has a certain significance to the world. In life, if An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. appears, we have to consider the fact that it appears. To be clear, An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. What kind of existence is it? An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. Why does it happen? Yuefu's \"Long Song Xing\" once said that if the young and strong do not work hard, the boss is sad. This seems very reasonable, right? We generally think that when we get to the crux of the problem, everything else will be solved. The meaning of An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. is actually hidden in our lives, and since this is the case, everyone has to face these issues. When faced with this kind of problem, then, Confucius said this inadvertently, the three armies can win the commander, but the individual cannot win the will. This seems very reasonable, right? An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. It is really worth exploring, Qu Yuan has a motto, the road is a long way to go, I will search up and down. This seems very reasonable, right? Heibel once said that life is school. There, it is better to say that a good teacher is a misfortune than a good teacher. I hope you can also appreciate this well. We have to face the very embarrassing fact that as for why think about An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. In fact, there is a deeper reason. The occurrence of An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. In the end, it needs to be done, and how will it happen if An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical. Napoleon Hill famously said, don't wait, the timing is never just right. This makes me think deeply. Einstein once said that only by devoting oneself to society can one find the meaning of that short and risky life. With this sentence, we have to look at this question more carefully: with these questions, let's take a look at An athlete has 24 hours to organise a musical.", "timestamp": 1654320389, "digest": "oUdnMzhvV9aWdYNFDlxy5_GupX6ar4vJh8YG01hgmL0", "contributor": "0x7b397dA5Bd525AAFC131107D47836304D65E446D"}

{"id": "2BEBIXNcxLiptK1mFa_UUENCpV11GqoljBmpLseo-bc", "title": "What Concerns to End Users have on Blockchain and Crypto", "body": "Why do users restrain from using blockchain? **Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubts.** \n\nInternet have scams and frauds, but still a lot of users use it, because it offers a far greater benefits than without it. It not only goes through a stage overcoming fear, uncertainties, and doubts, but also goes through a stage where, without it, people feel “they can’t live anymore.” Internet creates a dependency where its users depends on it. Its users are mostly addicted to it. We can see, with terms like “internet sabbaticals”, “restricting internet access time” coming up days to days. How does people restraint from using web3? \n\nFear, uncertainties, and doubts. While there exist internet banking today, various precautions and safety are in place that provides a safe haven for users to use. By safe haven, one don’t mean somewhere that’s absolutely safe. Password digest transferred through the internet isn’t absolutely safe, nor are password saved inside a database risk being hacked. A safe haven is somewhere where users find their community, where users can stop worrying about the various headaches of forgetting their passwords, of the security, etc. ***It’s something more emotional than logical***. \n\nConsidering blockchain. We assign the responsibility of each users to themselves, that they would keep their ledger safe, that they would keep their secure passphrase safe, that they won’t forget what their secure passphrase is. Not every users know how to put their password in Excel and encrypt their Excel file. Not every users have the thoughts of backing things up. And as a human, if we can stop worrying about something and assign that responsibility to somebody else, we tend to. ***We’re in favor of someone holding responsibility for us, so when things goes wrong, we can blame them than ourselves.*** It’s their fault, not ours, to lose our stuffs. We have something more important to care about, and we had already reassign these attention-demanding passwords and security to some experts and trustible entity to keep them for us. Blockchain tries to assign the responsibility back to the users that causes upheaval: a fear that they would lose their password and no one to back them up, no one there to help them, and they are in the water themselves, no one to save them. \n\nHuman lives as a team, a group, a collective beings. For most of us, we derive our security from external situations: either it be some materials, or another human being, usually someone close to us. It’s a miracle for us, deriving security from external circumstances, to take responsibility for ourselves, which derives internal security (or assigning security to our Gods), to keep something secure ourselves, without a “Forget your Password?” button to back things up. \n\nEnd users doubt the need of a blockchain. If things could be easily accessible in the familiar web2, why do we need web3 for? The design nowadays is replacing database (the backend) with smart contracts; and it has nothing to do with the frontend. What displays to users is similar to web2, except with extra buttons to click (signing transactions), extra time to wait (confirming transactions in slower-finality-chain like Ethereum). There are no large-enough benefits that people could see using a blockchain technology if they could achieve the same in current day technology. NFT offers a unique collectible when booking a hotel, booking a flight, etc, and collect after it’s used, to remember where you had been to and what happy moments you’ve had. For myself, one doesn’t feel so. \n\nAn NFT is a viewable entity. Perhaps additionally, it’s listenable entity. Visual and audio. As a kinesthetic learner myself, it triggers only if it could be touched. Holding a ticket to a zoo with a close friend of mine, one feels the emotional attachment via the ticket to one’s friend. Collecting a chocolate box gifted by ones’ friends, one could take out each unexpirable unthrown wrapper, after eating the expirable chocolate, just enjoying its touch. A hug with a close friends worth more than half an hour of deep conversations, video call. A physical book enhances my senses from feeling asleep, to focus on reading the book. ***Certainly, an NFT can replace a physical collectible if others aren’t kinesthetic; but a lacking in sense of touch reduces its emotional impact especially to kinesthetic learners.*** If an physical object that triggers a deeper emotion, offering its sense of sight, smell, taste, hear, and touch; what’s the point choosing one lying on the web with less surface area, offering only sense of sight and hear? \n\nBlockchain aims for **transparency and immutability** at the very least. For victims to gated-data and mutable-histories, it strengthen their believes, that blockchain is the way, to change what’s available today. For oneself, whom have difficulty and refuses to work more than 40 hours per week (I’m looking for work btw) **and** a difficulty to get paid via banks, remote works + cryptocurrency is the way to change. Not for others. \n\nFor most people, perhaps they may dream of what they want to become, but end up as a normal worker. A normal worker nowadays are quite “busy”, and they don’t have time to think about what they want to become, or even climbing up the ladder of success, if there is one that they can climb. Someone numb to work, that work is only for the money, that we wish for something else outside of work, that we work for others ***because we refuse to think of what work we can do ourselves***, because we want someone to keep us responsible. Startups are rare: it follows more workers joining a startup than there are co-founders and founders of a startup. It follows that failed startups may continue to not giving up, or they join as workers to successful startups. So, co-founders and founders are rare. \n\nBlockchain is mostly remote work. Yes, you can pay people via blockchain, just like paying people via banks, for physical work. But what for? Ignore the fact that most shop don’t accept cryptocurrencies yet; even if they do, fiat currency does fine today. Most people can settle for the average and use fiat. If there are no intense fluctuations in currency, **especially in their local currency and not USD which most crypto-stablecoin pins to**, plus a countrywide mass adoption, they could interchangeably use crypto or fiat, depending on what they have. ***If people can don’t think about a choice, people choose to not think about them, for they want to focus their attention on something else that worth their attention****.* \n\nA choice between crypto and fiat isn’t worth layman’s attention. If their boss pays them in mass-adopted crypto, they use crypto. If their boss pays them in fiat, they just use fiat. Who wants to swap their fiat, except for crypto enthusiasts and researching individuals whom can prove that crypto benefits more than fiat, ***if they need to pay for swap fee?*** They already earn quite little, for most people below the US average earnings, and exchanges from crypto to fiat eats more from their barely-enough income? Even saving the extra 0.1% can cause a difference in their life circumstances. \n\nPayment in cryptocurrency are indeed easier. You can pay and receive anywhere, without worrying whether PayPal restrict your country from receiving payments, or you aren’t living in the 200+ countries supported. All you need is internet access. Furthermore, inserting a card detail during online payment is not easier than creating a wallet and sign a transaction; indeed the former is more difficult while the latter is a one-off. It’s similar to one-off setup PayPal, except with more benefits. Not every site supports PayPal either, like not every site supports cryptocurrency payment. ***If only buying crypto with fiat is that easy***. \n\nNot every of us is gritty (you read Angela Duckworth’s “Grit” book?): for an obstacle that takes too much attention and effort we’re willing to exert and overcome, we shall back up and give up. That’s for the average human. If we could pay something easier with bank transfer or PayPal, already readily supported, what’s the point of first trying (with tremendous effort) porting our money to crypto and make the payment? Especially if your country doesn’t support crypto to fiat (and vice versa) exchanges: and if you gone through annoying processes that involve governments (so many forms and fields in a form to fill, be it related or unrelated, necessary or unnecessary; and even so, things doesn’t process sufficiently fast hence a long wait or a noreply for too long), fiat is a government-issued currency, so similar process you might go through even if your country supports crypto-fiat exchanges. \n\nRemember, blockchain tries to solve a different problem. It’s not clear that the problem it tries to solve: transparency and immutability, is applicable to all of us. Sure, we do want transparency of how Facebook and Google and Amazon and Microsoft uses our data: we want to know if they misuse our data. For most of us though, we prefer **signing up with half-true-half-fake information**, so even if they misuse these information, it isn’t fatal. For unless you need the annoying KYC that triggers a nerve in most people’s vein, just entering information, be it true or fake, doesn’t affect much. Facebook don’t really care if you enter a fake Birthday; they trust you to be truthful with the information you send; but if you cannot trust them, don’t use your real information! They trust you not to touch adult content if you haven’t reach legal age: which with parent’s supervision, it’s more than sufficient to turn on a “safe-search” equivalent for their children. Oh, they use your data to train a machine learning model? Go ahead and train man, we don’t care. \n\nSee, without a specific cause, most people don’t have the time and attention to care how their data is being used. We created blockchain to raise awareness for those whom don’t care, that if they noticed in news or somewhere, they could join in and fight for how their data is used. But when they aren’t aware, which most aren’t nowadays; they *doubt* whether there’s a need for blockchain. Those caring about transparency holds responsibility for the rest of us whom don’t care a s\\*\\*t of how it’s used. As long as a person don’t feel treated unfairly, usually its a *none-of-their-business*. There are far too many things to care about, most just choose to ignore small things that aren’t in their priority list. ***Unless we built a sufficiently easy-to-use platform with extra benefits that they can migrate to with ease, people tend to use whatever they can now***. \n\nFor one, fluctuations is not a priority. Maybe it is for some people, not me. And, given how much of us procrastinate… If one person could continue using Chrome without interventing their lives, they won’t migrate to Brave. Wow, it’s easy to migrate to Brave, just two clicks to migrate the saved cookies, plus logging in again on Brave to all that wasn’t log in? Well, if one continues to use Chrome, one don’t have to go through the hassle of trying to remember a password that either save somewhere or maybe already forgotten hence requires clicking “Reset your password” button migrating to Brave. If one is someone whom loves to procrastinate, one wouldn’t want to go through even clicking to download Brave browser. 30 seconds setup is a lot of time which one could lay down in bed for 30 more seconds. Something that’s done once, enough is enough. Migration to something else means doing the “one-off” stuff once again. \n\n> Btw, one is using Brave browser lol. \n\nNowadays, blockchain adopters are crypto investors, crypto lovers, blockchain enthusiast (from end-users to developers to other sectors). It’s known that most people still doesn’t put a feet in blockchain’s water, with their fear, uncertainties, and doubts of what benefits blockchain can bring, **and whether they even need the benefits or they could live without it**. One is new to Mirror; but have you read articles on read.cash or publish0x? They’re flooded with “Bitcoin”, “Crypto”, “some kinds of altcoins”, and anything that’s related to “Finance”: which are just boring articles. Where are the articles talking about nature? Where are those talking about some music? Where are those talking about self-improvements? ***These other sectors are what makes Medium strong; and you expect a normal user, whom want to search for a new recipe they can cook tonight, but not available on Web3 blogging pages, to use web3***? \n\nAnd **crypto terms!!!** What is FUD, what is HODL, what is staking, what is proof-of-work? End users don’t care a s\\*\\*t about these terms!!! An interface or an article that uses too much of these terms only attract those who can understand it, and shock those whom cannot. The latter, if you try to convince them again in the future, would have a bad first impression preventing them from re-adoption. The use of new blockchain terms integrated into the web2 interface is not fascinating. The aim is ***designing something that even someone whom don’t watch the news (like me) can onboard***. For example, one don’t even know what’s ledger, and one thought that web3 is a website with 3-D effects, when one first heard about it last December. Expect to design some wallet with words that everyone could understand. \n\nAnd staking? It’s like a saving for banks “locked saving accounts”. Well, flexible savings is the way to go; locked isn’t. And what’s this: \n\n![NEAR (Protocol) Wallet selecting Validator to Stake with](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fymKbxNRNaWhxjyYLSg4Y.png?height=913&width=821)\n\nThis requires user research on which one are trustworthy. And how does banks does it? Well, just transfer into a saving account and the bank will do the backend stuffs, either lending your money to whoever it is or lending your money to whoever it is. (ahem, deliberately repeated.) Users should not care about who to delegate to: as end-users love someone professional to take responsibility for them, to stake their tokens to someone trustworthy, and that their tokens won’t be “slashed” (lost). This is an example of giving end-users too much choice. With too much choice comes too difficult its usage. That’s why Ruby on Rails onboard more amateur programmers: they don’t have to worry about what name to give to a database, and many more default values/names that they don’t need to care about (especially for one whom have difficulty creating good, understandable names). \n\nFor if we want to onboard users to use Web3, we could. We have taken the smooth steps so, when they onboard a web3 website, they see things that are familiar (web2) frontend and not even notice they’re using web3 technologies. For end users whom want to onboard the blockchain, something that they could easily find and takes “zero effort” to onboard is the way. Not something that they need to search deep into Google page 87 before finding it; not something that they need to pay for storage cost initially (as a fan of NEAR Protocol, this “initial storage cost requirement” is what one would say, prevent people from onboarding blockchain, unless there’s a friend to send them some onboarding money, which they not necessary have the courage to request for especially for introverts or shy-er people). Blockchain are for the majority: not the minority crypto investors, ***and it’s time to think how we can design that***. \n\n(photos taken from pexels or unsplash)", "timestamp": 1654324352, "digest": "w8MStA6gTkA-o4fme-eaqlTYBTNnW51f1cQhfqCOiDc", "contributor": "0xa32e05D545FEc9cADb46BEB0839E3Ac0A9E39d9B"}

It not only goes through a stage overcoming fear, uncertainties, and doubts, but also goes through a stage where, without it, people feel “they can’t live anymore.” Internet creates a dependency where its users depends on it. Its users are mostly addicted to it. We can see, with terms like “internet sabbaticals”, “restricting internet access time” coming up days to days. How does people restraint from using web3? \n\nFear, uncertainties, and doubts. While there exist internet banking today, various precautions and safety are in place that provides a safe haven for users to use. By safe haven, one don’t mean somewhere that’s absolutely safe. Password digest transferred through the internet isn’t absolutely safe, nor are password saved inside a database risk being hacked. A safe haven is somewhere where users find their community, where users can stop worrying about the various headaches of forgetting their passwords, of the security, etc. ***It’s something more emotional than logical***. \n\nConsidering blockchain. We assign the responsibility of each users to themselves, that they would keep their ledger safe, that they would keep their secure passphrase safe, that they won’t forget what their secure passphrase is. Not every users know how to put their password in Excel and encrypt their Excel file. Not every users have the thoughts of backing things up. And as a human, if we can stop worrying about something and assign that responsibility to somebody else, we tend to. ***We’re in favor of someone holding responsibility for us, so when things goes wrong, we can blame them than ourselves.*** It’s their fault, not ours, to lose our stuffs. We have something more important to care about, and we had already reassign these attention-demanding passwords and security to some experts and trustible entity to keep them for us. Blockchain tries to assign the responsibility back to the users that causes upheaval: a fear that they would lose their password and no one to back them up, no one there to help them, and they are in the water themselves, no one to save them. \n\nHuman lives as a team, a group, a collective beings. For most of us, we derive our security from external situations: either it be some materials, or another human being, usually someone close to us. It’s a miracle for us, deriving security from external circumstances, to take responsibility for ourselves, which derives internal security (or assigning security to our Gods), to keep something secure ourselves, without a “Forget your Password?” button to back things up. \n\nEnd users doubt the need of a blockchain. If things could be easily accessible in the familiar web2, why do we need web3 for? The design nowadays is replacing database (the backend) with smart contracts; and it has nothing to do with the frontend. What displays to users is similar to web2, except with extra buttons to click (signing transactions), extra time to wait (confirming transactions in slower-finality-chain like Ethereum). There are no large-enough benefits that people could see using a blockchain technology if they could achieve the same in current day technology. NFT offers a unique collectible when booking a hotel, booking a flight, etc, and collect after it’s used, to remember where you had been to and what happy moments you’ve had. For myself, one doesn’t feel so. \n\nAn NFT is a viewable entity. Perhaps additionally, it’s listenable entity. Visual and audio. As a kinesthetic learner myself, it triggers only if it could be touched. Holding a ticket to a zoo with a close friend of mine, one feels the emotional attachment via the ticket to one’s friend. Collecting a chocolate box gifted by ones’ friends, one could take out each unexpirable unthrown wrapper, after eating the expirable chocolate, just enjoying its touch. A hug with a close friends worth more than half an hour of deep conversations, video call. A physical book enhances my senses from feeling asleep, to focus on reading the book. ***Certainly, an NFT can replace a physical collectible if others aren’t kinesthetic; but a lacking in sense of touch reduces its emotional impact especially to kinesthetic learners.*** If an physical object that triggers a deeper emotion, offering its sense of sight, smell, taste, hear, and touch; what’s the point choosing one lying on the web with less surface area, offering only sense of sight and hear? \n\nBlockchain aims for **transparency and immutability** at the very least. For victims to gated-data and mutable-histories, it strengthen their believes, that blockchain is the way, to change what’s available today. For oneself, whom have difficulty and refuses to work more than 40 hours per week (I’m looking for work btw) **and** a difficulty to get paid via banks, remote works + cryptocurrency is the way to change. Not for others. \n\nFor most people, perhaps they may dream of what they want to become, but end up as a normal worker. A normal worker nowadays are quite “busy”, and they don’t have time to think about what they want to become, or even climbing up the ladder of success, if there is one that they can climb. Someone numb to work, that work is only for the money, that we wish for something else outside of work, that we work for others ***because we refuse to think of what work we can do ourselves***, because we want someone to keep us responsible. Startups are rare: it follows more workers joining a startup than there are co-founders and founders of a startup. It follows that failed startups may continue to not giving up, or they join as workers to successful startups. So, co-founders and founders are rare. \n\nBlockchain is mostly remote work. Yes, you can pay people via blockchain, just like paying people via banks, for physical work. But what for? Ignore the fact that most shop don’t accept cryptocurrencies yet; even if they do, fiat currency does fine today. Most people can settle for the average and use fiat. If there are no intense fluctuations in currency, **especially in their local currency and not USD which most crypto-stablecoin pins to**, plus a countrywide mass adoption, they could interchangeably use crypto or fiat, depending on what they have. ***If people can don’t think about a choice, people choose to not think about them, for they want to focus their attention on something else that worth their attention****.* \n\nA choice between crypto and fiat isn’t worth layman’s attention. If their boss pays them in mass-adopted crypto, they use crypto. If their boss pays them in fiat, they just use fiat. Who wants to swap their fiat, except for crypto enthusiasts and researching individuals whom can prove that crypto benefits more than fiat, ***if they need to pay for swap fee?*** They already earn quite little, for most people below the US average earnings, and exchanges from crypto to fiat eats more from their barely-enough income? Even saving the extra 0.1% can cause a difference in their life circumstances. \n\nPayment in cryptocurrency are indeed easier. You can pay and receive anywhere, without worrying whether PayPal restrict your country from receiving payments, or you aren’t living in the 200+ countries supported. All you need is internet access. Furthermore, inserting a card detail during online payment is not easier than creating a wallet and sign a transaction; indeed the former is more difficult while the latter is a one-off. It’s similar to one-off setup PayPal, except with more benefits. Not every site supports PayPal either, like not every site supports cryptocurrency payment. ***If only buying crypto with fiat is that easy***. \n\nNot every of us is gritty (you read Angela Duckworth’s “Grit” book?): for an obstacle that takes too much attention and effort we’re willing to exert and overcome, we shall back up and give up. That’s for the average human. If we could pay something easier with bank transfer or PayPal, already readily supported, what’s the point of first trying (with tremendous effort) porting our money to crypto and make the payment? Especially if your country doesn’t support crypto to fiat (and vice versa) exchanges: and if you gone through annoying processes that involve governments (so many forms and fields in a form to fill, be it related or unrelated, necessary or unnecessary; and even so, things doesn’t process sufficiently fast hence a long wait or a noreply for too long), fiat is a government-issued currency, so similar process you might go through even if your country supports crypto-fiat exchanges. \n\nRemember, blockchain tries to solve a different problem. It’s not clear that the problem it tries to solve: transparency and immutability, is applicable to all of us. Sure, we do want transparency of how Facebook and Google and Amazon and Microsoft uses our data: we want to know if they misuse our data. For most of us though, we prefer **signing up with half-true-half-fake information**, so even if they misuse these information, it isn’t fatal. For unless you need the annoying KYC that triggers a nerve in most people’s vein, just entering information, be it true or fake, doesn’t affect much. Facebook don’t really care if you enter a fake Birthday; they trust you to be truthful with the information you send; but if you cannot trust them, don’t use your real information! They trust you not to touch adult content if you haven’t reach legal age: which with parent’s supervision, it’s more than sufficient to turn on a “safe-search” equivalent for their children. Oh, they use your data to train a machine learning model? Go ahead and train man, we don’t care. \n\nSee, without a specific cause, most people don’t have the time and attention to care how their data is being used. We created blockchain to raise awareness for those whom don’t care, that if they noticed in news or somewhere, they could join in and fight for how their data is used. But when they aren’t aware, which most aren’t nowadays; they *doubt* whether there’s a need for blockchain. Those caring about transparency holds responsibility for the rest of us whom don’t care a s\\*\\*t of how it’s used. As long as a person don’t feel treated unfairly, usually its a *none-of-their-business*. There are far too many things to care about, most just choose to ignore small things that aren’t in their priority list. ***Unless we built a sufficiently easy-to-use platform with extra benefits that they can migrate to with ease, people tend to use whatever they can now***. \n\nFor one, fluctuations is not a priority. Maybe it is for some people, not me. And, given how much of us procrastinate… If one person could continue using Chrome without interventing their lives, they won’t migrate to Brave. Wow, it’s easy to migrate to Brave, just two clicks to migrate the saved cookies, plus logging in again on Brave to all that wasn’t log in? Well, if one continues to use Chrome, one don’t have to go through the hassle of trying to remember a password that either save somewhere or maybe already forgotten hence requires clicking “Reset your password” button migrating to Brave. If one is someone whom loves to procrastinate, one wouldn’t want to go through even clicking to download Brave browser. 30 seconds setup is a lot of time which one could lay down in bed for 30 more seconds. Something that’s done once, enough is enough. Migration to something else means doing the “one-off” stuff once again. \n\n> Btw, one is using Brave browser lol. \n\nNowadays, blockchain adopters are crypto investors, crypto lovers, blockchain enthusiast (from end-users to developers to other sectors). It’s known that most people still doesn’t put a feet in blockchain’s water, with their fear, uncertainties, and doubts of what benefits blockchain can bring, **and whether they even need the benefits or they could live without it**. One is new to Mirror; but have you read articles on read.cash or publish0x? They’re flooded with “Bitcoin”, “Crypto”, “some kinds of altcoins”, and anything that’s related to “Finance”: which are just boring articles. Where are the articles talking about nature? Where are those talking about some music? Where are those talking about self-improvements? ***These other sectors are what makes Medium strong; and you expect a normal user, whom want to search for a new recipe they can cook tonight, but not available on Web3 blogging pages, to use web3***? \n\nAnd **crypto terms!!!** What is FUD, what is HODL, what is staking, what is proof-of-work? End users don’t care a s\\*\\*t about these terms!!! An interface or an article that uses too much of these terms only attract those who can understand it, and shock those whom cannot. The latter, if you try to convince them again in the future, would have a bad first impression preventing them from re-adoption. The use of new blockchain terms integrated into the web2 interface is not fascinating. The aim is ***designing something that even someone whom don’t watch the news (like me) can onboard***. For example, one don’t even know what’s ledger, and one thought that web3 is a website with 3-D effects, when one first heard about it last December. Expect to design some wallet with words that everyone could understand. \n\nAnd staking? It’s like a saving for banks “locked saving accounts”. Well, flexible savings is the way to go; locked isn’t.

We have taken the smooth steps so, when they onboard a web3 website, they see things that are familiar (web2) frontend and not even notice they’re using web3 technologies. For end users whom want to onboard the blockchain, something that they could easily find and takes “zero effort” to onboard is the way. Not something that they need to search deep into Google page 87 before finding it; not something that they need to pay for storage cost initially (as a fan of NEAR Protocol, this “initial storage cost requirement” is what one would say, prevent people from onboarding blockchain, unless there’s a friend to send them some onboarding money, which they not necessary have the courage to request for especially for introverts or shy-er people). Blockchain are for the majority: not the minority crypto investors, ***and it’s time to think how we can design that***. \n\n(photos taken from pexels or unsplash)", "timestamp": 1654324583, "digest": "w8MStA6gTkA-o4fme-eaqlTYBTNnW51f1cQhfqCOiDc", "contributor": "0xa32e05D545FEc9cADb46BEB0839E3Ac0A9E39d9B"}

{"id": "G6K5efQTUGEKtBAxaOrY3lsCsAObO4DQozKdppltnOo", "title": "NFT入门小册子", "body": "本文是对我这个月来观察NFT生态的反思总结，适合新晋研究者阅读以快速熟悉行业框架并构建自己的知识体系。文中的NFT主要指代PFP性质或其它拥有类似发行方式的主流消费品性质NFT，不适用于艺术类或游戏效用类等NFT项目。所提及的项目仅为举例，不构成投资建议。\n\n## 公链\n\n* NFT数据存在于链上，不同的链有不同的NFT生态。\n  * 以太坊是目前接受度最广、NFT升值潜力最大的链，许多艺术品和权益性资产会发布在这里。\n  * Polygon作为以太坊的二层扩容方案更多被用于发行实用资产，如纪念品性质的poap或一些可以牺牲升值空间的身份证明等。日本艺术家更加喜欢使用Polygon来发布自己的艺术品并以其上的ETH结算。\n  * 另外有Flow等适合大规模商业部署的公链或Tezos等具有地域特征的艺术链，它们都拥有完全不同于以太坊的NFT（创作者、平台、分发模式等）生态。\n\n## 合约开发\n\n* 铸造NFT所需的智能合约。一个合格的智能合约应该能保证NFT发行前后链上操作的安全性和稳定性；而一个优秀的智能合约应该在满足上述条件的情况下尽可能地优化用户的交互体验（如AZUKI的ERC721A可以帮用户节约铸造gas费）。\n* 如果一个crypto项目连合约都做不好，用户又有什么理由去信任它呢？\n\n## 项目组\n\n* 包含策划、运营、市场等职能部门。一些项目组选择匿名，这并不是一个减分项，需要结合具体情况进行分析，但实名的项目更容易取得用户的信任。**实名不是单纯地使用“真实姓名”，还需要能够确实地对应到现实世界中的个人**。\n* **策划**需要确立整个项目的目标、调性和发行策略（包含总量、白名单的分发策略、销售模式等）。\n  * 一个可靠的项目应该有**鲜明的调性**，如BAYC是一群有钱而无聊的人，AZUKI是亚文化社群，小幽灵是国产的Crypto Native艺术，LAG是日本加密二次元画师的粉丝团等。仿盘在牛市可能拥有价格潜力，但私心只希望支持真正的探索者而非模仿者。\n  * **路线图应清晰且可行**。策划需要对项目有较为长远的计划，并能保证执行它们。许多土狗项目喜欢在路线图上吹得天花乱坠，但是它们表现出的实力和匿名的身份并不能让人信服这些大饼能够被做出来。\n  * 白名单分配一般包含团队预留、官方抽奖、联动抽奖、KOL抽奖、运营活动、活动预留等部分。合理的白名单分配应该在尽量满足真实用户需求的情况下为未来运营留出空间。\n  * Mint价格应该在合理范围内（一般是0.03\\~0.08ETH），更高的价格需要项目在同类产品中的显着优势来支持。一般情况下白名单Mint的数量也应在合理范围内（1\\~2个，最多3个）。\n  * 最早的销售模式是仅公售；随着流量涌入，项目方引入了白名单预售+公售的常用模式；一些强运营的项目会选择全部白名单且不存在公售；亦有以荷兰拍起步，接以带折扣的白名单预售（如AZUKI、TSUBASA），最后进入公售的模式。另外有Stealth Mint这种突击mint的形式（如BrokenSea），官方随机公布mint时间并由用户自行参与。\n* **运营**需要持续管理推特账户和Discord服务器并维持它们的活跃度（存量运营），并制定运营计划和举办活动来加强和维系用户“共识”。包括前期运营、中期运营和后期运营。\n  * 推特是窗口，Discord是大本营。**如果一个项目的Discord人数大于推特关注数三倍及以上，那么这个项目大概率挤满了工作室和机器人**，因为工作室只需要关注“肝白”的过程而不需要每个人都关注项目动态。工作室会冲一些它们能够批量获取白名单的项目，而优质的项目会反向筛选以增加真实用户的中标率。\n    * ~~工作室三连：这是什么项目？怎么白？是国人项目吗？~~\n  * 前期运营主要涵盖推特和Discord起量的过程，为项目积累种子用户。最基础的方式是同步开放推特和Discord，并同步更新项目信息。一些强运营的项目会对Discord服务器进行“计生”，定期或不定期在推特发布邀请链接并引入新成员，以此达到饥饿营销的效果。如果项目贸然采用这种方式而不具有对应的实力就会被认定为耍猴。\n  * 中期运营是最主要的环节，在这个阶段项目开始分发白名单并积累活跃用户。主要方式包括各种抽奖和各显神通的Discord活动。\n    * 抽奖包括项目内部、外部collab联动（包含一般NFT和Alpha社群）、KOL等形式。\n    * 在我的认知里Angel Metaverse最早开始引入社群内部的小团体活动（军团竞赛）以激发社群良性竞争，鼓励优质的活跃以形成正循环。Lil Blob也采用了类似的分班竞争模式。\n    * Cupcats通过频道内猜隐去的NFT特征等活动，让真正关注项目的人更有机会获得白名单。\n    * 小幽灵的秘密行动打破了虚拟与现实间的墙，非常具有meta意味，虽然难度很高。\n    * CA22的成就和小幽灵的集五鬼都可看作碎片化的白名单，让用户的每一步都有“记录”，进而激发社群活力。\n  * 后期运营同样不容忽视，除非项目方想捞一笔就跑。发行完成后的持续运营会对价格产生稳定有力的托底。\n    * 发行后的首要任务是确保路线图的执行。BrokenSea开局破发，但地板价丝毫不影响团队严格执行路线图目标。目前已顺利达成代币空投和实体服装兑换等关键节点，并成功举办多次发行后运营活动并送出奖励。\n    * 发行后依然可以进行AMA等形式的collab联动，必要时可用团队库存NFT作为奖品。河里人Rivermen起步未占到天时地利，但目前为止仍保持着稳定的AMA频率和质量，为关注者持续更新项目信息和带来新的机会。\n    * 一个合格的项目方推出第二系列的NFT、并为其前一系列持有人提供白名单权益时，将会较大地提振其前一个系列的二级市场信心（共识）。这包括变异药水（如BAYC）和全新系列（如Cupcats）等。\n  * 活跃且高质量的社群是NFT的核心，而要达成这一点99%的情况下是需要**中心化运营**的。如果一个社群框架都没搭好就要开始DAO并且来者不拒，你就已经可以收拾包裹准备跑路了。\n* **市场**主要负责获取增量流量和为项目争取资源，在项目前中期具有十分重要的任务。\n  * collab联动虽然是运营行为，但寻找collab目标并敲定合作是市场部门的职能。寻找和筛选合适的联动目标并与之沟通确定合作细节需要专人负责。\n    * 正常的联动是资源互换的过程，实力相仿的项目一般会互换白名单名额等资源来交换流量和扩展社群。通过一个项目能够争取到的联动资源，我们也可以从侧面看出项目的实力。\n    * 和研究型组织（如猫岛）、Alpha社群联动进行AMA也是不错的选择。\n    * 需要注意的是，一些项目会单方面宣布“联动”，允许一些蓝筹NFT持有者直接获得自己的白名单，这并不能算作有效的联动。\n  * KOL是另一个重要的方向。通过给不同KOL发放名额并举办转发抽奖活动提升自己的影响力也是非常常用的营销手段。\n    * 一些海外KOL会定期发起“预算”由粉丝推荐购买项目，这时需要运营部门配合进行“twitter raid”让用户去下面留言推荐自己的项目。被选中的项目会在短期内获得该KOL粉丝的极大关注。\n    * 通过合作KOL的类型和质量也可以看出项目的实力和格局。目前已经有黑灰产KOL存在，他们通过买粉买量伪装身份骗取白名单资格。项目方和用户都需要擦亮双眼。\n\n## 第三方项目组成员\n\n* 受成本、人脉等各种因素限制，许多NFT项目组仅仅包含了核心的策划职能，因而诞生了一些专门接取“外包”运营和市场功能的个人或团体来辅助项目方。但是这个行业目前还非常早期，存在着许多不规范的现象，甚至诞生了黑灰产。\n  * “职业MOD”一般以个人居多。他们往往喜欢“广撒网多捞鱼”，用一套固定的话术进入各个NFT社群并申请MOD，通过付出劳动换取项目方赠与的白名单资格。他们可能拥有一定的社群管理经验，但大多仅限于维护聊天秩序、格式化地引导新人等基础能力，极少有人能够真正把握到每个项目真正的核心竞争力并将其代入到运营中，为社群带来真正的价值。**个人认为，项目方应该拥有自己的社群管理部门；从用户中选拔的MOD应严格遵循一些原则，宁缺毋滥**。\n  * 部分专门进行市场行为的独立个人或组织会以顾问等形式参与到项目方的营销活动中。他们往往拥有较多的社群资源，能够快速帮项目对接和敲定联动，建立起流量优势，并从项目方取得白名单等资源作为报酬。规范化的市场小组可能在短期内有一定的发展空间。与伪造KOL类似，也有一些个人或组织伪造市场小组来骗取白名单。\n\n# 场外白名单交易\n\n* 由市场过热催生出的商业模式，主要参与者为白名单工作室和担保人等。\n* 白名单工作室，顾名思义是通过劳动密集型劳作批量获取白名单的组织。\n  * 以线下或线上的形式安排廉价劳动力（一般是大学生，更高级的还有小语种本地人以避开对中文区更强的规制）高强度参与NFT社群活跃（俗称肝白），并以此获得白名单名额并在场外出售获利，价格一般从100U到1ETH不等。真·网络兼职日入上百，但随着泡沫消退和韭菜受教育程度提高，场外白名单交易的收益显着下降。\n    * 场外白名单流动性极差，价格滑点大，定价完全受供需影响，相对项目真实价值往往具有较大偏差。较为合理的白名单定价会吃走项目真实的Alpha作为mint价的浮盈存在。\n  * 随着白名单规则的更新，诞生了一批以“卖艺”维生的工作室。形式包括但不限于板绘、手绘、沙画、3D建模、编曲、弹唱、堆雪人等，通常在闲鱼或微信接单。通过收取约100\\~300元不等的价格产出符合要求的fanart或其它作品，由单主自行投递。\n* 亦有为肝白者提供服务的组织。\n  * 皇帝肝是一个较为典型的肝白互助组织，通过集结个人肝白者统一行动获得较大的声量和话语权，并为组织产生一些额外收益。\n  * JuanDAO等作为第三方平台为个人白名单场外交易者提供辅助，承担信息聚合、买卖撮合和交易担保等功能。\n  * 职业担保人为白名单交易提供信用保障。一般流程为卖家填写买家地址或直接出售Discord账号，买家打钱给担保人，待确认交易结束后担保人将钱款打给卖家。其间产生的服务费由买卖双方商议并按约定比例支付给担保人作为报酬。\n    * 个人不推荐进行场外交易，但如果一定要交易请**务必选择可靠的担保人**，任何一个仅由对方推荐的担保人都可能是骗局。**如果对方只认某个特定担保人，除非自己确认担保人为真，否则直接当诈骗处置**。\n\n# 发行 · 交易平台\n\n* 不同的项目方会有不同的运营风格，从而选择不同的发行方式。此处仅讨论消费品和部分偏消费品的NFT（比如日本二次元加密艺术家画的二次元小画片），主要涉及三种发行方式。\n  * PFP类项目都是项目组自己开发合约，一级发行时由用户通过合约mint，并在OpenSea等二级市场交易流通。\n  * 一些艺术家会选择使用OpenSea的一键上链功能铸造自己的NFT，然后通过OpenSea的拍卖或bid功能进行一级发售。许多加密艺术家喜欢使用这种方式。\n  * 另一些艺术家会选择在Foundation等NFT艺术品平台通过拍卖等方式一级发售自己的作品，这些作品也可以进入OpenSea等二级市场流通。与上面一点不同的是，这类NFT往往发行价格更高且受众更窄，一般是具有一定实力的艺术家才会采用这种方式。\n\n# NFT工具\n\n* 为NFT用户提供支持的辅助工具，用数据支持逻辑，辅助投资或投机行为。\n  * Nansen等数据平台一般为订阅制，为付费用户提供NFT二级交易数据追踪服务。它们一般除了拥有基础的交易数据以外还有更多包含潜在分析价值的仪表盘，以及巨鲸行为追踪等附加功能。总的来说可以为投资者提供更多的信息以做出更及时更科学的决策。\n  * Gem等NFT聚合平台可以为用户聚合主流NFT二级市场的挂单信息，减少信息差并为用户提供更优的价格选择。另外Gem还为用户提供打包购买功能和扫地板等功能，以帮助用户节省gas费用和提供更加便捷的交易方式。\n  * Trait Sniper等稀有度工具可以通过浏览器插件或网页的形式帮用户快速查看NFT在同collection中的稀有度排名，进而帮助用户快速进行价值/价格判断和定位贱卖的高罕NFT。\n\n# 用户组织\n\n* NFT玩家或用户组成的各类分享资源和信息的组织。\n  * Alpha社群一般具有规模小、人员重合度高、身份标识NFT价格贵等特征，一般要求用户持有自己的NFT才能进入核心社群交流，门槛较高。社群中一般会提供各类一手信息、巨鲸追踪、市场异动报警等服务。Alpha社群经常能从新的优质项目中拿到大量白名单资源。\n  * 投研社群如321等，以研究驱动，对资金门槛没有要求。社群成员之间相互分享优质项目和逻辑并交流讨论，以期达到更好的投资成果。\n  * 肝白互助组织如皇帝肝，上文提过此处不再赘述。\n  * 另有一些类似KOL粉丝社群的组织，一般会为其粉丝提供更直接的交流机会和其对接到的资源的优先获取权等。\n\n# 创作者组织\n\n* 为志同道合的NFT创作者提供交流和互助平台的组织，一般由较有影响力的艺术家发起。\n  * 偏内向型的创作者团体如WeirDAO是国内加密艺术家团体，内部艺术家互动频繁，曾发布过合作作品。近期很火的小幽灵便是其中一名艺术家Sleepy的作品，该系列中有大量1/1作品出自WeirDAO其它艺术家之手。\n  * 偏外向型的创作者团体如Soudan NFT · Love Addicted Girls是日本二次元加密艺术家团体发行的、pfp形式的粉丝pass。该团体包含诸位日本二次元艺术家，其中不乏作品卖出过高价的著名画师，也有刚刚起步但潜力十足的创作者。持有NFT可以享受组织内画师作品的优先购买权和潜在的空投权等。", "timestamp": 1654320807, "digest": "pHydf041osKZg3Ooq9VeJ7usq6_kbJzaiPWsLAV6lcI",

"*注：本文纯个人观点。*\n\n![少打了几个字！](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U_LsUccKl-Us4QMFyJYjO.png?height=186&width=366)\n\n## 什么是tokenomics？\n\n提起tokenomics，很多人可能觉得就是项目方发个币，让大家去买，买完之后就完全是二级市场的事情；而一提及tokenomics设计，可能会有人说那有什么好设计的？一个普遍的认知在于，token可以用来奖励用户，用来社区治理，用来模拟股票对项目估值，而水面之下的一个很核心的问题没能被很好地重视——**token的价格靠什么支撑？**\n\n我们买股票，除去二级市场博弈外，更多地在于看好公司未来的发展，股票持有者的好处无外乎分红与治理；我们买一件商品，则看重其实际的使用效用。同样地，token购买者的目的无非这几点：二级博弈、分红（项目发展红利）、治理、实际效用。基于这几点如何去设计token机制呢？卖个关子。\n\n先为tokenomics下一个定义。\n\n首先，从这个词本身出发，tokenomics=token+economics，即通证与经济学的结合体。\n\n**通证**。为什么不说代币？因为代币本身被赋予了一部分货币的意思，从实际情况来看，大部分token本身并不具有货币的属性；而大家经常使用代币代指“fungible token”，导致同为代币的“non-fungible token”直接作为NFT成为与代币并列的一端，甚至现在完全成了小图片的代指。所以咱们不如条理清晰些：token（通证）包括代币与NFT。也就是说，token机制设计是包含NFT的。\n\n**经济学**。经济学的研究起点于微观经济学，而微观经济学的核心是研究个体的行为。无论是供需分析、成本收益分析，还是契约理论、博弈论，其出发点均是对个体行为倾向的假设（理性人假设）。契约理论、博弈论等又被应用到制度经济学、组织设计等领域中，也就是我们口中常说的“激励制度”设计。也就是说，**token设计要以用户行为为起点**。\n\n那么tokenomics设计能带来什么变化呢？\n\ntokenomics将“激励制度”设计应用到产品层面，即在前期市场调研后确定用户画像与需求评估，进而模拟用户行为路径，设计产品功能。这其中，token发挥的作用就是对用户行为的引导。\n\n由此，tokenomics实际上是通过与产品功能的结合（甚至包括运营、营销的结合），去设计这样一个激励机制的系统，去完成用户行为的引导，以实现产品的愿景。\n\n这又涉及到一个问题，**用户行为到底该不该被引导？**\n\n对于web2来说，用户使用一款产品通常是零门槛的，这意味着如果产品无法满足用户需求，用户就会用脚投票到更适合他自己的产品。所以，连脚跟都没有站稳的产品是无法对用户做出行为引导的，反而需要持续去满足用户的需求；只有足够优秀的产品，才有引导用户的实力与可能性，例如微信所推出的公众号服务。\n\n那么web3呢？一个典型的特征是**用户行为被金融化**，用户从自己的行为数据中有利可图了。这意味着用户对于web3产品具有一个天然的价值流出的倾向。以空投举例，这一行为本身是对项目建设有贡献的用户进行物质激励，逐渐衍变成空投猎人的欢乐场，大部分空投实际并没有发到产品的真实用户手中（当然，项目方也需要这些数据讲故事）。**token激励异化了用户行为，用户用一个产品不一定是因为“喜欢”“有需求”，也有可能是因为“有钱赚”**。\n\n这正常吗？这不正常。\n\n产品是为用户服务的，如果不是为了满足用户的需求，这类产品的开发就是在浪费资源、制造泡沫。不过既然逐利而来的用户不可避免，何不将计就计呢？为token激励而来，我就以token为饵，把你吊到产品里面去，你真心使用产品，获得激励加成的双倍快乐；你是专门来赚钱的，我要确保你至少对项目发展做出了贡献。刷几次交易获得token然后让你砸盘跑路？这是图省事的项目方为了博得去中心化的美名才会使用的方法，你让项目方别融资自己掏钱，他就不会轻易给你空投了……\n\n综上，我的观点是，一定需要引导，否则token设计形同虚设；做web2产品来提供web3服务同样可以活得很好，为什么非要来趟这浑水呢？\n\n举例来说，最近有一款做得非常棒的NFT数据服务产品NFTrack，完全没有必要发行token，同样是在提供web3服务；如果它决定发行token，就必须考虑到token如何被奖励、奖励方式是否公平、抛压如何解决等问题，假使它不做引导，用户就会涌向最赚钱的使用方式，然后把流动池砸穿。如果加上一个分红预期的引导，市场就会对产品有一个预期估值，从而让部分用户转为持有；如果奖励不基于产品使用，而纯粹来源于利润分配与建设贡献，那么真实用户占比则会更高。\n\n*再插一句题外话，之前的观点里我一直觉得stepn对运动行为的激励进行了重构，最近看到有朋友说告别stepn第一天感觉到轻松，不禁开始反思：token对行为的引导一定是正面的吗？会不会从一个极端（根本不去”做“）去往了另一个极端（”做“成为了负担）？anyway，用户相对来说获得了选择的权利，如果采用token激励的dapp让其感到压力，那就退出，这么一想，便觉得宽慰了。*\n\n## 为什么要重视tokenomics？\n\n**token的出现，直接把产品带进了市场，产品的每一步都会在市场中得到检验**。对比web2产品，融资完不停积累用户，好不容易盈利了想办法上市，上市后部分早期投资者退出，等到接盘流动性稳定后，才能达到和web3产品差不多的状态。但实际上，web2产品用户的99%都并非股票购买者……\n\n产品的运行情况时刻反映在token市场中。举几个典型例子：\n\nAxie infinity。Axie在玩家加速涌入后，没有及时处理繁殖速度与玩家增长速度的平衡关系，导致$SLP产出远大于消耗，抛压无法承接，价格暴跌，恶性循环。\n\nCurve war。将治理功能给予结合了锁仓时间价值的ve token，用户可以利用治理权驱使流动性到指定池子，这极大提升了$CRV锁仓的需求，$CRV在很长一段时间保持坚挺。\n\nOlympus。通过机制设计协调了用户与协议的激励，极大地避免了传统AMM矿币抛售的问题，维持了一段时间的火爆（当然，Olympus也存在一些问题，详见我之前的文章）。\n\nLuna。极其简洁的左右脚设计，以luna生态应用为支撑，$UST已然成长为算稳王者，之后几乎是瞬间陨落……\n\n如我前文所言，提供web3服务完全可以不发行token，一旦选择发行，与其让鸡肋token不停价值流出带崩项目本身，不如好好去思索代币机制的设计。**优秀的代币设计是具有内在的稳定机理的，在大多数情况下，它们能够维持在一个动态的平衡**。大多数人提及axie必然要嘲讽其token设计的庞氏，又有多少人愿意去翻看$SLP的铸造与烧毁数据，去研究其经济模型运转是哪里出了问题，如果存在问题是否会有更好的处理方式呢？web3仍在发展之中，如果碰到个事情就用旧逻辑代入，一遍一遍去自己说服自己沉醉于某些自洽的观点，这个领域还能够进步吗？\n\n嘲讽与经验主义不会对事物发展有任何帮助，反思与改进才是我们应该做的。\n\n在luna-ust崩溃后，价格跌到$3时我曾提示，在倍数膨胀的luna供应面前，千万不要有人去抄底，无论价格多低。\n\n[https://twitter.com/jokenomicser/status/1524329965407584256?s=20&t=7qI7xygSX-65fvQUsro14Q](https://twitter.com/jokenomicser/status/1524329965407584256?s=20&t=7qI7xygSX-65fvQUsro14Q)\n\n有多少人去抄了底呢？又有多少人在luna停止铸造后买入暴富的呢？抄底的原因是什么？不是骂代币设计是庞氏吗？此外，想抄底为什么不在luna停止铸造后抄，非得人家咔咔咔放水的时候抄？说到底，大概没有多少人细看过别人的代币模型，但凡不符合旧认知的就是垃圾，但凡赚到钱了就又巩固了一遍旧认知？\n\n项目方不懂tokenomics依然有可能获得成功，凭借他们强大的产品或者营销能力；散户不懂tokenomics，也……确实没有影响……只是或许某一天因为这个亏大钱了，才会稍微有那么一点点遗憾吧。**Tokenomics的意义在于，可以没有，可以平平无奇，但绝不能在存在明显缺陷时还不知内情，且无应对之法。**\n\n## 什么是庞氏？\n\n无论是axie、luna还是stepn，大多数项目似乎难逃庞氏的诟病。我认为这其实还是来源于大多数人对庞氏的理解，是与“骗局”一词相联系的，但事实上，生活无处不庞氏，如果你把它看作是一类事物运作逻辑的话。\n\n先看下庞氏的定义。**庞氏本是指一类骗局，指利用新投资人的钱来向老投资者支付利息和短期回报，以制造赚钱的假象，进而骗取更多的投资**。这个词起源于一个叫做查尔斯庞兹的投机商人。他策划了一个虚假的投资项目，许诺投资者将于三个月内得到40%回报，由于把新投资者的钱用于支付最初投资的人，骗局成功进行下去并吸引了更多投资者。直到一年之后，人们才清醒过来……\n\n现在，让我们换一个故事。一个商人，策划了一个投资项目，许诺投资者将于三年后得到400%回报（也可以说投资者自己yy三年后高回报），三年后，由于项目发展，新的投资者大批涌入，涌入的资金用于支付最初投资的人，项目成功进行下去……发现了吗？这其实是一个创业者与风投机构浪漫牵手的故事，三年后IPO，二级市场上看好企业的投资者“接盘”了早期投资者。\n\n看出庞氏骗局与投资的区别了吗？庞氏骗局并没有用钱去生产（圈里大家常说的，项目方在做事），**因为它一开始就是一个骗局，而非它用新投资者的钱支付早期投资者收益的“庞氏”逻辑**。后者大家一般都认可这叫做投资，那怎么换了个说法你的认知就变了呢？\n\n**严格来说，庞氏并不是一个贬义词，骗局才是**。 （有点咬文嚼字了，意思大概那么个意思）\n\n举例来说，luna如果没有背后的生态支持（部分韩国人基于支付应用使用$UST），axie没有背后的游戏支持，它们就是一个纯粹的空盘子，怎么不算是骗局？但仅仅因为axie与luna的衰落就把原因直观归结到庞氏的逻辑上，这真是世界上最容易的推理之一了。为何不再多做一点研究，去找到他们在**模型调控上的不足**呢？\n\n我的观点是，如果创始团队一开始就打算割韭菜或者最后跑路了，你完全可以说这是骗局；如果创始团队在想办法做一些有意义的事情，你当然也可以说它是庞氏（毕竟在我眼里，庞氏是中性词）；但如果一些确实创造了价值的东西仍旧被fud庞氏，谁还敢去做产品呢？\n\n举个例子，新鲜出炉的stepn。庞氏吗？庞氏。骗局吗？母鸡啊。有意义吗？有意义。它让web3更出圈，也能让很多人逐渐培养起运动习惯（相关心理学分析见[这里](https://mirror.xyz/jojonas1.eth/ruvtu2SfoMAXwQLIlLaxF0rFSUUdq1ekzo3dABvJvHQ)）。当然，有的人觉得stepn如果崩盘会让更多小白对web3产生偏见，那他为什么不担心NFT炒作呢？为什么不觉得DeFi挖矿砸韭菜呢？为什么不担心自己投的项目被二级市场接盘呢？说到底都是资金的流转，如果因为这个否定一切，别参与就好……\n\n以上建立在项目创始团队真心想做好自己在做的事情的前提。关于庞氏我下一部分会做更深入的探讨。\n\n## 现代经济与庞氏\n\n我之前写过一篇有关货币的[文章](https://mirror.xyz/jojonas1.eth/Qomo_pHM27lD4j1Fg4y83-mPCMHgpck6x2gowPmYkh8)， 简言之，法币基于人民对国家权力的共识，可以由国家权力无抵押地印出；而印钱是国家调节经济的必要手段，但也造成了通胀（对所有系统内参与者收取的铸币税），这种铸币税的收取是不均匀的。新印出的钱经由银行系统与产业链一步步流通入社会，在这个过程中，拥有寻租权的个体获得了更多的分配，因此铸币税实际是极其不均匀的。不均匀的铸币税意味着利益受损者在为得利者“接盘”，得利者作为先进入“资金游戏”的角色，提前占据了游戏资源，后来者用自己的钱为之接盘，典型的庞氏特征。\n\n从这个角度来说，很多现实世界的经济行为，不管看起来多么光鲜亮丽、名正言顺，本质逻辑与庞氏如出一辙。\n\n比如国债，基于国家信用，让未来接盘现在，如果不是对国家未来有信心，还想着买来避险？\n\n比如次贷危机中，通过多级衍生品叠加，转移风险，你华丽抽身了，不是因为交易对手方接了盘？交易对手难道不是聪明人？\n\n比如养老，持续几十年投资之后持续获得收益，用这一代人交的钱去养上一代的老人，和用新投资者的钱支付老投资者收益有区别吗？\n\n比如二级交易市场，谁不指望币/股票涨价后派出？涨价后卖出=交易对手方接盘，没有问题吧？\n\n比如房地产与土地财政，难道不是人民为国家的经济建设、后来者为先来者买单？\n\n说到底，还是在于事情本身有没有价值，在于其从一开始是否就是骗局。**把庞氏挂在口边，这是一件每个人都可以做的事情，但找出背后逻辑的共性与不同，分辨事物存在的意义，却被很多人忽视了**。\n\n事实上，**经济系统的每一个节点要想谋利，都必须进行低买高卖的交易，如此，前一人获取的利益必然来自于后一人，这就是交易**；经济系统之所以稳定运转，是因为这样的交易通过循环完成了首尾连接，而生产活动带来的物质增量又在源源不断进出系统平复波动。想要做到这一点，**系统本身要足够庞大、参与者之间的连接度要足够复杂，系统也需要与外界做出足够的价值交换**。如果抛开这些因素，和庞氏难道不是同一个逻辑吗？\n\n真正的项目，会将事情做好，将自己的愿景实现，从而画出一个大饼交接给下一棒。做风投期待被投企业上市；搞创作的希望自己的IP能被影视公司翻拍，都是一个道理。**Yuga labs的猴子，一路接盘到NFT领域的top1，如果最终不落脚到IP、落脚到元宇宙建设，难道不是不停地在存量里来回地割**？\n\n**庞氏从来是手段而非目的**。至少我自己不会因为一个项目拥有旁氏的设计逻辑而去否定它，我会先体验它的产品，找出其不足，想办法去避免或者改进；如果产品无法满足我的使用需求，也不会变得更好，我直接就长按卸载；如果看到其中存在的风险，我也一定会提出自己的逻辑去揭示它，理性表达自己的观点，这有很难吗？\n\n呼天喊地骂旁氏的人，你们真的在担心那些对此没有概念的人的资产损失吗？\n\n## 如何判断tokenomics的好坏？\n\n前面说太多了，后面就简便一点。\n\n### token的激励设计是否合理，被激励者是否真正做出了贡献？\n\n举例来说，大部分DeFi协议对LP提供基于LP额度的激励，LP提供的流动性越多，其激励越多。它们都忽视了一个问题，LP仅仅为项目的启动与发展做出了贡献，却没有为项目稳定做出贡献；一旦LP决定离开，矿币砸盘毁灭的是整个项目的根基，就会殃及其他参与者。为何不对这些足以影响项目稳定的激励做出限制？是怕LP不来？如果产品本身没有吸引LP的地方，开发它做什么呢？\n\n### token抛压是否有解决/抑制措施？\n\n这是大部分项目忽视的问题。很多白皮书里甚至根本不考虑token抛压，只会说用户如何如何会获得奖励，这让我特别好奇他们背后是不是印钞机。如果token抛压得不到解决，马斯克都不够薅的吧？\n\n那么接住抛压这股力量来自于哪里呢？就来自于用户对产品的真实使用需求。举例来说，目前很多未发币的优秀产品其实都已经拥有不错的收入，比如magic eden、nansen等；当用户使用产品服务时需要支付token，或者把产品收入的一部分回流到token之上，是否会对token的抛压有所支撑？所以我一直说，产品的实用性（或者说游戏的可玩性）才是第一，产品不好用，就成了价值净流出的标的，头毛都给你薅秃掉。\n\n### token是否实现了价值流转？\n\n什么叫token的价值流转？把系统中的每个参与者都堪称一个小黑箱，针对这些黑箱有价值的流入与流出，黑箱之间相互连接，完成价值的流转；特定的黑箱再与外界实现双向流转——因为封闭小系统难以持续存在的。\n\n举例来说，大多数成熟的公链代币，便具有完整的价值流转过程。公链生态越成熟，流转过程越复杂，系统的鲁棒性就越好。你可以预料到，大多数人入金后一定会选择某个公链代币，他不可能把U提到链上然后干等着U自己变多……从这个角度来说，很多上线后就一蹶不振的产品，去看他们的经济系统设计，项目缺乏价值输入，好家伙，一直流出再猛的猛男也撑不住啊……\n\n话说回来，价值输入有很多方式，你可以toB，可以是用户行为的大量积累（这来自于产品本身的实用性），也可以是用户掏钱（被大家诟病的庞氏）。价值输入没有好坏，只要和价值输出保持动态的平衡就好。\n\n### token与产品的结合程度如何？\n\n有些项目的设计很简洁，token作为激励代币，除去治理之外没有其他功能。既然如此，直接撇开token直接奖励U不好吗？有人说这我好像在哪见过——这不就是web2烧钱抢客户吗？人家烧钱是为了抢市场，好在战胜所有竞争对手后独吞市场红利；你把token给人砸了，砸完没事了，这个token的意义在哪呢？\n\n好的token设计，一定要用户“睹币思dapp“，并且他还知道你这个token在应用里到底是干什么的。如果是激励代币（应用内实用代币）与治理代币分开的双代币模型，就需要注意二者的交叉地带，能够清晰划分出对应的职责；如果是单代币模型，就更需要注意，代币本身就是项目的符号，如果代币在应用内都是鸡肋，就别怪应用在生态里面也鸡肋了……\n\n### 用户角色区分\n\n你能通过token机制推导出用户的大致行为路径吗？\n\n这是一个很重要的点，即在经济模型设计前，就需要大概界定参与产品的用户群体到底有哪些？真实用户需不需要分类？除去真实用户，套利者、流动性提供者、项目共建者等是否都是重要角色？他们在产品内的行为路径是什么样子的？该怎样结合token设计去做对应的引导？这些角色又分别会对系统产生怎样的价值输入与输出？不同的情形下，他们会怎么对待手中的token？\n\n……\n\n这些东西如果都有头绪，并且清楚突发事件如何调整应对的，才能够去谈如何维持经济系统的稳定。否则，你对自己的项目，对项目的token根本没有调控能力，只能眼睁睁看着他被炒作或者被砸穿。\n\n## 最后几个强调的点\n\n### 产品的本质是要服务于人，token绝不应代替之\n\n通证（token）本质上是一个激励手段，而不是产品接口。独立于产品的tokenomics设计是不具有任何意义的。**决定一个产品命运的，应该是它解决了市场/人的什么需求，带来了什么积极的改变**，而不是他能赚钱or whatever。Token为此服务，但绝不喧宾夺主。\n\n### NFT在web3产品设计中扮演着不可或缺的作用\n\nNFT在经济系统中的一个重要作用，在于蓄水。当然，如果没有真实需求，早晚有一点会水漫金山。所以我强调产品的“实用性“。纵然有实用性，也要注意价格上的管控，不宜被炒作，参见各地房地产泡沫。\n\nNFT作为项目的蓄水资产，必须赋予其生息功能，否则不对用户具备吸引。生息有几点需要强调：\n\n**可持续性**。过高APY是不现实的，过低APY难以吸引用户。建议显性APY与隐性APY结合的方式，前者符合现实生产规律，后者则应用于产品内部，提升使用体验。\n\n**边际递减**。必须强调这一点。现实世界里机器有折旧，有突然损坏，NFT却可以生息一直到game over？建议对NFT增加寿命功能，越老的NFT生息的显性APY越少，隐性APY越多，用以调节系统稳定。否则迟早game over。\n\n**NFT自身拓展**。NFT本身需要是个有生命力的东西，不能是死物，如果是把钥匙，那多么没意思；可如果是个小人，你如果喜欢小人，可以复投升级、换装之类的，提升token需求的同时也获得消费心理满足。当然，小人太突兀的话换成其他东西一样的。\n\n### web3产品一定要帮助用户赚钱吗？不\n\nTokenomics的存在似乎为很多人带来一份错觉，即认为所有的web3产品都可以为他们带来物质利益。实际上，对于任何小系统而言，金钱从来不是无源之水，将重点放在人人赚钱的叙事之上，最后的结果难免会是一地鸡毛。Token应该首先作为引导手段，引导项目方、用户去将这个市场整个生态建设地更好，其次它才是一份给予贡献者的奖励。当然，聪明的投机者可以在任何地方套利。\n\n如果不能帮人赚钱，怎么吸引早期用户呢？\n\n这个得看取舍了。不一定并非一定不。如果对产品没有自信，想要靠x-to-earn打开市场的话，就需要确保自己拥有调控与收束的能力，不然沦为纯粹的资金盘可没有好处。\n\n### token设计需要与产品设计结合\n\n要融入产品设计的细节。比如，套利者轻轻松松就能套利？那不行。设置障碍。设置完之后套利者还是可以套利，但他对系统做出贡献了，或者付出成本了（价值流入-价值流出）。当然，如果系统主要依赖于套利者，这可行不通（比如luna-ust）。比如一款阅读产品，用户可以通过增添LP的方式来解锁小说，相当于把流动性激励转化为章节阅读费用。等。\n\n要考虑到产品生命周期。举例来说，对产品的用户增长预期是什么样？拿比较经典的s曲线来说，如果是stepn的设计，在中间的快速增长阶段是否有必须要做的事情？就我个人看来，快速增长期进入的大量用户会把游戏内资产价格炒高，而这群人之后的回本期望却落在了最后的缓慢增长阶段，自然会引起相关的暴涨暴跌、共识破裂。\n\n有没有办法呢？首先思考的是，有没有办法在s曲线的快速增长阶段后解决矿币抛压。用户有意愿销毁更多矿币吗？还是靠更多新玩法？这些销毁行为的引导，可否针对早期早已完成回本、形成用户粘性、迫切想体会新玩法的那部分玩家？可否针对巨鲸去增加他们销毁矿币的意愿？等。如果没有办法，那么我就想办法控制用户增长曲线，我不让s曲线发生，快速增长？不可能的。系统稳定第一。这些都可以是思路，axie就败在了这一步。\n\n暂时说这么多。Jokenomics以后会诈尸式更新代币经济学相关内容，欢迎关注。\n\ntwitter：@jokenomicser\n\n最后画一张图吧：\n\n![心理学谓之“自验预言”，希望大家不要陷入逻辑自循环的怪圈里](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LkQTFajxdsSxmcISzDPnJ.jpg?height=505&width=600)\n\n[Jokenomics01: 关于luna-ust的一些思考](https://mirror.xyz/jojonas1.eth/vu5gzDXXRJFVZQuGbt7X2IM26XQZiT4LjtfWZTcSbz4)",

{"id": "zSGyh2obqj0FKHiSgBcX1I6tUNaOMGj6bq9GqczAwrg", "title": "DeFi协议的去中心化迷思", "body": "最近，Uniswap面临[集体诉讼](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/141853/class-action-lawsuit-accuses-uniswap-labs-its-investors-of-allowing-fraudulent-activity-on-the-dex-protocol)一事受到大量外界关注。Uniswap创始人Hayden Adams、公司（Universal Navigation Inc.）以及Uniswap背后的投资人，在纽约南区法院遭到起诉，被指控“非法推广、提供、出售未经注册的证券”，以及未按监管要求验证用户身份。此外，无损彩票协议PoolTogether（据称由PoolTogether Inc.运营）也在纽约面临类似的[集体诉讼](https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-savings-lawsuit-puts-principles-of-defi-to-the-test-11642069806)。大家关注的核心问题是：像Uniswap这样的去中心化金融工具是否该承担责任，以及由谁来承担责任。\n\n这意味着一些去中心化金融协议（DeFi Protocol）开始面临着法律上的挑战，尤其是关于它们的去中心化属性。从法律上来看，这些运营实体可能会提出的辩护理由之一是：这些DeFi协议是去中心化的，因此它们不应该对DeFi协议的使用方式负责。本文要探讨的问题是：从法律角度来看，这些DeFi平台到底有多去中心化？\n\n截至2022年5月初（UST-Luna崩盘发生之前）本文根据DeFiLama的锁仓数据（TVL），挑选了七个较为知名的DeFi协议平台，这些DeFi协议的用户条款（Terms & Conditions）均在其网站上发布，这些可能会对DeFi协议和其背后的法律实体之间的关系带来一些启示。\n\n## DeFi协议背后的法律实体\n\n![DeFi协议与其背后的运营法律实体](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HYDqG_rzFjAjQvDbR9QW3.png?height=948&width=1516)\n\n在这七个DeFi协议中，有五个披露了相关法律实体的名称。Curve Governance和Maker Governance的条款没有命名任何实体，这可能是因为这些条款更多的是与DAO治理有关，而不是与DeFi协议的运作有关。下文也会主要围绕这五个DeFi协议展开分析。\n\n## 法律实体和DeFi协议间的关系\n\n在研究了这些条款的文本后，人们可能会发现，大多数法律实体声称它们是独立于底层的DeFi协议的，理由是后者是部署在区块链网络上的。下面是对一些条款的粗略翻译：\n\n* Aave用户协议：“Avara UI Labs Ltd.提供有关去中心化协议基本原理的信息和资源。条款中的 \"服务 \"包括提供对网站的访问、应用程序和网站上出现的信息。”\n* Anchor用户协议：“Terraform Labs PTE, Ltd.提供一个用户界面，该界面提供对去中心化协议的访问。这些条款适用于界面的使用，包括在Anchor网站上提供的所有产品、服务、工具和信息。”\n* dYdX用户协议：“dYdX Trading Inc.为用户提供访问dYdX的网站。这些条款规定了授予使用该网站访问dYdX的智能合约去中心化的应用程序和其他dYdX开发的软件。”\n* Lido用户协议：“DeFi Ltd. 提供了一个网站托管的用户界面，该界面提供了对去中心化协议的访问。”\n* Uniswap用户协议：“Uniswap Labs (Universal Navigation Inc.) 提供了一个网站托管的用户界面，该界面提供了对去中心化协议的访问。这些条款适用于该界面的访问和使用。”\n\n这些条款大多规定了它们网站或界面的使用或访问方式，从而勾勒了如下的一个法律实体、网站界面和DeFi协议之间的关系。\n\n![法律实体提供接入网站界面的权限，网站界面提供接入DeFi协议的权限](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KaDTegx4CvSE-mAHqVWef.png?height=68&width=468)\n\n在这种安排下，似乎法律实体对DeFi协议的控制程度部分取决于它运营的网站使用界面（interface）是否是通往协议的唯一入口。如果法律实体是相关网站界面接入权限的***唯一***提供者，而网站界面又是DeFi协议接入权限的***唯一***提供者，那么可以说法律实体本身能够决定用户是否可以接入该DeFi协议。然而Aave似乎是一个例外，它的条款规定：\"Aave.com不是Aave协议的可用接入点之一\"。\n\n![能否使用其他渠道接入DeFi协议——可能会是决定去中心化程度的重要因素](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8rdAYDPDFk4ZIgR4P-ArD.png?height=125&width=468)\n\n除了对接入权限的控制，还有其他因素可能与法律实体对DeFi协议的控制程度有关，其中一些因素已在针对Uniswap的集体诉讼中提出。\n\n* 该法律实体可以从DeFi协议中获得多少利润。\n* 该法律实体是否可以单方面改变DeFi协议的运作，例如下架权证（token）或暂停提供衍生品。\n* 该法律实体是否拥有对DeFi协议或底层业务的知识产权。\n* DeFi协议的治理结构（前提是存在治理权证）。例如，Uniswap案件的原告诉称，Uniswap的 \"所有者 \"拥有超过40%的UNI权证，因此他们可以根据治理规则'有效控制Uniswap的治理'。\n\n其中一些因素也已经反映在这些协议的条款中。例如，dYdX的法律实体dYdX Trading Inc.有权更新其开发的dYdX智能合约，修改对相关服务的接入权限，并自行决定暂停或禁用其服务。此外，Aave、Anchor和Lido背后的法律实体可以全权决定限制用户对其服务的访问，特别是在有任何可疑的非法活动的时候。\n\n## DeFi协议真的是无需许可的吗？\n\n“无需许可” （permissionless）是许多人眼中去中心化区块链的一大特征，这意味着所有用户都可以无需权限的读写区块链上的内容。与此相对的是“需许可”（permissioned）的区块链，这通常意味着任何对于链上的行为操作都需要网络所有者的权限许可。因此，“去中心化” 和 “无需许可” 往往被视为相互关联的两大属性。然而，当我们观察那些运行在无需许可的公链DeFi协议上时，我们也能得出DeFi协议是无需许可的吗？\n\n答案似乎是否定的，上述这些法律条款和安排的解读，都让人怀疑DeFi的无需许可程度。本文的一个初步观察是：尽管许多区块链网络（如许多公链）是无需许可的，但DeFi协议却并非完全如此。\n\n许多DeFi协议的条款规定，它们只对\"合资格的用户\"开放，尽管目前的门槛往往很低（用户资格要求通常与年龄、法律行为能力和制裁名单有关）。某些DeFi协议，例如dYdX，明确拒绝向美国居民提供服务（可能是由于监管原因）。此外，如上所述，运作网页界面的法律实体也可能有能力在DeFi协议中去屏蔽某些用户或交易。试想一下，如果一个DeFi协议运营方有权限去主动去屏蔽或阻止某些用户的交易行为，这是否让我们觉得似曾相识呢？\n\n所以从这个角度来看，这些主流DeFi协议和传统银行之间的区别，并不是性质上的天壤之别，而只是程度上的区别（门槛高低）——因为基于相关法律，两者都会对其对手方（用户）的资格有一定的要求。这就像我们去传统银行开户，需要签署几十页长的开户文件，也需要向银行提供我们的个人信息，以供银行审查自己可否满足开户要求。DeFi协议也有类似的安排，只不过它们将这种安排放在了网页角落的法律条款之中。尽管如此，人们仍然可以期待DeFi有潜力为那些没有机会接受银行服务的人群（unbanked polulations）提供更便利的金融服务。\n\n## 结语：DeFi协议的控制权之辩\n\n这些DeFi网站上公布的条款表明了法律运营实体和底层DeFi协议之间的关系并不明确。对这一问题的评估可能会需要考虑包括治理结构、利润流向和知识产权在内的因素（注：这不是一个穷尽的清单）。考虑到现有的法律框架倾向于寻找到一个能对行为负责的主体，我们或许可以在智能合约和人工智能（AI）算法之间建立一个类比关系，以获得一些有用的指引。对于人工智能，欧盟专家委员会曾[指出](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/621926/IPOL_STU(2020)621926_EN.pdf)，最有能力控制和管理人工智能的一方，应该对其行为负责。相应的，运营实体能对DeFi协议有多大的控制权，预计会成为未来DeFi相关法律诉讼的核心问题。\n\n作者：Troyso (Tromso) 是香港的一名法律工作者，关注法律和金融领域的Web3创新，本文仅为个人学术观点探讨。本人推特@Troyso_tech，即刻@Troyso。\n\n[https://twitter.com/Troyso_tech/status/1505542398608216065?s=20&t=NSp2GcjpAkiCSuM8llUtZw](https://twitter.com/Troyso_tech/status/1505542398608216065?s=20&t=NSp2GcjpAkiCSuM8llUtZw)\n\n本文是基于作者本人在BanklessDAO Legal Newsletter (Decentralized Law) 发布的英文文章 “Putting the Decentralized in DeFi” 翻译而来，并经过部分编辑，原文链接如下：\n\n[https://banklessdao.substack.com/p/decentralized-finance-decentralized?r=elwu6&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web](https://banklessdao.substack.com/p/decentralized-finance-decentralized?r=elwu6&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)\n\n本人另一篇在Decentralized Law发布的英文文章 “Tokenized Arbitration Funding May Be the Future of Disputes Finance”，探讨了利用发行权证进行仲裁融资的可能性：\n\n[https://banklessdao.substack.com/p/crypto-and-war-decentralized-law?s=r](https://banklessdao.substack.com/p/crypto-and-war-decentralized-law?s=r)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654324663, "digest": "h34O8Sx_mZShws_6cOXbIywNKV3gmlcY7ZBGHQ4xo48", "contributor": "0xc29249BE70ca601934c8250373203AC03C01C3B3"}

Many of them don’t work seamlessly to their full potential as they should and that is the problem we will look into.\n\n## So what can the Tech industry do to solve it ??\n\nThe first thing to do is to be inspired by “The Apple philosophy”. Apple has been consistently producing consumer-grade products that **integrate** with all their devices without any hassle. And that provides a smooth user experience, which is so crucial in today’s ever-evolving, technology-driven modern world. They enhance the user experience by making the connectivity between their accessories and products a breeze.\n\nThis is all credited to the W1 chipset, T1, and all the same chipsets they put in each of their devices for the effortless switching between Macbook to iPhone to Apple Watch to their new Airpods Pro.\n\n![Apple Lineup which offers seamless connectivity](https://miro.medium.com/max/963/1\\*CHZVBxivJNA68vuavg3GQA.jpeg)\n\n## So why haven’t other companies adopted this methodology?\n\nThe simple answer to that is that they don’t have their ecosystem set up. However much they try, they are always going to be playing second fiddle to Apple.\n\nThe good news though, is that third party manufacturers have a golden chance to grab this market. They can create devices that offer a seamless connection between 2 products of different companies. This will offer an experience that only Apple products could previously offer.\n\n## We will take an example of a similar product: These are the new Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z\n\n![Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z — Moving in the right direction](https://miro.medium.com/max/730/1\\*aQmHY6oE3VBsKuULty4y4g.png)\n\nYou might think these are just another pair of Bluetooth earphones. Yes, they are, but with a special button. **And that button is what sets it apart and makes the experience of using your existing devices more special than before**.\n\nThere is a button on the neckband which is for quickly switching between 2 devices. You can do it just by double-clicking the button. It is a feature that is better implemented on the Apple side of things where the AirPods auto-detect the device with sound output and auto-switch to it, but this earphone’s quick switch feature is certainly taking us nearer to that level of an ideal experience.\n\nThis pair of earphones has made us realize the importance of a product that makes the experience of using other devices around your joy. Similar products by third-party vendors should be manufactured as this is the perfect time to intermingle all these products together and bring them under one umbrella.\n\nThese nifty tricks up the sleeve of Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z have made me brainstorm about where the tech industry is moving towards. And I am concluding with the following statement:\n\n# There is going to be an influx of new tech products, but only those who offer a superior experience with products of different origins too, will survive and others would slowly fade away.\n\nWritten with ❤️ by Eshaan Khurana\n\nConstructive criticism/appreciation is welcomed!\n\nConnect with me on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/eshaan-khurana) for more insightful conversations.\n\nIf this feels like a person you want to work with, please shoot me an email at [eshaany2k@gmail.com](https://mailto:eshaany2k@gmail.com) \n ", "timestamp": 1654324842, "digest": "pxWDBHZFkif-tbUBI8WdlTDMpQo0GZclvlArCaNe8kc", "contributor": "0x43187f2d6534D836210720228421Aa73efcD2dC4"}

This ERC20 vault token represents ownership over the NFTs and can be used anytime to redeem an NFT from the vault (1 vault token = 1 NFT). This provides quick liquidity because after depositing, users can swap the token on any AMM such as SushiSwap.\n\n## Bootstrapping the project\n\nThe project was bootstrapped using **[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/index.html)** a day before the airdrop. Due to the time constraints, I was not able to optimize and fine-tune the contract to my liking but it got the job done in the end.\n\n#### The execution flow can be summarized as the following :\n\n* Monitor mempool for when airdrop is live\n* Initiate a zero fee flash mint from NFTX to mint vDoodle tokens\n* Use the vDoodle tokens to redeem 10 doodles from the NFTX vault\n* Use the 10 doodles to claim the Dooplicator airdrop\n* Return all 10 doodles back to the NFTX vault to regain some vDoodle tokens\n* Use SushiSwap to buyback all lost vDoodle tokens due to redeeming fees\n* Return the full amount of minted vDoodle tokens back to NFTX\n* Calculate the ids of the Dooplicators claimed off-chain and then withdraw them from the custom contract\n\nIn order for the Flash Claim to be successful, all steps outlined above (besides the last one) need to happen all in one function call.\n\n> This project was inspired by **[Anish’s FlashSide contracts](https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/flashside)**\n\n### Setting Up The vDoodle Flash Mint\n\nTo be able to claim doodles from the vault, our custom smart contract needs to accumulate a large sum of vDoodle tokens. Instead of taking a FlashLoan from Aave (0.09% fee) or performing a FlashSwap (AMM swap fees), I used **NFTX’s Flash Mint module** which is a function directly forked from [MakerDao’s Dai](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/flash-mint-module). I was able to mint the full supply of vDoodle without needing to pay any fees.\n\nNFTX expects the full amount of vDoodle minted/borrowed to be returned at the end of the transaction so that it can be burned. **Otherwise, the execution is reverted.**\n\n![Snippet from my contract that starts the flash mint](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/In2X54OPwjn0nDGqMXNZD.png?height=320&width=951)\n\nThe Flash Mint module is called through the `flashLoan` method and requires the receiving contract to adhere to the ERC3156 standard.\n\n### Redeeming And Claiming\n\nNFTX has two ways to redeem doodles from the vault. The first is a through a **targetted redeem** and the second is a **random redeem**.\n\n* `Targetted Redeem` allows you to choose exactly which NFT ids you want to redeem for a fee of **0.03 vDoodle per redeem** (1.03 vDoodle per doodle)\n* `Random Redeem` randomly redeems a doodle for you from the vault. This option has a fee of **0.02 vDoodle per redeem** (1.02 vDoodle per doodle)\n\n  > Note: 1 vDoodle is equivilant to the floor price of 1 doodles NFT\n\nI went with the **Random Redeem** approach as it is slightly cheaper and I was banking on being one of the first to claim the pool meaning all doodles redeemed could be used to claim a Dooplicator.\n\n![Snippet from my contract where I redeem doodles from the vault and claim the airdrop](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S1TtBJzM7X8-t79_C3U95.png?height=82&width=680)\n\n#### Front Running Protection\n\nThere is a risk of random redeeming as, without any safety measures, my contract could have redeemed 10 doodles that are not eligible for the Dooplicator airdrop if someone managed to front-run my transaction. If this happened, I would still have to pay the fee for redeeming the doodles and would have no Dooplicators to offset this cost.\n\nThis issue was solved, by adding the following require statement.\n\n![Code snippet of contract code containing front running protection](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CTOWVRP7rgAfKs-mO7lsM.png?height=83&width=793)\n\nMy contract will now revert if it randomly redeemed less than 8 airdrop eligible doodles (out of 10). My transaction was also submitted through [FlashBots](https://docs.flashbots.net/) which meant that I **don’t have to pay for any contract reverts** and if it did revert, the **transaction would be submitted again in the next block.**\n\n> I was lucky to have included this check as I had to hotfix my bot due to a parameter miscalculation, this delay allowed someone to flash claim before me. However, I was still able to claim 8 Dooplicators in the end.\n\n### Returning The Loan\n\nThe final part of the execution is to transfer the doodles back to the vault to get back vDoodle tokens. The contract also had to use SushiSwap to rebuy the lost vDoodle amt due to the redeeming fees. This ensures that ***the full amount*** is returned at the end of the Flash Mint callback.\n\n![Snippet from code to return doodles to the vault and calculate buyback amount](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UrBV-IeeUgTgDtrRIMmQx.png?height=164&width=716)\n\n#### Full onchain breakdown of all tokens transferred during the execution\n\n![Transaction overview](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t8Vw4a-4TQWdwrMFAgeIe.png?height=893&width=995)\n\n### Withdrawing Dooplicators\n\nWith the mint amount fully returned, the execution has now been completed, and the **contract now holds 8 dooplicators**. All that is left to be done is to withdraw the dooplicators to an EOA.\n\n**I calculated the claimed Dooplicators tokenId’s off-chain** as the Dooplicator contract implement `ERC721A` which makes calculating tokens that you own **very gas expensive on-chain**. I then sent an array of the claimed Dooplicator ids to a custom withdraw function to move which then moved all dooplicators off the contract.\n\n![Snippet of my contract's withdrawal function](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uBCb-bE_2vFw9VZlHs3oS.png?height=166&width=692)\n\n![Image of the 8 dooplicators claimed](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bCu0IS25xzQ77yuXVt70M.png?height=744&width=1600)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are countless ways that I can think of to optimize this project but given the time constraints, I am happy with how it turned out. In total, I paid \\~7.21Ξ to claim 10 doodles from NFTX (+gas fees), out of the 10 only 8 were eligible for the Dooplicator airdrop. After the airdrop, the floor price of the dooplicators ranged around 3.5Ξ leaving me with a **profit of \\~21Ξ on paper**. Not bad for a quickly bootstrapped project but could have definitely optimized to extract more value from the pool.\n\n…\n\n**If you found this post interesting, you can Link with me on Twitter [@MouseLessDev](https://twitter.com/0xMouseLessDev).

"*（原创内容，如需转载请联系本人推特获得授权，所有权利保留）*\n\n最近，Uniswap面临[集体诉讼](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/141853/class-action-lawsuit-accuses-uniswap-labs-its-investors-of-allowing-fraudulent-activity-on-the-dex-protocol)一事受到大量外界关注。Uniswap创始人Hayden Adams、公司（Universal Navigation Inc.）以及Uniswap背后的投资人，在纽约南区法院遭到起诉，被指控“非法推广、提供、出售未经注册的证券”，以及未按监管要求验证用户身份。此外，无损彩票协议PoolTogether（据称由PoolTogether Inc.运营）也在纽约面临类似的[集体诉讼](https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-savings-lawsuit-puts-principles-of-defi-to-the-test-11642069806)。大家关注的核心问题是：像Uniswap这样的去中心化金融工具是否该承担责任，以及由谁来承担责任。\n\n这意味着一些去中心化金融协议（DeFi Protocol）开始面临着法律上的挑战，尤其是关于它们的去中心化属性。从法律上来看，这些运营实体可能会提出的辩护理由之一是：这些DeFi协议是去中心化的，因此它们不应该对DeFi协议的使用方式负责。本文要探讨的问题是：从法律角度来看，这些DeFi平台到底有多去中心化？\n\n截至2022年5月初（UST-Luna崩盘发生之前）本文根据DeFiLama的锁仓数据（TVL），挑选了七个较为知名的DeFi协议平台，这些DeFi协议的用户条款（Terms & Conditions）均在其网站上发布，这些可能会对DeFi协议和其背后的法律实体之间的关系带来一些启示。\n\n## DeFi协议背后的法律实体\n\n![DeFi协议与其背后的运营法律实体](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HYDqG_rzFjAjQvDbR9QW3.png?height=948&width=1516)\n\n在这七个DeFi协议中，有五个披露了相关法律实体的名称。Curve Governance和Maker Governance的条款没有命名任何实体，这可能是因为这些条款更多的是与DAO治理有关，而不是与DeFi协议的运作有关。下文也会主要围绕这五个DeFi协议展开分析。\n\n## 法律实体和DeFi协议间的关系\n\n在研究了这些条款的文本后，人们可能会发现，大多数法律实体声称它们是独立于底层的DeFi协议的，理由是后者是部署在区块链网络上的。下面是对一些条款的粗略翻译：\n\n* Aave用户协议：“Avara UI Labs Ltd.提供有关去中心化协议基本原理的信息和资源。条款中的 \"服务 \"包括提供对网站的访问、应用程序和网站上出现的信息。”\n* Anchor用户协议：“Terraform Labs PTE, Ltd.提供一个用户界面，该界面提供对去中心化协议的访问。这些条款适用于界面的使用，包括在Anchor网站上提供的所有产品、服务、工具和信息。”\n* dYdX用户协议：“dYdX Trading Inc.为用户提供访问dYdX的网站。这些条款规定了授予使用该网站访问dYdX的智能合约去中心化的应用程序和其他dYdX开发的软件。”\n* Lido用户协议：“DeFi Ltd. 提供了一个网站托管的用户界面，该界面提供了对去中心化协议的访问。”\n* Uniswap用户协议：“Uniswap Labs (Universal Navigation Inc.) 提供了一个网站托管的用户界面，该界面提供了对去中心化协议的访问。这些条款适用于该界面的访问和使用。”\n\n这些条款大多规定了它们网站或界面的使用或访问方式，从而勾勒了如下的一个法律实体、网站界面和DeFi协议之间的关系。\n\n![法律实体提供接入网站界面的权限，网站界面提供接入DeFi协议的权限](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KaDTegx4CvSE-mAHqVWef.png?height=68&width=468)\n\n在这种安排下，似乎法律实体对DeFi协议的控制程度部分取决于它运营的网站使用界面（interface）是否是通往协议的唯一入口。如果法律实体是相关网站界面接入权限的***唯一***提供者，而网站界面又是DeFi协议接入权限的***唯一***提供者，那么可以说法律实体本身能够决定用户是否可以接入该DeFi协议。然而Aave似乎是一个例外，它的条款规定：\"Aave.com不是Aave协议的可用接入点之一\"。\n\n![能否使用其他渠道接入DeFi协议——可能会是决定去中心化程度的重要因素](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8rdAYDPDFk4ZIgR4P-ArD.png?height=125&width=468)\n\n除了对接入权限的控制，还有其他因素可能与法律实体对DeFi协议的控制程度有关，其中一些因素已在针对Uniswap的集体诉讼中提出。\n\n* 该法律实体可以从DeFi协议中获得多少利润。\n* 该法律实体是否可以单方面改变DeFi协议的运作，例如下架权证（token）或暂停提供衍生品。\n* 该法律实体是否拥有对DeFi协议或底层业务的知识产权。\n* DeFi协议的治理结构（前提是存在治理权证）。例如，Uniswap案件的原告诉称，Uniswap的 \"所有者 \"拥有超过40%的UNI权证，因此他们可以根据治理规则'有效控制Uniswap的治理'。\n\n其中一些因素也已经反映在这些协议的条款中。例如，dYdX的法律实体dYdX Trading Inc.有权更新其开发的dYdX智能合约，修改对相关服务的接入权限，并自行决定暂停或禁用其服务。此外，Aave、Anchor和Lido背后的法律实体可以全权决定限制用户对其服务的访问，特别是在有任何可疑的非法活动的时候。\n\n## DeFi协议真的是无需许可的吗？\n\n“无需许可” （permissionless）是许多人眼中去中心化区块链的一大特征，这意味着所有用户都可以无需权限的读写区块链上的内容。与此相对的是“需许可”（permissioned）的区块链，这通常意味着任何对于链上的行为操作都需要网络所有者的权限许可。因此，“去中心化” 和 “无需许可” 往往被视为相互关联的两大属性。然而，当我们观察那些运行在无需许可的公链DeFi协议上时，我们也能得出DeFi协议是无需许可的吗？\n\n答案似乎是否定的，上述这些法律条款和安排的解读，都让人怀疑DeFi的无需许可程度。本文的一个初步观察是：尽管许多区块链网络（如许多公链）是无需许可的，但DeFi协议却并非完全如此。\n\n许多DeFi协议的条款规定，它们只对\"合资格的用户\"开放，尽管目前的门槛往往很低（用户资格要求通常与年龄、法律行为能力和制裁名单有关）。某些DeFi协议，例如dYdX，明确拒绝向美国居民提供服务（可能是由于监管原因）。此外，如上所述，运作网页界面的法律实体也可能有能力在DeFi协议中去屏蔽某些用户或交易。试想一下，如果一个DeFi协议运营方有权限去主动去屏蔽或阻止某些用户的交易行为，这是否让我们觉得似曾相识呢？\n\n所以从这个角度来看，这些主流DeFi协议和传统银行之间的区别，并不是性质上的天壤之别，而只是程度上的区别（门槛高低）——因为基于相关法律，两者都会对其对手方（用户）的资格有一定的要求。这就像我们去传统银行开户，需要签署几十页长的开户文件，也需要向银行提供我们的个人信息，以供银行审查自己可否满足开户要求。DeFi协议也有类似的安排，只不过它们将这种安排放在了网页角落的法律条款之中。尽管如此，人们仍然可以期待DeFi有潜力为那些没有机会接受银行服务的人群（unbanked polulations）提供更便利的金融服务。\n\n## 结语：DeFi协议的控制权之辩\n\n这些DeFi网站上公布的条款表明了法律运营实体和底层DeFi协议之间的关系并不明确。对这一问题的评估可能会需要考虑包括治理结构、利润流向和知识产权在内的因素（注：这不是一个穷尽的清单）。考虑到现有的法律框架倾向于寻找到一个能对行为负责的主体，我们或许可以在智能合约和人工智能（AI）算法之间建立一个类比关系，以获得一些有用的指引。对于人工智能，欧盟专家委员会曾[指出](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/621926/IPOL_STU(2020)621926_EN.pdf)，最有能力控制和管理人工智能的一方，应该对其行为负责。相应的，运营实体能对DeFi协议有多大的控制权，预计会成为未来DeFi相关法律诉讼的核心问题。\n\n作者：Troyso
