{"id": "2GsEhN7mVVKyzU5Cr1shhFAyW1n62oqtNwZbOtlqCms", "title": "Building With Optimism at Decasonic Labs", "body": "**As Bari Weiss put it ever so articulately in *The Case for American Seriousness*: \n * \n “You can’t be an incredible investor if you look at the world with ironic detachment. If you are a naysayer. Or a cynic. Skeptical, yes, of course. But fundamentally you have to believe that individuals with tremendous willpower can do things. Great, shocking, inconceivable things. Like find your husband on your phone. Or build a spaceship to go to another planet. Or create a new currency.”***\n\nThis is an indisputable, capital T, Truth. I have been a venture investor for a very limited amount of time, but if there is anything I’ve learned, it is only and absolutely this. Being an excellent early stage investor definitionally requires taking the future seriously, and as I’ve learned through my life experiences, the future is mostly uncertain, subject to a seemingly infinite amount of variables, and depending on your views, probabilistic. Progress is never clear cut, and as a result finding non-consensus solutions to very large problems can seem like an insurmountable task. Early stage investing requires an incredibly ambitious, yet realistic optimism that is a difficult balance to cultivate.\n\nIn order to develop this mindset, one must acquire a rigorous and analytical way of thinking about things such that you become able to arrive at convincing arguments of a radically more productive, yet probable future. Oftentimes, these views may not be consensus as a result of the subtleties and variance of the paths by which the future can unfold, so one must also develop the nerve to stand on your own two feet.\n\nIf there is a unique mindset that encapsulates the success of Silicon Valley in becoming the mecca of venture capital, it is just this. In the silicon valley of the 2000s, you could find people like John Doerr, Marc Andreessen, and Vinod Khosla who took seemingly absurd conceptions about the future very seriously and labored through the logic of what a highly optimistic and unlikely future might entail in order to reach their own conclusions. Whether it was thinking rigorously in 1996 about a future where one could purchase any product they desire on a single internet website and expect it to arrive at your doorstep within one or two days, envisioning a website that makes the act of complete strangers renting each other their homes entirely mainstream, or conceiving of a future in which most people meet their significant others by swiping on pictures of complete strangers on their smartphones, these investors didn’t just think about the future, they also helped make it come to fruition.\n\nTaking inspiration from the greats in conceiving and building a highly optimistic future, I am proud to announce the summer 2022 launch of Decasonic Labs. At Decasonic Labs, we will be focused on bringing about the vision we have established at Decasonic through rigorous treatment of highly ambitious conceptions of the future. We are hiring for intern and full time positions across software engineering, frontend and backend development, and UX design to partner with the most ambitious builders that want to take the idea of a radically better future as seriously as we do. We will focus on building products that bring blockchain technology to the masses. The infrastructure has been built, but the user experiences and value propositions that drive mainstream adoption have an arduous path to tread. We strive to hold ourselves accountable to our brand as top tier builders and investors, by making tangible contributions to the Web3 ecosystem and pushing forward current boundaries in the user base. Decasonic Labs will be headquartered in Chicago, operating in a hybrid remote/office model such that we can engage in rapid iteration and testing to build the best products possible.\n\nWe strongly believe that embarking on this journey will make us even better investors and drive synergies within our portfolio. It is only by engaging in the arduous trial and failure of incubating companies and building products that one learns the lessons few put in the work to learn. When you’ve built a company you become intimately acquainted with these trials and tribulations, and you can build your own repository of knowledge from these experiences. As a result, we will be able to provide even better advisory to our portfolio companies and empathize with them as they go through the same journey. Furthermore, we are able to build products that create synergies within our portfolio and support our companies through that avenue. Strategically, we see this bear market as an excellent opportunity to act on our conviction by building and preparing for the next bear market with those that know the score will take care of itself.\n\nSo while panic ensues in the broader markets as a result of uncertainty about the macroeconomic future, we build. In the same essay, guest writer, Katherine Boyle states: \n  \n ***“There is no fixed pie when it comes to building. Building is an action, a choice, a decision to create and move. It is shovels in the dirt with a motley crew of doers who get the job done because no one else will. Building is the only certainty. The only thing we can control. When the projects we believed were Teflon strong are fraying like the history they toppled, the only thing to do is to make something new again.”***\n\nWe couldn’t agree more.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1654271765, "digest": "F6K1rd0LB0q4Q7x3vSIgZXYd32ye_2LKWd5qNjforho", "contributor": "0xC962c9262DC388ca0a44000dEae2E45922618366"}

I have been a venture investor for a very limited amount of time, but if there is anything I’ve learned, it is only and absolutely this. Being an excellent early stage investor definitionally requires taking the future seriously, and as I’ve learned through my life experiences, the future is mostly uncertain, subject to a seemingly infinite amount of variables, and depending on your views, probabilistic. Progress is never clear cut, and as a result finding non-consensus solutions to very large problems can seem like an insurmountable task. Early stage investing requires an incredibly ambitious, yet realistic optimism that is a difficult balance to cultivate.\n\nIn order to develop this mindset, one must acquire a rigorous and analytical way of thinking about things such that you become able to arrive at convincing arguments of a radically more productive, yet probable future. Oftentimes, these views may not be consensus as a result of the subtleties and variance of the paths by which the future can unfold, so one must also develop the nerve to stand on your own two feet.\n\nIf there is a unique mindset that encapsulates the success of Silicon Valley in becoming the mecca of venture capital, it is just this. In the silicon valley of the 2000s, you could find people like John Doerr, Marc Andreessen, and Vinod Khosla who took seemingly absurd conceptions about the future very seriously and labored through the logic of what a highly optimistic and unlikely future might entail in order to reach their own conclusions. Whether it was thinking rigorously in 1996 about a future where one could purchase any product they desire on a single internet website and expect it to arrive at your doorstep within one or two days, envisioning a website that makes the act of complete strangers renting each other their homes entirely mainstream, or conceiving of a future in which most people meet their significant others by swiping on pictures of complete strangers on their smartphones, these investors didn’t just think about the future, they also helped make it come to fruition.\n\nTaking inspiration from the greats in conceiving and building a highly optimistic future, I am proud to announce the summer 2022 launch of Decasonic Labs. At Decasonic Labs, we will be focused on bringing about the vision we have established at Decasonic through rigorous treatment of highly ambitious conceptions of the future. We are hiring for intern and full time positions across software engineering, frontend and backend development, and UX design to partner with the most ambitious builders that want to take the idea of a radically better future as seriously as we do. We will focus on building products that bring blockchain technology to the masses. The infrastructure has been built, but the user experiences and value propositions that drive mainstream adoption have an arduous path to tread. We strive to hold ourselves accountable to our brand as top tier builders and investors, by making tangible contributions to the Web3 ecosystem and pushing forward current boundaries in the user base. Decasonic Labs will be headquartered in Chicago, operating in a hybrid remote/office model such that we can engage in rapid iteration and testing to build the best products possible.\n\nWe strongly believe that embarking on this journey will make us even better investors and drive synergies within our portfolio. It is only by engaging in the arduous trial and failure of incubating companies and building products that one learns the lessons few put in the work to learn. When you’ve built a company you become intimately acquainted with these trials and tribulations, and you can build your own repository of knowledge from these experiences. As a result, we will be able to provide even better advisory to our portfolio companies and empathize with them as they go through the same journey.

Protocols and products that create advocates who bring in others because they are convicted will create an essential flywheel of onboarding with a positive feedback loop.\n\nCommunity and in conjunction growth are now an integral part of the fabric of culture in general and in crypto especially. It creates an infinitely scalable opportunity that encompasses anything from marketing activations to technical breakthroughs on a grassroots level.\n\nThis has been my primary focus and a nascent point of excitement since I entered crypto in 2020 and I aim to have the privilege of working on it as long as I can.\n\n![(ignore the above meme - I actually do stuff outside of making memes) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vrOr0vJUWjjDe8V_H4p00.png?height=499&width=517)\n\n**So, what does my role look like?**\n\nAs Head of Community and Growth, I’ll be working directly with portfolio companies to create uniquely personalized journeys for the founders we work with.\n\nI’ll be doing this by examining what the founders want for their community of users, brainstorming what long term growth might look like with each company, and working with other parts of Chapter One (Founder Experience, Talent and Education, Research and Experiments) to create the most holistic experience for Chapter One’s portfolio.\n\nIn addition, I’m excited to dive into developing and curating resources surrounding community, growth, and business development and open-sourcing anything I find for the public good. Long term, I hope to build robust connections within the space to generate content that helps surface best practices for decentralized communities, internal and external, as well as scalable GTM playbooks for companies of all shapes and sizes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MDeBKe1oIdvwb5ZBjog0Z.png?height=500&width=1000)\n\n**What brought me here?**\n\nI’ve always been a big believer in trying and experiencing first before judging. This has brought me on a wild journey where I submerged myself into different fields from the government defense industry, airline industry, spatial work startups, to multi-billion hedge funds — ultimately landing in crypto where I now call home.\n\nI think it would be remiss to not highlight a few formative experiences below.\n\n* **Delta** ✈️ - my first job as a sophomore in college.\n  * From the first day where I could barely figure my way around the spreadsheet maze, to my last month (a year and a half later) where I was responsible for staffing entire airports on my own using scripts and processes I had worked on. Oh yea, also the free flights worldwide, those were nice.\n* **Zeet** 💻 - my first introduction to startups.\n  * This job was an important view into how a good leader can unlock and empower someone to achieve much more than they could ever imagine. Here I was able to self-start, own, and execute high-leverage projects with little oversight and a lot of encouragement. Shoutout to Johnny Dallas (+ frens), where without them I for sure wouldn’t be where I am now.\n* **Branch** ✨ - my first FT(ish) job.\n  * This job gave me the first glimpse into the serendipity that could be possible in the metaverse. Being a Customer Success Manager I was able to see the direct impact my interactions could have in a B2B/B2C context as well as how important education was for a product regardless of how intuitive it might seem, an essential lesson, especially in crypto.\n* **Special mention to D.E. Shaw**🏦 - a look into the trad-fi void.\n  * This gave me an intimate inside look into the vast world of finance that remains abysmally archaic for the everyday person. From learning about how markets were made to the complex technical systems that facilitate the millisecond trades executed on a day-to-day basis. This look behind the curtain gave me the push I needed to finally land me permanently into crypto.\n\nFinding myself glued to everything crypto. It led me down a rabbit hole of learning and finding what I was passionate about (memes, people, and data) which dropped me right into the team @ Rainbow Wallet🌈 . Here I spent my time at Rainbow dreaming of ways to help onboard the next generation of crypto users through an accessible interface as simple but impactful as a crypto wallet.\n\nBut with Rainbow being my *Chapter Zero*, a proverbial foreword to my ongoing and seemingly never-ending adventure in crypto, I’m super thrilled to begin *Chapter One* of my crypto journey with an amazing team, and even more importantly the amazing community of crypto that has brought me to where I am.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n34OYKT8Y6MmXuU9iZLvC.png?height=500&width=666)\n\n**Let’s Connect!**\n\nThe next few months are going to be fast paced, productive, and invigorating which I can’t wait to lean into and bring y’all on the ride as well. I’m always looking for more people to vibe on crazy ideas with and chat about community, growth, biz dev, and anything meme-related in crypto.

No-one before had imagined that a blockchain can be attacked and forced to be halted. \n\n \n Well that’s what happened to the **TERRA** network. Its native token LUNA lost 100% of its value.\n\n![LUNA Market history over past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_a6dKTArZU9hpPtcX9tbV.png?height=382&width=488)\n\n## Stable Coins\n\nThere are two types of currencies in blockchain, one that you want to increase in prices i.e. the native tokens so that you can gain high ROI’s e.g. Ether, BTC etc. Other one is stable-coins, you want these to stay near 1$ i.e. their initial pegging. They are programmed in such a way that they stay low. They are considered the safe channel if you want to go long on your assets. For a better understanding, you can relate them with government securities in terms of traditional trading, they don’t offer high ROI’s but profits are guaranteed even if they are low. There are many such tokens as Tether’s USD, or US Center government’s USDC**.** \n\n## UST-LUNA\n\nLike USDT, USDC, **TERRA** network has its own stable-coin UST. Now unlike other stable-coins, which are backed up by liquidity in form of real money in the banks, UST is an algorithmically stable coin. Do Kwon, founder of the Terra network, designed this token. As per the theory, UST is 1:1 pegged to Terra’s LUNA. It means UST holders can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA by burning the UST and minting LUNA.\n\n## Attack Phase -1\n\nUST doesn’t have any other utility other than Terra’s most popular [Anchor Protocol](https://www.anchorprotocol.com/#). Anchor offers 20% yield for deposits, this is far more than any other protocol. But this deal is only effective to the UST, no other stable-coins, be it USDC, USDT. \n\nAs per April end, 72% of all the UST was locked into Anchor, estimated around 14 billion dollars.\n\nImagine a bank offering 20% interest on your deposits, obviously everyone would go to that bank and earn that pretty money. That’s what happened with Anchor, as the time passed, the number of lenders increased, but the number of borrowers kept decreasing, in this case a proposal was drawn and it was clear that those pretty 20% interest rates were not going to stand. \n\nAfter hearing the news, people started pulling their locked UST out from Anchor. Since there is no other use of UST, people started getting out of the Terra network\n\n[Anchor Docs](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/)\n\n## Attack Phase -2\n\nNow to exit UST, there are two options, one- the inbuilt burn and mint mechanism, where one can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA, Second option is stable-coin exchange, Curve Finance.\n\nCurve provides liquidity pools for stable coins, same existed for UST too, specifically (UST+3crv pool).\n\nWhen people took out their UST they started swapping it into the curve pool. It increased the amount of UST and decreased the amount of other stable-coins, resulting in the destabilization of the pool.  \n\nTo make things worse, at least one individual dumped about $85 Million worth UST tokens, and exchanged them for USDC. This created an imbalance in the pool. Now to tip the scales back, according to the protocols, Anchor starts offering UST at a discounted price. This was the initial step in de-pegging of UST. This eventually resulted in the drowning of LUNA in the market.\n\n![Transaction showing deposit of $85 Million worth UST](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8i8MY1SsFCuLvCtGvj89p.png?height=390&width=600)\n\n## Attack Phase -3\n\nNow every blockchain has a safe guard which steps in at the moment of crisis. Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) was Terra’s shield in this case. It dumped non-UST stable-coins worth approximately $216 Million into the curve pool to regain the balance. This technique did work for sometime but the prices continued to degrade as people continued to get out of Terra. Panic played a crucial role in the plummeting of the Market, traders/investors lost their trust in Terra. \n\nNow to compensate for the loss in the portfolios, people started selling their other assets to absorb the shock. This resulted in the falling of the market altogether.\n\nDo Kwon had already thought about any incident of such kind, some time later after launching UST, he started buying Bitcoin as safe reserves. But those reserves were not enough to compensate for the destruction.\n\nThis kind of attack forced the blockchain to halt, a decision collectively taken by all the nodes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter the whole month of analyzing , it’s safe to say that we still are at a very early stage, there’s a lot to learn, a lot to unravel, a lot to study. One has to take every step very cautiously because it’s real money at stake here. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1654273711, "digest": "Xup_PA8A5ZGz0bA_7TKb8sp8GgSPuJWSQ-qn00aSnWI", "contributor": "0xC6036B8c3F911f936b661a075CFAA4B802b75cc3"}

We believe in building a “multi-chapter story” with the founders we invest in. We strive to become a venture contributor fund — getting our hands dirty helping on multiple fronts such as Founder Experience, Talent and Education, or Product with founders when they need us.\n\nJeff and Mene have assembled a fantastic group of immensely talented individuals who come from diverse backgrounds — bringing with them an arsenal of incredible experiences that can be immediately applied to the day-to-day work that we do regardless of the scenario thrown at us.\n\nI’m so excited to dive into the themes that Chapter One believes in:\n\n* **Multiplayer Money**: crypto being the foundation of unlocking group coordination\n* **Next Billion Owners:** onboarding the next generation of crypto users\n* **Cult Communities:** a focus point for helping unlock radical thinkers to manifest their ideas\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YFoFewVthgf2WPNL5PTXM.png?height=348&width=717)\n\n**WHY Community and Growth?**\n\nFundamentally, there will come a time when yields taper and the world of crypto no longer flouts outrageous APY's or gains to entice newcomers. Those that continue to evangelize crypto and its community will do it, not because of speculative monetary gains, but because of the right onboarding experience.\n\nI believe that communities that border on cults will help onboard, lock-in, and engage the next generation of crypto natives. Protocols and products that create advocates who bring in others because they are convicted will create an essential flywheel of onboarding with a positive feedback loop.\n\nCommunity and in conjunction growth are now an integral part of the fabric of culture in general and in crypto especially. It creates an infinitely scalable opportunity that encompasses anything from marketing activations to technical breakthroughs on a grassroots level.\n\nThis has been my primary focus and a nascent point of excitement since I entered crypto in 2020 and I aim to have the privilege of working on it as long as I can.\n\n![(ignore the above meme - I actually do stuff outside of making memes) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vrOr0vJUWjjDe8V_H4p00.png?height=499&width=517)\n\n**So, what does my role look like?**\n\nAs Head of Community and Growth, I’ll be working directly with portfolio companies to create uniquely personalized journeys for the founders we work with.\n\nI’ll be doing this by examining what the founders want for their community of users, brainstorming what long term growth might look like with each company, and working with other parts of Chapter One (Founder Experience, Talent and Education, Research and Experiments) to create the most holistic experience for Chapter One’s portfolio.\n\nIn addition, I’m excited to dive into developing and curating resources surrounding community, growth, and business development and open-sourcing anything I find for the public good. Long term, I hope to build robust connections within the space to generate content that helps surface best practices for decentralized communities, internal and external, as well as scalable GTM playbooks for companies of all shapes and sizes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MDeBKe1oIdvwb5ZBjog0Z.png?height=500&width=1000)\n\n**What brought me here?**\n\nI’ve always been a big believer in trying and experiencing first before judging. This has brought me on a wild journey where I submerged myself into different fields from the government defense industry, airline industry, spatial work startups, to multi-billion hedge funds — ultimately landing in crypto where I now call home.\n\nI think it would be remiss to not highlight a few formative experiences below.\n\n* **Delta** ✈️ - my first job as a sophomore in college.\n  * From the first day where I could barely figure my way around the spreadsheet maze, to my last month (a year and a half later) where I was responsible for staffing entire airports on my own using scripts and processes I had worked on. Oh yea, also the free flights worldwide, those were nice.\n* **Zeet** 💻 - my first introduction to startups.\n  * This job was an important view into how a good leader can unlock and empower someone to achieve much more than they could ever imagine. Here I was able to self-start, own, and execute high-leverage projects with little oversight and a lot of encouragement. Shoutout to Johnny Dallas (+ frens), where without them I for sure wouldn’t be where I am now.\n* **Branch** ✨ - my first FT(ish) job.\n  * This job gave me the first glimpse into the serendipity that could be possible in the metaverse. Being a Customer Success Manager I was able to see the direct impact my interactions could have in a B2B/B2C context as well as how important education was for a product regardless of how intuitive it might seem, an essential lesson, especially in crypto.\n* **Special mention to D.E. Shaw**🏦 - a look into the trad-fi void.\n  * This gave me an intimate inside look into the vast world of finance that remains abysmally archaic for the everyday person. From learning about how markets were made to the complex technical systems that facilitate the millisecond trades executed on a day-to-day basis. This look behind the curtain gave me the push I needed to finally land me permanently into crypto.\n\nFinding myself glued to everything crypto. It led me down a rabbit hole of learning and finding what I was passionate about (memes, people, and data) which dropped me right into the team @ Rainbow Wallet🌈 . Here I spent my time at Rainbow dreaming of ways to help onboard the next generation of crypto users through an accessible interface as simple but impactful as a crypto wallet.\n\nBut with Rainbow being my *Chapter Zero*, a proverbial foreword to my ongoing and seemingly never-ending adventure in crypto, I’m super thrilled to begin *Chapter One* of my crypto journey with an amazing team, and even more importantly the amazing community of crypto that has brought me to where I am.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n34OYKT8Y6MmXuU9iZLvC.png?height=500&width=666)\n\n**Let’s Connect!**\n\nThe next few months are going to be fast paced, productive, and invigorating which I can’t wait to lean into and bring y’all on the ride as well. I’m always looking for more people to vibe on crazy ideas with and chat about community, growth, biz dev, and anything meme-related in crypto.
