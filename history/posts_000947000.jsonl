{"id": "2GsEhN7mVVKyzU5Cr1shhFAyW1n62oqtNwZbOtlqCms", "title": "Building With Optimism at Decasonic Labs", "body": "**As Bari Weiss put it ever so articulately in *The Case for American Seriousness*: \n * \n “You can’t be an incredible investor if you look at the world with ironic detachment. If you are a naysayer. Or a cynic. Skeptical, yes, of course. But fundamentally you have to believe that individuals with tremendous willpower can do things. Great, shocking, inconceivable things. Like find your husband on your phone. Or build a spaceship to go to another planet. Or create a new currency.”***\n\nThis is an indisputable, capital T, Truth. I have been a venture investor for a very limited amount of time, but if there is anything I’ve learned, it is only and absolutely this. Being an excellent early stage investor definitionally requires taking the future seriously, and as I’ve learned through my life experiences, the future is mostly uncertain, subject to a seemingly infinite amount of variables, and depending on your views, probabilistic. Progress is never clear cut, and as a result finding non-consensus solutions to very large problems can seem like an insurmountable task. Early stage investing requires an incredibly ambitious, yet realistic optimism that is a difficult balance to cultivate.\n\nIn order to develop this mindset, one must acquire a rigorous and analytical way of thinking about things such that you become able to arrive at convincing arguments of a radically more productive, yet probable future. Oftentimes, these views may not be consensus as a result of the subtleties and variance of the paths by which the future can unfold, so one must also develop the nerve to stand on your own two feet.\n\nIf there is a unique mindset that encapsulates the success of Silicon Valley in becoming the mecca of venture capital, it is just this. In the silicon valley of the 2000s, you could find people like John Doerr, Marc Andreessen, and Vinod Khosla who took seemingly absurd conceptions about the future very seriously and labored through the logic of what a highly optimistic and unlikely future might entail in order to reach their own conclusions. Whether it was thinking rigorously in 1996 about a future where one could purchase any product they desire on a single internet website and expect it to arrive at your doorstep within one or two days, envisioning a website that makes the act of complete strangers renting each other their homes entirely mainstream, or conceiving of a future in which most people meet their significant others by swiping on pictures of complete strangers on their smartphones, these investors didn’t just think about the future, they also helped make it come to fruition.\n\nTaking inspiration from the greats in conceiving and building a highly optimistic future, I am proud to announce the summer 2022 launch of Decasonic Labs. At Decasonic Labs, we will be focused on bringing about the vision we have established at Decasonic through rigorous treatment of highly ambitious conceptions of the future. We are hiring for intern and full time positions across software engineering, frontend and backend development, and UX design to partner with the most ambitious builders that want to take the idea of a radically better future as seriously as we do. We will focus on building products that bring blockchain technology to the masses. The infrastructure has been built, but the user experiences and value propositions that drive mainstream adoption have an arduous path to tread. We strive to hold ourselves accountable to our brand as top tier builders and investors, by making tangible contributions to the Web3 ecosystem and pushing forward current boundaries in the user base. Decasonic Labs will be headquartered in Chicago, operating in a hybrid remote/office model such that we can engage in rapid iteration and testing to build the best products possible.\n\nWe strongly believe that embarking on this journey will make us even better investors and drive synergies within our portfolio. It is only by engaging in the arduous trial and failure of incubating companies and building products that one learns the lessons few put in the work to learn. When you’ve built a company you become intimately acquainted with these trials and tribulations, and you can build your own repository of knowledge from these experiences. As a result, we will be able to provide even better advisory to our portfolio companies and empathize with them as they go through the same journey. Furthermore, we are able to build products that create synergies within our portfolio and support our companies through that avenue. Strategically, we see this bear market as an excellent opportunity to act on our conviction by building and preparing for the next bear market with those that know the score will take care of itself.\n\nSo while panic ensues in the broader markets as a result of uncertainty about the macroeconomic future, we build. In the same essay, guest writer, Katherine Boyle states: \n  \n ***“There is no fixed pie when it comes to building. Building is an action, a choice, a decision to create and move. It is shovels in the dirt with a motley crew of doers who get the job done because no one else will. Building is the only certainty. The only thing we can control. When the projects we believed were Teflon strong are fraying like the history they toppled, the only thing to do is to make something new again.”***\n\nWe couldn’t agree more.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1654271765, "digest": "F6K1rd0LB0q4Q7x3vSIgZXYd32ye_2LKWd5qNjforho", "contributor": "0xC962c9262DC388ca0a44000dEae2E45922618366"}

I have been a venture investor for a very limited amount of time, but if there is anything I’ve learned, it is only and absolutely this. Being an excellent early stage investor definitionally requires taking the future seriously, and as I’ve learned through my life experiences, the future is mostly uncertain, subject to a seemingly infinite amount of variables, and depending on your views, probabilistic. Progress is never clear cut, and as a result finding non-consensus solutions to very large problems can seem like an insurmountable task. Early stage investing requires an incredibly ambitious, yet realistic optimism that is a difficult balance to cultivate.\n\nIn order to develop this mindset, one must acquire a rigorous and analytical way of thinking about things such that you become able to arrive at convincing arguments of a radically more productive, yet probable future. Oftentimes, these views may not be consensus as a result of the subtleties and variance of the paths by which the future can unfold, so one must also develop the nerve to stand on your own two feet.\n\nIf there is a unique mindset that encapsulates the success of Silicon Valley in becoming the mecca of venture capital, it is just this. In the silicon valley of the 2000s, you could find people like John Doerr, Marc Andreessen, and Vinod Khosla who took seemingly absurd conceptions about the future very seriously and labored through the logic of what a highly optimistic and unlikely future might entail in order to reach their own conclusions. Whether it was thinking rigorously in 1996 about a future where one could purchase any product they desire on a single internet website and expect it to arrive at your doorstep within one or two days, envisioning a website that makes the act of complete strangers renting each other their homes entirely mainstream, or conceiving of a future in which most people meet their significant others by swiping on pictures of complete strangers on their smartphones, these investors didn’t just think about the future, they also helped make it come to fruition.\n\nTaking inspiration from the greats in conceiving and building a highly optimistic future, I am proud to announce the summer 2022 launch of Decasonic Labs. At Decasonic Labs, we will be focused on bringing about the vision we have established at Decasonic through rigorous treatment of highly ambitious conceptions of the future. We are hiring for intern and full time positions across software engineering, frontend and backend development, and UX design to partner with the most ambitious builders that want to take the idea of a radically better future as seriously as we do. We will focus on building products that bring blockchain technology to the masses. The infrastructure has been built, but the user experiences and value propositions that drive mainstream adoption have an arduous path to tread. We strive to hold ourselves accountable to our brand as top tier builders and investors, by making tangible contributions to the Web3 ecosystem and pushing forward current boundaries in the user base. Decasonic Labs will be headquartered in Chicago, operating in a hybrid remote/office model such that we can engage in rapid iteration and testing to build the best products possible.\n\nWe strongly believe that embarking on this journey will make us even better investors and drive synergies within our portfolio. It is only by engaging in the arduous trial and failure of incubating companies and building products that one learns the lessons few put in the work to learn. When you’ve built a company you become intimately acquainted with these trials and tribulations, and you can build your own repository of knowledge from these experiences. As a result, we will be able to provide even better advisory to our portfolio companies and empathize with them as they go through the same journey.

Protocols and products that create advocates who bring in others because they are convicted will create an essential flywheel of onboarding with a positive feedback loop.\n\nCommunity and in conjunction growth are now an integral part of the fabric of culture in general and in crypto especially. It creates an infinitely scalable opportunity that encompasses anything from marketing activations to technical breakthroughs on a grassroots level.\n\nThis has been my primary focus and a nascent point of excitement since I entered crypto in 2020 and I aim to have the privilege of working on it as long as I can.\n\n![(ignore the above meme - I actually do stuff outside of making memes) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vrOr0vJUWjjDe8V_H4p00.png?height=499&width=517)\n\n**So, what does my role look like?**\n\nAs Head of Community and Growth, I’ll be working directly with portfolio companies to create uniquely personalized journeys for the founders we work with.\n\nI’ll be doing this by examining what the founders want for their community of users, brainstorming what long term growth might look like with each company, and working with other parts of Chapter One (Founder Experience, Talent and Education, Research and Experiments) to create the most holistic experience for Chapter One’s portfolio.\n\nIn addition, I’m excited to dive into developing and curating resources surrounding community, growth, and business development and open-sourcing anything I find for the public good. Long term, I hope to build robust connections within the space to generate content that helps surface best practices for decentralized communities, internal and external, as well as scalable GTM playbooks for companies of all shapes and sizes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MDeBKe1oIdvwb5ZBjog0Z.png?height=500&width=1000)\n\n**What brought me here?**\n\nI’ve always been a big believer in trying and experiencing first before judging. This has brought me on a wild journey where I submerged myself into different fields from the government defense industry, airline industry, spatial work startups, to multi-billion hedge funds — ultimately landing in crypto where I now call home.\n\nI think it would be remiss to not highlight a few formative experiences below.\n\n* **Delta** ✈️ - my first job as a sophomore in college.\n  * From the first day where I could barely figure my way around the spreadsheet maze, to my last month (a year and a half later) where I was responsible for staffing entire airports on my own using scripts and processes I had worked on. Oh yea, also the free flights worldwide, those were nice.\n* **Zeet** 💻 - my first introduction to startups.\n  * This job was an important view into how a good leader can unlock and empower someone to achieve much more than they could ever imagine. Here I was able to self-start, own, and execute high-leverage projects with little oversight and a lot of encouragement. Shoutout to Johnny Dallas (+ frens), where without them I for sure wouldn’t be where I am now.\n* **Branch** ✨ - my first FT(ish) job.\n  * This job gave me the first glimpse into the serendipity that could be possible in the metaverse. Being a Customer Success Manager I was able to see the direct impact my interactions could have in a B2B/B2C context as well as how important education was for a product regardless of how intuitive it might seem, an essential lesson, especially in crypto.\n* **Special mention to D.E. Shaw**🏦 - a look into the trad-fi void.\n  * This gave me an intimate inside look into the vast world of finance that remains abysmally archaic for the everyday person. From learning about how markets were made to the complex technical systems that facilitate the millisecond trades executed on a day-to-day basis. This look behind the curtain gave me the push I needed to finally land me permanently into crypto.\n\nFinding myself glued to everything crypto. It led me down a rabbit hole of learning and finding what I was passionate about (memes, people, and data) which dropped me right into the team @ Rainbow Wallet🌈 . Here I spent my time at Rainbow dreaming of ways to help onboard the next generation of crypto users through an accessible interface as simple but impactful as a crypto wallet.\n\nBut with Rainbow being my *Chapter Zero*, a proverbial foreword to my ongoing and seemingly never-ending adventure in crypto, I’m super thrilled to begin *Chapter One* of my crypto journey with an amazing team, and even more importantly the amazing community of crypto that has brought me to where I am.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n34OYKT8Y6MmXuU9iZLvC.png?height=500&width=666)\n\n**Let’s Connect!**\n\nThe next few months are going to be fast paced, productive, and invigorating which I can’t wait to lean into and bring y’all on the ride as well. I’m always looking for more people to vibe on crazy ideas with and chat about community, growth, biz dev, and anything meme-related in crypto.

No-one before had imagined that a blockchain can be attacked and forced to be halted. \n\n \n Well that’s what happened to the **TERRA** network. Its native token LUNA lost 100% of its value.\n\n![LUNA Market history over past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_a6dKTArZU9hpPtcX9tbV.png?height=382&width=488)\n\n## Stable Coins\n\nThere are two types of currencies in blockchain, one that you want to increase in prices i.e. the native tokens so that you can gain high ROI’s e.g. Ether, BTC etc. Other one is stable-coins, you want these to stay near 1$ i.e. their initial pegging. They are programmed in such a way that they stay low. They are considered the safe channel if you want to go long on your assets. For a better understanding, you can relate them with government securities in terms of traditional trading, they don’t offer high ROI’s but profits are guaranteed even if they are low. There are many such tokens as Tether’s USD, or US Center government’s USDC**.** \n\n## UST-LUNA\n\nLike USDT, USDC, **TERRA** network has its own stable-coin UST. Now unlike other stable-coins, which are backed up by liquidity in form of real money in the banks, UST is an algorithmically stable coin. Do Kwon, founder of the Terra network, designed this token. As per the theory, UST is 1:1 pegged to Terra’s LUNA. It means UST holders can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA by burning the UST and minting LUNA.\n\n## Attack Phase -1\n\nUST doesn’t have any other utility other than Terra’s most popular [Anchor Protocol](https://www.anchorprotocol.com/#). Anchor offers 20% yield for deposits, this is far more than any other protocol. But this deal is only effective to the UST, no other stable-coins, be it USDC, USDT. \n\nAs per April end, 72% of all the UST was locked into Anchor, estimated around 14 billion dollars.\n\nImagine a bank offering 20% interest on your deposits, obviously everyone would go to that bank and earn that pretty money. That’s what happened with Anchor, as the time passed, the number of lenders increased, but the number of borrowers kept decreasing, in this case a proposal was drawn and it was clear that those pretty 20% interest rates were not going to stand. \n\nAfter hearing the news, people started pulling their locked UST out from Anchor. Since there is no other use of UST, people started getting out of the Terra network\n\n[Anchor Docs](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/)\n\n## Attack Phase -2\n\nNow to exit UST, there are two options, one- the inbuilt burn and mint mechanism, where one can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA, Second option is stable-coin exchange, Curve Finance.\n\nCurve provides liquidity pools for stable coins, same existed for UST too, specifically (UST+3crv pool).\n\nWhen people took out their UST they started swapping it into the curve pool. It increased the amount of UST and decreased the amount of other stable-coins, resulting in the destabilization of the pool.  \n\nTo make things worse, at least one individual dumped about $85 Million worth UST tokens, and exchanged them for USDC. This created an imbalance in the pool. Now to tip the scales back, according to the protocols, Anchor starts offering UST at a discounted price. This was the initial step in de-pegging of UST. This eventually resulted in the drowning of LUNA in the market.\n\n![Transaction showing deposit of $85 Million worth UST](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8i8MY1SsFCuLvCtGvj89p.png?height=390&width=600)\n\n## Attack Phase -3\n\nNow every blockchain has a safe guard which steps in at the moment of crisis. Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) was Terra’s shield in this case. It dumped non-UST stable-coins worth approximately $216 Million into the curve pool to regain the balance. This technique did work for sometime but the prices continued to degrade as people continued to get out of Terra. Panic played a crucial role in the plummeting of the Market, traders/investors lost their trust in Terra. \n\nNow to compensate for the loss in the portfolios, people started selling their other assets to absorb the shock. This resulted in the falling of the market altogether.\n\nDo Kwon had already thought about any incident of such kind, some time later after launching UST, he started buying Bitcoin as safe reserves. But those reserves were not enough to compensate for the destruction.\n\nThis kind of attack forced the blockchain to halt, a decision collectively taken by all the nodes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter the whole month of analyzing , it’s safe to say that we still are at a very early stage, there’s a lot to learn, a lot to unravel, a lot to study. One has to take every step very cautiously because it’s real money at stake here. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1654273711, "digest": "Xup_PA8A5ZGz0bA_7TKb8sp8GgSPuJWSQ-qn00aSnWI", "contributor": "0xC6036B8c3F911f936b661a075CFAA4B802b75cc3"}

We believe in building a “multi-chapter story” with the founders we invest in. We strive to become a venture contributor fund — getting our hands dirty helping on multiple fronts such as Founder Experience, Talent and Education, or Product with founders when they need us.\n\nJeff and Mene have assembled a fantastic group of immensely talented individuals who come from diverse backgrounds — bringing with them an arsenal of incredible experiences that can be immediately applied to the day-to-day work that we do regardless of the scenario thrown at us.\n\nI’m so excited to dive into the themes that Chapter One believes in:\n\n* **Multiplayer Money**: crypto being the foundation of unlocking group coordination\n* **Next Billion Owners:** onboarding the next generation of crypto users\n* **Cult Communities:** a focus point for helping unlock radical thinkers to manifest their ideas\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YFoFewVthgf2WPNL5PTXM.png?height=348&width=717)\n\n**WHY Community and Growth?**\n\nFundamentally, there will come a time when yields taper and the world of crypto no longer flouts outrageous APY's or gains to entice newcomers. Those that continue to evangelize crypto and its community will do it, not because of speculative monetary gains, but because of the right onboarding experience.\n\nI believe that communities that border on cults will help onboard, lock-in, and engage the next generation of crypto natives. Protocols and products that create advocates who bring in others because they are convicted will create an essential flywheel of onboarding with a positive feedback loop.\n\nCommunity and in conjunction growth are now an integral part of the fabric of culture in general and in crypto especially. It creates an infinitely scalable opportunity that encompasses anything from marketing activations to technical breakthroughs on a grassroots level.\n\nThis has been my primary focus and a nascent point of excitement since I entered crypto in 2020 and I aim to have the privilege of working on it as long as I can.\n\n![(ignore the above meme - I actually do stuff outside of making memes) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vrOr0vJUWjjDe8V_H4p00.png?height=499&width=517)\n\n**So, what does my role look like?**\n\nAs Head of Community and Growth, I’ll be working directly with portfolio companies to create uniquely personalized journeys for the founders we work with.\n\nI’ll be doing this by examining what the founders want for their community of users, brainstorming what long term growth might look like with each company, and working with other parts of Chapter One (Founder Experience, Talent and Education, Research and Experiments) to create the most holistic experience for Chapter One’s portfolio.\n\nIn addition, I’m excited to dive into developing and curating resources surrounding community, growth, and business development and open-sourcing anything I find for the public good. Long term, I hope to build robust connections within the space to generate content that helps surface best practices for decentralized communities, internal and external, as well as scalable GTM playbooks for companies of all shapes and sizes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MDeBKe1oIdvwb5ZBjog0Z.png?height=500&width=1000)\n\n**What brought me here?**\n\nI’ve always been a big believer in trying and experiencing first before judging. This has brought me on a wild journey where I submerged myself into different fields from the government defense industry, airline industry, spatial work startups, to multi-billion hedge funds — ultimately landing in crypto where I now call home.\n\nI think it would be remiss to not highlight a few formative experiences below.\n\n* **Delta** ✈️ - my first job as a sophomore in college.\n  * From the first day where I could barely figure my way around the spreadsheet maze, to my last month (a year and a half later) where I was responsible for staffing entire airports on my own using scripts and processes I had worked on. Oh yea, also the free flights worldwide, those were nice.\n* **Zeet** 💻 - my first introduction to startups.\n  * This job was an important view into how a good leader can unlock and empower someone to achieve much more than they could ever imagine. Here I was able to self-start, own, and execute high-leverage projects with little oversight and a lot of encouragement. Shoutout to Johnny Dallas (+ frens), where without them I for sure wouldn’t be where I am now.\n* **Branch** ✨ - my first FT(ish) job.\n  * This job gave me the first glimpse into the serendipity that could be possible in the metaverse. Being a Customer Success Manager I was able to see the direct impact my interactions could have in a B2B/B2C context as well as how important education was for a product regardless of how intuitive it might seem, an essential lesson, especially in crypto.\n* **Special mention to D.E. Shaw**🏦 - a look into the trad-fi void.\n  * This gave me an intimate inside look into the vast world of finance that remains abysmally archaic for the everyday person. From learning about how markets were made to the complex technical systems that facilitate the millisecond trades executed on a day-to-day basis. This look behind the curtain gave me the push I needed to finally land me permanently into crypto.\n\nFinding myself glued to everything crypto. It led me down a rabbit hole of learning and finding what I was passionate about (memes, people, and data) which dropped me right into the team @ Rainbow Wallet🌈 . Here I spent my time at Rainbow dreaming of ways to help onboard the next generation of crypto users through an accessible interface as simple but impactful as a crypto wallet.\n\nBut with Rainbow being my *Chapter Zero*, a proverbial foreword to my ongoing and seemingly never-ending adventure in crypto, I’m super thrilled to begin *Chapter One* of my crypto journey with an amazing team, and even more importantly the amazing community of crypto that has brought me to where I am.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n34OYKT8Y6MmXuU9iZLvC.png?height=500&width=666)\n\n**Let’s Connect!**\n\nThe next few months are going to be fast paced, productive, and invigorating which I can’t wait to lean into and bring y’all on the ride as well. I’m always looking for more people to vibe on crazy ideas with and chat about community, growth, biz dev, and anything meme-related in crypto.

Since there is no other use of UST, people started getting out of the Terra network\n\n[Anchor Docs](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/)\n\n## Attack Phase -2\n\nNow to exit UST, there are two options, one- the inbuilt burn and mint mechanism, where one can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA, Second option is stable-coin exchange, Curve Finance.\n\nCurve provides liquidity pools for stable coins, same existed for UST too, specifically (UST+3crv pool).\n\nWhen people took out their UST they started swapping it into the curve pool. It increased the amount of UST and decreased the amount of other stable-coins, resulting in the destabilization of the pool.\n\nTo make things worse, at least one individual dumped about $85 Million worth UST tokens, and exchanged them for USDC. This created an imbalance in the pool. Now to tip the scales back, according to the protocols, Anchor starts offering UST at a discounted price. This was the initial step in de-pegging of UST. This eventually resulted in the drowning of LUNA in the market.\n\n![Transaction showing deposit of $85 Million worth UST](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8i8MY1SsFCuLvCtGvj89p.png?height=390&width=600)\n\n## Attack Phase -3\n\nEvery blockchain has a safe guard which steps in at the moment of crisis. Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) was Terra’s shield in this case. It dumped non-UST stable-coins worth approximately $216 Million into the curve pool to regain the balance. This technique did work for sometime but the prices continued to degrade as people continued to get out of Terra. Panic played a crucial role in the plummeting of the Market, traders/investors lost their trust in Terra.\n\nNow to compensate for the loss in the portfolios, people started selling their other assets to absorb the shock. This resulted in the falling of the market altogether.\n\nDo Kwon had already thought about any incident of such kind, some time later after launching UST, he started buying Bitcoin as safe reserves. But those reserves were not enough to compensate for the destruction.\n\nThis kind of attack forced the blockchain to halt, a decision collectively taken by all the nodes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter the whole month of analyzing , it’s safe to say that we still are at a very early stage, there’s a lot to learn, a lot to unravel, a lot to study. One has to take every step very cautiously because it’s real money at stake here.", "timestamp": 1654274181, "digest": "Xup_PA8A5ZGz0bA_7TKb8sp8GgSPuJWSQ-qn00aSnWI", "contributor": "0xC6036B8c3F911f936b661a075CFAA4B802b75cc3"}

{"id": "7QErkOlpsRwvWTO6wURvXG1C7_bru974ZU0J7isxXCI", "title": "Forecasting a Music NFT Drop", "body": "## Vérité - “He’s Not You” via Royal\n\n*(scroll down to view forecast)*\n\nIn music’s Web3 future, everyone can be an investor, backing their favorite artists and projects. This shift towards an open and democratized support system between creator and collector has the potential to change the economic structure of the music industry and the artist-fan relationship — for the better. Much better, if things unfold properly.\n\nWith each passing day, more artists are coming up with creative ways to offer non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Since June 2020, there have been 1.68M music NFTs sold, generating just under $100M in primary sale revenue (*Water & Music, Jan 2022*). It would take \\~23.7 Billion streams to generate that same revenue for artists.\n\n![Music NFT primary revenue total and number of streams for artists to accrue this revenue (Water & Music, Jan 2022).](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XIpsoNER3OxSx6Dqa5E9V.png?height=347&width=805)\n\n## Royalty-bearing NFTs\n\nOne type of NFT offering with real disruptive power is the royalty-bearing NFT (sometimes referred to as S-NFTs); those in which artists offer a portion of their royalty share to collectors. This mechanism allows collectors to own a fractionalized portion of a song, album, or even catalog, and share in its future success. For artists, this atypical influx of capital can jumpstart their careers, fund their creative projects, build community, and detach them from the traditional, often predatory, economic structure of the music industry.\n\nRoyalty-bearing NFT drops have been met with intense excitement recently as the earliest drops from platforms Royal (Nas and 3LAU) and Opulous (Lil Pump and Soulja Boy) sold out in minutes.\n\nOn Monday, Royal announced their next drop: 39% of the streaming royalties in Vérité’s single “He’s Not You”*.*\n\n![Ownership royalties and benefits by token level for Vérité's 'He's Not You' NFT drop (Royal.io).](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DtfNDTwlcukP3O5RKcLmx.png?height=1510&width=2206&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n## Discoverability\n\nThus far it seems only established artists are being featured in these early S-NFT drops. This makes sense as it’s early days — but in order to empower creators of all sizes with these resources, we need new tools for discovery and understanding value.\n\n***If music’s Web3 future doesn’t solve discoverability, then NFTs will only enrich artists with preexisting name value and community. This isn’t the future we believe in.***\n\nWe are building data-driven ai models that look at audio patterns and incorporate insights from our research on the neuroscience of music enjoyment$^1$ to find songs that push boundaries optimally and are positioned to over-perform expectation if given the right attention. As the space becomes flooded with more S-NFTs in the coming years, we believe this technology will shine a light on the hidden gems and connect them to supportive collectors, so that all sides can fairly share in the rewards.\n\n***It is difficult for collectors and creators to understand the future royalty value of these NFTs***. We have created a platform that fills this need — [dopr](https://www.dopr.com/) — where collectors will be able to value, discover, and track music NFTs.\n\n## Vérité Forecast\n\ndopr provides 5-year forecasts for streaming and royalty earnings (by quarter), cumulative stats, and a recoupment calculator which breaks down the number of streams and length of time needed for a token-holder to break even.\n\nTo view the full forecast and get early access to dopr click [here](https://www.dopr.com).\n\n![Five-years streams and earnings forecast for Vérité's drop.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mJyUrri_XUrp3NSdJ-wFg.png?height=1634&width=2270)\n\n### In the five year period dopr predicted:\n\n* On-Demand Streams: **2.5M**\n* Total Earnings: **$10.2k**\n* Gold Token Earnings: **$5**\n* Platinum Token Earnings: **$23**\n* Diamond Token Earnings: **$88**\n\nThe drop offers Gold, Platinum, and Diamond tokens, which all have different costs, royalty shares, and additional benefits. dopr shows the expected royalty earnings for each token over a five-year period. dopr estimates that the tokens wouldn’t be recouped through royalties for more than 200 years (Gold), 125 years (Platinum), and 80 years (Diamond).\n\n![The recoupment calculator estimates the time and streams needed for token owners to breakeven, along with other details for each offering.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Qzwe4EmycvNzPUdZdjSOa.png?height=426&width=2270)\n\nThe recoupment calculator displays the costs associated with each token, cost per 1%, royalty share, and streams and time needed to breakeven. On its face, the tokens’ pricing and expected revenue to be generated for ‘he’s not you’ don’t seem to align.\n\nHowever, much of the craze resonating among music S-NFT collectors isn’t focused on the royalty payouts. For a portion of collectors, their value is realized through fandom, social badging, scarcity, and even private experiences, such as the 1:1 video chat Vérité is offering the five Diamond token owners. Each token level has additional benefits beyond the % royalties owned:\n\n* **Gold**: Signed Cassette Tape, Exclusive Access to Vérité NFT Collector Discord channel\n* **Platinum**: Exclusive \"He's Not You\" Vérité Discord access, Plus all Gold Extras\n* **Diamond**: 1:1 Video Call with Vérité, Plus all Gold and Platinum Extras\n\nFor her biggest fans, the chance to have a 1:1 video chat may be priceless. This is in addition to the value these tokens may maintain on the secondary market (attached to royalty value), or in the intangible value of supporting, community, and collectorship.\n\nUltimately, supporting artists and the platforms aiming to empower them in this space has much value in its own right.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nWe envision a future where the 50M worldwide music creators are funded directly from supportive collectors, with all sharing in the rewards. Help us make this a reality.\n\nGet early access [here](https://www.dopr.com).\n\n[www.dopr.com](https://www.dopr.com)\n\n[www.twitter.com/dopr_ai](https://www.twitter.com/dopr_ai)", "timestamp": 1654275370, "digest": "0t6ePJYklo98ua4xceE_92GB0jWJYOSK5ujBi-SJ00k", "contributor": "0x0ac073bAB13cFacd44A5Dc7b063035E43A223014"}

Rebels是谁？\n\n> 通过融合艺术和技术，改变我们的数字身份。\n\n项目本身是一个3D PFP，总发行量为13370个。**Sudo** ?个， ***Leet*高级白**1337个，**白名单**7331个。剩余数量会作为公售全部释出。Rebels的愿景是将叛军作为NFT项目之间的桥梁成为个人身份标志（DID）。项目的灵感来自于很多不同的方向：巴黎的时尚、Apex的游戏画风、以及世界各地的反抗者们。\n\n团队在2021年12月开始了Rebels的孵化，起初创始人发现了一个NFT的普遍问题：单一的NFT局限了用户的展示性，用户无法通过头像去展示自己持有的NFTs，通常需要通过横幅聚合器才可以做到展示持有的NFTs。因此我们需要一个方法去更好的展示我们的NFTs。Rebels便应运而生。\n\n项目最大的亮点在于其主打的可定制化NFT和可编程性，NFT定制化让一张Rebels的NFT作为底图，搭配其独有的徽章系统，使得其他项目的 NFT 可以当作衣服上的徽章所展示。这样，仅凭一张 NFT 就可以进入各大NFT项目， 然后展现自己持有或做出贡献的项目。Rebels持有者将会被赋予该NFTs的**商业权限**。这个商业权包含了之后的版权和商业使用。例如：潮牌服装，Sub DAO, 周边，二次创作盈利等。\n\nMint信息， mint价格和数量都是基于a16z已有的数据进行分析之后得出的。从AMA的回答来看，Nass至少参考了市面上上百个项目。除此之外，Nass许多决策也效仿了a16z之前的[文章](https://a16z.com/2022/03/31/nft-mint-data-early-decisions/)：“The NFT Mint ‘Sweet Spot’: Data on Early Decisions”中提及的一些建议。例如以较低的mint价格，帮助用户提高回报率。\n\n* **Mint**时间：**6月12号**\n* **Sudo**   可以mint**三**个：**free + free + 0.08e + Gas**\n* **Leet**    可以mint**二**个：**free + 0.08e + Gas**\n* **白名单**

创始人，在设计、零售和区块链方面的经验使她成为项目的完美顾问。在NFT领域为Rebels的大局做出了贡献，并与创始人一起制定未来计划。\n\n## 路线图\n\n关于路线图，Nass本人曾多次强调不喜欢过多的描述未来会做的，而是着重于做什么说什么。因此项目的进程基本只能透过AMA得知。\n\n**首次AMA** - 02月12号 - 主题为项目方doxxed，项目起因，和生态构建的愿景。本次AMA，Nass首次提出了定制化概念，但却并未透露太多信息。\n\n**第二次AMA** - 03月20号 - 高级白1337（LEET）公布，mint数量和大致时间公布。更具体的讲解了定制化NFT的概念，以及社区的运营方针。\n\n**第三次AMA** - 04月13号 - 本次AMA回答了社区内部的一些疑惑，重点讲解了定制化NFT的核心和技术概述，以及生态的可能性。\n\n**第四次中文区flash AMA** - 04月27号 - 徽章系统和合约使用问题\n\n**第五次中文space AMA** - 5月7号 - 新技术亮点透露，冷钱包技术。中文区运营方针，合约安全和sub DAO支持\n\n**第六次AMA -** 5月28号 - 主要公布了mint的时间与计划\n\n## 定制化NFT\n\nRebels与其他项目有着很多区别，这也是为什么我会长久的在这个社区里进行知识分享。其中最独特的莫过于其独创的定制化系统。Rebels NFT将会作为一个基点，通过patch徽章系统，允许用户佩戴不同的徽章去展示其持有的NFT。例如一个用户持有BAYC，那么这个用户可以通过定制化系统，把持有的BAYC佩戴到Rebels NFT上。由此一来，用户便能透过一个NFT去打通多个社区。我们将其称之为桥梁——NFT桥梁。\n\n**定制化流程**\n\n* Patch系统是目前最主要的定制化选项\n* 正在评估定制化在技术上的可行性（feasibility），将会有更深入的定制化选项\n* 背景颜色的定制可能性，项目方正在讨论当中，可能在未来开放\n* 项目方将会在未来开放越来越多的定制化选项\n* 定制化流程\n  * 官方网站互动界面\n  * 选择开放的定制化选项\n  * 选择在何处放置patch\n  * 交互上链\n  * 尽可能流畅的用户体验\n\n### Patch\n\n徽章系统，顾名思义，每个徽章都是一个NFT，将徽章佩戴需要借助官网交互。从目前的信息来看徽章NFT可以分为三种：\n\n* 钱包内的NFT\n\n\n* 首批NFT认证将会聚焦于认证的蓝筹，例如Yuga Labs的项目，MoonBirds，Invisible Friends, Doodles。帮助项目宣传\n* 之后会基于Opensea认证来增加这个名单。\n\n\n* 官方提供的一次性徽章，主要为纪念作用\n  * 例如高级白 1337的成员会有独有的LEET徽章去证明1337对社区的贡献。\n  * 但转售时这类徽章将被销毁，同时，一旦佩戴**疑似**不可逆\n* 官方提供的持久徽章\n\n\n* 初期会和设计师，和艺术家合作\n* 之后可能开放**二创**\n\n**转售**\n\n* 当转卖叛军NFT时，patch的变动分两种情况\n\n\n* 如果绑定了官方提供的patch，则patch跟随NFT一起售卖\n* 如果绑定了钱包里的其他NFT，交易成功后这一patch会消失\n\n**冷钱包创新：**\n\n当Rebels的NFTs储存在冷钱包，用户仍可以在官网上进行定制化更改，给NFT上Patch。通过这个创新机制，用户可以最大限度的保证NFTs安全。\n\n**合约**\n\n从目前的信息来看，721A并非最优选择。721A的创新在于打包Mint，但是在面对转移时仍旧面临高额的Gas费用。从已收到的消息来看，可能会基于721x去重新构建一套体系。除了基础的mint合约，定制化交互合约也是团队的重心之一。团队目前讨论了许多方法，并试图提取各个方法的优点，从而创建独有的合约标准。\n\n**安全措施**\n\n* Discord安全性，discord安全管理是业内非常专业著名工程师，经常是第一个对业内事件做出反应。nass等创始人也没有discord完全权限。\n* 合约编写方面是业界有十几年经验的软件工程师，还请到了加密领域合约审计最优秀的人来审计。兼顾内部和外部审核，以及压力测试。\n* 在Mint之前，合约将会在GitHub**完全公开**，届时会开启**bug bounty**\n\n## 项目分析\n\n### 社群运营\n\n以Discord和Twitter为主，因为a16z的运营策略，人均加密KOL。这个对项目本身也是利好。在第二次space AMA中，我们发现了7名a16z加密组成员，虽然a16z无法官宣支持，据Nass透露，项目有受到a16z成员的帮助和支持。Nass自己经常会发twitter去阐述他的理想和想法，这使得社区的凝聚力变得更强。\n\n目前Discord人数为73.7K人，活跃用户在5k\\~6k左右。\n\n目前Twitter关注人数为86K人，平均点赞为1.4k\\~2k，4月22号的图片释出达到高峰7.2K。\n\nWL主要聚焦成员的活跃，虽然无固定规则，但是审核机制十分严谨。具有两层审核。有别于其他项目Rebels的Mod，并无发放权力只有提名权力。每个Mod都有着丰富的项目经历，借助这些经历才能更好的辨别机器人和工作室，试图最大限度的把白名单给到真正为社区做贡献的成员。同时成员之间也有提名权，当一个成员正真深得人心的时候，成员便会自发的去提名。另外，从高级白的发放也可以看到，社区对早期成员的贡献的认可。目前白名单人数为3.58k，高级白人数为527，SUDO人数为4人。\n\n###

外部合作\n\n对于外部合作，Nass更希望与社区内部建立长期的合作，建立社区之间的桥梁，以我们的艺术与技术为重点。我们会与自己（Rebels）社区NFT或画家进行合作。比如x0r，3lau。同时Nass觉得和其他项目合作进行~~交换~~WL交换的意义并不是很大，项目之间共享社区成员，会导致成员在社区的参与感或贡献度降低。WL合作越多，越容易拉进来墙头草。其实抽奖发白，WL合作所面向的仍然是同一批用户。\n\n## 个人分析\n\nRebels应该说是我接触到的第一个项目，也因为此项目认识到了很多人，接触到了web3的内核，去寻找自己在这个行业的理由。我为什么想要写这篇研报？~~，~~我为什么热爱这个项目？~~，~~我为什么能拿到Sudo？~~。~~下面我从我~~自己~~的亲身经验和体验进行了个人想法的阐述~~探讨~~，所有信息都是由这几个月的亲身经历~~体验，~~总结下来的。最后还是想说，我仅代表我本人的看法~~的看法只是我的看法~~，DYOR才是这个圈子最重要的。\n\n### 反抗\n\n我们在文章初期提及了这个项目的原意是反抗，那么我们究竟为何反抗，反抗什么？目前我们正在经历熊市，希望能度过这个难关。熊市学习，牛市fomo。但是牛市的fomo真的是好事吗。纵观过往的这几个月，看到了很多也体验了很多。目前的市场仿佛被fomo的情绪带动，宛如围城，墙外的人想进来，墙内的人麻木不仁。各种项目方都在许~~承~~诺项目可以给持有者带来多大的利益而却忽视了NFT的艺术~~用心制作NFT~~和创新。甚至不少项目方匿名卷钱跑路，这对NFT是一个好的发展吗？或者说如果持续下去，NFT的市场还有什么意义和炒作的价值吗。如果NFT不寻求突破性的发展，而是保持发图卷钱跑路三连操作甚至会受到各国政府的监管打压。\n\nRebels创始人nass在推特上不止一次的对这类项目的各种情况做出了批判。\n\n[https://twitter.com/nassyweazy/status/1524404256836661248?s=20&t=_oOx2HxOuQGsZwkyjV5EFg](https://twitter.com/nassyweazy/status/1524404256836661248?s=20&t=_oOx2HxOuQGsZwkyjV5EFg)\n\nNass认为NFT就应该保持区块链去中心化的精神，以保持更好的公平性。\n\n[https://twitter.com/nassyweazy/status/1480675700264759297](https://twitter.com/nassyweazy/status/1480675700264759297)\n\n### 背景\n\n从6次的AMA中发现，Nass是个十分有认知的项目发起人，合理利用a16z的资源去帮助他成功是这个项目最终能成功的一大助力。另一个我十分欣赏的地方在于，Nass有参考之前的项目，解析项目代码去改进。Nass：“我们分析了BAYC的合约，发现他们并没有优化transfer函数，我们通过分析他们的项目从而改善我们的合约”。目前很多NFT项目都发生了严重的合约问题，尽管很多问题都已有解决方案，可是很多项目依旧照犯了。 对比Nass和其他项目创始人，我们可以看到，强大的背景带来的不只是技术，还有对历史的尊重。**借鉴历史**，**从历史学习。**\n\n### 共识\n\n在加密领域之中共识的地位举足轻重，一个项目的价值取决于其是否有着良好的共识机制，共识又取决于价值，而目前大多数NFT项目的共识仅来自于地板价。但是，价值并不仅仅局限于资金价值，信息知识和人脉这些间接但是持久的价值也是不可忽略的，Rebels里面的成员通过知识共享建立了一个类似技术论坛的社区空间，每周二会举办分享会，亦或是每天早上/晚上的复盘。这些聊天内容实际上给Rebels成员提供了特别的价值。Rebels的中文社区尝试帮助新加入的NFT新人实现从0到1的转变。\n\n### 激励\n\n在NFT中，很多人买一个NFT图片当做头像。不只是为了好看喜欢，更多的是想对别人展现你NFT的价值。NFTs是一个集美学、赞助、地位、收藏和社交的混合资产。就拿BAYC持有者来说，通常此类持有者同时也会是其他的蓝筹持有者。但是目前的PFP功能受限于单个NFTs的展出。当然有多个NFT展示的方法，例如半分法的融合，但是此类NFT便无法通过NFT审核和认证。Rebels此时便可以成为这个桥梁去链接不同的NFT社区，让用户可以展示自己的持有或是热爱的图。\n\n我认为财务价值的主要形式有两种。\n\n* 第一个是团队可以控制的，是创建人们想要使用的产品。第二种方式是社区为人们创造参与的理由\n* 第二个则是运动。人们参加运动是因为他们喜欢这项运动。体育运动的副产品可以是健康和社会效益。人们可能会加入后者，但这项运动是核心。\n\n![这个是Ohhshiny特制的Rebels NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UHPr4gpVLNJQKfFxXji5W.png?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n### 玩法分析\n\n定制化的玩法是很有趣的想法，透过定制化用户不在受制于单个头像，以~~一个~~头像加徽章的方式可以向其他人展现持有者参与的其他项目或是持有的其他NFT。徽章也有很多很多可能性：~~，~~NFT on NFT 直接的提供了二创以及衍生的可能性；~~，~~一个艺术家未来可能不一定需要在Opensea发布NFT转而制作徽章系列，类似社交媒体的表情包系列；~~。~~亦或是~~或者~~透过某个徽章，成员可以去自发的组建subDAO。\n\n在最近的思考和交流中，社区内成员提出成就概念。如今有很多项目会发放POAP，POAP的核心概念很像传统游戏中的成就。那么我们是否可以延展成就系统，一种成就是传统的POAP，另一种成就是基于初始持有者，例如持有时间超过500天，项目方便会发放一个钻石手的成就。因此徽章不会局限于一部分内容，可能性是更多的。\n\n## RebelsLabs\n\n> Rebels Labs是NFT项目Rebels中文社区所提出的subDAO概念。\n\n### 理念\n\n其理念在于最大化利用Rebels独创的徽章系统的潜力，将徽章转换成广告位，从而实现广告产业从web2到web3的转变。当每一个Rebels持有者都佩戴着某个项目的徽章时，我们的原生流量估算在7k左右，通过7k持有者分散传播进而引导社交裂变，从而形成web3独有的病毒式宣传方式。\n\nRebels Labs可提供以下几种营销服务\n\n* Rebels Labs的网站将会展示所有合作伙伴的项目介绍及内部调研，将有一个评分系统，将项目进行评级，从而为项目进行宣传。\n* Rebels Labs的官方Twitter进行Giveaway形式的宣传。\n* 所有Rebels Labs成员将进行转推，转推成功后将获得相对应的代币或者积分进行奖励。\n* 将由NFT领域经验丰富的团队专属定制新兴NFT项目的广告、营销策略、宣发模式等。\n* 可以为发售结束的NFT项目进行实体周边的定制，这是Rebels Labs背靠全球轻工业巨头——中国所拥有的天然优势。\n\nRebels Labs将“球衣广告位”为蓝本，力求在Web3世界中绘制一副更为宏伟的广告蓝图。\n\nRebels Labs也不仅仅局限于广告，也将为NFT项目进行营销咨询的服务，真正做到，让每一位艺术家都可以大胆放肆得去挥毫泼墨，而营销运营我们将为其处理，从而使创作者得到更多的收益。\n\n### 优势\n\nRebels Labs的优势：将成为一辆不断在NFT领域内运行的地铁，每一位NFT旅程中的乘客都可以在这辆地铁上看到不同的广告。我们的优势在于，每一位Rebels Labs的成员的Twitte账号都会有大量的NFT相关的内容，而看到我们广告的人群，也将会是有大部分的NFT玩家，所以我们的广告投放将会极富有针对性，这便是Rebels Labs广告的优势所在。\n\n倘若Rebels成为蓝筹，那么每个独立叛军的胸口将会成为NFT的时代广场。这将是一块尚未开垦的处女地，在Web3世界当中，尚未有一个完整且成功的广告公司，而Rebels Labs将填补这块空缺！\n\n## 最后结语\n\n最后我想感谢 @lunatic, @neken.eth, @唐古特牧羊人，@travy~~臭小子~~，@皮卡星，@冰墩墩，@June，@youyu，@ALAN， @anni。还有所有的社区小伙伴，因为大家努力才能使社区进步。\n\n我还想特别感谢 @[舟舟

It is scarce. 1 of 1. In the case of infringement of your rights as copyright holder, [it can be advantageous to have formally registered the work](https://www.artbusiness.com/register_and_copyright_art_for_artists.html), however the fact remains that digital media is scarce at the point of creation.\n\nThat these critiques often come from corners who mistakenly characterize crypto as a fraudulent fiction is ironic, as the premise that the digital media we enjoy on previous internets is not scarcely owned by anyone is fictitious. No scarcity is being *imposed* on media, existing scarcity is being *surfaced* and experimented with.\n\nThis is the brilliance of the NFT experiment. NFTs represent an elegant proposal to attempt what I would describe as **feasible abundance**. I.e how can we make free media fair for the people creating it?\n\nDecades deep into the internet experiment we had not yet found a way to reconcile our desire to have as many people as possible enjoy media, while also making life financially feasible for the creators of that work. NFTs create games and value exchange around ownership and collection abstracted above access to the content itself, which ought to be available to everyone. As [Jacob.eth articulates](https://cryptomedia.wtf/), the experiment proposes that the more a work is freely available, shared and memed, the more valuable ownership of that work becomes. As such, it is almost impossible to find a piece of NFT art locked behind a token gated wall. In real terms, *meaningful scarcity* would mean withholding that access.\n\nThis premise also explains why many of the most celebrated early NFT auctions from within the Ethereum community were held to retroactively compensate popular memes, from [Nyan Cat](https://foundation.app/@NyanCat/foundation/219) to [Disaster Girl](https://foundation.app/@DisasterGirl/foundation/25046). The values put forward by many corners of the NFT community are that media ought to be freely available, and that free media ought to be valuable. Information is now free *and* expensive. To achieve both states to the satisfaction of all parties at this immature stage is a minor miracle and to be celebrated.\n\nThis accomplishment is made possible through experimentation with previously hidden dynamics, and foregrounding them can be startling to those who were not previously aware of their existence. I call this phenomenon **the shock of the nude**.\n\nMany critics of crypto and NFTs mistakenly suggest that crypto is introducing financialization, inequity or scarcity to our digital lives. This is false. Public blockchains, through making visible latent forces such as financing, unequal returns, or scarce and valuable ownership, are bringing long existing dynamics to the surface to be scrutinized. These forces are not *new*, they are *nude*.\n\nOur previous internet lives are financialized daily on interfaces most of us do not have access to. Web 2 has concentrated wealth and attention to a handful of players at the top (who often most dutifully serve the objectives and accept the universal terms of a handful of platforms), but few other than professional insiders *have seen* the full extent to which this is true.\n\nWhat often emerges on twitter is people with a casual, idealistic, fan-side relationship with media condescending those with a longstanding commitment and understanding of their respective industries. This gulf in knowledge becomes apparent when critics are invited to propose their own alternatives to the current state of the web for creators, with highly RTable but practically infeasible ideas ranging from [laborious illegible key exchanges on a private database](https://blog.mollywhite.net/digital-artists-post-bubble-hopes-for-nfts-dont-need-a-blockchain/) (i.e like a blockchain but way worse) to [vague allusions to revive failed state based internets from 50 years ago](https://reallifemag.com/reconnected/). These ideas sound nice to an equally inexperienced crowd, but are unserious and do not stand to help anyone but their authors. If only things were so easy!\n\nAn unsurprising byproduct of a web modeled to facilitate advertising, it is often quite difficult to discern between solid information and promotional misdirection on Web 2.  There is a significant discrepancy between the statistics the public has access to and the hard financial and industrial realities obscured by them.\n\nIn the arts, the followers and stream numbers we see are a very distorted indicator of how well the person in question is doing financially, and say little of how people actually make a living. Due to tired dynamics of self promotion and brand construction encouraged by web 2 platforms, there is little incentive for anyone to disclose that they are struggling or in a precarious position. Crypto’s public ledgers shatter illusions and hold potential of unveiling sobering truths. **Web 2 is the grift.** **Web 3 is a gift**. It is not morally sound to accept that many people are committing their 20s and 30s to participating in a fiction while silently struggling, adrift of access to good information.\n\nOnly once the warts-and-all truth is made visible do we have any hope of addressing how the world actually works. The shock of the nude may be a cold shower, but a dose of reality is far more useful to practicing artists or internet denizens than a fictitious understanding of  the web and creative industries. Access to more accurate information outside of the promotional mirage of likes and follows is an uncontroversial good for anyone aspiring to make a living.\n\nThat said, while public ledgers make it quite difficult for many to pretend that things are going better than they actually are, there is no shortage of illusion creation on public blockchains too. For a minority who have the means, it is possible to distort perceptions by illicitly pumping bags, making anonymous acquisitions and the like. **Public ledgers are no panacea**, however I find it far preferable that such coordinated distortions be legible and open to scrutiny. As discussed [in our podcast with Context.app](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/making-web3-human-legible-constructive-speculation-and-the-shock-of-the-nude-with-context), more tools are being built to make on-chain activity human legible.\n\nIt will become harder and harder over time to get away with as new forms of journalism are made possible through the ability to track foul play, even retroactively. As [Taylor Monahan recently suggested on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1532085029857284101?s=20&t=UeymocOPtyFVEUOwwmhR8A), so far often the best policing of foul play in crypto has come from within crypto itself, and that accountability will spread as more learn how to read on-chain activity.\n\nYou can follow me [@matdryhurst](http://twitter.com/matdryhurst) on twitter\n\nWe discuss matters like this with wonderful guests weekly [on the Interdependence podcast](https://interdependence.fm/)", "timestamp": 1654274950, "digest": "_sXRcv5Mvc_2__hnfJ4WdNaoxSuqycV-TZKHYFXr1FQ", "contributor": "0xB1F6C97F4D2FEBa6b128F7B6D364E1ED1dca0b99"}

Por eso como inversores es importante identificar proyectos con fuentes de ingresos reales.\n\nEs necesario conocer de donde provienen los ingresos que luego generan los APR.\n\nAlgunos ejemplos de son:\n\n* **Comisiones de trading/swap**\n\nSon tarifas pagadas por quienes intercambian activos en un pool de liquidez (LP)\nEstas tarifas van a quienes proporcionan liquidez (tokens) a estos pooles.\n\nLos LPs obtienen su APR de:\n\n1. Inyección de recompensas (insostenible)\n2. Tarifas comerciales (reales)\n\nCuando el APR proviene de la porción de inyección de recompensas (excesiva emisión de tokens) estas se financian a través de la inflación simbólica y no son sostenibles. No hay ingresos externos que respalden estas recompensas.\n\nLas tarifas comerciales son ingresos reales. Los usuarios pagan una comisión por la utilización de los LPs. Uniswap es un ejemplo de esto, las recompensas no va a los tenedores del token $UNI, todo se distribuye a quienes aportan a los LP.\n\n* **Tarifas de protocolo** \n\nEstas son tarifas pagadas a un protocolo a cambio de brindar un servicio. Por ejemplo los bridges mueven fondos de una cadena a otra y cobran a los usuarios por este servicio.\n\n* **Interés por préstamo** \n\nLos intereses de los prestatarios también son ingresos reales, pero la mayor parte va a los prestamistas.  La ganancia real que el protocolo conserva y comparte con los poseedores de tokens se calcula: Interés de los prestatarios menos el interés pagado a los prestamistas.\n\nHasta acá ingresos reales, con los que se pagan los rendimientos a los inversores. Pero hay protocolos que usan otras estrategias más deficientes para ofrecer mejores ganancias.\n\nVeamos ejemplos de ingresos insostenibles.\n\n* **Yield farming incentivados en LP**\n\nLos yield farming son solo tokens que se imprimen y distribuyen a costa de la inflación. Las recompensas por la emisión de nuevos tokens no son un rendimiento \"real\". Potencialmente, puede ganar dinero de ellos mediante el farming y el dumping a corto plazo, pero no son fuentes de rendimiento reales o sostenibles.

{"id": "wNgr_gu1F5aanrW3cwBwO1hAg2EB7DWLBrB1O0MsVKs", "title": "Studying the Optimism Collective", "body": "![Optimism Collective Announcement](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Hz5mYJLcQfRc9AlMuHB_TA.png)\n\n***Disclosure: You may already be a winner of the*** ***[$OP token sweepstakes](https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/check). I am serving as a delegate for the Optimism Token House.***\n\nThis week Optimism dropped the $OP token, initiating Optimism Governance. Optimism’s governance system presents an exciting opportunity to study the latest thinking in governance design and helps us focus on shaping the next era of Web3 through its focus on public goods. With the launch of the token, Optimism created the Optimism Collective, an ecosystem that will govern the distribution of public goods funding derived from the revenue the protocol generates. The Optimism Collective is governed by three bodies: the Token House (holders of $OP), the Citizens’ House (select NFT holders), and the Foundation. Optimism’s structure is notable for its balance of power between the three governing bodies, the use of multiple voting styles (token-weighted and one-person, one-vote), and the Collective’s commitment to experimentation.\n\n*What is Optimism?*\n\nOptimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is an optimistic rollup: it is optimistic, because it assumes transactions submitted to it by users are valid; it is a rollup, because it sequences transactions off of Ethereum and periodically submits a merkle root of the transactions to Ethereum to create a resulting state change. Given that Optimism’s sequencer does not ensure the same security as Ethereum, Optimism creates a dispute period after its sequencer publishes a batch of transactions, during which a party can challenge a state change with a fault proof (for a reward) which will prevent the state change from being committed to Ethereum. Optimism is the first layer 2 to achieve EVM equivalence, meaning that there is no difference between how smart contracts are executed on L2 and L1, which makes deployment on Optimism easier.\n\n*The Optimism Collective — Mission*\n\nThe Optimism Collective is guided by a vision of “sustainably fund\\[ing\\] those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond.” In essence, Optimism is devoting protocol revenue tokenholders and trusted stewards of the community to fund public goods projects that create compounding value for Optimism and eventually Web3 and broader society. The Collective was created with a view toward making public goods creation profitable, meaning “impact=profit.” The Collective seeks to achieve its mission by funding public goods both proactively and retroactively. Proactive funding encourages innovation and risk-taking in the pursuit of public goods; retroactive funding ensures that impactful projects are rewarded.\n\n*Balance of Powers*\n\nOptimism seeks to balance the short-term and long-term views of the community by balancing power between the Token House, the Citizens’ House, and the Foundation.\n\n![Optimism Governance Overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*V9XR86iMDooYoZBg.jpeg)\n\nThe Token House is entrusted to make determinations about project incentives, protocol upgrades, and the appropriation of treasury funds to the Foundation. By leveraging the collective knowledge of the Token House, the Collective is able to improve the predictive power of its grants and adjust to the specific needs of the Optimism community. The democratic aspect of the Token House ensures that the users of the protocol have representation in determining the future of the protocol’s mission and function.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will focus on retroactive public goods funding. Citizens will be selected from the community; their citizenship is non-transferrable. By selecting individuals who have demonstrated value to the Optimism ecosystem, the Collective will increase the likelihood that retroactive funding represents true value provided to the community. Having a consistency of identity creates continuity in criteria and makes long-term decision-making possible.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is the steward of the Collective. It oversees the administration of governance, allocates treasury assets (including the distribution of $OP), vetoes malicious proposals, and has the power to amend the Constitution. The Foundation has many stabilizing powers for the community, yet its capabilities remain in check by the Token House. The Token House can remove directors from the Foundation and veto changes to the founding documents that would materially impair tokenholders’ rights.\n\n*Mixed Voting*\n\nThe Token House and Citizens’ House have different forms of voting to suit different functions. The Token House votes on a token-weighted basis. As in any token-weighted system, Token House voting is susceptible to plutocratic concentration of power and voter apathy. The Token House permits tokenholders to delegate their votes to stewards who have made public commitments to act as stewards for the Collective. Delegation may mitigate the power of individual holders who have high concentrations of power by enabling smaller holders to pool their votes through a delegate. Delegation also ensures that there are members of the community who are dedicated to participating in governance, mitigating the chance that small groups can collude to pass self-interested proposals with a quorum.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will operate through a one-person, one-vote system. Citizens are ultimately expected to be chosen through deliberation between the Token House and the Citizens’ House. Given that Citizens are chosen based on their specific insights, the one-person, one-vote structure is sensible: newly minted citizens will have equal footing with incumbents for decision-making.\n\nBringing a token-weighted system together with a one-person, one-vote system creates a balance between the short-term and the long-term as well as between the prospective and retroactive. Both Houses come together to determine the Optimism network parameters, which affects the balance between transaction volume on the Optimism network and funding supply for retroactive public goods funding. This balance keeps the present and future health of the protocol fairly represented: tokenholders are not unfairly called upon to subsidize large-scale infrastructural projects, while citizens have a voice in projecting long-term funding needs to improve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n*Experimentation*\n\nOptimism’s Working Constitution is brief, but the first principle is “a commitment to experimentation.” Projects that have a need for a complex beginning also have a need for flexibility. At the point of initiation, the Optimism community can only match an understanding of their needs with governance theory and the knowledge of how other DAOs have succeeded and failed. To ensure the success of the governance process, the community needs to commit to a flexible system in order to test theory with community-specific data. By focusing on experimentation, Optimism will collect important data on what principles and rules best suit the mission of funding public goods and use that data to create a better fit between the Collective’s mission and its procedure.\n\nEarly experimentation mitigates path-dependency. By maintaining a commitment to testing theories, the community encourages honesty about the value of the governance systems it tries. A collective mindset of flexibility also encourages the community to innovate, as the cost of failure is lowered and the value of the data collected is high.

I am serving as a delegate for the Optimism Token House.***\n\nThis week Optimism dropped the $OP token, initiating Optimism Governance. Optimism’s governance system presents an exciting opportunity to study the latest thinking in governance design and helps us focus on shaping the next era of Web3 through its focus on public goods. With the launch of the token, Optimism created the Optimism Collective, an ecosystem that will govern the distribution of public goods funding derived from the revenue the protocol generates. The Optimism Collective is governed by three bodies: the Token House (holders of $OP), the Citizens’ House (select NFT holders), and the Foundation. Optimism’s structure is notable for its balance of power between the three governing bodies, the use of multiple voting styles (token-weighted and one-person, one-vote), and the Collective’s commitment to experimentation.\n\n*What is Optimism?*\n\nOptimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is an optimistic rollup: it is optimistic, because it assumes transactions submitted to it by users are valid; it is a rollup, because it sequences transactions off of Ethereum and periodically submits a merkle root of the transactions to Ethereum to create a resulting state change. Given that Optimism’s sequencer does not ensure the same security as Ethereum, Optimism creates a dispute period after its sequencer publishes a batch of transactions, during which a party can challenge a state change with a fault proof (for a reward) which will prevent the state change from being committed to Ethereum. Optimism is the first layer 2 to achieve EVM equivalence, meaning that there is no difference between how smart contracts are executed on L2 and L1, which makes deployment on Optimism easier.\n\n*The Optimism Collective — Mission*\n\nThe Optimism Collective is guided by a vision of “sustainably fund\\[ing\\] those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond.” In essence, Optimism is devoting protocol revenue tokenholders and trusted stewards of the community to fund public goods projects that create compounding value for Optimism and eventually Web3 and broader society. The Collective was created with a view toward making public goods creation profitable, meaning “impact=profit.” The Collective seeks to achieve its mission by funding public goods both proactively and retroactively. Proactive funding encourages innovation and risk-taking in the pursuit of public goods; retroactive funding ensures that impactful projects are rewarded.\n\n*Balance of Powers*\n\nOptimism seeks to balance the short-term and long-term views of the community by balancing power between the Token House, the Citizens’ House, and the Foundation.\n\n![Optimism Governance Overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*V9XR86iMDooYoZBg.jpeg)\n\nThe Token House is entrusted to make determinations about project incentives, protocol upgrades, and the appropriation of treasury funds to the Foundation. By leveraging the collective knowledge of the Token House, the Collective is able to improve the predictive power of its grants and adjust to the specific needs of the Optimism community. The democratic aspect of the Token House ensures that the users of the protocol have representation in determining the future of the protocol’s mission and function.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will focus on retroactive public goods funding. Citizens will be selected from the community; their citizenship is non-transferrable. By selecting individuals who have demonstrated value to the Optimism ecosystem, the Collective will increase the likelihood that retroactive funding represents true value provided to the community. Having a consistency of identity creates continuity in criteria and makes long-term decision-making possible.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is the steward of the Collective. It oversees the administration of governance, allocates treasury assets (including the distribution of $OP), vetoes malicious proposals, and has the power to amend the Constitution. The Foundation has many stabilizing powers for the community, yet its capabilities remain in check by the Token House. The Token House can remove directors from the Foundation and veto changes to the founding documents that would materially impair tokenholders’ rights.\n\n*Mixed Voting*\n\nThe Token House and Citizens’ House have different forms of voting to suit different functions. The Token House votes on a token-weighted basis. As in any token-weighted system, Token House voting is susceptible to plutocratic concentration of power and voter apathy. The Token House permits tokenholders to delegate their votes to stewards who have made public commitments to act as stewards for the Collective. Delegation may mitigate the power of individual holders who have high concentrations of power by enabling smaller holders to pool their votes through a delegate. Delegation also ensures that there are members of the community who are dedicated to participating in governance, mitigating the chance that small groups can collude to pass self-interested proposals with a quorum.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will operate through a one-person, one-vote system. Citizens are ultimately expected to be chosen through deliberation between the Token House and the Citizens’ House. Given that Citizens are chosen based on their specific insights, the one-person, one-vote structure is sensible: newly minted citizens will have equal footing with incumbents for decision-making.\n\nBringing a token-weighted system together with a one-person, one-vote system creates a balance between the short-term and the long-term as well as between the prospective and retroactive. Both Houses come together to determine the Optimism network parameters, which affects the balance between transaction volume on the Optimism network and funding supply for retroactive public goods funding. This balance keeps the present and future health of the protocol fairly represented: tokenholders are not unfairly called upon to subsidize large-scale infrastructural projects, while citizens have a voice in projecting long-term funding needs to improve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n*Experimentation*\n\nOptimism’s Working Constitution is brief, but the first principle is “a commitment to experimentation.” Projects that have a need for a complex beginning also have a need for flexibility. At the point of initiation, the Optimism community can only match an understanding of their needs with governance theory and the knowledge of how other DAOs have succeeded and failed. To ensure the success of the governance process, the community needs to commit to a flexible system in order to test theory with community-specific data. By focusing on experimentation, Optimism will collect important data on what principles and rules best suit the mission of funding public goods and use that data to create a better fit between the Collective’s mission and its procedure.\n\nEarly experimentation mitigates path-dependency. By maintaining a commitment to testing theories, the community encourages honesty about the value of the governance systems it tries. A collective mindset of flexibility also encourages the community to innovate, as the cost of failure is lowered and the value of the data collected is high. If early rules are rigid, systems may proceed despite inefficiencies and flaws in the early design, and the longer the flaws linger, the more difficult it becomes to remedy them in the future.\n\nThe results of the Collective’s experiments will be public goods in themselves.

Of nothingness. Of worthlessness. Of watching my love reject me again with a smile and a dance.\n\nIt’s not just a rejection of *oh we’re just not good together.* It’s deeper. Rejection to the core.

{"id": "CjGLCh_MDJbqrPWab5LXaiUtzmFPsRlV23nuyKhLjzI", "title": "Tokenomics | Part 1", "body": "## What are Tokenomics? \n\nTokenomics can be described as the economics of how cryptocurrencies work, just like banks & governments have monetary policy to control fiat currencies (currencies issued by governments that aren’t backed by any commodity such as gold or silver), crypto has tokenomics which anyone is able to view in order to guess if the token has any chance to succeed.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1nhb_lZdwXid_F1liYxsm.jpeg?height=2111&width=1813)\n\n## Why \n\nWhy is it important to know about tokenomics… Well, most of the time it’s a good idea to know you want to understand where your hard-earned money is going, how it will be used and how the processes operate, just like if you order food at a restaurant you like to see the menu and what goes into the meal.\n\nUnless you’re a full degen and choose to ape in or YOLO all your money into the next hyped shit coin, pump & dump, blatant ponzi schemes or pensions funds managed by someone who care more about their fees than your portfolio. 👀\n\nThis is why you might hear people say things like “So what’s the tokenomics, the supply, market cap, ect.“ when talking about new tokens or/and projects and that makes sense, you should know what ~~you’re throwing your money at~~ investing in.\n\nIMO some good basic questions to ask are:\n\n* How many coins exist?\n* How many coins will be added (how & when)?\n* Is the supply inflationary (increasing) or deflationary (decreasing)?\n* wHaT iS tHe uTiLiTy, which is a very sensible an fair question, for example, can they be used for more than just trading or can they be staked, ect.?\n* Is there a real-world use case?\n* Who are the whales (who owns the majority of tokens)?\n* Is the distribution spread out or concentrated?\n\nThis is just them asking how it works, so they can figure out if it’s a project that they see as valuable for the short term or/and long term - There’s quite a bit to unwrap so I’ll try to explain it as best as I can.\n\n## With those questions in mind, I’ll focus on x6 areas:\n\n* Supply\n* Demand\n* Distribution & Allocation\n* Market Cap\n* Deflationary vs. Inflationary\n* ROI (Return on interest)\n* Roadmap\n* Where are the builders\n\n## Supply\n\nThis just means that how many tokens there are in total.\n\n* Circulating: How many tokens are currently available or/and in use. A slow & steady increase of the circulating supply can be positive, meaning there is active mining hence activity in the project, so you could expect the token value to increase. However if too many tokens are released quickly or/and too often, then that could effect the price negatively.\n* Total: Circulating tokens minus burned tokens (tokens that are permanently removed from circulation by being sent to a wallet address that can’t be accessed, so those tokens are lost).\n* Maximum: The total number of tokens that can ever be produced, some tokens have a max supply such as BTC whereas others don’t have a max supply like ETH.\n\n## Demand\n\nThis means how many people want the token.\n\n* Simple supply & demand, if there is a high demand for the token but a small supply then it’s logical to assume the price would rise. Vice versa, if there is too much supply and not enough demand then the price may fall.\n\n## Distribution & Allocation\n\nHow the token is shared and the spread out amongst the holders. It’s important to make sure that the tokens distributed fairly and that the holders don’t have a large percentage or it could be a sign of whales who could easily manipulate the market and cause pump & dump scenarios.\n\n* Pre-mined: A select group are granted tokens before they’re offered to the public on public sale, these groups can be the developers, team, private investors & VC’s.\n* Fair launch: Everyone has access to the tokens at the same time/price.\n\n## Market Cap\n\nCan be used to indicated token value, popularity & size of the token.\n\n* Current price x circulating supply = Market cap\n* High market cap but low circulating supply has potential to increase over time.\n\n## Deflationary vs. Inflationary\n\nThis means is the token gaining or loosing value. Can be used to indicated token value, popularity & size of the token.\n\n* Deflationary: Has a maximum supply, for example with BTC there is a max limit of 21 million BTC that can be mined & brought into circulation.\n* Inflationary: No maximum supply, such as Dogecoin.\n\n## ROI (Return on interest)\n\nHow much cashflow or income a token can create\n\n* This can be done in different ways, which includes staking, liquidity pools, being a validator for the network, etc.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThis is a plan for the project, it can come as a pitchdeck or whitepaper, ect.\n\n* Addressing current challenges and anticipating future challenges, do they already have solutions and/or are they currently working on solutions?\n\n## Where are the builders\n\nBasically, is the project growing, plateauing or shrinking.\n\n* Does the project or ecosystem have a lot of activity from people working in the space to build, develop and/or grow. If there are, you can assume that’s a positive sign for the project to improve *(& hopefully the price to follow)*.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wcOjh9wYcKJZUUkT8RIii.png?height=1450&width=1446)\n\nI hope that made sense and was clear, or at least gave you a slightly better idea of what tokenomics are, hopefully, you can use your newfound knowledge to research & avoid YOLO’ing all of your savings into the next x1000 token that you found on reddit …\n\nNext, we’ll check out & compare the tokenomics of BTC & ETH.", "timestamp": 1654276581, "digest": "dg3o4792yl-KVtHuUIiTbPmsGfoN4JJz967oHXyI5k4", "contributor": "0xd40C1F4242D17023Fa4894812Ee7563124b27C66"}

{"id": "ZnzuFm1dy84Ua4DjqhDtxPKexwQUUgnOsmCDgHaI2C8", "title": "The Efficacy of YouTube in Autodidactic 10th Grade ELA Instruction\n", "body": "The purpose of this study was to examine students' attitudes and abilities to teach themselves academic content using YouTube in a 10th Grade English Language Arts classroom. It was conducted over a course of four-weeks and analyzed quantitative data in the form of a survey and test scores to test the efficacy of YouTube in a formal learning environment. The demographic makeup of this study consisted of twenty-seven participants from a highly-diverse and urban Title 1 school. \n\nThis study found that students’ attitudes towards YouTube may not determine their ability to use it for learning successfully in the classroom and that YouTube could be equally as effective as teacher lecture in delivering standards-based instruction. For this reason, the lecture-test model in education should be heavily scrutinized as it does not utilize 21st Century technology to its full advantage. Educators should focus their classroom on media literacy (finding credible sources online, utilizing new technologies, and teaching oneself using the Internet) as students will need to be lifelong learners to remain competitive in the future economy. It is recommended that future research test the efficacy of emerging technologies in the classroom.** \n **\n\n**Chapter 1**\n\nStatement of the Problem\n\nThe advent of YouTube was revolutionary for mankind and its popularization could potentially change the face of education, forever, “students can potentially download and stream media wherever and whenever they like, affording great flexibility in learning experiences, and potentially de-tether learning from the bricks and mortar university classroom” (Thomson, Bridgestock, Willems, 2014).  Colleges have increasingly embraced online/distance learning and reaped the financial and logistical benefits of its approach. What effects of this paradigm shift will trickle down to high school ELA instruction? This must be examined, as it is imperative that secondary school curriculum  promote media literacy in preparation for further education (McLoughlin & Lee, 2010). Retention and persistence in online courses is an issue in higher education because students must self-motivate and self-educate (Douglas, 2010). For this reason, using online sources, such as YouTube, to teach oneself has become an essential skill in collegiate online learning and should be taught early in a student’s career.\n\nThe future economy will be highly automated and technologically driven; it is estimated that sixty-five percent of present K-12 students will work jobs that do not exist yet (“The Future of Jobs”, 2016, p. 3).  In order to stay competitive in an automated and globalized economy, it will be necessary for students to teach themselves new concepts and adapt to new environments as they become obsolete . Educators should redirect their curriculum to reflect this reality by preparing students for lifelong learning outside of academia through integrating technology into the classroom (McLoughlin & Lee, 2010, p. 38).  YouTube is a possible means to meet such cyclical demands as it is low-cost, exhaustive, and easy-to-use.  \n\n Educators should integrate emerging technologies which prove more cost-effective, relevant, and efficient than traditional methods into their instruction with the intention of decreasing cost of services and increasing student engagement. Although not in the interest of career educators or educational institutions, this should be a goal of a democratic and equitable society-- where all people, regardless of income, are able to receive a high-quality education for little to no cost. \n\n**Purpose of the Study**\n\nAuto-didacticism through YouTube is happening all across the world, but its efficacy has only been briefly studied. It is possible that people could become well-versed in a subject using YouTube alone, completely outside of an educational institution. \n\nNew technologies are transforming the way people learn. Online learning has become very popular in higher education and is slowly finding its way into high school curriculums. In online learning situations, YouTube videos are often utilized to supplement or replace teacher lecture. Teachers use it because it is accessible, free, current, and if the source is credible, reliable, and students love the platform because it gives them autonomy, diverse perspectives, and the ability to engage on their own schedule.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine students' attitudes and ability to teach themselves difficult concepts through YouTube, and test the efficacy of their approach. This study will explore how students discover information with this democratic, omnipresent, and easily accessible medium.\n\n**Significance of the Study**\n\nSelf-directed online learning requires little resources: anyone with a device connected to the Internet has the ability to educate themselves. It is possible that someone in a Third World country with access to the Internet could access a high-quality education for practically free. Autodidacticism through YouTube could be used as a means to advance one’s career or self-pursuits after graduation, regardless of socioeconomic status. This is a revolutionary concept. \n\nThe sheer amount of information published on the web is enormous. Gonzalez (2004), as cited in Seimens (2005), explains, “the amount of knowledge in the world has doubled in the past 10 years and is doubling every 18 months.” Human advancements in knowledge, about practically everything, is an overwhelming behemoth (Garrett-Wright, Abell, 2011). It is humanly impossible for educators to teach their students everything, and YouTube is an outlet for both parties to stay informed on emerging information. \n\n**Theoretical/Conceptual Framework**\n\nThis study is built mainly upon Connectivism, which states that access to information is more important than the information itself, and that “real-life learning is messy and complex” (Siemens, 2005, p. 5).  Connectivism builds upon on the idea that the Internet can be utilized to share knowledge and that people learn by building upon their prior knowledge in sometimes non-linear ways. \n\nBandura’s (1977) Social Learning Theory is a theory that states that people learn from observing others and replicating their behaviors. Effective modeling and reproduction by the viewer is a method in which humans learn.  Reproducing what has been modeled is inextricable aspect of the human experience. People can learn by watching others perform tasks on YouTube.\n\nBruner’s (1961) Discovery Learning Theory holds the idea that people learn best by discovering information themselves. When humans are given a problem and asked to solve it, humans rise to the occasion by exploring possibilities, wrestling difficult concepts, and arriving at conclusions. The discovery learning process allows for mistakes and insufficiencies because overcoming obstacles leads to increased motivation, creativity, and learning. Students teaching themselves through YouTube could potentially be more effective than a teacher leading students through a prescribed curriculum. \n\n**Research Questions**\n\nThe following questions were examined in this study: \n\n1\\.) Is there a positive correlation between a student’s confidence level in self-guided online learning and their use of YouTube to master a specific-skill (i.e. grammar usage/mechanics) in 10th grade ELA instruction?\n\n2\\.) How proficient are 10th grade students, on a skill-based assessment, at self-educating via YouTube versus traditional instruction?\n\n**Hypotheses**\n\nIt is hypothesized that students will value flexibility in their learning and feel alienated by the current high school educational system and traditional “sage on a stage” student-teacher relationships (Prensky, 2008). They appreciate the freedom in a “go figure it out” approach and find this learning process relevant to their daily lives. Teaching themselves feels natural because Generation Z teachers themselves with technology outside of school. It is also hypothesized that the majority of  students will be able to teach themselves grammar usage and mechanics with YouTube effectively, regardless of proclaimed confidence level. \n\n**Delimitations**\n\nThis study tested a small sample size, and was reflective of a very specific diverse Title 1 student body. Not all students in this study had cell phones or immediate access to the Internet at home due to cultural or financial limitations. It is plausible that these students do not interact with technology in the same manner that those who do always have access. Students may encounter difficulties and not persevere, because they have been taught how to use technology for academic purposes.\n\nLiterature Search Procedures\n\nUsing Google Trends, this researcher searched for “YouTube how to” to analyze if people were interested in using YouTube to teach themselves. The results yielded a steady increase in interest in teaching oneself via YouTube over the course of around twelve years and, as Figure 1 indicates, an extremely high interest (almost 100%) since 2012.\n\nMark Prensky’s, a leader and visionary in technology in education, research was heavily examined for this study. He coined the terms, “digital natives” and “digital immigrants” (Prensky, 2001, p. 1), which will referenced throughout this study. His work begs educators to adapt to the modern world through the use of technology.\n\nArticles from JStor were found regarding the effects of technology on psychology and the brain.  ProQuest was used to find dissertations, which were very specific and relevant to this topic. A simple Google search for credible, academic writing on this issue proved highly effective as well.\n\n**Definition of Terms**\n\nThe following terms will be used in the present action research study:\n\n*ELA:* English Language Arts\n\n*Autodidacticism:* Self-directed online learning \n\n*Digital Native:* a person who has been connected to the Internet for the entirety of their life  (Prensky, 2001, p. 1).\n\n*Digital Immigrant:* a person who lived in the era before personal computing. This person knows “about” technology, but is not fully immersed in its domain (Prensky, 2001, p. 2). \n\n***Chapter 2*** \n\n**Findings from Literature Review**\n\nYouTube is a major player in the Information Age. It has billions of users (Bloom & Johnston, 2010, p. 113), accounts for hundreds of millions of hours of watch time and billions of views each day, has local versions in 76 different languages, and covers 95% of the world’s population. The average time spent on YouTube is forty minutes, and the average amount of video posted to YouTube per minute is 300 hours (“YouTube Statistics,” 2016). With this daily exponential expansion, it is possible that YouTube could become an essential part of the educational system (Fleck, Beckman, Sterns, & Hussey, 2014, p. 23). \n\n**Live vs. Online Instruction**\n\nFiglio, Rush, & Yin (2010) were the self-proclaimed first group to study the efficacy of online instruction versus live instruction. They found that live instruction showed a modest,  almost negligible, increase in learning on a standardized tests. However, the researchers did find a discrepancy in participants whom were Hispanic, male, and low-achieving. Figlio, Rush, & Yin (2010), concluded that online instruction may prove effective for traditional students; however, “students from different language backgrounds, experience or motivation levels might have different experiences in live versus Internet only settings” (p.13).\n\nIn a later study, Driscoll, Jícha, Hunt, Tichavsky, & Gretchen (2012) studied satisfaction and success in a university level Sociology course in online versus F2F (face-to-face) scenarios.  The professor taught the exact same material online and in a traditional classroom. The researchers found similar results to that of  Figlio, Rush, & Yin (2010) stating that, online education is only effective when designed correctly (Driscoll et. al., 2012, 323).  When it came to satisfaction, they found that students found each learning online or in a classroom was equally satisfactory. Their consensus, congruent with other studies they reviewed, was that there is no difference in the efficacy of online or classroom learning (p.325). \n\n**Persistence and Autodidactic Online Learning**\n\nSuccessful self-directed learning requires two key elements in order to be successful: an instructional method process and the responsibility and personality of the learner (Svedberg, 2010). Persistence and tenacity is an integral part of autodidacticism, especially in online distance learning. The dropout rates are higher in online programs as opposed to traditional classroom programs (Douglas, 2010). \n\nA measurement tool exists for self-directed learning “readiness,” Guglielmino’s (1978) Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale.  In Svedberg’s (2010) study, students were measured with this scale. The vast majority of students were labeled as “persisters” as opposed to “non-persisters.” However, the results of the study found that students labeled “non-persistent” actually scored higher on an assessment, which befuddled the researcher and contradicted popular learning theories outlined in Svedberg’s dissertation (p.44). \n\nDouglas (2010) also studied persistence in self-directed online learning. His study focused on the correlation of students’ persistence amongst perceived barriers of success in online learning for adults. Similarly to Svedberg (2010), Douglas did not find a correlation between perceived barriers in self-directed learning and participants’ decisions to participate in self-directed learning. Adults were motivated to learn in online environments regardless of their personal situations.  In fact, there was an overwhelming amount of interest amongst adults in autodidactic online learning environments; 84 percent of adults surveyed said that they wished to self-educate online (p. 92). \n\n**Technology and the Brain**\n\nGreenfeld (2016) studied how emerging technologies affect digital natives’ brains. Greenfeld found that Millennials process information differently than their predecessors. Since information is readily available at all times through the Internet; rote memorization is becoming increasingly unnecessary. Greenfeld concludes that technology, “reduces our motivation to acquire new knowledge that dwells in our heads” and that, “parents and teachers need strategies to educate a generation that increasingly believes all relevant knowledge resides online” (p. 342).  \n\nFisher, Goddu, & Keil (2015) studied a person’s ability to use the Internet and their confidence level in answering general knowledge questions. Participants were asked simple questions like, “Why are there leap years?” and “Why are there more women than men?”  When given access to a search engine, the researchers found an increase in participants confidence levels when given access to a search engine, even if their searches were insufficient.  The researchers explained a “transactive” memory exchange with the Internet. Since human memory is highly fallible, humans have began to refer to search engines and, the Internet in general, to access knowledge. However, the participants had an inflated sense of what they knew and displayed an overconfidence in answering questions. \n\n**Millennial Attitudes towards YouTube**\n\nFleck, Beckman, Sterns, & Hussey (2014) studied effective ways to use YouTube in a college-level psychology course.  Their study utilized high-interest and entertaining, yet relevant, YouTube videos in order to teach content.  Their selection included videos from popular culture i.e. Pirates of the Caribbean and Big Bang Theory. When surveyed before the experiment, 80 percent of students said that they found they videos helpful in an academic setting.  In a post-experiment survey, 97.3 percent of students felt that the YouTube videos were useful and aided in learning. There was a positive correlation with students’ attitudes towards YouTube after they experienced how YouTube could be used positively in the curriculum. The study concluded that there were two elements in which the students found most helpful: entertainment and correlation to the curriculum. \n\n**Baby Boomers Attitudes towards YouTube**\n\nThomson, Bridgstock, and Willems (2014) studied the generational attitudes between Baby Boomers and Millennials about using video in the classroom. Baby Boomers, who teach Millennials, may see emerging technology as a distraction and detractor from education, while Millennials see it as a viable means of credible information (Garrett-Wright & Abbell, 2011). This generational divide is a source of friction in the classroom. Attitudes towards emerging technologies heavily affects how teachers use video in the classroom and its efficacy. When veteran teachers create videos, they tend to make them in an online lecture format. However, this is not the most effective way to exploit the medium of video (Thomson, Bridgstock, Willems, 2014).  There is a disconnect between how Baby Boomers and Millennials consume technology, and this may lead to conflicting views on the role of technology in the classroom, and consequently, how to use it in an effective way.  The content within the video must be relevant to the course and the student’s interest (Thomson, Bridgstock, Willems, 2014), (Fleck, Beckman, Sterns, & Hussey, 2014, p. 23). When Baby Boomers are unable to meet these needs through video, their skepticism is confirmed. However, this is not a problem with the student, but rather with the teacher because developing quality videos requires a skill set which often times Baby Boomers do not have (Thomson, Bridgstock, Willems, 2014, p.76).\n\n**Conclusions** \n\nAcademics overwhelming agree on one thing: not enough academic research exists on YouTube or video as a viable means of disseminating information in the classroom (Garrett-Wright & Abbell, 2011); (Thomson, Bridgstock, Willems, 2014); (Greenfeld, 2016); (Svedberg, 2010).  Researchers, academics, and educators realize that education is incongruent with future lifestyles and economy (Bloom & Johnston, 2010).  The process of redefining a modern education exemplar requires cross-generational understanding, feedback, and integration (Garrett-Wright & Abbell, 2011).  There is a technological rift that exists between those who grew up with technology in their households (digital natives) and those which learned to adapt (digital immigrants) (Prensky, 2001), and YouTube may be a tool to mend this schism in the classroom. YouTube is easy to use, ubiquitous, and free (Garrett-Wright & Abbell, 2011).  It is possible that entire courses will one day be based entirely around YouTube, which could make the generational divide in teaching irrelevant. \n\n**Implications for Future Research**\n\nEducators must reconcile traditional pedagogy and modern society. Future research should scrutinize the lecture-test model in education and examine the role of the teacher in the classroom as emerging technologies that may be more cost-effective, relevant, and efficient than traditional education are introduced. \n\nThe efficacy of self-directed online learning is difficult to measure in an online setting. Svedberg’s (2010) studied yielded contradictory results than pontificated: there may not be a correlation between self-motivation and self-directed online learning efficacy. A difficulty cited was the hurdle of getting honest and thoughtful feedback from participants, especially those considered “non-persisters”. Svedberg (2010) also believes that “reading avidity, GPA, how a student connects to the Internet, and work obligations should also be considered in future studies.  Douglas (2010) states that his study could have been improved by taking a larger and truly random sample rather than examining a specific population. \n\nResearchers should examine the use of YouTube in everyday life rather than isolated controlled settings. In a controlled setting YouTube may prove to be highly effective. However, in everyday situations, as Greenfeld (2015) postulates, YouTube may prove to be just another distraction.  Researchers should understand that there is a difference of how students interact with technology in a formal experimental setting rather than browsing at home, where there are an infinite amount of distractions. In order to account for this, researchers could possibly let students multitask while they conduct an experiment to simulate a realistic setting. Or, researchers could use an informal setting while conducting an experiment to extrapolate more convincing results. \n\n**Chapter 3**\n\n**Research Design**\n\nThe design of this research was experimental. Both classes were taught the same topic but were delivered content differently. Students were given three pre/post tests over a span of four weeks.The order of the research experiment was as followed:\n\n1. Students were given an attitudes survey regarding their use of YouTube.\n2. A pretest was administered.    \n3.  Instruction lasted around twenty minutes. The control group received instruction by teacher lecture and the experimental group was given a YouTube playlist to view at their leisure. Instruction in the control group was traditional teacher lecture, whereas the experimental group received instruction by watching YouTube videos in playlists curated by the teacher. In the control group, students were lectured with a PowerPoint presentation\n4. A worksheet was given to students for practice. \n5. A posttest was administered. \n\n Only quantitative data was collected for this experiment because qualitative data was not necessarily relevant to the tested outcomes. The independent variable for this experiment was the method of delivery and the dependent variable was student growth by percentage points.\n\n**Sampling**                                                                                                                                      \n\nThe sample was not random; the classes were based upon scheduling by the school’s administration. Both the control and experiment groups were English II Standard classes of comparable ability level. \n\n**Participants**\n\nThis research was conducted at a Title 1 school in Middle Tennessee. The participants of this study consisted of a highly diverse student body, many of whom were bilingual. There were twenty-two students total. Four students spoke Arabic and fourteen spoke Spanish. There were also two black students and two Asian students.  Four students were enrolled in ELL programs, and one student had an IEP.  Nineteen of these students were in 10th grade and three were registered 12th graders. \n\nThe experimental group consisted of seventeen students.  The majority of students were also bilingual. The class consisted of four Arabic speakers, nine Spanish speakers, three black students and one white student.  Eight students were enrolled in an ELL program and one had an IEP.  Thirteen of the students were in 10th grade and four were registered 12th graders. \n\n**Data Collection**\n\nThe research used an experimental approach of collecting data. Quantitative data was measured to answer the following questions: \n\n1\\.) Is there a positive correlation between a student’s confidence level in self-guided online learning and successful use of YouTube to master a specific-skill (i.e. grammar usage/mechanics) in 10th grade ELA instruction?\n\n2\\.) How proficient are 10th grade students at self-educating, on a skill-based assessment, via YouTube?\n\n**Apparatus or Instruments**\n\nStudents in both the control and experimental group were administered pre/post tests with Kahoot at the end of each class session. Kahoot has been used several times in the classroom before and was familiar to the students. Kahoot was used for ease of use and reliability in data collection. Students used their cell phones or school issued computers to complete the tests.\n\nA survey was given on Google Forms using a Likert scale (1-5) to test students attitudes towards self-directed learning and YouTube before the experiment began. The questions consisted of how comfortable students were with YouTube, teaching themselves, and their attitudes towards utilizing YouTube in a classroom setting. \n\n**Data Analysis**\n\nData was collected in order to test the effectiveness of YouTube as an instructional method in the classroom. The researcher collected and analyzed students’ attitudes towards using YouTube and compared their responses with their average scores on posttests.  Posttest data was also used to compare the efficacy of YouTube in autodidactic instruction to traditional lecture in a 10th grade ELA classroom.\n\n**Ethical Behavior**\n\nThis researcher conducted an ethical study. Parents were given letters of consent forms at the beginning of the study, which were signed and returned to the researcher before any research data was collected. This study did not interfere with the curriculum in any way. All personal information from students was anonymized by assigning students’ names to numerical digits.  The data was kept securely by the researcher.  The school district and name of the school did not appear in any presentation or publication of data. This researcher also realizes that limitations in this study do exist, meaning that it may not be generalized to other populations. \n\n**Chapter 4**\n\n**Pre-Instruction Assessment**\n\nAn attitudes survey was given to all 27 students who participated in the study to determine how students interacted with YouTube. This survey quantified student comfortability levels with the medium, usage amount, general attitudes, and their preferred teaching model \n\n(YouTube vs. lecture vs. hybrid). The researcher did not want to make any assumptions about how students used the platform and was interested in getting a general idea of how students used YouTube, and if they felt it could be used in an academic context. \n\nFigure 3 indicates that the majority of students were “very comfortable” and confident in their ability to teach themselves using YouTube. Zero percent of students responded that they were “not comfortable” whereas forty-eight percent were “very comfortable.” Only three students (eleven percent) noted that they were less than comfortable.  \n\nThere is a correlation between students’ comfortability levels and usage. For example, forty-eight percent were daily users and forty-eight percent of students were “very comfortable.” Eleven percent of students reported being less than comfortable and eleven percent of students used it once a week. \n\nFigure 4. Students’ Preferences for Methods of Instruction. \n\n \n\nFigure 4 indicates the majority of students prefered a hybrid teaching method; Fifty-nine percent of students gravitated towards a mixture of lecture and teaching themselves. \n\nFigure 5. Student Attitudes Towards Using YouTube in the Classroom.\n\nFigure 5 shows that the vast majority (eighty-five percent) of students found YouTube to be a useful tool in the classroom. \n\n** \n Post-Instruction Results**\n\nFigure 6. Percentage Increase after Instruction Intervention.\n\nFigure 6 compares the increase in scores between the pretest and the posttest with the Lecture (control) and YouTube (experimental) group for three different lessons (MLA format, comma/semicolon usage, and parallel structure). There was a +13.79% difference in the control group lecture with MLA format. However, there was a -.98% difference in identifying needs for commas or semicolons and -.48% differences in parallel structure. \n\nFigure 7. Correlation Between Average Score and Reported Comfortability Levels. \n\nFigure 7 shows the comfortability rating students indicated on a pre-study survey versus the average score they received on three tests. The average score of students who responded a comfortability level of “2” scored, on average, 70%, “3’ scored 88.3%, “4,” 71.4%, and “5,” 62%. A higher report in comfortability level did not result in a higher score. In fact, those who marked a level of “3” scored better than those, on average, who marked a “5.”\n\n**Chapter 5**\n\n Discussion, Conclusions, and Recommendations\n\n**Summary of the Study**\n\nThis study seeked to test the efficacy of autodidactism in 10th grade in English Language Arts (ELA) instruction and examine students’ attitudes towards using YouTube for learning in the classroom. Twenty-seven students in two different ELA classes participated in a four-week long study. The students took a pre-study survey for the researcher to better understand how students used YouTube in their daily lives and how they felt about using YouTube for learning. Each class took part in three sessions on different aspects of the 10th grade ELA curriculum. \n\nThe three sessions were intensive and required full attention from the students. For the most part, students took the experiment very seriously and answered questions to their best ability. In general, the sessions lasted a little over an hour and consisted of a pre-test, instruction (lecture or YouTube), and a post-test. In the lecture session, students were administered instruction by a slide show presentation and in the YouTube session, students were given a YouTube playlist curated by the researcher. After each session, students were given a worksheet to complete before the posttest. \n\n**Interpretation of Results**\n\nThe results of this study indicate that YouTube may be a viable tool in this classroom. High school students gravitate towards the resource and they use it in their daily lives. Students are comfortable with using YouTube and also feel that it is a useful tool in learning. As this study indicates, autodidacticism with YouTube produced comparable results with teacher lecture in two out of three sessions. In the MLA session, there was a stark increase of 13.79%. A possible explanation for why this occurred is because the questions were mostly qualitative. The questions were not grammatical, they rather asked specific questions about the conventions of MLA format. The researcher may have “taught to the test,” giving the control group an advantage over the experimental group, which was not the intention of the researcher. \n\n**Links to Literature Review**\n\nThomson, Bridgstock & Willems (2014) postulate that the ability to stream content allows students to circumvent the brick and mortar classroom. This reality has massive implications on the future of education and its business model; a school building is unnecessary for learning.  For this reason, McLoughlin & Lee (2010) believe that educators should focus their curriculum on teaching students media literacy: how to find credible sources online, utilize new technologies, and teach themselves using the Internet.\n\nFiglio, Rush, & Yin (2010), concluded that online instruction may prove effective for traditional students, however, students from lower socioeconomic classes may have difficulty using technology for learning. The researcher’s study would need to be compared with similar studies to test the validity of this statement, but this researcher found that their Title 1 students had little difficulty using teaching themselves using YouTube. In congruence with the conclusions of  Driscoll et. al. (2012, p. 323), this researchers also found the efficacy of self-directed learning compared to teacher lecture were similar. In regards to increases in test score, there is no advantage in teacher lecture as a means to disseminate information. \n\nIn line with Douglas (2010) and Svedberg (2010), this researcher found no correlation in students’ perceived confidence and their ability to self-educate. Their attitude towards autodidacticism was, for the most part, irrelevant. In fact, Svedberg’s (2010) study found that students that labeled themselves as “non-persisters” actually scored better on assessments than those who were “persisters”. This study echoed that notion; students who marked “3” on a confidence level measure scored scored much higher those who labeled themselves a  “5.”\n\n**Limitations** \n\nLimitations related to the findings were that the technology used in this study was temperamental. At times, computers froze or locked students out from logging in to the computer. Students may have been frustrated with the technology that was available to them for this reason, resulting in a lower test score. Another limitation related to this study were time restraints. The researcher wanted to perform more sessions with students but was unable to due to block scheduling, other classroom responsibilities, Spring Break, and school closings due to weather.  Continuous sessions may have produced different results as students would be familiar with the format of the experiment and have scored better as a result. \n\n**Conclusions**\n\nAfter analyzing quantitative data, this researcher has concluded that YouTube may be an effective tool in the classroom. In some cases, YouTube is equally, or more, effective than teacher lecture.  The researcher also found that students’ reported comfortability levels with YouTube may not indicate better scores on post-tests. \n\nWhile compiling the playlists used for this study, this researcher found that some YouTube videos explained difficult concepts excellently.  Fleck, Beckman, Sterns & Hussey (2014) discuss the advantages of using videos over teacher lecture in the classroom because videos are not bound by time, location, student or teacher mood, etc. YouTube is a massive library of videos created by experts in their field, and as new content is uploaded regularly, a place for breaking stories in every field. Overall, it is a dynamic tool that has many advantages over teacher lecture and is only getting better and more capable with time. \n\nAll teachers can find useful content on YouTube and few reasons exist to not to use it in the classroom. Educators in every field should consider uploading videos of their own to add content to the already deep breadth of knowledge. A technological future is a reality that must be embraced by educators. Teaching static information in a textbook is losing relevancy, and more dynamic means of disseminating information should be explored and utilized in the classroom to push Education into the 21st Century. \n\n**Recommendations**\n\nThe findings from this study suggest that YouTube is an asset in the classroom. Students may use this website for self-directed learning or as a supplement to classroom instruction. Teachers should teach students how to search for and locate credible sources or create playlists for their students to view. This could allow students to engage with instruction outside of the classroom.\n\n**Implications for Further Research** \n\nYouTube should be further studied in K-12 education to explore its applications in the classroom, in online environments, and in autodidactic learning. It is changing the way people consume information, but is often not recognized formally as a viable resource by academia. This researcher would like to see studies that lasted longer on the subject to further its efficacy.  Studies should be conducted with the consideration of having an online class built entirely around YouTube videos. If this is a reality, it would make the instruction aspect of education at no cost, which is a revolutionary concept. \n\nIn the future, students could theoretically “choose” their teacher. YouTube is a database of knowledge that is exponentially expanding. If a student does not understand their teacher, it could be utilized by students to get a different perspective or explanation, or it could be used in isolation for content delivery. Education should constantly strive to acknowledge tools that are free and readily available for academic and career advancement.\n\n**Action Plan**\n\nThis researcher will use YouTube more frequently in the classroom. Along with lecture, YouTube playlists will be created for students to review concepts, receive further instruction, or as a means to receive instruction in lieu of absenteeism. Videos will also be created by the researcher more frequently to use in the classroom in the place of lecture. Media literacy will be a focus; Students will be taught how to find credible videos and how to use them for academic purposes. The researcher will encourage autonomy by teaching students to use the site to further their academic, career, and personal pursuits. \n\n** \n [References](http://er.dut.ac.za/bitstream/handle/123456789/69/Siemens_2005_Connectivism_A_learning_theory_for_the_digital_age.pdf?sequence=1)**\n\nBandura, A.
