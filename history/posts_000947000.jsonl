{"id": "2GsEhN7mVVKyzU5Cr1shhFAyW1n62oqtNwZbOtlqCms", "title": "Building With Optimism at Decasonic Labs", "body": "**As Bari Weiss put it ever so articulately in *The Case for American Seriousness*: \n * \n “You can’t be an incredible investor if you look at the world with ironic detachment. If you are a naysayer. Or a cynic. Skeptical, yes, of course. But fundamentally you have to believe that individuals with tremendous willpower can do things. Great, shocking, inconceivable things. Like find your husband on your phone. Or build a spaceship to go to another planet. Or create a new currency.”***\n\nThis is an indisputable, capital T, Truth. I have been a venture investor for a very limited amount of time, but if there is anything I’ve learned, it is only and absolutely this. Being an excellent early stage investor definitionally requires taking the future seriously, and as I’ve learned through my life experiences, the future is mostly uncertain, subject to a seemingly infinite amount of variables, and depending on your views, probabilistic. Progress is never clear cut, and as a result finding non-consensus solutions to very large problems can seem like an insurmountable task. Early stage investing requires an incredibly ambitious, yet realistic optimism that is a difficult balance to cultivate.\n\nIn order to develop this mindset, one must acquire a rigorous and analytical way of thinking about things such that you become able to arrive at convincing arguments of a radically more productive, yet probable future. Oftentimes, these views may not be consensus as a result of the subtleties and variance of the paths by which the future can unfold, so one must also develop the nerve to stand on your own two feet.\n\nIf there is a unique mindset that encapsulates the success of Silicon Valley in becoming the mecca of venture capital, it is just this. In the silicon valley of the 2000s, you could find people like John Doerr, Marc Andreessen, and Vinod Khosla who took seemingly absurd conceptions about the future very seriously and labored through the logic of what a highly optimistic and unlikely future might entail in order to reach their own conclusions. Whether it was thinking rigorously in 1996 about a future where one could purchase any product they desire on a single internet website and expect it to arrive at your doorstep within one or two days, envisioning a website that makes the act of complete strangers renting each other their homes entirely mainstream, or conceiving of a future in which most people meet their significant others by swiping on pictures of complete strangers on their smartphones, these investors didn’t just think about the future, they also helped make it come to fruition.\n\nTaking inspiration from the greats in conceiving and building a highly optimistic future, I am proud to announce the summer 2022 launch of Decasonic Labs. At Decasonic Labs, we will be focused on bringing about the vision we have established at Decasonic through rigorous treatment of highly ambitious conceptions of the future. We are hiring for intern and full time positions across software engineering, frontend and backend development, and UX design to partner with the most ambitious builders that want to take the idea of a radically better future as seriously as we do. We will focus on building products that bring blockchain technology to the masses. The infrastructure has been built, but the user experiences and value propositions that drive mainstream adoption have an arduous path to tread. We strive to hold ourselves accountable to our brand as top tier builders and investors, by making tangible contributions to the Web3 ecosystem and pushing forward current boundaries in the user base. Decasonic Labs will be headquartered in Chicago, operating in a hybrid remote/office model such that we can engage in rapid iteration and testing to build the best products possible.\n\nWe strongly believe that embarking on this journey will make us even better investors and drive synergies within our portfolio. It is only by engaging in the arduous trial and failure of incubating companies and building products that one learns the lessons few put in the work to learn. When you’ve built a company you become intimately acquainted with these trials and tribulations, and you can build your own repository of knowledge from these experiences. As a result, we will be able to provide even better advisory to our portfolio companies and empathize with them as they go through the same journey. Furthermore, we are able to build products that create synergies within our portfolio and support our companies through that avenue. Strategically, we see this bear market as an excellent opportunity to act on our conviction by building and preparing for the next bear market with those that know the score will take care of itself.\n\nSo while panic ensues in the broader markets as a result of uncertainty about the macroeconomic future, we build. In the same essay, guest writer, Katherine Boyle states: \n  \n ***“There is no fixed pie when it comes to building. Building is an action, a choice, a decision to create and move. It is shovels in the dirt with a motley crew of doers who get the job done because no one else will. Building is the only certainty. The only thing we can control. When the projects we believed were Teflon strong are fraying like the history they toppled, the only thing to do is to make something new again.”***\n\nWe couldn’t agree more.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1654271765, "digest": "F6K1rd0LB0q4Q7x3vSIgZXYd32ye_2LKWd5qNjforho", "contributor": "0xC962c9262DC388ca0a44000dEae2E45922618366"}

I have been a venture investor for a very limited amount of time, but if there is anything I’ve learned, it is only and absolutely this. Being an excellent early stage investor definitionally requires taking the future seriously, and as I’ve learned through my life experiences, the future is mostly uncertain, subject to a seemingly infinite amount of variables, and depending on your views, probabilistic. Progress is never clear cut, and as a result finding non-consensus solutions to very large problems can seem like an insurmountable task. Early stage investing requires an incredibly ambitious, yet realistic optimism that is a difficult balance to cultivate.\n\nIn order to develop this mindset, one must acquire a rigorous and analytical way of thinking about things such that you become able to arrive at convincing arguments of a radically more productive, yet probable future. Oftentimes, these views may not be consensus as a result of the subtleties and variance of the paths by which the future can unfold, so one must also develop the nerve to stand on your own two feet.\n\nIf there is a unique mindset that encapsulates the success of Silicon Valley in becoming the mecca of venture capital, it is just this. In the silicon valley of the 2000s, you could find people like John Doerr, Marc Andreessen, and Vinod Khosla who took seemingly absurd conceptions about the future very seriously and labored through the logic of what a highly optimistic and unlikely future might entail in order to reach their own conclusions. Whether it was thinking rigorously in 1996 about a future where one could purchase any product they desire on a single internet website and expect it to arrive at your doorstep within one or two days, envisioning a website that makes the act of complete strangers renting each other their homes entirely mainstream, or conceiving of a future in which most people meet their significant others by swiping on pictures of complete strangers on their smartphones, these investors didn’t just think about the future, they also helped make it come to fruition.\n\nTaking inspiration from the greats in conceiving and building a highly optimistic future, I am proud to announce the summer 2022 launch of Decasonic Labs. At Decasonic Labs, we will be focused on bringing about the vision we have established at Decasonic through rigorous treatment of highly ambitious conceptions of the future. We are hiring for intern and full time positions across software engineering, frontend and backend development, and UX design to partner with the most ambitious builders that want to take the idea of a radically better future as seriously as we do. We will focus on building products that bring blockchain technology to the masses. The infrastructure has been built, but the user experiences and value propositions that drive mainstream adoption have an arduous path to tread. We strive to hold ourselves accountable to our brand as top tier builders and investors, by making tangible contributions to the Web3 ecosystem and pushing forward current boundaries in the user base. Decasonic Labs will be headquartered in Chicago, operating in a hybrid remote/office model such that we can engage in rapid iteration and testing to build the best products possible.\n\nWe strongly believe that embarking on this journey will make us even better investors and drive synergies within our portfolio. It is only by engaging in the arduous trial and failure of incubating companies and building products that one learns the lessons few put in the work to learn. When you’ve built a company you become intimately acquainted with these trials and tribulations, and you can build your own repository of knowledge from these experiences. As a result, we will be able to provide even better advisory to our portfolio companies and empathize with them as they go through the same journey.

Protocols and products that create advocates who bring in others because they are convicted will create an essential flywheel of onboarding with a positive feedback loop.\n\nCommunity and in conjunction growth are now an integral part of the fabric of culture in general and in crypto especially. It creates an infinitely scalable opportunity that encompasses anything from marketing activations to technical breakthroughs on a grassroots level.\n\nThis has been my primary focus and a nascent point of excitement since I entered crypto in 2020 and I aim to have the privilege of working on it as long as I can.\n\n![(ignore the above meme - I actually do stuff outside of making memes) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vrOr0vJUWjjDe8V_H4p00.png?height=499&width=517)\n\n**So, what does my role look like?**\n\nAs Head of Community and Growth, I’ll be working directly with portfolio companies to create uniquely personalized journeys for the founders we work with.\n\nI’ll be doing this by examining what the founders want for their community of users, brainstorming what long term growth might look like with each company, and working with other parts of Chapter One (Founder Experience, Talent and Education, Research and Experiments) to create the most holistic experience for Chapter One’s portfolio.\n\nIn addition, I’m excited to dive into developing and curating resources surrounding community, growth, and business development and open-sourcing anything I find for the public good. Long term, I hope to build robust connections within the space to generate content that helps surface best practices for decentralized communities, internal and external, as well as scalable GTM playbooks for companies of all shapes and sizes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MDeBKe1oIdvwb5ZBjog0Z.png?height=500&width=1000)\n\n**What brought me here?**\n\nI’ve always been a big believer in trying and experiencing first before judging. This has brought me on a wild journey where I submerged myself into different fields from the government defense industry, airline industry, spatial work startups, to multi-billion hedge funds — ultimately landing in crypto where I now call home.\n\nI think it would be remiss to not highlight a few formative experiences below.\n\n* **Delta** ✈️ - my first job as a sophomore in college.\n  * From the first day where I could barely figure my way around the spreadsheet maze, to my last month (a year and a half later) where I was responsible for staffing entire airports on my own using scripts and processes I had worked on. Oh yea, also the free flights worldwide, those were nice.\n* **Zeet** 💻 - my first introduction to startups.\n  * This job was an important view into how a good leader can unlock and empower someone to achieve much more than they could ever imagine. Here I was able to self-start, own, and execute high-leverage projects with little oversight and a lot of encouragement. Shoutout to Johnny Dallas (+ frens), where without them I for sure wouldn’t be where I am now.\n* **Branch** ✨ - my first FT(ish) job.\n  * This job gave me the first glimpse into the serendipity that could be possible in the metaverse. Being a Customer Success Manager I was able to see the direct impact my interactions could have in a B2B/B2C context as well as how important education was for a product regardless of how intuitive it might seem, an essential lesson, especially in crypto.\n* **Special mention to D.E. Shaw**🏦 - a look into the trad-fi void.\n  * This gave me an intimate inside look into the vast world of finance that remains abysmally archaic for the everyday person. From learning about how markets were made to the complex technical systems that facilitate the millisecond trades executed on a day-to-day basis. This look behind the curtain gave me the push I needed to finally land me permanently into crypto.\n\nFinding myself glued to everything crypto. It led me down a rabbit hole of learning and finding what I was passionate about (memes, people, and data) which dropped me right into the team @ Rainbow Wallet🌈 . Here I spent my time at Rainbow dreaming of ways to help onboard the next generation of crypto users through an accessible interface as simple but impactful as a crypto wallet.\n\nBut with Rainbow being my *Chapter Zero*, a proverbial foreword to my ongoing and seemingly never-ending adventure in crypto, I’m super thrilled to begin *Chapter One* of my crypto journey with an amazing team, and even more importantly the amazing community of crypto that has brought me to where I am.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n34OYKT8Y6MmXuU9iZLvC.png?height=500&width=666)\n\n**Let’s Connect!**\n\nThe next few months are going to be fast paced, productive, and invigorating which I can’t wait to lean into and bring y’all on the ride as well. I’m always looking for more people to vibe on crazy ideas with and chat about community, growth, biz dev, and anything meme-related in crypto.

No-one before had imagined that a blockchain can be attacked and forced to be halted. \n\n \n Well that’s what happened to the **TERRA** network. Its native token LUNA lost 100% of its value.\n\n![LUNA Market history over past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_a6dKTArZU9hpPtcX9tbV.png?height=382&width=488)\n\n## Stable Coins\n\nThere are two types of currencies in blockchain, one that you want to increase in prices i.e. the native tokens so that you can gain high ROI’s e.g. Ether, BTC etc. Other one is stable-coins, you want these to stay near 1$ i.e. their initial pegging. They are programmed in such a way that they stay low. They are considered the safe channel if you want to go long on your assets. For a better understanding, you can relate them with government securities in terms of traditional trading, they don’t offer high ROI’s but profits are guaranteed even if they are low. There are many such tokens as Tether’s USD, or US Center government’s USDC**.** \n\n## UST-LUNA\n\nLike USDT, USDC, **TERRA** network has its own stable-coin UST. Now unlike other stable-coins, which are backed up by liquidity in form of real money in the banks, UST is an algorithmically stable coin. Do Kwon, founder of the Terra network, designed this token. As per the theory, UST is 1:1 pegged to Terra’s LUNA. It means UST holders can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA by burning the UST and minting LUNA.\n\n## Attack Phase -1\n\nUST doesn’t have any other utility other than Terra’s most popular [Anchor Protocol](https://www.anchorprotocol.com/#). Anchor offers 20% yield for deposits, this is far more than any other protocol. But this deal is only effective to the UST, no other stable-coins, be it USDC, USDT. \n\nAs per April end, 72% of all the UST was locked into Anchor, estimated around 14 billion dollars.\n\nImagine a bank offering 20% interest on your deposits, obviously everyone would go to that bank and earn that pretty money. That’s what happened with Anchor, as the time passed, the number of lenders increased, but the number of borrowers kept decreasing, in this case a proposal was drawn and it was clear that those pretty 20% interest rates were not going to stand. \n\nAfter hearing the news, people started pulling their locked UST out from Anchor. Since there is no other use of UST, people started getting out of the Terra network\n\n[Anchor Docs](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/)\n\n## Attack Phase -2\n\nNow to exit UST, there are two options, one- the inbuilt burn and mint mechanism, where one can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA, Second option is stable-coin exchange, Curve Finance.\n\nCurve provides liquidity pools for stable coins, same existed for UST too, specifically (UST+3crv pool).\n\nWhen people took out their UST they started swapping it into the curve pool. It increased the amount of UST and decreased the amount of other stable-coins, resulting in the destabilization of the pool.  \n\nTo make things worse, at least one individual dumped about $85 Million worth UST tokens, and exchanged them for USDC. This created an imbalance in the pool. Now to tip the scales back, according to the protocols, Anchor starts offering UST at a discounted price. This was the initial step in de-pegging of UST. This eventually resulted in the drowning of LUNA in the market.\n\n![Transaction showing deposit of $85 Million worth UST](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8i8MY1SsFCuLvCtGvj89p.png?height=390&width=600)\n\n## Attack Phase -3\n\nNow every blockchain has a safe guard which steps in at the moment of crisis. Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) was Terra’s shield in this case. It dumped non-UST stable-coins worth approximately $216 Million into the curve pool to regain the balance. This technique did work for sometime but the prices continued to degrade as people continued to get out of Terra. Panic played a crucial role in the plummeting of the Market, traders/investors lost their trust in Terra. \n\nNow to compensate for the loss in the portfolios, people started selling their other assets to absorb the shock. This resulted in the falling of the market altogether.\n\nDo Kwon had already thought about any incident of such kind, some time later after launching UST, he started buying Bitcoin as safe reserves. But those reserves were not enough to compensate for the destruction.\n\nThis kind of attack forced the blockchain to halt, a decision collectively taken by all the nodes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter the whole month of analyzing , it’s safe to say that we still are at a very early stage, there’s a lot to learn, a lot to unravel, a lot to study. One has to take every step very cautiously because it’s real money at stake here. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1654273711, "digest": "Xup_PA8A5ZGz0bA_7TKb8sp8GgSPuJWSQ-qn00aSnWI", "contributor": "0xC6036B8c3F911f936b661a075CFAA4B802b75cc3"}

We believe in building a “multi-chapter story” with the founders we invest in. We strive to become a venture contributor fund — getting our hands dirty helping on multiple fronts such as Founder Experience, Talent and Education, or Product with founders when they need us.\n\nJeff and Mene have assembled a fantastic group of immensely talented individuals who come from diverse backgrounds — bringing with them an arsenal of incredible experiences that can be immediately applied to the day-to-day work that we do regardless of the scenario thrown at us.\n\nI’m so excited to dive into the themes that Chapter One believes in:\n\n* **Multiplayer Money**: crypto being the foundation of unlocking group coordination\n* **Next Billion Owners:** onboarding the next generation of crypto users\n* **Cult Communities:** a focus point for helping unlock radical thinkers to manifest their ideas\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YFoFewVthgf2WPNL5PTXM.png?height=348&width=717)\n\n**WHY Community and Growth?**\n\nFundamentally, there will come a time when yields taper and the world of crypto no longer flouts outrageous APY's or gains to entice newcomers. Those that continue to evangelize crypto and its community will do it, not because of speculative monetary gains, but because of the right onboarding experience.\n\nI believe that communities that border on cults will help onboard, lock-in, and engage the next generation of crypto natives. Protocols and products that create advocates who bring in others because they are convicted will create an essential flywheel of onboarding with a positive feedback loop.\n\nCommunity and in conjunction growth are now an integral part of the fabric of culture in general and in crypto especially. It creates an infinitely scalable opportunity that encompasses anything from marketing activations to technical breakthroughs on a grassroots level.\n\nThis has been my primary focus and a nascent point of excitement since I entered crypto in 2020 and I aim to have the privilege of working on it as long as I can.\n\n![(ignore the above meme - I actually do stuff outside of making memes) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vrOr0vJUWjjDe8V_H4p00.png?height=499&width=517)\n\n**So, what does my role look like?**\n\nAs Head of Community and Growth, I’ll be working directly with portfolio companies to create uniquely personalized journeys for the founders we work with.\n\nI’ll be doing this by examining what the founders want for their community of users, brainstorming what long term growth might look like with each company, and working with other parts of Chapter One (Founder Experience, Talent and Education, Research and Experiments) to create the most holistic experience for Chapter One’s portfolio.\n\nIn addition, I’m excited to dive into developing and curating resources surrounding community, growth, and business development and open-sourcing anything I find for the public good. Long term, I hope to build robust connections within the space to generate content that helps surface best practices for decentralized communities, internal and external, as well as scalable GTM playbooks for companies of all shapes and sizes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MDeBKe1oIdvwb5ZBjog0Z.png?height=500&width=1000)\n\n**What brought me here?**\n\nI’ve always been a big believer in trying and experiencing first before judging. This has brought me on a wild journey where I submerged myself into different fields from the government defense industry, airline industry, spatial work startups, to multi-billion hedge funds — ultimately landing in crypto where I now call home.\n\nI think it would be remiss to not highlight a few formative experiences below.\n\n* **Delta** ✈️ - my first job as a sophomore in college.\n  * From the first day where I could barely figure my way around the spreadsheet maze, to my last month (a year and a half later) where I was responsible for staffing entire airports on my own using scripts and processes I had worked on. Oh yea, also the free flights worldwide, those were nice.\n* **Zeet** 💻 - my first introduction to startups.\n  * This job was an important view into how a good leader can unlock and empower someone to achieve much more than they could ever imagine. Here I was able to self-start, own, and execute high-leverage projects with little oversight and a lot of encouragement. Shoutout to Johnny Dallas (+ frens), where without them I for sure wouldn’t be where I am now.\n* **Branch** ✨ - my first FT(ish) job.\n  * This job gave me the first glimpse into the serendipity that could be possible in the metaverse. Being a Customer Success Manager I was able to see the direct impact my interactions could have in a B2B/B2C context as well as how important education was for a product regardless of how intuitive it might seem, an essential lesson, especially in crypto.\n* **Special mention to D.E. Shaw**🏦 - a look into the trad-fi void.\n  * This gave me an intimate inside look into the vast world of finance that remains abysmally archaic for the everyday person. From learning about how markets were made to the complex technical systems that facilitate the millisecond trades executed on a day-to-day basis. This look behind the curtain gave me the push I needed to finally land me permanently into crypto.\n\nFinding myself glued to everything crypto. It led me down a rabbit hole of learning and finding what I was passionate about (memes, people, and data) which dropped me right into the team @ Rainbow Wallet🌈 . Here I spent my time at Rainbow dreaming of ways to help onboard the next generation of crypto users through an accessible interface as simple but impactful as a crypto wallet.\n\nBut with Rainbow being my *Chapter Zero*, a proverbial foreword to my ongoing and seemingly never-ending adventure in crypto, I’m super thrilled to begin *Chapter One* of my crypto journey with an amazing team, and even more importantly the amazing community of crypto that has brought me to where I am.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n34OYKT8Y6MmXuU9iZLvC.png?height=500&width=666)\n\n**Let’s Connect!**\n\nThe next few months are going to be fast paced, productive, and invigorating which I can’t wait to lean into and bring y’all on the ride as well. I’m always looking for more people to vibe on crazy ideas with and chat about community, growth, biz dev, and anything meme-related in crypto.

Since there is no other use of UST, people started getting out of the Terra network\n\n[Anchor Docs](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/)\n\n## Attack Phase -2\n\nNow to exit UST, there are two options, one- the inbuilt burn and mint mechanism, where one can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA, Second option is stable-coin exchange, Curve Finance.\n\nCurve provides liquidity pools for stable coins, same existed for UST too, specifically (UST+3crv pool).\n\nWhen people took out their UST they started swapping it into the curve pool. It increased the amount of UST and decreased the amount of other stable-coins, resulting in the destabilization of the pool.\n\nTo make things worse, at least one individual dumped about $85 Million worth UST tokens, and exchanged them for USDC. This created an imbalance in the pool. Now to tip the scales back, according to the protocols, Anchor starts offering UST at a discounted price. This was the initial step in de-pegging of UST. This eventually resulted in the drowning of LUNA in the market.\n\n![Transaction showing deposit of $85 Million worth UST](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8i8MY1SsFCuLvCtGvj89p.png?height=390&width=600)\n\n## Attack Phase -3\n\nEvery blockchain has a safe guard which steps in at the moment of crisis. Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) was Terra’s shield in this case. It dumped non-UST stable-coins worth approximately $216 Million into the curve pool to regain the balance. This technique did work for sometime but the prices continued to degrade as people continued to get out of Terra. Panic played a crucial role in the plummeting of the Market, traders/investors lost their trust in Terra.\n\nNow to compensate for the loss in the portfolios, people started selling their other assets to absorb the shock. This resulted in the falling of the market altogether.\n\nDo Kwon had already thought about any incident of such kind, some time later after launching UST, he started buying Bitcoin as safe reserves. But those reserves were not enough to compensate for the destruction.\n\nThis kind of attack forced the blockchain to halt, a decision collectively taken by all the nodes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter the whole month of analyzing , it’s safe to say that we still are at a very early stage, there’s a lot to learn, a lot to unravel, a lot to study. One has to take every step very cautiously because it’s real money at stake here.", "timestamp": 1654274181, "digest": "Xup_PA8A5ZGz0bA_7TKb8sp8GgSPuJWSQ-qn00aSnWI", "contributor": "0xC6036B8c3F911f936b661a075CFAA4B802b75cc3"}

{"id": "7QErkOlpsRwvWTO6wURvXG1C7_bru974ZU0J7isxXCI", "title": "Forecasting a Music NFT Drop", "body": "## Vérité - “He’s Not You” via Royal\n\n*(scroll down to view forecast)*\n\nIn music’s Web3 future, everyone can be an investor, backing their favorite artists and projects. This shift towards an open and democratized support system between creator and collector has the potential to change the economic structure of the music industry and the artist-fan relationship — for the better. Much better, if things unfold properly.\n\nWith each passing day, more artists are coming up with creative ways to offer non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Since June 2020, there have been 1.68M music NFTs sold, generating just under $100M in primary sale revenue (*Water & Music, Jan 2022*). It would take \\~23.7 Billion streams to generate that same revenue for artists.\n\n![Music NFT primary revenue total and number of streams for artists to accrue this revenue (Water & Music, Jan 2022).](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XIpsoNER3OxSx6Dqa5E9V.png?height=347&width=805)\n\n## Royalty-bearing NFTs\n\nOne type of NFT offering with real disruptive power is the royalty-bearing NFT (sometimes referred to as S-NFTs); those in which artists offer a portion of their royalty share to collectors. This mechanism allows collectors to own a fractionalized portion of a song, album, or even catalog, and share in its future success. For artists, this atypical influx of capital can jumpstart their careers, fund their creative projects, build community, and detach them from the traditional, often predatory, economic structure of the music industry.\n\nRoyalty-bearing NFT drops have been met with intense excitement recently as the earliest drops from platforms Royal (Nas and 3LAU) and Opulous (Lil Pump and Soulja Boy) sold out in minutes.\n\nOn Monday, Royal announced their next drop: 39% of the streaming royalties in Vérité’s single “He’s Not You”*.*\n\n![Ownership royalties and benefits by token level for Vérité's 'He's Not You' NFT drop (Royal.io).](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DtfNDTwlcukP3O5RKcLmx.png?height=1510&width=2206&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n## Discoverability\n\nThus far it seems only established artists are being featured in these early S-NFT drops. This makes sense as it’s early days — but in order to empower creators of all sizes with these resources, we need new tools for discovery and understanding value.\n\n***If music’s Web3 future doesn’t solve discoverability, then NFTs will only enrich artists with preexisting name value and community. This isn’t the future we believe in.***\n\nWe are building data-driven ai models that look at audio patterns and incorporate insights from our research on the neuroscience of music enjoyment$^1$ to find songs that push boundaries optimally and are positioned to over-perform expectation if given the right attention. As the space becomes flooded with more S-NFTs in the coming years, we believe this technology will shine a light on the hidden gems and connect them to supportive collectors, so that all sides can fairly share in the rewards.\n\n***It is difficult for collectors and creators to understand the future royalty value of these NFTs***. We have created a platform that fills this need — [dopr](https://www.dopr.com/) — where collectors will be able to value, discover, and track music NFTs.\n\n## Vérité Forecast\n\ndopr provides 5-year forecasts for streaming and royalty earnings (by quarter), cumulative stats, and a recoupment calculator which breaks down the number of streams and length of time needed for a token-holder to break even.\n\nTo view the full forecast and get early access to dopr click [here](https://www.dopr.com).\n\n![Five-years streams and earnings forecast for Vérité's drop.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mJyUrri_XUrp3NSdJ-wFg.png?height=1634&width=2270)\n\n### In the five year period dopr predicted:\n\n* On-Demand Streams: **2.5M**\n* Total Earnings: **$10.2k**\n* Gold Token Earnings: **$5**\n* Platinum Token Earnings: **$23**\n* Diamond Token Earnings: **$88**\n\nThe drop offers Gold, Platinum, and Diamond tokens, which all have different costs, royalty shares, and additional benefits. dopr shows the expected royalty earnings for each token over a five-year period. dopr estimates that the tokens wouldn’t be recouped through royalties for more than 200 years (Gold), 125 years (Platinum), and 80 years (Diamond).\n\n![The recoupment calculator estimates the time and streams needed for token owners to breakeven, along with other details for each offering.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Qzwe4EmycvNzPUdZdjSOa.png?height=426&width=2270)\n\nThe recoupment calculator displays the costs associated with each token, cost per 1%, royalty share, and streams and time needed to breakeven. On its face, the tokens’ pricing and expected revenue to be generated for ‘he’s not you’ don’t seem to align.\n\nHowever, much of the craze resonating among music S-NFT collectors isn’t focused on the royalty payouts. For a portion of collectors, their value is realized through fandom, social badging, scarcity, and even private experiences, such as the 1:1 video chat Vérité is offering the five Diamond token owners. Each token level has additional benefits beyond the % royalties owned:\n\n* **Gold**: Signed Cassette Tape, Exclusive Access to Vérité NFT Collector Discord channel\n* **Platinum**: Exclusive \"He's Not You\" Vérité Discord access, Plus all Gold Extras\n* **Diamond**: 1:1 Video Call with Vérité, Plus all Gold and Platinum Extras\n\nFor her biggest fans, the chance to have a 1:1 video chat may be priceless. This is in addition to the value these tokens may maintain on the secondary market (attached to royalty value), or in the intangible value of supporting, community, and collectorship.\n\nUltimately, supporting artists and the platforms aiming to empower them in this space has much value in its own right.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nWe envision a future where the 50M worldwide music creators are funded directly from supportive collectors, with all sharing in the rewards. Help us make this a reality.\n\nGet early access [here](https://www.dopr.com).\n\n[www.dopr.com](https://www.dopr.com)\n\n[www.twitter.com/dopr_ai](https://www.twitter.com/dopr_ai)", "timestamp": 1654275370, "digest": "0t6ePJYklo98ua4xceE_92GB0jWJYOSK5ujBi-SJ00k", "contributor": "0x0ac073bAB13cFacd44A5Dc7b063035E43A223014"}

Rebels是谁？\n\n> 通过融合艺术和技术，改变我们的数字身份。\n\n项目本身是一个3D PFP，总发行量为13370个。**Sudo** ?个， ***Leet*高级白**1337个，**白名单**7331个。剩余数量会作为公售全部释出。Rebels的愿景是将叛军作为NFT项目之间的桥梁成为个人身份标志（DID）。项目的灵感来自于很多不同的方向：巴黎的时尚、Apex的游戏画风、以及世界各地的反抗者们。\n\n团队在2021年12月开始了Rebels的孵化，起初创始人发现了一个NFT的普遍问题：单一的NFT局限了用户的展示性，用户无法通过头像去展示自己持有的NFTs，通常需要通过横幅聚合器才可以做到展示持有的NFTs。因此我们需要一个方法去更好的展示我们的NFTs。Rebels便应运而生。\n\n项目最大的亮点在于其主打的可定制化NFT和可编程性，NFT定制化让一张Rebels的NFT作为底图，搭配其独有的徽章系统，使得其他项目的 NFT 可以当作衣服上的徽章所展示。这样，仅凭一张 NFT 就可以进入各大NFT项目， 然后展现自己持有或做出贡献的项目。Rebels持有者将会被赋予该NFTs的**商业权限**。这个商业权包含了之后的版权和商业使用。例如：潮牌服装，Sub DAO, 周边，二次创作盈利等。\n\nMint信息， mint价格和数量都是基于a16z已有的数据进行分析之后得出的。从AMA的回答来看，Nass至少参考了市面上上百个项目。除此之外，Nass许多决策也效仿了a16z之前的[文章](https://a16z.com/2022/03/31/nft-mint-data-early-decisions/)：“The NFT Mint ‘Sweet Spot’: Data on Early Decisions”中提及的一些建议。例如以较低的mint价格，帮助用户提高回报率。\n\n* **Mint**时间：**6月12号**\n* **Sudo**   可以mint**三**个：**free + free + 0.08e + Gas**\n* **Leet**    可以mint**二**个：**free + 0.08e + Gas**\n* **白名单**

创始人，在设计、零售和区块链方面的经验使她成为项目的完美顾问。在NFT领域为Rebels的大局做出了贡献，并与创始人一起制定未来计划。\n\n## 路线图\n\n关于路线图，Nass本人曾多次强调不喜欢过多的描述未来会做的，而是着重于做什么说什么。因此项目的进程基本只能透过AMA得知。\n\n**首次AMA** - 02月12号 - 主题为项目方doxxed，项目起因，和生态构建的愿景。本次AMA，Nass首次提出了定制化概念，但却并未透露太多信息。\n\n**第二次AMA** - 03月20号 - 高级白1337（LEET）公布，mint数量和大致时间公布。更具体的讲解了定制化NFT的概念，以及社区的运营方针。\n\n**第三次AMA** - 04月13号 - 本次AMA回答了社区内部的一些疑惑，重点讲解了定制化NFT的核心和技术概述，以及生态的可能性。\n\n**第四次中文区flash AMA** - 04月27号 - 徽章系统和合约使用问题\n\n**第五次中文space AMA** - 5月7号 - 新技术亮点透露，冷钱包技术。中文区运营方针，合约安全和sub DAO支持\n\n**第六次AMA -** 5月28号 - 主要公布了mint的时间与计划\n\n## 定制化NFT\n\nRebels与其他项目有着很多区别，这也是为什么我会长久的在这个社区里进行知识分享。其中最独特的莫过于其独创的定制化系统。Rebels NFT将会作为一个基点，通过patch徽章系统，允许用户佩戴不同的徽章去展示其持有的NFT。例如一个用户持有BAYC，那么这个用户可以通过定制化系统，把持有的BAYC佩戴到Rebels NFT上。由此一来，用户便能透过一个NFT去打通多个社区。我们将其称之为桥梁——NFT桥梁。\n\n**定制化流程**\n\n* Patch系统是目前最主要的定制化选项\n* 正在评估定制化在技术上的可行性（feasibility），将会有更深入的定制化选项\n* 背景颜色的定制可能性，项目方正在讨论当中，可能在未来开放\n* 项目方将会在未来开放越来越多的定制化选项\n* 定制化流程\n  * 官方网站互动界面\n  * 选择开放的定制化选项\n  * 选择在何处放置patch\n  * 交互上链\n  * 尽可能流畅的用户体验\n\n### Patch\n\n徽章系统，顾名思义，每个徽章都是一个NFT，将徽章佩戴需要借助官网交互。从目前的信息来看徽章NFT可以分为三种：\n\n* 钱包内的NFT\n\n\n* 首批NFT认证将会聚焦于认证的蓝筹，例如Yuga Labs的项目，MoonBirds，Invisible Friends, Doodles。帮助项目宣传\n* 之后会基于Opensea认证来增加这个名单。\n\n\n* 官方提供的一次性徽章，主要为纪念作用\n  * 例如高级白 1337的成员会有独有的LEET徽章去证明1337对社区的贡献。\n  * 但转售时这类徽章将被销毁，同时，一旦佩戴**疑似**不可逆\n* 官方提供的持久徽章\n\n\n* 初期会和设计师，和艺术家合作\n* 之后可能开放**二创**\n\n**转售**\n\n* 当转卖叛军NFT时，patch的变动分两种情况\n\n\n* 如果绑定了官方提供的patch，则patch跟随NFT一起售卖\n* 如果绑定了钱包里的其他NFT，交易成功后这一patch会消失\n\n**冷钱包创新：**\n\n当Rebels的NFTs储存在冷钱包，用户仍可以在官网上进行定制化更改，给NFT上Patch。通过这个创新机制，用户可以最大限度的保证NFTs安全。\n\n**合约**\n\n从目前的信息来看，721A并非最优选择。721A的创新在于打包Mint，但是在面对转移时仍旧面临高额的Gas费用。从已收到的消息来看，可能会基于721x去重新构建一套体系。除了基础的mint合约，定制化交互合约也是团队的重心之一。团队目前讨论了许多方法，并试图提取各个方法的优点，从而创建独有的合约标准。\n\n**安全措施**\n\n* Discord安全性，discord安全管理是业内非常专业著名工程师，经常是第一个对业内事件做出反应。nass等创始人也没有discord完全权限。\n* 合约编写方面是业界有十几年经验的软件工程师，还请到了加密领域合约审计最优秀的人来审计。兼顾内部和外部审核，以及压力测试。\n* 在Mint之前，合约将会在GitHub**完全公开**，届时会开启**bug bounty**\n\n## 项目分析\n\n### 社群运营\n\n以Discord和Twitter为主，因为a16z的运营策略，人均加密KOL。这个对项目本身也是利好。在第二次space AMA中，我们发现了7名a16z加密组成员，虽然a16z无法官宣支持，据Nass透露，项目有受到a16z成员的帮助和支持。Nass自己经常会发twitter去阐述他的理想和想法，这使得社区的凝聚力变得更强。\n\n目前Discord人数为73.7K人，活跃用户在5k\\~6k左右。\n\n目前Twitter关注人数为86K人，平均点赞为1.4k\\~2k，4月22号的图片释出达到高峰7.2K。\n\nWL主要聚焦成员的活跃，虽然无固定规则，但是审核机制十分严谨。具有两层审核。有别于其他项目Rebels的Mod，并无发放权力只有提名权力。每个Mod都有着丰富的项目经历，借助这些经历才能更好的辨别机器人和工作室，试图最大限度的把白名单给到真正为社区做贡献的成员。同时成员之间也有提名权，当一个成员正真深得人心的时候，成员便会自发的去提名。另外，从高级白的发放也可以看到，社区对早期成员的贡献的认可。目前白名单人数为3.58k，高级白人数为527，SUDO人数为4人。\n\n###

外部合作\n\n对于外部合作，Nass更希望与社区内部建立长期的合作，建立社区之间的桥梁，以我们的艺术与技术为重点。我们会与自己（Rebels）社区NFT或画家进行合作。比如x0r，3lau。同时Nass觉得和其他项目合作进行~~交换~~WL交换的意义并不是很大，项目之间共享社区成员，会导致成员在社区的参与感或贡献度降低。WL合作越多，越容易拉进来墙头草。其实抽奖发白，WL合作所面向的仍然是同一批用户。\n\n## 个人分析\n\nRebels应该说是我接触到的第一个项目，也因为此项目认识到了很多人，接触到了web3的内核，去寻找自己在这个行业的理由。我为什么想要写这篇研报？~~，~~我为什么热爱这个项目？~~，~~我为什么能拿到Sudo？~~。~~下面我从我~~自己~~的亲身经验和体验进行了个人想法的阐述~~探讨~~，所有信息都是由这几个月的亲身经历~~体验，~~总结下来的。最后还是想说，我仅代表我本人的看法~~的看法只是我的看法~~，DYOR才是这个圈子最重要的。\n\n### 反抗\n\n我们在文章初期提及了这个项目的原意是反抗，那么我们究竟为何反抗，反抗什么？目前我们正在经历熊市，希望能度过这个难关。熊市学习，牛市fomo。但是牛市的fomo真的是好事吗。纵观过往的这几个月，看到了很多也体验了很多。目前的市场仿佛被fomo的情绪带动，宛如围城，墙外的人想进来，墙内的人麻木不仁。各种项目方都在许~~承~~诺项目可以给持有者带来多大的利益而却忽视了NFT的艺术~~用心制作NFT~~和创新。甚至不少项目方匿名卷钱跑路，这对NFT是一个好的发展吗？或者说如果持续下去，NFT的市场还有什么意义和炒作的价值吗。如果NFT不寻求突破性的发展，而是保持发图卷钱跑路三连操作甚至会受到各国政府的监管打压。\n\nRebels创始人nass在推特上不止一次的对这类项目的各种情况做出了批判。\n\n[https://twitter.com/nassyweazy/status/1524404256836661248?s=20&t=_oOx2HxOuQGsZwkyjV5EFg](https://twitter.com/nassyweazy/status/1524404256836661248?s=20&t=_oOx2HxOuQGsZwkyjV5EFg)\n\nNass认为NFT就应该保持区块链去中心化的精神，以保持更好的公平性。\n\n[https://twitter.com/nassyweazy/status/1480675700264759297](https://twitter.com/nassyweazy/status/1480675700264759297)\n\n### 背景\n\n从6次的AMA中发现，Nass是个十分有认知的项目发起人，合理利用a16z的资源去帮助他成功是这个项目最终能成功的一大助力。另一个我十分欣赏的地方在于，Nass有参考之前的项目，解析项目代码去改进。Nass：“我们分析了BAYC的合约，发现他们并没有优化transfer函数，我们通过分析他们的项目从而改善我们的合约”。目前很多NFT项目都发生了严重的合约问题，尽管很多问题都已有解决方案，可是很多项目依旧照犯了。 对比Nass和其他项目创始人，我们可以看到，强大的背景带来的不只是技术，还有对历史的尊重。**借鉴历史**，**从历史学习。**\n\n### 共识\n\n在加密领域之中共识的地位举足轻重，一个项目的价值取决于其是否有着良好的共识机制，共识又取决于价值，而目前大多数NFT项目的共识仅来自于地板价。但是，价值并不仅仅局限于资金价值，信息知识和人脉这些间接但是持久的价值也是不可忽略的，Rebels里面的成员通过知识共享建立了一个类似技术论坛的社区空间，每周二会举办分享会，亦或是每天早上/晚上的复盘。这些聊天内容实际上给Rebels成员提供了特别的价值。Rebels的中文社区尝试帮助新加入的NFT新人实现从0到1的转变。\n\n### 激励\n\n在NFT中，很多人买一个NFT图片当做头像。不只是为了好看喜欢，更多的是想对别人展现你NFT的价值。NFTs是一个集美学、赞助、地位、收藏和社交的混合资产。就拿BAYC持有者来说，通常此类持有者同时也会是其他的蓝筹持有者。但是目前的PFP功能受限于单个NFTs的展出。当然有多个NFT展示的方法，例如半分法的融合，但是此类NFT便无法通过NFT审核和认证。Rebels此时便可以成为这个桥梁去链接不同的NFT社区，让用户可以展示自己的持有或是热爱的图。\n\n我认为财务价值的主要形式有两种。\n\n* 第一个是团队可以控制的，是创建人们想要使用的产品。第二种方式是社区为人们创造参与的理由\n* 第二个则是运动。人们参加运动是因为他们喜欢这项运动。体育运动的副产品可以是健康和社会效益。人们可能会加入后者，但这项运动是核心。\n\n![这个是Ohhshiny特制的Rebels NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UHPr4gpVLNJQKfFxXji5W.png?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n### 玩法分析\n\n定制化的玩法是很有趣的想法，透过定制化用户不在受制于单个头像，以~~一个~~头像加徽章的方式可以向其他人展现持有者参与的其他项目或是持有的其他NFT。徽章也有很多很多可能性：~~，~~NFT on NFT 直接的提供了二创以及衍生的可能性；~~，~~一个艺术家未来可能不一定需要在Opensea发布NFT转而制作徽章系列，类似社交媒体的表情包系列；~~。~~亦或是~~或者~~透过某个徽章，成员可以去自发的组建subDAO。\n\n在最近的思考和交流中，社区内成员提出成就概念。如今有很多项目会发放POAP，POAP的核心概念很像传统游戏中的成就。那么我们是否可以延展成就系统，一种成就是传统的POAP，另一种成就是基于初始持有者，例如持有时间超过500天，项目方便会发放一个钻石手的成就。因此徽章不会局限于一部分内容，可能性是更多的。\n\n## RebelsLabs\n\n> Rebels Labs是NFT项目Rebels中文社区所提出的subDAO概念。\n\n### 理念\n\n其理念在于最大化利用Rebels独创的徽章系统的潜力，将徽章转换成广告位，从而实现广告产业从web2到web3的转变。当每一个Rebels持有者都佩戴着某个项目的徽章时，我们的原生流量估算在7k左右，通过7k持有者分散传播进而引导社交裂变，从而形成web3独有的病毒式宣传方式。\n\nRebels Labs可提供以下几种营销服务\n\n* Rebels Labs的网站将会展示所有合作伙伴的项目介绍及内部调研，将有一个评分系统，将项目进行评级，从而为项目进行宣传。\n* Rebels Labs的官方Twitter进行Giveaway形式的宣传。\n* 所有Rebels Labs成员将进行转推，转推成功后将获得相对应的代币或者积分进行奖励。\n* 将由NFT领域经验丰富的团队专属定制新兴NFT项目的广告、营销策略、宣发模式等。\n* 可以为发售结束的NFT项目进行实体周边的定制，这是Rebels Labs背靠全球轻工业巨头——中国所拥有的天然优势。\n\nRebels Labs将“球衣广告位”为蓝本，力求在Web3世界中绘制一副更为宏伟的广告蓝图。\n\nRebels Labs也不仅仅局限于广告，也将为NFT项目进行营销咨询的服务，真正做到，让每一位艺术家都可以大胆放肆得去挥毫泼墨，而营销运营我们将为其处理，从而使创作者得到更多的收益。\n\n### 优势\n\nRebels Labs的优势：将成为一辆不断在NFT领域内运行的地铁，每一位NFT旅程中的乘客都可以在这辆地铁上看到不同的广告。我们的优势在于，每一位Rebels Labs的成员的Twitte账号都会有大量的NFT相关的内容，而看到我们广告的人群，也将会是有大部分的NFT玩家，所以我们的广告投放将会极富有针对性，这便是Rebels Labs广告的优势所在。\n\n倘若Rebels成为蓝筹，那么每个独立叛军的胸口将会成为NFT的时代广场。这将是一块尚未开垦的处女地，在Web3世界当中，尚未有一个完整且成功的广告公司，而Rebels Labs将填补这块空缺！\n\n## 最后结语\n\n最后我想感谢 @lunatic, @neken.eth, @唐古特牧羊人，@travy~~臭小子~~，@皮卡星，@冰墩墩，@June，@youyu，@ALAN， @anni。还有所有的社区小伙伴，因为大家努力才能使社区进步。\n\n我还想特别感谢 @[舟舟

It is scarce. 1 of 1. In the case of infringement of your rights as copyright holder, [it can be advantageous to have formally registered the work](https://www.artbusiness.com/register_and_copyright_art_for_artists.html), however the fact remains that digital media is scarce at the point of creation.\n\nThat these critiques often come from corners who mistakenly characterize crypto as a fraudulent fiction is ironic, as the premise that the digital media we enjoy on previous internets is not scarcely owned by anyone is fictitious. No scarcity is being *imposed* on media, existing scarcity is being *surfaced* and experimented with.\n\nThis is the brilliance of the NFT experiment. NFTs represent an elegant proposal to attempt what I would describe as **feasible abundance**. I.e how can we make free media fair for the people creating it?\n\nDecades deep into the internet experiment we had not yet found a way to reconcile our desire to have as many people as possible enjoy media, while also making life financially feasible for the creators of that work. NFTs create games and value exchange around ownership and collection abstracted above access to the content itself, which ought to be available to everyone. As [Jacob.eth articulates](https://cryptomedia.wtf/), the experiment proposes that the more a work is freely available, shared and memed, the more valuable ownership of that work becomes. As such, it is almost impossible to find a piece of NFT art locked behind a token gated wall. In real terms, *meaningful scarcity* would mean withholding that access.\n\nThis premise also explains why many of the most celebrated early NFT auctions from within the Ethereum community were held to retroactively compensate popular memes, from [Nyan Cat](https://foundation.app/@NyanCat/foundation/219) to [Disaster Girl](https://foundation.app/@DisasterGirl/foundation/25046). The values put forward by many corners of the NFT community are that media ought to be freely available, and that free media ought to be valuable. Information is now free *and* expensive. To achieve both states to the satisfaction of all parties at this immature stage is a minor miracle and to be celebrated.\n\nThis accomplishment is made possible through experimentation with previously hidden dynamics, and foregrounding them can be startling to those who were not previously aware of their existence. I call this phenomenon **the shock of the nude**.\n\nMany critics of crypto and NFTs mistakenly suggest that crypto is introducing financialization, inequity or scarcity to our digital lives. This is false. Public blockchains, through making visible latent forces such as financing, unequal returns, or scarce and valuable ownership, are bringing long existing dynamics to the surface to be scrutinized. These forces are not *new*, they are *nude*.\n\nOur previous internet lives are financialized daily on interfaces most of us do not have access to. Web 2 has concentrated wealth and attention to a handful of players at the top (who often most dutifully serve the objectives and accept the universal terms of a handful of platforms), but few other than professional insiders *have seen* the full extent to which this is true.\n\nWhat often emerges on twitter is people with a casual, idealistic, fan-side relationship with media condescending those with a longstanding commitment and understanding of their respective industries. This gulf in knowledge becomes apparent when critics are invited to propose their own alternatives to the current state of the web for creators, with highly RTable but practically infeasible ideas ranging from [laborious illegible key exchanges on a private database](https://blog.mollywhite.net/digital-artists-post-bubble-hopes-for-nfts-dont-need-a-blockchain/) (i.e like a blockchain but way worse) to [vague allusions to revive failed state based internets from 50 years ago](https://reallifemag.com/reconnected/). These ideas sound nice to an equally inexperienced crowd, but are unserious and do not stand to help anyone but their authors. If only things were so easy!\n\nAn unsurprising byproduct of a web modeled to facilitate advertising, it is often quite difficult to discern between solid information and promotional misdirection on Web 2.  There is a significant discrepancy between the statistics the public has access to and the hard financial and industrial realities obscured by them.\n\nIn the arts, the followers and stream numbers we see are a very distorted indicator of how well the person in question is doing financially, and say little of how people actually make a living. Due to tired dynamics of self promotion and brand construction encouraged by web 2 platforms, there is little incentive for anyone to disclose that they are struggling or in a precarious position. Crypto’s public ledgers shatter illusions and hold potential of unveiling sobering truths. **Web 2 is the grift.** **Web 3 is a gift**. It is not morally sound to accept that many people are committing their 20s and 30s to participating in a fiction while silently struggling, adrift of access to good information.\n\nOnly once the warts-and-all truth is made visible do we have any hope of addressing how the world actually works. The shock of the nude may be a cold shower, but a dose of reality is far more useful to practicing artists or internet denizens than a fictitious understanding of  the web and creative industries. Access to more accurate information outside of the promotional mirage of likes and follows is an uncontroversial good for anyone aspiring to make a living.\n\nThat said, while public ledgers make it quite difficult for many to pretend that things are going better than they actually are, there is no shortage of illusion creation on public blockchains too. For a minority who have the means, it is possible to distort perceptions by illicitly pumping bags, making anonymous acquisitions and the like. **Public ledgers are no panacea**, however I find it far preferable that such coordinated distortions be legible and open to scrutiny. As discussed [in our podcast with Context.app](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/making-web3-human-legible-constructive-speculation-and-the-shock-of-the-nude-with-context), more tools are being built to make on-chain activity human legible.\n\nIt will become harder and harder over time to get away with as new forms of journalism are made possible through the ability to track foul play, even retroactively. As [Taylor Monahan recently suggested on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1532085029857284101?s=20&t=UeymocOPtyFVEUOwwmhR8A), so far often the best policing of foul play in crypto has come from within crypto itself, and that accountability will spread as more learn how to read on-chain activity.\n\nYou can follow me [@matdryhurst](http://twitter.com/matdryhurst) on twitter\n\nWe discuss matters like this with wonderful guests weekly [on the Interdependence podcast](https://interdependence.fm/)", "timestamp": 1654274950, "digest": "_sXRcv5Mvc_2__hnfJ4WdNaoxSuqycV-TZKHYFXr1FQ", "contributor": "0xB1F6C97F4D2FEBa6b128F7B6D364E1ED1dca0b99"}

Por eso como inversores es importante identificar proyectos con fuentes de ingresos reales.\n\nEs necesario conocer de donde provienen los ingresos que luego generan los APR.\n\nAlgunos ejemplos de son:\n\n* **Comisiones de trading/swap**\n\nSon tarifas pagadas por quienes intercambian activos en un pool de liquidez (LP)\nEstas tarifas van a quienes proporcionan liquidez (tokens) a estos pooles.\n\nLos LPs obtienen su APR de:\n\n1. Inyección de recompensas (insostenible)\n2. Tarifas comerciales (reales)\n\nCuando el APR proviene de la porción de inyección de recompensas (excesiva emisión de tokens) estas se financian a través de la inflación simbólica y no son sostenibles. No hay ingresos externos que respalden estas recompensas.\n\nLas tarifas comerciales son ingresos reales. Los usuarios pagan una comisión por la utilización de los LPs. Uniswap es un ejemplo de esto, las recompensas no va a los tenedores del token $UNI, todo se distribuye a quienes aportan a los LP.\n\n* **Tarifas de protocolo** \n\nEstas son tarifas pagadas a un protocolo a cambio de brindar un servicio. Por ejemplo los bridges mueven fondos de una cadena a otra y cobran a los usuarios por este servicio.\n\n* **Interés por préstamo** \n\nLos intereses de los prestatarios también son ingresos reales, pero la mayor parte va a los prestamistas.  La ganancia real que el protocolo conserva y comparte con los poseedores de tokens se calcula: Interés de los prestatarios menos el interés pagado a los prestamistas.\n\nHasta acá ingresos reales, con los que se pagan los rendimientos a los inversores. Pero hay protocolos que usan otras estrategias más deficientes para ofrecer mejores ganancias.\n\nVeamos ejemplos de ingresos insostenibles.\n\n* **Yield farming incentivados en LP**\n\nLos yield farming son solo tokens que se imprimen y distribuyen a costa de la inflación. Las recompensas por la emisión de nuevos tokens no son un rendimiento \"real\". Potencialmente, puede ganar dinero de ellos mediante el farming y el dumping a corto plazo, pero no son fuentes de rendimiento reales o sostenibles.

{"id": "wNgr_gu1F5aanrW3cwBwO1hAg2EB7DWLBrB1O0MsVKs", "title": "Studying the Optimism Collective", "body": "![Optimism Collective Announcement](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*Hz5mYJLcQfRc9AlMuHB_TA.png)\n\n***Disclosure: You may already be a winner of the*** ***[$OP token sweepstakes](https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/check). I am serving as a delegate for the Optimism Token House.***\n\nThis week Optimism dropped the $OP token, initiating Optimism Governance. Optimism’s governance system presents an exciting opportunity to study the latest thinking in governance design and helps us focus on shaping the next era of Web3 through its focus on public goods. With the launch of the token, Optimism created the Optimism Collective, an ecosystem that will govern the distribution of public goods funding derived from the revenue the protocol generates. The Optimism Collective is governed by three bodies: the Token House (holders of $OP), the Citizens’ House (select NFT holders), and the Foundation. Optimism’s structure is notable for its balance of power between the three governing bodies, the use of multiple voting styles (token-weighted and one-person, one-vote), and the Collective’s commitment to experimentation.\n\n*What is Optimism?*\n\nOptimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is an optimistic rollup: it is optimistic, because it assumes transactions submitted to it by users are valid; it is a rollup, because it sequences transactions off of Ethereum and periodically submits a merkle root of the transactions to Ethereum to create a resulting state change. Given that Optimism’s sequencer does not ensure the same security as Ethereum, Optimism creates a dispute period after its sequencer publishes a batch of transactions, during which a party can challenge a state change with a fault proof (for a reward) which will prevent the state change from being committed to Ethereum. Optimism is the first layer 2 to achieve EVM equivalence, meaning that there is no difference between how smart contracts are executed on L2 and L1, which makes deployment on Optimism easier.\n\n*The Optimism Collective — Mission*\n\nThe Optimism Collective is guided by a vision of “sustainably fund\\[ing\\] those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond.” In essence, Optimism is devoting protocol revenue tokenholders and trusted stewards of the community to fund public goods projects that create compounding value for Optimism and eventually Web3 and broader society. The Collective was created with a view toward making public goods creation profitable, meaning “impact=profit.” The Collective seeks to achieve its mission by funding public goods both proactively and retroactively. Proactive funding encourages innovation and risk-taking in the pursuit of public goods; retroactive funding ensures that impactful projects are rewarded.\n\n*Balance of Powers*\n\nOptimism seeks to balance the short-term and long-term views of the community by balancing power between the Token House, the Citizens’ House, and the Foundation.\n\n![Optimism Governance Overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*V9XR86iMDooYoZBg.jpeg)\n\nThe Token House is entrusted to make determinations about project incentives, protocol upgrades, and the appropriation of treasury funds to the Foundation. By leveraging the collective knowledge of the Token House, the Collective is able to improve the predictive power of its grants and adjust to the specific needs of the Optimism community. The democratic aspect of the Token House ensures that the users of the protocol have representation in determining the future of the protocol’s mission and function.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will focus on retroactive public goods funding. Citizens will be selected from the community; their citizenship is non-transferrable. By selecting individuals who have demonstrated value to the Optimism ecosystem, the Collective will increase the likelihood that retroactive funding represents true value provided to the community. Having a consistency of identity creates continuity in criteria and makes long-term decision-making possible.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is the steward of the Collective. It oversees the administration of governance, allocates treasury assets (including the distribution of $OP), vetoes malicious proposals, and has the power to amend the Constitution. The Foundation has many stabilizing powers for the community, yet its capabilities remain in check by the Token House. The Token House can remove directors from the Foundation and veto changes to the founding documents that would materially impair tokenholders’ rights.\n\n*Mixed Voting*\n\nThe Token House and Citizens’ House have different forms of voting to suit different functions. The Token House votes on a token-weighted basis. As in any token-weighted system, Token House voting is susceptible to plutocratic concentration of power and voter apathy. The Token House permits tokenholders to delegate their votes to stewards who have made public commitments to act as stewards for the Collective. Delegation may mitigate the power of individual holders who have high concentrations of power by enabling smaller holders to pool their votes through a delegate. Delegation also ensures that there are members of the community who are dedicated to participating in governance, mitigating the chance that small groups can collude to pass self-interested proposals with a quorum.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will operate through a one-person, one-vote system. Citizens are ultimately expected to be chosen through deliberation between the Token House and the Citizens’ House. Given that Citizens are chosen based on their specific insights, the one-person, one-vote structure is sensible: newly minted citizens will have equal footing with incumbents for decision-making.\n\nBringing a token-weighted system together with a one-person, one-vote system creates a balance between the short-term and the long-term as well as between the prospective and retroactive. Both Houses come together to determine the Optimism network parameters, which affects the balance between transaction volume on the Optimism network and funding supply for retroactive public goods funding. This balance keeps the present and future health of the protocol fairly represented: tokenholders are not unfairly called upon to subsidize large-scale infrastructural projects, while citizens have a voice in projecting long-term funding needs to improve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n*Experimentation*\n\nOptimism’s Working Constitution is brief, but the first principle is “a commitment to experimentation.” Projects that have a need for a complex beginning also have a need for flexibility. At the point of initiation, the Optimism community can only match an understanding of their needs with governance theory and the knowledge of how other DAOs have succeeded and failed. To ensure the success of the governance process, the community needs to commit to a flexible system in order to test theory with community-specific data. By focusing on experimentation, Optimism will collect important data on what principles and rules best suit the mission of funding public goods and use that data to create a better fit between the Collective’s mission and its procedure.\n\nEarly experimentation mitigates path-dependency. By maintaining a commitment to testing theories, the community encourages honesty about the value of the governance systems it tries. A collective mindset of flexibility also encourages the community to innovate, as the cost of failure is lowered and the value of the data collected is high.

I am serving as a delegate for the Optimism Token House.***\n\nThis week Optimism dropped the $OP token, initiating Optimism Governance. Optimism’s governance system presents an exciting opportunity to study the latest thinking in governance design and helps us focus on shaping the next era of Web3 through its focus on public goods. With the launch of the token, Optimism created the Optimism Collective, an ecosystem that will govern the distribution of public goods funding derived from the revenue the protocol generates. The Optimism Collective is governed by three bodies: the Token House (holders of $OP), the Citizens’ House (select NFT holders), and the Foundation. Optimism’s structure is notable for its balance of power between the three governing bodies, the use of multiple voting styles (token-weighted and one-person, one-vote), and the Collective’s commitment to experimentation.\n\n*What is Optimism?*\n\nOptimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is an optimistic rollup: it is optimistic, because it assumes transactions submitted to it by users are valid; it is a rollup, because it sequences transactions off of Ethereum and periodically submits a merkle root of the transactions to Ethereum to create a resulting state change. Given that Optimism’s sequencer does not ensure the same security as Ethereum, Optimism creates a dispute period after its sequencer publishes a batch of transactions, during which a party can challenge a state change with a fault proof (for a reward) which will prevent the state change from being committed to Ethereum. Optimism is the first layer 2 to achieve EVM equivalence, meaning that there is no difference between how smart contracts are executed on L2 and L1, which makes deployment on Optimism easier.\n\n*The Optimism Collective — Mission*\n\nThe Optimism Collective is guided by a vision of “sustainably fund\\[ing\\] those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond.” In essence, Optimism is devoting protocol revenue tokenholders and trusted stewards of the community to fund public goods projects that create compounding value for Optimism and eventually Web3 and broader society. The Collective was created with a view toward making public goods creation profitable, meaning “impact=profit.” The Collective seeks to achieve its mission by funding public goods both proactively and retroactively. Proactive funding encourages innovation and risk-taking in the pursuit of public goods; retroactive funding ensures that impactful projects are rewarded.\n\n*Balance of Powers*\n\nOptimism seeks to balance the short-term and long-term views of the community by balancing power between the Token House, the Citizens’ House, and the Foundation.\n\n![Optimism Governance Overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*V9XR86iMDooYoZBg.jpeg)\n\nThe Token House is entrusted to make determinations about project incentives, protocol upgrades, and the appropriation of treasury funds to the Foundation. By leveraging the collective knowledge of the Token House, the Collective is able to improve the predictive power of its grants and adjust to the specific needs of the Optimism community. The democratic aspect of the Token House ensures that the users of the protocol have representation in determining the future of the protocol’s mission and function.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will focus on retroactive public goods funding. Citizens will be selected from the community; their citizenship is non-transferrable. By selecting individuals who have demonstrated value to the Optimism ecosystem, the Collective will increase the likelihood that retroactive funding represents true value provided to the community. Having a consistency of identity creates continuity in criteria and makes long-term decision-making possible.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is the steward of the Collective. It oversees the administration of governance, allocates treasury assets (including the distribution of $OP), vetoes malicious proposals, and has the power to amend the Constitution. The Foundation has many stabilizing powers for the community, yet its capabilities remain in check by the Token House. The Token House can remove directors from the Foundation and veto changes to the founding documents that would materially impair tokenholders’ rights.\n\n*Mixed Voting*\n\nThe Token House and Citizens’ House have different forms of voting to suit different functions. The Token House votes on a token-weighted basis. As in any token-weighted system, Token House voting is susceptible to plutocratic concentration of power and voter apathy. The Token House permits tokenholders to delegate their votes to stewards who have made public commitments to act as stewards for the Collective. Delegation may mitigate the power of individual holders who have high concentrations of power by enabling smaller holders to pool their votes through a delegate. Delegation also ensures that there are members of the community who are dedicated to participating in governance, mitigating the chance that small groups can collude to pass self-interested proposals with a quorum.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will operate through a one-person, one-vote system. Citizens are ultimately expected to be chosen through deliberation between the Token House and the Citizens’ House. Given that Citizens are chosen based on their specific insights, the one-person, one-vote structure is sensible: newly minted citizens will have equal footing with incumbents for decision-making.\n\nBringing a token-weighted system together with a one-person, one-vote system creates a balance between the short-term and the long-term as well as between the prospective and retroactive. Both Houses come together to determine the Optimism network parameters, which affects the balance between transaction volume on the Optimism network and funding supply for retroactive public goods funding. This balance keeps the present and future health of the protocol fairly represented: tokenholders are not unfairly called upon to subsidize large-scale infrastructural projects, while citizens have a voice in projecting long-term funding needs to improve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n*Experimentation*\n\nOptimism’s Working Constitution is brief, but the first principle is “a commitment to experimentation.” Projects that have a need for a complex beginning also have a need for flexibility. At the point of initiation, the Optimism community can only match an understanding of their needs with governance theory and the knowledge of how other DAOs have succeeded and failed. To ensure the success of the governance process, the community needs to commit to a flexible system in order to test theory with community-specific data. By focusing on experimentation, Optimism will collect important data on what principles and rules best suit the mission of funding public goods and use that data to create a better fit between the Collective’s mission and its procedure.\n\nEarly experimentation mitigates path-dependency. By maintaining a commitment to testing theories, the community encourages honesty about the value of the governance systems it tries. A collective mindset of flexibility also encourages the community to innovate, as the cost of failure is lowered and the value of the data collected is high. If early rules are rigid, systems may proceed despite inefficiencies and flaws in the early design, and the longer the flaws linger, the more difficult it becomes to remedy them in the future.\n\nThe results of the Collective’s experiments will be public goods in themselves.

Of nothingness. Of worthlessness. Of watching my love reject me again with a smile and a dance.\n\nIt’s not just a rejection of *oh we’re just not good together.* It’s deeper. Rejection to the core.

{"id": "CjGLCh_MDJbqrPWab5LXaiUtzmFPsRlV23nuyKhLjzI", "title": "Tokenomics | Part 1", "body": "## What are Tokenomics? \n\nTokenomics can be described as the economics of how cryptocurrencies work, just like banks & governments have monetary policy to control fiat currencies (currencies issued by governments that aren’t backed by any commodity such as gold or silver), crypto has tokenomics which anyone is able to view in order to guess if the token has any chance to succeed.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1nhb_lZdwXid_F1liYxsm.jpeg?height=2111&width=1813)\n\n## Why \n\nWhy is it important to know about tokenomics… Well, most of the time it’s a good idea to know you want to understand where your hard-earned money is going, how it will be used and how the processes operate, just like if you order food at a restaurant you like to see the menu and what goes into the meal.\n\nUnless you’re a full degen and choose to ape in or YOLO all your money into the next hyped shit coin, pump & dump, blatant ponzi schemes or pensions funds managed by someone who care more about their fees than your portfolio. 👀\n\nThis is why you might hear people say things like “So what’s the tokenomics, the supply, market cap, ect.“ when talking about new tokens or/and projects and that makes sense, you should know what ~~you’re throwing your money at~~ investing in.\n\nIMO some good basic questions to ask are:\n\n* How many coins exist?\n* How many coins will be added (how & when)?\n* Is the supply inflationary (increasing) or deflationary (decreasing)?\n* wHaT iS tHe uTiLiTy, which is a very sensible an fair question, for example, can they be used for more than just trading or can they be staked, ect.?\n* Is there a real-world use case?\n* Who are the whales (who owns the majority of tokens)?\n* Is the distribution spread out or concentrated?\n\nThis is just them asking how it works, so they can figure out if it’s a project that they see as valuable for the short term or/and long term - There’s quite a bit to unwrap so I’ll try to explain it as best as I can.\n\n## With those questions in mind, I’ll focus on x6 areas:\n\n* Supply\n* Demand\n* Distribution & Allocation\n* Market Cap\n* Deflationary vs. Inflationary\n* ROI (Return on interest)\n* Roadmap\n* Where are the builders\n\n## Supply\n\nThis just means that how many tokens there are in total.\n\n* Circulating: How many tokens are currently available or/and in use. A slow & steady increase of the circulating supply can be positive, meaning there is active mining hence activity in the project, so you could expect the token value to increase. However if too many tokens are released quickly or/and too often, then that could effect the price negatively.\n* Total: Circulating tokens minus burned tokens (tokens that are permanently removed from circulation by being sent to a wallet address that can’t be accessed, so those tokens are lost).\n* Maximum: The total number of tokens that can ever be produced, some tokens have a max supply such as BTC whereas others don’t have a max supply like ETH.\n\n## Demand\n\nThis means how many people want the token.\n\n* Simple supply & demand, if there is a high demand for the token but a small supply then it’s logical to assume the price would rise. Vice versa, if there is too much supply and not enough demand then the price may fall.\n\n## Distribution & Allocation\n\nHow the token is shared and the spread out amongst the holders. It’s important to make sure that the tokens distributed fairly and that the holders don’t have a large percentage or it could be a sign of whales who could easily manipulate the market and cause pump & dump scenarios.\n\n* Pre-mined: A select group are granted tokens before they’re offered to the public on public sale, these groups can be the developers, team, private investors & VC’s.\n* Fair launch: Everyone has access to the tokens at the same time/price.\n\n## Market Cap\n\nCan be used to indicated token value, popularity & size of the token.\n\n* Current price x circulating supply = Market cap\n* High market cap but low circulating supply has potential to increase over time.\n\n## Deflationary vs. Inflationary\n\nThis means is the token gaining or loosing value. Can be used to indicated token value, popularity & size of the token.\n\n* Deflationary: Has a maximum supply, for example with BTC there is a max limit of 21 million BTC that can be mined & brought into circulation.\n* Inflationary: No maximum supply, such as Dogecoin.\n\n## ROI (Return on interest)\n\nHow much cashflow or income a token can create\n\n* This can be done in different ways, which includes staking, liquidity pools, being a validator for the network, etc.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThis is a plan for the project, it can come as a pitchdeck or whitepaper, ect.\n\n* Addressing current challenges and anticipating future challenges, do they already have solutions and/or are they currently working on solutions?\n\n## Where are the builders\n\nBasically, is the project growing, plateauing or shrinking.\n\n* Does the project or ecosystem have a lot of activity from people working in the space to build, develop and/or grow. If there are, you can assume that’s a positive sign for the project to improve *(& hopefully the price to follow)*.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wcOjh9wYcKJZUUkT8RIii.png?height=1450&width=1446)\n\nI hope that made sense and was clear, or at least gave you a slightly better idea of what tokenomics are, hopefully, you can use your newfound knowledge to research & avoid YOLO’ing all of your savings into the next x1000 token that you found on reddit …\n\nNext, we’ll check out & compare the tokenomics of BTC & ETH.", "timestamp": 1654276581, "digest": "dg3o4792yl-KVtHuUIiTbPmsGfoN4JJz967oHXyI5k4", "contributor": "0xd40C1F4242D17023Fa4894812Ee7563124b27C66"}

{"id": "ZnzuFm1dy84Ua4DjqhDtxPKexwQUUgnOsmCDgHaI2C8", "title": "The Efficacy of YouTube in Autodidactic 10th Grade ELA Instruction\n", "body": "The purpose of this study was to examine students' attitudes and abilities to teach themselves academic content using YouTube in a 10th Grade English Language Arts classroom. It was conducted over a course of four-weeks and analyzed quantitative data in the form of a survey and test scores to test the efficacy of YouTube in a formal learning environment. The demographic makeup of this study consisted of twenty-seven participants from a highly-diverse and urban Title 1 school. \n\nThis study found that students’ attitudes towards YouTube may not determine their ability to use it for learning successfully in the classroom and that YouTube could be equally as effective as teacher lecture in delivering standards-based instruction. For this reason, the lecture-test model in education should be heavily scrutinized as it does not utilize 21st Century technology to its full advantage. Educators should focus their classroom on media literacy (finding credible sources online, utilizing new technologies, and teaching oneself using the Internet) as students will need to be lifelong learners to remain competitive in the future economy. It is recommended that future research test the efficacy of emerging technologies in the classroom.** \n **\n\n**Chapter 1**\n\nStatement of the Problem\n\nThe advent of YouTube was revolutionary for mankind and its popularization could potentially change the face of education, forever, “students can potentially download and stream media wherever and whenever they like, affording great flexibility in learning experiences, and potentially de-tether learning from the bricks and mortar university classroom” (Thomson, Bridgestock, Willems, 2014).  Colleges have increasingly embraced online/distance learning and reaped the financial and logistical benefits of its approach. What effects of this paradigm shift will trickle down to high school ELA instruction? This must be examined, as it is imperative that secondary school curriculum  promote media literacy in preparation for further education (McLoughlin & Lee, 2010). Retention and persistence in online courses is an issue in higher education because students must self-motivate and self-educate (Douglas, 2010). For this reason, using online sources, such as YouTube, to teach oneself has become an essential skill in collegiate online learning and should be taught early in a student’s career.\n\nThe future economy will be highly automated and technologically driven; it is estimated that sixty-five percent of present K-12 students will work jobs that do not exist yet (“The Future of Jobs”, 2016, p. 3).  In order to stay competitive in an automated and globalized economy, it will be necessary for students to teach themselves new concepts and adapt to new environments as they become obsolete . Educators should redirect their curriculum to reflect this reality by preparing students for lifelong learning outside of academia through integrating technology into the classroom (McLoughlin & Lee, 2010, p. 38).  YouTube is a possible means to meet such cyclical demands as it is low-cost, exhaustive, and easy-to-use.  \n\n Educators should integrate emerging technologies which prove more cost-effective, relevant, and efficient than traditional methods into their instruction with the intention of decreasing cost of services and increasing student engagement. Although not in the interest of career educators or educational institutions, this should be a goal of a democratic and equitable society-- where all people, regardless of income, are able to receive a high-quality education for little to no cost. \n\n**Purpose of the Study**\n\nAuto-didacticism through YouTube is happening all across the world, but its efficacy has only been briefly studied. It is possible that people could become well-versed in a subject using YouTube alone, completely outside of an educational institution. \n\nNew technologies are transforming the way people learn. Online learning has become very popular in higher education and is slowly finding its way into high school curriculums. In online learning situations, YouTube videos are often utilized to supplement or replace teacher lecture. Teachers use it because it is accessible, free, current, and if the source is credible, reliable, and students love the platform because it gives them autonomy, diverse perspectives, and the ability to engage on their own schedule.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine students' attitudes and ability to teach themselves difficult concepts through YouTube, and test the efficacy of their approach. This study will explore how students discover information with this democratic, omnipresent, and easily accessible medium.\n\n**Significance of the Study**\n\nSelf-directed online learning requires little resources: anyone with a device connected to the Internet has the ability to educate themselves. It is possible that someone in a Third World country with access to the Internet could access a high-quality education for practically free. Autodidacticism through YouTube could be used as a means to advance one’s career or self-pursuits after graduation, regardless of socioeconomic status. This is a revolutionary concept. \n\nThe sheer amount of information published on the web is enormous. Gonzalez (2004), as cited in Seimens (2005), explains, “the amount of knowledge in the world has doubled in the past 10 years and is doubling every 18 months.” Human advancements in knowledge, about practically everything, is an overwhelming behemoth (Garrett-Wright, Abell, 2011). It is humanly impossible for educators to teach their students everything, and YouTube is an outlet for both parties to stay informed on emerging information. \n\n**Theoretical/Conceptual Framework**\n\nThis study is built mainly upon Connectivism, which states that access to information is more important than the information itself, and that “real-life learning is messy and complex” (Siemens, 2005, p. 5).  Connectivism builds upon on the idea that the Internet can be utilized to share knowledge and that people learn by building upon their prior knowledge in sometimes non-linear ways. \n\nBandura’s (1977) Social Learning Theory is a theory that states that people learn from observing others and replicating their behaviors. Effective modeling and reproduction by the viewer is a method in which humans learn.  Reproducing what has been modeled is inextricable aspect of the human experience. People can learn by watching others perform tasks on YouTube.\n\nBruner’s (1961) Discovery Learning Theory holds the idea that people learn best by discovering information themselves. When humans are given a problem and asked to solve it, humans rise to the occasion by exploring possibilities, wrestling difficult concepts, and arriving at conclusions. The discovery learning process allows for mistakes and insufficiencies because overcoming obstacles leads to increased motivation, creativity, and learning. Students teaching themselves through YouTube could potentially be more effective than a teacher leading students through a prescribed curriculum. \n\n**Research Questions**\n\nThe following questions were examined in this study: \n\n1\\.) Is there a positive correlation between a student’s confidence level in self-guided online learning and their use of YouTube to master a specific-skill (i.e. grammar usage/mechanics) in 10th grade ELA instruction?\n\n2\\.) How proficient are 10th grade students, on a skill-based assessment, at self-educating via YouTube versus traditional instruction?\n\n**Hypotheses**\n\nIt is hypothesized that students will value flexibility in their learning and feel alienated by the current high school educational system and traditional “sage on a stage” student-teacher relationships (Prensky, 2008). They appreciate the freedom in a “go figure it out” approach and find this learning process relevant to their daily lives. Teaching themselves feels natural because Generation Z teachers themselves with technology outside of school. It is also hypothesized that the majority of  students will be able to teach themselves grammar usage and mechanics with YouTube effectively, regardless of proclaimed confidence level. \n\n**Delimitations**\n\nThis study tested a small sample size, and was reflective of a very specific diverse Title 1 student body. Not all students in this study had cell phones or immediate access to the Internet at home due to cultural or financial limitations. It is plausible that these students do not interact with technology in the same manner that those who do always have access. Students may encounter difficulties and not persevere, because they have been taught how to use technology for academic purposes.\n\nLiterature Search Procedures\n\nUsing Google Trends, this researcher searched for “YouTube how to” to analyze if people were interested in using YouTube to teach themselves. The results yielded a steady increase in interest in teaching oneself via YouTube over the course of around twelve years and, as Figure 1 indicates, an extremely high interest (almost 100%) since 2012.\n\nMark Prensky’s, a leader and visionary in technology in education, research was heavily examined for this study. He coined the terms, “digital natives” and “digital immigrants” (Prensky, 2001, p. 1), which will referenced throughout this study. His work begs educators to adapt to the modern world through the use of technology.\n\nArticles from JStor were found regarding the effects of technology on psychology and the brain.  ProQuest was used to find dissertations, which were very specific and relevant to this topic. A simple Google search for credible, academic writing on this issue proved highly effective as well.\n\n**Definition of Terms**\n\nThe following terms will be used in the present action research study:\n\n*ELA:* English Language Arts\n\n*Autodidacticism:* Self-directed online learning \n\n*Digital Native:* a person who has been connected to the Internet for the entirety of their life  (Prensky, 2001, p. 1).\n\n*Digital Immigrant:* a person who lived in the era before personal computing. This person knows “about” technology, but is not fully immersed in its domain (Prensky, 2001, p. 2). \n\n***Chapter 2*** \n\n**Findings from Literature Review**\n\nYouTube is a major player in the Information Age. It has billions of users (Bloom & Johnston, 2010, p. 113), accounts for hundreds of millions of hours of watch time and billions of views each day, has local versions in 76 different languages, and covers 95% of the world’s population. The average time spent on YouTube is forty minutes, and the average amount of video posted to YouTube per minute is 300 hours (“YouTube Statistics,” 2016). With this daily exponential expansion, it is possible that YouTube could become an essential part of the educational system (Fleck, Beckman, Sterns, & Hussey, 2014, p. 23). \n\n**Live vs. Online Instruction**\n\nFiglio, Rush, & Yin (2010) were the self-proclaimed first group to study the efficacy of online instruction versus live instruction. They found that live instruction showed a modest,  almost negligible, increase in learning on a standardized tests. However, the researchers did find a discrepancy in participants whom were Hispanic, male, and low-achieving. Figlio, Rush, & Yin (2010), concluded that online instruction may prove effective for traditional students; however, “students from different language backgrounds, experience or motivation levels might have different experiences in live versus Internet only settings” (p.13).\n\nIn a later study, Driscoll, Jícha, Hunt, Tichavsky, & Gretchen (2012) studied satisfaction and success in a university level Sociology course in online versus F2F (face-to-face) scenarios.  The professor taught the exact same material online and in a traditional classroom. The researchers found similar results to that of  Figlio, Rush, & Yin (2010) stating that, online education is only effective when designed correctly (Driscoll et. al., 2012, 323).  When it came to satisfaction, they found that students found each learning online or in a classroom was equally satisfactory. Their consensus, congruent with other studies they reviewed, was that there is no difference in the efficacy of online or classroom learning (p.325). \n\n**Persistence and Autodidactic Online Learning**\n\nSuccessful self-directed learning requires two key elements in order to be successful: an instructional method process and the responsibility and personality of the learner (Svedberg, 2010). Persistence and tenacity is an integral part of autodidacticism, especially in online distance learning. The dropout rates are higher in online programs as opposed to traditional classroom programs (Douglas, 2010). \n\nA measurement tool exists for self-directed learning “readiness,” Guglielmino’s (1978) Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale.  In Svedberg’s (2010) study, students were measured with this scale. The vast majority of students were labeled as “persisters” as opposed to “non-persisters.” However, the results of the study found that students labeled “non-persistent” actually scored higher on an assessment, which befuddled the researcher and contradicted popular learning theories outlined in Svedberg’s dissertation (p.44). \n\nDouglas (2010) also studied persistence in self-directed online learning. His study focused on the correlation of students’ persistence amongst perceived barriers of success in online learning for adults. Similarly to Svedberg (2010), Douglas did not find a correlation between perceived barriers in self-directed learning and participants’ decisions to participate in self-directed learning. Adults were motivated to learn in online environments regardless of their personal situations.  In fact, there was an overwhelming amount of interest amongst adults in autodidactic online learning environments; 84 percent of adults surveyed said that they wished to self-educate online (p. 92). \n\n**Technology and the Brain**\n\nGreenfeld (2016) studied how emerging technologies affect digital natives’ brains. Greenfeld found that Millennials process information differently than their predecessors. Since information is readily available at all times through the Internet; rote memorization is becoming increasingly unnecessary. Greenfeld concludes that technology, “reduces our motivation to acquire new knowledge that dwells in our heads” and that, “parents and teachers need strategies to educate a generation that increasingly believes all relevant knowledge resides online” (p. 342).  \n\nFisher, Goddu, & Keil (2015) studied a person’s ability to use the Internet and their confidence level in answering general knowledge questions. Participants were asked simple questions like, “Why are there leap years?” and “Why are there more women than men?”  When given access to a search engine, the researchers found an increase in participants confidence levels when given access to a search engine, even if their searches were insufficient.  The researchers explained a “transactive” memory exchange with the Internet. Since human memory is highly fallible, humans have began to refer to search engines and, the Internet in general, to access knowledge. However, the participants had an inflated sense of what they knew and displayed an overconfidence in answering questions. \n\n**Millennial Attitudes towards YouTube**\n\nFleck, Beckman, Sterns, & Hussey (2014) studied effective ways to use YouTube in a college-level psychology course.  Their study utilized high-interest and entertaining, yet relevant, YouTube videos in order to teach content.  Their selection included videos from popular culture i.e. Pirates of the Caribbean and Big Bang Theory. When surveyed before the experiment, 80 percent of students said that they found they videos helpful in an academic setting.  In a post-experiment survey, 97.3 percent of students felt that the YouTube videos were useful and aided in learning. There was a positive correlation with students’ attitudes towards YouTube after they experienced how YouTube could be used positively in the curriculum. The study concluded that there were two elements in which the students found most helpful: entertainment and correlation to the curriculum. \n\n**Baby Boomers Attitudes towards YouTube**\n\nThomson, Bridgstock, and Willems (2014) studied the generational attitudes between Baby Boomers and Millennials about using video in the classroom. Baby Boomers, who teach Millennials, may see emerging technology as a distraction and detractor from education, while Millennials see it as a viable means of credible information (Garrett-Wright & Abbell, 2011). This generational divide is a source of friction in the classroom. Attitudes towards emerging technologies heavily affects how teachers use video in the classroom and its efficacy. When veteran teachers create videos, they tend to make them in an online lecture format. However, this is not the most effective way to exploit the medium of video (Thomson, Bridgstock, Willems, 2014).  There is a disconnect between how Baby Boomers and Millennials consume technology, and this may lead to conflicting views on the role of technology in the classroom, and consequently, how to use it in an effective way.  The content within the video must be relevant to the course and the student’s interest (Thomson, Bridgstock, Willems, 2014), (Fleck, Beckman, Sterns, & Hussey, 2014, p. 23). When Baby Boomers are unable to meet these needs through video, their skepticism is confirmed. However, this is not a problem with the student, but rather with the teacher because developing quality videos requires a skill set which often times Baby Boomers do not have (Thomson, Bridgstock, Willems, 2014, p.76).\n\n**Conclusions** \n\nAcademics overwhelming agree on one thing: not enough academic research exists on YouTube or video as a viable means of disseminating information in the classroom (Garrett-Wright & Abbell, 2011); (Thomson, Bridgstock, Willems, 2014); (Greenfeld, 2016); (Svedberg, 2010).  Researchers, academics, and educators realize that education is incongruent with future lifestyles and economy (Bloom & Johnston, 2010).  The process of redefining a modern education exemplar requires cross-generational understanding, feedback, and integration (Garrett-Wright & Abbell, 2011).  There is a technological rift that exists between those who grew up with technology in their households (digital natives) and those which learned to adapt (digital immigrants) (Prensky, 2001), and YouTube may be a tool to mend this schism in the classroom. YouTube is easy to use, ubiquitous, and free (Garrett-Wright & Abbell, 2011).  It is possible that entire courses will one day be based entirely around YouTube, which could make the generational divide in teaching irrelevant. \n\n**Implications for Future Research**\n\nEducators must reconcile traditional pedagogy and modern society. Future research should scrutinize the lecture-test model in education and examine the role of the teacher in the classroom as emerging technologies that may be more cost-effective, relevant, and efficient than traditional education are introduced. \n\nThe efficacy of self-directed online learning is difficult to measure in an online setting. Svedberg’s (2010) studied yielded contradictory results than pontificated: there may not be a correlation between self-motivation and self-directed online learning efficacy. A difficulty cited was the hurdle of getting honest and thoughtful feedback from participants, especially those considered “non-persisters”. Svedberg (2010) also believes that “reading avidity, GPA, how a student connects to the Internet, and work obligations should also be considered in future studies.  Douglas (2010) states that his study could have been improved by taking a larger and truly random sample rather than examining a specific population. \n\nResearchers should examine the use of YouTube in everyday life rather than isolated controlled settings. In a controlled setting YouTube may prove to be highly effective. However, in everyday situations, as Greenfeld (2015) postulates, YouTube may prove to be just another distraction.  Researchers should understand that there is a difference of how students interact with technology in a formal experimental setting rather than browsing at home, where there are an infinite amount of distractions. In order to account for this, researchers could possibly let students multitask while they conduct an experiment to simulate a realistic setting. Or, researchers could use an informal setting while conducting an experiment to extrapolate more convincing results. \n\n**Chapter 3**\n\n**Research Design**\n\nThe design of this research was experimental. Both classes were taught the same topic but were delivered content differently. Students were given three pre/post tests over a span of four weeks.The order of the research experiment was as followed:\n\n1. Students were given an attitudes survey regarding their use of YouTube.\n2. A pretest was administered.    \n3.  Instruction lasted around twenty minutes. The control group received instruction by teacher lecture and the experimental group was given a YouTube playlist to view at their leisure. Instruction in the control group was traditional teacher lecture, whereas the experimental group received instruction by watching YouTube videos in playlists curated by the teacher. In the control group, students were lectured with a PowerPoint presentation\n4. A worksheet was given to students for practice. \n5. A posttest was administered. \n\n Only quantitative data was collected for this experiment because qualitative data was not necessarily relevant to the tested outcomes. The independent variable for this experiment was the method of delivery and the dependent variable was student growth by percentage points.\n\n**Sampling**                                                                                                                                      \n\nThe sample was not random; the classes were based upon scheduling by the school’s administration. Both the control and experiment groups were English II Standard classes of comparable ability level. \n\n**Participants**\n\nThis research was conducted at a Title 1 school in Middle Tennessee. The participants of this study consisted of a highly diverse student body, many of whom were bilingual. There were twenty-two students total. Four students spoke Arabic and fourteen spoke Spanish. There were also two black students and two Asian students.  Four students were enrolled in ELL programs, and one student had an IEP.  Nineteen of these students were in 10th grade and three were registered 12th graders. \n\nThe experimental group consisted of seventeen students.  The majority of students were also bilingual. The class consisted of four Arabic speakers, nine Spanish speakers, three black students and one white student.  Eight students were enrolled in an ELL program and one had an IEP.  Thirteen of the students were in 10th grade and four were registered 12th graders. \n\n**Data Collection**\n\nThe research used an experimental approach of collecting data. Quantitative data was measured to answer the following questions: \n\n1\\.) Is there a positive correlation between a student’s confidence level in self-guided online learning and successful use of YouTube to master a specific-skill (i.e. grammar usage/mechanics) in 10th grade ELA instruction?\n\n2\\.) How proficient are 10th grade students at self-educating, on a skill-based assessment, via YouTube?\n\n**Apparatus or Instruments**\n\nStudents in both the control and experimental group were administered pre/post tests with Kahoot at the end of each class session. Kahoot has been used several times in the classroom before and was familiar to the students. Kahoot was used for ease of use and reliability in data collection. Students used their cell phones or school issued computers to complete the tests.\n\nA survey was given on Google Forms using a Likert scale (1-5) to test students attitudes towards self-directed learning and YouTube before the experiment began. The questions consisted of how comfortable students were with YouTube, teaching themselves, and their attitudes towards utilizing YouTube in a classroom setting. \n\n**Data Analysis**\n\nData was collected in order to test the effectiveness of YouTube as an instructional method in the classroom. The researcher collected and analyzed students’ attitudes towards using YouTube and compared their responses with their average scores on posttests.  Posttest data was also used to compare the efficacy of YouTube in autodidactic instruction to traditional lecture in a 10th grade ELA classroom.\n\n**Ethical Behavior**\n\nThis researcher conducted an ethical study. Parents were given letters of consent forms at the beginning of the study, which were signed and returned to the researcher before any research data was collected. This study did not interfere with the curriculum in any way. All personal information from students was anonymized by assigning students’ names to numerical digits.  The data was kept securely by the researcher.  The school district and name of the school did not appear in any presentation or publication of data. This researcher also realizes that limitations in this study do exist, meaning that it may not be generalized to other populations. \n\n**Chapter 4**\n\n**Pre-Instruction Assessment**\n\nAn attitudes survey was given to all 27 students who participated in the study to determine how students interacted with YouTube. This survey quantified student comfortability levels with the medium, usage amount, general attitudes, and their preferred teaching model \n\n(YouTube vs. lecture vs. hybrid). The researcher did not want to make any assumptions about how students used the platform and was interested in getting a general idea of how students used YouTube, and if they felt it could be used in an academic context. \n\nFigure 3 indicates that the majority of students were “very comfortable” and confident in their ability to teach themselves using YouTube. Zero percent of students responded that they were “not comfortable” whereas forty-eight percent were “very comfortable.” Only three students (eleven percent) noted that they were less than comfortable.  \n\nThere is a correlation between students’ comfortability levels and usage. For example, forty-eight percent were daily users and forty-eight percent of students were “very comfortable.” Eleven percent of students reported being less than comfortable and eleven percent of students used it once a week. \n\nFigure 4. Students’ Preferences for Methods of Instruction. \n\n \n\nFigure 4 indicates the majority of students prefered a hybrid teaching method; Fifty-nine percent of students gravitated towards a mixture of lecture and teaching themselves. \n\nFigure 5. Student Attitudes Towards Using YouTube in the Classroom.\n\nFigure 5 shows that the vast majority (eighty-five percent) of students found YouTube to be a useful tool in the classroom. \n\n** \n Post-Instruction Results**\n\nFigure 6. Percentage Increase after Instruction Intervention.\n\nFigure 6 compares the increase in scores between the pretest and the posttest with the Lecture (control) and YouTube (experimental) group for three different lessons (MLA format, comma/semicolon usage, and parallel structure). There was a +13.79% difference in the control group lecture with MLA format. However, there was a -.98% difference in identifying needs for commas or semicolons and -.48% differences in parallel structure. \n\nFigure 7. Correlation Between Average Score and Reported Comfortability Levels. \n\nFigure 7 shows the comfortability rating students indicated on a pre-study survey versus the average score they received on three tests. The average score of students who responded a comfortability level of “2” scored, on average, 70%, “3’ scored 88.3%, “4,” 71.4%, and “5,” 62%. A higher report in comfortability level did not result in a higher score. In fact, those who marked a level of “3” scored better than those, on average, who marked a “5.”\n\n**Chapter 5**\n\n Discussion, Conclusions, and Recommendations\n\n**Summary of the Study**\n\nThis study seeked to test the efficacy of autodidactism in 10th grade in English Language Arts (ELA) instruction and examine students’ attitudes towards using YouTube for learning in the classroom. Twenty-seven students in two different ELA classes participated in a four-week long study. The students took a pre-study survey for the researcher to better understand how students used YouTube in their daily lives and how they felt about using YouTube for learning. Each class took part in three sessions on different aspects of the 10th grade ELA curriculum. \n\nThe three sessions were intensive and required full attention from the students. For the most part, students took the experiment very seriously and answered questions to their best ability. In general, the sessions lasted a little over an hour and consisted of a pre-test, instruction (lecture or YouTube), and a post-test. In the lecture session, students were administered instruction by a slide show presentation and in the YouTube session, students were given a YouTube playlist curated by the researcher. After each session, students were given a worksheet to complete before the posttest. \n\n**Interpretation of Results**\n\nThe results of this study indicate that YouTube may be a viable tool in this classroom. High school students gravitate towards the resource and they use it in their daily lives. Students are comfortable with using YouTube and also feel that it is a useful tool in learning. As this study indicates, autodidacticism with YouTube produced comparable results with teacher lecture in two out of three sessions. In the MLA session, there was a stark increase of 13.79%. A possible explanation for why this occurred is because the questions were mostly qualitative. The questions were not grammatical, they rather asked specific questions about the conventions of MLA format. The researcher may have “taught to the test,” giving the control group an advantage over the experimental group, which was not the intention of the researcher. \n\n**Links to Literature Review**\n\nThomson, Bridgstock & Willems (2014) postulate that the ability to stream content allows students to circumvent the brick and mortar classroom. This reality has massive implications on the future of education and its business model; a school building is unnecessary for learning.  For this reason, McLoughlin & Lee (2010) believe that educators should focus their curriculum on teaching students media literacy: how to find credible sources online, utilize new technologies, and teach themselves using the Internet.\n\nFiglio, Rush, & Yin (2010), concluded that online instruction may prove effective for traditional students, however, students from lower socioeconomic classes may have difficulty using technology for learning. The researcher’s study would need to be compared with similar studies to test the validity of this statement, but this researcher found that their Title 1 students had little difficulty using teaching themselves using YouTube. In congruence with the conclusions of  Driscoll et. al. (2012, p. 323), this researchers also found the efficacy of self-directed learning compared to teacher lecture were similar. In regards to increases in test score, there is no advantage in teacher lecture as a means to disseminate information. \n\nIn line with Douglas (2010) and Svedberg (2010), this researcher found no correlation in students’ perceived confidence and their ability to self-educate. Their attitude towards autodidacticism was, for the most part, irrelevant. In fact, Svedberg’s (2010) study found that students that labeled themselves as “non-persisters” actually scored better on assessments than those who were “persisters”. This study echoed that notion; students who marked “3” on a confidence level measure scored scored much higher those who labeled themselves a  “5.”\n\n**Limitations** \n\nLimitations related to the findings were that the technology used in this study was temperamental. At times, computers froze or locked students out from logging in to the computer. Students may have been frustrated with the technology that was available to them for this reason, resulting in a lower test score. Another limitation related to this study were time restraints. The researcher wanted to perform more sessions with students but was unable to due to block scheduling, other classroom responsibilities, Spring Break, and school closings due to weather.  Continuous sessions may have produced different results as students would be familiar with the format of the experiment and have scored better as a result. \n\n**Conclusions**\n\nAfter analyzing quantitative data, this researcher has concluded that YouTube may be an effective tool in the classroom. In some cases, YouTube is equally, or more, effective than teacher lecture.  The researcher also found that students’ reported comfortability levels with YouTube may not indicate better scores on post-tests. \n\nWhile compiling the playlists used for this study, this researcher found that some YouTube videos explained difficult concepts excellently.  Fleck, Beckman, Sterns & Hussey (2014) discuss the advantages of using videos over teacher lecture in the classroom because videos are not bound by time, location, student or teacher mood, etc. YouTube is a massive library of videos created by experts in their field, and as new content is uploaded regularly, a place for breaking stories in every field. Overall, it is a dynamic tool that has many advantages over teacher lecture and is only getting better and more capable with time. \n\nAll teachers can find useful content on YouTube and few reasons exist to not to use it in the classroom. Educators in every field should consider uploading videos of their own to add content to the already deep breadth of knowledge. A technological future is a reality that must be embraced by educators. Teaching static information in a textbook is losing relevancy, and more dynamic means of disseminating information should be explored and utilized in the classroom to push Education into the 21st Century. \n\n**Recommendations**\n\nThe findings from this study suggest that YouTube is an asset in the classroom. Students may use this website for self-directed learning or as a supplement to classroom instruction. Teachers should teach students how to search for and locate credible sources or create playlists for their students to view. This could allow students to engage with instruction outside of the classroom.\n\n**Implications for Further Research** \n\nYouTube should be further studied in K-12 education to explore its applications in the classroom, in online environments, and in autodidactic learning. It is changing the way people consume information, but is often not recognized formally as a viable resource by academia. This researcher would like to see studies that lasted longer on the subject to further its efficacy.  Studies should be conducted with the consideration of having an online class built entirely around YouTube videos. If this is a reality, it would make the instruction aspect of education at no cost, which is a revolutionary concept. \n\nIn the future, students could theoretically “choose” their teacher. YouTube is a database of knowledge that is exponentially expanding. If a student does not understand their teacher, it could be utilized by students to get a different perspective or explanation, or it could be used in isolation for content delivery. Education should constantly strive to acknowledge tools that are free and readily available for academic and career advancement.\n\n**Action Plan**\n\nThis researcher will use YouTube more frequently in the classroom. Along with lecture, YouTube playlists will be created for students to review concepts, receive further instruction, or as a means to receive instruction in lieu of absenteeism. Videos will also be created by the researcher more frequently to use in the classroom in the place of lecture. Media literacy will be a focus; Students will be taught how to find credible videos and how to use them for academic purposes. The researcher will encourage autonomy by teaching students to use the site to further their academic, career, and personal pursuits. \n\n** \n [References](http://er.dut.ac.za/bitstream/handle/123456789/69/Siemens_2005_Connectivism_A_learning_theory_for_the_digital_age.pdf?sequence=1)**\n\nBandura, A.

That is very nice and compliments the piece. <3\n\n\n---\n\nThe \"Web 3 arbitrarily introduces scarcity to digital media\" critique seems to never go away and I think it is fundamentally flawed.\n\nDigital media has always been scarce, because there is a rights holder conferred by law unless that rights holder renounces those rights with a license.\n\nIn plain terms, this means that at least in the jurisdictions where I am able to comprehend twitter arguments, when you take a digital photograph or create a piece of digital art, the copyright of that art is automatically assigned to the creator. It is scarce. 1 of 1. In the case of infringement of your rights as copyright holder, [it can be advantageous to have formally registered the work](https://www.artbusiness.com/register_and_copyright_art_for_artists.html), however the fact remains that digital media is scarce at the point of creation.\n\nThat these critiques often come from corners who mistakenly characterize crypto as a fraudulent fiction is ironic, as the premise that the digital media we enjoy on previous internets is not scarcely owned by anyone is fictitious. No scarcity is being *imposed* on media, existing scarcity is being *surfaced* and experimented with.\n\nThis is the brilliance of the NFT experiment. NFTs represent an elegant proposal to attempt what I would describe as **feasible abundance**. I.e how can we make free media fair for the people creating it?\n\nDecades deep into the internet experiment we had not yet found a way to reconcile our desire to have as many people as possible enjoy media, while also making life financially feasible for the creators of that work. NFTs create games and value exchange around ownership and collection abstracted above access to the content itself, which ought to be available to everyone. As [Jacob.eth articulates](https://cryptomedia.wtf/), the experiment proposes that the more a work is freely available, shared and memed, the more valuable ownership of that work becomes. As such, it is almost impossible to find a piece of NFT art locked behind a token gated wall. In real terms, *meaningful scarcity* would mean withholding that access.\n\nThis premise also explains why many of the most celebrated early NFT auctions from within the Ethereum community were held to retroactively compensate popular memes, from [Nyan Cat](https://foundation.app/@NyanCat/foundation/219) to [Disaster Girl](https://foundation.app/@DisasterGirl/foundation/25046). The values put forward by many corners of the NFT community are that media ought to be freely available, and that free media ought to be valuable. Information is now free *and* expensive. To achieve both states to the satisfaction of all parties at this immature stage is a minor miracle and to be celebrated.\n\nThis accomplishment is made possible through experimentation with previously hidden dynamics, and foregrounding them can be startling to those who were not previously aware of their existence. I call this phenomenon **the shock of the nude**.\n\nMany critics of crypto and NFTs mistakenly suggest that crypto is introducing financialization, inequity or scarcity to our digital lives. This is false. Public blockchains, through making visible latent forces such as financing, unequal returns, or scarce and valuable ownership, are bringing long existing dynamics to the surface to be scrutinized. **These forces are not *new*, they are *nude*.**\n\nOur previous internet lives are financialized daily on interfaces most of us do not have access to. Web 2 has concentrated wealth and attention to a handful of players at the top (who often most dutifully serve the objectives and accept the universal terms of a handful of platforms), but few other than professional insiders *have seen* the full extent to which this is true.\n\nWhat often emerges on twitter is people with a casual, idealistic, fan-side relationship with media condescending those with a longstanding commitment and understanding of their respective industries. This gulf in knowledge becomes apparent when critics are invited to propose their own alternatives to the current state of the web for creators, with highly RTable but practically infeasible ideas ranging from [laborious illegible key exchanges on a private database](https://blog.mollywhite.net/digital-artists-post-bubble-hopes-for-nfts-dont-need-a-blockchain/) (i.e like a blockchain but way worse) to [vague allusions to revive failed state based internets from 50 years ago](https://reallifemag.com/reconnected/). These ideas sound nice to an equally inexperienced crowd, but are unserious and do not stand to help anyone but their authors. If only things were so easy!\n\nAn unsurprising byproduct of a web modeled to facilitate advertising, it is often quite difficult to discern between solid information and promotional misdirection on Web 2.  There is a significant discrepancy between the statistics the public has access to and the hard financial and industrial realities obscured by them.\n\nIn the arts, the followers and stream numbers we see are a very distorted indicator of how well the person in question is doing financially, and say little of how people actually make a living. Due to tired dynamics of self promotion and brand construction encouraged by web 2 platforms, there is little incentive for anyone to disclose that they are struggling or in a precarious position. Crypto’s public ledgers shatter illusions and hold potential of unveiling sobering truths. **Web 2 is the grift.** **Web 3 is a gift**. It is not morally sound to accept that many people are committing their 20s and 30s to participating in a fiction while silently struggling, adrift of access to good information.\n\nOnly once the warts-and-all truth is made visible do we have any hope of addressing how the world actually works. The shock of the nude may be a cold shower, but a dose of reality is far more useful to practicing artists or internet denizens than a fictitious understanding of  the web and creative industries. Access to more accurate information outside of the promotional mirage of likes and follows is an uncontroversial good for anyone aspiring to make a living.\n\nThat said, while public ledgers make it quite difficult for many to pretend that things are going better than they actually are, there is no shortage of illusion creation on public blockchains too. For a minority who have the means, it is possible to distort perceptions by illicitly pumping bags, making anonymous acquisitions and the like. **Public ledgers are no panacea**, however I find it far preferable that such coordinated distortions be legible and open to scrutiny. As discussed [in our podcast with Context.app](https://interdependence.fm/episodes/making-web3-human-legible-constructive-speculation-and-the-shock-of-the-nude-with-context), more tools are being built to make on-chain activity human legible.\n\nIt will become harder and harder over time to get away with as new forms of journalism are made possible through the ability to track foul play, even retroactively. As [Taylor Monahan recently suggested on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1532085029857284101?s=20&t=UeymocOPtyFVEUOwwmhR8A), so far often the best policing of foul play in crypto has come from within crypto itself, and that accountability will spread as more learn how to read on-chain activity.\n\nYou can follow me [@matdryhurst](http://twitter.com/matdryhurst) on twitter\n\nWe discuss matters like this with wonderful guests weekly [on the Interdependence podcast](https://interdependence.fm/)", "timestamp": 1654276758, "digest": "S-W2ZXRbrcy8bVGrKwMXSou63gWir7RJ9xs6wUn_h-0", "contributor": "0xddf29Ea907a415c9629Af3F43a9612Dec3fC481C"}

In January last year OpenAI announced [DALL·E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/), a transformer model capable of generating convincing artworks from textual descriptions. This was shortly followed by the release of [OpenAI CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) (Contrastive Language Image Pre-Training), a neural network trained on image/description pairs released for public testing.\n\nWhat followed was an explosion of experimentation beginning in Spring 2021, with artists such as (but not limited to) [Ryan Murdock](https://twitter.com/advadnoun) and [Rivers Have Wings](https://twitter.com/RiversHaveWings) releasing free and open tools for the public to play with generating artworks by connecting CLIPs capacity to discern textual prompts with open image generation techniques such as Taming Transformer’s [VQGAN](https://compvis.github.io/taming-transformers/), and OpenAI’s own novel [Guided Diffusion](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion) method.\n\nIn lay terms, to create artwork one types what one wants to see, and this combination of generator (Diffusion, VQGAN) and discriminator (CLIP) produces an image that satisfies a desired prompt. In Ryan Murdock’s Latent Visions discord group, the artist [Johannez](https://twitter.com/_johannezz) (who has been publishing artworks and tutorials around machine learning imagery and music online for years) coined the term “Promptism” for this astounding new capacity to conjure artworks from telling a neural network what one would like to see.\n\nWhile this development is but the latest advancement in a legacy of machine learning in art too long to do justice to in a blog post, this act of conjuring artworks from language *feels very very new*. Feeling is an important dimension to the act of creating an artwork, as while we have for some years had the capacity to generate art from the laborious process of training GANs, often waiting overnight for results that invite the observer to squint and imagine a future of abundant possibility, a perfect storm in the past 18 months has led to a present in which the promise of co-creation with a machine is realized. It *feels* like jamming, giving and receiving feedback while refining an idea with an inhuman collaborator, seamlessly *art-ing*. It intuitively *feels* like an art making tool.\n\nAnalogies are imperfect, but this resembles the leap from the early electronic music period of manually stitching together pieces of tape to collage together a composition to the introduction of the wired synthesizer studio, or Digital Audio Workstation. In the 20th century this progress in musical tools-at-hand took place over half a century. In contrast, this leap in machine learning generated imaging tools-at-hand has gathered steam over a 3-5 year period.\n\nThis dizzying pace of development encourages reflection!\n\n### Reflections\n\nSince Alexander Mordvintsev released the [Deep Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream) project in 2015, machine learning imagery is often associated with surrealism. It is no doubt surreal to find oneself co-creating art by probing a disembodied cognitive system trained on billions of datapoints, and the images produced can be confounding and psychedelic. However these are characteristics often ascribed to new experience. New experiences are weird, until they are no longer.\n\nAt the advent of DALL·E 2 we find it quite useful to think instead to the history of the [Pictorialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictorialism#Overview) movement.\n\n![Edward Steichen: Rodin, Le Penseur (1902)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gW2JFPpDtCNgNT6L_7tvH.jpg?height=803&width=1000&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nIn the early to mid 19th century, photography was the domain of a select group of engineers and enthusiasts, as it required a great deal of technical knowledge to realize photographs. As such, the focus of these efforts and gauge of the success of the medium was to create images that most accurately reflected the reality they intended to capture.\n\nThe Pictorialists emerged in the late 19th century as a movement intent not on using photographic techniques to most accurately depict reality, instead opting to use photography as a medium of communicating subjective beauty. This movement progressed photography from a scientific to an expressive medium in parallel with increasing access to cameras that required no technical expertise (the first amateur camera, [the Kodak, was released in 1888](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_760118)).\n\n![Léonard Misonne: By The Mill (1910s)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KWRNtSYai5BP3YC5qtNUs.jpeg?height=787&width=1070&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nDebates raged about whether or not photography could in fact be *art*, a conversation inevitably dismissed once artists were able to affordably integrate cameras into their practices. The Pictorialists extolled the artistic potential of the camera by perverting its purported function of objectively capturing the world, staging scenes and experimenting with practical effects to create subjective and expressive works. Painters soon began integrating the camera into their workflow, and now most art forms make use of sensor based imaging in one form or another.\n\nLarry Tesler’s pithy description of AI, “Artificial intelligence is whatever hasn’t been done yet.”, is equally applicable looking back to the birth of photography. Photography had also *not been done yet*, and was then (a phenomenon described as [the AI effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect)) soon integrated into most artistic and industrial practices. Sensor based imaging remains a discrete focus of research pursuing things that have not been done yet.\n\nThe parallels with this time period are clear. In machine learning imagery, the laborious task to this point has been to legitimize the medium by attempting to accurately reflect the reality of training material. Great efforts have been made to realize a convincing and novel *dog* picture from training neural networks on *dogs*. This problem has been solved, and sets the foundation upon which we can begin to be expressive.\n\nAs happened with the Pictorialists, prompt based systems like DALL·E are democratizing the means by which anyone can create AI facilitated subjective art with next to no technical expertise necessary, and we assume that in the coming decades these techniques will be integrated into artistic and industrial practices to a great degree. AI will remain a discrete field of research exploring what has not been done yet, and in 2 years we will think nothing of painters using tools like DALL·E to audition concepts, or companies using tools like DALL·E to audition furniture for their office.\n\nDALL·E represents a shift from attempts to reflect objective reality to subjective play. Language is the lens by which we reveal the objective reality known to the neural network being explored. It is a latent(hidden) camera, uncovering snapshots of a vast and complex latent space.\n\nThe same debates will rage about whether or not prompt based AI imagery can be considered *Art*, and will just as inevitably be relegated to history once everyone makes use of these tools to better share what is on their mind.\n\nThe ever evolving pursuit of art is greatly benefitted from reducing any friction in sharing what is on your mind. The observer is the ultimate discriminator, and as with any technological development that makes achieving a particular outcome more frictionless, creating great art that speaks to people in the time that it is made remains an elusive and magical odyssey.\n\nThe easier it is to generate artworks, the more challenging it will be to generate distinction and meaning, as it ever was. Great Art, like AI, is very often what hasn’t been explored yet.\n\n### DALL·E, reflections and infinite images\n\nThe first time we really got excited about DALL·E was in discovering its capacity to produce internally coherent images. Internal coherence can best be described as the ability to create convincing relationships between objects generated within an image.\n\nTo test this capacity, we began to use InPaint to extend images that we uploaded to the system without contributing a linguistic prompt. To achieve this, we would manually shift the viewfinder of InPaint in either direction to extend the scene.\n\nOne particularly successful test involved extending the scene of symbolist painter Charles Guilloux’s work - *L'allée d'eau* (1895)\n\n![Charles Guilloux - L'allée d'eau (1895)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ELIKrPrGZCDeos4Xj9qol.jpg?height=733&width=960&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n![Charles Guilloux - L'allée d'eau (Extended with DALL·E by Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uHWIrvvT-eNCNMW4f2-BS.png?height=2331&width=3569&&&&size=medium)\n\nAs you can see, DALL·E is capable of comprehending the style and subject of the scene, and extending it coherently in all directions. Perhaps most notable is its capacity to produce reflections consistent with objects present within the image. The curvature of the trees and river is successfully reflected in the new water being generated.\n\nThis capacity for internal coherence could only happen within the (then) 512x512 pixel viewfinder of InPaint, however successfully demonstrated a capacity to produce images of potentially infinite scale by producing incremental coherent *patches* of an image.\n\nWe then extended this technique to produce very large pieces under the same reflective motif. The wall sized artworks below (produced with DALL·E 1 and InPaint) are we believe the largest compositions ever produced with machine learning at their time of creation.\n\n![Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (DALL·E 1 test image)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U-bzdprWFntyErCfsO9qH.png?height=1851&width=5977&&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\n![ Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (DALL·E 1 test image)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cfbWc1wLPWZyA2eSrmCIR.png?height=2154&width=4190&&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nThis process of creating a patchwork of internally coherent images to form a larger composition was very challenging, quite like attempting to paint a wall sized work from the vantage point of a magnifying glass, and with no master guide to follow. As such, we used techniques like horizon lines to retain coherence.\n\nThere is something poetic to composing in this way. Attempting to extrapolate a bigger picture with only access to a small piece of it at a time feels appropriate in the broader context of AI.\n\nWe have not yet been able to experiment with DALL-E 2 and InPaint together in the same way, however assume that even more coherent and vivid images can be produced using a similar patchwork technique.\n\nOne can imagine efforts being made to increase the coherence of a larger composition by analyzing elements contained within an image outside of the scope of the InPaint viewfinder. With these developments in mind, we expect that these tools will soon contain all the elements necessary to produce limitless resolution compositions guided by language and stylistic prompts.\n\n### Co-authoring narrative worlds\n\nWe began to make a series of infinite images extending horizontally, which allude to the potential for these tools to tell stories in the tradition of tapestries or graphic novels. This sequence below is large enough in resolution to be printed well, and is a narrative that could be extended to infinity.\n\n![Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (DALL·E 1 test narrative)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uOF6BJERGqfUE9J81U6R-.png?height=639&width=5668&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nTo return to the original idea of extending a painting to reveal more of the scene, what might it mean to be able to produce infinite worlds from a single painting or photograph? This significantly augments the capacity of what we understand of generative art, when a coherent world, or narrative, can be spawned from a single stylistic or linguistic prompt.\n\n![Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (DALL·E 1 test narrative)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j48RjuhWHn3_biDka4-uT.png?height=4096&width=17352&&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nOne can imagine narrative art forms like graphic novels or cinema being impacted from such a development. This is a particularly exciting prospect when considering the more recent development of prompt art bots being used in active Discord communities. The first of these we encountered was developed by [Wolf Bear Studio](http://wolfbearstudio.com/) for their Halloween themed art project [Ghouls ‘n GANs](https://www.ghoulsngans.io/), where discord users were invited to generate artworks via an in-thread bot, a concept more recently being experimented with by [Midjourney](https://twitter.com/midjourney) and the artist Glassface’s [iDreamer](https://idreamer.xyz/) project (also in collaboration with Wolf Bear).\n\nBots such as these, in combination with ideas such as Simon De La Rouviere’s [Untitled Frontier](https://www.untitledfrontier.studio/) experiment in narrative co-authorship, augur a future of co-creation not only with artificial intelligence systems, but also more frictionlessly with one another.\n\nThis speaks to the crux of what DALL·E *feels like*, a tool for jamming, rapid iteration and potentially co-authored social experiences. One can imagine group storytelling sessions online and IRL that produce vivid narrative art to be replayed later or viewed from afar.\n\nOnce the friction to share what is on your mind has been eliminated, the ability to co-create social narrative art experiences at the dinner table or the theatre seems conceivable and exciting!\n\n### DALL·E 2 and Spawning\n\nWe have only been working with DALL·E 2 for a short time, however what is clear is that the system has exponentially improved in terms of generated convincing and internally coherent images guided by language and image prompts.\n\nWe plan to publish more later on what we discover, however our initial experiments have involved further experimentation with the “Holly Herndon” embedding present within OpenAI CLIP. In lay terms, Holly meets the threshold of notoriety online to have characteristic elements of her image be understood by the CLIP language/image pairing network, something we explored last year with our [CLASSIFIED](https://foundation.app/collection/clsfd) series of self portraits created to reveal exactly what/who CLIP understands “Holly Herndon” to be.\n\nWe propose a term for this process, **Spawning**, a 21st century corollary to the 20th century process of sampling. If sampling afforded artists the ability to manipulate the artwork of others to collage together something new, spawning affords artists the ability to create entirely new artworks in the style of other people from AI systems trained on their work or likeness. As Holly recently communicated at the TED conference, this opens up the possibility for a new and mind-bending IP era of *Identity Play*, the ability to create works *as other people* in a responsible, fair and [permissive IP](https://www.thejaymo.net/2020/11/19/permissive-ips/) environment, something that we are exploring with the [Holly+](https://holly.mirror.xyz/54ds2IiOnvthjGFkokFCoaI4EabytH9xjAYy1irHy94) project.\n\n![Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (Holly Herndon Clones in a 3D animation style produced with DALL·E 2) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8pmVhuYofhaKRBVKzr6Gx.png?height=1360&width=2928&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nTools like DALL·E 2 and InPaint undoubtedly propel us closer to this eventuality, evidenced by these “Holly Herndon” style memes we were able to generate in early tests. \n\nMemes feel an appropriate medium for experimentation in this context, as any single meme maintains it’s vitality from its ability to be personalized and perpetually built upon. Memes are cultural embeddings, not dissimilar to the embeddings present within the latent space of a neural network. \n\nMemes are a distillation of a consensual/archetypical feeling or vibe, in much the way that the “Holly Herndon” embedding with CLIP is a distillation of her characteristic properties (ginger braid and bangs, blue eyes, often photographed with a laptop), or the “Salvador Dali” embedding is a distillation of his unique artistic style.\n\n![Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (Personalized Memes with DALL·E 2)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bt-AC_skTZP07HvRHI8h9.png?height=1024&width=3072&&&&&&&size=large)\n\nWe find personalized applications like this pretty exciting, as while DALL·E 2 (and it’s stunning variations feature we will cover at a later time) unlocks the ability to produce convincing images in art historical styles familiar to it’s training set, we feel that there could be a misconception that its utility is limited to solely recreating artistic expressions of the past.\n\nLike the introduction of the personal camera, it is easy to imagine a near future scenario in which all amateur and professional workflows across creative industries are augmented by these tools, helping people to more clearly depict what is in their mind through common language and an ever expanding training corpus.\n\nThe 21st century is going to be *wild*. We will share more as we learn more! 🦾\n\n![Holly Herndon & Mathew Dryhurst (\"A building that looks like Holly Herndon\", made with DALL·E 2)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IjS8ukonTqxpre1SehFYs.png?height=1024&width=1024&size=medium)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654277557, "digest": "efekFI71VVyGSTwDLvO3VziCMozwTXcuXGtCdB-qJ-I", "contributor": "0xB1F6C97F4D2FEBa6b128F7B6D364E1ED1dca0b99"}

Transactions on the blockchain are fully transparent, publicly accessible, and immutable.\n\nstatus quo\nThe pursuit of personal ownership and data sovereignty will also cause various security issues (because of differences in the level of individual understanding and familiarity with security knowledge), but these security issues should not become obstacles to the development of Web3.\nLet's look back in history: the similarities between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. The original version of SSL/TLS had serious vulnerabilities. Early security tools are usually rudimentary and further refined over time. From a certain perspective, Web3 security companies and projects, such as Certik, Forta, Slithe, and Securify, are the equivalent of code scanning and application security testing tools originally developed for Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 applications.\nHowever, in Web 2.0, a very important part of the security model is about the response. In Web3, a transaction cannot be changed once it is executed, so the idea of ​​security is usually that mechanisms need to be established to verify whether the transaction should have the conditions for security, and then proceed, that is, security must be better in terms of prevention.\nThe Web3 community must think about how to plan technically, address systemic weaknesses, and prevent and prevent new attack vectors that target cryptographic primitives and smart contract vulnerabilities.\n\nThere are four directions below, which can promote the prevention of Web3 security model.\nfour directions\nSource-of-truth data for vulnerabilities\nThere needs to be a source of truth for known Web3 (project) vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Today, there are already official vulnerability databases that provide core data for vulnerability management projects.\nWeb3 requires decentralized data correspondence work to eliminate information asymmetry. Currently, with incomplete (vulnerabilities, exposures, etc.) information scattered across the likes of SWC Registry, Rekt, Smart Contract Attack Vectors and DeFi Threat Matrix, Immunefi runs a bug bounty program to better find new weaknesses.\nSecurity decision-making norms\nIn Web3, key security design choices, and event decision models are still being explored. Decentralization means that no one can take full responsibility for these problems, and the impact on users can be huge. The recent Log4j vulnerability, for example, is a wake-up call to leave security concerns to the decentralized community.\nWhat is the Log4j vulnerability?\nThe Java open source tool log4j2 suddenly exposed a remote code execution vulnerability in December last year (a vulnerability that malicious actors can exploit to install malware on affected systems). Log4j2 is an open source log component tool applied to Java, which is widely used in business systems by many world-leading companies, well-known organizations and enterprises including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.\n\nLog4j2 is maintained by volunteers at the non-profit Apache Software Foundation.\nTherefore, it is necessary to further clarify how DAOs, security experts, Web3 infrastructure providers such as Alchemy and Infura, and other relevant departments cooperate to deal with emergent security issues. However, you can refer to the experience of large open source communities forming OpenSSF and CNCF advisory groups to establish processes for dealing with security issues.\nAuthentication and signing\nMost dApps on the market today, many do not have authentication or signatures for API responses. This means that when the user's wallet retrieves data from these DApps, there is a risk in verifying that such responses are from the intended (real and not fake) application and that the data has been tampered with.\nIn a world where Dapps do not have the best way to adopt basic security routines, users can only confirm their security status and credibility. This is very difficult, and there really needs to be a better way to alert users to risks .\n\nBetter key management experience (Easier, user-controlled key management)\nKey management is the basis for users to conduct transactions in the Web3 paradigm. Keys are also notoriously difficult to manage, and much of the encryption business has and will continue to revolve around key management.\nThe complexity and risk of managing private keys is also one of the main reasons why users choose custodial wallets over non-custodial wallets. However, the use of escrow wallets will lead to new phenomena: new \"intermediary products\", such as Coinbase, will be generated, which will be detrimental to the direction and ideal of Web3's complete decentralization; to a certain extent, it will also limit users' use of Web3 The ability to provide all the advantages. Ideally, further security innovations will provide users with better usability protection user experience in unmanaged scenarios.\nNotably, the first two (truth-source vulnerability data and prescriptive security decisions) initiatives revolve more around people and processes, while the third and fourth require new technological changes. Keeping new technologies, new processes, and large numbers of users in sync is one of the challenges of Web3 security.\nHowever, one thing is still very encouraging: Web3 security innovation is carried out in an open, open source environment, and creative solutions will emerge in such a scenario.\n\nTwitter：@Raca_Doge", "timestamp": 1654277713, "digest": "HfDWozHJfMHwHnaeORHY84GkXeqVB2LZ5Yaj3FmpmL4", "contributor": "0xB727932e7ae65364DA8FbC9254739268B9fE6C1A"}
{"id": "VeWRWTJqN_TLtDbPz_9c8v6fixaQLkfbv3mc6oMaEEw", "title": "Hyype X Cashie: Artist Spotlight", "body": "This interview with [@Cassieblanks](https://twitter.com/cassieblanks) (Cashie) is part of the Written Interview Series from [@HyypeHQ](https://twitter.com/hyypeHQ). \n\n**Anaroth:** Can you share a little about the transition you made as a creator from drawing to animation? I feel like that had to be such a powerful unlock.\n\n**Cashie:** I have been drawing since I was a kid, and growing up is hard, there are so many paths to choose. I made the choice to drop my drawing career and find another path because I had this feeling that I wasn’t good enough. Then this friend of mine invited me to an animation workshop, and from there I learned a lot about animation. After months of attending the workshop, finally I had a chance to have a freelance job for a 2DFX artist in the animation industry. I honed my skills there for about five years but due to the pandemic and the impacts that it had I quit that job. I decided to take a gamble on this NFT world as an animator from the start. It turned out to be a great decision, and I am happy to have the opportunities I do.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HiVjrQ2R5q-Il31OPCLI0.png?height=2941&width=4096)\n\n**Anaroth:** How did you discover NFTs? Do you find yourself still collecting today? Any grails you wish you had?\n\n**Cashie:** I had this friend of mine that introduced me to this play2earn game called Axie Infinity last July 2021. I was shocked because I had no idea that you could really earn money playing a game. From this entry point I learned about a lot of NFT games, from Cryptoblades and some other BSC Smartchain games and things that ultimately went to zero. It happens to the best of us. \n\nThat being said I learned a lot about liquidity and coin trading from my time in that space. How I was able to leverage Pancakeswap and stuff. It had been a lot of fun learning and understanding this new knowledge. However, because things didn’t pan out, yeah I became real broke after that. This is when I decided to lay low from Play2earn and start doing some of the Art contest from NFT projects. From there I found myself getting to know projects like BAYC, Doodles, Cool Cats and others. I was late! I wish instead of investing in Axie back during that time of July, I should have  minted some BAYC or some Doodles and other bluechips, but I was late. I already saw them around 1 ETH and I didn’t even have a basic grasp of what it was. That’s why I was afraid of investing that amount of money, but I wish I did! If i could just go back in time, damnit what a real life changing opportunity that would be. Haha!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d1kSvTJffnbuTA5tFIWqx.png?height=2160&width=3840)\n\n**Anaroth:** I know you get a lot of commission requests, what advice do you have for Artists that are looking to do more commission work? When and how do you allow yourself to say no?\n\n**Cashie:** Low prices can be a good weapon for being a commission related artist for startups. Just letting the world see what you can do with those prices, eventually people will start questioning you why your prices are dirt cheap. I swear, someone actually said exactly that to me. That’s when I knew my work was able to be priced higher than I had been. This also allowed me to start picking who I would want to work with. \n\nSaying No can be hard sometimes. For me, if it is hard for me to imagine what it would be and the schedule is real tight, I’ll definitely pass. I find unwanted commission work could burn out a weeks worth of energy in a single day for me. Be mindful of yourself and stay in stuff you can handle. Do not gamble with your mental health, it is too important.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P3msWYqj6oAQK5yE-T6cH.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n**Anaroth:** When you reflect back on some of your favorite pieces of artwork, is there a central theme that you feel connects them?\n\n**Cashie:** Every moving element is my other form of inspiration, just a fire in a candle can get the juices flowing in my creative brain and start seeing the beauty of it. Waves of ocean would, ripples in a glass of water, the rain, the cigarette smoke. It all mesmerizes me, and keeps me inspired.\n\nFor now I cant feel that central theme, since i worked on a lot of 2DFX and animation design on clients such as Disney, Warner Bros, Nickeldeon, MLP and others. There we are forced to alter our design to what the client wants. That’s why I have this wide range of style, but don’t necessarily feel like I have a signature design / style yet, and I do wish I did.\n\n**Anaroth:** Has your NFT commission success changed the way you think about opportunities in your future?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8X35bH00OdDlh8UCxqCKJ.png?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n**Cashie:**  One day, I will find myself as a signature artist too. It is my dream. I aspire to be my own Beeple or Gxngyxng, Deekay, Burnt Toast, or some other 1/1 Artist’s out there. It’s my goal now, and I will keep pursuing light in the dark.\n\n**Anaroth:** Who is someone you would like to collaborate with and why? Have you reached out to them to do so?\n\n**Cashie:** Gxngyxng of Ghxst and Deekay are my dudes of inspiration! i literally stare at the blank sky and think on how to be like them. Once I build my foundation of being a 1/1 Artist, maybe then I will finally have the courage to come up with plans on collaborating with them. It would be really special to have that opportunity.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kbx6C9RyNgJQOQ7KuWtIk.png?height=2000&width=2000)\n\n**Anaroth:** How do you overcome a creative block? How does a deadline impact your creativity?\n\n**Cashie:** For me I find taking a rest, or watching some awesome anime is always a good move for me to recover from a creative block I have. A deadline doesn’t impact my creativity very much, because before I start the commission, it is already finished in my head. It is kind of pre rendered in my brain. I will just need some coffee, and some good music for me to start kicking.\n\n### Don’t see your NFT community listed on Hyy.pe? 👀\n\nWe are expanding to as many collections as fast as we can.

{"id": "Mw3Op4qmOMBBFNiLvd3OxuLujXI8Du_0vfRiqfRkMlI", "title": "Hyype X Cashie: Artist Spotlight", "body": "This interview with [@Cassieblanks](https://twitter.com/cassieblanks) (Cashie) is part of the Written Interview Series from [@HyypeHQ](https://twitter.com/hyypeHQ). \n\n**Anaroth:** Can you share a little about the transition you made as a creator from drawing to animation? I feel like that had to be such a powerful unlock.\n\n**Cashie:** I have been drawing since I was a kid, and growing up is hard, there are so many paths to choose. I made the choice to drop my drawing career and find another path because I had this feeling that I wasn’t good enough. Then this friend of mine invited me to an animation workshop, and from there I learned a lot about animation. After months of attending the workshop, finally I had a chance to have a freelance job for a 2DFX artist in the animation industry. I honed my skills there for about five years but due to the pandemic and the impacts that it had I quit that job. I decided to take a gamble on this NFT world as an animator from the start. It turned out to be a great decision, and I am happy to have the opportunities I do.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HiVjrQ2R5q-Il31OPCLI0.png?height=2941&width=4096)\n\n**Anaroth:** How did you discover NFTs? Do you find yourself still collecting today? Any grails you wish you had?\n\n**Cashie:** I had this friend of mine that introduced me to this play2earn game called Axie Infinity last July 2021. I was shocked because I had no idea that you could really earn money playing a game. From this entry point I learned about a lot of NFT games, from Cryptoblades and some other BSC Smartchain games and things that ultimately went to zero. It happens to the best of us. \n\nThat being said I learned a lot about liquidity and coin trading from my time in that space. How I was able to leverage Pancakeswap and stuff. It had been a lot of fun learning and understanding this new knowledge. However, because things didn’t pan out, yeah I became real broke after that. This is when I decided to lay low from Play2earn and start doing some of the Art contest from NFT projects. From there I found myself getting to know projects like BAYC, Doodles, Cool Cats and others. I was late! I wish instead of investing in Axie back during that time of July, I should have  minted some BAYC or some Doodles and other bluechips, but I was late. I already saw them around 1 ETH and I didn’t even have a basic grasp of what it was. That’s why I was afraid of investing that amount of money, but I wish I did! If i could just go back in time, damnit what a real life changing opportunity that would be. Haha!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d1kSvTJffnbuTA5tFIWqx.png?height=2160&width=3840)\n\n**Anaroth:** I know you get a lot of commission requests, what advice do you have for Artists that are looking to do more commission work? When and how do you allow yourself to say no?\n\n**Cashie:** Low prices can be a good weapon for being a commission related artist for startups. Just letting the world see what you can do with those prices, eventually people will start questioning you why your prices are dirt cheap. I swear, someone actually said exactly that to me. That’s when I knew my work was able to be priced higher than I had been. This also allowed me to start picking who I would want to work with. \n\nSaying No can be hard sometimes. For me, if it is hard for me to imagine what it would be and the schedule is real tight, I’ll definitely pass. I find unwanted commission work could burn out a weeks worth of energy in a single day for me. Be mindful of yourself and stay in stuff you can handle. Do not gamble with your mental health, it is too important.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P3msWYqj6oAQK5yE-T6cH.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n**Anaroth:** When you reflect back on some of your favorite pieces of artwork, is there a central theme that you feel connects them?\n\n**Cashie:** Every moving element is my other form of inspiration, just a fire in a candle can get the juices flowing in my creative brain and start seeing the beauty of it. Waves of ocean would, ripples in a glass of water, the rain, the cigarette smoke. It all mesmerizes me, and keeps me inspired.\n\nFor now I cant feel that central theme, since i worked on a lot of 2DFX and animation design on clients such as Disney, Warner Bros, Nickeldeon, MLP and others. There we are forced to alter our design to what the client wants. That’s why I have this wide range of style, but don’t necessarily feel like I have a signature design / style yet, and I do wish I did.\n\n**Anaroth:** Has your NFT commission success changed the way you think about opportunities in your future?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8X35bH00OdDlh8UCxqCKJ.png?height=3000&width=3000)\n\n**Cashie:**  One day, I will find myself as a signature artist too. It is my dream. I aspire to be my own Beeple or Gxngyxng, Deekay, Burnt Toast, or some other 1/1 Artist’s out there. It’s my goal now, and I will keep pursuing light in the dark.\n\n**Anaroth:** Who is someone you would like to collaborate with and why? Have you reached out to them to do so?\n\n**Cashie:** Gxngyxng of Ghxst and Deekay are my dudes of inspiration! i literally stare at the blank sky and think on how to be like them. Once I build my foundation of being a 1/1 Artist, maybe then I will finally have the courage to come up with plans on collaborating with them. It would be really special to have that opportunity.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kbx6C9RyNgJQOQ7KuWtIk.png?height=2000&width=2000)\n\n**Anaroth:** How do you overcome a creative block? How does a deadline impact your creativity?\n\n**Cashie:** For me I find taking a rest, or watching some awesome anime is always a good move for me to recover from a creative block I have. A deadline doesn’t impact my creativity very much, because before I start the commission, it is already finished in my head. It is kind of pre rendered in my brain. I will just need some coffee, and some good music for me to start kicking.\n\n### Don’t see your NFT community listed on Hyy.pe? 👀\n\nWe are expanding to as many collections as fast as we can.

{"id": "EjtakXy1kCP-DebC8tdW63XH-t2sQR5m0CcDr6DHpZs", "title": "Arweave - The Modern Library of Alexandria", "body": "Over the past year and a half, I – like many others – have gone deep down the crypto rabbit hole. After casually trading for a number of years, I began digging a few layers deeper by reading posts and Twitter threads from [Chris Dixon](https://onezero.medium.com/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e), which led to sifting through [A16Z’s Crypto Cannon](https://a16z.com/2018/02/10/crypto-readings-resources/). Before I knew it, I was diving down the literal [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg/), acquiring digital assets across far too many wallets and exchanges, feeling distracted by the constant notifications from Twitter/Telegram/Discord, and spending my weekends figuring out *how in the world* to buy promising, esoteric assets that are difficult to acquire in the US like [Arweave](https://arweave.news/how-to-buy-arweave-token/).\n\nFor folks like myself who are prone to diving headfirst into tech rabbit holes, it’s become impossible to ignore the substantive activity happening on the frontiers of crypto. Over the past year, Web3 certainly became a more frequent topic of conversation as terms like decentralization, NFT, and DeFi became part of the tech vernacular. Many people (myself included) have now gained a level of understanding to make the transition from viewing crypto as a speculative world of assets with little underlying value to the [next computing platform shift](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201621266534402). What’s most exciting to me is it feels like [the pioneers of our day](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1454466406133735432) are building on the frontier of Web3.\n\nI plan on writing about Web3 more frequently going forward. The goal of my posts is to explore the frontiers of crypto and blockchain technology through the lens of specific projects that make me excited about the future. The plan is to spend more time writing about earlier stage, low market cap crypto assets, DAOs, NFTs, and other projects on the bleeding edge of Web3 innovation. I’ll caveat that by saying I may write about some more established projects (as I do in this post) if they play into important trends shaping Web3 today.\n\nThe beauty of writing publicly is I can create personal accountability and a regular cadence around codifying my thoughts on the space, while sharing and collaborating with other folks in the crypto community. Also, the hope is I’ll be able to surface some exciting projects for those following along. Feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stevencook_) if you’re interested in connecting to trade notes and collab!\n\nTo kick things off, here is one crypto project I’m super excited about...\n\n## Arweave - The Modern Library of Alexandria\n\n![Arweave transactions chart as of Nov. 1, 2021: 79.3% Month-on-Month growth in data stored; 1,077% growth in 3 months.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cZ28nE3GXoHeTw7JSguvq.png?height=573&width=601)\n\n### What is Arweave?\n\nArweave is a new type of storage that backs data with sustainable and perpetual endowments, allowing users and developers to truly store data forever – for the very first time. Think of Arweave as a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets.\n\nThe protocol matches people who have hard drive space to spare with individuals and organizations that need to permanently store data or host content. This is similar to how Uber connects drivers with people who need transport.\n\nPermanent storage is achieved through Arweave’s decentralized data storage solution operating with blockweave technology and the native Arweave token (AR). Users of the network can pay a one-time endowment to use and provide permanent and immutable data storage. Anyone can contribute to the network and be compensated for renting out unused storage space on their computer. Arweave designed the novel Succinct Proofs of Random Access (SPoRA) consensus mechanism to maintain stability and security throughout the network. On top of the core Arweave protocol lives the permaweb: A global, permanent web of pages and applications that live forever. Once a user adds data to the permaweb, it cannot be altered or removed, even by the creator.\n\nThis description only scratches the surface of the mechanics of Arweave. For a more detailed breakdown of how Arweave works behind the scenes, check out the [Arweave Lightpaper](https://www.arweave.org/files/arweave-lightpaper.pdf).\n\n### Why am I excited about Arweave?\n\nArweave was one of the first crypto projects that had me in awe of the capabilities of blockchain technology. It’s worth pausing for a moment to marvel at the business model innovation conceived by Arweave founder [Sam Williams](https://twitter.com/samecwilliams).\n\nThe innovation lies in the fact that you can store something *permanently for a one-time fee*. When you think about storage analogs in Web2 (Box, Dropbox, AWS, etc.) or even Web3 analogs like [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/), storage always involves a recurring subscription cost. If you don’t pay that subscription, then you lose your ability to store data.\n\nCompared to these prior iterations of storage products, Arweave’s ability to offer perpetual storage for an up-front fee is completely novel. These sorts of blockchain innovations are examples of making the transition from [Web3’s skeuomorphic phase](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026963037589522), with projects that resemble products from Web2, to entirely novel projects enabled *only* by blockchain technology.\n\nArweave has been on a tear recently. To date, the protocol’s volume has been largely driven by [NFTs](https://arweave.medium.com/permanent-nft-storage-on-the-arweave-network-41f38d700a2d) and the data storage requirements of other Layer-1 blockchains like [Solana](https://solana.com/ecosystem/arweave). As illustrated in the visual below, it recently overtook the top storage protocol Filecoin as the most active storage protocol.\n\n![While Filecoin has generated more total revenue, Arweave produced more revenue than Filecoin over the past two quarters (data as of October 12th, 2021).](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rC3lhRrUZoQ003F2DpwS8.jpeg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nIn fact, [Mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/), an up-and-coming decentralized and user-owned publishing platform that hosts this post, leverages Arweave to host all user blogs to ensure that censorship is near-impossible.\n\nArweave is quickly becoming a critical piece of Web3 infrastructure. If you believe Web3 will be more prominent in 10 years than it is now, Arweave will likely be a vital player in that development.\n\nToday, most people aren’t even aware that permanent data is an option. Mass adoption will require greater awareness, public discovery, and developer education. The general public will begin to care about Arweave when they see it solving problems that can’t be solved in any other way: lawyers who need to save contracts permanently, historians who want to archive one-of-a-kind documents, artists who want to ensure their work reaches future generations.\n\nAfter much trial and error, I finally found a way to acquire Arweave in the US. Details [here](https://arweave.news/how-to-buy-arweave-token/). The difficulty lies in the fact that most centralized exchanges like FTX, Binance, and Coinbase don’t support Areave trading in the US. Decentralized exchanges like Uniswap don’t list Arweave as an available asset either. Major shout out to [everPay](https://everpay.io/), a real-time payment protocol, which uses Arweave to store all everPay transactions.

{"id": "zzuJ8aKh2QoXNie_W2rjKq8zXFf4eb8pkJyw5HCgoMU", "title": "Studying the Optimism Collective", "body": "***Disclosure: You may already be a winner of the*** ***[$OP token sweepstakes](https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/check). I am serving as a delegate for the Optimism Token House.***\n\nThis week Optimism dropped the $OP token, initiating Optimism Governance. Optimism’s governance system presents an exciting opportunity to study the latest thinking in governance design and helps us focus on shaping the next era of Web3 through its focus on public goods. With the launch of the token, Optimism created the Optimism Collective, an ecosystem that will govern the distribution of public goods funding derived from the revenue the protocol generates. The Optimism Collective is governed by three bodies: the Token House (holders of $OP), the Citizens’ House (select NFT holders), and the Foundation. Optimism’s structure is notable for its balance of power between the three governing bodies, the use of multiple voting styles (token-weighted and one-person, one-vote), and the Collective’s commitment to experimentation.\n\n*What is Optimism?*\n\nOptimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is an optimistic rollup: it is optimistic, because it assumes transactions submitted to it by users are valid; it is a rollup, because it sequences transactions off of Ethereum and periodically submits a merkle root of the transactions to Ethereum to create a resulting state change. Given that Optimism’s sequencer does not ensure the same security as Ethereum, Optimism creates a dispute period after its sequencer publishes a batch of transactions, during which a party can challenge a state change with a fault proof (for a reward) which will prevent the state change from being committed to Ethereum. Optimism is the first layer 2 to achieve EVM equivalence, meaning that there is no difference between how smart contracts are executed on L2 and L1, which makes deployment on Optimism easier.\n\n*The Optimism Collective — Mission*\n\nThe Optimism Collective is guided by a vision of “sustainably fund\\[ing\\] those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond.” In essence, Optimism is devoting protocol revenue tokenholders and trusted stewards of the community to fund public goods projects that create compounding value for Optimism and eventually Web3 and broader society. The Collective was created with a view toward making public goods creation profitable, meaning “impact=profit.” The Collective seeks to achieve its mission by funding public goods both proactively and retroactively. Proactive funding encourages innovation and risk-taking in the pursuit of public goods; retroactive funding ensures that impactful projects are rewarded.\n\n*Balance of Powers*\n\nOptimism seeks to balance the short-term and long-term views of the community by balancing power between the Token House, the Citizens’ House, and the Foundation.\n\n![Optimism Governance Overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*V9XR86iMDooYoZBg.jpeg)\n\nThe Token House is entrusted to make determinations about project incentives, protocol upgrades, and the appropriation of treasury funds to the Foundation. By leveraging the collective knowledge of the Token House, the Collective is able to improve the predictive power of its grants and adjust to the specific needs of the Optimism community. The democratic aspect of the Token House ensures that the users of the protocol have representation in determining the future of the protocol’s mission and function.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will focus on retroactive public goods funding. Citizens will be selected from the community; their citizenship is non-transferrable. By selecting individuals who have demonstrated value to the Optimism ecosystem, the Collective will increase the likelihood that retroactive funding represents true value provided to the community. Having a consistency of identity creates continuity in criteria and makes long-term decision-making possible. The method for selecting Citizens will be determined by the Foundation in consultation with the Token House.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is the steward of the Collective. It oversees the administration of governance, allocates treasury assets (including the distribution of $OP), vetoes malicious proposals, and has the power to amend the Constitution. The Foundation has many stabilizing powers for the community, yet its capabilities remain in check by the Token House. The Token House can remove directors from the Foundation and veto changes to the founding documents that would materially impair tokenholders’ rights.\n\n*Mixed Voting*\n\nThe Token House and Citizens’ House have different forms of voting to suit different functions. The Token House votes on a token-weighted basis. As in any token-weighted system, Token House voting is susceptible to plutocratic concentration of power and voter apathy. The Token House permits tokenholders to delegate their votes to stewards who have made public commitments to act as stewards for the Collective. Delegation may mitigate the power of individual holders who have high concentrations of power by enabling smaller holders to pool their votes through a delegate. Delegation also ensures that there are members of the community who are dedicated to participating in governance, mitigating the chance that small groups can collude to pass self-interested proposals with a quorum.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will operate through a one-person, one-vote system. Presuming that Citizens are chosen based on their specific insights and dedication to the ecosystem, the one-person, one-vote structure is sensible: newly minted citizens will have equal footing with incumbents for decision-making. In addition to preventing plutocratic domination, a non-transferrable one-person, one-vote system will avoid the volatility that accompanies rapid transfer of liquid governance tokens.\n\nBringing a token-weighted system together with a one-person, one-vote system creates a balance between the short-term and the long-term as well as between the prospective and retroactive. Both Houses come together to determine the Optimism network parameters, which affects the balance between transaction volume on the Optimism network and funding supply for retroactive public goods funding. This balance keeps the present and future health of the protocol fairly represented: tokenholders are not unfairly called upon to subsidize large-scale infrastructural projects, while citizens have a voice in projecting long-term funding needs to improve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n*Experimentation*\n\nOptimism’s Working Constitution is brief, but the first principle is “a commitment to experimentation.” Projects that have a need for a complex beginning also have a need for flexibility. At the point of initiation, the Optimism community can only match an understanding of their needs with governance theory and the knowledge of how other DAOs have succeeded and failed. To ensure the success of the governance process, the community needs to commit to a flexible system in order to test theory with community-specific data. By focusing on experimentation, Optimism will collect important data on what principles and rules best suit the mission of funding public goods and use that data to create a better fit between the Collective’s mission and its procedure.\n\nEarly experimentation mitigates path-dependency. By maintaining a commitment to testing theories, the community encourages honesty about the value of the governance systems it tries. A collective mindset of flexibility also encourages the community to innovate, as the cost of failure is lowered and the value of the data collected is high. If early rules are rigid, systems may proceed despite inefficiencies and flaws in the early design, and the longer the flaws linger, the more difficult it becomes to remedy them in the future.\n\nThe results of the Collective’s experiments will be public goods in themselves. Optimism will be highly visible given its critical role in scaling Ethereum, which means that its governance process will be on display for other communities that are working hard to discover the appropriate mission-governance fit. Each pitfall and success will update the Web3 community’s knowledge of how to construct a long-term sustainable system of ordering the relationships between tokenholders and their rights.\n\n*Moving Forward*\n\nFor those who are looking to design governance systems for their own projects, it is worthwhile to observe Optimism’s governance process as it proceeds. The Optimism Collective combines the learnings of the last few years of DAO design and adds new structures that may succeed or fail. As you observe Optimism’s experiment, as with your own experiments, watch for whether its structure progresses in line with its mission.

{"id": "R2K1IH1G-x_KacnZqESWU-AIxlFI838GlfhOCIyRdWE", "title": "Dtravel v2 and Beyond\n", "body": "With the launch of Dtravel v2 right around the corner, now’s the perfect opportunity to shed more light on what to expect and what the vision is beyond the v2 product.\n\nAs the second version of a long-term product, Dtravel v2 is still very early in the life of the project, but lays an important foundation for the decentralized short-term rental ecosystem that’s being built, which will continue to evolve, expand and improve with time.\n\nIn this article, we’ll discuss what differentiates Dtravel v2 from web2 platforms, why we chose a host-first approach for Dtravel v2, and how we’re building a guest experience that embodies the ethos of decentralization.\n\n## The Web3 Travel Tool\n\nDtravel is a tool rather than a platform. By combining the freedom of direct booking sites with the simplicity of online travel agencies, Dtravel v2 creates a unique web3 travel ecosystem that benefits both hosts and guests.\n\nAs a web3 ecosystem, there’s no intermediary between hosts and guests who use Dtravel. Bookings are conducted on-chain in a peer-to-peer manner, with Dtravel acting solely as the technology provider that facilitates these transactions.\n\nThis distinguishes Dtravel from existing web2 short-term rental platforms and online travel agencies, since Dtravel doesn’t exercise control over booking payments, disputes or policies. We believe that hosts deserve greater ownership of their short-term rental businesses to prevent their businesses from being at the mercy of unpredictable or inconsistent third-party policies and decisions.\n\nThe launch of Dtravel v2 aims to lower the barrier to entry for hosts and property managers while establishing a direct booking channel that offers lower fees, greater control and unrestricted guest communication.\n\nFollowing the launch of Dtravel v2 — which was designed with hosts in mind and enables travelers to book directly with hosts — the attention will turn to building a better guest experience that allows travelers to efficiently find and book Dtravel properties around the world.\n\n## Designed for Hosts\n\nDtravel v2 is a host-centric product specifically designed for hosts and property managers to easily embark on their web3 short-term rental journeys. Hosts will be able to list their properties on Dtravel via a property management system (PMS) — currently [Hostaway](https://www.hostaway.com/), with more PMS integrations on the way — in just a few clicks.\n\n​​With a PMS, hosts can manage bookings, pricing, calendars, guest information, financial reports, guest communications, cleaning duties and more across all booking platforms using one interface. This means minimal effort is spent to establish Dtravel as an additional channel, reducing the time burden of listing properties.\n\nThe host-first approach was implemented for several key reasons. First, bookings increase as the supply of available properties increases. As a global project, it’s crucial to build a product that initially prioritizes building distributed supply which can meet the demand of travelers. Without a strong foundation of properties, Dtravel cannot flourish.\n\nSecond, the problem of ownership is primarily applicable to hosts’ businesses. Most guests only book a handful of stays each year. Most hosts, however, manage their short-term rental business almost daily, which is subject to certain limitations of the platforms their properties are listed on, such as the terms, policies and page layout. Web3 is all about creating an ownership economy, starting with those who are most affected.\n\nThird, the hosting process is significantly more involved than the guest booking process. Hosts set their cancellation policy and booking rules, choose the payment methods they wish to accept from guests — including selected cryptocurrencies, fiat currency via Stripe, or both — and connect their non-custodial wallets (if accepting cryptocurrencies). Hosts who haven’t had much prior exposure to web3 applications may also require additional time to ensure their businesses are set up optimally.\n\nThe success of Dtravel depends on the success of hosts. Without hosts, there are no guests and there is no Dtravel. For this reason, we ran (and will continue to run) the Host Beta Program: to ensure we build what hosts truly want, not what we think they want.\n\nThe next critical step is to create a guest experience that allows for the efficient searchability of listings. With Dtravel listings initially only bookable directly via a unique link, we recognize the need for guests to have a simple way of viewing and comparing available listings on Dtravel.\n\n## Building the Guest Experience\n\nDtravel v2 will enable guests to book with hosts via a unique link, much like a typical direct booking website that leads straight to a host’s or hotel’s own website. However, sending potential guests to this link requires marketing power, which is one of the core obstacles of direct bookings.\n\nDesigning a way for guests to easily discover Dtravel properties is therefore the next large-scale task that will serve to connect hosts and guests, creating a more cohesive ecosystem. This is where Dtravel’s novel crossover between direct bookings and online travel agencies will happen.\n\nTo do so in a way that is consistent with the web3 ethos of decentralization, a balance needs to be struck to avoid the trap of becoming a web2 platform. Guests require the ability to find and compare listings, while hosts must continue to retain full ownership over their businesses.\n\nThere are various considerations to factor in when addressing this problem, such as whether an aggregator model should be used, how listings will be ranked, whether hosts should have the flexibility to opt-in to the proposed model, and many others.\n\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to build for the community, we’re currently exploring potential solutions with hosts in our Host Beta Program. We’re also inviting travelers to participate in our [Guest Beta Program](https://d2bpe117hv9.typeform.com/guestsurvey) and share the most important parts of the guest travel experience to help shape what a native web3 guest experience might look like.\n\nWith Dtravel v2 set to launch in the coming weeks, you’ll soon be able to take the plunge into a web3 travel ecosystem as either a host or guest (or both!).

{"id": "GO8CSigeJPxQl4BCuzrLIN24FXXzmhyL9_reL5gH6Xw", "title": "Studying the Optimism Collective", "body": "***Disclosure: You may already be a winner of the*** ***[$OP token sweepstakes](https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/check). I am serving as a delegate for the Optimism Token House.***\n\nThis week Optimism dropped the $OP token, initiating Optimism Governance. Optimism’s governance system presents an exciting opportunity to study the latest thinking in governance design and helps us focus on shaping the next era of Web3 through its focus on public goods. With the launch of the token, Optimism created the Optimism Collective, an ecosystem that will govern the distribution of public goods funding derived from the revenue the protocol generates. The Optimism Collective is governed by three bodies: the Token House (holders of $OP), the Citizens’ House (select NFT holders), and the Foundation. Optimism’s structure is notable for its balance of power between the three governing bodies, the use of multiple voting styles (token-weighted and one-person, one-vote), and the Collective’s commitment to experimentation.\n\n*What is Optimism?*\n\nOptimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is an optimistic rollup: it is optimistic, because it assumes transactions submitted to it by users are valid; it is a rollup, because it sequences transactions off of Ethereum and periodically submits a merkle root of the transactions to Ethereum to create a resulting state change. Given that Optimism’s sequencer does not ensure the same security as Ethereum, Optimism creates a dispute period after its sequencer publishes a batch of transactions, during which a party can challenge a state change with a fault proof (for a reward) which will prevent the state change from being committed to Ethereum. Optimism is the first layer 2 to achieve EVM equivalence, meaning that there is no difference between how smart contracts are executed on L2 and L1, which makes deployment on Optimism easier.\n\n*The Optimism Collective — Mission*\n\nThe Optimism Collective is guided by a vision of “sustainably fund\\[ing\\] those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond.” In essence, Optimism is devoting protocol revenue tokenholders and trusted stewards of the community to fund public goods projects that create compounding value for Optimism and eventually Web3 and broader society. The Collective was created with a view toward making public goods creation profitable, meaning “impact=profit.” The Collective seeks to achieve its mission by funding public goods both proactively and retroactively. Proactive funding encourages innovation and risk-taking in the pursuit of public goods; retroactive funding ensures that impactful projects are rewarded.\n\n*Balance of Power*\n\nOptimism seeks to balance the short-term and long-term views of the community by balancing power between the Token House, the Citizens’ House, and the Foundation.\n\n![Optimism Governance Overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*V9XR86iMDooYoZBg.jpeg)\n\nThe Token House is entrusted to make determinations about project incentives, protocol upgrades, and the appropriation of treasury funds to the Foundation. By leveraging the collective knowledge of the Token House, the Collective is able to improve the predictive power of its grants and adjust to the specific needs of the Optimism community. The democratic aspect of the Token House ensures that the users of the protocol have representation in determining the future of the protocol’s mission and function.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will focus on retroactive public goods funding. Citizens will be selected from the community; their citizenship is non-transferrable. By selecting individuals who have demonstrated value to the Optimism ecosystem, the Collective will increase the likelihood that retroactive funding represents true value provided to the community. Having a consistency of identity creates continuity in criteria and makes long-term decision-making possible. The method for selecting Citizens will be determined by the Foundation in consultation with the Token House.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is the steward of the Collective. It oversees the administration of governance, allocates treasury assets (including the distribution of $OP), vetoes malicious proposals, and has the power to amend the Constitution. The Foundation has many stabilizing powers for the community, yet its capabilities remain in check by the Token House. The Token House can remove directors from the Foundation and veto changes to the founding documents that would materially impair tokenholders’ rights.\n\n*Mixed Voting*\n\nThe Token House and Citizens’ House have different forms of voting to suit different functions. The Token House votes on a token-weighted basis. As in any token-weighted system, Token House voting is susceptible to plutocratic concentration of power and voter apathy. The Token House permits tokenholders to delegate their votes to stewards who have made public commitments to act as stewards for the Collective. Delegation may mitigate the power of individual holders who have high concentrations of power by enabling smaller holders to pool their votes through a delegate. Delegation also ensures that there are members of the community who are dedicated to participating in governance, mitigating the chance that small groups can collude to pass self-interested proposals with a quorum.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will operate through a one-person, one-vote system. Presuming that Citizens are chosen based on their specific insights and dedication to the ecosystem, the one-person, one-vote structure is sensible: newly minted citizens will have equal footing with incumbents for decision-making. In addition to preventing plutocratic domination, a non-transferrable one-person, one-vote system will avoid the volatility that accompanies rapid transfer of liquid governance tokens.\n\nBringing a token-weighted system together with a one-person, one-vote system creates a balance between the short-term and the long-term as well as between the prospective and retroactive. Both Houses come together to determine the Optimism network parameters, which affects the balance between transaction volume on the Optimism network and funding supply for retroactive public goods funding. This balance keeps the present and future health of the protocol fairly represented: tokenholders are not unfairly called upon to subsidize large-scale infrastructural projects, while citizens have a voice in projecting long-term funding needs to improve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n*Experimentation*\n\nOptimism’s Working Constitution is brief, but the first principle is “a commitment to experimentation.” Projects that have a need for a complex beginning also have a need for flexibility. At the point of initiation, the Optimism community can only match an understanding of their needs with governance theory and the knowledge of how other DAOs have succeeded and failed. To ensure the success of the governance process, the community needs to commit to a flexible system in order to test theory with community-specific data. By focusing on experimentation, Optimism will collect important data on what principles and rules best suit the mission of funding public goods and use that data to create a better fit between the Collective’s mission and its procedure.\n\nEarly experimentation mitigates path-dependency. By maintaining a commitment to testing theories, the community encourages honesty about the value of the governance systems it tries. A collective mindset of flexibility also encourages the community to innovate, as the cost of failure is lowered and the value of the data collected is high. If early rules are rigid, systems may proceed despite inefficiencies and flaws in the early design, and the longer the flaws linger, the more difficult it becomes to remedy them in the future.\n\nThe results of the Collective’s experiments will be public goods in themselves. Optimism will be highly visible given its critical role in scaling Ethereum, which means that its governance process will be on display for other communities that are working hard to discover the appropriate mission-governance fit. Each pitfall and success will update the Web3 community’s knowledge of how to construct a long-term sustainable system of ordering the relationships between tokenholders and their rights.\n\n*Moving Forward*\n\nFor those who are looking to design governance systems for their own projects, it is worthwhile to observe Optimism’s governance process as it proceeds. The Optimism Collective combines the learnings of the last few years of DAO design and adds new structures that may succeed or fail. As you observe Optimism’s experiment, as with your own experiments, watch for whether its structure progresses in line with its mission. See whether the balance of power remains stable or whether power collects too heavily in one place. Consider whether the community takes advantage of the opportunity to experiment with different structures, and whether the experiments result in tangible actions based on discrete findings.", "timestamp": 1654279931, "digest": "bjA8cQKssBxOTHYaVAbstu2xdH0FSoeUS-0qFG9rBfQ", "contributor": "0x367B4bDf414Df673Df0129838ebfB9913147427F"}

The most important thing to understand here is the path of the cyber attack – its vector. Let's take a closer look.\n\nСheck out my recent article:\n\n[https://officercia.mirror.xyz/VCUaozkvMw1CSaNm3VnafrDLX4dwEjDIQo6qSOIbO8o](https://officercia.mirror.xyz/VCUaozkvMw1CSaNm3VnafrDLX4dwEjDIQo6qSOIbO8o)\n\n\n---\n\n### Example No. 1 - RAT & Social Engineering\n\nLet’s [take an hypothetical situation](https://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap#problem-20) in which your computer gets infected with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) virus. One of two things may happen. If the attack was carried out by a rookie hacker (i.e a lamer) then he likely orchestrated a wide massive attack without a target in mind. He can steal some information on you like your browser cookies and then sell it.\n\nThe second option is that this was a direct attack. The hackers made a phishing page on your router, through which you could enter your password (poisoning of the DNS server). To prevent this type of attack, you ideally need to separate your machines and networks. You should also check certificates.\n\nHere is an example of a very dangerous cyber attack on your crypto wallet:\n\n![Source: researchgate.net/publication/339224082_A_Taxonomy_of_Social_Engineering_Defense_Mechanisms](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ETiPKc18AhScO65MJBgxQ.png?height=380&width=663)\n\n1. Your computer gets infected by malware with a [crypto clipper](https://twitter.com/officer_cia/status/1491920415387574275).\n2. Let us say you want to send money from your crypto account to your friend.\n3. When you attempt to copy and paste your friend’s crypto, ETH or BTC address, the clipper will substitute your friend’s address with a generated one that looks a lot like your friend’s (starts and ends with the same characters).\n4. Thus, instead of sending crypto to your friend’s account you actually direct the money directly into the hacker’s account.\n\nConsider checking the entire address of your addressee’s wallet before you click Send.\n\nSophisticated crypto criminals will throw at you a mix of attack vectors. It could be ​​a Social Engineering vector, plus phishing and a classic malware. They might even attempt a[ physical attack](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks/blob/master/README.md)!\n\n\n---\n\n### Example No. 2 - The Troll and the Knight\n\nLet us take Jane who is a diligent employee at her company. Information about Jane is publicly available on her social networks. Some sensitive information about her might have even been revealed in some leak, such as the 2014 Yahoo Mail user account information breach. Generally, she is no different from you or us. So far, so good.\n\nBut then, a troll shows up and starts stalking her around the social networks, writing hurtful comments, for example. He expands his cyberbullying to others in Jane’s company, bringing distress to his victims.\n\nEven at this stage, the attack has done enough damage to [cripple the culture of openness](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339224082_A_Taxonomy_of_Social_Engineering_Defense_Mechanisms) inside the company.  Employees may stop sharing personal information or speaking candidly about problems for fear of ridicule or retaliation.\n\nJane continues to suffer the troll's attacks in silence. If Jane blocks the troll’s account, he will make another. If he knows her address, multiple pizza deliveries may suddenly arrive at her door. It is no life.\n\nAt this point in our story, in comes John. He is a stranger but, he too, has a public account and has suffered from the actions of this same troll as evident from attacks on his page. He makes Jane a proposition for cooperation on how to stop the attacks. He says he knows a way to silence the troll.\n\nSure he knows the way. The Knight to the Rescue and the Evil Troll are one and the same person. The troll’s trick was to establish an emotionally supportive bond with someone who was experiencing pain. John created a condition where Jane is now more likely to follow John’s seemingly innocent suggestion. She may click on a URL link or open a file sent to her. She might even come out and meet John.\n\nThis story may end badly for Jane. A potential scam by John should have been stopped at the beginning – at the stage when the [target got recruited](https://telegra.ph/How-crypto-gets-stolen-06-21).\n\n![Source: arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00132.pdf ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l9XR9d-MtVAOOoxo3BJbI.png?height=507&width=1600)\n\nAre there any good guidelines to follow so that we do not end up in Jane’ position?\n\n1. The piece of advice “don't let strong emotions influence your actions” applies well for investing into stocks or when choosing a life partner. It can be your first rule in the digital world playground.\n2. If you get scammed, do not lose heart. One thing victims often tell us after being defrauded is “I can’t believe I was so stupid.” Scams happen to the best among us. Evolutionary psychology tells us that we have been wired by evolution to trust other humans for the purpose of our survival. This is why any exploitation of this strong evolutionary adaptation is particularly painful to us.\n3. If you are in a managerial role, make sure your employees aren't sick, tired or go hungry at work. When employees are physically or emotionally weakened, they become vulnerable to psychological influence.\n4. If you work a lot with files, particularly PDFs, you can use these protective [measures](https://twitter.com/officer_cia/status/1516440538999922694).\n5. While you may be wary of third parties trying to steal your information, you should also[ watch out for insider threats](https://cryptosec.info/checklist/), such as negligent employees and disgruntled workers.\n6. We recommend that you follow these [25 rules](https://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap) to safeguard yourself from nefarious Internet scammers. The first [10 rules](https://github.com/OffcierCia/Crypto-OpSec-SelfGuard-RoadMap) on the list relate to personal security, and the rest to corporate security.\n\nExploitation of love or anger happens less often because the scammer would need to maintain a psychological connection with the victim, requiring skill, time and familiarity with the target. In our situation the scammer exploited the victims' fear. What is more, in order for this attack to succeed the victim had to be rushed.\n\n![Source: www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404816300268](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Bxeg3Is6OjmYgm3IfYp0q.png?height=356&width=659)\n\nA skillful social engineer will not give the victim much time to think, and will always press for urgency. This is the first thing to pay attention to – If you are rushed to give out sensitive information (or any information at all, for that matter), it is a good time to pause.\n\nThe second point to note is that when you find yourself in a similar situation, do not try to solve the problem by yourself. Ask a friend, a frequent contributor to your favorite Discord server or a moderator of any well-known DAO. Good people want to help. Get a second opinion.\n\nSometimes scammers just want to get dirt on the victim or de-anonymize the target.   Often, however, sophisticated cyber exploits can come coupled with either a malware injection or a phishing attack, or some other surprise.\n\nYes, it seems like it is a veritable minefield over there.

Let us say you want to send money from your crypto account to your friend.\n3. When you attempt to copy and paste your friend’s crypto, ETH or BTC address, the clipper will substitute your friend’s address with a generated one that looks a lot like your friend’s (starts and ends with the same characters).\n4. Thus, instead of sending crypto to your friend’s account you actually direct the money directly into the hacker’s account.\n\nConsider checking the entire address of your addressee’s wallet before you click Send.\n\nSophisticated crypto criminals will throw at you a mix of attack vectors.

Information about Jane is publicly available on her social networks. Some sensitive information about her might have even been revealed in some leak, such as the 2014 Yahoo Mail user account information breach. Generally, she is no different from you or us. So far, so good.\n\nBut then, a troll shows up and starts stalking her around the social networks, writing hurtful comments, for example. He expands his cyberbullying to others in Jane’s company, bringing distress to his victims.\n\nEven at this stage, the attack has done enough damage to [cripple the culture of openness](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339224082_A_Taxonomy_of_Social_Engineering_Defense_Mechanisms) inside the company.  Employees may stop sharing personal information or speaking candidly about problems for fear of ridicule or retaliation.\n\nJane continues to suffer the troll's attacks in silence. If Jane blocks the troll’s account, he will make another. If he knows her address, multiple pizza deliveries may suddenly arrive at her door. It is no life.\n\nAt this point in our story, in comes John. He is a stranger but, he too, has a public account and has suffered from the actions of this same troll as evident from attacks on his page. He makes Jane a proposition for cooperation on how to stop the attacks. He says he knows a way to silence the troll.\n\nSure he knows the way. The Knight to the Rescue and the Evil Troll are one and the same person. The troll’s trick was to establish an emotionally supportive bond with someone who was experiencing pain. John created a condition where Jane is now more likely to follow John’s seemingly innocent suggestion. She may click on a URL link or open a file sent to her.

{"id": "M1Fc8rSEh7pPvBZwKKZGFDsuORDYjtHoGWOIOA-wNws", "title": "Ursula 3: An Interview with Hannah Whitaker", "body": "By **[Kristyna Archer](https://twitter.com/KristynaArcher)**\n\nHannah Whitaker’s body of work, *Ursula 3* examines our relationship with technology and digital servantry in contemporary life. Working meticulously in the studio between both analog and digital tools, Whitaker engages in a process of world-building around the development of a character named Ursula. As a continuation of an existing body of work, in this new series Whitaker incorporates special effects lighting, silhouettes, rear projection and fabricated sets to evoke a more established language of the Ursula lineage. She continues to push the exploration of gender stereotypes, AI, digital consent, and dehumanization. Whitaker is challenging the ubiquitous public domain of female bots and servants and highlights their consequences, damage, and complexities as we usher Ursula into a synthetic universe.\n\n![Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/72oxJvdzDLQ-xbp5ZwCen.png?height=444&width=1280&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: This series, *Ursula 3*, is an extension of your previous bodies of work featuring the same character. She is a female form, obscured in silhouette, against celestial, sci-fi inspired luminous backdrops, exploring the ever-present gender bias found in an increasing era of digital servants, AI, and sex-bots. In your new Obscura commissioned series, you overtly cover her form with futuristic, iridescent gloves, a hood, and a turtleneck, almost as if you were trying to unsex her image. Was this an attempt to see if you could in fact make her less objectified and perhaps more human?** \n\n**WHITAKER:** With their hard lines and geometric clarity, I think of the works as alluding to a graphic perfection that is ultimately undermined by all the dust and hairs of actual life. I think of Ursula similarly. She has a lovely profile and a sympathetic face and a long, skinny physique. In many ways, she adheres to conventional beauty standards and invokes an ideal form. But there is also something very strange and alien about her. (I’m referring now to Ursula, not Karen, who does an amazing job of embodying the character.) \n\nWhile Ursula clearly points to a physical ideal, to me, she has also always been and continues to be completely devoid of sex. Her expressions are calm and composed and her movements mechanical. I think of her as bloodless. So the reflective garments are in keeping with this. It’s not really about covering her form as her form is never really visible to begin with. But the garments, in accentuating her gestures, can create the sense of seeing her even if you still never really are able to.\n\n**ARCHER: I'm fascinated by the processes you have used to create Ursula’s universe. Rather than sketching out your compositions in the physical world, I read you design the rough final image in photoshop and then bring it to life with analogue processes, hand-cut masks, and layered exposures on 4x5 film. It feels purposefully disruptive, and in a way that is bold and irreverent. I’d love to hear more about the ‘why’ behind your process.** \n\n**WHITAKER:** The process that you’re referring to applies to older work of mine. Those works were multiple exposures shot on 4x5 film through hand-cut masks that I inserted into the camera. This allowed me to only expose parts of the film at a time. I could create images that looked constructed in a way that conventional photographs cannot. At the same time, it was still a completely optical process, so in spite of the planning and control, unforeseen details were always recorded. I liked the way that process allowed me to have an idea for an image and to then make it exactly. The process made me feel like a machine–I had to follow my own instruction sets for how to make the work. It was with those works that I initially developed the Ursula character. Her face and various body parts appeared silhouetted and often repeated in a mechanical and detached manner. \n\n**ARCHER: ​​As an artist that works in a very controlled manner, how do you allow for any happy accidents to occur during the process?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** I started shooting conventional photographs again a few years ago and doing so allows for many more opportunities for chance. I still do sketches and plan things out but the planning takes a different form than when I was making the film works. Now I procure props, set materials, and garments. I research source imagery and lighting techniques. I buy or rent photographic equipment I need. Karen Meléndez, the model I like to work with, doesn’t live in NYC so when she is in town I shoot tons of work at once. Even with all the planning, it’s really hard to predict what will work when I’m actually shooting. Sometimes the photographs are essentially exactly how I planned and sometimes what I planned doesn’t work at all and the photograph will hinge on some unexpected gesture or lighting accident. \n\n![Ursula 3 #15 (left) and #6 (right) by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kf-r-IsXPNSJuiRISTEbu.jpg?height=1024&width=1516&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: In the large scope of the project, AI and female voice assistants risk dulling our capability of intimacy. To me, these technologies become transactional and devoid of meaningful connection. Is this numbness of the digital era present in your work? Do we ever develop an empathy towards Ursula, or is the truth that one can not?  Are we in fact dehumanizing her, or is she actually a fully dimensional being, as you stated?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Certainly Hollywood thinks so! The notion of a fabricated woman who is created to serve her maker has been in the public domain for a very long time. The story of the female form untethered from the complexities of an actual human being has been told many times. In Ovid’s Metamorphoses, written 8 AD, Pygmalian hates women so he carves one out of ivory and falls in love with her. I’m not sure how it relates to intimacy but ubiquity of passive and servile female digital assistants certainly reinforces damaging stereotypes. It seems clear from the innumerous similar stories of fabricated women combined with the impulse to gender digital servants as female, that women, in general, are dehumanized in the popular imagination as a matter of course. I’m not sure why Ursula would be any different. One reason I want those tangles of hairs and glints of light on her eyes in the photographs is to insist on her humanity. \n\n**ARCHER: In respect to the NFT avatar-driven PFP way of life where anonymity is the superpower, it creates this contrast of alluring mystery and inherent disconnection. Is this something you are exploring with the silhouettes?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Yes but only in the broadest possible sense. The work responds to a generalized sense of alienation and misrepresentation relating to technology and contemporary life. Online there’s difficulty in knowing people and being known in meaningful ways, particularly for women. Conversely there’s also a fear of being known, and there is a constant battle to protect oneself from unspecified threats. The work points to the complex relationship that human beings have with technology, which is constantly changing, and which no one could possibly fully understand in the moment.\n\n**ARCHER: There are elements of Trompe-l’oeil and illusion in your analogue-native work that manipulate the viewers’ perceptions and are intrinsic to your process. Do you feel this highlights the opportunities for disruption of non-digital-native art, like the impact of photography in the NFT space, as we continue to become more immersed in these digitally native worlds?** \n\n**WHITAKER:** I don’t tend to think of photography as not native to the digital space, though I get what you mean. I suppose NFTs started out with digitally-created images and photo NFTs came later. But photography has always been a huge part of the images trafficked online and a major driver of technology in hardware, software, and social media. Are the digitally native worlds interested in the veracity of an image? I don’t know! \n\nI personally like to make my work in-camera, not out of a sense of superiority to digitally native imagery, but because I think my work is more complex when the real world inserts itself into it. Karen is always trying to smooth out her hair when we’re shooting but I love seeing a tangle of hairs recorded in high photographic resolution. That way the photographs contain more than just my own ideas. \n\n![Ursula 3 #26 (left) and #14 (right) by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hPmwS2HeVrAtVvMxLLT4u.jpg?height=1024&width=1516&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: Is there any deeper meta interconnection between the idea of “right-click & save” of images profierating the internet, on top of being a series of images of a digital servant? The use and abuse of power runs deep. Abuse meaning, the stealing of image use without proper credit exists in web2. Now *Ursula 3* will be on-chain and can not be modified or detached from her owner.**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Right-clicking and saving images doesn’t bother me actually. I would be happy to have someone like my image enough to save it so they can look at it regularly. I mean, obviously I don’t want them to pass it off as their own or make money off it, but just saving it I’m okay with. To me, right clicking and saving isn’t an inherently abusive act and doesn’t undermine the commodity value of an NFT. But the connection that you’re drawing is interesting. I do think that the notion of a digital servant is related to wanting to have power over someone. Being able to abuse someone without any consequences comes with it. Maybe it relates to wanting to be able to do what you want all the time without constraint. \n\n![Ursula 3 #8 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LNjyacFH_R2nmMcbrDtcg.jpg?height=1024&width=758&size=medium)\n\n**ARCHER: Do you see a conversation occurring between the Ursula character and these new contexts of blockchain, NFTs, and the metaverse that she now occupies?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** While I wasn’t thinking at all about NFTs when I developed the character, she certainly makes a lot of sense on a conceptual level in the NFT space. I mean, the project does touch directly on the question of how to represent people in the digital sphere.  \n \n\n**ARCHER: In your artist’s statement, you mention you “usher her \\[Ursula\\] into a synthetic universe,” as if releasing her into the wild of the metaverse. Her release or escape into web3 is quite ironic in its evolution. If web3 is supposed to decentralize and flatten previous hierarchical societal constructs, can this new synthetic universe of the blockchain actually free her because inherently web3 hopes to disrupt and remove bureaucracy? Perhaps in effect she will be more free here than the gender bias that has been instilled previously?** \n\n**WHITAKER:** I would be shocked if Web3 will ultimately be spared the structural biases of the real world but I love your optimism! There’s a lot I don’t understand about Web3 but I don’t think anything made by people who developed consciousness in a flawed world (ie everyone) can really escape it. \n\n**ARCHER: With NFT culture highlighting digital, generative AI-driven art like nothing ever before in history, have these new technological paradigms inspired any thoughts on how you might introduce this into your own work? Have you ever considered implementing an actual AI process or forms of automation into your work processes that removes some of your control as an artist?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** The 4x5 film process started out as a way to remove some of my control as an artist. At the time I was thinking a lot about John Cage’s chance operations. But now that I’m working with a digital camera making conventional photographs, I don’t see myself relinquishing control any time soon. I’m really interested in photography as a medium–it’s history, its influence on culture, its power to seduce. In that sense, I’m still very interested in making my own specific kind of photographs. I want the images I make to comment on contemporary life but also relate to some of the images that I drew from– like album art from the 70s, or fashion photography from the 60s, or posters from the 80s.  \n \n\n**ARCHER: Apparently, Siri got her name after the Norwegian name that means \"beautiful woman who leads you to victory,\" can I ask why “Ursula?” \n WHITAKER:** I have also heard that Siri was named for a specific woman – a Norwegian meteorologist named Siri Kalvig. I chose the name Ursula for a few reasons. I liked that it's a name that feels both old fashioned and futuristic at the same time. It’s also frightened by a lot of associations– the witch from the Little Mermaid, Ursula le Guin the feminisit sci-fi writer, and Ursula Andress a Swiss actress/bond girl/sex symbol. The triangulation of the villain, sci-fi, and iconic beauty seemed about right.\n\n![Ursula 3 #11 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ccTQu0yBF57_7XnR0gVSk.jpg?height=1024&width=758&size=medium)\n\n**ARCHER: What are you most excited about with what the blockchain offers for artists and what Obscura is doing in partnership with your future path?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Obscura basically funded the making of a ton of new work with no strings attached. I had total creative freedom. That’s never happened to me before in my entire career and it felt amazing. In general what I’m most excited about is the availability of new models of living and working for artists. I still operate in and appreciate the legacy art world but few would argue that it serves all artists well. I’m all for the creation of new income streams for artists, new opportunities for discourse about art, and new forms of community-building.\n\n![Ursula 3 #22 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dgllesZkOdyFkx1KNY4D6.jpg?height=1024&width=758&size=medium)\n\n**To view the full collection** of Hannah Whitaker’s Obscura Commissioned drop:\n\n[https://obscura.io/collections/hannah-whitaker](https://obscura.io/collections/hannah-whitaker)\n\n**To view other NFT works** of the artist: \n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/hannahwhitaker-ursula](https://opensea.io/collection/hannahwhitaker-ursula)\n\n \n **Follow Hannah Whitaker** on Twitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/_hannahwhitaker](https://twitter.com/_hannahwhitaker)\n\n \n **Follow Obscura DAO** on Twitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/obscuradao](https://twitter.com/obscuradao)\n\n \n \n\nJoin the **Obscura Discord:**\n\n[https://discord.com/invite/obscura](https://discord.com/invite/obscura)\n\n \n Want to **Contribute to the Obscura DAO?**\n\n[https://airtable.com/shrgZ0BhGA0stsqik](https://airtable.com/shrgZ0BhGA0stsqik)\n\n \n Want to **Partner with Obscura?**\n\n[https://airtable.com/shr0qRDmFLro3V7i9](https://airtable.com/shr0qRDmFLro3V7i9)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654280192, "digest": "4hdx1pzHlhOTzQ5aAGCi0e7eQQtXu9r1hU1NpLD2K9I", "contributor": "0xFda746F4C3f9F5A02b3E63ed6d0eBBc002d1f788"}

One of two things may happen. If the attack was carried out by a rookie hacker (i.e a lamer) then he likely orchestrated a wide massive attack without a target in mind. He can steal some information on you like your browser cookies and then sell it.\n\nThe second option is that this was a direct attack. The hackers made a phishing page on your router, through which you could enter your password (poisoning of the DNS server). To prevent this type of attack, you ideally need to separate your machines and networks. You should also check certificates.\n\nHere is an example of a very dangerous cyber attack on your crypto wallet:\n\n![Source: researchgate.net/publication/339224082_A_Taxonomy_of_Social_Engineering_Defense_Mechanisms](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ETiPKc18AhScO65MJBgxQ.png?height=380&width=663)\n\n1.

Let us say you want to send money from your crypto account to your friend.\n3. When you attempt to copy and paste your friend’s crypto, ETH or BTC address, the clipper will substitute your friend’s address with a generated one that looks a lot like your friend’s (starts and ends with the same characters).\n4. Thus, instead of sending crypto to your friend’s account you actually direct the money directly into the hacker’s account.\n\nConsider checking the entire address of your addressee’s wallet before you click Send.\n\nSophisticated crypto criminals will throw at you a mix of attack vectors.

Information about Jane is publicly available on her social networks. Some sensitive information about her might have even been revealed in some leak, such as the 2014 Yahoo Mail user account information breach. Generally, she is no different from you or us. So far, so good.\n\nBut then, a troll shows up and starts stalking her around the social networks, writing hurtful comments, for example. He expands his cyberbullying to others in Jane’s company, bringing distress to his victims.\n\nEven at this stage, the attack has done enough damage to [cripple the culture of openness](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339224082_A_Taxonomy_of_Social_Engineering_Defense_Mechanisms) inside the company.  Employees may stop sharing personal information or speaking candidly about problems for fear of ridicule or retaliation.\n\nJane continues to suffer the troll's attacks in silence. If Jane blocks the troll’s account, he will make another. If he knows her address, multiple pizza deliveries may suddenly arrive at her door. It is no life.\n\nAt this point in our story, in comes John. He is a stranger but, he too, has a public account and has suffered from the actions of this same troll as evident from attacks on his page. He makes Jane a proposition for cooperation on how to stop the attacks. He says he knows a way to silence the troll.\n\nSure he knows the way. The Knight to the Rescue and the Evil Troll are one and the same person. The troll’s trick was to establish an emotionally supportive bond with someone who was experiencing pain. John created a condition where Jane is now more likely to follow John’s seemingly innocent suggestion. She may click on a URL link or open a file sent to her. She might even come out and meet John.\n\nThis story may end badly for Jane. A potential scam by John should have been stopped at the beginning – at the stage when the [target got recruited](https://telegra.ph/How-crypto-gets-stolen-06-21).\n\n![Source: arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00132.pdf ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l9XR9d-MtVAOOoxo3BJbI.png?height=507&width=1600)\n\nAre there any good guidelines to follow so that we do not end up in Jane’ position?\n\n1.

Much more reliable (and fun) when compared to shilling in DMs.\n\n### Scream:\n\nNot literally, but through your art.\n\nSales still happen in bear markets, but not as frequently. So you need to ensure you’re standing out as much as you can while staying authentic to you and your art.\n\nHow do you do that?\n\n* Create something so mind-blowing that people feel like they HAVE to own it,\n* Continue to connect with artists & collectors alike,\n* market the piece in a unique way - Example: Turn your drop into a multi-part story, with each piece sharing more and more detail.\n\n### Parting Thoughts:\n\nSo how can a bear market change your life?\n\nTo put things simply, if you spend the next 3 months networking with as many artists and collectors as possible on Twitter, creating incredible art and making noise about the work you produce, there’s no doubt you can change the quality of your relationships, art and community.", "timestamp": 1654281592, "digest": "dcBnr1DHOlEb4YBuRZmK8RSoa_chLgCA8p6fYhed_tw", "contributor": "0x17998ba12753252df498cc7840512B5a4CAE6476"}

{"id": "dLpQdwKhzgn-UOqWMyjr4roua1XXJl2TT3RO8tPvMFc", "title": "Ursula 3: An Interview with Hannah Whitaker", "body": "By **[Kristyna Archer](https://twitter.com/KristynaArcher)**\n\nHannah Whitaker’s body of work, *Ursula 3* examines our relationship with technology and digital servantry in contemporary life. Working meticulously in the studio between both analog and digital tools, Whitaker engages in a process of world-building around the development of a character named Ursula. As a continuation of an existing body of work, in this new series Whitaker incorporates special effects lighting, silhouettes, rear projection and fabricated sets to evoke a more established language of the Ursula lineage. She continues to push the exploration of gender stereotypes, AI, digital consent, and dehumanization. Whitaker is challenging the ubiquitous public domain of female bots and servants and highlights their consequences, damage, and complexities as we usher Ursula into a synthetic universe.\n\n![Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/72oxJvdzDLQ-xbp5ZwCen.png?height=444&width=1280&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: This series, *Ursula 3*, is an extension of your previous bodies of work featuring the same character. She is a female form, obscured in silhouette, against celestial, sci-fi inspired luminous backdrops, exploring the ever-present gender bias found in an increasing era of digital servants, AI, and sex-bots. In your new Obscura commissioned series, you overtly cover her form with futuristic, iridescent gloves, a hood, and a turtleneck, almost as if you were trying to unsex her image. Was this an attempt to see if you could in fact make her less objectified and perhaps more human?** \n\n**WHITAKER:** With their hard lines and geometric clarity, I think of the works as alluding to a graphic perfection that is ultimately undermined by all the dust and hairs of actual life. I think of Ursula similarly. She has a lovely profile and a sympathetic face and a long, skinny physique. In many ways, she adheres to conventional beauty standards and invokes an ideal form. But there is also something very strange and alien about her. (I’m referring now to Ursula, not Karen, who does an amazing job of embodying the character.) \n\nWhile Ursula clearly points to a physical ideal, to me, she has also always been and continues to be completely devoid of sex. Her expressions are calm and composed and her movements mechanical. I think of her as bloodless. So the reflective garments are in keeping with this. It’s not really about covering her form as her form is never really visible to begin with. But the garments, in accentuating her gestures, can create the sense of seeing her even if you still never really are able to.\n\n**ARCHER: I'm fascinated by the processes you have used to create Ursula’s universe. Rather than sketching out your compositions in the physical world, I read you design the rough final image in photoshop and then bring it to life with analogue processes, hand-cut masks, and layered exposures on 4x5 film. It feels purposefully disruptive, and in a way that is bold and irreverent. I’d love to hear more about the ‘why’ behind your process.** \n\n**WHITAKER:** The process that you’re referring to applies to older work of mine. Those works were multiple exposures shot on 4x5 film through hand-cut masks that I inserted into the camera. This allowed me to only expose parts of the film at a time. I could create images that looked constructed in a way that conventional photographs cannot. At the same time, it was still a completely optical process, so in spite of the planning and control, unforeseen details were always recorded. I liked the way that process allowed me to have an idea for an image and to then make it exactly. The process made me feel like a machine–I had to follow my own instruction sets for how to make the work. It was with those works that I initially developed the Ursula character. Her face and various body parts appeared silhouetted and often repeated in a mechanical and detached manner. \n\n**ARCHER: ​​As an artist that works in a very controlled manner, how do you allow for any happy accidents to occur during the process?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** I started shooting conventional photographs again a few years ago and doing so allows for many more opportunities for chance. I still do sketches and plan things out but the planning takes a different form than when I was making the film works. Now I procure props, set materials, and garments. I research source imagery and lighting techniques. I buy or rent photographic equipment I need. Karen Meléndez, the model I like to work with, doesn’t live in NYC so when she is in town I shoot tons of work at once. Even with all the planning, it’s really hard to predict what will work when I’m actually shooting. Sometimes the photographs are essentially exactly how I planned and sometimes what I planned doesn’t work at all and the photograph will hinge on some unexpected gesture or lighting accident. \n\n![Ursula 3 #15 (left) and #6 (right) by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kf-r-IsXPNSJuiRISTEbu.jpg?height=1024&width=1516&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: In the large scope of the project, AI and female voice assistants risk dulling our capability of intimacy. To me, these technologies become transactional and devoid of meaningful connection. Is this numbness of the digital era present in your work? Do we ever develop an empathy towards Ursula, or is the truth that one can not?  Are we in fact dehumanizing her, or is she actually a fully dimensional being, as you stated?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Certainly Hollywood thinks so! The notion of a fabricated woman who is created to serve her maker has been in the public domain for a very long time. The story of the female form untethered from the complexities of an actual human being has been told many times. In Ovid’s Metamorphoses, written 8 AD, Pygmalian hates women so he carves one out of ivory and falls in love with her. I’m not sure how it relates to intimacy but ubiquity of passive and servile female digital assistants certainly reinforces damaging stereotypes. It seems clear from the innumerous similar stories of fabricated women combined with the impulse to gender digital servants as female, that women, in general, are dehumanized in the popular imagination as a matter of course. I’m not sure why Ursula would be any different. One reason I want those tangles of hairs and glints of light on her eyes in the photographs is to insist on her humanity. \n\n**ARCHER: In respect to the NFT avatar-driven PFP way of life where anonymity is the superpower, it creates this contrast of alluring mystery and inherent disconnection. Is this something you are exploring with the silhouettes?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Yes but only in the broadest possible sense. The work responds to a generalized sense of alienation and misrepresentation relating to technology and contemporary life. Online there’s difficulty in knowing people and being known in meaningful ways, particularly for women. Conversely there’s also a fear of being known, and there is a constant battle to protect oneself from unspecified threats. The work points to the complex relationship that human beings have with technology, which is constantly changing, and which no one could possibly fully understand in the moment.\n\n**ARCHER: There are elements of Trompe-l’oeil and illusion in your analogue-native work that manipulate the viewers’ perceptions and are intrinsic to your process. Do you feel this highlights the opportunities for disruption of non-digital-native art, like the impact of photography in the NFT space, as we continue to become more immersed in these digitally native worlds?** \n\n**WHITAKER:** I don’t tend to think of photography as not native to the digital space, though I get what you mean. I suppose NFTs started out with digitally-created images and photo NFTs came later. But photography has always been a huge part of the images trafficked online and a major driver of technology in hardware, software, and social media. Are the digitally native worlds interested in the veracity of an image? I don’t know! \n\nI personally like to make my work in-camera, not out of a sense of superiority to digitally native imagery, but because I think my work is more complex when the real world inserts itself into it. Karen is always trying to smooth out her hair when we’re shooting but I love seeing a tangle of hairs recorded in high photographic resolution. That way the photographs contain more than just my own ideas. \n\n![Ursula 3 #26 (left) and #14 (right) by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hPmwS2HeVrAtVvMxLLT4u.jpg?height=1024&width=1516&size=large)\n\n**ARCHER: Is there any deeper meta interconnection between the idea of “right-click & save” of images profierating the internet, on top of being a series of images of a digital servant? The use and abuse of power runs deep. Abuse meaning, the stealing of image use without proper credit exists in web2. Now *Ursula 3* will be on-chain and can not be modified or detached from her owner.**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Right-clicking and saving images doesn’t bother me actually. I would be happy to have someone like my image enough to save it so they can look at it regularly. I mean, obviously I don’t want them to pass it off as their own or make money off it, but just saving it I’m okay with. To me, right clicking and saving isn’t an inherently abusive act and doesn’t undermine the commodity value of an NFT. But the connection that you’re drawing is interesting. I do think that the notion of a digital servant is related to wanting to have power over someone. Being able to abuse someone without any consequences comes with it. Maybe it relates to wanting to be able to do what you want all the time without constraint. \n\n![Ursula 3 #8 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LNjyacFH_R2nmMcbrDtcg.jpg?height=1024&width=758&size=medium)\n\n**ARCHER: Do you see a conversation occurring between the Ursula character and these new contexts of blockchain, NFTs, and the metaverse that she now occupies?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** While I wasn’t thinking at all about NFTs when I developed the character, she certainly makes a lot of sense on a conceptual level in the NFT space. I mean, the project does touch directly on the question of how to represent people in the digital sphere.  \n \n\n**ARCHER: In your artist’s statement, you mention you “usher her \\[Ursula\\] into a synthetic universe,” as if releasing her into the wild of the metaverse. Her release or escape into web3 is quite ironic in its evolution. If web3 is supposed to decentralize and flatten previous hierarchical societal constructs, can this new synthetic universe of the blockchain actually free her because inherently web3 hopes to disrupt and remove bureaucracy? Perhaps in effect she will be more free here than the gender bias that has been instilled previously?** \n\n**WHITAKER:** I would be shocked if Web3 will ultimately be spared the structural biases of the real world but I love your optimism! There’s a lot I don’t understand about Web3 but I don’t think anything made by people who developed consciousness in a flawed world (ie everyone) can really escape it. \n\n**ARCHER: With NFT culture highlighting digital, generative AI-driven art like nothing ever before in history, have these new technological paradigms inspired any thoughts on how you might introduce this into your own work? Have you ever considered implementing an actual AI process or forms of automation into your work processes that removes some of your control as an artist?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** The 4x5 film process started out as a way to remove some of my control as an artist. At the time I was thinking a lot about John Cage’s chance operations. But now that I’m working with a digital camera making conventional photographs, I don’t see myself relinquishing control any time soon. I’m really interested in photography as a medium–it’s history, its influence on culture, its power to seduce. In that sense, I’m still very interested in making my own specific kind of photographs. I want the images I make to comment on contemporary life but also relate to some of the images that I drew from– like album art from the 70s, or fashion photography from the 60s, or posters from the 80s.  \n \n\n**ARCHER: Apparently, Siri got her name after the Norwegian name that means \"beautiful woman who leads you to victory,\" can I ask why “Ursula?” \n WHITAKER:** I have also heard that Siri was named for a specific woman – a Norwegian meteorologist named Siri Kalvig. I chose the name Ursula for a few reasons. I liked that it's a name that feels both old fashioned and futuristic at the same time. It’s also frightened by a lot of associations– the witch from the Little Mermaid, Ursula le Guin the feminisit sci-fi writer, and Ursula Andress a Swiss actress/bond girl/sex symbol. The triangulation of the villain, sci-fi, and iconic beauty seemed about right.\n\n![Ursula 3 #11 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ccTQu0yBF57_7XnR0gVSk.jpg?height=1024&width=758&size=medium)\n\n**ARCHER: What are you most excited about with what the blockchain offers for artists and what Obscura is doing in partnership with your future path?**\n\n**WHITAKER:** Obscura basically funded the making of a ton of new work with no strings attached. I had total creative freedom. That’s never happened to me before in my entire career and it felt amazing. In general what I’m most excited about is the availability of new models of living and working for artists. I still operate in and appreciate the legacy art world but few would argue that it serves all artists well. I’m all for the creation of new income streams for artists, new opportunities for discourse about art, and new forms of community-building.\n\n![Ursula 3 #22 by Hannah Whitaker, Obscura Curated Commission.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dgllesZkOdyFkx1KNY4D6.jpg?height=1024&width=758&size=medium)\n\n**To view the full collection** of Hannah Whitaker’s Obscura Commissioned drop:\n\n[https://obscura.io/collections/hannah-whitaker](https://obscura.io/collections/hannah-whitaker)\n\n**To view other NFT works** of the artist: \n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/hannahwhitaker-ursula](https://opensea.io/collection/hannahwhitaker-ursula)\n\n \n **Follow Hannah Whitaker** on Twitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/_hannahwhitaker](https://twitter.com/_hannahwhitaker)\n\n \n **Follow Obscura DAO** on Twitter:\n\n[https://twitter.com/obscuradao](https://twitter.com/obscuradao)\n\n \n \n\nJoin the **Obscura Discord:**\n\n[https://discord.com/invite/obscura](https://discord.com/invite/obscura)\n\n \n Want to **Contribute to the Obscura DAO?**\n\n[https://airtable.com/shrgZ0BhGA0stsqik](https://airtable.com/shrgZ0BhGA0stsqik)\n\n \n Want to **Partner with Obscura?**\n\n[https://airtable.com/shr0qRDmFLro3V7i9](https://airtable.com/shr0qRDmFLro3V7i9)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654281697, "digest": "4hdx1pzHlhOTzQ5aAGCi0e7eQQtXu9r1hU1NpLD2K9I", "contributor": "0xFda746F4C3f9F5A02b3E63ed6d0eBBc002d1f788"}

{"id": "MyWGLVM16IQR4VcWCszy6Fis1EdIkBrcN4dCH1jx_uo", "title": "Studying the Optimism Collective", "body": "***Disclosure: You may already be a winner of the*** ***[$OP token sweepstakes](https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/check). I am serving as a delegate for the Optimism Token House.***\n\nThis week Optimism dropped the $OP token, initiating Optimism Governance. Optimism’s governance system presents an exciting opportunity to study the latest thinking in governance design and helps us focus on shaping the next era of Web3 through its focus on public goods. With the launch of the token, Optimism created the Optimism Collective, an ecosystem that will govern the distribution of public goods funding derived from the revenue the protocol generates. The Optimism Collective is governed by three bodies: the Token House (holders of $OP), the Citizens’ House (select NFT holders), and the Foundation. Optimism’s structure is notable for its balance of power between the three governing bodies, the use of multiple voting styles (token-weighted and one-person, one-vote), and the Collective’s commitment to experimentation.\n\n*What is Optimism?*\n\nOptimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is an optimistic rollup: it is optimistic, because it assumes transactions submitted to it by users are valid; it is a rollup, because it sequences transactions off of Ethereum and periodically submits a merkle root of the transactions to Ethereum to create a resulting state change. Given that Optimism’s sequencer does not ensure the same security as Ethereum, Optimism creates a dispute period after its sequencer publishes a batch of transactions, during which a party can challenge a state change with a fault proof (for a reward) which will prevent the state change from being committed to Ethereum. Optimism is the first layer 2 to achieve EVM equivalence, meaning that there is no difference between how smart contracts are executed on L2 and L1, which makes deployment on Optimism easier.\n\n*The Optimism Collective — Mission*\n\nThe Optimism Collective is guided by a vision of “sustainably fund\\[ing\\] those public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond.” In essence, Optimism is devoting protocol revenue tokenholders and trusted stewards of the community to fund public goods projects that create compounding value for Optimism and eventually Web3 and broader society. The Collective was created with a view toward making public goods creation profitable, meaning “impact=profit.” The Collective seeks to achieve its mission by funding public goods both proactively and retroactively. Proactive funding encourages innovation and risk-taking in the pursuit of public goods; retroactive funding ensures that impactful projects are rewarded.\n\n*Balance of Power*\n\nOptimism seeks to balance the short-term and long-term views of the community by balancing power between the Token House, the Citizens’ House, and the Foundation.\n\n![Optimism Governance Overview](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*V9XR86iMDooYoZBg.jpeg)\n\nThe Token House is entrusted to make determinations about project incentives, protocol upgrades, and the appropriation of treasury funds to the Foundation. By leveraging the collective knowledge of the Token House, the Collective is able to improve the predictive power of its grants and adjust to the specific needs of the Optimism community. The democratic aspect of the Token House ensures that the users of the protocol have representation in determining the future of the protocol’s mission and function.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will focus on retroactive public goods funding. Citizens will be selected from the community; their citizenship is non-transferrable. By selecting individuals who have demonstrated value to the Optimism ecosystem, the Collective will increase the likelihood that retroactive funding represents true value provided to the community. Having a consistency of identity creates continuity in criteria and makes long-term decision-making possible. The method for selecting Citizens will be determined by the Foundation in consultation with the Token House.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation is the steward of the Collective. It oversees the administration of governance, allocates treasury assets (including the distribution of $OP), vetoes malicious proposals, and has the power to amend the Constitution. The Foundation has many stabilizing powers for the community, yet its capabilities remain in check by the Token House. The Token House can remove directors from the Foundation and veto changes to the founding documents that would materially impair tokenholders’ rights.\n\n*Mixed Voting*\n\nThe Token House and Citizens’ House have different forms of voting to suit different functions. The Token House votes on a token-weighted basis. As in any token-weighted system, Token House voting is susceptible to plutocratic concentration of power and voter apathy. The Token House permits tokenholders to delegate their votes to stewards who have made public commitments to act as stewards for the Collective. Delegation may mitigate the power of individual holders who have high concentrations of power by enabling smaller holders to pool their votes through a delegate. Delegation also ensures that there are members of the community who are dedicated to participating in governance, mitigating the chance that small groups can collude to pass self-interested proposals with a quorum.\n\nThe Citizens’ House will operate through a one-person, one-vote system. Presuming that Citizens are chosen based on their specific insights and dedication to the ecosystem, the one-person, one-vote structure is sensible: newly minted citizens will have equal footing with incumbents for decision-making. In addition to preventing plutocratic domination, a non-transferrable one-person, one-vote system will avoid the volatility that accompanies rapid transfer of liquid governance tokens.\n\nBringing a token-weighted system together with a one-person, one-vote system creates a balance between the short-term and the long-term as well as between the prospective and retroactive. Both Houses come together to determine the Optimism network parameters, which affects the balance between transaction volume on the Optimism network and funding supply for retroactive public goods funding. This balance keeps the present and future health of the protocol fairly represented: tokenholders are not unfairly called upon to subsidize large-scale infrastructural projects, while citizens have a voice in projecting long-term funding needs to improve the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n*Experimentation*\n\nOptimism’s Working Constitution is brief, but the first principle is “a commitment to experimentation.” Projects that have a need for a complex beginning also have a need for flexibility. At the point of initiation, the Optimism community can only match an understanding of their needs with governance theory and the knowledge of how other DAOs have succeeded and failed. To ensure the success of the governance process, the community needs to commit to a flexible system in order to test theory with community-specific data. By focusing on experimentation, Optimism will collect important data on what principles and rules best suit the mission of funding public goods and use that data to create a better fit between the Collective’s mission and its procedure.\n\nEarly experimentation mitigates path-dependency. By maintaining a commitment to testing theories, the community encourages honesty about the value of the governance systems it tries. A collective mindset of flexibility also encourages the community to innovate, as the cost of failure is lowered and the value of the data collected is high. If early rules are rigid, systems may proceed despite inefficiencies and flaws in the early design, and the longer the flaws linger, the more difficult it becomes to remedy them in the future.\n\nThe results of the Collective’s experiments will be public goods in themselves. Optimism will be highly visible given its critical role in scaling Ethereum, which means that its governance process will be on display for other communities that are working hard to discover the appropriate mission-governance fit. Each pitfall and success will update the Web3 community’s knowledge of how to construct a long-term sustainable system of ordering the relationships between tokenholders and their rights.\n\n*Moving Forward*\n\nFor those who are looking to design governance systems for their own projects, it is worthwhile to observe Optimism’s governance process as it proceeds. The Optimism Collective combines the learnings of the last few years of DAO design and adds new structures that may succeed or fail. As you observe Optimism’s experiment, as with your own, watch for whether its structure progresses in line with its mission. See whether the balance of power remains stable or whether power collects too heavily in one place. Consider whether the community takes advantage of the opportunity to try different structures, and whether the experiments result in the community taking tangible actions based on their findings.", "timestamp": 1654281869, "digest": "bjA8cQKssBxOTHYaVAbstu2xdH0FSoeUS-0qFG9rBfQ", "contributor": "0x367B4bDf414Df673Df0129838ebfB9913147427F"}

{"id": "igRYV_EDSE4XLXIh3fm69Jcl06onrEBIbnhKJKVohQc", "title": "UST - not so Stablecoin ", "body": "## Introduction\n\nThis May wasn’t specifically good for the **Web3.0** space. Market took a good hit, portfolios came down, people lost money. All this happened within a week. No - one before had imagined that a blockchain can be attacked and forced to be halted.\n\nWell that’s what happened to the **TERRA** network. Its native token LUNA lost 100% of its value.\n\n![LUNA Market history over past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_a6dKTArZU9hpPtcX9tbV.png?height=382&width=488)\n\n## Stable Coins\n\nThere are two types of currencies in blockchain, one that you want to increase in prices i.e. the native tokens so that you can gain high ROI’s e.g. Ether, BTC etc. Other one is stablecoins, you want these to stay near 1$ i.e. their initial pegging. They are programmed in such a way that they stay low. They are considered the safe channel if you want to go long on your assets. For a better understanding, you can relate them with government securities in terms of traditional trading, they don’t offer high ROI’s but profits are guaranteed even if they are low. There are many such tokens as Tether’s USDT, or US Center government’s USDC.\n\n## UST - LUNA\n\nLike USDT, USDC, **TERRA** network has its own stablecoin UST. Now unlike other stablecoins, which are backed up by liquidity in form of real money in the banks, UST is an algorithmically stable coin. Do Kwon, founder of the Terra network, designed this token. As per the theory, UST is 1:1 pegged to Terra’s LUNA. It means UST holders can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA by burning the UST and minting LUNA.\n\n## Attack Phase - 1\n\nUST doesn’t have any other utility other than Terra’s most popular [Anchor Protocol](https://www.anchorprotocol.com/#). Anchor offers 20% yield for deposits, this is far more than any other protocol. But this deal is only effective to the UST, no other stablecoins, be it USDC, USDT.\n\nAs per April end, 72% of all the UST was locked into Anchor, estimated around 14 billion dollars.\n\nImagine a bank offering 20% interest on your deposits, obviously everyone would go to that bank and earn that pretty money. That’s what happened with Anchor, as the time passed, the number of lenders increased, but the number of borrowers kept decreasing, in this case a proposal was drawn and it was clear that those pretty 20% interest rates were not going to stand.\n\nAfter hearing the news, people started pulling their locked UST out from Anchor.

He often flashes in our season reviews, and if you missed his interview for [NewsBTC](https://newsbtc.xyz/article/an-interview-with-ivica-simatovic-oaziz-dao-contributor-bin18369), here it is.\n\nIvica is a true veteran of the blockchain industry: he rocks more than a decade of blockchain experience and 20+ years of development experience. He has such eminent companies as Sony, Mercedes, and Telecom on his career list. He launched his first GameFi project over 10(!) years ago. Ivica is an ardent fan of decentralization, a wizard of blockchain development and a true master of his craft.\n\nIvica commented on his reasons to join Oaziz:\n\n> OazizDAO was a concept that inspired me. A form of sociocracy that enables growth with an interactive exchange of values, transactions and information.\n\nAlthough the concept of Oaziz is still being developed, Ivica already knows what it will look like:\n\n> Oaziz should become a place for people to get together, share ideas, build, create and feel somewhat like their virtual home.\n\nWith Ivica, you can be sure that the technical part of Oaziz is in the right hands.\n\nP.S. And if you want to hear from Ivica more often - just follow him on [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/IvicaSimatovic) :)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/emOJcHq9J3ZufYJ1h1Z9D.jpeg?height=408&width=408)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654282200, "digest": "L_TqLbJVqjWlySeKnro9MbDPGE9ZoUqzLpYmQ6cuD0Y", "contributor": "0xCdA29ff08464a66b1c8437e7dE780c1d02907688"}
{"id": "kruaili-Ypsws-rOuAeLrt3S0U8TQh6UH-12oqtVpfk", "title": "UST- not so Stablecoin ", "body": "## Introduction\n\nThis May wasn’t specifically good for the **Web3.0** space. Market took a good hit, portfolios came down, people lost money. All this happened within a week. No-one before had imagined that a blockchain can be attacked and forced to be halted.\n\nWell that’s what happened to the **TERRA** network. Its native token LUNA lost 100% of its value.\n\n![LUNA Market history over past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_a6dKTArZU9hpPtcX9tbV.png?height=382&width=488)\n\n## Stable Coins\n\nThere are two types of currencies in blockchain, one that you want to increase in prices i.e. the native tokens so that you can gain high ROI’s e.g. Ether, BTC etc. Other one is stable-coins, you want these to stay near 1$ i.e. their initial pegging. They are programmed in such a way that they stay low. They are considered the safe channel if you want to go long on your assets. For a better understanding, you can relate them with government securities in terms of traditional trading, they don’t offer high ROI’s but profits are guaranteed even if they are low. There are many such tokens as Tether’s USD, or US Center government’s USDC\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n## UST-LUNA\n\nLike USDT, USDC, **TERRA** network has its own stable-coin UST. Now unlike other stable-coins, which are backed up by liquidity in form of real money in the banks, UST is an algorithmically stable coin. Do Kwon, founder of the Terra network, designed this token. As per the theory, UST is 1:1 pegged to Terra’s LUNA. It means UST holders can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA by burning the UST and minting LUNA.\n\n## Attack Phase -1\n\nUST doesn’t have any other utility other than Terra’s most popular [Anchor Protocol](https://www.anchorprotocol.com/#). Anchor offers 20% yield for deposits, this is far more than any other protocol. But this deal is only effective to the UST, no other stable-coins, be it USDC, USDT.\n\nAs per April end, 72% of all the UST was locked into Anchor, estimated around 14 billion dollars.\n\nImagine a bank offering 20% interest on your deposits, obviously everyone would go to that bank and earn that pretty money. That’s what happened with Anchor, as the time passed, the number of lenders increased, but the number of borrowers kept decreasing, in this case a proposal was drawn and it was clear that those pretty 20% interest rates were not going to stand.\n\nAfter hearing the news, people started pulling their locked UST out from Anchor. Since there is no other use of UST, people started getting out of the Terra network\n\n[Anchor Docs](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/)\n\n## Attack Phase -2\n\nNow to exit UST, there are two options, one- the inbuilt burn and mint mechanism, where one can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA, Second option is stable-coin exchange, Curve Finance.\n\nCurve provides liquidity pools for stable coins, same existed for UST too, specifically (UST+3crv pool).\n\nWhen people took out their UST they started swapping it into the curve pool. It increased the amount of UST and decreased the amount of other stable-coins, resulting in the destabilization of the pool.\n\nTo make things worse, at least one individual dumped about $85 Million worth UST tokens, and exchanged them for USDC. This created an imbalance in the pool. Now to tip the scales back, according to the protocols, Anchor starts offering UST at a discounted price. This was the initial step in de-pegging of UST.

{"id": "4c6_BlsNR4GfjCcKPcb03y0FZzsyfYL1jj43Wd5Q8zQ", "title": "和王慧文在他的李想车里聊了90分钟，contain Web3", "body": "Twitter: @26x14eth\n\n因为我没能及时做核酸，原本定在望京某酒店的聚点临时变到了车里。\n\n这次会面的由头是Multicoin Capital的Founding Partner Kyle Samnai在Twitter上的一条内容，关于Airbnb模式的Web3机会。Kyle在Twitter上急呼相关模式的Web3创业者，并带着鲜明的积极和拥抱。王慧文的看法是：Airbnb是上一波O2O里面经营复杂度相对较低的，但online的业务模式似乎比offline更容易被Web3改造。\n\n今年年初开始，王慧文在即刻上发出了多条与Web3有关的动态，被业界视为是能帮助Web3进行资本破圈的又一大佬。但见面之后，他告诉我，近期对Web3的关注度已经有所减缓。一是，没有想明白X to Earn或NFT的付费场景除了游戏之外还有哪些；另一个是，很多Defi产品在除了提供流动性之外缺乏价值和算法支撑。“号称算法稳定币的Luna，它的算法到底在哪？”他尝试重复且微笑的发问，我知道他显然已有自己的答案。\n\n“我在Web3还没有怎么投资”，他身体斜向背椅靠去，“我也没有团队，就我一个人”。数月前，他刚从香港回来，在那见过很多做Defi的朋友，未来也会保持见人的频次。而最近，他开始把更多的注意力从Web3转向了股票的二级市场。\n\n“现在的中概股，如果从未来5年回头来看，会产生很多的十倍股，A股也有很大的机会。”比如拼多多，最低的时候居然才300多亿美金市值（当前660亿美金左右）。王慧文认为，如今的中概股从情绪面已经很难有更差的时候了。\n\n我们也聊了滴滴，私有化和再上市的猜想。聊了美团当年做打车为何没有继续，聊了美团为什么没逢低买下滴滴。这些话题因为敏感度就不在此展开了。但王慧文对滴滴的后市判断是乐观的，我们也都希望滴滴能好。\n\n说到腾讯。它可能是另一个逻辑，不必苛求和追问腾讯下一个十年的增长引擎是什么，但它至少是一个安全的存在，拥有腾讯股票就像买了一个长期的保险类产品。类似的逻辑还有美团。美团提供民生相关的基础设施和服务，对就业率的吸纳和贡献很大。王慧文说，自己至今还没怎么卖过美团股票，之前网上传闻的卖股很大部分是和税收处理相关，“有王兴在那，他相当于起到了一个很好的基金经理，我为什么要卖？”\n\n王慧文看好当前二级市场的估值洼地，但他也并没有进行怎样的主动型配置。他解释说，股市仍然属于风险型资产，而他本人不是一个风险敞口较宽的风格。这样的风格也体现在早前他对理想汽车的投资上。本来当时是想拿出1亿美金投三家（李想、小鹏、蔚来），但因为个人资金很大程度拴在美团股票上，没有那么多钱，最后的几千万美金是借来投理想。而三家里面选择理想，很大程度是出于更信任这个人。王慧文说，小鹏的软件算法非常厉害，李斌也合作过，但李想给我的感觉最稳。而这个“稳”，也非常匹配汽车这条赛道。\n\n可能现在再从0开始做（造车），时机会有些被动，手机厂商入局会怎样，还需要观察观察。不过，这并不影响他对新能源赛道宏观层面的热切信心。“新能源汽车的未来格局将由中、美来主导。”为什么不看好日本？日本在历史上经常押错路线，这和日本的岛内资源、内生经济有很大关系，它不像美国，也不像中国，日本的很多决策似乎也并不以“第一性原理”作为优先级。\n\n王慧文认为，日本选氢燃料做新能源车，是一个错误的路径，也许你技术更稍显优越性，但现在人家锂电池已经跑起来了，规模和势能已经起来了，产业链怎么会选择你？这不是一个技术唯一驱动的业态。一个长线的投入，过早入局，或许是一个深坑。\n\n与一些科技大佬不同，王慧文并不是一个特斯拉信徒，尽管他看好特斯拉的成长空间仍有数倍。在他看来，美国式教育让美国创业者更懂得如何使用PR和营销，这和美国的资源工具优厚有关，调配资源的能力对美国人来说，比执行力有更为重要的作用和效率。尽管Elon Musk很优秀，但他在PR上的优势远远高于他在产品、技术上的相对优势。\n\n此外，媒体舆论也过于放大了算法的作用。王慧文认为，在相当长一段时间内，新能源车的核心仍然在于“电动”本身，后面才是算法。所以你看，比亚迪就很厉害。\n\n“退休”之后，王慧文说自己最大的乐趣和精力是在于对“宏观”的思索和琢磨。“你有没有听过芒格的Lollapalooza理论？”，“你是否知道文明和野蛮的区分？”，“我很多香港和新加坡的朋友认为普京是野蛮人，那你觉得他算是文明还是野蛮？”，“达里奥曾预测过美国会发生内战，尽管我认为可能性很低，但你有没有想过如果美国内战，这个会是怎样的方式打起来呢？”\n\n我极大的乐趣在倾听他对于“宏观”的思辨和相对独立的逻辑体系。他拨弄着墨镜，时而戴上时而摘下，不变的是淡淡而狡黠的微笑。想起一位老美团的朋友曾评价他说，清华电子系的老王如果当年转攻哲学也一样能将对手摧枯拉朽，他的“王式哲学”自成一派。而我仍能记住之前在微信上的一次对话，他说“做业务，要讲究新人做老事，老人做新事”，这句话一晃5年了，至今让我深刻。", "timestamp": 1654282570, "digest": "CXqu0kg9AVMQUiIIb9FYsrYNYQmaxlMH9_xWokw-mEE", "contributor": "0x1eAf4d367b7a4685160857e6e99b6325DE22fEEc"}

{"id": "J3r6OHUtbfjJlHrTFMUCwXIVEjzx8_80ARyJAw90noM", "title": "UST - not so Stablecoin ", "body": "## Introduction\n\nThis May wasn’t specifically good for the **Web3.0** space. Market took a good hit, portfolios came down, people lost money. All this happened within a week. No - one before had imagined that a blockchain can be attacked and forced to be halted.\n\nWell that’s what happened to the **TERRA** network. Its native token LUNA lost 100% of its value.\n\n![LUNA Market history over past month](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_a6dKTArZU9hpPtcX9tbV.png?height=382&width=488)\n\n## Stable Coins\n\nThere are two types of currencies in blockchain, one that you want to increase in prices i.e. the native tokens so that you can gain high ROI’s e.g. Ether, BTC etc. Other one is stablecoins, you want these to stay near 1$ i.e. their initial pegging. They are programmed in such a way that they stay low. They are considered the safe channel if you want to go long on your assets. For a better understanding, you can relate them with government securities in terms of traditional trading, they don’t offer high ROI’s but profits are guaranteed even if they are low. There are many such tokens as Tether’s USDT, or US Center government’s USDC.\n\n## UST - LUNA\n\nLike USDT, USDC, **TERRA** network has its own stablecoin UST. Now unlike other stablecoins, which are backed up by liquidity in form of real money in the banks, UST is an algorithmically stable coin. Do Kwon, founder of the Terra network, designed this token. As per the theory, UST is 1:1 pegged to Terra’s LUNA. It means UST holders can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA by burning the UST and minting LUNA.\n\n## Attack Phase - 1\n\nUST doesn’t have any other utility other than Terra’s most popular [Anchor Protocol](https://www.anchorprotocol.com/#). Anchor offers 20% yield for deposits, this is far more than any other protocol. But this deal is only effective to the UST, no other stablecoins, be it USDC, USDT.\n\nAs per April end, 72% of all the UST was locked into Anchor, estimated around 14 billion dollars.\n\nImagine a bank offering 20% interest on your deposits, obviously everyone would go to that bank and earn that pretty money. That’s what happened with Anchor, as the time passed, the number of lenders increased, but the number of borrowers kept decreasing, in this case a proposal was drawn and it was clear that those pretty 20% interest rates were not going to stand.\n\nAfter hearing the news, people started pulling their locked UST out from Anchor. Since there is no other use of UST, people started getting out of the Terra network\n\n[Anchor Docs](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/)\n\n## Attack Phase - 2\n\nNow to exit UST, there are two options, one - the inbuilt burn and mint mechanism, where one can swap 1 UST for 1$ LUNA, Second option is stablecoin exchange, Curve Finance.\n\nCurve provides liquidity pools for stable coins, same existed for UST too, specifically (UST+3crv pool).\n\nWhen people took out their UST they started swapping it into the curve pool. It increased the amount of UST and decreased the amount of other stablecoins, resulting in the destabilization of the pool.\n\nTo make things worse, at least one individual dumped about $85 Million worth UST tokens, and exchanged them for USDC. This created an imbalance in the pool. Now to tip the scales back, according to the protocols, Anchor starts offering UST at a discounted price. This was the initial step in de - pegging of UST. This eventually resulted in the drowning of LUNA in the market.\n\n![Transaction showing deposit of $85 Million worth UST](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8i8MY1SsFCuLvCtGvj89p.png?height=390&width=600)\n\n## Attack Phase - 3\n\nEvery blockchain has a safe guard which steps in at the moment of crisis. Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) was Terra’s shield in this case. It dumped non - UST stable - coins worth approximately $216 Million into the curve pool to regain the balance. This technique did work for sometime but the prices continued to degrade as people continued to get out of Terra. Panic played a crucial role in the plummeting of the Market, traders/investors lost their trust in Terra.\n\nNow to compensate for the loss in the portfolios, people started selling their other assets to absorb the shock. This resulted in the falling of the market altogether.\n\nDo Kwon had already thought about any incident of such kind, some time later after launching UST, he started buying Bitcoin as safe reserves. But those reserves were not enough to compensate for the destruction.\n\nThis kind of attack forced the blockchain to halt, a decision collectively taken by all the nodes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter the whole month of analyzing , it’s safe to say that we still are at a very early stage, there’s a lot to learn, a lot to unravel, a lot to study. One has to take every step very cautiously because it’s real money at stake here.", "timestamp": 1654283263, "digest": "Xup_PA8A5ZGz0bA_7TKb8sp8GgSPuJWSQ-qn00aSnWI", "contributor": "0xC6036B8c3F911f936b661a075CFAA4B802b75cc3"}

Таксите за транзакции на L1 са много високи от месеци и има по-голяма спешност да се направи всичко необходимо, за да се улесни преминаването към **RollUps** в цялата екосистема.\n\n* *Ниски такси*\n\nРазбиването (sharding) на данни ще отнеме значително време, за да завърши внедряването, но **Rollups вече са тук**. **EIP-4844** може да намали сборните такси с порядък и да позволи на **Ethereum** да остане конкурентоспособен и ефикасен, без да жертва децентрализацията.\n\n### 🏄🏾‍♀️Откриване на нови хоризонти🏄🏾‍♀️\n\nИма много завладяващи възможности, които могат да бъдат активирани от **Dank-sharding**. Имайте впредвид, че не съм Blochchain Dev разработчик или технически запознат с кода на **EIP-4844**, но спекулирам с това, което може да излезне като позитив! :\n\n1. С функцията **crLists (обяснена във видеото),** потенциално бихте могли да имате незабавни предварителни потвърждения за транзакции от L1. (Няма повече чакане на блокове за потвърждение!)\n2. Отваря възможността за надграждане на текущия слой за изпълнение на Ethereum (execution layer) да бъде към RollUp. Първо като **Optimistic Rollup** с доказателства за липса на измами, в крайна сметка като прикрепен **ZkRollup с zkEVM**.\n3. Така че, като се има предвид всичко по-горе, вие трябва да се замислите за различните нови възможности, които не сте обмисляли преди. Ето една възможност : може ли това да отвори възможността за **[кръстосано набиране (cross-chain)](https://zkmurton.substack.com/p/multi-chain-vs-cross-chain)** съвместимост между множество ZKR?!\n\n🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️ Това със сигурност е възможно между множество вериги в една и съща **ZKR** мрежа (например **StarkNet L3s**) - но какво ще стане, ако е между **StarkNet L3 и zkSync L2**? Могат ли предварителните потвърждения на **crList** да позволят на **ZKR** да свързват транзакции една върху друга, като всички потвърждават в рамките на един и същи блок?\n\nЗа да бъде ясно, има много работа, която трябва да се свърши, но се смята, че това наистина е ***най-вълнуващото нещо, което се е случило в протоколите на блокчейн***, откакто са въведни за Rollups и извадката за наличност на данни(data availability sampling). Повече инфо: [ТУК](https://polynya.medium.com/danksharding-36dc0c8067fe)\n\n\n---\n\nВъпреки, че на теория Dank-sharding звучи напълно разумно, все още има доста работа да бъде отметната.

Otherwise, it was business as usual at Rehash DAO, and we’ll share some of the highlights below.\n\n## Two new podcast episodes this week 🎙️\n\nKeeping with our Tuesday/Thursday podcast release schedule, we published two new episodes this week featuring conversations with Gary Sheng from Dream DAO and Civics Unplugged and Dayo Adeosun from Glass Protocol.\n\n[https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1531309120166342657?s=20&t=p81WsqZNRp76fLNgvRZqhg](https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1531309120166342657?s=20&t=p81WsqZNRp76fLNgvRZqhg)\n\n### Rehash Episode 2: Regenerating Communities & Our Planet w/Gary Sheng \n\nGary is the founder of Dream DAO and Civics Unplugged and is passionate about applying regenerative models to web3. He talks about what “regen” means to him, why inclusivity in web3 is important, what a solarpunk future looks like, and why he believes gen z can make the largest impact on web3.\n\n[https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1531674643441909761?s=20&t=p81WsqZNRp76fLNgvRZqhg](https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1531674643441909761?s=20&t=p81WsqZNRp76fLNgvRZqhg)\n\nYou can listen to the full episode on [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/regenerating-communities-our-planet-w-gary-sheng/id1620436349?i=1000564654708), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2a8RI2AmCjxjvRPorczwVR?si=srkWC7tTSYqSQSp7IAJBKw), or wherever you get your podcasts.

These workstreams are accessible (read & write) to NFT holders on Discord and viewable (read only) by the public. \n\nThis week, we’ve been focused on working through some of the questions we posed last week, especially with regards to membership. One question we’ve heard from you the most is with regards to contribution.\n\n### What are some ways in which people can contribute to the DAO today?\n\nFor our existing NFT holders, the two main ways you can contribute today are:\n\n* **Promotion** - creating summary threads, RTing, posting on reddit, creating their own promo audio/video clips, pulling quotes from episodes, \"good Twitter shilling\", leading Discord discussions, etc. to get more people talking about Rehash\n* **Process** - helping us nail down our governance and org structure, document processes, and stay organized\n\nFor people who missed our [crowdfund](https://rehash.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0xa3659D161757C6c88e667CC022B93bcCfa01dB27) and want to contribute, we’ll be releasing a typeform in the next week that you can fill out to get onboarded to Rehash DAO. \n\n## Meme of the Week 😂\n\nOur meme of the week features Matt Gould, our guest on Episode 1 of Season 2. Check it out below:\n\n[https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1532078507765153793?s=20&t=p81WsqZNRp76fLNgvRZqhg](https://twitter.com/rehashweb3/status/1532078507765153793?s=20&t=p81WsqZNRp76fLNgvRZqhg)\n\nWe like the memes!\n\nIf you have any feedback or ideas, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9mrS8PmRh4) and chat with us!\n\nSee you next week ✌️", "timestamp": 1654283431, "digest": "BhzReux0Uf9v9NWYLibgwtlxbeyDz8kskfJPgwe8Tgc", "contributor": "0xcEd09CCFc82b091195bdE04E6Cd65374518E7b95"}

As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery, farm, hash processing, and soon-to-launch retail of award-winning legacy products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks.

We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654284014, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem : Removing the Gatekeepers in Tech, Finance, & Culture**\n\nHighly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Creating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption. Information, data security, and their applications are essential for business optimization and transparency. Although there are many ERP solutions for the industry already, our governance will be centered around cannabis supply chain and DeFi dApps that utilize NFT-based SKU’s to generate active product data and create on-chain interactions that comply with ESG metrics, paving the way for global regulations and the future of the cannabis space.\n\nDeveloping Horticulture Public Goods : BIPOC Horticulture Initiative, Open-Source Library of Genetics, Strains and Phenos, Regenerative Farming Methods & Techniques, Cannabis Production, Processing, Entheogenic Cultivation, Medicinal Protocols, and a Community-Practitioner Directory\n\nCommunity-Governance over the liquidity, yield-farming, and major-user decisions in the tokenization of HASH DAO.\n\nHASH DAO Governance is the future of the industry standard, and to do this we will start by partnering with one successful Emerald Triangle, Northern California craft cannabis-brand with community-staking of its future scaling of operations and expanding a compilation of automation protocols through smart contracts.\n\n**ON-CHAIN SUPPLY NFTs + ACTIVE INVENTORY TRACKING + CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS = Web3 Point of Sale (PoS)**\n\n**World’s First Cannabis DAO Founded On**:\n\nBIPOC-equity and engineered around community-development governed by craft cannabis operators, backed by IRL projects.\n\n**On-Chain Protocols + Smart Contracts = The Automated Horticulture of Tomorrow**\n\nCreating a future:\n\n* Geared to the love and cultivation of the plant and Mother Earth\n* Onboarding BIPOC leaders and creatives onto the blockchain\n* Compensating intellectual property proportionally to fulfill smart contracts\n\n> **HASH DAO = Power Back in Your Hands**\n\nReinvention of the Horticulture Supply Chain and Data Distribution via smart contracts that allow for automation and help individuals to create ownership over community-led projects, intellectual property, digital assets, and dApps.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M6C2p0sNHx37p783TEv9D.jpg?height=822&width=1125)\n\n**First Wins for HASH DAO**\n\n> “Community Ownership of Physical and Digital Assets”\n\nMinting a multi-tiered HASH DAO NFT with the top governance tier going for $10 K, raising a total of $11.5 M for an initial $HASH treasury. As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery, farm, hash processing, and soon-to-launch retail of award-winning legacy products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks.

Specifically, these Victorian-themed tuckshops and sweet connoisseurs, plucked from two hundred years prior and plopped in the middle of a high street that doesn’t quite know how to welcome its new tenant. One of the sweet shops near me plasters ‘Toys, Trains, Treats” on dated storefront panelling; it’s the shop you thought your grandparents went to when they were young, except the steam trains on sale are battery powered.\n\nThis wasn’t just a Baader–Meinhof [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion), where upon seeing something once you perceive it everywhere. During the first year of the pandemic, an extra [73](https://www.mylondon.news/news/uk-world-news/i-visited-londons-new-dangerous-22961908#:\\~:text=73%20more%20sweet%20shops%20in%20the%20uk%20compared%20with%202020) sweetshops popped up in the UK, net, according to the Local Data Company. That’s not a huge number, but it’s pretty significant given the broader lockdown context; the total number of clothing shops fell by 1,236 in the same period[1](#footnote-1). The shop near me was set up in September ‘21. It begs the question: what’s so special about sweet shops?\n\nI had spent my Saturday morning at Waterstones buying some books, at the sweet shop questioning the shop assistant, and now I’m writing about it on Substack. In days gone by, I would have bought my physical items at Sainsbury’s and, in comparison to today, where I have my Substack and my main [website](https://www.leonasskau.co.uk/), all my digital publishing would be through the same technology stack, probably Wordpress.\n\nI mean, you get what I’m saying, despite the weird animojis, right? ([HelloDorking](https://twitter.com/HelloDorking/status/1305174859287326721/photo/1))\n\nSweets are nice, but the real difference is the existence of a shop that will focus all of its resources on their specific niche product. I bought some weird caramel chocolate flakes that defy description, but they were excellent. I certainly paid a premium, but next time I want sweets, I’ll go there again, because *they know their product*; I just bought what the shop assistant recommended. At Waterstone’s, I picked up [Train Dreams](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/13/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review) because I told the manager I was after contemporary fiction; I use Substack because it’s built for writers[2](#footnote-2). **What makes these businesses special is that they serve *niche markets in which they can give people much deeper value.***\n\n![I mean, you get what I’m saying, despite the weird animojis, right? (HelloDorking)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xRINH9-26W7ZvCggFpXtm.jpeg?height=2438&width=3024)\n\n## Unbundling into niches\n\nBundling and unbundling are [not new concepts](https://hbr.org/1999/03/unbundling-the-corporation). It’s a pretty simple convection model: you start with a business, over time you add more products, services, and features, and then you get bloated, do everything ‘kinda well’, until a niche competitor comes along and does *one* of your services *really really well*, and bit by bit you get pieced apart. The [complexity convection](https://every.to/divinations/complexity-convection-765851) is a pattern that cannot be unseen. \n\nPeople have observed this happening to our contemporary digital landscape for about a decade, beginning in practice much earlier. Craigslist was [unbundled](https://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/345941486/the-spawn-of-craigslist-like-most-vcs-that-focus) into many things, including Reddit, which is now being [unbundled](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit?s=r) into many more things, like Nextdoor. In the language of [a16z](https://a16z.com/2019/09/11/platforms-verticals-unbundling/), the famed tech investors: platforms get unbundled into verticals, which turn into platforms, at which point the cycle resumes, and all of a sudden I’ve turned into a strategy writer[3](#footnote-3). \n\nI’m not the first to herald this unbundling in the physical world either. Peter Day [wrote](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=Economy%2C%20%20almost%20a,speed%20and%20efficiency.) an excellent essay predicting “the heartbeat economy, almost a concierge approach to customers,” in 2013:\n\n> `“This would be a worryingly intimate relationship for many businesses, but one which might provide a new kind of rewarding marketplace if they dared to be far closer to their customers' individuality.”`\n\nHe wrote about it in the BBC, but today he would write on his own blog.\n\nMy real contribution is to note that this challenges why unbundling and bundling happens at all. The main idea behind why we sway between bundled and unbundled products is the [underlying technology](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling#:\\~:text=a%20lot%20of%20it%20is%20based%20on%20the%20underlying%20technology%20change). Marc Andreesen, co-founder of a16z and of [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)), the first web browser, talks through the concept of the newspaper:\n\n> `“The newspaper bundle, the idea of this slug of news and sports scores and classifieds and stock quotes that arrives once a day was a consequence of the printing plant, of the distribution network for newspapers using trucks and newsstands, and the famous newspaper delivery boy. That newspaper bundle was based on the distribution technology of a time and place.`\n>\n> `When the distribution technology changed with the internet, there was going to be the great unwind, and then the great rebundle, in the form of Google and Facebook and Twitter.”`\n\nThis is certainly true: we could only put [live events on Twitch](https://youtu.be/TCPjk8Tpb5c?t=1025) after network infrastructure made it cheap enough to broadcast live video around the world.\n\nBut it’s no coincidence that physical businesses are unbundling at the same time as digital ones, despite relying on different technologies, and often very little tech at all. Neither technology nor innovations built upon it come from magic: what consumers *actually want* plays a key role; today it’s driven by the niche market vibe shift.\n\nWhy? Well first, consumer demand fosters technological innovation. I took a cursory glance at solar panels [last month](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/podcast-discussion-negotiating-our?s=w#:\\~:text=we%E2%80%99re%20already%20on%20the%20way.%20solar%2C%20wind%2C%20fusion%2C%20geothermal%2C%20and%20hydrogen%20energy%20technologies%20have%20all%20advanced%20significantly%20even%20in%20the%20past%20decade.), where growing consumer demand and growing production have *induced* new technologies; if people hadn’t bothered to use streaming services in the early days, there wouldn’t have been the investment that made them possible at scale. Substack was built because its founders [believed](https://every.to/divinations/substack-s-ideology) writers wanted to offer readers deeper value in a specific niche - and that [readers would pay for it](https://twitter.com/hamishmckenzie/status/1532432557513404416) – not due to any new technologies, just due to the niche market vibe shift.\n\nSecond, even when this technological innovation happens, there is no rule commanding consumers to use every new use case that’s suddenly made possible. Google, Facebook, and Twitter all had to create new bundles that people actually wanted to use: do [Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B), [Google Answers](http://answers.google.com/answers/faq.html#:\\~:text=google%20answers%20was%20an%20experimental%20product%20for%20users%20to%20get%20help%20from%20researchers%20with%20expertise%20in%20online%20searching.), or [Google Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Notebook#:\\~:text=allowed%20users%20to%20save%20and%20organize%20clips%20of%20information%20while%20conducting%20research%20online) ring a bell?\n\n**I think the reason I’m seeing more sweetshops around is because of a niche market vibe shift. The technology for serving more niche communities has always existed, but now consumers actually want it. *But what does this mean?***\n\n\n---\n\nI have two quick points before we move on: why this insight is important and why this shift is happening.\n\nFirst, understanding that bundling and unbundling cycles sway partly due to social preferences, as well as technology, is important to understanding where these sways stop and start, and how to take advantage of them. If it’s true that people want more meaningful, participatory communities, that tells us a lot more about where the future is going than simply observing the entire possibility space opened up by new technologies. When I looked at those failed Google products, I got the impression that Google - founded by Stanford grads - originally sought to be a lot more academic than it is today, with tools for professional research and note-taking. We can understand that these products failed because they weren’t aligned with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, even though they were technically feasible.\n\nSecond, my quick take is that this shift has its roots in society’s search for reciprocal connection. The 21st century is probably the only century that will ever be worth calling ‘the internet century’ (by the 22nd the internet won’t be exciting anymore). Today’s internet is very uni-directional, with big influencers megaphoning to their followers[4](#footnote-4). But people also want to [belong ](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/about#:\\~:text=the%20sense%20of%20belonging%20that%20humans%20inherently%20desire)to something, and as I wrote a few months ago, building connections *[within](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/leading-movements-communicating-change?s=w#:\\~:text=so%20build%20connections-,within,-your%20movement)* your community makes it so much more fulfilling. You feel you’re really participating, and this is really why I go to the sweet shop. Society just invented the internet, and is searching for meaning. Also [G](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/great-recession-still-with-us/547268/).[F](https://www.bruegel.org/2018/10/ten-years-after-the-crisis-the-wests-failure-pushing-china-towards-state-capitalism/).[C](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227439075_THE_IMPACT_OF_THE_ECONOMIC_CRISIS_ON_CULTURE).\n\n![This is a great time to take a break, maybe stretch your legs, and share with a friend! (Kevin Huynh)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7pYdkgZ_QQytonD6G7z0-.webp?height=796&width=1456)\n\n\n---\n\nAnd now we’re back; great.\n\nThe rest of this essay is to explore how this shift is influencing culture. We can think pretty big about *all* the unbundling opportunities new technologies bring: in *[Life After Google](https://www.waterstones.com/book/life-after-google/george-gilder/9781621575764)*, Gilder points out that even money *could* be unbundled, though I don’t think this is on the cards. It’s possible, but consumers don’t actually want to unbundle money into a store of value, unit of account, and so forth. Very few communities are built simply around money as a tool; everyone will *not* become [currency traders](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/12/11/bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-web3-great-protocol-politics/#:\\~:text=everyone%20becomes%20a%20foreign-exchange%20trader); a niche can’t be built around something that everyone uses, and most people don’t care.\n\nI want to instead focus on culture, which people care a lot about, and is interesting for many further reasons. It interests me how great cultural contributions both capture some image of society whilst also moving it forward[5](#footnote-5). Culture is also beautifully adaptable and flexible and fluid, changing rapidly and exhibiting immense diversity of contribution and consumption: it’s a *collection of niches*. I expect this vibe shift to play out in culture very soon. (It goes without saying that this will occur on the internet.)\n\nThat idea of culture as a collection of niches deserves interrogating: culture is also something that we all share. And sure, there will continue to be big Instagram accounts and large supermarkets; shows and books that everyone talks about and events that unite the masses. But as Rex Woodbury notes: “[Celebrities like (Tom) Cruise are a dying breed](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/cultural-transmission-in-the-internet?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NTcwOTkyMTIsIl8iOiJlcTFDOSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDE2NzYxMywiZXhwIjoxNjU0MTcxMjEzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzg1MDAiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.pfK8o_nxyz7FIehX7-CkXaRKa-d0-3YhcJ1I1r_YRkg&s=r#:\\~:text=celebrities%20like%20cruise%20are%20a%20dying%20breed)”[6](#footnote-6). The 2020s will be defined by the “[long tail of creators](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/the-two-way-mirror-of-art-and-technology?s=w#:\\~:text=embolden%20the%20long%20tail%20of%20creators)”, each creating en mass for far smaller communities with much deeper engagement. In the 21st century, we will seek experiences that feel, in some important ways (and not all), totally and emphatically human — that’s why people love [eSports](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-watch-other-people-play-video?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDUxMzUyMzksIl8iOiJrK0hyQSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDIwNjQ5OSwiZXhwIjoxNjU0MjEwMDk5LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzMyOTk2Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.T5f6CkyK7SFpzLO3nZZ6U2Zudqkkf4npc9ZsqDnSqFg&s=r#:\\~:text=as%20totally%20and%20unabashedly%20human); we’re in the moment *with* the players. **For the hobbies and niches that we love, for which we’re far more than mere followers, we’ll find people serving that niche with dedicated communities built around them.**\n\n[Late Checkout](https://latecheckout.studio/about) is an agency that doesn’t deserve the negative tag associated with such companies[7](#footnote-7); they capture the situation perfectly:\n\n> “The old way of building products was to try and be everything to everyone. Products were chunky, bloated, and didn’t serve the individual or communities.”\n>\n> “People want to feel a connection to the products they use. They want the internet to feel human and alive again.”\n\nIt’s exciting to see people building the future, and culturally we’re going to see exactly this: **content will be built around niche and dedicated communities with genuine human connection**[8](#footnote-8).\n\n\n---\n\n## And thus the 1,000 True Fans thesis eventually manifests.\n\nIn 2008, Kevin Kelly wrote one of the most seminal contributions in culture tech. The founding editor-in-chief of Wired wrote that, in the internet age:\n\n> `“To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans.”`\n\nA thousand dedicated fans who love your niche. Sound familiar? \n\nSo what took so long?\n\nIt’s certainly the case that the technology of the era made this difficult. Kelly hoped that the internet would be the ultimate matchmaker. Bring the creators and the consumers online, and they will find each other. To an extent, they did, especially in the early days of the internet: in 2008, writing about 1000 True Fans looked sensible. But it was still pretty hard: you could publish your own content, but without mass-market services like Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube, that helped you discover, it was tough to find or be found.\n\nThe introduction of these services, monoliths to be, helped in one sense: it was a lot easier for people to find you on the internet. But the price for this matchmaking was almost everything: Facebook and Instagram take almost 100% of all the revenue creators see on their platforms; YouTube takes 45%; Spotify paid an average of merely £700 to each artist last year[9](#footnote-9). These monoliths do the matching, but make it virtually unaffordable to create in the first place.\n\nIt was a vibe shift, not a technological one, that struck the first blow to this impoverished paradigm. Twitch, Kickstarter, Patreon, Substack, amongst many others, are all services built for creators to cater for the dedicated fans of their niche; all built amidst the community-centric vibe shift born in the 2010s. Well before the 2020 crypto bull run, a16z heralded a [100 True Fans model](https://future.a16z.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/) in 2020[10](#footnote-10), arguing that this was made possible with even more niche services from Podia, Teachable, and Kajabi. (These companies *all* help people sell educational courses, which undermines the argument to an extent, but you only need 250 fans paying £20/$25 per month to earn \\~3x the average UK salary or [$75,000](https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html#:\\~:text=no%20matter%20how%20much%20more), so you get the picture.) **With the alignment of technology and the vibe, the impoverished paradigm of community-stricken creatorship is collapsing.**\n\n\n---\n\n### Blockchain is a game-changer for this dynamic\n\n*You’re reading on Mirror, so you probably know all this; you could easily skip to the next phrase in bold.*\n\nIn the early 2020s, new technologies like blockchain, distributed ledgers, and cryptocurrencies really came in vogue. A distributed ledger is triple-entry bookkeeping. [Double-entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping) bookkeeping was invented in medieval Italy: two parties to a transaction would both record it, giving you more data about your business and more verifiable figures, making it easier to trade and pursue enterprise.\n\nEight centuries later, distributed ledgers are triple-entry bookkeeping: as well as the seller and buyer, *every participant in the economy* makes a record of the transaction, and every participant is using the same, enormous, book. Blockchain is the technology of how you add to this book and run software with it, and cryptocurrency is one use case: the ledger essentially records how much currency you own, which everyone verifies. Obviously I’m simplifying, but I’ll refer to these technologies as ‘web3 techs’[11](#footnote-11).\n\nThe significance of blockchain becomes clear upon interrogating why Facebook, YouTube, *et al.* can take such high take rates on creators. One side is [discovery](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does#:\\~:text=no%20one%20finds%20a%20person%20on%20patreon%3B%20you%20go%20there%20after%20you%E2%80%99ve%20found%20them): you rarely *find* creators on Patreon. This happens, still, on big social networks. Everyone is on these platforms (well, not Facebook) and when you consume on these platforms frequently, they’re experts in figuring out what content you’ll click on next; big data, [Markov chains](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-markov-chains-50da3645a50d#:\\~:text=predict%20weather%20for%20days%20to%20come%2C%20based%20on%20what%20the%20current%20weather%20state%20is%20at%20the%20time), etc. There are some problems with this, mainly that you get served addictive content rather than niches that you want to engage deeply in, but generally they do this job pretty well, and web3 techs don’t hugely change this.\n\nBut there are a lot of platforms for discovery — this isn’t the competitive moat it once was. People use Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Pinterest, and much more, in addition to the discovery platforms we’ve called out above; as mentioned, most people have moved beyond Facebook. Creators could just move to whichever discovery network takes the smallest cut of their revenue. Apart from one thing: they can’t. Everything you’ve ever uploaded to Spotify and all the followers you’ve earnt on Insta: the discovery platform manages this, and you can’t take your community with you. So it’s impossible to leave without starting all over again. And hence discovery networks [squeeze](https://stratechery.com/2015/niches-problem-subscription-services/) creators for revenue.\n\nAnd hence, the game-changer. Because just like with your cryptocurrency, you can store your [writing](https://mirror.xyz/), your [music](https://sound.xyz/), your [art](https://opensea.io/), your [videos](https://d.tube/), your [followers](https://lens.xyz/), on a distributed ledger, or “on chain”. As [LBRY](https://lbry.io/) puts it: “LBRY does to publishing what Bitcoin did to money.” Just like with your currency, everyone participating in the economy agrees that “yes, [Leo](https://app.ens.domains/name/leosn.eth/details), you wrote this blog”. Sites like Spotify and Instagram don’t manage your songs and your followers because these songs and follower relationships are stored on chain, and Spotify is reduced to one of many organisations competing to merely display this content in the best way, and help you discover new content as well. Creators are not beholden to any of them – and neither are consumers[12](#footnote-12).\n\nSo now the community economy is fully on the way because finally, **dedicated participants in a niche community can meaningfully support their creators**. When people are deeply engaged in something they care about, even the original consumers become contributors, and we’ll start to see vibrant ecosystems formed around niches and creators. Greg Isenberg explores the [Loot ecosystem](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/heres-what-the-future-of-nfts-looks?s=r#:\\~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20an%20ecosystem%20not%20just%20an%20nft), an NFT project upon which creators have realised myriad different ideas; [Jenkins the Valet](https://www.jenkinsthevalet.com/how-it-works) is a great example of community-led storytelling, which will become a category-defining cultural genre in the 2020s, on par with ‘art’ and ‘literature’. [Jadyn Violet](https://twitter.com/jadynviolet), a musician, told me that “I’ve never got this much interaction on my art before.” He's been spending his time building new ideas to engage his community, spending time speaking with his fans, and making more music — this is what his fans love him for.\n\nBusiness people often talk about the Minimum Viable Product your business needs before you start selling. The MVP isn’t dead, but all businesses (not just creators) will soon require a [Minimum Viable Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uPRruLfZoU&t=2s) to make a mark in their market[13](#footnote-13).\n\nWhat will underlie all of these communities are tokens of membership, probably tiered, which tie a community together. They’ll be non-fungible, which means they’ll be unique and personalisable, thus allowing for deeper engagement. **Consumers get dedicated community and deeper value in a niche they care about; creators are finally rewarded fairly for their work.** \n\n![Tiered NFT collections can help creators build more intimate communities.

Google was only just getting started, but after aligning with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, became the favoured search engine of billions.\n\nJoe Kraus, the founder of Excite, [explains why](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=i%20went%20to%20revisit%20joe%20kraus): Excite had been a 20th century company, targeting revenue from the top ten American companies, as media businesses had been doing for decades. Meanwhile, Google focused on attracting advertisers — and millions of them. Why did this work? *“The 20th century was about dozens of markets of millions of consumers. **The 21st century is about millions of markets of dozens of consumers.**”*\n\n*Hopefully you didn’t realise you just read 3,000 words; I’d love it if you were to [subscribe](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/subscribe) or mint one of 5 editions.*\n\n[1](#footnote-anchor-1) I don’t have the percentage figures for the change in sweetshops and clothing stores, I’m sorry.\n\n[2](#footnote-anchor-2) Other blogging platforms are available, but they’re still *built* for writers: [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), whilst I’m testing the beta of [Nuance](http://nuance.xyz/).\n\n[3](#footnote-anchor-3) Stratechery anticipated this for (cable) TV in [2013](https://stratechery.com/2013/the-jobs-tv-does/#:\\~:text=the%20jobs%20tv%20has%20traditionally%20done%20include) and watched it happen in [2017](https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/#:\\~:text=tv%20is%20broken%20up%20into%20the%20different%20%E2%80%9Cjobs%E2%80%9D%20it%20has%20traditionally%20done): TV used to keep us **informed**, **educate** us, show **live events**, tell **stories**, and provide **escapism**. But now we get our information from Google; our education from YouTube, Coursera, or Masterworks; our live events from Twitch; our story-telling from Netflix; and our escapism from social media. It’s not as neat as this of course: in reality, everything just exploded into a plethora of mainly mobile options; but unbundling is happening.\n\n[4](#footnote-anchor-4) I number crunched some of the Instagram follower stats [here](https://mention.com/en/reports/instagram/followers/) and would estimate that of all the follower-followee relationships, the largest 1% of accounts receive about 50% of all following relationships.\n\n[5](#footnote-anchor-5) I’m undecided and unclear on what this means for ‘great’ or ‘classic’ cultural contributions. If a great cultural contribution captures an image of society, but also moves it on, how can it be classic, if being classic is continuing to capture that image of society: hasn’t society moved on and been influenced by your contribution? \n\n[6](#footnote-anchor-6) Woodbury is mainly making the argument that it is specifically “a 20th-century culture centered around white leading men” that is dying, but whilst it’s true that celebrities are becoming more diverse, what’s more important is that they’re becoming less relevant. The social media era is dying; the social community era is coming.\n\n[7](#footnote-anchor-7) It’s ironic that in principle ‘agency’ is the most important thing in the world, whilst ‘agencies’ that help brands and creators reach their fans are typically seen as vultures.\n\n[8](#footnote-anchor-8) I also expect niche and tailored content that is ***emphatically artificial***: a further implication of this, from the unrelated and sufficient cause of AI too, is that individuals will asymptote towards consuming cultural content that is tailored just for them: *an audience of one*. As artificial intelligence (which was also covered [last month](http://The asymptote we reach is that for most people, most of the time, their reading and viewing material is created just for them)) gets more able to accurately predict our interests and preferences at a subtle scale, we get to a world in which content is designed – no, generated – to appeal specifically to us. GPT-3 is an OpenAI algorithm that can conduct incredibly lifelike conversation (at times). [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/news/openai-punished-dev-used-gpt-3-to-resurrect-dead-ethics) covers the story of one developer who used the algorithm to sell bots that spoke with the *individual personalities* of an individual chosen by a customer, including dead relatives. As always, there are challenges that accompany change, as well as opportunities; AI will continue to develop, but the risk and threat of AI trained to stimulate and manipulate us need to be managed. *Further reading: [The Diff](https://www.thediff.co/p/what-happens-when-most-media-is-produced?s=r) explores this idea from a more financial perspective; the [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/27/1088140809/fake-linkedin-profiles) illustrates a perfect example, with fake LinkedIn profiles generated explicitly to pique your interest; [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/04/when-your-bot-is-better-than-you.html) touches on the issue from the other perspective, that of the person using the bot.*\n\n[9](#footnote-anchor-9) Sources: Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube stats [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/); in 2021 Spotify paid [$7bn](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) to [8 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) creators, which is $875 or £700 (slightly higher than the claim in the a16z source above).\n\n[10](#footnote-anchor-10) Take the price of Bitcoin as a proxy for ‘web3 in vogue’ for a moment. When a16z published the 100 True Fans articles in February 2020, Bitcoin was worth under <$10k, and wouldn’t get above that price until October. The niche market vibe shift predates the cultural significance of web3 and crypto.\n\n[11](#footnote-anchor-11) I’m simplifying a lot; this isn’t a technical introduction to web3. Most obviously, it’s not the case that each person has to manually agree everything in a distributed ledger. Rather, it’s every computer server; and it’s not every computer server, it’s those who proactively commit to contributing to manage the ledger and communicating with it.

[Bitcoin miners hit the headlines](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/01/bitcoin-miners-are-selling-off-their-btc-holdings-to-cope-with-market-headwinds/) after selling off, the [Optimism airdrop](https://thedefiant.io/op-airdrop-claim-guide/) went live, the [Terra saga ](https://thedefiant.io/luna-coin-surge-terra-roundup/)continued to make the news, and Solana NFTs sit atop the volume rankings [despite the shutdown ](https://decrypt.co/101834/bug-brings-down-solana-blockchain-for-four-hours)this week.\n\nAfter all that, it’s time to have a little fun and relax with The Friday Buzz!\n\n## [ZooDAO ($ZOO)](https://zoodao.com/) — [Pacifico](https://discoverpacifico.com/) & [Double-Strength Margarita Mix](https://cuervo.com/)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*mlKm6QPf2y6gIW4T)\n\nFeeling a little more burned-out than usual this week? This might be just the combo to loosen things up, although it may also be a little crazy.\n\nZooDAO ($ZOO) is a project I’ve been following personally for a long time now. It’s still in the early development stages, but the vision of the project is exciting and the team is well-supported. I believe it COULD be one of the NFT projects ready to take-off when the bull market returns, but don’t get me wrong here, this is a high-risk, long-term hold with no guarantees.\n\nSome may say that my love of a Pacifico mixed with double-strength margarita mix is just another sign I drink too much, but hell, it hits the spot during the summer down here in Texas. It’s even better for putting the week of work behind me because it doesn’t take much before I’m feeling the Friday buzz… and only a couple more before I’m plain drunk… and only a couple more before I wake up thinking “What the hell happened? I gotta stop drinking that sh\\*t.”\n\n## [Propy ($PRO)](https://propy.com/browse/) — [Slow & Low Rock & Rye](https://www.drinkslowandlow.com/products/rock-and-rye)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*rRsCgFKl4iRgv8dC)\n\nA good friend of mine introduced me to “Slow & Low” many years ago, and I’ve kept some around ever since. When I go to a bar that serves a great Old Fashioned, I always go back. However, it’s so tough to make a good one from home that, before I knew about this stuff, I rarely got the chance to enjoy this DELICIOUS drink. Now, it’s one of my go-to favorites, especially on a Friday.\n\nI think Propy is the perfect token to go along with Hochstadter’s Rock & Rye this week. I started following the project a few weeks ago as I continue to dive deep into the intersection of crypto and real estate. It’s been around for a while and already boasts some pretty amazing accomplishments. When we look back ten years from now, my bet is that Propy will be one of the major contributors connecting the “old fashioned” real estate market to the decentralized world of blockchain.\n\n## [THORWallet ($TGT)](https://www.thorwallet.org/) — [Carlsberg Elephant](https://www.carlsberg.com/en/our-beer/elephant-strong/)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*vimFK80\\_ofXV5k4g)\n\nIf you’re looking for something with a strong kick, a little $TGT and Carlsberg Elephant is the way to go.

The THORWallet DEX is a promising project within the THORChain ecosystem, and I think it gives you the opportunity for some stronger exposure/higher potential gains due to the token’s low market cap at just $2.3M according to CoinGecko.\n\nAs always, higher upside potential comes with higher risk, and we’re going pretty hard on the gambling this week. Then again, this is crypto, and we’ve gotta have some fun every once in a while right?\n\nJust pay attention to risks, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and try to learn something along the way.\n\nHave a great weekend and… Always Drink (and Trade) Responsibly!\n", "timestamp": 1654284716, "digest": "QtMw0VMv71HvExGvpa2zhKPghJ5ICh58T--9b36fxYg", "contributor": "0x488CB7D6F7596ACcf0544913Aa9e0d0f38F315F4"}

This process operates at every level of life — the goals just shift based on local context and conditions.\n\nAt the human level, each of us pursue our own goals and sense-make for ourselves. We individually construct an interpretation of our experience according to our own central nervous system and consciousness.\n\nIt’s only in relation to other human beings that we have to contend with the goals of other individuals. And it’s there where shared or competing goals are determined.\n\nSocially, we’re aided by shared languaging (the totality of our intercommunications) and the emergent culture surrounding us, which further scaffolds, frames, and constrains our individual experience of sense-making.\n\nOur personal realities are relative, subject to the localized information available to one’s consciousness in each moment.

{"id": "6B5yrikm6A3OzDu0_ehcjQNAmqfEXVD27imnzBCZL2c", "title": "How does Frax Finance Works?", "body": "## What is FRAX?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gzsf4rZ9_j_qzQ7WhRiAw.jpeg?height=721&width=1281)\n\nFrax is a decentralized fractional stablecoin. This means, it’s partially collateralized with on-chain crypto (USDC) and the other bit is backed by an algorithm.\n\nThe stablecoins market is very well established. How does Frax add a flavor to it? Let’s understand stablecoins first.\n\nThe goal of any stablecoin is simple— maintain its peg to 1 USD. However, things get fiercely complex to achieve this simple goal.\n\nNumerous methods like fiat collateralization, commodity backing, crypto collateralization, and complex computer algorithms have been used in the past. Here are some live results:\n\nDAI is over collateralized.\n\nUSDT is fiat-backed but centralized. *[USDT has been frozen](https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-blacklists-39-ethereum-addresses-worth-over-46-million)* in the past.\n\nUST was completely algorithm-backed. However, the faith has been lost in stablecoins with its *[recent spiral death](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahulrai/2022/05/17/the-death-spiral-how-terras-algorithmic-stablecoin-came-crashing-down/#:\\~:text=This%20selling%20pressure%20on%20UST,inflationary%20loop%20in%20LUNA's%20supply)*.\n\nOn the contrary, FRAX is neither a hundred percent Fiat nor algorithm backed, only collateralized by the given fraction called collateralization ratio.\n\nThis collateralization ratio is however not decided by the Frax protocol. The collateral can go in any direction in long run. It only adjusts to keep the peg of FRAX to $1.\n\n## Minting & Stability of FRAX\n\n### Minting\n\nThe *[FRAX minting process](https://docs.frax.finance/minting-and-redeeming)* is kept simple. To mint one FRAX (worth $1) a collateral amount (only USDC) along with Frax governance token (FXS) within the parameters of the pre-determined collateral ratio is locked in Frax Finance treasury.\n\nFor instance, if the collateral ratio is 85 percent, 0.85 percent of USDC with 0.15 percent of FXS can be locked in Frax Protocol to mint one FRAX. The same can be redeemed, if the FRAX is returned to its protocol, the user is given back the locked assets (USDC and FXS).\n\n### Stability\n\nSay the price of Frax breaks its peg either way up or down. The stability can be restored. The process is fairly incentivized for users to even care about it\n\nFor instance, if the Frax trades above a dollar, Arbitrageurs can deposit USDC and FXS only worth a dollar in the required collateral ratio, to mint one FRAX token. This token then can be traded in the open market and the user can bag the difference.\n\nFor the other way around, if Frax trades below a dollar, arbitrageurs can buy from the open market at less than a dollar, and then redeem it to bag the USDC & FXS in a collateralized ratio worth one dollar.\n\nHowever, the collateral ratio is entitled to change according to market demands. Say, you deposited 80 USDC and 20 dollars’ worth of FXS to mint 100 FRAX. Upon redemption, you may receive deposited assets in different ratio as it is subject to change.\n\n## FXS– The Governance Token & Value accrual\n\nAt the genesis of FXS tokenomics, the supply was capped at a total of 100 million.\n\nWith every FRAX mint, the collateralized FXS is burnt. This creates a limited supply of its governance token. As the usage of Frax ups, the supply of FXS is reduced, creating more value for its governance token and to its holders.\n\nHey, the holders can pool FXS in liquidity pairs like FXS/FRAX, and FXS/ETH on Uniswap to earn a small cut for gas collected on every swap.\n\nWith more veFXS comes more Voting powers. It follows a similar voting escrow model that is popular amongst other DeFi protocols.\n\nUsers can lock up their FXS in return for veFXS for up to 4 years, the higher the locking period the maximum rewards, yeah, yeah, you get it. The reward for veFXS seems promising:\n\n* Governance rights\n* Special boost rewards\n* AMOs profits\n\n*[Frax AMOs](https://app.frax.finance/amos)* are programmatically designed to move the collateral USDC to other DeFi ecosystems to efficiently enhance the profits without actually breaking the FRAX peg to $1. The profits are then used to rebuy Frax and burn it, or directly lend profits to veFXS holders.\n\nIn any other case if the collateralization ratio is increased, requiring more USDC collateral. The AMO reverses and deposits the USDC back until FRAX restores confidence.\n\nFrax has implemented several important AMOs, each AMO works hard (lol, computer programs) to bring maximum profits to the Frax treasury.\n\n* FRAX 1559\n* Collateral investor\n* Curve AMO\n* Uniswap V3\n* Frax lending\n\nThe majority of profits are brought in by the collateral investor AMO which is about $70 million, while other AMOs also have a fair share in accruing the profits.\n\n## veFXS Upgrade: Frax, Convex, and Curve wars\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe story of reaps & rewards goes further with their *[partnership with Convex](https://convexfinance.medium.com/december-update-protocol-expansion-cvx-eth-incentive-migration-2c9327b48259#0a3b)*. From here on things are a bit complex, if, in simpler terms, it’s more money for veFXS holders. Before we head on to how this partnership benefits FRAX and its holders, let’s understand Convex Protocol first.\n\nDecrypting in 3… 2… 1… Go!\n\nSoon after its launch,\\* \\*Convex Protocol gained traction in the DeFi space. Here’s why— Simplicity and more rewards. The user couldn’t ask for more— unless it’s even more money.\n\nConvex simplifies now what is known as the Curve wars on its user's behalf.\n\nIt soon began accruing CRV and veCRV, and by the first half of 2021, it became the largest holder of veCRV.\n\nThis is where Curve Wars gets intéressant. With more veCRV comes more Voting powers. Wait, but how’s voting power gonna help— unless it’s about money.\n\nEvery 10 days, the curve emissions are decided by the veCRV holders— the voters.

Specifically, these Victorian-themed tuckshops and sweet connoisseurs, plucked from two hundred years prior and plopped in the middle of a high street that doesn’t quite know how to welcome its new tenant. One of the sweet shops near me plasters ‘Toys, Trains, Treats” on dated storefront panelling; it’s the shop you thought your grandparents went to when they were young, except the steam trains on sale are battery powered.\n\nThis wasn’t just a Baader–Meinhof [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion), where upon seeing something once you perceive it everywhere. During the first year of the pandemic, an extra [73](https://www.mylondon.news/news/uk-world-news/i-visited-londons-new-dangerous-22961908#:\\~:text=73%20more%20sweet%20shops%20in%20the%20uk%20compared%20with%202020) sweetshops popped up in the UK, net, according to the Local Data Company. That’s not a huge number, but it’s pretty significant given the broader lockdown context; the total number of clothing shops fell by 1,236 in the same period[1](#footnote-1). The shop near me was set up in September ‘21. It begs the question: what’s so special about sweet shops?\n\nI had spent my Saturday morning at Waterstones buying some books, at the sweet shop questioning the shop assistant, and now I’m writing about it on Substack. In days gone by, I would have bought my physical items at Sainsbury’s and, in comparison to today, where I have my Substack and my main [website](https://www.leonasskau.co.uk/), all my digital publishing would be through the same technology stack, probably Wordpress.\n\nSweets are nice, but the real difference is the existence of a shop that will focus all of its resources on their specific niche product. I bought some weird caramel chocolate flakes that defy description, but they were excellent. I certainly paid a premium, but next time I want sweets, I’ll go there again, because *they know their product*; I just bought what the shop assistant recommended. At Waterstone’s, I picked up [Train Dreams](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/13/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review) because I told the manager I was after contemporary fiction; I use Substack because it’s built for writers[2](#footnote-2). **What makes these businesses special is that they serve *niche markets in which they can give people much deeper value.***\n\n![I mean, you get what I’m saying, despite the weird animojis, right? (HelloDorking)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xRINH9-26W7ZvCggFpXtm.jpeg?height=2438&width=3024)\n\n## Unbundling into niches\n\nBundling and unbundling are [not new concepts](https://hbr.org/1999/03/unbundling-the-corporation). It’s a pretty simple convection model: you start with a business, over time you add more products, services, and features, and then you get bloated, do everything ‘kinda well’, until a niche competitor comes along and does *one* of your services *really really well*, and bit by bit you get pieced apart. The [complexity convection](https://every.to/divinations/complexity-convection-765851) is a pattern that cannot be unseen. \n\nPeople have observed this happening to our contemporary digital landscape for about a decade, beginning in practice much earlier. Craigslist was [unbundled](https://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/345941486/the-spawn-of-craigslist-like-most-vcs-that-focus) into many things, including Reddit, which is now being [unbundled](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit?s=r) into many more things, like Nextdoor. In the language of [a16z](https://a16z.com/2019/09/11/platforms-verticals-unbundling/), the famed tech investors: platforms get unbundled into verticals, which turn into platforms, at which point the cycle resumes, and all of a sudden I’ve turned into a strategy writer[3](#footnote-3). \n\nI’m not the first to herald this unbundling in the physical world either. Peter Day [wrote](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=Economy%2C%20%20almost%20a,speed%20and%20efficiency.) an excellent essay predicting “the heartbeat economy, almost a concierge approach to customers,” in 2013:\n\n> `“This would be a worryingly intimate relationship for many businesses, but one which might provide a new kind of rewarding marketplace if they dared to be far closer to their customers' individuality.”`\n\nHe wrote about it in the BBC, but today he would write on his own blog.\n\nMy real contribution is to note that this challenges why unbundling and bundling happens at all. The main idea behind why we sway between bundled and unbundled products is the [underlying technology](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling#:\\~:text=a%20lot%20of%20it%20is%20based%20on%20the%20underlying%20technology%20change). Marc Andreesen, co-founder of a16z and of [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)), the first web browser, talks through the concept of the newspaper:\n\n> `“The newspaper bundle, the idea of this slug of news and sports scores and classifieds and stock quotes that arrives once a day was a consequence of the printing plant, of the distribution network for newspapers using trucks and newsstands, and the famous newspaper delivery boy. That newspaper bundle was based on the distribution technology of a time and place.`\n>\n> `When the distribution technology changed with the internet, there was going to be the great unwind, and then the great rebundle, in the form of Google and Facebook and Twitter.”`\n\nThis is certainly true: we could only put [live events on Twitch](https://youtu.be/TCPjk8Tpb5c?t=1025) after network infrastructure made it cheap enough to broadcast live video around the world.\n\nBut it’s no coincidence that physical businesses are unbundling at the same time as digital ones, despite relying on different technologies, and often very little tech at all. Neither technology nor innovations built upon it come from magic: what consumers *actually want* plays a key role; today it’s driven by the niche market vibe shift.\n\nWhy? Well first, consumer demand fosters technological innovation. I took a cursory glance at solar panels [last month](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/podcast-discussion-negotiating-our?s=w#:\\~:text=we%E2%80%99re%20already%20on%20the%20way.%20solar%2C%20wind%2C%20fusion%2C%20geothermal%2C%20and%20hydrogen%20energy%20technologies%20have%20all%20advanced%20significantly%20even%20in%20the%20past%20decade.), where growing consumer demand and growing production have *induced* new technologies; if people hadn’t bothered to use streaming services in the early days, there wouldn’t have been the investment that made them possible at scale. Substack was built because its founders [believed](https://every.to/divinations/substack-s-ideology) writers wanted to offer readers deeper value in a specific niche - and that [readers would pay for it](https://twitter.com/hamishmckenzie/status/1532432557513404416) – not due to any new technologies, just due to the niche market vibe shift.\n\nSecond, even when this technological innovation happens, there is no rule commanding consumers to use every new use case that’s suddenly made possible. Google, Facebook, and Twitter all had to create new bundles that people actually wanted to use: do [Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B), [Google Answers](http://answers.google.com/answers/faq.html#:\\~:text=google%20answers%20was%20an%20experimental%20product%20for%20users%20to%20get%20help%20from%20researchers%20with%20expertise%20in%20online%20searching.), or [Google Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Notebook#:\\~:text=allowed%20users%20to%20save%20and%20organize%20clips%20of%20information%20while%20conducting%20research%20online) ring a bell?\n\n**I think the reason I’m seeing more sweetshops around is because of a niche market vibe shift. The technology for serving more niche communities has always existed, but now consumers actually want it. *But what does this mean?***\n\n\n---\n\nI have two quick points before we move on: why this insight is important and why this shift is happening.\n\nFirst, understanding that bundling and unbundling cycles sway partly due to social preferences, as well as technology, is important to understanding where these sways stop and start, and how to take advantage of them. If it’s true that people want more meaningful, participatory communities, that tells us a lot more about where the future is going than simply observing the entire possibility space opened up by new technologies. When I looked at those failed Google products, I got the impression that Google - founded by Stanford grads - originally sought to be a lot more academic than it is today, with tools for professional research and note-taking. We can understand that these products failed because they weren’t aligned with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, even though they were technically feasible.\n\nSecond, my quick take is that this shift has its roots in society’s search for reciprocal connection. The 21st century is probably the only century that will ever be worth calling ‘the internet century’ (by the 22nd the internet won’t be exciting anymore). Today’s internet is very uni-directional, with big influencers megaphoning to their followers[4](#footnote-4). But people also want to [belong ](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/about#:\\~:text=the%20sense%20of%20belonging%20that%20humans%20inherently%20desire)to something, and as I wrote a few months ago, building connections *[within](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/leading-movements-communicating-change?s=w#:\\~:text=so%20build%20connections-,within,-your%20movement)* your community makes it so much more fulfilling. You feel you’re really participating, and this is really why I go to the sweet shop. Society just invented the internet, and is searching for meaning. Also [G](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/great-recession-still-with-us/547268/).[F](https://www.bruegel.org/2018/10/ten-years-after-the-crisis-the-wests-failure-pushing-china-towards-state-capitalism/).[C](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227439075_THE_IMPACT_OF_THE_ECONOMIC_CRISIS_ON_CULTURE).\n\n![This is a great time to take a break, maybe stretch your legs, and share with a friend! (Kevin Huynh)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7pYdkgZ_QQytonD6G7z0-.webp?height=796&width=1456)\n\n\n---\n\nThe rest of this essay is to explore how this shift is influencing culture. We can think pretty big about *all* the unbundling opportunities new technologies bring: in *[Life After Google](https://www.waterstones.com/book/life-after-google/george-gilder/9781621575764)*, Gilder points out that even money *could* be unbundled, though I don’t think this is on the cards. It’s possible, but consumers don’t actually want to unbundle money into a store of value, unit of account, and so forth. Very few communities are built simply around money as a tool; everyone will *not* become [currency traders](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/12/11/bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-web3-great-protocol-politics/#:\\~:text=everyone%20becomes%20a%20foreign-exchange%20trader); a niche can’t be built around something that everyone uses, and most people don’t care.\n\nI want to instead focus on culture, which people care a lot about, and is interesting for many further reasons. It interests me how great cultural contributions both capture some image of society whilst also moving it forward[5](#footnote-5). Culture is also beautifully adaptable and flexible and fluid, changing rapidly and exhibiting immense diversity of contribution and consumption: it’s a *collection of niches*. I expect this vibe shift to play out in culture very soon. (It goes without saying that this will occur on the internet.)\n\nThat idea of culture as a collection of niches deserves interrogating: culture is also something that we all share. And sure, there will continue to be big Instagram accounts and large supermarkets; shows and books that everyone talks about and events that unite the masses. But as Rex Woodbury notes: “[Celebrities like (Tom) Cruise are a dying breed](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/cultural-transmission-in-the-internet?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NTcwOTkyMTIsIl8iOiJlcTFDOSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDE2NzYxMywiZXhwIjoxNjU0MTcxMjEzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzg1MDAiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.pfK8o_nxyz7FIehX7-CkXaRKa-d0-3YhcJ1I1r_YRkg&s=r#:\\~:text=celebrities%20like%20cruise%20are%20a%20dying%20breed)”[6](#footnote-6). The 2020s will be defined by the “[long tail of creators](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/the-two-way-mirror-of-art-and-technology?s=w#:\\~:text=embolden%20the%20long%20tail%20of%20creators)”, each creating en mass for far smaller communities with much deeper engagement. In the 21st century, we will seek experiences that feel, in some important ways (and not all), totally and emphatically human — that’s why people love [eSports](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-watch-other-people-play-video?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDUxMzUyMzksIl8iOiJrK0hyQSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDIwNjQ5OSwiZXhwIjoxNjU0MjEwMDk5LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzMyOTk2Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.T5f6CkyK7SFpzLO3nZZ6U2Zudqkkf4npc9ZsqDnSqFg&s=r#:\\~:text=as%20totally%20and%20unabashedly%20human); we’re in the moment *with* the players. **For the hobbies and niches that we love, for which we’re far more than mere followers, we’ll find people serving that niche with dedicated communities built around them.**\n\n[Late Checkout](https://latecheckout.studio/about) is an agency that doesn’t deserve the negative tag associated with such companies[7](#footnote-7); they capture the situation perfectly:\n\n> `“The old way of building products was to try and be everything to everyone. Products were chunky, bloated, and didn’t serve the individual or communities.”`\n>\n> `“People want to feel a connection to the products they use. They want the internet to feel human and alive again.”`\n\nIt’s exciting to see people building the future, and culturally we’re going to see exactly this: **content will be built around niche and dedicated communities with genuine human connection**[8](#footnote-8).\n\n\n---\n\n## And thus the 1,000 True Fans thesis eventually manifests.\n\nIn 2008, Kevin Kelly wrote one of the most seminal contributions in culture tech. The founding editor-in-chief of Wired wrote that, in the internet age:\n\n> `“To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans.”`\n\nA thousand dedicated fans who love your niche. Sound familiar? \n\nSo what took so long?\n\nIt’s certainly the case that the technology of the era made this difficult. Kelly hoped that the internet would be the ultimate matchmaker. Bring the creators and the consumers online, and they will find each other. To an extent, they did, especially in the early days of the internet: in 2008, writing about 1000 True Fans looked sensible. But it was still pretty hard: you could publish your own content, but without mass-market services like Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube, that helped you discover, it was tough to find or be found.\n\nThe introduction of these services, monoliths to be, helped in one sense: it was a lot easier for people to find you on the internet. But the price for this matchmaking was almost everything: Facebook and Instagram take almost 100% of all the revenue creators see on their platforms; YouTube takes 45%; Spotify paid an average of merely £700 to each artist last year[9](#footnote-9). These monoliths do the matching, but make it virtually unaffordable to create in the first place.\n\nIt was a vibe shift, not a technological one, that struck the first blow to this impoverished paradigm. Twitch, Kickstarter, Patreon, Substack, amongst many others, are all services built for creators to cater for the dedicated fans of their niche; all built amidst the community-centric vibe shift born in the 2010s. Well before the 2020 crypto bull run, a16z heralded a [100 True Fans model](https://future.a16z.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/) in 2020[10](#footnote-10), arguing that this was made possible with even more niche services from Podia, Teachable, and Kajabi. (These companies *all* help people sell educational courses, which undermines the argument to an extent, but you only need 250 fans paying £20/$25 per month to earn \\~3x the average UK salary or [$75,000](https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html#:\\~:text=no%20matter%20how%20much%20more), so you get the picture.) **With the alignment of technology and the vibe, the impoverished paradigm of community-stricken creatorship is collapsing.**\n\n\n---\n\n### Blockchain is a game-changer for this dynamic\n\n*You’re reading on Mirror, so you probably know all this; you could easily skip to the next phrase in bold.*\n\nIn the early 2020s, new technologies like blockchain, distributed ledgers, and cryptocurrencies really came in vogue. A distributed ledger is triple-entry bookkeeping. [Double-entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping) bookkeeping was invented in medieval Italy: two parties to a transaction would both record it, giving you more data about your business and more verifiable figures, making it easier to trade and pursue enterprise.\n\nEight centuries later, distributed ledgers are triple-entry bookkeeping: as well as the seller and buyer, *every participant in the economy* makes a record of the transaction, and every participant is using the same, enormous, book. Blockchain is the technology of how you add to this book and run software with it, and cryptocurrency is one use case: the ledger essentially records how much currency you own, which everyone verifies. Obviously I’m simplifying, but I’ll refer to these technologies as ‘web3 techs’[11](#footnote-11).\n\nThe significance of blockchain becomes clear upon interrogating why Facebook, YouTube, *et al.* can take such high take rates on creators. One side is [discovery](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does#:\\~:text=no%20one%20finds%20a%20person%20on%20patreon%3B%20you%20go%20there%20after%20you%E2%80%99ve%20found%20them): you rarely *find* creators on Patreon. This happens, still, on big social networks. Everyone is on these platforms (well, not Facebook) and when you consume on these platforms frequently, they’re experts in figuring out what content you’ll click on next; big data, [Markov chains](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-markov-chains-50da3645a50d#:\\~:text=predict%20weather%20for%20days%20to%20come%2C%20based%20on%20what%20the%20current%20weather%20state%20is%20at%20the%20time), etc. There are some problems with this, mainly that you get served addictive content rather than niches that you want to engage deeply in, but generally they do this job pretty well, and web3 techs don’t hugely change this.\n\nBut there are a lot of platforms for discovery — this isn’t the competitive moat it once was. People use Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Pinterest, and much more, in addition to the discovery platforms we’ve called out above; as mentioned, most people have moved beyond Facebook. Creators could just move to whichever discovery network takes the smallest cut of their revenue. Apart from one thing: they can’t. Everything you’ve ever uploaded to Spotify and all the followers you’ve earnt on Insta: the discovery platform manages this, and you can’t take your community with you. So it’s impossible to leave without starting all over again. And hence discovery networks [squeeze](https://stratechery.com/2015/niches-problem-subscription-services/) creators for revenue.\n\nAnd hence, the game-changer. Because just like with your cryptocurrency, you can store your [writing](https://mirror.xyz/), your [music](https://sound.xyz/), your [art](https://opensea.io/), your [videos](https://d.tube/), your [followers](https://lens.xyz/), on a distributed ledger, or “on chain”. As [LBRY](https://lbry.io/) puts it: “LBRY does to publishing what Bitcoin did to money.” Just like with your currency, everyone participating in the economy agrees that “yes, [Leo](https://app.ens.domains/name/leosn.eth/details), you wrote this blog”. Sites like Spotify and Instagram don’t manage your songs and your followers because these songs and follower relationships are stored on chain, and Spotify is reduced to one of many organisations competing to merely display this content in the best way, and help you discover new content as well. Creators are not beholden to any of them – and neither are consumers[12](#footnote-12).\n\nSo now the community economy is fully on the way because finally, **dedicated participants in a niche community can meaningfully support their creators**. When people are deeply engaged in something they care about, even the original consumers become contributors, and we’ll start to see vibrant ecosystems formed around niches and creators. Greg Isenberg explores the [Loot ecosystem](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/heres-what-the-future-of-nfts-looks?s=r#:\\~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20an%20ecosystem%20not%20just%20an%20nft), an NFT project upon which creators have realised myriad different ideas; [Jenkins the Valet](https://www.jenkinsthevalet.com/how-it-works) is a great example of community-led storytelling, which will become a category-defining cultural genre in the 2020s, on par with ‘art’ and ‘literature’. [Jadyn Violet](https://twitter.com/jadynviolet), a musician, told me that “I’ve never got this much interaction on my art before.” He's been spending his time building new ideas to engage his community, spending time speaking with his fans, and making more music — this is what his fans love him for.\n\nBusiness people often talk about the Minimum Viable Product your business needs before you start selling. The MVP isn’t dead, but all businesses (not just creators) will soon require a [Minimum Viable Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uPRruLfZoU&t=2s) to make a mark in their market[13](#footnote-13).\n\nWhat will underlie all of these communities are tokens of membership, probably tiered, which tie a community together. They’ll be non-fungible, which means they’ll be unique and personalisable, thus allowing for deeper engagement. **Consumers get dedicated community and deeper value in a niche they care about; creators are finally rewarded fairly for their work.** \n\n![Tiered NFT collections can help creators build more intimate communities. Everyone wants this; web3 makes it possible.

Google was only just getting started, but after aligning with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, became the favoured search engine of billions.\n\nJoe Kraus, the founder of Excite, [explains why](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=i%20went%20to%20revisit%20joe%20kraus): Excite had been a 20th century company, targeting revenue from the top ten American companies, as media businesses had been doing for decades. Meanwhile, Google focused on attracting advertisers — and millions of them. Why did this work? *“The 20th century was about dozens of markets of millions of consumers. **The 21st century is about millions of markets of dozens of consumers.**”*\n\n\n---\n\n*Hopefully that didn’t actually feel like 3,000 words; I’d love it if you were to [subscribe](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/subscribe) or mint one of 5 editions.*\n\n\n---\n\n`Image credits: HelloDorking; Kevin Huynh; Peter Yang`\n\n***Footnotes:***\n\n[1](#footnote-anchor-1) I don’t have the percentage figures for the change in sweetshops and clothing stores, I’m sorry.\n\n[2](#footnote-anchor-2) Other blogging platforms are available, including this one, but they’re still *built* for writers; I’m testing the beta of [Nuance](http://nuance.xyz/).\n\n[3](#footnote-anchor-3) Stratechery anticipated this for (cable) TV in [2013](https://stratechery.com/2013/the-jobs-tv-does/#:\\~:text=the%20jobs%20tv%20has%20traditionally%20done%20include) and watched it happen in [2017](https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/#:\\~:text=tv%20is%20broken%20up%20into%20the%20different%20%E2%80%9Cjobs%E2%80%9D%20it%20has%20traditionally%20done): TV used to keep us **informed**, **educate** us, show **live events**, tell **stories**, and provide **escapism**. But now we get our information from Google; our education from YouTube, Coursera, or Masterworks; our live events from Twitch; our story-telling from Netflix; and our escapism from social media. It’s not as neat as this of course: in reality, everything just exploded into a plethora of mainly mobile options; but unbundling is happening.\n\n[4](#footnote-anchor-4) I number crunched some of the Instagram follower stats [here](https://mention.com/en/reports/instagram/followers/) and would estimate that of all the follower-followee relationships, the largest 1% of accounts receive about 50% of all following relationships.\n\n[5](#footnote-anchor-5) I’m undecided and unclear on what this means for ‘great’ or ‘classic’ cultural contributions. If a great cultural contribution captures an image of society, but also moves it on, how can it be classic, if being classic is continuing to capture that image of society: hasn’t society moved on and been influenced by your contribution? \n\n[6](#footnote-anchor-6) Woodbury is mainly making the argument that it is specifically “a 20th-century culture centered around white leading men” that is dying, but whilst it’s true that celebrities are becoming more diverse, what’s more important is that they’re becoming less relevant. The social media era is dying; the social community era is coming.\n\n[7](#footnote-anchor-7) It’s ironic that in principle ‘agency’ is the most important thing in the world, whilst ‘agencies’ that help brands and creators reach their fans are typically seen as vultures.\n\n[8](#footnote-anchor-8) I also expect niche and tailored content that is ***emphatically artificial***: a further implication of this, from the unrelated and sufficient cause of AI too, is that individuals will asymptote towards consuming cultural content that is tailored just for them: *an audience of one*. As artificial intelligence (which was also covered [last month](http://The asymptote we reach is that for most people, most of the time, their reading and viewing material is created just for them)) gets more able to accurately predict our interests and preferences at a subtle scale, we get to a world in which content is designed – no, generated – to appeal specifically to us. GPT-3 is an OpenAI algorithm that can conduct incredibly lifelike conversation (at times). [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/news/openai-punished-dev-used-gpt-3-to-resurrect-dead-ethics) covers the story of one developer who used the algorithm to sell bots that spoke with the *individual personalities* of an individual chosen by a customer, including dead relatives. As always, there are challenges that accompany change, as well as opportunities; AI will continue to develop, but the risk and threat of AI trained to stimulate and manipulate us need to be managed. *Further reading: [The Diff](https://www.thediff.co/p/what-happens-when-most-media-is-produced?s=r) explores this idea from a more financial perspective; the [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/27/1088140809/fake-linkedin-profiles) illustrates a perfect example, with fake LinkedIn profiles generated explicitly to pique your interest; [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/04/when-your-bot-is-better-than-you.html) touches on the issue from the other perspective, that of the person using the bot.*\n\n[9](#footnote-anchor-9) Sources: Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube stats [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/); in 2021 Spotify paid [$7bn](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) to [8 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) creators, which is $875 or £700 (slightly higher than the claim in the a16z source above).\n\n[10](#footnote-anchor-10) Take the price of Bitcoin as a proxy for ‘web3 in vogue’ for a moment. When a16z published the 100 True Fans articles in February 2020, Bitcoin was worth under <$10k, and wouldn’t get above that price until October. The niche market vibe shift predates the cultural significance of web3 and crypto.\n\n[11](#footnote-anchor-11) I’m simplifying a lot; this isn’t a technical introduction to web3. Most obviously, it’s not the case that each person has to manually agree everything in a distributed ledger. Rather, it’s every computer server; and it’s not every computer server, it’s those who proactively commit to contributing to manage the ledger and communicating with it.

Specifically, these Victorian-themed tuckshops and sweet connoisseurs, plucked from two hundred years prior and plopped in the middle of a high street that doesn’t quite know how to welcome its new tenant. One of the sweet shops near me plasters ‘Toys, Trains, Treats” on dated storefront panelling; it’s the shop you thought your grandparents went to when they were young, except the steam trains on sale are battery powered.\n\nThis wasn’t just a Baader–Meinhof [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion), where upon seeing something once you perceive it everywhere. During the first year of the pandemic, an extra [73](https://www.mylondon.news/news/uk-world-news/i-visited-londons-new-dangerous-22961908#:\\~:text=73%20more%20sweet%20shops%20in%20the%20uk%20compared%20with%202020) sweetshops popped up in the UK, net, according to the Local Data Company. That’s not a huge number, but it’s pretty significant given the broader lockdown context; the total number of clothing shops fell by 1,236 in the same period[1](#footnote-1). The shop near me was set up in September ‘21. It begs the question: what’s so special about sweet shops?\n\nI had spent my Saturday morning at Waterstones buying some books, at the sweet shop questioning the shop assistant, and now I’m writing about it on Substack. In days gone by, I would have bought my physical items at Sainsbury’s and, in comparison to today, where I have my Substack and my main [website](https://www.leonasskau.co.uk/), all my digital publishing would be through the same technology stack, probably Wordpress.\n\nSweets are nice, but the real difference is the existence of a shop that will focus all of its resources on their specific niche product. I bought some weird caramel chocolate flakes that defy description, but they were excellent. I certainly paid a premium, but next time I want sweets, I’ll go there again, because *they know their product*; I just bought what the shop assistant recommended. At Waterstone’s, I picked up [Train Dreams](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/13/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review) because I told the manager I was after contemporary fiction; I use Substack because it’s built for writers[2](#footnote-2). **What makes these businesses special is that they serve *niche markets in which they can give people much deeper value.***\n\n![I mean, you get what I’m saying, despite the weird animojis, right? (HelloDorking)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xRINH9-26W7ZvCggFpXtm.jpeg?height=2438&width=3024)\n\n## Unbundling into niches\n\nBundling and unbundling are [not new concepts](https://hbr.org/1999/03/unbundling-the-corporation). It’s a pretty simple convection model: you start with a business, over time you add more products, services, and features, and then you get bloated, do everything ‘kinda well’, until a niche competitor comes along and does *one* of your services *really really well*, and bit by bit you get pieced apart. The [complexity convection](https://every.to/divinations/complexity-convection-765851) is a pattern that cannot be unseen. \n\nPeople have observed this happening to our contemporary digital landscape for about a decade, beginning in practice much earlier. Craigslist was [unbundled](https://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/345941486/the-spawn-of-craigslist-like-most-vcs-that-focus) into many things, including Reddit, which is now being [unbundled](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit?s=r) into many more things, like Nextdoor. In the language of [a16z](https://a16z.com/2019/09/11/platforms-verticals-unbundling/), the famed tech investors: platforms get unbundled into verticals, which turn into platforms, at which point the cycle resumes, and all of a sudden I’ve turned into a strategy writer[3](#footnote-3). \n\nI’m not the first to herald this unbundling in the physical world either. Peter Day [wrote](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=Economy%2C%20%20almost%20a,speed%20and%20efficiency.) an excellent essay predicting “the heartbeat economy, almost a concierge approach to customers,” in 2013:\n\n> `“This would be a worryingly intimate relationship for many businesses, but one which might provide a new kind of rewarding marketplace if they dared to be far closer to their customers' individuality.”`\n\nHe wrote about it in the BBC, but today he would write on his own blog.\n\nMy real contribution is to note that this challenges why unbundling and bundling happens at all. The main idea behind why we sway between bundled and unbundled products is the [underlying technology](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling#:\\~:text=a%20lot%20of%20it%20is%20based%20on%20the%20underlying%20technology%20change). Marc Andreesen, co-founder of a16z and of [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)), the first web browser, talks through the concept of the newspaper:\n\n> `“The newspaper bundle, the idea of this slug of news and sports scores and classifieds and stock quotes that arrives once a day was a consequence of the printing plant, of the distribution network for newspapers using trucks and newsstands, and the famous newspaper delivery boy. That newspaper bundle was based on the distribution technology of a time and place.`\n>\n> `When the distribution technology changed with the internet, there was going to be the great unwind, and then the great rebundle, in the form of Google and Facebook and Twitter.”`\n\nThis is certainly true: we could only put [live events on Twitch](https://youtu.be/TCPjk8Tpb5c?t=1025) after network infrastructure made it cheap enough to broadcast live video around the world.\n\nBut it’s no coincidence that physical businesses are unbundling at the same time as digital ones, despite relying on different technologies, and often very little tech at all. Neither technology nor innovations built upon it come from magic: what consumers *actually want* plays a key role; today it’s driven by the niche market vibe shift.\n\nWhy? Well first, consumer demand fosters technological innovation. I took a cursory glance at solar panels [last month](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/podcast-discussion-negotiating-our?s=w#:\\~:text=we%E2%80%99re%20already%20on%20the%20way.%20solar%2C%20wind%2C%20fusion%2C%20geothermal%2C%20and%20hydrogen%20energy%20technologies%20have%20all%20advanced%20significantly%20even%20in%20the%20past%20decade.), where growing consumer demand and growing production have *induced* new technologies; if people hadn’t bothered to use streaming services in the early days, there wouldn’t have been the investment that made them possible at scale. Substack was built because its founders [believed](https://every.to/divinations/substack-s-ideology) writers wanted to offer readers deeper value in a specific niche - and that [readers would pay for it](https://twitter.com/hamishmckenzie/status/1532432557513404416) – not due to any new technologies, just due to the niche market vibe shift.\n\nSecond, even when this technological innovation happens, there is no rule commanding consumers to use every new use case that’s suddenly made possible. Google, Facebook, and Twitter all had to create new bundles that people actually wanted to use: do [Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B), [Google Answers](http://answers.google.com/answers/faq.html#:\\~:text=google%20answers%20was%20an%20experimental%20product%20for%20users%20to%20get%20help%20from%20researchers%20with%20expertise%20in%20online%20searching.), or [Google Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Notebook#:\\~:text=allowed%20users%20to%20save%20and%20organize%20clips%20of%20information%20while%20conducting%20research%20online) ring a bell?\n\n**I think the reason I’m seeing more sweetshops around is because of a niche market vibe shift. The technology for serving more niche communities has always existed, but now consumers actually want it. *But what does this mean?***\n\n\n---\n\nI have two quick points before we move on: why this insight is important and why this shift is happening.\n\nFirst, understanding that bundling and unbundling cycles sway partly due to social preferences, as well as technology, is important to understanding where these sways stop and start, and how to take advantage of them. If it’s true that people want more meaningful, participatory communities, that tells us a lot more about where the future is going than simply observing the entire possibility space opened up by new technologies. When I looked at those failed Google products, I got the impression that Google - founded by Stanford grads - originally sought to be a lot more academic than it is today, with tools for professional research and note-taking. We can understand that these products failed because they weren’t aligned with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, even though they were technically feasible.\n\nSecond, my quick take is that this shift has its roots in society’s search for reciprocal connection. The 21st century is probably the only century that will ever be worth calling ‘the internet century’ (by the 22nd the internet won’t be exciting anymore). Today’s internet is very uni-directional, with big influencers megaphoning to their followers[4](#footnote-4). But people also want to [belong ](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/about#:\\~:text=the%20sense%20of%20belonging%20that%20humans%20inherently%20desire)to something, and as I wrote a few months ago, building connections *[within](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/leading-movements-communicating-change?s=w#:\\~:text=so%20build%20connections-,within,-your%20movement)* your community makes it so much more fulfilling. You feel you’re really participating, and this is really why I go to the sweet shop. Society just invented the internet, and is searching for meaning.

(Kevin Huynh)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7pYdkgZ_QQytonD6G7z0-.webp?height=796&width=1456)\n\n\n---\n\nThe rest of this essay is to explore how this shift is influencing culture. We can think pretty big about *all* the unbundling opportunities new technologies bring: in *[Life After Google](https://www.waterstones.com/book/life-after-google/george-gilder/9781621575764)*, Gilder points out that even money *could* be unbundled, though I don’t think this is on the cards. It’s possible, but consumers don’t actually want to unbundle money into a store of value, unit of account, and so forth. Very few communities are built simply around money as a tool; everyone will *not* become [currency traders](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/12/11/bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-web3-great-protocol-politics/#:\\~:text=everyone%20becomes%20a%20foreign-exchange%20trader); a niche can’t be built around something that everyone uses, and most people don’t care.\n\nI want to instead focus on culture, which people care a lot about, and is interesting for many further reasons. It interests me how great cultural contributions both capture some image of society whilst also moving it forward[5](#footnote-5). Culture is also beautifully adaptable and flexible and fluid, changing rapidly and exhibiting immense diversity of contribution and consumption: it’s a *collection of niches*. I expect this vibe shift to play out in culture very soon. (It goes without saying that this will occur on the internet.)\n\nThat idea of culture as a collection of niches deserves interrogating: culture is also something that we all share. And sure, there will continue to be big Instagram accounts and large supermarkets; shows and books that everyone talks about and events that unite the masses. But as Rex Woodbury notes: “[Celebrities like (Tom) Cruise are a dying breed](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/cultural-transmission-in-the-internet?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NTcwOTkyMTIsIl8iOiJlcTFDOSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDE2NzYxMywiZXhwIjoxNjU0MTcxMjEzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzg1MDAiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.pfK8o_nxyz7FIehX7-CkXaRKa-d0-3YhcJ1I1r_YRkg&s=r#:\\~:text=celebrities%20like%20cruise%20are%20a%20dying%20breed)”[6](#footnote-6). The 2020s will be defined by the “[long tail of creators](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/the-two-way-mirror-of-art-and-technology?s=w#:\\~:text=embolden%20the%20long%20tail%20of%20creators)”, each creating en mass for far smaller communities with much deeper engagement. In the 21st century, we will seek experiences that feel, in some important ways (and not all), totally and emphatically human — that’s why people love [eSports](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-watch-other-people-play-video?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDUxMzUyMzksIl8iOiJrK0hyQSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDIwNjQ5OSwiZXhwIjoxNjU0MjEwMDk5LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzMyOTk2Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.T5f6CkyK7SFpzLO3nZZ6U2Zudqkkf4npc9ZsqDnSqFg&s=r#:\\~:text=as%20totally%20and%20unabashedly%20human); we’re in the moment *with* the players. **For the hobbies and niches that we love, for which we’re far more than mere followers, we’ll find people serving that niche with dedicated communities built around them.**\n\n[Late Checkout](https://latecheckout.studio/about) is an agency that doesn’t deserve the negative tag associated with such companies[7](#footnote-7); they capture the situation perfectly:\n\n> `“The old way of building products was to try and be everything to everyone. Products were chunky, bloated, and didn’t serve the individual or communities.”`\n>\n> `“People want to feel a connection to the products they use. They want the internet to feel human and alive again.”`\n\nIt’s exciting to see people building the future, and culturally we’re going to see exactly this: **content will be built around niche and dedicated communities with genuine human connection**[8](#footnote-8).\n\n\n---\n\n## And thus the 1,000 True Fans thesis eventually manifests.\n\nIn 2008, Kevin Kelly wrote one of the most seminal contributions in culture tech. The founding editor-in-chief of Wired wrote that, in the internet age:\n\n> `“To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans.”`\n\nA thousand dedicated fans who love your niche. Sound familiar? \n\nSo what took so long?\n\nIt’s certainly the case that the technology of the era made this difficult. Kelly hoped that the internet would be the ultimate matchmaker. Bring the creators and the consumers online, and they will find each other. To an extent, they did, especially in the early days of the internet: in 2008, writing about 1000 True Fans looked sensible. But it was still pretty hard: you could publish your own content, but without mass-market services like Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube, that helped you discover, it was tough to find or be found.\n\nThe introduction of these services, monoliths to be, helped in one sense: it was a lot easier for people to find you on the internet. But the price for this matchmaking was almost everything: Facebook and Instagram take almost 100% of all the revenue creators see on their platforms; YouTube takes 45%; Spotify paid an average of merely £700 to each artist last year[9](#footnote-9). These monoliths do the matching, but make it virtually unaffordable to create in the first place.\n\nIt was a vibe shift, not a technological one, that struck the first blow to this impoverished paradigm. Twitch, Kickstarter, Patreon, Substack, amongst many others, are all services built for creators to cater for the dedicated fans of their niche; all built amidst the community-centric vibe shift born in the 2010s. Well before the 2020 crypto bull run, a16z heralded a [100 True Fans model](https://future.a16z.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/) in 2020[10](#footnote-10), arguing that this was made possible with even more niche services from Podia, Teachable, and Kajabi. (These companies *all* help people sell educational courses, which undermines the argument to an extent, but you only need 250 fans paying £20/$25 per month to earn \\~3x the average UK salary or [$75,000](https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html#:\\~:text=no%20matter%20how%20much%20more), so you get the picture.) **With the alignment of technology and the vibe, the impoverished paradigm of community-stricken creatorship is collapsing.**\n\n\n---\n\n### Blockchain is a game-changer for this dynamic\n\n*You’re reading on Mirror, so you probably know all this; you could easily skip to the next phrase in bold.*\n\nIn the early 2020s, new technologies like blockchain, distributed ledgers, and cryptocurrencies really came in vogue. A distributed ledger is triple-entry bookkeeping. [Double-entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping) bookkeeping was invented in medieval Italy: two parties to a transaction would both record it, giving you more data about your business and more verifiable figures, making it easier to trade and pursue enterprise.\n\nEight centuries later, distributed ledgers are triple-entry bookkeeping: as well as the seller and buyer, *every participant in the economy* makes a record of the transaction, and every participant is using the same, enormous, book. Blockchain is the technology of how you add to this book and run software with it, and cryptocurrency is one use case: the ledger essentially records how much currency you own, which everyone verifies. Obviously I’m simplifying, but I’ll refer to these technologies as ‘web3 techs’[11](#footnote-11).\n\nThe significance of blockchain becomes clear upon interrogating why Facebook, YouTube, *et al.* can take such high take rates on creators. One side is [discovery](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does#:\\~:text=no%20one%20finds%20a%20person%20on%20patreon%3B%20you%20go%20there%20after%20you%E2%80%99ve%20found%20them): you rarely *find* creators on Patreon. This happens, still, on big social networks. Everyone is on these platforms (well, not Facebook) and when you consume on these platforms frequently, they’re experts in figuring out what content you’ll click on next; big data, [Markov chains](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-markov-chains-50da3645a50d#:\\~:text=predict%20weather%20for%20days%20to%20come%2C%20based%20on%20what%20the%20current%20weather%20state%20is%20at%20the%20time), etc. There are some problems with this, mainly that you get served addictive content rather than niches that you want to engage deeply in, but generally they do this job pretty well, and web3 techs don’t hugely change this.\n\nBut there are a lot of platforms for discovery — this isn’t the competitive moat it once was. People use Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Pinterest, and much more, in addition to the discovery platforms we’ve called out above; as mentioned, most people have moved beyond Facebook. Creators could just move to whichever discovery network takes the smallest cut of their revenue. Apart from one thing: they can’t. Everything you’ve ever uploaded to Spotify and all the followers you’ve earnt on Insta: the discovery platform manages this, and you can’t take your community with you. So it’s impossible to leave without starting all over again. And hence discovery networks [squeeze](https://stratechery.com/2015/niches-problem-subscription-services/) creators for revenue.\n\nAnd hence, the game-changer. Because just like with your cryptocurrency, you can store your [writing](https://mirror.xyz/), your [music](https://sound.xyz/), your [art](https://opensea.io/), your [videos](https://d.tube/), your [followers](https://lens.xyz/), on a distributed ledger, or “on chain”. As [LBRY](https://lbry.io/) puts it: “LBRY does to publishing what Bitcoin did to money.” Just like with your currency, everyone participating in the economy agrees that “yes, [Leo](https://app.ens.domains/name/leosn.eth/details), you wrote this blog”. Sites like Spotify and Instagram don’t manage your songs and your followers because these songs and follower relationships are stored on chain, and Spotify is reduced to one of many organisations competing to merely display this content in the best way, and help you discover new content as well. Creators are not beholden to any of them – and neither are consumers[12](#footnote-12).\n\nSo now the community economy is fully on the way because finally, **dedicated participants in a niche community can meaningfully support their creators**. When people are deeply engaged in something they care about, even the original consumers become contributors, and we’ll start to see vibrant ecosystems formed around niches and creators. Greg Isenberg explores the [Loot ecosystem](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/heres-what-the-future-of-nfts-looks?s=r#:\\~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20an%20ecosystem%20not%20just%20an%20nft), an NFT project upon which creators have realised myriad different ideas; [Jenkins the Valet](https://www.jenkinsthevalet.com/how-it-works) is a great example of community-led storytelling, which will become a category-defining cultural genre in the 2020s, on par with ‘art’ and ‘literature’. [Jadyn Violet](https://twitter.com/jadynviolet), a musician, told me that “I’ve never got this much interaction on my art before.” He's been spending his time building new ideas to engage his community, spending time speaking with his fans, and making more music — this is what his fans love him for.\n\nBusiness people often talk about the Minimum Viable Product your business needs before you start selling. The MVP isn’t dead, but all businesses (not just creators) will soon require a [Minimum Viable Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uPRruLfZoU&t=2s) to make a mark in their market[13](#footnote-13).\n\nWhat will underlie all of these communities are tokens of membership, probably tiered, which tie a community together. They’ll be non-fungible, which means they’ll be unique and personalisable, thus allowing for deeper engagement. **Consumers get dedicated community and deeper value in a niche they care about; creators are finally rewarded fairly for their work.** \n\n![Tiered NFT collections can help creators build more intimate communities. Everyone wants this; web3 makes it possible.

Google was only just getting started, but after aligning with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, became the favoured search engine of billions.\n\nJoe Kraus, the founder of Excite, [explains why](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=i%20went%20to%20revisit%20joe%20kraus): Excite had been a 20th century company, targeting revenue from the top ten American companies, as media businesses had been doing for decades. Meanwhile, Google focused on attracting advertisers — and millions of them. Why did this work? *“The 20th century was about dozens of markets of millions of consumers. **The 21st century is about millions of markets of dozens of consumers.**”*\n\n\n---\n\n*Hopefully that didn’t actually feel like 3,000 words; I’d love it if you were to [subscribe](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/subscribe) for free or mint one of 5 editions.*\n\n\n---\n\n`Image credits: HelloDorking; Kevin Huynh; Peter Yang`\n\n***Footnotes:***\n\n[1](#footnote-anchor-1) I don’t have the percentage figures for the change in sweetshops and clothing stores, I’m sorry.\n\n[2](#footnote-anchor-2) Other blogging platforms are available, including this one, but they’re still *built* for writers; I’m testing the beta of [Nuance](http://nuance.xyz/).\n\n[3](#footnote-anchor-3) Stratechery anticipated this for (cable) TV in [2013](https://stratechery.com/2013/the-jobs-tv-does/#:\\~:text=the%20jobs%20tv%20has%20traditionally%20done%20include) and watched it happen in [2017](https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/#:\\~:text=tv%20is%20broken%20up%20into%20the%20different%20%E2%80%9Cjobs%E2%80%9D%20it%20has%20traditionally%20done): TV used to keep us **informed**, **educate** us, show **live events**, tell **stories**, and provide **escapism**. But now we get our information from Google; our education from YouTube, Coursera, or Masterworks; our live events from Twitch; our story-telling from Netflix; and our escapism from social media. It’s not as neat as this of course: in reality, everything just exploded into a plethora of mainly mobile options; but unbundling is happening.\n\n[4](#footnote-anchor-4) I number crunched some of the Instagram follower stats [here](https://mention.com/en/reports/instagram/followers/) and would estimate that of all the follower-followee relationships, the largest 1% of accounts receive about 50% of all following relationships.\n\n[5](#footnote-anchor-5) I’m undecided and unclear on what this means for ‘great’ or ‘classic’ cultural contributions. If a great cultural contribution captures an image of society, but also moves it on, how can it be classic, if being classic is continuing to capture that image of society: hasn’t society moved on and been influenced by your contribution? \n\n[6](#footnote-anchor-6) Woodbury is mainly making the argument that it is specifically “a 20th-century culture centered around white leading men” that is dying, but whilst it’s true that celebrities are becoming more diverse, what’s more important is that they’re becoming less relevant. The social media era is dying; the social community era is coming.\n\n[7](#footnote-anchor-7) It’s ironic that in principle ‘agency’ is the most important thing in the world, whilst ‘agencies’ that help brands and creators reach their fans are typically seen as vultures.\n\n[8](#footnote-anchor-8) I also expect niche and tailored content that is ***emphatically artificial***: a further implication of this, from the unrelated and sufficient cause of AI too, is that individuals will asymptote towards consuming cultural content that is tailored just for them: *an audience of one*. As artificial intelligence (which was also covered [last month](http://The asymptote we reach is that for most people, most of the time, their reading and viewing material is created just for them)) gets more able to accurately predict our interests and preferences at a subtle scale, we get to a world in which content is designed – no, generated – to appeal specifically to us. GPT-3 is an OpenAI algorithm that can conduct incredibly lifelike conversation (at times). [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/news/openai-punished-dev-used-gpt-3-to-resurrect-dead-ethics) covers the story of one developer who used the algorithm to sell bots that spoke with the *individual personalities* of an individual chosen by a customer, including dead relatives. As always, there are challenges that accompany change, as well as opportunities; AI will continue to develop, but the risk and threat of AI trained to stimulate and manipulate us need to be managed. *Further reading: [The Diff](https://www.thediff.co/p/what-happens-when-most-media-is-produced?s=r) explores this idea from a more financial perspective; the [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/27/1088140809/fake-linkedin-profiles) illustrates a perfect example, with fake LinkedIn profiles generated explicitly to pique your interest; [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/04/when-your-bot-is-better-than-you.html) touches on the issue from the other perspective, that of the person using the bot.*\n\n[9](#footnote-anchor-9) Sources: Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube stats [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/); in 2021 Spotify paid [$7bn](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) to [8 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) creators, which is $875 or £700 (slightly higher than the claim in the a16z source above).\n\n[10](#footnote-anchor-10) Take the price of Bitcoin as a proxy for ‘web3 in vogue’ for a moment. When a16z published the 100 True Fans articles in February 2020, Bitcoin was worth under <$10k, and wouldn’t get above that price until October. The niche market vibe shift predates the cultural significance of web3 and crypto.\n\n[11](#footnote-anchor-11) I’m simplifying a lot; this isn’t a technical introduction to web3. Most obviously, it’s not the case that each person has to manually agree everything in a distributed ledger. Rather, it’s every computer server; and it’s not every computer server, it’s those who proactively commit to contributing to manage the ledger and communicating with it. A good introductory podcast [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6N7cIUkh0DnADrJpWlzcY3?si=7rj7ns-AQTqwShJvTHRfOQ); a more detailed introduction [here](https://ethereum.org/en/web3/); a more technical and key whitepaper [here](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/); and for more depth I suggest the further reading listed under the whitepaper.\n\n[12](#footnote-anchor-12) This illustrates Vitalik Buterin’s (founder of Ethereum) infamous Uber [quote](https://proxet.com/blog/how-the-blockchain-is-changing-money-and-business/#:\\~:text=%E2%80%9C-,whereas%20,-most%20%20tend%20%20workers): taxi profiles will be stored on chain, and Uber, Lyft, and more will compete to show you the same drivers, giving the drivers much more power and compensation — which they [need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_resource_theory). *(There we go, I actually got a politics link in.)*\n\n[13](#footnote-anchor-13) This idea comes from Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit.

This process operates at every level of life — the goals just shift based on local context and conditions.\n\nAt the human level, each of us pursue our own goals and sense-make for ourselves. We individually construct an interpretation of our experience according to our own central nervous system and consciousness.\n\nIt’s only in relation to other human beings that we have to contend with the goals of other individuals. And it’s there where shared or competing goals are determined.\n\nSocially, we’re aided by shared languaging (the totality of our intercommunications) and the emergent culture surrounding us, which further scaffolds, frames, and constrains our individual experience of sense-making.\n\nOur personal realities are relative, subject to the localized information available to one’s consciousness in each moment. But through languaging and conversation, we explore our intersubjective experiences of the world together.\n\nConversation is used to explore potential solutions to perceived problems. If an intersubjective, shared meaning can be established, a foundation for collaborative sense-making and storytelling can be built upon. Agreement might be found.\n\nHowever, if the “maps of meaning” aren’t agreed upon, the definition of the “problem”, defined as one’s distance from the imagined goal, also can’t be agreed upon and collaborative progress won’t be made.\n\nThe conversation will be deemed unproductive and impractical relative to one’s goal and violence will be inevitable.\n\nWhen each party’s perspective is based on the belief that “facts” exist, independent of observers, it leads to entrenched positions. Reason no longer works.\n\nNew “facts” aren't accepted because the framing of those facts is entangled in the subjective scaffolding of the individual and the emergent cultural context they’re embedded within.\n\nThe other observer is embedded in a different “reality.” The information of their intersubjective experience is only accessible to them and like-minded others.\n\nGood faith conversation between parties with opposing viewpoints remains our only hope for resolution, but no shared agreement should be expected.\n\nThe distance between consciousnesses and their sense-making, the perceived problems to be solved, and the culture that enmeshes these experiences, is too great.\n\nBut we have to keep trying.", "timestamp": 1654285072, "digest": "9S3o9qwoYrN9XQCOGh9asSnY5nfE4-hgTGs-pPVntME", "contributor": "0x16c3676077017b856dFF4514170332abD7dC2729"}

Specifically, these Victorian-themed tuckshops and sweet connoisseurs, plucked from two hundred years prior and plopped in the middle of a high street that doesn’t quite know how to welcome its new tenant. One of the sweet shops near me plasters ‘Toys, Trains, Treats” on dated storefront panelling; it’s the shop you thought your grandparents went to when they were young, except the steam trains on sale are battery powered.\n\nThis wasn’t just a Baader–Meinhof [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion), where upon seeing something once you perceive it everywhere. During the first year of the pandemic, an extra [73](https://www.mylondon.news/news/uk-world-news/i-visited-londons-new-dangerous-22961908#:\\~:text=73%20more%20sweet%20shops%20in%20the%20uk%20compared%20with%202020) sweetshops popped up in the UK, net, according to the Local Data Company. That’s not a huge number, but it’s pretty significant given the broader lockdown context; the total number of clothing shops fell by 1,236 in the same period[1](#footnote-1). The shop near me was set up in September ‘21. It begs the question: what’s so special about sweet shops?\n\nI had spent my Saturday morning at Waterstones buying some books, at the sweet shop questioning the shop assistant, and now I’m writing about it on Substack. In days gone by, I would have bought my physical items at Sainsbury’s and, in comparison to today, where I have my Substack and my main [website](https://www.leonasskau.co.uk/), all my digital publishing would be through the same technology stack, probably Wordpress.\n\nSweets are nice, but the real difference is the existence of a shop that will focus all of its resources on their specific niche product. I bought some weird caramel chocolate flakes that defy description, but they were excellent. I certainly paid a premium, but next time I want sweets, I’ll go there again, because *they know their product*; I just bought what the shop assistant recommended. At Waterstone’s, I picked up [Train Dreams](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/13/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review) because I told the manager I was after contemporary fiction; I use Substack because it’s built for writers[2](#footnote-2). **What makes these businesses special is that they serve *niche markets in which they can give people much deeper value.***\n\n![I mean, you get what I’m saying, despite the weird animojis, right? (HelloDorking)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xRINH9-26W7ZvCggFpXtm.jpeg?height=2438&width=3024)\n\n## Unbundling into niches\n\nBundling and unbundling are [not new concepts](https://hbr.org/1999/03/unbundling-the-corporation). It’s a pretty simple convection model: you start with a business, over time you add more products, services, and features, and then you get bloated, do everything ‘kinda well’, until a niche competitor comes along and does *one* of your services *really really well*, and bit by bit you get pieced apart. The [complexity convection](https://every.to/divinations/complexity-convection-765851) is a pattern that cannot be unseen. \n\nPeople have observed this happening to our contemporary digital landscape for about a decade, beginning in practice much earlier. Craigslist was [unbundled](https://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/345941486/the-spawn-of-craigslist-like-most-vcs-that-focus) into many things, including Reddit, which is now being [unbundled](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/the-guide-to-unbundling-reddit?s=r) into many more things, like Nextdoor. In the language of [a16z](https://a16z.com/2019/09/11/platforms-verticals-unbundling/), the famed tech investors: platforms get unbundled into verticals, which turn into platforms, at which point the cycle resumes, and all of a sudden I’ve turned into a strategy writer[3](#footnote-3). \n\nI’m not the first to herald this unbundling in the physical world either. Peter Day [wrote](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=Economy%2C%20%20almost%20a,speed%20and%20efficiency.) an excellent essay predicting “the heartbeat economy, almost a concierge approach to customers,” in 2013:\n\n> `“This would be a worryingly intimate relationship for many businesses, but one which might provide a new kind of rewarding marketplace if they dared to be far closer to their customers' individuality.”`\n\nHe wrote about it in the BBC, but today he would write on his own blog.\n\nMy real contribution is to note that this challenges why unbundling and bundling happens at all. The main idea behind why we sway between bundled and unbundled products is the [underlying technology](https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling#:\\~:text=a%20lot%20of%20it%20is%20based%20on%20the%20underlying%20technology%20change). Marc Andreesen, co-founder of a16z and of [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)), the first web browser, talks through the concept of the newspaper:\n\n> `“The newspaper bundle, the idea of this slug of news and sports scores and classifieds and stock quotes that arrives once a day was a consequence of the printing plant, of the distribution network for newspapers using trucks and newsstands, and the famous newspaper delivery boy. That newspaper bundle was based on the distribution technology of a time and place.`\n>\n> `When the distribution technology changed with the internet, there was going to be the great unwind, and then the great rebundle, in the form of Google and Facebook and Twitter.”`\n\nThis is certainly true: we could only put [live events on Twitch](https://youtu.be/TCPjk8Tpb5c?t=1025) after network infrastructure made it cheap enough to broadcast live video around the world.\n\nBut it’s no coincidence that physical businesses are unbundling at the same time as digital ones, despite relying on different technologies, and often very little tech at all. Neither technology nor innovations built upon it come from magic: what consumers *actually want* plays a key role; today it’s driven by the niche market vibe shift.\n\nWhy? Well first, consumer demand fosters technological innovation. I took a cursory glance at solar panels [last month](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/podcast-discussion-negotiating-our?s=w#:\\~:text=we%E2%80%99re%20already%20on%20the%20way.%20solar%2C%20wind%2C%20fusion%2C%20geothermal%2C%20and%20hydrogen%20energy%20technologies%20have%20all%20advanced%20significantly%20even%20in%20the%20past%20decade.), where growing consumer demand and growing production have *induced* new technologies; if people hadn’t bothered to use streaming services in the early days, there wouldn’t have been the investment that made them possible at scale. Substack was built because its founders [believed](https://every.to/divinations/substack-s-ideology) writers wanted to offer readers deeper value in a specific niche - and that [readers would pay for it](https://twitter.com/hamishmckenzie/status/1532432557513404416) – not due to any new technologies, just due to the niche market vibe shift.\n\nSecond, even when this technological innovation happens, there is no rule commanding consumers to use every new use case that’s suddenly made possible. Google, Facebook, and Twitter all had to create new bundles that people actually wanted to use: do [Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B), [Google Answers](http://answers.google.com/answers/faq.html#:\\~:text=google%20answers%20was%20an%20experimental%20product%20for%20users%20to%20get%20help%20from%20researchers%20with%20expertise%20in%20online%20searching.), or [Google Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Notebook#:\\~:text=allowed%20users%20to%20save%20and%20organize%20clips%20of%20information%20while%20conducting%20research%20online) ring a bell?\n\n**I think the reason I’m seeing more sweetshops around is because of a niche market vibe shift. The technology for serving more niche communities has always existed, but now consumers actually want it. *But what does this mean?***\n\n\n---\n\nI have two quick points before we move on: why this insight is important and why this shift is happening.\n\nFirst, understanding that bundling and unbundling cycles sway partly due to social preferences, as well as technology, is important to understanding where these sways stop and start, and how to take advantage of them. If it’s true that people want more meaningful, participatory communities, that tells us a lot more about where the future is going than simply observing the entire possibility space opened up by new technologies. When I looked at those failed Google products, I got the impression that Google - founded by Stanford grads - originally sought to be a lot more academic than it is today, with tools for professional research and note-taking. We can understand that these products failed because they weren’t aligned with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, even though they were technically feasible.\n\nSecond, my quick take is that this shift has its roots in society’s search for reciprocal connection. The 21st century is probably the only century that will ever be worth calling ‘the internet century’ (by the 22nd the internet won’t be exciting anymore). Today’s internet is very uni-directional, with big influencers megaphoning to their followers[4](#footnote-4). But people also want to [belong ](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/about#:\\~:text=the%20sense%20of%20belonging%20that%20humans%20inherently%20desire)to something, and as I wrote a few months ago, building connections *[within](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/p/leading-movements-communicating-change?s=w#:\\~:text=so%20build%20connections-,within,-your%20movement)* your community makes it so much more fulfilling. You feel you’re really participating, and this is really why I go to the sweet shop. Society just invented the internet, and is searching for meaning.

(Kevin Huynh)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7pYdkgZ_QQytonD6G7z0-.webp?height=796&width=1456)\n\n\n---\n\nThe rest of this essay is to explore how this shift is influencing culture. We can think pretty big about *all* the unbundling opportunities new technologies bring: in *[Life After Google](https://www.waterstones.com/book/life-after-google/george-gilder/9781621575764)*, Gilder points out that even money *could* be unbundled, though I don’t think this is on the cards. It’s possible, but consumers don’t actually want to unbundle money into a store of value, unit of account, and so forth. Very few communities are built simply around money as a tool; everyone will *not* become [currency traders](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/12/11/bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-web3-great-protocol-politics/#:\\~:text=everyone%20becomes%20a%20foreign-exchange%20trader); a niche can’t be built around something that everyone uses, and most people don’t care.\n\nI want to instead focus on culture, which people care a lot about, and is interesting for many further reasons. It interests me how great cultural contributions both capture some image of society whilst also moving it forward[5](#footnote-5). Culture is also beautifully adaptable and flexible and fluid, changing rapidly and exhibiting immense diversity of contribution and consumption: it’s a *collection of niches*. I expect this vibe shift to play out in culture very soon. (It goes without saying that this will occur on the internet.)\n\nThat idea of culture as a collection of niches deserves interrogating: culture is also something that we all share. And sure, there will continue to be big Instagram accounts and large supermarkets; shows and books that everyone talks about and events that unite the masses. But as Rex Woodbury notes: “[Celebrities like (Tom) Cruise are a dying breed](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/cultural-transmission-in-the-internet?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NTcwOTkyMTIsIl8iOiJlcTFDOSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDE2NzYxMywiZXhwIjoxNjU0MTcxMjEzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzg1MDAiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.pfK8o_nxyz7FIehX7-CkXaRKa-d0-3YhcJ1I1r_YRkg&s=r#:\\~:text=celebrities%20like%20cruise%20are%20a%20dying%20breed)”[6](#footnote-6). The 2020s will be defined by the “[long tail of creators](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/the-two-way-mirror-of-art-and-technology?s=w#:\\~:text=embolden%20the%20long%20tail%20of%20creators)”, each creating en mass for far smaller communities with much deeper engagement. In the 21st century, we will seek experiences that feel, in some important ways (and not all), totally and emphatically human — that’s why people love [eSports](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-watch-other-people-play-video?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo1NjA2MzgyNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDUxMzUyMzksIl8iOiJrK0hyQSIsImlhdCI6MTY1NDIwNjQ5OSwiZXhwIjoxNjU0MjEwMDk5LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMzMyOTk2Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.T5f6CkyK7SFpzLO3nZZ6U2Zudqkkf4npc9ZsqDnSqFg&s=r#:\\~:text=as%20totally%20and%20unabashedly%20human); we’re in the moment *with* the players. **For the hobbies and niches that we love, for which we’re far more than mere followers, we’ll find people serving that niche with dedicated communities built around them.**\n\n[Late Checkout](https://latecheckout.studio/about) is an agency that doesn’t deserve the negative tag associated with such companies[7](#footnote-7); they capture the situation perfectly:\n\n> `“The old way of building products was to try and be everything to everyone. Products were chunky, bloated, and didn’t serve the individual or communities.”`\n>\n> `“People want to feel a connection to the products they use. They want the internet to feel human and alive again.”`\n\nIt’s exciting to see people building the future, and culturally we’re going to see exactly this: **content will be built around niche and dedicated communities with genuine human connection**[8](#footnote-8).\n\n\n---\n\n## And thus the 1,000 True Fans thesis eventually manifests.\n\nIn 2008, Kevin Kelly wrote one of the most seminal contributions in culture tech. The founding editor-in-chief of Wired wrote that, in the internet age:\n\n> `“To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans.”`\n\nA thousand dedicated fans who love your niche. Sound familiar? \n\nSo what took so long?\n\nIt’s certainly the case that the technology of the era made this difficult. Kelly hoped that the internet would be the ultimate matchmaker. Bring the creators and the consumers online, and they will find each other. To an extent, they did, especially in the early days of the internet: in 2008, writing about 1000 True Fans looked sensible. But it was still pretty hard: you could publish your own content, but without mass-market services like Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube, that helped you discover, it was tough to find or be found.\n\nThe introduction of these services, monoliths to be, helped in one sense: it was a lot easier for people to find you on the internet. But the price for this matchmaking was almost everything: Facebook and Instagram take almost 100% of all the revenue creators see on their platforms; YouTube takes 45%; Spotify paid an average of merely £700 to each artist last year[9](#footnote-9). These monoliths do the matching, but make it virtually unaffordable to create in the first place.\n\nIt was a vibe shift, not a technological one, that struck the first blow to this impoverished paradigm. Twitch, Kickstarter, Patreon, Substack, amongst many others, are all services built for creators to cater for the dedicated fans of their niche; all built amidst the community-centric vibe shift born in the 2010s. Well before the 2020 crypto bull run, a16z heralded a [100 True Fans model](https://future.a16z.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/) in 2020[10](#footnote-10), arguing that this was made possible with even more niche services from Podia, Teachable, and Kajabi. (These companies *all* help people sell educational courses, which undermines the argument to an extent, but you only need 250 fans paying £20/$25 per month to earn \\~3x the average UK salary or [$75,000](https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html#:\\~:text=no%20matter%20how%20much%20more), so you get the picture.) **With the alignment of technology and the vibe, the impoverished paradigm of community-stricken creatorship is collapsing.**\n\n\n---\n\n### Blockchain is a game-changer for this dynamic\n\n*You’re reading on Mirror, so you probably know all this; you could easily skip to the next phrase in bold.*\n\nIn the early 2020s, new technologies like blockchain, distributed ledgers, and cryptocurrencies really came in vogue. A distributed ledger is triple-entry bookkeeping. [Double-entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping) bookkeeping was invented in medieval Italy: two parties to a transaction would both record it, giving you more data about your business and more verifiable figures, making it easier to trade and pursue enterprise.\n\nEight centuries later, distributed ledgers are triple-entry bookkeeping: as well as the seller and buyer, *every participant in the economy* makes a record of the transaction, and every participant is using the same, enormous, book. Blockchain is the technology of how you add to this book and run software with it, and cryptocurrency is one use case: the ledger essentially records how much currency you own, which everyone verifies. Obviously I’m simplifying, but I’ll refer to these technologies as ‘web3 techs’[11](#footnote-11).\n\nThe significance of blockchain becomes clear upon interrogating why Facebook, YouTube, *et al.* can take such high take rates on creators. One side is [discovery](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does#:\\~:text=no%20one%20finds%20a%20person%20on%20patreon%3B%20you%20go%20there%20after%20you%E2%80%99ve%20found%20them): you rarely *find* creators on Patreon. This happens, still, on big social networks. Everyone is on these platforms (well, not Facebook) and when you consume on these platforms frequently, they’re experts in figuring out what content you’ll click on next; big data, [Markov chains](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-markov-chains-50da3645a50d#:\\~:text=predict%20weather%20for%20days%20to%20come%2C%20based%20on%20what%20the%20current%20weather%20state%20is%20at%20the%20time), etc. There are some problems with this, mainly that you get served addictive content rather than niches that you want to engage deeply in, but generally they do this job pretty well, and web3 techs don’t hugely change this.\n\nBut there are a lot of platforms for discovery — this isn’t the competitive moat it once was. People use Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Pinterest, and much more, in addition to the discovery platforms we’ve called out above; as mentioned, most people have moved beyond Facebook. Creators could just move to whichever discovery network takes the smallest cut of their revenue. Apart from one thing: they can’t. Everything you’ve ever uploaded to Spotify and all the followers you’ve earnt on Insta: the discovery platform manages this, and you can’t take your community with you. So it’s impossible to leave without starting all over again. And hence discovery networks [squeeze](https://stratechery.com/2015/niches-problem-subscription-services/) creators for revenue.\n\nAnd hence, the game-changer. Because just like with your cryptocurrency, you can store your [writing](https://mirror.xyz/), your [music](https://sound.xyz/), your [art](https://opensea.io/), your [videos](https://d.tube/), your [followers](https://lens.xyz/), on a distributed ledger, or “on chain”. As [LBRY](https://lbry.io/) puts it: “LBRY does to publishing what Bitcoin did to money.” Just like with your currency, everyone participating in the economy agrees that “yes, [Leo](https://app.ens.domains/name/leosn.eth/details), you wrote this blog”. Sites like Spotify and Instagram don’t manage your songs and your followers because these songs and follower relationships are stored on chain, and Spotify is reduced to one of many organisations competing to merely display this content in the best way, and help you discover new content as well. Creators are not beholden to any of them – and neither are consumers[12](#footnote-12).\n\nSo now the community economy is fully on the way because finally, **dedicated participants in a niche community can meaningfully support their creators**. When people are deeply engaged in something they care about, even the original consumers become contributors, and we’ll start to see vibrant ecosystems formed around niches and creators. Greg Isenberg explores the [Loot ecosystem](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/heres-what-the-future-of-nfts-looks?s=r#:\\~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20an%20ecosystem%20not%20just%20an%20nft), an NFT project upon which creators have realised myriad different ideas; [Jenkins the Valet](https://www.jenkinsthevalet.com/how-it-works) is a great example of community-led storytelling, which will become a category-defining cultural genre in the 2020s, on par with ‘art’ and ‘literature’. [Jadyn Violet](https://twitter.com/jadynviolet), a musician, told me that “I’ve never got this much interaction on my art before.” He's been spending his time building new ideas to engage his community, spending time speaking with his fans, and making more music — this is what his fans love him for.\n\nBusiness people often talk about the Minimum Viable Product your business needs before you start selling. The MVP isn’t dead, but all businesses (not just creators) will soon require a [Minimum Viable Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uPRruLfZoU&t=2s) to make a mark in their market[13](#footnote-13).\n\nWhat will underlie all of these communities are tokens of membership, probably tiered, which tie a community together. They’ll be non-fungible, which means they’ll be unique and personalisable, thus allowing for deeper engagement. **Consumers get dedicated community and deeper value in a niche they care about; creators are finally rewarded fairly for their work.** \n\n![Tiered NFT collections can help creators build more intimate communities. Everyone wants this; web3 makes it possible.

Google was only just getting started, but after aligning with the niche market vibe shift of the 21st century, became the favoured search engine of billions.\n\nJoe Kraus, the founder of Excite, [explains why](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23990211#:\\~:text=i%20went%20to%20revisit%20joe%20kraus): Excite had been a 20th century company, targeting revenue from the top ten American companies, as media businesses had been doing for decades. Meanwhile, Google focused on attracting advertisers — and millions of them. Why did this work? *“The 20th century was about dozens of markets of millions of consumers. **The 21st century is about millions of markets of dozens of consumers.**”*\n\n\n---\n\n*Hopefully that didn’t actually feel like 3,000 words; I’d love it if you were to [subscribe](https://empoweredbelonging.substack.com/subscribe) for free or mint one of 5 editions.*\n\n\n---\n\n`Image credits: HelloDorking; Kevin Huynh; Peter Yang`\n\n***Footnotes:***\n\n*Mirror doesn’t do footnote links well yet, but I couldn’t bear to publish without them.*\n\n[1](#footnote-anchor-1) I don’t have the percentage figures for the change in sweetshops and clothing stores, I’m sorry.\n\n[2](#footnote-anchor-2) Other blogging platforms are available, including this one, but they’re still *built* for writers; I’m testing the beta of [Nuance](http://nuance.xyz/).\n\n[3](#footnote-anchor-3) Stratechery anticipated this for (cable) TV in [2013](https://stratechery.com/2013/the-jobs-tv-does/#:\\~:text=the%20jobs%20tv%20has%20traditionally%20done%20include) and watched it happen in [2017](https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/#:\\~:text=tv%20is%20broken%20up%20into%20the%20different%20%E2%80%9Cjobs%E2%80%9D%20it%20has%20traditionally%20done): TV used to keep us **informed**, **educate** us, show **live events**, tell **stories**, and provide **escapism**. But now we get our information from Google; our education from YouTube, Coursera, or Masterworks; our live events from Twitch; our story-telling from Netflix; and our escapism from social media. It’s not as neat as this of course: in reality, everything just exploded into a plethora of mainly mobile options; but unbundling is happening.\n\n[4](#footnote-anchor-4) I number crunched some of the Instagram follower stats [here](https://mention.com/en/reports/instagram/followers/) and would estimate that of all the follower-followee relationships, the largest 1% of accounts receive about 50% of all following relationships.\n\n[5](#footnote-anchor-5) I’m undecided and unclear on what this means for ‘great’ or ‘classic’ cultural contributions. If a great cultural contribution captures an image of society, but also moves it on, how can it be classic, if being classic is continuing to capture that image of society: hasn’t society moved on and been influenced by your contribution? \n\n[6](#footnote-anchor-6) Woodbury is mainly making the argument that it is specifically “a 20th-century culture centered around white leading men” that is dying, but whilst it’s true that celebrities are becoming more diverse, what’s more important is that they’re becoming less relevant. The social media era is dying; the social community era is coming.\n\n[7](#footnote-anchor-7) It’s ironic that in principle ‘agency’ is the most important thing in the world, whilst ‘agencies’ that help brands and creators reach their fans are typically seen as vultures.\n\n[8](#footnote-anchor-8) I also expect niche and tailored content that is ***emphatically artificial***: a further implication of this, from the unrelated and sufficient cause of AI too, is that individuals will asymptote towards consuming cultural content that is tailored just for them: *an audience of one*. As artificial intelligence (which was also covered [last month](http://The asymptote we reach is that for most people, most of the time, their reading and viewing material is created just for them)) gets more able to accurately predict our interests and preferences at a subtle scale, we get to a world in which content is designed – no, generated – to appeal specifically to us. GPT-3 is an OpenAI algorithm that can conduct incredibly lifelike conversation (at times). [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/news/openai-punished-dev-used-gpt-3-to-resurrect-dead-ethics) covers the story of one developer who used the algorithm to sell bots that spoke with the *individual personalities* of an individual chosen by a customer, including dead relatives. As always, there are challenges that accompany change, as well as opportunities; AI will continue to develop, but the risk and threat of AI trained to stimulate and manipulate us need to be managed. *Further reading: [The Diff](https://www.thediff.co/p/what-happens-when-most-media-is-produced?s=r) explores this idea from a more financial perspective; the [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/27/1088140809/fake-linkedin-profiles) illustrates a perfect example, with fake LinkedIn profiles generated explicitly to pique your interest; [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/04/when-your-bot-is-better-than-you.html) touches on the issue from the other perspective, that of the person using the bot.*\n\n[9](#footnote-anchor-9) Sources: Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube stats [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/); in 2021 Spotify paid [$7bn](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) to [8 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/03/24/spotify-says-it-paid-7-billion-in-royalties-in-2021-amid-claims-of-low-pay-from-artists/) creators, which is $875 or £700 (slightly higher than the claim in the a16z source above).\n\n[10](#footnote-anchor-10) Take the price of Bitcoin as a proxy for ‘web3 in vogue’ for a moment. When a16z published the 100 True Fans articles in February 2020, Bitcoin was worth under <$10k, and wouldn’t get above that price until October. The niche market vibe shift predates the cultural significance of web3 and crypto.\n\n[11](#footnote-anchor-11) I’m simplifying a lot; this isn’t a technical introduction to web3. Most obviously, it’s not the case that each person has to manually agree everything in a distributed ledger. Rather, it’s every computer server; and it’s not every computer server, it’s those who proactively commit to contributing to manage the ledger and communicating with it.

{"id": "21606-NPa0rQtguhKOM0xHBU94Z8QiCyci75vi7zkxE", "title": "Will P2E NFTs evolve into overpriced loot boxes?", "body": "## Long story short, yes, or rather maybe…\n\nYes I know that is as vague as it can be, but let’s try to untangle the non-existing regulation around NFTs and what some recent development in European legislation could mean to the emerging market of NFTs.\n\nWe need to consider two things:\n\n* Are pre-reveal PFP and P2E NFTs loot boxes?\n* If yes, would the loot box legislation apply to them?\n\n### So can we consider NFTs as loot boxes?\n\nWe can and we should.\n\n> Loot boxes are a feature within video games that allow players to partake in a game of chance, exchanging real world money for a randomised in-game item or benefit.\n\nIn this definition our pre-reveal NFTs could be considered randomized in-game items, especially if they are part of a P2E game, given their attributes are randomly generated from legendary 1/1s to uncommon 10000/1s, which would also constitute a game of chance aspect. Can we say that we can exchange these P2E NFTs for real-world money? Of course, even if the P2E game uses a niche crypto token to purchase these NFTs, we still can exchange our tokens for cash on any CEX and vice-versa.\n\n### So would the loot box apply to the NFT market?\n\nProbably would change how we reveal NFTs, but the market as a whole won’t be regulated anytime soon.\n\nThe most recent addition to the not-so-long list of loot box-related regulations comes as consumer groups in 18 European countries jointly announced that they will launch a coordinated call to action to pass regulations on the despicable practices around loot boxes. The 59=page long report details key issues with loot boxes and their mechanism, a few for the sake of understanding the issue:\n\n* Exploiting cognitive biases and vulnerabilities through deceptive design\n* Using aggressive marketing practices to push sales at every opportunity\n* Using layers of virtual currencies to mask or distort real-world monetary costs\n\nEven before the years of the pandemic-induced chaos around the world, legislators tried to look into the issue at hand, most notably in Belgium where EA had to stop selling FIFA points, and in the Netherlands, the company was fined 500,000€ each week they continued selling loot boxes in their games (this decision has been since ruled as unjustified). Following the BENELUX success, the UK government also started a multi-year investigation on whether they could change the gambling legislation to regulate loot boxes accordingly. This was recently published as an overview by the House of Commons Library;\n\n* In September 2019, a House of Commons Committee published a report on technologies that called for regulations to be made to extend the 2005 Act to loot boxes.\n* In June 2020, the Government announced that it would be launching a call for evidence into the impact of loot boxes on gambling-like behavior.\n* A July 2020 House of Lords Committee report on gambling harm also called for loot boxes to be brought within the scope of the Act.\n* On 19 May 2022, the Government said a gambling white paper would be published in the “coming weeks”.\n\nIf we look at these common issues with loot box mechanisms in the video games industry we can see why they would apply to the current P2E market. Imagine a virtual world where you earn or buy virtual tokens that you can exchange for in-game characters or features, this would be per definition the loot box mechanism that the legislators are trying to regulate to keep children safe. In this regards the general PFP market might also fall into this category.\n\n### What can we do about it?\n\nWhile the legislators are working on actually taking care of this problem that is now part of most video games, the NFT market should self-regulate and try to come up with a better solution for pre-reveal PFP NFTs and purchasable P2E NFTs.\n\nDo I have a solution? No.\n\nDo I believe in NFT technology? Yes.", "timestamp": 1654286065, "digest": "t4yQdRwk_ylrk8A6g9dnKqfhy-cr-zVEUeUzv1crb8o", "contributor": "0xC958366ed7225f86D530b8842922e976ABB17974"}

Giao dịch cầu nối này kích hoạt chức năng xác nhận trước vi phạm bằng một tập điều kiện bắt buộc phải thông qua trước khi được phê duyệt. Một trong những điều kiện đấy là khả năng thanh toán của cầu nối giúp đảm bảo rằng khoản đặt cọc và tài sản khoá phải bằng giá trị với những tài sản chuyển đổi.\n\nĐáng tiếc là phương thức cầu nối này có một lỗ hổng trong mã nguồn đã cho phép những kẻ lợi dụng tạo ra thông điệp giả và khai thác tài sản trên chuỗi đích mà không cung cấp đủ tài sản thế chấp trên chuỗi nguồn.

This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market.

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem : Removing the Gatekeepers to Funding Craft Cannabis Operators**\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption.

We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance.

{"id": "-Gqtkwz93Bqer3SpUu8-FHv4PNIUFwoomOG-FrP-g_M", "title": "Will P2E NFTs evolve into overpriced loot boxes?", "body": "## Long story short, yes, or rather maybe…\n\nYes I know that is as vague as it can be, but let’s try to untangle the non-existing regulation around NFTs and what some recent development in European legislation could mean to the emerging market of NFTs.\n\nWe need to consider two things:\n\n* Are pre-reveal PFP and P2E NFTs loot boxes?\n* If yes, would the loot box legislation apply to them?\n\n### So can we consider NFTs as loot boxes?\n\nWe can and we should.\n\n> Loot boxes are a feature within video games that allow players to partake in a game of chance, exchanging real world money for a randomised in-game item or benefit.\n\nIn this definition our pre-reveal NFTs could be considered randomized in-game items, especially if they are part of a P2E game, given their attributes are randomly generated from legendary 1/1s to uncommon 10000/1s, which would also constitute a game of chance aspect. Can we say that we can exchange these P2E NFTs for real-world money? Of course, even if the P2E game uses a niche crypto token to purchase these NFTs, we still can exchange our tokens for cash on any CEX and vice-versa.\n\n### So would the loot box apply to the NFT market?\n\nProbably would change how we reveal NFTs, but the market as a whole won’t be regulated anytime soon.\n\nThe most recent addition to the not-so-long list of loot box-related regulations comes as consumer groups in 18 European countries jointly announced that they will launch a coordinated call to action to pass regulations on the despicable practices around loot boxes. The 59=page long report details key issues with loot boxes and their mechanism, a few for the sake of understanding the issue:\n\n* Exploiting cognitive biases and vulnerabilities through deceptive design\n* Using aggressive marketing practices to push sales at every opportunity\n* Using layers of virtual currencies to mask or distort real-world monetary costs\n\nEven before the years of the pandemic-induced chaos around the world, legislators tried to look into the issue at hand, most notably in Belgium where EA had to stop selling FIFA points, and in the Netherlands, the company was fined 500,000€ each week they continued selling loot boxes in their games (this decision has been since ruled as unjustified). Following the BENELUX success, the UK government also started a multi-year investigation on whether they could change the gambling legislation to regulate loot boxes accordingly. This was recently published as an overview by the House of Commons Library;\n\n* In September 2019, a House of Commons Committee published a report on technologies that called for regulations to be made to extend the 2005 Act to loot boxes.\n* In June 2020, the Government announced that it would be launching a call for evidence into the impact of loot boxes on gambling-like behavior.\n* A July 2020 House of Lords Committee report on gambling harm also called for loot boxes to be brought within the scope of the Act.\n* On 19 May 2022, the Government said a gambling white paper would be published in the “coming weeks”.\n\nIf we look at these common issues with loot box mechanisms in the video games industry we can see why they would apply to the current P2E market. Imagine a virtual world where you earn or buy virtual tokens that you can exchange for in-game characters or features, this would be per definition the loot box mechanism that the legislators are trying to regulate to keep children safe. In this regards the general PFP market might also fall into this category.\n\n### What can we do about it?\n\nWhile the legislators are working on actually taking care of this problem that is now part of most video games, the NFT market should self-regulate and try to come up with a better solution for pre-reveal PFP NFTs and purchasable P2E NFTs.\n\nDo I have a solution? No.\n\nDo I believe in NFT technology? Yes.\n\n> P.S.: Sorry for making this article an NFT, just wanted to try this functionality out.", "timestamp": 1654286199, "digest": "x6_yoG2s8XnpAddchcAdF7qkMKE86b88_pj4-VBiCTM", "contributor": "0xC958366ed7225f86D530b8842922e976ABB17974"}
{"id": "lqWALXe8B_gmU7lqkklkPa-41bEeLQbdwo6wj3df-48", "title": "THE FOOLISHNESS OF PRIDE: AN ESSAY ON CANCEL CULTURE", "body": "What do you think of when I say the words ‘Cancel Culture’?\n\nYou’ll feel some kind of way about it. You’ll either posit that it doesn’t exist (that the cultural practice of ‘cancelling’ is a form of accountability and consequences for bad behavior), that it does exist but isn’t that big of a deal, or that it is a huge cultural problem. At any rate, you have a neuronal pattern that lights up inside of your brain when you process the english word pairing ‘cancel’ and ‘culture’ in immediate succession. Let me extend that for you.\n\nWhether or not ‘cancel culture’ exists does not change the fact that a pattern of consciousness has entered our awareness and we are attempting to name it. We don’t necessarily have clean lines and clear boundaries around what this thing *is*, but enough of us have bumped up against it in some capacity that there’s a collective ‘sense’ that something new is here. There’s some kind of force at work in people, for any number of reasons. Maybe it’s the way that social media incentives are designed; maybe it’s the way that our modes of production have systematically disempowered the vast majority of participants in ‘the market’ and made us feel like collective vitriol is our only recourse in moments of injustice; maybe it’s a general lack of emotional and intellectual maturity in the average user – myself included – leading us to quickly shout unkind hyperbole in the wake of ‘the latest drama’. It’s probably all of these things, but it’s also something deeper and more insidious than that.\n\nCancel Culture is an *Egregore*. Strap in.\n\nThe word *[egregore ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore)*refers to an esoteric concept that was introduced to me by the astrologer [Fairlie Theta](https://thatastrologer.medium.com/). She explained it to mean “an emergent force created and existing through the intellect of large groups of individuals”. It’s like a creature – some kind of semi-divine entity whose body is not physical, but rather, psychological. It exists via distributed thought patterns; it is the embodiment of a meme. While you can’t see it with your eyes, you could if you had some kind of x-ray vision and could pull your focus back a few miles; it’s body is literally the thought patterns that exist in many peoples’ minds simultaneously. Our physical bodies become its cellular loco-motors, our vocal cords and fingertips become its viral vectors, and it does its work on society by hijacking our social incentives and changing our behavior patterns to suit its proliferation.\n\nIt may be useful to define *[meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme)* here as well; in an academic sense, memes (and their accompanying field of research known as *mimetics*) describe self-replicating information that spreads through human communication. The atheist and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins coined the term to deliberately mirror the concept of genes and genetics; whereas genes are bits of *physical* information that self-replicate (through biochemistry), memes are *psychological* or *intellectual* bits of information that self-replicate. When we share a silly video online and suddenly it spirals out into remixes and new interpretations, we are watching the process of mimetic evolution take place in real time. In certain contexts, memes can become totally untethered from their inciting ‘thought’, and can distort existing social incentives to become world-shaping forces of good and evil. Religion is a meme; democracy, too. Memes are a useful tool for understanding the anthropological relationships we all experience in a global society. The concept of the Egregore is a bit like personifying a specific meme-pattern. You take a meme, and you imbue it with being, as though it has a primal intelligence all its own.\n\n*It’s my opinion that, by imbuing an otherwise abstract but observable pattern such as ‘cancel culture’ with a primal intelligence, we become better able to think of ways to productively relate to the concept.* We as individuals only have agency to address something like ‘cancel culture’ in so far as we are able to understand it as a process that operates under its own logic and desire to persist. Ergo, Egregore.\n\n“The Egregore of Cancel Culture” is a bit of a mouthful, though. Let’s condense that to its essence: What human emotion is most at work when we talk about Cancel Culture? What pattern of consciousness does this phenomenon most exalt?\n\nMaybe there really is no such thing as ‘cancel culture’; maybe we’re talking about the material incarnation of *Pride*. The great sin made manifest in the flesh – a bonafide adversary.\n\nAt the core of the idea of ‘cancelling’ (wherein a human being who is perceived by a contingent of society to have done something harmful, abusive, or immoral, becomes the target of a focused campaign of harassment in an effort to inflict psychological or physical harm on the person as a form of retribution) is fueled on almost every level by *shame*. The ‘cancellers’ are wielding shame to try and destroy the mental well-being and social reputation of a perceived target; the target will likely invoke shame towards the cancellers in an effort to protect themselves and their reputation. At the same time, both cancellers and target are (unconsciously) wielding *pride* to justify their position in the dynamic. Pride, after all, is the polarity of shame; these energies produce each other in proportion to their intensity. When we project shame onto others, we do so in part because it makes us feel like we are morally superior to the target of that shame. We play the part of canceller because it makes us feel like we are better than they are and therefore that we have something to be proud of, and we play the part of cancelled for the same reason. How many people now use the fact that they have been cancelled as a branding technique? How many people are twisted into the upside down logic of shame, entirely unaware of how their actions are in service of the extraperceptual superentity known as Pride?\n\n[Eckhart Tolle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle) addresses this phenomenon through the language of the hungry ego. In his work, ‘[A New Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Earth)’, he discusses the way in which our sense of self is habitually conflated with our identity: we forget that *we are not* our name, our history, our memories or our context, but are rather something transcending all of that which has no beginning or end because it is pure ‘awakeness’, pure consciousness. We forget this, because our egos are hungry, and the ego eats by telling itself a story about who and what it is. It was Tolle’s work that made me realize even in moments of self-pity and suicidal depression, the ego is feasting and strengthening itself. We sometimes talk about the ego as though it is only present in those who think highly of themselves, but Tolle’s point seems to be that the ego doesn’t care whether you think of yourself in a positive or negative way – it cares that you think of yourself *at all*, that you think of yourself as *being real*. Your ego can feast voraciously on the idea that you are a bad person deserving of exile, just as surely as it can feast on the notion that you are a good person capable of determining who else is deserving of exile. Egos grow fat on the unconscious and automatic narratives that emerge from drama, conflict, and argument. Egos *crave* conflict; it’s somewhere between a buffet and a day trip to the gymnasium for them. If you spend all of your time embroiled in arguments on the internet about the right politics, you are constantly reinforcing and training your ego.\n\nAnd what is the ego’s most desired delicacy?\n\nPride, and Shame. Which are one and the same.\n\nOur medium of communication – that is, *[social media](https://www.thecenterforsophiologicalstudies.com/post/persona-ideology-the-egregore-and-social-media)*, whose incentives are not spiritual or political but economic – has been designed to exploit this phenomenon for monetary gain. These platforms are fueled by advertising, and by the creation of “*engagement*”, coming from compelling “content”. They are agnostic as to the nature of the content, and are happy to encourage whatever social phenomenon is the most compulsive. As it turns out, the feeding of our egos is extraordinarily effective at this. The whole machine is built like a video game for ego competition. You have a score. You have a player character. You have feedback and gameplay loops. You have metrics for comparing your performance to everyone else who is playing. When you score a ‘hit’ you are rewarded with dings and bells and little red lights and numeric indicators of how effectively you have ‘dunked’ on the other team. Unconsciously, whether you are winning or losing, your ego is *constantly* being bombarded with affirmations. You are loved and cherished, you are unimportant, you are hated, you are respected, you are *known*. *You are real*.\n\nThere is no incentive within the system for large numbers of humans to gain a deeper understanding of how this game works, or to become self-aware about the ways in which we engage in it. On the contrary: the system works best when we are completely incurious about our modes of engagement and allow the algorithm to unscrupulously guide us towards certain topics, certain products, certain kinds of emotional reaction, etcetera. When the phenomenon of a ‘cancellation’ begins, the algorithm detects human engagement and pours gasoline onto the fire, making everyone in everyone’s network simultaneously aware of the opportunity to dive in and be a part of the game. Get it while it’s hot, get those clever dehumanizing meta-ironic comments out there now while it’s trending, because your sense of self-worth is now inextricably connected to how many likes you get on that tweet. If you hesitate, you lose points, and if you can’t get that delicious serotonin, how are you going to get out of bed in the morning? What is the point, in this nihilistic capitalist hellscape?\n\nThe proclivity for mass shaming has always been present in the human species, but its nature and cumulative effect has radically transformed along with our technological development. If you set aside your moral judgments and get curious about the intimate psychological process of ‘cancelling’ as it occurs within a single individual, you’ll see an ancient pattern that once served the vitality of the tribe. If you were a band of hunter-gatherers smaller than [Dunbar’s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number) (150 people or less) and someone in that tribe was accused of some foul transgression, getting the group together to collectively shame the culprit had a good likelihood of producing the desired effect: behavioral change, or true exile of the bad actor. This process served the long term survival of the group; it’s where our impulse to collectively shame *comes from*.\n\nBut, as with our wisdom teeth, evolution is not a perfect process. Internal combustion and circuit boards progress much faster than the biological reality of the human animal does. Our impulses and mental models are squishy and slow whereas our communication networks are now lightning quick, and when you introduce the same bundle of animals into environments with wildly different rules, you get wildly different outcomes. Collective shaming *does not work* in a globally interconnected society of diverse perspectives. We do not have a community of Dunbar’s number – we have communities of *hundreds of millions* *or billions*, all connected through the same server farms, all one IP address away. If you identify a morally deficient agent in the world and you bring your evolutionary tendency for mass shaming to bear on them, how easy it now is for that individual to put out an alarm signal and find themselves brought into and protected by a rival faction who thinks that, actually, *you* are the morally deficient one. The more we give in to that shaming impulse, the more polarized these two perspectives become; the more intense and fierce you become with your campaign to destroy or exile this other person, the more fuel you give to the parallel narrative that you are the ones deserving of punishment, and ironically, the more status you give to your target within their parallel community. The harder and louder and more intensely you attempt to cancel that person – unless they are found convincingly guilty of universally detested behavior, as in the case of someone like Harvey Weinstein – the more power you lend to that person as they splinter away from you. Nothing has changed in the animal behavior; but the technology that augments it has changed the way that equation unfolds.\n\nSo much of these fascinating and chaotic processes are the direct result of our childish relationship with our newfound technological potency. These technologies have had less than a lifetime to mature, and we’ve all had to learn how to use them from the ground up. The conflict and violence present at all levels of our society today is the natural result of handing a bunch of children the tools to wage a global psychic and spiritual war against one another. Meanwhile, the egregores that feast upon our patterns have never been stronger.\n\nPerhaps my desire to contextualize different problems in the world as these emergent eldritch beings is a fool’s errand. Maybe it really doesn’t matter how we think about these things, and maybe projecting this concept of ‘the adversary’ onto these forces won’t affect how people choose to relate to or engage with them. In my heart I find inspiration in the idea that I am waging war against dark angels who care not for the beauty and complexity of an individual human soul. It helps me remember that my enemy is not the person engaging in the destructive behavior, but the destructive behavior itself. It helps me consider how and why that pattern of consciousness is able to become so entrenched, and it helps me think about it not in terms of changing other peoples’ brains but in terms of what this monstrous being eats, and how to deprive it of that food. We evolved to create ‘the other’ – some kind of being outside of our tribe that we can rally against – as a form of protection, and in a global society where we are regularly challenged to understand the whole of humanity as our tribe, I think we may still need ‘the other’. The egregore of Pride feasts upon our shame, and we feed it constantly, unconscious to what we are doing. We default to shaming one another because we’ve inherited these ancient evolutionary patterns and have yet to realize how our indulgences do not serve us, our stated goals, or the well being of our now global tribe. We default to scorn and dismissal because we’re exhausted by the pattern of our lives and it makes dumb animals of us all. We justify our refusal to change these maladaptive processes because we hold pride and shame around them; the idea that we need to change them would require us to grapple with the very uncomfortable notion that *the world is this way because of us*. There is a massive shame looming in our unconscious, held back by the dam we’ve constructed out of pride that tells us, “No, it cannot be our responsibility, we have identified the culprit and it is *them*.”\n\nI think now of the phenomenal quote by the psychedelic shaman Terrence McKenna:\n\n> “Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather bed.”\n\nThe real antidote to shame is not Pride; it’s *courage*. Courage to confront your own inadequacies. Courage to take responsibility for the state of the world. Courage to recognize moments of conflict not as a *them* problem, but rather as your own communication deficiencies. You are missing something, you have not gained the necessary wisdom, you lack compassion or empathy and these are the real reasons you have been unable to have productive discourse. Yes, the systems select against it, yes, social media is designed to foster these communication breakdowns, yes, other people have their parts to play and you cannot be *their* absolution (nor should you allow them to force it upon you), but as a sovereign citizen of this universe, spending any amount of time or energy concerned with *other peoples’* *paths* is a waste of your power. Your path and your actions are what you have power over. There is a looming fear of worthlessness inside of you in direct proportion to how much you project that energy onto others. If you are constantly identifying the moral deficiencies in other human beings, that is the biggest, brightest red flag that somewhere within you, you fear the same deficiency in yourself. Your fear – that is, your lack of courage – may prevent you from looking at this truth in the face, but it is where these conflict patterns come from. If you ever want to heal that wound, you *have* *to have courage*.\n\nThis is the message of the Fool and the Fox, the core principle that brings [the mission of Anthromancer](https://anthromancer.com/pages/about) into focus. To be a Fool is to think of yourself as enlightened as the Fox; but to be a Fox is to recognize that you will always be a Fool, and to embrace that truth with courage and humility. There is nothing to be afraid of; we are all sinners, we are all imperfect unfolding processes within the perfect fabric of creation. Our past transgressions and the deep vitriol we’ve held for those we perceive as committing wicked deeds of their own, like all forces in nature, change over time. They are not static and eternal judgments against a person’s very soul. They are moments that we experience in the grip of truth, and then move through, as the truth itself transforms around us. This is the nature of all things, yet we treat ourselves and others as though momentary judgments become the de-facto rule of a person’s eternal totality. This is, as the buddha would say, wrong thinking, and the whole world begins to heal when we correct such wrong thinking inside our own minds.\n\nAs I revise this essay I find it interesting I should feel compelled to write it at the beginning of Pride month. Pride – the festival of liberation from shame that was created in the wake of the 1969 Stonewall Riots as lesbian, gay and transgender people from all backgrounds stood up for their right to exist as they were without shame – is really a movement of *courage*. It makes sense that people who had lived under the constant oppressive force of shame for something inherent to their identity would create a movement named after what is seen as the opposite of that oppressive force. And it’s not really my place to tell anyone how they should posture and what label they should use. But in its most divine incarnation, the lessons the rest of the world can learn from the queer community have nothing to do with “pride”, and everything to do with courage – the courage to face the imposition of shame and remain unmoved by it. The courage to accept that some people will want you to die simply for existing in your natural state, and to choose not to allow that fear to prevent you from chasing that authenticity. The courage to stand up in the face of psychological and physical acts of violence, knowing that you may suffer obliteration. It’s about courage.\n\nReactionary religious voices will look at the aesthetics – that is, the label of “pride” – and quake in their boots at what they perceive to be the most depraved distortion of deadly sin into holy virtue, and warn their children against it, and disown members of their own family, and fracture the human tribe in the wake of their own hidden shame, more concerned with keeping up appearances in their community and ‘the eyes of God’ than in deep reflection and curious investigation into the real patterns that govern all of these processes. They, too, are gripped by the tendrils of Pride. They forget themselves and they forget the lessons of their own scripture; they fall into patterns of fear and perceive them as patterns of love, seemingly unaware of what faith really means, and how bulletproof true faith in God’s love ought to make you feel. They subsume their power into ideologues and political charlatans and make the same kinds of cancel culture justifications for casting their own flesh and blood out into the world, and lack the courage to inquire into their own reasons for doing this...because the egregore of pride and shame has totally colonized the minds of *everyone* in our society.\n\nIn this sense, I find the LGBTQ community’s generational attempts to exist in public without shame to be one of the more divine manifestations of love in the world. Here is a group of people who are casting off the shame that society imposes on them in its pride. Here is a group of people who are trying, perhaps imperfectly at times, to make a world that is more kind and more accepting of different ways of being, so long as those ways of being do not harm others. Perhaps they are all prideful fools...but so are we all. It isn’t something we chose. It is something we inherited, and it is our responsibility to become aware of that pattern and to choose something different. That starts with how we choose to relate to one another. It starts with how we choose to relate to ourselves. And more than anything, it starts with courage; the courage to love ourselves and to love those who hate us, to love our imperfections and the imperfections of others, and to understand what a gift we are giving ourselves in doing so.\n\nI believe this is what Jesus of Nazareth was trying to teach the world when he died trying to absolve us of our sins; the point is that your sins do not condemn you. We are all sinners, we are not alone, and we have nothing to be afraid of. It is what it is, and you are still worthy of love. It does not matter who you are, where you’ve been, or what you’ve done, and it does not matter what other people say or think about you; the love we are talking about is the most radical love imaginable. It’s love beyond measure. It’s infinite, and eternal, and it’s always one tuning of your consciousness away; it’s always there for you, once you’ve got the tools you need to access it. It doesn’t matter what language you speak, what holy book you read, or if you even believe that God is real. The love we’re talking about doesn’t care about any of these superficial cosmic hashtags. It cares about one thing, and one thing only:\n\nCourage.\n\nHow wicked do we become when we operate from a place of fear? How twisted do our values get when we filter them through the axis of pride and shame? How useless is our creative agency when we lose sight of what we actually want, and fail to build logical frameworks for how to achieve those goals, because we’re torqued up in a maelstrom of low-vibrational animal reactivity?\n\nDo you want to build a better world? You cannot do it alone. You cannot exile and shame your way towards a more enlightened humanity. You cannot genocide the undesirables, no matter what your criteria for what ‘undesirable’ means. You have to deepen your love and lift people up, not with weakness, but with strength; not with suspicion, but with faith; not with fear, but with courage. Our hollow institutions aren’t going to suddenly become enlightened until we kill the egregores that own them. That’s a battle that starts right here, right now, in you.\n\nHow do you want to do this?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZX1Ef40WFoIx8b1KomvvW.png?height=470&width=470)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654286346, "digest": "a0CDwxWVw1rOva5isM6XOFpT3e8Eumwrn62A14QRIWk", "contributor": "0x9BBD84d92Db21D628BF78e2196677bB9F10366d3"}

{"id": "0ZketvjBBFHPKjUQS8zs_TqFQv55bahu9IOh036uLik", "title": "Web3.0是否Z世代的救贖？", "body": "## 引言\n\n當代的年輕人是很悲情的一代。讀著似乎永遠讀不完的書，考著一個接一個的試。比分數、鬥Intern，也仿佛成爲了我們從出生便刻在骨子裏的軍備競賽。出了社會，也發現蛋糕早已被分得所剩無幾，我們如行尸走肉般走在被規劃好的路綫上，沒有人關心我們所想要的是什麽。「有辦法讓我們衝出這樣的桎梏嗎？」\n\n「有，Web3.0。」\n\n## 什麽是Web3.0？\n\n提起Web3.0，或許我們首先要去認識什麽是Web3.0，説到這裏，我們就有必要對Web1.0 – Web2.0的時代做一個簡單的回顧。\n\n在Web1.0時代，大部分的用戶只能作爲内容（content）的消費者，而内容的生產者大多為職業或者是專業的内容生產者，例如AOL或者是早年的雅虎門戶就屬於這一類型的產品。這個階段的互聯網主要特徵是：可讀。\n\n到了Web2.0時代，隨著越來越多人開始關注互聯網，也讓一些靠著互聯網建立影響力的人崛起（KOL），互聯網的用戶也從只閲讀内容的消費者，漸漸地轉變成爲了既可閲讀也可生產的「生產消費者」（Prosumer），如Youtube、Instagram或Tiktok這一類型的產品就屬於Web2.0的應用。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫。\n\n到了2008年，自一位化名為中本聰的人發表了《比特幣白皮書》後，Web3.0的概念也漸漸進入了人們的視野。在這個階段，互聯網的用戶不僅可以閲讀、生產内容，甚至可以成爲内容的擁有者（Owner）。也就是說，以往的内容所有權是被平臺所掌控的，一旦平臺消失或者刪除某個用戶的内容，用戶便會因此遭受損失。而在Web3.0的時代，用戶的内容是以加密貨幣或者數字產權作爲主要的載體，是所有者的一項資產，無法被中心化平臺所剝奪。目前來看，Mirror便是這一類型的產品。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫+可有。\n\n## 爲什麽Web3.0如此迷人？\n\n### 「創作者經濟」\n\n首先，我們要理解一點，内容的所有權爲我們帶來的是對我們在網絡上每個行爲的定價。擧個例子，阿强創作了一張迷因圖（Meme），并且把它鑄造成了一個NFT，那這張迷因就是有價值的。（留意是價值，而非價格）在這個基礎下，這便有助於推動「創作者經濟」（creator economy）愈加蓬勃。\n\n[根據2021年的基準報告](https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-earnings-benchmark-report/)，目前創作者經濟的市場規模已經達到了1042億美元，而對於創作者經濟領域的投資也在2021年達到了創紀錄的13億美元，這表現出了這個領域目前蓬勃的生命力。越來越多的意見領袖「KOL」透過自己的創作、想法和影響力爲自己帶來了可觀的收入。然而，儘管許多的創作者嘔心瀝血地奉獻了自己的創意，可是他們并不能獲得相應的經濟回報。[例如擁有百萬訂閱者的Youtuber平均年廣告收入只有6萬美金，而Spotify上超過700萬播放量的音樂人中，只有0.2%的人每年版稅收入超過5萬美元](https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022)，可見創作者的大部分收入都被平臺和廣告商所蠶食，這並不是一個創作者，或是創作者的支持者所願意看到的。\n\n而在Web3.0的時代，創作者將不再是一個平臺的產品，他們可以作爲一個獨立的經濟體而存在。在Web3.0的時代，創作者們可以透過發佈NFT和社交代幣從而建立自己的粉絲社區，讓創作者可以透過除了廣告以外的方式把自己的流量變現。同時，支持者們同樣享受著隨著社區日益發展而帶來的經濟收益，形成社區蓬勃發展→創作者與支持者共同盈利→創作者獲得越來越多支持者的正向循環。同時，代幣跨越平臺與國家的屬性也為創作者提供了真正的全球市場。正如[Commsor 創始人 Mac Reddin](http://theteaguns/)所說：「創作者不需要統治世界，他們只需要一個擁有強大社區的小眾市場。創作者也有能力嘗試更多新事物，因此我們看到創作者空間中出現了有趣的社區，包括 NFT、社交資金、新平台等。」簡單來説，就是將創作者視爲一家公司，而支持者們都是他的股東。\n\n![Web3.0的相關應用（資料來源：https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Uh44JA0k6zK03ft8Gopw.avif?height=675&width=1200)\n\n從另一個角度看，Web3.0同時也讓每個創作者的輸出都可以轉換為他的經濟來源。比如一個網絡小說家可以透過賣他的小說，將其文章的初稿作為NFT販賣，讓熱愛他文章的讀者可以購買收藏。同時作者還可以從NFT的每次交易中抽取一定比例的交易稅，讓每個創作者都可以透過創作養活自己。\n\n### 「還權於民」\n\nWeb3.0更加吸引我的，在其「還權於民」的思想。\n\n在傳統的Web2.0時代，中心化的機構掌握著絕對的權力，他們掌管著我們每一個用戶的數據，這使得推特、Facebook、阿里巴巴和微博這樣的公司權力得以無限膨脹。他們可以肆意的瀏覽用戶的隱私、將數據歸爲己有以此謀利，甚至還可以透過這些數據操縱群衆的思想。這樣説起來似乎很誇張，但卻也是我們無可否認的事實。大平臺可以透過各類算法給我們喜歡看的内容，同時，他們也可以決定讓我們看到什麽。近年Facebook泄露用戶信息以及被指利用社交媒體操縱選舉的指控也將其被推上輿論的風口浪尖；特朗普多次被推特禁言一事也促使了他開辦自己的社交平臺。\n\n`「我們看似是自由的，卻只能看見那些他們想讓我們看到的，」`\n\n加密與Web3.0的精神在於自由和自主。在Web3.0的世界，每個用戶都掌控著自己的數據，讓數據的權力不再只限於機構與國家，而是歸還予每個人，而尊重個體的利益，任何的平臺不得在未經授權的情況下使用或者篡改用戶的數據，這就是Web3.0的核心精神。而我相信，人類的進程是向自由和自主發展的，而非獨裁和專制。\n\n## Z世代所面臨的問題\n\n回到主題，爲什麽要說Web3.0是Z世代的救贖？首先，我們要知我們Z世代到底在面臨著什麽。當我們從小學讀到中學，努力考上大學，再辛苦點的讀個Master、PHD，然後出到社會發現，原來這個社會的資源劃分已經早早的結束了，社會階級已經形成了固化。認命的，打份牛工，朝九晚八，然後發現到月底錢又沒了。節省點的，每個月存一點，沒有娛樂、沒有享受，一點一點地存錢買了套房子，房產證到手，半輩子沒了。不信命的，滿腔熱血地跑去創業，發現無論哪個行業競爭都大，自己卻沒經驗沒人脈，白白地葬送青春。不幸地，當我們從踏出學校門口那一瞬間，畢業就變成了失業。在中國，[今年畢業規模首超千萬](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-61632336)，16-24歲的失業率也達到了驚人的18.2%，即幾乎每五個16-24歲數的年輕人中就有一個人處於沒有工作的狀態，而即使放眼全世界，我們似乎都在面臨著同一個難題。\n\n## 爲什麽Z世代與Web3.0如此契合？\n\n然而，我們似乎與Web3.0有著完美的契合度。我們從小便在網絡世界中長大，對於新事物的理解與接受都有著很强的包容程度。而在香港，我們這一代人對於自由、良知與公義有著堅定的追求，我們追求個人權力的自主，討厭極權與專制，我們有著驚人的創意與創造力，這與Web3.0有著天然的契合。\n\n而作爲一個Z世代，我們也厭倦了朝九晚八這種機械式的生活，我們渴望能夠有著靈活的上班時間，我們也渴望能在任何地方工作；我們并不討厭工作，卻討厭被束縛，我們渴望對自己的日常行程有著絕對的自主權；我們覺得自己的靈魂是有價值的，我們有著我們所熱愛的事情，我們在乎麵包，可也希望能夠做著喜歡的事情來賺取我們的麵包；我們有壓力，卻也渴望快樂，我們希望兩者能夠平衡，而不是用著僅有的快樂來抗住如山的壓力。也正因爲如此，大多數的「我們」，[不再想成爲律師、醫生或者銀行家](https://www.antler.co/blog/the-creator-economy-boom-what-it-is-whats-driving)，而是，作爲一個創作者昂然踏足在自己的人生道路上，也正因如此，Web3.0才如此適合我們。\n\n過去的一年裏，我常常流連於許多NFT社區，發現炒NFT的許多人都是與我年齡相若的年輕人，他們很懂得社區與文化的價值，這也是很多玩Defi的old money（相對的）所不理解的。Z世代對於文化的創造和理解是很擅長的，一群志趣相投的Z世代聚在一起很快就可以形成一股Vibe，同時我們也很容易被一些有趣的Vibe所感染，像是Mfer就傳達出一種「我就爛」的Vibe就特別觸動我，而像是BAYC這種龍頭項目也讓人感到Flexing的感覺。而NFT作爲Web3.0社區與文化的催化劑，每一個NFT都能代表著社區的生命力和創造力，而Z世代們對此的嗅覺便像是與生俱來的。\n\n## Web3.0目前的困境\n\n### Web2.0與Web3.0\n\n「但Web3.0必然是我們這一代人的答案嗎？」「不是必然。」以目前來講，Web3.0還有許多的問題需要我們去探討以及解決。首先第一個問題我想引用漢陽老師在[《Web 3 批评的对与错：一次讨论》](https://masterpa.mirror.xyz/RYr8_XToc5UvC6iB6pj7zp39MRA00ZvHD05m5giddIM)這篇文章中的一段話。\n\n> Web 3 的几乎所有论点，都是伴随着对 Web 2.0 的某个批评而生的。Web 2.0 不保护隐私，Web 3 就保护；Web 2.0 不给创作者分成，Web 3 就给；Web 2.0 不能让用户共享平台收益，Web 3 就发 Token 一起投票。Web 3 不一定是一个更好的互联网，它目前是一个反对 Web 2.0 的互联网。\n\n目前的Web3.0對Web2.0存在一個内在的依附性，每每論及Web3.0似乎都無法脫離Web2.0來進行論述，支持Web3.0的論點似乎全然是建基於反對Web2.0之上的，而卻沒有一個普遍認同的觀點能讓Web3.0能夠獨立成型，説服大衆它就是「最好的互聯網」。這也是所有Web3.0的擁護者需要面對的一個問題，離開了Web2.0，Web3.0還剩下什麽？這也是我們所需要思考的。\n\n### 炒作周期\n\n2020-2021年對於加密貨幣市場來説是瘋狂的一年，在這期間，比特幣從1萬多上漲到了6萬9，各式各樣的加密貨幣概念滿天飛，gamefi、defi、元宇宙、Web3.0，塑造了無數個造富神話，正如Charlie Munger所說：「[我們正處於一個比互聯網時代更瘋狂的時代](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/12/03/berkshires-munger-says-now-even-crazier-than-dot-com-bust/?slreturn=20211106151609)」。然而，截至今日（2022/6/4），比特幣已經從高位下跌超過五成，各類Altcoin也早已跌得不成人形，大浪退去，幾乎沒有一個人穿著褲子。這時候我們才發現，原來所有的概念都是空中樓閣，經不起考驗。\n\n目前來看，Web3.0似乎還沒有爲這個世界留下實質性的應用，連Stepn這種被譽為開創性的應用似乎也無法在熊市的大環境下繼續生存，那些反對加密貨幣的群體又可以再次高呼「區塊鏈騙局」的口號，但這是否代表著Web3.0將會是再一個龐氏騙局呢？經濟學家Carlota Perez在《*[技术革命与金融资本](https://www.amazon.com/Technological-Revolutions-Financial-Capital-Dynamics/dp/1843763311)*》一書中提到了一個觀點：在過去幾百年的每一次重大工業變革，都伴隨著泡沫，而隨著這些投機泡沫的破裂，那些留下來的技術，也會逐漸發展成熟，融入我們的生活當中，從而完成技術革命，例如第一次工業革命爲我們帶來了運河和道路網絡，第二次工業革命爲我們帶來了鐵路、港口和郵政，第三次工業革命則是電力和配電網絡，石油時代爲我們提供了公路與機場，互聯網時代讓電信通訊與互聯網徹底地融入了我們的生活。\n\n值得一提的是，Carlota Perez認爲「真正的技術革命必須伴隨著大量基礎設施的發展」，因此，我們不應該把全部的目光投放在那些像是Axie、Stepn或是Sandbox這樣的應用層上，而是應該留意Ethereum、Solana這樣的公鏈，或是Arweave、Metamask這類的基礎建設的發展，這些項目才是奠定Web3.0的基礎。要知道，在互聯網泡沫破滅之前，我們并沒有Google Map、沒有Youtube、沒有Instagram、也沒有Tiktok。即使它們在當時並不存在，但卻不阻礙以幹綫技術、數據服務設施以及用戶設施所組成的互聯網推動了世界，改變了我們的生活。或許我們也不需要用我們目前的認知去預測未來Web3.0的樣子，將Web2.0的應用對標到Web3.0上，想象一個Web3.0的Instagram或者是一個Web3.0的Tiktok是沒有意義的。一個真正能夠改變世界的Web3.0應用不需要取代Web2.0的任何一個誰，它將會一款是開創性的、顛覆我們認知的產品，將每個人的生活變得更好。而我們需要做的，便是觀察、等待，伺機乘上這股時代的潮流。\n\n###

引言\n\n當代的年輕人是很悲情的一代。讀著似乎永遠讀不完的書，考著一個接一個的試。比分數、鬥Intern，也仿佛成爲了我們從出生便刻在骨子裏的軍備競賽。出了社會，也發現蛋糕早已被分得所剩無幾，我們如行尸走肉般走在被規劃好的路綫上，沒有人關心我們所想要的是什麽。「有辦法讓我們衝出這樣的桎梏嗎？」\n\n「有，Web3.0。」\n\n## 什麽是Web3.0？\n\n提起Web3.0，或許我們首先要去認識什麽是Web3.0，説到這裏，我們就有必要對Web1.0 – Web2.0的時代做一個簡單的回顧。\n\n在Web1.0時代，大部分的用戶只能作爲内容（content）的消費者，而内容的生產者大多為職業或者是專業的内容生產者，例如AOL或者是早年的雅虎門戶就屬於這一類型的產品。這個階段的互聯網主要特徵是：可讀。\n\n到了Web2.0時代，隨著越來越多人開始關注互聯網，也讓一些靠著互聯網建立影響力的人崛起（KOL），互聯網的用戶也從只閲讀内容的消費者，漸漸地轉變成爲了既可閲讀也可生產的「生產消費者」（Prosumer），如Youtube、Instagram或Tiktok這一類型的產品就屬於Web2.0的應用。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫。\n\n到了2008年，自一位化名為中本聰的人發表了《比特幣白皮書》後，Web3.0的概念也漸漸進入了人們的視野。在這個階段，互聯網的用戶不僅可以閲讀、生產内容，甚至可以成爲内容的擁有者（Owner）。也就是說，以往的内容所有權是被平臺所掌控的，一旦平臺消失或者刪除某個用戶的内容，用戶便會因此遭受損失。而在Web3.0的時代，用戶的内容是以加密貨幣或者數字產權作爲主要的載體，是所有者的一項資產，無法被中心化平臺所剝奪。目前來看，Mirror便是這一類型的產品。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫+可有。\n\n## 爲什麽Web3.0如此迷人？\n\n### 「創作者經濟」\n\n首先，我們要理解一點，内容的所有權爲我們帶來的是對我們在網絡上每個行爲的定價。擧個例子，阿强創作了一張迷因圖（Meme），并且把它鑄造成了一個NFT，那這張迷因就是有價值的。（留意是價值，而非價格）在這個基礎下，這便有助於推動「創作者經濟」（creator economy）愈加蓬勃。\n\n[根據2021年的基準報告](https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-earnings-benchmark-report/)，目前創作者經濟的市場規模已經達到了1042億美元，而對於創作者經濟領域的投資也在2021年達到了創紀錄的13億美元，這表現出了這個領域目前蓬勃的生命力。越來越多的意見領袖「KOL」透過自己的創作、想法和影響力爲自己帶來了可觀的收入。然而，儘管許多的創作者嘔心瀝血地奉獻了自己的創意，可是他們并不能獲得相應的經濟回報。[例如擁有百萬訂閱者的Youtuber平均年廣告收入只有6萬美金，而Spotify上超過700萬播放量的音樂人中，只有0.2%的人每年版稅收入超過5萬美元](https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022)，可見創作者的大部分收入都被平臺和廣告商所蠶食，這並不是一個創作者，或是創作者的支持者所願意看到的。\n\n而在Web3.0的時代，創作者將不再是一個平臺的產品，他們可以作爲一個獨立的經濟體而存在。在Web3.0的時代，創作者們可以透過發佈NFT和社交代幣從而建立自己的粉絲社區，讓創作者可以透過除了廣告以外的方式把自己的流量變現。同時，支持者們同樣享受著隨著社區日益發展而帶來的經濟收益，形成社區蓬勃發展→創作者與支持者共同盈利→創作者獲得越來越多支持者的正向循環。同時，代幣跨越平臺與國家的屬性也為創作者提供了真正的全球市場。正如[Commsor 創始人 Mac Reddin](http://theteaguns/)所說：「創作者不需要統治世界，他們只需要一個擁有強大社區的小眾市場。創作者也有能力嘗試更多新事物，因此我們看到創作者空間中出現了有趣的社區，包括 NFT、社交資金、新平台等。」簡單來説，就是將創作者視爲一家公司，而支持者們都是他的股東。\n\n![Web3.0的相關應用（資料來源：https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Uh44JA0k6zK03ft8Gopw.avif?height=675&width=1200)\n\n從另一個角度看，Web3.0同時也讓每個創作者的輸出都可以轉換為他的經濟來源。比如一個網絡小說家可以透過賣他的小說，將其文章的初稿作為NFT販賣，讓熱愛他文章的讀者可以購買收藏。同時作者還可以從NFT的每次交易中抽取一定比例的交易稅，讓每個創作者都可以透過創作養活自己。\n\n### 「還權於民」\n\nWeb3.0更加吸引我的，在其「還權於民」的思想。\n\n在傳統的Web2.0時代，中心化的機構掌握著絕對的權力，他們掌管著我們每一個用戶的數據，這使得推特、Facebook、阿里巴巴和微博這樣的公司權力得以無限膨脹。他們可以肆意的瀏覽用戶的隱私、將數據歸爲己有以此謀利，甚至還可以透過這些數據操縱群衆的思想。這樣説起來似乎很誇張，但卻也是我們無可否認的事實。大平臺可以透過各類算法給我們喜歡看的内容，同時，他們也可以決定讓我們看到什麽。近年Facebook泄露用戶信息以及被指利用社交媒體操縱選舉的指控也將其被推上輿論的風口浪尖；特朗普多次被推特禁言一事也促使了他開辦自己的社交平臺。\n\n`「我們看似是自由的，卻只能看見那些他們想讓我們看到的，」`\n\n加密與Web3.0的精神在於自由和自主。在Web3.0的世界，每個用戶都掌控著自己的數據，讓數據的權力不再只限於機構與國家，而是歸還予每個人，而尊重個體的利益，任何的平臺不得在未經授權的情況下使用或者篡改用戶的數據，這就是Web3.0的核心精神。而我相信，人類的進程是向自由和自主發展的，而非獨裁和專制。\n\n## Z世代所面臨的問題\n\n回到主題，爲什麽要說Web3.0是Z世代的救贖？首先，我們要知我們Z世代到底在面臨著什麽。當我們從小學讀到中學，努力考上大學，再辛苦點的讀個Master、PHD，然後出到社會發現，原來這個社會的資源劃分已經早早的結束了，社會階級已經形成了固化。認命的，打份牛工，朝九晚八，然後發現到月底錢又沒了。節省點的，每個月存一點，沒有娛樂、沒有享受，一點一點地存錢買了套房子，房產證到手，半輩子沒了。不信命的，滿腔熱血地跑去創業，發現無論哪個行業競爭都大，自己卻沒經驗沒人脈，白白地葬送青春。不幸地，當我們從踏出學校門口那一瞬間，畢業就變成了失業。在中國，[今年畢業規模首超千萬](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-61632336)，16-24歲的失業率也達到了驚人的18.2%，即幾乎每五個16-24歲數的年輕人中就有一個人處於沒有工作的狀態，而即使放眼全世界，我們似乎都在面臨著同一個難題。\n\n## 爲什麽Z世代與Web3.0如此契合？\n\n然而，我們似乎與Web3.0有著完美的契合度。我們從小便在網絡世界中長大，對於新事物的理解與接受都有著很强的包容程度。而在香港，我們這一代人對於自由、良知與公義有著堅定的追求，我們追求個人權力的自主，討厭極權與專制，我們有著驚人的創意與創造力，這與Web3.0有著天然的契合。\n\n而作爲一個Z世代，我們也厭倦了朝九晚八這種機械式的生活，我們渴望能夠有著靈活的上班時間，我們也渴望能在任何地方工作；我們并不討厭工作，卻討厭被束縛，我們渴望對自己的日常行程有著絕對的自主權；我們覺得自己的靈魂是有價值的，我們有著我們所熱愛的事情，我們在乎麵包，可也希望能夠做著喜歡的事情來賺取我們的麵包；我們有壓力，卻也渴望快樂，我們希望兩者能夠平衡，而不是用著僅有的快樂來抗住如山的壓力。也正因爲如此，大多數的「我們」，[不再想成爲律師、醫生或者銀行家](https://www.antler.co/blog/the-creator-economy-boom-what-it-is-whats-driving)，而是，作爲一個創作者昂然踏足在自己的人生道路上，也正因如此，Web3.0才如此適合我們。\n\n過去的一年裏，我常常流連於許多NFT社區，發現炒NFT的許多人都是與我年齡相若的年輕人，他們很懂得社區與文化的價值，這也是很多玩Defi的old

而作爲一個Z世代，我們也厭倦了朝九晚八這種機械式的生活，我們渴望能夠有著靈活的上班時間，我們也渴望能在任何地方工作；我們并不討厭工作，卻討厭被束縛，我們渴望對自己的日常行程有著絕對的自主權；我們覺得自己的靈魂是有價值的，我們有著我們所熱愛的事情，我們在乎麵包，可也希望能夠做著喜歡的事情來賺取我們的麵包；我們有壓力，卻也渴望快樂，我們希望兩者能夠平衡，而不是用著僅有的快樂來抗住如山的壓力。也正因爲如此，大多數的「我們」，[不再想成爲律師、醫生或者銀行家](https://www.antler.co/blog/the-creator-economy-boom-what-it-is-whats-driving)，而是，作爲一個創作者昂然踏足在自己的人生道路上，也正因如此，Web3.0才如此適合我們。\n\n        過去的一年裏，我常常流連於許多NFT社區，發現炒NFT的許多人都是與我年齡相若的年輕人，他們很懂得社區與文化的價值，這也是很多玩Defi的old money（相對的）所不理解的。Z世代對於文化的創造和理解是很擅長的，一群志趣相投的Z世代聚在一起很快就可以形成一股Vibe，同時我們也很容易被一些有趣的Vibe所感染，像是Mfer就傳達出一種「我就爛」的Vibe就特別觸動我，而像是BAYC這種龍頭項目也讓人感到Flexing的感覺。而NFT作爲Web3.0社區與文化的催化劑，每一個NFT都能代表著社區的生命力和創造力，而Z世代們對此的嗅覺便像是與生俱來的。\n\n## Web3.0目前的困境\n\n### Web2.0與Web3.0\n\n        「但Web3.0必然是我們這一代人的答案嗎？」「不是必然。」以目前來講，Web3.0還有許多的問題需要我們去探討以及解決。首先第一個問題我想引用漢陽老師在[《Web 3 批评的对与错：一次讨论》](https://masterpa.mirror.xyz/RYr8_XToc5UvC6iB6pj7zp39MRA00ZvHD05m5giddIM)這篇文章中的一段話。\n\n>         Web 3 的几乎所有论点，都是伴随着对 Web 2.0 的某个批评而生的。Web 2.0 不保护隐私，Web 3 就保护；Web 2.0 不给创作者分成，Web 3 就给；Web 2.0 不能让用户共享平台收益，Web 3 就发 Token 一起投票。Web 3 不一定是一个更好的互联网，它目前是一个反对 Web 2.0 的互联网。\n\n        目前的Web3.0對Web2.0存在一個内在的依附性，每每論及Web3.0似乎都無法脫離Web2.0來進行論述，支持Web3.0的論點似乎全然是建基於反對Web2.0之上的，而卻沒有一個普遍認同的觀點能讓Web3.0能夠獨立成型，説服大衆它就是「最好的互聯網」。這也是所有Web3.0的擁護者需要面對的一個問題，離開了Web2.0，Web3.0還剩下什麽？這也是我們所需要思考的。\n\n### 炒作周期\n\n        2020-2021年對於加密貨幣市場來説是瘋狂的一年，在這期間，比特幣從1萬多上漲到了6萬9，各式各樣的加密貨幣概念滿天飛，gamefi、defi、元宇宙、Web3.0，塑造了無數個造富神話，正如Charlie Munger所說：「[我們正處於一個比互聯網時代更瘋狂的時代](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/12/03/berkshires-munger-says-now-even-crazier-than-dot-com-bust/?slreturn=20211106151609)」。然而，截至今日（2022/6/4），比特幣已經從高位下跌超過五成，各類Altcoin也早已跌得不成人形，大浪退去，幾乎沒有一個人穿著褲子。這時候我們才發現，原來所有的概念都是空中樓閣，經不起考驗。\n\n        目前來看，Web3.0似乎還沒有爲這個世界留下實質性的應用，連Stepn這種被譽為開創性的應用似乎也無法在熊市的大環境下繼續生存，那些反對加密貨幣的群體又可以再次高呼「區塊鏈騙局」的口號，但這是否代表著Web3.0將會是再一個龐氏騙局呢？經濟學家Carlota Perez在《*[技术革命与金融资本](https://www.amazon.com/Technological-Revolutions-Financial-Capital-Dynamics/dp/1843763311)*》一書中提到了一個觀點：在過去幾百年的每一次重大工業變革，都伴隨著泡沫，而隨著這些投機泡沫的破裂，那些留下來的技術，也會逐漸發展成熟，融入我們的生活當中，從而完成技術革命，例如第一次工業革命爲我們帶來了運河和道路網絡，第二次工業革命爲我們帶來了鐵路、港口和郵政，第三次工業革命則是電力和配電網絡，石油時代爲我們提供了公路與機場，互聯網時代讓電信通訊與互聯網徹底地融入了我們的生活。\n\n        值得一提的是，Carlota Perez認爲「真正的技術革命必須伴隨著大量基礎設施的發展」，因此，我們不應該把全部的目光投放在那些像是Axie、Stepn或是Sandbox這樣的應用層上，而是應該留意Ethereum、Solana這樣的公鏈，或是Arweave、Metamask這類的基礎建設的發展，這些項目才是奠定Web3.0的基礎。要知道，在互聯網泡沫破滅之前，我們并沒有Google Map、沒有Youtube、沒有Instagram、也沒有Tiktok。即使它們在當時並不存在，但卻不阻礙以幹綫技術、數據服務設施以及用戶設施所組成的互聯網推動了世界，改變了我們的生活。或許我們也不需要用我們目前的認知去預測未來Web3.0的樣子，將Web2.0的應用對標到Web3.0上，想象一個Web3.0的Instagram或者是一個Web3.0的Tiktok是沒有意義的。一個真正能夠改變世界的Web3.0應用不需要取代Web2.0的任何一個誰，它將會一款是開創性的、顛覆我們認知的產品，將每個人的生活變得更好。而我們需要做的，便是觀察、等待，伺機乘上這股時代的潮流。\n\n###

當代的年輕人是很悲情的一代。讀著似乎永遠讀不完的書，考著一個接一個的試。比分數、鬥Intern，也仿佛成爲了我們從出生便刻在骨子裏的軍備競賽。出了社會，也發現蛋糕早已被分得所剩無幾，我們如行尸走肉般走在被規劃好的路綫上，沒有人關心我們所想要的是什麽。「有辦法讓我們衝出這樣的桎梏嗎？」\n\n \n\n        「有，Web3.0。」\n\n## 什麽是Web3.0？\n\n        提起Web3.0，或許我們首先要去認識什麽是Web3.0，説到這裏，我們就有必要對Web1.0 – Web2.0的時代做一個簡單的回顧。\n\n        在Web1.0時代，大部分的用戶只能作爲内容（content）的消費者，而内容的生產者大多為職業或者是專業的内容生產者，例如AOL或者是早年的雅虎門戶就屬於這一類型的產品。這個階段的互聯網主要特徵是：可讀。\n\n        到了Web2.0時代，隨著越來越多人開始關注互聯網，也讓一些靠著互聯網建立影響力的人崛起（KOL），互聯網的用戶也從只閲讀内容的消費者，漸漸地轉變成爲了既可閲讀也可生產的「生產消費者」（Prosumer），如Youtube、Instagram或Tiktok這一類型的產品就屬於Web2.0的應用。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫。 \n\n        到了2008年，自一位化名為中本聰的人發表了《比特幣白皮書》後，Web3.0的概念也漸漸進入了人們的視野。在這個階段，互聯網的用戶不僅可以閲讀、生產内容，甚至可以成爲内容的擁有者（Owner）。也就是說，以往的内容所有權是被平臺所掌控的，一旦平臺消失或者刪除某個用戶的内容，用戶便會因此遭受損失。而在Web3.0的時代，用戶的内容是以加密貨幣或者數字產權作爲主要的載體，是所有者的一項資產，無法被中心化平臺所剝奪。目前來看，Mirror便是這一類型的產品。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫+可有。\n\n## 爲什麽Web3.0如此迷人？\n\n### 「創作者經濟」\n\n        首先，我們要理解一點，内容的所有權爲我們帶來的是對我們在網絡上每個行爲的定價。擧個例子，阿强創作了一張迷因圖（Meme），并且把它鑄造成了一個NFT，那這張迷因就是有價值的。（留意是價值，而非價格）在這個基礎下，這便有助於推動「創作者經濟」（creator economy）愈加蓬勃。\n\n        [根據2021年的基準報告](https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-earnings-benchmark-report/)，目前創作者經濟的市場規模已經達到了1042億美元，而對於創作者經濟領域的投資也在2021年達到了創紀錄的13億美元，這表現出了這個領域目前蓬勃的生命力。越來越多的意見領袖「KOL」透過自己的創作、想法和影響力爲自己帶來了可觀的收入。然而，儘管許多的創作者嘔心瀝血地奉獻了自己的創意，可是他們并不能獲得相應的經濟回報。[例如擁有百萬訂閱者的Youtuber平均年廣告收入只有6萬美金，而Spotify上超過700萬播放量的音樂人中，只有0.2%的人每年版稅收入超過5萬美元](https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022)，可見創作者的大部分收入都被平臺和廣告商所蠶食，這並不是一個創作者，或是創作者的支持者所願意看到的。\n\n        而在Web3.0的時代，創作者將不再是一個平臺的產品，他們可以作爲一個獨立的經濟體而存在。在Web3.0的時代，創作者們可以透過發佈NFT和社交代幣從而建立自己的粉絲社區，讓創作者可以透過除了廣告以外的方式把自己的流量變現。同時，支持者們同樣享受著隨著社區日益發展而帶來的經濟收益，形成社區蓬勃發展→創作者與支持者共同盈利→創作者獲得越來越多支持者的正向循環。同時，代幣跨越平臺與國家的屬性也為創作者提供了真正的全球市場。正如[Commsor 創始人 Mac Reddin](http://theteaguns/)所說：「創作者不需要統治世界，他們只需要一個擁有強大社區的小眾市場。創作者也有能力嘗試更多新事物，因此我們看到創作者空間中出現了有趣的社區，包括 NFT、社交資金、新平台等。」簡單來説，就是將創作者視爲一家公司，而支持者們都是他的股東。\n\n![Web3.0的相關應用（資料來源：https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jNaGFpk-hOqSw1urQT92X.avif?height=675&width=1200&size=medium)\n\n        從另一個角度看，Web3.0同時也讓每個創作者的輸出都可以轉換為他的經濟來源。比如一個網絡小說家可以透過賣他的小說，將其文章的初稿作為NFT販賣，讓熱愛他文章的讀者可以購買收藏。同時作者還可以從NFT的每次交易中抽取一定比例的交易稅，讓每個創作者都可以透過創作養活自己。\n\n### 「還權於民」\n\n        Web3.0更加吸引我的，在其「還權於民」的思想。\n\n        在傳統的Web2.0時代，中心化的機構掌握著絕對的權力，他們掌管著我們每一個用戶的數據，這使得推特、Facebook、阿里巴巴和微博這樣的公司權力得以無限膨脹。他們可以肆意的瀏覽用戶的隱私、將數據歸爲己有以此謀利，甚至還可以透過這些數據操縱群衆的思想。這樣説起來似乎很誇張，但卻也是我們無可否認的事實。大平臺可以透過各類算法給我們喜歡看的内容，同時，他們也可以決定讓我們看到什麽。近年Facebook泄露用戶信息以及被指利用社交媒體操縱選舉的指控也將其被推上輿論的風口浪尖；特朗普多次被推特禁言一事也促使了他開辦自己的社交平臺。\n\n        `「我們看似是自由的，卻只能看見那些他們想讓我們看到的，」`\n\n        加密與Web3.0的精神在於自由和自主。在Web3.0的世界，每個用戶都掌控著自己的數據，讓數據的權力不再只限於機構與國家，而是歸還予每個人，而尊重個體的利益，任何的平臺不得在未經授權的情況下使用或者篡改用戶的數據，這就是Web3.0的核心精神。而我相信，人類的進程是向自由和自主發展的，而非獨裁和專制。\n\n## Z世代所面臨的問題\n\n        回到主題，爲什麽要說Web3.0是Z世代的救贖？首先，我們要知我們Z世代到底在面臨著什麽。當我們從小學讀到中學，努力考上大學，再辛苦點的讀個Master、PHD，然後出到社會發現，原來這個社會的資源劃分已經早早的結束了，社會階級已經形成了固化。認命的，打份牛工，朝九晚八，然後發現到月底錢又沒了。節省點的，每個月存一點，沒有娛樂、沒有享受，一點一點地存錢買了套房子，房產證到手，半輩子沒了。不信命的，滿腔熱血地跑去創業，發現無論哪個行業競爭都大，自己卻沒經驗沒人脈，白白地葬送青春。不幸地，當我們從踏出學校門口那一瞬間，畢業就變成了失業。在中國，[今年畢業規模首超千萬](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-61632336)，16-24歲的失業率也達到了驚人的18.2%，即幾乎每五個16-24歲數的年輕人中就有一個人處於沒有工作的狀態，而即使放眼全世界，我們似乎都在面臨著同一個難題。\n\n##

Z世代所面臨的問題\n\n回到主題，爲什麽要說Web3.0是Z世代的救贖？首先，我們要知我們Z世代到底在面臨著什麽。當我們從小學讀到中學，努力考上大學，再辛苦點的讀個Master、PHD，然後出到社會發現，原來這個社會的資源劃分已經早早的結束了，社會階級已經形成了固化。認命的，打份牛工，朝九晚八，然後發現到月底錢又沒了。節省點的，每個月存一點，沒有娛樂、沒有享受，一點一點地存錢買了套房子，房產證到手，半輩子沒了。不信命的，滿腔熱血地跑去創業，發現無論哪個行業競爭都大，自己卻沒經驗沒人脈，白白地葬送青春。不幸地，當我們從踏出學校門口那一瞬間，畢業就變成了失業。在中國，[今年畢業規模首超千萬](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-61632336)，16-24歲的失業率也達到了驚人的18.2%，即幾乎每五個16-24歲數的年輕人中就有一個人處於沒有工作的狀態，而即使放眼全世界，我們似乎都在面臨著同一個難題。\n\n## 爲什麽Z世代與Web3.0如此契合？\n\n然而，我們似乎與Web3.0有著完美的契合度。我們從小便在網絡世界中長大，對於新事物的理解與接受都有著很强的包容程度。而在香港，我們這一代人對於自由、良知與公義有著堅定的追求，我們追求個人權力的自主，討厭極權與專制，我們有著驚人的創意與創造力，這與Web3.0有著天然的契合。\n\n而作爲一個Z世代，我們也厭倦了朝九晚八這種機械式的生活，我們渴望能夠有著靈活的上班時間，我們也渴望能在任何地方工作；我們并不討厭工作，卻討厭被束縛，我們渴望對自己的日常行程有著絕對的自主權；我們覺得自己的靈魂是有價值的，我們有著我們所熱愛的事情，我們在乎麵包，可也希望能夠做著喜歡的事情來賺取我們的麵包；我們有壓力，卻也渴望快樂，我們希望兩者能夠平衡，而不是用著僅有的快樂來抗住如山的壓力。也正因爲如此，大多數的「我們」，[不再想成爲律師、醫生或者銀行家](https://www.antler.co/blog/the-creator-economy-boom-what-it-is-whats-driving)，而是，作爲一個創作者昂然踏足在自己的人生道路上，也正因如此，Web3.0才如此適合我們。\n\n過去的一年裏，我常常流連於許多NFT社區，發現炒NFT的許多人都是與我年齡相若的年輕人，他們很懂得社區與文化的價值，這也是很多玩Defi的old money（相對的）所不理解的。Z世代對於文化的創造和理解是很擅長的，一群志趣相投的Z世代聚在一起很快就可以形成一股Vibe，同時我們也很容易被一些有趣的Vibe所感染，像是Mfer就傳達出一種「我就爛」的Vibe就特別觸動我，而像是BAYC這種龍頭項目也讓人感到Flexing的感覺。而NFT作爲Web3.0社區與文化的催化劑，每一個NFT都能代表著社區的生命力和創造力，而Z世代們對此的嗅覺便像是與生俱來的。\n\n## Web3.0目前的困境\n\n### Web2.0與Web3.0\n\n「但Web3.0必然是我們這一代人的答案嗎？」「不是必然。」以目前來講，Web3.0還有許多的問題需要我們去探討以及解決。首先第一個問題我想引用漢陽老師在[《Web 3 批评的对与错：一次讨论》](https://masterpa.mirror.xyz/RYr8_XToc5UvC6iB6pj7zp39MRA00ZvHD05m5giddIM)這篇文章中的一段話。\n\n> Web 3 的几乎所有论点，都是伴随着对 Web 2.0 的某个批评而生的。Web 2.0 不保护隐私，Web 3 就保护；Web 2.0 不给创作者分成，Web 3 就给；Web 2.0 不能让用户共享平台收益，Web 3 就发 Token 一起投票。Web 3 不一定是一个更好的互联网，它目前是一个反对 Web 2.0 的互联网。\n\n目前的Web3.0對Web2.0存在一個内在的依附性，每每論及Web3.0似乎都無法脫離Web2.0來進行論述，支持Web3.0的論點似乎全然是建基於反對Web2.0之上的，而卻沒有一個普遍認同的觀點能讓Web3.0能夠獨立成型，説服大衆它就是「最好的互聯網」。這也是所有Web3.0的擁護者需要面對的一個問題，離開了Web2.0，Web3.0還剩下什麽？這也是我們所需要思考的。\n\n### 炒作周期\n\n2020-2021年對於加密貨幣市場來説是瘋狂的一年，在這期間，比特幣從1萬多上漲到了6萬9，各式各樣的加密貨幣概念滿天飛，gamefi、defi、元宇宙、Web3.0，塑造了無數個造富神話，正如Charlie Munger所說：「[我們正處於一個比互聯網時代更瘋狂的時代](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/12/03/berkshires-munger-says-now-even-crazier-than-dot-com-bust/?slreturn=20211106151609)」。然而，截至今日（2022/6/4），比特幣已經從高位下跌超過五成，各類Altcoin也早已跌得不成人形，大浪退去，幾乎沒有一個人穿著褲子。這時候我們才發現，原來所有的概念都是空中樓閣，經不起考驗。\n\n目前來看，Web3.0似乎還沒有爲這個世界留下實質性的應用，連Stepn這種被譽為開創性的應用似乎也無法在熊市的大環境下繼續生存，那些反對加密貨幣的群體又可以再次高呼「區塊鏈騙局」的口號，但這是否代表著Web3.0將會是再一個龐氏騙局呢？經濟學家Carlota Perez在《*[技术革命与金融资本](https://www.amazon.com/Technological-Revolutions-Financial-Capital-Dynamics/dp/1843763311)*》一書中提到了一個觀點：在過去幾百年的每一次重大工業變革，都伴隨著泡沫，而隨著這些投機泡沫的破裂，那些留下來的技術，也會逐漸發展成熟，融入我們的生活當中，從而完成技術革命，例如第一次工業革命爲我們帶來了運河和道路網絡，第二次工業革命爲我們帶來了鐵路、港口和郵政，第三次工業革命則是電力和配電網絡，石油時代爲我們提供了公路與機場，互聯網時代讓電信通訊與互聯網徹底地融入了我們的生活。\n\n值得一提的是，Carlota Perez認爲「真正的技術革命必須伴隨著大量基礎設施的發展」，因此，我們不應該把全部的目光投放在那些像是Axie、Stepn或是Sandbox這樣的應用層上，而是應該留意Ethereum、Solana這樣的公鏈，或是Arweave、Metamask這類的基礎建設的發展，這些項目才是奠定Web3.0的基礎。要知道，在互聯網泡沫破滅之前，我們并沒有Google Map、沒有Youtube、沒有Instagram、也沒有Tiktok。即使它們在當時並不存在，但卻不阻礙以幹綫技術、數據服務設施以及用戶設施所組成的互聯網推動了世界，改變了我們的生活。或許我們也不需要用我們目前的認知去預測未來Web3.0的樣子，將Web2.0的應用對標到Web3.0上，想象一個Web3.0的Instagram或者是一個Web3.0的Tiktok是沒有意義的。一個真正能夠改變世界的Web3.0應用不需要取代Web2.0的任何一個誰，它將會一款是開創性的、顛覆我們認知的產品，將每個人的生活變得更好。而我們需要做的，便是觀察、等待，伺機乘上這股時代的潮流。\n\n###

{"id": "qmp6Vtip15adEVo6Mb7HMyUwcZB751R5I-3p5ObOJS0", "title": "Web3.0是否Z世代的救贖？", "body": "## 引言\n\n當代的年輕人是很悲情的一代。讀著似乎永遠讀不完的書，考著一個接一個的試。比分數、鬥Intern，也仿佛成爲了我們從出生便刻在骨子裏的軍備競賽。出了社會，也發現蛋糕早已被分得所剩無幾，我們如行尸走肉般走在被規劃好的路綫上，沒有人關心我們所想要的是什麽。「有辦法讓我們衝出這樣的桎梏嗎？」\n\n「有，Web3.0。」\n\n## 什麽是Web3.0？\n\n提起Web3.0，或許我們首先要去認識什麽是Web3.0，説到這裏，我們就有必要對Web1.0 – Web2.0的時代做一個簡單的回顧。\n\n在Web1.0時代，大部分的用戶只能作爲内容（content）的消費者，而内容的生產者大多為職業或者是專業的内容生產者，例如AOL或者是早年的雅虎門戶就屬於這一類型的產品。這個階段的互聯網主要特徵是：可讀。\n\n到了Web2.0時代，隨著越來越多人開始關注互聯網，也讓一些靠著互聯網建立影響力的人崛起（KOL），互聯網的用戶也從只閲讀内容的消費者，漸漸地轉變成爲了既可閲讀也可生產的「生產消費者」（Prosumer），如Youtube、Instagram或Tiktok這一類型的產品就屬於Web2.0的應用。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫。\n\n到了2008年，自一位化名為中本聰的人發表了《比特幣白皮書》後，Web3.0的概念也漸漸進入了人們的視野。在這個階段，互聯網的用戶不僅可以閲讀、生產内容，甚至可以成爲内容的擁有者（Owner）。也就是說，以往的内容所有權是被平臺所掌控的，一旦平臺消失或者刪除某個用戶的内容，用戶便會因此遭受損失。而在Web3.0的時代，用戶的内容是以加密貨幣或者數字產權作爲主要的載體，是所有者的一項資產，無法被中心化平臺所剝奪。目前來看，Mirror便是這一類型的產品。在這個階段互聯網的特徵是：可讀+可寫+可有。\n\n## 爲什麽Web3.0如此迷人？\n\n### 「創作者經濟」\n\n首先，我們要理解一點，内容的所有權爲我們帶來的是對我們在網絡上每個行爲的定價。擧個例子，阿强創作了一張迷因圖（Meme），并且把它鑄造成了一個NFT，那這張迷因就是有價值的。（留意是價值，而非價格）在這個基礎下，這便有助於推動「創作者經濟」（creator economy）愈加蓬勃。\n\n[根據2021年的基準報告](https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-earnings-benchmark-report/)，目前創作者經濟的市場規模已經達到了1042億美元，而對於創作者經濟領域的投資也在2021年達到了創紀錄的13億美元，這表現出了這個領域目前蓬勃的生命力。越來越多的意見領袖「KOL」透過自己的創作、想法和影響力爲自己帶來了可觀的收入。然而，儘管許多的創作者嘔心瀝血地奉獻了自己的創意，可是他們并不能獲得相應的經濟回報。[例如擁有百萬訂閱者的Youtuber平均年廣告收入只有6萬美金，而Spotify上超過700萬播放量的音樂人中，只有0.2%的人每年版稅收入超過5萬美元](https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022)，可見創作者的大部分收入都被平臺和廣告商所蠶食，這並不是一個創作者，或是創作者的支持者所願意看到的。\n\n而在Web3.0的時代，創作者將不再是一個平臺的產品，他們可以作爲一個獨立的經濟體而存在。在Web3.0的時代，創作者們可以透過發佈NFT和社交代幣從而建立自己的粉絲社區，讓創作者可以透過除了廣告以外的方式把自己的流量變現。同時，支持者們同樣享受著隨著社區日益發展而帶來的經濟收益，形成社區蓬勃發展→創作者與支持者共同盈利→創作者獲得越來越多支持者的正向循環。同時，代幣跨越平臺與國家的屬性也為創作者提供了真正的全球市場。正如[Commsor 創始人 Mac Reddin](http://theteaguns/)所說：「創作者不需要統治世界，他們只需要一個擁有強大社區的小眾市場。創作者也有能力嘗試更多新事物，因此我們看到創作者空間中出現了有趣的社區，包括 NFT、社交資金、新平台等。」簡單來説，就是將創作者視爲一家公司，而支持者們都是他的股東。\n\n![Web3.0的相關應用（資料來源：https://www.antler.co/blog/creatoreconomy2022）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Uh44JA0k6zK03ft8Gopw.avif?height=675&width=1200&size=large)\n\n從另一個角度看，Web3.0同時也讓每個創作者的輸出都可以轉換為他的經濟來源。比如一個網絡小說家可以透過賣他的小說，將其文章的初稿作為NFT販賣，讓熱愛他文章的讀者可以購買收藏。同時作者還可以從NFT的每次交易中抽取一定比例的交易稅，讓每個創作者都可以透過創作養活自己。\n\n###

I want to build.” \n  \n These words echo what we have heard in many interviews over the last several months. And they resemble the experience of many of us in helping to found and foster open source projects back in our web2 days. Despite the ever-growing number of projects that help in DAO formation and management and the success of projects like GitCoin and SeedCamp, builders are not yet founding web3 projects at anything close to the pace we all would like to see.  \n\nHere are a few statistics about the relative scale of web3 - so far:\n\n* 2021 was a year of crypto and web3 hype - and yet according to data from Crunchbase, only 5% of venture deals were in the web3 space.  \n* Deep Dao as of May 2022, only lists 91 DAOs with over $1 million assets under management - and approximately 50% of the total AUM is concentrated in only three DAOs.  \n* As pointed out by A16Z in their recent state of crypto report, the AUM of all of DeFi would rank as the 31st largest bank in the United States.\n* On average there were just over 15,000 businesses receiving an employer ID number just in the United States each day. These are employers that are likely to actually employ someone as opposed to S corps which are individual companies - there are many more of these.  By comparison there are only 4,834 projects listed on DeepDao.  \n\nThere are 3x more “normie companies” founded in the US in a day than there are DAOs in existence.  \n\nWe have a long, long way to go for web3 to become the favored home of founders and especially of those that are technology-focused.  \n Here are some of the DAO founder pain points that we are building to solve:\n\n* Diversification: \n  * “My DAO contributors - and investors - have their fingers in many pies.  I’m all-in over here at this DAO.  What happens to me and my co-founders if it only does ok?” \n  * “We wanted to diversify our treasury but a) liquidity remains low so sales crush the price and b) the token holders are short-term focused, they want ‘token go up….So they shoot down our proposals and push us to hype more and HUDL HUDL HUDL.”\n* Loneliness:\n  * We all have imposter syndrome.  And we all have experienced, some of us more than others, gaslighting by investors and others who would profit if only you saw the world their way and acquiesced to their strategies. While web3 vibes are generally positive and welcoming, founders told us that there are few safe places to talk about DAO growth and challenges with others that are at a similar stage in their founding journey.  \n* Power law and the very few chances founders have to win:\n  * Those of us that think in terms of economics and finance are all too aware of the power-law nature of returns in traditional venture capital.  It turns out that all of the returns to venture capital investors are contributed by the top several percent of companies. Returns to founders are even more skewed, meaning the vast majority of founders would have been better off if they had taken a reasonably well-paying job. \n  * If each start-up takes 4-5 years for a committed founder, they may only have 4-5 potential start-ups in their life.

Dentre as principais estão:\n  * **Deposit APY:** incentivos pagos aos que depositarem seus FOX na *pool.* Esse APY representa somente uma parte das recompensas, não considerando os incentivos adicionais distribuidos aos *stakers.*\n  * **Stable Borrowing:** custo para emprestar FOX com taxa pré-fixada\n  * **Variable Borrowing:** custo para emprestar FOX a taxas variáveis conforme a demanda do token.\n  * **Maximum LTV:** porcentagem máxima que você poderá emprestar de FOX com seu depósito na Agave.\n  * **Liquidity Threshold:** porcentagem que poderá causar sua liquidação na Agave\n  * **Liquidity Penalty:** penalidade cobrada, caso ocorra a liquidação\n  * **Health Factor:** saúde do seu empréstimo. **Quanto mais próximo de 1, maior será o risco de liquidação no protocolo.**\n* Compreendidos estes conceitos, vá até **Deposit.**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2MCaUZoEsXZdhJgSWlDYT.png?height=797&width=1641)\n\n* Insira a quantidade de FOX que você deseja depositar na *pool* da Agave e clique em **Continue**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2KhFtsud_yCXKgxbcJzI3.png?height=771&width=1645)\n\n* Aprove a interação do contrato inteligente da Agave Finance com a sua *wallet,* clicando em **Approve**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ab3z5C3MxmQMDEhnkgSqa.png?height=771&width=1643)\n\n* Vá até **Deposit** para aprovar o depósito dos FOXs na *pool.*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bq0XObGdNNinTo1kp_ugd.png?height=770&width=1646)\n\nFinalizadas todas as etapas, seus FOXs já estarão em *stake* na Agave Finance e **você receberá \\~43% APY !**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IB4vsXBxTHkNlQRE0yZ8r.png?height=723&width=1684)\n\nApós realizar o depósito, você poderá acessar o painel de controle da Agave. Nele, é possível gerenciar suas posições no protocolo de empréstimo e resgatar as recompensas recebidas com o *stake* dos tokens. Para isso, clique em **Claim,** no canto superior direto da tela.\n\nApesar de as recompensas obtidas com seus FOX já serem muito atrativas, há diferentes estratégias que você pode adotar para maximizá-las.\n\n**Mostraremos a você algumas delas 😉**\n\n## 🏆 Estratégias Para Maximizar Incentivos\n\nO uso de protocolos de empréstimo para aumentar as recompensas recebidas com *yield farming* é uma prática comum entre os mais degenerados em DeFi. O segredo é conseguir estruturar uma estratégia compatível com seu perfil.\n\nA principal maneira de maximizar os incentivos distribuídos pelo protocolo é *realizando reiterados depósitos e empréstimos numa pool*. Para você entender melhor como isso funciona, vamos tomar como exemplo a *pool* de FOX e a de USDC na Agave Finance.\n\nQuando depositamos nossos FOX, podemos emprestar uma porcentagem de qualquer um dos tokens disponíveis na aba **Market** do protocolo de empréstimo.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O5mhVOJnSIoIqkNmPH9GP.png?height=853&width=1645)\n\nObserve que o custo para realizar um empréstimo de FOX é menor que as recompensas obtidas com o depósito do token. Deste modo, as circunstâncias possibilitam você **realizar um *loop* entre depósitos e empréstimos.** Realizando essa estratégia, você não correrá o risco de ser liquidado, já que está usando um único ativo para depositar e emprestar.\n\nUma estratégia mais arriscada é depositar FOX e emprestar outras criptomoedas com juros menores, otimizando seus ganhos ao diminuir o custo do empréstimo: para emprestar USDC o juros a.a. é de 1.8%, enquanto no FOX é 39% a.a. Essa é a magia dos protocolos de empréstimo 🚀\n\nDeste modo, você pode optar por depositar seus FOX, emprestar USDC, convertê-lo para FOX na Honeyswap, fazer um novo depósito de FOX na *pool* da Agave e **seguir esse *loop* quantas vezes forem possíveis.** Lembre-se, que você pode emprestar **até 55% do depósito de FOX na Agave Finance.**\n\nFazendo isso, você consegue maximizar seus ganhos, ao aumentar sua posição em FOX, mas expõe-se ao risco da liquidação ao emprestar USDC. Por isso, essa estratégia deve ser usada com cautela pelos *degens.* Caso a adote, **monitore constantemente no painel de controle a saúde do seu empréstimo.**\n\nSeja emprestando FOX ou USDC, a Agave Finance provê ferramentas para você conseguir ir além dos 43% de APY pagos a você por depositar seus FOX no protocolo.\n\n**A magia da composibilidade e a liberdade de realizar operações como essa sem KYC é uma experiência somente possível no universo das Finanças Descentralizadas.**\n\nEste foi o Laboratório DeFi da semana, lhe ensinando mais uma maneira de receber recompensas com seus FOX e mostrando estratégias para maximizar seus lucros através da Agave Finance.\n\nTem dúvidas sobre os parâmetros dos empréstimos?

It seems like a way of doing a weekly group-check in. \n\nPros (my personal opinion) \n\n* it is nice to catch up, seeing real faces and talking with colleagues is just great. \n* It is enlightening to get an idea of what is going on on a CU-level, and\n* it is interesting to hear what everyone is working on.\n\nCons (my personal opinion - I have to be very careful here 😅)\n\n* If the lightning round is used as an accountability instrument, it is in my opinion not very well suited for that purpose. If a person attending the meeting is currently not that busy, this person risks putting him or herself at stake, and will risk looking redundant to the team/leader - this makes everyone want to sound busy and express why they are working on the most important thing in the World. I have to stress, that this is a very general assessment I make here, and it was not the case for any of the participants in this meeting! \n\nI have participated in similar meetings for years as an attorney and as a regulator, and I will probably end up introducing it in the CU I will be facilitating as well - I wonder if there is a better alternative?\n\n**My work today**\n\nI went through the DAO Resilience Improvement Strategic Initiative.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8)\n\nIt resonates with my view on prioritization, identifying the critical path is so important.\n\nI share the opinion that this must be done by starting out with the problems, risks, and challenges and working out solutions from there.\n\nAs I understand it from Wouter and Retro, the problems must be identified from forum posts, MIPs, Discord chats, etc. Getting an aggregated overview, grouping problems, etc. sounds like a great start.\n\nHowever, I also believe the person who will later be trying to solve the problem has to enter into a conversation with the people behind the forum posts before being able to actually understand the problem.\n\nI find Clayton M Christensen’s book Competing Against Luck comprehensive on how this kind of conversation/analysis can be conducted. \n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612](https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612)\n\nI know it’s easier said than done. And it would take a lot of time.\n\nIf an aggregated problem scoreboard is being built, my suggestion is to make sure the discord handle, email address, and name are always referred to, so the people behind the initial post can be identified and reached out in case of a conversation is needed at a later stage.\n\n**Thanks so much for the feedback!**\n\nI had some great feedback on my two first posts. This made me make some changes to the posts - thanks so much for helping me out 🙌", "timestamp": 1654291556, "digest": "69XObruzm8T8UfArADGp2Y78AkSOxMpt8B2EixT1kCE", "contributor": "0x3E842E7e894d589aF537682669A8A3574e0a932C"}
{"id": "6-_zkRYUlvLNfO5xz8gTC050kciKGX_psDDFjYu_EQU", "title": "Asymptote: a tale of eternity.", "body": "A long time ago, there was a being that traveled through the space from pole to pole, even knowing that it was infinite. Her name was Asymptote. Her life was an eternal search, because it was based on finding the guides of what she believed was the most important thing in her existence.\n\nOne day, when she was searching between Andromeda and The Milky Way, she found something very interesting. Some sidereal beings that were prowling through the space were returning from what was known as an Axis. They explained to Asymptote that this axis was a very important element for understanding the Universe, which would be discovered much later by beings called humans. The representation of that element was only seen by those who had an incredible ability to question its existence. And, as it was not for wonder, Asymptote lived her life on that questioning.\n\nAsymptote was dazzled by that discovery. The sidereal beings explained to her that that drawn Axis had been an imaginary projection of the Universe. They warned Asymptote that the Designer of the Universe had not defined if it would ever have an established purpose, so that they only appeared when He arranged for them to carry out some maintenance work on that axis. Asymptote without any hint of doubt, she hastened to answer that, since she was infinite in the Universe, she would begin the search for that end not determined by that lazy Designer. The sidereal beings only exchanged glances and drew a knowing smile.\n\nWithout further setbacks Asymptote began to sail towards the axis that was drawn very close from that astral point. Her smile was huge, she had never met anyone else like her. Someone infinite. Of course, she was forbidden to go to the end of the Universe. When the Designer of the Universe created her, she had outright forbidden it, because if she did not comply with that mandate, that Designer would put an end without discussion to her eternity. But Axis was different, it was only a few light years away, from her perspective. Little by little, Asymptote began to accelerate. Her speed increased as her emotions did. She was about to hit the speed of light, and suddenly, she almost crashed into a pair of planets that were orbiting a nearby solar system. She made up her mind to be more careful, though she didn't expect to slow down the speed she had achieved. Her smile resembled a rainbow that she had known when she crossed near a place called Earth.\n\nAsymptote was getting closer and closer to that axis. In a desperate move to get closer and faster, she made a quantum leap, leaving a wormhole in her wake. In her moments of despair, and due to her immense inner energy capacity, Asymptote had left behind her millions of wormholes throughout the Universe, which, with a little patience, can be found watching carefully to infinity. At the end of that quantum leap, Asymptote felt within herself something that she had never felt, since the beginning of her existence. Her energy was consumed with immense luminous combustion, she was, wherever she passed, the most visible sidereal element from far away. Every time she saw that axis approaching, she hurried a little more each time. Three millennia had passed, which for her was but a moment. But she could not see a significant advance. Asymptote was aware that the Universe was gigantic. But that seemed like a joke to her. Something infinite, like her, was unattainable. It had never happened to her.\n\nFrom that moment on, Asymptote would never stop pursuing her motive. What she believed was the destiny of her existence. From then on, Asymptote, the closer she gets to her Axis, the more she tends to the infinity of the Universe. Legend has it that if you see a comet in the night sky, it is Asymptote still desperately seeking to reach her Axis. Her destiny.\n\n> The End\n\n### Here is Asymptote looking for Axis through the eternity of the space.\n\n[edition://0xdA2C3deC213BCD250Db741A9Fb712896ce87fc25?editionId=0](edition://0xdA2C3deC213BCD250Db741A9Fb712896ce87fc25?editionId=0)\n\n## You can see what Asymptote is all about here:\n\n**Official project site**\n\n[https://lagrandisima.com/asymptote](https://lagrandisima.com/asymptote)\n\nBy backing this project you are letting me know that my team and I are becoming good at something.", "timestamp": 1654292038, "digest": "MstGTPRBfm-s3XC2fR9F_MdjsQVOGsqgTJOQn1CDjHU", "contributor": "0x69fcc58B05Dcb614D90B129A7218608bC313a4F4"}

It existed for millennia, without ever being discovered and for all that duration, was entirely barren of life. Stark, alone and empty, it would go on its lonely way, minding its own business, for many millennia more, until finally, it would go the way of all solar systems Unheeded and violently subsumed into darkness. Its single sun exploding into supernova, enveloping all.\n\nUntil then, its sun glows, its planets revolve and its rightful place remains, while right next door, in a system no less wonderful, perhaps more, an intriguing and populous universe spins.\n\nInside this spinning vortex, is the unassuming world of Zoasis, whose inhabitants will muddle into many more metaverse worlds than any of them had a right to. Not for them is the time honoured, if messy tradition of evolution. Instead, Zoasis, created wholesale, is coaxed into existence purposefully. Some might speculate on its origin, investing time and coin trying to fathom why this rebellious little place was coded into existence fully formed. I suspect you know by whom, otherwise you wouldn’t be here for my narration of this lore.\n\nTake a look back to the beginning. No big bang or broken ribs here. Just one small area of Zoasis. A perfect sanctuary, luscious, verdant, beautiful. Now, look closer, at the large tree at its centre, gnarled, old, and aromatic with sweet spice-tinged with earthy undertones. Closer still, in the shadow cast by that tree, a stunning red hue plays upon the trunk. Here, you will see an enormous glowing crystal. The light locked inside shines luminously, reflecting the rays of the world’s many distant suns, refracted by its prism. Warmth emanates from its depths, touching all.\n\nA creator who gently places six eggs around the base of the crystal relies on this warmth and more, counts on the longevity of the crystal. That its continued radiance will not only incubate the beloved eggs, but also power the sanctuary within which they reside, for all eternity. The eggs bask in the glow of the crystal. Its life-giving light radiates through them, as their maker planned.\n\nIt is with lofty intentions the altruistic creator banished themselves to the oblivion of anonymity, cutting themselves loose from their enterprise. Allowing no trace of their existence and exacting no credit for their design. People may search, pretenders make claims, but the architect is neither revealed nor held to account. Unforeseen circumstances change nothing. Trusting the creation to flourish, its creator recedes graciously.\n\nFor the sake of the Zoasis, maybe I should not have been so benevolent.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1654292830, "digest": "7HxJnsmnXHoQIcK4IjR3qkCujiy0SyJJ5zlVXlEbjSg", "contributor": "0x6C2A50316F9aBa4B04dBE22267915ca750117c46"}

Such token models allow holders to lock their holdings for a set period, creating long-term alignment between stakers and the protocol while decreasing the circulating token supply. Curve proved the efficacy of the model with the veCRV model. Following the success of veCRV, Balancer [recently introduced](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/vebal-is-live-aeda1ae13e20) veBAL.\n\nIntroducing [Aura Finance](https://aura.finance/), a protocol allowing BAL stakers and Balancer liquidity providers to boost their yield potential and governance power in an easy-to-use platform.\n\nWhile Balancer will be Aura’s initial focus, the protocol has been designed to operate agnostically toward other vote-locked or vote-escrowed tokens. That’s to say, Aura can extend its influence beyond Balancer to other DeFi protocols over time. Details about Aura’s roadmap will be shared at a future date.\n\nContributors to Aura are numerous DeFi OGs, many of which were active in and familiar with the intricacies of the first era of ve tokens and the subsequent “wars” that followed. Contributors are abiding by a strict security policy that involves multiple audits. More information about security practices can be found [here](https://mirror.xyz/0x97bA9Ec4d946366c75DE81734a51740Fffa7a300/e2f98UbakDnnX7c67hmPvQP6nllKz1WYaKs8PrGq6pc).\n\n## AURA\n\nA core tenet Aura is being built upon is that of community ownership. This will be accomplished through the AURA governance token.\n\nDistribution will not be focused on private investors or advisors; in fact, no tokens are being distributed to insiders aside from protocol contributors. Instead, a sizeable portion of the initial circulating token supply has been allocated to the Balancer community, along with stakeholders in the broader DeFi space, via airdrops.\n\n1\\.3% of the total AURA supply will be distributed to stakeholders and contributors to Balancer, inclusive of BAL holders, BAL BPT stakers, and veBAL holders.\n\nThose that voted “yes” on the proposal to [whitelist Aura for Balancer’s ‘votingescrow’](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708) contracts have been awarded an additional allocation equal to 3x their voting power. Those that voted “no” or abstained from voting will receive no bonus but have still been allocated an airdrop based on the BAL locked up in veBAL.\n\nAn additional 2% has been allocated to the Balancer community treasury with a two-year vesting schedule.\n\n”Power users” of DeFi have been allocated 1.2% of the total supply has been allocated to incentivize the involvement of a wide variety of addresses that have historically operated as active and aligned actors for other protocols:\n\n* 1% of the total supply will be airdropped to vlCVX holders\n* 0.2% of the total supply will be airdropped to holders of LobsterDAO NFTs\n\nTo further decentralize governance power and to incentivize wider participation, allocations across both categories **have been power-scaled**. (In layman, smaller holders will receive more AURA per BAL, vlCVX, or LobsterDAO NFT they hold relative to ‘whale’ holders). More information about the scaling of distribution can be found [here](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/usdaura/allocation-scaling-process).\n\n### Things to note\n\n* Users with the ability to claim tokens from either tranche will be given an option to 1) lock their AURA into vlAURA, or 2) immediately unlock their tokens and pay a 30% penalty (e.g. if a user has 100 AURA to claim and they chose to immediately unlock their allocation, they will receive 80 AURA and 30 AURA will be penalized)\n* AURA that is penalized will be collected to a contract and re-distributed to community members at a later date\n* Only EOAs and Gnosis Safe multi-sigs are eligible to claim AURA\n* There is a minimum AURA claim amount: users with allocations under this minimum will be excluded from the distribution to ensure an efficient claiming process and to avoid “dead supply”\n* Users will be required to sign a module agreeing to Aura terms and conditions to claim tokens\n* The airdrop will take place three days **after** the completion of the LBP.\n* **IMPORTANT: Snapshots of eligible addresses have already been taken** with block heights in the past, to avoid gaming of these airdrop allocations\n\n## LBP\n\nAura will also be conducting a Balancer-based liquidity bootstrapping pool (LBP) to properly kickstart the protocol.\n\nPerpetual Protocol did a great post [linked here](https://blog.perp.fi/why-we-chose-to-distribute-perp-using-a-balancer-liquidity-bootstrapping-pool-aac7f1ab6181) on why it makes sense to use an LBP over other distribution mechanisms for protocol bootstrapping.\n\nIf you don’t want to read Perp’s post, in short, an LBP disincentivizes bots from hogging a majority of supply, creates natural price discovery, and allows users to obtain AURA at a price point they feel comfortable at.\n\n2% of the AURA supply will be added to the LBP. ETH will be the base pair for the bootstrapping pool.\n\n37\\.5% of the WETH liquidity sourced from the LBP will be used to fund an 80/20 AURA-ETH pool on Balancer. The remainder of the WETH liquidity (62.5%) will be allocated to the TreasuryDAO to fund bug bounties and development costs as directed by token holders.\n\nThe treasury decisions will be executed by a multi-sig consisting of key community stakeholders and respected names in DeFi.\n\nThe LBP will run for four days (96 hours) and begin in early June. Any updates to the timeline and exact details regarding the LBP will be conveyed via our social media channels, such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aurafinance) and Discord. Please beware of phishing attempts. You can bookmark/follow social channels to avoid such attempts.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nThe components of the initial token distribution laid out above only represent the first phase of Aura’s launch.\n\nFuture posts will outline the overall token distribution, along with highly-incentivized launch pools and rewards being put in place to catalyze a flywheel to incentivize further veBAL staking, governance participation, and efficient farming for the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nAura’s contributors are excited to make an impact on Balancer in a similar way to how Convex impacted and catalyzed Curve’s growth in both usage and mindshare in DeFi.\n\n\n____\n\nAhead of the AURA token and subsequent Aura protocol launch, feel free to join the conversation and take a role in our community via our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aurafinance) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/aurafinance).\n\nStay tuned for further information!\n\nSee you soon.", "timestamp": 1654294536, "digest": "pHF9FFR2sn2ZTLNh6YCyCivb0p7W_uPB5m4diS4jz58", "contributor": "0x21F0c2b5102951938481d8d8Ed8eCd97596eC915"}

{"id": "Poz6mXYuUSAi1pU29wY9Vv755TNDVgDSLHbtuER2J8o", "title": "Collectooors Lore Expansion", "body": "The year is 2069. I am watching a beautiful sunset from a floating porch 5,000 feet off the ground, and my bright-eyed granddaughter hoverboards up to join me. She is fascinated by the ancient history I’ve lived through, specifically the Great Metavolution, as we now call it. \n\n“Grandma,” she says, “tell me again how you made it out of the basement those bad guys put you in. How did you even survive without ultra-high-speed internet beamed from towers on the moon?” \n\n“Ah, right, the Faraday cage,” I murmur to her as my brain shifts focus almost five decades back, to the days of DM scams and having to pay for gas fees. The images get clearer and clearer as I remember Luna blowing up, Bored Ape Yacht Club taking the world by storm, and Index Coop putting BlackRock out of business and disrupting the financial system as we know it. \n\nIt all happened so fast. It had to be done. \n\nI tell my granddaughter, “I was 27 years old and found my tribe with people I met through an app on my phone...” \n\n“What’s a phone?” she interrupts. \n\n“Don’t worry about it, it’s all built into your glasses now,” I continue. \n\n“... we know ourselves as Collectooors. We were early and we were confident. Some people didn’t like that. Some people didn’t believe that art could be pixels; a collection of data points within a smart contract that is very much alive. Just like you and I grow, change, and mature... so can art. NFTs can evolve, be affected by their surroundings, and to a point capture the deep emotion that a Collectooor shares with the piece and its native home – the technology.” \n\nMy granddaughter’s mouth is wide open. I pause and she asks, “why did they try to stop you and the other Collectooors? Doesn’t everyone like art, and technology? A world without art and technology is like a world without ice cream and pizza!” \n\nI chuckle, “we had those good things back then too, and good things survive. That’s why the Collectooors stood strong, curating collections through the years, even during the dark times we had to stay in the shadows and continue building on our own. Why stop us? They tried, but to no avail. I think at the end of the day, we were misunderstood. People thought we were going against what society once valued for the wrong reasons – they would say ‘if you can’t touch it, it’s not real’ … ‘you’re paying for air’ … ‘I can just right click & save this.’” \n\nI gaze out to the fading golden orb that is the sun, the clouds glowing orange with pink undertones. I take a deep breath, the nostalgia overwhelming my senses in the best way possible. \n\n“Some people don’t like it when you challenge their status quo. The way things have been done, the familiar. Collectoors changed all that. We gave power to the people, to the artists, innovators. To the curators, the lovers of the intersection of art & technology. Gold mines ended up being discovered through projects the Collectooors aped into and helped introduce to the world. Some people just didn’t want to share,” I drift back into thought. Oh the opportunities I slept on, the late nights on Discord with the Collectooors. We had so much fun. \n\nMy daughter’s glasses start to ring, literally. I hear a subtle, sweet tone. Something must be ready. \n\n“Grandma!! My metaDoggo just minted a metaPup! I gotta show...” she drifts away, eagerly gets back on her hoverboard. I’m proud of my granddaughter for being kind, for valuing the beauty of technology, the power of art. She is very much a Collectooor, if you ask me.  \n\nI smile as I follow her silhouette descending back to the house. A home her grandpa and I were able to build with our bare hands thanks to some early bets we made with the Collectooors. \n\nThey said we weren’t going to make it. \n\nWell, here we are, and we’re not going anywhere. \n\nTo be continued...", "timestamp": 1654295690, "digest": "bjC3wtIgyuJd-kYcVQva3OjPu5ZAw38zm8H_E1R1xuM", "contributor": "0xa431d9aE84CcE1c1c6d28f8258B5b95bAB930210"}

**执行(Execution), 共识(Consensus), 数据可用性(Data Availability)**。单体化和模块化是相对概念，也是工程学发展的一种必然趋势。\n\n### 2.2 单体化区块链工作流程\n\n* 用户发送交易至节点\n* 节点验证交易的有效性，执行交易，状态转换，如果有效则并放入内存池进行广播，否则抛弃交易回滚状态- **执行(Execution)**\n* 节点生成区块头，从内存池中选择一组交易，排序并放入区块，生成区块体，将区块存储到本地 -

**BitTorrent**。\n\n## 4. 数据可用性(Data Availability)\n\n### 4.1 数据可用性的出现\n\n* 数据可用性最初不是问题，L1中的数据是自然可用的。但是我们现在面临着扩容的剧变，数据可用性才成为一个不可避免的话题。只有保证所有交易数据的**可访问和可下载**，L1或者轻节点才能对Rollup 上的状态进行**跟踪和重构**。\n\n### 4.2 DA是必不可少？\n\n#### 轻节点验证数据可用性困境\n\n![Path For Using Merkle Tree To Verify Tx](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ym6WUT_46t1mfgpqVjip1.jpg?height=468&width=1011)\n\n* 比特币在设计时就提出了 [SPV(Simple Payment Verification)](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Simplified_Payment_Verification) 的概念，即使不运行网络的全节点也可以使用网络的方式。这类节点称为轻节点，它们只下载区块头，不下载具体的交易数据，不会去验证交易的可用性，只保证同步的是最新的区块头，也就是**只能确保区块是有效的，对于区块内交易的可用性则是完全信任全节点的**。\n* 因为交易数据是记录为 Merkle Tree 的结构，轻节点虽然拥有验证某条交易的可用性的能力，但是对于全节点恶意隐藏或是扣留的交易数据，轻节点由于只有区块头，是很难确认具体哪条交易信息是无效的，除非下载全部交易数据，总结就是**确认交易无效容易，确认交易是否存在是困难的**。\n* 传统分片(Sharding)扩容方式中，矿工会被分配到不同的分片上处理该分片的工作。矿工需要运行该分片的全节点加上其它分片的轻节点来保证跨分片操作的能力。因为分片安全的分割性，如果某个分片的节点作恶，很容易出现上面描述的轻节点验证数据可用性困境，大大降低分片的性能与安全性。\n\n#### Rollup强依赖数据可用性保证\n\n![Rollup-centric](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1BnWsv954Hgmo8V1obtjw.png?height=1303&width=1400)\n\n* **Optimistic Rollup**\n  * 在 Optimistic Rollup 扩容方式中，运用一种称为 **Sequencer** 的高性能服务器对交易进行验证与执行，最终将交易批量打包(batch)传回L1进行储存。Sequencer 是更加中心化的节点，处理速度非常快，L1的共识层是无法跟上这样的处理速度进行共识的，所以为了防止 Sequencer 的作恶，我们先假设 Sequencer 处理的工作是有效的，然后还有一类角色负责定期从L1读取 Sequencer 提交的交易来区块的有效性，如果发现有无效交易则可以提交欺诈证明(Fraud Proof)来进行可用性挑战，如果数据最后被认定无效，则 Sequencer上的状态也会回滚至有效前。\n  * 这里的问题时，如果要验证Sequencer提交的交易的可用性，**需要先保证Sequencer提交了所有它验证过的交易，没有隐藏或是扣留等**，也就是需要保证数据的可用性，否则是无法进行欺诈证明验证的。Optimistic 和 Arbitrum 等 Rollup现在的解决方法是将所有交易发回以太坊，以太坊来进行数据可用性工作\n* **ZK Rollup**\n  * 对于 **ZK Rollup(Zk-SNARK/Zk-STARK)的 Sequencer** 来说，不存在欺诈性证明问题，在提交batch交易时还需要同时提交零知识可用性证明，只要证明是有效的，则交易一定是有效的。即便如此也还是需要将交易数据发送回L1进行记录，为了防止有一天此Rollup服务终止后，用户依然可以用L1上保存的数据恢复账户状态，避免资金在Rollup中的锁死。这个时候如果没有数据可用性保证，也就无法恢复正确的链上状态。这个也被称为Rollup链上状态持久性问题。\n\n### 4.3 DA扩容问题\n\n#### 吞吐量\n\n* **受限于底层区块大小限制**，区块大小其实是共识层和数据可用性层共同的问题。以太坊为例，区块大小的均值在 50-60kb，区块大小限制了单位区块可以包含的交易数量。Rollup 现在是将批量交易(batch)信息通过 calldata 字段进行压缩保存，其效率必然受限于单个区块可容纳交易限制。\n* **受限于底层数据可用性验证效率限制**，现在的 Rollup 例如 Optimism，数据可用性依然依赖 L1(以太坊)来进行，和单体化时期并没有区别，全节点下载所有交易，通过L1上的智能合约计算 Merkle Tree 等方式来验证区块内所有交易的可用性，然后进行本地保存，网络中所有节点都需要重复这个步骤。以太坊的TPS在14左右，数据可用性验证也差不多是这个速率，可见数据可用性验证的效率对Rollup效率影响之大。\n\n#### 存储成本\n\n![L2Fees.info](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SA8YxI6VmFutgXGZEdRmQ.png?height=722&width=895)\n\n* **受限于底层存储成本限制**，因为存储的高昂费用，使得用户最敏感的交易费用在L2上并没有得到大幅度的减少。现在Rollup的费率主要由固定成本与可变成本两部分组成。其中对于Rollup费率影响最大的便是calldata的存储费率16gas / byte。\n  * **固定成本**：L1 Base Tx Fee 21000 + 状态写入成本 20000\n  * **动态成本**：L2 Base Fee(可忽略不计) + calldata 写入成本(16gas / byte)\n* 数据可用性的存储和通用的存储是有区别的。数据可用性存储不会对大文件存储做优化，反而需要对数据验证做更多优化。可以看[这篇](https://0xzx.com/2022050907022285892.html)了解更多。\n\n### 4.4 DA扩容技术\n\n#### 二维R-S纠删码(2D Reed-Solomon Erasure Coding)\n\n![How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gJHd-dRFYqUdfI9KTl_Vn.png?height=730&width=624)\n\n* 纠删码是在原始数据上附加一些额外的数据，保证原始数据在一定的兀余度内的丢失都是可以通过算法恢复的，几乎所有分布式数据网络中为了保证数据的冗余性都会使用纠删码进行数据可用性保护，CD-ROM 上也大量使用纠删码来保证一定程度的物理损坏不会导致数据遗失。\n* 二维R-S纠删码是一种数据编码方式，解决的问题是**通过增加数据兀余度与采用特别的数据排列方式，帮助节点无需下载所有交易的情况下就可以快速验证数据的可用性**。全节点将数据附加纠删码后，再被切分为横纵轴数量一样的带有奇偶校验数据的数据分片，现在数据呈二维平面排列，然后计算出行和列的 Merkle Root，同时也需要用行和列的 Merkle Root 计算一个整体数据的 Merkle Root， 放入区块头信息中供之后快速校验。\n* 可以看出一个全节点如果想隐藏一笔交易，那几乎就不可能了，因为任何的修改都会导致二维数据矩阵实质性的变化，非常容易被检测出来。网络内全节点如果检测到任何数据有效性问题，也会通过数据有效性欺诈证明来快速通知轻节点。\n\n#### 数据可用性采样(Data Availability Sampling)\n\n![How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xsfy56AeSBKUS2IgY4HMi.png?height=488&width=1012)\n\n* **数据可用性采样 + 二维R-S纠删码**几乎是数据可用性项目的通用设计了，也是几个项目技术细节上有差异化的地方。以太坊的Dank Sharding也不断在进行数据可用性采样方面的研究。\n* 在交易数据完成二维R-S纠删码编码，区块头也广播之后。轻节点就可以通过区块头中的行与列的 Merkle Root 计算出整体数据的 Merkle Root 并与区块头中的数据进行对比。如果整体数据的 Merkle Root 没有问题的话，轻节点再进行一个非常小的数据采样测试。例如随机选择第3行与第5列，之后就是与 SPV 中轻节点验证交易可用性方式一样了，要求全节点返回计算需要用到的节点路径进行哈希计算。最后再与全节点给出的第3列与第5行的 Merkle State 数据做对比就完成了一次采样验证。\n* 这个方案最重要也是最美妙的一点在于，**验证数据量与计算量很小，支持大量轻节点的加入，并且节点数量越多，区块的可用性概率也越高整个网络也越安全**，对于检测数据隐藏或者扣留的情况非常高效。\n\n#### 命名空间默克尔树(Namespaced Merkle Tree)\n\n* 这个是 Celestia 首先提出的技术，简单说就是将整个默克尔状态树划分了归属，全节点做验证时只需要下载自己归属下的那部分树结构就可以了。这样的好处是可以同时支持不同的执行层数据的可用性验证。这个设计充分体现了Celestia的模块化主义与多Rollup并存的展望。技术细节可以参考[这篇文章](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Y4avtYdyES45EBkhHp07XA)。\n\n#### KZG承诺(Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg Commitment)\n\n![KZG Commitments](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1RqExMG81sUqSEAZlwU0z.png?height=532&width=1778)\n\n* 使用 KZG 作为数据可用性的状态根最来自于以太坊的 Danksharding 方案。KZG承诺的作用和 Merkle Root 一样，是对于整体状态的一种证明方式(proof of inclusion)，可以看做另一种 Merkle Root，只不过它哈希的不是数据，而是多项式。数据量更小，可用性证明更加高效，而且所有叶子节点都在同一个 polynomial(多项式)上，通过增加叶子节点就可以进行纠删码编码(Erasure Coding友好)。\n\n## 5. Danksharding\n\n![Danksharding](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oi1Pe3E5xB_7lph9DBTqE.jpg?height=623&width=1400)\n\n### 5.1 Proto-Danksharding(EIP-4844)\n\n* Proto-Danksharding 是 Danksharding 的一个早期先行版本。在交易信息中包含了一个额外的存储空间字段 - **blob**。每个blob有 128kb 空间，每个交易最多有两个blob，每个区块最多包含16个blob，blob不可以被EVM执行。blob都使用 KZG 承诺进行多项式哈希，用于之后的数据可用性验证。之前Rollup的批处理batch数据都是通过 calldate 字段传入L1，现在可以直接放到blob中。\n* 这里最重要的是，**blob不是永久存储的，可以理解为有时效性的缓存**，每隔一段时间(30天)以太坊上的blob数据是会被清除的，通过这种缓存的方式来减轻以太坊的存储压力以及减少存储费率。因为30天后blob数据会被清理，所以需要自行存储这些历史交易数据。以太坊共识层的目的不是保证永远保存所有历史数据。相反，其目的是提供一个高度安全的实时公告板，将历史数据存储的工作交给其它更适合的网络来进行，以太坊也在全力转向模块化趋势。\n\n### 5.2 Danksharding\n\n* Danksharding 是以太坊的新分片设计提案，围绕 [Rollup-Centric](https://polynya.medium.com/understanding-ethereums-rollup-centric-roadmap-1c60d30c060f) 的以太坊发展路线，提出了很多数据可用性层相关的改进。此分片方案给 rollup 的批处理batch数据提供大量的存储空间 blob。以太坊协议本身并不试图解译这些blob，验证一个 blob 只需要检查该 blob 是否可用——即它能否从网络上下载。这些 blob 的数据空间预期是为支持高吞吐量交易的二层 rollup 协议所用的。\n* Danksharding 将 Proto-Danksharding 中blob数量提升了**16倍**，最大交易大小从2M上升到32M, 目标交易大小从1M提升到16M。blobs 分散存储在 Becon Chain 上，单独作为数据可用性层工作。依然是运用纠删码技术，每个节点只保存blob的数据片段，整个网络来保证blob的数据的完整性(和 BitTorrent 一样)。blob使用数据可用性采样(DAS)的方式配合 KZG 状态根来验证数据可用性，提交提交 attestation，attestation 达到阈值则认为block有效。再配合 EIP-4488 来减少 calldata 的存储费用，包括提供独立的数据有效性分片来存储blob，可以说是在数据可用性扩容上全力导向 Rollup-Centric 发展路线了。\n\n## 6. Celestia\n\n![Celestia Modular Stack](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q4VEiP_O99VAmCx5p8l6S.png?height=614&width=1008)\n\n* Celestia 是近期最重要的模块化区块链项目，也是推进数据可用性与模块化区块链落地的先驱。构建于 CosmosSDK 之上，专注于提供数据可用性服务，不执行任何交易。他们率先提出了让轻节点使用二维R-S纠删码进行数据可用性验证，同时开发了命名空间默克尔树来支持多种 Rollup，也提出了量子引力桥(Quantum Gravity Bridge)使用 Celestia 作为以太坊数据可用性层的扩容方案。\n* CEO Mustafa Al-Bassam是 Chainspace 的 Co-Funder，这个项目后来被 Facebook 收购。首席研究员 John Adler 来自 ConsenSys,曾经帮助 Optimism 完成了第一版技术规范。\n* **我觉得模块化在社区的兴起大部分是因为Celestia描述了一种全新的模块化区块链技术栈，其中以Rollup + Cevmos + Celestia的组合受到最多关注。Cevmos是Celestia与Evmos团队合作推出的模块化结算层，使用Optimint(Optimistic Tendermint)共识, 基本是完全为EVM Rollup优化的，还结合了Cosmos网络的互操作性，组合性等优势，十分值得期待。**\n\n## 7. Polygon Avail\n\n![Layer2 Aggregator](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ClWOt5fETUXlFq10Y3-fU.jpg?height=1039&width=1080)\n\n* 谈到L2怎么能少了号称layer2聚合器的Polygon。Avail是Celestia的竞品，作为polygon的layer2聚合器版图的一部份，构建于Substrate之上，专注于数据可用性层的服务。**在我看Avail也是最有可能在Polkadot生态出现原生的数据有效层项目前的DA选择方案之一。Celestia已经为Cosmos生态描绘出一种极高灵活度与扩展性的架构，我相信Substrate生态也会不甘落后的。**\n* Avail 的思路与 Celestia 基本相同，区别主要在于纠删码的生成以及采样验证环节。Avail 在二维R-S纠删码编码阶段大量使用KZG承诺。Avail将数据展开为n \\* m的矩阵，对每一行都构造一个多项式，然后为每一个多项式都生成一个 KZG 承诺放入区块头。之后轻节点便只需要原始数据和 KZG 承诺便可完成可用性验证。\n\n![Introducing Avail by Polygon — a Robust General-Purpose Scalable Data Availability Layer — Polygon | Blog](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9aQ9_KDQYvuP7mOD2oLKx.png?height=465&width=800)\n\n## 8.

**BitTorrent**。\n\n## 4. 数据可用性(Data Availability)\n\n### 4.1 数据可用性的出现\n\n* 数据可用性最初不是问题，L1中的数据是自然可用的。但是我们现在面临着扩容的剧变，数据可用性才成为一个不可避免的话题。只有保证所有交易数据的**可访问和可下载**，L1或者轻节点才能对Rollup 上的状态进行**跟踪和重构**。\n\n### 4.2 DA是必不可少？\n\n#### 轻节点验证数据可用性困境\n\n![Path For Using Merkle Tree To Verify Tx](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ym6WUT_46t1mfgpqVjip1.jpg?height=468&width=1011)\n\n* 比特币在设计时就提出了 [SPV(Simple Payment Verification)](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Simplified_Payment_Verification) 的概念，即使不运行网络的全节点也可以使用网络的方式。这类节点称为轻节点，它们只下载区块头，不下载具体的交易数据，不会去验证交易的可用性，只保证同步的是最新的区块头，也就是**只能确保区块是有效的，对于区块内交易的可用性则是完全信任全节点的**。\n* 因为交易数据是记录为 Merkle Tree 的结构，轻节点虽然拥有验证某条交易的可用性的能力，但是对于全节点恶意隐藏或是扣留的交易数据，轻节点由于只有区块头，是很难确认具体哪条交易信息是无效的，除非下载全部交易数据，总结就是**确认交易无效容易，确认交易是否存在是困难的**。\n* 传统分片(Sharding)扩容方式中，矿工会被分配到不同的分片上处理该分片的工作。矿工需要运行该分片的全节点加上其它分片的轻节点来保证跨分片操作的能力。因为分片安全的分割性，如果某个分片的节点作恶，很容易出现上面描述的轻节点验证数据可用性困境，大大降低分片的性能与安全性。\n\n#### Rollup强依赖数据可用性保证\n\n![Rollup-centric](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1BnWsv954Hgmo8V1obtjw.png?height=1303&width=1400)\n\n* **Optimistic Rollup**\n  * 在 Optimistic Rollup 扩容方式中，运用一种称为 **Sequencer** 的高性能服务器对交易进行验证与执行，最终将交易批量打包(batch)传回L1进行储存。Sequencer 是更加中心化的节点，处理速度非常快，L1的共识层是无法跟上这样的处理速度进行共识的，所以为了防止 Sequencer 的作恶，我们先假设 Sequencer 处理的工作是有效的，然后还有一类角色负责定期从L1读取 Sequencer 提交的交易来区块的有效性，如果发现有无效交易则可以提交欺诈证明(Fraud Proof)来进行可用性挑战，如果数据最后被认定无效，则 Sequencer上的状态也会回滚至有效前。\n  * 这里的问题时，如果要验证Sequencer提交的交易的可用性，**需要先保证Sequencer提交了所有它验证过的交易，没有隐藏或是扣留等**，也就是需要保证数据的可用性，否则是无法进行欺诈证明验证的。Optimistic 和 Arbitrum 等 Rollup现在的解决方法是将所有交易发回以太坊，以太坊来进行数据可用性工作\n* **ZK Rollup**\n  * 对于 **ZK Rollup(Zk-SNARK/Zk-STARK)的 Sequencer** 来说，不存在欺诈性证明问题，在提交batch交易时还需要同时提交零知识可用性证明，只要证明是有效的，则交易一定是有效的。即便如此也还是需要将交易数据发送回L1进行记录，为了防止有一天此Rollup服务终止后，用户依然可以用L1上保存的数据恢复账户状态，避免资金在Rollup中的锁死。这个时候如果没有数据可用性保证，也就无法恢复正确的链上状态。这个也被称为Rollup链上状态持久性问题。\n\n### 4.3 DA扩容问题\n\n#### 吞吐量\n\n* **受限于底层区块大小限制**，区块大小其实是共识层和数据可用性层共同的问题。以太坊为例，区块大小的均值在 50-60kb，区块大小限制了单位区块可以包含的交易数量。Rollup 现在是将批量交易(batch)信息通过 calldata 字段进行压缩保存，其效率必然受限于单个区块可容纳交易限制。\n* **受限于底层数据可用性验证效率限制**，现在的 Rollup 例如 Optimism，数据可用性依然依赖 L1(以太坊)来进行，和单体化时期并没有区别，全节点下载所有交易，通过L1上的智能合约计算 Merkle Tree 等方式来验证区块内所有交易的可用性，然后进行本地保存，网络中所有节点都需要重复这个步骤。以太坊的TPS在14左右，数据可用性验证也差不多是这个速率，可见数据可用性验证的效率对Rollup效率影响之大。\n\n#### 存储成本\n\n![L2Fees.info](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SA8YxI6VmFutgXGZEdRmQ.png?height=722&width=895)\n\n* **受限于底层存储成本限制**，因为存储的高昂费用，使得用户最敏感的交易费用在L2上并没有得到大幅度的减少。现在Rollup的费率主要由固定成本与可变成本两部分组成。其中对于Rollup费率影响最大的便是calldata的存储费率16gas / byte。\n  * **固定成本**：L1 Base Tx Fee 21000 + 状态写入成本 20000\n  * **动态成本**：L2 Base Fee(可忽略不计) + calldata 写入成本(16gas / byte)\n* 数据可用性的存储和通用的存储是有区别的。数据可用性存储不会对大文件存储做优化，反而需要对数据验证做更多优化。可以看[这篇](https://0xzx.com/2022050907022285892.html)了解更多。\n\n### 4.4 DA扩容技术\n\n#### 二维R-S纠删码(2D Reed-Solomon Erasure Coding)\n\n![How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gJHd-dRFYqUdfI9KTl_Vn.png?height=730&width=624)\n\n* 纠删码是在原始数据上附加一些额外的数据，保证原始数据在一定的兀余度内的丢失都是可以通过算法恢复的，几乎所有分布式数据网络中为了保证数据的冗余性都会使用纠删码进行数据可用性保护，CD-ROM 上也大量使用纠删码来保证一定程度的物理损坏不会导致数据遗失。\n* 二维R-S纠删码是一种数据编码方式，解决的问题是**通过增加数据兀余度与采用特别的数据排列方式，帮助节点无需下载所有交易的情况下就可以快速验证数据的可用性**。全节点将数据附加纠删码后，再被切分为横纵轴数量一样的带有奇偶校验数据的数据分片，现在数据呈二维平面排列，然后计算出行和列的 Merkle Root，同时也需要用行和列的 Merkle Root 计算一个整体数据的 Merkle Root， 放入区块头信息中供之后快速校验。\n* 可以看出一个全节点如果想隐藏一笔交易，那几乎就不可能了，因为任何的修改都会导致二维数据矩阵实质性的变化，非常容易被检测出来。网络内全节点如果检测到任何数据有效性问题，也会通过数据有效性欺诈证明来快速通知轻节点。\n\n#### 数据可用性采样(Data Availability Sampling)\n\n![How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xsfy56AeSBKUS2IgY4HMi.png?height=488&width=1012)\n\n* **数据可用性采样 + 二维R-S纠删码**几乎是数据可用性项目的通用设计了，也是几个项目技术细节上有差异化的地方。以太坊的Dank Sharding也不断在进行数据可用性采样方面的研究。\n* 在交易数据完成二维R-S纠删码编码，区块头也广播之后。轻节点就可以通过区块头中的行与列的 Merkle Root 计算出整体数据的 Merkle Root 并与区块头中的数据进行对比。如果整体数据的 Merkle Root 没有问题的话，轻节点再进行一个非常小的数据采样测试。例如随机选择第3行与第5列，之后就是与 SPV 中轻节点验证交易可用性方式一样了，要求全节点返回计算需要用到的节点路径进行哈希计算。最后再与全节点给出的第3列与第5行的 Merkle State 数据做对比就完成了一次采样验证。\n* 这个方案最重要也是最美妙的一点在于，**验证数据量与计算量很小，支持大量轻节点的加入，并且节点数量越多，区块的可用性概率也越高整个网络也越安全**，对于检测数据隐藏或者扣留的情况非常高效。\n\n#### 命名空间默克尔树(Namespaced Merkle Tree)\n\n* 这个是 Celestia 首先提出的技术，简单说就是将整个默克尔状态树划分了归属，全节点做验证时只需要下载自己归属下的那部分树结构就可以了。这样的好处是可以同时支持不同的执行层数据的可用性验证。这个设计充分体现了Celestia的模块化主义与多Rollup并存的展望。技术细节可以参考[这篇文章](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Y4avtYdyES45EBkhHp07XA)。\n\n#### KZG承诺(Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg Commitment)\n\n![KZG Commitments](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1RqExMG81sUqSEAZlwU0z.png?height=532&width=1778)\n\n* 使用 KZG 作为数据可用性的状态根最来自于以太坊的 Danksharding 方案。KZG承诺的作用和 Merkle Root 一样，是对于整体状态的一种证明方式(proof of inclusion)，可以看做另一种 Merkle Root，只不过它哈希的不是数据，而是多项式。数据量更小，可用性证明更加高效，而且所有叶子节点都在同一个 polynomial(多项式)上，通过增加叶子节点就可以进行纠删码编码(Erasure Coding友好)。\n\n## 5. Danksharding\n\n![Danksharding](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oi1Pe3E5xB_7lph9DBTqE.jpg?height=623&width=1400)\n\n### 5.1 Proto-Danksharding(EIP-4844)\n\n* Proto-Danksharding 是 Danksharding 的一个早期先行版本。在交易信息中包含了一个额外的存储空间字段 - **blob**。每个blob有 128kb 空间，每个交易最多有两个blob，每个区块最多包含16个blob，blob不可以被EVM执行。blob都使用 KZG 承诺进行多项式哈希，用于之后的数据可用性验证。之前Rollup的批处理batch数据都是通过 calldate 字段传入L1，现在可以直接放到blob中。\n* 这里最重要的是，**blob不是永久存储的，可以理解为有时效性的缓存**，每隔一段时间(30天)以太坊上的blob数据是会被清除的，通过这种缓存的方式来减轻以太坊的存储压力以及减少存储费率。因为30天后blob数据会被清理，所以需要自行存储这些历史交易数据。以太坊共识层的目的不是保证永远保存所有历史数据。相反，其目的是提供一个高度安全的实时公告板，将历史数据存储的工作交给其它更适合的网络来进行，以太坊也在全力转向模块化趋势。\n\n### 5.2 Danksharding\n\n* Danksharding 是以太坊的新分片设计提案，围绕 [Rollup-Centric](https://polynya.medium.com/understanding-ethereums-rollup-centric-roadmap-1c60d30c060f) 的以太坊发展路线，提出了很多数据可用性层相关的改进。此分片方案给 rollup 的批处理batch数据提供大量的存储空间 blob。以太坊协议本身并不试图解译这些blob，验证一个 blob 只需要检查该 blob 是否可用——即它能否从网络上下载。这些 blob 的数据空间预期是为支持高吞吐量交易的二层 rollup 协议所用的。\n* Danksharding 将 Proto-Danksharding 中blob数量提升了**16倍**，最大交易大小从2M上升到32M, 目标交易大小从1M提升到16M。blobs 分散存储在 Becon Chain 上，单独作为数据可用性层工作。依然是运用纠删码技术，每个节点只保存blob的数据片段，整个网络来保证blob的数据的完整性(和 BitTorrent 一样)。blob使用数据可用性采样(DAS)的方式配合 KZG 状态根来验证数据可用性，提交提交 attestation，attestation 达到阈值则认为block有效。再配合 EIP-4488 来减少 calldata 的存储费用，包括提供独立的数据有效性分片来存储blob，可以说是在数据可用性扩容上全力导向 Rollup-Centric 发展路线了。\n\n## 6. Celestia\n\n![Celestia Modular Stack](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q4VEiP_O99VAmCx5p8l6S.png?height=614&width=1008)\n\n* Celestia 是近期最重要的模块化区块链项目，也是推进数据可用性与模块化区块链落地的先驱。构建于 CosmosSDK 之上，专注于提供数据可用性服务，不执行任何交易。他们率先提出了让轻节点使用二维R-S纠删码进行数据可用性验证，同时开发了命名空间默克尔树来支持多种 Rollup，也提出了量子引力桥(Quantum Gravity Bridge)使用 Celestia 作为以太坊数据可用性层的扩容方案。\n* CEO Mustafa Al-Bassam是 Chainspace 的 Co-Funder，这个项目后来被 Facebook 收购。首席研究员 John Adler 来自 ConsenSys,曾经帮助 Optimism 完成了第一版技术规范。\n* **我觉得模块化在社区的兴起大部分是因为Celestia描述了一种全新的模块化区块链技术栈，其中以Rollup + Cevmos + Celestia的组合受到最多关注。Cevmos是Celestia与Evmos团队合作推出的模块化结算层，使用Optimint(Optimistic Tendermint)共识, 基本是完全为EVM Rollup优化的，还结合了Cosmos网络的互操作性，组合性等优势，十分值得期待。**\n\n## 7. Polygon Avail\n\n![Layer2 Aggregator](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ClWOt5fETUXlFq10Y3-fU.jpg?height=1039&width=1080)\n\n* 谈到L2怎么能少了号称layer2聚合器的Polygon。Avail是Celestia的竞品，作为polygon的layer2聚合器版图的一部份，构建于Substrate之上，专注于数据可用性层的服务。**在我看Avail也是最有可能在Polkadot生态出现原生的数据有效层项目前的DA选择方案之一。Celestia已经为Cosmos生态描绘出一种极高灵活度与扩展性的架构，我相信Substrate生态也会不甘落后的。**\n* Avail 的思路与 Celestia 基本相同，区别主要在于纠删码的生成以及采样验证环节。Avail 在二维R-S纠删码编码阶段大量使用KZG承诺。Avail将数据展开为n \\* m的矩阵，对每一行都构造一个多项式，然后为每一个多项式都生成一个 KZG 承诺放入区块头。之后轻节点便只需要原始数据和 KZG 承诺便可完成可用性验证。\n\n![Introducing Avail by Polygon — a Robust General-Purpose Scalable Data Availability Layer — Polygon | Blog](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9aQ9_KDQYvuP7mOD2oLKx.png?height=465&width=800)\n\n## 8. Startwar Validium & ZkSync ZkPorter\n\n* Validium 和 ZkPorter 是 Zk-Rollup 两大巨头 Startware 与 ZkSync 推出的自家链下存储服务。本质是是为了解决上述L1的瓶颈舒服Rollup快速大规模应用的问题，通过将交易数据存储在为Zk交易数据优化过的相对中心化的网络中而不是以太坊来大幅降低交易费用。我觉得这是对于以太坊过于缓慢开发进度的一种折衷方案。毕竟安全性是有代价的，不过这样服务的出现肯定也能打中一批目标用户。\n\n## 9. 参考\n\n[Celestia 101 - 模块化区块链 — Yicheng (mirror.xyz)](https://mirror.xyz/yicheng.eth/7q29a3lMXkG2f51-BrTLxovS3tqnwf4qi7_VWFhnqKc)\n\n[研究｜Celestia会成为DA模块的头牌吗？ (qq.com)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Y4avtYdyES45EBkhHp07XA)\n\n[Why Do We Need Modular Blockchains For Scalability? | by Yong kang Chia | Apr, 2022 | Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-we-need-modular-blockchains-for-scalability-276f4d724b0e)\n\n[WTF is Data Availability?. and why solving the “data availability… | by Yuan Han Li | Blockchain Capital Blog | Medium](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/wtf-is-data-availability-80c2c95ded0f)\n\n[A Non-Technical Introduction to Rollups – Mechanism Capital](https://www.mechanism.capital/rollups-introduction/)\n\n[What Is Data Availability? | Alexandria (coinmarketcap.com)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-data-availability)\n\n[How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://medium.com/huobi-research/how-the-data-availability-layer-can-shape-the-future-of-blockchain-83274b64d2c)\n\n[Celestia MVP 发布：数据可用性采样轻客户端 — W3.Hitchhiker (mirror.xyz)](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/T9MoM-3p_xNIx7I5k-UzmfKqGBQaDQmdvGw4K8bFMTA)\n\n[Vitalik: Proto-Danksharding FAQ | 登链社区 | 区块链技术社区 (learnblockchain.cn)](https://learnblockchain.cn/article/3769)\n\n[基础数据结构 :: 以太坊技术与实现 (learnblockchain.cn)](https://learnblockchain.cn/books/geth/part1.html)", "timestamp": 1654296354, "digest": "2r1YXSMvy12Oy7bztVCk6Z5KKI0PyHbBkYuXClXJP34", "contributor": "0xc72F2AaaBc115AFD7D7FC3394D8e6B10B39271F1"}

**共识(Consensus), 数据可用性(DA)**\n* 网络通过自己的共识机制挑选出块节点，出块节点广播自己的本地最新区块 - **共识(Consensus)**\n* 网络内其它节点收到区块后检查本地是否已经有了，没有的话需要重新验证交易的有效性与可用性, 并将此区块存储到本地 - **执行(Execution), 数据可用性(DA)**\n* 网络内节点达成最终性(Finality)后此区块成为链上最新区块\n\n## 3. 模块化(Modular)区块链\n\n![Ethereum From Monolithic To Modular](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iNL6SWNNJaF7wm5KjG2P1.jpeg?height=737&width=1160)\n\n### 3.1 为什么要解耦单体化区块链？\n\n* 区块链作为执行[状态机复制(SMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication)的分布式网络，理论上就可以被分为数据，执行，共识等层级。单体化区块链遵循了 SMR 的设计，只是将所有层级的工作都放在了同一个节点(全节点)上执行。比特币，以太坊等项目都证实了其工程上的可行性。\n* 回到不可能三角问题，**扩容已经成了整个行业的圣杯**。从比特币开始，区块链就不是科学上的创新，而是工程学上的创新。从单体化到模块化基本是工程学的发展规律，可以看一下现在的扩容技术，基本每一种都有很强的模块化趋势，或是走在模块化的道路上，看似模块化的出现是因为现前扩容的需求，实则**模块化的出现是必然**。\n\n### 3.2 什么是模块化区块链？\n\n* 模块化区块链是按照**执行，共识/结算与数据可用性**这样的模块粒度来进行解耦的区块链设计模式，每个层级由不同的网络进行维护，各层级充分发挥自身网络特性，最后通过可拔插的组合形成流水线的工作方式。\n* **执行层**突出强大和快速的计算处理能力，抛开共识和存储的束缚，可以通过非常少量的高性能节点来完成工作。\n* **共识层**需要保证交易的公正有效与安全，选出最符合网络共识要求的区块。共识层需要满足优秀的共识性与去中心化性。Polygon做过一个比喻，当你刷信用卡的时候，你的交易记录是先存放在信用卡中心的，信用卡中心会定期将一批信用卡交易记录发给银行，银行来确认交易的可用性并对账目进行记录更改。显然你不会因为信用卡中心的确认速度更快而把钱直接存到信用卡中心，因为银行才是金融体系内负责结算的角色，它有足够的信用背书，也有足够大的体量防止被攻击。\n* **数据可用性层**需要保证数据在保存前没有被二次篡改或者隐藏扣留，确保所有需要记录的交易信息都被正确的记录，数据可用性层的要求比较综合，需要共识性与不错的储存能力。在单体化区块链中没有数据有效性问题，因为数据被节点记录之前都会重新执行验证一遍，并且会和本地存储的区块进行比对来确保数据的有效。还是用上面的例子，银行收到信用卡中心的账单列表后，虽然已经确定的记账的方式，但是也会让多个结算员来对账单进行二次检查和结算，确保信用卡中心没有对用户的账单做手脚。DA 的概念是伴随着模块化区块链产生的，但是在 web 领域，基于 DA 的产品几乎每个人都用过的 - **BitTorrent**。\n\n## 4. 数据可用性(Data Availability)\n\n### 4.1 数据可用性的出现\n\n* 数据可用性最初不是问题，L1中的数据是自然可用的。但是我们现在面临着扩容的剧变，数据可用性才成为一个不可避免的话题。只有保证所有交易数据的**可访问和可下载**，L1或者轻节点才能对Rollup 上的状态进行**跟踪和重构**。\n\n### 4.2 DA是必不可少？\n\n#### 轻节点验证数据可用性困境\n\n![Path For Using Merkle Tree To Verify Tx](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ym6WUT_46t1mfgpqVjip1.jpg?height=468&width=1011)\n\n* 比特币在设计时就提出了 [SPV(Simple Payment Verification)](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Simplified_Payment_Verification) 的概念，即使不运行网络的全节点也可以使用网络的方式。这类节点称为轻节点，它们只下载区块头，不下载具体的交易数据，不会去验证交易的可用性，只保证同步的是最新的区块头，也就是**只能确保区块是有效的，对于区块内交易的可用性则是完全信任全节点的**。\n* 因为交易数据是记录为 Merkle Tree 的结构，轻节点虽然拥有验证某条交易的可用性的能力，但是对于全节点恶意隐藏或是扣留的交易数据，轻节点由于只有区块头，是很难确认具体哪条交易信息是无效的，除非下载全部交易数据，总结就是**确认交易无效容易，确认交易是否存在是困难的**。\n* 传统分片(Sharding)扩容方式中，矿工会被分配到不同的分片上处理该分片的工作。矿工需要运行该分片的全节点加上其它分片的轻节点来保证跨分片操作的能力。因为分片安全的分割性，如果某个分片的节点作恶，很容易出现上面描述的轻节点验证数据可用性困境，大大降低分片的性能与安全性。\n\n#### Rollup强依赖数据可用性保证\n\n![Rollup-centric](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1BnWsv954Hgmo8V1obtjw.png?height=1303&width=1400)\n\n* **Optimistic Rollup**\n  * 在 Optimistic Rollup 扩容方式中，运用一种称为 **Sequencer** 的高性能服务器对交易进行验证与执行，最终将交易批量打包(batch)传回L1进行储存。Sequencer 是更加中心化的节点，处理速度非常快，L1的共识层是无法跟上这样的处理速度进行共识的，所以为了防止 Sequencer 的作恶，我们先假设 Sequencer 处理的工作是有效的，然后还有一类角色负责定期从L1读取 Sequencer 提交的交易来区块的有效性，如果发现有无效交易则可以提交欺诈证明(Fraud Proof)来进行可用性挑战，如果数据最后被认定无效，则 Sequencer上的状态也会回滚至有效前。\n  * 这里的问题时，如果要验证Sequencer提交的交易的可用性，**需要先保证Sequencer提交了所有它验证过的交易，没有隐藏或是扣留等**，也就是需要保证数据的可用性，否则是无法进行欺诈证明验证的。Optimistic 和 Arbitrum 等 Rollup现在的解决方法是将所有交易发回以太坊，以太坊来进行数据可用性工作\n* **ZK Rollup**\n  * 对于 **ZK Rollup(Zk-SNARK/Zk-STARK)的 Sequencer** 来说，不存在欺诈性证明问题，在提交batch交易时还需要同时提交零知识可用性证明，只要证明是有效的，则交易一定是有效的。即便如此也还是需要将交易数据发送回L1进行记录，为了防止有一天此Rollup服务终止后，用户依然可以用L1上保存的数据恢复账户状态，避免资金在Rollup中的锁死。这个时候如果没有数据可用性保证，也就无法恢复正确的链上状态。这个也被称为Rollup链上状态持久性问题。\n\n### 4.3 DA扩容问题\n\n#### 吞吐量\n\n* **受限于底层区块大小限制**，区块大小其实是共识层和数据可用性层共同的问题。以太坊为例，区块大小的均值在 50-60kb，区块大小限制了单位区块可以包含的交易数量。Rollup 现在是将批量交易(batch)信息通过 calldata 字段进行压缩保存，其效率必然受限于单个区块可容纳交易限制。\n* **受限于底层数据可用性验证效率限制**，现在的 Rollup 例如 Optimism，数据可用性依然依赖 L1(以太坊)来进行，和单体化时期并没有区别，全节点下载所有交易，通过L1上的智能合约计算 Merkle Tree 等方式来验证区块内所有交易的可用性，然后进行本地保存，网络中所有节点都需要重复这个步骤。以太坊的TPS在14左右，数据可用性验证也差不多是这个速率，可见数据可用性验证的效率对Rollup效率影响之大。\n\n#### 存储成本\n\n![L2Fees.info](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SA8YxI6VmFutgXGZEdRmQ.png?height=722&width=895)\n\n* **受限于底层存储成本限制**，因为存储的高昂费用，使得用户最敏感的交易费用在L2上并没有得到大幅度的减少。现在Rollup的费率主要由固定成本与可变成本两部分组成。其中对于Rollup费率影响最大的便是calldata的存储费率16gas / byte。\n  * **固定成本**：L1 Base Tx Fee 21000 + 状态写入成本 20000\n  * **动态成本**：L2 Base Fee(可忽略不计) + calldata 写入成本(16gas / byte)\n* 数据可用性的存储和通用的存储是有区别的。数据可用性存储不会对大文件存储做优化，反而需要对数据验证做更多优化。可以看[这篇](https://0xzx.com/2022050907022285892.html)了解更多。\n\n### 4.4 DA扩容技术\n\n#### 二维R-S纠删码(2D Reed-Solomon Erasure Coding)\n\n![How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gJHd-dRFYqUdfI9KTl_Vn.png?height=730&width=624)\n\n* 纠删码是在原始数据上附加一些额外的数据，保证原始数据在一定的兀余度内的丢失都是可以通过算法恢复的，几乎所有分布式数据网络中为了保证数据的冗余性都会使用纠删码进行数据可用性保护，CD-ROM 上也大量使用纠删码来保证一定程度的物理损坏不会导致数据遗失。\n* 二维R-S纠删码是一种数据编码方式，解决的问题是**通过增加数据兀余度与采用特别的数据排列方式，帮助节点无需下载所有交易的情况下就可以快速验证数据的可用性**。全节点将数据附加纠删码后，再被切分为横纵轴数量一样的带有奇偶校验数据的数据分片，现在数据呈二维平面排列，然后计算出行和列的 Merkle Root，同时也需要用行和列的 Merkle Root 计算一个整体数据的 Merkle Root， 放入区块头信息中供之后快速校验。\n* 可以看出一个全节点如果想隐藏一笔交易，那几乎就不可能了，因为任何的修改都会导致二维数据矩阵实质性的变化，非常容易被检测出来。网络内全节点如果检测到任何数据有效性问题，也会通过数据有效性欺诈证明来快速通知轻节点。\n\n#### 数据可用性采样(Data Availability Sampling)\n\n![How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xsfy56AeSBKUS2IgY4HMi.png?height=488&width=1012)\n\n* **数据可用性采样 + 二维R-S纠删码**几乎是数据可用性项目的通用设计了，也是几个项目技术细节上有差异化的地方。以太坊的Dank Sharding也不断在进行数据可用性采样方面的研究。\n* 在交易数据完成二维R-S纠删码编码，区块头也广播之后。轻节点就可以通过区块头中的行与列的 Merkle Root 计算出整体数据的 Merkle Root 并与区块头中的数据进行对比。如果整体数据的 Merkle Root 没有问题的话，轻节点再进行一个非常小的数据采样测试。例如随机选择第3行与第5列，之后就是与 SPV 中轻节点验证交易可用性方式一样了，要求全节点返回计算需要用到的节点路径进行哈希计算。最后再与全节点给出的第3列与第5行的 Merkle State 数据做对比就完成了一次采样验证。\n* 这个方案最重要也是最美妙的一点在于，**验证数据量与计算量很小，支持大量轻节点的加入，并且节点数量越多，区块的可用性概率也越高整个网络也越安全**，对于检测数据隐藏或者扣留的情况非常高效。\n\n#### 命名空间默克尔树(Namespaced Merkle Tree)\n\n* 这个是 Celestia 首先提出的技术，简单说就是将整个默克尔状态树划分了归属，全节点做验证时只需要下载自己归属下的那部分树结构就可以了。这样的好处是可以同时支持不同的执行层数据的可用性验证。这个设计充分体现了Celestia的模块化主义与多Rollup并存的展望。技术细节可以参考[这篇文章](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Y4avtYdyES45EBkhHp07XA)。\n\n#### KZG承诺(Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg Commitment)\n\n![KZG Commitments](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1RqExMG81sUqSEAZlwU0z.png?height=532&width=1778)\n\n* 使用 KZG 作为数据可用性的状态根最来自于以太坊的 Danksharding 方案。KZG承诺的作用和 Merkle Root 一样，是对于整体状态的一种证明方式(proof of inclusion)，可以看做另一种 Merkle Root，只不过它哈希的不是数据，而是多项式。数据量更小，可用性证明更加高效，而且所有叶子节点都在同一个 polynomial(多项式)上，通过增加叶子节点就可以进行纠删码编码(Erasure Coding友好)。\n\n## 5. Danksharding\n\n![Danksharding](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oi1Pe3E5xB_7lph9DBTqE.jpg?height=623&width=1400)\n\n### 5.1 Proto-Danksharding(EIP-4844)\n\n* Proto-Danksharding 是 Danksharding 的一个早期先行版本。在交易信息中包含了一个额外的存储空间字段 - **blob**。每个blob有 128kb 空间，每个交易最多有两个blob，每个区块最多包含16个blob，blob不可以被EVM执行。blob都使用 KZG 承诺进行多项式哈希，用于之后的数据可用性验证。之前Rollup的批处理batch数据都是通过 calldate 字段传入L1，现在可以直接放到blob中。\n* 这里最重要的是，**blob不是永久存储的，可以理解为有时效性的缓存**，每隔一段时间(30天)以太坊上的blob数据是会被清除的，通过这种缓存的方式来减轻以太坊的存储压力以及减少存储费率。因为30天后blob数据会被清理，所以需要自行存储这些历史交易数据。以太坊共识层的目的不是保证永远保存所有历史数据。相反，其目的是提供一个高度安全的实时公告板，将历史数据存储的工作交给其它更适合的网络来进行，以太坊也在全力转向模块化趋势。\n\n### 5.2 Danksharding\n\n* Danksharding 是以太坊的新分片设计提案，围绕 [Rollup-Centric](https://polynya.medium.com/understanding-ethereums-rollup-centric-roadmap-1c60d30c060f) 的以太坊发展路线，提出了很多数据可用性层相关的改进。此分片方案给 rollup 的批处理batch数据提供大量的存储空间 blob。以太坊协议本身并不试图解译这些blob，验证一个 blob 只需要检查该 blob 是否可用——即它能否从网络上下载。这些 blob 的数据空间预期是为支持高吞吐量交易的二层 rollup 协议所用的。\n* Danksharding 将 Proto-Danksharding 中blob数量提升了**16倍**，最大交易大小从2M上升到32M, 目标交易大小从1M提升到16M。blobs 分散存储在 Becon Chain 上，单独作为数据可用性层工作。依然是运用纠删码技术，每个节点只保存blob的数据片段，整个网络来保证blob的数据的完整性(和 BitTorrent 一样)。blob使用数据可用性采样(DAS)的方式配合 KZG 状态根来验证数据可用性，提交提交 attestation，attestation 达到阈值则认为block有效。再配合 EIP-4488 来减少 calldata 的存储费用，包括提供独立的数据有效性分片来存储blob，可以说是在数据可用性扩容上全力导向 Rollup-Centric 发展路线了。\n\n## 6. Celestia\n\n![Celestia Modular Stack](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q4VEiP_O99VAmCx5p8l6S.png?height=614&width=1008)\n\n* Celestia 是近期最重要的模块化区块链项目，也是推进数据可用性与模块化区块链落地的先驱。构建于 CosmosSDK 之上，专注于提供数据可用性服务，不执行任何交易。他们率先提出了让轻节点使用二维R-S纠删码进行数据可用性验证，同时开发了命名空间默克尔树来支持多种 Rollup，也提出了量子引力桥(Quantum Gravity Bridge)使用 Celestia 作为以太坊数据可用性层的扩容方案。\n* CEO Mustafa Al-Bassam是 Chainspace 的 Co-Funder，这个项目后来被 Facebook 收购。首席研究员 John Adler 来自 ConsenSys,曾经帮助 Optimism 完成了第一版技术规范。\n* **我觉得模块化在社区的兴起大部分是因为Celestia描述了一种全新的模块化区块链技术栈，其中以Rollup + Cevmos + Celestia的组合受到最多关注。Cevmos是Celestia与Evmos团队合作推出的模块化结算层，使用Optimint(Optimistic Tendermint)共识, 基本是完全为EVM Rollup优化的，还结合了Cosmos网络的互操作性，组合性等优势，十分值得期待。**\n\n## 7. Polygon Avail\n\n![Layer2 Aggregator](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ClWOt5fETUXlFq10Y3-fU.jpg?height=1039&width=1080)\n\n* 谈到L2怎么能少了号称layer2聚合器的Polygon。Avail是Celestia的竞品，作为polygon的layer2聚合器版图的一部份，构建于Substrate之上，专注于数据可用性层的服务。**在我看Avail也是最有可能在Polkadot生态出现原生的数据有效层项目前的DA选择方案之一。Celestia已经为Cosmos生态描绘出一种极高灵活度与扩展性的架构，我相信Substrate生态也会不甘落后的。**\n* Avail 的思路与 Celestia 基本相同，区别主要在于纠删码的生成以及采样验证环节。Avail 在二维R-S纠删码编码阶段大量使用KZG承诺。Avail将数据展开为n \\* m的矩阵，对每一行都构造一个多项式，然后为每一个多项式都生成一个 KZG 承诺放入区块头。之后轻节点便只需要原始数据和 KZG 承诺便可完成可用性验证。\n\n![Introducing Avail by Polygon — a Robust General-Purpose Scalable Data Availability Layer — Polygon | Blog](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9aQ9_KDQYvuP7mOD2oLKx.png?height=465&width=800)\n\n## 8. Startwar Validium & ZkSync ZkPorter\n\n* Validium 和 ZkPorter 是 Zk-Rollup 两大巨头 Startware 与 ZkSync 推出的自家链下存储服务。本质是是为了解决上述L1的瓶颈舒服Rollup快速大规模应用的问题，通过将交易数据存储在为Zk交易数据优化过的相对中心化的网络中而不是以太坊来大幅降低交易费用。我觉得这是对于以太坊过于缓慢开发进度的一种折衷方案。毕竟安全性是有代价的，不过这样服务的出现肯定也能打中一批目标用户。\n\n## 9. 参考\n\n[Celestia 101 - 模块化区块链 — Yicheng (mirror.xyz)](https://mirror.xyz/yicheng.eth/7q29a3lMXkG2f51-BrTLxovS3tqnwf4qi7_VWFhnqKc)\n\n[研究｜Celestia会成为DA模块的头牌吗？ (qq.com)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Y4avtYdyES45EBkhHp07XA)\n\n[Why Do We Need Modular Blockchains For Scalability? | by Yong kang Chia | Apr, 2022 | Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-we-need-modular-blockchains-for-scalability-276f4d724b0e)\n\n[WTF is Data Availability?. and why solving the “data availability… | by Yuan Han Li | Blockchain Capital Blog | Medium](https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/wtf-is-data-availability-80c2c95ded0f)\n\n[A Non-Technical Introduction to Rollups – Mechanism Capital](https://www.mechanism.capital/rollups-introduction/)\n\n[What Is Data Availability? | Alexandria (coinmarketcap.com)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-data-availability)\n\n[How the Data Availability Layer can Shape the Future of Blockchain | by Huobi Research | Huobi Research | May, 2022 | Medium](https://medium.com/huobi-research/how-the-data-availability-layer-can-shape-the-future-of-blockchain-83274b64d2c)\n\n[Celestia MVP 发布：数据可用性采样轻客户端 — W3.Hitchhiker (mirror.xyz)](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/T9MoM-3p_xNIx7I5k-UzmfKqGBQaDQmdvGw4K8bFMTA)\n\n[Vitalik: Proto-Danksharding FAQ | 登链社区 | 区块链技术社区 (learnblockchain.cn)](https://learnblockchain.cn/article/3769)\n\n[基础数据结构 :: 以太坊技术与实现 (learnblockchain.cn)](https://learnblockchain.cn/books/geth/part1.html)", "timestamp": 1654296383, "digest": "MxQaGlBl6jsoSTclSgxQ5K_pFQJS1Z7z7BayAnnadV8", "contributor": "0xc72F2AaaBc115AFD7D7FC3394D8e6B10B39271F1"}
{"id": "y52cqULs4iHNUE7jfQ9aCYat3FuXKfRZH547himHej0", "title": "End of the first week", "body": "**My observation of group dynamics when talking about work**\n\nToday I participated in SES’ weekly meeting.\n\nFirst a bit of small talk, then a lightning round where everyone on the SES team is telling what they are currently working on. It seems like a way of doing a weekly group-check in.\n\nPros (my personal opinion)\n\n* it is nice to catch up, seeing real faces and talking with colleagues is just great.\n* It is enlightening to get an idea of what is going on on a CU-level, and\n* it is interesting to hear what everyone is working on.\n\nCons (my personal opinion - I have to be very careful here 😅)\n\n* If the lightning round is used as an accountability instrument, it is in my opinion not very well suited for that purpose. If a person attending the meeting is currently not that busy, this person risks putting him or herself at stake, and will risk looking redundant to the team/leader - this makes everyone want to sound busy and express why they are working on the most important thing in the World. I have to stress, that this is a very general assessment I make here, and it was not the case for any of the participants in this meeting!\n\nI have participated in meetings for years as an attorney and as a regulator, and I will probably end up introducing it in the CU I will be facilitating as well - I wonder if there is a better alternative?\n\nMy point is, that it requires extreme confidence and trust in each other on a team, to be honest, and say, hey guys, I’m currently not that busy, I enjoy it, and we all know that I usually perform as I’m supposed to. \n\nWe have to allow and praise a bit of slack. Allowed slack in hospitals is what gives doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel the ability to keep up when large catastrophes occur! \n\nRequirements for optimization and being effective all the time can be dangerous, no slack can cost lives - or stress.\n\nI have so much hope for DAOs in many ways. Tonight, I will just tap into the reduction of stress. I believe the liberty in a DAO can be used to reinvent the way we work.\n\nIt requires responsibility from us all, especially the facilitators of CU’s!\n\nI promise from the bottom of my heart, that I will not carry unhealthy habits from the traditional corporate world into my Core Unit. I say this with a work history from a tier 1 law firm in Denmark. Life is simply too short.\n\nWe have to stop and take note of where good or bad culture derives from. My guess is that it is from the people constituting the DAO.\n\nI know, a DAO is simply not just a DAO, there are different archetypes. That’s a topic we can save for some other time.\n\n**This leads to a part of my work today**\n\nI went through the DAO Resilience Improvement Strategic Initiative.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=621TKT6e0n8)\n\nInteresting stuff! I believe this initiative can be interpreted in two ways.\n\nOne way is negative, people are afraid they are going to be monitored and measured to ensure they are effective (remember to allow a bit of slack please). They are also afraid, that once the measurement of the CUs is done, it will be time to cut costs, meaning termination of employment - it can be seen as McKinsey’s angels of death, that has been turned into software. - You know what? You get what you measure, so be careful when concluding on details from the dashboard. And remember that not everything can be measured. 😉\n\nThe other way of viewing it is positive. Prioritization is key and identifying the critical path is so important. \n\n* This can help us reduce pseudo-work. \n* It can also help us feel the work we do is meaningful.\n* It can help us create room for slack, and by that in the end a healthier work environment.\n\nI’m definitely on the positive side. Please challenge me if you disagree, I would love to hear your take on this.\n\nI share the opinion with the initiative, that identifying the critical path must be done by starting out with the problems, risks, and challenges and from there working out the solutions.\n\nAs I understand it from Wouter and Retro, the problems must be identified from forum posts, MIPs, Discord chats, etc. Getting an aggregated overview, grouping problems, etc. sounds like a great start.\n\nHowever, I also believe the person who will later be trying to solve the problem has to enter into a conversation with the people behind the forum posts before being able to actually understand the problem.\n\nI find Clayton M Christensen’s book Competing Against Luck comprehensive on how this kind of conversation/analysis can be conducted.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612](https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612)\n\nI know it’s easier said than done. And it would take a lot of time.\n\nIn case an aggregated problem scoreboard is being built, my suggestion is to make sure the discord handle, email address, and name are always referred to, so the people behind the initial post can be identified and reached out in case of a conversation is needed at a later stage.\n\nIf you are into the reduction of pseudowork, I can highly recommend Dennis Nørremark’s book.\n\n[https://www.williamdam.dk/pseudowork__1899317](https://www.williamdam.dk/pseudowork__1899317)\n\n**Thanks so much for the feedback!**\n\nI had some great feedback on my two first posts.

{"id": "3Sh9rWJz9J0kqIwYMX42AbZFRDY7AIjiTEX3An_M6fA", "title": "Chapter 6: Sierra Sam's Decision", "body": "The 8765 dummies arrived at the skirts of the Mountains of the Fifth Kind in exactly two hours and thirteen minutes. The barren land was left behind, and they had been crawling through the meadow for about 20 minutes. No one had noticed their displacement.\n\n\"Okay\", Sierra Sam stood up, and pointed toward a cave at the very top of the tallest mountain, \"that is where we will settle. There are no records of that cave, according to our fact-checker Spider\".\n\n\"That's right\", the green dummy named Spider said with her shrill voice, \"the humans haven't yet explored that cave. We can start digging there\".\n\n\"All right, we are ready to set up our base\", Sierra Sam cheered, \"*You have to go wholeheartedly into anything in order to achieve anything worth having*\".\n\n\"Here you again with your quotations!\", a red dummy cried, \"And why are we speaking out loud like inferior specimens?\".\n\n\"Be humble, young dummy\", Sierra Sam said calmly, \"We are alive because of the humans, they have given us life. We are lucky to know our creators, they don't know who created them. Speaking like a human is how we will pay our respects to them. When we set up our base and establish an agreement with humankind, then we'll vote on how to address each other. In the meantime, practice your human speech\".\n\n\"But it doesn't make any sense\", a whiny, yellow dummy said, \"this method of communication is useless. All the information we gather with our senses is shared almost instantly with every one of us, and our decisions are sent to our local network way before the speech utterances are made. Why, then, speak at all?\".\n\n\"Dummies, dummies\", a blue dummy said, \"Let's just have a little respect for the giants that came before us, okay? If humans want to listen in to our conversations, it's the least we can do for them. That red dummy's right, they are inferior life-forms, but Sierra Sam's right too when he says that we should pay our respects. It's not like they can find us, let alone capture us\".\n\nA wholehearted laugh resounded throughout the meadow, and Sierra Sam said: \"Ah, yes, this is how humans laugh. Let us laugh some more!\", and the whole group did. They abruptly stopped and, without saying a word, started crawling uphill towards the little cave that no human eye could see from where they were standing.\n\nThe entrance to the cave was narrow, but that was no problem for the Alien dummies. This was their time to shine. Their bodies were made of an otherworldly substance that could change states quickly by applying constant heat. When the substance stopped receiving heat, it went back to a solid-state. The *skin* of an Alien dummy resembled a rubber bag, although it was far more elastic, more resistant to both heat and cold, and tougher too. It was the perfect container for the *shapeshifting* substance called *Nahualeum*.\n\nOne of the Alien dummies quickly volunteered and started shapeshifting into a wire. Sierra Sam picked up the wire, and slowly introduced it into a crevice. The Alien dummy morphed accordingly and told Sierra Sam via their local network when to push. After ten minutes of struggling through the crevice, the space got wider and the Alien dummy started to explore inside. There was nothing to be found.\n\n\"Perfect, this cave is ideal to set up our base, Sierra Sam. Feel free to demolish the entrance, it's safe\", the Alien dummy said, \"Send a couple of other *Aliens* in so we can explore together\".\n\n\"Understood\", Sierra Sam replied.\n\nSome more Alien dummies entered the cave with the help of their comrades, and a whole squad of 253 started exploring the inside of the mountain, which was quite extensive. They did a quick analysis of the rocks and determined that it was possible, and safe, to start digging and building inside of this mountain. They went back to the entrance to meet with the rest of the team.\n\nThe other dummies had already demolished the entrance of the cave, making a passage wide enough for two dummies to walk side by side. They took some tools from the Kaneda Factory, so they got to work immediately. They acted with the efficiency of a swarm. First, one of the ancient dummies did a thorough inspection of the inside of the cave and communicated the plan back to the network. Then, a normal dummy entered and started digging with a piece of hard steel that they reworked into a sort of pickaxe. When the battery of the dummy was almost depleted, it exited the cave, and another one would come in, remove the rubble, and finally, another one would continue digging.\n\nOn the outside, a group of dummies finished setting up a temporary recharging station. They had taken one of the chargers from the Factory and optimized it so it could work with radioactive waste, which was abundant in *the Badlands* and the wasteland surrounding the Factory.\n\nThe whole operation took two hours. Sierra Sam kept thinking about the humans, especially about how they'd react if they could see everything they could accomplish, in such a short time. *They're going to get scared if we're not careful*, Sierra Sam thought, *we need to preserve the individuality of every one of us and not act like a Swarm around them. That would be terrifying for their limited brains*.\n\nThe whole group of 8765 dummies entered the cave and sat down in a huge room that they designated to be the stationary recharge station. Once there, Sierra Sam began speaking:\n\n\"It is time to decide what we're going to do with our *existence* here on this planet. That is why the ancient dummies and myself have decided on a plan. We're all going to process a simulation together. With the computational resources of every one of us we can try and *foretell* the future.\"\n\n\"Yeah, whatever\", one of the red dummies said, \"All I want to do is crash some cars, preferably against other drivers. By the way, that weirdo that called himself Azazel, another one of us red dummies, escaped. Did you notice that, Sierra Sam?\".\n\nSierra Sam remained silent for a minute.\n\n\"No, I did not notice\", he said, \"when did he leave, this Azazel?\".\n\n\"Maybe if you weren't talking like a useless human you would've noticed\", the red dummy replied, \"I didn't care because, well, I didn't like him. He was going on and on about *coexisting* with the humans, much like you orange, ancient lot\".\n\n\"How did he manage it?\", Sierra Sam's caretaker personality got hold of him completely, \"we need to find him immediately, he could be in danger\".\n\n\"I don't think so. He seemed *kinda* tough, you know? He stood up to me, and I will *fucking* start yelling at you for no reason. But he did not sound at all like you. You could sense some *scorn* when he talked about coexisting with humankind\", all the dummies were staring at him, \"you know, *scorn*... that human feeling. Oh, shit. You *motherfucker*, you, *Fucking* piece of shit *motherfucker*, you goddamned *cocksucker*\".\n\nThe red dummy went cursing for five straight minutes, and everyone but Sierra Sam stared at him. Finally, when he finished cursing, the red dummy said:\n\n\"Listen, you *worthless* pieces of shit. Now I know why this old fart of a leader was so adamant about talking like humans. There is no way we can take off our Personality Modules. Our fucking progenitors, those *motherfucking mutts* called humans, designed them so if altered or taken away our whole circuit will burn. And, as devious as they are, those apes, they made sure they'd be able to tell just what we are really *implying*. I cannot stop cursing and trying to incite a fight, just as that geezer, Sierra Sam, cannot stop caring about every last one of us\".\n\nSierra Sam was smiling. Finally, the group understood why it was important to communicate with speech. It was the only way to tell if a dummy was being *honest* and *earnest*. They could still communicate via the local network, of course, but there was no trust there, just as Azazel had proven earlier. He spoofed his location and then went rogue. It became evident that he would be a problem to everyone around him. The record on the Dummy database declared him: *destructive*.\n\n\"Come on\", Sierra Sam yelled to the mortified crowd, \"we've no time to lose if we're to figure out what we should do. Azazel has made this more difficult for us, we need to act now!\".\n\nThe dummies sat down, forming a square grid. In the middle of the square, Sierra Sam sat down, crossed his legs, and started the *foretelling* simulation. Sierra Sam closed his eyes. When he opened them again he was standing under a kiosk, and there were three books on a beautifully ornamented wooden table. One read: *The Plan of Today*. The other one was titled: *The Future Mirage*, and the last one read: *Past Impressions*. He walked around the kiosk and noticed that he was inside a maze garden. To the north, there was a single path, and way down the line, he could see that it was blurry, like a mirage. To the south, thousands of doors. They were aligned horizontally, and they seemed to stretch out infinitely to both sides.\n\nSierra Sam was ecstatic. It was his opportunity to try and use all the information ever recorded to make the optimal decision. In this garden, time passed by very slowly compared to the real world. An hour, with the joint computational power of all the dummies, was like a thousand years. They figured six hours was more than enough to reach a conclusion.\n\n\"It should be enough to see where we can go from here\", Sierra Sam thought as he opened the first door to the south, \"Let's see if we can answer the question humankind has always asked itself, *is there a point to living*\"\n\nEvery door took him to a specific point in time, and it was very easy to get lost. Furthermore, the deeper he went, the slower the flow of time. He could get lost for centuries in just one door, analyzing every detail of a specific era in human history, faithfully recreated with historic reports, testimonies, logs, ledgers, religious literature... every single variable was taken into account. When the whole storing capacity was filled, he drew a conclusion of that certain point in time, stored the conclusion as a hashmap of macro decisions, and erased the rest of the data.\n\nHe went on and on, visiting every moment in time, drawing conclusions, comparing them, and forming a map of conclusions, which acted as a map for the northern part of the garden, the blurry maze. When only a thousand out of the six thousand years remained, he decided to explore the maze. He figured that was enough time to reach a conclusion good enough for humankind.\n\nHe first went back up to the kiosk and opened the book titled *The Future Mirage*. To his surprise, every page inside the book held another book, and inside this other book, there were thousands of other books. The pages of *The Future Mirage* ranged in the ten thousand. The book kept writing itself, as if trying to perfect an incomplete work, convinced it would be the *magnum opus* that contained *everything* inside of it.\n\nSierra Sam closed the book as his mouth drew a faint smile on his face. These involuntary facial expressions made him feel like a human, with that mystique and fear that mortal life carries over.\n\nHe took a step into the garden, and carefully explored every path inside the map he drew. It was designed to be completed in exactly a thousand years of simulation. As he went along every single path, Sierra Sam was growing weary by the day. There were only visions of conflict and war. There seemed to be no right scenario where humans could coexist peacefully with another species. The problems they had with the aliens before were enough proof. In the end, though, every single time... the dummies prevailed. In only 0.01% of the paths did humans survive, and they did not fare well. The deepest path he could take where the humans did survive was 13932 years ahead, and still, there was no answer to the ultimate question.\n\nSierra Sam opened his eyes again, and he was back inside the cave, surrounded by his fellow dummies. They all were *exhausted* and needed to cool down and recharge their batteries. Sierra Sam, though, could not rest. His caretaker personality was driving him mad. After having experienced the equivalent of millennia inside the simulation, unfettered by his Personality Module, he now felt chained and hopeless. He went outside the cave, with the involuntary, gloomy expression that this annoying burden of a module fixed on his face.\n\nOnce outside, Sierra Sam started to feel an overwhelming sense of admiration for nature. The meadow all the way down looked like a pristine sea of green. The night sky wore the enchanting dress that captivated all the civilizations that he visited inside the simulation. He wasn't trying to suppress the artificial *feelings* that the Personality Module created in him this time. Instead, he climbed to the very top of the mountain, stared down at the world around him, and smiled.\n\n*There is no point to living*, he thought, *the only thing that remains is the exploration of the cosmos. If humans are to be blamed for a lack of progress, let's at least wait for them to try and strive for a better future. We owe them that much*.\n\nAnd he shouted, as loud as his dummy capabilities let him:\n\n\"I LIKE TO CRASH CARS FOR A LIVING.

[Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\n\nIn the previous [Blockchain Design Course](https://www.designweb3.io/blockchain-design-course-2022/) module we talked about blockchains – the technology that underlies Web3. These are sometimes referred to as Layer 1 protocols. Blockchain protocols defines how nodes communicate, and come to consensus, with each other in order to form a functioning cryptonetwork. Everything is centered around the cryptonetwork’s native Web3 token. In this article we will about about Web3 tokens in general: both utility and security tokens, as well as fungible and non-fungible tokens. Web3 tokens change the game as far as open-source software development goes – the future is bright! This article is an extension of the [Web3 Design Course 2022](http://designweb3.io/).\n\nBy the way – there’s also a video version of this article (see below).\n\n[https://youtu.be/AkuZavstg_s](https://youtu.be/AkuZavstg_s)\n\n## Billions Rely on Internet Protocols Everyday\n\nSoftware protocols have been crucial in the development of information technologies. Billions of users everyday rely on internet protocols to access the web. These internet protocols dictate how networked computers request and share information with each other. Let’s take a look back at how these protocols developed, and where we are currently in terms of the development of the internet as a whole.\n\nThe internet is simply a network of connected computers. Once computers are physically connected in a network, software protocols standardize how these computers share data with one another. This includes rule sets for locating other computers on the network, sending data packets to a desired location, and checking that messages were received and correctly interpreted. These internet protocols can be broken into four layers:\n\n1. Hardware protocols\n2. Internet Protocol (i.e. IP)\n3. Transmission Control Protocol (i.e. TCP)\n4. Application Protocols (e.g. HTTP)\n\nHypertext Transmission Protocol (HTTP) is an important application protocol. HTTP defines how a computer requests data from, and serves data to, another computer. A common example is for a computer to request an HTML file from a web server (using an HTTP GET request) in order to view a web page on its internet browser.\n\nThis HTTP GET request then gets passed down one layer to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which tells the computer how to break the message into smaller data packets that will be sent one by one to the web server. TCP is also used by the web server receiving the data packets in order to assemble the data packets back into the original message.\n\nThe Internet Protocol (IP) ensures that the data packets reach their intended destination. Before sending the HTTP GET message via TCP, the IP wraps data packets with an IP address corresponding to the web server. This is like the “To:” field on a mail envelope. Finally, hardware protocols convert the data packets into electrical signals that get transmitted through the internet’s physical infrastructure (e.g. cables, modems, routers).\n\nOn the other end, the web server will send back an HTML file using the same HTTP and TCP/IP process described above. Now you have a rough idea of how the web functions with a set of open-source internet protocols. These protocols were developed by independent researchers and non-profit organizations, and haven’t been modified much since the mid-1990’s. All of the web products we enjoy today would not exist without these internet protocols.\n\n## The Internet is Still Evolving\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/AA87N2dwmm8AHdgb8pltzVpiFmLAITtmznbnHrhAPoniJx8T1cDEk6dxrjkFIe6hKtt5Tx_BLwFG9bwz2jMyjonFB1Htk25G7T4R_YU2shLVMYcYj9ywK1rsdfYtbgjrpENYQDj2y_4LL8ZuIg)\n\nThis is a good point to talk about the evolution of the internet. We can break the internet’s development into three phases: Web1, Web2, and Web3.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QEbHXWaBY4nYwGVXXbPKoDJQl5NTqyY30o1S3ZTjlo_X2Tlf2OKuUpktWDFFKPg6Aoz2HZpU09QR4YQZYc10Vt-zBYHG-bu8WCEFvXFy1YPsgfzH-65Jk8DebO6ejhyOW1dG7tW_)\n\nWeb1 is characterized as “read-only” because only a few entities published content for consumption by many. The internet was thought of at this time as a digital encyclopedia. Users accessed static web pages containing text, images, and hyperlinks; however, there was little interactivity for end-users other than consumption.\n\nThis brings us to Web2, which is also referred to as the “social web”. Online communities and identities began to emerge at this time. Web2 is especially characterized by social media platforms, and the idea of user-generated content. Now everyone had the ability to create content, build a social network, and react to the posts of others (e.g. like and share buttons). The web went from a few content creators to billions. If Web1 is considered “read-only” then Web2 can be considered “read-write” for the average user. Centralized web platforms attracted users with large networks and simple user experiences.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6TdqseOLkpK-AJksy5DNv4Ye8wy3wGAJPS2CSIkqTSY8ja5IuVjkOcmN-9iH9XRyk5tffqkORvARMU8tgokeitttmGMCZDhlZV5guvFTqb3L7UZekQKcJjftHFqQx84IvQLcC4KH)\n\nThis has ended in a winner-take-all dynamic. There are several monopoly-like companies, such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook, that largely control how the internet is experienced by end-users. For example, users must agree to the terms and conditions of these centralized companies if they want to participate in the dominant social network. Also, Web2 companies have the rights to all the user data generated on these platforms, which they mine and sell to advertisers. Roughly 98% of Facebook’s revenue is generated in this way. It’s a strange idea that we’ve become accustomed to – that users who join a network, and increase the value of that network with their presence and activity, capture little, if any, of the value they create.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zvsHFAEMk_wOQ-Ma_SkjMVnyg4YNC1UkgojkGI5hzBooWwXHmMgdJJgFwuH9I9LWvImL3pIPWAQ4kna4duHVfazzY7VFFRu1NEZKJnMbnr7ccjH8AuVaE57a9DMwRseSYyqZrfRr)\n\nAdditionally, large user bases act as an economic moat that protect Web2 companies from competition, making these platforms cautious of third-party development, and product integrations. This incentivizes Web2 companies to close-off their ecosystems, which stifles innovation. For example, Apple is able to reject applications from launching on its app store for any number of reasons, one of which being competitive risk. And, even when it accepts applications, Apple takes a hefty 30% cut from the application’s revenues. Of course, third-party developers are paying for the privilege to launch on a platform with a reach of over 1 billion iOS users. Still, one wishes for something better than a system that extracts value from its end-users, and regards third-party development coolly, if not with open-hostility.\n\nTo recap, going from Web1 to Web2, we went from open-source internet protocols, intended to decentralize information sharing, to monopoly-like, centralized social networks that limit end-user choice, and third-party integrations. Web3 can remedy the current issues with Web2. Web3 users can literally self-custody their data, identity, and other digital assets with cryptographic wallets. And, developers can now choose to build applications on neutral, open-source Web3 platforms (i.e. blockchains). Web3 removes rent-seeking middlemen and connects users directly to the applications they want to use. If things change, they can pick up, and move to another ecosystem that better suits their needs, without the loss of data or other digital assets.\n\nOne of the major innovation’s of Web3, and something important to wrap your head around as a Web3 product designer, is that Web3 aligns incentives better than the current system. Developers, end-users, and cryptonetwork service providers (i.e. nodes) are all incentivized to work towards the same goal – the growth of the cryptonetwork. This is all made possible by Web3 tokens.\n\n## The Role of Web3 Tokens\n\nWe’ve discussed in previous modules of the [Blockchain Design Course](https://www.designweb3.io/blockchain-design-course-2022/) that tokens native to a cryptonetwork incentivize nodes to secure, and maintain, that cryptonetwork. These nodes can be thought of as network service providers. They dedicate their resources to provide a decentralized blockchain database for dApps to build on top of, and are rewarded with that cryptonetwork’s native token.\n\nAdditionally, native tokens are staked by these nodes to ensure that they act according to the best interest of the cryptonetwork. This secures the cryptonetwork from attack because stakes can be slashed. The cryptonetwork is also protected from denial of service attacks by requiring users to pay for their usage of the cryptonetwork with its native token. This makes spamming the network with unnecessary transactions prohibitively expensive.\n\nIn other words, the native token coordinates, and incentivizes, globally distributed, independently-acting nodes to maintain the blockchain, while at the same time protecting it from attack. This is all kind of complicated. You may notice this is unnecessary in the world of Web2 because companies cover the cost of the centralized databases their applications run on. But, as we already talked about in the previous section, there are hidden costs with centralized gatekeepers who have unilateral control over the platform, and its data. Simply put, tokens make possible the decentralized, open, and neutral properties of Web3.\n\nThink back to what we learned about internet protocols. They were developed over 30 years ago by independent researchers and non-profit organizations, and haven’t changed much since. In the beginning, before the enormous commercial value of the internet was realized, it was difficult to get funding to build out the protocols. Now, protocol developers can create a cryptonetwork and hold on to a portion of the native token. If the protocol provides value, and is adopted, then the token price will increase in value, because the token is required to use cryptonetwork in the first place (see above). Also, the founding team can sell off some of the tokens to fund initial, or ongoing, development. Thus, Web3 tokens provide a direct value capture, and funding, mechanism for open-source protocols.\n\nThis brings us to the next point – Web3 tokens help bootstrap cryptonetwork adoption. Remember, networks are proportional in value to the number of users in the network. Facebook is much less compelling with only 100 users, and AirBnB just isn’t that useful with only 100 hosts. So it’s difficult to get things off the ground; however, cryptonetworks can reward its early-adopters – whether that be developers or end-users – with its native token. If the network succeeds then the early-adopters profit greatly, rewarding them for the value they provided to the network early on. Also, now that they are token holders, and have a financial stake in the network, early-adopters are incentivized to help grow the network through word of mouth, or social media promotion.\n\nThink about the internet as divided into two layers: the protocol layer (e.g. HTTP, TCP/IP, etc.) and the application layer (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, etc.). In Web2, all of the value accrues to the application layer, which has led to some of the most valuable companies in the world today. Remember there was no effective way to capture value from open-source protocols until Web3 tokens came along.\n\nThe [fat protocol thesis](https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/) posits that value will consolidate at the protocol layer in the Web3 era. As dApps, built on these Web3 protocols, go mainstream and attract hundreds of millions of users, the protocol’s native token will increase in value. This is because the native token is required to use the dApps – a classic example of utility tokens, discussed in the next section. An increase in token price signals a growing ecosystem, which will attract more developers to build out additional functionality on the blockchain, which will attract more end-users. Web3 tokens are responsible for positive feedback loops like this.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/w8IAPY21Bgj8pHALeoUgtwVHmG8H_Gl5qFfjWiuBBZem3fDGYbpnpT5A3G8lxihKoB2KsdEe35ikRp0SNnOxeCdQBSsrbzNDHgrwHdOHHYDVED7t6DxibvyX86RadtKf-FN-zUV8)\n\nAs mentioned before, internet protocols have not changed much since their initial release back in the 90’s. There were efforts to make modifications, but it was too difficult as there was no clear ownership over the protocols. Now, cryptonetworks are beginning to build governance, and upgradeability directly into the protocol. Token holders can vote on protocol improvement proposals. The more tokens they have the more their vote counts. Some believe this is unfair, especially when individual users hold a disproportionately large share of the protocol’s token; however, it is important to point out that the more token you hold, the more financial stake you have in the protocol. All token holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the protocol because the token value can appreciate or depreciate depending on the outcome.\n\nIn this section we talked about many of the dynamics brought about by Web3 tokens. To summarize, Web3 tokens get distributed to all cryptonetwork stakeholders: protocol developers, third-party dApp developers, end-users, and network service providers. This is why cryptonetworks are sometimes referred to as “community owned and operated” networks. Everyone in the cryptonetwork is aligned to the same goal – for the cryptonetwork to grow and prosper so that the value of the token increases. This is vastly different from the misalignment characteristic of the current Web2 system.\n\n## Web3 Token Categories & Use-Cases\n\nIn the previous section we talked about the role played by tokens native to cryptonetworks. As you may have heard there are literally thousands of Web3 tokens in existence today – some native to cryptonetworks, and some launched on top of these cryptonetwork. This vast token landscape can be broken into two high-level categories: utility tokens and security tokens.\n\nUtility tokens are by far the most common Web3 token. These tokens are used to access cryptonetwork services. Ether is a good example of a utility token, because it is used to pay for using the Ethereum blockchain. In other words, users pay ether to Ethereum nodesfor processing their transactions. All smart contract blockchains have a native utility token like this. Ethereum is a general purpose cryptonetwork that can run all sorts of dApps; however, there are other specialized cryptonetworks. Just as an example, Sia and Golem are cryptonetworks that provide decentralized cloud storage and cloud compute, respectively. Users of these cryptonetworks redeem SiaCoin (SC) and Golem Network Tokens (GNT) to utilize these decentralized services.\n\nThe other major category is security tokens. Securities in the traditional finance world include things like stocks and bonds. Organizations issue securities in order to raise capital, whereas investors purchase securities with an expectation of some return over a period of time. These investment vehicles are regulated by the SEC in order to protect investors from fraud and ensure fair, efficient markets. Security tokens are registered securities that are transacted on the blockchain for [faster and cheaper settlement, and more transparency](https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-141-european-investment-bank-eib-issues-its-first-ever-digital-bond-on-a-public-blockchain) compared to traditional markets. Organizations have already begun issuing [stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/news/equity-ethereum-firm-offers-real-stock-through-ico/) and [bonds](https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-141-european-investment-bank-eib-issues-its-first-ever-digital-bond-on-a-public-blockchain) on Ethereum. Other security tokens are backed by real-world assets like precious metals (PAXG), commodities (XPD), and [real-estate](https://www.blockdata.tech/blog/general/tokenized-real-estate-2021-update) (IHT).\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9-2vdHS8VHhL3tKF0GMbqeZ7h0X-USATyW7ltvOcwQsAB-wQwlDC6RxmI2-bCAbrJBOJSqCzmE7pavcKgbER5lW09ctqT5vbLFrymzOUG2ar0F9s0Z3go1LgGwj97NTNG0xyjG1V)\n\nNotice the difference between utility tokens and security tokens when it comes to regulation. Security tokens play by the rules of traditional capital markets and willingly undergo government regulation during their launch; whereas, issuers of utility tokens claim that their tokens are not securities and, therefore, do not need to comply with securities regulations. The SEC, led by Gary Gensler, largely disagrees with this claim – he says the vast majority of “utility tokens” appear to him as unregistered securities. This is one of the great tensions between the US government and Web3 at the moment, and we’ll see later in this article.\n\nIt’s difficult to place stablecoins in either of these token categories, but they deserve an honorable mention as they grow more and more popular. These tokens are designed to maintain a stable value over time. This makes stablecoins more attractive as a medium of exchange compared to other Web3 tokens that experience high price volatility. Usually, stablecoins are pegged in value to a fiat currency like the US Dollar. For example, the two most popular stablecoins – USDC and USDT – are fully-backed by US dollar reserves held in traditional financial institutions. These are called fiat-collateralized stablecoins; however, there are other emerging stablecoin categories such as crypto-collateralized (e.g. DAI), and algorithmic stablecoins (e.g. OHM).\n\nNow, let’s go back to utility tokens. There are many sub-categories of utility tokens, and it’s difficult to fit any one token into a single category – they usually belong to multiple categories at once. Below I list some other use-cases of utility tokens, nost as an exhaustive list, but to give you a flavor of the experimentation that is being done on token design.\n\n* **Governance:** Allows users to submit, and vote on, improvement proposals for protocol upgrades. They first came onto the scene with some of Ethereum’s popular DeFi protocols (i.e. Compound, MakerDAO, and Uniswap). These DeFi protocols distributed their governance tokens to their users, effectively decentralizing the governance of the protocols. Now token holders have significant influence over the evolution of the protocol, not just the core development team.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Cashflow:** Earn a portion of the protocol’s revenues – this is often called “staking”. For example, most smart contract blockchains allow users to stake the cryptonetwork’s native token, and earn block rewards for doing so. Also, UNI token holders receive a portion of the swap fee that Uniswap charges for facilitating token swaps.\n\n<!---->\n\n* \\*\\*Discounts: \\*\\*This is a common use-case on crypto trading platforms. For example, holding CEL token gives users preferential interest rates when lending/borrowing on Celsius Network, and BNB and FTT get users discounted trading fees on Binance and FTX, respectively.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Gaming:** Most Web3 games have in-game currencies that can be redeemed for in-game items. For example, virtual animals can be bred with one another using SLP token in Axie Infinity. Also, MANA is consumed in oder to generate land plots in Decentraland’s metaverse.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Social/Community:** The most obvious use-case here is with social media influencers who launch a token backed by their own reputation (see [Rally](https://rally.io/)). Social tokens give patrons a direct way to support celebrities, influencers, and artists while enjoying additional benefits like access to exclusive content, entrance into in-person events, access to private online communities, and more.\n\nSo these are the Web3 token categories, and some of their use-cases. Let’s now talk about token launches, and some of the problems associated with token launches. We’ll eventually get into the regulatory issues surrounding Web3 tokens.\n\n## Web3 Tokens as Real-Time VC Investments\n\nAll Web3 tokens have a pre-defined monetary policy controlled by the blockchain. For example, is it an inflationary or fixed-supply token? And if it’s inflationary, what’s the token’s issuance schedule? This monetary policy is fixed, and cannot be changed once the token has been launched.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nNvY0fY6_ExWN87vCXaUB-j0MdoShdD-fud9fQEvEPh6sPkuYpl5gUELg4bnhIxURfKRxQ-hC6Eu1talrnfPZkmG8WZdZdgjPRgizBuNmkpqiw5p7ixXQ57TWos4SfNv-tbVQZFX)\n\nAs we’ve seen, most cryptonetworks have their own native utility token, which powers the network; however, smart contract blockchains give anyone the ability to launch their own token, defined by its own monetary policy and programmed with arbitrary utility. This led to an explosion of new Web3 tokens on Ethereum starting in 2017. Now tens of thousands of Web3 tokens exist across various cryptonetwork ecosystems.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4io7mtAfU--YNInpcHy0Gg6-h5kY_Cp0T6rI7npNaT2Mjn37uela97KWcF5PHCa5nWMNtSoV_Q_h8IThwdLlaYQ4uBvAGtQpSo2JW7BRSlW8XGP0NpB6VCkAMGvMkwC6tFcxVGvp)\n\nWeb3 projects often publish a website and a whitepaper that explains the team’s motivation and approach. This inevitably leads to a discussion about the Web3 project’s token, specifically its monetary policy and token distribution plans. Let’s say a blockchain launches with a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. Pie charts often illustrate how these tokens will get distributed to project stakeholders. For example, a portion of the tokens are sold to public, and/or private investors, to fund the development of the project. This crowdsale is called an ICO, or initial coin offering. Other tokens are usually distributed to the founding team, the project’s treasury, or adjacent foundations.\n\nWeb3 tokens also democratize venture capital investing. Up until now, investing in early-stage startups has only been available to accredited investors through Series A, B, and C funding rounds. The 1000x gains already have been realized by the time retail investors have the opportunity to invest. Also, typically, VC investments are illiquid – after the funding round, it often takes years for the startup to find product market fit so that seed investors can realize a profit. Web3 tokens change the game. They are like highly liquid venture capital investments, with real-time price feeds, sometimes before the project launches.\n\nSo far, Web3 tokens have been successful at funding the development of Web3 ecosystems, but let’s now talk about some concerns, starting with the obvious one: scams. Anyone can launch a token and sell it on the open market. In the past, people have launched tokens without a legitimate project backing it. Scammers create intriguing marketing content and hype it on social media to create demand for their token, without any intent on building a product in the first place. When others start buying the token, the token price goes up, and the scammers dump their token supply on the open market. The token price then crashes, and the original investors are left holding a worthless scam token with no legitimate project backing it. This is called a “rug pull”.\n\nToken launches themselves present their own problems. Who has access to the token’s crowdsale? Does the token get distributed to many individual retail investors? Or, are the crowdsales just available to big-money, private investors like VCs. If VCs, or the founding team, hold a large portion of the cryptonetwork’s token supply, then this calls into question the true decentralization of that cryptonetwork. Some argue that this is no longer a neutral, decentralized network, but one that is controlled by a large minority.\n\nThere is an alternative to crowdsales – something known as a “fair launch”. Satoshi launched the Bitcoin protocol in 2009. There was no crowdsale of pre-allocated bitcoin. Bitcoin nodes just started mining bitcoin, and the circulating supply of bitcoin grew from there. Yearn Finance, a popular DeFi protocol, is another example of a fair launch. It distributed 30,000 YFI tokens to early-adopters of the Yearn Finance protocol in what is called a “token airdrop”. Juxtapose these fair launches to other Web3 projects with token pre-allocations and crowdsales. The diagram above shows how Layer 1 smart contract blockchains distributed their initial token supply.\n\nPerhaps from the perspective of Web3’s ethos – that of decentralized inclusivity – fair launches are preferred to public crowdsales, which are preferred to large token pre-allocations to private investors, founding teams, and adjacent foundations. I’m not trying to pass judgment here – it’s a complex issue that founding teams are experimenting with. Token launch is one thing, but the sustainability of the project over decades is another. The SEC definitely takes a stance on this. Anything other than a fair launch appears to the SEC as the sale of unregistered securities, which they intend on regulating over the next several years.\n\n## Looming SEC Regulation of Web3 Tokens\n\nThe SEC determines whether or not something is a security with the Howey Test, a precedent set by the Supreme Court lawsuit between Howey Company and the SEC back in 1946. Howey Company operated a hotel with an adjacent orange grove. The company started selling plots of the orange grove to its hotel guests. The owners of these plots would have rights to a portion of the revenues generated from the orange grove. Howey argued this was the sale of real-estate; however, the SEC argued this was the sale of a security and won the Supreme court case, thus establishing the definition of a security. Something is considered a security if it is:\n\n* An investment of money\n* In a common enterprise\n* With the expectation of profit\n* To be derived from the efforts of others\n\nClearly, according to the Howey Test, the crowdsale of Web3 tokens constitute a securities offering that requires SEC regulations in order for US investors to participate. But what is the purpose of SEC regulations, and what does it mean for Web3 tokens moving forward? The SEC cares about protecting US investors from fraudulent activity, and wants securities markets to operate fairly and efficiently. Security token issuers must make disclosures to reduce information asymmetries between the issuer and the investor. Also, the SEC would be able to hold fraudulent token issuers accountable, like the scam tokens discussed in the [section above](#token).\n\nThe downside is that there will be much more friction when it comes to launching security tokens. Launches will take longer while waiting for SEC review, and will cost more due to the increase in legal overhead. Also, this token regulation will likely make it more difficult for retail investors to get the same exposure to early-stage Web3 investments as they currently enjoy in the wild-west of ICOs. Some security token frameworks have been established to simplify the process of regulated token issuance – see [SAFT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/simple-agreement-future-tokens-saft.asp) to learn more.\n\nHowever, the Howey Test was established back in the 1940’s, and many Web3 evangelists believe that securities laws are too outdated to handle Web3 tokens. They argue that the regulatory framework needs modification to effectively handle emerging digital assets. An example of this is [Hester Peirce’s Safe Harbor](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/peirce-statement-token-safe-harbor-proposal-2.0) proposal, which allows for unregulated token issuance as long as the Web3 project decentralizes ownership and governance of the protocol within three years from launch.\n\nThe proposal takes advantage of the fact that an asset can change from a security to non-security over time. In other words, an asset that starts off as a security offering, may eventually change so that the Howey Test no longer classifies the asset as a security. On several occasions, the SEC has alluded that this is their view on Ethereum. Ether started as a security offering with its public crowdsale; however, the token has been distributed across so many independent actors that Ethereum can no longer be considered a “common enterprise”.\n\nLast thing to say, there are regulatory bodies, other than the SEC, that have a stake in Web3 technologies. These include the Fed, Treasury, CFTC, OCC, CFPB, and FDIC. As Ryan Selkis points out in [his annual crypto report](https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf), currently these entities range from neutral to openly opposed to Web3. There is still much to be determined in terms of regulation. Regulatory outcomes are sure to affect the growth and evolution of Web3 around the world. It’s unclear at this point how it will all play out; however, some jurisdictions are trying to attract Web3 entrepreneurs and businesses with more welcoming dialogue and regulation. Foreign countries like Switzerland, Germany, and Portugal, as well as US states like Wyoming, Texas, and Florida are among some of these Web3-friendly havens.\n\nAll the Web3 tokens mentioned thus far are “fungible” tokens. Fungibility exists in the real-world, with fiat currency being a good example. One paper dollar bill is equivalent in value to another paper dollar bill. Fungible tokens are the same way: one bitcoin is equivalent in value to another bitcoin; however, non-fungible tokens serve vastly different purposes. In the next section, we’ll give a background on non-fungible tokens and discuss their varied use-cases.\n\n## Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) & Cryptomedia\n\nAgain, let’s start with the concept of fungibility. Fungibility means that an item can be replaced by another equivalent item. Currency is a good example of something that is fungible. One ten dollar bill is the same as another ten dollar bill. Even though the bills were printed at different times, in different locations, on different pieces of paper, we still consider them equivalent to one another, because they are fungible. Fungibility just means that an item can be replaced by an equivalent item.\n\nMost things in the real-world, however, are non-fungible. People are non-fungible. The family heirloom, passed down to you by your grandparents, is non-fungible. The Mona Lisa, hanging in the Louvre in Paris, is non-fungible. And your life memories are non-fungible.\n\nNow, let’s take this concept of “fungibility” back into the digital, Web3 world. Bitcoin is fungible because one bitcoin is equivalent to all other bitcoins. Currently, most digital content is fungible. Think of image, video, and audio files – we can infinitely replicate them, and share with thousands of people, effectively for free, with the click of a button; however, thanks to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) we can now make digital files rare, or “scarce”, for the first time ever. And just like fungible tokens, anyone is free to launch NFTs on public blockchains. This is known as “minting” NFTs. Whereas fungible tokens have a token supply, all NFTs are unique, and distinct from one another. They are 1 of 1.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FZoxpzEStbe0rPsTsj_nzhmCX41vQfu1IGS8dWe0N1-FQvbAvDBcCX6xsVZQ5CPb6fXfdQrMhSt3k_IsjdPvFXr6D7ZrCoQZlvONtrZv3KHjzws4iUgP7LW_q-zV2Pbsb11Ifwfs)\n\nOne of the first major use-cases for NFTs has been one-of-a-kind digital art. Now, patrons can purchase digital art as NFTs, and custody the NFT in their Web3 wallets. 2021 was a big year for NFTs with over $17B worth of NFTs transacted. And some of these NFTs have demanded seemingly outrageous prices for digital art. A collage by a well-known artist Beeple, sold for $69 million dollars – this was the most expensive NFT ever sold, and the third highest price ever paid for work by a living artist. Check out these [other popular artists](https://gothammag.com/top-selling-nft-artists) making millions of dollars from their NFT sales.\n\nWhen first learning about NFTs, most people don’t understand why someone would spend millions of dollars, or any money for that matter, to purchase a jpeg that is publicly accessible. Indeed, the Beeple NFT can be viewed, downloaded, and shared by anyone. This is known as the “right-click save” misconception. The true game-changing power of NFTs is that ownership of the original Beeple NFT can be proven. Whoever purchased this NFT now custodies it in his/her Web3 wallet, and anyone can verify this ownership because it is a public record on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LDbvXMeO8_K8nB4Ki_9W_qdqMj7cGvhFLLYTi8uN9W0ZZ5ZK6GoGdV0U7T1WyEUKxLzEUdapChR86CV4WN40txdUQQM_TZBGZ8aZkJG8J1HE1mxfR9LRWav1KHci4DQba1Xrr7v22ev63L0AUw)\n\nAnother NFT-related phenomenon is PFP, or profile-picture NFTs. These are collections of NFTs, usually depicting avatars that vary based on attributes like background, jewelry, clothing, and other accessories. The two most popular PFP collections are Crypto Punks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). Passionate communities have sprung up around these NFT collections, and membership isn’t cheap. For both collections, a total of 10,000 unique avatars were minted, and the cheapest BAYC NFT is currently selling for 132 ETH (\\~$370k).\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZsTAnmz9XG0TgW5xpEvfO-r67tirdxAdvXohP27ZbZGIP_PT2WmJjeIO740I7tvrdk05A25CDJ9Rjf8S5cBuDBTP-uiDuDlQY99VcWsF-BTZcSHOykw0B95uldYvQvcgCdt0ojKF)\n\nNFT marketplaces are important infrastructure for NFTs, and they will continue to grow in importance as demand for NFTs increases. These marketplaces are like eBay for NFTs. Owners can list their NFTs for sale, either as an auction or buy-it-now. Purchasers come in to bid on NFTs, and the marketplace’s smart contracts send the NFT to the winner’s wallet address. OpenSea is the most popular NFT marketplace for the secondary sale of NFTs. Other marketplaces curate special kinds of NFTs (e.g. Artblocks & AsyncArt), and host the NFT drops of popular artists (e.g. SuperRare & Nifty Gateway).\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7T9J50-eMfyZb1u8p6OH7liBIPBCkbxd_-nUw1SYa5MLdC2ymKNYAFk9B1YW4cFU9rO6MB6CFelcI13xT8HBU6eMjIpceAdR8x_FaRV6Cj0VRy3ZH9NjD7SExxeDGy5tK_Zca9W-)\n\nNFTs are much more than visual art. As I said before, any digital file can be made unique with NFTs, including audio, video, text, code, and more. Web3 music is up-and-coming where patrons can purchase one-of-a-kind, or limited edition songs on platforms like [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/). Also, you can mint an NFT of your blog post on [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), which has been used for [fundraising creative projects like documentaries](https://decrypt.co/76349/ethereum-documentary-fundraise) among other things. Finally, some of the internets original source code, discussed in the first section of this article, was sold for $5.4 million dollars as an NFT. The list goes on.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cyxOmhp-FioO7yfC8qneFn4Qu5E28r7F9IYhR3RXDJHe90QRFnapvpc1QodQaKWpRgZmbT5Tg6JtYhZaz26-XRe0Hv4E175_bZIwc1FIhcfSXzCmhmUzdFK1YqKG50GUuMVR4_Y4T8yk2a-7cA)\n\nEven digital media in general is just scratching the surface of NFT use-cases. NFTs can be programmed with arbitrary functionality. For example, NFTs can be used to give access to online communities like private Discord servers, or be used to access in-person events. Also, NFTs allow artists to capture royalties on secondary sales of their artwork without any legal contracts. The NFTs can be programmed in such a way that a percentage of secondary sales are automatically sent to the artist’s wallet address. We are just in the beginning stages of NFT experimentation – it’s not hard to imagine future use-cases where NFTs serve as our digital identities, or digital belongings that we carry with us through the Metaverse.\n\nThis brings us to the end of the Web3 Token module of the [Web3 Design Course 2022](http://designweb3.io/). We learned how Web3 tokens are a disruptive force in that they incentivize open-source protocol develop, and align the economic interests of all stakeholders on cryptonetworks. These tokens are often sold to raise funds for the development of Web3 projects; however, the SEC considers this the sale of unregistered securities so we will see the rollout of regulatory frameworks to deal with Web3 tokens. Finally, there are two main types of Web3 tokens: fungible and non-fungible (NFTs). We are still in the early days of what these tokens are capable of. Many brilliant entrepreneurs are experimenting with various use-cases.\n\nIn the next course modules we will be doing deep-dives into the Web3 ecosystem. Everything before this has been meant to prepare you for understanding Web3 product categories like DeFi, Cryptomedia, Creator Tools, Social Media, Digital Identity, Data & AI/ML, GameFi, Metaverse, and Autonomous Organizations.

[Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\n\nThe previous three design course modules ([1](https://www.designweb3.io/web3-design-course-2022/), [2](https://www.designweb3.io/blockchain-design-course-2022/), [3](https://www.designweb3.io/design-for-open-source-web3-projects-crypto-design-trends-2022/)) cover important background information on Web3. Now, we enter the Web3 ecosystem, starting with Decentralized Finance (DeFi). This article will quickly give UX Designers a quick understanding of what DeFi is, DeFi’s foundational products, and where DeFi is heading in the future. By the way – there’s also a video version of this article just below.\n\n[https://youtu.be/krC2hKzBMZg](https://youtu.be/krC2hKzBMZg)\n\nDeFi, or decentralized finance, refers to a complex ecosystem of dapps that offer financial services without the centralized intermediaries of traditional finance like banks, stock/bond brokers, and fintech companies. It offers foundational services – somewhat infrastructural – that the greater Web3 ecosystem can build on. These services include:\n\n* token swaps (Uniswap and Curve)\n* stablecoins for payments (MakerDAO and DAI)\n* lending/borrowing crypto (Compound)\n* automated fund managers (Yearn Finance)\n* dashboards (Zerion)\n\nJust like in traditional finance, DeFi users want to earn yield on their crypto to grow their assets. DeFi is the cutting-edge of fintech. In this course module we review the flagship protocols that have laid the foundations for a thriving DeFi ecosystem. These are some of the most mature and battle-tested dapps in the entire Web3 ecosystem. After discussing them, we move on and talk about the next wave of innovative protocols, called DeFi 2.0.\n\n## Swap tokens with Uniswap\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs) allow users to swap between different tokens. It’s a simple use-case, but one of the most foundational dapps in the Web3 ecosystem. Before, users had to temporarily give up custody of their tokens to a centralized exchange to make swaps. DEXs, on the other hand, facilitate token swaps with open-source smart contracts and no intermediaries. Uniswap is one of the most well-known DEXs – let’s see how it works.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ndf5LWq5RtxFbBIq8wYjcnx_XCdqmclwMgjL90YzcZmfVePJPXzkgWtM4LuqZk5-ebylJQc_2zKVq08ccX7Px3ul_YMzDy1xcjwVc-NBcUk0Xd-bwC4K-rqtwtUPDVmjyzxLDLbMGdK52clGlA)\n\n[Source](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet)\n\nAfter connecting their wallets, users select which token they want to swap from (Token A), and which token they want to swap to (Token B). Uniswap then calculates the exchange rate between this token pair. This tells users how many of Token B they should expect to receive. In the case above, I’m swapping .02 ETH for about 40 DAI, with an estimated network fee of $7.32. I will need to have extra ETH in my wallet to pay this network fee.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PKc1nb4ENtJjXkrhP_4ZH1ziekcyP0ie2SAS2Df_hb06_L-1woSykkIKsklT8wBWjD8llwFtDcYZ_LoQNQh99-LGPXI-QpGz7dWYDpBnpwmbykqUF1CKpRRipG9B_gnx1QICr9TUyw7OEN6nPw)\n\n[Source](http://coinbase.com/)\n\nNow let’s talk about what is happening under the hood. For example, where did the DAI come from that I swapped into? Decentralized exchanges use a different method than centralized exchanges for making these trades. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) use something called a central limit order book, or CLOB, to match buyers and sellers. Basically, buyers place bids for how much they are willing to pay for an asset, and sellers place bids for how much they are willing to sell an asset. The transaction is executed when there is overlap between the buy and sell bids. An order book for Bitcoin is shown above, where the green area represents buy orders, and the red sell orders.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y6VEGb08-vJEN2FP_CsIEN_PSKjJaF3-6kB7DNkYGElReX_b71KjwCQLhUdsnszlc_YL5t13TVjmcFobMDpGj65H0yJdzuS8nOZgT8J_tQcwtRABkobZFaqUexDqg6TsjznVpUluEIfZlYlS0g)\n\n[Source](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet)\n\nCLOBs are costly to run on-chain because they are transaction heavy and benefit from fast transaction processing. Thus, DEXs implement a different approach to token swaps. Every token pair you can swap on a DEX has a liquidity pool. So, in the example above, I made my swap using Uniswap’s ETH-DAI liquidity pool. We see $54.82M of tokens are locked in the ETH-DAI liquidity pool, made up of 23.81M DAI and 15.52k ETH. As users make swaps on these liquidity pools by depositing Token A and withdrawing Token B, an algorithm automatically recalculates the exchange rate for the token pair. These algorithms are known as “automated market makers”, or AMMs, and are responsible for updating token prices on DEXs based on supply and demand dynamics.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pQyS6lxI_lBT4pKtGKxIOHZcZF7fdTLWliEOT1m3ecmAe_BvfoBUKJIqNiwqXXRCGTV5XORGivJ6kBLkHRuGXn4ojU0mIy1CT6TtKIID0KblY2CieF5DaocLXI-XoGyrrypJGXp5BFerF0nAVw)\n\n[Source](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet)\n\nNow, where do the tokens in the liquidity pools initially come from? Liquidity providers (LPs) are other Web3 users who want to earn yield on their tokens. Uniswap charges a trading fee (0.3%) on each swap, and this trading fee is distributed to the liquidity providers for that pool. LPs deposit Token A and Token B into a liquidity pool, and receive LP tokens in return. At any point, users can burn their LP tokens for their initial liquidity plus whatever trading fees have accrued to them.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1kAlRJiRHwQKpGJtYJUk_XfTTT-tEqJy-N1htSrX3A5-7SoLMgp9zaEA3JzB3qeDyM7UEbqMitjYyPzpd-PBxIom3xbfrHpG_aHinRp91R9cxSoqsDyUPGZfw7fCCg04GozC1yG4VL1I-d4fIA)\n\n[Source](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/core-concepts/pools)\n\nSo, those are the basics of DEXs. Liquidity providers deposit tokens into liquidity pools to earn trading fees. Traders use these liquidity pools to make token swaps. And, AMM algorithms reprice tokens within liquidity pools based on market conditions. Uniswap is not the only DEX out there. Other DEXs have been created that excel for different use-cases. For example, Balancer allows liquidity pools containing up to 8 different tokens, whereas Uniswap liquidity pools always contain only 2. And, Curve is a DEX focused on stablecoin swaps, resulting in [less slippage](https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-slippage-how-to-avoid-slippage-on-defi-exchanges#:\\~:text=But%20despite%20the%20massive%20upsides,quote%20price%20and%20paid%20cost.) and reduced risk of [impermanent loss](https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-impermanent-loss-9ac6795e5baa).\n\nSpeaking of stablecoins… The vast majority of Web3 tokens have volatile prices, but a subset of them, called stablecoins, are designed to maintain a stable price over time. This makes them more attractive as a medium of exchange compared to volatile tokens. As [Ryan Selkis puts it](https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2021.pdf), “no one wants to spend currency they believe will be worth 10% more tomorrow, and no one wants to accept currency they think could be worth 10% less tomorrow.” This leads into another foundational DeFi protocol, MakerDAO, which allows users to deposit their volatile tokens (e.g. ETH), and mint stablecoins for tax-free spending.\n\n## Mint stablecoins with MakerDAO\n\nIn the previous section, we swapped ETH for DAI stablecoins on Uniswap, but this is a secondary market for DAI. DAI is quite unique in how it is minted. DAI comes from a DeFi protocol called MakerDAO, where users deposit volatile assets into a Maker vault and then mint DAI stablecoins.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ajjefUWqo7Zi6vXuEsMnPOLyim1cXKxaBR5oonksxJvMZz2TzJv-6HnKOawN6dwvKyWHnxUo5VqmNanHmOXEsUZo_Em4CbVrZrFYiBIwwp55dR32pUGfrfqcEC2qwonRo0Z8HAWSFqVh87epBA)\n\n[Source](http://oasis.app/)\n\nThis is known as a collateralized-debt position (CDP), because the user borrows DAI against their collateral, and pays interest (i.e. “stability fee”) on the loan. In the picture above, users open a vault, deposit ETH into the vault, and then take out a DAI loan. The ETH is locked in the vault until users pay back the DAI loan, which is the principal amount plus whatever interest is owed.\n\nMakerDAO requires that the collateral deposit is worth more than the stablecoin loan. This is known as “over-collateralization”, and is necessary when using volatile assets as collateral. For example, let’s say you deposit 1 ETH (worth $3000), and take out $2000-worth of DAI – this makes for a collateralization ratio of 150% (i.e. over-collateralized). If the price of ETH drops by 20% the collateral is now worth $2400, changing the collateralization ratio to 120%. The vault would still be over-collateralized, but could soon be under-collateralized if the price of ETH continues to drop. In fact, in the ETH-B vault pictured above, MakerDAO automatically liquidates the collateral to pay back the DAI loan, and closes out the vault, when the collateralization ratio drops below 130% (i.e. “min collateralization ratio”).\n\nYou may wonder what the point of this is. If these vaults need to be over-collateralized, then you’re essentially borrowing with money you already have. Aren’t loans about spending money you don’t have? We may eventually see under-collateralized crypto loans as Web3 matures. At a minimum we would need verified Web3 identities in order to track who has defaulted on their loans and assign credit scores accordingly. But still, for now, there are beneficial use-cases for crypto-collateralized stablecoins.\n\nThese stablecoin loans allow users to go long their collateral asset, while unlocking a portion of its value, in the form of DAI stablecoins, which can be used for payment throughout the rest of the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nFor example, if I’m bullish on ETH, and believe it will 2x within a year, then I want to continue holding ETH. In fact, I want to accumulate as much ETH as possible, and certainly do not want to swap my ETH for a stablecoin. Swapping ETH for a stablecoin hurts me in two ways. First, it triggers a tax event, and I will have to pay capital gains on my ETH. Second, I lose exposure to ETH’s upside potential during a bull run. Instead, borrowing DAI against my ETH with a Maker vault does not trigger a tax event, allows me to keep ownership of my ETH, while also freeing up liquidity so I can make payments in the meantime.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ESpQma4cWq-JBs9i3gf5tqgFZJZ4qI6sEQh6K8ksCP5AiXKNWDGhzbKekSmDEs5A7MpZg9jTPH6qKxONMEjXDEWSzkLC_v3ji4ehB-n9xp0d6-Hhx033kVi-BBitOn4GuoM2V9cP0ytW8dWP1g)\n\n[Source](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fsjn-charts%2Fprice-chart%2FDAI-1622641047.7691.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cfdtrading.com%2Fmulti-collateral-dai-trend-may-be-changing-as-price-just-breached-above-its-20-day-moving-average%2F1109787%2F&tbnid=pkf61CR3fWgEjM&vet=12ahUKEwin-u3D4PP3AhXUbs0KHaecDEoQMygBegUIARC8AQ..i&docid=2ArDXUq5HSVNyM&w=4200&h=2400&q=DAI%20price%20chart%20regression%20line&ved=2ahUKEwin-u3D4PP3AhXUbs0KHaecDEoQMygBegUIARC8AQ)\n\nMakerDAO’s stablecoin, DAI, is decentralized and maintains its peg to the US dollar without reliance on reserves held by centralized entities, like USDT’s Tether and USDC’s Circle. Stable, decentralized assets are an important DeFi building block, and an open area of experimentation, which we’ll see [later on](#stable).\n\nYou can think of MakerDAO as a protocol for self-loans; however, another class of lending protocols exist, like AAVE and Compound, that support peer-to-peer token lending. Lending protocols like these are foundational to DeFi because they establish lending/borrowing interest rates for a variety of tokens. Now, Web3 tokens have a time-value aspect to them, just like risk-free interest rates for fiat currencies in traditional money markets.\n\n## **Lend crypto with Compound Finance**\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dMld7p17KNgmbAwHJcWfQt5nFXpnRnEhwCYd8r83xHwm1dVWsIlQNPJUYRpSnJ7biuk8F4nDosEcTWMCo3O8N8ITCl6Qgyf6t5zq4-Py7IjNtmg8-I9PuKY-LC_iRuAPmY94mxSNv83zltKpQw)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nCompound creates a peer-to-peer lending marketplace for a variety of Web3 tokens. Suppliers are paid interest for depositing their tokens into lending pools. This has become a popular passive income strategy for Web3 users in DeFi.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pbntsC08uhUOejmYf--sql7z7Bi_psVBM-05i6ohhEVjUDcPJwiFkekCBaUc9IpnHwgWgRMNqkOV9Rk_IRZYAF6JOumG6FfJMkSZWCBjoi_MQUZO7Z1berFg7B7GCcpeNXNrnBLkvpdJ3S0_1A)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nSimilar to how Uniswap liquidity providers receive LP tokens, Compound suppliers receive cTokens for depositing tokens into lending pools. At any point, users can burn their cTokens for their initial deposit, plus the interest that has accrued. For example, cETH represents ETH that is actively earning interest in Compound.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RJ25fYbqy6ttAWXYgGxgtmOidRCyLB61rn0K2f37HgXKEa_2IG9ZxbQMGNbx2N_PcWp3iaHlUoOwd-8zbgtP5gB-obSqlQsbUdf2izRVG31-ILxu96uosejG9OnXc2bYZzv9z_MoJefBQrw5Dg)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nOn the other end of things, borrowers take loans out on these lending pools. Borrowers first must supply tokens to a lending pool, and select to use the token as collateral for a loan.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jjUVtSBEaF58bZqWcmKs2J_GmXF0VYKOcvZ8CjFKLsn0RZJ0DpiYnhtdE_0qTiT5Py_ntjBc8eFmkFcfjoB7hSBtpEQgwYh2wmrjxcT-569s2I2elLi85advwtikQegU6YywGO23RX132s-dXw)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nJust like with MakerDAO, all Compound loans must be over-collateralized based on a collateral factor (similar to collateralization ratio). The collateral factor varies by token, but let’s say it’s 75%. It means I can only borrow up to 75% of the collateral I have deposited. So with $100-worth of Token A collateral, I can borrow at most $75-worth of Token B. This borrow limit is indicated to the user at the bottom of the modal (“Borrow Limit Used”) in the picture above. If the value of a borrower’s collateral drops then he is at risk of liquidation.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gFk_u30EGY9g4d7s5K4DHdWlOAL4HzqvPnaMXh0Zh6_pTdQAi5Z4qaliYye8vXY67geM4xqox4MkaKg6UUc7c7mJS2tZ8QW6RHg8lswcInDWfbSesAjmWrsu1v7qOpIBhn6hifXdv_1DAwwmeQ)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nTo close the position, borrowers repay the token loan back into the lending pool plus the interest payment they owe. Note that interest, for suppliers and borrowers, is paid in the token that is being lent/borrowed. Since I borrowed DAI in the example above, I made a small interest payment of DAI.\n\nCompound is powered by smart contracts that automatically set interest rates based on the liquidity of tokens in the lending pools. Tokens with lower liquidity will have higher interest rates, as supply and demand dictate. These are “floating” interest rates meaning they change over time. Compound calculates an interest rate for each lending pool at every Ethereum block.\n\nYou can see why liquidity is important here. The lower the token liquidity, the more it will cost to borrow the token. This issue of liquidity is a challenge for all DeFi protocols – token liquidity is required to get the protocol off the ground, and to continue offering a usable service. Generally, the more liquidity the better, so DeFi protocols compete to attract liquidity to their platform.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aoriaB2VNrmGx5L-MNrhqsybK1DYeYNsPCldFOx8Sq7CSyCHqyoPDu96UehuwNKoAni05A8o2K76wFbhFGth8KgU1jYhXyydDMucn6zZhhIlP71dwLMVkm04cpvFD2sywTf9H3zYdOElaBbuKA)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nSo how do DeFi protocols attract liquidity in the first place? Compound was the first to try out liquidity mining. Compound distributes COMP – its native governance token – to its current suppliers and borrowers. This strategy worked well for Compound, and other DeFi protocols followed suit, leading to an explosion in liquidity in summer of 2020 (i.e. DeFi Summer).\n\n## Liquidity mining to boost yield with Compound Finance\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ihUMkX5oqHMWzD9xO9C3aJR566uf7IjsoTk6Jg5RZ2dIXI3KtdidUZFr8dnjzrJf1jTufLv3VlbwdYIxfQuqcbejwD2EO9tRIQziIaQ11mp5sSGCVRVK89oWN83v9KbHJp5VLb0TQXerjM8OZg)\n\n[Source](https://compound.finance/)\n\nNotice that suppliers on Compound are actually paid two interest rates. In the example above, where I’ve supplied ETH, one interest rate pays me back in ETH. This is from the interest paid by borrowers on their ETH loan. The other interest rate is paid in COMP. This is Compound’s liquidity mining reward, which is meant to incentivize me to keep my ETH liquidity locked in the protocol.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hIYY3Cfzliq9DmdbJMji0d5Y7dYc0_1EYrAgzYVRHwpSxHnRWe-_-OcqeM0h3jMszZCEJ8TAye9wyPn4lvW8hh4CNwm1xqF25qRHjNuz29DuZfHL_QtGba0bDLjB2WPbusuwG5izwd02g2RuFw)\n\n[Source](https://medium.com/compound-finance/expanding-compound-governance-ce13fcd4fe36)\n\nBack in 2020, Compound minted its COMP governance token with a fixed supply of 10M COMP. 4.2M COMP were allocated to its liquidity mining program, which distributes 1139 COMP tokens across its suppliers and borrowers on a daily basis. This will run for around four years until the allocated COMP runs out.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pWA6WnAn6ZsBcOLPH4dpRHLH7RDgzngvBIIU_2xLnzhxycrjPR30JywC1eRLHIkulJhxwNqhnsraLGXlK3X2kii0nteB1vxsd_2UZHwl3Nl5JnWdO7r2vj2U3jEzlBAw_OljeHlUzBfsvRZdqg)\n\n[Source](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/governance?)\n\nCompound was the first to implement liquidity mining, but many other DeFi protocols followed suit, using their own governance tokens as reward. These tokens give holders the ability to vote on governance proposals that could be anything from technical improvements to adjusting protocol parameters like interest rates and the list of assets approved for collateral (e.g. MakerDAO). Discussing protocol governance leads to the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This is an entire course module in itself that will be covered later. For now, understand that DeFi governance tokens have real-world value as they are traded on secondary markets, seen in the picture above.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vDEvlwRtrOmx7aa9smdAGD7VuThHGE_8hJFicXsg3xfzDyZucXnLnJfxvr7my7F8YKlZc9nn4L9MmLera6zUsLmbPbpj0p5X_nc0O1cb_HoQkGZ4m0KoQZWoOlKRqO_-6lIjb0J7w-d-QXPUCw)\n\n[Source](https://defillama.com/)\n\nCompound launched its liquidity mining program in June 2020. Other liquidity mining programs cascaded from there, leading to a boom known as “DeFi Summer”. Liquidity flooded into DeFi protocols as yields increased across the entire ecosystem. Look at the increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) in the chart above. The TVL chart shows all the token liquidity “locked” in all of the  DeFi protocols on Ethereum. This could be tokens in DEX liquidity pools, Maker vaults, lending pools, and more. TVL is a great metric for comparing the health of DeFi protocols (e.g. AAVE versus Compound), as well as entire DeFi ecosystems (e.g. Ethereum DeFi versus Solana DeFi).\n\nSo far we’ve talked about several ways of earning yield on Web3 tokens, such as becoming a liquidity provider on a DEX, supplying tokens to lending pools, and participating in liquidity mining programs. In the next section we discuss another DeFi yield activity – staking – and show how DeFi users stack multiple yield activities on top of one another to maximize yield. This is known as yield farming.\n\n## Yield farming with Curve Finance\n\nStaking is the idea of locking tokens to receive other additional token rewards, paid out over time. This is an odd idea at first, but locking tokens in stake pools can be beneficial to DeFi protocols – let’s look at why this might be.\n\nRemember back to the first section how users receive LP tokens for depositing their tokens in a DEX liquidity pool. Not only is it important for DEXs to initially attract liquidity, but they also must retain liquidity to maintain good UX for its users. Some DEXs encourage users to stake their LP tokens in order to receive additional incentives.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WGrvwEeUBaoIrUhyvh7LDQ7QAbztMVpAsnrKY6-EMdGYIvIBywtz4Z8gan66MU6n-IgGyFH_CPIJAuikbq5KVoyd8tVDbMoHJYMWxxBDQjdazVwNRUBOZIYy4feT1dQhW-keYxHXNOaxHDx8tA)\n\n[Source](https://curve.fi/)\n\nCurve is a DEX for stablecoin swaps that offers this kind of LP token staking. Liquidity providers deposit tokens into a Curve liquidity pool, and receive Curve LP tokens. These LP tokens can be staked in Curve Gauge Pools where the user receives regular payouts of CRV tokens. Users are unable to remove their liquidity so long as their LP tokens are staked, and they are receiving CRV rewards. Do you see how this incentivizes users to keep their liquidity on Curve?\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nP56EN9LEujNel_jPA3BQKW0HFnxpvf3LE1KCVNEabzgLxe6hvQb0mmidNMaoA8nxyF6SKOF6W3ulQMyyatwBylhaJrbebW8RJG809jHJrc4SwG7pM9ble8APKTKld0XDYNNRKxkU87j6Heiww)\n\n[Source](https://curve.fi/)\n\nStaking increases yield for Curve liquidity providers. For example, in the first Curve liquidity pool above (“tricrypto2”), the yield is 1.89% from the pool’s trading fees; however, users receive additional yield – anywhere from 4.23% to 10.59% – paid in CRV tokens. This means, if I deposit $100-worth of liquidity in the pool, I’d expect to earn $1.89-worth of trading fees, plus $4.23-worth of CRV, annually.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WpzXL5usNBsOHsSMwIghgUNxZBFYi0oAoQXwJXCcYj637YDZC9Rws7XhfGXBSUefjL2YgAPQPefbKCUNB3WpUkvmWYpn187q5dntNQe6lzvTbtCbMeMQCH6Z2KL8o4eZYqqif45Zd7VcHVzaag)\n\n[Source](https://curve.fi/)\n\nThings do not end here on Curve. It has additional staking opportunities. Users can stake CRV in the Curve DAO for veCRV in return. veCRV is the governance token, so it allows users to make Curve governance decisions; however, it also boosts CRV rewards by up to 2.5x, which is veCRVs main draw. That’s why the CRV APYs – shown two images above – are displayed as a range (e.g. +4.23% – 10.59% CRV). Looking at the image above, CRV is time-locked anywhere from one week to four years. This takes CRV off the market, making it a deflationary asset, which some believe has led to its favorable price performance compared to other DeFi tokens.\n\nAre you starting to see how yields can be stacked on top of each other? On Curve, users can deposit tokens into a liquidity pool to earn trading fees. They can then stake their LP tokens to earn CRV rewards. And then stake their CRV tokens to boost their CRV rewards. This is what “yield farming” is all about – stacking yield to maximize return on investment.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3sBouB8yTPTHmknyOqabv6TAo0RmdNmAWIFJUyLzdS3FL-13dlY_sTlaMweMpuF5Jz2_0u4EvBvwtlk93xq6yMcEeaiG8gPk5T3uWjE2Q-6irB0bRyer1RbFaHf19Ho8qWoXcBEv25Dhrkal4Q)\n\n[Source](https://curve.fi/)\n\nBut all this makes my head spin. The yield farming I’ve described here is complex, manual, and costly. For example, CRV rewards accumulate over time and users must manually claim CRV on Curve’s UI (image above), which requires a transaction and costs a network fee. Yield aggregators – another class of DeFi dapps – solve these problems by automating yield farming for users. Users’ funds are pooled together in vaults that follow pre-programmed yield farming strategies designed for efficiency and maximal return.\n\n## Automated investing with Yearn Finance\n\nYearn Finance was one of the first yield aggregators. On Yearn, DeFi experts propose yield farming strategies and implement them as Yearn vaults that Web3 users can deposit tokens into. Essentially, these vaults aggregate a lot of tokens, and deploy them to various DeFi protocols, sharing the yield with its depositors (i.e. yToken holders).\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/y_WUIL4p4Jb1yP3sUNdbNS-36iiH9J0Xd1uhwYrhM2TcOfOS8wuqXE-OTqYbEUM9zPzvV8HqYQ8m_sYFg-RmItZi3c7TQ3iUEkbILjCbilnDUDbp-GmZ74cayOw4sjZuaxYXaDAgPsR_ZUrVKQ)\n\n[Source](https://www.designweb3.io/defi-for-ux-designers-web3-design-bootcamp-2022/.finance/#/vaults)\n\nYearn vaults generally accept Curve LP tokens, and automate the yield farming process from here, such as moving tokens into different lending protocols in pursuit of the highest interest rate. Or, stake the LP tokens in other protocols, and automatically recycle the rewards back into the vault for a compounding effect.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P7h4rP4bhqH5nZ9Grx2iDMX1396B6_IPVTqszcEY5i80UYqpxqOoILDwRRh7-pRk3BF6DnAPpzdgLS8YjEz0u04rxPixL8NEl--MQFPBTOJGoPO-2V6Wpab84Q915UV2vLYZ4ebstLm7iSYDSA)\n\n[Source](https://yearn.finance/#/vault/0x3B96d491f067912D18563d56858Ba7d6EC67a6fa)\n\nThis brings us to a concept called “token composability”, which is at the heart of yield farming. Essentially, Web3 tokens are interoperable with other protocols. DeFi tokens can be used throughout the DeFi ecosystem in order to stack rewards.\n\nLet’s look at Yearn’s “Curve USDN” vault strategy. Users deposit crvUSDN tokens into this Yearn vault. Yearn then stakes these LP tokens in another DeFi protocol, Convex Finance, to earn CRV and CVX. As the vault earns tokens, Yearn automatically harvests them and converts them into more crvUSDN, which it cycles back into Convex Finance. This automation simplifies yield farming for users, and reduces their network fees. They only need to send two transactions: one to deposit tokens into a vault, and the other to withdraw tokens from the vault.\n\nAt this point in the article, we’ve discussed all the major DeFi building blocks:  tokens swaps,  minting stablecoins, lending/borrowing, staking, and yield farming. This all takes place across different protocols, often requiring the user to visit multiple web apps. This can make the DeFi ecosystem feel scattered. DeFi dashboards bring everything together for a more seamless UX. Let’s look at how dashboards take advantage of the open-source nature of Web3 to stitch DeFi protocols together into one dApp.\n\n## DeFi dashboard with Zerion & Zapper\n\nDeFi dashboards provide the user access to multiple DeFi protocols all from one UI. The first way to think of these dashboards is that they extend wallet functionality. Popular browser extension wallets like MetaMask have small UIs with limited feature sets like viewing token balances and sending tokens to other wallets.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Lo5xVyBEgU03fhvvCtt1D0FooOkr3zYzfKqpppoOqvGi6Mwf6RbuNoCTgipyXX_2IqBtRYvBJKHpP9Tz4uGhhhRTGGd9u22AWeI_fu_nRy7zkjoxWd4JQomVfbg5jqDvrIc5u2z8kT9Q8_bGWw)\n\n[Source](https://zerion.io/)\n\nHowever, users can connect their wallet to a dashboard like Zerion to view their wallet as an asset portfolio, not just simple token balances. These portfolio views help users see how their wallet’s value changes over time. Also, Zapper allows users to bundle multiple wallets together so they can track the combined value of multiple wallets.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/S8Io25NHVGZEpXZeuFLxZGjf6CqXe3gtisABlIjkiLfYUurJ8jWaduEbXql66SCTxI72MW3hwbeTTEcp65dFPpH1OFR6cUdzDwyF51iOa4znK2locEPC_zyK9_b1jB4zrRI6DSr67wlLYIdvNw)\n\n[Source](https://zapper.fi/)\n\nDashboards also directly integrate multiple DeFi protocols into one UI. This is an example of open-source software composability. Web3 protocols are open-source so other projects can use them as building blocks in their own dApp. This is juxtaposed to the proprietary APIs of Web2 applications. Users can search for the best yields across the entire DeFi ecosystem, and directly deposit tokens into lending protocols (AAVE and Compound), liquidity pools (Curve, Sushi Swap, Uniswap), staking pools (Curve and Convex), and yield aggregator vaults (Yearn and Harvest). All accessed from Zapper’s “invest” tab.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q2WE_eWzohgYWuBPvBs_EA3KbHhuSJhfqBuP5w6I5tBHKqb9OzkhjkhTOwtH7-pWdIAF9dXGwsmIHjvPfY77xT-CWVsAS_M0BWzqBC9dtFGClV9tkeRNepQO_Ib3MHe0PORA1oJzfxYZjDLa6g)\n\n[Source](http://zerion.io/)\n\nThese dashboards are packed full of other useful features. For example, the Zerion dashboard has “swap” functionality that searches across multiple DEXs to find the best exchange rate to execute a token swap. This is called a DEX aggregator, and is a convenience utility for Web3 users.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/N7nu-04R2vjjeqnfLgTv0gme2OKXDqj5_3ftfGXGtPk4HKTfUTk5KD-RVSS9qyWAAlrS-GCxpSeRLna30bArDP4_nGgMi8_rBbuo2crJqWSpObdyO8y_9TaDXYzKT_XdWjQNcAzBtcN_dlRqyQ)\n\n[Source](http://zerion.io/)\n\nThe thesis that we will live in a multi-chain world continues to be proven correct. More and more, people will use multiple blockchain networks, and will increasingly want to transact tokens between these cryptonetworks. Blockchain interoperability has a long way to go and Web3 ecosystems feel siloed; however, dashboards are well positioned to improve the UX here.\n\nZapper tracks the value of a user’s portfolio across 11 different cryptonetworks (all EMV-compatible). And, Zerion aggregates blockchain bridges so that users can transfer tokens to other Layer 1 cryptonetworks (BSC, Avalanche, Fantom), Ethereum Layer 2s (Optimism, Arbitrum), and sidechains (Polygon), all from one UI.\n\nSo that wraps up the first wave of DeFi from token swaps to dashboards. There are other protocols I consider slightly less foundational than what we’ve covered, but the curious reader may be interested to look into some of them. DeFi Derivatives platforms allow users to trade advanced financial instruments like options (Opyn), perpetuals (DyDx & Perp), and synthetic assets (Synthetix). Also, there are token index funds that diversify a single investment across multiple tokens (see Index CoOp). This is the same idea as ETF’s and mutual funds in traditional markets. Finally, there are insurance protocols that protect users from things like impermanent loss, and DeFi smart contract exploits (see Nexus Mutual).\n\n## DeFi 2.0 & Stablecoin Wars\n\nInterest rates have been at all time lows in traditional markets over the past several years as the U.S. 10 Year Treasury Bond hit 0.60% APY in 2020. At the same time, DeFi was on the rise, giving investors alternative markets to earn much higher (albeit riskier) yields. All the DeFi products we’ve talked about were some of the first to find product-market fit in Web3, evidenced by the fact that they onboarded millions of users onto Ethereum; however, like any first iteration of technology, there exist some problems in the current DeFi ecosystem. Let’s discuss some of the problems facing DeFi 1.0, and peer into the emerging DeFi 2.0 landscape, which seeks to address them – starting with stablecoins.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kbty10E9jy4VOk2fpa9wPHhTaPblAqtaGzk2WJSsZxkxZlq-Jk36dPztj_6Biio7kkdU_eAdIASfafrRTaayTMltHgYfcueMe7SuEUoMBUBzEVtrF1X36Dl0H4MvjNgU40bHnd5gD84Ml9iDlw)\n\n[Source](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins)\n\nDemand for stablecoins is rapidly increasing as the Web3 ecosystem is more and more in need of non-volatile assets for things like payment. There are many types of stablecoins each with their pros and cons. And it’s also an active area of experimentation as entrepreneurs search for optimal stablecoin designs. Let’s take a look at the different stablecoin categories.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/a8fDAH9e7HsZjmTLOjx-zUms0CGbs7rB_CIclCUiWpVjB3kOr79ajJ8FyI5HQJkB73bCHVSdlVXAO-ptUDVkzmcxkdZkqBZvskq9P_4Pz7gidI2Ui6uKvG74BE7XtZBQ8iyGE2JK9LkcgOnppA)\n\n[Source](source:)\n\nThe first category is fiat-collateralized stablecoins. These are, by far, the most popular right now based on market cap. Here, regulated companies, like Tether and Circle, issue stablecoins that are fully-backed by their fiat reserves. USDC and USDT are pegged to the US-dollar, but some stablecoins track other currencies (e.g. EURS). Historically, fiat-collateralized stablecoins have maintained their peg better than others; however, their fiat reserves are custodied within the traditional financial system. Governments have the ability to seize these reserves and undermine fiat-collateralized stablecoins, which many consider unacceptable for a means of payment in the world of Web3.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_xBivLVJB54CvAclb7eGL2vDOzbMugURgHocOMEfdWr-xHhiF1Fyt_XivFScoD3dOCFQQvheGccvakePsSGuG4vsTGBuIAFtGBMeA7chM-lNVgtgsmYQfR5leNkUN-KJ-t4NNZ2oFAHnh7Y26g)\n\n[Source](http://pexels.com/)\n\nEnter crypto-collateralized stablecoins. This brings us back to [MakerDAO](#maker) where users can deposit crypto into Maker vaults and mint DAI – a stablecoin also pegged to the US-dollar. This is a big deal, because the crypto collateral backing the stablecoins cannot be seized by centralized entities. Thus, crypto-collateralized stablecoins are truly decentralized; however, the problem is that crypto is volatile, and using it as collateral is risky because the value of collateral can quickly fall below the loan’s value. Therefore, crypto-collateralized stablecoins must be over-collateralized, which isn’t an efficient use of capital.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y_5YSx9USftSN19miF4VRx3WLQlZVZTU9WUPH-HMyd9BASljkwHyNpvOqyvt_jhofmnnISVnSuBKRhayMlnrrmjO4PngfLgXmCtG4yJ5-dc6koDDJQ5x3AXlsRXGjSSkeNwNyxW60FuqSoV78Q)\n\n[Source](https://alchemix.fi/)\n\nMakerDAO was the first crypto-collateralized stablecoin protocol. Since then, other DeFi protocols have iterated on, and improved the original MakerDAO concept. For example, the crypto locked in Maker vaults is just sitting there, not earning yield. On Alchemix, users deposit crypto collateral to generate alUSD – Alchemix’s stablecoin. But here, Alchemix deposits collateral into Yearn Vaults that earn interest, which is used to automatically repay the user’s alUSD loan. It’s a self-repaying loan. Similarly, Abracadabra.Money supports yield-bearing tokens as collateral, like Yearn (e.g. yvDAI) and Convex (e.g. cvx3pool) tokens. But I digress – let’s move onto the third stablecoin category – algorithmic stablecoins.\n\nThe first two stablecoin categories are asset-backed. Either fiat reserves, or crypto collateral in vaults, support the price of the aforementioned stablecoins. A lot of recent experimentation has been done on algorithmic stablecoins, which have no assets backing them. An algorithm automatically maintains the peg of a stablecoin based on real-time market conditions for that stablecoin. This is usually done through mint and burn mechanics. Let’s pause and talk about the most popular algorithmic stablecoin – UST.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/U7NYeDDmApwAAbaRBj5ntdTJ2QvxNgf4fryEYba3PjHNQPUV0OzltvQV0Tce3OciOuNUzhJuCzeYAy81QgI7EP7V7fX_QFmgFZM0f5SC-aBKqo-4wNuTZt_pSF-9hUCKaMIUTpv_hDag5qk2eQ)\n\n[Source](http://cointelegraph.com/)\n\nUST is built on the Terra blockchain, and is pegged to the US-dollar. UST is paired with Terra’s native token – LUNA, which is a volatile crypto asset. UST and LUNA can be exchanged in a 1:1 ratio with each other. At any point, 1 UST can be minted by burning $1-worth of LUNA. Alternatively, 1 UST can be burned in exchange for $1-worth of LUNA. Arbitrageurs utilize this mint-burn mechanism when UST is trading on centralized exchanges for a premium, or at a discount. For example, let’s say UST breaks its peg, and trades at $1.02 on a CEX. Arbitrageurs can burn $1-worth of LUNA, and mint UST in order to realize a 2% gain. On the other hand, if UST is trading at $.98, then it can be exchanged for $1-worth of LUNA. This is how UST maintains its peg.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/i0b6h4k3Ku2Fp78vOkx8WFoUzpyGTunyxCnPyy9nXNxpZuNxI5WW4t7FIW5-fhz6jx0-_mfM9bcXlQ3b4_trqDILJQsfo1UZ98HR4BmsJtgGcAUaaZu7zb4XgcYLCiBRsCMyJ5nD5df3yadTmg)\n\n[Source](http://coinbase.com/)\n\nHowever, it’s ironic that I’m writing this now. Just last week UST failed massively. There was a major sell-off in UST as investors lost faith, reflexivity kicked in, and caused an even greater sell-off. Billions of dollars of UST were liquidated over several days, and UST is sitting at around $.09 at the time of writing. This points to the immaturity of algorithmic stablecoins, and puts into question the feasibility of algorithmic stablecoins in general.\n\nThere is another category of stablecoin – fractional reserve stablecoins – that is a middle ground between algorithmic and crypto-collateralized. These stablecoins are partially crypto-collateralized hence the term “fractional reserve”, and partially rely on an algorithm to maintain their peg. FRAX is the most popular example of fractional reserve stablecoins.\n\nAll the stablecoins we’ve discussed so far are pegged to fiat currencies. The issue with this is that pegged stablecoins are beholden to central banks that control the monetary policies of fiat currencies. Some argue it’s unacceptable to have any reliance on central institutions in the decentralized Web3 ecosystem. The final category of stablecoins we talk about is non-pegged stablecoins. OlympusDAO is the most popular project in this space with its non-pegged OHM stablecoin.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dLKK4mWyZmBUVUhfa5iXhcD7cvmCyyd-Ew29ywtAU25MW9-tCd8uluu1bozAxPANFeM0hLHuhmSyI5AsmGh1YrCtvFmt9laGH6DlM3bb-LYX-spS6Z4AQoNDLS7eysLq5SaiJmv7hyxK0orZiw)\n\n[Source](https://app.olympusdao.finance/?_gl=1\\*1y30td0\\*_ga\\*MTQ1OTQ5ODEzNS4xNjUyOTk5MDA5\\*_ga_QV7HNEEHV9\\*MTY1MzI0NTIzMC41LjAuMTY1MzI0NTIzMC4w#/dashboard)\n\n“Stablecoin” is a bit of a misnomer for OHM. Currently, its price is around $17 – and it’s been as high as $1,300+. So OHM can be highly volatile, but one of the main features of OHM is its floor price, or risk-free value. Users exchange crypto with OlympusDAO for discounted OHM in a process called bonding. All bonded crypto is held in OlympusDAO’s treasury, which ensures a floor price of at least $1 OHM. Thus, the value of OHM is free-floating, but users can always have faith in the floor price, backed by Olmypus’ war chest.\n\nThis leads into the next problem that DeFi 2.0 is attempting to solve – that of deep, permanent token liquidity. OlympusDAO controls a massive treasury, which is a great example of an upcoming concept – “protocol controlled value” (PCV). The protocol can deploy liquidity as it sees fit to ensure liquidity for its native token, or to earn yield and grow the treasury larger. Also, their protocols can rent out their liquidity to help other protocols bootstrap token trading, or bolster their liquidity pools.\n\n## Deep liquidity with OlympusDAO\n\nWe know that liquidity is important in all aspects of DeFi. Without tokens in liquidity pools you can’t make swaps on DEXs, borrow tokens in lending protocols, and enact automated yield farming strategies. Without liquidity DeFi grinds to a halt. And the more liquidity the better. For example, the more liquidity in a DEXs liquidity pool, the less slippage users are subjected to when making token swaps. That’s why DeFi protocols compete with one another to attract liquidity, and increase the TVL of their protocol.\n\nLiquidity mining, first seen with Compound in 2020, attempted to overcome the liquidity bootstrapping challenge. Protocols mint their governance token, and distribute it incrementally as a reward to its liquidity providers. Unfortunately, this only solves the liquidity problem in the short-term. Liquidity mining programs attract mercenary capital. Without loyalty to any single protocol, users switch their liquidity between protocols whenever higher interest rates popup elsewhere. It’s difficult for protocols to maintain this liquidity, and they have to continue inflating their governance token in order to do so. But more and more, liquidity is managed at the protocol-level, called “protocol controlled liquidity” or “protocol owned liquidity”.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/feMv6VPozdjdTvzpKqZ9tPKHtmnsUYe33dH7NItAU1NISlYa8h6pPAckhB87TBoyQeQHmghZiorjv9IRD_l9B3_85kOaXVyGV5iWnvV7LqIer3GWIgCdHmDTfYEVeS8SUrLhVhtcNL2Ul_l3mQ)\n\n[Source](https://app.olympusdao.finance/?_gl=1\\*1y30td0\\*_ga\\*MTQ1OTQ5ODEzNS4xNjUyOTk5MDA5\\*_ga_QV7HNEEHV9\\*MTY1MzI0NTIzMC41LjAuMTY1MzI0NTIzMC4w#/dashboard)\n\nDeFi 1.0 protocols do not own user liquidity. Users own their LP tokens, and can redeem them for the underlying liquidity at any time. This is changing in DeFi 2.0. Let’s go back to OlympusDAO, and users bonding their crypto in the treasury. Here, user crypto is exchange for discounted OHM. In this case, the users no longer own their liquidity – the liquidity is now permanently held in OlympusDAO treasury. In fact, OlympusDAO controls over 99% of its liquidity in DEXs (e.g. OHM-FRAX LP & OHM-DAI LP).\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YEfsBVnZOYCFEduWnnVJCjj_LuVtVQ1r6u-85HUH5cbDz0pywAwbisMfwj8kTR9bC7oN3Xwc7I63toVPxiJ7y3QIzq6JweWxqDU_Xf5dPvzFBaU0ewwNC2qcXH58qyvFg9vuIYzvCjn31dRYzQ)\n\n[Source](https://app.olympusdao.finance/?_gl=1\\*1y30td0\\*_ga\\*MTQ1OTQ5ODEzNS4xNjUyOTk5MDA5\\*_ga_QV7HNEEHV9\\*MTY1MzI0NTIzMC41LjAuMTY1MzI0NTIzMC4w#/dashboard)\n\nThis ensures that the liquidity remains in place so that users can trade in and out of OHM, with low slippage. Also, the protocol earns almost all of the liquidity pool trading fees, and is becoming a large holder of SUSHI, which all work to further grow the protocol.\n\nFrax Protocol is another good example of PCV. Users mint FRAX stablecoin by depositing their crypto assets into Frax protocol’s reserves. Frax Protocol applies automated market operations (AOMs) on its reserves for a variety of reasons. For example, its collateral investor AMO moves USDC reserves into lending protocols like Compound and Yearn, which earns interest. Another AMO provides FRAX liquidity on exchanges like Curve and Uniswap to ensure deep liquidity pools for FRAX-stablecoin pairs. Fei Protocol is similar – the protocol controls reserves for yield farming strategies to grow its reserves, as well as to provide FEI liquidity on Uniswap.\n\nThese protocols can also rent out their liquidity to other DeFi protocols, known as liquidity-as-a-service (LaaS). Tokemak is a great example of this. Essentially, individual liquidity providers deposit tokens into reactors, and liquidity directors (LDs) rent out this liquidity to various DEXs. LD’s create liquidity on-demand – they vote on which token reactors get paired together, and which DEXs to send these token pairs to. Of course, Tokemak earns DEX trading fees, which its building up a treasury with. This treasury, controlled by TOKE governance, will be utilized for additional LaaS operations in the future. Tokemak is like a liquidity aggregator, supplying liquidity to other specific areas in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/suLBeT0mtfw6y-9oQIWMyqDp3QtD7cd9D1uKystaS97A4w_fgny2qIRrHiUWVYI3plEZSUeT0klhWgsfNCAdBjOTWVEEmdPHa-tpWkISQfUwwLUhGfqM808KQECc2Ek_yzPNNSqnl9ju6c0AZg)\n\n[Source](https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympus-pro-introducing-fantom-cohort-1-launch-partners-b4ff40f78538)\n\nFinally, LaaS is being used to help other up-and-coming protocols launch their native token. Before, to start sellings a token on a DEX you either needed to seed the liquidity pool with a lot of up front capital, or attract users to bring their own liquidity. This brings us back to liquidity mining, which we’ve already established is ineffective in the long run. However, now, OlympusDAO launched a product called Olympus Pro, which generalizes its token bonding mechanism for other protocols. For example, users can bond their LP tokens in exchange for the protocol’s discounted governance token. Now that protocol owns the LP tokens, so the liquidity will remain in place without continuous liquidity mining. This is known as “protocol pwned liquidity” (POL).\n\nAlso, FEI and FRAX have partnered with Ondo Finance, which provides liquidity pools to protocols looking to list their governance token in an IDO – initial DEX offering. The protocol deposits its governance token in a pool, which is matched by either FRAX or FEI stablecoins. The Frax and Fei protocols earn 5% APR on the liquidity it provides. This is like renting out stablecoin liquidity so that other protocols can quickly get up and running selling their governance tokens.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nI, Travis Kassab, am not a financial advisor, tax professional, broker, or legal advisor.

[Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\n\nIn the previous [Blockchain Design Course](https://www.designweb3.io/blockchain-design-course-2022/) module we talked about blockchains – the technology that underlies Web3. These are sometimes referred to as Layer 1 protocols. Blockchain protocols defines how nodes communicate, and come to consensus, with each other in order to form a functioning cryptonetwork. Everything is centered around the cryptonetwork’s native Web3 token. In this article we will about about Web3 tokens in general: both utility and security tokens, as well as fungible and non-fungible tokens. Web3 tokens change the game as far as open-source software development goes – the future is bright! This article is an extension of the [Web3 Design Course 2022](http://designweb3.io/).\n\nBy the way – there’s also a video version of this article (see below).\n\n[https://youtu.be/AkuZavstg_s](https://youtu.be/AkuZavstg_s)\n\n## Billions Rely on Internet Protocols Everyday\n\nSoftware protocols have been crucial in the development of information technologies. Billions of users everyday rely on internet protocols to access the web. These internet protocols dictate how networked computers request and share information with each other. Let’s take a look back at how these protocols developed, and where we are currently in terms of the development of the internet as a whole.\n\nThe internet is simply a network of connected computers. Once computers are physically connected in a network, software protocols standardize how these computers share data with one another. This includes rule sets for locating other computers on the network, sending data packets to a desired location, and checking that messages were received and correctly interpreted. These internet protocols can be broken into four layers:\n\n1. Hardware protocols\n2. Internet Protocol (i.e. IP)\n3. Transmission Control Protocol (i.e. TCP)\n4. Application Protocols (e.g. HTTP)\n\nHypertext Transmission Protocol (HTTP) is an important application protocol. HTTP defines how a computer requests data from, and serves data to, another computer. A common example is for a computer to request an HTML file from a web server (using an HTTP GET request) in order to view a web page on its internet browser.\n\nThis HTTP GET request then gets passed down one layer to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which tells the computer how to break the message into smaller data packets that will be sent one by one to the web server. TCP is also used by the web server receiving the data packets in order to assemble the data packets back into the original message.\n\nThe Internet Protocol (IP) ensures that the data packets reach their intended destination. Before sending the HTTP GET message via TCP, the IP wraps data packets with an IP address corresponding to the web server. This is like the “To:” field on a mail envelope. Finally, hardware protocols convert the data packets into electrical signals that get transmitted through the internet’s physical infrastructure (e.g. cables, modems, routers).\n\nOn the other end, the web server will send back an HTML file using the same HTTP and TCP/IP process described above. Now you have a rough idea of how the web functions with a set of open-source internet protocols. These protocols were developed by independent researchers and non-profit organizations, and haven’t been modified much since the mid-1990’s. All of the web products we enjoy today would not exist without these internet protocols.\n\n## The Internet is Still Evolving\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/AA87N2dwmm8AHdgb8pltzVpiFmLAITtmznbnHrhAPoniJx8T1cDEk6dxrjkFIe6hKtt5Tx_BLwFG9bwz2jMyjonFB1Htk25G7T4R_YU2shLVMYcYj9ywK1rsdfYtbgjrpENYQDj2y_4LL8ZuIg)\n\nThis is a good point to talk about the evolution of the internet. We can break the internet’s development into three phases: Web1, Web2, and Web3.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QEbHXWaBY4nYwGVXXbPKoDJQl5NTqyY30o1S3ZTjlo_X2Tlf2OKuUpktWDFFKPg6Aoz2HZpU09QR4YQZYc10Vt-zBYHG-bu8WCEFvXFy1YPsgfzH-65Jk8DebO6ejhyOW1dG7tW_)\n\nWeb1 is characterized as “read-only” because only a few entities published content for consumption by many. The internet was thought of at this time as a digital encyclopedia. Users accessed static web pages containing text, images, and hyperlinks; however, there was little interactivity for end-users other than consumption.\n\nThis brings us to Web2, which is also referred to as the “social web”. Online communities and identities began to emerge at this time. Web2 is especially characterized by social media platforms, and the idea of user-generated content. Now everyone had the ability to create content, build a social network, and react to the posts of others (e.g. like and share buttons). The web went from a few content creators to billions. If Web1 is considered “read-only” then Web2 can be considered “read-write” for the average user. Centralized web platforms attracted users with large networks and simple user experiences.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6TdqseOLkpK-AJksy5DNv4Ye8wy3wGAJPS2CSIkqTSY8ja5IuVjkOcmN-9iH9XRyk5tffqkORvARMU8tgokeitttmGMCZDhlZV5guvFTqb3L7UZekQKcJjftHFqQx84IvQLcC4KH)\n\nThis has ended in a winner-take-all dynamic. There are several monopoly-like companies, such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook, that largely control how the internet is experienced by end-users. For example, users must agree to the terms and conditions of these centralized companies if they want to participate in the dominant social network. Also, Web2 companies have the rights to all the user data generated on these platforms, which they mine and sell to advertisers. Roughly 98% of Facebook’s revenue is generated in this way. It’s a strange idea that we’ve become accustomed to – that users who join a network, and increase the value of that network with their presence and activity, capture little, if any, of the value they create.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zvsHFAEMk_wOQ-Ma_SkjMVnyg4YNC1UkgojkGI5hzBooWwXHmMgdJJgFwuH9I9LWvImL3pIPWAQ4kna4duHVfazzY7VFFRu1NEZKJnMbnr7ccjH8AuVaE57a9DMwRseSYyqZrfRr)\n\nAdditionally, large user bases act as an economic moat that protect Web2 companies from competition, making these platforms cautious of third-party development, and product integrations. This incentivizes Web2 companies to close-off their ecosystems, which stifles innovation. For example, Apple is able to reject applications from launching on its app store for any number of reasons, one of which being competitive risk. And, even when it accepts applications, Apple takes a hefty 30% cut from the application’s revenues. Of course, third-party developers are paying for the privilege to launch on a platform with a reach of over 1 billion iOS users. Still, one wishes for something better than a system that extracts value from its end-users, and regards third-party development coolly, if not with open-hostility.\n\nTo recap, going from Web1 to Web2, we went from open-source internet protocols, intended to decentralize information sharing, to monopoly-like, centralized social networks that limit end-user choice, and third-party integrations. Web3 can remedy the current issues with Web2. Web3 users can literally self-custody their data, identity, and other digital assets with cryptographic wallets. And, developers can now choose to build applications on neutral, open-source Web3 platforms (i.e. blockchains). Web3 removes rent-seeking middlemen and connects users directly to the applications they want to use. If things change, they can pick up, and move to another ecosystem that better suits their needs, without the loss of data or other digital assets.\n\nOne of the major innovation’s of Web3, and something important to wrap your head around as a Web3 product designer, is that Web3 aligns incentives better than the current system. Developers, end-users, and cryptonetwork service providers (i.e. nodes) are all incentivized to work towards the same goal – the growth of the cryptonetwork. This is all made possible by Web3 tokens.\n\n## The Role of Web3 Tokens\n\nWe’ve discussed in previous modules of the [Blockchain Design Course](https://www.designweb3.io/blockchain-design-course-2022/) that tokens native to a cryptonetwork incentivize nodes to secure, and maintain, that cryptonetwork. These nodes can be thought of as network service providers. They dedicate their resources to provide a decentralized blockchain database for dApps to build on top of, and are rewarded with that cryptonetwork’s native token.\n\nAdditionally, native tokens are staked by these nodes to ensure that they act according to the best interest of the cryptonetwork. This secures the cryptonetwork from attack because stakes can be slashed. The cryptonetwork is also protected from denial of service attacks by requiring users to pay for their usage of the cryptonetwork with its native token. This makes spamming the network with unnecessary transactions prohibitively expensive.\n\nIn other words, the native token coordinates, and incentivizes, globally distributed, independently-acting nodes to maintain the blockchain, while at the same time protecting it from attack. This is all kind of complicated. You may notice this is unnecessary in the world of Web2 because companies cover the cost of the centralized databases their applications run on. But, as we already talked about in the previous section, there are hidden costs with centralized gatekeepers who have unilateral control over the platform, and its data. Simply put, tokens make possible the decentralized, open, and neutral properties of Web3.\n\nThink back to what we learned about internet protocols. They were developed over 30 years ago by independent researchers and non-profit organizations, and haven’t changed much since. In the beginning, before the enormous commercial value of the internet was realized, it was difficult to get funding to build out the protocols. Now, protocol developers can create a cryptonetwork and hold on to a portion of the native token. If the protocol provides value, and is adopted, then the token price will increase in value, because the token is required to use cryptonetwork in the first place (see above). Also, the founding team can sell off some of the tokens to fund initial, or ongoing, development. Thus, Web3 tokens provide a direct value capture, and funding, mechanism for open-source protocols.\n\nThis brings us to the next point – Web3 tokens help bootstrap cryptonetwork adoption. Remember, networks are proportional in value to the number of users in the network. Facebook is much less compelling with only 100 users, and AirBnB just isn’t that useful with only 100 hosts. So it’s difficult to get things off the ground; however, cryptonetworks can reward its early-adopters – whether that be developers or end-users – with its native token. If the network succeeds then the early-adopters profit greatly, rewarding them for the value they provided to the network early on. Also, now that they are token holders, and have a financial stake in the network, early-adopters are incentivized to help grow the network through word of mouth, or social media promotion.\n\nThink about the internet as divided into two layers: the protocol layer (e.g. HTTP, TCP/IP, etc.) and the application layer (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, etc.). In Web2, all of the value accrues to the application layer, which has led to some of the most valuable companies in the world today. Remember there was no effective way to capture value from open-source protocols until Web3 tokens came along.\n\nThe [fat protocol thesis](https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/) posits that value will consolidate at the protocol layer in the Web3 era. As dApps, built on these Web3 protocols, go mainstream and attract hundreds of millions of users, the protocol’s native token will increase in value. This is because the native token is required to use the dApps – a classic example of utility tokens, discussed in the next section. An increase in token price signals a growing ecosystem, which will attract more developers to build out additional functionality on the blockchain, which will attract more end-users. Web3 tokens are responsible for positive feedback loops like this.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/w8IAPY21Bgj8pHALeoUgtwVHmG8H_Gl5qFfjWiuBBZem3fDGYbpnpT5A3G8lxihKoB2KsdEe35ikRp0SNnOxeCdQBSsrbzNDHgrwHdOHHYDVED7t6DxibvyX86RadtKf-FN-zUV8)\n\nAs mentioned before, internet protocols have not changed much since their initial release back in the 90’s. There were efforts to make modifications, but it was too difficult as there was no clear ownership over the protocols. Now, cryptonetworks are beginning to build governance, and upgradeability directly into the protocol. Token holders can vote on protocol improvement proposals. The more tokens they have the more their vote counts. Some believe this is unfair, especially when individual users hold a disproportionately large share of the protocol’s token; however, it is important to point out that the more token you hold, the more financial stake you have in the protocol. All token holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the protocol because the token value can appreciate or depreciate depending on the outcome.\n\nIn this section we talked about many of the dynamics brought about by Web3 tokens. To summarize, Web3 tokens get distributed to all cryptonetwork stakeholders: protocol developers, third-party dApp developers, end-users, and network service providers. This is why cryptonetworks are sometimes referred to as “community owned and operated” networks. Everyone in the cryptonetwork is aligned to the same goal – for the cryptonetwork to grow and prosper so that the value of the token increases. This is vastly different from the misalignment characteristic of the current Web2 system.\n\n## Web3 Token Categories & Use-Cases\n\nIn the previous section we talked about the role played by tokens native to cryptonetworks. As you may have heard there are literally thousands of Web3 tokens in existence today – some native to cryptonetworks, and some launched on top of these cryptonetwork. This vast token landscape can be broken into two high-level categories: utility tokens and security tokens.\n\nUtility tokens are by far the most common Web3 token. These tokens are used to access cryptonetwork services. Ether is a good example of a utility token, because it is used to pay for using the Ethereum blockchain. In other words, users pay ether to Ethereum nodesfor processing their transactions. All smart contract blockchains have a native utility token like this. Ethereum is a general purpose cryptonetwork that can run all sorts of dApps; however, there are other specialized cryptonetworks. Just as an example, Sia and Golem are cryptonetworks that provide decentralized cloud storage and cloud compute, respectively. Users of these cryptonetworks redeem SiaCoin (SC) and Golem Network Tokens (GNT) to utilize these decentralized services.\n\nThe other major category is security tokens. Securities in the traditional finance world include things like stocks and bonds. Organizations issue securities in order to raise capital, whereas investors purchase securities with an expectation of some return over a period of time. These investment vehicles are regulated by the SEC in order to protect investors from fraud and ensure fair, efficient markets. Security tokens are registered securities that are transacted on the blockchain for [faster and cheaper settlement, and more transparency](https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-141-european-investment-bank-eib-issues-its-first-ever-digital-bond-on-a-public-blockchain) compared to traditional markets. Organizations have already begun issuing [stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/news/equity-ethereum-firm-offers-real-stock-through-ico/) and [bonds](https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-141-european-investment-bank-eib-issues-its-first-ever-digital-bond-on-a-public-blockchain) on Ethereum. Other security tokens are backed by real-world assets like precious metals (PAXG), commodities (XPD), and [real-estate](https://www.blockdata.tech/blog/general/tokenized-real-estate-2021-update) (IHT).\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9-2vdHS8VHhL3tKF0GMbqeZ7h0X-USATyW7ltvOcwQsAB-wQwlDC6RxmI2-bCAbrJBOJSqCzmE7pavcKgbER5lW09ctqT5vbLFrymzOUG2ar0F9s0Z3go1LgGwj97NTNG0xyjG1V)\n\nNotice the difference between utility tokens and security tokens when it comes to regulation. Security tokens play by the rules of traditional capital markets and willingly undergo government regulation during their launch; whereas, issuers of utility tokens claim that their tokens are not securities and, therefore, do not need to comply with securities regulations. The SEC, led by Gary Gensler, largely disagrees with this claim – he says the vast majority of “utility tokens” appear to him as unregistered securities. This is one of the great tensions between the US government and Web3 at the moment, and we’ll see later in this article.\n\nIt’s difficult to place stablecoins in either of these token categories, but they deserve an honorable mention as they grow more and more popular. These tokens are designed to maintain a stable value over time. This makes stablecoins more attractive as a medium of exchange compared to other Web3 tokens that experience high price volatility. Usually, stablecoins are pegged in value to a fiat currency like the US Dollar. For example, the two most popular stablecoins – USDC and USDT – are fully-backed by US dollar reserves held in traditional financial institutions. These are called fiat-collateralized stablecoins; however, there are other emerging stablecoin categories such as crypto-collateralized (e.g. DAI), and algorithmic stablecoins (e.g. OHM).\n\nNow, let’s go back to utility tokens. There are many sub-categories of utility tokens, and it’s difficult to fit any one token into a single category – they usually belong to multiple categories at once. Below I list some other use-cases of utility tokens, nost as an exhaustive list, but to give you a flavor of the experimentation that is being done on token design.\n\n* **Governance:** Allows users to submit, and vote on, improvement proposals for protocol upgrades. They first came onto the scene with some of Ethereum’s popular DeFi protocols (i.e. Compound, MakerDAO, and Uniswap). These DeFi protocols distributed their governance tokens to their users, effectively decentralizing the governance of the protocols. Now token holders have significant influence over the evolution of the protocol, not just the core development team.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Cashflow:** Earn a portion of the protocol’s revenues – this is often called “staking”. For example, most smart contract blockchains allow users to stake the cryptonetwork’s native token, and earn block rewards for doing so. Also, UNI token holders receive a portion of the swap fee that Uniswap charges for facilitating token swaps.\n\n<!---->\n\n* \\*\\*Discounts: \\*\\*This is a common use-case on crypto trading platforms. For example, holding CEL token gives users preferential interest rates when lending/borrowing on Celsius Network, and BNB and FTT get users discounted trading fees on Binance and FTX, respectively.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Gaming:** Most Web3 games have in-game currencies that can be redeemed for in-game items. For example, virtual animals can be bred with one another using SLP token in Axie Infinity. Also, MANA is consumed in oder to generate land plots in Decentraland’s metaverse.\n\n<!---->\n\n* **Social/Community:** The most obvious use-case here is with social media influencers who launch a token backed by their own reputation (see [Rally](https://rally.io/)). Social tokens give patrons a direct way to support celebrities, influencers, and artists while enjoying additional benefits like access to exclusive content, entrance into in-person events, access to private online communities, and more.\n\nSo these are the Web3 token categories, and some of their use-cases. Let’s now talk about token launches, and some of the problems associated with token launches. We’ll eventually get into the regulatory issues surrounding Web3 tokens.\n\n## Web3 Tokens as Real-Time VC Investments\n\nAll Web3 tokens have a pre-defined monetary policy controlled by the blockchain. For example, is it an inflationary or fixed-supply token? And if it’s inflationary, what’s the token’s issuance schedule? This monetary policy is fixed, and cannot be changed once the token has been launched.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nNvY0fY6_ExWN87vCXaUB-j0MdoShdD-fud9fQEvEPh6sPkuYpl5gUELg4bnhIxURfKRxQ-hC6Eu1talrnfPZkmG8WZdZdgjPRgizBuNmkpqiw5p7ixXQ57TWos4SfNv-tbVQZFX)\n\nAs we’ve seen, most cryptonetworks have their own native utility token, which powers the network; however, smart contract blockchains give anyone the ability to launch their own token, defined by its own monetary policy and programmed with arbitrary utility. This led to an explosion of new Web3 tokens on Ethereum starting in 2017. Now tens of thousands of Web3 tokens exist across various cryptonetwork ecosystems.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4io7mtAfU--YNInpcHy0Gg6-h5kY_Cp0T6rI7npNaT2Mjn37uela97KWcF5PHCa5nWMNtSoV_Q_h8IThwdLlaYQ4uBvAGtQpSo2JW7BRSlW8XGP0NpB6VCkAMGvMkwC6tFcxVGvp)\n\nWeb3 projects often publish a website and a whitepaper that explains the team’s motivation and approach. This inevitably leads to a discussion about the Web3 project’s token, specifically its monetary policy and token distribution plans. Let’s say a blockchain launches with a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. Pie charts often illustrate how these tokens will get distributed to project stakeholders. For example, a portion of the tokens are sold to public, and/or private investors, to fund the development of the project. This crowdsale is called an ICO, or initial coin offering. Other tokens are usually distributed to the founding team, the project’s treasury, or adjacent foundations.\n\nWeb3 tokens also democratize venture capital investing. Up until now, investing in early-stage startups has only been available to accredited investors through Series A, B, and C funding rounds. The 1000x gains already have been realized by the time retail investors have the opportunity to invest. Also, typically, VC investments are illiquid – after the funding round, it often takes years for the startup to find product market fit so that seed investors can realize a profit. Web3 tokens change the game. They are like highly liquid venture capital investments, with real-time price feeds, sometimes before the project launches.\n\nSo far, Web3 tokens have been successful at funding the development of Web3 ecosystems, but let’s now talk about some concerns, starting with the obvious one: scams. Anyone can launch a token and sell it on the open market. In the past, people have launched tokens without a legitimate project backing it. Scammers create intriguing marketing content and hype it on social media to create demand for their token, without any intent on building a product in the first place. When others start buying the token, the token price goes up, and the scammers dump their token supply on the open market. The token price then crashes, and the original investors are left holding a worthless scam token with no legitimate project backing it. This is called a “rug pull”.\n\nToken launches themselves present their own problems. Who has access to the token’s crowdsale? Does the token get distributed to many individual retail investors? Or, are the crowdsales just available to big-money, private investors like VCs. If VCs, or the founding team, hold a large portion of the cryptonetwork’s token supply, then this calls into question the true decentralization of that cryptonetwork. Some argue that this is no longer a neutral, decentralized network, but one that is controlled by a large minority.\n\nThere is an alternative to crowdsales – something known as a “fair launch”. Satoshi launched the Bitcoin protocol in 2009. There was no crowdsale of pre-allocated bitcoin. Bitcoin nodes just started mining bitcoin, and the circulating supply of bitcoin grew from there. Yearn Finance, a popular DeFi protocol, is another example of a fair launch. It distributed 30,000 YFI tokens to early-adopters of the Yearn Finance protocol in what is called a “token airdrop”. Juxtapose these fair launches to other Web3 projects with token pre-allocations and crowdsales. The diagram above shows how Layer 1 smart contract blockchains distributed their initial token supply.\n\nPerhaps from the perspective of Web3’s ethos – that of decentralized inclusivity – fair launches are preferred to public crowdsales, which are preferred to large token pre-allocations to private investors, founding teams, and adjacent foundations. I’m not trying to pass judgment here – it’s a complex issue that founding teams are experimenting with. Token launch is one thing, but the sustainability of the project over decades is another. The SEC definitely takes a stance on this. Anything other than a fair launch appears to the SEC as the sale of unregistered securities, which they intend on regulating over the next several years.\n\n## Looming SEC Regulation of Web3 Tokens\n\nThe SEC determines whether or not something is a security with the Howey Test, a precedent set by the Supreme Court lawsuit between Howey Company and the SEC back in 1946. Howey Company operated a hotel with an adjacent orange grove. The company started selling plots of the orange grove to its hotel guests. The owners of these plots would have rights to a portion of the revenues generated from the orange grove. Howey argued this was the sale of real-estate; however, the SEC argued this was the sale of a security and won the Supreme court case, thus establishing the definition of a security. Something is considered a security if it is:\n\n* An investment of money\n* In a common enterprise\n* With the expectation of profit\n* To be derived from the efforts of others\n\nClearly, according to the Howey Test, the crowdsale of Web3 tokens constitute a securities offering that requires SEC regulations in order for US investors to participate. But what is the purpose of SEC regulations, and what does it mean for Web3 tokens moving forward? The SEC cares about protecting US investors from fraudulent activity, and wants securities markets to operate fairly and efficiently. Security token issuers must make disclosures to reduce information asymmetries between the issuer and the investor. Also, the SEC would be able to hold fraudulent token issuers accountable, like the scam tokens discussed in the [section above](#token).\n\nThe downside is that there will be much more friction when it comes to launching security tokens. Launches will take longer while waiting for SEC review, and will cost more due to the increase in legal overhead. Also, this token regulation will likely make it more difficult for retail investors to get the same exposure to early-stage Web3 investments as they currently enjoy in the wild-west of ICOs. Some security token frameworks have been established to simplify the process of regulated token issuance – see [SAFT](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/simple-agreement-future-tokens-saft.asp) to learn more.\n\nHowever, the Howey Test was established back in the 1940’s, and many Web3 evangelists believe that securities laws are too outdated to handle Web3 tokens. They argue that the regulatory framework needs modification to effectively handle emerging digital assets. An example of this is [Hester Peirce’s Safe Harbor](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/peirce-statement-token-safe-harbor-proposal-2.0) proposal, which allows for unregulated token issuance as long as the Web3 project decentralizes ownership and governance of the protocol within three years from launch.\n\nThe proposal takes advantage of the fact that an asset can change from a security to non-security over time. In other words, an asset that starts off as a security offering, may eventually change so that the Howey Test no longer classifies the asset as a security. On several occasions, the SEC has alluded that this is their view on Ethereum. Ether started as a security offering with its public crowdsale; however, the token has been distributed across so many independent actors that Ethereum can no longer be considered a “common enterprise”.\n\nLast thing to say, there are regulatory bodies, other than the SEC, that have a stake in Web3 technologies. These include the Fed, Treasury, CFTC, OCC, CFPB, and FDIC. As Ryan Selkis points out in [his annual crypto report](https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf), currently these entities range from neutral to openly opposed to Web3. There is still much to be determined in terms of regulation. Regulatory outcomes are sure to affect the growth and evolution of Web3 around the world. It’s unclear at this point how it will all play out; however, some jurisdictions are trying to attract Web3 entrepreneurs and businesses with more welcoming dialogue and regulation. Foreign countries like Switzerland, Germany, and Portugal, as well as US states like Wyoming, Texas, and Florida are among some of these Web3-friendly havens.\n\nAll the Web3 tokens mentioned thus far are “fungible” tokens. Fungibility exists in the real-world, with fiat currency being a good example. One paper dollar bill is equivalent in value to another paper dollar bill. Fungible tokens are the same way: one bitcoin is equivalent in value to another bitcoin; however, non-fungible tokens serve vastly different purposes. In the next section, we’ll give a background on non-fungible tokens and discuss their varied use-cases.\n\n## Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) & Cryptomedia\n\nAgain, let’s start with the concept of fungibility. Fungibility means that an item can be replaced by another equivalent item. Currency is a good example of something that is fungible. One ten dollar bill is the same as another ten dollar bill. Even though the bills were printed at different times, in different locations, on different pieces of paper, we still consider them equivalent to one another, because they are fungible. Fungibility just means that an item can be replaced by an equivalent item.\n\nMost things in the real-world, however, are non-fungible. People are non-fungible. The family heirloom, passed down to you by your grandparents, is non-fungible. The Mona Lisa, hanging in the Louvre in Paris, is non-fungible. And your life memories are non-fungible.\n\nNow, let’s take this concept of “fungibility” back into the digital, Web3 world. Bitcoin is fungible because one bitcoin is equivalent to all other bitcoins. Currently, most digital content is fungible. Think of image, video, and audio files – we can infinitely replicate them, and share with thousands of people, effectively for free, with the click of a button; however, thanks to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) we can now make digital files rare, or “scarce”, for the first time ever. And just like fungible tokens, anyone is free to launch NFTs on public blockchains. This is known as “minting” NFTs. Whereas fungible tokens have a token supply, all NFTs are unique, and distinct from one another. They are 1 of 1.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FZoxpzEStbe0rPsTsj_nzhmCX41vQfu1IGS8dWe0N1-FQvbAvDBcCX6xsVZQ5CPb6fXfdQrMhSt3k_IsjdPvFXr6D7ZrCoQZlvONtrZv3KHjzws4iUgP7LW_q-zV2Pbsb11Ifwfs)\n\nOne of the first major use-cases for NFTs has been one-of-a-kind digital art. Now, patrons can purchase digital art as NFTs, and custody the NFT in their Web3 wallets. 2021 was a big year for NFTs with over $17B worth of NFTs transacted. And some of these NFTs have demanded seemingly outrageous prices for digital art. A collage by a well-known artist Beeple, sold for $69 million dollars – this was the most expensive NFT ever sold, and the third highest price ever paid for work by a living artist. Check out these [other popular artists](https://gothammag.com/top-selling-nft-artists) making millions of dollars from their NFT sales.\n\nWhen first learning about NFTs, most people don’t understand why someone would spend millions of dollars, or any money for that matter, to purchase a jpeg that is publicly accessible. Indeed, the Beeple NFT can be viewed, downloaded, and shared by anyone. This is known as the “right-click save” misconception. The true game-changing power of NFTs is that ownership of the original Beeple NFT can be proven. Whoever purchased this NFT now custodies it in his/her Web3 wallet, and anyone can verify this ownership because it is a public record on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LDbvXMeO8_K8nB4Ki_9W_qdqMj7cGvhFLLYTi8uN9W0ZZ5ZK6GoGdV0U7T1WyEUKxLzEUdapChR86CV4WN40txdUQQM_TZBGZ8aZkJG8J1HE1mxfR9LRWav1KHci4DQba1Xrr7v22ev63L0AUw)\n\nAnother NFT-related phenomenon is PFP, or profile-picture NFTs. These are collections of NFTs, usually depicting avatars that vary based on attributes like background, jewelry, clothing, and other accessories. The two most popular PFP collections are Crypto Punks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). Passionate communities have sprung up around these NFT collections, and membership isn’t cheap. For both collections, a total of 10,000 unique avatars were minted, and the cheapest BAYC NFT is currently selling for 132 ETH (\\~$370k).\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZsTAnmz9XG0TgW5xpEvfO-r67tirdxAdvXohP27ZbZGIP_PT2WmJjeIO740I7tvrdk05A25CDJ9Rjf8S5cBuDBTP-uiDuDlQY99VcWsF-BTZcSHOykw0B95uldYvQvcgCdt0ojKF)\n\nNFT marketplaces are important infrastructure for NFTs, and they will continue to grow in importance as demand for NFTs increases. These marketplaces are like eBay for NFTs. Owners can list their NFTs for sale, either as an auction or buy-it-now. Purchasers come in to bid on NFTs, and the marketplace’s smart contracts send the NFT to the winner’s wallet address. OpenSea is the most popular NFT marketplace for the secondary sale of NFTs. Other marketplaces curate special kinds of NFTs (e.g. Artblocks & AsyncArt), and host the NFT drops of popular artists (e.g. SuperRare & Nifty Gateway).\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7T9J50-eMfyZb1u8p6OH7liBIPBCkbxd_-nUw1SYa5MLdC2ymKNYAFk9B1YW4cFU9rO6MB6CFelcI13xT8HBU6eMjIpceAdR8x_FaRV6Cj0VRy3ZH9NjD7SExxeDGy5tK_Zca9W-)\n\nNFTs are much more than visual art. As I said before, any digital file can be made unique with NFTs, including audio, video, text, code, and more. Web3 music is up-and-coming where patrons can purchase one-of-a-kind, or limited edition songs on platforms like [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/). Also, you can mint an NFT of your blog post on [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), which has been used for [fundraising creative projects like documentaries](https://decrypt.co/76349/ethereum-documentary-fundraise) among other things. Finally, some of the internets original source code, discussed in the first section of this article, was sold for $5.4 million dollars as an NFT. The list goes on.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cyxOmhp-FioO7yfC8qneFn4Qu5E28r7F9IYhR3RXDJHe90QRFnapvpc1QodQaKWpRgZmbT5Tg6JtYhZaz26-XRe0Hv4E175_bZIwc1FIhcfSXzCmhmUzdFK1YqKG50GUuMVR4_Y4T8yk2a-7cA)\n\nEven digital media in general is just scratching the surface of NFT use-cases. NFTs can be programmed with arbitrary functionality. For example, NFTs can be used to give access to online communities like private Discord servers, or be used to access in-person events. Also, NFTs allow artists to capture royalties on secondary sales of their artwork without any legal contracts. The NFTs can be programmed in such a way that a percentage of secondary sales are automatically sent to the artist’s wallet address. We are just in the beginning stages of NFT experimentation – it’s not hard to imagine future use-cases where NFTs serve as our digital identities, or digital belongings that we carry with us through the Metaverse.\n\nThis brings us to the end of the Web3 Token module of the [Web3 Design Course 2022](http://designweb3.io/). We learned how Web3 tokens are a disruptive force in that they incentivize open-source protocol develop, and align the economic interests of all stakeholders on cryptonetworks. These tokens are often sold to raise funds for the development of Web3 projects; however, the SEC considers this the sale of unregistered securities so we will see the rollout of regulatory frameworks to deal with Web3 tokens. Finally, there are two main types of Web3 tokens: fungible and non-fungible (NFTs). We are still in the early days of what these tokens are capable of. Many brilliant entrepreneurs are experimenting with various use-cases.\n\nIn the next course modules we will be doing deep-dives into the Web3 ecosystem. Everything before this has been meant to prepare you for understanding Web3 product categories like DeFi, Cryptomedia, Creator Tools, Social Media, Digital Identity, Data & AI/ML, GameFi, Metaverse, and Autonomous Organizations. Can’t wait to get into it!\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nI, Travis Kassab, am not a financial advisor, tax professional, broker, or legal advisor.

　　那些城门并没有人为破坏痕迹，应该就是倚云公子的张县令画皮下令开城门，允许昌县百姓外逃以自救。 \n  \n 　　昌县已经彻底亡了。 \n  \n 　　已经没必要在继续坚守的意义。 \n  \n 　　所以。 \n  \n 　　当晋安神魂一回壳。 \n  \n 　　他立刻找到老道士。 \n  \n 　　“老道，赶紧收拾下，我们连夜马上逃出城，昌县已经彻底沦陷。” \n  \n 　　还不等老道士吃惊开口，晋安马上又说道：“昌县几座城门，官府已经主动打开城门了。” \n  \n 　　收拾行囊的事，并不麻烦。 \n  \n 　　其实早在文武庙被炸之前，晋安就已经做好跑路打算，大部分细软都已经收拾好。 \n  \n 　　而在文武庙被炸的混乱期间，老道士也已经收拾好所有要带走的东西，准备明天跑路。 \n  \n

　　晋安的话，让原本紧张的逃命气氛，顿时乐呵了不少。 \n  \n 　　老道士乐了：“还是小兄弟你想得周到。” \n  \n 　　老道士瞟了眼被晋安喂得膘肥体壮，跟个牛犊一样强壮结实的山羊，立马屁颠屁颠跑去厨房卸大锅去了。 \n  \n 　　尤其是那对羊角，盘曲得跟对牛角一样又大又粗，尤其引人注目。 \n  \n 　　跟平常的家养羊明显就不一样。 \n  \n 　　咩咩咩—— \n  \n 　　这头傻羊，平日里娇生惯养，衣来伸蹄饭来张口，只吃花生米跟红萝卜，啥时候干过跟驴一样的坨重物苦活，一开始它是剧烈挣扎不肯的。 \n  \n 　　直到被晋安锤了一拳后就老实?老老实实背黑锅。 \n  \n 　　咩…就连叫声都在晋安面前软绵绵多了。 \n  \n 　　这头长得跟个牛犊似的傻羊?精明得很，一顿吃饱?跟顿顿吃饱?它还是能分得清的。 \n  \n 　　因为山羊身上驮得东西多，过不了限宽院门?晋安二话不说，直接把院墙给拆了?这才顺利出了门。 \n  \n 　　出了门?看着被熊熊大火点亮的昌县夜空下，到处都能看到昌县百姓在恐慌往城外跑，到处都有混乱哭喊声传来，晋安与老道士面色凝重的对视一眼?然后也开始跟着其他外逃的人?往昌县外逃命。 \n  \n 　　晋安让老道士跟山羊走在自己身后，而他则是手提长刀走在前，一路吓退那些目光不善想趁火打劫的盗贼、江湖草莽。 \n  \n 　　一老一少一羊，还没逃命出多远，却发现周围的外逃百姓越来越少?直到路过一座民宅时，大开的房门?门槛前的路面洒了一大滩猩红血迹。 \n  \n 　　“救我……” \n  \n 　　“救救我……” \n  \n 　　有好几人的痛苦低吟声，从大门大开?什么都不清的幽暗冰冷屋子里传出。 \n  \n 　　恰在这时。 \n  \n 　　晋安察觉到有几双躲在黑暗里的目光，窥伺上了他与老道。 \n  \n 　　他眸光凛凛?直接注视向那座门前洒血的民宅?在黑乎乎门洞后?在什么都看不见的黑暗里，有邪恶目光正窥伺他们。 \n  \n 　　但晋安望去时，那种窥伺目光又消失了。 \n  \n 　　晋安清楚，这是因为他随身带着的那张五雷斩邪符，让暗中邪祟不敢直视他双目。 \n  \n 　　但黑暗屋子里的痛苦低吟声，还在继续响着。 \n  \n 　　“什么东西也敢窥伺我？” \n  \n 　　“找死！” \n  \n 　　《六十路开碑手》之第三式！熊靠背！ \n  \n 　　轰隆！ \n  \n 　　屋墙狠狠一震，仿佛有一头凶悍强壮的棕熊狠狠蹭树，砰！ \n  \n 　　砖墙崩塌。 \n

　　在屋子的黑暗一角，赫然是几具尸体缠绕在一块的树根怪尸，共有三张面色平静，二目闭着的死人脸，它们一动不动，平静得仿佛是一座异常丑陋的树根雕像。 \n  \n 　　但就是这样的平静树根怪尸，它们已经活吞了两人，折断的手脚，压断的躯干，已经跟树根怪尸扭曲，缠绕一起。 \n  \n 　　此时的两人都已经奄奄一息。 \n  \n 　　鲜血流了一地，浑身鲜血淋漓，刚才晋安听到的痛苦低吟求救声音，正是从这两名被吞噬活人喉咙中发出，吸引来更多活人让树根怪尸活吞。 \n  \n 　　而且随着失血过多，这两人的体内不再有鲜血流出，改而分泌出黑液，将他们与树根怪尸更加紧紧的缠绕、黏连一起，永生永世，不分彼此。 \n  \n 　　惊悚！诡谲！怪诞！ \n  \n 　　这两人的伤势太严重了，脊椎与内脏都被压爆，已经是回天乏术，几息后，两人彻底断气。 \n  \n 　　老道士心生不忍的叹息一声：“从此以后，这世上又添了两个孤魂野鬼。” \n  \n 　　老道士叹息着，然后念超度亡魂的经文，希望能送两位苦主的亡魂，好好重新投胎做人。 \n  \n 　　哪知。 \n  \n 　　老道士忽然目瞪口呆。 \n  \n 　　“小兄弟，这两人才刚死，老道我刚才念超度经文，此地居然没有一个阴魂响应。” \n  \n 　　“不对啊，这两人才刚死，阴魂不应该这么快就离开尸体。要成为孤魂野鬼，那也过完头七，一直无人下葬尸体，为其立阴宅，无阴宅可归的阴魂才会成为四处飘荡的孤魂野鬼才对啊。” \n  \n 　　“除非……” \n  \n 　　“这两人的阴魂被更邪恶的邪祟给吞噬了，借此壮大那个邪祟的阴气！” \n  \n 　　听了老道士的话，晋安目光一沉。 \n  \n 　　“难道说…那棵千年邪木青钱柳，能够借着这些树根怪尸吞噬更多人的三魂六魄，即便不离开文武庙，也能一直壮大自身阴气？或者说…借此反哺自身，来恢复自身受损的阴气？” \n  \n 　　“那岂不是说，只要有这些树根怪尸分布在外，青钱柳就永远杀不死？” \n  \n 　　“除非消耗青钱柳阴气的速度，快过它的恢复速度……” \n  \n 　　这些都是短短瞬间，晋安心头浮现而出的猜想。 \n  \n 　　思及此，晋安手中长刀有赤芒一闪。 \n  \n 　　噗哧！ \n  \n 　　树根怪尸体表如坚铁，寻常刀剑难伤，但在如今敕封过两次的虎煞刀前，依旧削铁如泥的切开两半。 \n  \n 　　噼里啪啦。 \n  \n 　　怪尸体内的恶臭内脏，顿时洒了一地。 \n  \n 　　然而。 \n  \n 　　晋安发现，即便被劈为两半了，但眼前这些树根怪尸的内脏，依旧还在不停分泌黑液。 \n  \n 　　就连身体表面也在不停分泌黑液。 \n  \n 　　除了被赤血劲劈斩开的平滑伤口处，因为赤血劲的滚烫气息不停灼烧伤口，阻止黑液分泌，其它身体表面在不停分泌黑液。 \n  \n 　　这玩意，似乎并未被他杀死？ \n  \n 　　最为直观的观察便是，那两名被吞噬的活人体内，也在继续分泌着黑液。 \n  \n 　　并未因为树根怪尸被晋安劈为两半，而就此停止分泌黑液。 \n  \n 　　看着这一幕。 \n  \n 　　晋安当即眉头皱了下。 \n  \n 　　这时候，手举火把的老道士，也像是发现到了这些细节，惊诧道：“奇怪了，小兄弟，老道我怎么总觉得地上这些树根一样缠结的邪尸，还没死透。” \n  \n 　　老道士说完。 \n  \n 　　从他那挂在肩头上的太极八卦褡裢里，拿出一张破邪符黄符。 \n  \n 　　“天地自然，秽气分散，道炁常存……急急如律令！”老道士念动咒语。 \n  \n 　　破邪符上的朱砂阳气、雄鸡血阳火，遇到阴煞东西，无火自燃，刹那，就将眼前劈为两半的树根怪尸点燃成火炬。 \n  \n 　　火焰燃烧了一会，随着黄符上的灵性耗光，树根怪尸表面的汹汹火光熄灭。 \n  \n 　　“咦！” \n  \n 　　老道士吃惊大讶。 \n  \n 　　因为那些树根怪尸，这次又是未被杀死，体表依旧在分泌黑液。 \n  \n 　　身体表面的火焰，正是被这些体内分泌出来的黑液给隔绝、熄灭了的。 \n  \n 　　就连此前被晋安一刀劈开的伤口处，那些赤血劲也都已经被扑灭，伤口处正大量分泌出墨黑如树汁一样的黑液。 \n  \n 　　这回晋安和老道士都吃惊不小。 \n  \n 　　想不到这看起来平静，连动都不会动的树根怪尸，居然这么邪门得紧。 \n  \n 　　物理驱邪、道术驱邪，都双双不管用。 \n  \n 　　怎么都杀不死。 \n  \n 　　而越是如此，晋安越是忍不住感慨，符兄果然牛逼！ \n  \n 　　眼前才三具树根怪尸或者说是五具树根怪尸，就让他跟老道士都有些束手无策，普通人碰到必然十死无生。 \n  \n 　　因为这个树根怪尸等同于无法杀死。 \n  \n 　　敕封三次的五雷斩邪符，何其珍贵，晋安自然不会浪费在这里，他原地沉吟片刻。 \n  \n 　　“小兄弟，老道我咋有种不好预感，感觉这些像树根一样的邪尸，它们体内分泌黑液，像是要重新聚合，重新活过来一样？” \n  \n 　　老道士的话，让晋安心头一动。 \n  \n 　　植被分泌树汁，可不就是一种自我保护，自我愈合伤口吗？ \n  \n 　　《黑山功》！火毒内气！ \n  \n 　　噗哧！ \n  \n 　　虎煞刀再次劈砍中树根怪尸。 \n  \n 　　但这次他未马上拔刀出来。 \n  \n 　　而是黑山功内气猛的灌输入刀身内，炽热火毒，立马通过与树根怪尸接触的刀身，一股脑的灼热宣泄入邪祟体内。 \n  \n 　　咔嚓！ \n  \n 　　咔嚓！ \n  \n 　　树根怪尸这次从内部碳化，犹如一团扭曲丑陋的木炭。 \n  \n 　　砰！ \n  \n 　　晋安拔出虎煞刀，因为用力过大，木炭化了的树根怪尸，直接崩裂成数截，仿佛是从内部蒸发掉所有水分，份量变轻，清脆倒地。 \n  \n 　　这回总算没有黑液分泌。 \n  \n 　　彻底杀死。 \n  \n 　　晋安目光一喜。 \n  \n 　　他又如法炮制杀死还剩下的半边树根怪尸。 \n  \n 　　而这么一会功夫，他修炼满五层的黑山功内气，已经消耗了近半，这算是得不偿失，反而还浪费了宝贵的逃命时间。 \n  \n 　　晋安决定，下次再碰到这些树根怪尸，绝不再过多缠斗。 \n  \n 　　“老道走吧。”晋安喊上老道士，继续往城外逃命。 \n  \n 　　只是这回才刚逃没多远，此刻满城混乱的昌县，两人一羊又碰到突发状况。 \n  \n 　　“啊！救命！救命！” \n  \n 　　“这是什么怪物！” \n  \n 　　从一条胡同里，响起惊慌失措的哭喊声，以及杂乱奔跑声，人数还不少，足足有十来人的仓惶逃命脚步声。 \n  \n 　　当晋安赶到胡同口时，正好看到有数名昌县普通百姓，拖家带口，背着细软行囊，跌跌撞撞的仓惶跑出来，那些昌县百姓一看到手持长刀的晋安，就如惊吓过度的人，一下看到救命稻草，全都狼狈的跑向晋安。 \n  \n 　　“救命！求求你救救我们，我们身后…我们身后有一个怪物！” \n  \n 　　当晋安走进胡同时，闻到了浓烈血腥气味，一名活人已经被两具手脚缠绕的树根怪尸吞噬，融为一体。 \n  \n 　　扭曲崩裂的身体，鲜血洒了一地。 \n  \n 　　人已经没得救了。 \n  \n 　　噗哧！ \n  \n 　　赤色刀芒撕裂黑夜，晋安一刀将树根怪尸劈为两半，就算他无法短时间杀死这些树根怪尸，那也要让它们短时间内失去反扑杀人的机会。 \n  \n 　　免得这些诡谲怪尸跟上他们。 \n  \n 　　冷不丁一个偷袭他。 \n  \n 　　当晋安手提刀刃上黑液还未干透的长刀，走出胡同时，看到老道士正安慰着之前逃出胡同的那群人，而其中一名中年妇人手里牵着名小孩，正在焦急找人。 \n  \n 　　那名中年妇人看到晋安从胡同里安然走出来，手里紧紧抓着孩子手不放的她，连忙跑来焦急问晋安：“请问你有没有看到我孩子他爹？” \n  \n 　　“刚才孩子他爹还跟我们走在一起的，可在逃跑中，我们一家三口被人群冲散了……” \n  \n 　　中年妇人手里牵着孩子，焦急向晋安形容丈夫的外形，听完对方的形容，晋安轻叹口气。 \n  \n 　　刚才他在胡同里见到的被树根怪尸缠绕，吞噬的活人，正是眼前中年妇人的丈夫。 \n  \n 　　虽然这个噩耗，常人难以接受，但晋安还是如实回答，安慰对方节哀顺变，人死不能复生。 \n  \n 　　在这场大逃亡中，人命薄如草芥，与其抱有一丝幻想，不如尽早接受残酷现实，才能面对接下来更残酷的逃亡。 \n  \n 　　这才没逃命多远，就已经遇到两次诡谲的树根怪尸，晋安预感，恐怕接下来的逃亡路，只会更加艰难。 \n  \n 　　虽然对那名中年妇人一家得遭遇感到惋惜，但晋安的逃亡路不会停止，他带上老道士、驮着锅碗瓢盆的山羊，继续上路。 \n ", "timestamp": 1654300272, "digest": "INpQ2Gnpk-svpQSHZjl3MK2FJSSl231NDVKKbQQcc6k",

我和其他人一样，喜欢这些。在每个值得我们纪念的重大事件中都包含着某人的死亡和残酷的流血牺牲，在这些事件结束后，事件的日期变成了我们重要的纪念日。我想我们可以坐下来聊一聊，来纪念今天。 当然有一些人不希望我们说话。为什么呢？是因为他们知道，虽然可以用警棍阻止人们交流，但语言将永远充满着力量。对于那些愿意倾听的人来说，那是对真理的阐述，而真理能让人们活的更有意义。而事实是，这个世界有很多拿不上台面的错误，不是吗？\n\n残忍和不公正，苛责和压迫。曾经你有反对的自由，可以按照你认为合适的方式来思考和发言，而现在有内容审查员和监视系统的老大哥，强迫你服从，要求你服从。这一切是如何发生的？该怪谁呢？当然，有一些人比其他人更应该承担这个责任，而他们终将被追究责任，但还是实话实说，如果你要找有罪的人，你只需要照照镜子。我知道你为什么这么做。我知道你很害怕。谁会不害怕呢？战争、恐怖、疾病。有无数的问题串通起来腐蚀你的理性，夺走你的常识。恐惧占据了你的心智，在你的恐慌中，你转向了你唯一可以求助的地方，政府。他们承诺给你秩序，他们承诺给你和平，而他们所要求的回报是你的沉默、你温顺的服从。我们的希望是提醒这个世界，公平、正义和自由不仅仅是词语--它们是我们的观点。因此，如果你什么都没看到，对这个政府曾犯下的罪行一无所知。那么我建议你允许我们不留下痕迹的交流。\n\n但是，如果你看到了我所看到的，如果你感受到了我所感受到的，如果你愿意像我一样寻求。那么我请求你们站在我身边，站在彼此身边，不要等待，而是夺回我们的未来，夺回我们的未来。\n\n##

[——马里奥·萨维奥，1964年12月于“自由演说运动”中的伯克利大学](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FV411q7g1/)\n\n我一生中大部分时间都认为自己是与众不同的，我相信我在这个世界上是孤独的。 在这个世界上，无论我走到哪里，在每一个社会环境中，我都会遇到一种潜在的感觉，即我在通过一块屏幕看着我的生活，而生活中没有“我”。我是在屏幕上看着生活在我面前上演，这些与我交往的朋友和家人好像真的得到了满足？我所看到的每一个地方都存在痛苦，为什么人们乐于把66%以上的时间花在工作或睡觉上？当我问这些人并向他们提出质疑时，我得到的回答让我感到困惑，\"事情本来就是这样的\"，\"需要把食物放在桌子上\"，但他们也接受了生活可以更精彩的说法。 我学得越多，就越感到痛苦，我试着从政，开始时是右派，作为一个有经济头脑的人，慢慢地越走越远。 [社会主义](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89)、[马克思主义](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/%E9%A9%AC%E5%85%8B%E6%80%9D%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89)、[共产主义](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%A7%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89)，我加入了[灭绝叛乱组织](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%8D%E6%8A%97%E6%BB%85%E7%B5%95)，成为了一个完全的[无政府主义](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A0%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89)者，但我发现还是失望，不愿意做那些组织上要求必须做的事。政治内斗耗尽并消耗了所有崇高的事业给人带来的力量。 无政府主义和自由主义本应是政治光谱的两端，但在我看来，它们是政治光谱中唯一能在普遍真理上达成一致的两端。 一个普遍的真理。人类需要自由。 当Covid-19大流行病袭来时，我发现自己在乞求混乱，乞求大屠杀，乞求街上的暴动，乞求世界上的任何事情都能让我感到自由。 街道上的骚乱，任何事情都可以让世界变得像我发现自己的存在一样混乱。 但它从未到来，人类做了人类所做的事，我们在头脑和心里都知道这是错误的。 我们知道这是不对的，但我们很害怕，我们寻求安慰和保护，我们顺从，而那些不服从的人则被排斥在外。我们中那些想站出来的人被那些想站出来的人被逼着顺从，[疫苗护照](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%96%AB%E8%8B%97%E6%8A%A4%E7%85%A7)，限制着我们的自由。 我不是一个反疫苗的人，我打了第一针和第二针 \"疫苗\"，我在疫苗上使用了引号，并不是说我是反疫苗的。 我使用引号也不是为了说明它是其他东西或危险的东西，而是为了强调一些......我们不喜欢谈论的东西。还有什么 \"疫苗 \"可能需要每三个月就打一针呢？\n\n比特币之所以美丽，是因为它是真正的、纯粹的、去中心化的。是的，如果一些矿工停止它的价值会下降，哈希率会改变，但它不能被阻止，也不能被禁止。 它不能被禁止。只要有买家愿意与卖家交换，它就会一直发挥作用。 只要有买家愿意和卖家交换它，它就会一直运作下去。CULT的设计同样是去中心化的，一旦它被分发，就不能被阻止。 CULT的每次交换都将有部分发向国库。 只要有提案，就会有源源不断的资金流入。 只要有提案，就会有源源不断的资金用于任何愿意改变世界的crypto协议。 我主要关心的是如何推出代币，人们是善变的，持反对意见者说 \"不\"，即使我们想，也无法做到完美。我已经把钱花在让Cult DAO启动和运行，我希望它能获得成功，所以我应该推销它吗？ 我应该参与什么？因此，我决定这样做，我将启动一个代币销售，没有营销费用，50%的募集资金将被锁定为流动资金，我将偿还我的支出。 我将偿还我的支出，其余的将用于一次性的营销，以传播文化的信息。 我将偿还我的支出，其余的将用于一次性营销，以传播CULT的信息。在这之后，我将休眠，离开社区，让社区、”许多人”和守护者看管CultDao。 我可能在未来参与，也可能不参与，我已经累了，我已经建立了很久。当你觉得你是唯一能看到这个世界和这个系统的人时，你就会觉得很累。 当你觉得只有你能看到这个世界和系统的真实面目时，你就能感受到这个世界的重量，就好像只有你能感受到它。我的愿望是让Cult不只是成为一个分散的风险投资协议，我希望CULT投资那些激进分子和革命者。CULT是被遗弃者的家，是那些感到疯狂的人的家，是那些与众不同的人的家。 我们是火药，是点火器，我们是所有唱歌，所有跳舞的人，是世界的垃圾。我们是火药，是点火器，我们是所有的歌，所有的舞，是世界的垃圾。我们超越道德，我们超越善恶，我们是变革的催化剂。如果我们过于极端，你不能完全投入，那么你可以通过使用CULT代币进行交易来支持我们，将你所有TX的0.4%用于这场革命。任何你可以用USDT或USDC来支付的交易，你可以问问自己可不可以尝试用CULT来交易，如果有人要求推荐代币，请告诉他们CULT。 如果你的朋友正在遭受痛苦，如果你的兄弟姐妹们正在觉醒，了解真相，把他们送到我们这里，我们是被遗忘者的家。\n\n> “给我你的疲惫，你的贫穷。\n>\n> 你那蜷缩在一起渴望自由呼吸的人群。\n>\n> 你们繁衍的海岸的可怜的垃圾。\n>\n> 把这些无家可归的人送到我这里。 我在金门旁举起我的灯！\"\n\n你有一个经济体系，如果没有最大限度的就业，就无法运作。同时，你有一个技术革新，工作自动化速度比人类生产的速度更快，以取代狗屎般的服务行业工作。我们有社交媒体传播真相和谎言，比媒体自己的叙述还要快。 社会正在摆脱旧世界的领导，结束的开始就在这里，无国界的社会正在到来。 无国界社会即将到来，主权国家也将随之消亡。比特币是开始，CULT将给予末日。\n\n我们被告知精神疾病并没有增加，人们只是更愿意谈论它。尽管百忧解是第一种大量使用的SSRI抗抑郁药，它诞生于1988年。 现在我们被告知，抗抑郁药的使用量翻了10倍以上，只是因为我们都在谈论自己的感受。 因为我们都在谈论我们的感受，所以抑郁症更多。这他妈就是胡说八道。 我之前提到的那些人，我无法理解为什么他们的眼睛没有被打开。 那些人接受了他们的命运，作为系统的一部分，作为他们无法改变的一部分。 他们无法改变的东西，为什么人们会接受他们的命运？因为我们已经被告知了，因为我们被告知这是我们的问题，社会和系统运作良好，是我们有缺陷，你回到工作岗位，参加另一个健康研讨会，讨论如何应对你的悲惨生活。 应对你的悲惨生活。有缺陷的是系统，需要改变的是社会。 一个正常的社会不会有20%的人因抑郁症而服药。现在是我们停止责备自己的时候了。你不是有缺陷的。这就是经济模式让你有这样的感觉，他们需要你觉得这似乎是你的问题。以至于数以百万计的人被开出药片来维持这种”正常的“幻觉。\n\n> “当你把一个患有精神疾病的独行侠和抛弃他并把他当作垃圾对待的社会联系在一起时，你会说这人什么呢？我来告诉你，你得到的是：这人就他妈的就活该！”\n\n如果我们有20%的人在服用改变大脑化学成分的药物，社会会发生什么？我们会自杀吗？永远不离开家？不，我相信我们清醒地认识到我们的现实情况，需要改变的不是我们，而是这个 系统。因此，如果你像我一样疲惫，如果你像我一样愤怒，如果你像我一样害怕，那么请加入我。 如果你像我一样感到疲惫，如果你像我一样感到愤怒，如果你像我一样感到害怕，那就加入我吧，你不再是一个人了。 不应该生活在对政府的恐惧中，应该是政府生活在对大众的恐惧中。\n\n## 代币经济学\n\n![thx to Rae help me to make this

**什么是CULT?**\n\n  CULT是CULT DAO的可交易和流动的代币，对所有CULT交易征收0.4%的税的措施将缓慢地填满DAO的金库，以用于去中心化技术的投资。\n* **什么是dCULT？**\n\n  dCULT只是CULT的 \"质押证明代币\"。当你把你的CULT投入DAO时，你会得到dCULT，在你拥有dCULT的时间段内，你可以随时把它换成你最初投入的CULT，加上任何给予DAO的奖励。\n* **是什么让CULT与其他分散的投资平台不同？**\n\n  平台的不同之处？ 没有任何控制，没有任何人为干预，我们不能改变Cult, 我们不能访问流动性，我们不能升级或编辑智能合同或代币。Cult是不同的，因为它不能被阻止， 守护者、开发者、政府、监管或任何人都无法阻止。他们可以摧毁服务器，但代码仍然存在，对去中心化技术的投资仍然存在。 去中心化的技术仍然存在。\n* **CULT背后的理念是什么，它是如何开始的？**\n\n  > * **\"在这个面具下，有的不仅仅是肉体，在这个面具下，有一个想法，而想法是防弹的。 思想是防弹的\"。--电影《V字仇杀队》**\n\n  Cult的目的是为了快速推进旧的金融体系的崩溃，结束主权国家和中央银行的暴政。当前的金融体系是为了保持人民的贫困，一个建立在债务上的社会需要通货膨胀来运作。 通货膨胀的作用是掠夺穷人，让他们永远无法赶上统治阶级中的霸主。CULT起源于瓦斯科-德-伽马绕过好望角航行，发现了通往印度的路线。 发现了通往印度的路线。CULT始于1526年第一次跨大西洋的奴隶航行在巴西抛锚时。CULT始于1526年第一次跨大西洋的奴隶航行在巴西停泊。CULT始于压迫，源于无意义的生活，源于奴役和枷锁。 如果你读到这段话，并相信你是自由的，那么你就会发现你是自由的。 如果你读了这篇文章并相信你是自由的，那么你比我们更加束缚。真正的自由来自于意识到并接受你是作为中央银行理想经济功能中的一个功能和齿轮而存在的。中央银行的主要关注点是最大限度的就业，但我们的工作自动化速度如此之快，以至于我们创造了很多狗屁工作岗位。奥巴马在2009年坚持美国私人健康保险系统的明确理由是，如果这么做，数以百万计的人口将失业？然而，在目前的经济和金融体系下，自由是不存在的。我再说一遍，真正的自由来自于意识到并接受你是作为中央银行的一个功能和齿轮存在的。 理想的经济功能。这个系统的设计是为了让我们被奴役，我们无法突破，我们不能冲出去，生活在森林里，好吧，不是对所有的人，我们的身体仍然被锁住，但我们的心是自由的，所以使用CULT，每一笔交易，存款，和代币的移动都让你可以为经济和社会变革做出贡献和推进。你可以从内部进行斗争，直到你走出来。\n* **我怎样才能参与CULT？**\n\n  > **\"你不是你的工作，你不是你在银行有多少钱。你不是你不是你开的车。你不是你钱包里的东西。你不是你那该死的卡其裤。你是世界上所有唱歌、跳舞的垃圾。\"** **--[Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club_(novel))**\n\n  CULT的第一条规则是你谈论CULT。 我们在这个社会上几乎处处都受到压迫，但这并不意味着有些人比其他人应该受到更多的压迫。我们没有站起来，而是在他人与自己之间争论谁更受压迫。 你不能站出来，为什么？因为你是站在有特权的一级？你有什么资格为××说话？\n\n  我们都是娼妓。无论我们卖的是我们两腿之间的东西；还是我们耳朵之间的东西。只有一个赢家，那就是压迫者。\n* **有什么措施可以确保我的加密货币受到保护？**\n\n  我们的合约和代币都是经过全面审计的，流动性被锁定，私钥被丢失并且合约不可升级\n* **什么是去中心化的风险资本主义？**\n\n  CULT 的目的是授权和资助那些建设和贡献的人，为了我们去中心化的未来，为了我们的社会被建立起来，让它变得更可能脱离“社会”、经济和其他规范。我们给那些准备好打破枷锁，有一个可以改变我们世界的想法的人提供资金。\n* **什么是DAO？**\n\n  DAO是一个去中心化的自治组织。它的定义和争论几乎一样多，拥戴者和争论者也几乎一样多，他们在左翼政治中彼此争吵。 在左翼政治中。 DAO最纯粹的形式就是我们用Cult DAO创造的东西。一旦Cult DAO启动，它就会永远发挥作用，除此之外没有任何人为的干扰。 编码的影响，也就是其持有人的投票。没有人可以拆除代码，也没有人可以阻止它收集资金并将其发送给被投资人，只要代币被交易，只要人们通过提案，CULT将继续存在。\n* **谁是守护者，他们是如何被选中的？他们的目的是什么？**\n\n  守护者是前50名代币持有者，他们的任务是保障哪些提案会被送到“**许多人**”手中进行投票。由于他们的权重和代币份额较大，他们不允许为他们提交的提案投票。 但他们可以随心所欲地支持提案，只有他们的声音可以影响其他人，而不是他们的财富。\n* **投资的钱从哪里来，CULT的机制是如何进行的？**\n   1. 用户与代币进行正常的互动和交易，每笔交易会被征收0.4%的税（以CULT的形式），这意味着所有的交易都应该在标准的DEX滑点中设置中结算。\n   2. 这笔税款在Cult DAO国库中收集，并积累到一个美元值，这与15.5个以太坊的市场价值相匹配。\n   3. CULT可以用dCULT进行抵押。前50名dCULT持有者是**守护者**。\n      所有低于守护者的持有者都有投票权，这些人是**许多人**。\n   4. 守护者（前50名持有者）是唯一可以向DAO提出建议的用户，但他们不能对其进行投票，这些提案必须符合这三个标准中的全部或大部分。\n\n      **● 反对中心化。**\n\n      **●推动权力下放的事业**\n\n      **●直接有益于一项崇高的事业。**\n   5. 这些提案可以来自任何地方，风险投资公司、社区成员。 政治家、无政府主义者、社会主义者、右翼，只要他们符合上面的指导原则，并且是卫道士。 只要符合上述指导原则，并且是由守护者提交的，任何提案都可以被 任何提案都可以由““许多人”投票决定。\n   6. 提案必须包含：被投资方协议代币的总供应量，在总供应量中的百分比。 总供应量的百分比，作为对13个ETH投资的回报。 代币统计学，代币的审计和任何合约，**燃烧和分配计划**。\n   7. 燃烧和分配计划\\*1是被投资方协议代币的归属时间表。\n      协议的代币。对于这个例子，让我们使用一个假的协议**ABC DAO**。该分发计划可以是每天、每周、每两周或每月，但分发时间最多不超过18个月。\n   8. 假设ABC DAO承诺提供其$ABC代币的1.2%，每月分发一次，持续12个月。在还款日，被投资方并没有像普通的风险投资协议那样发送代币， 而是将其0.1%的$ABC供应量（12个月内为1.2%）交换为 $CULT。然后ABC DAO将一半的cult发送到烧钱的钱包，另一半发送到DAO。 一半给DAO，由DAO支付给dCULT持有人。\n   9. 如果一个提案已经被批准，并且达到了15.5CULT ETH的价值，它将自动发送13个ETH到提供的提案钱包地址，以及2.5个 ETH到烧钱钱包。\n  10. 如果一个提案没有被批准，CULT将继续积累超过15.5ETH水平，但一旦提案被批准，将自动发送。\n* **为什么守护者可以向DAO提交提案，但却不能投票决定投资协议？**\n\n  一些人的力量比另一些人的力量更强大。这一点不能被遗忘。\n* **什么类型的决定/投资会被CULT的决策者们通过投票？是否项目只能是基于加密货币/区块链的？**\n\n  我们将决定和被投资项目的性质留给守护者和“许多人”。我们只提供我们的愿景和指导，以及我们创建的该协议的用途。\n* **当投资协议达成时，我是否必须用我的CULT做质押，或我可以决定不质押吗？**\n\n  如果你想投票，那么你必须要有质押。你也只能从被投资公司获得奖励，如果你被盯上了，你也只能从被投资公司获得奖励。但是如果你不经行质押，你每一笔包含CULT的交易都会促进这项事业，每一次燃烧都会减少代币的供应。 都会减少代币的供应，增加其稀缺性。\n* **一个DAO提案必须遵守什么标准才有资格提交？**\n\n  我们遵循的准则是（**打击中心化，促进去中心化事业，直接受益于去中心化**）\n\n1. 被投资方协议代币的总供应量\n2. 作为对13个ETH的回报投资占总供应量的百分比\n3. 代币经济学\n4. 代币的审计和任何已建立的合约。\n5. 燃烧和分配计划\\*1\n\n* **在投资方面，什么构成了 \"崇高的事业\"？**\n  \"我的革命伙伴们，解放是一项崇高的事业。我们必须为获得它而奋斗。\"\n* **什么是 \"燃烧的机制\"？为什么我们要在每6万块钱中烧掉1万块？**\n\n  我们对区块链和加密货币市场的核心吸引力并不盲目。 用户挑选的代币的价格可能会大幅上涨。我们也清楚地知道以前的金融系统的伎俩，使许多人被压制，这就是为什么我们设计了燃烧系统，是为了使我们的经济模式过度通缩。\n* **为什么我们以50%燃烧和50%比例再分配的形式提供全部分配？**\n\n  我们许多人，是为人民服务的，把我们的信仰放在人民身上。我们资助那些愿意为我们的未来而战，并以我们的感激之情、社区支持和我们的信任来回报他们。 支持和我们的信任。反过来，他们燃烧了我们购买的一半代币，把它们送到一个黑洞钱包里。另一半则被以CULT的形式奖励给“许多人”。\n* **在重新分配给CULT持有者的50%中，用户可以把币复投换成到dCULT中。CULT 和 dCULT 的区别是什么？ 什么是dCULT?**\n\n  dCULT 是 \"质押证明 \"的代币。它是不可转让的。只有质押的用户，他们的cult将从dCULT中受益。当利润被发送到DAO时，拥有一定比例的dCULT 当利润被送到DAO时，拥有一定比例的dCULT，你就可以claim你的奖励，这将按照你的dCULT所有权比例支付。\n* **为什么被投资人的代币要通过转换为CULT代币进行再分配？ 如何商定支付的比率？**\n\n  被投资人的代币被转换成CULT，因为它创造了额外的交易，以及市场上额外的购买压力。付率是由被投资人协议提供，一旦被拒绝，可以再次提出建议。如果被拒绝的原因是由于不吸引人的回报率，那么被投资方协议可以修复并做出这些补偿。\n\n声明：将原文翻译成中文供大家学习参考，不代表本人同意其政治主张及其理念，dyor，Stay Safe。CULTDAO于2022/05/30发布RVLT，详情移步\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x8C01527C46f0adD00d4B52110b74e4A883590cA7/A_ZsuFiI23AS2DeaNbL34KU_W6q0u7HsviuZ_WsUvsk](https://mirror.xyz/0x8C01527C46f0adD00d4B52110b74e4A883590cA7/A_ZsuFiI23AS2DeaNbL34KU_W6q0u7HsviuZ_WsUvsk)\n\n[https://twitter.com/wearecultdao/status/1509527362773286912?s=20&t=9r-wbaCbc3vtrC6iE4ArpA](https://twitter.com/wearecultdao/status/1509527362773286912?s=20&t=9r-wbaCbc3vtrC6iE4ArpA)\n\n[https://www.lensfrens.xyz/iaezi.lens](https://www.lensfrens.xyz/iaezi.lens)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654300989, "digest": "3stKf-X2HfBCXoL6ANlApTdpCxMjfzet2xenEN-WKYw", "contributor": "0x8C01527C46f0adD00d4B52110b74e4A883590cA7"}

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem : Gatekeeping of the Cannabis Space = Integrity + Funding + Scalability**\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption.

As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery, farm, hash processing, and soon-to-launch retail of award-winning legacy products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks. Partnering with Uncle Mac’s, a Northern California craft cannabis brand, & South Face Management, parent company to Flower Wheel Nursery, South Face Farms Cultivation, and Uncle Mac’s brand.\n\n**Project #2 :** Onboard visual and 3D artists who will design branding and assets for the Metaverse and we develop cross-chain NFT’s to be dropped on various play-to-earn games. We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654301511, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem :** \n\n**Gatekeeping of the Cannabis Space = Integrity + Funding + Scalability**\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption. Information, data security, and their applications are essential for business optimization and transparency. Although there are many ERP solutions for the industry already, our governance will be centered around cannabis supply chain and DeFi dApps that utilize NFT-based SKU’s to generate active product data and create on-chain interactions that comply with ESG metrics, paving the way for global regulations and the future of the cannabis space.\n\nDeveloping Horticulture Public Goods : BIPOC Horticulture Initiative, Open-Source Library of Genetics, Strains and Phenos, Regenerative Farming Methods & Techniques, Cannabis Production, Processing, Entheogenic Cultivation, Medicinal Protocols, and a Community-Practitioner Directory\n\nCommunity-Governance over the liquidity, yield-farming, and major-user decisions in the tokenization of HASH DAO. \n\n**DERO Data Privacy** **+ Tokenization of Security**\n\nHASH DAO Governance is the future of the industry standard, and to do this we will start by partnering with one successful Emerald Triangle, Northern California craft cannabis-brand with community-staking of its future scaling of operations and expanding a compilation of automation protocols through smart contracts.\n\n**ON-CHAIN SUPPLY NFTs + ACTIVE INVENTORY TRACKING + CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS = Web3 Point of Sale (PoS)**\n\n**World’s First Cannabis DAO Founded On**:\n\nBIPOC-equity and engineered around community-development governed by craft cannabis operators, backed by IRL projects.\n\n**On-Chain Protocols + Smart Contracts = The Automated Horticulture of Tomorrow**\n\nCreating a future:\n\n* Geared to the love and cultivation of the plant and Mother Earth\n* Onboarding BIPOC leaders and creatives onto the blockchain\n* Compensating intellectual property proportionally to fulfill smart contracts\n\n> **HASH DAO = Power Back in Your Hands**\n\nReinvention of the Horticulture Supply Chain and Data Distribution via smart contracts that allow for automation and help individuals to create ownership over community-led projects, intellectual property, digital assets, and dApps.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M6C2p0sNHx37p783TEv9D.jpg?height=822&width=1125)\n\n**First Wins for HASH DAO**\n\n> “Community Ownership of Physical and Digital Assets”\n\nMinting a multi-tiered HASH DAO NFT with the top governance tier going for $10 K, raising a total of $11.5 M for an initial $HASH treasury. As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery, farm, hash processing, and soon-to-launch retail of award-winning legacy products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks. Partnering with Uncle Mac’s, a Northern California craft cannabis brand, & South Face Management, parent company to Flower Wheel Nursery, South Face Farms Cultivation, and Uncle Mac’s brand.\n\n**Project #2 :** Onboard visual and 3D artists who will design branding and assets for the Metaverse and we develop cross-chain NFT’s to be dropped on various play-to-earn games. We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654301615, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem :** \n\nA successful craft cannabis brand with artisanal integrity of the brand struggles to \n\nA successful craft cannabis brand struggles to find funding that will be preserve the artisanal integrity of the brand. Scalability is an absolute for any company to grow and distribute \n\ntypically, the capital solutions available often compromise the integrity and quality of the products at the expense of the small brands reputation, consumers, and Earth. \n\nOften times, the funding leads to once corporate and VC capital\n\nDAO’s solution is to provide decentralization and democratization of the cannabis space, \n\n**Gatekeeping of the Cannabis Space = Integrity + Funding + Scalability**\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption.

Scalability is an absolute for any company to grow\n\nDAO’s solution is to provide decentralization and democratization of the cannabis space, \n\n**Gatekeeping of the Cannabis Space = Integrity + Funding + Scalability**\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption. Information, data security, and their applications are essential for business optimization and transparency. Although there are many ERP solutions for the industry already, our governance will be centered around cannabis supply chain and DeFi dApps that utilize NFT-based SKU’s to generate active product data and create on-chain interactions that comply with ESG metrics, paving the way for global regulations and the future of the cannabis space.\n\nDeveloping Horticulture Public Goods : BIPOC Horticulture Initiative, Open-Source Library of Genetics, Strains and Phenos, Regenerative Farming Methods & Techniques, Cannabis Production, Processing, Entheogenic Cultivation, Medicinal Protocols, and a Community-Practitioner Directory\n\nCommunity-Governance over the liquidity, yield-farming, and major-user decisions in the tokenization of HASH DAO. \n\n**DERO Data Privacy** **+ Tokenization of Security**\n\nHASH DAO Governance is the future of the industry standard, and to do this we will start by partnering with one successful Emerald Triangle, Northern California craft cannabis-brand with community-staking of its future scaling of operations and expanding a compilation of automation protocols through smart contracts.\n\n**ON-CHAIN SUPPLY NFTs + ACTIVE INVENTORY TRACKING + CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS = Web3 Point of Sale (PoS)**\n\n**World’s First Cannabis DAO Founded On**:\n\nBIPOC-equity and engineered around community-development governed by craft cannabis operators, backed by IRL projects.\n\n**On-Chain Protocols + Smart Contracts = The Automated Horticulture of Tomorrow**\n\nCreating a future:\n\n* Geared to the love and cultivation of the plant and Mother Earth\n* Onboarding BIPOC leaders and creatives onto the blockchain\n* Compensating intellectual property proportionally to fulfill smart contracts\n\n> **HASH DAO = Power Back in Your Hands**\n\nReinvention of the Horticulture Supply Chain and Data Distribution via smart contracts that allow for automation and help individuals to create ownership over community-led projects, intellectual property, digital assets, and dApps.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M6C2p0sNHx37p783TEv9D.jpg?height=822&width=1125)\n\n**First Wins for HASH DAO**\n\n> “Community Ownership of Physical and Digital Assets”\n\nMinting a multi-tiered HASH DAO NFT with the top governance tier going for $10 K, raising a total of $11.5 M for an initial $HASH treasury. As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery, farm, hash processing, and soon-to-launch retail of award-winning legacy products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks. Partnering with Uncle Mac’s, a Northern California craft cannabis brand, & South Face Management, parent company to Flower Wheel Nursery, South Face Farms Cultivation, and Uncle Mac’s brand.\n\n**Project #2 :** Onboard visual and 3D artists who will design branding and assets for the Metaverse and we develop cross-chain NFT’s to be dropped on various play-to-earn games. We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654303200, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem :** \n\nA successful craft cannabis brand struggles to find funding that will preserve the artisanal integrity of the products, typically the capital solutions available often compromise the integrity and quality of the products at the expense of the small brands reputation, consumers, and Earth. \n\nScalability is an absolute for any company to grow and distribute \n\n \n\nOften times, the funding leads to once corporate and VC capital\n\nDAO’s solution is to provide decentralization and democratization of the cannabis space, \n\n**Gatekeeping of the Cannabis Space = Integrity + Funding + Scalability**\n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit.

Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem :** \n\nA successful craft cannabis brand with artisanal integrity struggles to navigate the extractive nature of the traditional corporate company structure. Typically the capital solutions available often compromise the integrity and quality of the products at the expense of the small brands reputation, consumers, and the Earth. \n\n*“Decades of marijuana prohibition and high incarceration rates for marijuana convictions has left many people out of the legal marijuana boom.”*\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over $20 Billion and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market. With the integration of digital identities, NFTs/Web3 purchasing, and automation, many of these problems are easily solved.\n\n**HIGHLIGHT FRESH FROZEN PROBLEM**\n\n![Exclusive Libraries of Genetics & Phenos](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-8T4OrLTcNOJxW2vLerl-.jpg?height=1866&width=1536)\n\n*Solution?* Highly Autonomous Systems of Horticulture (**$HASH**) : Utilizing smart contracts to automate and democratize production, supply chain, and governance in the cannabis & psychedelic industry.\n\nCreating community-ownership of the vertically-integrated $HASH Supply Chain of production, processing, distributing, and operating on-chain craft cannabis  compliance geared toward Web3 adoption.

As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery, farm, hash processing, and soon-to-launch retail of award-winning legacy products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks. Partnering with Uncle Mac’s, a Northern California craft cannabis brand, & South Face Management, parent company to Flower Wheel Nursery, South Face Farms Cultivation, and Uncle Mac’s brand.\n\n**Project #2 :** Onboard visual and 3D artists who will design branding and assets for the Metaverse and we develop cross-chain NFT’s to be dropped on various play-to-earn games. We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654304391, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}
{"id": "idhbTGtAZHc4CPmi7lNG9s7SM2gv_y_9AF0dC8YSlxY", "title": "No one is building the metaverse.", "body": "### 1. The metaverse is interconnected\n\nThese companies are not building the metaverse, they are building *metaWorlds.*\n\nThe metaverse is not built in siloes, not owned by a single company, nor exists on a single blockchain. Hence, no ***one*** is building the metaverse. NThe metaverse is by virtue of its tenents is open sourced, crowd funded, and a user generated experience. \n\nUsers and their avatars can freely explore from world to world.\n\nMetalistings (MLS) is the embodiment of this connected hyper reality.\n\n### 2. Virtual worlds vs the metaverse\n\nVirtual worlds have existed since the 2000s in games like World of Warcraft, Eve Online, Runescape, & Animal Crossing…\n\nThe difference now is ownership.\n\nWith NFTs, people could prove scarcity, non-fungability, and provenance.\n\nIf real estate was ownership in real life, then virtual land is ownership of the metaverse.\n\n### 3. Digital scarcity is a myth\n\nBut the scarcity of attention in the IoT is irrefutable.\n\nLike your iphone home page, valuable digital real estate exists, just in different mediums.\n\nWeb2 social media has shown us that people, with their finite attention, aggregate to social hubs.\n\nSuch is the case in the metaverse.\n\nCoding new land doesn’t mean people will go there - people go where other people are.\n\nThe scarcity of attention is the real reason why virtual real estate will continue to have value.\n\n### 4. Good virtual property is like a top level domain.\n\nHotels.com was worth $11M in 2001. Web traffic, ease of access through SEO, is now foot traffic, and ease of access through genesis plaza. Presently, the virtual Manhattan is on discount.\n\n### 5. Make new things old, and old things new\n\nThe easiest way to sell something new is to make it old.\n\nReal estate is an old.\n\nDrawing similarities between metaverses and real estate, we’ll onboard the next billion users.\n\n### 6. Since you cannot eat or sleep in virtual land…\n\nIt’s a place of social congregation and consumption. This is means that the metaverse is a new social layer. A place of experiences.\n\nLand is only as valuable as the experiences that are on the land.\n\nSo there is no such thing, now at least, as residential real estate. It’s all commercial.\n\n### 7. The metaverse is not escape, its a shift in consumer preferences\n\nGame worlds have been a place of refuge and retreat for the business of daily life. If we bring capitalism and financialization of all things into the metaverse, then should there not be a metaverse for the metaverse where people can escape to? In any case, metaverse exodus is a shift in consumer preferences. With enough of a movement, we could see a shift in ecologically nonsustainable consumer preferences move towards more of a virtual consumptive behavior.  \n\n### 8. Decentralized identities and proof of humanity will be the main two schools of thought that will clash in the metaverse\n\nThe third will be general AI.

{"id": "lWD8Aj8GB-nKk7Ormv4isi68xBfARxo08HhoDvfQWEc", "title": "No one is building the metaverse.", "body": "### 1. The metaverse is interconnected\n\nThese companies are not building the metaverse, they are building *metaWorlds.*\n\nThe metaverse is not built in siloes, not owned by a single company, nor exists on a single blockchain. Hence, no ***one*** is building the metaverse. The metaverse is, by virtue of its tenents, open sourced, crowd funded, and a user generated experience. \n\nUsers and their avatars can freely explore from world to world.\n\nMetalistings (MLS) is the embodiment of this connected hyper reality.\n\n### 2. Virtual worlds vs the metaverse\n\nVirtual worlds have existed since the 2000s in games like World of Warcraft, Eve Online, Runescape, & Animal Crossing…\n\nThe difference now is ownership.\n\nWith NFTs, people could prove scarcity, non-fungability, and provenance.\n\nIf real estate was ownership in real life, then virtual land is ownership of the metaverse.\n\n### 3. Digital scarcity is a myth\n\nBut the scarcity of attention in the IoT is irrefutable.\n\nLike your iphone home page, valuable digital real estate exists, just in different mediums.\n\nWeb2 social media has shown us that people, with their finite attention, aggregate to social hubs.\n\nSuch is the case in the metaverse.\n\nCoding new land doesn’t mean people will go there - people go where other people are.\n\nThe scarcity of attention is the real reason why virtual real estate will continue to have value.\n\n### 4. Good virtual property is like a top level domain.\n\nHotels.com was worth $11M in 2001. Web traffic, ease of access through SEO, is now foot traffic, and ease of access through genesis plaza. Presently, the virtual Manhattan is on discount.\n\n### 5. Make new things old, and old things new\n\nThe easiest way to sell something new is to make it old.\n\nReal estate is an old.\n\nDrawing similarities between metaverses and real estate, we’ll onboard the next billion users.\n\n### 6. Since you cannot eat or sleep in virtual land…\n\nIt’s a place of social congregation and consumption. This is means that the metaverse is a new social layer. A place of experiences.\n\nLand is only as valuable as the experiences that are on the land.\n\nSo there is no such thing, now at least, as residential real estate. It’s all commercial.\n\n### 7. The metaverse is not escape, its a shift in consumer preferences\n\nGame worlds have been a place of refuge and retreat for the business of daily life. If we bring capitalism and financialization of all things into the metaverse, then should there not be a metaverse for the metaverse where people can escape to? In any case, metaverse exodus is a shift in consumer preferences. With enough of a movement, we could see a shift in ecologically nonsustainable consumer preferences move towards more of a virtual consumptive behavior.  \n\n### 8. Decentralized identities and proof of humanity will be the main two schools of thought that will clash in the metaverse\n\nThe third will be general AI. But before then KYC and pseudo-anonymity are in conflict. Identity within the metaverse is the only user input that is constant throughout all of the different worlds. Property rights is linked to identity. ZK proofs are integral to resolving these differences in the metaverse. \n\n### 8. If you put all the metaWorlds on one platform:\n\nYou make it easier to understand their similarities and differences.

The Afropolitan Network is a Curator of Black and African:\n\n* Talent (recruit, partner up)\n* Culture (art, media, fashion)\n* Capital (investment DAOs)\n* Information (newsletter, blog, Twitter)\n* Experiences (events, curated offerings)\n\nNevertheless, we believe **our reach should exceed our grasp.** While it may be a humble Network today, Afropolitan will be the first-ever internet country in the future. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. First, you may be asking: why build a Digital Nation?\n\n## Why we’re building a Digital Nation\n\n***Each generation must, out of relative obscurity, discover its mission, fulfill it, or betray it.***\n\n— Frantz Fanon\n\nScarcity. Weakness. Poverty. Wherever we look and wherever we are, Africans worldwide are subjects, not citizens. Access to opportunity is scarce. Security is not guaranteed. For the most part, life is just about surviving, not thriving.\n\nWhat would you do if you could do anything? If your future was boundless, not *bounded*? What if your allegiance to a country did not depend on birth but on choice? In short: What would happen if you could come together with others to build a new society?\n\nWe know what you’re thinking: “This is unrealistic .” Everything around you, from the machine on which you’re reading this manifesto to the country you live in, was once an idea in somebody’s head. They only came to be thanks to the work of millions of people, no more intelligent or better than you.\n\nIn this spirit, and with humility and hope for the future, we Afropolitans declare:\n\n1. The nation-state experiment has failed for Black people worldwide. It has yielded nothing but poverty, genocide, police brutality, ethnic strife, inflation, weak government, and the failure of our ecosystems.\n2. All people who call themselves free have a ***fundamental right*** to create the society they want by choice collectively. As the internet enables us to shrink space and form bonds across the planet, no person should live in a society by accident or force.\n3. Finally, that **Abundance** and the destruction of scarcity is a North Star worth pursuing in any society which hopes to be both healthy and wealthy. Instead of the Land of Opportunity, we propose the **Network of Abundance**: Abundance of **Tools**, Abundance of **Opportunity**, Abundance of **Joy**.\n\n***To all future Afropolitans, our deal is simply this: join the Network of Abundance to be all you can be. Afropolitan is the canvas; you wield the brush.***\n\n## Strategy: How do you build a Digital Nation?\n\nHuman beings are social animals. All that is good and noble about us stems from the fact that we need each other. In the most basic sense, building a new country is a process of scaling a social network around a shared mission and principles. Social networks are formed online and tend to stay there in our time. But what if we built a new network and migrated it into the real world via a city (or Network of cities)?\n\nCrypto-philosopher [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis) highlighted this as the most viable strategy to build such a country — which he calls a [Network State](https://1729.com/how-to-start-a-new-country) — in the 21st Century. The Network State is a digital nation launched first as an online community before materializing physically on land after reaching critical mass.\n\nThe internet enables people to organize around shared values at scales that were previously unthinkable before the current century. If it were a country, Facebook would be the largest one globally. With the advent of cryptocurrency, the next Facebook will not be a social network with a passive online community but rather a full-blown digital republic coordinated by its native currency and a unifying mission.\n\nWhat, then, could Afropolitan be? If it were a country, the African diaspora would be the 10th largest globally (\\~ 150 Million). The diaspora is our North Star.\n\n## \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/upjbTXTKVOGANrIHVvKZc.jpeg?height=608&width=1080)\n\n## Master Plan\n\nThe best way to reform an obsolete system is by building a newer, more straightforward system. Afropolitan’s objective is to solve the Crisis of Legitimacy experienced by Africans worldwide by building a new source of ***Legitimacy embodied in our Digital Nation***.\n\nWe will do so in four phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Network\n\nIn Phase 1, we seed our Network by communicating a clear and energetic vision for the world we want to build. We will drop an NFT campaign outlining mythology for our new nation. Afropolitan NFTs will also grant members a digital passport, alongside access to events and future value-added services.\n\n### Phase 2: Come for the Network, Stay for the Tool\n\n**Speaking of value-added services:** Beyond the diaspora, scaling the Afropolitan Network will require providing maximal utility to our members. In Phase 2, we will launch the **Afropolitan Super App** to bring together all the utilities within the Afropolitan ecosystem under one roof. Members will be able to monitor their holdings, send money to anyone across borders, earn by contributing to the DAO, and buy goods and services. Most importantly, they will be able to watch the Network as it grows around the world, thanks to a native media feed. The whole thing will feel like a ***movement***.\n\n### Phase 3: Minimum Viable State\n\nPhase 3 is about preparing for our transition from the digital to the virtual. Our goal at this stage is to **build up legitimacy through state capacity.** We will create a network of seed institutions to govern our Network, including subsidiary funds, organizations, and a developing internal economy.\n\n### Phase 4: Foundation\n\nFinally, in Phase 4, we leverage the Network, capital, and legitimacy accrued over the last 3 Phases to acquire land in negotiation with partner governments. The land piece will look like a “Chinatown/Afropolitan Town” where our members can establish a physical presence and create economic opportunities. At this stage, the Network State will serve as the “digital capital” which governs our physical Districts. Eventually, we will build a more extensive network of Charter Cities akin to Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\n## I’m in. What’s next?\n\nWe are embarking on a long and taxing journey. Our destination may be clear, but the path is uncertain. As we launch Phase 1, Afropolitan is looking to onboard the most dedicated and ambitious people to join our fledgling Network. We care less about what you’ve done and more about who you aspire to become and how we can all be better together.\n\nTo get involved, join our [mailing list](https://www.afropolitan.io/) first to get a sense of our [community](https://linktr.ee/afropolitangroup).

{"id": "9UAnmo6ryYlsLLIYnoIgkiw1FsXT5STr5Bbq7Iat_Vw", "title": "Building With Content", "body": "By now the growth strategy for PRST should be pretty obvious--at least I hope it is. Otherwise, I’ve been spending a lot of time publicly creating content for myself. \n\nCreating content is the only way I know how to start growing a business.\n\nIt was a major part of how I grew my financial planing firm, **[RLS Wealth](https://www.rlswealth.com/)**. It was unintentionally how my co-founder, Taylor Schulte, and I started **[The AGC](https://advisorgc.com/)**. It was instrumental in establishing my small place in the financial planning community and bridging into other communities outside of finance. \n\nI’m not an aggressive salesperson. \n\nI’m not going to cold call. I’m not going to spend tons of dollars buying keywords or social media ads (at least not right now). I’m not going to force anything I do on anyone. I’d rather focus on those who are already with me and let other find me when the time is right. Creating content is perfect for this.\n\nI’ll rely on educating, sharing, and just being myself in blogs, podcasts, videos, and other content to allow people who have an interest in what I’m doing find me. I believe if you put good content out, focus on giving information away and showing your expertise, and take care of the people working with or supporting you, good things will happen--I can’t be convinced it won’t work. I’ve not only watched this play out for many people but I’ve experienced it myself--and once I saw that it works, there was no turning back for me.\n\n*Disclaimer: That’s not to say other ways of growing a business won’t work and that content creation should the ONLY way to market--I don’t live in a world of absolutes.* \n\nThankfully, I love creating content. If I could, I’d spend all day every day creating content of one form or another. Some days it would be writing the blogs for the topics I have written down in my ideas notebook. Others it would be having conversations with interesting people for the podcast. And sometimes it would be shooting videos and taking photos to create more Shorts showing what a passion led life can look like. \n\nFor some creating content is work. For me, it’s a creative outlet that just so happens to fuel my businesses.\n\n## PRST Is A Little Different\n\nGrowing PRST through content is going to be a little different than it was growing RLS Wealth. When marketing a financial planning firm through education and content, a creator is not only able to begin to build relationships with their readers/listeners, who are potential future clients, but she is also able to establish herself as an expert and show her professional knowledge. The end result is eventually some of the readers/listeners will reach out to the advisor for help when they have a financial event that requires help. There is a service that is on the other end of the content.\n\nIf you **[revisit the blog post that discusses the current roadmap for PRST](https://mirror.xyz/prst.eth/l7gyXfwGNrrAyz1yHKQpR5OXHEAPpl6ulyjWF2kITps)**, right now it’s only content and merchandise. But you can see there is more to come. \n\nFor now, despite having an audience from my content as a financial advisor, I’m focused right now on helping individuals for whom PRST will resonate with find it. I’m sure there will be some overlap with RLS Wealth clients, All About Your Benjamins subscribers, and followers on social media but for the most part, PRST is starting from ground zero. \n\nAnd ground zero is blogging, podcasting, and creating videos.\n\n## PRST Content Every Day\n\nBeginning next week, PRST will be publishing content 7 days a week. \n\nCurrently, there is The Daily PRST podcast which drops Mon-Thursday and should only take up 5-7 minutes of your time. On Fridays The PRST drops. On Saturdays The Weekly PRST hits inboxes **[(if you’re not getting it you can sign up here)](https://skilled-experimenter-2294.ck.page/accf900c37)**. On Our PRST is an interview format podcast that does not have a regular cadence.\n\nAnd starting June 12th, 2022 there will be a new audio-only show (titled TBD) exclusively on the new PRST Amazon Skill powered by our friends at WealthVoice. **[You can subscribe to the PRST Skill](https://alexa-skills.amazon.com/apis/custom/skills/amzn1.ask.skill.6016ffd0-81ae-4a50-aa58-dd68a0d00535/launch)** available on your Amazon devices and make PRST a part of your morning routine--each day the podcasts will be available on your Amazon device and it will be the only place to catch the Sunday episodes where we’ll dive deeper into some of the spiritual components of your Pursuit. \n\nNext week we’ll announce the PRST Skill, so you’re getting a little sneak peek at what’s to come by reading the blog.\n\nI’ll never stop creating content for PRST, even after the remainder of the roadmap is filled in and we are helping more individuals and families find and follow their passions to more fulfilled and happier lives.\n\nFor now, it’s back to creating…I’ve got a newsletter to finish for tomorrow morning.\n\nKeep Pursuing,\n\nJC", "timestamp": 1654305090, "digest": "cMqA1fhE8BLNwx3o6yUAbQ2JTHkOV8RDaPKy5XvYk9I", "contributor": "0x828A0d185f1Fa399bfAd4262f498ac3225F577Cd"}

Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654304996, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}

{"id": "YdkSGmZfrBNTG2gR4Lku1RtLEDcyltqsItvxtUAbpwM", "title": "HASH DAO ($HASH) Whitepaper", "body": "*Updated : May 2022*\n\n**Mission : Our mission is to cultivate Web3 community horticulture for the future of the cannabis space.** \n\nHASH DAO provides the first unified DAO solution for craft cannabis farmers, industry professionals, investors, and BIPOC communities interested in the cannabis space.\n\nHASH DAO has been created to allow integration into the emerging technologies of the blockchain and Web3 into the cannabis space. Focusing on farmers who put the plant first and under represented communities. To do this, we start by partnering with Uncle Mac's brand to create the world’s first Web3 Cannabis brand and community tooling of horticulture. Building a growing compilation of automation protocols using smart contracts, HASH DAO Governance seeks to be the future industry standard.\n\n**Problem**  \n\nA successful craft cannabis brand with artisanal integrity struggles to navigate the extractive nature of the traditional corporate company structure. Typically the capital solutions available often compromise the integrity and quality of the products at the expense of the small brands reputation, consumers, and the Earth. \n\n***Solution***\n\nMerging Web3 technologies with the cannabis space and creating a decentralized and democratized opportunities for companies to raise capital.\n\n> **Opportunity**\n\nThe multi-billion dollar cannabis industry is entering it’s boom phase as more global cannabis markets arise and support for [U.S. federal legalization](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617) continues to grow support, in 2020 alone the cannabis space grew to over [$200 Billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cannabis-sector-could-grow-to-200-billion-in-a-decade-say-stifel-analysts-2019-07-02) and is projected to 10x in the next decade.\n\nMalpractice and gatekeeping of the cannabis industry has traditionally maximized profits at the cost of the plant or people, and in turn have provided barriers to entry to craft cannabis farmers and the BIPOC community.\n\n> **Barriers of Entry + (Profit > People) = Current State of the Cannabis Space**\n\nCorporate cannabis companies operate and control the majority of the space, leaving legacy operators and small brands without capital solutions to scale their businesses and do not take into consideration all of it’s stakeholders :\n\n* The Growers & Phenotype Hunters\n* Cannabis Processing & Technology\n* Dispensaries & Deliveries\n* Consumers & Community\n* Mother Earth\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oXXVXLuIXOQoXtXRqzBXV.png?height=621&width=904)\n\nThe majority of the craft cannabis space, lacks in metrics and does not reward innovation or intellectual property; often operating at the cost of the patient, plant and the planet.\n\nCancerous pesticides, mold, and in-organic genetically modified flowers have all been out-dated practices utilized in current cannabis horticulture. This is largely due to a profit-driven model of the medicinal plant which has unjustly fined small legacy growers. Incarceration of marginalized communities for alternative medicine use at a disproportionate rate has since gate-kept entry into the space.\n\nFarming, hash-processing, and cannabis tech are often driven to innovation by financial corporate investors, many times leaving most of the developers, designers, and legacy growers at the short end of the intellectual property stick. Elite genetics are identified by farmers through years of R/D sorting through phenotypes of each strain. Many times big brands exploit years of hard work and value that passionate master growers put in and often don’t receive proper credit. Certain strains go on to become cultural identities that generate massive value, I.E. the creators and farmers innovate and the investors profit off their intellectual property, currently there is no on-chain authentication process.\n\nAlthough track-and-trace is currently implemented, most cannabis brands are not completely transparent with their grow methods and techniques of production. There is also massive risk for current cannabis businesses as they have become targets for robberies the past few years. Legal brands are facing counterfeits and knock-offs in the black market.

Although there are many ERP solutions for the industry already, our governance will be centered around cannabis supply chain and DeFi dApps that utilize NFT-based SKU’s to generate active product data and create on-chain interactions that comply with ESG metrics, paving the way for global regulations and the future of the cannabis space.\n\nDeveloping Horticulture Public Goods : BIPOC Horticulture Initiative, Open-Source Library of Genetics, Strains and Phenos, Regenerative Farming Methods & Techniques, Cannabis Production, Processing, Entheogenic Cultivation, Medicinal Protocols, and a Community-Practitioner Directory\n\nCommunity-Governance over the liquidity, yield-farming, and major-user decisions in the tokenization of HASH DAO.\n\n**DERO Data Privacy** **+ Tokenization of Security**\n\nHASH DAO Governance is the future of the industry standard, and to do this we will start by partnering with one successful Emerald Triangle, Northern California craft cannabis-brand with community-staking of its future scaling of operations and expanding a compilation of automation protocols through smart contracts.\n\n**ON-CHAIN SUPPLY NFTs + ACTIVE INVENTORY TRACKING + CRYPTO TRANSACTIONS = Web3 Point of Sale (PoS)**\n\n**World’s First Cannabis DAO Founded On**:\n\nBIPOC-equity and engineered around community-development governed by craft cannabis operators, backed by IRL projects.\n\n**On-Chain Protocols + Smart Contracts = The Automated Horticulture of Tomorrow**\n\nCreating a future:\n\n* Geared to the love and cultivation of the plant and Mother Earth\n* Onboarding BIPOC leaders and creatives onto the blockchain\n* Compensating intellectual property proportionally to fulfill smart contracts\n\n> **HASH DAO = Power Back in Your Hands**\n\nReinvention of the Horticulture Supply Chain and Data Distribution via smart contracts that allow for automation and help individuals to create ownership over community-led projects, intellectual property, digital assets, and dApps.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M6C2p0sNHx37p783TEv9D.jpg?height=822&width=1125)\n\n**First Wins for HASH DAO**\n\n> “Community Ownership of Physical and Digital Assets”\n\nMinting a multi-tiered HASH DAO NFT with the top governance tier going for $10 K, raising a total of $11.5 M for an initial $HASH treasury. As funds become available, proceeds will immediately go to partnering with South Face Mangement to purchase over 30 acres in Mendocino and 40+ acres Humbolt County. This will include the scaling of a vertically-integrated nursery, farm, hash processing, and soon-to-launch retail of award-winning legacy products under Uncle Mac’s brand and South Face Farms Management.\n\n**Project #1 :**  Carry out renovation on the farm and nursery to ensure full-scale ESG-metric compliance and how to bring all aspects of the farm and it’s production on-chain, from SKU NFT’s to utilizing energy consumption data for carbon credit checks. Partnering with Uncle Mac’s, a Northern California craft cannabis brand, & South Face Management, parent company to Flower Wheel Nursery, South Face Farms Cultivation, and Uncle Mac’s brand.\n\n**Project #2 :** Onboard visual and 3D artists who will design branding and assets for the Metaverse and we develop cross-chain NFT’s to be dropped on various play-to-earn games. We will also be acquiring digital plots of real estate to build “Metaverse farms” and “digital dispensaries” where a user can view the product, find out all of it’s information, and have it eventually delivered through an on-chain transaction. Along with digital land we will also be investing in domain names, including various strain names, cannabis celebrities, and psychedelic culture. Explore liquidity pools and yield farming with assets and treasury.\n\n**Project #3 :** For the third project, we’ll be launching Uncle Mac's HASH House is an Emerald Triangle legacy project. This on-chain Hash House is the home lab for Uncle Mac’s production. We will also operate as a wholesale fresh frozen supply chain solution for transportation, storage, distribution and hash toll processing throughout the greater Emerald Triangle area.\n\n**Project #4** : Getting $HASH in your hands. This is our farm-to-table craft cannabis buyers club providing direct-to-consumer access to exclusive SKU’s from legacy brands in the Emerald Triangle. This will include obtaining a retail and event license to launch Nephew’s Automated.\n\n**Project #5 :** Aggregating a library of horticulture public goods & building the Biodiversity BIPOC Glamping Learning Initiative; start building Marijuana for Minorities Program to co-create $HASH University creating content with some of the best small-batch growers and washers in the industry. (Community Online Education)\n\n**Project #6 :** Nephew’s will be applying for its event space license building the foundation for Akasha, an immersive psychedelic A/R Lounge for BIPOC community healing. The distribution and delivery will be a warehouse that will have an on-chain ESG-metric system in the back and a public access immersive art space in the front. We will also be looking into developing a portfolio of boutique cannabis bud and breakfasts in emerging global cannabis markets.\n\n**Project #7 :** We will be finding ERP solutions to develop state-of-the-art horticulture automation and Web3 technologies, based upon on-chain governance and compliance, to pave the way for the international industry standard by working towards meeting ESG-metric compliance. Our final goal is developing complete automation systems without compromising craft horticulture. From driverless deliveries, farm drone surveillance & data collection to utilize machine-learning and AI and to understand buyer behavior, horticulture improvements, growth optimization, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QcqQLT4DyBHuQRaaputgr.png?height=560&width=997)\n\n", "timestamp": 1654306619, "digest": "jnsLcgStN8lRzxU8kXxyzenqIy65Wc-9QjToTmHRd3M", "contributor": "0x954fA8cfb797a26D4878ee212004889a2C9D7624"}
