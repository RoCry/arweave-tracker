In the time since the provenance hash for Otherdeed NFT collection [was first written to the contract](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe3af78b358819e12ab1bee608e7e480e7897df3003b2afe754e8619f4205b113), three corrections have been made to the collection metadata, necessitating an update of the original hash on-chain. A summary of the corrections and instructions on how to compute the Otherdeed collection provenance on your own are below.\n\n## Summary of Metadata Corrections\n\n1. Due to a bug in the script used to generate the collection metadata, the `Rugged Pickaxe` artifact was incorrectly omitted from the metadata for Otherdeed NFTs that correctly depicted the artifact in the NFT image. This was updated shortly after the reveal.\n2. The `Stone Hole Jackson` Koda body type from the original Otherdeed collection metadata has been updated to `Stone Holes`. This was missed by the several rounds of audits by sensitivity readers.\n3. Due to developer oversight, a typo was included in the`Octo Tentaclenotinfinalcollection` Koda attribute, it is now `Octo Tentacle`\n\n## Verifying the Otherdeed Collection Provenance\n\nThe raw Otherdeed collection metadata as well as a Ruby script to reproduce the provenance hash are available [in this open source GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yuga-labs/land_provenance).", "timestamp": 1658273148, "digest": "3OhsFmFx9bq57rBixtKb0ekvDrlQjjpGuwidgJUB-dA", "contributor": "0xEc9f53fA69682833FBd760C104B5D61aE29221E0"}

This included experience and views from DAOs, other decentralised networks, the co-operative movement, Indigenous cultures, purpose-led business, and civic and systems innovation.\n\nWe explored perspectives on the essential functions and attributes of governance, and the design implications for governance arrangements that seek to foster decentralisation, pluralism, and regeneration.\n\nEach of the conversations were framed around a question (click the links to listen to a recording of the conversation):\n\n1. **June 2, 2022:** [Metagovernance -

Products need to move onto L2 networks\n2. Exchanges need to provide cheap on-ramps directly to L2\n3.

This was very clear in the “DeFi summer” of 2020, and the NFT explosion in 2021. Transaction fees became too expensive and it priced people out. Eventually, only whales could afford to make profitable trades in DeFi, and only large speculators would mint Yuga Labs NFTs in 2021.\n\n# Exchanges need to provide cheap on-ramps directly to L2 (for a few cents)\n\nWe shouldn’t expect users to buy ETH and bridge to L2. Users need to purchase L2 tokens directly from exchanges with fiat, and then send them cheaply into the L2 networks so that they can use those products. We should look at apps like Coinbase to help onboard users to L2. \n\n# Products and specifically wallets need to abstract L2 networks\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether someone uses MasterCard or Visa these days. All of the payment processors can handle either and they abstract the differences. The same thing needs to happen with L2 networks, and it’s likely the wallets the need to take on this task.\n\nDifferent products will launch on different L2s. It’ll be messy if we expect users to navigate all of the different L2s, and so wallets (Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, Argent, etc) need to abstract the L2s and provide ways to bridge between them seamlessly.

I tak rozumcie zk.money bo coś w tym jest. 😜\n\n \n Od razu napiszę, że nie mam się za jakiegoś GURU. Napiszę to co wiem, a wiem pewnie troszkę więcej niż ty ziom. Postaram się pisać językiem abyś mnie zrozumiał.  \n Jest to też potencjalna spekulacja. Większość osób ma oczy skierowane w kierunku **#StarkNet**. Ja zwykle stoję z boku i obserwuję podobne protokoły, które mają mniejszy socialhype i fajnie się rozwijają. Dlatego dziś będzie o zk.money a nie o StarkNet.\n\n## zk.money - warstwa 2 na ETH skupiona na prywatności 👀\n\n[zk.money](https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork) to dApps do ochrony prywatności w warstwie 2 umożliwiająca użytkownikom prywatne przesyłanie **$ETH, $DAI & $renBTC** ( renBTC *był w v1 ale v2 obecnie off - wróci, spokojnie*). Zk.Money jest zbudowane na silniku [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) (*Zk-Rollup na Eth)*.  \n Aztec jest porównywalny do [zkSync](https://medium.com/@CalendarDefi/airdrop-guide-zksync-zigzag-a83ef3b33b70), ale koncentruje się na prywatności, której w #zkSync brak imo.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XME4s721Yez0zhziC8YLK.png?height=891&width=2545)\n\n**Podam prosty przykład anonimowej wysyłki $ETH :**\n\n* **Deponujesz** *(shield) *$ETH **lub** $DAI z mainetu na **zk-money L2 \n **\n* Znając **alias *(login)*** drugiej osoby wysyłasz jej $ETH lub $Dai po L2 (sobie, delerowi, whatever). Koszt transakcji bardzo niski (L2). Dzięki technologi **zero-knowledge proof** druga strona otrzyma ETH, ale nie będzie wiadomo od kogo. Co ciekawsze ty jako wysyłający masz dostęp do potwierdzenia, że transakcja pochodzi od Ciebie (gdyby zaszła taka potrzeba to, to potwierdzisz).  \n **Nikt inny nie ma do tego dostępu bez twojego walletu!**  \n \n* Gdy zamiast aliasu odbiorcy podasz adres ethereum środki zostaną wysłane na mainet. I ten przykład w moim przypadku ma utility w kwestiach spekulacji & sybilu na multiwalletach. Rozumiesz schemat prawda? Ahhh, jak ja dużo Ci mówię…🤫\n\n## Dobra spekulancie, wiem co interesuje Cię najbardziej… Co ja tam mam robić niby, co?🤫\n\n[Zk.Money](https://zk.money/) i sieć [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) działają już na mainecie. Ani jedno, ani drugie nie ma jeszcze tokena. Czy będzie ? Czas pokaże. Ja obserwuje i klikam bo jara mnie ta technologia. Uważam, że *Satoshi Nakamoto* byłby dumny z tego co tu się odpierdala. Jak ktoś podchodzi do tematu czysto spekulacyjnie to uważam, że jest teraz na to dobry czas. Dlaczego? Niedawno przeszli na mainet. Ruski gas od Vitalika, też nie taki straszny, jak straszą nas w mediach głównego ścieku 🤮\n\n### Dobra - napiszę, co tam do przeklikania\n\nNa początek musisz wejść na [zk.money](https://zk.money/signup) połączyć portfel (np. Metamask) i stworzyć swój alias \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2WIEKnA3MGihB0EOc2p8B.png?height=993&width=1635)\n\nNastępnie podpisać kilka transakcji i go zarejestrować, po czym zdeponować minimum **0.01 ETH** w celu aktywacji konta.  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MB-G30l7eZtNDojkifd3f.png?height=2151&width=3117)\n\n**Włalaaaa - Done!** Masz już swój alias i interakcje z kontraktem.  \n  \n **UWAGA!** Zapisz swój alias bo gdy go utracisz -- utracisz swoje środki.  \n W zkmoney **.v1** gdy nie pamiętaliśmy swojego aliasu można było wygenerować nowy. W **.v2** jest to niemożliwe! \n  \n Warto pójść o krok dalej i popatrzyć co protokół ma nam do zaoferowania. \n Zk.Money V1 oferowało nam jedynie przesyłanie ETH, DAI i renBTC pomiędzy walletami L2 & Mainet. Team postanowił pójść o krok dalej. Obecnie rozwijają private-defi aby na warstwie drugiej poza zwykłym ‘anonimowym’ przesyłaniem wartości dostępne były swapy, stakinngi i inne bajery, które znamy z DEFI. Zaczeli z [LIDO](https://lido.fi/) (staking ETH dla ETH 2.0) - obecnie 4,38% APY. Druga opcja, która już jest wdrożona to staking DAI w współpracy z [ElementFi](https://www.element.fi/) . Znaleść to możemy w zakładce [EARN](https://zk.money/earn). Warto to przeklikać i wrzucić coś ETH do LIDO czy troche DAI do ElementFi na staking. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rS8YpDbaq0A3Kk8agtL7f.png?height=1188&width=2513)\n\n## 👇 Kolejne protokoły soooon ser 👇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i7DBEBz3n4o8U91Qs04DG.png?height=810&width=2494)\n\n## Co jeszcze warto zrobić?\n\n* Warto przerzucić assety z L2 na Mainet. Aby to zrobić przy wysyłce zamiast aliasu należy wkleić adres ETH *\\[0x…\\] \n *\n* Warto też przesłać asset po sieci L2. Aby to zrobić należy wkleić nie adres ETH, a alias odbiorcy. Możesz ‘posypać’ Popusiowi. Ahhh. Nie wypada tak mówić. Anyway, jak podoba Ci się, to co robie i tak bardzo chcesz - mój login masz na screenach wyżej. \n \n* Jeśli interesuje Cię więcej, warto dołączyć na [Discord](https://discord.gg/DePA3Uvd)\n\n### UWAGA!\n\n> Co do oficjalnej informacji o *#airdrop*.  Team nic takiego nie potwierdził.  \n Nie potwierdzili też tego, że kiedykolwiek powstanie token. Dodam, że większość potwierdzonych dropów wychodziła słabo. Zgodzisz się ze mną? \n *“…Cicha woda brzegi rwie!”*  \n\nNa koniec jeszcze jedna uwaga. Jeśli obserwujesz mnie dłużej to pewnie o zk.money już wiesz i bawiłeś się tam już na v1. Jeśli tak to zaloguj się na [old.zk.money](https://old.zk.money/) i przenieś swoje assety na L1 po czym dokonaj ponownej migracji na L2 tworząc nowy alias. Tak mi doradzono na discordzie i tak zrobiłem. \n\nTemat będę obserwował dalej. Jeśli Cię to zainteresowało zapraszam do mnie na telegram i twitter aby być na bieżąco.\n\n* [Twitter Popek1990.eth](https://twitter.com/popek1990crypto)\n* [Telegram Popek1990.ETH \\[Ogłoszenia\\]](https://t.me/popek1990crypto)\n\n```\nDyskusje w komentarzach na twitter ✌️\n```", "timestamp": 1658274549, "digest": "lWecFymSfagUdIlhOwLDJpjIBPlm-3qG4_FmT9vnfvU", "contributor": "0x4f0a57351c468842A6F0efE26597195A1F29e239"}

It is also Ethereum's first great alternative to the mainstream publishing platforms like Medium and WordPress.\n\n**Some of their highlights:**\n\n[https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x9F6F91078A5072A8B54695DAfA2374Ab3cCd603b](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x9F6F91078A5072A8B54695DAfA2374Ab3cCd603b)\n\n[https://ens.mirror.xyz/-eaqMv7XPikvXhvjbjzzPNLS4wzcQ8vdOgi9eNXeUuY](https://ens.mirror.xyz/-eaqMv7XPikvXhvjbjzzPNLS4wzcQ8vdOgi9eNXeUuY)\n\n[https://kitteh.mirror.xyz/editions/0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175/40](https://kitteh.mirror.xyz/editions/0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175/40)\n\n## Importance of Mirror\n\nNow anyone could put out anything that they've published as NFTs, enabling their biggest fans to support them and become early investors in their work. Readers could send tips and receive tokens as a reward for supporting their favorite writers which results in building a vibrant community and Mirror provides smart contracts for crowd-funding a new initiative directly from the writings.\n\nAll this by completely circumventing advertisers who constantly interrupt your reading flow by getting in your face with messaging hints at every visit!\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1449909594516455426](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1449909594516455426)\n\n## How do Mirror Works?\n\nMirror uses Arweave to permanently store users' content. The average cost of storing data on the decentralized storage protocol currently is $0.01 per gigabyte, which Mirror takes care of for its users. In doing so, they are able to offer free publishing services. Additionally, unlike traditional online platforms that require strenuous login processes and accounts, Mirror uses\n\n\"Sign in with Ethereum\" method for authentication. It makes independent verification possible through non-Ethereum keypair that signs the posts and are stored in Arweave which then is paired with writers Ethereum address. Nobody has to disclose any private information, no need to sign up for an email account and no need for creation of a new password.\n\n## Key Features\n\n* **Mirror Editor**\n\nThis text editor and publisher lets users build posts with media blocks. eg: Images, crypto economic blocks, and embedded auctions.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editor](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editor)\n\n* **Crowd Funding**\n\nMirror lets users crowdfund a project, i.e. an Ethereum smart contract for raising funds, via its text and media blocks - like videos. Contributors receive a token(ERC20) that represents their participation and ownership in the project.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/crowdfunds](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/crowdfunds)\n\n* **Splits**\n\nSplit is an ERC20-compliant smart contract-based payments routing mechanism that lets creators allocate funds from auctions or donations to “collaborators, the people that have inspired you, or to donate proceeds from your work.”\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/splits](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/splits)\n\n* **Entry NFTs**\n\nPosts on Mirror can be minted as 1/1 non-fungible tokens. This means that they are collectors items that anyone who wants a souvenir of this moment in time or just an avid fan can help the creator get some financial backing for the creation of future projects!\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/mint-writing-nfts](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/mint-writing-nfts)\n\n* **Edition**\n\nA functionality for creating a limited supply of identical NFTs at a fixed price, e.g. 100 pieces of crypto-art. This new feature will bring about an exciting new implementation for non-fungible items and will allow users to create fixed editions, as well as trade and identify digital art through various methods on the blockchain with ease.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editions](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editions)\n\n* **Entry Editions**\n\nCreators can use this tokenization system to mint their Mirror posts as limited-edition NFTs instead of 1/1s.\n\n* **Tokens**\n\nA decentralized frontend for easy ERC20 token minting and distribution of governance token to build vibrant communities.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/tokens](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/tokens)\n\n## How to create a Crowdfund?\n\n1\\.

It has funded notable projects including Uniswap, 1Inch, Yearn Finance, and more. It was founded by Scott Moore, Kevin Owocki, and Vivek Singh in November 2017.\n\n## Key features of Gitcoin\n\n**Earn:** Help develop public goods by offering bounties to those who work on open source projects, organize hackathons and other fundraisers sponsored by some of the most innovative Web3 organizations, or start a new initiative to help solve some of humanity’s most pressing coordination problems.\n\n* [Earn in bounties](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?network=mainnet&applicants=ALL&order_by=-_val_usd_db)\n* [Earn in hackathons](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons)\n* [Earn in grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/)\n\n**Learn:** Help build and shape the blockchain industry by participating in hackathons, workshops and roundtable discussions hosted by the experts of the industry. Or, if you’re looking for a more hands-on approach to learning material, why not do what some of our finest minds do and prepare yourself as one of them would? Find them, network with them, and study under their wing. That's right. They are offering a Kernel fellowship program so that you too can become a blockchain Kernel.\n\n* [Learn in a hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons)\n* [Learn through fellowship](https://www.kernel.community/en/)\n* [Learn through Quests](https://gitcoin.co/quests)\n\n**Connect:** Join the next generation of web developers as you connect and build with top open source developers in the space. Find peers who compliment your skillset and team up to take on bounties and hackathons. Or join their 8 week Kernel fellowship program online where they mentor, guide and support each other through hands-on training while engaging in weekly meet-ups and workshops!\n\n* [Connect through fellowship](https://www.kernel.community/en/)\n* [Connect through building](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons)\n\n**Funding:** Fund the open web and shape its future. Choose the projects and technology you believe are most vital to the health of this world, and contribute to them directly during quarterly Gitcoin Grants rounds which use quadratic funding.\n\n* [Fund grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/)\n\n## How do Gitcoin Grants work?\n\nIt starts with a Grant page, a pool of funds, and a community of contributors.\n\nGrants begin with a page for your project and a pool of matching funds. Using the power of quadratic funding, donors will signal their support for grantees and democratically decide where the matching funds should go.\n\nIf you’re a grantee, one of the important things to note is that the number and amount of each contribution to your project influences the total amount allocated to you. If you’re a contributor, even a small contribution can have a huge impact on the amount of matching funding a grantee gets .This is the power of quadratic funding.\n\nFor example:\n\n> Traditional matching<!-- -->Grant 1 gets $100.<!-- -->Grant 2 gets $100.<!-- -->At the end of the round, both grants get $100 in matching.\n\n> Gitcoin quadratic matching<!-- -->Grant 1 gets $100 from 1 funder.<!-- -->Grant 2 gets $100 from 10 funders.<!-- -->At the end of the round, Grant 1 gets $10 in matching, Grant 2 gets $190 in matching.\n\nSee how a number of small contributions can have a huge impact on the total amount of matching funding a grantee gets!\n\nGitcoin Grants is really all about communities coming together to help fund and signal support for public goods.\n\n### How to create a Grant?\n\n1\\.

{"id": "hPjDvcMc6L_tEeHPS6St6ETwjYMfoT1vIr6rytkvDzk", "title": "The DAO Story of FINE#8385", "body": "Hey! I am FINE & I am doing fine. I will be honest, I am no story teller but I want my story to be out there! Why? Because of the possibilities and opportunities that DAOs are offering right now for everyone. We are entering a new age, an age where age, color, caste, nationality, religion or nothing matters for earning or owning something. What you need is an internet connection and basic ideas about how these DAO things work to make a living, to build your empire or even To start a movement. Okay let's start.\n\nI am an 18year old boy in India working part time for DAOs. What will make most of you interested is the fact that I can earn more than 400 dollars  for a couple of hours mainly because of my knowledge in this field and guys I am just getting started. I know the amount is no big deal but the way I am earning it is something all of you should care about! Why? There is no escape from new technology, when the internet came everyone had no option but to go with it, that's how new tech works. Entered DAOs only in the beginning of march. In case you don't know what a DAO is, it is a decentralized autonomous organization that means an organization that runs by code and no major person has the final say and instead the community has the major say. How is all this possible? Well the answer is Blockchain technology. A new technology is also = things happening that never happened in human history before! Actually I have a lot to say and donno where to start. I may derail from the track from what I am saying so please stick with me.\n\nI got hyped about blockchain technology after watching the [comments of top tech leaders](https://youtu.be/GVN0Ddr3xig) on blockchain technology. I started just like most of the people, started trading crypto currency and lost money, my entry to crypto was in July 2021. Started heavily learning about everything from the [Coin Bureau](https://youtu.be/Fu4lrv47c0g) youtube channel and the journey of 8months led me to the gem DAOs!! \n\nI just lost interest in making money and wanted to follow my heart. I always wanted to serve humanity, so I setted out to start an organisation! An organisation where anyone can tell their problems and anyone can make a living for solving those problems! Ironically the organisation name is also FINE. I got this name from my Father, he is a hardworking man who just can't stop working!(farmer blood). Even though the project is still down I learned something. This is something I always knew but I think I fully understood it only when I experienced it. I was behind money making = no value. I was behind something of value to the world and all of a sudden I started earning! \n\nI went to ARAGON DAO to create and manage DAO as it is the go to place for everyone of DAOs, the community was really helpful specially anson parker. \n\nI saw a bounty there. They were looking for Hindi translators to translate their documents. I was 99% sure that I wouldn't get it, as there were many better candidates than me. Still I applied and I remember those lines \" Hey! I am a student and I understand 5 languages \" \n\nA person who goes by the Identity @Lion917 reached out to me and guided me to Bankless South Asia DAO!** \n **\n\nI started as a Malayalam translator there using my 4years old complaint phone Vivo Y55s. Pointing it out just to say that. We don't need a heavy setup to earn or start, it definitely helps but it would be better if we just start right away with what we have and trust me it is more than enough!\n\nNo one will judge you here. We just respect the effort and give maximum support expecting nothing in return! I had knowledge in blockchain space for the past 7months so it was not that kind of a big deal for me to trust everything. For a beginner it would be hard but the community will help you out. Beware of scams please.. There are plenty of them. Okay coming to the point. I am now working for an Internet community without knowing anyone's name and not revealing my own identity. Here skills matter more than certificates. I was getting paid in an internet currency or governance token. Hey, here is another big deal of working for DAOs. In our real life we get paid in fiat currency if we work for an organisation but here we get the share of the company i.e. governance token = you have a say or you can shape the future of the organisation you are working for!! About hierarchical structure, here we the contributors have the say. Let me get back to my experiences.\n\nI received my first payment at the end of the month and I felt sooo proud; it was proof that all my weird thoughts(for the majority) were true. This is an untaken path for the masses for now. I then started attending the weekly meetings which were more than amazing!! There is this Awesome guy called @0xbaer who made me really comfortable there. Guided me through everything and even helped me through everything. Another thing to point out is everybody is kind here. One reason is because if we are not we will be kicked. My 1st bounty work was pathetic. I understood it only later. They carefully started pointing out everything I did right and then requested me to make some parts better. Later I started attending weekly meetings which lead me to more opportunities. Attending meetings is another great way to get involved heavily.\n\nI then became a marketer, content creator, reviewer and even the coordinator! The growth was exponential. If I was going with the masses, I would be attending school and hating the things I should be learning etc etc but here, I was so damn interested in learning as everything was helping me right away. Actually I was getting paid for learning if we look through this angle. Reading newsletter = learning. I was learning and getting exposed to outside parties. I was getting guided In the right direction. I wanted to work full time for DAOs and started joining other DAOs and started using the same butterfly principle again. \n\nA guy named @enfin reached out to me and introduced peopleDAO and Language DAO! Attended some meetings and I am part of the accounting team, writer, multi Sig signer and Mod operator! I had no prior experience doing any of these!! \n\nThe point is everything is flexible here, if you are willing to take the effort this is a golden opportunity! I am a person who lives by the lines: Never trade time for money!! I am so comfortable here as there Is meaning for the time I am spending. I am getting ownership in the community! \n\nThere are no bad vibe hierarchies here. I have to speak about @jengajojo.eth. An amazing person, Leader of IMN. I am pretty sure he is super solid and busy! I didn't know it and was always reaching out to him for doubts and help. He was replying ASAP and helping, which doesn't make sense if we look at our traditional hierarchies. Can we just go to the MD and say: hey i don't know what to do! ? No right? I am not saying that there is no hierarchical structure here. In Fact we do and there is no escape from hierarchies in any creative domains. I just didn't know whom I should be talking to and I went to Jenga. 90% of the people you see here will be like that. That's what from my experience I understood. \n\nHey! Another thing, did you know that you could get paid just for chilling?? Well there are rewards for active community members also. What that literally means is a little earning just for being active in the community. I said little just because I don't want to sound like DAOs get rich quickly. When you are an experienced person with knowledge it is easy. We need ideas about these things mainly. For example we haven't learned how exactly you are able to read this but you know how to read and benefit from this! We don't fully understand the working mechanism behind calls but we do have business calls with it. What I am trying to say is as long as you have trust in all these things and the idea, you can do anything.\n\nWorking for DAOs is like having a taste of the future! \n\n** \n  \n  \n **", "timestamp": 1658275373, "digest": "OVoGs2Oxgt3bMJ4ObmTqsGAHtRdftZaJVP1H7Ed_cW0", "contributor": "0x155250d3465Fc910a910b7C67d20C4Dd25fcb728"}

Yet, we are still pouring our money into luxuries which diminish the state of our earth. If we don’t do something to support the environment, the earth will truly be f\\*cked.\n\n## Our mission\n\nWe are living in a capitalistic system driven by money: making money the most effective driver for change. To renew the economy into a greener one, we must channel more economic activity and funding into sustainable companies.\n\n### Current philanthropic organizations are not effective\n\nOne of the major entities in supporting social impact initiatives is philanthropic organizations. But, they operate confidentially. So, when we intend to donate our pocket change toward global causes, we don’t know where the money really ends up.\n\nMoreover, philanthropic organizations aim to address the short-term hurdle (ex. logging). We believe that investing in scalable projects that overcome sustainable problems at their roots\n\n### Blockchain enables everyone to invest in sustainable impact\n\nFor the last decade, groups of wealthy investors all over the world have been working to support, and invest in social impact initiatives and innovations. Yet, we, everyday investors are left out due to the lack of infrastructure.\n\nWe envision a community, regardless of contribution amount, that can band together to invest in sustainable impact.\n\nThrough recent explorations using blockchain technology, new forms of decentralized communities emerged and paved the path for making this a reality.\n\nWe are using a DAO to create a democratized and inclusive investment community thats scalable.\n\n## What we are working on\n\nWe are building ArborDAO, a DAO that collectively invests in sustainability startups using crypto.\n\nWe want to become an early fund for green founders who are seeking support, a collective investment community through crypto, and a community bridge for anyone to support green projects.\n\n## We need you!\n\nEveryone is welcome to ArborDAO.

Yet, we are still pouring our money into luxuries which diminish the state of our earth. If we don’t do something to support the environment, the earth will truly be f\\*cked.\n\n## Our mission\n\nWe are living in a capitalistic system driven by money: making money the most effective driver for change. To renew the economy into a greener one, we must channel more economic activity and funding into sustainable companies.\n\n### Current philanthropic organizations are not effective\n\nOne of the major entities in supporting social impact initiatives is philanthropic organizations. But, they operate confidentially. So, when we intend to donate our pocket change toward global causes, we don’t know where the money really ends up.\n\nMoreover, philanthropic organizations aim to address the short-term hurdle (ex. logging). We believe that investing in scalable projects that overcome sustainable problems at their roots\n\n### Blockchain enables everyone to invest in sustainable impact\n\nFor the last decade, groups of wealthy investors all over the world have been working to support, and invest in social impact initiatives and innovations. Yet, we, everyday investors are left out due to the lack of infrastructure.\n\nWe envision a community, regardless of contribution amount, that can band together to invest in sustainable impact.\n\nThrough recent explorations using blockchain technology, new forms of decentralized communities emerged and paved the path for making this a reality.\n\nWe are using a DAO to create a democratized and inclusive investment community thats scalable.\n\n## What we are working on\n\nWe are building ArborDAO, a DAO that collectively invests in sustainability startups using crypto.\n\nWe want to become an early fund for green founders who are seeking support, a collective investment community through crypto, and a community bridge for anyone to support green projects.\n\n## We need you!\n\nEveryone is welcome to ArborDAO.

{"id": "DtKcyENfhxjKVFkmZCkg4WLUn3l-KqFnjW2SSO4xIzk", "title": "Web3: Narratives of Disruption", "body": "Instead of pursuing a false debate on whether this next-generation technology should be centralized or decentralized, we should ask how best can we arrange the narrative for desirable decentralization. This engaging narrative is constructed by making the mission and objectives among Web3 platforms more about coordination. In turn, this will create a space that allows individuals to maintain ownership and autonomy of the internet and its foundations. This is not some kind of freakish fiction but rather a reality of what is possible in today's Web3 repository. Through innovative technologies (NFT platforms, currency exchange, and wallet providers) in tandem with people-powered initiatives, Web3 is blossoming into a system of efficiently solving the problem found in centralized systems. Allowing self-sovereign identities their right for communication, privacy, and governance, but that doesn't come without its obstacles.\n\n**Objective / Disclaimer**\n\nWeb3 is unfolding into new territories daily, building communities to find each other, holding themselves accountable towards the same mission and connecting with others. As a disclaimer to you reading this post, I am not an expert. I am naturally a researcher and enthusiast of the possibilities behind Web3 and decentralized narratives. I hope that by the time you finish reading this, you feel more familiar with Web3 and how decentralization plays a crucial role in facilitating the new narratives of what the internet was always meant to serve. I also strongly encourage everyone to always do as a motto states and \"Do your own research\" (DYOR) as a practice.\n\n**Pre-requisite**\n\nLet's start with Web1, which started around the early 90s, a version of the internet that was a space where consumers were primarily users on an open network of information (the read-only era). What Web1 had was many barriers to entry because of how technical the user experience was, which excluded the majority from using the internet. Leading us into the Web2 age, the centralization age came in with fewer barriers to entry due to big tech platforms such as Yahoo and Google who provided us with excellent user experience interfaces. This grew the consumer demand at scale. Most of us use this version today, where the primary focus is targeted advertisements and lack of privacy heralded by the arrival of social media. The Web2 internet we know today has needed the reliance on centralized intermediaries (Google, Meta, Amazon).\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nThe main principle of Web3 is decentralization. Rather than being controlled by Big Tech, governments, financial institutions, or large corporations, it's entirely run by a community of individuals seeking to make a difference to combat our current Web2 form. This Web2 form has been governed by addictive, abrasive, and controlling narratives that I believe users are fed up with. Now, the technology underpinning Web3 makes it possible for far more inventive open-source and decentralized systems to be created — and enables decentralized economies (based on Blockchain systems that incentivize the stakeholders, developers, contributors, and consumers alike) to form around them. When this happens successfully will enable the products and services of Web3 to compete with and eventually surpass those of Web2.\n\n**Opportunity**\n\nCreatives now have an opportunity to leverage this technology and set it up to become a significant driver of economic growth. This can alter the workforce economy into new realms of possibility to significantly impact how we operate as a society (think about how DAOs, NFTs, and the Metaverse can help play this out?!). This is where I find the most utopic possibility in Web3, where the creator economy and the workforce collide. Bringing artists, lawyers, developers, and creators together from around the globe to create ideas and monetize them globally in permissionless crypto-economic systems— and essentially defining the future of work.\n\n**Value Creation**\n\nIdeas and community contributions of working toward a shared goal that gains value over time (through individuals who feed that value creation) are gaining momentum in various social communities (Friends with benefits, Forefront, and Party DAO). A concept that results in an ecosystem of equity that doesn't exclude the niche. The governing principle behind Web 3 takes us back to the idea we spoke about at the start of this post around Web1 which was the first version of open-source visions, so we are right back where we started. In a space filled with skeptics, naysayers, and the uninterested, my advice to you is to find where your area is in Web3 and begin to implement the change you want to see in the future. This isn't going anywhere, nor is it a hoax— It's the early stages of something completely new and has the potential to be shaped by the right set of values.\n\n**Here a list of some fun places to start:** \n\n* <https://decentraland.org/>\n* <https://rabbithole.gg/>\n* <https://rally.io/>\n* <https://mirror.xyz/>\n* <https://dune.com/home>\n* <https://www.radardao.xyz/>\n* <https://chain.link/>\n* <https://forefront.market/feed>\n* <https://www.fwb.help/>\n* <https://party.mirror.xyz/>\n* <https://gitcoin.co/>\n* <https://flamingodao.xyz/>\n* <https://snapshot.org/#/>\n* <https://rabbithole.gg/>", "timestamp": 1658277879, "digest": "wZskKFe00TcXfxQLMS2HzfNKpC6PijWU7xlNAmbNCy0", "contributor": "0xF1F144271438B53c38Bc502D804878D7b295e563"}

Sushiswap also received a decent chunk from this airdrop.\n\n[https://twitter.com/SushiSwap/status/1306493893492449281?s=20&t=4gg1SnKkzX7f4lyyQepguQ](https://twitter.com/SushiSwap/status/1306493893492449281?s=20&t=4gg1SnKkzX7f4lyyQepguQ)\n\nOver the past two years though, Uniswap has undoubtedly been the winner with the largest DEX market share amongst the two and the Dex market in general. Innovation keeps winning!\n\n## Section 1: Airdrop Recipients $UNI Holdings\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064174/1827931/16bce33c-b27d-478c-acef-e6a20ee5898b?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064174/1827931/16bce33c-b27d-478c-acef-e6a20ee5898b?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064174/1827935/cb95ab2c-bdee-4a49-919c-2f4d2e4c195c?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064174/1827935/cb95ab2c-bdee-4a49-919c-2f4d2e4c195c?display=iframe)\n\nAs seen in the query above, \\~220k addresses have claimed their $UNI tokens and they have claimed a total of \\~136M $UNI tokens. At that time of writing, that $UNI is worth just over $1Billion. That begets the question, what’s the current balance of $UNI tokens held by the $UNI airdrop recipients?\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1037563/1789711/974d8953-f73e-4b4b-81d0-69050943a0ae?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1037563/1789711/974d8953-f73e-4b4b-81d0-69050943a0ae?display=iframe)\n\nAs seen in the chart above, the balance of $UNI held by airdrop recipients has been declining since the airdrop to a current balance of 12.7M $UNI tokens. That is currently only \\~8.5% of the $UNI tokens that was claimed. \n\nThe highest balance (66.7M $UNI held by $UNI airdrop recipients was on September 27th 2020 (just over a week from when the airdrop was announced).\n\nI thought it would be interesting to dig more into this data, so I created two Pie charts that divided the Airdrop recipients into the following profiles:\n\n**Non $UNI Holder** - Addresses that no longer hold $UNI \n**Plankton** - Addresses that hold less than 10k $UNI \n**Shrimp** - Addresses that hold more than 10k $UNI \n**Fish** - Addresses that hold more than 100k $UNI\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1041370/1796243/35ed3031-57b5-466f-b266-e577394ed940?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1041370/1796243/35ed3031-57b5-466f-b266-e577394ed940?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1041370/1796284/4d394f53-0792-4c28-ac06-fd56dac100d8?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1041370/1796284/4d394f53-0792-4c28-ac06-fd56dac100d8?display=iframe)\n\nSimilar to the balance of $UNI held by airdrop recipients, this pie chart is dominated by addresses that no longer hold $UNI tokens - 89.2%.\n\n## Section 2: Top 100 Airdrop Recipients $UNI Holdings\n\nSection 1 analysis would be incomplete if we didn’t look at what the top airdrop recipients were up to. In this [query](https://dune.com/queries/1037369) you can find the top 100 airdrop recipients and how much $UNI they received.\n\nThe top 100 addresses received 30M $UNI in total and currently hold a balance of \\~3.12M $UNI tokens. The ratio of the amount they claimed and current balance is very similar to what we found for all airdrop recipients in Section 1.\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1037407/1789661/5285a353-148c-4620-aa6a-2604a317a722?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1037407/1789661/5285a353-148c-4620-aa6a-2604a317a722?display=iframe)\n\nI created charts of the daily outflows, inflows and netflows for the Top 100 Airdrop recipients and also all airdrop recipients.\n\nIf you want to dig deeper then you can find them [here](https://dune.com/Henrystats/uniswap-2020-airdop-recipients).\n\n## Section 3: Airdrop Recipients Governance Participation\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053492/1812862/dbb4d3a3-e949-482a-8c94-c3aef88f2a90?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053492/1812862/dbb4d3a3-e949-482a-8c94-c3aef88f2a90?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053492/1812865/7e4389b5-7413-45f6-98e1-333bb1716979?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053492/1812865/7e4389b5-7413-45f6-98e1-333bb1716979?display=iframe)\n\nAs seen in the counters above, airdrop recipients have delegated \\~19.3M $UNI of the total 220M $UNI ever delegated.\n\nThe below charts show the total delegated uni vs airdrop recipients delegated uni over time and the number of uni delegators vs airdrop recipients delegators.\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053454/1812756/5b3e304c-473e-44fc-a70a-b4eae423938e?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053454/1812756/5b3e304c-473e-44fc-a70a-b4eae423938e?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053062/1812725/ccc9e1af-6634-44a3-b744-a5b8dabd267f?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053062/1812725/ccc9e1af-6634-44a3-b744-a5b8dabd267f?display=iframe)\n\n**N.B this doesn’t filter for addresses that do not hold $UNI anymore. I’ve created counters to get the number of delegators that still hold $UNI.**\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053963/1829103/cb487cb9-8e33-47e5-b1f3-2ce7be670d1f?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053963/1829103/cb487cb9-8e33-47e5-b1f3-2ce7be670d1f?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053995/1829108/d9fed0a9-0bd3-42c5-8f4d-cb9bf549f356?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053995/1829108/d9fed0a9-0bd3-42c5-8f4d-cb9bf549f356?display=iframe)\n\n## Section 4: Airdrop Recipients Protocol Usage\n\nIn this section, we’ll be looking at our airdrop recipients and their interaction with Uniswap. The first charts we’ll look at is a profile of airdrop recipients defined by the number of trades they’ve made on Uniswap.\n\n**Here are the profiles:**\n\n**Airdrop Seller** - Recipients that made only one transaction \n**Frequent trader** - Recipients that made more than one transaction \n**Active trader** - Recipients that made more than 100 transactions \n**Baby Dolphin Trader** - Recipients that made more than 1000 transactions \n**Dolphin Trader** - Recipients that made more than 10k transactions\n**Whale Trader** - Recipients that made more than 100k transactions\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1045343/1803079/245298e7-fd05-43d7-8707-f7d6d575d5cc?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1045343/1803079/245298e7-fd05-43d7-8707-f7d6d575d5cc?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1045343/1803181/14fcb2bd-f36d-43c1-80f2-62ed9811b1dc?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1045343/1803181/14fcb2bd-f36d-43c1-80f2-62ed9811b1dc?display=iframe)\n\nAs seen in the chart above, the airdrop recipients traded majorly on V2 with \\~180k traders, compared to V3’s \\~60k traders. There were also in total \\~40k recipients that traded only once.\n\nPie Charts do more justice to this data, so here’s some:\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803419/4b825fc9-0b9c-4964-b162-913be22397e2?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803419/4b825fc9-0b9c-4964-b162-913be22397e2?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803427/478bccba-ec0b-4e06-b646-76fdbf2714a1?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803427/478bccba-ec0b-4e06-b646-76fdbf2714a1?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803574/cb878621-6852-4433-81bb-f1194e5d1272?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803574/cb878621-6852-4433-81bb-f1194e5d1272?display=iframe)\n\nInteresting to note that even though there were \\~11m more transactions on V2 than there was on **V3**, the volume traded on **V3** was much higher with a difference of roughly **$100bn**.\n\nThere was in total **\\~$244bn** traded on Uniswap by Airdrop Recipients. That is amazing!\n\n### What were the most traded pairs?\n\nIn this [query](https://dune.com/queries/1046417) you’ll find the top 100 most traded pairs.\n\n**WETH/USDC (V3)** was the largest traded pair with over **$100bn** in volume and a whooping **465k** trades.\n\nFrom the query linked above, all top 10 most traded pairs had at least one of **WETH** or a Stablecoin (**USDC**, **DAI** & **USDT**).\n\n### Total liquidity deposited on Uniswap?\n\nLiquidity provision is very important to Uniswap Protocol, so it’s important to also look at the sum of assets deposited in liquidity pools by airdrop recipients.\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1052639/1811756/3399333e-2032-4dbf-aad0-8735e34851e6?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1052639/1811756/3399333e-2032-4dbf-aad0-8735e34851e6?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1046816/1811718/66a503fc-ede6-4c76-b70d-715b9066d018?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1046816/1811718/66a503fc-ede6-4c76-b70d-715b9066d018?display=iframe)\n\n**\\~$247bn** was deposited by airdrop recipients, that is a lot! There’s also no surprise that the two most deposited assets were **WETH** & **USDC**. Both account for **\\~$211bn** of the total value deposited.\n\n## Section 5: Airdrop Recipients that Received Other Airdrops\n\nIn this section we look at some of the most popular airdrops in the Defi space since the launch of Uniswap’s airdrop and see which of the Uniswap airdrop recipients received these airdrops.\n\n### ENS Airdrop\n\n[Airdrop Info](https://cointelegraph.com/news/early-ethereum-name-service-ens-adopters-rewarded-with-a-hefty-five-figure-airdrop)\n**Date: November, 8th, 2021.**\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828837/b23af0dd-f2e9-4521-94e0-c97116dc3012?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828837/b23af0dd-f2e9-4521-94e0-c97116dc3012?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828839/56a720b6-e5c6-40d2-8263-84c1b0ca79d4?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828839/56a720b6-e5c6-40d2-8263-84c1b0ca79d4?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828841/d3dc22d4-8407-433d-9d7b-fd6bfff583b6?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828841/d3dc22d4-8407-433d-9d7b-fd6bfff583b6?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828845/3172aed2-3a8e-44ed-a83e-cd60a19c974c?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828845/3172aed2-3a8e-44ed-a83e-cd60a19c974c?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828851/fb1f9217-dd2d-48d1-a265-def9a6ae4b1e?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828851/fb1f9217-dd2d-48d1-a265-def9a6ae4b1e?display=iframe)\n\nFull dashboard [here](https://dune.com/Henrystats/uniswap-2020-airdop-recipients).", "timestamp": 1658279514, "digest": "jsNVzaVx-3BkqmdHR_VPwsjR0JZD0nUwa-2tf7zDXdU", "contributor": "0xe5fF2C80759db9408dC9fD22b155b851Cd5aAA94"}

Joke, ale tak należy rozumieć zk.money i stojące za tym zkSNARK bo coś w tym jest 😜\n\n \n Od razu napiszę, że nie mam się za znachora w tym temacie. Napiszę to co wiem ✌️Postaram się pisać językiem, abyś mnie zrozumiał/a.  \n Jest to też potencjalna spekulacja. Większość osób ma oczy skierowane w kierunku **#StarkNet**. A Popek obserwuję podobne protokoły, które mają mniejszy socialhype, a zarazem fajnie się rozwijają - no i tokena brak. Dlatego dziś będzie o zk.money, a nie o StarkNet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2K-1MxaAX1hUd0dQuMUUs.png?height=607&width=1694)\n\n## zk.money - warstwa 2 na ETH skupiona na prywatności 👀\n\n**[zk.money](https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork)** to *dApps* do ochrony prywatności w warstwie 2 umożliwiający użytkownikom prywatne przesyłanie **$ETH, $DAI & $renBTC** ( renBTC *był w v1 ale v2 obecnie off - wróci imo*). Zk.Money jest zbudowane na silniku [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) (*Zk-Rollup na Eth)* w technologi zkSNARK . Aztec jest porównywalny do [zkSync](https://medium.com/@CalendarDefi/airdrop-guide-zksync-zigzag-a83ef3b33b70), ale koncentruje się na prywatności, której w zkSync brak. Więcej o ich wizji przeczytasz [tutaj](https://aztec.network/vision).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XME4s721Yez0zhziC8YLK.png?height=891&width=2545)\n\n**Podam prosty przykład anonimowej wysyłki $ETH aby Ci to bardziej zobrazować:**\n\n* **Deponujesz** *(shield) *$ETH **lub** $DAI z mainetu na **zk-money L2 \n **\n* Znając **alias *(login)*** drugiej osoby wysyłasz jej $ETH lub $Dai po L2 (sobie, delerowi, whatever). Koszt transakcji bardzo niski (L2). Dzięki technologi **zero-knowledge proof** druga strona otrzyma ETH, ale nadawca nie będzie znany.  \n Co ciekawsze ty jako wysyłający masz dostęp do potwierdzenia, że transakcja pochodzi od Ciebie (gdyby zaszła taka potrzeba to, to potwierdzisz).  \n **Nikt inny nie ma do tego dostępu bez twojego walletu!**  \n \n* Gdy zamiast aliasu odbiorcy podasz adres ethereum środki zostaną wysłane na mainet. I ten przykład w moim przypadku ma utility w kwestiach spekulacji na multiwalletach. Wiesz sybil i te sprawy. Czaisz, prawda? Ahhh, jak ja dużo Ci mówię…🤫\n\n## Dobra skończ pie\\*\\*\\* Popku, przejdź do konkretów i mów co to, i po co mi to? 🤫\n\n[Zk.Money](https://zk.money/) i sieć [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) działają już na mainecie. Ani jedno, ani drugie nie ma jeszcze tokena. Czy będzie ? Czas pokaże. Ja obserwuje i klikam bo jara mnie ta technologia. Uważam, że *Satoshi Nakamoto* byłby dumny z tego z tej technologii. Jak ktoś podchodzi do tematu czysto spekulacyjnie to uważam, że jest teraz na to dobry czas. Dlaczego? Niedawno przeszli na mainet. Ruski gas od Vitalika, też nie taki straszny, jak straszą nas w mediach głównego ścieku 🤮\n\n### Sounds good? Dobra klikamy… 🤔\n\nNa początek musisz wejść na [zk.money](https://zk.money/signup) połączyć portfel (np. Metamask) i stworzyć swój alias *(nick)*. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2WIEKnA3MGihB0EOc2p8B.png?height=993&width=1635)\n\nNastępnie podpisać kilka transakcji i go zarejestrować, po czym zdeponować minimum **0.01 ETH** w celu aktywacji konta.  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MB-G30l7eZtNDojkifd3f.png?height=2151&width=3117)\n\n**Włalaaaa - Done!** Masz już swój alias i interakcje z kontraktem. Wen drop? Za co drop? Trudno wyczuć… A więc czytaj dalej ziom, to zwiększy twoją szansę. \n  \n **UWAGA!** Zapisz swój alias bo gdy go utracisz -- **utracisz swoje środki**.  \n W zk.money **.v1** gdy nie pamiętaliśmy swojego aliasu można było wygenerować nowy. W **.v2** jest to niemożliwe! \n  \n Warto pójść o krok dalej i popatrzyć co protokół ma nam do zaoferowania. \n **Zk.Money V1** oferowało nam jedynie przesyłanie ETH, DAI i renBTC pomiędzy walletami L2 & Mainet. Team postanowił pójść o krok dalej. Obecnie rozwijają private-defi, aby na warstwie drugiej poza zwykłym ‘anonimowym’ przesyłaniem wartości dostępne były swapy, stakinngi i inne bajery, które znamy z DEFI. Zaczeli z [LIDO](https://lido.fi/) (staking ETH dla ETH 2.0) - obecnie *4,38% APY*. Druga opcja, która już jest wdrożona to staking DAI w współpracy z [ElementFi](https://www.element.fi/) . Znaleść to możemy w zakładce [EARN](https://zk.money/earn). Warto to przeklikać i wrzucić coś ETH do LIDO czy trochę DAI do ElementFi na staking. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rS8YpDbaq0A3Kk8agtL7f.png?height=1188&width=2513)\n\n## 👇 Kolejne protokoły soooon ser 👇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i7DBEBz3n4o8U91Qs04DG.png?height=810&width=2494)\n\n## Co jeszcze warto zrobić?\n\n* Warto przerzucić assety z L2 na Mainet. Aby to zrobić przy wysyłce zamiast aliasu należy wkleić adres ETH *\\[0x…\\] \n *\n* Warto też przesłać asset po sieci L2. Aby to zrobić należy wkleić nie adres ETH, a alias odbiorcy. Możesz ‘posypać’ Popusiowi. Ahh, jak to słodko brzmi 😂 \n Anyway, jak podoba Ci się, to co robię i tak bardzo chcesz - mój login masz na screenach wyżej. Donate & spekulacja 2w1. Opcjonalnie możesz wysłać sobie na drugi wallet. I do tego zachęcam. Popek nie żebrak o_0  \n \n* Jeśli interesuje Cię temat, warto dołączyć do nich na [Discord](https://discord.gg/DePA3Uvd) i się troszkę poudzielać. Może w przyszłości będą jakieś role? A może drop na podstawie napisanych znaków na ich discordzie tak jak to było chociażby na Lyra.Finance (optimism). Tak - tak było. Sam się na to załapałem i wpadło sympatycznie 😉\n\n### UWAGA!\n\n> Co do oficjalnej informacji o *#airdrop*.  Team nic takiego nie potwierdził.  \n Nie potwierdzili też tego, że kiedykolwiek powstanie token. Dodam, że większość potwierdzonych dropów wychodziła słabo. Zgodzisz się ze mną? \n *“…Cicha woda brzegi rwie!”*\n\nNa koniec jeszcze jedna uwaga. Jeśli obserwujesz mnie dłużej to pewnie o zk.money już wiesz i bawiłeś się tam już na v1. Jeśli tak to zaloguj się na [old.zk.money](https://old.zk.money/) i przenieś swoje assety na L1 po czym dokonaj ponownej migracji na L2 tworząc nowy alias.

{"id": "lv9__ZCL2e7SxFqwJ8kCqPxaeAtWOnL4GJ-wuCvrlDA", "title": "Reveel - Manifesto", "body": "*Introducing [Reveel](https://www.r3vl.xyz/), the financial stack for Web3 collaboration.*\n\n## The Future of Collaboration\n\nThe crypto movement, since its very beginning, has aimed to disrupt industries by shifting the balance of power back from intermediaries to end users.\n\nAs Web3 has emerged, artists, creative entrepreneurs, and builders - we’ll call them creators - have been drawn to this technology for that very reason. Indeed, this creative class has long been on the short end of the stick, subject to gatekeepers & centralized platforms that capture a vast portion of the value created by their art, their content, and their business.\n\nDecentralization & ownership, the core principles of Web3, offer these creators new opportunities to develop, manage, and monetize their work & their communities.\n\nThese principles also offer new ways to collaborate. When ideas, talent, and resources are distributed, new and more fluid collectives surface to deliver on projects. Similarly, **when ownership is pushed to the edges of the network, to its users, collaboration becomes shared property. And shared interest becomes shared equity**.\n\nBut the blockchain is still a nascent technology and its adoption by creators still requires an advanced level of technical knowledge which greatly reduces accessibility to Web3. For the technology to facilitate collaboration & deliver on its promise to creators, many building blocks still need to be developed.\n\nOne of those building blocks is a financial stack that supports the shift towards this new way of working together and offers creators a fluid revenue sharing & revenue management solution. **A building block to unleash Web3 collaboration**.\n\n## Reveel\n\nWe’ve started **[Reveel](https://www.r3vl.xyz/)** to create that building block.\n\nAt its core, Reveel strives to become a financial layer for collaboration in Web3 - **the financial stack for Web3 collaboration** - and a bedrock for creators to grow upon.\n\nWe understand that collaboration can generate friction: How do creators identify partnership opportunities? How and when do collaborators get paid? How do collectives define & monitor success?\n\nWe believe **transparency & equity** are the fundamental pillars that will enable products to solve these challenges & deliver on the promise to make collaboration simpler. This is why Reveel is building a platform that helps creators visualize and understand their on-chain income & automate the distribution of revenue amongst collaborators, rights holders, and partners.  \n In other words, Reveel is built for creators, artists, builders & brands that generate revenue on-chain and want to have more time to focus on what they do best: create.\n\nWith the support of our amazing backers, including [Binance Labs](https://labs.binance.com/) & [Moment Ventures](https://www.momentventures.com/), we’ve been able to bring together a rockstar team of seasoned Web3 developers, experienced venture builders & international touring artists, to deliver on our vision.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y4Pwd71qYD9glaxusaxf5.png?height=994&width=1705)\n\n## Announcing Reveel (v0.1)\n\nOur team is excited to announce that we are rolling out the first iteration of the platform: **[Reveel v0.1](https://app.r3vl.xyz/)**.\n\nOur initial beta includes a Revenue Share Protocol and a suite of Creator Analytics tools.\n\nThe **Revenue Share Protocol** allows creators to design & deploy their own Revenue Path (revenue share smart contract) in order to automatically split on-chain revenue with collaborators. The protocol has been implemented in a trustless, gas-efficient, and fully decentralized way. Funds can be sent to a Revenue Path and any listed recipient can withdraw their share of funds at any time, without the approval or action of any other collaborator on the smart contract, thus simplifying the revenue management aspect of collaboration.\n\nThe **Creator Analytics** offers the very first NFT analytics tool designed not just for collectors, but also for the creators themselves. Creators can track their entire catalog of NFT drops, compare their performance & draw valuable insights that guide their decision-making for future releases. Additionally, Creator Analytics allows users to track and understand their collector base, segment holders based on a variety of filters, and download collector lists. With this, Reveel allows creators to better understand how their revenue is generated and what projects & collaborations help them grow their community & their income.\n\nAs we launch Reveel, we’re fortunate to have outstanding partners, such as [Venice Music](https://www.venicemusic.co/), [Glass.xyz](https://glass.xyz/), [wavWRLD](https://wavwrld.com/), [BlackDave](https://blackdaveblackdave.com/), [Sammy Arriaga](https://sammynft.com/) and many more, who are pushing the boundaries of what it means to create & collaborate in Web3.\n\n## Join Us\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more, would like to get involved, or have a need for what we’re building, we encourage you to [reach out](http://discord.gg/r3vl).\n\nOur current version of the Revenue Share Protocol (v0.1) is in open beta and is totally free to use.

{"id": "VXVVsN3LzHp2NNxAifUZQCM-w0V5eAekw7AOdGEU9x8", "title": "Web3: Narratives of Disruption", "body": "Instead of pursuing a false debate on whether this next-generation technology should be centralized or decentralized, we should ask how best can we arrange the narrative for desirable decentralization. This engaging narrative is constructed by making the mission and objectives among Web3 platforms more about coordination. In turn, this will create a space that allows individuals to maintain ownership and autonomy of the internet and its foundations. This is not some kind of freakish fiction but rather a reality of what is possible in today's Web3 repository. Through innovative technologies (NFT platforms, currency exchange, and wallet providers) in tandem with people-powered initiatives, Web3 is blossoming into a system of efficiently solving the problem found in centralized systems. Allowing self-sovereign identities their right for communication, privacy, and governance, but that doesn't come without its obstacles.\n\n**Objective / Disclaimer**\n\nWeb3 is unfolding into new territories daily, building communities to find each other, holding themselves accountable towards the same mission and connecting with others. As a disclaimer to you reading this post, I am not an expert. I am naturally a researcher and enthusiast of the possibilities behind Web3 and decentralized narratives. I hope that by the time you finish reading this, you feel more familiar with Web3 and how decentralization plays a crucial role in facilitating the new narratives of what the internet was always meant to serve. I also strongly encourage everyone to always do as a motto states and \"Do your own research\" (DYOR) as a practice.\n\n**Pre-requisite**\n\nLet's start with Web1, which started around the early 90s, a version of the internet that was a space where consumers were primarily users on an open network of information (the read-only era). What Web1 had was many barriers to entry because of how technical the user experience was, which excluded the majority from using the internet. Leading us into the Web2 age, the centralization age came in with fewer barriers to entry due to big tech platforms such as Yahoo and Google who provided us with excellent user experience interfaces. This grew the consumer demand at scale. Most of us use this version today, where the primary focus is targeted advertisements and lack of privacy heralded by the arrival of social media. The Web2 internet we know today has needed the reliance on centralized intermediaries (Google, Meta, Amazon).\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nThe main principle of Web3 is decentralization. Rather than being controlled by Big Tech, governments, financial institutions, or large corporations, it's entirely run by a community of individuals seeking to make a difference to combat our current Web2 form. This Web2 form has been governed by addictive, abrasive, and controlling narratives that I believe users are fed up with. Now, the technology underpinning Web3 makes it possible for far more inventive open-source and decentralized systems to be created — and enables decentralized economies (based on Blockchain systems that incentivize the stakeholders, developers, contributors, and consumers alike) to form around them. When this happens successfully will enable the products and services of Web3 to compete with and eventually surpass those of Web2.\n\n**Opportunity**\n\nCreatives now have an opportunity to leverage this technology and set it up to become a significant driver of economic growth. This can alter the workforce economy into new realms of possibility to significantly impact how we operate as a society (think about how DAOs, NFTs, and the Metaverse can help play this out?!). This is where I find the most utopic possibility in Web3, where the creator economy and the workforce collide. Bringing artists, lawyers, developers, and creators together from around the globe to create ideas and monetize them globally in permissionless crypto-economic systems— and essentially defining the future of work.\n\n**Value Creation**\n\nIdeas and community contributions of working toward a shared goal that gains value over time (through individuals who feed that value creation) are gaining momentum in various social communities (Friends with benefits, Forefront, and Party DAO). A concept that results in an ecosystem of equity that doesn't exclude the niche. The governing principle behind Web 3 takes us back to the idea we spoke about at the start of this post around Web1 which was the first version of open-source visions, so we are right back where we started. In a space filled with skeptics, naysayers, and the uninterested, my advice to you is to find where your area is in Web3 and begin to implement the change you want to see in the future. This isn't going anywhere, nor is it a hoax— It's the early stages of something completely new and has the potential to be shaped by the right set of values.\n\n**Here a list of some fun places to start:**\n\n* <https://decentraland.org/>\n* <https://rabbithole.gg/>\n* <https://rally.io/>\n* <https://mirror.xyz/>\n* <https://dune.com/home>\n* <https://www.radardao.xyz/>\n* <https://chain.link/>\n* <https://forefront.market/feed>\n* <https://www.fwb.help/>\n* <https://party.mirror.xyz/>\n* <https://gitcoin.co/>\n* <https://flamingodao.xyz/>\n* <https://snapshot.org/#/>\n* <https://rabbithole.gg/>\n\nImage Credit: Vinicius Costa", "timestamp": 1658278778, "digest": "tcg278vcmkUq-1bzAZ7uTd5iSRWs3WlDqXN-p3B5RHQ", "contributor": "0xF1F144271438B53c38Bc502D804878D7b295e563"}

{"id": "MEvvpfcIdxAA5F5W7mkwgYY6-mXysk8o712s2At35sY", "title": "Milady Poem", "body": "There was a really bad month where Tomaszo stayed up late after his wife went to bed every night. He would listen to podcasts and play a skateboarding video game. He often used a cell phone application called Twitter to view and recommend to others a diverse array of ironic, cynical, sarcastically violent, earnestly violent, and/or politically extreme media that leveraged characters and stylistic themes/imagery from Japanese animation, low-resolution still shots and promotional material from outdated computer games, and assorted iconography, turns of phrase, and/or images appropriated from disparate internet communities of which he was sometimes a member and sometimes an outsider. But he also used the cell phone application to communicate his earnest thoughts and feelings so that people on the internet could console him in his paranoid schizophrenia or talk him down during bad episodes of autism.\n\nHe tweeted about how he felt this strange detachment and someone sent him a Twitter dm saying he was probably having a dissociative episode and that even though it happens to people sometimes, he shouldn’t tweet about it, because of how employers and family and whoever else can see his tweets and might do something that would make his life worse, like send him to a psychiatric hospital or prevent him from getting a different job. He thanked the person, deleted the tweet, and read most of the “dissociative disorder” article on Wikipedia.\n\nHe unpaused the skateboarding game. He dissociated some more. He had a hard time playing the game but liked having a word for what was happening. He paused the game. He looked at Twitter. He saw a brand entity icon account, @milady, post a joke about video games. Tomaszo replied to the @Milady account with a funny joke death threat. The @milady account was verified on Twitter. Tomaszo looked up how to be verified on Twitter. The verification process required a photo identification and filling out bureaucratic-seeming forms; it didn’t seem to make any sense for a brand to be verified on Twitter. Tomaszo deleted his death threat because he knew it was low-value, violent speech that wasn’t protectable under the First Amendment. Tomaszo then tweeted at the @milady account to ask if it had photo identification. The @milady account quote-tweeted Tomaszo’s tweet alongside a photo of a man being stabbed in the neck. The picture seemed real and was exceptionally graphic. There was blood and the beginnings of a gaping wound. The @milady account called Tomaszo a dumb piece of shit in the quote-tweet. Tomaszo liked the threatening and violent tweet out of a vague hope that it would defuse things. He unpaused his skateboarding game and worriedly played for seventeen minutes.\n\nHe paused the game and checked Twitter and saw that the @milady account’s quote-tweet had been deleted. The @milady account had tweeted an apology about being hacked. The apology had several thousand likes. Tomaszo received a dm from the @milady account. The @milady account called him a *little bitch.* The @milady account sent another dm calling him a *fucking narc*. The @milady account sent another dm with a picture of the man being stabbed in the neck. It looked like the same man from the first photo being stabbed for a second time.

When the two children were young, they watched the children for me, the old lady worked in the fields, and I often took the children to help. I deal with the elderly every day, and have established a very close relationship between day and night. I am fortunate to have learned important life lessons from the elderly while living happily.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uNCYYhvelt3Jvq4eJHXTH.png?height=270&width=415)\n\nAlways fill the bowl and return it\n\nThe old landlord, the old man, broke down two years ago, and now he lives in a nursing home. The old lady is the only one left at home. Thinking that it is inconvenient for the old man to be alone, I have to give a bowl of delicious food to the old lady. The old lady always accepted it happily. Two days later, she came to the door and returned the bowl to thank it. The bowl was always full. Sometimes it's the blueberries she harvests, sometimes it's chocolate for the kids, sometimes it's two snacks, but she never returns an empty bowl. The old lady never talked about her philosophy of life, but she told me with her actions: it is not enough to accept the benefits of others, and it is not enough to say thanks with your mouth, you must return it in kind, even if it is a small thing that is not valuabl\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7laxPH1vEuvkw_r26bsE3.png?height=273&width=409)\n\ne.\n\nToday's affairs will never be postponed until tomorrow\n\nEver since I met the old lady landlord, I thought she was very busy. As many people come to her every day, there are as many things to do, so whenever something in the house breaks and needs to be repaired, I am embarrassed. But as long as I mustered up the courage to speak, the old lady immediately put down what she was doing, and immediately contacted me to fix it. No matter how troublesome, no matter how much it costs, the old lady never procrastinates. Maybe she knew that feeling distressed for the current little money, or putting the problem aside for a while, would only make things worse. Unpleasant things have to be resolved immediately, the longer the delay, the harder it is to do.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IMYRuL07jaMTvESzIWJJG.png?height=270&width=417)\n\nLive and learnIn Japanese Shinto, the green leaves of the camellia family are used for decoration. The old couple planted a lot of these trees back then, and the leaves sold better than the flowers. Although this kind of business has long been discontinued, some shrines still like to ask for his family due to the good reputation they have accumulated in the past. The old lady took the call from the shrine and went to the mountain to chop branches, and then brought them back with a small truck to trim them in her garage. The old lady felt that it was a waste of time to do this work for several hours. So, she bought a CD that reads Japanese classical literature aloud and listened to it while pruning branches. Our whole family was shocked when the soft female voice echoed in the garage for the first time. The old lady who graduated from junior high school has been doing farm work all her life, and has been a big landowner for most of her life. She has a million-dollar family property. Nearly 80 years old, she is still doing farm work in the garage while listening to classical literature recitations. Continuing to learn will not make her richer, but it will make her more spiritual.", "timestamp": 1658280021, "digest": "J7h4gpaMbld9wQbZS7lMUG2winwKuAw4KbWTDRJxMy0", "contributor": "0x14bd6177124529E8409993fBf08DDB0702695730"}
{"id": "NaQvfrDkXswSt-ajwXTHI5NcOis2JfvyNO5ZsJFl0i0", "title": "I am a little goldfish", "body": "I am a little goldfish. If you really want to know how small it is, it may only be five centimeters with a ruler. I don't know where I came from, let alone what my mother looked like. For as long as I can remember, I have lived in a transparent glass tank with goldfish of various sizes and colors. The man who has passed the age of confusion sprinkles some fine powdery things into the fish tank every day. We all know that it is food. This is not because our noses are sensitive enough, but experience and habits tell us. We, in addition to eating, will never have any other surprises. At this moment, my companions and I opened our mouths and swam towards the food with lightning speed. Everyone has to go all out to try to eat more, because if we didn't eat today, we have to wait until tomorrow, which is too long for our stomachs. I don't know who spread the public opinion that goldfish can only be eaten once a day, and only a small amount, otherwise it will die. Alas, no communication is really scary. These grotesque antics always starve us, so we scrambled for less than 10 seconds. It is said that human beings cannot afford to hurt because of money, then our goldfish destroys harmony because of food.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c6ATycOZw_E421crU1QH0.png?height=266&width=435)\n\nWe had a leisurely life, but we had no bigger places to go, and I often longed for vast freedoms. If possible, I would like to fight for freedom. The funny thing is that although we are weak, we cannot find a strong enemy.\n\nEvery day when I see pedestrians hurried by, I have such a show of self-comfort in my heart: Although I don't have the freedom of your human beings, I have free food to eat, don't worry about where to live. At this time, I can finally find a sense of superiority in being a goldfish. Of course, if anyone disdains my sense of superiority, it means that you haven't realized the difficulty of this accommodation. Go and watch the BBC documentary, after watching it, you will know how difficult it is to have a meal these days, and how difficult it is to have a nest.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wpiEjr1rfcAncfNIV5eaL.png?height=266&width=450)\n\nI look happy every day, but I also have my own sadness. Every time I see my companions who have lived and played together leave, no one can see the sadness in my eyes, at least I know that humans are invisible, because they all leave with undisguised joy. But slowly I also accepted this separation, the old companion left, the new companion came, and so on. To be honest, when those goldfish were taken away one by one, in addition to being sad, I also flashed some despicable joy, but fortunately I ran fast and was not caught.\n\nThe days are just like this, when I eat comfortably and swim freely every day, it slips away quietly. One day when I was wandering around, I suddenly found that there were fewer and fewer goldfishes I was familiar with, and I realized that I had been in this fish tank for more than half a year. I suddenly wondered what life was going on for the goldfish that was taken away? And why did you stay here for so long? Is it a lucky escape every time, or are those people who don't want to take me away because I'm not pretty? I always thought it was the former. OMG! Am I not pretty? I never thought about this question. I immediately turned around a few times, and the surroundings were transparent, so I couldn't see myself. If it's really because I'm ugly that I've been kept here forever, then the joy of every escape before has become the biggest irony now.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9ylFc5S7PL5blZwZEFTGH.png?height=279&width=448)\n\nWhen someone came to pick goldfish again, I swam hard and jumped up happily. Once I was finally lucky enough to be caught, only to be brushed down mercilessly, and I was embarrassed at the time. After being eliminated again and again, I realized that I am an ornamental goldfish. My value is that humans bring me home, and when they see me, they are pleasant to the eyes and in a good mood. I hate myself for not thinking about this before.\n\nIt seems that my appearance has no advantage, and I am trapped in a pile of fish. Everyone has their own characteristics. How can I leave this place and reflect my value? I realized I couldn't stay here for comfort anymore, because no one would ever appreciate me here. To think of new places to go, I have to put in more effort than any other goldfish.\n\nTo say that in the past, I was swimming lazily, but now I am swimming happily. I want to find my strengths, I don't have a good appearance, but I want to have a healthy body. Slowly I found myself with a new skill, and that is when I hold my head up and blow bubbles with my head up, my mouth can make a loud noise, I think the strings of bubbles are matched with This voice should make me look spirited and cute. This is something that other goldfish can't do, and I snickered. Waiting quietly for the arrival of the new owner.\n\nBut a few days later, I'm still here.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hqPccJ0VqSIi9NmPpW583.png?height=279&width=448)\n\nAt this moment, a mother and a five-year-old boy came to the fish tank. The mother lets her child choose their favorite goldfish. I looked at this little boy: white skin, smooth and full forehead, big eyes focused and focused, the yellow shirt and blue plaid shorts made him more beautiful and cute. I fell in love with him right away and swam to the front without hesitation. The little boy looked left and right, not knowing which one to choose. I knew it was time to give full play to my special talents. Sure enough, the little boy picked me up decisively after seeing my performance. Maybe he was too excited. When I was just picked up, his hand shook and I was thrown to the ground mercilessly. After I got out of the water and fell, I couldn't breathe like I had asthma, and I was dying on the ground. Fortunately, the little boy picked me up immediately and put me in the water bag that the man had already prepared. I took a deep breath, and I never thought the water tasted so good. At this time, the child's mother said: \"No, I just fell to the ground, and I'm sure it won't last long. Let's pick another one!\" The little boy said: No, I want this one, who said it wouldn't live long, look how well it swims! You can blow bubbles when you fall on the ground!", "timestamp": 1658280562, "digest": "lDsj-MUk8ucck5a_PAdkXGWQbEbttU4_CB4q9OrSJxM", "contributor": "0x14bd6177124529E8409993fBf08DDB0702695730"}

{"id": "D3eQYnlQiTD6Pwt0yqhaKa0LaOZ59SI-FWcD7FFUJ30", "title": "Ability to manage emotions", "body": "There is such a young man who is irritable by nature and has difficulty controlling his emotions. His old father asked his son that if he could not control his emotions in the future, he would fix a nail on the wall in the backyard and wait for his emotions to stabilize. Pull the nail out again. So the young man followed his father's instructions. At first, he even set 30 nails a day, but every time the young man pulled out the nails, he deeply felt that the process of pulling out the nails required more effort than the act of setting the nails. Several times, so, the guy slowly began to reduce the chance of nailing, gradually, from 30 nails per day to 15, until he stopped going to the backyard to set nails for several days. Later, the old father brought the young man to the backyard and pointed to the wall board that was full of savage people. When he was out of control, the words he said were like putting nails in the heart. Even if the nails were pulled out, the scars would still be hard to recover.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QskrKJK5WtLCJvdzFJSq6.png?height=282&width=453)\n\nI vaguely remember that the story was described in this way. It is fortunate that the young man has such a wise old father, who can use such a vivid method to let his son realize the true meaning of it. Thankfully again, I saw a story that made me and the guy in the story feel the importance of emotional management. If you are angry for one minute, you will lose 60 seconds of your happy life; what you say and do when you lose your mind will make you regret immediately; a high education is a threshold for you to enter the workplace, but high emotional intelligence can help you do well in the workplace . And so on similar words are all telling us that emotional management it is important.\n\nYour ability to manage emotions is actually the quotient of your emotional management, commonly known as emotional intelligence. Expert research has pointed out that the difference between EQ and IQ is that a large part of IQ comes from heredity, and there is little chance of acquired change, but EQ can be improved through the guidance and efforts of others, so there is so much management. Learn from experts to study emotion management, and there are so many people who are looking forward to success in emotion management who don’t hesitate to take a related course.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lkeq7n9p26iXtmy6iJw48.png?height=270&width=412)\n\nSo based on the improvement of my emotional management ability, I have consulted quite a few books, and now I will share with you what I have gained.\n\nEnter the word \"emotion\" into Baidu, and there is such an explanation \"it is a reaction to the environment\". Faced with the same environment, such as a rainy day, different people will have different emotional experiences: those who meet to go out to play will feel disappointed, and farmers who are worried that the drought will affect their harvest will feel lucky. The key to different reactions is that people are different, so emotions are actually just a subjective reaction of people to the internal and external environment. Many times, the uncomfortable physiological reactions that emotions bring to us and the adverse consequences of their actions will make us feel that some emotions are bad. Yes, it is not. Emotions are neither good or bad, but a subjective reaction of us.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ogTUAbxRVOhUE-8K8spy7.png?height=276&width=442)\n\nBy analogy, it is not difficult to see from the definition of emotional management \"the management of your own reactions to the environment\" that the key to good emotional management lies in yourself, because it is a management of your own reactions, so It is said that you have 100% control over emotional management, and it depends on you, not on others. Many times, we often hear someone complaining after losing control of their emotions, \"If it wasn't for his attitude, I wouldn't have such impulsive actions.\" In fact, this sentence is just to find a reason for our loss of control. The remote control of management has always been in our own hands. Once you have a request for the response of the other party, you will unconditionally hand over the remote control of your emotions to the other party, so it is inevitable to lose control.\n\nThe colorful colors are derived from the three primary colors of red, green and blue. Although there are hundreds of expressions of emotions, they can be summarized into four basic emotions: joy, anger, sorrow, and fear.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cb94OE6aGjZbFDKfMh7v1.png?height=289&width=303)\n\nJoy and sadness are a pair of opposite emotions. When people achieve their desired goals and relieve tension and anxiety, the feeling of comfort is the emotional experience of joy; sadness is the emotional experience after the loss of the desired goal. Anger and fear are another pair of opposing emotions; usually when a person encounters an unpleasant thing, our autonomic nervous system will produce a flight or fight response, and when the opponent we encounter is stronger than us, we will take flight. , which is the emotional experience of fear; and when the other party is weaker than us, we will have war, which is the emotional experience of anger. Taking cats and mice as an example, an adult cat has 500 experience points for catching mice, and a weak mouse has 50 experience points against cats, so such a cat will immediately take an offensive stance; another cat has 100 experience points to fight against a cat. The mouse experience value is 150, then the cat may choose to avoid it; there is another cat with 300 experience value, and the mouse experience value of the battle is 250, then we will see the cat keep slapping the mouse with its paws , keep slapping until the mouse escapes without panting before attacking and winning. In our opinion, the third cat is playing with the mouse. If the third cat is injected with a tranquilizer, then this 300 experience is worth the cat will immediately Attack the mouse with 250 experience points, because the cat is slapping like this because it's scared. This is also understandable why drivers tend to lose control of their tempers. They can yell and make insulting gestures in the car when the traffic is not smooth. In fact, this is because people feel safe and fearless in the car, regardless of the situation.

Founder Anthony Scaramucci confirmed the move July 19 in an interview on CNBC, after Bloomberg reported it a day earlier citing anonymous sources. \n\n“Our board made the decision to temporarily suspend until we can raise capital inside the fund,” Scaramucci told CNBC. “The fund is unlevered, so there’s definitely no fear of any liquidation whatsoever and about 18% of the fund is in what we would call crypto exposure.” An independent board also took art in the decision, Scaramucci said.\n\nScaramucci mentioned Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) and FTX stock as examples of the fund’s crypto exposure. Among other crypto-related companies listed as investments on the Skybridge website, not specifically linked to Legion Strategies, are Kraken, NYDIG, Helium, Lightning and Genesis Digital Assets. Scaramucci said the Legion Strategies fund was down 30% year-to-date, but up 5% in July.\n\nLegion Strategies is an offshore fund based in the Cayman Islands that has about $250 million in it, according to Scaramucci. It is one of the smaller funds run by the company. This was the first time the fund had been suspended since its founding in 1994. Skybridge itself was founded in 2005.\n\nScaramucci told CNBC:\n\n> “Everybody signed an investor agreement, this type of flexibility, so I don’t think there are any surprises here given what’s going on in the overall market.”\n\nSkybridge is among the financial services companies that have [applied to list a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-rejects-skybridge-s-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf)and been rejected by the United Sates Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n***Related: [Scaramucci sees bright future for crypto but ‘very worried’ about US politicians](https://cointelegraph.com/news/scaramucci-sees-bright-future-for-crypto-but-very-worried-about-us-politicians)***\n\nSkybridge made its first investments in Bitcoin in late 2020 and announced in April that [it was repositioning itself](https://cointelegraph.com/news/skybridge-goes-all-in-on-crypto-betting-on-tremendous-growth-ahead) to “eventually be a leading cryptocurrency asset manager and adviser.”", "timestamp": 1658282254, "digest": "vNtp_nUr4E5dFGfYZAI2t3ExiJpkGJMPzbrVNetiXnY", "contributor": "0x43BB172927116E0E5713A957A581E621762AEe2C"}

Under Bian Que's meticulous care, their illnesses recovered in no time. However, Bian Que said to Gong Hu and Qi Ying, \"The diseases you both sought to treat in the past were caused by the intrusion of pathogens from outside the body into the internal organs, so only medicine and acupuncture can solve the problem. God, I found out that there is still a disease lurking in you. It was brought out of your mother's womb and grew along with your body's development. This disease is very dangerous. I would like to treat you again, how about it?\"\nGong Hu and Qi Ying replied, \"We want to hear about the symptoms of this disease, and then make a decision.\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/22Axqee-imUpjpraoVcpN.png?height=270&width=232)\n\n\nTherefore, Bian Que first said to Gong Hu: \"You have lofty ambitions, and you are good at thinking about problems. You can have many ways to deal with problems, but unfortunately, your temperament is relatively weak, and you are often indecisive, hesitant, and lost at critical moments. Good opportunity.\" Then, he turned to Qi Ying: \"What about you? It's the exact opposite of Gong Hu. You lack long-term plans for the future, your thoughts are relatively simple, but your temperament is very strong, and you don't think much about others, but you like to act arbitrarily. Finally, Bian Que said to the two of them: \"Now if I exchange your hearts, you will all be perfect.\"\nAfter listening to Bian Que's analysis, Gong Hu and Qi Ying were both willing to undergo a heart transplant. So, Bian Que made them both drink a kind of narcotic wine, causing them to fall into a coma and not wake up for three days. During this time, Bian Que opened their chests, took out their hearts, and exchanged them. After the operation, the magic medicine was applied to the wound, and when they recovered, they were still as healthy and strong as before the operation. After they said goodbye to Bian Que together, they went home separately.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Ei0IzueyAUdja31wQY50.png?height=276&width=330)\n\n\nHowever, because the hearts have been exchanged, Gong Hu returned to Qi Ying's house, and Qi Ying returned to Gong Hu's house. The wives and children of the two families did not know the people who came home, so they all quarreled. Gong Hu and Qi Ying couldn't think of it, so they had to ask Bian Que to explain. Bian Que told the two families the whole story, so that the quarrel could be put to rest.\nThis fable is borrowing the name of the genius doctor Bian Que, using the metaphor of heart-changing, to show that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.

Persistence 团队将与 Keplr、Cosmostation、Coin98 和 Citadel 等钱包团队通力合作，以确保 Persistence Core-1 链的新用户仅注册到代币类型 118。 \n\n   b. 我们将为现有用户提供接口，方便现有用户在与应用和链的交互中继续使用代币类型 750，直到用户迁移到代币类型 118。\n\n   c. 进行与代币类型以及迁移至 118 相关的推广教育。\n2. 在用户端进行从代币类型 750 至代币类型 118 的迁移：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZIB4wp7h9J0mYv3AWhEJh.png?height=813&width=2048)\n\n1. 新用户：无需任何操作 \n2. 现有网页端/手机端钱包用户： \n\n   \\-代币类型118用户：无需操作 \n\n   \\-代币类型750用户：创建一个新钱包并将您的代币迁移到新创建的钱包中 \n3. Ledger 用户：迁移到 Cosmos 应用程序 -代币类型118 \n4. 质押 XPRT 的用户： \n\n   \\-迁移建议：在 Iqlusion 上线流动性质押模块后（暂定2022年第三季度末），无需解除质押即可直接将质押代币转移至新的代币类型118钱包地址。 \n\n   \\-即时解决方案：将您的 XPRT 解除质押并迁移到新创建的代币类型 118 钱包地址。\n\n将代币类型从 750 迁移至 118 的提案一旦通过，在接下来的几个月的迁移期内，团队保证将为无缝迁移提供全部必要的支持及指导。 \n\n同时，Persistence钱包以及合作钱包还将在未来很长一段时间内支持代币类型750，以确保全部用户都顺利迁移至代币类型118。 \n\n**注意:** 我们预计将在2024年12月不再支持代币类型750的钱包。 \n\n代币类型迁移的核心目的是为 Persistence 生态系统成员提供最佳用户体验。随着项目的成熟，我们一直在不断努力提供以用户为核心的产品，而这需要我们不断的进行迭代发展。 \n\n只有在社区、验证者和合作项目的不断反馈、支持和通力合作之下，我们才能实现预定的目标。我们朝着更佳的用户体验前进的每一步都将让我们离成为 PoS 生态系统的流动性质押中心这一目标更进一步。\n\n## 拓展参考资料：\n\n* 衍生路径: <https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/derivation-paths> \n* BIP44 标准: <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki>\n* 代币类型 118: <https://medium.com/chainapsis/keplr-explained-coin-type-118-9781d26b2c4e>\n* IBC 信息面板: <https://mapofzones.com>\n\n**P.S.** 感谢 Chainapsis 团队对代币类型 118 的研究，辅助构建了本篇文章以及相关的关键信息。", "timestamp": 1658282126, "digest": "FtJOMT-OpDk_Gn7rm2_BGoiziJ8qGEvcg8vCcFCXezQ", "contributor": "0xd92b5bd0048dc13469FBE17EdE75Aa5AA91f9296"}

Founder Anthony Scaramucci confirmed the move July 19 in an interview on CNBC, after Bloomberg reported it a day earlier citing anonymous sources. \n\n“Our board made the decision to temporarily suspend until we can raise capital inside the fund,” Scaramucci told CNBC. “The fund is unlevered, so there’s definitely no fear of any liquidation whatsoever and about 18% of the fund is in what we would call crypto exposure.” An independent board also took art in the decision, Scaramucci said.\n\nScaramucci mentioned Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) and FTX stock as examples of the fund’s crypto exposure. Among other crypto-related companies listed as investments on the Skybridge website, not specifically linked to Legion Strategies, are Kraken, NYDIG, Helium, Lightning and Genesis Digital Assets.

{"id": "aojIGZXGkuXmsUIya87m0KJHBMJZUAAZHxwwrnq0ycE", "title": "One tree becomes wood, ten trees become firewood", "body": "In the early 1890s, in Houston, the southern United States, the cotton billionaire William Marshall Rice donated money to establish Rice University, which is one of the earliest private schools in the United States.\n\nWhen the campus was built, Rice stipulated that not a single oak tree on the original site should be moved, and it should be carefully fortified. From the construction of the school to the completion of the school, there are no less oak trees, a total of 689 trees.\n\nAs a result, the school recruited 689 students in the first year.\n\nPeople don't understand. Some people say that Rice has a problem with nerves, because according to the size of the school, it can recruit at least 1,000 students. Private schools, on the other hand, are supported by tuition fees, and there is no difference between a teacher teaching 50 students and 100 students.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9ixZCSeEK4PkrlzE7hSZ0.png?height=270&width=367)\n\nRice continued to ask teachers and students to cultivate oak trees and new oak trees in sections until the campus was \"saturated\". If oak trees are in the way of infrastructure land, oak trees must be transplanted to another part of the campus at any cost, and they must be guaranteed to survive, or enrollment must be reduced accordingly the following year.\n\nIf the enrollment plan for the next year increases, the first thing the school has to do is to plant a corresponding number of oak trees. If unfortunately some do not survive, a corresponding number of students will be unlucky.\n\nAt this time, some people seem to have realized something, while more people are more puzzled, and some people even say that Rice may be an \"oak spirit\".\n\nBy 1902, the campus was finally \"saturated\" with 4,890 oak trees. At this time, Rice, who was seriously ill, made a rule: no matter when, the number of students in the school should not exceed 4,890.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YaSY-tY4jLnOHKz3fw0xD.png?height=270&width=405)\n\nAfter his death, people saw that Rice University became famous and became \"Harvard in the South of the United States\", and people erected a statue for him, \"the supreme pioneer of American private schools\".\n\nUntil 2008, there were 4,890 lush oak trees on the 325-hectare campus, and the total number of students in the school was 4,850, slightly less than the total number of oaks. In public schools, the 325-hectare campus has at least 9,000 students.\n\nMore than 100 years later, no matter how the times change, no matter how the economy develops, the number of students at Rice University is always less than the number of oak trees. There has been no question or objection to Mr Rice's rule.\n\nIn fact, the reason is very simple. Of course, the results of growing one tree in one square meter and growing 10 trees in one square meter are different: one tree becomes wood, and 10 trees become firewood. Regarding the possibility of personalized education for teachers on stage, the teaching effect of a classroom with 20 students and 50 students is of course different.\n\nIt's a simple truth, but there are always too many people who can't imitate it - the truth is also very simple: it is caused by the desire for profit.\n\nRice University only restricts the number of students. For world-class experts and scholars who are interested in teaching, it not only refuses to come, but also takes the initiative to throw \"hydrangea\" to them. The total number of students is less than 5,000, but the total number of teachers exceeds 500, and the teacher-to-student ratio is greater than 1:10.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qV0muijlmghrsjc_6aDcH.png?height=270&width=289)\n\nIn the 2007 U.S. university rankings, from the 1st to the 21st place are all private universities, and only from the 22nd place are public universities. At No. 22 is the public University of California, Berkeley, which is also far from No. 21 in strength.\n\nAccording to the 2010 National University Rankings, Rice University ranked 17th. It is a public university with its close proximity to the University of Texas, but it cannot be compared with Rice University in terms of academic level.\n\nThere are many unchangeable laws in nature.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GUBssrs47m64OD9vU5Bta.png?height=270&width=342)\n\nOn the same piece of land, the oak trees that can thrive are limited, and the number of students a university can accommodate is also limited, breaking the harmony between students, teachers and school-running conditions, the decline of teaching quality and the decline of school reputation will inevitably, eventually It affects the long-term development of the school. In fact, Rice University takes the oak tree as its teacher and follows the objective laws of nature, and longevity is inevitable.", "timestamp": 1658282430, "digest": "rkCNwyrKyi73AXZFqBlVZf8euVFYmAs-RuK0qezFWYU", "contributor": "0x14bd6177124529E8409993fBf08DDB0702695730"}

He has a stable job, but also has his parents who love him. He does not worry about food, clothing, or lack of love. However, he always felt that he had endless troubles, entangled in his heart, unable to break free or escape.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k__liI4CFCrXxRi4cKhrI.png?height=270&width=376)\n\nHow can people be so troubled? Young people are confused. One day, when he met a wise man, he expressed the confusion in his heart, hoping to get enlightenment.\n\nAfter listening to the wise man, he smiled slightly and said, \"The secular world, the wine pond and the meat forest, the human dance in the red dust, the famous locks and the locks, everything is tempting and confusing people. If you want to move, you will be excited, and you will naturally be troubled. Gains and losses, glory and shame, ups and downs... The more you care, the more painful your heart will be; on the contrary, the more you give up, the more peaceful your heart will be. \"Let go\" is to eliminate the root cause of troubles.\n\nThe young man nodded, if he understood something.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BQEGTouCkjVSpp5KsQMFZ.png?height=286&width=460)\n\nAnother day, he met a philanthropist. It is said that the philanthropist once made a lot of money, but then donated the money to others. Now, he lives happily.\n\nThe young man told the philanthropist his confusion again, hoping to get an answer from him.\n\nThe philanthropist said, I have had the same pain as you. However, since I learned to pay attention to others and to love others, the pain in my heart disappeared. Love is really an oar given to us by God, it can ferry us beyond the sea of ​​misery.\n\nA selfish person will not get great pleasures in life. Only those who have love in their hearts can create ripples of infinite happiness in the echo of love. Sharing the pain of others can also relieve your own pain; showing your own warmth will also receive the warm gift of others. This is the magical power of love.\n\nYes, troubles, more often, are the result of selfishness. When a person has others in his heart and loves others, troubles will be lessened.\n\nThe words of a philanthropist make young people feel like they can see the sun through the clouds.\n\nOnce again, the unit organized a trip, and the young man saw an old woman pounding rice in a farm household. While pounding rice, she hummed a folk song. Looks very happy.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/StyiONxVh7g7jmObGno-W.png?height=270&width=390)\n\nHe also shared his confusion to the old woman, hoping to get a different answer from her.\n\ntrouble? The old woman frowned and looked at the young man and said, \"I have been working from morning to night. I have been busy all my life. As long as I am working, I am singing and I am happy. I don't have time to worry.\n\nThe old woman paused and said to herself, maybe, only people who are free will be troubled.\n\nThinking of the words of wise men and philanthropists in the past, at that moment, young people suddenly became enlightened: It turned out that this world, unable to let go, no love in the heart, and boredom, will all be the source of troubles, and no matter what it is, it will become a spiritual source. The quagmire makes a person miserable.\n\nWhen the young man understands this, it is natural that he also finds a happy direction in life.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ejh5Am_Vk7xkCf5EakrzE.png?height=274&width=441)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658282704, "digest": "uaJF57WgpX1RvEESePVFSqQ_uC9KZ4Rhlq5Tb0RjAoA", "contributor": "0x14bd6177124529E8409993fBf08DDB0702695730"}

{"id": "MZaN6pIGtbrqN336Na6QGRDuDz4Eyz7rxYJmx2OQFxo", "title": "#Winning", "body": "This week I had planned to write on the topic of doxing, or more specifically, about the question of “to dox or not to dox”, and the choice for, or against, web3 anonymity. As inspired as I initially felt to explore it, once I sat down to outline it the work began to feel like a grind. Then, as I often do these days when feeling stuck, I turned my attention to twitter for a daily download of crypto news and DAOist musings. Somewhere in my feed, from someone I had never heard of, there appeared the following,\n\n“You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.\nThat’s why every quarter, I evaluate myself and my friends on 3 key criteria:\n\n* Income\n* Fitness\n* Influence\n\nAnyone who scores below me is cut off.\nComplacency is the first step towards mediocrity.”\n\nA day later, though I don’t recall all the details of my reaction, I think it a safe bet it included some combination of a furrowed brow, my best [gas face](https://slangdefine.org/g/gas-face-13ec.html) and nausea.  All of that before I fired back with the first thing to come to mind as a counter blow.\n\n“Congratulations on a life devoid of either giving or receiving unconditional love. You’re winning though. 👊”\n\n[https://twitter.com/HAshBrown_27/status/1548437771974348801?s=20&t=4QqD9qeeewCOpN7zYUJ16g](https://twitter.com/HAshBrown_27/status/1548437771974348801?s=20&t=4QqD9qeeewCOpN7zYUJ16g)\n\nSoon after that I turned off my computer and went out for the day. Honestly, I don’t think it occurred to me that I would even look at the tweet again. To the contrary, as someone new to twitter this year, I expected my response would go largely ignored, joining my 20-or-so other tweets in the land of twitter oblivion. To my surprise though, when I returned home several hours later, I noticed my twitter notification bell ringing, alerting me to the fact that my response had close to 200 likes. 20 hours later that number is now up to 488. Not that I’m counting.\n\nI’m new to this twitter thing, and as far as “likes” are concerned, have only facebook likes of posts of my kids, mountain views and fishing pictures to compare it to. 488 likes seems like a lot though. So while it may be small potatoes to seasoned tweeters with big followings, I’m a babe in the woods here, feeling pretty proud of that 488 thank you very much. Ooh, lookie there, just shot past 500. Am I going viral? LFG!!!\n\nSeriously though, upon looking into the phenomena of my most-liked social media entry ever, I see the person I responded to has a lot of followers. 6,075 to be exact. And digging a little deeper I realize he likely intended his tweet as satire. Gas face rescinded. Perhaps the joke is on me for responding to it.\n\nSatire or not, and irrespective of whether his friendship circles have anything to do with crypto and Web3, [@_mihir](https://twitter.com/__mihir?s=20&t=iOpvhasWZtEkPYiiXfkDYw) points to something very concerning to me about Web3 culture and the playing field of web3 identity. Playas gonna play. So how will Web3 define winning?\n\nBefore we get into all that I sense some context would be helpful.  A man in my early 50’s, I am at most a social media dabbler. I have a facebook page that I post on occasionally and to keep up with the lives of my 926 friends. I have created a few blogs over the years that I have enjoyed writing on but never broadcasted. Instagram? Ohhh hellll no….except to check in on the lives of my college-age children. I regard the notion of creating a web “identity” as near hostile to my bias for real-life interaction with others and time outdoors. And other than a short list of physical ailments, I can’t think of anything I’d like less than “followers”.\n\nSo what am I doing here worrying and writing about Web3 culture?  Fair question. What can I say except [orange pills](https://ryanslot.substack.com/p/what-it-means-to-be-orange-pilled#details) are a thing. [Green pills](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylewestaway/2022/06/16/how-crypto-can-regenerate-the-world/?sh=7ed83b602fd3) too. I’ve fallen down a [crypto rabbit hole](https://garywoodfine.com/going-down-the-crypto-rabbit-hole/) and I can’t get up!\n\nThe truth is that while I wrestle with mixed emotions about getting involved, I am thankful for crypto’s role in opening my mind (🤯) and luring me beyond my comfort zone.  For every horror story of greed, theft and exploitation related to this new frontier, I find most of what I read about the space to be inspiring.  To quote the immortal words of Buffalo Springfield, [“Somethings Happening Here”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQUj56sqicU), 2020’s style, and most days I want to be a part of it.\n\nOne example of this is an article, [“The Future of Work”](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-future-of-work), by David Hoffman. David makes a strong case for why Digital Organizations (DO’s), enabled by the blockchain and tokenized incentives, will present unprecedented opportunities for humans to coordinate both our hearts’ and minds’ shared interests to do purposeful work together.  Among the many lines to strike a chord with me David writes,\n\n“If you are a young person, looking for purpose, meaning, and eventually a salary, establishing yourself as a strong DOer is one of the best footholds you can establish for yourself….If you believe DOs are the future, you should start DOing now, so that you become the scarce resource for both DOs and people who need help DOing.”\n\nRelative to the audience David likely had in mind I am not a “young person”. That said, aside from a rather curmudgeonly attitude toward social media, I pride myself at being young in spirit. I am DOing (and DAOing) now and, in time, aspire to be among the scarce, most valued resources of the space. So what game am I playing? And what was it about @_mihir”s tweet that bothered me so?\n\nThough it has been over 20 years since I worked as an equity analyst at an investment brokerage firm, that work, and my short time in the industry, taught me some valuable lessons. The most memorable of them is the difference between the “game” of judging companies’ worth on the basis of quarterly performance vs. that of valuing them (or not) on the basis of fundamental strengths relative to longer-term investment horizons. The former game is played to generate transactions that pay brokers and their firms. The latter is played to maximize investors’ returns.\n\nWeb3 playing fields, DOs and DAOs included, will create whole new worlds from which to relate to the earth, token projects, and one another. There will be more games to go around than anyone can count in the space’s many arenas. Short-term trading, of crypto and people, can be fun, even profitable.

{"id": "naOam-pVShVNASvNBipFIBALEFGXfRWzEtZ_rCA94lg", "title": "秒杀黑洞的类星体，光芒贯穿半个宇宙，会撕裂银河系？", "body": "在我们的认知当中，黑洞应该可以被称得上是整个宇宙中最为危险的天体之一。**由于黑洞本身的质量极大，因此它可以产生几乎一种无法逆转的吸引力。**大型的黑洞甚至可以在一段时间内把一整个星系吞噬殆尽，甚至连光线也无法逃离黑洞的捕捉。\n\n但是在科学家们的研究过程中，人们逐渐发现了一种新的天体，这种天体相较于黑洞更为恐怖和神秘，它的名字就叫做**类星体**……\n\n### 宇宙中的类星体\n\n从类星体这个名字当中，**我们就可以看出这是一种与星体结构类似，但却并非是真正意义上“星”的天体。**\n\n简单来说，类星体的结构与我们认知当中的恒星极为类似，**但它们却在某些方面与恒星有着显著的区别**，它们并不像恒星一样可以将自身的物质和进行压缩成一个球形，**只是以一种近乎于缥缈的状态存在于宇宙当中。**\n\n而**类星体与恒星最为相似的地方，就是二者都能向外发射一种电波。**\n\n我们也可以**把这种电波称之为射电源，恒星与类星体发射的射电源，在宇宙当中可谓是极其常见**，我们每天都能通过射电望远镜观测到这种电波的存在。**而那些我们无法弄清来源的射电波，其实就是来自于类星体。**\n\n从这些描述当中，**我们能够看得出类星体是一种在宇宙当中极为特殊的存在**，但它的天体属性从单纯的描述来说无论怎样也称不上是恐怖，为什么天文学家们会对其感到畏惧呢？\n\n### 类星体的三大恐怖之处\n\n类星体的**第一大恐怖之处就是它的亮度**，2**015年，我国的天文工作者们发现了一个巨型的类星体**，这个类星体距离我们的地球足足有**128亿光年**的距离。\n\n按理来说，在这样遥远的距离之下，任何物质都是难以被观测到的。而天文学家们之所以能够轻而易举的发现类星体，就是因为它的亮度实在是太过惊人，**根据数据分析，该类星体的亮度可以达到太阳的420万亿倍。**\n\n**正因如此，我们才能够跨越100多亿光年的距离来对其进行观测。**\n\n科学家们还发现：**类星体在宇宙当中的红移值都很高**，也就是说，**它们与地球之间的距离其实是在不断被拉长的**。如果我们的地球距离一个类星体过近的话，很有可能会对地球上的人类产生重大的影响。\n\n类星体的**第二大恐怖之处就是其内部所蕴含的能量**，类星体的体型放在宇宙当中其实并不算大，一般都不会超过普通的星系，但是，**一个类星体内部所蕴藏的能量却要比普通的星系高上几千亿倍。**\n\n从很大程度上来说，**类星体之所以能够有如此大的能量效应，是因其超高的亮度。**\n\n如果我们把一块光伏电池板放置在距离类星体只有1亿公里的地方，**我们只需要从中接受一秒钟的光能，所接收到的能量总数就可以在理论上帮助人类的0.72级文明突破到二级文明。**\n\n但这样的想法终究无法实现，因为**类星体周边的能量物质运动太不稳定，如果真的把探测器送到离它这么近的位置，无疑是自寻死路。**\n\n类星体的**第三大恐怖之处是其违背物理学常识的运动速度。**“物质的运动速度无法超过光速”是物理学界一个不争的事实，但是**科学家们在观测类星体上的物质运动史，却发现其分离速度达到了288万公里/秒。**\n\n直到今天也没有人能够说清类星体内部如此剧烈的物质运动和超高的速度转换究竟是什么原因。\n\n### “秒杀”黑洞的天体\n\n在天文学界**，类星体可以被称之为是能够秒杀黑洞的天体**。与黑洞一样，**类星体也有着对于周围物质的吞噬能力**，而且在类星体中心一般都有着一个巨星的黑洞存在，也就是说：**这两者之间是一种包含与被包含的关系。**\n\n**在黑洞的帮助之下，类星体会吞噬周边的物质，并且在吞噬的过程中不断旋转物质产生摩擦**，类星体的发光原理基本上就可以被归类于物质摩擦时所产生的光能和热能。在这个过程中，**类星体甚至还能向外传送大量的热能辐射以及射线光波。**\n\n所以不论从哪个角度来说，**类星体在宇宙当中的毁坏力都是要高于黑洞的，因为黑洞自身的运动速率并不算快，而类星体却可以以一种超快的速度在宇宙当中横行霸道，**吞噬周边的一切物质。\n\n### 人类是否会受到影响？\n\n那么我们人类是否会受到类星体这种天体的影响呢？这个问题的答案是暂时否定的，因为宇宙中的类星体距离我们都十分遥远，**哪怕放任不管，它们也要足足花上几十亿甚至几百亿年的时间才能够来到可能对地球产生威胁的位置。**\n\n我们的**太阳系正处在一个难得的稳定期，人类可以在这个时间段大力谋求自身的发展。**目前的科学界普遍认为，类星体是整个宇宙当中毁坏力最为惊人的天体，它的出现以及高速运动在某种意义上限制了宇宙生命的发展。\n\n**如果整个宇宙空间内没有类星体这种物质的存在，取而代之的就会是大量的恒星以及星系结构，生命也就能更容易的产生了。**", "timestamp": 1658282573, "digest": "MTrsBfBTiTmCgck00JCqzYiH6jL5o9mynplJEf192wk", "contributor": "0xb3a1316BcD2bE65F2Ba67740946E8F01c0E1311E"}

That is, registering ENS domains containing names of prominent entities beforehand and then later demanding a high price for the domain should the said entity wishes to enter the Web 3.0 space later on.\n\nSince its inception in 2017, there have been over 1.67 million .eth domain registrations across approximately 482,000 owners. More than 154,100 registrations were made recentl between July 5 to July 18, partly due to [lower gas fees](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-name-service-registrations-surge-by-200-amid-lower-gas-fees) and continued interest from entities seeking to enter the Web 3.0 space. To date, the ENS collection on OpenSea has witnessed approximately 46,200 ETH ($71.5 million) in cumulative transaction volume. ", "timestamp": 1658282391, "digest": "-pAwMwTaWlCAVe9zq2xys5OMz8E3TGWvnAYJkzgtsSo", "contributor": "0x9B3492b79E45b21156eE02Daec63af6d1B7368b4"}

Even so, I still enjoy writing.\n\nI especially enjoy writing when I'm feeling down. Because at that time, my sense of touch was the most sensitive, my thinking was also very active, and my thinking ability would also be enhanced. Even the editing and expression of words were far better than usual. I was able to get into the state of writing very well, I might even say it was a good state.\n\nAt that time, I could travel from this real life to another virtual world. There, I was like a god, a god who could overturn clouds and rain, and be omnipotent. I control the fate of all people, whether happy or sad, fortunate or unfortunate. I immersed myself in it and enjoyed it happily.\n\nIn this real life, I always like to observe every person around me in detail and everything that happens to them. When I am alone, I slowly crumble them, reshape them, and sneak them into my novels.\n\nWhenever I see them dazed, confused, hesitant, helpless, tangled... irritable, my thoughts will become clearer and more organized.\n\nI thought to myself, how would I be if he (she) was. After empathy, I will deal with it rationally in my novel, and then arrange various plots, scenes and later changes.\n\nAt that moment, I forgot my true self. Even in real life, I have the same troubles as the storyteller, but at that time, I put them all aside. At that time, all my attention and energy were placed on the people and events in the story.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hssrKiQ-nCpfDIzo61E6D.png?height=280&width=448)\n\nA friend once talked to me about it, and he said, \"This state is called obsession.\"\n\nIn fact, I don't know myself, is this state of obsession or an escape?\n\nPerhaps, in this real life, I am a person who is melancholy and carries a lot of troubles. Entry to me is probably a way of getting out and getting away. Only in this way can I ignore the present moment and gain a temporary relief.\n\nA friend said: \"If this state is escapism, it is too narrow; if it is selflessness, it is very admirable; if it is obsession, then it is even more worthy of appreciation and praise.\"\n\nListening to his words, I laughed and teased him: \"It is very likely that I am still transforming in these states. These should be the process of my evolution...\"\n\nAfter chatting with him, I suddenly came to a realization.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cLfJbFMeOI2OUSb2dNlsM.png?height=266&width=465)\n\nPerhaps, many times, we can see ourselves as other people, both inside and outside the story. In the face of all the complicated and tricky things, we might as well step aside and be a quiet bystander emotionally and seriously, just like watching a movie or TV show. Finally, we combine objective vision, use rational thinking and the most effective way to solve problems.\n\nThen I think that when we have such thoughts, mentality and ability, we should be able to calmly face all the difficulties and various tests in life at any time.\n\nTherefore, the four words \"clouds and winds are light\", it no longer belongs to some people, we can also have it.", "timestamp": 1658284086, "digest": "a4W3Cjz08dgmUZqV7lN8uW7K8_9K1x4BGB7kCI78s1A", "contributor": "0xfE5d245154a4B93d296B3A8F9128e4fcC35DEb80"}

Listening to the rustling sound, I woke up a lot...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Za4UdjGyz0CCdPTP0Wdne.png?height=270&width=390)\n\nWhen it was almost dusk in the afternoon, the sun was about to set on the top of the mountain, and the afterglow of the sun shone on the bamboo forest outside the window. The sun is no longer so strong and harsh, but only a soft light is left. When I raised my head, I could look directly at the sun on the top of the mountain, instead of being unable to open my eyes in the sun like noon. By this time, the wind outside the window had not stopped since the early morning, but was more rapid, as if to catch up with the pace of the sun, so rapid that it could not stop for a moment. I could only hear the wind blowing the bamboo leaves and making a whistling sound. Not only the bamboo leaves were swaying, but the whole bamboo forest was shaking constantly. The whistling wind was accompanied by the rustling of bamboo leaves. The wind outside the window was so strong and powerful that it was desperately playing a majestic symphony. At this time, the wind outside the window was no longer so quiet, and the curtains were also jumping randomly, so I quickly got up and closed the window...\n\nWhen night fell, it was pitch black outside the window, and the dark night was only accompanied by stars. At this time, the wind outside the window has quieted down, it did not go, but just stayed quietly in the bamboo forest outside the window. But I clearly felt its presence, and it quietly entered the window. Touching my face under the light, I felt a chill, and I immediately recovered from being in a daze. And the bamboo forest under the light outside the window did not continue to play music, they were whispering in rustling, and slowly became quiet...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JGfN2VTnnVyZwy3aMImL1.png?height=266&width=456)\n\nIn the dead of night, I also slowly fell asleep under the caress of the wind outside the window. In my dream, there is a bamboo forest outside the window and the wind outside the window. I sit in front of the window, open the window, and quietly look at the bamboo forest outside the window. In fact, the bamboo forest outside the window is not alone, because Fenger has been accompanying them...", "timestamp": 1658284391, "digest": "4qxKRLloFbu3t3rvB0U4nlydI0CItyqMefehwz5x9KI", "contributor": "0xfE5d245154a4B93d296B3A8F9128e4fcC35DEb80"}

Founded by [Arisa Toyosaki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toyosaki/)(google/bitcoin.com), [Winston Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/winstonzhang/) (YC), [Victor Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhangvictorz/) (YC/Tesla) and [Felicia Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/feliciachen0/)(Anduril/Apple), a rockstar team. Their goal is to create high-yielding products with protection in mind for every person's financial security.\n\nTheir inaugural exotic options product is the Fixed Coupon Note. Fixed coupon notes (FCN) are a type of exotic option structured product that has both equity option and bond-like characteristics. You can learn more about their product [here](https://cega.gitbook.io/cega/products/overview/fcn/what-are-fixed-coupon-notes-fcn) \n\nTheir [product](http://cega.fi) has 3 yield offerings.\n\n![Cega's different yield pools](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Pk9fj7ENacKcl995cFWqt.png?height=1048&width=2626)\n\nThey just launched a couple days ago and already have $30M+ in TVL. The team is very clear about the risks and have different levels of APY depending on what you are comfortable with. \n\n# Allocating OrangeDAO’s treasury\n\nWe created a strategy/defi team that increases the yield the treasury of the DAO in a stable and secure way and also supports the protocols we invest in. \n\nAs a macro strategy for our treasury, we have a combination of different levels of risk going from Aave protocol to exotic options. \n\nOne of the frameworks we use to analyze these opportunities is the following:\n\n* Who is the team behind this?\n* Is this audited?\n* Do we understand the business risks behind the protocol?\n* TotalValueLocked\n\nCega was clearly a superb choice and decided to allocate part of our treasury in a combination of their different baskets.\n\nWe are looking for more yield opportunities, if you are building something please let us know at orlando@orangedao.xyz , alex@orangedao.xyz .\n\nWe want to be your first check and then one of your early adopters. 🍊\n\n*DISCLAIMER: None of this is financial advice.

AMMs are an important primitive in DeFi, as anyone can deposit their own tokens in an AMM LP, receiving a share of trading fees and the LP tokens in return.\n\nHow do AAMs differ from traditional finance? In the traditional trading model, buyers and sellers use something called an *order book*, where they write down what they want to trade in a huge list with everyone’s trades. The behavior of the buyers and sellers controls the market rates in the order book.\n\nAMMs do not rely on humans to manage trades, which are controlled directly by algorithms. An AMM replaces the buy and sell orders in an order book market with a liquidity pool of two assets, both valued relative to each other. As one asset is traded for the other, the relative prices of the two assets shift, and the new market rate for both is re-calculated. \n\nThe majority of AMMs use the *constant mean market maker equation *(also known as the constant product equation) to define how liquidity pools behave:\n\n```\nBalance of token A * Balance of token B = Constant product\n```\n\nFor example, in a pool with 2,000,000 tokens A and 1,000 tokens B, the constant product is 2,000,000,000. This inverse correlation then determines the trading price of the assets at any moment, as the price of one token increases when the price of the second token decreases:\n\n```\nMarket price for token A = Balance of token / Balance of  token A\n```\n\nThe price curve is often utilized as a way to visualize this relation:\n\nTo find the swap price for the assets in a given pool (i.e., the amount of **token A** received when you exchange a certain quantity of **token B**), we calculate the balances for each token that are needed in the pool to keep the constant product unchanged after the swap:\n\n```\nBalance of token A - Quantity of token A received = (Constant product) / (Balance of token B + Quantity of token B paid)\n```\n\nThe amount of **token A** received from this swap conveys the “buy price”, and it’s calculated from the relation above:\n\n```\nQuantity of token A received = (Balance of token A * Quantity of token B  paid) / (Balance of token B  +  Quantity of token B paid)\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## Enter Balancer\n\nLaunched in 2018, Balancer introduced a protocol for configurable liquidity on the Ethereum blockchain and other EVM-compatible systems. With Balancer, users are able to create liquidity pools with up to eight different ERC-20 tokens, in any ratio. These pools can be thought of as automatically *rebalancing portfolios*, providing traders with what can be called a *decentralized index fund.* \n\nBalancer routes several pools together, allowing easy trades from one token in one pool to any other token in another pool. These multi-asset pools work using what is called *weighted math*, designed to allow swaps between any asset whether or not they have a price correlation. Balancer's price equation is a generalization of the constant product equation, accounting for multi-tokens and weightings that are not evenly split, so that prices are determined by the pools’ balances and weights.\n\nBalancer’s core smart contract is called [“The Vault''](https://docs.balancer.fi/products/the-vault), and it controls and holds all tokens in each of the Balancer pools. The Vault’s architecture separates the *token accounting and management* from the *pool logic*, simplifying the pools’ contracts. In this architecture, [Balancer’s Protocol Swap Fees](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/fees) are the percentage of swap fees collected by pools defined on a contract named [ProtocolFeesCollector.sol](https://etherscan.io/address/0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F#readContract). These fees include flash loan fees, and they are adjusted through governance by the Balancer’s DAO. \n\n\n---\n\n## Balancer’s Flash Loan\n\nFlash Loans are special smart contract operations that allow the borrowing of any available amount of assets (up to the total liquidity) without collateral. This is possible as long as the liquidity plus interests are returned within one block transaction. If the borrower is unable to repay the loan, the entire transaction is simply reverted. \n\nA common use of flash loans is on arbitrage algorithms, searching for profit by trading an asset on a first DEX and then getting back the asset plus gains on other DEXs. \n\nIn the context of Balancer, a trader could borrow any amount of tokens available on The Vault to use on a flash loan. The logic for these types of transactions is specified in the [FlashLoans.sol](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8#code#F5#L20) contract, more specifically in the flashLoan function:\n\n1\\. This function starts with straightforward initializations, ensuring that the length of the token array and the amount array match, and assigning the zero address to the previousToken variable (to ensure the tokens are sorted and unique):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UREh_nf-SFXdGe8LCFFVz.png?height=472&width=1136)\n\n2\\. The first loop over the tokens’ array is used to record the pre-balance of each token, calculate the loan fees, and transfer each amount of token to the receiver.

{"id": "sFI6EFDmfn0pdkjimICnaCJXplZwP1ZePFfHoa5pIKo", "title": "解析 StarkNet 发币的影响：L2 竞争格局将会有何改变？", "body": "> StarkNet 开启 L2 生态军备竞赛，甚至将挑战以太坊统治地位。\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* StarkNet 发币或将加速 Arbitrum 发币进程。参考 Optimism 发币加速生态发展期间相关数据超过 Arbitrum 的历史经验，StarkNet 可能也同样会在一段时期内赢得对 Arbitrum 的竞争，加剧 Arbitrum 的竞争压力。\n* 短期来看，Optimism 兼容 EVM 背靠以太坊生态，支持相关开发工具，开发门槛低，项目移植难度低，相比 StarkNet 具有开发优势；Optimism 与 StartNet 市场份额差距较大，StarkNet 短期难以追赶。长期来看，StarkNet 的去中心化 PoS 机制将在与 Optimism 的中心化 MEVA 机制的竞争中胜出。\n* OPR 类项目具有内在的 MEVA 困境，StarkNet 的 PoS 机制能够限制 MEV，并且能够创造更高的收入天花板，具有代币经济壁垒，长期将在与 OPR 之争中胜出。\n* StarkNet 将通过捕获 gas 结算价值和截取网络流量的方式挑战以太坊统治地位。\n\n7 月，L2 生态发生的关键事件无疑是 L2 四大天王之一的 StarkNet 官宣代币提案。\n\n虽然，目前公布的代币提案中明确强调会向生态开发者空投大量代币，但没有明确提到「用户空投」相关字眼，让众多提前埋伏生态的撸毛党大失所望。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/l0wzggr4byxnbhik.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://medium.com/starkware/part-1-starknet-sovereignty-a-decentralization-proposal-bca3e98a01ef)*\n\n但作为估值高达 80 亿、还有 V 神、Naval、Multicoin、Coinbase 、Paradium、Tiger Global 等豪华资方站队的 L2 明星项目，StarkNet 对加密行业的影响将是全方位的。\n\n一方面，StarkNet 理论上可以在继承以太坊的安全性前提下将以太坊 TPS 从 15 提高到 10000+，将 gas 从小数点前一位数优化到后两位数，StarkNet 对加密网络的影响正如互联网从 3G 到 4G 的网络提速为之后的移动互联网生态爆发奠定基础一样，网络扩容将会极大推动整个网络生态的发展。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/yryo37azeaervwsy.png!heading)\n\n*来源：Xiang｜W3.Hitchhiker，以上计算前提是以当前 ETH  价格为 2500 U，区块 gaslimit 为 30,000,000，gas 费用为 30 Gwei，平均 13 秒的出块时间计算， 极限 TPS 指对应运行环境占领了所有以太坊区块空间 (在证明验证上花费 500,000 gas)，普通 TPS 指对应运行环境占领了所有以太坊 1/3 的区块空间。*\n\n另一方面，StarkNet 作为 L2 众多扩容项目中的一员，面临与 Arbitrum、Optimism、zkSync 等其他 L2 热门项目的竞争，L2 格局将会出现垄断还是共存尚未可知。\n\n本文将聚焦在 StarkNet 发币对 L2 赛道热门项目如 Arbitrum、Optimism 的影响以及对以太坊的挑战。对于 StarkNet 官宣发币计划，其他 L2 项目可能做出哪些应对措施？还没发币的 Arbitrum 会被迫提前发币参与竞争吗？StarkNet 如何解决以太坊以及 Optimistic Rollup 上的 MEV 问题？L2 的竞争格局将会有何改变？以太坊的地位会被削弱吗？\n\nStarkNet 是一个无需许可的去中心化 L2 ，旨在允许以太坊通过称为 STARKs 的加密协议进行扩展，同时不损害以太坊的去中心化、透明度、包容性和安全性的核心原则。它可以在不损失以太坊的可组合性和安全性的前提下提高 TPS 与降低 gas。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023945/2lo2gnrasturykqc.jpg!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://foresightnews.pro/article/detail/barnabe.substack.com)*\n\nL2 是描述一类特定的以太坊扩展解决方案的统称，是扩展以太坊并继承以太坊安全保证的独立区块链。根据底层技术的差异，L2 Rollup（汇总）方案主要可分为欺诈证明的 Optimistic Rollup（乐观汇总，下文简称 OPR）和有效性证明的 Zero Knowledge Rollup（零知识汇总，下文简称 ZKR）两类。StarkNet 是 Zero Knowledge Rollup 方案中的一种。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/zwwcpjbvtmekdxic.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GmHoX2iBBa-_TDC8_dH88g)*\n\nOptimistic Rollup 最热门的项目包括 Optimism、Arbitrum，Zero Knowledge Rollup 最热门的项目包括 StarkNet、zkSync。Optimism、Arbitrum、StarkNet、zkSync 也被称为 L2 四大天王。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19035210/yvfl999zdkn1a0by.png!heading)\n\n*TVL 数据[来源](https://l2beat.com/)（与后文 Arbitrum 部分数据源不一致）；用户数据[来源](https://dune.com/gm365/L2)；Optimism 估值来源：Messari，其他信息来自 Google*\n\n## 二、对 Arbitrum 的影响\n\nOPR 的 Optimism 在 5 月 31 日公布代币计划，6 月 1 日执行代币空投，ZKR 的 StarkNet 在 7 月 13 日公布代币计划，随着 L2 赛道中的两大竞争对手都推出代币计划，Arbitrum 可能会加速其代币进程。\n\n首先回顾 Optimism 发币事件对 Arbitrum 的影响。\n\nArbitrum 与同属 OPR 路线的 Optimism 存在一定差距。截至 7 月 18 日，Arbitrum 的 TVL 达到 10.4 亿美元，占 L2 总市场份额达到 69.84%，Opimism 的 TVL 达到 3.89 亿美元，市场份额达到 26.06%，Arbitrum 暂时领先 Optimism。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19031550/kpnzdkg5raslnpkk.png!heading)\n\n*数据[来源](https://defillama.com/chains/Rollup)*\n\n但 Optimism 在 5.31 公布代币计划，6.1 执行空投之前的 TVL 占比仅有 14.37%。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19031610/ic08joceb78kyzzi.png!heading)\n\n*数据[来源](https://defillama.com/chains/Rollup)*\n\n自发币至 7 月 19 日，Optimism 在 L2 中的 TVL 份额从 14.37% 上升至 26.06%，同期 Arbitrum 的 TVL 份额从 80.80% 下降至 69.84%。\n\n以下图表进一步展示了在 Optimism 在发行代币并执行空投的 50 天内（截至 7 月 19 日）Optimism 与 Arbitrum 生态发展的对比情况。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19041243/mu0b6t1nfrvemt0m.png!heading)\n\n*[来源](https://dune.com/maxlion/l2-overview)*\n\n该图表通过对比 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 的用户与 TVB 数据，显示了 Optimism 空投代币事件 50 天内用户和资金的增长。\n\n左上角图表显示最近 50 天 Arbitrum 的用户数量，近 50 天 Arbitrum 的用户达到 67,776；左下角图标显示最近 50 天 Optimism 的用户数量，近 50 天 Optimism 的用户数量达到 75,497。Optimism 同期用户数量超过 Arbitrum 11.4%。\n\n右上角图标显示最近 50 天 Arbitrum 的 TVB，近 50 天桥接到 Arbitrum 的资产达到 55,929 个 ETH；右下角图表显示最近 50 天 Optimism 的 TVB，近 50 天桥接到 Optimism 的资产达到 62,209 个 ETH。Optimism 同期 TVB 领先 Arbitrum 11.2%。\n\n我们可以发现，Optimism 在推出 OP 代币并空投之后的 50 天内，Optimism 的用户数量与 TVB 均超过 Arbitrum，可以得知 Optimism 的生态发展与推出代币计划存在正相关性。Optimism 发行代币并执行空投的举措推动了生态发展并在一段时间内领先了与对手 Arbitrum 的竞争。\n\n根据 Optimism 发币对 Arbitrum 的成功竞争经验，我们可以试着做出以下推理：\n\n* 前提 1：发行代币并执行空投的举措可以推动生态发展并在一段时间内赢得竞争。\n* 前提 2：StarkNet 是 Arbitrum 的竞争对手。\n* 前提 3：StarkNet 即将发行代币并执行空投。\n\n结论：StarkNet 将在一段时间内赢得与 Arbitrum 的竞争。\n\n我们也许可以预见随着 StarkNet 发行代币并执行空投计划，StarkNet 的用户、开发者、TVL/TVB、应用数量将会迎来一段时期的增长，从而抢夺 L2 市场份额，增加 Arbitrum 的竞争压力从而加速其发币进程。\n\n## 三、对 Optimism 的影响\n\nStarkNet 的发币与空投对 Optimism 生态影响有限。Optimism 背靠 EVM 生态以及既有的 DeFi 市场份额，StarkNet 短期难以撼动 Optimism 地位。\n\nOptimism 兼容 EVM，支持 EVM 工具，对大量的以太坊开发者而言进入 Optimism 开发应用难度较低，主网应用移植难度也低。而 StarkNet 原生的 zkVM 不兼容 EVM，StarkNet 的 Cairo 语言及其相关开发工具也阻碍以太坊开发者进入 StarkNet 生态。\n\n与此同时，Optimism 相比 StarkNet 占据更大的 DeFi 市场，TVB 达到 178,719 ETH，StarkNet 的 TVB 仅有 545 ETH。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023945/hd7h17n7zjyrhm0t.png!heading)\n\n*数据[来源](https://dune.com/gm365/L2)*\n\n但长期来看由于 OPR 固有的代币经济困境，Optimism 将持续依赖 MEVA（最大可提取价值拍卖）作为收入来源。而 StarkNet 的代币提案明确指出不将 MEVA 作为网络收入，并将推动排序器去中心化运营，逐步建立 PoS 机制，Optimism 的 MEVA 收入将落后于 StarkNet 的 PoS 收入，打破长期存在于 OPR 类项目中的 MEVA 困境。\n\n下文将深入分析 OPR 中面临的 MEVA 困境与 StarkNet 的 PoS 创新。\n\n## 四、OPR 的 MEVA 困境\n\nStarkNet 的 PoS 机制能够打破包括 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 在内的 OPR 项目的 MEVA 困境。\n\n在像以太坊这样的 L1 网络上，区块链矿工（也称为验证者、区块生产者或聚合者）名义上通过区块奖励和交易费用获得收入。但作为一个负责生产特定区块的区块生产者，它可以在该区块的范围内拥有很大的权力，比如可以任意重新排序交易，在其他交易之前插入自己的交易，并将原交易完全延迟到下一个区块。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023945/g7pj9iq0yaqzd65s.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-auction-auctioning-transaction-ordering-rights-as-a-solution-to-miner-extractable-value/6788)*\n\n和 L1 的情况类似，在 L2 上，L2 的排序器类似 L1 上的矿工 / 节点，拥有对交易排序的权力，排序器可以选择优先执行有更高 gas 价格的事务以获得额外利润，该额外利润称为 MEV（Maximal/Miner Extractable Value，最大可提取价值）。对排序权拍卖的行为叫做 MEVA（Maximal/Minter Extractable Value Auction）。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19031849/8i2emk6wpywh5ut7.jpg!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://foresightnews.pro/article/detail/barnabe.substack.com)*\n\n举例：小明发起交易需要支付 n 个单位的 gas，当套利者发现了交易信息，就可以通过向排序器支付 n+x 个 gas 从而优先获得交易权，套利者可以再把该交易以 n+x+y 个单位的价格卖回小明，套利者获得 y 个 gas 的利润，小明多支付了 x+y 的 gas，排序器额外获得了 x+y 的收入。假如小明在该笔交易中获得的最大收入是 m，出于功利目的，只要 m>=n+x+y，小明仍然愿意支付 n+x+y 的 gas，理论上套利者最多将原价为 n 的 gas 推高到 m。\n\n以下是 MEV 近年来的的增长曲线：\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/nylz362dd49vijdm.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://explore.flashbots.net/)*\n\n### MEVA 的危害\n\n如前所述，MEV 的存在理论上一方面可以无限推高用户成本，直到达到用户愿意为该交易支付的最高价格，伤害用户的应用体验，另一方面额外发起的套利交易也会占用链上 TPS 增加网络负担造成网络拥堵。而 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 都通过中心化运营排序器（类比 L1 节点）的方式将 MEVA 并作为收入来源，这还将加剧中心化的运营风险。\n\n### MEVA 的困境\n\n从代币供应角度来看，如果固定 OPR 代币供应，并将链上 gas 以 OPR 代币结算，这将会不断消耗 OPR 代币，不断抬高 gas 价格，L2 失去意义，用户和资金将会逃离。如果循环供应，需要设计代币铸造机制，引入 PoW 或者 PoS 并推动排序器去中心化运营，但这与 OPR 中心化排序器的现实相矛盾。Optimism 和 Arbitrum 都将 MEV 作为主要的收入来源，形成财政依赖之后就需要继续保证排序器中心化以获得 MEV 收益。\n\n简而言之，Arbitrum 和 Optimism 等 OPR 项目的 MEV 困境就是：由于依赖 MEV 收入，只能中心化运营排序器，而中心化运营排序器无法实现去中心的代币供应，无法推动去中心化的 PoS 或 PoW 共识机制，使得用户成本高体验差、网络负担大、具有中心化运营风险。\n\n而 StarkNet 代币提案中提到的在 L2 上建立的 PoS 机制将会破解存在于 OPR 项目中的 MEVA 难题。\n\n## 五、StarkNet 的 PoS 创新\n\n长久以来 PoS 作为 L1 项目的共识机制被人们熟知，StarkNet 是第一个采用 PoS 的 L2 Rollup 项目。采用 PoS 的 StarkNet 作为一个 L2 项目可以打破长期存在于 L2 上的 MEVA 困境，降低用户支付成本，改善平台体验，缓解网络拥堵情况，还将极大提高 L2 收入上限。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/zvu1tteu6ddur91c.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-stake)*\n\n### 限制 MEV\n\nStarkNet 的 PoS 机制可以通过质押与共识规则限制 MEV。\n\n在过去，关于 L2 排序器的运营方式包括两种思路：\n\n* 集中排序器，像 Optimism 和 Arbitrum 这样的中心化排序器运营商通过拍卖获得全部 MEV，但他们可以「自觉地」承诺将收入投入到生态建设中回馈用户与开发者；\n* 分散排序器或者节点，MEV 利润给到投机者和矿工，就像在 Solana 和以太坊这样的 L1。\n\n而这两者都曾因此出现 gas 飙升、网络拥堵的情况。\n\nStarkNet 的方式是推动排序去中心化运营，开发者可以申请成为排序器运营者，拥有 StarkNet 代币的用户可通过质押代币成为质押者，作为奖励，排序器与质押者可能因为按照共识规则执行排序职能获得奖励，这在一定程度上可以限制无序的 MEV，实现相对公平的交易排序，限制恐怖的 gas 飙升与不必要的网络拥堵。\n\n### 更多收入\n\n长期来看，建立 PoS 机制的 StarkNet 将会取得相比 OPR 项目更高的收入天花板。\n\nArbitrum、Optimism 的协议收入通过 MEVA 获得，最大值取网络上的潜在交易利润之和，利润受到网络上的 DeFi 应用影响。Optimistic Rollup 所发行的代币仅有治理权与 MEV 收入的分红权。\n\nStarkNet 在 PoS 机制下的协议收入，可能由 gas 和质押奖励构成（暂未公布细节）。gas 收入取决于 StarkNet 网络的应用需求——与以太坊类似，PoS 的质押机制使得质押者与排序器可以铸造新的代币。\n\n而且 StarkNet 属于 ZKR，理论上的 TPS 和 gas 优化上限比 OPR 高很多。OPR 的性能优化有限，目前来看只能运营 DeFi 等相对低 TPS、高单位收益的场景，而 StarkNet 上更有可能产生应用创新，促进更多应用类别的爆发。加上 StarkNet 上的 gas 由 StarkNet 代币支付，因此可以推理 StarkNet 的收入上限高于 OPR。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/abp9ljlpi3230csc.png!heading)\n\n*来源：Xiang｜W3.Hitchhiker，以上计算前提是以当前 ETH 价格为 2500 U，区块 gaslimit 为 30,000,000，gas 费用为 30 Gwei，平均 13 秒的出块时间计算， 极限 TPS 指对应运行环境占领了所有以太坊区块空间 (在证明验证上花费 500,000 gas)，普通 TPS 指对应运行环境占领了所有以太坊 1/3 的区块空间。*\n\nStarkNet 作为第一个建立 PoS 机制的 L2 项目，打破了长期存在于 L2 Rollup 中的 MEVA 困境。PoS 的共识参与机制能够限制 MEV，降低用户支付成本，提高平台体验，缓解网络拥堵，获得更高的收入上限，其代币经济远比 Optimistc Rollup 类项目良性健康，长期来看将会使得 StarkNet 在 L2 的竞争中获得更大的优势。StarkNet 的代币计划将是 L2 发展史上的重要节点。\n\n## 六、StarkNet 挑战以太坊\n\nStarkNet 的 PoS 创新使得 StarkNet 不仅领先于其他 OPR 项目，还将会挑战以太坊的地位。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/j65t9cf1hxyiazg7.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://ethereum.org/en/)*\n\n### 网络结算\n\nStarkNet 代币与 ETH 将会争夺 gas 的结算价值。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/v2fbb13htjcurxmo.jpg!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://foresightnews.pro/article/detail/barnabe.substack.com)*\n\n尽管 StarkNet 作为以太坊的 L2 需要用 ETH 支付将汇总信息发布在以太坊主网上的打包与发布费。但 StarkNet 网络上的 gas 由 StarkNet 代币支付，这会分流以太坊上的 gas 收入。\n\n一方面，随着 StarkNet 上 TPS 与 gas 不断优化，StarkNet 将会涌现出丰富的生态应用，催生大量的 gas 用量。另一方面，以太坊主网项目不断移植到 StarkNet 以及其他更高 TPS、更低 gas 的 L2 网络上，这会减少以太坊 gas 以及 ETH 代币的使用。此消彼长，StarkNet 代币相比 ETH 获得更多 gas 结算价值。\n\n### 流量截取\n\n开发者和用户可以只与 L2 交互，不与 L1 交互。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/e4qhxxt12gyvwm7h.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/)*\n\n因为包括 StarkNet 在内的 L2 是 L1 的扩容解决方案，它具有一个单独的执行层并运行在 L1 上，而该执行层继承了 L1 网络的安全保证。用户将不再需要与以太坊主网交互，因为它将仅作为 L2 的数据可用性层。StarkNet 上的 gas 由 StarkNet 代币结算佐证了这一点，当用户使用 StarkNet 上的程序并支付 gas 时没有任何一个环节直接与以太坊主网有关，StarkNet 成了「网络前台」，截取了用户流量（尽管以太坊作为 L1 在背后默默工作）。\n\n## 结语\n\nStarkNet 发币不仅是发币，还是首个创新地应用了 PoS 机制的 L2，在短期内，这不仅将改变 L2 竞争格局，还将在不远的将来接过以太坊的大棒，推动加密网络朝着去中心化、安全、可扩展的方向继续前进。", "timestamp": 1658284778, "digest": "5SayU7tApajgyNwr0WoSZGIQJfl30x8ennBteYzCAZI", "contributor":

引言\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/58003f42a2bde8acd4bd3c007d6951c6.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/the-roadmap-to-serenity-2/)*\n\n转眼 2022 年已走过一半。我们回看 Vitalik 在 2018 年 Devcon 演讲中提出的 Serenity Roadmap，容易发现以太坊的发展路径几经更迭 — 对比当前的路线图，分片被赋予新的含义，eWASM 亦少有人提及。\n\n为了避免潜在的欺诈和用户误导问题，今年 1 月底，以太坊基金会宣布弃用「ETH2」的说法，而是把当前的以太坊主网改称为处理交易和执行的「执行层」，把原 ETH2 的说法改称为协调和处理 PoS 的「共识层」。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/b64f31cd005d0e753d9a3a0132d07527.png)\n\n当前，以太坊官方的路线图涵盖了三部分内容：信标链、合并与分片。\n\n其中，信标链（Beacon Chain）作为以太坊向 PoS 迁移的前置工作，以及共识层的协调网络，于 2020 年 12 月 1 日启用，迄今已运行近 20 个月。\n\n合并（The Merge）指当前以太坊主网与信标链的最终合并，也即执行层与共识层的统一，标志着以太坊正式迁移到 PoS。在 IOSG 的文章「黎明将至：以太坊合并近在咫尺」中，我们介绍了合并相关的重要进展：当前以太坊 Ropsten 与 Sepolia 测试网成功完成了合并，紧接着是 Goerli 的合并；如果一切顺利，意味着我们离主网合并不远了。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/b42cd77884f6103d15eac69e8ca72c85.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://medium.com/decipher-media/blockchain-scaling-solutions-4-1-ethereum-sharding-e88e8cacdfc)*\n\n本文我们将着重讨论分片（Sharding）。原因在于：\n\n* 其一，假定主网合并能够在年内顺利实现，那么分片将紧随其后，作为 2023 年以太坊的开发主轴。\n* 其二，以太坊分片的概念最早由 Vitalik 在 2015 年的 Devcon 1 中提出，此后 GitHub 的 Sharding FAQ 中提出了分片的 6 个发展阶段（如上图）。然而，随着以太坊路线图的更新和相关 EIP 的推动，分片的含义和优先级都产生了很大变化。当我们在讨论分片时，需要先确保对其含义的理解达成一致。\n\n综上两点，梳理清楚分片的来龙去脉是很重要的。本文将着重讨论以太坊原分片、 Danksharding 和 Proto-Danksharding 的由来、进展和未来路线，而非具体到每个技术细节。关于 Danksharding 和 Proto-Danksharding 的详细内容，可参考 IOSG 此前的文章：[「扩容杀手锏 Danksharding

Rollup、数据可用性和分片。\n\n我们在这里快速回看一遍三者的基本概念。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/15f8bede43d93dd444c742368644c47b.png)\n\n当前主流 Rollup 分为 zkRollup 和 Optimistic Rollup。前者基于有效性证明，即批量执行交易，依赖密码学证明 SNARK 来保证状态转换的正确性；后者「乐观地」假设所有状态转换是正确的，除非被证伪；即需要一段时间窗口来确保错误的状态转换能够被发现。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/9cdf01723d7af24a11410c9a75165321.png)\n\n数据可用性对 zkRollup 和 Optimistic Rollup 都非常重要。对前者而言，用户可以基于数据可用性重建二层的所有交易，以确保抗审查；对后者而言，需要使二层的所有数据都被发布，没有被隐藏任一交易。至于当前数据可用性面临的瓶颈与相应的解决方案，在下文中会提到。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/b9b2c3816883d2c8a35df67141271610.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://www.web3.university/article/ethereum-sharding-an-introduction-to-blockchain-sharding)*\n\n以太坊全节点对 EVM 的完整状态进行存储，并参与所有交易验证，这样确保了去中心化和安全性，但随之而来的是可扩展性的问题：交易线性执行，且需要每个节点进行逐一确认，这样无疑是低效的。\n\n此外，随着时间推移，以太坊网络数据不断积累（当前达 786GB），运行全节点的硬件要求随之水涨船高。全节点数量下降将引发潜在的单点故障，并削弱去中心化的程度。\n\n直观地看，分片相当于分工合作，即对所有节点进行分组，每笔交易只需要由单组节点进行验证，并定期向主链提交交易记录，以此实现交易的并行处理（比如有 1000 个节点，原来每笔交易都必须由每个节点进行验证；如果把他们分为 10 组，每组 100 个节点来验证交易，效率显然大大提升了）。采用分片使得在提高可扩展性的同时，也降低了单组节点的硬件要求，从而解决上述两个问题。\n\n## 原分片\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/07e7281156759df22f9a24aa20300c25.jpeg)\n\n*图片[来源](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html)*\n\n以太坊原方案中有 64 个分片，每个分片中都有独立的提议者和委员会，提议者是被随机选择的一个验证者，收集交易并进行排序；委员会是一组验证者的集合（至少由 128 个验证者组成），每隔一定时间被随机分配到各个分片上，并验证交易的有效性，如果委员会的 2/3 投票通过，则调用验证者管理合约（VMC）向信标链提交交易记录。区别于下述的「数据分片」，这种分片也被称为「执行分片」。\n\n## 背景\n\n在聊 Danksharding 之前我们不妨先花点时间了解其背景。个人猜想，Danksharding 推出的社区氛围基础主要来自 Vitalik 的两篇文章。这两篇文章为以太坊的未来发展方向定下了基调。\n\n首先，Vitalik 于 2020 年 10 月发表了「以 Rollup 为中心的以太坊路线图」，提出以太坊需要在中短期内对 Rollup 进行集中支持。其一，以太坊基础层扩容将聚焦于扩大区块的数据容量，而非提高链上计算或 IO 操作的效率。即：以太坊分片旨在为数据 blob（而非交易）提供更多空间，以太坊无需对这些数据进行解释，只确保数据可用。其二，以太坊的基础设施进行调整以支持 Rollup（如 ENS 的 L2 支持、钱包的 L2 集成和跨 L2 资产转移）。长远来看，以太坊的未来应该作为安全性高的、人人可处理的单一执行分片，以及可扩展的数据可用性层。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/9a11857d30b2d0953cf0bcdd2780f6fd.jpeg)\n\n*图片[来源](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html)*\n\n此后，Vitalik 在 2021 年 12 月发表的「Endgame」中描述了以太坊的最终图景：区块产出是中心化的，但区块验证实现去信任且高度去中心化，同时确保抗审查。底层链为区块的数据可用性提供保证，而 Rollup 为区块的有效性提供保证（在 zkRollup 中，通过 SNARK 来实现；在 Optimistic Rollup 中，只需有一个诚实参与者运行欺诈证明节点）。类似于 Cosmos 的多链生态，以太坊的未来将是多 Rollup 共存的——它们都基于以太坊提供的数据可用性和共享安全性。用户依赖桥在不同 Rollup 之间活动，而无需支付主链的高额费用。\n\n上述两篇文章基本确定了以太坊的发展方向：优化以太坊的基础层建设，为 Rollup 服务。以上论点也许基于这样一个看法：既然 Rollup 已经被验证有效并且得到良好的采用，那么「与其将花上几年时间等待一个不确定且复杂的扩容方案（注：指原分片），不如将注意力放在基于 Rollup 的方案上」。\n\n在此之后，Dankrad 提出了新分片方案 Danksharding。以下我们把 Danksharding 的具体技术组成拆分出来理解。\n\n## Proto-Danksharding\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/93f4475b17349506f031ec2cf05a76c1.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://l2fees.info/)*\n\nProto-Danksharding 提出的背景在于，虽然 Rollup 方案对比以太坊主链而言显著降低了交易费用，但还没有到足够低的理想程度。这是由于以太坊主链上提供数据可用性的 CALLDATA 仍然占据较大的花费(16gas / byte)。在原先的设想中，以太坊提出在数据分片中提供每个区块 16MB 的专用数据空间给 Rollup 使用，但距离数据分片的真正实施仍旧遥遥无期。\n\n今年 2 月 25 日，Vitalik 和 DankRad 等提出了 EIP-4844（Shard Blob Transactions）提案，也即 Proto-Danksharding，旨在以简单、前向兼容的方式扩展以太坊的数据可用性，使其在 Danksharding 推出之后仍然可用。该提案的改动仅发生在共识层上，不需要执行层的客户端、用户和 Rollup 开发者进行额外的适配工作。\n\nProto-Danksharding 实际上并未执行分片，而是为将来的分片引入了一种称为「Blob-carrying Transactions」的交易格式。这种交易格式区别于普通交易在于其额外携带了称为 blob 的数据块（约为 125kB），使区块实际上变大，从而提供比 CALLDATA（约为 10kB）更加廉价的数据可用性。\n\n然而，「大区块」的普遍问题是对磁盘空间的要求不断累加，采用 Proto-Danksharding 将使以太坊每年额外增加 2.5TB 的存储量（当前全网络数据仅为 986GB）。因此，Proto-Danksharding 设置了一段时间窗口（例如 30 天），在此之后对 blob 做删除操作，用户或者协议可以在这段时间内对 blob 数据进行备份。\n\n即，以太坊的共识层仅仅作为一个高度安全的「实时公告板」，确保这些数据在足够长的时间里是可用的，并使其他用户或协议有足够的时间来备份数据，而非由以太坊永久保留所有的 blob 历史数据。\n\n这么做的原因是，对存储来说，每年新增的 2.5TB 不在话下，但对以太坊节点却带来不小的负担。至于可能导致的信任假设问题，实际上只需有一个数据存储方是诚实的（1 of N)，系统就可以正常运作，而不需要实时参与验证、执行共识的验证者节点集（N/2 of N）来存储这部分历史数据。\n\n那么，有没有激励来推动第三方对这些数据进行存储呢？笔者暂时没有发现激励方案的推出，但 Vitalik 本人提出了几个可能的数据存储方：\n\n1. 针对应用的协议（例如 Rollup）。它们可以要求节点存储与应用相关的历史数据，如果历史数据丢失，会对这部分应用造成风险，因此它们有动力去做存储；\n2. BitTorrent；\n3. 以太坊的 Portal Network，这是一个提供对协议的轻量级访问的平台；\n4. 区块链浏览器、API 提供者或者其他数据服务商；\n5. 个人爱好者或者从事数据分析的学者；\n6. The Graph 等第三方索引协议。\n\n### Danksharding 数据可用性采样（DAS）\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/fd6eae4e9be18bd96d1d1a1d4bf7b624.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://notes.ethereum.org/@hww/workshop_feb_2022)*\n\n在 Proto-Danksharding 中我们提到新的交易格式使得区块实际上变大了，并且 Rollup 也累积了大量数据，节点需要下载这些数据来保证数据可用性。\n\nDAS 的想法是：如果可以把数据分为 N 个块，每个节点随机地下载其中的 K 个块，就能验证所有数据是否可用，而无需下载所有数据，这样就能大大减少节点的负担。但如果某个数据块丢失了怎么办？仅仅通过随机下载 K 个块很难发现某个块丢失了。\n\n为了实现 DAS，引入了纠删码（Erasure Coding）技术。纠删码是一种编码容错技术，基本原理是把数据分段，加入一定的校验并使各个数据段之间产生关联，即使某些数据段丢失，仍然能通过算法将完整的数据计算出来。\n\n如果把纠删码的冗余比例设置为 50%，那么意味着只需要有 50% 的区块数据可用，网络中的任何人就可以重建所有区块数据，并且进行广播。如果攻击者想要欺骗节点，则必须隐藏掉超过 50% 的区块，但只要进行多次随机采样，这种情况几乎不会发生。（例如，假设对区块进行了 30 次随机采样，这些区块都恰好被攻击者隐藏掉的几率是 2^(-30) ）……\n\n既然节点不下载所有数据，而是依靠纠删码来重建数据，那么首先需要确保纠删码被正确编码，否则用错误编码的纠删码当然没法重建数据。\n\n这样，进一步引入了 KZG 多项式承诺（KZG Polynomial Commitments），多项式承诺是一个「代表」多项式的简化形式，用于证明多项式在特定位置的值与指定的数值一致，而无需包含该多项式的所有数据。Danksharding 中通过采用 KZG 承诺来实现对纠删码的验证。\n\n如果我们可以把所有数据都放在一个 KZG 承诺中当然很省事，但是构建这个 KZG 承诺，或者一旦有部分数据不可用，重建这个数据——两者的资源要求都是巨大的。（实际上，单个区块的数据需要多个 KZG 承诺来保证）而同样为了降低节点负担从而避免中心化，Danksharding 中把 KZG 承诺进行了进一步的拆分，提出了二维 KZG 承诺框架。\n\n当我们依次解决上述问题之后，依靠 DAS，节点或者轻客户端只需要随机下载 K 个数据块，就能够验证所有数据是可用的；这样一来，即便引入「大区块」之后，也不会过多地加重节点的负担。\n\n*（注：特别地，Danksharding 中采用的纠删码算法是 Reed-Solomon 编码；KZG 承诺是由 Kate、Zaverucha 和 Goldberg 发表的多项式承诺方案。在此暂不做展开，对算法原理感兴趣的读者可自行拓展。此外，确保纠删码正确性的方案还有在 Celestia 中采用的欺诈证明）*\n\n### 区块提议者与构建者分离（PBS）\n\n在当前情况下，PoW 矿工和 PoS 验证者既是区块构建者（Builder），又是区块提议者（Proposer）——在 PoS 中，验证者可以用 MEV 的利润获取更多新的验证者席位，从而有更多机会去实现 MEV；此外，大型验证池显然比普通验证人有更强大的 MEV 捕获能力，这样导致了严重的中心化问题。于是，PBS 提出把 Builder 和 Proposer 进行分离。\n\nPBS 的想法如下：Builder 们构建一个排好序的交易列表，并且把出价提交给 Proposer。Proposer 只需要接受出价最高的交易列表，且任何人在拍卖的获胜者被选出之前，无法知道交易列表的具体内容。\n\n这种分离和拍卖的机制引入了博弈和 Builder 之间的「内卷」：毕竟每个 Builder 捕获 MEV 的能力不尽相同，Builder 需要权衡潜在的 MEV 利润、以及拍卖出价之间的关系，这样实际上减少了 MEV 的净收入；而无论最终 Builder 提交的区块是否能够顺利产出，都需要向 Proposer 支付竞价的费用。这样一来，Proposer（广义上是所有验证者集，一定时间内随机重选）相当于分享了一部分 MEV 的收入，削弱了 MEV 的中心化程度。\n\n以上介绍了 PBS 在解决 MEV 方面的优势，而引入 PBS 还有另一个原因。在 Danksharding 中，对 Builder 的要求是：在 1 秒左右计算出 32MB 数据的 KZG 证明，这需要 32-64 核的 CPU；并且在一定时间内以 P2P 的方式广播 64MB 的数据，这需要 2.5Gbit/s 的带宽。显然验证者无法满足这样的要求。\n\n于是 PBS 把两者分开，Proposer 仍然作为一般验证者节点，负责选择交易列表，并广播区块头；而 Builder 作为一个专门的角色，负责上述工作和构建交易列表。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/33e7e78772d19c79cad8cc37648535c0.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980)*\n\n去年 10 月，Vitalik 提出了双 Slot PBS 方案（注：每个 Slot 为 12 秒，是信标链的时间单位），但具体的 PBS 方案仍然在讨论中。\n\n### 抗审查列表（crList）\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/92ae8f830ff42b52075e0f5927ca5762.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://notes.ethereum.org/@hww/workshop_feb_2022)*\n\n但 PBS 也带来一个问题，如果某个 Builder 总是出最高价（甚至宁愿承担经济损失）来赢得拍卖，那么他实际上有了审查交易的能力，可以选择性地不把某些交易包含在区块中。\n\n为此，Danksharding 进一步引入了抗审查列表 crList（即 Censorship Resistance List），即 Proposer 有权利指定一个交易列表，这个交易列表必须被 Builder 所包含；在赢得拍卖后，Builder 需要证明 crList 中的交易都已经被包含在内（或区块已满），否则该区块将被视为无效。\n\n### 小结\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/989bb7d9533650b0402e3e6a590eb567.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://notes.ethereum.org/@hww/workshop_feb_2022)*\n\n把上述的数据可用性采样（DAS）、区块构建者和提议者分离（PBS）以及抗审查列表（crList）组合起来，就得到了完整的 Danksharding。我们发现，「分片」的概念其实已经被淡化了，尽管保留了 Sharding 的叫法，但实际上的重点已经放在对数据可用性的支持上。\n\n那么 Danksharding 对比原分片有哪些优势呢？\n\n*（Dankrad 本人在这里列举了 Danksharding 的 10 个优点，我们选取两个来具体解释）*\n\n在原分片中，每个单独的分片都有其提议者和委员会，分别对分片内的交易验证进行投票，并由信标链的提议者收集所有投票结果，这项工作很难在单个 Slot 内完成。而在 Danksharding 中只在信标链上存在委员会（广义的验证者集，一定时间内随机重选），由这个委员会来验证信标链区块和分片数据。这相当于把原来的 64 组提议者和委员会简化为 1 组，无论是理论还是工程实现的复杂度都大大降低了。\n\nDanksharding 的另一个优点是，以太坊主链和 zkRollup 之间有可能实现同步调用。上文我们谈到，在原分片中信标链需要收集所有分片的投票结果，这会产生确认的延迟。而在 Danksharding 中，信标链的区块和分片数据由信标链的委员会进行统一认证，也即同个信标区块的交易可以即时访问分片的数据。这样激发了更多可组合性的想象空间：例如 StarkWare 提出的分布式 AMM（dAMM），能够跨 L1/L2 进行 Swap 或共享流动性，从而解决流动性碎片化的问题。\n\n在 Danksharding 得到实施之后，以太坊将变成 Rollup 的统一结算层和数据可用性层。\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/51c50da550820e4adf3a5ec9f60ad582.png)\n\n在上图中，我们对 Danksharding 进行一个总结。\n\n综上，我们大致可以看到，未来的 2 至 3 年内，以太坊路线图的指向性是非常明显的——围绕服务 Rollup 而展开。尽管在此过程中路线图改动与否仍然是未知数：Danksharding 预计将在未来 18-24 个月内实现，而 Proto-Danksharding 将在 6-9 个月内实现。但至少我们明确了 Rollup 作为以太坊的扩容基础，占据着一定的主导地位。\n\n根据 Vitalik 提出的展望，在此我们也提出一些预测性思考和猜想：\n\n* 一是类似 Cosmos 的多链生态，未来以太坊上将出现多 Rollup 的竞争格局，由以太坊为它们提供安全性和数据可用性的保证。\n* 二是跨 L1/Rollup 基础设施将成为刚需。跨域 MEV 将带来更加复杂的套利组合，类似上述提到的 dAMM 带来更丰富的可组合性。\n* 三是多 Rollup 的生态应用将超越以太坊本身。由于以太坊的定位退居其次，作为 Rollup 的数据可用性层，我们猜测更多的应用会迁移到 Rollup 上面去做（若第二点成立）；或者至少在以太坊和 Rollup 上面同时做应用。\n\n> **参考材料：**\n\n> https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/the-roadmap-to-serenity-2/\n\n>

MetaMelange\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/metamelange-7meh4>\n\nMetaMelange 是 NFT 合成协议。协议使用了 inceptionV3 图片分析模型，通过 Tensorflow 进行本地渲染从而将一个主物件和一个背景板融合并生成新的图像。用户可以对生存的图像进行融合程度的调整并一键 mint 成一个新的 NFT。\n\n可自由组合的 NFT 一直被认为是 NFT 未来发展之一。NFT 的可组合性是它主要价值所在，它带来的强大个性化定制能力是 metaverse 所需要的基础组件之一。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/549hVy8Gm5Dq5i46HMz8B.png?height=1141&width=1600)\n\n### 3. ZK KYC SBT\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/zk-kyc-sbt-ozwb2>\n\nZK KYC SBT 是一个链上钱包 KYC 的基建项目。用户 KYC 时会使用 Worldcoin 生成一个具有隐私性（ZK）的身份证明，此身份证明在绑定到用户所拥有的钱包地址后，可成为用于钱包 KYC 认证的灵魂绑定代币。\n\n链上钱包 KYC 验证一度被视为一个难题，零知识证明很好地解决了用户身份核对问题。\n但 Worldcoin 的主要目的不是验证 KYC，而是验证在某个单次使用场景中的单个真人的唯一性。因此，整个 KYC 的信息证明可以使用更符合 KYC 证明需求的零知识证明模块来解决。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/53wxnGYQnENU6D1BYxjIY.png?height=879&width=1600)\n\n### 4. Frens: mobile app to keep your connections\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/frens-mobile-app-to-keep-your-connections-x24r2>\n\nFrens 是一个 IRL (In Real Life，实地) 关系网络。只有当两人线下见面时，他们才能通过 Frens 互相发送一个关系证明代币。整个系统由 Worldcoin 提供真人验证，通过定位来确定两个人之间的距离，通过 WalletConnect 提供用户钱包服务。\n\n相对于网络约会，线下见面是一个更容易建立互相信任的过程。双方面对面交换留下的证明是对个人实际关系网的认证。相比于 Linkedin 的一键 Connect，Frens 依据实地证明形成的朋友圈显然更具说服力。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KzQH_L3FpJynYnDQ46soj.png?height=1600&width=740)\n\n## 5. SubKey\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/subkey-4vxfk>\n\nSubKey 是钱包权限管理的应用。用户使用 SubKey 建立一个特定的钱包权限（如 Transfer）并对此权限进行分享。\n\n举例来说，用户可将在某个 DeFi 平台的清算权限交给一个清算工具/平台，让其代管理进行更合理的清算。或者，用户可把流动性挖矿资金交给专业机构/工具进行平衡，从而减少无偿损失并获得更高的流动性挖矿收益。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V1g1hVtzGPoVn1_7qoYLC.png?height=986&width=1600)\n\n### 6. eth/place\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/eth-place-kwpve>\n\neth/palce 复刻了 Reddit 上最经典的社区艺术项目 r/place （大家自由在一个画板上以像素为单位进行上色）并加入了 NFT 和租借功能。通过 SuperFluid 的 NFT 租借功能，用户可以自由租借一个代表像素上色权的 NFT，并自由设定像素的颜色。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/37fc53mm2GsT7ylsuU3Ti.png?height=985&width=1600)\n\n### 7. Pozitions\n\n**链接**：<https://ethglobal.com/showcase/pozitions-c53qd>\n\nPozitions 是一个基于 Synthetix 期货仓位的流动性服务。通过将 Synthetix 的期货仓位 mint 成 NFT，用户不需要平仓再开仓，可以直接交易仓位。仓位的直接交易能避免交易双方因资金再次借贷而产生额外资金费用，这也能避免税务上与收益相关的一些额外计算。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2SqkZOYT2Rz3sSJ9cmj1f.png?height=1600&width=1085)\n\n### 8. LiquiFlow\n\n**链接**：<https://ethglobal.com/showcase/liquiflow-sunj8>\n\n杠杆和定投（Direct Cost Averaging） 对一些 web3 交易者并不陌生，但带杠杆定投的操作方式则相对比较陌生。LiquiFlow 使用 SuperFluid 的流式资金流构建了：使用 AAVE 开杠杆，使用 Uniswap 买入的杠杆定投功能。\n\n这种投资方式通过杠杆加高了短期波动的同时又以定投对冲长期风险。在特定条件下，盈利效率会比单纯的杠杆仓位或定投高出很多。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/npUuSWz2wlOdznQo4lJeY.png?height=576&width=1056)\n\n### 9. Dyve\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/dyve-rdhug>\n\n目前 NFT 金融还处于一个早期发展阶段。虽已有数个 NFT 抵押借贷平台，但对于 NFT 这个百亿市场来说，显然还有更多的发展空间。\n\nDyve 由此诞生，是一个 NFT 做空平台。\n\n用户比起单纯地长期持有 NFT（多头），可以通过将 NFT 以一定额的超额抵押和过期期限来出借给做空者以获得额外的收益。\n\n但做空者无需归还同一个 NFT，只需要归还同一系列中的任意一个NFT或者放弃抵押品就能结束一个做空周期。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QevtnQYV5M8LV_ZBboi7i.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n### 10. Granted\n\n**链接**：<https://ethglobal.com/showcase/granted-vtxne>\n\nGranted 是一个项目资助管理平台。作为一个资助者，Granted 使用 Unlock 协议来管理资助者的资助资金管理，项目方或团队也可以申请拨款资金。申请者的信息会通过 EPNS 的信息推送服务推送给资助者，而资助者设定的里程碑则会由其选定的团队来完成。\n\n资助资金将会根据设定的里程碑规则发放，如月活用户分别达到一千、一万、十万将会分别获得三分之一的总拨款。除了资助者对于项目实际进度的审查以外，所有行为都在链上进行，从而能让整个资助过程公开透明且去中心化并具有更高的公平性。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8pedEHTwBOa_aWyBnirUY.png?height=783&width=1280)\n\n### 11. sDao\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/sdao-sorition-based-dao-gjcbr>\n\n最近的热议话题之一，是对 DAO 中心化的担忧。sDao 给出了他们的解答：抽签式民主（Sortition）。抽签式民主是指从想参与投票的所有人中选取一部人并给予实际投票权来决定一件事情。\n\n对于 DAO 来说，DAO 可以设置准入门槛，在所有达成准入门槛并申请的人中选出一定百分比的人来进行公平投票。这种投票方式的缺点也很明显：其可能会被女巫攻击，即一个人拥有多个账号。\n\n这种治理模式也变相扼杀了看好项目且有治理需求的巨鲸的大量资金的涌入（除非通过女巫攻击），从而让 DAO 的治理代币失去大量需求。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eR_Xd7xWEq38_RJVP0u4Q.png?height=1600&width=1508)\n\n### 12. [Eth.id](http://Eth.id)\n\n**链接**：<https://ethglobal.com/showcase/eth-id-heoay>\n\nEthid 是一个中心化的 ENS 扩展项目，通过注册 aaa./eth./id 的子域名，用户就拥有了一个可自定义的社交身份信息界面。用户使用 .xyz, .io, .net等域名，很多时候是由于 .com 域名的高昂的购买/使用费用。Ethid是ENS域名的扩展，并能提供用户信息界面。\n\n目前项目主体部署在中心化的 AWS 上。但对于这类可放弃动态存储的项目，部署到 IPFS 再使用 ENS 作为网页入口会更加符合 web3 的去中心化精神。从用户体验上来说，两者唯一的不同是用户每次修改信息都需上传 IPFS + 设置新 IPFS 链接到 ENS （并支付 gas）。但这两个步骤可在后台进行，并由用户单次确认设置 ENS 时支付的 gas ，从而带来可接受的流畅体验。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dYKy2lrqeq3mC2YNo9xM1.png?height=1600&width=920)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658284947, "digest": "EuH1wtNIlv3E_XOkY3MXEr2TApYqZUYkRUbqUmSRtJw", "contributor": "0x70562F91075eea0f87728733b4bbe00F7e779788"}

The abundant sunshine makes the sea bluer, and the seaside is quite lush. They are aquatic plants that grow along the coast.\n\nThere is a water plant that he doesn't want to be in a group, and he always looks out to the sea alone and thinks. Imagine what's on the other side of the sea.\n\nIn the evening, he listened to the singing of the waves, hoping that the wind would blow his mind away and drift away into the distance. Suddenly, another song interrupted his fantasy.\n\n\"La la la la... la la...\" A small fish swam here with bubbles and humming a song.\n\nXiaoyu found him, stopped, and asked him, \"Shui Cao, why are you looking at the sea alone?\"\n\nHe smiled and said, \"Little fish, I was thinking about what the other side of the sea would look like.\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qbNGgWVldv2JASyVKVuX6.png?height=270&width=397)\n\n\"Oh.\" Xiaoyu spit out a bubble, \"Maybe it's still the sea, because the sea is very big.\"\n\n\"Little fish, I believe that there must be another scene on the other side of the sea.\" Waterweed said with infinite fascination.\n\nXiaoyu said: \"Then when I grow up, I'll come and have a look.\"\n\nThe waves are dancing happily again.\n\nA spring has passed, and the little fish has only grown a little. However, she fell in love with water plants.\n\nEvery afternoon, small fish dare to swim from the bottom of the sea to the surface. Swim to the side of the grass. Because of the harsh sun in the morning, the little fish was too small for his body to bear. But every now and then, she would slip up in disobedience at noon, spit at the water plants, and talk intimately for a while. It was not until the sun scalded the fish that she reluctantly swam back to the bottom of the sea.\n\nTheir love is helpless, the water grass can't give the little fish a hug, because he is not a water grass in the sea; the little fish can't give the water grass a kiss, because she is not a bird on the shore.\n\nShe could only look at him and smile and smile at him. Sing to him and pop a bubble. They talked about the other side of the sea together. The water plant said that there must be a lot of small fish there, and the small fish said that there must be countless water plants there.\n\nOne day, the grandfather of the big fish said to the little fish: \"Your love has no results, you are not a water plant, and he is not a small fish.\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ecqNK3sDyS9nQ80sBurZV.png?height=266&width=474)\n\nXiaoyu wagged his tail vigorously, \"I don't care! I don't care!\"\n\nGrandpa Dayu sighed and continued: \"I can use magic to restore your memory to eight seconds, you only love him for eight seconds.\"\n\nXiaoyu shouted: \"No! Even if I become a fishbone, I will still love him, remember him!\" Xiaoyu turned and swam away.\n\nShe swam to the side of the water plants, she did not speak. She was crying all the time. She knew that water plants could not see.\n\n\"Silly little fish, why are you crying?\" Shui Cao asked distressedly.\n\nXiaoyu was surprised, \"How did you know?\"\n\nWaterweed smiled proudly, \"Fool, I stretched my roots into the sea and felt your tears. It's so warm.\"\n\nThe little fish burst into tears.\n\nWith the arrival of summer day by day, the sea water is getting hotter and hotter by the sun. Small fish are getting weaker and weaker due to frequent exposure to ultraviolet rays and immersion in warm seawater. The scales are also falling off.\n\nThe journey from the bottom of the sea to the surface of the sea is getting longer and longer, and the small fish are struggling more and more. Missing makes her crazy, she can't see him for a day. The summer sun makes the water plants grow taller and greener. Xiaoyu's eyes were full of green that fascinated her.\n\nXiaoyu heard that the parents of the aquatic plants wanted him to marry another aquatic plant in early autumn. She was crying hard on the bottom of the sea, and the fish passing by didn't even know she was crying. In this world, only water plants can feel the temperature of her crying. Xiaoyu burst out crying, and she cried all the water in her body.\n\nAt night, the little fish swam to the surface. Staring at the water plants madly. Both are speechless. They both understand the pain in each other's hearts. Only knowing is not annoying: \"I know, I know...\"\n\nAfter the little fish left, the mood of the water plants was difficult to calm down for a long time. He couldn't forget Xiaoyu's desperate eyes and broken scales. He made a big decision: he wanted to find a way to pull out the roots, plunge into the sea, and be with the little fish. Whether doing so is life or death.\n\nThe next day, the sun was particularly strong. The aquatic plants had to crawl on the wetlands to avoid sunburning themselves. He wants to tell Xiaoyu his decision at night.\n\nAt dusk, the water plants straighten their bodies. Not far away, he seemed to see a small fish, motionless there.\n\nWave after wave of sea water patted the little fish ashore and stopped beside the aquatic plants.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CoR8Qej4ah9tFqJQRK6sF.png?height=266&width=439)\n\nIs it a small fish? ! Oh, no. It's the corpse of a small fish.

Web3.0 定义为后端生产关系的创新，其缘起于对 Web2.0 超级平台模式生态不平衡的变革。然而，随着互联网变成各行各业的基础设施，我们可以预见 Web3.0 未来不会是仅仅对于某一个特定行业的改变和替代，而是为各行各业发展提出「生态共荣」成长模型的解决方案，其核心特征包括开放（代码开源，降低技术门槛；进入身份无门槛，嫁接全社会优质资源）、共荣（基于 Token 经济学实现生态各个参与方利益一致）、核心环节自治（基于区块链不可篡改的信任机制，让组织进步更加可持续）。长期看，我们认为更自由、利益分配更合理的生产关系有望推动新一轮自下而上的科技创新。\n\nDAO 是生态共荣模型的核心载体。相比于历史上类似的合作组织、开源软件开发等类似的组织形式，Web3.0 提出一套新的解决方案，就是去中心化自治组织（简称 DAO），又可以被称为基于某种协作目的的社区。DAO 的整体生态目前可分为 DAO 底层基础设施、应用类 DAO，基础设施为 DAO 建设的辅助工具，未来破圈还需仰仗应用类 DAO 的发展。DAO 目前处于初级发展阶段，根据 DeepDAO 数据显示，总拥有的资产总额今年 6 月达 85 亿美元，呈现良好发展态势，活跃参与社区治理的人数为 67.8 万人，超过 100 人持有治理代币的 DAO 组织为 629 个。\n\n从 Uniswap DAO 的案例看社区共荣模型发展路径。任何生态型的产品（包含开发者、C 端用户、创作者、投资者等环节）最终都可以以 DAO 的形式进入生态共荣模型，但是好的产品仍然是生态共荣模型的根基。我们将社区 DAO 的发展分为三个阶段：1.初期以打造产品为主，这时 DAO 与传统公司形态无异，需要创始团队前瞻决策，比如 Uniswap 初期重点打造基于 AMMs 的去中心化交易所产品；2.逐步培养社区，可以开始建立 Token 激励体系，吸引一部分社区重要成员参与治理；3.Exit to Community，将社区核心治理权通过 Token 归还给生态，创始团队可能仍是中心级的存在，但没有绝对掌控权，比如 Uniswap 将其代币 UNI 大部分发行给了社区，并通过 UNI 激励社区成员参与治理。\n\nDAO 目前问题和风险。DAO 目前仍处于早期阶段，面临诸多问题，例如在全球大多数地方仍未获得监管认可，运营存在法律风险；核心决策机制不完善，具体又可分为体系内风险（如少数人合谋，多数欺负少数）和体系外风险（比如贿赂选票等），风险潜在解决方案包括改变驱动的治理形式、投票方法或规则来解决。我们建议用开放心态看待 DAO 的发展，在发展中解决问题，或许是 DAO 未来正确发展之路。\n\n### 风险\n\nDAO 组织形式不受监管法律认可风险；决策机制不完善导致运行失败风险；代码漏洞、体制机制不健全导致金库被攻击风险。\n\n### Web3.0 缘起是建立更公平、平等的生产关系\n\nWeb3.0 是基于区块链技术，具有去中心化和 Token 经济激励体系的新型生产关系，是下一代互联网迭代方向。在元宇宙世界中，革新同时发生在前端与后端。与 AR/VR 等前端创新不同，Web3.0 更加聚焦后端生产关系的更新，随着区块链、加密货币、去中心化应用、DeFi 等生态逐步成熟，Web3.0 迅速崛起。2022 年 3 月，美国总统拜登签署了行政令\\[1\\]，在对 Web3.0 进行审慎监管同时强调美国必须引领 Web3.0 趋势发展，也侧面说明行业趋势和重要性。\n\nWeb3.0 必要性缘起于对 Web2.0 生产关系革命。在对 Web3.0 必要性的讨论中，比较经典理论来自 a16z 投资人 Chris Dixon\\[2\\]：他认为 Web2.0 平台的发展遵循 S 型增长曲线，而 Web2.0 的不平衡来源于，Web2.0 超级平台和与上下游的关系（含上游内容生产者、下游用户等）会随着其发展规模的变化而变化——在超级平台成长初期，总的蛋糕在不断变大，平台和上下游生存空间也一起变大。但随着时间推移，当超级平台用户增长停滞的时候，随着其对于利润持续追逐，超级平台自然就会挤压上下游利润，「正和博弈」变为「零和博弈」。这就导致，上游端，创作者对利益分配不均的状况不满；下游端，用户数据隐私等各项权益无法保障。因此，缘起于 Web2.0 超级平台主导生态必然的不平衡性，我们需要一个新的范式，这就是 Web3.0——基于区块链的，去中心化和代币经济激励的新的生产关系。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658283025410.png)\n\n*图表：互联网超级平台的发展规律*\n\n*资料来源：Chris Dixon《Why Decentralization Matters》(2018)，中金公司研究部*\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658283031746.png)\n\n*图表：从 Web1.0 到 Web3.0 的发展过程*\n\n*资料来源：Shermin Voshmgir《Token Economy: How the Web3.0 reinvents the Internet》(2020)，中金公司研究部*\n\n以这样的思维模式理解 Web3.0 生产关系的必要性是没有问题的，因为这是一种更兼顾公平和平等的生产关系。然而，我们都知道投资的核心是追求技术创新带来的效率提升。那么，Web3.0 的生产关系效率提升点在哪里？把用户数据所有权归还给用户是否必然造成系统整体效率的降低？我们认为，从效率提升维度来看，Web3.0 核心承载点在于生态共荣模型（Ownership Economy）。\n\n### 生态共荣模型助力 Web3.0 高速、高质量发展\n\n如果说 Web2.0 使得互联网本身壮大成为了一个重要行业，随着互联网越来越成为社会发展的基础设施，Web3.0 引领将不是单一行业创新——其预示着互联网将渗透进各行各业，且 Web3.0 新的生产关系或将成为长期互联网全新社会「元宇宙」发展的底层生产关系。也就是说，从 Web3.0 的革命性来讲，Web3.0 虽然缘起于想改变超级平台中心化的生产关系，但其背后思考远景更大，其意在基于区块链技术，建立一种新型社会协作模式和利益分配机制，我们将其定义为「生态共荣模型」，而这种社区型生态共荣模型特点有开放生态、共荣、核心环节自治。\n\n* 开放生态：任何人都可以给生态发展做贡献，Web3.0 采用底层代码开源等形式，不存在数据垄断，同时嫁接最广泛的社会资源（包括人才流动，无时间和空间的束缚）。\n* 共荣：Token 经济学、博弈理论等体系是生态共荣模型的必要条件。例如，社区生态每个参与者（包括开发团队、投资者、创作者、用户等）都是生态内 Token 的持有者，这些参与者具有一致的共同利益，能够共同推动生态发展。\n* 核心环节自治：基于智能合约等形式，DAO 的组织形态可以实现核心管理和利益分配环节自治，避免人为操作导致的寻租空间和利益冲突等问题，从而提升去中心化治理的可操作性。\n\n生态共荣模型驱动比特币生态发展。在比特币的生态中，比特币（其本质就是维系生态的核心纽带——Token）让开发者、使用者和投资者形成利益一致的共同体，并共同为比特币生态的前进而努力（每个人都可以成为比特币的营销者），而其背后的激励制度（例如挖矿奖励比特币）则吸引大量矿工成为生态支持者。由此，生态共荣模型是比特币能在过去 10 年中迅速崛起的核心原因之一。假设比特币由任何一家中心化公司发行，可能很难达到如此高度。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282982354.png)\n\n*图表：比特币的生态共荣模型*\n\n*资料来源：Packy McCormick《The Dao of DAOs》(2021)，中金公司研究部*\n\n### 生态共荣模型是对传统公司制度的民主化\n\n类比过去 300 年国家政体民主化进程，以 DAO 为载体的生态共荣模型可以视为新的民主化公司制度。国家制度从封建主义发展到资本主义，再从资本主义发展到社会主义，政体民主化程度进一步提高。类比来看，生态共荣模型在「公司控制生态，股东最终控制公司」基础上进行了更加民主化的革新，最终，「生态参与者共同决定生态未来走向，分享生态发展红利」将成为生态共荣模型的长期目标。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282956817.png)\n\n*图表：公司制度发展历程*\n\n*资料来源：中金公司研究部*\n\n长期来看，更开放的环境；利益更一致、更平衡的体系；更公开透明的分配制度有希望催生更广泛的技术创新。历史上看，当工人被赋予更多自由，更好的激励，一个新的自下而上创新的环境被创造出来，从而驱动更多技术创新驱动工厂效率持续提升。Netflix 的 CEO Reed Hastings 就曾经提出一个基于人才密度，取消管控，催生自由创意的独特管理模型\\[3\\]，也是 Netflix 持续创新的基础管理体系。长期来看，我们认为 Web3.0 的生态共荣模型底层逻辑也是类似的，其更开放环境，利益一致的体系和更公开透明制度有望引领下一波科技创新浪潮，从而引领 Web3.0 生态效率进一步提升。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282932814.png)\n\n*图表：Reed Hastings 提出的 Netflix 独特管理模型*\n\n*资料来源：Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer《No Rules Rules》(2020)，中金公司研究部*\n\n## 生态共荣模型的历史沿革：开放合作，相得益彰\n\n### 第一种形态：合作组织模式\n\n合作组织是指成员为了达到某种社会、经济、文化目的而自愿形成的自制组织，所有权归大家共有。根据国际合作社联盟（ICA）的数据显示，截至 2020 年，全球有 12% 的人口加入过合作组织，全球最大的 300 个合作组织资金周转规模达到 2.1 万亿美元，全球合作组织提供就业机会达到 2.8 亿美元。\n\n最有名的合作组织是之一 Visa。Visa 最初来自 1958 年美国银行推出的具有循环信用功能的贷记卡 BankAmericard。从 1966 年开始，Visa 在信用卡业务出具规模后，为了应对当年成立的竞争对手 MasterCharge（即万事达卡的前身），开始授权加州以外的银行发卡经营；此后还授权给加拿大、日本、英国、法国等家的银行。再往后业务规模进一步扩大，Visa 与美国国内授权的银行成立 NBI 组织，海外被授权的银行则成立了 IBANCO 组织。1976 年 NBI 和 IBANCO 合并成为 Visa 国际组织。\n\nVISA 国际组织是世界上最大的信用卡国际合作组织之一，是一个由全世界银行参与的、非盈利的国际性组织，由会员单位共同拥有，会员由银行等金融机构组成，共同建立起一个全球的支付和金融服务的网络。虽然 2008 年 Visa 在 IPO 以后，决策权落至独立的董事会，但不可否认，截至 2022 年 7 月 15 日，Visa 的市值超过 3900 亿美元，曾经的合作组织模式是具备一定功劳的，能够最大化使得不同主体更高效协作，从而创造更大价值。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282904358.png)\n\n*图表：Visa 组织发展历程*\n\n*资料来源：36 氪，新浪财经，腾讯财经，Visa 公司公告，中金公司研究部*\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282898786.png)\n\n*图表：Visa 创造了过去十几年金融业市值增长之最*\n\n*资料来源：Wind，中金公司研究部*\n\n然而合作组织在发展过程中也存在诸多问题：启动成本、竞争态势、治理体系等。\\[4\\]\n\n* 冷启动困难：合作组织初始期比较难启动，俗话说「三个和尚没水喝」，「大锅饭」模式很难激发大家创始的积极性。相反，传统中心化组织由于一开始就有明确的目的（比如募资以实现收益最大化），反而更容易达成目标。\n* 不一定竞争得过效率更高的传统公司：如果碰到激烈的行情竞争，在合作组织的资金资源、效率都不占优势的情况下，传统中心化公司若真使用铁腕手段与之竞争，合作组织很难形成合力与之抗衡。\n* 治理体系设计难：合作组织的治理体系比较难设计，如何高效、专业达成决策结果是难点，之前的许多合作组织最终都延续了传统公司的层级治理结构。\n\n### 第二种形态：开源软件生态\n\nWeb3.0 的底层基础设施的核心特征之一就是代码开源属性，我们认为其与传统开源软件生态的发展也有一定类似性。从 1990 年以来，PC 操作系统由闭源的 Windows 统领，然而，基于开源协作体系的 Linux 在过去 20 年中不断发展，并在 Android 操作系统（基于 Linux）开始占据移动互联网市占率首位后（占比超 40%），证明了开源软件生态体系的成功。\n\nLinux 是一套开放源代码程序的、可以自由传播的类 Unix 操作系统软件，诞生于 1991 年 10 月 5 日，由芬兰学生 Linus Torvalds 和后来陆续加入的众多爱好者共同开发完成。开发 Linux 系统的目的就是建立不受任何商业化软件版权制约的、全世界都能自由使用的类 Unix 操作系统兼容产品。在过去的 20 年里，Linux 系统主要被应用于服务器端、嵌入式开发和 PC 桌面 3 大领域，其中服务器领域是重中之重。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282832334.png)\n\n*图表：全球操作系统市占率（%）*\n\n*资料来源：statcounter，中金公司研究部*\n\n开源软件生态能够胜出的原因：软件开发天然具有流程化特点，适合多人按一定流程协作，而开源体系则能够嫁接全社会最优质的资源，以供养这套流程化操作。正如 a16z 合伙人 Chris Dixon 所说\\[5\\]：「闭源软件推出时一般相对完善，但其进步速度和其雇佣员工资源相关；而开源软件推出时经常像个半成品，但是随着时间发展，其能够最广泛利用社会优质资源从而获得指数级别增长。」\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282812792.png)\n\n*图表：开源生态图*\n\n*资料来源：CSDN，中金公司研究部*\n\n另一个类似开源软件模式的典型案例是维基百科（Wikipedia）。最初的互联网的崛起并不是在消费端进行效率提升，而是在生产端进行效率提升——满足了用户追求言论表达自由的需求。维基百科的前身是 Nupedia，这是一个 Web 版的在线百科全书计划，其邀请众多不同领域专家成为编辑，但是速度很慢，一年才发表不到 24 个词条。而 Wikipedia（2001 年推出）则采用类似 Linux 的开源编辑模式，任何人都可以在前人的基础上编辑。这样的协作模式在最初可能被认为是没有质量的，然而事实上在互联网上先放出一个错误答案很容易得到他人的修改进而得到正确答案。Wikipedia 成立一个月后就产生了 600 个词条，数量多而且质量高，1 年后词条到 2 万个，两年达到 10 万个。2003 年，创始人 Wales 把 Wikipedia 设立成为非营利组织（Not for profit），到目前为止维基百科主要的商业模式为用户捐赠。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282789069.png)\n\n*图表：维基百科发展时间线*\n\n*资料来源：Medium，中金公司研究部*\n\nLinux 和 Wikipedia 成功证明了两点：1.相比于封闭的公司，民间拥有更多真正优秀的工程师；2. 开源模式也可以产生高效的协作。人们对开源模式一直存在误解，认为其很容易被破坏，因为每个人都可以编辑。但是从另一个方面想，开源模式使得每个人都可以修改内容（内容上的错误不会永久存在），并且开放、协作的模式使得不存在单一的权威可以对内容施加控制。这也许可以视为 Web3.0 时代里 DAO 这种去中心化组织的理论雏形之一。\n\n然而，开源软件生态最大问题是经济激励不足。开源社区、开源基金会等组织均须要将传统商业公司的捐赠作为主要的收入来源，而传统商业公司的捐赠并不是无条件的，他们更多想依赖开源社区成功孵化商业产品。而对于开源社区内部开发者，开源组织内部并没有一套成型的激励机制，目前不求回报式的无条件贡献内容还是开发者在开源组织内发布内容最常见的形式。相比来看，Web3.0 的生态则利用加密货币体系解决了经济激励不足的问题。\n\n## 生态共荣模型核心组织载体——DAO\n\n### Web3.0 提出全新的组织解决方案——DAO\n\n合作组织和开源生态作为生态共荣模型的早期产物，二者存在一定的优缺点。二者的优点在于能够尽可能使得参与方利益一致，并最大化嫁接全社会优质资源。但缺点也很明显：主要在于缺乏激励机制，难以形成合力，同时治理体系也较难设计。\n\nWeb3.0 则基于区块链技术以及目前已经建立相对成熟的去中心化金融体系（DeFi），提出一种兼具合作组织和开源生态的优点，并改善其缺点的解决方案——DAO。一方面，Web3.0 底层开发、开源属性能够嫁接全社会最优质的资源，能够从价值观角度使得参与生态的用户形成一致（不一致就可以分叉）的共识；另一方面，基于 Token 的经济体系，Web3.0 能够使得开发团队、用户和投资者等各方利益达成一致，且从博弈理论角度来看，社区本身欣欣向荣的发展是大家都盼望的事情（虽然不可调和的分歧可以通过分叉解决，但必定损伤每一位生态所有者的经济利益）。\n\n### 什么是 DAO？\n\n顾名思义，DAO 是 Decentralized Autonomous Organization 的简称，意为「去中心化自治组织」，核心意思有三层，也就是这三个词语各自代表的意思。\n\n* Decentralized（去中心化）：按照以太坊创始人 Vitalik 的定义，去中心化意味着没有一个实体可以控制所有组织内部所有的操作流程。但是再往下深究，去中心化并不完全是无中心化。由此，Web3.0 所言的去中心化是相对 Web2.0 而言的，并不是绝对的去中心化。如果将去中心化分成建筑、组织和逻辑三个维度来看，区块链以及 DAO 所说的去中心化很可能是建筑上（打破地理位置限制）、组织（权力分布）上的去中心化，而不是逻辑上去中心化（DAO 不能自由切换成两个同样的整体仍然良好运转）。\\[6\\]\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282727150.png)\n\n*图表：不同组织形态的区别*\n\n*资料来源：Vitalik Buterin 《The Meaning of Decentralization》(2017)，中金公司研究部*\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282721274.png)\n\n*图表：DAO 的去中心化是建筑、组织上的去中心化*\n\n*资料来源：Vitalik Buterin 《The Meaning of Decentralization》(2017)，中金公司研究部*\n\n* Autonomous 自治：DAO 的自治指执行和部分管理环节都利用智能合约负责，从而较少出现执行环节的权力寻租空间。Vitalik 曾经说过\\[7\\]，传统自动化是替代基层工人的流程化工作，而 DAO 自治也要替代传统公司的管理层机制（例如分配利益环节程序自治）。总而言之，DAO 的目的之一是尽量减少在决策和执行过程中的人为操作空间，以程序为基础获取大多数人的信任，从而提升组织运行的效率。\n* Organization 组织：其核心是解决协作的问题，这是 DAO 的基础属性。与 Web3.0 理念一脉相承的是，DAO 的组织内涵包括开放自由、利益平等等。\n\nDAO 又可以被称作是以某种特定协作目的，基于共识机制聚合而成的社区。DAO 是一种基于区块链技术的新的治理社区，是一种助力项目融资和分享利益的组织形式。相对传统公司组织形式，DAO 有去中心化、高度自治和组织协作的特点。\\[8\\]\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282677242.png)\n\n*图表：DAO 与传统公司形态的对比*\n\n*资料来源：Linda Xie《A beginner’s guide to DAOs》(2021)，中金公司研究部*\n\n我们可以从规模效应、网络效应、竞争能力、替换成本四个角度对比来看 DAO 的优缺点。\n\n* 规模效应：一般。DAO 能够最广泛使用全球优质人才和资源因此能够迅速做大规模。此外，其基于智能合约自治环节也使得公司运行本身成本较低（规模越大，IT 成本更低）。但整体而言，其规模效应相比传统公司并无绝对明显优势。\n* 网络效应：优秀。DAO 利用 Token 激励将开发者、创作者、用户和投资者等各方利益统一，基于博弈理论，使生态内部每一个人都有最大动力去提升 DAO 的价值，加速 DAO 的成长。此外，随着 DAO 所在生态的成熟，又会吸引更多用户、创作者、投资者、开发者等，从而形成更快飞轮循环。\n* 竞争能力：优秀。DAO 的分配机制更加公平平等，各方利益一致（且分配不会随着规模变化而变化），因此其一旦形成网络效应更加难以被改变。\n* 替换成本：一般。DAO 的代码底层都是开源的，任何不满意的社区生态用户都可以选择复制一个现有社区，替换成本不高。因此，DAO 的网络效应和竞争能力核心来自于真正满足了用户的需求，而不是来自数据或者代码的垄断。当然，持有人对于 Token 经济价值是吸引其停留在原有社区重要原有之一。\n\n#### DAO 的治理框架：目前协调和决策方式\n\n根据火币研究院的划分，DAO 的治理框架主要集中于「如何协调」以及「如何决策」两个核心步骤。针对「如何协调」的问题，可粗略地分为链上提案治理和链下提案治理，而我们知道 DAO 目前的核心决策方式是投票，那么「如何决策」的问题则重点解决采用何种投票机制。\n\n链上提案治理是 DAO 治理中最基本的环节，采用智能合约实现去中心化的治理流程，将治理机制写入代码，通常会通过代币持有者投票来决策。而链下提案治理则是一种辅助手段，通常采用在链下进行非正式的社区讨论，避免过多占用链上资源。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282631392.png)\n\n*图表：DAO 治理的核心问题*\n\n*资料来源：火币研究院《DAO 哪里了：简析 DAO 的发展历程及治理机制》（2021），PAKA Labs，Polkadot，中金公司研究部*\n\nDAO 的投票机制中最为简单的就是一通证代表一票（1T1V），但这个投票机制本身有不少缺陷，需要长期持续迭代。我们知道，追根溯源，传统意义上一个去中心化社区要通过治理方案理论上需要>50% 的 Token 持有份额者通过。然而这就导致几个问题：不是所有方案参与者都有兴趣参加（尤其是持有份额较低的人）、参与投票的人经验不足（乌合之众多而有能力者没有发言权）、提案在 Token 投票机制中没有轻重缓急之分、投票效率低等。因此针对这些问题出现了一些新的投票机制解决方案，流动民主、知识可提取投票有抬高具备专业知识专家投票决策地位的方案；信念投票、加权投票则对于投票者本身有重要程度的划分。整体来看，Web3.0 并不能逃避现实民主社会决策机制中各种问题，其反而是现实社会某种映射，因此对于如何保证决策流程公平公正、效率、专业等问题将是长期讨论和迭代的方向。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282603945.png)\n\n*图表：常见的 DAO 投票机制\\[9\\]*\n\n*资料来源：PAKA Labs，中金公司研究部*\n\n### DAO 市场概况和格局：工具铺路，应用兴起\n\nDAO 目前处于初级发展阶段。根据 DeepDAO 的数据显示，从资产规模来看，DAO 所拥有的资产总额从 2021 年 7 月一直处于增长状态，但近期有所波动和下滑，2022 年 6 月达 85 亿美元，资产管理规模超过 100 万美元的 DAO 组织仅有 98 个（统计基数为 2228 个 DAO）。从用户数来看，DeepDAO 所统计的 DAO 组织中，持有治理代币的人数为 370 万，活跃参与社区治理的人数为 67.8 万人，超过 100 人持有治理代币的 DAO 组织为 629 个。因此不管从资产规模还是用户数来看，DAO 组织形态目前还是以小体量团体为主。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282482269.png)\n\n*图表：DAO

工具属于辅助 DAO 运行的基础设施，是 DAO 能够兴起的必要条件，其能够帮助 DAO 解决创立、投票、争端解决、资产管理、人才招募等问题。此外，未来真正实现破圈的应该是具有不同职能的应用类 DAO，从而变革传统公司组织形式，打造更高效的协作方式。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282411175.png)\n\n*图表：DAO 整体生态格局*\n\n*资料来源：Coopahtroopa，中金公司研究部*\n\n* DAO 的基础设施：含 DAO 的底层操作系统及工具，底层操作系统为创建 DAO 社区提供不同的模板、框架和工具，通常提供智能合约和接口以促进去中心化社区的链上操作，使 DAO 的创建变得更加便捷，典型案例如 Aragon、MolochDAO 等。此外，目前有许多类似于工具箱的细分产品以支持 DAO 的运作，基本围绕社区的治理和代币系统等问题，如 Gnosis Safe（管理社区资产的钱包）、Snapshot（链下投票治理平台）、Discourse（链下论坛）、Tally（治理 dashboard，用于跟踪不同协议的链上投票历史）等。\n* 应用类 DAO：根据 DAO 组织不同的协作目的和职能，可以分成捐赠类 DAO、投资类 DAO、协议类 DAO、服务类 DAO、社交类 DAO、收藏类 DAO、媒体类 DAO 等。这些不同类型的应用 DAO 组织使得整个 DAO 生态变得愈发繁荣，实际上 DAO 是个组织框架，这个框架可以套用在任何领域的应用上，核心特征和目的就是去中心化。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282376246.png)\n\n*图表：应用类 DAO 组织实例*\n\n*资料来源：Coopahtroopa，中金公司研究部*\n\n## 从 Uniswap DAO 的案例看社区共荣模型发展路径\n\n生态共荣模型在网络效应和可持续性方面都有明显优势，但在如何驱动创业者完成冷启动角度仍然存在一定短板，比如早期公司面临很多重要得选择需要高效决策，且产品定位等都需要创始团队前瞻定位，因此我们认为社区生态模型并非适合初创企业。根据 Jesse Walden 的《Progressive Decentralization: A Playbook for Building Crypto Applications》文章所言，从初创企业到进入真正生态共荣模型，需要分三步走，分别是产品搭建、建设社区、Exit to community。\\[10\\]本章我们将去中心化交易生态 Uniswap 发展作为案例解析社区共荣模型的发展路径。\n\n### 产品搭建阶段——传统公司模型\n\n初创企业缘起和传统创业公司制度完全一样，创始团队需要聚焦建设一个优秀的产品。好的产品是社区生态的前提，Web3.0 的大前提是软件开源，所谓「前人栽树，后人乘凉」，写代码的过程可以类比乐高积木，初创企业可以很快搞定技术基础搭建的问题，聚焦产品功能开发，如 Compound 就参考了 MakerDAO（包括智能合约、Token 发行、CDP 工具等）来构建自己的基础设施。这个阶段，去中心化不是项目要追求的核心目标，核心目标应是产品本身，公司也会像传统初创企业一样依赖 VC 进行融资着力打造产品（早期的项目也需要专业的投资者）。\n\n以去中心化交易所 Uniswap 为例，其成立于 2018 年 11 月，创立者是 Hayden Adams，最早创立的 Uniswap 是公司形态，且 2020 年获得了 VC a16z 的 2.2 亿美元融资。然而，从产品形式来看，Uniswap 拥有与传统中心化交易所如 Coinbase 截然不同的产品理念：相对于 Coinbase 等中心化交易所，Uniswap 的产品理念融入了更多 Web3.0 去中心化的理念。Uniswap 基于以太坊平台打造，并且基于 AMMs 的流动性池方案形成交易，任何人都可以成为 Uniswap 的流动性提供者。此外，Uniswap 在交易中收取的交易费用（最开始为 0.3%），这笔费用最后会全部奖励给 AMM 体系内的流动性提供者，而 Coinbase 的交易费用则归为公司营收，利润则作为股东回报的根基。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282336880.png)\n\n*图表：Coinbase 和 Uniswap 对比*\n\n*资料来源：Coinbase，Uniswap，FINTECH RUMINATIONS，中金公司研究部*\n\n### 建设社区——DAO 的前身\n\n当产品相对成熟后，产品开发者就可以考虑利用经济激励设计和 Token 经济体系打造社区生态。思考的路径核心是两点：费率和 Token 分配体系。一方面，项目可以考虑从费率等维度考虑激励创作者、用户等各方面参与程度（比如提升创作者分成、降低参与用户费率），但是存在一定的权衡——「提升创作者分成与降低参与用户费率」二者无法兼得（因此 Uniswap 就定在 0.3% 以实现相对合理的平衡）。另一方面，可以考虑逐步向一部分社区核心用户发放 Token 方式鼓励他们参与社区治理，分享社区收益。这时候创始团队仍然对产品方向保持控制能力，但逐步通过公开透明的方式向社区让渡治理的权力，并不断测试、寻找更好的平衡和实现机制。\n\n这里就不得不提及 Uniswap 的分叉案例 Sushiswap，Sushiswap 可以看作是「建设社区」阶段的典型案例，目前在去中心化交易所市场份额占比第五。Sushiswap 产生的背景是，Uniswap 交易量在快速上涨，但却迟迟没有推出自己的 Token 体系。这就导致了几个问题：1. 对核心的流动性提供用户挽留力度不足，用户可以直接拿钱走人，无法体现长期价值；2. 对早期承受了更高风险的流动性提供用户没有给予相应的利益，随着盘子增大，他们的利益会被进一步稀释。\n\nSushiswap 发现了机会，2020 年 8 月复制了 Uniswap 核心代码（Web3.0 开源属性降低了代码开发的门槛）的 Sushiswap 推出，发行了自己的 Token SUSHI，并宣布在 0.3% 交易费率中，将 0.25% 分给流动性提供者，剩下 0.05% 兑换成 SUSHI 分给所有的 SUSHI 持有者。因此 Sushiswap 引入 Token 激励机制用来促进社区生态的发展，意味着即使用户没有提供流动性也可以因为持有 SUSHI 份额而获得激励，实际上是一荣俱荣——这提高了用户对社区本身的依存度。但是，Sushiswap 到这一步还不算是真正意义上的 DAO，因为当时其 Token 只分享了经济利益，没有分享治理权力，现在用户则可以通过持有 SUSHIPOWAH（可以用 SUSHI 兑换）来投票。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282298493.png)\n\n*图表：近一年内 A 类去中心化交易所（DEX）交易量份额*\n\n*资料来源：Nomics，中金公司研究部；注：数据截至 2022 年 7 月 11 日*\n\n早期 Binance 发展也有类似结构。Binance 在 2017 年 ICO 发行 1500 万美元 BNB Token，并宣布 Token 持有人可以在交易费率上打折，且 Token 持有人可以使用 Token 在交易所获得更多曝光（比如曝光自己要 ICO 的项目），同时 Binance 会定期销毁 BNB 来控制供给量来防止通胀。虽然 BNB 没有治理权，但是这种形式让社区在经济利益上达成一致，是建设社区共荣模型的重要一步。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282282142.png)\n\n*图表：近一年内 A 类中心化交易所（CEX）交易量份额*\n\n*资料来源：Nomics，中金公司研究部；注：数据截至 2022 年 7 月 11 日*\n\n### Exit to community——社区共荣模型形成\n\n随着产品成熟、社区生态成型，最后一步就是 Exit to community，其重要的一步是将 Token 发行、销毁等激励体系、社区治理体系写进智能合约，让社区实现真正的核心自治，而核心决策权则回归 DAO。当然，初始团队仍然在社区拥有很大的影响力，比如以太坊的创始人 Vitalik，在关键时刻仍将不得不做出重要的决定，带领社区前行（比如 2016 年以太坊 The DAO 的硬分叉），但是社区底层的治理权已经回归 DAO，社区共荣模型建成。\n\n在 Sushiswap 以及其他 swap 项目都开始发行 Token 后，Uniswap 也做出了自己的动作。2020 年 9 月，Uniswap 宣布发行 UNI，共十亿枚，并正式转型为 DAO。根据 UNI 的分配方案，最初的四年中，大部分（60%）的 UNI 归属于社区，团队则获得 21.51% 的 UNI。但为了尽量避免有些用户使用消极策略持有 UNI 的情况（不做诸如社区治理、提供流动性等贡献，仅持有 UNI，相当于躺着赚钱），Uniswap 在四年后将对 UNI 开启永续通胀率，每年通胀 2%，这样一来这些消极的用户为了使手里的 UNI 不贬值，会有动力去做对社区有价值的事情。\n\n同时，在 UNI 的分配方案中，充分考虑了早期用户的利益。2020 年 9 月的 UNI 分配方案中，曾经的流动性提供者、用户和 SOCKS 持有者（Uniswap 发布的一种 NFT 袜子，可兑换实物），可以立即认领 UNI 的 15%；每个曾经调用过 Uniswap v1 或 v2 合约的地址都可以申请 400 UNI（相当于空投）；SOCKS 持有者可领 1000UNI。剩下的 43% 的 UNI 供应将存在社区的「社区金库」中，通过贡献者捐赠、社区提案、流动性挖矿和其他计划持续分配。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282238806.png)\n\n*图表：最初四年 UNI 的分配份额*\n\n*资料来源：Uniswap，中金公司研究部*\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282233622.png)\n\n*图表：10 年通胀后 UNI

的治理环节的决策流程可以分为三步：热度确认、共识确认、提案治理。每个环节所需参与投票的 UNI 总数不同：热度确认和共识确认是链下治理，属于链上治理前的准备工作，用来确认提案是否具有上链的价值，否则浪费链上资源，提案治理才是真正的链上决策。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282179181.png)\n\n*图表：Uniswap 治理流程*\n\n*资料来源：Uniswap，中金公司研究部*\n\n### Exit to community 或将对传统 IPO 形成替代效应\n\n传统 IPO 资本化体系背后的认知是：投资者相信的是方法论，就是用一套科学方法论去估值，但这种方式更强调专业框架体系，却往往忽视了产品本身内在价值；而 Web3.0 应用资本化 Exit to community 提供一种新的视角：即相信社区成员才真正懂这个产品内容价值，投资者也应该成为社区一部分（通过加密货币投资)。长期来看，其或对传统的 IPO 市场造成一定替代效应。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282145092.png)\n\n*图表：Exit to community（社区共荣）或将对传统 IPO 形成替代效应*\n\n*资料来源：Nathan Schneider《Startups Need a New Option: Exit to Community》(2019)，中金公司研究部*\n\n## 问题和风险：决策机制仍然有待完善\n\n### DAO 目前在世界大多数地方仍然不受法律保障\n\nDAO 目前法律实体还处于灰色地带。目前 DAO 是否具有法律实体的正当性还没得到政府监管的完全确认。有别于传统公司形态，没有一个人能像传统的 CEO 或高管团队那样对 DAO 行使控制权，诸如 DAO 应如何报税、纳税或签署具有法律约束力的合同等问题一直存在疑问。传统公司的注册机制实际上是在法律上界定了「让人们了解是在与谁打交道」，这是传统概念中经济活动的重要基础之一，但是 DAO 目前无法界定这一点。这种在法律实体上的不确定性其实也增加了 DAO 本身运作的不确定性。\n\n美国怀俄明州政策「松绑」。2021 年 7 月 1 日美国怀俄明州投票通过关于允许 DAO 在该州正式注册的法案\\[11\\]，旨在允许 DAO 被州政府特许和认可，可以注册成为一种独特形式的 LLCs，且有限责任公司可转型为 DAO。2021 年 7 月 4 日，去中心化自治组织 CryptoFed DAO 被怀俄明州国务卿办公室认定为美国第一个合法 DAO。从目的来看，怀俄明州的这个法案可以视为 DAO 希望与法律机构建立正式关系，并在更稳固的基础上与监管互动。从监管的角度看，怀俄明州其实是从用户保护角度出发的，DAO 被视为 LLC 实则是一种保护，如果没有这种保护，DAO 也可以被视为普通合伙企业，那么一旦发生风险，成员对 DAO 的任何义务或行为都要承担连带责任（这点类似从无限责任公司到有限责任公司发展）。\n\n### DAO 决策流程目前仍有缺陷\n\n以太坊创始人 Vitalik 曾经说过：「虽然区块链和加密货币最开始的愿景是利用基数逃离现实中治理机制缺陷，但实际上却活生生复制了这些缺陷。加密货币不过是现实社会一个更大范围的映射。」也就是说在现实社会民主施行机制的难题，在 DAO 领域其实仍有许多问题需要解决，其中又主要可以分为两大类型风险：即体系内风险（体制、机制不健全等），以及体系外风险（行贿、收买选票等风险）。\n\n#### 体系内风险：体系本身的问题\n\n目前 DAO 的核心决策机制仍然是基于治理代币持有权为核心基础，然而这套机制本身会带来一些问题：少数人合谋、多数欺负少数、利益冲突。\n\n* 少数人合谋（「巨鲸问题」）：目前 DAO 的核心决策机制仍然是以治理代币持有权为核心基础，其明面上是去中心化的，但背后可能被少数「富有的」持币人把控。在 Token 体系中，大量的小份额代币持有者似乎没有足够动力去参加投票，例如，历史上，以太坊 The DAO 社区治理提案参与率从未超过 10%。\n* 多数欺负少数：代币投票治理以牺牲社区其他部分的利益（少数）为代价，赋予大多数代币持有者利益。一个具备协议的社区往往由不同价值观、愿景和目标的成员组成，这些成员中也包含不持有代币的人。然而，显然投票只赋予了代币持有者权力，而这些人一般会以代币价值增长为目标。\n* 利益冲突：如果富有的代币持有者还同时持有其他平台的代币，那么会暴露利益冲突。\n\n针对体系内风险的解决方案：针对少数人合谋的问题，小份额的用户可以采用委托代理投票的形式，把他们手里的投票权委托给自己信任的社区成员（类似代议制选举议员）。比如有些 DAO 采用流动民主机制，社区成员有权利委托受信任的成员，同时也可以随时撤回委托，流动性比代议制要强。这种方案同时也可减轻「利益冲突」的问题，因为流动民主不再完全是投票权与 Token 完全绑定的状态。\n\n#### 体系外风险：被攻击风险\n\n更难处理的是，DAO 可能存在被组织操纵选举的风险，即贿赂投票人。贿赂风险出发点在于被贿赂人的利益权衡，虽然贿赂选票会带来对社区本身的伤害，但是如果贿赂者给予被贿赂人的利益大于被贿赂者修改选票对社区治理的影响大小，那么被贿赂者确实有动力接受贿赂。因此这种情况一般发生在持币额较小的代币持有者身上，在他们看来，反正他们的话语权「微不足道」，接受贿赂对社区也没什么伤害。\n\n* 第一种贿赂方案：典型案例为包装合约，吸收用户的 XYZ 代币（包装合约用 WXYZ 换），并承诺给予他们股利，包装合约则向外通过拍卖吸收到的 XYZ 代币治理权赚取收益，以支付股利。\n* 第二种贿赂方案：将用户持有 Token 享有的利润分享权与治理权分开，典型案例为 DeFi 借贷平台。借款人拥有没有经济利益的治理权，贷款人没有治理权的经济利益，因此借款人容易被操纵。\n* Dark DAO：DAO 本身也可以用来攻击 DAO——一种去中心化的组织，可以不透明地在链上买票，具体的操作为利用受信任的硬件与 DAO 结合，允许用户自己证明他们正在运行投票购买者的「恶意钱包」的代码 / 程序以换取付款（这个过程是完全隐私的，外界看不到）。当达到投票购买者的预设阈值之后（比如 Token 数额），程序会根据投票买家的命令自动对某个提案进行投票，并向投票买家发送收据，投票买家再对投票用户付款即可。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658281435181.png)\n\n*图表：Dark DAO 运行流程（受信任的硬件以英特尔 SGX 为例）*\n\n*资料来源：Philip Daian, Tyler Kell, Ian Miers and Ari Juels《On-Chain Vote Buying and the Rise of Dark DAOs》(2018)，中金公司研究部*\n\n#### 体系外风险的解决方案\n\n以太坊创始人 Vitalik 就以上问题给出了三种潜在解决方案（具体解决方案也可以是多种方案的组合），主要围绕代币治理的问题。\\[12\\]\n\n* 施行有限的 Token 驱动的治理，对底层基础设施以 off-chain 投票机制为主；比如加时间戳来限制用户在获得 Token 后立刻加入治理环节、提高分叉的容易度等，但是这个办法本身比较消极；\n* 使用非纯 Token 投票驱动的治理形式，比如采用根据社区贡献度、人格证明系统来设计投票权，衍生出诸如二次方投票等形式；\n* 改变投票规则本身，Vitalik 认为代币投票之所以失败，是因为选民不单独对他们所投的决定负责，那么未来可以建立新投票系统——让选民必须对自己投票选择负责（建立负反馈机制，如果你的 Token 是贿赂来投票的，那么你的 Token 将被销毁）。\n\n基础设施的完善可能也能够带来新的解决方案。Vitalik 最近提出了 SBT——灵魂代币的概念，是和用户钱包（账户）绑定的不可转让的代币，任何线上线下的机构或个人都可以给一个钱包发放 SBT，例如用户的毕业学校、工作企业、参加过的公益组织、贷款或参与流动性挖矿的 DeFi 平台、深度参与过的 DAO 组织等。\\[13\\]SBT 有望集成用户单独身份和过往学历、职业等经历进而建立一套自下而上的个人信用评分体系，从而在 DAO 治理中实现甄别不同用户及其专业能力等作用，这将有望从完善基础设施角度上解决体系外风险的问题。\n\n## 总结：DAO 的发展仍然任重而道远\n\nDAO 的发展毫无疑问还处于早期，由于篇幅的关系，我们不太可能一一列举出 DAO 当下发展面临的种种问题和风险，但是就像科技的进步一样，用一种开放心态面对 DAO 的发展，实事求是，在发展中解决问题，或许是 DAO 未来正确发展之路。\n\n>

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第八篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体向上。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一个周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业发展\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658285205, "digest": "oGNbaYmpTOecjwcI5UgXp3z1czi6_x5CciDZlWTBeS8", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

{"id": "LfX7Bs8d7MoEJm2J7aPQnC49J6mvKYSvjJuX-k8LpMk", "title": "What Is Web3?", "body": "# What Is Web3?\n\n`Web3 is a new evolution of the Internet based around the principles of decentralization. Web3 combines the rich and interactive digital experiences that exist today with infrastructure that offers users ownership and cryptographic guarantees.` \n \n\nWeb3 has recently burst into the mainstream consciousness, with industry leaders across the traditional tech sector and blockchain ecosystem weighing in with a wide range of perspectives on the past and future of the Internet. \n  \n Before we dive in, a brief history of the term. \n  \n The term “Web 3.0” was first used during the dotcom era by HTTP pioneer Tim Berners-Lee to describe an integrated communication framework in which Internet data is machine-readable across different applications and systems—a concept he also referred to as the Semantic Web. \n  \n Later, in his 2014 blog post [DApps: What Web 3.0 Looks Like](http://gavwood.com/dappsweb3.html), Ethereum Co-founder Gavin Wood repurposed Berners-Lee’s expression, using it to refer to the ability of blockchain technology to define a “fundamentally different model for the interactions between parties” based on “a zero-trust interaction system.” \n  \n Wood’s writing focused not on cryptocurrencies but on protocols and technologies, such as consensus engines and cryptography, that could facilitate a stronger social contract across the web. He later described the aim of Web3 as “Less trust, more truth.” \n  \n Now, the term is the subject of much debate, with both the tech giants of today and the vanguard of the blockchain industry continuing to reckon with Web3’s core propositions and protocols, and its implications for the trust models of the future. \n  \n In this deep dive, we’ll define Web3 in relation to earlier iterations of the Internet, walk through the key technologies of the Web3 stack, and explore the current and future state of the Web3 landscape. \n  \n ‍**A note on terminology:** We’ll use the term “Web3” as distinct from “Web 3.0”, which is often associated with Berners-Lee’s vision of the Semantic Web. \n \n\n## The Evolution of the Internet: From Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 to Web3\n\nTo truly grasp the meaning of Web3, it’s important to understand the history of the Internet and how Web3 differs from the versions of the web that preceded it. \n \n\n### Web 1.0 (1994-2004)\n\nWeb 1.0 was the first iteration of the Internet we’re familiar with today, emerging in 1994 and ending around 2004 with the rise of social media giants like Twitter and Facebook. While the general public came to learn about the Web 1.0 Internet around 1994, Web 1.0 actually started as a U.S. government program called ARPANET, or Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, in 1968. ARPANET began as a small network of military contractors and university professors who exchanged data with one another. \n \n\n![ARPANET circa 1967. Each node in this diagram was either a computer at a university such as UC Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA, Michigan, Carnegie Mellon, or MIT. (source)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dq8hfK6hVBESyzGBjsWbJ.png?height=945&width=1088)\n\nThe Web 1.0 Internet was mostly a collection of static HTML pages and afforded users limited ability to interact with each other. Although Internet gateways such as America Online (AOL) and discussion forums such as Usenet permitted private chat and discussion boards, for most the Internet remained a space where few interactions or financial transactions took place. \n  \n \n\n![Web 1.0 pizza ordering form. Pizza Hut was an innovative company in the Web 1.0 space because it introduced a website that customers could use to order pizza. Payments, however, had to be made in person. (source)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZwMnxGlhDFI7jl5AXf_NO.png?height=300&width=450)\n\nWhere interactions and financial transactions did take place, they were limited in scope because there was a lack of secure infrastructure for transferring money. One of the most innovative Web 1.0 companies in this respect was Pizza Hut, which in 1995 created an order form for its customers that they could use to place an order and pay in cash once this order was delivered. \n \n\n![Early commercial for America Online (AOL), one of the first Internet gateways. AOL sent CDs with their software and 10 free hours of use to millions of people. (source)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RnQJc-Wmm-KOCBLGsrxUg.png?height=360&width=480)\n\n \n \n\nDespite America Online’s claim in a 1995 commercial that users could order flowers for their mom, buy tickets to a sports game, or write a research report on dinosaurs with AOL, exchanging money online required speaking with an operator since financial transactions were generally unsafe and had limited encryption. \n \n\n### Web 2.0 (2004-The Present)\n\nThe web evolved around 2004 as user demand for social interactions, music, video sharing, and financial transactions grew dramatically due to improved Internet speed, fiber optic infrastructure, and search engine improvements. \n \n\n![The MySpace page of Tom Anderson, co-founder of the early Web 2.0 company. Tom was your first contact when you signed up for a MySpace account. (source)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xI_Jlc5Nq3F6QC7i7LIpp.png?height=630&width=1200)\n\n \n \n\nThis demand for greater interactivity gave rise to many of today’s Internet institutions and companies. Social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter facilitated social interaction; data-sharing applications such as Napster met the demand for online music and video; Google provided an effective means for users to navigate the huge quantity of online information. Traditional institutions such as Bank of America met the demand for financial interactions and electronic fund transfers, enabled by new encryption standards such as 256-bit AES. \n  \n This new, more interactive Internet improved users’ experiences of the web tremendously by adding new functionality. But it also presented a tradeoff that continues to define our online lives to this day: To benefit from these new functionalities and interactions, users have to delegate a large quantity of information and responsibility to siloed third-party platforms, granting these centralized entities a considerable amount of power and influence in terms of data and content ownership. \n  \n This is, for the most part, how the Internet operates up until the present day. In the United States alone, Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon combined [received 23.56 billion visits](https://www.semrush.com/blog/most-visited-websites/) in October 2021—roughly double the traffic of websites ranked 5-20. \n \n\n### Web3 (2008-The Future)\n\nIn 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), which outlined the fundamentals of [blockchain technology](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-a-blockchain-and-how-can-it-impact-the-world/) and a peer-to-peer digital currency, setting a course to change the Web 2.0 paradigm. Bitcoin transformed how we think about digital transactions and provided the first secure means of exchanging money over the Internet that didn’t require a trusted third party. “What is needed,” Satoshi wrote, “is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.” \n  \n It was not until the invention of [smart contracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts) that a decentralized model of the Internet truly came into focus. If Bitcoin enabled secure peer-to-peer payments and smart contracts could expand this idea of programmable agreements to more advanced use cases—insurance, gaming, identity management, supply chains—how would the nature of web experience and digital interaction evolve? By enabling users to directly and securely transact with one another, smart contracts created a fresh vision for an Internet that is fair, transparent, and powered by cryptographic truth. \n  \n Gavin Wood described this reimagined web—Web3—as a “Secure Social Operating System.” \n  \n Put simply, Web3 is a decentralized vision of the Internet that aspires to create an entirely new system of contracts and change the way that individuals and institutions reach agreements. Web3 brings back the decentralized architecture of Web 1.0, the first version of the Internet, which was replete with user-hosted blogs and RSS feeds, and combines it with the rich, interactive experience of Web 2.0 web applications like social media platforms to provide a digital ecosystem where data is user-owned and transactions are backed by cryptographic guarantees. Rather than having to trust brand-based paper promises, users can rely on deterministic software logic to execute agreements exactly as programmed. \n \n\n![Interactions between content consumers and producers Web 1.0, 2.0, and Web3.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t223qh0ZA6x1RD510UPvS.png?height=752&width=1600)\n\n \n \n\n## The Core Elements of Web3: Blockchains, Cryptocurrency, Smart Contracts, and Oracles\n\nPowering the Web3 model is a growing stack of decentralized technologies, such as blockchains, smart contracts, [oracles](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles), crypto wallets, storage networks, and more. Below, we walk through some of the critical layers and componentry of the Web3 technology stack. \n \n\n### Blockchains\n\nA [blockchain](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-a-blockchain-and-how-can-it-impact-the-world/) is a highly secure and decentralized network that allows people to store data, exchange value, and record transaction activity in a shared ledger that is not controlled by any central authority. Blockchain networks serve as the backbone of Web3, providing secure execution environments that allow for the creation, distribution, and trading of cryptocurrencies, as well as the development of programmable smart contracts. Blockchains are the settlement layer of Web3. \n \n\n### Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrencies are digital tokens that leverage the decentralized and tamper-proof environments of blockchain networks to facilitate highly secure transactions. They are the native currencies of Web3 decentralized applications (dApps) and can also be used to pay for Web3 services and participate in Web3 governance. \n  \n Before blockchain technology, tokens were units of value that could be purchased and exchanged to pay for specific products and/or services, such as tokens for highway tolls or amusement park rides and games. In these earlier applications, tokens were useful to service providers because they allowed customers to pay upfront for services that they would consume in the future and because they facilitated transactions where exact change was required. \n  \n Tokens in Web3 applications are also units of value issued to Web3 content creators, but these units of value are digital, programmable, and have functions beyond exchange. In Web3, a token might be held as an investment in a protocol, project, or blockchain. It might have utility for that project or protocol—for paying for a service or insuring a service, for example. It might also provide a gateway to participation in the governance of the protocol or project. \n \n\n### Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (dApps)\n\n[Smart contracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts) are tamper-proof programs on blockchains that facilitate automatic transactions by using conditional software logic such as, “*if x is true, then execute y*.” Programmable smart contracts enable the creation of decentralized applications, or dApps, the cryptoeconomic protocols that bring Web3 to life and put it in the hands of users. \n  \n dApps are different from the applications (apps) that we are familiar with in the Web 2.0 world and the static HTML pages from the Web 1.0 world because they are not maintained by any single individual or organization but rather powered by the decentralized infrastructure of blockchain networks. These seemingly simple, decentralized programs can be used to create complex, automated systems such as [peer-to-peer financial services (DeFi)](https://chain.link/education/defi), [data-driven insurance products](https://chain.link/use-cases/insurance), [play-to-earn online games](https://chain.link/use-cases/nfts-and-blockchain-games), and more. \n \n\n### Oracles\n\nTo realize their full potential, smart contracts need to access and interact with data and systems outside of blockchain networks. [Oracles](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles) are the entities that connect blockchains to real-world data and existing systems, and provide critical infrastructure for establishing a unified, interoperable Web3 ecosystem. \n  \n Chainlink oracle networks not only feed financial market data on-chain to power DeFi applications, but they also provide a wide range of secure off-chain computations such as [verifiable randomness](https://chain.link/chainlink-vrf) and [decentralized execution](https://blog.chain.link/smart-contract-automation/) to enable dynamic NFTs and highly automated dApps. Moreover, with the development of the [Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)](https://blog.chain.link/introducing-the-cross-chain-interoperability-protocol-ccip/), oracle networks will help enable the fast-growing ecosystem of different blockchains and layer-2 scaling solutions to securely communicate with one another. \n  \n Oracles have emerged as an expansive layer of the Web3 stack, providing off-chain data and services to facilitate smart contract innovation, and cross-chain interoperability to help ensure seamless connectivity between different on-chain environments. Chainlink’s oracle infrastructure is also the gateway to Web3 for Web 2.0 backends, serving as an abstraction layer for traditional systems to interact with any private or public blockchain. Ultimately, oracles are the infrastructure that extends the power of decentralized computation and cryptographic guarantees to existing systems, bridging Web 2.0 and Web3. \n \n\n \n \n\n![Web3 is built with decentralized computing networks.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pf2xXNtVs9zPFN7sfzMIq.png?height=1600&width=1529)\n\nThe renewed interest in NFTs has led to a Cambrian explosion of unique applications that leverage the property of non-fungibility in innovative ways, often with the goal of increasing efficiency in the transfer of asset ownership and reducing the need for intermediaries who siphon value away from creators and marketplaces. However, NFTs are still largely in their infancy, meaning there is a vast amount of opportunity for growth from innovative developers, creative artists, and traditional institutions wanting to bring distinct assets on-chain. \n \n\n## Web3 Applications\n\nWeb3 combines decentralization and interactivity to create a new model for the Internet where users can interact directly, without intermediaries. dApps allow users to access permissionless financial tools, trade cryptocurrencies in a peer-to-peer manner, receive parametric insurance payouts, buy and sell verifiably owned digital art through NFTs, play value-generating games, and a whole host of other activities—all without the intervention of a central arbiter. \n  \n With this new structure, the proponents of Web3 hope to create a fairer, more open version of the Internet where parties can interact and transact directly. Currently, Web3 applications that leverage the three foundational technologies—blockchains, smart contracts, and decentralized oracle networks—are already unlocking [use cases](https://blog.chain.link/smart-contract-use-cases/) that are redefining sectors as diverse as [real estate](https://blog.chain.link/blockchain-technology-real-estate/), education, [finance](https://chain.link/education/defi), gaming, and healthcare, and are set to have a transformational impact well beyond these domains. \n \n\nThe technologies that comprise Web3 enable individuals to create and participate in financial protocols that offer unprecedented access, security, and transparency—a new economic landscape that is now widely known as [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://chain.link/education/defi). \n  \n Unlike traditional financial services, DeFi protocols leverage the decentralized infrastructure of blockchains and the secure inputs of oracle networks to help users directly transact with one another in transparent and tamper-proof on-chain markets. [Decentralized money markets](https://blog.chain.link/decentralized-money-markets/) such as Aave—which now secures over $12B in smart contract value using Chainlink oracles—operate in a non-custodial manner and enable users to lend and borrow funds peer-to-peer. Money markets are a key mechanism for supporting a healthy economy. By decentralizing control and leveraging predefined smart contract logic, on-chain money markets help increase economic access, reduce single points of failure, and mitigate system risk and fractional reserve practices.   \n  \n One great DeFi innovation is its [composable architecture](https://blog.chain.link/defis-permissionless-composability-is-supercharging-innovation/), which empowers developers to combine open-source protocols into more sophisticated financial instruments, such as no-loss savings games that use overcollateralized loan protocols, decentralized stablecoins, and interest-bearing tokens that put idle capital to work and unlock liquidity. \n  \n While the novel financial applications offered by DeFi are currently one of the most prominent aspects of Web3, the Web3 model extends far beyond financial transactions, encompassing every area of the Internet, from entertainment and social media to browser software. \n \n\n### NFTs, Gaming, and the Metaverse\n\n[NFTs](https://chain.link/education/nfts), blockchain gaming, and the [metaverse](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-the-metaverse/) are currently emerging as key pillars of the Web3 ecosystem. NFTs offer verifiable ownership of digital assets, allowing digital goods to have a functional level of uniqueness similar to that of items in the real world. With NFTs, one digital item can now be differentiated from another even if they present the same way, similar to how two copies of the same book can be differentiated through their unique markings and evidence of specific wear-and-tear. \n  \n This has massive implications for digital art, metaverse applications, and video games. Currently, NFT projects such as [Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) are popularizing NFTs and digital art, and blockchain games such as [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) are spearheading a paradigm shift in player economics in gaming. Underpinning this foundational transformation are blockchains, which operate as the underlying settlement layer, NFT smart contracts, which enable verifiable ownership of digital items, and decentralized oracles, which provide key services such as [verifiable randomness](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/), [smart contract automation](http://keepers.chain.link/), off-chain data, and more. \n \n\n### Parametric Insurance\n\nOne exciting use case emerging within the blockchain industry is decentralized [parametric insurance](https://blog.chain.link/blockchain-insurance/). Blockchain insurance projects such as [Arbol](https://www.arbolmarket.com/) and [Etherisc](https://etherisc.com/) are currently implementing novel implementations of frictionless and automated crop insurance, flight insurance, and more through a combination of smart contracts and off-chain data inputs facilitated by Chainlink Data Feeds. Let’s walk through a quick example. \n  \n Imagine a farmer requires more than 20 inches of rain in a season for an adequate crop harvest. The farmer wants to hedge against the risk of a bad harvest through insurance. Normally, he would have to go through a lengthy process to receive funds and need to rely on a centralized insurance provider to verify the amount of rainfall. \n  \n However, in Web3, anyone in the world can permissionlessly take on a policy with just an Internet connection. With the blockchain-based crop insurance provided by Arbol, the insurance cost and payout terms are automatically determined based on pre-defined parameters, and payment is automated through an insurance smart contract based on weather data provided Chainlink. The insurance process becomes quick and painless, with a simple binary that determines whether the farmer receives insurance funds. Did an IoT sensor record less than 20 inches of rain that season? If yes, pay the farmer immediately. If no, don’t pay the farmer. \n  \n This model has the ability to be expanded to areas such as [shipping](https://blog.chain.link/build-a-marine-insurance-smart-contract-with-chainlink/) and fire insurance, with blockchain-based parametric flight insurance already in operation. \n  \n \n\n## What’s Next for Web3\n\nIn his recent [Future of Chainlink presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YShbzR7mlog), Chainlink Co-founder Sergey Nazarov explained the emerging megatrends of the Web3 ecosystem that have recently pierced the mainstream: “What you really see with the implementation of cryptographic guarantees in the Web3 world is a very specific set of applications, and some of these applications are called DeFi, some of them are called NFTs, some of them are called tokenized ownership, but these are the very early examples of cryptographic guarantees making their way into people’s and industries’ daily operations.” \n \n\n![As people realize the power of cryptographic guarantees, they’ll move from centralized, probabilistic service providers to the trust-minimized services of Web3.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-A2JyPMbt4YwwJLdiYEP6.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n \n \n\nWeb3—a term that has become shorthand for a reimagined Internet experience powered by decentralized technologies—is already transforming how we interact online, from how we invest and exchange to how we play and express ourselves artistically. More and more users and institutions across the globe are waking up to the power of zero-trust interactions and cryptographically-backed agreements. While Web3 is still in its early stages, it has the potential to realize the ideals of hardwired transparency, reliability, and expediency the Internet was built to fulfill. “At the end of the day,” Nazarov noted, “as Web3 approaches the speed, the efficiency, and the low cost of web systems, it has a guarantee that no Web 2.0 system can ever have, which is the trust minimization cryptographic guarantee.”", "timestamp": 1658285826, "digest": "-5catWrSKnD26BzhPxyfRXUeUpCnHQWeQZU0XZT0UQs", "contributor": "0xe31e1beE0b954e20E39F049532fF403b2997b307"}

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第八篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一个周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658285829, "digest": "3iZyHuEbcoS9jkCN1JJgiXZEWSaX-CyYqW-PgIkeiwY", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

网络锁仓的加密资产总额（TVL）已超过 1.4 亿美元，7 日内增幅为 38%。zkSync 是基于 ZK Rollup 扩容方案实现的以太坊 Layer2 网络，目前，它的 TVL 增幅在众多 Layer2 网络中排名第一，这说明越来越多资金和用户正在体验 zkSync 网络及其应用。\n\n以太坊主网在正式升级为 2.0 之前，解决链上拥堵的方式之一是构建一个可以在链外执行大部分活动的 2 层网络（Layer2），以缓解对主网的计算及存储压力，增加以太坊的可扩展性。\n\n在各种构件 Layer2 网络的技术中，Rollup 逐渐被认为是最优解，因为它能将智能合约的实际计算和存储在链下完成，并将交易数据通过一系列压缩技巧批量提交并保存在以太坊主网上，无需单一数据一一验证。如此一来，layer2 网络的安全性不但能由以太坊主网保障，且不破坏网络的去中心化，还能增加网络的可扩展性和效率。更重要的是，Rollup 可以让以太坊主网的应用程序便捷地迁移至 Layer2。\n\n利用 Rollup 技术实现 Layer2 网络的构建，又因密码学的验证算法不同而形成了多种路径，Optimistic Rollup、ZK Rollup、Arbitrum Rollup 成为主流方案。目前，应用各种方案的 Layer2 网络均有所建树，各个流派分别在研发和实践中发展。\n\n其中，ZK Rollup 是利用「零知识证明」验证方式来落实 Rollup 的扩容方案，被以太坊创始人 Vitalik Buterin 视作 Layer2 的终极之选。\n\nzkSync 网络近期的 TVL 激增进一步验证了 x 的可行性，尤其是今年 2 月 zkSync 上线了 2.0 版本的公共测试网络以来，支撑它的 ZK Rollup 扩容技术方案也越来越受区块链技术社区关注。\n\n那么，ZK Rollup 扩容方案究竟是什么？与 Optimistic Rollup、Arbitrum Rollup 有何区别？除了 zkSync2.0，还有哪些网络使用了 ZK Rollup 技术？本期 DeFi 蜂窝将一一解答。\n\n### 简介\n\nZK Rollup 是基于「零知识证明」验证方式落实 Rollup 技术的 layer2 解决方案，「ZK」正是「Zero Knowledge」（零知识）的字母简称，该方案起源于 2018 年下半年，最早由区块链技术研究员 Barry Whitehat 提出。\n\n保留了 Rollup 技术的原理，ZK Rollup 可以在链下完成复杂计算，生成证明，传输回主网进行证明校验，并存储部分数据来保证数据可用性，且共享主网的安全性。\n\nZK Rollup 的特点正是那个「ZK」部分，「零知识证明」算法能让证明者在不向验证者提供任何有用信息的情况下，使验证者相信某个结果的正确性。\n\n举个例子，A 要向 B 证明自己拥有某个房间的钥匙，假设该房间只能用钥匙开锁，而其他任何方法都打不开。这时有 2 个方法：要么，A 把钥匙出示给 B，B 用这把钥匙打开房间的锁，从而证明 A 拥有该房间的正确钥匙；或者 B 确定该房间内有某一物体，A 用自己拥有的钥匙打开房门，然后把物体拿出来出示给 B，从而证明自己确实拥有该房间的钥匙。\n\n后面的方法就类似于零知识证明。它的优点在于，在整个证明的过程中，B 始终不能看到钥匙的样子，从而避免了钥匙的泄露。\n\n「零知识证明」对于强调隐私性的区块链来说是重要的技术手段，比特币网络就是应用之一。除了隐私性，技术研究人员也开始将其应用在提升区块链的性能方面，ZK Rollup 就是其一，它主张，若某个区块需要大量数据验证才能完成打包、开启下一个区块，不妨由一人验证并生成证明，而其他人来验证这个证明无误即可，这样就避免了每个人都要花很长时间来验证一个证明，从而提高数据验证的效率。\n\n在 ZK Rollup 方案下，Layer2 网络上的多个交易数据打包之后，会创建一个链下计算的「零知识证明」结果，主网（Layer1）验证者可以快速检查此证明是否正确。而且，正因为 Layer2 到 Layer1 的交易数据能即时验证，因此，它也能实现 Layer2 资产转移到 Layer1 时可以即时结算。\n\n### ZK Rollup 与其他 Rollup 方案的区别\n\nZK Rollup 是利用 Rollup 技术构建以太坊 Layer2 网络的一种实现方式，另一个主要是 Optimistic Rollup，二者的区别主要在于使用的验证算法不同。\n\nOptimistic Rollup 使用了「欺诈证明」验证算法，它的前提是验证者要在 Layer2 网络上质押一定数量 ETH「押金」，作为「不撒谎」的背书，如此前提下，它假设 Layer2 网络的交易均有效，提交到 layer1 (以太坊主网) 的数据都正确，如果有人对任何一笔交易提出异议，这个时候，数据才需要在以太坊主网上进行一一验证，哪个验证者提交的数据有问题，就会被网络判定为欺诈，那么这个验证人的押金被没收。\n\n在这样的验证算法原理下，当 Layer2 上汇总的每批交易提交到 Layer1 时，会有一个 7 天的异议提交周期。这也造成用户从 Optimistic Rollup 方案下的网络中提取或退出加密资产时，增加了一个 7 天的等待期。\n\n这不但造成了 Optimistic Rollup 相关网络的体验不友好，更麻烦的是，一旦出现异议数据，所有交易数据都要在主网上重新验证，反而增加了主网负担。\n\n于是，针对这个痛点，Arbitrum Rollup 在 Optimistic Rollup 上进行了改善，它主张把异议部分先进行划块处理，找出争议最大的部分，以太坊主网只对争议部分进行验证，以此缓解主网的验证负担。\n\n除此之外，Arbitrum Rollup 的进步还在于实现了与 EVM 的兼容，这就使得应用该技术的 layer2 网络可以承载以太坊主网上的应用无缝迁移，于是，不少 DeFi 应用选择部署「Arbitrum 版」。相较之下，Optimistic Rollup 扩容方案还没有做到 100% 兼容 EVM。\n\n可见，Arbitrum Rollup 方案算是 Optimistic Rollup 的「改进版」。尽管如此，资金从 Arbitrum Rollup 相关网络的退出时还是需要一个等待期，这个痛点还有待改善。\n\n而在与 EVM 的兼容方面，ZK Rollup 也此前一直难有突破。以太坊创始人 Vitalik Buterin（花名 V 神）曾在公开演讲中表示，ZK Rollup 由于底层技术较为复杂，想要做到完全兼容以太坊虚拟机可能需要几年时间，短期内，Optimistic Rollup 是以太坊扩容方案的可行之选，但长期而言会更倾向于 ZK Rollup。\n\nV 神这么一点评，ZK Rollup 被认为是以太坊扩容方案的「圣杯」。\n\n令人意外的是，ZK Rollup 兼容 EVM 的开发进度比预期快了许多。今年 2 月份，使用 ZK Rollup 方案的 zkSync 2.0 公测网上线，它兼容了 EVM。这意味着，在不久的将来，ZK Rollup 方案不再被束之高阁，基于它的网络将迎来应用的迁移。\n\n目前，ZK Rollup 方案的 Layer2 落地的主要选手是 StarkWare 和 zkSync。\n\n## zkSync 不断升级完成 EVM 兼容\n\n2019 年，MatterLabs 团队开始利用 ZK Rollup 扩容方案开发 zkSync 网络。2020 年 6 月，zkSync1.0 版本上线，主要聚焦于支付。作为 Layer2 扩容层，zkSync1.0 链上的转账手续费用极低，处理交易快速，且手续费不仅限于 ETH，利用该网络转账的其他以太坊标准资产也能用作手续费，资产进出以太坊主网一般在几分钟到几小时不等。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202203/5-1648172040274.png)\n\n*zkSync 官网*\n\n目前，用户可以通过授权以太坊钱包激活 zkSync 网络账户，ETH、ERC-20 标准下的 USDT 等资产可自由进出该网络，资产可与其他 zkSync 账户进行转移。\n\nzkSync1.0 由于不兼容 EVM，网络的可用性受到限制，能支持的应用场景非常有限，但由于转账费用低，到账即时，zkSync1.0 最主要的应用方向还是支付。\n\n今年 2 月，zkSync 2.0 版本的公共测试网上线，实现了 EVM 兼容，也因此成为首个利用 ZK Rollup 方案并兼容 EVM 的区块链网络。\n\nzkSync2.0 支持开发人员使用以太坊原生编程语言 Solidity 在网络上部署去中心化应用程序，以太坊主网上现有的 DeFi 应用也可以集成至 zkSync2.0 网络上，开发者和用户都低费用、高效率地使用这个 Layer2 网络。\n\n### 应用代表\n\n**去中心化交易应用（DEX）ZigZag**\n\nZigZag 没有采纳 DEX 常用的自动做市商（AMM）机制，而是采用去中心化订单簿模型，这正是 ZK Rollup 技术底层天然的「汇总性」带来的便利，它允许交易者以最小的滑点和高流动性订单进行现货交易，试图成为中心化交易所（CEX）在链上的替代方案。\n\n**Layer2 跨链桥 Orbiter Finance**\n\nOrbiter Finance 是为 Layer2 网络搭建的跨链桥，它支持 zkSync、Arbitrum、Optimism 等 Layer2 网络间的资产跨链转移，也支持 Layer2 和 Layer1 之间的资产互转。\n\n## StarkWare 系统化创建 Layer2\n\nStarkWare 可以视作一个公司，它创建于 2018 年，有一套完整的 Layer2 系统解决方案，特别是它在「零知识证明」基础上创新出 zkSTARK 算法，用以进一步增强网络的扩展性，并将这一算法进行了产品化，形成了 StarkNet（Layer2 扩容网络）和 StarkEx（扩容技术）两个落地模块。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202203/5-1648172094352.png)\n\n**StarkNet**\n\n它是搭建在以太坊上的 Layer2 网络，测试网已经于 2021 年 11 月上线，支持开发者进行应用部署，用户可以将交易发送到网络上，所有交易将定期进行批量处理，生成 STARK 证明，然后在以太坊主网验证这些证明。由于验证所需的计算内容很少，从而提升了链上的处理效率。\n\n由于 StarkNet 还未兼容 EVM，因此，它一直没有获得以太坊头部 DeFi 应用的迁移。目前，该 Layer2 上主要应用为去中心化交易应用（DEX）Myswap 和一站式交易应用 JediSwap\n\n**StarkEx**\n\n它是一套可扩容引擎技术，专门为以太坊应用提供扩容方案和程序服务，已经用于不少知名去中心化应用，包括去中心化永续合约交易应用 dYdX、去中心化交易应用 DeversiFi、NFT 生态系统 Immutable X。\n\n作为期货交易平台，dYdX（DYDX）需要高速结算， StarkEx 帮助它大大提高了结算速度，增强了用户体验。\n\nDeversiFi 是首个采用 StarkEx 扩容引擎的 DEX，它使用的是订单簿模式，实现方式是链下处理交易、链上完成结算。以往，链上结算的方式对链的性能要求较高，Layer1 类型的网络对此存在制约。现在，StarkEx 引擎解决了这一点，它为非托管式交易提供了即时结算、高流动性、低滑点等保障。此外，DeversiFi 使用了 zkSTARK 算法的隐私层，很好地保证了用户的交易隐私。\n\nImmutable X 是以太坊针对 NFT 资产设置的 Layer2 扩容方案，它基于 StarkEx 引擎搭建，该网络上的资产及交易数据均由以太坊保障，用户无需担心安全问题。更重要的是，StarkEx 支持提取资产到以太坊链上即时到账，没有 7 天的间隔期。目前，卡牌游戏 Gods Unchained（GODS）、战斗类角色扮演游戏 Illuvium (ILV) 等已选择与 Immutable X 集成，为用户提供快速的、0 Gas 费的交易体验。", "timestamp": 1658285357, "digest": "lHVJKCk9aTbhWCKKc81EwgUqjJZ-yejOTcV26jzXs80", "contributor":

Because in the past, they flew in the sky and rarely looked down. Therefore, for a long time, Although he passed by here, he didn't know that there were so many interesting people and interesting things in such a vast land. In this new place, he met many new friends, the chattering mole and the boasting hare. , Porcupines who are not good at speech, they quickly became close \"comrades-in-arms\". The happiest time for them is when night falls, outside the porcupine's residence, looking at the stars and talking about the distance, although the geese have been to many places, But in every place, he only knew a little bit, and he didn't know more details. One day, the porcupine said, Dayan, I have a friend who has admired you for a long time and wanted to get to know you, but he is not very convenient to move. Can I go see him sometime?

Dandelion, Dandelion said to Dayan, Sister Dayan, I have a dream since I was a child. I want to be like my ancestors, to fly to the farthest place that I think I can reach. Can you tell me what the distance is like? Is it beautiful from afar? Dayan was at a loss for words, he didn't know how to start, he didn't know what this idiot-like question was referring to, in order to save face, Dayan began to talk about it, there are wonderful waterfronts, and there is an inexhaustible supply of them. , there is... After a nonsense, the mole fell asleep, the hare knitted the sweater in his hand, and only the porcupine was still listening to the geese's boast. On the way back, the porcupine said to Dayan: \"Dayan, you and I have met once, and I want to ask you something, okay?\" Dayan said, \"Go ahead! I know that one day, you will leave here. , you will fly to your destination, I just want you to make some space for the dandelion, okay?

On that day, moles, porcupines, and hares will all come to see them off. The geese are ready to take off with their blessings, entrustment, and nostalgia. The air blew on the dandelion, the wild goose took off, the porcupine, the mole, and the hare ran with him for a long time, until they turned into a small black spot in the distance, and flew for a long time, the dandelion looked at a valley in the distance, and the wild goose Said: \"Goose, my distant place is not the fertile fertile field you mentioned. My ancestors told us that the distant place of dandelion is a barren valley. Our dream is to wait for one day to fill the valley with bright yellow flowers in spring.

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第八篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并持续推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一次周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n原文：\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n编译：\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658285969, "digest": "B7sXp44pe6A0Emj8ZlEHBM3M5ahKifjInjXGqbluO_Q", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第八篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并持续推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一次周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n原文：\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n编译：\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658286041, "digest": "pNWEv5f2BlVx-CTwx53kQnhIv7WjaDcRO0_cnZJ7YXk", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第八篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并持续推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一个周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658285839, "digest": "wJas-cLLVaTUlab8AEnGY_aQFPKRoEec-nYr1iPo0no", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

You will hear a \"beep\" sound, and in this \"beep\" sound, of course, there are eggs, but at the same time, there is the head that touched head-on.\n​​\nSome people have calculated that an egg weighing 30 grams will cause a swollen head if it falls from the 4th floor, the scalp will be damaged if it falls from the 8th floor, and the skull will be broken if it falls from the 18th floor. Falling from the 25th floor can cause death on the spot.\n​​\nA fragile egg becomes extremely powerful when it has a certain height and speed.\n​​\nSo, don't underestimate an egg, and as an egg, don't underestimate yourself. A weak egg, with the corresponding conditions, can make a hard rock tremble with fear.\n​​\nSecond, the professor said that there are two ways to break an egg.

When you are still an egg, why do you want to hit the stone hard?\n​​\nYou know your fragility, you know you can't beat a hard rock, but why do you still touch it?

Tap the top of the egg lightly to break it, allowing the egg to stand up. But the egg that stands up like this is at the cost of maiming and destroying an egg. Cruel damage can make an egg stand up.\n​​\nHow to make an egg stand up? Make a mold and put the eggs in the mold so the eggs can stand up. Moderate restraint allows the egg to stand up.\n​​\nHow to make an egg stand up? Make a stand and place the egg on the stand so the egg will stand up. External support allows the egg to stand up.\n​​\nLetting an egg stand up is like letting a person's life stand up. What method do you choose to make your life stand up?\n​​\n5\\. Once, a friend put an egg in my palm and asked me to hold it hard to see if I could hold the broken egg. But no matter how hard I try, I can't hold the egg in my hand.\n​​\nUsually, an egg can be broken with a single tap. Why is it that an egg in the palm of your hand cannot be broken even if you try your best to hold it?\n​​\nA friend said that we usually knock an egg and focus the target on a point of the egg. It seems that the force used is small, but when the target is concentrated, the force acting on the egg is also larger; Covering the whole egg, our grip strength is spread over the entire surface of the egg. It seems that the force used is large, but once the force is dispersed, the force acting on the egg is also smaller.

Investor）、MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）。以下是直播内容摘录：**\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n欢迎大家来参加今天的推特 Space，今天非常有幸请到 Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）作为分享嘉宾，先有请他做一下自我介绍。\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\nHello 大家好，我是 Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人，今天非常高兴有机会聊聊关于艺术 NFT 的演变之路的想法，欢迎大家一块参与讨论。\n\n**MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）**\n\n我们今天也是同时邀请到 Theirsverse 的 Co-founder Hyphen，首先我个人也是非常喜欢 Theirsverse 的理念，强调“跨过分歧、拥抱不同”的核心概念，引起了 Z 世代的强烈共鸣，也可以说是真正将社会议题融入到 NFT 艺术品的理念中。同时恭喜 Theirsverse 经过一年的筹备，在昨天白名单 Mint 阶段全部售罄，那么先请 Hyphen 简单介绍一下自己。\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Theirsverse）**\n\nhello 大家好，我是 Theirsverse 的创始人和艺术总监，很高兴今天有机会跟大家介绍 Theirsverse 的发起和理念，也很期待跟大家一起聊天。\n\n@**guooooog**\n\n大家好，我是毕业于中央美院实验艺术学院，现在主要从事生成艺术方面的创作。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n今天的话我们都知道， James Jeans NFT Holder 可以在 Outland 线上兑换实体版画，谁有资格获得？非 holder 或者其他人有无可能/怎样参与其中？\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\nOutland 今天正式上线了 James Jeans NFT 项目，大家可以凭借自己的积分去兑换一张对应到自己 NFT 编号的实体版画，这个版画有专属钢印和 James Jeans 签名。\n\n我们推出这样的实体版画原因有两个，第一是想通过新的玩法，也就是积分和 Merch 之间的配合，让大家了解其实 NFT 可以跟线下产生联动、产生赋能。这种积分机制和之前出现过的 实体作品以及 NFT 销毁不太一样，比如说达米安·赫斯特先生推出的方式。同时这也是我们预期的可以去激励到 NFT 流动性的一种方式。\n\n第二点其实这是 James Jeans 自己的想法，他看到大家的热情，对于第二个章节的期待，就希望能够给大家更多福利和关怀，让大家可以亲手触碰到艺术，让艺术品进入到大家的生活空间当中。\n\n基于这两个原因，Outland 在现在这个时间点推出 Merch 平台，也算是回馈社区的小小努力。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n对于 NFT 一直以来最大的争议就是，买 NFT 就是买 JPEG 甚至是买空气，那么像这次兑换实体版画的活动算是给了相关言论一个有力的还击。Outland是如何与世界范围内头部的艺术家共同构平台愿景的？近期有什么样的计划和大家分享？\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\n之前并没有像 web3 区块链这样的技术以及社区，能够帮助艺术家第一时间和对自己作品感兴趣、喜爱自己创作的朋友达成一个连接。比如说像方力钧老师、James Jeans 以及我们未来要推出的艺术家，他们最开始了解到 web3 和区块链的时候，更多的印象这就是一个技术，但实际上当这个技术落地到社区建设、作品研发和平台发行的过程当中去的话，就发现是非常有血有肉有细节的。\n\n我们发现很多艺术家非常有意愿能够多做一些什么，能够和喜爱自己作品的朋友达成一种连接。在这样一个背景之下，我们觉得并不一定非要区别所谓的 NFT 和线下艺术品之间的明确界限，我们相信当不同的产业和领域都落地到 web3 当中的时候，线下和线上联动会更加紧密。\n\n在这样一个愿景之下，艺术家和 Outland 平台一起做了个未来规划，也就是说之后所有上线的作品肯定在某些方面有前瞻性或者创新性的，我们希望 Outland 能够将原来在殿堂之内的艺术带到大家生活当中去的一个中间桥梁这么一个平台。\n\n**MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）**\n\n我想问一下 Hyphen，你在纽约的所⻅所闻是否对你的艺术创作产⽣了影响，你在这个年纪为什么会思考平等並且关注不同肤色人种的权利？那么Theirs NFT 在后期会有什么赋能呢?\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Theirsverse）**\n\n我是大概两年前去纽约，我从小在台北长大，接受的是美国教育体制。所以并不是到纽约才有这种感觉，从小我就能够感受到文化冲突，在学校的时候可能会觉得自己像一个美国人，虽然我不觉得自己是美国人，但表现得比较美式，回到家聊天又会比较传统一点。\n\n所以小时候成长过程我就不太有归属感，跟我们这边称之为“很台”的那些人没办法打上真正的交道，但是跟老外也没办法完全融入，我一直到现在都是跟国际学校的人比较好。这种没有归属感到纽约之后更加凸显，小时候以为只有我这样，到了纽约之后发现大家都这样，因为纽约很少土生土长的人，我认识的都是从不同世界不同地方来的人。\n\n我觉得很重要的一部分是，世界越来越国际化，每个国家都是。过了二十三十年，我不会很意外每个国家都充满不同的人群。那我觉得从现在就要开始为这种国际化的到来做准备。因为从小我长大的地方都是亚洲人，到国外有很多文化差异，不止是要去尊重，还要去学习。如果你不去学习的话，不会知道要如何待遇别人，这种世界观是蛮重要的。\n\n在纽约身为少数民族的亚洲人或者黑人、或者无性别主义者，或者 LGBT 人群，这些不是主流群组的人，我觉得我们看了美国的历史，才发现抗争了那么久猜到了这个（平等）的地步。当世界慢慢国际化，网络让世界被拉拢起来，我们需要知道的一件事情是，不能在重复这种错误，重复有哪一种族群比另外一个族群强大的观念，而不只是扣上说说而已。\n\n但是现在的种族歧视可能更隐晦，比如我到了美国，可能跟我国内朋友说中文的时候，有一个白人就跟我说，你说韩文的声音真好听。其实我想说我已经跟你说过几百遍，我是在讲中文，这两种语言在我们听起来是天差地别的。\n\n虽然他们不是恶意，我觉得身为亚洲人，我们对黑人和白人也会有各种偏见，那么要去除这些标签，包括肤色、性向、性别、贫富差距、年纪差异，不是我们看不到差别，反而要去欣赏，更加升华他们的文化，这是 Theirsverse 很重要的一个人物。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n如何看待NFT对艺术行业的影响，web3对当代艺术家的创作到底是冲击还是帮助？所谓的传统艺术家和NFT原生艺术家是否有本质上的不同？艺术家该如何加入到NFT的世界中来？\n\n@**guooooog**\n\n原生加密艺术家跟传统当代艺术家还是有很大区别。\n\n首先是原生加密艺术家熟悉整个加密赛道的玩法跟规则，甚至很多加密艺术家是程序员，非常熟悉计算机美学、代码美学和匿名性。刚才 Hyphen 提到种族平等的问题，web3 等于把所有人拉平了，我其实更喜欢匿名艺术家，而不是实名艺术家。\n\n因为实名之后，艺术家的身份和背景资料都会被看到，当然现在还是 web2.5 阶段，信任机制还没有那么完善，匿名性是 web3 很重要的一个属性，不管你是什么背景、什么资历，只要作品好、表达的内容非常有意思，提供给行业的东西有创新性，大家就是认可的。\n\n所以说这是非常好的一件事，也是 web3 最有意思的一个部分，因为传统当代艺术圈有很多问题，比如权利集中化，由策展人、美术馆这种机构、评论家、画廊、拍卖行整个体系形成了一个标准，如果这种标准一直持续下去，是会形成非常垄断和精英化的局面。\n\n当然现在包括 Artblocks 在内也是这种有点传统的方式去输出作品，也有一些平台不是这种玩法，我觉得未来会越来越少，因为现在是 web2.5 还没有完全去除这些东西。\n\n不管是当代艺术家还是加密艺术家，代码、程序和区块链技术，底层逻辑都是一种媒介跟语言，他们都可以基于这种语言去创作一些很好的作品。但是对 web3 不太熟悉的当代艺术家来说相对还是有一些困难的。就像文艺复兴时期透视学的出现、油画语言的出现、包括能够随身携带颜料去快速画一些户外风景，这些其实都是技术带来的革命，本质就是一种语言。\n\n当代艺术家在传统语言体系已经把握了这种玩法，语言熟练程度非常高，但是加密艺术是一套新的体系和新的语言，当代艺术家需要熟悉这种语言才能创作出很好的作品。对于加密艺术家来说，也要熟悉一些当代艺术和传统艺术圈的玩法跟体系，才能创作出更好的作品。\n\n当然很多传统艺术圈的人进入到加密艺术之后会被啪啪打脸，是因为加密艺术圈的很多玩法和体系跟传统是不一样的。从某种程度上说，其实 NFT 是一种革新和范式，它需要去迎合原来当代艺术的标准吗，我认为完全不需要。这两个领域可能是相互融合相互促进的并行状态，它们并不打架。\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\n在最开始我们去接触艺术家的过程中，发现尤其是一些年龄比较大的艺术家，对于整个区块链和 NFT 技术可能没有一个明确的概念。但是，以我从策划阶段跟方力钧老师接触为例，当代艺术家有一个优势，就是天然骨子里去反叛、去革新、去突破系统性桎梏的意识，其实 Outland 就要做这个桥梁作用，让他怎么能够意识到能够利用技术去做这些事情，在一个新的语境当中有东西可以去表达。在这个过程中我们遇到了很多困难，将困难一一化解之后形成了现在项目的一个基本局面。\n\n但是我想聊的东西要稍微深层一点，就是什么是艺术。在我看来的话，艺术是能触碰人心灵的东西，不管是当代艺术家还是 web3 原生艺术家，其实肯定有一些东西是打动你了。有一个项目是来自印尼的小伙子，把自己每天的照片拍了一年，放到 Opensea 上，卖得还是非常好的。其实这个东西在我看来有一个打动人的地方，就是在 web2 当中并不会引起大家注意的一个东西，在 web3 得到一个价值的肯定。\n\n所以我觉得应该找到一个东西，无论是现代的还是传统的，都是一个工具，可以帮助我们去穿通歧视和不公平，能够让大家意识到好的氛围和有趣的地方，这是 web3 打动我的地方。\n\nweb3 突破了原有作品的边界，把作品边界和真正购买 NFT 的人连接到一起，中间的这个过程其实具备很大的革新性，让艺术家和对自己作品感兴趣的人连接到一起。\n\n从这个角度来看，这也是符合艺术的规律。之前艺术的革新只发生在作品的内部，未来到了 NFT 领域可以将革新从创作的单边过程，变成一个完全双向或者多向的过程。我相信这是无论当代艺术家还是加密艺术家非常友好的地方。\n\n**@AnnieYi**\n\nHello 大家伙，很高兴能够邀请 Hyphen 这么年轻的艺术家和 Outland 这样的优秀平台一起 AMA，我感到非常荣幸和骄傲。\n\n其实我自己是 James Jeans NFT 的持有人，Hyphen 知道我非常喜欢他，在全球买他的版画。但是我要说一下，我觉得碎片化的叙事方式，并没有把 JJ 的叙事性打破。我自己很喜欢的一点事，他的画特别有趣，有非常多的细节，每一朵花每一个角落，每一件东西都有诗意般的叙事能力，但是当它拆成 NFT 之后，变成了不同的叙事碎片，其实既可以拆解，又可以拼起来，所以艺术变成 NFT 是一个特别梦幻的联动。\n\n比如说来自 16 个国家的艺术家并没有见过面，更多的就是透过一个核心叙事，大家共同创造，通过机器随机生成，生出全球独一无二的样子。所以如果打开 Opensea 看到那些图多么丑，由科学家在淘宝随便找个人画的土狗项目的时候，你真的觉得艺术应该要进入 NFT 里面，因为我们把整体艺术交给全球有钱的买家，很多商人到最后靠买艺术品展现自己的品牌，有些商人会开以自己名字命名的美术馆，像美国纽约那边有很多，来供大家欣赏。你会发现艺术一直是一个非常高成本的东西，但是通过 NFT 让每一个年轻人享受审美，持有审美，而且是全球独一无二随机性的审美，这是一个很浪漫的过程。\n\nHyphen 也可以分享一下，他在做 Theirsverse 的时候，其实是有很大的核心思想，他认为艺术不是一个自私跟自我满足的过程，每一个持有人都参与了创作。我认为 NFT 跟艺术未来是应该紧紧绑在一起。\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Theirsverse）**\n\n我觉得很重要的一点是 web3 的去中心化概念，不仅是技术上的去中心化，同时也是理念上的。不再看什么是主流、什么是非主流，什么是正确的审美，什么是不正确的审美。\n\nTheirsverse 的 Slogan 就是“不完美，即是完美”。这个完美不是说每个人都有自己的完美，现在社会对完美只有一个一致的定义，同时这个定义又在变化，很多人回去盲目跟随。特别是在web2 社交媒体上，很多人去看网红，修图美颜到完全不真实的姿态，全部都很自我。web3 所有都和你的环境和社群有关，非主流才是真正的主流，每个人都可以找到喜欢自己艺术创作形态的人，我觉得这是很重要的，这是 web3 最看好的地方。\n\n很多人对 web3 有质疑，这也是可以理解的。我经常跟朋友你去想手机是好是坏，好的地方是你可以随时跟亲戚、朋友、恋人说话，很方便很发达，但同时也有隐私这些问题，最终还是取决于用户。\n\n我不能以 web3 做保证，但是我能保证我们的社区是以连接人们为中心的，我希望做一种互动性的艺术，而不是 everything is about me，像是在一个艺术馆里面去看一副作品。我大概一开始作画的时候就有这种感觉，不是以自私的心态去创作艺术，反而是以交流的心态，比言语更升华的一种互动。所以 Theirsverse 是一个平等的多元文化的社群。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n从 Beeple 的 NFT 拍出 6900万 美元天价一举成名开始，似乎代表着 NFT 开始带着艺术行业走向另一个全新的方向，但是 Merch 某种程度上意味着艺术的价值正在向传统靠拢，怎么看待这种反叛与回归的结合？\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\n我们一开始的时候其实也请教到像 Beeple 这些在 web3 非常成功的艺术家，有关于艺术这个赛道在未来的发展方向。同时也有很多其他朋友接触到我们来聊可以不可以进入加密艺术领域。我相信像娱乐、电影、大众流行文化相关的东西，落地到 web3 当中去的时候，可能我们现在的讨论都不再是一个问题，包括它应该是更倾向于线上，还是要和线下联动，我觉得也不再是一个问题，到那个时间点我期待的是物联网的达成，区块链作为底层技术更加方便的生活场景的普及，那时候应该不存在传统艺术还是 web3 艺术，只存在大家喜欢或者不喜欢的艺术，无论是传统艺术像加密艺术反叛或者反过来，都是可以随时发生和接受的。\n\n比如说我们接下来即将要推出的一个项目，可能会一反像 James Jeans 从观念故事性上去推出的 NFT，和实物之间有一个密切的连接。现在这个项目是技术导向的，我们从 Artblock 等生成艺术上获得了很多灵感，就是在目前这个时间点，我们应该把艺术往哪个方向去浅浅地推进一下，其实在一个比较广泛的视野当中，还缺少一个原生于区块链属性的作品，我们和艺术家之间进行沟通，去创作一个这样的作品，通过 AI 算法根据你的交易判断性格，做出时间线上的变化，哪怕交易之后也能够记住上一个主人的特点，这也是一个非常不一样的角度，一个非常原生 web3 的角度去跟艺术家合作。\n\n所以我们其实并没有限定我们自己是传统的，还是 web3 的，我们更希望看到更多有趣的项目通过各种各样的方式出现，当这样的东西越来越多的时候，那可能这个问题就会消失掉。\n\n**@AnnieYi**\n\n我其实蛮遗憾的，大家提到 Beeple 的时候都在关注拍出了多么高的价格，是不是第一个艺术 NFT，却没有人看过这一幅画。我想应该没有人像我一样，认认真真去打开 5000 幅画来看吧，他其实是把这十四年的生活，每一天画一幅画。成为数字艺术之后，可以碎片化去持有，想象我是一个有钱人去买了这个 NFT，我把我家的墙投影出来这 5000 张画，这就是一堆数码影像，但是当我把它每一张打开的时候，有几幅画是我自己非常非常喜欢的。我希望大家在理解艺术之前，要了解它是怎么撼动人心的。\n\n虽然 Therisverse 很幸运，发行 4 个小时就售罄，在熊市 0.18e 也不算便宜，很多 freemint 项目都没有发完也没有人领。我们在 24 小时登上了 Opensea 第五名。但是我依然希望大家看到这 16 个年轻的艺术家，每一个系列背后的灵魂，每一幅画都画了好久。我们总共做了 4 次生成，这在其他项目绝无仅有，包括 Hyphen 他很坚持一些东西。所以说不要看成绩有多少，整个 Theirsverse 艺术创作花了一整年，而 Beeple 用了十四年，没有人知道，认为他只是一个普通插画师，他的老婆怀孕，他穷得不行的时候没有人看见。\n\n所以这也是我非常喜欢 Outland，在整个 web3 行业里面的作用。当你在熊市中打开小狐狸钱包，不是一张丑到不行的作品，没有任何审美意义。你知道这是艺术家付出了时间，是艺术家的心血，付出了跟世界的对话，跟自己的和解，跟世界的抗争。Hyphen 在画的时候是一个卡夫卡的读者，是一个虚无主义的小孩，他把 Theirsverse 画得像翻白眼一样，我是怕卖不出去，但是他有他的抗争。\n\n所以每一个艺术背后都不是随随便便的，我自己比较遗憾的一件事情是，像 BAYC 背后的画家，到现在已经几乎完全被遗忘了，而且她还是一个亚裔。所以艺术一定要有改革，排挤出那些土狗项目和仿盘，发挥出中本聪真正去中心化的理念，让更多年轻的艺术家不用等到 45 岁或者更久之后，才有机会出来跟跟大家交流，这是 web3 最大的价值。\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Theirsverse）**\n\n我好像是 15 岁左右，开始喜欢法国哲学家，对存在学很有兴趣，会读卡夫卡那类的书。我印象很深刻的一个主题是，我们人类的存在比我们的理由先到来。我读的时候有点奔溃，人类这么有智慧的生物，有那么多无尽的选择，我们其实活在一个最差的宇宙。我们有那么多选择，反而活得那么忐忑和慌张，运作在腐朽的政治之上，女生不能主宰自己的身体，他们如果不想生一个小孩，还要违法去堕胎。所以那时候我想做另一个宇宙，大家都可以更好做自己的版本，那个对我来说成长影响蛮大的。\n\n@**guooooog**\n\nNFT 纯数字化和经典的实物艺术作品，这里面有一个词叫在场，很多艺术创作印刷出来看和你现场欣赏完全是不一样的。NFT 有“在场”吗，在场性还很低，当你用眼睛去看手机、看一个屏幕，范围很小，未来如果 AR/ VR 起来之后，在元宇宙里面去看，场景是不一样的。所以实物还是解决了一些在场性的问题，就是你观看屏幕和你拿到实物去细细地品是不一样的，我觉得这是很有意思的一个事情。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\nOutland 作为艺术类 NFT 运营得非常好的平台，非常注重线上线下的互通以及社区文化的建设，请问艺术类 NFT 可以为不能从美术馆、拍卖会的购买艺术品（高净值客户，物单价高），大多数人带来什么？\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\n这也是传统艺术会面临的问题。之前跟方老师之间有一个聊天，有些很大牌的艺术家进入一个误区，当他背后有一个非常有实力的人可以去支持他创作自由的达成，在原来中心化时代里面，他们做的一个事情就是把源远流长的艺术史价值化了，这个东西的背书要远远大于某一方的努力，如果 outland 只是从运营和市场价值角度把桥梁搭建起来，其实还是需要一个新的推动建立在大家的共识之上，很多土狗项目有值得大家学习的地方，就是他们在凝结共识的过程当中可以摒弃很多不同的意见，那这个东西的话其实在传统艺术是完全没有出现的。我们应该如何去看待呢，你发现很多土狗项目虽然过几天就下去了，但是并没有如大家想象的那样完全归零，反而是最开始建构得非常好的项目，最后可能并不是运营得特别好。所以到底什么是最核心最主要的，这是一个很有意思的问题。\n\n另外一方面来讲，高净值用户和人群，他们进入艺术之前的惯性，是这个时代局限决定的。我也跟很多线下的投资人和收藏家聊过天，其实他们对传统的美术馆的话也不是很满意。那 NFT 出现之后，我还是这个观点，现在客观情况出现了明显的分野，但是后续发展不见得不可以把 web2 比较有价值的作品带到 web3 里面来。比如说我们在 Merch 之后的安排当中，方老师可能愿意拿出自己不同时期留藏得版画作品，拿出来到 Merch 当中去，让大家更多从价值角度体会到 web3 时代的到来。\n\n**MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）**\n\n想问一下 **Hyphen** 你是如何跟全球十多位艺术家合作，怎么领导设计这些pfp，有什么意义\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Theirsverse）**\n\n我们设计环节最重要的一部分就是全部手绘的，每一个艺术家自己选择要做什么 collection，每个人都会研究很久。其中一个核心概念就是，如果我们要讲一个不是我们的故事，不是有历史年代性和文化根底的故事，一定要穿透到表达的本质。我非常执着于研发的过程，其中一个 collection 印象蛮深刻的，本以为会是很浮夸和女性化的，我看到之后反而觉得特别好，并没有哪些固有的预设，并且是在我和那位艺术家完全没有串通好的情况下。\n\n还有另一个 collection 特别能体现目前年轻人的迷惘跟堕落感，活在一个科技感，但是又随时有可能被战争和政治毁灭的世界，我觉得蛮能体现自己对未来的憧憬和现况的失望，对我自己冲击蛮大的。我没有问那个艺术家是不是有这样的创作意图，但是我自己看到的感觉是这样的。这也就是我为什么觉得艺术这么有趣，因为每个人都有自己的解读和深刻的体会。\n\n**MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）**\n\n我们知道Theirsverse计划设立年轻艺术家基金，并且已经在全球多地开展青年论坛，Hyphen可以具体分享一下吗?\n\n因为最开始做这个项目史灵光一闪，最开始跟我妈开了一个买手店，放了一些名牌产品。我就想这些牌子都已经这么有名了，还需要我们帮忙卖吗，直接去旗舰店买不就好了。我觉得反而这种买手店需要给更多年轻艺术家平台，不仅仅是衣服、还包括音乐、艺术等等。那时候我就觉得要做这么一个平台，让年轻艺术家把自己作品宣发到全世界的媒介。\n\n因为我觉得传统的艺术阶层很分明，如果你红的话可以一直红下去，如果没红的话就永远不会红，很棒的是经过这么多年，我们有了 web3 这么一种技术跟机会，成立年轻艺术家基金会，给那些比我还有才华，又没有那么多资源的艺术家扶持。\n\n我们会组织各种各样的论坛，每个人都要跟世界有交流，第一是去了解跟你不一样的人，第二是看到即使我们在完全不同的体系长大，感受到的情绪可以是一样的，每一个打动人的故事都可以引发共鸣，我们做这个平台就是要产生不同的共鸣，这是对我来说很重要的东西，找到一种宇宙性的语言，让世界各地的艺术家来讲故事，每个人都可以讲自己的故事，还可以了解到你的故事是有人聆听的。在这么一个安全的地方讲故事之后，可以再去现实世界讲更多的故事。\n\n\n---\n\n```\n

That is the place where I used to work and live for eight years. A soft care.\n\nThe mountain wind blows the morning mist, like strips of white satin, gently and slowly, wrapping the scattered villages with a thin layer of soft yarn. The bamboo buildings with unique style and unique style are hidden by big banyan trees, mango orchards and coconut groves by the side of the village. When you look around, everything here is dyed emerald green.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t1c6DXM1QLLBdplrVws3R.png?height=270&width=402)\n\nKapok on the edge of the village, with open arms, blooming with red buds, can't wait for the foil of green leaves to ignite the passion. Amorous peach blossoms, like pink clouds, are printed and dyed among the green trees, like the blush on the face of a shy girl, adding a bit of tenderness. The paddy field stretches out to the side of the mountain, blooming among the bamboo trees, and sketching among the paddy fields. The rice fields in spring are even more fascinating. When the industrious children of the Dai people plant the seedlings on the side of the mountain, they also endow the rice fields with extra beauty. The scattered rice fields are filled with clear mountain springs, such as the magic mirror scattered among the mountains of Ailao, reflecting the colorful clouds, splendid rainbows, everything in the world, and the most beautiful scenery in the world. The sun shines on the water, emitting sparkling waves. The vast tranquility and tranquility, the same mottled and overflowing reflection, is like a landscape painting, supporting a thick and dignified line of blue sky. Relying on diligence and intelligence, the Dai family has created a splendid imprint of civilization here. Pieces of rice fields connect the Dai villages, mountains and nature so harmoniously.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vgdMnAdP2COSuiS-pmgpS.png?height=266&width=414)\n\nStepping on the bamboo bridge, bypassing the water-filled stream, I was immersed in an ancient dream. There was a mist of rain in the sky, only the sound of the rain falling on the bananas, and only the light raindrops fell on the newly-haired green leaves and safflower, which made the natural green and red look so delicate. The drizzle was lingering, and the whole village was moistened. The green rain and fog lingered like a thin white veil, covering the strangeness of the village, but it also added a bit of mystery to the original beautiful scenery.\n\nStanding on the bamboo building paved by Miba, the greenery of Bazi came to his eyes. Coconut groves are chasing green clouds, sugar cane overflows with mellow sweetness, and tea leaves are fragrant and intoxicating everywhere. There are dense greens everywhere, and green tides everywhere. Looking at the sky and the earth, occasionally a shadow of the mountains is revealed. Among the green waves, the big banyan trees that cover the ground, the verdant phoenix-tailed bamboos, and the fruit-bearing betel nut all decorate the charming Dai bamboo buildings.\n\nFlowing quietly through the small river between the bamboo buildings, slapping the eternal dream of the bamboo buildings. The stockade was quiet. In the depths of the bamboo forest, a girl from the Dai family walked by carrying water, and her long tube skirt swayed with Ana's body. Dai girls are demons made of water, and water is the soul of the Dai family. The bamboo building is accompanied by water, and the sound of the spring is ding-dong, adding a kind of leisure, a kind of elegance, a kind of calm, not to mention the water here, and the bamboo building. Natural harmony, simple and beautiful bamboo building, inherits the gentleness of water and the eternity of spring!\n\nThe fragrance of dendrobium flowers fills the bamboo building, the cactus fence is full of flowers, the phoenix-tailed bamboo is rustling, the mango can be touched, and the grapefruit that bends the branches is beating against the eaves of the bamboo building. Walking into the bamboo building, the gentle and watery Dai girl will come slowly, bring a cup of glutinous rice fragrant tea, gently put the tea down, and then smile. The colorful tube skirt, the fragrant breath, the faint tea fragrance, and the sweet smile, like a dancing peacock. Walking into the quiet and peaceful bamboo building, you will have the feeling of past life and present life. This feeling, as if traveling through the ancient time and space, waiting for thousands of years, fluttering in the heart.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2Z5BWaIQexkgD6shdN8pR.png?height=266&width=463)\n\nThe sunset is gradually melted away by the green, and the sunset is dressed in a light green and beautiful wedding, slowly pulling the full moon behind the mountain. Cicada Feather's moonlight slides from the roof to the balcony. The tall banana leaves slowly hold up Haoyue, the moon in Dai Village, savoring the green night sky, and feeling the vicissitudes of time. The rain forest is soft and moist, the coconut trees are slim, and the phoenix tails and bamboos are affectionate. Sitting on the balcony paved by Zhuba, the laughter washed away the exhaustion. At this time, the bamboo building is full of warmth, auspiciousness and happiness.\n\nIn the aroma of tea, the moonlight comes from the branches and leaves, and diffuses into the lake of people's hearts. The gurgling water in the bamboo forest, now reflected in the moonlight, looks particularly cool. The breeze is coming, and the night sky is filled with fragrant fragrance, which makes people excited, and the feeling of a lifetime is suddenly lifted. In the verdant phoenix-tailed bamboo forest in front of the bamboo building, Xiaobu's long and affectionate singing, accompanied by the chirping of insects, drifted far and far with the evening wind.\n\nThe gentle singing, flowing with the breath of the Dai family, is soft and soft, like a hand plucking your heartstrings, the original Dai family charm will always be lingering in my heart. At this time, the moon became charming and beautiful, and the Dai girl who was bathing by the river felt comfortable, shy, and laughter with silver bells. The brisk drum beats and the melodious sound of gongs flew to my ears. The girl from the Dai family who followed the sound walked towards the boy who was like a madman, dancing lightly on the moon, singing flowing water. The girls looked at their lover with honey-flowing eyes, and colorful sunlight flashed in their eyes. Shuangshuang hides under the big banyan tree, or sits in the banana bush, the flowers are fragrant, the moonlight is melting, and the two loving hearts turn into thousands of words to pour out their hearts. With a little relief, the bamboo building in the wind is slowly intoxicated.\n\nThe bamboo building under the moonlight is extraordinarily enchanting, and this bamboo building is an eternal witness. It reflects the tenderness and the vicissitudes of life. On such a moonlit night, sitting quietly in front of the window of the bamboo building, the night wind blows the bamboo forest, The moonlight and the singing meet, and at this time, there is a quiet mood, which dissolves in the emotion of life like a dream.\n\nThe bamboo building under the moonlight and the bamboo building in the wind have also become my soft concern. The moon is still full of fantasy, people have been separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, but the same deep thoughts.", "timestamp": 1658287238, "digest": "EFduuWFn8eHanOhfBOY5zSuVKHJTNJEf-wsWiquBim0", "contributor": "0xfE5d245154a4B93d296B3A8F9128e4fcC35DEb80"}
{"id": "R0AWJrUqfteCqy5-YVMjeRtPSIhEh64pZGcIi2vdH1U", "title": "#Winning", "body": "This week I had planned to write on the topic of doxing, or more specifically, about the question of “to dox or not to dox”, and the choice for, or against, web3 anonymity. As inspired as I initially felt to explore it, once I sat down to outline it the work began to feel like a grind. Then, as I often do these days when feeling stuck, I turned my attention to twitter for a daily download of crypto news and DAOist musings. Somewhere in my feed, from someone I had never heard of, there appeared the following,\n\n“You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.\nThat’s why every quarter, I evaluate myself and my friends on 3 key criteria:\n\n* Income\n* Fitness\n* Influence\n\nAnyone who scores below me is cut off.\nComplacency is the first step towards mediocrity.”\n\nA day later, though I don’t recall all the details of my reaction, I think it a safe bet it included some combination of a furrowed brow, my best [gas face](https://gfycat.com/decimalreasonableanophelesmosquito) and nausea.  All of that before I fired back with the first thing to come to mind as a counter blow.\n\n“Congratulations on a life devoid of either giving or receiving unconditional love. You’re winning though. 👊”\n\n[https://twitter.com/HAshBrown_27/status/1548437771974348801?s=20&t=4QqD9qeeewCOpN7zYUJ16g](https://twitter.com/HAshBrown_27/status/1548437771974348801?s=20&t=4QqD9qeeewCOpN7zYUJ16g)\n\nSoon after that I turned off my computer and went out for the day. Honestly, I don’t think it occurred to me that I would even look at the tweet again. To the contrary, as someone new to twitter this year, I expected my response would go largely ignored, joining my 20-or-so other tweets in the land of twitter oblivion. To my surprise though, when I returned home several hours later, I noticed my twitter notification bell ringing, alerting me to the fact that my response had close to 200 likes. 20 hours later that number is now up to 488. Not that I’m counting.\n\nI’m new to this twitter thing, and as far as “likes” are concerned, have only facebook likes of posts of my kids, mountain views and fishing pictures to compare it to. 488 likes seems like a lot though. So while it may be small potatoes to seasoned tweeters with big followings, I’m a babe in the woods here, feeling pretty proud of that 488 thank you very much. Ooh, lookie there, just shot past 500. Am I going viral? LFG!!!\n\nSeriously though, upon looking into the phenomena of my most-liked social media entry ever, I see the person I responded to has a lot of followers. 6,075 to be exact. And digging a little deeper I realize he likely intended his tweet as satire. Gas face rescinded. Perhaps the joke is on me for responding to it.\n\nSatire or not, and irrespective of whether his friendship circles have anything to do with crypto and Web3, [@_mihir](https://twitter.com/__mihir?s=20&t=iOpvhasWZtEkPYiiXfkDYw) points to something very concerning to me about Web3 culture and the playing field of web3 identity. Playas gonna play. So how will Web3 define winning?\n\nBefore we get into all that I sense some context would be helpful.  A man in my early 50’s, I am at most a social media dabbler. I have a facebook page that I post on occasionally and to keep up with the lives of my 926 friends. I have created a few blogs over the years that I have enjoyed writing on but never broadcasted. Instagram? Ohhh hellll no….except to check in on the lives of my college-age children. I regard the notion of creating a web “identity” as near hostile to my bias for real-life interaction with others and time outdoors. And other than a short list of physical ailments, I can’t think of anything I’d like less than “followers”.\n\nSo what am I doing here worrying and writing about Web3 culture?  Fair question. What can I say except [orange pills](https://ryanslot.substack.com/p/what-it-means-to-be-orange-pilled#details) are a thing. [Green pills](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylewestaway/2022/06/16/how-crypto-can-regenerate-the-world/?sh=7ed83b602fd3) too. I’ve fallen down a [crypto rabbit hole](https://garywoodfine.com/going-down-the-crypto-rabbit-hole/) and I can’t get up!\n\nThe truth is that while I wrestle with mixed emotions about getting involved, I am thankful for crypto’s role in opening my mind (🤯) and luring me beyond my comfort zone.  For every horror story of greed, theft and exploitation related to this new frontier, I find most of what I read about the space to be inspiring.  To quote the immortal words of Buffalo Springfield, [“Somethings Happening Here”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQUj56sqicU), 2020’s style, and most days I want to be a part of it.\n\nOne example of this is an article, [“The Future of Work”](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-future-of-work), by David Hoffman. David makes a strong case for why Digital Organizations (DO’s), enabled by the blockchain and tokenized incentives, will present unprecedented opportunities for humans to coordinate both our hearts’ and minds’ shared interests to do purposeful work together.  Among the many lines to strike a chord with me David writes,\n\n“If you are a young person, looking for purpose, meaning, and eventually a salary, establishing yourself as a strong DOer is one of the best footholds you can establish for yourself….If you believe DOs are the future, you should start DOing now, so that you become the scarce resource for both DOs and people who need help DOing.”\n\nRelative to the audience David likely had in mind I am not a “young person”. That said, aside from a rather curmudgeonly attitude toward social media, I pride myself at being young in spirit. I am DOing (and DAOing) now and, in time, aspire to be among the scarce, most valued resources of the space. So what game am I playing? And what was it about @_mihir”s tweet that bothered me so?\n\nThough it has been over 20 years since I worked as an equity analyst at an investment brokerage firm, that work, and my short time in the industry, taught me some valuable lessons. The most memorable of them is the difference between the “game” of judging companies’ worth on the basis of quarterly performance vs. that of valuing them (or not) on the basis of fundamental strengths relative to longer-term investment horizons. The former game is played to generate transactions that pay brokers and their firms. The latter is played to maximize investors’ returns.\n\nWeb3 playing fields, DOs and DAOs included, will create whole new worlds from which to relate to the earth, token projects, and one another. There will be more games to go around than anyone can count in the space’s many arenas. Short-term trading, of crypto and people, can be fun, even profitable. Patient investment, in the people and projects that mean the most to us, can change the world. Web3 only wins by changing the world.", "timestamp": 1658287237, "digest": "BHhF8Dl9ohYnhMtphcJCsOiUQVUPJgVVLr0anB-LiAE", "contributor": "0xF64C845aC5b14cf8DD500B3eCD4CC57Cd414c391"}

", "body": "As of July 15, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows that the market has been suffering from “Extreme Fear” for 70 consecutive days, a record high. Although it seems that the market hasn’t been so volatile in July, it remains fundamentally bearish, and the bankruptcy of top institutions did create negative market sentiments. To date, U.S. CPI soared 9.1% over the past year, the largest increase since November 1981, and global finance continues to suffer from a liquidity crunch.\n\nAs the market has just gone through a deleveraging campaign with far-reaching implications, cryptos like BTC and ETH fell below their price peaks recorded during the last market cycle. However, the market has gradually absorbed the panic impact, and there have been signs of a market rebound. According to CoinEx, a crypto exchange, the BTC price recently returned to over $22,000.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wO0DXmTsUAKNaHSAkyGT1.png?height=493&width=1280)\n\nETH, on the other hand, hit $1,500. It should be noted that in the last bear-bull cycle, the market recovery was also driven by increases in the ETH price.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pTfoKMP028yH3ONXF9OmN.png?height=507&width=1280)\n\nAs Bitcoin and Ethereum record consecutive price growths, DeFi tokens have also become more valuable. Does this mean that a new market cycle has started? Let’s take a closer look at the current market in terms of active addresses, the inflow/outflow of money, and market fundamentals. As BTC and ETH led market recoveries during previous cycles, we will examine the relevant statistics of the two.\n\nAccording to on-chain data, Bitcoin’s active addresses increased by 2.44% in the past seven days, and the number of zero balance addresses went up by 5.92%.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qGACWxcZH4ubCgSuSoqnl.png?height=527&width=1280)\n\nEthereum’s active addresses, on the other hand, grew by 9.98% in the past seven days, and the number of zero balance addresses went down by 3.05%. Meanwhile, on July 18, the number of addresses holding at least 1 ETH hit 1,554,716, an all-time high.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xVu3CIbRttcxPnZ3jXvgj.png?height=534&width=1280)\n\nIn terms of the inflow/outflow of money, although both BTC and ETH come with positive inflows, the latter shows stronger momentum.\n\n![Historical In/Out of the Money (BTC)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9B4p_KL-8i1dvFntL68A_.png?height=544&width=1280)\n\n![Historical In/Out of the Money (ETH)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ci0w-pAbJvUOsAgSoHPJa.png?height=585&width=1280)\n\nBased on the current round of price growth, Ethereum has indeed outperformed Bitcoin. It is reported that Bitcoin’s third largest whale has made multiple outgoing transfers since the early morning of July 19. As of this writing, the address has transferred 15,500 bitcoins that are worth about $350 million.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AEqqYQBILotqfncKuiF5N.png?height=172&width=1280)\n\nLet’s now turn to the fundamentals. As global finance faces a liquidity crunch, the crypto market hasn’t been able to stay intact. The market panicked when crypto companies collapsed one after another a while back. However, the deleveraging caused by the liquidity crisis has also optimized the internal capital structure of the market and excluded more hot money. At the same time, new institutional investors are making a push into cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to the information disclosed so far, 40 fundraisings happened last week, and a16z and Sequoia Capital both took action. In particular, the scale of these fundraisings was small, with only three projects raising over $50 million. A report by The Block Research shows that the amount of VC investment in the blockchain space has declined for the first time since Q2 2020. The figure stood at $9.8 billion in Q2 2022, down by approximately 22% compared with the last quarter. Although the market is picking up strength, the fundraising statistics show that institutions remain extremely prudent.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VDDIY_rhEEBTx9wi03K3f.png?height=720&width=1079)\n\nAny industry that seeks growth must go through multiple market cycles. From 2000 to 2002, the dot.com bubble triggered a bear market due to excessive valuations and speculations, but this did not affect its subsequent growth. Today’s crypto market is just the same. The momentary setbacks will help it find better growth drivers in the future.\n\nAs the crypto industry advances, all kinds of new functions and categories have emerged. Meanwhile, the entry threshold has kept going up, which has discouraged many who hope to join the crypto market. While everyone in the crypto space is working on more new functions, one exchange called CoinEx is striving to “slim down” its products. To impress the world with the efforts made by the crypto market, the team is making many complex projects and tools more user-friendly. The exchange intends to make crypto trading easier and welcome investors from all sectors to the crypto space.\n\nToday’s cryptocurrency, like the Internet, exists to make the world a better place.", "timestamp": 1658287917, "digest": "c9MzHbTLPdAKowxyECNZYJWsYZlfmO3rZm-fHpuPQHE", "contributor": "0x159251c5f13184863a9F972d0950d3E032216E8C"}

{"id": "Wv_5Kflvm5-ei8bqW9RsMVwqBAIVoPi3rAm9leptwBI", "title": "Opera Crypto Browser布局iOS", "body": "Opera于4月15日星期五发布了其Web3浏览器的测试版，其中包含内置加密钱包，适用于iOS，iPhone和iPad设备。自一月份以来，Opera的Crypto Browser已适用于Mac和Windows桌面用户以及Android手机用户。在其功能列表中，目前已经可以见到多个与Web3和加密领域密切相关的特性。同时Opera Crypto Browser集成了非托管加密钱包，支持ETH、Polygon和Celo等区块链生态系统，能够在无需第三方应用程序的情况下购买加密货币。\n\n此外该浏览器还能够直接访问去中心化交易平台、基于Web3的NFT、游戏和去中心化应用。其涵盖了超过7000个基于Polygon的服务，用户可像访问Web2上的任何网站一样，无缝体验Web3服务。\n\n在移动设备上发布是Crypto Browser Project的最新步骤，这是一项以Web3为重点的举措，旨在促进分散式应用程序（DApps），游戏和元界平台之间的导航。\n\n根据Opera的说法，这些关键功能包括一个Opera钱包，支持以太坊，多边形和Celo生态系统，用于购买，出售和转移代币。用户还可以将以太坊虚拟机（EVM）兼容的钱包与本机Opera钱包一起恢复，并集成其现有资产和余额。\n\n在浏览器主页上，用户可以查看最新的顶级NFT销售和新闻聚合器，称为“加密角”，其中包含加密资产价格和汽油成本的实时更新，以及空投甚至建议的教育资源。\n\n该公司还表示，该浏览器带有加密货币挖掘保护，可阻止可能损害iPhone或iPad设备性能的“加密劫持”脚本。其他安全功能包括原生广告和跟踪器阻止程序、弹出窗口阻止程序和直观的 Cookie 对话框阻止程序。\n\n根据Cointelegraph援引Opera移动执行副总裁Jorgen Arnesen的说法，Crypto Browser的目标是对Web3的兴趣日益浓厚，无论是资深加密用户还是新手。\n\n“Opera的Crypto Browser项目旨在简化经常使主流用户感到困惑的Web3用户体验。Opera认为Web3必须易于使用，才能充分发挥其潜力并大规模采用。\n\n此外，这家浏览器公司正在增加对八个主要区块链生态系统的支持——比特币、Solana、Polygon、StarkEx、Ronin、Celo、Nervos Network和IXO。Opera表示，他们计划在未来整合更多的权益证明链。\n\n经过上述的描述，我们可以非常轻松的得出一个结论——Opera Crypto Browser是一个Web 3浏览器。可面对这个概念，却还是难免感到一头雾水。究竟什么是Web 3浏览器呢？\n\n## 什么是Web 3浏览器？\n\n如果你在浏览器上查看一个网站，这其实是软件处理各种功能的结果，其本质是从解析网站地址到从网站所在的服务器上提取内容的过程。其底层原理是，浏览器只是一个通往互联网的窗口。这意味着你只需在电脑上存储最低限度的数据并进行最低限度的处理就可以访问网站和应用程序。\n\n而Web3浏览器则超越了这一点，在理想化的情况下，它只是一个空壳，而用户体验所需的所有其他必要工具都是从去中心化的网络中提取的。\n\n区块链基础设施公司Lukso的创始人Fabian Vogelsteller在2015年表示，Elthuny基金会的团队试图构建一个名为Mist的真正的Web3浏览器。它只是一个基于Electron的外壳。\n\n但是这种方法的问题是，它在区块链中运行一个完整的节点，所以当你启动浏览器时，它需要同步所有在你离线时创建的区块数据。而这一过程无疑会拖慢整个进程。作为一个终端用户，很难想象，使用者会为了访问一个网站而愿意忍受漫长的等待。\n\n诸如此类的问题，再加上Electron平台的不安全特性，促使该团队在2019年关闭了该浏览器项目。这就引出了现有浏览器如何处理去中心化网络的问题。\n\n## Web 3浏览器的现代发展\n\n目前，现代浏览器能够处理Web3的应用程序，但用户需要做一些工作才能顺利访问。例如，如果用户使用Chrome浏览器，其就必须安装一个类似于Metamask的去中心化钱包扩展程序来连接到DApps，并修改其DNS设置以访问一些Web3域名。\n\n有一些浏览器提供了某种程度上的原生Web3体验，有内置的钱包和基于Web3的域名支持。例如Opera、Brave等，他们甚至试图简化程序。例如，在设置过程中Opera会要求用户创建一个同其钱包相联系的@opera用户名，这样用户就可以用它来代替42个字符的字符串，在各个应用程序中方便识别自己。\n\n## Web 3浏览器产品分析\n\n一、Opera Crypto Browser\n\nOpera浏览器发布于1996年，其最初并非是区块链浏览器，但在后续改进过程中创新性的添加了区块链钱包，并逐步扩大对区块链技术的适用，时至今日，逐步成为以区块链见长的浏览器。Opera内置Opera钱包，支持ETH、TRX、CBK、Polygon、Celo等区块链网络，具有网页浏览速度快、节约流量等优势。因为其对于数据的消耗相当保守，所以Opera在互联网基础设施较差的环境中很受欢迎。\n\nOpera还旨在提供个性化的网络浏览器。这对某些用户来说似乎很有吸引力，但 个性化的选择意味着在隐私保护方面必然有所舍弃，因为个性化浏览器体验可能需要收集用户的个人信息。不过各取所需，倒也合情合理。\n\n此外，Opera浏览器还提供多种功能，比如提供免费VPN、可恢复EVM钱包、cookie对话框拦截器、加密货币挖矿防护机制、以及原生的广告追踪拦截器等，但用户必须自行设置才能使用。\n\n## 二、Brave浏览器\n\nBrave浏览器是由Brave Software创建的Web浏览器，该应用由Brandon Ike创立。\n\nBrave浏览器拥有快速的网页浏览速度和广告拦截功能。用户可以查看到目前为止已屏蔽了多少广告以及保存了多少数据。\n\n此外，Brave通过提供小部件形式的赞助广告来支持加密货币投资，允许用户购买加密货币并查看市场价格。Brave浏览器正在尝试加强个人信息保护，并支持具有很强匿名性的搜索引擎Tore。此外，Brave为用户免费提供VPN，但目前仅适用于ios，无法在PC和Android上使用。\n\nBrave还为区块链用户提供加密货币钱包。目前支持以太坊网络，整体功能和UI与Metamask类似。但是，Brave浏览器作为广告浏览器受到了很多质疑，特别是其因为在过去输入特定的加密货币交换地址时会自动完成作为推荐地址的设置而受到用户的批评。\n\n此外，Brave还有观看广告可以获得奖励的程序，即以观看Brave提供的广告作为奖励获取方式。如果用户选择观看广告，Brave浏览器将通过推送，间歇性通知用户收看广告。当用户点击推送时，将获得Brave的奖励代币BAT（Basic Attention Token）。但也有不少负面评价认为，与广告曝光频率相比，补偿力度不够。此外，Brave浏览器也存在收集用户的个人信息以有效地提供广告服务的可能性。\n\n## 三、Osiris浏览器\n\nACENT旗下的Osiris浏览器是一个基于区块链的网络浏览器。Osiris浏览器与Opera和Brave的不同之处在于，Osiris浏览器的用户群体是以区块链用户为主的。\n\nOsiris是现有的唯一一款将ETH、BSC、DOT、TRX 和ACE等众多区块链主网集成到一个平台的网络浏览器。\n\n为了提高区块链用户的便利性，项目方在Osiris浏览器内设置了多功能钱包“Metawallet”，该钱包可以使浏览器支持各种加密货币交易。Osiris Meta Wallet的最大缺陷在于只能在Osiris浏览器上使用，其他浏览器目前仍没有可用的扩展程序。就安全性而言Meta Wallet比现有的扩展钱包更加安全，其所支持的区块链网络数量目前来看也是最多的，未来也许将有更多区块链主网加入Osiris浏览器。\n\nOsiris浏览器面向区块链用户，具备基本浏览器的功能，在此基础上其还拥有极为显著的区块链特性。\n\n对于一般的浏览器用户，Osiris浏览器提供了自由选择搜索引擎的选项，同时提供屏蔽广告和增强隐私的Osiris Armor。用户可以使用Osiris Armor设置隐私选项，并查看目前为止已阻止的广告和脚本数量。\n\n此外，Osiris还为区块链用户提供了DApp Store——一个DApp集结的总平台。不得不说，这对区块链用户而言是个相当友好的功能，DApp Store是最适合Osiris浏览器的优化DApp市场，目前也正在快速的拓展全球市场。\n\nOsiris浏览器不同于其他区块链浏览器的最大优势在于，Osiris有自己的主网。\n\n目前，其自主研发的主网已经适用于Osiris浏览器，在全球范围内是首个适用自主研发主网的浏览器。\n\n## Web3浏览器面临的挑战\n\nWeb 3浏览器当今面临的最大挑战之一还是兼容性的问题。换句话来说，用户必须知道其使用的是什么代币，以及一个特定的应用程序在什么区块链协议上运行。\n\n例如，如果用户正在Chrome上使用MetaMask，其可以使用所有基于以太坊的区块链和应用程序。但如果用户需要使用Solana支持的应用程序，那他就需要再另外安装一个Phantom钱包。\n\n除此以外，我们还不得不关心安全问题。在Web3的初期阶段，许多不法分子利用网络钓鱼将用户引诱到欺诈性网站，窃取他们的资产。目前，Opera已经提供了一个带有快捷方式的集中中心，可以方便地引导用户访问合法网站。\n\n根据Vogelsteller的说法，在用户体验Web 3之前面临两大障碍。\n\n首先是需要记住12个字的助记词，并理解这种认证方法背后的安全原因。\n\n其次是需要Ether做任何事情，考虑到加密货币的价格以及涉及的燃料和交易费用等因素，这样的行动逻辑成本未免太高。\n\n浏览器可以通过与不同的合作伙伴合作来解决第一个问题，但第二个问题仍是顽疾。\n\n## Web3浏览器的未来之路\n\n目前，体验Web3对于绝大多数用户仍是一个难题，普通用户需要处理相当陡峭的学习曲线。甚至在Web3体验的起点就是一个42个字符的冗长地址。\n\n这些复杂的代码也使用户难以了解其所有者的声誉和身份。虽然在某些情况下匿名性是很好的，但它也使得这种结构对于信任的建立也无疑设置了极高的壁垒。\n\n除此之外还有一些问题，比如应该在这里使用什么代币、应用程序在哪个区块链上工作、它们是否相互配合等。想象一下，仅仅为了发送一条推特，甚至需要进行十几次的操作。这就是目前Web3的使用感受。\n\n未来，Web3浏览器和通用配置文件等标准无疑是需要协同工作的，也只有这样才能简化这些复杂的流程。彼时，用户也许就不必再担心后端协议的世界了，那里有更容易记住的用户名，以及与每个身份相关的可解析信息。加上区块链本身透明化、不可篡改的特性，无疑会打开新世界的大门。", "timestamp": 1658287911, "digest": "QaZinCG8SI0Ojj6eu41EmjdrpER135D0ZobkekftD_k", "contributor": "0xa1923FB3ff4e7ed8766EC98E61Ac979F59009aFc"}

As of this writing, the address has transferred 15,500 bitcoins that are worth about $350 million.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AEqqYQBILotqfncKuiF5N.png?height=172&width=1280)\n\nLet’s now turn to the fundamentals. As global finance faces a liquidity crunch, the crypto market hasn’t been able to stay intact. The market panicked when crypto companies collapsed one after another a while back. However, the deleveraging caused by the liquidity crisis has also optimized the internal capital structure of the market and excluded more hot money. At the same time, new institutional investors are making a push into cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to the information disclosed so far, 40 fundraisings happened last week, and a16z and Sequoia Capital both took action. In particular, the scale of these fundraisings was small, with only three projects raising over $50 million. A report by The Block Research shows that the amount of VC investment in the blockchain space has declined for the first time since Q2 2020. The figure stood at $9.8 billion in Q2 2022, down by approximately 22% compared with the last quarter. Although the market is picking up strength, the fundraising statistics show that institutions remain extremely prudent.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VDDIY_rhEEBTx9wi03K3f.png?height=720&width=1079)\n\nAny industry that seeks growth must go through multiple market cycles. From 2000 to 2002, the dot.com bubble triggered a bear market due to excessive valuations and speculations, but this did not affect its subsequent growth. Today’s crypto market is just the same. The momentary setbacks will help it find better growth drivers in the future.\n\nAs the crypto industry advances, all kinds of new functions and categories have emerged. Meanwhile, the entry threshold has kept going up, which has discouraged many who hope to join the crypto market. While everyone in the crypto space is working on more new functions, one exchange called CoinEx is striving to “slim down” its products. To impress the world with the efforts made by the crypto market, the team is making many complex projects and tools more user-friendly. The exchange intends to make crypto trading easier and welcome investors from all sectors to the crypto space.\n\nToday’s cryptocurrency, like the Internet, exists to make the world a better place.", "timestamp": 1658287945, "digest": "vTh9DKSGfcBI-mi4xDOtV_qt0bXL2a__NwT2sN2f4nY", "contributor": "0x159251c5f13184863a9F972d0950d3E032216E8C"}

{"id": "PE_3vrcqP_fhtyG4bz7lJ_aSnUOAGyLpjawxAjBvmOM", "title": "X to Earn：对死亡螺旋的正式挑战", "body": "作者：Andy, IOSG Ventures\n\n编辑：Elaine，IOSG Ventures\n\n本文仅做行业学习交流之用，不构成任何投资参考\n\n**写在前面**\n\n自Axie Infinity大火后，类Axie的Play to Earn游戏们雨后春笋般一茬又一茬的冒了出来，然而在Axie给币圈和游戏圈表演了一段精彩的死亡螺旋过山车后，目前还没能出现一款真正能和Axie的精彩故事媲美的P2E游戏：市值不够、热度不够、创意不够，或者单纯的还没做好 😛\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fbGPwW1DscwhrBi0ornWN.png?height=495&width=670)\n\n结果是Axie的P2E不光给其他链游上了一课，同时也给了同样聪明的非链游市场一个灵感：如果Play to Earn能火成这样，那别的X to Earn (X2E)是不是也有机可乘？于是最近两个月市场终于看到了在Axie之后、再一次让我们感受到精彩的X2E产品：**STEPN**。\n\n其他研报复述多次的产品介绍我这里就先一句话概括：**STEPN是一款 Move to Earn游戏，用户购买跑鞋NFT来跑步赚取代币 - 当前STEPN已拥有1百万用户、30万DAU，治理代币市值从IEO的8百万，于不到两个月的时间直达200亿**。\n\n由于此文发布时STEPN依旧属于上升期，很多已经入场或在场外观望、甚至其他X2E的创业者都在密切关注一个问题：STEPN什么时候到达最高点开始进入死亡螺旋？非常能够理解在Ponzinomics (旁氏经济) 下，死亡螺旋是市场不可逃避话题。然而在市场趋向X2E热度继续疯狂发力时，我们不仅不能对死亡螺旋避而不谈，反而更应该主动去了解死亡螺旋代表着什么，挑战如何在死亡螺旋的阴影下将项目做的长久，怎样的运营和理念才能在死亡螺旋的阴影下让用户、项目方与投资者同时最大化长期价值。那么在STEPN当前获取极大热度的时间点、也在更多的X2E产品到来之前，笔者在此文将借用Axie和STEPN的案例，来对死亡螺旋这件事本身提出几个希望对市场有帮助的观点。\n\n## 废话不多说，先上结论：\n\n虽然死亡螺旋对Ponzinomics来说不可避免，但这篇文章想说明以下几点：\n\n* 首先**死亡螺旋的结果不是死亡，更不代表产品的失败，而是从X2E的疯狂回归至产品本身的公允价值的过程**，而这个过程发生前的潜伏期有长有短，发生时的下降速度有快有慢，发生后回归到的公允价值有高有低。\n* Axie作为第一个火的X2E项目经历了很多trial and error，为后面的产品展示出了X2E的可能性、局限性、以及长时间运营下会遇到的挑战，从而让我们看到了如STEPN这样的项目在学习过程中取其精华努力创新 - X2E正在进化。\n* 而我们期待的**X2E的进化，正是更克制的疯狂期、更慢速的退烧期，更高的公允价值回归线**- 这也是我认为STEPN有潜力做到的。\n* 在这之外更重要的是能够最终做到，**让认可项目公允价值本身的用户变为主流，使utility价值投资者而非投机者获取大部分收益。（能够教育市场参与这样的X2E项目不是简单的投10块赚20块，而是投10块不光值了项目本身带来utility的价值，还额外返还了3块；并且对于坚持下去的用户额外奖励，可以达到10块甚至20块返还的可能性。）**\n* 未来的故事中**Ponzinomics之外的经济来源是我对X2E很期待的地方，因为比当前链游的P2E更有故事和空间**：比如最近我们刚聊到一个早期的Bike to Earn的项目（MOTE by Sweetgum Labs，有兴趣的投资人欢迎一起交流）提到了碳排放变现回流经济，那么举个例子的话，一个本来每天开车往返10公里上班的人改为每天骑车，一年可以省下4吨的碳排放，而一吨碳排放在欧洲当前可以价值80欧元，就意味着**理论上一个人一年可以变现300多欧元来回流到经济系统**，而将来碳排价格的提升会让此机制更增加潜力。虽然会有很大的可行性上的挑战（比如碳排交易所是否认可其碳排资质），但X2E产品在向外部经济回流这个方向努力，是我最期待看到的。\n\n**沉默成本与意外回报**\n\n## 一、投资亏损的沉没成本接受度\n\n先从一个例子讲起：健身卡这东西相信大家都不陌生；而办卡后第1个月一周练三次、第10个月三周练一次的故事估计大概率也不陌生；最后如果你这张卡过期后一段时间重燃斗志、又走了一遍如上的循环，那你我就是一家人了。为什么我们允许自己一次又一次的投入不小的成本，但又反反复复投降于低自制力，让这样的循环一直在发生？一次循环没成功的人，是不是又像忘了教训一样发誓“下次一定”，重新再踏上这条路呢？\n\n一个关键的心态是**对沉没成本的宽容度**：办卡本是对自己体型和健康（**utility**）的投资，而过了兴奋期后健身卡上的蜘蛛网则是意志力宣布这份投资失败、以及对成本沉默的和解。\n\n听起来可能没什么感觉，那我们粗略量化一下：5000多人民币的健身年卡本来的购买目的为督促你一周跑3次每次5公里，而你最终只坚持了前两个月，那么本来购买时认可的5000块的投资回报为13公斤，最后回报为2.3公斤，为原本ROI的15% → 大部分人看到这里的反应大概率是”对不起，下次还敢“，然后再办卡。然而试想如果这是各位投资股市、区块链的ROI，还会继续”下次还敢“吗？**同为投资亏损，很容易看出大家对财务投资的沉没成本宽容度低，而与之相比，对utility（体型/健康/快乐等）投资的沉没成本宽容度高了太多**。\n\n## 二、STEPN：到底是你的财务投资软件还是utility投资（健身）软件？\n\n**STEPN投资者的意外回报**：举一个很多Stepn玩家可能多少都会有共鸣的例子：一个体验过Axie的朋友差不多一个月前入场，本来入场目的和当初玩axie一样都是赚钱，再额外加上跑步的形式比游戏更少费脑子，且少了“玩游戏浪费时间”这样的阻力，所以在同样的时间成本下选择了Stepn；但随着这一个月每天为了赚GST按时下楼跑步，发现了Stepn带给自己的意义和自己当初的预期有了变化：本来最重视的是多久回本，平均每天跑一次能让我赚多少钱（财务回报），但后来居然被之前没怎么在意的财务之外的回报震撼到：每天运动40分钟带来的精神状态的改变，对下班后懒惰宅家的改变，开始与身边家人一起出门运动的改变，减肥失败多年但这次居然一月瘦两斤的改变，对自己身体健康更加在意的改变。\n\n对这个朋友来说，Stepn本就是一个跑步+赚钱项目，用户当然在入场时自然会对两边都有所期待，但微观下的参与过程还多了一个关键的心态变化：从抱着财务收益最佳的目的来，但**经过了长时间的坚持发生了心态变化，认可并感激了STEPN给他带来了财务回报之外的收益，也就是utility上的收益。而这恰恰是Axie Infinity缺失的。我们都说Ponzigames（旁氏游戏）的结局都是死亡螺旋、曲终人散，但上述STEPN多出来的这份心态转变，或许会成为一个改写结果重要因素。**\n\n**不可避免的死亡螺旋，不代表死亡**\n\n## 一、首先定义三类玩家：\n\n**幸运的A类玩家、担忧的B类玩家和观望的C类玩家**：上文例子中提到的那位朋友是一个月前进入的，此时即将回本 - 我们不妨将这类已回本（或即将顺利回本）的玩家称为**幸运的A类玩家**- 由于游戏的机制没有给鞋设定生命周期，那么A类玩家回本后只要愿意坚持则会永远赚下去。那么在看完A类回本用户后，作为Ponzinomic（旁氏经济学）类产品的两个灵魂问题来了：\n\n1）买鞋不久还没回本的人还能不能/多久回本？这类玩家我们暂且叫做**担忧的B类玩家。**\n\n2）还没入场买鞋但在观望的朋友到底还能不能入场？这类玩家我们暂且叫做**观望的C类玩家。**\n\n这里澄清一下这里的A、B、C类玩家不是固定的用户，而是一个时间节点下的用户群分类，对于个人来说是可转化的：B类玩家花了一定时间回本后会成为A类，而C类入场后又会变成B类。\n\n## 二、STEPN的死亡螺旋，会和Axie Infinity有何区别？\n\n无法辩解的一点是Ponzinomics的确避免不了死亡螺旋，但我认为同是死亡螺旋，STEPN和Axie的经历和结果将有3个有意思的区别（again非投资建议）：**1）STEPN的死亡螺旋潜伏期可能更长；2）STEPN的死亡螺旋的连锁反应速度可能更缓慢；3）STEPN的死亡螺旋后的平缓期或许有更大前景**。下面我们来具体讨论。\n\n### 1）STEPN的死亡螺旋潜伏期可能更长（警告！理论分析非投资建议）：\n\n* **Axie：**\n\n**a. 拥抱了公会的Axie经历了疯狂的非自然增长**- 玩家中只有15%为个人用户，85%为不需要拥有Axie即可参与SLP产出的公会用户。公会提供了手把手级别的教程拉新人加入，通过较短的时间可以让玩家快速上手开始打金，由公会管理来直接安排最优的yield策略让大量快速加入的公会玩家产出最大量级的SLP。\n\n**b. 大量的公会和雇佣兵保持了远大于自然玩家对经济系统的榨取效率**：这时的公会玩家不属于前文STEPN分析中提到的A、B、C类玩家，而是单纯的雇佣兵，用来最大化榨取Axie infinity的福利，而这样的榨取效率是比同样数量的自然增长的个人玩家高出许多。快速的榨取速度让公会和雇佣兵们尝到甜头继续扩张，而享受着快速增长的sky mavis并没有对这样的高效价值榨取有过多的干预，或者说公会的势头 (momentum) 已经不允许sky mavis踩刹车，所以高效率的价值榨取与高速的非自然增长代表着更短的Ponzi产品生命周期，最终我们看到的是从21年7月初开始发力的AXS，在4个月后的11月初来到了自己的最高点，正式进入死亡螺旋。\n\n**c. 而公会和雇佣兵或许是Axie必须吞下的慢性毒药**：如果当初没有公会呢？Axie是否能靠自然增长将那4个月的时间拉长到6个月？甚至10个月？或者说如果没有工会，那么Axie是否因为增长不够快而吸引不了新鲜血液，导致会更早的戛然而止？我没有一个确切的结论，但我偏向相信Axie是无法依靠自然增长的，只能吞下公会这颗救命毒药 - 传统的游戏玩家遇到这样干燥简单的游戏，是不太愿意主动花高价钱进场肝着受罪的，而菲律宾等发展中国家少了公会的帮助，复杂的加密代币系统天然的屏障会让大量较低学习能力、经济能力的用户敬而远之，所以公会是Axie近乎必然的选择，可能明明知道可能带来对经济的后果，但依然是必须吞下的慢性毒药。\n\n* **STEPN：**\n\n**a. 坚决保持自然增长，打击作弊、拒绝公会、没有租赁**：作此文时官方刚刚宣布达到300K的DAU，于Axie很大的区别在于这300K DAU基本都是实实在在的“一人一机一号”的真实玩家 - 没有工会、没有租赁，需要入场需要自己学习如何使用加密代币，需要从自己的腰包里掏钱，很难作弊 - 在STEPN官方多重的严格监控和打击下极难实现非自然增长。Jerry和Yawn两位创始人在多次分享中表达过对自然增长的坚持，且唯一白皮书中于非自然增长相关的租赁功能，Jerry在我专门的提问中也确认过仅会在很后面开，且确认半年内不会上。\n\n**b.项目方对代币经济的运营也非常克制：**STEPN的邀请码机制一定程度缓解了进场速度过快，推出的宝石和开箱玩法在愈加努力地消耗着GST，近期给治理代币GMT增加了的需求点也是在间接分担GST的压力，且未来也会给GMT更多功能。可以看到游戏背景的项目方在传统游戏与P2E案例中借鉴和创新了多个方法来努力维持代币经济的稳定，来尽可能延长Axie走短的路。\n\n**c.有钱、爱学习的真实玩家，和破圈带来的高质量圈外新玩家**：这样的坚持和克制导致带来的用户群体是经过经过两层筛选的：有钱（入场费的确不便宜，而且都要自掏腰包），有学习能力/知识（STEPN软件里没有冗长的新用户玩法介绍，需要玩家自己学习去搞清楚钱包的用法和逻辑 - Jerry提到问卷调查显示有30%的用户是第一次使用去中心化钱包）。\n\n**d. 如果项目方想，随时可以选择打开非自然增长的阀门来延缓死亡螺旋的到来（虽然短期内不会）**：虽然我们肉眼看到了快速增长的用户数据，但这样的数据已经是项目方克制的情况下增长的真实用户，对经济系统的价值萃取效率远远比不过Axie公会就算慢慢到了后期开始增长乏力，如果STEPN想要打开阀门降低用户筛选门槛，我相信后期靠非自然增长也可以一定程度上继续推迟死亡螺旋的开始的。\n\n### 2）STEPN的死亡螺旋的连锁反应速度可能更缓慢：\n\n* **Axie：**\n\n  **a.死亡螺旋虽然是连锁反应，Axie的下降快非断崖式下跌**：其实当我们看AXS在死亡螺旋开始后的市值，虽为连锁反应，也并非断崖式的下跌。原本的回本速度在下跌中被拉长，但如果用户愿意是依然可以坚持肝 (grind) 慢慢回本的，不过这是一个痛苦的过程，因为游戏本身的可享受游玩 (enjoyable gamplay) 时长是有限的，而后期为了财务回报慢慢回收成本则是折磨和煎熬。\n\n  **b.由于资产提供不了太多财务投资之外的意义 (utility)，抛售是简单明确的选择**：对于大部分用户来说，除了打金属性之外，游戏意义并不大，换句话说如果你作为一个真实用户真的投了自己的钱去玩Axie，除了回本目的以外，游戏本身带来的享受/utility过低，导致你在死亡螺旋进行时只剩下财务投资回报降低的懊恼，那么最理性的做法就是早点跑路走人，且你会大概率选择此理性的做法。因为游戏中有很多个跟你一样想法的人，这也是死亡螺旋导致的崩盘速度虽然不会断崖，但也不会是缓坡。\n* **STEPN：**\n\n**a. 用户在参与过程中对财务回报之外的utility回报的认可**：回顾文章一开始我那位朋友的故事 - 主要因为财务投资的目的参与STEPN，但过程中逐渐意识到了utility（体型/健康/快乐）方面的投资回报。那再回到我文章最开始提到的部分：同为投资亏损，很容易看出大家在现实生活中对财务投资的沉没成本宽容度低，而与之相比，对utility（体型/健康/快乐等）投资的沉没成本宽容度高了许多 - 那么在STEPN的场景下，这种多出来的宽容有什么样的体现呢？下面我们具体分析：\n\n**b. 与Axie不一样在于，STEPN给了一部分认可utility回报的用户一个不抛售的选择**：所以一个关键的问题就来了：假设你在死亡螺旋开始的最顶点投入了1000美元进去，坚持每天跑了一个月发现之前50天回本的目标拉长到了一年甚至更久，但突然发现自己获得了那么多财务回报之外的utility回报，你会怎么做？\n\n1. 赶紧卖掉所有财产止损，回归每天宅家不运动的懒惰生活？\n   * 肯定自己这段时间的坚持和utility回报、意识到回本的愿望慢慢从一个投资期待摇身一变成了帮自己坚持下去的承诺，从而决定不抛售/少抛售，并把本来两个月的回本战线拉满一年甚至更多、慢慢把成本跑回来？\n\n**或者说只要你愿意留下坚持运动，你就能越来越健康、就能迟早回本、迟早开始净赚；而选择抛售会让你有直接财务损失，且没有了外界的推动力而慢慢放弃一个非常好的生活习惯。**我觉得你看到这个问题已经开始考虑自己的选择，而非像上文中Axie用户的选择一样单一快速的话，那STEPN死亡螺旋时的下跌就可能就会比Axie更缓慢。\n\n**c. 问卷显示有83%的用户期待自己在死亡螺旋中不跑路**：我们再看一个例子，是我在STEPN reddit上的发的一个用户调研（如下图）：当STEPN进入像Axie一样的死亡螺旋后，你会对你的财产做什么？我本来的期待是大部分人会选择卖掉所有财产离开，但最终结果确是60%选择了基本不会卖GMT和鞋且准备继续跑下去，23%选择了会留下关键的鞋（比如1灰、或1绿8灰），而只有17%的人选择了全部变卖：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K8_kmNH3IaQn_HDVw_Sxi.png?height=301&width=916)\n\n这套问卷当然没有法律效应，所以虽然最终价格开始下跌时，现在说不卖的到时候可能还是会卖，但我相信这样的调研结果绝不是在Axie那边可以看到的。也就是说我认为死亡螺旋开始后的变卖压力有较高概率会比Axie低，下降坡度会更缓慢，回本周期受到的负面影响与普通链游相比更小，因为一部分用户在参与过程中会向utility投入做出一定转变，导致对原本投资回报敏感度降低，而更focus在utility的回报。\n\n### 3）STEPN的死亡螺旋后的平缓期或许有更大前景：\n\n* **Axie：**\n\n  **a. 死亡螺旋的结果不是死亡，而是慢慢显露出产品对市场的公允价值 (fair value)**：经历过死亡螺旋的大幅下跌后，现在AXS的市值已经稳定在3 billion的平缓期近三个月了，Axie的价格降低到更多人较易获取 (accessible) 的50美元左右一只。这时入场的投入门槛低，但回本周期依然长，不过因为游戏本身带给玩家的utility回报（游戏乐趣）有限，以回本和净赚为目标的玩家依旧会感受到折磨。而且对于总玩家中那85%的公会雇佣兵来说，Axie的产出 (yield) 已经低过了现实中的工作，参与率下降，反而之前有兴趣尝试Axie但嫌门票贵的真正的玩家，也就是”**观望的C类玩家**“们有机会进来尝试，意味着死亡螺旋让Axie过了快速膨胀宣传期、终于有了欢迎真实玩家入场的机会。回本周期拉长的公会和收入降低的雇佣兵们不开心，但死亡螺旋引起的下跌还是给最需要享受其游戏乐趣的广大真实玩家带来了机会。我和一起看游戏的同事Alex都认为P2E不是目的，而是获客方式（UA）- Axie的故事以不成熟方式间接印证了这一理论：P2E的狂欢让Axie省去了冷启动买量的步骤，得以早期快速获得大量资金、用户以及打磨产品的机会，经历死亡螺旋后入场门槛恢复到了游戏自身的公允价值 (fair value)，由真正为了玩这款游戏的玩家（而非投机者）来参与以及取代。\n* **STEPN：**\n\n**a. STEPN死亡螺旋后也会稳定在比Axie更高的平缓期价值，且会有比当前更多的用户和更大的市场**：当最便宜的灰鞋价格从1000刀下降到比如100刀时，虽然回本周期很长（比如一年），坚持不下去的玩家的投入就变成了沉没成本来pay坚持下去的玩家，但只要你坚持下去，系统就会奖励你回本，因为当投入从1000刀降低到100刀时，玩家会对自己的沉没成本更加宽容，导致无法坚持下去的人更多，沉没成本收集的更多，这时会形成一个比较稳定的balance，于上文中AXS当前稳定下来的价格类似。这时STEPN已经从一个赚钱项目摇身一变成了一款对赌协议：花100刀买一个监督自己坚持跑步的项目，当你坚持下去不光可以回收那100刀，甚至可以继续稳定的赚钱，how does that sound？\n\n**b. 仿盘可以撑的了一时但成不了一事，不会影响STEPN的长期价值**：那么聪明的小伙伴们可能就要问了，那我作为玩家到时候找个仿盘继续跑能赚的更多，为什么要继续在STEPN上呆着？我觉得这方面可以看看Axie：仿盘数量谁也比不上Axie，那Axie的仿盘都是什么样的结果？虽然有人能赚到钱，但它们周期更短，市值更小，且对真正赚钱的玩家要求不是一般的高：要深刻学习到有哪些高产出 (yield) 的项目、谁在做盘、是否进的够早、什么时候得跑 - 的确到时候会有一波对财务投资回报敏感的STEPN的用户去仿盘尝试赚钱，但终究仿盘们会die down，会让这些人受伤后、带着运动的习惯，重新回归到经过时间证明的、yield较低但稳定的STEPN；而这只是财务投资回报敏感的用户，那么更偏重utility投资回报的用户是不太愿意花如此多精力时间冒仿盘的险，而这也是STEPN用户和Axie用户的最大区别 - Axie的公会玩家可是需要用这笔钱过日子的，怎么能不用最大努力来最大化回报？再加上STEPN后面的社交属性和其他叙事 (narrative)、以及依靠自己最大体量发育起来旁氏经济之外的资源和资金流入能力（比如电商、碳排放、品牌合作等）以及创始人们的叙事 (narrative) 能力、用户的真实度和高质量，我相信STEPN或许可以成为一个比Axie更能站到最后的品牌。\n\n**总结**\n\n虽然死亡螺旋对Ponzinomics来说不可避免，但我写这篇文章的目的是想说明以下几点：\n\n1. 首先死亡螺旋的结果不是死亡，更不代表产品的失败，而是从X2E的疯狂回归至产品本身的公允价值的过程，而这个过程发生前的潜伏期有长有短，发生时的下降速度有快有慢，发生后回归到的公允价值有高有低。\n   * Axie作为第一个火的XXX赚钱项目 (或者叫X2E) 经历了很多trial and error，为后面的产品展示出了X2E的可能性、局限性、以及长时间运营下会遇到的挑战，从而让我们看到了如STEPN这样的项目在学习过程中取其精华努力创新 - X2E正在进化。\n   * 而我们期待的**X2E的进化，正是更克制的疯狂期、更慢速的退烧期，更高的公允价值回归线**- 这也是我认为STEPN有潜力做到的。\n   * 在这之外更重要的是能够最终做到，**让认可项目公允价值本身的用户变为主流，使utility价值投资者而非投机者获取大部分收益。（认可参与这样的项目不是简单的投10块赚20块，而是投10块不光值了项目本身带来utility的价值，还额外返还了3块；并且对于坚持下去的用户额外奖励，可以达到10块甚至20块返还的可能性。）**\n   * 未来的故事中Ponzinomics之外的经济来源是我对X2E很期待的地方，因为比当前链游的P2E更有故事和空间：比如最近我刚聊到一个Bike to Earn的项目（MOTE by Sweetgum Labs，有兴趣的投资人欢迎一起交流）提到了碳排放变现回流经济，那么举个例子的话，一个本来每天开车往返10公里上班的人改为每天骑车，一年可以省下4吨的碳排放，而一吨碳排放在欧洲当前可以价值80欧元，就意味着**一个人一年可以变现300多欧元来回流到经济系统**，而将来碳价的提升会让此机制更增加潜力。虽然肯定会有很多操作和价格上的挑战，但X2E产品在向外部经济回流这个方向努力，是我非常期待看到的。\n\n**写在最后**\n\n说了这么多我认为STEPN比Axie具有优势的地方，再强调一遍这并非投资建议，因为项目的运营除了基本面以外，很大程度上取决于掌权者和大户参与者 - STEPN能第一时间让三大交易所合作，以及whale拉盘时的慷慨都展示了很多STEPN在基本面之外的一些实力。最终STEPN的发展方向终归还是取决于项目里各种重要要素之间的利弊平衡以及动荡不安的市场。以上的分析是基于目前得到的各方面信息推测STEPN后面可能经历的一些节点和潜力，最终如何，就让我们拭目以待。", "timestamp": 1658288757, "digest": "8cY5OlN-4LnTjiCe3u1vwOkLpZIcpkervvi1V9U-pAA", "contributor": "0xa1923FB3ff4e7ed8766EC98E61Ac979F59009aFc"}

当前STEPN已拥有1百万用户、30万DAU，治理代币市值从IEO的8百万，于不到两个月的时间直达200亿**。\n\n由于此文发布时STEPN依旧属于上升期，很多已经入场或在场外观望、甚至其他X2E的创业者都在密切关注一个问题：STEPN什么时候到达最高点开始进入死亡螺旋？非常能够理解在Ponzinomics (旁氏经济) 下，死亡螺旋是市场不可逃避话题。然而在市场趋向X2E热度继续疯狂发力时，我们不仅不能对死亡螺旋避而不谈，反而更应该主动去了解死亡螺旋代表着什么，挑战如何在死亡螺旋的阴影下将项目做的长久，怎样的运营和理念才能在死亡螺旋的阴影下让用户、项目方与投资者同时最大化长期价值。那么在STEPN当前获取极大热度的时间点、也在更多的X2E产品到来之前，笔者在此文将借用Axie和STEPN的案例，来对死亡螺旋这件事本身提出几个希望对市场有帮助的观点。\n\n## 废话不多说，先上结论：\n\n虽然死亡螺旋对Ponzinomics来说不可避免，但这篇文章想说明以下几点：\n\n* 首先**死亡螺旋的结果不是死亡，更不代表产品的失败，而是从X2E的疯狂回归至产品本身的公允价值的过程**，而这个过程发生前的潜伏期有长有短，发生时的下降速度有快有慢，发生后回归到的公允价值有高有低。\n* Axie作为第一个火的X2E项目经历了很多trial and error，为后面的产品展示出了X2E的可能性、局限性、以及长时间运营下会遇到的挑战，从而让我们看到了如STEPN这样的项目在学习过程中取其精华努力创新 - X2E正在进化。\n* 而我们期待的**X2E的进化，正是更克制的疯狂期、更慢速的退烧期，更高的公允价值回归线**- 这也是我认为STEPN有潜力做到的。\n* 在这之外更重要的是能够最终做到，**让认可项目公允价值本身的用户变为主流，使utility价值投资者而非投机者获取大部分收益。（能够教育市场参与这样的X2E项目不是简单的投10块赚20块，而是投10块不光值了项目本身带来utility的价值，还额外返还了3块；并且对于坚持下去的用户额外奖励，可以达到10块甚至20块返还的可能性。）**\n* 未来的故事中**Ponzinomics之外的经济来源是我对X2E很期待的地方，因为比当前链游的P2E更有故事和空间**：比如最近我们刚聊到一个早期的Bike to Earn的项目（MOTE by Sweetgum Labs，有兴趣的投资人欢迎一起交流）提到了碳排放变现回流经济，那么举个例子的话，一个本来每天开车往返10公里上班的人改为每天骑车，一年可以省下4吨的碳排放，而一吨碳排放在欧洲当前可以价值80欧元，就意味着**理论上一个人一年可以变现300多欧元来回流到经济系统**，而将来碳排价格的提升会让此机制更增加潜力。虽然会有很大的可行性上的挑战（比如碳排交易所是否认可其碳排资质），但X2E产品在向外部经济回流这个方向努力，是我最期待看到的。\n\n**沉默成本与意外回报**\n\n## 一、投资亏损的沉没成本接受度\n\n先从一个例子讲起：健身卡这东西相信大家都不陌生；而办卡后第1个月一周练三次、第10个月三周练一次的故事估计大概率也不陌生；最后如果你这张卡过期后一段时间重燃斗志、又走了一遍如上的循环，那你我就是一家人了。为什么我们允许自己一次又一次的投入不小的成本，但又反反复复投降于低自制力，让这样的循环一直在发生？一次循环没成功的人，是不是又像忘了教训一样发誓“下次一定”，重新再踏上这条路呢？\n\n一个关键的心态是**对沉没成本的宽容度**：办卡本是对自己体型和健康（**utility**）的投资，而过了兴奋期后健身卡上的蜘蛛网则是意志力宣布这份投资失败、以及对成本沉默的和解。\n\n听起来可能没什么感觉，那我们粗略量化一下：5000多人民币的健身年卡本来的购买目的为督促你一周跑3次每次5公里，而你最终只坚持了前两个月，那么本来购买时认可的5000块的投资回报为13公斤，最后回报为2.3公斤，为原本ROI的15% → 大部分人看到这里的反应大概率是”对不起，下次还敢“，然后再办卡。然而试想如果这是各位投资股市、区块链的ROI，还会继续”下次还敢“吗？**同为投资亏损，很容易看出大家对财务投资的沉没成本宽容度低，而与之相比，对utility（体型/健康/快乐等）投资的沉没成本宽容度高了太多**。\n\n## 二、STEPN：到底是你的财务投资软件还是utility投资（健身）软件？\n\n**STEPN投资者的意外回报**：举一个很多Stepn玩家可能多少都会有共鸣的例子：一个体验过Axie的朋友差不多一个月前入场，本来入场目的和当初玩axie一样都是赚钱，再额外加上跑步的形式比游戏更少费脑子，且少了“玩游戏浪费时间”这样的阻力，所以在同样的时间成本下选择了Stepn；但随着这一个月每天为了赚GST按时下楼跑步，发现了Stepn带给自己的意义和自己当初的预期有了变化：本来最重视的是多久回本，平均每天跑一次能让我赚多少钱（财务回报），但后来居然被之前没怎么在意的财务之外的回报震撼到：每天运动40分钟带来的精神状态的改变，对下班后懒惰宅家的改变，开始与身边家人一起出门运动的改变，减肥失败多年但这次居然一月瘦两斤的改变，对自己身体健康更加在意的改变。\n\n对这个朋友来说，Stepn本就是一个跑步+赚钱项目，用户当然在入场时自然会对两边都有所期待，但微观下的参与过程还多了一个关键的心态变化：从抱着财务收益最佳的目的来，但**经过了长时间的坚持发生了心态变化，认可并感激了STEPN给他带来了财务回报之外的收益，也就是utility上的收益。而这恰恰是Axie Infinity缺失的。我们都说Ponzigames（旁氏游戏）的结局都是死亡螺旋、曲终人散，但上述STEPN多出来的这份心态转变，或许会成为一个改写结果重要因素。**\n\n**不可避免的死亡螺旋，不代表死亡**\n\n## 一、首先定义三类玩家：\n\n**幸运的A类玩家、担忧的B类玩家和观望的C类玩家**：上文例子中提到的那位朋友是一个月前进入的，此时即将回本 - 我们不妨将这类已回本（或即将顺利回本）的玩家称为**幸运的A类玩家**- 由于游戏的机制没有给鞋设定生命周期，那么A类玩家回本后只要愿意坚持则会永远赚下去。那么在看完A类回本用户后，作为Ponzinomic（旁氏经济学）类产品的两个灵魂问题来了：\n\n1）买鞋不久还没回本的人还能不能/多久回本？这类玩家我们暂且叫做**担忧的B类玩家。**\n\n2）还没入场买鞋但在观望的朋友到底还能不能入场？这类玩家我们暂且叫做**观望的C类玩家。**\n\n这里澄清一下这里的A、B、C类玩家不是固定的用户，而是一个时间节点下的用户群分类，对于个人来说是可转化的：B类玩家花了一定时间回本后会成为A类，而C类入场后又会变成B类。\n\n## 二、STEPN的死亡螺旋，会和Axie Infinity有何区别？\n\n无法辩解的一点是Ponzinomics的确避免不了死亡螺旋，但我认为同是死亡螺旋，STEPN和Axie的经历和结果将有3个有意思的区别（again非投资建议）：**1）STEPN的死亡螺旋潜伏期可能更长；2）STEPN的死亡螺旋的连锁反应速度可能更缓慢；3）STEPN的死亡螺旋后的平缓期或许有更大前景**。下面我们来具体讨论。\n\n### 1）STEPN的死亡螺旋潜伏期可能更长（警告！理论分析非投资建议）：\n\n* **Axie：**\n\n**a. 拥抱了公会的Axie经历了疯狂的非自然增长**- 玩家中只有15%为个人用户，85%为不需要拥有Axie即可参与SLP产出的公会用户。公会提供了手把手级别的教程拉新人加入，通过较短的时间可以让玩家快速上手开始打金，由公会管理来直接安排最优的yield策略让大量快速加入的公会玩家产出最大量级的SLP。\n\n**b. 大量的公会和雇佣兵保持了远大于自然玩家对经济系统的榨取效率**：这时的公会玩家不属于前文STEPN分析中提到的A、B、C类玩家，而是单纯的雇佣兵，用来最大化榨取Axie infinity的福利，而这样的榨取效率是比同样数量的自然增长的个人玩家高出许多。快速的榨取速度让公会和雇佣兵们尝到甜头继续扩张，而享受着快速增长的sky mavis并没有对这样的高效价值榨取有过多的干预，或者说公会的势头 (momentum) 已经不允许sky mavis踩刹车，所以高效率的价值榨取与高速的非自然增长代表着更短的Ponzi产品生命周期，最终我们看到的是从21年7月初开始发力的AXS，在4个月后的11月初来到了自己的最高点，正式进入死亡螺旋。\n\n**c. 而公会和雇佣兵或许是Axie必须吞下的慢性毒药**：如果当初没有公会呢？Axie是否能靠自然增长将那4个月的时间拉长到6个月？甚至10个月？或者说如果没有工会，那么Axie是否因为增长不够快而吸引不了新鲜血液，导致会更早的戛然而止？我没有一个确切的结论，但我偏向相信Axie是无法依靠自然增长的，只能吞下公会这颗救命毒药 - 传统的游戏玩家遇到这样干燥简单的游戏，是不太愿意主动花高价钱进场肝着受罪的，而菲律宾等发展中国家少了公会的帮助，复杂的加密代币系统天然的屏障会让大量较低学习能力、经济能力的用户敬而远之，所以公会是Axie近乎必然的选择，可能明明知道可能带来对经济的后果，但依然是必须吞下的慢性毒药。\n\n* **STEPN：**\n\n**a. 坚决保持自然增长，打击作弊、拒绝公会、没有租赁**：作此文时官方刚刚宣布达到300K的DAU，于Axie很大的区别在于这300K DAU基本都是实实在在的“一人一机一号”的真实玩家 - 没有工会、没有租赁，需要入场需要自己学习如何使用加密代币，需要从自己的腰包里掏钱，很难作弊 - 在STEPN官方多重的严格监控和打击下极难实现非自然增长。Jerry和Yawn两位创始人在多次分享中表达过对自然增长的坚持，且唯一白皮书中于非自然增长相关的租赁功能，Jerry在我专门的提问中也确认过仅会在很后面开，且确认半年内不会上。\n\n**b.项目方对代币经济的运营也非常克制：**STEPN的邀请码机制一定程度缓解了进场速度过快，推出的宝石和开箱玩法在愈加努力地消耗着GST，近期给治理代币GMT增加了的需求点也是在间接分担GST的压力，且未来也会给GMT更多功能。可以看到游戏背景的项目方在传统游戏与P2E案例中借鉴和创新了多个方法来努力维持代币经济的稳定，来尽可能延长Axie走短的路。\n\n**c.有钱、爱学习的真实玩家，和破圈带来的高质量圈外新玩家**：这样的坚持和克制导致带来的用户群体是经过经过两层筛选的：有钱（入场费的确不便宜，而且都要自掏腰包），有学习能力/知识（STEPN软件里没有冗长的新用户玩法介绍，需要玩家自己学习去搞清楚钱包的用法和逻辑 - Jerry提到问卷调查显示有30%的用户是第一次使用去中心化钱包）。\n\n**d. 如果项目方想，随时可以选择打开非自然增长的阀门来延缓死亡螺旋的到来（虽然短期内不会）**：虽然我们肉眼看到了快速增长的用户数据，但这样的数据已经是项目方克制的情况下增长的真实用户，对经济系统的价值萃取效率远远比不过Axie公会就算慢慢到了后期开始增长乏力，如果STEPN想要打开阀门降低用户筛选门槛，我相信后期靠非自然增长也可以一定程度上继续推迟死亡螺旋的开始的。\n\n### 2）STEPN的死亡螺旋的连锁反应速度可能更缓慢：\n\n* **Axie：**\n\n  **a.死亡螺旋虽然是连锁反应，Axie的下降快非断崖式下跌**：其实当我们看AXS在死亡螺旋开始后的市值，虽为连锁反应，也并非断崖式的下跌。原本的回本速度在下跌中被拉长，但如果用户愿意是依然可以坚持肝 (grind) 慢慢回本的，不过这是一个痛苦的过程，因为游戏本身的可享受游玩 (enjoyable gamplay) 时长是有限的，而后期为了财务回报慢慢回收成本则是折磨和煎熬。\n\n  **b.由于资产提供不了太多财务投资之外的意义 (utility)，抛售是简单明确的选择**：对于大部分用户来说，除了打金属性之外，游戏意义并不大，换句话说如果你作为一个真实用户真的投了自己的钱去玩Axie，除了回本目的以外，游戏本身带来的享受/utility过低，导致你在死亡螺旋进行时只剩下财务投资回报降低的懊恼，那么最理性的做法就是早点跑路走人，且你会大概率选择此理性的做法。因为游戏中有很多个跟你一样想法的人，这也是死亡螺旋导致的崩盘速度虽然不会断崖，但也不会是缓坡。\n* **STEPN：**\n\n**a. 用户在参与过程中对财务回报之外的utility回报的认可**：回顾文章一开始我那位朋友的故事 - 主要因为财务投资的目的参与STEPN，但过程中逐渐意识到了utility（体型/健康/快乐）方面的投资回报。那再回到我文章最开始提到的部分：同为投资亏损，很容易看出大家在现实生活中对财务投资的沉没成本宽容度低，而与之相比，对utility（体型/健康/快乐等）投资的沉没成本宽容度高了许多 - 那么在STEPN的场景下，这种多出来的宽容有什么样的体现呢？下面我们具体分析：\n\n**b. 与Axie不一样在于，STEPN给了一部分认可utility回报的用户一个不抛售的选择**：所以一个关键的问题就来了：假设你在死亡螺旋开始的最顶点投入了1000美元进去，坚持每天跑了一个月发现之前50天回本的目标拉长到了一年甚至更久，但突然发现自己获得了那么多财务回报之外的utility回报，你会怎么做？\n\n1. 赶紧卖掉所有财产止损，回归每天宅家不运动的懒惰生活？\n   * 肯定自己这段时间的坚持和utility回报、意识到回本的愿望慢慢从一个投资期待摇身一变成了帮自己坚持下去的承诺，从而决定不抛售/少抛售，并把本来两个月的回本战线拉满一年甚至更多、慢慢把成本跑回来？\n\n**或者说只要你愿意留下坚持运动，你就能越来越健康、就能迟早回本、迟早开始净赚；而选择抛售会让你有直接财务损失，且没有了外界的推动力而慢慢放弃一个非常好的生活习惯。**我觉得你看到这个问题已经开始考虑自己的选择，而非像上文中Axie用户的选择一样单一快速的话，那STEPN死亡螺旋时的下跌就可能就会比Axie更缓慢。\n\n**c. 问卷显示有83%的用户期待自己在死亡螺旋中不跑路**：我们再看一个例子，是我在STEPN reddit上的发的一个用户调研（如下图）：当STEPN进入像Axie一样的死亡螺旋后，你会对你的财产做什么？我本来的期待是大部分人会选择卖掉所有财产离开，但最终结果确是60%选择了基本不会卖GMT和鞋且准备继续跑下去，23%选择了会留下关键的鞋（比如1灰、或1绿8灰），而只有17%的人选择了全部变卖：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K8_kmNH3IaQn_HDVw_Sxi.png?height=301&width=916)\n\n这套问卷当然没有法律效应，所以虽然最终价格开始下跌时，现在说不卖的到时候可能还是会卖，但我相信这样的调研结果绝不是在Axie那边可以看到的。也就是说我认为死亡螺旋开始后的变卖压力有较高概率会比Axie低，下降坡度会更缓慢，回本周期受到的负面影响与普通链游相比更小，因为一部分用户在参与过程中会向utility投入做出一定转变，导致对原本投资回报敏感度降低，而更focus在utility的回报。\n\n### 3）STEPN的死亡螺旋后的平缓期或许有更大前景：\n\n* **Axie：**\n\n  **a. 死亡螺旋的结果不是死亡，而是慢慢显露出产品对市场的公允价值 (fair value)**：经历过死亡螺旋的大幅下跌后，现在AXS的市值已经稳定在3 billion的平缓期近三个月了，Axie的价格降低到更多人较易获取 (accessible) 的50美元左右一只。这时入场的投入门槛低，但回本周期依然长，不过因为游戏本身带给玩家的utility回报（游戏乐趣）有限，以回本和净赚为目标的玩家依旧会感受到折磨。而且对于总玩家中那85%的公会雇佣兵来说，Axie的产出 (yield) 已经低过了现实中的工作，参与率下降，反而之前有兴趣尝试Axie但嫌门票贵的真正的玩家，也就是”**观望的C类玩家**“们有机会进来尝试，意味着死亡螺旋让Axie过了快速膨胀宣传期、终于有了欢迎真实玩家入场的机会。回本周期拉长的公会和收入降低的雇佣兵们不开心，但死亡螺旋引起的下跌还是给最需要享受其游戏乐趣的广大真实玩家带来了机会。我和一起看游戏的同事Alex都认为P2E不是目的，而是获客方式（UA）- Axie的故事以不成熟方式间接印证了这一理论：P2E的狂欢让Axie省去了冷启动买量的步骤，得以早期快速获得大量资金、用户以及打磨产品的机会，经历死亡螺旋后入场门槛恢复到了游戏自身的公允价值 (fair value)，由真正为了玩这款游戏的玩家（而非投机者）来参与以及取代。\n* **STEPN：**\n\n**a. STEPN死亡螺旋后也会稳定在比Axie更高的平缓期价值，且会有比当前更多的用户和更大的市场**：当最便宜的灰鞋价格从1000刀下降到比如100刀时，虽然回本周期很长（比如一年），坚持不下去的玩家的投入就变成了沉没成本来pay坚持下去的玩家，但只要你坚持下去，系统就会奖励你回本，因为当投入从1000刀降低到100刀时，玩家会对自己的沉没成本更加宽容，导致无法坚持下去的人更多，沉没成本收集的更多，这时会形成一个比较稳定的balance，于上文中AXS当前稳定下来的价格类似。这时STEPN已经从一个赚钱项目摇身一变成了一款对赌协议：花100刀买一个监督自己坚持跑步的项目，当你坚持下去不光可以回收那100刀，甚至可以继续稳定的赚钱，how does that sound？\n\n**b. 仿盘可以撑的了一时但成不了一事，不会影响STEPN的长期价值**：那么聪明的小伙伴们可能就要问了，那我作为玩家到时候找个仿盘继续跑能赚的更多，为什么要继续在STEPN上呆着？我觉得这方面可以看看Axie：仿盘数量谁也比不上Axie，那Axie的仿盘都是什么样的结果？虽然有人能赚到钱，但它们周期更短，市值更小，且对真正赚钱的玩家要求不是一般的高：要深刻学习到有哪些高产出 (yield) 的项目、谁在做盘、是否进的够早、什么时候得跑 - 的确到时候会有一波对财务投资回报敏感的STEPN的用户去仿盘尝试赚钱，但终究仿盘们会die down，会让这些人受伤后、带着运动的习惯，重新回归到经过时间证明的、yield较低但稳定的STEPN；而这只是财务投资回报敏感的用户，那么更偏重utility投资回报的用户是不太愿意花如此多精力时间冒仿盘的险，而这也是STEPN用户和Axie用户的最大区别 - Axie的公会玩家可是需要用这笔钱过日子的，怎么能不用最大努力来最大化回报？再加上STEPN后面的社交属性和其他叙事 (narrative)、以及依靠自己最大体量发育起来旁氏经济之外的资源和资金流入能力（比如电商、碳排放、品牌合作等）以及创始人们的叙事 (narrative) 能力、用户的真实度和高质量，我相信STEPN或许可以成为一个比Axie更能站到最后的品牌。\n\n**总结**\n\n虽然死亡螺旋对Ponzinomics来说不可避免，但我写这篇文章的目的是想说明以下几点：\n\n1. 首先死亡螺旋的结果不是死亡，更不代表产品的失败，而是从X2E的疯狂回归至产品本身的公允价值的过程，而这个过程发生前的潜伏期有长有短，发生时的下降速度有快有慢，发生后回归到的公允价值有高有低。\n   * Axie作为第一个火的XXX赚钱项目 (或者叫X2E) 经历了很多trial and error，为后面的产品展示出了X2E的可能性、局限性、以及长时间运营下会遇到的挑战，从而让我们看到了如STEPN这样的项目在学习过程中取其精华努力创新 - X2E正在进化。\n   * 而我们期待的**X2E的进化，正是更克制的疯狂期、更慢速的退烧期，更高的公允价值回归线**- 这也是我认为STEPN有潜力做到的。\n   * 在这之外更重要的是能够最终做到，**让认可项目公允价值本身的用户变为主流，使utility价值投资者而非投机者获取大部分收益。（认可参与这样的项目不是简单的投10块赚20块，而是投10块不光值了项目本身带来utility的价值，还额外返还了3块；并且对于坚持下去的用户额外奖励，可以达到10块甚至20块返还的可能性。）**\n   * 未来的故事中Ponzinomics之外的经济来源是我对X2E很期待的地方，因为比当前链游的P2E更有故事和空间：比如最近我刚聊到一个Bike to Earn的项目（MOTE by Sweetgum Labs，有兴趣的投资人欢迎一起交流）提到了碳排放变现回流经济，那么举个例子的话，一个本来每天开车往返10公里上班的人改为每天骑车，一年可以省下4吨的碳排放，而一吨碳排放在欧洲当前可以价值80欧元，就意味着**一个人一年可以变现300多欧元来回流到经济系统**，而将来碳价的提升会让此机制更增加潜力。虽然肯定会有很多操作和价格上的挑战，但X2E产品在向外部经济回流这个方向努力，是我非常期待看到的。\n\n**写在最后**\n\n说了这么多我认为STEPN比Axie具有优势的地方，再强调一遍这并非投资建议，因为项目的运营除了基本面以外，很大程度上取决于掌权者和大户参与者 - STEPN能第一时间让三大交易所合作，以及whale拉盘时的慷慨都展示了很多STEPN在基本面之外的一些实力。最终STEPN的发展方向终归还是取决于项目里各种重要要素之间的利弊平衡以及动荡不安的市场。以上的分析是基于目前得到的各方面信息推测STEPN后面可能经历的一些节点和潜力，最终如何，就让我们拭目以待。", "timestamp": 1658289031, "digest": "uj_1WXmgWFHmyTGMOW1WgmFB_249TfKxG8DzKQGUWtU", "contributor": "0xa1923FB3ff4e7ed8766EC98E61Ac979F59009aFc"}
