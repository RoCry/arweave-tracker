In the time since the provenance hash for Otherdeed NFT collection [was first written to the contract](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe3af78b358819e12ab1bee608e7e480e7897df3003b2afe754e8619f4205b113), three corrections have been made to the collection metadata, necessitating an update of the original hash on-chain. A summary of the corrections and instructions on how to compute the Otherdeed collection provenance on your own are below.\n\n## Summary of Metadata Corrections\n\n1. Due to a bug in the script used to generate the collection metadata, the `Rugged Pickaxe` artifact was incorrectly omitted from the metadata for Otherdeed NFTs that correctly depicted the artifact in the NFT image. This was updated shortly after the reveal.\n2. The `Stone Hole Jackson` Koda body type from the original Otherdeed collection metadata has been updated to `Stone Holes`. This was missed by the several rounds of audits by sensitivity readers.\n3. Due to developer oversight, a typo was included in the`Octo Tentaclenotinfinalcollection` Koda attribute, it is now `Octo Tentacle`\n\n## Verifying the Otherdeed Collection Provenance\n\nThe raw Otherdeed collection metadata as well as a Ruby script to reproduce the provenance hash are available [in this open source GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yuga-labs/land_provenance).", "timestamp": 1658273148, "digest": "3OhsFmFx9bq57rBixtKb0ekvDrlQjjpGuwidgJUB-dA", "contributor": "0xEc9f53fA69682833FBd760C104B5D61aE29221E0"}

This included experience and views from DAOs, other decentralised networks, the co-operative movement, Indigenous cultures, purpose-led business, and civic and systems innovation.\n\nWe explored perspectives on the essential functions and attributes of governance, and the design implications for governance arrangements that seek to foster decentralisation, pluralism, and regeneration.\n\nEach of the conversations were framed around a question (click the links to listen to a recording of the conversation):\n\n1. **June 2, 2022:** [Metagovernance -
