In the time since the provenance hash for Otherdeed NFT collection [was first written to the contract](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe3af78b358819e12ab1bee608e7e480e7897df3003b2afe754e8619f4205b113), three corrections have been made to the collection metadata, necessitating an update of the original hash on-chain. A summary of the corrections and instructions on how to compute the Otherdeed collection provenance on your own are below.\n\n## Summary of Metadata Corrections\n\n1. Due to a bug in the script used to generate the collection metadata, the `Rugged Pickaxe` artifact was incorrectly omitted from the metadata for Otherdeed NFTs that correctly depicted the artifact in the NFT image. This was updated shortly after the reveal.\n2. The `Stone Hole Jackson` Koda body type from the original Otherdeed collection metadata has been updated to `Stone Holes`. This was missed by the several rounds of audits by sensitivity readers.\n3. Due to developer oversight, a typo was included in the`Octo Tentaclenotinfinalcollection` Koda attribute, it is now `Octo Tentacle`\n\n## Verifying the Otherdeed Collection Provenance\n\nThe raw Otherdeed collection metadata as well as a Ruby script to reproduce the provenance hash are available [in this open source GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yuga-labs/land_provenance).", "timestamp": 1658273148, "digest": "3OhsFmFx9bq57rBixtKb0ekvDrlQjjpGuwidgJUB-dA", "contributor": "0xEc9f53fA69682833FBd760C104B5D61aE29221E0"}

This included experience and views from DAOs, other decentralised networks, the co-operative movement, Indigenous cultures, purpose-led business, and civic and systems innovation.\n\nWe explored perspectives on the essential functions and attributes of governance, and the design implications for governance arrangements that seek to foster decentralisation, pluralism, and regeneration.\n\nEach of the conversations were framed around a question (click the links to listen to a recording of the conversation):\n\n1. **June 2, 2022:** [Metagovernance -

Products need to move onto L2 networks\n2. Exchanges need to provide cheap on-ramps directly to L2\n3.

This was very clear in the “DeFi summer” of 2020, and the NFT explosion in 2021. Transaction fees became too expensive and it priced people out. Eventually, only whales could afford to make profitable trades in DeFi, and only large speculators would mint Yuga Labs NFTs in 2021.\n\n# Exchanges need to provide cheap on-ramps directly to L2 (for a few cents)\n\nWe shouldn’t expect users to buy ETH and bridge to L2. Users need to purchase L2 tokens directly from exchanges with fiat, and then send them cheaply into the L2 networks so that they can use those products. We should look at apps like Coinbase to help onboard users to L2. \n\n# Products and specifically wallets need to abstract L2 networks\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether someone uses MasterCard or Visa these days. All of the payment processors can handle either and they abstract the differences. The same thing needs to happen with L2 networks, and it’s likely the wallets the need to take on this task.\n\nDifferent products will launch on different L2s. It’ll be messy if we expect users to navigate all of the different L2s, and so wallets (Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, Argent, etc) need to abstract the L2s and provide ways to bridge between them seamlessly.

I tak rozumcie zk.money bo coś w tym jest. 😜\n\n \n Od razu napiszę, że nie mam się za jakiegoś GURU. Napiszę to co wiem, a wiem pewnie troszkę więcej niż ty ziom. Postaram się pisać językiem abyś mnie zrozumiał.  \n Jest to też potencjalna spekulacja. Większość osób ma oczy skierowane w kierunku **#StarkNet**. Ja zwykle stoję z boku i obserwuję podobne protokoły, które mają mniejszy socialhype i fajnie się rozwijają. Dlatego dziś będzie o zk.money a nie o StarkNet.\n\n## zk.money - warstwa 2 na ETH skupiona na prywatności 👀\n\n[zk.money](https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork) to dApps do ochrony prywatności w warstwie 2 umożliwiająca użytkownikom prywatne przesyłanie **$ETH, $DAI & $renBTC** ( renBTC *był w v1 ale v2 obecnie off - wróci, spokojnie*). Zk.Money jest zbudowane na silniku [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) (*Zk-Rollup na Eth)*.  \n Aztec jest porównywalny do [zkSync](https://medium.com/@CalendarDefi/airdrop-guide-zksync-zigzag-a83ef3b33b70), ale koncentruje się na prywatności, której w #zkSync brak imo.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XME4s721Yez0zhziC8YLK.png?height=891&width=2545)\n\n**Podam prosty przykład anonimowej wysyłki $ETH :**\n\n* **Deponujesz** *(shield) *$ETH **lub** $DAI z mainetu na **zk-money L2 \n **\n* Znając **alias *(login)*** drugiej osoby wysyłasz jej $ETH lub $Dai po L2 (sobie, delerowi, whatever). Koszt transakcji bardzo niski (L2). Dzięki technologi **zero-knowledge proof** druga strona otrzyma ETH, ale nie będzie wiadomo od kogo. Co ciekawsze ty jako wysyłający masz dostęp do potwierdzenia, że transakcja pochodzi od Ciebie (gdyby zaszła taka potrzeba to, to potwierdzisz).  \n **Nikt inny nie ma do tego dostępu bez twojego walletu!**  \n \n* Gdy zamiast aliasu odbiorcy podasz adres ethereum środki zostaną wysłane na mainet. I ten przykład w moim przypadku ma utility w kwestiach spekulacji & sybilu na multiwalletach. Rozumiesz schemat prawda? Ahhh, jak ja dużo Ci mówię…🤫\n\n## Dobra spekulancie, wiem co interesuje Cię najbardziej… Co ja tam mam robić niby, co?🤫\n\n[Zk.Money](https://zk.money/) i sieć [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) działają już na mainecie. Ani jedno, ani drugie nie ma jeszcze tokena. Czy będzie ? Czas pokaże. Ja obserwuje i klikam bo jara mnie ta technologia. Uważam, że *Satoshi Nakamoto* byłby dumny z tego co tu się odpierdala. Jak ktoś podchodzi do tematu czysto spekulacyjnie to uważam, że jest teraz na to dobry czas. Dlaczego? Niedawno przeszli na mainet. Ruski gas od Vitalika, też nie taki straszny, jak straszą nas w mediach głównego ścieku 🤮\n\n### Dobra - napiszę, co tam do przeklikania\n\nNa początek musisz wejść na [zk.money](https://zk.money/signup) połączyć portfel (np. Metamask) i stworzyć swój alias \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2WIEKnA3MGihB0EOc2p8B.png?height=993&width=1635)\n\nNastępnie podpisać kilka transakcji i go zarejestrować, po czym zdeponować minimum **0.01 ETH** w celu aktywacji konta.  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MB-G30l7eZtNDojkifd3f.png?height=2151&width=3117)\n\n**Włalaaaa - Done!** Masz już swój alias i interakcje z kontraktem.  \n  \n **UWAGA!** Zapisz swój alias bo gdy go utracisz -- utracisz swoje środki.  \n W zkmoney **.v1** gdy nie pamiętaliśmy swojego aliasu można było wygenerować nowy. W **.v2** jest to niemożliwe! \n  \n Warto pójść o krok dalej i popatrzyć co protokół ma nam do zaoferowania. \n Zk.Money V1 oferowało nam jedynie przesyłanie ETH, DAI i renBTC pomiędzy walletami L2 & Mainet. Team postanowił pójść o krok dalej. Obecnie rozwijają private-defi aby na warstwie drugiej poza zwykłym ‘anonimowym’ przesyłaniem wartości dostępne były swapy, stakinngi i inne bajery, które znamy z DEFI. Zaczeli z [LIDO](https://lido.fi/) (staking ETH dla ETH 2.0) - obecnie 4,38% APY. Druga opcja, która już jest wdrożona to staking DAI w współpracy z [ElementFi](https://www.element.fi/) . Znaleść to możemy w zakładce [EARN](https://zk.money/earn). Warto to przeklikać i wrzucić coś ETH do LIDO czy troche DAI do ElementFi na staking. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rS8YpDbaq0A3Kk8agtL7f.png?height=1188&width=2513)\n\n## 👇 Kolejne protokoły soooon ser 👇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i7DBEBz3n4o8U91Qs04DG.png?height=810&width=2494)\n\n## Co jeszcze warto zrobić?\n\n* Warto przerzucić assety z L2 na Mainet. Aby to zrobić przy wysyłce zamiast aliasu należy wkleić adres ETH *\\[0x…\\] \n *\n* Warto też przesłać asset po sieci L2. Aby to zrobić należy wkleić nie adres ETH, a alias odbiorcy. Możesz ‘posypać’ Popusiowi. Ahhh. Nie wypada tak mówić. Anyway, jak podoba Ci się, to co robie i tak bardzo chcesz - mój login masz na screenach wyżej. \n \n* Jeśli interesuje Cię więcej, warto dołączyć na [Discord](https://discord.gg/DePA3Uvd)\n\n### UWAGA!\n\n> Co do oficjalnej informacji o *#airdrop*.  Team nic takiego nie potwierdził.  \n Nie potwierdzili też tego, że kiedykolwiek powstanie token. Dodam, że większość potwierdzonych dropów wychodziła słabo. Zgodzisz się ze mną? \n *“…Cicha woda brzegi rwie!”*  \n\nNa koniec jeszcze jedna uwaga. Jeśli obserwujesz mnie dłużej to pewnie o zk.money już wiesz i bawiłeś się tam już na v1. Jeśli tak to zaloguj się na [old.zk.money](https://old.zk.money/) i przenieś swoje assety na L1 po czym dokonaj ponownej migracji na L2 tworząc nowy alias. Tak mi doradzono na discordzie i tak zrobiłem. \n\nTemat będę obserwował dalej. Jeśli Cię to zainteresowało zapraszam do mnie na telegram i twitter aby być na bieżąco.\n\n* [Twitter Popek1990.eth](https://twitter.com/popek1990crypto)\n* [Telegram Popek1990.ETH \\[Ogłoszenia\\]](https://t.me/popek1990crypto)\n\n```\nDyskusje w komentarzach na twitter ✌️\n```", "timestamp": 1658274549, "digest": "lWecFymSfagUdIlhOwLDJpjIBPlm-3qG4_FmT9vnfvU", "contributor": "0x4f0a57351c468842A6F0efE26597195A1F29e239"}

It is also Ethereum's first great alternative to the mainstream publishing platforms like Medium and WordPress.\n\n**Some of their highlights:**\n\n[https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x9F6F91078A5072A8B54695DAfA2374Ab3cCd603b](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x9F6F91078A5072A8B54695DAfA2374Ab3cCd603b)\n\n[https://ens.mirror.xyz/-eaqMv7XPikvXhvjbjzzPNLS4wzcQ8vdOgi9eNXeUuY](https://ens.mirror.xyz/-eaqMv7XPikvXhvjbjzzPNLS4wzcQ8vdOgi9eNXeUuY)\n\n[https://kitteh.mirror.xyz/editions/0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175/40](https://kitteh.mirror.xyz/editions/0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175/40)\n\n## Importance of Mirror\n\nNow anyone could put out anything that they've published as NFTs, enabling their biggest fans to support them and become early investors in their work. Readers could send tips and receive tokens as a reward for supporting their favorite writers which results in building a vibrant community and Mirror provides smart contracts for crowd-funding a new initiative directly from the writings.\n\nAll this by completely circumventing advertisers who constantly interrupt your reading flow by getting in your face with messaging hints at every visit!\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1449909594516455426](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1449909594516455426)\n\n## How do Mirror Works?\n\nMirror uses Arweave to permanently store users' content. The average cost of storing data on the decentralized storage protocol currently is $0.01 per gigabyte, which Mirror takes care of for its users. In doing so, they are able to offer free publishing services. Additionally, unlike traditional online platforms that require strenuous login processes and accounts, Mirror uses\n\n\"Sign in with Ethereum\" method for authentication. It makes independent verification possible through non-Ethereum keypair that signs the posts and are stored in Arweave which then is paired with writers Ethereum address. Nobody has to disclose any private information, no need to sign up for an email account and no need for creation of a new password.\n\n## Key Features\n\n* **Mirror Editor**\n\nThis text editor and publisher lets users build posts with media blocks. eg: Images, crypto economic blocks, and embedded auctions.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editor](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editor)\n\n* **Crowd Funding**\n\nMirror lets users crowdfund a project, i.e. an Ethereum smart contract for raising funds, via its text and media blocks - like videos. Contributors receive a token(ERC20) that represents their participation and ownership in the project.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/crowdfunds](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/crowdfunds)\n\n* **Splits**\n\nSplit is an ERC20-compliant smart contract-based payments routing mechanism that lets creators allocate funds from auctions or donations to “collaborators, the people that have inspired you, or to donate proceeds from your work.”\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/splits](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/splits)\n\n* **Entry NFTs**\n\nPosts on Mirror can be minted as 1/1 non-fungible tokens. This means that they are collectors items that anyone who wants a souvenir of this moment in time or just an avid fan can help the creator get some financial backing for the creation of future projects!\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/mint-writing-nfts](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/mint-writing-nfts)\n\n* **Edition**\n\nA functionality for creating a limited supply of identical NFTs at a fixed price, e.g. 100 pieces of crypto-art. This new feature will bring about an exciting new implementation for non-fungible items and will allow users to create fixed editions, as well as trade and identify digital art through various methods on the blockchain with ease.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editions](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editions)\n\n* **Entry Editions**\n\nCreators can use this tokenization system to mint their Mirror posts as limited-edition NFTs instead of 1/1s.\n\n* **Tokens**\n\nA decentralized frontend for easy ERC20 token minting and distribution of governance token to build vibrant communities.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/tokens](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/tokens)\n\n## How to create a Crowdfund?\n\n1\\.

It has funded notable projects including Uniswap, 1Inch, Yearn Finance, and more. It was founded by Scott Moore, Kevin Owocki, and Vivek Singh in November 2017.\n\n## Key features of Gitcoin\n\n**Earn:** Help develop public goods by offering bounties to those who work on open source projects, organize hackathons and other fundraisers sponsored by some of the most innovative Web3 organizations, or start a new initiative to help solve some of humanity’s most pressing coordination problems.\n\n* [Earn in bounties](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?network=mainnet&applicants=ALL&order_by=-_val_usd_db)\n* [Earn in hackathons](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons)\n* [Earn in grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/)\n\n**Learn:** Help build and shape the blockchain industry by participating in hackathons, workshops and roundtable discussions hosted by the experts of the industry. Or, if you’re looking for a more hands-on approach to learning material, why not do what some of our finest minds do and prepare yourself as one of them would? Find them, network with them, and study under their wing. That's right. They are offering a Kernel fellowship program so that you too can become a blockchain Kernel.\n\n* [Learn in a hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons)\n* [Learn through fellowship](https://www.kernel.community/en/)\n* [Learn through Quests](https://gitcoin.co/quests)\n\n**Connect:** Join the next generation of web developers as you connect and build with top open source developers in the space. Find peers who compliment your skillset and team up to take on bounties and hackathons. Or join their 8 week Kernel fellowship program online where they mentor, guide and support each other through hands-on training while engaging in weekly meet-ups and workshops!\n\n* [Connect through fellowship](https://www.kernel.community/en/)\n* [Connect through building](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons)\n\n**Funding:** Fund the open web and shape its future. Choose the projects and technology you believe are most vital to the health of this world, and contribute to them directly during quarterly Gitcoin Grants rounds which use quadratic funding.\n\n* [Fund grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/)\n\n## How do Gitcoin Grants work?\n\nIt starts with a Grant page, a pool of funds, and a community of contributors.\n\nGrants begin with a page for your project and a pool of matching funds. Using the power of quadratic funding, donors will signal their support for grantees and democratically decide where the matching funds should go.\n\nIf you’re a grantee, one of the important things to note is that the number and amount of each contribution to your project influences the total amount allocated to you. If you’re a contributor, even a small contribution can have a huge impact on the amount of matching funding a grantee gets .This is the power of quadratic funding.\n\nFor example:\n\n> Traditional matching<!-- -->Grant 1 gets $100.<!-- -->Grant 2 gets $100.<!-- -->At the end of the round, both grants get $100 in matching.\n\n> Gitcoin quadratic matching<!-- -->Grant 1 gets $100 from 1 funder.<!-- -->Grant 2 gets $100 from 10 funders.<!-- -->At the end of the round, Grant 1 gets $10 in matching, Grant 2 gets $190 in matching.\n\nSee how a number of small contributions can have a huge impact on the total amount of matching funding a grantee gets!\n\nGitcoin Grants is really all about communities coming together to help fund and signal support for public goods.\n\n### How to create a Grant?\n\n1\\.

{"id": "hPjDvcMc6L_tEeHPS6St6ETwjYMfoT1vIr6rytkvDzk", "title": "The DAO Story of FINE#8385", "body": "Hey! I am FINE & I am doing fine. I will be honest, I am no story teller but I want my story to be out there! Why? Because of the possibilities and opportunities that DAOs are offering right now for everyone. We are entering a new age, an age where age, color, caste, nationality, religion or nothing matters for earning or owning something. What you need is an internet connection and basic ideas about how these DAO things work to make a living, to build your empire or even To start a movement. Okay let's start.\n\nI am an 18year old boy in India working part time for DAOs. What will make most of you interested is the fact that I can earn more than 400 dollars  for a couple of hours mainly because of my knowledge in this field and guys I am just getting started. I know the amount is no big deal but the way I am earning it is something all of you should care about! Why? There is no escape from new technology, when the internet came everyone had no option but to go with it, that's how new tech works. Entered DAOs only in the beginning of march. In case you don't know what a DAO is, it is a decentralized autonomous organization that means an organization that runs by code and no major person has the final say and instead the community has the major say. How is all this possible? Well the answer is Blockchain technology. A new technology is also = things happening that never happened in human history before! Actually I have a lot to say and donno where to start. I may derail from the track from what I am saying so please stick with me.\n\nI got hyped about blockchain technology after watching the [comments of top tech leaders](https://youtu.be/GVN0Ddr3xig) on blockchain technology. I started just like most of the people, started trading crypto currency and lost money, my entry to crypto was in July 2021. Started heavily learning about everything from the [Coin Bureau](https://youtu.be/Fu4lrv47c0g) youtube channel and the journey of 8months led me to the gem DAOs!! \n\nI just lost interest in making money and wanted to follow my heart. I always wanted to serve humanity, so I setted out to start an organisation! An organisation where anyone can tell their problems and anyone can make a living for solving those problems! Ironically the organisation name is also FINE. I got this name from my Father, he is a hardworking man who just can't stop working!(farmer blood). Even though the project is still down I learned something. This is something I always knew but I think I fully understood it only when I experienced it. I was behind money making = no value. I was behind something of value to the world and all of a sudden I started earning! \n\nI went to ARAGON DAO to create and manage DAO as it is the go to place for everyone of DAOs, the community was really helpful specially anson parker. \n\nI saw a bounty there. They were looking for Hindi translators to translate their documents. I was 99% sure that I wouldn't get it, as there were many better candidates than me. Still I applied and I remember those lines \" Hey! I am a student and I understand 5 languages \" \n\nA person who goes by the Identity @Lion917 reached out to me and guided me to Bankless South Asia DAO!** \n **\n\nI started as a Malayalam translator there using my 4years old complaint phone Vivo Y55s. Pointing it out just to say that. We don't need a heavy setup to earn or start, it definitely helps but it would be better if we just start right away with what we have and trust me it is more than enough!\n\nNo one will judge you here. We just respect the effort and give maximum support expecting nothing in return! I had knowledge in blockchain space for the past 7months so it was not that kind of a big deal for me to trust everything. For a beginner it would be hard but the community will help you out. Beware of scams please.. There are plenty of them. Okay coming to the point. I am now working for an Internet community without knowing anyone's name and not revealing my own identity. Here skills matter more than certificates. I was getting paid in an internet currency or governance token. Hey, here is another big deal of working for DAOs. In our real life we get paid in fiat currency if we work for an organisation but here we get the share of the company i.e. governance token = you have a say or you can shape the future of the organisation you are working for!! About hierarchical structure, here we the contributors have the say. Let me get back to my experiences.\n\nI received my first payment at the end of the month and I felt sooo proud; it was proof that all my weird thoughts(for the majority) were true. This is an untaken path for the masses for now. I then started attending the weekly meetings which were more than amazing!! There is this Awesome guy called @0xbaer who made me really comfortable there. Guided me through everything and even helped me through everything. Another thing to point out is everybody is kind here. One reason is because if we are not we will be kicked. My 1st bounty work was pathetic. I understood it only later. They carefully started pointing out everything I did right and then requested me to make some parts better. Later I started attending weekly meetings which lead me to more opportunities. Attending meetings is another great way to get involved heavily.\n\nI then became a marketer, content creator, reviewer and even the coordinator! The growth was exponential. If I was going with the masses, I would be attending school and hating the things I should be learning etc etc but here, I was so damn interested in learning as everything was helping me right away. Actually I was getting paid for learning if we look through this angle. Reading newsletter = learning. I was learning and getting exposed to outside parties. I was getting guided In the right direction. I wanted to work full time for DAOs and started joining other DAOs and started using the same butterfly principle again. \n\nA guy named @enfin reached out to me and introduced peopleDAO and Language DAO! Attended some meetings and I am part of the accounting team, writer, multi Sig signer and Mod operator! I had no prior experience doing any of these!! \n\nThe point is everything is flexible here, if you are willing to take the effort this is a golden opportunity! I am a person who lives by the lines: Never trade time for money!! I am so comfortable here as there Is meaning for the time I am spending. I am getting ownership in the community! \n\nThere are no bad vibe hierarchies here. I have to speak about @jengajojo.eth. An amazing person, Leader of IMN. I am pretty sure he is super solid and busy! I didn't know it and was always reaching out to him for doubts and help. He was replying ASAP and helping, which doesn't make sense if we look at our traditional hierarchies. Can we just go to the MD and say: hey i don't know what to do! ? No right? I am not saying that there is no hierarchical structure here. In Fact we do and there is no escape from hierarchies in any creative domains. I just didn't know whom I should be talking to and I went to Jenga. 90% of the people you see here will be like that. That's what from my experience I understood. \n\nHey! Another thing, did you know that you could get paid just for chilling?? Well there are rewards for active community members also. What that literally means is a little earning just for being active in the community. I said little just because I don't want to sound like DAOs get rich quickly. When you are an experienced person with knowledge it is easy. We need ideas about these things mainly. For example we haven't learned how exactly you are able to read this but you know how to read and benefit from this! We don't fully understand the working mechanism behind calls but we do have business calls with it. What I am trying to say is as long as you have trust in all these things and the idea, you can do anything.\n\nWorking for DAOs is like having a taste of the future! \n\n** \n  \n  \n **", "timestamp": 1658275373, "digest": "OVoGs2Oxgt3bMJ4ObmTqsGAHtRdftZaJVP1H7Ed_cW0", "contributor": "0x155250d3465Fc910a910b7C67d20C4Dd25fcb728"}

Yet, we are still pouring our money into luxuries which diminish the state of our earth. If we don’t do something to support the environment, the earth will truly be f\\*cked.\n\n## Our mission\n\nWe are living in a capitalistic system driven by money: making money the most effective driver for change. To renew the economy into a greener one, we must channel more economic activity and funding into sustainable companies.\n\n### Current philanthropic organizations are not effective\n\nOne of the major entities in supporting social impact initiatives is philanthropic organizations. But, they operate confidentially. So, when we intend to donate our pocket change toward global causes, we don’t know where the money really ends up.\n\nMoreover, philanthropic organizations aim to address the short-term hurdle (ex. logging). We believe that investing in scalable projects that overcome sustainable problems at their roots\n\n### Blockchain enables everyone to invest in sustainable impact\n\nFor the last decade, groups of wealthy investors all over the world have been working to support, and invest in social impact initiatives and innovations. Yet, we, everyday investors are left out due to the lack of infrastructure.\n\nWe envision a community, regardless of contribution amount, that can band together to invest in sustainable impact.\n\nThrough recent explorations using blockchain technology, new forms of decentralized communities emerged and paved the path for making this a reality.\n\nWe are using a DAO to create a democratized and inclusive investment community thats scalable.\n\n## What we are working on\n\nWe are building ArborDAO, a DAO that collectively invests in sustainability startups using crypto.\n\nWe want to become an early fund for green founders who are seeking support, a collective investment community through crypto, and a community bridge for anyone to support green projects.\n\n## We need you!\n\nEveryone is welcome to ArborDAO.

Yet, we are still pouring our money into luxuries which diminish the state of our earth. If we don’t do something to support the environment, the earth will truly be f\\*cked.\n\n## Our mission\n\nWe are living in a capitalistic system driven by money: making money the most effective driver for change. To renew the economy into a greener one, we must channel more economic activity and funding into sustainable companies.\n\n### Current philanthropic organizations are not effective\n\nOne of the major entities in supporting social impact initiatives is philanthropic organizations. But, they operate confidentially. So, when we intend to donate our pocket change toward global causes, we don’t know where the money really ends up.\n\nMoreover, philanthropic organizations aim to address the short-term hurdle (ex. logging). We believe that investing in scalable projects that overcome sustainable problems at their roots\n\n### Blockchain enables everyone to invest in sustainable impact\n\nFor the last decade, groups of wealthy investors all over the world have been working to support, and invest in social impact initiatives and innovations. Yet, we, everyday investors are left out due to the lack of infrastructure.\n\nWe envision a community, regardless of contribution amount, that can band together to invest in sustainable impact.\n\nThrough recent explorations using blockchain technology, new forms of decentralized communities emerged and paved the path for making this a reality.\n\nWe are using a DAO to create a democratized and inclusive investment community thats scalable.\n\n## What we are working on\n\nWe are building ArborDAO, a DAO that collectively invests in sustainability startups using crypto.\n\nWe want to become an early fund for green founders who are seeking support, a collective investment community through crypto, and a community bridge for anyone to support green projects.\n\n## We need you!\n\nEveryone is welcome to ArborDAO.

{"id": "DtKcyENfhxjKVFkmZCkg4WLUn3l-KqFnjW2SSO4xIzk", "title": "Web3: Narratives of Disruption", "body": "Instead of pursuing a false debate on whether this next-generation technology should be centralized or decentralized, we should ask how best can we arrange the narrative for desirable decentralization. This engaging narrative is constructed by making the mission and objectives among Web3 platforms more about coordination. In turn, this will create a space that allows individuals to maintain ownership and autonomy of the internet and its foundations. This is not some kind of freakish fiction but rather a reality of what is possible in today's Web3 repository. Through innovative technologies (NFT platforms, currency exchange, and wallet providers) in tandem with people-powered initiatives, Web3 is blossoming into a system of efficiently solving the problem found in centralized systems. Allowing self-sovereign identities their right for communication, privacy, and governance, but that doesn't come without its obstacles.\n\n**Objective / Disclaimer**\n\nWeb3 is unfolding into new territories daily, building communities to find each other, holding themselves accountable towards the same mission and connecting with others. As a disclaimer to you reading this post, I am not an expert. I am naturally a researcher and enthusiast of the possibilities behind Web3 and decentralized narratives. I hope that by the time you finish reading this, you feel more familiar with Web3 and how decentralization plays a crucial role in facilitating the new narratives of what the internet was always meant to serve. I also strongly encourage everyone to always do as a motto states and \"Do your own research\" (DYOR) as a practice.\n\n**Pre-requisite**\n\nLet's start with Web1, which started around the early 90s, a version of the internet that was a space where consumers were primarily users on an open network of information (the read-only era). What Web1 had was many barriers to entry because of how technical the user experience was, which excluded the majority from using the internet. Leading us into the Web2 age, the centralization age came in with fewer barriers to entry due to big tech platforms such as Yahoo and Google who provided us with excellent user experience interfaces. This grew the consumer demand at scale. Most of us use this version today, where the primary focus is targeted advertisements and lack of privacy heralded by the arrival of social media. The Web2 internet we know today has needed the reliance on centralized intermediaries (Google, Meta, Amazon).\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nThe main principle of Web3 is decentralization. Rather than being controlled by Big Tech, governments, financial institutions, or large corporations, it's entirely run by a community of individuals seeking to make a difference to combat our current Web2 form. This Web2 form has been governed by addictive, abrasive, and controlling narratives that I believe users are fed up with. Now, the technology underpinning Web3 makes it possible for far more inventive open-source and decentralized systems to be created — and enables decentralized economies (based on Blockchain systems that incentivize the stakeholders, developers, contributors, and consumers alike) to form around them. When this happens successfully will enable the products and services of Web3 to compete with and eventually surpass those of Web2.\n\n**Opportunity**\n\nCreatives now have an opportunity to leverage this technology and set it up to become a significant driver of economic growth. This can alter the workforce economy into new realms of possibility to significantly impact how we operate as a society (think about how DAOs, NFTs, and the Metaverse can help play this out?!). This is where I find the most utopic possibility in Web3, where the creator economy and the workforce collide. Bringing artists, lawyers, developers, and creators together from around the globe to create ideas and monetize them globally in permissionless crypto-economic systems— and essentially defining the future of work.\n\n**Value Creation**\n\nIdeas and community contributions of working toward a shared goal that gains value over time (through individuals who feed that value creation) are gaining momentum in various social communities (Friends with benefits, Forefront, and Party DAO). A concept that results in an ecosystem of equity that doesn't exclude the niche. The governing principle behind Web 3 takes us back to the idea we spoke about at the start of this post around Web1 which was the first version of open-source visions, so we are right back where we started. In a space filled with skeptics, naysayers, and the uninterested, my advice to you is to find where your area is in Web3 and begin to implement the change you want to see in the future. This isn't going anywhere, nor is it a hoax— It's the early stages of something completely new and has the potential to be shaped by the right set of values.\n\n**Here a list of some fun places to start:** \n\n* <https://decentraland.org/>\n* <https://rabbithole.gg/>\n* <https://rally.io/>\n* <https://mirror.xyz/>\n* <https://dune.com/home>\n* <https://www.radardao.xyz/>\n* <https://chain.link/>\n* <https://forefront.market/feed>\n* <https://www.fwb.help/>\n* <https://party.mirror.xyz/>\n* <https://gitcoin.co/>\n* <https://flamingodao.xyz/>\n* <https://snapshot.org/#/>\n* <https://rabbithole.gg/>", "timestamp": 1658277879, "digest": "wZskKFe00TcXfxQLMS2HzfNKpC6PijWU7xlNAmbNCy0", "contributor": "0xF1F144271438B53c38Bc502D804878D7b295e563"}

Sushiswap also received a decent chunk from this airdrop.\n\n[https://twitter.com/SushiSwap/status/1306493893492449281?s=20&t=4gg1SnKkzX7f4lyyQepguQ](https://twitter.com/SushiSwap/status/1306493893492449281?s=20&t=4gg1SnKkzX7f4lyyQepguQ)\n\nOver the past two years though, Uniswap has undoubtedly been the winner with the largest DEX market share amongst the two and the Dex market in general. Innovation keeps winning!\n\n## Section 1: Airdrop Recipients $UNI Holdings\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064174/1827931/16bce33c-b27d-478c-acef-e6a20ee5898b?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064174/1827931/16bce33c-b27d-478c-acef-e6a20ee5898b?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064174/1827935/cb95ab2c-bdee-4a49-919c-2f4d2e4c195c?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064174/1827935/cb95ab2c-bdee-4a49-919c-2f4d2e4c195c?display=iframe)\n\nAs seen in the query above, \\~220k addresses have claimed their $UNI tokens and they have claimed a total of \\~136M $UNI tokens. At that time of writing, that $UNI is worth just over $1Billion. That begets the question, what’s the current balance of $UNI tokens held by the $UNI airdrop recipients?\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1037563/1789711/974d8953-f73e-4b4b-81d0-69050943a0ae?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1037563/1789711/974d8953-f73e-4b4b-81d0-69050943a0ae?display=iframe)\n\nAs seen in the chart above, the balance of $UNI held by airdrop recipients has been declining since the airdrop to a current balance of 12.7M $UNI tokens. That is currently only \\~8.5% of the $UNI tokens that was claimed. \n\nThe highest balance (66.7M $UNI held by $UNI airdrop recipients was on September 27th 2020 (just over a week from when the airdrop was announced).\n\nI thought it would be interesting to dig more into this data, so I created two Pie charts that divided the Airdrop recipients into the following profiles:\n\n**Non $UNI Holder** - Addresses that no longer hold $UNI \n**Plankton** - Addresses that hold less than 10k $UNI \n**Shrimp** - Addresses that hold more than 10k $UNI \n**Fish** - Addresses that hold more than 100k $UNI\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1041370/1796243/35ed3031-57b5-466f-b266-e577394ed940?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1041370/1796243/35ed3031-57b5-466f-b266-e577394ed940?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1041370/1796284/4d394f53-0792-4c28-ac06-fd56dac100d8?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1041370/1796284/4d394f53-0792-4c28-ac06-fd56dac100d8?display=iframe)\n\nSimilar to the balance of $UNI held by airdrop recipients, this pie chart is dominated by addresses that no longer hold $UNI tokens - 89.2%.\n\n## Section 2: Top 100 Airdrop Recipients $UNI Holdings\n\nSection 1 analysis would be incomplete if we didn’t look at what the top airdrop recipients were up to. In this [query](https://dune.com/queries/1037369) you can find the top 100 airdrop recipients and how much $UNI they received.\n\nThe top 100 addresses received 30M $UNI in total and currently hold a balance of \\~3.12M $UNI tokens. The ratio of the amount they claimed and current balance is very similar to what we found for all airdrop recipients in Section 1.\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1037407/1789661/5285a353-148c-4620-aa6a-2604a317a722?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1037407/1789661/5285a353-148c-4620-aa6a-2604a317a722?display=iframe)\n\nI created charts of the daily outflows, inflows and netflows for the Top 100 Airdrop recipients and also all airdrop recipients.\n\nIf you want to dig deeper then you can find them [here](https://dune.com/Henrystats/uniswap-2020-airdop-recipients).\n\n## Section 3: Airdrop Recipients Governance Participation\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053492/1812862/dbb4d3a3-e949-482a-8c94-c3aef88f2a90?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053492/1812862/dbb4d3a3-e949-482a-8c94-c3aef88f2a90?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053492/1812865/7e4389b5-7413-45f6-98e1-333bb1716979?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053492/1812865/7e4389b5-7413-45f6-98e1-333bb1716979?display=iframe)\n\nAs seen in the counters above, airdrop recipients have delegated \\~19.3M $UNI of the total 220M $UNI ever delegated.\n\nThe below charts show the total delegated uni vs airdrop recipients delegated uni over time and the number of uni delegators vs airdrop recipients delegators.\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053454/1812756/5b3e304c-473e-44fc-a70a-b4eae423938e?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053454/1812756/5b3e304c-473e-44fc-a70a-b4eae423938e?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053062/1812725/ccc9e1af-6634-44a3-b744-a5b8dabd267f?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053062/1812725/ccc9e1af-6634-44a3-b744-a5b8dabd267f?display=iframe)\n\n**N.B this doesn’t filter for addresses that do not hold $UNI anymore. I’ve created counters to get the number of delegators that still hold $UNI.**\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053963/1829103/cb487cb9-8e33-47e5-b1f3-2ce7be670d1f?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053963/1829103/cb487cb9-8e33-47e5-b1f3-2ce7be670d1f?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053995/1829108/d9fed0a9-0bd3-42c5-8f4d-cb9bf549f356?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053995/1829108/d9fed0a9-0bd3-42c5-8f4d-cb9bf549f356?display=iframe)\n\n## Section 4: Airdrop Recipients Protocol Usage\n\nIn this section, we’ll be looking at our airdrop recipients and their interaction with Uniswap. The first charts we’ll look at is a profile of airdrop recipients defined by the number of trades they’ve made on Uniswap.\n\n**Here are the profiles:**\n\n**Airdrop Seller** - Recipients that made only one transaction \n**Frequent trader** - Recipients that made more than one transaction \n**Active trader** - Recipients that made more than 100 transactions \n**Baby Dolphin Trader** - Recipients that made more than 1000 transactions \n**Dolphin Trader** - Recipients that made more than 10k transactions\n**Whale Trader** - Recipients that made more than 100k transactions\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1045343/1803079/245298e7-fd05-43d7-8707-f7d6d575d5cc?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1045343/1803079/245298e7-fd05-43d7-8707-f7d6d575d5cc?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1045343/1803181/14fcb2bd-f36d-43c1-80f2-62ed9811b1dc?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1045343/1803181/14fcb2bd-f36d-43c1-80f2-62ed9811b1dc?display=iframe)\n\nAs seen in the chart above, the airdrop recipients traded majorly on V2 with \\~180k traders, compared to V3’s \\~60k traders. There were also in total \\~40k recipients that traded only once.\n\nPie Charts do more justice to this data, so here’s some:\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803419/4b825fc9-0b9c-4964-b162-913be22397e2?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803419/4b825fc9-0b9c-4964-b162-913be22397e2?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803427/478bccba-ec0b-4e06-b646-76fdbf2714a1?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803427/478bccba-ec0b-4e06-b646-76fdbf2714a1?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803574/cb878621-6852-4433-81bb-f1194e5d1272?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803574/cb878621-6852-4433-81bb-f1194e5d1272?display=iframe)\n\nInteresting to note that even though there were \\~11m more transactions on V2 than there was on **V3**, the volume traded on **V3** was much higher with a difference of roughly **$100bn**.\n\nThere was in total **\\~$244bn** traded on Uniswap by Airdrop Recipients. That is amazing!\n\n### What were the most traded pairs?\n\nIn this [query](https://dune.com/queries/1046417) you’ll find the top 100 most traded pairs.\n\n**WETH/USDC (V3)** was the largest traded pair with over **$100bn** in volume and a whooping **465k** trades.\n\nFrom the query linked above, all top 10 most traded pairs had at least one of **WETH** or a Stablecoin (**USDC**, **DAI** & **USDT**).\n\n### Total liquidity deposited on Uniswap?\n\nLiquidity provision is very important to Uniswap Protocol, so it’s important to also look at the sum of assets deposited in liquidity pools by airdrop recipients.\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1052639/1811756/3399333e-2032-4dbf-aad0-8735e34851e6?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1052639/1811756/3399333e-2032-4dbf-aad0-8735e34851e6?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1046816/1811718/66a503fc-ede6-4c76-b70d-715b9066d018?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1046816/1811718/66a503fc-ede6-4c76-b70d-715b9066d018?display=iframe)\n\n**\\~$247bn** was deposited by airdrop recipients, that is a lot! There’s also no surprise that the two most deposited assets were **WETH** & **USDC**. Both account for **\\~$211bn** of the total value deposited.\n\n## Section 5: Airdrop Recipients that Received Other Airdrops\n\nIn this section we look at some of the most popular airdrops in the Defi space since the launch of Uniswap’s airdrop and see which of the Uniswap airdrop recipients received these airdrops.\n\n### ENS Airdrop\n\n[Airdrop Info](https://cointelegraph.com/news/early-ethereum-name-service-ens-adopters-rewarded-with-a-hefty-five-figure-airdrop)\n**Date: November, 8th, 2021.**\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828837/b23af0dd-f2e9-4521-94e0-c97116dc3012?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828837/b23af0dd-f2e9-4521-94e0-c97116dc3012?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828839/56a720b6-e5c6-40d2-8263-84c1b0ca79d4?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828839/56a720b6-e5c6-40d2-8263-84c1b0ca79d4?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828841/d3dc22d4-8407-433d-9d7b-fd6bfff583b6?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828841/d3dc22d4-8407-433d-9d7b-fd6bfff583b6?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828845/3172aed2-3a8e-44ed-a83e-cd60a19c974c?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828845/3172aed2-3a8e-44ed-a83e-cd60a19c974c?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828851/fb1f9217-dd2d-48d1-a265-def9a6ae4b1e?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828851/fb1f9217-dd2d-48d1-a265-def9a6ae4b1e?display=iframe)\n\nFull dashboard [here](https://dune.com/Henrystats/uniswap-2020-airdop-recipients).", "timestamp": 1658279514, "digest": "jsNVzaVx-3BkqmdHR_VPwsjR0JZD0nUwa-2tf7zDXdU", "contributor": "0xe5fF2C80759db9408dC9fD22b155b851Cd5aAA94"}

Joke, ale tak należy rozumieć zk.money i stojące za tym zkSNARK bo coś w tym jest 😜\n\n \n Od razu napiszę, że nie mam się za znachora w tym temacie. Napiszę to co wiem ✌️Postaram się pisać językiem, abyś mnie zrozumiał/a.  \n Jest to też potencjalna spekulacja. Większość osób ma oczy skierowane w kierunku **#StarkNet**. A Popek obserwuję podobne protokoły, które mają mniejszy socialhype, a zarazem fajnie się rozwijają - no i tokena brak. Dlatego dziś będzie o zk.money, a nie o StarkNet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2K-1MxaAX1hUd0dQuMUUs.png?height=607&width=1694)\n\n## zk.money - warstwa 2 na ETH skupiona na prywatności 👀\n\n**[zk.money](https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork)** to *dApps* do ochrony prywatności w warstwie 2 umożliwiający użytkownikom prywatne przesyłanie **$ETH, $DAI & $renBTC** ( renBTC *był w v1 ale v2 obecnie off - wróci imo*). Zk.Money jest zbudowane na silniku [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) (*Zk-Rollup na Eth)* w technologi zkSNARK . Aztec jest porównywalny do [zkSync](https://medium.com/@CalendarDefi/airdrop-guide-zksync-zigzag-a83ef3b33b70), ale koncentruje się na prywatności, której w zkSync brak. Więcej o ich wizji przeczytasz [tutaj](https://aztec.network/vision).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XME4s721Yez0zhziC8YLK.png?height=891&width=2545)\n\n**Podam prosty przykład anonimowej wysyłki $ETH aby Ci to bardziej zobrazować:**\n\n* **Deponujesz** *(shield) *$ETH **lub** $DAI z mainetu na **zk-money L2 \n **\n* Znając **alias *(login)*** drugiej osoby wysyłasz jej $ETH lub $Dai po L2 (sobie, delerowi, whatever). Koszt transakcji bardzo niski (L2). Dzięki technologi **zero-knowledge proof** druga strona otrzyma ETH, ale nadawca nie będzie znany.  \n Co ciekawsze ty jako wysyłający masz dostęp do potwierdzenia, że transakcja pochodzi od Ciebie (gdyby zaszła taka potrzeba to, to potwierdzisz).  \n **Nikt inny nie ma do tego dostępu bez twojego walletu!**  \n \n* Gdy zamiast aliasu odbiorcy podasz adres ethereum środki zostaną wysłane na mainet. I ten przykład w moim przypadku ma utility w kwestiach spekulacji na multiwalletach. Wiesz sybil i te sprawy. Czaisz, prawda? Ahhh, jak ja dużo Ci mówię…🤫\n\n## Dobra skończ pie\\*\\*\\* Popku, przejdź do konkretów i mów co to, i po co mi to? 🤫\n\n[Zk.Money](https://zk.money/) i sieć [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) działają już na mainecie. Ani jedno, ani drugie nie ma jeszcze tokena. Czy będzie ? Czas pokaże. Ja obserwuje i klikam bo jara mnie ta technologia. Uważam, że *Satoshi Nakamoto* byłby dumny z tego z tej technologii. Jak ktoś podchodzi do tematu czysto spekulacyjnie to uważam, że jest teraz na to dobry czas. Dlaczego? Niedawno przeszli na mainet. Ruski gas od Vitalika, też nie taki straszny, jak straszą nas w mediach głównego ścieku 🤮\n\n### Sounds good? Dobra klikamy… 🤔\n\nNa początek musisz wejść na [zk.money](https://zk.money/signup) połączyć portfel (np. Metamask) i stworzyć swój alias *(nick)*. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2WIEKnA3MGihB0EOc2p8B.png?height=993&width=1635)\n\nNastępnie podpisać kilka transakcji i go zarejestrować, po czym zdeponować minimum **0.01 ETH** w celu aktywacji konta.  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MB-G30l7eZtNDojkifd3f.png?height=2151&width=3117)\n\n**Włalaaaa - Done!** Masz już swój alias i interakcje z kontraktem. Wen drop? Za co drop? Trudno wyczuć… A więc czytaj dalej ziom, to zwiększy twoją szansę. \n  \n **UWAGA!** Zapisz swój alias bo gdy go utracisz -- **utracisz swoje środki**.  \n W zk.money **.v1** gdy nie pamiętaliśmy swojego aliasu można było wygenerować nowy. W **.v2** jest to niemożliwe! \n  \n Warto pójść o krok dalej i popatrzyć co protokół ma nam do zaoferowania. \n **Zk.Money V1** oferowało nam jedynie przesyłanie ETH, DAI i renBTC pomiędzy walletami L2 & Mainet. Team postanowił pójść o krok dalej. Obecnie rozwijają private-defi, aby na warstwie drugiej poza zwykłym ‘anonimowym’ przesyłaniem wartości dostępne były swapy, stakinngi i inne bajery, które znamy z DEFI. Zaczeli z [LIDO](https://lido.fi/) (staking ETH dla ETH 2.0) - obecnie *4,38% APY*. Druga opcja, która już jest wdrożona to staking DAI w współpracy z [ElementFi](https://www.element.fi/) . Znaleść to możemy w zakładce [EARN](https://zk.money/earn). Warto to przeklikać i wrzucić coś ETH do LIDO czy trochę DAI do ElementFi na staking. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rS8YpDbaq0A3Kk8agtL7f.png?height=1188&width=2513)\n\n## 👇 Kolejne protokoły soooon ser 👇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i7DBEBz3n4o8U91Qs04DG.png?height=810&width=2494)\n\n## Co jeszcze warto zrobić?\n\n* Warto przerzucić assety z L2 na Mainet. Aby to zrobić przy wysyłce zamiast aliasu należy wkleić adres ETH *\\[0x…\\] \n *\n* Warto też przesłać asset po sieci L2. Aby to zrobić należy wkleić nie adres ETH, a alias odbiorcy. Możesz ‘posypać’ Popusiowi. Ahh, jak to słodko brzmi 😂 \n Anyway, jak podoba Ci się, to co robię i tak bardzo chcesz - mój login masz na screenach wyżej. Donate & spekulacja 2w1. Opcjonalnie możesz wysłać sobie na drugi wallet. I do tego zachęcam. Popek nie żebrak o_0  \n \n* Jeśli interesuje Cię temat, warto dołączyć do nich na [Discord](https://discord.gg/DePA3Uvd) i się troszkę poudzielać. Może w przyszłości będą jakieś role? A może drop na podstawie napisanych znaków na ich discordzie tak jak to było chociażby na Lyra.Finance (optimism). Tak - tak było. Sam się na to załapałem i wpadło sympatycznie 😉\n\n### UWAGA!\n\n> Co do oficjalnej informacji o *#airdrop*.  Team nic takiego nie potwierdził.  \n Nie potwierdzili też tego, że kiedykolwiek powstanie token. Dodam, że większość potwierdzonych dropów wychodziła słabo. Zgodzisz się ze mną? \n *“…Cicha woda brzegi rwie!”*\n\nNa koniec jeszcze jedna uwaga. Jeśli obserwujesz mnie dłużej to pewnie o zk.money już wiesz i bawiłeś się tam już na v1. Jeśli tak to zaloguj się na [old.zk.money](https://old.zk.money/) i przenieś swoje assety na L1 po czym dokonaj ponownej migracji na L2 tworząc nowy alias.

{"id": "lv9__ZCL2e7SxFqwJ8kCqPxaeAtWOnL4GJ-wuCvrlDA", "title": "Reveel - Manifesto", "body": "*Introducing [Reveel](https://www.r3vl.xyz/), the financial stack for Web3 collaboration.*\n\n## The Future of Collaboration\n\nThe crypto movement, since its very beginning, has aimed to disrupt industries by shifting the balance of power back from intermediaries to end users.\n\nAs Web3 has emerged, artists, creative entrepreneurs, and builders - we’ll call them creators - have been drawn to this technology for that very reason. Indeed, this creative class has long been on the short end of the stick, subject to gatekeepers & centralized platforms that capture a vast portion of the value created by their art, their content, and their business.\n\nDecentralization & ownership, the core principles of Web3, offer these creators new opportunities to develop, manage, and monetize their work & their communities.\n\nThese principles also offer new ways to collaborate. When ideas, talent, and resources are distributed, new and more fluid collectives surface to deliver on projects. Similarly, **when ownership is pushed to the edges of the network, to its users, collaboration becomes shared property. And shared interest becomes shared equity**.\n\nBut the blockchain is still a nascent technology and its adoption by creators still requires an advanced level of technical knowledge which greatly reduces accessibility to Web3. For the technology to facilitate collaboration & deliver on its promise to creators, many building blocks still need to be developed.\n\nOne of those building blocks is a financial stack that supports the shift towards this new way of working together and offers creators a fluid revenue sharing & revenue management solution. **A building block to unleash Web3 collaboration**.\n\n## Reveel\n\nWe’ve started **[Reveel](https://www.r3vl.xyz/)** to create that building block.\n\nAt its core, Reveel strives to become a financial layer for collaboration in Web3 - **the financial stack for Web3 collaboration** - and a bedrock for creators to grow upon.\n\nWe understand that collaboration can generate friction: How do creators identify partnership opportunities? How and when do collaborators get paid? How do collectives define & monitor success?\n\nWe believe **transparency & equity** are the fundamental pillars that will enable products to solve these challenges & deliver on the promise to make collaboration simpler. This is why Reveel is building a platform that helps creators visualize and understand their on-chain income & automate the distribution of revenue amongst collaborators, rights holders, and partners.  \n In other words, Reveel is built for creators, artists, builders & brands that generate revenue on-chain and want to have more time to focus on what they do best: create.\n\nWith the support of our amazing backers, including [Binance Labs](https://labs.binance.com/) & [Moment Ventures](https://www.momentventures.com/), we’ve been able to bring together a rockstar team of seasoned Web3 developers, experienced venture builders & international touring artists, to deliver on our vision.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y4Pwd71qYD9glaxusaxf5.png?height=994&width=1705)\n\n## Announcing Reveel (v0.1)\n\nOur team is excited to announce that we are rolling out the first iteration of the platform: **[Reveel v0.1](https://app.r3vl.xyz/)**.\n\nOur initial beta includes a Revenue Share Protocol and a suite of Creator Analytics tools.\n\nThe **Revenue Share Protocol** allows creators to design & deploy their own Revenue Path (revenue share smart contract) in order to automatically split on-chain revenue with collaborators. The protocol has been implemented in a trustless, gas-efficient, and fully decentralized way. Funds can be sent to a Revenue Path and any listed recipient can withdraw their share of funds at any time, without the approval or action of any other collaborator on the smart contract, thus simplifying the revenue management aspect of collaboration.\n\nThe **Creator Analytics** offers the very first NFT analytics tool designed not just for collectors, but also for the creators themselves. Creators can track their entire catalog of NFT drops, compare their performance & draw valuable insights that guide their decision-making for future releases. Additionally, Creator Analytics allows users to track and understand their collector base, segment holders based on a variety of filters, and download collector lists. With this, Reveel allows creators to better understand how their revenue is generated and what projects & collaborations help them grow their community & their income.\n\nAs we launch Reveel, we’re fortunate to have outstanding partners, such as [Venice Music](https://www.venicemusic.co/), [Glass.xyz](https://glass.xyz/), [wavWRLD](https://wavwrld.com/), [BlackDave](https://blackdaveblackdave.com/), [Sammy Arriaga](https://sammynft.com/) and many more, who are pushing the boundaries of what it means to create & collaborate in Web3.\n\n## Join Us\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more, would like to get involved, or have a need for what we’re building, we encourage you to [reach out](http://discord.gg/r3vl).\n\nOur current version of the Revenue Share Protocol (v0.1) is in open beta and is totally free to use.

{"id": "VXVVsN3LzHp2NNxAifUZQCM-w0V5eAekw7AOdGEU9x8", "title": "Web3: Narratives of Disruption", "body": "Instead of pursuing a false debate on whether this next-generation technology should be centralized or decentralized, we should ask how best can we arrange the narrative for desirable decentralization. This engaging narrative is constructed by making the mission and objectives among Web3 platforms more about coordination. In turn, this will create a space that allows individuals to maintain ownership and autonomy of the internet and its foundations. This is not some kind of freakish fiction but rather a reality of what is possible in today's Web3 repository. Through innovative technologies (NFT platforms, currency exchange, and wallet providers) in tandem with people-powered initiatives, Web3 is blossoming into a system of efficiently solving the problem found in centralized systems. Allowing self-sovereign identities their right for communication, privacy, and governance, but that doesn't come without its obstacles.\n\n**Objective / Disclaimer**\n\nWeb3 is unfolding into new territories daily, building communities to find each other, holding themselves accountable towards the same mission and connecting with others. As a disclaimer to you reading this post, I am not an expert. I am naturally a researcher and enthusiast of the possibilities behind Web3 and decentralized narratives. I hope that by the time you finish reading this, you feel more familiar with Web3 and how decentralization plays a crucial role in facilitating the new narratives of what the internet was always meant to serve. I also strongly encourage everyone to always do as a motto states and \"Do your own research\" (DYOR) as a practice.\n\n**Pre-requisite**\n\nLet's start with Web1, which started around the early 90s, a version of the internet that was a space where consumers were primarily users on an open network of information (the read-only era). What Web1 had was many barriers to entry because of how technical the user experience was, which excluded the majority from using the internet. Leading us into the Web2 age, the centralization age came in with fewer barriers to entry due to big tech platforms such as Yahoo and Google who provided us with excellent user experience interfaces. This grew the consumer demand at scale. Most of us use this version today, where the primary focus is targeted advertisements and lack of privacy heralded by the arrival of social media. The Web2 internet we know today has needed the reliance on centralized intermediaries (Google, Meta, Amazon).\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nThe main principle of Web3 is decentralization. Rather than being controlled by Big Tech, governments, financial institutions, or large corporations, it's entirely run by a community of individuals seeking to make a difference to combat our current Web2 form. This Web2 form has been governed by addictive, abrasive, and controlling narratives that I believe users are fed up with. Now, the technology underpinning Web3 makes it possible for far more inventive open-source and decentralized systems to be created — and enables decentralized economies (based on Blockchain systems that incentivize the stakeholders, developers, contributors, and consumers alike) to form around them. When this happens successfully will enable the products and services of Web3 to compete with and eventually surpass those of Web2.\n\n**Opportunity**\n\nCreatives now have an opportunity to leverage this technology and set it up to become a significant driver of economic growth. This can alter the workforce economy into new realms of possibility to significantly impact how we operate as a society (think about how DAOs, NFTs, and the Metaverse can help play this out?!). This is where I find the most utopic possibility in Web3, where the creator economy and the workforce collide. Bringing artists, lawyers, developers, and creators together from around the globe to create ideas and monetize them globally in permissionless crypto-economic systems— and essentially defining the future of work.\n\n**Value Creation**\n\nIdeas and community contributions of working toward a shared goal that gains value over time (through individuals who feed that value creation) are gaining momentum in various social communities (Friends with benefits, Forefront, and Party DAO). A concept that results in an ecosystem of equity that doesn't exclude the niche. The governing principle behind Web 3 takes us back to the idea we spoke about at the start of this post around Web1 which was the first version of open-source visions, so we are right back where we started. In a space filled with skeptics, naysayers, and the uninterested, my advice to you is to find where your area is in Web3 and begin to implement the change you want to see in the future. This isn't going anywhere, nor is it a hoax— It's the early stages of something completely new and has the potential to be shaped by the right set of values.\n\n**Here a list of some fun places to start:**\n\n* <https://decentraland.org/>\n* <https://rabbithole.gg/>\n* <https://rally.io/>\n* <https://mirror.xyz/>\n* <https://dune.com/home>\n* <https://www.radardao.xyz/>\n* <https://chain.link/>\n* <https://forefront.market/feed>\n* <https://www.fwb.help/>\n* <https://party.mirror.xyz/>\n* <https://gitcoin.co/>\n* <https://flamingodao.xyz/>\n* <https://snapshot.org/#/>\n* <https://rabbithole.gg/>\n\nImage Credit: Vinicius Costa", "timestamp": 1658278778, "digest": "tcg278vcmkUq-1bzAZ7uTd5iSRWs3WlDqXN-p3B5RHQ", "contributor": "0xF1F144271438B53c38Bc502D804878D7b295e563"}

{"id": "MEvvpfcIdxAA5F5W7mkwgYY6-mXysk8o712s2At35sY", "title": "Milady Poem", "body": "There was a really bad month where Tomaszo stayed up late after his wife went to bed every night. He would listen to podcasts and play a skateboarding video game. He often used a cell phone application called Twitter to view and recommend to others a diverse array of ironic, cynical, sarcastically violent, earnestly violent, and/or politically extreme media that leveraged characters and stylistic themes/imagery from Japanese animation, low-resolution still shots and promotional material from outdated computer games, and assorted iconography, turns of phrase, and/or images appropriated from disparate internet communities of which he was sometimes a member and sometimes an outsider. But he also used the cell phone application to communicate his earnest thoughts and feelings so that people on the internet could console him in his paranoid schizophrenia or talk him down during bad episodes of autism.\n\nHe tweeted about how he felt this strange detachment and someone sent him a Twitter dm saying he was probably having a dissociative episode and that even though it happens to people sometimes, he shouldn’t tweet about it, because of how employers and family and whoever else can see his tweets and might do something that would make his life worse, like send him to a psychiatric hospital or prevent him from getting a different job. He thanked the person, deleted the tweet, and read most of the “dissociative disorder” article on Wikipedia.\n\nHe unpaused the skateboarding game. He dissociated some more. He had a hard time playing the game but liked having a word for what was happening. He paused the game. He looked at Twitter. He saw a brand entity icon account, @milady, post a joke about video games. Tomaszo replied to the @Milady account with a funny joke death threat. The @milady account was verified on Twitter. Tomaszo looked up how to be verified on Twitter. The verification process required a photo identification and filling out bureaucratic-seeming forms; it didn’t seem to make any sense for a brand to be verified on Twitter. Tomaszo deleted his death threat because he knew it was low-value, violent speech that wasn’t protectable under the First Amendment. Tomaszo then tweeted at the @milady account to ask if it had photo identification. The @milady account quote-tweeted Tomaszo’s tweet alongside a photo of a man being stabbed in the neck. The picture seemed real and was exceptionally graphic. There was blood and the beginnings of a gaping wound. The @milady account called Tomaszo a dumb piece of shit in the quote-tweet. Tomaszo liked the threatening and violent tweet out of a vague hope that it would defuse things. He unpaused his skateboarding game and worriedly played for seventeen minutes.\n\nHe paused the game and checked Twitter and saw that the @milady account’s quote-tweet had been deleted. The @milady account had tweeted an apology about being hacked. The apology had several thousand likes. Tomaszo received a dm from the @milady account. The @milady account called him a *little bitch.* The @milady account sent another dm calling him a *fucking narc*. The @milady account sent another dm with a picture of the man being stabbed in the neck. It looked like the same man from the first photo being stabbed for a second time.

When the two children were young, they watched the children for me, the old lady worked in the fields, and I often took the children to help. I deal with the elderly every day, and have established a very close relationship between day and night. I am fortunate to have learned important life lessons from the elderly while living happily.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uNCYYhvelt3Jvq4eJHXTH.png?height=270&width=415)\n\nAlways fill the bowl and return it\n\nThe old landlord, the old man, broke down two years ago, and now he lives in a nursing home. The old lady is the only one left at home. Thinking that it is inconvenient for the old man to be alone, I have to give a bowl of delicious food to the old lady. The old lady always accepted it happily. Two days later, she came to the door and returned the bowl to thank it. The bowl was always full. Sometimes it's the blueberries she harvests, sometimes it's chocolate for the kids, sometimes it's two snacks, but she never returns an empty bowl. The old lady never talked about her philosophy of life, but she told me with her actions: it is not enough to accept the benefits of others, and it is not enough to say thanks with your mouth, you must return it in kind, even if it is a small thing that is not valuabl\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7laxPH1vEuvkw_r26bsE3.png?height=273&width=409)\n\ne.\n\nToday's affairs will never be postponed until tomorrow\n\nEver since I met the old lady landlord, I thought she was very busy. As many people come to her every day, there are as many things to do, so whenever something in the house breaks and needs to be repaired, I am embarrassed. But as long as I mustered up the courage to speak, the old lady immediately put down what she was doing, and immediately contacted me to fix it. No matter how troublesome, no matter how much it costs, the old lady never procrastinates. Maybe she knew that feeling distressed for the current little money, or putting the problem aside for a while, would only make things worse. Unpleasant things have to be resolved immediately, the longer the delay, the harder it is to do.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IMYRuL07jaMTvESzIWJJG.png?height=270&width=417)\n\nLive and learnIn Japanese Shinto, the green leaves of the camellia family are used for decoration. The old couple planted a lot of these trees back then, and the leaves sold better than the flowers. Although this kind of business has long been discontinued, some shrines still like to ask for his family due to the good reputation they have accumulated in the past. The old lady took the call from the shrine and went to the mountain to chop branches, and then brought them back with a small truck to trim them in her garage. The old lady felt that it was a waste of time to do this work for several hours. So, she bought a CD that reads Japanese classical literature aloud and listened to it while pruning branches. Our whole family was shocked when the soft female voice echoed in the garage for the first time. The old lady who graduated from junior high school has been doing farm work all her life, and has been a big landowner for most of her life. She has a million-dollar family property. Nearly 80 years old, she is still doing farm work in the garage while listening to classical literature recitations. Continuing to learn will not make her richer, but it will make her more spiritual.", "timestamp": 1658280021, "digest": "J7h4gpaMbld9wQbZS7lMUG2winwKuAw4KbWTDRJxMy0", "contributor": "0x14bd6177124529E8409993fBf08DDB0702695730"}
{"id": "NaQvfrDkXswSt-ajwXTHI5NcOis2JfvyNO5ZsJFl0i0", "title": "I am a little goldfish", "body": "I am a little goldfish. If you really want to know how small it is, it may only be five centimeters with a ruler. I don't know where I came from, let alone what my mother looked like. For as long as I can remember, I have lived in a transparent glass tank with goldfish of various sizes and colors. The man who has passed the age of confusion sprinkles some fine powdery things into the fish tank every day. We all know that it is food. This is not because our noses are sensitive enough, but experience and habits tell us. We, in addition to eating, will never have any other surprises. At this moment, my companions and I opened our mouths and swam towards the food with lightning speed. Everyone has to go all out to try to eat more, because if we didn't eat today, we have to wait until tomorrow, which is too long for our stomachs. I don't know who spread the public opinion that goldfish can only be eaten once a day, and only a small amount, otherwise it will die. Alas, no communication is really scary. These grotesque antics always starve us, so we scrambled for less than 10 seconds. It is said that human beings cannot afford to hurt because of money, then our goldfish destroys harmony because of food.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c6ATycOZw_E421crU1QH0.png?height=266&width=435)\n\nWe had a leisurely life, but we had no bigger places to go, and I often longed for vast freedoms. If possible, I would like to fight for freedom. The funny thing is that although we are weak, we cannot find a strong enemy.\n\nEvery day when I see pedestrians hurried by, I have such a show of self-comfort in my heart: Although I don't have the freedom of your human beings, I have free food to eat, don't worry about where to live. At this time, I can finally find a sense of superiority in being a goldfish. Of course, if anyone disdains my sense of superiority, it means that you haven't realized the difficulty of this accommodation. Go and watch the BBC documentary, after watching it, you will know how difficult it is to have a meal these days, and how difficult it is to have a nest.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wpiEjr1rfcAncfNIV5eaL.png?height=266&width=450)\n\nI look happy every day, but I also have my own sadness. Every time I see my companions who have lived and played together leave, no one can see the sadness in my eyes, at least I know that humans are invisible, because they all leave with undisguised joy. But slowly I also accepted this separation, the old companion left, the new companion came, and so on. To be honest, when those goldfish were taken away one by one, in addition to being sad, I also flashed some despicable joy, but fortunately I ran fast and was not caught.\n\nThe days are just like this, when I eat comfortably and swim freely every day, it slips away quietly. One day when I was wandering around, I suddenly found that there were fewer and fewer goldfishes I was familiar with, and I realized that I had been in this fish tank for more than half a year. I suddenly wondered what life was going on for the goldfish that was taken away? And why did you stay here for so long? Is it a lucky escape every time, or are those people who don't want to take me away because I'm not pretty? I always thought it was the former. OMG! Am I not pretty? I never thought about this question. I immediately turned around a few times, and the surroundings were transparent, so I couldn't see myself. If it's really because I'm ugly that I've been kept here forever, then the joy of every escape before has become the biggest irony now.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9ylFc5S7PL5blZwZEFTGH.png?height=279&width=448)\n\nWhen someone came to pick goldfish again, I swam hard and jumped up happily. Once I was finally lucky enough to be caught, only to be brushed down mercilessly, and I was embarrassed at the time. After being eliminated again and again, I realized that I am an ornamental goldfish. My value is that humans bring me home, and when they see me, they are pleasant to the eyes and in a good mood. I hate myself for not thinking about this before.\n\nIt seems that my appearance has no advantage, and I am trapped in a pile of fish. Everyone has their own characteristics. How can I leave this place and reflect my value? I realized I couldn't stay here for comfort anymore, because no one would ever appreciate me here. To think of new places to go, I have to put in more effort than any other goldfish.\n\nTo say that in the past, I was swimming lazily, but now I am swimming happily. I want to find my strengths, I don't have a good appearance, but I want to have a healthy body. Slowly I found myself with a new skill, and that is when I hold my head up and blow bubbles with my head up, my mouth can make a loud noise, I think the strings of bubbles are matched with This voice should make me look spirited and cute. This is something that other goldfish can't do, and I snickered. Waiting quietly for the arrival of the new owner.\n\nBut a few days later, I'm still here.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hqPccJ0VqSIi9NmPpW583.png?height=279&width=448)\n\nAt this moment, a mother and a five-year-old boy came to the fish tank. The mother lets her child choose their favorite goldfish. I looked at this little boy: white skin, smooth and full forehead, big eyes focused and focused, the yellow shirt and blue plaid shorts made him more beautiful and cute. I fell in love with him right away and swam to the front without hesitation. The little boy looked left and right, not knowing which one to choose. I knew it was time to give full play to my special talents. Sure enough, the little boy picked me up decisively after seeing my performance. Maybe he was too excited. When I was just picked up, his hand shook and I was thrown to the ground mercilessly. After I got out of the water and fell, I couldn't breathe like I had asthma, and I was dying on the ground. Fortunately, the little boy picked me up immediately and put me in the water bag that the man had already prepared. I took a deep breath, and I never thought the water tasted so good. At this time, the child's mother said: \"No, I just fell to the ground, and I'm sure it won't last long. Let's pick another one!\" The little boy said: No, I want this one, who said it wouldn't live long, look how well it swims! You can blow bubbles when you fall on the ground!", "timestamp": 1658280562, "digest": "lDsj-MUk8ucck5a_PAdkXGWQbEbttU4_CB4q9OrSJxM", "contributor": "0x14bd6177124529E8409993fBf08DDB0702695730"}

{"id": "D3eQYnlQiTD6Pwt0yqhaKa0LaOZ59SI-FWcD7FFUJ30", "title": "Ability to manage emotions", "body": "There is such a young man who is irritable by nature and has difficulty controlling his emotions. His old father asked his son that if he could not control his emotions in the future, he would fix a nail on the wall in the backyard and wait for his emotions to stabilize. Pull the nail out again. So the young man followed his father's instructions. At first, he even set 30 nails a day, but every time the young man pulled out the nails, he deeply felt that the process of pulling out the nails required more effort than the act of setting the nails. Several times, so, the guy slowly began to reduce the chance of nailing, gradually, from 30 nails per day to 15, until he stopped going to the backyard to set nails for several days. Later, the old father brought the young man to the backyard and pointed to the wall board that was full of savage people. When he was out of control, the words he said were like putting nails in the heart. Even if the nails were pulled out, the scars would still be hard to recover.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QskrKJK5WtLCJvdzFJSq6.png?height=282&width=453)\n\nI vaguely remember that the story was described in this way. It is fortunate that the young man has such a wise old father, who can use such a vivid method to let his son realize the true meaning of it. Thankfully again, I saw a story that made me and the guy in the story feel the importance of emotional management. If you are angry for one minute, you will lose 60 seconds of your happy life; what you say and do when you lose your mind will make you regret immediately; a high education is a threshold for you to enter the workplace, but high emotional intelligence can help you do well in the workplace . And so on similar words are all telling us that emotional management it is important.\n\nYour ability to manage emotions is actually the quotient of your emotional management, commonly known as emotional intelligence. Expert research has pointed out that the difference between EQ and IQ is that a large part of IQ comes from heredity, and there is little chance of acquired change, but EQ can be improved through the guidance and efforts of others, so there is so much management. Learn from experts to study emotion management, and there are so many people who are looking forward to success in emotion management who don’t hesitate to take a related course.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lkeq7n9p26iXtmy6iJw48.png?height=270&width=412)\n\nSo based on the improvement of my emotional management ability, I have consulted quite a few books, and now I will share with you what I have gained.\n\nEnter the word \"emotion\" into Baidu, and there is such an explanation \"it is a reaction to the environment\". Faced with the same environment, such as a rainy day, different people will have different emotional experiences: those who meet to go out to play will feel disappointed, and farmers who are worried that the drought will affect their harvest will feel lucky. The key to different reactions is that people are different, so emotions are actually just a subjective reaction of people to the internal and external environment. Many times, the uncomfortable physiological reactions that emotions bring to us and the adverse consequences of their actions will make us feel that some emotions are bad. Yes, it is not. Emotions are neither good or bad, but a subjective reaction of us.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ogTUAbxRVOhUE-8K8spy7.png?height=276&width=442)\n\nBy analogy, it is not difficult to see from the definition of emotional management \"the management of your own reactions to the environment\" that the key to good emotional management lies in yourself, because it is a management of your own reactions, so It is said that you have 100% control over emotional management, and it depends on you, not on others. Many times, we often hear someone complaining after losing control of their emotions, \"If it wasn't for his attitude, I wouldn't have such impulsive actions.\" In fact, this sentence is just to find a reason for our loss of control. The remote control of management has always been in our own hands. Once you have a request for the response of the other party, you will unconditionally hand over the remote control of your emotions to the other party, so it is inevitable to lose control.\n\nThe colorful colors are derived from the three primary colors of red, green and blue. Although there are hundreds of expressions of emotions, they can be summarized into four basic emotions: joy, anger, sorrow, and fear.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cb94OE6aGjZbFDKfMh7v1.png?height=289&width=303)\n\nJoy and sadness are a pair of opposite emotions. When people achieve their desired goals and relieve tension and anxiety, the feeling of comfort is the emotional experience of joy; sadness is the emotional experience after the loss of the desired goal. Anger and fear are another pair of opposing emotions; usually when a person encounters an unpleasant thing, our autonomic nervous system will produce a flight or fight response, and when the opponent we encounter is stronger than us, we will take flight. , which is the emotional experience of fear; and when the other party is weaker than us, we will have war, which is the emotional experience of anger. Taking cats and mice as an example, an adult cat has 500 experience points for catching mice, and a weak mouse has 50 experience points against cats, so such a cat will immediately take an offensive stance; another cat has 100 experience points to fight against a cat. The mouse experience value is 150, then the cat may choose to avoid it; there is another cat with 300 experience value, and the mouse experience value of the battle is 250, then we will see the cat keep slapping the mouse with its paws , keep slapping until the mouse escapes without panting before attacking and winning. In our opinion, the third cat is playing with the mouse. If the third cat is injected with a tranquilizer, then this 300 experience is worth the cat will immediately Attack the mouse with 250 experience points, because the cat is slapping like this because it's scared. This is also understandable why drivers tend to lose control of their tempers. They can yell and make insulting gestures in the car when the traffic is not smooth. In fact, this is because people feel safe and fearless in the car, regardless of the situation.

Founder Anthony Scaramucci confirmed the move July 19 in an interview on CNBC, after Bloomberg reported it a day earlier citing anonymous sources. \n\n“Our board made the decision to temporarily suspend until we can raise capital inside the fund,” Scaramucci told CNBC. “The fund is unlevered, so there’s definitely no fear of any liquidation whatsoever and about 18% of the fund is in what we would call crypto exposure.” An independent board also took art in the decision, Scaramucci said.\n\nScaramucci mentioned Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) and FTX stock as examples of the fund’s crypto exposure. Among other crypto-related companies listed as investments on the Skybridge website, not specifically linked to Legion Strategies, are Kraken, NYDIG, Helium, Lightning and Genesis Digital Assets. Scaramucci said the Legion Strategies fund was down 30% year-to-date, but up 5% in July.\n\nLegion Strategies is an offshore fund based in the Cayman Islands that has about $250 million in it, according to Scaramucci. It is one of the smaller funds run by the company. This was the first time the fund had been suspended since its founding in 1994. Skybridge itself was founded in 2005.\n\nScaramucci told CNBC:\n\n> “Everybody signed an investor agreement, this type of flexibility, so I don’t think there are any surprises here given what’s going on in the overall market.”\n\nSkybridge is among the financial services companies that have [applied to list a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-rejects-skybridge-s-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf)and been rejected by the United Sates Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n***Related: [Scaramucci sees bright future for crypto but ‘very worried’ about US politicians](https://cointelegraph.com/news/scaramucci-sees-bright-future-for-crypto-but-very-worried-about-us-politicians)***\n\nSkybridge made its first investments in Bitcoin in late 2020 and announced in April that [it was repositioning itself](https://cointelegraph.com/news/skybridge-goes-all-in-on-crypto-betting-on-tremendous-growth-ahead) to “eventually be a leading cryptocurrency asset manager and adviser.”", "timestamp": 1658282254, "digest": "vNtp_nUr4E5dFGfYZAI2t3ExiJpkGJMPzbrVNetiXnY", "contributor": "0x43BB172927116E0E5713A957A581E621762AEe2C"}

Under Bian Que's meticulous care, their illnesses recovered in no time. However, Bian Que said to Gong Hu and Qi Ying, \"The diseases you both sought to treat in the past were caused by the intrusion of pathogens from outside the body into the internal organs, so only medicine and acupuncture can solve the problem. God, I found out that there is still a disease lurking in you. It was brought out of your mother's womb and grew along with your body's development. This disease is very dangerous. I would like to treat you again, how about it?\"\nGong Hu and Qi Ying replied, \"We want to hear about the symptoms of this disease, and then make a decision.\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/22Axqee-imUpjpraoVcpN.png?height=270&width=232)\n\n\nTherefore, Bian Que first said to Gong Hu: \"You have lofty ambitions, and you are good at thinking about problems. You can have many ways to deal with problems, but unfortunately, your temperament is relatively weak, and you are often indecisive, hesitant, and lost at critical moments. Good opportunity.\" Then, he turned to Qi Ying: \"What about you? It's the exact opposite of Gong Hu. You lack long-term plans for the future, your thoughts are relatively simple, but your temperament is very strong, and you don't think much about others, but you like to act arbitrarily. Finally, Bian Que said to the two of them: \"Now if I exchange your hearts, you will all be perfect.\"\nAfter listening to Bian Que's analysis, Gong Hu and Qi Ying were both willing to undergo a heart transplant. So, Bian Que made them both drink a kind of narcotic wine, causing them to fall into a coma and not wake up for three days. During this time, Bian Que opened their chests, took out their hearts, and exchanged them. After the operation, the magic medicine was applied to the wound, and when they recovered, they were still as healthy and strong as before the operation. After they said goodbye to Bian Que together, they went home separately.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Ei0IzueyAUdja31wQY50.png?height=276&width=330)\n\n\nHowever, because the hearts have been exchanged, Gong Hu returned to Qi Ying's house, and Qi Ying returned to Gong Hu's house. The wives and children of the two families did not know the people who came home, so they all quarreled. Gong Hu and Qi Ying couldn't think of it, so they had to ask Bian Que to explain. Bian Que told the two families the whole story, so that the quarrel could be put to rest.\nThis fable is borrowing the name of the genius doctor Bian Que, using the metaphor of heart-changing, to show that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.

Persistence 团队将与 Keplr、Cosmostation、Coin98 和 Citadel 等钱包团队通力合作，以确保 Persistence Core-1 链的新用户仅注册到代币类型 118。 \n\n   b. 我们将为现有用户提供接口，方便现有用户在与应用和链的交互中继续使用代币类型 750，直到用户迁移到代币类型 118。\n\n   c. 进行与代币类型以及迁移至 118 相关的推广教育。\n2. 在用户端进行从代币类型 750 至代币类型 118 的迁移：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZIB4wp7h9J0mYv3AWhEJh.png?height=813&width=2048)\n\n1. 新用户：无需任何操作 \n2. 现有网页端/手机端钱包用户： \n\n   \\-代币类型118用户：无需操作 \n\n   \\-代币类型750用户：创建一个新钱包并将您的代币迁移到新创建的钱包中 \n3. Ledger 用户：迁移到 Cosmos 应用程序 -代币类型118 \n4. 质押 XPRT 的用户： \n\n   \\-迁移建议：在 Iqlusion 上线流动性质押模块后（暂定2022年第三季度末），无需解除质押即可直接将质押代币转移至新的代币类型118钱包地址。 \n\n   \\-即时解决方案：将您的 XPRT 解除质押并迁移到新创建的代币类型 118 钱包地址。\n\n将代币类型从 750 迁移至 118 的提案一旦通过，在接下来的几个月的迁移期内，团队保证将为无缝迁移提供全部必要的支持及指导。 \n\n同时，Persistence钱包以及合作钱包还将在未来很长一段时间内支持代币类型750，以确保全部用户都顺利迁移至代币类型118。 \n\n**注意:** 我们预计将在2024年12月不再支持代币类型750的钱包。 \n\n代币类型迁移的核心目的是为 Persistence 生态系统成员提供最佳用户体验。随着项目的成熟，我们一直在不断努力提供以用户为核心的产品，而这需要我们不断的进行迭代发展。 \n\n只有在社区、验证者和合作项目的不断反馈、支持和通力合作之下，我们才能实现预定的目标。我们朝着更佳的用户体验前进的每一步都将让我们离成为 PoS 生态系统的流动性质押中心这一目标更进一步。\n\n## 拓展参考资料：\n\n* 衍生路径: <https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/derivation-paths> \n* BIP44 标准: <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki>\n* 代币类型 118: <https://medium.com/chainapsis/keplr-explained-coin-type-118-9781d26b2c4e>\n* IBC 信息面板: <https://mapofzones.com>\n\n**P.S.** 感谢 Chainapsis 团队对代币类型 118 的研究，辅助构建了本篇文章以及相关的关键信息。", "timestamp": 1658282126, "digest": "FtJOMT-OpDk_Gn7rm2_BGoiziJ8qGEvcg8vCcFCXezQ", "contributor": "0xd92b5bd0048dc13469FBE17EdE75Aa5AA91f9296"}

Founder Anthony Scaramucci confirmed the move July 19 in an interview on CNBC, after Bloomberg reported it a day earlier citing anonymous sources. \n\n“Our board made the decision to temporarily suspend until we can raise capital inside the fund,” Scaramucci told CNBC. “The fund is unlevered, so there’s definitely no fear of any liquidation whatsoever and about 18% of the fund is in what we would call crypto exposure.” An independent board also took art in the decision, Scaramucci said.\n\nScaramucci mentioned Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) and FTX stock as examples of the fund’s crypto exposure. Among other crypto-related companies listed as investments on the Skybridge website, not specifically linked to Legion Strategies, are Kraken, NYDIG, Helium, Lightning and Genesis Digital Assets.

{"id": "aojIGZXGkuXmsUIya87m0KJHBMJZUAAZHxwwrnq0ycE", "title": "One tree becomes wood, ten trees become firewood", "body": "In the early 1890s, in Houston, the southern United States, the cotton billionaire William Marshall Rice donated money to establish Rice University, which is one of the earliest private schools in the United States.\n\nWhen the campus was built, Rice stipulated that not a single oak tree on the original site should be moved, and it should be carefully fortified. From the construction of the school to the completion of the school, there are no less oak trees, a total of 689 trees.\n\nAs a result, the school recruited 689 students in the first year.\n\nPeople don't understand. Some people say that Rice has a problem with nerves, because according to the size of the school, it can recruit at least 1,000 students. Private schools, on the other hand, are supported by tuition fees, and there is no difference between a teacher teaching 50 students and 100 students.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9ixZCSeEK4PkrlzE7hSZ0.png?height=270&width=367)\n\nRice continued to ask teachers and students to cultivate oak trees and new oak trees in sections until the campus was \"saturated\". If oak trees are in the way of infrastructure land, oak trees must be transplanted to another part of the campus at any cost, and they must be guaranteed to survive, or enrollment must be reduced accordingly the following year.\n\nIf the enrollment plan for the next year increases, the first thing the school has to do is to plant a corresponding number of oak trees. If unfortunately some do not survive, a corresponding number of students will be unlucky.\n\nAt this time, some people seem to have realized something, while more people are more puzzled, and some people even say that Rice may be an \"oak spirit\".\n\nBy 1902, the campus was finally \"saturated\" with 4,890 oak trees. At this time, Rice, who was seriously ill, made a rule: no matter when, the number of students in the school should not exceed 4,890.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YaSY-tY4jLnOHKz3fw0xD.png?height=270&width=405)\n\nAfter his death, people saw that Rice University became famous and became \"Harvard in the South of the United States\", and people erected a statue for him, \"the supreme pioneer of American private schools\".\n\nUntil 2008, there were 4,890 lush oak trees on the 325-hectare campus, and the total number of students in the school was 4,850, slightly less than the total number of oaks. In public schools, the 325-hectare campus has at least 9,000 students.\n\nMore than 100 years later, no matter how the times change, no matter how the economy develops, the number of students at Rice University is always less than the number of oak trees. There has been no question or objection to Mr Rice's rule.\n\nIn fact, the reason is very simple. Of course, the results of growing one tree in one square meter and growing 10 trees in one square meter are different: one tree becomes wood, and 10 trees become firewood. Regarding the possibility of personalized education for teachers on stage, the teaching effect of a classroom with 20 students and 50 students is of course different.\n\nIt's a simple truth, but there are always too many people who can't imitate it - the truth is also very simple: it is caused by the desire for profit.\n\nRice University only restricts the number of students. For world-class experts and scholars who are interested in teaching, it not only refuses to come, but also takes the initiative to throw \"hydrangea\" to them. The total number of students is less than 5,000, but the total number of teachers exceeds 500, and the teacher-to-student ratio is greater than 1:10.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qV0muijlmghrsjc_6aDcH.png?height=270&width=289)\n\nIn the 2007 U.S. university rankings, from the 1st to the 21st place are all private universities, and only from the 22nd place are public universities. At No. 22 is the public University of California, Berkeley, which is also far from No. 21 in strength.\n\nAccording to the 2010 National University Rankings, Rice University ranked 17th. It is a public university with its close proximity to the University of Texas, but it cannot be compared with Rice University in terms of academic level.\n\nThere are many unchangeable laws in nature.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GUBssrs47m64OD9vU5Bta.png?height=270&width=342)\n\nOn the same piece of land, the oak trees that can thrive are limited, and the number of students a university can accommodate is also limited, breaking the harmony between students, teachers and school-running conditions, the decline of teaching quality and the decline of school reputation will inevitably, eventually It affects the long-term development of the school. In fact, Rice University takes the oak tree as its teacher and follows the objective laws of nature, and longevity is inevitable.", "timestamp": 1658282430, "digest": "rkCNwyrKyi73AXZFqBlVZf8euVFYmAs-RuK0qezFWYU", "contributor": "0x14bd6177124529E8409993fBf08DDB0702695730"}

He has a stable job, but also has his parents who love him. He does not worry about food, clothing, or lack of love. However, he always felt that he had endless troubles, entangled in his heart, unable to break free or escape.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k__liI4CFCrXxRi4cKhrI.png?height=270&width=376)\n\nHow can people be so troubled? Young people are confused. One day, when he met a wise man, he expressed the confusion in his heart, hoping to get enlightenment.\n\nAfter listening to the wise man, he smiled slightly and said, \"The secular world, the wine pond and the meat forest, the human dance in the red dust, the famous locks and the locks, everything is tempting and confusing people. If you want to move, you will be excited, and you will naturally be troubled. Gains and losses, glory and shame, ups and downs... The more you care, the more painful your heart will be; on the contrary, the more you give up, the more peaceful your heart will be. \"Let go\" is to eliminate the root cause of troubles.\n\nThe young man nodded, if he understood something.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BQEGTouCkjVSpp5KsQMFZ.png?height=286&width=460)\n\nAnother day, he met a philanthropist. It is said that the philanthropist once made a lot of money, but then donated the money to others. Now, he lives happily.\n\nThe young man told the philanthropist his confusion again, hoping to get an answer from him.\n\nThe philanthropist said, I have had the same pain as you. However, since I learned to pay attention to others and to love others, the pain in my heart disappeared. Love is really an oar given to us by God, it can ferry us beyond the sea of ​​misery.\n\nA selfish person will not get great pleasures in life. Only those who have love in their hearts can create ripples of infinite happiness in the echo of love. Sharing the pain of others can also relieve your own pain; showing your own warmth will also receive the warm gift of others. This is the magical power of love.\n\nYes, troubles, more often, are the result of selfishness. When a person has others in his heart and loves others, troubles will be lessened.\n\nThe words of a philanthropist make young people feel like they can see the sun through the clouds.\n\nOnce again, the unit organized a trip, and the young man saw an old woman pounding rice in a farm household. While pounding rice, she hummed a folk song. Looks very happy.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/StyiONxVh7g7jmObGno-W.png?height=270&width=390)\n\nHe also shared his confusion to the old woman, hoping to get a different answer from her.\n\ntrouble? The old woman frowned and looked at the young man and said, \"I have been working from morning to night. I have been busy all my life. As long as I am working, I am singing and I am happy. I don't have time to worry.\n\nThe old woman paused and said to herself, maybe, only people who are free will be troubled.\n\nThinking of the words of wise men and philanthropists in the past, at that moment, young people suddenly became enlightened: It turned out that this world, unable to let go, no love in the heart, and boredom, will all be the source of troubles, and no matter what it is, it will become a spiritual source. The quagmire makes a person miserable.\n\nWhen the young man understands this, it is natural that he also finds a happy direction in life.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ejh5Am_Vk7xkCf5EakrzE.png?height=274&width=441)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658282704, "digest": "uaJF57WgpX1RvEESePVFSqQ_uC9KZ4Rhlq5Tb0RjAoA", "contributor": "0x14bd6177124529E8409993fBf08DDB0702695730"}

{"id": "MZaN6pIGtbrqN336Na6QGRDuDz4Eyz7rxYJmx2OQFxo", "title": "#Winning", "body": "This week I had planned to write on the topic of doxing, or more specifically, about the question of “to dox or not to dox”, and the choice for, or against, web3 anonymity. As inspired as I initially felt to explore it, once I sat down to outline it the work began to feel like a grind. Then, as I often do these days when feeling stuck, I turned my attention to twitter for a daily download of crypto news and DAOist musings. Somewhere in my feed, from someone I had never heard of, there appeared the following,\n\n“You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.\nThat’s why every quarter, I evaluate myself and my friends on 3 key criteria:\n\n* Income\n* Fitness\n* Influence\n\nAnyone who scores below me is cut off.\nComplacency is the first step towards mediocrity.”\n\nA day later, though I don’t recall all the details of my reaction, I think it a safe bet it included some combination of a furrowed brow, my best [gas face](https://slangdefine.org/g/gas-face-13ec.html) and nausea.  All of that before I fired back with the first thing to come to mind as a counter blow.\n\n“Congratulations on a life devoid of either giving or receiving unconditional love. You’re winning though. 👊”\n\n[https://twitter.com/HAshBrown_27/status/1548437771974348801?s=20&t=4QqD9qeeewCOpN7zYUJ16g](https://twitter.com/HAshBrown_27/status/1548437771974348801?s=20&t=4QqD9qeeewCOpN7zYUJ16g)\n\nSoon after that I turned off my computer and went out for the day. Honestly, I don’t think it occurred to me that I would even look at the tweet again. To the contrary, as someone new to twitter this year, I expected my response would go largely ignored, joining my 20-or-so other tweets in the land of twitter oblivion. To my surprise though, when I returned home several hours later, I noticed my twitter notification bell ringing, alerting me to the fact that my response had close to 200 likes. 20 hours later that number is now up to 488. Not that I’m counting.\n\nI’m new to this twitter thing, and as far as “likes” are concerned, have only facebook likes of posts of my kids, mountain views and fishing pictures to compare it to. 488 likes seems like a lot though. So while it may be small potatoes to seasoned tweeters with big followings, I’m a babe in the woods here, feeling pretty proud of that 488 thank you very much. Ooh, lookie there, just shot past 500. Am I going viral? LFG!!!\n\nSeriously though, upon looking into the phenomena of my most-liked social media entry ever, I see the person I responded to has a lot of followers. 6,075 to be exact. And digging a little deeper I realize he likely intended his tweet as satire. Gas face rescinded. Perhaps the joke is on me for responding to it.\n\nSatire or not, and irrespective of whether his friendship circles have anything to do with crypto and Web3, [@_mihir](https://twitter.com/__mihir?s=20&t=iOpvhasWZtEkPYiiXfkDYw) points to something very concerning to me about Web3 culture and the playing field of web3 identity. Playas gonna play. So how will Web3 define winning?\n\nBefore we get into all that I sense some context would be helpful.  A man in my early 50’s, I am at most a social media dabbler. I have a facebook page that I post on occasionally and to keep up with the lives of my 926 friends. I have created a few blogs over the years that I have enjoyed writing on but never broadcasted. Instagram? Ohhh hellll no….except to check in on the lives of my college-age children. I regard the notion of creating a web “identity” as near hostile to my bias for real-life interaction with others and time outdoors. And other than a short list of physical ailments, I can’t think of anything I’d like less than “followers”.\n\nSo what am I doing here worrying and writing about Web3 culture?  Fair question. What can I say except [orange pills](https://ryanslot.substack.com/p/what-it-means-to-be-orange-pilled#details) are a thing. [Green pills](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylewestaway/2022/06/16/how-crypto-can-regenerate-the-world/?sh=7ed83b602fd3) too. I’ve fallen down a [crypto rabbit hole](https://garywoodfine.com/going-down-the-crypto-rabbit-hole/) and I can’t get up!\n\nThe truth is that while I wrestle with mixed emotions about getting involved, I am thankful for crypto’s role in opening my mind (🤯) and luring me beyond my comfort zone.  For every horror story of greed, theft and exploitation related to this new frontier, I find most of what I read about the space to be inspiring.  To quote the immortal words of Buffalo Springfield, [“Somethings Happening Here”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQUj56sqicU), 2020’s style, and most days I want to be a part of it.\n\nOne example of this is an article, [“The Future of Work”](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-future-of-work), by David Hoffman. David makes a strong case for why Digital Organizations (DO’s), enabled by the blockchain and tokenized incentives, will present unprecedented opportunities for humans to coordinate both our hearts’ and minds’ shared interests to do purposeful work together.  Among the many lines to strike a chord with me David writes,\n\n“If you are a young person, looking for purpose, meaning, and eventually a salary, establishing yourself as a strong DOer is one of the best footholds you can establish for yourself….If you believe DOs are the future, you should start DOing now, so that you become the scarce resource for both DOs and people who need help DOing.”\n\nRelative to the audience David likely had in mind I am not a “young person”. That said, aside from a rather curmudgeonly attitude toward social media, I pride myself at being young in spirit. I am DOing (and DAOing) now and, in time, aspire to be among the scarce, most valued resources of the space. So what game am I playing? And what was it about @_mihir”s tweet that bothered me so?\n\nThough it has been over 20 years since I worked as an equity analyst at an investment brokerage firm, that work, and my short time in the industry, taught me some valuable lessons. The most memorable of them is the difference between the “game” of judging companies’ worth on the basis of quarterly performance vs. that of valuing them (or not) on the basis of fundamental strengths relative to longer-term investment horizons. The former game is played to generate transactions that pay brokers and their firms. The latter is played to maximize investors’ returns.\n\nWeb3 playing fields, DOs and DAOs included, will create whole new worlds from which to relate to the earth, token projects, and one another. There will be more games to go around than anyone can count in the space’s many arenas. Short-term trading, of crypto and people, can be fun, even profitable.

{"id": "naOam-pVShVNASvNBipFIBALEFGXfRWzEtZ_rCA94lg", "title": "秒杀黑洞的类星体，光芒贯穿半个宇宙，会撕裂银河系？", "body": "在我们的认知当中，黑洞应该可以被称得上是整个宇宙中最为危险的天体之一。**由于黑洞本身的质量极大，因此它可以产生几乎一种无法逆转的吸引力。**大型的黑洞甚至可以在一段时间内把一整个星系吞噬殆尽，甚至连光线也无法逃离黑洞的捕捉。\n\n但是在科学家们的研究过程中，人们逐渐发现了一种新的天体，这种天体相较于黑洞更为恐怖和神秘，它的名字就叫做**类星体**……\n\n### 宇宙中的类星体\n\n从类星体这个名字当中，**我们就可以看出这是一种与星体结构类似，但却并非是真正意义上“星”的天体。**\n\n简单来说，类星体的结构与我们认知当中的恒星极为类似，**但它们却在某些方面与恒星有着显著的区别**，它们并不像恒星一样可以将自身的物质和进行压缩成一个球形，**只是以一种近乎于缥缈的状态存在于宇宙当中。**\n\n而**类星体与恒星最为相似的地方，就是二者都能向外发射一种电波。**\n\n我们也可以**把这种电波称之为射电源，恒星与类星体发射的射电源，在宇宙当中可谓是极其常见**，我们每天都能通过射电望远镜观测到这种电波的存在。**而那些我们无法弄清来源的射电波，其实就是来自于类星体。**\n\n从这些描述当中，**我们能够看得出类星体是一种在宇宙当中极为特殊的存在**，但它的天体属性从单纯的描述来说无论怎样也称不上是恐怖，为什么天文学家们会对其感到畏惧呢？\n\n### 类星体的三大恐怖之处\n\n类星体的**第一大恐怖之处就是它的亮度**，2**015年，我国的天文工作者们发现了一个巨型的类星体**，这个类星体距离我们的地球足足有**128亿光年**的距离。\n\n按理来说，在这样遥远的距离之下，任何物质都是难以被观测到的。而天文学家们之所以能够轻而易举的发现类星体，就是因为它的亮度实在是太过惊人，**根据数据分析，该类星体的亮度可以达到太阳的420万亿倍。**\n\n**正因如此，我们才能够跨越100多亿光年的距离来对其进行观测。**\n\n科学家们还发现：**类星体在宇宙当中的红移值都很高**，也就是说，**它们与地球之间的距离其实是在不断被拉长的**。如果我们的地球距离一个类星体过近的话，很有可能会对地球上的人类产生重大的影响。\n\n类星体的**第二大恐怖之处就是其内部所蕴含的能量**，类星体的体型放在宇宙当中其实并不算大，一般都不会超过普通的星系，但是，**一个类星体内部所蕴藏的能量却要比普通的星系高上几千亿倍。**\n\n从很大程度上来说，**类星体之所以能够有如此大的能量效应，是因其超高的亮度。**\n\n如果我们把一块光伏电池板放置在距离类星体只有1亿公里的地方，**我们只需要从中接受一秒钟的光能，所接收到的能量总数就可以在理论上帮助人类的0.72级文明突破到二级文明。**\n\n但这样的想法终究无法实现，因为**类星体周边的能量物质运动太不稳定，如果真的把探测器送到离它这么近的位置，无疑是自寻死路。**\n\n类星体的**第三大恐怖之处是其违背物理学常识的运动速度。**“物质的运动速度无法超过光速”是物理学界一个不争的事实，但是**科学家们在观测类星体上的物质运动史，却发现其分离速度达到了288万公里/秒。**\n\n直到今天也没有人能够说清类星体内部如此剧烈的物质运动和超高的速度转换究竟是什么原因。\n\n### “秒杀”黑洞的天体\n\n在天文学界**，类星体可以被称之为是能够秒杀黑洞的天体**。与黑洞一样，**类星体也有着对于周围物质的吞噬能力**，而且在类星体中心一般都有着一个巨星的黑洞存在，也就是说：**这两者之间是一种包含与被包含的关系。**\n\n**在黑洞的帮助之下，类星体会吞噬周边的物质，并且在吞噬的过程中不断旋转物质产生摩擦**，类星体的发光原理基本上就可以被归类于物质摩擦时所产生的光能和热能。在这个过程中，**类星体甚至还能向外传送大量的热能辐射以及射线光波。**\n\n所以不论从哪个角度来说，**类星体在宇宙当中的毁坏力都是要高于黑洞的，因为黑洞自身的运动速率并不算快，而类星体却可以以一种超快的速度在宇宙当中横行霸道，**吞噬周边的一切物质。\n\n### 人类是否会受到影响？\n\n那么我们人类是否会受到类星体这种天体的影响呢？这个问题的答案是暂时否定的，因为宇宙中的类星体距离我们都十分遥远，**哪怕放任不管，它们也要足足花上几十亿甚至几百亿年的时间才能够来到可能对地球产生威胁的位置。**\n\n我们的**太阳系正处在一个难得的稳定期，人类可以在这个时间段大力谋求自身的发展。**目前的科学界普遍认为，类星体是整个宇宙当中毁坏力最为惊人的天体，它的出现以及高速运动在某种意义上限制了宇宙生命的发展。\n\n**如果整个宇宙空间内没有类星体这种物质的存在，取而代之的就会是大量的恒星以及星系结构，生命也就能更容易的产生了。**", "timestamp": 1658282573, "digest": "MTrsBfBTiTmCgck00JCqzYiH6jL5o9mynplJEf192wk", "contributor": "0xb3a1316BcD2bE65F2Ba67740946E8F01c0E1311E"}

That is, registering ENS domains containing names of prominent entities beforehand and then later demanding a high price for the domain should the said entity wishes to enter the Web 3.0 space later on.\n\nSince its inception in 2017, there have been over 1.67 million .eth domain registrations across approximately 482,000 owners. More than 154,100 registrations were made recentl between July 5 to July 18, partly due to [lower gas fees](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-name-service-registrations-surge-by-200-amid-lower-gas-fees) and continued interest from entities seeking to enter the Web 3.0 space. To date, the ENS collection on OpenSea has witnessed approximately 46,200 ETH ($71.5 million) in cumulative transaction volume. ", "timestamp": 1658282391, "digest": "-pAwMwTaWlCAVe9zq2xys5OMz8E3TGWvnAYJkzgtsSo", "contributor": "0x9B3492b79E45b21156eE02Daec63af6d1B7368b4"}

Even so, I still enjoy writing.\n\nI especially enjoy writing when I'm feeling down. Because at that time, my sense of touch was the most sensitive, my thinking was also very active, and my thinking ability would also be enhanced. Even the editing and expression of words were far better than usual. I was able to get into the state of writing very well, I might even say it was a good state.\n\nAt that time, I could travel from this real life to another virtual world. There, I was like a god, a god who could overturn clouds and rain, and be omnipotent. I control the fate of all people, whether happy or sad, fortunate or unfortunate. I immersed myself in it and enjoyed it happily.\n\nIn this real life, I always like to observe every person around me in detail and everything that happens to them. When I am alone, I slowly crumble them, reshape them, and sneak them into my novels.\n\nWhenever I see them dazed, confused, hesitant, helpless, tangled... irritable, my thoughts will become clearer and more organized.\n\nI thought to myself, how would I be if he (she) was. After empathy, I will deal with it rationally in my novel, and then arrange various plots, scenes and later changes.\n\nAt that moment, I forgot my true self. Even in real life, I have the same troubles as the storyteller, but at that time, I put them all aside. At that time, all my attention and energy were placed on the people and events in the story.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hssrKiQ-nCpfDIzo61E6D.png?height=280&width=448)\n\nA friend once talked to me about it, and he said, \"This state is called obsession.\"\n\nIn fact, I don't know myself, is this state of obsession or an escape?\n\nPerhaps, in this real life, I am a person who is melancholy and carries a lot of troubles. Entry to me is probably a way of getting out and getting away. Only in this way can I ignore the present moment and gain a temporary relief.\n\nA friend said: \"If this state is escapism, it is too narrow; if it is selflessness, it is very admirable; if it is obsession, then it is even more worthy of appreciation and praise.\"\n\nListening to his words, I laughed and teased him: \"It is very likely that I am still transforming in these states. These should be the process of my evolution...\"\n\nAfter chatting with him, I suddenly came to a realization.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cLfJbFMeOI2OUSb2dNlsM.png?height=266&width=465)\n\nPerhaps, many times, we can see ourselves as other people, both inside and outside the story. In the face of all the complicated and tricky things, we might as well step aside and be a quiet bystander emotionally and seriously, just like watching a movie or TV show. Finally, we combine objective vision, use rational thinking and the most effective way to solve problems.\n\nThen I think that when we have such thoughts, mentality and ability, we should be able to calmly face all the difficulties and various tests in life at any time.\n\nTherefore, the four words \"clouds and winds are light\", it no longer belongs to some people, we can also have it.", "timestamp": 1658284086, "digest": "a4W3Cjz08dgmUZqV7lN8uW7K8_9K1x4BGB7kCI78s1A", "contributor": "0xfE5d245154a4B93d296B3A8F9128e4fcC35DEb80"}

Listening to the rustling sound, I woke up a lot...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Za4UdjGyz0CCdPTP0Wdne.png?height=270&width=390)\n\nWhen it was almost dusk in the afternoon, the sun was about to set on the top of the mountain, and the afterglow of the sun shone on the bamboo forest outside the window. The sun is no longer so strong and harsh, but only a soft light is left. When I raised my head, I could look directly at the sun on the top of the mountain, instead of being unable to open my eyes in the sun like noon. By this time, the wind outside the window had not stopped since the early morning, but was more rapid, as if to catch up with the pace of the sun, so rapid that it could not stop for a moment. I could only hear the wind blowing the bamboo leaves and making a whistling sound. Not only the bamboo leaves were swaying, but the whole bamboo forest was shaking constantly. The whistling wind was accompanied by the rustling of bamboo leaves. The wind outside the window was so strong and powerful that it was desperately playing a majestic symphony. At this time, the wind outside the window was no longer so quiet, and the curtains were also jumping randomly, so I quickly got up and closed the window...\n\nWhen night fell, it was pitch black outside the window, and the dark night was only accompanied by stars. At this time, the wind outside the window has quieted down, it did not go, but just stayed quietly in the bamboo forest outside the window. But I clearly felt its presence, and it quietly entered the window. Touching my face under the light, I felt a chill, and I immediately recovered from being in a daze. And the bamboo forest under the light outside the window did not continue to play music, they were whispering in rustling, and slowly became quiet...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JGfN2VTnnVyZwy3aMImL1.png?height=266&width=456)\n\nIn the dead of night, I also slowly fell asleep under the caress of the wind outside the window. In my dream, there is a bamboo forest outside the window and the wind outside the window. I sit in front of the window, open the window, and quietly look at the bamboo forest outside the window. In fact, the bamboo forest outside the window is not alone, because Fenger has been accompanying them...", "timestamp": 1658284391, "digest": "4qxKRLloFbu3t3rvB0U4nlydI0CItyqMefehwz5x9KI", "contributor": "0xfE5d245154a4B93d296B3A8F9128e4fcC35DEb80"}

Founded by [Arisa Toyosaki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toyosaki/)(google/bitcoin.com), [Winston Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/winstonzhang/) (YC), [Victor Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhangvictorz/) (YC/Tesla) and [Felicia Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/feliciachen0/)(Anduril/Apple), a rockstar team. Their goal is to create high-yielding products with protection in mind for every person's financial security.\n\nTheir inaugural exotic options product is the Fixed Coupon Note. Fixed coupon notes (FCN) are a type of exotic option structured product that has both equity option and bond-like characteristics. You can learn more about their product [here](https://cega.gitbook.io/cega/products/overview/fcn/what-are-fixed-coupon-notes-fcn) \n\nTheir [product](http://cega.fi) has 3 yield offerings.\n\n![Cega's different yield pools](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Pk9fj7ENacKcl995cFWqt.png?height=1048&width=2626)\n\nThey just launched a couple days ago and already have $30M+ in TVL. The team is very clear about the risks and have different levels of APY depending on what you are comfortable with. \n\n# Allocating OrangeDAO’s treasury\n\nWe created a strategy/defi team that increases the yield the treasury of the DAO in a stable and secure way and also supports the protocols we invest in. \n\nAs a macro strategy for our treasury, we have a combination of different levels of risk going from Aave protocol to exotic options. \n\nOne of the frameworks we use to analyze these opportunities is the following:\n\n* Who is the team behind this?\n* Is this audited?\n* Do we understand the business risks behind the protocol?\n* TotalValueLocked\n\nCega was clearly a superb choice and decided to allocate part of our treasury in a combination of their different baskets.\n\nWe are looking for more yield opportunities, if you are building something please let us know at orlando@orangedao.xyz , alex@orangedao.xyz .\n\nWe want to be your first check and then one of your early adopters. 🍊\n\n*DISCLAIMER: None of this is financial advice.

AMMs are an important primitive in DeFi, as anyone can deposit their own tokens in an AMM LP, receiving a share of trading fees and the LP tokens in return.\n\nHow do AAMs differ from traditional finance? In the traditional trading model, buyers and sellers use something called an *order book*, where they write down what they want to trade in a huge list with everyone’s trades. The behavior of the buyers and sellers controls the market rates in the order book.\n\nAMMs do not rely on humans to manage trades, which are controlled directly by algorithms. An AMM replaces the buy and sell orders in an order book market with a liquidity pool of two assets, both valued relative to each other. As one asset is traded for the other, the relative prices of the two assets shift, and the new market rate for both is re-calculated. \n\nThe majority of AMMs use the *constant mean market maker equation *(also known as the constant product equation) to define how liquidity pools behave:\n\n```\nBalance of token A * Balance of token B = Constant product\n```\n\nFor example, in a pool with 2,000,000 tokens A and 1,000 tokens B, the constant product is 2,000,000,000. This inverse correlation then determines the trading price of the assets at any moment, as the price of one token increases when the price of the second token decreases:\n\n```\nMarket price for token A = Balance of token / Balance of  token A\n```\n\nThe price curve is often utilized as a way to visualize this relation:\n\nTo find the swap price for the assets in a given pool (i.e., the amount of **token A** received when you exchange a certain quantity of **token B**), we calculate the balances for each token that are needed in the pool to keep the constant product unchanged after the swap:\n\n```\nBalance of token A - Quantity of token A received = (Constant product) / (Balance of token B + Quantity of token B paid)\n```\n\nThe amount of **token A** received from this swap conveys the “buy price”, and it’s calculated from the relation above:\n\n```\nQuantity of token A received = (Balance of token A * Quantity of token B  paid) / (Balance of token B  +  Quantity of token B paid)\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## Enter Balancer\n\nLaunched in 2018, Balancer introduced a protocol for configurable liquidity on the Ethereum blockchain and other EVM-compatible systems. With Balancer, users are able to create liquidity pools with up to eight different ERC-20 tokens, in any ratio. These pools can be thought of as automatically *rebalancing portfolios*, providing traders with what can be called a *decentralized index fund.* \n\nBalancer routes several pools together, allowing easy trades from one token in one pool to any other token in another pool. These multi-asset pools work using what is called *weighted math*, designed to allow swaps between any asset whether or not they have a price correlation. Balancer's price equation is a generalization of the constant product equation, accounting for multi-tokens and weightings that are not evenly split, so that prices are determined by the pools’ balances and weights.\n\nBalancer’s core smart contract is called [“The Vault''](https://docs.balancer.fi/products/the-vault), and it controls and holds all tokens in each of the Balancer pools. The Vault’s architecture separates the *token accounting and management* from the *pool logic*, simplifying the pools’ contracts. In this architecture, [Balancer’s Protocol Swap Fees](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/fees) are the percentage of swap fees collected by pools defined on a contract named [ProtocolFeesCollector.sol](https://etherscan.io/address/0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F#readContract). These fees include flash loan fees, and they are adjusted through governance by the Balancer’s DAO. \n\n\n---\n\n## Balancer’s Flash Loan\n\nFlash Loans are special smart contract operations that allow the borrowing of any available amount of assets (up to the total liquidity) without collateral. This is possible as long as the liquidity plus interests are returned within one block transaction. If the borrower is unable to repay the loan, the entire transaction is simply reverted. \n\nA common use of flash loans is on arbitrage algorithms, searching for profit by trading an asset on a first DEX and then getting back the asset plus gains on other DEXs. \n\nIn the context of Balancer, a trader could borrow any amount of tokens available on The Vault to use on a flash loan. The logic for these types of transactions is specified in the [FlashLoans.sol](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8#code#F5#L20) contract, more specifically in the flashLoan function:\n\n1\\. This function starts with straightforward initializations, ensuring that the length of the token array and the amount array match, and assigning the zero address to the previousToken variable (to ensure the tokens are sorted and unique):\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UREh_nf-SFXdGe8LCFFVz.png?height=472&width=1136)\n\n2\\. The first loop over the tokens’ array is used to record the pre-balance of each token, calculate the loan fees, and transfer each amount of token to the receiver.

{"id": "sFI6EFDmfn0pdkjimICnaCJXplZwP1ZePFfHoa5pIKo", "title": "解析 StarkNet 发币的影响：L2 竞争格局将会有何改变？", "body": "> StarkNet 开启 L2 生态军备竞赛，甚至将挑战以太坊统治地位。\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* StarkNet 发币或将加速 Arbitrum 发币进程。参考 Optimism 发币加速生态发展期间相关数据超过 Arbitrum 的历史经验，StarkNet 可能也同样会在一段时期内赢得对 Arbitrum 的竞争，加剧 Arbitrum 的竞争压力。\n* 短期来看，Optimism 兼容 EVM 背靠以太坊生态，支持相关开发工具，开发门槛低，项目移植难度低，相比 StarkNet 具有开发优势；Optimism 与 StartNet 市场份额差距较大，StarkNet 短期难以追赶。长期来看，StarkNet 的去中心化 PoS 机制将在与 Optimism 的中心化 MEVA 机制的竞争中胜出。\n* OPR 类项目具有内在的 MEVA 困境，StarkNet 的 PoS 机制能够限制 MEV，并且能够创造更高的收入天花板，具有代币经济壁垒，长期将在与 OPR 之争中胜出。\n* StarkNet 将通过捕获 gas 结算价值和截取网络流量的方式挑战以太坊统治地位。\n\n7 月，L2 生态发生的关键事件无疑是 L2 四大天王之一的 StarkNet 官宣代币提案。\n\n虽然，目前公布的代币提案中明确强调会向生态开发者空投大量代币，但没有明确提到「用户空投」相关字眼，让众多提前埋伏生态的撸毛党大失所望。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/l0wzggr4byxnbhik.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://medium.com/starkware/part-1-starknet-sovereignty-a-decentralization-proposal-bca3e98a01ef)*\n\n但作为估值高达 80 亿、还有 V 神、Naval、Multicoin、Coinbase 、Paradium、Tiger Global 等豪华资方站队的 L2 明星项目，StarkNet 对加密行业的影响将是全方位的。\n\n一方面，StarkNet 理论上可以在继承以太坊的安全性前提下将以太坊 TPS 从 15 提高到 10000+，将 gas 从小数点前一位数优化到后两位数，StarkNet 对加密网络的影响正如互联网从 3G 到 4G 的网络提速为之后的移动互联网生态爆发奠定基础一样，网络扩容将会极大推动整个网络生态的发展。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/yryo37azeaervwsy.png!heading)\n\n*来源：Xiang｜W3.Hitchhiker，以上计算前提是以当前 ETH  价格为 2500 U，区块 gaslimit 为 30,000,000，gas 费用为 30 Gwei，平均 13 秒的出块时间计算， 极限 TPS 指对应运行环境占领了所有以太坊区块空间 (在证明验证上花费 500,000 gas)，普通 TPS 指对应运行环境占领了所有以太坊 1/3 的区块空间。*\n\n另一方面，StarkNet 作为 L2 众多扩容项目中的一员，面临与 Arbitrum、Optimism、zkSync 等其他 L2 热门项目的竞争，L2 格局将会出现垄断还是共存尚未可知。\n\n本文将聚焦在 StarkNet 发币对 L2 赛道热门项目如 Arbitrum、Optimism 的影响以及对以太坊的挑战。对于 StarkNet 官宣发币计划，其他 L2 项目可能做出哪些应对措施？还没发币的 Arbitrum 会被迫提前发币参与竞争吗？StarkNet 如何解决以太坊以及 Optimistic Rollup 上的 MEV 问题？L2 的竞争格局将会有何改变？以太坊的地位会被削弱吗？\n\nStarkNet 是一个无需许可的去中心化 L2 ，旨在允许以太坊通过称为 STARKs 的加密协议进行扩展，同时不损害以太坊的去中心化、透明度、包容性和安全性的核心原则。它可以在不损失以太坊的可组合性和安全性的前提下提高 TPS 与降低 gas。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023945/2lo2gnrasturykqc.jpg!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://foresightnews.pro/article/detail/barnabe.substack.com)*\n\nL2 是描述一类特定的以太坊扩展解决方案的统称，是扩展以太坊并继承以太坊安全保证的独立区块链。根据底层技术的差异，L2 Rollup（汇总）方案主要可分为欺诈证明的 Optimistic Rollup（乐观汇总，下文简称 OPR）和有效性证明的 Zero Knowledge Rollup（零知识汇总，下文简称 ZKR）两类。StarkNet 是 Zero Knowledge Rollup 方案中的一种。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/zwwcpjbvtmekdxic.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GmHoX2iBBa-_TDC8_dH88g)*\n\nOptimistic Rollup 最热门的项目包括 Optimism、Arbitrum，Zero Knowledge Rollup 最热门的项目包括 StarkNet、zkSync。Optimism、Arbitrum、StarkNet、zkSync 也被称为 L2 四大天王。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19035210/yvfl999zdkn1a0by.png!heading)\n\n*TVL 数据[来源](https://l2beat.com/)（与后文 Arbitrum 部分数据源不一致）；用户数据[来源](https://dune.com/gm365/L2)；Optimism 估值来源：Messari，其他信息来自 Google*\n\n## 二、对 Arbitrum 的影响\n\nOPR 的 Optimism 在 5 月 31 日公布代币计划，6 月 1 日执行代币空投，ZKR 的 StarkNet 在 7 月 13 日公布代币计划，随着 L2 赛道中的两大竞争对手都推出代币计划，Arbitrum 可能会加速其代币进程。\n\n首先回顾 Optimism 发币事件对 Arbitrum 的影响。\n\nArbitrum 与同属 OPR 路线的 Optimism 存在一定差距。截至 7 月 18 日，Arbitrum 的 TVL 达到 10.4 亿美元，占 L2 总市场份额达到 69.84%，Opimism 的 TVL 达到 3.89 亿美元，市场份额达到 26.06%，Arbitrum 暂时领先 Optimism。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19031550/kpnzdkg5raslnpkk.png!heading)\n\n*数据[来源](https://defillama.com/chains/Rollup)*\n\n但 Optimism 在 5.31 公布代币计划，6.1 执行空投之前的 TVL 占比仅有 14.37%。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19031610/ic08joceb78kyzzi.png!heading)\n\n*数据[来源](https://defillama.com/chains/Rollup)*\n\n自发币至 7 月 19 日，Optimism 在 L2 中的 TVL 份额从 14.37% 上升至 26.06%，同期 Arbitrum 的 TVL 份额从 80.80% 下降至 69.84%。\n\n以下图表进一步展示了在 Optimism 在发行代币并执行空投的 50 天内（截至 7 月 19 日）Optimism 与 Arbitrum 生态发展的对比情况。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19041243/mu0b6t1nfrvemt0m.png!heading)\n\n*[来源](https://dune.com/maxlion/l2-overview)*\n\n该图表通过对比 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 的用户与 TVB 数据，显示了 Optimism 空投代币事件 50 天内用户和资金的增长。\n\n左上角图表显示最近 50 天 Arbitrum 的用户数量，近 50 天 Arbitrum 的用户达到 67,776；左下角图标显示最近 50 天 Optimism 的用户数量，近 50 天 Optimism 的用户数量达到 75,497。Optimism 同期用户数量超过 Arbitrum 11.4%。\n\n右上角图标显示最近 50 天 Arbitrum 的 TVB，近 50 天桥接到 Arbitrum 的资产达到 55,929 个 ETH；右下角图表显示最近 50 天 Optimism 的 TVB，近 50 天桥接到 Optimism 的资产达到 62,209 个 ETH。Optimism 同期 TVB 领先 Arbitrum 11.2%。\n\n我们可以发现，Optimism 在推出 OP 代币并空投之后的 50 天内，Optimism 的用户数量与 TVB 均超过 Arbitrum，可以得知 Optimism 的生态发展与推出代币计划存在正相关性。Optimism 发行代币并执行空投的举措推动了生态发展并在一段时间内领先了与对手 Arbitrum 的竞争。\n\n根据 Optimism 发币对 Arbitrum 的成功竞争经验，我们可以试着做出以下推理：\n\n* 前提 1：发行代币并执行空投的举措可以推动生态发展并在一段时间内赢得竞争。\n* 前提 2：StarkNet 是 Arbitrum 的竞争对手。\n* 前提 3：StarkNet 即将发行代币并执行空投。\n\n结论：StarkNet 将在一段时间内赢得与 Arbitrum 的竞争。\n\n我们也许可以预见随着 StarkNet 发行代币并执行空投计划，StarkNet 的用户、开发者、TVL/TVB、应用数量将会迎来一段时期的增长，从而抢夺 L2 市场份额，增加 Arbitrum 的竞争压力从而加速其发币进程。\n\n## 三、对 Optimism 的影响\n\nStarkNet 的发币与空投对 Optimism 生态影响有限。Optimism 背靠 EVM 生态以及既有的 DeFi 市场份额，StarkNet 短期难以撼动 Optimism 地位。\n\nOptimism 兼容 EVM，支持 EVM 工具，对大量的以太坊开发者而言进入 Optimism 开发应用难度较低，主网应用移植难度也低。而 StarkNet 原生的 zkVM 不兼容 EVM，StarkNet 的 Cairo 语言及其相关开发工具也阻碍以太坊开发者进入 StarkNet 生态。\n\n与此同时，Optimism 相比 StarkNet 占据更大的 DeFi 市场，TVB 达到 178,719 ETH，StarkNet 的 TVB 仅有 545 ETH。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023945/hd7h17n7zjyrhm0t.png!heading)\n\n*数据[来源](https://dune.com/gm365/L2)*\n\n但长期来看由于 OPR 固有的代币经济困境，Optimism 将持续依赖 MEVA（最大可提取价值拍卖）作为收入来源。而 StarkNet 的代币提案明确指出不将 MEVA 作为网络收入，并将推动排序器去中心化运营，逐步建立 PoS 机制，Optimism 的 MEVA 收入将落后于 StarkNet 的 PoS 收入，打破长期存在于 OPR 类项目中的 MEVA 困境。\n\n下文将深入分析 OPR 中面临的 MEVA 困境与 StarkNet 的 PoS 创新。\n\n## 四、OPR 的 MEVA 困境\n\nStarkNet 的 PoS 机制能够打破包括 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 在内的 OPR 项目的 MEVA 困境。\n\n在像以太坊这样的 L1 网络上，区块链矿工（也称为验证者、区块生产者或聚合者）名义上通过区块奖励和交易费用获得收入。但作为一个负责生产特定区块的区块生产者，它可以在该区块的范围内拥有很大的权力，比如可以任意重新排序交易，在其他交易之前插入自己的交易，并将原交易完全延迟到下一个区块。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023945/g7pj9iq0yaqzd65s.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-auction-auctioning-transaction-ordering-rights-as-a-solution-to-miner-extractable-value/6788)*\n\n和 L1 的情况类似，在 L2 上，L2 的排序器类似 L1 上的矿工 / 节点，拥有对交易排序的权力，排序器可以选择优先执行有更高 gas 价格的事务以获得额外利润，该额外利润称为 MEV（Maximal/Miner Extractable Value，最大可提取价值）。对排序权拍卖的行为叫做 MEVA（Maximal/Minter Extractable Value Auction）。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19031849/8i2emk6wpywh5ut7.jpg!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://foresightnews.pro/article/detail/barnabe.substack.com)*\n\n举例：小明发起交易需要支付 n 个单位的 gas，当套利者发现了交易信息，就可以通过向排序器支付 n+x 个 gas 从而优先获得交易权，套利者可以再把该交易以 n+x+y 个单位的价格卖回小明，套利者获得 y 个 gas 的利润，小明多支付了 x+y 的 gas，排序器额外获得了 x+y 的收入。假如小明在该笔交易中获得的最大收入是 m，出于功利目的，只要 m>=n+x+y，小明仍然愿意支付 n+x+y 的 gas，理论上套利者最多将原价为 n 的 gas 推高到 m。\n\n以下是 MEV 近年来的的增长曲线：\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/nylz362dd49vijdm.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://explore.flashbots.net/)*\n\n### MEVA 的危害\n\n如前所述，MEV 的存在理论上一方面可以无限推高用户成本，直到达到用户愿意为该交易支付的最高价格，伤害用户的应用体验，另一方面额外发起的套利交易也会占用链上 TPS 增加网络负担造成网络拥堵。而 Arbitrum 和 Optimism 都通过中心化运营排序器（类比 L1 节点）的方式将 MEVA 并作为收入来源，这还将加剧中心化的运营风险。\n\n### MEVA 的困境\n\n从代币供应角度来看，如果固定 OPR 代币供应，并将链上 gas 以 OPR 代币结算，这将会不断消耗 OPR 代币，不断抬高 gas 价格，L2 失去意义，用户和资金将会逃离。如果循环供应，需要设计代币铸造机制，引入 PoW 或者 PoS 并推动排序器去中心化运营，但这与 OPR 中心化排序器的现实相矛盾。Optimism 和 Arbitrum 都将 MEV 作为主要的收入来源，形成财政依赖之后就需要继续保证排序器中心化以获得 MEV 收益。\n\n简而言之，Arbitrum 和 Optimism 等 OPR 项目的 MEV 困境就是：由于依赖 MEV 收入，只能中心化运营排序器，而中心化运营排序器无法实现去中心的代币供应，无法推动去中心化的 PoS 或 PoW 共识机制，使得用户成本高体验差、网络负担大、具有中心化运营风险。\n\n而 StarkNet 代币提案中提到的在 L2 上建立的 PoS 机制将会破解存在于 OPR 项目中的 MEVA 难题。\n\n## 五、StarkNet 的 PoS 创新\n\n长久以来 PoS 作为 L1 项目的共识机制被人们熟知，StarkNet 是第一个采用 PoS 的 L2 Rollup 项目。采用 PoS 的 StarkNet 作为一个 L2 项目可以打破长期存在于 L2 上的 MEVA 困境，降低用户支付成本，改善平台体验，缓解网络拥堵情况，还将极大提高 L2 收入上限。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/zvu1tteu6ddur91c.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-stake)*\n\n### 限制 MEV\n\nStarkNet 的 PoS 机制可以通过质押与共识规则限制 MEV。\n\n在过去，关于 L2 排序器的运营方式包括两种思路：\n\n* 集中排序器，像 Optimism 和 Arbitrum 这样的中心化排序器运营商通过拍卖获得全部 MEV，但他们可以「自觉地」承诺将收入投入到生态建设中回馈用户与开发者；\n* 分散排序器或者节点，MEV 利润给到投机者和矿工，就像在 Solana 和以太坊这样的 L1。\n\n而这两者都曾因此出现 gas 飙升、网络拥堵的情况。\n\nStarkNet 的方式是推动排序去中心化运营，开发者可以申请成为排序器运营者，拥有 StarkNet 代币的用户可通过质押代币成为质押者，作为奖励，排序器与质押者可能因为按照共识规则执行排序职能获得奖励，这在一定程度上可以限制无序的 MEV，实现相对公平的交易排序，限制恐怖的 gas 飙升与不必要的网络拥堵。\n\n### 更多收入\n\n长期来看，建立 PoS 机制的 StarkNet 将会取得相比 OPR 项目更高的收入天花板。\n\nArbitrum、Optimism 的协议收入通过 MEVA 获得，最大值取网络上的潜在交易利润之和，利润受到网络上的 DeFi 应用影响。Optimistic Rollup 所发行的代币仅有治理权与 MEV 收入的分红权。\n\nStarkNet 在 PoS 机制下的协议收入，可能由 gas 和质押奖励构成（暂未公布细节）。gas 收入取决于 StarkNet 网络的应用需求——与以太坊类似，PoS 的质押机制使得质押者与排序器可以铸造新的代币。\n\n而且 StarkNet 属于 ZKR，理论上的 TPS 和 gas 优化上限比 OPR 高很多。OPR 的性能优化有限，目前来看只能运营 DeFi 等相对低 TPS、高单位收益的场景，而 StarkNet 上更有可能产生应用创新，促进更多应用类别的爆发。加上 StarkNet 上的 gas 由 StarkNet 代币支付，因此可以推理 StarkNet 的收入上限高于 OPR。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/abp9ljlpi3230csc.png!heading)\n\n*来源：Xiang｜W3.Hitchhiker，以上计算前提是以当前 ETH 价格为 2500 U，区块 gaslimit 为 30,000,000，gas 费用为 30 Gwei，平均 13 秒的出块时间计算， 极限 TPS 指对应运行环境占领了所有以太坊区块空间 (在证明验证上花费 500,000 gas)，普通 TPS 指对应运行环境占领了所有以太坊 1/3 的区块空间。*\n\nStarkNet 作为第一个建立 PoS 机制的 L2 项目，打破了长期存在于 L2 Rollup 中的 MEVA 困境。PoS 的共识参与机制能够限制 MEV，降低用户支付成本，提高平台体验，缓解网络拥堵，获得更高的收入上限，其代币经济远比 Optimistc Rollup 类项目良性健康，长期来看将会使得 StarkNet 在 L2 的竞争中获得更大的优势。StarkNet 的代币计划将是 L2 发展史上的重要节点。\n\n## 六、StarkNet 挑战以太坊\n\nStarkNet 的 PoS 创新使得 StarkNet 不仅领先于其他 OPR 项目，还将会挑战以太坊的地位。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/j65t9cf1hxyiazg7.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://ethereum.org/en/)*\n\n### 网络结算\n\nStarkNet 代币与 ETH 将会争夺 gas 的结算价值。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/v2fbb13htjcurxmo.jpg!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://foresightnews.pro/article/detail/barnabe.substack.com)*\n\n尽管 StarkNet 作为以太坊的 L2 需要用 ETH 支付将汇总信息发布在以太坊主网上的打包与发布费。但 StarkNet 网络上的 gas 由 StarkNet 代币支付，这会分流以太坊上的 gas 收入。\n\n一方面，随着 StarkNet 上 TPS 与 gas 不断优化，StarkNet 将会涌现出丰富的生态应用，催生大量的 gas 用量。另一方面，以太坊主网项目不断移植到 StarkNet 以及其他更高 TPS、更低 gas 的 L2 网络上，这会减少以太坊 gas 以及 ETH 代币的使用。此消彼长，StarkNet 代币相比 ETH 获得更多 gas 结算价值。\n\n### 流量截取\n\n开发者和用户可以只与 L2 交互，不与 L1 交互。\n\n![](https://piccdn.0daily.com/202207/19023946/e4qhxxt12gyvwm7h.png!heading)\n\n*图片[来源](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/)*\n\n因为包括 StarkNet 在内的 L2 是 L1 的扩容解决方案，它具有一个单独的执行层并运行在 L1 上，而该执行层继承了 L1 网络的安全保证。用户将不再需要与以太坊主网交互，因为它将仅作为 L2 的数据可用性层。StarkNet 上的 gas 由 StarkNet 代币结算佐证了这一点，当用户使用 StarkNet 上的程序并支付 gas 时没有任何一个环节直接与以太坊主网有关，StarkNet 成了「网络前台」，截取了用户流量（尽管以太坊作为 L1 在背后默默工作）。\n\n## 结语\n\nStarkNet 发币不仅是发币，还是首个创新地应用了 PoS 机制的 L2，在短期内，这不仅将改变 L2 竞争格局，还将在不远的将来接过以太坊的大棒，推动加密网络朝着去中心化、安全、可扩展的方向继续前进。", "timestamp": 1658284778, "digest": "5SayU7tApajgyNwr0WoSZGIQJfl30x8ennBteYzCAZI", "contributor":

引言\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/58003f42a2bde8acd4bd3c007d6951c6.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/the-roadmap-to-serenity-2/)*\n\n转眼 2022 年已走过一半。我们回看 Vitalik 在 2018 年 Devcon 演讲中提出的 Serenity Roadmap，容易发现以太坊的发展路径几经更迭 — 对比当前的路线图，分片被赋予新的含义，eWASM 亦少有人提及。\n\n为了避免潜在的欺诈和用户误导问题，今年 1 月底，以太坊基金会宣布弃用「ETH2」的说法，而是把当前的以太坊主网改称为处理交易和执行的「执行层」，把原 ETH2 的说法改称为协调和处理 PoS 的「共识层」。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/b64f31cd005d0e753d9a3a0132d07527.png)\n\n当前，以太坊官方的路线图涵盖了三部分内容：信标链、合并与分片。\n\n其中，信标链（Beacon Chain）作为以太坊向 PoS 迁移的前置工作，以及共识层的协调网络，于 2020 年 12 月 1 日启用，迄今已运行近 20 个月。\n\n合并（The Merge）指当前以太坊主网与信标链的最终合并，也即执行层与共识层的统一，标志着以太坊正式迁移到 PoS。在 IOSG 的文章「黎明将至：以太坊合并近在咫尺」中，我们介绍了合并相关的重要进展：当前以太坊 Ropsten 与 Sepolia 测试网成功完成了合并，紧接着是 Goerli 的合并；如果一切顺利，意味着我们离主网合并不远了。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/b42cd77884f6103d15eac69e8ca72c85.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://medium.com/decipher-media/blockchain-scaling-solutions-4-1-ethereum-sharding-e88e8cacdfc)*\n\n本文我们将着重讨论分片（Sharding）。原因在于：\n\n* 其一，假定主网合并能够在年内顺利实现，那么分片将紧随其后，作为 2023 年以太坊的开发主轴。\n* 其二，以太坊分片的概念最早由 Vitalik 在 2015 年的 Devcon 1 中提出，此后 GitHub 的 Sharding FAQ 中提出了分片的 6 个发展阶段（如上图）。然而，随着以太坊路线图的更新和相关 EIP 的推动，分片的含义和优先级都产生了很大变化。当我们在讨论分片时，需要先确保对其含义的理解达成一致。\n\n综上两点，梳理清楚分片的来龙去脉是很重要的。本文将着重讨论以太坊原分片、 Danksharding 和 Proto-Danksharding 的由来、进展和未来路线，而非具体到每个技术细节。关于 Danksharding 和 Proto-Danksharding 的详细内容，可参考 IOSG 此前的文章：[「扩容杀手锏 Danksharding

Rollup、数据可用性和分片。\n\n我们在这里快速回看一遍三者的基本概念。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/15f8bede43d93dd444c742368644c47b.png)\n\n当前主流 Rollup 分为 zkRollup 和 Optimistic Rollup。前者基于有效性证明，即批量执行交易，依赖密码学证明 SNARK 来保证状态转换的正确性；后者「乐观地」假设所有状态转换是正确的，除非被证伪；即需要一段时间窗口来确保错误的状态转换能够被发现。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/9cdf01723d7af24a11410c9a75165321.png)\n\n数据可用性对 zkRollup 和 Optimistic Rollup 都非常重要。对前者而言，用户可以基于数据可用性重建二层的所有交易，以确保抗审查；对后者而言，需要使二层的所有数据都被发布，没有被隐藏任一交易。至于当前数据可用性面临的瓶颈与相应的解决方案，在下文中会提到。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/b9b2c3816883d2c8a35df67141271610.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://www.web3.university/article/ethereum-sharding-an-introduction-to-blockchain-sharding)*\n\n以太坊全节点对 EVM 的完整状态进行存储，并参与所有交易验证，这样确保了去中心化和安全性，但随之而来的是可扩展性的问题：交易线性执行，且需要每个节点进行逐一确认，这样无疑是低效的。\n\n此外，随着时间推移，以太坊网络数据不断积累（当前达 786GB），运行全节点的硬件要求随之水涨船高。全节点数量下降将引发潜在的单点故障，并削弱去中心化的程度。\n\n直观地看，分片相当于分工合作，即对所有节点进行分组，每笔交易只需要由单组节点进行验证，并定期向主链提交交易记录，以此实现交易的并行处理（比如有 1000 个节点，原来每笔交易都必须由每个节点进行验证；如果把他们分为 10 组，每组 100 个节点来验证交易，效率显然大大提升了）。采用分片使得在提高可扩展性的同时，也降低了单组节点的硬件要求，从而解决上述两个问题。\n\n## 原分片\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/07e7281156759df22f9a24aa20300c25.jpeg)\n\n*图片[来源](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html)*\n\n以太坊原方案中有 64 个分片，每个分片中都有独立的提议者和委员会，提议者是被随机选择的一个验证者，收集交易并进行排序；委员会是一组验证者的集合（至少由 128 个验证者组成），每隔一定时间被随机分配到各个分片上，并验证交易的有效性，如果委员会的 2/3 投票通过，则调用验证者管理合约（VMC）向信标链提交交易记录。区别于下述的「数据分片」，这种分片也被称为「执行分片」。\n\n## 背景\n\n在聊 Danksharding 之前我们不妨先花点时间了解其背景。个人猜想，Danksharding 推出的社区氛围基础主要来自 Vitalik 的两篇文章。这两篇文章为以太坊的未来发展方向定下了基调。\n\n首先，Vitalik 于 2020 年 10 月发表了「以 Rollup 为中心的以太坊路线图」，提出以太坊需要在中短期内对 Rollup 进行集中支持。其一，以太坊基础层扩容将聚焦于扩大区块的数据容量，而非提高链上计算或 IO 操作的效率。即：以太坊分片旨在为数据 blob（而非交易）提供更多空间，以太坊无需对这些数据进行解释，只确保数据可用。其二，以太坊的基础设施进行调整以支持 Rollup（如 ENS 的 L2 支持、钱包的 L2 集成和跨 L2 资产转移）。长远来看，以太坊的未来应该作为安全性高的、人人可处理的单一执行分片，以及可扩展的数据可用性层。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/9a11857d30b2d0953cf0bcdd2780f6fd.jpeg)\n\n*图片[来源](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html)*\n\n此后，Vitalik 在 2021 年 12 月发表的「Endgame」中描述了以太坊的最终图景：区块产出是中心化的，但区块验证实现去信任且高度去中心化，同时确保抗审查。底层链为区块的数据可用性提供保证，而 Rollup 为区块的有效性提供保证（在 zkRollup 中，通过 SNARK 来实现；在 Optimistic Rollup 中，只需有一个诚实参与者运行欺诈证明节点）。类似于 Cosmos 的多链生态，以太坊的未来将是多 Rollup 共存的——它们都基于以太坊提供的数据可用性和共享安全性。用户依赖桥在不同 Rollup 之间活动，而无需支付主链的高额费用。\n\n上述两篇文章基本确定了以太坊的发展方向：优化以太坊的基础层建设，为 Rollup 服务。以上论点也许基于这样一个看法：既然 Rollup 已经被验证有效并且得到良好的采用，那么「与其将花上几年时间等待一个不确定且复杂的扩容方案（注：指原分片），不如将注意力放在基于 Rollup 的方案上」。\n\n在此之后，Dankrad 提出了新分片方案 Danksharding。以下我们把 Danksharding 的具体技术组成拆分出来理解。\n\n## Proto-Danksharding\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/93f4475b17349506f031ec2cf05a76c1.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://l2fees.info/)*\n\nProto-Danksharding 提出的背景在于，虽然 Rollup 方案对比以太坊主链而言显著降低了交易费用，但还没有到足够低的理想程度。这是由于以太坊主链上提供数据可用性的 CALLDATA 仍然占据较大的花费(16gas / byte)。在原先的设想中，以太坊提出在数据分片中提供每个区块 16MB 的专用数据空间给 Rollup 使用，但距离数据分片的真正实施仍旧遥遥无期。\n\n今年 2 月 25 日，Vitalik 和 DankRad 等提出了 EIP-4844（Shard Blob Transactions）提案，也即 Proto-Danksharding，旨在以简单、前向兼容的方式扩展以太坊的数据可用性，使其在 Danksharding 推出之后仍然可用。该提案的改动仅发生在共识层上，不需要执行层的客户端、用户和 Rollup 开发者进行额外的适配工作。\n\nProto-Danksharding 实际上并未执行分片，而是为将来的分片引入了一种称为「Blob-carrying Transactions」的交易格式。这种交易格式区别于普通交易在于其额外携带了称为 blob 的数据块（约为 125kB），使区块实际上变大，从而提供比 CALLDATA（约为 10kB）更加廉价的数据可用性。\n\n然而，「大区块」的普遍问题是对磁盘空间的要求不断累加，采用 Proto-Danksharding 将使以太坊每年额外增加 2.5TB 的存储量（当前全网络数据仅为 986GB）。因此，Proto-Danksharding 设置了一段时间窗口（例如 30 天），在此之后对 blob 做删除操作，用户或者协议可以在这段时间内对 blob 数据进行备份。\n\n即，以太坊的共识层仅仅作为一个高度安全的「实时公告板」，确保这些数据在足够长的时间里是可用的，并使其他用户或协议有足够的时间来备份数据，而非由以太坊永久保留所有的 blob 历史数据。\n\n这么做的原因是，对存储来说，每年新增的 2.5TB 不在话下，但对以太坊节点却带来不小的负担。至于可能导致的信任假设问题，实际上只需有一个数据存储方是诚实的（1 of N)，系统就可以正常运作，而不需要实时参与验证、执行共识的验证者节点集（N/2 of N）来存储这部分历史数据。\n\n那么，有没有激励来推动第三方对这些数据进行存储呢？笔者暂时没有发现激励方案的推出，但 Vitalik 本人提出了几个可能的数据存储方：\n\n1. 针对应用的协议（例如 Rollup）。它们可以要求节点存储与应用相关的历史数据，如果历史数据丢失，会对这部分应用造成风险，因此它们有动力去做存储；\n2. BitTorrent；\n3. 以太坊的 Portal Network，这是一个提供对协议的轻量级访问的平台；\n4. 区块链浏览器、API 提供者或者其他数据服务商；\n5. 个人爱好者或者从事数据分析的学者；\n6. The Graph 等第三方索引协议。\n\n### Danksharding 数据可用性采样（DAS）\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/fd6eae4e9be18bd96d1d1a1d4bf7b624.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://notes.ethereum.org/@hww/workshop_feb_2022)*\n\n在 Proto-Danksharding 中我们提到新的交易格式使得区块实际上变大了，并且 Rollup 也累积了大量数据，节点需要下载这些数据来保证数据可用性。\n\nDAS 的想法是：如果可以把数据分为 N 个块，每个节点随机地下载其中的 K 个块，就能验证所有数据是否可用，而无需下载所有数据，这样就能大大减少节点的负担。但如果某个数据块丢失了怎么办？仅仅通过随机下载 K 个块很难发现某个块丢失了。\n\n为了实现 DAS，引入了纠删码（Erasure Coding）技术。纠删码是一种编码容错技术，基本原理是把数据分段，加入一定的校验并使各个数据段之间产生关联，即使某些数据段丢失，仍然能通过算法将完整的数据计算出来。\n\n如果把纠删码的冗余比例设置为 50%，那么意味着只需要有 50% 的区块数据可用，网络中的任何人就可以重建所有区块数据，并且进行广播。如果攻击者想要欺骗节点，则必须隐藏掉超过 50% 的区块，但只要进行多次随机采样，这种情况几乎不会发生。（例如，假设对区块进行了 30 次随机采样，这些区块都恰好被攻击者隐藏掉的几率是 2^(-30) ）……\n\n既然节点不下载所有数据，而是依靠纠删码来重建数据，那么首先需要确保纠删码被正确编码，否则用错误编码的纠删码当然没法重建数据。\n\n这样，进一步引入了 KZG 多项式承诺（KZG Polynomial Commitments），多项式承诺是一个「代表」多项式的简化形式，用于证明多项式在特定位置的值与指定的数值一致，而无需包含该多项式的所有数据。Danksharding 中通过采用 KZG 承诺来实现对纠删码的验证。\n\n如果我们可以把所有数据都放在一个 KZG 承诺中当然很省事，但是构建这个 KZG 承诺，或者一旦有部分数据不可用，重建这个数据——两者的资源要求都是巨大的。（实际上，单个区块的数据需要多个 KZG 承诺来保证）而同样为了降低节点负担从而避免中心化，Danksharding 中把 KZG 承诺进行了进一步的拆分，提出了二维 KZG 承诺框架。\n\n当我们依次解决上述问题之后，依靠 DAS，节点或者轻客户端只需要随机下载 K 个数据块，就能够验证所有数据是可用的；这样一来，即便引入「大区块」之后，也不会过多地加重节点的负担。\n\n*（注：特别地，Danksharding 中采用的纠删码算法是 Reed-Solomon 编码；KZG 承诺是由 Kate、Zaverucha 和 Goldberg 发表的多项式承诺方案。在此暂不做展开，对算法原理感兴趣的读者可自行拓展。此外，确保纠删码正确性的方案还有在 Celestia 中采用的欺诈证明）*\n\n### 区块提议者与构建者分离（PBS）\n\n在当前情况下，PoW 矿工和 PoS 验证者既是区块构建者（Builder），又是区块提议者（Proposer）——在 PoS 中，验证者可以用 MEV 的利润获取更多新的验证者席位，从而有更多机会去实现 MEV；此外，大型验证池显然比普通验证人有更强大的 MEV 捕获能力，这样导致了严重的中心化问题。于是，PBS 提出把 Builder 和 Proposer 进行分离。\n\nPBS 的想法如下：Builder 们构建一个排好序的交易列表，并且把出价提交给 Proposer。Proposer 只需要接受出价最高的交易列表，且任何人在拍卖的获胜者被选出之前，无法知道交易列表的具体内容。\n\n这种分离和拍卖的机制引入了博弈和 Builder 之间的「内卷」：毕竟每个 Builder 捕获 MEV 的能力不尽相同，Builder 需要权衡潜在的 MEV 利润、以及拍卖出价之间的关系，这样实际上减少了 MEV 的净收入；而无论最终 Builder 提交的区块是否能够顺利产出，都需要向 Proposer 支付竞价的费用。这样一来，Proposer（广义上是所有验证者集，一定时间内随机重选）相当于分享了一部分 MEV 的收入，削弱了 MEV 的中心化程度。\n\n以上介绍了 PBS 在解决 MEV 方面的优势，而引入 PBS 还有另一个原因。在 Danksharding 中，对 Builder 的要求是：在 1 秒左右计算出 32MB 数据的 KZG 证明，这需要 32-64 核的 CPU；并且在一定时间内以 P2P 的方式广播 64MB 的数据，这需要 2.5Gbit/s 的带宽。显然验证者无法满足这样的要求。\n\n于是 PBS 把两者分开，Proposer 仍然作为一般验证者节点，负责选择交易列表，并广播区块头；而 Builder 作为一个专门的角色，负责上述工作和构建交易列表。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/33e7e78772d19c79cad8cc37648535c0.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://ethresear.ch/t/two-slot-proposer-builder-separation/10980)*\n\n去年 10 月，Vitalik 提出了双 Slot PBS 方案（注：每个 Slot 为 12 秒，是信标链的时间单位），但具体的 PBS 方案仍然在讨论中。\n\n### 抗审查列表（crList）\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/92ae8f830ff42b52075e0f5927ca5762.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://notes.ethereum.org/@hww/workshop_feb_2022)*\n\n但 PBS 也带来一个问题，如果某个 Builder 总是出最高价（甚至宁愿承担经济损失）来赢得拍卖，那么他实际上有了审查交易的能力，可以选择性地不把某些交易包含在区块中。\n\n为此，Danksharding 进一步引入了抗审查列表 crList（即 Censorship Resistance List），即 Proposer 有权利指定一个交易列表，这个交易列表必须被 Builder 所包含；在赢得拍卖后，Builder 需要证明 crList 中的交易都已经被包含在内（或区块已满），否则该区块将被视为无效。\n\n### 小结\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/989bb7d9533650b0402e3e6a590eb567.png)\n\n*图片[来源](https://notes.ethereum.org/@hww/workshop_feb_2022)*\n\n把上述的数据可用性采样（DAS）、区块构建者和提议者分离（PBS）以及抗审查列表（crList）组合起来，就得到了完整的 Danksharding。我们发现，「分片」的概念其实已经被淡化了，尽管保留了 Sharding 的叫法，但实际上的重点已经放在对数据可用性的支持上。\n\n那么 Danksharding 对比原分片有哪些优势呢？\n\n*（Dankrad 本人在这里列举了 Danksharding 的 10 个优点，我们选取两个来具体解释）*\n\n在原分片中，每个单独的分片都有其提议者和委员会，分别对分片内的交易验证进行投票，并由信标链的提议者收集所有投票结果，这项工作很难在单个 Slot 内完成。而在 Danksharding 中只在信标链上存在委员会（广义的验证者集，一定时间内随机重选），由这个委员会来验证信标链区块和分片数据。这相当于把原来的 64 组提议者和委员会简化为 1 组，无论是理论还是工程实现的复杂度都大大降低了。\n\nDanksharding 的另一个优点是，以太坊主链和 zkRollup 之间有可能实现同步调用。上文我们谈到，在原分片中信标链需要收集所有分片的投票结果，这会产生确认的延迟。而在 Danksharding 中，信标链的区块和分片数据由信标链的委员会进行统一认证，也即同个信标区块的交易可以即时访问分片的数据。这样激发了更多可组合性的想象空间：例如 StarkWare 提出的分布式 AMM（dAMM），能够跨 L1/L2 进行 Swap 或共享流动性，从而解决流动性碎片化的问题。\n\n在 Danksharding 得到实施之后，以太坊将变成 Rollup 的统一结算层和数据可用性层。\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/51c50da550820e4adf3a5ec9f60ad582.png)\n\n在上图中，我们对 Danksharding 进行一个总结。\n\n综上，我们大致可以看到，未来的 2 至 3 年内，以太坊路线图的指向性是非常明显的——围绕服务 Rollup 而展开。尽管在此过程中路线图改动与否仍然是未知数：Danksharding 预计将在未来 18-24 个月内实现，而 Proto-Danksharding 将在 6-9 个月内实现。但至少我们明确了 Rollup 作为以太坊的扩容基础，占据着一定的主导地位。\n\n根据 Vitalik 提出的展望，在此我们也提出一些预测性思考和猜想：\n\n* 一是类似 Cosmos 的多链生态，未来以太坊上将出现多 Rollup 的竞争格局，由以太坊为它们提供安全性和数据可用性的保证。\n* 二是跨 L1/Rollup 基础设施将成为刚需。跨域 MEV 将带来更加复杂的套利组合，类似上述提到的 dAMM 带来更丰富的可组合性。\n* 三是多 Rollup 的生态应用将超越以太坊本身。由于以太坊的定位退居其次，作为 Rollup 的数据可用性层，我们猜测更多的应用会迁移到 Rollup 上面去做（若第二点成立）；或者至少在以太坊和 Rollup 上面同时做应用。\n\n> **参考材料：**\n\n> https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/the-roadmap-to-serenity-2/\n\n>

MetaMelange\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/metamelange-7meh4>\n\nMetaMelange 是 NFT 合成协议。协议使用了 inceptionV3 图片分析模型，通过 Tensorflow 进行本地渲染从而将一个主物件和一个背景板融合并生成新的图像。用户可以对生存的图像进行融合程度的调整并一键 mint 成一个新的 NFT。\n\n可自由组合的 NFT 一直被认为是 NFT 未来发展之一。NFT 的可组合性是它主要价值所在，它带来的强大个性化定制能力是 metaverse 所需要的基础组件之一。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/549hVy8Gm5Dq5i46HMz8B.png?height=1141&width=1600)\n\n### 3. ZK KYC SBT\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/zk-kyc-sbt-ozwb2>\n\nZK KYC SBT 是一个链上钱包 KYC 的基建项目。用户 KYC 时会使用 Worldcoin 生成一个具有隐私性（ZK）的身份证明，此身份证明在绑定到用户所拥有的钱包地址后，可成为用于钱包 KYC 认证的灵魂绑定代币。\n\n链上钱包 KYC 验证一度被视为一个难题，零知识证明很好地解决了用户身份核对问题。\n但 Worldcoin 的主要目的不是验证 KYC，而是验证在某个单次使用场景中的单个真人的唯一性。因此，整个 KYC 的信息证明可以使用更符合 KYC 证明需求的零知识证明模块来解决。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/53wxnGYQnENU6D1BYxjIY.png?height=879&width=1600)\n\n### 4. Frens: mobile app to keep your connections\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/frens-mobile-app-to-keep-your-connections-x24r2>\n\nFrens 是一个 IRL (In Real Life，实地) 关系网络。只有当两人线下见面时，他们才能通过 Frens 互相发送一个关系证明代币。整个系统由 Worldcoin 提供真人验证，通过定位来确定两个人之间的距离，通过 WalletConnect 提供用户钱包服务。\n\n相对于网络约会，线下见面是一个更容易建立互相信任的过程。双方面对面交换留下的证明是对个人实际关系网的认证。相比于 Linkedin 的一键 Connect，Frens 依据实地证明形成的朋友圈显然更具说服力。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KzQH_L3FpJynYnDQ46soj.png?height=1600&width=740)\n\n## 5. SubKey\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/subkey-4vxfk>\n\nSubKey 是钱包权限管理的应用。用户使用 SubKey 建立一个特定的钱包权限（如 Transfer）并对此权限进行分享。\n\n举例来说，用户可将在某个 DeFi 平台的清算权限交给一个清算工具/平台，让其代管理进行更合理的清算。或者，用户可把流动性挖矿资金交给专业机构/工具进行平衡，从而减少无偿损失并获得更高的流动性挖矿收益。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V1g1hVtzGPoVn1_7qoYLC.png?height=986&width=1600)\n\n### 6. eth/place\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/eth-place-kwpve>\n\neth/palce 复刻了 Reddit 上最经典的社区艺术项目 r/place （大家自由在一个画板上以像素为单位进行上色）并加入了 NFT 和租借功能。通过 SuperFluid 的 NFT 租借功能，用户可以自由租借一个代表像素上色权的 NFT，并自由设定像素的颜色。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/37fc53mm2GsT7ylsuU3Ti.png?height=985&width=1600)\n\n### 7. Pozitions\n\n**链接**：<https://ethglobal.com/showcase/pozitions-c53qd>\n\nPozitions 是一个基于 Synthetix 期货仓位的流动性服务。通过将 Synthetix 的期货仓位 mint 成 NFT，用户不需要平仓再开仓，可以直接交易仓位。仓位的直接交易能避免交易双方因资金再次借贷而产生额外资金费用，这也能避免税务上与收益相关的一些额外计算。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2SqkZOYT2Rz3sSJ9cmj1f.png?height=1600&width=1085)\n\n### 8. LiquiFlow\n\n**链接**：<https://ethglobal.com/showcase/liquiflow-sunj8>\n\n杠杆和定投（Direct Cost Averaging） 对一些 web3 交易者并不陌生，但带杠杆定投的操作方式则相对比较陌生。LiquiFlow 使用 SuperFluid 的流式资金流构建了：使用 AAVE 开杠杆，使用 Uniswap 买入的杠杆定投功能。\n\n这种投资方式通过杠杆加高了短期波动的同时又以定投对冲长期风险。在特定条件下，盈利效率会比单纯的杠杆仓位或定投高出很多。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/npUuSWz2wlOdznQo4lJeY.png?height=576&width=1056)\n\n### 9. Dyve\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/dyve-rdhug>\n\n目前 NFT 金融还处于一个早期发展阶段。虽已有数个 NFT 抵押借贷平台，但对于 NFT 这个百亿市场来说，显然还有更多的发展空间。\n\nDyve 由此诞生，是一个 NFT 做空平台。\n\n用户比起单纯地长期持有 NFT（多头），可以通过将 NFT 以一定额的超额抵押和过期期限来出借给做空者以获得额外的收益。\n\n但做空者无需归还同一个 NFT，只需要归还同一系列中的任意一个NFT或者放弃抵押品就能结束一个做空周期。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QevtnQYV5M8LV_ZBboi7i.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n### 10. Granted\n\n**链接**：<https://ethglobal.com/showcase/granted-vtxne>\n\nGranted 是一个项目资助管理平台。作为一个资助者，Granted 使用 Unlock 协议来管理资助者的资助资金管理，项目方或团队也可以申请拨款资金。申请者的信息会通过 EPNS 的信息推送服务推送给资助者，而资助者设定的里程碑则会由其选定的团队来完成。\n\n资助资金将会根据设定的里程碑规则发放，如月活用户分别达到一千、一万、十万将会分别获得三分之一的总拨款。除了资助者对于项目实际进度的审查以外，所有行为都在链上进行，从而能让整个资助过程公开透明且去中心化并具有更高的公平性。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8pedEHTwBOa_aWyBnirUY.png?height=783&width=1280)\n\n### 11. sDao\n\n**链接**： <https://ethglobal.com/showcase/sdao-sorition-based-dao-gjcbr>\n\n最近的热议话题之一，是对 DAO 中心化的担忧。sDao 给出了他们的解答：抽签式民主（Sortition）。抽签式民主是指从想参与投票的所有人中选取一部人并给予实际投票权来决定一件事情。\n\n对于 DAO 来说，DAO 可以设置准入门槛，在所有达成准入门槛并申请的人中选出一定百分比的人来进行公平投票。这种投票方式的缺点也很明显：其可能会被女巫攻击，即一个人拥有多个账号。\n\n这种治理模式也变相扼杀了看好项目且有治理需求的巨鲸的大量资金的涌入（除非通过女巫攻击），从而让 DAO 的治理代币失去大量需求。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eR_Xd7xWEq38_RJVP0u4Q.png?height=1600&width=1508)\n\n### 12. [Eth.id](http://Eth.id)\n\n**链接**：<https://ethglobal.com/showcase/eth-id-heoay>\n\nEthid 是一个中心化的 ENS 扩展项目，通过注册 aaa./eth./id 的子域名，用户就拥有了一个可自定义的社交身份信息界面。用户使用 .xyz, .io, .net等域名，很多时候是由于 .com 域名的高昂的购买/使用费用。Ethid是ENS域名的扩展，并能提供用户信息界面。\n\n目前项目主体部署在中心化的 AWS 上。但对于这类可放弃动态存储的项目，部署到 IPFS 再使用 ENS 作为网页入口会更加符合 web3 的去中心化精神。从用户体验上来说，两者唯一的不同是用户每次修改信息都需上传 IPFS + 设置新 IPFS 链接到 ENS （并支付 gas）。但这两个步骤可在后台进行，并由用户单次确认设置 ENS 时支付的 gas ，从而带来可接受的流畅体验。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dYKy2lrqeq3mC2YNo9xM1.png?height=1600&width=920)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658284947, "digest": "EuH1wtNIlv3E_XOkY3MXEr2TApYqZUYkRUbqUmSRtJw", "contributor": "0x70562F91075eea0f87728733b4bbe00F7e779788"}

The abundant sunshine makes the sea bluer, and the seaside is quite lush. They are aquatic plants that grow along the coast.\n\nThere is a water plant that he doesn't want to be in a group, and he always looks out to the sea alone and thinks. Imagine what's on the other side of the sea.\n\nIn the evening, he listened to the singing of the waves, hoping that the wind would blow his mind away and drift away into the distance. Suddenly, another song interrupted his fantasy.\n\n\"La la la la... la la...\" A small fish swam here with bubbles and humming a song.\n\nXiaoyu found him, stopped, and asked him, \"Shui Cao, why are you looking at the sea alone?\"\n\nHe smiled and said, \"Little fish, I was thinking about what the other side of the sea would look like.\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qbNGgWVldv2JASyVKVuX6.png?height=270&width=397)\n\n\"Oh.\" Xiaoyu spit out a bubble, \"Maybe it's still the sea, because the sea is very big.\"\n\n\"Little fish, I believe that there must be another scene on the other side of the sea.\" Waterweed said with infinite fascination.\n\nXiaoyu said: \"Then when I grow up, I'll come and have a look.\"\n\nThe waves are dancing happily again.\n\nA spring has passed, and the little fish has only grown a little. However, she fell in love with water plants.\n\nEvery afternoon, small fish dare to swim from the bottom of the sea to the surface. Swim to the side of the grass. Because of the harsh sun in the morning, the little fish was too small for his body to bear. But every now and then, she would slip up in disobedience at noon, spit at the water plants, and talk intimately for a while. It was not until the sun scalded the fish that she reluctantly swam back to the bottom of the sea.\n\nTheir love is helpless, the water grass can't give the little fish a hug, because he is not a water grass in the sea; the little fish can't give the water grass a kiss, because she is not a bird on the shore.\n\nShe could only look at him and smile and smile at him. Sing to him and pop a bubble. They talked about the other side of the sea together. The water plant said that there must be a lot of small fish there, and the small fish said that there must be countless water plants there.\n\nOne day, the grandfather of the big fish said to the little fish: \"Your love has no results, you are not a water plant, and he is not a small fish.\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ecqNK3sDyS9nQ80sBurZV.png?height=266&width=474)\n\nXiaoyu wagged his tail vigorously, \"I don't care! I don't care!\"\n\nGrandpa Dayu sighed and continued: \"I can use magic to restore your memory to eight seconds, you only love him for eight seconds.\"\n\nXiaoyu shouted: \"No! Even if I become a fishbone, I will still love him, remember him!\" Xiaoyu turned and swam away.\n\nShe swam to the side of the water plants, she did not speak. She was crying all the time. She knew that water plants could not see.\n\n\"Silly little fish, why are you crying?\" Shui Cao asked distressedly.\n\nXiaoyu was surprised, \"How did you know?\"\n\nWaterweed smiled proudly, \"Fool, I stretched my roots into the sea and felt your tears. It's so warm.\"\n\nThe little fish burst into tears.\n\nWith the arrival of summer day by day, the sea water is getting hotter and hotter by the sun. Small fish are getting weaker and weaker due to frequent exposure to ultraviolet rays and immersion in warm seawater. The scales are also falling off.\n\nThe journey from the bottom of the sea to the surface of the sea is getting longer and longer, and the small fish are struggling more and more. Missing makes her crazy, she can't see him for a day. The summer sun makes the water plants grow taller and greener. Xiaoyu's eyes were full of green that fascinated her.\n\nXiaoyu heard that the parents of the aquatic plants wanted him to marry another aquatic plant in early autumn. She was crying hard on the bottom of the sea, and the fish passing by didn't even know she was crying. In this world, only water plants can feel the temperature of her crying. Xiaoyu burst out crying, and she cried all the water in her body.\n\nAt night, the little fish swam to the surface. Staring at the water plants madly. Both are speechless. They both understand the pain in each other's hearts. Only knowing is not annoying: \"I know, I know...\"\n\nAfter the little fish left, the mood of the water plants was difficult to calm down for a long time. He couldn't forget Xiaoyu's desperate eyes and broken scales. He made a big decision: he wanted to find a way to pull out the roots, plunge into the sea, and be with the little fish. Whether doing so is life or death.\n\nThe next day, the sun was particularly strong. The aquatic plants had to crawl on the wetlands to avoid sunburning themselves. He wants to tell Xiaoyu his decision at night.\n\nAt dusk, the water plants straighten their bodies. Not far away, he seemed to see a small fish, motionless there.\n\nWave after wave of sea water patted the little fish ashore and stopped beside the aquatic plants.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CoR8Qej4ah9tFqJQRK6sF.png?height=266&width=439)\n\nIs it a small fish? ! Oh, no. It's the corpse of a small fish.

Web3.0 定义为后端生产关系的创新，其缘起于对 Web2.0 超级平台模式生态不平衡的变革。然而，随着互联网变成各行各业的基础设施，我们可以预见 Web3.0 未来不会是仅仅对于某一个特定行业的改变和替代，而是为各行各业发展提出「生态共荣」成长模型的解决方案，其核心特征包括开放（代码开源，降低技术门槛；进入身份无门槛，嫁接全社会优质资源）、共荣（基于 Token 经济学实现生态各个参与方利益一致）、核心环节自治（基于区块链不可篡改的信任机制，让组织进步更加可持续）。长期看，我们认为更自由、利益分配更合理的生产关系有望推动新一轮自下而上的科技创新。\n\nDAO 是生态共荣模型的核心载体。相比于历史上类似的合作组织、开源软件开发等类似的组织形式，Web3.0 提出一套新的解决方案，就是去中心化自治组织（简称 DAO），又可以被称为基于某种协作目的的社区。DAO 的整体生态目前可分为 DAO 底层基础设施、应用类 DAO，基础设施为 DAO 建设的辅助工具，未来破圈还需仰仗应用类 DAO 的发展。DAO 目前处于初级发展阶段，根据 DeepDAO 数据显示，总拥有的资产总额今年 6 月达 85 亿美元，呈现良好发展态势，活跃参与社区治理的人数为 67.8 万人，超过 100 人持有治理代币的 DAO 组织为 629 个。\n\n从 Uniswap DAO 的案例看社区共荣模型发展路径。任何生态型的产品（包含开发者、C 端用户、创作者、投资者等环节）最终都可以以 DAO 的形式进入生态共荣模型，但是好的产品仍然是生态共荣模型的根基。我们将社区 DAO 的发展分为三个阶段：1.初期以打造产品为主，这时 DAO 与传统公司形态无异，需要创始团队前瞻决策，比如 Uniswap 初期重点打造基于 AMMs 的去中心化交易所产品；2.逐步培养社区，可以开始建立 Token 激励体系，吸引一部分社区重要成员参与治理；3.Exit to Community，将社区核心治理权通过 Token 归还给生态，创始团队可能仍是中心级的存在，但没有绝对掌控权，比如 Uniswap 将其代币 UNI 大部分发行给了社区，并通过 UNI 激励社区成员参与治理。\n\nDAO 目前问题和风险。DAO 目前仍处于早期阶段，面临诸多问题，例如在全球大多数地方仍未获得监管认可，运营存在法律风险；核心决策机制不完善，具体又可分为体系内风险（如少数人合谋，多数欺负少数）和体系外风险（比如贿赂选票等），风险潜在解决方案包括改变驱动的治理形式、投票方法或规则来解决。我们建议用开放心态看待 DAO 的发展，在发展中解决问题，或许是 DAO 未来正确发展之路。\n\n### 风险\n\nDAO 组织形式不受监管法律认可风险；决策机制不完善导致运行失败风险；代码漏洞、体制机制不健全导致金库被攻击风险。\n\n### Web3.0 缘起是建立更公平、平等的生产关系\n\nWeb3.0 是基于区块链技术，具有去中心化和 Token 经济激励体系的新型生产关系，是下一代互联网迭代方向。在元宇宙世界中，革新同时发生在前端与后端。与 AR/VR 等前端创新不同，Web3.0 更加聚焦后端生产关系的更新，随着区块链、加密货币、去中心化应用、DeFi 等生态逐步成熟，Web3.0 迅速崛起。2022 年 3 月，美国总统拜登签署了行政令\\[1\\]，在对 Web3.0 进行审慎监管同时强调美国必须引领 Web3.0 趋势发展，也侧面说明行业趋势和重要性。\n\nWeb3.0 必要性缘起于对 Web2.0 生产关系革命。在对 Web3.0 必要性的讨论中，比较经典理论来自 a16z 投资人 Chris Dixon\\[2\\]：他认为 Web2.0 平台的发展遵循 S 型增长曲线，而 Web2.0 的不平衡来源于，Web2.0 超级平台和与上下游的关系（含上游内容生产者、下游用户等）会随着其发展规模的变化而变化——在超级平台成长初期，总的蛋糕在不断变大，平台和上下游生存空间也一起变大。但随着时间推移，当超级平台用户增长停滞的时候，随着其对于利润持续追逐，超级平台自然就会挤压上下游利润，「正和博弈」变为「零和博弈」。这就导致，上游端，创作者对利益分配不均的状况不满；下游端，用户数据隐私等各项权益无法保障。因此，缘起于 Web2.0 超级平台主导生态必然的不平衡性，我们需要一个新的范式，这就是 Web3.0——基于区块链的，去中心化和代币经济激励的新的生产关系。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658283025410.png)\n\n*图表：互联网超级平台的发展规律*\n\n*资料来源：Chris Dixon《Why Decentralization Matters》(2018)，中金公司研究部*\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658283031746.png)\n\n*图表：从 Web1.0 到 Web3.0 的发展过程*\n\n*资料来源：Shermin Voshmgir《Token Economy: How the Web3.0 reinvents the Internet》(2020)，中金公司研究部*\n\n以这样的思维模式理解 Web3.0 生产关系的必要性是没有问题的，因为这是一种更兼顾公平和平等的生产关系。然而，我们都知道投资的核心是追求技术创新带来的效率提升。那么，Web3.0 的生产关系效率提升点在哪里？把用户数据所有权归还给用户是否必然造成系统整体效率的降低？我们认为，从效率提升维度来看，Web3.0 核心承载点在于生态共荣模型（Ownership Economy）。\n\n### 生态共荣模型助力 Web3.0 高速、高质量发展\n\n如果说 Web2.0 使得互联网本身壮大成为了一个重要行业，随着互联网越来越成为社会发展的基础设施，Web3.0 引领将不是单一行业创新——其预示着互联网将渗透进各行各业，且 Web3.0 新的生产关系或将成为长期互联网全新社会「元宇宙」发展的底层生产关系。也就是说，从 Web3.0 的革命性来讲，Web3.0 虽然缘起于想改变超级平台中心化的生产关系，但其背后思考远景更大，其意在基于区块链技术，建立一种新型社会协作模式和利益分配机制，我们将其定义为「生态共荣模型」，而这种社区型生态共荣模型特点有开放生态、共荣、核心环节自治。\n\n* 开放生态：任何人都可以给生态发展做贡献，Web3.0 采用底层代码开源等形式，不存在数据垄断，同时嫁接最广泛的社会资源（包括人才流动，无时间和空间的束缚）。\n* 共荣：Token 经济学、博弈理论等体系是生态共荣模型的必要条件。例如，社区生态每个参与者（包括开发团队、投资者、创作者、用户等）都是生态内 Token 的持有者，这些参与者具有一致的共同利益，能够共同推动生态发展。\n* 核心环节自治：基于智能合约等形式，DAO 的组织形态可以实现核心管理和利益分配环节自治，避免人为操作导致的寻租空间和利益冲突等问题，从而提升去中心化治理的可操作性。\n\n生态共荣模型驱动比特币生态发展。在比特币的生态中，比特币（其本质就是维系生态的核心纽带——Token）让开发者、使用者和投资者形成利益一致的共同体，并共同为比特币生态的前进而努力（每个人都可以成为比特币的营销者），而其背后的激励制度（例如挖矿奖励比特币）则吸引大量矿工成为生态支持者。由此，生态共荣模型是比特币能在过去 10 年中迅速崛起的核心原因之一。假设比特币由任何一家中心化公司发行，可能很难达到如此高度。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282982354.png)\n\n*图表：比特币的生态共荣模型*\n\n*资料来源：Packy McCormick《The Dao of DAOs》(2021)，中金公司研究部*\n\n### 生态共荣模型是对传统公司制度的民主化\n\n类比过去 300 年国家政体民主化进程，以 DAO 为载体的生态共荣模型可以视为新的民主化公司制度。国家制度从封建主义发展到资本主义，再从资本主义发展到社会主义，政体民主化程度进一步提高。类比来看，生态共荣模型在「公司控制生态，股东最终控制公司」基础上进行了更加民主化的革新，最终，「生态参与者共同决定生态未来走向，分享生态发展红利」将成为生态共荣模型的长期目标。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282956817.png)\n\n*图表：公司制度发展历程*\n\n*资料来源：中金公司研究部*\n\n长期来看，更开放的环境；利益更一致、更平衡的体系；更公开透明的分配制度有希望催生更广泛的技术创新。历史上看，当工人被赋予更多自由，更好的激励，一个新的自下而上创新的环境被创造出来，从而驱动更多技术创新驱动工厂效率持续提升。Netflix 的 CEO Reed Hastings 就曾经提出一个基于人才密度，取消管控，催生自由创意的独特管理模型\\[3\\]，也是 Netflix 持续创新的基础管理体系。长期来看，我们认为 Web3.0 的生态共荣模型底层逻辑也是类似的，其更开放环境，利益一致的体系和更公开透明制度有望引领下一波科技创新浪潮，从而引领 Web3.0 生态效率进一步提升。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282932814.png)\n\n*图表：Reed Hastings 提出的 Netflix 独特管理模型*\n\n*资料来源：Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer《No Rules Rules》(2020)，中金公司研究部*\n\n## 生态共荣模型的历史沿革：开放合作，相得益彰\n\n### 第一种形态：合作组织模式\n\n合作组织是指成员为了达到某种社会、经济、文化目的而自愿形成的自制组织，所有权归大家共有。根据国际合作社联盟（ICA）的数据显示，截至 2020 年，全球有 12% 的人口加入过合作组织，全球最大的 300 个合作组织资金周转规模达到 2.1 万亿美元，全球合作组织提供就业机会达到 2.8 亿美元。\n\n最有名的合作组织是之一 Visa。Visa 最初来自 1958 年美国银行推出的具有循环信用功能的贷记卡 BankAmericard。从 1966 年开始，Visa 在信用卡业务出具规模后，为了应对当年成立的竞争对手 MasterCharge（即万事达卡的前身），开始授权加州以外的银行发卡经营；此后还授权给加拿大、日本、英国、法国等家的银行。再往后业务规模进一步扩大，Visa 与美国国内授权的银行成立 NBI 组织，海外被授权的银行则成立了 IBANCO 组织。1976 年 NBI 和 IBANCO 合并成为 Visa 国际组织。\n\nVISA 国际组织是世界上最大的信用卡国际合作组织之一，是一个由全世界银行参与的、非盈利的国际性组织，由会员单位共同拥有，会员由银行等金融机构组成，共同建立起一个全球的支付和金融服务的网络。虽然 2008 年 Visa 在 IPO 以后，决策权落至独立的董事会，但不可否认，截至 2022 年 7 月 15 日，Visa 的市值超过 3900 亿美元，曾经的合作组织模式是具备一定功劳的，能够最大化使得不同主体更高效协作，从而创造更大价值。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282904358.png)\n\n*图表：Visa 组织发展历程*\n\n*资料来源：36 氪，新浪财经，腾讯财经，Visa 公司公告，中金公司研究部*\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282898786.png)\n\n*图表：Visa 创造了过去十几年金融业市值增长之最*\n\n*资料来源：Wind，中金公司研究部*\n\n然而合作组织在发展过程中也存在诸多问题：启动成本、竞争态势、治理体系等。\\[4\\]\n\n* 冷启动困难：合作组织初始期比较难启动，俗话说「三个和尚没水喝」，「大锅饭」模式很难激发大家创始的积极性。相反，传统中心化组织由于一开始就有明确的目的（比如募资以实现收益最大化），反而更容易达成目标。\n* 不一定竞争得过效率更高的传统公司：如果碰到激烈的行情竞争，在合作组织的资金资源、效率都不占优势的情况下，传统中心化公司若真使用铁腕手段与之竞争，合作组织很难形成合力与之抗衡。\n* 治理体系设计难：合作组织的治理体系比较难设计，如何高效、专业达成决策结果是难点，之前的许多合作组织最终都延续了传统公司的层级治理结构。\n\n### 第二种形态：开源软件生态\n\nWeb3.0 的底层基础设施的核心特征之一就是代码开源属性，我们认为其与传统开源软件生态的发展也有一定类似性。从 1990 年以来，PC 操作系统由闭源的 Windows 统领，然而，基于开源协作体系的 Linux 在过去 20 年中不断发展，并在 Android 操作系统（基于 Linux）开始占据移动互联网市占率首位后（占比超 40%），证明了开源软件生态体系的成功。\n\nLinux 是一套开放源代码程序的、可以自由传播的类 Unix 操作系统软件，诞生于 1991 年 10 月 5 日，由芬兰学生 Linus Torvalds 和后来陆续加入的众多爱好者共同开发完成。开发 Linux 系统的目的就是建立不受任何商业化软件版权制约的、全世界都能自由使用的类 Unix 操作系统兼容产品。在过去的 20 年里，Linux 系统主要被应用于服务器端、嵌入式开发和 PC 桌面 3 大领域，其中服务器领域是重中之重。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282832334.png)\n\n*图表：全球操作系统市占率（%）*\n\n*资料来源：statcounter，中金公司研究部*\n\n开源软件生态能够胜出的原因：软件开发天然具有流程化特点，适合多人按一定流程协作，而开源体系则能够嫁接全社会最优质的资源，以供养这套流程化操作。正如 a16z 合伙人 Chris Dixon 所说\\[5\\]：「闭源软件推出时一般相对完善，但其进步速度和其雇佣员工资源相关；而开源软件推出时经常像个半成品，但是随着时间发展，其能够最广泛利用社会优质资源从而获得指数级别增长。」\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282812792.png)\n\n*图表：开源生态图*\n\n*资料来源：CSDN，中金公司研究部*\n\n另一个类似开源软件模式的典型案例是维基百科（Wikipedia）。最初的互联网的崛起并不是在消费端进行效率提升，而是在生产端进行效率提升——满足了用户追求言论表达自由的需求。维基百科的前身是 Nupedia，这是一个 Web 版的在线百科全书计划，其邀请众多不同领域专家成为编辑，但是速度很慢，一年才发表不到 24 个词条。而 Wikipedia（2001 年推出）则采用类似 Linux 的开源编辑模式，任何人都可以在前人的基础上编辑。这样的协作模式在最初可能被认为是没有质量的，然而事实上在互联网上先放出一个错误答案很容易得到他人的修改进而得到正确答案。Wikipedia 成立一个月后就产生了 600 个词条，数量多而且质量高，1 年后词条到 2 万个，两年达到 10 万个。2003 年，创始人 Wales 把 Wikipedia 设立成为非营利组织（Not for profit），到目前为止维基百科主要的商业模式为用户捐赠。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282789069.png)\n\n*图表：维基百科发展时间线*\n\n*资料来源：Medium，中金公司研究部*\n\nLinux 和 Wikipedia 成功证明了两点：1.相比于封闭的公司，民间拥有更多真正优秀的工程师；2. 开源模式也可以产生高效的协作。人们对开源模式一直存在误解，认为其很容易被破坏，因为每个人都可以编辑。但是从另一个方面想，开源模式使得每个人都可以修改内容（内容上的错误不会永久存在），并且开放、协作的模式使得不存在单一的权威可以对内容施加控制。这也许可以视为 Web3.0 时代里 DAO 这种去中心化组织的理论雏形之一。\n\n然而，开源软件生态最大问题是经济激励不足。开源社区、开源基金会等组织均须要将传统商业公司的捐赠作为主要的收入来源，而传统商业公司的捐赠并不是无条件的，他们更多想依赖开源社区成功孵化商业产品。而对于开源社区内部开发者，开源组织内部并没有一套成型的激励机制，目前不求回报式的无条件贡献内容还是开发者在开源组织内发布内容最常见的形式。相比来看，Web3.0 的生态则利用加密货币体系解决了经济激励不足的问题。\n\n## 生态共荣模型核心组织载体——DAO\n\n### Web3.0 提出全新的组织解决方案——DAO\n\n合作组织和开源生态作为生态共荣模型的早期产物，二者存在一定的优缺点。二者的优点在于能够尽可能使得参与方利益一致，并最大化嫁接全社会优质资源。但缺点也很明显：主要在于缺乏激励机制，难以形成合力，同时治理体系也较难设计。\n\nWeb3.0 则基于区块链技术以及目前已经建立相对成熟的去中心化金融体系（DeFi），提出一种兼具合作组织和开源生态的优点，并改善其缺点的解决方案——DAO。一方面，Web3.0 底层开发、开源属性能够嫁接全社会最优质的资源，能够从价值观角度使得参与生态的用户形成一致（不一致就可以分叉）的共识；另一方面，基于 Token 的经济体系，Web3.0 能够使得开发团队、用户和投资者等各方利益达成一致，且从博弈理论角度来看，社区本身欣欣向荣的发展是大家都盼望的事情（虽然不可调和的分歧可以通过分叉解决，但必定损伤每一位生态所有者的经济利益）。\n\n### 什么是 DAO？\n\n顾名思义，DAO 是 Decentralized Autonomous Organization 的简称，意为「去中心化自治组织」，核心意思有三层，也就是这三个词语各自代表的意思。\n\n* Decentralized（去中心化）：按照以太坊创始人 Vitalik 的定义，去中心化意味着没有一个实体可以控制所有组织内部所有的操作流程。但是再往下深究，去中心化并不完全是无中心化。由此，Web3.0 所言的去中心化是相对 Web2.0 而言的，并不是绝对的去中心化。如果将去中心化分成建筑、组织和逻辑三个维度来看，区块链以及 DAO 所说的去中心化很可能是建筑上（打破地理位置限制）、组织（权力分布）上的去中心化，而不是逻辑上去中心化（DAO 不能自由切换成两个同样的整体仍然良好运转）。\\[6\\]\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282727150.png)\n\n*图表：不同组织形态的区别*\n\n*资料来源：Vitalik Buterin 《The Meaning of Decentralization》(2017)，中金公司研究部*\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282721274.png)\n\n*图表：DAO 的去中心化是建筑、组织上的去中心化*\n\n*资料来源：Vitalik Buterin 《The Meaning of Decentralization》(2017)，中金公司研究部*\n\n* Autonomous 自治：DAO 的自治指执行和部分管理环节都利用智能合约负责，从而较少出现执行环节的权力寻租空间。Vitalik 曾经说过\\[7\\]，传统自动化是替代基层工人的流程化工作，而 DAO 自治也要替代传统公司的管理层机制（例如分配利益环节程序自治）。总而言之，DAO 的目的之一是尽量减少在决策和执行过程中的人为操作空间，以程序为基础获取大多数人的信任，从而提升组织运行的效率。\n* Organization 组织：其核心是解决协作的问题，这是 DAO 的基础属性。与 Web3.0 理念一脉相承的是，DAO 的组织内涵包括开放自由、利益平等等。\n\nDAO 又可以被称作是以某种特定协作目的，基于共识机制聚合而成的社区。DAO 是一种基于区块链技术的新的治理社区，是一种助力项目融资和分享利益的组织形式。相对传统公司组织形式，DAO 有去中心化、高度自治和组织协作的特点。\\[8\\]\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282677242.png)\n\n*图表：DAO 与传统公司形态的对比*\n\n*资料来源：Linda Xie《A beginner’s guide to DAOs》(2021)，中金公司研究部*\n\n我们可以从规模效应、网络效应、竞争能力、替换成本四个角度对比来看 DAO 的优缺点。\n\n* 规模效应：一般。DAO 能够最广泛使用全球优质人才和资源因此能够迅速做大规模。此外，其基于智能合约自治环节也使得公司运行本身成本较低（规模越大，IT 成本更低）。但整体而言，其规模效应相比传统公司并无绝对明显优势。\n* 网络效应：优秀。DAO 利用 Token 激励将开发者、创作者、用户和投资者等各方利益统一，基于博弈理论，使生态内部每一个人都有最大动力去提升 DAO 的价值，加速 DAO 的成长。此外，随着 DAO 所在生态的成熟，又会吸引更多用户、创作者、投资者、开发者等，从而形成更快飞轮循环。\n* 竞争能力：优秀。DAO 的分配机制更加公平平等，各方利益一致（且分配不会随着规模变化而变化），因此其一旦形成网络效应更加难以被改变。\n* 替换成本：一般。DAO 的代码底层都是开源的，任何不满意的社区生态用户都可以选择复制一个现有社区，替换成本不高。因此，DAO 的网络效应和竞争能力核心来自于真正满足了用户的需求，而不是来自数据或者代码的垄断。当然，持有人对于 Token 经济价值是吸引其停留在原有社区重要原有之一。\n\n#### DAO 的治理框架：目前协调和决策方式\n\n根据火币研究院的划分，DAO 的治理框架主要集中于「如何协调」以及「如何决策」两个核心步骤。针对「如何协调」的问题，可粗略地分为链上提案治理和链下提案治理，而我们知道 DAO 目前的核心决策方式是投票，那么「如何决策」的问题则重点解决采用何种投票机制。\n\n链上提案治理是 DAO 治理中最基本的环节，采用智能合约实现去中心化的治理流程，将治理机制写入代码，通常会通过代币持有者投票来决策。而链下提案治理则是一种辅助手段，通常采用在链下进行非正式的社区讨论，避免过多占用链上资源。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282631392.png)\n\n*图表：DAO 治理的核心问题*\n\n*资料来源：火币研究院《DAO 哪里了：简析 DAO 的发展历程及治理机制》（2021），PAKA Labs，Polkadot，中金公司研究部*\n\nDAO 的投票机制中最为简单的就是一通证代表一票（1T1V），但这个投票机制本身有不少缺陷，需要长期持续迭代。我们知道，追根溯源，传统意义上一个去中心化社区要通过治理方案理论上需要>50% 的 Token 持有份额者通过。然而这就导致几个问题：不是所有方案参与者都有兴趣参加（尤其是持有份额较低的人）、参与投票的人经验不足（乌合之众多而有能力者没有发言权）、提案在 Token 投票机制中没有轻重缓急之分、投票效率低等。因此针对这些问题出现了一些新的投票机制解决方案，流动民主、知识可提取投票有抬高具备专业知识专家投票决策地位的方案；信念投票、加权投票则对于投票者本身有重要程度的划分。整体来看，Web3.0 并不能逃避现实民主社会决策机制中各种问题，其反而是现实社会某种映射，因此对于如何保证决策流程公平公正、效率、专业等问题将是长期讨论和迭代的方向。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282603945.png)\n\n*图表：常见的 DAO 投票机制\\[9\\]*\n\n*资料来源：PAKA Labs，中金公司研究部*\n\n### DAO 市场概况和格局：工具铺路，应用兴起\n\nDAO 目前处于初级发展阶段。根据 DeepDAO 的数据显示，从资产规模来看，DAO 所拥有的资产总额从 2021 年 7 月一直处于增长状态，但近期有所波动和下滑，2022 年 6 月达 85 亿美元，资产管理规模超过 100 万美元的 DAO 组织仅有 98 个（统计基数为 2228 个 DAO）。从用户数来看，DeepDAO 所统计的 DAO 组织中，持有治理代币的人数为 370 万，活跃参与社区治理的人数为 67.8 万人，超过 100 人持有治理代币的 DAO 组织为 629 个。因此不管从资产规模还是用户数来看，DAO 组织形态目前还是以小体量团体为主。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282482269.png)\n\n*图表：DAO

工具属于辅助 DAO 运行的基础设施，是 DAO 能够兴起的必要条件，其能够帮助 DAO 解决创立、投票、争端解决、资产管理、人才招募等问题。此外，未来真正实现破圈的应该是具有不同职能的应用类 DAO，从而变革传统公司组织形式，打造更高效的协作方式。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282411175.png)\n\n*图表：DAO 整体生态格局*\n\n*资料来源：Coopahtroopa，中金公司研究部*\n\n* DAO 的基础设施：含 DAO 的底层操作系统及工具，底层操作系统为创建 DAO 社区提供不同的模板、框架和工具，通常提供智能合约和接口以促进去中心化社区的链上操作，使 DAO 的创建变得更加便捷，典型案例如 Aragon、MolochDAO 等。此外，目前有许多类似于工具箱的细分产品以支持 DAO 的运作，基本围绕社区的治理和代币系统等问题，如 Gnosis Safe（管理社区资产的钱包）、Snapshot（链下投票治理平台）、Discourse（链下论坛）、Tally（治理 dashboard，用于跟踪不同协议的链上投票历史）等。\n* 应用类 DAO：根据 DAO 组织不同的协作目的和职能，可以分成捐赠类 DAO、投资类 DAO、协议类 DAO、服务类 DAO、社交类 DAO、收藏类 DAO、媒体类 DAO 等。这些不同类型的应用 DAO 组织使得整个 DAO 生态变得愈发繁荣，实际上 DAO 是个组织框架，这个框架可以套用在任何领域的应用上，核心特征和目的就是去中心化。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282376246.png)\n\n*图表：应用类 DAO 组织实例*\n\n*资料来源：Coopahtroopa，中金公司研究部*\n\n## 从 Uniswap DAO 的案例看社区共荣模型发展路径\n\n生态共荣模型在网络效应和可持续性方面都有明显优势，但在如何驱动创业者完成冷启动角度仍然存在一定短板，比如早期公司面临很多重要得选择需要高效决策，且产品定位等都需要创始团队前瞻定位，因此我们认为社区生态模型并非适合初创企业。根据 Jesse Walden 的《Progressive Decentralization: A Playbook for Building Crypto Applications》文章所言，从初创企业到进入真正生态共荣模型，需要分三步走，分别是产品搭建、建设社区、Exit to community。\\[10\\]本章我们将去中心化交易生态 Uniswap 发展作为案例解析社区共荣模型的发展路径。\n\n### 产品搭建阶段——传统公司模型\n\n初创企业缘起和传统创业公司制度完全一样，创始团队需要聚焦建设一个优秀的产品。好的产品是社区生态的前提，Web3.0 的大前提是软件开源，所谓「前人栽树，后人乘凉」，写代码的过程可以类比乐高积木，初创企业可以很快搞定技术基础搭建的问题，聚焦产品功能开发，如 Compound 就参考了 MakerDAO（包括智能合约、Token 发行、CDP 工具等）来构建自己的基础设施。这个阶段，去中心化不是项目要追求的核心目标，核心目标应是产品本身，公司也会像传统初创企业一样依赖 VC 进行融资着力打造产品（早期的项目也需要专业的投资者）。\n\n以去中心化交易所 Uniswap 为例，其成立于 2018 年 11 月，创立者是 Hayden Adams，最早创立的 Uniswap 是公司形态，且 2020 年获得了 VC a16z 的 2.2 亿美元融资。然而，从产品形式来看，Uniswap 拥有与传统中心化交易所如 Coinbase 截然不同的产品理念：相对于 Coinbase 等中心化交易所，Uniswap 的产品理念融入了更多 Web3.0 去中心化的理念。Uniswap 基于以太坊平台打造，并且基于 AMMs 的流动性池方案形成交易，任何人都可以成为 Uniswap 的流动性提供者。此外，Uniswap 在交易中收取的交易费用（最开始为 0.3%），这笔费用最后会全部奖励给 AMM 体系内的流动性提供者，而 Coinbase 的交易费用则归为公司营收，利润则作为股东回报的根基。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282336880.png)\n\n*图表：Coinbase 和 Uniswap 对比*\n\n*资料来源：Coinbase，Uniswap，FINTECH RUMINATIONS，中金公司研究部*\n\n### 建设社区——DAO 的前身\n\n当产品相对成熟后，产品开发者就可以考虑利用经济激励设计和 Token 经济体系打造社区生态。思考的路径核心是两点：费率和 Token 分配体系。一方面，项目可以考虑从费率等维度考虑激励创作者、用户等各方面参与程度（比如提升创作者分成、降低参与用户费率），但是存在一定的权衡——「提升创作者分成与降低参与用户费率」二者无法兼得（因此 Uniswap 就定在 0.3% 以实现相对合理的平衡）。另一方面，可以考虑逐步向一部分社区核心用户发放 Token 方式鼓励他们参与社区治理，分享社区收益。这时候创始团队仍然对产品方向保持控制能力，但逐步通过公开透明的方式向社区让渡治理的权力，并不断测试、寻找更好的平衡和实现机制。\n\n这里就不得不提及 Uniswap 的分叉案例 Sushiswap，Sushiswap 可以看作是「建设社区」阶段的典型案例，目前在去中心化交易所市场份额占比第五。Sushiswap 产生的背景是，Uniswap 交易量在快速上涨，但却迟迟没有推出自己的 Token 体系。这就导致了几个问题：1. 对核心的流动性提供用户挽留力度不足，用户可以直接拿钱走人，无法体现长期价值；2. 对早期承受了更高风险的流动性提供用户没有给予相应的利益，随着盘子增大，他们的利益会被进一步稀释。\n\nSushiswap 发现了机会，2020 年 8 月复制了 Uniswap 核心代码（Web3.0 开源属性降低了代码开发的门槛）的 Sushiswap 推出，发行了自己的 Token SUSHI，并宣布在 0.3% 交易费率中，将 0.25% 分给流动性提供者，剩下 0.05% 兑换成 SUSHI 分给所有的 SUSHI 持有者。因此 Sushiswap 引入 Token 激励机制用来促进社区生态的发展，意味着即使用户没有提供流动性也可以因为持有 SUSHI 份额而获得激励，实际上是一荣俱荣——这提高了用户对社区本身的依存度。但是，Sushiswap 到这一步还不算是真正意义上的 DAO，因为当时其 Token 只分享了经济利益，没有分享治理权力，现在用户则可以通过持有 SUSHIPOWAH（可以用 SUSHI 兑换）来投票。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282298493.png)\n\n*图表：近一年内 A 类去中心化交易所（DEX）交易量份额*\n\n*资料来源：Nomics，中金公司研究部；注：数据截至 2022 年 7 月 11 日*\n\n早期 Binance 发展也有类似结构。Binance 在 2017 年 ICO 发行 1500 万美元 BNB Token，并宣布 Token 持有人可以在交易费率上打折，且 Token 持有人可以使用 Token 在交易所获得更多曝光（比如曝光自己要 ICO 的项目），同时 Binance 会定期销毁 BNB 来控制供给量来防止通胀。虽然 BNB 没有治理权，但是这种形式让社区在经济利益上达成一致，是建设社区共荣模型的重要一步。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282282142.png)\n\n*图表：近一年内 A 类中心化交易所（CEX）交易量份额*\n\n*资料来源：Nomics，中金公司研究部；注：数据截至 2022 年 7 月 11 日*\n\n### Exit to community——社区共荣模型形成\n\n随着产品成熟、社区生态成型，最后一步就是 Exit to community，其重要的一步是将 Token 发行、销毁等激励体系、社区治理体系写进智能合约，让社区实现真正的核心自治，而核心决策权则回归 DAO。当然，初始团队仍然在社区拥有很大的影响力，比如以太坊的创始人 Vitalik，在关键时刻仍将不得不做出重要的决定，带领社区前行（比如 2016 年以太坊 The DAO 的硬分叉），但是社区底层的治理权已经回归 DAO，社区共荣模型建成。\n\n在 Sushiswap 以及其他 swap 项目都开始发行 Token 后，Uniswap 也做出了自己的动作。2020 年 9 月，Uniswap 宣布发行 UNI，共十亿枚，并正式转型为 DAO。根据 UNI 的分配方案，最初的四年中，大部分（60%）的 UNI 归属于社区，团队则获得 21.51% 的 UNI。但为了尽量避免有些用户使用消极策略持有 UNI 的情况（不做诸如社区治理、提供流动性等贡献，仅持有 UNI，相当于躺着赚钱），Uniswap 在四年后将对 UNI 开启永续通胀率，每年通胀 2%，这样一来这些消极的用户为了使手里的 UNI 不贬值，会有动力去做对社区有价值的事情。\n\n同时，在 UNI 的分配方案中，充分考虑了早期用户的利益。2020 年 9 月的 UNI 分配方案中，曾经的流动性提供者、用户和 SOCKS 持有者（Uniswap 发布的一种 NFT 袜子，可兑换实物），可以立即认领 UNI 的 15%；每个曾经调用过 Uniswap v1 或 v2 合约的地址都可以申请 400 UNI（相当于空投）；SOCKS 持有者可领 1000UNI。剩下的 43% 的 UNI 供应将存在社区的「社区金库」中，通过贡献者捐赠、社区提案、流动性挖矿和其他计划持续分配。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282238806.png)\n\n*图表：最初四年 UNI 的分配份额*\n\n*资料来源：Uniswap，中金公司研究部*\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282233622.png)\n\n*图表：10 年通胀后 UNI

的治理环节的决策流程可以分为三步：热度确认、共识确认、提案治理。每个环节所需参与投票的 UNI 总数不同：热度确认和共识确认是链下治理，属于链上治理前的准备工作，用来确认提案是否具有上链的价值，否则浪费链上资源，提案治理才是真正的链上决策。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282179181.png)\n\n*图表：Uniswap 治理流程*\n\n*资料来源：Uniswap，中金公司研究部*\n\n### Exit to community 或将对传统 IPO 形成替代效应\n\n传统 IPO 资本化体系背后的认知是：投资者相信的是方法论，就是用一套科学方法论去估值，但这种方式更强调专业框架体系，却往往忽视了产品本身内在价值；而 Web3.0 应用资本化 Exit to community 提供一种新的视角：即相信社区成员才真正懂这个产品内容价值，投资者也应该成为社区一部分（通过加密货币投资)。长期来看，其或对传统的 IPO 市场造成一定替代效应。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658282145092.png)\n\n*图表：Exit to community（社区共荣）或将对传统 IPO 形成替代效应*\n\n*资料来源：Nathan Schneider《Startups Need a New Option: Exit to Community》(2019)，中金公司研究部*\n\n## 问题和风险：决策机制仍然有待完善\n\n### DAO 目前在世界大多数地方仍然不受法律保障\n\nDAO 目前法律实体还处于灰色地带。目前 DAO 是否具有法律实体的正当性还没得到政府监管的完全确认。有别于传统公司形态，没有一个人能像传统的 CEO 或高管团队那样对 DAO 行使控制权，诸如 DAO 应如何报税、纳税或签署具有法律约束力的合同等问题一直存在疑问。传统公司的注册机制实际上是在法律上界定了「让人们了解是在与谁打交道」，这是传统概念中经济活动的重要基础之一，但是 DAO 目前无法界定这一点。这种在法律实体上的不确定性其实也增加了 DAO 本身运作的不确定性。\n\n美国怀俄明州政策「松绑」。2021 年 7 月 1 日美国怀俄明州投票通过关于允许 DAO 在该州正式注册的法案\\[11\\]，旨在允许 DAO 被州政府特许和认可，可以注册成为一种独特形式的 LLCs，且有限责任公司可转型为 DAO。2021 年 7 月 4 日，去中心化自治组织 CryptoFed DAO 被怀俄明州国务卿办公室认定为美国第一个合法 DAO。从目的来看，怀俄明州的这个法案可以视为 DAO 希望与法律机构建立正式关系，并在更稳固的基础上与监管互动。从监管的角度看，怀俄明州其实是从用户保护角度出发的，DAO 被视为 LLC 实则是一种保护，如果没有这种保护，DAO 也可以被视为普通合伙企业，那么一旦发生风险，成员对 DAO 的任何义务或行为都要承担连带责任（这点类似从无限责任公司到有限责任公司发展）。\n\n### DAO 决策流程目前仍有缺陷\n\n以太坊创始人 Vitalik 曾经说过：「虽然区块链和加密货币最开始的愿景是利用基数逃离现实中治理机制缺陷，但实际上却活生生复制了这些缺陷。加密货币不过是现实社会一个更大范围的映射。」也就是说在现实社会民主施行机制的难题，在 DAO 领域其实仍有许多问题需要解决，其中又主要可以分为两大类型风险：即体系内风险（体制、机制不健全等），以及体系外风险（行贿、收买选票等风险）。\n\n#### 体系内风险：体系本身的问题\n\n目前 DAO 的核心决策机制仍然是基于治理代币持有权为核心基础，然而这套机制本身会带来一些问题：少数人合谋、多数欺负少数、利益冲突。\n\n* 少数人合谋（「巨鲸问题」）：目前 DAO 的核心决策机制仍然是以治理代币持有权为核心基础，其明面上是去中心化的，但背后可能被少数「富有的」持币人把控。在 Token 体系中，大量的小份额代币持有者似乎没有足够动力去参加投票，例如，历史上，以太坊 The DAO 社区治理提案参与率从未超过 10%。\n* 多数欺负少数：代币投票治理以牺牲社区其他部分的利益（少数）为代价，赋予大多数代币持有者利益。一个具备协议的社区往往由不同价值观、愿景和目标的成员组成，这些成员中也包含不持有代币的人。然而，显然投票只赋予了代币持有者权力，而这些人一般会以代币价值增长为目标。\n* 利益冲突：如果富有的代币持有者还同时持有其他平台的代币，那么会暴露利益冲突。\n\n针对体系内风险的解决方案：针对少数人合谋的问题，小份额的用户可以采用委托代理投票的形式，把他们手里的投票权委托给自己信任的社区成员（类似代议制选举议员）。比如有些 DAO 采用流动民主机制，社区成员有权利委托受信任的成员，同时也可以随时撤回委托，流动性比代议制要强。这种方案同时也可减轻「利益冲突」的问题，因为流动民主不再完全是投票权与 Token 完全绑定的状态。\n\n#### 体系外风险：被攻击风险\n\n更难处理的是，DAO 可能存在被组织操纵选举的风险，即贿赂投票人。贿赂风险出发点在于被贿赂人的利益权衡，虽然贿赂选票会带来对社区本身的伤害，但是如果贿赂者给予被贿赂人的利益大于被贿赂者修改选票对社区治理的影响大小，那么被贿赂者确实有动力接受贿赂。因此这种情况一般发生在持币额较小的代币持有者身上，在他们看来，反正他们的话语权「微不足道」，接受贿赂对社区也没什么伤害。\n\n* 第一种贿赂方案：典型案例为包装合约，吸收用户的 XYZ 代币（包装合约用 WXYZ 换），并承诺给予他们股利，包装合约则向外通过拍卖吸收到的 XYZ 代币治理权赚取收益，以支付股利。\n* 第二种贿赂方案：将用户持有 Token 享有的利润分享权与治理权分开，典型案例为 DeFi 借贷平台。借款人拥有没有经济利益的治理权，贷款人没有治理权的经济利益，因此借款人容易被操纵。\n* Dark DAO：DAO 本身也可以用来攻击 DAO——一种去中心化的组织，可以不透明地在链上买票，具体的操作为利用受信任的硬件与 DAO 结合，允许用户自己证明他们正在运行投票购买者的「恶意钱包」的代码 / 程序以换取付款（这个过程是完全隐私的，外界看不到）。当达到投票购买者的预设阈值之后（比如 Token 数额），程序会根据投票买家的命令自动对某个提案进行投票，并向投票买家发送收据，投票买家再对投票用户付款即可。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202207/842-1658281435181.png)\n\n*图表：Dark DAO 运行流程（受信任的硬件以英特尔 SGX 为例）*\n\n*资料来源：Philip Daian, Tyler Kell, Ian Miers and Ari Juels《On-Chain Vote Buying and the Rise of Dark DAOs》(2018)，中金公司研究部*\n\n#### 体系外风险的解决方案\n\n以太坊创始人 Vitalik 就以上问题给出了三种潜在解决方案（具体解决方案也可以是多种方案的组合），主要围绕代币治理的问题。\\[12\\]\n\n* 施行有限的 Token 驱动的治理，对底层基础设施以 off-chain 投票机制为主；比如加时间戳来限制用户在获得 Token 后立刻加入治理环节、提高分叉的容易度等，但是这个办法本身比较消极；\n* 使用非纯 Token 投票驱动的治理形式，比如采用根据社区贡献度、人格证明系统来设计投票权，衍生出诸如二次方投票等形式；\n* 改变投票规则本身，Vitalik 认为代币投票之所以失败，是因为选民不单独对他们所投的决定负责，那么未来可以建立新投票系统——让选民必须对自己投票选择负责（建立负反馈机制，如果你的 Token 是贿赂来投票的，那么你的 Token 将被销毁）。\n\n基础设施的完善可能也能够带来新的解决方案。Vitalik 最近提出了 SBT——灵魂代币的概念，是和用户钱包（账户）绑定的不可转让的代币，任何线上线下的机构或个人都可以给一个钱包发放 SBT，例如用户的毕业学校、工作企业、参加过的公益组织、贷款或参与流动性挖矿的 DeFi 平台、深度参与过的 DAO 组织等。\\[13\\]SBT 有望集成用户单独身份和过往学历、职业等经历进而建立一套自下而上的个人信用评分体系，从而在 DAO 治理中实现甄别不同用户及其专业能力等作用，这将有望从完善基础设施角度上解决体系外风险的问题。\n\n## 总结：DAO 的发展仍然任重而道远\n\nDAO 的发展毫无疑问还处于早期，由于篇幅的关系，我们不太可能一一列举出 DAO 当下发展面临的种种问题和风险，但是就像科技的进步一样，用一种开放心态面对 DAO 的发展，实事求是，在发展中解决问题，或许是 DAO 未来正确发展之路。\n\n>

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第八篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体向上。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一个周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业发展\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658285205, "digest": "oGNbaYmpTOecjwcI5UgXp3z1czi6_x5CciDZlWTBeS8", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

{"id": "LfX7Bs8d7MoEJm2J7aPQnC49J6mvKYSvjJuX-k8LpMk", "title": "What Is Web3?", "body": "# What Is Web3?\n\n`Web3 is a new evolution of the Internet based around the principles of decentralization. Web3 combines the rich and interactive digital experiences that exist today with infrastructure that offers users ownership and cryptographic guarantees.` \n \n\nWeb3 has recently burst into the mainstream consciousness, with industry leaders across the traditional tech sector and blockchain ecosystem weighing in with a wide range of perspectives on the past and future of the Internet. \n  \n Before we dive in, a brief history of the term. \n  \n The term “Web 3.0” was first used during the dotcom era by HTTP pioneer Tim Berners-Lee to describe an integrated communication framework in which Internet data is machine-readable across different applications and systems—a concept he also referred to as the Semantic Web. \n  \n Later, in his 2014 blog post [DApps: What Web 3.0 Looks Like](http://gavwood.com/dappsweb3.html), Ethereum Co-founder Gavin Wood repurposed Berners-Lee’s expression, using it to refer to the ability of blockchain technology to define a “fundamentally different model for the interactions between parties” based on “a zero-trust interaction system.” \n  \n Wood’s writing focused not on cryptocurrencies but on protocols and technologies, such as consensus engines and cryptography, that could facilitate a stronger social contract across the web. He later described the aim of Web3 as “Less trust, more truth.” \n  \n Now, the term is the subject of much debate, with both the tech giants of today and the vanguard of the blockchain industry continuing to reckon with Web3’s core propositions and protocols, and its implications for the trust models of the future. \n  \n In this deep dive, we’ll define Web3 in relation to earlier iterations of the Internet, walk through the key technologies of the Web3 stack, and explore the current and future state of the Web3 landscape. \n  \n ‍**A note on terminology:** We’ll use the term “Web3” as distinct from “Web 3.0”, which is often associated with Berners-Lee’s vision of the Semantic Web. \n \n\n## The Evolution of the Internet: From Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 to Web3\n\nTo truly grasp the meaning of Web3, it’s important to understand the history of the Internet and how Web3 differs from the versions of the web that preceded it. \n \n\n### Web 1.0 (1994-2004)\n\nWeb 1.0 was the first iteration of the Internet we’re familiar with today, emerging in 1994 and ending around 2004 with the rise of social media giants like Twitter and Facebook. While the general public came to learn about the Web 1.0 Internet around 1994, Web 1.0 actually started as a U.S. government program called ARPANET, or Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, in 1968. ARPANET began as a small network of military contractors and university professors who exchanged data with one another. \n \n\n![ARPANET circa 1967. Each node in this diagram was either a computer at a university such as UC Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA, Michigan, Carnegie Mellon, or MIT. (source)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dq8hfK6hVBESyzGBjsWbJ.png?height=945&width=1088)\n\nThe Web 1.0 Internet was mostly a collection of static HTML pages and afforded users limited ability to interact with each other. Although Internet gateways such as America Online (AOL) and discussion forums such as Usenet permitted private chat and discussion boards, for most the Internet remained a space where few interactions or financial transactions took place. \n  \n \n\n![Web 1.0 pizza ordering form. Pizza Hut was an innovative company in the Web 1.0 space because it introduced a website that customers could use to order pizza. Payments, however, had to be made in person. (source)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZwMnxGlhDFI7jl5AXf_NO.png?height=300&width=450)\n\nWhere interactions and financial transactions did take place, they were limited in scope because there was a lack of secure infrastructure for transferring money. One of the most innovative Web 1.0 companies in this respect was Pizza Hut, which in 1995 created an order form for its customers that they could use to place an order and pay in cash once this order was delivered. \n \n\n![Early commercial for America Online (AOL), one of the first Internet gateways. AOL sent CDs with their software and 10 free hours of use to millions of people. (source)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RnQJc-Wmm-KOCBLGsrxUg.png?height=360&width=480)\n\n \n \n\nDespite America Online’s claim in a 1995 commercial that users could order flowers for their mom, buy tickets to a sports game, or write a research report on dinosaurs with AOL, exchanging money online required speaking with an operator since financial transactions were generally unsafe and had limited encryption. \n \n\n### Web 2.0 (2004-The Present)\n\nThe web evolved around 2004 as user demand for social interactions, music, video sharing, and financial transactions grew dramatically due to improved Internet speed, fiber optic infrastructure, and search engine improvements. \n \n\n![The MySpace page of Tom Anderson, co-founder of the early Web 2.0 company. Tom was your first contact when you signed up for a MySpace account. (source)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xI_Jlc5Nq3F6QC7i7LIpp.png?height=630&width=1200)\n\n \n \n\nThis demand for greater interactivity gave rise to many of today’s Internet institutions and companies. Social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter facilitated social interaction; data-sharing applications such as Napster met the demand for online music and video; Google provided an effective means for users to navigate the huge quantity of online information. Traditional institutions such as Bank of America met the demand for financial interactions and electronic fund transfers, enabled by new encryption standards such as 256-bit AES. \n  \n This new, more interactive Internet improved users’ experiences of the web tremendously by adding new functionality. But it also presented a tradeoff that continues to define our online lives to this day: To benefit from these new functionalities and interactions, users have to delegate a large quantity of information and responsibility to siloed third-party platforms, granting these centralized entities a considerable amount of power and influence in terms of data and content ownership. \n  \n This is, for the most part, how the Internet operates up until the present day. In the United States alone, Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon combined [received 23.56 billion visits](https://www.semrush.com/blog/most-visited-websites/) in October 2021—roughly double the traffic of websites ranked 5-20. \n \n\n### Web3 (2008-The Future)\n\nIn 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), which outlined the fundamentals of [blockchain technology](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-a-blockchain-and-how-can-it-impact-the-world/) and a peer-to-peer digital currency, setting a course to change the Web 2.0 paradigm. Bitcoin transformed how we think about digital transactions and provided the first secure means of exchanging money over the Internet that didn’t require a trusted third party. “What is needed,” Satoshi wrote, “is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.” \n  \n It was not until the invention of [smart contracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts) that a decentralized model of the Internet truly came into focus. If Bitcoin enabled secure peer-to-peer payments and smart contracts could expand this idea of programmable agreements to more advanced use cases—insurance, gaming, identity management, supply chains—how would the nature of web experience and digital interaction evolve? By enabling users to directly and securely transact with one another, smart contracts created a fresh vision for an Internet that is fair, transparent, and powered by cryptographic truth. \n  \n Gavin Wood described this reimagined web—Web3—as a “Secure Social Operating System.” \n  \n Put simply, Web3 is a decentralized vision of the Internet that aspires to create an entirely new system of contracts and change the way that individuals and institutions reach agreements. Web3 brings back the decentralized architecture of Web 1.0, the first version of the Internet, which was replete with user-hosted blogs and RSS feeds, and combines it with the rich, interactive experience of Web 2.0 web applications like social media platforms to provide a digital ecosystem where data is user-owned and transactions are backed by cryptographic guarantees. Rather than having to trust brand-based paper promises, users can rely on deterministic software logic to execute agreements exactly as programmed. \n \n\n![Interactions between content consumers and producers Web 1.0, 2.0, and Web3.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t223qh0ZA6x1RD510UPvS.png?height=752&width=1600)\n\n \n \n\n## The Core Elements of Web3: Blockchains, Cryptocurrency, Smart Contracts, and Oracles\n\nPowering the Web3 model is a growing stack of decentralized technologies, such as blockchains, smart contracts, [oracles](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles), crypto wallets, storage networks, and more. Below, we walk through some of the critical layers and componentry of the Web3 technology stack. \n \n\n### Blockchains\n\nA [blockchain](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-a-blockchain-and-how-can-it-impact-the-world/) is a highly secure and decentralized network that allows people to store data, exchange value, and record transaction activity in a shared ledger that is not controlled by any central authority. Blockchain networks serve as the backbone of Web3, providing secure execution environments that allow for the creation, distribution, and trading of cryptocurrencies, as well as the development of programmable smart contracts. Blockchains are the settlement layer of Web3. \n \n\n### Cryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrencies are digital tokens that leverage the decentralized and tamper-proof environments of blockchain networks to facilitate highly secure transactions. They are the native currencies of Web3 decentralized applications (dApps) and can also be used to pay for Web3 services and participate in Web3 governance. \n  \n Before blockchain technology, tokens were units of value that could be purchased and exchanged to pay for specific products and/or services, such as tokens for highway tolls or amusement park rides and games. In these earlier applications, tokens were useful to service providers because they allowed customers to pay upfront for services that they would consume in the future and because they facilitated transactions where exact change was required. \n  \n Tokens in Web3 applications are also units of value issued to Web3 content creators, but these units of value are digital, programmable, and have functions beyond exchange. In Web3, a token might be held as an investment in a protocol, project, or blockchain. It might have utility for that project or protocol—for paying for a service or insuring a service, for example. It might also provide a gateway to participation in the governance of the protocol or project. \n \n\n### Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (dApps)\n\n[Smart contracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts) are tamper-proof programs on blockchains that facilitate automatic transactions by using conditional software logic such as, “*if x is true, then execute y*.” Programmable smart contracts enable the creation of decentralized applications, or dApps, the cryptoeconomic protocols that bring Web3 to life and put it in the hands of users. \n  \n dApps are different from the applications (apps) that we are familiar with in the Web 2.0 world and the static HTML pages from the Web 1.0 world because they are not maintained by any single individual or organization but rather powered by the decentralized infrastructure of blockchain networks. These seemingly simple, decentralized programs can be used to create complex, automated systems such as [peer-to-peer financial services (DeFi)](https://chain.link/education/defi), [data-driven insurance products](https://chain.link/use-cases/insurance), [play-to-earn online games](https://chain.link/use-cases/nfts-and-blockchain-games), and more. \n \n\n### Oracles\n\nTo realize their full potential, smart contracts need to access and interact with data and systems outside of blockchain networks. [Oracles](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles) are the entities that connect blockchains to real-world data and existing systems, and provide critical infrastructure for establishing a unified, interoperable Web3 ecosystem. \n  \n Chainlink oracle networks not only feed financial market data on-chain to power DeFi applications, but they also provide a wide range of secure off-chain computations such as [verifiable randomness](https://chain.link/chainlink-vrf) and [decentralized execution](https://blog.chain.link/smart-contract-automation/) to enable dynamic NFTs and highly automated dApps. Moreover, with the development of the [Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)](https://blog.chain.link/introducing-the-cross-chain-interoperability-protocol-ccip/), oracle networks will help enable the fast-growing ecosystem of different blockchains and layer-2 scaling solutions to securely communicate with one another. \n  \n Oracles have emerged as an expansive layer of the Web3 stack, providing off-chain data and services to facilitate smart contract innovation, and cross-chain interoperability to help ensure seamless connectivity between different on-chain environments. Chainlink’s oracle infrastructure is also the gateway to Web3 for Web 2.0 backends, serving as an abstraction layer for traditional systems to interact with any private or public blockchain. Ultimately, oracles are the infrastructure that extends the power of decentralized computation and cryptographic guarantees to existing systems, bridging Web 2.0 and Web3. \n \n\n \n \n\n![Web3 is built with decentralized computing networks.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pf2xXNtVs9zPFN7sfzMIq.png?height=1600&width=1529)\n\nThe renewed interest in NFTs has led to a Cambrian explosion of unique applications that leverage the property of non-fungibility in innovative ways, often with the goal of increasing efficiency in the transfer of asset ownership and reducing the need for intermediaries who siphon value away from creators and marketplaces. However, NFTs are still largely in their infancy, meaning there is a vast amount of opportunity for growth from innovative developers, creative artists, and traditional institutions wanting to bring distinct assets on-chain. \n \n\n## Web3 Applications\n\nWeb3 combines decentralization and interactivity to create a new model for the Internet where users can interact directly, without intermediaries. dApps allow users to access permissionless financial tools, trade cryptocurrencies in a peer-to-peer manner, receive parametric insurance payouts, buy and sell verifiably owned digital art through NFTs, play value-generating games, and a whole host of other activities—all without the intervention of a central arbiter. \n  \n With this new structure, the proponents of Web3 hope to create a fairer, more open version of the Internet where parties can interact and transact directly. Currently, Web3 applications that leverage the three foundational technologies—blockchains, smart contracts, and decentralized oracle networks—are already unlocking [use cases](https://blog.chain.link/smart-contract-use-cases/) that are redefining sectors as diverse as [real estate](https://blog.chain.link/blockchain-technology-real-estate/), education, [finance](https://chain.link/education/defi), gaming, and healthcare, and are set to have a transformational impact well beyond these domains. \n \n\nThe technologies that comprise Web3 enable individuals to create and participate in financial protocols that offer unprecedented access, security, and transparency—a new economic landscape that is now widely known as [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://chain.link/education/defi). \n  \n Unlike traditional financial services, DeFi protocols leverage the decentralized infrastructure of blockchains and the secure inputs of oracle networks to help users directly transact with one another in transparent and tamper-proof on-chain markets. [Decentralized money markets](https://blog.chain.link/decentralized-money-markets/) such as Aave—which now secures over $12B in smart contract value using Chainlink oracles—operate in a non-custodial manner and enable users to lend and borrow funds peer-to-peer. Money markets are a key mechanism for supporting a healthy economy. By decentralizing control and leveraging predefined smart contract logic, on-chain money markets help increase economic access, reduce single points of failure, and mitigate system risk and fractional reserve practices.   \n  \n One great DeFi innovation is its [composable architecture](https://blog.chain.link/defis-permissionless-composability-is-supercharging-innovation/), which empowers developers to combine open-source protocols into more sophisticated financial instruments, such as no-loss savings games that use overcollateralized loan protocols, decentralized stablecoins, and interest-bearing tokens that put idle capital to work and unlock liquidity. \n  \n While the novel financial applications offered by DeFi are currently one of the most prominent aspects of Web3, the Web3 model extends far beyond financial transactions, encompassing every area of the Internet, from entertainment and social media to browser software. \n \n\n### NFTs, Gaming, and the Metaverse\n\n[NFTs](https://chain.link/education/nfts), blockchain gaming, and the [metaverse](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-the-metaverse/) are currently emerging as key pillars of the Web3 ecosystem. NFTs offer verifiable ownership of digital assets, allowing digital goods to have a functional level of uniqueness similar to that of items in the real world. With NFTs, one digital item can now be differentiated from another even if they present the same way, similar to how two copies of the same book can be differentiated through their unique markings and evidence of specific wear-and-tear. \n  \n This has massive implications for digital art, metaverse applications, and video games. Currently, NFT projects such as [Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) are popularizing NFTs and digital art, and blockchain games such as [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) are spearheading a paradigm shift in player economics in gaming. Underpinning this foundational transformation are blockchains, which operate as the underlying settlement layer, NFT smart contracts, which enable verifiable ownership of digital items, and decentralized oracles, which provide key services such as [verifiable randomness](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/), [smart contract automation](http://keepers.chain.link/), off-chain data, and more. \n \n\n### Parametric Insurance\n\nOne exciting use case emerging within the blockchain industry is decentralized [parametric insurance](https://blog.chain.link/blockchain-insurance/). Blockchain insurance projects such as [Arbol](https://www.arbolmarket.com/) and [Etherisc](https://etherisc.com/) are currently implementing novel implementations of frictionless and automated crop insurance, flight insurance, and more through a combination of smart contracts and off-chain data inputs facilitated by Chainlink Data Feeds. Let’s walk through a quick example. \n  \n Imagine a farmer requires more than 20 inches of rain in a season for an adequate crop harvest. The farmer wants to hedge against the risk of a bad harvest through insurance. Normally, he would have to go through a lengthy process to receive funds and need to rely on a centralized insurance provider to verify the amount of rainfall. \n  \n However, in Web3, anyone in the world can permissionlessly take on a policy with just an Internet connection. With the blockchain-based crop insurance provided by Arbol, the insurance cost and payout terms are automatically determined based on pre-defined parameters, and payment is automated through an insurance smart contract based on weather data provided Chainlink. The insurance process becomes quick and painless, with a simple binary that determines whether the farmer receives insurance funds. Did an IoT sensor record less than 20 inches of rain that season? If yes, pay the farmer immediately. If no, don’t pay the farmer. \n  \n This model has the ability to be expanded to areas such as [shipping](https://blog.chain.link/build-a-marine-insurance-smart-contract-with-chainlink/) and fire insurance, with blockchain-based parametric flight insurance already in operation. \n  \n \n\n## What’s Next for Web3\n\nIn his recent [Future of Chainlink presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YShbzR7mlog), Chainlink Co-founder Sergey Nazarov explained the emerging megatrends of the Web3 ecosystem that have recently pierced the mainstream: “What you really see with the implementation of cryptographic guarantees in the Web3 world is a very specific set of applications, and some of these applications are called DeFi, some of them are called NFTs, some of them are called tokenized ownership, but these are the very early examples of cryptographic guarantees making their way into people’s and industries’ daily operations.” \n \n\n![As people realize the power of cryptographic guarantees, they’ll move from centralized, probabilistic service providers to the trust-minimized services of Web3.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-A2JyPMbt4YwwJLdiYEP6.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n \n \n\nWeb3—a term that has become shorthand for a reimagined Internet experience powered by decentralized technologies—is already transforming how we interact online, from how we invest and exchange to how we play and express ourselves artistically. More and more users and institutions across the globe are waking up to the power of zero-trust interactions and cryptographically-backed agreements. While Web3 is still in its early stages, it has the potential to realize the ideals of hardwired transparency, reliability, and expediency the Internet was built to fulfill. “At the end of the day,” Nazarov noted, “as Web3 approaches the speed, the efficiency, and the low cost of web systems, it has a guarantee that no Web 2.0 system can ever have, which is the trust minimization cryptographic guarantee.”", "timestamp": 1658285826, "digest": "-5catWrSKnD26BzhPxyfRXUeUpCnHQWeQZU0XZT0UQs", "contributor": "0xe31e1beE0b954e20E39F049532fF403b2997b307"}

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第八篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一个周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658285829, "digest": "3iZyHuEbcoS9jkCN1JJgiXZEWSaX-CyYqW-PgIkeiwY", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

网络锁仓的加密资产总额（TVL）已超过 1.4 亿美元，7 日内增幅为 38%。zkSync 是基于 ZK Rollup 扩容方案实现的以太坊 Layer2 网络，目前，它的 TVL 增幅在众多 Layer2 网络中排名第一，这说明越来越多资金和用户正在体验 zkSync 网络及其应用。\n\n以太坊主网在正式升级为 2.0 之前，解决链上拥堵的方式之一是构建一个可以在链外执行大部分活动的 2 层网络（Layer2），以缓解对主网的计算及存储压力，增加以太坊的可扩展性。\n\n在各种构件 Layer2 网络的技术中，Rollup 逐渐被认为是最优解，因为它能将智能合约的实际计算和存储在链下完成，并将交易数据通过一系列压缩技巧批量提交并保存在以太坊主网上，无需单一数据一一验证。如此一来，layer2 网络的安全性不但能由以太坊主网保障，且不破坏网络的去中心化，还能增加网络的可扩展性和效率。更重要的是，Rollup 可以让以太坊主网的应用程序便捷地迁移至 Layer2。\n\n利用 Rollup 技术实现 Layer2 网络的构建，又因密码学的验证算法不同而形成了多种路径，Optimistic Rollup、ZK Rollup、Arbitrum Rollup 成为主流方案。目前，应用各种方案的 Layer2 网络均有所建树，各个流派分别在研发和实践中发展。\n\n其中，ZK Rollup 是利用「零知识证明」验证方式来落实 Rollup 的扩容方案，被以太坊创始人 Vitalik Buterin 视作 Layer2 的终极之选。\n\nzkSync 网络近期的 TVL 激增进一步验证了 x 的可行性，尤其是今年 2 月 zkSync 上线了 2.0 版本的公共测试网络以来，支撑它的 ZK Rollup 扩容技术方案也越来越受区块链技术社区关注。\n\n那么，ZK Rollup 扩容方案究竟是什么？与 Optimistic Rollup、Arbitrum Rollup 有何区别？除了 zkSync2.0，还有哪些网络使用了 ZK Rollup 技术？本期 DeFi 蜂窝将一一解答。\n\n### 简介\n\nZK Rollup 是基于「零知识证明」验证方式落实 Rollup 技术的 layer2 解决方案，「ZK」正是「Zero Knowledge」（零知识）的字母简称，该方案起源于 2018 年下半年，最早由区块链技术研究员 Barry Whitehat 提出。\n\n保留了 Rollup 技术的原理，ZK Rollup 可以在链下完成复杂计算，生成证明，传输回主网进行证明校验，并存储部分数据来保证数据可用性，且共享主网的安全性。\n\nZK Rollup 的特点正是那个「ZK」部分，「零知识证明」算法能让证明者在不向验证者提供任何有用信息的情况下，使验证者相信某个结果的正确性。\n\n举个例子，A 要向 B 证明自己拥有某个房间的钥匙，假设该房间只能用钥匙开锁，而其他任何方法都打不开。这时有 2 个方法：要么，A 把钥匙出示给 B，B 用这把钥匙打开房间的锁，从而证明 A 拥有该房间的正确钥匙；或者 B 确定该房间内有某一物体，A 用自己拥有的钥匙打开房门，然后把物体拿出来出示给 B，从而证明自己确实拥有该房间的钥匙。\n\n后面的方法就类似于零知识证明。它的优点在于，在整个证明的过程中，B 始终不能看到钥匙的样子，从而避免了钥匙的泄露。\n\n「零知识证明」对于强调隐私性的区块链来说是重要的技术手段，比特币网络就是应用之一。除了隐私性，技术研究人员也开始将其应用在提升区块链的性能方面，ZK Rollup 就是其一，它主张，若某个区块需要大量数据验证才能完成打包、开启下一个区块，不妨由一人验证并生成证明，而其他人来验证这个证明无误即可，这样就避免了每个人都要花很长时间来验证一个证明，从而提高数据验证的效率。\n\n在 ZK Rollup 方案下，Layer2 网络上的多个交易数据打包之后，会创建一个链下计算的「零知识证明」结果，主网（Layer1）验证者可以快速检查此证明是否正确。而且，正因为 Layer2 到 Layer1 的交易数据能即时验证，因此，它也能实现 Layer2 资产转移到 Layer1 时可以即时结算。\n\n### ZK Rollup 与其他 Rollup 方案的区别\n\nZK Rollup 是利用 Rollup 技术构建以太坊 Layer2 网络的一种实现方式，另一个主要是 Optimistic Rollup，二者的区别主要在于使用的验证算法不同。\n\nOptimistic Rollup 使用了「欺诈证明」验证算法，它的前提是验证者要在 Layer2 网络上质押一定数量 ETH「押金」，作为「不撒谎」的背书，如此前提下，它假设 Layer2 网络的交易均有效，提交到 layer1 (以太坊主网) 的数据都正确，如果有人对任何一笔交易提出异议，这个时候，数据才需要在以太坊主网上进行一一验证，哪个验证者提交的数据有问题，就会被网络判定为欺诈，那么这个验证人的押金被没收。\n\n在这样的验证算法原理下，当 Layer2 上汇总的每批交易提交到 Layer1 时，会有一个 7 天的异议提交周期。这也造成用户从 Optimistic Rollup 方案下的网络中提取或退出加密资产时，增加了一个 7 天的等待期。\n\n这不但造成了 Optimistic Rollup 相关网络的体验不友好，更麻烦的是，一旦出现异议数据，所有交易数据都要在主网上重新验证，反而增加了主网负担。\n\n于是，针对这个痛点，Arbitrum Rollup 在 Optimistic Rollup 上进行了改善，它主张把异议部分先进行划块处理，找出争议最大的部分，以太坊主网只对争议部分进行验证，以此缓解主网的验证负担。\n\n除此之外，Arbitrum Rollup 的进步还在于实现了与 EVM 的兼容，这就使得应用该技术的 layer2 网络可以承载以太坊主网上的应用无缝迁移，于是，不少 DeFi 应用选择部署「Arbitrum 版」。相较之下，Optimistic Rollup 扩容方案还没有做到 100% 兼容 EVM。\n\n可见，Arbitrum Rollup 方案算是 Optimistic Rollup 的「改进版」。尽管如此，资金从 Arbitrum Rollup 相关网络的退出时还是需要一个等待期，这个痛点还有待改善。\n\n而在与 EVM 的兼容方面，ZK Rollup 也此前一直难有突破。以太坊创始人 Vitalik Buterin（花名 V 神）曾在公开演讲中表示，ZK Rollup 由于底层技术较为复杂，想要做到完全兼容以太坊虚拟机可能需要几年时间，短期内，Optimistic Rollup 是以太坊扩容方案的可行之选，但长期而言会更倾向于 ZK Rollup。\n\nV 神这么一点评，ZK Rollup 被认为是以太坊扩容方案的「圣杯」。\n\n令人意外的是，ZK Rollup 兼容 EVM 的开发进度比预期快了许多。今年 2 月份，使用 ZK Rollup 方案的 zkSync 2.0 公测网上线，它兼容了 EVM。这意味着，在不久的将来，ZK Rollup 方案不再被束之高阁，基于它的网络将迎来应用的迁移。\n\n目前，ZK Rollup 方案的 Layer2 落地的主要选手是 StarkWare 和 zkSync。\n\n## zkSync 不断升级完成 EVM 兼容\n\n2019 年，MatterLabs 团队开始利用 ZK Rollup 扩容方案开发 zkSync 网络。2020 年 6 月，zkSync1.0 版本上线，主要聚焦于支付。作为 Layer2 扩容层，zkSync1.0 链上的转账手续费用极低，处理交易快速，且手续费不仅限于 ETH，利用该网络转账的其他以太坊标准资产也能用作手续费，资产进出以太坊主网一般在几分钟到几小时不等。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202203/5-1648172040274.png)\n\n*zkSync 官网*\n\n目前，用户可以通过授权以太坊钱包激活 zkSync 网络账户，ETH、ERC-20 标准下的 USDT 等资产可自由进出该网络，资产可与其他 zkSync 账户进行转移。\n\nzkSync1.0 由于不兼容 EVM，网络的可用性受到限制，能支持的应用场景非常有限，但由于转账费用低，到账即时，zkSync1.0 最主要的应用方向还是支付。\n\n今年 2 月，zkSync 2.0 版本的公共测试网上线，实现了 EVM 兼容，也因此成为首个利用 ZK Rollup 方案并兼容 EVM 的区块链网络。\n\nzkSync2.0 支持开发人员使用以太坊原生编程语言 Solidity 在网络上部署去中心化应用程序，以太坊主网上现有的 DeFi 应用也可以集成至 zkSync2.0 网络上，开发者和用户都低费用、高效率地使用这个 Layer2 网络。\n\n### 应用代表\n\n**去中心化交易应用（DEX）ZigZag**\n\nZigZag 没有采纳 DEX 常用的自动做市商（AMM）机制，而是采用去中心化订单簿模型，这正是 ZK Rollup 技术底层天然的「汇总性」带来的便利，它允许交易者以最小的滑点和高流动性订单进行现货交易，试图成为中心化交易所（CEX）在链上的替代方案。\n\n**Layer2 跨链桥 Orbiter Finance**\n\nOrbiter Finance 是为 Layer2 网络搭建的跨链桥，它支持 zkSync、Arbitrum、Optimism 等 Layer2 网络间的资产跨链转移，也支持 Layer2 和 Layer1 之间的资产互转。\n\n## StarkWare 系统化创建 Layer2\n\nStarkWare 可以视作一个公司，它创建于 2018 年，有一套完整的 Layer2 系统解决方案，特别是它在「零知识证明」基础上创新出 zkSTARK 算法，用以进一步增强网络的扩展性，并将这一算法进行了产品化，形成了 StarkNet（Layer2 扩容网络）和 StarkEx（扩容技术）两个落地模块。\n\n![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202203/5-1648172094352.png)\n\n**StarkNet**\n\n它是搭建在以太坊上的 Layer2 网络，测试网已经于 2021 年 11 月上线，支持开发者进行应用部署，用户可以将交易发送到网络上，所有交易将定期进行批量处理，生成 STARK 证明，然后在以太坊主网验证这些证明。由于验证所需的计算内容很少，从而提升了链上的处理效率。\n\n由于 StarkNet 还未兼容 EVM，因此，它一直没有获得以太坊头部 DeFi 应用的迁移。目前，该 Layer2 上主要应用为去中心化交易应用（DEX）Myswap 和一站式交易应用 JediSwap\n\n**StarkEx**\n\n它是一套可扩容引擎技术，专门为以太坊应用提供扩容方案和程序服务，已经用于不少知名去中心化应用，包括去中心化永续合约交易应用 dYdX、去中心化交易应用 DeversiFi、NFT 生态系统 Immutable X。\n\n作为期货交易平台，dYdX（DYDX）需要高速结算， StarkEx 帮助它大大提高了结算速度，增强了用户体验。\n\nDeversiFi 是首个采用 StarkEx 扩容引擎的 DEX，它使用的是订单簿模式，实现方式是链下处理交易、链上完成结算。以往，链上结算的方式对链的性能要求较高，Layer1 类型的网络对此存在制约。现在，StarkEx 引擎解决了这一点，它为非托管式交易提供了即时结算、高流动性、低滑点等保障。此外，DeversiFi 使用了 zkSTARK 算法的隐私层，很好地保证了用户的交易隐私。\n\nImmutable X 是以太坊针对 NFT 资产设置的 Layer2 扩容方案，它基于 StarkEx 引擎搭建，该网络上的资产及交易数据均由以太坊保障，用户无需担心安全问题。更重要的是，StarkEx 支持提取资产到以太坊链上即时到账，没有 7 天的间隔期。目前，卡牌游戏 Gods Unchained（GODS）、战斗类角色扮演游戏 Illuvium (ILV) 等已选择与 Immutable X 集成，为用户提供快速的、0 Gas 费的交易体验。", "timestamp": 1658285357, "digest": "lHVJKCk9aTbhWCKKc81EwgUqjJZ-yejOTcV26jzXs80", "contributor":

Because in the past, they flew in the sky and rarely looked down. Therefore, for a long time, Although he passed by here, he didn't know that there were so many interesting people and interesting things in such a vast land. In this new place, he met many new friends, the chattering mole and the boasting hare. , Porcupines who are not good at speech, they quickly became close \"comrades-in-arms\". The happiest time for them is when night falls, outside the porcupine's residence, looking at the stars and talking about the distance, although the geese have been to many places, But in every place, he only knew a little bit, and he didn't know more details. One day, the porcupine said, Dayan, I have a friend who has admired you for a long time and wanted to get to know you, but he is not very convenient to move. Can I go see him sometime?

Dandelion, Dandelion said to Dayan, Sister Dayan, I have a dream since I was a child. I want to be like my ancestors, to fly to the farthest place that I think I can reach. Can you tell me what the distance is like? Is it beautiful from afar? Dayan was at a loss for words, he didn't know how to start, he didn't know what this idiot-like question was referring to, in order to save face, Dayan began to talk about it, there are wonderful waterfronts, and there is an inexhaustible supply of them. , there is... After a nonsense, the mole fell asleep, the hare knitted the sweater in his hand, and only the porcupine was still listening to the geese's boast. On the way back, the porcupine said to Dayan: \"Dayan, you and I have met once, and I want to ask you something, okay?\" Dayan said, \"Go ahead! I know that one day, you will leave here. , you will fly to your destination, I just want you to make some space for the dandelion, okay?

On that day, moles, porcupines, and hares will all come to see them off. The geese are ready to take off with their blessings, entrustment, and nostalgia. The air blew on the dandelion, the wild goose took off, the porcupine, the mole, and the hare ran with him for a long time, until they turned into a small black spot in the distance, and flew for a long time, the dandelion looked at a valley in the distance, and the wild goose Said: \"Goose, my distant place is not the fertile fertile field you mentioned. My ancestors told us that the distant place of dandelion is a barren valley. Our dream is to wait for one day to fill the valley with bright yellow flowers in spring.

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第八篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并持续推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一次周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n原文：\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n编译：\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658285969, "digest": "B7sXp44pe6A0Emj8ZlEHBM3M5ahKifjInjXGqbluO_Q", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第八篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并持续推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一次周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n原文：\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n编译：\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658286041, "digest": "pNWEv5f2BlVx-CTwx53kQnhIv7WjaDcRO0_cnZJ7YXk", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS 的起步阶段跟上了 ETH 迅速发展的顺风车，迅速成为 ETH 生态的重要一环，后续的巨额空投也充分体现了一次共享的 Web3 精神，回顾过往的 ENS 可以作为非常典型的成功案例。然而现状却更多的是站在此前的光环之下裹足不前：首要的因素是团队耕耘数年进入收获期，需要足够的时间再寻动力；其次，产品本身集中于域名服务，产品的成熟度瓶颈到来相对早。个人认为在下一个周期的 ENS 重点关注产品力本身是否有新的迸发，提升自身作为 Web3 可选部分的吸引力。或者更大胆一些成为 Web3 世界无可替代的组成部分，完成共识层面的跃迁（当然这是极难的），由此站在交易市场的角度， $ENS 作为投机品种的上限肯定会惊掉大部分人的下巴。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n### 第八篇20220720\n\n【输出人】@Guyue\n\n【主题】灰度：九张图纵观加密市场周期规律\n\n【核心内容简介】\n\n加密市场周期每次平均持续约为 4 年。从定性的角度来看，每个周期都标志着产品和采用方面的进步，为下一个周期提供了跳板：\n\n2012 - 2015 年：黑客时代+以太坊起步；\n\n2016 年 - 2019 年：ICO 实验时代 & DeFi 诞生；\n\n2020 年 - 目前：杠杆、机构和 DeFi 压力测试。\n\n新兴资产类别有着极为剧烈的价格波动，但区块链技术将彻底改变数字生活的方方面面，进而推动行业的整体进步。目前已有帮助发展中国家提供普惠金融和公平性、激发金融和密码学方面的创新，并持续推动着互联网进入去中心化的新阶段。\n\n加密货币市场此前经历的每一个周期都让这个生态系统更加强大。前三次市场周期已经为我们提供了经过“压力测试”的 DeFi 、基础设施协议、规模化解决方案的创新和不断增长的元宇宙行业。尽管目前处于价格下跌、清算和波动的阶段，但伴随加密行业持续的建设和创新，相信将不断推进行业的发展。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n回顾加密货币市场的前三次周期，让我们看到了行业波折反复但整体向上的发展道路，下一次周期会与之前有哪些相同与不同也很值得时间的验证。行业内人员最重要的是认可区块链行业的未来发展、乐观面对一切潜在的困难，参与建设、留下印记，静待在下一次周期中的花开。\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bear-Markets-in-Perspective-FINAL-Designed.pdf)\n\n[https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328](https://www.odaily.news/post/5180328)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658285839, "digest": "wJas-cLLVaTUlab8AEnGY_aQFPKRoEec-nYr1iPo0no", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

You will hear a \"beep\" sound, and in this \"beep\" sound, of course, there are eggs, but at the same time, there is the head that touched head-on.\n​​\nSome people have calculated that an egg weighing 30 grams will cause a swollen head if it falls from the 4th floor, the scalp will be damaged if it falls from the 8th floor, and the skull will be broken if it falls from the 18th floor. Falling from the 25th floor can cause death on the spot.\n​​\nA fragile egg becomes extremely powerful when it has a certain height and speed.\n​​\nSo, don't underestimate an egg, and as an egg, don't underestimate yourself. A weak egg, with the corresponding conditions, can make a hard rock tremble with fear.\n​​\nSecond, the professor said that there are two ways to break an egg.

When you are still an egg, why do you want to hit the stone hard?\n​​\nYou know your fragility, you know you can't beat a hard rock, but why do you still touch it?

Tap the top of the egg lightly to break it, allowing the egg to stand up. But the egg that stands up like this is at the cost of maiming and destroying an egg. Cruel damage can make an egg stand up.\n​​\nHow to make an egg stand up? Make a mold and put the eggs in the mold so the eggs can stand up. Moderate restraint allows the egg to stand up.\n​​\nHow to make an egg stand up? Make a stand and place the egg on the stand so the egg will stand up. External support allows the egg to stand up.\n​​\nLetting an egg stand up is like letting a person's life stand up. What method do you choose to make your life stand up?\n​​\n5\\. Once, a friend put an egg in my palm and asked me to hold it hard to see if I could hold the broken egg. But no matter how hard I try, I can't hold the egg in my hand.\n​​\nUsually, an egg can be broken with a single tap. Why is it that an egg in the palm of your hand cannot be broken even if you try your best to hold it?\n​​\nA friend said that we usually knock an egg and focus the target on a point of the egg. It seems that the force used is small, but when the target is concentrated, the force acting on the egg is also larger; Covering the whole egg, our grip strength is spread over the entire surface of the egg. It seems that the force used is large, but once the force is dispersed, the force acting on the egg is also smaller.

Investor）、MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）。以下是直播内容摘录：**\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n欢迎大家来参加今天的推特 Space，今天非常有幸请到 Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）作为分享嘉宾，先有请他做一下自我介绍。\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\nHello 大家好，我是 Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人，今天非常高兴有机会聊聊关于艺术 NFT 的演变之路的想法，欢迎大家一块参与讨论。\n\n**MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）**\n\n我们今天也是同时邀请到 Theirsverse 的 Co-founder Hyphen，首先我个人也是非常喜欢 Theirsverse 的理念，强调“跨过分歧、拥抱不同”的核心概念，引起了 Z 世代的强烈共鸣，也可以说是真正将社会议题融入到 NFT 艺术品的理念中。同时恭喜 Theirsverse 经过一年的筹备，在昨天白名单 Mint 阶段全部售罄，那么先请 Hyphen 简单介绍一下自己。\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Theirsverse）**\n\nhello 大家好，我是 Theirsverse 的创始人和艺术总监，很高兴今天有机会跟大家介绍 Theirsverse 的发起和理念，也很期待跟大家一起聊天。\n\n@**guooooog**\n\n大家好，我是毕业于中央美院实验艺术学院，现在主要从事生成艺术方面的创作。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n今天的话我们都知道， James Jeans NFT Holder 可以在 Outland 线上兑换实体版画，谁有资格获得？非 holder 或者其他人有无可能/怎样参与其中？\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\nOutland 今天正式上线了 James Jeans NFT 项目，大家可以凭借自己的积分去兑换一张对应到自己 NFT 编号的实体版画，这个版画有专属钢印和 James Jeans 签名。\n\n我们推出这样的实体版画原因有两个，第一是想通过新的玩法，也就是积分和 Merch 之间的配合，让大家了解其实 NFT 可以跟线下产生联动、产生赋能。这种积分机制和之前出现过的 实体作品以及 NFT 销毁不太一样，比如说达米安·赫斯特先生推出的方式。同时这也是我们预期的可以去激励到 NFT 流动性的一种方式。\n\n第二点其实这是 James Jeans 自己的想法，他看到大家的热情，对于第二个章节的期待，就希望能够给大家更多福利和关怀，让大家可以亲手触碰到艺术，让艺术品进入到大家的生活空间当中。\n\n基于这两个原因，Outland 在现在这个时间点推出 Merch 平台，也算是回馈社区的小小努力。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n对于 NFT 一直以来最大的争议就是，买 NFT 就是买 JPEG 甚至是买空气，那么像这次兑换实体版画的活动算是给了相关言论一个有力的还击。Outland是如何与世界范围内头部的艺术家共同构平台愿景的？近期有什么样的计划和大家分享？\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\n之前并没有像 web3 区块链这样的技术以及社区，能够帮助艺术家第一时间和对自己作品感兴趣、喜爱自己创作的朋友达成一个连接。比如说像方力钧老师、James Jeans 以及我们未来要推出的艺术家，他们最开始了解到 web3 和区块链的时候，更多的印象这就是一个技术，但实际上当这个技术落地到社区建设、作品研发和平台发行的过程当中去的话，就发现是非常有血有肉有细节的。\n\n我们发现很多艺术家非常有意愿能够多做一些什么，能够和喜爱自己作品的朋友达成一种连接。在这样一个背景之下，我们觉得并不一定非要区别所谓的 NFT 和线下艺术品之间的明确界限，我们相信当不同的产业和领域都落地到 web3 当中的时候，线下和线上联动会更加紧密。\n\n在这样一个愿景之下，艺术家和 Outland 平台一起做了个未来规划，也就是说之后所有上线的作品肯定在某些方面有前瞻性或者创新性的，我们希望 Outland 能够将原来在殿堂之内的艺术带到大家生活当中去的一个中间桥梁这么一个平台。\n\n**MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）**\n\n我想问一下 Hyphen，你在纽约的所⻅所闻是否对你的艺术创作产⽣了影响，你在这个年纪为什么会思考平等並且关注不同肤色人种的权利？那么Theirs NFT 在后期会有什么赋能呢?\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Theirsverse）**\n\n我是大概两年前去纽约，我从小在台北长大，接受的是美国教育体制。所以并不是到纽约才有这种感觉，从小我就能够感受到文化冲突，在学校的时候可能会觉得自己像一个美国人，虽然我不觉得自己是美国人，但表现得比较美式，回到家聊天又会比较传统一点。\n\n所以小时候成长过程我就不太有归属感，跟我们这边称之为“很台”的那些人没办法打上真正的交道，但是跟老外也没办法完全融入，我一直到现在都是跟国际学校的人比较好。这种没有归属感到纽约之后更加凸显，小时候以为只有我这样，到了纽约之后发现大家都这样，因为纽约很少土生土长的人，我认识的都是从不同世界不同地方来的人。\n\n我觉得很重要的一部分是，世界越来越国际化，每个国家都是。过了二十三十年，我不会很意外每个国家都充满不同的人群。那我觉得从现在就要开始为这种国际化的到来做准备。因为从小我长大的地方都是亚洲人，到国外有很多文化差异，不止是要去尊重，还要去学习。如果你不去学习的话，不会知道要如何待遇别人，这种世界观是蛮重要的。\n\n在纽约身为少数民族的亚洲人或者黑人、或者无性别主义者，或者 LGBT 人群，这些不是主流群组的人，我觉得我们看了美国的历史，才发现抗争了那么久猜到了这个（平等）的地步。当世界慢慢国际化，网络让世界被拉拢起来，我们需要知道的一件事情是，不能在重复这种错误，重复有哪一种族群比另外一个族群强大的观念，而不只是扣上说说而已。\n\n但是现在的种族歧视可能更隐晦，比如我到了美国，可能跟我国内朋友说中文的时候，有一个白人就跟我说，你说韩文的声音真好听。其实我想说我已经跟你说过几百遍，我是在讲中文，这两种语言在我们听起来是天差地别的。\n\n虽然他们不是恶意，我觉得身为亚洲人，我们对黑人和白人也会有各种偏见，那么要去除这些标签，包括肤色、性向、性别、贫富差距、年纪差异，不是我们看不到差别，反而要去欣赏，更加升华他们的文化，这是 Theirsverse 很重要的一个人物。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n如何看待NFT对艺术行业的影响，web3对当代艺术家的创作到底是冲击还是帮助？所谓的传统艺术家和NFT原生艺术家是否有本质上的不同？艺术家该如何加入到NFT的世界中来？\n\n@**guooooog**\n\n原生加密艺术家跟传统当代艺术家还是有很大区别。\n\n首先是原生加密艺术家熟悉整个加密赛道的玩法跟规则，甚至很多加密艺术家是程序员，非常熟悉计算机美学、代码美学和匿名性。刚才 Hyphen 提到种族平等的问题，web3 等于把所有人拉平了，我其实更喜欢匿名艺术家，而不是实名艺术家。\n\n因为实名之后，艺术家的身份和背景资料都会被看到，当然现在还是 web2.5 阶段，信任机制还没有那么完善，匿名性是 web3 很重要的一个属性，不管你是什么背景、什么资历，只要作品好、表达的内容非常有意思，提供给行业的东西有创新性，大家就是认可的。\n\n所以说这是非常好的一件事，也是 web3 最有意思的一个部分，因为传统当代艺术圈有很多问题，比如权利集中化，由策展人、美术馆这种机构、评论家、画廊、拍卖行整个体系形成了一个标准，如果这种标准一直持续下去，是会形成非常垄断和精英化的局面。\n\n当然现在包括 Artblocks 在内也是这种有点传统的方式去输出作品，也有一些平台不是这种玩法，我觉得未来会越来越少，因为现在是 web2.5 还没有完全去除这些东西。\n\n不管是当代艺术家还是加密艺术家，代码、程序和区块链技术，底层逻辑都是一种媒介跟语言，他们都可以基于这种语言去创作一些很好的作品。但是对 web3 不太熟悉的当代艺术家来说相对还是有一些困难的。就像文艺复兴时期透视学的出现、油画语言的出现、包括能够随身携带颜料去快速画一些户外风景，这些其实都是技术带来的革命，本质就是一种语言。\n\n当代艺术家在传统语言体系已经把握了这种玩法，语言熟练程度非常高，但是加密艺术是一套新的体系和新的语言，当代艺术家需要熟悉这种语言才能创作出很好的作品。对于加密艺术家来说，也要熟悉一些当代艺术和传统艺术圈的玩法跟体系，才能创作出更好的作品。\n\n当然很多传统艺术圈的人进入到加密艺术之后会被啪啪打脸，是因为加密艺术圈的很多玩法和体系跟传统是不一样的。从某种程度上说，其实 NFT 是一种革新和范式，它需要去迎合原来当代艺术的标准吗，我认为完全不需要。这两个领域可能是相互融合相互促进的并行状态，它们并不打架。\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\n在最开始我们去接触艺术家的过程中，发现尤其是一些年龄比较大的艺术家，对于整个区块链和 NFT 技术可能没有一个明确的概念。但是，以我从策划阶段跟方力钧老师接触为例，当代艺术家有一个优势，就是天然骨子里去反叛、去革新、去突破系统性桎梏的意识，其实 Outland 就要做这个桥梁作用，让他怎么能够意识到能够利用技术去做这些事情，在一个新的语境当中有东西可以去表达。在这个过程中我们遇到了很多困难，将困难一一化解之后形成了现在项目的一个基本局面。\n\n但是我想聊的东西要稍微深层一点，就是什么是艺术。在我看来的话，艺术是能触碰人心灵的东西，不管是当代艺术家还是 web3 原生艺术家，其实肯定有一些东西是打动你了。有一个项目是来自印尼的小伙子，把自己每天的照片拍了一年，放到 Opensea 上，卖得还是非常好的。其实这个东西在我看来有一个打动人的地方，就是在 web2 当中并不会引起大家注意的一个东西，在 web3 得到一个价值的肯定。\n\n所以我觉得应该找到一个东西，无论是现代的还是传统的，都是一个工具，可以帮助我们去穿通歧视和不公平，能够让大家意识到好的氛围和有趣的地方，这是 web3 打动我的地方。\n\nweb3 突破了原有作品的边界，把作品边界和真正购买 NFT 的人连接到一起，中间的这个过程其实具备很大的革新性，让艺术家和对自己作品感兴趣的人连接到一起。\n\n从这个角度来看，这也是符合艺术的规律。之前艺术的革新只发生在作品的内部，未来到了 NFT 领域可以将革新从创作的单边过程，变成一个完全双向或者多向的过程。我相信这是无论当代艺术家还是加密艺术家非常友好的地方。\n\n**@AnnieYi**\n\nHello 大家伙，很高兴能够邀请 Hyphen 这么年轻的艺术家和 Outland 这样的优秀平台一起 AMA，我感到非常荣幸和骄傲。\n\n其实我自己是 James Jeans NFT 的持有人，Hyphen 知道我非常喜欢他，在全球买他的版画。但是我要说一下，我觉得碎片化的叙事方式，并没有把 JJ 的叙事性打破。我自己很喜欢的一点事，他的画特别有趣，有非常多的细节，每一朵花每一个角落，每一件东西都有诗意般的叙事能力，但是当它拆成 NFT 之后，变成了不同的叙事碎片，其实既可以拆解，又可以拼起来，所以艺术变成 NFT 是一个特别梦幻的联动。\n\n比如说来自 16 个国家的艺术家并没有见过面，更多的就是透过一个核心叙事，大家共同创造，通过机器随机生成，生出全球独一无二的样子。所以如果打开 Opensea 看到那些图多么丑，由科学家在淘宝随便找个人画的土狗项目的时候，你真的觉得艺术应该要进入 NFT 里面，因为我们把整体艺术交给全球有钱的买家，很多商人到最后靠买艺术品展现自己的品牌，有些商人会开以自己名字命名的美术馆，像美国纽约那边有很多，来供大家欣赏。你会发现艺术一直是一个非常高成本的东西，但是通过 NFT 让每一个年轻人享受审美，持有审美，而且是全球独一无二随机性的审美，这是一个很浪漫的过程。\n\nHyphen 也可以分享一下，他在做 Theirsverse 的时候，其实是有很大的核心思想，他认为艺术不是一个自私跟自我满足的过程，每一个持有人都参与了创作。我认为 NFT 跟艺术未来是应该紧紧绑在一起。\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Theirsverse）**\n\n我觉得很重要的一点是 web3 的去中心化概念，不仅是技术上的去中心化，同时也是理念上的。不再看什么是主流、什么是非主流，什么是正确的审美，什么是不正确的审美。\n\nTheirsverse 的 Slogan 就是“不完美，即是完美”。这个完美不是说每个人都有自己的完美，现在社会对完美只有一个一致的定义，同时这个定义又在变化，很多人回去盲目跟随。特别是在web2 社交媒体上，很多人去看网红，修图美颜到完全不真实的姿态，全部都很自我。web3 所有都和你的环境和社群有关，非主流才是真正的主流，每个人都可以找到喜欢自己艺术创作形态的人，我觉得这是很重要的，这是 web3 最看好的地方。\n\n很多人对 web3 有质疑，这也是可以理解的。我经常跟朋友你去想手机是好是坏，好的地方是你可以随时跟亲戚、朋友、恋人说话，很方便很发达，但同时也有隐私这些问题，最终还是取决于用户。\n\n我不能以 web3 做保证，但是我能保证我们的社区是以连接人们为中心的，我希望做一种互动性的艺术，而不是 everything is about me，像是在一个艺术馆里面去看一副作品。我大概一开始作画的时候就有这种感觉，不是以自私的心态去创作艺术，反而是以交流的心态，比言语更升华的一种互动。所以 Theirsverse 是一个平等的多元文化的社群。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\n从 Beeple 的 NFT 拍出 6900万 美元天价一举成名开始，似乎代表着 NFT 开始带着艺术行业走向另一个全新的方向，但是 Merch 某种程度上意味着艺术的价值正在向传统靠拢，怎么看待这种反叛与回归的结合？\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\n我们一开始的时候其实也请教到像 Beeple 这些在 web3 非常成功的艺术家，有关于艺术这个赛道在未来的发展方向。同时也有很多其他朋友接触到我们来聊可以不可以进入加密艺术领域。我相信像娱乐、电影、大众流行文化相关的东西，落地到 web3 当中去的时候，可能我们现在的讨论都不再是一个问题，包括它应该是更倾向于线上，还是要和线下联动，我觉得也不再是一个问题，到那个时间点我期待的是物联网的达成，区块链作为底层技术更加方便的生活场景的普及，那时候应该不存在传统艺术还是 web3 艺术，只存在大家喜欢或者不喜欢的艺术，无论是传统艺术像加密艺术反叛或者反过来，都是可以随时发生和接受的。\n\n比如说我们接下来即将要推出的一个项目，可能会一反像 James Jeans 从观念故事性上去推出的 NFT，和实物之间有一个密切的连接。现在这个项目是技术导向的，我们从 Artblock 等生成艺术上获得了很多灵感，就是在目前这个时间点，我们应该把艺术往哪个方向去浅浅地推进一下，其实在一个比较广泛的视野当中，还缺少一个原生于区块链属性的作品，我们和艺术家之间进行沟通，去创作一个这样的作品，通过 AI 算法根据你的交易判断性格，做出时间线上的变化，哪怕交易之后也能够记住上一个主人的特点，这也是一个非常不一样的角度，一个非常原生 web3 的角度去跟艺术家合作。\n\n所以我们其实并没有限定我们自己是传统的，还是 web3 的，我们更希望看到更多有趣的项目通过各种各样的方式出现，当这样的东西越来越多的时候，那可能这个问题就会消失掉。\n\n**@AnnieYi**\n\n我其实蛮遗憾的，大家提到 Beeple 的时候都在关注拍出了多么高的价格，是不是第一个艺术 NFT，却没有人看过这一幅画。我想应该没有人像我一样，认认真真去打开 5000 幅画来看吧，他其实是把这十四年的生活，每一天画一幅画。成为数字艺术之后，可以碎片化去持有，想象我是一个有钱人去买了这个 NFT，我把我家的墙投影出来这 5000 张画，这就是一堆数码影像，但是当我把它每一张打开的时候，有几幅画是我自己非常非常喜欢的。我希望大家在理解艺术之前，要了解它是怎么撼动人心的。\n\n虽然 Therisverse 很幸运，发行 4 个小时就售罄，在熊市 0.18e 也不算便宜，很多 freemint 项目都没有发完也没有人领。我们在 24 小时登上了 Opensea 第五名。但是我依然希望大家看到这 16 个年轻的艺术家，每一个系列背后的灵魂，每一幅画都画了好久。我们总共做了 4 次生成，这在其他项目绝无仅有，包括 Hyphen 他很坚持一些东西。所以说不要看成绩有多少，整个 Theirsverse 艺术创作花了一整年，而 Beeple 用了十四年，没有人知道，认为他只是一个普通插画师，他的老婆怀孕，他穷得不行的时候没有人看见。\n\n所以这也是我非常喜欢 Outland，在整个 web3 行业里面的作用。当你在熊市中打开小狐狸钱包，不是一张丑到不行的作品，没有任何审美意义。你知道这是艺术家付出了时间，是艺术家的心血，付出了跟世界的对话，跟自己的和解，跟世界的抗争。Hyphen 在画的时候是一个卡夫卡的读者，是一个虚无主义的小孩，他把 Theirsverse 画得像翻白眼一样，我是怕卖不出去，但是他有他的抗争。\n\n所以每一个艺术背后都不是随随便便的，我自己比较遗憾的一件事情是，像 BAYC 背后的画家，到现在已经几乎完全被遗忘了，而且她还是一个亚裔。所以艺术一定要有改革，排挤出那些土狗项目和仿盘，发挥出中本聪真正去中心化的理念，让更多年轻的艺术家不用等到 45 岁或者更久之后，才有机会出来跟跟大家交流，这是 web3 最大的价值。\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Theirsverse）**\n\n我好像是 15 岁左右，开始喜欢法国哲学家，对存在学很有兴趣，会读卡夫卡那类的书。我印象很深刻的一个主题是，我们人类的存在比我们的理由先到来。我读的时候有点奔溃，人类这么有智慧的生物，有那么多无尽的选择，我们其实活在一个最差的宇宙。我们有那么多选择，反而活得那么忐忑和慌张，运作在腐朽的政治之上，女生不能主宰自己的身体，他们如果不想生一个小孩，还要违法去堕胎。所以那时候我想做另一个宇宙，大家都可以更好做自己的版本，那个对我来说成长影响蛮大的。\n\n@**guooooog**\n\nNFT 纯数字化和经典的实物艺术作品，这里面有一个词叫在场，很多艺术创作印刷出来看和你现场欣赏完全是不一样的。NFT 有“在场”吗，在场性还很低，当你用眼睛去看手机、看一个屏幕，范围很小，未来如果 AR/ VR 起来之后，在元宇宙里面去看，场景是不一样的。所以实物还是解决了一些在场性的问题，就是你观看屏幕和你拿到实物去细细地品是不一样的，我觉得这是很有意思的一个事情。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT Collector & Investor）**\n\nOutland 作为艺术类 NFT 运营得非常好的平台，非常注重线上线下的互通以及社区文化的建设，请问艺术类 NFT 可以为不能从美术馆、拍卖会的购买艺术品（高净值客户，物单价高），大多数人带来什么？\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\n这也是传统艺术会面临的问题。之前跟方老师之间有一个聊天，有些很大牌的艺术家进入一个误区，当他背后有一个非常有实力的人可以去支持他创作自由的达成，在原来中心化时代里面，他们做的一个事情就是把源远流长的艺术史价值化了，这个东西的背书要远远大于某一方的努力，如果 outland 只是从运营和市场价值角度把桥梁搭建起来，其实还是需要一个新的推动建立在大家的共识之上，很多土狗项目有值得大家学习的地方，就是他们在凝结共识的过程当中可以摒弃很多不同的意见，那这个东西的话其实在传统艺术是完全没有出现的。我们应该如何去看待呢，你发现很多土狗项目虽然过几天就下去了，但是并没有如大家想象的那样完全归零，反而是最开始建构得非常好的项目，最后可能并不是运营得特别好。所以到底什么是最核心最主要的，这是一个很有意思的问题。\n\n另外一方面来讲，高净值用户和人群，他们进入艺术之前的惯性，是这个时代局限决定的。我也跟很多线下的投资人和收藏家聊过天，其实他们对传统的美术馆的话也不是很满意。那 NFT 出现之后，我还是这个观点，现在客观情况出现了明显的分野，但是后续发展不见得不可以把 web2 比较有价值的作品带到 web3 里面来。比如说我们在 Merch 之后的安排当中，方老师可能愿意拿出自己不同时期留藏得版画作品，拿出来到 Merch 当中去，让大家更多从价值角度体会到 web3 时代的到来。\n\n**MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）**\n\n想问一下 **Hyphen** 你是如何跟全球十多位艺术家合作，怎么领导设计这些pfp，有什么意义\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Theirsverse）**\n\n我们设计环节最重要的一部分就是全部手绘的，每一个艺术家自己选择要做什么 collection，每个人都会研究很久。其中一个核心概念就是，如果我们要讲一个不是我们的故事，不是有历史年代性和文化根底的故事，一定要穿透到表达的本质。我非常执着于研发的过程，其中一个 collection 印象蛮深刻的，本以为会是很浮夸和女性化的，我看到之后反而觉得特别好，并没有哪些固有的预设，并且是在我和那位艺术家完全没有串通好的情况下。\n\n还有另一个 collection 特别能体现目前年轻人的迷惘跟堕落感，活在一个科技感，但是又随时有可能被战争和政治毁灭的世界，我觉得蛮能体现自己对未来的憧憬和现况的失望，对我自己冲击蛮大的。我没有问那个艺术家是不是有这样的创作意图，但是我自己看到的感觉是这样的。这也就是我为什么觉得艺术这么有趣，因为每个人都有自己的解读和深刻的体会。\n\n**MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）**\n\n我们知道Theirsverse计划设立年轻艺术家基金，并且已经在全球多地开展青年论坛，Hyphen可以具体分享一下吗?\n\n因为最开始做这个项目史灵光一闪，最开始跟我妈开了一个买手店，放了一些名牌产品。我就想这些牌子都已经这么有名了，还需要我们帮忙卖吗，直接去旗舰店买不就好了。我觉得反而这种买手店需要给更多年轻艺术家平台，不仅仅是衣服、还包括音乐、艺术等等。那时候我就觉得要做这么一个平台，让年轻艺术家把自己作品宣发到全世界的媒介。\n\n因为我觉得传统的艺术阶层很分明，如果你红的话可以一直红下去，如果没红的话就永远不会红，很棒的是经过这么多年，我们有了 web3 这么一种技术跟机会，成立年轻艺术家基金会，给那些比我还有才华，又没有那么多资源的艺术家扶持。\n\n我们会组织各种各样的论坛，每个人都要跟世界有交流，第一是去了解跟你不一样的人，第二是看到即使我们在完全不同的体系长大，感受到的情绪可以是一样的，每一个打动人的故事都可以引发共鸣，我们做这个平台就是要产生不同的共鸣，这是对我来说很重要的东西，找到一种宇宙性的语言，让世界各地的艺术家来讲故事，每个人都可以讲自己的故事，还可以了解到你的故事是有人聆听的。在这么一个安全的地方讲故事之后，可以再去现实世界讲更多的故事。\n\n\n---\n\n```\n

That is the place where I used to work and live for eight years. A soft care.\n\nThe mountain wind blows the morning mist, like strips of white satin, gently and slowly, wrapping the scattered villages with a thin layer of soft yarn. The bamboo buildings with unique style and unique style are hidden by big banyan trees, mango orchards and coconut groves by the side of the village. When you look around, everything here is dyed emerald green.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t1c6DXM1QLLBdplrVws3R.png?height=270&width=402)\n\nKapok on the edge of the village, with open arms, blooming with red buds, can't wait for the foil of green leaves to ignite the passion. Amorous peach blossoms, like pink clouds, are printed and dyed among the green trees, like the blush on the face of a shy girl, adding a bit of tenderness. The paddy field stretches out to the side of the mountain, blooming among the bamboo trees, and sketching among the paddy fields. The rice fields in spring are even more fascinating. When the industrious children of the Dai people plant the seedlings on the side of the mountain, they also endow the rice fields with extra beauty. The scattered rice fields are filled with clear mountain springs, such as the magic mirror scattered among the mountains of Ailao, reflecting the colorful clouds, splendid rainbows, everything in the world, and the most beautiful scenery in the world. The sun shines on the water, emitting sparkling waves. The vast tranquility and tranquility, the same mottled and overflowing reflection, is like a landscape painting, supporting a thick and dignified line of blue sky. Relying on diligence and intelligence, the Dai family has created a splendid imprint of civilization here. Pieces of rice fields connect the Dai villages, mountains and nature so harmoniously.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vgdMnAdP2COSuiS-pmgpS.png?height=266&width=414)\n\nStepping on the bamboo bridge, bypassing the water-filled stream, I was immersed in an ancient dream. There was a mist of rain in the sky, only the sound of the rain falling on the bananas, and only the light raindrops fell on the newly-haired green leaves and safflower, which made the natural green and red look so delicate. The drizzle was lingering, and the whole village was moistened. The green rain and fog lingered like a thin white veil, covering the strangeness of the village, but it also added a bit of mystery to the original beautiful scenery.\n\nStanding on the bamboo building paved by Miba, the greenery of Bazi came to his eyes. Coconut groves are chasing green clouds, sugar cane overflows with mellow sweetness, and tea leaves are fragrant and intoxicating everywhere. There are dense greens everywhere, and green tides everywhere. Looking at the sky and the earth, occasionally a shadow of the mountains is revealed. Among the green waves, the big banyan trees that cover the ground, the verdant phoenix-tailed bamboos, and the fruit-bearing betel nut all decorate the charming Dai bamboo buildings.\n\nFlowing quietly through the small river between the bamboo buildings, slapping the eternal dream of the bamboo buildings. The stockade was quiet. In the depths of the bamboo forest, a girl from the Dai family walked by carrying water, and her long tube skirt swayed with Ana's body. Dai girls are demons made of water, and water is the soul of the Dai family. The bamboo building is accompanied by water, and the sound of the spring is ding-dong, adding a kind of leisure, a kind of elegance, a kind of calm, not to mention the water here, and the bamboo building. Natural harmony, simple and beautiful bamboo building, inherits the gentleness of water and the eternity of spring!\n\nThe fragrance of dendrobium flowers fills the bamboo building, the cactus fence is full of flowers, the phoenix-tailed bamboo is rustling, the mango can be touched, and the grapefruit that bends the branches is beating against the eaves of the bamboo building. Walking into the bamboo building, the gentle and watery Dai girl will come slowly, bring a cup of glutinous rice fragrant tea, gently put the tea down, and then smile. The colorful tube skirt, the fragrant breath, the faint tea fragrance, and the sweet smile, like a dancing peacock. Walking into the quiet and peaceful bamboo building, you will have the feeling of past life and present life. This feeling, as if traveling through the ancient time and space, waiting for thousands of years, fluttering in the heart.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2Z5BWaIQexkgD6shdN8pR.png?height=266&width=463)\n\nThe sunset is gradually melted away by the green, and the sunset is dressed in a light green and beautiful wedding, slowly pulling the full moon behind the mountain. Cicada Feather's moonlight slides from the roof to the balcony. The tall banana leaves slowly hold up Haoyue, the moon in Dai Village, savoring the green night sky, and feeling the vicissitudes of time. The rain forest is soft and moist, the coconut trees are slim, and the phoenix tails and bamboos are affectionate. Sitting on the balcony paved by Zhuba, the laughter washed away the exhaustion. At this time, the bamboo building is full of warmth, auspiciousness and happiness.\n\nIn the aroma of tea, the moonlight comes from the branches and leaves, and diffuses into the lake of people's hearts. The gurgling water in the bamboo forest, now reflected in the moonlight, looks particularly cool. The breeze is coming, and the night sky is filled with fragrant fragrance, which makes people excited, and the feeling of a lifetime is suddenly lifted. In the verdant phoenix-tailed bamboo forest in front of the bamboo building, Xiaobu's long and affectionate singing, accompanied by the chirping of insects, drifted far and far with the evening wind.\n\nThe gentle singing, flowing with the breath of the Dai family, is soft and soft, like a hand plucking your heartstrings, the original Dai family charm will always be lingering in my heart. At this time, the moon became charming and beautiful, and the Dai girl who was bathing by the river felt comfortable, shy, and laughter with silver bells. The brisk drum beats and the melodious sound of gongs flew to my ears. The girl from the Dai family who followed the sound walked towards the boy who was like a madman, dancing lightly on the moon, singing flowing water. The girls looked at their lover with honey-flowing eyes, and colorful sunlight flashed in their eyes. Shuangshuang hides under the big banyan tree, or sits in the banana bush, the flowers are fragrant, the moonlight is melting, and the two loving hearts turn into thousands of words to pour out their hearts. With a little relief, the bamboo building in the wind is slowly intoxicated.\n\nThe bamboo building under the moonlight is extraordinarily enchanting, and this bamboo building is an eternal witness. It reflects the tenderness and the vicissitudes of life. On such a moonlit night, sitting quietly in front of the window of the bamboo building, the night wind blows the bamboo forest, The moonlight and the singing meet, and at this time, there is a quiet mood, which dissolves in the emotion of life like a dream.\n\nThe bamboo building under the moonlight and the bamboo building in the wind have also become my soft concern. The moon is still full of fantasy, people have been separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, but the same deep thoughts.", "timestamp": 1658287238, "digest": "EFduuWFn8eHanOhfBOY5zSuVKHJTNJEf-wsWiquBim0", "contributor": "0xfE5d245154a4B93d296B3A8F9128e4fcC35DEb80"}
{"id": "R0AWJrUqfteCqy5-YVMjeRtPSIhEh64pZGcIi2vdH1U", "title": "#Winning", "body": "This week I had planned to write on the topic of doxing, or more specifically, about the question of “to dox or not to dox”, and the choice for, or against, web3 anonymity. As inspired as I initially felt to explore it, once I sat down to outline it the work began to feel like a grind. Then, as I often do these days when feeling stuck, I turned my attention to twitter for a daily download of crypto news and DAOist musings. Somewhere in my feed, from someone I had never heard of, there appeared the following,\n\n“You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.\nThat’s why every quarter, I evaluate myself and my friends on 3 key criteria:\n\n* Income\n* Fitness\n* Influence\n\nAnyone who scores below me is cut off.\nComplacency is the first step towards mediocrity.”\n\nA day later, though I don’t recall all the details of my reaction, I think it a safe bet it included some combination of a furrowed brow, my best [gas face](https://gfycat.com/decimalreasonableanophelesmosquito) and nausea.  All of that before I fired back with the first thing to come to mind as a counter blow.\n\n“Congratulations on a life devoid of either giving or receiving unconditional love. You’re winning though. 👊”\n\n[https://twitter.com/HAshBrown_27/status/1548437771974348801?s=20&t=4QqD9qeeewCOpN7zYUJ16g](https://twitter.com/HAshBrown_27/status/1548437771974348801?s=20&t=4QqD9qeeewCOpN7zYUJ16g)\n\nSoon after that I turned off my computer and went out for the day. Honestly, I don’t think it occurred to me that I would even look at the tweet again. To the contrary, as someone new to twitter this year, I expected my response would go largely ignored, joining my 20-or-so other tweets in the land of twitter oblivion. To my surprise though, when I returned home several hours later, I noticed my twitter notification bell ringing, alerting me to the fact that my response had close to 200 likes. 20 hours later that number is now up to 488. Not that I’m counting.\n\nI’m new to this twitter thing, and as far as “likes” are concerned, have only facebook likes of posts of my kids, mountain views and fishing pictures to compare it to. 488 likes seems like a lot though. So while it may be small potatoes to seasoned tweeters with big followings, I’m a babe in the woods here, feeling pretty proud of that 488 thank you very much. Ooh, lookie there, just shot past 500. Am I going viral? LFG!!!\n\nSeriously though, upon looking into the phenomena of my most-liked social media entry ever, I see the person I responded to has a lot of followers. 6,075 to be exact. And digging a little deeper I realize he likely intended his tweet as satire. Gas face rescinded. Perhaps the joke is on me for responding to it.\n\nSatire or not, and irrespective of whether his friendship circles have anything to do with crypto and Web3, [@_mihir](https://twitter.com/__mihir?s=20&t=iOpvhasWZtEkPYiiXfkDYw) points to something very concerning to me about Web3 culture and the playing field of web3 identity. Playas gonna play. So how will Web3 define winning?\n\nBefore we get into all that I sense some context would be helpful.  A man in my early 50’s, I am at most a social media dabbler. I have a facebook page that I post on occasionally and to keep up with the lives of my 926 friends. I have created a few blogs over the years that I have enjoyed writing on but never broadcasted. Instagram? Ohhh hellll no….except to check in on the lives of my college-age children. I regard the notion of creating a web “identity” as near hostile to my bias for real-life interaction with others and time outdoors. And other than a short list of physical ailments, I can’t think of anything I’d like less than “followers”.\n\nSo what am I doing here worrying and writing about Web3 culture?  Fair question. What can I say except [orange pills](https://ryanslot.substack.com/p/what-it-means-to-be-orange-pilled#details) are a thing. [Green pills](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylewestaway/2022/06/16/how-crypto-can-regenerate-the-world/?sh=7ed83b602fd3) too. I’ve fallen down a [crypto rabbit hole](https://garywoodfine.com/going-down-the-crypto-rabbit-hole/) and I can’t get up!\n\nThe truth is that while I wrestle with mixed emotions about getting involved, I am thankful for crypto’s role in opening my mind (🤯) and luring me beyond my comfort zone.  For every horror story of greed, theft and exploitation related to this new frontier, I find most of what I read about the space to be inspiring.  To quote the immortal words of Buffalo Springfield, [“Somethings Happening Here”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQUj56sqicU), 2020’s style, and most days I want to be a part of it.\n\nOne example of this is an article, [“The Future of Work”](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-future-of-work), by David Hoffman. David makes a strong case for why Digital Organizations (DO’s), enabled by the blockchain and tokenized incentives, will present unprecedented opportunities for humans to coordinate both our hearts’ and minds’ shared interests to do purposeful work together.  Among the many lines to strike a chord with me David writes,\n\n“If you are a young person, looking for purpose, meaning, and eventually a salary, establishing yourself as a strong DOer is one of the best footholds you can establish for yourself….If you believe DOs are the future, you should start DOing now, so that you become the scarce resource for both DOs and people who need help DOing.”\n\nRelative to the audience David likely had in mind I am not a “young person”. That said, aside from a rather curmudgeonly attitude toward social media, I pride myself at being young in spirit. I am DOing (and DAOing) now and, in time, aspire to be among the scarce, most valued resources of the space. So what game am I playing? And what was it about @_mihir”s tweet that bothered me so?\n\nThough it has been over 20 years since I worked as an equity analyst at an investment brokerage firm, that work, and my short time in the industry, taught me some valuable lessons. The most memorable of them is the difference between the “game” of judging companies’ worth on the basis of quarterly performance vs. that of valuing them (or not) on the basis of fundamental strengths relative to longer-term investment horizons. The former game is played to generate transactions that pay brokers and their firms. The latter is played to maximize investors’ returns.\n\nWeb3 playing fields, DOs and DAOs included, will create whole new worlds from which to relate to the earth, token projects, and one another. There will be more games to go around than anyone can count in the space’s many arenas. Short-term trading, of crypto and people, can be fun, even profitable. Patient investment, in the people and projects that mean the most to us, can change the world. Web3 only wins by changing the world.", "timestamp": 1658287237, "digest": "BHhF8Dl9ohYnhMtphcJCsOiUQVUPJgVVLr0anB-LiAE", "contributor": "0xF64C845aC5b14cf8DD500B3eCD4CC57Cd414c391"}

", "body": "As of July 15, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows that the market has been suffering from “Extreme Fear” for 70 consecutive days, a record high. Although it seems that the market hasn’t been so volatile in July, it remains fundamentally bearish, and the bankruptcy of top institutions did create negative market sentiments. To date, U.S. CPI soared 9.1% over the past year, the largest increase since November 1981, and global finance continues to suffer from a liquidity crunch.\n\nAs the market has just gone through a deleveraging campaign with far-reaching implications, cryptos like BTC and ETH fell below their price peaks recorded during the last market cycle. However, the market has gradually absorbed the panic impact, and there have been signs of a market rebound. According to CoinEx, a crypto exchange, the BTC price recently returned to over $22,000.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wO0DXmTsUAKNaHSAkyGT1.png?height=493&width=1280)\n\nETH, on the other hand, hit $1,500. It should be noted that in the last bear-bull cycle, the market recovery was also driven by increases in the ETH price.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pTfoKMP028yH3ONXF9OmN.png?height=507&width=1280)\n\nAs Bitcoin and Ethereum record consecutive price growths, DeFi tokens have also become more valuable. Does this mean that a new market cycle has started? Let’s take a closer look at the current market in terms of active addresses, the inflow/outflow of money, and market fundamentals. As BTC and ETH led market recoveries during previous cycles, we will examine the relevant statistics of the two.\n\nAccording to on-chain data, Bitcoin’s active addresses increased by 2.44% in the past seven days, and the number of zero balance addresses went up by 5.92%.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qGACWxcZH4ubCgSuSoqnl.png?height=527&width=1280)\n\nEthereum’s active addresses, on the other hand, grew by 9.98% in the past seven days, and the number of zero balance addresses went down by 3.05%. Meanwhile, on July 18, the number of addresses holding at least 1 ETH hit 1,554,716, an all-time high.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xVu3CIbRttcxPnZ3jXvgj.png?height=534&width=1280)\n\nIn terms of the inflow/outflow of money, although both BTC and ETH come with positive inflows, the latter shows stronger momentum.\n\n![Historical In/Out of the Money (BTC)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9B4p_KL-8i1dvFntL68A_.png?height=544&width=1280)\n\n![Historical In/Out of the Money (ETH)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ci0w-pAbJvUOsAgSoHPJa.png?height=585&width=1280)\n\nBased on the current round of price growth, Ethereum has indeed outperformed Bitcoin. It is reported that Bitcoin’s third largest whale has made multiple outgoing transfers since the early morning of July 19. As of this writing, the address has transferred 15,500 bitcoins that are worth about $350 million.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AEqqYQBILotqfncKuiF5N.png?height=172&width=1280)\n\nLet’s now turn to the fundamentals. As global finance faces a liquidity crunch, the crypto market hasn’t been able to stay intact. The market panicked when crypto companies collapsed one after another a while back. However, the deleveraging caused by the liquidity crisis has also optimized the internal capital structure of the market and excluded more hot money. At the same time, new institutional investors are making a push into cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to the information disclosed so far, 40 fundraisings happened last week, and a16z and Sequoia Capital both took action. In particular, the scale of these fundraisings was small, with only three projects raising over $50 million. A report by The Block Research shows that the amount of VC investment in the blockchain space has declined for the first time since Q2 2020. The figure stood at $9.8 billion in Q2 2022, down by approximately 22% compared with the last quarter. Although the market is picking up strength, the fundraising statistics show that institutions remain extremely prudent.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VDDIY_rhEEBTx9wi03K3f.png?height=720&width=1079)\n\nAny industry that seeks growth must go through multiple market cycles. From 2000 to 2002, the dot.com bubble triggered a bear market due to excessive valuations and speculations, but this did not affect its subsequent growth. Today’s crypto market is just the same. The momentary setbacks will help it find better growth drivers in the future.\n\nAs the crypto industry advances, all kinds of new functions and categories have emerged. Meanwhile, the entry threshold has kept going up, which has discouraged many who hope to join the crypto market. While everyone in the crypto space is working on more new functions, one exchange called CoinEx is striving to “slim down” its products. To impress the world with the efforts made by the crypto market, the team is making many complex projects and tools more user-friendly. The exchange intends to make crypto trading easier and welcome investors from all sectors to the crypto space.\n\nToday’s cryptocurrency, like the Internet, exists to make the world a better place.", "timestamp": 1658287917, "digest": "c9MzHbTLPdAKowxyECNZYJWsYZlfmO3rZm-fHpuPQHE", "contributor": "0x159251c5f13184863a9F972d0950d3E032216E8C"}

{"id": "Wv_5Kflvm5-ei8bqW9RsMVwqBAIVoPi3rAm9leptwBI", "title": "Opera Crypto Browser布局iOS", "body": "Opera于4月15日星期五发布了其Web3浏览器的测试版，其中包含内置加密钱包，适用于iOS，iPhone和iPad设备。自一月份以来，Opera的Crypto Browser已适用于Mac和Windows桌面用户以及Android手机用户。在其功能列表中，目前已经可以见到多个与Web3和加密领域密切相关的特性。同时Opera Crypto Browser集成了非托管加密钱包，支持ETH、Polygon和Celo等区块链生态系统，能够在无需第三方应用程序的情况下购买加密货币。\n\n此外该浏览器还能够直接访问去中心化交易平台、基于Web3的NFT、游戏和去中心化应用。其涵盖了超过7000个基于Polygon的服务，用户可像访问Web2上的任何网站一样，无缝体验Web3服务。\n\n在移动设备上发布是Crypto Browser Project的最新步骤，这是一项以Web3为重点的举措，旨在促进分散式应用程序（DApps），游戏和元界平台之间的导航。\n\n根据Opera的说法，这些关键功能包括一个Opera钱包，支持以太坊，多边形和Celo生态系统，用于购买，出售和转移代币。用户还可以将以太坊虚拟机（EVM）兼容的钱包与本机Opera钱包一起恢复，并集成其现有资产和余额。\n\n在浏览器主页上，用户可以查看最新的顶级NFT销售和新闻聚合器，称为“加密角”，其中包含加密资产价格和汽油成本的实时更新，以及空投甚至建议的教育资源。\n\n该公司还表示，该浏览器带有加密货币挖掘保护，可阻止可能损害iPhone或iPad设备性能的“加密劫持”脚本。其他安全功能包括原生广告和跟踪器阻止程序、弹出窗口阻止程序和直观的 Cookie 对话框阻止程序。\n\n根据Cointelegraph援引Opera移动执行副总裁Jorgen Arnesen的说法，Crypto Browser的目标是对Web3的兴趣日益浓厚，无论是资深加密用户还是新手。\n\n“Opera的Crypto Browser项目旨在简化经常使主流用户感到困惑的Web3用户体验。Opera认为Web3必须易于使用，才能充分发挥其潜力并大规模采用。\n\n此外，这家浏览器公司正在增加对八个主要区块链生态系统的支持——比特币、Solana、Polygon、StarkEx、Ronin、Celo、Nervos Network和IXO。Opera表示，他们计划在未来整合更多的权益证明链。\n\n经过上述的描述，我们可以非常轻松的得出一个结论——Opera Crypto Browser是一个Web 3浏览器。可面对这个概念，却还是难免感到一头雾水。究竟什么是Web 3浏览器呢？\n\n## 什么是Web 3浏览器？\n\n如果你在浏览器上查看一个网站，这其实是软件处理各种功能的结果，其本质是从解析网站地址到从网站所在的服务器上提取内容的过程。其底层原理是，浏览器只是一个通往互联网的窗口。这意味着你只需在电脑上存储最低限度的数据并进行最低限度的处理就可以访问网站和应用程序。\n\n而Web3浏览器则超越了这一点，在理想化的情况下，它只是一个空壳，而用户体验所需的所有其他必要工具都是从去中心化的网络中提取的。\n\n区块链基础设施公司Lukso的创始人Fabian Vogelsteller在2015年表示，Elthuny基金会的团队试图构建一个名为Mist的真正的Web3浏览器。它只是一个基于Electron的外壳。\n\n但是这种方法的问题是，它在区块链中运行一个完整的节点，所以当你启动浏览器时，它需要同步所有在你离线时创建的区块数据。而这一过程无疑会拖慢整个进程。作为一个终端用户，很难想象，使用者会为了访问一个网站而愿意忍受漫长的等待。\n\n诸如此类的问题，再加上Electron平台的不安全特性，促使该团队在2019年关闭了该浏览器项目。这就引出了现有浏览器如何处理去中心化网络的问题。\n\n## Web 3浏览器的现代发展\n\n目前，现代浏览器能够处理Web3的应用程序，但用户需要做一些工作才能顺利访问。例如，如果用户使用Chrome浏览器，其就必须安装一个类似于Metamask的去中心化钱包扩展程序来连接到DApps，并修改其DNS设置以访问一些Web3域名。\n\n有一些浏览器提供了某种程度上的原生Web3体验，有内置的钱包和基于Web3的域名支持。例如Opera、Brave等，他们甚至试图简化程序。例如，在设置过程中Opera会要求用户创建一个同其钱包相联系的@opera用户名，这样用户就可以用它来代替42个字符的字符串，在各个应用程序中方便识别自己。\n\n## Web 3浏览器产品分析\n\n一、Opera Crypto Browser\n\nOpera浏览器发布于1996年，其最初并非是区块链浏览器，但在后续改进过程中创新性的添加了区块链钱包，并逐步扩大对区块链技术的适用，时至今日，逐步成为以区块链见长的浏览器。Opera内置Opera钱包，支持ETH、TRX、CBK、Polygon、Celo等区块链网络，具有网页浏览速度快、节约流量等优势。因为其对于数据的消耗相当保守，所以Opera在互联网基础设施较差的环境中很受欢迎。\n\nOpera还旨在提供个性化的网络浏览器。这对某些用户来说似乎很有吸引力，但 个性化的选择意味着在隐私保护方面必然有所舍弃，因为个性化浏览器体验可能需要收集用户的个人信息。不过各取所需，倒也合情合理。\n\n此外，Opera浏览器还提供多种功能，比如提供免费VPN、可恢复EVM钱包、cookie对话框拦截器、加密货币挖矿防护机制、以及原生的广告追踪拦截器等，但用户必须自行设置才能使用。\n\n## 二、Brave浏览器\n\nBrave浏览器是由Brave Software创建的Web浏览器，该应用由Brandon Ike创立。\n\nBrave浏览器拥有快速的网页浏览速度和广告拦截功能。用户可以查看到目前为止已屏蔽了多少广告以及保存了多少数据。\n\n此外，Brave通过提供小部件形式的赞助广告来支持加密货币投资，允许用户购买加密货币并查看市场价格。Brave浏览器正在尝试加强个人信息保护，并支持具有很强匿名性的搜索引擎Tore。此外，Brave为用户免费提供VPN，但目前仅适用于ios，无法在PC和Android上使用。\n\nBrave还为区块链用户提供加密货币钱包。目前支持以太坊网络，整体功能和UI与Metamask类似。但是，Brave浏览器作为广告浏览器受到了很多质疑，特别是其因为在过去输入特定的加密货币交换地址时会自动完成作为推荐地址的设置而受到用户的批评。\n\n此外，Brave还有观看广告可以获得奖励的程序，即以观看Brave提供的广告作为奖励获取方式。如果用户选择观看广告，Brave浏览器将通过推送，间歇性通知用户收看广告。当用户点击推送时，将获得Brave的奖励代币BAT（Basic Attention Token）。但也有不少负面评价认为，与广告曝光频率相比，补偿力度不够。此外，Brave浏览器也存在收集用户的个人信息以有效地提供广告服务的可能性。\n\n## 三、Osiris浏览器\n\nACENT旗下的Osiris浏览器是一个基于区块链的网络浏览器。Osiris浏览器与Opera和Brave的不同之处在于，Osiris浏览器的用户群体是以区块链用户为主的。\n\nOsiris是现有的唯一一款将ETH、BSC、DOT、TRX 和ACE等众多区块链主网集成到一个平台的网络浏览器。\n\n为了提高区块链用户的便利性，项目方在Osiris浏览器内设置了多功能钱包“Metawallet”，该钱包可以使浏览器支持各种加密货币交易。Osiris Meta Wallet的最大缺陷在于只能在Osiris浏览器上使用，其他浏览器目前仍没有可用的扩展程序。就安全性而言Meta Wallet比现有的扩展钱包更加安全，其所支持的区块链网络数量目前来看也是最多的，未来也许将有更多区块链主网加入Osiris浏览器。\n\nOsiris浏览器面向区块链用户，具备基本浏览器的功能，在此基础上其还拥有极为显著的区块链特性。\n\n对于一般的浏览器用户，Osiris浏览器提供了自由选择搜索引擎的选项，同时提供屏蔽广告和增强隐私的Osiris Armor。用户可以使用Osiris Armor设置隐私选项，并查看目前为止已阻止的广告和脚本数量。\n\n此外，Osiris还为区块链用户提供了DApp Store——一个DApp集结的总平台。不得不说，这对区块链用户而言是个相当友好的功能，DApp Store是最适合Osiris浏览器的优化DApp市场，目前也正在快速的拓展全球市场。\n\nOsiris浏览器不同于其他区块链浏览器的最大优势在于，Osiris有自己的主网。\n\n目前，其自主研发的主网已经适用于Osiris浏览器，在全球范围内是首个适用自主研发主网的浏览器。\n\n## Web3浏览器面临的挑战\n\nWeb 3浏览器当今面临的最大挑战之一还是兼容性的问题。换句话来说，用户必须知道其使用的是什么代币，以及一个特定的应用程序在什么区块链协议上运行。\n\n例如，如果用户正在Chrome上使用MetaMask，其可以使用所有基于以太坊的区块链和应用程序。但如果用户需要使用Solana支持的应用程序，那他就需要再另外安装一个Phantom钱包。\n\n除此以外，我们还不得不关心安全问题。在Web3的初期阶段，许多不法分子利用网络钓鱼将用户引诱到欺诈性网站，窃取他们的资产。目前，Opera已经提供了一个带有快捷方式的集中中心，可以方便地引导用户访问合法网站。\n\n根据Vogelsteller的说法，在用户体验Web 3之前面临两大障碍。\n\n首先是需要记住12个字的助记词，并理解这种认证方法背后的安全原因。\n\n其次是需要Ether做任何事情，考虑到加密货币的价格以及涉及的燃料和交易费用等因素，这样的行动逻辑成本未免太高。\n\n浏览器可以通过与不同的合作伙伴合作来解决第一个问题，但第二个问题仍是顽疾。\n\n## Web3浏览器的未来之路\n\n目前，体验Web3对于绝大多数用户仍是一个难题，普通用户需要处理相当陡峭的学习曲线。甚至在Web3体验的起点就是一个42个字符的冗长地址。\n\n这些复杂的代码也使用户难以了解其所有者的声誉和身份。虽然在某些情况下匿名性是很好的，但它也使得这种结构对于信任的建立也无疑设置了极高的壁垒。\n\n除此之外还有一些问题，比如应该在这里使用什么代币、应用程序在哪个区块链上工作、它们是否相互配合等。想象一下，仅仅为了发送一条推特，甚至需要进行十几次的操作。这就是目前Web3的使用感受。\n\n未来，Web3浏览器和通用配置文件等标准无疑是需要协同工作的，也只有这样才能简化这些复杂的流程。彼时，用户也许就不必再担心后端协议的世界了，那里有更容易记住的用户名，以及与每个身份相关的可解析信息。加上区块链本身透明化、不可篡改的特性，无疑会打开新世界的大门。", "timestamp": 1658287911, "digest": "QaZinCG8SI0Ojj6eu41EmjdrpER135D0ZobkekftD_k", "contributor": "0xa1923FB3ff4e7ed8766EC98E61Ac979F59009aFc"}

As of this writing, the address has transferred 15,500 bitcoins that are worth about $350 million.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AEqqYQBILotqfncKuiF5N.png?height=172&width=1280)\n\nLet’s now turn to the fundamentals. As global finance faces a liquidity crunch, the crypto market hasn’t been able to stay intact. The market panicked when crypto companies collapsed one after another a while back. However, the deleveraging caused by the liquidity crisis has also optimized the internal capital structure of the market and excluded more hot money. At the same time, new institutional investors are making a push into cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to the information disclosed so far, 40 fundraisings happened last week, and a16z and Sequoia Capital both took action. In particular, the scale of these fundraisings was small, with only three projects raising over $50 million. A report by The Block Research shows that the amount of VC investment in the blockchain space has declined for the first time since Q2 2020. The figure stood at $9.8 billion in Q2 2022, down by approximately 22% compared with the last quarter. Although the market is picking up strength, the fundraising statistics show that institutions remain extremely prudent.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VDDIY_rhEEBTx9wi03K3f.png?height=720&width=1079)\n\nAny industry that seeks growth must go through multiple market cycles. From 2000 to 2002, the dot.com bubble triggered a bear market due to excessive valuations and speculations, but this did not affect its subsequent growth. Today’s crypto market is just the same. The momentary setbacks will help it find better growth drivers in the future.\n\nAs the crypto industry advances, all kinds of new functions and categories have emerged. Meanwhile, the entry threshold has kept going up, which has discouraged many who hope to join the crypto market. While everyone in the crypto space is working on more new functions, one exchange called CoinEx is striving to “slim down” its products. To impress the world with the efforts made by the crypto market, the team is making many complex projects and tools more user-friendly. The exchange intends to make crypto trading easier and welcome investors from all sectors to the crypto space.\n\nToday’s cryptocurrency, like the Internet, exists to make the world a better place.", "timestamp": 1658287945, "digest": "vTh9DKSGfcBI-mi4xDOtV_qt0bXL2a__NwT2sN2f4nY", "contributor": "0x159251c5f13184863a9F972d0950d3E032216E8C"}

{"id": "PE_3vrcqP_fhtyG4bz7lJ_aSnUOAGyLpjawxAjBvmOM", "title": "X to Earn：对死亡螺旋的正式挑战", "body": "作者：Andy, IOSG Ventures\n\n编辑：Elaine，IOSG Ventures\n\n本文仅做行业学习交流之用，不构成任何投资参考\n\n**写在前面**\n\n自Axie Infinity大火后，类Axie的Play to Earn游戏们雨后春笋般一茬又一茬的冒了出来，然而在Axie给币圈和游戏圈表演了一段精彩的死亡螺旋过山车后，目前还没能出现一款真正能和Axie的精彩故事媲美的P2E游戏：市值不够、热度不够、创意不够，或者单纯的还没做好 😛\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fbGPwW1DscwhrBi0ornWN.png?height=495&width=670)\n\n结果是Axie的P2E不光给其他链游上了一课，同时也给了同样聪明的非链游市场一个灵感：如果Play to Earn能火成这样，那别的X to Earn (X2E)是不是也有机可乘？于是最近两个月市场终于看到了在Axie之后、再一次让我们感受到精彩的X2E产品：**STEPN**。\n\n其他研报复述多次的产品介绍我这里就先一句话概括：**STEPN是一款 Move to Earn游戏，用户购买跑鞋NFT来跑步赚取代币 - 当前STEPN已拥有1百万用户、30万DAU，治理代币市值从IEO的8百万，于不到两个月的时间直达200亿**。\n\n由于此文发布时STEPN依旧属于上升期，很多已经入场或在场外观望、甚至其他X2E的创业者都在密切关注一个问题：STEPN什么时候到达最高点开始进入死亡螺旋？非常能够理解在Ponzinomics (旁氏经济) 下，死亡螺旋是市场不可逃避话题。然而在市场趋向X2E热度继续疯狂发力时，我们不仅不能对死亡螺旋避而不谈，反而更应该主动去了解死亡螺旋代表着什么，挑战如何在死亡螺旋的阴影下将项目做的长久，怎样的运营和理念才能在死亡螺旋的阴影下让用户、项目方与投资者同时最大化长期价值。那么在STEPN当前获取极大热度的时间点、也在更多的X2E产品到来之前，笔者在此文将借用Axie和STEPN的案例，来对死亡螺旋这件事本身提出几个希望对市场有帮助的观点。\n\n## 废话不多说，先上结论：\n\n虽然死亡螺旋对Ponzinomics来说不可避免，但这篇文章想说明以下几点：\n\n* 首先**死亡螺旋的结果不是死亡，更不代表产品的失败，而是从X2E的疯狂回归至产品本身的公允价值的过程**，而这个过程发生前的潜伏期有长有短，发生时的下降速度有快有慢，发生后回归到的公允价值有高有低。\n* Axie作为第一个火的X2E项目经历了很多trial and error，为后面的产品展示出了X2E的可能性、局限性、以及长时间运营下会遇到的挑战，从而让我们看到了如STEPN这样的项目在学习过程中取其精华努力创新 - X2E正在进化。\n* 而我们期待的**X2E的进化，正是更克制的疯狂期、更慢速的退烧期，更高的公允价值回归线**- 这也是我认为STEPN有潜力做到的。\n* 在这之外更重要的是能够最终做到，**让认可项目公允价值本身的用户变为主流，使utility价值投资者而非投机者获取大部分收益。（能够教育市场参与这样的X2E项目不是简单的投10块赚20块，而是投10块不光值了项目本身带来utility的价值，还额外返还了3块；并且对于坚持下去的用户额外奖励，可以达到10块甚至20块返还的可能性。）**\n* 未来的故事中**Ponzinomics之外的经济来源是我对X2E很期待的地方，因为比当前链游的P2E更有故事和空间**：比如最近我们刚聊到一个早期的Bike to Earn的项目（MOTE by Sweetgum Labs，有兴趣的投资人欢迎一起交流）提到了碳排放变现回流经济，那么举个例子的话，一个本来每天开车往返10公里上班的人改为每天骑车，一年可以省下4吨的碳排放，而一吨碳排放在欧洲当前可以价值80欧元，就意味着**理论上一个人一年可以变现300多欧元来回流到经济系统**，而将来碳排价格的提升会让此机制更增加潜力。虽然会有很大的可行性上的挑战（比如碳排交易所是否认可其碳排资质），但X2E产品在向外部经济回流这个方向努力，是我最期待看到的。\n\n**沉默成本与意外回报**\n\n## 一、投资亏损的沉没成本接受度\n\n先从一个例子讲起：健身卡这东西相信大家都不陌生；而办卡后第1个月一周练三次、第10个月三周练一次的故事估计大概率也不陌生；最后如果你这张卡过期后一段时间重燃斗志、又走了一遍如上的循环，那你我就是一家人了。为什么我们允许自己一次又一次的投入不小的成本，但又反反复复投降于低自制力，让这样的循环一直在发生？一次循环没成功的人，是不是又像忘了教训一样发誓“下次一定”，重新再踏上这条路呢？\n\n一个关键的心态是**对沉没成本的宽容度**：办卡本是对自己体型和健康（**utility**）的投资，而过了兴奋期后健身卡上的蜘蛛网则是意志力宣布这份投资失败、以及对成本沉默的和解。\n\n听起来可能没什么感觉，那我们粗略量化一下：5000多人民币的健身年卡本来的购买目的为督促你一周跑3次每次5公里，而你最终只坚持了前两个月，那么本来购买时认可的5000块的投资回报为13公斤，最后回报为2.3公斤，为原本ROI的15% → 大部分人看到这里的反应大概率是”对不起，下次还敢“，然后再办卡。然而试想如果这是各位投资股市、区块链的ROI，还会继续”下次还敢“吗？**同为投资亏损，很容易看出大家对财务投资的沉没成本宽容度低，而与之相比，对utility（体型/健康/快乐等）投资的沉没成本宽容度高了太多**。\n\n## 二、STEPN：到底是你的财务投资软件还是utility投资（健身）软件？\n\n**STEPN投资者的意外回报**：举一个很多Stepn玩家可能多少都会有共鸣的例子：一个体验过Axie的朋友差不多一个月前入场，本来入场目的和当初玩axie一样都是赚钱，再额外加上跑步的形式比游戏更少费脑子，且少了“玩游戏浪费时间”这样的阻力，所以在同样的时间成本下选择了Stepn；但随着这一个月每天为了赚GST按时下楼跑步，发现了Stepn带给自己的意义和自己当初的预期有了变化：本来最重视的是多久回本，平均每天跑一次能让我赚多少钱（财务回报），但后来居然被之前没怎么在意的财务之外的回报震撼到：每天运动40分钟带来的精神状态的改变，对下班后懒惰宅家的改变，开始与身边家人一起出门运动的改变，减肥失败多年但这次居然一月瘦两斤的改变，对自己身体健康更加在意的改变。\n\n对这个朋友来说，Stepn本就是一个跑步+赚钱项目，用户当然在入场时自然会对两边都有所期待，但微观下的参与过程还多了一个关键的心态变化：从抱着财务收益最佳的目的来，但**经过了长时间的坚持发生了心态变化，认可并感激了STEPN给他带来了财务回报之外的收益，也就是utility上的收益。而这恰恰是Axie Infinity缺失的。我们都说Ponzigames（旁氏游戏）的结局都是死亡螺旋、曲终人散，但上述STEPN多出来的这份心态转变，或许会成为一个改写结果重要因素。**\n\n**不可避免的死亡螺旋，不代表死亡**\n\n## 一、首先定义三类玩家：\n\n**幸运的A类玩家、担忧的B类玩家和观望的C类玩家**：上文例子中提到的那位朋友是一个月前进入的，此时即将回本 - 我们不妨将这类已回本（或即将顺利回本）的玩家称为**幸运的A类玩家**- 由于游戏的机制没有给鞋设定生命周期，那么A类玩家回本后只要愿意坚持则会永远赚下去。那么在看完A类回本用户后，作为Ponzinomic（旁氏经济学）类产品的两个灵魂问题来了：\n\n1）买鞋不久还没回本的人还能不能/多久回本？这类玩家我们暂且叫做**担忧的B类玩家。**\n\n2）还没入场买鞋但在观望的朋友到底还能不能入场？这类玩家我们暂且叫做**观望的C类玩家。**\n\n这里澄清一下这里的A、B、C类玩家不是固定的用户，而是一个时间节点下的用户群分类，对于个人来说是可转化的：B类玩家花了一定时间回本后会成为A类，而C类入场后又会变成B类。\n\n## 二、STEPN的死亡螺旋，会和Axie Infinity有何区别？\n\n无法辩解的一点是Ponzinomics的确避免不了死亡螺旋，但我认为同是死亡螺旋，STEPN和Axie的经历和结果将有3个有意思的区别（again非投资建议）：**1）STEPN的死亡螺旋潜伏期可能更长；2）STEPN的死亡螺旋的连锁反应速度可能更缓慢；3）STEPN的死亡螺旋后的平缓期或许有更大前景**。下面我们来具体讨论。\n\n### 1）STEPN的死亡螺旋潜伏期可能更长（警告！理论分析非投资建议）：\n\n* **Axie：**\n\n**a. 拥抱了公会的Axie经历了疯狂的非自然增长**- 玩家中只有15%为个人用户，85%为不需要拥有Axie即可参与SLP产出的公会用户。公会提供了手把手级别的教程拉新人加入，通过较短的时间可以让玩家快速上手开始打金，由公会管理来直接安排最优的yield策略让大量快速加入的公会玩家产出最大量级的SLP。\n\n**b. 大量的公会和雇佣兵保持了远大于自然玩家对经济系统的榨取效率**：这时的公会玩家不属于前文STEPN分析中提到的A、B、C类玩家，而是单纯的雇佣兵，用来最大化榨取Axie infinity的福利，而这样的榨取效率是比同样数量的自然增长的个人玩家高出许多。快速的榨取速度让公会和雇佣兵们尝到甜头继续扩张，而享受着快速增长的sky mavis并没有对这样的高效价值榨取有过多的干预，或者说公会的势头 (momentum) 已经不允许sky mavis踩刹车，所以高效率的价值榨取与高速的非自然增长代表着更短的Ponzi产品生命周期，最终我们看到的是从21年7月初开始发力的AXS，在4个月后的11月初来到了自己的最高点，正式进入死亡螺旋。\n\n**c. 而公会和雇佣兵或许是Axie必须吞下的慢性毒药**：如果当初没有公会呢？Axie是否能靠自然增长将那4个月的时间拉长到6个月？甚至10个月？或者说如果没有工会，那么Axie是否因为增长不够快而吸引不了新鲜血液，导致会更早的戛然而止？我没有一个确切的结论，但我偏向相信Axie是无法依靠自然增长的，只能吞下公会这颗救命毒药 - 传统的游戏玩家遇到这样干燥简单的游戏，是不太愿意主动花高价钱进场肝着受罪的，而菲律宾等发展中国家少了公会的帮助，复杂的加密代币系统天然的屏障会让大量较低学习能力、经济能力的用户敬而远之，所以公会是Axie近乎必然的选择，可能明明知道可能带来对经济的后果，但依然是必须吞下的慢性毒药。\n\n* **STEPN：**\n\n**a. 坚决保持自然增长，打击作弊、拒绝公会、没有租赁**：作此文时官方刚刚宣布达到300K的DAU，于Axie很大的区别在于这300K DAU基本都是实实在在的“一人一机一号”的真实玩家 - 没有工会、没有租赁，需要入场需要自己学习如何使用加密代币，需要从自己的腰包里掏钱，很难作弊 - 在STEPN官方多重的严格监控和打击下极难实现非自然增长。Jerry和Yawn两位创始人在多次分享中表达过对自然增长的坚持，且唯一白皮书中于非自然增长相关的租赁功能，Jerry在我专门的提问中也确认过仅会在很后面开，且确认半年内不会上。\n\n**b.项目方对代币经济的运营也非常克制：**STEPN的邀请码机制一定程度缓解了进场速度过快，推出的宝石和开箱玩法在愈加努力地消耗着GST，近期给治理代币GMT增加了的需求点也是在间接分担GST的压力，且未来也会给GMT更多功能。可以看到游戏背景的项目方在传统游戏与P2E案例中借鉴和创新了多个方法来努力维持代币经济的稳定，来尽可能延长Axie走短的路。\n\n**c.有钱、爱学习的真实玩家，和破圈带来的高质量圈外新玩家**：这样的坚持和克制导致带来的用户群体是经过经过两层筛选的：有钱（入场费的确不便宜，而且都要自掏腰包），有学习能力/知识（STEPN软件里没有冗长的新用户玩法介绍，需要玩家自己学习去搞清楚钱包的用法和逻辑 - Jerry提到问卷调查显示有30%的用户是第一次使用去中心化钱包）。\n\n**d. 如果项目方想，随时可以选择打开非自然增长的阀门来延缓死亡螺旋的到来（虽然短期内不会）**：虽然我们肉眼看到了快速增长的用户数据，但这样的数据已经是项目方克制的情况下增长的真实用户，对经济系统的价值萃取效率远远比不过Axie公会就算慢慢到了后期开始增长乏力，如果STEPN想要打开阀门降低用户筛选门槛，我相信后期靠非自然增长也可以一定程度上继续推迟死亡螺旋的开始的。\n\n### 2）STEPN的死亡螺旋的连锁反应速度可能更缓慢：\n\n* **Axie：**\n\n  **a.死亡螺旋虽然是连锁反应，Axie的下降快非断崖式下跌**：其实当我们看AXS在死亡螺旋开始后的市值，虽为连锁反应，也并非断崖式的下跌。原本的回本速度在下跌中被拉长，但如果用户愿意是依然可以坚持肝 (grind) 慢慢回本的，不过这是一个痛苦的过程，因为游戏本身的可享受游玩 (enjoyable gamplay) 时长是有限的，而后期为了财务回报慢慢回收成本则是折磨和煎熬。\n\n  **b.由于资产提供不了太多财务投资之外的意义 (utility)，抛售是简单明确的选择**：对于大部分用户来说，除了打金属性之外，游戏意义并不大，换句话说如果你作为一个真实用户真的投了自己的钱去玩Axie，除了回本目的以外，游戏本身带来的享受/utility过低，导致你在死亡螺旋进行时只剩下财务投资回报降低的懊恼，那么最理性的做法就是早点跑路走人，且你会大概率选择此理性的做法。因为游戏中有很多个跟你一样想法的人，这也是死亡螺旋导致的崩盘速度虽然不会断崖，但也不会是缓坡。\n* **STEPN：**\n\n**a. 用户在参与过程中对财务回报之外的utility回报的认可**：回顾文章一开始我那位朋友的故事 - 主要因为财务投资的目的参与STEPN，但过程中逐渐意识到了utility（体型/健康/快乐）方面的投资回报。那再回到我文章最开始提到的部分：同为投资亏损，很容易看出大家在现实生活中对财务投资的沉没成本宽容度低，而与之相比，对utility（体型/健康/快乐等）投资的沉没成本宽容度高了许多 - 那么在STEPN的场景下，这种多出来的宽容有什么样的体现呢？下面我们具体分析：\n\n**b. 与Axie不一样在于，STEPN给了一部分认可utility回报的用户一个不抛售的选择**：所以一个关键的问题就来了：假设你在死亡螺旋开始的最顶点投入了1000美元进去，坚持每天跑了一个月发现之前50天回本的目标拉长到了一年甚至更久，但突然发现自己获得了那么多财务回报之外的utility回报，你会怎么做？\n\n1. 赶紧卖掉所有财产止损，回归每天宅家不运动的懒惰生活？\n   * 肯定自己这段时间的坚持和utility回报、意识到回本的愿望慢慢从一个投资期待摇身一变成了帮自己坚持下去的承诺，从而决定不抛售/少抛售，并把本来两个月的回本战线拉满一年甚至更多、慢慢把成本跑回来？\n\n**或者说只要你愿意留下坚持运动，你就能越来越健康、就能迟早回本、迟早开始净赚；而选择抛售会让你有直接财务损失，且没有了外界的推动力而慢慢放弃一个非常好的生活习惯。**我觉得你看到这个问题已经开始考虑自己的选择，而非像上文中Axie用户的选择一样单一快速的话，那STEPN死亡螺旋时的下跌就可能就会比Axie更缓慢。\n\n**c. 问卷显示有83%的用户期待自己在死亡螺旋中不跑路**：我们再看一个例子，是我在STEPN reddit上的发的一个用户调研（如下图）：当STEPN进入像Axie一样的死亡螺旋后，你会对你的财产做什么？我本来的期待是大部分人会选择卖掉所有财产离开，但最终结果确是60%选择了基本不会卖GMT和鞋且准备继续跑下去，23%选择了会留下关键的鞋（比如1灰、或1绿8灰），而只有17%的人选择了全部变卖：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K8_kmNH3IaQn_HDVw_Sxi.png?height=301&width=916)\n\n这套问卷当然没有法律效应，所以虽然最终价格开始下跌时，现在说不卖的到时候可能还是会卖，但我相信这样的调研结果绝不是在Axie那边可以看到的。也就是说我认为死亡螺旋开始后的变卖压力有较高概率会比Axie低，下降坡度会更缓慢，回本周期受到的负面影响与普通链游相比更小，因为一部分用户在参与过程中会向utility投入做出一定转变，导致对原本投资回报敏感度降低，而更focus在utility的回报。\n\n### 3）STEPN的死亡螺旋后的平缓期或许有更大前景：\n\n* **Axie：**\n\n  **a. 死亡螺旋的结果不是死亡，而是慢慢显露出产品对市场的公允价值 (fair value)**：经历过死亡螺旋的大幅下跌后，现在AXS的市值已经稳定在3 billion的平缓期近三个月了，Axie的价格降低到更多人较易获取 (accessible) 的50美元左右一只。这时入场的投入门槛低，但回本周期依然长，不过因为游戏本身带给玩家的utility回报（游戏乐趣）有限，以回本和净赚为目标的玩家依旧会感受到折磨。而且对于总玩家中那85%的公会雇佣兵来说，Axie的产出 (yield) 已经低过了现实中的工作，参与率下降，反而之前有兴趣尝试Axie但嫌门票贵的真正的玩家，也就是”**观望的C类玩家**“们有机会进来尝试，意味着死亡螺旋让Axie过了快速膨胀宣传期、终于有了欢迎真实玩家入场的机会。回本周期拉长的公会和收入降低的雇佣兵们不开心，但死亡螺旋引起的下跌还是给最需要享受其游戏乐趣的广大真实玩家带来了机会。我和一起看游戏的同事Alex都认为P2E不是目的，而是获客方式（UA）- Axie的故事以不成熟方式间接印证了这一理论：P2E的狂欢让Axie省去了冷启动买量的步骤，得以早期快速获得大量资金、用户以及打磨产品的机会，经历死亡螺旋后入场门槛恢复到了游戏自身的公允价值 (fair value)，由真正为了玩这款游戏的玩家（而非投机者）来参与以及取代。\n* **STEPN：**\n\n**a. STEPN死亡螺旋后也会稳定在比Axie更高的平缓期价值，且会有比当前更多的用户和更大的市场**：当最便宜的灰鞋价格从1000刀下降到比如100刀时，虽然回本周期很长（比如一年），坚持不下去的玩家的投入就变成了沉没成本来pay坚持下去的玩家，但只要你坚持下去，系统就会奖励你回本，因为当投入从1000刀降低到100刀时，玩家会对自己的沉没成本更加宽容，导致无法坚持下去的人更多，沉没成本收集的更多，这时会形成一个比较稳定的balance，于上文中AXS当前稳定下来的价格类似。这时STEPN已经从一个赚钱项目摇身一变成了一款对赌协议：花100刀买一个监督自己坚持跑步的项目，当你坚持下去不光可以回收那100刀，甚至可以继续稳定的赚钱，how does that sound？\n\n**b. 仿盘可以撑的了一时但成不了一事，不会影响STEPN的长期价值**：那么聪明的小伙伴们可能就要问了，那我作为玩家到时候找个仿盘继续跑能赚的更多，为什么要继续在STEPN上呆着？我觉得这方面可以看看Axie：仿盘数量谁也比不上Axie，那Axie的仿盘都是什么样的结果？虽然有人能赚到钱，但它们周期更短，市值更小，且对真正赚钱的玩家要求不是一般的高：要深刻学习到有哪些高产出 (yield) 的项目、谁在做盘、是否进的够早、什么时候得跑 - 的确到时候会有一波对财务投资回报敏感的STEPN的用户去仿盘尝试赚钱，但终究仿盘们会die down，会让这些人受伤后、带着运动的习惯，重新回归到经过时间证明的、yield较低但稳定的STEPN；而这只是财务投资回报敏感的用户，那么更偏重utility投资回报的用户是不太愿意花如此多精力时间冒仿盘的险，而这也是STEPN用户和Axie用户的最大区别 - Axie的公会玩家可是需要用这笔钱过日子的，怎么能不用最大努力来最大化回报？再加上STEPN后面的社交属性和其他叙事 (narrative)、以及依靠自己最大体量发育起来旁氏经济之外的资源和资金流入能力（比如电商、碳排放、品牌合作等）以及创始人们的叙事 (narrative) 能力、用户的真实度和高质量，我相信STEPN或许可以成为一个比Axie更能站到最后的品牌。\n\n**总结**\n\n虽然死亡螺旋对Ponzinomics来说不可避免，但我写这篇文章的目的是想说明以下几点：\n\n1. 首先死亡螺旋的结果不是死亡，更不代表产品的失败，而是从X2E的疯狂回归至产品本身的公允价值的过程，而这个过程发生前的潜伏期有长有短，发生时的下降速度有快有慢，发生后回归到的公允价值有高有低。\n   * Axie作为第一个火的XXX赚钱项目 (或者叫X2E) 经历了很多trial and error，为后面的产品展示出了X2E的可能性、局限性、以及长时间运营下会遇到的挑战，从而让我们看到了如STEPN这样的项目在学习过程中取其精华努力创新 - X2E正在进化。\n   * 而我们期待的**X2E的进化，正是更克制的疯狂期、更慢速的退烧期，更高的公允价值回归线**- 这也是我认为STEPN有潜力做到的。\n   * 在这之外更重要的是能够最终做到，**让认可项目公允价值本身的用户变为主流，使utility价值投资者而非投机者获取大部分收益。（认可参与这样的项目不是简单的投10块赚20块，而是投10块不光值了项目本身带来utility的价值，还额外返还了3块；并且对于坚持下去的用户额外奖励，可以达到10块甚至20块返还的可能性。）**\n   * 未来的故事中Ponzinomics之外的经济来源是我对X2E很期待的地方，因为比当前链游的P2E更有故事和空间：比如最近我刚聊到一个Bike to Earn的项目（MOTE by Sweetgum Labs，有兴趣的投资人欢迎一起交流）提到了碳排放变现回流经济，那么举个例子的话，一个本来每天开车往返10公里上班的人改为每天骑车，一年可以省下4吨的碳排放，而一吨碳排放在欧洲当前可以价值80欧元，就意味着**一个人一年可以变现300多欧元来回流到经济系统**，而将来碳价的提升会让此机制更增加潜力。虽然肯定会有很多操作和价格上的挑战，但X2E产品在向外部经济回流这个方向努力，是我非常期待看到的。\n\n**写在最后**\n\n说了这么多我认为STEPN比Axie具有优势的地方，再强调一遍这并非投资建议，因为项目的运营除了基本面以外，很大程度上取决于掌权者和大户参与者 - STEPN能第一时间让三大交易所合作，以及whale拉盘时的慷慨都展示了很多STEPN在基本面之外的一些实力。最终STEPN的发展方向终归还是取决于项目里各种重要要素之间的利弊平衡以及动荡不安的市场。以上的分析是基于目前得到的各方面信息推测STEPN后面可能经历的一些节点和潜力，最终如何，就让我们拭目以待。", "timestamp": 1658288757, "digest": "8cY5OlN-4LnTjiCe3u1vwOkLpZIcpkervvi1V9U-pAA", "contributor": "0xa1923FB3ff4e7ed8766EC98E61Ac979F59009aFc"}

当前STEPN已拥有1百万用户、30万DAU，治理代币市值从IEO的8百万，于不到两个月的时间直达200亿**。\n\n由于此文发布时STEPN依旧属于上升期，很多已经入场或在场外观望、甚至其他X2E的创业者都在密切关注一个问题：STEPN什么时候到达最高点开始进入死亡螺旋？非常能够理解在Ponzinomics (旁氏经济) 下，死亡螺旋是市场不可逃避话题。然而在市场趋向X2E热度继续疯狂发力时，我们不仅不能对死亡螺旋避而不谈，反而更应该主动去了解死亡螺旋代表着什么，挑战如何在死亡螺旋的阴影下将项目做的长久，怎样的运营和理念才能在死亡螺旋的阴影下让用户、项目方与投资者同时最大化长期价值。那么在STEPN当前获取极大热度的时间点、也在更多的X2E产品到来之前，笔者在此文将借用Axie和STEPN的案例，来对死亡螺旋这件事本身提出几个希望对市场有帮助的观点。\n\n## 废话不多说，先上结论：\n\n虽然死亡螺旋对Ponzinomics来说不可避免，但这篇文章想说明以下几点：\n\n* 首先**死亡螺旋的结果不是死亡，更不代表产品的失败，而是从X2E的疯狂回归至产品本身的公允价值的过程**，而这个过程发生前的潜伏期有长有短，发生时的下降速度有快有慢，发生后回归到的公允价值有高有低。\n* Axie作为第一个火的X2E项目经历了很多trial and error，为后面的产品展示出了X2E的可能性、局限性、以及长时间运营下会遇到的挑战，从而让我们看到了如STEPN这样的项目在学习过程中取其精华努力创新 - X2E正在进化。\n* 而我们期待的**X2E的进化，正是更克制的疯狂期、更慢速的退烧期，更高的公允价值回归线**- 这也是我认为STEPN有潜力做到的。\n* 在这之外更重要的是能够最终做到，**让认可项目公允价值本身的用户变为主流，使utility价值投资者而非投机者获取大部分收益。（能够教育市场参与这样的X2E项目不是简单的投10块赚20块，而是投10块不光值了项目本身带来utility的价值，还额外返还了3块；并且对于坚持下去的用户额外奖励，可以达到10块甚至20块返还的可能性。）**\n* 未来的故事中**Ponzinomics之外的经济来源是我对X2E很期待的地方，因为比当前链游的P2E更有故事和空间**：比如最近我们刚聊到一个早期的Bike to Earn的项目（MOTE by Sweetgum Labs，有兴趣的投资人欢迎一起交流）提到了碳排放变现回流经济，那么举个例子的话，一个本来每天开车往返10公里上班的人改为每天骑车，一年可以省下4吨的碳排放，而一吨碳排放在欧洲当前可以价值80欧元，就意味着**理论上一个人一年可以变现300多欧元来回流到经济系统**，而将来碳排价格的提升会让此机制更增加潜力。虽然会有很大的可行性上的挑战（比如碳排交易所是否认可其碳排资质），但X2E产品在向外部经济回流这个方向努力，是我最期待看到的。\n\n**沉默成本与意外回报**\n\n## 一、投资亏损的沉没成本接受度\n\n先从一个例子讲起：健身卡这东西相信大家都不陌生；而办卡后第1个月一周练三次、第10个月三周练一次的故事估计大概率也不陌生；最后如果你这张卡过期后一段时间重燃斗志、又走了一遍如上的循环，那你我就是一家人了。为什么我们允许自己一次又一次的投入不小的成本，但又反反复复投降于低自制力，让这样的循环一直在发生？一次循环没成功的人，是不是又像忘了教训一样发誓“下次一定”，重新再踏上这条路呢？\n\n一个关键的心态是**对沉没成本的宽容度**：办卡本是对自己体型和健康（**utility**）的投资，而过了兴奋期后健身卡上的蜘蛛网则是意志力宣布这份投资失败、以及对成本沉默的和解。\n\n听起来可能没什么感觉，那我们粗略量化一下：5000多人民币的健身年卡本来的购买目的为督促你一周跑3次每次5公里，而你最终只坚持了前两个月，那么本来购买时认可的5000块的投资回报为13公斤，最后回报为2.3公斤，为原本ROI的15% → 大部分人看到这里的反应大概率是”对不起，下次还敢“，然后再办卡。然而试想如果这是各位投资股市、区块链的ROI，还会继续”下次还敢“吗？**同为投资亏损，很容易看出大家对财务投资的沉没成本宽容度低，而与之相比，对utility（体型/健康/快乐等）投资的沉没成本宽容度高了太多**。\n\n## 二、STEPN：到底是你的财务投资软件还是utility投资（健身）软件？\n\n**STEPN投资者的意外回报**：举一个很多Stepn玩家可能多少都会有共鸣的例子：一个体验过Axie的朋友差不多一个月前入场，本来入场目的和当初玩axie一样都是赚钱，再额外加上跑步的形式比游戏更少费脑子，且少了“玩游戏浪费时间”这样的阻力，所以在同样的时间成本下选择了Stepn；但随着这一个月每天为了赚GST按时下楼跑步，发现了Stepn带给自己的意义和自己当初的预期有了变化：本来最重视的是多久回本，平均每天跑一次能让我赚多少钱（财务回报），但后来居然被之前没怎么在意的财务之外的回报震撼到：每天运动40分钟带来的精神状态的改变，对下班后懒惰宅家的改变，开始与身边家人一起出门运动的改变，减肥失败多年但这次居然一月瘦两斤的改变，对自己身体健康更加在意的改变。\n\n对这个朋友来说，Stepn本就是一个跑步+赚钱项目，用户当然在入场时自然会对两边都有所期待，但微观下的参与过程还多了一个关键的心态变化：从抱着财务收益最佳的目的来，但**经过了长时间的坚持发生了心态变化，认可并感激了STEPN给他带来了财务回报之外的收益，也就是utility上的收益。而这恰恰是Axie Infinity缺失的。我们都说Ponzigames（旁氏游戏）的结局都是死亡螺旋、曲终人散，但上述STEPN多出来的这份心态转变，或许会成为一个改写结果重要因素。**\n\n**不可避免的死亡螺旋，不代表死亡**\n\n## 一、首先定义三类玩家：\n\n**幸运的A类玩家、担忧的B类玩家和观望的C类玩家**：上文例子中提到的那位朋友是一个月前进入的，此时即将回本 - 我们不妨将这类已回本（或即将顺利回本）的玩家称为**幸运的A类玩家**- 由于游戏的机制没有给鞋设定生命周期，那么A类玩家回本后只要愿意坚持则会永远赚下去。那么在看完A类回本用户后，作为Ponzinomic（旁氏经济学）类产品的两个灵魂问题来了：\n\n1）买鞋不久还没回本的人还能不能/多久回本？这类玩家我们暂且叫做**担忧的B类玩家。**\n\n2）还没入场买鞋但在观望的朋友到底还能不能入场？这类玩家我们暂且叫做**观望的C类玩家。**\n\n这里澄清一下这里的A、B、C类玩家不是固定的用户，而是一个时间节点下的用户群分类，对于个人来说是可转化的：B类玩家花了一定时间回本后会成为A类，而C类入场后又会变成B类。\n\n## 二、STEPN的死亡螺旋，会和Axie Infinity有何区别？\n\n无法辩解的一点是Ponzinomics的确避免不了死亡螺旋，但我认为同是死亡螺旋，STEPN和Axie的经历和结果将有3个有意思的区别（again非投资建议）：**1）STEPN的死亡螺旋潜伏期可能更长；2）STEPN的死亡螺旋的连锁反应速度可能更缓慢；3）STEPN的死亡螺旋后的平缓期或许有更大前景**。下面我们来具体讨论。\n\n### 1）STEPN的死亡螺旋潜伏期可能更长（警告！理论分析非投资建议）：\n\n* **Axie：**\n\n**a. 拥抱了公会的Axie经历了疯狂的非自然增长**- 玩家中只有15%为个人用户，85%为不需要拥有Axie即可参与SLP产出的公会用户。公会提供了手把手级别的教程拉新人加入，通过较短的时间可以让玩家快速上手开始打金，由公会管理来直接安排最优的yield策略让大量快速加入的公会玩家产出最大量级的SLP。\n\n**b. 大量的公会和雇佣兵保持了远大于自然玩家对经济系统的榨取效率**：这时的公会玩家不属于前文STEPN分析中提到的A、B、C类玩家，而是单纯的雇佣兵，用来最大化榨取Axie infinity的福利，而这样的榨取效率是比同样数量的自然增长的个人玩家高出许多。快速的榨取速度让公会和雇佣兵们尝到甜头继续扩张，而享受着快速增长的sky mavis并没有对这样的高效价值榨取有过多的干预，或者说公会的势头 (momentum) 已经不允许sky mavis踩刹车，所以高效率的价值榨取与高速的非自然增长代表着更短的Ponzi产品生命周期，最终我们看到的是从21年7月初开始发力的AXS，在4个月后的11月初来到了自己的最高点，正式进入死亡螺旋。\n\n**c. 而公会和雇佣兵或许是Axie必须吞下的慢性毒药**：如果当初没有公会呢？Axie是否能靠自然增长将那4个月的时间拉长到6个月？甚至10个月？或者说如果没有工会，那么Axie是否因为增长不够快而吸引不了新鲜血液，导致会更早的戛然而止？我没有一个确切的结论，但我偏向相信Axie是无法依靠自然增长的，只能吞下公会这颗救命毒药 - 传统的游戏玩家遇到这样干燥简单的游戏，是不太愿意主动花高价钱进场肝着受罪的，而菲律宾等发展中国家少了公会的帮助，复杂的加密代币系统天然的屏障会让大量较低学习能力、经济能力的用户敬而远之，所以公会是Axie近乎必然的选择，可能明明知道可能带来对经济的后果，但依然是必须吞下的慢性毒药。\n\n* **STEPN：**\n\n**a. 坚决保持自然增长，打击作弊、拒绝公会、没有租赁**：作此文时官方刚刚宣布达到300K的DAU，于Axie很大的区别在于这300K DAU基本都是实实在在的“一人一机一号”的真实玩家 - 没有工会、没有租赁，需要入场需要自己学习如何使用加密代币，需要从自己的腰包里掏钱，很难作弊 - 在STEPN官方多重的严格监控和打击下极难实现非自然增长。Jerry和Yawn两位创始人在多次分享中表达过对自然增长的坚持，且唯一白皮书中于非自然增长相关的租赁功能，Jerry在我专门的提问中也确认过仅会在很后面开，且确认半年内不会上。\n\n**b.项目方对代币经济的运营也非常克制：**STEPN的邀请码机制一定程度缓解了进场速度过快，推出的宝石和开箱玩法在愈加努力地消耗着GST，近期给治理代币GMT增加了的需求点也是在间接分担GST的压力，且未来也会给GMT更多功能。可以看到游戏背景的项目方在传统游戏与P2E案例中借鉴和创新了多个方法来努力维持代币经济的稳定，来尽可能延长Axie走短的路。\n\n**c.有钱、爱学习的真实玩家，和破圈带来的高质量圈外新玩家**：这样的坚持和克制导致带来的用户群体是经过经过两层筛选的：有钱（入场费的确不便宜，而且都要自掏腰包），有学习能力/知识（STEPN软件里没有冗长的新用户玩法介绍，需要玩家自己学习去搞清楚钱包的用法和逻辑 - Jerry提到问卷调查显示有30%的用户是第一次使用去中心化钱包）。\n\n**d. 如果项目方想，随时可以选择打开非自然增长的阀门来延缓死亡螺旋的到来（虽然短期内不会）**：虽然我们肉眼看到了快速增长的用户数据，但这样的数据已经是项目方克制的情况下增长的真实用户，对经济系统的价值萃取效率远远比不过Axie公会就算慢慢到了后期开始增长乏力，如果STEPN想要打开阀门降低用户筛选门槛，我相信后期靠非自然增长也可以一定程度上继续推迟死亡螺旋的开始的。\n\n### 2）STEPN的死亡螺旋的连锁反应速度可能更缓慢：\n\n* **Axie：**\n\n  **a.死亡螺旋虽然是连锁反应，Axie的下降快非断崖式下跌**：其实当我们看AXS在死亡螺旋开始后的市值，虽为连锁反应，也并非断崖式的下跌。原本的回本速度在下跌中被拉长，但如果用户愿意是依然可以坚持肝 (grind) 慢慢回本的，不过这是一个痛苦的过程，因为游戏本身的可享受游玩 (enjoyable gamplay) 时长是有限的，而后期为了财务回报慢慢回收成本则是折磨和煎熬。\n\n  **b.由于资产提供不了太多财务投资之外的意义 (utility)，抛售是简单明确的选择**：对于大部分用户来说，除了打金属性之外，游戏意义并不大，换句话说如果你作为一个真实用户真的投了自己的钱去玩Axie，除了回本目的以外，游戏本身带来的享受/utility过低，导致你在死亡螺旋进行时只剩下财务投资回报降低的懊恼，那么最理性的做法就是早点跑路走人，且你会大概率选择此理性的做法。因为游戏中有很多个跟你一样想法的人，这也是死亡螺旋导致的崩盘速度虽然不会断崖，但也不会是缓坡。\n* **STEPN：**\n\n**a. 用户在参与过程中对财务回报之外的utility回报的认可**：回顾文章一开始我那位朋友的故事 - 主要因为财务投资的目的参与STEPN，但过程中逐渐意识到了utility（体型/健康/快乐）方面的投资回报。那再回到我文章最开始提到的部分：同为投资亏损，很容易看出大家在现实生活中对财务投资的沉没成本宽容度低，而与之相比，对utility（体型/健康/快乐等）投资的沉没成本宽容度高了许多 - 那么在STEPN的场景下，这种多出来的宽容有什么样的体现呢？下面我们具体分析：\n\n**b. 与Axie不一样在于，STEPN给了一部分认可utility回报的用户一个不抛售的选择**：所以一个关键的问题就来了：假设你在死亡螺旋开始的最顶点投入了1000美元进去，坚持每天跑了一个月发现之前50天回本的目标拉长到了一年甚至更久，但突然发现自己获得了那么多财务回报之外的utility回报，你会怎么做？\n\n1. 赶紧卖掉所有财产止损，回归每天宅家不运动的懒惰生活？\n   * 肯定自己这段时间的坚持和utility回报、意识到回本的愿望慢慢从一个投资期待摇身一变成了帮自己坚持下去的承诺，从而决定不抛售/少抛售，并把本来两个月的回本战线拉满一年甚至更多、慢慢把成本跑回来？\n\n**或者说只要你愿意留下坚持运动，你就能越来越健康、就能迟早回本、迟早开始净赚；而选择抛售会让你有直接财务损失，且没有了外界的推动力而慢慢放弃一个非常好的生活习惯。**我觉得你看到这个问题已经开始考虑自己的选择，而非像上文中Axie用户的选择一样单一快速的话，那STEPN死亡螺旋时的下跌就可能就会比Axie更缓慢。\n\n**c. 问卷显示有83%的用户期待自己在死亡螺旋中不跑路**：我们再看一个例子，是我在STEPN reddit上的发的一个用户调研（如下图）：当STEPN进入像Axie一样的死亡螺旋后，你会对你的财产做什么？我本来的期待是大部分人会选择卖掉所有财产离开，但最终结果确是60%选择了基本不会卖GMT和鞋且准备继续跑下去，23%选择了会留下关键的鞋（比如1灰、或1绿8灰），而只有17%的人选择了全部变卖：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K8_kmNH3IaQn_HDVw_Sxi.png?height=301&width=916)\n\n这套问卷当然没有法律效应，所以虽然最终价格开始下跌时，现在说不卖的到时候可能还是会卖，但我相信这样的调研结果绝不是在Axie那边可以看到的。也就是说我认为死亡螺旋开始后的变卖压力有较高概率会比Axie低，下降坡度会更缓慢，回本周期受到的负面影响与普通链游相比更小，因为一部分用户在参与过程中会向utility投入做出一定转变，导致对原本投资回报敏感度降低，而更focus在utility的回报。\n\n### 3）STEPN的死亡螺旋后的平缓期或许有更大前景：\n\n* **Axie：**\n\n  **a. 死亡螺旋的结果不是死亡，而是慢慢显露出产品对市场的公允价值 (fair value)**：经历过死亡螺旋的大幅下跌后，现在AXS的市值已经稳定在3 billion的平缓期近三个月了，Axie的价格降低到更多人较易获取 (accessible) 的50美元左右一只。这时入场的投入门槛低，但回本周期依然长，不过因为游戏本身带给玩家的utility回报（游戏乐趣）有限，以回本和净赚为目标的玩家依旧会感受到折磨。而且对于总玩家中那85%的公会雇佣兵来说，Axie的产出 (yield) 已经低过了现实中的工作，参与率下降，反而之前有兴趣尝试Axie但嫌门票贵的真正的玩家，也就是”**观望的C类玩家**“们有机会进来尝试，意味着死亡螺旋让Axie过了快速膨胀宣传期、终于有了欢迎真实玩家入场的机会。回本周期拉长的公会和收入降低的雇佣兵们不开心，但死亡螺旋引起的下跌还是给最需要享受其游戏乐趣的广大真实玩家带来了机会。我和一起看游戏的同事Alex都认为P2E不是目的，而是获客方式（UA）- Axie的故事以不成熟方式间接印证了这一理论：P2E的狂欢让Axie省去了冷启动买量的步骤，得以早期快速获得大量资金、用户以及打磨产品的机会，经历死亡螺旋后入场门槛恢复到了游戏自身的公允价值 (fair value)，由真正为了玩这款游戏的玩家（而非投机者）来参与以及取代。\n* **STEPN：**\n\n**a. STEPN死亡螺旋后也会稳定在比Axie更高的平缓期价值，且会有比当前更多的用户和更大的市场**：当最便宜的灰鞋价格从1000刀下降到比如100刀时，虽然回本周期很长（比如一年），坚持不下去的玩家的投入就变成了沉没成本来pay坚持下去的玩家，但只要你坚持下去，系统就会奖励你回本，因为当投入从1000刀降低到100刀时，玩家会对自己的沉没成本更加宽容，导致无法坚持下去的人更多，沉没成本收集的更多，这时会形成一个比较稳定的balance，于上文中AXS当前稳定下来的价格类似。这时STEPN已经从一个赚钱项目摇身一变成了一款对赌协议：花100刀买一个监督自己坚持跑步的项目，当你坚持下去不光可以回收那100刀，甚至可以继续稳定的赚钱，how does that sound？\n\n**b. 仿盘可以撑的了一时但成不了一事，不会影响STEPN的长期价值**：那么聪明的小伙伴们可能就要问了，那我作为玩家到时候找个仿盘继续跑能赚的更多，为什么要继续在STEPN上呆着？我觉得这方面可以看看Axie：仿盘数量谁也比不上Axie，那Axie的仿盘都是什么样的结果？虽然有人能赚到钱，但它们周期更短，市值更小，且对真正赚钱的玩家要求不是一般的高：要深刻学习到有哪些高产出 (yield) 的项目、谁在做盘、是否进的够早、什么时候得跑 - 的确到时候会有一波对财务投资回报敏感的STEPN的用户去仿盘尝试赚钱，但终究仿盘们会die down，会让这些人受伤后、带着运动的习惯，重新回归到经过时间证明的、yield较低但稳定的STEPN；而这只是财务投资回报敏感的用户，那么更偏重utility投资回报的用户是不太愿意花如此多精力时间冒仿盘的险，而这也是STEPN用户和Axie用户的最大区别 - Axie的公会玩家可是需要用这笔钱过日子的，怎么能不用最大努力来最大化回报？再加上STEPN后面的社交属性和其他叙事 (narrative)、以及依靠自己最大体量发育起来旁氏经济之外的资源和资金流入能力（比如电商、碳排放、品牌合作等）以及创始人们的叙事 (narrative) 能力、用户的真实度和高质量，我相信STEPN或许可以成为一个比Axie更能站到最后的品牌。\n\n**总结**\n\n虽然死亡螺旋对Ponzinomics来说不可避免，但我写这篇文章的目的是想说明以下几点：\n\n1. 首先死亡螺旋的结果不是死亡，更不代表产品的失败，而是从X2E的疯狂回归至产品本身的公允价值的过程，而这个过程发生前的潜伏期有长有短，发生时的下降速度有快有慢，发生后回归到的公允价值有高有低。\n   * Axie作为第一个火的XXX赚钱项目 (或者叫X2E) 经历了很多trial and error，为后面的产品展示出了X2E的可能性、局限性、以及长时间运营下会遇到的挑战，从而让我们看到了如STEPN这样的项目在学习过程中取其精华努力创新 - X2E正在进化。\n   * 而我们期待的**X2E的进化，正是更克制的疯狂期、更慢速的退烧期，更高的公允价值回归线**- 这也是我认为STEPN有潜力做到的。\n   * 在这之外更重要的是能够最终做到，**让认可项目公允价值本身的用户变为主流，使utility价值投资者而非投机者获取大部分收益。（认可参与这样的项目不是简单的投10块赚20块，而是投10块不光值了项目本身带来utility的价值，还额外返还了3块；并且对于坚持下去的用户额外奖励，可以达到10块甚至20块返还的可能性。）**\n   * 未来的故事中Ponzinomics之外的经济来源是我对X2E很期待的地方，因为比当前链游的P2E更有故事和空间：比如最近我刚聊到一个Bike to Earn的项目（MOTE by Sweetgum Labs，有兴趣的投资人欢迎一起交流）提到了碳排放变现回流经济，那么举个例子的话，一个本来每天开车往返10公里上班的人改为每天骑车，一年可以省下4吨的碳排放，而一吨碳排放在欧洲当前可以价值80欧元，就意味着**一个人一年可以变现300多欧元来回流到经济系统**，而将来碳价的提升会让此机制更增加潜力。虽然肯定会有很多操作和价格上的挑战，但X2E产品在向外部经济回流这个方向努力，是我非常期待看到的。\n\n**写在最后**\n\n说了这么多我认为STEPN比Axie具有优势的地方，再强调一遍这并非投资建议，因为项目的运营除了基本面以外，很大程度上取决于掌权者和大户参与者 - STEPN能第一时间让三大交易所合作，以及whale拉盘时的慷慨都展示了很多STEPN在基本面之外的一些实力。最终STEPN的发展方向终归还是取决于项目里各种重要要素之间的利弊平衡以及动荡不安的市场。以上的分析是基于目前得到的各方面信息推测STEPN后面可能经历的一些节点和潜力，最终如何，就让我们拭目以待。", "timestamp": 1658289031, "digest": "uj_1WXmgWFHmyTGMOW1WgmFB_249TfKxG8DzKQGUWtU", "contributor": "0xa1923FB3ff4e7ed8766EC98E61Ac979F59009aFc"}

To be precise, snow is a unique sight in the Northland in winter.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kIW8P9VHJJ-yW3jJtJpV_.png?height=266&width=448)\n\nThe snow in the northern country comes very early, and sometimes the snow can't wait to come as soon as the footsteps of autumn are firm. The snow at this time is generally very small and sporadic. Although people have not enjoyed the joy of the autumn harvest, they will not be annoyed by the snow that arrives early. After all, the northerners love snow.\n\nThe posture of the snowflakes flying is admirable. You see, the snowflakes are dancing gracefully in the air. The light dance is so graceful and unrestrained, who would not say it is beautiful. When the snow falls for a few hours, the little snowflakes are like stars in the sky. It is best to float such snow at night. Looking at the snow under the street lights from a distance, you will be amazed at how there is such a spectacular meteor shower. When the snow is heavy, people like it even more. The fluttering snowflakes are like white lotus petals and goose feathers. Some people compare it to a jade butterfly. The dancing posture is really similar. Some people likened it to white plum blossoms, \"Snow is like plum blossoms, and plum blossoms are like snow. It's amazing whether it looks like it or not.\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vqle_1cjJwtj-J5qrVK1x.png?height=266&width=473)\n\nThe most beautiful moment under the snow is still in the spring and March. The spring in the northern country is like a shy little girl. It is always late. There are no flowers and no grass. \"Bai Xue thinks that the spring is late, so it wears the trees to make flying flowers.\" In the spring, the snow is generally heavy, and in an instant, everywhere is bright white, and the dead branches are suddenly decorated by snowflakes into trees full of white flowers. Just as the poem describes, \"Suddenly the spring breeze comes in one night, thousands of trees and pears bloom.\" Children also love the snow at this time. The snow in spring is soft, snowmen are easy to form, and snowballs will roll very well. very big. The weather at this time is also much warmer than the winter, and it will be more enjoyable to play than the winter when you can't reach out. Those who like photography will not let go of this gratifying snow scene at this time, focus on each beautiful picture, and carve it into eternity.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/77fUjUyOayAYxbgmYeKYr.png?height=266&width=474)\n\nI not only like the dance of snowflakes, but also its color.

NFTGo.io는 고래가 민팅 활동을 일으킨 컬렉션의 수를 알려준다. 이를 통해 그들의 새로운 NFT가 시장 전반에 걸쳐 얼마나 다양한지를 쉽게 발견할 수 있다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3Nb4orF5nU9Kphgm4FR21.png?height=490&width=2038)\n\n지난 24시간 동안, 해당 주소는 가장 다양한 주조 포트폴리오를 가지고 있었다. 그들은 5개의 컬렉션에 걸쳐 49개의 NFT를 민팅하기 위해 총 5.45 ETH 가스를 사용했다.\n\n민팅 볼륨 \\[형식 누락된 것으로 예상됨\\]\n\n볼륨은 민팅 옵션을 분석할 때 고려해야 할 중요한 지표다. 고래가 민팅 목적으로 지출한 ETH의 총량을 수집하여 시장 역사상 가장 많은 금액과 비교한다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T0_V6BdpilzgtPRDfm7xJ.png?height=490&width=1654)\n\n지난 달 동안 해당 주소는 74개의 NFT를 구매했으며 그 금액은 300ETH($992.5)를 초과했다.\n\n### 토탈 가스⛽\n\n고래 또한 기름값이 잔인하다는 것을 알고 있다. 그들은 가스 전쟁에서 이기기 위해 기꺼이 더 많은 가스 요금을 지불하고 정말 원한다면 NFT를 민팅한다. 이는 고래에게 NFT를 홀드하는 것이 얼마나 중요한지를 보여준다. 여기서 첫 번째 주소가 15 ETH 이상의 가스 요금을 지불했으며 실제 NFT에 4 ETH만 지출한 것을 볼 수 있다. 대조적으로, 2위는 거의 3배 더 많이 소비했다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pnD0xHBs742jg7k3JJtNU.png?height=378&width=1588)\n\n### 라스트 민트 및 민트\n\n마지막 두 열은 최근 민팅 활동과 선택한 기간 동안 민팅한 NFT 수에 대한 자세한 정보를 제공한다.\n\n## 어떻게 하면 성공할 수 있는가?\n\n전략적으로 민팅 활동에 대한 결정을 내리는 것은 막대한 수익을 창출할 수 있다. 오늘날 우리가 알고 있는 모든 NFT는 처음에는 만탕을 위한 새로운 NFT 컬렉션에 불과했다. 크립토펑크 같은 것들 중 일부는 민팅이 자유롭다.

Aptos公链生态建设** \n\n5\\.01 野心勃勃的计划：在过去几个月里，Aptos 与数百名开发商、品牌和公司进行了沟通，这些机构计划在 Aptos 上构建下一代社交媒体平台、NFT 、Web3 游戏、媒体和娱乐业务、支付、DeFi 集成的金融科技产品等。\n\n5\\.02 在Aptosde 社区中已有很多著名的公司，如 Anchorage、Binance、Blockorus、Coinbase、Livepeer、Moonclave、Paxos、Paymagic、Rarible 和 Streaming Fast，这些公司的开发人员已经在 Devnet（开发者测试网）上提供反馈和贡献代码.\n\n5\\.03 Pontem：部署在Aptos上的第一个DEX（去中心化交易所），使用Move语言开发，目前已有将近5万的独立用户.\n\n**6.路线图规划**\n\n* 2022年第一季度（3月15日）—开发者测试网启动（已完成）\n* 2022年第二季度——激励性的测试网启动（已接近尾声）\n* 2022年第三季度 - 主网启动（待启动）\n* 2022年Q4-2023年Q1 - 在Aptos主网部署下一个主要版本\n\n**7. 不可能三角-去中心化、安全性、速度**\n\n7\\.01 目前整个公链的发展都受到不可能三角的限制，各类区块链模型无论采用哪种共识机制来决定新区块的生成方式，都难以同时兼顾去中心化、安全、速度这3项要求，只能三者取其二。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CKie22W6uHN6hzewPD8fZ.png?height=636&width=900)\n\n7\\.02 Aptos在目前的测试网上有100个验证结点，相较于ETH的将近6000个验证结点，去中心化程度不够，但呼应官方一直宣传的安全性和高速度，去中心化程度不够也是理所当然\n\n**8.面临诉讼**\n\nAptos创始人Mo Shaikh目前面临Glazer家族成员Shari Glazer 10亿美元的诉讼，指控Shaikh 违反协议，阳奉阴违寻求风险投资，秘密成立新的公司（Matonee Inc.）并且通过欺诈性行为剥夺了Glazer在Venture中的合法所有权，要求其做出相应赔偿，若诉讼案成立则会对Aptos的前程蒙上一层阴影。\n\n**9.总结**\n\nAptos具备区块链从业经验丰富的创始团队，作为a16z、Binance等多家顶级VC看好的L1公链项目，同时Aptos的发展前景看起来无疑是一片光明，但由于目前尚处于测试网阶段，主网上线后表现如何还需进一步观察，同时还面临着诉讼的风险，这也对Aptos的发展埋下了隐患。", "timestamp": 1658291170, "digest": "_jyolmzDH4RlZzZQUBojPVv7uD_2Kc4nqZeFXYP3ir4", "contributor": "0x56C2dCE36fb699B9bE13CC2cb7DcaDc8cFCf479B"}

(A newer trailer released on June 2 has already been viewed more than 1.7 million times on PlayStation’s YouTube account.) \n\nAnd now the long awaited “cat game” is here — and players and their feline friends are already obsessed. \n\nSome mild spoilers follow: The gist of the game is that you play a lost, stray cat navigating a subterranean city populated by robots. The goal is to get back to the surface world, where your feline friends live. Your stray soon teams up with a sentient drone named B12 (who can talk to the humanoid robots for your cat character), and the two of you explore the city and solve puzzles to find your way home, discovering what happened to all of the humans along the way — while also avoiding hungry monsters who want to eat this cute kitty up almost as much as the players do. \n\n“Stray” was trending on Twitter on both Monday and Tuesday, around the game’s launch, drawing more than 363,000 tweets by late Tuesday afternoon.

Nine proposers requested \\~4.1m $OP tokens worth \\~$3.1m USD at time of drafting this post\n* As an Optimism delegate, I voted **FOR** four proposals and **AGAINST** five. For this round of proposals, I’ve beta tested a scorecard methodology to evaluating proposals (explained within this post)\n* Although not relevant to the Governance Fund, I want to support the Optimism ecosystem due to what I perceive to be a sound “one commandment” commitment to Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF)\n\nOptimism governance voting takes place on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth), governance overview information is organized on [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/overview), and proposal submission and feedback takes place on [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/).\n\nIf I got anything wrong or for anyone who would like to collaborate to improve or influence my governance approach as an Optimism delegate, reply to this companion [TWEET](https://twitter.com/rasmuky/status/1549412642607038464?s=20&t=NjMvOFJ4ZkkPsxZsr3qhZg).\n\n\n---\n\n## Optimism token and governance fund overview\n\n### Why Optimism for me\n\nMy current favored L1 nation is Ethereum and I’m in the process of making Optimism my L2 neighborhood. I am drawn to the Optimism commitment to maximize [Retroactive Public Goods Funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) (RPGF). If Optimism is able to maximize “good” MEV capture and remain economically and technically competitive to other chains, I think that would be a great outcome for the network and ecosystem writ large and create public goods for the masses. Providing economic incentives to build public goods should support mass adoption and long-term use of the ecosystem.\n\nI plan to spend more time with Arbirtrum, Polygon, and the zero knowledge L2’s coming online soon, but Optimism appears to be committed to a “[one commandment](https://thenetworkstate.com/the-one-commandment)” (a la the [Network State](https://thenetworkstate.com/preamble)) focus on RPFG. I like RPGF as a single commandment.\n\nI also plan to dive deeper into Cosmos and it’s app chain / IPFS ecosystem at a future date as it sounds like there are a lot of interesting possibilities with that architecture as well.\n\n### The Optimism token allocation\n\nThe Optimism token dropped end of April 2022 and is broken down as follows:\n\n![https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/#](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w7CP_dEbs1bNmloFWnfvy.jpeg?height=1440&width=2880&&&size=medium)\n\nFor the purposes of this post, I’ll focus on the Governance Fund (GF, 5.4% slice) under the Ecosystem Fund (25% slice) above. Live proposals on Boardroom and Discourse all relate to phase one, which ends in two days (Jul 20, 2022).\n\n## Governance fund phase 1 overview\n\n### General guidance\n\nThere is a good overview of the GF and more specifically Phase 1 [HERE](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/gov-fund/). The highlights are:\n\n* Any project launched on Optimism is eligible to submit a proposal\n* Proposals must include a plan for how the tokens will incentivize growth on Optimism\n* Although not a strict requirement, the Optimism Foundation recommends that each project submitting a Governance Fund proposal include a commitment to match OP token incentives with their own project incentives\n* Proposals are reviewed and approved by the Token House (OP holders, or their delegates)\n* When a project gets a proposal approved, they are still eligible to apply for further proposals\n  * Recommendation is that projects distribute their initial allocation of tokens before requesting further tokens\n  * Projects are also encouraged to reference data from the success of their initial distribution to strengthen their case in future proposals\n\n### Amount of tokens requested by proposers\n\nBelow are two tables I created to frame the magnitude of the nine proposals in relation to the total governance fund:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tf1o1GXn8GjiNdH3VEKgC.png?height=2880&width=5760&size=medium)\n\nAssuming I’ve interpreted the various governance docs correctly, phase 1 proposals currently up for vote (cycle 3) represent 1.7% of the total GF (for a total of \\~$3.1m USD at time of drafting on Jul 18th, 2022). Assuming Phase 0 was fully allocated to the cap, there is still 65.2% of the GF to allocate in future phase 1 cycles.\n\n### Overview of delegators and the token house\n\nThe token house is comprised of all $OP token delegates. Holders of $OP = delegates if the holder agrees to the responsibility of acting as a delegate and participating in governance. If a holder of $OP chooses to not participate in governance, that holder may delegate their tokens to a proxy delegate. I have self delegated and plan to participate in governance going forward.\n\nHere is an overview of how the token house fits into the broad Optimism governance structure, for reference:\n\n![https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G1U4xGL_l3jcVPitYDizm.jpeg?height=822&width=1216)\n\n## Rasmuky’s proposal evaluation scorecard approach\n\n### Scorecard overview\n\nIn an attempt to evaluate proposals in a consistent way and in line with guidance provided by the Optimism core team, I developed a basic scorecard:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fPSu_ty1wSBs-7HfP3P2m.png?height=284&width=444)\n\nI’ll iterate on the approach for future processes, but conceptually:\n\n* Factors developed based on guidance from Optimism Collective, reading through comments on Discourse from other delegates, and considering factors that matter to me personally or that I feel are positive for the network\n* Weights were subjectively developed and will be reevaluated for future phases or future proposals\n* I plan to rank each factor on a 0-10 scale, with a **hurdle of 5.0** for a **FOR** vote.\n* For parameters which appear more binary (i.e., project on Optimism)\n  * No will render as 0\n  * Yes as 5 so as to not negatively impact hurdle score of 5.0\n  * If it’s obvious the project is heavily invested in Optimism, can scale up from 5 to as high as 10\n* The respective weights will be applied to the 0-10 score and then aggregated to produce a weighted score\n\nAll of this is very subjective, but this approach is likely less subjective than just saying “I like the project, yes vote from me.”\n\n### Expected evolution of scorecard process\n\nI only recently began to immerse in the Optimism governance process, so this scorecard and broad approach will be refined for future phases or proposal cohorts. Ideally, I would have spent more time engaging on Discourse with the proposers for this tranche, but alas.\n\nWith more time to research and engage more with proposers, I would likely include other factors like protocol decentralization, open source codebase, chain of custody of digital assets, approach / emphasis on security, evaluation of grant size request relative to other historical proposals, robust assessment / diligence of on chain metrics (across all chains), etc.\n\nThe diligence of on chain metrics is factor and value add to the Optimistic Collective I’m most excited about. I believe I could provide an objective analysis of proposer protocol use and growth which all Optimism delegates could use for their proposal evaluation process. Data and analytics diligence is what I currently do in Web2, so I’m very comfortable objectively analyzing data, engaging with management teams to stress test my interpretations, and then packaging outputs for intuitive interpretation by a wide range of user profiles.\n\nIf other delegates choose to deploy a scorecard style approach, ideally delegates would decide the parameters that are most important to them, develop their own weights, etc. A diverse set of approaches to governance is healthy, this is simply the approach I chose for this round.\n\n## Overview of phase 1 proposal evaluations\n\nAs I was late to the party for this round of proposals, I’ll be brief. Also, at snapshot I only held 1.6k $OP tokens and had none delegated to me, so no vote I cast will move the needle on proposals in this round.\n\nI expect to increase my future phase vote impact (i) as I accumulate my own $OP stake and (ii) by earning $OP token holders support as a prudent and thoughtful delegate. [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rasmuky) if you would like to discuss delegating to me.\n\n### Proposal A | Superfluid\n\n[Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/home) is a protocol which enables payment streaming (e.g., high frequency settlement, like salary payments every day). I voted **FOR** for this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IiGpH0RR2DRXSQIoARcp_.png?height=282&width=550)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Plan for how tokens will incentivize growth (+)** - Products like Superfluid tend to be very sticky once organizations / people begin to program payments or streams. I’m not sure of the adoption or competitor set, but relative to more mercenary capital / temporary use cases, I think there is more potential for long-term Optimism adoption and growth with Superfliud\n* **Transparency of proposer to end recipient (+/-)** - A portion of $OP tokens will be utilized to subsidize fees to set up and execute streams, which should be pretty easy to observe and directly benefit Optimism. A separate portion will be allocated to developers to support migration of treasuries and other activities to Optimism. It would be very challenging to validate or verify that use of GF grant is to the benefit of the Optimism network in the case of developer compensation (the developer could have been working on a different chain)\n* **Money on chain / alternative to TradFi (+)** - I’m a big believer that creating boring use cases to lure retail users away from TradFi banks and get them on chain will drive adoption. I don’t think I’ve ever met someone who genuinely likes their retail bank, huge opportunity. Creating set it and forget it programmed payments and receipts platform which would improve money fluidity and access is in line with this concept\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHg2MjVlNzBkY2ZmMzViZTA0Mjc3ODY4NGQ2NmNiM2UyNGVmZDM1YmRjNDIyMmQyNjMwNDdhZmQyNjk5MTg4ZmI2) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-superfluid/2314).\n\n### Proposal B | Kromatika\n\n[Kromatika](https://kromatika.finance/) is a swap DEX with an optimized approach to limit orders. I voted **FOR** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o61ULQ_SoS1ZYLp30yKNO.png?height=283&width=551)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Growth on Optimism** - I do think that limit orders are a relatively basic building block of finance and markets. I haven’t used the product (I will soon), but if the platform works well I can see it being a sticky protocol\n* **Rewards / incentives transparency (+/-)** - Marketing and especially influencer marketing tends to carry a negative connotation in Web3, but I think it is important and leveraging high quality educational influencer material is a good choice. While the ecosystem is very small, organic growth based on word of mouth is achievable. As the ecosystem continues to grow, I think fluency in marketing will be very important. However, I don’t have a clear view of how influencer marketing spend or early user drops will be traced into actions on Optimism\n* **Money on chain alternative to TradFi** - As mentioned, limit orders is a relatively basic use case so I suspect many retail users would benefit from Kromatika. If I thought more average retail TradFi users were actively trading with limit orders this factor would have carried more weight\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHgwMzdlNDE0OGNmOGZlYjcwNmMwMjMxMDhlMWM4MmY5ZDc2NWE2YzYyMTdkY2VmOWFlMzY3YTY3MjY4MzgyMGU5) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-kromatika/2650/11).\n\n### Proposal C | Hundred Finance\n\n[Hundred Finance](https://hundred.finance/) is a lend borrow protocol for DeFi. I voted **FOR** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yJqqJf8EbN26c4jTp6hA0.png?height=283&width=550)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Growth on Optimism (-)** - Incentives appear to be majority based on yield farming emissions which generally attracts mercenary capital\n* **Proposer funded incentives (+)** - Proposer committed to substantial co-incentives to generate attractive yields for users. Ranges provided where quite wide, so some refinement or monitoring of co-incentives would be a good check\n* **New to Optimism (+)** - Slight positive based on cross chain lend / borrow activity as that sounds like a unique product to me. Unclear how that may impact activity on chain (is cross chain positive for Optimism or not?), but sounds interesting to test\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHhlM2Y0NzEzY2ExZGNmZThlOWUzZTNmNTk1NjBlMjg4OTVhODg5NWI1NTljYzFmMjMzMWNhNDAxY2U1MTEyNWY0) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-hundred-finance/2733).\n\n### Proposal D | Biconomy\n\n[Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.com/) appears to be a diversified Web3 / Crypto exchange and dApp creator. The proposal appears to center around [Hyphen](https://www.biconomy.io/hyphen-page) (bridge protocol) and [Gasless](https://www.biconomy.io/gasless-page) (partner protocol test subsidizer).  I voted **FOR** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3dQoYtC9RqWDnQLulvIdS.png?height=283&width=550)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Growth on Optimism (+)** - Liquidity incentives to support bridging to Optimism and gasless incentives to incentivize testing of dApps on Optimism has potential to be a tailwind for growth. Also, the fact that the Biconomy is open to collaborating with the token house to select worthy dApps is a good gesture as well\n* **Proposer match (+/-)** - Score is simply the match ratio as stipulated by the proposer\n* **New product / demand need (+)** - The Gasless product is very versatile in that it can incent users to migrate to Optimism to utilize a wide variety of dApps, presumably many of which would be new to the Optimism network\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHgyYTgzZDA0OTA1NDI4NWNjN2JiOWM4OTU5OWQ0NjkwNDViNzZkMjlkN2FjZTk5MjhhYjJiMDViZDAxYTcyYWVk) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-biconomy/2880).\n\n### Proposal E | Dope Wars\n\n[Dope Wars](https://dopewars.gg/) is an MMO (massively multiplayer online) game in line with Grand Theft Auto. This is not an area of the ecosystem which I’m fluent in, though Dope Wars presents as committed to making Optimism it’s home base. I voted **AGAINST**, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-mC5bzOopZ-n_L0hTPtjD.png?height=283&width=550)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **New product / additional demand (+)** - Blockchain gaming is not prevalent on Optimism to my knowledge, but can definitely drive a lot of volume if the respective game achieves solid traction\n* **incentives / rewards transparency (-)** - A portion of the incentives are slated to go into the project treasury, which is likely to be very opaque and hard to correlate to growth on Optimism\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHhhNDk3YWYxMWFiMzFlNjM4ZDM4YmNmNmQ1NzY4OWE1NzI5YmY2NmVlMWMzZmQ4OWYyMGJjZDdkOWU2ZmE2ZDRi) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722).\n\n### Proposal F | Infinity Wallet\n\n[Infinity Wallet](https://infinitywallet.io/) is a multi-chain desktop focused crypto wallet with robust native integrations with various dApps. I voted **AGAINST** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S0NPKuOZW6k-_vGXgBf9R.png?height=282&width=550)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Growth on Optimism (+)** - A dApp native integration approach could be very sticky if the UI / UX is positive. I have not used the product, but do see value in the concept\n* **New product (-)** - There are multiple wallets operational on Optimism. The native dApp integration sounds interesting, but I’m underwhelmed about the braggadocio of being desktop focused. Humans are mobile\n* **Incentives / rewards transparency (-)** - 80% of the incentives / rewards are earmarked for developers, which is generally great. Validating what developers are working on is no easy task, so I suspect confidence of prudent spend would be challenging to verify or get comfortable with\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHgxY2I1NWI3ZGFjYTM4YTM3ZGZkMjUwNzIxODMyOWZiNWQ3OTEyYWM1YjIzNzg1OWM1NDdkY2VhMDExNTIzMWQ3) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-cycle-3-proposal-infinity-wallet/2713/95).\n\n### Proposal G | Dexguru\n\n[DexGuru](https://dex.guru/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2-eth) is a crypto trading platform. I voted **AGAINST** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_px_1f_6ElI4V_YfP040y.png?height=283&width=551)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Growth on Optimism and incentives transparency (-)** - Incentives primarily go to developer resources in the DexGuru DAO. Understanding how those incentives translate into time and attention on developing the Optimism ecosystem would be a challenge in my opinion\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHgzYzU2MDM1MjJkNmE5NTdiMjQ0NWY2OTBmNjk1MjI5MGQ1Y2MwZWZiMGEyOGViM2UxZjQ0YWY1OTliYTk2OTNm) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dexguru/2536).\n\n### Proposal H | Overnight.fi\n\n[Overnight.Fi](https://overnight.fi/) is the creator of USD+, a high yield rebasing token backed with USDC. I voted **AGAINST** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/71o4zcSOxXBhYnJDglgs6.png?height=282&width=550)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Growth on Optimism (-)** - Proposal plan is to provide incentives to increase LP liquidity / yield farming, which tends to attract mercenary capital. I think the long-term growth on Optimism from these types of strategies is uncertain at best\n* **Proposer incentives - USD+ (-)** -  Produces yield as a result of yield farming strategies, but the proposer team has not matched incentives to further drive growth on Optimism\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHhiMzIxYTBjYjE5MTQ3YTc1Y2NjYTQxZDQ4MjU5NGQ3ODU2NzNiNzY3NTkzYTBkMjU5NjRjN2VjOWEzMzU4MTI4) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-overnight-fi/2816).\n\n### Proposal I | Saddle Finance\n\n[Saddle Finance](https://saddle.finance/#/) is a token swap platform focused on stable coin liquidity and which caters to traders and LP pools. I voted **AGAINST** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2Hvf-T2CxcFeL_mUJw1Zm.png?height=283&width=551)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Incentivization of growth of Optimism (-)** - The incentives are largely liquidity mining incentives, which typically are more mercenary in nature. It sounds unlikely these incentives would result in meaningful long-term growth for the Optimism ecosystem\n* **Rewards transparency (+)** - Although the stickiness of the rewards are uncertain, transparency as to use of funds should be clear if visible on chain via yield farming\n* **Forum engagement (-)** - It’s hard to conclude in many cases with no background knowledge, but my general thought is that when an organization is asking for a grant they should go out of their way to to be as cordial, productive, and positive as possible in the discourse. Everyone absolutely deserves the right to defend themselves and their organization, but reiterating data driven positive elements of their proposal and staying on topic is what I look for from a proposal team\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHgzNmNkZjI4MGZlOGMzNzYwNTYxZTc2ZDU3YTllNzAyMmNiMzgzZTc4OWNlODBiNzBlZDc5MWM2YTY4MTY2YWZi) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-saddle-finance/2842).\n\n## Outro\n\nThere are definitely some protocols / projects which appear to be value accretive to Optimism in this Governance Fund cohort. I look forward to engaging with the next cohort of proposals in cycle 4 and refining my evaluation approach.\n\nLet me know what you think I got wrong in this companion [TWEET](https://twitter.com/rasmuky/status/1549412642607038464?s=20&t=NjMvOFJ4ZkkPsxZsr3qhZg)! I want this approach well oiled to do my part to contribute to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\n\n---\n\nAbout rasmuky:\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0xdb92c5C91a5D81Bd9865a07A42c7dD3F35bDA225/lnFQ5wj4FfNKK0wcyOYt974y-9lnaD3M-iUAqS1bRe4](https://mirror.xyz/0xdb92c5C91a5D81Bd9865a07A42c7dD3F35bDA225/lnFQ5wj4FfNKK0wcyOYt974y-9lnaD3M-iUAqS1bRe4)\n\n[https://twitter.com/rasmuky](https://twitter.com/rasmuky)\n\n[https://linktr.ee/rasmuky](https://linktr.ee/rasmuky)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658291027, "digest": "Q7Co1q9q48yrP2SWByZ2Yyitnb1M_mjHKudjm9ViaQc", "contributor": "0xdb92c5C91a5D81Bd9865a07A42c7dD3F35bDA225"}

Nine proposers requested \\~4.1m $OP tokens worth \\~$3.1m USD at time of drafting this post\n* As an Optimism delegate, I voted **FOR** four proposals and **AGAINST** five. For this round of proposals, I’ve beta tested a scorecard methodology to evaluating proposals (explained within this post)\n* Although not relevant to the Governance Fund, I want to support the Optimism ecosystem due to what I perceive to be a sound “one commandment” commitment to Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF)\n\nOptimism governance voting takes place on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth), governance overview information is organized on [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/overview), and proposal submission and feedback takes place on [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/).\n\nIf I got anything wrong or for anyone who would like to collaborate to improve or influence my governance approach as an Optimism delegate, reply to this companion [TWEET](https://twitter.com/rasmuky/status/1549412642607038464?s=20&t=NjMvOFJ4ZkkPsxZsr3qhZg).\n\n\n---\n\n## Optimism token and governance fund overview\n\n### Why Optimism for me\n\nMy current favored L1 nation is Ethereum and I’m in the process of making Optimism my L2 neighborhood. I am drawn to the Optimism commitment to maximize [Retroactive Public Goods Funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) (RPGF). If Optimism is able to maximize “good” MEV capture and remain economically and technically competitive to other chains, I think that would be a great outcome for the network and ecosystem writ large and create public goods for the masses. Providing economic incentives to build public goods should support mass adoption and long-term use of the ecosystem.\n\nI plan to spend more time with Arbirtrum, Polygon, and the zero knowledge L2’s coming online soon, but Optimism appears to be committed to a “[one commandment](https://thenetworkstate.com/the-one-commandment)” (a la the [Network State](https://thenetworkstate.com/preamble)) focus on RPFG. I like RPGF as a single commandment.\n\nI also plan to dive deeper into Cosmos and it’s app chain / IPFS ecosystem at a future date as it sounds like there are a lot of interesting possibilities with that architecture as well.\n\n### The Optimism token allocation\n\nThe Optimism token dropped end of April 2022 and is broken down as follows:\n\n![https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/#](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w7CP_dEbs1bNmloFWnfvy.jpeg?height=1440&width=2880&&&size=medium)\n\nFor the purposes of this post, I’ll focus on the Governance Fund (GF, 5.4% slice) under the Ecosystem Fund (25% slice) above. Live proposals on Boardroom and Discourse all relate to phase one, which ends in two days (Jul 20, 2022).\n\n## Governance fund phase 1 overview\n\n### General guidance\n\nThere is a good overview of the GF and more specifically Phase 1 [HERE](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/gov-fund/). The highlights are:\n\n* Any project launched on Optimism is eligible to submit a proposal\n* Proposals must include a plan for how the tokens will incentivize growth on Optimism\n* Although not a strict requirement, the Optimism Foundation recommends that each project submitting a Governance Fund proposal include a commitment to match OP token incentives with their own project incentives\n* Proposals are reviewed and approved by the Token House (OP holders, or their delegates)\n* When a project gets a proposal approved, they are still eligible to apply for further proposals\n  * Recommendation is that projects distribute their initial allocation of tokens before requesting further tokens\n  * Projects are also encouraged to reference data from the success of their initial distribution to strengthen their case in future proposals\n\n### Amount of tokens requested by proposers\n\nBelow are two tables I created to frame the magnitude of the nine proposals in relation to the total governance fund:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tf1o1GXn8GjiNdH3VEKgC.png?height=2880&width=5760&size=medium)\n\nAssuming I’ve interpreted the various governance docs correctly, phase 1 proposals up for vote represent 1.7% of the total GF (for a total of \\~$3.1m USD at time of drafting on Jul 18th, 2022). Assuming Phase 0 was fully allocated to the cap, there is still 65.2% of the GF to allocate in future phase 1 cycles.\n\n### Overview of delegators and the token house\n\nThe token house is comprised of all $OP token delegates. Holders of $OP = delegates if the holder agrees to the responsibility of acting as a delegate and participating in governance. If a holder of $OP chooses to not participate in governance, that holder may delegate their tokens to a proxy delegate. I have self delegated and plan to participate in governance going forward.\n\nHere is an overview of how the token house fits into the broad Optimism governance structure, for reference:\n\n![https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G1U4xGL_l3jcVPitYDizm.jpeg?height=822&width=1216)\n\n## Rasmuky’s proposal evaluation scorecard approach\n\n### Scorecard overview\n\nIn an attempt to evaluate proposals in a consistent way and in line with guidance provided by the Optimism core team, I developed a basic scorecard:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fPSu_ty1wSBs-7HfP3P2m.png?height=284&width=444)\n\nI’ll iterate on the approach for future processes, but conceptually:\n\n* Factors developed based on guidance from Optimism Collective, reading through comments on Discourse from other delegates, and considering factors that matter to me personally or that I feel are positive for the network\n* Weights were subjectively developed and will be reevaluated for future phases or future proposals\n* I plan to rank each factor on a 0-10 scale, with a **hurdle of 5.0** for a **FOR** vote.\n* For parameters which appear more binary (i.e., project on Optimism)\n  * No will render as 0\n  * Yes as 5 so as to not negatively impact hurdle score of 5.0\n  * If it’s obvious the project is heavily invested in Optimism, can scale up from 5 to as high as 10\n* The respective weights will be applied to the 0-10 score and then aggregated to produce a weighted score\n\nAll of this is very subjective, but this approach is likely less subjective than just saying “I like the project, yes vote from me.”\n\n### Expected evolution of scorecard process\n\nI only recently began to immerse in the Optimism governance process, so this scorecard and broad approach will be refined for future phases or proposal cohorts. Ideally, I would have spent more time engaging on Discourse with the proposers for this tranche, but alas.\n\nWith more time to research and engage more with proposers, I would likely include other factors like protocol decentralization, open source codebase, chain of custody of digital assets, approach / emphasis on security, evaluation of grant size request relative to other historical proposals, robust assessment / diligence of on chain metrics (across all chains), etc.\n\nThe diligence of on chain metrics is factor and value add to the Optimistic Collective I’m most excited about. I believe I could provide an objective analysis of proposer protocol use and growth which all Optimism delegates could use for their proposal evaluation process. Data and analytics diligence is what I currently do in Web2, so I’m very comfortable objectively analyzing data, engaging with management teams to stress test my interpretations, and then packaging outputs for intuitive interpretation by a wide range of user profiles.\n\nIf other delegates choose to deploy a scorecard style approach, ideally delegates would decide the parameters that are most important to them, develop their own weights, etc. A diverse set of approaches to governance is healthy, this is simply the approach I chose for this round.\n\n## Overview of phase 1 proposal evaluations\n\nAs I was late to the party for this round of proposals, I’ll be brief. Also, at snapshot I only held 1.6k $OP tokens and had none delegated to me, so no vote I cast will move the needle on proposals in this round.\n\nI expect to increase my future phase vote impact (i) as I accumulate my own $OP stake and (ii) by earning $OP token holders support as a prudent and thoughtful delegate. [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rasmuky) if you would like to discuss delegating to me.\n\n### Proposal A | Superfluid\n\n[Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/home) is a protocol which enables payment streaming (e.g., high frequency settlement, like salary payments every day). I voted **FOR** for this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IiGpH0RR2DRXSQIoARcp_.png?height=282&width=550)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Plan for how tokens will incentivize growth (+)** - Products like Superfluid tend to be very sticky once organizations / people begin to program payments or streams. I’m not sure of the adoption or competitor set, but relative to more mercenary capital / temporary use cases, I think there is more potential for long-term Optimism adoption and growth with Superfliud\n* **Transparency of proposer to end recipient (+/-)** - A portion of $OP tokens will be utilized to subsidize fees to set up and execute streams, which should be pretty easy to observe and directly benefit Optimism. A separate portion will be allocated to developers to support migration of treasuries and other activities to Optimism. It would be very challenging to validate or verify that use of GF grant is to the benefit of the Optimism network in the case of developer compensation (the developer could have been working on a different chain)\n* **Money on chain / alternative to TradFi (+)** - I’m a big believer that creating boring use cases to lure retail users away from TradFi banks and get them on chain will drive adoption. I don’t think I’ve ever met someone who genuinely likes their retail bank, huge opportunity. Creating set it and forget it programmed payments and receipts platform which would improve money fluidity and access is in line with this concept\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHg2MjVlNzBkY2ZmMzViZTA0Mjc3ODY4NGQ2NmNiM2UyNGVmZDM1YmRjNDIyMmQyNjMwNDdhZmQyNjk5MTg4ZmI2) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-superfluid/2314).\n\n### Proposal B | Kromatika\n\n[Kromatika](https://kromatika.finance/) is a swap DEX with an optimized approach to limit orders. I voted **FOR** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o61ULQ_SoS1ZYLp30yKNO.png?height=283&width=551)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Growth on Optimism** - I do think that limit orders are a relatively basic building block of finance and markets. I haven’t used the product (I will soon), but if the platform works well I can see it being a sticky protocol\n* **Rewards / incentives transparency (+/-)** - Marketing and especially influencer marketing tends to carry a negative connotation in Web3, but I think it is important and leveraging high quality educational influencer material is a good choice. While the ecosystem is very small, organic growth based on word of mouth is achievable. As the ecosystem continues to grow, I think fluency in marketing will be very important. However, I don’t have a clear view of how influencer marketing spend or early user drops will be traced into actions on Optimism\n* **Money on chain alternative to TradFi** - As mentioned, limit orders is a relatively basic use case so I suspect many retail users would benefit from Kromatika. If I thought more average retail TradFi users were actively trading with limit orders this factor would have carried more weight\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHgwMzdlNDE0OGNmOGZlYjcwNmMwMjMxMDhlMWM4MmY5ZDc2NWE2YzYyMTdkY2VmOWFlMzY3YTY3MjY4MzgyMGU5) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-kromatika/2650/11).\n\n### Proposal C | Hundred Finance\n\n[Hundred Finance](https://hundred.finance/) is a lend borrow protocol for DeFi. I voted **FOR** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yJqqJf8EbN26c4jTp6hA0.png?height=283&width=550)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Growth on Optimism (-)** - Incentives appear to be majority based on yield farming emissions which generally attracts mercenary capital\n* **Proposer funded incentives (+)** - Proposer committed to substantial co-incentives to generate attractive yields for users. Ranges provided where quite wide, so some refinement or monitoring of co-incentives would be a good check\n* **New to Optimism (+)** - Slight positive based on cross chain lend / borrow activity as that sounds like a unique product to me. Unclear how that may impact activity on chain (is cross chain positive for Optimism or not?), but sounds interesting to test\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHhlM2Y0NzEzY2ExZGNmZThlOWUzZTNmNTk1NjBlMjg4OTVhODg5NWI1NTljYzFmMjMzMWNhNDAxY2U1MTEyNWY0) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-hundred-finance/2733).\n\n### Proposal D | Biconomy\n\n[Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.com/) appears to be a diversified Web3 / Crypto exchange and dApp creator. The proposal appears to center around [Hyphen](https://www.biconomy.io/hyphen-page) (bridge protocol) and [Gasless](https://www.biconomy.io/gasless-page) (partner protocol test subsidizer).  I voted **FOR** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3dQoYtC9RqWDnQLulvIdS.png?height=283&width=550)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Growth on Optimism (+)** - Liquidity incentives to support bridging to Optimism and gasless incentives to incentivize testing of dApps on Optimism has potential to be a tailwind for growth. Also, the fact that the Biconomy is open to collaborating with the token house to select worthy dApps is a good gesture as well\n* **Proposer match (+/-)** - Score is simply the match ratio as stipulated by the proposer\n* **New product / demand need (+)** - The Gasless product is very versatile in that it can incent users to migrate to Optimism to utilize a wide variety of dApps, presumably many of which would be new to the Optimism network\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHgyYTgzZDA0OTA1NDI4NWNjN2JiOWM4OTU5OWQ0NjkwNDViNzZkMjlkN2FjZTk5MjhhYjJiMDViZDAxYTcyYWVk) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-biconomy/2880).\n\n### Proposal E | Dope Wars\n\n[Dope Wars](https://dopewars.gg/) is an MMO (massively multiplayer online) game in line with Grand Theft Auto. This is not an area of the ecosystem which I’m fluent in, though Dope Wars presents as committed to making Optimism it’s home base. I voted **AGAINST**, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-mC5bzOopZ-n_L0hTPtjD.png?height=283&width=550)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **New product / additional demand (+)** - Blockchain gaming is not prevalent on Optimism to my knowledge, but can definitely drive a lot of volume if the respective game achieves solid traction\n* **incentives / rewards transparency (-)** - A portion of the incentives are slated to go into the project treasury, which is likely to be very opaque and hard to correlate to growth on Optimism\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHhhNDk3YWYxMWFiMzFlNjM4ZDM4YmNmNmQ1NzY4OWE1NzI5YmY2NmVlMWMzZmQ4OWYyMGJjZDdkOWU2ZmE2ZDRi) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722).\n\n### Proposal F | Infinity Wallet\n\n[Infinity Wallet](https://infinitywallet.io/) is a multi-chain desktop focused crypto wallet with robust native integrations with various dApps. I voted **AGAINST** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S0NPKuOZW6k-_vGXgBf9R.png?height=282&width=550)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Growth on Optimism (+)** - A dApp native integration approach could be very sticky if the UI / UX is positive. I have not used the product, but do see value in the concept\n* **New product (-)** - There are multiple wallets operational on Optimism. The native dApp integration sounds interesting, but I’m underwhelmed about the braggadocio of being desktop focused. Humans are mobile\n* **Incentives / rewards transparency (-)** - 80% of the incentives / rewards are earmarked for developers, which is generally great. Validating what developers are working on is no easy task, so I suspect confidence of prudent spend would be challenging to verify or get comfortable with\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHgxY2I1NWI3ZGFjYTM4YTM3ZGZkMjUwNzIxODMyOWZiNWQ3OTEyYWM1YjIzNzg1OWM1NDdkY2VhMDExNTIzMWQ3) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-cycle-3-proposal-infinity-wallet/2713/95).\n\n### Proposal G | Dexguru\n\n[DexGuru](https://dex.guru/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2-eth) is a crypto trading platform. I voted **AGAINST** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_px_1f_6ElI4V_YfP040y.png?height=283&width=551)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Growth on Optimism and incentives transparency (-)** - Incentives primarily go to developer resources in the DexGuru DAO. Understanding how those incentives translate into time and attention on developing the Optimism ecosystem would be a challenge in my opinion\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHgzYzU2MDM1MjJkNmE5NTdiMjQ0NWY2OTBmNjk1MjI5MGQ1Y2MwZWZiMGEyOGViM2UxZjQ0YWY1OTliYTk2OTNm) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-dexguru/2536).\n\n### Proposal H | Overnight.fi\n\n[Overnight.Fi](https://overnight.fi/) is the creator of USD+, a high yield rebasing token backed with USDC. I voted **AGAINST** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/71o4zcSOxXBhYnJDglgs6.png?height=282&width=550)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Growth on Optimism (-)** - Proposal plan is to provide incentives to increase LP liquidity / yield farming, which tends to attract mercenary capital. I think the long-term growth on Optimism from these types of strategies is uncertain at best\n* **Proposer incentives - USD+ (-)** -  Produces yield as a result of yield farming strategies, but the proposer team has not matched incentives to further drive growth on Optimism\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHhiMzIxYTBjYjE5MTQ3YTc1Y2NjYTQxZDQ4MjU5NGQ3ODU2NzNiNzY3NTkzYTBkMjU5NjRjN2VjOWEzMzU4MTI4) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-overnight-fi/2816).\n\n### Proposal I | Saddle Finance\n\n[Saddle Finance](https://saddle.finance/#/) is a token swap platform focused on stable coin liquidity and which caters to traders and LP pools. I voted **AGAINST** this proposal, scorecard output:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2Hvf-T2CxcFeL_mUJw1Zm.png?height=283&width=551)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Incentivization of growth of Optimism (-)** - The incentives are largely liquidity mining incentives, which typically are more mercenary in nature. It sounds unlikely these incentives would result in meaningful long-term growth for the Optimism ecosystem\n* **Rewards transparency (+)** - Although the stickiness of the rewards are uncertain, transparency as to use of funds should be clear if visible on chain via yield farming\n* **Forum engagement (-)** - It’s hard to conclude in many cases with no background knowledge, but my general thought is that when an organization is asking for a grant they should go out of their way to to be as cordial, productive, and positive as possible in the discourse. Everyone absolutely deserves the right to defend themselves and their organization, but reiterating data driven positive elements of their proposal and staying on topic is what I look for from a proposal team\n\nFor reference, [Boardroom.io](https://boardroom.io/optimism/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6b3B0aW1pc206c25hcHNob3Q6MHgzNmNkZjI4MGZlOGMzNzYwNTYxZTc2ZDU3YTllNzAyMmNiMzgzZTc4OWNlODBiNzBlZDc5MWM2YTY4MTY2YWZi) and [Discourse](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-saddle-finance/2842).\n\n## Outro\n\nThere are definitely some protocols / projects which appear to be value accretive to Optimism in this Governance Fund cohort. I look forward to engaging with the next cohort of proposals and refining my evaluation approach.\n\nLet me know what you think I got wrong in this companion [TWEET](https://twitter.com/rasmuky/status/1549412642607038464?s=20&t=NjMvOFJ4ZkkPsxZsr3qhZg)!

{"id": "Ola4a_EYGw6Ub6V6q54HyVj-5M8vV5By0ILZbnOqKaQ", "title": "WHAT IS A AIRDROP? ", "body": "# The Great Airdrop Debate\n\n## A New Airdrop Adventure\n\nAs I am embarking on another journey into unfamiliar territory, I am reflecting back on the best and the worst airdrops I have been a part of. The Arbitrum Odyssey just kicked off and it appears to be a super exciting event, spanning across eight weeks and multiple NFT airdrops. Will this be a successful series of airdrops? Will it meet the expectations of both the builders and users across this growing ecosystem? Honestly, I can not wait to find out; especially, because I have not explored Ethereum and its Layer 2 protocols and dApps. If you are interested in joining this Odyssey, I have left links in the Sources section below the article to get you started.\n\n## The Best Airdrop\n\nNot surprisingly, being an avid experimenter, I have participated in and received nearly a hundred airdrops. In the process, I have developed a short list of what qualifies as a successful token airdrop (fungible or non-fungible).\n\nHere it is:\n\n* the protocol or dApp has defined, communicated, and stood by the airdrop distribution criteria\n* the distribution supports the future value of the protocol\n* the airdrop is designed to avoid a “sell and dump” of the token event\n* upon releasing the airdrop, there exists functionality in the protocol or dApp\n* the airdrop recipient should be required to engage with the blockchain, protocol, or dApp.\n\nWhy am I proponent of having to work for your drop? Why not just distribute it wide and far? Because, those events make up my short list of the worst airdrops I have participated in.\n\n## The Worst Airdrop\n\nHere is that list of what I think makes for a forgettable airdrop event:\n\n* the airdrop criteria are poorly communicated\n* the airdrop criteria are changed, after the announcement communication has been released\n* the airdrop comes with a bribe that negatively affects another team of builders or group of users\n* the airdropped tokens are released all at once\n* the protocol or dApp airdrop functionality does not work or crashes\n* congestion and transaction delays lead to frustration\n* drops using whitelists (borrowing from today’s Wordle, that is simply an “awful” name, which exemplifies misplaced exclusivity)\n* there is no utility in the protocol or dApp when the airdrop is released.\n* the airdrop comes with a staking requirement; yet, there is no introduction of use cases from the protocol or dApp for many months thereafter.\n\nAll these types of events inevitably result in an extremely short-term rapid rise in the price of the airdropped token and a subsequent prolonged drop. User engagement disappears as quickly as the value of the token.\n\nInstead, let’s look at some examples of the types of airdrops that I thought were really cool, super interesting, and resulted in positive experiences for both the users and the builders.\n\n## Phased Airdrops\n\nThe airdrops that are divided into distinct phases are very effective. They make the user come back again and again to interact with the dApp. This method also ensures that the token is not bombarded with massive amounts of sell pressure, all at once.\n\nThe most successful of these events I have personally experienced were those that tied receiving a portion of the airdrop to specific launches of dApps on the protocol, new functionality implemented in stages, or milestones reached. For example, I have seen numerous DeFi protocols use the following approach:\n\n* Phase One — launch the token and enable staking\n* Phase Two — open the swap functionality\n* Phase Three — open the liquidity pools\n* Phase Four — commence incentivized farming.\n\nOf course, if extended periods of time pass between these phases, the effects are diluted and user engagement is weakened.\n\n## A Task Oriented Approach\n\nI really like this type of an airdrop, because working for the free tokens is the way to ensure user engagement with the products.\n\nSpecific examples of the task oriented approach include:\n\n* transfer the tokens across a bridge\n* stake some of the tokens\n* participate in a governance vote\n* swap some of the airdropped tokens to another token that interacts with the blockchain, protocol, or dApp.\n* supply collateral to a lending dApp.\n* mint a stabletoken.\n\nAs a user, I want to perform multiple tasks, because that way I really learn how the protocol works and what is possible with the technology. Usually, it also leads me to try other products, inject additional funds, or increase my engagement.\n\n## Implement Utility First\n\nOne of my pet peeves is receiving tokens in an airdrop and excitedly going to the dApp to see what is offered and finding….nothing!\n\nYou all know who you are: ghost chains, protocols under construction, and invisible dApps floating around in the crypto universe that have tokens and nothing else. What is the point of releasing a token if you are not going to have utility ready and deployed first?\n\nNew builders, can you please make sure you have utility implemented when you release your airdrop? If that seems daunting, I have seen plenty of chains launch testnets, airdrop tokens on the testnet, get lots of user interaction, work out all the bugs, and subsequently launch successfully on the mainnet to a wider audience.\n\n## NFT Drops\n\nNothing puzzles me more than new NFT projects that generate lots of community engagement with amazing marketing campaigns, launch a successful genesis NFT collection with beautiful designs, just to go silent for months and not do a thing.\n\nWhy not take advantage of all that excitement and have multiple, additional functionalities and products ready to deploy in the weeks and months following the genesis drop? I have seen plenty of great airdrop ideas for this concept, including:\n\n* airdrops of auxiliary collections to the genesis NFT owners\n* airdrop loot NFT’s to the genesis NFT owners\n* have the NFT unlock opportunities in a game\n* launch a secondary collection and use the same airdrop strategy\n* use NFT airdrops to users that perform tasks in the dApps.\n\nAnd since I am such a staunch opponent of those exclusive “reservation lists”, here is another idea that I have seen work with great success. Launch a token, which the prospective owners of the NFT can purchase, stake, and farm it in order to receive a ticket to the minting event. Who needs a “exclusionary list” when you have a ticket machine?\n\nAnd then there is the whole concept of reward NFT’s being developed, literally as we speak. These NFT’s could also be airdropped, but the tokens are received over time as rewards, which are tied directly to the NFT.\n\n## Novel Approaches\n\nThe protocols that come up with the most unique approaches to getting their tokens in circulation via airdrops are the ones that I believe have experienced the most success.\n\nBesides the ones mentioned above, I have encountered additional (more complicated) examples, including:\n\n* requiring tokens to be bonded and farmed\n* vesting of tokens with a steady stream of rewards\n* locking up tokens with a promise of future rewards\n* paying out increasing amounts of rewards depending on the length of the lock-up periods\n* providing liquid derivative tokens in return for staking tokens.\n\nAll of these methods ensure the longevity of the protocol and the stability of the token.\n\n## Executing for Success\n\nAs I embark on a new adventure, one that once again involves airdrops, I wanted to share some of my thoughts on the subject with you. Obviously this is not an exhaustive list and I would love to hear from you what other effective airdrops you have participated in.\n\nThere are as many different points of view on how to successfully execute an airdrop, as there are protocols in the crypto universe. Therefore, I suspect that the Great Airdrop Debate will rage on. But, next time when you participate in that airdrop for a token that has no utility, you know what to do.

Another BYD Auto model, the all-electric e6, also made it onto the top 10 list after selling 3,560 units in China. Adding 132 sales of the Denza, BYD’s joint-venture model with Daimler, gave BYD almost a quarter of the 74,763 plug-in electric vehicle purchases reported sold by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers for 2014. \n\n[去年](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/china-calls-for-30-of-government-cars-to-use-alternative-fuel)，比亚迪的国内市场因一项为期24 个月的任务而得到提振，该任务要求所有新的政府车辆中有 30% 由替代能源提供燃料。此外，在 2017 年之前免除国内外电动汽车 10% 的购置税。\n\n尽管与 2013 年相比，该市场增长了 324%，但这些措施似乎无法实现中国政府在今年年底前实现 50 万辆电动汽车上路的目标。相反，中国汽车工业协会预计今年市场销量将达到 150,000 至 200,000 辆。\n\n这对比亚迪来说将是一个小小的安慰，该公司也一直寄希望于中国电动汽车市场的快速增长，上个月不得不宣布2014[年全年利润初步](https://www.wsj.com/articles/byd-preliminary-2014-net-profit-down-21-1424957467)下降 21% ，尽管收入增长了 10.3%。\n\n该公司现在似乎越来越关注国外市场。除巴西外，比亚迪还在比利时、哥伦比亚、哥斯达黎加和英国等国家销售汽车。\n\n诚然，这个数字很小：例如，伦敦专车服务[Thriev](http://www.thriev.com/)有 200 个 e6 。它在国际上最成功的地方可能是电动巴士的商业化。比亚迪已将这些产品置于远至土耳其和乌拉圭的试点计划中。\n\n上个月，沃伦巴菲特的伯克希尔哈撒韦企业集团持有该公司 10% 的股份，在获得京都五辆公共汽车的订单后，该公司成功成为第一家进入日本市场的中国汽车制造商。  \n\n“日本市场对技术和质量的要求非常严格，”比亚迪亚太汽车集团总经理刘学良在[新闻稿中表示](http://www.byd.com/news/news-275.html)。\n\n绿色交通似乎是比亚迪前进的王牌。\n\n在上个月宣布利润下降之前，该公司已通过以[23 亿元人民币](http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1711688/byd-raises-23b-yuan-selling-subsidiary)（约合 3.67 亿美元）的交易将其深圳比亚迪电子元件子公司出售给触摸屏制造商合力泰来巩固其在投资者中的地位。\n\n消息一出，股市大涨。但最近对比亚迪投资者的刺激与该公司的任何行动无关。相反，本月早些时候，它受益于一段关于中国空气污染[的视频](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-curbs-discussion-of-documentary-on-air-pollution-2015-03-02)的播出，该视频已成为病毒式的热门话题。\n\n感觉到这部纪录片可能会促使中国政府制定新的环保措施，瑞士信贷[分析师表示](http://blogs.barrons.com/asiastocks/2015/03/02/byd-jumps-as-air-pollution-stirs-public-passion-in-china/)：“比亚迪应该是主要的受益者。”\n\n这家分析公司对比亚迪股票给出“买入”建议，[高盛](http://blogs.barrons.com/asiastocks/2015/02/12/byd-sells-electronics-components-business-goldman-ups-to-buy/)上个月预测比亚迪从现在到 2020 年的年增长率可能达到 57%。", "timestamp": 1658292556, "digest": "F7caPMPyPdokYL9n25iMONJ1pA3BnTB-o3Gn3n98P-Q", "contributor": "0x68947AF9B1FeFDca7819F6955d35b336dcCEF725"}

"特定历史时期的不同社会中，并存着不同的群体和生产关系，它们看似自发形成的不同生存经验和秩序规则之中包含着的价值基础，并不能简单的用一种外在性的先验视角去创制，先验的创制办法往往会带来价值冲突甚至极端对立的境地，企图用理性世界去支配感性世界的方法不能容纳所有的个体和实际，对于 Web3 背景下的 DAO 治理模式而言亦是如此。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/72KNsIl.png)\n\n## 一、价值基础的转向\n\n在人类社会变革的过程中，社会整体始终保持着超出现状的诉求，这个诉求在不断变化，其所蕴含的价值基础被不断地扩充，从基本的「生存」到「自由、平等」再到今天的丰富内容，它的外延不断地拓展，但究其原因，并不能简单的用「应然」去应付，这种外在性的价值基础并不能用来调整和规范所有的生存方式。\n\n### 1.1 外在性价值基础的失效\n\n**传统形而上学将世界分为了理性世界和感性世界，希望用理性世界去支配感性世界。** 同时将身体和意识剥离开来，并强调意识的先导性，即「在纯粹身体和纯粹心灵的二分中抑身扬心」，用先验的视角把超验的世界构想为最真实的世界及理想化的评判准绳。这种外在、超验视角下的价值基础及评判标准曾在西方思想史上占据主导地位，**从柏拉图到黑格尔，再到边沁和康德，都是在以这种方式将价值基础归于理性的推演**，并基于此预设标准用以调整人类的生存方式，**但这种标准一定程度上并不具有普适性，换言之，这就是外在性价值的失效**。\n\n在「电车难题」中，同样的「五条生命对一条生命」，我们预设的价值基础不具有普适性，举重以明轻，在 Web3 的 DAO 治理模式中，这种预设性的价值基础同样不具有普适性，不论是边沁的功利主义（要欢愉不要痛苦，为了整体的、更多的福利），还是以康德为代表的绝对主义价值观（从评判的视角，将理性作为道德的基础，将价值基础建立在人类的理性之上，用价值基础充当评判行为的原则），对于五条生命对一条生命的选择问题上尚且存在着极端对立的情况，更遑论基于不同群体间的共识竞合而衍生的纷繁的行为方式？\n\n### 1.2 内在性价值基础的兴起\n\n内在价值论的后现代转向，颠覆了绝对主义价值观，以德勒兹为代表的后现代主义哲学家认为，人类的生存经验才是价值基础。他搭建起价值基础与人类的经验的桥梁，使人类的生存模式成为创造新价值的基石。这一内在性的视角明显区别于康德的超验哲学，**德勒兹认为人类的生存经验才是价值基础的真正起源，强调应当从人类经验本身出发评断人类的行为**。而外在的评判准绳被具象为价值观中的怜悯、仁慈、平等、善良等，它们被寄予期待去束缚强者的生命本能，但这些价值的背后都是一段段奴隶推翻主人的故事，**这些价值站在奴隶的立场，基于奴隶的思维模式**。\n\n以「权力意志」为例，权力意志并不是狭隘的局限于对权力的追求和渴望，它本身反映的是主体的生命本能，而权力本身不存在，是奴隶眼中的主人所拥有的，奴隶希望自己被表象为主人，拥有主人所拥有的所谓权力，这是奴隶的诉求，但也只是奴隶的诉求，正如「奴隶并不因获得权力就不再是奴隶」，奴隶所追求并实现的诉求并不是所有共同体的诉求，只是奴隶为了奴隶本身的利益自己构想的价值基础。**传统形而上学所推崇的价值观是弱者、奴隶的思维模式，这种思维模式下创制的价值基础是为了去束缚强者**：\n\n* 一方面，**这种思维模式割裂了所有共同体**，只是基于奴隶的立场和利益，并抛弃了处于奴隶对立面的主人的立场和利益。\n* 另一方面，**基于身体主导的主人价值观认为身体就是全部**，「上帝、理性、自我意识」都不是价值基础的根源，换句话说，我们每个人都是自己的主人，不必为他人使自己表象为他人意识中的主人，故而**支配自己的所有系理所应当的道理，这一点覆盖了当前 Web3 对于「所有权」的共识**。\n\n如此看，DAO 治理模式之价值基础并非基于奴隶价值以向强者控诉，而是在一片混沌中不拘于传统形而上学之束缚而自成各自的元宇宙、并相互交织。**相比于奴隶价值观，这种主人价值观更具有普适性，它把价值基础的根基奠定在现实客观的人类生存经验之中**，这里的现实客观广义的将所有的共同体都涵盖在其中，并不局限于 Web3，故而从内在性的视角去看待价值的根源和形成，这种方式更具有科学性和实质性，也具有价值基础从外在性向内在性转向的说服力。\n\n## 二、价值基础的根基\n\n后现代主义哲学家们虽然抹开笼罩在价值基础上的虚无主义的面纱，但是在生存经验之下应该还存在着更根源性的，更原始的驱动力去推进价值基础的变迁，它一方面在微观上体现为不同的个体基于生命本能的自行决断，另一方面在宏观上表征为人类社会在各种力求相互承认相互倾轧的合力之下逐渐形成的公允标准。\n\n### 2.1 根基之生命本能\n\n后现代主义哲学认为将现实生活和经验作为价值基础，同时指出秩序也并非恒古不变，它一并随着人类的生存经验作出调整，所有的价值基础都内在于人类的现实生活。但生存经验本身也并非价值无涉，**人类的现实生活对同一人类经验的内在性价值基础的同一性无从保证**，需要注意的是，我们并不需要一个无涉的价值评判标准，我们抛弃超验视角下的外在性的价值基础是因为它完全割裂了主观世界，而对于「谁去评判」的问题，既不应是我们预先设置的道德标准也不应是单纯的人类经验，应该是追根溯源到生命本能，人类基于生命本能不断调整自己的生存方式以积累生存经验，上升到不同群体间的生存经验的竞合，再到所有共同体间的价值基础的竞合。\n\n以古希腊的思想自由起源为例，希腊是位于地中海且占地面积不大的半岛，因可用耕地少且耕地条件差，所以并不能为古希腊人民提供良好的农业生产环境，他们只能另辟蹊径去解决基本的生存问题，比如发展加工业、航海业等其他产业,这就使得希腊的社会经济结构逐渐由原始的自然经济向商品经济转化，这是希腊人在客观的现实条件下满怀对美好生活的主观向往对生存方式进行的改变，也是新的生存经验的创制，其背后反映的是基于基本的生命本能，而它附带的则是普遍而广泛的商品交换和货币经济的兴起,这就使得当时繁盛的独裁、专制、血缘政治开始与这股大的历史潮流格格不入，「希腊人民为了生存必须以民事主体自由、平等的身份为前提, 必须推翻与之相违的身份、特权」，它反映的是生产关系、生存经验改变的过程中，社会各阶级的利益对立和统一，另一方面,自由在生存经验的竞合下作为新的价值基础应运而生。\n\n生命本能毫无疑问不会站在中立立场，它相对而言带有相对强烈的主观色彩，另一方面它又包含着相比于它的主观色彩权重较大的客观性，这部分客观性是具有历史性的、规律性的，这部分客观性反映着人类社会进步的事实，如此看来，生命本能本身带有的这部分主观性不仅容纳了共同体主观性和现实客观性，并在此基础上对生存方式本身造成影响，甚至改变了所有共同体的生存经验，以至于对价值基础本身进行重新建构。\n\n### 2.2 根基之目的、利益\n\n在特定历史时期的社会中，**不同群体的生存经验和生产方式是不同的，它们来自不同主体在利益、目的驱动下的生命本能的竞合**，生命本能是基于人最原始、最基本的目的、利益产生的，而利益本身具有广泛性，按照赫克的观点，在一切社会中相互竞争的个人利益与集体利益都属于这个概念的范畴。这里可以从微观和宏观两个角度来看，从微观的角度来说，即对于个体来讲，目的和利益是他参与社会竞争的驱动力，这其中既包括该个体与其他客体的竞争，也包括该个体自我的竞争；而从宏观的角度来看，即对于整个社会乃至整个种族而言，目的和利益又是这个社会和种族参与自然竞争的驱动力。\n\n在德勒兹关于欲望的论述中，德勒兹和瓜塔里提出「欲望是基础设施的一部分」他们采用马克思的理论概念，同时对资本主义的运转作出了新的定义，认为物质生产的根本动力是欲望的生产，即**通过欲望的生产推动生产关系以及上层建筑的改变**，所以基于这一点出发，或许可以说物质生产的根本动力是目的、利益，而生产关系和上层建筑的改变，也是基于这点。\n\n生产关系、上层建筑的改变只是外壳的改变，除开本源的利益作为驱动力以外，还需要其他的中间力量去填充它的血肉，例如物质、民族、宗教和伦理等方面的支撑，在赫克和耶林所奠定的利益法学中的核心提到「法律是所有共同体相互对峙且为得到承认而相互争斗的物质、民族、宗教和伦理等方面的利益的合力」，而物质、民族、宗教和伦理正是上述的人类的生存经验的部分，法律象征着秩序和规则，在秩序和规则背后反映着价值基础的判断和取舍，在利益法学的视域下，从内在的角度来看，这句话就变成了**价值基础是所有人类共同体中相互对峙且为得到承认而相互争斗的基于生命本能的生存经验的合力**。\n\n## 三、价值基础的私利性\n\n马克思和恩格斯曾经说道：「……利益……将市民社会的成员联系在一起」。列宁认为，一切会现象都要「追溯到特定阶级的利益」。施坦因曾认识到：「利益是社会的原则」。19 世纪中期在全世界范围内发生的社会变革，在这个特殊的历史时期的哲学家试图从社会现象去寻找价值基础，并在这个过程中开始重视起经济、政治、社会与秩序之间的多元的联系，而**在几乎所有的社会阶级和社会原则等方面的论述中，「利益」一词频频出现**。\n\n耶林在 1872 年所作的《为权利而斗争》中深刻的指出，「法是权利行使和利益保护的工具」。法具有工具性，而工具本身没有价值基础可言，它的价值基础是使用和创造这个工具的人赋予的，希望能以它达到某种目的，马克思评价这个价值基础是服务于占统治地位的社会阶级的利益，这句话要一体两面的分析，一方面，去掉这句话的定语，**价值基础服务于利益**，另一方面，**在 DAO 治理中，统治阶级等身份的概念被淡化，权力通过合约等方式被赋予给每一位成员，故而在 DAO 治理中，价值基础所服务的主体至少在理论上切实服务了所有共同体**。\n\n### 3.1 社会共识中价值基础的私利性\n\n趋利避害是人之本性，在社会中，个体无法脱离社会，无法避免与其他人产生交集，尤其是在追求个人利益的过程中，会普遍的出现为自己谋取利益的同时也为社会谋取了利益，也就是**个人的「私利」向社会的「公益」转化**，这一点在 DAO 治理中同样也体现在个体利益与 DAO 组织利益的共振。这种现象在经济活动中体现的尤为明显，附随的是习惯和秩序，尽管它从结果上看是社会繁荣、秩序井然的原因，但本质上依旧是基于利益出发，具有很强的私利性。\n\n> 在社会发展某个很早的阶段，产生了这样一种需要：把每天重复着的产品生产、分配和交换用一个共同规则约束起来，借以使个人服从生产和交换的共同条件。这个规则首先表现为习惯，不久便成了法律。\n> ——恩格斯\n\n其中产品的生产、分配和交换在社会发展中体现着生产关系的发展，规则又分为两个阶段，即习惯和法律，而习惯反映的是社会共识，与生产关系进行相互影响和双向调整，在习惯经受住各种利益竞合的考验和冲突后，它被赋予价值基础并不断扩充，这个共识才有资格成为规则去约束处于这个生产关系中的共同体的行为并逐渐成为秩序。在生产关系的作用下，人们在过程中积累流传下来习惯、惯例和传统，并成为社会共识，这些社会共识是通过追求各自目标的个人行为的结合，最根本的还是利益的竞合，利益作为驱动力推动着规则和秩序的发展，推动着价值基础的变革。\n\n在以物易物的早期人类经济活动中，没有固定统一的交换媒介，而因为众多人易物需求的不同，恰好符合交易需求和条件的情况并不多见，「为了能更加顺利地交换到自己恰好需要的东西或者使得自己的货物能得到更多的交换从而实现更多人的交换目的」，一种在物理上具有稳定性、在时空上具有任意性、在交易中具有便捷性的中介物就成了在这个经济活动中的所有共同体迫切需要的，从有这个需要到这个中介物的产生还有一段过程，当这个经济活动的某次交易中，其中单个或多个主体拥有其他主体的需求交集的货物时，他们理所应当能够与其他人进行更多的交易。而随着这种情况和次数的增加，大家慢慢注意到这种情况，于是为了获取同样的利益，占有类似同样的优势，模仿和学习就发生了，随着时间推移，这种受欢迎的货物的使用价值慢慢被它的其他价值替代，只是因为其更加方便的进行交易，在交易活动中的人们会更加广泛的接受它作为交易活动的中介物，而此时这个中介物的产生就进入了下一个阶段，即遴选淘汰的阶段，因为伴随着对中介物需求的不断增加，它要面临更多利益的竞合，直观反映的结果就是中介物种类的急剧减少，直到最后某种或某几种被保留下来，成了货币。\n\n这种非刻意安排的无组织行为形成了一种对在这个交易活动中的所有共同体都构成约束力的共识，督促着他们按照统一的办法去采取行为，这也是最早期的货币制度，货币的起源体现了制度的约束力和人们基于利益采取一切行为的本质特征。\n\n### 3.2 社会秩序中价值基础的私利性\n\n每个人都只能掌握社会知识总量中的一小部分，这部分相对于整个人类社会而言是微不足道的，在很大程度上，他们还是无知的，他们短暂有限的生命里所攫取的有限的理性与人类社会的浩瀚如烟、纷繁庞大比起来过于渺小，而正是因为社会知识的庞大和人类所掌握知识的渺小，所以无法在先验的视角下去建构社会秩序，它必须要容纳事实和环境，而这些是单单凭理性所无法认知和理解把握的。「任何自然状态的存在都不是先验的」，不论是社会制度的发展还是科学技术知识的增进等等，正如上述货币的起源，原始社会的交易参与者对于货币毫无概念，也无从意识到创造货币的行为，他们只是单纯的基于利益去采取行为，并在共识中产生了具有约束力的规则，形成了秩序，这个社会秩序的创制过程是循序渐进的实践过程的产物，一方面它包含着生存经验和社会共识，另一方面它带着明显的自发性，并非基于理性构建，而是纯粹的在追求个人利益时所形成，这种**自发性的秩序相比外力设置的预设性规则更能有效的保护人们的利益**，因为外力设置的预设性规则并不能洞察所有人所处的境遇，而**自发性的秩序是基于所有共同体的利益合力形成的**。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qQbYvPJ.jpg)\n\n一个社会的现行秩序能否在利益冲突的压力下免于崩溃，要以现行生产关系是否仍然具有历史合理性为决定性条件。到这里，其实呈现在我们面前的是**利益、生产关系和秩序价值的三角循环递进上升的动态关系图**，在不同时空中，容纳了理性和实际的生产关系基于所有共同体的利益出发形成了社会秩序，而其价值基础再从利益出发衍生出更高一层的生产关系，继而有了新的利益和新的价值基础，如此往复，而推动它们这样螺旋式上升递进的原始动力仅仅是利益而已，这也是 DAO 治理与 Fi 存在高度适配性的原因之一。\n\n## 四、结论\n\n虔诚迎接元宇宙到来的我们，或应自成各自的元宇宙而相互交互，利益作为本源和驱动力，推动着整个生态的发展、秩序建构和价值基础创制，反哺并与传统产业及现实社会共振，当我们真正考虑所有共同体所遭遇的境遇，摆在我们面前的是赤裸裸的、实质的利益竞合问题，而不是理想、基于理性构建的道德教化，「应然」本身的先验性与主观倾向性使其做不到「中立」，价值基础本身无法用逻辑推理去创制，更需要注意的是去规避使用外在性的评判标准，在我们的 Web3 进程中，让共识充分的竞合，**让 DAO 治理在目的和利益的竞合中自行成长，形成其本身的原生态规则、约束力和价值基础**。\n\n参考文献\n一、著作类\n\\[1\\].\\[德\\]魏德士.法理学\\[M\\],丁晓春,吴越译,北京:法律出版社,2013年版,第232-241页.\n\\[2\\].张文显.法理学\\[M\\].北京:高等教育出版社,2011年版,第260-262页.\n\\[3\\].《马克思恩格斯选集》第3卷\\[M\\].北京:人民出版社,1995年版,第211页.\n\\[4\\].杨大春.语言·身体·他者:当代法国哲学的三大主题\\[M\\].北京:三联书店,2007年版,第125页.\n\\[5\\]\\[英\\]哈耶克.经济、科学与政治——哈耶克论文演讲集\\[M\\],冯克利译,江苏人民出版社,2003年版,第593页. \n\\[6\\]梁峰.知识与自由—哈耶克政治哲学研究\\[M\\],北京:知识产权出版社,2007年版,第51页.\n\\[7\\].Gilles

How do I show off my NFT playlist or that one off exclusive NFT song remix (well, ok... NFT 0008 off of a 1000 mint) that I paid a bomb for.\n\nRarity proof when it matters...how?\n\n**NFT Music Concert Tickets:** How practical is it to authenticate NFT tickets displayed as a screenshot / dApp at a crowded concert gate? This is as much an open question as it is food-for-thought.\n\nvia twitter, a user @Mousselect pointed me to **[this solution](https://faq.get-protocol.io/get-protocol-products/get-protocol-nft-ticket-explorer)** that may be worth investigating.\n\n**Label Copyright Infringement:** Selling 'beats' and 'loops' as NFTs are cool, but what happens when the artist who minted them, then sells the album or song to a record label? What happens to the rights of the NFT loop buyer to use it in a remix/tune...\n\n**Summary:** Corporates, Artists and Media organizations looking at the Metaverse, should see to it that these issues are ironed out before having them buy-in. Don't let men-in-Armani-suits sell a pitch deck that isn't finalized, yet filled with jargon du jour; (immutable ledger, block-chain, on-chain, DAO...etc.)\n\nWe aren't even talking about the \\[very real\\] blockchain inter-compatibility issues that arise. How would a music NFT bought on the Ethereum Blockchain play out when a user enters a \"metaverse\" running on the Algorand chain or the Solana chain and vice-versa. Would it be a seamless streaming experience for the user (avatar) as seamless as it is today when we *bluetooth* our music from headphones to car audio system?\n\nMusic NFTs before they are sold by studios and artistes should be addressing these questions. This would be the right way to methodically build Metaverses devoid of crypto-parasites, and speculators currently plaguing Web3.\n\n...but wait... there could be a solution to some of these issues. I could think of at least the first issue:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Sgni8CvFkjji-GpvG-nko.webp?height=394&width=701)\n\n### Community Wallets: For Enhanced NFT experiences\n\nTally Ho! is a new \"**[community owned and operated Web3 wallet](https://tally.cash/)**\" and since NFTs are all about building a sense of community while also allowing members of such communities to express their uniqueness, what if such a wallet had a feature and as food-for-thought, could for instance...\n\n**Unlock a higher fidelity version as an NFT song? -** This would encourage artistes to release NFTs of their songs offering perhaps a superior sampled version of the tune. We all know that music streaming services probably aren't streaming at optimal quality, **[as this 2019 article explains.](https://www.headphonesty.com/2019/07/sample-rate-bit-depth-bit-rate/)**\n\nWhat if...a wallet such as Tally Ho! were to intercept a Spotify users playlist using, **[the Spotify API,](https://www.headphonesty.com/2019/07/sample-rate-bit-depth-bit-rate/)** and if it detects a song on the user's playlist for which the user also has an NFT version -- the wallet could seamlessly stream the owned (higher quality) or even a unique re-mix that the artiste released only as an NFT? If I were a music artiste releasing an NFT this would be my strict mandate. \n\nLet's go further: The NFT could be recorded in a multichannel audio format - such as .mkv, where a single Music NFT could contain:\n\n* Instrumental version.\n* Acapella.\n* Minus 1 (karaoke)\n\nThis way, at a party, the NFT owner's playlist could go from Karaoke, to amateur DJ. All because they invested in a music NFT. (You have to give the NFT owner value in owning that music NFT which is otherwise available for free to all on Spotify or Apple music...)\n\nOf course, this would require a streaming player being part of the \"wallet\". But that's where community driven projects such as the Tally Ho! wallet can shine. Letting developers write enhancement 'plugins'. \n\n*This blog essay was written in response to a Blogging competition for the launch of the Tally Ho! wallet. I couldn't write just another article rehashing the virtues of a crypto- wallet (said to a Meta-Mask beating wallet). As a personal creative challenge to drive original thought, I brainstormed the above product ideas, aware they're worth a couple 100k to a product dept. at music streaming platforms looking at Web3.0-fying their platforms.*\n\nSpotify, or Tidal or Apple...others... if you are planning on integrating NFT audio using any of these ideas, please send fiat currency, my way.", "timestamp": 1658292769, "digest": "7t3E8vk158ZvZEVfozViZqoT6tEe1X94oWOj9raCz6I", "contributor": "0x3a2FD028203Aa86D4fFd8F8106eb50c1C9146723"}

VC）、潜水观察员（@connectfarm1）、匿名博士（Chris_Defi）、Jimmy（@CryptosLaowai）、大君（加密分析师）。这是0x499旗下 DeTalks 栏目第 24 期，主持人是 Linda Jiang（MEXC Global Listing Manager）。**\n\n**Linda Jiang（MEXC Global Listing Manager）**\n\n大家好，我是 Linda ，主要在 MEXC 负责 Global Listing 的工作，欢迎大家来到今天由 0x499 举办的 Twitter Space。我们知道比特币已经在 20000 美金横盘很久，后续会是一个什么样的行情走向，今天邀请几位嘉宾来共同参与讨论，首先请他们来进行以下自我介绍。\n\n**Bill（Co-founder of DeCentralized VC）**\n\n大家好，我是从 2020 年中期开始 DeFi 的第一批玩家，目前主要是做一些分析研究工作，寻找好的投资标的。很高兴今天有机会跟大家交流，一个是如何在熊市中生存下来，另外是如何在下一波牛市来临的时候获得最大回报。\n\n**大君（加密分析师）**\n\n大家好，我也是 0x499 的老朋友了，目前是一个加密分析师，之前是每天在微信视频做直播，给大家分析行情和一级二级市场，现在是每周四做一次，平时输出主要在 Twitter 和 视频号。\n\n**潜水观察员（@connectfarm1）**\n\n大家好，我是一个种子投资基金的联合创始人，也是 Avatar DAO 的联创之一，我们主要关注一级市场项目，我个人的喜好是 NFT，是一些项目的早期参与者。\n\n**Linda Jiang（MEXC Global Listing Manager）**\n\n我们看到 BTC 已经在 20000 美金附近横盘很久了，作为加密市场的风向标，BTC 仍然占据整个加密货币市值的 40% 以上，大家都很关心接下来的行情走向，各位嘉宾怎么看？\n\n**Bill（Co-founder of DeCentralized VC）**\n\n对于 BTC 的价格行情走势来说，我觉得如果你是长期价值投资者，可能不是太重要，你可以采取定投或者越低越买的策略来进行操作。比特币的走势首先是受整个大经济环境的影响，第二是目前加密货币行情走势很低，BTC 在美股里面算一支大型股票，同时又完全没有监管，我觉得是很容易被人操控的。对于这样的资产，无论你是去套用周期理论还是技术分析，都会产生有的时候对、有的时候不对的结果，到最后发现无论如何都很难去解释。在这种情况下我们去预测一周、两周甚至一个月的走势是很难的，但是从减半节点、经济带宽等相对长远的指标来分析的话，相对来说会更加准确一点。\n\n我用的分析方法都是采信至少三年以上的。因此短期来说很难判断，长期来说比如 2024 年减半会是一个比较好的话题，通常是牛市信号比较明确的时间点。作为长期价值投资者，你应该把握住减半前半年的时间点入场，做好自己的策略去执行投资行为。\n\n**潜水观察员（@connectfarm1）**\n\n虽然我个人基本不碰二级市场，但是通过观察二级市场，能够给一级市场很多指导。我记得当时在 6 月 26 号的时候，我们认为七八月份会有一波行情，研判的依据也比较简单，就是情绪和人心，情绪是投资者对市场上所有信息的终极反应，当时推特上有些人就已经低落到聊生死大事了，这个情况下肯定是个低谷，如果你问这一轮熊有没有到位，我觉得还没有，如果大家都觉得熊市结束、牛市要回来的时候，我会非常果断地去做一个波段。\n\n我们自己是长期持有 BNB 和 ETH，这不在我们操作仓位里面。我觉得之后的行情还是受大环境影响很明显的，像美股和美国经济、中国房地产、印度外汇，全球各个国家有各自的问题。如果这一轮金融去杠杆没有完完全全地到位，这种情况我认为不会迎来一个根本性转变，我们依然要去观察传统金融市场的走向，比如美国还没有大型银行发生倒闭挤兑，那这一轮危机可能就没结束，中国仅仅是二三线城市房地产暴跌、一线城市还在涨，再加上疫情的影响，大环境依然很动荡，我觉得最多到年底，不管是以太坊 2.0 是否落地，这一轮反弹都将告一段落，接下来随着整体市场的恶化，会导致进入一个新的混乱期，这是我的判断。\n\n**大君（加密分析师）**\n\n我从合约和期权两个角度分析一下接下来的行情，仅供大家参考。\n\n这两天 ETH 上涨了 40%，原因是 The Merge 在 7 月 14 号的一个利好，还有就是 1.3k-1.5k 期权的购买，整个操盘手是在 FTX，顺带拉爆了其他交易所的合约。我前两天也是发了一个推特，预测 ETH 这一波上涨在 1.3-1.5 附近，昨天是够到了 1.6k，但是没有到 1.7k，实际上技术指标是 1.7 附近。\n\n比特币跟以太坊不一样，受整体大行情影响，它是一个非常成熟的投资标的，最近的利好来自欧债危机，最近欧元指数和美元指数差不多持平了，美元一直在看涨，最近出现了回调，各大股指上涨，特别是美股指数和期货黄金指数，这跟比特币基本上是相对的调整方向。\n\n所以以太坊是由市场行情推动上涨的，比特币是由整体大行情上涨出现了回调。所以这两个是不同阶段涨的，而且涨的逻辑也不一样。接下来的走势我认为还是维持一个熊市的整体局面。上次我来 0x499 参加活动预测的回调价格是 18k，因为这是大旷工舍弃“挖、提、卖”的一个价格。最近的话我觉得可以关注一下 22-25 这个点，但还是提醒大家要注意止损，因为目前整体依然是熊市。\n\n**Linda Jiang（MEXC Global Listing Manager）**\n\n这一波熊市中，ETH回撤力度也非常大，基本上跌去了三分之二。应该来说发展这么多年， ETH 已经是和 BTC 完全不同的应用和估值逻辑，但是 ETH 的价格和一众 ERC20 Token 还是受 BTC 波动的影响很大，你认为未来有可能改变吗？\n\n**匿名博士（Chris_Defi）**\n\n我们看到比特币的市占率在下降。过去如果行情走到深熊的话，一般比特币的市占率是往上走的，虽然这一轮熊市多了很多新的玩法，无论是 DeFi、GameFi 还是公链，但是我依然觉得单一地去看比特币市占率的剧本已经过去了，可能未来我们要看比特币市占率和以太坊市占率的结合，最近的行情都在围绕 2.0 在讲故事，这是以太坊本身内部的叙事。\n\n在这一轮回调之前，其实整个加密货币的行情一直是跟着标普 500 走的，基本上美股现货价格都是由期权推动，现在期权在 3900 多，下方的 3700 有一个非常强的防守位。所以美股也是在一个区间内围绕着一个价格做无规律波动，从周线级别来看，美股最近还没有完全走出来，整个 8 月是处于事件空窗期，9 月可能会有一些大事件。只要美股没有大的下跌动作，或者在某个区间去徘徊的话，加密货币可能就会有一个像样的反弹，我个人倾向于下周会有一个回调，8 月份可能还会继续开启一个反弹。\n\n**Jimmy（@CryptosLaowai）**\n\n我是在中国生活的混血，在北京长大，2016 年大四开始炒币，也是经历过一轮超级大牛市和恶心的熊市这么一个完整的周期。我是一名交易员和分析师，一般都是炒现货，熊市会抄一些期货，但是期货只做空，如果看涨的话会分批买入现货的操作方式。预测对我来说是一个工具，比如说看到在上涨或者下跌 20% 的时候会有很多人暴涨，那我会在那个价格点附近开单，这时候流动性就非常好。另外刚刚 Bill 说的情绪面我觉得也是非常重要的，我主要是看 Twitter 和 Telegram 大群，这里面散户的情绪是非常重要的，一般行情是跟情绪反着走的，这是熊市逻辑，牛市是大家都赚钱，因为大饼是越摊越大。但是熊市主要是场内资金在相互博弈，所以我的思路是跟主流作对，但是这个也分时候。\n\n长期来看，我认为目前是熊市初期，马上要不如熊市中期。初期大家都不认为是熊市，认为是正常回调，反正没有跌破去年 519 的底部，现在还是牛市，在 3w 以上，3.3w-4.8w 那一波震荡，大部分人还是看牛市的。后来我观测的情绪是跌破 2.8w 以后，基本上所有人都默认我们在熊市中，这个没有错。但是当大家都这样转变过来思路的时候，这是熊市中间会出现的“牛陷阱”，在大家觉得牛市就要来了的时候，就是开一个低倍空的时候。\n\n目前这个位置，尤其是前两周，散户的情绪是集体看空，都认为大环境极差，加密圈就是美股，所以你炒币的还看什么 BTC，就看标普 500。但是明显上周出现一些变化，以太坊 2.0 的合并叙事出现了，两三周前我们也说过这件事情，大部分人那个时候觉得 7 月份还是不好的，但是我说可以观测 LDO 这个币，因为它是目前以太 2.0 最大的质押代币，如果这个币技术指标上进入日线级别下跌通道，如果跌破这个通道，肯定就是以太 2.0 叙事开始，所以我在 0.6 的位置特别关注以太坊的动作，果然汇率起来了，差不多是昨天和前天都在找这一波上涨的理由，这就是 2.0 叙事出现了。\n\n我的观点一直没变，七八月份是第一波涨，以太在 2200-2400 之间，9 月合并很有可能会推迟导致回调，这时候大概率会有一个极具看空的情绪，这个其实很好理解，过去六个月从 4800 跌到 880，好不容易有一个利好回弹，结果发现被骗了，这时候可能会跌到四五百，之后再开始反弹，就有一个牛市看涨的情绪了。这个画在图上就是一个 ABC 的三浪调整，我觉得这是一个非常好的工具。\n\n另外我是不看美股指标的，但是我知道这些时间和数据的时间点，但这是一个滞后的指标，反应的是已经发生的数据，一般这些数据放出来，价格会有一个明显波动。对加密圈来说，这主要是一个催化行情的作用，而不会改变行情的方向。\n\n我认为以太和大饼的关系已经发生一个脱钩，这是一个非常好的事情。大饼是没有故事讲的，唯一的就是 ETF，没有升级空间，算是加密圈最稳定的资产。但是以太是有各种各样的发展和用例，我相信在做很多人都没有比特币钱包，有的都是一些老韭菜，以太的用户特别多，网络效应特别强，以太出现独立叙事是标志着币圈在美股之前反弹了，但是大饼比较滞后，大饼没有涨，所以其他的也不会涨，这是一些人唯一看空的理由。\n\n所以 ETH 反弹我认为预示着后半年会有一个比较好的行情，走一个简单的预测，我认为大饼 11 月份会有一个 48000-53000 之间，明年再跌到八九千；ETH 涨到大概 3000-3600 之间，明年会跌到 390，这个跌幅有点大，但是我觉得币圈远远没有跌够，在场还赚钱的人太多了，基本上要回撤 90%，这个熊市才会结束。\n\n所以总体而言我是看好今年，不看好明年，然后 2024-2025 大周期会起来。另外减半不减半对于比特币的价格我认为影响很小，因为币圈是 24 小时交易，不像股市每天只交易几个小时，币牛熊转换周期会很快，熊市大概都是 16-28 个月，跟减半没关系，只是刚好对上。\n\n**大君（加密分析师）**\n\n我并不认为以太会跟大饼脱钩，底层还是以 BTC 作为一个头，因为它毕竟是加密圈底层共识。那这次以太反弹，很多人就会问后续到底是怎么走，看涨还是看跌。首先以太的话，我个人肯定是看好的，今年出来的新项目资金势力都不错，包括 Layer2 的 OP 啊等等，只要以太挺住了，这些代币的价格都不多。另外 ETC 是跟 The Merge 相关的，还有 APE，包括刚刚提到的 LDO，大家都可以去多观察，后续牛市的时候有可能成为新星。但是像之前 Luna 崩盘，我觉得还是跟 BTC 有很大关系。\n\n**Bill（Co-founder of DeCentralized VC）**\n\n对于以太坊，不管是 Layer0、Layer1 或者 Layer2 的前景，我们可能要反过来看。每一波牛市的开启都有它不一样的叙事方式，比如说上一轮的 ICO、这一轮的 Defi，如果下一轮大牛市在两年之后，那个时候叙事方式是从哪个领域出来，这个是很重要的。\n\n根据这个预测，我们可以反推一下有哪些东西还是欠缺的，尤其是在基础公链方面。我们作为散户很多时候是欠缺的，我们可以更加多地以来大 VC 的分析判断，他们经过了 N 多个牛熊的人，创始人是最早一批成功的人，同时扶持了大量的早期项目，所以我相信他们的感觉是比较准的。如果担心只依赖一个 VC 的眼光可能会出错，那可以看多个 VC 有没有共同押宝的赛道。\n\n目前现在大的 VC 都在投 web3。现在 web3 的雏形项目有一些欠缺的东西，第一个是钱包入口的易用性方面，第二个是很多项目在说的公链吞吐量并发量，第三个钱包安全也是非常头疼的问题，这是像 A16Z 等 VC 希望从这些方面能够在未来有所突破。\n\n至于说现在看到的比特币和以太，他们是两种不一样的资产类型，比特是共识堆积起来的价值存储方式，把它类比于黄金是现阶段比较好理解的；以太更多是生态建设催化剂的角色。这两者发展上脱钩是完全有可能的，目前币圈整个 TVL 还很小，如何能够真正吸引大资金进来，假设外汇交易市场有个 20%-50% 用区块链的方式去交易，成本更低效率更高，未来的数字货币市场就完全不一样了，体量是现在的 N 倍。到那种情况下，以太坊作为出圈的价值，潜力会更加大。\n\n**0x499**\n\n在 2021 年的牛市中，很多挑战以太坊的新公链获得了惊人的市值增长，个别公链比如 Solana 依靠链游的成功塑造了高性能的差异化定位，同时近期基于以太坊 Layer2 的项目代币热度很高，是否说明对于公链而言，高 TPS 和高可拓展性依然是支撑估值的关键？\n\n**潜水观察员（@connectfarm1）**\n\n我个人觉得 Layer2 现在是一个打问号的赛道。我没想明白为什么以太坊要转 2.0，更没想明白未来这么多公链有什么用。甚至不以成败论英雄的话，我觉得 ICP 和 Filecoin 提出的东西会更加 make sense 一点。所以终究这是一个情绪和预期主导的世界。比如大家之前说以太坊 2.0 是一个利空，这两天又是一个利好，过段时间又是一个利空。任何一个公链和底层技术都是随机性的，我们今天使用的互联网之前，在它之前可能由另一套协议表现更好，但是人类历史发展是由很多随机性组成的，我在想是不是以太坊当年出来的时候，在世界的另一个角落有一套智能合约技术和框架比以太坊优秀，只是恰好终于跑起来了。\n\n我觉得最重要的一点，是你的生态中究竟能吸引多少人口，如果你从这点来判断，甚至中国的联盟链都有机会。像前两天王老吉这种消费类巨头直接发 NFT，我们看到各种传统势力和巨头不断进来这个行业，最终胜出的未必是现在的以太坊，甚至未必是出自币圈。所以在我看来币圈长线命题不太成立。\n\n我们在思考 web3.0 投资的时候，会更多去想激励层而不是去中心化。比如说 DAO 有多大几率在未来会代替公司，而不是思考一个事情底层能去中心化成为一个什么东西。\n\n**Jimmy（@CryptosLaowai）**\n\n我觉得关键是公链的经济模型，比如 Solana 手续费非常低，但是需要通过无限制增发或者通货膨胀的方式 SOL 代币去给维护网络的节点，如果没有足够多的人去接盘的话，就很难维持价格坚挺。所以我觉得公链更多是 VC 的产物，它不是一个币圈原生的东西。\n\n下一个牛市肯定有 Layer1 故事可讲，在以太坊没有实现分片技术之前，以太坊是 VC 大面积踏空的一个项目，另外那些拿了 VC 钱的项目可能涨了一两轮就涨不动了，但是以太坊可以一直涨下去。这个可能也跟我自己的偏见有关，我在 17 年的时候投了 NEO，后来几乎归零。\n\n我非常同意 Bill 的观点，可以去看 VC 在做什么，我在上一轮牛市中买的币都是听一个 VC 朋友说的，所以大家看到团队特别好的项目可以在不怎么了解的时候，可以放很小的资金去买一点，然后设定一个一到两年的退出周期。\n\n相比于 Layer1，我更看好 Layer2，因为 Layer2 要比 Layer1 容易构建，尤其是 Optimisitic Layer2，比如某一个游戏完全可以把 OP 分叉一个，受益于以太坊的网络效应和安全性，所以 Layer2 会吸引特别多的资金过去。\n\n**0x499**\n\n其他一些板块，比如 NFT、GameFi、元宇宙概念的代币，在熊市结束之前有没有一些结构性投资机会？\n\n**Bill（Co-founder of DeCentralized VC）**\n\n熊市是最好的投资和建设时机，如果你在牛市或者牛市中后期再去投资，通常都会是一个韭菜。以这种投资理念来说，熊市是一个好机会。首先在熊市的时候，有些二级的价格要低于一级的价格，所以你作为一个散户，可以去割 VC 的韭菜，从这个方面来说无论是 NFT、GameFi 还是元宇宙，都可以在深熊的时候可以找到很好的标的。\n\n另外 NFT 项目和 NFT 平台是要区分来看的。图片的话在我看来觉得大多数都是归零的，每天 Opensea 上出来的项目太多了，压中的概率是非常小的，除非你真的把握住背后的团队和文化，一般散户在这方面是蛮难的。所以对 NFT 市场更加建议关注基础建设和工具类产品，熊市是一个最佳时机。比如说 GameFi 里面使用 NFT 的数量是最大的，比如说 Flow 承载了 100 个 NFT 项目，即便是大部分都死掉了，只有一两个跑出来，Flow 依然可以吃到项目增长的红利。\n\n第二个是可以找新的机会，做一级市场，我是传统投资做一级市场出来的，以前传统做一级失败的概率是很高的，但利润优势最丰厚的，如果你看准项目和团队，所以在熊市里面我不会放弃去找优质团队和项目的机会。一级的判断是相当难的，直接去做对方向、人的把握是挑战非常大的，我用的衡量标准就是找这些创业团队的发起人，要求至少在圈里面 4 年以上的连续创业者，选择的方向至少要符合下一个赛道有最大流量增长的那个，那我们就可以去搏一把，同时也要做好评估，不要把鸡蛋放在一个篮子里面，熊市的好处是估值比较低，一般你可以找市场影响力的 VC 一起投，每个 VC  的成本不会很高。\n\n熊市很长的时候，我们可以慢慢看，不像牛市的时候要在 24 小时内定下来，抢不到就没了。目前我手里面也有很多这样的团队，如果有些项目越到熊市越起劲，那你就要多给些关注的。所以这是二级和一级两种方法并用起来，在熊市中找投资机会的方法。\n\n**大君（加密分析师）**\n\n我认为 GameFi 还是有非常大的机会，去年 VC 大概一共往 GameFi 赛道投了 40 亿，现在是 100 亿。我最近也在做一个 GameFi 的 IGO，可以看到整个游戏页面和画质都比之前有很大增长，这些项目的一级打新还是有一定机会的。\n\n另外 NFT 我研究了一些巨鲸，他们基本上人手 3000 多个甚至 1w 个都有，现在玩法还是以土狗为先，大户是能够拿出一些现金流来玩 NFT 的，比如说 30 个 ETH，最后拿到 150-180 ETH，这种情况是存在的。但是 NFT 玩家基本都是长期 holder，基本都是 46 天以上，因为 NFT 流动性是要挂单拍卖。\n\n其他我看到行业里面一些赚钱机会，一个是元宇宙，即便是在熊市里面也是能够发光发热。当然也有一些别的，比如说空投的 OP 等等。所以熊市里面也会有很多一级的机会，该赚钱的还是会赚钱，但肯定是要大浪淘沙，一定要沉下心来看。\n\n\n---\n\n```\n                                 END

Would it be a seamless streaming experience for the user (avatar) as seamless as it is today when we *bluetooth* our music from headphones to car audio system?\n\nMusic NFTs before they are sold by studios and artistes should be addressing these questions. This would be the right way to methodically build Metaverses devoid of crypto-parasites, and speculators currently plaguing Web3.\n\n...but wait... there could be a solution to some of these issues.

VC）、潜水观察员（@connectfarm1）、匿名博士（Chris_Defi）、Jimmy（@CryptosLaowai）、大君（加密分析师）。这是0x499旗下 DeTalks 栏目第 24 期，主持人是 Linda Jiang（MEXC Global Listing Manager）。**\n\n**Linda Jiang（MEXC Global Listing Manager）**\n\n大家好，我是 Linda ，主要在 MEXC 负责 Global Listing 的工作，欢迎大家来到今天由 0x499 举办的 Twitter Space。我们知道比特币已经在 20000 美金横盘很久，后续会是一个什么样的行情走向，今天邀请几位嘉宾来共同参与讨论，首先请他们来进行以下自我介绍。\n\n**Bill（Co-founder of DeCentralized VC）**\n\n大家好，我是从 2020 年中期开始 DeFi 的第一批玩家，目前主要是做一些分析研究工作，寻找好的投资标的。很高兴今天有机会跟大家交流，一个是如何在熊市中生存下来，另外是如何在下一波牛市来临的时候获得最大回报。\n\n**大君（加密分析师）**\n\n大家好，我也是 0x499 的老朋友了，目前是一个加密分析师，之前是每天在微信视频做直播，给大家分析行情和一级二级市场，现在是每周四做一次，平时输出主要在 Twitter 和 视频号。\n\n**潜水观察员（@connectfarm1）**\n\n大家好，我是一个种子投资基金的联合创始人，也是 Avatar DAO 的联创之一，我们主要关注一级市场项目，我个人的喜好是 NFT，是一些项目的早期参与者。\n\n**Linda Jiang（MEXC Global Listing Manager）**\n\n我们看到 BTC 已经在 20000 美金附近横盘很久了，作为加密市场的风向标，BTC 仍然占据整个加密货币市值的 40% 以上，大家都很关心接下来的行情走向，各位嘉宾怎么看？\n\n**Bill（Co-founder of DeCentralized VC）**\n\n对于 BTC 的价格行情走势来说，我觉得如果你是长期价值投资者，可能不是太重要，你可以采取定投或者越低越买的策略来进行操作。比特币的走势首先是受整个大经济环境的影响，第二是目前加密货币行情走势很低，BTC 在美股里面算一支大型股票，同时又完全没有监管，我觉得是很容易被人操控的。对于这样的资产，无论你是去套用周期理论还是技术分析，都会产生有的时候对、有的时候不对的结果，到最后发现无论如何都很难去解释。在这种情况下我们去预测一周、两周甚至一个月的走势是很难的，但是从减半节点、经济带宽等相对长远的指标来分析的话，相对来说会更加准确一点。\n\n我用的分析方法都是采信至少三年以上的。因此短期来说很难判断，长期来说比如 2024 年减半会是一个比较好的话题，通常是牛市信号比较明确的时间点。作为长期价值投资者，你应该把握住减半前半年的时间点入场，做好自己的策略去执行投资行为。\n\n**潜水观察员（@connectfarm1）**\n\n虽然我个人基本不碰二级市场，但是通过观察二级市场，能够给一级市场很多指导。我记得当时在 6 月 26 号的时候，我们认为七八月份会有一波行情，研判的依据也比较简单，就是情绪和人心，情绪是投资者对市场上所有信息的终极反应，当时推特上有些人就已经低落到聊生死大事了，这个情况下肯定是个低谷，如果你问这一轮熊有没有到位，我觉得还没有，如果大家都觉得熊市结束、牛市要回来的时候，我会非常果断地去做一个波段。\n\n我们自己是长期持有 BNB 和 ETH，这不在我们操作仓位里面。我觉得之后的行情还是受大环境影响很明显的，像美股和美国经济、中国房地产、印度外汇，全球各个国家有各自的问题。如果这一轮金融去杠杆没有完完全全地到位，这种情况我认为不会迎来一个根本性转变，我们依然要去观察传统金融市场的走向，比如美国还没有大型银行发生倒闭挤兑，那这一轮危机可能就没结束，中国仅仅是二三线城市房地产暴跌、一线城市还在涨，再加上疫情的影响，大环境依然很动荡，我觉得最多到年底，不管是以太坊 2.0 是否落地，这一轮反弹都将告一段落，接下来随着整体市场的恶化，会导致进入一个新的混乱期，这是我的判断。\n\n**大君（加密分析师）**\n\n我从合约和期权两个角度分析一下接下来的行情，仅供大家参考。\n\n这两天 ETH 上涨了 40%，原因是 The Merge 在 7 月 14 号的一个利好，还有就是 1.3k-1.5k 期权的购买，整个操盘手是在 FTX，顺带拉爆了其他交易所的合约。我前两天也是发了一个推特，预测 ETH 这一波上涨在 1.3-1.5 附近，昨天是够到了 1.6k，但是没有到 1.7k，实际上技术指标是 1.7 附近。\n\n比特币跟以太坊不一样，受整体大行情影响，它是一个非常成熟的投资标的，最近的利好来自欧债危机，最近欧元指数和美元指数差不多持平了，美元一直在看涨，最近出现了回调，各大股指上涨，特别是美股指数和期货黄金指数，这跟比特币基本上是相对的调整方向。\n\n所以以太坊是由市场行情推动上涨的，比特币是由整体大行情上涨出现了回调。所以这两个是不同阶段涨的，而且涨的逻辑也不一样。接下来的走势我认为还是维持一个熊市的整体局面。上次我来 0x499 参加活动预测的回调价格是 18k，因为这是大旷工舍弃“挖、提、卖”的一个价格。最近的话我觉得可以关注一下 22-25 这个点，但还是提醒大家要注意止损，因为目前整体依然是熊市。\n\n**Linda Jiang（MEXC Global Listing Manager）**\n\n这一波熊市中，ETH回撤力度也非常大，基本上跌去了三分之二。应该来说发展这么多年， ETH 已经是和 BTC 完全不同的应用和估值逻辑，但是 ETH 的价格和一众 ERC20 Token 还是受 BTC 波动的影响很大，你认为未来有可能改变吗？\n\n**匿名博士（Chris_Defi）**\n\n我们看到比特币的市占率在下降。过去如果行情走到深熊的话，一般比特币的市占率是往上走的，虽然这一轮熊市多了很多新的玩法，无论是 DeFi、GameFi 还是公链，但是我依然觉得单一地去看比特币市占率的剧本已经过去了，可能未来我们要看比特币市占率和以太坊市占率的结合，最近的行情都在围绕 2.0 在讲故事，这是以太坊本身内部的叙事。\n\n在这一轮回调之前，其实整个加密货币的行情一直是跟着标普 500 走的，基本上美股现货价格都是由期权推动，现在期权在 3900 多，下方的 3700 有一个非常强的防守位。所以美股也是在一个区间内围绕着一个价格做无规律波动，从周线级别来看，美股最近还没有完全走出来，整个 8 月是处于事件空窗期，9 月可能会有一些大事件。只要美股没有大的下跌动作，或者在某个区间去徘徊的话，加密货币可能就会有一个像样的反弹，我个人倾向于下周会有一个回调，8 月份可能还会继续开启一个反弹。\n\n**Jimmy（@CryptosLaowai）**\n\n我是在中国生活的混血，在北京长大，2016 年大四开始炒币，也是经历过一轮超级大牛市和恶心的熊市这么一个完整的周期。我是一名交易员和分析师，一般都是炒现货，熊市会抄一些期货，但是期货只做空，如果看涨的话会分批买入现货的操作方式。预测对我来说是一个工具，比如说看到在上涨或者下跌 20% 的时候会有很多人暴涨，那我会在那个价格点附近开单，这时候流动性就非常好。另外刚刚 Bill 说的情绪面我觉得也是非常重要的，我主要是看 Twitter 和 Telegram 大群，这里面散户的情绪是非常重要的，一般行情是跟情绪反着走的，这是熊市逻辑，牛市是大家都赚钱，因为大饼是越摊越大。但是熊市主要是场内资金在相互博弈，所以我的思路是跟主流作对，但是这个也分时候。\n\n长期来看，我认为目前是熊市初期，马上要不如熊市中期。初期大家都不认为是熊市，认为是正常回调，反正没有跌破去年 519 的底部，现在还是牛市，在 3w 以上，3.3w-4.8w 那一波震荡，大部分人还是看牛市的。后来我观测的情绪是跌破 2.8w 以后，基本上所有人都默认我们在熊市中，这个没有错。但是当大家都这样转变过来思路的时候，这是熊市中间会出现的“牛陷阱”，在大家觉得牛市就要来了的时候，就是开一个低倍空的时候。\n\n目前这个位置，尤其是前两周，散户的情绪是集体看空，都认为大环境极差，加密圈就是美股，所以你炒币的还看什么 BTC，就看标普 500。但是明显上周出现一些变化，以太坊 2.0 的合并叙事出现了，两三周前我们也说过这件事情，大部分人那个时候觉得 7 月份还是不好的，但是我说可以观测 LDO 这个币，因为它是目前以太 2.0 最大的质押代币，如果这个币技术指标上进入日线级别下跌通道，如果跌破这个通道，肯定就是以太 2.0 叙事开始，所以我在 0.6 的位置特别关注以太坊的动作，果然汇率起来了，差不多是昨天和前天都在找这一波上涨的理由，这就是 2.0 叙事出现了。\n\n我的观点一直没变，七八月份是第一波涨，以太在 2200-2400 之间，9 月合并很有可能会推迟导致回调，这时候大概率会有一个极具看空的情绪，这个其实很好理解，过去六个月从 4800 跌到 880，好不容易有一个利好回弹，结果发现被骗了，这时候可能会跌到四五百，之后再开始反弹，就有一个牛市看涨的情绪了。这个画在图上就是一个 ABC 的三浪调整，我觉得这是一个非常好的工具。\n\n另外我是不看美股指标的，但是我知道这些时间和数据的时间点，但这是一个滞后的指标，反应的是已经发生的数据，一般这些数据放出来，价格会有一个明显波动。对加密圈来说，这主要是一个催化行情的作用，而不会改变行情的方向。\n\n我认为以太和大饼的关系已经发生一个脱钩，这是一个非常好的事情。大饼是没有故事讲的，唯一的就是 ETF，没有升级空间，算是加密圈最稳定的资产。但是以太是有各种各样的发展和用例，我相信在做很多人都没有比特币钱包，有的都是一些老韭菜，以太的用户特别多，网络效应特别强，以太出现独立叙事是标志着币圈在美股之前反弹了，但是大饼比较滞后，大饼没有涨，所以其他的也不会涨，这是一些人唯一看空的理由。\n\n所以 ETH 反弹我认为预示着后半年会有一个比较好的行情，走一个简单的预测，我认为大饼 11 月份会有一个 48000-53000 之间，明年再跌到八九千；ETH 涨到大概 3000-3600 之间，明年会跌到 390，这个跌幅有点大，但是我觉得币圈远远没有跌够，在场还赚钱的人太多了，基本上要回撤 90%，这个熊市才会结束。\n\n所以总体而言我是看好今年，不看好明年，然后 2024-2025 大周期会起来。另外减半不减半对于比特币的价格我认为影响很小，因为币圈是 24 小时交易，不像股市每天只交易几个小时，币牛熊转换周期会很快，熊市大概都是 16-28 个月，跟减半没关系，只是刚好对上。\n\n**大君（加密分析师）**\n\n我并不认为以太会跟大饼脱钩，底层还是以 BTC 作为一个头，因为它毕竟是加密圈底层共识。那这次以太反弹，很多人就会问后续到底是怎么走，看涨还是看跌。首先以太的话，我个人肯定是看好的，今年出来的新项目资金势力都不错，包括 Layer2 的 OP 啊等等，只要以太挺住了，这些代币的价格都不多。另外 ETC 是跟 The Merge 相关的，还有 APE，包括刚刚提到的 LDO，大家都可以去多观察，后续牛市的时候有可能成为新星。但是像之前 Luna 崩盘，我觉得还是跟 BTC 有很大关系。\n\n**Bill（Co-founder of DeCentralized VC）**\n\n对于以太坊，不管是 Layer0、Layer1 或者 Layer2 的前景，我们可能要反过来看。每一波牛市的开启都有它不一样的叙事方式，比如说上一轮的 ICO、这一轮的 Defi，如果下一轮大牛市在两年之后，那个时候叙事方式是从哪个领域出来，这个是很重要的。\n\n根据这个预测，我们可以反推一下有哪些东西还是欠缺的，尤其是在基础公链方面。我们作为散户很多时候是欠缺的，我们可以更加多地以来大 VC 的分析判断，他们经过了 N 多个牛熊的人，创始人是最早一批成功的人，同时扶持了大量的早期项目，所以我相信他们的感觉是比较准的。如果担心只依赖一个 VC 的眼光可能会出错，那可以看多个 VC 有没有共同押宝的赛道。\n\n目前现在大的 VC 都在投 web3。现在 web3 的雏形项目有一些欠缺的东西，第一个是钱包入口的易用性方面，第二个是很多项目在说的公链吞吐量并发量，第三个钱包安全也是非常头疼的问题，这是像 A16Z 等 VC 希望从这些方面能够在未来有所突破。\n\n至于说现在看到的比特币和以太，他们是两种不一样的资产类型，比特是共识堆积起来的价值存储方式，把它类比于黄金是现阶段比较好理解的；以太更多是生态建设催化剂的角色。这两者发展上脱钩是完全有可能的，目前币圈整个 TVL 还很小，如何能够真正吸引大资金进来，假设外汇交易市场有个 20%-50% 用区块链的方式去交易，成本更低效率更高，未来的数字货币市场就完全不一样了，体量是现在的 N 倍。到那种情况下，以太坊作为出圈的价值，潜力会更加大。\n\n**0x499**\n\n在 2021 年的牛市中，很多挑战以太坊的新公链获得了惊人的市值增长，个别公链比如 Solana 依靠链游的成功塑造了高性能的差异化定位，同时近期基于以太坊 Layer2 的项目代币热度很高，是否说明对于公链而言，高 TPS 和高可拓展性依然是支撑估值的关键？\n\n**潜水观察员（@connectfarm1）**\n\n我个人觉得 Layer2 现在是一个打问号的赛道。我没想明白为什么以太坊要转 2.0，更没想明白未来这么多公链有什么用。甚至不以成败论英雄的话，我觉得 ICP 和 Filecoin 提出的东西会更加 make sense 一点。所以终究这是一个情绪和预期主导的世界。比如大家之前说以太坊 2.0 是一个利空，这两天又是一个利好，过段时间又是一个利空。任何一个公链和底层技术都是随机性的，我们今天使用的互联网之前，在它之前可能由另一套协议表现更好，但是人类历史发展是由很多随机性组成的，我在想是不是以太坊当年出来的时候，在世界的另一个角落有一套智能合约技术和框架比以太坊优秀，只是恰好终于跑起来了。\n\n我觉得最重要的一点，是你的生态中究竟能吸引多少人口，如果你从这点来判断，甚至中国的联盟链都有机会。像前两天王老吉这种消费类巨头直接发 NFT，我们看到各种传统势力和巨头不断进来这个行业，最终胜出的未必是现在的以太坊，甚至未必是出自币圈。所以在我看来币圈长线命题不太成立。\n\n我们在思考 web3.0 投资的时候，会更多去想激励层而不是去中心化。比如说 DAO 有多大几率在未来会代替公司，而不是思考一个事情底层能去中心化成为一个什么东西。\n\n**Jimmy（@CryptosLaowai）**\n\n我觉得关键是公链的经济模型，比如 Solana 手续费非常低，但是需要通过无限制增发或者通货膨胀的方式 SOL 代币去给维护网络的节点，如果没有足够多的人去接盘的话，就很难维持价格坚挺。所以我觉得公链更多是 VC 的产物，它不是一个币圈原生的东西。\n\n下一个牛市肯定有 Layer1 故事可讲，在以太坊没有实现分片技术之前，以太坊是 VC 大面积踏空的一个项目，另外那些拿了 VC 钱的项目可能涨了一两轮就涨不动了，但是以太坊可以一直涨下去。这个可能也跟我自己的偏见有关，我在 17 年的时候投了 NEO，后来几乎归零。\n\n我非常同意 Bill 的观点，可以去看 VC 在做什么，我在上一轮牛市中买的币都是听一个 VC 朋友说的，所以大家看到团队特别好的项目可以在不怎么了解的时候，可以放很小的资金去买一点，然后设定一个一到两年的退出周期。\n\n相比于 Layer1，我更看好 Layer2，因为 Layer2 要比 Layer1 容易构建，尤其是 Optimisitic Layer2，比如某一个游戏完全可以把 OP 分叉一个，受益于以太坊的网络效应和安全性，所以 Layer2 会吸引特别多的资金过去。\n\n**0x499**\n\n其他一些板块，比如 NFT、GameFi、元宇宙概念的代币，在熊市结束之前有没有一些结构性投资机会？\n\n**Bill（Co-founder of DeCentralized VC）**\n\n熊市是最好的投资和建设时机，如果你在牛市或者牛市中后期再去投资，通常都会是一个韭菜。以这种投资理念来说，熊市是一个好机会。首先在熊市的时候，有些二级的价格要低于一级的价格，所以你作为一个散户，可以去割 VC 的韭菜，从这个方面来说无论是 NFT、GameFi 还是元宇宙，都可以在深熊的时候可以找到很好的标的。\n\n另外 NFT 项目和 NFT 平台是要区分来看的。图片的话在我看来觉得大多数都是归零的，每天 Opensea 上出来的项目太多了，压中的概率是非常小的，除非你真的把握住背后的团队和文化，一般散户在这方面是蛮难的。所以对 NFT 市场更加建议关注基础建设和工具类产品，熊市是一个最佳时机。比如说 GameFi 里面使用 NFT 的数量是最大的，比如说 Flow 承载了 100 个 NFT 项目，即便是大部分都死掉了，只有一两个跑出来，Flow 依然可以吃到项目增长的红利。\n\n第二个是可以找新的机会，做一级市场，我是传统投资做一级市场出来的，以前传统做一级失败的概率是很高的，但利润优势最丰厚的，如果你看准项目和团队，所以在熊市里面我不会放弃去找优质团队和项目的机会。一级的判断是相当难的，直接去做对方向、人的把握是挑战非常大的，我用的衡量标准就是找这些创业团队的发起人，要求至少在圈里面 4 年以上的连续创业者，选择的方向至少要符合下一个赛道有最大流量增长的那个，那我们就可以去搏一把，同时也要做好评估，不要把鸡蛋放在一个篮子里面，熊市的好处是估值比较低，一般你可以找市场影响力的 VC 一起投，每个 VC  的成本不会很高。\n\n熊市很长的时候，我们可以慢慢看，不像牛市的时候要在 24 小时内定下来，抢不到就没了。目前我手里面也有很多这样的团队，如果有些项目越到熊市越起劲，那你就要多给些关注的。所以这是二级和一级两种方法并用起来，在熊市中找投资机会的方法。\n\n**大君（加密分析师）**\n\n我认为 GameFi 还是有非常大的机会，去年 VC 大概一共往 GameFi 赛道投了 40 亿，现在是 100 亿。我最近也在做一个 GameFi 的 IGO，可以看到整个游戏页面和画质都比之前有很大增长，这些项目的一级打新还是有一定机会的。\n\n另外 NFT 我研究了一些巨鲸，他们基本上人手 3000 多个甚至 1w 个都有，现在玩法还是以土狗为先，大户是能够拿出一些现金流来玩 NFT 的，比如说 30 个 ETH，最后拿到 150-180 ETH，这种情况是存在的。但是 NFT 玩家基本都是长期 holder，基本都是 46 天以上，因为 NFT 流动性是要挂单拍卖。\n\n其他我看到行业里面一些赚钱机会，一个是元宇宙，即便是在熊市里面也是能够发光发热。当然也有一些别的，比如说空投的 OP 等等。所以熊市里面也会有很多一级的机会，该赚钱的还是会赚钱，但肯定是要大浪淘沙，一定要沉下心来看。\n\n\n---\n\n```\n                                 END

{"id": "_1de5REgiEpQrdii8LKRHVEAnW5LgHfJ87WSvcyIw1w", "title": "merchandising related to clothing", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aVVCkcoOvHucmYbtg99y5.png?height=270&width=397)\n\nRecently I saw such a story in Wang Xiaobo's \"The Silent Majority\": It is said that before the Three Kingdoms, Yunnan was full of coconuts. The locals can eat coconut shredded rice, and coconut oil can also be eaten. The fibers in the coconut leaves can weave rough dresses, while the trunk of the coconut tree is wood. This tree can meet most of people's daily needs. One day Zhuge Liang led his troops to this point. He wanted to educate the local people, so he let them live in our way, sow in spring and harvest in autumn, wear our clothes, and obey our system.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LD9pm5YjINX4vHWNH1L5p.png?height=266&width=432)\n\nFarming is much more difficult than picking ready-made coconuts. This seemingly superior system is not very superior to the locals, so it is difficult to implement until Zhuge Liang felt that it would not work to educate only by talking, so It was ordered to cut down all the coconut trees in Yunnan, which forced people to follow such a troublesome way of life.\n\nOf course, this is just a rumor. I don't know, and I don't really believe it, whether Zhuge Liang, who is a sage of a generation, will nakedly threaten the ignorant people with force. But from this incident, I can detect a phenomenon that often occurs around me: others always try to convince me with their own ideas or doctrines, forcing me to join their camp. And when I showed a little bit of disinterest, or even the slightest tendency to disapprove, others would show disgust and say, \"Why are you like this!\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ws5BRKU94XhVXAob1CVGI.png?height=270&width=424)\n\nOf course, this is just my fantasy when I stare at other people's disappointed eyes, but the loneliness on the other's face is real and can be seen. Whenever this happens, I always have a tangle in my heart: I can't bear to see others feel unhappy because of me, but I can't accept opinions that are contrary to my own considerations. The final compromise is to have to deal with each other verbally, but inwardly cursing, but who is cursing? It’s not about scolding yourself, and it’s not about scolding others. Feeling extremely depressed in the chest.\n\nAfter so many experiences like this, I slowly learned to be good. I also stopped talking in public, and I avoided arguing with people in private. Change the subject as soon as you see signs of it. In doing so, I am truly one of the silent ones, but one of the few, not the majority, of my surroundings.\n\nWhen I was in my twenties, I was obviously still a teenager, but after being so restrained, I had to resist. I don't consider myself an uncivilized barbarian, but even barbarians are unwilling to be educated by the so-called Central Plains people, not to mention that the gap between you and me is as big as a tractor and an old ox pulling a cart? Who will assess this gap?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_VO8nQhfagw3XQYE8bQSz.png?height=270&width=396)\n\nWho the hell gave them the right to replace my leaves with silk? The answer is themselves. I always think that my own thoughts are superior to others, so no matter whether others like it or not, I always want to put it on others. In Wang Xiaobo's words, although the material is good, \"it can't cover sweat and prickly heat when wearing it on the body\". If your theory is really that good, but I don't think it conforms to my actual situation, I might as well not listen to it, so why bother pretending to be worried and superior in an attempt to convince me. Doing nothing to change the tricks about clothes, wearing front and back, and then looking for people to sell them all over the street. And this is the side business that many people who have read books are keen on today. Fortunately, they know it is a side business. After all, they still don't know how to \"make it clear\". Stop and try on clothes. Otherwise, some people will have to be forced into the Castle Peak.\n\nLooking at the long history, literati have learned this kind of sales since the birth of Confucius, and Mencius developed it to a climax. The phrase \"no father and no king is a beast\", I don't know how many people are embarrassed to talk. During the Cultural Revolution, it developed to the extreme, and people no longer had to try on clothes, because there is only one piece of clothing to wear today, and thinking about the other is not just ignorant, but reactionary.\n\nHaving said that, in order to do a prosperous business, in addition to having good salesmen, customers who are easily impressed are of course essential. Elliott Aronson mentioned in his \"Social Animals\" that conformity refers to changes in people's behavior or opinions caused by real or imagined pressures on a person or a group. Born in this land where harmony is the most important thing, we have a great environment for conforming to the crowd. Do you agree with this view? It just so happens that I am too, so we are confidants. Let's go, let's have a drink! Are you against that view? It doesn't matter, me too. Let's go, let's have a drink! This wine is indeed a good thing. After two or three glasses, people can trust each other, but it is unknown what the situation will be when he wakes up the next day.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that it's easy to agree or disagree with an opinion under pressure from others around you, especially if the pressurer is some authority or someone close to you. So we often see that when two literati are arguing somewhere, there is always a large group of unreasonable people behind them who act as speakers. If you ask him why he is on this side, he will tell you that this person is reasonable, but when you ask what this principle is, people always like to go around and talk for a long time, from outer space to the inner womb, The final conclusion is: This man is right! Listeners will feel that this person knows astronomy and geography, but it is unclear whether there is a necessary connection with this principle. If there are too many people saying this, you will inevitably feel dizzy, and finally make yourself want to jump into the ring of fire with honor and shout: This person is right!", "timestamp": 1658293724, "digest": "QUxkfAgHcLbooOLlEQv2TYYKyzl6bP4W1me3D9v7aMY", "contributor": "0xD356d298dbCf1B3a598A8dcdbBa193c5B4D85684"}

[해당 NFT](https://nftgo.io/ko/asset/ETH/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/3356)의 최근 판매는 2021년 5월이었다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u_1K0hGc3gvgJSBHxLf4C.png?height=952&width=1780)\n\n그후 시장이 급변하며 BAYC의 가치가 상승했다. BAYC의 최저가는 현재 93ETH이다. 해당 NFT의 최근 판매가격은 현재 시장 평가액의 3%도 채 반영하지 못하고 있다.\n\nNFT 가격의 변동성을 고려하기 때문에 포트폴리오 성과를 분석할시 하나의 측정 기준을 더 포함시켰다. 해당 메트릭을 추정 보유 값이라고 한다. 포트폴리오의 추정 가치를 계산하는 공식은 아래와 같다.\n\n`EST 값 = 총 NFT 수 max (평균, 바닥)`\n\n일별 및 주별로 추정치 변동을 추적한다.\n\n추정된 미실현 이익 지표는 성과 평가의 또 다른 주요 지표이다. 해당 메트릭은 추정된 고정 값과 고정 값 사이의 차이다.\n\n### 활동 메트릭\n\n활동에는 주소의 판매, 민팅, 소각, 이전 및 구매 활동이 포함된다.\n\n주소의 구매량은 주소에서 가져온 모든 NFT의 합계이다. 이와 유사하게, 판매량은 주소의 판매활동을 모두 합산한다. 둘 다 일별 및 주별로 변경 내용을 표시한다.\n\n이익은 매수량과 매도량의 차액이다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g5xY_FtGKyLyX0NhDzTek.png?height=552&width=2040)\n\n## 통계\n\n통계는 주소의 포트폴리오에 대한 포괄적인 스냅샷을 제공한다. 해당 기능을 통해 많은 통찰을얻을 수 있다. 통계 섹션에는 다음 그래프들이 포함된다.\n\n* 보유분포\n* 홀딩 트렌드\n* 거래 매입 및 판매\n* 관련 주소\n* 컬렉션\n* **보유분포**\n\n보유 분포 그래프는 컬렉션에서 NFT 보유의 숫자 비율을 사용하여 포트폴리오 다양성을 보여준다. 포트폴리오 다변화 분석은 투자자들에게 잠재적인 위험을 알리며 이에 위험회피를 하는데 도움을 준다. 아래에서는 다향한 NFT 개수를 가진 포트폴리오들을 볼 수 있다. 아래 포트폴리오를 예로 들어보자. 보유 가치 분배의 관점에서, 해당 포토폴리도의 대부분 가치는 [판타지 아일랜드 - 샌드박스](https://nftgo.io/ko/collection/fantasy-islands---sandbox/overview)에서 비롯된다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vve8TSk7Y81UTjGCpU0Yn.png?height=692&width=1688)\n\n아래 포트폴리오는 수익성 있는 NFT 컬렉션의 힘을 보여준다. 해당 주소의 지분은 대부분 [아트 블록](https://nftgo.io/ko/collection/art-blocks/overview)으로, NFT 수에서 전체 지분의 84% 이상을 차지한다.\n\n반면 그가 보유한 [크립토펑크](https://nftgo.io/ko/collection/cryptopunks/overview)는 포트폴리오 추정 가치의 98.83%를 차지하며 아트블록스는 1% 미만의 놀라운 점유율을 기록하고 있어 주소의 수익 증가가 크립토펑크의 빠른 성장세에 따른 것임이 반영됐다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3qXNRHPZ92B_I3jCQ-kQT.png?height=812&width=2198)\n\n### 홀딩 트렌드\n\n트렌드 분석은 데이터 중심 의사 결정의 가장 중요한 측면 중 하나다. 홀딩 트렌드 그래프는 세 가지 메트릭을 표시한다.\n\n* 보유가치\n* Est 홀딩 가치\n* Est URP\n\n개요 섹션에서 말했듯이 [이곳에서](https://nftgo.io/ko/account/ETH/0x2e675eeae4747c248bfddbafaa3a8a2fdddaa44b/stats) 추정된 미실현 이익의 상승 보유 추세를 볼 수 있다. 이는 하나 또는 여러 개의 수익성이 높은 NFT 컬렉션에 조기 진입했음을 나타낸다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hSINKNsM_ZK-CnmCZV9Lb.png?height=856&width=1250)\n\n한편, [해당 그래프](https://nftgo.io/ko/account/ETH/0x4fbede53b59d1a2ab85f785ad76e1dcd66a1546a/NFT)를 통해 고정 값과 Est 고정 값 사이의 유사한 관계를 볼 수 있다. 이 또한 Est URP의 꾸준한 추세와 함께 온다. 그후, 보유 가치가 여전히 상승하고 있는 반면 미실현 수익이 3천 2백만 달러 아래로 크게 떨어지는 것을 볼 수 있다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hkJyDqryYFK69Gjf9_brM.png?height=874&width=1230)\n\n보유 가치는 마지막 판매 가격의 합이며 종종 현재의 시장 가치를 반영하지 않는다는 것을 잊어서는 안된다. 가격이 급등하면 시장은 가격 조정 메커니즘을 따른다. 자산은 공정가치를 반영하기 시작한다. 세 가지 측정 기준을 비교하여 서로 다른 자산 시나리오와 그래프를 보며 분석할 수 있다.\n\n### 관련 주소\n\n해당 업그레이드는 트랜잭션에 의한 상호 작용 빈도를 기반으로 관련 주소를 찾기 위한 NFTGo.io의 새로운 솔루션중 일부이다. 대부분의 고래들은 두 개 이상의 주소로 활동한다. 어떤 고래들은 특정 NFT를 위한 금고를 가지고 있고 다른 고래들은 특정 주소를 거래/보관하고 있다. 모든 관련 주소를 수동으로 추적하기는 어렵다. 이에 온라인 데이터를 활용하여 이를 자동화했다. 관계형 그래프를 사용하여 가장 관련성이 높은 주소를 계산하고 두 가지 방법으로 데이터를 표시할 수 있었다.\n\n* 테이블\n* 그래프\n\n데이터에는 각 수신/송신 이벤트의 범위와 해당 주소에 대한 자세한 정보와 마지막 전송 날짜가 포함된다. 계약은 📄로, 고래는 🐋로 표시된다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rS8r2uLWBh-xhiIPEsrWM.png?height=908&width=1242)\n\n아래는 [micman.eth](https://nftgo.io/ko/account/ETH/0x5858d523dca58049f68bc5df579dc8444bc11743/stats)의 상위 관련 주소다. 대부분의 이전은 [해당 주소](https://nftgo.io/ko/account/ETH/0x371f4c6fd305c6772bc6224b795b0b46b6b6f8db/stats)로 이루어진다. 이는 그들의 샌드박스 NFT의 금고 역할을 하는 계약이다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rHCCLkQSZNl425mqNh5F5.png?height=888&width=1198)\n\n그래프 뷰는 전송 데이터에 대한 보다 시각적이고 일반적인 표현 방식으로, 이전과 관련된 다른 주소 간의 관계를 보여준다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Auyl_HpIgkwc91Iike65_.png?height=838&width=1250)\n\n### 컬렉션\n\n컬렉션 섹션은 주소가 보유한 다양한 컬렉션에 대한 자세한 표다. 이는 어떤 NFT 프로젝트가 주로 주소의 손익에 기여했는지 더 자세히 보여준다.\n\n## 추적 활동\n\n활동 추적 또한 포트폴리오 분석을 위한 중요한 도구다. 주소의 모든 활동에 대한 시각적 가이드를 제공한다. 아래는 [모 활동 경향의 막대 차트](https://nftgo.io/ko/account/ETH/0xe67b18b27db897ff71994a6ad3890626620e580a/stats)다. 활동 경향을 분석할 때 고려해야 할 데이터 포인트는 민팅, 구매, 판매, 소각, 보내기, 받기가 있다. 이는 모두 해당 그래프에 반영된다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Mhpp0EhUyrxctVoP--SOq.png?height=574&width=1442)\n\n그래프는 각 활동의 양과 모든 활동을 살폈을 때 선택된 시간 범위에서 해당 활동의 우위성을 나타낸다. 도표는 전반적으로 해당 주소가 훨씬 더 큰 규모로 구매되는 경향이 있음을 보여준다.\n\n해당 계정의 [관련 주소](https://nftgo.io/ko/account/ETH/0x90ee3cf59fcde2fe11838b9075ea4681462362f1/activity)를 조사함으로써 가장 많은 송수신 트랜잭션이 있는 계약 주소를 찾을 수 있었다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tiSEDiBg0e3nj-CHbeFGq.png?height=1020&width=1388)\n\n해당 계약의 활동 차트를 들여다보면, 해당 계약이 해당 고래 주소에 대한 또 다른 \"금고\" 역할을 한다는 것을 알 수 있다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UoHwXTEIvdROhpDP5UI2R.png?height=558&width=1416)\n\n해당 기능을 사용하면 주소의 기능과 합법성을 빠르고 쉽게 구별할 수 있다.\n\n또한 선택한 기간 동안 주소의 모든 활동에 대한 후속 세부 정보를 볼 수 있는 버전도 있다.\n\n![데이터 출처: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m-MMn50HbGou5LE9tYfEl.png?height=62&width=1420)\n\n옵션을 사용하면 결정에 가장 영향을 미치는 데이터를 정렬할 수 있다.

@whales_010\n\n特定历史时期的不同社会中，并存着不同的群体和生产关系，它们看似自发形成的不同生存经验和秩序规则之中包含着的价值基础，并不能简单的用一种外在性的先验视角去创制，先验的创制办法往往会带来价值冲突甚至极端对立的境地，企图用理性世界去支配感性世界的方法不能容纳所有的个体和实际，对于 Web3 背景下的 DAO 治理模式而言亦是如此。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/72KNsIl.png)\n\n## 一、价值基础的转向\n\n在人类社会变革的过程中，社会整体始终保持着超出现状的诉求，这个诉求在不断变化，其所蕴含的价值基础被不断地扩充，从基本的「生存」到「自由、平等」再到今天的丰富内容，它的外延不断地拓展，但究其原因，并不能简单的用「应然」去应付，这种外在性的价值基础并不能用来调整和规范所有的生存方式。\n\n### 1.1 外在性价值基础的失效\n\n**传统形而上学将世界分为了理性世界和感性世界，希望用理性世界去支配感性世界。** 同时将身体和意识剥离开来，并强调意识的先导性，即「在纯粹身体和纯粹心灵的二分中抑身扬心」，用先验的视角把超验的世界构想为最真实的世界及理想化的评判准绳。这种外在、超验视角下的价值基础及评判标准曾在西方思想史上占据主导地位，**从柏拉图到黑格尔，再到边沁和康德，都是在以这种方式将价值基础归于理性的推演**，并基于此预设标准用以调整人类的生存方式，**但这种标准一定程度上并不具有普适性，换言之，这就是外在性价值的失效**。\n\n在「电车难题」中，同样的「五条生命对一条生命」，我们预设的价值基础不具有普适性，举重以明轻，在 Web3 的 DAO 治理模式中，这种预设性的价值基础同样不具有普适性，不论是边沁的功利主义（要欢愉不要痛苦，为了整体的、更多的福利），还是以康德为代表的绝对主义价值观（从评判的视角，将理性作为道德的基础，将价值基础建立在人类的理性之上，用价值基础充当评判行为的原则），对于五条生命对一条生命的选择问题上尚且存在着极端对立的情况，更遑论基于不同群体间的共识竞合而衍生的纷繁的行为方式？\n\n### 1.2 内在性价值基础的兴起\n\n内在价值论的后现代转向，颠覆了绝对主义价值观，以德勒兹为代表的后现代主义哲学家认为，人类的生存经验才是价值基础。他搭建起价值基础与人类的经验的桥梁，使人类的生存模式成为创造新价值的基石。这一内在性的视角明显区别于康德的超验哲学，**德勒兹认为人类的生存经验才是价值基础的真正起源，强调应当从人类经验本身出发评断人类的行为**。而外在的评判准绳被具象为价值观中的怜悯、仁慈、平等、善良等，它们被寄予期待去束缚强者的生命本能，但这些价值的背后都是一段段奴隶推翻主人的故事，**这些价值站在奴隶的立场，基于奴隶的思维模式**。\n\n以「权力意志」为例，权力意志并不是狭隘的局限于对权力的追求和渴望，它本身反映的是主体的生命本能，而权力本身不存在，是奴隶眼中的主人所拥有的，奴隶希望自己被表象为主人，拥有主人所拥有的所谓权力，这是奴隶的诉求，但也只是奴隶的诉求，正如「奴隶并不因获得权力就不再是奴隶」，奴隶所追求并实现的诉求并不是所有共同体的诉求，只是奴隶为了奴隶本身的利益自己构想的价值基础。**传统形而上学所推崇的价值观是弱者、奴隶的思维模式，这种思维模式下创制的价值基础是为了去束缚强者**：\n\n* 一方面，**这种思维模式割裂了所有共同体**，只是基于奴隶的立场和利益，并抛弃了处于奴隶对立面的主人的立场和利益。\n* 另一方面，**基于身体主导的主人价值观认为身体就是全部**，「上帝、理性、自我意识」都不是价值基础的根源，换句话说，我们每个人都是自己的主人，不必为他人使自己表象为他人意识中的主人，故而**支配自己的所有系理所应当的道理，这一点覆盖了当前 Web3 对于「所有权」的共识**。\n\n如此看，DAO 治理模式之价值基础并非基于奴隶价值以向强者控诉，而是在一片混沌中不拘于传统形而上学之束缚而自成各自的元宇宙、并相互交织。**相比于奴隶价值观，这种主人价值观更具有普适性，它把价值基础的根基奠定在现实客观的人类生存经验之中**，这里的现实客观广义的将所有的共同体都涵盖在其中，并不局限于 Web3，故而从内在性的视角去看待价值的根源和形成，这种方式更具有科学性和实质性，也具有价值基础从外在性向内在性转向的说服力。\n\n## 二、价值基础的根基\n\n后现代主义哲学家们虽然抹开笼罩在价值基础上的虚无主义的面纱，但是在生存经验之下应该还存在着更根源性的，更原始的驱动力去推进价值基础的变迁，它一方面在微观上体现为不同的个体基于生命本能的自行决断，另一方面在宏观上表征为人类社会在各种力求相互承认相互倾轧的合力之下逐渐形成的公允标准。\n\n### 2.1 根基之生命本能\n\n后现代主义哲学认为将现实生活和经验作为价值基础，同时指出秩序也并非恒古不变，它一并随着人类的生存经验作出调整，所有的价值基础都内在于人类的现实生活。但生存经验本身也并非价值无涉，**人类的现实生活对同一人类经验的内在性价值基础的同一性无从保证**，需要注意的是，我们并不需要一个无涉的价值评判标准，我们抛弃超验视角下的外在性的价值基础是因为它完全割裂了主观世界，而对于「谁去评判」的问题，既不应是我们预先设置的道德标准也不应是单纯的人类经验，应该是追根溯源到生命本能，人类基于生命本能不断调整自己的生存方式以积累生存经验，上升到不同群体间的生存经验的竞合，再到所有共同体间的价值基础的竞合。\n\n以古希腊的思想自由起源为例，希腊是位于地中海且占地面积不大的半岛，因可用耕地少且耕地条件差，所以并不能为古希腊人民提供良好的农业生产环境，他们只能另辟蹊径去解决基本的生存问题，比如发展加工业、航海业等其他产业,这就使得希腊的社会经济结构逐渐由原始的自然经济向商品经济转化，这是希腊人在客观的现实条件下满怀对美好生活的主观向往对生存方式进行的改变，也是新的生存经验的创制，其背后反映的是基于基本的生命本能，而它附带的则是普遍而广泛的商品交换和货币经济的兴起,这就使得当时繁盛的独裁、专制、血缘政治开始与这股大的历史潮流格格不入，「希腊人民为了生存必须以民事主体自由、平等的身份为前提, 必须推翻与之相违的身份、特权」，它反映的是生产关系、生存经验改变的过程中，社会各阶级的利益对立和统一，另一方面,自由在生存经验的竞合下作为新的价值基础应运而生。\n\n生命本能毫无疑问不会站在中立立场，它相对而言带有相对强烈的主观色彩，另一方面它又包含着相比于它的主观色彩权重较大的客观性，这部分客观性是具有历史性的、规律性的，这部分客观性反映着人类社会进步的事实，如此看来，生命本能本身带有的这部分主观性不仅容纳了共同体主观性和现实客观性，并在此基础上对生存方式本身造成影响，甚至改变了所有共同体的生存经验，以至于对价值基础本身进行重新建构。\n\n### 2.2 根基之目的、利益\n\n在特定历史时期的社会中，**不同群体的生存经验和生产方式是不同的，它们来自不同主体在利益、目的驱动下的生命本能的竞合**，生命本能是基于人最原始、最基本的目的、利益产生的，而利益本身具有广泛性，按照赫克的观点，在一切社会中相互竞争的个人利益与集体利益都属于这个概念的范畴。这里可以从微观和宏观两个角度来看，从微观的角度来说，即对于个体来讲，目的和利益是他参与社会竞争的驱动力，这其中既包括该个体与其他客体的竞争，也包括该个体自我的竞争；而从宏观的角度来看，即对于整个社会乃至整个种族而言，目的和利益又是这个社会和种族参与自然竞争的驱动力。\n\n在德勒兹关于欲望的论述中，德勒兹和瓜塔里提出「欲望是基础设施的一部分」他们采用马克思的理论概念，同时对资本主义的运转作出了新的定义，认为物质生产的根本动力是欲望的生产，即**通过欲望的生产推动生产关系以及上层建筑的改变**，所以基于这一点出发，或许可以说物质生产的根本动力是目的、利益，而生产关系和上层建筑的改变，也是基于这点。\n\n生产关系、上层建筑的改变只是外壳的改变，除开本源的利益作为驱动力以外，还需要其他的中间力量去填充它的血肉，例如物质、民族、宗教和伦理等方面的支撑，在赫克和耶林所奠定的利益法学中的核心提到「法律是所有共同体相互对峙且为得到承认而相互争斗的物质、民族、宗教和伦理等方面的利益的合力」，而物质、民族、宗教和伦理正是上述的人类的生存经验的部分，法律象征着秩序和规则，在秩序和规则背后反映着价值基础的判断和取舍，在利益法学的视域下，从内在的角度来看，这句话就变成了**价值基础是所有人类共同体中相互对峙且为得到承认而相互争斗的基于生命本能的生存经验的合力**。\n\n## 三、价值基础的私利性\n\n马克思和恩格斯曾经说道：「……利益……将市民社会的成员联系在一起」。列宁认为，一切会现象都要「追溯到特定阶级的利益」。施坦因曾认识到：「利益是社会的原则」。19 世纪中期在全世界范围内发生的社会变革，在这个特殊的历史时期的哲学家试图从社会现象去寻找价值基础，并在这个过程中开始重视起经济、政治、社会与秩序之间的多元的联系，而**在几乎所有的社会阶级和社会原则等方面的论述中，「利益」一词频频出现**。\n\n耶林在 1872 年所作的《为权利而斗争》中深刻的指出，「法是权利行使和利益保护的工具」。法具有工具性，而工具本身没有价值基础可言，它的价值基础是使用和创造这个工具的人赋予的，希望能以它达到某种目的，马克思评价这个价值基础是服务于占统治地位的社会阶级的利益，这句话要一体两面的分析，一方面，去掉这句话的定语，**价值基础服务于利益**，另一方面，**在 DAO 治理中，统治阶级等身份的概念被淡化，权力通过合约等方式被赋予给每一位成员，故而在 DAO 治理中，价值基础所服务的主体至少在理论上切实服务了所有共同体**。\n\n### 3.1 社会共识中价值基础的私利性\n\n趋利避害是人之本性，在社会中，个体无法脱离社会，无法避免与其他人产生交集，尤其是在追求个人利益的过程中，会普遍的出现为自己谋取利益的同时也为社会谋取了利益，也就是**个人的「私利」向社会的「公益」转化**，这一点在 DAO 治理中同样也体现在个体利益与 DAO 组织利益的共振。这种现象在经济活动中体现的尤为明显，附随的是习惯和秩序，尽管它从结果上看是社会繁荣、秩序井然的原因，但本质上依旧是基于利益出发，具有很强的私利性。\n\n> 在社会发展某个很早的阶段，产生了这样一种需要：把每天重复着的产品生产、分配和交换用一个共同规则约束起来，借以使个人服从生产和交换的共同条件。这个规则首先表现为习惯，不久便成了法律。\n> ——恩格斯\n\n其中产品的生产、分配和交换在社会发展中体现着生产关系的发展，规则又分为两个阶段，即习惯和法律，而习惯反映的是社会共识，与生产关系进行相互影响和双向调整，在习惯经受住各种利益竞合的考验和冲突后，它被赋予价值基础并不断扩充，这个共识才有资格成为规则去约束处于这个生产关系中的共同体的行为并逐渐成为秩序。在生产关系的作用下，人们在过程中积累流传下来习惯、惯例和传统，并成为社会共识，这些社会共识是通过追求各自目标的个人行为的结合，最根本的还是利益的竞合，利益作为驱动力推动着规则和秩序的发展，推动着价值基础的变革。\n\n在以物易物的早期人类经济活动中，没有固定统一的交换媒介，而因为众多人易物需求的不同，恰好符合交易需求和条件的情况并不多见，「为了能更加顺利地交换到自己恰好需要的东西或者使得自己的货物能得到更多的交换从而实现更多人的交换目的」，一种在物理上具有稳定性、在时空上具有任意性、在交易中具有便捷性的中介物就成了在这个经济活动中的所有共同体迫切需要的，从有这个需要到这个中介物的产生还有一段过程，当这个经济活动的某次交易中，其中单个或多个主体拥有其他主体的需求交集的货物时，他们理所应当能够与其他人进行更多的交易。而随着这种情况和次数的增加，大家慢慢注意到这种情况，于是为了获取同样的利益，占有类似同样的优势，模仿和学习就发生了，随着时间推移，这种受欢迎的货物的使用价值慢慢被它的其他价值替代，只是因为其更加方便的进行交易，在交易活动中的人们会更加广泛的接受它作为交易活动的中介物，而此时这个中介物的产生就进入了下一个阶段，即遴选淘汰的阶段，因为伴随着对中介物需求的不断增加，它要面临更多利益的竞合，直观反映的结果就是中介物种类的急剧减少，直到最后某种或某几种被保留下来，成了货币。\n\n这种非刻意安排的无组织行为形成了一种对在这个交易活动中的所有共同体都构成约束力的共识，督促着他们按照统一的办法去采取行为，这也是最早期的货币制度，货币的起源体现了制度的约束力和人们基于利益采取一切行为的本质特征。\n\n### 3.2 社会秩序中价值基础的私利性\n\n每个人都只能掌握社会知识总量中的一小部分，这部分相对于整个人类社会而言是微不足道的，在很大程度上，他们还是无知的，他们短暂有限的生命里所攫取的有限的理性与人类社会的浩瀚如烟、纷繁庞大比起来过于渺小，而正是因为社会知识的庞大和人类所掌握知识的渺小，所以无法在先验的视角下去建构社会秩序，它必须要容纳事实和环境，而这些是单单凭理性所无法认知和理解把握的。「任何自然状态的存在都不是先验的」，不论是社会制度的发展还是科学技术知识的增进等等，正如上述货币的起源，原始社会的交易参与者对于货币毫无概念，也无从意识到创造货币的行为，他们只是单纯的基于利益去采取行为，并在共识中产生了具有约束力的规则，形成了秩序，这个社会秩序的创制过程是循序渐进的实践过程的产物，一方面它包含着生存经验和社会共识，另一方面它带着明显的自发性，并非基于理性构建，而是纯粹的在追求个人利益时所形成，这种**自发性的秩序相比外力设置的预设性规则更能有效的保护人们的利益**，因为外力设置的预设性规则并不能洞察所有人所处的境遇，而**自发性的秩序是基于所有共同体的利益合力形成的**。\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qQbYvPJ.jpg)\n\n一个社会的现行秩序能否在利益冲突的压力下免于崩溃，要以现行生产关系是否仍然具有历史合理性为决定性条件。到这里，其实呈现在我们面前的是**利益、生产关系和秩序价值的三角循环递进上升的动态关系图**，在不同时空中，容纳了理性和实际的生产关系基于所有共同体的利益出发形成了社会秩序，而其价值基础再从利益出发衍生出更高一层的生产关系，继而有了新的利益和新的价值基础，如此往复，而推动它们这样螺旋式上升递进的原始动力仅仅是利益而已，这也是 DAO 治理与 Fi 存在高度适配性的原因之一。\n\n## 四、结论\n\n虔诚迎接元宇宙到来的我们，或应自成各自的元宇宙而相互交互，利益作为本源和驱动力，推动着整个生态的发展、秩序建构和价值基础创制，反哺并与传统产业及现实社会共振，当我们真正考虑所有共同体所遭遇的境遇，摆在我们面前的是赤裸裸的、实质的利益竞合问题，而不是理想、基于理性构建的道德教化，「应然」本身的先验性与主观倾向性使其做不到「中立」，价值基础本身无法用逻辑推理去创制，更需要注意的是去规避使用外在性的评判标准，在我们的 Web3 进程中，让共识充分的竞合，**让 DAO 治理在目的和利益的竞合中自行成长，形成其本身的原生态规则、约束力和价值基础**。\n\n参考文献\n一、著作类\n\\[1\\].\\[德\\]魏德士.法理学\\[M\\],丁晓春,吴越译,北京:法律出版社,2013年版,第232-241页.\n\\[2\\].张文显.法理学\\[M\\].北京:高等教育出版社,2011年版,第260-262页.\n\\[3\\].《马克思恩格斯选集》第3卷\\[M\\].北京:人民出版社,1995年版,第211页.\n\\[4\\].杨大春.语言·身体·他者:当代法国哲学的三大主题\\[M\\].北京:三联书店,2007年版,第125页.\n\\[5\\]\\[英\\]哈耶克.经济、科学与政治——哈耶克论文演讲集\\[M\\],冯克利译,江苏人民出版社,2003年版,第593页. \n\\[6\\]梁峰.知识与自由—哈耶克政治哲学研究\\[M\\],北京:知识产权出版社,2007年版,第51页.\n\\[7\\].Gilles

But what does it mean to put all your energy into it?\n\nA story of \"Children Moving Stones\" may make people feel.\n\nA wise father and his 7-year-old son were tidying up their back garden when they came across a large rock buried in the soil. The father felt that this was a good opportunity to educate the child, so he asked the child to remove the big stone by himself.\n\nThe child pushed the stone for a long time, but the stone still didn't move, so he cleverly dug a hole next to it, found a log and inserted it into the hole, put another small stone under it, and tried to pry it up, but the big stone still didn't move. . Obviously, his strength is not enough to move the big stone.\n\nThe child told the father that he couldn't move, and the father could see it clearly, but still said coldly that you had to do your best.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ea3Tt_WUXDJzaGeFfRELw.png?height=266&width=467)\n\nThis time, the child used all his strength, and his face was flushed red. Afterwards, he put his entire body weight on the wood, and the stone remained motionless. The child gasped and sat down slumped.\n\nThe father approached him kindly and asked, \"Are you sure you really did your best?\" The child said of course it did.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MdIOtoKJg_2SwhyYWToxX.png?height=266&width=460)\n\nThen the father gently took the child's little hand and said, \"No, son, you haven't done your best. I'm right next to you, but you haven't asked me for help.\"\n\nDo your best, not only with your own strength, but also with external force. This is still the case for children moving stones, not to mention the struggles of all living beings.\n\nWith the development of society so far, there are inextricably linked relationships between people, and it is difficult for anyone to live in isolation in this world. Good at seeking help, with the help of external forces, often for self-interest and others. Furthermore, \"gold is not pure, and no man is perfect.\" With the help of external forces, he can make up for his own shortcomings. A person who fights alone, no matter how great his ability is, will not be able to achieve real success.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s3FjpeUrFhRPMXXe2cuuj.png?height=280&width=415)\n\nXunzi's \"Encouraging Learning\" has this sentence: \"When you climb high and move, your arms will not be lengthened, but you will be far away; if you call down the wind, your voice will not be sicker, but you will hear it. Those who fake horses do not benefit feet. And it will lead to thousands of miles; those who are fake boats are not capable of water, but they are not capable of rivers.\n\nBeing diligent and eager to learn is not only about finding a needle and being brave in self-exploration, but also knowing how not to be ashamed to ask questions and ask for advice with an open mind.\n\nBeing proactive means not only being diligent and dedicated, but also knowing how to learn from the experience of predecessors and gather the wisdom of others.\n\nEvery effort in life can actually be associated with the help of external forces.\n\nIn ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, success with the help of external forces can be found everywhere. With the help of Galileo's theory, Newton created Newtonian mechanics. With the help of Zhang Liang's strategy and Han Xin's strategy of leading troops, Liu Bang, the great ancestor of the Han Dynasty, achieved the great Han Dynasty.\n\nIn nature, there is no lack of success with the help of external forces. The bright moon illuminates the night with the help of sunlight; the ivy shows itself with the help of the fence.\n\nArchimedes has a famous saying: \"Give me a fulcrum, and I can pry up the earth.\" This fulcrum is with the help of external force.\n\nA person who knows how to use external force is a wise man in life. The wise have the greatest chance of success.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_pyFuP6VSXrUvFt9YaMXe.png?height=276&width=442)\n\nOf course, relying on external force is not a force to seize, but to move according to the situation, to take advantage of wisdom, not to hurt people or damage, and to maximize one's own intelligence.\n\nLearn to use external force, don't think that exhausting your own strength is called going all out.", "timestamp": 1658294600, "digest": "bzkKz2Dvz5womqEop3mI1FE-2A25RWnHo6TqoPzqDWw", "contributor": "0xD356d298dbCf1B3a598A8dcdbBa193c5B4D85684"}

3 级）。每个用户有四个神秘盒子插槽。神秘盒子有 10 种品质。收到神秘盒子后，倒计时会自动开始。当倒计时结束时，用户会花费少量 $GST（“基本成本”）来打开它。倒计时持续时间随着神秘盒子的质量而增加。\n\n运动鞋质量\n\n运动鞋有五种品质（普通、罕见、稀有、史诗和传奇）。铸造运动鞋时，每个属性的值都是在运动鞋质量决定的最小值和最大值之间随机选择的。因此，即使是相同品质的 Sneaker，也可能有着明显不同的属性等级。当达到某些里程碑时，用户需要消耗 $GMT 来升级他们的运动鞋。\n\n‍ 制鞋业\n\n在造鞋活动 (SME) 期间，用户使用他们拥有的两个运动鞋作为蓝图来“繁殖”，创建一个鞋盒。作为参考，这两款 Sneaker 将被称为 Vintages（父母）。\n\n为了开始 SME，两个 Vintage 都必须由用户拥有（非租用）并且完全耐用。然后，用户可以通过访问 Mint 选项卡、选择 Sneaker 并按下 Mint 来选择要“繁殖”的 Sneaker。两种年份都有 72 小时的铸币冷却时间，但在此期间它们仍可用于移动。在此处了解铸币成本。\n\n来源 ‍\n\n游戏模式 独奏模式\n\n用户通过穿着 NFT 运动鞋在单人模式中赚取代币。需要能源才能赚取 $GST。只有在用户获得 NFT 运动鞋后才会补充能量：1 能量等于 5 分钟的 Move-to-Earn 运动。\n\n马拉松模式（开发中）\n\n马拉松模式要求用户提前 24 小时在 Marathon Tab 下注册。马拉松将每周和每月举行一次。在此处了解有关每周马拉松和每月马拉松的更多信息。\n\n‍\n\n市场低迷影响STEPN\nSTEPN 代币的价格随着整体熊市而下跌，因为治理代币和实用代币均较今年早些时候的历史高点下跌了 80% 至 98%。在 4 月达到顶峰时，$GMT 和 $GST 分别为 4.19 美元和 9.36 美元。此后，两个代币均呈下行趋势，形势严峻。\n\n来源：GST 代币图表\n\n来源：GMT 代币图表\n一些社区成员将代币的急剧下降归因于 STEPN 应用程序在中国被禁止。\n\n“自从中国禁赛以来，这就是一场大屠杀，价格大幅下跌，以至于对于小跑步者/步行者来说，去散步几乎没有回报。” 一位 STEPN 用户和BSC 新闻的密切接触者说。“Solana 和 GST 的价格下降了，鞋子变得非常便宜（我的鞋子损失惨重）。”\n在 STEPN 流行的高峰期，用户可以通过在单人模式下在附近慢跑来赚取数百美元。即使使用基本运动鞋，也有可能以 9.36 美元的最高价格获得 3-4 美元 GST 的 NFT 每日奖励。目前，同样的步行，在 4 月份可以为用户赚取高达 40 美元的收益，但收益仅为 0.82 美元左右。\n\n以前，使用 Solana NFT 的成本约为 600 美元，获得正的投资回报率大约需要 16 天。但目前，截至 7 月 14 日，购买最便宜的 Sneaker 的成本约为 69.88 美元。以目前的价格点，投资者需要大约 145 天才能达到收支平衡，每天的回报为 0.70 美元。结果，一些社区成员之间出现了看跌情绪。\n\n“有些人还在玩游戏……我的意思是，距离禁令还有一个月的时间……如果我在中国，我会舒服地玩游戏，等到 7 月 10 日扔掉我的运动鞋离开。” STEPN Discord 的一位社区成员说。\n‍\n\n积极推动\n该公司在一篇Medium 帖子中表示，尽管过去几个月加密市场状况有所下降，但 STEPN 第二季度的利润为 1.225 亿美元。\n\n资源\nM2E 协议计划利用其利润的 5% 为其 GMT 代币启动回购和销毁计划。然而，为防止价格突然波动，回购和销毁过程“可能需要几周时间才能完成”。\n\n此外，开发人员表示，除了回购和销毁计划之外，STEPN 将分配资本储备来改进现有功能并建立团队。尽管该协议面临挑战，但许多人仍然保持乐观。\n\n“如果 STEPN 团队最终确定了他们的产品并开始了大规模的营销活动，那么事情仍然可能再次上升。散步或跑步的赚钱部分吸引了许多人，他们只是还不知道，或者还不习惯使用加密钱包，”一位接近BSC 新闻的 STEPN 成员说。“为了让 STEPN 成功，我认为他们需要针对没有加密领域经验的人开展大型营销活动，我认为他们应该为不了解私钥等的人提供托管钱包。 ”\nSTEPN 报告称，该公司已经确定了几个投资其赚取资本的领域，以便改进游戏玩法。其中包括安全增强、防止机器人获得 GMT 的反作弊机制、建立开发人员和核心团队，以及确保赞助和合作伙伴关系。\n\n“我投入了很多。我现在不担心回报，因为我专注于长期。现在，我正在增加我在两条链上的持股量，增加我的主要鞋子，并为第三领域做准备，”一位社区成员说。\n在 SOL领域和 BNB 领域取得成功之后，STEPN 打算在以太坊上引入APE 领域。\n\nSTEPN 团队将这个 Realm 描述为“一个拥抱时尚和其他 NFT 社区的伟大实验”。\nAPE Realm 将为所有 STEPN 用户提供对创新的新 Realm 的访问，专注于可访问性和引入新用户。\n\n资料来源： STEPN 路线图\n‍\n\n离别的思念\n由于行业低迷，以及中国数据法禁止存储公民 GPS 数据，STEPN 不得不屏蔽中国用户。此外，STEPN 的平台自推出以来一直受到一系列分布式拒绝服务 (DDoS) 攻击，导致用户在维护期间被警告“可能无法正确记录锻炼”。\n\n然而，如果 STEPN 克服了这些障碍，加密货币市场可能会成为一个蓬勃发展的行业。此外，如果它的经济激励措施能激励一些人离开沙发开始行动，那也是一件好事。\n\n来源\nSTEPN 社区在社交媒体上非常活跃，仅在 Twitter 上就有超过 640,000 名关注者。许多用户在 NFT 市场上创造了高流动性，使升级后的运动鞋更容易出售。最后但同样重要的是，即将到来的租赁升级和以太坊上的 Ape Realm 应该会增加用户群，增加所有代币的价值。\n\n‍\n\n什么是步骤：\nSTEPN 是一个结合了 GameFi 和 SocialFi 元素的 Web3 应用程序，允许用户 Move & Earn（移动和赚取）。用户将通过步行、慢跑或户外跑步来获得游戏内代币。STEPN 在 GST 和 GMT 两种代币机制下运行（治理代币，供应有限）。", "timestamp": 1658294829, "digest": "kSputhbcyogfyAjdWpMV7jRgBeEBVPCdU3bbxxmpOjA", "contributor": "0x15dBF63A1b262A961A8FD743cf924A6B007E844B"}

For this short moment, you will lose your eternal self.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VqkIEikkMHzI7yPUKpwy6.png?height=266&width=429)\n\nLife often plays tricks on us and makes it difficult to realize our visions. Sometimes you feel angry, but more often you feel helpless and sigh. \"Desire\" prompts people to become involuntary, to do some things that disgust and disgust themselves, and they have to humble themselves in front of their superiors and make compromises. Thinking about being a human being is such a contradiction, you have to wear a mask to survive. There is really no need to condemn yourself too much, and you must not disturb your state of mind for this. Because we are not saints, our minds have lost too much freedom, and our mood often becomes bad. Many things backfire. As long as we don't go beyond the bottom line of being a human being, don't violate the principle of being a human being, and don't harm or deceive others, let's forget those unpleasant things in life as soon as possible, right?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AsikOxziEgzJ_lCLaRlUD.png?height=266&width=430)\n\nSometimes people are just weird. The work is easy, free and less stressful, but they always stare at low wages and never think much about how comfortable they are. On the contrary, the work is tense, unfree, and the pressure is high, and you always stare at the pressure. You should look at the high labor remuneration. How many people envy and dream of it? God can't give you everything, only let you do whatever Choose the same, understand this truth, and naturally find the reason why many people are unhappy. We must measure ourselves properly and try not to engage in work that is beyond our capacity. After a long time, you will feel unbearable and need to stop and adjust in time to decompress yourself.

First of all, forget your age and learn and play like a child, then you will be full of vitality and youthful.\n\nThe world is too big, and people are as small as a speck of dust. When we are unhappy, we should think more about the happiness that life brings to us. Being alive is a gift from God to us. How many terminally ill patients are fighting against the disease on the edge of death every day in order to survive. Thinking about them, we should really feel lucky. right. Do more things that are good for your body after work, maintain your own personality and style, and don't follow others' opinions blindly. A person's enlightenment must start from the source of life. Whether in life or work, we must understand it with our heart. Some things can be bought when lost, and some things are lost forever. Life is the need for us to constantly accumulate strength, in order to be able to play freely.To live is to be calm and free, you really don't have to take too much into consideration. Only after you have tasted all the flavors of life can you realize the true meaning of life. Whether you are looking for it hard, or you encounter it on the way, please cherish everything that is beautiful around you. Times have changed, things are right and wrong, and many things are beyond our control. I have a calmness and indifference in my heart, a little bit more persistence, a little bit of strength, and I keep precipitating myself in the years, smiling and cheering to the past. As long as our hearts are full of sunshine, we will be able to reshape a new self.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PL-gdyMnFMCYPPzBKSUKS.png?height=295&width=474)\n\nThe night was long and quiet, and you could hear your own heartbeat. The night is warm and leisurely, so that the impetuous heart returns to peace. The night is still deep, and when the hustle and bustle dissipates, the excitement will eventually return to dullness. I don’t know how many times I wake up from my sleep, with thousands of emotions that I can’t bear, and lingering past events, feelings, dreams and disappointments. I don't know where the dream is tonight? Maybe it's beautiful, so beautiful that I don't want to wake up. In fact, human life is a kind of mood, no matter love or hate, success or failure, people will always rise and fall, not to be happy with things, not to be sad, we must face it calmly and pass it with a smile.", "timestamp": 1658294973, "digest": "T4Hoo7ySxyu04aZpXCdZvztW1T9Nyj7EjbehPQv1x5w", "contributor": "0xD356d298dbCf1B3a598A8dcdbBa193c5B4D85684"}

{"id": "7L-DYdhIgIvirFxmIELPxYb8JjDX1ieqV7Nv7n3vdmM", "title": "willingness", "body": "Deep in the mountains, there is a village. The farmers here have a habit of leaving 10% of the grain for the birds to eat after the autumn harvest, so the birds stay here every year and constantly eliminate pests. As a result, the next year, the farmers are happy After a bumper harvest, another 10% of the food is left behind...\n\nThis story gave me a great shock, the \"willing spirit\" of the villagers is really admirable. In fact, in our daily life, we can also have this \"willing spirit\".\n\nWilling, a beautiful life attitude. The story of Liu Bei's three visits to Caolu has been passed down through the ages. What he paid may only be three breaks, but what he got was Kong Ming's loyal assistance. His willingness also showed to the world at that time his attitude of respecting and cherishing talents, so more and more capable people with lofty ideals joined his account, thus achieving a generation of hegemony. A willingness not only reflects a person's courage and courage, but also reflects a person's attitude in life and his morality. Only such a person can win the follow of talents and win recognition and appreciation from all walks of life. So, willing, in fact, shows a person's attitude in life.\n\nWilling, a kind of open-minded life feelings. Fishing is becoming more and more popular now. In fact, fishing is a loss-making business. You give up far more than a little bait. You have to wait hard in the hot sun, but sometimes you can only catch a few fish or even Can't catch fish at all. Why is this kind of give-and-take movement so popular? Some say it's a hobby because fishing brings them fun. Yes, people don't do everything to gain, and sometimes giving up is a joy in itself. Those anglers under the scorching sun have no idea how many fish they can catch, they are just looking for fun in their favorite sport. The fishermen's disregard for gains and losses is also a manifestation of their open-minded life feelings. Such people are generous and generous, and they don't care too much. They are willing to give up, but they don't care. When we were still busy with our livelihood, they had already learned about life from fishing and had their own open-minded feelings. So, willingness, in fact, reflects a person's feelings in life.\n\nWilling to, a supreme realm of life. In our life, there are always some people who are always complaining, complaining that life is rough, that life is hard, and that work is tired. Complaining can't solve any problem, and fate is fair. Tao Yuanming said in \"You Orchid\", \"If you lose your way, you may be able to get through.\" When we suspect that this road is unreachable, why don't we abandon it and find another way? Don't be reluctant to give up, some things can only be moved forward easily if you let them go. The more you let go, the calmer your heart will be; the more you let go, the calmer your path will be. When you can give up everything and let go of everything, you already have a supreme realm of life. So, willing, in fact, can make people achieve a supreme realm of life!\n\nWu Song gave up his arms, but captured Fang La; Gecko gave up his tail, but escaped. It is painful to give up, but how can it be rewarded to give up? The word \"willing\" was coined by the ancients to show future generations that one should give up first and gain later. Maybe, we will never have such attitude, feelings or realm, but we have the right to pursue. I believe that when you learn to be willing, you can take your own life path calmly!\n\nOne last question: Are you really willing?", "timestamp": 1658295376, "digest": "r9d64vuP45iwML3RXW2U5Moes2JGm5acqRUTmK1tTms", "contributor": "0xD356d298dbCf1B3a598A8dcdbBa193c5B4D85684"}

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lMWwt-aqcIeDv_y4xh10J.png?height=398&width=692&&&size=medium)\n\n全文约11000字，为便于阅读，先贴出目录：\n\n1、 泡沫：脱锚？或是无锚之物\n\n2、 探索：在泡沫中沉淀价值\n\n3     破圈：从数字货币到数字内容\n\n4、 标准：从数字货币到场景、业务表达\n\n5、 价值：NFT给寒冬带来温暖\n\n6、 NFT+：置身行业中塑形和体现价值\n\n7、 展望：NFT推动加密世界通向更深远的未来\n\n## 1、泡沫：脱锚？或是无锚之物\n\n在上篇《泡沫破裂加密世界探底，未来发展需要寻求价值支撑》中，我们谈到了区块链项目Axie Infinity、Luna以及StepN,项目相关代币价格的剧烈波动引起了业界广泛关注，有时人们将这种现象称之为“脱锚”--意思是项目价值是锚，代币价格应当围绕项目价值在合理范围内波动，当价格远离该范围时，就是脱锚。问题是拿什么来考量项目的价值呢？\n\nAxie Infinity是一款“Play to Earn”的链游，那么“Play”是核心价值，还是“Earn”呢？从该游戏的设计来看，游戏的可玩性不强，但依托游戏这个“壳”的投机赚钱属性却十分明显。典型代表就是“打金”工作室的成立，其目的一方面是方便“筹金”，另一方面是雇佣更多的职业玩家更高效的“打金”。传统游戏是玩家花钱玩游戏，获得乐趣，所以玩家花钱消费成为该游戏的价值支撑；而Axie Infinity是玩家花钱玩游戏，为了赚钱，那么游戏的价值支撑变为“玩家能赚钱”。Axie Infinity本质已不是游戏，而是“赚钱工具”。传统游戏与打金游戏的价值支撑如图1-1所示。\n\n![图1-1 传统游戏与打金游戏的不同价值支撑](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VP0_H-jMjXqDTeDpiuZj0.png?height=199&width=640)\n\n对于传统游戏，玩家投入的是金钱，获得的是乐趣，游戏提供的价值成功转换并满足了用户需求，只要用户需求存在并被不断满足，那么游戏价值就得以持续和提升。而对于打金游戏，玩家花钱买道具，投入的是钱，想要获得的也是钱，用户的需求没有被转移，那么多余的钱从哪里来呢？唯一的途径就是来自“接盘侠”！可想而知，打金游戏代币价格是被“进场资金”推高的，而一旦接盘资金进场速度和规模减缓或者绝对较少，游戏代币价格就会失去支撑而加速下跌。**游戏设计者可以设计各种经济模型，但只要用户需求没有被转移，那么所有的手段最多就是延缓死亡螺旋而已**。想一想，该类打金游戏会有“价值之锚”吗？当然，不排除项目方在后续围绕“价值”部分有更多的创新，我们持续保持关注。\n\nLuna是“双币模型”的算法稳定币项目，发行了原生代币LUNA和算法稳定币UST。从根本上而言，LUNA是UST的抵押品，LUNA的价值将决定UST是否能够保持稳定。那么，LUNA的价值从何而来？为何引发了众所周知的“512惨案”，几天内市值归零？关于LUNA的成败，网络中有诸多论述，王玮老师的“**供给侧和需求侧锚定**”观点非常具有说服力。他认为LUNA是一个去中心化非足额抵押算法稳定币项目，其价值支撑分为供给侧锚定和需求侧锚定。供给侧锚定的是高波动加密货币（比如储备BTC和其他加密货币），由于剧烈波动，所以风险极大；而恰逢熊市；几乎所有加密货币价格都在加速下跌，很难发挥价值背书的作用。而需求侧锚定在当前生态用例没有建立之际，项目方提供的被动需求就是投资者购买LUNA期待高价卖出，以及质押UST获取高达20%APY的需求；前者完全取决于对于LUNA的预期和信心；后者则必须保证UST真的稳定以防止在下跌中资产被清算。但LUNA和UST加速下跌，导致预期没了，资产被清算，信心丧失，结果就是归零。**所以对于LUNA项目，无论从“供应侧锚定”还是“需求侧锚定”来看，其实都没有稳定的价值锚定。既然无锚可定，“脱锚”自然是最后必然的结局**。\n\n类似的案例很多，上述只是两个典型的案例。其实放大到整个加密世界来看，“脱锚”、“无锚可定”几乎是一个普遍存在，加密货币总市值动则下跌超过50%，甚至高达90%就是例证。这就是我在上篇中说的“全都是泡沫，只一刹的花火”。由此也引起整个行业的反思和持续探索，并努力去“发现沙滩上的贝壳”。可喜的是，我们已经看到这样的发展态势--价值可能迟到，但必将到来。\n\n# 2、探索：在泡沫中沉淀价值\n\n在这里，我们希望通过梳理区块链的一些关键节点，试图从混沌中发现规律，去寻找到泡沫中沉淀的价值。\n\n由于对中心化货币体系的失望，中本聪创建了无需信任的、去中心化货币体系比特币--一种点对点的电子现金系统；其底层是区块链分布式账本技术，基于此技术架构，软件协议和加密货币成为一体，货币实现了协议化。BTC成为区块链上最成功的加密数字货币应用。由此，以BTC和区块链的创新为始，以代码开源开路，加密世界开启了轰轰烈烈的变革创新，也带来了混乱无序。\n\n基于BTC的实现原理，Vitalik Buterin（V神）进行了功能和应用扩展，创造了以太坊（Ethereum）--下一代智能合约和去中心化应用平台，并将其定位为“世界计算机”。然而事态最初发展就偏离了V神的初衷，通用智能合约强大的“一键发币”功能，使得“**强货币关联**”的应用“ICO”首先得以爆发，人们对金钱的贪婪和欲望得到空前释放，让整个行业笼罩在“空气币”、“庞氏骗局”的氛围之中，几乎带偏了整个加密世界。\n\n2017年12月加密货币市值在“群魔乱舞”中冲高到7300亿，之后便开启了2年周期接近90%的熊市回调，这期间空气币项目变为一地鸡毛，逐渐被市场肃清。但是种子总会发芽，寒冬成为了孕育新生命的最佳时机，诸如DeFi、Filecoin、Polkadot、Cosmos等明星项目在此期间萌芽诞生。\n\n在这里重点提及一下Polkadot，因为我们认为波卡网络很可能成为未来价值互联网的基石。从公链来说，Polkadot在技术创新和生态建设风格上都显示出独特之处。其创始人Gavin Wood是ETH的联合创始人、CTO、黄皮书的撰写者，是Web3.0概念提出者，业界一直认为“没人比他更了解以太坊的优势，也没人比他更清楚以太坊的缺点”。所以Gavin Wood推出的Polkadot（波卡链）--畅想一种异构的多链架构，跳出了BTC和以太坊的技术基础架构的束缚，将Polkadot定位为Layer0,希望为各个区块链提供一个“最小化、高安全、可扩展”的基础设施。比较BTC、ETH，Polkadot最突出创新就是“链级别”的扩展，从而使得跨链互联、价值（信息、数据、资产等）无边界传递变得安全、简单、高效。显然波卡在技术架构和愿景上有更宏大的叙事，在生态建设上创首创先行网和主网运行机制，显得严谨务实、具有次第性和风险意识，似乎一切都是为真实应用而来。在行事风格上，波卡更像个“技术派”，默默耕耘，少了许多浮华与炒作，这恰是当下加密世界企需的品质。波卡获得了业界的广泛认可和支持，正当本文组稿之际，Messari发布了2022年上半年基金持仓分析报告，在对所有投资组合进行全面分析后指出，拥有最多基金持仓的资产依然是Polkadot（DOT），82支基金中有29支持有，这意味着追踪的基金中35%都看好波卡的成功。我们期待波卡生态厚积薄发，穿越寒冬，迎来价值网络Web3的春暖花开。\n\n在熊市沉寂的2年中，ETH生态应用得以蓄势发展，趋于成熟和具有规模，并在2000年后以Compoud、AAVE、Curve、Uniswap等为代表的创新应用中迎来“DeFi Summer”。在各种抵押、借贷、保险、Dex、Stablecoin、资产跨链等各种协议创新和金融应用中，加密货币总市值突破2018年前高，并在2021年5月达到2.5万亿美元。在这次牛市中，加密世界创新**从“强货币关联”走向了“强金融关联”**，连V神也承认DeFi是目前为止以太坊上最成功的应用，但这超乎预料，他甚至多次表达希望以太坊、或者区块链不要过度金融化，而是回到泛计算机应用类的平台。\n\n很显然，**金融天然具备“杠杆”能力，“杠杆叠加贪婪”拉扯着人们远离“价值”，就会滋生巨大泡沫**。在经过短暂2个月50%回调后，在随后“多链爆发、链游打金、NFT争霸、元宇宙卖地、传统机构入场”的喧嚣热闹中，加密世界开启了更加疯狂的“泡沫冲顶”，并在21年11月达到最高3万亿市值，从此开始了漫长的回调之旅，迄今已回落超过70%。\n\n与前几轮泡沫不同，在这次泡沫起伏中，我们发现加密世界比以往更加表现出“创新精神”，除去技术上如公链、标准、隐私计算、中间件等创新，在应用创新上更是呈现爆发之势，如各种“X to earn”、社交网络图谱、DID、元宇宙、数字艺术、创作者经济等。而且，**我们发现这些应用有一个共同点--都跟NFT关系密切。这应该不是巧合，那么现象背后蕴含着什么呢？**\n\nNFT，一种非同质化通证，在首先被作为数字艺术、收藏品被热烈追捧的背后，似乎还蕴藏着更强大的能力。**对于这样一个新生事物，整个行业还需要加以时间深入理解，但人们已经发现，以NFT为抓手，可以跳出“数字货币”，扩展出新的应用方向，成为一个转折点，甚至推动加密世界通向更深远的未来。**\n\n# 3、破圈：从数字货币到数字内容\n\n**关注**。关于NFT的概念和前身可以追溯到1993年的加密交易卡，但人们大量关注NFT源于2017年一款名为CryptoKitties（加密猫）的区块链游戏。游戏中，用户可以购买、繁殖、出售和收集虚拟猫咪。这些猫咪本质上是NFT，由ERC-721支持实现，独一无二，不可复制，每一个都具有独特属性，如眼睛形状、眼睛颜色、毛发图案、表情等。加密猫游戏很受欢迎，一度拥有150万用户，高峰期产生了4000万美元的交易。最贵的小猫“龙”曾以600ETH（当时价值17万美元，现在价值66万美元）的价格售出。而这时的玩家多是加密世界的人士，NFT并未进入大众视野。\n\n**破圈**。经过3年的沉寂，在2020年，数字艺术家Beeple耗时14年创作的作品《Everydays: The First 5000 Days》，最终以6934万美元的价格在英国著名拍卖平台佳士得上卖出。这幅作品由5000张图片拼接而成，其中每一个图片是Beeple从2007年开始每天完成一张，最终成为一个316 MB的JPG文件。**一张Web2中稀松平常的JPEG图片在Web3中居然价值不菲，让人脑洞大开，并由此引爆了NFT创作热潮，一时间区块链携NFT走向主流大众，开始在艺术、收藏、娱乐、游戏等领域发酵。**\n\n**爆发**。2021年NFT行情爆发，呈现出百花齐放，百家争鸣，一派繁荣的景象。NFT就是一个框，什么都可以装：\n\n* *在文字类NFT方面*，Vine创始人推出了简单到令人咂舌的NFT项目--Loot，每个NFT仅有8行字符，分别代表游戏人物常见的8个装备，武器、胸甲、头盔、腰甲、足甲、手甲、项链、戒指，而这样的表达在Web2中就是一个文本而已，而披上NFT的马甲后地板价在当时已超过2万美金，总交易量超过4400万美元。\n* *在头像类图片NFT方面*，Crytopunks、Bored Ape Yacht Club冲上排行榜首，单价高达2千万美元，成为整个生态中最昂贵的项目。而当这类PFP项目进一步成为更紧密且内部高度认同的社群时，商业价值凸显，头像已成为数字时代身份象征、社交圈门票和社交资本。\n* *在艺术收藏品方面*，不仅国外艺术收藏圈活跃，国内主流互联网企业基于联盟链技术，也在积极探索“数字藏品”发展路径。其中阿里的鲸探，腾讯的幻核以及视觉中国的“元视觉”等，都是数字内容创作和知识产权保护的积极尝试。\n* *在音乐NFT方面*，美国流行音乐巨匠3LAU发布了33张NFT版的专辑《Ultraviolet》，总共创造了1168万美元的成交额。这是第一张音乐NFT专辑，开创了音乐专辑发行、版权销售的新方式，使得音乐人可以通过NFT获得收入，连接粉丝，共建社群和共享价值，或将改变音乐行业运营发展的轨迹。国内众多音乐人开始入场，其中包括周杰伦、胡彦斌、阿朵等。\n* *在视频NFT方面*，NBA Top Shot拔得头筹，以视频NFT方式记录了体育明星在赛场上的高光时刻，使其在区块链上成为永恒的“时光记忆”。该项目上线8个月内，有超百万人加入，NFT销售金额超过7亿美金。不仅为NBA的商业运作开辟了新的版图，也为视频NFT的发展打了一个不错的样板。\n* *在NFT游戏方面*，NFT为游戏产业的发展带来了“Play to Earn”链游新模式，大量玩家被吸引进来。代表项目：Axie Infinity、 StepN、Alien Worlds、CryptoBlades等。但这个阶段的链游，可玩性不强，打金味十足，NFT被包裹了游戏的外壳，本质上是拿来赚钱的数字资产工具。\n\n**转折**。NFT基于区块链分布式账本技术实现，**本质上是一种载体**，可以承载各种形式的内容，如上述的文字、图片、音乐、视频、游戏等。这些内容以NFT的形式呈现，被分布式永久存储，能防篡改、可追溯、可计价、可确权，转变成了一种数字内容资产，并可在全球范围内交易和广泛流通，**这其实就是数字内容资产化的一种方式**。在这个阶段，区块链的“Token（通证）”内涵得以实际扩展，从加密数字货币“强货币关联”、“强金融关联”转变到“数字内容+资产属性”而形成“**强数字内容资产关联**”。这过程中，NFT作为数字媒介功不可没，在事实上增加了“数字内容资产”这样一种新的资产类别，并带来了一系列创新。\n\n此时的NFT被作为收藏品、艺术品、PFP等数字内容资产，主要用来满足用户收藏、投资交易、炫酷方面的需求。但我们认为，**一方面**与数字货币资产一样，数字内容资产作为基础要素、金融手段等将在未来数字经济建设中发挥重要作用；**同时**我们发现新的发展态势开始出现，随着支持NFT的标准不断创新和发展，NFT的使用价值正在被开发出来，可以在各种商业、社会等场景中得以使用。\n\n这是更为重要的转变，促使我们更深入思考：NFT将走向何方，市场如何重新定位和评估NFT价值？这需要进一步展开讨论并尝试寻找可能的答案。\n\n# 4、标准：从数字货币到场景、业务表达\n\n区块链应用从加密数字货币、DeFi到数字内容的发展，以及后续的商业应用，离不开标准的支持，其中使用最为广泛的是以太坊上的ERC-20及ERC-721。\n\nERC-20是一种同质化通证（FT）标准，适用于加密数字货币，其等价可互换，可分割，便于交易和流通，这使得加密数字货币发行及DeFi金融类创新得以爆发。ERC721是一种非同质化通证（NFT）,具有不可复制、不可互换、不可分割的特性，在保证NFT所有权的真实性、唯一性、安全性、透明性、转移便捷性、可追溯性等方面具有优势，主要适用于具有独特性、稀有度的艺术品、收藏品的发行、交易和流通。\n\n而继ERC-20、ERC721之后，涌现出一批NFT标准，如ERC-1155（游戏类NFT）、ERC-1523（保险单NFT）、ERC-898（可嵌套的NFT）、EIP-1948（可变信息的NFT） 、EIP-2981 （NFT版税）等。如图4-1所示列出了部分NFT标准。\n\n![图4-1 NFT相关标准特征、定位及用例](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jj01rxaFh8Vskc0toKCvd.png?height=819&width=516&&&size=medium)\n\n我们看到，这类标准已经逐步脱离数字货币表达，作用于数字内容，使得数字内容资产化变得简单而高效，比如ERC-721用于稀缺性极强的数字藏品、虚拟房产、ＰＦＰ、艺术作品，ERC-1155用于游戏行业中道具的批量生成和处理，继而掀起了各类数字内容NFT创作和投资交易的热潮。\n\n同时，我们也发现一些标准强化了与业务、应用的逻辑关联，比如保险单NFT标准ERC-1523、NFT版税EIP-2981以及可计算票证vNFT等。**其中RMRK值得特别关注**。RMRK是基于波卡和KUSAMA生态系统的NFT标准，被称之为“目前最先进的NFT标准”。RMRK并没有复杂的智能合约作为支持，而是一组用于解释特殊数据的规则和标准，可以作为解释区块链上“涂鸦”的工具。与ERC721和ERC1155不同，RMRK更像是NFT领域中的乐高，具备多资源加载、复合及嵌套、优先级选择、冗余存储、条件渲染等特性，可以面向不同应用、业务逻辑提供系统性支持。\n\n**综上，我们认为NFT作为非匀质通证，其优势在于具有超强的自描述能力，每一个NFT都可以加载不同应用及业务内容，具有不同性质**。因此，NFT在标准的支持下，将被广泛地运用到实际应用中，从而获得持续的价值支撑，其价值将得以重新评估。\n\n# 5、价值：NFT给寒冬带来温暖\n\n在第三章节中，我们通过“关注-破圈-爆发-转折”总结性地对NFT发展作了梳理，伴随这个过程，NFT市场规模得以快速扩张，这个可以从NFT整体市值变化得到验证。\n\n根据NFTGO的统计数据,从2017年NFT因加密猫开始受到圈内人士**关注**，当时整个NFT市值不过10万美元左右；经过3年蓄势，在2020年**破圈**进入主流艺术行业，仍市值仍未突破1亿美元；而到2022年，NFT在艺术、收藏、体育、娱乐、游戏等各个行业**爆发**，市值从年初的2.5亿美元开始加速增长，到2022年1月超过350亿，全年增长超过100倍。虽然在当下全球资本熊市环境下，大多数加密货币价格已经回落超过80%，NFT市值也有相应回调，但仍然保持在220亿美元规模，如图5-1所示。\n\n![图5-1 NFT市值变化（数据来源：NFTGO）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zY4j5Ujlee8ZM0qQ_zrFm.png?height=179&width=670)\n\n另外，我们从NFT持有者数量也发现，越来越多的用户加入了“Holders”，从2017年寥寥几百人，到2022年6月累计达到250万人，5年间增长接近1万倍，成为整体市值的贡献者和行业发展的推动者。如图5-2所示。\n\n![图5-2 NFT持有者规模变化(绿线）（数据来源：NFTGO）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5vf_UbrD0BCd6AeBD28iI.png?height=205&width=769)\n\n不得不说，NFT正在为当下加密世界寒冬带来温暖，NFT总市值及持有者规模变化给出了有力的证明。按照NFT如此的发展态势，我们有理由相信NFT或将成为熊市中结构性牛市或者下一次牛市的推手。我们希望从后续的分析中发现更多线索。\n\n而从NFT分类市值分布来看，这份“寒冬温暖”主要来自于PFP（约134亿，占61%）、收藏品（约32亿，占15%），二者总和超过76%；而Game、艺术、土地、公用设施大概都在16-19亿美元之间，而代表新兴方向如元宇宙、数字IP、社交网络等呈现发展之势，但市值占据极少份额。如图5-3所示。\n\n![图5-3 分类NFT市值占比（数据来源：NFTGO）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X7gf11WcIR2QAT_OoYoa1.png?height=183&width=704)\n\n分类市值占比的状况，正好印证了本文前面关于加密领域从“数字货币资产”到“数字内容资产”的变化--基于区块链分布式账本底层技术特性，这些PFP、收藏品、游戏、艺术品等数字内容以NFT为载体被转变为“数字内容资产”，并首先在艺术、体育、音视频娱乐等行业破圈，引发财富效应，受到热烈追捧。\n\n同时，我们也分析到，随着NFT标准对场景、业务支持能力的变化，NFT正在发生更为重要的演进，将来NFT不仅作为一种“数字资产”成为加密世界不可或缺的底层逻辑，发挥金融属性方面的能力；**另一方面，NFT或将在跟DApp的结合中，发挥更加基础性、工具性、要素性、功能性的价值。如果这些情景逐一发生，那么NFT将作为“一种桥梁”，推动区块链与传统行业的结合，推动现实世界与虚拟世界的融合，加密世界将在该过程中获得真正的价值支撑，爆发更强大的生命力和“蝴蝶效应”**。我们预计下一次牛市，不再仅是投机和泡沫，还有无数精美珍贵的“珍珠贝壳”。\n\n# 6、NFT+：置身行业中塑形和体现价值\n\n### 6.1 围绕NFT已形成的产业价值链\n\n可以将NFT产业价值链按功能属性划分为基础设施层、项目创作层、衍生应用层。如图6-1所示。\n\n![图6-1 围绕NFT形成的产业价值链（图片来源：A&T Capital）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CdLmX086sPcNaejlr7PJ-.png?height=337&width=693)\n\n上游基础设施层为NFT铸造和交易提供基础设施支持，如共识、计算、存储以及一些辅助功能，该层包含底层公链、侧链/L2、联盟链以及代币标准、开发工具、储存、钱包等。其价值捕获主要来自NFT铸造产生的Gas Fee。\n\n项目创作层主要是NFT的铸造和一级市场发行，目前集中在艺术/收藏类、游戏类、元宇宙土地类、粉丝经济类等。其价值捕获主要来自一级市场交易。\n\n下游衍生应用层则围绕一级市场铸造的NFT衍生出NFT二级市场、数据平台、策展/社区、社交平台以及金融应用等。这一层价值捕获主要基于流量和需求变现。\n\n每层中分布着各种跟NFT关联的项目，图中已有清晰呈现，不再赘述。他们如乐高一样组合在一起，协同发挥作用和贡献价值。\n\n###

面向行业应用释放使用价值\n\n基于图6-1给出了当下NFT产业价值链较为整体的视图，我们发现这些应用主要基于“NFT作为数字内容资产”而衍生出来的投资交易、抵押等金融类应用，如PFP买卖和抵押。从现状来看，**这类行为主要还是满足用户对数字内容资产所有权和产权的需求，核心是赚钱的需求。这是NFT资产属性带来的价值**。该类价值评估往往偏于主观，比如一个BAYC头像，有人觉得价值千万，但也有人觉得一文不值。这种“不确定性”在贪婪和热钱推动下，就会滋生金融泡沫，创造出脆弱的“纸上财富”，不具有持续性，反而给个人和社会带来巨大的风险。这正是加密世界正在发生的事实。\n\n**所以NFT后续的发展，需要找到可持续的价值支撑**。为了实现这样的目标，**首先在思路上**，还是要把握住“金融服务实体”这一总体基调，让金融属性回归底层逻辑，润物无声，发挥基础支撑和宏观调控作用；**其次在当前的在实践中**，NFT作为数字内容资产已被不断强化，无需过度炒作；**最重要的是面向未来发展，需要跳出金融资产的“框框”，创新出面向行业的非资产类应用--也就是将NFT特性与行业结合，使其进入生产性过程，释放NFT的使用价值，或许这是更长远的路。**\n\n### 6.3 NFT基础设施和应用创新\n\n在这里，**我们提供一个观察角度，将NFT作为一种基本要素和主导变量**，**为其注入不同内容和业务逻辑，尝试去发现NFT获得新的生命力，以及可能推动行业发展的潜力和未来方向**。\n\n* **社交身份**：Web3倡导自由、公平的价值观，用户身份不应再依赖中心化平台，而诸如5Degrees、Cyberconnect、Lens Protocol这样的Web3.0社交网络协议提供了Profile NFT，以此建立统一的去中心化身份系统，其中包含了钱包地址、头像、昵称、Twitter账户以及个人资料等。用户与DApp进行交互、创作等产生的行为、内容数据都为用户所有，用户获得自主权，可以自由铸造关注NFT和被关注NFT,以此建立起用户拥有的社交网络图谱。对于DApp开发者来说，只需专注业务，并通过与社交图谱协议结合而获得用户及用户数据，打破中心化平台的数据垄断。\n* **行为凭证**：诸如POAP、Project Galaxy等协议，以NFT的形式来实现对人们行为的证明，比如出席某个重要会议、获得某种成就、对某个提案进行投票等。这些凭证背后的链上数据，防篡改、可追溯，可信任，将是用户“知识、技能、能力、阅历、资产、信用”最好的证明，可以运用到日常的个人征信、求职、金融贷款、VIP会员等方面，甚至能够改变现实中的社会地位。\n* **游戏身份与角色**：PhalaWorld将Phala Network链上的用户行为、角色、社区和Sci-Fi故事进行映射、融合，实现了区块链系统与元宇宙游戏相互赋能，并借助与RMRK和Bit.Country的合作关系，共同开发探索NFT和元宇宙游戏基础设施。PhalaWorld是第一个在NFT中引入“Soulbound” 理念的元宇宙游戏产品，NFT被赋予了丰富的内涵，比如Spirit NFT利用Litentry的MCP聚合用户链上链下行为数据而形成的一种不可转让的“Soulbound”NFT；用户可以为自己的Spirit搭配不同的Shell NFT，Shell NFT包括了玩家的不同种族和职业，类似游戏中的角色。\n* **游戏装备**：NFT可以嵌入大量的业务逻辑，游戏装备升级的业务逻辑可以直接写在NFT的内容层。比如在链游StepN中的虚拟跑鞋就是以NFT形式实现的游戏装备，玩家可通过运动、维修、繁殖、合成等对该装备进行升级。\n* **创作内容**：Mirror.xyz是Web3理念的集大成者，其基于NFT，结合创作流程，为内容创作者打造了一套所有权经济的组合拳，其中包括内容写作、内容分享、内容NFT化、内容产品众筹、内容拍卖以及创作者个人通证发放的功能。2021年4月作家Emily Segal使用Mirror为她即将出版的小说“Burn Alpha”发起众筹，最终从投资者处筹集了24个以太币（约40.8万人民币），而投资者也将拥有第一版NFT的部分所有权，并将持续获得版权费。这在创作者经济生态中具有划时代的意义。\n* **可计算票证**：Solv团队创建的vNFT致力于为非匀质化通证NFT添加可计算性，即在保留NFT强大的个性化描述能力的同时，使“数量”成为其 NFT 的核心属性，使之能够支持数学运算。可计算NFT是兼容ERC721的“超级NFT”，同时具备ERC20与ERC721的特长，是通用的非货币类数字资产描述协议，可以广泛应用于数字艺术品、数字出版物、数字票证、标准化虚拟商品的描述和表示，也可以成为线下实体商品映射上链的理想协议。这是首个由中国背景的团队提出的加密数字资产国际标准。\n* **数据要素**：社会经济活动中产生大量的数据，这些元数据都是散落非结构化的，难以互通，利用效率极低；也因为难以确权和隐私保护，所以数据价值发挥不出来。但NFT可以承载各种数据，成为数据类NFT，并根据应用目的使其结构化；同时利用NFT为数据确权，利用隐私计算实现数据脱敏，便于数据的流通和转移，使之成为数据要素进入要素市场，参与到经济活动中去，释放出数据的价值。\n* **虚拟生产资料**：Axie Infinity虽然在币价和用户规模上遭遇了大幅波动，这跟其游戏设计、经济模型以及大环境变动都有关系。但其基于NFT建立的“Play to Earn”游戏模式具有重大的创新意义，对行业的贡献不可小觑--用户付出的时间和劳动借助NFT得以记录并沉淀为资产，NFT在其中既是生产资料、生产力工具，同时也是劳动成果，并在流动和交易中可变现价值，甚至于改变、形成新的生产和协作关系（玩家、公会、游戏开放商）。\n\n# 7、展望：NFT推动加密世界通向更深远的未来\n\n### ７.１ NFT是资产价值和使用价值融合的载体\n\nWeb3被称之为价值网络，其价值有诸多的呈现形式，比如原生的加密数字货币、数据确权与资产化、价值交易与流转等。在目前阶段主要表现为数字货币、数字内容资产化，这首先满足了人们对金钱、资产的追求。而货币、数字资产带有金融属性，具有杠杆作用，在众人接力之下吹起了一个又一个泡沫。但金融杠杆吹起的泡沫本身很脆弱，也不可能无限膨胀，需要由实际的使用价值进行填充。如果二者错配，破灭是迟早的事。NFT的出现和发展，为此提供了可行的解决方案。\n\n区块链系统使得货币协议化，协议资产化，协议和资产成为了一体，价值可以在技术架构各个层级中自由传递，为资产化和使用价值的结合创造了条件，NFT便是这样一个完美的载体。如图7-1所示。\n\n![图7-1　ＮＦＴ是资产价值和使用价值融合的载体](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qUWMrzVRvE_VwIaDW34Ac.png?height=245&width=511)\n\n### ７.２　利用NFT实现资产化和可用性再平衡\n\n当下，Web2与Web3在可用性和资产化方面各有优劣，都呈现出失衡的状态。\n\n在Web2 App中，信息可以得以完美表达和传递，在功能、效率、体验方面完胜Web3 DApp,但在数据价值表达、数据确权及资产化等方面缺乏有效手段，使得虽然用户贡献了主要价值，但用户个人价值得不到主张，且利益主要被中心化平台占有，呈现一种割裂的状态。\n\n而Web3借助底层区块链系统推动了价值的完美表达和去中心化分配，但在可用性方面差强人意。究其原因，这跟区块链的“去中心化-安全-可扩展性”不可能三角特性有关，也跟当下区块链技术体系仍在发展中，一些基础设施、组件等还不够完善有关。\n\n但随着加密世界不断发展，一些问题已经得以解决，比如通过“共识与计算分离，实现链上共识，链下计算”解决不可能三角问题；而有些问题人们找到一个抓手，由此实现一系列突破，推动区块链往“可用性”更近一步。\n\n**NFT就是这样一个抓手，一方面作为一种“数字资产”，能够承载和释放Web3的价值属性；同时，作为一种基础设施、工具、生产资料、组件，或者场景等，可以将“可用性”价值发挥出来。从而在Web3应用中实现资产化和可用性的平衡。**\n\n### ７.3　以NFT来构建Web3价值互联网\n\n在“2021世界区块链大会·杭州”上，Solv联合创始人孟岩认为，**下一代数字经济的基础是价值互联网。在未来的价值互联网上，大部分的通证都是非匀质的，匀质通证只是一小部分。NFT是比FT更优秀的数字价值载体，未来的价值互联网主要是建立在非匀质通证NFT上，这是价值互联网必然趋势。**\n\n基于NFT的价值互联网仍需要大量基础设施建设和应用创新，而行业各种变化正在为此努力。一是各种NFT标准提供了应用、业务逻辑的支持，如ERC-1155、ERC-4907、RMRK、vNFT等；二是NFT相关的应用协议不断涌现，如5Degrees、Cyberconnect、PhalaWorld、Mirror、Solv Vouchers等；三是越来越多传统品牌进入NFT不再只是投资，而是利用NFT进行品牌建设、市场营销、用户触达和社区建设等，如耐克、奥利奥、路易·威登等。诸多有利因素，因缘和合之下，利用NFT构建价值互联网已成为当下的发展趋势。\n\n虽然时值加密世界乃至全球经济寒冬，我们感受到了泡沫破裂带来的危机，但NFT仍然让我们感受到“希望的生机”。**作为资产和使用价值融合的数字载体，NFT成为泡沫中沉淀的价值，可以作为一种纽带，连接传统世界和加密世界、现实世界和虚拟世界，搭建起“平行世界之桥”。**\n\n我们期待这座“平行世界之桥”，能够推动加密世界通向更深远的未来。",

Она позволяет торговать бессрочными фьючерсами на Waves Protocol с кредитным плечом до 10. Благодаря уникальным свойствам лежащей в основе технологии, он позволяет не только торговать криптовалютами, но и дает возможность работать на рынках NFT (например, BAYC floor-price) и сырьевых товаров (нефть, газ). Наличие такого инструмента оказывается чрезвычайно полезным для хеджирования, арбитража и спекуляций.\n\n> Объем торгов на различных обменных площадках экосистемы Waves превышает $20M в день. Однако всей экосистеме не хватает важного инструмента - торговли фьючерсами, который может позволить пользователям торговать с кредитным плечом и/или занимать короткие позиции. Без такой возможности экосистема DeFi не может быть полноценной.\n\nЗдесь в Tsunami мы верим в децентрализацию. Мы разрабатываем Tsunami для работы в полностью децентрализованном, верифицируемом, надежном, бесконтактном режиме. Мы используем новейшие технологии DeFi, такие как vAMM, которые позволяют бесконтактно торговать любыми активами. Более того, мы также привносим нечто совершенно новое - позволяя нашим пользователям делать длинные (или короткие!) позиции на рынке NFT, занимая позицию, подверженную цене \"флора\" ведущих коллекций NFT - Punks, BAYC, даже если они не торгуются на Waves.\n\nТорговля активами за пределами традиционных криптовалют позволяет трейдерам и инвесторам радикально диверсифицировать свой портфель, что чрезвычайно важно, особенно в периоды медвежьего рынка. Участие в торговле сырьевыми товарами позволяет эффективно хеджировать падение криптовалютного рынка.\n\nTsunami будет управляться токеном TSN. TSN будет основным токеном, позволяющим пользователям участвовать в распределении комиссий протокола, используя стейкинг. Держатели TSN будут иметь возможность голосовать за основные решения протокола - включая изменение комиссий и запуск новых рынков.\n\nЦель Tsunami - создать наилучший возможный UX в пространстве DeFi. Поэтому мы не только делаем наш пользовательский интерфейс чистым и простым в использовании, но и внедряем механику геймификации. Мы рассматриваем геймификацию как форму дополнительной доходности для трейдеров, позволяя им зарабатывать дополнительные награды, участвуя в ежедневных, еженедельных и ежемесячных торговых соревнованиях, исследуя новые рынки и выполняя квест по вхождению в систему. Поступая таким образом, они получают право на полезные награды NFT, которые могут быть активированы для временного снижения комиссий, предоставления доступа к редким NFT ведущих художников и многого другого.\n\n**Дорожная карта запуска Tsunami:**\n\n* **Whitepaper**\n\nМы создадим подробный документ, в котором будут описаны все внутренние детали и механизмы работы биржи. Также, более подробно о vAMM и бессрочных контрактах!\n\n* **Стимулируемый testnet**\n\nПоскольку Tsunami - это передовая технология, основанная на последних достижениях DeFi, сделать ее как можно более стабильной - первоочередная задача команды. Перед запуском mainnet мы запустим testnet, где каждый сможет попробовать торговать на Tsunami, не рискуя реальными криптовалютами. Первые трейдеры будут вознаграждены за их вклад в тестирование, поиск и сообщение об ошибках и т.д.\n\n* **Первоначальное предложение ликвидности**\n\nЛиквидность токена TSN и страховой фонд биржи Tsunami будут обеспечены за счет ILO.\n\n* **Запуск сети Mainnet**\n\nMainnet будет поддерживать торговлю криптовалютными парами (BTC, Waves и т.д.). Кроме того, токен TSN можно будет сдавать в стейкинг на бирже для получения высокой доходности.\n\n* **Рынки NFT**\n\nBAYC, Punks будут доступны для трейдеров (цена флор)\n\n* **Товарные рынки**\n\nНефть и газ (и, возможно, другие товары, такие как пшеница или золото) будут доступны для торговли на Tsunami.\n\n* **Предоставление ликвидности с использованием кредитного плеча**\n\nПользователи смогут предоставлять ликвидность на биржу с использованием кредитного плеча, усиливая свою доходность.\n\n* **Торговля опционами**\n\nТорговля опционами придет в протокол Waves.\n\n**Tsunami создает энергичное сообщество трейдеров.

的应用，改善这个问题是当务之急。\n\n很多人在使用加密货币资产过程容易中犯一些低级类的错误，比如手滑将高价值的资产错误地发送到无法访问的钱包地址或者不小心点到钓鱼链接。 这种错误会导致人们对这些高价值资产类的保险产生了需求。但在历史数据极少、资产估值不稳定以及存在安全问题的市场上，精算师们该如何为这些资产的保费定价？让我们来看看几个考虑因素。\n\n## 需要考虑的因素：\n\n未来的投保人将需要具体说明他们想要保险针对什么，由于缺乏专一性可能会导致保险公司为一般保单的保费增加额外的缓冲因素，但有些保障可能并不相关。\n\n* 投保人是为 Token（ERC-721或ERC-1155）投保，还是为描述 NFT 的元数据投保，或者是为图像本身（JPEG）投保？\n* 您是否能够保证 Token、元数据和 JPEG 总是可以访问？\n* 您是否能够保证元数据和 JPEG 没有被破坏？\n\n这些问题可能会导致对数据存储方式有进一步的需求。如果完全在链上，那么丢失的风险较低。而如果 Token 在链上，但 JPEG 在一个集中的服务器上，那么风险更大，也许保费溢价更高。\n\n## 被动收益率与NFT有关还是来自于二次销售的版税？\n\n如果NFT有一种收益形式，那么投保人可能更希望有[收入保障保险](https://www.abi.org.uk/products-and-issues/choosing-the-right-insurance/income-protection/)，这可能会导致需要持有单独的保单或更广泛的范围和更高的保费。\n\n如果无法获得[版税](https://cyberscrilla.com/nft-royalties-what-are-they-and-how-do-they-work/)或者由于合约错误导致版税停止，可能也会造成经济损失，因此持有者还应该考虑保护自己免受智能合约失败的影响。\n\n而对于那些经过核实和审计的合约，投保人的保费可能会减少，从而促进行业的发展。反过来，通过降低发生索赔的风险和危险合约的普遍存在也能够使双方受益。\n\n## 这属于现有保险产品的哪一种类？\n\n标准的[商业财产保险](https://www.abi.org.uk/products-and-issues/choosing-the-right-insurance/business-insurance/commercial-property-insurance/)是由 \"承保财产 \"的 \"直接实物损失 \"引发的。而 NFT 鉴于其无形的属性不属于这一类别。\n\nNFT 保险可以被归类为现有[网络安全保险](https://www.abi.org.uk/products-and-issues/choosing-the-right-insurance/business-insurance/cyber-risk-insurance/)的延伸，其中也可能包括在发生针对项目方的法律诉讼时为其提供[专业赔偿保险](https://www.abi.org.uk/products-and-issues/choosing-the-right-insurance/business-insurance/liability-insurance/professional-indemnity-insurance/)。\n\n## 是否可以通过保险单来降低执行风险？\n\n大多数人对于项目的路线图交付（[执行风险](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/finance/articles/cfo-insights-execution-risk-wheel-of-woe.html)）通常会有极大的担忧，即使大家对于项目路线图交付的定义有些主观，但还是避免不了 \"[Rug-pull](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/rug-pull)\" 这个词被广泛使用。为此，[担保债券](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/surety.asp)是一个可能的解决方案，通过保险来弥补未来工作承诺无法交付时产生的损失。\n\n## 不是你的私钥，不是你的加密资产？\n\n持有者是否能够在死后将加密资产转让给继承人/受益人是另一个考虑。如果没有私钥，那么就无法控制加密资产。因此这是否也会成为保险单中的一项条款，在保险事件发生时免除保险公司的责任？各方的合约责任需要清晰地写在写入到合同条款中，以评估任何一方的是否有某些行为可能被忽视而导致保单无效。\n\n[Michael Giusti](https://www.insurancethoughtleadership.com/michael-giusti)（[insurancequotes.com](https://www.insurancequotes.com/)的资深作家）用现实世界资产相关的观点来类比 NFT 资产：\n\n> “*仅仅因为有人出售 NFT 资产并不意味着他们一定拥有该资产…… 就像拿着伪造的地契站在邻居家门前一样，虽然有人付了钱，但并不意味着他们现在就拥有房子。”*\n\n虽然大多数人都知道 NFT 是数字艺术收藏品，但其与现实世界资产挂钩的实际用例还有待发现。这就提出了另一个问题，被保险的对象究竟是什么—— 是现实世界资产还是代表现实世界资产的 Token？\n\n## 投保人如何合理的做尽调？\n\n投保人在索赔被拒绝的情况下需要付出非常多的努力。目前的法律框架可能还没有发展到足以提供这方面的专业知识指导。[Sharon Henley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharonhenley/?originalSubdomain=uk)（[Coincover](https://www.coincover.com/)研发副总裁）在这方面提供了一些说明性观点：\n\n> “*仔细查看 NFT 的详细信息、元数据、元数据的 URL 以及 JPEG 的 URL ，”Henley说道。“调换 URL 是一件非常容易的事情，并会造成您认为您在购买 NFT 的假象。因此需要确保在可信的网站上购买 NFT，并且需要认真检查几次相关信息。”*\n\n这会推动积极的消费者行为——如果投保人将资产存放在冷钱包中，那么保险公司可以向投保人提供折扣保费，以降低索赔风险。有个现有例子是[汽车行业通过安装黑匣子来监控驾驶行为以降低汽车的保费](https://www.thinkinsurance.co.uk/personal/young-driver-insurance/could-a-black-box-system-reduce-your-insurance-premium)，同时促进道路安全。\n\n[A1rport.Eth](https://twitter.com/a1rportEth) 提供了一个[关于 NFT 的尽调指南](https://twitter.com/a1rportEth/status/1497553411964747776)，可以作为在 NFT 领域内操作时的调研模版。\n\n## 现有的相关产品\n\n虽然目前市面上已经出现的 NFT 保险相关产品提供的保障范围和产品相对有限，但还是有所保障的。不过，这里罗列出来只是为了提供信息，并不代表任何对这些产品的认可。\n\n[Insured Finance](https://insured.finance/) 将自己定义为第一个双边数字资产保险市场，可以满足对各种数字资产的需求和为其提供保险。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XfZnlDJBlVVgEBSrGtQ5M.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\n[Nexus Mutual](https://nexusmutual.io/) 提供类似于 web2 世界中所谓的 “互助保险”。它们更是一个自治组织，发行 Token 来帮助推动其管理协议。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XhyEQ1azyKV2qLORfVdWZ.png?height=286&width=971)\n\n## 结语\n\nNFT保险这个市场需求的巨轮已经开始运转，有些保险公司已经开始通过专门从事定制风险的 [Lloyd's of London](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lloyds-london.asp) 来提供定制相关产品。这意味着 NFT 保险的索赔和出现法院确立的先例只是时间问题，反过来这也将为保险公司扩大其服务范围带来新的市场份额。在这个时代中，数据是关键，区块链提供了一种不变的，可验证的解决方案，用来利用信息爆炸时代的大量信息。\n\n虽然本文重点关注 NFT 保险这种产品，但我们也将区块链和 NFT 视为颠覆保险业的一种手段。区块链可以提高透明度、帮助人们更好地遵守法规并建立规范的产品和市场，它还可以推动消费者行为的积极变化，以更好地造福更广泛的社会。\n\n> 在 Origins NFT，我们通过数据来驱动决策、教育资源和专业分析，在区块链技术特别是 NFT 方面保持领先地位。要了解更多信息，请访问我们的 [网站](https://originsnft.io/) 或

It's sweet, light, and not warm at all. It's a lingering fragrance. Only when you sit still, be alone, and your heart sinks, you can smell the incense, floating in the air, for a while, for a while...\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AtvfBTcRaRv5z8gNwMOIb.png?height=280&width=460)\n\n\n​​\nLife is tasteful. This taste, tender. It must be a tender willow in early spring, yellow-green with worm-like buds. Just tender. When the wind blew, Liu Qingwu swayed on the shore. It is a magnolia with a white tip, no more or less, showing a small head, looking ashamed to cover it. It is also the Spring Festival on the street. Star-like embellishment of pink tender branches. Only a few flowers have seen the whole spring. The taste of life is green and tender.\n​​\nLife is tasteful. It must be an ancient temple in the deep mountains, mountain streams and clear springs, and egrets flying. It is a stone, and there is a large blank outside the mountain. This taste. is a tree and you see a forest. A drop of water, you dream of the vast sea. A blank, you see a mirage. This taste, mood, far away.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LFRGdZuzQ-FGF-bb0i4jl.png?height=280&width=328)\n\n\n​​\nLife is tasteful. It must be bluish, faint, and quiet. Yes, it is the color of lavender. Quiet, with a little melancholy. That sadness is the fragrance of the dead of night. That flower is a flash in the pan. A moment, aftertaste, endless. It is also the whiteness of the begonia, and it opens up quietly, and silence is worth a thousand words.\n​​\nLife is interesting, it must be Liu Zongyuan's lone boat, the liu, who fished for snow in the cold river alone. It is Tao Yuanming's picking chrysanthemums under the east fence, leisurely seeing Nanshan. It is a monk of Hanshan who travels to Qingshan during the day and sleeps under the rock at night. It was Du Mu's white cloud in the mirror, before the bright moon fell. It was Wang Wei who went to a place where the water was poor and sat and watched the clouds and water.\n​​\nLife is interesting, it must be pottery, simple, plump, and quiet. It has been hidden for thousands of years, and the ancient meaning that cannot be contained will be rewarded to those who understand it. It must be Song Porcelain. Light, thin, elegant, graceful. Like a woman in a cheongsam, stepping on a lotus step, she came slowly, and suddenly she passed by, pursing her lips, the laughter rippling in the watery sky.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3gXzkjTaMG6x_pSLpOpp8.png?height=280&width=427)\n\n\n​​\nLife is tasteful. This taste. It is colorless water, clear. It is the line of the ridge, soft. It is a vine on a tree, cherishing each other. It is not the love of Concubine Yang Guifei and Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. A piece of white silk was stabbed to death on Maweipo. It's not the love between Li Yu and Emperor E. After the love, the new face changed to the old one. It's not that Liu Yong and the woman in Fengyue Field fell in love and waved goodbye to the cloud of love. Nor is it Van Gogh's sunflowers, burning fervently. One piece, one piece. Not even the starry sky, rolling and roaring, full of emotions. It is the love between Lu You and Tang Wan, deep and shallow, lingering for a lifetime. It is the thoughts of Bai Juyi and Xiang Ling, their hearts mirror each other, and the earth will last forever. It is the graceful grace of Song Ci, and the small bridge and flowing water in the south of the Yangtze River.\n​​\nLife is delicious, yes, Qinghuan.\n​​\nThis Qinghuan is a little bit of red on the steamed bun. A hint of green in early spring. A touch of white in winter. It was a subtle joy, a small smile in my heart. Quietly. Only the heart knows. It is light footsteps. It's fluttering catkins. It's a nianhua smile. It's not the time when the title of the Golden List is not the bridal chamber's candle night, and it's not. This Qinghuan, thin cool, long-term, beautiful.\n​​\nThis Qinghuan is written by Dai Wangshu, the woman in a cheongsam holding an oil-paper umbrella, walking in the misty and misty alley, alone, disappearing into the depths of the alley... It is the flowering tree written by Xi Murong, Waiting for the person she loves to pass by the tree, looking back inadvertently, smiling... It was written by Haizi, facing the sea, spring flowers blooming, waiting for the clear shadow of the future...\n​​\nThis clear joy is the crispness of the water flowing in the mountains and streams in the heart of Yunshui Zen. It is the quiet beauty of the water lily dancing into the heart. It is the slow quietness of Guangling San. It is the lotus leaf He Tian Tanaka, the woman who plays the flute and sails the boat. It was an old man who lay in a lonely boat and fell asleep peacefully under the moonlight. It is a hut in the forest, a weak scholar who drinks with the moon and sings alone.\n​​\nThis is pure joy. Away from the bustling city, walk into the quiet countryside, walk alone on the hills, admire the flowers and watch the moon, and return to the poetic countryside. Away from the neon flashes, look up at the stars, look for a group of fireflies, and dance in groups around you. Cook a plate of wild vegetables, drink a cup of home-brewed wine, sit alone in the courtyard, and invite the moon to drink together. Play a flute, whisper with insects, and listen to the joy of the birds in the forest. This pastoral, that is, Qinghuan. very alone. Very quiet. Very poetic. very pure.\n​​\nLin Hejing is Qinghuan, living alone in the deep forest, with plum as his wife and crane as his son. Tao Yuanming was Qinghuan, resigned from office and returned to seclusion, and devoted himself to farming the countryside. Yu Hu is very happy, and is dependent on Baiyun every day. Lin Qingxuan is Qinghuan. Sit alone in the mountains, make a cup of good tea, enjoy the quietness of the mountains and the clear water.\n​​\nLife is delicious, yes, Qinghuan.\n​​\nThis kind of life is lonely and indifferent to the world. Even in the mortal world, keep the truth, the purity, and the beauty alone. Born from nature, go back to nature. With flowers as companions, with trees as friends, with mountains and rivers as neighbors. Enjoy the sunshine of the four seasons, love the blue sky and white clouds, the mountains and flowing water.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g1ikHNNxryOpbt8CJ59YT.png?height=270&width=397)\n\n ​​She is not like everyone else. love her love. Lonely, not lonely. Deep love, shallow joy. Be happy with your own happiness. You love me or you don't love me, I'm all there. This is pure joy. This joy is clear, and this life has a taste.

{"id": "zRwi-O61Vy0m3utn_FqBOu1q6q-mqlHZmZY2qxu_mJY", "title": "Electric companies ", "body": "Electric companies have expanded their flexible billing and payment programs during the pandemic to help customers stay current, Adam Cooper, senior director for customer solutions at the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association for investor-owned electric companies, wrote in an email. Many allow customers to enter balance billing programs, where they pay the same amount every month. This smooths out seasonal spikes in usage.\n\nThe companies also reach out to consumers suffering from financial hardships and educate them about assistance programs, such as LIHEAP, Cooper said.\n\nBut repayment plans don't always relieve the financial strain on families. Minneapolis resident Scott Norcross entered one recently so his power wouldn't be shut off after he fell a few hundred dollars behind in payments, mainly from using the air conditioner over the last few months. He now has to shell out around $100 on top of his monthly bill, which he says is three times more than it used to be prior to the pandemic.\n\n\"Our electric bill had just gone higher and higher and higher,\" said Norcross, 55, who is disabled and is affected by the heat. \"We can't really afford the extra payment, but we have to do something if we want to keep the electric on.\"\n\nNorcross, whose wife is a personal care assistant and older son works in retail, applied for energy aid but was told his family's income was $800 over the limit.\n\nSo the couple and their two young adult sons sit in their car and run the air conditioner for 20 to 30 minutes to cool off a few times a day, depending on how hot it is. The temperature climbed to at least 90 degrees on Tuesday, which would be the 13th time it's hit that level this year.", "timestamp": 1658295970, "digest": "YVAnAQ9UeGfj8lwt_2I-pYRYL3XaLERErlyyhgmJ8Es", "contributor": "0x3ecE49870Dc1e44e127061c1E71CB8c191FC78e5"}

{"id": "SkbsYPPRL-AC9UigP-an5Zqlqf_a9Xz2wPiPWfePjvk", "title": "books and times", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XnQlLxYtZYOs0nK4R8kKW.png?height=266&width=457)\n\nI have read a very time-consuming book, but it mainly depends on the level of sophistication of its content, as well as the analysis and description of the times. Every era has the same love, but different love stories. The content of the story is always greater than the elegance of the language. The more the book is branded by the era, generally speaking, it will always have a large space. That is because the era originally It is very rich, and it also shows the appearance of aristocracy in content. Good things will always stand the test of time, because there are still special characteristics given by the times, so it is impossible to erase them. It will be the most lively, like a drama. But that is history, no matter whether it is derogatory or praised, it has its meaning of existence.\n​​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/x_cM0w0NztD3ViPjAZ3jO.png?height=270&width=387)\n\n\nLooking at the world from one angle will always seem narrow, but it can know a lot of unexpected things. The world looks very big, but some things make it very small. The advent of the information age has changed the original appearance of the world. Even some ancient peoples must be extra protected, for fear that they will become unrecognizable under modernization. It's hard to imagine how curious the world is about being behind. We keep leaving the past behind, wanting to keep some memories of the past, but still ushering in a future that looks familiar. The digital age has made life what we all want it to be, and every day someone teaches us to learn a new life. There seems to be no end, but we can only run forward. This kind of life looks flashy, but it is very easy to produce fatigue, and we may never be able to go back to the simple and busy life in the past. Various realities tell us that we can learn to live only by mastering certain resources. Books will tell us how to live. No matter what books are, they are a symbol of spirit and a platform for wisdom. As long as you have ideas, you will naturally reveal them, stamp the stamp of the times, and become the best assistant to record the times. And life is a sign of the times.\n​​\nThere are more and more books to read, and there are more things that can be imagined. People are doing the process of creating the era every day. We need more things to satisfy ourselves, but we cannot satisfy the creators who are struggling on the road of surpassing themselves. What you open the window and enter into your eyes is the desire for life. It seems that it is the era. In fact, I don’t know that I am in life, but I just need the appearance outside the window. The book says that life is me and what I do, but that It is not as good as the life we ​​see. When I thought that what was outside was reality, I realized that the place where I stood is the reality. Books are not here to fight, but to tell you when you thought it was the times, it was life.\n​​\nThe world in the book is a person's world. I just feel that we should try to see our own world. What time has left us? Some things are invisible but have inner meanings that cannot be changed. People who like books may not have the same experience. We are not the protagonists. The times always create their successors, and books are the best masterpieces of the times. Because of the times, there is a culture that symbolizes the meaning of the times. We think that a person or a group of people can control the times, but the times use them to create themselves.\n​​\nIn the end, our lives are still constantly changing in the times. This is a kind of progress and a result of the times.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q7-MiIwmNN7z7z2ETr5Zb.png?height=198&width=453)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658296462, "digest": "uvb6WrFxr5o0VIMuxQLKBaunz3mBCuAYZrhDdBPJPiU", "contributor": "0x31d8F6f61478eD1c50C1264fe85F7f35D4D6049d"}

写在前面\n\n最近看到行业内一些资深人士在讨论身份与契约相关的问题，学习后收获挺大，诚挚感谢他们为此做出的努力和无私分享。在这里，我想结合最近在Web3社交网络赛道的学习和思考，进行一次梳理，一是强化所学，二是希望从身份和契约角度，结合Web3领域社交网络图谱协议的发展状况，进行一些探索和思考。\n\n## 1 在Web2.0中我们是谁\n\n互联网经历了Web1.0、Web2.0，当前正在从Web2.0迈向Web3.0，从信息互联网向价值互联网进行转移。**业界对于Web1.0、2.0及3.0普遍的表述是：Web1.0可读，Web2.0可读且可写，Web3.0可读、可写且可拥有**，如图1-1所示：\n\n![图1-1 互联网Web1.0-3.0的迭代演进](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V-By6tephxke3PqrraaoS.png?height=148&width=420)\n\n这样的迭代演进是基于底层技术架构变化而产生，而背后的驱动因素跟互联网发展到Web2.0时产生严重的中心化特征息息相关。\n\n有人这样描述：Web 1.0 范式是平台创造、平台所有、平台控制、平台受益；Web 2.0的范式是用户创造、平台所有、平台控制、平台分配。凭借着自己对技术基础设施的控制权，社交媒体平台对用户创造的数字内容拥有着完全的所有权、控制权，平台可以决定编辑、修改、删除和屏蔽用户的内容，甚至可以删掉用户的账号，将用户驱逐出其社交网络。这些数字内容所创造的价值也由平台决定如何分配。用户在使用互联网过程中产生的大量数据足迹，其价值也由平台无偿占有。\n\n正如我在[《从Web2.0到Web3.0，社交网络图谱聚合变迁三步曲》](https://mirror.xyz/dancechange.eth/pyHENE8qIIbU_sfAZRQhZoc2lo-SZ6Rp9dvM0qSHzV0)中描述的那样，我们通过注册、填写现实世界自己的相关信息，获取到中心化平台给予的一个身份，**但这个身份我们并没有自主权**。于是引发一个问题，离开了中心化平台，我们是谁？延伸一下思考，在这个现实世界中，离开了“各个中心化权威机构证明”，您还能证明您是您吗？（当然，后面这个问题不是本文讨论的重点）\n\n所以是时候做出一些改变了！\n\n## \n\n## 2 从Web2到Web3，一个“身份到契约”的运动\n\n区块链实际上是一个去中心化计算协议（Protocol），可以理解为一套代码制定的规则。特别是智能合约（Smart Contract）的出现，使得“Code is the law”成为加密世界的共识。同时，所有Web3应用都是基于区块链地址进行连接和交互，完全剥离了现实世界的身份，如国家、民族、肤色等；而地址的获取无需许可，没有职位、财富和地位等任何附加，在此你是自由和平等的。**所有基于这些基础技术框架构建的应用，就是一串串软件代码，这让我们更加认识到即将到来的Web3.0虚拟世界、元宇宙等，他们是完全建立在契约基础上的一个体系，与现实身份无关**。这颇具冲击力和想象力，让现实中追求自由、公平和渴望改变、寻找机遇的人充满期待。对此，我们是否可以说从Web2到Web3的迁移代表一种进步？**正如亨利·梅因《古代法》里的一句话：“所有进步社会的运动，到此处为止，都是一个‘从身份到契约’的运动”。**\n\n而Web3社交网络图谱协议应运而生，似乎为此而来！\n\n## 3 Web3社交网络图谱将加速构建基于契约的加密经济\n\n### \n\n### 1、Web3 DApp是一套契约规则\n\n在Web2中的应用程序表示为App,而在Web3中的应用程序表示为DApp，区别在于后者是去中心化的应用程序。而更大的区别在于，App往往代表一个软件产品（Software Product），而DApp一般被称之为软件协议（Software Protocol）。**在基于区块链的加密世界里，无论是数字资产、加密货币，或者DeFi、去中心化存储等，其背后都是一种协议，也可称之为一种契约。**\n\n做协议和做产品的思路不一样：产品聚焦在功能、服务和业务逻辑层面，考虑的是产品和用户之间的交互；而协议则是约定与其它协议或标准之间交互和协同的规则，比如通过提供代币标准ERC20、ERC1155等实现资产标准化，方便各类协议方以“统一的代币标准作为基础资产协议”进行通讯和协同。一旦形成协议（达成契约），其作用在DApp内部或者DApp之间是一致且全局穿透的，因此减少了摩擦，极大提升协议之间可组合性和可扩展性，提升资产、数字资源的传输和利用效率，激发原生创新。\n\n### 2、不同DApp是不同功能的狭义经济系统\n\n狭义经济系统是指社会再生产过程中的生产、交换、分配、消费各环节相互联系和相互作用的若干经济元素所组成的有机整体。这四个环节分别承担着若干部分的工作，分别完成特定的功能。**DApp可以是一套狭义的经济系统，这跟其底层区块链分布式账本技术实现方式有关，也跟DApp诸如代币经济（Tokenomics）模式、DAO的治理方式等运作方式有关。** 我们以BTC的分布式账本实现方式举例说明，如图3-1所示。\n\n![图3-1 围绕BTC形成的狭义经济系统](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Av8osLe6gpo-jCmsjlgqV.png?height=380&width=352)\n\n**区块链不仅仅是“技术”实现的一个分布式账本，更为重要的是创建账本的过程，其实是打造一个“经济系统”的过程**。通过“挖矿”、“记账”、“货币奖励”等规则，从一开始就将主体行为、经济活动、货币金融等诸多元素带入创建“分布式账本”的过程中，将技术、货币、主体行为及关系、信任模式、激励机制等有机融合在一起，构建起一套“去中心化信任”的新型信任机制（共识机制），打造了一个“竞争算力-生产BTC-去中心化记账-奖励分配-交换及消费”的狭义经济系统。所以说分布式账本在其运作上是一套“经济系统”，不同的区块链分布式账本就是不同的经济系统。比如BTC区块链账本就是一套围绕“BTC”进行的电子现金交易系统；ETH区块链账本是一套基于不同智能合约的行业应用系统，目前主要是金融应用系统。\n\n而这些DApp代表的经济系统都是以协议的方式实现，具有开放、无需许可、可扩展等特性，犹如一个个“乐高”，可以顺畅连接、自由组合和高效创新。这相当于不同经济系统的连接、交互和创新，促进了基于契约的Web3加密经济新业态形成和发展。\n\n### \n\n### 3、以“社交网络图谱协议+DApps”模式加速构建加密经济生态\n\n在[《从Web2.0到Web3.0，社交网络图谱聚合变迁三步曲》](https://mirror.xyz/dancechange.eth/pyHENE8qIIbU_sfAZRQhZoc2lo-SZ6Rp9dvM0qSHzV0)中我曾经分析过，在加密的原生世界里，“协议”成为核心基本要素，而人被边缘化，结果就是各个DApp可以实现数据、资产、协议的互联互通，而人却是孤立的，更别说原生的人际社交网络。而Web3社交网络图谱协议的出现则填补了这个缺失，并将在Web3加密经济建设中发挥至关重要的作用。\n\nWeb3社交网络图谱以协议的方式实现，可与各种DApp的自由组合，实现“社交网络+DApp”模式。一方面用户具有自主权，可以以“地址”在各个DApp之间交互，快速扩展个人的人际网络，进一步构建出用户与用户之间的、更大规模的社交网络图谱；另一方面，作为DApp发起的项目方，也因为跟社交网路图谱协议的结合，可以快速获得用户规模增长，渡过冷启动期，大大提升DApp商业应用价值。所以二者相互加持，相互促进，最终形成“用户规模+社交关系+DApp”的加密经济规模效应。\n\n## 4 基于契约交互，设计并构建您的Web3身份\n\n以地址跟各DApp交互，无疑剥离了用户身份，但交互过程中产生的链上数据为该地址所有，因此拥有该地址的用户就获得了数据的所有权、管理权和控制权。**这些链上数据以区块链分布式账本技术为背书，可信、可查、防篡改、防丢失，累积起来就形成用户的个人特征、社交关系和行为轨迹等，用户可以以此为自己画像，这在Web2中是很难做到的**。这样以来，用户获得了主动权，可以通过规划设计自己想要成为的样子，并基于协议（或者说契约）的方式来改变自己，在实践中不断完善“我的Web3身份”。其原理可以图4-1所示。\n\n![图4-1 基于DApp交互形成用户画像](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ppTmSe2W0Y1bo_8IOdFL6.png?height=339&width=692)\n\n下面通过使用社交网络图谱协议形成的个人主页进行具体说明，如图4-2所示。\n\n![图4-2 Web3用户个人的去中心化主页](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y6z5gtXuEFN3BTL_cr4Sa.png?height=399&width=692)\n\n这样的去中心化用户画像包括：\n\n**个人信息**：如头像、昵称、地址（包括ENS），以及用户交互或者使用过的App和DApp，如Twitter、Opensea、Rarible等，点击进去可以看到相关的资产、收藏品、操作记录等。\n\n**资产**：包括NFT、加密数字货币、凭证等；\n\n**内容**：在不同的媒体上发布的文章、聊天记录等；比如你在Mirror上发布了文章，在这里被实时记录；\n\n**行为**：在Uniswap、Opensea、Pancake等不同的DApp里的交易、转账、签名等形成用户的链上行为轨迹，可查询、可追溯；\n\n**徽章**：参加一些链上或者链下活动，举办方授予的证书，是一种用户行为记录，更表示诸如荣誉、成就之类的象征；\n\n**凭证**：以交易、转账、签名、捐赠、提案、投票等链上数据形成用户在Web3世界的行为凭证；\n\n**社交关系**：从“你关注的人”和“关注你的人”两个方面来表示个人的人际网络，从而形成社交网络图谱。\n\n**这样的画像，映射到现实中，将形成“去中心化身份”，无需多言，无需权威证明，用户链上数据完成“可信自证”--这就是“我”**。并且，随着Web3发展趋势、应用普及以及用户交互频次增长，“我”也不断成长，链上数据、资产、行为轨迹、凭证等将反哺现实世界的身份，可作为个人在资产实力、技能能力、经历阅历、圈子圈层等各方面的证明，将来可以运用到日常的个人征信、求职、金融贷款、VIP会员等方面，甚至能够改变现实中的社会地位。\n\n## 5 不同切入点和发展路径但殊途同归\n\n目前已有一些为人所知的社交网络图谱协议，如5Degrees、Cyberconnect、RSS3、Lens等，但都处于早期阶段。各个协议因为项目方的背景及定位差异，切入点不同，发展路径各异，但在构建社交网络图谱，赋能DApp，壮大Web3加密生态上应是殊途同归。\n\n以5Degrees举例。根据个人理解，我绘制了一张“5Degrees的价值圈层图”，通过直观的方式，期望表达出5Degrees的定位、协议标准、开发者生态、应用集成、生态网络、规模效应等因素的相互关系，以此梳理5Degrees的发展路径和价值实现。如图5-1所示。\n\n![图5-1 5Degrees的价值圈层图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rX2ZlSeuJQoe1F4vvE0Qk.png?height=391&width=421)\n\n作为TP钱包孵化的Web3.0社交网络基础协议，5Degrees的定位有点类似一种社交网络的“元协议”--Profile+Follow，聚焦在社交协议的基础模块构建上。我们分析这样的定位跟TP钱包有着密切的关系。作为加密世界入口的TokenPocket，是数字钱包的龙头，在流量、产品功能、生态合作等各个方面都有丰厚的资源优势和经验沉淀，这是可以直接用以孵化5Degrees的发展。那么，TokenPocket拥有的，5Degrees不必从头再来，所以越简单越好。\n\n这样简单的基础协议，具备了足够的下沉能力；同时因为采用了ERC1155标准且完全开源，不仅可以无需许可植入兼容ERC1155的协议或业务；并且因为完全开源，降低了开发门槛，可以激发更多的开发者进入，一起围绕5Degrees进行技术及应用创新；再加上基于TokenPocket创建的BTC、ETH、EOS、TRX、BSC、HECO、OKT、IOST、Polkadot、Kusama等多链生态，为5Degrees快速集成各类应用带来了可行性。以上各种因素融合在一起，相互促进，形成一个以“Profile+Follow”为中心，不断往外扩张的同心圆价值圈层，共同致力于Web3生态繁荣发展。\n\n##

写在最后\n\n**按照亨利·梅因的观点：迄今为止，一切“进步社会”的运动都是从身份到契约；但“进步社会”其实在人类历史中是很少很短的，大部分社会都不能称之为“进步社会”。**\n\n联系到互联网的发展，我们也可以理解为事物总是在矛盾运动中变化发展。从Web1到Web2的过程中，我们感受到了规模、便利和效率大幅度提升带来工作、生活各方面的好处，这个阶段可以称之为进步；而当Web2中心化平台发展到寡头垄断时，不公平竞争、价值剥削、阻碍创新等也带给人们诸多困扰；现在随着区块链及Web3应用的纵深发展，去中心化社交网络图谱协议成为联系身份和契约的纽带，推动人们从现实到虚拟的迁移，成为联系现实世界与虚拟世界的纽带，这是否代表一种进步的方向呢？**对此，我们会持续关注,不断探索，力求去伪存真、务本明理。**\n\n正如扑面而来的元宇宙，混杂着远景、投机、价值等各种气息，我们祈愿Web3最终迎来的是“面向大海，春暖花开”。",

{"id": "a0neE0R0cFjcYRe_fZaWXZ4YGqrj1OZIpkMj51vfsag", "title": "The State of Filecoin", "body": "As the centralized services have become an increasingly critical part of how we live our lives online, so the need for alternatives becomes ever greater. Humanity will need a better internet that can harness the web infrastructure far more efficiently. That’s where [Filecoin](https://www.filecoin.com/) comes in, let’s dig in!.\n\n# Demystifying Filecoin\n\nInternet is increasingly centralized, fragile and inefficient. Most cloud storage services are provided by companies that have absolute control ([centralized data monopolies](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/amazon-web-services-outage-cloud-b1762074.html)) over the data stored on their servers and suffers from vulnerable choke-points (poor data safety).\n\nThis model requires users to trust the service provider. [They must trust the company](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-report.html) to not modify the stored data nor censor them by denying access to the service. Furthermore, the users have no way of verifying that the data has not been manipulated since it was uploaded unless they have a copy of the original data.\n\nThanks to its decentralized nature, the power of the network lies in its community. Filecoin itself isn't the gatekeeper for storage, the community is. In short, Filecoin allows anyone to rent-out free space on their computer to other users who are looking to store data. It can be thought as similar to the Airbnb model, which allows anyone to rent out a room in their house or even the entire house. \n\nFilecoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer network that allows its users to store and retrieve data on the internet, robust foundation to store the world most valuable data sets and alternative to conventional cloud storage services. An alternative to costly cloud storage with open platform and a market economy that allowing users to take advantage (store, request, and transfer data) of its unmatched network capabilities via a verifiable marketplace.\n\nThe four key features that Filecoin bundles together:\n\n1. **Connects clients with storage providers**\n\n   Clients and storage providers make deals (i.e., storage agreements) to store or retrieve data using [FIL as the medium of exchange](https://docs.filecoin.io/about-filecoin/how-filecoin-works/); connects people who have excess storage space with people who want to store data, efficiently priced (minimizing financial barriers) and geographically decentralized storage.\n2. **The network is completely [open-source](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community#forums)**\n\n   Enabling people from all over the world to participate, meaning that anyone can store data on the network or become a storage provider. The price of storage depends on supply and demand.\n3. **Built on [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/)**\n\n   Using Filecoin directly requires technical skills, protocols can be built on top of Filecoin and IPFS ([adds economic incentives to store files on IPFS](https://docs.filecoin.io/about-filecoin/ipfs-and-filecoin/)). These protocols make interacting with the blockchain easier.\n4. **The Filecoin protocol runs on an advanced and novel proof system**\n\n   A blockchain that incentivizes its miners (i.e. node operators) to store other users data in return for block rewards paid in Filecoin (FIL) tokens using a combination of [Proof of Spacetime (PoSt) and Proof of Replication (PoRep)](https://filecoin.io/filecoin.pdf), to provide unmatched efficiency and reliability. The miners store data and have to provide frequent cryptographic proofs for it. Users can verify that their data is stored correctly by looking at the cryptographic proofs on the blockchain.\n\nOver the previous decade, advances in blockchain technology have enabled applications that were not possible before. Storing valuable data including sensitive information on another machine may appear suspicious at first glance. It is feasible to establish a large-scale data storage network utilizing modern blockchain technology, where it is practically difficult to modify the stored data without breaking the chain.\n\nWith Filecoin, they breaks down the data before storing it to ensure that attackers cannot access the data saved by anyone anywhere in the network. As a result, if a malicious actor attempts to access a file stored in the system, they will only see nonsensical data fragments.\n\n![How the Filecoin network operates](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/msIY7ysRjR7zTdVnq7Rp_.png?height=705&width=1160)\n\nThere is an enormous amount of data information available, and it is critical to be able to authenticate its veracity. For example, government documents, laws and other legal documents, scientific data and reports, cultural heritage, etc. Moreover, many people’s trust in institutions, governments, and companies has diminished, creating a demand for trustless ways of storing data.\n\nThe global cloud storage market is dominated by large tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. These companies’ cloud infrastructure services’ combined yearly revenue exceeds 100 billion USD, although this number includes both storage and computing.\n\n![Circulating market caps of notable cloud storage services built on blockchain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dA2cYo9tiamfBVXAWz25A.png?height=832&width=1456)\n\nFilecoin competes with large tech companies, conventional tech startups, and other blockchain protocols. Its on-chain competitors include Akash Network, Arweave, Siacoin, and Storj. Filecoin is the largest cloud storage service built on blockchain as measured by storage capacity or valuation, but how much do we have to play with?\n\n## F\\*undamentalizatorrrr\n\nFilecoin generates revenue by charging fees for computation, storage, and transactions on the blockchain. The fees are paid in FIL. A fraction of the fees are burnt to reduce the supply of FIL, while the remaining is paid to miners. Potential future revenue streams for storage providers may include other fees, such as fees from smart contract apps or decentralized compute services. \n\n![Distribution of FIL](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tf0WwlCdqdaXbWL7cgp2T.png?height=832&width=1456)\n\nThe maximum supply of FIL is 2 billion, of which 220 million are in circulation. As indicated in the diagram above, the tokens are allocated to miners, Protocol Labs, investors, and the Filecoin Foundation. Protocol Labs, investors, and the Filecoin Foundation are on a 6-year linear vesting schedule. The miners will receive the tokens allocated to them as block rewards over several decades depending on network usage. The price of FIL, shown in the figure below, peaked in April 2021 and has since fallen near its ICO price.\n\n![Price of FIL](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EksswnGvRZd6IjjWZK2ZQ.png?height=413&width=992)\n\nThe figure below shows Filecoin’s circulating market cap (i.e. the amount of FIL in circulation multiplied by its price) and total revenue (i.e. fees paid). Filecoin’s revenue also peaked in April 2022 with 264% growth as active storage deals grew 128% and network storage capacity grew 7%. However it’s still whopping 74% lower on year-over-year basis.\n\n![Filecoin’s circulating market cap and total revenue](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jgSxnEfvMJwP8Gy9zX9of.png?height=439&width=994)\n\nFilecoin’s relatively low current revenue is partially explained by a [protocol upgrade](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-v13-hyperdrive-network-upgrade-unlocks-10-25x-increase-in-storage-onboarding/) that increased the blockchain throughput by an order of magnitude (a mechanism to scale throughput to 10–25x of its original capacity) and by the Chinese authorities’ crackdown on cryptocurrency mining. \n\nA key implication protocol upgrade was that storage proofs were aggregated, which significantly reduced congestion and freed up blockspace. While the protocol upgrade benefited most network participants, it hurt the protocol revenue because it led to a reduction in transaction fees.\n\nThe network’s storage capacity has also kept growing, increasing the supply of storage and reducing its cost. The figure below shows how the fees are split between the protocol (i.e. FIL tokenholders) and supply-side participants (i.e. miners). Burning a portion of the fees is comparable to a share buyback and thus counted as protocol revenue, although, supply-side revenue decreased 4% in FIL terms year-over-year, corresponding to a 48% decline in USD terms. Near-zero storage fees impacted supply side revenue since it limited storage providers revenue to just block rewards and tips. \n\n![Distribution of revenue between the protocol and supply-side participants.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YCkCMc-rG2o_u61Kx82IO.png?height=832&width=1456)\n\nRegardless of overall market conditions, Filecoin’s committed storage capacity has [grown steadily during the past year](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-news-46/) reached over 17.8EiB. This network capacity is equivalent to more than centralized entity. Filecoin’s storage capacity is supplied by over 4,000 decentralized storage providers distributed around the globe (supply dynamics tell only one side of the story about the network activity. The other side is told through Filecoin demand in the context of actively stored data).\n\n## Catasthrope\n\nFilecoin continue to onboard demand, it stands a chance to be a prominent provider of decentralized storage and cloud services for Web3 and traditional apps. While decentralized storage is still in its early days, the Filecoin ecosystem continues to thrive, as over +1460 projects are currently being built on Filecoin. Filecoin is being leveraged by several use cases, including:\n\n* NFTs\n* Web3\n* Gaming\n* Metaverse \n* Audio/Video.\n\nIn the future, the adoption of decentralized storage solutions and the integration of smart contracts built on top may open the door to novel applications. Open data initiatives and decentralized compute may enable the next generation of apps beyond storage. Filecoin’s main goal is to prove its reliability as a storage provider and potentially become an enabler of a wide range of data-intensive services.", "timestamp": 1658296792, "digest": "eJdFnJsUD1vNF8pV9zMEfU3v8DZMDkdS7M-kN7RY_ms", "contributor": "0xb5e04FA0Ef320DbBeeFf49E1c05FA5cE5725757D"}

{"id": "uCJQXY3kloOMT99BO7uyWJRi7sEdcduEQcJA8WwVZ4c", "title": "从Web2.0到Web3.0，社交网络图谱聚合变迁三步曲", "body": "## .1.Web2.0垄断的另一面：聚际必散\n\n**当互联网从Web1.0走向Web2.0，从只可读、以内容为中心的“信息门户”转变得可读可写可交互，开始体现出“社交网络”的特征**；并且随着大数据算法、索引推荐等技术的不断优化，社交网络媒体变得更加智能和具有粘性，这种变化不仅加速了用户、数据的持续集中和沉淀，也加速了个人及企业“朋友圈”在同一社交平台的形成和壮大，交织出强大的社交网络图谱。\n\n以“社交网络图谱”为核心，Web2.0社交网络平台成为了各类产品、服务以及行业KOL进行信息传递、价值布道、品牌建设、营销传播、粉丝互动、流量变现等的主战场。至此，“社交网络平台”成为Web2.0的圣杯，并以其庞大的用户规模、强关联的社交关系、海量的大数据等为资源，假以各种智能新兴技术，被挖掘出巨大的商业价值，成就了诸如Facebook、Twitter、微信等超万亿规模的商业帝国。\n\n毋庸置疑，社交网络在互联网Web2.0时期发挥出了巨大的商业价值，但随着“中心化”特征愈加明显，用户丧失个人数据自主权，资源垄断扼杀小微创新，大数据算法“杀熟”等等问题越来越受到谴责和质疑。不断有人发声“天下苦Web2.0久矣”，打破这种局面逐渐成为越来越强烈的共识。\n\n区块链及Web3.0的出现，为“破局”带来希望的曙光。随着区块链及Web3.0的出现，去中心化和中心化之间产生了强烈的碰撞，去中心化思想和技术已经表现出强大的创造力和“破坏性”，并从Web2.0底层开始解构。越来越多的人开始认识到，Web2.0社交网络必然走向“聚际必散”，那么以区块链为底层技术，**在Web3.0发展趋势之下，社交网络会发生怎样的变化，是否会给带来更大的想象空间？**\n\n## .2.理想丰满 ，但现实有点尴尬\n\n### 1.DApp+中心化平台=割裂的业务闭环\n\nBTC的出现带来了加密数字货币的创新和区块链的发展，而ETH作为通用的智能合约和去中心化应用平台，则将创新延展到了更广泛的商业应用领域。特别是DeFi、GameFi、NFT以及元宇宙的相继火爆，似乎让人看到了Web3.0 DApp发展的春天。\n\n各类DApp一方面致力于专业应用上的创新，同时也格外重视社区的发展，可以说社区建设成为DApp健康发展的基本要素。但我们发现，诸如Uniswap、Compound、YFI这类现象级应用，他们的社区用户几乎都是集聚在Twitter 、Telegram、Discord、微信等第三方中心化的社交网络平台。DApp的用户似乎已经习惯在Twitter上去追踪项目方动态，在Discord里聊聊跟代币经济有关的话题，在项目方微信群里进行大水漫灌。而当要进行抵押、借贷、提供流动性等操作时，还是不得不回到DApp的操作界面里去。至今，没有一个DApp能够做到基于自身业务层面建立完整的业务闭环。就如某知名钱包创始人讲到过，虽然Web3.0网络可以实现用户的数据确权，但是确权的数据离开了网络和关系，价值将会受到巨大的损失，因此用户和项目方还是难以离开web2.0平台。\n\n割裂的业务闭环，显而易见的弊端是用户群体都被封闭在中心化的社交网络平台，社群无法自由迁移，在某些情况下很可能被中心化平台“制裁”而毫无还手之力！\n\nDApp需要在中心化社交媒体中建立用户群体，这对于倡导去中心化的Web3来说，是极具讽刺的事情！究其根本原因是--加密世界缺乏原生的、无需许可的去中心化社交网络。很显然，这是一个问题，当然也是一次难得的机遇。\n\n### 2.加密世界缺失原生的社交网络\n\nWeb2.0时代的产品和服务主要是围绕“用户需求”而展开，这是商业价值最后落地的闭环，所以“人”在其中占据核心地位，因此社交网络得到显著重视和卓越发展。\n\n**而在Web3.0中，“协议”成为核心基本要素**，首要考虑如何建立机器、软件之间的信任和互联互通。“中心化、信任以及许可”，这些特征似乎都跟人或由人组成的机构密切相关，而“去中心化、去信任以及无需许可”从一开始就把人边缘化了（当然这是策略问题，最终还是为了服务于人），加密世界倡导“Code is the law”，带来的结果就是：货币协议化，实现了资产层面的广泛连接；链上行为智能合约化（协议化），实现了协议的自由组合和可扩展；底层基础设施层协议化，构建了可信网络、可信计算和可信存储，从互联网底层实现了可信的互联互通。但作为“人”或者“人际网络”，在原生的加密世界，似乎已经丢失了他的主体地位。我们认可Web3.0去中心化的思想，所以可以去掉人的“中心化主导”，但不是要去掉人这个“主体”。我们非常清楚，离开了人，这个世界的意义在哪里？\n\n当前，借力中心化社交网络平台的高效支撑，DApp的发展仍然十分迅猛，但谁能确保“中心化”不作恶？Web3.0去中心化的目的不就是要减少中心化风险吗？所以是时候关注去中心化社交网络的发展了。\n\n## .3.在去中心化状态下的“精准狙击”\n\nWeb2.0是典型的中心化平台经济，平台“一对多”聚合着生态各方。因为中心化的特征，平台在资源、效率、用户流量等方面具有单边优势，因此掌握着“话筒”的话语权。对于App来说，利用好这种优势可以在引导用户流量转化、营销传播等方面获得巨大的加持。\n\n但是Web3.0因为去中心化，首先去掉了“平台”这个中心，使得资源、资产、用户等呈现分布式、碎片化状态，相互关系变成“点对点”，每个碎片似乎变得“孤立、游离”。在这种情况下，DApp如何形成凝聚力？\n\n这就需要依靠共识！在区块链引发的加密世界里，共识是一切的基础，具有强大的力量，正如网络上流行的一句话：SX的共识也是共识。那么共识怎么获得呢？当然，一切围绕“利益”而展开。\n\n“话筒”移交到了DApp的生态社区，这是一个利益相关者形成的自治网络。无论是开发者、投资方、贡献者还是用户，每个参与者都是利益相关者，这是一种精准的“颗粒度”。很显然Web3.0试图化解Web2.0中心化带来的风险，同时也丧失了中心化资源规模优势，却捕获了利益相关者，这算不算是“精准狙击”呢？而接下来要做的，就是找到一把“狙击枪”，将这些分散但精准的“颗粒”连接起来，并变得有效，推动形成强大的去中心化共识力量。我们认为，时值DApp发展在即，唯有去中心化社交网络图谱在围绕“人”勾织协议网络，并无需许可集成到DApp中，赋能DApp社交属性，将堪当重任。\n\n## .4.社交网络图谱聚合变迁三步曲\n\n接下来，我们以图形化的方式来表达社交网络从Web2.0到Web3.0的聚合变迁。\n\nWeb2.0社交网络平台凭借着自己对技术基础设施的控制权，牢牢把控了平台数据的所有权、控制权和价值分配权，如图4-1所示：\n\n![图4-1 Web2.0社交网络平台的运作模式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1SmIfJRPU0uzmJJxoUrId.png?height=774&width=750)\n\n其优势来自于底层技术结构的“中心化”支撑，所以解决“将所有权还给用户”这个问题的核心是如何去掉中心化的平台。但去掉中心化的平台，在操作上并不是直接去解构它，而是从建设社交网络图谱之初，不再依赖于中心化平台，而是自下而上的进行，这种感觉有点像“悄悄的进村，打枪的不要”。不依赖中心化的平台，意味着从一开始用户身份、内容以及社交关系等数据资源是分布、游离、碎片化的，不仅用户之间相互失去关联，用户的数据也会跟用户自己失去关联。但这是去中心化迈出的第一步，如图4-2所示。\n\n![图4-2 第一步：去掉中心化平台后用户数据的状态](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bzURnhaaRi5-vApD855dZ.png?height=751&width=664)\n\n很显然这不是我们想要的结果。怎么办呢？中心化平台是通过注册，填写用户昵称、头像、电话以及邮件等授予用户一个平台内的身份，这个身份其实也不真正属于用户。而在Web3.0中却是利用区块链地址去唯一标识用户，用户的身份、内容、数字资产、社交关系、链上行为都跟这个地址关联。只要拥有这个地址的私钥，你就拥有这个地址的一切数据，从而再次建立起用户跟自己身份、数据的关联。这是第二步，如图4-3所示。\n\n![图4-3 第二步：用区块链地址标识并关联用户身份和数据](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yn2w5Vfq8RJDruLJPmWVE.png?height=908&width=678)\n\n至此，中心化平台已经不能任意的控制用户的身份和数据了，用户已经获得自主权，可以控制、管理自己的链上数据，但仍未展现出“去中心化社交网络图谱”最基本的原型，因为用户之间还未建立联系和交互。就如Uniswap、Compound、AAVE这些现象级的DeFi应用，虽然拥有大量的用户，但项目方仍然需要回到Twitter、微信这样的中心化平台去获取用户、运营社区，而用户之间也不能在Dapp业务层面直接交流互动。\n\n接下来需要解决的问题就变得显然，就是如何建立起用户之间的“去中心化社交关系”，从而呈现“去中心化社交网络图谱”原型。这里介绍的就是目前大多数社交网络协议采用的方法--NFT模块化。这是第三步，如图4-4所示。\n\n![图4-4 第三步：以NFT模块化用户身份、数据和社交关系](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fI8qrJNCLtam2LMrGYViN.png?height=833&width=650)\n\nNFT是非同质化代币（Non-Fungible Token）的缩写,意思是每一个Token都是不一样的。这种特性非常适合将用户地址、身份、创作的内容、链上行为、数字资产以及社交关系等链上数据整体打包为一个NFT，不仅将“所有权还给用户”，真正实现用户拥有、用户控制，并且可以随着用户链上数据、行为变化而动态变化。更重要的是，NFT本身是加密数字资产，可以实现用户身份及数据资产化，继而参与流通和交易，为用户创造价值、价值变现和获得价值分配开启一条有效的途径。\n\n**在这里，去中心化社交网络图谱包含三个基本的组成部分，即Profile（身份）、Follower（关注者）以及Following（关注）：**\n\n* Profile用NFT表达为ProfileNFT,包含用户地址、个人信息、创作内容以及数字资产等；\n* 而Follower NFT记录了他人关注你而产生的社交关系,如张三以地址A关注了你，张三就铸造了一个跟地址A关联的你的Follower NFT;这个NFT被张三拥有，但你可以控制发行数量及内容等。\n* Following NFT则记录你关注别人而产生的社交关系，你拥有的Following NFT数量代表你关注了多少其他人。\n\n通过以上三步，我们构建出“用户身份+好友关系”的去中心化社交网络图谱基本原型。基于这个原型，社区用户可以开始构建属于自己的社交网络，内容创作者可以发布拥有版权并获得价值分配的创作内容，开发者则可以专注DApp的开发，并无需许可集成社交网络图谱而快速获得用户规模增长。当然这个原型要对用户、开发者更友好，功能更强大，则需要基于其上添加其他“乐高”模块，这部分内容将在其他文章中详细分析，请关注公众号BluemountainLabs发布的相关内容。\n\n## .5.展望：社交网络图谱将为DApp带来强劲增长\n\n我们引用一张架构图以帮助读者更好地理解社交网络图谱协议在整个加密行业中所处的位置,并对社交网络图谱协议对DApp的作用进行总结性的梳理。\n\n![图5-1 加密行业整体架构图（图片来自IOBC Capital）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vykb-zi4JeQfX-1K0ae78.png?height=535&width=1001)\n\n在如图5-1所示“加密行业整体架构”的拼图中，从下往上各个层级仍在持续扩展和完善，去中心化社交网络图谱是整个拼图中非常重要的基础组件，并在去中心化身份（DID）、数据所有权、社交关系、价值传导等方面为DApp注入新的生命力，赋能DApp的发展。\n\n1. **用户拥有去中心化统一身份**\n\n   在Web2.0中，用户并不真正拥有自己的身份。每个产品的账户信息都是孤立的，用户必须在每个网站或应用程序上创建数十个账户和密码对，不安全、无法迁移、不方便且低效。\n\n   在诸如5Degrees、Cyberconnect这样的Web3.0社交网络协议中，提供了Profile NFT，以此建立统一的去中心化身份系统，不再依赖于任何应用平台。Profile NFT是一种表达身份概况信息的NFT，其包含了钱包地址、头像、昵称、Twitter账户、邮箱地址以及个人资料等，用户可以编辑、控制自己的Profile NFT，拥有完全的自主权。\n2. **将数据所有权还给用户**\n\n   Web2.0社交网络都是从其中心化数据库中读取数据，用户的个人资料、创建的内容和社交关系将存储在特定网络中并归运营商所有，缺乏可移植性和可控性。\n\n   去中心化社交网络中，个人数据和资产是跟钱包地址关联的。当用户跟某一个中心化平台或去中心化DApp交互时，产生新的数据，这些数据虽然也跟平台和DApp有关，但会成为跟该钱包地址紧密关联的数据记录。这些数据记录可以在该地址对应的浏览器中查询，也可以授权一些专门的数据或者资产管理平台进行管理，成为个人拥有的行为、数据或者资产记录。\n3. **数据资产化**\n\n   用户身份、个人资料、创作内容以及社交关系等作为跟用户强关联的数据，如果不能整体化，是很难释放出数据的价值。而去中心化社交网络图谱本质上是一个用户数据所有权协议，通过该协议可以将用户核心数据资产化（即NFT化），以此将数据所有权还给用户，打开用户捕获价值的空间，也为DApp创新带来更多可行性。\n4. **价值创造和分配**\n\n   去中心化社交图谱协议让用户数据资产化，使得用户主动创造具有所有权和控制权的数据资产变得可行，并在数据资产流通中获得收益分配。比如迈克尔•乔丹限量发行1000个超级VIP Profile NFT，每个NFT需要10万美金铸造。一方面迈克尔•乔丹实现个人数据资产总价值1亿美金的回报；另一方面，授权NFT铸造者某些商业运作权利，并规定从商业回报中获取10%的利润分配。\n5. **开放的社交网络**\n\n   中心化社交网络在跨平台社交方面是封闭的，具体表现比如Meta（原Facebook）中的用户身份和社交关系是无法直接带入微信朋友圈的，跨越平台，意味着身份和关系重建。\n\n   在去中心化社交图谱中，用户可以因为自己和他人关注而铸造出Follower NFT和Following NFT，形成用户拥有和控制的社交关系网络。用户可以添加、修改、删除、授权相关内容和权限，并自由地在各种DApp之间转移自己的社交网络，真正做到“我创建、我拥有、我控制、我收益”。\n6. **Web2.0的用户迁移桥梁**\n\n   Web3.0是未来，Web2.0是现实，Web3.0的发展不应也不能抛开Web2.0而独立发展，相反Web2.0的“他山之石”可以“攻Web3.0之玉”。\n\n   去中心化社交网络可以担当起Web2.0与Web3.0用户迁移的桥梁。比如在5Degees中可以看到“Web3.0社交桥梁”这一应用，这是Web2.0 用户（如Twitter用户）进入Web3.0的门户，也为现有的Web3.0用户提供了将Web2.0人脉资源连接到Web3.0 的渠道。\n\n   成功的用户获取和留存可以显著提高Web3系统对开发人员和贡献者的内在激励，从而为系统带来更大的价值、最终吸引更多的用户等。\n7. **聚合链上链下数据**\n\n   去中心化社交网络还可以聚合链上链下数据。比如Cyberconnect Indexer可以索引来自IPFS网络、区块链网络（如Ethereum和Solana）的原始数据，并从Rarible、Twitter、NFTBank等平台获取链下数据。从而为DApp构建完整的数据图谱。\n8. **社交网络+DApp**\n\n   去中心化社交网络图谱作为基础组件协议有助于推动“社交网络+”模式，加速与多链生态各种应用集成。各类初创DApp借助社交图谱可以快速获得用户，完成冷启动，从而只需专注于应用的构建。同时各类现象级DApp背后都有巨大流量，所以去中心化社交图谱集成DApp其实就是增加商业渠道，批量引流，快速扩大社交网络规模，相互形成正向循环。\n\n最后，我们还是需要提醒一下，虽然去中心化社交网络是目前的热门赛道，受到越来越多的投资方和开发者的重视，出现了诸如5Degrees、Lens Protocol、Cyberconnect、RSS3、Relation等不错社交网络图谱协议，其发展前景可期。但目前该赛道仍然处于初期阶段，在用户规模、进入门槛、用户友好、应用场景等方面还有很大的提升空间，去中心化还有相当长的路要走。这个赛道跟整个加密行业一样，每天都在快速变化，风险和机遇并存，困难与成就随行。作为web3.0社交网络的研究和实践者，我们会持续关注该领域项目及团队的进展，努力为大家呈现出清晰的概念以及演化路径。当然，文中若有陈述有误、表达不清或者有异议的地方也欢迎大家批评指正，期待与您一起收获行业发展和自我成长的价值。",

If this is the case, why do it? Stop it, a finite life cannot be an infinite waste of time.\n\nworry\n\nBeing mediocre is embarrassing yourself, making yourself tense and worrying every day, and it will only make you physically and mentally exhausted. There will always be variables in life, there will always be wind and rain, and no one can predict everything in advance. So, instead of worrying and worrying about yourself, it is better to let yourself live every day with ease, let nature take its course, face everything calmly, and don’t let worry imprison your body and your heart.\n\ncomplain\n\nA life full of complaints will gradually drift away from happiness. Dissatisfaction with the environment, dissatisfaction with others, dissatisfaction with fate, dissatisfaction with reality, and finally dissatisfaction with your own choices and decisions... Complaining will weaken your strength to struggle, hinder your progress, and make you fall into negative emotions and cannot extricate yourself. . Try to let yourself face all the wind and rain bravely and calmly, accept every decision you make, even if the process is full of hardships, don't give up easily, let alone hold back and feel sorry for yourself.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DpTOOCOyyGvEz8CMLd6O4.png?height=266&width=420)\n\ncomplain\n\nWhen things go wrong, blame others first; if things go wrong, complain about conditions first. This is a passive attitude towards life and a manifestation of lack of responsibility. Complaining doesn't help at all, it just makes you lose sight of your own problems and your mistakes. Smart people will know how to reflect on themselves first and find answers from themselves. Only with this positive attitude to face the problems encountered in life can you learn lessons, gain experience, and make you go more smoothly in your future life.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e__fpckfYEaewDO-DiHgJ.png?height=266&width=420)\n\nCompare\n\nIn life, it is the right way to feel happy or unhappy, satisfied or unsatisfied, or happy or unhappy. Don't get caught up in constant comparisons with others, don't disrupt your pace because of others. Everyone has their own opportunities and blessings, and they will also encounter their own ups and downs. Don’t compare the achievements and glory of others with your own, don’t blindly follow or imitate other people’s lifestyles and forget your original intentions and pursuits.

All new building permits fell 0.6% from May while single-family permits dropped more significantly by 8%. Compared to a year ago, all permits are actually up 1.4%, but those for single-family homes are down 11.4%\n\nMulti-family building continues on largely because rents are so high.\n\n\"Given that nationwide rents have grown by 14% or more year-over-year in each month of 2022 so far and that active for-sale inventory is 28% higher than last year, it's unsurprising that builders are currently more keen on multi-family rental construction,\" said Berner.\n\nThis construction slowdown comes even as the price of lumber bottomed out in June, Berner said. But the relief in those prices might not last long.\n\n\"With lumber prices creeping back up in July and homebuyer demand being stifled by the rising cost of financing a home purchase, it's unlikely that much progress will be made toward closing the housing supply gap any time soon,\" Berner said. \"In the meantime, prospective first-time homebuyers who are taking a pause from their search may find more options to rent if multifamily projects continue to receive more attention from builders.\"", "timestamp": 1658297311, "digest": "7c3re5qpUJScxKJ1rQNqWK1Ct2jrBlQdGJIGspUIuhQ", "contributor": "0xE9766E1F4CD287484654BC879Db82c46d5fF579E"}

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index is meant to gauge market conditions and looks at current sales, buyer traffic and the outlook for sales over the next six months.\n\n* \n\n\"Production bottlenecks, rising home building costs and high inflation are causing many builders to halt construction because the cost of land, construction and financing exceeds the market value of the home,\" said Jerry Konter, NAHB chairman and a home builder and developer from Savannah, Georgia.\n\n* \n\nThe building slowdown comes as rising mortgage rates and home prices continue to discourage potential buyers, said Joel Berner, senior economic research analyst for Realtor.com.", "timestamp": 1658297280, "digest": "B9h7IARkOf-_zew5EU0Nl_iIgO0AMOCJN9npaGFh02k", "contributor": "0xFFcAEfb9A25AC5ec0FC0EB1029235519F906dd15"}

Housing inventory was already extremely tight, pushing home prices higher.

The norm is around 3 to 4 months, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\"Homebuilders have been facing supply-chain disruptions and many homes started multiple months ago have yet to be completed,\" said Yun. \"Homebuilders are waiting to see how these homes will sell before starting new construction.\n\n* \n\nBut overall affordability constraints may push more buyers into renting, he said.\n\n\"Housing supply challenges will continue in the coming months and into next year,\" said Yun.", "timestamp": 1658297346, "digest": "J9Nhj0J6s3GhhP7ZS8szULAngHqmN0-bnPIDgTF4Qrg", "contributor": "0xA21B339380bac0fd112f62Ab066041AAad109B00"}

Your own life has piled up, and you have to finish hers. You head to the manager's room, ready to explode.\n​​\nYou bought a ticket to watch it with your family, but the dark clouds above your head are getting thicker and thicker, which disrupts your plans. Your child is disappointed, and you curse God for ruining your day.\n​​\nIt would be great if you could control your emotions and get rid of these or other similar things that might happen, wouldn't it? It's natural to feel annoyed when things don't go as planned. But often, we overreact and create a domino effect that keeps us from seeing the bright side of things.\n​​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1zgY1108W-J7pWvC9b0vR.png?height=270&width=390)\n\n\nFormer world heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman had a good point: \"Being angry and unhappy with someone is like letting it live in your head for free.\"\n​​\nControlling emotions is a challenge for people of all ages. But it's totally doable! You are the only one directly responsible for your emotions. You are responsible for your actions and responses, and no one can make you respond a certain way.\n​​\n\"The greatest discovery of my generation is that people can change the outer aspects of their lives by changing the inner attitude of their minds.\" The American philosopher William James once said at the end of the 19th century. Obviously, this problem has existed for a long time.\n​​\nFortunately, there are some very effective ways to manage your emotions. Of course, this takes practice. But the payoff is unmistakable, and you will thank yourself for it. Here are a few areas to practice:\n​​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dlP3XfHgpl8iDlptW7037.png?height=270&width=373)\n\n1. Develop good self-care habits. Take care of your physical, emotional and spiritual needs. People who do this regularly will be better able to deal with negativity. And will not pose a threat to others.\n   ​​\n2. Identify feelings of anger and frustration - mentally and physically. The chances of acting recklessly are much greater if one is disconnected from one's own feelings.\n   ​​\n3. Get out of the tension and go for a walk. Take the necessary time to process feelings and emotions. Time may be enough for a deep breath, or a slow count of 10.\n   ​​\n4. Confess your emotions to those who are willing to listen but not judge.\n   ​​\n5. Find a temporary distraction to do. This refers to doing something that gets your mind off the topic.\n   ​​\n6. Take action. Think about how you can positively change the situation, and then take action to solve the problem.\n   ​​\n7. Talk to those who can help you achieve change about your desire to make a change.\n   ​​\n8. The mind should be \"right\", not \"wrong\".\n   ​​\n   Here is a story worth thinking about: a shop run by a gardener, handed down by their family for generations. It is remembered that this generation of shop owners and previous generations were very positive people. Most people think it's because they run a successful store. In fact, the opposite is true.\n   ​​\n   The shop has a tradition that the owner always wears a large badge on the lapel with the words \"Business is good\" on it. Although they are going through tough times just like everyone else, the attitude and badge of the shopkeeper never change.\n   ​​\n   When everyone sees this badge for the first time, they all ask, \"How good is the business?\"\n   ​​\n   After the badge sparked a conversation, the flower shop owner would tell a lot about the positive aspects of his business and work. Even people who feel miserable will feel much happier after listening to a few minutes of this infectious and optimistic shopkeeper.\n   ​​\n   It's hard to give a measure of this attitude, but in a way, it may be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Sometimes I occasionally step into a teahouse not far from my home to feel the different leisure and elegance.\n​​\nThe tea is fragrant and the guzheng is lingering. There are many people who come here to taste tea, including some urban young people. They wear masks in their daily life and experience too much flattery, intrigue, and only It can make their hearts calm like the tea in this cup.\n​​\nThe two elders sat opposite each other, and in front of them was an unfinished chess game. I think, here, for them, they may not only taste the tea in their hands, but also play the chess in front of them.\n​​\nIn addition to drinking tea, I often hear: \"Life is a dream, and tears are a thousand lines.\" then. Someone else said: \"I've been wandering all my life, and it's almost sunset. I feel homesick and heartbroken. I dare to ask where is the road?\" Yes, where is the road? What do teahouses and tea mean to tea drinkers?\n​​\nPerhaps, for urban youth, the teahouse is their post station;\n​​\nPerhaps, for the weather-beaten old people, tea is the precipitation of their years!\n​​\nSometimes people who mix tea come to mix tea, look at the cup of tea that is getting full, and finally can't hold it, it overflows, I understand it, I finally understand, it turns out that the cup is only so big, and it can only hold so much. , it will only overflow for a long time, and the cup of tea in your hand will gradually fade and become dull.

Don't hesitate when it's time to let go, but people think that the overflow is superfluous, but it's not, that's called giving up.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WKYveFbiyMDKZzYjfVIWW.png?height=270&width=378)\n\n\n​​\nThose who know how to give up are those who truly know how to cherish!\n​​\nIn fact, from the first time a tea drinker tastes tea, it is not only the tea in their hands, but also the long-lasting tea in life.

Maybe NFTs for your cars so you can sell your car using only NFTs, and not going to government for selling your cars. \n\nEvery day smart assets are being introduced to world using Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Houses are now smart, cars are smart, phones are smart, watches are smart, etc. These smart houses can do many things, like providing homeowners security, comfort, convenience and energy efficiency by allowing them to control smart devices, often by a smart home app on their smartphone or other networked device. Smart cars can do many things like “Communicating” Systems for Cars, System of 3D Gestures, Car Integration with Smartwatch, System for Automated Parking, Integration with different Apps, Full Integration with Phones. \n\nMost important point of them all is “owning”. Owning an asset like a phone or a house has many different aspects. In our “centralised” world owning an asset is having the rights by the government. Government gives you the rights to sell, rent, or even destroy your asset. But in the decentralised world, government is not there to give you rights. Rights of sell, rent, and destroy or other things in the decentralised world is given to you by owning that asset. Owning in this world means differently from the centralised world. Owning an asset is having the asset in your wallet address. \n\nIn the world of decentralisation, a virtual asset is an NFT that you own in your wallet. But what if you want to own your house or car as an NFT? ERC 721 or ERC 1155 that are described in [this article](https://mirror.xyz/0x2d209040c031d4e2D4d9cb4D3aabf18F52260AB0/YLdBJP9rIqzVc2vYH4LTC5rUwSdAst96F5IN8QhpWIw) cannot fulfil this action. They can not tie to real assets in the world. So another Ethereum standard is needed to tie NFTs to real assets. \n\nThis standard is the [ERC 4519](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4519) standard, or as the call it “SmartNFT”. A SmartNFT is tied to a physical asset that can check if the tie is authentic or not. The SmartNFT can include an Ethereum address of the physical asset and, consequently, the physical asset can sign messages or transactions. The physical asset can operate with an operating mode that is defined by its SmartNFT with an attribute named state. The token state can define if the token owner or the token user can use the asset or not. A cryptographically secure mutual authentication process can be carried out between the physical asset and its owner or its user. SmartNFTs extend [ERC 721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) non-fungible tokens, which only allow representing assets by a unique identifier, but not by an Ethereum address. Moreover, SmartNFTs extend ERC 721 NFTs to include users in addition to owners.\n\nThis SmartNFT was developed because the ERC 721 NFT does not include the users of an asset (only include the owners) and does not include the Ethereum address of the asset. Smart assets (for example, IoT devices) are increasing nowadays. If smart assets are tied to SmartNFTs then they can be managed in a secure and traceable way. The reason is that SmartNFTs, unlike ERC 721 NFTs, allow establishing secure communication channels between the physical asset and its owner and its user. In this way, assets, owners and users can be assured of exchanging information with trusted parties.", "timestamp": 1658297779, "digest": "sutycC5npJRj0uCjEjPdxK5SQ_vBzng3eAAMNKhMLqs", "contributor": "0x2d209040c031d4e2D4d9cb4D3aabf18F52260AB0"}

VC）、潜水观察员（@connectfarm1）、匿名博士（Chris_Defi）、Jimmy（@CryptosLaowai）、大君（加密分析师）。这是0x499旗下 DeTalks 栏目第 24 期，主持人是 Linda Jiang（MEXC Global Listing Manager）。**\n\n**Linda Jiang（MEXC Global Listing Manager）**\n\n大家好，我是 Linda ，主要在 MEXC 负责 Global Listing 的工作，欢迎大家来到今天由 0x499 举办的 Twitter Space。我们知道比特币已经在 20000 美金横盘很久，后续会是一个什么样的行情走向，今天邀请几位嘉宾来共同参与讨论，首先请他们来进行以下自我介绍。\n\n**Bill（Co-founder of DeCentralized VC）**\n\n大家好，我是从 2020 年中期开始 DeFi 的第一批玩家，目前主要是做一些分析研究工作，寻找好的投资标的。很高兴今天有机会跟大家交流，一个是如何在熊市中生存下来，另外是如何在下一波牛市来临的时候获得最大回报。\n\n**大君（加密分析师）**\n\n大家好，我也是 0x499 的老朋友了，目前是一个加密分析师，之前是每天在微信视频做直播，给大家分析行情和一级二级市场，现在是每周四做一次，平时输出主要在 Twitter 和 视频号。\n\n**潜水观察员（@connectfarm1）**\n\n大家好，我是一个种子投资基金的联合创始人，也是 Avatar DAO 的联创之一，我们主要关注一级市场项目，我个人的喜好是 NFT，是一些项目的早期参与者。\n\n**Linda Jiang（MEXC Global Listing Manager）**\n\n我们看到 BTC 已经在 20000 美金附近横盘很久了，作为加密市场的风向标，BTC 仍然占据整个加密货币市值的 40% 以上，大家都很关心接下来的行情走向，各位嘉宾怎么看？\n\n**Bill（Co-founder of DeCentralized VC）**\n\n对于 BTC 的价格行情走势来说，我觉得如果你是长期价值投资者，可能不是太重要，你可以采取定投或者越低越买的策略来进行操作。比特币的走势首先是受整个大经济环境的影响，第二是目前加密货币行情走势很低，BTC 在美股里面算一支大型股票，同时又完全没有监管，我觉得是很容易被人操控的。对于这样的资产，无论你是去套用周期理论还是技术分析，都会产生有的时候对、有的时候不对的结果，到最后发现无论如何都很难去解释。在这种情况下我们去预测一周、两周甚至一个月的走势是很难的，但是从减半节点、经济带宽等相对长远的指标来分析的话，相对来说会更加准确一点。\n\n我用的分析方法都是采信至少三年以上的。因此短期来说很难判断，长期来说比如 2024 年减半会是一个比较好的话题，通常是牛市信号比较明确的时间点。作为长期价值投资者，你应该把握住减半前半年的时间点入场，做好自己的策略去执行投资行为。\n\n**潜水观察员（@connectfarm1）**\n\n虽然我个人基本不碰二级市场，但是通过观察二级市场，能够给一级市场很多指导。我记得当时在 6 月 26 号的时候，我们认为七八月份会有一波行情，研判的依据也比较简单，就是情绪和人心，情绪是投资者对市场上所有信息的终极反应，当时推特上有些人就已经低落到聊生死大事了，这个情况下肯定是个低谷，如果你问这一轮熊有没有到位，我觉得还没有，如果大家都觉得熊市结束、牛市要回来的时候，我会非常果断地去做一个波段。\n\n我们自己是长期持有 BNB 和 ETH，这不在我们操作仓位里面。我觉得之后的行情还是受大环境影响很明显的，像美股和美国经济、中国房地产、印度外汇，全球各个国家有各自的问题。如果这一轮金融去杠杆没有完完全全地到位，这种情况我认为不会迎来一个根本性转变，我们依然要去观察传统金融市场的走向，比如美国还没有大型银行发生倒闭挤兑，那这一轮危机可能就没结束，中国仅仅是二三线城市房地产暴跌、一线城市还在涨，再加上疫情的影响，大环境依然很动荡，我觉得最多到年底，不管是以太坊 2.0 是否落地，这一轮反弹都将告一段落，接下来随着整体市场的恶化，会导致进入一个新的混乱期，这是我的判断。\n\n**大君（加密分析师）**\n\n我从合约和期权两个角度分析一下接下来的行情，仅供大家参考。\n\n这两天 ETH 上涨了 40%，原因是 The Merge 在 7 月 14 号的一个利好，还有就是 1.3k-1.5k 期权的购买，整个操盘手是在 FTX，顺带拉爆了其他交易所的合约。我前两天也是发了一个推特，预测 ETH 这一波上涨在 1.3-1.5 附近，昨天是够到了 1.6k，但是没有到 1.7k，实际上技术指标是 1.7 附近。\n\n比特币跟以太坊不一样，受整体大行情影响，它是一个非常成熟的投资标的，最近的利好来自欧债危机，最近欧元指数和美元指数差不多持平了，美元一直在看涨，最近出现了回调，各大股指上涨，特别是美股指数和期货黄金指数，这跟比特币基本上是相对的调整方向。\n\n所以以太坊是由市场行情推动上涨的，比特币是由整体大行情上涨出现了回调。所以这两个是不同阶段涨的，而且涨的逻辑也不一样。接下来的走势我认为还是维持一个熊市的整体局面。上次我来 0x499 参加活动预测的回调价格是 18k，因为这是大旷工舍弃“挖、提、卖”的一个价格。最近的话我觉得可以关注一下 22-25 这个点，但还是提醒大家要注意止损，因为目前整体依然是熊市。\n\n**Linda Jiang（MEXC Global Listing Manager）**\n\n这一波熊市中，ETH回撤力度也非常大，基本上跌去了三分之二。应该来说发展这么多年， ETH 已经是和 BTC 完全不同的应用和估值逻辑，但是 ETH 的价格和一众 ERC20 Token 还是受 BTC 波动的影响很大，你认为未来有可能改变吗？\n\n**匿名博士（Chris_Defi）**\n\n我们看到比特币的市占率在下降。过去如果行情走到深熊的话，一般比特币的市占率是往上走的，虽然这一轮熊市多了很多新的玩法，无论是 DeFi、GameFi 还是公链，但是我依然觉得单一地去看比特币市占率的剧本已经过去了，可能未来我们要看比特币市占率和以太坊市占率的结合，最近的行情都在围绕 2.0 在讲故事，这是以太坊本身内部的叙事。\n\n在这一轮回调之前，其实整个加密货币的行情一直是跟着标普 500 走的，基本上美股现货价格都是由期权推动，现在期权在 3900 多，下方的 3700 有一个非常强的防守位。所以美股也是在一个区间内围绕着一个价格做无规律波动，从周线级别来看，美股最近还没有完全走出来，整个 8 月是处于事件空窗期，9 月可能会有一些大事件。只要美股没有大的下跌动作，或者在某个区间去徘徊的话，加密货币可能就会有一个像样的反弹，我个人倾向于下周会有一个回调，8 月份可能还会继续开启一个反弹。\n\n**Jimmy（@CryptosLaowai）**\n\n我是在中国生活的混血，在北京长大，2016 年大四开始炒币，也是经历过一轮超级大牛市和恶心的熊市这么一个完整的周期。我是一名交易员和分析师，一般都是炒现货，熊市会抄一些期货，但是期货只做空，如果看涨的话会分批买入现货的操作方式。预测对我来说是一个工具，比如说看到在上涨或者下跌 20% 的时候会有很多人暴涨，那我会在那个价格点附近开单，这时候流动性就非常好。另外刚刚 Bill 说的情绪面我觉得也是非常重要的，我主要是看 Twitter 和 Telegram 大群，这里面散户的情绪是非常重要的，一般行情是跟情绪反着走的，这是熊市逻辑，牛市是大家都赚钱，因为大饼是越摊越大。但是熊市主要是场内资金在相互博弈，所以我的思路是跟主流作对，但是这个也分时候。\n\n长期来看，我认为目前是熊市初期，马上要不如熊市中期。初期大家都不认为是熊市，认为是正常回调，反正没有跌破去年 519 的底部，现在还是牛市，在 3w 以上，3.3w-4.8w 那一波震荡，大部分人还是看牛市的。后来我观测的情绪是跌破 2.8w 以后，基本上所有人都默认我们在熊市中，这个没有错。但是当大家都这样转变过来思路的时候，这是熊市中间会出现的“牛陷阱”，在大家觉得牛市就要来了的时候，就是开一个低倍空的时候。\n\n目前这个位置，尤其是前两周，散户的情绪是集体看空，都认为大环境极差，加密圈就是美股，所以你炒币的还看什么 BTC，就看标普 500。但是明显上周出现一些变化，以太坊 2.0 的合并叙事出现了，两三周前我们也说过这件事情，大部分人那个时候觉得 7 月份还是不好的，但是我说可以观测 LDO 这个币，因为它是目前以太 2.0 最大的质押代币，如果这个币技术指标上进入日线级别下跌通道，如果跌破这个通道，肯定就是以太 2.0 叙事开始，所以我在 0.6 的位置特别关注以太坊的动作，果然汇率起来了，差不多是昨天和前天都在找这一波上涨的理由，这就是 2.0 叙事出现了。\n\n我的观点一直没变，七八月份是第一波涨，以太在 2200-2400 之间，9 月合并很有可能会推迟导致回调，这时候大概率会有一个极具看空的情绪，这个其实很好理解，过去六个月从 4800 跌到 880，好不容易有一个利好回弹，结果发现被骗了，这时候可能会跌到四五百，之后再开始反弹，就有一个牛市看涨的情绪了。这个画在图上就是一个 ABC 的三浪调整，我觉得这是一个非常好的工具。\n\n另外我是不看美股指标的，但是我知道这些时间和数据的时间点，但这是一个滞后的指标，反应的是已经发生的数据，一般这些数据放出来，价格会有一个明显波动。对加密圈来说，这主要是一个催化行情的作用，而不会改变行情的方向。\n\n我认为以太和大饼的关系已经发生一个脱钩，这是一个非常好的事情。大饼是没有故事讲的，唯一的就是 ETF，没有升级空间，算是加密圈最稳定的资产。但是以太是有各种各样的发展和用例，我相信在做很多人都没有比特币钱包，有的都是一些老韭菜，以太的用户特别多，网络效应特别强，以太出现独立叙事是标志着币圈在美股之前反弹了，但是大饼比较滞后，大饼没有涨，所以其他的也不会涨，这是一些人唯一看空的理由。\n\n所以 ETH 反弹我认为预示着后半年会有一个比较好的行情，走一个简单的预测，我认为大饼 11 月份会有一个 48000-53000 之间，明年再跌到八九千；ETH 涨到大概 3000-3600 之间，明年会跌到 390，这个跌幅有点大，但是我觉得币圈远远没有跌够，在场还赚钱的人太多了，基本上要回撤 90%，这个熊市才会结束。\n\n所以总体而言我是看好今年，不看好明年，然后 2024-2025 大周期会起来。另外减半不减半对于比特币的价格我认为影响很小，因为币圈是 24 小时交易，不像股市每天只交易几个小时，币牛熊转换周期会很快，熊市大概都是 16-28 个月，跟减半没关系，只是刚好对上。\n\n**大君（加密分析师）**\n\n我并不认为以太会跟大饼脱钩，底层还是以 BTC 作为一个头，因为它毕竟是加密圈底层共识。那这次以太反弹，很多人就会问后续到底是怎么走，看涨还是看跌。首先以太的话，我个人肯定是看好的，今年出来的新项目资金势力都不错，包括 Layer2 的 OP 啊等等，只要以太挺住了，这些代币的价格都不多。另外 ETC 是跟 The Merge 相关的，还有 APE，包括刚刚提到的 LDO，大家都可以去多观察，后续牛市的时候有可能成为新星。但是像之前 Luna 崩盘，我觉得还是跟 BTC 有很大关系。\n\n**Bill（Co-founder of DeCentralized VC）**\n\n对于以太坊，不管是 Layer0、Layer1 或者 Layer2 的前景，我们可能要反过来看。每一波牛市的开启都有它不一样的叙事方式，比如说上一轮的 ICO、这一轮的 Defi，如果下一轮大牛市在两年之后，那个时候叙事方式是从哪个领域出来，这个是很重要的。\n\n根据这个预测，我们可以反推一下有哪些东西还是欠缺的，尤其是在基础公链方面。我们作为散户很多时候是欠缺的，我们可以更加多地以来大 VC 的分析判断，他们经过了 N 多个牛熊的人，创始人是最早一批成功的人，同时扶持了大量的早期项目，所以我相信他们的感觉是比较准的。如果担心只依赖一个 VC 的眼光可能会出错，那可以看多个 VC 有没有共同押宝的赛道。\n\n目前现在大的 VC 都在投 web3。现在 web3 的雏形项目有一些欠缺的东西，第一个是钱包入口的易用性方面，第二个是很多项目在说的公链吞吐量并发量，第三个钱包安全也是非常头疼的问题，这是像 A16Z 等 VC 希望从这些方面能够在未来有所突破。\n\n至于说现在看到的比特币和以太，他们是两种不一样的资产类型，比特是共识堆积起来的价值存储方式，把它类比于黄金是现阶段比较好理解的；以太更多是生态建设催化剂的角色。这两者发展上脱钩是完全有可能的，目前币圈整个 TVL 还很小，如何能够真正吸引大资金进来，假设外汇交易市场有个 20%-50% 用区块链的方式去交易，成本更低效率更高，未来的数字货币市场就完全不一样了，体量是现在的 N 倍。到那种情况下，以太坊作为出圈的价值，潜力会更加大。\n\n**0x499**\n\n在 2021 年的牛市中，很多挑战以太坊的新公链获得了惊人的市值增长，个别公链比如 Solana 依靠链游的成功塑造了高性能的差异化定位，同时近期基于以太坊 Layer2 的项目代币热度很高，是否说明对于公链而言，高 TPS 和高可拓展性依然是支撑估值的关键？\n\n**潜水观察员（@connectfarm1）**\n\n我个人觉得 Layer2 现在是一个打问号的赛道。我没想明白为什么以太坊要转 2.0，更没想明白未来这么多公链有什么用。甚至不以成败论英雄的话，我觉得 ICP 和 Filecoin 提出的东西会更加 make sense 一点。所以终究这是一个情绪和预期主导的世界。比如大家之前说以太坊 2.0 是一个利空，这两天又是一个利好，过段时间又是一个利空。任何一个公链和底层技术都是随机性的，我们今天使用的互联网之前，在它之前可能由另一套协议表现更好，但是人类历史发展是由很多随机性组成的，我在想是不是以太坊当年出来的时候，在世界的另一个角落有一套智能合约技术和框架比以太坊优秀，只是恰好终于跑起来了。\n\n我觉得最重要的一点，是你的生态中究竟能吸引多少人口，如果你从这点来判断，甚至中国的联盟链都有机会。像前两天王老吉这种消费类巨头直接发 NFT，我们看到各种传统势力和巨头不断进来这个行业，最终胜出的未必是现在的以太坊，甚至未必是出自币圈。所以在我看来币圈长线命题不太成立。\n\n我们在思考 web3.0 投资的时候，会更多去想激励层而不是去中心化。比如说 DAO 有多大几率在未来会代替公司，而不是思考一个事情底层能去中心化成为一个什么东西。\n\n**Jimmy（@CryptosLaowai）**\n\n我觉得关键是公链的经济模型，比如 Solana 手续费非常低，但是需要通过无限制增发或者通货膨胀的方式 SOL 代币去给维护网络的节点，如果没有足够多的人去接盘的话，就很难维持价格坚挺。所以我觉得公链更多是 VC 的产物，它不是一个币圈原生的东西。\n\n下一个牛市肯定有 Layer1 故事可讲，在以太坊没有实现分片技术之前，以太坊是 VC 大面积踏空的一个项目，另外那些拿了 VC 钱的项目可能涨了一两轮就涨不动了，但是以太坊可以一直涨下去。这个可能也跟我自己的偏见有关，我在 17 年的时候投了 NEO，后来几乎归零。\n\n我非常同意 Bill 的观点，可以去看 VC 在做什么，我在上一轮牛市中买的币都是听一个 VC 朋友说的，所以大家看到团队特别好的项目可以在不怎么了解的时候，可以放很小的资金去买一点，然后设定一个一到两年的退出周期。\n\n相比于 Layer1，我更看好 Layer2，因为 Layer2 要比 Layer1 容易构建，尤其是 Optimisitic Layer2，比如某一个游戏完全可以把 OP 分叉一个，受益于以太坊的网络效应和安全性，所以 Layer2 会吸引特别多的资金过去。\n\n**0x499**\n\n其他一些板块，比如 NFT、GameFi、元宇宙概念的代币，在熊市结束之前有没有一些结构性投资机会？\n\n**Bill（Co-founder of DeCentralized VC）**\n\n熊市是最好的投资和建设时机，如果你在牛市或者牛市中后期再去投资，通常都会是一个韭菜。以这种投资理念来说，熊市是一个好机会。首先在熊市的时候，有些二级的价格要低于一级的价格，所以你作为一个散户，可以去割 VC 的韭菜，从这个方面来说无论是 NFT、GameFi 还是元宇宙，都可以在深熊的时候可以找到很好的标的。\n\n另外 NFT 项目和 NFT 平台是要区分来看的。图片的话在我看来觉得大多数都是归零的，每天 Opensea 上出来的项目太多了，压中的概率是非常小的，除非你真的把握住背后的团队和文化，一般散户在这方面是蛮难的。所以对 NFT 市场更加建议关注基础建设和工具类产品，熊市是一个最佳时机。比如说 GameFi 里面使用 NFT 的数量是最大的，比如说 Flow 承载了 100 个 NFT 项目，即便是大部分都死掉了，只有一两个跑出来，Flow 依然可以吃到项目增长的红利。\n\n第二个是可以找新的机会，做一级市场，我是传统投资做一级市场出来的，以前传统做一级失败的概率是很高的，但利润优势最丰厚的，如果你看准项目和团队，所以在熊市里面我不会放弃去找优质团队和项目的机会。一级的判断是相当难的，直接去做对方向、人的把握是挑战非常大的，我用的衡量标准就是找这些创业团队的发起人，要求至少在圈里面 4 年以上的连续创业者，选择的方向至少要符合下一个赛道有最大流量增长的那个，那我们就可以去搏一把，同时也要做好评估，不要把鸡蛋放在一个篮子里面，熊市的好处是估值比较低，一般你可以找市场影响力的 VC 一起投，每个 VC  的成本不会很高。\n\n熊市很长的时候，我们可以慢慢看，不像牛市的时候要在 24 小时内定下来，抢不到就没了。目前我手里面也有很多这样的团队，如果有些项目越到熊市越起劲，那你就要多给些关注的。所以这是二级和一级两种方法并用起来，在熊市中找投资机会的方法。\n\n**大君（加密分析师）**\n\n我认为 GameFi 还是有非常大的机会，去年 VC 大概一共往 GameFi 赛道投了 40 亿，现在是 100 亿。我最近也在做一个 GameFi 的 IGO，可以看到整个游戏页面和画质都比之前有很大增长，这些项目的一级打新还是有一定机会的。\n\n另外 NFT 我研究了一些巨鲸，他们基本上人手 3000 多个甚至 1w 个都有，现在玩法还是以土狗为先，大户是能够拿出一些现金流来玩 NFT 的，比如说 30 个 ETH，最后拿到 150-180 ETH，这种情况是存在的。但是 NFT 玩家基本都是长期 holder，基本都是 46 天以上，因为 NFT 流动性是要挂单拍卖。\n\n其他我看到行业里面一些赚钱机会，一个是元宇宙，即便是在熊市里面也是能够发光发热。当然也有一些别的，比如说空投的 OP 等等。所以熊市里面也会有很多一级的机会，该赚钱的还是会赚钱，但肯定是要大浪淘沙，一定要沉下心来看。\n\n\n---\n\n```\n                                 END

In fact, life is only a process, come naked, go naked, everyone is the same, just go to the world naked to experience life. The results of all efforts belong only to each station in the life process. It's just that we are all working hard and paying to be as fruitful as possible on the road of life. We set goal after goal and then run toward it, eager to get results, to be successful. Including academic qualifications, diplomas, including money, status, including love, marriage, and social recognition. But not every effort will be rewarded, not every effort can be treated fairly, not every persistence will get what you want, and not every sincerity can be accepted. As a result, some people are in pain, some people are sad, and some people even give up on themselves. Life is ups and downs, if you care about the success or failure of each life site, life will inevitably be tangled and pessimistic. People are often attracted and even shocked by the glory of successful people, but often ignore the failures they have experienced and the bloodstains they once had. The success of a certain life site of the successful person is actually the accumulation of the process. Success does not come from chance, but the necessity of experience. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rK5N_ezZUjz8QUMxuuSUo.png?height=270&width=357)\n\nA long life, some hard work, just the harvesting process. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard to put his own money into his first business, a program called \"Traf-O-Data,\" which ended in failure. Churchill didn't go to school when he was in sixth grade. Every office he held was a failure. They are well-known and famous, and there have been some efforts without seeing results, but they have become the biggest successes in people's hearts. Don't worry too much about working hard, and don't care too much about the results of your efforts. Correct attitude, the most important thing in life is not a certain result, but the process of life. Just like in a play, knowing that every play will eventually end, the actors in the play still perform very hard. After the performance, whether there is applause or not, the curtain must be drawn. Only the performance is the most important. As long as you work hard and try your best, you will not regret it, and even if you fail, you will not regret it. What you have experienced is part of your life, and it is the accumulation of your future life. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rqyX1uUZQP1-b1cSPIhcq.png?height=266&width=418)\n\nWhether this process is exciting, meaningful and valuable depends entirely on one's own attitude and understanding. I saw a piece of news earlier, Lisa and Alex, the adventurous British couple traveled to 50 countries, changed into local clothes in each country, re-made the bride and groom again, and photographed a fusion of different The photos of the customs and wedding customs allow each country to witness their union and love, and a total of 52 marriages have been married. The hardships they pay are more meaningful in the process and in their own hearts. Give life a happy process, a fulfilling process, more than anything else. Even if you can't dominate the objective environment or change the reality, you must at least learn to dominate your own mind. No matter what the result of your efforts, you can smile and reap the process of your own efforts.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SkDJ5fYGXwCJSTx-IquXx.png?height=270&width=291)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658298186, "digest": "_EWSvOU5HaonsCv1xGVWCL4wdT0pYkN412SY8gnxcxg", "contributor": "0x31d8F6f61478eD1c50C1264fe85F7f35D4D6049d"}

The first two are easy to decide, and the latter two are more difficult.\n​​\nMany units have a fixed half-day business study every week, which is very meaningful and necessary, and is of great benefit to improving skills and enhancing quality. However, because the form is simple and the content is boring, it has become a very boring thing in some units. People try to escape the meeting, or the left ear enters the right ear and the effect is greatly reduced.\n​​\nTeenagers especially like to play video games, because the form is lively, the content is rich, the pictures are beautiful, and it is very interesting to play. Some children are almost obsessed, forgetting to eat and sleep, day and night, skipping school and skipping school. But this kind of very interesting thing is really meaningless. Indulging in it can only be a waste of life and wasted time.\n​​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jKoTLmsba9Q2KTTadHm4X.png?height=270&width=396)\n\n\nA happy person is doing something meaningful and interesting. Marx has been doing meaningful and interesting things all his life, forgetting to eat and sleep. Engels' ambition was also to study theories, but in order to make a living, and most importantly, to finance the lives of Marx's family, he had to engage in \"boring\" business until he entered old age and his life with Marx was guaranteed to a certain extent. He was finally able to devote himself to theoretical research that was both meaningful and interesting in his own eyes, and co-founded the theory of the proletariat with Marx.\n​​\nThe cartoonist Fang Cheng, who is 96 years old this year, was asked the secret of longevity, and the answer was: \"I do things I like and meaningful every day.\" Smart people are good at turning meaningful things into interesting things, and turning boring things into interesting things. Boring things become interesting things. This requires being eclectic, daring to innovate, advancing with the times, and boldly reforming. Learning from Lei Feng is a very meaningful activity, which can cultivate a noble personality and lead the social atmosphere. However, due to the outdated and rigid forms of activities in some places, which are not suitable for the interests and temperaments of young people, this very meaningful thing has become a boring thing. The most exaggerated thing is that on March 5, nearly a dozen students from a nursing home came to learn from Lei Feng, and some elderly people had their feet washed several times a day. In fact, with a lot of brains, learning Lei Feng's activities can be very lively and interesting. For example, making cartoons about Lei Feng's deeds, designing game software that learns from Lei Feng, and composing popular songs about learning from Lei Feng, etc.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0z5hqUFhyzBXvMBwdji5v.png?height=266&width=457)\n\n\n​​\nA philosophical person can adjust himself in time, adjust his interests, adjust his emotions, and turn the originally meaningless things into interesting things. Generally speaking, the meaning of things is objective and will not change, while the meaning of things is subjective and can be cultivated. Shen Congwen originally wrote novels, which was both meaningful and interesting in his mind. However, later on, the situation changed and he had to change his career to study ancient costumes. Although this was a very meaningful thing, it was very uninteresting to him. He got into a new job with the unyielding stubbornness of Hunan people, calmed down, calmed down, and slowly fell in love with clothing research, and eventually became a famous ancient clothing research expert.\n​​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3Ai01-yo-yuhVMJpUBOJ1.png?height=270&width=397)\n\n\nLife is often faced with choices. If we can choose to do something meaningful and interesting, it is a great blessing in life, and we will never tire of it. If the conditions do not allow it, then you might as well learn from Shen Congwen, do one line of love, one line of excellence, and one line of excellence, so as to turn meaningful and \"uninteresting\" things into \"interesting\" things, and then become famous and make life worthwhile. As for those things that are \"interesting but meaningless\", such as playing video games, as long as you are not addicted to them, you can play them, but you must do so in moderation, so as not to lose your mind and waste your time in \"interesting\" play. I feel like I've lived a \"meaningless\" life.", "timestamp": 1658298392, "digest": "KDMnVMKjCnvdhncu8NeL6Qya_qxq1-gVd2Pldps4Mco", "contributor": "0x31d8F6f61478eD1c50C1264fe85F7f35D4D6049d"}

链上隐私产品的成功上线都有着重要意义。** \n **\n\n主要进展包括：\n\n1. 产品进展 — Dolphin 测试网发布及持续更新, 为波卡生态带来隐私链上隐私转账；\n2. 品牌意识及增长 — 团队越来越多亮相国际会议和活动，社区参与度持续增加；\n3. 团队扩张及融资 — 为实现 Web3愿景持续招募全球优秀人才；\n\n# \n\n# 一、产品进展\n\n* **v1版本 Dolphin 测试网**\n\n自去年12月份 v1版本 Dolphin 测试网上线以来，隐私转账突破6万笔，独立钱包地址达6000个。我们同时收到了约500份反馈，用户对测试网产品给出了4.5分的平均分（总分为5）。\n\n* **v2版本 Dolphin 测试网**\n\n用户对于 v1版本测试网的反馈对于我们持续的产品开发至关重要。2022年5月，我们发布了 v2版本测试网。v2版本让用户可以更加快速、安全地体验隐私支付；同时我们还增加可可重复使用隐私地址，更合规的功能以及更加优化的用户界面。\n\n![Dolphin Testnet V2](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I71w7zljxmkQT22KW7UAO.png?height=787&width=1400)\n\nv2测试网发布仅仅一个月，隐私转账就超过了15万笔，Manta Signer 下载次数超过2万。团队发布的新版 manta signer 及 dolphin dApp 让零知识证明生成速度大大提升，新账户创建的同步时间也减少了一半。 \n \n\n* **Calamari XCM**\n\n \n \n\n2022年上半年，波卡完成了最备受期待的里程碑之一：发布了“跨共识”消息格式 XCM，成为一个完全具有可操作性的多链生态系统。\n\n这让波卡平行链资产的隐私化更进了一步。4月份，我们在测试网上与 Moonbeam 测试网成功完成了 XCM 部署。之后，我们又持续完成了 Calamari 与 Karura Network、Moonriver 间的 XCM 整合，并提出了与 Khala Network 开通双向 HRMP 通道的提案。同时团队也正与更多平行链团队进行合作，敬请期待。\n\n \n \n\n* Calamari Collator 节点计划\n\n团队同时持续进行多方面的开发，其中有一半的核心工程师团队聚焦测试网，另外一半工程师致力于通过 Calamari 社区 Collator 节点计划将社区进一步去中心化。Calamari 社区 Collator 节点计划的目的是维护网络的安全性和去中心化程度。在第一季度，我们的节点计划有10位 collator，第二季度末，collator 数量已经达到了20位。我们计划在三季度再增加15位 collator，如果你也对我们的节点计划感兴趣，可以访问<https://docs.manta.network/docs/collator/CommunityCollatorProgram> 了解更多。\n\n \n \n\n* OpenZL\n\n** \n **\n\n最后，在零知识证明的开发方面，[团队发起了开源零知识证明（ZK）库

3级)。每个用户有四个神秘盒插槽。神秘盒子有10种品质。一旦收到一个神秘的盒子，倒计时就会自动开始。当倒计时结束时，用户需要花费少量的$GST(“基本成本”)来打开它。倒计时时间随着神秘盒子的质量而增加。\n\n### 运动鞋质量\n\n球鞋有五种品质(普通、不寻常、稀有、史诗和传奇)。当Sneaker被铸造时，每个属性的值是由Sneaker的质量决定的最小值和最大值之间随机选择的。因此，即使是相同质量的运动鞋，其属性水平也可能存在显著差异。用户需要燃烧$GMT来升级他们的运动鞋，当达到一定的里程碑。\n\n### ‍鞋铸造\n\n在一个造鞋活动(SME)中，用户使用他们拥有的两双运动鞋作为蓝图来“繁殖”，创建了一个鞋盒。作为参考，这两款运动鞋将被称为vintage(父母)。\n\n为了开始一个SME，两个年份必须在用户拥有(不是租赁)和完全耐用。用户可以选择一个Sneaker来“繁殖”通过访问薄荷标签，选择Sneaker，并按薄荷。这两款酒都有72小时的冷却时间，尽管在此期间它们仍然可以用于移动。在这里了解铸造成本。\n\n![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61fdc688c14c2d02be89c30e/62d05fcd8779f33e6f53a1ec_ZfCRW3SZYeCgfc2577Q1rAHRSM-1Mx9XHqhZvanKyITpOZXfAHe4Gm-Ddo8E-nuSlXSva0zpOCFEJmrURjlbQaM687d256eKlxLhpDmvA3KP16HpiHbdJhzgECu28QHgAwLloUu22TBqFzOid6k.png)\n\n## 游戏模式\n\n### 单人模式\n\n玩家在Solo模式中通过穿NFT运动鞋获得代币。需要能源才能获得$GST。只有在用户获得NFT运动鞋后才能补充能量:1能量等于5分钟的“移动到赚取”活动。\n\n### 马拉松模式(开发中)\n\n“马拉松模式”要求用户提前24小时在“马拉松”选项卡下注册。马拉松将以每周和每月为单位举行。在这里了解更多关于每周马拉松和每月马拉松的信息。\n\n## 市场低迷影响STEPN\n\n \n 由于治理型代币和实用型代币都从今年早些时候的历史高点下跌了80%到98%，因此，STEPN代币的价格已经随着普遍的熊市下跌。在4月份的峰值，GMT和GST分别为4.19美元和9.36美元。自那以来，这两个代币一直呈下降趋势，形势似乎很严峻。\n\n![gst价格图表](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61fdc688c14c2d02be89c30e/62d05fcdbfcdbe4dab5e7765_xevUYf6_w1tdTrVwiyK5l_hj8GL4G4prhTXJ6oxRbR9IIy_zKD8fPRUDLIoLWHUrBYAug-RqmLemfheQR4MjoQan-V9JmJuzVX6zjtybiyX373f4NE36SGhAKvv8CGyBRy1KeBdVrpxJWdGTLrI.png)\n\n![gmt价格图表](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61fdc688c14c2d02be89c30e/62d05fcd8ced6e76677a4aa5_Mfg3fQKbEhjlgU3EOxmY9GUzDXvu83nodAK7Lm93kP1H2NepeeP33dF_F8alQ0oPHT60_vIKIpZNW5oAT1ELXXknUBsdU09SlmfIlSiSmO7Tm7Ml3QQlje9QEQ5VzDxX3i7SqoRLtWfkZKea1MI.png)\n\n一些社区成员将代币的大幅下跌归因于STEPN应用程序在中国被禁。\n\n>   “自从中国禁止了这款游戏后，它就变成了一场屠杀，价格大幅下降，以至于对于小跑步/步行者来说，出去散步几乎没有回报。”一位sten用户和BSC新闻的密切联系人说。“索拉纳和消费税的价格下降了，鞋子变得非常便宜(我的鞋子损失很大)。” \n 在sten最受欢迎的时候，用户可以通过在Solo模式中在附近慢跑赚到数百美元。玩家可以以最高9.36美元的价格获得3-4美元GST的NFT每日奖励，即使是使用最基本的Sneaker。目前，同样的步法在4月份可以为用户赚到40美元，但收益只有约0.82美元。\n\n此前，Solana NFTs的成本约为600美元，获得积极的ROI大约需要16天。但截至7月14日，最便宜的Sneaker售价约为69.88美元。按照目前的价格，投资者需要大约145天的时间才能实现收支平衡，每天的回报率为0.70美元。因此，悲观情绪在一些社区成员中蔓延。\n\n> “有些人还在玩游戏……我是说，离禁令还有一个月。如果我在中国，我会很舒服地玩游戏，然后等到7月10日扔掉球鞋离开。”STEPN Discord的一名社区成员说。 \n ‍\n\n## 积极的促进\n\n \n 尽管加密货币市场状况在过去几个月有所下降，但该公司在一篇Medium帖子中表示，该公司第二季度的利润为1.225亿美元。\n\n![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61fdc688c14c2d02be89c30e/62d05fcdc1b73a81b3f58f07_vEzZAXj1gwGlcXFpQkP6DLvKQzHjdX_PhxU8AMhSLpLoO063GuZX3IUWtIghQU0dLMErhn9GiGOENRdFud8GdSPk33gTo2ZzbT_mxz9O7o4mJQudRLWIjrGnb0pJIiO3QYxpEwwfUTa3fZwbm58.png)\n\nM2E协议计划利用其5%的利润来启动GMT代币回购和销毁计划。然而，为了防止价格突然波动，回购和烧钱的过程“可能需要几周时间才能完成”。\n\n此外，开发人员表示，除了回购和烧钱计划外，STEPN将分配资本储备来改进现有功能和构建团队。尽管《京都议定书》面临挑战，但许多人仍保持乐观。\n\n> “如果STEPN团队完成了他们的产品，并开始一场大型的营销活动，情况仍有可能再次好转。步行或跑步的赚钱部分吸引了许多人，他们只是还没有意识到，或者还不习惯使用加密钱包，”接近BSC新闻的一名STEPN成员说。“为了让STEPN成功，我认为他们需要针对没有加密领域经验的人进行大规模的营销活动，我认为他们应该为不知道私钥的人提供托管钱包等。”\n\n \n 据《STEPN》报道，该公司已经确定了几个投资收益的领域，以便改进游戏玩法。其中包括安全增强，防止机器人获得GMT的反作弊机制，建立开发者和核心团队，以及确保赞助和伙伴关系。\n\n> “我投入了很多。我现在不担心回报，因为我专注于长期投资。现在，我正在增加我的双链持股，增加我的主要鞋，并为第三领域做好准备，”一位社区成员说道。\n\n \n 继SOL领域和BNB领域的成功之后，STEPN打算在以太坊上引入APE领域。\n\n> STEPN团队将这个领域描述为“拥抱时尚和其他非主流社区的一个伟大实验”。 \n APE领域将为所有STEPN用户提供一个创新的新领域的访问，专注于可访问性并带来新用户。\n\n![stepn路线图](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61fdc688c14c2d02be89c30e/62d05fce7b062ca03fb45c4f_g6TynMYWGd7rPkml_ZurruO12nfQEaIIqBmID1JSxeFRWgvAwEQ613Od7XpWysfMgOFqBlfYVXYB3EWldZst6XAS3z5BAeRwNSQXQa7or5GxHK4MgptxkJmnZAe_I8cmCWQISkzDbuN_3KMWkuI.png)\n\n## 部分想法\n\n由于行业低迷，再加上中国数据法律禁止存储公民的GPS数据，STEPN不得不屏蔽中国用户。此外，sten的平台自推出以来一直受到一系列分布式拒绝服务(DDoS)攻击，导致用户被警告在维护期间“锻炼可能无法正确记录”。\n\n然而，如果STEPN克服这些障碍，加密货币市场可能会看到移动赚钱成为一个蓬勃发展的行业。此外，如果它的经济激励能促使一些人离开沙发，开始行动起来，那是一件好事。\n\n![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/61fdc688c14c2d02be89c30e/62d05fcd1094f2f5b8f4c15e_7Spv0lY4jSSP2PNdzoyjEfz39swMjvAega2X4nwRYx6R8jY8XS8gRaGej0NFrXfNMSiKvER_8p5ubPWBPPVTOxF8watKMliEarlaONJie8pgIem4iEe0U3JehZsvewhEeU0dhSeJHsouf1A8tyY.png)\n\nSTEPN社区在社交媒体上非常活跃，仅在Twitter上就有64万多粉丝。许多用户在NFT市场创造了高流动性，使升级后的运动鞋更容易销售。最后但并非最不重要的是，即将到来的租赁升级和以太坊上的Ape Realm应该会增加用户基础，增加所有代币的价值。\n\n‍\n\n## 什么是STEPN:\n\n \n STEPN是一个Web3应用程序，结合了GameFi和SocialFi元素，允许用户移动和赚取(移动和赚取)。玩家可以通过散步、慢跑或户外跑步来获得游戏内的代币。STEPN在2代币、GST和GMT(治理代币，有限供应)的机制下运行。", "timestamp": 1658298191, "digest": "l8kk9wRXvADuNC51E0HgWREtgfKoHMDN5EvJ5wVcE_k", "contributor": "0xA55e93fD3CCe2cf40D43824B2f18889F404dDf57"}

链上隐私产品的成功上线都有着重要意义。** \n **\n\n主要进展包括：\n\n1. 产品进展 — Dolphin 测试网发布及持续更新, 为波卡生态带来隐私链上隐私转账；\n2. 品牌意识及增长 — 团队越来越多亮相国际会议和活动，社区参与度持续增加；\n3. 团队扩张及融资 — 为实现 Web3愿景持续招募全球优秀人才；\n\n# \n\n# 一、产品进展\n\n* **v1版本 Dolphin 测试网**\n\n自去年12月份 v1版本 Dolphin 测试网上线以来，隐私转账突破6万笔，独立钱包地址达6000个。我们同时收到了约500份反馈，用户对测试网产品给出了4.5分的平均分（总分为5）。\n\n* **v2版本 Dolphin 测试网**\n\n用户对于 v1版本测试网的反馈对于我们持续的产品开发至关重要。2022年5月，我们发布了 v2版本测试网。v2版本让用户可以更加快速、安全地体验隐私支付；同时我们还增加可可重复使用隐私地址，更合规的功能以及更加优化的用户界面。\n\n![Dolphin Testnet V2](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I71w7zljxmkQT22KW7UAO.png?height=787&width=1400)\n\nv2测试网发布仅仅一个月，隐私转账就超过了15万笔，Manta Signer 下载次数超过2万。团队发布的新版 manta signer 及 dolphin dApp 让零知识证明生成速度大大提升，新账户创建的同步时间也减少了一半。 \n \n\n* **Calamari XCM**\n\n \n \n\n2022年上半年，波卡完成了最备受期待的里程碑之一：发布了“跨共识”消息格式 XCM，成为一个完全具有可操作性的多链生态系统。\n\n这让波卡平行链资产的隐私化更进了一步。4月份，我们在测试网上与 Moonbeam 测试网成功完成了 XCM 部署。之后，我们又持续完成了 Calamari 与 Karura Network、Moonriver 间的 XCM 整合，并提出了与 Khala Network 开通双向 HRMP 通道的提案。同时团队也正与更多平行链团队进行合作，敬请期待。\n\n \n \n\n* Calamari Collator 节点计划\n\n团队同时持续进行多方面的开发，其中有一半的核心工程师团队聚焦测试网，另外一半工程师致力于通过 Calamari 社区 Collator 节点计划将社区进一步去中心化。Calamari 社区 Collator 节点计划的目的是维护网络的安全性和去中心化程度。在第一季度，我们的节点计划有10位 collator，第二季度末，collator 数量已经达到了20位。我们计划在三季度再增加15位 collator，如果你也对我们的节点计划感兴趣，可以访问<https://docs.manta.network/docs/collator/CommunityCollatorProgram> 了解更多。\n\n \n \n\n* OpenZL\n\n** \n **\n\n最后，在零知识证明的开发方面，[团队发起了开源零知识证明（ZK）库 OpenZL 倡议](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkxMDAwMjM2Nw==&mid=2247484475&idx=1&sn=7ae4cd875944c4b36ebffcf1cc030205&chksm=c13355ebf644dcfd402e02714be30829a18b4c4ef5a205acbc1160c3d7d77fd976dad7652497&scene=21#wechat_redirect)。这个开源库项目将帮助没有密码学背景的开发者也可以便捷地在应用中构建零知识证明，更多关于OpenZL的信息请访问 <https://github.com/OpenZkLib/openzl/blob/main/proposal.md>\n\n \n \n\n* 体验 v2版本 Dolphin 测试网(附带激励计划)\n\n我们邀请您体验 v2版本的测试网，同时通过表格给我们提供反馈还有机会获得激励。对于 v1版本测试网，我们没有提供激励计划，因为 v1版本的目标是为了从社区尽可能多地收集反馈。在收到的500多份反馈中，大部分都在 v2版本中得到了采纳。\n\n我们希望通过 v2 版本Dolphin 测试网来触达到更广泛的社区，从更多的新用户那里获得反馈，并向那些从未听说过 Manta 或 Calamari 的朋友展示波卡/Kusama 生态的隐私支付。\n\nv2

Uncomfortable to solve. In fact, why bother about which came first, the chicken or the egg? As long as you understand, there is no self-reliant woman who walks the red carpet all the way to the other side of success, and there is no successful woman who does not use a smile as a sharp blade to overcome difficulties, and use optimism as an oar to overcome thousands of sails.

A sprout as big as half a grain of rice sprouted on the branches of the tree; after the wind and rain, after the tree folded and flew, I was delighted at the flexible expression of the grass to the world; after the earthquake of the landslide, I was delighted at the sound of the distant ruins.

{"id": "Y6Y-yKV26FDWSRQGxe_QlIKzm6PIHlZOvCfZfrEBs88", "title": "Tiny Bytes: Mechanical Ents", "body": "Hello,\n\nToday, I want to take a break from how encryption will break and jump into some world building. One of the ideas that initially got me gong was how could Ents exist but be created by technology. Here’s the idea:\n\n## Background\n\nRedwoods in California start to die. No one knows why but their bark starts falling off and they become structurally unsound. Eventually the bark that falls off is replaced with artificial bark. \n\nInitially, the replacement bark just mimics the original bark. It has a rigid structure, gets placed on a tree, and bark grows over it (either by the tree or biological science). Over time the replacement bark gets mode advanced. Sensors are added to monitor the tree’s health and the area around them. Bluetooth/other is used to help the trees communicate locally (or mixed with natures natural ability to communicate). Some trees have the ability to spray liquids to help stop forest fires.\n\n As we get more data on the trees we begin to understand them more. Analyzing that data and combining it with NLP allows use to see the trees’ thoughts. We learn to talk back to the trees. The bark can send signals to the trees. Also, at this point, most of nature is some combination of tree/bacteria (currently exist) and devices with AI/introduced support organisms (future introductions). Communicating we have subtle ways to communicate with each -- i.e., communicate with the tree. This allows a type of two way conversation with trees. \n\nWith conversation comes novelty. Some trees are given a set of mechanical eyes and a mouth. Some are a novelty and others are for convenience (the trees can also communicate with personal electronics). Of course, different areas debate different rules about communicating with trees. \n\nDifferent implementations, policies, changes of human movements, and different amounts of care lead to different outcomes for trees. Some tree’s artificial bark no longer looks like bark but just metal. Some have movement and can sway to the light. Some have the ability to move by their roots to make relocating trees easier. \n\n## Imagined Conversation\n\nHi Tree, how are you?\n\nThe soil is dry and it has not rained. I am thirsty. The whole valley is like this. Is that why you are here?\n\nNo, I am here to see the views.\n\nThe views are quite pretty. I hope they last.  \n      There is trash near my roots. Could you please pick it up?\n\n(not sure what tree personalities are yet) \n\n## Ecosystem\n\n(This will take much more work)\n\nDifferent trees will take different amounts of human involvement to survive. However, as time goes on the ecosystem needs to support these trees. There has to be bacteria/organisms that help recycle the parts on the trees. They last a while but there needs to be something. There also has to be a way that the artificial bark lasts for many, many years.\n\nI also imagine that the tree seeds eventually are supported by some kind of technology. The seeds can be fragile and helping the seed grow + get sensors is important.\n\nThat’s the quick idea for now. I also thought about if I wanted to live in this world. If technology touches everything is that a good world? I’m not sure. I DO want there to be systems that exist without human help (fully automated).

After school every day, he stayed in the small garden in the backyard, observing the flowers and plants. Reddude had a strong interest in drawing since he was a child, so he started to draw all kinds of roses.\n​​\nWhen the classmates saw Reddude's painting, they laughed at him and said, \"Do you want to be a painter just by painting a few flowers?\"\n​​\nReddude was hit hard. In the small garden, the more he thought about it, the more sad he became, and he couldn't help crying.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ql8r-ZgZPnYRElxWQWT2g.png?height=270&width=390)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/disr4vE2F5xlMlYgZIBhH.png?height=273&width=330)\n\n\n​​\nHis father walked behind him and asked softly, \"Dear Redud, what's the matter with you?\" Hearing what he said, his father laughed: \"Yes, you really don't know much, but what does it matter? What? Who knows better than you about roses? You don't need to know everything, everyone has familiar territory.\"\n​​\nReddude suddenly became enlightened. Yes, who knows roses better than himself? I can even draw the different forms of roses in a day. This is my strength!\n​​\nAfter that, Redoud regained his self-confidence and began to observe and depict various plants with great concentration. Later, he became a famous French court painter, famous for his exquisite watercolor paintings of flowers, especially roses and lilies. His \"Atlas of Roses\" recorded the appearance of 170 kinds of roses.

But it is true that playing can be divided into those who can play and those who do not, and the difference between the two is still very large.\n​​\nA graduate of the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University named Huang Hui, recently wrote an article \"\"Old Partner\" Liang Sicheng\" to recall the student life in those years, as well as the kind \"old partner\" Liang Sicheng's bit by bit of teaching and advice to him. influences.\n​​\nWhen talking about learning and playing, the author recalled that in the final exam of the sophomore year, more than half of the students in the class failed in material mechanics.\n​​\nThis is really embarrassing, and everyone starts to summarize the reasons and lessons. After some people wanted to understand, they reported to the teacher that the author at that time often gathered seven or eight classmates to ride into the city to watch performances and football games, and did not go to self-study at night, which had a very bad influence.\n​​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PBezftw1v1Dze8PJQ4_1D.png?height=266&width=430)\n\n\nThe teacher was a little angry. He found Huang Hui, who took the lead in playing crazy, and severely criticized him. But he was very unconvinced. For a while, he thought how could he have such great ability to influence more than half of his classmates. For a while, is it a deadly enemy to play and learn? A nerd who doesn't know how to play is useless in the future, no matter how good the exam is. Thinking of this, he talked back to the teacher.\n​​\nAt this time, the head of the department, Mr. Liang Sicheng, summoned the author. He was anxiously waiting for a possibly extremely severe criticism, and he did not want to make things worse.\n​​\nWhen Mr. Liang criticized Huang Hui, he really had a serious face and severely criticized him for not following the discipline. The author liked and respected Mr. Liang at the time, and silently accepted the teacher's instruction, and was about to leave when the other party stopped him again, and said to him with a smile:\n​​\n\"Just now, Liang Sicheng, the head of the Department of Architecture, was talking to you, and you must implement my opinion; here is the little old man Liang Sicheng and you discussing the issue of 'playing', you can listen to it or not. In fact, 'playing' is a good thing, learning architecture People who play more and have more knowledge, but they must be able to play, not foolishly.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vRMi3--Da-PwTRF8dYVpq.png?height=266&width=435)\n\n\n​​\nThis remark was greatly beyond the author's expectations. Mr. Liang actually affirmed \"playing\", which means that it is not wrong to take seven or eight classmates out to play, but the teacher thinks that they can't play. Isn't playing \"stupid\"? Are you happy and relaxed? If it's a serious thing to play, what's the energy and meaning of it?\n​​\nOf course, the teacher saw the doubt in his eyes, and then told him about his experiences in sports and literature and art when he was young. Those experiences were really wonderful, not inferior to theirs. The author secretly admired it, and listened more relaxedly and attentively. Finally, Mr. Liang Sicheng told Huang Hui:\n​​\n\"When people in sports teams design a stadium track, they don't ignore the slope of the track and the buffer lane after sprints; when people in choirs design a concert hall, they don't ignore the sound quality of the back seats. Their design concept It is different from the depth of people who have no interest in style. But if you just play stupidly, if you don’t read it, or don’t want to, then it’s called play for nothing. When you play, you have to consider your surroundings, look around, think about how you would deal with this design if you did it ? To play, not to be a nerd.\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uN_PGoPMow1z1DHXwTMv4.png?height=266&width=417)\n\n\n​​\nMr. Liang's lively and simple words and deeds completely convinced the author. It turns out that foolish play is nothing to play, which is really a big loss. The teacher does not want nerds who can't play and can only chew on books, because the future design of nerds will definitely be Those who don't \"know people\", or that kind of nerds just design for the books they have read and themselves, not for others, and even bring about the consequences of laboring the people and hurting the money, and then the loss will be even worse. There are heaven and earth in the game, and there are hidden dangers in the game. \"Little old man\" and \"old friend\" Mr. Liang's far-reaching intentions turned out to be here, and how sincere he speaks, it is moving and admirable.\n​​\nHuang Hui said affectionately in the article: \"When I think about it now, every bit by bit during the six years of getting along has affected my life principles and habits of doing things, and unknowingly paved the way for our dedication.\"", "timestamp": 1658299927, "digest": "GTGYhxIT0tcmPyQ6EdplEbaNJaCUoJswBgYusaM1zwg", "contributor": "0x20A82d328EEC024bE271ba5acD502939B3ee6394"}

{"id": "yAMyxVJUeX2WQhUbSrfmK9cjGWxTjOsg_mZy90gEPqE", "title": "A fireside chat with Re7 Capital & PWN", "body": "### In our latest Twitter Spaces session, we joined forces with Evgeny of Re7 Capital. Join us as we look back on a great fireside chat that spanned a range of topics, from Evgeny’s experience using PWN to the best security practices in DeFi and the future of NFTs.\n\n### Introduction\n\nSteve and [Evgeny](https://twitter.com/evgeny_re7) first met about a year ago, when Evgeny reached out to Steve after both took part in a call together with some folks from [MetaCartel](https://twitter.com/Meta_Cartel). They’ve stayed in touch since then, and just recently, our team has been in touch with Evgeny about a [super exciting Nouns NFT loan](https://twitter.com/pwndao/status/1547854897478963200?s=20&t=Av67GzoUdR5v21bQt1x1Sg) worth $60K that’s currently backed on the PWN platform. Through this process, Evgeny had a chance to get up and personal with our platform.\n\n### What does Re7 Capital think of the PWN platform?\n\nEvgeny was one of the first people to use the recently released version of the [PWN protocol and platform](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/). So what was his experience like while using it?\n\n* **Great UX and UI**: Evgeny mentioned that using PWN is smooth and the process is super straightforward. He’s a fan of our clean UI (and enjoys our simple yet aesthetically pleasing color palette)!\n* **Verification made easy**: Using PWN, it’s easy to cross-check assets on OpenSea. This is because we include an asset explorer link (such as Opensea) directly on a loan’s detail page. [Visit PWN](https://pwn.xyz/) to learn more.\n\n### All about the Nouns deal\n\n[Our first Nouns NFT loan](https://twitter.com/pwndao/status/1547854897478963200?s=20&t=Av67GzoUdR5v21bQt1x1Sg) is a big deal.\n\nWe’re extra excited about it, since there are only 374 Nouns in existence with a floor price of 108 ETH (roughly $115,560) per NFT. Around 10,000 Nouns are estimated to be around in the late 2040s, so there’s currently less potential sell pressure and buyers are closely involved through proposals and the nounification of the NFT landscape.\n\nThe Nouns community is one of the most active communities out there, and they actively manage their treasury. What makes this community really stand out is how well-structured it is as well as the fact that the team is composed of real DeFi professionals.\n\nNouns’ average price has been going up over the last \\~120 days, with an average 90-day price of 96 ETH and a 90-day volume of 2,807 ETH. Nouns DAO has implemented some best practices of other blue-chip PFP projects – they’re CC0 and they have been innovating with funding mechanisms.\n\nWhen using the platform, PWN users don’t need to worry about owning an NFT worth 100 ETH. Since PWN is deployed on Polygon, network fees won’t be a problem for NFTs with a smaller value. [Check out the PWN platform for yourself](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/)!\n\n### Steve’s questions for Re7\n\nA large segment of our fireside chat with [Re7](https://twitter.com/Re7Capital) was spent discussing some hot topics in a Q&A session. We’ll sum up some of the questions that Steve had for Evgeny.\n\n**How do you check that you’re interacting with the right contract?**\n\nRe7 carries out dozens of on-chain transactions every day and has been doing so for a year. In the team’s day-to-day activities, maintaining security is a top priority. ”It’s really easy to lose money on the blockchain if you’re not careful”, said Evgeny. “It’s really important to double check everything you’re doing.”\n\nEvgeny emphasized the ongoing need to keep one’s security in check while mentioning a few notable industry vulnerabilities, such as the exploits affecting [Convex](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/24/convex-finance-sets-up-new-urls-after-website-address-is-hijacked/), [Harmony](https://decrypt.co/104138/north-korean-attackers-behind-100m-harmony-hack-report), and [Solana’s Wormhole](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/03/solanas-sol-tumbles-10-after-326m-wormhole-exploit/).\n\nA couple pieces of advice to stay on top of one’s security are as follows: Always be sure to [verify contract addresses on Etherscan](https://info.etherscan.com/how-to-verify-address-ownership/#:\\~:text=Step%201%3A%20Upon%20clicking%20on,able%20to%20sign%20the%20message.) and check that any collateral is really what you think it is.\n\n**Do you proactively revoke approvals that you think you won’t be using in the future?**\n\nThe Re7 team finds it the most efficient to carry out periodic reviews. “The reality is that if you’re doing this all the time, it can become painful,” said Evgeny. In order to bolster security, they also make use of many different wallets — that way, if someone gets unlucky, they’re able to contain the damage.\n\n**Do you get a lot of scammy content in your DMs?**\n\nRe7 receives *a lot* of scammy messages on their channels. As a rule of thumb, the only people who they respond to and communicate with are those who they actively know. Otherwise, they choose to block other DMs, around five to seven of which they receive daily on Twitter.\n\nEvgeny’s advice: If you get a message from someone you don’t know asking for information and/or help, it’s best to assume it’s a scam until proven otherwise\n\n**How does Re7 Capital evaluate risks when investing? Has the playbook changed in any way now that we’re in a bear market?**\n\nEvgeny pointed out the importance of distinguishing between real risk and the perception of risk. He compared dealings within DeFi with the oft-cited quote, “If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.” He commented that there’s a similar result in DeFi; in other words, “If you don’t know where the yield is coming from, you’re the yield.”\n\nIn regards to the current state of the market, Re7 sees how the perception of risk has affected how people manage their money. Because liquidity has dried up, the playbook has changed and is currently evolving at a rapid pace.\n\n### Thoughts on DAOs\n\nAs the conversation turned to the topic of DAOs, Evgeny went over a few key facts about Re7’s organizational structure: Re7 has its own investment fund, and Evgeny is a part of MetaCartel. The company is fully regulated and compliant in what they do, which ultimately protects them as a business. Re7 decided against moving to a DAO, but in general, they feel that certain organizational structures are relevant for a company’s respective use case.\n\nAccording to Evgeny, investment teams can either choose to be very open or opt for efficiency over openness. His team’s experience has demonstrated that communication in a more closed environment allows for making decisions instantly.\n\n### Final reflections\n\nTwo things that Evgeny is excited about looking ahead are NFTs and the metaverse. He was curious how the PWN team envisions the future of NFTs.\n\nAs Steve put it, “We need to see a proper marriage between NFTs and the DeFi ecosystem”. He recently dove into the importance of this topic during a talk on how to onboard a billion DeFi users (more on that in [our recent monthly digest](https://pwn.mirror.xyz/I6TjFg0MVUZx542XnKzsZDs1P4UzrOtrRk86a4i6lYQ)).\n\nIn the next six months, PWN will be able to do things with NFTs that web2 has never even dreamed of — so stay tuned! For now, [check out the platform](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/) to:\n\n* See how much others are willing to lend\n* Check out the loans available at the moment\n* See other NFT collections that are currently listed\n* …and more!\n\n[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PWNFinance) to stay as up to date as possible on our team’s daily activities.\n\n\n---\n\n**A massive thank you to Evgeny and Re7 Capital for teaming up with us for this session.

This way, creators can **convert their social capital into financial capital**, and get direct support from their fans instead of relying on external social platforms. We do this using the power of **social tokens**.\n\n## What Are Social Tokens?\n\nSimply put, tokens represent **ownership** or **access rights** to something. In the case of social tokens, they’re backed by the reputation of an individual, a brand, or a community.\n\nUsing social tokens, **fans and communities** can become **part-owners** of a creator’s brand (for a deeper dive on how this works, check out our article [What Are Social Tokens?](https://mirror.xyz/0xF1650d925DFfC086aC720ca976DD01542A7f528d/Fz6uyY_VTECWTlKMyxGFcECNwN-ks3cDW7wXoW972a4)).\n\nSocial tokens have many **benefits for creators**, including:\n\n* They **don't depend** on third-party rules, which gives you more **control** over your content, community, and your relationship with fans.\n* Fans can buy, sell or trade your token, which lets your most hardcore fans **participate** in your success.\n* They **foster** an engaged community with aligned interests (because everyone has a stake in your token).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dB_H-SFJyOos9BXPSV5x2.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## Why Choose Mintted?\n\n### Easy for fans & creators\n\nTo help as many creators as possible, we built a social coin platform that’s **easy to use and understand**. When you join Mintted, your fans will be able to support you by buying your social coin with **credit cards**.\n\n### The Power of Fan Tiers\n\nUsing our **Fan Tier System**, you can set the access level your fans will have to your community based on their **level of engagement** (amount of coins purchased). The more coins fans have, the more benefits they receive in the form of special perks, exclusive content, etc. You as the creator also get to decide what these benefits are: In-person meetings? One-on-one Zoom calls? Group coaching? Access to courses or trainings? **The possibilities are endless**!\n\n### Creating Real Value\n\nYour social coin will have **real value** inside your community. This is a huge upgrade compared to social media, where your content is often only rewarded with free likes and follows. Fans can **hold** your coin to preserve their fan tier status, or they can **purchase** more to unlock certain benefits. Fans can also **redeem** coins for special utilities (coming soon) or sell them for their current market value to other fans.\n\n### Get the Highest Payout in the Creator Economy\n\nAs a creator on Mintted, you’ll **keep 80% of the coin sales** + a **fee** from every **transaction**. Plus, there are no upfront costs or hidden add-on charges to tokenize your community on Mintted. Getting started is **free**.\n\n### Great for Fans, Too\n\nMintted is equally great for your fans. They’ll be able to easily support you and get exclusive access to special perks and benefits that are exclusive to community members, and not available on other platforms. It’s as simple as **purchasing your social coin** using their credit card. On Mintted, everybody wins.\n\nTo see how other creators are using these unique features and tokenizing their community, check out our beta app [here](https://mintt.me/mintted_app).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dgMD2ZwOAbiopM-jCCDgV.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n## Tokenize Your Community\n\n**Mintted exists for you**. To help you turn your influence and social capital into financial value. To help you liberate yourself from social media regulations, brand dependency, algorithm anxiety, and monetization struggles.\n\nMintted is where **true creative freedom begins**. Build a closer relationship with your fans by turning them into valued partners.

長尾去哪了？\n\n> 作者：Ted Gioia\n\n![Source: Original Content 來源：原始文章\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zeXTDKZ0OJ0cdTI5U4Qei.jpeg?height=512&width=900)\n\n第一次聽到別人預測[長尾](https://www.startechup.com/blog/long-tail/)的崛起，我覺得被逗樂了。不僅僅是因為看起來完全引導至錯誤的方向，還因為它和我身邊發生的事物完全方向相反。\n\n提到這個我這很痛苦——因為「長尾」理論是以經濟定律為人所知，一個預測未來將更包容、繁榮，且能幫助到獨具創意的人們的定律。根據理論支持方的說法，長尾會藉由擴展藝文的廣度，且給擁有遠見、但還在邊緣的人們一個推動力，讓文化恢復生氣。\n\n另類聲音將會被滋養、蓬勃。音樂會變得更酷、更令人驚艷。書會更多元且有趣，獨立電影將能接觸到更多的觀眾。等等等。\n\n嘿，這有什麼不好？\n\n但這從未發生。更準確的說，它永遠不會發生，因為這整個故事就只是童話而已。我以前就知道是這樣，因為我很多次被雇用來分析長尾經濟，但是這些推理上的瑕疵到今天要明顯得多，甚至對我來說也是如此。\n\n然而，很多人相信過——也有很多人仍然相信，因此值得深入挖掘長尾的故事，驗證究竟為何它永遠不會達到。\n\n或許我們還會透過了解它為何失靈，找到其他抵達失落的文化復興的可能路線。\n\n\n***\n\n> ### 根據理論支持方的說法，長尾會藉由擴展藝文的廣度，且給擁有遠見、但還在邊緣的人們一個推動力，讓文化恢復生氣。\n\n\n***\n\n對於尚不了解「長尾」這個名詞的人，它指的是一個專注在幾乎沒有客群產品或服務的生意。最基本的想法是，你可以賣給這些極小的消費者群體來賺很多的錢——因為這種群體沒有獲得足夠的服務，還有，雖然每一個群體只有一小點成員，如果你吸引了很多這樣的群體，加起來它就會變成一個很有意義的機會。\n\n舉例來說，一個書店需要在以下兩種策略中二選一——(1) 只賣幾乎大家都會讀的暢銷書籍，或 (2) 在書架上放成千上萬不流行的書，所以即便擁有特殊品味的顧客也可以找到他想要看的書。\n\n根據長尾理論觀點，在網絡時代下，聰明的書商會把所有不賣座的書保留在庫存中——因為暢銷書一旦開始走下坡，那麼地下的小眾利基市場就是未來的走向。\n\n這個想法在 2006 年 Chris Anderson 的書 The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More 得到廣泛的普及。Anderson 期待一個更多企業都像 Amazon 未來，有大倉庫可以放所有的東西：[從培根形狀的 OK 蹦](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=bacon+bandages)，到[青少年的手機監獄。](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cellphone+jail)\n\n畢竟，Amazon 如此成功——為什麼大家不使用這個策略呢？\n\n即使只是輕輕一瞥，這個方法也感覺很怪。如果你知道 Amazon 的歷史，你大概會記得，它的現金流多年來都很糟糕——甚至很多人預期它會破產。即使是現在，[Amazon 所有的運營收入都是來自雲端和網絡服務業務](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/aws-earnings-q1-2022.html)。如果只靠零售業務，Amazon 是一個炸彈。\n\n![Source: Original Content 來源：原始文章 / 權威人士一直以來質疑 Amazon 基礎零售模型的獲利能力](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vkVpUDpexVNIieUm_mgpB.webp?height=1200&width=920)\n\n另外一個長尾理論的經典分析案例是 Netflix。在 2006 年 Anderson 新書上市的時候，這是正確的，Netflix 確實為訂閱者製作了非常多的電影。\n\n但那些日子已經過去了。\n\nNetflix 不僅僅是大量減少它平台上供應的電影量，現在它還有一堆競爭者（Disney、Apple、Paramount 等等）也在嚴格管理它們的品項。\n\n![Source: https://www.pcmag.com/news/as-netflix-originals-increase-overall-content-is-reduced](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I3AanNrpA82r4xiK_DDsb.webp?height=715&width=1272)\n\n好萊塢的製作公司，比上述的串流平台更著迷於「短尾」。回到 2006 年，Anderson 預測了暢銷大片的末日——但這之後發生了什麼？\n\n這個表格顯示出原創內容在電影產業不斷遞減的角色。主要的製作公司寧願去追尋更可預測的霸榜作品，也不願在新的、別樣的內容上冒險一搏。\n\n他們還是想要「短尾」——且逐年遞增。\n\n![Source: Reddit with source data coming from BoxOfficeMojo\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9auhw2Aprox3anMxNnR_2.webp?height=646&width=1272)\n\n這是新冠前的數字，但是疫情及越發謹慎的觀眾，讓製作公司更執著於萬無一失的暢銷大片。如果你懷疑，看一下這個 [2022/2023 預定上映好萊塢預算最多的電影](https://www.thefilmik.com/upcoming-big-budget-hollywood-movies-2022/)名單，名單上沒有任何一個原創電影概念。\n\n1. 阿凡達 2（2022）\n2. 巴斯光年（2022）\n3. 灰影人（2022）\n4. 黑豹 2：Waianae Forever（2022）\n5. 雷神索爾：愛與雷霆（2022）\n6. 黑亞當（2023）\n7. 沙贊！2（2023）\n8. 閃電俠（2023）\n\n最後一個仍在頑強抵抗的長尾是音樂串流平台，比如 Spotify。他們沒有縮緊平台上提供的音樂——嗯，還沒。但是[音樂串流的現金流表現不佳](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/spotify-shares-now-selling-at-less)，如果這些平台也開始限縮提供的音樂，我也不會很驚訝。Spotify 已經開始嘗試讓音樂廠牌進行[付費推廣](https://www.inputmag.com/culture/spotify-wants-artists-labels-to-pay-them)，如果哪天他們開始收根本不會有什麼點擊率的上架歌曲費用，似乎也不會太詫異。\n\n我顯然不是唯一預期這將要發生的人——幾天前，一個領先的音樂行業趨勢獨立分析師，也[提出了同樣的擔憂](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2022/06/10/spotify-charging-artists/)。\n\n![Source:

來源：原始文章](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o-5EaXaUQkYQEOQ9eAljU.webp?height=267&width=1272)\n\n然而，即使在現在的制度下，短尾也統領了音樂。如果你是一個音樂家，如果你只做小眾音樂，[幾乎沒有辦法可以賺到一個中產生活](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/the-disappearing-middle-class-musician)。我們目前還有音樂家在這樣嘗試，但是他們並沒有成為反文化的某種重要代表，他們只是成為主流文化下被落下遺忘的靈魂，且逐漸凋零。\n\n結果就是，暢銷大片並沒有死去。電影裡沒有，書籍裡沒有，音樂裡沒有。相反的事情發生了，反而是反文化被壓縮、被邊緣化。\n\n還有一個最終極的諷刺，看看 The Long Tail 這本書的封面與封底，出版者第一個宣佈的事情就是，這本書是一個「暢銷書」（BESTSELLER）！如果他們真的相信暢銷大片已死，小眾是未來，他們理應提出完全不同的主張——類似這樣：來買這本大家都不敢讀的書。那才是一個蓬勃發展的地下文化要跟主流大眾說的話。\n\n但即便是這本長尾書幕後的人們，都想要存活在這條分布曲線的短尾上。\n\n![Source: Original Content 來源：原始文章 / 書裡宣稱暢銷書籍是一個壞賭注——封面跟封底除外\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fhq9EtWx4MRUiw2Q5PXM-.webp?height=702&width=1272)\n\n我並不是說 Anderson 歡慶的這些「地下邊緣小眾」都已經消失殆盡——我只是在說，他們在現代，比起歷史上任一時間點，能帶來的文化影響都還要小。要以小眾存活，幾乎就像是披了哈利波特故事裡面的隱形斗篷一樣。\n\n我現在可以清楚看到這些了。但我 2006 年最初對長尾的懷疑是始於其他因素。很久以前，我只是一個剛剛畢業的 MBA 學生，我的第一個專案跟解決一個長尾問題有關。\n\n那是一個複雜到難以置信的問題，且需要分析哪個顧客購買了這個企業的主要產品。你可能以為企業早就知道這個，但他們真的不知道。一個快餐連鎖品牌大概知道一年會賣出多少個漢堡，但是幾乎不能明確指出，誰吃了華堡（Whoppers）。即使是現在，我們有了這麼多追蹤 cookies，這仍然是一個非常難回答的問題，在當時，幾乎是不可能回答。\n\n因此，公司雇用了我這樣的人來尋找答案。\n\n分析迫使我要在各種市場調查中遊走，最終我創造了一個超級巨大的試算表。我說的是一種極其龐大、鯨魚尺寸的表格——大到幾乎讓我當時的電腦當機。\n\n我真的填滿了這個數位檔案中的所有表格——用盡了最後一個格子！我打賭你根本不知道有這種可能性，但確實有。之後，當我開始用這些數字做數據分析，我那強有力的 IBM 通常會停滯 5 到 10 分鐘，只為一個很簡單的運算。\n\n一個在這個專案上的朋友說，「我們必須要折磨這些數據，讓它說話。」這就是我們做的事情，最終，數據確實說話了。\n\n我了解到，大多數的購買只由很小數量的客戶完成。沒有這些關鍵用戶，這個生意早就臨近死期——這不是開玩笑的。這些重度用戶比任何我們想像中用戶，還要重要的多。\n\n他們稱之為 80/20 法則，而我的分析一次又一次驗證了這個法則。看客戶層面，我發現 20% 的客戶負責了 80% 的營收。看產品層面，我發現同樣的分布：80% 的銷售來自於 20% 的產品。\n\n我想我不應該感到驚訝——畢竟這是一個經濟學中很常見的法則。不過即便如此，能夠一次又一次在專案、後續的研究中證明這個法則，還是很有趣。\n\n我現在知道這是一個自然事實，或者至少是人的天性。當時我還沒有研究過 [René Girard與模仿慾望理論](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgB9p2BA4fw)——我現在可以清楚的明白，他是一個真正的先知，不過是短尾的先知。從前我就已經能從試算表裡面看到，短尾是長什麼樣子了。趨勢能以自己的能量為食，對流行產品的慾望就像病毒一樣傳播。因此，前 20% 的組成個體可能會改變，但不管是誰成功進入這菁英群體部分，總是會吸引到 80% 的需求。\n\n（我有點誇大了，這個分布並不總是很精確。有時候你會看到 90/10 或 75/25 的分布關係，但這裡的關鍵在於，所有的活動都是圍繞著重度用戶與廣泛流行的產品展開。）\n\n當然，Chris Anderson 在寫他的 The Long Tail 書時，肯定知道這一切。他必定在某個時刻了解到了帕雷托原理（Pareto Principle）。事實上，他在書裡也承認了這些，但他立刻以自己的發現來應用 80/20 法則，他稱之為 98% 法則。\n\n那什麼是 98% 法則？\n\n但這裡的算數是一個笑話。一個人可能每隔幾個月就買一次奇異產品的想法，根本微不足道，並且沒有抵觸 80/20 法則。實際上它正是 80/20 法則的一部分。\n\n如果我向我聰明的客戶們提供這樣的「分析」，他們會嘲笑我、把我趕出會議室。所謂的 98% 法則，恰好精準解釋了為什麼大企業會追逐暢銷大片——因為如果他們依靠每三個月購買一次的客戶，他們很快就會變成小企業，然後最終走向停業。\n\n鑒於此，長尾是一個殘酷的笑話，是一個讓我們為被邊緣化的創作，而自我感覺良好的童話故事，「從此以後快樂生活的那天」會到來——或者我們是這樣被承諾的——因為長尾會來拯救他們。\n\n但不會。我們生活在一個短尾社會中，而且一直在變得更短。\n\n比起小眾產品，你總是可以從重度用戶、暢銷排行榜撈到更多的金，這不只是在商業上是正確的，在文化、藝術中也是。在音樂或出版行業工作的人，如果想要賺到大錢，最快的方式總是忽略這些小眾的品類。\n\n數位時代也幾乎沒有改變這個等式。就算 Amazon 沒有運營商店，它也有開銷（房租、人力等等），這跟一個書店沒什麼差別。此外，數位經銷商有更多的可變成本，這些是零售商可以避免的，最醒目的有分揀、包裝、運輸和送貨的成本。出於各種原因，他們可能仍想要提供全系列的產品，但比較是為了建立競爭壁壘，而非一種真正的價值主張。\n\n數位時代下長尾死去還有一個原因。網絡平台並沒有真的專注於服務用戶——他們真的想做的是控制用戶。這通常要求他們要壓縮利基小眾市場與另類的觀點，然後強迫盡可能多的用戶追隨牧羊人。\n\n這是一個有用的對照，網絡平台是牧羊人，如果你明白我的比喻，那麼我們全部都是羊群。\n\n我真希望我不用說這些，因為我非常喜歡這些小眾與周邊的創意。我相信他們值得我們支持，但大多數情況下，這種支持是由我們的慷慨、慈善、與對價值觀的承諾來驅動的——而不僅僅是追求利潤。因為一旦最大化利潤加入戰局，那麼分布曲線上的這些異常值，就不會成功。\n\n情況也不是全然那麼糟糕，因為確實在利基小眾市場還是有一些利潤。在每一種行業中，你必能找到一些零售商願意採取利基的策略。但是轉頭看看周圍，你會注意到，更多的企業採取 7-11 便利商店的做法，銷售大量快速消費商品，而忽略其餘商品。\n\n這些都是令人悲傷的事實，但是讓我們先把錢放在一旁。因為我想要你支持這些長尾的努力，我不會承諾你做這些會變得富裕，但是有很多好處。\n\n我們要培養這些長尾嘗試，因為：\n\n* 它們創造了一個多重、多元、多面向的社會\n* 它們提醒了我們，不是所有的財富都要以金錢來衡量\n* 它們平衡了集體思考與狹隘心態\n* 原創的突破，在進入主流前，通常是從這些周邊小眾開始\n* 比起選擇不多的社會，擁有更多選項，我們的生活會真正更令人滿足\n\n這些成果加起來，或許不會變成一個荷包很鼓的帳戶，但它們創造了一個健康的文化。因此長尾對我們確實有其作用——但它應該建立在我們的智慧與慷慨之上，而不是我們的商業計劃之上。\n\n\n***\n\n以上原文結束，[點擊這裡訂閱 Ted Gioia 原文的

So I will start with a brief introduction to our DAVA project. What we have built, how far along are we, our philosophies, and the direction we are going. \n\n### DAVA project: the Genesis\n\nSo, in the beginning, the DAVA project started as an on-chain, fully customizable avatar NFT project. Foremost, we created a protocol that enables a base NFT, DAVA humanoids, to wear other validated NFTs, one of which is the DAVA wearables collection. The protocol is fully functioning on Polygon. As a result, DAVA holders can use DAVA avatars just like in real life: you buy clothes, equip them, and express who you are, anywhere, anytime. \n\n![DAVA: on-chain, fully customizable avatar NFT project, on Polygon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CR31yh2G6J_Z-b3-Kle0v.png?height=405&width=933)\n\n### DAVA project: the Thinker of Utility\n\nUsing our outstanding technical advantages, we were constantly questioning the ''utility'' of an NFT. Some might say it's to show your social status passively, and others say membership to enter an exclusive community. I agree in most parts, but we, as project builders, felt the need to find something more exciting; Something that tingles your stomach as a crypto investor; Something that can change the world. A grand mission that we, as project builders, can devote our lives to build. \n\n### DAVA project: the Birth of DAVA Game\n\nSo long story short, we concluded that we needed an enjoyable virtual world that allows network effects to kick in. Hence, we decided to build a game protocol where validated and non-validated NFTs can permissionlessly enter and leave seamlessly. A virtual world with a working economy that functions. People would freely conduct social activities through the interface of a game and get economic rewards by adding the network value. \n\n![game protocol where validated and non-validated NFTs can permissionlessly enter](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XlOPW6Uc8v6SxcPdrkFrw.png?height=521&width=919)\n\nOur closed beta is going to launch in September. A few weeks from now, around the Korean Blockchain Week, we will release a lot of exciting information about our game. Follow us on Twitter and discord for more details. You can always hit me up on Twitter; I go by Blocksage or Jimmy. \n\n# Why it's so boring and the future of the DAVA game.\n\nI think the question drills down to one answer. It is effortless to adapt ill-designed tokenomics to P2E games. Previously, anyone would build a shitty game in a new Layer 1 chain and throw in some tokens to solve the ''cold start problem.'' But, then, BAMM; the founders, are millionaires. So regardless of the team's intentions, it was against the builder's incentive to build a thoroughly thought out, appropriate P2E game that is fun. \n\nA famous quote, \"people get the government they deserve,\" also applies to the crypto market. Likewise, web3 consumers get the builders they deserve. I genuinely believe that the tipping point for the moment when P2E games become fun is inevitable. This moment will only happen when all of you agree that a game's network value solely depends on how much ''fun'' the game provides, excluding the fun of earning.\n\nSo this in mind, our closed beta's sole purpose is to test our game's ''funness.'' Players can play our game with or without any web3 wallets. DAVA holders and non-holders will have no in-game unfairness, yet DAVA holders will financially benefit as our game increases its network value. For my gamer audiences, the game will be rouge-like with deck-building strategies. \n\n### So then, how can you build a well-designed tokenomics for P2E games?\n\nThis is a long topic, so let me elaborate in a separate blog. But our first two rules of them are following: \n\n1. Passive participants (NFT owners) should increase the value of the network by providing some utility to the active participants. Financial benefit should come depending on the value it provides. \n2. The tokens obtained by active participants should be directly related to increasing the value of the network. Simply grinding time does not apply. \n\nWith the two rules above applied to a simple game, you will strike gold just like that.\n\n### Is there any effort in marketing/ongoing development to attract more active users and increase user stickiness?\n\nOur current short-term primary mission is to build a fun blockchain game. All our development resources are used to create a sustainable blockchain game. Our marketing campaigns will kick off after the Korean blockchain week with detailed tokenomics, whitepaper, and new revamped landing pages. \n\n### Are there any partnerships you are looking for, and what kind of standard do you guys have?\n\nWe are looking for partners, advisors, and supporters who agree and empathize with our core values: games should be fun, and P2E tokenomics should value individuals who put value into the network. Ways of collaboration are almost infinite, and we are open. Feel free to contact me or the DAVA project. \n\n# Do you want to talk more about this topic?\n\nAre you interested in DAVA and what we are building? Do you feel resonance with our vision and philosophies? Check out and reach me on Twitter. I would love to hear your opinions. \n\n* Twitter:<https://twitter.com/subdev414>", "timestamp": 1658300728, "digest": "NiylqgRwebBIz9LLBzO8Y4XdGyikJ0LlBZEy8GX39WU", "contributor": "0x9a947a28e7ADB1F04248A8f091502B2BbAB4EC87"}

Whoever your heart is inclined towards, whoever you will become.\n​​\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O5xgdFNPfOYf-Ld9c1y5B.png?height=270&width=373)\n\n If we can't use our own wisdom to eliminate our own greed, arrogance and arrogance, then we will always be only weak. Sherlock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice is a man full of conquest. Because of his hatred of Antonio, he took the opportunity to lend Antonio money to enter into a \"debt-cutting flesh\" agreement with him. When Antonio was unable to pay his debts due to an accident, he made sure to cut a pound of flesh off Antonio's chest. When the duke persuaded him to be merciful, he ignored it; when Bassanio offered to pay him ten times as much, Sherlock went his own way. Sherlock's hatred overwhelmed his tolerance, and he turned his power into a murderous sword. He used his greed, hatred and arrogance to kill others when others were powerless to fight back. At that moment, Sherlock was the devil. However, at the end of the play, when Sherlock was sentenced to death and deprived of his property for attempting to kill, he knelt down and begged for mercy, just for the forgiveness of others. The real power is never to use the power in your hands to create momentum for your own selfish desires.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xf3dkL9MFu1pV-RwMnqat.png?height=270&width=252)\n\n ​​Portia famously said when persuading Sherlock: \"Forgiveness is like the rain of tenderness falling from the sky to the world, it benefits both parties - the one who gives and the one who receives it, and it is the noblest of all virtues on earth. \"In the game of hatred and tolerance, Portia, the Duke and Antonio are all angels, and it is impossible for them to have no hatred for Sherlock. However, when they defeated Sherlock with wisdom, their inner tolerance also defeated hatred, just as The Duke said: \"You are not worthy of our tolerance. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WFCg_nn7Ir5kVhR8UXqh6.png?height=270&width=394)\n\nHow can people who have no tolerance hope for the tolerance of others? But we will let you know that we have a different spirit from you.\" They let go of Sherlock, who should be beheaded , they use the tolerance in their hearts to leave a ray of life for others. ​​ What is power? Power is when we have the ability to destroy something, we choose tolerance. ​​ An Italian female explorer crossed the Taklimakan Desert alone. When she walked out of the desert, she knelt down facing the desert and was silent for a long time. A reporter asked her why she knelt after conquering the desert. She said: \"I don't think I conquered the desert, I am grateful that the desert allowed me to pass.\" Lao Tzu said: \"The one who conquers others is stronger, and the one who conquers oneself is stronger.\" Conquering others with strength only shows that you are strong and powerful, and you rely on tolerance. Those who overcome themselves with self-discipline are truly strong.", "timestamp": 1658300674, "digest": "-87YzvFXfBmHyaSIyro574VPF4g_XPG8S7C5oN7-Z-Y", "contributor": "0x20A82d328EEC024bE271ba5acD502939B3ee6394"}

{"id": "nlwlRXqUB0QwoBJueioon6egFpWVuBbjMJ3hECmqZfQ", "title": "Введение в виртуальный АММ", "body": "## Введение\n\nВ этой статье мы хотели бы познакомить вас с концепцией виртуального автоматического маркет-мейкера (vAMM), которая лежит в основе Tsunami. Будучи довольно продвинутой и недавней технологией в секторе DeFi, она явно требует некоторого объяснения.\n\nAMM - это хорошо известная концепция, пионером которой стала компания Bancor, а затем Uninswap. Это биржа, которая использует формулу x \\* y = k для алгоритмического расчета цены актива. Концепция AMM прекрасно описана в статье [swop.fi](http://swop.fi/) [здесь](https://medium.com/swop-fi/swop-fi-pricing-5f89ab8766ac).\n\nЧтобы обеспечить AMM возможностью торговли с кредитным плечом, а главное - торговать любыми активами, необходимо расширение протокола AMM, которое называется vAMM, или Virtual AMM. vAMM использует ту же формулу x \\* y = k, только в пул не предоставляется реальный актив (то есть его виртуальная часть). Вместо этого в отдельном хранилище хранится залог (USDN), который позволяет пользователям покупать виртуальные активы у пулов AMM. Таким образом, AMM используется для определения цены бессрочного контракта внутри Tsunami.\n\n## Пошаговый пример\n\nДавайте проследим весь процесс шаг за шагом.\n\n1. Когда разворачивается новый vAMM-контракт, создатель устанавливает начальную сумму виртуальной ликвидности внутри контракта, эффективно контролируя k.\n2. Например, запускается рынок USDN/WAVES. Предположим, что создается контракт с 10,000 USDN и 1,000 WAVES. Начальная рыночная цена 1 WAVES составляет 10 USDN. k = 10,000,000.\n3. Трейдер Алиса хочет открыть long c Waves с кредитным плечом 3x, используя 100 USDN в качестве залога. Она вносит 100 USDN в качестве залога в хранилище и получает 300 USDN покупательской способности на vAMM. Смарт-контракт покупает X волн. X рассчитывается по формуле: (10,000 + 300) \\* (1,000 - x) = 10,000,000. x = 29.126 WAVES.\n4. Контракт фиксирует, что Алиса имеет 29.126 WAVES, держит 100 USDN в качестве залога, и новое состояние vAMM составляет 10,300 USDN и 970.874 WAVES. Рыночная цена WAVES теперь составляет 10.60 USDN. Это ожидаемо, так как мы **покупаем** WAVES.\n5. Трейдер Боб открыл short-позицию WAVES на 200 USDN с кредитным плечом 5x. Он вносит 200 USDN в то же хранилище, что и Алиса, и получает 1000 USDN мощности для продажи на vAMM. Умный контракт продает X волн. X рассчитывается по формуле: (10,300 - 1000) \\* (970.874 + x) = 10,000,000. x = 104.395 волн.\n6. Контракт фиксирует, что Боб продал 104.395 WAVES, держит 200 USDN в качестве залога, и новое состояние vAMM составляет 9,300 USDN и 1075.269 WAVES. Рыночная цена WAVES теперь составляет 8.648 USDN. Это ожидаемо, так как мы **продаем** WAVES.\n\n> ***Вы можете заметить, что мелкие сделки сильно влияют на цену. Это вполне ожидаемо, поскольку общий объем ликвидности довольно низок (20,000 USDN). Такие низкие цифры выбраны для того, чтобы лучше проиллюстрировать принцип работы виртуального AMM. Реальные рынки должны быть запущены с гораздо более высокой ликвидностью, чтобы предотвратить такое сильное проскальзывание цены.***\n\n## Особенности vAMM\n\n### Отсутствие поставщиков ликвидности \n\nПри использовании vAMM у хранилища всегда будет достаточно залога для погашения позиции каждого трейдера. Для предотвращения недозакрытия позиций используется механизм ликвидации. Он автоматически закрывает позиции, прежде чем они обанкротятся. Это позволяет vAMM функционировать без поставщиков ликвидности (как в предыдущем примере, нам не нужна третья сторона для предоставления WAVES на vAMM). По сути, трейдеры предоставляют ликвидность друг другу.\n\n### Финансирование платежей (funding)\n\nПоскольку каждый АММ (как традиционный, так и vAMM) работает как независимый рынок, необходим механизм для приведения цены АММ в соответствие с ценой актива во внешнем мире. Традиционно в качестве такого механизма используется арбитражная торговля. Подобно другим биржам бессрочных фьючерсов, Tsunami использует дополнительный механизм, называемый **фондированием (funding)**.\n\nFunding стимулирует арбитражеров и трейдеров выравнивать цену бессрочного фьючерсного контракта с ценой актива или индекса. Funding оплачивается каждый час, по следующей формуле:\n\n![Формула Funding](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AuGU-QsVaiuKX2vb9oHF9.jpeg?height=296&width=2550)\n\nПроще говоря, финансирование работает следующим образом. Предположим, что цена vAMM > цены индекса. Это означает, что нам нужно снизить цену. Это означает, что нам нужно больше коротких позиций. Таким образом, long платят short финансирование, стимулируя арбитражеров переходить в короткие позиции, чтобы получить финансирование. Когда цена vAMM < цены индекса, все работает в обратном порядке. Таким образом, цена vAMM будет точно следовать за ценой индекса.\n\n### Торговать можно любыми активами\n\nКак объяснялось ранее, для работы vAMM не нужны поставщики ликвидности. В сочетании с финансирующим платежом (funding) биржа на базе vAMM может отслеживать цену любого актива или индекса. Теперь легко понять, как Tsunami позволит торговать некриптовалютными активами. Например, цена индекса может быть настроена на отслеживание цены флора коллекции NFT. Это позволяет трейдерам получить доступ к коллекции NFT, оставаясь при этом полностью ликвидными - без необходимости покупать NFT самостоятельно. Другой пример - торговля реальными товарами или акциями. С помощью оракула, поставляющего информацию о ценах на цепочке, на Tsunami можно торговать любым активом.\n\n## Заключение\n\nВ этой статье мы кратко познакомили читателя с тем, как работает vAMM на бирже Tsunami.

3 级）。每个用户有四个神秘盒子插槽。神秘盒子有 10 种品质。收到神秘盒子后，倒计时会自动开始。当倒计时结束时，用户会花费少量 $GST（“基本成本”）来打开它。倒计时持续时间随着神秘盒子的质量而增加。\n\n**运动鞋质量**\n\n运动鞋有五种品质（普通、罕见、稀有、史诗和传奇）。铸造运动鞋时，每个属性的值都是在运动鞋质量决定的最小值和最大值之间随机选择的。因此，即使是相同品质的 Sneaker，也可能有着明显不同的属性等级。当达到某些里程碑时，用户需要消耗 $GMT 来升级他们的运动鞋。\n\n‍**制鞋业**\n\n在造鞋活动 (SME) 期间，用户使用他们拥有的两个运动鞋作为蓝图来“繁殖”，创建一个鞋盒。作为参考，这两款 Sneaker 将被称为 Vintages（父母）。\n\n为了开始 SME，两个 Vintage 都必须由用户拥有（非租用）并且完全耐用。然后，用户可以通过访问 Mint 选项卡、选择 Sneaker 并按下 Mint 来选择要“繁殖”的 Sneaker。两种年份都有 72 小时的铸币冷却时间，但在此期间它们仍可用于移动。在[此处](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/game-fi-elements/game-modes)了解铸币成本。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ynl7Z-hN2CSSWKXt4K0aB.png?height=491&width=524)\n\n**游戏模式**\n**独奏模式**\n\n用户通过穿着 NFT 运动鞋在单人模式中赚取代币。 需要能源才能赚取 $GST。 只有在用户获得 NFT 运动鞋后才会补充能量：1 能量等于 5 分钟的 Move-to-Earn 运动。\n\n**马拉松模式（开发中）**\n\n马拉松模式要求用户提前 24 小时在 Marathon Tab 下注册。 马拉松将每周和每月举行一次。 在[此处](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/game-fi-elements/game-modes)了解有关每周马拉松和每月马拉松的更多信息。\n\n‍\n\n**市场低迷影响STEPN**\nSTEPN 代币的价格随着整体熊市而下跌，因为治理代币和实用代币均较今年早些时候的历史高点下跌了 80% 至 98%。 在 4 月达到顶峰时，$GMT 和 $GST 分别为 4.19 美元和 9.36 美元。 此后，两个代币均呈下行趋势，形势严峻。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BB95hmxw_KfuZrctmK9mD.png?height=539&width=915)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MjYH-LHB-xtpUFDv0FUqM.png?height=531&width=911)\n\n一些社区成员将代币的急剧下降归因于 STEPN 应用程序在中国被禁止。\n\n*“自从中国禁赛以来，这就是一场大屠杀，价格大幅下跌，以至于对于小跑步者/步行者来说，去散步几乎没有回报。”一位 STEPN 用户和 BSC 新闻的密切接触者说。 “Solana 和 GST 的价格下降了，鞋子变得非常便宜（我的鞋子损失惨重）。”\n在 STEPN 流行的高峰期，用户可以通过在单人模式下在附近慢跑来赚取数百美元。即使使用基本运动鞋，也有可能以 9.36 美元的最高价格获得 3-4 美元 GST 的 NFT 每日奖励。目前，同样的步行，在 4 月份可以为用户赚取高达 40 美元的收益，但收益仅为 0.82 美元左右。*\n\n以前，使用 Solana NFT 的成本约为 600 美元，获得正的投资回报率大约需要 16 天。但目前，截至 7 月 14 日，购买最便宜的 Sneaker 的成本约为 69.88 美元。以目前的价格点，投资者需要大约 145 天才能达到收支平衡，每天的回报为 0.70 美元。结果，一些社区成员之间出现了看跌情绪。\n\n*“有些人还在玩游戏……我的意思是，距离禁令还有一个月的时间……如果我在中国，我会舒服地玩游戏，等到 7 月 10 日扔掉我的运动鞋离开。” STEPN Discord 的一位社区成员说。*\n\n**积极推动**\n该公司在一篇 [Medium](https://stepnofficial.medium.com/stepn-announces-q2-profits-initiates-quarterly-gmt-buyback-burn-32ad0b764de9) 帖子中表示，尽管过去几个月加密市场状况有所下降，但 STEPN 第二季度的利润为 1.225 亿美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tNy_7jzFFPyl7aPrSa51v.png?height=616&width=1400)\n\nM2E 协议计划利用其利润的 5% 为其 GMT 代币启动回购和销毁计划。然而，为防止价格突然波动，回购和销毁过程“可能需要几周时间才能完成”。\n\n此外，开发人员表示，除了回购和销毁计划之外，STEPN 将分配资本储备来改进现有功能并建立团队。尽管该协议面临挑战，但许多人仍然保持乐观。\n\n*“如果 STEPN 团队最终确定了他们的产品并开始了大规模的营销活动，那么事情仍然可能再次上升。散步或跑步的赚钱部分吸引了许多人，他们只是还不知道，或者还不习惯使用加密钱包，”一位接近 [BSC](http://bsc.news/) 新闻的 STEPN 成员说。 “为了让 STEPN 成功，我认为他们需要针对没有加密领域经验的人开展大型营销活动，我认为他们应该为不了解私钥等的人提供托管钱包。* ”\nSTEPN 报告称，该公司已经确定了几个投资其赚取资本的领域，以便改进游戏玩法。其中包括安全增强、防止机器人获得 GMT 的反作弊机制、建立开发人员和核心团队，以及确保赞助和合作伙伴关系。\n\n*“我投入了很多。我现在不担心回报，因为我专注于长期。现在，我正在增加我在两条链上的持股量，增加我的主要鞋子，并为第三领域做准备，”一位社区成员说。*\n\n\n在 [SOL](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/realm) 领域和 BNB 领域取得成功之后，STEPN 打算在以太坊上引入 [APE](https://www.web3wire.news/post/stepn-launches-realm-3-on-eth-announces-free-mint-for-bayc-holders) 领域*。*\n\n*STEPN 团队将这个 Realm 描述为“一个拥抱时尚和其他 NFT 社区的伟大实验”。*\n\n\nAPE Realm 将为所有 STEPN 用户提供对创新的新 Realm 的访问，专注于可访问性和引入新用户。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RZd8vfP9mrBZeJqn4hTO7.png?height=731&width=1600)\n\n**最后想法**\n\n 由于行业低迷，以及中国数据法禁止存储公民 GPS 数据，STEPN 不得不屏蔽中国用户。 此外，STEPN 的平台自推出以来一直受到一系列分布式拒绝服务 (DDoS) 攻击，导致用户在维护期间被警告“可能无法正确记录锻炼”。\n\n然而，如果 STEPN 克服了这些障碍，加密货币市场可能会成为一个蓬勃发展的行业。 此外，如果它的经济激励措施能激励一些人离开沙发开始行动，那也是一件好事。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HODPAuFIoOo_7W65NJXtt.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nSTEPN 社区在社交媒体上非常活跃，仅在 Twitter 上就有超过 640,000 名关注者。 许多用户在 NFT 市场上创造了高流动性，使升级后的运动鞋更容易出售。 最后但同样重要的是，即将到来的租赁升级和以太坊上的 Ape Realm 应该会增加用户群，增加所有代币的价值。\n\n‍\n\n**什么是步骤：**\nSTEPN 是一个结合了 GameFi 和 SocialFi 元素的 Web3 应用程序，允许用户 Move & Earn（移动和赚取）。 用户将通过步行、慢跑或户外跑步来获得游戏内代币。 STEPN 在 GST 和 GMT 两种代币机制下运行（治理代币，供应有限）。\n\n在哪里可以找到 StepN：\n\n[网站](http://stepn.com/) | [推特](https://twitter.com/Stepnofficial) | [不和谐](http://discord.gg/stepn2) | [白皮书](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/)", "timestamp": 1658301230, "digest": "6ZKHjsqW5wl8jEROhfuTuNjwMYr9Rin8FYJ056z0H1U", "contributor": "0xf1b622Da801ee602E3FfEE5262108Dd2b9149E88"}

After three days and nights of travel, they finally arrived at their destination.\n​​\nWhat surprised them was that there was an oasis of 15 square kilometers. There was a small village called Bissell in the oasis. The villagers were self-sufficient and never left here for generations.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uFSXAsrs8AUG7BapQo47P.png?height=266&width=474)\n\n\n​​\nIn recent years, they were forced by their living conditions and tried to leave the land again and again, but no matter which direction they walked, they finally returned to the same place again and again, which made them deeply confused.\n​​\nWhen Ken Levin learned about this situation, he became very interested and decided to reveal the mystery that has puzzled the villagers for thousands of years.\n​​\nThe next day, Ken Levin put away his compass and other navigation tools, hired two Bissells, and asked them to lead the way, trying to see why they couldn't get out of the desert. They prepared enough water and food for half a month, brought two camels, and started on the road.\n​​\nAfter 10 days, they had walked about 800 miles and still had not made it out of the desert. On the morning of the eleventh day, the familiar little oasis appeared before them, and they returned to Bissell.\n​​\nAt this time, Ken Levin finally revealed the mystery - the reason why the Bissells could not walk out of the desert was because they did not have a compass and did not know the Big Dipper. You must know that the two legs of all normal people are not absolutely equal. When walking in the endless desert by feeling, they will definitely walk in many circles, big and small, while Bissell is in the desert hinterland with a radius of thousands of kilometers. Compass, and they don't know the Big Dipper, their last footprints are likely to be in the shape of a tape measure, and eventually return to the starting point.\n​​\nAfter that, Ken Levine taught the Bissells to know the Big Dipper. Following the direction of the Big Dipper, they walked out of the desert in only three days.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/veO6ykDxf_lxNHvRAFPaT.png?height=270&width=402)\n\n\n​​\nBack at the Royal Academy of Sciences, Professor Ken Levine told his students about this personal experience in class. In the end, he said that many times, we are misunderstood by ability and perseverance, thinking that as long as we are diligent and persistent, we will succeed. Success, in fact, in the struggle, it is far from enough to rely on ability, determination and hard work. If you don't choose the right direction for success, no matter how good your wishes will be, you will be in vain.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ueOhzhuFYqvS6CQtxYXuZ.png?height=270&width=405)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658301300, "digest": "bYxSKNpvY78m0FCzxUqiC3TXhhafDJs9V5MNd94wHdY", "contributor": "0x20A82d328EEC024bE271ba5acD502939B3ee6394"}

3 级）。每个用户有四个神秘盒子插槽。神秘盒子有 10 种品质。收到神秘盒子后，倒计时会自动开始。当倒计时结束时，用户会花费少量 $GST（“基本成本”）来打开它。倒计时持续时间随着神秘盒子的质量而增加。\n\n**运动鞋质量**\n\n运动鞋有五种品质（普通、罕见、稀有、史诗和传奇）。铸造运动鞋时，每个属性的值都是在运动鞋质量决定的最小值和最大值之间随机选择的。因此，即使是相同品质的 Sneaker，也可能有着明显不同的属性等级。当达到某些里程碑时，用户需要消耗 $GMT 来升级他们的运动鞋。\n\n‍**制鞋业**\n\n在造鞋活动 (SME) 期间，用户使用他们拥有的两个运动鞋作为蓝图来“繁殖”，创建一个鞋盒。作为参考，这两款 Sneaker 将被称为 Vintages（父母）。\n\n为了开始 SME，两个 Vintage 都必须由用户拥有（非租用）并且完全耐用。然后，用户可以通过访问 Mint 选项卡、选择 Sneaker 并按下 Mint 来选择要“繁殖”的 Sneaker。两种年份都有 72 小时的铸币冷却时间，但在此期间它们仍可用于移动。在[此处](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/game-fi-elements/game-modes)了解铸币成本。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ynl7Z-hN2CSSWKXt4K0aB.png?height=491&width=524)\n\n**游戏模式**\n**独奏模式**\n\n用户通过穿着 NFT 运动鞋在单人模式中赚取代币。 需要能源才能赚取 $GST。 只有在用户获得 NFT 运动鞋后才会补充能量：1 能量等于 5 分钟的 Move-to-Earn 运动。\n\n**马拉松模式（开发中）**\n\n马拉松模式要求用户提前 24 小时在 Marathon Tab 下注册。 马拉松将每周和每月举行一次。 在[此处](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/game-fi-elements/game-modes)了解有关每周马拉松和每月马拉松的更多信息。\n\n‍\n\n**市场低迷影响STEPN**\nSTEPN 代币的价格随着整体熊市而下跌，因为治理代币和实用代币均较今年早些时候的历史高点下跌了 80% 至 98%。 在 4 月达到顶峰时，$GMT 和 $GST 分别为 4.19 美元和 9.36 美元。 此后，两个代币均呈下行趋势，形势严峻。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BB95hmxw_KfuZrctmK9mD.png?height=539&width=915)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MjYH-LHB-xtpUFDv0FUqM.png?height=531&width=911)\n\n一些社区成员将代币的急剧下降归因于 STEPN 应用程序在中国被禁止。\n\n*“自从中国禁赛以来，这就是一场大屠杀，价格大幅下跌，以至于对于小跑步者/步行者来说，去散步几乎没有回报。”一位 STEPN 用户和 BSC 新闻的密切接触者说。 “Solana 和 GST 的价格下降了，鞋子变得非常便宜（我的鞋子损失惨重）。”\n在 STEPN 流行的高峰期，用户可以通过在单人模式下在附近慢跑来赚取数百美元。即使使用基本运动鞋，也有可能以 9.36 美元的最高价格获得 3-4 美元 GST 的 NFT 每日奖励。目前，同样的步行，在 4 月份可以为用户赚取高达 40 美元的收益，但收益仅为 0.82 美元左右。*\n\n以前，使用 Solana NFT 的成本约为 600 美元，获得正的投资回报率大约需要 16 天。但目前，截至 7 月 14 日，购买最便宜的 Sneaker 的成本约为 69.88 美元。以目前的价格点，投资者需要大约 145 天才能达到收支平衡，每天的回报为 0.70 美元。结果，一些社区成员之间出现了看跌情绪。\n\n*“有些人还在玩游戏……我的意思是，距离禁令还有一个月的时间……如果我在中国，我会舒服地玩游戏，等到 7 月 10 日扔掉我的运动鞋离开。” STEPN Discord 的一位社区成员说。*\n\n**积极推动**\n该公司在一篇 [Medium](https://stepnofficial.medium.com/stepn-announces-q2-profits-initiates-quarterly-gmt-buyback-burn-32ad0b764de9) 帖子中表示，尽管过去几个月加密市场状况有所下降，但 STEPN 第二季度的利润为 1.225 亿美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tNy_7jzFFPyl7aPrSa51v.png?height=616&width=1400)\n\nM2E 协议计划利用其利润的 5% 为其 GMT 代币启动回购和销毁计划。然而，为防止价格突然波动，回购和销毁过程“可能需要几周时间才能完成”。\n\n此外，开发人员表示，除了回购和销毁计划之外，STEPN 将分配资本储备来改进现有功能并建立团队。尽管该协议面临挑战，但许多人仍然保持乐观。\n\n*“如果 STEPN 团队最终确定了他们的产品并开始了大规模的营销活动，那么事情仍然可能再次上升。散步或跑步的赚钱部分吸引了许多人，他们只是还不知道，或者还不习惯使用加密钱包，”一位接近 [BSC](http://bsc.news/) 新闻的 STEPN 成员说。 “为了让 STEPN 成功，我认为他们需要针对没有加密领域经验的人开展大型营销活动，我认为他们应该为不了解私钥等的人提供托管钱包。* ”\nSTEPN 报告称，该公司已经确定了几个投资其赚取资本的领域，以便改进游戏玩法。其中包括安全增强、防止机器人获得 GMT 的反作弊机制、建立开发人员和核心团队，以及确保赞助和合作伙伴关系。\n\n*“我投入了很多。我现在不担心回报，因为我专注于长期。现在，我正在增加我在两条链上的持股量，增加我的主要鞋子，并为第三领域做准备，”一位社区成员说。*\n\n在 [SOL](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/realm) 领域和 BNB 领域取得成功之后，STEPN 打算在以太坊上引入 [APE](https://www.web3wire.news/post/stepn-launches-realm-3-on-eth-announces-free-mint-for-bayc-holders) 领域\\*。\\*\n\n*STEPN 团队将这个 Realm 描述为“一个拥抱时尚和其他 NFT 社区的伟大实验”。*\n\nAPE Realm 将为所有 STEPN 用户提供对创新的新 Realm 的访问，专注于可访问性和引入新用户。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RZd8vfP9mrBZeJqn4hTO7.png?height=731&width=1600)\n\n**最后想法**\n\n由于行业低迷，以及中国数据法禁止存储公民 GPS 数据，STEPN 不得不屏蔽中国用户。 此外，STEPN 的平台自推出以来一直受到一系列分布式拒绝服务 (DDoS) 攻击，导致用户在维护期间被警告“可能无法正确记录锻炼”。\n\n然而，如果 STEPN 克服了这些障碍，加密货币市场可能会成为一个蓬勃发展的行业。 此外，如果它的经济激励措施能激励一些人离开沙发开始行动，那也是一件好事。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HODPAuFIoOo_7W65NJXtt.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nSTEPN 社区在社交媒体上非常活跃，仅在 Twitter 上就有超过 640,000 名关注者。 许多用户在 NFT 市场上创造了高流动性，使升级后的运动鞋更容易出售。 最后但同样重要的是，即将到来的租赁升级和以太坊上的 Ape Realm 应该会增加用户群，增加所有代币的价值。\n\n‍\n\n**什么是步骤：**\nSTEPN 是一个结合了 GameFi 和 SocialFi 元素的 Web3 应用程序，允许用户 Move & Earn（移动和赚取）。 用户将通过步行、慢跑或户外跑步来获得游戏内代币。 STEPN 在 GST 和 GMT 两种代币机制下运行（治理代币，供应有限）。\n\n在哪里可以找到 StepN：\n\n[网站](http://stepn.com/) | [推特](https://twitter.com/Stepnofficial) | [不和谐](http://discord.gg/stepn2) | [白皮书](https://whitepaper.stepn.com/)", "timestamp": 1658301544, "digest": "UpB2Wko21yi1s6f8Irhwte3tRrWlklDLrtisyMJdOJM", "contributor": "0xf1b622Da801ee602E3FfEE5262108Dd2b9149E88"}
