In the time since the provenance hash for Otherdeed NFT collection [was first written to the contract](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe3af78b358819e12ab1bee608e7e480e7897df3003b2afe754e8619f4205b113), three corrections have been made to the collection metadata, necessitating an update of the original hash on-chain. A summary of the corrections and instructions on how to compute the Otherdeed collection provenance on your own are below.\n\n## Summary of Metadata Corrections\n\n1. Due to a bug in the script used to generate the collection metadata, the `Rugged Pickaxe` artifact was incorrectly omitted from the metadata for Otherdeed NFTs that correctly depicted the artifact in the NFT image. This was updated shortly after the reveal.\n2. The `Stone Hole Jackson` Koda body type from the original Otherdeed collection metadata has been updated to `Stone Holes`. This was missed by the several rounds of audits by sensitivity readers.\n3. Due to developer oversight, a typo was included in the`Octo Tentaclenotinfinalcollection` Koda attribute, it is now `Octo Tentacle`\n\n## Verifying the Otherdeed Collection Provenance\n\nThe raw Otherdeed collection metadata as well as a Ruby script to reproduce the provenance hash are available [in this open source GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yuga-labs/land_provenance).", "timestamp": 1658273148, "digest": "3OhsFmFx9bq57rBixtKb0ekvDrlQjjpGuwidgJUB-dA", "contributor": "0xEc9f53fA69682833FBd760C104B5D61aE29221E0"}

This included experience and views from DAOs, other decentralised networks, the co-operative movement, Indigenous cultures, purpose-led business, and civic and systems innovation.\n\nWe explored perspectives on the essential functions and attributes of governance, and the design implications for governance arrangements that seek to foster decentralisation, pluralism, and regeneration.\n\nEach of the conversations were framed around a question (click the links to listen to a recording of the conversation):\n\n1. **June 2, 2022:** [Metagovernance -

Products need to move onto L2 networks\n2. Exchanges need to provide cheap on-ramps directly to L2\n3.

This was very clear in the “DeFi summer” of 2020, and the NFT explosion in 2021. Transaction fees became too expensive and it priced people out. Eventually, only whales could afford to make profitable trades in DeFi, and only large speculators would mint Yuga Labs NFTs in 2021.\n\n# Exchanges need to provide cheap on-ramps directly to L2 (for a few cents)\n\nWe shouldn’t expect users to buy ETH and bridge to L2. Users need to purchase L2 tokens directly from exchanges with fiat, and then send them cheaply into the L2 networks so that they can use those products. We should look at apps like Coinbase to help onboard users to L2. \n\n# Products and specifically wallets need to abstract L2 networks\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether someone uses MasterCard or Visa these days. All of the payment processors can handle either and they abstract the differences. The same thing needs to happen with L2 networks, and it’s likely the wallets the need to take on this task.\n\nDifferent products will launch on different L2s. It’ll be messy if we expect users to navigate all of the different L2s, and so wallets (Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, Argent, etc) need to abstract the L2s and provide ways to bridge between them seamlessly.

I tak rozumcie zk.money bo coś w tym jest. 😜\n\n \n Od razu napiszę, że nie mam się za jakiegoś GURU. Napiszę to co wiem, a wiem pewnie troszkę więcej niż ty ziom. Postaram się pisać językiem abyś mnie zrozumiał.  \n Jest to też potencjalna spekulacja. Większość osób ma oczy skierowane w kierunku **#StarkNet**. Ja zwykle stoję z boku i obserwuję podobne protokoły, które mają mniejszy socialhype i fajnie się rozwijają. Dlatego dziś będzie o zk.money a nie o StarkNet.\n\n## zk.money - warstwa 2 na ETH skupiona na prywatności 👀\n\n[zk.money](https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork) to dApps do ochrony prywatności w warstwie 2 umożliwiająca użytkownikom prywatne przesyłanie **$ETH, $DAI & $renBTC** ( renBTC *był w v1 ale v2 obecnie off - wróci, spokojnie*). Zk.Money jest zbudowane na silniku [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) (*Zk-Rollup na Eth)*.  \n Aztec jest porównywalny do [zkSync](https://medium.com/@CalendarDefi/airdrop-guide-zksync-zigzag-a83ef3b33b70), ale koncentruje się na prywatności, której w #zkSync brak imo.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XME4s721Yez0zhziC8YLK.png?height=891&width=2545)\n\n**Podam prosty przykład anonimowej wysyłki $ETH :**\n\n* **Deponujesz** *(shield) *$ETH **lub** $DAI z mainetu na **zk-money L2 \n **\n* Znając **alias *(login)*** drugiej osoby wysyłasz jej $ETH lub $Dai po L2 (sobie, delerowi, whatever). Koszt transakcji bardzo niski (L2). Dzięki technologi **zero-knowledge proof** druga strona otrzyma ETH, ale nie będzie wiadomo od kogo. Co ciekawsze ty jako wysyłający masz dostęp do potwierdzenia, że transakcja pochodzi od Ciebie (gdyby zaszła taka potrzeba to, to potwierdzisz).  \n **Nikt inny nie ma do tego dostępu bez twojego walletu!**  \n \n* Gdy zamiast aliasu odbiorcy podasz adres ethereum środki zostaną wysłane na mainet. I ten przykład w moim przypadku ma utility w kwestiach spekulacji & sybilu na multiwalletach. Rozumiesz schemat prawda? Ahhh, jak ja dużo Ci mówię…🤫\n\n## Dobra spekulancie, wiem co interesuje Cię najbardziej… Co ja tam mam robić niby, co?🤫\n\n[Zk.Money](https://zk.money/) i sieć [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) działają już na mainecie. Ani jedno, ani drugie nie ma jeszcze tokena. Czy będzie ? Czas pokaże. Ja obserwuje i klikam bo jara mnie ta technologia. Uważam, że *Satoshi Nakamoto* byłby dumny z tego co tu się odpierdala. Jak ktoś podchodzi do tematu czysto spekulacyjnie to uważam, że jest teraz na to dobry czas. Dlaczego? Niedawno przeszli na mainet. Ruski gas od Vitalika, też nie taki straszny, jak straszą nas w mediach głównego ścieku 🤮\n\n### Dobra - napiszę, co tam do przeklikania\n\nNa początek musisz wejść na [zk.money](https://zk.money/signup) połączyć portfel (np. Metamask) i stworzyć swój alias \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2WIEKnA3MGihB0EOc2p8B.png?height=993&width=1635)\n\nNastępnie podpisać kilka transakcji i go zarejestrować, po czym zdeponować minimum **0.01 ETH** w celu aktywacji konta.  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MB-G30l7eZtNDojkifd3f.png?height=2151&width=3117)\n\n**Włalaaaa - Done!** Masz już swój alias i interakcje z kontraktem.  \n  \n **UWAGA!** Zapisz swój alias bo gdy go utracisz -- utracisz swoje środki.  \n W zkmoney **.v1** gdy nie pamiętaliśmy swojego aliasu można było wygenerować nowy. W **.v2** jest to niemożliwe! \n  \n Warto pójść o krok dalej i popatrzyć co protokół ma nam do zaoferowania. \n Zk.Money V1 oferowało nam jedynie przesyłanie ETH, DAI i renBTC pomiędzy walletami L2 & Mainet. Team postanowił pójść o krok dalej. Obecnie rozwijają private-defi aby na warstwie drugiej poza zwykłym ‘anonimowym’ przesyłaniem wartości dostępne były swapy, stakinngi i inne bajery, które znamy z DEFI. Zaczeli z [LIDO](https://lido.fi/) (staking ETH dla ETH 2.0) - obecnie 4,38% APY. Druga opcja, która już jest wdrożona to staking DAI w współpracy z [ElementFi](https://www.element.fi/) . Znaleść to możemy w zakładce [EARN](https://zk.money/earn). Warto to przeklikać i wrzucić coś ETH do LIDO czy troche DAI do ElementFi na staking. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rS8YpDbaq0A3Kk8agtL7f.png?height=1188&width=2513)\n\n## 👇 Kolejne protokoły soooon ser 👇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i7DBEBz3n4o8U91Qs04DG.png?height=810&width=2494)\n\n## Co jeszcze warto zrobić?\n\n* Warto przerzucić assety z L2 na Mainet. Aby to zrobić przy wysyłce zamiast aliasu należy wkleić adres ETH *\\[0x…\\] \n *\n* Warto też przesłać asset po sieci L2. Aby to zrobić należy wkleić nie adres ETH, a alias odbiorcy. Możesz ‘posypać’ Popusiowi. Ahhh. Nie wypada tak mówić. Anyway, jak podoba Ci się, to co robie i tak bardzo chcesz - mój login masz na screenach wyżej. \n \n* Jeśli interesuje Cię więcej, warto dołączyć na [Discord](https://discord.gg/DePA3Uvd)\n\n### UWAGA!\n\n> Co do oficjalnej informacji o *#airdrop*.  Team nic takiego nie potwierdził.  \n Nie potwierdzili też tego, że kiedykolwiek powstanie token. Dodam, że większość potwierdzonych dropów wychodziła słabo. Zgodzisz się ze mną? \n *“…Cicha woda brzegi rwie!”*  \n\nNa koniec jeszcze jedna uwaga. Jeśli obserwujesz mnie dłużej to pewnie o zk.money już wiesz i bawiłeś się tam już na v1. Jeśli tak to zaloguj się na [old.zk.money](https://old.zk.money/) i przenieś swoje assety na L1 po czym dokonaj ponownej migracji na L2 tworząc nowy alias. Tak mi doradzono na discordzie i tak zrobiłem. \n\nTemat będę obserwował dalej. Jeśli Cię to zainteresowało zapraszam do mnie na telegram i twitter aby być na bieżąco.\n\n* [Twitter Popek1990.eth](https://twitter.com/popek1990crypto)\n* [Telegram Popek1990.ETH \\[Ogłoszenia\\]](https://t.me/popek1990crypto)\n\n```\nDyskusje w komentarzach na twitter ✌️\n```", "timestamp": 1658274549, "digest": "lWecFymSfagUdIlhOwLDJpjIBPlm-3qG4_FmT9vnfvU", "contributor": "0x4f0a57351c468842A6F0efE26597195A1F29e239"}

It is also Ethereum's first great alternative to the mainstream publishing platforms like Medium and WordPress.\n\n**Some of their highlights:**\n\n[https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x9F6F91078A5072A8B54695DAfA2374Ab3cCd603b](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x9F6F91078A5072A8B54695DAfA2374Ab3cCd603b)\n\n[https://ens.mirror.xyz/-eaqMv7XPikvXhvjbjzzPNLS4wzcQ8vdOgi9eNXeUuY](https://ens.mirror.xyz/-eaqMv7XPikvXhvjbjzzPNLS4wzcQ8vdOgi9eNXeUuY)\n\n[https://kitteh.mirror.xyz/editions/0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175/40](https://kitteh.mirror.xyz/editions/0x3725CA6034bcDBc3c9aDa649d49Df68527661175/40)\n\n## Importance of Mirror\n\nNow anyone could put out anything that they've published as NFTs, enabling their biggest fans to support them and become early investors in their work. Readers could send tips and receive tokens as a reward for supporting their favorite writers which results in building a vibrant community and Mirror provides smart contracts for crowd-funding a new initiative directly from the writings.\n\nAll this by completely circumventing advertisers who constantly interrupt your reading flow by getting in your face with messaging hints at every visit!\n\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1449909594516455426](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1449909594516455426)\n\n## How do Mirror Works?\n\nMirror uses Arweave to permanently store users' content. The average cost of storing data on the decentralized storage protocol currently is $0.01 per gigabyte, which Mirror takes care of for its users. In doing so, they are able to offer free publishing services. Additionally, unlike traditional online platforms that require strenuous login processes and accounts, Mirror uses\n\n\"Sign in with Ethereum\" method for authentication. It makes independent verification possible through non-Ethereum keypair that signs the posts and are stored in Arweave which then is paired with writers Ethereum address. Nobody has to disclose any private information, no need to sign up for an email account and no need for creation of a new password.\n\n## Key Features\n\n* **Mirror Editor**\n\nThis text editor and publisher lets users build posts with media blocks. eg: Images, crypto economic blocks, and embedded auctions.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editor](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editor)\n\n* **Crowd Funding**\n\nMirror lets users crowdfund a project, i.e. an Ethereum smart contract for raising funds, via its text and media blocks - like videos. Contributors receive a token(ERC20) that represents their participation and ownership in the project.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/crowdfunds](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/crowdfunds)\n\n* **Splits**\n\nSplit is an ERC20-compliant smart contract-based payments routing mechanism that lets creators allocate funds from auctions or donations to “collaborators, the people that have inspired you, or to donate proceeds from your work.”\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/splits](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/splits)\n\n* **Entry NFTs**\n\nPosts on Mirror can be minted as 1/1 non-fungible tokens. This means that they are collectors items that anyone who wants a souvenir of this moment in time or just an avid fan can help the creator get some financial backing for the creation of future projects!\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/mint-writing-nfts](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/mint-writing-nfts)\n\n* **Edition**\n\nA functionality for creating a limited supply of identical NFTs at a fixed price, e.g. 100 pieces of crypto-art. This new feature will bring about an exciting new implementation for non-fungible items and will allow users to create fixed editions, as well as trade and identify digital art through various methods on the blockchain with ease.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editions](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/editions)\n\n* **Entry Editions**\n\nCreators can use this tokenization system to mint their Mirror posts as limited-edition NFTs instead of 1/1s.\n\n* **Tokens**\n\nA decentralized frontend for easy ERC20 token minting and distribution of governance token to build vibrant communities.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/tokens](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/tokens)\n\n## How to create a Crowdfund?\n\n1\\.

It has funded notable projects including Uniswap, 1Inch, Yearn Finance, and more. It was founded by Scott Moore, Kevin Owocki, and Vivek Singh in November 2017.\n\n## Key features of Gitcoin\n\n**Earn:** Help develop public goods by offering bounties to those who work on open source projects, organize hackathons and other fundraisers sponsored by some of the most innovative Web3 organizations, or start a new initiative to help solve some of humanity’s most pressing coordination problems.\n\n* [Earn in bounties](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?network=mainnet&applicants=ALL&order_by=-_val_usd_db)\n* [Earn in hackathons](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons)\n* [Earn in grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/)\n\n**Learn:** Help build and shape the blockchain industry by participating in hackathons, workshops and roundtable discussions hosted by the experts of the industry. Or, if you’re looking for a more hands-on approach to learning material, why not do what some of our finest minds do and prepare yourself as one of them would? Find them, network with them, and study under their wing. That's right. They are offering a Kernel fellowship program so that you too can become a blockchain Kernel.\n\n* [Learn in a hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons)\n* [Learn through fellowship](https://www.kernel.community/en/)\n* [Learn through Quests](https://gitcoin.co/quests)\n\n**Connect:** Join the next generation of web developers as you connect and build with top open source developers in the space. Find peers who compliment your skillset and team up to take on bounties and hackathons. Or join their 8 week Kernel fellowship program online where they mentor, guide and support each other through hands-on training while engaging in weekly meet-ups and workshops!\n\n* [Connect through fellowship](https://www.kernel.community/en/)\n* [Connect through building](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons)\n\n**Funding:** Fund the open web and shape its future. Choose the projects and technology you believe are most vital to the health of this world, and contribute to them directly during quarterly Gitcoin Grants rounds which use quadratic funding.\n\n* [Fund grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/)\n\n## How do Gitcoin Grants work?\n\nIt starts with a Grant page, a pool of funds, and a community of contributors.\n\nGrants begin with a page for your project and a pool of matching funds. Using the power of quadratic funding, donors will signal their support for grantees and democratically decide where the matching funds should go.\n\nIf you’re a grantee, one of the important things to note is that the number and amount of each contribution to your project influences the total amount allocated to you. If you’re a contributor, even a small contribution can have a huge impact on the amount of matching funding a grantee gets .This is the power of quadratic funding.\n\nFor example:\n\n> Traditional matching<!-- -->Grant 1 gets $100.<!-- -->Grant 2 gets $100.<!-- -->At the end of the round, both grants get $100 in matching.\n\n> Gitcoin quadratic matching<!-- -->Grant 1 gets $100 from 1 funder.<!-- -->Grant 2 gets $100 from 10 funders.<!-- -->At the end of the round, Grant 1 gets $10 in matching, Grant 2 gets $190 in matching.\n\nSee how a number of small contributions can have a huge impact on the total amount of matching funding a grantee gets!\n\nGitcoin Grants is really all about communities coming together to help fund and signal support for public goods.\n\n### How to create a Grant?\n\n1\\.

{"id": "hPjDvcMc6L_tEeHPS6St6ETwjYMfoT1vIr6rytkvDzk", "title": "The DAO Story of FINE#8385", "body": "Hey! I am FINE & I am doing fine. I will be honest, I am no story teller but I want my story to be out there! Why? Because of the possibilities and opportunities that DAOs are offering right now for everyone. We are entering a new age, an age where age, color, caste, nationality, religion or nothing matters for earning or owning something. What you need is an internet connection and basic ideas about how these DAO things work to make a living, to build your empire or even To start a movement. Okay let's start.\n\nI am an 18year old boy in India working part time for DAOs. What will make most of you interested is the fact that I can earn more than 400 dollars  for a couple of hours mainly because of my knowledge in this field and guys I am just getting started. I know the amount is no big deal but the way I am earning it is something all of you should care about! Why? There is no escape from new technology, when the internet came everyone had no option but to go with it, that's how new tech works. Entered DAOs only in the beginning of march. In case you don't know what a DAO is, it is a decentralized autonomous organization that means an organization that runs by code and no major person has the final say and instead the community has the major say. How is all this possible? Well the answer is Blockchain technology. A new technology is also = things happening that never happened in human history before! Actually I have a lot to say and donno where to start. I may derail from the track from what I am saying so please stick with me.\n\nI got hyped about blockchain technology after watching the [comments of top tech leaders](https://youtu.be/GVN0Ddr3xig) on blockchain technology. I started just like most of the people, started trading crypto currency and lost money, my entry to crypto was in July 2021. Started heavily learning about everything from the [Coin Bureau](https://youtu.be/Fu4lrv47c0g) youtube channel and the journey of 8months led me to the gem DAOs!! \n\nI just lost interest in making money and wanted to follow my heart. I always wanted to serve humanity, so I setted out to start an organisation! An organisation where anyone can tell their problems and anyone can make a living for solving those problems! Ironically the organisation name is also FINE. I got this name from my Father, he is a hardworking man who just can't stop working!(farmer blood). Even though the project is still down I learned something. This is something I always knew but I think I fully understood it only when I experienced it. I was behind money making = no value. I was behind something of value to the world and all of a sudden I started earning! \n\nI went to ARAGON DAO to create and manage DAO as it is the go to place for everyone of DAOs, the community was really helpful specially anson parker. \n\nI saw a bounty there. They were looking for Hindi translators to translate their documents. I was 99% sure that I wouldn't get it, as there were many better candidates than me. Still I applied and I remember those lines \" Hey! I am a student and I understand 5 languages \" \n\nA person who goes by the Identity @Lion917 reached out to me and guided me to Bankless South Asia DAO!** \n **\n\nI started as a Malayalam translator there using my 4years old complaint phone Vivo Y55s. Pointing it out just to say that. We don't need a heavy setup to earn or start, it definitely helps but it would be better if we just start right away with what we have and trust me it is more than enough!\n\nNo one will judge you here. We just respect the effort and give maximum support expecting nothing in return! I had knowledge in blockchain space for the past 7months so it was not that kind of a big deal for me to trust everything. For a beginner it would be hard but the community will help you out. Beware of scams please.. There are plenty of them. Okay coming to the point. I am now working for an Internet community without knowing anyone's name and not revealing my own identity. Here skills matter more than certificates. I was getting paid in an internet currency or governance token. Hey, here is another big deal of working for DAOs. In our real life we get paid in fiat currency if we work for an organisation but here we get the share of the company i.e. governance token = you have a say or you can shape the future of the organisation you are working for!! About hierarchical structure, here we the contributors have the say. Let me get back to my experiences.\n\nI received my first payment at the end of the month and I felt sooo proud; it was proof that all my weird thoughts(for the majority) were true. This is an untaken path for the masses for now. I then started attending the weekly meetings which were more than amazing!! There is this Awesome guy called @0xbaer who made me really comfortable there. Guided me through everything and even helped me through everything. Another thing to point out is everybody is kind here. One reason is because if we are not we will be kicked. My 1st bounty work was pathetic. I understood it only later. They carefully started pointing out everything I did right and then requested me to make some parts better. Later I started attending weekly meetings which lead me to more opportunities. Attending meetings is another great way to get involved heavily.\n\nI then became a marketer, content creator, reviewer and even the coordinator! The growth was exponential. If I was going with the masses, I would be attending school and hating the things I should be learning etc etc but here, I was so damn interested in learning as everything was helping me right away. Actually I was getting paid for learning if we look through this angle. Reading newsletter = learning. I was learning and getting exposed to outside parties. I was getting guided In the right direction. I wanted to work full time for DAOs and started joining other DAOs and started using the same butterfly principle again. \n\nA guy named @enfin reached out to me and introduced peopleDAO and Language DAO! Attended some meetings and I am part of the accounting team, writer, multi Sig signer and Mod operator! I had no prior experience doing any of these!! \n\nThe point is everything is flexible here, if you are willing to take the effort this is a golden opportunity! I am a person who lives by the lines: Never trade time for money!! I am so comfortable here as there Is meaning for the time I am spending. I am getting ownership in the community! \n\nThere are no bad vibe hierarchies here. I have to speak about @jengajojo.eth. An amazing person, Leader of IMN. I am pretty sure he is super solid and busy! I didn't know it and was always reaching out to him for doubts and help. He was replying ASAP and helping, which doesn't make sense if we look at our traditional hierarchies. Can we just go to the MD and say: hey i don't know what to do! ? No right? I am not saying that there is no hierarchical structure here. In Fact we do and there is no escape from hierarchies in any creative domains. I just didn't know whom I should be talking to and I went to Jenga. 90% of the people you see here will be like that. That's what from my experience I understood. \n\nHey! Another thing, did you know that you could get paid just for chilling?? Well there are rewards for active community members also. What that literally means is a little earning just for being active in the community. I said little just because I don't want to sound like DAOs get rich quickly. When you are an experienced person with knowledge it is easy. We need ideas about these things mainly. For example we haven't learned how exactly you are able to read this but you know how to read and benefit from this! We don't fully understand the working mechanism behind calls but we do have business calls with it. What I am trying to say is as long as you have trust in all these things and the idea, you can do anything.\n\nWorking for DAOs is like having a taste of the future! \n\n** \n  \n  \n **", "timestamp": 1658275373, "digest": "OVoGs2Oxgt3bMJ4ObmTqsGAHtRdftZaJVP1H7Ed_cW0", "contributor": "0x155250d3465Fc910a910b7C67d20C4Dd25fcb728"}

Yet, we are still pouring our money into luxuries which diminish the state of our earth. If we don’t do something to support the environment, the earth will truly be f\\*cked.\n\n## Our mission\n\nWe are living in a capitalistic system driven by money: making money the most effective driver for change. To renew the economy into a greener one, we must channel more economic activity and funding into sustainable companies.\n\n### Current philanthropic organizations are not effective\n\nOne of the major entities in supporting social impact initiatives is philanthropic organizations. But, they operate confidentially. So, when we intend to donate our pocket change toward global causes, we don’t know where the money really ends up.\n\nMoreover, philanthropic organizations aim to address the short-term hurdle (ex. logging). We believe that investing in scalable projects that overcome sustainable problems at their roots\n\n### Blockchain enables everyone to invest in sustainable impact\n\nFor the last decade, groups of wealthy investors all over the world have been working to support, and invest in social impact initiatives and innovations. Yet, we, everyday investors are left out due to the lack of infrastructure.\n\nWe envision a community, regardless of contribution amount, that can band together to invest in sustainable impact.\n\nThrough recent explorations using blockchain technology, new forms of decentralized communities emerged and paved the path for making this a reality.\n\nWe are using a DAO to create a democratized and inclusive investment community thats scalable.\n\n## What we are working on\n\nWe are building ArborDAO, a DAO that collectively invests in sustainability startups using crypto.\n\nWe want to become an early fund for green founders who are seeking support, a collective investment community through crypto, and a community bridge for anyone to support green projects.\n\n## We need you!\n\nEveryone is welcome to ArborDAO.

Yet, we are still pouring our money into luxuries which diminish the state of our earth. If we don’t do something to support the environment, the earth will truly be f\\*cked.\n\n## Our mission\n\nWe are living in a capitalistic system driven by money: making money the most effective driver for change. To renew the economy into a greener one, we must channel more economic activity and funding into sustainable companies.\n\n### Current philanthropic organizations are not effective\n\nOne of the major entities in supporting social impact initiatives is philanthropic organizations. But, they operate confidentially. So, when we intend to donate our pocket change toward global causes, we don’t know where the money really ends up.\n\nMoreover, philanthropic organizations aim to address the short-term hurdle (ex. logging). We believe that investing in scalable projects that overcome sustainable problems at their roots\n\n### Blockchain enables everyone to invest in sustainable impact\n\nFor the last decade, groups of wealthy investors all over the world have been working to support, and invest in social impact initiatives and innovations. Yet, we, everyday investors are left out due to the lack of infrastructure.\n\nWe envision a community, regardless of contribution amount, that can band together to invest in sustainable impact.\n\nThrough recent explorations using blockchain technology, new forms of decentralized communities emerged and paved the path for making this a reality.\n\nWe are using a DAO to create a democratized and inclusive investment community thats scalable.\n\n## What we are working on\n\nWe are building ArborDAO, a DAO that collectively invests in sustainability startups using crypto.\n\nWe want to become an early fund for green founders who are seeking support, a collective investment community through crypto, and a community bridge for anyone to support green projects.\n\n## We need you!\n\nEveryone is welcome to ArborDAO.

{"id": "DtKcyENfhxjKVFkmZCkg4WLUn3l-KqFnjW2SSO4xIzk", "title": "Web3: Narratives of Disruption", "body": "Instead of pursuing a false debate on whether this next-generation technology should be centralized or decentralized, we should ask how best can we arrange the narrative for desirable decentralization. This engaging narrative is constructed by making the mission and objectives among Web3 platforms more about coordination. In turn, this will create a space that allows individuals to maintain ownership and autonomy of the internet and its foundations. This is not some kind of freakish fiction but rather a reality of what is possible in today's Web3 repository. Through innovative technologies (NFT platforms, currency exchange, and wallet providers) in tandem with people-powered initiatives, Web3 is blossoming into a system of efficiently solving the problem found in centralized systems. Allowing self-sovereign identities their right for communication, privacy, and governance, but that doesn't come without its obstacles.\n\n**Objective / Disclaimer**\n\nWeb3 is unfolding into new territories daily, building communities to find each other, holding themselves accountable towards the same mission and connecting with others. As a disclaimer to you reading this post, I am not an expert. I am naturally a researcher and enthusiast of the possibilities behind Web3 and decentralized narratives. I hope that by the time you finish reading this, you feel more familiar with Web3 and how decentralization plays a crucial role in facilitating the new narratives of what the internet was always meant to serve. I also strongly encourage everyone to always do as a motto states and \"Do your own research\" (DYOR) as a practice.\n\n**Pre-requisite**\n\nLet's start with Web1, which started around the early 90s, a version of the internet that was a space where consumers were primarily users on an open network of information (the read-only era). What Web1 had was many barriers to entry because of how technical the user experience was, which excluded the majority from using the internet. Leading us into the Web2 age, the centralization age came in with fewer barriers to entry due to big tech platforms such as Yahoo and Google who provided us with excellent user experience interfaces. This grew the consumer demand at scale. Most of us use this version today, where the primary focus is targeted advertisements and lack of privacy heralded by the arrival of social media. The Web2 internet we know today has needed the reliance on centralized intermediaries (Google, Meta, Amazon).\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nThe main principle of Web3 is decentralization. Rather than being controlled by Big Tech, governments, financial institutions, or large corporations, it's entirely run by a community of individuals seeking to make a difference to combat our current Web2 form. This Web2 form has been governed by addictive, abrasive, and controlling narratives that I believe users are fed up with. Now, the technology underpinning Web3 makes it possible for far more inventive open-source and decentralized systems to be created — and enables decentralized economies (based on Blockchain systems that incentivize the stakeholders, developers, contributors, and consumers alike) to form around them. When this happens successfully will enable the products and services of Web3 to compete with and eventually surpass those of Web2.\n\n**Opportunity**\n\nCreatives now have an opportunity to leverage this technology and set it up to become a significant driver of economic growth. This can alter the workforce economy into new realms of possibility to significantly impact how we operate as a society (think about how DAOs, NFTs, and the Metaverse can help play this out?!). This is where I find the most utopic possibility in Web3, where the creator economy and the workforce collide. Bringing artists, lawyers, developers, and creators together from around the globe to create ideas and monetize them globally in permissionless crypto-economic systems— and essentially defining the future of work.\n\n**Value Creation**\n\nIdeas and community contributions of working toward a shared goal that gains value over time (through individuals who feed that value creation) are gaining momentum in various social communities (Friends with benefits, Forefront, and Party DAO). A concept that results in an ecosystem of equity that doesn't exclude the niche. The governing principle behind Web 3 takes us back to the idea we spoke about at the start of this post around Web1 which was the first version of open-source visions, so we are right back where we started. In a space filled with skeptics, naysayers, and the uninterested, my advice to you is to find where your area is in Web3 and begin to implement the change you want to see in the future. This isn't going anywhere, nor is it a hoax— It's the early stages of something completely new and has the potential to be shaped by the right set of values.\n\n**Here a list of some fun places to start:** \n\n* <https://decentraland.org/>\n* <https://rabbithole.gg/>\n* <https://rally.io/>\n* <https://mirror.xyz/>\n* <https://dune.com/home>\n* <https://www.radardao.xyz/>\n* <https://chain.link/>\n* <https://forefront.market/feed>\n* <https://www.fwb.help/>\n* <https://party.mirror.xyz/>\n* <https://gitcoin.co/>\n* <https://flamingodao.xyz/>\n* <https://snapshot.org/#/>\n* <https://rabbithole.gg/>", "timestamp": 1658277879, "digest": "wZskKFe00TcXfxQLMS2HzfNKpC6PijWU7xlNAmbNCy0", "contributor": "0xF1F144271438B53c38Bc502D804878D7b295e563"}

Sushiswap also received a decent chunk from this airdrop.\n\n[https://twitter.com/SushiSwap/status/1306493893492449281?s=20&t=4gg1SnKkzX7f4lyyQepguQ](https://twitter.com/SushiSwap/status/1306493893492449281?s=20&t=4gg1SnKkzX7f4lyyQepguQ)\n\nOver the past two years though, Uniswap has undoubtedly been the winner with the largest DEX market share amongst the two and the Dex market in general. Innovation keeps winning!\n\n## Section 1: Airdrop Recipients $UNI Holdings\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064174/1827931/16bce33c-b27d-478c-acef-e6a20ee5898b?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064174/1827931/16bce33c-b27d-478c-acef-e6a20ee5898b?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064174/1827935/cb95ab2c-bdee-4a49-919c-2f4d2e4c195c?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064174/1827935/cb95ab2c-bdee-4a49-919c-2f4d2e4c195c?display=iframe)\n\nAs seen in the query above, \\~220k addresses have claimed their $UNI tokens and they have claimed a total of \\~136M $UNI tokens. At that time of writing, that $UNI is worth just over $1Billion. That begets the question, what’s the current balance of $UNI tokens held by the $UNI airdrop recipients?\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1037563/1789711/974d8953-f73e-4b4b-81d0-69050943a0ae?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1037563/1789711/974d8953-f73e-4b4b-81d0-69050943a0ae?display=iframe)\n\nAs seen in the chart above, the balance of $UNI held by airdrop recipients has been declining since the airdrop to a current balance of 12.7M $UNI tokens. That is currently only \\~8.5% of the $UNI tokens that was claimed. \n\nThe highest balance (66.7M $UNI held by $UNI airdrop recipients was on September 27th 2020 (just over a week from when the airdrop was announced).\n\nI thought it would be interesting to dig more into this data, so I created two Pie charts that divided the Airdrop recipients into the following profiles:\n\n**Non $UNI Holder** - Addresses that no longer hold $UNI \n**Plankton** - Addresses that hold less than 10k $UNI \n**Shrimp** - Addresses that hold more than 10k $UNI \n**Fish** - Addresses that hold more than 100k $UNI\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1041370/1796243/35ed3031-57b5-466f-b266-e577394ed940?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1041370/1796243/35ed3031-57b5-466f-b266-e577394ed940?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1041370/1796284/4d394f53-0792-4c28-ac06-fd56dac100d8?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1041370/1796284/4d394f53-0792-4c28-ac06-fd56dac100d8?display=iframe)\n\nSimilar to the balance of $UNI held by airdrop recipients, this pie chart is dominated by addresses that no longer hold $UNI tokens - 89.2%.\n\n## Section 2: Top 100 Airdrop Recipients $UNI Holdings\n\nSection 1 analysis would be incomplete if we didn’t look at what the top airdrop recipients were up to. In this [query](https://dune.com/queries/1037369) you can find the top 100 airdrop recipients and how much $UNI they received.\n\nThe top 100 addresses received 30M $UNI in total and currently hold a balance of \\~3.12M $UNI tokens. The ratio of the amount they claimed and current balance is very similar to what we found for all airdrop recipients in Section 1.\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1037407/1789661/5285a353-148c-4620-aa6a-2604a317a722?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1037407/1789661/5285a353-148c-4620-aa6a-2604a317a722?display=iframe)\n\nI created charts of the daily outflows, inflows and netflows for the Top 100 Airdrop recipients and also all airdrop recipients.\n\nIf you want to dig deeper then you can find them [here](https://dune.com/Henrystats/uniswap-2020-airdop-recipients).\n\n## Section 3: Airdrop Recipients Governance Participation\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053492/1812862/dbb4d3a3-e949-482a-8c94-c3aef88f2a90?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053492/1812862/dbb4d3a3-e949-482a-8c94-c3aef88f2a90?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053492/1812865/7e4389b5-7413-45f6-98e1-333bb1716979?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053492/1812865/7e4389b5-7413-45f6-98e1-333bb1716979?display=iframe)\n\nAs seen in the counters above, airdrop recipients have delegated \\~19.3M $UNI of the total 220M $UNI ever delegated.\n\nThe below charts show the total delegated uni vs airdrop recipients delegated uni over time and the number of uni delegators vs airdrop recipients delegators.\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053454/1812756/5b3e304c-473e-44fc-a70a-b4eae423938e?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053454/1812756/5b3e304c-473e-44fc-a70a-b4eae423938e?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053062/1812725/ccc9e1af-6634-44a3-b744-a5b8dabd267f?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053062/1812725/ccc9e1af-6634-44a3-b744-a5b8dabd267f?display=iframe)\n\n**N.B this doesn’t filter for addresses that do not hold $UNI anymore. I’ve created counters to get the number of delegators that still hold $UNI.**\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053963/1829103/cb487cb9-8e33-47e5-b1f3-2ce7be670d1f?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053963/1829103/cb487cb9-8e33-47e5-b1f3-2ce7be670d1f?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1053995/1829108/d9fed0a9-0bd3-42c5-8f4d-cb9bf549f356?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1053995/1829108/d9fed0a9-0bd3-42c5-8f4d-cb9bf549f356?display=iframe)\n\n## Section 4: Airdrop Recipients Protocol Usage\n\nIn this section, we’ll be looking at our airdrop recipients and their interaction with Uniswap. The first charts we’ll look at is a profile of airdrop recipients defined by the number of trades they’ve made on Uniswap.\n\n**Here are the profiles:**\n\n**Airdrop Seller** - Recipients that made only one transaction \n**Frequent trader** - Recipients that made more than one transaction \n**Active trader** - Recipients that made more than 100 transactions \n**Baby Dolphin Trader** - Recipients that made more than 1000 transactions \n**Dolphin Trader** - Recipients that made more than 10k transactions\n**Whale Trader** - Recipients that made more than 100k transactions\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1045343/1803079/245298e7-fd05-43d7-8707-f7d6d575d5cc?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1045343/1803079/245298e7-fd05-43d7-8707-f7d6d575d5cc?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1045343/1803181/14fcb2bd-f36d-43c1-80f2-62ed9811b1dc?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1045343/1803181/14fcb2bd-f36d-43c1-80f2-62ed9811b1dc?display=iframe)\n\nAs seen in the chart above, the airdrop recipients traded majorly on V2 with \\~180k traders, compared to V3’s \\~60k traders. There were also in total \\~40k recipients that traded only once.\n\nPie Charts do more justice to this data, so here’s some:\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803419/4b825fc9-0b9c-4964-b162-913be22397e2?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803419/4b825fc9-0b9c-4964-b162-913be22397e2?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803427/478bccba-ec0b-4e06-b646-76fdbf2714a1?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803427/478bccba-ec0b-4e06-b646-76fdbf2714a1?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803574/cb878621-6852-4433-81bb-f1194e5d1272?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1046113/1803574/cb878621-6852-4433-81bb-f1194e5d1272?display=iframe)\n\nInteresting to note that even though there were \\~11m more transactions on V2 than there was on **V3**, the volume traded on **V3** was much higher with a difference of roughly **$100bn**.\n\nThere was in total **\\~$244bn** traded on Uniswap by Airdrop Recipients. That is amazing!\n\n### What were the most traded pairs?\n\nIn this [query](https://dune.com/queries/1046417) you’ll find the top 100 most traded pairs.\n\n**WETH/USDC (V3)** was the largest traded pair with over **$100bn** in volume and a whooping **465k** trades.\n\nFrom the query linked above, all top 10 most traded pairs had at least one of **WETH** or a Stablecoin (**USDC**, **DAI** & **USDT**).\n\n### Total liquidity deposited on Uniswap?\n\nLiquidity provision is very important to Uniswap Protocol, so it’s important to also look at the sum of assets deposited in liquidity pools by airdrop recipients.\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1052639/1811756/3399333e-2032-4dbf-aad0-8735e34851e6?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1052639/1811756/3399333e-2032-4dbf-aad0-8735e34851e6?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1046816/1811718/66a503fc-ede6-4c76-b70d-715b9066d018?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1046816/1811718/66a503fc-ede6-4c76-b70d-715b9066d018?display=iframe)\n\n**\\~$247bn** was deposited by airdrop recipients, that is a lot! There’s also no surprise that the two most deposited assets were **WETH** & **USDC**. Both account for **\\~$211bn** of the total value deposited.\n\n## Section 5: Airdrop Recipients that Received Other Airdrops\n\nIn this section we look at some of the most popular airdrops in the Defi space since the launch of Uniswap’s airdrop and see which of the Uniswap airdrop recipients received these airdrops.\n\n### ENS Airdrop\n\n[Airdrop Info](https://cointelegraph.com/news/early-ethereum-name-service-ens-adopters-rewarded-with-a-hefty-five-figure-airdrop)\n**Date: November, 8th, 2021.**\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828837/b23af0dd-f2e9-4521-94e0-c97116dc3012?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828837/b23af0dd-f2e9-4521-94e0-c97116dc3012?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828839/56a720b6-e5c6-40d2-8263-84c1b0ca79d4?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828839/56a720b6-e5c6-40d2-8263-84c1b0ca79d4?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828841/d3dc22d4-8407-433d-9d7b-fd6bfff583b6?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828841/d3dc22d4-8407-433d-9d7b-fd6bfff583b6?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828845/3172aed2-3a8e-44ed-a83e-cd60a19c974c?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828845/3172aed2-3a8e-44ed-a83e-cd60a19c974c?display=iframe)\n\n[https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828851/fb1f9217-dd2d-48d1-a265-def9a6ae4b1e?display=iframe](https://dune.com/embeds/1064587/1828851/fb1f9217-dd2d-48d1-a265-def9a6ae4b1e?display=iframe)\n\nFull dashboard [here](https://dune.com/Henrystats/uniswap-2020-airdop-recipients).", "timestamp": 1658279514, "digest": "jsNVzaVx-3BkqmdHR_VPwsjR0JZD0nUwa-2tf7zDXdU", "contributor": "0xe5fF2C80759db9408dC9fD22b155b851Cd5aAA94"}

Joke, ale tak należy rozumieć zk.money i stojące za tym zkSNARK bo coś w tym jest 😜\n\n \n Od razu napiszę, że nie mam się za znachora w tym temacie. Napiszę to co wiem ✌️Postaram się pisać językiem, abyś mnie zrozumiał/a.  \n Jest to też potencjalna spekulacja. Większość osób ma oczy skierowane w kierunku **#StarkNet**. A Popek obserwuję podobne protokoły, które mają mniejszy socialhype, a zarazem fajnie się rozwijają - no i tokena brak. Dlatego dziś będzie o zk.money, a nie o StarkNet.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2K-1MxaAX1hUd0dQuMUUs.png?height=607&width=1694)\n\n## zk.money - warstwa 2 na ETH skupiona na prywatności 👀\n\n**[zk.money](https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork)** to *dApps* do ochrony prywatności w warstwie 2 umożliwiający użytkownikom prywatne przesyłanie **$ETH, $DAI & $renBTC** ( renBTC *był w v1 ale v2 obecnie off - wróci imo*). Zk.Money jest zbudowane na silniku [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) (*Zk-Rollup na Eth)* w technologi zkSNARK . Aztec jest porównywalny do [zkSync](https://medium.com/@CalendarDefi/airdrop-guide-zksync-zigzag-a83ef3b33b70), ale koncentruje się na prywatności, której w zkSync brak. Więcej o ich wizji przeczytasz [tutaj](https://aztec.network/vision).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XME4s721Yez0zhziC8YLK.png?height=891&width=2545)\n\n**Podam prosty przykład anonimowej wysyłki $ETH aby Ci to bardziej zobrazować:**\n\n* **Deponujesz** *(shield) *$ETH **lub** $DAI z mainetu na **zk-money L2 \n **\n* Znając **alias *(login)*** drugiej osoby wysyłasz jej $ETH lub $Dai po L2 (sobie, delerowi, whatever). Koszt transakcji bardzo niski (L2). Dzięki technologi **zero-knowledge proof** druga strona otrzyma ETH, ale nadawca nie będzie znany.  \n Co ciekawsze ty jako wysyłający masz dostęp do potwierdzenia, że transakcja pochodzi od Ciebie (gdyby zaszła taka potrzeba to, to potwierdzisz).  \n **Nikt inny nie ma do tego dostępu bez twojego walletu!**  \n \n* Gdy zamiast aliasu odbiorcy podasz adres ethereum środki zostaną wysłane na mainet. I ten przykład w moim przypadku ma utility w kwestiach spekulacji na multiwalletach. Wiesz sybil i te sprawy. Czaisz, prawda? Ahhh, jak ja dużo Ci mówię…🤫\n\n## Dobra skończ pie\\*\\*\\* Popku, przejdź do konkretów i mów co to, i po co mi to? 🤫\n\n[Zk.Money](https://zk.money/) i sieć [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) działają już na mainecie. Ani jedno, ani drugie nie ma jeszcze tokena. Czy będzie ? Czas pokaże. Ja obserwuje i klikam bo jara mnie ta technologia. Uważam, że *Satoshi Nakamoto* byłby dumny z tego z tej technologii. Jak ktoś podchodzi do tematu czysto spekulacyjnie to uważam, że jest teraz na to dobry czas. Dlaczego? Niedawno przeszli na mainet. Ruski gas od Vitalika, też nie taki straszny, jak straszą nas w mediach głównego ścieku 🤮\n\n### Sounds good? Dobra klikamy… 🤔\n\nNa początek musisz wejść na [zk.money](https://zk.money/signup) połączyć portfel (np. Metamask) i stworzyć swój alias *(nick)*. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2WIEKnA3MGihB0EOc2p8B.png?height=993&width=1635)\n\nNastępnie podpisać kilka transakcji i go zarejestrować, po czym zdeponować minimum **0.01 ETH** w celu aktywacji konta.  \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MB-G30l7eZtNDojkifd3f.png?height=2151&width=3117)\n\n**Włalaaaa - Done!** Masz już swój alias i interakcje z kontraktem. Wen drop? Za co drop? Trudno wyczuć… A więc czytaj dalej ziom, to zwiększy twoją szansę. \n  \n **UWAGA!** Zapisz swój alias bo gdy go utracisz -- **utracisz swoje środki**.  \n W zk.money **.v1** gdy nie pamiętaliśmy swojego aliasu można było wygenerować nowy. W **.v2** jest to niemożliwe! \n  \n Warto pójść o krok dalej i popatrzyć co protokół ma nam do zaoferowania. \n **Zk.Money V1** oferowało nam jedynie przesyłanie ETH, DAI i renBTC pomiędzy walletami L2 & Mainet. Team postanowił pójść o krok dalej. Obecnie rozwijają private-defi, aby na warstwie drugiej poza zwykłym ‘anonimowym’ przesyłaniem wartości dostępne były swapy, stakinngi i inne bajery, które znamy z DEFI. Zaczeli z [LIDO](https://lido.fi/) (staking ETH dla ETH 2.0) - obecnie *4,38% APY*. Druga opcja, która już jest wdrożona to staking DAI w współpracy z [ElementFi](https://www.element.fi/) . Znaleść to możemy w zakładce [EARN](https://zk.money/earn). Warto to przeklikać i wrzucić coś ETH do LIDO czy trochę DAI do ElementFi na staking. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rS8YpDbaq0A3Kk8agtL7f.png?height=1188&width=2513)\n\n## 👇 Kolejne protokoły soooon ser 👇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i7DBEBz3n4o8U91Qs04DG.png?height=810&width=2494)\n\n## Co jeszcze warto zrobić?\n\n* Warto przerzucić assety z L2 na Mainet. Aby to zrobić przy wysyłce zamiast aliasu należy wkleić adres ETH *\\[0x…\\] \n *\n* Warto też przesłać asset po sieci L2. Aby to zrobić należy wkleić nie adres ETH, a alias odbiorcy. Możesz ‘posypać’ Popusiowi. Ahh, jak to słodko brzmi 😂 \n Anyway, jak podoba Ci się, to co robię i tak bardzo chcesz - mój login masz na screenach wyżej. Donate & spekulacja 2w1. Opcjonalnie możesz wysłać sobie na drugi wallet. I do tego zachęcam. Popek nie żebrak o_0  \n \n* Jeśli interesuje Cię temat, warto dołączyć do nich na [Discord](https://discord.gg/DePA3Uvd) i się troszkę poudzielać. Może w przyszłości będą jakieś role? A może drop na podstawie napisanych znaków na ich discordzie tak jak to było chociażby na Lyra.Finance (optimism). Tak - tak było. Sam się na to załapałem i wpadło sympatycznie 😉\n\n### UWAGA!\n\n> Co do oficjalnej informacji o *#airdrop*.  Team nic takiego nie potwierdził.  \n Nie potwierdzili też tego, że kiedykolwiek powstanie token. Dodam, że większość potwierdzonych dropów wychodziła słabo. Zgodzisz się ze mną? \n *“…Cicha woda brzegi rwie!”*\n\nNa koniec jeszcze jedna uwaga. Jeśli obserwujesz mnie dłużej to pewnie o zk.money już wiesz i bawiłeś się tam już na v1. Jeśli tak to zaloguj się na [old.zk.money](https://old.zk.money/) i przenieś swoje assety na L1 po czym dokonaj ponownej migracji na L2 tworząc nowy alias.

{"id": "lv9__ZCL2e7SxFqwJ8kCqPxaeAtWOnL4GJ-wuCvrlDA", "title": "Reveel - Manifesto", "body": "*Introducing [Reveel](https://www.r3vl.xyz/), the financial stack for Web3 collaboration.*\n\n## The Future of Collaboration\n\nThe crypto movement, since its very beginning, has aimed to disrupt industries by shifting the balance of power back from intermediaries to end users.\n\nAs Web3 has emerged, artists, creative entrepreneurs, and builders - we’ll call them creators - have been drawn to this technology for that very reason. Indeed, this creative class has long been on the short end of the stick, subject to gatekeepers & centralized platforms that capture a vast portion of the value created by their art, their content, and their business.\n\nDecentralization & ownership, the core principles of Web3, offer these creators new opportunities to develop, manage, and monetize their work & their communities.\n\nThese principles also offer new ways to collaborate. When ideas, talent, and resources are distributed, new and more fluid collectives surface to deliver on projects. Similarly, **when ownership is pushed to the edges of the network, to its users, collaboration becomes shared property. And shared interest becomes shared equity**.\n\nBut the blockchain is still a nascent technology and its adoption by creators still requires an advanced level of technical knowledge which greatly reduces accessibility to Web3. For the technology to facilitate collaboration & deliver on its promise to creators, many building blocks still need to be developed.\n\nOne of those building blocks is a financial stack that supports the shift towards this new way of working together and offers creators a fluid revenue sharing & revenue management solution. **A building block to unleash Web3 collaboration**.\n\n## Reveel\n\nWe’ve started **[Reveel](https://www.r3vl.xyz/)** to create that building block.\n\nAt its core, Reveel strives to become a financial layer for collaboration in Web3 - **the financial stack for Web3 collaboration** - and a bedrock for creators to grow upon.\n\nWe understand that collaboration can generate friction: How do creators identify partnership opportunities? How and when do collaborators get paid? How do collectives define & monitor success?\n\nWe believe **transparency & equity** are the fundamental pillars that will enable products to solve these challenges & deliver on the promise to make collaboration simpler. This is why Reveel is building a platform that helps creators visualize and understand their on-chain income & automate the distribution of revenue amongst collaborators, rights holders, and partners.  \n In other words, Reveel is built for creators, artists, builders & brands that generate revenue on-chain and want to have more time to focus on what they do best: create.\n\nWith the support of our amazing backers, including [Binance Labs](https://labs.binance.com/) & [Moment Ventures](https://www.momentventures.com/), we’ve been able to bring together a rockstar team of seasoned Web3 developers, experienced venture builders & international touring artists, to deliver on our vision.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y4Pwd71qYD9glaxusaxf5.png?height=994&width=1705)\n\n## Announcing Reveel (v0.1)\n\nOur team is excited to announce that we are rolling out the first iteration of the platform: **[Reveel v0.1](https://app.r3vl.xyz/)**.\n\nOur initial beta includes a Revenue Share Protocol and a suite of Creator Analytics tools.\n\nThe **Revenue Share Protocol** allows creators to design & deploy their own Revenue Path (revenue share smart contract) in order to automatically split on-chain revenue with collaborators. The protocol has been implemented in a trustless, gas-efficient, and fully decentralized way. Funds can be sent to a Revenue Path and any listed recipient can withdraw their share of funds at any time, without the approval or action of any other collaborator on the smart contract, thus simplifying the revenue management aspect of collaboration.\n\nThe **Creator Analytics** offers the very first NFT analytics tool designed not just for collectors, but also for the creators themselves. Creators can track their entire catalog of NFT drops, compare their performance & draw valuable insights that guide their decision-making for future releases. Additionally, Creator Analytics allows users to track and understand their collector base, segment holders based on a variety of filters, and download collector lists. With this, Reveel allows creators to better understand how their revenue is generated and what projects & collaborations help them grow their community & their income.\n\nAs we launch Reveel, we’re fortunate to have outstanding partners, such as [Venice Music](https://www.venicemusic.co/), [Glass.xyz](https://glass.xyz/), [wavWRLD](https://wavwrld.com/), [BlackDave](https://blackdaveblackdave.com/), [Sammy Arriaga](https://sammynft.com/) and many more, who are pushing the boundaries of what it means to create & collaborate in Web3.\n\n## Join Us\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more, would like to get involved, or have a need for what we’re building, we encourage you to [reach out](http://discord.gg/r3vl).\n\nOur current version of the Revenue Share Protocol (v0.1) is in open beta and is totally free to use.

{"id": "VXVVsN3LzHp2NNxAifUZQCM-w0V5eAekw7AOdGEU9x8", "title": "Web3: Narratives of Disruption", "body": "Instead of pursuing a false debate on whether this next-generation technology should be centralized or decentralized, we should ask how best can we arrange the narrative for desirable decentralization. This engaging narrative is constructed by making the mission and objectives among Web3 platforms more about coordination. In turn, this will create a space that allows individuals to maintain ownership and autonomy of the internet and its foundations. This is not some kind of freakish fiction but rather a reality of what is possible in today's Web3 repository. Through innovative technologies (NFT platforms, currency exchange, and wallet providers) in tandem with people-powered initiatives, Web3 is blossoming into a system of efficiently solving the problem found in centralized systems. Allowing self-sovereign identities their right for communication, privacy, and governance, but that doesn't come without its obstacles.\n\n**Objective / Disclaimer**\n\nWeb3 is unfolding into new territories daily, building communities to find each other, holding themselves accountable towards the same mission and connecting with others. As a disclaimer to you reading this post, I am not an expert. I am naturally a researcher and enthusiast of the possibilities behind Web3 and decentralized narratives. I hope that by the time you finish reading this, you feel more familiar with Web3 and how decentralization plays a crucial role in facilitating the new narratives of what the internet was always meant to serve. I also strongly encourage everyone to always do as a motto states and \"Do your own research\" (DYOR) as a practice.\n\n**Pre-requisite**\n\nLet's start with Web1, which started around the early 90s, a version of the internet that was a space where consumers were primarily users on an open network of information (the read-only era). What Web1 had was many barriers to entry because of how technical the user experience was, which excluded the majority from using the internet. Leading us into the Web2 age, the centralization age came in with fewer barriers to entry due to big tech platforms such as Yahoo and Google who provided us with excellent user experience interfaces. This grew the consumer demand at scale. Most of us use this version today, where the primary focus is targeted advertisements and lack of privacy heralded by the arrival of social media. The Web2 internet we know today has needed the reliance on centralized intermediaries (Google, Meta, Amazon).\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nThe main principle of Web3 is decentralization. Rather than being controlled by Big Tech, governments, financial institutions, or large corporations, it's entirely run by a community of individuals seeking to make a difference to combat our current Web2 form. This Web2 form has been governed by addictive, abrasive, and controlling narratives that I believe users are fed up with. Now, the technology underpinning Web3 makes it possible for far more inventive open-source and decentralized systems to be created — and enables decentralized economies (based on Blockchain systems that incentivize the stakeholders, developers, contributors, and consumers alike) to form around them. When this happens successfully will enable the products and services of Web3 to compete with and eventually surpass those of Web2.\n\n**Opportunity**\n\nCreatives now have an opportunity to leverage this technology and set it up to become a significant driver of economic growth. This can alter the workforce economy into new realms of possibility to significantly impact how we operate as a society (think about how DAOs, NFTs, and the Metaverse can help play this out?!). This is where I find the most utopic possibility in Web3, where the creator economy and the workforce collide. Bringing artists, lawyers, developers, and creators together from around the globe to create ideas and monetize them globally in permissionless crypto-economic systems— and essentially defining the future of work.\n\n**Value Creation**\n\nIdeas and community contributions of working toward a shared goal that gains value over time (through individuals who feed that value creation) are gaining momentum in various social communities (Friends with benefits, Forefront, and Party DAO). A concept that results in an ecosystem of equity that doesn't exclude the niche. The governing principle behind Web 3 takes us back to the idea we spoke about at the start of this post around Web1 which was the first version of open-source visions, so we are right back where we started. In a space filled with skeptics, naysayers, and the uninterested, my advice to you is to find where your area is in Web3 and begin to implement the change you want to see in the future. This isn't going anywhere, nor is it a hoax— It's the early stages of something completely new and has the potential to be shaped by the right set of values.\n\n**Here a list of some fun places to start:**\n\n* <https://decentraland.org/>\n* <https://rabbithole.gg/>\n* <https://rally.io/>\n* <https://mirror.xyz/>\n* <https://dune.com/home>\n* <https://www.radardao.xyz/>\n* <https://chain.link/>\n* <https://forefront.market/feed>\n* <https://www.fwb.help/>\n* <https://party.mirror.xyz/>\n* <https://gitcoin.co/>\n* <https://flamingodao.xyz/>\n* <https://snapshot.org/#/>\n* <https://rabbithole.gg/>\n\nImage Credit: Vinicius Costa", "timestamp": 1658278778, "digest": "tcg278vcmkUq-1bzAZ7uTd5iSRWs3WlDqXN-p3B5RHQ", "contributor": "0xF1F144271438B53c38Bc502D804878D7b295e563"}

{"id": "MEvvpfcIdxAA5F5W7mkwgYY6-mXysk8o712s2At35sY", "title": "Milady Poem", "body": "There was a really bad month where Tomaszo stayed up late after his wife went to bed every night. He would listen to podcasts and play a skateboarding video game. He often used a cell phone application called Twitter to view and recommend to others a diverse array of ironic, cynical, sarcastically violent, earnestly violent, and/or politically extreme media that leveraged characters and stylistic themes/imagery from Japanese animation, low-resolution still shots and promotional material from outdated computer games, and assorted iconography, turns of phrase, and/or images appropriated from disparate internet communities of which he was sometimes a member and sometimes an outsider. But he also used the cell phone application to communicate his earnest thoughts and feelings so that people on the internet could console him in his paranoid schizophrenia or talk him down during bad episodes of autism.\n\nHe tweeted about how he felt this strange detachment and someone sent him a Twitter dm saying he was probably having a dissociative episode and that even though it happens to people sometimes, he shouldn’t tweet about it, because of how employers and family and whoever else can see his tweets and might do something that would make his life worse, like send him to a psychiatric hospital or prevent him from getting a different job. He thanked the person, deleted the tweet, and read most of the “dissociative disorder” article on Wikipedia.\n\nHe unpaused the skateboarding game. He dissociated some more. He had a hard time playing the game but liked having a word for what was happening. He paused the game. He looked at Twitter. He saw a brand entity icon account, @milady, post a joke about video games. Tomaszo replied to the @Milady account with a funny joke death threat. The @milady account was verified on Twitter. Tomaszo looked up how to be verified on Twitter. The verification process required a photo identification and filling out bureaucratic-seeming forms; it didn’t seem to make any sense for a brand to be verified on Twitter. Tomaszo deleted his death threat because he knew it was low-value, violent speech that wasn’t protectable under the First Amendment. Tomaszo then tweeted at the @milady account to ask if it had photo identification. The @milady account quote-tweeted Tomaszo’s tweet alongside a photo of a man being stabbed in the neck. The picture seemed real and was exceptionally graphic. There was blood and the beginnings of a gaping wound. The @milady account called Tomaszo a dumb piece of shit in the quote-tweet. Tomaszo liked the threatening and violent tweet out of a vague hope that it would defuse things. He unpaused his skateboarding game and worriedly played for seventeen minutes.\n\nHe paused the game and checked Twitter and saw that the @milady account’s quote-tweet had been deleted. The @milady account had tweeted an apology about being hacked. The apology had several thousand likes. Tomaszo received a dm from the @milady account. The @milady account called him a *little bitch.* The @milady account sent another dm calling him a *fucking narc*. The @milady account sent another dm with a picture of the man being stabbed in the neck. It looked like the same man from the first photo being stabbed for a second time.

When the two children were young, they watched the children for me, the old lady worked in the fields, and I often took the children to help. I deal with the elderly every day, and have established a very close relationship between day and night. I am fortunate to have learned important life lessons from the elderly while living happily.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uNCYYhvelt3Jvq4eJHXTH.png?height=270&width=415)\n\nAlways fill the bowl and return it\n\nThe old landlord, the old man, broke down two years ago, and now he lives in a nursing home. The old lady is the only one left at home. Thinking that it is inconvenient for the old man to be alone, I have to give a bowl of delicious food to the old lady. The old lady always accepted it happily. Two days later, she came to the door and returned the bowl to thank it. The bowl was always full. Sometimes it's the blueberries she harvests, sometimes it's chocolate for the kids, sometimes it's two snacks, but she never returns an empty bowl. The old lady never talked about her philosophy of life, but she told me with her actions: it is not enough to accept the benefits of others, and it is not enough to say thanks with your mouth, you must return it in kind, even if it is a small thing that is not valuabl\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7laxPH1vEuvkw_r26bsE3.png?height=273&width=409)\n\ne.\n\nToday's affairs will never be postponed until tomorrow\n\nEver since I met the old lady landlord, I thought she was very busy. As many people come to her every day, there are as many things to do, so whenever something in the house breaks and needs to be repaired, I am embarrassed. But as long as I mustered up the courage to speak, the old lady immediately put down what she was doing, and immediately contacted me to fix it. No matter how troublesome, no matter how much it costs, the old lady never procrastinates. Maybe she knew that feeling distressed for the current little money, or putting the problem aside for a while, would only make things worse. Unpleasant things have to be resolved immediately, the longer the delay, the harder it is to do.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IMYRuL07jaMTvESzIWJJG.png?height=270&width=417)\n\nLive and learnIn Japanese Shinto, the green leaves of the camellia family are used for decoration. The old couple planted a lot of these trees back then, and the leaves sold better than the flowers. Although this kind of business has long been discontinued, some shrines still like to ask for his family due to the good reputation they have accumulated in the past. The old lady took the call from the shrine and went to the mountain to chop branches, and then brought them back with a small truck to trim them in her garage. The old lady felt that it was a waste of time to do this work for several hours. So, she bought a CD that reads Japanese classical literature aloud and listened to it while pruning branches. Our whole family was shocked when the soft female voice echoed in the garage for the first time. The old lady who graduated from junior high school has been doing farm work all her life, and has been a big landowner for most of her life. She has a million-dollar family property. Nearly 80 years old, she is still doing farm work in the garage while listening to classical literature recitations. Continuing to learn will not make her richer, but it will make her more spiritual.", "timestamp": 1658280021, "digest": "J7h4gpaMbld9wQbZS7lMUG2winwKuAw4KbWTDRJxMy0", "contributor": "0x14bd6177124529E8409993fBf08DDB0702695730"}
{"id": "NaQvfrDkXswSt-ajwXTHI5NcOis2JfvyNO5ZsJFl0i0", "title": "I am a little goldfish", "body": "I am a little goldfish. If you really want to know how small it is, it may only be five centimeters with a ruler. I don't know where I came from, let alone what my mother looked like. For as long as I can remember, I have lived in a transparent glass tank with goldfish of various sizes and colors. The man who has passed the age of confusion sprinkles some fine powdery things into the fish tank every day. We all know that it is food. This is not because our noses are sensitive enough, but experience and habits tell us. We, in addition to eating, will never have any other surprises. At this moment, my companions and I opened our mouths and swam towards the food with lightning speed. Everyone has to go all out to try to eat more, because if we didn't eat today, we have to wait until tomorrow, which is too long for our stomachs. I don't know who spread the public opinion that goldfish can only be eaten once a day, and only a small amount, otherwise it will die. Alas, no communication is really scary. These grotesque antics always starve us, so we scrambled for less than 10 seconds. It is said that human beings cannot afford to hurt because of money, then our goldfish destroys harmony because of food.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c6ATycOZw_E421crU1QH0.png?height=266&width=435)\n\nWe had a leisurely life, but we had no bigger places to go, and I often longed for vast freedoms. If possible, I would like to fight for freedom. The funny thing is that although we are weak, we cannot find a strong enemy.\n\nEvery day when I see pedestrians hurried by, I have such a show of self-comfort in my heart: Although I don't have the freedom of your human beings, I have free food to eat, don't worry about where to live. At this time, I can finally find a sense of superiority in being a goldfish. Of course, if anyone disdains my sense of superiority, it means that you haven't realized the difficulty of this accommodation. Go and watch the BBC documentary, after watching it, you will know how difficult it is to have a meal these days, and how difficult it is to have a nest.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wpiEjr1rfcAncfNIV5eaL.png?height=266&width=450)\n\nI look happy every day, but I also have my own sadness. Every time I see my companions who have lived and played together leave, no one can see the sadness in my eyes, at least I know that humans are invisible, because they all leave with undisguised joy. But slowly I also accepted this separation, the old companion left, the new companion came, and so on. To be honest, when those goldfish were taken away one by one, in addition to being sad, I also flashed some despicable joy, but fortunately I ran fast and was not caught.\n\nThe days are just like this, when I eat comfortably and swim freely every day, it slips away quietly. One day when I was wandering around, I suddenly found that there were fewer and fewer goldfishes I was familiar with, and I realized that I had been in this fish tank for more than half a year. I suddenly wondered what life was going on for the goldfish that was taken away? And why did you stay here for so long? Is it a lucky escape every time, or are those people who don't want to take me away because I'm not pretty? I always thought it was the former. OMG! Am I not pretty? I never thought about this question. I immediately turned around a few times, and the surroundings were transparent, so I couldn't see myself. If it's really because I'm ugly that I've been kept here forever, then the joy of every escape before has become the biggest irony now.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9ylFc5S7PL5blZwZEFTGH.png?height=279&width=448)\n\nWhen someone came to pick goldfish again, I swam hard and jumped up happily. Once I was finally lucky enough to be caught, only to be brushed down mercilessly, and I was embarrassed at the time. After being eliminated again and again, I realized that I am an ornamental goldfish. My value is that humans bring me home, and when they see me, they are pleasant to the eyes and in a good mood. I hate myself for not thinking about this before.\n\nIt seems that my appearance has no advantage, and I am trapped in a pile of fish. Everyone has their own characteristics. How can I leave this place and reflect my value? I realized I couldn't stay here for comfort anymore, because no one would ever appreciate me here. To think of new places to go, I have to put in more effort than any other goldfish.\n\nTo say that in the past, I was swimming lazily, but now I am swimming happily. I want to find my strengths, I don't have a good appearance, but I want to have a healthy body. Slowly I found myself with a new skill, and that is when I hold my head up and blow bubbles with my head up, my mouth can make a loud noise, I think the strings of bubbles are matched with This voice should make me look spirited and cute. This is something that other goldfish can't do, and I snickered. Waiting quietly for the arrival of the new owner.\n\nBut a few days later, I'm still here.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hqPccJ0VqSIi9NmPpW583.png?height=279&width=448)\n\nAt this moment, a mother and a five-year-old boy came to the fish tank. The mother lets her child choose their favorite goldfish. I looked at this little boy: white skin, smooth and full forehead, big eyes focused and focused, the yellow shirt and blue plaid shorts made him more beautiful and cute. I fell in love with him right away and swam to the front without hesitation. The little boy looked left and right, not knowing which one to choose. I knew it was time to give full play to my special talents. Sure enough, the little boy picked me up decisively after seeing my performance. Maybe he was too excited. When I was just picked up, his hand shook and I was thrown to the ground mercilessly. After I got out of the water and fell, I couldn't breathe like I had asthma, and I was dying on the ground. Fortunately, the little boy picked me up immediately and put me in the water bag that the man had already prepared. I took a deep breath, and I never thought the water tasted so good. At this time, the child's mother said: \"No, I just fell to the ground, and I'm sure it won't last long. Let's pick another one!\" The little boy said: No, I want this one, who said it wouldn't live long, look how well it swims! You can blow bubbles when you fall on the ground!", "timestamp": 1658280562, "digest": "lDsj-MUk8ucck5a_PAdkXGWQbEbttU4_CB4q9OrSJxM", "contributor": "0x14bd6177124529E8409993fBf08DDB0702695730"}

{"id": "D3eQYnlQiTD6Pwt0yqhaKa0LaOZ59SI-FWcD7FFUJ30", "title": "Ability to manage emotions", "body": "There is such a young man who is irritable by nature and has difficulty controlling his emotions. His old father asked his son that if he could not control his emotions in the future, he would fix a nail on the wall in the backyard and wait for his emotions to stabilize. Pull the nail out again. So the young man followed his father's instructions. At first, he even set 30 nails a day, but every time the young man pulled out the nails, he deeply felt that the process of pulling out the nails required more effort than the act of setting the nails. Several times, so, the guy slowly began to reduce the chance of nailing, gradually, from 30 nails per day to 15, until he stopped going to the backyard to set nails for several days. Later, the old father brought the young man to the backyard and pointed to the wall board that was full of savage people. When he was out of control, the words he said were like putting nails in the heart. Even if the nails were pulled out, the scars would still be hard to recover.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QskrKJK5WtLCJvdzFJSq6.png?height=282&width=453)\n\nI vaguely remember that the story was described in this way. It is fortunate that the young man has such a wise old father, who can use such a vivid method to let his son realize the true meaning of it. Thankfully again, I saw a story that made me and the guy in the story feel the importance of emotional management. If you are angry for one minute, you will lose 60 seconds of your happy life; what you say and do when you lose your mind will make you regret immediately; a high education is a threshold for you to enter the workplace, but high emotional intelligence can help you do well in the workplace . And so on similar words are all telling us that emotional management it is important.\n\nYour ability to manage emotions is actually the quotient of your emotional management, commonly known as emotional intelligence. Expert research has pointed out that the difference between EQ and IQ is that a large part of IQ comes from heredity, and there is little chance of acquired change, but EQ can be improved through the guidance and efforts of others, so there is so much management. Learn from experts to study emotion management, and there are so many people who are looking forward to success in emotion management who don’t hesitate to take a related course.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lkeq7n9p26iXtmy6iJw48.png?height=270&width=412)\n\nSo based on the improvement of my emotional management ability, I have consulted quite a few books, and now I will share with you what I have gained.\n\nEnter the word \"emotion\" into Baidu, and there is such an explanation \"it is a reaction to the environment\". Faced with the same environment, such as a rainy day, different people will have different emotional experiences: those who meet to go out to play will feel disappointed, and farmers who are worried that the drought will affect their harvest will feel lucky. The key to different reactions is that people are different, so emotions are actually just a subjective reaction of people to the internal and external environment. Many times, the uncomfortable physiological reactions that emotions bring to us and the adverse consequences of their actions will make us feel that some emotions are bad. Yes, it is not. Emotions are neither good or bad, but a subjective reaction of us.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ogTUAbxRVOhUE-8K8spy7.png?height=276&width=442)\n\nBy analogy, it is not difficult to see from the definition of emotional management \"the management of your own reactions to the environment\" that the key to good emotional management lies in yourself, because it is a management of your own reactions, so It is said that you have 100% control over emotional management, and it depends on you, not on others. Many times, we often hear someone complaining after losing control of their emotions, \"If it wasn't for his attitude, I wouldn't have such impulsive actions.\" In fact, this sentence is just to find a reason for our loss of control. The remote control of management has always been in our own hands. Once you have a request for the response of the other party, you will unconditionally hand over the remote control of your emotions to the other party, so it is inevitable to lose control.\n\nThe colorful colors are derived from the three primary colors of red, green and blue. Although there are hundreds of expressions of emotions, they can be summarized into four basic emotions: joy, anger, sorrow, and fear.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cb94OE6aGjZbFDKfMh7v1.png?height=289&width=303)\n\nJoy and sadness are a pair of opposite emotions. When people achieve their desired goals and relieve tension and anxiety, the feeling of comfort is the emotional experience of joy; sadness is the emotional experience after the loss of the desired goal. Anger and fear are another pair of opposing emotions; usually when a person encounters an unpleasant thing, our autonomic nervous system will produce a flight or fight response, and when the opponent we encounter is stronger than us, we will take flight. , which is the emotional experience of fear; and when the other party is weaker than us, we will have war, which is the emotional experience of anger. Taking cats and mice as an example, an adult cat has 500 experience points for catching mice, and a weak mouse has 50 experience points against cats, so such a cat will immediately take an offensive stance; another cat has 100 experience points to fight against a cat. The mouse experience value is 150, then the cat may choose to avoid it; there is another cat with 300 experience value, and the mouse experience value of the battle is 250, then we will see the cat keep slapping the mouse with its paws , keep slapping until the mouse escapes without panting before attacking and winning. In our opinion, the third cat is playing with the mouse. If the third cat is injected with a tranquilizer, then this 300 experience is worth the cat will immediately Attack the mouse with 250 experience points, because the cat is slapping like this because it's scared. This is also understandable why drivers tend to lose control of their tempers. They can yell and make insulting gestures in the car when the traffic is not smooth. In fact, this is because people feel safe and fearless in the car, regardless of the situation.

Founder Anthony Scaramucci confirmed the move July 19 in an interview on CNBC, after Bloomberg reported it a day earlier citing anonymous sources. \n\n“Our board made the decision to temporarily suspend until we can raise capital inside the fund,” Scaramucci told CNBC. “The fund is unlevered, so there’s definitely no fear of any liquidation whatsoever and about 18% of the fund is in what we would call crypto exposure.” An independent board also took art in the decision, Scaramucci said.\n\nScaramucci mentioned Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) and FTX stock as examples of the fund’s crypto exposure. Among other crypto-related companies listed as investments on the Skybridge website, not specifically linked to Legion Strategies, are Kraken, NYDIG, Helium, Lightning and Genesis Digital Assets. Scaramucci said the Legion Strategies fund was down 30% year-to-date, but up 5% in July.\n\nLegion Strategies is an offshore fund based in the Cayman Islands that has about $250 million in it, according to Scaramucci. It is one of the smaller funds run by the company. This was the first time the fund had been suspended since its founding in 1994. Skybridge itself was founded in 2005.\n\nScaramucci told CNBC:\n\n> “Everybody signed an investor agreement, this type of flexibility, so I don’t think there are any surprises here given what’s going on in the overall market.”\n\nSkybridge is among the financial services companies that have [applied to list a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-rejects-skybridge-s-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf)and been rejected by the United Sates Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n***Related: [Scaramucci sees bright future for crypto but ‘very worried’ about US politicians](https://cointelegraph.com/news/scaramucci-sees-bright-future-for-crypto-but-very-worried-about-us-politicians)***\n\nSkybridge made its first investments in Bitcoin in late 2020 and announced in April that [it was repositioning itself](https://cointelegraph.com/news/skybridge-goes-all-in-on-crypto-betting-on-tremendous-growth-ahead) to “eventually be a leading cryptocurrency asset manager and adviser.”", "timestamp": 1658282254, "digest": "vNtp_nUr4E5dFGfYZAI2t3ExiJpkGJMPzbrVNetiXnY", "contributor": "0x43BB172927116E0E5713A957A581E621762AEe2C"}

Under Bian Que's meticulous care, their illnesses recovered in no time. However, Bian Que said to Gong Hu and Qi Ying, \"The diseases you both sought to treat in the past were caused by the intrusion of pathogens from outside the body into the internal organs, so only medicine and acupuncture can solve the problem. God, I found out that there is still a disease lurking in you. It was brought out of your mother's womb and grew along with your body's development. This disease is very dangerous. I would like to treat you again, how about it?\"\nGong Hu and Qi Ying replied, \"We want to hear about the symptoms of this disease, and then make a decision.\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/22Axqee-imUpjpraoVcpN.png?height=270&width=232)\n\n\nTherefore, Bian Que first said to Gong Hu: \"You have lofty ambitions, and you are good at thinking about problems. You can have many ways to deal with problems, but unfortunately, your temperament is relatively weak, and you are often indecisive, hesitant, and lost at critical moments. Good opportunity.\" Then, he turned to Qi Ying: \"What about you? It's the exact opposite of Gong Hu. You lack long-term plans for the future, your thoughts are relatively simple, but your temperament is very strong, and you don't think much about others, but you like to act arbitrarily. Finally, Bian Que said to the two of them: \"Now if I exchange your hearts, you will all be perfect.\"\nAfter listening to Bian Que's analysis, Gong Hu and Qi Ying were both willing to undergo a heart transplant. So, Bian Que made them both drink a kind of narcotic wine, causing them to fall into a coma and not wake up for three days. During this time, Bian Que opened their chests, took out their hearts, and exchanged them. After the operation, the magic medicine was applied to the wound, and when they recovered, they were still as healthy and strong as before the operation. After they said goodbye to Bian Que together, they went home separately.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Ei0IzueyAUdja31wQY50.png?height=276&width=330)\n\n\nHowever, because the hearts have been exchanged, Gong Hu returned to Qi Ying's house, and Qi Ying returned to Gong Hu's house. The wives and children of the two families did not know the people who came home, so they all quarreled. Gong Hu and Qi Ying couldn't think of it, so they had to ask Bian Que to explain. Bian Que told the two families the whole story, so that the quarrel could be put to rest.\nThis fable is borrowing the name of the genius doctor Bian Que, using the metaphor of heart-changing, to show that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.

Persistence 团队将与 Keplr、Cosmostation、Coin98 和 Citadel 等钱包团队通力合作，以确保 Persistence Core-1 链的新用户仅注册到代币类型 118。 \n\n   b. 我们将为现有用户提供接口，方便现有用户在与应用和链的交互中继续使用代币类型 750，直到用户迁移到代币类型 118。\n\n   c. 进行与代币类型以及迁移至 118 相关的推广教育。\n2. 在用户端进行从代币类型 750 至代币类型 118 的迁移：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZIB4wp7h9J0mYv3AWhEJh.png?height=813&width=2048)\n\n1. 新用户：无需任何操作 \n2. 现有网页端/手机端钱包用户： \n\n   \\-代币类型118用户：无需操作 \n\n   \\-代币类型750用户：创建一个新钱包并将您的代币迁移到新创建的钱包中 \n3. Ledger 用户：迁移到 Cosmos 应用程序 -代币类型118 \n4. 质押 XPRT 的用户： \n\n   \\-迁移建议：在 Iqlusion 上线流动性质押模块后（暂定2022年第三季度末），无需解除质押即可直接将质押代币转移至新的代币类型118钱包地址。 \n\n   \\-即时解决方案：将您的 XPRT 解除质押并迁移到新创建的代币类型 118 钱包地址。\n\n将代币类型从 750 迁移至 118 的提案一旦通过，在接下来的几个月的迁移期内，团队保证将为无缝迁移提供全部必要的支持及指导。 \n\n同时，Persistence钱包以及合作钱包还将在未来很长一段时间内支持代币类型750，以确保全部用户都顺利迁移至代币类型118。 \n\n**注意:** 我们预计将在2024年12月不再支持代币类型750的钱包。 \n\n代币类型迁移的核心目的是为 Persistence 生态系统成员提供最佳用户体验。随着项目的成熟，我们一直在不断努力提供以用户为核心的产品，而这需要我们不断的进行迭代发展。 \n\n只有在社区、验证者和合作项目的不断反馈、支持和通力合作之下，我们才能实现预定的目标。我们朝着更佳的用户体验前进的每一步都将让我们离成为 PoS 生态系统的流动性质押中心这一目标更进一步。\n\n## 拓展参考资料：\n\n* 衍生路径: <https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/derivation-paths> \n* BIP44 标准: <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki>\n* 代币类型 118: <https://medium.com/chainapsis/keplr-explained-coin-type-118-9781d26b2c4e>\n* IBC 信息面板: <https://mapofzones.com>\n\n**P.S.** 感谢 Chainapsis 团队对代币类型 118 的研究，辅助构建了本篇文章以及相关的关键信息。", "timestamp": 1658282126, "digest": "FtJOMT-OpDk_Gn7rm2_BGoiziJ8qGEvcg8vCcFCXezQ", "contributor": "0xd92b5bd0048dc13469FBE17EdE75Aa5AA91f9296"}

Founder Anthony Scaramucci confirmed the move July 19 in an interview on CNBC, after Bloomberg reported it a day earlier citing anonymous sources. \n\n“Our board made the decision to temporarily suspend until we can raise capital inside the fund,” Scaramucci told CNBC. “The fund is unlevered, so there’s definitely no fear of any liquidation whatsoever and about 18% of the fund is in what we would call crypto exposure.” An independent board also took art in the decision, Scaramucci said.\n\nScaramucci mentioned Bitcoin ([BTC](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price)) and FTX stock as examples of the fund’s crypto exposure. Among other crypto-related companies listed as investments on the Skybridge website, not specifically linked to Legion Strategies, are Kraken, NYDIG, Helium, Lightning and Genesis Digital Assets.

{"id": "aojIGZXGkuXmsUIya87m0KJHBMJZUAAZHxwwrnq0ycE", "title": "One tree becomes wood, ten trees become firewood", "body": "In the early 1890s, in Houston, the southern United States, the cotton billionaire William Marshall Rice donated money to establish Rice University, which is one of the earliest private schools in the United States.\n\nWhen the campus was built, Rice stipulated that not a single oak tree on the original site should be moved, and it should be carefully fortified. From the construction of the school to the completion of the school, there are no less oak trees, a total of 689 trees.\n\nAs a result, the school recruited 689 students in the first year.\n\nPeople don't understand. Some people say that Rice has a problem with nerves, because according to the size of the school, it can recruit at least 1,000 students. Private schools, on the other hand, are supported by tuition fees, and there is no difference between a teacher teaching 50 students and 100 students.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9ixZCSeEK4PkrlzE7hSZ0.png?height=270&width=367)\n\nRice continued to ask teachers and students to cultivate oak trees and new oak trees in sections until the campus was \"saturated\". If oak trees are in the way of infrastructure land, oak trees must be transplanted to another part of the campus at any cost, and they must be guaranteed to survive, or enrollment must be reduced accordingly the following year.\n\nIf the enrollment plan for the next year increases, the first thing the school has to do is to plant a corresponding number of oak trees. If unfortunately some do not survive, a corresponding number of students will be unlucky.\n\nAt this time, some people seem to have realized something, while more people are more puzzled, and some people even say that Rice may be an \"oak spirit\".\n\nBy 1902, the campus was finally \"saturated\" with 4,890 oak trees. At this time, Rice, who was seriously ill, made a rule: no matter when, the number of students in the school should not exceed 4,890.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YaSY-tY4jLnOHKz3fw0xD.png?height=270&width=405)\n\nAfter his death, people saw that Rice University became famous and became \"Harvard in the South of the United States\", and people erected a statue for him, \"the supreme pioneer of American private schools\".\n\nUntil 2008, there were 4,890 lush oak trees on the 325-hectare campus, and the total number of students in the school was 4,850, slightly less than the total number of oaks. In public schools, the 325-hectare campus has at least 9,000 students.\n\nMore than 100 years later, no matter how the times change, no matter how the economy develops, the number of students at Rice University is always less than the number of oak trees. There has been no question or objection to Mr Rice's rule.\n\nIn fact, the reason is very simple. Of course, the results of growing one tree in one square meter and growing 10 trees in one square meter are different: one tree becomes wood, and 10 trees become firewood. Regarding the possibility of personalized education for teachers on stage, the teaching effect of a classroom with 20 students and 50 students is of course different.\n\nIt's a simple truth, but there are always too many people who can't imitate it - the truth is also very simple: it is caused by the desire for profit.\n\nRice University only restricts the number of students. For world-class experts and scholars who are interested in teaching, it not only refuses to come, but also takes the initiative to throw \"hydrangea\" to them. The total number of students is less than 5,000, but the total number of teachers exceeds 500, and the teacher-to-student ratio is greater than 1:10.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qV0muijlmghrsjc_6aDcH.png?height=270&width=289)\n\nIn the 2007 U.S. university rankings, from the 1st to the 21st place are all private universities, and only from the 22nd place are public universities. At No. 22 is the public University of California, Berkeley, which is also far from No. 21 in strength.\n\nAccording to the 2010 National University Rankings, Rice University ranked 17th. It is a public university with its close proximity to the University of Texas, but it cannot be compared with Rice University in terms of academic level.\n\nThere are many unchangeable laws in nature.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GUBssrs47m64OD9vU5Bta.png?height=270&width=342)\n\nOn the same piece of land, the oak trees that can thrive are limited, and the number of students a university can accommodate is also limited, breaking the harmony between students, teachers and school-running conditions, the decline of teaching quality and the decline of school reputation will inevitably, eventually It affects the long-term development of the school. In fact, Rice University takes the oak tree as its teacher and follows the objective laws of nature, and longevity is inevitable.", "timestamp": 1658282430, "digest": "rkCNwyrKyi73AXZFqBlVZf8euVFYmAs-RuK0qezFWYU", "contributor": "0x14bd6177124529E8409993fBf08DDB0702695730"}

He has a stable job, but also has his parents who love him. He does not worry about food, clothing, or lack of love. However, he always felt that he had endless troubles, entangled in his heart, unable to break free or escape.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/k__liI4CFCrXxRi4cKhrI.png?height=270&width=376)\n\nHow can people be so troubled? Young people are confused. One day, when he met a wise man, he expressed the confusion in his heart, hoping to get enlightenment.\n\nAfter listening to the wise man, he smiled slightly and said, \"The secular world, the wine pond and the meat forest, the human dance in the red dust, the famous locks and the locks, everything is tempting and confusing people. If you want to move, you will be excited, and you will naturally be troubled. Gains and losses, glory and shame, ups and downs... The more you care, the more painful your heart will be; on the contrary, the more you give up, the more peaceful your heart will be. \"Let go\" is to eliminate the root cause of troubles.\n\nThe young man nodded, if he understood something.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BQEGTouCkjVSpp5KsQMFZ.png?height=286&width=460)\n\nAnother day, he met a philanthropist. It is said that the philanthropist once made a lot of money, but then donated the money to others. Now, he lives happily.\n\nThe young man told the philanthropist his confusion again, hoping to get an answer from him.\n\nThe philanthropist said, I have had the same pain as you. However, since I learned to pay attention to others and to love others, the pain in my heart disappeared. Love is really an oar given to us by God, it can ferry us beyond the sea of ​​misery.\n\nA selfish person will not get great pleasures in life. Only those who have love in their hearts can create ripples of infinite happiness in the echo of love. Sharing the pain of others can also relieve your own pain; showing your own warmth will also receive the warm gift of others. This is the magical power of love.\n\nYes, troubles, more often, are the result of selfishness. When a person has others in his heart and loves others, troubles will be lessened.\n\nThe words of a philanthropist make young people feel like they can see the sun through the clouds.\n\nOnce again, the unit organized a trip, and the young man saw an old woman pounding rice in a farm household. While pounding rice, she hummed a folk song. Looks very happy.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/StyiONxVh7g7jmObGno-W.png?height=270&width=390)\n\nHe also shared his confusion to the old woman, hoping to get a different answer from her.\n\ntrouble? The old woman frowned and looked at the young man and said, \"I have been working from morning to night. I have been busy all my life. As long as I am working, I am singing and I am happy. I don't have time to worry.\n\nThe old woman paused and said to herself, maybe, only people who are free will be troubled.\n\nThinking of the words of wise men and philanthropists in the past, at that moment, young people suddenly became enlightened: It turned out that this world, unable to let go, no love in the heart, and boredom, will all be the source of troubles, and no matter what it is, it will become a spiritual source. The quagmire makes a person miserable.\n\nWhen the young man understands this, it is natural that he also finds a happy direction in life.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ejh5Am_Vk7xkCf5EakrzE.png?height=274&width=441)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658282704, "digest": "uaJF57WgpX1RvEESePVFSqQ_uC9KZ4Rhlq5Tb0RjAoA", "contributor": "0x14bd6177124529E8409993fBf08DDB0702695730"}

{"id": "MZaN6pIGtbrqN336Na6QGRDuDz4Eyz7rxYJmx2OQFxo", "title": "#Winning", "body": "This week I had planned to write on the topic of doxing, or more specifically, about the question of “to dox or not to dox”, and the choice for, or against, web3 anonymity. As inspired as I initially felt to explore it, once I sat down to outline it the work began to feel like a grind. Then, as I often do these days when feeling stuck, I turned my attention to twitter for a daily download of crypto news and DAOist musings. Somewhere in my feed, from someone I had never heard of, there appeared the following,\n\n“You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.\nThat’s why every quarter, I evaluate myself and my friends on 3 key criteria:\n\n* Income\n* Fitness\n* Influence\n\nAnyone who scores below me is cut off.\nComplacency is the first step towards mediocrity.”\n\nA day later, though I don’t recall all the details of my reaction, I think it a safe bet it included some combination of a furrowed brow, my best [gas face](https://slangdefine.org/g/gas-face-13ec.html) and nausea.  All of that before I fired back with the first thing to come to mind as a counter blow.\n\n“Congratulations on a life devoid of either giving or receiving unconditional love. You’re winning though. 👊”\n\n[https://twitter.com/HAshBrown_27/status/1548437771974348801?s=20&t=4QqD9qeeewCOpN7zYUJ16g](https://twitter.com/HAshBrown_27/status/1548437771974348801?s=20&t=4QqD9qeeewCOpN7zYUJ16g)\n\nSoon after that I turned off my computer and went out for the day. Honestly, I don’t think it occurred to me that I would even look at the tweet again. To the contrary, as someone new to twitter this year, I expected my response would go largely ignored, joining my 20-or-so other tweets in the land of twitter oblivion. To my surprise though, when I returned home several hours later, I noticed my twitter notification bell ringing, alerting me to the fact that my response had close to 200 likes. 20 hours later that number is now up to 488. Not that I’m counting.\n\nI’m new to this twitter thing, and as far as “likes” are concerned, have only facebook likes of posts of my kids, mountain views and fishing pictures to compare it to. 488 likes seems like a lot though. So while it may be small potatoes to seasoned tweeters with big followings, I’m a babe in the woods here, feeling pretty proud of that 488 thank you very much. Ooh, lookie there, just shot past 500. Am I going viral? LFG!!!\n\nSeriously though, upon looking into the phenomena of my most-liked social media entry ever, I see the person I responded to has a lot of followers. 6,075 to be exact. And digging a little deeper I realize he likely intended his tweet as satire. Gas face rescinded. Perhaps the joke is on me for responding to it.\n\nSatire or not, and irrespective of whether his friendship circles have anything to do with crypto and Web3, [@_mihir](https://twitter.com/__mihir?s=20&t=iOpvhasWZtEkPYiiXfkDYw) points to something very concerning to me about Web3 culture and the playing field of web3 identity. Playas gonna play. So how will Web3 define winning?\n\nBefore we get into all that I sense some context would be helpful.  A man in my early 50’s, I am at most a social media dabbler. I have a facebook page that I post on occasionally and to keep up with the lives of my 926 friends. I have created a few blogs over the years that I have enjoyed writing on but never broadcasted. Instagram? Ohhh hellll no….except to check in on the lives of my college-age children. I regard the notion of creating a web “identity” as near hostile to my bias for real-life interaction with others and time outdoors. And other than a short list of physical ailments, I can’t think of anything I’d like less than “followers”.\n\nSo what am I doing here worrying and writing about Web3 culture?  Fair question. What can I say except [orange pills](https://ryanslot.substack.com/p/what-it-means-to-be-orange-pilled#details) are a thing. [Green pills](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylewestaway/2022/06/16/how-crypto-can-regenerate-the-world/?sh=7ed83b602fd3) too. I’ve fallen down a [crypto rabbit hole](https://garywoodfine.com/going-down-the-crypto-rabbit-hole/) and I can’t get up!\n\nThe truth is that while I wrestle with mixed emotions about getting involved, I am thankful for crypto’s role in opening my mind (🤯) and luring me beyond my comfort zone.  For every horror story of greed, theft and exploitation related to this new frontier, I find most of what I read about the space to be inspiring.  To quote the immortal words of Buffalo Springfield, [“Somethings Happening Here”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQUj56sqicU), 2020’s style, and most days I want to be a part of it.\n\nOne example of this is an article, [“The Future of Work”](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-future-of-work), by David Hoffman. David makes a strong case for why Digital Organizations (DO’s), enabled by the blockchain and tokenized incentives, will present unprecedented opportunities for humans to coordinate both our hearts’ and minds’ shared interests to do purposeful work together.  Among the many lines to strike a chord with me David writes,\n\n“If you are a young person, looking for purpose, meaning, and eventually a salary, establishing yourself as a strong DOer is one of the best footholds you can establish for yourself….If you believe DOs are the future, you should start DOing now, so that you become the scarce resource for both DOs and people who need help DOing.”\n\nRelative to the audience David likely had in mind I am not a “young person”. That said, aside from a rather curmudgeonly attitude toward social media, I pride myself at being young in spirit. I am DOing (and DAOing) now and, in time, aspire to be among the scarce, most valued resources of the space. So what game am I playing? And what was it about @_mihir”s tweet that bothered me so?\n\nThough it has been over 20 years since I worked as an equity analyst at an investment brokerage firm, that work, and my short time in the industry, taught me some valuable lessons. The most memorable of them is the difference between the “game” of judging companies’ worth on the basis of quarterly performance vs. that of valuing them (or not) on the basis of fundamental strengths relative to longer-term investment horizons. The former game is played to generate transactions that pay brokers and their firms. The latter is played to maximize investors’ returns.\n\nWeb3 playing fields, DOs and DAOs included, will create whole new worlds from which to relate to the earth, token projects, and one another. There will be more games to go around than anyone can count in the space’s many arenas. Short-term trading, of crypto and people, can be fun, even profitable.

{"id": "naOam-pVShVNASvNBipFIBALEFGXfRWzEtZ_rCA94lg", "title": "秒杀黑洞的类星体，光芒贯穿半个宇宙，会撕裂银河系？", "body": "在我们的认知当中，黑洞应该可以被称得上是整个宇宙中最为危险的天体之一。**由于黑洞本身的质量极大，因此它可以产生几乎一种无法逆转的吸引力。**大型的黑洞甚至可以在一段时间内把一整个星系吞噬殆尽，甚至连光线也无法逃离黑洞的捕捉。\n\n但是在科学家们的研究过程中，人们逐渐发现了一种新的天体，这种天体相较于黑洞更为恐怖和神秘，它的名字就叫做**类星体**……\n\n### 宇宙中的类星体\n\n从类星体这个名字当中，**我们就可以看出这是一种与星体结构类似，但却并非是真正意义上“星”的天体。**\n\n简单来说，类星体的结构与我们认知当中的恒星极为类似，**但它们却在某些方面与恒星有着显著的区别**，它们并不像恒星一样可以将自身的物质和进行压缩成一个球形，**只是以一种近乎于缥缈的状态存在于宇宙当中。**\n\n而**类星体与恒星最为相似的地方，就是二者都能向外发射一种电波。**\n\n我们也可以**把这种电波称之为射电源，恒星与类星体发射的射电源，在宇宙当中可谓是极其常见**，我们每天都能通过射电望远镜观测到这种电波的存在。**而那些我们无法弄清来源的射电波，其实就是来自于类星体。**\n\n从这些描述当中，**我们能够看得出类星体是一种在宇宙当中极为特殊的存在**，但它的天体属性从单纯的描述来说无论怎样也称不上是恐怖，为什么天文学家们会对其感到畏惧呢？\n\n### 类星体的三大恐怖之处\n\n类星体的**第一大恐怖之处就是它的亮度**，2**015年，我国的天文工作者们发现了一个巨型的类星体**，这个类星体距离我们的地球足足有**128亿光年**的距离。\n\n按理来说，在这样遥远的距离之下，任何物质都是难以被观测到的。而天文学家们之所以能够轻而易举的发现类星体，就是因为它的亮度实在是太过惊人，**根据数据分析，该类星体的亮度可以达到太阳的420万亿倍。**\n\n**正因如此，我们才能够跨越100多亿光年的距离来对其进行观测。**\n\n科学家们还发现：**类星体在宇宙当中的红移值都很高**，也就是说，**它们与地球之间的距离其实是在不断被拉长的**。如果我们的地球距离一个类星体过近的话，很有可能会对地球上的人类产生重大的影响。\n\n类星体的**第二大恐怖之处就是其内部所蕴含的能量**，类星体的体型放在宇宙当中其实并不算大，一般都不会超过普通的星系，但是，**一个类星体内部所蕴藏的能量却要比普通的星系高上几千亿倍。**\n\n从很大程度上来说，**类星体之所以能够有如此大的能量效应，是因其超高的亮度。**\n\n如果我们把一块光伏电池板放置在距离类星体只有1亿公里的地方，**我们只需要从中接受一秒钟的光能，所接收到的能量总数就可以在理论上帮助人类的0.72级文明突破到二级文明。**\n\n但这样的想法终究无法实现，因为**类星体周边的能量物质运动太不稳定，如果真的把探测器送到离它这么近的位置，无疑是自寻死路。**\n\n类星体的**第三大恐怖之处是其违背物理学常识的运动速度。**“物质的运动速度无法超过光速”是物理学界一个不争的事实，但是**科学家们在观测类星体上的物质运动史，却发现其分离速度达到了288万公里/秒。**\n\n直到今天也没有人能够说清类星体内部如此剧烈的物质运动和超高的速度转换究竟是什么原因。\n\n### “秒杀”黑洞的天体\n\n在天文学界**，类星体可以被称之为是能够秒杀黑洞的天体**。与黑洞一样，**类星体也有着对于周围物质的吞噬能力**，而且在类星体中心一般都有着一个巨星的黑洞存在，也就是说：**这两者之间是一种包含与被包含的关系。**\n\n**在黑洞的帮助之下，类星体会吞噬周边的物质，并且在吞噬的过程中不断旋转物质产生摩擦**，类星体的发光原理基本上就可以被归类于物质摩擦时所产生的光能和热能。在这个过程中，**类星体甚至还能向外传送大量的热能辐射以及射线光波。**\n\n所以不论从哪个角度来说，**类星体在宇宙当中的毁坏力都是要高于黑洞的，因为黑洞自身的运动速率并不算快，而类星体却可以以一种超快的速度在宇宙当中横行霸道，**吞噬周边的一切物质。\n\n### 人类是否会受到影响？\n\n那么我们人类是否会受到类星体这种天体的影响呢？这个问题的答案是暂时否定的，因为宇宙中的类星体距离我们都十分遥远，**哪怕放任不管，它们也要足足花上几十亿甚至几百亿年的时间才能够来到可能对地球产生威胁的位置。**\n\n我们的**太阳系正处在一个难得的稳定期，人类可以在这个时间段大力谋求自身的发展。**目前的科学界普遍认为，类星体是整个宇宙当中毁坏力最为惊人的天体，它的出现以及高速运动在某种意义上限制了宇宙生命的发展。\n\n**如果整个宇宙空间内没有类星体这种物质的存在，取而代之的就会是大量的恒星以及星系结构，生命也就能更容易的产生了。**", "timestamp": 1658282573, "digest": "MTrsBfBTiTmCgck00JCqzYiH6jL5o9mynplJEf192wk", "contributor": "0xb3a1316BcD2bE65F2Ba67740946E8F01c0E1311E"}

That is, registering ENS domains containing names of prominent entities beforehand and then later demanding a high price for the domain should the said entity wishes to enter the Web 3.0 space later on.\n\nSince its inception in 2017, there have been over 1.67 million .eth domain registrations across approximately 482,000 owners. More than 154,100 registrations were made recentl between July 5 to July 18, partly due to [lower gas fees](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-name-service-registrations-surge-by-200-amid-lower-gas-fees) and continued interest from entities seeking to enter the Web 3.0 space. To date, the ENS collection on OpenSea has witnessed approximately 46,200 ETH ($71.5 million) in cumulative transaction volume. ", "timestamp": 1658282391, "digest": "-pAwMwTaWlCAVe9zq2xys5OMz8E3TGWvnAYJkzgtsSo", "contributor": "0x9B3492b79E45b21156eE02Daec63af6d1B7368b4"}
