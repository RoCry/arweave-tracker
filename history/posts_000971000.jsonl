"***作者：Raxy@Jsquare/DFG***\n\n***推特：@Raxy2001***\n\n***文中提到的多个与作者或所在公司存在利益相关，本文不包含任何投资建议、想法和观点与公司的项目利益相关。***\n\n近期发生的连续性断断续续，认为会因为以下几场类似的需求增加，我可能会涌现出来，而我在市场上出现了广泛流行的流行趋势，有一点想出来，出现明显的表现形式错误还请指正。\n\n### 1/UST能够对有同样重要的打击标准，在上链时刻对用户隐私权有重要的要求，重要的持有者许可和要求是关键，同样满足。\n\n代表链上所有区块链当前所有账面的数量和存在的数字和数字是由来帮助我们以不断进行的追踪和分析市场发现的市场发现的，并且，如果市场数据的数据去识别鲸鱼。\n\n所以，所有数据都属于不同的属性，没有隐私保护，当你的账目被查出你的时候，你的归属地完全透明化，准备好一个地址，每个人都准备好一个新的遗体加油开始使用，。我们需要去探索这个秘密，牛熊赛场的到底是什么？\n\n零知识证明技术在 80 年代期间，但在 2016 年的 Zcash 出现之前，并没有有效或真正用于任何用途。\n\n使用 Groth16 技术的 Zcash 不会提供的类型的地址：受保护的公开地址（z）和透明地址（t），不，其相关地址交易、、器或加密等内容。透明地址（t）可以在浏览中查看。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qS1-NQQNPCFXZsEb8X90K.png?height=722&width=1378)\n\n并且 Zcash 提供的地址类型之间可以相互处理，这样就可以从一个自由选择的地址选择把资产从地址发送到 T 来交易可以发送的状态，也可以从 Z 进行状态。\n\n![上图为Zcash的Z和T地址转换过程](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0cWVVs_4w8JWx2IjjKk6K.png?height=722&width=1228)\n\n但 Zcash 有一个漏洞，每个人都可以使用特定的重要情况产生密钥验证，有时他们的证明，他们就可以证明，所以，如果主密钥会非常有信心。\n\nZcash在当时迎来了很多思考者的讨论，也包括反洗钱法的压力。\n\n> Arnold & Porter法律公司的一位研究员Pratin Vallabhaneni说：\n>\n> “所有的相同的合规基础设施仍然需要到位。如果你是一个Zcash用户并认为‘哦，我可以进行更加匿名的交易。那么这样想是不正确的，因为如果你不披露基本的身份信息，你将无法进入金融生态系统的其余部分。”\n\n所以，发展至今，我们需对隐私需求寻找一个明确的small panel，链上的dApp都是通过用户和智能合约进行不同复杂程度的交易来组成的。所以任何隐私解决方案都必须确保dApp的这两个原子组件都是私有的。\n\n**我和wiger在经过讨论后得出一个共识，隐私不光需要解决简单的交易或者某些行为匿名。而是需要一个大的生态系统，其中包括不同的隐私应用来服务用户。举个例子，一个巨鲸或做市商在真实的交易过程中，为了保证风险敞口，可能会采用多种策略来进行操作，但目前这些行为都没办法得到隐私需求的满足。**\n\n**所以，我们需要一个大的框架和系统，基于其隐私技术进行开发和创建应用**。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FalChDHwZU1qEGmeWTn1m.png?height=672&width=1386)\n\nAleo是一个完全私有应用程序的平台，它的核心还是ZKP，但Aleo提供了一种全栈解决方案，让ZK在堆栈的每一层都拥有可编程性，从而实现大规模的去中心化私有计算。对于用户和交易这两者原子组件Aleo可以确保其不会泄露任何识别信息。\n\nAleo也支持可组合和私有的应用，并且提供了一套新的编程语言框架“Leo”，“Leo“强调可读性和易用性，外观非常像一套传统的编程语言框架，抽象了低级别的密码学概念，对开发者非常友好。\n\n整体采用一套名为ZEXE（零知识执行）的系统，在执行状态转换的过程中产生一个证明并捆绑到链上交易中，交易通过创建链上记录来更新系统状态，使得最终这笔交易仅包含证明，而不包含证明的输入。Aleo将隐蔽的过程命名为“zkCloud”，它是Aleo堆栈中的一个组件。\n\n”zkCloud”实现了受保护身份之间的编程交互，这些身份可以是用户、组织、DAO等等。这个计算模型可以在本地运行或委托给专门的验证者。\n\n![zkCloud工作方式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8wE9TCxODawGmd9LkV_an.png?height=678&width=1374)\n\n在Zcash的基础上，Aleo不仅做到了资产转移匿名，包括简单的支付、提供流动性、治理投票、身份认证等等，只有交互方知道细节，恶意第三方无法了解任何细节或以任何方式利用它。\n\n**除此之外，我认为同样采用ZKP的Aztec也不错，Aztec将弥补以太坊的隐私需求。以及采用TEE的Secret Network，采用ZK需要的信任更少，TEE的发展可能更快，有点类似Cosmos和Polkadot的感觉。**\n\n### **2/ 三箭的高额信贷变成了债务危机，体现了信贷是一个需要多个中间件和基础设施完善的市场。**\n\n链上信贷还是早期市场，缺乏大量的中间件和基础设施，并且部分问题可能需要模块化解决，例如监管许可的牌照，成熟的DID系统，合理的链上信用算法模型等等。\n\n如果3AC的钱包资产价格在峰值时，我相信信贷平台一定会给其评分为满分。所以，在思考信贷业务之前，我们可知**信贷的核心在于信用体系的建设和借款方的能够支付的利率和资质。**\n\n我们先来说信用体系，信用体系的建设就离不开链下与链上应该如何共存的问题。\n\nDID产品一直在探索如何将链上和链下结合或取舍，他们仍在将身份尽可能的数据化、结构化，但鉴于市场已经出现的标尺和标准有限，导致DID目前还没看到一个采用率较高的产品。\n\n所以在目前的信贷业务中的信用体系建设，也更多的是进行链下的评估。链下评估意味着评估模型是黑箱，加密信贷仍然还是一个脆弱的业务线。\n\n![不同风险评估方法分析](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5o7ixTYQbFkBtdEsauiPq.png?height=534&width=1404)\n\n***我们在这里拿Maple Finance、Truefi、Goldfinch三种协议/产品来区分其信用评估方法。***\n\nMaple Finance提出了流动池代表（Pool Delegate）来引入和评估贷款，每个借贷池可以由不同的池代表引入和评估。他们为借款方提供的抵押率是0-50%，主要客户是Crypto native的机构。\n\n![Orthogonal Trading和Maven11是主要的两个Pool Delegates](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UDTru9SLpcJSimmiQVnqm.png?height=938&width=1404)\n\nMaple Finance 允许Pool Delegates与借款人协商贷款条款，例如利率、到期日和抵押比率。\n\n![Maple Finance的运作方式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YD0GTp4Wp_0jweoNB6SHq.png?height=744&width=1318)\n\n而TrueFi 选择了以DAO为核心来进行投票，评估社区最初为每笔贷款设定了所有条款，除此之外，借款人还需要获得持有$stkTRU 的个人批准。每个贷款请求都需要 80% 以上的批准率。\n\n![TrueFi的运作方式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TtV8bR6Dx47nRTB9-7EeO.png?height=582&width=1402)\n\nGoldfinch选择的是采用第三方合作伙伴团队来进行审核评估（Persona 或 Parallel Markets），借款方需要Stake其代币$GFI，大概需要2倍的成本。然后提交机构的信用报表和财务报表交给这个团队。审核成功后，借款方会收到一个链接到其指定钱包的一种不可转让、唯一身份（UID）的NFT，以避免女巫攻击。随后，系统将进行随机选择9名审计员中的6名来进行批准借款。（这里比较类似Truefi，同样也是需要有原生token作为投票权的个人）\n\n![Goldfinch的运作方式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-XnLZTQ73XVJqBaZ6etIM.png?height=424&width=1422)\n\n**从整体设计形式来看，三者最大的区别就是对于贷款的评估方式。**\n\n**但其共同点都是以一个中心化的人/团队来进行信用评估，即便其包含了代币持有者的利益相关个体，但我相信他们仍然对于那些超级巨鲸的债务感受到迷茫且未知。**\n\n**那么又回到我们刚才提出的问题。**\n\n**“如果3AC的钱包资产价格在峰值时，Maple和Truefi以及Goldfinch的评估模式会给3AC打多少分？”**\n\n**链上的信誉和信用风险评分是主要难题，而信用，是需要强权政府、国家机器或法律等条款来进行背书的，信用不是凭空产生的。**\n\nMaven11和Orthogonal Trading用什么来担保这个信用的背书，仅仅是提前放入池中的资产吗？UST是一个非常好的尝试，在LFG购买BTC之前，我曾是Terra的信仰者，但后来我发现这种信用带来的杠杆越来越高，信用本质上需要时间来建立，需要不断的试错。\n\n**那么为什么加密市场仍然有这么多层出不穷的抵押率模型和信用评估模型，乱象频出？**\n\n**我们认为其本质原因在于，没人能承诺还不上钱会怎样，同样也没人敢去对赌还上钱了又怎么样。**\n\n同时，因为DeFi和传统银行的利差较大，也形成了一种借款方不愿支付较高利率的局面。（如果愿意支付高利率的借款方很可能资质不过关，这里就存在一个风险性），迫使Maple和Truefi需要用自身代币进行补贴激励。**我认为目前的链上的机构信贷业务仍然处在一个努力寻找PMF的节点。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JSRiAxxhb0g2X3xMX3xmf.png?height=782&width=1190)\n\n***但债务有重组的时候，也有新的周期会产生，信贷仍然是不可忽视的Defi发动机因素之一。***\n\n我们刚刚提到了Defi和传统银行的利差较大，而利差，创造了借入需求。\n\n但借入资产的同时，意味着you’re short，准确的说是你多少有隐性的做空意识和想法，或认为其价格在短时间内可能处于震荡状态。\n\n这在Tradefi中，被称为carry trade，当carry trade出现巨大波动时，tradefi的收益率下降，导致AAVE和Compound等主流借贷平台中的rate下降。并且Defi中的稳定币存在depeg的可能性，因为其应用场景目前仍然有限。\n\n所以，当流动性收紧时，用户的生活可能更多采用法币来计价，于是用户即使借出DAI等稳定币，仍然会去cex中兑换成usdc或者法币。所以，我们会发现更多的传统巨头以及巨鲸开始尝试做空stable coin使其发生depeg，这是一个套利的机会。\n\n恰好，也因为信贷等业务的信用算法模型不够完善等等因素，使DeFi的超额抵押模式成为了主流，以确保借贷平台的安全性和国库的流动性来更好的控制风险。\n\n***我曾对DeFi的真正资本效率抱有一种悲观的态度，我认为超额抵押并不是完美的，甚至拥有原罪。***\n\n* 加密市场的资产价格波动可能长时间的处于剧烈状态，因为超额抵押会很容易的形成高度恐慌的挤兑狂潮，巨鲸为了保持清算线安全，很可能抛售ALTcoin来聚拢流动性填补抵押品。\n* 我觉得超额抵押模式在部分流动性不足的公链中，是一个吸血虫。当你用该链原生协议资产，为了变现而借出大量的ETH、BTC、USDC时，本质上你抽干了该链的非原声资产流动性。使得某些公链TVL较高但多是难以变现的原生资产（除非你愿意忍受dex上极高的滑点）。\n* 超额抵押的模式带来了Debt Ceilings（债务上限问题）\n\n但我认为超额抵押的确是一个更好控制风险的方式，对于加密原生的流动性来说，最合适的标的应该就是为超额抵押发行的稳定币，连环清算或许是对Crypto最好的进化方式，抵押品是否能够支撑起这面大旗也很重要。\n\n就在今天，AAVE宣布推出了自己的超额抵押稳定币（GHO），很有可能会抢占部分稳定币市场份额，要观察一下GHO是否能利用aave的背书迅速在几个defi协议中建立一些应用场景了。在此之前我还在思考，链上银行究竟是什么样lol，可能就快拥有答案了。\n\n### **3/ 信用评估体系的缺陷，体现了Defi原生认证系统、去中心化声誉评分系统的重要性**\n\n在这里我选择分享ARCx，这是我非常喜欢的项目，\\*\\*从Slogan层面，它解决了我对超额抵押的困惑，以及隐私，包括信贷的信用评分体系，\\*\\*所以我必须要提到ARCx，**但我们仍需要观察他的采用率。**\n\n**以及，他所设计的信用评分体系究竟在实践中能否真正解决上述所说的问题。**\n\n它设计了一种Defi Passport（0-999分），ARCx将根据过去用户与各种DeFi协议的钱包交互生成一个信用评分，评估标准包含许多变量，例如贷款、清算、空投和用户行为等等。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ov8zALZOev946T3VI0B2z.png?height=776&width=1394)\n\n> Andrew Beal 在他[最近的帖子](https://30000feet.substack.com/p/issue-20-reputation)中所说：\n>\n> “DeFi 生态系统是金融体系的一个新象限，但从声誉的角度来看，它是一个与大陆分离的岛屿。为什么？\n>\n> 没有身份。\n>\n> 你为在传统金融系统中建立声誉所做的所有工作都不适用，因为 DeFi 生态系统不知道你是谁。这就像在大三中途转学一样。你前两年所做的一切都已经过去了，你必须从头开始。”\\*\n\n### **4/ 我们在早期投资了NFT3和Litentry，我将举例NFT3来切入我对去中心化身份的思考。**\n\n> *“一种主观的感觉，以及个人相似性和连续性的可观察质量，再加上对某些共享世界形象的相似性和连续性的某种信念。 作为一种无意识的生活质量，这在一个发现自己和发现自己的社区的年轻人中非常明显。 在其中，我们看到了不可逆转地给予的独特统一的出现，即体型和气质，天赋和脆弱性，童年模式和后天的理想，并公开了可用角色，职业可能性，价值观的选择权。提供，导师发现，建立了友谊和初次性接触”。 （Erikson，1970年*\n\n当“身份“一词置于网络时，我们似乎可以将其拆解为存储、管理、检索信息等组合性的框架。\n\n但“身份”涉及到了“自我哲学(philosophy of self)”，当我们探讨“自我”时，我们应该认为人是一个整体存在的。身份是一个人的社会属性，一定程度上也是一个人的价值体现。\n\n伏尔泰在他的《哲学词典》中关于“身份”一词写道：\n\n“只有记忆才能建立起身份，即个人的相同性。“\n\n“我今天的身份很明显是来自于我昨天的经历，以及它在我身体和意识中留下的痕迹。”\n\n**曾经，我们的身份被宗教和极权塑造。如今，没有了信仰和帝王，确有了许许多多评级和考核体系。**\n\n**这些成为控制我们的无形枷锁，如今，我们是否能够通过解构“身份”这个词语，来让真实世界的“自我”更洒脱？把社会属性的认可交给能够建构且拆分的网络身份？**\n\n**Web3让每个用户和构建者都可以控制自己的数据、价值、关系、以及信息。每个用户都将成为自身数据的统一发现点，从应用程序之间，从交互之间去感受其中的可组合性。**\n\n**这或许会创造共享网络效应类似的复合性体验，而孤立的，操控用户隐私和数据信息的将会成为孤岛。且依赖地址和NFT等作为基础进行延伸的去中心化身份系统将受到非常大的限制。**\n\n0xBcfd在他的帖子中表示，我们可以从原始密码身份系统的缺陷中学习，看看在更可靠的去中心化身份系统中需要什么。很明显，单一的注册表（索引）、标识符标准或数据结构标准是过于死板的。\n\n它必须与各种标识符一起使用。它必须对一组灵活、可扩展的数据模型和结构开放。它必须跨网络环境和网络工作。它的设计应该遵循**身份是关于管理和发现信息的原则，因此它应该把数据放在首位。**\n\n**这表明了一个简单的设计：每个标识符都维护一个包含自己数据的表。** **统一的，这些以身份为中心的用户表形成了*互联网的分布式用户表*。**\n\n这个分布式用户表不是一个实际的表，而是一个虚拟表，它由与传统用户表的部分相对应的几个组成部分产生：\n\n*标识符（Identifier）*：去中心化标识符不应是应用程序数据库中的条目，而应该是可证明的唯一性和密码学控制的。可访问性需要在各种网络中接受多种形式的标识符——类似于*分散标识符*的DID标准。\n\n*数据结构（Data Structures)*：类似于应用程序开发人员如何定义自己的数据结构，分散的数据层需要使开发人员能够定义自定义数据模型，同时确保这些模型可重用和公开存储。\n\n*索引(Index)*：用户在应用程序定义数据模型时带来他们的标识符。标准索引可以将这些元素组合到一个用户表（或应用程序表）中，以便当用户与应用程序交互（创建数据）时，该信息被适当地编目以供将来路由。这会创建一个易于发现的用户数据记录——映射到数据模型并以加密方式关联到标识符。\n\n![一个分布式虚拟用户表，具有来自不同网络的各种 DID、开发人员定义的数据模型以及相关记录](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/svFzamznDUFdry8vbgnzh.png?height=658&width=1390)\n\n所以，一个合理的去中心化身份系统应该具有以下三个标准。\n\n**无需信任的（Dependable）：在任何人都可以参与的公共网络集合上运行，包括分区或本地网络**\n\n**灵活的（Flexible）：适用于开发人员可以定义的任何数据结构**\n\n**可访问性强的（Accessible） ：适用于任何开放的网络和唯一标识符**\n\n并且通过其他复杂因子来进行补充和完善，例如。\n\n* 假名优先（Pseudonymous-first）：无需创建帐户或验证即可开始，用户（或其他实体）只需携带一个加密密钥对，即可开始围绕它积累信息\n* 生成（Generative）：信息随着时间的推移而积累，创造出一个新兴的整体身份\n* 可组合性（Composable）：无需预先定义的集成或可移植性标准，就可以跨上下文发现和共享信息\n* 可分离和选择性（Separable and selective）：信息集可以加密或混淆，或跨多个标识符分离，或以其他方式可根据控制器的偏好进行分割\n\n**我们需要一个建立了管理和路由到可信数据的最低限度协议，其他一切都交给开发人员的创意，让这些变得具有独特性和多样性。**\n\nNFT3能够让用户通过简单便捷的方式访问协议，建立自己的身份系统，同时保证个人隐私和主权。\n\n并构建一个名为“NCredit”的信用评分系统，更高的评分有利于链上更高的治理投票权重，借贷时降低利率以及抵押率优惠（ARCx同样也有），参与IDO时获得更多的份额等等。\n\n它提供了一个SDK来给项目的developer接入，NFT3则负责DID的网关。用户可以选择按照自己的条件共享数据，因此任何接入了NFT3 SDK的dApp都可根据用户意愿来进行访问。\n\n在底层NFT3接入了存储系统，并且进行了机器学习模仿用户数据，最终传向愿意接入sdk的应用，把独特性和多样性交给开发者和用户，实现一个真正的最低限度身份协议。\n\n![NFT3工作方式](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XoPNK0jkaujm5FC1AsFoY.png?height=666&width=1308)\n\n**对于此次市场出现大规模的清算和去杠杆，我进行了一个对市场格局的思路整理。**\n\n那么回到文章最开始，为什么CeFi仍然有如此大的市场空间？\n\n显然，CeFi有优点所在，我也并不认为未来将是DeFi完全取代CeFi。\n\n因为其拓客速度，决策速度，专业化的定制服务等等的确更满足普通用户的需求。\n\n并且其滑点低，那些对加密市场流动性格局理解较浅的用户很适合CeFi。\n\n**上文即Part 1，我大胆预测这些赛道会有一个不错的需求端增长。但同时也需要市场来证明这些需求是否真实，adoption的变化曲线如何。**\n\n**理解，我将在第 2 部分中，确定我对以下问题的理解和举例，特别是协议的流动健康性的部分。**\n\n**问题主要集中于：**\n\n1/

Feminist author Diana E. H. Russell first defined the term in 1976 as \"the killing of females by males because they are female.\" Others include the killing of females by females.*\n\n*Intimate partner violence affects 3 in 10 women over a lifetime. It is estimated that 13.5% of homicides globally involve intimate partners.*\n\n*Opponents argue that since over 80% of all murder victims are men, the term places too much emphasis on the murder of females. However, a partner is responsible in almost 40% of homicides involving a female victim, compared with 6% for homicides involving a male victim. In addition, femicide may be underreported.*\n\n![He will be sorely missed by the HBO family.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sm3frR8lxKiL6CBwPYj7c.png?height=1170&width=760)\n\nMisogyny is usually associated with men who hate women.

In an otherwise over crowded metropolis that is Mumbai, this suburb maintains it’s quaintness with colonial era cottages, greenery and a mix of accessible nightlife venues against a backdrop of skyscrapers, making it a highly desirable location. The same holds for other mega cities; Clarke Quay in Singapore… Sh.Zayed Road, Dubai… Sunset Strip…\n\nHowever, unlike real life, where natural land formations, weather and economic activity dictate the price of property and where slums jostle for space with high-rises as the header picture exemplifies…in the Metaverse\\* many of these constraints do not hold water (a little foreshadowing there).\n\n**Myth: LAND SCARCITY IN THE METAVERSE:** Scarcity in the Metaverse, is a myth. A myth propagated by unscrupulous crypto brokers — whose sole motivation is to speculate on profits of funny-money, a.k.a. cryptocurrency *after* a deal has been transacted. Thus their desire to turn the Metaverse into a ‘Cryptoverse’. A world where every interaction is a Transaction.\n\n*They forget, for scarcity to work in virtual real-estate, one needs to abolish that ancient practice of…Teleporting*\n\nNo one walks in the Metaverse. The mode of commuting is usually a laser point and click mechanic, to cover any amount of distance in a second. No downtown traffic to negotiate, no crowded footpaths to traverse.\n\nThe Cryptoverses selling digital land parcels, [and there a few of them reviewed here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/metaverse-being-designed-man-babies-clyde-desouza/), would have you believe that the same conditions that dictate prices IRL, apply to the Metaverse. Again — teleporting disproves it. Spinning up another server disproves it. The premise of ‘virtual society’ as an argument does not hold true.\n\nIn real life — yes, I’d likely not want to commute to ‘Sobo’ (South Bombay) to mingle, because it would take an hour. In the Metaverse I could mingle in virtual Times Square NY, and then teleport to Clarke Quay, Singapore, in a second. That’s what the metaverse offers.\n\n![The Atlantis Dubai: Underwater Suite](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zv9z_cHBgHBeud-hNISGj.jpg?height=717&width=1920)\n\nI was fortunate to visit the Atlantis Dubai’s Underwater Suite and remember saying to myself — This is the ***virtual world***\\* \\*I’d love to have projected on my windows at home. Such real estate would be at a premium as one would imagine. But, in a virtual world; a Metaverse? Those land-parcels that Cryptoverses like to dice into blocks and sell at a premium on the public Blockchain, because it’s near the coast or at the ‘city center’?… you understand why that’s a fallacy now.\n\n![The XR Metaverse draped over the Real World.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jcm0SvtaFmcLwi5-SHXa9.gif?height=293&width=520)\n\n\\***Plot Twist: THE XR METAVERSE**\n\nSo far we’ve been looking at the Metaverse to be a virtual world that’s either entered into typically via a VR headset for maximum immersion or, accessed through a desktop computer or tablet. However, the XR-Metaverse ***can drape*** itself as a digital overlay — pin registered — to the real world, and seen via Augmented Reality eyewear, or today, via a cellphone camera; dubbed video-seethru AR. Solutions such as [Google’s Spatial API ](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/geospatial)can make it happen. This was near-future hard sci-fi which I’d written about in 2010; [Will Google create a Surrogate Reality World](https://realvision.ae/blog/2010/01/will-google-create-a-surrogate-reality-world/), and today we can experience it.\n\nSo what does that mean for virtual real estate in the XR Metaverse? Surely — its value will proportionately skyrocket in tandem with its real world twin. Or will it?\n\n> *Who owns Bandra West in the XR Metaverse? — The Government, The Telcos, The Roads and Transport Authority?*\n\nThat’s the right question to ask. Cryptoverse operators who currently sell “land” at ridiculous prices will try to justify prices by saying ***their Metaverse***\\* \\*is pin-registered to the real world where real world inhabitants will be populating it (either in person or as digital avatars of themselves)\n\nThe problem is the metaverse needs to be accessed via a gateway — usually, a Telco gateway or portal.\n\n**ENTER, THE MULTIVERSE:**\n\nWho’s to stop:\n\n* Vodafone from running a parallel XRMetaverse draped over the same real world location as Reliance Jio does.\n* AT&T running their metaverse over Verizon’s pin registered to the same Times Square.\n* An enterprising Entrepreneur overlaying Bangalore’s MG road and storefront signage over Bandra’s Linking Road\n\nIndeed, there is no guarantee — just because celebs reside in real-life in one location that they would be seen in the XR metaverse at venues \\*in that same location \\*. They could be ‘partying’ at an underwater nightclub anywhere in the Metaverse.\n\n\\*\\*CONCLUSION: \\*\\*The Metaverse is a world of Abundance not of Scarcity\n\nScarcity if at all, will be driven not by rarity of NFTs (another fallacy there) or “Land parcels” but by bandwidth demands and the spatial mandates of avatar ‘personal space’ when accessing desirable hot-spots where like minded “minds” hang-out. Even then, it depends on the Telco gate or portal entered.\n\n***“…***It could be Bandra west or anywhere…Liverpool or Rome… ’cause the Metaverse is anywhere…everywhere alone…”\n\n*( [h/t to the Beautiful South](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06EbMhzwLBw)*)", "timestamp": 1657371042, "digest": "XnqaSyxWg8j71TqvziBnotlC3sRj-3TG9ckJwJWP6E0", "contributor": "0x3a2FD028203Aa86D4fFd8F8106eb50c1C9146723"}

They control everything from how hard you might hit, to which cards you receive in each pack, to which panels on the battle mountain receive payments. Yet, truly random numbers are one of the hardest problems in computer science.\n\n\nIf this wasn’t bad enough, flashbots and other Miner Extractable Value (MEV) tools allow all kinds of powerful manipulation. For instance, one thing you can do is submit a ‘bundle’ of transactions, where either ALL of the transactions will run or NONE of the transactions will run. For instance, a malicious user could submit a bundle of 2 transactions\n\n1. Buy the ultimate card pack\n2. Send the Michael card I just received to my other address.\n\nNormally, a user has a 1% chance to receive a Michael card when purchasing the ultimate pack. However, by submitting this bundle, flashbots software would try to do this in every block, without any cost until the Michael card was successful. This is because the 99 times out of 100 when they received something other than the Michael card, the 2nd tx would fail so the first tx would never go in the block.\n\n\nThere are several key mitigations. We highly recommend [this excellent blog post](https://quantstamp.com/blog/proper-treatment-of-randomness-on-evm-compatible-networks) written by Martin from Quantstamp for technical details.\n\n\nIn general, the idea is to make it so that the cost of manipulating randomness in Angel Battles is higher than the benefit that an attacker can receive. We also have to balance this out with the difficulty imposed on honest players. For instance, the result of a simple swing of the sword uses only the built in randomness. If someone were to go to the time and expense to manipulate a single PVP battle on the leaderboard so that they could defeat a marginally stronger opponent, that opponent can always just reclaim the spot right afterwards.\n\n\nHowever, there are two key aspects of Angel Battles that must be protected. These are getting the ultimate pack and changing conditions on the battle mountain.\n\n\n**Getting the Ultimate Pack** – You must burn Halo tokens in order to receive a card from the ultimate pack. In this case, you will first send a ‘commit’ transaction. This commits you to the action – you must burn your Halo tokens and information about the resulting card is stored in the contract. This information is private, meaning other contracts are not allowed to read it. Finally, you must come back at least 10 blocks later and send a ‘reveal’ transaction, where you will actually receive your card.\n\n\n**Changing Mountain Conditions** – Mountain conditions can be changed every 24 hours, and any player may change the conditions for all players. Thus, one player commits, and then any player can reveal after 10 blocks. Once a player has committed, the next player must reveal.", "timestamp": 1657371464, "digest": "aQ5g3MdXyEt_LpW9CMCtqq-LqXMnhmVRXgcN0XqYsP0", "contributor": "0x20886Ba6fD8731ed974ba00108F043fC9006e1f8"}

It allows me to spend more time doing this and put out the articles sooner. Thank you!*\n\n\n---\n\nCryptography is a branch of mathematics concerned with the secure transmission and protection of information. It is one of Ethereum’s technological pillars. It safeguards information by encoding it so that only the intended recipients can understand and process the information.\n\nThere are two different types of accounts in Ethereum: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and contracts. EOAs have key pairs consisting of a private key and a public key. Private keys, along with digital signatures and Ethereum addresses, prove the ownership of the funds and assets in EOAs.\n\nAll user interaction with Ethereum is made possible using private keys. A private key uniquely determines an Ethereum address, which represents the intended recipient of a transaction. When you send a transaction on Ethereum, you need to digitally sign a message– this digital signature is also created using the private key. Anyone who has an account’s private key has full control of the funds and assets it holds. Keep your private key to yourself!\n\nHow is a public key derived from a private key? How do we prove ownership of an account without having to reveal our private key? How are digital signatures unique? Well, we need to start with the basics of cryptography to answer these questions. The topics we’ll cover are:\n\n* Cryptography basics and mathematical foundations,\n* Cryptographic hash functions and uses\n* Symmetric, Asymmetric cryptography\n* Elliptic curve cryptography, and\n* Digital Signatures: ECDSA.\n\n***Trigger warning: Math;*** it is optional and there is no test at the end. But give it a few minutes and you’ll understand everything better.\n\n## Cryptography Foundations\n\n### Trapdoor Functions\n\nIn mathematics, we have some functions that are easy to calculate but their inverses aren’t. For example, finding the product of two large prime numbers is straightforward. But given the product of two large primes, it is difficult to find its prime factors.\n\nIf you had some secret information, it’d be easy for you to invert some of these functions. Such functions are called trapdoor functions. For example, if you know one of the prime numbers in the previous example, it is trivial to find the other via simple division. Trapdoor functions are **not used in cryptography** to avoid loopholes in cryptographic protocols. If they were, secret information would be revealed.\n\nAn advanced category of mathematical functions based on elliptic curve arithmetic is used in cryptography. It is easy to find the product of two large prime numbers modulo a prime, but given the result, we can’t find the two prime factors. This is called the [Discrete Logarithm Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) (DLP). DLP over certain groups has no trapdoors– this acts as a foundation for a large number of cryptographic protocols.\n\n### Modular Arithmetic\n\nIn mathematics, [modular arithmetic](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic) is a system of integer arithmetic where numbers wrap around when they reach a certain value, called the **modulus**. The modulo operation returns the remainder when one number is divided by another. For example, 11 mod 3 evaluates to 2 because we get a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 2 when we divide 11 by 3.\n\nFor a positive integer *n*, two integers *a* and *b* are called congruent modulo *n* if *a* and *b* differ by a multiple of *n*. That is, for an integer *k*,\n\n*a* − *b* = *kn*\n\nCongruence modulo *n* is denoted as:\n\n*a* ≡ *b* (mod *n*).\n\nThe parentheses here mean that (mod *n*) applies to the entire equation, and not just the right-hand side. This is different from the binary operation “*a* mod *b”*, which refers to the modulo operation and simply returns the remainder after *a* is divided by *b*.\n\n*a ≡ b* (mod *n*) implies that *a* and *b* have the same remainder when they are divided by *n*. That is,\n\n[split://0x01559B3d778DFce4857D6Faa9f04aaE399025027](split://0x01559B3d778DFce4857D6Faa9f04aaE399025027)\n\n[split://0x01559B3d778DFce4857D6Faa9f04aaE399025027](split://0x01559B3d778DFce4857D6Faa9f04aaE399025027)\n\nwhere *r* is the common remainder such that 0 ≤ *r* < *n*. For example,\n\n38 ≡ 3 (mod 5) holds because 38 — 3 = 35, which is a multiple of 5. 38 and 3 also have the same remainder 3 when divided by 5.\n\nThe DLP can be stated as:\n\n> *a, b* and *m* are three integers\\*.\\* Find an integer *k* such that \\*\\**aᵏ ≡ b (mod m)*, where the greatest common divisor of *a* and *m* is 1.\n\n### Fields\n\nA field is a set *F* with two binary operations on *F* called addition and multiplication, denoted using + and *⋅* respectively. These operations must satisfy the following properties, called the field axioms:\n\n1. **Associativity of Addition and Multiplication:** *a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c,* and *a ⋅ (b ⋅ c) = (a ⋅ b) ⋅ c.*\n2. **Commutativity of Addition and Multiplication:** *a + b = b + a,* and *a ⋅ b = b ⋅ a.*\n3. **Additive and Multiplicative Identity:** there exist two different elements 0 and 1 in *F* such that *a +* 0 *= a* and *a ⋅* 1 *= a*.\n4. \\*\\*Additive Inverse: \\*\\*for every *a* in *F*, there exists an element *-a* ∈ *F*, called the additive inverse of *a*, such that *a + (-a) =* 0.\n5. **Multiplicative Inverse:** For any *a* ∈ *F* such that *a ≠* 0, there exists *a⁻ ¹* ∈ *F* called the multiplicative inverse of *a*, such that *a ⋅ a⁻ ¹ =* 1.\n6. **Distributivity of Multiplication Over Addition:** *a ⋅ (b + c) = (a ⋅ b) + (a ⋅ c).*\n\nIn these axioms, *a*, *b* and *c* are arbitrary elements in the field *F*.\n\n[https://twitter.com/howie_hua/status/1533875711466868738?s=20&t=lHwtI2_Gxp5zYhSBsg8GxQ](https://twitter.com/howie_hua/status/1533875711466868738?s=20&t=lHwtI2_Gxp5zYhSBsg8GxQ)\n\n\n---\n\n## Cryptographic Hash Functions\n\nHash functions are used in computer programming to convert text (or other data) to integers. The process of calculating the value of a certain hash function is called hashing. Hashing usually maps distinct inputs to distinct outputs, but there might be collisions sometimes. Since hashing is irreversible by design, there are no quick algorithms for recovering the input message from its hash value.\n\n![Mapping text to integers using a hash function](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CW_bM1FoCirl7hs3Sllaz.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\nIn cryptography, hash functions convert arbitrary-sized input data (e.g. a message) to a fixed-size result (e.g. 256 bits). The result is called a hash value (hash code, message digest, or simply hash). Hash functions utilized in cryptography are called cryptographic hash functions. These are one-way hash functions that are **infeasible to invert**. The likelihood of finding a collision via brute force for a strong cryptographic hash function, like SHA-256, is extremely low. There are no known collisions for most modern strong cryptographic hash functions.\n\n![The output of a cryptographic hash function](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A8n_HfIzpShigFHCvJUeJ.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\nThe **ideal cryptographic hash function** is:\n\n* **Deterministic:** Given a fixed input, the value of the output will never change.\n* **Quick:** Computing the hash for any message should be efficient (linear complexity).\n* **Difficult to Decipher:** A small change in the message will result in an extensive change in the hash value. Hence, we cannot derive any information about the original message from its hash value.\n* **Irreversible:** Deriving an input message from its hash should be computationally infeasible. This implies that using brute force (trial and error) is the best approach for doing so.\n* **Collision Resistant:** Finding two input messages with the same hash should be computationally difficult.\n\nThe Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA) are a family of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. SHA-3 functions are deemed more secure than SHA-2 functions. The SHA-3 family of cryptographic hash algorithms, unlike SHA-2, is not prone to **length extension attacks**\\*.\\* In a length extension attack, a hacker can create a valid new hash by extending an existing one without knowing the original message or the private key used to create the hash.\n\nThe “Keccak” hashes family represents the SHA-3 hashes family and is based on the concept of “[sponge construction](https://keccak.team/sponge_duplex.html#:\\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20cryptography,is%20called%20a%20sponge%20function.)”. Ethereum uses a variant of SHA-256 called Keccak-256.\n\n```\nSHA3–256('hello') = 3338be694f50c5f338814986cdf0686453a888b84f424d792af4b9202398f392\n\nKeccak-256('hello') = 1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8\n\nSHA3–512('hello') = 75d527c368f2efe848ecf6b073a36767800805e9eef2b1857d5f984f036eb6df891d75f72d9b154518c1cd58835286d1da9a38deba3de98b5a53e5ed78a84976\n```\n\n### Random Number Generators\n\nRandomness is crucial in cryptography. For example, we need a private key to access the assets in an Ethereum account. This private key should be randomly generated in a way that no one else can generate it. If a secure random number generator is used, the key will be unpredictable and the system will be secure. Hence, “secure random” simply just means “**unpredictably random**”.\n\nIn computer science, random numbers usually come from [Pseudorandom Number Generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) (PRNGs). The sequence of random numbers generated by a PRNG is deterministic and not truly random, as it is entirely determined by an initial value, called the PRNG’s **seed**. If a PRNG gets hacked, it will generate predictable random numbers. This allows hackers to reveal your private keys, sign malicious messages, and so on. Hence, it is essential to generate “truly random” numbers.\n\n#### CSPRNG\n\nCryptographically Secure PRNGs (CSPRNGs) are used in cryptography to make the generated randomness unpredictable. By definition, CSPRNGs are pseudo-random number generators with properties that make them suitable for use in cryptography. They often combine entropy with PRNG and other approaches. To be a CSPRNG, a PRNG must meet two major requirements:\n\n* Satisfy the **next-bit test**: If someone knows all *k* bits from the start of the PRNGs, they wouldn’t be able to predict the bit *k* **+ 1** with reasonable computing resources.\n* Withstand the **state compromise extensions**: If an attacker guesses the internal state of the PRNG or it is revealed in some way, the attacker should be unable to reconstruct all previous random numbers before the revelation.\n\nThe operating system’s entropy is usually limited. Most cryptographic applications employ CSPRNGs, which “stretch” the OS’s available entropy into more bits needed for cryptographic purposes by using cryptographic hash functions while adhering to the CSPRNG criteria.\n\nMost CSPRNGs use a combination of entropy from the operating system and a high-quality PRNG generator, and they frequently “**reseed**,” which means that when new entropy comes from the OS (for example, from user input, system interruptions, disc I/O, or hardware random generators), the underlying PRNG changes its internal state based on the new entropic bits. The CSPRNG is extremely difficult to predict and analyze due to its continual reseeding.\n\n### PoW Hash Functions\n\nThe majority of Proof of Work (PoW) algorithms generate a hash value greater than a certain threshold, known as **mining difficulty**. Blockchain PoW mining algorithms employ a special class of computationally and **memory-intensive hash functions.** Since hashes are random, miners calculate millions of distinct hashes to determine this hash value. For example, the PoW problem might be defined as:\n\n> find a number *p*, such that the hash(*x + p*) starts with 10 zero bits.\n\n**ASIC-resistance** refers to a cryptocurrency’s protocol and mining algorithms being configured in such a way that employing [ASICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) for mining is either impossible or provides no substantial advantage over standard GPU mining. Blockchains that rely on other methods of reaching consensus (like PoS, dPoS, PoA) are ASIC-resistant by design. ASIC-resistance in PoW blockchains is determined by the implementation of the mining algorithm — Bitcoin is not ASIC-resistant, while Ethereum is. This is due to Ethereum’s adoption of the **ETHash** proof-of-hash function. It’s a memory-intensive hash function, meaning that it needs a lot of RAM to be calculated quickly, making it resistant to ASICs. This is how ETHash works:\n\n* A “**seed**” is computed for each block based on the entire chain until the current block.\n* From the seed, a **16 MB pseudorandom cache** is computed.\n* From the cache, a **1 GB dataset** is extracted to be used in mining.\n* Mining involves hashing together random slices of the dataset.\n\nASIC resistance is desirable– it increases a blockchain’s degree of decentralization and makes mining affordable for everyone. [A small number of large players is bad, and a large number of small players is good](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274).\n\n\n---\n\n## Symmetric Cryptography\n\nSymmetric encryption schemes use the **same secret key** (or password) to encrypt data and decrypt it back to its original form.\n\n![Symmetric key cryptography (simplified)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Cmzh9y4bH1rougsciP5Xg.png?height=738&width=1343)\n\nThe figure here is simplified. Usually, the encryption scheme consists of:\n\n* Password to key derivation algorithm\n* Cipher algorithm\n* Cipher block mode algorithm\n* Message authentication code (MAC) algorithm.\n\nThe secret key used to cipher (encrypt) and decipher (decrypt) data is commonly 128, 192, or 256 bits in length and is sometimes referred to as an encryption key or a shared key because both the sending and receiving parties should know it. Most applications use a password-to-key-derivation scheme to extract a secret key from a certain password because users tend to remember passwords easier than binary data. A 256-bit secret key encoded as a hex string look like:\n\n```\n02c324648931b89e3e8a0fc42c96e8e3be2e42812986573a40d46563bceaf75110\n```\n\n## Asymmetric Cryptography\n\nAsymmetric cryptography or Public Key cryptography utilizes a pair of cryptographically related **public and private keys** to encrypt and decrypt data. If the data is encrypted using a private key, it can be decrypted using the corresponding public key and vice versa. As a result, someone can prove they own a certain private key while just revealing the public key that corresponds to it. RSA and ECC are two widely used public key cryptographic protocols.\n\n![Asymmetric Cryptography](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/120CtjwvC0ko6ttu08eeA.png?height=1166&width=1600)\n\nThe [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29) public-key cryptosystem is based on the math of **modular exponentiation** (numbers raised to a power by modulus) and some additional assumptions, along with the computational difficulties of the integer factorization problem. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is based on the algebraic structure of e**lliptic curves over finite fields** and the complexity of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP).\n\nECC is usually used in conjunction with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECC uses **smaller keys, ciphertexts and signatures** than RSA, and is preferred for most applications. It has been proven mathematically that a 3072-bit RSA key has similar cryptographic strength to a 256-bit ECC key. ECC’s key generation is also significantly faster than RSA’s.\n\nBlockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum use ECC to secure transactions. It is worth noting that neither RSA nor ECC is quantum-safe, which means if someone has a powerful enough quantum computer, they’ll be able to derive the private key from a public key in a matter of seconds. While this is true, it is unlikely that there will be a powerful quantum computer anytime soon(next 5–10 years), and we have already constructed quantum resistance asymmetric cryptography like learning with errors.\n\n### Key Pairs\n\nA pair of keys is used in public key cryptography — a public key and a private key. These keys are **linked mathematically** and are used together as a pair. A user controls their Ethereum account using the private key (like a password), while the public key is used to identify an account, similar to a bank account number. In ECC, the private key is used to calculate the public key, which is used to further derive an Ethereum address. In other cryptosystems (like RSA), the public key and private key are generated together but can’t be determined directly from each other.\n\nA key pair is often generated at random in a secure environment (like a hardware wallet) and the public key is revealed, while the private key is secret and is securely stored in a crypto-wallet and is protected by a password or multi-factor authentication. Keep your private key safe, anon.\n\n*[Randall Munroe](http://xkcd.com) shows the inner workings of the mind of a BAYC owner:*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/efnk3PIxjO9SYzYbRAvRT.png?height=564&width=1466)\n\n\n---\n\n## Elliptic Curve Cryptography\n\nElliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a modern family of public-key cryptography systems, based on the algebraic structures of **elliptic curves over finite fields** and the complexity of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). ECC is the modern natural successor to RSA — it uses smaller keys and signatures than RSA for the same level of security, and provides fast operations (key generation, key agreement, signatures).\n\n![The elliptic curve used by Ethereum and Bitcoin](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vk0gHIm67F2Q43Td7DIQX.png?height=620&width=520)\n\nThe DLP is based on the idea that it is difficult to factor a large integer composed of two large primes. This idea is then extended and modified for ECC protocols as — finding the **discrete logarithm of a random elliptic curve** element w.r.t. a publicly known base point is impossible. The difficulty of the problem is determined by the size of elliptic curve’s field.\n\n### Elliptic Curve Keys\n\nECC keys are integers in the range of the curve’s field size (typically 256-bit integers). Any number in this range is a valid ECC private key. Private key generation is as simple as securely generating a random number within a certain range.\n\nIn ECC, public keys are EC points, which are a pair of integer coordinates {x, y} on a curve. The EC points have special characteristics. They can be reduced to a **single coordinate plus one parity bit** (parity). This compressed public key is a 257-bit integer that corresponds to a 256-bit ECC private key. It is represented in the Ethereum format using 33 bytes (66 hex digits) and is optimized to exactly 257 bits.\n\n### Curves and key length\n\nECC algorithms can use different underlying elliptic curves. These curves that have been adopted in popular cryptography frameworks and security standards have:\n\n* a name : such as secp256k1, Curve25519\n* a field size: this determines the key length\n* security strength:  usually fieldSize / 2 or less\n* performance : operations / sec\n\nIn most applications, the default ECC private key length is **256 bits**.\n\n### Elliptic Curves\n\nAll elliptic curve algorithms use an underlying curve for calculations. They use public-private key pairs, where:\n\n* the private key is an integer, and\n* the public key is a point on the elliptic curve.\n\nBut first, what are elliptic curves?\n\nIn mathematics, elliptic curves are plane algebraic curves consisting of all points {x,y} described by the equation of a general cubic curve.\n\nIn cryptography, elliptic curves are used in a simplified form (Weierstrass form). For a [field characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_%28algebra%29#Case_of_fields) not equal to 2 or 3, the equation can be written as:\n\n*y² = x³ + **a**x + **b***\n\nThis equation when used with different values of ***a*** and ***b***, gives us different curves. For instance, the secp256k1 curve used by Bitcoin and Ethereum uses ***a*** = 0 and ***b*** = 7 :\n\n*y² = x³ + **7***\n\n### Elliptic Curves Over Finite Fields\n\nLet p > 3 be a prime. An elliptic curve *E* defined over *Fₚ* is an equation *y² = x³ + **a**x + **b***, where *a, b* ∈ *Fₚ* satisfies *4a³ + 27b² **≠** 0*. We write *E/Fₚ* to denote the fact that *E* is defined over *Fₚ*. The condition *4a³ + 27b² **≠** 0* ensures that the equation *x³ + ax + b* does not have a double root. This is because the curve is required to be non-singular, which means that it has no cusps or self-intersections. This is needed to avoid certain degeneracies.\n\nElliptic curve cryptography makes use of elliptic curves in a finite field *Fₚ* , where *p* is a prime number greater than 3. The field is a *p\\*p* square matrix in which the points on the curve are limited to integer coordinates within the field only. This is done using the modulus operation to make the values wrap around when they reach the modulus *p.* All algebraic operations within the field result in another point in the field. The equation of an elliptic curve in a finite field *Fₚ* takes the modular form:\n\n*y² = x³ + ax + b* (mod *p*)\n\nThe secp256k1 curve equation becomes: \\*y² = x³ + 7 \\*(mod *p*)\n\nECC uses points {*x,y*} in the *Fₚ* (*x,y* ∈ \\[0…*p*-1\\]). An elliptic curve over the finite field *Fₚ* consists of a set of integer coordinates {*x,y*} such that 0 ≤ *x* and *y* < *p* that stay on the elliptic curve *y² = x³ + ax + b* (mod *p*).\n\n### Point Arithmetic\n\nWhen two EC points are added, the result is another point on the same EC. This operation is called EC point addition. When we add a point *G* to itself, we get\n\n*G + G* = 2 ⋅ *G*\n\nDoing this again, we get *G + G + G* = 3 ⋅ *G*\n\nThis is how EC point multiplication is defined.\n\nWhen we multiply a point *G* on an EC with an int *k*, we get another point *P* on the same EC. This is a fast operation. *P = k ⋅* G\n\nMultiplying an EC point with 0 gives a special EC point called “point at infinity”.\n\n### Order and cofactor\n\nThe total number of points on an elliptic curve, including the point at infinity, is called its order. An elliptic curve over a finite field can form a finite cyclic algebraic group, which contains all of the curve’s points. In a cyclic group, when two EC points are added or an EC point is multiplied by an integer, the result is another EC point in the same cyclic group (and on the same curve). ECs can be divided into two categories based on their cyclic groupings:\n\n* Some curves form a single cyclic group that holds all their EC points,\n* While others form several non-overlapping cyclic subgroups, where each holds a subset of the curve’s EC points.\n\nIn the latter category, the points on the curve are divided into h cyclic subgroups or partitions, each of which has an order of *r*. The order of the whole group, *n = h \\* r*\n\nThe number of subgroups holding EC points is called the cofactor, *h*.\n\n*h = n / r*, where\n\n* ***n* is the degree of the curve** — or the number of all points on the curve.\n* ***h* is the curve cofactor** — the number of non-overlapping subsets of points that contain all curve points together.\n* ***r* is the order of the subgroups** — the number of points in each subgroup, including the point at infinity for each subgroup.\n\nThe cofactor for the elliptic curve used by Ethereum (secp256k1) is 1.\n\n### \n\n### Generator point\n\nFor elliptic curves over finite fields, the elliptic curve cryptosystems define a special pre-defined (constant) point called generator point or base point. This point can be used to generate any other point in its subgroup over the elliptic curve by multiplying G with some integer in the range \\[0…r\\], where r is the order of the cyclic subgroup.\n\nThe total number of private keys for this curve is determined by the order *r* of the subgroup (which may differ from the order of the curve) obtained from EC generator point *G*.\n\n*r = n / h*\n\nThe elliptic curve domain parameters are chosen carefully to ensure the key space is large enough for certain cryptographic strength. EC subgroups usually have many generator points. Out of these, one is selected carefully, from which all points in the subgroup can be obtained. This point should also be suitable for performance optimization in computations. This generator point is called *G*.\n\nSome points used as generators for the same curve will generate smaller subgroups than others. The smaller a subgroup, the weaker the security it provides — known as “**small subgroup attacks**”. This is also the reason why the subgroup order r is usually chosen as a prime number.\n\n### Private Key, Public Key and Generator Point\n\nIn ECC, when we multiply a fixed EC point G (the generator point) with a certain integer k (the private key), we obtain another EC point P (the public key). It is very fast to calculate P = k \\* G using well-known ECC multiplication algorithms. It will require just a few hundred basic EC operations for 256-bit curves.\n\nCalculating *k = P / G* is extremely slow (infeasible for large values of *k*). This asymmetry — quick multiplication and really slow other operation — is the foundation of ECC’s security strength. This is also known as the ECDLP.\n\n### ECDLP\n\nIn computer science, the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem or ECDLP is defined as: Given an elliptic curve over a finite field Fₚ, a generator point G on the curve, and another point P on the curve, determine the integer k (if it exists) such that P \\* k = G.\n\nExponentiation of integers in group *Zₚ* (field of integers) is analogous to multiplying EC points in group *Fₚ* . ECDLP resembles the discrete logarithm problem in this manner. Many ECC algorithms rely on the ECDLP’s computational difficulties over a carefully chosen field *Fₚ* and elliptic curve, for which there are no efficient algorithms.\n\n### Curve Security Strength\n\nThe fastest known algorithm to solve ECDLP for the key size *k* requires √*k* steps. To achieve a *k*-bit security strength, at least a 2\\**k*-bit curve is needed. Typically, 256-bit elliptic curves (where *p* is a 256-bit value) provide nearly 128-bit security strength.\n\nIn actuality, the strength is slightly lower because:\n\n* The order of the curve *(n)* is usually smaller than the size of the field *(p)*.\n* The curve may have a cofactor (*h*) greater than 1.\n* The number of steps isn’t exactly √*k* but 0.886 \\* √*k* .\n\nAs a result, the secp256k1 curve offers 127.8-bit security.\n\n### Public Key Compression\n\nElliptic curves over a finite field *Fₚ* have at most 2 points for every *x* coordinate– odd *y* and even *y* (shown below for the secp256k1 curve). This property comes from the nature of the elliptic curve equation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-7RD2fALP_4wgCr557XMW.png?height=577&width=577)\n\nDue to this property, an elliptic curve point (and hence an ECC public key) *P* {*x, y*} can be **compressed** as C {*x*, odd/even). We erase the *y* coordinate from the elliptic curve point and represent it using a bit to denote an odd or even *y*. Since ECC public keys are just EC points, they can also be compressed in the same way.\n\nTo **decompress a point**, we first calculate the two possible *y* coordinates using the formulae:\n\n* *y₁ = mod_sqrt(x³ + ax + b, p)*\n* *y₂ = p* − *mod_sqrt(x³ + ax + b, p)*\n\nThe modular square root (mod_sqrt) can be calculated using the [Tonelli–Shanks algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonelli%E2%80%93Shanks_algorithm). We then take the odd or even value from the two, based on the additional parity bit in the compressed representation.\n\nFor example: For the elliptic curve *y² ≡ x³ + 7* (mod 17), the point *P* {10, 15} on it can be compressed as C {10, odd}. To decompress the point, we first calculate the two possible *y* coordinates for *x* = 10 using the formulae above: *y₁* = 2 and *y₂*= 15. We then choose the odd value: *y* = 15. Hence, the decompressed point is {10, 15}.\n\n### Domain Parameters\n\nElliptic curves used in ECC are described using a set of domain parameters, such as curve equation parameters, field parameters, and generator point coordinates. These parameters are defined for a set of named curves in cryptography standards like:\n\n* [SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters](http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf)\n* [NIST FIPS PUB 186–4 Digital Signature Standard (DSS)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf)\n* [Brainpool ECC Standard (RFC-5639)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5639)\n\nAll communicating parties should agree on the EC domain parameters to use ECC. In ECC, elliptic curves over finite fields are used. The modulus *p* and order *n* are taken to be very large integers (Eg: 256 bit), and *n* is usually prime. The finite field of the curve has a size of *p\\*p*, and all EC points are also very large integers. For instance, the domain parameters for secp256k1 are:\n\n* *p* (modulus) = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F\n* *n* (order; size; the count of all possible EC points) = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141\n* *a* (the constant “*a*” in *y² ≡ x³ + ax + b (mod p)*) = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n* *b* (the constant “*b*” in *y² ≡ x³ + ax + b (mod p)*) = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007\n* *g* (the curve generator point *G {x, y}*) = (0x79BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F81798, 0x483ada7726a3c4655da4fbfc0e1108a8fd17b448a68554199c47d08ffb10d4b8)\n* *h* (cofactor, typically 1) = 1\n\n\n---\n\n## Digital Signatures\n\nDigital signatures are cryptographic tools that are used to sign messages and verify message signatures to validate the authenticity of a message. Digital signatures provide:\n\n* **Message authenticity**: proof that the message was created and signed by a specific sender (owner of a private key)\n* **Message integrity**: proof that a message was not altered after it was signed.\n* **Non-repudiation**: the signer cannot deny signing the message once the signature has been created.\n\nDigital signature schemes make use of asymmetric cryptography. Digital signatures provide mathematical proof that a specific private (secret) key corresponding to a certain (non-secret) public key was used to sign the message.\n\n![Role of Key Pair in Digital Signatures](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4YCLpOMI-VashTb2N9A9r.png?height=738&width=1343)\n\nTypically the input message is hashed and then the signature is calculated by the signing algorithm. Most signature algorithms perform some operations on the message hash and the private key in a manner that the result cannot be calculated without the private key. The result from message signing is called the digital signature.\n\nThe corresponding public key is used to verify digital signatures. The signed message is hashed, and the message hash and public key are used to perform some calculations. The outcome of this message verification is a boolean value (valid or invalid signature).\n\n![Digital Signature Signing and Verifying](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T2E7wqImsQXutNpTPt-Dy.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\nThe most common digital signature schemes are based on the difficulty of the Discrete Logarithm Problem. These aren’t quantum-safe, which means a quantum computer might extract the private key from the signature. Quantum-safe signature schemes exist but aren’t frequently employed because of their limitations — lengthy keys and signatures, as well as sluggish performance.\n\nThe digital signature scheme used by Ethereum is ECDSA.\n\n### ECDSA\n\nThe Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm is a cryptographically secure digital signature scheme. It is based on the mathematics of cyclic groups of elliptic curves over finite fields and the ECDLP’s difficulty. ECDSA Sign and Verify make use of EC point multiplication.\n\nECDSA uses **shorter keys and signatures** than RSA to provide the same level of security– a 256-bit ECDSA signature has the same security strength as a 3072-bit RSA signature.\n\n#### ECDSA Sign\n\nThe process of signing a message using ECDSA:\n\n1. Calculate the message **hash**, using a cryptographic hash function (Keccak256 for Ethereum): *h* = hash(*msg*)\n2. Securely generates a **random** number *k* in the range \\[1..*n*-1\\], where *n* is the group order.\n   In the case of **deterministic-ECDSA**, the value *k* is HMAC-derived from *h + sk* (see[ RFC 6979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979#section-3.2))\n3. Calculate the coordinates (x*₁*, y*₁*) for the random point \\*R *using: \\*\\*\\*\n   (x*₁, y₁) *= k* × *G*\n4. Calculate *r =* x*₁* mod *n*. If *r* = 0, go back to step 2.\n5. Calculate the signature proof: *s = k −* 1 × (*h + r* × *sk*)*(mod n)\n   The modular inverse k−*1 (mod *n*) is an integer, such that \n   *k* × *k −* 1 *≡* 1 (mod *n*). If *s* = 0, go back to step 3.\n6. Return the **signature** {***r***, ***s***}.\n\nThe **signature** {***r***, ***s***} is a pair of integers, each in the range \\[1…***n***-1\\]. It comprises the proof *s* as well as an encoding of the random point *R* = *k* × *G*. This confirms that the signer is aware of the message *h* as well as the private key *sk*. The proof ***s*** can be verified using the corresponding *pk*.\n\nECDSA signatures are twice as long as the private key used during the signing process. For 256-bit elliptic curves like secpk256k1, an ECDSA signature is 512 bits long.\n\n**ECDSA Verify**\n\nTo verify an ECDSA signature, we need to provide three inputs to the algorithm:\n\n* The signed message *msg*\n* The signature *{r,s}* — output of the ECDSA Sign algorithm.\n* The public key *pk* corresponds to the private key used to sign the message\n\nThe output of the ECDSA Verify algorithm is a boolean value: valid or invalid signature. This is how the algorithm works:\n\n1. Verify that *r* and *s* are integers in the range \\[1, *n*-1\\]. If not, the signature is invalid.\n2. Calculate the message **hash**, where the hashing algorithm is the one used during signature generation (Keccak256 for Ethereum): *h* = hash(***msg***)\n3. Calculate the modular inverse of the signature proof: *s₁ = s* ⁻*¹* (mod *n*)\n4. Recover the random point used during the signing: *R’ = (h* × *s1)* × *G + (r* × *s1)* × *pk*\n5. Take the x-coordinate from *R’ : r’ = R’ . x*\n6. Check whether the signature is valid by comparing if *r’ == r*\n\nThe basic concept underlying signature verification is to recover the point *R’* using the public key and compare it to the point *R* created at random during the signing procedure.\n\n\n---\n\nWe now know about the state of cryptography in the current PoW Ethereum. But, what changes when we switch to PoS, and why?\n\nStay tuned for the second part of this series for the answer, coming soon.", "timestamp": 1657371645, "digest": "SJwdsUSOBEDOYDdBwIsw46Ma8FfBEy9KTeU3Cskt68g", "contributor": "0x6afeB3d9E380787e7D0a17Fc3CA764Bb885014FA"}

It allows me to spend more time doing this and put out the articles sooner. Thank you!*\n\n\n---\n\nCryptography is a branch of mathematics concerned with the secure transmission and protection of information. It is one of Ethereum’s technological pillars. It safeguards information by encoding it so that only the intended recipients can understand and process the information.\n\nThere are two different types of accounts in Ethereum: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and contracts. EOAs have key pairs consisting of a private key and a public key. Private keys, along with digital signatures and Ethereum addresses, prove the ownership of the funds and assets in EOAs.\n\nAll user interaction with Ethereum is made possible using private keys. A private key uniquely determines an Ethereum address, which represents the intended recipient of a transaction. When you send a transaction on Ethereum, you need to digitally sign a message– this digital signature is also created using the private key. Anyone who has an account’s private key has full control of the funds and assets it holds. Keep your private key to yourself!\n\nHow is a public key derived from a private key? How do we prove ownership of an account without having to reveal our private key? How are digital signatures unique? Well, we need to start with the basics of cryptography to answer these questions. The topics we’ll cover are:\n\n* Cryptography basics and mathematical foundations,\n* Cryptographic hash functions and uses\n* Symmetric, Asymmetric cryptography\n* Elliptic curve cryptography, and\n* Digital Signatures: ECDSA.\n\n***Trigger warning: Math;*** it is optional and there is no test at the end. But give it a few minutes and you’ll understand everything better.\n\n## Cryptography Foundations\n\n### Trapdoor Functions\n\nIn mathematics, we have some functions that are easy to calculate but their inverses aren’t. For example, finding the product of two large prime numbers is straightforward. But given the product of two large primes, it is difficult to find its prime factors.\n\nIf you had some secret information, it’d be easy for you to invert some of these functions. Such functions are called trapdoor functions. For example, if you know one of the prime numbers in the previous example, it is trivial to find the other via simple division. Trapdoor functions are **not used in cryptography** to avoid loopholes in cryptographic protocols. If they were, secret information would be revealed.\n\nAn advanced category of mathematical functions based on elliptic curve arithmetic is used in cryptography. It is easy to find the product of two large prime numbers modulo a prime, but given the result, we can’t find the two prime factors. This is called the [Discrete Logarithm Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) (DLP). DLP over certain groups has no trapdoors– this acts as a foundation for a large number of cryptographic protocols.\n\n### Modular Arithmetic\n\nIn mathematics, [modular arithmetic](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic) is a system of integer arithmetic where numbers wrap around when they reach a certain value, called the **modulus**. The modulo operation returns the remainder when one number is divided by another. For example, 11 mod 3 evaluates to 2 because we get a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 2 when we divide 11 by 3.\n\nFor a positive integer *n*, two integers *a* and *b* are called congruent modulo *n* if *a* and *b* differ by a multiple of *n*. That is, for an integer *k*,\n\n*a* − *b* = *kn*\n\nCongruence modulo *n* is denoted as:\n\n*a* ≡ *b* (mod *n*).\n\nThe parentheses here mean that (mod *n*) applies to the entire equation, and not just the right-hand side. This is different from the binary operation “*a* mod *b”*, which refers to the modulo operation and simply returns the remainder after *a* is divided by *b*.\n\n*a ≡ b* (mod *n*) implies that *a* and *b* have the same remainder when they are divided by *n*. That is,\n\n[split://0x01559B3d778DFce4857D6Faa9f04aaE399025027](split://0x01559B3d778DFce4857D6Faa9f04aaE399025027)\n\n[split://0x01559B3d778DFce4857D6Faa9f04aaE399025027](split://0x01559B3d778DFce4857D6Faa9f04aaE399025027)\n\nwhere *r* is the common remainder such that 0 ≤ *r* < *n*. For example,\n\n38 ≡ 3 (mod 5) holds because 38 — 3 = 35, which is a multiple of 5. 38 and 3 also have the same remainder 3 when divided by 5.\n\nThe DLP can be stated as:\n\n> *a, b* and *m* are three integers\\*.\\* Find an integer *k* such that \\*\\**aᵏ ≡ b (mod m)*, where the greatest common divisor of *a* and *m* is 1.\n\n### Fields\n\nA field is a set *F* with two binary operations on *F* called addition and multiplication, denoted using + and *⋅* respectively. These operations must satisfy the following properties, called the field axioms:\n\n1. **Associativity of Addition and Multiplication:** *a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c,* and *a ⋅ (b ⋅ c) = (a ⋅ b) ⋅ c.*\n2. **Commutativity of Addition and Multiplication:** *a + b = b + a,* and *a ⋅ b = b ⋅ a.*\n3. **Additive and Multiplicative Identity:** there exist two different elements 0 and 1 in *F* such that *a +* 0 *= a* and *a ⋅* 1 *= a*.\n4. **Additive Inverse:** for every *a* in *F*, there exists an element *-a* ∈ *F*, called the additive inverse of *a*, such that *a + (-a) =* 0.\n5. **Multiplicative Inverse:** For any *a* ∈ *F* such that *a ≠* 0, there exists *a⁻ ¹* ∈ *F* called the multiplicative inverse of *a*, such that *a ⋅ a⁻ ¹ =* 1.\n6. **Distributivity of Multiplication Over Addition:** *a ⋅ (b + c) = (a ⋅ b) + (a ⋅ c).*\n\nIn these axioms, *a*, *b* and *c* are arbitrary elements in the field *F*.\n\n[https://twitter.com/howie_hua/status/1533875711466868738?s=20&t=lHwtI2_Gxp5zYhSBsg8GxQ](https://twitter.com/howie_hua/status/1533875711466868738?s=20&t=lHwtI2_Gxp5zYhSBsg8GxQ)\n\n\n---\n\n## Cryptographic Hash Functions\n\nHash functions are used in computer programming to convert text (or other data) to integers. The process of calculating the value of a certain hash function is called hashing. Hashing usually maps distinct inputs to distinct outputs, but there might be collisions sometimes. Since hashing is irreversible by design, there are no quick algorithms for recovering the input message from its hash value.\n\n![Mapping text to integers using a hash function](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CW_bM1FoCirl7hs3Sllaz.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\nIn cryptography, hash functions convert arbitrary-sized input data (e.g. a message) to a fixed-size result (e.g. 256 bits). The result is called a hash value (hash code, message digest, or simply hash). Hash functions utilized in cryptography are called cryptographic hash functions. These are one-way hash functions that are **infeasible to invert**. The likelihood of finding a collision via brute force for a strong cryptographic hash function, like SHA-256, is extremely low. There are no known collisions for most modern strong cryptographic hash functions.\n\n![The output of a cryptographic hash function](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A8n_HfIzpShigFHCvJUeJ.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\nThe **ideal cryptographic hash function** is:\n\n* **Deterministic:** Given a fixed input, the value of the output will never change.\n* **Quick:** Computing the hash for any message should be efficient (linear complexity).\n* **Difficult to Decipher:** A small change in the message will result in an extensive change in the hash value. Hence, we cannot derive any information about the original message from its hash value.\n* **Irreversible:** Deriving an input message from its hash should be computationally infeasible. This implies that using brute force (trial and error) is the best approach for doing so.\n* **Collision Resistant:** Finding two input messages with the same hash should be computationally difficult.\n\nThe Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA) are a family of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. SHA-3 functions are deemed more secure than SHA-2 functions. The SHA-3 family of cryptographic hash algorithms, unlike SHA-2, is not prone to **length extension attacks**\\*.\\* In a length extension attack, a hacker can create a valid new hash by extending an existing one without knowing the original message or the private key used to create the hash.\n\nThe “Keccak” hashes family represents the SHA-3 hashes family and is based on the concept of “[sponge construction](https://keccak.team/sponge_duplex.html#:\\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20cryptography,is%20called%20a%20sponge%20function.)”. Ethereum uses a variant of SHA-256 called Keccak-256.\n\n```\nSHA3–256('hello') = 3338be694f50c5f338814986cdf0686453a888b84f424d792af4b9202398f392\n\nKeccak-256('hello') = 1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8\n\nSHA3–512('hello') = 75d527c368f2efe848ecf6b073a36767800805e9eef2b1857d5f984f036eb6df891d75f72d9b154518c1cd58835286d1da9a38deba3de98b5a53e5ed78a84976\n```\n\n### Random Number Generators\n\nRandomness is crucial in cryptography. For example, we need a private key to access the assets in an Ethereum account. This private key should be randomly generated in a way that no one else can generate it. If a secure random number generator is used, the key will be unpredictable and the system will be secure. Hence, “secure random” simply just means “**unpredictably random**”.\n\nIn computer science, random numbers usually come from [Pseudorandom Number Generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) (PRNGs). The sequence of random numbers generated by a PRNG is deterministic and not truly random, as it is entirely determined by an initial value, called the PRNG’s **seed**. If a PRNG gets hacked, it will generate predictable random numbers. This allows hackers to reveal your private keys, sign malicious messages, and so on. Hence, it is essential to generate “truly random” numbers.\n\n#### CSPRNG\n\nCryptographically Secure PRNGs (CSPRNGs) are used in cryptography to make the generated randomness unpredictable. By definition, CSPRNGs are pseudo-random number generators with properties that make them suitable for use in cryptography. They often combine entropy with PRNG and other approaches. To be a CSPRNG, a PRNG must meet two major requirements:\n\n* Satisfy the **next-bit test**: If someone knows all *k* bits from the start of the PRNGs, they wouldn’t be able to predict the bit *k* **+ 1** with reasonable computing resources.\n* Withstand the **state compromise extensions**: If an attacker guesses the internal state of the PRNG or it is revealed in some way, the attacker should be unable to reconstruct all previous random numbers before the revelation.\n\nThe operating system’s entropy is usually limited. Most cryptographic applications employ CSPRNGs, which “stretch” the OS’s available entropy into more bits needed for cryptographic purposes by using cryptographic hash functions while adhering to the CSPRNG criteria.\n\nMost CSPRNGs use a combination of entropy from the operating system and a high-quality PRNG generator, and they frequently “**reseed**,” which means that when new entropy comes from the OS (for example, from user input, system interruptions, disc I/O, or hardware random generators), the underlying PRNG changes its internal state based on the new entropic bits. The CSPRNG is extremely difficult to predict and analyze due to its continual reseeding.\n\n### PoW Hash Functions\n\nThe majority of Proof of Work (PoW) algorithms generate a hash value greater than a certain threshold, known as **mining difficulty**. Blockchain PoW mining algorithms employ a special class of computationally and **memory-intensive hash functions.** Since hashes are random, miners calculate millions of distinct hashes to determine this hash value. For example, the PoW problem might be defined as:\n\n> find a number *p*, such that the hash(*x + p*) starts with 10 zero bits.\n\n**ASIC-resistance** refers to a cryptocurrency’s protocol and mining algorithms being configured in such a way that employing [ASICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) for mining is either impossible or provides no substantial advantage over standard GPU mining. Blockchains that rely on other methods of reaching consensus (like PoS, dPoS, PoA) are ASIC-resistant by design. ASIC-resistance in PoW blockchains is determined by the implementation of the mining algorithm — Bitcoin is not ASIC-resistant, while Ethereum is. This is due to Ethereum’s adoption of the **ETHash** proof-of-hash function. It’s a memory-intensive hash function, meaning that it needs a lot of RAM to be calculated quickly, making it resistant to ASICs. This is how ETHash works:\n\n* A “**seed**” is computed for each block based on the entire chain until the current block.\n* From the seed, a **16 MB pseudorandom cache** is computed.\n* From the cache, a **1 GB dataset** is extracted to be used in mining.\n* Mining involves hashing together random slices of the dataset.\n\nASIC resistance is desirable– it increases a blockchain’s degree of decentralization and makes mining affordable for everyone. [A small number of large players is bad, and a large number of small players is good](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274).\n\n\n---\n\n## Symmetric Cryptography\n\nSymmetric encryption schemes use the **same secret key** (or password) to encrypt data and decrypt it back to its original form.\n\n![Symmetric key cryptography (simplified)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Cmzh9y4bH1rougsciP5Xg.png?height=738&width=1343)\n\nThe figure here is simplified. Usually, the encryption scheme consists of:\n\n* Password to key derivation algorithm\n* Cipher algorithm\n* Cipher block mode algorithm\n* Message authentication code (MAC) algorithm.\n\nThe secret key used to cipher (encrypt) and decipher (decrypt) data is commonly 128, 192, or 256 bits in length and is sometimes referred to as an encryption key or a shared key because both the sending and receiving parties should know it. Most applications use a password-to-key-derivation scheme to extract a secret key from a certain password because users tend to remember passwords easier than binary data. A 256-bit secret key encoded as a hex string look like:\n\n```\n02c324648931b89e3e8a0fc42c96e8e3be2e42812986573a40d46563bceaf75110\n```\n\n## Asymmetric Cryptography\n\nAsymmetric cryptography or Public Key cryptography utilizes a pair of cryptographically related **public and private keys** to encrypt and decrypt data. If the data is encrypted using a private key, it can be decrypted using the corresponding public key and vice versa. As a result, someone can prove they own a certain private key while just revealing the public key that corresponds to it. RSA and ECC are two widely used public key cryptographic protocols.\n\n![Asymmetric Cryptography](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/120CtjwvC0ko6ttu08eeA.png?height=1166&width=1600)\n\nThe [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29) public-key cryptosystem is based on the math of **modular exponentiation** (numbers raised to a power by modulus) and some additional assumptions, along with the computational difficulties of the integer factorization problem. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is based on the algebraic structure of e**lliptic curves over finite fields** and the complexity of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP).\n\nECC is usually used in conjunction with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECC uses **smaller keys, ciphertexts and signatures** than RSA, and is preferred for most applications. It has been proven mathematically that a 3072-bit RSA key has similar cryptographic strength to a 256-bit ECC key. ECC’s key generation is also significantly faster than RSA’s.\n\nBlockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum use ECC to secure transactions. It is worth noting that neither RSA nor ECC is quantum-safe, which means if someone has a powerful enough quantum computer, they’ll be able to derive the private key from a public key in a matter of seconds. While this is true, it is unlikely that there will be a powerful quantum computer anytime soon(next 5–10 years), and we have already constructed quantum resistance asymmetric cryptography like learning with errors.\n\n### Key Pairs\n\nA pair of keys is used in public key cryptography — a public key and a private key. These keys are **linked mathematically** and are used together as a pair. A user controls their Ethereum account using the private key (like a password), while the public key is used to identify an account, similar to a bank account number. In ECC, the private key is used to calculate the public key, which is used to further derive an Ethereum address. In other cryptosystems (like RSA), the public key and private key are generated together but can’t be determined directly from each other.\n\nA key pair is often generated at random in a secure environment (like a hardware wallet) and the public key is revealed, while the private key is secret and is securely stored in a crypto-wallet and is protected by a password or multi-factor authentication. Keep your private key safe, anon.\n\n*[Randall Munroe](http://xkcd.com) shows the inner workings of the mind of a BAYC owner:*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/efnk3PIxjO9SYzYbRAvRT.png?height=564&width=1466)\n\n\n---\n\n## Elliptic Curve Cryptography\n\nElliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a modern family of public-key cryptography systems, based on the algebraic structures of **elliptic curves over finite fields** and the complexity of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). ECC is the modern natural successor to RSA — it uses smaller keys and signatures than RSA for the same level of security, and provides fast operations (key generation, key agreement, signatures).\n\n![The elliptic curve used by Ethereum and Bitcoin](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vk0gHIm67F2Q43Td7DIQX.png?height=620&width=520)\n\nThe DLP is based on the idea that it is difficult to factor a large integer composed of two large primes. This idea is then extended and modified for ECC protocols as — finding the **discrete logarithm of a random elliptic curve** element w.r.t. a publicly known base point is impossible. The difficulty of the problem is determined by the size of elliptic curve’s field.\n\n### Elliptic Curve Keys\n\nECC keys are integers in the range of the curve’s field size (typically 256-bit integers). Any number in this range is a valid ECC private key. Private key generation is as simple as securely generating a random number within a certain range.\n\nIn ECC, public keys are EC points, which are a pair of integer coordinates {x, y} on a curve. The EC points have special characteristics. They can be reduced to a **single coordinate plus one parity bit** (parity). This compressed public key is a 257-bit integer that corresponds to a 256-bit ECC private key. It is represented in the Ethereum format using 33 bytes (66 hex digits) and is optimized to exactly 257 bits.\n\n### Curves and key length\n\nECC algorithms can use different underlying elliptic curves. These curves that have been adopted in popular cryptography frameworks and security standards have:\n\n* a name : such as secp256k1, Curve25519\n* a field size: this determines the key length\n* security strength:  usually fieldSize / 2 or less\n* performance : operations / sec\n\nIn most applications, the default ECC private key length is **256 bits**.\n\n### Elliptic Curves\n\nAll elliptic curve algorithms use an underlying curve for calculations. They use public-private key pairs, where:\n\n* the private key is an integer, and\n* the public key is a point on the elliptic curve.\n\nBut first, what are elliptic curves?\n\nIn mathematics, elliptic curves are plane algebraic curves consisting of all points {x,y} described by the equation of a general cubic curve.\n\nIn cryptography, elliptic curves are used in a simplified form (Weierstrass form). For a [field characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_%28algebra%29#Case_of_fields) not equal to 2 or 3, the equation can be written as:\n\n*y² = x³ + **a**x + **b***\n\nThis equation when used with different values of ***a*** and ***b***, gives us different curves. For instance, the secp256k1 curve used by Bitcoin and Ethereum uses ***a*** = 0 and ***b*** = 7 :\n\n*y² = x³ + **7***\n\n### Elliptic Curves Over Finite Fields\n\nLet p > 3 be a prime. An elliptic curve *E* defined over *Fₚ* is an equation *y² = x³ + **a**x + **b***, where *a, b* ∈ *Fₚ* satisfies *4a³ + 27b² **≠** 0*. We write *E/Fₚ* to denote the fact that *E* is defined over *Fₚ*. The condition *4a³ + 27b² **≠** 0* ensures that the equation *x³ + ax + b* does not have a double root. This is because the curve is required to be non-singular, which means that it has no cusps or self-intersections. This is needed to avoid certain degeneracies.\n\nElliptic curve cryptography makes use of elliptic curves in a finite field *Fₚ* , where *p* is a prime number greater than 3. The field is a *p\\*p* square matrix in which the points on the curve are limited to integer coordinates within the field only. This is done using the modulus operation to make the values wrap around when they reach the modulus *p.* All algebraic operations within the field result in another point in the field. The equation of an elliptic curve in a finite field *Fₚ* takes the modular form:\n\n*y² = x³ + ax + b* (mod *p*)\n\nThe secp256k1 curve equation becomes: \\*y² = x³ + 7 \\*(mod *p*)\n\nECC uses points {*x,y*} in the *Fₚ* (*x,y* ∈ \\[0…*p*-1\\]). An elliptic curve over the finite field *Fₚ* consists of a set of integer coordinates {*x,y*} such that 0 ≤ *x* and *y* < *p* that stay on the elliptic curve *y² = x³ + ax + b* (mod *p*).\n\n### Point Arithmetic\n\nWhen two EC points are added, the result is another point on the same EC. This operation is called EC point addition. When we add a point *G* to itself, we get\n\n*G + G* = 2 ⋅ *G*\n\nDoing this again, we get *G + G + G* = 3 ⋅ *G*\n\nThis is how EC point multiplication is defined.\n\nWhen we multiply a point *G* on an EC with an int *k*, we get another point *P* on the same EC. This is a fast operation. *P = k ⋅* G\n\nMultiplying an EC point with 0 gives a special EC point called “point at infinity”.\n\n### Order and cofactor\n\nThe total number of points on an elliptic curve, including the point at infinity, is called its order. An elliptic curve over a finite field can form a finite cyclic algebraic group, which contains all of the curve’s points. In a cyclic group, when two EC points are added or an EC point is multiplied by an integer, the result is another EC point in the same cyclic group (and on the same curve). ECs can be divided into two categories based on their cyclic groupings:\n\n* Some curves form a single cyclic group that holds all their EC points,\n* While others form several non-overlapping cyclic subgroups, where each holds a subset of the curve’s EC points.\n\nIn the latter category, the points on the curve are divided into h cyclic subgroups or partitions, each of which has an order of *r*. The order of the whole group, *n = h \\* r*\n\nThe number of subgroups holding EC points is called the cofactor, *h*.\n\n*h = n / r*, where\n\n* ***n* is the degree of the curve** — or the number of all points on the curve.\n* ***h* is the curve cofactor** — the number of non-overlapping subsets of points that contain all curve points together.\n* ***r* is the order of the subgroups** — the number of points in each subgroup, including the point at infinity for each subgroup.\n\nThe cofactor for the elliptic curve used by Ethereum (secp256k1) is 1.\n\n### \n\n### Generator point\n\nFor elliptic curves over finite fields, the elliptic curve cryptosystems define a special pre-defined (constant) point called generator point or base point. This point can be used to generate any other point in its subgroup over the elliptic curve by multiplying G with some integer in the range \\[0…r\\], where r is the order of the cyclic subgroup.\n\nThe total number of private keys for this curve is determined by the order *r* of the subgroup (which may differ from the order of the curve) obtained from EC generator point *G*.\n\n*r = n / h*\n\nThe elliptic curve domain parameters are chosen carefully to ensure the key space is large enough for certain cryptographic strength. EC subgroups usually have many generator points. Out of these, one is selected carefully, from which all points in the subgroup can be obtained. This point should also be suitable for performance optimization in computations. This generator point is called *G*.\n\nSome points used as generators for the same curve will generate smaller subgroups than others. The smaller a subgroup, the weaker the security it provides — known as “**small subgroup attacks**”. This is also the reason why the subgroup order r is usually chosen as a prime number.\n\n### Private Key, Public Key and Generator Point\n\nIn ECC, when we multiply a fixed EC point G (the generator point) with a certain integer k (the private key), we obtain another EC point P (the public key). It is very fast to calculate P = k \\* G using well-known ECC multiplication algorithms. It will require just a few hundred basic EC operations for 256-bit curves.\n\nCalculating *k = P / G* is extremely slow (infeasible for large values of *k*). This asymmetry — quick multiplication and really slow other operation — is the foundation of ECC’s security strength. This is also known as the ECDLP.\n\n### ECDLP\n\nIn computer science, the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem or ECDLP is defined as: Given an elliptic curve over a finite field Fₚ, a generator point G on the curve, and another point P on the curve, determine the integer k (if it exists) such that P \\* k = G.\n\nExponentiation of integers in group *Zₚ* (field of integers) is analogous to multiplying EC points in group *Fₚ* . ECDLP resembles the discrete logarithm problem in this manner. Many ECC algorithms rely on the ECDLP’s computational difficulties over a carefully chosen field *Fₚ* and elliptic curve, for which there are no efficient algorithms.\n\n### Curve Security Strength\n\nThe fastest known algorithm to solve ECDLP for the key size *k* requires √*k* steps. To achieve a *k*-bit security strength, at least a 2\\**k*-bit curve is needed. Typically, 256-bit elliptic curves (where *p* is a 256-bit value) provide nearly 128-bit security strength.\n\nIn actuality, the strength is slightly lower because:\n\n* The order of the curve *(n)* is usually smaller than the size of the field *(p)*.\n* The curve may have a cofactor (*h*) greater than 1.\n* The number of steps isn’t exactly √*k* but 0.886 \\* √*k* .\n\nAs a result, the secp256k1 curve offers 127.8-bit security.\n\n### Public Key Compression\n\nElliptic curves over a finite field *Fₚ* have at most 2 points for every *x* coordinate– odd *y* and even *y* (shown below for the secp256k1 curve). This property comes from the nature of the elliptic curve equation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-7RD2fALP_4wgCr557XMW.png?height=577&width=577)\n\nDue to this property, an elliptic curve point (and hence an ECC public key) *P* {*x, y*} can be **compressed** as C {*x*, odd/even). We erase the *y* coordinate from the elliptic curve point and represent it using a bit to denote an odd or even *y*. Since ECC public keys are just EC points, they can also be compressed in the same way.\n\nTo **decompress a point**, we first calculate the two possible *y* coordinates using the formulae:\n\n* *y₁ = mod_sqrt(x³ + ax + b, p)*\n* *y₂ = p* − *mod_sqrt(x³ + ax + b, p)*\n\nThe modular square root (mod_sqrt) can be calculated using the [Tonelli–Shanks algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonelli%E2%80%93Shanks_algorithm). We then take the odd or even value from the two, based on the additional parity bit in the compressed representation.\n\nFor example: For the elliptic curve *y² ≡ x³ + 7* (mod 17), the point *P* {10, 15} on it can be compressed as C {10, odd}. To decompress the point, we first calculate the two possible *y* coordinates for *x* = 10 using the formulae above: *y₁* = 2 and *y₂*= 15. We then choose the odd value: *y* = 15. Hence, the decompressed point is {10, 15}.\n\n### Domain Parameters\n\nElliptic curves used in ECC are described using a set of domain parameters, such as curve equation parameters, field parameters, and generator point coordinates. These parameters are defined for a set of named curves in cryptography standards like:\n\n* [SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters](http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf)\n* [NIST FIPS PUB 186–4 Digital Signature Standard (DSS)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf)\n* [Brainpool ECC Standard (RFC-5639)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5639)\n\nAll communicating parties should agree on the EC domain parameters to use ECC. In ECC, elliptic curves over finite fields are used. The modulus *p* and order *n* are taken to be very large integers (Eg: 256 bit), and *n* is usually prime. The finite field of the curve has a size of *p\\*p*, and all EC points are also very large integers. For instance, the domain parameters for secp256k1 are:\n\n* *p* (modulus) = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F\n* *n* (order; size; the count of all possible EC points) = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141\n* *a* (the constant “*a*” in *y² ≡ x³ + ax + b (mod p)*) = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n* *b* (the constant “*b*” in *y² ≡ x³ + ax + b (mod p)*) = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007\n* *g* (the curve generator point *G {x, y}*) = (0x79BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F81798, 0x483ada7726a3c4655da4fbfc0e1108a8fd17b448a68554199c47d08ffb10d4b8)\n* *h* (cofactor, typically 1) = 1\n\n\n---\n\n## Digital Signatures\n\nDigital signatures are cryptographic tools that are used to sign messages and verify message signatures to validate the authenticity of a message. Digital signatures provide:\n\n* **Message authenticity**: proof that the message was created and signed by a specific sender (owner of a private key)\n* **Message integrity**: proof that a message was not altered after it was signed.\n* **Non-repudiation**: the signer cannot deny signing the message once the signature has been created.\n\nDigital signature schemes make use of asymmetric cryptography. Digital signatures provide mathematical proof that a specific private (secret) key corresponding to a certain (non-secret) public key was used to sign the message.\n\n![Role of Key Pair in Digital Signatures](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4YCLpOMI-VashTb2N9A9r.png?height=738&width=1343)\n\nTypically the input message is hashed and then the signature is calculated by the signing algorithm. Most signature algorithms perform some operations on the message hash and the private key in a manner that the result cannot be calculated without the private key. The result from message signing is called the digital signature.\n\nThe corresponding public key is used to verify digital signatures. The signed message is hashed, and the message hash and public key are used to perform some calculations. The outcome of this message verification is a boolean value (valid or invalid signature).\n\n![Digital Signature Signing and Verifying](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T2E7wqImsQXutNpTPt-Dy.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\nThe most common digital signature schemes are based on the difficulty of the Discrete Logarithm Problem. These aren’t quantum-safe, which means a quantum computer might extract the private key from the signature. Quantum-safe signature schemes exist but aren’t frequently employed because of their limitations — lengthy keys and signatures, as well as sluggish performance.\n\nThe digital signature scheme used by Ethereum is ECDSA.\n\n### ECDSA\n\nThe Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm is a cryptographically secure digital signature scheme. It is based on the mathematics of cyclic groups of elliptic curves over finite fields and the ECDLP’s difficulty. ECDSA Sign and Verify make use of EC point multiplication.\n\nECDSA uses **shorter keys and signatures** than RSA to provide the same level of security– a 256-bit ECDSA signature has the same security strength as a 3072-bit RSA signature.\n\n#### ECDSA Sign\n\nThe process of signing a message using ECDSA:\n\n1. Calculate the message **hash**, using a cryptographic hash function (Keccak256 for Ethereum): *h* = hash(*msg*)\n2. Securely generates a **random** number *k* in the range \\[1..*n*-1\\], where *n* is the group order.\n   In the case of **deterministic-ECDSA**, the value *k* is HMAC-derived from *h + sk* (see[ RFC 6979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979#section-3.2))\n3. Calculate the coordinates (x*₁*, y*₁*) for the random point \\*R *using: \\*\\*\\*\n   (x*₁, y₁) *= k* × *G*\n4. Calculate *r =* x*₁* mod *n*. If *r* = 0, go back to step 2.\n5. Calculate the signature proof: *s = k −* 1 × (*h + r* × *sk*)*(mod n)\n   The modular inverse k−*1 (mod *n*) is an integer, such that \n   *k* × *k −* 1 *≡* 1 (mod *n*). If *s* = 0, go back to step 3.\n6. Return the **signature** {***r***, ***s***}.\n\nThe **signature** {***r***, ***s***} is a pair of integers, each in the range \\[1…***n***-1\\]. It comprises the proof *s* as well as an encoding of the random point *R* = *k* × *G*. This confirms that the signer is aware of the message *h* as well as the private key *sk*. The proof ***s*** can be verified using the corresponding *pk*.\n\nECDSA signatures are twice as long as the private key used during the signing process. For 256-bit elliptic curves like secpk256k1, an ECDSA signature is 512 bits long.\n\n**ECDSA Verify**\n\nTo verify an ECDSA signature, we need to provide three inputs to the algorithm:\n\n* The signed message *msg*\n* The signature *{r,s}* — output of the ECDSA Sign algorithm.\n* The public key *pk* corresponds to the private key used to sign the message\n\nThe output of the ECDSA Verify algorithm is a boolean value: valid or invalid signature. This is how the algorithm works:\n\n1. Verify that *r* and *s* are integers in the range \\[1, *n*-1\\]. If not, the signature is invalid.\n2. Calculate the message **hash**, where the hashing algorithm is the one used during signature generation (Keccak256 for Ethereum): *h* = hash(***msg***)\n3. Calculate the modular inverse of the signature proof: *s₁ = s* ⁻*¹* (mod *n*)\n4. Recover the random point used during the signing: *R’ = (h* × *s1)* × *G + (r* × *s1)* × *pk*\n5. Take the x-coordinate from *R’ : r’ = R’ . x*\n6. Check whether the signature is valid by comparing if *r’ == r*\n\nThe basic concept underlying signature verification is to recover the point *R’* using the public key and compare it to the point *R* created at random during the signing procedure.\n\n\n---\n\nWe now know about the state of cryptography in the current PoW Ethereum. But, what changes when we switch to PoS, and why?\n\nStay tuned for the second part of this series for the answer, coming soon.", "timestamp": 1657371946, "digest": "SJwdsUSOBEDOYDdBwIsw46Ma8FfBEy9KTeU3Cskt68g", "contributor": "0x6afeB3d9E380787e7D0a17Fc3CA764Bb885014FA"}

It allows me to spend more time doing this and put out the articles sooner. Thank you!*\n\n\n---\n\nCryptography is a branch of mathematics concerned with the secure transmission and protection of information. It is one of Ethereum’s technological pillars. It safeguards information by encoding it so that only the intended recipients can understand and process the information.\n\nThere are two different types of accounts in Ethereum: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and contracts. EOAs have key pairs consisting of a private key and a public key. Private keys, along with digital signatures and Ethereum addresses, prove the ownership of the funds and assets in EOAs.\n\nAll user interaction with Ethereum is made possible using private keys. A private key uniquely determines an Ethereum address, which represents the intended recipient of a transaction. When you send a transaction on Ethereum, you need to digitally sign a message– this digital signature is also created using the private key. Anyone who has an account’s private key has full control of the funds and assets it holds. Keep your private key to yourself!\n\nHow is a public key derived from a private key? How do we prove ownership of an account without having to reveal our private key? How are digital signatures unique? Well, we need to start with the basics of cryptography to answer these questions. The topics we’ll cover are:\n\n* Cryptography basics and mathematical foundations,\n* Cryptographic hash functions and uses\n* Symmetric, Asymmetric cryptography\n* Elliptic curve cryptography, and\n* Digital Signatures: ECDSA.\n\n***Trigger warning: Math;*** it is optional and there is no test at the end. But give it a few minutes and you’ll understand everything better.\n\n## Cryptography Foundations\n\n### Trapdoor Functions\n\nIn mathematics, we have some functions that are easy to calculate but their inverses aren’t. For example, finding the product of two large prime numbers is straightforward. But given the product of two large primes, it is difficult to find its prime factors.\n\nIf you had some secret information, it’d be easy for you to invert some of these functions. Such functions are called trapdoor functions. For example, if you know one of the prime numbers in the previous example, it is trivial to find the other via simple division. Trapdoor functions are **not used in cryptography** to avoid loopholes in cryptographic protocols. If they were, secret information would be revealed.\n\nAn advanced category of mathematical functions based on elliptic curve arithmetic is used in cryptography. It is easy to find the product of two large prime numbers modulo a prime, but given the result, we can’t find the two prime factors. This is called the [Discrete Logarithm Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) (DLP). DLP over certain groups has no trapdoors– this acts as a foundation for a large number of cryptographic protocols.\n\n### Modular Arithmetic\n\nIn mathematics, [modular arithmetic](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic) is a system of integer arithmetic where numbers wrap around when they reach a certain value, called the **modulus**. The modulo operation returns the remainder when one number is divided by another. For example, 11 mod 3 evaluates to 2 because we get a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 2 when we divide 11 by 3.\n\nFor a positive integer *n*, two integers *a* and *b* are called congruent modulo *n* if *a* and *b* differ by a multiple of *n*. That is, for an integer *k*,\n\n*a* − *b* = *kn*\n\nCongruence modulo *n* is denoted as:\n\n*a* ≡ *b* (mod *n*).\n\nThe parentheses here mean that (mod *n*) applies to the entire equation, and not just the right-hand side. This is different from the binary operation “*a* mod *b”*, which refers to the modulo operation and simply returns the remainder after *a* is divided by *b*.\n\n*a ≡ b* (mod *n*) implies that *a* and *b* have the same remainder when they are divided by *n*. That is,\n\n[split://0x01559B3d778DFce4857D6Faa9f04aaE399025027](split://0x01559B3d778DFce4857D6Faa9f04aaE399025027)\n\n[split://0x01559B3d778DFce4857D6Faa9f04aaE399025027](split://0x01559B3d778DFce4857D6Faa9f04aaE399025027)\n\nwhere *r* is the common remainder such that 0 ≤ *r* < *n*. For example,\n\n38 ≡ 3 (mod 5) holds because 38 — 3 = 35, which is a multiple of 5. 38 and 3 also have the same remainder 3 when divided by 5.\n\nThe DLP can be stated as:\n\n> *a, b* and *m* are three integers. Find an integer *k* such that *aᵏ ≡ b (mod m)*, where the greatest common divisor of *a* and *m* is 1.\n\n### Fields\n\nA field is a set *F* with two binary operations on *F* called addition and multiplication, denoted using + and *⋅* respectively. These operations must satisfy the following properties, called the field axioms:\n\n1. **Associativity of Addition and Multiplication:** *a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c,* and *a ⋅ (b ⋅ c) = (a ⋅ b) ⋅ c.*\n2. **Commutativity of Addition and Multiplication:** *a + b = b + a,* and *a ⋅ b = b ⋅ a.*\n3. **Additive and Multiplicative Identity:** there exist two different elements 0 and 1 in *F* such that *a +* 0 *= a* and *a ⋅* 1 *= a*.\n4. **Additive Inverse:** for every *a* in *F*, there exists an element *-a* ∈ *F*, called the additive inverse of *a*, such that *a + (-a) =* 0.\n5. **Multiplicative Inverse:** For any *a* ∈ *F* such that *a ≠* 0, there exists *a⁻ ¹* ∈ *F* called the multiplicative inverse of *a*, such that *a ⋅ a⁻ ¹ =* 1.\n6. **Distributivity of Multiplication Over Addition:** *a ⋅ (b + c) = (a ⋅ b) + (a ⋅ c).*\n\nIn these axioms, *a*, *b* and *c* are arbitrary elements in the field *F*.\n\n[https://twitter.com/howie_hua/status/1533875711466868738?s=20&t=lHwtI2_Gxp5zYhSBsg8GxQ](https://twitter.com/howie_hua/status/1533875711466868738?s=20&t=lHwtI2_Gxp5zYhSBsg8GxQ)\n\n\n---\n\n## Cryptographic Hash Functions\n\nHash functions are used in computer programming to convert text (or other data) to integers. The process of calculating the value of a certain hash function is called hashing. Hashing usually maps distinct inputs to distinct outputs, but there might be collisions sometimes. Since hashing is irreversible by design, there are no quick algorithms for recovering the input message from its hash value.\n\n![Mapping text to integers using a hash function](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CW_bM1FoCirl7hs3Sllaz.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\nIn cryptography, hash functions convert arbitrary-sized input data (e.g. a message) to a fixed-size result (e.g. 256 bits). The result is called a hash value (hash code, message digest, or simply hash). Hash functions utilized in cryptography are called cryptographic hash functions. These are one-way hash functions that are **infeasible to invert**. The likelihood of finding a collision via brute force for a strong cryptographic hash function, like SHA-256, is extremely low. There are no known collisions for most modern strong cryptographic hash functions.\n\n![The output of a cryptographic hash function](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A8n_HfIzpShigFHCvJUeJ.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\nThe **ideal cryptographic hash function** is:\n\n* **Deterministic:** Given a fixed input, the value of the output will never change.\n* **Quick:** Computing the hash for any message should be efficient (linear complexity).\n* **Difficult to Decipher:** A small change in the message will result in an extensive change in the hash value. Hence, we cannot derive any information about the original message from its hash value.\n* **Irreversible:** Deriving an input message from its hash should be computationally infeasible. This implies that using brute force (trial and error) is the best approach for doing so.\n* **Collision Resistant:** Finding two input messages with the same hash should be computationally difficult.\n\nThe Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA) are a family of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. SHA-3 functions are deemed more secure than SHA-2 functions. The SHA-3 family of cryptographic hash algorithms, unlike SHA-2, is not prone to **length extension attacks**\\*.\\* In a length extension attack, a hacker can create a valid new hash by extending an existing one without knowing the original message or the private key used to create the hash.\n\nThe “Keccak” hashes family represents the SHA-3 hashes family and is based on the concept of “[sponge construction](https://keccak.team/sponge_duplex.html#:\\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20cryptography,is%20called%20a%20sponge%20function.)”. Ethereum uses a variant of SHA-256 called Keccak-256.\n\n```\nSHA3–256('hello') = 3338be694f50c5f338814986cdf0686453a888b84f424d792af4b9202398f392\n\nKeccak-256('hello') = 1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8\n\nSHA3–512('hello') = 75d527c368f2efe848ecf6b073a36767800805e9eef2b1857d5f984f036eb6df891d75f72d9b154518c1cd58835286d1da9a38deba3de98b5a53e5ed78a84976\n```\n\n### Random Number Generators\n\nRandomness is crucial in cryptography. For example, we need a private key to access the assets in an Ethereum account. This private key should be randomly generated in a way that no one else can generate it. If a secure random number generator is used, the key will be unpredictable and the system will be secure. Hence, “secure random” simply just means “**unpredictably random**”.\n\nIn computer science, random numbers usually come from [Pseudorandom Number Generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) (PRNGs). The sequence of random numbers generated by a PRNG is deterministic and not truly random, as it is entirely determined by an initial value, called the PRNG’s **seed**. If a PRNG gets hacked, it will generate predictable random numbers. This allows hackers to reveal your private keys, sign malicious messages, and so on. Hence, it is essential to generate “truly random” numbers.\n\n#### CSPRNG\n\nCryptographically Secure PRNGs (CSPRNGs) are used in cryptography to make the generated randomness unpredictable. By definition, CSPRNGs are pseudo-random number generators with properties that make them suitable for use in cryptography. They often combine entropy with PRNG and other approaches. To be a CSPRNG, a PRNG must meet two major requirements:\n\n* Satisfy the **next-bit test**: If someone knows all *k* bits from the start of the PRNGs, they wouldn’t be able to predict the bit *k* **+ 1** with reasonable computing resources.\n* Withstand the **state compromise extensions**: If an attacker guesses the internal state of the PRNG or it is revealed in some way, the attacker should be unable to reconstruct all previous random numbers before the revelation.\n\nThe operating system’s entropy is usually limited. Most cryptographic applications employ CSPRNGs, which “stretch” the OS’s available entropy into more bits needed for cryptographic purposes by using cryptographic hash functions while adhering to the CSPRNG criteria.\n\nMost CSPRNGs use a combination of entropy from the operating system and a high-quality PRNG generator, and they frequently “**reseed**,” which means that when new entropy comes from the OS (for example, from user input, system interruptions, disc I/O, or hardware random generators), the underlying PRNG changes its internal state based on the new entropic bits. The CSPRNG is extremely difficult to predict and analyze due to its continual reseeding.\n\n### PoW Hash Functions\n\nThe majority of Proof of Work (PoW) algorithms generate a hash value greater than a certain threshold, known as **mining difficulty**. Blockchain PoW mining algorithms employ a special class of computationally and **memory-intensive hash functions.** Since hashes are random, miners calculate millions of distinct hashes to determine this hash value. For example, the PoW problem might be defined as:\n\n> find a number *p*, such that the hash(*x + p*) starts with 10 zero bits.\n\n**ASIC-resistance** refers to a cryptocurrency’s protocol and mining algorithms being configured in such a way that employing [ASICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) for mining is either impossible or provides no substantial advantage over standard GPU mining. Blockchains that rely on other methods of reaching consensus (like PoS, dPoS, PoA) are ASIC-resistant by design. ASIC-resistance in PoW blockchains is determined by the implementation of the mining algorithm — Bitcoin is not ASIC-resistant, while Ethereum is. This is due to Ethereum’s adoption of the **ETHash** proof-of-hash function. It’s a memory-intensive hash function, meaning that it needs a lot of RAM to be calculated quickly, making it resistant to ASICs. This is how ETHash works:\n\n* A “**seed**” is computed for each block based on the entire chain until the current block.\n* From the seed, a **16 MB pseudorandom cache** is computed.\n* From the cache, a **1 GB dataset** is extracted to be used in mining.\n* Mining involves hashing together random slices of the dataset.\n\nASIC resistance is desirable– it increases a blockchain’s degree of decentralization and makes mining affordable for everyone. [A small number of large players is bad, and a large number of small players is good](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274).\n\n\n---\n\n## Symmetric Cryptography\n\nSymmetric encryption schemes use the **same secret key** (or password) to encrypt data and decrypt it back to its original form.\n\n![Symmetric key cryptography (simplified)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Cmzh9y4bH1rougsciP5Xg.png?height=738&width=1343)\n\nThe figure here is simplified. Usually, the encryption scheme consists of:\n\n* Password to key derivation algorithm\n* Cipher algorithm\n* Cipher block mode algorithm\n* Message authentication code (MAC) algorithm.\n\nThe secret key used to cipher (encrypt) and decipher (decrypt) data is commonly 128, 192, or 256 bits in length and is sometimes referred to as an encryption key or a shared key because both the sending and receiving parties should know it. Most applications use a password-to-key-derivation scheme to extract a secret key from a certain password because users tend to remember passwords easier than binary data. A 256-bit secret key encoded as a hex string look like:\n\n```\n02c324648931b89e3e8a0fc42c96e8e3be2e42812986573a40d46563bceaf75110\n```\n\n## Asymmetric Cryptography\n\nAsymmetric cryptography or Public Key cryptography utilizes a pair of cryptographically related **public and private keys** to encrypt and decrypt data. If the data is encrypted using a private key, it can be decrypted using the corresponding public key and vice versa. As a result, someone can prove they own a certain private key while just revealing the public key that corresponds to it. RSA and ECC are two widely used public key cryptographic protocols.\n\n![Asymmetric Cryptography](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/120CtjwvC0ko6ttu08eeA.png?height=1166&width=1600)\n\nThe [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29) public-key cryptosystem is based on the math of **modular exponentiation** (numbers raised to a power by modulus) and some additional assumptions, along with the computational difficulties of the integer factorization problem. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is based on the algebraic structure of e**lliptic curves over finite fields** and the complexity of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP).\n\nECC is usually used in conjunction with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECC uses **smaller keys, ciphertexts and signatures** than RSA, and is preferred for most applications. It has been proven mathematically that a 3072-bit RSA key has similar cryptographic strength to a 256-bit ECC key. ECC’s key generation is also significantly faster than RSA’s.\n\nBlockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum use ECC to secure transactions. It is worth noting that neither RSA nor ECC is quantum-safe, which means if someone has a powerful enough quantum computer, they’ll be able to derive the private key from a public key in a matter of seconds. While this is true, it is unlikely that there will be a powerful quantum computer anytime soon(next 5–10 years), and we have already constructed quantum resistance asymmetric cryptography like learning with errors.\n\n### Key Pairs\n\nA pair of keys is used in public key cryptography — a public key and a private key. These keys are **linked mathematically** and are used together as a pair. A user controls their Ethereum account using the private key (like a password), while the public key is used to identify an account, similar to a bank account number. In ECC, the private key is used to calculate the public key, which is used to further derive an Ethereum address. In other cryptosystems (like RSA), the public key and private key are generated together but can’t be determined directly from each other.\n\nA key pair is often generated at random in a secure environment (like a hardware wallet) and the public key is revealed, while the private key is secret and is securely stored in a crypto-wallet and is protected by a password or multi-factor authentication. Keep your private key safe, anon.\n\n*[Randall Munroe](http://xkcd.com) shows the inner workings of the mind of a BAYC owner:*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/efnk3PIxjO9SYzYbRAvRT.png?height=564&width=1466)\n\n\n---\n\n## Elliptic Curve Cryptography\n\nElliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a modern family of public-key cryptography systems, based on the algebraic structures of **elliptic curves over finite fields** and the complexity of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). ECC is the modern natural successor to RSA — it uses smaller keys and signatures than RSA for the same level of security, and provides fast operations (key generation, key agreement, signatures).\n\n![The elliptic curve used by Ethereum and Bitcoin](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vk0gHIm67F2Q43Td7DIQX.png?height=620&width=520)\n\nThe DLP is based on the idea that it is difficult to factor a large integer composed of two large primes. This idea is then extended and modified for ECC protocols as — finding the **discrete logarithm of a random elliptic curve** element w.r.t. a publicly known base point is impossible. The difficulty of the problem is determined by the size of elliptic curve’s field.\n\n### Elliptic Curve Keys\n\nECC keys are integers in the range of the curve’s field size (typically 256-bit integers). Any number in this range is a valid ECC private key. Private key generation is as simple as securely generating a random number within a certain range.\n\nIn ECC, public keys are EC points, which are a pair of integer coordinates {x, y} on a curve. The EC points have special characteristics. They can be reduced to a **single coordinate plus one parity bit** (parity). This compressed public key is a 257-bit integer that corresponds to a 256-bit ECC private key. It is represented in the Ethereum format using 33 bytes (66 hex digits) and is optimized to exactly 257 bits.\n\n### Curves and key length\n\nECC algorithms can use different underlying elliptic curves. These curves that have been adopted in popular cryptography frameworks and security standards have:\n\n* a name : such as secp256k1, Curve25519\n* a field size: this determines the key length\n* security strength:  usually fieldSize / 2 or less\n* performance : operations / sec\n\nIn most applications, the default ECC private key length is **256 bits**.\n\n### Elliptic Curves\n\nAll elliptic curve algorithms use an underlying curve for calculations. They use public-private key pairs, where:\n\n* the private key is an integer, and\n* the public key is a point on the elliptic curve.\n\nBut first, what are elliptic curves?\n\nIn mathematics, elliptic curves are plane algebraic curves consisting of all points {x,y} described by the equation of a general cubic curve.\n\nIn cryptography, elliptic curves are used in a simplified form (Weierstrass form). For a [field characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_%28algebra%29#Case_of_fields) not equal to 2 or 3, the equation can be written as:\n\n*y² = x³ + **a**x + **b***\n\nThis equation when used with different values of ***a*** and ***b***, gives us different curves. For instance, the secp256k1 curve used by Bitcoin and Ethereum uses ***a*** = 0 and ***b*** = 7 :\n\n*y² = x³ + **7***\n\n### Elliptic Curves Over Finite Fields\n\nLet p > 3 be a prime. An elliptic curve *E* defined over *Fₚ* is an equation *y² = x³ + **a**x + **b***, where *a, b* ∈ *Fₚ* satisfies *4a³ + 27b² **≠** 0*. We write *E/Fₚ* to denote the fact that *E* is defined over *Fₚ*. The condition *4a³ + 27b² **≠** 0* ensures that the equation *x³ + ax + b* does not have a double root. This is because the curve is required to be non-singular, which means that it has no cusps or self-intersections. This is needed to avoid certain degeneracies.\n\nElliptic curve cryptography makes use of elliptic curves in a finite field *Fₚ* , where *p* is a prime number greater than 3. The field is a *p\\*p* square matrix in which the points on the curve are limited to integer coordinates within the field only. This is done using the modulus operation to make the values wrap around when they reach the modulus *p.* All algebraic operations within the field result in another point in the field. The equation of an elliptic curve in a finite field *Fₚ* takes the modular form:\n\n*y² = x³ + ax + b* (mod *p*)\n\nThe secp256k1 curve equation becomes: \\*y² = x³ + 7 \\*(mod *p*)\n\nECC uses points {*x,y*} in the *Fₚ* (*x,y* ∈ \\[0…*p*-1\\]). An elliptic curve over the finite field *Fₚ* consists of a set of integer coordinates {*x,y*} such that 0 ≤ *x* and *y* < *p* that stay on the elliptic curve *y² = x³ + ax + b* (mod *p*).\n\n### Point Arithmetic\n\nWhen two EC points are added, the result is another point on the same EC. This operation is called EC point addition. When we add a point *G* to itself, we get\n\n*G + G* = 2 ⋅ *G*\n\nDoing this again, we get *G + G + G* = 3 ⋅ *G*\n\nThis is how EC point multiplication is defined.\n\nWhen we multiply a point *G* on an EC with an int *k*, we get another point *P* on the same EC. This is a fast operation. *P = k ⋅* G\n\nMultiplying an EC point with 0 gives a special EC point called “point at infinity”.\n\n### Order and cofactor\n\nThe total number of points on an elliptic curve, including the point at infinity, is called its order. An elliptic curve over a finite field can form a finite cyclic algebraic group, which contains all of the curve’s points. In a cyclic group, when two EC points are added or an EC point is multiplied by an integer, the result is another EC point in the same cyclic group (and on the same curve). ECs can be divided into two categories based on their cyclic groupings:\n\n* Some curves form a single cyclic group that holds all their EC points,\n* While others form several non-overlapping cyclic subgroups, where each holds a subset of the curve’s EC points.\n\nIn the latter category, the points on the curve are divided into h cyclic subgroups or partitions, each of which has an order of *r*. The order of the whole group, *n = h \\* r*\n\nThe number of subgroups holding EC points is called the cofactor, *h*.\n\n*h = n / r*, where\n\n* ***n* is the degree of the curve** — or the number of all points on the curve.\n* ***h* is the curve cofactor** — the number of non-overlapping subsets of points that contain all curve points together.\n* ***r* is the order of the subgroups** — the number of points in each subgroup, including the point at infinity for each subgroup.\n\nThe cofactor for the elliptic curve used by Ethereum (secp256k1) is 1.\n\n### \n\n### Generator point\n\nFor elliptic curves over finite fields, the elliptic curve cryptosystems define a special pre-defined (constant) point called generator point or base point. This point can be used to generate any other point in its subgroup over the elliptic curve by multiplying G with some integer in the range \\[0…r\\], where r is the order of the cyclic subgroup.\n\nThe total number of private keys for this curve is determined by the order *r* of the subgroup (which may differ from the order of the curve) obtained from EC generator point *G*.\n\n*r = n / h*\n\nThe elliptic curve domain parameters are chosen carefully to ensure the key space is large enough for certain cryptographic strength. EC subgroups usually have many generator points. Out of these, one is selected carefully, from which all points in the subgroup can be obtained. This point should also be suitable for performance optimization in computations. This generator point is called *G*.\n\nSome points used as generators for the same curve will generate smaller subgroups than others. The smaller a subgroup, the weaker the security it provides — known as “**small subgroup attacks**”. This is also the reason why the subgroup order r is usually chosen as a prime number.\n\n### Private Key, Public Key and Generator Point\n\nIn ECC, when we multiply a fixed EC point G (the generator point) with a certain integer k (the private key), we obtain another EC point P (the public key). It is very fast to calculate P = k \\* G using well-known ECC multiplication algorithms. It will require just a few hundred basic EC operations for 256-bit curves.\n\nCalculating *k = P / G* is extremely slow (infeasible for large values of *k*). This asymmetry — quick multiplication and really slow other operation — is the foundation of ECC’s security strength. This is also known as the ECDLP.\n\n### ECDLP\n\nIn computer science, the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem or ECDLP is defined as: Given an elliptic curve over a finite field Fₚ, a generator point G on the curve, and another point P on the curve, determine the integer k (if it exists) such that P \\* k = G.\n\nExponentiation of integers in group *Zₚ* (field of integers) is analogous to multiplying EC points in group *Fₚ* . ECDLP resembles the discrete logarithm problem in this manner. Many ECC algorithms rely on the ECDLP’s computational difficulties over a carefully chosen field *Fₚ* and elliptic curve, for which there are no efficient algorithms.\n\n### Curve Security Strength\n\nThe fastest known algorithm to solve ECDLP for the key size *k* requires √*k* steps. To achieve a *k*-bit security strength, at least a 2\\**k*-bit curve is needed. Typically, 256-bit elliptic curves (where *p* is a 256-bit value) provide nearly 128-bit security strength.\n\nIn actuality, the strength is slightly lower because:\n\n* The order of the curve *(n)* is usually smaller than the size of the field *(p)*.\n* The curve may have a cofactor (*h*) greater than 1.\n* The number of steps isn’t exactly √*k* but 0.886 \\* √*k* .\n\nAs a result, the secp256k1 curve offers 127.8-bit security.\n\n### Public Key Compression\n\nElliptic curves over a finite field *Fₚ* have at most 2 points for every *x* coordinate– odd *y* and even *y* (shown below for the secp256k1 curve). This property comes from the nature of the elliptic curve equation.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-7RD2fALP_4wgCr557XMW.png?height=577&width=577)\n\nDue to this property, an elliptic curve point (and hence an ECC public key) *P* {*x, y*} can be **compressed** as C {*x*, odd/even). We erase the *y* coordinate from the elliptic curve point and represent it using a bit to denote an odd or even *y*. Since ECC public keys are just EC points, they can also be compressed in the same way.\n\nTo **decompress a point**, we first calculate the two possible *y* coordinates using the formulae:\n\n* *y₁ = mod_sqrt(x³ + ax + b, p)*\n* *y₂ = p* − *mod_sqrt(x³ + ax + b, p)*\n\nThe modular square root (mod_sqrt) can be calculated using the [Tonelli–Shanks algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonelli%E2%80%93Shanks_algorithm). We then take the odd or even value from the two, based on the additional parity bit in the compressed representation.\n\nFor example: For the elliptic curve *y² ≡ x³ + 7* (mod 17), the point *P* {10, 15} on it can be compressed as C {10, odd}. To decompress the point, we first calculate the two possible *y* coordinates for *x* = 10 using the formulae above: *y₁* = 2 and *y₂*= 15. We then choose the odd value: *y* = 15. Hence, the decompressed point is {10, 15}.\n\n### Domain Parameters\n\nElliptic curves used in ECC are described using a set of domain parameters, such as curve equation parameters, field parameters, and generator point coordinates. These parameters are defined for a set of named curves in cryptography standards like:\n\n* [SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters](http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf)\n* [NIST FIPS PUB 186–4 Digital Signature Standard (DSS)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf)\n* [Brainpool ECC Standard (RFC-5639)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5639)\n\nAll communicating parties should agree on the EC domain parameters to use ECC. In ECC, elliptic curves over finite fields are used. The modulus *p* and order *n* are taken to be very large integers (Eg: 256 bit), and *n* is usually prime.

Digital signatures provide:\n\n* **Message authenticity**: proof that the message was created and signed by a specific sender (owner of a private key)\n* **Message integrity**: proof that a message was not altered after it was signed.\n* **Non-repudiation**: the signer cannot deny signing the message once the signature has been created.\n\nDigital signature schemes make use of asymmetric cryptography. Digital signatures provide mathematical proof that a specific private (secret) key corresponding to a certain (non-secret) public key was used to sign the message.\n\n![Role of Key Pair in Digital Signatures](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4YCLpOMI-VashTb2N9A9r.png?height=738&width=1343)\n\nTypically the input message is hashed and then the signature is calculated by the signing algorithm. Most signature algorithms perform some operations on the message hash and the private key in a manner that the result cannot be calculated without the private key. The result from message signing is called the digital signature.\n\nThe corresponding public key is used to verify digital signatures. The signed message is hashed, and the message hash and public key are used to perform some calculations. The outcome of this message verification is a boolean value (valid or invalid signature).\n\n![Digital Signature Signing and Verifying](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T2E7wqImsQXutNpTPt-Dy.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\nThe most common digital signature schemes are based on the difficulty of the Discrete Logarithm Problem. These aren’t quantum-safe, which means a quantum computer might extract the private key from the signature. Quantum-safe signature schemes exist but aren’t frequently employed because of their limitations — lengthy keys and signatures, as well as sluggish performance.\n\nThe digital signature scheme used by Ethereum is ECDSA.\n\n### ECDSA\n\nThe Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm is a cryptographically secure digital signature scheme. It is based on the mathematics of cyclic groups of elliptic curves over finite fields and the ECDLP’s difficulty. ECDSA Sign and Verify make use of EC point multiplication.\n\nECDSA uses **shorter keys and signatures** than RSA to provide the same level of security– a 256-bit ECDSA signature has the same security strength as a 3072-bit RSA signature.\n\n#### ECDSA Sign\n\nThe process of signing a message using ECDSA:\n\n1. Calculate the message **hash**, using a cryptographic hash function (Keccak256 for Ethereum): *h* = hash(*msg*)\n2. Securely generates a **random** number *k* in the range \\[1..*n*-1\\], where *n* is the group order.\n   In the case of **deterministic-ECDSA**, the value *k* is HMAC-derived from *h + sk* (see[ RFC 6979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979#section-3.2))\n3. Calculate the coordinates (x*₁*, y*₁*) for the random point \\*R *using: \\*\\*\\*\n   (x*₁, y₁) *= k* × *G*\n4. Calculate *r =* x*₁* mod *n*. If *r* = 0, go back to step 2.\n5. Calculate the signature proof: *s = k −* 1 × (*h + r* × *sk*)*(mod n)\n   The modular inverse k−*1 (mod *n*) is an integer, such that \n   *k* × *k −* 1 *≡* 1 (mod *n*). If *s* = 0, go back to step 3.\n6. Return the **signature** {***r***, ***s***}.\n\nThe **signature** {***r***, ***s***} is a pair of integers, each in the range \\[1…***n***-1\\]. It comprises the proof *s* as well as an encoding of the random point *R* = *k* × *G*. This confirms that the signer is aware of the message *h* as well as the private key *sk*. The proof ***s*** can be verified using the corresponding *pk*.\n\nECDSA signatures are twice as long as the private key used during the signing process. For 256-bit elliptic curves like secpk256k1, an ECDSA signature is 512 bits long.\n\n**ECDSA Verify**\n\nTo verify an ECDSA signature, we need to provide three inputs to the algorithm:\n\n* The signed message *msg*\n* The signature *{r,s}* — output of the ECDSA Sign algorithm.\n* The public key *pk* corresponds to the private key used to sign the message\n\nThe output of the ECDSA Verify algorithm is a boolean value: valid or invalid signature. This is how the algorithm works:\n\n1. Verify that *r* and *s* are integers in the range \\[1, *n*-1\\]. If not, the signature is invalid.\n2. Calculate the message **hash**, where the hashing algorithm is the one used during signature generation (Keccak256 for Ethereum): *h* = hash(***msg***)\n3. Calculate the modular inverse of the signature proof: *s₁ = s* ⁻*¹* (mod *n*)\n4. Recover the random point used during the signing: *R’ = (h* × *s1)* × *G + (r* × *s1)* × *pk*\n5. Take the x-coordinate from *R’ : r’ = R’ . x*\n6. Check whether the signature is valid by comparing if *r’ == r*\n\nThe basic concept underlying signature verification is to recover the point *R’* using the public key and compare it to the point *R* created at random during the signing procedure.\n\n\n---\n\nWe now know about the state of cryptography in the current PoW Ethereum.

{"id": "_GMCAvAPbm5edrTrTUFoJA5YoziQ-4Kbn0z-NWAagB4", "title": "BLS Signature Aggregation: Under the Hood", "body": "*This is the second part of a series of articles explaining how cryptography in Ethereum works. The article assumes prior knowledge about Elliptic Curve Cryptography covered in the [previous article](https://mirror.xyz/0x6afeB3d9E380787e7D0a17Fc3CA764Bb885014FA/SJwdsUSOBEDOYDdBwIsw46Ma8FfBEy9KTeU3Cskt68g). We cover the absolute basics of BLS signatures and how their aggregation works.*\n\n\n---\n\nDigital signatures play a big role in blockchains. A message that is digitally signed guarantees two things:\n\n* **Message authenticity:** Evidence that a specific sender (owner of a private key) has created and signed the message.\n* **Message integrity:** Evidence that a message has not been tampered with after it was signed.\n\nDigital signatures aren't new and they've been there since the dawn of public key cryptography. However, recent advances in [Pairing-Based Cryptography](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/\\~ajmeneze/publications/pairings.pdf) have had a significant impact on the Consensus Layer's design.\n\nA digital signature is used every time a user sends a transaction on Ethereum. This is done at the transactional level. At the consensus level, digital signatures are not employed in the current Proof of Work Ethereum. In PoW protocols, a block only needs to have the right hash to indicate that it was mined correctly; the miner's identity is irrelevant, hence no signature is required.\n\nValidators in the PoS Ethereum system are identifiable and accountable for their actions. We require validators to make attestations and blocks to be uniquely recognizable to enforce the [Casper FFG](https://medium.com/unitychain/intro-to-casper-ffg-9ed944d98b2d) rules and count votes for the[ LMD GHOST](https://ethresear.ch/t/bitwise-lmd-ghost/4749) fork choice.\n\nSince a digital signature permanently links the sender of a message to its contents, it can be used to prove and penalize a validator who has been acting maliciously. This functionality can also be utilized outside of the protocol – for example, as an anti-spam measure, signatures are validated by nodes in the gossip layer before being forwarded.\n\nTo digitally sign user transactions, the Execution Layer (like most blockchains) uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECDSA signatures are short (65 bytes) and verified in a matter of milliseconds. The Consensus Layer is designed in such a way that it can operate on a far bigger scale than standard blockchains. It requires validators to add signatures to their blocks so that other users or validators may verify the block's authenticity. Validators also sign their other actions on the Beacon chain with their signatures.\n\nThere can be situations where hundreds of thousands of signatures might need to be verified within a single epoch. If we use ECDSA, it would take us nearly 30 minutes to verify a million signatures – this wouldn't be good enough for the Beacon chain.\n\n## ECDSA: Not Good Enough for PoS\n\nA large number of protocol messages must be handled by proof of stake protocols. Over 780 attestations gossip globally every second on the Beacon Chain, which now has almost 400,000 active validators. The figure of 780 is simply an average; there can be much higher surges. These digital signatures must be confirmed by each node in addition to traveling over the network, which is a computationally intensive operation. These signed communications must be saved in the block history as well. In most Proof of Stake networks, these conditions severely limit the number of validators.\n\nThe initial design for post-PoS Ethereum was laid out in early 2018 by [EIP-1011](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1011.md). The proposal focused on on-chain PoS management and estimated that the protocol could only handle a maximum of around 900 validators due to the high message overhead. A hefty stake size of 1500ETH per validator was set. This was problematic as it would increase centralization.\n\nJustin Drake's article titled [Pragmatic Signature Aggregation with BLS](https://ethresear.ch/t/pragmatic-signature-aggregation-with-bls/2105?u=benjaminion) came out in May 2018 and changed the course of Ethereum's move to PoS.\n\n## The Solution\n\nDrake suggested adopting [Boneh-Lynn-Shacham](https://crypto.stanford.edu/\\~dabo/pubs/papers/BLSmultisig.html), or BLS, a novel signature scheme developed by Stanford researchers. It can aggregate many digital signatures into one while keeping each validator accountable. Aggregation not only cut down on the number of individual messages that needed to be passed across the network, but it also cut down on the expense of verifying the messages' integrity.\n\nIn terms of use, the BLS signature technique is similar to ECDSA, although it is quite different mathematically. They feature two distinct characteristics that aren't found in other signature schemes:\n\n* **Any number of signatures on any number of messages can be combined into a single signature with a constant size.** Although these signatures are larger (96 bytes) than ECDSA signatures, this means we no longer need to dedicate megabytes of space in blocks solely to signatures.\n* **Any number of signatures on the same message can be verified in constant time.** It takes roughly the same time to verify a million aggregated signatures on the same message as a single signature on that message. This is advantageous in the Consensus Layer as validators often sign the same messages (say, a given block).\n\nBecause of this signature aggregation feature, we decided to drop EIP-1011 and go with the Beacon chain model we have now. It makes the Consensus layer possible and allows the Beacon Chain to scale to hundreds of thousands of validators.\n\n*Note: BLS Signatures are only a temporary solution to this problem.*\n\n***Trigger warning: Math;*** it is optional and there is no test at the end. But give it a few minutes and you’ll understand everything better.\n\n## Elliptic Curve Pairings\n\nBLS makes use of \"**pairing**,\" a special property of some elliptic curves. A pairing is a function e that outputs an element in a finite field from a pair of two points on an elliptic curve. The pairings we consider are also bilinear. This bi-linearity property has enabled the development of new cryptographic methods based on pairings.\n\nTheoretically, all elliptic curves have pairings, but there are some curves with pairings that are not suitable for cryptographic applications in practice. So how do we go about choosing curves for pairing-based cryptography?\n\nThe embedding degree *k* is a parameter associated with each elliptic curve that we can calculate. We need *k* to be a small value (certainly less than 100) to employ curves to efficiently develop pairing-based cryptography. Because nearly all elliptic curves have a very big *k*, which is usually the same as the field modulus *q*, such curves are difficult to find (at least 160 bits). There are two approaches to finding pairing-friendly elliptic curves:\n\n1. Use curves that always have *k* ≤ 6, called **supersingular elliptic curves**.\n2. Use **complex multiplication** to construct certain families of elliptic curves with small *k*.\n\nBoth of these approaches have certain [tradeoffs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730686/#b5-jres.120.002).\n\nTo construct pairing-based cryptographic protocols, we must also specify a specific pairing function *e.* The two most commonly used pairings are Weil and Tate. Researchers have come up with several innovative pairings to speed up computation as time has passed. It's vital to know that the various pairings aren't interchangeable.\n\nElliptic curve cryptography relies on the difficulty of the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) and the [Computational Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_problem#:\\~:text=The%20Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman%20problem%20(DHP,compute%2C%20but%20hard%20to%20reverse) Problem(CDHP). Both these problems have been well studied and carefully chosen parameters for the elliptic curves make the cryptographic scheme secure. Pairing based cryptography relies on another security assumption called the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem (BDHP).\n\nNote: Read Vitalik Buterin’s article about Elliptic Curve Pairings [here](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/exploring-elliptic-curve-pairings-c73c1864e627) to get a better understanding of the topic.\n\nBDHP hasn't been well studied as it's a much newer problem. If one can solve the DLP or the CDHP, then one can also solve the BDHP. As a result, pairing-based cryptography does not have stronger security than elliptic curve cryptography. At present, there are no known attacks that can break the BDHP.\n\n\n---\n\n## BLS Signatures\n\nThe Beacon chain uses Boneh-Lynn-Shacham or BLS signatures with the [BLS12-381](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/bls12-381) elliptic curve. BLS utilizes the \"[pairing](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/exploring-elliptic-curve-pairings-c73c1864e627)\" property of certain elliptic curves. Although BLS signatures are a lot slower than ECDSA signatures, they can be aggregated together and are efficient to verify at a large scale. This signature aggregation allows the Beacon Chain to scale to hundreds of thousands of network participants.\n\n### Components\n\nThere are four key components within the BLS digital signature scheme:\n\n1. **The secret or private key:** is the key used by participants to sign messages and must not be shared with anyone.\n2. **The public key:** is uniquely derived from the private key; the private key cannot be calculated using the public key. The public key represents identity in a protocol and is known to everybody.\n3. **The message:** is a string of bytes.\n4. **The signature:** is created by combining the message with the private key. A digitally signed message can be verified using the public key corresponding to the secret key used to sign the message.\n\nThe underlying math involves using 2 subgroups of the BLS12-381 elliptic curve: *G₁* is defined over a base field *Fᵩ*, and *G₂* is defined over the field extension *F*ᵩ₁₂ . The order of both the subgroups is r, which is a 77-digit prime number. The generator of *G₁* is *g₁* , and of *G₂* is *g₂* .\n\n1. The secret key *sk* is a number between 1 and *r*. Small values of *r* are impractical for cryptographic purposes.\n2. The public key *pk* is *\\[sk\\]g₁* (the square brackets represent scalar multiplication of elliptic curve group point). The public key is a member of the *G₁* group.\n3. The message *m* is a string of bytes and can be of an arbitrary length. It is hashed to a fixed-length *H(m)*, a member of the *G₂* group.\n4. The signature *σ* is a member of the *G₂* group, namely *\\[sk\\]H(m)*\n\n### Key Pairs\n\nA key pair consists of a secret key along with its corresponding public key. The secret key is randomly generated in a secure environment and the public key is uniquely determined from the private key. Key pairs are commonly stored in password-protected keystore files. [EIP-2335](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2335.md) specifies the JSON format for the storage and interchange of BLS12-381 private keys.\n\nThe secret key *sk* is a 32-byte unsigned integer. It is a common practice to drop the y-coordinate of elliptic curve points to halve the amount of data stored. The same is done for the private key *pk*, which is a point on *G₁*.  For BLS12-381, *G₁* points are reduced from 96 bytes ( 2 \\* 381 bits) to 48 bytes.\n\n### Choice of Groups\n\nThe *G₁* and *G₂* groups are interchangeable when it comes to digital signatures. We can opt to have our public keys belong to *G₁* and our signatures belong to *G₂* or vice versa.\n\nThe tradeoffs are execution speed and storage space. *G₁* has small points and is fast, *G₂* has large points and is slow. BLS12-381 was developed to implement Zcash, and they picked *G₁* to represent signatures and *G₂* to represent public keys for performance reasons.\n\nIn the consensus layer, we use *G₁* for public keys since the aggregation of signatures happens a lot more than the aggregation of public keys. Another reason for doing so is public keys of validators need to be stored in state, so keeping the representation small is important. Signatures are *G₂* points.\n\n### Signing\n\nOnly [hash tree roots](https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/building_blocks/merkleization) of objects, or their so-called signature roots, which are 32-byte strings, are signed in the beacon chain protocol. We then need to map the signing root onto an elliptic curve point in the *G₂* group. For a message with a signing root *m*, the point is *H(m)*. Here, *H* is a function that maps bytes to *G₂*.\n\nOnce we have *H(m)*, the signing process is rather straightforward. The signature *σ* will be the scalar multiplication of *H(m)* by the secret key.\n\n*σ = \\[sk\\]H(m)*\n\nThe signature *σ* is also a member of the *G₂* group. It is 96 bytes long in its compressed form.\n\n### Verifying\n\nThe public key of the validator who signed a message is required. Every validator's public key is stored in the Beacon state and can be retrieved easily using the validator's index, which is always available.\n\nWe require the message, the public key, and the signature of the validator who signed the message to validate a signature. The verification method yields a boolean value indicating whether the signature is legitimate or not.\n\nIn the BLS12-381 curve, a pairing simply takes points *P* and *Q*, where *P*∈ *G₁* and *Q* ∈ *G₂ ,* and outputs a point from a group *Gₜ*  ⊂ *F*ᵩ₁₂ . Hence, for a pairing *e*,  *e*: *G₁* × *G₂ → Gₜ*.\n\nPairings are usually denoted like *e*(*P*, *Q*) and have special properties. If we have two points *P* and *S* in *G₁ ,* and *Q* and *R* in *G₂* ,\n\n* *e(P, Q+R) =  e(P,Q) ⋅  e(P, R)*, and\n* *e(P+S, R) =  e(P, R) ⋅  e(S, R)*\n\nBy convention, *G₁*  and *G₂* are written as additive groups and *Gₜ* as multiplicative. The ⋅ operator is point multiplication in *Gₜ.*\n\nUsing this, we can deduce that all of these identities hold\n\n*e*(\\[*a*\\]*P*, \\[*b*\\]*Q* ) = *e*(*P*, \\[*b*\\]*Q* ) a  = *e*(*P*, *Q*) *ab* = *e*(*P*, \\[*a*\\]*Q*) *b* = *e*(\\[*b*\\]*P*, \\[*a*\\]*Q*)\n\nUtilizing pairings, we can easily verify a signature. The signature is valid if and only if *e*(*g*1 , *σ* ) = *e*(*pk*, *H*(*m*))\n\nHence, given the message *m*, the public key *pk*, the signature *σ*, and the fixed generator *g₁* of the *G₁* group, we can verify that the message was signed by the secret key *sk*.\n\nWe’re only making use of the identity from the properties of pairings we’d seen above.\n\n*e*(*pk*,*H*(*m*)) = *e*(\\[*sk*\\]*g*1, *H*(*m*)) = *e*(*g₁* , *H*(*m*))(*sk*)  = *e*(*g₁*, \\[*sk*\\]*H*(*m*)) = *e*(*g₁*,*σ*)\n\nThe verification returns True if and only if the signature corresponds both to the public key of the signing validator (i.e. the signature and the public key were both generated from the same secret key) and to the message (i.e. the message is identical to the original signed message). Otherwise, it returns False.\n\n### Aggregation\n\nSo far, what we’ve covered about BLS is functionally very similar to any other digital signature scheme. The beauty of the BLS signature lies in aggregation. An aggregate signature is the same size as a regular signature (96 bytes). Aggregation means that multiple signatures over the same message – potentially thousands of signatures – can be checked with a single verification operation. This helps scale PoS blockchains and makes the consensus protocol viable.\n\nHow does it work? Since public keys and signatures are elliptic curve points, we can use the bilinearity property of the pairing function to form linear combinations of public keys and signatures over the same message. The verification still works the same.\n\n### Aggregating Signatures\n\nWe’ll discuss how signatures over the same message are aggregated. We add up the signatures. The addition of points on the elliptic curve is the group operation for the *G₂*  group, and each signature is a point in this group, thus the result is also a point in the group.\n\nMathematically, an aggregated signature cannot be distinguished from a non-aggregated signature. They have the same 96-byte size.\n\n### Aggregating Public Keys\n\nWe need an aggregate public key to verify an aggregate signature. This is easy to construct, provided we know which validators had signed the original message. Again, we just need to add up the public keys of the signers. The addition is the group operation of the *G₁* elliptic curve group, and the result will also be a member of the *G₁* group. Hence, an aggregated public key is mathematically indistinguishable from a non-aggregated public key and has the same size of 48 bytes.\n\n### Verifying Aggregate Signatures\n\nSince an aggregate signature is indistinguishable from a regular signature, and an aggregate public key is indistinguishable from a regular public key, we can simply follow our normal verification procedure. This is because of the bilinearity property of the pairing operation.\n\nIf we have an aggregate signature *σ* and a corresponding aggregate public key *pk*, and common message *m,* we get the following identity\n\n*e(pk , H(m)) = e(pk₁ + pk₂ + … + pkₙ , H(m))*\n\n*= e(\\[sk₁ + sk₂ + … + skₙ\\] g₁ , H(m))*\n\n*= e(g₁ , H(m)) (sk₁ + sk₂ + … + skₙ)*\n\n*=  e( g₁ , \\[sk₁ + sk₂ + … + skₙ\\] H(m))*\n\n*= e(g₁ , σ₁ + σ₂ + … + σₙ )*\n\n*= e(g₁ , σ)*\n\n\n---\n\n## Aggregation Advantages\n\nVerifying a BLS signature is a lot more computationally intensive than verifying an ECDSA signature. It is also considerably slower because of the pairing operation. So what advantage do we get by using BLS?\n\nIn situations where we can aggregate a large number of signatures, such as Beacon Chain attestation committees, BLS is advantageous. Ideally, all of a committee’s validators sign the same attestation data, hence allowing all of their signatures to be aggregated.\n\nIn practice, there might be two or three different attestations resulting from differences of opinion about the chain state between the committee members. In such a scenario, the aggregates will still be a lot lesser than the total number of members in a committee.\n\nAggregating the public keys and signatures is a lot cheaper than verification. This is because elliptic curve point additions are much, much cheaper than a pairing. Hence, using aggregation results in speed benefits.\n\nWe can verify a single signature with 2 pairings. Hence, we can naively verify *N* signatures with *2N* pairings. Or we could verify *N* signatures by aggregating them, using: 2 pairings, (*N* - 1) additions in *G₁*, and (*N* - 1) additions in *G₂* .\n\nThere are also space benefits. An aggregate signature has the same 96-byte length as a regular BLS signature. So, an aggregate of *N* signatures only occupies 1/*N* the space of the unaggregated signatures.\n\n\n---\n\n*We now know about what digital signature algorithm will be used in the Consensus Layer. But, is it a good enough solution for the long term?*\n\n*Stay tuned for the third part of this series for the answer, coming soon.*\n\n*You can find me on Twitter here: [@gryptooo](https://twitter.com/gryptooo)*\n\n*If you want to support what I do, you can send me some ETH to the address **0x6afeB3d9E380787e7D0a17Fc3CA764Bb885014FA** .

Interested in joining? [Get in touch](https://twitter.com/AnastasiaU).*\n\n## Preface\n\nIn summer 2020, I started my M.S. in information security and privacy because [I wanted to solve surveillance capitalism](https://ana.mirror.xyz/ibXBG-yrYeuBzFtTbCpIE-xPqJDr8SFPiiIdupcsUiM).\n\nI believe that surveillance capitalism poses an [existential risk](https://www.cser.ac.uk/) that, left to run rampant in ever more immersive digital spaces, *will* lead to the total dissolution of free and open societies -- and by extension, [hasten the onset of worldwide authoritarianism and civilizational collapse](https://www.abc.net.au/religion/shoshana-zuboff-threat-of-surveillance-capitalism/11433716) -- in our lifetimes.\n\nSo I thought it a worthwhile endeavor. NBD. 🤷‍♀️\n\nI graduated in May 2022, and all the efforts of my last semester revolved around a singular question:\n\n**“What would it take to build a sufficiently robust privacy moat around every digital citizen such that the costs of surveillance capitalism become too onerous for companies to pursue?”**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SkoR0i-MqEFcaHYGANY_V.png?height=2880&width=5120)\n\nBasically, how can I increase the costs enough to kill off this sociopathic business model…*forever?*\n\nSome people think that the answer – the *whole* answer – is crypto. Sorry to disappoint, but the blockchain is the not droid you’re looking for. It’s *one* of the spare parts of the human dignity droid you seek. Alas, it is not, by itself, enough. Not nearly.\n\nHere’s 17,500 words on why not, and what to do instead.\n\nThis essay is the long-delayed (I was busy in grad school, after all) conclusion to my three-part series on digital privacy, concealed influence, and cognitive consent. See previously published [Part I](https://ana.mirror.xyz/XhSTOgQvG9gBMGsyPgnGnUqvCGysrQBf2pz-KGDev9U) and [Part II](https://ana.mirror.xyz/OEs-8zTxfvllRSMrM4Zz7HZrlcD2bG9IgkO_bWaix-4).\n\nI submitted portions of this essay as part of my graduate capstone requirements. While the original tone veered academic, I’ve adapted it here to be more internet/Mirror friendly and accessible. (If you want the [vastly abridged version that I was required to submit for my final capstone, click here](https://ana.mirror.xyz/ZpaL0X0xNjOxnhmIvm0EyTmLD8HnRLlNjJrmhHwhFUY).)\n\n\n---\n\nOn a related note, I originally wrote this essay in March 2022, and a lot of it focuses on decentralized identity. That was mere months before crypto suddenly fell in love with solving identity -- after neglecting the issue for entirely too long. It's been amusing to watch the brouhaha instigated by the publication of the [now-infamous Soulbound tokens paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763) by Glen, Vitalik, and Puja (a prior version of which, called simply [Soulbound](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html), is even referenced in this essay).\n\nThe entire time I was in grad school, hardly anyone in crypto gave a shit about who owns our identities -- and therefore, our data -- which is partly what this essay is about. That was frustrating because to me, identity is like the master key for the whole  surveillance capitalism puzzle I had gone to grad school to solve. So in a sense, I found this community’s newfound romance with identity edifying, even if much of it was ill-conceived. (For my thoughts on all that, [see this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/AnastasiaU/status/1532584511107698689?s=20&t=SO4kBBhx062lM6FHVb1hIQ).) But it also caused me to regret not having published this essay (or the abridged capstone) on my Mirror earlier, because having these artifacts published would have been helpful when speaking with people about DIDs, VCs, and SBTs.\n\nBetter late than never, though. I took the entire month of June off to chill, read, work on personal projects, and finally, finally publish this doorstop of an essay. I wrote it to burst our collective crypto hype bubble about “data sovereignty” (bro, [I do not think that term means what you think it means](https://twitter.com/AnastasiaU/status/1542246235532296194?s=20&t=SO4kBBhx062lM6FHVb1hIQ)). But I also wrote it to offer real, workable pathways to human agency in this new, reimagined internet we’re busy building. So long as we’re out here reinventing compute, we might as well do it right this time around, right?\n\nThere is hope. There is still time. And thank goodness for the bear market, for now there is even the mental space and focus needed to get it right.\n\n## Part I. Introduction\n\nThe point of privacy has been pretty hard to pin down.\n\nIts shaky legal standing and philosophical underpinnings have mystified and eluded scholars, ethicists, jurists, legislators, and technologists for centuries. Certainly a hotly debated topic among intellectual elites, hoodie-cloaked DEFCON attendees, and cypherpunk libertarians for ages, less rarified company has always squinted at it with suspicion:\n\n*“If I nothing to hide, what do I have to fear?”*\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal finally thrust privacy -- and its attendant ambiguities -- into the sphere of popular inquiry and outcry.\n\nExpensive and embarrassing data breaches such as those suffered by Yahoo and Equifax had previously drawn headlines about unwarranted disclosures of personally identifiable information (PII). But whereas those data breaches constituted failures in *information security*, Cambridge Analytica underscored the need for a different type of assurance: *privacy protection*.\n\nPeople are often surprised to hear this, but **there was no data breach of Facebook’s records**. The harvested datasets from [87 million Facebook users that Cambridge Analytica used to microtarget voters and sway elections](https://ana.mirror.xyz/45xVi-VESqUaLP7e1BV5Z_zpGUTpDHiiAeJjy1-PbrI) were freely available because Facebook’s inadequate privacy protections allowed these manipulations to occur.\n\nAdvertising-supported technology platforms such as Meta, Google, and Twitter compete for attention and engagement to generate revenue, devising intentionally addictive user experiences and adversarial product interfaces designed to maximize user information capture. This data exhaust, or the trail of personal telemetry left behind by Internet users with little insight into or control over their digital footprints, is then sold to advertisers, malicious actors, and anyone willing to pay for the data, giving rise to the lucrative monetization of data for secondary purposes known as surveillance capitalism.Whether borne of hype, naïveté, or willful ignorance of history and facts, crypto and web3 (I’ll call it web3 for easy reference from here on out) perpetuate a misconception that blockchains are a sort of panacea that protects users against the predations of the past 20 years of surveillance-funded Big Tech business models.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rLjHPwDHPk0QFpQQSOKst.png?height=1558&width=2780)\n\nThis is patently wrong. On most popular blockchains, sensitive data is public by default. Far from protecting user autonomy and data sovereignty, blockchains greatly increase the attack surface for digital privacy infringement. Meanwhile, mechanisms for protecting our digital privacy remain almost nonexistent and certainly inadequate. In some cases, society’s attempts to protect digital privacy have arguably made matters materially worse, as with the false sense of security provided by the General Data Protection Act (GDPR), for example (more on that later).\n\n**In short, we are not ready for the metaverse.**\n\nThis essay shows that crypto alone will not defeat surveillance capitalism, even if the underlying business model shifts from centralized to decentralized, or from platform to protocol. It offers, instead, an outcomes-based framework for designing strong protections against surveillance capitalism by isolating the inputs (such as data exhaust) that give rise to it and replacing them with mechanisms that enhance user sovereignty and agency.\n\nI examine the history of privacy jurisprudence, philosophy, and identity governance. I then review the inadequacies of existing protections and frameworks. I isolate the primitives that produce surveilled dystopias: neglect of user-centric identity, overexposure of user telemetry, and consent theatrics. I conclude by asking the technical, engineering, and standards community that’s building emerging technologies to coordinate, conspire, and root out these pathologies.\n\nI recognize this is a massive coordination challenge. The purpose of the essay is to motivate the collective willpower of the web3 community to meet the challenge not with resignation and exasperation, but with resolve, curiosity, creativity, and craft.\n\nAfter all, we are still so early, *but we are already almost too late*.\n\n## Part II. Isolating Root Causes\n\nData exhaust is valuable to marketers and information operatives because it powers behavior models used to predict and manipulate outcomes. These outcomes can be as innocuous as influencing a purchase, or something altogether more alarming, such as polarizing an electorate and swaying a vote. There is [growing acknowledgement among lawmakers, policy experts, technologists, and consumers alike](https://www.wired.com/story/tristan-harris-tech-is-downgrading-humans-time-to-fight-back/) that platforms that feed on user telemetry are correlated with and often causally linked to political polarization, online toxicity, isolation and depression, and distrust in democratic institutions (Harris, 2019). The balkanization of public consensus resulting from behavior manipulation and targeted narrative warfare [spills over into real world violence](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/facebook-whistleblower-zuckerberg-frances-haugen-b1944865.html) (Smith, 2021) and has, according to former National Security Advisor Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, become a serious [national security threat](https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/45-is-world-war-iii-already-here) (Harris & Raskin, 2022).\n\nRegulations have failed to stem the tide of data exhaust that powers surveillance capitalism. This is in part due to the [pacing problem](https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/commentary/pacing-problem-and-future-technology-regulation): innovation moves faster than its effects can be felt and described with sufficient precision to devise mitigation strategies – and by that time, the harm is already done (Thierer 2020). Even then, regulatory remedies only address symptoms that emerge downstream from a critical flaw in the original design. They do not, by definition, address underlying causes, so harms perpetuate in forms not captured in the new law. Ambiguity about what exactly privacy is and how much privacy citizens should enjoy further complicates the task of devising solutions for a problem that eludes definition (Cohen, 2012).\n\n\n---\n\n*Food for thought: the existence of regulation is a very good sign that something has gone terribly wrong further upstream at the system architecture and incentive design level. The false sense of security provided by regulation lulls us into a dangerous complacency: instead of addressing root causes, we slap a law on it and call our work done. And so, negative externalities accumulate.*\n\n\n---\n\nAlthough pacing problems and definitional ambiguities do not serve society well, they are not the crux of the issue. **The first root cause of surveillance capitalism is a failure to build the Internet with a persistent, portable, and composable identity layer that allows users to self-custody their privacy decisions and self-govern how they connect, to what services, and under which conditions.** The best available proxy for digital identity became the email address – and later, the social media account – which associated users to a data store of attributes and interactions owned and operated by technology companies – such as Google and Meta – issuing those accounts.\n\nSince this model of identity management separated users from custody over their data, privacy governance has focused on how *companies* should handle their users’ data, and *not what users should be able to do with their own data*. But privacy is a continuum of people’s ever-shifting boundaries and preferences that ebb and flow according to situation, environment, time, and mood. These characteristics defy the prescriptive, uniform definitions promulgated by centrally-defined regulatory frameworks and legal remedies. Contexts shift while governance remains static and codified, leaving user privacy boundaries vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal laid bare the need for better protections against surveillance capitalism: protections *not only for the information security of the sensitive PII* that platforms manage, but for the *metadata contained in our data exhaust that falls outside the scope of information security*, and, crucially, for the autonomous agency and cognition of the person described by that metadata and PII. To reimagine privacy governance from first principles, we must first rearchitect how we issue, manage, and govern digital identity — and in so doing, place users at the center of their data sovereignty.\n\nWith the rise of public blockchains, this challenge is now even more pressing. Smart contracts enter sensitive transactions in the immutable public record for anyone, including advertisers, data brokers, and malicious actors, to track, analyze, and model, exacerbating the data exhaust problem that powers surveillance capitalism on platform businesses. Meanwhile, the persuasive, hypnotic immersions of the emerging metaverse, already valued as a $1 trillion opportunity by [a recent report by J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm/treasury-services/documents/opportunities-in-the-metaverse.pdf), further enrich the menu of data types, biometric markers, and interaction patterns subject to monetizable capture.\n\nInternet users require robust protections across the full landscape of digital experiences, a daunting and infinitely complex undertaking that centrally managed governance has provably failed to provide. Unless we give users full custody of their identities – and therefore their data, privacy preferences, and access controls – blockchains will not only replicate but multiply the same problems that gave us Cambridge Analytica.\n\n## Part III: Privacy as a Public Good\n\n> *“The data revolution will bring untold benefits to the citizens of the future. They will have unprecedented insight into how other people think, behave and adhere to norms…The newfound ability to obtain accurate and verified information online, easily, in native language and in endless quantity, will usher in an era of critical thinking in societies around the world…Anyone with a mobile handset and access to the Internet will be able to play a part in promoting accountability and transparency.” – Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO (Schmidt & Cohen, 2014)*\n\nTechnology always outmaneuvers the legal, philosophical, and regulatory frameworks that humans construct to keep pace with the ingenuity of our inventions, leaving our cognitive defenses and behavioral norms forever struggling to adapt to the evolving pressures and affordances of exponential innovation.\n\nSo we read Eric Schmidt’s breathless enthusiasm with a sense of irony and foreboding: Just where are these new critical thinking skills and accountability benefits we were promised? How did we mess up? What would it take to stymie the accretive privacy losses to ubiquitous technology and thrive *in partnership* with our inventions? Can we still shape our proverbial tools, or is our sovereign agency consigned to executing to our tools’ design, without recourse for self-determination?\n\nA bad workman always blames his tools, as they say. Might we become better workmen by shifting away from over-reliance on tools (such as cybersecurity technologies and regulatory remedies) and towards nimbler mental models, design constructs, and [technosocial virtues](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190498511.001.0001/acprof-9780190498511) capable of adapting alongside an industry that is by necessity in constant transition?\n\nThe Western mindset is deeply informed by the natural rights philosophy of John Locke and Thomas Hobbes: life in a state of nature is mostly nasty, brutish, and short, and rights are limited to what is observable about man in this austere environment. He has the right to his life, to his freedom, and to the property that he possesses. In return, he ought simply not interfere with these same empirically derived natural rights that all other men possess except through contractual agreement. Conceptions of what is right, good, and ethical in Western thought tend to be framed in terms of what produces social utility and favorable consequences without imposing on aforementioned on natural rights.\n\nBy contrast, claims to essentialism or innate morality are often rejected as irrational, mystical, and outdated. If the separation of church and state proscribes any divine right of kings, then there can be no inherent code of ethics that exists outside the sphere of empirical inquiry. To the extent that we have natural rights, these are rationally derived from observation. Even Immanuel Kant’s deontological ethics, classically understood as the opposite of utilitarian consequentialism, firmly rejects essentialism in favor of logic and reason. The categorical imperative judges actions by how likely they are to produce sound universal laws, and not by any innate, “God-given,” or mystical quality.\n\nAtop these rationalist roots, the Western tradition layers on the various pleasures of the social contract and the conditions required to maintain it. Most ethical debates about what rational man ought and ought not do in a society likewise revolve around evidence-based, consequential reasoning about the qualities of a society people want to live in.\n\nUntil philosopher Helen Nissenbaum [described privacy as a contextual spectrum determined by situation-specific informational norms](https://digitalcommons.law.uw.edu/wlr/vol79/iss1/10/) (2010), most experts and lawmakers had sought to articulate a precise universal definition – and to define privacy’s value as a function of consequences: what we enjoy with privacy, and what we suffer without it. Prior to Nissenbaum’s work, a monolithic description of privacy, or at least a quantifiable evaluation of its societal worth, had been seen as a precondition for devising governance. But while laws require precise signifiers and irrefutable evidence, people’s privacy boundaries are variable and idiosyncratic, so any singular definition will necessarily feel reductive, vague, and incomplete.\n\nSamuel Warren and Louis Brandeis’ essay “[The Right to Privacy](https://doi.org/10.2307/1321160)” in a 19th century volume of the *Harvard Law Review* offered perhaps the first contribution to legal scholarship on privacy. Their polemic against the intrusions of the “modern media”, which reported on a private wedding ceremony without permission (reporting made possible, notably, by the “disruptive” technology of the day: the invention of photo cameras) influenced over a century of privacy jurisprudence (1890). They argued that just as “a man’s house is his castle,” the private facts, thoughts, and emotions that constitute “inviolate personality” should likewise be shielded from public view.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7NquoI6PUMEx1RpKiwaEm.png?height=2880&width=5120)\n\nTheir impassioned plea foreshadowed modern-day concerns about the impact of technology on private life and laid the groundwork for the subsequent establishment of privacy torts that [enumerate four specific harms](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3478805?origin=crossref): intrusion upon seclusion, public disclosure of private facts, false light, and appropriation of name or likeness (Prosser, 1960). Importantly, Warren and Brandeis’ essay continued the longstanding Western tradition of evidence-based reasoning by framing privacy in terms of harms done to the inviolate autonomy of the individual. In so doing, Warren and Brandeis carried Western consequentialism out of philosophy and over to jurisprudence.\n\nHistorical attempts to capture and define the legal boundaries of experiences as subjective and context-dependent as privacy expectations have largely proven too rigid and incomplete to be practicable. This is especially true of digital privacy, where in-the-moment harms seem too theoretical and diffuse to be real (until, of course, they accumulate; see: [privacy’s “dead body” problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/magazine/facebook-and-the-dead-body-problem.html)). To give digital privacy the weight of consequence, scholars have sought to broaden the scope of harms beyond the narrow definitions of intrusive injuries and torts by connecting privacy to ideals of self-expression and self-actualization.\n\nPsychiatrist David Rosen and literary scholar Aaron Santesso, for example, write that privacy is:\n\n> *“…a necessary condition for the formation of an autonomous person; integrity of soul, inversely, is the underlying justification for a new right. The various invasions of daily life are not mere annoyances but threats that might arrest the development of the self, a chrysalislike process that, to be successful, must remain ‘inviolate.’” (2011).*\n\nIn legal expert Julie Cohen’s view, privacy preserves “spaces for free moral and cultural play” necessary for moral autonomy and independent critical thought:\n\n> *“\\[Scholars should\\] examine the experiences of network users through the lens \\[of\\] ordinary routines and rhythms of everyday practice. In particular, scholars concerned with the domains of creativity and subject formation should pay careful attention to the connections between everyday practice and play…and the ways in which culture and subjectivity emerge.” (Cohen, ch. 5, pp. 1-2)*\n\nLaw professor Herbert Burkert argues that privacy enables agency over how we see ourselves and in turn present ourselves to others:\n\n> *“One of the more recent critiques of the notion of privacy argues that it misses the essence of identity. Identity is not a constant but a process. We do not develop our identity by keeping ourselves separate from others; our identity is what others know about us. In knowing about us, power is already exercised. The way we are seen by others greatly influences the way we see ourselves” (1998, p. 138).*\n\nEthicist Shannon Vallor describes how affronts to human agency short-circuit the capacity to soundly evaluate options and make agentic choices:\n\n> *“Our digital liberation from cultural hegemony is itself endangered by multinational media consolidation and the deliberate design of ‘sticky’ digital media delivery systems that exploit neurological and psychological mechanisms to undermine our self-control…\\[but\\] many new media pleasures are consciously designed to be delivered to us in ways that undermine our cognitive autonomy and moral agency. They make it harder, not easier, for us to choose well.” (2016, pp. 166-168)*\n\nFinally, political scientist Priscilla Regan believes that privacy provides positive social value:\n\n> *“When we credit privacy with the role it plays in promoting values such as autonomy, human development, and freedom of thought and action, we stop at the good of the individuals. It is time…to emphasize how critical these values – values such as freedom of speech, association, and religion – are to the flourishing of liberal societies. As such, privacy is to be grasped as a common value.” (Nissenbaum 2010, p. 84)*\n\nScholars have also argued the inverse: that the absence of privacy causes various harms, including self-censorship, preference falsification, chilling effects, interference with autonomy, and even reality distortions.\n\nPrivacy scholar Daniel Solove writes that [people need privacy not to conceal illicit activity, but to avert social disciplining effects, without which their choices fall subject to decisional interference](https://ssrn.com/abstract=998565) (2007). People generally fear the disapproval of their peers, so individuals in surveilled spaces self-censor, [falsify their preferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification#:\\~:text=Preference%20falsification%20is%20the%20act,preference%20is%20more%20acceptable%20socially.), and communicate ideas that differ from their true perspectives, generating a distorted view of reality which produces a [chilling effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect) on society at large. The accumulated misrepresentations of people’s real thoughts and sentiments conceal true consensus about what people actually believe. These distorted signals achieve increasingly genuine social acceptance and normalization over time, leading to what philosopher Jeffrey Reiman calls *psychopolitical metamorphosis*:\n\n> *“Extrinsic losses of freedom occur when people curtail outward behaviors that might be unpopular, unusual, or unconventional because they fear tangible and intangible reprisals, such as ridicule, loss of a job, or denial of benefits. Intrinsic losses of freedom are the result of internal censorship caused by awareness that one’s every action is being noted and recorded…They are thus deprived of spontaneity and full agency as they self-consciously formulate plans and actions from this third-party perspective.” (Nissenbaum 2010, p. 75).*\n\nPublic opinion research supports the notion that privacy losses produce harmful inhibiting behaviors:\n\n> *“The Pew Research Center…has released a worrisome study suggesting that social media platforms not only fail to reliably foster open civic discourse, they often inhibit it…With remarkable consistency across the study metrics, the researchers found that social media users seem to be disproportionately inclined in civic life to fall victim to the phenomenon known as the ‘spiral of silence.’ This is the tendency of holders of a minority viewpoint to become increasingly inclined to self-censor in order to escape the social penalties for disagreement, which in turn artificially boosts the perceived strength of the majority opinion across the community, further quieting dissent. The study authors hypothesize that in online contexts, ‘this heightened self-censorship might be tied to social media users’ greater awareness of the opinions of others in their network.’” (Vallor 2016, p 183).*\n\nAs a result, Reiman argues that constant panoptic surveillance not only changes the thoughts people express but also the behaviors they adopt. A virulent modern example of this phenomenon is apparent in how social media alters the flow of public discourse. People fearing “cancellation,” loss of job, and reputational harm refrain from participating in certain conversations or subjecting their ideas to scrutiny to avoid retribution. This *chilling effect* on society discourages or inhibits the legitimate exercise of people’s natural and legal rights simply because they fear there might be repercussions, even if those fears may be unfounded.\n\n\n---\n\n*The term “panoptic” refers to the “panopticon,” a prison architecture devised by philosopher Jeremy Bentham where guards observe prisoners at will without any of the prisoners knowing whether or when they are being watched. The panopticon is often cited as a metaphor for modern-day surveillance technologies, where watchers observe but the watched cannot reciprocate, widening the power dynamics between institutions and the public –and between companies and customers. An important account of panoptic architectures as a tool of social discipline is included in philosopher Michel Foucault’s Discipline and Punish (Foucault & Sheridan 1995).*\n\n\n---\n\nFinally, social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff offers a human rights-based defense against the disciplining effects, asymmetric power dynamics, and reality distortions of panoptic life:\n\n> *“Self-determination and autonomous moral judgment, generally regarded as the bulwark of civilization, are recast \\[by surveillance capitalist business models\\] as a threat to collective well-being. Social pressure, well-known to psychologists for its dangerous production of obedience and conformity, is elevated to the highest good as the means to extinguish the unpredictable influences of autonomous thought and moral judgment. These new architectures feed on our fellow feeling to exploit and ultimately to suffocate the individually sensed inwardness that is the wellspring of personal autonomy and moral judgment, the first-person voice, the will to will, and the sense of an inalienable right to the future tense.” (2019, p. 444)*\n\nBy placing our survival needs for social approbation above our developmental needs for individual agency, surveilled spaces invite confirmation bias and groupthink. Individuals become more susceptible to social pressure and propaganda, especially if shared by those they wish to emulate or impress. Thus, even if people have nothing whatsoever to hide, surveillance materially alters perceived social norms and expressed behaviors, and interferes with our ability to build trust, perceive consensus, coordinate across social groups, and arrive at shared truth.\n\nBut why, if privacy carries no innate moral worth, and if its value is merely a function of its consequences, has Western scholarship attempted to govern privacy as if it does have uniform significance? Universally defined, centrally managed privacy frameworks (such as the GDPR and others covered later in this essay) all stumble on contradictions and inadequacies because they seek to establish consensus about privacy’s essence that holds constant across all contexts, settings, and environments. In contrast, we have seen that the utility and valuation of privacy varies greatly depending on the harms and benefits derived. In other words, Western scholarship seeks essentialist governance for evidential experience.\n\nThis, of course, creates massive conceptual and practical difficulties. The paradox between rationalist ethics and essentialist governance contributes to the chaotic state of privacy governance today. Cohen offers a particularly vivid account:\n\n> *People’s understandings and expectations of privacy \\[are\\] hard to understand. Surveys report that ordinary people experience a relatively high generalized concern about privacy but a relatively low level of concern about the data generated by specific transactions, movements, and communications. Some policy makers interpret the surveys as indicating either a low commitment to privacy or a general readiness to trade privacy for other goods. Others argue that the various ‘markets’ for privacy have informational and structural defects that prevent them from generating privacy-friendly choices. They argue, as well, that inconsistencies between reported preferences and revealed behavior reflect a combination of resignation and befuddlement; most Internet users do not understand how the technologies work, what privacy policies mean, or how the information generated about them will actually be used.*\n>\n> *Confronted with these developments and struggling to make sense of them, courts increasingly throw up their hands, concluding that constitutional guarantees of privacy simply do not speak to many of the new technologies, business models, and behaviors, and that privacy policy is best left to legislators. Legislators are quick to hold hearings but increasingly slow to take action; in many cases, they prefer to delegate day-to-day authority to regulators. Regulators, for their part, rely heavily on principles of notice, consent, reasonable expectation, and implied waiver to define the scope of individual rights with respect to the practices that fall within their jurisdiction.*\n>\n> *Legal scholars also have struggled to respond to these social, technological, and legal trends. There is widespread (though not unanimous) scholarly consensus on the continuing importance of privacy in the networked information economy, but little consensus about what privacy is or should be. Among other things, legal scholars differ on whether privacy is a fundamental human right, what circumstances would justify pervasive government monitoring of movements and communications, whether guarantees of notice and informed consent are good or even effective safeguards against private-sector practices that implicate privacy, and what to make of the inconsistency between expressed preferences for more privacy and revealed behavior that suggests a relatively low level of concern. (2012, ch.5, pp. 1-2)*\n\nTo bring Western consequentialism in coherence with its inconveniently essentialist privacy governance, protections should focus on responsiveness to experience and agility in context. Instead, current privacy governance is determinate and universal: a fitting model for essentialist, unchanging ideas, but not ones that are driven by observable utility and subjective experience.\n\nPerhaps a more useful framework for governing privacy might offer individuals greater latitude to modulate how much privacy they wish and when. More privacy is not always desirable, nor is it always possible. The key is to be able to choose, or at least to bring the absence of choice into conscious awareness.\n\n## Part IV: Distinguishing Between Concealed Influence and Legitimate Exchange\n\n*“There is nothing in the mind which was not first in some manner in the senses.” – Rene Descartes*\n\nWhile there is widespread agreement about the causal link between agency, autonomy, self-determination, and privacy, its subjective and context-dependent nature does not lend itself to quantification or uniform governance. Yet it is precisely this nebulous space of shifting norms and expectations that privacy management must somehow locate and defend without collapsing the context necessary for nuanced, context-responsive governance.\n\nIt is worth pausing here to inquire where the distinction between concealed influence and autonomous self-formation truly lies. As philosopher Gerald Dworkin writes in his essay “[The Nature of Autonomy](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/nstep.v1.28479),” autonomy is “identified with qualities of self-assertion, critical reflection, freedom from obligation, absence of external causation and knowledge of one’s own interests” (2015). But where precisely do these interests lie, if they are in constant negotiation with the external pressures and considerations of socialized daily life? To paraphrase the great rationalist dictum, can there be anything in the mind that did not get there through the senses first? And if so, can a meaningful border be drawn between concealed influence of the sort that produces manipulation and legitimate interaction of the sort that creates consensual exchange? Nissenbaum notes the obvious ambiguity:\n\n> *“We may all readily agree that no one (except possibly a hermit or someone living in total isolation) can have absolute control over all information about him- or herself. In this regard, we are all at the mercy of those simply passing by us on streets or engaging with us in mundane daily interactions, and more so with others who have virtually unbounded access to us. So, even if we agree that a claim to privacy is morally legitimate, and that privacy is about control or restricted access to information about us, it would be singularly unhelpful to circumscribe a right in such a way that it is violated every time a motorist peers at a pedestrian crossing the street” (2010, p.73).*\n\nTo locate that defining line between manipulation and conversation, it’s helpful to interrogate the interplay between influence and autonomy. Like Nissenbaum, Dworkin grants that fully impervious “autonomy in the acquisition of principles and values is impossible,” but caveats that autonomy is preserved when influence is contextualized by clues as to the surrounding situation (1988, p. 18). Such contextualization offers the autonomous individual an opportunity to consent to or reject the influence:\n\n> *“\\[There are\\] ways of influencing people’s reflective and critical faculties which subvert them from those which promote and improve them. It involves distinguishing those influences such as hypnotic suggestion, manipulation, coercive persuasion, subliminal influence, and so forth, and doing so in a non ad hoc fashion.” (ibid)*\n\nAccording to Nissenbaum, “there seems to be a line, however fuzzy, between entrepreneurial salesmanship and unethical manipulation” which is determined by the way that information is assembled. Information may be assembled to inform the subject and overtly seek conscious consent – or it may be assembled “for purposes that are manipulative and paternalistic and not transparently evident to the consumers who are the subjects of these personalized treatments” (2010, pp. 210-211).\n\nThere is a discernible difference in kind between information and manipulation, even if the distinction is somewhat blurry. The former constitutes open, contextually obvious, and disclosed promotional activity based on an individual’s declarative choices. The latter involves precise tracking, targeting, and covert manipulation constructed from inference instead of declarative preference, and driven by prediction rather than curation. Historian Yuval Harari helps understand this distinction:\n\n> *“As biotechnology and machine learning improves, it will become easier to manipulate people’s deepest emotions and desires and it will become more dangerous than ever to just follow your heart. When Coca-Cola, Amazon, Baidu, or the government know how to pull the strings of your heart and press the buttons of your brain, will you be able to tell the difference between your self and their marketing experts?” (Ammerman 2019, p. 173)*\n\nThe medium is the message that carries key contextual clues for obtaining conscious consent. For example, a sign outside a restaurant is definitionally visible to all people who pass by, invisible to people who do not, and is surrounded by contextual information about the neighborhood and other nearby establishments. Importantly, these clues are the same for everyone. Targeted treatments in digital environments, on the other hand, conceal the medium and obfuscate the context, making truly consent-based decisions impossible to provide.\n\nWhen entrepreneurial salesmanship crosses that ill-defined line into unethical manipulation, interactions cease to be legitimate, consent obtained ceases to be conscious, and influence becomes intentionally concealed. So long as digital advertising is done in a surreptitious manner, based on calculations internet users do not understand nor have control over — and with the express purpose of predicting and manipulating their behavior — then digital experiences are fundamentally non-consensual.\n\nIt is this boundary between concealed influence and cognitive consent that privacy governance must somehow locate and negotiate. But it is difficult to see how any centrally managed framework that aspires to define privacy universally across all settings could accomplish this feat of nuance with due rigor.\n\nPerhaps the locus of control to negotiate this porous boundary between influence and manipulation should belong to the individual whose consequential experience is most affected and who therefore has the most granular context upon which to formulate a defensive response?\n\nIn “[Privacy and the Limits of Law](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2060957)”, law professor Ruth Gavison offers the first building block for a more coherent model of responsive privacy governance. Gavison reframes privacy as a degree of control that we exert over others’ access to our cognition through information exchanged, attention given, and physical presence shared (1980). In so doing, she lifts privacy governance out of failed normative attempts to universally protect something that has variable value. In short, if privacy does not carry any intrinsic, essential morality that holds constant across contexts and requires a persistent and unchanging control setting, then governance should be responsive and modular while controls should be based on experiential preference and needs.\n\nA workable model for privacy management would therefore have to find a way to empower individuals to make context-dependent, consensual choices about external influences and to modulate the amount of access they allow others into their private, autonomous sphere of cognition.\n\n## Part V: Addressing Our Collective Neglect of Privacy\n\nThat this boundary between self-derived notions and exogenous manipulations is so very porous is precisely why digital privacy has proven difficult to legislate, regulate, or meaningfully protect in Western scholarship and technology education. Absent a strong tradition of innate morality in the deeply rational Western canon, one must either appeal to infringements on life, liberty, or property, or else produce quantifiable evidence of social value or harm. In other words, for consequentialist ethics, one must produce *consequences*.\n\nBut how should one produce evidence of harm with nothing more than a nebulous feeling of manipulation or perceived restriction? As law professor Ann Bartow laments, privacy does not have “[enough dead bodies](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=938482)” to serve as proof that privacy encroachments produce real injuries that merit serious attention (2006).\n\nBut Bartow was writing in 2006, and today, the consequences of adversarial technology, including the proliferation of mis- and disinformation, online toxicity, and real-world violence, have been exhaustively documented. Especially vivid accounts of privacy’s dead bodies come courtesy of Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie in his tell-all book, *Mindf\\*ck* (2019), in the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee report that followed Wylie’s revelations (2020), in the popular Netflix documentary *The Social Dilemma* that brought these revelations more sharply into the public’s view, and of course, via Zuboff’s own work.\n\nThe boogeyman all these accounts point to is the business model of engagement-driven economics, which relies on harvesting user attention for resale to advertisers. When revenues depend on the reliable delivery of views, clicks, and shares to advertisers, companies have a fiduciary incentive to uncover the emotional and psychological triggers that induce people to engage and build ingenious mechanisms to serve up those triggers with exquisite precision. These mechanisms, better known as algorithms, reward and amplify outrageous, inflammatory, polarizing, and very often inaccurate content because it weaponizes certain personality traits (known as [Big Five](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656617300843#:\\~:text=One%20major%20focus%20has%20been,the%20world's%20largest%20SNS%20platform.) and [Dark Triad](https://www.psypost.org/2021/03/dark-personality-traits-linked-to-compulsive-and-aggressive-online-behaviors-59924)) while downplaying more moderate, measured perspectives because they do not inspire as much reaction and *engagement* (Grassegger & Krogerus 2017, Sumner et al 2012, and Bhagat et al 2020). The resulting [fracture of public trust in media and institutions creates echo-chambers that manufacture consensus, pollute the information ecology](https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2018-11/digital-maginot-line), and erode cognitive autonomy to make sovereign, consent-based choices not only about our purchasing decisions, but also in our sensemaking. These harms are not confined to digital spaces, or even to the emotional baggage we accumulate when we disconnect; they spill directly over into [tragedies such as the 2021 U.S. Capitol riot](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/facebook-whistleblower-zuckerberg-frances-haugen-b1944865.html) (Smith, 2021).\n\nIf we do away with the business model that powers surveillance capitalism, do the underlying privacy encroachments go away with it? That is to say, if the Big Tech platforms that aggregate and monetize engagement cede ground to a decentralized model that is fundamentally different from the centralized businesses it replaces, will the main pathology that leads to surveillance capitalism – the neglect of privacy and user-owned identity that leaves behind so much rich data exhaust to mine for prediction and manipulation – be somehow “healed”? If users cease to be the product and become the customer, is their cognitive consent thereby secured?\n\nBlockchain technologies are birthing a new era in how humans transact value, exchange ideas, and construct meaning. They promise to deliver consumers out of extractive platforms that monetize personal data and into a new economic paradigm in which users own their data. Will this effectively end surveillance capitalism, or merely shift its business model?\n\nEmphatically, the answer (and this point cannot be overstated and therefore must be obnoxiously capitalized) is **NO, IT DOES NOT defeat surveillance capitalism and YES, IT DOES only shift the operating business model**.\n\n**Blockchains, by themselves, do not produce data sovereignty. The only thing that blockchains do is defeat platform data capture by opening up the social graph. Sure, Meta no longer owns my user history, but I’ll do you one better: now everyone on the internet has access to it and can do with it as they damn well please! And the last person who has any control over it is me, the original user and the ostensible owner of that data**.\n\n**Data transparency is not the same thing as data sovereignty, which has become something of a meaningless marketing term misused by anyone building analytics and social graph products in web3.** If we want to achieve an agentic, dignified technological future without surveillance capitalism, we cannot be satisfied with merely defeating platform lock-in by opening the social graph. We need to deal with the other primitives that give rise to surveillance capitalism: users separated from control over their identities, unchecked data exhaust, and consent theater.\n\nThere is a flaw in the hopeful logic that blockchain technologies will, on their own, address most of Big Tech’s harms because most of those harms are rooted in ineffective privacy protections, not economics. While self-evidently true that new incentives produce new behaviors, the prospect of a new economic model does not by itself address the underlying forces that resulted in the current era of surveillance capitalism: data exhaust, behavior tracking, aggregation, and users separated from ownership of their personal information. **The same forces will produce surveillance capitalism in crypto because the business model is merely a symptom of the problem, not its source.** So long as the behavioral surplus that emerges from ineffective and outdated privacy frameworks enables the monetization of personal data for commercial gain, surveillance capitalism will pervade digital environments irrespective of their business economics.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2UrtwmVkS4a-BzzK31xbK.png?height=1606&width=1606)\n\nIronically, privacy is made far worse, not better, on the blockchain, because even if users own their data, all their transactions become a matter of public record, exposing them to targeted monitoring and surveillance. Instead of entrusting personal data to a handful of dominant cloud technology companies, social media firms, and third-party data brokers, crypto users instead entrust their data to anyone who wishes to perform a rudimentary Etherscan search.\n\nPainting a complete picture of all historical transactions tied to a public key is trivial for anyone who can use an API. With some additional effort, reidentification and pattern correlation of the type that enable concealed influence and outcome manipulation are not much more difficult, and don’t even require sophisticated machine learning algorithms to produce. In fact, [it has already been done](https://decrypt.co/19423/we-tracked-133000-ethereum-names-and-exposed-their-secrets): in 2020, a team of journalists at *Decrypt* “analyzed 133,000 Ethereum names and their respective balances” and “found it was possible to identify several high-profile people, even if they weren’t using their real names…see business deals, and watch people’s movements, just using the blockchain.” (Copeland, 2020) All that surveillance capability using a blockchain that has nothing to do with engagement farming or advertising-supported extractive platform economics!\n\n**Blaming Big Tech has become a crutch for crypto’s unwillingness to admit its own culpability in adding to the surveillance problem.** Instead of scapegoating platform economics, it is time for web3 to drop the facile narrative that engagement-driven business models are solely to blame for eroding consumer privacy. This narrative is reductive and lazy. The underlying issue is that we fail to protect privacy by not giving users meaningful control over how they are influenced and when. This holds true regardless of the business model.\n\nIf we want to solve for privacy, we have to deal with privacy, not business models.\n\n## Part VI: Challenging the Legitimacy of Informed Consent\n\n*“Law 31 - Control the Options: Get Others to Play with the Cards you Deal: The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in control, but are actually your puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose. Force them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the horns of a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn.” - Robert Greene,* The 48 Laws of Power\n\nWithout clear consensus about what privacy means or when it has value, it has been impossible to unify perspectives on how to adjudicate, defend, or design for it. Absent definitional clarity, some approaches took on the ambitious and ill-fated task of predicting what kinds of data environments a user might face, imagining all the data types that might be exchanged and for what purpose, and prescribing exactly how each of those transactions and interactions are to be governed. In a technology space experiencing exponential innovation, such deterministic proposals not only limit the possibility space for what can be invented, but rapidly fall out of relevance as system designers and engineers find creative workarounds that most often find their way to the consumer in the form of high-friction user experiences.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Privacy Framework (NIST), for example, set out to “build customer trust” by “future-proofing products and services” (2020). It proposed to do this essentially by predicting the future: defining information inventory strategies and data processing policies, subdividing data types and users into categories, and prescribing response and communication protocols across the entire surface area of consumer-facing technology. That this framework was built to help companies comply with requirements rather than to help users preserve their cognitive autonomy is the first clue to why its relevance and applicability are limited.\n\nMore importantly, it is not difficult to imagine how attempts to “future-proof” technology by setting out to enumerate all emergent data types and interaction flows a user in some hypothetical future product might face would lead to contradictory design choices for software architects and unintended complications for users.\n\nThe practice of writing long and inscrutable Terms of Service (TOS) and End-User License Agreements (EULA) is the direct result of the tension between compliance requirements and irreconcilable design contradictions. Since companies cannot anticipate every possible context that a user might face any more so than a regulatory framework can, they settled on a workaround. By notifying users and obtaining their consent to relinquish data and decision rights in exchange for service, companies got off the hook for safeguarding contextual integrity while passing the burden of privacy management off to users without giving them the necessary tools to manage their boundaries.\n\nOf course, companies have no expectation that users will actually read, understand, or make rational and agentic choices about EULAs or TOS due to \\[impracticable time and expertise barriers\\](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3881776 or http:/dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3881776):\n\n> *“There is a vast discrepancy between the time required for the meaningful exercise of privacy self-management and people’s time constraints’ including gathering information, estimating its costs and benefits, and determining whether the expected consequences are compatible with their preferences…Additionally, data subjects have to repeat the process if they want to compare the terms of competing service providers. As it is not unusual for companies to frequently modify their privacy policies, studying them all just once would still not suffice…An average Internet user would need more than six full working weeks (244 hours) to read the privacy policies of every website visited in a one-year period, which would result in $781 billion of lost productivity in the U.S. alone. (Kröger, et al 2021)”*\n\nThose productivity estimates are conservative as they show 2008 figures, while the volume of combined worldwide digital activity has increased by several step functions. The purely performative practice of informed consent has nonetheless become a widespread convenient fiction that neutralizes public concerns and allows companies to satisfy compliance without meaningfully protecting privacy. As a result, companies have been incentivized to treat privacy as a legal condition to be met while ignoring the *intent* of privacy management: to preserve the moral autonomy, cognitive consent, and contextual boundaries of individuals whose unprotected digital telemetry leaves them vulnerable to surveillance and concealed influence.\n\n**The GDPR is yet another labyrinthine attempt to protect all privacy for users, all the time, across all technology environments, despite the obvious impossibility of achieving centralized protection for contextual needs. It also has the dubious honor of consent-washing you into a false sense of security by placing infuriating cookie popups between you and your enjoyment of the internet. These popups of course do nothing whatsoever to give you real choice or protect your privacy. They do, however, incentivize product designers to devise creative workarounds (see: [dark patterns](https://darkpatternstipline.org/)) to obscure your optionality and get you to consent to tracking out of sheer exasperation.**\n\nIn “[What’s wrong with the GDPR?](https://www.svensktnaringsliv.se/material/skrivelser/xf8sub_whats-wrong-with-the-gdpr-webbpdf_1005076.html/What%27s+wrong+with+the+GDPR+Webb.pdf)” authors Martin Brinne and Daniel Westman explain how the GDPR complicates application design that creates unnecessary user experience friction rather than protecting their privacy:\n\n> *“The challenges that businesses are facing is due, in large amount, to the GDPR’s often vague and difficult to interpret provisions…and a lack of guidance and uncertainty regarding international data flows. This leads to a level of uncertainty in many companies about what is applicable and how they should act. The broad scope and the desire to regulate all processing of personal data creates direct contradictions or at least tensions in relation to other regulations, that further complicates the application of the GDPR.” (2019)*\n\nA new framework built by the [XR Safety Initiative](https://xrsi.org/) in partnership with Georgia Institute of Technology extends this same prescriptive, centrally managed approach to emergent environments, layering further complexity on top of an already unworkable idea:\n\n> *“The XRSI Privacy Framework was inspired by the NIST privacy framework’s approach and was strategically designed to be compatible with existing U.S.-based and international legal and regulatory regimes and usable by any type of organization to enable widespread adoption. It explicitly considers key regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, FERPA , and a few others, as previously mentioned.” (2022)*\n\nAmong its other prescriptions, XRSI recommends that emergent technologies find ways to evolve that “satisfy CCPA and GDPR requirements” and “provide just-in-time disclosures to individuals and obtain their affirmatively expressed consent” (ibid). These preemptive restrictions extend the awkward user experience of disruptive, chaotic consent notification requirements into immersive digital worlds whose precise properties and interaction patterns have not even been invented yet!\n\nHow did we arrive at this point where consumers suffer the consequences of their own need for privacy protection, without having any meaningful say in it? It stems in part from a conflation between data handling and privacy management driven by the idea that privacy is too ill-defined, fuzzy, and ineffable a concept to concretize in practice. To rein in the uncomfortable ambiguity, framework developers abstracted away the “person” behind the data and broke privacy into more digestible components: data objects and transmission principles to be protected through information security practices.\n\nIn his 1998 essay “Re-Engineering the Right to Privacy,” Simon Davis foretells with stunning accuracy the shift from privacy protection to data protection that would take place through the development of technical frameworks instead of contextual, situation-specific, and user-driven rules to govern the handling of data. This shift offered “the illusion of voluntariness” by putting the onus of protecting privacy entirely on users without giving users any true choice, while at the same time neutralizing public concerns about surveillance and loss of privacy in technology-mediated life (1998, p. 144). As a result, companies have been incentivized and habituated to treat privacy as a legal condition to be satisfied and the assurance of confidentiality as an end goal in itself – while ignoring the applied intent of privacy management: to preserve the moral autonomy, cognitive consent, and shifting privacy boundaries of individuals leaving increasingly trackable and intermediated lives.\n\nUnfortunately, this trend of passing the buck on to consumers instead of dealing with privacy management from first principles is carrying on enthusiastically in crypto! The popular refrain echoed across crypto Twitter and Discord is “DYOR”, or “do your own research”. Little mind is paid to what is anecdotally obvious and empirically true: very few people possess the willpower, capacity, expertise, or spare time to pore over financial data or understand the code written in smart contracts to determine the privacy impact or the data exhaust left behind – and what story it might tell.\n\nWe continue to build with full knowledge of this glaringly obvious loophole: that requiring consent or awareness without actually expecting consent or awareness to exist (except as a checkmark provided under conditions of stress or exasperation) is merely a convenient fiction we have collectively constructed to sidestep the conceptual quagmire of meaningful privacy management. Because, technically, the terms are all there in the smart contract for anyone to read: all one has to do is do the research by examining the contract to fulfill consent.\n\nOf course, the entire paradigm of notice-and-consent privacy management was never intended to ascertain users’ true preferences or protect their sphere of cognitive autonomy. It is a kind of **consent theater** that gets the company over a legal hurdle to provide a certain service – and the user over the friction hurdle to obtain it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vCbry02fPE3fxogWDbaEN.png?height=2880&width=5120)\n\n**Consent theater is one of the key primitives that produces surveillance capitalism.** It is intuitive to understand why it is predatory – and why centralized governance such as NIST, GAPP, and GDRP or irresponsible conceptual shortcuts such as “DYOR” or “read the contract” are woefully inadequate. This practice would never meet the criteria for legal protection in a different context requiring consent: voluntary sexual acts between adults. If a person is too cognitively compromised or too young to grant consent, a defense such as “s/he said yes” would not stand. And yet, clicking “Yes” or “Accept” on a TOS or EULA is all that our privacy frameworks require to meet the legal threshold for informing users about their data and privacy rights and obtaining agreement to company terms.\n\nFinally, the idea that a binary choice between predetermined options constitutes an expression of agency and free will is absurd. This is especially so when opting out of a digital service means retreating from basic forms of interaction, learning, and socializing that constitute daily life in modern society. As Nissenbaum writes, “Some claim it is unfair to characterize a choice as deliberate when the alternative is not really viable; for instance, that life without a credit card, without a telephone, or without search engines requires an unreasonable sacrifice” (2010, p. 105). When opting out of a pervasive technology’s privacy scheme means opting out of the social contract and reverting to a pre-digital state of nature, then is this choice truly consensual -- or patently coerced?\n\nConsent cannot be considered freely given when valid alternatives to opting out do not exist. What, then, would it take to move technology from the current paradigm of consent theatrics towards a new model rooted in cognitive consent obtained through freely made, sovereign choices? What qualities might this framework have?\n\nUniversal, centralized, exogenous technical frameworks separate users from agency over their digital identities and data. They promulgate a deterministic conception of privacy that holds constant across all contexts, settings, environments, and technological futures. Realistic privacy governance would offer individuals latitude to modulate how much privacy they desire and when, and to respond in context to their shifting privacy boundaries. More privacy is not always preferable, nor is it always possible. Users might, for example, wish to simplify the labyrinthine process of collecting and transferring patient histories by lowering their privacy settings to quickly share relevant records between medical officers. On the other hand, users would almost certainly want more privacy for their Amazon purchasing history or before placing a large bid on an NFT.\n\nSince the only party with sufficiently rich information to make an agentic, context-informed choice is the individual in question, responsive privacy governance must center end users, not companies.\n\n## Part VII: The Urgency of Fixing Crypto Now\n\nTransparent public accounting of all transactions on distributed ledgers combined with expansive data collection on immersive inputs compound the scope of the surveillance problem in web3. Although the data itself is cryptographically secure and immutably available, blockchains’ privacy implications merit urgent attention. Infuriatingly little such attention is actually paid.\n\nIndeed, web3 has already encountered familiar privacy intrusion problems. DAOs, for example, struggle with preference falsification in governance proposals. If DAO voting members can see how others vote, their own expressions of preferences may change to fit in with the group. Instead of registering their true wishes, DAO voting members self-discipline for fear of opposing prevailing norms and losing social approval.\n\nIn DeFi, transaction transparency invites the risk of sandwich attacks. Since all participants can see the price of any trade, bad actors can manipulate outcomes by scanning protocols for pending transactions. Once found, attackers issue two orders: one just before the transaction and one right after. A successful attack artificially increases the price of the trade, generating profits for the attacker.\n\nWithin the metaverse, users will eventually find themselves in an immersive environment where every behavior – from how long they stare at an object to which users they interact with – becomes a data point for predictive modeling. The metaverse surface area for concealed influence increases by many orders of magnitude from what users experience today on social networks because augmented and virtual reality interfaces produce richer, more descriptive telemetry, including biometric markers.\n\nGaming is a particularly challenging usecase for privacy. Game designers focus a great deal of research on the development of addictive triggers that induce continuous gameplay by doling out rewards at unpredictable intervals and offering ever more challenging quests that increase with the player’s skill level. Precise behavioral data on players’ emotional responsiveness to specific triggers enables game designers to deliver exquisitely addictive and potentially harmful experiences in which the player is ill-equipped to express full agency and disrupt gameplay, even when consent to keep playing is declaratively given.\n\nBecause web3 alters the fundamentals about how people transact value and construct meaning, many observers ascribe to it all manner of unrealistic hopes, including the erroneous notion that users will own their data simply by opening the social graph and exiting extractive platforms that monetize attention. In fact, web3’s open data paradigm does not by itself to end surveillance capitalism because the primitives that drive surveillance capitalism – a missing user-centric identity layer, unchecked data exhaust, and consent theater – are all left unaddressed. **Even if we do away with centralized platforms altogether and shift all business to decentralized protocols, the only thing that changes is where user telemetry gets stored: in the cloud or on the public ledger.**\n\nIt is therefore frustrating that far too little such attention is paid. Or, even when privacy harms are noted, the issue is glossed over with the imagined optimism that since all data is public and not owned by a corporation, everything shakes out even in the end and becomes safe merely by virtue of being decentralized.\n\nThis is of course naïve, and happens for a few reasons:\n\n1. The space is still nascent and the harms still too theoretical to seem an imminent concern;\n2. A great deal of hype and excitement surrounds the space, which distracts from uncomfortable realities, earning those who bring up worthwhile criticism the unwelcome reputation of being harbingers of “FUD”, a disingenuous acronym used to discredit even educated skeptics as unbelievers; and\n3. Many builders in the space simply do not fully understand how privacy works, why it matters, and how to build with privacy in mind. This last group is likely very open to education and dialogue on the topic of how to build agentic technologies, and simply need access to useful resources and convincing arguments.\n\nBut crypto’s privacy-eroding harms are not lost on careful observers. Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of end-to-end encrypted messaging app, Signal, has written that “[it seems worth thinking about how to avoid web3 being web2x2 (web2  but with even less privacy) with some urgency](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html)” (2022). Vitalik Buterin, one of the cofounders of the Ethereum blockchain, has voiced similar sentiments in the [original ](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html)*[Soulbound](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html)*[ piece](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) that predates the current hype about soulbound tokens:\n\n> *“Privacy is an important part of making this kind of ecosystem work well. In some cases, the underlying thing…is already public, and so there is no point in trying to add privacy. But in many other cases, users would not want to reveal everything that they have. If, one day in the future, being vaccinated becomes \\[an NFT\\], one of the worst things we could do would be to create a system where the \\[NFT\\] is automatically advertised for everyone to see and everyone has no choice but to let their medical decision be influenced by what would look cool in their particular social circle. Privacy being a core part of the design can avoid these bad outcomes and increase the chance that we create something great.” (2022)*\n\nSimilarly, [a report by J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm/treasury-services/documents/opportunities-in-the-metaverse.pdf) highlighted the criticality of developing privacy standards to fully capitalize on the metaverse’s $1 trillion business opportunity:\n\n> *“Some key elements to support commerce and the meta-economy still need to be determined and scaled…to preserve privacy and enable digital freedom…User identification and privacy safeguards will be crucial for both interacting and transacting in the metaverse…Preservation of one’s ability to have multiple avatars/identities, with the addition of…private KYC/AML-compliant commerce and payments; verifiable credentials that can be easily structured to enable easier identification of fellow community/team members, or to enable configurable access to varying virtual world locations and experiences; \\[and\\] prevention against cyberbullying or online harassment/assault across virtual worlds. Expansion of NFT token-gated spaces \\[should\\] include the creation of private interactions, discussion and messaging.” (2022)*\n\nTo fully appreciate the enormity of the privacy challenge in the metaverse alone, it is important to understand just how much data becomes available for capture. David Nuti, a Vice President at Nord Security, [writes](https://venturebeat.com/2022/01/28/metaverse-vs-data-privacy-a-clash-of-the-titans/):\n\n> *“In an augmented reality environment, a company may want to serve me an advertisement for a couch because they can see in my augmented environment that my couch is kind of ratty in the background. Through artificial intelligence, they’ll serve me up a color of a new couch that matches the paint on the wall of my house. If I serve up an advertisement, it’s no longer knowing that I’m serving up the advertiser to the person, but how long my eyeballs are foc*used on that content.” (Preimesberger 2022)\n\nThis richness of data exhaust available to mine for psychological insights and predictive behavioral modeling is made possible through what is called biometrically inferred data:\n\n> “‘This enormou*s eye-tracking, gait-tracking the way you move, the way you walk – all this analysis – can infer a lot of information about you. And then there are the intersections of these other technologies, which is just like a brain-computer interface that will provide the alpha, beta, gamma – and even your thoughts – at some point. What happens to privacy when our thoughts are not even protected? All this information – stacked in cloud storage and constantly being analyzed by multiple buyers – could give companies a greater ability to understand individual traits,’ Pearlman said. An insurance company, for example, might see a behavioral clue inferring a customer’s health problem before the person notices anything herself. ‘Now, the data is in inferences.’” (ibid)*\n\nBiometrically inferred data traces its roots to affective computing, a field that began in 1997 at the MIT Media Lab:\n\n> *“\\[Affective computing aims\\] to combine facial expression with the computation of vocal intonation and other physiological signals of emotion that could be measured as behavior…Some emotions are available to the conscious mind and can be expressed ‘cognitively’ (‘I feel scared’), whereas others may elude consciousness but nevertheless be expressed physically in beads of sweat, a widening of the eyes, or a nearly imperceptible tightening of the jaw…The key to affective computing…was to render both conscious and unconscious emotion as observable behavior for coding and calculation. A computer…would be able to render your emotions as behavioral information. Affect recognition…is ‘a pattern recognition problem,’ and ‘affect expression’ is pattern synthesis.” (Zuboff 2020, pp. 284-285)*\n\nBiometrically inferred data and modern-day affective computing inherit and compound a privacy quagmire we have hardly begun to untangle, even when it is plain-old social media and cloud computing that is surveilling users and monetizing data exhaust for profit. This gets far more troubling when dealing with 3D immersive spaces.\n\nBut it is not too late. The urgency for better privacy governance in emerging technologies is never more pressing than exactly when the technology is being invented, if only because, as Langdon Winner famously wrote, “[the greatest latitude of choice exists the very first time a particular instrument, system, or technique is introduced](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/\\~beki/cs4001/Winner.pdf)” (1980). **Now would actually be the perfect time.**\n\nWhat would it take, then, to build a sufficiently robust privacy-protecting moat around every citizen on the blockchain, in the metaverse, and in any emergent digital environment such that the economic costs of surveillance capitalism become too onerous to remain commercially viable, regardless of the prevailing business model?\n\n**Decentralization will not address what our outdated privacy frameworks do not protect.** Unless we grapple with how technologies safeguard cognitive autonomy in context, we will invariably create the conditions for another Cambridge Analytica – this time in much more immersive and data-rich environments that would make the original scandal appear tame by comparison.\n\n## Part VIII: Reimagining Privacy and Identity Management\n\nGavison defines privacy as the degree of control that we have over others’ access to us through information, attention, and physical proximity (1980). She writes: “The requirement of respect for privacy is that others may not have access to us fully at their discretion” (ibid). A workable privacy scheme would empower users with cognitive access controls to modulate at their discretion – *and not at the discretion of the system, another user, or a third party* – how much they wish to share, with whom, and when. These access controls must somehow be fully manageable by users without requiring technical expertise or onerous time constraints to understand and evaluate their options, as with current theatrical notice-and-consent frameworks.\n\nFurther, there would seem to be a need for a great deal of flexibility to modulate these controls in response to ever-shifting contexts. There are many situations where less privacy is actually preferable. Users might, for example, wish to simplify the labyrinthine process of collecting and transferring a comprehensive patient history between medical offices by lowering their privacy settings to share relevant records between trusted professionals with minimal friction. On the other hand, users would almost certainly want more privacy for their Amazon purchasing history, before placing a very large bid on an NFT project, or, as Buterin suggests, to conceal the on-chain details about their vaccination status.\n\nNissenbaum offers precisely this dynamic view of privacy by disposing of the requirement for an all-encompassing definition. She shifts attention away from capturing privacy’s value and towards identifying conditions than maintain privacy expectations intact versus rupturing them. Her description of contextual integrity outlines “context-relative social norms…privacy is preserved when informational norms are respected and violated when informational norms are breached” (2010, p. 140).\n\nBurkert argues that privacy enhancing technologies should offer “systems for managing our various displays of personality in different social settings”, which he differentiates from the dominant informed consent approach that afflicts users today (1998, p. 128). This approach is:\n\n“…too often applied without sufficiently analyzing the range of ‘true’ choices available to the data subject…the degree of information provided, however, tends to vary widely, with the data subjects at a disadvantage because they cannot know how much they should know without fully understanding the system and its interconnection with other systems” (ibid).\n\n[As I have argued before](https://ana.mirror.xyz/OEs-8zTxfvllRSMrM4Zz7HZrlcD2bG9IgkO_bWaix-4), the quality of a privacy-protecting framework depends on “the degree of choice it affords to users to exercise agency about the sharing of their personal data. Its key feature would empower users to expand or contract their privacy settings with minimal friction and according to choices informed by surrounding context. Its key feature would not be how well the system safeguards personal information across all contexts” (Uglova 2022). In that essay, I distinguish between information security, which concerns itself with safeguarding PII wherever it transits or rests and regardless of context, and privacy protection, which concerns itself with maintaining coherence between consensual privacy boundaries and digital experience:\n\n> *“It may be counterintuitive to realize that PII does not hold intrinsic value, but that is because we are used to thinking in information security terms, where PII is used for a different purpose than digital advertising: Criminals want your data to engage in fraud, theft, espionage, and trafficking. This means that the data itself has some innate value, and a great lockbox keeps the criminals out. Advertisers want your data for an entirely different reason: to make predictions with it in order to influence your actions — and to do so as covertly as possible… If there were another, better way to accomplish influence without accessing your private data, they’d be game for that, too.” (2022)*\n\nPredictively, approaches driven by information security thinking naturally protect only the information, while leaving behind the person described by this information. As a result, users must accept privacy intrusions or opt out of modern digital life entirely.\n\nTherefore, it is the second-order effects of PII possession that concern privacy management: the formulation of concealed influence operations. We need to look at how contexts affect choice making, not how secure the PII is from prying eyes. We may have moved privacy out of innate moralism and into a rationalist utility based on values and harms experienced in context, but our privacy governance has yet to catch up because it continues to focus on prescriptive regulations for PII handling, security, and revocation across all contexts instead of variable access controls for in-the-moment choicemaking. Taking a cue from information security theory, which necessarily holds the value of PII constant across all contexts to protect it from any and all unauthorized intrusion, we retrofitted the same rigid idea onto privacy protection. A dynamic and flexible approach would have been more appropriate.\n\nUltimately, if the purpose of privacy management is to safeguard moral autonomy and cognitive consent in digital spaces, then a useful methodology for developing such controls must include the ability to modulate myriad privacy experiences and preferences across contexts at the user’s discretion, no matter how much variation in these variables. This is an ambitious request! We are contemplating the full expression and management of a comprehensive range of available choices across all systems while providing users with a granular understanding of their options and how they interact with other systems, so that users can assert their cognitive consent through conscious awareness.\n\nIf the goal is to return agency, moral autonomy, and cognitive consent to digital users, then users need the tools to modulate their own access controls and preferences across infinite contexts. An exhaustively descriptive and infinitely flexible expression of all possible choices across all systems and futures is impossible *only if* one considers building it in a centralized way, where governance takes place exogenously, outside the locus of the user, through universal practices and compliance requirements imposed from outside.\n\nBut people want different things. Exogenous, centralized privacy management cannot possibly give people the precise level of privacy they want for every digital interaction because that is tantamount to predicting the future. No fully descriptive scheme for comprehensive privacy management across all imaginable contexts can possibly give people exactly what they want. This idea is even less workable when those contexts are always shifting and when users’ privacy boundaries adapt in response to emergent properties of new technologies that are in a constant state of innovation and reinvention.\n\nThe only parties capable of formulating just-in-time responses to infinite environments, attributes, transmission principles, and contexts – and modulating how much signal they emit in response – are end users themselves. So, what would it look like if these controls were instead pushed down to the lowest level where context is most immediate and apparent? In other words, what if the controls belonged to the end user? Can this kind of radical decentralization and localization of privacy management be achieved?\n\n## Part IX: Out of the Conceptual Quagmire Towards Workable Governance\n\nA realistic model for managing privacy boundaries in context must center the user. It must furthermore be flexible, situationally adaptive, and capable of negotiating privacy boundary conditions and preserving context-relative social norms. These are the design requirements for the kind of robust privacy governance necessary to staunch the data exhaust that powers surveillance capitalism and threatens the hopes of the web3 community for a more symbiotic relationship between humans and their tools.\n\n\n---\n\n> *I use the word “symbiotic” intentionally to indicate that it is not only humans who progress and evolve through their tools, but also tools that progress and evolve as humans use them. A symbiotic relationship is characterized by mutuality, interdependence, and cooperation. As we inch closer to achieving artificial general intelligence, the quality of that relationship – and that it not devolve into predation in one direction or the other – becomes especially vital.*\n\n\n---\n\nThere is an obvious need, it seems, to shift away from centralized attempts to manage privacy by governing private data, behaviors, attributes, transmission principles, and experiences across all digital publics, and towards more flexible approaches that put users in control of their own choices. Instead of building better information security “lockboxes,” we need an approach to building consumer technologies that safeguards user cognition, decision-making, and autonomy against multiplicative forms of targeted limbic hijacking and manipulation. We need a methodology that can protect privacy boundaries across all contexts where it might encounter assaults to its integrity – that is to say, in constant daily encounters with digital life. It follows that this methodology should allow internet users to modulate the amount and type of digital exhaust they emit, and that they should be able to do this at their own discretion – as they see fit. Who better to show such discretion than the user herself?\n\nUnderlying the issue of a privacy management is a deeper question about identity management. And nearly every issue in privacy governance stems from the same original sin: the absence of self-owned, user-centric identity and access controls. We evolved effective identifiers for websites and endpoints, but not for the people using them. If individuals must manage their own privacy experience, we must first determine how identity preferences, expressions, and credentials are issued, by whom, where they are stored, how they are presented to others, and under what conditions.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8m5_2Pqawire1RL6fFp1x.png?height=2880&width=5114)\n\nFor users to interact with websites beyond the passive read-only era of the web that predated the age of social media and platform economics, companies began issuing local accounts with usernames and passwords. This **siloed** approach to digital identity meant that users had to create unique accounts for every site, leading to a poor user experience and creating massive breach liabilities for companies whose only interest was to grant users access, not to manage their accounts and PII. The prospect of getting out of the business of storing sensitive data and having to manage expensive cybersecurity schemes to fend off hackers became attractive to companies, who were happy to outsource the entire thing to bigger players with more ambitious plans for PII.\n\nThis gave rise to **federated identity,** an opportunity to both streamline fragmented user experiences across identity silos and monetize vast quantities of user telemetry for secondary use. Providers such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon entered the identity space to become the “trusted” middlemen of digital identity credentials, offering users a way log in with their pre-existing accounts while shifting the burden for information security assurance from fragmented businesses to collective federations equipped with the vast resources of technology platforms.\n\nImportantly, this centralization of identity into federations abstracted interaction and identity decisions away from users and their context. Users ended up with “[tens or hundreds of fragments of themselves scattered across different organizations, with no ability to control, update or secure them effectively](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-Inevitable-Rise-of-Self-Sovereign-Identity.pdf)” (Tobin, 2016), perfecting another of the essential conditions for surveillance capitalism.\n\nOnly internet users have the granular just-in-time context necessary to formulate an appropriate response to a consent moment, so, logically, privacy governance should reside within the individual’s purview. But absent the requisite identity layer to make such self-custody possible, digital identity shifted to the next available proxy: email addresses and social logins. Management of those digital identities likewise shifted to the custodians of those proxies: the technology companies issuing email and social login credentials. This awkward workaround for user-centric identity necessitated prescriptive and deterministic regulatory governance that, predictably, has failed to maintain the contextual integrity of users’ privacy boundaries while leaving companies to amass vast stores of user telemetry for exploitation by hackers and third parties.\n\nDecentralized or self-sovereign identity (SSI) is an approach to identity management that empowers users to self-custody their own identities, data, and privacy decisions. SSI can eliminate centralized middlemen and the overexposure of PII to federations by appending encrypted identity attributes to a user’s decentralized identifier, which only the user or a designated third party with the right public key can access. The flow of information between parties happens only with the cryptographic consent of the identity owner whose credentials are requested. In its ideal state, SSI allows users to “log in” to any product, service, game, metaverse, or protocol – irrespective of the user’s chosen identity tool or wallet – and to transact while minimizing data exchange.\n\nSSI provides an essential primitive for architecting a coherent privacy framework that centeres locus of control around the user. Although not yet in widespread use, a more stripped-down version of SSI has gained broad adoption: the crypto wallet. Providers such as MetaMask, Rainbow, Phantom, and Solflare offer wallets that interact with the Ethereum and Solana blockchains and allow users to make self-sovereign decisions. Because their usecases are limited to financial transactions and contract signatures – and because they are not interoperable between all blockchains, they are not fully-fledged SSI solutions for the management of a broad range of user attestations and preferences and across all digital surface areas. They are, however, a first step.\n\nSignificant obstacles stand in the way of ecosystem-wide adoption of user-centric identity. In order for an identity to be useful, trusted identity providers must agree to issue their credentials to the user’s identity or namespace, and verifying parties must be satisfied that the levels of assurance followed by issuers satisfy security criteria. But for identity providers to undertake the effort to develop credentials, the credentials themselves must first be accepted by enough verifying parties, or their usecase becomes too narrow to pursue. In turn, for credentials to see wide adoption, enough issuers must first agree to develop and issue them. This cold-start problem in decentralized identity requires urgent resolution, because absent user-centric identity management, the problems of federated identity will compound in web3.\n\nThe most obvious issue with overconfidence in web3’s ability to deliver users out of surveillance capitalism and right the wrongs of the platform economy is the transparency of on-chain transactions. While user-centric identity it is an important part of a privacy-first approach to technology, it is incomplete. SSI allows users to model and greatly reduce the aggregate signal that they emit every time they transact, but provides zero confidentiality for signals emitted once a smart contract is signed and entered into a public ledger. Those signals become public record and leave a traceable trail of remittances, holdings, purchases, and other transaction data for granular reconstruction of identity, modeling of behavior, and targeting of concealed influence to manipulate outcomes.\n\nAs such, solving for user-centric identity does not by itself provide a bulwark against surveillance capitalism. Neither does decentralization by sheer dint of being a new business model.\n\nAs previously established, surveillance capitalism is not business-model dependent. Platform economics certainly makes surveillance capitalism easier to implement because data is highly centralized and trivial to obtain. But the mere presence of a new model that supplants platform economics while leaving just as much data exhaust available for anyone collect, study, and model simply recreates surveillance capitalism with new economic incentives. Because most blockchains leave a publicly viewable record of every user transaction, the most critical component of a privacy-preserving framework – the confidentiality of private data – remains wholly unresolved.\n\nTo defend against surveillance capitalism, technology must deal with each of the primitives that invite it, including unprotected, widely available data exhaust. A workable solution for privacy management would therefore need to provide default confidentiality by obscuring the details of smart contract transactions or entirely breaking the link between interconnected public keys.\n\nA realistic framework must also solve for information overload and unrealistic time and expertise requirements that produce another key primitive for surveillance capitalism: consent theater. As shown, current notice-and-consent approaches that make users responsible for reading and comparing EULAs or “doing their own research” are purely performative. Accepting that reality is not the same as saying end users are lazy. It is merely a design requirement for realistic system architecture. Technologists should stop averting their eyes from this design constraint by perpetuating the convenient fiction that users can be experts. They can respond and declare preferences in context, but they will not compare technical terms or read contract code.\n\nThe time requirements to make informed choices exceed the time available to users – and would impose billions of dollars of productivity losses if users were to undertake this impossible task for every product and service that powers the global economy. No company is naïve enough to suggest that they even expect this of their users. Given the power asymmetry between teams of legal and compliance experts who write EULAs and TOS – or in the case of web3, the engineers who write smart contracts – these practices are intentional compliance theater and willful negligence of consent. If users were expected to examine, verify, and approve every single smart contract transaction individually, we would just recreate this compliance theater in web3.\n\nA workable framework would therefore need to provide some way to securely set and execute default preferences across categories of similar transactions or experiences without the user’s technical examination of every contract – while also protecting these groupings against exploitation by malicious code. Providers of digital products and services would, by extension, need to read and understand these default preferences and adjust the experience they provide accordingly instead of expecting users to be the ones to lower their privacy boundaries. Unless a user-centric identity scheme allows users to express default preference and consent groupings without getting bogged down in contract code – and with the assurance that companies will respect and comply with these user-defined preferences – a decentralized privacy framework is no less onerous than the centrally managed consent theater it replaces.\n\nFinally, how can we be sure these preferences are interoperably accepted and implemented? Broad and interoperable acceptance is a precondition for functional utility. If a user must repeatedly switch between multiple identity providers to access different products and services, reset privacy and consent preferences in accordance with the varying and non-interoperable options those products and services offer, and compare smart contracts to understand privacy impact, we go right back at square one: siloed identity and high-friction user experiences. Not good enough.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UGxVVNy9iGQaLgs41r_Gh.png?height=2880&width=5120)\n\n## Part X: A New Framework\n\nThis essay has shown how well-formulated information security principles permeated privacy thinking, a discipline that is distinct from information security and has very different governance needs, and for which those information security principles are maladapted. In so doing, the architects of privacy governance left consumer privacy less protected instead of better off.\n\nBut not all artifacts of information security theory should be discarded when developing a privacy-first framework. What if we were to take the same level of intellectual rigor that governs data security, and apply it to safeguard cognition and autonomy as well?\n\nCurrent privacy management schemes such as NIST and GAPP, as well as legal frameworks such as GDPR and CCPA fail because, while seeking to be maximally protective, they become excessively prescriptive. By focusing on the how of privacy management, they prioritize process and rules over guidelines and outcomes. Since it is impossible to govern and foresee all emergent contexts in advance, these overly prescriptive privacy schemes impose unintended consequences on end-users in the form of high-friction experiences and consent theater.\n\nRather than layering on more compliance rules written by people who do not necessarily understand the technologies they regulate, could a workable privacy-protecting framework be outcomes-based instead? Might we develop useful and uncomplicated guidelines that define desirable outcomes but allow engineers to do what they do best: innovate critical paths to arrive at those outcomes? Could we approach the task of developing privacy standards as design constraints instead of punitive restrictions retrofitted from the outside?\n\nFew technologists enjoy compliance – least of all the creatives and visionaries coding the cutting edge of innovation. The instinct is to push the boundaries of what is possible, not circumnavigate restrictive rules and contradictions. By repositioning privacy as an unexplored design space and communicating standards that function as design constraints instead of telling engineers how to do their jobs, we bring privacy management out of the world of legalese and into the native language of innovation.\n\nThis is precisely where privacy management can take a page from information security. Information security offers an outcome-based model designed to guide organizations and cybersecurity professionals to make sound data security decisions without telling them how to do their jobs. **This model is called the** **CIA Triad, which stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.**\n\n**Confidentiality** governs the encryption and protection of private data, objects, and resources from unauthorized viewing and access. **Integrity** is concerned with maintaining consistent, accurate, and trustworthy data across its lifecycle at rest and in transit. **Availability** requires that information remain accessible to authorized parties who can rely on access upon request.\n\nThe CIA Triad is a set of guiding principles for rigorous, outcomes-based judgement in rapidly-shifting cybersecurity contexts. Rather than promulgating a set of definitional rules, it invites practitioners to envision best- and worst-case scenarios, understand tradeoffs and interdependencies, and do their best instead of only doing exactly as they are told. What would the three dimensions of a privacy-focused CIA Triad look like?\n\n**For any kind of privacy management – whether siloed, federated, or decentralized – the ability to protect private information from unauthorized view or access is a prerequisite.** Without confidentiality, the data exhaust that becomes public record moves behavior extraction out of centralized platforms and into distributed ledgers, reconstructing the primitives of surveillance capitalism. Confidentiality, therefore, applies in privacy management as well as in information security.\n\n**Successful decentralized privacy management also requires interoperable optionality and data ownership without platform lock-in.** Internet users must be able to port their identity data, privacy preferences, and default settings between services, products, platforms, and protocols with minimal friction – and be likewise assured that those data, preferences, and settings will be read, accepted, and respected by any systems that interact with that user’s identity and data. **Interoperability is not just a technical challenge; it is truly an essential data sovereignty and privacy rights issue.** **Without interoperability, crypto reverts to the dominant paradigm of unrealistic expectations, convenient fictions, and compliance theater that arose out of platform economics and that powers today’s surveillance capitalism.**\n\nFinally, decentralized privacy management must empower users to exercise meaningful, pluralistic choice and cognitive consent with respect to the governance of their data, including how it is transferred and used by other parties and for what purposes. Unless users can make granular, context-based decisions about their privacy, we reconstruct the coerced consent of agree-or-opt-out dichotomies, which subvert agency with predetermined options driven by companies, not users. If using digital technology to transact, communicate, and interact is an indispensable precondition for participation in a global economy, then opting out is not an expression of sovereign agency but rather coerced resignation between two insufferable choices. If web3 is on track to supplant platform businesses as the prevailing digital means to coordinate, communicate, and transfer value, then pluralistic privacy options must replace the coerced consent that produces data exhaust and incentivizes surveillance capitalism. Agency, therefore, is the third pillar of the privacy CIA triad.\n\nWhat, then, is the current state of Confidentiality, Interoperability, and Agency in crypto?\n\n### Confidentiality\n\nTo mitigate the accumulation of sensitive telemetry on public ledgers, a privacy-preserving decentralized identity ecosystem would need to provide confidentiality by obscuring the details of smart contract signatures and blockchain transactions, or by altogether breaking the link between interconnected public keys. By taking advantage of selective disclosure and least privilege access, decentralized identity can help users reduce their cumulative data exhaust and make surveillance more time-intensive and less lucrative.\n\nAlmost all smart contract transactions, including purchases and sales of assets such as tokens and NFTs, liquidity staking, yield farming, and certain aspects of on-chain gaming are, by default, public. Grading the crypto ecosystem on confidentiality would yield almost universal zeros – with some notable exceptions.\n\nA number of players in crypto are innovating on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography, a technique that allows a party to prove that a statement is true without providing proof of the statement itself. For example, a requesting party such as a video streaming service might wish to ascertain that a user is over a certain age before providing access to content. The user may not wish to furnish sensitive identity documents (such as a passport or a driver’s license that also expose the user’s exact date of birth, addresses, and other private details) to a streaming company the user does not trust with all that personal data. For the user, such data overexposure is an obvious privacy risk. But even for the company, there is little upside in taking on the breach liability to securely store private account data to provide continuous service. Using ZKPs, users can prove that they meet certain criteria required for the transaction (such as an age threshold) without providing any extraneous details – not even the exact date of birth. Meanwhile, companies sidestep much of the honeypot risk of storing vast databases of user PII to attract hackers.\n\nFor surveillance capitalism to become too costly to remain commercially viable, scaled data aggregation must be met with obstacles onerous enough to make such efforts unprofitable. For this reason, identity wallets must store verifiable credentials off-chain and by default avail of ZKP (or other cryptographic techniques to mask the trail between addresses to protect user confidentiality) for every single interaction where a credential is furnished or user information is requested. **The key advantage of combining decentralized identity with off-chain storage and ZKP is that aggregate data exhaust becomes too variable – and the resulting behavioral model too incomplete and unreliable – to make surveillance commercially appealing.** **It would cost too much to build up enough data and pattern match enough transactions to reidentify users and create a behavioral model with sufficient fidelity for targeted influence.**\n\nIn DeFi, ZKP has enabled “coin mixers” such as Tornado Cash, L2s such as Aztec Network, and private currencies such as Zcash to provide what is called transactional privacy. Smart contracts can execute transactions because they are able to arrive at consensus that a certain criterion is met and that certain addresses are involved without needing to see, reveal, or record the details of those specifics on the ledger. All that is recorded is that the values are cryptographically true.\n\nZKP can be used to break the link between sending and receiving public keys, or to hash the link so that the trail becomes meaningless and impossible to reconstruct. However, ZKP is not the only way to provide blockchain privacy. Umbra is a coin mixer that uses ordinary elliptic curve cryptography to break the link between senders and receivers, while Monero relies on ring signature techniques to accomplish the same.\n\nSecret Network goes a step beyond transactional privacy to provide programmable privacy through the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which their white paper describes as a “[neutral party in the form of hardware for secure and private computations](https://scrt.network/graypaper)” (2022). Since facilitating transactions between senders and receivers is only one type of on-chain activity among many others, Secret offers a more “expansive” vision of blockchain privacy by using “encrypted inputs, encrypted outputs, and encrypted state, meaning we can enable groundbreaking new use cases for smart contracts and decentralized applications….allowing for a wide degree of flexibility with both design and implementation choices” (ibid).\n\nClearly, there is growing acknowledgement of the criticality of stemming the accumulation of data exhaust that powers concealed influence by providing default-confidential, privacy-preserving crypto primitives. Unfortunately, these solutions have not yet seen widespread adoption and present significant barriers to entry to onboard mainstream users who lack both the privacy awareness and technical expertise to make privacy-enhancing technologies a foundational part of their crypto stack. Given a choice between privacy and convenience, users will invariably choose convenience every time.  **For confidentiality to become the blockchain norm and not the exception, the responsibility for making privacy-preserving design and system architecture choices falls on crypto developers and founders, not users.**\n\n### Interoperability\n\nThe key feature of platform data capture is platform lock-in that prevents users from taking their data and leaving. Platform businesses devote significant resources to building data moats by expanding their footprint while displacing or subsuming competitors, so that consumers are left without meaningful choice as to how or where to live their digital lives.\n\nInteroperability is therefore a precondition for ecosystem-wide adoption of decentralized identity, which requires that all companies, applications, protocols, and platforms agree to use a common set of data rails and not lock users into their own proprietary ways of handling identity-related assets, consent preferences, and access controls.\n\nA familiar way to think about interoperability is having all email providers using the same Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), without which we could not communicate between servers. Such platform-agnostic compatibility is critical because it not only eliminates silos but alleviates the information overload and unrealistic time and expertise requirements that arise when users are asked to consent to TOS and EULAs  (or, in the case of blockchains, to “do their own research” by reading smart contract code, a popular and cynical version of the notice-and-consent paradigm that is emerging in Web3). Users cannot and will not read technical agreements; nor will they ever become privacy experts – and not because they are lazy but because the idea itself is impractical. This is a design constraint that technologists must stop ignoring, minimizing, and sidestepping.\n\nFor decentralized, privacy-preserving identity to provide value, users would need ways to “set and forget” default preferences across categories of similar transactions and experiences without getting bogged down in code and contracts – while also protecting these groupings against exploitation by malicious code. Digital products and services would, by extension, be obligated to read and abide by these default preferences, adjusting the experience they provide accordingly instead of expecting users to lower their privacy boundaries. Unless the entire ecosystem operates on mutually-readable, standardized data rails, decentralized identity will not be an improvement over the consent theater of federated identity that it replaces.\n\nIf user preferences and default settings need to interoperate across all products, services, and protocols to minimize friction, productivity losses, and consent theater, then products, services, and protocols need to be able to read each other’s code and data rails. Ironically, blockchain protocols cannot easily talk to each other or to the outside world without introducing significant security vulnerabilities, posing a major barrier to wider adoption of crypto. As a result, value and information are fractured across multiple blockchains that do not interoperate with each other or communicate state with off-chain systems.\n\nA number of crypto players are exploring the potential of oracles and bridges to address the inconvenience that composable code yields applications that cannot actually interoperate. Chainlink is a company that builds oracle networks to enable smart contracts to communicate with off-chain resources, such as APIs. Meanwhile, Cosmos is focused on improving interoperability by bridging through the interblockchain communication protocol, similar in principle to TCP/IP. Unfortunately, solutions that attempt to connect blockchains present risks in asset transfer and contagion, among many others [as noted by Buterin](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/):\n\n> *“Imagine what happens if you move 100 ETH onto a bridge on Solana to get 100 Solana-WETH, and then Ethereum gets 51% attacked. The attacker deposited a bunch of their own ETH into Solana-WETH and then reverted that transaction on the Ethereum side as soon as the Solana side confirmed it. The Solana-WETH contract is now no longer fully backed, and perhaps your 100 Solana-WETH is now only worth 60 ETH. Even if there’s a perfect ZK-SNARK-based bridge that fully validates consensus, it’s still vulnerable to theft through 51% attacks like this… The problem gets worse when you go beyond two chains. If there are 100 chains, then there will end up being dapps with many interdependencies between those chains, and 51% attacking even one chain would create a systemic contagion that threatens the economy on that entire ecosystem.”*\n\nUltimately, crypto interoperability depends as much on will as on technical feasibility and risk mitigation. Companies have to align on standards and people have to *choose* to build interoperable protocols and applications and solve for the attendant security risk.\n\n### Agency\n\nThe primacy of adaptable, context-dependent privacy governance is never more apparent than in the need for localized access controls to cognition. For users to become the ultimate arbiters of their online lives, they must be able to modulate their privacy boundaries entirely at their discretion, requiring a rich menu of controls to adapt their privacy preferences in response to shifting norms and surrounding context.\n\nWith interoperably accepted, default-confidential, user-centric identity, users control information flows in response to context. As such, they are fully empowered both informationally and technologically to react situationally and make context-informed decisions about their privacy boundaries. This calls for clear, easily navigable user interfaces that present transparent controls to expand or contract their privacy options. Since very little interaction design research has been conducted on self-sovereign avatar interfaces and identity wallets, this is an area of web3 that is ripe for innovation and invention.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2kwGXgQCdAv-_WCc5QMyf.png?height=2880&width=5120)\n\n## Part XI: Caveat Emptor\n\nThis paper has focused on one crucial building block for a different future in which we might live well with the tools we build: consumer privacy. But privacy is not the only building block.\n\nTwo critical areas that were specifically outside the scope of this paper were law enforcement and consumer trust and safety.\n\nCrypto critics accuse it of many things – a get-rich-quick Ponzi scheme, a passing fad, and a convenient method for laundering money and hiding from the law. The recommendations of this essay do not look to create irrevocable privacy and offer no point of view on government surveillance, whether legitimate or illegitimate. The scope of the recommendations offered is limited strictly to making surveillance capitalism too costly for *commercial* entities. But failing to mention law enforcement interests seems irresponsible.\n\nWhile crypto has been used to evade law enforcement, so, frankly, has cash. A wholesale rejection of a tool because one of its usecases is objectionable does not withstand logical scrutiny. However, that does not mean that the ecosystem should ignore its critics; crypto must deal seriously with its shadowy side if it hopes to onboard more users. Are there, for example, ways to report on or trace confidential transactions that may be connected to a crime without compromising privacy for the vast majority of crypto’s compliant users? Can KYC schemes – regulations intended to prevent money laundering, but which unintentionally deny access to crucially-needed financial services to billions of unbanked customers lacking identity – be redesigned to be more inclusive and compliant?\n\nPanther Protocol, for example, is designed as an “end-to-end solution that restores privacy in \\[crypto\\] while providing financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in decentralized finance” (n.d.) Their [white paper](https://pantherprotocol.io/resources/panther-protocol-v-1-0-1.pdf) offers ideas for further research:\n\n> *“In the developed countries, the current compliance regime operates under something akin to a guilty unless proven innocent presumption. Segments of society are denied access to financial services. Customers’ Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and transaction data are by default collected, stored, data-mined for patterns and subject to sharing with third parties and authorities…The problem with traditional compliance stems from the assumption that in order to detect financial crime, it is necessary to gather and analyze large amounts of raw data. However, with the advancement of computer science and mathematics, this assumption no longer holds true.” (2021)*\n\nPanther is by far not the only crypto player working to provide a path to compliance, despite the overall combative stance adopted by most lawmakers toward crypto. [As I have written elsewhere](https://ana.mirror.xyz/Is5u-zode1yltjL6QqgElcr4jgdiJpdOh_1bv2BRMSI):\n\n> *“Findora, for example, ‘envisions a world where financial networks are compliant and publicly auditable at all times” and which aims to “prevent fraud and make compliance with regulations easier through the use of auditability tools, without sacrificing privacy’. Horizen is a protocol focused on ‘auditable transparency with privacy’. And Zcash, a popular privacy coin, is specifically ‘designed to protect consumers’ financial privacy while retaining compatibility with global AML/CFT standards’.” (Uglova, April 2022)*\n\nPioneering research is also being done in [zero-knowledge KYC](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/321.pdf) that issues designated entities (such as government agencies) a token key to reveal identifying information encrypted in a ZK proof upon compelling evidence of malicious activity (Pauwels et al., 2022).\n\nAnother topic that merits urgent attention as we spend more time online in increasingly immersive environments is trust and safety. Already, we have seen [cases of toxicity, bullying, and harassment in the metaverse](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/30/technology/metaverse-harassment-assaults.html) (Frenkel & Browning, 2021). Important work in this field is being pioneered by companies such as Spectrum Labs, which provides AI-powered content moderation services to technology companies. Tiffany Zingyu Wang, an executive at Spectrum Labs, recently founded OASIS Consortium, a think tank that provides [thought leadership, education, advocacy, and ethics standards focused on building safe online communities, including the metaverse](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/20/1043843/safe-metaverse-oasis-consortium-roblox-meta/) (Basu, 2022).\n\n## Part XII: Conclusion\n\n*“Privacy is necessary for free expression, for diversity of interactions and identities, and often for safety, and yet it has become a luxury good, with privacy-preserving technologies remaining the preserve of those with knowledge or capital, not the default. – [Pluriverse](https://pluriverse.world/) (Chang et al, 2022)*\n\nPerhaps one reason that engineers and technology companies are often negligent about protecting privacy – that is, until citizens and tech activists get up in arms and governments force them to act –  is that it feels punitive to have to do it. What a drag. Nobody likes being told what to do – least of all a young engineer attracted to the space by the possibility of testing what can be built, rather than studying what can’t.\n\nNevertheless, any new iteration of the web must be built with privacy in mind – at least if our collective intent is to make digital technology better, less adversarial, and more humane. **Or else, why are we even bothering with all the additional complexity and compute of decentralization, if we’re just going to rearchitect the same surveillance capitalism on new rails? What will have been the point?**\n\nIf the incentive in technology culture is to push the envelope, then let’s change the envelope.\n\nThis essay aims to stimulate exactly this discourse about the edges of the agentic design space among the engineers, founders, and visionaries building web3. In so doing, it hopes to elevate privacy out of the realm of academia and the notoriety of ineffectual, retroactive, and counterproductive compliance, and reignite the creative potential for technological innovation and fresh thinking in this poorly understood, urgently needed, and long neglected space.\n\nDeterministic, exogenous privacy frameworks not only limit the possibility space for invention, but quickly fall out of relevance as system designers devise creative workarounds that most often take the form of high-friction user experiences. This is especially true of web3, a space that is experiencing rapid innovation, consequences that fall outside the scope of existing governance, and impact that reaches beyond narrowly intended “ideal customers” to affect future generations and those “not in the room” where design decisions are made.\n\nBlockchains do not by default address the harms that pervade our dominant platforms because most of those harms are rooted in ineffective privacy protections and poorly designed identity management, not extractive business models. The promise of a new business model does not by itself address the underlying primitives that create surveillance capitalism: digital identities abstracted from their true owners, data exhaust that leads to behavior tracking and aggregation, and consent theater that masquerades as choice. The business model of attention-driven economics is merely a symptom of surveillance capitalism, not its source. So long as the surplus telemetry that emerges from ineffective and outdated privacy frameworks and identity governance enables the monetization of data exhaust for commercial gain, surveillance capitalism will persist.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oa705qP1QtuKQ9jsRcll_.png?height=2880&width=5120)\n\n**If we ignore these failure modes now, there will be no material difference between the extractive web of today and the decentralized version that hopes to supplant it. Unless we architect web3 with users at the center, there will be no material difference between extractive platform businesses and the decentralized versions that hope to supplant them. Systematic commercialization of attention will merely shift from platforms to protocols, yielding the same predations we have grown weary of today, indistinguishable except in degree: reidentification, targeting, and concealed influence in even more immersive, inescapable, pervasive, and immutable forms.**\n\nOne of the many challenges in privacy management up to this point has been a reluctance in the engineering community to build with privacy in mind. The roots of this compliance puzzle stem from a rationalist Western school of thought that values privacy consequentially – in terms of harms and benefits accrued – while managing it centrally and universally – through essentialist and impossibly prescriptive governance that imagines the proper handling of every kind of PII across all contexts and situations. As a result, privacy has been treated as a punitive compliance puzzle instead of a creative, inviting, and inspiring design challenge.\n\nIn her analysis of how technological innovation veered off course into surveillance capitalism, the first reason Zuboff gives is that the change was unprecedented:\n\n> *“Most of us did not resist the early incursions of Google, Facebook, and other surveillance capitalist operations because it was impossible to recognize the ways in which they differed from anything that had gone before. The basic operational mechanisms and business practices were so new and strange, so utterly sui generis\\*, that all we could see was a gaggle of ‘innovative’ horseless carriages. Most significantly, anxiety and vigilance have been fixed on the known threats of surveillance and control associated with state power. Earlier incursions of behavior modification at scale were understood as an extension of the state, and were not prepared for the onslaught from private firms.” (2020, p. 340)*\n\nBut we are no longer swimming in uncharted waters, unsure of what the future of technology holds. Today, we have the benefit of historical hindsight and no defensible reason to operate willfully blind to the lessons of the past.\n\nWhile web3 exposes users to more risk, it presents a unique opportunity to abandon outmoded frameworks in favor of identity and privacy schemes that center individual autonomy and agency. This is an opportunity that nobody, least of all those building web3, can afford to ignore.\n\nWe really have no more excuses.\n\n## References\\]\n\nAICPA. Privacy Management Framework.

(مالکیت فردی توکنیزه شده بر یک پیام اجتماعی) \n این مفهوم با ایردراپ کاملا متفاوت است، به عنوان مثال مقالات منتشر شده در پلتفرم “میرر” بصورت “ان اف تی” در بلاکچین ثبت میشوند و مخاطبان یک مقاله میتوانند درصورت خوش‌آیند یک نسخه از مقاله را در کیف پول خود مینت کنند. که این کار میتواند حکم منبع اصلی درآمد نگارنده را باشد(فروش مقاله) یا دونیت کردن خوانندگان بعنوان مشوق برای تولید محتوای بیشتر. این همان مفهوم مالکیت توکنیزه شده نگارنده بر مقاله است که به آن اشاره کردیم، اما برای ایردراپ، نگارنده مقاله و مخاطبی که مقاله را مینت میکند هر دو شانس این را دارند که از ایردراپ احتمالی این پلتفرم سود ببرند؛ هرچند که شانس نگارنده مقاله بعنوان تولید کننده محتوا بیشتر خواهد بود.\n\n**مستقل و خودگردان**\n\nدر کنار توزیع مالکیت، توزیع قدرت تصمیم گیری نیز وجود دارد. بدون یک مرجع تصمیم گیرنده مرکزی، بلاک چین ها برای تأیید یک فعالیت از طریق اجماع به کل شبکه متکی هستند. با این حال، سیستم‌های خاصی مانند سیستم‌هایی که در سازمان‌های خودگردان غیرمتمرکز(دائو) استفاده می‌شوند، می‌توانند برای دموکراتیک کردن تصمیم‌گیری بر اساس کیفیت یا حجم سرمایه‌گذاری کاربر در یک شبکه، سایت یا برنامه ایجاد شوند.\n\nبرای مثال، بر اساس سهمی که از مالکیت یک پلتفرم دارند، کاربران می‌توانند به قوانین حاکم بر یک شبکه(مانند شبکه لایه دوم آپتیمیزم) رأی دهند (مثلاً تغییر کارکرد توکن حاکمیتی). سپس این قوانین توسط قراردادهای هوشمند اجرا می شوند.\n\n#### وب 3 در ابتدای راه است\n\nدر حالی که چندین برنامه “وب 3 ” وجود دارد، هیچ زیرساخت گسترده “وب 3 ” مانند اینترنت فعلی وجود ندارد. قبل از تحقق چشم انداز “وب 3 ”، اگر اصلاً محقق شود، به توسعه گسترده، تثبیت و تلاش های قابل دسترسی نیاز است.\n\nملاحظات زیادی برای پذیرش گسترده وجود دارد، به این معنی که “وب 3 ” ممکن است به تبلیغات وعده داده شده عمل نکند. سوالاتی مانند اینکه آیا “وب 3 ” می تواند به طور پایدار مقیاس بندی شود؟ آیا “وب 3 ” واقعاً حاکمیت آنلاین را ارائه می دهد؟ آیا می‌توانیم فرهنگ توده‌ها را به درک “وب 3 ” تغییر دهیم؟\n\nهیچ پاسخ تک کلمه ای برای این سؤالات وجود ندارد، اما ما مشتاقانه منتظریم تا در رشتو های آینده به این مسائل بپردازیم.\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1657372928, "digest": "H8xS5LL-sf_IgyB0o2L2EBbZTCm4sa21cZ6VBEAX828", "contributor": "0xa3dF90Bf8E8183A74b537B27e3955BA7D8De199c"}

{"id": "T1xbWsSonUxFQwbE77Y8nsZRWv0Eag9GvZ4oYMcsc80", "title": "BLS Signature Aggregation: Under the Hood", "body": "*This is the second part of a series of articles explaining how cryptography in Ethereum works. The article assumes prior knowledge about Elliptic Curve Cryptography covered in the [previous article](https://mirror.xyz/0x6afeB3d9E380787e7D0a17Fc3CA764Bb885014FA/SJwdsUSOBEDOYDdBwIsw46Ma8FfBEy9KTeU3Cskt68g). We cover the absolute basics of BLS signatures and how their aggregation works.*\n\n\n---\n\nDigital signatures play a big role in blockchains. A message that is digitally signed guarantees two things:\n\n* **Message authenticity:** Evidence that a specific sender (owner of a private key) has created and signed the message.\n* **Message integrity:** Evidence that a message has not been tampered with after it was signed.\n\nDigital signatures aren't new and they've been there since the dawn of public key cryptography. However, recent advances in [Pairing-Based Cryptography](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/\\~ajmeneze/publications/pairings.pdf) have had a significant impact on the Consensus Layer's design.\n\nA digital signature is used every time a user sends a transaction on Ethereum. This is done at the transactional level. At the consensus level, digital signatures are not employed in the current Proof of Work Ethereum. In PoW protocols, a block only needs to have the right hash to indicate that it was mined correctly; the miner's identity is irrelevant, hence no signature is required.\n\nValidators in the PoS Ethereum system are identifiable and accountable for their actions. We require validators to make attestations and blocks to be uniquely recognizable to enforce the [Casper FFG](https://medium.com/unitychain/intro-to-casper-ffg-9ed944d98b2d) rules and count votes for the[ LMD GHOST](https://ethresear.ch/t/bitwise-lmd-ghost/4749) fork choice.\n\nSince a digital signature permanently links the sender of a message to its contents, it can be used to prove and penalize a validator who has been acting maliciously. This functionality can also be utilized outside of the protocol – for example, as an anti-spam measure, signatures are validated by nodes in the gossip layer before being forwarded.\n\nTo digitally sign user transactions, the Execution Layer (like most blockchains) uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECDSA signatures are short (65 bytes) and verified in a matter of milliseconds. The Consensus Layer is designed in such a way that it can operate on a far bigger scale than standard blockchains. It requires validators to add signatures to their blocks so that other users or validators may verify the block's authenticity. Validators also sign their other actions on the Beacon chain with their signatures.\n\nThere can be situations where hundreds of thousands of signatures might need to be verified within a single epoch. If we use ECDSA, it would take us nearly 30 minutes to verify a million signatures – this wouldn't be good enough for the Beacon chain.\n\n## ECDSA: Not Good Enough for PoS\n\nA large number of protocol messages must be handled by proof of stake protocols. Over 780 attestations gossip globally every second on the Beacon Chain, which now has almost 400,000 active validators. The figure of 780 is simply an average; there can be much higher surges. These digital signatures must be confirmed by each node in addition to traveling over the network, which is a computationally intensive operation. These signed communications must be saved in the block history as well. In most Proof of Stake networks, these conditions severely limit the number of validators.\n\nThe initial design for post-PoS Ethereum was laid out in early 2018 by [EIP-1011](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1011.md). The proposal focused on on-chain PoS management and estimated that the protocol could only handle a maximum of around 900 validators due to the high message overhead. A hefty stake size of 1500ETH per validator was set. This was problematic as it would increase centralization.\n\nJustin Drake's article titled [Pragmatic Signature Aggregation with BLS](https://ethresear.ch/t/pragmatic-signature-aggregation-with-bls/2105?u=benjaminion) came out in May 2018 and changed the course of Ethereum's move to PoS.\n\n## The Solution\n\nDrake suggested adopting [Boneh-Lynn-Shacham](https://crypto.stanford.edu/\\~dabo/pubs/papers/BLSmultisig.html), or BLS, a novel signature scheme developed by Stanford researchers. It can aggregate many digital signatures into one while keeping each validator accountable. Aggregation not only cut down on the number of individual messages that needed to be passed across the network, but it also cut down on the expense of verifying the messages' integrity.\n\nIn terms of use, the BLS signature technique is similar to ECDSA, although it is quite different mathematically. They feature two distinct characteristics that aren't found in other signature schemes:\n\n* **Any number of signatures on any number of messages can be combined into a single signature with a constant size.** Although these signatures are larger (96 bytes) than ECDSA signatures, this means we no longer need to dedicate megabytes of space in blocks solely to signatures.\n* **Any number of signatures on the same message can be verified in constant time.** It takes roughly the same time to verify a million aggregated signatures on the same message as a single signature on that message. This is advantageous in the Consensus Layer as validators often sign the same messages (say, a given block).\n\nBecause of this signature aggregation feature, we decided to drop EIP-1011 and go with the Beacon chain model we have now. It makes the Consensus layer possible and allows the Beacon Chain to scale to hundreds of thousands of validators.\n\n*Note: BLS Signatures are only a temporary solution to this problem.*\n\n***Trigger warning: Math;*** it is optional and there is no test at the end. But give it a few minutes and you’ll understand everything better.\n\n## Elliptic Curve Pairings\n\nBLS makes use of \"**pairing**,\" a special property of some elliptic curves. A pairing is a function e that outputs an element in a finite field from a pair of two points on an elliptic curve. The pairings we consider are also bilinear. This bi-linearity property has enabled the development of new cryptographic methods based on pairings.\n\nTheoretically, all elliptic curves have pairings, but there are some curves with pairings that are not suitable for cryptographic applications in practice. So how do we go about choosing curves for pairing-based cryptography?\n\nThe embedding degree *k* is a parameter associated with each elliptic curve that we can calculate. We need *k* to be a small value (certainly less than 100) to employ curves to efficiently develop pairing-based cryptography. Because nearly all elliptic curves have a very big *k*, which is usually the same as the field modulus *q*, such curves are difficult to find (at least 160 bits). There are two approaches to finding pairing-friendly elliptic curves:\n\n1. Use curves that always have *k* ≤ 6, called **supersingular elliptic curves**.\n2. Use **complex multiplication** to construct certain families of elliptic curves with small *k*.\n\nBoth of these approaches have certain [tradeoffs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730686/#b5-jres.120.002).\n\nTo construct pairing-based cryptographic protocols, we must also specify a specific pairing function *e.* The two most commonly used pairings are Weil and Tate. Researchers have come up with several innovative pairings to speed up computation as time has passed. It's vital to know that the various pairings aren't interchangeable.\n\nElliptic curve cryptography relies on the difficulty of the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) and the [Computational Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_problem#:\\~:text=The%20Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman%20problem%20(DHP,compute%2C%20but%20hard%20to%20reverse) Problem(CDHP). Both these problems have been well studied and carefully chosen parameters for the elliptic curves make the cryptographic scheme secure. Pairing based cryptography relies on another security assumption called the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem (BDHP).\n\nNote: Read Vitalik Buterin’s article about Elliptic Curve Pairings [here](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/exploring-elliptic-curve-pairings-c73c1864e627) to get a better understanding of the topic.\n\nBDHP hasn't been well studied as it's a much newer problem. If one can solve the DLP or the CDHP, then one can also solve the BDHP. As a result, pairing-based cryptography does not have stronger security than elliptic curve cryptography. At present, there are no known attacks that can break the BDHP.\n\n\n---\n\n## BLS Signatures\n\nThe Beacon chain uses Boneh-Lynn-Shacham or BLS signatures with the [BLS12-381](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/bls12-381) elliptic curve. BLS utilizes the \"[pairing](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/exploring-elliptic-curve-pairings-c73c1864e627)\" property of certain elliptic curves. Although BLS signatures are a lot slower than ECDSA signatures, they can be aggregated together and are efficient to verify at a large scale. This signature aggregation allows the Beacon Chain to scale to hundreds of thousands of network participants.\n\n### Components\n\nThere are four key components within the BLS digital signature scheme:\n\n1. **The secret or private key:** is the key used by participants to sign messages and must not be shared with anyone.\n2. **The public key:** is uniquely derived from the private key; the private key cannot be calculated using the public key. The public key represents identity in a protocol and is known to everybody.\n3. **The message:** is a string of bytes.\n4. **The signature:** is created by combining the message with the private key. A digitally signed message can be verified using the public key corresponding to the secret key used to sign the message.\n\nThe underlying math involves using 2 subgroups of the BLS12-381 elliptic curve: *G₁* is defined over a base field *Fᵩ*, and *G₂* is defined over the field extension *F*ᵩ₁₂ . The order of both the subgroups is r, which is a 77-digit prime number. The generator of *G₁* is *g₁* , and of *G₂* is *g₂* .\n\n1. The secret key *sk* is a number between 1 and *r*. Small values of *r* are impractical for cryptographic purposes.\n2. The public key *pk* is *\\[sk\\]g₁* (the square brackets represent scalar multiplication of elliptic curve group point). The public key is a member of the *G₁* group.\n3. The message *m* is a string of bytes and can be of an arbitrary length. It is hashed to a fixed-length *H(m)*, a member of the *G₂* group.\n4. The signature *σ* is a member of the *G₂* group, namely *\\[sk\\]H(m)*\n\n### Key Pairs\n\nA key pair consists of a secret key along with its corresponding public key. The secret key is randomly generated in a secure environment and the public key is uniquely determined from the private key. Key pairs are commonly stored in password-protected keystore files. [EIP-2335](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2335.md) specifies the JSON format for the storage and interchange of BLS12-381 private keys.\n\nThe secret key *sk* is a 32-byte unsigned integer. It is a common practice to drop the y-coordinate of elliptic curve points to halve the amount of data stored. The same is done for the private key *pk*, which is a point on *G₁*.  For BLS12-381, *G₁* points are reduced from 96 bytes ( 2 \\* 381 bits) to 48 bytes.\n\n### Choice of Groups\n\nThe *G₁* and *G₂* groups are interchangeable when it comes to digital signatures. We can opt to have our public keys belong to *G₁* and our signatures belong to *G₂* or vice versa.\n\nThe tradeoffs are execution speed and storage space. *G₁* has small points and is fast, *G₂* has large points and is slow. BLS12-381 was developed to implement Zcash, and they picked *G₁* to represent signatures and *G₂* to represent public keys for performance reasons.\n\nIn the consensus layer, we use *G₁* for public keys since the aggregation of signatures happens a lot more than the aggregation of public keys. Another reason for doing so is public keys of validators need to be stored in state, so keeping the representation small is important. Signatures are *G₂* points.\n\n### Signing\n\nOnly [hash tree roots](https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/building_blocks/merkleization) of objects, or their so-called signature roots, which are 32-byte strings, are signed in the beacon chain protocol. We then need to map the signing root onto an elliptic curve point in the *G₂* group. For a message with a signing root *m*, the point is *H(m)*. Here, *H* is a function that maps bytes to *G₂*.\n\nOnce we have *H(m)*, the signing process is rather straightforward. The signature *σ* will be the scalar multiplication of *H(m)* by the secret key.\n\n*σ = \\[sk\\]H(m)*\n\nThe signature *σ* is also a member of the *G₂* group. It is 96 bytes long in its compressed form.\n\n### Verifying\n\nThe public key of the validator who signed a message is required. Every validator's public key is stored in the Beacon state and can be retrieved easily using the validator's index, which is always available.\n\nWe require the message, the public key, and the signature of the validator who signed the message to validate a signature. The verification method yields a boolean value indicating whether the signature is legitimate or not.\n\nIn the BLS12-381 curve, a pairing simply takes points *P* and *Q*, where *P*∈ *G₁* and *Q* ∈ *G₂ ,* and outputs a point from a group *Gₜ*  ⊂ *F*ᵩ₁₂ . Hence, for a pairing *e*,  *e*: *G₁* × *G₂ → Gₜ*.\n\nPairings are usually denoted like *e*(*P*, *Q*) and have special properties. If we have two points *P* and *S* in *G₁ ,* and *Q* and *R* in *G₂* ,\n\n* *e(P, Q+R) =  e(P,Q) ⋅  e(P, R)*, and\n* *e(P+S, R) =  e(P, R) ⋅  e(S, R)*\n\nBy convention, *G₁*  and *G₂* are written as additive groups and *Gₜ* as multiplicative. The ⋅ operator is point multiplication in *Gₜ.*\n\nUsing this, we can deduce that all of these identities hold\n\n*e*(\\[*a*\\]*P*, \\[*b*\\]*Q* ) = *e*(*P*, \\[*b*\\]*Q* ) a  = *e*(*P*, *Q*) *ab* = *e*(*P*, \\[*a*\\]*Q*) *b* = *e*(\\[*b*\\]*P*, \\[*a*\\]*Q*)\n\nUtilizing pairings, we can easily verify a signature. The signature is valid if and only if *e*(*g*1 , *σ* ) = *e*(*pk*, *H*(*m*))\n\nHence, given the message *m*, the public key *pk*, the signature *σ*, and the fixed generator *g₁* of the *G₁* group, we can verify that the message was signed by the secret key *sk*.\n\nWe’re only making use of the identity from the properties of pairings we’d seen above.\n\n*e*(*pk*,*H*(*m*)) = *e*(\\[*sk*\\]*g*1, *H*(*m*)) = *e*(*g₁* , *H*(*m*))(*sk*)  = *e*(*g₁*, \\[*sk*\\]*H*(*m*)) = *e*(*g₁*,*σ*)\n\nThe verification returns True if and only if the signature corresponds both to the public key of the signing validator (i.e. the signature and the public key were both generated from the same secret key) and to the message (i.e. the message is identical to the original signed message). Otherwise, it returns False.\n\n### Aggregation\n\nSo far, what we’ve covered about BLS is functionally very similar to any other digital signature scheme. The beauty of the BLS signature lies in aggregation. An aggregate signature is the same size as a regular signature (96 bytes). Aggregation means that multiple signatures over the same message – potentially thousands of signatures – can be checked with a single verification operation. This helps scale PoS blockchains and makes the consensus protocol viable.\n\nHow does it work? Since public keys and signatures are elliptic curve points, we can use the bilinearity property of the pairing function to form linear combinations of public keys and signatures over the same message. The verification still works the same.\n\n### Aggregating Signatures\n\nWe’ll discuss how signatures over the same message are aggregated. We add up the signatures. The addition of points on the elliptic curve is the group operation for the *G₂*  group, and each signature is a point in this group, thus the result is also a point in the group.\n\nMathematically, an aggregated signature cannot be distinguished from a non-aggregated signature. They have the same 96-byte size.\n\n### Aggregating Public Keys\n\nWe need an aggregate public key to verify an aggregate signature. This is easy to construct, provided we know which validators had signed the original message. Again, we just need to add up the public keys of the signers. The addition is the group operation of the *G₁* elliptic curve group, and the result will also be a member of the *G₁* group. Hence, an aggregated public key is mathematically indistinguishable from a non-aggregated public key and has the same size of 48 bytes.\n\n### Verifying Aggregate Signatures\n\nSince an aggregate signature is indistinguishable from a regular signature, and an aggregate public key is indistinguishable from a regular public key, we can simply follow our normal verification procedure. This is because of the bilinearity property of the pairing operation.\n\nIf we have an aggregate signature *σ* and a corresponding aggregate public key *pk*, and common message *m,* we get the following identity\n\n*e(pk , H(m)) = e(pk₁ + pk₂ + … + pkₙ , H(m))*\n\n*= e(\\[sk₁ + sk₂ + … + skₙ\\] g₁ , H(m))*\n\n*= e(g₁ , H(m)) (sk₁ + sk₂ + … + skₙ)*\n\n*=  e( g₁ , \\[sk₁ + sk₂ + … + skₙ\\] H(m))*\n\n*= e(g₁ , σ₁ + σ₂ + … + σₙ )*\n\n*= e(g₁ , σ)*\n\n\n---\n\n## Aggregation Advantages\n\nVerifying a BLS signature is a lot more computationally intensive than verifying an ECDSA signature. It is also considerably slower because of the pairing operation. So what advantage do we get by using BLS?\n\nIn situations where we can aggregate a large number of signatures, such as Beacon Chain attestation committees, BLS is advantageous. Ideally, all of a committee’s validators sign the same attestation data, hence allowing all of their signatures to be aggregated.\n\nIn practice, there might be two or three different attestations resulting from differences of opinion about the chain state between the committee members. In such a scenario, the aggregates will still be a lot lesser than the total number of members in a committee.\n\nAggregating the public keys and signatures is a lot cheaper than verification. This is because elliptic curve point additions are much, much cheaper than a pairing. Hence, using aggregation results in speed benefits.\n\nWe can verify a single signature with 2 pairings. Hence, we can naively verify *N* signatures with *2N* pairings. Or we could verify *N* signatures by aggregating them, using: 2 pairings, (*N* - 1) additions in *G₁*, and (*N* - 1) additions in *G₂* .\n\nThere are also space benefits. An aggregate signature has the same 96-byte length as a regular BLS signature. So, an aggregate of *N* signatures only occupies 1/*N* the space of the unaggregated signatures.\n\n\n---\n\n*We now know about what digital signature algorithm will be used in the Consensus Layer. But, is it a good enough solution for the long term?*\n\n*Stay tuned for the third part of this series for the answer, coming soon.*\n\n*You can find me on Twitter here: [@gryptooo](https://twitter.com/gryptooo)*\n\n*If you want to support what I do, you can send me some ETH to the address **0x6afeB3d9E380787e7D0a17Fc3CA764Bb885014FA** .

{"id": "RnpyWYzVRI8g1GKO85DbiEHo41SmnAFgKLK75wx9rrA", "title": "BLS Signature Aggregation: Under the Hood", "body": "*This is the second part of a series of articles explaining how cryptography in Ethereum works. The article assumes prior knowledge about Elliptic Curve Cryptography covered in the [previous article](https://mirror.xyz/0x6afeB3d9E380787e7D0a17Fc3CA764Bb885014FA/SJwdsUSOBEDOYDdBwIsw46Ma8FfBEy9KTeU3Cskt68g). We cover the absolute basics of BLS signatures and how their aggregation works.*\n\n\n---\n\nDigital signatures play a big role in blockchains. A message that is digitally signed guarantees two things:\n\n* **Message authenticity:** Evidence that a specific sender (owner of a private key) has created and signed the message.\n* **Message integrity:** Evidence that a message has not been tampered with after it was signed.\n\nDigital signatures aren't new and they've been there since the dawn of public key cryptography. However, recent advances in [Pairing-Based Cryptography](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/\\~ajmeneze/publications/pairings.pdf) have had a significant impact on the Consensus Layer's design.\n\nA digital signature is used every time a user sends a transaction on Ethereum. This is done at the transactional level. At the consensus level, digital signatures are not employed in the current Proof of Work Ethereum. In PoW protocols, a block only needs to have the right hash to indicate that it was mined correctly; the miner's identity is irrelevant, hence no signature is required.\n\nValidators in the PoS Ethereum system are identifiable and accountable for their actions. We require validators to make attestations and blocks to be uniquely recognizable to enforce the [Casper FFG](https://medium.com/unitychain/intro-to-casper-ffg-9ed944d98b2d) rules and count votes for the[ LMD GHOST](https://ethresear.ch/t/bitwise-lmd-ghost/4749) fork choice.\n\nSince a digital signature permanently links the sender of a message to its contents, it can be used to prove and penalize a validator who has been acting maliciously. This functionality can also be utilized outside of the protocol – for example, as an anti-spam measure, signatures are validated by nodes in the gossip layer before being forwarded.\n\nTo digitally sign user transactions, the Execution Layer (like most blockchains) uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECDSA signatures are short (65 bytes) and verified in a matter of milliseconds. The Consensus Layer is designed in such a way that it can operate on a far bigger scale than standard blockchains. It requires validators to add signatures to their blocks so that other users or validators may verify the block's authenticity. Validators also sign their other actions on the Beacon chain with their signatures.\n\nThere can be situations where hundreds of thousands of signatures might need to be verified within a single epoch. If we use ECDSA, it would take us nearly 30 minutes to verify a million signatures – this wouldn't be good enough for the Beacon chain.\n\n## ECDSA: Not Good Enough for PoS\n\nA large number of protocol messages must be handled by proof of stake protocols. Over 780 attestations gossip globally every second on the Beacon Chain, which now has almost 400,000 active validators. The figure of 780 is simply an average; there can be much higher surges. These digital signatures must be confirmed by each node in addition to traveling over the network, which is a computationally intensive operation. These signed communications must be saved in the block history as well. In most Proof of Stake networks, these conditions severely limit the number of validators.\n\nThe initial design for post-PoS Ethereum was laid out in early 2018 by [EIP-1011](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1011.md). The proposal focused on on-chain PoS management and estimated that the protocol could only handle a maximum of around 900 validators due to the high message overhead. A hefty stake size of 1500ETH per validator was set. This was problematic as it would increase centralization.\n\nJustin Drake's article titled [Pragmatic Signature Aggregation with BLS](https://ethresear.ch/t/pragmatic-signature-aggregation-with-bls/2105?u=benjaminion) came out in May 2018 and changed the course of Ethereum's move to PoS.\n\n## The Solution\n\nDrake suggested adopting [Boneh-Lynn-Shacham](https://crypto.stanford.edu/\\~dabo/pubs/papers/BLSmultisig.html), or BLS, a novel signature scheme developed by Stanford researchers. It can aggregate many digital signatures into one while keeping each validator accountable. Aggregation not only cut down on the number of individual messages that needed to be passed across the network, but it also cut down on the expense of verifying the messages' integrity.\n\nIn terms of use, the BLS signature technique is similar to ECDSA, although it is quite different mathematically. They feature two distinct characteristics that aren't found in other signature schemes:\n\n* **Any number of signatures on any number of messages can be combined into a single signature with a constant size.** Although these signatures are larger (96 bytes) than ECDSA signatures, this means we no longer need to dedicate megabytes of space in blocks solely to signatures.\n* **Any number of signatures on the same message can be verified in constant time.** It takes roughly the same time to verify a million aggregated signatures on the same message as a single signature on that message. This is advantageous in the Consensus Layer as validators often sign the same messages (say, a given block).\n\nBecause of this signature aggregation feature, we decided to drop EIP-1011 and go with the Beacon chain model we have now. It makes the Consensus layer possible and allows the Beacon Chain to scale to hundreds of thousands of validators.\n\n*Note: BLS Signatures are only a temporary solution to this problem.*\n\n***Trigger warning: Math;*** it is optional and there is no test at the end. But give it a few minutes and you’ll understand everything better.\n\n## Elliptic Curve Pairings\n\nBLS makes use of \"**pairing**,\" a special property of some elliptic curves. A pairing is a function e that outputs an element in a finite field from a pair of two points on an elliptic curve. The pairings we consider are also bilinear. This bi-linearity property has enabled the development of new cryptographic methods based on pairings.\n\nTheoretically, all elliptic curves have pairings, but there are some curves with pairings that are not suitable for cryptographic applications in practice. So how do we go about choosing curves for pairing-based cryptography?\n\nThe embedding degree *k* is a parameter associated with each elliptic curve that we can calculate. We need *k* to be a small value (certainly less than 100) to employ curves to efficiently develop pairing-based cryptography. Because nearly all elliptic curves have a very big *k*, which is usually the same as the field modulus *q*, such curves are difficult to find (at least 160 bits). There are two approaches to finding pairing-friendly elliptic curves:\n\n1. Use curves that always have *k* ≤ 6, called **supersingular elliptic curves**.\n2. Use **complex multiplication** to construct certain families of elliptic curves with small *k*.\n\nBoth of these approaches have certain [tradeoffs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730686/#b5-jres.120.002).\n\nTo construct pairing-based cryptographic protocols, we must also specify a specific pairing function *e.* The two most commonly used pairings are Weil and Tate. Researchers have come up with several innovative pairings to speed up computation as time has passed. It's vital to know that the various pairings aren't interchangeable.\n\nElliptic curve cryptography relies on the difficulty of the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) and the [Computational Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_problem#:\\~:text=The%20Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman%20problem%20(DHP,compute%2C%20but%20hard%20to%20reverse) Problem(CDHP). Both these problems have been well studied and carefully chosen parameters for the elliptic curves make the cryptographic scheme secure. Pairing based cryptography relies on another security assumption called the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem (BDHP).\n\nNote: Read Vitalik Buterin’s article about Elliptic Curve Pairings [here](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/exploring-elliptic-curve-pairings-c73c1864e627) to get a better understanding of the topic.\n\nBDHP hasn't been well studied as it's a much newer problem. If one can solve the DLP or the CDHP, then one can also solve the BDHP. As a result, pairing-based cryptography does not have stronger security than elliptic curve cryptography. At present, there are no known attacks that can break the BDHP.\n\n\n---\n\n## BLS Signatures\n\nThe Beacon chain uses Boneh-Lynn-Shacham or BLS signatures with the [BLS12-381](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/bls12-381) elliptic curve. BLS utilizes the \"[pairing](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/exploring-elliptic-curve-pairings-c73c1864e627)\" property of certain elliptic curves. Although BLS signatures are a lot slower than ECDSA signatures, they can be aggregated together and are efficient to verify at a large scale. This signature aggregation allows the Beacon Chain to scale to hundreds of thousands of network participants.\n\n### Components\n\nThere are four key components within the BLS digital signature scheme:\n\n1. **The secret or private key:** is the key used by participants to sign messages and must not be shared with anyone.\n2. **The public key:** is uniquely derived from the private key; the private key cannot be calculated using the public key. The public key represents identity in a protocol and is known to everybody.\n3. **The message:** is a string of bytes.\n4. **The signature:** is created by combining the message with the private key. A digitally signed message can be verified using the public key corresponding to the secret key used to sign the message.\n\nThe underlying math involves using 2 subgroups of the BLS12-381 elliptic curve: *G₁* is defined over a base field *Fᵩ*, and *G₂* is defined over the field extension *F*ᵩ₁₂ . The order of both the subgroups is r, which is a 77-digit prime number. The generator of *G₁* is *g₁* , and of *G₂* is *g₂* .\n\n1. The secret key *sk* is a number between 1 and *r*. Small values of *r* are impractical for cryptographic purposes.\n2. The public key *pk* is *\\[sk\\]g₁* (the square brackets represent scalar multiplication of elliptic curve group point). The public key is a member of the *G₁* group.\n3. The message *m* is a string of bytes and can be of an arbitrary length. It is hashed to a fixed-length *H(m)*, a member of the *G₂* group.\n4. The signature *σ* is a member of the *G₂* group, namely *\\[sk\\]H(m)*\n\n### Key Pairs\n\nA key pair consists of a secret key along with its corresponding public key. The secret key is randomly generated in a secure environment and the public key is uniquely determined from the private key. Key pairs are commonly stored in password-protected keystore files. [EIP-2335](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2335.md) specifies the JSON format for the storage and interchange of BLS12-381 private keys.\n\nThe secret key *sk* is a 32-byte unsigned integer. It is a common practice to drop the y-coordinate of elliptic curve points to halve the amount of data stored. The same is done for the private key *pk*, which is a point on *G₁*.  For BLS12-381, *G₁* points are reduced from 96 bytes ( 2 \\* 381 bits) to 48 bytes.\n\n### Choice of Groups\n\nThe *G₁* and *G₂* groups are interchangeable when it comes to digital signatures. We can opt to have our public keys belong to *G₁* and our signatures belong to *G₂* or vice versa.\n\nThe tradeoffs are execution speed and storage space. *G₁* has small points and is fast, *G₂* has large points and is slow. BLS12-381 was developed to implement Zcash, and they picked *G₁* to represent signatures and *G₂* to represent public keys for performance reasons.\n\nIn the consensus layer, we use *G₁* for public keys since the aggregation of signatures happens a lot more than the aggregation of public keys. Another reason for doing so is public keys of validators need to be stored in state, so keeping the representation small is important. Signatures are *G₂* points.\n\n### Signing\n\nOnly [hash tree roots](https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/building_blocks/merkleization) of objects, or their so-called signature roots, which are 32-byte strings, are signed in the beacon chain protocol. We then need to map the signing root onto an elliptic curve point in the *G₂* group. For a message with a signing root *m*, the point is *H(m)*. Here, *H* is a function that maps bytes to *G₂*.\n\nOnce we have *H(m)*, the signing process is rather straightforward. The signature *σ* will be the scalar multiplication of *H(m)* by the secret key.\n\n*σ = \\[sk\\]H(m)*\n\nThe signature *σ* is also a member of the *G₂* group. It is 96 bytes long in its compressed form.\n\n### Verifying\n\nThe public key of the validator who signed a message is required. Every validator's public key is stored in the Beacon state and can be retrieved easily using the validator's index, which is always available.\n\nWe require the message, the public key, and the signature of the validator who signed the message to validate a signature. The verification method yields a boolean value indicating whether the signature is legitimate or not.\n\nIn the BLS12-381 curve, a pairing simply takes points *P* and *Q*, where *P*∈ *G₁* and *Q* ∈ *G₂ ,* and outputs a point from a group *Gₜ*  ⊂ *F*ᵩ₁₂ . Hence, for a pairing *e*,  *e*: *G₁* × *G₂ → Gₜ*.\n\nPairings are usually denoted like *e*(*P*, *Q*) and have special properties. If we have two points *P* and *S* in *G₁ ,* and *Q* and *R* in *G₂* ,\n\n* *e(P, Q+R) =  e(P,Q) ⋅  e(P, R)*, and\n* *e(P+S, R) =  e(P, R) ⋅  e(S, R)*\n\nBy convention, *G₁*  and *G₂* are written as additive groups and *Gₜ* as multiplicative. The ⋅ operator is point multiplication in *Gₜ.*\n\nUsing this, we can deduce that all of these identities hold\n\n*e*(\\[*a*\\]*P*, \\[*b*\\]*Q* ) = *e*(*P*, \\[*b*\\]*Q* ) a  = *e*(*P*, *Q*) *ab* = *e*(*P*, \\[*a*\\]*Q*) *b* = *e*(\\[*b*\\]*P*, \\[*a*\\]*Q*)\n\nUtilizing pairings, we can easily verify a signature. The signature is valid if and only if *e*(*g*1 , *σ* ) = *e*(*pk*, *H*(*m*))\n\nHence, given the message *m*, the public key *pk*, the signature *σ*, and the fixed generator *g₁* of the *G₁* group, we can verify that the message was signed by the secret key *sk*.\n\nWe’re only making use of the identity from the properties of pairings we’d seen above.\n\n*e*(*pk*,*H*(*m*)) = *e*(\\[*sk*\\]*g*1, *H*(*m*)) = *e*(*g₁* , *H*(*m*))(*sk*)  = *e*(*g₁*, \\[*sk*\\]*H*(*m*)) = *e*(*g₁*,*σ*)\n\nThe verification returns True if and only if the signature corresponds both to the public key of the signing validator (i.e. the signature and the public key were both generated from the same secret key) and to the message (i.e. the message is identical to the original signed message). Otherwise, it returns False.\n\n### Aggregation\n\nSo far, what we’ve covered about BLS is functionally very similar to any other digital signature scheme. The beauty of the BLS signature lies in aggregation. An aggregate signature is the same size as a regular signature (96 bytes). Aggregation means that multiple signatures over the same message – potentially thousands of signatures – can be checked with a single verification operation. This helps scale PoS blockchains and makes the consensus protocol viable.\n\nHow does it work? Since public keys and signatures are elliptic curve points, we can use the bilinearity property of the pairing function to form linear combinations of public keys and signatures over the same message. The verification still works the same.\n\n### Aggregating Signatures\n\nWe’ll discuss how signatures over the same message are aggregated. We add up the signatures. The addition of points on the elliptic curve is the group operation for the *G₂*  group, and each signature is a point in this group, thus the result is also a point in the group.\n\nMathematically, an aggregated signature cannot be distinguished from a non-aggregated signature. They have the same 96-byte size.\n\n### Aggregating Public Keys\n\nWe need an aggregate public key to verify an aggregate signature. This is easy to construct, provided we know which validators had signed the original message. Again, we just need to add up the public keys of the signers. The addition is the group operation of the *G₁* elliptic curve group, and the result will also be a member of the *G₁* group. Hence, an aggregated public key is mathematically indistinguishable from a non-aggregated public key and has the same size of 48 bytes.\n\n### Verifying Aggregate Signatures\n\nSince an aggregate signature is indistinguishable from a regular signature, and an aggregate public key is indistinguishable from a regular public key, we can simply follow our normal verification procedure. This is because of the bilinearity property of the pairing operation.\n\nIf we have an aggregate signature *σ* and a corresponding aggregate public key *pk*, and common message *m,* we get the following identity\n\n*e(pk , H(m)) = e(pk₁ + pk₂ + … + pkₙ , H(m))*\n\n*= e(\\[sk₁ + sk₂ + … + skₙ\\] g₁ , H(m))*\n\n*= e(g₁ , H(m)) (sk₁ + sk₂ + … + skₙ)*\n\n*=  e( g₁ , \\[sk₁ + sk₂ + … + skₙ\\] H(m))*\n\n*= e(g₁ , σ₁ + σ₂ + … + σₙ )*\n\n*= e(g₁ , σ)*\n\n\n---\n\n## Aggregation Advantages\n\nVerifying a BLS signature is a lot more computationally intensive than verifying an ECDSA signature. It is also considerably slower because of the pairing operation. So what advantage do we get by using BLS?\n\nIn situations where we can aggregate a large number of signatures, such as Beacon Chain attestation committees, BLS is advantageous. Ideally, all of a committee’s validators sign the same attestation data, hence allowing all of their signatures to be aggregated.\n\nIn practice, there might be two or three different attestations resulting from differences of opinion about the chain state between the committee members. In such a scenario, the aggregates will still be a lot lesser than the total number of members in a committee.\n\nAggregating the public keys and signatures is a lot cheaper than verification. This is because elliptic curve point additions are much, much cheaper than a pairing. Hence, using aggregation results in speed benefits.\n\nWe can verify a single signature with 2 pairings. Hence, we can naively verify *N* signatures with *2N* pairings. Or we could verify *N* signatures by aggregating them, using: 2 pairings, (*N* - 1) additions in *G₁*, and (*N* - 1) additions in *G₂* .\n\nThere are also space benefits. An aggregate signature has the same 96-byte length as a regular BLS signature. So, an aggregate of *N* signatures only occupies 1/*N* the space of the unaggregated signatures.\n\n\n---\n\n*We now know about what digital signature algorithm will be used in the Consensus Layer. But, is it a good enough solution for the long term?*\n\n*Stay tuned for the third part of this series for the answer, coming soon.*\n\n*You can find me on Twitter here: [@gryptooo](https://twitter.com/gryptooo)*\n\n*If you want to support what I do, you can send me some ETH to the address **0x6afeB3d9E380787e7D0a17Fc3CA764Bb885014FA** .

{"id": "CWWHzMk03accmucgUnlvZ71Q1pX96ErtwErjoEbAcFY", "title": "Success is doing the right thing at the right time", "body": "Who is not eager for success? How to succeed, especially how to achieve rapid success, has become a problem that many people cannot put down in their hearts. Therefore, in order to find a shortcut, people often imitate successful people and expect to clone the same success. But success never knocks on their door. They were puzzled: why?\nIn fact, many times, people don't lack diligence and persistence, but why don't they succeed? At this time, you need to calm down and think about what you can do and what you are suitable for. Don't always stare at the success of others. The light will be dazzling and make you confused in direction, so that you just want to be others, not yourself. In a word, sometimes, success is not as simple as dripping water wears stone. It's not enough to dance at the sound of a chicken. You have to know yourself well.\nTherefore, smart people will not copy the success of others, but fully understand themselves and do what they should do at the right time.\nThere is a fable that is very interesting: an eagle swoops down to catch a sheep, catching one accurately. The crow was very envious, so he dived like an eagle to catch the sheep. As a result, his claws were caught by the wool, struggling and easily caught by the shepherd. The shepherd's son asked the shepherd, \"Why are crows so easy to catch?\" The Shepherd said, \"because he forgot what bird it is!\"\nWe can't completely deny this crow's behavior. Soldiers who don't want to be generals are not good soldiers. Crows are eager for success and have the ideal of catching sheep, which is not wrong. But the end of the crow is very sad, and the reason is thought-provoking: if the crow knew that he was just a crow, no matter how much practice it could not practice the ability to dive in the air and catch sheep, it would not do that. It can be seen that only by knowing your qualifications, strengths and weaknesses, developing strengths and avoiding weaknesses, and working hard in fields suitable for you, can you have a chance of success.\nThere are many negative examples, such as learning to walk in Handan and imitating others. They all tell the same story.\nTake a look at the story of Li Ning, the prince of Gymnastics:\nLi Ning plans to retire after achieving three gold, two silver and one copper achievements in the Los Angeles Olympic Games. At this time, Li Ning was 25 years old and full of injuries. It was time to quit the sports world, both in terms of age and physical condition. In the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, the national team let Li Ning take the lead in the case of being out of time. Li Ning, who knew it was not suitable but did not want to bear the reputation of ingratitude, took part in it, and was defeated in Seoul. This failure made him deeply realize that he is not suitable to be a gymnast anyway. If he retires, he may create new brilliance in his life. When he got off the plane back home, he walked alone on the passage dozens of meters away without flowers and applause. This is a gray passage called \"the way of the world\" by Li Ning. Well, this gray way made him learn to think, re understand himself, and better understand what time is suitable for doing, what is not suitable for doing, and how to be the master of time and success.\nLater, as we all know, Li Ning created the famous Li Ning brand sportswear and promoted the development of China's sports industry. He not only created sports miracles, but also created brilliant business.\nOnly by doing the right thing at the right time can we know ourselves, manage ourselves and live a wonderful life.", "timestamp": 1657374466, "digest": "7hzACb13-N6iMPthQhCoUVnk9M-y7RB-XwJBe7zQNH0", "contributor": "0xA70184cAb4b9a0aee0951ea3Bb542A6E48971885"}

Lose face\n    Sometimes we bow our heads in order to see the way we go. Many people think that we have passed fairly well and are unwilling to try new things. Many things can't be put down, and we can't pull this face down, and finally die in face.\n 2. Put down the pressure\n    Whether you are tired or not depends on your mentality. The room of the soul will be covered with dust if it is not cleaned. Sweeping the floor and removing dust can brighten the gloomy heart; Clear things up, R can say goodbye to upset; Throw away some unnecessary pain, and there will be more and more room for happiness.\n 3. Put down the past, you can live a happier life!\n    Try to change your mentality and adjust your mood. Learn to calmly accept the reality, learn to say let it be, learn to face adversity calmly, learn to look at life positively, and learn to think for the best in everything.\n 4. Put down inferiority complex\n    Delete inferiority from your dictionary. Not everyone can become a great man, but everyone can become a strong person inside. Believe in yourself and find your position, you can also have a valuable life.\n 5. Put down laziness - struggle to change fate\n    The unique skill is to make an ordinary little thing perfect, which is a unique skill. Remind yourself and remember your reminder. You who are motivated, happy, healthy and kind will have a brilliant life.\n 6. Let go of negativity - despair to the left, hope to the right\n    If you want to be a successful person, please cheer for \"the best yourself\". Let positivity beat negativity, nobility beat vulgarity, sincerity beat hypocrisy, tolerance beat intolerance, happiness Beat Depression, diligence beat laziness, strength beat vulnerability, greatness beat wretchedness... As long as you like, you can be the best yourself all your life.\n    No one can control the outcome, except you. In your own war, you are the general who plans strategies!\n 7. Let go of complaining - it's better to work hard than complaining\n    All failures are preparation for success. Complaining and discouragement can only hinder the pace of success. It is undoubtedly a wise man's gesture to put aside complaints and accept failure calmly. Complaining can't change the status quo, and hard work can bring hope. Real gold, as long as you don't bury yourself, as long as you focus on flashing, there will always be a shining day. Don't always worry about life. Don't always think that life has failed you. In fact, you have as much as others.\n 8. Let go of hesitation - take immediate action and achieve unlimited success\n    Don't be indecisive about what you have identified; Choose a right direction, just go on the road, don't look back.\n    Immediate action is a common trait of all successful people. If you have any good ideas, act immediately; If you encounter a good opportunity, seize it immediately. Take action now and your success will be unlimited!\n 9. Let go of parochialism - if you have a wide heart, the world will be wide.\n    Tolerance is a virtue. Being tolerant of others is actually making way for your own soul. Only in a tolerant world can people play a harmonious song of life!\n10. Put aside your doubts one by one. It's difficult to do things with doubts. You don't need to doubt people.\n    Don't identify the thoughts of others with your doubts. Don't suspect others, otherwise it will only affect the friendship between each other.", "timestamp": 1657374541, "digest": "W6kcRGPYXfcX9v5bLRGs1Lz3PdjyPnut_zTxo-X3blw", "contributor": "0xBeE961f762506779c6aAcaE2CB6D9E431AFbDaB2"}
{"id": "hUpXQXxwlt8xVVIXQihTGj8sFVcj3DMOTkxgONnWH_0", "title": "What do you want? Earn it yourself", "body": "Recently, I was besieged by some post-80s and post-90s generation on Weibo because I called on China to develop high-density cities, small family houses and use public transportation. Everyone unanimously asked, \"Professor, why do you want us to live in a small room when you live in a big room in the United States?\"\nI couldn't help but answer back: \"say what you want wherever you go. China is short of land resources. China is not Canada. Most people want to live in small houses in China. If you don't like it, go to Canada.\"\nIn fact, what's worse, I haven't said: \"why can I live in a big room, but you can only live in a small room? Because I'm a professor in the United States. You're young and haven't done anything. Why is it your turn to live in a big room?\"\nSome netizens probably heard the voice outside my words and left a message saying, \"you may be brilliant, but not everyone has your ability, but shouldn't they live with dignity?\"\nI had to tell him: I am not brilliant at home or abroad, at least in terms of material. Pursuing material is not my purpose of life. However, China has so little land resources and so many people. If people with average ability have to live in big houses to have dignity, where can we find so much land?\nOur husband and wife, from China to the United States, all the way to famous schools, from Peking University, Fudan University to Yale. This is not only the luck that most people don't have, but also the result of their own struggle. In the eyes of many people, this is also quite \"successful\". But I didn't own a house or live in a big house before I was 48 years old. In fact, before I was 43 years old (that is, before my daughter was 5 years old), I belonged to the humble family. The last few years of study. A family of three huddled in a small attic in New York. The heat of summer melted the candles in the closet. Now it's like yesterday. We also don't feel that we have no dignity. I don't understand that we didn't feel wronged living in the United States when we were 40. Why can't young people today stand it?\nI remember the most comfortable period of life when I was a doctor was when my husband and wife studied in Japan with their newborn daughter, which was between 1999 and 2000. Like many Chinese students studying in Japan, we learned that the Japanese were so crowded when we arrived in Japan. We lived in an apartment of about 50 square meters at that time. Japanese guests were very surprised when they came: \"how can you live in such a big house?\" The building we live in is the dormitory for advanced students of the \"Japan Research Center\" jointly run by American universities. One of the reasons for the large house is that the location is very poor, just next to the homeless relief center. Even at one o'clock one night, a drunken homeless man knocked on my door. When you visit ordinary Japanese families, you can see that their homes are often much more crowded than many middle-class families in China. Today, Japan's per capita GDP is more than $45000, while China's is less than $5500.\nLook at Boston, one of the most advanced high-tech cities in the United States. The annual income of medium-sized households (including singles) is more than 55000 dollars, and the population is only 600000. The density is much smaller than that of big cities in China, and there are much more land resources. However, recently, Boston is building 30 square meters of small apartments. This is also for the young professional class. Its purpose is to control the rent at $1200-1600 per month, so that young people can have a foothold. Designers said that these fledgling professional classes, with limited economic capacity, when they are energetic, start businesses and socialize outside all day long, and go home just to sleep. What they need is not expensive big houses, but to reduce the cost of struggle. In fact, young people especially welcome this arrangement. If a young man who has just graduated from Ivy League said to my professor who is over 50 years old, \"why do you live in more than 250 square meters, and we live in 30 square meters? Where is my dignity?\" In American society. I'm afraid you'll think such a person is a little crazy.\nNo matter how rich a society is, strive from the bottom. Fighting from the starting point of having nothing is still \"kingcraft\" Lost this spirit. Society loses the impetus for progress. This reminds me of the words of an American columnist: \"all middle-aged successful people, if possible, are willing to exchange all their achievements and money for the poor and humble life back then.\" Youth is the happiness and beauty of life. If you lose the ability to feel this kind of thing, you lose your life.\nOf course, I don't want to overthrow a generation with the concept of post-80s and post-90s generation. In fact, there are many younger generations who support me on Weibo. It is precisely they who tell me that there are indeed too many people in their peers who think that everything should be given to them by their parents. In my opinion, domestic elders should boldly admonish younger students: child, it's not your turn. What do you want?

For me, it is extremely impossible, even sad, for you to use a concept to describe the ability of an entire generation.\nThis may be the mother of all changes. At least maybe. It's not that I'm going to say all my previous logic on this topic. Far from that, I recently found a crack in the armor of my previous argument. Yes, it's a small crack, but you know what happens to a small crack. They will only get bigger and bigger.\nThis is the case. I'm getting old. You don't know how much I hate to admit this, but it's true. And there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that if I am still employed as a senior executive in the high-tech industry, I will be too busy accumulating frequent flyer mileage and arranging other things at the same time in the meeting to realize that things are happening.\nTherefore, my decision to retire early from the corporate world - which still annoys my wife endlessly - is a warning for the baby boomers and Generation X, who are different from me. Maybe they are too focused on reaching the next level in the corporate level or on squeezing out another 2% of the market share, and cannot realize that their bodies are not the only thing aging.\nyou 're right. When I sat in Pete's coffee shop waiting for the dent on my aging Mercedes Benz sports car to be repaired, at that moment, I realized more strongly that just as my joints became stiff and my tendons were losing elasticity, the same thing also happened to the neural pathways in my brain.\nLike it or not, I'm more comfortable. I'm used to my way. Of course, I am willing to change, but let's face the reality - with all these experiences, I have a very good reason to disillusion my dream, right? The older I get, the wiser I become, and the greater the obstacles to change. This is the truth.\nNow, if you don't think I'm a little funny and overemphasize things, then you must be new here. But there is absolutely a factor of truth in all these. I'm trying to make a very important point.\nYou know, for many years I have been observing executives and managers who would be successful if inertia or the status quo did not damage their previously effective organization. I always want to know what deprives them of their entrepreneurial spirit, makes them complacent, and puts their companies in danger of losing flexibility, flexibility and intelligence like themselves.\nNow I know. This is the inevitable price of time, age and experience. The fact is that we are all fighting against nature. Any good psychologist, neurologist, or anyone who studies such things will tell you that your brain does lose plasticity over time. Neural pathways do become more fixed. We will indeed become more complacent. Learning new things will indeed become more difficult.\nHowever, this is not all doomed. Not at all. Nothing is doomed. Each of us has to struggle to get rid of this fate in the depths of our hearts, quote Dylan? Dylanthomas said, \"don't go into that beautiful night meekly.\" But being honest with yourself, knowing what you're fighting and following these four simple and effective ways can help you stop your brain from aging, help keep your mind young and make you competitive:\nNever stop facing your fears. We all think that I should not have continued to do this, should not have continued to fight and should not have always challenged myself. Indeed, you shouldn't. But once you stop challenging yourself and stop facing your fears, you will grow old faster. The reason is simple: fear prevents you from trying new things and ideas. That's it.\nOften look in the mirror for a long time. No, I'm not talking about looking at the lines on your face in the mirror. I'm talking about looking at the lines engraved in your brain in the mirror. If you know yourself, see why you are like this and think about what you want to be, then you won't wake up one day and realize that youth has come and gone, but you somehow let this happen.\nStay hungry. It's easy to be satisfied with your position or current situation. This is especially true for successful people. Once this happens, you will lose your advantages, your motivation and your reason for existence. You really need to prove that you motivated you when you were young. This is a powerful driving force.\nChallenge the status quo, especially your own. The biggest problem with experience and success is that you start to think that you know everything and you have all the answers. This is not how the business world works. Past performance does not represent future results. Just because something worked once or even twice in the past doesn't mean it will work again.\nThe problem of aging is largely the same as in the business world. They are completely similar. The world is changing, technology is changing, competition is changing, markets are changing, leaders are changing, and you must also make changes. Yes, when it comes to aging, inertia is the enemy, just as in business. Maintain a good fighting state. Keep flexible and elastic, which will keep you young and competitive.", "timestamp": 1657374780, "digest": "Pkhvb1W9kvaKaUhQRAPuZ1qtOM5HXHFiHE3IOi7RPas", "contributor": "0x7BB57447312fe2A1f5c9A299C1627DB252af00D8"}

The specific source is in a pamphlet called New Oriental spirit, which is an inspirational book given by New Oriental to every student in the early years. I spent 3 yuan to buy this little book from the school stall and read it bored. At that time, I consciously failed in the college entrance examination and came to that remote and cold town. Various constructions were built on the campus. Most of my classmates were local students with local accent. As one of the few students from other provinces, my college entrance examination score is more than 100 points higher than the admission score of local students. Under such a drop, like many students who think they are good B, I think I am the legendary angel with broken wings. Instead of falling into the West Lake, I fell into a pit that is still under construction. At that time, I didn't love that place at all. Hostility and resistance made me cut school endlessly, and I felt that my talent was never in this small place. I felt like gold all the time, just buried in the pit.\nI can't say that my university is immovable, but as an ordinary two books school, I can say that my school is moving slowly. After major changes and upgrades, my school enrolls 6000 people a year, and the headmaster of nearly 50 years old leads me to see a scene of large-scale construction, but he is very ambitious. At the beginning of our school year, he flew to Harvard, Yale and other world-famous schools to visit and study, and practiced in the school, making bold innovations. For example, the male and female dormitories are in the same building, and the boys are on the first floor, and the girls are on the first floor. Although this kind of accommodation method announced the failure of the experiment a year later and re divided the building, it made me like this kind of courage and courage, and let me see a little fresh and brave light in this small city.\nAt that time, like many students who wrote to me that they had entered an unsatisfactory school, I was all kinds of despised, all kinds of depressed, all kinds of unwilling, and all kinds of unwanted. I always feel that I am a narcissus, just put it in the pile of onions, and wait for myself to open up one day. So endless sadness and dissatisfaction poured in. There were red posters posted on the bulletin board of the campus every day about me not going to self-study, not going out of morning exercises, not handing in my homework, being absent from class and late. My open-minded heart was forced to practice extremely pure feelings during that time! At that time, I felt very frustrated when I saw the poster without my name.\nDuring that time, I went to the library every day to read \"college students\" magazine, holding a glass of water, reading magazines in a warm room, turning them one by one. I see that many college students in Beijing can go to Siemens, P & G, Shenma's internship, or go abroad to exchange Shenma's. look at the other people's world, look at their own small city, which is not even the capital of the province. It's freezing every day, and they have to bring a bottle of water to pour into the vegetable basin to prevent salty death, in the sky and underground.\nI complain about this small city every day. I just don't like it for no reason, but what if I don't like it?\n\"If the environment doesn't move, I'll go by myself!\" Until I saw this sentence.\nYeah, why don't I go by myself? Why should I wait for the school to arrange everything for me? Since I think I'm extremely talented and wronged myself here, why don't I run quickly and go where I should be? Don't I think I'm great? Don't I think I just made a mistake in the college entrance examination? In this case, then run, run to a very front place! Why are you chirping here?\nThis sentence woke me up, so I took the initiative to find a foreign teacher in the foreign language department. I got up at 5 o'clock every morning to learn English with him, and I was sleepy every day; I took the initiative to apply for the TOEFL, GRE, GMAT, IELTS and other international English tests that students in key universities have confidence in, forcing myself to listen to three repeaters and nearly 100 tapes; I took the initiative to apply for an intern at Coca Cola, starting with a supermarket promoter of 30 yuan a day, and I was always bullied; I took the initiative to apply to be an exchange student at Peking University. After two years, I had no sense of belonging and was often discriminated against.\nAfter these messy days of crazy running everywhere, I don't know where I went, who I got rid of, and how far I got rid of. But I learned a truth:\nWhen we fall into an environment that we don't like or look down on psychologically, we always feel that we are better than everyone around us. In fact, everyone is complaining. Everyone feels in their heart that they are a hard force and that they are all angels with broken wings. So a group of people complain there every day, and finally a group of fools can't see anyone.\nIf you want to jump out of this forced group, the only way is to take action. No matter what your environment is, you must take action! If your environment doesn't move, please go by yourself!\nThe hardest thing in life!\nIt's not that you fell into a motionless environment!\nBut after n years!\nThe environment has changed!\nYou TMD haven't left yet!\nNow, I'm still living a ridiculous life. I always put myself in the second \"day\" of heaven, so I turn myself into a drudge again and again, but I can't complain, so I run hard, and it's too late to see the surrounding environment. I am ah q, constantly comforting myself, oh, it's not that the environment is bad, it's not that others are wrong, it's that I didn't fight for it, it's that I didn't run\nThis sentence fell into my heart, not to force me to run, but to remind myself:\nIf not satisfied!\nPlease get out at once!\nNow, now!\nGo where you want to go!\nI would like to dedicate this article to the brave headmaster I never met, and the school that was not a bird at that time, but now I miss it very much!", "timestamp": 1657374701, "digest": "CSpRcO-6OL5HWzm1BZa8W5mgcgJW3E_cBN6vi5qQI4w", "contributor": "0xe7CA4cdDDf219e2Ba3095c79C9Fe380EA73353e0"}

{"id": "6excC61utAGeCW4uyvHX9ldctyqGR-73-mMU1dCpUfk", "title": "Some suggestions for effective use of time", "body": "Among my friends, I am considered to be an efficient time user, because I climb mountains, take photos, brush watercress, read books, study, take exams for various certificates, have various parties, and have a job that is not idle. Some people are always curious to ask: How did you accomplish so many things at the same time? Don't you sleep? Or are you working at all?\nMy answer is that time is the water in the sponge and the cleavage of the breast. To be able to do more things is not necessarily to have more free time than others, but to use time more efficiently than others. Personal advice on usage time:\n\n 1. High concentration. There is no way to talk about efficiency without the ability to focus on anything. Therefore, we should cultivate the ability to quickly focus on one thing and have strong anti-interference ability.\n 2. Be good at using fragmented time. People have a lot of fragmented time in a day, especially for office workers, such as waiting for cars, trains, planes, UFOs, and when there are no beautiful women chatting up on the way, don't underestimate the fragmented time. A little makes a lot is very considerable, and you can use this time to read books and think about some problems.\n 3. There is deadline In addition to being imposed by the outside world, individuals should also put forward requirements for themselves, and take this deadline as a mandatory standard, which must be completed on time. It is important to win trust from others and yourself, which can make you respect your plans and arrangements.\n 4. Have a time plan every day. The priorities of things should be arranged in order. First, the important and urgent things should be completed, then the important but not urgent things, and finally other things. In addition, don't waste time on meaningless things.\n 5. Leisure is also part of the rational use of time. Don't idle for a long time, but take leisure as a part of life.\n 6. Master good methods of doing things. If you want to do good work, you must sharpen your tools first. Good methods can improve efficiency. When doing things, we should quickly learn and sum up experience and choose the best method.\n 7. Watch less TV. TV programs can be used as entertainment, but it is not suitable as a way of learning.\n 8. Form your own work / study rhythm. Be consistent with the group in matters requiring mutual coordination and cooperation. In the personal field, we should form a study / work rhythm that conforms to our habits and abilities according to our own abilities. For students, the pace of teachers' lectures is not fast, which can form a model of self-study + difficult to find teachers.\n 9. It's important to work hard. Many things are often high momentum and determination at the beginning, but later they become more and more delayed. Rather than this, it's better to finish it in one go, especially for those who don't have strong willpower.\n10. Cultivate your willpower. Make a 30 day plan for yourself and accomplish something every day within this 30 day period, such as getting up on time or running 10 kilometers.\n11. Exercise regularly. Physical exercise can cultivate willpower and make your mind clear and excited at the same time, which is better than beating chicken blood.\n12. Have ideas about the future. Goals are like lighthouses. Efforts and main time in the general direction of life are in this direction. No matter what goals they have, those who have goals and work hard will live a fuller life than those who have no goals, and they will also know the value of time better.", "timestamp": 1657375104, "digest": "Y59C9H7wIpIrIeOUfmZjVBK2QHe7WMTSktaXYJA9KoE", "contributor": "0x08131E947847911ea45952A0FAf04f622a9BCB5F"}

When you were young, you might have heard a passionate life inspirational lecture. After listening to it, you couldn't sleep and decided to recite words overnight. He took out a Longman Dictionary or Merriam Webster Dictionary and began to recite it overnight. His eyes were bright and stared like copper bells. I only slept for a few hours at night, and I was very excited the next day. How long can this beautiful and progressive state last? Usually it's twoorthree days, a week longer. On the third day, as soon as you look at this dictionary, you will moan in your heart, thinking how it is you again! There is a saying called three minutes of heat, which is about this situation. In fact, many people are like this.\nIf we want to make continuous progress and maintain this beautiful and excited state, we'd better listen to a passionate life inspirational lecture every three days. But think about it, how can such conditions exist? Therefore, the second best thing to achieve a similar effect is to read some so-called inspirational books.\nFirst of all, you should understand that when you make a difficult and phased plan, having so many books beside your bed is definitely the best spiritual opium. When you can't hold on, pick it up and turn it around, it's like giving you a shot of stimulant, and you can hold on for three days. At that time, I went to the old book market in Haidian book city to buy the cheapest kind of broken books. I carefully selected them there. I went there three times, bought a pile and piled it at the door as war preparation food, and then began the hard review work.\nIt's almost what I thought. I behaved fairly well for the first time and lasted for 4 days. In the future, it will all be abandoned in three days. The reason why I insisted on four days for the first time was just that the weather was bad and it rained every day, so I closed the door to study. Anyway, I didn't want to go out when it rained. It was good to recite words at home and do exercises. In the morning of the fifth day, it cleared up, with blue sky and white clouds. My house is on the 6th floor, and the houses nearby are very low. When I look in the direction of the city, I feel the world of mortals rolling in the distance. Hearing hallucinations appeared in my ears, as if there was an evil voice saying, \"young people, come in and play, rolling mortals, what are you doing in the suburbs? Great youth, isn't it?\" I thought, yes, so I took out my mobile phone and called the friends in the city. Then they said, come out quickly and don't say anything. It was said that where to eat in the evening, and then sing and pinch your feet. It was very lively.\nAfter cleaning up and ready to go out, I walked to the door and saw that the books were covered with ash. I had bought them for five days and had not touched them once, so I thought I should give them a chance. Then casually picked up a book, turned less than 3 pages, and there was a sentence that hit me like lightning, which was what Li Ao said when he was young: be not afraid of hardship, endure hardship for half a life; Afraid of hardship, endure hardship for a lifetime. When I saw that sentence, I thought how well it was said. You think, I was a man in my twenties who achieved nothing at that time. Now I have just made a phased life plan, and I am ready to give up after less than a few days.\nAt this juncture, there was a person far away in Taiwan who said such a sentence. How could I see it by mistake? This magical feeling is a bit like hearing any love song on the road when you are lovelorn, and you feel that the lyrics are for you. At that time, I was ashamed, crying, kneeling on the ground, hitting the wall and rolling, twitching, what tears, cold sweat, all came out, and finally rushed into the bathroom for a cold shower. Then he slapped himself a dozen times, went back to the computer, calmed down, recited the words first, and then did the questions, recited the words when it was disgusting, recited the words when it was disgusting, and did the questions when it was disgusting. It was easy for another day. The next day, the third day, I hesitated, but I stopped.\nOn the fourth day, it was exactly the same, and I wanted to give up, so I thought what I was doing. My great youth was being consumed here, so I wanted to give up again. I went to the door and saw those books. I thought I should give them another chance, so I picked up another one. be careful! At this time, there is a technical problem. If you take the last one again and turn to the sentence, \"not afraid of hardship, endure hardship for half a lifetime; afraid of hardship, endure hardship for a lifetime\", does it work? It certainly doesn't work.\nMaybe you scold your mother in your heart as soon as you see it. Your heart says that I was fooled by your words, and I only suffered three more days of sin! Otherwise, I would have gone to the world of mortals! Therefore, the experience and lessons of history tell us: never touch that book again. Why did I buy a bunch? That's why. Otherwise, one copy is enough. Pick up another book, turn it casually, turn less than 3 pages, and another warning saying, there is only one kind of failure, that is, giving up halfway. I thought, wow, how well said! Then he cried loudly and rolled all over the floor. When he couldn't do it again, he rushed to the bathroom to take a cold bath. This time, it's very extreme that even the flashier clothes are cut off, leaving only some autumn clothes and trousers. You can't go out to meet people.\nIt's no exaggeration to give up once every three days on average. Once or twice in the middle, the evil friends really couldn't bear it. They killed me in the suburbs and carried me out to the world of mortals. But basically relying on that pile of books, I stuck to the end. In fact, when I left the house, there were only twoorthree books left in the pile that I hadn't touched, and I read the rest. In other words, it is crucial to master the quantity. If you are so poor, you may have wasted all your previous efforts.", "timestamp": 1657374901, "digest": "m6pQ9SYuavCl6YTbWkf3Aa28dJ_pbAMUN1SI7femFqo", "contributor": "0xAf848C4390cA56BCDC38C44c396F809bA35941A0"}
{"id": "LYv5I6EU_JCmqGWM5D6smdPR5flhHSxAEoVYUrX5MWw", "title": "Success is just \"try again\"", "body": "There is an interesting experiment: dace is the natural enemy of minnows. Biologists put dace and minnows into the same glassware, and then separated them with glass plates. At the beginning, the dace attacked the minnows excitedly, eager to eat their favorite delicious food, but every time it \"bang\" against the glass plate, not only did it not catch the minnows, but also knocked itself dizzy. After touching the wall dozens of times, the dace was depressed. When biologists quietly removed the glass plate, the dace turned a blind eye to the minnows that were close at hand. Even if the fat minnow wiped its labial gills again and again and swam leisurely, even if the tail of the minnow swept its hungry and agile body again and again, the dace behind the wall no longer had the desire and confidence to attack. A few days later, the minnows were still swimming freely because of the feed provided by biologists, while the minnows had turned up their snow-white bellies and floated on the water.\nDace gave up its efforts just because it ran into a wall several times. Even though the delicious food was available later, it gave up trying, and finally died of hunger. Dace is sad and ridiculous, but have we ever been that \"dace\" in life? A little wind and waves made us abandon the ship and go ashore, a small bump against the wall made us stagnate, and a small blow made us give up all our dreams and efforts... Many times, the real reason for our failure is that we didn't \"try again\" in the face of the \"minnows\" whose \"glass plates\" had been removed in front of us\nThis reminds me of another story. A man was trapped on a cliff, leaving only a little food and a hook rope in his backpack. The man thought to himself, \"now you must hook the rope in the stone crack, and then climb up, so as to get out of trouble.\" So he threw the rope up, but it was not hooked. He tried again, but failed. He continued to try many times, but still did not hook the stone. It was getting dark, and he thought, \"try again, maybe you can succeed.\" But it still failed. At this time, he was exhausted and hungry. He picked up the little food left and wolfed it down. After eating, he fell asleep tired. When he woke up the next day, he summoned up the courage to continue throwing, but he failed as he did yesterday. He sat on the ground, depressed, and even thought about giving up, but he struggled with a voice in his heart: \"try again, try again.\" It is this sentence that makes him stand up and keep trying. Sure enough, \"the emperor is worthy of his heart\". This time, the rope caught the stone. He pulled hard to make sure it was tight enough, and climbed up along the rope. Finally, he escaped the fate of death.\nThere are often such laws in life: the difficulty of mountaineering lies not in the first few kilometers under your feet, but in the tens of meters or even a few meters before you reach the top; The person who walks out of the desert of death is not necessarily the fastest runner, but the one who firmly believes that he can walk out alive and unswervingly in one direction. Therefore, the road of life cannot be plain sailing, setbacks and difficulties are inevitable, but the key is whether you can continue to adhere to it and try again when you fail to succeed after many efforts? In fact, try again, success will shake hands with you and enjoy the beauty of life.", "timestamp": 1657374971, "digest": "PlCrxrSFVVS58bvkYX7HKUysbYsjojd1pO5Ybbz4wbo", "contributor": "0x9B89764F315dA31A74103f61889BCc485B51c85E"}

{"id": "r7pDG3yrKMzY27TjySEGkbFV1V5COU7j8Fmg-_ObeIA", "title": "The beauty of pain", "body": "People are born to pursue happiness, but they must live with pain. People can't avoid pain. People need pain to grow up.\nWhy can't people avoid pain?\nWe have always had a deep misunderstanding that those with high status and good economic conditions have no pain. Actually, it's not. First, because they also have desires. Desire is endless, and if it cannot be realized, it will be painful. No matter how good the condition is, there is also the problem of insufficient comparison, and no matter how high the status is, there will also be a \"sense of intermediation\" People are envious of each level, so those with high status are not satisfied. The material below the food and clothing line determines happiness, and the spirit above the food and clothing line determines happiness. The poor and the rich suffer, but for different reasons. In fact, when people's conditions are good enough to do whatever they want, there are also great disadvantages. The phenomenon of \"the emperor does not live long\" vividly explains this point. Because without external constraints, people will be defeated by their own weaknesses. Second, because pain is diverse. Some sufferings, such as diseases, natural and man-made disasters, emotional injuries and so on, will be encountered by both the poor and the rich.\nWhy does human growth need pain?\nPain can help people overcome their shortcomings. Everyone has many inherent stubborn shortcomings and defects, such as selfishness, laziness, arrogance, vanity, lust and so on. Under normal circumstances, people cannot overcome themselves. Only in the face of difficulties and challenges, because of the great external pressure, can people overcome their shortcomings and gradually mature. Therefore, the ancients said, \"difficulties and hardships make you successful.\" For a simple example, we can't control our mouth, but gout can help us control it. After gout controls our mouth, we can't suffer from fatal diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, there is a saying that \"minor illness nourishes people\", and minor illness is the \"fuse\" of serious illness\nPain helps people think. \"Gain wisdom after a fall\", \"failure is the mother of success\", \"fall and pick up a clear\" and so on. They all say that people learn a lesson after suffering a loss, have experience, understand the truth, and become smart. Therefore, pain is a teacher. It makes us think, understand things, understand social rules, and understand human nature. Let's gradually learn how to speak, how to do things, where people are, and so on. In this way, people gradually mature in repeated practice. Therefore, the ancients said that \"heaven will impose great responsibilities on people, so they must first work hard, strain their muscles and bones, and starve their bodies and skin.\"\nPain tests one's will. Life will encounter all kinds of pain. Such as poverty, toil, humiliation, illness, frustration and so on. People get what they stand for. Pain will make us learn to endure and adapt in a forced way, so as to enhance our resilience and ability to resist setbacks and blows, so as to have a strong will and perseverance, which is the root of human beings. A tough man with responsibility must be tempered in social storms and life's pain and suffering. People who live in prosperity are greenhouse flowers, which will be eliminated after a storm.\nPain is the source of motivation for people to work hard. People are very servile. Without external pressure, people in a carefree and abundant living environment are usually difficult to consciously struggle. Only through the stimulation of pain can people aspire to change their fate to stay away from pain. All ideals and aspirations are conceived in the soil of pain, \"born of hardship, die of happiness\" means this. \"Since ancient times, great talents have suffered more than great men.\" pain is indispensable to people. A life without pain is incomplete, and pain is a required course in life. Because of this, the concept of \"Frustration Education\" came into being.\nIn one's life, everyone has pain, and objectively, people also need painful adjustment. Pain is valuable, and pain is a resource. As long as our cognition is correct and our physical and mental endurance allows, pain will help us succeed and be happy. But there is a difference between suffering sooner or later. I think I have suffered earlier and benefited earlier. Because I have suffered earlier, I have made up my mind early and changed my fate as soon as possible. Because of the limited life, the pain may be too late to be determined, and sleep on the wall - you can't turn over. Therefore, the ideal life is to suffer early, struggle early, and be bitter and then sweet. The most unfortunate thing is to be sweet and then bitter.", "timestamp": 1657375229, "digest": "sGA3dQsZ5Cdz41l7JjsZ2YIdrM481pW2oANGhAVl3FA", "contributor": "0x8A401F5711a17b2eeBA9bE2f6c9eda4B7B9DC671"}

We can tear our skins off, throw them on the ground, kick them a few feet, and walk away, dismissing them—— Yan Jiehe (former president of Pacific Group)\nOnly shameless people will become successful people—— Ren Zhengfei (president of Huawei)\nSticking to mistakes for face is the most shameless thing—— Wei Wei (editor in chief of Economic Journal)\nFace is a person's face. Chinese people especially love face. Some people even think that face is more important than life. As the saying goes, \"people fight for one breath, and Buddha fights for one incense\". Face not only affects people's consumption patterns, but also affects people's social interactions, and even determines a person's fate.\nIn history, there are many heroes who love face, such as Wu Song in Outlaws of the marsh. He is a man who loves face very much. After reading the notice, Wu Song knew that there were tigers on the mountain. He wanted to turn around and return to the hotel, but because he boasted to the shopkeeper before going up the mountain, he forced himself up the mountain. Wu Song himself did not expect that he could kill the tiger and become famous for fighting the tiger. There are also many people in China who have lost their lives in order to save face. The most typical one is Xiang Yu, who committed suicide by the side of the Wujiang River. After the defeat, he felt \"ashamed to see Jiangdong and his father\", so he committed suicide.\nOf course, there are those who don't \"love\" face or even \"don't care\" face.\nYan Jiehe, the former chairman of the board of directors of the Pacific Group, once said something controversial. He said, \"what is face? We never have face when we do big things. We can tear our face off and throw it on the ground, kick a few feet, and walk away, dismissing it.\" He believes that not taking himself seriously, not taking face seriously, and treating face as nothingness is the demeanor of a person who really does great things. Although his words are biased and sharp, for enterprises, the biggest problem they face in the early stage of entrepreneurship is the problem of face.\nAs we all know, Shi Yuzhu, Yu Minhong, Yan Jiehe and Chen Tianqiao are super rich, but no one knows how these entrepreneurs became super rich, what price they paid, what efforts they made, and how much humiliation and pain they endured that others could not bear. How many people are willing to pay the same price as them and obtain the same wealth as they do today?\nYu Minhong, the president of New Oriental, suffered from the hardship of face. Lu Yuegang, a reporter of China Youth Daily, recorded Yu Minhong's entrepreneurial experience in detail in his book \"Oriental carriage - the legend from Peking University to New Oriental\". There are many stories about Yu Minhong's entrepreneurial experience, which are still tearful to read.\nThe book describes Yu Minhong's drunkenness, which originated from an employee of New Oriental who was stabbed by a competitor with a knife. In order to deal with this matter, Yu Minhong invited a police friend he just met and asked him to invite a political commissar of the criminal police brigade to \"sit down\" Because Yu Minhong can't talk, only drink; Also because of his inner restlessness, Yu Minhong lost consciousness and went under the table just drinking instead of eating vegetables. The teacher and the police took him to the hospital and saved him for two and a half hours before he came back to life. The doctor said that if ordinary people drink like this, they can't come back.\nThat day, Yu Minhong drank a bottle and a half of Wuliangye, and almost died. The first sentence he shouted when he woke up was, \"I quit!\" On the way home from school, for more than an hour, he cried and cried, \"I'm quitting! -- never again! -- close the school! -- close the school! -- I'm quitting!\" He kept shouting, making the people around him nervous, crying enough, crying tired, sleeping, waking up, drunk. There was still class at 7 p.m. and he went to class with his bags on his back as usual. Tears are still in the corners of his eyes, but he can't do what he should do. According to Yu Minhong's own words, why go without a school?\nYu Minhong is also known for kneeling down in New Oriental School. Despite the opposition of the public, his mother recruited Yu Minhong's brother-in-law to New Oriental to work, first in charge of the canteen finance, and then the Distribution Department. For some reason, someone moved the office equipment of Yu Minhong's brother-in-law. Yu's mother was furious and cursed at school. The principal of New Oriental School, the \"Godfather\" of Chinese study abroad who was admired by thousands of people, knelt down to his mother \"plop\" in front of everyone.\nWang Qiang, who witnessed this, recalled afterwards: \"we expected Yu Minhong to walk in front of his mother, but he knelt down and immediately let me collapse! Human nature collapsed, dignity collapsed, and it was very painful.\" When an outsider sees such a scene, he still feels \"collapsed\" and \"very painful\". Then, as a party and kneeling person, what will Yu Minhong feel in his heart?\nYu Minhong has many legendary experiences, which can be said for several years in his words. In fact, face is the first obstacle in life. Smart people will never be people who \"die to face and suffer\". If they love face too much, they will lose opportunities. People who value themselves too much will be difficult to achieve great things. If you want to do big things, you can't take face too seriously. Those who became rich and successful in the early stage of reform and opening up, it is because they took off the mask of vanity that they embarked on the road to success. There are a large number of rich people who have become rich from the work of \"junk king\" and \"smelly cobbler\". Those who dare to be \"junk king\" and \"smelly cobbler\" themselves have different outlook on life and values from ordinary people.\nPhysical torture is nothing, but spiritual torture is fatal. If you want to start your own business, you must first ask yourself in your heart. In the face of all-round torture from physical to mental, do you have such a kind of \"concentration\" and \"spiritual power\" that you can't be surprised Sometimes, considering your face may lead to nothing in the end. Many returnees, government officials and well-educated people have a low probability of success when starting a business, because they are too shameful and have a good face.\nWe should be a pragmatic practitioner and show the courage to do great things without shame and without fear of losing face. The so-called shameless, is not to take yourself seriously, this society is not to your face, this society is to your wisdom and ability, depends on your actual achievements. Only when you break out and succeed can you have a face, otherwise no one will care about your face and your face.\nSometimes people can't do without forcing, because people themselves are lazy. When facing many challenges, pressures and difficulties, they must have an open mind, regard the cause as a revolution, and they are revolutionaries. Don't always think about the victory of the revolution in the future, and the question of whether to be chairman or general in the future. You should pin your head on your belt and think about the danger of dying at any time in order to survive the current difficulties. Your career is developed by constantly overcoming difficulties.\nWhat is face? Face is an excuse for people to avoid certain responsibilities. What supports face? If you can't even solve the problem of food and clothing, what's the use of having face? As long as it is not against the law, becoming rich will not be disgraced at any time. In the final analysis, the problem of face is actually the problem of people's ideas. As long as you work hard and operate formally, there is nothing worth worrying about. Face is so small in front of entrepreneurial ideals, so don't be surprised.\nAs the saying goes, \"die to face and live to suffer\" If you don't want to suffer, you should put down your ideological burden and go all out to do things. As long as you have a goal and a firm position, you can move towards the road to success in entrepreneurship. If you don't do a good job in your career, no matter how gorgeous your face is, the facts have the most say. Therefore, entrepreneurs should put aside their concerns, put down their face, and boldly move forward.\nThe prosperous times are rare, the market is cruel, and entrepreneurship is facing unprecedented challenges. How to improve their quality, put aside face and take courage to do their own business is a problem that every entrepreneur must seriously consider. Action is the best witness. Let go of face, frustration and firmness, and glory is ahead of you.", "timestamp": 1657374845, "digest": "siSNv1k1_YwWwKI--N-NBHbn_1dMWN_lBpqQNhduEV4", "contributor": "0xb7b9F924bDD958642FA1c058b4441c33cb9403e0"}

{"id": "YH4LtWXyC1aedinSfhjil2AfEOwnLo-01rhS-548-QA", "title": "The essence of inferiority complex", "body": "Everyone feels inferior. There are about two kinds of processes to form inferiority complex: first, in the process of comparing with adults in childhood, they have less profound experience than adults; Coupled with some environments that are not conducive to growth, the state of inferiority may solidify in the heart. Second, everyone knows his own things better than others. In his own vision, the mysterious side is unconsciously endowed with some equally mysterious power or aura.\nInferiority comes from the aggressiveness of all creatures. This aggressive way of presentation is to compare with others at the psychological and behavioral levels from time to time and everywhere. Comparison is competition, which means attacking others intellectually and physically.\nThe attack of the inferiors is mostly done in their hearts. In the face of a hypothetical competitor, the offensive automatic launch. If the opponent appears to be stronger than himself, the aggressiveness will soon turn towards him, and there will be the inner world of people with low self-esteem: self blame, depression, anxiety or fear. This complex and rapid process is usually invisible to inferiors and others.\nOn the surface, inferiority complex is to look down on yourself. However, if a person never looks down on others after comparing himself with others, he will not look down on himself after comparison. In other words, without attacking others, there will be no result of inferior skills and inferiority after failure.\nHaving a little inferiority complex is not a big problem. Excessive inferiority may have a negative impact on all aspects of life. The external manifestation of excessive inferiority complex can be completely opposite. Some people with low self-esteem make no secret of their low self-esteem and often show weakness and timidity in their words and deeds; Others with low self-esteem \"deceive themselves\", but their external manifestation is complacency, arrogance and self-confidence.\nDealing with people with excessive inferiority complex is a dangerous thing. Because their great aggressiveness does not disappear, but turns to themselves. Once the opportunity comes, these aggressiveness will attack others in unexpected ways. We see the fact that some people feel inferior to the extent that they are often bullied, and when they can't bear to fight back, it is usually \"a blockbuster\"\nThe performance of inward aggression, or inferiority complex, proves that this person's personality level has developed to a very high stage. Comparatively speaking, people who always release their original aggression are at a lower stage of psychological development. An extreme example is antisocial personality. They constantly attack others and society, cross the boundaries of the law, and are often punished by the law.\nA graduate student from a famous university told me how inferior he was. Specifically, I'm not satisfied with everything about myself, including appearance, figure, intelligence, performance, etc., and I also use a lot of sharp derogatory words for myself, which makes me feel heartache for him. Once, I said to him with emotion, \"you really look down on others.\" At that time, he was very surprised. A few months later, he told me that he went back to carefully understand the meaning of this sentence and began to learn to look down on or appreciate others. The miraculous effect was that slowly he forgot his inferiority complex.\nEveryone is a unique creation of nature, so everyone doesn't have to feel inferior. This sentence is equivalent to saying: everyone doesn't have to look down on himself by looking down on others. Heaven is on earth, and it will not stint to give those who lift others the power to lift themselves.", "timestamp": 1657375033, "digest": "soXaD5E-R-xbJS9yr-Fie2qMxe-8iJpzujw1ZAXTZxU", "contributor": "0x591dF88f21c391042Fe3f5cA7BEAc948C209262D"}

If there is a time point, I will put it in it. If there is no time point, I will put it on the first day of the month. If someone asks me the time, I will first look at the calendar arrangement. If some things conflict, I will not do them. If some things can be scheduled, I will put them into the calendar.\nWeekly view:\nAlthough I am a freelancer, my schedule naturally takes into account working days and holidays. For example, when everyone is on holiday, my schedule is relatively loose. Everyone doesn't work during the Spring Festival, and I will also arrange a long vacation or recharge. I also pay attention to the time arrangement. I usually don't only care about my own time, but also consider each other's. For example, today is Friday. Considering the weekend, I will send some schedules in advance, and they must be distributed during working hours, not after work, which others may not be able to deal with.\nDaily view:\nEvery morning or the night before, list the items that must be completed in this day (sometimes including the items of a week), put them in the todollist of the browser, complete one item and cross out one item. When arranging time, I usually have to look at the next three days or even a week, not just one day. If I need to go out, I may merge some matters and complete them on the way out.\nWhat I have to do every week:\n\n1. Communicate with the consulting enterprise whether it is necessary to go to the site;\n2. Progress control of several projects in hand;\n3. Monitoring the promotion and sales of books and planning activities;\n4. Training preparation;\n5. Learning plan (generally combined with work, learning as needed).\n   What I have to do every day:\n6. Complete all affairs according to the schedule, divided by priority and importance.\n7. Communicate with different enterprises, mainly online, and meet when necessary. Read all kinds of enterprise materials.\n8. Communicate with my partners about the progress of various affairs, especially with Akiba.\n9. Take time to write wechat pictures and texts, publish them, and respond to questions online within a short period of time after publishing. It is said that after the subscription number is folded, the pictures and texts may not be seen immediately, but it is observed that some people receive and leave messages immediately. Close the web page after you are busy, and reply when you have time. Sometimes outside, I will check through my mobile phone, but usually I don't reply, and it will be carried out in centralized time.\n   After work and study, of course, there is life. Generally, after finishing a task, they will get up for a walk, drink water, and do some simple exercises. Cooking. I will relax my mind by eliminating love every day, and sometimes I will run cool.\n   I focus on a game and hope to study it thoroughly. At the same time, it is really fun. In the time when love is eliminated for one minute every day, I must first focus on it, and then I will find some interesting places: for example, if I miss an explosive pig on time, my brain will jam, and because of this error, I will get a low score. This will make me reflect on my weakness in character, because in such a short time, the direct response is the most real, and I can't deceive myself - I am willing to face up to my weakness in character and improve, so I will explore in many ways.\n   I don't go shopping very much. Many items are online shopping, which also belongs to my time management plan. achieve greater , faster , better and more economical results.\n   I often go out to meet friends, but I see fewer and better people, and there are many emotional factors. I am willing to pay for the people I like and around me. I always feel that I need to take care of myself and the people around me first. What qualifications does an unhappy person have to point out the way of happiness to others?\n   Of course, everyone has different definitions of happiness. I think I'm very happy. Some people disagree. I'm a Q spirit. I don't follow their standards and stay away from them - this also belongs to the time management scheme, because in this way, they can't spend my time.\n   I also exercise. I like walking, watching the scenery on the roadside and emptying my mind. I ride a folding car. From my home to the subway, I ride my bike, and then take the car to the subway. The folding car can enter the subway. I usually use walking stairs to go up and down in the last or front carriage, so as to avoid causing people trouble as much as possible.\n   I make lemon honey and yogurt by myself. I pay attention to diet and maintain a balanced nutrition. I understand my physical condition and make corresponding work arrangements. Unless necessary, I don't get too tired and force myself. I like cooking, not only to enjoy my stomach, but also to practice my hands.\n   In the above description, there are three key words:\n   Overall planning, calm and lead time\n   I make plans according to the year, month, week and day. Some things will change. I don't insist. I make my own efforts. Results oriented. I pursue professionalism, which is also a kind of fun. I hope that the people I work with are very professional. This requires a collision screening process. From the process of two years, the situation is getting better and better.\n   I usually don't rush to do it when things come to an end. For example, I will work out a PPT first. It's not time to put it away. In a few days, I'll take it out, read it, revise it, and then send it out. Many people already know my time habits. I will make an appointment in advance when I have something to do. I think it's good.\n   Calm is very important. If you are in a hurry, you are easy to be eager for quick success and instant benefits, and easy to make mistakes. Slow down and think carefully, you can have better results. Inspiration and creativity often come from being calm and slow, but it takes a sudden storm to take action.\n   I love life, the world and my life, so I am willing to explore time management in busy and leisure, which is my pleasure.", "timestamp": 1657375171, "digest": "RmImcNgP9z_50OaZc-utqtFOvCnPiy4F5azUbJ7Uhdo", "contributor": "0x0FAe937faFaff13f8eBE6143C66c834cF4561649"}
{"id": "6HNWfnak4jGuXzdwpjwXFIj3UpUPJaRJkE6G-cZJnEw", "title": "Value of failure ", "body": "Success is not necessarily beneficial to people, and failure is not necessarily harmful.\nIn fact, we all seem to have understood the harm of being proud of victory and being indomitable to defeat. But people may not dare to believe that if they are not discouraged and still fail repeatedly, will they still be able to consciously benefit and take it calmly? Since we say that failure is the mother of success, if there is no hope of success after all, does failure still have value?\nWe should say that failure can have an absolute value, which does not need to be confirmed by future success. This value is the value of wisdom and virtue.\nEvery failure we encounter can make us better understand the limits of our knowledge, ability and experience, the advantages and disadvantages of our whole personality, and our reasonable position in this social environment. In a word, it is to let us know ourselves better.\nEvery failure can also stimulate us to make more efforts and conditioning for the weakness of our knowledge, ability and character, so as to make our image more complete. And let us stand more stable in our own position, so as to increase our self-knowledge and self-confidence.\nSelf knowledge is a kind of wisdom, self-confidence is a kind of virtue, and their value is absolute. And this absolute value can come not only from the experience of success, but also from the lessons of failure, or rather, more often from failure. Because success is too easy to get carried away, while failure is always unforgettable. That's why Mencius said that he could move his mind to be patient and increase what he couldn't.\nTherefore, I often wish to persuade people not to be afraid to do things. Because if you succeed, you will be honored; If you fail, you will also get wisdom. In any case, people will never fail.\nOf course, in addition, the lessons of failure are still enough to guide future success. But if we know that even if we don't succeed, failure is not in vain, then we really stand in an invincible position.", "timestamp": 1657375309, "digest": "gHz0jv0uHBvVa5bJYZVayMWWiizhkU7H-Tj7q52k2to", "contributor": "0xA2c6e20D223d496cd0c0b6ed57cA05233c910327"}
{"id": "arpKlY1ESrzdttHkViAYDqcWKgfYXzEqU-h-gZv4MHs", "title": "If you don't want to be poor, please watch it", "body": " 1. Remember, those who watch TV for more than three hours a day on average must have a monthly income of no more than 2000 yuan. If you want to earn more than 2000 yuan a month, please don't waste your time on TV. Similarly, those who play online games or chat for more than three hours a day on average also have a monthly income of less than twothousand.\n 2. Because there are many poor people and they have no money, they chat and complain on the Internet to kill time. Have you ever met a boss or manager in charge of an enterprise who often chats in QQ group when he has nothing to do?\n 3. In this world, there is such a small group of people who open the newspaper, their news, turn on the TV, their news, and talk about their news in the streets and lanes, as if the world is prepared for them, and they can call the wind and rain, and do everything. Your goal should be to become this small group of people.\n 4. If you really love your parents and your girlfriend, just fight hard. Only in this way can you have the ability, financial conditions and free time to accompany them and love them well.\n 5. In this society, fast fish eat slow fish, not slow fish eat fast fish.\n 6. In this society, winners take all and losers have nothing. Society is always a hero based on success or failure.\n 7. If you ask your friends about a certain industry, if ten people and nine people say they can't do it, then it is likely that this is an opportunity. If ten or nine people say they can do it, it is a sunset industry.\n 8. In any industry or market, meat comes first, and later soup is not available.\n 9. In this world, first-class talents can make third rate projects second rate or better. However, the third rate talents will not do the first-class projects as well as the third rate ones.\n10. Go out and have a look while you are young. It's better to read thousands of books than to travel thousands of miles. It's better to read countless people than to travel thousands of miles.\n11. When dealing with people, listen more and speak less. This is why God gives us a mouth and two ears.\n12. Remember, to be the last player, sell the cards that others think are unexpected, when they think you are going to lose, so that you can win the game.\n13. Don't pretend to be big. For the person who pretends to be big, the best way is to pick up a brick, follow it quietly, and put him down from behind at once.\n14. Don't say dirty words casually, which will make others feel that you are not self-restraint and are unwilling to associate with you. Even communication is perfunctory. Because his heart believes that your quality is very poor.\n15. When you want to smoke, first ask the people around you if you can, and learn to respect others. Don't play cool and smoke in front of girls. You don't know, in fact, they are very disgusted inside.\n16. When buying clothes, you should choose them by yourself. Don't let your family buy them for you. Although what you bought the first time and the second time is not very good, you will gradually have an eye.\n17. If you want to make progress, you can only learn lessons and constantly summarize and innovate. Successful experiences are distorted. If you succeed, you can say whatever you want. Losers have no say. However, you can learn the methods and spirit of successful people. So make more friends with successful people and don't learn the negative thoughts and behaviors of losers.\n18. Study, study, and study again. No matter how busy your work is, you should take time to read more books and participate in more studies in all aspects of society, so that you can get a lot. The competition in this society is too fierce. If you don't study, you will be eliminated. When you graduate from University, your study is not over, but has just begun. The biggest illiterate in the 21st century will no longer be those who have not gone to school, but those who have stopped studying since leaving campus.\n19. If you are not a singer, painter or performance art player, please pay attention to your clothes at ordinary times. Now in this society, clothes can show which group and circle you belong to.\n20. If a young man doesn't have any ideas in three years, his life will be basically like this, and there will be little change.\n21. A successful person is bold and courageous. I once heard people talk about the success of Wenzhou people on the train, saying \"bold\" In fact, this is courage, and if you can afford it and put it down, it is courage.\n22. No matter whether you are in the sales department or not, you should read books about marketing. Because in life, you are selling yourself to others everywhere.\n23. At ordinary times, communicate more with your friends. Don't wait until you need their help to think of contacting them. In society, you will know how difficult it is to meet a true friend.\n24. If you want to know your annual income in the future, find six friends who are the most frequent friends around you and think they have a good relationship. Add up their annual income and divide it by six, it's almost yours. This example can fully illustrate that birds of a feather flock together.\n25. Set yourself a five-year goal, and then break it down into one year, half a year, three months, one month or even one week. In this way, you can find your goal and direction. The most afraid thing in life is that there is no goal and direction, which leads to many people being at a loss.\n26. Whenever you remember the word dignity, you should have dignity, principles and bottom line in life. Otherwise, no one will respect you.\n27. If I can only give you one piece of advice, that is, there is no free lunch in this world, never take shortcuts, and believe that down-to-earth, God rewards hard work.\n    If you don't want to be poor, just keep looking. Whether you are a man or a woman, if you want to succeed in life, you must:\n28. This is a realistic society, where feelings cannot be eaten, and poor couples are sad about everything. Don't believe the story in the movie, it's just a place for many strangers to make noise. Only irrational and unrealistic people believe.\n29. Set a goal for yourself. One year, two years, five years, maybe your birth is not as good as others, but as long as you have ambition and work hard, you can often change 70% of your destiny. Broken cans can only be friends with cowardice.\n30. Friends invite you to dinner, don't take it for granted, please reciprocate, otherwise your reputation will get worse and worse.\n31. Among good friends, we must cultivate a bosom friend. Don't think you are so versatile and full of friends. Finally, there is only one true to you, believe me.\n32. Don't believe in divination, horoscopes and fates. It's to coax children. Fate is in your own hands. It's better to have a good dream than to sit at home and wait for a house or a car.\n33. Don't touch people you don't like, but don't speak ill of them behind their backs. People who say right and wrong must be right and wrong. Remember, misfortune comes from the mouth.\n34. Play less games, you can't get a house, a car and capital. You can have hobbies, but you should grasp the scale and play less highly attractive promotion games such as farms, pastures and landlords. Maybe your level is very high, but it doesn't mean how successful you are, but it will affect and occupy your successful time.\n35. Everyone is born with inertia, but we can change this inertia the day after tomorrow, because many people are changing. Don't wait for others to do something or business before you think of it. Don't wait for others to make money before you want to do it yourself. What no one believes is the market and opportunity. What everyone believes is inflation.\n36. Know what you want to do. In the dead of night, ask yourself your future plans and realize them in that direction, instead of doing nothing and doing something meaningless. We must have a sense of hardship. There is no crisis in life, that is the biggest crisis.\n37. The way out, the way out, there will always be a way out. Difficulties and tribulations, trapped at home is difficult.\n38. As a woman, don't sell off your old age by thinking that your career has nothing to do with you. It's a big mistake to think that you are just washing clothes, cooking and looking after children. In the end, it's easy to be abandoned by the man you love.\n39. To be a man, we should give priority to filial piety, teach children the way of morality, make couples harmonious and beautiful, and be happy for thousands of years. But these can't be done with words. You need to pay a lot of money and time. Smart people know this truth.\n40. In your spare time, don't often surf the Internet to do boring things and play meaningless games. Read some literary works and learn some business processes, management norms, international current affairs, legal knowledge, marriage and family, parent-child education, etc. This can ensure that you can talk at any party.\n41. It's better to kill 1000 times of information from all aspects by mistake than to miss any chance of success. Only in this way can you not buy regret medicine.\n42. There is no need to tell others before you succeed in doing something. After success, you don't have to say, others will know. This is the effect of the information age.\n43. Take good care of your hair, nails and beard. Society is an exclusive acceptor, and the artists needed by this planet are extremely limited. Please don't take this risk. Even if you look good with long hair, you should try to give people a clean feeling.\n44. Don't think you are a man, so you don't need maintenance. At least you can't eat too casually. No matter how busy your breakfast is, you should remember to eat before you have the energy to do things. Don't smoke and drink too much. Usually eat more tomatoes, seafood, leeks, bananas, all of which are good for men's health. If you can't see the value, I can tell you that at least you can buy more skin care products for your woman with the money saved from seeing a doctor.\n45. Those who strive to make progress should not always think about who to rely on. People are selfish, and they are the most reliable people.\n46. In the face of failure, don't worry too much. Heaven will lower the responsibility to others. You must first work hard, strain your muscles and bones, and starve your skin... But you should learn to blame yourself, find the reason, learn to summarize, and then get rid of bad habits. It's normal to have no money at the age of 20; At the age of 30, without money, you may not have a good family, so you need to make greater efforts; I have no money at the age of 40, so I can only find the reason by myself. It is possible, and very likely, for the poor to become rich. It is also inevitable that the poor can be poor for a lifetime. Existence is the reason, but there is only a choice. As the saying goes: a man stands in his thirties. A man should spend all his time to realize when he is thirty. The sooner you wake up, the more likely you are to change. If you don't wake up well, it may be more difficult next.", "timestamp": 1657375367, "digest": "XmZ9ZsOA8DlYbYroBGqm91wco6cm63MIrf9UvD1A1OI", "contributor": "0x32c021E193cc56Dd8446d62661949E2A58a609a3"}
{"id": "_tLGqHMSGL2ASFVZAQ3_vCCi_m_TrFTeAfU1tsrUtl0", "title": "How can I have strong positive energy all the time", "body": "There are always two kinds of people around us: one kind of people feels restless all day long, always energetic and energetic. The other kind of look makes you depressed, gloomy, listless and confused. In contrast, the former is more like a child, and the latter is more like an old man. What could have caused such a completely different result? That depends on the amount of our own life energy!\nWhen it comes to energy, we immediately think of solar energy, oil, electricity, wind energy, etc. What is life energy?\nThe research results of modern quantum mechanics reveal the fact that everything in the world is composed of energy. All the substances we can see are composed of particles that are small to almost equal to none. They vibrate at high speed at different frequencies to form an energy field. In fact, all kinds of substances are energy with different vibration frequencies.\nIf you observe carefully, you will find that some people are always energetic and passionate, and their words, deeds and every move have strong appeal and appeal. When you are with him, you can't help feeling happy; While some people are always pessimistic, depressed, negative and lazy. When they are with him, everyone feels inexplicably depressed and unhappy; Some people exude the energy of joy and love, just like beautiful flowers in bloom, bringing a pleasant feeling to everyone who approaches him; Some people are full of cold, selfish and suspicious energy, which may scare away people who want to be close to him.\nAlthough there are many different types of energy, for human energy field, we can divide energy into two categories: negative energy and positive energy.\nWhat makes us negative, depressed, self abased, depressed, lose our fighting spirit, and can't find fun and goals in life is extremely bad negative energy. The more a person's vibration form of life exists in a state of negative energy, his life may become worse. What makes us full of enthusiasm and confidence, makes us optimistic, positive, sunny and confident forever, and enables us to show infinite charm is beautiful positive energy.\nIf we can consciously keep ourselves in a positive energy field, then success and happiness will be possible.\nWhy do different energies lead to completely different results in our lives? This is because energy is attractive and infectious.\nThe so-called attractiveness means that the energy of the same vibration frequency will attract each other and cause resonance. So negative energy tends to attract bad things, while positive energy attracts good things.\n\"House leakage happens to be rainy\", \"icing on the cake\", \"good things in pairs\" and so on are all about the attraction and resonance of energy. In addition, energy is also infectious. If we spend a long time with someone with certain energy, we will infect his energy. \"He who comes near is red, and he who comes near is black\" is all about the infectivity of energy.\nSo, how can we make ourselves have strong positive energy all the time?\nSecret 1: lock your focus\nOur life, the proportion of positive and negative energy we have is completely determined by our perspective and mentality, that is, the focus of attention! When we can control the focus of our attention, we will grasp the initiative of life.\nThe most important principle of the law of energy is: the more we focus on, the more we are. If we transmit and emit a lot of negative energy to ourselves, others and the world, this negative energy will first be fed back to ourselves, and the negative energy in our lives will increase catastrophically; If we can sincerely transmit and transmit the energy of love, gratitude and appreciation to ourselves, others and the world, it is ourselves who are first nourished by the energy of love, gratitude and appreciation, and our life will be better and better. Happiness, success and joy will always be with us.\nSecret 2: don't resist negative energy, you can only transform it\nA very important law in the principle of energy is that what we conflict with, what we fear, and what we try to eliminate will surely persist. Because no matter what we resist, what we fear, what we fear, we are paying attention to it, and paying attention to them means giving it energy. Therefore, what we resist will often persist, and its energy will become stronger and stronger.\nSecret 3: manage the language, audio-visual and living environment\nOur language is a kind of energy with extremely high frequency. When we are blessing others, we are actually being blessed; When we curse others, we are also cursed; When we attack others, we are actually attacking ourselves. 10000 times we attack others is equivalent to 10000 times we attack ourselves, because we are the one who is most loyal to our feelings.\nSecret 4: sharing brings more beautiful energy\nIn life, the more we offer and give, the more people we help, the more valuable our life will be, and the stronger our positive energy will be. When we are stingy with giving and giving, life begins to wither.\nSecret 5: love and gratitude create the greatest positive energy in the world\nThanksgiving goes through time and space to change our past; Thanksgiving shapes joy and shows our present; Thank you for making your dreams come true and creating our future. Those who know how to be grateful must have love in their hearts. Those who have love will be full of expectations for life, and those who have expectations will pursue happiness. In this process, we will unconsciously seek and actively obtain positive energy.\nThe so-called \"giving roses to others and leaving lingering fragrance\" here is actually a manifestation of positive energy.\nThose who complain will only be forgotten in the corner and feel sorry for themselves. Because of the lack of positive energy in their lives, if a person learns and tries to pay attention to beauty, share, be grateful, give love, and let himself live in the sunshine and laughter.

{"id": "qZuXYBaMwHLDP7iSmSbHg5o3mUO_hDWEdejofpoazXE", "title": "Three disadvantageous mindsets that hinder life", "body": "On the road of life, there are three kinds of mindsets that are the most dangerous. No matter how powerful this person is, once there is one of these three mindsets, it will leave too many hidden dangers on the road of pursuit, which will greatly affect success and happiness. There are three disadvantageous attitudes that hinder a person's success in life: complaining, doing your best, and self pity.\nThe first mentality that hinders life: complaining\nFirst, let's talk about complaining. No matter in life or work, complaining is always a poison. Complaints in life will turn the wife into a resentful wife, turn the husband into a coward, and make people dare not face a little twists and turns in life, thus affecting the whole family relationship. Now most divorces are also caused by complaints; Complaints at work will make people careless about work, make people unable to see opportunities and success, thus affecting interpersonal relationships. Although they work hard, they have no work performance and do nothing.\nFrom the perspective of psychology, complainers are a kind of self-confidence, because they don't believe that their abilities can change the environment and the people around them. Therefore, when they encounter things, their first thought is how to eliminate the responsibility from themselves, so they will always blame others, everyone around them, everything, and they will feel that everything is unfair to themselves, and their purpose is to excuse themselves, Is to find a good reason for yourself when you can't solve the problem. Moreover, people who complain for a long time cannot have a strong mentality of success, and are unwilling to face things and solve problems with all their heart. They always hope that everything can be very ideal, can be as they imagine, and can have results beyond their expectations without any effort. What is more serious is that if you complain for a long time, your psychology will change, you will have many unreasonable ideas, you will feel that everything is unfair, you will feel that all people and things are aimed at yourself, and you will be hostile to everything around you; Then they will become haggard about any small thing, but they are unwilling to spend their time to solve the problem.\nGenerally, people who complain lose their sense of responsibility, because in the long-term complaint, such people will not introspect, can not see their own problems clearly, and will not understand the dominant position of a person in all things, will completely ignore the power of the ID factor, and will think that everything is because of the environment, and will feel that the role of people is too small. People need to clearly find themselves. People who don't know themselves will become ignorant, will have no bottom in their hearts, will be unsure of themselves, will dare not take responsibility, and will think of how to shirk responsibility before doing anything.\nTherefore, there are often couples who complain about each other because of various problems and eventually divorce. These people have never thought that no matter what kind of problems they encounter, as a person, they should find ways to solve them, instead of complaining about the unfairness of society or the incomprehension of the other party, they should find more reasons from themselves. To give some simple examples, now the society often complains that the house price is high and can't afford to get married, blaming this society for being unfair, and blaming some girls and families for being jealous of money. In fact, this is also a kind of abnormal thinking. For such a problem, what we should want is not to complain, but to work hard to make money on the one hand, and on the other hand, find ways to make the girl and her family change the idea that they must get married only after a house. Both of them are difficult, but they are not impossible. If you really work hard, you can really let the other party see your efforts. Even if you are not a blue chip stock now, most people are still willing to invest in potential stocks. But if you don't work hard and fight for it, it can only be a junk stock, and you don't have to blame others for not daring to invest.\nThe same is true at work. We often hear some voices, including those complaining about customers, companies, leaders, colleagues and the market. There are all kinds of voices; However, these voices never think about why there is time to complain, instead of trying to solve these problems? Complainers often have no sunshine in their hearts, nor can they see the beauty of the world, let alone pursue success and happiness.\nThe second mentality that hinders life: do your best\nThe so-called best effort is to do something or not, and in many cases, it is to do nothing. The essence is very simple. All people who say they try their best, even if they don't do anything, will feel that they try their best. Friends and colleagues often chat with me for life and work reasons, and I always like to ask, \"did you really try your best?\" Not many people dare to give me a positive answer, because from their replies, we can see that they didn't try their best at all, and most people didn't even try their best.\nDoing your best is also an excuse to avoid responsibility, and it is also an expression of lack of confidence in yourself. You don't believe that you will succeed at all, so give yourself an excuse in advance. In case you don't succeed, tell yourself that you have tried your best, and the failure is due to other reasons. For life, no matter what things are solved, you should tell yourself to be like a soldier. If you don't succeed, you will die on the battlefield. Although you are defeated, you are still proud; And we can't be like a coward who doesn't dare to fight with all his strength and dare not fight at all. Things are spelled out. If you don't spell them, no one can help, and no one can solve the problem.\nDoing your best is doing something or not, or doing nothing; Try your best, it's better to be benevolent if you don't succeed. This is the way to achieve success.\nThe third mentality that hinders life: self pity\nFinally, there is self pity. Because of different life experiences, many people will always feel that they are different, and they will always feel that they should have some advantages in psychology, so as to become overly self-centered, guard constantly, and have an excessive sense of self-protection. For such people, in fact, it is very contradictory. On the one hand, they will emphasize their own personal abilities and refuse others thousands of miles; On the other hand, he likes to rely on others, hopes others to help him succeed, thinks that others should help him, and thinks that others owe him.\nSuch a state of mind will lead to being too sensitive when judging things and getting along with people, so that you can't see yourself and the surrounding things clearly. Living completely in a closed space built by yourself will make communication difficult, and will also show some ideas that are too selfish or incomprehensible to most people on many issues.\nFrom the perspective of psychology, the emergence of this mentality lies in that this person can't face the reality, can only live in the past experience and shadow, dare not really face the problems encountered in real life, and have no courage to think about ways to solve problems with innovative thinking. In a deep sense, it is a kind of self-protection consciousness formed outside and inside by internal inferiority complex afraid of being discovered, Most people with this mentality will show conceit or pride, but this kind of performance is false, just to hide their inferiority.\nNo matter which kind of mentality above, it will greatly affect the exertion of personal ability, hinder people's success, and make you unable to see yourself and your environment clearly. If there are two or three of them, it will be more serious, and even in the end, it will not only accomplish nothing, the family will not be happy, but also there is likely to be psychological problems.", "timestamp": 1657375503, "digest": "HWqzgR1xqTBk5TwPp_Oa-8T2tROCzaTYArtnzVGoJQ4", "contributor": "0x86D9a0E437f663CC6a28756260F4CF6E26aC692a"}

{"id": "obN2jpXz_hwg9E9NwoldtyPPMTbzotaF63Xap0sdVaw", "title": "Why are more and more young people eager for success", "body": "Recently, a survey of 2075 people conducted by the social survey center of China Youth Daily through public opinion [china.com](http://china.com) and [sina.com](http://sina.com) showed that 93.3% of the respondents felt that the current youth's anxiety for success was more common. Among the respondents, the Post-70s accounted for 35.0%, and the post-80s accounted for 47.5%\nWhy are more and more young people eager for success\n\"There is a popular saying on the Internet: the back waves of the Yangtze River push the front waves, and the front waves die on the beach.\" Han Xiaohan, a white-collar post-80s generation in Beijing, said that this is a common anxiety. If a person has not achieved much by the age of 30, he is likely to do nothing in his life until he retires.\nZhou Hong, a librarian at Xinshao No. 1 middle school in Shaoyang, Hunan Province, said that the media often hype cases of \"juvenile success\". There is a book called \"success as soon as possible - teach you how to earn 5million before you are 30\". This seems to tell the current youth that they should hurry to attend famous schools, earn big money and seize power. This is success.\nWhere is the \"early\" mentality most obvious? According to the survey, the top three are \"making money\" (75.7%), \"being famous\" (49.5%) and \"buying a house\" (52.1%). Others include promotion (50.2%), marriage (31.8%), having children (23.1%), etc.\nZhou Qian, an employee of a private enterprise in Beijing, has been afraid to answer calls from home recently because she has been pressed too hard. Looking back on his nearly 30 years of life, it seems that everything is \"urged\" by his mother. When she went to school, her mother urged Zhou Qian to go to college and refuse all her hobbies; After graduating from college, my mother urged me to find a decent job; Enter the workplace, and urge to find someone, get married quickly; This year is the year of the dragon. My mother often calls to urge her to have a \"dragon baby\"\n\"As long as you talk on the phone, it's about having children, because people have had 'Dragon babies'. Is this my life or someone else's life?\" Zhou Qian said.\nSun Shijin, Dean of the Department of psychology of Fudan University, said in an interview with the reporter of China Youth Daily that from a psychological point of view, a person's childhood has the greatest impact on the formation of later personality. At present, most of the young people are only children and grow up in a sense of urgency. Their childhood education is \"don't lose at the starting line\" At the same time, some parents will unconsciously give their children their worries and insecurities.\nGu Yingchun, vice president of the Chinese Sociological Society and a professor at Zhejiang University, said that the important reason for the mentality of \"everything as soon as possible\" is that \"in the period of social transformation, the whole people are impetuous\" Nowadays, the frame of reference of public opinion is biased. Success is always linked to money, power, fame, status and other factors.\nGuan Jian, an associate professor of social psychology at Nankai University, pointed out that the current social system only rewards some short-term behaviors. \"Sharpening a sword in ten years\" is not recognized, but people who \"sharpen a knife in one year\" are more likely to be recognized. Individuals are particularly vulnerable to the influence and hint of others in the environment, which also leads to more and more young people eager for success, hoping to quickly obtain material benefits and social status.\nThe survey shows that the primary reason for young people to have the psychology of \"everything as soon as possible\" is \"the wind of impetuous anxiety in society\" (75.9%), followed by \"pressure from parents and peers\" (54.8%), and the third is \"blindly following a single value\" (48.4%).\n54% of people think that youth should do everything as soon as possible is an act of overdraft in the future\nWhat problems will arise from the psychology of \"everything as soon as possible\"? 75.0% felt that it would make people more eager for quick success and instant benefits; 69.0% believed that it would increase the impetuous atmosphere in society; 65.5% of people choose to make money worship and materialism more rampant; 55.6% pointed out that it would make the standard of success more and more single.\nSun Shijin believes that the only child is a group with strong achievement motivation. They work and live with the expectations of their parents and even the whole family, which leads them to want to be recognized immediately. However, if there is no solid foundation, individuals are easy to encounter setbacks and blows in this process, bear a stronger sense of frustration and powerlessness, and even produce psychological diseases.\nGu Yingchun pointed out that this will make young people's mentality impetuous, it is difficult to calm down and think about what they want, and will become more eager for quick success and instant benefits, and even unscrupulous. \"The so-called resentment of women, the phenomenon of fighting for fathers, counterfeiting, and the rampant practice of thick and dark learning are all the products of this psychology.\"\nIn the survey, 54.0% of the people believed that young people are eager to succeed as soon as possible, which is an act of overdraft in the future.\n\"I think this will make the whole society lack creativity and vitality.\" Guan Jian said that many young people will have the problem of weight versus quality. In academia, scholars will not spend decades to complete a book, but rush to publish a book a year. In terms of technology, there may be small inventions every year, but there will be no big innovations. In the long run, the overall development of the country will be built on a loose foundation, which is very dangerous.\nIn the survey, 88.2% of the respondents admitted that the current popular view of \"no hope without success at the age of 30\" has brought great pressure to young people.\nFor the view that \"there is no hope if you are not successful at the age of 30\", 65.9% opposed it, 14.4% agreed, and 19.7% said it was hard to say.\nSo, what is the best age for success? In the survey, 64.3% of people preferred \"30-40 years old\"; 28.5% thought it was \"40-50 years old\"; 11.3% chose \"18-30 years old\"; 3.9% of people choose \"50-60 years old\" Another 16.1% said \"any age is OK\"\n53\\.1% believed that the society should form a diversified standard of success\nHow should young people deal with the anxiety of \"everything as soon as possible\"? 66.2% of the people hoped that the youth would think independently and not blindly follow the crowd; 63.5% of the people suggested that young people should stick to the right path.\n\"Youth is capital. There is no need for anxiety or inferiority complex.\" Liu Lei, an employee of Yicheng suburban middle school in Zaozhuang City, Shandong Province, said that we should firmly believe that everyone's potential is huge. No matter what you do, persistence is the key.\nSun Shijin said that in this impetuous wind, it is very important for young people to learn to know themselves. First of all, ask yourself, \"why can't I slow down? Life is like a long-distance race. Is everything you encounter now really as terrible as you think?\" Then, with the spirit of introspection to think, dare to adhere to their own decisions.\nIn the survey, 57.9% of people hope that the social environment will be more tolerant of young people, so that young people can grow up easily and freely; 50.7% of the people expect the media to guide them correctly and report the events of \"juvenile success\" rationally.\n\"Now many parents have actually lost the potential of teenagers and delayed their future.\" Sun Shijin said that what parents should really give their children is a stable, safe and calm attitude. As the saying goes, \"children and grandchildren have their own blessings\" Enlightened parents should be tolerant, understanding and supportive of their children, and do not plan them according to their own intentions.\nGuan Jian suggested that the social reward mechanism should be improved from the perspective of encouraging long-term planning, so that young people can boldly step forward and take every step steadily.\nGu Yingchun called on the mass media to shoulder more social responsibilities and weaken some \"juvenile success\" events. At the same time, we should pay more attention to publicity, and how successful people overcome difficulties and tide over difficulties in the process of achieving goals.\nIn the survey, 53.1% believed that the society should form a diversified standard of success.\nWhat should be the criterion for judging success? The survey shows that the top two are \"realizing self-worth\" (76.2%) and \"happy family\" (60.9%).\nThe next is: social status (44.9%), making enough money (42.3%), owning a house and car (30.4%), getting married and having children (22.5%), power (19.7%), fame (12.0%).", "timestamp": 1657375599, "digest": "GGMHEXWHoSOPhYg0JP_0_yU-HDD7pTr8cg8pZIgc68Q", "contributor": "0x75A6c4C69241F500988715e4860ee5449BdCf89e"}

It's unpleasant, but it's a rare opportunity. Such a person is the easiest to succeed.\nIf you compete with others and are despised by your opponents, you will win the chance to defeat your opponents. The art of war says, know yourself and know your enemy, and you will be invincible in a hundred battles. How can your opponent defeat you if he underestimates your strength and neglects to deal with it? During the Three Kingdoms period, many heroes won by showing weakness.\nVolunteering to do things, or being promoted to shoulder important tasks, and being despised by colleagues, partners and brothers and friends, is your opportunity to stand out.\nPeople belittle you. They belittle your strength, not what you want to do. In their view, only those who have strength can be appointed.\nCao Cao issued an edict to gather heroes from all over the world to attack Dong Zhuo. Fight against Hua Xiong, and the \"alliance to discuss Dong\" is a major general. Guan Yu volunteered, and Yuan Shu shouted at the \"horse Archer\": \"do you deceive our princes that there is no great general?\"\nIn the era of cold weapons, there were many battles between soldiers and generals on the battlefield. In the eyes of Yuan Shu and the princes, the allies should be the top general in the war against general Dong Zhuo. Guan Yu killed Hua Xiong with warm wine, and everyone showed their points on the spot: outstanding generals. With this judgment, before the tiger prison, Liu, Guan and Zhang had the opportunity to fight Lv Bu together and move towards the big stage of displaying their talents.\nZhugeliang was a beginner, and Guan Yu and Zhang Fei looked down on him: \"Confucius is young next year, what talent and learning is there?\" At Bo Wang Po, Zhugeliang burned back Cao Cao's 100000 soldiers. Guan and Zhang bowed down: \"Kongming is really a hero.\" In their view, young people are resourceful and intelligent. With the cooperation of Guan and Zhang, Kongming's wisdom began to shine in the sky of history.\nSometimes, people who look down on you look down on your strength and look up to the difficulty of what you do. People are fully aware of difficulties, will not have extravagant hopes for you, and will create some conditions for you.\nThe \"alliance to fight against Dong\" was killed by Hua Xiong, and the highest wish of the alliance leader Yuan Shao was that someone would stop Hua Xiong. Guan Yu fought against the enemy, and Cao Cao did not expect him to cut Hua Xiong with a knife. He persuaded Yuan Shu, \"if it is impossible, it is not too late to blame\", to get an arrow and serve Zhuang Xing wine for Guan Yu.\nIf you want to seize the opportunity to be looked down upon, you have to be calm. The sky doesn't say you're proud, and the earth doesn't say you're kind. Lu Xun was underestimated by the civil ministers and generals of the eastern Wu Dynasty, so he could calm down. Sun Quan worshipped him as the governor, and there was a lot of opposition in the court: Lu Xun, a scholar, could not bear the heavy responsibility. When the promotion was discussed, the generals refused: \"order this child to be a general, and Soochow will rest.\" He showed his respect\nSword, the generals \"although the mouth promised, the heart is not satisfied.\" He didn't care at all, but also showed weakness to Guan Yu and Liu Bei, making them look down on themselves.

Not only that, all Western instruments are used to \"play\", while all our instruments are used to \"practice\". The biggest difference between the two is that in the face of the same inevitable failure process, \"play\" people regard failure as a normal part of the process, and are good at using the power and fun brought by \"failure\". However, the \"drill\" personnel try their best to avoid failure. Although the process is the same, the attitude towards music and even life in the future is quite different.\nTherefore, it is very important to find an attitude, even an idea of \"playing\", and learn to get along with the inevitable failure in life.\nWhen I first entered the hospital for internship, I was young and confident, but I was often scolded by senior doctors because of my lack of experience. At that time, I felt both distressed and frustrated. Then one day, I chatted with a very excellent senior who was one year higher than me. I asked him, \"did you get scolded when you were an intern?\"\n\"Of course.\" He said.\nI was startled. It turned out that even doctors as good as him would be scolded. So I asked, \"have you calculated how many times you were scolded when you became an intern in a year?\"\nHe thought for a moment and said, \"say it less than seventy or eighty times.\"\nAfter talking with him, I feel much better. I think, if even he has to be scolded 70 or 80 times, then, with my qualifications, being an intern for a year, if he can be scolded less than 100 times, it should also be an achievement. So I set myself a goal - \"100 times scolded\" I made a form with 100 boxes on it. Every time I was scolded, I would record the time and reason of being scolded in one box.\nAfter starting such a \"new way of playing\", the mood became different. Of course, being scolded is still scolded, but every time you are scolded, no matter how embarrassed, you feel like \"scoring in the game\". That feeling is very complex, a little like the small sense of achievement of \"getting closer to the graduation ceremony again\", and a little unwilling of \"ah, being scolded again, we must think about what's wrong, absolutely not more than 100 times\".\nMiraculously, I didn't fill that form until the end of my internship. To be more precise, I was scolded only 37 times and graduated. I noticed that as time passed, I was scolded less and less. Not only that, I also got good grades in many internship subjects that I have never had before. I kept that unfilled form for a while. I think, since the space can't be used up, I'll stay as the quota of scolding in my life. After a long time, it hasn't been used up.\nProbably few people are as happy as me after being scolded.

{"id": "lACp65C8H3GqvtG3whNLqnKEufX5S3Jiw5ExZgGlXw0", "title": "From then on, it is difficult for poor families to produce proud children?", "body": "Some time ago, I read a long article of a senior hr of the bank, \"it is difficult for a poor family to have a noble son\", and I received several waves of children from intellectuals, rural small towns, businesses, and civil servant families. The conclusion is that it is difficult for a poor family to have a proud son.\nIn fact, I have always been interested in this issue. I often think about a person's performance in society after adulthood, that is, the relationship between the so-called success and his childhood, reading performance, and family birth. The growth and protection of minors has always been the focus of my attention.\nIt happened that during the summer vacation, my husband's nephews and nieces came to my home for 20 days. I was able to observe closely what kind of living state children from rural areas are today, and their characteristics under this state, as well as some specific differences with urban children. Of course, the observation from individuals, like the conclusion drawn from this, is inevitably not rigorous and subjective, Therefore, the following points are for reference only.\nMy husband's hometown is in a county in Shaoyang, Hunan Province. The location of his home is also in a village in a town in this county. It is an authentic rural area to the letter. The environment around his home is mainly less dense hills. In recent years, the \"village to village\" policy has basically made the village accessible to cement roads, and he lives relatively densely with his neighbors. It is not a deep mountain with a family of more than a dozen miles away from the town, The motorcycle will arrive in about 10 minutes. The husband's younger brother and his mother live together and grow a small amount of food and vegetables. The couple mainly work part-time. Both are not far from home, so fortunately, my husband and brother's two children are not the saddest left behind children. There is always a father or mother at home. The two children, aged 10 and 7, go to school nearby. Growing up so big, I haven't been far away or left my hometown. When we returned to our hometown two years ago, what we saw was that they basically had no after-school recreational activities, no extracurricular reading materials, basically no toys, no desks for homework and reading, and even no special water cups of their own. The only entertainment is television. This is their basic living condition. I think their current living situation can represent the life of rural children in this part of the belt.\nWhen they came home this time, my preliminary observation was that their physical development was slower than that of urban children. These two children were fairly good in their hometown, but their height and weight were still lower than the basic level of the city, and their hair was thin and yellow. In particular, the change of teeth is very late. The boy began to change his teeth at the age of nine, and the girl's teeth have not loosened at the age of seven, which is of course closely related to his daily diet. Basically, children in rural areas eat with adults after weaning, which is difficult to do alone. Moreover, because of labor, most of their diets are casual, and the status of malnutrition varies from region to region. On the issue of tooth replacement, some children in cities seem to be moving to the other extreme. Many children begin to change their teeth even before the age of 5, which is not unrelated to the consumption of food additives, ripening agents, off-season food and uneven family diet in cities. However, in terms of diet and nutrition, the average level of rural children is indeed behind the urban average level, and the degree varies from region to region.\nAnother obvious difference is the ability of language expression. Perhaps because the living environment is relatively closed, after-school activities are relatively monotonous, and there are few or no opportunities to play, play games, make friends and travel on different occasions, this difference is obvious in urban and rural children. A survey has shown that pre-school rural children have different abilities in cognition, expression The ability of communication and other aspects can only reach 60% or less of the average level of urban children. For preschool children, urban parents are busy with early childhood education and development. No matter whether these activities have opened wisdom or not, they have emboldened children and gained insight, which is more or less achieved. And the children in rural areas are basically in the life of eating, drinking and watching TV. It is difficult to avoid occlusion and monotony.\nThe third is the lack of etiquette. It may be because the living environment is relatively monotonous, parents and grandparents are busy working, which is not deliberately reflected in this aspect. The coverage of preschool education, that is, kindergartens, in rural areas is also quite limited. Even if there is, it also acts as a simple care, and there is not much educational content. \"Hello, sorry, thank you, respect the old and love the young, and so on. I seem to be a little lacking in basic etiquette. I sometimes feel overwhelmed when communicating with others for help, and my awareness of active communication and expression is relatively indifferent. This conclusion is based on the performance of the two children at home in the past 20 days. Of course, this is not drawn from the situation that the children are not familiar with when they first get home, but after getting familiar with them after 20 days of being really together with them Out. For example, when communicating with us and other children, my brother is only used to speaking his hometown dialect, not Mandarin that everyone can understand. However, my sister does better than my brother. Sometimes I realize that everyone can't understand her hometown dialect and will take the initiative to speak some Mandarin. Although it is not very standard, it can make everyone understand and the communication can continue. Of course, the ability and awareness of communication are also related to personal character, but I personally think it has something to do with the awareness and cultivation of parents. This is also a little consistent with the HR conclusion of the bank on the Internet. Children from intellectual families are more noble, children from small towns are more dull, and children from business families are born more eloquent and smooth. This so-called emotional intelligence and the ability to communicate with others are actually closely related to the atmosphere and cultivation of the family. In fact, this ability will be a very important quality after entering the society.\nFrom my observation at home, I saw that the biggest advantage of these two children is that they don't have to rush and scream repeatedly to eat. Naturally, in my hometown, adults are busy working and eat when it's time. Who has the extra energy to rush three times and invite four times. In addition, because the adults at home have limited energy and there are two children, they are not paid too much attention, and the children are not so delicate and thick when they bump. Compared with this pair of cousins, the daughter has obvious characteristics of being a little one-child. She likes to be spoiled, compares herself, and is used to being self-centered (maybe it's not irrelevant for urban families to pay too much attention to fine feeding). In addition, my experience is that the emotional experience and satisfaction of rural children are not very good. In addition to limited expression, these two children are not used to expressing their internal needs and emotions. I'm thinking, of course, it's related to the level of economic development. Parents are mainly running away from their belly and daily chores. How much energy do they have to pay attention to their children's emotions? These two children have not slept alone so far, not without conditions, but without emotional weaning. Their 10-year-old brother is still sleeping with his grandmother, and their 7-year-old sister is still sleeping with their parents. Because they are still children, they are afraid of the dark, and no one explains why it is dark and what they can do in the face of the dark. Children can only use their own stubborn way to resist the independent sleep arranged by adults. And the conflict between the two brothers and sisters is mostly expressed and resolved by body language. Maybe this aspect has not been guided to have similar events, and what channels can be used to solve it. In terms of children's emotions, I believe in the following sentence: only when you are full can you put down your chopsticks; Only when children are satisfied with their emotions and have enough sense of security can they bravely go out. This is reflected in external things. My observation is that children with better emotional satisfaction are more brave to try, and for new things, novelty and new friends.\nTo sum up, in terms of my personal observation, in addition to the above subtle differences, I think that compared with their parents, the era and environment in which they live make them lose the main advantages that their parents once had, mainly in the following points:\n\n1. Completely natural and natural childhood growth.\n   Although the current situation of rural life makes it unnecessary for them to start the so-called early education and even rush to study as early as urban children, their growth can not be as natural as their parents' generation. The popularity of television has made their generation's childhood grow up almost with television. The disconnection between TV programs and the real world, as well as the painless characteristics of television, have irresistible interference with children's temperament, spirituality and imagination. But their parents, their childhood can be called as the integration of pure nature and nature. Although they are very lack of materials, and have no toys and extracurricular books, their growth at that time can be said to be the closest to nature. At that time, the pollution was not so serious. In summer, I went down the river to fish and shrimp, looked at the starry sky, autumn and fields, winter and firewood piles, and in spring, I went up the mountain to collect mushrooms. Although the material was hard, it was full of fun of the original ecology. Natural play from nature is simple but virtually opens the mind. These experiences are beyond the experience of such a generation of rural children. Parents also have a headache that their children are addicted to TV, but perhaps because of energy, life experience and attention, they can't provide further beneficial entertainment for their children. They don't have an extra-curricular book or any sports equipment at home. How can they spend their spare time?\n2. Hard life is the training of mind and character\n   The material life of this generation of rural children and their parents' generation needs to be improved. At that time, their parents had many brothers and sisters, could not eat enough, and had to help their families do the agricultural work within their capabilities if they had a little strength. In the hottest season, the intensity of the rural double gun was not affordable for everyone. The extraordinary hard life exercised their physical strength and honed their minds, which may be their parents' precious wealth, But the rural children of this generation of wealth can no longer have it. Food and clothing have been solved. Who is willing to let the children suffer? Even under the condition that the material conditions in rural areas are still limited, children still breed the same problem that urban children do not know how to cherish and are picky.\n3. Polarization of educational resources and blocking of information.\n   In the early years, rural children achieved outstanding positions by virtue of their intelligence and diligence. But now, under the current situation of the industrialization of education and the serious polarization of the distribution of educational resources, many things fell behind at the beginning, and it is not so easy to get ahead by diligence alone. If the so-called comprehensive quality assessment is implemented, it can be said that it is even worse news for many rural children. The competition of scores alone has fallen behind because of the blocking of information. Judging from the college entrance examination in recent years, the declining trend of the proportion of poor students favored by famous schools is a clear proof. At the same time, in order to grow into a proud child, it is far from enough to rely on academic excellence. That's why there is a saying of \"fighting dad\" in society. And because of the current situation of difficult employment of college students in recent years, rural (non suburban rural areas) children can graduate from high school is a minority, most of them go out to work when they reach junior high school, and the proportion of girls who continue to study is lower. Although reading and studying well does not represent a happy life, it is not a good thing to enter the society too early at the age of education.\n   To sum up, it is indeed much more difficult for poor students, especially those in remote rural areas, to grow into the pride of heaven again.\n   How to love children? How can children become talents? Some things seem irrelevant, and sometimes some things are full of necessity. Love sometimes really blinds our eyes. Children may not be able to become successful through hardship, but they can't really grow and exercise without necessary hardship and necessary physical and mental experience.", "timestamp": 1657375797, "digest": "GlmiH7tPpzKpHUrAWTtndL_X30hD6y1IcJ-Si_prWec", "contributor": "0x76BC1458da85c2cd53051d9502943320be041f71"}

When a good opportunity comes, it seems that time, place and people come together. Therefore, we will sigh countless times that we have made a lot of efforts, only one chance is missing. We also envy or envy others who have good opportunities.\nIf you only focus on the outstanding success that everyone can see, the opportunity seems to be very limited - I've seen a book whose meaningful title has metaphorized this. The title of the book is \"there is only one first place\". Nowadays, the definition of eye-catching success is often very narrow, so there are few opportunities for success at the beginning: in the school, there are dozens of people in each class. Even if everyone works equally, there can only be one first place in the end; In institutions, from the grass-roots level to the top, the number is generally pyramid shaped. The higher you go, the fewer positions you will have. There are far more people looking forward to promotion than positions that can be promoted. In the crowded public space, few people can instantly get the attention of everyone... Why can't you go to people who have the same strength, quality and performance? You may boil it down to: I'm one chance away. Most of the time, we think that getting opportunities is related to people's background, beauty, and future events, but has nothing to do with all these, that is, being extremely lucky and favored by heaven.\nHowever, the opportunity itself implies accidental factors. Looking at the situation of others and myself, if I only see that he is lucky and gets the opportunity, but I am unlucky and miss the opportunity, or place my hope on an unpredictable opportunity, it will not be of much help to my own growth or success. Countless people have said similar words: it is the weak who only wait for opportunities and even complain about not waiting. The strong will take the initiative to create opportunities.\nBe able to actively create, no longer rely on unpredictable external conditions, not wait passively, nor complain irritably, but put your goals, choices, intentions, courage, enthusiasm, strength, and flexibility into it, interact with the people and environment around you, and win the opportunities you need in the change. When someone keeps doing this, while trying to find and create opportunities, he also tries to cultivate his internal skills and improve himself. You will gradually find that even if he fails twice, as long as he doesn't encounter too bad environment (such as natural and man-made disasters), such a person will succeed sooner or later. They don't need to rely on chance and lament their bad luck. For their increasing strength, it is inevitable that they will achieve something.\nWhen you expand your horizons and regard all conditions and opportunities that are conducive to achieving yourself, improving interpersonal relationships and improving the situation as opportunities, including those that fall from the sky and those that you actively strive for and create, there are many opportunities. At this time, it is worth noting that it is still a change of vision - under the same conditions, some people see opportunities, while others only see problems and obstacles. As an old story says: two salesmen who sell shoes go to the same virgin land respectively. A depressed man came back and reported that there was no chance, and people there didn't wear shoes. The other came back excitedly and reported that there were great opportunities for development! No one there has shoes!\nOf course, if the great opportunities seen by the latter really want to be realized, at least we need to find out who has the corresponding purchasing power or potential purchasing power. In addition, we need to be mentally prepared. It takes a little time to cultivate the market. In any case, having a good eye for discovering and capturing opportunities will make it easier to achieve success and happiness in the long run.\nGood vision includes clearly knowing where you are going. When your goal is clear, you can not only save time and do things consistent with your goal, but also have the opportunity to turn every experience into a ladder closer to your goal. What many people face is another confusion, not that they have no opportunities, but that they have many choices and can't recognize which is the real good opportunity.\nI heard the experience of an entrepreneur two years ago. That is a woman who has been successful and famous in her own field. When she was middle-aged, opportunities to cooperate with her poured in from all directions. After spending a lot of time trying to figure out which opportunities were good, one day she suddenly realized that it was important to know where she was going and what she really wanted.\nWhen you have a good enough vision, know what you want, and focus on the scope you can decide, choose and influence, don't worry about opportunities. All you need to do is live a healthy life, do what you love (whether it can be a job or always a hobby), get along well with family and friends, interact with them sincerely, learn to affirm the beauty and brilliance of yourself and others, discover, create and enjoy the pleasures of daily life... One day, the opportunity to knock on the door.\nIt can be said that every day is giving you a new opportunity to know yourself more, live yourself, learn to love more and more, and let yourself live in love.", "timestamp": 1657375854, "digest": "bh0zlr6-_t2kfl6x6NIF6zGtWypgt15vlu8CBj5noTQ", "contributor": "0x2688280050c457dBAF2218d5B093A47769879787"}

In the face of these disputes and accusations, Guo Degang said frankly, \"what is success? Success is being good at paving the thrown bricks into the road.\"\nIndeed, in life, if you want to do something famous, if you want to succeed and stand out, it is almost impossible to be free from criticism and bricks. Those people with weak will may be knocked down by flying bricks, and they can't get up. This is what Lu Xun said about being \"beaten\". And people with strong will will bravely face criticism and accusations, make changes if there is one, and encourage if there is none, draw nourishment from criticism, and see their shortcomings from accusations. Of course, they will laugh off those malicious personal attacks and groundless rumors.\nIn a word, Lu Xun was the one who was thrown the most bricks among modern Chinese intellectuals. There were not only good-natured criticism and discussion, but also malicious criticism and slander. There were both contending opinions from cultural celebrities and shameless rumors from cultural hooligans. For example, he took the ruble of the Soviet Union government, for example, his works \"copied\" Japanese writers, etc. the handsome Lu Xun not only used these bricks to pave his way forward, And these bricks have become a towering cultural peak, which has not been matched by anyone so far.\nLittle giant Yao Ming is an admirer of Lu Xun, and his growth has also suffered a lot. When he first entered the NBA, the American media ridiculed, questioned and criticized him, which was overwhelming, and there were many bricks like rain. In the face of bricks, Yao Ming showed the wisdom and stubbornness of Oriental people. He didn't argue and didn't fight back with bricks, because he knew it was useless, and it was best to speak with facts. Didn't you laugh at me for being thin, so I worked hard to become a \"muscle man\"; Don't you satirize me that my playing style is too soft? I try my best to express myself in hard and evil battles; You're not attacking me. I can't score 20 points in a game anyway. I'll show you how I can get 30 or 40 points in a game. Yao Ming also paved his way to success with these bricks and became an NBA superstar.\n\"Grassroots\" actor Wang Baoqiang has poor personal conditions. In his own words, \"I'm short, average looking and have bad skin. I'm good for nothing except playing tricks.\" Many people are not optimistic about his acting career, constantly throwing cold water and bricks at him. In the eyes of his workmates, he is a paranoid person. I don't know how many people give him cold wind, satirize him, say that he is not this material at all, say that he is a toad who wants to eat swan meat, and ask him to look in the mirror to see what he looks like. If someone else received so many bricks, I'm afraid he would have been discouraged and gave up completely, but Wang Baoqiang didn't. every time he got a brick, he stubbornly rebounded: \"the more you say I can't, the more I want to show you. I firmly believe that I'm different.\" In this way, he \"didn't give up, didn't give up\", stubbornly looked for opportunities, and didn't give up no matter how small the role was. No matter how ordinary the role of mass actor was, he played seriously, first \"blind well\", then \"no thief in the world\", and then \"soldiers' assault\". One performed better than the other, and finally stood out, paving his own star road with these bricks.\n\"Success is to pave the way with bricks\", which is very philosophical and more feasible. Guo Degang and Yao Ming can do it, and you and I can do it. It's better to retreat and net when you envy fish.

This problem baffles many people. We have lived so long without knowing who we are?\n2、 What do I like to do? Maybe you've been busy, but please stop a little and listen to your inner voice. What do I like to do?\nJinn's answer: the ultimate satisfaction of life is to do what you like to do, and be recognized by everyone, and make achievements in this regard. To achieve this process, you may need to pay attention to:\n\n1. Solve the problem of food and clothing. That is to say, in the process of looking for something you like, the premise must be to ensure normal life. If you really feel that you have found something you like, you are very excited and want to do it immediately. Hold it. Consider that giving up your current job can maintain the economy for several months. Don't be tragic.\n2. There can be many things you like (suitable for). Maybe the accumulation of previous experience is not what you like to do, but if your current work is already handy, there is no need to change, and take other favorite things as hobbies.\n3. The process of judging whether you like it is: try. Is it easy to get started? Are there any innovative ideas to realize and improve? Are there any obstacles? Do you still have a strong interest in solving and understanding one by one? Accumulated to a certain extent, no one has recognized (can't make money), are you still interested? Be consistent and tireless, and your persistence has been recognized by everyone. Your efforts have also been recognized. Yes, this is what you like and suitable for.\n4. Life is very interesting, often encounter depressing things, the process feedback is confused, and there are only two results - regret or satisfaction. Persistence is satisfaction. No matter whether it succeeds as expected, it will point out the direction for future work. If you don't insist enough, you will regret and have a negative effect on your future work.\n   Finally, I would like to give you a sentence: some things, not that you don't like it, but that you may clearly like it, but you can't do it well, which leads to you wanting to avoid it, tolerate your weakness, and shamelessly tell yourself that it's not suitable for this and that.", "timestamp": 1657375966, "digest": "LEZhKoUuVfyhngRpl0bWoZD5La02SfCtSWoe8m7WQcE", "contributor": "0x1EcA182Df5Ab60b2905641d159a4882C5F3a3E69"}

I don't want to accept suffering, and suffering often surrounds us in real life. There is always nowhere to hide. Must be correct and right. So how will we face suffering? This reminds me of the life experience of John Aton, a world-famous car dealer.\nJohn Aton was born in a remote town. His parents died early, and his sister raised him with the money she earned from washing clothes. After his sister got married, his brother-in-law kicked him out of the house. He had to live in his uncle's house, but his aunt was even more mean. When he was studying, he stipulated that he could only eat one meal a day and clean up the stables and lawn. When he first worked, he was an apprentice, and his salary was so low that he couldn't afford to rent a house. At that time, he spent nearly a year sleeping in the abandoned warehouse in the suburbs.\nChurchill, the British Prime Minister, was a later friend of John Aton. In a conversation, Churchill was surprised to ask: why haven't you talked about those misfortunes and tribulations before?\nJohn Aton said with a smile: what's funny? People who are suffering or getting rid of suffering have no right to complain.\nChurchill looked at him puzzled.\nJohn Aton said: there is a condition for suffering to become wealth. This condition is that you should overcome suffering and no longer suffer. Only then, suffering is your proud wealth. When others listen to your suffering experience, they don't think you are reading the bitter Sutra, but they will think you are strong willed and worthy of respect. If you are still suffering and haven't got rid of it, what do you say? To others, it is undoubtedly asking for cheap mercy, or even begging... At this time, can you say that you have enjoyed suffering, exercised your quality in suffering, and learned to be patient? Others will only feel that you are playing with spiritual victory and comforting yourself.\nI think this is the experience of great people, and it can be seen everywhere in life.\nI have a friend. He comes from the Northern Wilderness countryside in the northernmost part of the motherland. He has many brothers and sisters, ranking the smallest in his family. Brothers and sisters have married and married one after another, leaving him alone. After the parents arranged the marriage for his little brother, they had no savings at all. In order to get married to his brother, his parents even sold food rations for dinner at home. But after they got married, their brothers and sisters only cared about their own little days. Not only unwilling to help their parents get rid of poverty, but also regarded him as a burden and didn't want to talk to him. He has reached the age of marriage, but he doesn't even have a girlfriend. Because of the poor economic conditions in his family, his marriage became a problem.\nHis parents saw that he was not young, and they were extremely anxious. Originally, the Northern Wilderness is vast and sparsely populated. It is not easy for young men and women to find a partner. The family with good economic conditions is OK, and the bad is even more difficult.\nA girl took a fancy to him, thought he was good and had ideals, and wanted to establish a love relationship with him. But the woman's parents and family all disagreed and strongly opposed. The reason for their opposition is: his family is poor and there is no help. How can he live in the past? But this girl has eyes and doesn't listen to her family. On the one hand, she did the ideological work of her family, on the other hand, she secretly continued to contact with the young man, and she also looked for countermeasures with the young man.\nThe young man knew that if he wanted the woman's family to accept him, he must first get rid of the tail of poverty. If poverty can be changed, any resistance will be easily solved. But how can we get rich in the Northern Wilderness countryside, which depends on heaven? After thinking about it, he decided to leave the northern wilderness, away from the days when his face turned to the black earth and his back turned to the sky, and go to work in large coastal cities in the south. He thought again, I don't know how long I can come back after this walk. Can the girl wait for him to return?\nThe girl listened to him finish his thoughts and asked only one sentence: will you live up to me?\nThe young man simply replied: definitely not!\nThe night is so quiet, the stars in the sky are twinkling, and two young hearts are beating wildly.\nThe young man asked: can you wait for me to come back?\nThe girl answered firmly: I'll work with you. I'll follow you wherever you go. I'm not afraid of the ends of the earth.\nThe young man was moved and took the girl in his arms. This is their first hug since they met. Time waits for no one, just leave. They went on a long journey together without telling their families.\nThey are the first local young people to go abroad to work.\nAfter they came to the coastal city of Qingdao, they called their families to reassure them that they didn't have to worry. What they didn't expect was that they didn't get understanding, but were mercilessly blamed by their families. As soon as the two young people were angry, they never contacted their families again.\nAlthough Qingdao is a coastal city with developed economy and more opportunities to earn money, money does not fall from the sky. They have neither skills nor academic qualifications, so they can only work as front-line workers in factories. When a girl goes to work in a clothing factory, the young man first goes to the construction site to work hard. They have changed a lot of jobs and are constantly looking for opportunities for development. Finally, the young man found a job as a salesman in a trading company. He is hardworking and has a flexible mind, from salesman to sales director. Then he opened his own company.\nThe girl quit her job in the clothing factory and became a landlady. She manages money. The young man is in charge of business, and the business is doing well. At this time, they realized that they had not contacted their families for many years, thinking that they should contact their families and tell their relatives thousands of miles away the joy of success.\nThe family didn't believe that the young man would be so rich, let alone that he could succeed. They also thought that he had nothing, and their tone was very cold. The young man wants to prove that he didn't lie. Let his family come to Qingdao to have a look. Instead, his family asked him for the round-trip fare. In order to be filial, the young man let his parents come.\nWhen parents came to Qingdao, their eyes lit up. They never thought that their son would develop so well with his own company and such a large building. The old man thought how could his son be so rich? After returning to the northern wilderness from Qingdao, the old man told his relatives and friends what he had seen and heard, and everyone was surprised.\nThe young man's brothers and sisters immediately changed their attitudes and said to everyone: my brother has opened his own company in Qingdao... They are going to send their children to Qingdao again. They said that Qingdao is an open coastal city, with a large city and a good environment. The space for children's development is much larger than the northern wilderness.\nThe young man's wife, sister and brother have sent their children to Qingdao one after another. The young man also tolerated the younger generation who had not been in touch for many years. This eased the tension between relatives.\nAt this time, the girl's family thought that the young man and the girl had not officially gone through the marriage formalities. Hurry to make arrangements for their make-up wedding.\nThis is a late wedding, after suffering and overcoming suffering.\nThe friend later said to me with emotion: if I farm in the rural areas of my hometown in Northeast China, no relatives will come and go. If we have contacts, we will not be so harmonious. Only self-improvement can do.\nMy friend's success in getting out of trouble has changed not only his own life, but also the life of his family. It even affects the growth of the next generation. Can this not be respected by relatives?\nPeople who want to succeed only turn suffering into a driving force for success and change suffering. Suffering is not terrible. What is terrible is that we lack the courage to make progress in the face of suffering. It's no use sighing. It's right to try to change suffering.", "timestamp": 1657376174, "digest": "u5LN0lpt54cizhY04M8zKMFsPEm_DU1KnTj2uNRIKeY", "contributor": "0xDd99eC19EC0fc81f732c7179C992678295504f64"}

It's also a virtue to silently do their own work and be willing to live at the bottom and middle of the pyramid.\nIt seems natural for clumsy birds to fly first - diligence can make up for clumsiness. But when I think about it carefully, it's not true.\nThe bird that flies first, if it is a lonely goose that leaves the group, the ancients are not seen before, and the comers are not seen after. Only loneliness and loneliness accompany them, and few people do not lose their way. The so-called chirping is to ask for the sound of friends. That sound of friends is the challenge on the journey of life and the consolation in a lonely life.\nMoreover, if the direction is unclear, it will only be the opposite; If the wings are not hard, they will give up halfway; If you come out too early, you will eventually become the target of public criticism.\nTherefore, flying first may not be good, and flying later may not be bad. The key is to find your own position.\nJiang Ziya's beard was gray, so he waited for King Wen of Zhou on the Bank of the Wei River; At the age of 27, Su Laoquan began to be angry about studying in private; Qi Baishi was born as a carpenter and became a great master in his declining years. Only when you find your own position, you can start later and arrive first; If you lose your way, you must be too quick to reach.\nStupid birds fly backward, which is convenient to observe, learn and learn from the advanced experience of others, rather than acting rashly. Only through comparison can people find their own strengths and weaknesses; Only with learning can people mend their shortcomings and loopholes; Only by looking beyond it, can people recognize the true face of Lushan Mountain and the truth behind it. Zhugeliang refused to go out of the mountain because he was lying high in the middle of the mountain. He was observing the general situation of the world and waiting to move. The so-called tranquility is to go far.\nStupid birds fly backward, which is also a respect for the rules. On the car track, no rush is allowed; On the football grass, offside is not allowed, playing with fire in front of the rules will only be sent off the field. If you want to participate in international affairs, you must abide by the rules of the game and have the gentleman spirit of \"feierplain\". Under the common rules, if you want to stay behind, you must stimulate your infinite potential.\nDaring to admit that you are stupid and not being smart is actually a wise move.\nIn life, it's impossible for everyone to be the first, admit the gap, don't envy, envy, hate, and don't feel sorry for themselves. It's also a virtue to silently do their own work and be willing to live at the bottom and middle of the pyramid. The scenery is not only at the top of the mountain, but also at the foot of the mountain, between the mountains and along the hillside.\nSince the sky is high enough for birds to fly, you might as well be a stupid bird. Always remember: if you don't fly, you will fly to the sky.\nFly later, fly slowly. If you practice hard wings, avoid storms, find shortcuts, and have lofty aspirations, you will have a bright future.

{"id": "bBeXd7WQ-KeChKRFxU07h6axv3P86lse_on6Uj-wE1Q", "title": "Some useful habits", "body": "1. Long term tasks should be started as soon as possible\n   Generally speaking, long-term tasks are always annoying and difficult, and people always tend to avoid difficulties. The final result is either to give up at last, or to rush to work with a little time left; I also learned this lesson before. I deceived myself and others by saying \"live a relaxed life and put aside annoyance\". I was in a hurry to deal with it in the last few days, which made me feel embarrassed.\n   Later, I found that this practice is actually counterproductive. If you adjust your mental state and understand the situation as soon as possible, it does not necessarily bring psychological pressure. On the contrary, because you have plenty of time, you are confident to grasp the progress. Even if you encounter sudden problems in the middle, you still have time to solve them; More importantly, starting as soon as possible can make full use of the time of leftover materials: for example, if I receive a document and need to give comments in three days, I will browse it roughly on the same day. In the next three days, I will be able to think in spare time such as taking a car, walking, etc., and the effect is good. If I don't understand it as soon as possible, these time will be wasted, He didn't do anything meaningful (Archimedes couldn't think of a way to detect the authenticity of the crown if he hadn't been in the bath for 10000 years).\n   The same is true of e-mail. I often see people discussing whether it is better to reply to e-mail immediately or later. My experience is that after receiving e-mail, you should read it as soon as possible, at least understand what is said in the e-mail. If you are not in a hurry, you can reply after thinking clearly.\n2. Always think about what you are doing\n   Generally speaking, the work we do always has a purpose and significance, but the form of work is very specific. When we are busy, we often get into a dead end, forget the real purpose and significance, and \"can't think clearly\" what we really want to do. A few days ago, I needed to build a demonstration environment. I had two schemes a and B. scheme a was estimated to take half an hour, and scheme B was estimated to take an hour. So I chose scheme a, but after I started, I found that the server lacked a necessary component, so I struggled to add this component first, and then compiled the software I needed. I also found that there would be compilation errors in the 64 bit environment (I had only compiled on 32-bit machines before), After checking the Internet, I found that a patch was needed, so I went around looking for this patch... At this time, it has been used for more than an hour, and I don't know how many problems there will be below; It suddenly occurred to me that what I really wanted to do was to demonstrate the program. Although it was interesting to solve problems such as patching and finding software, it was actually a waste of time from the perspective of the task, so I decided to choose scheme B, and it was successfully solved in an hour.\n   According to my observation, many technicians are keen to solve pure technical problems, which Weinberg calls \"hacking\"; Wandering is fun and addictive, but we are not gods who don't eat human fireworks. If we want to really do something, we can't let wandering go.\n   On this one, I want to add one more point: even if you are busy in the dark, you can't lose your head. It is common for people to work under great pressure and get too busy. Many people lose their direction in this kind of busy. They are often busy all day and don't know what they have done today and what the meaning is after work. My experience is that the more this kind of time, the more you need to cheer up and think (although it's difficult): what exactly do you want to do, and whether the current arrangement can be adjusted... Continuous thinking will produce feelings and make a difference, otherwise, you may always fall into the situation of \"fooling around\" and can't extricate yourself.\n3. Set a clear time point for yourself\n   I admit that I also like playing. It's really interesting to go to twitter, watch forums and chat when I'm free. The information is constantly updated, and something I'm interested in always pops up. But in this way, a lot of time is wasted in front of the computer, and I don't do anything meaningful. Even if I do it, the efficiency is very low - concentration can ensure efficiency. After exploring and reflecting, I think it is more appropriate to set a clear time point for myself: for example, now at 8:20, I can tell myself to play online for 20 minutes and start learning English at 8:40. Because I have a clear time limit, I will want to read all the contents I am interested in as efficiently as possible within these 20 minutes, instead of slowly \"browsing\"; At the set time point, we must obey orders and prohibitions, and concentrate on what we have decided before.\n   More importantly, setting a clear time point for yourself from small things is very good for cultivating executive ability - if many small things can be \"done as you say\", slowly, complex and larger tasks can also be \"done as you say\", with inertia and confidence.\n   4、. keep a diary\n   A more formal website has a detailed access log (record). Even without data mining, once there is an abnormal fluctuation in the website access, it will be reflected in the log, and the problem can be found by checking the log; Websites are like this, so are people. I began to keep a diary every day since I translated Weinberg's \"the road to technical leadership\" in 2008. I found that the diary has the same function as the access log of the website: for example, I usually arrive at the company at about 8:35, with an error of no more than 5 minutes. But I checked my diary at about 9:00 a few days last week, and I can find out this change, and the reason for the change - the order of doing things in the morning has changed. Moreover, according to my diary, I can also observe and evaluate the impact of this change, whether it is good or bad.\n   Diary can also constantly remind and urge myself. For a period of time, I found myself often in a state of having nothing to do. If I didn't have a diary, I mostly felt that \"I always had nothing to do during this period\", but the diary would write \"today is the eighth day I feel I have nothing to do\". In this way, the pressure on myself would be much greater and the motivation would be much stronger.\n   I need to say more about diaries. I never understood why diaries are so simple for people who have kept diaries for many years? Only record what you did on that day, with a little simple comment, but not too much Lyric. I have kept a diary for more than a year since I translated the road to technical leadership. I gradually understand that continuous diary needs to record the main behaviors of the day, plus a little comment and reflection. Diary is not suitable as a carrier of lyricism. Its more suitable function is to truly record the traces of life for analysis and reflection, and then it is possible to improve itself.\n4. Cultivate foresight\n   The old saying \"everything is established in advance, and abandoned without advance\" is quite right. Take software projects for example. Although it is difficult to predict the development time of the project, experienced technicians can often make more accurate judgments. This is because they have the ability to foresee the problems that will be encountered in the development. In this way, the arrangement is more abundant in time (which can ensure efficiency) and more prepared psychologically.\n   On the other hand, I have seen with my own eyes that many technicians, who just complete the task at this stage at hand, will be fine. They never foresee these problems: how much scale and pressure their programs can load, what problems will occur beyond this load capacity, how to solve them, and how long will this problem occur at the current development rate... The result is that when the problem really occurs, In a hurry, \"iterative development\" has become \"demolition development\" -- at a certain point in time, it will be torn down and start over again. The quality can't be guaranteed. If you don't say it, you're too tired to speak of it.\n   There is a famous book in the software industry called refactoring. The core idea of this book is that software needs to be refactored constantly, or it will become rigid. If it is only satisfied that there is no problem at present, there is no way to talk about continuous refactoring.\n5. Establish an overall view\n   A friend discussed job hopping with me the other day. Now there are two choices, which are difficult to decide; After listening to his detailed description, I said, well, you don't look at salary and position for the time being. You think like this: what kind of person and life state do you want to be in ten or five years? Take this answer to measure your current two choices and see what happens. As a result, he made a happy decision later. I think this is the role of the overall view.\n   I will also encounter many trade-offs and choices. For example, I always feel that my foundation on computer is not solid enough, my English is not good enough, I read too few books, and my photos are not good enough... So I want to go to cram school foundation, learn English, read books, and see the photos of masters... Doing any of them will give people a sense of achievement, but people's time and energy are limited, and it is impossible to give consideration to both; In many times when I need to make a choice, I will try to get rid of the limitations of a book, a knowledge, and a thing, jump out and think about what kind of state I am in, what is the important task, and what kind of person I want to be in the future... Only when I know the most urgent needs can I make a leisurely choice, even if I give up some good opportunities - besides, as teacher Li Xiaolai said, Temptations often appear disguised as opportunities. With the magic mirror of the overall situation, many temptations will show their true shape.\n   The overall view is useful not only for personal growth, but also for work: no matter how small and trivial the things at hand, thinking can always jump out of the limitations of work and try to look at what you do from a broader perspective, what is the value of what you do and how to improve it; In this way, I can do my work better and cooperate with my colleagues more tacitly.\n6. Observe carefully in life\n   I go shopping at Metro every weekend. In the first few weeks, I choose different time points: 8 a.m., 11 a.m., 1 p.m., 4 p.m.. In this way, I can roughly know when shopping is the most time-saving. It is difficult to judge this accurately just by thinking, because there may be more checkout windows when there are many people, and fewer checkout windows when there are few people. With this understanding, we can make proper arrangements to minimize the time in line when shopping. In addition, you can also know the situation of the parking lot at different times. In rainy days, you can also choose the appropriate time to go shopping and park the car in a sheltered parking space.\n   For another example, there is more than one road from home to the company. At the beginning, I will try every road to see whether it is congested, flat, and how long it will take; In this way, you can quickly choose the most appropriate path in various situations; If you only go one way or don't pay attention to observation, you won't understand these situations, and you won't have so many choices when you encounter situations.\n7. Cultivate a sense of discretion\n   In addition to qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis is also useful, and quantitative analysis is often more meaningful - there are too few problems of either this or that, black or white in the world. Unfortunately, many times we unconsciously look at the world with qualitative thinking, and often lose a lot of opportunities.\n   For example, a biography \"strange life\" is mentioned in \"taking time as a friend\". The author describes in detail the practice of Soviet scientist lyubyshev in managing time - lyubyshev's grasp of time every day can be accurate to minutes, and he carefully records how much time he spends doing every day: Writing for 35 minutes, reading for 50 minutes... Although \"accurate as a clock\", the biographer also admits, The life that he thought was \"still full\" was really much worse than that of lyubichev. I feel deeply about reading \"strange life\", and I also know that although I can't be as precise as Liu bishev, I can at least learn some tricks secretly to make my life more organized and efficient. But when I recommended it to some friends, my first reaction was: life is so precise that it has become a robot. How terrible! The subtext is that I don't want to understand at all. But what I want to say is that a serious understanding of lyubichev's life does not require us to be as extreme as he is, but only to provide an opportunity to learn from other people's experience and living habits (if we don't know, we can't even learn from them). As for the degree of learning, this measure can and needs to be grasped by ourselves.\n   I deeply believe that a sense of discretion is very important. It allows us to look at all situations calmly: when we see bad things, remind ourselves to keep a distance, when we see good things, tell ourselves to try to learn from them, at least not to be widened. Only in this way can we face life calmly and find our own coordinates. In the words of Karl Popper, the scientific philosopher I like, our good self-feeling must be based on comparison and judgment - the more we understand the world, the more we see, the more we know (of course, the more we grasp, the more we exercise self-restraint), the more \"good\" this feeling really is (the \"good\" that closes the door and stays self-contained is actually very fragile and gloomy). The philosopher Wittgenstein said before his death, \"how happy I am, I have spent a good life.\". He said that sentence with confidence.", "timestamp": 1657376411, "digest": "5W7QjgnR3HOe0UJBHTQrV6QYIxhYo7YDTi7oTAAbdcY", "contributor": "0x4D2DAbCc51f3C63f30cc631e7DA86AeF7A60116C"}
{"id": "hudxMEjHThQ4m5LQio90EjJK2lk1OBG25Q43RqJPGJY", "title": "What are the main factors that make people great", "body": "History will only remember those who really push the wheel of history forward, and the people will only remember those who are dedicated to the happiness of the people forever. Only those who always think of the people, the people will always think of him. Nobility lies in selflessness, and greatness lies in dedication—— Great men are those who wholeheartedly seek the welfare of the people, make great contributions to human society, and promote the wheel of history. People love to read biographies of great people in order to know the main factors that make people great. So, what are they?\n\\[particularly noble moral character\\] a person's moral character determines his life purpose, life ideal, life attitude, that is to say, determines a person's outlook on life. Outlook on life refers to the fundamental views and attitudes of people living in certain social conditions and environments on the purpose, value and significance of life based on a certain worldview and practical experience of social life. Why are you alive? What kind of person do you want to be? How can life be meaningful? What kind of life is a happy life? These questions are about the outlook on life. The outlook on life of people with particularly noble morality must be like this - people live to work hard for the people and make more contributions to human society. Only in this way can they live the most meaningful and happy life.\nThe building should be high, the foundation should be deep, and the person should be strong and virtuous. Great men must have great virtue first. What great people do is not something that ordinary people can't do, but often unwilling to do, or not unable to do for a while, but unwilling to do for a long time. For example, what Lei Feng did is not an earth shattering event, but a trivial matter. It can be said that each of us can do those things, but most of us are unwilling to do them, or we are only willing to do them for a while, rather than doing them from time to time, every day, every month, and every year, and keep doing them. This shows that greatness does not depend on ability, but mainly on morality. If a person has a great ability, if this great ability is only used to \"do no harm to people and specialize in himself\", then, let alone not be a great man, it is not worthy to be an ordinary person, and even because of \"the opposite\", it will become a big cancer that endangers society.\nIt can be seen from the above discussion that only people with particularly noble morality will selflessly give their lives to the people and devote themselves to human society; Only those who are especially noble in morality can make great contributions to human society. The famous saying \"a master must be a man of great virtue\" is a brief explanation of the importance of morality in the cause of great men. Having a particularly noble moral character is the most important quality of a great man, and it is also the most important factor for a great man to become a great man.\n\\[particularly noble ideal\\] ideal refers to people's outlook and yearning for the future. It is the imagination and ambition that may be realized and related to the goal of life. Ideal is the flag of life; Ideal is the beacon of life; Ideal is the source of life strength.\nLofty ideals are decisive for a person to follow the right path of life and make great achievements. 1、 Because only by setting up lofty ideals, can we have a broad mind, not frown over trivial things in life, and not pursue fame and wealth endlessly. 2、 Because only those who have set lofty ideals and clear goals can have great spiritual motivation. With such motivation, they will have indomitable perseverance and iron will. No matter how tortuous the road is and how hard life is, they will not lose their way forward. Even under extremely difficult conditions, they are still full of vigorous fighting spirit and indomitable optimism, and do not shrink back even in the face of death threats.\nA great man must have great ambition first. Many great men set up particularly noble ideals in their youth. Marx set up the great ideal of \"seeking the welfare of all mankind\" in his youth; Madame Curie set up the great ideal of \"fighting for the prosperity and strength of the motherland\" in her youth; Mao Zedong set up the great ideal of \"transforming China and the world\" in his youth; Zhou Enlai set up the great ideal of \"fighting for the rise of China\" when he was studying in Nankai Middle School; Li Dazhao set up the great ideal of \"determined to work hard for the cause of national liberation\" in his youth.\n\\[particularly firm belief\\] belief, everyone has it, and different people have different beliefs,; Different beliefs will bring different lives. Faith refers to a psychological tendency that people extremely respect and believe in certain things, thoughts and doctrines, and regard them as the norms and guidelines for all their words and deeds, and even believe in them all their lives and pursue them persistently.\nFirm faith is very important to life. It is the spiritual pillar of life: first, it can make people have sustenance and expectations. 2、 It gives people confidence, courage and perseverance, and affects people's mental state. 3、 It can guide people to establish lofty ideals and goals. 4、 It can become a powerful driving force for a person to set a lofty goal without fear of difficulties, hardships, and even bloodshed. If a person has a firm belief, he can be loyal, put aside his personal hardships, honors and disgraces, and put aside his life and death.\nOne of the reasons why great men are great is that they have a particularly firm belief. As martyr Fang Zhimin said, \"the enemy can only cut off our heads and must not shake our faith! Because the doctrine we believe in is the truth of the universe.\" As Xia Minghan's martyrdom poem: \"beheading doesn't matter, as long as the doctrine is true. Kill Xia Minghan, and later people.\"\n\\[strong sense of responsibility\\] sense of responsibility is also called sense of responsibility. It is a positive emotion that a person wants to do well what he should undertake. What is the strict definition of responsibility? Responsibility is the responsibility and obligation of people to play different social roles in social survival and life. For example, in the family, parents have the responsibility to raise their children; In school, teachers have the responsibility of teaching and educating people; In society, citizens have the responsibility to promote social development; In the government, cadres have the responsibility of being good public servants of the people.\nThe responsibility of people is not to act if they want to, or not if they don't want to; It is not that if you want to do more, you will do more, and if you want to do less, you will do less. It should be done, it must be done. But the actual situation is really unsatisfactory. Many people have a weak sense of responsibility, or even a little sense of responsibility. For example, many children are not devoted to their parents; Many parents do not devote themselves to raising their children; Many students do not study hard; Many teachers do not devote themselves to teaching and educating people; Many citizens do not think about the development of society; Many cadres only think of their own interests.\nOne of the great reasons for great men is that they have a strong sense of responsibility, a strong sense of mission of the times and a strong sense of social responsibility. They not only did their duty well, but also did many extra duties. They care about the earth, mankind, the country and the people, and devote their lives and even lives to social progress, national prosperity and human civilization.\n\\[particularly high enthusiasm\\] enthusiasm is a strong, stable and deep emotional state. Enthusiasm is always associated with people's clear understanding and firm will. It affects people's whole body and mind, determines the basic direction of people's behavior, becomes a huge force to promote and encourage action, and is a necessary condition for the success of all undertakings.\nOne of the common characteristics of all great revolutionaries, scientists and artists is that they have a high degree of enthusiasm for the cause they are engaged in. It is this enthusiasm that encourages them to make outstanding contributions to mankind. For example, Dalton, the great chemist and father of chemistry, Newton, the great physicist and father of physics, Nobel, the great inventor and chemist, have no enthusiasm for love, which is \"more expensive\" than life, because of their extreme enthusiasm for science. They do not marry all their lives and are passionate about the cause of science. Another example is Edison's bridal chamber, where he did experiments after his wedding and left his wife to spend the night alone; Pavlov made an appointment with his fiancee for the holiday, but he didn't leave the laboratory until the clock struck twelve at night. From their \"ruthlessness\" towards their lovers, we can see how enthusiastic they are about the scientific research they are engaged in.\nLook at these famous words: Emerson said: the great deeds handed down in the world are the fruits of victory due to the enthusiasm of great men. Goethe said: the first and last thing that genius requires is the love of truth. Gorky said: Genius is developed due to the love of career. It can be said that genius is essentially just the love of career and work process. Disraeli said: every genius must be the product of enthusiasm—— How important passion is to be a great person!\n\\[particularly strong self-confidence\\] Zhuang Zi said: sorrow is no greater than death. Cheng Yi said: the biggest sin is to abandon oneself. Lu Jiuyuan said: life must be self respecting. Bacon said: despair begets disappointment, disappointment shakes vividly, and vacillation begets failure. Montaigne said: the most barbaric thing is to despise yourself. Hugo said: I would rather rely on my own strength to open up my future than seek the favor of the powerful; You should believe that you are the winner of life. From these famous sayings about self-confidence at all times and in all countries, we can see how important self-confidence is to people's success!\nSelf confidence makes people strong. Self confidence is the primary psychological quality that any person who does great things must have, and it is the decisive factor of a person's achievement. Only when you are firmly confident in the cause you are engaged in, will you have perseverance and perseverance, will you have the courage and determination to overcome all difficulties, and will you lose and fight repeatedly until you succeed.\nSelf confidence makes people diligent. It is said that genius comes from diligence, while I say that genius comes from self-confidence. Because self-confidence is the premise of diligence, and only very confident people will be diligent. Will those who think they can't do anything well and succeed work hard?\nSelf confidence makes people innovative. A great person has an obvious characteristic that he is bold to be first, has a strong sense of innovation and a great spirit of innovation. They have made great original contributions because of this spirit. However, strong innovation consciousness and great innovation spirit are based on strong self-confidence. Otherwise, they will be superstitious about others, despise themselves, and dare not adhere to the correct truth understanding and invention they initiated.\nConfidence makes people brave. Many people's lives are mediocre, often not incompetent, but fearless. Therefore, being fearless is because you are suspicious of your spirit, heart, knowledge, ability and so on, so you are afraid of wolves before and tigers after, content with the status quo, muddle along, and don't want to make progress.\nAccording to the above analysis, one of the reasons why great people are great is that they have extraordinary self-confidence. People who achieve great things can be mediocre in intelligence, but their self-confidence must be extraordinary.\n\\[great man and Superman\\] greatness lies in surpassing the thoughts, emotions, wills, ideals, interests, abilities and morality of ordinary people... Death is a hero, and transcendence is a hero. Only by being extraordinary can we become Superman. Similarly, great people are great because they are far beyond ordinary people in many aspects, especially in spiritual and psychological aspects: they can think of things that ordinary people can't think of; Can see what ordinary people can't see; Can hear what ordinary people can't hear; Can say what ordinary people can't say; Can do what ordinary people cannot do Of course, what we are talking about here is \"positive transcendence\", that is, transcendence in the direction beneficial to society.\n\\[great man and genius\\] genius lies not in the quality of life, but in the quality of the day after tomorrow. Everyone can become a genius, and everyone can also become a mediocre, which mainly depends on whether he has good psychological quality. Genius is the great change and optimization of the day after tomorrow. Interest creates success, love creates genius. Most people are ordinary in appearance, and whoever is beautiful is an immortal; Most people have the same intelligence. Whoever works hard is a genius. He who exalts himself becomes a genius, and he who exalts himself becomes a fool.\nGenius is not necessarily a great man, because genius mainly refers to the excellence of ability. Only those geniuses with excellent virtue and talent can be called great men.\nThere are many other factors that make people great, such as superhuman ability, superhuman perseverance, superhuman courage, super enterprising spirit and so on. However, they are not decisive factors, because their production and intensity are not only determined by the above-mentioned factors, but also by the direction and purpose of their role. Therefore, those major factors are the decisive factors and the main factors that make people great. Because those major factors are human spirit, we can briefly say that human greatness lies in the greatness of spirit.\nIf you are in line with ordinary people, you can only be ordinary people; Only by keeping up with great people can we become great people. Great people don't become great people in order to become great people. On the contrary, they just become great people in order to become \"candles that burn themselves, let out light and heat\". Great people are great mainly because of the greatness of spirit. May we all learn the great spirit of great men!", "timestamp": 1657376231, "digest": "-Nyy2KgAyCYBCuqplv3lJncYqDqkx6DtiUc49iEjR1s", "contributor": "0x78bEfa7dDB3D63c4414088d5c83968F96724B1Be"}

Indeed, in the current era of accelerating pace of life, if you don't make progress today, tomorrow you will redouble your efforts for today's retrogression.\nWe all say that learning is like sailing against the current. If you don't advance, you will fall back. This requires you to make gains and progress every day. Even if the progress is small, as long as you move forward, you will get a result. Because every moment, others are running forward. If you stop, you will be far behind by others. At that time, even if you try your best to catch up, I'm afraid it won't help.\nIt's not difficult to make progress in what you have today. As long as you are willing to devote a little time to enrich yourself every day, even if it's only an hour, your achievements will be amazing. However, in today's era of accelerated pace of life, it seems that people don't have enough time to finish what they want to do every day, so many good ideas can't be implemented. However, there are still many people who insist on squeezing out at least an hour every day to improve themselves, and finally have made great achievements.\nAt Harvard, professors often remind students to do a good job in time management, and cite the following examples:\nGlauford, President of DuPont, the world's largest chemical company? Greenwatt, squeeze out an hour every day to study hummingbirds and take photos of hummingbirds with special equipment. Authorities call his book on hummingbirds an outstanding work in the natural history series.\nHugh? Black had no higher education before entering the US Congress. From his busy schedule, he squeezed out an hour every day to the library of Congress to read widely, including books on politics, history, philosophy, poetry and other aspects. For several years, even in the busiest days of parliamentary work, he never stopped. Later, he became a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States. At this time, he was one of the most knowledgeable people in the Supreme Court.\nA Greek elevator repairman named Nikola is very interested in modern science. He always spends an hour studying nuclear physics after work and before dinner every day. As the accumulation of knowledge increased, an idea jumped into his mind. In 1948, he proposed a plan to build a new type of particle accelerator. This kind of accelerator was cheaper and more powerful than other types of accelerators at that time. He submitted the plan to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission for testing, and after further improvement, the accelerator saved the United States $70million. Nicholas received a $10000 reward and was hired to work in the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California.\nAt Harvard, students have such a consensus that every day they make little progress, which can not only give full play to their internal potential, but also accumulate capital for success. Indeed, if you don't work hard and always stand still, you won't achieve much in your life. Even if you are gifted, you will end up just a mediocre and do nothing. Harvard professors pay more attention to their continuous progress. Some Harvard professors have won the Nobel Prize, but they still study and work tirelessly. Some professors are over seventy years old and still insist on doing research in the laboratory. As a growing young person, there is no reason to stop yourself. I once saw such a story, which is very enlightening. Now let me share it with you.\nJohn and Tom are children of two neighboring families. They have been playing together since childhood. John is a smart boy. He can learn everything at a glance. He knows his advantages and is very proud of himself. Tom's brain is not as clever as John's. although he studies hard, he can't get ahead in grades. Therefore, compared with John, his heart often shows an inferiority complex.\nHowever, his mother always encouraged him: \"if you always measure yourself by the achievements of others, you will only be a 'chaser' all your life. Although the galloping horse always roars ahead at the beginning, it is often the camel full of patience and perseverance that finally arrives at the destination.\"\nIn this way, John no longer feels inferior for his shortcomings, but tries to make continuous progress.\nBut the smart John thinks he is a smart man and never wants to make progress. Therefore, his performance in his life was mediocre, and he failed to achieve any major event. But Tom, who felt very stupid, enriched himself in all aspects, surpassed himself a little bit, and finally achieved extraordinary achievements.\nJohn was so angry that he ended up depressed. After his soul flew to heaven, he asked God, \"my intelligence is far better than Tom. I should be greater than him, but why did you make him an outstanding person on earth?\" God smiled and said: \"Poor John, you didn't understand until you died: when I sent everyone to the world, I put the same thing in the 'girdle' of his life, but I put your intelligence in front of the 'girdle'. You were so happy because you saw or touched your intelligence that you missed your life. But Tom's intelligence was behind the 'girdle'. Because he couldn't see his intelligence, he was always looking up In front of him, so he has been unconsciously moving forward all his life! \"\nIn fact, it is true that on the road of life, you stop, but someone is rushing desperately. Maybe when you stand, he is still chasing after you, but when you look back, you can't see his figure, because he has run in front of you, and now you need to catch up with him. Therefore, you can't stop. You have to keep moving forward and surpassing. The result of this is to make continuous progress and finally achieve the other side of victory.\nPeople who invest in the future are loyal to reality.\n——Invest for future and be loyal to reality.\n\"Investment\" is a very popular word at present. Everything you have in the future needs today's investment. As long as you have a little vision, you will think of investing for your tomorrow.\nAs a world-renowned university, Harvard emphasizes the need to have a long-term vision and invest in the future. Summers, the 27th president of Harvard, believes that the reason why Harvard can achieve today's results is inseparable from its long-term educational vision. It not only attaches importance to the current popular and popular disciplines, but also pays attention to the future development trend and prospects of a discipline. It is based on this idea that they put forward such a statement: people who invest in the future are loyal to reality.\nWe say that people should be loyal to reality, but those who are loyal to reality should have a long-term vision, because the reality is constantly developing, we should not only focus on the gains and losses of immediate interests, but also focus on the future and carefully plan for future development. Only in this way can we calmly welcome the future.\nBefore August, 1995, domain names were registered free of charge. In that year, Tim Lee registered a domain name cool dot com for himself. At that time, he was a fourth grader at the University of Washington.\nThis practice was laughed at by friends, who didn't understand the use of Tim for a domain name. At that time, Tim just wanted to earn enough money to pay tuition and rent. He almost sold it for less than 10000 dollars.\nBy 1996, Tim received an average of two calls a week to buy the domain name cool dot com, including an airline. But he didn't promise anyone. Finally, through a lawyer in New York, Tim transferred the domain name cool dot com to a famous consumer goods manufacturer with $3million in cash.\nAt that time, many people laughed at the company: seven letters plus a dot and eight symbols. It's crazy to spend so much money. But later, the company raised the price of this domain name to $38million", "timestamp": 1657376288, "digest": "shTFnubG_Z744LhOuqlAoFNA0f563xqPRafeY2t3mu4", "contributor": "0x49301A4FbCe4e2a9C75d446664Fcb0e811b89223"}
{"id": "r_fIF2U7KPkrwuvJW9wJo_taPiHBnpfxlxQ1joOfwck", "title": "It's better to concentrate on one's skill than to be confused", "body": "At present, many young people are confused - some are confused about college education: they feel that what they have learned is useless, \"Newton equation\" can not bring jobs and houses; There is confusion about social morality: avoiding loftiness and doubting tradition, while longing for a good moral trend in society; There is confusion about love: very eager for love, but unable to deal with love problems; There is confusion about the future: the lack of faith and the pressure of entrepreneurship and employment make many young people confused about the future. This confusion has something to do with China, which is in economic adolescence, and the era background of rapid growth and emotional fluctuations.\nHow can young people get out of this confusion and find their spiritual belonging? Strengthening skills may be a way out, that is, like a laser, focus on one point, focus on things and things, and practice repeatedly. There are many kinds of skills: production, marketing, service, administration, finance, research and development, art... Each professional post corresponds to a professional skill, but only the skills that can compete with people in the market are \"effective skills\".\nSkills are also an important link, through which you can make friends with relevant majors, have a common language, and can improve each other. Friends with good mental state and positive energy will bring happiness and inspiration to themselves.\nOnly by strengthening skills can we be happy. When you devote yourself to studying a skill, you will have a direction in your heart and a place for your energy. Concentration makes you quiet and down-to-earth. The improvement of skills is also accompanied by the joy of growth and inner happiness. The spiritual outlook will be completely different after the great increase of passion and energy.\nTo strengthen your skills, you need to focus. The popularity of iPad and iPhone stems from its distinctive appearance, humanized operation, multi touch technology, etc. behind it is the perfection of every skill, the ultimate pursuit of consumer experience, and the perfect crystallization of highly focused skills.\nOf course, to strengthen your skills, you need to constantly learn relevant books, make relevant friends, and strengthen your majors and preferences.\nCollege students who have just started working often pay attention to the \"big things\" considered by leaders and even superiors, and are unwilling to do small things and go deep into them. My suggestion is to do big things like lifting heavy weights, small things like walking on thin ice, and to do one line of work, love one line of work, and concentrate on one line of work.\nAt present, many people in the society are not working for skill improvement, but just for making money. This is actually because the sense of professional honor is weakening and utilitarian thoughts are growing, which will eventually lead to spiritual desolation and spiritual emptiness, and from the most practical point of view, making less money. It is imperative to strengthen the sense of professional honor. Only by strengthening skills can young people find spiritual belonging. Only those who regard work as art and creation can realize the release of potential and finally achieve themselves.\nIn fact, the confusion of youth is not unique to China. In the era of rapid economic development and rapid cultural change, the youth of many countries have encountered this confusion. For example, the European and American youth in the 1960s have also been collectively confused and explored - where is the spiritual destination? Hippies, sexual liberation and other movements were once a solution, but in the end they didn't work.\nHowever, a generation of young people represented by Germany and Switzerland finally walked out of confusion. The method is very simple, that is, concentrate on studying a skill, be meticulous, keep improving, and pursue the perfection and perfection of the skill. Even a small workshop is exquisite; Even a family inherited brand pursues refinement and personalization.\nThe value of strengthening skills is a sense of professional honor. In a good society, as long as you do your job almost perfectly, you will be fully respected, and you can experience professional honor and happiness. Pursuing the best skills can not only pursue your spirit, but also create value and contribute to the society. While meeting material needs, it can change impetuousness and shortsightedness. After the skills of the whole people are improved, they must improve their ability to innovate and promote change and invention.", "timestamp": 1657376353, "digest": "rlJJVIF7QtgiokJa2HXifvM90LxJ23Aw_hwM0uelwOc", "contributor": "0xc77b1448D157f25Bf9699BEE477cdF16cf9744b3"}

{"id": "Yv0or3YP1xG39TXB2FPB_T78Lwa8gXajajIX--W4haQ", "title": "Make good use of prime time: the first hour of every day", "body": "In primary and junior high schools in the United States, there will be a place called the home room, where students must call the roll or listen to the notice before class every day. So students will have a period of time at the beginning of each day to think about their schedule, catch up with friends, or knock out a few tasks. Many successful people will arrange a home room time at the beginning of each day in their own schedule.\nFor Craig Newmark of Craigslist, David Karp of Tumblr, Tony Robbins, a master speaker, and brain Tracy, a professional writer, the first hour of each day may be a little different. Here is the first item on their daily task list:\n\n1. Don't check your email in the first hour of every day. Don't\n   Tumblr founder David Karp will try not to check his email in the morning, and will continue his efforts until 9:30 or 10 o'clock. In an interview with Inc, he said, \"reading email at home never feels good or efficient. If something needs my immediate attention, someone will call or text me.\"\n   Most of us don't need a sense of readiness to constantly exchange emails for an organization or a job. As Julie Morgenstern's book \"never check email in the morning\" says, this is a good strategy. Even in the busiest time, you can use this time to do at least one practical thing.\n   If you need to make sure you don't miss some of the most important messages from some people, you can use awayfind to monitor your inbox and remind you when something worth noting comes into the box. This will be a gradual but meaningful process, which can train uninvited people who don't send letters to you during your office hours and colleagues who don't expect to receive your reply immediately in the morning.\n2. Harvest consciousness and learn to be grateful\n   There was a question on quora, \"how do the most successful people start their day every day?\". The most popular answer to this question comes from a fan of Tony Robbins, who talks about the first hour attention ceremony advocated by Tony Robbins.\n   Robbins suggests setting a \"energy hour\", \"30 minutes about growth\" or at least \"15 minutes about realization\". This includes light exercise and motivational spells, but the best part is to spend ten minutes thinking about you, your family and friends, and what you need to be grateful for in your career, and then imagine what your life will be like if you already have everything you want in your life.\n3. Do the heaviest thing first\n   Brian Tracy's most classic time management book, \"eat that frog\", comes from Mark Twain: \"if you swallow a frog raw first thing in the morning, you will forget the worst thing in the rest of the time, and nothing will get worse.\" Gina Trapani once explained in the \"smart work\" series of videos that here, the worst thing means the most important. Combined with the concept of \"do one thing before reading email\", you will get your own daily system. You need to stick to the method: choose your frog.\n   Tripani suggested, \"choose your frog, write it down with a piece of paper, and then you will see it when you return to your desk in the morning. If you can, put the materials you need to do things on the desk.\"\n   The advantage of dealing with terrible and important things as the first thing in the morning is that you will have room to do things away from other participants, away from those who will make things complicated and frustrating. Avoid their eyes. Terrible things can often be less complicated, and you will accomplish more for it.\n4. Ask yourself if you are doing what you want to do\n   The feeling of not being satisfied with your work should not be something you should realize after months or even years. Consider making a serious attempt every morning as Jobs said:\n   When I was 17 years old, I read a similar motto: \"if you live every day like you did on the last day of your life, then one day you will find yourself right.\" This sentence impressed me deeply. Since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself, \"If today is the last day of my life, will I want to do what I need to do today?\" And when the answer has been \"no\" for many days, I know it's time for me to change something.\n5. Do \"customer service\" or similar humanized things\n   Craig Newmark, the founder of craiglist, was very concise when he answered what he did in his first hour: \"customer service.\" He explained that he was participating in a project to serve military families and veterans and protect the right to vote. And customer service is also what Newmark does every day on Craigslist. He responded to users' complaints and hit swindlers and spammers hard. In fact, he has more important things to do every day, but Newmark said that customer service \"let me stop in reality\".\n   Back to us, \"customer service\" may be to keep in touch with previous project contacts, check in with your less interactive colleagues, ask mentor questions, or just deal with humanized work that will quickly disappear between task lists.

"2019年韩国骗保大案：2019年6月30号，妻子李恩海找来了好友曹贤洙、李贤珠等4男3女去平龙沼溪谷游玩，当时尹相烨也陪同妻子过去，傍晚时有一对情侣先回到停车场，只剩下了3男2女在溪谷边玩水，李恩海让3名男士玩一次跳水，在陆续跳水之后，曹贤洙和李贤珠很快回来了，但尹相烨却不见了，找不到的情况下报警，最终捞到了尹相烨，他溺毙在溪谷中。\n\n由于尹相烨身上无外力袭击的痕迹，被认定为意外溺水，几个月后妻子李恩海找保险公司索赔8亿的赔偿，但保险公司认为尹相烨的死亡时间，离到期只有4个小时，一切都太巧合了，李恩海为丈夫买了4份巨额意外保险，保险公司认为有骗保的可能，李恩海眼看拿不到8亿，非常不满，求助媒体给保险公司施压，上了SBS的电视节目《我想知道真相》上。没成想施压无果，反而让节目组也起了疑心，开始调查。他们在调查中发现，妻子和情人在死者死亡前的半年中，还有两次谋杀行为，只不过都以失败告终。这次在保单有效期的最后几个小时，终于成功了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bQp3z-1XTaYlvUSKNtFmW.png?height=732&width=1184)\n\n死者夫妻合照\n\n由于这些调查结果太过严重，2021年2月开始，仁川地方检察厅接手该案件，开始对李恩海进行了调查，并寻找到李恩海和情人赵贤洙涉嫌谋杀的证据。2021年12月，李恩海和赵贤洙被传唤调查。结果两人销声匿迹、下落不明。二人失踪后，警方发布了通缉令，然后李恩海两任前男友意外身亡的事情也被曝光，第一任男友2010年在一场车祸中丧生，李恩海当时在车上，事发后她获得了保险公司的一笔赔偿，第二任男友2014年在泰国芭堤雅潜水时出了意外，李恩海当时描述的情况，其实与警方调查有出入，但当时死者家人收到了抚恤金，也没有过多追究，李恩海又一次收到了保险金的赔偿。\n\n2022年4月16日逮捕两人并移交检察厅，至此，此案的真相在两人的落网后水落石出。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E25mXpJrnxRjO2k7Ge-Bt.png?height=898&width=1280)\n\n韩国骗保还有比李恩海还狠的人，她就是韩国最著名的“连环残杀亲人巨额骗保案”主角——严仁淑。\n\n严仁淑于1976年出生在江南江原道的一个普通家庭，上有一个哥哥，下有一个弟弟。她长相甜美，是不折不扣的天然美人坯子，在整形大国来说自然是众多男生簇拥追慕的对象。从小严仁淑就是个问题少女，严仁淑高中时就因为偷同学的钱被强制转学。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/r_b4R3OLlf7kG-PMzFGRW.png?height=1092&width=1154)\n\n父母对她很是溺爱，父母以为严仁淑长大就会好起来，事情却和他们想的不一样。她不仅偷同学的钱，还偷母亲的嫁妆偷偷卖掉，高中的时候她父亲去世了，全家都很悲痛，而严仁淑当时居然偷了父亲的银行卡，疯狂买奢侈品！她的物欲超出常人，为了钱什么都做得出来。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j1KoZBbVf-AiGzn7zPVkL.png?height=642&width=1280)\n\n21岁的严仁淑孤身一人来到了首尔，她在这里找到了一份保险设计师的工作。名字听起来高大上，实际就是卖保险。在这个岗位上，她将保险行业的规则吃得非常透彻。补充一点，在韩国保险理赔的金额的高低，最高的是死亡，然后是失明和烧伤，所以这3种方法也贯穿严仁淑作案的这个始终，就是弄瞎、烧伤最后杀死！\n\n保险行业没让严仁淑成为业绩高手，反而成为她后来泯灭人性的犯罪的技术指导。没过多久，严仁淑认识了在搬家公司工作的26岁男子李某。李某长相英俊，严仁淑很快和他坠入爱河。尽管两家人都不看好这段婚姻，严仁淑还是和李某结婚了。\n\n李某对严仁淑有求必应，一开始两人相处得不错，还生下了一个女儿。但是李某的工资微薄，即使把工资全部上交也无法满足自己对奢侈生活的向往和追求两个人开始了争吵。\n\n2000年2月份，他们三岁的女儿从楼梯摔下意外身亡，严仁淑和丈夫悲惨万分。他们短暂地和好了，李某觉得亏欠严仁淑很多，对她千依百顺。\n\n但女儿的死是严仁淑彻底释放了狠毒与残忍，她表面和丈夫相互安慰，实际已经开始设计她的害人计划。在无法磨灭的丧女之痛中，保险公司的一笔赔付却让严仁淑在黑暗中看到一条邪恶之路。\n\n**打开地狱之门**\n\n2000年3月，严仁淑凭借从前保险设计师的工作经验，一个月内为丈夫买了四份高额的保险，所有的保险受益人都写了严仁淑自己的名字。同时，严仁淑声称因为丧女得了抑郁症，需要定期去精神病院看医生，每次医生都会给她开一些抗抑郁药和安眠药。\n\n2000年5月，严仁淑给丈夫喝下了掺杂抗抑郁症药物的饮料，她趁丈夫迷糊时将他一把推下楼梯。\n\n李某因为脑震荡住院治疗三周，出院次月又被妻子推下楼梯伪装成意外事故，严仁淑以此骗取了高额保险金。\n\n李某接连受伤后，原本不喜欢严仁淑的婆家难道不怀疑她吗？\n\n婆家确实一点没有怀疑过严仁淑，原因是李某以前就患过精神疾病。现在李某受了伤，严仁淑不离不弃的照顾让李家人很感动，不仅不怀疑，还要接纳严仁淑。\n\n然而推下楼梯只是开胃菜，同年5月严仁淑还不满足，给丈夫喂下安眠药后，她趁丈夫睡着扒开了李某的眼皮，用别针扎瞎了李某右眼。李某刚治疗完眼睛出院，严仁淑又故技重施把热油淋到了李某脸上。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nDlEGXiFBVVDqUlTvGRF4.png?height=752&width=1168)\n\n严仁淑之所以选择这样折磨李某，是因为她知道眼球受伤和烧伤是仅次于死亡外保额最高的赔偿项目。\n\n李某一连串的受伤引起了医院的怀疑，医生找到李家人，劝他们仔细问问。\n\n李某家人询问严仁淑时底气很不足，他们不太愿意相信严仁淑会害自己的儿子，只是试探道：“仁淑啊，你能再跟我说说我儿子是怎么受伤的吗？”\n\n重复谎言很难，严仁淑没有上当，她故作柔弱地说：“这些伤都是老公精神病发作弄的，具体过程我也不清楚。老公是因为生病了，他不是故意伤害自己的，你们要怪就怪我吧，是我没有看住他。”\n\n尽管这次试探被严仁淑完美躲过，她也因此收敛了几个月。\n\n2000年9月，严仁淑再也忍不住，她直接用刀捅了李某的肚子，对外依旧宣传这是丈夫精神病发作的自残行为导致的。次年1月和2月，严仁淑又捅了丈夫两次。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kp-hg1ekjpNkexcF24oJx.png?height=570&width=1280)\n\n接二连三的受伤，李某因为并发症死在了治疗精神病的医院里。\n\n严仁淑计划周密，当时的保险社之间也没有同步数据，她利用第一任丈夫轻松骗取了2亿韩币，让严仁淑可以任意挥霍一段时间。\n\n**再次寻找猎物**\n\n2001年5月，严仁淑就在夜店找到了下一个目标，31岁的林某。\n\n严仁淑的长相美丽大方，出手阔绰，林某认为自己捡到了宝，高兴得不行。为了尽快嫁给林某，严仁淑从6月就开始和林某同居。严仁淑这次没有用真实身份，她谎称自己是名牌大学毕业的幼儿园老师，家里还有10亿财产等着她继承。\n\n严仁淑只有嫁给林某才能骗保，她开始对自己进行全方位的包装，曾一次性花3000多万韩币给男友送新车。\n\n2002年11月，严仁淑照搬对第一任丈夫的手法，给林某悄悄喂下了精神类药物，林某直接摔倒导致尾骨骨折。\n\n林某差点变成瘫痪，严仁淑却不离不弃，他同意了结婚，严仁淑迅速拿着两人的印章登记。\n\n摔倒、瞎眼和烧伤，严仁淑正想靠着三件套对林某为所欲为。可惜林某身体不如李某，林某在2003年2月治疗途中就因为伤口恶化离世了，严仁淑只骗取了4000万保险金。\n\n林某家人不能接受儿子英年早逝，他们提议对林某进行尸检，严仁淑害怕被识破，当时怀孕5个月的她提出要和丈夫举办一场灵魂婚礼。严仁淑举办了盛大的婚礼，过程中她对丈夫的“真情流露”打消了林某家人的怀疑。\n\n不过孩子刚出生不久便夭折了。\n\n残害林某的案子就这样被严仁淑瞒天过海，危机解除后就带着钱去肆意挥霍了。\n\n来钱快，去得更快。在奢靡中将钱财挥霍一空的严仁淑开始了新的恶毒计划。\n\n第二次婚姻让严仁淑想明白了一件事，要诈骗其他人的保险，她必须长期投入且和对方结婚，毕竟杀死自己的丈夫这种方式的确太慢了，那只要是家人，不就可以直接下手了吗？\n\n结婚需要时间，还是家人方便，严仁淑开始计划骗取家人的保险。\n\n2003年7月，严仁淑喂母亲喝下了加有安眠药的果汁，他贴心地对母亲说：“妈妈，这个可是最新的保健品哦，喝了补充营养。”\n\n母亲毫无防备地喝下果汁陷入昏迷，她又拿起注射针扎进了母亲右眼。同年11月，严仁淑对哥哥故技重施，趁哥哥睡着往他右眼倒了盐酸。有了两次经验的她，为了避免怀疑提前买好的保险里没有直接把受益人写成自己，哥哥的受益人是母亲，母亲的受益人是哥哥。\n\n母亲和哥哥半年内都变成了瞎子，哥哥起了怀疑，他问严仁淑：“你回到家后，家里人都受伤了啊。”\n\n严仁淑不打算放过哥哥，她趁护士不在对哥哥的吊瓶动了手脚，想用哥哥的死诈骗更高的保险金额，但哥哥被及时抢救没有死。\n\n现在两个人都需要严仁淑照顾，按理说是会主动保险给她的。母亲毫无怀疑地给了严仁淑全部保险金，哥哥却因为知道严仁淑过去就花钱大手大脚，不同意把保险金一次性给她。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lzih4XPWWJdTu7E1dxuEw.png?height=524&width=722)\n\n严仁淑为了保险金又在家里呆了一年多，然后她就发现保险金不够花了。严仁淑没有放弃利用家里人，这次她盯上了一家四口居住的房子。\n\n当哥哥像往常一样质问严仁淑到底把钱花到哪里时，严仁淑抓住机会说：“哥，我没有乱花钱，我把钱都攒起来买首尔的房子了。”\n\n哥哥疑惑道：“你的钱够买首尔的房子吗？”\n\n严仁淑狡黠地笑了起来：“不够啊，所以我想把我们家的旧房子卖掉，一起去首尔住新房子。”\n\n哥哥不是很相信严仁淑的话，母亲却说：“哎呀，我们严仁淑真是长大了，这么漂亮，还这么有孝心。”\n\n母亲帮严仁淑抵押房子还了钱，严仁淑也承诺了入住时间。\n\n随着时间越来越近，严仁淑眼看着就瞒不下去了。哥哥问她：“房子呢？”\n\n严仁淑装傻答：“在首尔啊。”\n\n哥哥仿佛看穿了严仁淑的算盘，他挖苦道：“是什么房子？空气房吧，看不见摸不着，哈哈哈哈哈哈。”\n\n哥哥的嘲讽让严仁淑怒火中烧，她要一把火烧了这个家，这样问题就解决了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XBkJ_GwuEMQoE2sFone5Q.png?height=726&width=1172)\n\n严仁淑提前给全家下了安眠药，警觉的哥哥却提前醒过来扑灭了大火，他的手臂被烧伤，弟弟因为吸入太多烟尘造成呼吸道烧伤。。\n\n严仁淑凭借火灾直接从保险公司骗到了2亿400万韩元，虽然骗到了钱，但严仁淑现在没有地方住了，她该去哪里落脚呢？\n\n**善良的可怜人，带给全家灭顶之灾**\n\n房子烧了后严仁淑无处可去，她找到了曾为自己工作过的保姆姜某。\n\n姜某是个善良的人，要是其他人，她很愿意收留，可严仁淑已经拖欠了她好几个月工资了，她只能说：“我和老公孩子一家四口一起住，没有多余的房间了，实在怕委屈您啊。”\n\n严仁淑摆出了一幅无助的样子，梨花带雨说：“我的家被烧了，我好害怕，好想你陪陪我。”\n\n姜某也可怜严仁淑，她表情为难，一时拿不定主意。\n\n严仁淑又承诺：“我只住一个月，离开时会还清拖欠的工资，还会给酬金。”\n\n姜某让恶魔住进了家，但身价上亿的严仁淑住了好几个月都没有走，也丝毫没有要还工资的样子，每天对她颐指气使，还当她是下人。\n\n姜某彻底生气了：“哎呦，从没有见过你这么抠的人，穿着名牌却连保姆的工资都付不起，该不会全是假货吧？”\n\n姜某平时温温柔柔，严仁淑从来没想过会被她嘲讽，她态度软和了下来：“对不起，我明天就搬走，再给我一天时间收拾东西吧。”\n\n姜某不是不讲情面的人，她同意严仁淑再住一晚，但是她不知道严仁淑因为她一句话已经起了杀心。\n\n当天夜里，严仁淑将带火的毛巾扔到了姜家的沙发上，姜某的丈夫直接死亡，姜某的两个孩子也被严重烧伤。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l-uaLOI1OCt1RDtVZzm8E.png?height=692&width=1280)\n\n放完火后，严仁淑才想起来这场火灾不但不会给自己带来任何收益，而且还会被人怀疑。她怕还活着的姜某看出端倪，准备斩草除根，在医院应急通道倒上汽油准备纵火。\n\n医院的监控拍到了严仁淑纵火过程，她当场被警察押回警察局审问。\n\n回到警局后，严仁淑在警局拒不认罪，还不停做出奇怪的举动，声称女儿死后自己得了精神疾病，只要看到火花就忍不住纵火，她不是故意的。\n\n警察当然不相信严仁淑的话，正准备先把她扣押起来，严仁淑却躺在地上口吐白沫，当场尿了出来。\n\n严仁淑身高接近1米7，身材较好，皮肤白皙，五官精致，说话也很温柔。没有人看出，她和天使外表不同，有着最邪恶的内心。\n\n警方也在一时之间被严仁淑的外表迷惑，虽然医生说严仁淑没有问题，但警方询问几句后还是放走了她。\n\n严仁淑刚被放回去，她的亲弟弟却到了警局，他告诉警方姐姐身边的人都会不停受伤，有必要再好好调查一下姐姐。\n\n不查不知道，一查吓一跳。五年时间里，严仁淑身边足足有8名因为相似原因死亡或受伤的人，累计领取保险金5亿6000万韩币，约330万人民币。\n\n严仁淑被捕后，因为故意杀人罪等九项罪名被判处了无期徒刑，目前已经在清州女子监狱服刑。\n\n严仁淑的计划不算高明，她最可怕的是让受害人家属感恩戴德，觉得她是忠贞不渝的好媳妇！下手亲人也毫不手软不光是丈夫和母亲，严仁淑在后来承认，和第一任丈夫生下的女儿也是她亲手推下楼梯的，和第二任丈夫生下的早产男孩也是被她害死的。 \n \n\n严仁淑极端的反社会人格到底是什么时候产生的，其实她从小时候就表现出了异于常人的拜金、虚荣、冷血。这位轰动韩国的杀人骗保女魔头--严仁淑的经历，简直让人毛骨悚然。", "timestamp": 1657379543, "digest": "ikVFUOZI8-y7Eb5JiKhOfznGd5oihcXLj8MuAqRspU8", "contributor":

"2019年韩国骗保大案：2019年6月30号，妻子李恩海找来了好友曹贤洙、李贤珠等4男3女去平龙沼溪谷游玩，当时尹相烨也陪同妻子过去，傍晚时有一对情侣先回到停车场，只剩下了3男2女在溪谷边玩水，李恩海让3名男士玩一次跳水，在陆续跳水之后，曹贤洙和李贤珠很快回来了，但尹相烨却不见了，找不到的情况下报警，最终捞到了尹相烨，他溺毙在溪谷中。\n\n由于尹相烨身上无外力袭击的痕迹，被认定为意外溺水，几个月后妻子李恩海找保险公司索赔8亿的赔偿，但保险公司认为尹相烨的死亡时间，离到期只有4个小时，一切都太巧合了，李恩海为丈夫买了4份巨额意外保险，保险公司认为有骗保的可能，李恩海眼看拿不到8亿，非常不满，求助媒体给保险公司施压，上了SBS的电视节目《我想知道真相》上。没成想施压无果，反而让节目组也起了疑心，开始调查。他们在调查中发现，妻子和情人在死者死亡前的半年中，还有两次谋杀行为，只不过都以失败告终。这次在保单有效期的最后几个小时，终于成功了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bQp3z-1XTaYlvUSKNtFmW.png?height=732&width=1184)\n\n死者夫妻合照\n\n由于这些调查结果太过严重，2021年2月开始，仁川地方检察厅接手该案件，开始对李恩海进行了调查，并寻找到李恩海和情人赵贤洙涉嫌谋杀的证据。2021年12月，李恩海和赵贤洙被传唤调查。结果两人销声匿迹、下落不明。二人失踪后，警方发布了通缉令，然后李恩海两任前男友意外身亡的事情也被曝光，第一任男友2010年在一场车祸中丧生，李恩海当时在车上，事发后她获得了保险公司的一笔赔偿，第二任男友2014年在泰国芭堤雅潜水时出了意外，李恩海当时描述的情况，其实与警方调查有出入，但当时死者家人收到了抚恤金，也没有过多追究，李恩海又一次收到了保险金的赔偿。\n\n2022年4月16日逮捕两人并移交检察厅，至此，此案的真相在两人的落网后水落石出。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E25mXpJrnxRjO2k7Ge-Bt.png?height=898&width=1280)\n\n韩国骗保还有比李恩海还狠的人，她就是韩国最著名的“连环残杀亲人巨额骗保案”主角——严仁淑。\n\n严仁淑于1976年出生在江南江原道的一个普通家庭，上有一个哥哥，下有一个弟弟。她长相甜美，是不折不扣的天然美人坯子，在整形大国来说自然是众多男生簇拥追慕的对象。从小严仁淑就是个问题少女，严仁淑高中时就因为偷同学的钱被强制转学。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/r_b4R3OLlf7kG-PMzFGRW.png?height=1092&width=1154)\n\n父母对她很是溺爱，父母以为严仁淑长大就会好起来，事情却和他们想的不一样。她不仅偷同学的钱，还偷母亲的嫁妆偷偷卖掉，高中的时候她父亲去世了，全家都很悲痛，而严仁淑当时居然偷了父亲的银行卡，疯狂买奢侈品！她的物欲超出常人，为了钱什么都做得出来。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j1KoZBbVf-AiGzn7zPVkL.png?height=642&width=1280)\n\n21岁的严仁淑孤身一人来到了首尔，她在这里找到了一份保险设计师的工作。名字听起来高大上，实际就是卖保险。在这个岗位上，她将保险行业的规则吃得非常透彻。补充一点，在韩国保险理赔的金额的高低，最高的是死亡，然后是失明和烧伤，所以这3种方法也贯穿严仁淑作案的这个始终，就是弄瞎、烧伤最后杀死！\n\n保险行业没让严仁淑成为业绩高手，反而成为她后来泯灭人性的犯罪的技术指导。没过多久，严仁淑认识了在搬家公司工作的26岁男子李某。李某长相英俊，严仁淑很快和他坠入爱河。尽管两家人都不看好这段婚姻，严仁淑还是和李某结婚了。\n\n李某对严仁淑有求必应，一开始两人相处得不错，还生下了一个女儿。但是李某的工资微薄，即使把工资全部上交也无法满足自己对奢侈生活的向往和追求两个人开始了争吵。\n\n2000年2月份，他们三岁的女儿从楼梯摔下意外身亡，严仁淑和丈夫悲惨万分。他们短暂地和好了，李某觉得亏欠严仁淑很多，对她千依百顺。\n\n但女儿的死是严仁淑彻底释放了狠毒与残忍，她表面和丈夫相互安慰，实际已经开始设计她的害人计划。在无法磨灭的丧女之痛中，保险公司的一笔赔付却让严仁淑在黑暗中看到一条邪恶之路。\n\n**打开地狱之门**\n\n2000年3月，严仁淑凭借从前保险设计师的工作经验，一个月内为丈夫买了四份高额的保险，所有的保险受益人都写了严仁淑自己的名字。同时，严仁淑声称因为丧女得了抑郁症，需要定期去精神病院看医生，每次医生都会给她开一些抗抑郁药和安眠药。\n\n2000年5月，严仁淑给丈夫喝下了掺杂抗抑郁症药物的饮料，她趁丈夫迷糊时将他一把推下楼梯。\n\n李某因为脑震荡住院治疗三周，出院次月又被妻子推下楼梯伪装成意外事故，严仁淑以此骗取了高额保险金。\n\n李某接连受伤后，原本不喜欢严仁淑的婆家难道不怀疑她吗？\n\n婆家确实一点没有怀疑过严仁淑，原因是李某以前就患过精神疾病。现在李某受了伤，严仁淑不离不弃的照顾让李家人很感动，不仅不怀疑，还要接纳严仁淑。\n\n然而推下楼梯只是开胃菜，同年5月严仁淑还不满足，给丈夫喂下安眠药后，她趁丈夫睡着扒开了李某的眼皮，用别针扎瞎了李某右眼。李某刚治疗完眼睛出院，严仁淑又故技重施把热油淋到了李某脸上。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nDlEGXiFBVVDqUlTvGRF4.png?height=752&width=1168)\n\n严仁淑之所以选择这样折磨李某，是因为她知道眼球受伤和烧伤是仅次于死亡外保额最高的赔偿项目。\n\n李某一连串的受伤引起了医院的怀疑，医生找到李家人，劝他们仔细问问。\n\n李某家人询问严仁淑时底气很不足，他们不太愿意相信严仁淑会害自己的儿子，只是试探道：“仁淑啊，你能再跟我说说我儿子是怎么受伤的吗？”\n\n重复谎言很难，严仁淑没有上当，她故作柔弱地说：“这些伤都是老公精神病发作弄的，具体过程我也不清楚。老公是因为生病了，他不是故意伤害自己的，你们要怪就怪我吧，是我没有看住他。”\n\n尽管这次试探被严仁淑完美躲过，她也因此收敛了几个月。\n\n2000年9月，严仁淑再也忍不住，她直接用刀捅了李某的肚子，对外依旧宣传这是丈夫精神病发作的自残行为导致的。次年1月和2月，严仁淑又捅了丈夫两次。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kp-hg1ekjpNkexcF24oJx.png?height=570&width=1280)\n\n接二连三的受伤，李某因为并发症死在了治疗精神病的医院里。\n\n严仁淑计划周密，当时的保险社之间也没有同步数据，她利用第一任丈夫轻松骗取了2亿韩币，让严仁淑可以任意挥霍一段时间。\n\n**再次寻找猎物**\n\n2001年5月，严仁淑就在夜店找到了下一个目标，31岁的林某。\n\n严仁淑的长相美丽大方，出手阔绰，林某认为自己捡到了宝，高兴得不行。为了尽快嫁给林某，严仁淑从6月就开始和林某同居。严仁淑这次没有用真实身份，她谎称自己是名牌大学毕业的幼儿园老师，家里还有10亿财产等着她继承。\n\n严仁淑只有嫁给林某才能骗保，她开始对自己进行全方位的包装，曾一次性花3000多万韩币给男友送新车。\n\n2002年11月，严仁淑照搬对第一任丈夫的手法，给林某悄悄喂下了精神类药物，林某直接摔倒导致尾骨骨折。\n\n林某差点变成瘫痪，严仁淑却不离不弃，他同意了结婚，严仁淑迅速拿着两人的印章登记。\n\n摔倒、瞎眼和烧伤，严仁淑正想靠着三件套对林某为所欲为。可惜林某身体不如李某，林某在2003年2月治疗途中就因为伤口恶化离世了，严仁淑只骗取了4000万保险金。\n\n林某家人不能接受儿子英年早逝，他们提议对林某进行尸检，严仁淑害怕被识破，当时怀孕5个月的她提出要和丈夫举办一场灵魂婚礼。严仁淑举办了盛大的婚礼，过程中她对丈夫的“真情流露”打消了林某家人的怀疑。\n\n不过孩子刚出生不久便夭折了。\n\n残害林某的案子就这样被严仁淑瞒天过海，危机解除后就带着钱去肆意挥霍了。\n\n来钱快，去得更快。在奢靡中将钱财挥霍一空的严仁淑开始了新的恶毒计划。\n\n第二次婚姻让严仁淑想明白了一件事，要诈骗其他人的保险，她必须长期投入且和对方结婚，毕竟杀死自己的丈夫这种方式的确太慢了，那只要是家人，不就可以直接下手了吗？\n\n结婚需要时间，还是家人方便，严仁淑开始计划骗取家人的保险。\n\n2003年7月，严仁淑喂母亲喝下了加有安眠药的果汁，他贴心地对母亲说：“妈妈，这个可是最新的保健品哦，喝了补充营养。”\n\n母亲毫无防备地喝下果汁陷入昏迷，她又拿起注射针扎进了母亲右眼。同年11月，严仁淑对哥哥故技重施，趁哥哥睡着往他右眼倒了盐酸。有了两次经验的她，为了避免怀疑提前买好的保险里没有直接把受益人写成自己，哥哥的受益人是母亲，母亲的受益人是哥哥。\n\n母亲和哥哥半年内都变成了瞎子，哥哥起了怀疑，他问严仁淑：“你回到家后，家里人都受伤了啊。”\n\n严仁淑不打算放过哥哥，她趁护士不在对哥哥的吊瓶动了手脚，想用哥哥的死诈骗更高的保险金额，但哥哥被及时抢救没有死。\n\n现在两个人都需要严仁淑照顾，按理说是会主动保险给她的。母亲毫无怀疑地给了严仁淑全部保险金，哥哥却因为知道严仁淑过去就花钱大手大脚，不同意把保险金一次性给她。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lzih4XPWWJdTu7E1dxuEw.png?height=524&width=722)\n\n严仁淑为了保险金又在家里呆了一年多，然后她就发现保险金不够花了。严仁淑没有放弃利用家里人，这次她盯上了一家四口居住的房子。\n\n当哥哥像往常一样质问严仁淑到底把钱花到哪里时，严仁淑抓住机会说：“哥，我没有乱花钱，我把钱都攒起来买首尔的房子了。”\n\n哥哥疑惑道：“你的钱够买首尔的房子吗？”\n\n严仁淑狡黠地笑了起来：“不够啊，所以我想把我们家的旧房子卖掉，一起去首尔住新房子。”\n\n哥哥不是很相信严仁淑的话，母亲却说：“哎呀，我们严仁淑真是长大了，这么漂亮，还这么有孝心。”\n\n母亲帮严仁淑抵押房子还了钱，严仁淑也承诺了入住时间。\n\n随着时间越来越近，严仁淑眼看着就瞒不下去了。哥哥问她：“房子呢？”\n\n严仁淑装傻答：“在首尔啊。”\n\n哥哥仿佛看穿了严仁淑的算盘，他挖苦道：“是什么房子？空气房吧，看不见摸不着，哈哈哈哈哈哈。”\n\n哥哥的嘲讽让严仁淑怒火中烧，她要一把火烧了这个家，这样问题就解决了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XBkJ_GwuEMQoE2sFone5Q.png?height=726&width=1172)\n\n严仁淑提前给全家下了安眠药，警觉的哥哥却提前醒过来扑灭了大火，他的手臂被烧伤，弟弟因为吸入太多烟尘造成呼吸道烧伤。。\n\n严仁淑凭借火灾直接从保险公司骗到了2亿400万韩元，虽然骗到了钱，但严仁淑现在没有地方住了，她该去哪里落脚呢？\n\n**善良的可怜人，带给全家灭顶之灾**\n\n房子烧了后严仁淑无处可去，她找到了曾为自己工作过的保姆姜某。\n\n姜某是个善良的人，要是其他人，她很愿意收留，可严仁淑已经拖欠了她好几个月工资了，她只能说：“我和老公孩子一家四口一起住，没有多余的房间了，实在怕委屈您啊。”\n\n严仁淑摆出了一幅无助的样子，梨花带雨说：“我的家被烧了，我好害怕，好想你陪陪我。”\n\n姜某也可怜严仁淑，她表情为难，一时拿不定主意。\n\n严仁淑又承诺：“我只住一个月，离开时会还清拖欠的工资，还会给酬金。”\n\n姜某让恶魔住进了家，但身价上亿的严仁淑住了好几个月都没有走，也丝毫没有要还工资的样子，每天对她颐指气使，还当她是下人。\n\n姜某彻底生气了：“哎呦，从没有见过你这么抠的人，穿着名牌却连保姆的工资都付不起，该不会全是假货吧？”\n\n姜某平时温温柔柔，严仁淑从来没想过会被她嘲讽，她态度软和了下来：“对不起，我明天就搬走，再给我一天时间收拾东西吧。”\n\n姜某不是不讲情面的人，她同意严仁淑再住一晚，但是她不知道严仁淑因为她一句话已经起了杀心。\n\n当天夜里，严仁淑将带火的毛巾扔到了姜家的沙发上，姜某的丈夫直接死亡，姜某的两个孩子也被严重烧伤。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l-uaLOI1OCt1RDtVZzm8E.png?height=692&width=1280)\n\n放完火后，严仁淑才想起来这场火灾不但不会给自己带来任何收益，而且还会被人怀疑。她怕还活着的姜某看出端倪，准备斩草除根，在医院应急通道倒上汽油准备纵火。\n\n医院的监控拍到了严仁淑纵火过程，她当场被警察押回警察局审问。\n\n回到警局后，严仁淑在警局拒不认罪，还不停做出奇怪的举动，声称女儿死后自己得了精神疾病，只要看到火花就忍不住纵火，她不是故意的。\n\n警察当然不相信严仁淑的话，正准备先把她扣押起来，严仁淑却躺在地上口吐白沫，当场尿了出来。\n\n严仁淑身高接近1米7，身材较好，皮肤白皙，五官精致，说话也很温柔。没有人看出，她和天使外表不同，有着最邪恶的内心。\n\n警方也在一时之间被严仁淑的外表迷惑，虽然医生说严仁淑没有问题，但警方询问几句后还是放走了她。\n\n严仁淑刚被放回去，她的亲弟弟却到了警局，他告诉警方姐姐身边的人都会不停受伤，有必要再好好调查一下姐姐。\n\n不查不知道，一查吓一跳。五年时间里，严仁淑身边足足有8名因为相似原因死亡或受伤的人，累计领取保险金5亿6000万韩币，约330万人民币。\n\n严仁淑被捕后，因为故意杀人罪等九项罪名被判处了无期徒刑，目前已经在清州女子监狱服刑。\n\n严仁淑的计划不算高明，她最可怕的是让受害人家属感恩戴德，觉得她是忠贞不渝的好媳妇！下手亲人也毫不手软不光是丈夫和母亲，严仁淑在后来承认，和第一任丈夫生下的女儿也是她亲手推下楼梯的，和第二任丈夫生下的早产男孩也是被她害死的。 \n \n\n严仁淑极端的反社会人格到底是什么时候产生的，其实她从小时候就表现出了异于常人的拜金、虚荣、冷血。这位轰动韩国的杀人骗保女魔头--严仁淑的经历，简直让人毛骨悚然。", "timestamp": 1657379716, "digest": "0ADuoagQt0_FYZe8jdsy_dswMUrjRp0YfgMlDWYsmxQ", "contributor":

{"id": "d1MOl_01BHS08Xx6ayWtKiCmvlX2kDy5BzAXNweNxXU", "title": "’Cause Bandra west is everywhere: The fallacy of scarcity in the Metaverse", "body": "**THE DESIRABILITY ARGUMENT:** Bandra west, IRL (in real life) is home to Bollywood’s mega stars. In an otherwise over crowded metropolis that is Mumbai, this suburb maintains it’s quaintness with colonial era cottages, greenery and a mix of accessible nightlife venues against a backdrop of skyscrapers, making it a highly desirable location. The same holds for other mega cities; Clarke Quay in Singapore… Sh.Zayed Road, Dubai… Sunset Strip…\n\nHowever, unlike real life, where natural land formations, weather and economic activity dictate the price of property and where slums jostle for space with high-rises as the header picture exemplifies…in the Metaverse\\* many of these constraints do not hold water (a little foreshadowing there).\n\n**Myth: LAND SCARCITY IN THE METAVERSE:** Scarcity in the Metaverse, is a myth. A myth propagated by unscrupulous crypto brokers — whose sole motivation is to speculate on profits of funny-money, a.k.a. cryptocurrency *after* a deal has been transacted. Thus their desire to turn the Metaverse into a ‘Cryptoverse’. A world where every interaction is a Transaction.\n\n*They forget, for scarcity to work in virtual real-estate, one needs to abolish that ancient practice of…Teleporting*\n\nNo one walks in the Metaverse. The mode of commuting is usually a laser point and click mechanic, to cover any amount of distance in a second. No downtown traffic to negotiate, no crowded footpaths to traverse.\n\nThe Cryptoverses selling digital land parcels, [and there a few of them reviewed here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/metaverse-being-designed-man-babies-clyde-desouza/), would have you believe that the same conditions that dictate prices IRL, apply to the Metaverse. Again — teleporting disproves it. Spinning up another server disproves it. The premise of ‘virtual society’ as an argument does not hold true.\n\nIn real life — yes, I’d likely not want to commute to ‘Sobo’ (South Bombay) to mingle, because it would take an hour. In the Metaverse I could mingle in virtual Times Square NY, and then teleport to Clarke Quay, Singapore, in a second. That’s what the metaverse offers.\n\n![The Atlantis Dubai: Underwater Suite](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zv9z_cHBgHBeud-hNISGj.jpg?height=717&width=1920)\n\nI was fortunate to visit the Atlantis Dubai’s Underwater Suite and remember saying to myself — This is the ***virtual world***\\* \\*I’d love to have projected on my windows at home. Such real estate would be at a premium as one would imagine. But, in a virtual world; a Metaverse? Those land-parcels that Cryptoverses like to dice into blocks and sell at a premium on the public Blockchain, because it’s near the coast or at the ‘city center’?… you understand why that’s a fallacy now.\n\n![The XR Metaverse draped over the Real World.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jcm0SvtaFmcLwi5-SHXa9.gif?height=293&width=520)\n\n\\***Plot Twist: THE XR METAVERSE**\n\nSo far we’ve been looking at the Metaverse to be a virtual world that’s either entered into typically via a VR headset for maximum immersion or, accessed through a desktop computer or tablet. However, the XR-Metaverse ***can drape*** itself as a digital overlay — pin registered — to the real world, and seen via Augmented Reality eyewear, or today, via a cellphone camera; dubbed video-seethru AR. Solutions such as [Google’s Spatial API ](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/geospatial)can make it happen. This was near-future hard sci-fi which I’d written about in 2010; [Will Google create a Surrogate Reality World](https://realvision.ae/blog/2010/01/will-google-create-a-surrogate-reality-world/), and today we can experience it.\n\nSo what does that mean for virtual real estate in the XR Metaverse? Surely — its value will proportionately skyrocket in tandem with its real world twin. Or will it?\n\n> *Who owns Bandra West in the XR Metaverse? — The Government, The Telcos, The Roads and Transport Authority?*\n\nThat’s the right question to ask. Cryptoverse operators who currently sell “land” at ridiculous prices will try to justify prices by saying ***their Metaverse***\\* \\*is pin-registered to the real world where real world inhabitants will be populating it (either in person or as digital avatars of themselves)\n\nThe problem is the metaverse needs to be accessed via a gateway — usually, a Telco gateway or portal.\n\n**ENTER, THE MULTIVERSE:**\n\nWho’s to stop:\n\n* Vodafone from running a parallel XRMetaverse draped over the same real world location as Reliance Jio does.\n* AT&T running their metaverse over Verizon’s pin registered to the same Times Square.\n* An enterprising Entrepreneur overlaying Bangalore’s MG road and storefront signage over Bandra’s Linking Road\n\nIndeed, there is no guarantee — just because celebs reside in real-life in one location that they would be seen in the XR metaverse at venues \\*in that same location \\*. They could be ‘partying’ at an underwater nightclub anywhere in the Metaverse.\n\n**CONCLUSION:** The Metaverse is a world of Abundance not of Scarcity\n\nScarcity if at all, will be driven not by rarity of NFTs (another fallacy there) or “Land parcels” but by bandwidth demands and the spatial mandates of avatar ‘personal space’ when accessing desirable hot-spots where like minded “minds” hang-out.

Osmosis，继IBC之后，看ICS, ICA如何重构加密行业，这里就不详细介绍了。\n\n## Cosmos的核心理念\n\n和Polkadot, Avalanche设计理念一样，Cosmos是致力于实现水平扩展的Layer0，Layer0协议认为未来多链趋势（interchain, not multichain)将势不可挡，而Comos则提供了可扩展以及独立自主的解决方案。Cosmos打败了传统胖协议论点的概念，并将自己视为主权和独立区块链以可组合方式共存的关键基础设施。胖协议瘦应用，其实也不这么绝对，dapp应用创造了很多价值，只是被协议捕获去了，而appchain则改变这点而变成胖应用。而其完美的工程设计也吸引了大量的社区爱好者，其创新包括：实现轻松部署POS链的Tendermint引擎，实现应用层面快速部署的Cosmos SDK，IBC统一协议之上的互操作性，多种共享安全的设计机制，EVM链的入口，Gravity Bridge；CosmWasm智能合约，满足以太坊上的合约开发场景；链的进退（选择不同主权方式，消费链，应用链等）；Zone之间的天然分片，变相隔离等；当然还有性能上的考虑，比如Celestia。\n\n当然和其他单片链以及其他Layer0协议而言，Cosmos提供了模块化，可插拔的方案以及更好的可扩展性，通过对可接受交易对手安全假设动态设定点的方式实现水平扩展。这些应用链可以自主选择虚拟机，节点要求，费率模型和治理，安全假设等，所以更难被分叉；特定应用主权链相较于单片链上的应用来说，对于减少MEV攻击拥有更多的方法，并且对其上各种经济活动激励拥有更多掌控权/定价权；开发者可以根据特定应用定制/优化运行环境，而不是搭建和EVM类似的通用优化环境。开发者可以自主选择开发语言和工具。例如Cosmos SDK是用Go语言写的，其也仅仅是搭建在Tendermint上的一种方式。例如一个做比特币桥的项目Nomic，虽然它是搭建在Tendermint上，但是它利用了自己的系统，用Rust语言开发应用，而不一定需要使用支持Go语言的Cosmos SDK, 但是它仍然可以接入IBC和其他相关应用链。比如开发者可以用Gravtiy Bridge开源代码满足其不同的应用开发场景，目前Secret Network, Injective Protocol等已经采用了其分叉版本。比如像BNB这样的链，虽然是基于Cosmos SDK开发的，但是其并没有接入IBC的功能。当然IBC不仅仅支持Tendermint链，对于任何可以接入IBC 客户界面的链，包括Polkadot，以太坊，Celo都可以。所以本质上Cosmos致力于成为主权和独立区块链以可组合方式共存的关键基础设施。对于这个工程设计感兴趣的朋友，可以看我们之前的详细解读Cosmos Thesis- Osmosis应用主权链的崛起。\n\n所以应用链本质上是一种新的设计方案。相比于以太坊的设计，协议层的更新只是通用型的更新，而非针对于某个应用的更新，而在Cosmos中，协议层的更新可以创建新的功能，从而为应用链赋能。比如在Osmosis上，协议层的更新会给其核心产品AMM带来很多新功能，比如Superfliud Staking， 比如隐私，比如阈值加密，比如隐私等。Void是Cosmos上提供隐私的解决方案，致力于为大户提供私密交易以及兑换，减少MEV攻击等问题，所以一旦协议层进行部署，Osmosis上所有应用都可以享有这个功能。而在以太坊上，针对于新的功能，每个单独应用都需要独立开发，大大增加了成本，同时带来了效率低下的资源定价，MEV等问题。\n\n### 设计中的Trade off问题\n\n尽管很多支持者都认为Cosmos的设计堪称完美，但是任何设计都存在trade off，只是核心在于我们如何去最小化它。这里的trade off我们指的是缺少链间的共享安全。这意味着每条链都享有独立的安全和架构，并且需要找到安全的节点集去维护网络，以及相对稳定的币价, TVL维护安全TVL （特指Defi协议）。而每条链都提供了不同节点数量，不同节点间的质押分布，代币分布，市值，从而风险以及去中心化程度也不尽相同。\n\n这意味着，如果一条IBC链需要连接另一条IBC链，那么需要考虑其风险以及安全假设。比如一条链受到攻击或者破坏了，那么其原生资产在其连接链上的合成资产也将变得一文不值。比如Terra的灭门事件中，Luna和UST大幅跳水后，其在Osmosis上的对应资产也就没有任何价值了。当然这是潜在的风险。但是从另一个角度思考，对于在Cosmos上搭建的应用链来说，往往具备相当高的门槛，前置的overheads,比如通过网络手续费以及通胀奖励激励的验证节点，以及维持TVL的稳定币价（币价，TVL，以及网络安全的问题我们之前文章中有解释过），当然还有固定的运营成本，而Terra也曾是Cosmos最为安全的链。所以这种风险的确无法避免，但是我们看到在Terra事件中，尽管Osmosis受到了很大影响，其很多的流动性池中都有UST，LUNA的资产导致TVL大幅下跌，从8.7亿美金到1.6亿美金（by Defi Llama at the time of writing)，币价也是一跌再跌, 人们为了退出UST和LUNA头寸，导致流动性池的另一边资产OSMO的价格也大幅跳水。然而Osmosis仍然正常工作，并且正常生产区块。而Cosmos上其他依赖于UST作为稳定币的生态也是遭受了重创。同样的，如果用户将资产从一条链发送到另一条链，那么资产也会受到目的地链的安全假设影响。比如用户将Atom从Cosmos Hub发送到Evmos网络，那么Atom会受制于Evmos的风险及安全假设（其五大节点掌控37%的算力，一般超过33.33%就需要警惕了）。所以Cosmos上每条链都有不同的安全假设。Cosmos的设计最小化了两个相互连接链的安全假设的”Blast Radius，所以尽管相互连接链会受到对方的安全影响，但是整个生态Cosmos屹立不倒。\n\n### 共享安全解决方案\n\n接下来我们为大家介绍三种共享安全解决方案。而图中主要阐述的是跨链安全(Interchain Security)和Interflui staking。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-LT8pBrPGavmVE5e7UbA-.png?height=645&width=1080)\n\n1） 第一种是跨链安全，跨链安全的服务对象是所有基于Cosmos SDK搭建的链, 而Cosmos Hub, 也就是Atom 质押者可以提供此功能。消费链，通常从Cosmos Hub的节点处借用安全的方式获得共享安全，可以理解为Atom质押者在维护Cosmos Hub安全的同时，也需要参与消费链的验证。而这种方式也会让Atom持有者在帮助维护其他新网络的同时，也会有额外的奖励（当然风险是如果新的网络被攻击了，那么质押代币也会有被Slash的风险）。跨链安全主要有三个版本，第一个版本是消费链享有Cosmos Hub的全部安全性，所以网络的安全取决于Cosmos Hub的安全。上线时间预计在Q3，2022。第一个版本不适合相对成熟的应用链, 目前计划接入的有Quicksliver以及Neutron等。第二个版本称为部分安全，应用链在享有Cosmos Hub安全的同时，也可以通过其自身的验证节点以及代币维护网络安全。我们认为像Osmsosis, Axelar这样的链会选择接入，计划上线时间在Q4,2022。和第一个版本中不一样，第一个版本中的消费链代币只用于治理功能，而在这个版本中，其质押代币可以和Atom质押代币同时维护网络的安全。而在V3版本中，Hub验证节点可以有权停止验证哪条链。第二，三个版本相较于第一个版本，网络安全将最终取决于消费链和供应链共同的安全。而对于Cosmos Hub的部分参与的节点来说，如果消费链上的唯一验证节点恶意进行攻击，会有女巫攻击的可能性。对这块感兴趣的朋友可以看我们之前的Cosmos的开拓者 - Osmosis，继IBC之后，看ICS, ICA如何重构加密行业 一文。\n\n当然这个解决方案中，我们认为其设计体现了去中心化的魅力，没有任何一个老大，任何老大出问题都不会对生态产生影响。红军大说之前在我们CFG社群中有提过，Cosmos Hub和其他所有新的Hub，比如Osmosis之间的对比\n\n* 大家都是一样的Hub，可以理解为都是高速公路\n* Cosmos Hub因为是第一条， 所以大家默认更赋能， 比如目前的共享安全是专为Cosmos Hub定制的\n* 当然，Cosmos Hub还有ATOM\n* 以后Osmosis Hub可不可以也推出共享安全？我觉得完全可以， 甚至都不用经过Cosmos生态的投票， 只要自己的zone喜欢就可以了， 以后其他新的消费链可以挂在Osmosis Hub上\n* 所以， Hub都是一样的， 几乎没有区别。都是高铁， 生意好的可以做豪华高铁， 生意不好的就绿皮车。” 我觉得在理。\n\n2）Celestia 为Rollups提供的共享安全性\n\nCelestia的服务对象分为以太坊上的Rollups以及Cosmos 上的Rollups，而Celestia本质上是一个数据可用层。对于像Celestia上原生的Rollups比如Cevmos，采用了Evmos 的结算层，以及Celestia的数据可见层。而Celestia也会相继接入各种执行环境，比如Optimsitic Rollups， Substract， Cosmos SDK，以及zk-rollups 等。我们之前也出过两篇文章。\n\n3）Osmosis的Interfluid staking\n\n在这种设计中，Cosmos SDK链的共享安全是通过Osmos上的LP池子获得的， Osmosis 将允许通过 Interfluid Staking 实现另一种形式的共享安全性。Interfluid Staking 允许 Osmosis 能允许流动资金池的资产质押在原生链上。比如在OSMO-SCRT LP 对，LP 对中的 SCRT 可以通过 IBC 传输并质押在Secret 网络上。当然LP 代币也会发生变化。所以通过这种方式，流动性池子中的LP仓位也可以参与网络的安全维护，而这个也主要受益于IBC以及其跨链转账，跨链账户等模块的设计。Superfluid staking已经上线，其中交易对中必须要有OSMO，目前OSMO验证节点参与维护另一条链的安全，而Interfliud staking，交易对中无需有OMO,计划于2022年Q4上线。所以对于应用链来说，通过在OSMO提供流动性的方式，进一步提升了他们网络的安全（激活了更多没有被有效利用的LP仓位）。而对于LP来说，其除了可以获得LP的费用（交易费，激励费用）以外，也能通过额外提供网络安全而获得质押费用。\n\n## 生态简介\n\n根据MapofZone (Mintscan), 我们根据Cosmos Hub选取了交易量最高的几条链做介绍。\n\n### Osmosis\n\nOsmosis 是一条专注于创建 Cosmos 的 DeFi 中心的应用链，其占据了整个IBC交易量的90%以上，毋庸置疑是Cosmos流动性之源泉。Cosmos生态的参与者如果要进行交易Cosmos SDK资产或者CW20资产，他们不得不通过Osmosis的DEX进行交易。AMM支持的DEX是Osmosis的核心产品，并且其提供用户可交互的多种流动性池子，核心产品上其拥有许可的智能合约功能，任何给其核心产品带来价值的应用都可以在治理通过之后，在其上搭建。目前Osmosis正在积极拓展其生态，通过Osmosis Open Grants (CFG labs 是Osmosis Grants目前在亚洲唯一支持的团队）等活动奖励在其上搭建的各种开发者和项目，并且在Terra事件之后，快速拉拢了大量原Terra生态的开发者，我们也接触了很多这领域的一手项目。尽管Terra的结局并不太好，但的确为行业也带来很多优秀的开发者。目前在Osmosis上搭建的项目，包括借贷协议，杠杆协议，合成资产，隐私保护等。除此以外，Osmosis的所有资产和流动性也可以通过代币转账以及跨链账户等IBC功能，与其他链进行交互。\n\n目前Osmosis 主要有两种前端\n\n● 主前端包含了经过治理批准的官方池，通常通过 OSMO 进行激励。所有桥接的 ERC-20 资产都是 Axelar 规范版本，因为它是治理通过的主要桥服务提供商。\n\n● 前沿版本包含了主前端中的所有池和未经治理许可的池，而未经许治理许可的池子无法获得OSMO 激励（可以有外部激励，通过 Dexmos工具查看）。同时包含任意桥接资产以及 CW-20 代币。多个桥接资产意味着同一资产的不同规范资产（规范资产的概念我们之前文章中也介绍过）表示。例如：g-USDC （Gravity Bridge) 和 axl-USDC Axelar) 。而不同的的规范资产之间无法相互替代，从而会导致流动性分散的问题，带来较差的用户体验。因此两个桥的设计保证了主前端给用户带来最佳用户体验的同时（只引入治理通过桥，Axlear)也始终保持了无需可的理念，任何其他桥的资产也可以在Osmosis上提供流动性。对于Osmosis上的真正无许可的Frontier 平台，代币列表新功能以及其他前沿新技术，可以查看我们之前的文章\n\nOsmosis Beyond Coinbase? 2022有哪些前沿技术和新功能。\n\n在 Osmosis 之上启动的其他值得注意的应用程序包括：\n\n● Mars：允许合约到合约借贷的借贷协议。这将取代之前原生Confio开发的借贷项目Isotonic，两者合并为Mas协议。其之前部署在 Terra，但Terra事件后，第一时间决定在Cosmos上搭建自己的应用链，而其也会在不同IBC链上部署“Outposts”，而第一个就是Osmosis。\n\n将推出拥有许多“前哨”的自己的连锁店，第一个是在 Osmosis 上。\n\n● Void Protocol：在 Osmosis 上启动的隐私应用程序，允许私人交易和掉期。它类似于以太坊上的 Tornado Cash。主要考虑到巨鲸地址的隐私保护以及MEV攻击（zkEVM)等问题。其他生态相关项目和开发工具可以查看OsmosisEcosystem。\n\n### Cosmos Hub\n\nCosmos Hub 是 PoS 链的第一个实例，它掌管着 ATOM 代币并为其他链提供公共资金(public funds）。Cosmos 上的大部分核心工具和基础设施都由 Cosmos Hub 负责，并且负责Cosmos上的协议研发。如今，许多链通过 Cosmos Hub 上的 ATOM 质押者空投代币的形式（社区中称为stakedrop）进入其多元化的社区并访问多元化的验证者集。Cosmos 枢纽是基于可信中立和 Hub 极简主义，从而确保其他链可以完全主权，并且拥有对其链的完全自主权的同时还可以通过 IBC 实现互操作性。Cosmos Hub 即将上线跨链新功能，其中包括跨链安全和 IBC 路由即服务，有助于推动整个 Cosmos 生态系统的更多发展。\n\n### Evmos\n\nEvmos 是建立在Cosmos SDK上， 通过Tendermint BFT 共识机制获取安全性的EVM兼容Layer 1 区块， 理解为Cosmos上的EVM Hub。它为那些基于EVM 的应用提供了护城河，它们不仅可以在Evmos上开发，同时能够和Cosmos 生态相兼容。ERC-20代币和Cosmos原生代币的可组合性显得至关重要，因为这样Evmos上的应用除了可以在Evmos上实现快速确认，较低的手续费以外，同时能够享受到IBC 生态的流动性， Evmos 是Cosmos生态第一条实现EVM 兼容的链，同时它可以和Cosmos 生态其他的链实现本地交互 （Cronos, Crypto.com开发在Cosmos 上 的EVM 兼容链，虽然接入了IBC 功能，但是无法实现资产交互和大规模的通道互通。所以如果说EVM 注重在可编程性以及可组合性，Cosmos强调独立主权以及可互操作性，那么Evmos则是真正的可编程的可互操作性。\n\n那么EVM有什么核心设计特点呢？第一是它的可组合性和UX，EVM多链的设计并不具有可扩展性，开发通常需要维护不同的链，从而无法专注在核心技术的开发，而Evmos只需要一次部署，就可以享有跨链间（interchain, not multichain)的优势，而应用间也可以通过IBC（无需信任）以及桥（可信任）进行链接。从用户角度，用户可以通过一个钱包管理跨链间的所有地址，而无需像使用小狐狸钱包和Keplr钱包一样需要在不同链的钱包上（不同Prefix）进行切换。第二个特征是它的Ethermint，共享安全的设计。EVM 在Cosmos上相较于在ERC20链上的一些特点比如快速确认，可组合性，模块化，低交易手续费等。同时，Evmos是发展在Cosmos上的独立主权区块链，所以可以与IBC通信上其他枢纽实现互操作性，同时也可以和其他Cosmos上智能合约框架和模块实现通信。这种互通能够实现更高阶的Defi策略，实现更高级别的互操作性。同时，Evmos上的开发者利用Ethermint模块可以选择开发自己的独立链，同时可以选择可插拔共享安全模块的功能。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ms00Rp9fjyb7mQ6IeDwCW.png?height=590&width=1080)\n\n第三个特点则是其经济模型的设计，其在EIP1559中的设计上做了改进，将燃烧的基本费用一部分一半给到开发者，一半给到矿工，让开发者，用户，质押者的利益可以实现更好地平衡。对于Evmos感兴趣的朋友可以看我们之前的文章下一个Cosmos Hub，EVM枢纽，我们也将会在之后出一些关于Evmos的深度研究。\n\n### Stargaze\n\nNFT 在 Cosmos 生态系统中相当早期，但有一些链、市场和 NFT已经开始启动。\n\nStargaze 是 Cosmos 上专注于将 NFT 市场引入 Cosmos\n\n生态系统的应用链。目前marketplace也是最近才上线，铸造功能一直就有，而且还仍然在Beta版本中，并没有正式上线。因为其接入了IBC，因而其市场可以与其他市场链上的NFT实现可互操作性。尽管其最近IBC排名呈现下滑趋势（第5到第15），但其独特的设计机制仍然值得关注（比如通过质押NFT资产可以获得区块45%的奖励）。同时我们在Solana 的逆袭之路 - SQLANA文中介绍过，Solana目前的NFT交易量仅次于排名第一️的以太坊（占据了以太坊的5%-6%），当然项目数量、独立买卖者、交易笔数等也都是非常好的衡量标准，其中较低的单价、手续费是主要原因。同时作为Solana生态上最大的交易市场玩家Magic Eden，不管从用户基数（日用户在38,000)，还是交易量都排名第一，仅次于其的分别是Solanart和Solesea (用户都在2,000-3,000) 等表现都非常出现，其也于近日宣布完成了由Electric Capital和Greylock领投的1.3亿美金的B轮融资，Solana上一直没有出现蓝筹的PFP项目。而Cosmos上的Bad Kids似乎获得很多社区支持者，比如Sunny Aggarwal （CEO of Osmosis) 等KOL就用了他们作为头像。的认可。bad Kid 总共有9999张，每个坏孩子都有一堆数据：年龄、大脑、肌肉，当然还有坏处。每个坏孩子都是坏孩子，但有些孩子甚至更坏。这些数字是根据每个孩子的艺术和稀有性生成的。您还可以了解不同组件的名称，例如眼睛、发型等。\n\n### Juno\n\nJuno 网络是Cosmos 生态中的一条专注于无需许可智能合约开发的Layer1公链，主要基于Cosmos SDK 开发，引入Tendermint BFT 共识机制来维护网络的安全。Cosmos Hub 作为Cosmos生态的”母亲”， 一直遵守着其“可信中立”以及“极简主义”的原则，因此将社区所有的智能合约开发都承载到Juno 网络，Juno 网络应运而生（这个很常见，之前Gravity DEX 也准备在Cosmos Hub 上开发，但是考虑到以上等因素，现在转移到自己的公链并且重新命名为Cresent Protocol。在Cosmos 上，所有的链都是针对于某些特定应用场景而开发的， 我们看到了Osmosis, Cosmos 生态上的最大的流动性/AMM 链，Umee, 专注在借贷领域的借贷链，Juno则是智能合约开发领域的王者，以往Cosmos 生态的开发者在Cosmos上开发，需要开发自己的Layer 1 链，现在Juno的出现大大降低了开发者们的门槛，让很多的开发者可以专注在App开发的同时享受到IBC的跨链优势。\n\n我们不得不承认Juno 网络上的应用都非常独体，基于其独特的设计框架和成功地引入了Cosmwasm智能合约框架的经验，我们看到了很多DAO 工具的出现， DAODAO 是一款让人们快速创建DAO的DAO工具，提供了很多DAO相关活动的一键完成功能，例如投票，创建，部署，参与等。同时和其他DAO 产品不一样，它还有特有的跨链功能，例如可以在Juno chain上管理Osmosis 上的账户。当然还有很多其他创新的项目。Juno 主打的是无许可部署链，而Cosmos生态其他的应用链需要通过治理来让更多的Cosmwasm 项目在他们的主链上搭建 （比如Osmosis 的治理非常活跃，几乎每天都有，他们最近也开始接入Cosmwasm，希望优质的Defi项目接入他们的生态）。对于Juno感兴趣的朋友，可以看我们的Juno 网络 - Cosmos 生态的智能合约枢纽。\n\n## 可扩展性解决方案\n\nCosmos 通过拥有许多独立的Zone进行扩展，而每条链上的扩展性扩展路线图将取决于其各自的交易活动以及历史的设计理念。比如相比于通用型的应用链（Juno), 应用链的扩展性问题相对可控（Osmosis, 其支持与其核心产品相得益彰的应用，并且需要通过治理通过）。目前应用链层面有很多可选可扩展性方案，目前Celestia致力于解决Rollups上的可扩展问题。理论上每条搭建在Tendermint上的应用链可容纳 150 个验证者，但理论上开发者拥有“无限”\n\n水平可扩展性，因为如果一个链条变得过于拥挤，开发者始终可以启动通过 IBC 互连的新链，当然trade off就是额外的安全假设。\n\n当然共识层面也开始能够提供更快的出块时间和更多的验证器集。在 Quicksilver 目前测试网中，其有 500 多个验证者，这些验证者的出块权重为 6 秒，而其他链也在试验 2 秒的出块时间 （Cosmos 目前平均出块时间为6秒，Evmos为2秒，极大的提升了区块时间），这将极大的增加可扩展性。因此，除了应用链当前可用的扩展路径之外，共识层面也在进行更改，从而实现更多可扩展性。\n\n## 潜在风险及总结\n\nCosmos 生态系统是Layer0，因此成败取决于每个单独的链。所以这才是去中心化的灵魂，没有任何一个老大，老大可以随时去死。Cosmos Hub可否去掉，Terra生态的灭亡，都没有太大的问题。这就是我们上文提到的完美设计，最小化了相互连接的独立链间安全假设的Blast Radius 爆炸半径问题。\n\n而对于Cosmos整个生态的失败，那么主要来自于竞争风险。以太坊Rollups Centric的理念会不会进一步吞噬应用链的现有市场？我们认为这种可能性比较低，和以太坊相比，Cosmos也采用了完全不一样的设计框架与理念，如果说以太坊是个帝国，那么cosmos是个联盟。虽然他们有不同的愿景、不同的文化、不同的机制，但是他们终有一战，用相得益彰或者更为恰当。\n\n而对于Cosmos 上的其他竞争对手比如Polkadot、Avalanche 或 NEAR，我们认为其缺少核心的IBC灵魂的设计，或者其只是采用了在不同共识引擎上启动EVM链，换汤不换药的做法。而我们看到这些链似乎正在加速与IBC的连接，无论是Near, Avalanche, 还是Polkadot， 似乎IBC已经赢得了这场多链的战争（interchain 而非multichain)。而IBC作为核心，其上的设计框架以及代币标准也可以进行共享，所以Cosmos是一种真正开放的，chain agnostic的可互操作性的协议，其很好的阐述了去中心化的真正含义。同时我们看到各种主流的可信跨链\n\nAxelar、LayerZero、Wormhole 和 Composable Finance 等通信协议也是也在从各种维度整合 进入IBC - 采用数据标准(Wormhole计划与Osmosis合作将Solana引入Cosmos生态）或使用 IBC 作为传输层（LayerZero）。对于这块感兴趣的朋友可以看我们的文章谁将成为跨链通讯协议标准？IBC vs LayerZero vs Axelar vs Wormhole ?。我们相信，Cosmos主导的多链时代已经到来。", "timestamp": 1657381528, "digest": "5TaG1uwM_DivhU-2BpY_DRENmx5mmhdMYgr_4IDMeDM", "contributor": "0xf1E26c020a084E77A4931fEE4c997a2b064566fc"}

{"id": "KjPHYo-QUKcv6zL4yYLKADjCqKNejH8T8gNeSbvnqLk", "title": "GameFi: The Early Days", "body": "## Gaming of today\n\nGaming is an economic powerhouse industry. Both the sales data and industry experts will highlight the importance of the gaming market in the entertainment space today.  Many analytics firms are projecting continued [robust gaming growth](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/01/26/2373258/0/en/Gaming-Market-Size-USD-177-8-Billion-in-2020-and-Expected-to-Expand-Further-at-8-6-CAGR-Still-2030-Report-by-Market-Research-Future-MRFR.html) through the end of the decade (2030).\n\nHowever, many of today’s games and game economies are silo’d by the game studio and do not monetarily reward the actual player or gamer for their time. Players put money into a game and the money (or player’s time/value) stays in the game. Game studios develop the game, then extract all future value from the player or community. No monetary value or items are allowed to leave the game economy/ecosystem.\n\nThis gives the game studio full control over the economy, which is beneficial for monetary policy and governance but leaves players without financial incentive. Thus to date, players have interacted with games with the mindset of entertainment only.\n\n## Gaming of tomorrow\n\nThe question becomes: Is play-to-earn (P2E) possible? With cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, I believe it is possible.\n\n*Note: I think “play” is a misleading word, because it insinuates “fun”, “casual”, or even “relaxed” ways to make money when playing a game. While this might be true for some games, most “games” are going to have unique “play” mechanics for which players earn or are rewarded financially. I think the better terminology for web3 users is “perform”-to-earn.*\n\n[Anthony Lee Zhang](https://twitter.com/AnthonyLeeZhang) has a great [paper](https://anthonyleezhang.substack.com/p/the-market-for-promises?s=w) explaining the new financial trust that blockchains enable market participants to have with each other. This new financial trust enables the monetization of time spent online (i.e., actions on-chain) without the need of a centralized authority moderating activity. In other words, blockchains and smart contracts allow for automated game economies to be constructed without a centralized authority governing. The code (smart contracts) is governing. And people can be financially rewarded for their actions and time spent on a blockchain.\n\nSo how do we unlock this financial reward? There are three parts to unlocking GameFi: 1) fungible tokens, 2) non-fungible tokens, and 3) on-chain game logic (i.e., smart contract’s rules for all players).\n\n### Unlocking P2E: Part 1 - Fungible tokens\n\nSimply put, cryptocurrency (fungible tokens) allows for any game studio to create an open game economy with the broader crypto world, if they so choose. Launch a token, provide initial liquidity on a DEX, and voilà, the game economy (token) is now able to be purchased and traded by the masses (e.g., [ApeCoin, APE](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/apecoin)). More importantly, the tokens enable the game studio to raise funds, reward the early community members, and create a play-to-earn mechanic.\n\n![ApeCoin (APE) was launched in March 2022 in partnership with Animoca Brands, Yuga Labs, and others to bootstrap multiple initiatives.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9L8AcJEUBTNXs7LvQtyty.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\nWhile launching a token for a game can help bootstrap a game studio’s treasury and assist in community building, game studios are at the mercy of the market valuing the game’s token. Solutions for “token sell pressure” arose, such as “ve”, staking, or bonding, to help stabilize token prices for ‘x’ time duration. Token price stabilization can provide more confidence in the development team and the game’s future economy. However, once a token’s emissions schedule is announced and set, it becomes increasingly hard to redesign and relaunch without losing faith in the community and investors at large.\n\n[Token design](https://metaportal.substack.com/p/managing-crypto-gaming-economies) is NOT easy whether it’s for a game or a protocol!\n\nWith all that said, fungible tokens are required to enable an open economy. They are part 1 in unlocking GameFi.\n\n### Unlocking P2E: Part 2 - Non-Fungible tokens (NFTs)\n\nIn 2021, NFTs caught the world by storm. People began to have a new understanding of NFTs, what they can represent, and how they can be applied in communities and gaming. In a blockchain game, game studios can now represent a 1/1 asset as an NFT ([ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) or [ERC-1155](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/)) and have a fungible token ([ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)) be the currency of the game world.\n\nNow, game studios have the two necessary pieces to a game: NFTs, or 1/1 items, and fungible tokens, the game’s currency or store of value. With NFTs and fungible tokens, native digital trade and commerce can occur, not only token speculation.\n\nNFTs, or 1/1 ownable objects, are the second key unlock for a game economy.\n\n\\[Side note: shout out to the [Double Protocol team](https://twitter.com/DoubleProtocol) for creating [rental NFTs](https://medium.com/double-protocol/3-steps-of-making-nfts-rentable-1-8d8f82485706) with the [ERC-4907 standard](https://t.co/gMOwgKVdI1). This adds another tool to the game developers’ toolbox when creating game objects and incentive loops.

The game logic and rules must facilitate all gamers playing with **an opportunity** to enjoy him/herself. Ideally, the game logic allows players to hit flow channels by providing challenging, yet achievable gameplay as a player’s skills improve.\n\nFlow channels are essential to a game being fun! Flow channel theory is important to game design because flow channels are [defined](https://gamejolt.com/p/understanding-the-flow-channel-in-game-design-an-important-aspect-ghuttxg6) as “the state of mind that keeps a person focused on an activity.”\n\nWhen you think about fun games, consider flow channels. Using the [diagram](http://indiedevstories.com/2011/08/10/game-theory-applied-the-flow-channel/) below, let’s assume a new player starts at Point *A1*. Depending on the player’s skills, the gameplay could send our player to Point *A2* or *A3*. Let’s walk through the scenarios:\n\n* *A1* to *A2*: our player is skillful and is easily progressing through the game’s obstacles and challenges. If this flow state persists too long for our player, our player will remain in the “Boredom” zone.\n* *A1* to *A3*: our player’s skills are not good enough. Our player experiences “Anxiety” because they are unable to accomplish the quest or in-game task at their present skill level. Our player might have to attempt the challenge many times before they are able to progress in the game and move to *A4*.\n\n![Flow Channel States, \"The Art of Game Design\" by Jesse Schell](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aZK8QPoyA3W3fhRJYp7_z.png?height=680&width=1300)\n\nGenerally for a game to be fun, it needs to keep a player progressing through these flow channel loops at a reasonable rate.\n\nThis is why I am personally bullish on both centralized games and decentralized games succeeding in the game design space. It will not be exclusively dominated by one or the other. Centralized game studios can provide high-quality game loops, and well-structured, storyline franchises for gamers; while, decentralized games can provide a high-quality community, game experimentation, and GameFi “lego-blocks” that are interoperable and composable. A good example of a centralized game (and economy) would be [Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home). A good example of a decentralized community game would be the [loot project](https://www.lootproject.com/) (and the expansion [Loot Realms](https://bibliothecadao.xyz/)).\n\n## Why is GameFi early?\n\nGameFi is early because most of us in web3 are still playing PvP games against each other. The game rules (Part 3) have not been defined or designed by a game studio, DAO, or protocol to create a “fun” GameFi experience for all participants in a coordinated way.\n\nAlas, today, GameFi is more PvP and less P2E.\n\nAnd this is not to put fault on game studios or game developers. It is likely more crypto tools, infrastructure, and development are needed before the world experiences transformational GameFi operations.\n\n*Note: I’m of the opinion that crypto, generally, is the biggest PvP game that exists. As of July 2022, crypto’s rules are primarily defined by the Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols (Proof of Work and Proof of Stake). Cryptocurrency rules might change and morph over time; but at the moment, Bitcoin and Ethereum’s code (or rules) are determining how most users are incentivized to \"play\" on L1 blockchains.*\n\n### Today’s Games: PvP\n\nToday, many crypto games launched are PvP games or zero-sum games - to win, someone else must lose. According to [Jordi Alexander](https://twitter.com/gametheorizing) in the article [“Of Smoke and Mirrors, Part 1”](https://medium.com/@game_theorizing/of-smoke-and-mirrors-part-1-117c1f92e186), this should not come as a surprise:\n\n> “Pooled resource games are as old as history, evolving over the centuries to tap more and more effectively into the base needs we Homo Sapiens are wired with: The desire to make it. To belong to a community. And to be a part of something larger than ourselves.”\n\n![\"A Bold Bluff\": Dogs playing poker](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cfRR5vz3LEXOjIyArksqJ.png?height=666&width=1001)\n\nWhile pooled resource games (or PvP games) are fun and they create lasting communities (i.e., poker), they do not get gamers toward an MMO world, which is what many people imagine when they consider P2E (or GameFi).\n\n[“Of Smoke and Mirrors, Part 1”](https://medium.com/@game_theorizing/of-smoke-and-mirrors-part-1-117c1f92e186) outlines the fundamental principles and pitfalls of ponzi games designed and launched in 2021. Essentially, crypto ponzis games can be spun up quickly, are usually shrouded in complexity or generalities, and tend to be extremely predatory. Designing long-term game incentives with positive community network effects is difficult.\n\nAnother take-home point from “Of Smoke and Mirrors” is opening up a game economy to the broad crypto economy (i.e., trading pair on a DEX) subjects said game economy to mercenary players and capital. According to traditional economic assumptions, players (or firms) will be profit maximalists, and if the game rules (Part 3) allow for value extraction, then it will likely happen. Open game economies will be subjected to similar problems faced by nation-states when constructing monetary policy. A game economy’s token needs value accrual so that foreign exchange (FX) occurs in both ways. In other words, money enters the game economy at a greater rate than it leaves (ideally!).\n\nPvP games will continue to dominate the “GameFi” space until game economies incentivize players to play coordinated games.\n\n### Tomorrow’s Games: Thoughtful tokeneconomics\n\n[Luffistotle](https://twitter.com/luffistotle), researcher and investor at [ZeePrime Capital](https://zeeprime.capital/), discusses how project teams can optimize rewarding their communities with better [airdrop and token design mechanics](https://zeeprime.capital/improving-community-distribution/). One example from the article suggests that a protocol or game could design a continuous reward mechanism based on a game KPI or community KPI. This way early contributors are not the only ones rewarded and late entrants do not feel like they “missed the boat”.\n\nDesigning thoughtful token emissions and inflation schedules is essential to migrating from PvP to P2E. With improved tokeneconomics, game studios will be able to better align their community with the long-term success of the game and its economy.\n\nEach game genre will likely need to design and experiment with tokeneconomic parameters based on the games’ desired incentive (reward) loops. Tokeneconomics is not a copy pasta type of activity. P2E games will have different incentive loops than PvP.\n\nP2E is effectively looking to define what “work” in a game can be monetarily rewarded in web3 in perpetuity.\n\n### Tomorrow’s Games: Strongly on-chain\n\nBased on a game’s design requirements and purpose, “GameFi” will evolve to encompass a full spectrum of on-chain games. To this point, [aaaaaaaaaa](https://twitter.com/3pa15) categorizes on-chain gaming in the [“Thoughts on on-chain gaming”](https://dialectic.ch/editorial/thoughts-on-chain-gaming) as either “strongly on-chain” or “weakly on-chain”. Not all on-chain games are not equal. There are trade-offs (see table below) for the gamer, game developer, the monetization model, and the game’s UI/UX depending on the game’s on-chain requirements.\n\n![Strengths and Weaknesses of on-chain games from \"Thoughts on on-chain gaming\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KWtD8_jivsI6VoyaloSqE.png?height=787&width=1517)\n\nMost games today are developed and owned in totality by the game studio. The game studio rents/owns the servers the game is played on, owns the game assets, and controls the game’s token. Players are paying the game studio for the usage of game assets, and players are at the whim of the game studio’s monetary policy. Additionally, if the game studio folds or decides to unplug the servers, *poof*, the game assets, achievements, and collateral put into the game is gone.\n\nWith strongly on-chain games, this *poof* scenario is less likely (or impossible). Strongly on-chain games are persistent because the assets, game logic, and game state are stored on-chain. To support this claim, [Will Robinson](https://twitter.com/DangerWillRobin), co-Founder of [dfdao](https://twitter.com/d_fdao) (Dark Forest DAO), [tweeted](https://twitter.com/DangerWillRobin/status/1544335966189543426) that on-chain games have the entire game logic and game state on-chain; while, animations, other graphics, shapes, sounds, etc. can be left off-chain on the client-side. By storing the entire game logic and game state on-chain, players are able to trust the game’s state to the extent that they are able to trust the consensus/settlement layer. [Dark Forest](https://arena.dfdao.xyz/) is built on Ethereum, thus, the game’s logic and state are subject to Ethereum’s security, which is great!\n\n![Dark Forest gameplay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ubVAInlIjOqcyo35cJkFy.png?height=998&width=2024)\n\nIn the coming years, game studios and development teams will likely continue to experiment with the percentage of game logic and states put on-chain as teams look to strike a balance between the pros and cons of strongly and weakly on-chain games.\n\n### Tomorrow’s Games: from PvP to P2E\n\nHow does crypto move more to P2E? Tokens exist, NFTs exist, and game designers are thinking about GameFi. However, putting it all together is a monumental feat. And a game’s on-chain requirements will dramatically change the game economy design and determine if the game is more web3 or a hybrid web2.5-type game.\n\nIf a game is going to qualify as a trustless, P2E game, the financial components must be on-chain. Moreover, it is likely that all inputs that contribute to the financial outcome will likewise need to be submitted on-chain. This reiterates Will Robinson’s point that the entire game logic (remember Part 3: the rules) and game state will need to be on-chain for full GameFi eligibility. Otherwise, there will be a centralized party that gamers must trust to facilitate money movement and financial outcomes.\n\nThis transition to GameFi will happen over years, not weeks or months. The most difficult part of GameFi will be the “Fi” part, or the game’s automated token economy and governing rules.\n\n### NFT Metagames: A GameFi game?\n\nNFTs exploded in popularity and speculation in 2021. NFT project founders and community members recognized the value of aggregating web3 people into groups through NFT collections. Thus, NFT networks found success by aggregating talent, “alpha” information, amazing content creation, and resources and capital from people who had joined the NFT community.\n\nI suggest that NFTFi (or SocialFi) is the concept that an individual or group can capture value from the network(s) or brands that they are a part of through NFT ownership. By holding a 1/1 NFT from a collection, a web3 player now has exclusive access to online content, games, information, merchandise, and IRL events that non-NFT holders are excluded from. This NFT metagame has created enough FOMO and speculation that hundreds of thousands of dollars were invested into NFT projects and communities across numerous blockchains.\n\n![@DeezeFi Twitter banner, which showcases NFTs from multiple NFT collections](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tF0o7XbJikG-0q93Yxyma.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nArguably, NFTFi could be considered one of the first, global on-chain iterations of a GameFi game. Why? Because it passes the necessary unlocks of P2E outlined above:\n\n* Part 1 - Fungible tokens: ETH (or SOL) is the fungible token used by the game.\n* Part 2 - NFTs: NFTs are at the heart of this game. NFTs represent 1/1 personas, exclusive access, or membership to a community.\n* Part 3 - Rules: The rules are simple. To join, one must own an NFT. Additionally, all NFT transactions and authentications occur on-chain making NFTFi a strongly on-chain game.\n\nNFTs became the shelling point for web3 players to join new groups and networks to find connections and value (that could lead to new opportunities). Is this not the same thing that clubs or professional societies promise?\n\nWhile the NFT metagame saw many pump-n-dumps, scams, and cash grabs, the NFT metagame launched legitimate projects, networks, and media content that will likely survive the bear market of 2022. There are potential lindy effects for these NFT networks and brands that survive the bear market. To date, NFTFi has primarily been evaluated by NFT community floor prices, but I anticipate more complex metrics to develop as NFT networks continue to grow and produce goods and services.\n\nStretching the imagination a bit further, one can foresee a future where NFT communities coordinate at higher levels to drive more value to their digital community (or its underlying blockchain) rather than to a nation-state economy.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nI think it has been extremely positive to have had the amount of bubbly excitement around GameFi, even if it’s early. Identifying how transformative GameFi will be to crypto and the larger crypto market has been beneficial as investors and teams focus on what to build in the upcoming months and years. GameFi will now be a focus area of investor speculation, game development, and user-generated value creation for the rest of the decade. When combining it all - fungible tokens, NFTs, and game design/rules - I believe GameFi will redefine societies, nation-states, and how humans coordinate on a community and global scale!\n\nBlockchain researchers and developers are still working on scaling blockchains for everyday usage, let alone on-chain gaming requirements. Games cannot be strongly on-chain if the blockchain’s transactions-per-second (TPS) is not ready for gaming mass adoption. Game development and GameFi experimentation will continue to occur as blockchains evaluate and deploy scaling solutions. Some teams working on scaling GameFi capabilities are Starknet, Polygon, and Avalanche.\n\nGameFi introduces a new set of opportunities on how the world is incentivized and designed because game designers will be able to create novel reward mechanics to reward on-chain actions, which in turn can reward a human in the meatspace. I’d speculate that robust GameFi economies are about two to three years (2024-2025) away from mainstream adoption, political movements, and economic disruption.\n\nThank you for reading this research piece on GameFi.

{"id": "bt24nyVakqcEdORWzz3DDMWO-tb6tgFBfCIXFnh-C1c", "title": "GameFi: The Early Days", "body": "## Gaming of today\n\nGaming is an economic powerhouse industry. Both the sales data and industry experts will highlight the importance of the gaming market in the entertainment space today.  Many analytics firms are projecting continued [robust gaming growth](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/01/26/2373258/0/en/Gaming-Market-Size-USD-177-8-Billion-in-2020-and-Expected-to-Expand-Further-at-8-6-CAGR-Still-2030-Report-by-Market-Research-Future-MRFR.html) through the end of the decade (2030).\n\nHowever, many of today’s games and game economies are silo’d by the game studio and do not monetarily reward the actual player or gamer for their time. Players put money into a game and the money (or player’s time/value) stays in the game. Game studios develop the game, then extract all future value from the player or community. No monetary value or items are allowed to leave the game economy/ecosystem.\n\nThis gives the game studio full control over the economy, which is beneficial for monetary policy and governance but leaves players without financial incentive. Thus to date, players have interacted with games with the mindset of entertainment only.\n\n## Gaming of tomorrow\n\nThe question becomes: Is play-to-earn (P2E) possible? With cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, I believe it is possible.\n\n*Note: I think “play” is a misleading word, because it insinuates “fun”, “casual”, or even “relaxed” ways to make money when playing a game. While this might be true for some games, most “games” are going to have unique “play” mechanics for which players earn or are rewarded financially. I think the better terminology for web3 users is “perform”-to-earn.*\n\n[Anthony Lee Zhang](https://twitter.com/AnthonyLeeZhang) has a great [paper](https://anthonyleezhang.substack.com/p/the-market-for-promises?s=w) explaining the new financial trust that blockchains enable market participants to have with each other. This new financial trust enables the monetization of time spent online (i.e., actions on-chain) without the need of a centralized authority moderating activity. In other words, blockchains and smart contracts allow for automated game economies to be constructed without a centralized authority governing. The code (smart contracts) is governing. And people can be financially rewarded for their actions and time spent on a blockchain.\n\nSo how do we unlock this financial reward? There are three parts to unlocking GameFi: 1) fungible tokens, 2) non-fungible tokens, and 3) on-chain game logic (i.e., smart contract’s rules for all players).\n\n### Unlocking P2E: Part 1 - Fungible tokens\n\nSimply put, cryptocurrency (fungible tokens) allows for any game studio to create an open game economy with the broader crypto world, if they so choose. Launch a token, provide initial liquidity on a DEX, and voilà, the game economy (token) is now able to be purchased and traded by the masses (e.g., [ApeCoin, APE](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/apecoin)). More importantly, the tokens enable the game studio to raise funds, reward the early community members, and create a play-to-earn mechanic.\n\n![ApeCoin (APE) was launched in March 2022 in partnership with Animoca Brands, Yuga Labs, and others to bootstrap multiple initiatives.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9L8AcJEUBTNXs7LvQtyty.png?height=720&width=1280)\n\nWhile launching a token for a game can help bootstrap a game studio’s treasury and assist in community building, game studios are at the mercy of the market valuing the game’s token. Solutions for “token sell pressure” arose, such as “ve”, staking, or bonding, to help stabilize token prices for ‘x’ time duration. Token price stabilization can provide more confidence in the development team and the game’s future economy. However, once a token’s emissions schedule is announced and set, it becomes increasingly hard to redesign and relaunch without losing faith in the community and investors at large.\n\n[Token design](https://metaportal.substack.com/p/managing-crypto-gaming-economies) is NOT easy whether it’s for a game or a protocol!\n\nWith all that said, fungible tokens are required to enable an open economy. They are part 1 in unlocking GameFi.\n\n### Unlocking P2E: Part 2 - Non-Fungible tokens (NFTs)\n\nIn 2021, NFTs caught the world by storm. People began to have a new understanding of NFTs, what they can represent, and how they can be applied in communities and gaming. In a blockchain game, game studios can now represent a 1/1 asset as an NFT ([ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) or [ERC-1155](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/)) and have a fungible token ([ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)) be the currency of the game world.\n\nNow, game studios have the two necessary pieces to a game: NFTs, or 1/1 items, and fungible tokens, the game’s currency or store of value. With NFTs and fungible tokens, native digital trade and commerce can occur, not only token speculation.\n\nNFTs, or 1/1 ownable objects, are the second key unlock for a game economy.\n\n\\[Side note: shout out to the [Double Protocol team](https://twitter.com/DoubleProtocol) for creating [rental NFTs](https://medium.com/double-protocol/3-steps-of-making-nfts-rentable-1-8d8f82485706) with the [ERC-4907 standard](https://t.co/gMOwgKVdI1).

This way early contributors are not the only ones rewarded and late entrants do not feel like they “missed the boat”.\n\nDesigning thoughtful token emissions and inflation schedules is essential to migrating from PvP to P2E. With improved tokeneconomics, game studios will be able to better align their community with the long-term success of the game and its economy.\n\nEach game genre will likely need to design and experiment with tokeneconomic parameters based on the games’ desired incentive (reward) loops. Tokeneconomics is not a copy pasta type of activity. P2E games will have different incentive loops than PvP.\n\nP2E is effectively looking to define what “work” in a game can be monetarily rewarded in web3 in perpetuity.\n\n### Tomorrow’s Games: Strongly on-chain\n\nBased on a game’s design requirements and purpose, “GameFi” will evolve to encompass a full spectrum of on-chain games. To this point, [aaaaaaaaaa](https://twitter.com/3pa15) categorizes on-chain gaming in the [“Thoughts on on-chain gaming”](https://dialectic.ch/editorial/thoughts-on-chain-gaming) as either “strongly on-chain” or “weakly on-chain”. Not all on-chain games are not equal. There are trade-offs (see table below) for the gamer, game developer, the monetization model, and the game’s UI/UX depending on the game’s on-chain requirements.\n\n![Strengths and Weaknesses of on-chain games from \"Thoughts on on-chain gaming\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KWtD8_jivsI6VoyaloSqE.png?height=787&width=1517)\n\nMost games today are developed and owned in totality by the game studio. The game studio rents/owns the servers the game is played on, owns the game assets, and controls the game’s token. Players are paying the game studio for the usage of game assets, and players are at the whim of the game studio’s monetary policy. Additionally, if the game studio folds or decides to unplug the servers, *poof*, the game assets, achievements, and collateral put into the game is gone.\n\nWith strongly on-chain games, this *poof* scenario is less likely (or impossible). Strongly on-chain games are persistent because the assets, game logic, and game state are stored on-chain. To support this claim, [Will Robinson](https://twitter.com/DangerWillRobin), co-Founder of [dfdao](https://twitter.com/d_fdao) (Dark Forest DAO), [tweeted](https://twitter.com/DangerWillRobin/status/1544335966189543426) that on-chain games have the entire game logic and game state on-chain; while, animations, other graphics, shapes, sounds, etc. can be left off-chain on the client-side. By storing the entire game logic and game state on-chain, players are able to trust the game’s state to the extent that they are able to trust the consensus/settlement layer. [Dark Forest](https://arena.dfdao.xyz/) is built on Ethereum, thus, the game’s logic and state are subject to Ethereum’s security, which is great!\n\n![Dark Forest gameplay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ubVAInlIjOqcyo35cJkFy.png?height=998&width=2024)\n\nIn the coming years, game studios and development teams will likely continue to experiment with the percentage of game logic and states put on-chain as teams look to strike a balance between the pros and cons of strongly and weakly on-chain games.\n\n### Tomorrow’s Games: from PvP to P2E\n\nHow does crypto move more to P2E? Tokens exist, NFTs exist, and game designers are thinking about GameFi. However, putting it all together is a monumental feat. And a game’s on-chain requirements will dramatically change the game economy design and determine if the game is more web3 or a hybrid web2.5-type game.\n\nIf a game is going to qualify as a trustless, P2E game, the financial components must be on-chain. Moreover, it is likely that all inputs that contribute to the financial outcome will likewise need to be submitted on-chain. This reiterates Will Robinson’s point that the entire game logic (remember Part 3: the rules) and game state will need to be on-chain for full GameFi eligibility. Otherwise, there will be a centralized party that gamers must trust to facilitate money movement and financial outcomes.\n\nThis transition to GameFi will happen over years, not weeks or months. The most difficult part of GameFi will be the “Fi” part, or the game’s automated token economy and governing rules.\n\n### NFT Metagames: A GameFi game?\n\nNFTs exploded in popularity and speculation in 2021. NFT project founders and community members recognized the value of aggregating web3 people into groups through NFT collections. Thus, NFT networks found success by aggregating talent, “alpha” information, amazing content creation, and resources and capital from people who had joined the NFT community.\n\nI suggest that NFTFi (or SocialFi) is the concept that an individual or group can capture value from the network(s) or brands that they are a part of through NFT ownership. By holding a 1/1 NFT from a collection, a web3 player now has exclusive access to online content, games, information, merchandise, and IRL events that non-NFT holders are excluded from. This NFT metagame has created enough FOMO and speculation that hundreds of thousands of dollars were invested into NFT projects and communities across numerous blockchains.\n\n![@DeezeFi Twitter banner, which showcases NFTs from multiple NFT collections](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tF0o7XbJikG-0q93Yxyma.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nArguably, NFTFi could be considered one of the first, global on-chain iterations of a GameFi game. Why? Because it passes the necessary unlocks of P2E outlined above:\n\n* Part 1 - Fungible tokens: ETH (or SOL) is the fungible token used by the game.\n* Part 2 - NFTs: NFTs are at the heart of this game. NFTs represent 1/1 personas, exclusive access, or membership to a community.\n* Part 3 - Rules: The rules are simple. To join, one must own an NFT. Additionally, all NFT transactions and authentications occur on-chain making NFTFi a strongly on-chain game.\n\nNFTs became the shelling point for web3 players to join new groups and networks to find connections and value (that could lead to new opportunities). Is this not the same thing that clubs or professional societies promise?\n\nWhile the NFT metagame saw many pump-n-dumps, scams, and cash grabs, the NFT metagame launched legitimate projects, networks, and media content that will likely survive the bear market of 2022. There are potential lindy effects for these NFT networks and brands that survive the bear market. To date, NFTFi has primarily been evaluated by NFT community floor prices, but I anticipate more complex metrics to develop as NFT networks continue to grow and produce goods and services.\n\nStretching the imagination a bit further, one can foresee a future where NFT communities coordinate at higher levels to drive more value to their digital community (or its underlying blockchain) rather than to a nation-state economy.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nI think it has been extremely positive to have had the amount of bubbly excitement around GameFi, even if it’s early. Identifying how transformative GameFi will be to crypto and the larger crypto market has been beneficial as investors and teams focus on what to build in the upcoming months and years. GameFi will now be a focus area of investor speculation, game development, and user-generated value creation for the rest of the decade. When combining it all - fungible tokens, NFTs, and game design/rules - I believe GameFi will redefine societies, nation-states, and how humans coordinate on a community and global scale!\n\nBlockchain researchers and developers are still working on scaling blockchains for everyday usage, let alone on-chain gaming requirements. Games cannot be strongly on-chain if the blockchain’s transactions-per-second (TPS) is not ready for gaming mass adoption. Game development and GameFi experimentation will continue to occur as blockchains evaluate and deploy scaling solutions. Some teams working on scaling GameFi capabilities are Starknet, Polygon, and Avalanche.\n\nGameFi introduces a new set of opportunities on how the world is incentivized and designed because game designers will be able to create novel reward mechanics to reward on-chain actions, which in turn can reward a human in the meatspace. I’d speculate that robust GameFi economies are about two to three years (2024-2025) away from mainstream adoption, political movements, and economic disruption.\n\nThank you for reading this research piece on GameFi. The best part of research is hearing the thoughts of others. Please reach out to me, [@ryguy_eth](https://twitter.com/ryguy_eth), if you have additional thoughts or considerations about GameFi.", "timestamp": 1657382638, "digest": "JVcU6m1JnWwF6DiaX091lH9KQRHS6HLfQHO4bK1VRmM", "contributor": "0x4226A2a1b9893c3db1a4F26EE0DEF2A820575382"}
{"id": "pgHR_SgwVj_AajGK5kUroPTT8N7bI75K21JjGjVhWdA", "title": "Cosmos 技术原理，设计框架以及生态全览", "body": "## 总览\n\n在Vitalik最新的endgame中提到，由于以太坊的扩展性问题以及持续的高需求，以太坊正在从L1 Centric的路径转向Rollups Centric的生态，这将重点牢牢放在了去年爆发的新生L2生态系统上。对于L2感兴趣的朋友，可以看我们之前的文章Rollups 最新技术进展- 论dYdX摒弃StarkWare加入Cosmos之迷以及Rollups 是全球化的唯一解决方案？详解Optimistic Rollups技术和设计原理。尽管单片链从一定程度上解决了以太坊上的state boat问题，比如低交易手续费，以及快速交易等问题，但是却牺牲了安全以及去中心化程度。区块链已经逐步从单片链演变为模块化区块链，对于这个话题感兴趣的同学，可以看我们之前的文章区块链设计演变之路，详细介绍了不同区块链的设计原理，以及安全性解决方案。我们认为目前多链枢纽的简单设计，模块化组件，更灵活的设计空间和水平扩展的能力解决了目前区块链领域的一些核心问题。而本文将着重介绍Cosmos，可以理解为搭建各种区块链的核心框架。而相较于Layer2, Cosmos则采用了完全不同的设计框架。这是形成Layer2以及应用链相互补充格局的关键差异化因素和机会。当然，总目标市场是一定的，L2的繁荣必将分流一部分Cosmos应用链的市场，减少选择搭建Cosmos应用链的数量。然而dYdX的迁移让我们相信市场正在逐步意识到Cosmos模块化和渐进去中心化的重要性。如果EVM强调的是可编程性以及可组合性，那么Cosmos则更看重主权性以及互操作性 （而Evmos强调可编程的可互操作性）。当然，总目标市场是一定的，L2的繁荣必将分流一部分Cosmos应用链的市场，减少选择搭建Cosmos应用链的数量。然而dYdX的迁移让我们相信市场正在逐步意识到Cosmos框架提供的模块化和渐进去中心化的重要性。\n\nCosmos的技术框架可以分为共识层，网络层和应用层。Cosmos对于这些不同层进行模块化，同时开发者可以根据用户需求提供可定制化。这里有几个概念再次解释下，Tendermint，可以理解为共识引擎和BFT共识算法。搭建在其上的应用链可以使用任何语言，本质上可以将其理解为将网络层和公式层组合成的通用引擎。Cosmos SDK, 是一个供开发者基于Tendermint轻松部署的模块化框架，开发者可以创建模块，也可以利用已有模块支持应用开发。ABCI可以理解为Tendermint BFT引擎与链上应用相互连接的接口。所以Cosmos的这种设计给其上搭建的应用链更多的自主权，同时通过模块化的设计为开发者提供了便捷的开发体验，从协议层到用户层都可以进行定制化部署。\n\n同时，Cosmos的设计致力于给用户带来更好的UX体验以及可互操作性。用过Osmosis的用户都知道，相比于Keplr钱包而言，用户无需手动输入通道号，而无需在不同的钱包中进行切换，大大提升了用户体验。同时，不同链之间的可互操作性也体现在不同层面，比如Cosmos的基础设施，开发工具，模块等，基于其上搭建的所有应用都可以采用；同时，dApp 可以和其他链上部署的合约实现可互操作性。而链与链之间的互通则通过IBC协议，IBC是Cosmos的灵魂，可以理解为一种允许任何Cosmos Zone之间相互操作的通用传递协议，所有应用链通过IBC协议实现EVM提供的可组合性功能的同时，每条应用链也都享有独立主权的特性。而即将上线的跨链账户（IBC TAO上的模块）和跨链安全功能，则进一步提升了资本利用率，同时为用户带来了更好的UX体验。对于跨链账户和跨链安全功能感兴趣的朋友可以看我们的文章Cosmos的开拓者 - Osmosis，继IBC之后，看ICS, ICA如何重构加密行业，这里就不详细介绍了。\n\n## Cosmos的核心理念\n\n和Polkadot, Avalanche设计理念一样，Cosmos是致力于实现水平扩展的Layer0，Layer0协议认为未来多链趋势（interchain, not multichain)将势不可挡，而Comos则提供了可扩展以及独立自主的解决方案。Cosmos打败了传统胖协议论点的概念，并将自己视为主权和独立区块链以可组合方式共存的关键基础设施。胖协议瘦应用，其实也不这么绝对，dapp应用创造了很多价值，只是被协议捕获去了，而appchain则改变这点而变成胖应用。而其完美的工程设计也吸引了大量的社区爱好者，其创新包括：实现轻松部署POS链的Tendermint引擎，实现应用层面快速部署的Cosmos SDK，IBC统一协议之上的互操作性，多种共享安全的设计机制，EVM链的入口，Gravity Bridge；CosmWasm智能合约，满足以太坊上的合约开发场景；链的进退（选择不同主权方式，消费链，应用链等）；Zone之间的天然分片，变相隔离等；当然还有性能上的考虑，比如Celestia。\n\n当然和其他单片链以及其他Layer0协议而言，Cosmos提供了模块化，可插拔的方案以及更好的可扩展性，通过对可接受交易对手安全假设动态设定点的方式实现水平扩展。这些应用链可以自主选择虚拟机，节点要求，费率模型和治理，安全假设等，所以更难被分叉；特定应用主权链相较于单片链上的应用来说，对于减少MEV攻击拥有更多的方法，并且对其上各种经济活动激励拥有更多掌控权/定价权；开发者可以根据特定应用定制/优化运行环境，而不是搭建和EVM类似的通用优化环境。开发者可以自主选择开发语言和工具。例如Cosmos SDK是用Go语言写的，其也仅仅是搭建在Tendermint上的一种方式。例如一个做比特币桥的项目Nomic，虽然它是搭建在Tendermint上，但是它利用了自己的系统，用Rust语言开发应用，而不一定需要使用支持Go语言的Cosmos SDK, 但是它仍然可以接入IBC和其他相关应用链。比如开发者可以用Gravtiy Bridge开源代码满足其不同的应用开发场景，目前Secret Network, Injective Protocol等已经采用了其分叉版本。比如像BNB这样的链，虽然是基于Cosmos SDK开发的，但是其并没有接入IBC的功能。当然IBC不仅仅支持Tendermint链，对于任何可以接入IBC 客户界面的链，包括Polkadot，以太坊，Celo都可以。所以本质上Cosmos致力于成为主权和独立区块链以可组合方式共存的关键基础设施。对于这个工程设计感兴趣的朋友，可以看我们之前的详细解读Cosmos Thesis- Osmosis应用主权链的崛起。\n\n所以应用链本质上是一种新的设计方案。相比于以太坊的设计，协议层的更新只是通用型的更新，而非针对于某个应用的更新，而在Cosmos中，协议层的更新可以创建新的功能，从而为应用链赋能。比如在Osmosis上，协议层的更新会给其核心产品AMM带来很多新功能，比如Superfliud Staking， 比如隐私，比如阈值加密，比如隐私等。Void是Cosmos上提供隐私的解决方案，致力于为大户提供私密交易以及兑换，减少MEV攻击等问题，所以一旦协议层进行部署，Osmosis上所有应用都可以享有这个功能。而在以太坊上，针对于新的功能，每个单独应用都需要独立开发，大大增加了成本，同时带来了效率低下的资源定价，MEV等问题。\n\n### 设计中的Trade off问题\n\n尽管很多支持者都认为Cosmos的设计堪称完美，但是任何设计都存在trade off，只是核心在于我们如何去最小化它。这里的trade off我们指的是缺少链间的共享安全。这意味着每条链都享有独立的安全和架构，并且需要找到安全的节点集去维护网络，以及相对稳定的币价, TVL维护安全TVL （特指Defi协议）。而每条链都提供了不同节点数量，不同节点间的质押分布，代币分布，市值，从而风险以及去中心化程度也不尽相同。\n\n这意味着，如果一条IBC链需要连接另一条IBC链，那么需要考虑其风险以及安全假设。比如一条链受到攻击或者破坏了，那么其原生资产在其连接链上的合成资产也将变得一文不值。比如Terra的灭门事件中，Luna和UST大幅跳水后，其在Osmosis上的对应资产也就没有任何价值了。当然这是潜在的风险。但是从另一个角度思考，对于在Cosmos上搭建的应用链来说，往往具备相当高的门槛，前置的overheads,比如通过网络手续费以及通胀奖励激励的验证节点，以及维持TVL的稳定币价（币价，TVL，以及网络安全的问题我们之前文章中有解释过），当然还有固定的运营成本，而Terra也曾是Cosmos最为安全的链。所以这种风险的确无法避免，但是我们看到在Terra事件中，尽管Osmosis受到了很大影响，其很多的流动性池中都有UST，LUNA的资产导致TVL大幅下跌，从8.7亿美金到1.6亿美金（by Defi Llama at the time of writing)，币价也是一跌再跌, 人们为了退出UST和LUNA头寸，导致流动性池的另一边资产OSMO的价格也大幅跳水。然而Osmosis仍然正常工作，并且正常生产区块。而Cosmos上其他依赖于UST作为稳定币的生态也是遭受了重创。同样的，如果用户将资产从一条链发送到另一条链，那么资产也会受到目的地链的安全假设影响。比如用户将Atom从Cosmos Hub发送到Evmos网络，那么Atom会受制于Evmos的风险及安全假设（其五大节点掌控37%的算力，一般超过33.33%就需要警惕了）。所以Cosmos上每条链都有不同的安全假设。Cosmos的设计最小化了两个相互连接链的安全假设的”Blast Radius，所以尽管相互连接链会受到对方的安全影响，但是整个生态Cosmos屹立不倒。\n\n### 共享安全解决方案\n\n接下来我们为大家介绍三种共享安全解决方案。而图中主要阐述的是跨链安全(Interchain Security)和Interflui staking。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-LT8pBrPGavmVE5e7UbA-.png?height=645&width=1080)\n\n1） 第一种是跨链安全，跨链安全的服务对象是所有基于Cosmos SDK搭建的链, 而Cosmos Hub, 也就是Atom 质押者可以提供此功能。消费链，通常从Cosmos Hub的节点处借用安全的方式获得共享安全，可以理解为Atom质押者在维护Cosmos Hub安全的同时，也需要参与消费链的验证。而这种方式也会让Atom持有者在帮助维护其他新网络的同时，也会有额外的奖励（当然风险是如果新的网络被攻击了，那么质押代币也会有被Slash的风险）。跨链安全主要有三个版本，第一个版本是消费链享有Cosmos Hub的全部安全性，所以网络的安全取决于Cosmos Hub的安全。上线时间预计在Q3，2022。第一个版本不适合相对成熟的应用链, 目前计划接入的有Quicksliver以及Neutron等。第二个版本称为部分安全，应用链在享有Cosmos Hub安全的同时，也可以通过其自身的验证节点以及代币维护网络安全。我们认为像Osmsosis, Axelar这样的链会选择接入，计划上线时间在Q4,2022。和第一个版本中不一样，第一个版本中的消费链代币只用于治理功能，而在这个版本中，其质押代币可以和Atom质押代币同时维护网络的安全。而在V3版本中，Hub验证节点可以有权停止验证哪条链。第二，三个版本相较于第一个版本，网络安全将最终取决于消费链和供应链共同的安全。而对于Cosmos Hub的部分参与的节点来说，如果消费链上的唯一验证节点恶意进行攻击，会有女巫攻击的可能性。对这块感兴趣的朋友可以看我们之前的Cosmos的开拓者 - Osmosis，继IBC之后，看ICS, ICA如何重构加密行业 一文。\n\n当然这个解决方案中，我们认为其设计体现了去中心化的魅力，没有任何一个老大，任何老大出问题都不会对生态产生影响。红军大说之前在我们CFG社群中有提过，Cosmos Hub和其他所有新的Hub，比如Osmosis之间的对比\n\n* 大家都是一样的Hub，可以理解为都是高速公路\n* Cosmos Hub因为是第一条， 所以大家默认更赋能， 比如目前的共享安全是专为Cosmos Hub定制的\n* 当然，Cosmos Hub还有ATOM\n* 以后Osmosis Hub可不可以也推出共享安全？我觉得完全可以， 甚至都不用经过Cosmos生态的投票， 只要自己的zone喜欢就可以了， 以后其他新的消费链可以挂在Osmosis Hub上\n* 所以， Hub都是一样的， 几乎没有区别。都是高铁， 生意好的可以做豪华高铁， 生意不好的就绿皮车。” 我觉得在理。\n\n2）Celestia 为Rollups提供的共享安全性\n\nCelestia的服务对象分为以太坊上的Rollups以及Cosmos 上的Rollups，而Celestia本质上是一个数据可用层。对于像Celestia上原生的Rollups比如Cevmos，采用了Evmos 的结算层，以及Celestia的数据可见层。而Celestia也会相继接入各种执行环境，比如Optimsitic Rollups， Substract， Cosmos SDK，以及zk-rollups 等。我们之前也出过两篇文章。\n\n3）Osmosis的Interfluid staking\n\n在这种设计中，Cosmos SDK链的共享安全是通过Osmos上的LP池子获得的， Osmosis 将允许通过 Interfluid Staking 实现另一种形式的共享安全性。Interfluid Staking 允许 Osmosis 能允许流动资金池的资产质押在原生链上。比如在OSMO-SCRT LP 对，LP 对中的 SCRT 可以通过 IBC 传输并质押在Secret 网络上。当然LP 代币也会发生变化。所以通过这种方式，流动性池子中的LP仓位也可以参与网络的安全维护，而这个也主要受益于IBC以及其跨链转账，跨链账户等模块的设计。Superfluid staking已经上线，其中交易对中必须要有OSMO，目前OSMO验证节点参与维护另一条链的安全，而Interfliud staking，交易对中无需有OMO,计划于2022年Q4上线。所以对于应用链来说，通过在OSMO提供流动性的方式，进一步提升了他们网络的安全（激活了更多没有被有效利用的LP仓位）。而对于LP来说，其除了可以获得LP的费用（交易费，激励费用）以外，也能通过额外提供网络安全而获得质押费用。\n\n## 生态简介\n\n根据MapofZone (Mintscan), 我们根据Cosmos Hub选取了交易量最高的几条链做介绍。\n\n### Osmosis\n\nOsmosis 是一条专注于创建 Cosmos 的 DeFi 中心的应用链，其占据了整个IBC交易量的90%以上，毋庸置疑是Cosmos流动性之源泉。Cosmos生态的参与者如果要进行交易Cosmos SDK资产或者CW20资产，他们不得不通过Osmosis的DEX进行交易。AMM支持的DEX是Osmosis的核心产品，并且其提供用户可交互的多种流动性池子，核心产品上其拥有许可的智能合约功能，任何给其核心产品带来价值的应用都可以在治理通过之后，在其上搭建。目前Osmosis正在积极拓展其生态，通过Osmosis Open Grants (CFG labs 是Osmosis Grants目前在亚洲唯一支持的团队）等活动奖励在其上搭建的各种开发者和项目，并且在Terra事件之后，快速拉拢了大量原Terra生态的开发者，我们也接触了很多这领域的一手项目。尽管Terra的结局并不太好，但的确为行业也带来很多优秀的开发者。目前在Osmosis上搭建的项目，包括借贷协议，杠杆协议，合成资产，隐私保护等。除此以外，Osmosis的所有资产和流动性也可以通过代币转账以及跨链账户等IBC功能，与其他链进行交互。\n\n目前Osmosis 主要有两种前端\n\n● 主前端包含了经过治理批准的官方池，通常通过 OSMO 进行激励。所有桥接的 ERC-20 资产都是 Axelar 规范版本，因为它是治理通过的主要桥服务提供商。\n\n● 前沿版本包含了主前端中的所有池和未经治理许可的池，而未经许治理许可的池子无法获得OSMO 激励（可以有外部激励，通过 Dexmos工具查看）。同时包含任意桥接资产以及 CW-20 代币。多个桥接资产意味着同一资产的不同规范资产（规范资产的概念我们之前文章中也介绍过）表示。例如：g-USDC （Gravity Bridge) 和 axl-USDC Axelar) 。而不同的的规范资产之间无法相互替代，从而会导致流动性分散的问题，带来较差的用户体验。因此两个桥的设计保证了主前端给用户带来最佳用户体验的同时（只引入治理通过桥，Axlear)也始终保持了无需可的理念，任何其他桥的资产也可以在Osmosis上提供流动性。对于Osmosis上的真正无许可的Frontier 平台，代币列表新功能以及其他前沿新技术，可以查看我们之前的文章\n\nOsmosis Beyond Coinbase? 2022有哪些前沿技术和新功能。\n\n在 Osmosis 之上启动的其他值得注意的应用程序包括：\n\n● Mars：允许合约到合约借贷的借贷协议。这将取代之前原生Confio开发的借贷项目Isotonic，两者合并为Mas协议。其之前部署在 Terra，但Terra事件后，第一时间决定在Cosmos上搭建自己的应用链，而其也会在不同IBC链上部署“Outposts”，而第一个就是Osmosis。\n\n将推出拥有许多“前哨”的自己的连锁店，第一个是在 Osmosis 上。\n\n● Void Protocol：在 Osmosis 上启动的隐私应用程序，允许私人交易和掉期。它类似于以太坊上的 Tornado Cash。主要考虑到巨鲸地址的隐私保护以及MEV攻击（zkEVM)等问题。其他生态相关项目和开发工具可以查看OsmosisEcosystem。\n\n### Cosmos Hub\n\nCosmos Hub 是 PoS 链的第一个实例，它掌管着 ATOM 代币并为其他链提供公共资金(public funds）。Cosmos 上的大部分核心工具和基础设施都由 Cosmos Hub 负责，并且负责Cosmos上的协议研发。如今，许多链通过 Cosmos Hub 上的 ATOM 质押者空投代币的形式（社区中称为stakedrop）进入其多元化的社区并访问多元化的验证者集。Cosmos 枢纽是基于可信中立和 Hub 极简主义，从而确保其他链可以完全主权，并且拥有对其链的完全自主权的同时还可以通过 IBC 实现互操作性。Cosmos Hub 即将上线跨链新功能，其中包括跨链安全和 IBC 路由即服务，有助于推动整个 Cosmos 生态系统的更多发展。\n\n### Evmos\n\nEvmos 是建立在Cosmos SDK上， 通过Tendermint BFT 共识机制获取安全性的EVM兼容Layer 1 区块， 理解为Cosmos上的EVM Hub。它为那些基于EVM 的应用提供了护城河，它们不仅可以在Evmos上开发，同时能够和Cosmos 生态相兼容。ERC-20代币和Cosmos原生代币的可组合性显得至关重要，因为这样Evmos上的应用除了可以在Evmos上实现快速确认，较低的手续费以外，同时能够享受到IBC 生态的流动性， Evmos 是Cosmos生态第一条实现EVM 兼容的链，同时它可以和Cosmos 生态其他的链实现本地交互 （Cronos, Crypto.com开发在Cosmos 上 的EVM 兼容链，虽然接入了IBC 功能，但是无法实现资产交互和大规模的通道互通。所以如果说EVM 注重在可编程性以及可组合性，Cosmos强调独立主权以及可互操作性，那么Evmos则是真正的可编程的可互操作性。\n\n那么EVM有什么核心设计特点呢？第一是它的可组合性和UX，EVM多链的设计并不具有可扩展性，开发通常需要维护不同的链，从而无法专注在核心技术的开发，而Evmos只需要一次部署，就可以享有跨链间（interchain, not multichain)的优势，而应用间也可以通过IBC（无需信任）以及桥（可信任）进行链接。从用户角度，用户可以通过一个钱包管理跨链间的所有地址，而无需像使用小狐狸钱包和Keplr钱包一样需要在不同链的钱包上（不同Prefix）进行切换。第二个特征是它的Ethermint，共享安全的设计。EVM 在Cosmos上相较于在ERC20链上的一些特点比如快速确认，可组合性，模块化，低交易手续费等。同时，Evmos是发展在Cosmos上的独立主权区块链，所以可以与IBC通信上其他枢纽实现互操作性，同时也可以和其他Cosmos上智能合约框架和模块实现通信。这种互通能够实现更高阶的Defi策略，实现更高级别的互操作性。同时，Evmos上的开发者利用Ethermint模块可以选择开发自己的独立链，同时可以选择可插拔共享安全模块的功能。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ms00Rp9fjyb7mQ6IeDwCW.png?height=590&width=1080)\n\n第三个特点则是其经济模型的设计，其在EIP1559中的设计上做了改进，将燃烧的基本费用一部分一半给到开发者，一半给到矿工，让开发者，用户，质押者的利益可以实现更好地平衡。对于Evmos感兴趣的朋友可以看我们之前的文章下一个Cosmos Hub，EVM枢纽，我们也将会在之后出一些关于Evmos的深度研究。\n\n### Stargaze\n\nNFT 在 Cosmos 生态系统中相当早期，但有一些链、市场和 NFT已经开始启动。\n\nStargaze 是 Cosmos 上专注于将 NFT 市场引入 Cosmos\n\n生态系统的应用链。目前marketplace也是最近才上线，铸造功能一直就有，而且还仍然在Beta版本中，并没有正式上线。因为其接入了IBC，因而其市场可以与其他市场链上的NFT实现可互操作性。尽管其最近IBC排名呈现下滑趋势（第5到第15），但其独特的设计机制仍然值得关注（比如通过质押NFT资产可以获得区块45%的奖励）。同时我们在Solana 的逆袭之路 - SQLANA文中介绍过，Solana目前的NFT交易量仅次于排名第一️的以太坊（占据了以太坊的5%-6%），当然项目数量、独立买卖者、交易笔数等也都是非常好的衡量标准，其中较低的单价、手续费是主要原因。同时作为Solana生态上最大的交易市场玩家Magic Eden，不管从用户基数（日用户在38,000)，还是交易量都排名第一，仅次于其的分别是Solanart和Solesea (用户都在2,000-3,000) 等表现都非常出现，其也于近日宣布完成了由Electric Capital和Greylock领投的1.3亿美金的B轮融资，Solana上一直没有出现蓝筹的PFP项目。而Cosmos上的Bad Kids似乎获得很多社区支持者，比如Sunny Aggarwal （CEO of Osmosis) 等KOL就用了他们作为头像。的认可。bad Kid 总共有9999张，每个坏孩子都有一堆数据：年龄、大脑、肌肉，当然还有坏处。每个坏孩子都是坏孩子，但有些孩子甚至更坏。这些数字是根据每个孩子的艺术和稀有性生成的。您还可以了解不同组件的名称，例如眼睛、发型等。\n\n### Juno\n\nJuno 网络是Cosmos 生态中的一条专注于无需许可智能合约开发的Layer1公链，主要基于Cosmos SDK 开发，引入Tendermint BFT 共识机制来维护网络的安全。Cosmos Hub 作为Cosmos生态的”母亲”， 一直遵守着其“可信中立”以及“极简主义”的原则，因此将社区所有的智能合约开发都承载到Juno 网络，Juno 网络应运而生（这个很常见，之前Gravity DEX 也准备在Cosmos Hub 上开发，但是考虑到以上等因素，现在转移到自己的公链并且重新命名为Cresent Protocol。在Cosmos 上，所有的链都是针对于某些特定应用场景而开发的， 我们看到了Osmosis, Cosmos 生态上的最大的流动性/AMM 链，Umee, 专注在借贷领域的借贷链，Juno则是智能合约开发领域的王者，以往Cosmos 生态的开发者在Cosmos上开发，需要开发自己的Layer 1 链，现在Juno的出现大大降低了开发者们的门槛，让很多的开发者可以专注在App开发的同时享受到IBC的跨链优势。\n\n我们不得不承认Juno 网络上的应用都非常独体，基于其独特的设计框架和成功地引入了Cosmwasm智能合约框架的经验，我们看到了很多DAO 工具的出现， DAODAO 是一款让人们快速创建DAO的DAO工具，提供了很多DAO相关活动的一键完成功能，例如投票，创建，部署，参与等。同时和其他DAO 产品不一样，它还有特有的跨链功能，例如可以在Juno chain上管理Osmosis 上的账户。当然还有很多其他创新的项目。Juno 主打的是无许可部署链，而Cosmos生态其他的应用链需要通过治理来让更多的Cosmwasm 项目在他们的主链上搭建 （比如Osmosis 的治理非常活跃，几乎每天都有，他们最近也开始接入Cosmwasm，希望优质的Defi项目接入他们的生态）。对于Juno感兴趣的朋友，可以看我们的Juno 网络 - Cosmos 生态的智能合约枢纽。\n\n## 可扩展性解决方案\n\nCosmos 通过拥有许多独立的Zone进行扩展，而每条链上的扩展性扩展路线图将取决于其各自的交易活动以及历史的设计理念。比如相比于通用型的应用链（Juno), 应用链的扩展性问题相对可控（Osmosis, 其支持与其核心产品相得益彰的应用，并且需要通过治理通过）。目前应用链层面有很多可选可扩展性方案，目前Celestia致力于解决Rollups上的可扩展问题。理论上每条搭建在Tendermint上的应用链可容纳 150 个验证者，但理论上开发者拥有“无限”\n\n水平可扩展性，因为如果一个链条变得过于拥挤，开发者始终可以启动通过 IBC 互连的新链，当然trade off就是额外的安全假设。\n\n当然共识层面也开始能够提供更快的出块时间和更多的验证器集。在 Quicksilver 目前测试网中，其有 500 多个验证者，这些验证者的出块权重为 6 秒，而其他链也在试验 2 秒的出块时间 （Cosmos 目前平均出块时间为6秒，Evmos为2秒，极大的提升了区块时间），这将极大的增加可扩展性。因此，除了应用链当前可用的扩展路径之外，共识层面也在进行更改，从而实现更多可扩展性。\n\n## 潜在风险及总结\n\nCosmos 生态系统是Layer0，因此成败取决于每个单独的链。所以这才是去中心化的灵魂，没有任何一个老大，老大可以随时去死。Cosmos Hub可否去掉，Terra生态的灭亡，都没有太大的问题。这就是我们上文提到的完美设计，最小化了相互连接的独立链间安全假设的Blast Radius 爆炸半径问题。\n\n而对于Cosmos整个生态的失败，那么主要来自于竞争风险。以太坊Rollups Centric的理念会不会进一步吞噬应用链的现有市场？我们认为这种可能性比较低，和以太坊相比，Cosmos也采用了完全不一样的设计框架与理念，如果说以太坊是个帝国，那么cosmos是个联盟。虽然他们有不同的愿景、不同的文化、不同的机制，但是他们终有一战，用相得益彰或者更为恰当。\n\n而对于Cosmos 上的其他竞争对手比如Polkadot、Avalanche 或 NEAR，我们认为其缺少核心的IBC灵魂的设计，或者其只是采用了在不同共识引擎上启动EVM链，换汤不换药的做法。而我们看到这些链似乎正在加速与IBC的连接，无论是Near, Avalanche, 还是Polkadot， 似乎IBC已经赢得了这场多链的战争（interchain 而非multichain)。而IBC作为核心，其上的设计框架以及代币标准也可以进行共享，所以Cosmos是一种真正开放的，chain agnostic的可互操作性的协议，其很好的阐述了去中心化的真正含义。同时我们看到各种主流的可信跨链\n\nAxelar、LayerZero、Wormhole 和 Composable Finance 等通信协议也是也在从各种维度整合 进入IBC - 采用数据标准(Wormhole计划与Osmosis合作将Solana引入Cosmos生态）或使用 IBC 作为传输层（LayerZero）。对于这块感兴趣的朋友可以看我们的文章谁将成为跨链通讯协议标准？IBC vs LayerZero vs Axelar vs Wormhole ?。我们相信，Cosmos主导的多链时代已经到来。", "timestamp": 1657382514, "digest": "5TaG1uwM_DivhU-2BpY_DRENmx5mmhdMYgr_4IDMeDM", "contributor": "0xf1E26c020a084E77A4931fEE4c997a2b064566fc"}

规则\n\n**本项目评分由场景，产品，经济模型，运营，团队和资方，项目格局，风险7个部分构成。**\n\n**满分为100，前6个部分的对应权重分别为场景(15)，产品(20)，经济模型(20)，运营(15)，团队和资方(20)，项目格局(10)。最后的风险为减分项，无风险则无减分。**\n\n\n---\n\n# 场景（满分15 得分10）\n\n1. **高频性**：Melody的Sing-to-Earn属性，并不是生活中的每日高频活动。\n2. **正向激励性**：唱歌本身不能构成正向激励，不算一个好习惯，只能算是一件中性的事情。大多数玩家并没有花上一笔钱，下定决心培养自己每天唱歌的习惯的动机。\n3. **易传播性**：唱歌是中等易传播的活动（不如运动培养好习惯更适合分享，但也比单纯的玩游戏适合传播）\n4. **潜在用户**：较广泛，是一项全民皆宜的活动。\n5. **原创性**：强，在本项目之前没有相关场景Web3项目出现。\n\n虽然Sing-to-Earn不具备高频和正向激励属性，但由于其原创程度较高，潜在用户群体广泛，综合得分10分。\n\n\n---\n\n# 产品（满分20 得分3）\n\n这个部分争议会比较大，由于项目在不断开发，处在早期的项目会有一定劣势。所以我会取公售的时间作为取样点，公售后约半个月再次取样，进行产品分析。\n\nPs：Melody的公售盲盒时间为6月17日。\n\n1. **功能完整度**：6月17日公售时和半个月后都没有任何产品，只有mint网页平台。7月6日开盒，7月8日上线了网页的NFT质押赚币。\n2. **产品开发迭代速度**：这实际是评价产品开发的一个重要标准，但是由于Melody公售后半个月还没有更新。快一个月后只上线了质押，没有产品，该项暂时只能给最低分。\n\n总结：公售是一个游戏很重要的里程碑，代表着项目方展示自己的成果，用户为项目买单。玩家理应对游戏可用性有一个基本的期待，甚至对游戏性，可靠性，稳定性，乃至运行硬件支持，都可以有一个基本的要求。\n\n但是在Melody，无法看到，综合得分3分。\n\n\n---\n\n# 经济模型（满分20 得分6）\n\n由于项目没有产品实际体现具体的经济模型，我们可以通过其愿景进行评价，但是要进行没有实际产品落地的扣分。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EQTrmwrdlEtCD4O0_Hqpj.png?height=1360&width=1998)\n\n**代币机制**：双代币模型，功能和场景应用与STEPN的代币机制类似。通货代币通过每日唱歌听歌产出，维修解锁新玩法燃烧。\n\n白皮书中提到了三种游戏场景：唱歌模式，听歌模式，卡拉OK模式。\n\n唱歌模式可以直接通过唱歌获得代币，在白皮书中没有提到对质量的要求。听歌模式可以直接获得代币奖励，这里直接就会产生一个基本不可调和的作弊问题。部分防作弊方法，或许是调低听歌的代币奖励，鼓励大家更多的去唱歌。卡拉OK模式是利用玩家间唱歌PK评分，来决定最后的收益。实际对一种艺术的好坏评分如果直接由是否唱准声调，或许有些过于生硬。\n\n实际Melody并没有在经济模型上有本质创新，预期的方案即使未来能够落实在产品中，还是在走STEPN的能量定额产出+Walken的PK产出的老路。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u5u8J8elLaVKpKmtRtwEn.png?height=1320&width=2270)\n\n项目方在deck里面特意放了一页Melody的优势，试图证明自己不是Ponzi。\n\n但是实际项目方强调的Melody所具备的特质，比如建立所谓的正向外部性，用户是来创造高质量内容而非赚钱，在大多数X2E的应用中都有，众多的运动类应用还可以多一个培养好习惯的特点。\n\n个人认为Melody未来可以做的一点是，利用平台吸引高质量原创作家，然后原创者可以租售自己的音乐NFT给其他玩家演唱来获利。但是其中处处都存在难度，玩家更可以选择免费的作品获得更高的收益。\n\n不管未来真正开发的场景有多少，这里的代币机制面临的问题，还是一样避免不了Ponzi模型。因为资金池子就这么大，流入资金总不会小于流出资金。市面上免费的k歌软件比比皆是，如果解决不了玩家充值投入的动机，那么大多数玩家注定会达成或期望达成经济系统的价值净流出，目的依旧是获利。\n\n如果模型落实在产品中，得分12分，但目前没有产品，所有的模型还只是预期，故得分需要打折扣，综合得分6分。\n\n\n---\n\n# 运营（满分15 得分8）\n\n这项实际包含了3部分，**用户+市场+社区的运营度**。\n\n对于**市场运营**，Melody做的还算不错，在没有产品的阶段就可以把热度炒的很高，拉了多名KOL为其做宣发，包括了前期的discount WL giveaway还有目前正在进行的airdrop giveaway。当时公售前，也积攒了不少热度，讨论的用户较多。\n\n对于**用户和社区的运营**，一些玩家反馈是在走STEPN的高压严管的老路。（以下截图为当事人爆料，因为我没有直接经历，真实性暂时存疑吧，如果有了解的朋友也欢迎提供信息）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LzGXusyGVOz39KTofS9NX.png?height=290&width=758)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jJY3wUk7NbK5ad0Yl06oN.png?height=166&width=654)\n\n社区在还没有发布产品时就容不得各种质疑和反对的声音，这种情况其实见的不多。STEPN对言论的高压管理，也是到了后期才相对明显。\n\n如果在项目早期就不接受玩家质疑和意见，甚至直接大规模封禁，行为就显得非常可疑。这种对言论的管控，一般随着项目的发展只会越来越严重。\n\n综合得分8分，主要得分在市场运营方面。\n\n\n---\n\n# 团队和资方（满分20 得分5）\n\n### 团队\n\n团队在官网有实名，但是没有照片。我尝试花了一些去Linkedin搜索，但是除了一个应该是CEO的名片，其他成员信息都没有找到。\n\n这应该是CEO的名片Alex Patrick，符合其姓名，Stanford University，Software Engineer at Google：\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-patrick-906a82233/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-patrick-906a82233/)\n\n不过，仔细看Alex的个人经历，2020年才从Stanford的master毕业，学的是EE。20年入职谷歌，全职工作到现在。并行的期间还有一个在Assure Wallet的Chief Technology Officer的全职工作。首席技术官和Google SDE并行全职。\n\n推测大概是16年从一个可能不太知名的本科毕业（因为前面没写），然后在工作了两年多，然后在去读了两年硕，毕业后又在Google和Assure Wallet工作了两年。\n\nMelody官网的介绍8+ years experience in coding，如果加上本科，应该够了。\n\n不过，CEO没有过太丰富的创业经历，主要还是以科研向为主。产品，游戏开发的经验会比较欠缺。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YZk6_sNENxWRnOfbphTr-.png?height=1682&width=1696)\n\n之后我又在Linkedin搜了官网展示的其他三位成员，可以说是完全搜不到。要不是假的信息，要不就是这些人完全不用Linkedin，可能也没有任何名气，毕竟在美国Linkedin还是像名片一样的存在。再加上团队都不露脸，这里我是非常怀疑的。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KWt4oci2wactgJ3GXO55q.png?height=1418&width=1208)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P5h-GPaVNlTYzlUOTVwBJ.png?height=1266&width=1200)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y_ndyHFZqr8lkprD3lALj.png?height=1274&width=1252)\n\n### 资方\n\n没有资方\n\n暂时只是上了TofuNFT平台和OKX的NFT，代币还没有上CEX。可以说，暂时没有任何背书。\n\n综合得分5分。\n\n\n---\n\n# 项目格局（满分10 得分2）\n\n很早之前，我就有了一个评价标准：**先有产品/先卖NFT**。Melody是选择了没有产品时，卖NFT。而且卖了快一个月了，期间一直在增加WL名额，但产品还是没有任何动静。\n\n**内测/公测体验门槛**：这实际是我的一个评判标准，但在这就不用多说了。之前公测的NFT卖到1.5BNB，差不多是300多U。这相比于之前Walken在产品上线后的1-4SOL的盲盒公售，还有STEPN全盛时期在BSC链的0.5BNB盲盒公售，可以说是贵了非常多。\n\n相比之下，STEPN和Walken等应用先出产品，然后免费送NFT的格局，就显得大很多。甚至Walken在公测开始，还是可以领免费的NFT，体验游戏的门槛几乎为零。\n\n不过项目方提到Cancel IDO，勉强算是一点格局吧，综合得分2分。\n\n\n---\n\n# 风险\n\n**歌曲版权风险**：世界不同地区有不同版权法律政策，因为涉及到歌曲，必然存在版权问题。\n\n不知道项目方是否能够未来买断足够多的音乐版权。如果买的歌曲版权数量不够，也会对实际体验造成直接影响。\n\n暂不扣分。\n\n\n---\n\n# 总结（满分100 得分34）\n\nMelody项目在公售后快一个月，至今没有实际产品，是一个最主要的减分项。\n\n其唱歌场景并不具备正向激励性，也不是大多数玩家希望每天去做，养成的一个好习惯，但场景具备创新属性。\n\n经济模型没有太多创新，实际还是在走Ponzi的老路，只是将定量收益和PK收益结合。\n\n市场运营热度较高，但是华语社区据传之前控评较严重，需要警惕。\n\n团队不露脸，看似实名，但大多无法搜索到，唯一能搜到的CEO产品/游戏经验有限，无资方背书。\n\n格局小，在有产品前先卖NFT，且体验门槛高。\n\n**虽然不排除之后有可能做出产品，但个人不看好其发展。**\n\n\n---\n\n我是菠萝，欢迎关注我的Twitter：\n\n[https://twitter.com/0xBigPineapple](https://twitter.com/0xBigPineapple)\n\n###
