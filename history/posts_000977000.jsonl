Let's find out!**\n\n**TLDR** \n\n* Miners Capitulating\n* Consequences of A Capitulation Event\n* Interesting Onchain Activity in Ethereum \n* Binance Whales and Their Masterplan\n\n## Miners Capitulating\n\nIt is no big secret that miners control most of the active bitcoin liquidity. Yes, whales are influential players, but many miners, over time, become whales. And when the miners sell their bitcoin reserves, it points to an eventual bottom of the market. Of course, when miners sell, it leads to short-term dips too. But for long-term enthusiasts of bitcoin, capitulation is a solid buy signal.\n\n**So, what exactly is Miners' reserve?** It is the amount of Bitcoin held by miners. At the same time, it is worth noting that the value accounts for affiliate miners only. That means the reserve excludes old miners who don't have any mining activity now.\n\n### What Is The Status Of Capitulation?\n\nSince 2021, miners have been consistently accumulating bitcoin. It also means that the miners have not realized any significant profit in the last 18 months!\n\n![Capitulation](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yOppEJpWc3CRZ2Em3ytI-.png?height=2700&width=4287)\n\nBut now, miners are forced to sell their biggest bag since 2021.\nSome major reasons are;\n\n1. Increasing mining costs\n2. Decreased price of bitcoin\n\nMany miners are left with no option other than to sell some of their reserves.\n\n### What Are The Consequences?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the most critical consequence is a short-term price fall. There is too much selling pressure from miners and minimal buying pressure from investors. There is a supply-demand mismatch, and the market might settle for a lower bitcoin price.\n\n## Interesting Onchain Activity In Ethereum\n\nEthereum had a great turn of events, especially after [announcing the merge date](https://twitter.com/WeekInEthNews/status/1548101125101867009). It was crucial for the entire altcoin market (most pumped 10-30%). But Ethereum is still trading below its 2018 all-time high.\n\nTwo Transactions caught my attention today.\n\n<https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe150141e9d9e0af32796416d2be37ac7addecd1250117e51a2a5062703752fef>\n\n```\nToday, on 18th July, 20.4K ETH was transferred to the FTX exchange. \n```\n\nThe wallet holds almost $250K worth of assets now, and its primary and secondary wallets hold $48 million and $31 million in assets respectively. Most importantly, the wallets are stable coin dominated and are 2-3 years old.\n\n![source : Etherscan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V6DAyB0uMvJcpCyCqT4hp.png?height=391&width=943)\n\nThis tells us that, at least some of the whales do not believe the bear market is over.\n\n<https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7b760bb4ca67c2492e0453b30c8918eb530bd473defd2a94fe40d4fd1ab98026>\n\n![source : Etherscan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Et21v-JRCKfZj6NalxkXZ.png?height=391&width=943)\n\nLike the first wallet, this one is also a whale wallet that holds 84.5K ETH and $587 million worth of assets.\n\nThis whale is also panicking, trying to sell all his altcoins.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UpGG38Ma4SsDAxqVFd7bw.png?height=933&width=1363)\n\nThe above two examples tell us three things particularly;\n\n1. Whales are not happy with the market. They will possibly dump on relief rallies. \n2. It is better to take profits when the market is green. \n3. We might experience a long bear market this time.\n\n## Masterplan Of Binance Whales\n\nBinance is the biggest centralized crypto exchange with the most volume and liquidity. These factors make Binance a whale destination. But has the inflows to Binance affected bitcoin?\n\nLet’s see how bitcoin price action is correlated with the exchange inflow into Binance.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cl4MS45nRTUHRCELJcPJ1.png?height=2700&width=4287)\n\nIn mid-march 2022, the exchange inflow to Binance was at moderate levels.\nBitcoin was ranging between 38k and 47k at that time.\n\nBut as soon as the price crashed to 32k in the first week of May, whales started sending their bitcoin holdings to exchanges to sell in profit.\n\nBut the bitcoin price was relatively stable for the next two weeks. Probably whales were looking for exit liquidity, and did not want the price to dip further.\n\nWhales succeeded and were able to sell their BTC at 32k- 30k level, which precipitated another fall to 20k in June 2022.\n\nSince then, BTC has been trading in the 19k - 21k price range. However, on 17th July, inflows broke the moderate levels again!\n\nAre Binance whales planning another dump? Only time will tell.

Join us as we look back on a great fireside chat that spanned a range of topics, from Evgeny’s experience using PWN to the best security practices in DeFi and the future of NFTs.\n\n### Introduction\n\nSteve and [Evgeny](https://twitter.com/evgeny_re7) first met about a year ago, when Evgeny reached out to Steve after both took part in a call together with some folks from [MetaCartel](https://twitter.com/Meta_Cartel). They’ve stayed in touch since then, and just recently, our team has been in touch with Evgeny about a [super exciting Nouns NFT loan](https://twitter.com/pwndao/status/1547854897478963200?s=20&t=Av67GzoUdR5v21bQt1x1Sg) worth $60K that’s currently backed on the PWN platform. Through this process, Evgeny had a chance to get up and personal with our platform.\n\n### What does Re7 Capital think of the PWN platform?\n\nEvgeny was one of the first people to use the recently released version of the [PWN protocol and platform](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/). So what was his experience like while using it?\n\n* **Great UX and UI**: Evgeny mentioned that using PWN is smooth and the process is super straightforward. He’s a fan of our clean UI (and enjoys our simple yet aesthetically pleasing color palette)! \n \n* **Verification made easy**: Using PWN, it’s easy to cross-check assets on OpenSea. This is because we include an asset explorer link (such as Opensea) directly on a loan’s detail page. [Visit PWN](https://pwn.xyz/) to learn more.\n\n### All about the Nouns deal\n\n[Our first Nouns NFT loan](https://twitter.com/pwndao/status/1547854897478963200?s=20&t=Av67GzoUdR5v21bQt1x1Sg) is a big deal. \n\nWe’re extra excited about it, since there are only 374 Nouns in existence with a floor price of 108 ETH (roughly $115,560) per NFT. Around 10,000 Nouns are estimated to be around in the late 2040s, so there’s currently less potential sell pressure and buyers are closely involved through proposals and the nounification of the NFT landscape.\n\nThe Nouns community is one of the most active communities out there, and they actively manage their treasury. What makes this community really stand out is how well-structured it is as well as the fact that the team is composed of real DeFi professionals.\n\nNouns’ average price has been going up over the last \\~120 days, with an average 90-day price of 96 ETH and a 90-day volume of 2,807 ETH. Nouns DAO has implemented some best practices of other blue-chip PFP projects – they’re CC0 and they have been innovating with funding mechanisms. \n\nWhen using the platform, PWN users don’t need to worry about owning an NFT worth 100 ETH. Since PWN is deployed on Polygon, network fees won’t be a problem for NFTs with a smaller value. [Check out the PWN platform for yourself](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/)!\n\n### Steve’s questions for Re7\n\nA large segment of our fireside chat with [Re7](https://twitter.com/Re7Capital) was spent discussing some hot topics in a Q&A session. We’ll sum up some of the questions that Steve had for Evgeny.\n\n**How do you check that you’re interacting with the right contract?**\n\nRe7 carries out dozens of on-chain transactions every day and has been doing so for a year. In the team’s day-to-day activities, maintaining security is a top priority. ”It’s really easy to lose money on the blockchain if you’re not careful”, said Evgeny. “It’s really important to double check everything you’re doing.”\n\nEvgeny emphasized the ongoing need to keep one’s security in check while mentioning a few notable industry vulnerabilities, such as the exploits affecting [Convex](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/24/convex-finance-sets-up-new-urls-after-website-address-is-hijacked/), [Harmony](https://decrypt.co/104138/north-korean-attackers-behind-100m-harmony-hack-report), and [Solana’s Wormhole](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/03/solanas-sol-tumbles-10-after-326m-wormhole-exploit/).\n\nA couple pieces of advice to stay on top of one’s security are as follows: Always be sure to [verify contract addresses on Etherscan](https://info.etherscan.com/how-to-verify-address-ownership/#:\\~:text=Step%201%3A%20Upon%20clicking%20on,able%20to%20sign%20the%20message.) and check that any collateral is really what you think it is. \n\n**Do you proactively revoke approvals that you think you won’t be using in the future?**\n\nThe Re7 team finds it the most efficient to carry out periodic reviews. “The reality is that if you’re doing this all the time, it can become painful,” said Evgeny. In order to bolster security, they also make use of many different wallets — that way, if someone gets unlucky, they’re able to contain the damage.\n\n**Do you get a lot of scammy content in your DMs?**\n\nRe7 receives *a lot* of scammy messages on their channels. As a rule of thumb, the only people who they respond to and communicate with are those who they actively know. Otherwise, they choose to block other DMs, around five to seven of which they receive daily on Twitter.\n\nEvgeny’s advice: If you get a message from someone you don’t know asking for information and/or help, it’s best to assume it’s a scam until proven otherwise\n\n**How does Re7 Capital evaluate risks when investing? Has the playbook changed in any way now that we’re in a bear market?**\n\nEvgeny pointed out the importance of distinguishing between real risk and the perception of risk. He compared dealings within DeFi with the oft-cited quote, “If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.” He commented that there’s a similar result in DeFi; in other words, “If you don’t know where the yield is coming from, you’re the yield.”\n\nIn regards to the current state of the market, Re7 sees how the perception of risk has affected how people manage their money. Because liquidity has dried up, the playbook has changed and is currently evolving at a rapid pace.\n\n### Thoughts on DAOs\n\nAs the conversation turned to the topic of DAOs, Evgeny went over a few key facts about Re7’s organizational structure: Re7 has its own investment fund, and Evgeny is a part of MetaCartel. The company is fully regulated and compliant in what they do, which ultimately protects them as a business. Re7 decided against moving to a DAO, but in general, they feel that certain organizational structures are relevant for a company’s respective use case.\n\nAccording to Evgeny, investment teams can either choose to be very open or opt for efficiency over openness. His team’s experience has demonstrated that communication in a more closed environment allows for making decisions instantly.\n\n### Final reflections\n\nTwo things that Evgeny is excited about looking ahead are NFTs and the metaverse. He was curious how the PWN team envisions the future of NFTs.\n\nAs Steve put it, “We need to see a proper marriage between NFTs and the DeFi ecosystem”. He recently dove into the importance of this topic during a talk on how to onboard a billion DeFi users (more on that in [our recent monthly digest](https://pwn.mirror.xyz/I6TjFg0MVUZx542XnKzsZDs1P4UzrOtrRk86a4i6lYQ)).\n\nIn the next six months, PWN will be able to do things with NFTs that web2 has never even dreamed of — so stay tuned! For now, check out the platform to:\n\n* See how much others are willing to lend\n* Check out the loans available at the moment\n* See other NFT collections that are currently listed\n* …and more!\n\n[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PWNFinance) to stay as up to date as possible on our team’s daily activities.\n\n\n---\n\n**A massive thank you to Evgeny and Re7 Capital for teaming up with us for this session. We’re excited to see where things continue to take us together.** ", "timestamp": 1658144795, "digest": "2SvdL9Jt2QR5IkatMqXxo7B2CIt9UK-T2_clqnMh_dI", "contributor": "0xb52a0e0CF7e6c50e003c07162F8762aDeD5c2539"}

VERI-ZEXE покращує сучасний рівень \\[1\\] приблизно в 9,0 разів при генерації транзакцій і в \\~ 2,6 рази при використанні пам’яті, і використовуватиметься в майбутніх версіях CAPE, щоб увімкнути довільну політику ресурсів, визначену користувачем, зберігаючи можливість налаштування конфіденційність активів.\n\nПерегляньте документ ePrint [тут](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/802.pdf) і GitHub [тут](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/veri-zexe).\n\n## ZEXE: історія та обмеження\n\n Системи розумних контрактів, такі як Ethereum і Solana, є чудовим середовищем для інновацій web3. Однак вони страждають від відсутності конфіденційності або масштабованості, а іноді і того, і іншого. Щоб забезпечити публічну перевірку, усі стани програм та зміни станів є публічними та прозорими, жертвуючи конфіденційністю, а всі транзакції чи обчислення повторно виконуються всіма (повними) вузлами, що впливає на масштабованість.\n\nУ 2019 році Боу та ін. запропонував схему під назвою децентралізоване приватне обчислення (DPC), яка дозволяє користувачам виконувати довільні обчислення поза ланцюгом і надсилати транзакцію, що засвідчує правильність цих обчислень, використовуючи докази з нульовим знанням \\[2\\]. Вони впровадили систему під назвою ZEXE (zk-виконання), яка створює екземпляр схеми DPC для вирішення обох проблемних моментів, наведених вище. Приблизно, ZEXE — це «програмований Zcash», узагальнений від системи з одним додатком до системи смарт-контрактів із збереженням гарантій конфіденційності.\n\nДеякі варті уваги особливості ZEXE:\n\n* **Конфіденційність даних і функцій**: ZEXE приховує всі стани програми, а також входи/виходи для викликів функцій (конфіденційність даних) і, що важливо, *які функції/програми викликаються* в кожній транзакції (конфіденційність функції). Навіть з численними подальшими альтернативними підходами до приватних смарт-контрактів, ZEXE залишається єдиною конкретною конструкцією, яка забезпечує конфіденційність функцій (див. [відповідний розділ роботи](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/802.pdf#subsection.1.1.3) в статті).\n\n\n* **Програмованість**: за допомогою ZEXE користувачі можуть приєднувати довільні правила/предикати до запису (подібно до ідеї Bitcoin Script), який визначає правила переходу для відповідних станів програми. Bowe та ін. показали, як програмувати визначені користувачем активи, DEX і стейблкоїни, що відповідають нормам, у моделі ZEXE.\n\n\n* **Коротка перевірка**: валідаторам у мережі не потрібно повторно виконувати обчислення. Натомість вони перевіряють короткі докази дійсності транзакцій, що займає постійний час, незалежно від того, наскільки дорогими є обчислення поза мережею.\n\nІснуючі реалізації (SnarkVM testnet 1 і SnarkVM testnet 2) забезпечують описані вище функції, але мають недоліки, які обмежують їх практичність і залишають багато можливостей для вдосконалення: \\[3\\]:\n\n* **Спеціальне налаштування схеми**: ZEXE (SnarkVM testnet1) використовує неуніверсальні SNARK, як-от GM17 і Groth16, для сертифікації правильності виконання смарт-контрактів, що забезпечує надійне налаштування для кожної програми, що є дуже непрактичним.\n\n\n* **Продуктивність**: ZEXE з універсальним SNARK (SnarkVM testnet2) зазнає значного погіршення продуктивності через вищу складність універсальної логіки перевірки SNARK і того факту, що ZEXE вимагає створення доказу SNARK для заяви, яка кодує логіку перевірки SNARK.\n\n## VERI-ZEXE: універсальне налаштування без втрати продуктивності\n\n\nVERI-ZEXE вирішує дві вищезазначені проблеми, зберігаючи всі функції та властивості оригінального ZEXE, запроваджуючи багато оптимізацій для зменшення складності схеми універсального гаджета верифікатора SNARK. Ми відсилаємо читачів до статті VERI-ZEXE для детального опису цих методів; у цьому дописі ми лише демонструємо та інтерпретуємо результати наших тестів.\n\nПо-перше, ми порівнюємо себе з найсучаснішими реалізаціями ZEXE, серед яких найважливіші показники включають час генерації транзакції (тобто алгоритм `Execute`), використання пам’яті та розмір підтвердження дійсності транзакції. Як показано нижче, наша продуктивність відповідає оригінальному неуніверсальному ZEXE. Порівняно з найкращою універсальною реалізацією ZEXE ми досягли **\\~9,0-кратного покращення генерації транзакцій** і **\\~2,6-кратного покращення використання пам’яті.**\n\n![Порівняння трьох реалізацій DPC для транзакції 2 входи-2 виходи, що працюють на AMD EPYC 7R13 на частоті 2,65 ГГц із 64 ядрами та 128 ГБ оперативної пам’яті.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rY8a286rowibKu_nFngdu.png?height=266&width=1270)\n\nПо-друге, ми надаємо детальніше порівняння з SnarkVM testnet2. Як показано нижче, розмір нашої зовнішньої схеми (яка використовується під час композиції перевірки глибини 2) набагато менший, і, отже, час перевірки на порядок швидший, що призводить до набагато швидшого створення перевірки для всіх параметрів транзакції:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SPBYiuOpU4eXLyGCjaVnH.png?height=968&width=1364)\n\nНарешті, щоб проілюструвати наші інновації в системі обмежень TurboPlonk і UltraPlonk, а також наші методи оптимізації, ми надаємо розбивку вартості обмежень для криптографічних будівельних блоків, які використовуються у VERI-ZEXE. Ми поділилися цими основними моментами щодо складності гаджетів, коли представили нашу бібліотеку Jellyfish на початку цього року.\n\nКількість PLONK обмежено для основних криптографічних будівельних блоків і алгебраїчних операцій. Ці цифри є специфічними для конструкції TurboPlonk.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/244YxLT5O1JV4p70X7Wwe.png?height=774&width=928)\n\n## VERI-ZEXE + CAPE: настроювана політика активів\n\nНезважаючи на те, що ZEXE не є ідеальним рішенням для приватних смарт-контрактів (через інші проблеми, згадані в \\[3\\]), це чудове рішення для додатків із мінімальними спільними станами серед користувачів, які насолоджуватимуться високим паралелізмом і низькою залежністю від транзакцій за умов Модель UTXO. Продукт [CAPE](https://www.espressosys.com/blog/cape-configurable-asset-privacy-for-ethereum) є чудовим прикладом того, як це може виглядати для користувачів.\n\nНаразі наш протокол CAPE підтримує лише попередньо визначений набір політик активів (наприклад, увімкнення карбування, анонімних передач, заморожування ключів, призначені політики перегляду тощо), але не підтримує динамічні, визначені користувачем політики активів. Уявіть, що ви хочете створити новий «концертний токен», який має загальну кількість 1000 одиниць і може бути викарбуваний, лише якщо певний актив буде сплачено на вказану адресу. Ця нова політика карбування, пов’язана з нашим новим токеном концерту, виходить за рамки того, що може застосовувати поточний продукт CAPE. Це загальна вимога та бажана функція для емітентів активів, щоб мати можливість розробляти індивідуальні, більш складні політики для своїх майбутніх активів. VERI-ZEXE зробить таку можливість програмування можливою.\n\n«VERI-ZEXE може служити основою для приватних смарт-контрактів. Порівняно з попередньою роботою, він підтримує універсальне налаштування та \\~9x прискорення генерації транзакцій, а також \\~2,6x економію використання пам’яті, підштовхуючи такі програми, як приватні стейблкоїни, з довільна, настроювана політика активів у сфері практичності», – каже Алекс Сюн, перший автор.\n\nБіньї Чен, головний криптограф Espresso Systems, додав: «Методики, що лежать в основі VERI-ZEXE, не обмежуються забезпеченням конфіденційності, але також допомагають у масштабованості. Наприклад, ті самі методи можна використовувати для оптимізації продуктивності так званих zk-zk -rollup, де зведення застосовується до форматів транзакцій із нульовим знанням (приватних), таких як CAP або Zcash.\"\n\nМи опублікуємо більше про наші розробки для вдосконалення CAPE у наступних публікаціях і дуже раді, що ці новаторські інновації принесуть Espresso. Залишайтеся на зв'язку!\n\n## Виноски\n\n\\[1\\]: SnarkVM від Aleo має багато ітерацій: їх версія testnet1 є досить точною реалізацією ZEXE, описаною в документі S&P19, яка вимагає довірених налаштувань для конкретної програми; рання версія testnet2 замінює систему доказів, яка використовувалася для створення доказів для предикатів народження/смерті, з GM17 на Marlin, роблячи систему «універсальною»; пізніша версія testnet2 і майбутні версії testnet відходять від оригінальної моделі DPC, спрощуючи модель, але обмежуючи її програмованість (наприклад, забороняючи міжпрограмний виклик). Нова, спрощена, але обмежена модель DPC, оскільки testnet3 виходить за межі цього блогу, а наш код порівнюється з testnet1 і попередньою версією testnet2. Ми внесли додаткові модифікації в їхній код, щоб зробити справедливе порівняння під час бенчмарку, див. докладніше в розділі 4.2 статті.\n\n\\[2\\]: Загальний потік обчислень поза ланцюгом і перевірки підтвердження цілісності обчислень у ланцюзі може звучати схоже на zk-rollup. Користувачі в ZEXE генерують підтвердження дійсності транзакції та надсилають транзакції безпосередньо в ланцюжок, тоді як користувачі в zk-Rollup надсилають транзакцію валідаторам зведення, які потім створять підтвердження zk для надсилання в ланцюг. Технічно ZEXE не хвилює, як виконується обчислення поза ланцюгом: одним користувачем, чи багатокористувацьким протоколом MPC, чи зведеним сервером, тому ми вважаємо ці два підходи взаємодоповнюючими.\n\n\\[3\\]: Є багато інших проблем із ZEXE, зокрема проблема паралельності (коли кілька користувачів намагаються одночасно перевести спільний стан у новий стан), можливість атомарної композиції (досягнення програми, подібної до Flashloan, у ZEXE потребуватиме техніки, яку ми називаємо «в -нагромадження пакетів», які трохи змінюють нано-ядро запису (RNK) ZEXE), складність програмування предикатів у моделі UTXO (існуюче рішення, таке як Chialisp). Ми спробуємо представити наші підходи до деяких із цих проблем у наступних публікаціях блогу.", "timestamp": 1658145126, "digest": "yk47ira6H0aBxcDu6OTM7YH1ZQYAd_BYkNF8edYdy5o", "contributor": "0x9b8EcC555143FC33b9809e7F4DC69179161208aE"}

A criatividade nas ideias é assombrosa. Existem iniciativas para[ distribuir de óculos a crianças](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12),[ criar uma marca de feijão exclusiva da Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/vote/97) e até um[ patrocinar um time de esportes radicais em nome da organização](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n8fhWrjrnUxMk4LE3JkGq.png?height=527&width=953)\n\n[Os dados](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vr6HSACMRce3SExF5tQNVIzqL8oPs5TOpgFRoYxWHbA/edit?usp=sharing) sugerem pouco interesse da comunidade em usar o tesouro para fomentar *public goods.* Somente 13%¹ destinaram-se a este objetivo, somando cerca de U$1.75M² do investimento aplicado em propostas pela DAO. Destacam-se as[ doações para a UNICEF](https://nouns.wtf/vote/42), ao[ instituto sem fins lucrativos do Tony Hawk](https://nouns.wtf/vote/40) e a campanha de[ distribuição de óculos para crianças](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/67zjdY3dSU_2KmStIampQ.png?height=552&width=1244)\n\nCom a intenção de viabilizar o acesso ao capital da Nouns para projetos de menor porte, em dezembro de 2021,[ uma proposta aprovada na DAO originou a Prop House.](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23) Seu diferencial é que qualquer um pode apresentar uma ideia e requerer fundos, mesmo sem possuir um NFT da organização.\n\n![Na Prop House, cerca de U$42 mil foram destinados a propostas voltadas para financiar bens públicos.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NvYxfbAZ5viecNzxMOphr.png?height=527&width=953)\n\nAté o momento, [192 projetos foram beneficiados](https://prop.house/) com o programa, a um custo de \\~U$150.000 para a Nouns DAO.

Ambas são fundamentais para a organização prosperar. Mas, para que a NounsDAO ganhe legitimidade além da criptosfera, parece prudente escapar à circularidade do modelo de \"*captar dinheiro para se auto-promover para captar mais dinheiro*\". Aqui vão 2 ideias:\n\n* **Desenvolver uma Prop House voltada para investimentos em *public goods.*** Nos moldes das Prop Houses que já existem..\n* **Estabelecer um comitê ou diretriz para *public goods*.** Recentemente, a DAO aprovou [a criação do Nouncil](https://nouns.wtf/vote/67): um comitê de membros com remuneração fixa, com base no histórico de participação em votações e discussões. Este comitê poderia debater e sugerir uma \"alocação desejada\" do caixa da comunidade para bens públicos, que sirva de diretriz, ou até designar um sub-comitê para fomentar esse tipo de iniciativa dentro da organização.\n\nAcima de qualquer crítica, vale ressaltar: uma pesquisa como essa só é possível por conta da transparência nos processos da NounsDAO. Este é, sobretudo, o olhar de um observador externo.\n\n[Como diria o Punk 4156](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12), um \"*pool* de capital de fato não-permissionado não tem como ter um propósito totalmente explícito\". Será sujeita ao \"mercado de ideias\", e as melhores vencerão.

Este poder ainda é difícil de perceber, pra quem habita fora da criptosfera. Como boa parte da indústria, Nouns ainda são extremamente auto-referenciais.\n\nO que significa \"*nounificar o mundo*\", afinal?

O significado dessa missão é fluido, e objeto de debate.\n\nJá se falou em tornar os óculos quadrados da Nouns DAO tão [conhecidos e desejados](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1509173517354418180) quanto marcas como [Nike](https://twitter.com/b00tgm/status/1521166004855922696), Gucci ou Ferrari.\n\nJá se postulou que a organização deva priorizar [investimentos em \"bens comuns\"](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12) (*public goods*): projetos educacionais, sociais ou que gerem benefícios coletivos.\n\nHá quem creia que um status como o de marcas famosas só será obtido caso a DAO consiga juntar as duas coisas: a vontade de ostentar com a capacidade de transformar o capital dos ostentadores em algo de útil para a sociedade.\n\n![Etapas para propostas serem apresentadas, votadas e executadas na governança da Nouns DAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j3GQmKIVZdJ4KJgx0ni0W.png?height=874&width=1600)\n\nDepois de um ano de vida, a Nouns DAO investiu \\~U$29.76M nas 102 propostas apresentadas em sua governança. A criatividade nas ideias é assombrosa. Existem iniciativas para[ distribuir de óculos a crianças](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12),[ criar uma marca de feijão exclusiva da Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/vote/97) e até um[ patrocinar um time de esportes radicais em nome da organização](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n8fhWrjrnUxMk4LE3JkGq.png?height=527&width=953)\n\n[Os dados](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vr6HSACMRce3SExF5tQNVIzqL8oPs5TOpgFRoYxWHbA/edit?usp=sharing) sugerem pouco interesse da comunidade em usar o tesouro para fomentar *public goods.* Somente 13%¹ destinaram-se a este objetivo, somando cerca de U$1.75M² do investimento aplicado em propostas pela DAO. Destacam-se as[ doações para a UNICEF](https://nouns.wtf/vote/42), ao[ instituto sem fins lucrativos do Tony Hawk](https://nouns.wtf/vote/40) e a campanha de[ distribuição de óculos para crianças](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/67zjdY3dSU_2KmStIampQ.png?height=552&width=1244)\n\nCom a intenção de viabilizar o acesso ao capital da Nouns para projetos de menor porte, em dezembro de 2021,[ uma proposta aprovada na DAO originou a Prop House.](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23) Seu diferencial é que qualquer um pode apresentar uma ideia e requerer fundos, mesmo sem possuir um NFT da organização.\n\n![Na Prop House, cerca de U$42 mil foram destinados a propostas voltadas para financiar bens públicos.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NvYxfbAZ5viecNzxMOphr.png?height=527&width=953)\n\nAté o momento, [192 projetos foram beneficiados](https://prop.house/) com o programa, a um custo de \\~U$150.000 para a Nouns DAO. Este dinheiro catalisou projetos de [reflorestamento](https://prop.house/proposal/149), [educação web3](https://prop.house/proposal/56) e até a criação de uma [marca de maconha da Nouns DAO](https://prop.house/proposal/112).\n\nNa Prop House, a baixa oferta de ideias voltadas a *public goods* permanece: **13,5% das propostas apresentadas na Prop House buscaram este fim.**\n\nDentre as propostas aprovadas, **27% voltam-se para *public goods*.** A porcentagem é maior em relação à governança principal da Nouns DAO, mas o dinheiro arrecadado via Prop House é substancialmente menor.\n\nHá um desequilíbrio entre iniciativas com benefícios coletivos e ações de marketing. Ambas são fundamentais para a organização prosperar. Mas, para que a NounsDAO ganhe legitimidade além da criptosfera, parece prudente escapar à circularidade do modelo de \"*captar dinheiro para se auto-promover para captar mais dinheiro*\". Aqui vão 2 ideias:\n\n* **Desenvolver uma Prop House voltada para investimentos em *public goods.*** Nos moldes das Prop Houses que já existem..\n* **Estabelecer um comitê ou diretriz para *public goods*.** Recentemente, a DAO aprovou [a criação do Nouncil](https://nouns.wtf/vote/67): um comitê de membros com remuneração fixa, com base no histórico de participação em votações e discussões. Este comitê poderia debater e sugerir uma \"alocação desejada\" do caixa da comunidade para bens públicos, que sirva de diretriz, ou até designar um sub-comitê para fomentar esse tipo de iniciativa dentro da organização.\n\nAcima de qualquer crítica, vale ressaltar: uma pesquisa como essa só é possível por conta da transparência nos processos da NounsDAO. Este é, sobretudo, o olhar de um observador externo.\n\n[Como diria o Punk 4156](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12), um \"*pool* de capital de fato não-permissionado não tem como ter um propósito totalmente explícito\". Será sujeita ao \"mercado de ideias\", e as melhores vencerão. Talvez o empurrão que a DAO precise para se conectar mais intimamente \"ao mundo material\" não venha de dentro, mas de fora.\n\n[4156 especulou](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12) que o \"superpoder da organização\" é \"proporcional à sua capacidade de tornar o mundo melhor para todos\". Este poder ainda é difícil de perceber, pra quem habita fora da criptosfera. Como boa parte da indústria, Nouns ainda são extremamente auto-referenciais.\n\nO que significa \"*nounificar o mundo*\", afinal?

"**Tokenomics**（トークノミクス）はクリプトプロジェクトにおいて最も重要な項目の一つ。\n\n「トークノミクスを理解しないと成功しない」という人も中にはいます。\n\n今回は[Covduk氏](https://twitter.com/Cov_duk)の協力を得てトークノミクスについてまとめました。\n\nプロジェクトやトークンに関する前提知識がないと少し難しい内容かもですが、できるだけ分かりやすくまとめたので本記事を読んでトークノミクスについて詳しくなりましょう。\n\n## トークノミクスとは?\n\nまず「トークノミクスとはなにか」と言われると一般的には、トークンの絡んだ経済やインセンティブという抽象的なものを指す言葉です。広義として以下のようなものを含みます。\n\n* トークンの仕組み\n* 需要と供給\n* トークンにまつわるメカニズム\n* インセンティブ、心理学、行動学\n* ゲーム理論\n\nなどなど、トークノミクスの語源にもなっている「**Token**」の「**Economics**」、経済の部分ですね。\n\n## 需要と供給\n\n「トークノミクス＝需要と供給」と過言ではないぐらい重要なポイント、まずはわかりやすいトークンの供給の部分から順番に見ていきましょう。\n\n### トークノミクスで生み出すトークンの供給\n\n供給量をコントロールすることで簡単にトークンに希少性を出すことが可能です。\n\n例えば需要が一定である場合、市場への供給量が少ないほど希少性により価値が上昇します。\n\nプロジェクトにおいては、トークンの価値を維持・上昇させるために、供給量を固定して過度なインフレを防ぐなどの工夫をいくつか行っています。\n\n* Bitcoin\n\nBitcoinを例に上げるとわかりやすいかもしれません。Bitcoinが通貨や資産として優れていると言われる理由の一つとしてこのトークノミクスが関係しているからです。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jX1Adfxkda-30eo1CVjwX.png?height=340&width=680)\n\nBitcoinの最大供給量は2100万枚で固定されており、すでに約90%に値する1910万枚が発行されています。ちなみにすべての供給予定量が一気に放出されるわけではありません。\n\nしかし、仮にいまの供給量が突如2倍になったらどうでしょう?\n\n昨日まで買えなくてプレミア価格だったPS5が、どこの店舗にも潤沢な在庫数になったイメージです。供給量が増加するともちろん価値は下がることが予測されます。\n\n話が少し脱線しますが、実はいま似たようなことが起きようとしているのをご存知でしょうか?\n\n* Mt.Gox事件のBitcoin返還\n\n供給量の変化によってもたらされる影響について懸念されているものの一つとして、8年前に人気だった取引所「Mt.Gox」から多くのBitcoinが盗まれたMt.Gox事件があります。\n\n事件によって失われた137,000BTCが返還されようとしています。\n\nBitcoinの供給量から見ると1%未満なものの、実際のところ毎日100%が現物で取引されて循環しているわけではないので、相当な売り圧になるとの予測もあります。\n\n自分も市場価格に大きな影響を与えると感じており、この件に関してはツイートもしくはmirrorに改めて投稿します。\n\n### 希少性の維持\n\n希少性が維持される条件として、上で挙げたBitcoinの方法など主に3つ存在します。\n\n* 最大供給量の決める（固定する）\n* 一部をBurnするトークン設計\n* トークンの紛失（いわゆるセルフGox）\n\nトークノミクスが不十分なものは、最大供給量および供給を定期的にコントロールして減らす仕組みがない事が多い。\n\n### Burnするトークン設計\n\nトークンは発行（Mint）とは逆の焼却（Burn）をすることもできます。\n\nやっていることは、自社株を買い戻しているのと似ています。\n\nこの仕組を採用している主要な暗号資産にはEthereumやBNBなどが挙げられる。今回はEthereumを例に見てみましょう。\n\n* Ethereum\n\nEthereumのマイナー報酬は大きく分けて、Static Base Reward（基礎報酬）の2ETHと、トランザクション手数料のチップの2種類が存在し、それらの合計がマイナーに支払われます。\n\n上のBurnの仕組みになったのはEIP-1559。手数料（ガス代）のマーケットメカニズムの変更に伴い、トランザクション手数料のチップを除くBase Fee（基本手数料）の部分をBurnする仕組みなりました。\n\nEIP-1559が採用されてからはEthereumのインフレの進行は遅まるどころかデフレトークンになりました。デフレトークンについては下で改めて説明しています。\n\nこのような形で、定期的もしくは何かをトリガーにBurnする仕組みを採用することで意図的に供給量のコントロールを行うこともできます。\n\n### 供給量＜供給率と時間軸\n\nここまで供給について話してきましたが、あくまで重要なのはトークンの総数ではないです。\n\n* 現在のトークン供給量\n* 現在のトークン供給率\n* 残りのトークンを発行する時間軸\n\nこの3つがトークンの供給にかかわる数字、要するに指標として存在します。\n\n仮にあるトークンの設計として、最大供給量を1億枚に設定していたとします。しかし、いまは30%の3000万枚しか市場に出回っていません。この場合は、残りの70%が大きな売り圧などになる可能性があり、トークンの価格に影響を与える可能性が大きくなってしまいます。\n\nそこで時間をかけてトークンを残りの発行してみます。トークンの残り70%を10年かけて放出したとしましょう。その場合、トークン放出による市場価格への影響はかなり小さいと言えるでしょう。\n\nでも70%を向こう1ヶ月で放出する場合はどうでしょう。最悪ですね、大きな売り圧になります。\n\nこのように供給量よりも供給率と時間軸が設計の上で非常に重要になってきます。\n\n### インフレトークン\n\n上でトークノミクスの悪い例として挙げたものの中にインフレトークンを言うものが存在します。\n\n* 供給量が一定じゃない\n* 無限に供給（発行）される\n* Burnの設計が一切ない\n\n供給量の増加に比例し、価値が減少する。いわゆるインフレですね。\n\nDOGEがその代表的な例として挙げられます。供給率は一定数（1分毎に1万枚）で、流通量に上限はありません。\n\n### デフレトークン\n\nインフレトークンとは反対にデフレトークンも存在します。\n\n* 供給量が一定\n* 供給量が減少していく\n* Burnの設計がされている\n\nデフレトークンは供給量を制限し、希少性を高めるという意味でとても良いことです。\n\n### 時価総額とFDV\n\n現在のトークンの価値を測る指標として、トークンの価格の他に時価総額とFDVが存在します。\n\n時価総額は聞き慣れている言葉だと思いますが、FDVはどうでしょう。\n\n* 時価総額\n\n時価総額とは、現在流通している額の総数で、現在の価格×**流通量**で計算できます。\n\n* FDV\n\nFDVとは、Fully Diluted Valuationの略で、日本語では完全希薄化価格といい、今後流通予定のものを含んだ数量の額の総数を指します。現在の価格×**最大供給量**で計算できます。\n\nここからは上の2つを例を上げて具体的に見ていきましょう。\n\n例えばあるトークンAの現在の価格が1ドルだとします。100枚のトークンが流通しており、最大供給量は1,000枚です。\n\nこの場合、時価総額は1×100で100ドル。FDVは1×1000で1,000ドルとなります。\n\n### 時価総額とFDVの比率\n\n時価総額とFDVの比率は、現在供給済みのトークンの割合を示します。\n\nトークンAの場合は1000÷100で10になり、より1に近い小さい数のほうが残りの供給量が少ないです。現在進行形で放出が進んでいるBitcoinは2100÷1910で1.099でかなり1に近い数字です。\n\n時価総額とFDVに大きな差がある場合は、この比率が大きくなり、まだ供給予定のトークンの多くがロックされており時間が経過するごとに放出され希薄化が進みます。\n\nどちらかといえば、プロジェクト運営側というよりもユーザー側の視点になりますが、供給の時間軸（タイミングやスケジュール）、どこからどこに供給れるものなのかを確認しておくことが賢いです。\n\nプロジェクトの成長速度より早いトークン供給によるインフレは大きな売り圧になります。\n\nなので運営側もそこは気をつけて設計する必要があるでしょう。\n\n### トークンアロケーション\n\n過度な供給や集中する供給が価格に対して与えるダメージが大きいことはここまで説明してきました。\n\n過度な供給は仕組みで防げますが、集中する供給はMt.Gox事件しか話してませんでした。\n\n起こりうる事例として実際どのようなものがあるでしょう。トークンの販売の部分から見てみます。\n\n* プライベートセール\n* フェアローンチ\n\nプライベートセールの場合、ローンチ時のトークン価格よりも大幅に割り引かれていることが多く、個人投資家以外にもVCなどがこのラウンドから投資を行いますが、権利が確定するまでには一定期間のロックアップが存在することが一般的です。COINLISTのIEOに参加経験のある人はわかりやすいと思います。\n\nこの場合、ロック期間が終わったときに一定の売り圧が発生する可能性が高くなります。\n\n一部回避する方法として、ロックアップ解除の時期をずらしたり、従来より長いロックアップ期間を許容してくれる投資家に対して、割引や多くステーキング報酬を付与インセンティブを付与する対処を行っています。\n\nこのような情報はCoinGeckoやCoinMarketCap等のサイトには載ってないことが多いので、代わりに公式のドキュメント等を見に行く必要があります。\n\n### VCが生み出す売り圧\n\nすべてのVCが圧力になるとは限りません。あるティア1クリプトVCは、「ロック期間が終わっても一切トークンを売ることはない。」と話してたような、してないような。\n\nトークンを手放す条件、要するに利確を行う条件として下記が考えられます。\n\n* 市況の悪化\n* 運用ファンドの不調\n* ロック解除時のインフレ率\n\nなど、アンロック時に売るインセンティブがどうしても強くなる状況がある。ここは運営側で制御できない部分の不可抗力も大きく、売られることを防ぐことは難しい。では、対策として何ができるのか。\n\n### 初期供給量の調整\n\n初期供給量を少なくしてしまえば、売られる額が市場供給量と比べて相対的に少なくなるから価格変動を極限まで押さえられるのではないか！実はこれは間違っています。\n\n硬い投資家はなぜBitcoinやEthereumを選ぶのか。それは希少性による資産性ですよね。これからの供給による希薄化が少ない、要するにHODLするインセンティブ（値上がりへの期待）の方が大きく、今手放すインセンティブが少ない設計に見せることができているからです。\n\n極端な話、初期供給量が10%のトークンの場合残りの90%を徐々に供給していく形となります。そうなると初期供給量が10%より大きいトークンよりも、初期投資家に与えるダメージは同じ成長度のプロジェクトだとしても比較して大きいと言えるでしょう。\n\n### 供給のトークン設計の分析方法\n\n投資家は下記項目を重点的に見る必要があり、運営サイドも注意する必要がある。\n\n1. トークンの流通量\n2. 供給量の上限があるかどうか\n3. ロックアップ解除のタイミングと割合\n4. Burnの設計を採用しているかどうか\n5. トークン供給のメカニズム\n6. トークンのインフレ率\n7. 供給増加による売却インセンティブ\n8. ロック解除時のインフレ率\n\n### トークノミクスで生み出すトークンの需要\n\nここまではいずれも、トークンの供給に関するもので、ここからはトークンの需要について見ていきましょう。\n\nどんなに供給のメカニズムを工夫して希少価値のあるものができたとしても、需要がなければなんの価値も生まれません。\n\nいま私が寝起きのセルフィーをNFTとしてミントしました。今後追加での発行予定はなく紛れもない1/1です。いままでの話を見ていると、この上なく最高の希少性だとわかりますが、誰もこんなもの要りません。\n\n需要とは様々な条件によって成り立っているのです。\n\n* 今後生まれる価値と収入\n* 実用性があるかどうか\n* 投機、ミームなど\n\n需要を適切にコントロール下に置くことで、リスクを取ってくれた初期参入者に対してインセンティブを発生させたり、トークン価格の上昇として還元することはどのプロジェクトも取り組むべき事項の一つです。\n\n### ユーティリティ\n\nユーティリティには様々な形が存在します。\n\n* 問題を解決するプロダクトやサービス\n* ガス代（チェーンのネイティブトークンなど）\n* プロトコルで利用されるトークン（ガバナンストークンなど）\n* 楽しみの提供（GameFi、音楽など）\n* コミュニティやイベント（BAYCなど）\n\n### 利回りなどのインセンティブ\n\nトークンを保有することによって報酬を得ることができる仕組みは大きな需要に繋がります。\n\nたとえば、RocketPoolでETHをステーキングすると4.03%、Lidoだと3.9%のAPRで報酬がもらえます。\n\nまた単なる金銭的な報酬だけじゃない場合も存在します。\n\n### ガバナンス\n\nトークンを保有するメリットとして、ガバナンスの権利が得られるというものがある。\n\nしかしこれは一般的なホルダーからして果たして魅力的なものなのだろうか?\n\n一定数の需要はあるにしろ。ユーティリティがコレだけでは盛り上がりにかける。\n\n### 高いAPY\n\n魅力的に見えるように高いAPYを見せて人とお金を集める手法がある。\n\n実際魔界などの別名を持ち人とお金が集まっているのでれっきとした需要と言えます。\n\nしかし、このAPYは一時的なものでお金が2倍流入すると半分の利回りになる。いくつかのプロトコルでは利回りを保証するものもあるがごく一部です。\n\n高いAPYは非常に魅力的だがリスクも存在する。\n\n利回りは低下する上に、トークンの価格も供給量が無限に増加していくので低下していくことが予想される。売ることもロクにできないゴミを保有しているも同然になることも多い。\n\nちゃんとしたサービスをローンチしたい場合は運営はなるべく避けるべき判断であることは確か。しかし設計によっては高APYも提供可能になるかも。\n\n### リベース\n\nこの手法はOlympusが導入したもので、株式分割に非常に似ています。\n\nホルダーは従来どおり、ステーキングを行うことでトークンを報酬として受け取ることができます。\n\nしかし供給は増加を続けるので、希薄分をステーキングしたトークンで受け取ることで事実上の保有比率を変えずとも運用可能にしました。\n\nいまでも高い290%の利回りを提供していますが、去年末は8,000%以上の高APYでした。\n\n### Airdrop\n\n特定の条件を満たすユーザーにトークンを無料で配布する手法です。\n\nコアなファンを作る意味でも、金銭的なインセンティブが得られるという期待感からも、運営・ユーザー共に人気の昔からある手段です。\n\nトークンを保有もしくはステーキングすることで、Airdropの対象になるケースや、抽選で配布を行うパターンがよく見られますが、先行利用してくれているユーザーに配布する事もあれば、自分たちのサービスではない特定のプロトコルを利用しているユーザーにばらまく場合もあります。\n\n最近だとCosmosのエコシステムでのエアドロが人気だとか。\n\n### ステーキングトークン\n\nステーキングして報酬が得られる仕組みはトークンの重要を生み出す仕組みとして非常に有用ですが、その文脈で更にブーストさせる方法が存在します。\n\nステーキングトークンとは、ステーキング及びロックしたトークンと引き換えに発行されるトークンのことです。\n\nスキーキングトークンを担保に暗号資産を借りたり、更に運用することができるのが魅力です。\n\n例えばLidoの場合、1ETHをステーキングすると引き換えに、1stETHを受け取ります。\n\nこの1stETHはDEXに流動性供給をおこないファーミングを行ったり、AAVEではstETHが担保として認められているので、stETHを担保にETHを借りてレバレッジステーキングができます。\n\n普通にステーキングよりもこのような形で更に運用できたほうがより多くの報酬が受け取れるので、トークンの需要は更に増すでしょう。\n\n### 投機とミーム\n\n人はお金が大好きで、もちろん投機も大好きです。私たちのこの感覚と同じように、市場も完全な合理性を持って動いているわけではないのが現状です。\n\n他の人が買っているから、信頼できるインフルエンサーが紹介していたから、前のコレクションも価格が上がったから今回のも買っておけば稼げる、やはりFOMOのようなものもあるだろうか。\n\nミームも一種の投機ではないか。クリプトは今までミームによって多大な恩恵を受けてきました。\n\n先程インフレトークンの代表的なものとして紹介したDOGEがはトークノミクスの観点から見ると明らかにクソトークンですが、時価総額10位に位置しています。国内取引所にも上場しています。\n\nそれは何を意味するのか、クリプトはコミュニティ主導で動いている。ミームそのものなのではないかと。\n\nミームによってブーストできる力もあるとして、一定数自分たちの追い風にしないといけないのかもしれない。\n\nいくら頑張って開発しても、ミーム＞トークノミクスの構造に自ずとなってしまっているものも多く存在する。\n\n* プロジェクトに対する強い愛\n* Discordでの活発さ\n* コミュニティに興奮はあるか\n\nこの3つがコミュニティを調査した上でいかにミーム的な付加価値を手供できるかどうかの重要なポイントとになりそうです。\n\n## さいごに\n\nここまでつらつらと書き連ねましたがこんな事をすべて考えて、念入りにトークンの設計をできるだろうか。自分でも書いていてめっちゃ難しいなあという認識です笑\n\nどれだけ完璧だと思う設計をしても、不可抗力や予期せぬことで価格の上下は少なからず起こるもの。\n\nでも完璧に近いトークノミクスを実現するため、経済学に詳しい教授などがトークノミクスのアドバイザーとしてプロジェクトに参画しているのをみてびっくりしました。\n\n価格の上下にユーザーと自分たちのモチベーションが振り回される環境で果たして「このサービスにトークンは必要なのか」問題は、個人的にめっちゃ話したいですがここで話すと長くなるのでまた別の機会に。\n\n長々と話しましたが少しでも参考になると幸いです。また、今回の記事にご協力いただきました[Covduk氏](https://twitter.com/Cov_duk)には改めて感謝します。ぜひフォローしてください！ではまた次のmirrorで会いましょう。\n\n\n---\n\nThank you so much Covduk! 😄\n\n協力: **[Covduk氏](https://twitter.com/Cov_duk)** / **[Tokenomicsのスレッド](https://twitter.com/Cov_duk/status/1547857503739711488)**", "timestamp": 1658145896, "digest": "A_4Zl4x_peQrMmAccPzpQfBDBoyIm8DX8kwc9N-n96U", "contributor": "0xcdaF4F9f8F9141a162f9CA7566FbaCD9237718b8"}

"「flipper访谈计划」是我们和多个NFT二级交易者的访谈合集。我们致力于对话各种风格的交易者，为二级市场交易抽丝剥茧，分享他们赚钱的经历，帮助更多NFT玩家实现稳定盈利。\n\nMartin是币圈老玩家，17年大学没毕业就踏入币圈，一举获得百倍收益，从EOS到合约无不涉猎。21年进入NFT领域，荷兰拍阶段入手红豆，之后都是翻十倍以上出手，仅凭一个项目就获得了超过50ETH的收益。Martin在Web3各个领域的经验，让他非常擅长从项目的初始阶段挖掘项目的潜力，Martin的社群在中文社区最早布局沙特白单，有社群成员通过邀请白单获得10个白单，收益20ETH以上。他还从白单阶段布局了godhates、火把等项目，都获得了不错的收益，也证明了他对项目的判断独特而精准。\n\n这次Martin和我们的访谈聚焦NFT领域从入门到精通各个阶段最应该做的事，和最应该学会的技巧。包括新手入门的方法，早期发现项目的技巧，和二级市场逃顶的方法论。相信不论你是刚进入NFT领域的新手，还是已经了解NFT一段时间的进阶玩家，都能在这篇访谈中得到一些技巧和答案。\n\n## 一 入门 对新手的建议\n\n对于新手来说，从一级市场拿白做起是一个比较好的方式，因为新手大多资金量有限，盲目从大项目开始买可能并不理智。那么，新手应该选择什么样的项目开始拿白和参与？可以看三点：\n\n### 1. 过于PUA的项目不做\n\n很多项目方有一个牛市遗留下来的习惯，就是要求用户做很多任务来获取白名单，包括邀请许多人进DC，在DC不断发言提升等级等等。这种方式拿白费时费力，在牛市的确可能赚钱，但在现今的熊市并不适用。以Martin的经验，这种过于PUA的项目方，往往最终发行的项目质量并不很高，因为他们只会通过比较原始的手段绑定用户，其营销能力令人质疑。而且肝白的时间给不了你任何成长，可以说毫无意义。\n\n相反，我们推荐新手做更容易获取白单的项目，比如评论邀请几个好友，顺手转发一下推特，或者在premint网站上登记一下地址，或者进DC频道发一下地址等。这种白单任务一两分钟就可以搞定，效率很高，能降低你的时间成本，把更多时间用来学习新知识，看新的项目。\n\n### 2. premint多准备几组账号\n\n许多针对新手的建议会说，多准备几个钱包用来打土狗，而Martin建议不仅钱包要准备多个，配套的twitter帐号和DC账号也要准备多个。特别是twitter账号，一定要准备和钱包相同的数量。\n\n因为现在众多优质项目都选择使用premint的方式抽白，同时在premint抽奖大多需要独立的钱包和推特。所以准备的账号组越多，获得白单的机会越高，赚取收益的可能性也就越大。\n\n### 3. 优先关注free mint的项目\n\n对新手来说，最应该优先关注的是freemint的项目。主要原因有二：\n\n一是freemint项目成本可控，即使打多个，也只需要付出gas，即使项目没起来也不会亏太多，风险比较小。\n\n二是一些付费mint的项目，其实质量上并没有比freemint项目高，反而项目方会因为付费mint获得的利益，在mint之后懈怠对项目的运作，这肯定对项目的长远发展不利，也会削弱项目的价值。最终反应到市场上，就是NFT价格下跌甚至归零。所以付费mint并不代表项目质量一定高，看项目还是要从各个方面综合判断。\n\n## 二 进阶 如何判断项目是否优质\n\n那么如何判断项目的质量？Martin向我们总结了三点：\n\n### 1. 通过项目方的外宣初步判断\n\n一级市场的项目，很多都会有预热，这时可以快速浏览一下项目方的推特，以及项目的相关信息，比如有没有知名的KOL或者共同关注点赞。同时也要关注项目的画风，到项目官网去看一下整体的构架等等，然后再决定是否mint。一般项目的官网的精良程度也决定了一个项目的精良程度，如果官网都做不好，项目大概率也不太行。\n\n同时也不能仅仅依靠推特粉丝来判断推，因为特粉丝这种东西比较虚，如果一个项目粉丝很多，但是没什么大V和KOL关注，也没有共同关注的好友，那么项目的粉丝极大概率是刷的。另外，推特下的评论互动也很重要，有的项目评论中一看就知道是机器人，这种项目方就大概率没什么运营水平。\n\n### 2. 通过创新度进一步判断\n\n优秀的项目一定要有创新度。比如哥布林，在哥布林之前，大家都认为NFT要「好看」，但哥布林打破了这个常规。而且哥布林本身的绘图质量很高，为后续的爆火提供了前提。可以说，哥布林的火，很大程度上取决于画风的创新和精美。\n\n而创新本身很难去定义，但当它出现的时候你就能发现。又如前段时间起飞的沙特人，它像素风的图可能第一眼并不陌生，看起来普普通通，但它是第一个把NFT主体定位到沙特地区文化的，这就是很好的创新，而后续的爆火基本是必然。\n\n所以考察NFT的质量，创新是必不可少的一个因素，而创新也是多维度的，不是只有图片创新，在合约，营销，运营，项目故事等任何一个方面有创新都有潜力。有创新性的NFT，几乎天生就比其他NFT优越，遇到这种项目一定不能错过。\n\n### 3. 通过社区获得优质信息\n\n在NFT圈，优质信息往往通过alpha群等核心圈子传播，这种优质社区中的信息价值非常高，往往在项目发布前就能判断出项目质量和后续走势。Martin自己也是Godjira和doodles社群的成员，同时也是优质信息的传播节点，成立了自己的社群。\n\n在社群中获得信息拥有极大优势，因为社群节约了你的时间成本和筛选环节，能直接把优质信息的传递效率提升到最高。如果你还未加入社群，也可以从Martin的推特和社群，或b4fomo的社群开始获得优质信息，迈出进入NFT核心圈的第一步。\n\n如果你通过这几点，判断出了某个项目是有质量的，那么就可以果断出手。不需要过于害怕亏损不敢mint，因为一级市场项目许多都是freemint，成本很低，可以不断试错，而抓住一次机会就能翻很多倍，盈亏比非常高。\n\n## 三 大成 土狗的逃顶策略\n\n经过mint阶段，下一步要做的就是在二级市场出手。这个阶段也是难度最高的，许多NFT玩家不是出手过早卖在低点，就是一直持有直到项目归零。那么如何判断出手的时机？怎样才能出在高点，获得最高的利润？Martin分享了以下三点技巧：\n\n### 1. 入手项目时接多个\n\nNFT和虚拟货币不同，如果只入手一个或者两个，很难做出理性的判断，涨上去想出手又害怕会继续上涨，价格出现下跌又会出现恐慌抛售。为了避免这种不理性的决策，在mint的时候就要尽量多买几只。尤其是对于free mint的项目，本身也没什么成本，这样下判断时才能更从容不迫，获得最大利益。\n\n对于看好的项目，Martin习惯一次接20个左右，这样分批出的时候更游刃有余，比如最近的BALUBA，Martin计算出单只成本3u左右，而这个项目的画风和热度都不错，很有潜力。于是果断mint了20个，即使中间有人砸盘也并不受影响，持有到高点0.04出手，分批出货，平均收益达到了15倍。\n\n### 2. 分批出货，对土狗不能有信仰\n\n对土狗来说，出货的好点位有两个。\n第一个点位是0.02-0.03，这个阶段适合用来回本，当你mint了多个时，可以在这时出掉一部分来回本，保证自己能全身而退。\n第二个点位是0.08-0.1，因为大部分free mint项目很难突破0.1，所以在项目冲到0.08到0.1这个阶段时，可以考虑分批出一些，带来一些盈利。\n\n而在项目出现向下的态势时，就需要考虑及时出货止损。如果你在0.02到0.03阶段已经出了一部分，其实已经覆盖了成本，所以这时候做决策会很从容，无论是留一个全出，还是再观望一段时间，实际上你都是不会亏的。\n\n如果看好项目的未来，决定长期持有，需要注意的是不能被项目方的信息带着走，盲目高估项目未来的价值。在目前的NFT市场，蓝筹是极少数，大多项目都只能火一段时间，当热度过去就没有了买盘，相当于砸在了手里。所以对土狗不能有信仰，按商业逻辑看待项目，才是理性的交易者应该做的。\n\n### 3. 从项目数据判断逃顶时机\n\n最准确判断逃顶时机的方法，还是从数据角度判断。一般挂单越来越多，而买盘开始走弱的时候，项目就到了短期的一个高点，这时候出手可以卖在顶部。\n\n同时，逃顶也要看点位。 当项目价格突破一个价格点位，比如上面提到的0.03，0.1等关键点位时，这个点位会变成支撑位，这个时候一般说明买盘良好，可以多持有看看，当发现买盘衰竭，也就是买单速度下降、买单数量减少时，再进行出手操作；而当项目跌破了支撑点位时，这个点位会变成压力位，短期内再冲上的可能性会变弱，这时挂单价格就需要谨慎，挂在高点很可能难以出手，可以尽快挂当前的地板价快速变现。\n\n而这些实时数据，在OS上是看不到的，所以必须配合工具来看。Martin常用的工具是parsec，同时也用b4fomo，parsec的优点是更专业，K线图和走势清晰，更适合资深玩家和有其他领域交易经验的交易者，b4fomo信息更全面，更适合新手。具体使用什么工具，可以结合自身的交易情况、对NFT交易的了解程度等等来决定。\n\n像买盘和卖盘的比例，价格点位分布，在b4fomo都能清晰地看到。而且b4fomo也有free mint的功能，帮助NFT玩家迅速找到市场上正在mint的所有土狗项目，并可以使用工具一键在合约端mint，既别别人快，还比别人安全。\n\n在访谈的过程中，Martin非常诚恳地介绍了他的NFT经验，这种共建共享的Web3精神也让我们钦佩。同时，Martin也在他的推特 <https://twitter.com/martin23_sen> 中分享他看好的优质项目，也组建了自己的社群，带着伙伴们一起从早期掘金。访谈最后，Martin对我们说，即使现在市场整体处于熊市，但NFT领域始终是局部的热点，不断会有机会涌现，任何在这个领域持续耕耘的人，会在之后的牛市获得意想不到的收获。\n\n您也可以在 <https://www.b4fomo.io/>

{"id": "bdG-6SGkDAPAJ_1quLCzhYy8GfBgMW5UAkOo-RMhNJ4", "title": "Analysis on NFT Liquidity: Problems & Solutions", "body": "## Introduction\n\nRecent waves of liquidation have triggered contagion fears in the crypto market, spreading from Three Arrows Capital to crypto lenders like Celsius Network, Babel Finance, BlockFi and Voyager Digital. Billions of dollars have been wiped off the market in the past few weeks due to the collapses and the slump in digital asset prices.\n\nLiquidity issue is not only fatal to the development of DeFi but also (if not more of) such a case in NFT. In this report we will focus on NFT liquidity problems and solutions as it is seen as the major gateway to web3 given its lower threshold and more diverse use cases.\n\n## This report will cover the following topics:\n\nI. Briefly describe current liquidity problems in NFTs\n\nII. Why is there insufficient liquidity for NFTs?\n\nIII. What are the existing solutions for NFT liquidity?\n\nIV. Other thoughts for NFT liquidity solutions\n\nV. Closing thoughts\n\n## I. What are the NFT Liquidity Problems?\n\nDespite NFT’s exuberance in 2021 and early 2022, the level of NFT transaction activity can only be described as lukewarm compared to DeFi. [Top 15 NFT marketplaces](https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces) have taken up the absolute majority of the global NFT market share and yet its aggregate trading volume is sub-2% of that of [decentralized crypto exchanges](https://dune.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics), let alone centralized exchanges which [reported a whopping $14trn+](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nsav-announces-completion-major-upgrades-150900024.html#:\\~:text=Centralized%20crypto%20exchanges%20reported%20more,as%20of%20December%2024%2C%202021.) in trading volume in 2021.\n\n![Data is updated as of Jul 6, 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySnL5A7pUUeWFbipnTWIS.png?height=288&width=919)\n\nThe NFT market fluctuations contributed by the current whale centralization also adds up to the liquidity problem. Across most of Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces, 0.06% of whales (with $1mn+ NFT holding value) hold NFTs worth $5.7bn and take up 25.7% of the $22.2bn global NFT market cap [as of Jul 6, 2022](https://nftgo.io/whale-tracking/list).\n\n![Data is updated as of Jul 6, 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BzmtrW9e3LBHHO-XQb8qy.png?height=92&width=649)\n\n## II. Why is NFT Liquidity Insufficient?\n\n(1) What sets non-fungible tokens (NFTs) apart from fungible tokens is its uniqueness in rarities and utilities. While fungible token investors can easily trade tokens like Ethereum and Solana via DEXs / AMMs, the pool of buyers for each NFT sale is much smaller and hence the relatively smaller trading volume shown above. \n\n(2) NFT, despite its huge imagination with the narrative of ‘moving’ current physical assets on-chain, is still very novel to the mass market. The lack of historical data points and widely accepted valuation analysis is a key reason for the high speculation and pricing difficulty. Even NFTs within the same collection can be valued at significantly different prices due to rarity stats and subjective opinions. This leads to the low liquidity and unideal capital efficiency.\n\n(3) Similar to illiquid assets like real estates, blue-chip NFTs are listed at a high price range of US$11K-120K on average even amid the bear market. The high entry price has caused many novel investors losing their appetites, giving rise to the advocate of NFT Fractionalization, which we will discuss in the section later.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RnFVVDwFvWSq8HDCa3V3K.png?height=674&width=1156)\n\n(4) Many NFT investors are investing with a diamond hands strategy and are not willing to sell their NFTs in exchange of immediate liquidity. Hence, the development of NFT financialization is a much heated topic when it comes to resolving NFT liquidity problems.\n\n## III. Existing NFT Liquidity Scaling Solutions\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ni8Mm4sSWYskjDQuNOtkz.png?height=999&width=1456)\n\n### Category A: NFT Trading & Value-adding Protocols\n\nThe market has seen the touting of these DApps and infrastructure protocols to facilitate NFT peer-to-peer trading in a smoother and less costly way: 1) NFT marketplace aggregators, 2) price discovery tools, 3) decentralized NFT trading protocols, and 4) NFT fractionalization.\n\n#### (1) NFT marketplace aggregators \n\nNFT marketplace aggregators are likely the most notable ones among current NFT liquidity solutions. An ggregator platform consolidates NFT listings across most of NFT marketplaces and provides unprecedented visibility to NFT investors. Moreover, by allowing users to make bulk purchase it saves them gas fees by up to \\~40%. Currently, the top 3 aggregator brands are Gem ([acquired by OpenSea](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-gem-to-invest-in-pro-experience/)), Genie ([acquired by Uniswap Labs](https://uniswap.org/blog/genie)) and Flip.\n\n![Gem, Genie, Flip](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IJ08mDCguNzRSSbv8Zc1i.png?height=468&width=1456)\n\nThe recent acquisitions of [Gem](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-gem-to-invest-in-pro-experience/) and [Genie](https://uniswap.org/blog/genie) show that aggregators are an effective front-end tool for individual marketplaces / DeFi pools to gain user traffic. They also allow for lower gas fees via bulk purchases and reduce frictions for NFT buyers. But despite the hype around NFT aggregators this year, they’re fundamentally akin to Deliveroo / Booking.com in web2 as they only aggregate information like NFT listing and pricing without injecting additional liquidity into the NFT market. \n\n#### (2) Price discovery tools\n\nThis type of tools has emerged to solve the pricing difficulty and high speculation of NFTs, assisting users with their investing decisions. Furthermore, price discovery helps lay a crucial foundation for the development of NFT financialization. Unlike fungible tokens where the market prices are easily synced, NFT’s pricing is much trickier as the bid, ask and realized price can be rather inconsistent given its P2P trading feature.\n\nCurrently, there’re several price discovery methodologies:\n\n**(a) Auctions** particularly suit NFTs with high ticket values as they do in the traditional world. Opposite to the traditional English style with an ascending pricing model, Dutch auction that adopts a descending price method is widely adopted in NFT auctions where artists and auctioneers inform all potential collectors and gather all their bidding prices ahead of the auction to set the ceiling price. Then the auction will start at the ceiling price and drop by XX% for every predetermined period of time until all NFT collections get sold out at bidders’ designated bidding prices. \n\nAuctions are in favor of NFT issuers but the market capital efficiency is hugely sacrificed for an accurate pricing result, given that they lock up bidders’ capital which in aggregate mostly likely surpass the value of the NFT being bidded for.\n\n**(b) NFT oracles** like Chainlink can retrieve NFT collections’ floor prices from blockchains and compute their time weighted average prices (TWAP). This can provide investors with a reference price range by tracking the average prices.\n\nHowever, its limit is it requires a huge transaction amount for the TWAP to be accurate and for that reason it’s also susceptible to oracle attacks and market manipulations.\n\n**(c) Machine learning-driven algorithms** serve well for NFT collections with relatively abundant data points (e.g. rarity stats and traits) as it’s more effective to utilize quantitative analysis to do the price prediction.\n\nFor instance, NFTBank, an integrated NFT asset management firm, provides price discovery for \\~1,900 NFT projects. It’s powered by a machine learning model with data inputs such as NFT metadata, sales history, trait values, categories, time of sales and more.\n\nAnother example is Upshot, which has developed specialized machine learning algorithms that ingest historical sales data, secondary market data, and NFT metadata to generate reliable appraisals. Using the algorithms, Upshot reprices 270K+ top NFT items including Bored Apes, Art Blocks and CryptoPunks every hour.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ri3-203yGo4Fw2jSX73hi.png?height=502&width=764)\n\nSince ML-driven algorithms require a large amount of data points to arrive at computational results, it’s more meaningful for NFT collections with rich historical sales data, rarity stats and traits, and lower volatility. Investors may find it inaccurate for newly minted NFT projects that have less comparable traits in the market.\n\n**(d) Peer-based appraisals** include both mechanisms of 1) manual voting/recommendation and 2) behavior analysis and prediction. It’s hard to compute quantitative results for NFTs that are more subjectively priced like digital arts and thus collective judgment is probably a more reliable type of appraisal for such types.\n\nThe above-mentioned project, Upshot, also has its own NFT appraisal protocol that has established a set of data by incentivizing users to provide honest feedback and recommendations for NFT projects. It has built out the API for developers to integrate their data into various projects.\n\n#### (3) Decentralized NFT trading protocols\n\nOpenSea has announced in mid-June to migrate to Seaport Protocol, an open-source web3 marketplace protocol designed for safely and efficiently trading NFTs. OpenSea has moved one step ahead of its centralized DeFi peers by launching the protocol that features \\~35% lower gas fees, discloses on-chain transactions transparently and allows for forking by other developers.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/66x-rasPvYHxPzw_73sy4.png?height=637&width=1456)\n\nThis move lowers the threshold for developers to build their own NFT marketplaces and moves transaction data on-chain. It may remove the pain points of many existing NFT tooling platforms as they can build their own marketplaces on top of Seaport Protocol, capturing value off their existing user base who normally come to find alphas and then switch to other marketplaces/aggregators for execution.\n\nHowever, given the novelty of this protocol, whether it can actually create a liquidity network effect among the NFT tooling platforms is yet to be examined. One thing is for sure, we look to see more development in the space of permissionless NFT trading protocols.\n\n#### (4) NFT fractionalization \n\nNFT fractionalization means splitting a given NFT into multiple pieces which can be individually traded in the market. The process involves a s smart contract that divides ERC-721 tokens into a number of F-NFTs or fungible ERC-20 tokens. Since these ERC-20 tokens can be tapped into DeFi systems and valued by the market via yield farming on AMMs, it can hugely improve the price discovery and liquidity. Another more apparent reason is it encourages decentralization and democratization by allowing normal investors to gain exposure to otherwise high-value NFT items.\n\n![The splitting of a CryptoPunk NFT into 100 ERC-20 tokens](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ms6mLS4JpzGlC9uB0RAq-.png?height=282&width=600)\n\nOne of the most notable projects in this realm is fractional.art. One can connect a web3 wallet to fractional.art to purchase fractionalized NFT items which is in the form of ERC-20 tokens. As a fractionalized NFT token holder, you can participate in the vote of the NFT’s floor price. The platform has also set up a 7-day auction feature which can be triggered when an investor intends to buy up all the fractions of an NFT, i.e. to own the whole piece, so that everyone can participate in the bidding process.\n\nPartyBid, developed by PartyDAO, has an NFT auction platform that supports NFTs on several marketplaces including OpenSea. Anyone can launch a ‘Party’ to contribute ETH to collectively bid for fractions of an NFT. This is achieved via PartyBid’s MarketWrapper contract which provides a general interface to aggregate all NFT bids. PartyBid is built on fractional.art to fractionalize the NFTs that are successfully bidded. Successful bids will get charged a 2.5ETH fee and 2.5% of the token value which will be transferred to the PartyDAO’s vault.\n\n![PartyBid](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G3F-FTZBiq1eQaeY_ri-S.png?height=371&width=1282)\n\nWhile NFT fractionalization may be the next big trend given its positive impact created around democratization and liquidity, it’s not without risk. F-NFTs may give rise to regulatory issues as they are likely treated as unauthorized ICOs. SEC’s commissioner Hester Peirce warned in 2021 that F-NFTs may be considered to be securities. Additionally, managing intellectual property rights and publicity rights can be tricky and complex subject to the traits and types of NFTs.\n\n### Category B: Passive Income for Diamond-Hand NFT Investors\n\nAs we mentioned in the beginning of this report, one of the key factors that contributes to the NFT liquidity problem is investors prefer holding NFT assets and not realizing their profits. To resolve the liquidity issues derived from this behavior, 3 main measures mirrored from existing traditional finance world are aiming to serve these long-term NFT investors: 1) NFT-backed loans/ Collateralized Loan Positions (CDPs), 2) NFT liquidity pools and 3) NFT renting/lending.\n\nBoth of them provide passive income streams and improve capital efficiency for NFT investors while supplying extra liquidity to the market. Also note that many platforms under this category have incorporated the solutions under Category A since they serve for these 2 types of measures in various ways.\n\n#### (1) NFT-backed loans / CDPs\n\nAs compared to the global fine art market where the debt penetration is \\~35% ($24bn/$65bn), NFT debt penetration is only 0.5% (\\~$250mn/$37bn) as of May 1st, 2022 and hence is expected to boost the liquidity as the total market size grows.\n\nThere’re 2 types of loan issuers: peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-protocol (P2Protocol). The majority of loans are issued through P2P loan platforms such as NFTFi and Arcade. The rest are issued by P2Pool loan suppliers such as BendDAO, DropsDAO, PineDAO, Goblin Sax and etc.\n\nCurrent total addressable market for NFT-backed loans is over $250mn by loan volumes. With a higher volatility, NFTs loan lenders can get higher expected returns than traditional crypto-backed loans.\n\n**a) P2P NFT-backed lending platforms**. The two largest players in this space are NFTFi and Arcade, of which the aggregate loans issued to date has amounted to \\~$240mn. Currently, only blue-chip NFTs are supported on these P2P platforms given the high volatility and uncertainty in other long-tail NFT items.\n\nNFTFi is built on top of the NFT lending protocol, MetaStreet. It allows NFT owners to borrow wETH or DAI using their NFTs as collaterals and lenders get to earn interests by supplying these loans. NFTFi’s 90-day loans require an APR up to 1,000%  while longer-duration loans’ average at \\~90%. The company has handled a loan volume of [$217mn ](https://dune.com/rchen8/NFTfi)across 13,363 loans since its May-2020 inception (as of Jul 5, 2022). NFTFi charges 5% on lender’s interest revenue upon successful loans (excluding defaulted ones). Some of the collatealized NFT include wrapped Crypto Punks (\\~29% of loans) and BAYC (23% of loans).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sJB-Fpf2ooUJg6cGfVosO.png?height=599&width=1300)\n\nArcade ($20mn) is built on the Pawn protocol and has facilitated \\~$20mn loans since inception in 2022. Other than wETH and DAI, users can also borrow USDC by collateralizing NFTs from the selected [list](https://contracts.arcade.xyz/). Unlike NFTFi, Arcade charges borrowers a fixed 2% of principal upfront when the loan is originated.\n\nNeither of the above P2P lending platforms underwrites any risk and does not rely on algorithmic pricing to scale. However, the scalability is limited by its bespoke loan terms and potentially slower matching as borrowers must wait for counteroffers. \n\n**b) P2Protocol NFT-backed loans**\n\nThe size of P2Protocol lending market is still small ($30mn-$50mn). Major players include BendDAO, Drops, Pine, Goblin Sax, JPEG’d and Defrag. Some lending platforms, e.g. BendDAO, adopt vote-escrow tokenomics to incentivize NFT holders to supply liquidity in various loan pools. Similar to DeFi liquidity pools, they emit governance tokens to boost interest rates for lenders.\n\nTo resolve P2P lending marketplaces’ slow matching issue, P2Protocol lending projects allow for instantaneous time-to-liquidity as the matching process is handled by the protocol. But the downside is automating loan terms requires rich data points such as real-time prices and rarity stats, and hence limiting the NFT selections to the already liquid ones with quantitative properties.\n\nEven with the over-collateralization (50% at least) for NFT-backed loans, NFT-backed lenders still assume a bigger risk than traditional crypto asset-backed loan providers due to a higher possibility of “voluntary” defaults. This happens if borrowers give up on repaying loans when the value of NFT is less than loan amount. To mitigate such risks, accurate price discovery, credit risk analysis and insurance are all crucial value-added services that many lending platforms have integrated or are actively exploring.\n\nInspired by NFT marketplace aggregators, NFT-backed loan aggregators and infrastructures may be on the next trend as NFT lending marketplaces are still fragmented (esp. in P2Protocol). Apart from [MetaStreet](https://metastreet.xyz/) mentioned above, Spice Finance is a newer project that aims to consolidate existing P2Protocol loans onto one single platform by integrating various NFT P2Protocol protocols. On top of that it has built out a machine-learning NFT appraisal tool and credit risk system to underpin the integrated loan platform.\n\nThe biggest risk for such aggregators comes from the high level of integration and composability as the projects inherit the risks of all the underlying applications.\n\n### (2) NFT liquidity pools\n\nNFT liquidity pools can be categorized into staking liquidity pools and trading liquidity pools, which are mirrored from [DeFi liquidity pools](https://www.huobi.com/learn/en-us/what-are-liquidity-pools/). The main variation is users can mint fungible tokens (e.g. ERC-20 tokens) by depositing NFTs of similar traits/floor prices into the same liquidity pool. The fungible tokens are a representation of and can be swapped for any random assets in the pool. Liquidity providers can enjoy faster time-to-liquidity by depositing NFTs, minting corresponding fungible tokens and swapping them easily via DeFi AMMs (e.g. Sushiswap if using NFTX). Apart from NFTX, another key platform is [NFT20](https://nft20.io/). As liquidity pools involve the minting of fungible tokens, this types of services is often times powered by NFT fractionalization protocols.\n\nSame as DeFi, users can arbitrage out an NFT if it’s mispriced and hence facilitate the price discovery. Additionally, liquidity providers usually get LP tokens and can stake them for boosted rewards. Given NFT’s higher volatility and speculation, however, the risk of slippage may be a challenge for both platforms and investors to handle.\n\n### (3) NFT renting \n\nRenting provides another direction for NFT owners to generate passive income. Double Protocol’s ERC-4907 standard has just become the 30th official ERC standard on Ethereum, which takes an innovative approach by adding an ‘expires’ feature that authorizes automatic expiration for the ‘user’. In this way, projects that are built upon ERC-4907 standard can easily segregate users’ ownership from the right of use that will automatically cease upon the end of the renting period. This will fuel up the development of NFT renting and give rise to more derivatives built around it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/za6apYezbkD4dgOQkMS8X.png?height=675&width=1200)\n\nNFT renting can be applicable to a variety of use cases including gaming, art, PFP, membership NFTs and so on. For example, art exhibitions, brands or events may rent out specific digital art NFTs that match with their pop-up shows/events. Or someone who want to join a community for a period of time before making a long-term commitment may rent out a membership NFT for one month (sounds like subscription to paid contents).\n\nThe most promising use case for NFT renting is gaming given the imagination of the size of metaverse. Virtual lands may drive up some hypes as many owners invested in a large amount of lands so that they can count on them to generate passive rental income from different types of uses as the game onboards more users and brands. Furthermore, in-game assets such as skins, gears,  pets, characters and other items are either required to play the game or granting advantages to players. You may find an example from my [article](https://cmsdaisy.medium.com/will-defi-kingdoms-be-the-mega-blockchain-game-in-the-long-term-ddab85d4a650) about how players rent out the Hero characters in the game. In cases where players can’t afford or simply don’t want to buy in-game NFTs due of all sorts of reasons, they will opt for renting, boosting NFT liquidity further.\n\n## IV. Other Thoughts for NFT Liquidity Solutions\n\nWhen it comes to NFT trading, what can drive liquidity further seems to come from communities where users are aligned on tastes and values for the NFT projects that grow out of the community. Often times, the marketplace is a vertical one which is decided by the theme / vibe of the community behind. Such an NFT marketplace is great for NFT projects to exert the tokens’ influence and utilities among community members. Project owners will also have this sense of belongingness and ownership as they can take part in the voting of marketplace design to deliver certain user experience. \n\nDAOs sound like an organic place for such a marketplace to develop especially with the aforementioned Seaport Protocol that lowers the threshold of developing. Additionally, centralized NFT marketplaces are also actively exploring the community features, such as [Coinbase’s beta version](https://nft.coinbase.com/) of its NFT marketplace has a focus on creating a social community for both buyers and sellers.\n\n## V. Closing Thoughts\n\nAll the above liquidity solutions are trying to resolve issues based on the current NFT market size. What drives NFT liquidity fundamentally in the long term will have to come from its own penetration in various industries. \n\nWe are on an exciting journey into the future of NFTs, where we’ve seen prestigious businesses and celebrities from sports, fashion brands, music streaming services and education forming their partnerships with metaverse-like projects and blockchain technologies. The ultimate way to boost the NFT liquidity is through mass adoption. Along the journey of NFT financialization and further adoption, NFT trading platforms are likely to be made subject to more stringent regulations regarding anti-money laundering and security investments.\n\nFasten your seat belt and stay tuned.", "timestamp": 1658146209, "digest": "fy5xHf5GTFEFDqUWIO0ZZAFVG61D6g5yYdWCRLpVDgA", "contributor": "0x520E805E3C91c5A047C67e589476884587978Fd1"}
{"id": "c-z9oSv4OvOuTRCYZzXv7jhM1wpOleE2Hb91faiiTX8", "title": "Analysis on NFT Liquidity: Problems & Solutions", "body": "## Introduction\n\nRecent waves of liquidation have triggered contagion fears in the crypto market, spreading from Three Arrows Capital to crypto lenders like Celsius Network, Babel Finance, BlockFi and Voyager Digital. Billions of dollars have been wiped off the market in the past few weeks due to the collapses and the slump in digital asset prices.\n\nLiquidity issue is not only fatal to the development of DeFi but also (if not more of) such a case in NFT. In this report we will focus on NFT liquidity problems and solutions as it is seen as the major gateway to web3 given its lower threshold and more diverse use cases.\n\n## This report will cover the following topics:\n\nI. Briefly describe current liquidity problems in NFTs\n\nII. Why is there insufficient liquidity for NFTs?\n\nIII. What are the existing solutions for NFT liquidity?\n\nIV. Other thoughts for NFT liquidity solutions\n\nV. Closing thoughts\n\n## I. What are the NFT Liquidity Problems?\n\nDespite NFT’s exuberance in 2021 and early 2022, the level of NFT transaction activity can only be described as lukewarm compared to DeFi. [Top 15 NFT marketplaces](https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces) have taken up the absolute majority of the global NFT market share and yet its aggregate trading volume is sub-2% of that of [decentralized crypto exchanges](https://dune.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics), let alone centralized exchanges which [reported a whopping $14trn+](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nsav-announces-completion-major-upgrades-150900024.html#:\\~:text=Centralized%20crypto%20exchanges%20reported%20more,as%20of%20December%2024%2C%202021.) in trading volume in 2021.\n\n![Data is updated as of Jul 6, 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySnL5A7pUUeWFbipnTWIS.png?height=288&width=919)\n\nThe NFT market fluctuations contributed by the current whale centralization also adds up to the liquidity problem. Across most of Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces, 0.06% of whales (with $1mn+ NFT holding value) hold NFTs worth $5.7bn and take up 25.7% of the $22.2bn global NFT market cap [as of Jul 6, 2022](https://nftgo.io/whale-tracking/list).\n\n![Data is updated as of Jul 6, 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BzmtrW9e3LBHHO-XQb8qy.png?height=92&width=649)\n\n## II. Why is NFT Liquidity Insufficient?\n\n(1) What sets non-fungible tokens (NFTs) apart from fungible tokens is its uniqueness in rarities and utilities. While fungible token investors can easily trade tokens like Ethereum and Solana via DEXs / AMMs, the pool of buyers for each NFT sale is much smaller and hence the relatively smaller trading volume shown above. \n\n(2) NFT, despite its huge imagination with the narrative of ‘moving’ current physical assets on-chain, is still very novel to the mass market. The lack of historical data points and widely accepted valuation analysis is a key reason for the high speculation and pricing difficulty. Even NFTs within the same collection can be valued at significantly different prices due to rarity stats and subjective opinions. This leads to the low liquidity and unideal capital efficiency.\n\n(3) Similar to illiquid assets like real estates, blue-chip NFTs are listed at a high price range of US$11K-120K on average even amid the bear market. The high entry price has caused many novel investors losing their appetites, giving rise to the advocate of NFT Fractionalization, which we will discuss in the section later.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RnFVVDwFvWSq8HDCa3V3K.png?height=674&width=1156)\n\n(4) Many NFT investors are investing with a diamond hands strategy and are not willing to sell their NFTs in exchange of immediate liquidity. Hence, the development of NFT financialization is a much heated topic when it comes to resolving NFT liquidity problems.\n\n## III. Existing NFT Liquidity Scaling Solutions\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ni8Mm4sSWYskjDQuNOtkz.png?height=999&width=1456)\n\n### Category A: NFT Trading & Value-adding Protocols\n\nThe market has seen the touting of these DApps and infrastructure protocols to facilitate NFT peer-to-peer trading in a smoother and less costly way: 1) NFT marketplace aggregators, 2) price discovery tools, 3) decentralized NFT trading protocols, and 4) NFT fractionalization.\n\n#### (1) NFT marketplace aggregators \n\nNFT marketplace aggregators are likely the most notable ones among current NFT liquidity solutions. An ggregator platform consolidates NFT listings across most of NFT marketplaces and provides unprecedented visibility to NFT investors. Moreover, by allowing users to make bulk purchase it saves them gas fees by up to \\~40%. Currently, the top 3 aggregator brands are Gem ([acquired by OpenSea](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-gem-to-invest-in-pro-experience/)), Genie ([acquired by Uniswap Labs](https://uniswap.org/blog/genie)) and Flip.\n\n![Gem, Genie, Flip](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IJ08mDCguNzRSSbv8Zc1i.png?height=468&width=1456)\n\nThe recent acquisitions of [Gem](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-gem-to-invest-in-pro-experience/) and [Genie](https://uniswap.org/blog/genie) show that aggregators are an effective front-end tool for individual marketplaces / DeFi pools to gain user traffic. They also allow for lower gas fees via bulk purchases and reduce frictions for NFT buyers. But despite the hype around NFT aggregators this year, they’re fundamentally akin to Deliveroo / Booking.com in web2 as they only aggregate information like NFT listing and pricing without injecting additional liquidity into the NFT market. \n\n#### (2) Price discovery tools\n\nThis type of tools has emerged to solve the pricing difficulty and high speculation of NFTs, assisting users with their investing decisions. Furthermore, price discovery helps lay a crucial foundation for the development of NFT financialization. Unlike fungible tokens where the market prices are easily synced, NFT’s pricing is much trickier as the bid, ask and realized price can be rather inconsistent given its P2P trading feature.\n\nCurrently, there’re several price discovery methodologies:\n\n**(a) Auctions** particularly suit NFTs with high ticket values as they do in the traditional world. Opposite to the traditional English style with an ascending pricing model, Dutch auction that adopts a descending price method is widely adopted in NFT auctions where artists and auctioneers inform all potential collectors and gather all their bidding prices ahead of the auction to set the ceiling price. Then the auction will start at the ceiling price and drop by XX% for every predetermined period of time until all NFT collections get sold out at bidders’ designated bidding prices. \n\nAuctions are in favor of NFT issuers but the market capital efficiency is hugely sacrificed for an accurate pricing result, given that they lock up bidders’ capital which in aggregate mostly likely surpass the value of the NFT being bidded for.\n\n**(b) NFT oracles** like Chainlink can retrieve NFT collections’ floor prices from blockchains and compute their time weighted average prices (TWAP). This can provide investors with a reference price range by tracking the average prices.\n\nHowever, its limit is it requires a huge transaction amount for the TWAP to be accurate and for that reason it’s also susceptible to oracle attacks and market manipulations.\n\n**(c) Machine learning-driven algorithms** serve well for NFT collections with relatively abundant data points (e.g. rarity stats and traits) as it’s more effective to utilize quantitative analysis to do the price prediction.\n\nFor instance, NFTBank, an integrated NFT asset management firm, provides price discovery for \\~1,900 NFT projects. It’s powered by a machine learning model with data inputs such as NFT metadata, sales history, trait values, categories, time of sales and more.\n\nAnother example is Upshot, which has developed specialized machine learning algorithms that ingest historical sales data, secondary market data, and NFT metadata to generate reliable appraisals. Using the algorithms, Upshot reprices 270K+ top NFT items including Bored Apes, Art Blocks and CryptoPunks every hour.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ri3-203yGo4Fw2jSX73hi.png?height=502&width=764)\n\nSince ML-driven algorithms require a large amount of data points to arrive at computational results, it’s more meaningful for NFT collections with rich historical sales data, rarity stats and traits, and lower volatility. Investors may find it inaccurate for newly minted NFT projects that have less comparable traits in the market.\n\n**(d) Peer-based appraisals** include both mechanisms of 1) manual voting/recommendation and 2) behavior analysis and prediction. It’s hard to compute quantitative results for NFTs that are more subjectively priced like digital arts and thus collective judgment is probably a more reliable type of appraisal for such types.\n\nThe above-mentioned project, Upshot, also has its own NFT appraisal protocol that has established a set of data by incentivizing users to provide honest feedback and recommendations for NFT projects. It has built out the API for developers to integrate their data into various projects.\n\n#### (3) Decentralized NFT trading protocols\n\nOpenSea has announced in mid-June to migrate to Seaport Protocol, an open-source web3 marketplace protocol designed for safely and efficiently trading NFTs. OpenSea has moved one step ahead of its centralized DeFi peers by launching the protocol that features \\~35% lower gas fees, discloses on-chain transactions transparently and allows for forking by other developers.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/66x-rasPvYHxPzw_73sy4.png?height=637&width=1456)\n\nThis move lowers the threshold for developers to build their own NFT marketplaces and moves transaction data on-chain. It may remove the pain points of many existing NFT tooling platforms as they can build their own marketplaces on top of Seaport Protocol, capturing value off their existing user base who normally come to find alphas and then switch to other marketplaces/aggregators for execution.\n\nHowever, given the novelty of this protocol, whether it can actually create a liquidity network effect among the NFT tooling platforms is yet to be examined. One thing is for sure, we look to see more development in the space of permissionless NFT trading protocols.\n\n#### (4) NFT fractionalization \n\nNFT fractionalization means splitting a given NFT into multiple pieces which can be individually traded in the market. The process involves a s smart contract that divides ERC-721 tokens into a number of F-NFTs or fungible ERC-20 tokens. Since these ERC-20 tokens can be tapped into DeFi systems and valued by the market via yield farming on AMMs, it can hugely improve the price discovery and liquidity. Another more apparent reason is it encourages decentralization and democratization by allowing normal investors to gain exposure to otherwise high-value NFT items.\n\n![The splitting of a CryptoPunk NFT into 100 ERC-20 tokens](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ms6mLS4JpzGlC9uB0RAq-.png?height=282&width=600)\n\nOne of the most notable projects in this realm is fractional.art.

F-NFTs may give rise to regulatory issues as they are likely treated as unauthorized ICOs. SEC’s commissioner Hester Peirce warned in 2021 that F-NFTs may be considered to be securities.

To resolve the liquidity issues derived from this behavior, 3 main measures mirrored from existing traditional finance world are aiming to serve these long-term NFT investors: 1) NFT-backed loans/ Collateralized Loan Positions (CDPs), 2) NFT liquidity pools and 3) NFT renting/lending.\n\nBoth of them provide passive income streams and improve capital efficiency for NFT investors while supplying extra liquidity to the market.

Liquidity providers can enjoy faster time-to-liquidity by depositing NFTs, minting corresponding fungible tokens and swapping them easily via DeFi AMMs (e.g. Sushiswap if using NFTX). Apart from NFTX, another key platform is [NFT20](https://nft20.io/). As liquidity pools involve the minting of fungible tokens, this types of services is often times powered by NFT fractionalization protocols.\n\nSame as DeFi, users can arbitrage out an NFT if it’s mispriced and hence facilitate the price discovery. Additionally, liquidity providers usually get LP tokens and can stake them for boosted rewards. Given NFT’s higher volatility and speculation, however, the risk of slippage may be a challenge for both platforms and investors to handle.\n\n### (3) NFT renting \n\nRenting provides another direction for NFT owners to generate passive income. Double Protocol’s ERC-4907 standard has just become the 30th official ERC standard on Ethereum, which takes an innovative approach by adding an ‘expires’ feature that authorizes automatic expiration for the ‘user’. In this way, projects that are built upon ERC-4907 standard can easily segregate users’ ownership from the right of use that will automatically cease upon the end of the renting period. This will fuel up the development of NFT renting and give rise to more derivatives built around it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/za6apYezbkD4dgOQkMS8X.png?height=675&width=1200)\n\nNFT renting can be applicable to a variety of use cases including gaming, art, PFP, membership NFTs and so on. For example, art exhibitions, brands or events may rent out specific digital art NFTs that match with their pop-up shows/events. Or someone who want to join a community for a period of time before making a long-term commitment may rent out a membership NFT for one month (sounds like subscription to paid contents).\n\nThe most promising use case for NFT renting is gaming given the imagination of the size of metaverse. Virtual lands may drive up some hypes as many owners invested in a large amount of lands so that they can count on them to generate passive rental income from different types of uses as the game onboards more users and brands. Furthermore, in-game assets such as skins, gears,  pets, characters and other items are either required to play the game or granting advantages to players. You may find an example from my [article](https://cmsdaisy.medium.com/will-defi-kingdoms-be-the-mega-blockchain-game-in-the-long-term-ddab85d4a650) about how players rent out the Hero characters in the game. In cases where players can’t afford or simply don’t want to buy in-game NFTs due of all sorts of reasons, they will opt for renting, boosting NFT liquidity further.\n\n## IV. Other Thoughts for NFT Liquidity Solutions\n\nWhen it comes to NFT trading, what can drive liquidity further seems to come from communities where users are aligned on tastes and values for the NFT projects that grow out of the community. Often times, the marketplace is a vertical one which is decided by the theme / vibe of the community behind. Such an NFT marketplace is great for NFT projects to exert the tokens’ influence and utilities among community members. Project owners will also have this sense of belongingness and ownership as they can take part in the voting of marketplace design to deliver certain user experience. \n\nDAOs sound like an organic place for such a marketplace to develop especially with the aforementioned Seaport Protocol that lowers the threshold of developing. Additionally, centralized NFT marketplaces are also actively exploring the community features, such as [Coinbase’s beta version](https://nft.coinbase.com/) of its NFT marketplace has a focus on creating a social community for both buyers and sellers.\n\n## V. Closing Thoughts\n\nAll the above liquidity solutions are trying to resolve issues based on the current NFT market size. What drives NFT liquidity fundamentally in the long term will have to come from its own penetration in various industries. \n\nWe are on an exciting journey into the future of NFTs, where we’ve seen prestigious businesses and celebrities from sports, fashion brands, music streaming services and education forming their partnerships with metaverse-like projects and blockchain technologies. The ultimate way to boost the NFT liquidity is through mass adoption. Along the journey of NFT financialization and further adoption, NFT trading platforms are likely to be made subject to more stringent regulations regarding anti-money laundering and security investments.\n\nFasten your seat belt and stay tuned.", "timestamp": 1658146281, "digest": "mEb-WR_p-i-rh-mJrsnMEc8AlUIcR0zgBv4tAGLncYw", "contributor": "0x520E805E3C91c5A047C67e589476884587978Fd1"}

\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9EbW9kSNtG7Fb9m-pawHd.png?height=383&width=900)\n\nArianna Simpson 是科技、游戏和加密货币顶尖风投公司a16z(全称：Andreessen Horowitz)的普通合伙人，她参与投资了各种加密货币和游戏公司，包括Irreverent Labs。她相信区块链技术带来的去中心化的力量，也相信这将引领我们走向元宇宙。\n\na16z拥有6亿美元的专门游戏基金和45亿美元的加密货币基金。Simpson 正在部署这笔资金，但我们也正处于加密货币的低迷时期，以及面临着硬核玩家对NFT的抵制。这让这家公司的风险比几个月前要大得多。在接受GamesBeat的采访时，Simpson 表示a16z准备从长远角度看待这个市场。\n\nGameBeat对Simpson进行了深度专访，探讨了加密货币和游戏的交叉点，她对接受NFT的玩家的看法，为什么玩家应该分享游戏收益，以及为什么a16z的创始人Marc Andreessen和Ben Horowitz看到了这个领域的机会，并向这个领域的特定基金投入了双倍的资金。尽管市场经历了多次过山车式的循环，但这种信念并未改变。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8UskTLlP-s2RPwvcZsc5k.png?height=921&width=640)\n\n*采访对象：顶尖风投公司a16z的普通合伙人 Arianna Simpson \n *以下是此次访谈的文字内容。 \n 提问：你是什么时候开始对这个领域感兴趣的？你是如何发现加密货币和游戏之间的联系的?\n\nSimpson：大约十年前，我掉进了加密货币的兔子洞。我第一次感兴趣是在2013年，当时我在非洲南部旅行。我在六个国家待过一段时间，包括津巴布韦。我目睹了他们经历的恶性通货膨胀的后果。显然，这破坏了经济，迫使他们转向美元以稳定经济。这迫使他们采取激进的措施。\n\n当我回到美国时，我和一个朋友谈到了这个问题，他提到比特币是通货紧缩的，而不是可能过度膨胀的东西。这让我走了很远的路。显然，现在的比特币市场已经远远超出了比特币的范畴。但这只是最初的催化剂。我越深入，就越觉得有趣。这是一个非常丰富的设计空间，汇集了很多领域，从密码学到博弈论到计算机科学等等。\n\n游戏领域是我的基金的核心内容之一。在我加入a16z之前，我创办了一家名为Autonomous Partners的基金。我已经对游戏领域非常感兴趣了。我在这一领域进行了许多投资，包括Mythical和Flow区块链。我联系了Dapper实验室的团队。他们将NFT理念作为游戏体验的一部分，这是值得称赞的，当然，许多其他团队也采用并扩展了这一理念。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m1Xf9tv__KZJo6lasaGIs.png?height=511&width=1080)\n\n我已经深入研究NFT和游戏领域很长时间。看到它们真正开始吸引主流关注，真是令人难以置信。这是2021年的现象。我很期待我们接下来的发展。事实上，我们还只是触及了表面。我们认为web3游戏是一种巨大的催化剂，能够将数千万乃至数亿人带入web3领域。Web3游戏完全可以这样。游戏环境通常会引领技术的发展趋势。我们已经见过很多次了。能够让人们在一个低风险的环境中参与进来，并教育他们为了在这个生态系统中茁壮成长而需要学习的原则，这是非常令人兴奋的。我仍然对这一领域的未来充满期待。\n\n*加密货币价格暴跌*\n\n提问：我知道a16z也有早期的加密货币投资背景，但在某种程度上，像这样一家大型风险投资公司会进入加密货币这样的领域，你会感到惊讶吗？他们是如何推断出这是应该关注的事情的?\n\nSimpson：这家公司，尤其是Mark (Andreessen)和Ben (Horowitz)，值得高度赞扬，因为他们愿意承担在当时看来非常巨大的风险，完全投入到这个领域。在那个时候大多数风投同行都没有这么做。我想加入a16z的原因之一是，这个公司愿意建立专门的独立基金，果断押注自己认定的领域。我并不是在找工作，但这确实让他们比大多数风投同行更突出。\n\n我认为，这家公司多年来对这个领域的信心在大型风投平台中是独一无二的。这让我们能够与最好的创始人合作。创始人希望知道他们的投资者对这个领域有信心。他们不会因为某一天市场的变化而在某一领域中徘徊。Mark、Ben和Chris很早就看到了。这就是我想加入并成为其中一员的原因。\n\n提问：就它最初的吸引力而言，是围绕去中心化的争论，还是其他事情，吸引你们去投资新的想法？\n\nSimpson：在我们的行业中，某种程度上，我们是被动的。我们必须关注伟大的企业家的发展方向。即使在早期，也需要这样。Coinbase的Brian Armstrong，以及其他很多人。即便如此，虽然这是一个很新颖的领域，但你有非常优秀的创始人，他们对这项技术非常感兴趣。同样，我们的投资雷达在某种程度上是受论文驱动的，但也非常受人才驱动。创始人、顶级创始人，在选择加密领域时，我们一直认为这是需要考虑的关键问题。 \n\n提问：你是否经历了两次加密货币寒冬？你经历了多少个寒冬，就加密货币的整体发展而言，你如何看待它们?\n\nSimpson：**周期的长度肯定会随着时间的推移而增加。**早在2013年，一年之内就出现了多个周期。然后，时间轴向外延伸。最重要的一点是专注于技术，而不是过于关注周期。我们已经看到，许多最好的企业——在更广泛的技术领域和加密或具体的web3领域都是如此——都是在市场不稳定时期开始的。我们认为这是一个专注于技术的机会。加密货币面临的挑战之一是有一个报价器，这是早期初创公司所没有的。这会让人分心。但在现实中，在价格活动减弱的时期，可能是专注于建设的绝佳机会。\n\n如果我把我们现在的状况与2018年的衰退相比，就实际建造的东西而言，我们处于一个完全不同的世界。在2018年，很多事情正在进行中，很多Layer 1区块链正在建设，很多基础设施正在建设，远远超过应用程序。基础设施必须放在第一位。在这个领域中，一个人能做的事情还不多。今日不同往日，许多协议已经启动。成百上千的应用程序已经实时可用。游戏，钱包，各种各样的东西。在我看来，这才是最重要的进步。我们已经看到了巨大的进步。\n\n我们还发布了一份加密货币报告，你可能已经看到了。我们用数据绘制出了这个周期的各个部分。虽然它们看起来像是混乱的波动周期，但实际上它们是非常可预测的。周期的每个部分都有其特定的作用，尤其是价格上行的时期吸引人们进入这个领域。热情的投资者蜂拥而至。当潮水退去时，一些人离开了，但他们可能不是建造者。他们可能是投机者。许多核心人才留在了这个领域。这让我们能够为下一波建设做好准备，最终随着创造更多价值，价格会升值。但是周期非常重要。最重要的是专注于技术的开发，显然，这不是一朝一夕就能实现的。\n\n![区块链游戏中的数字土地销售：加密货币寒冬已经开始影响价格升值](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V2Id1WTcP-qQNLkq05UGh.png?height=669&width=1080)\n\n提问：很有趣的是，你可以看到你对即将进入这个领域的开发者有信心。他们要么有加密的背景，要么有游戏的背景。这是值得赌一把的好东西。如果这个领域有什么不确定的地方，这些伟大的团队，经验丰富的人才，似乎值得我们押注。游戏领域的人意识到这是他们想要进入的领域，你是什么时候开始看到这种情况发生的？\n\nSimpson：这波浪潮在2021年真正升温。在此之前，已经有一些来自传统游戏背景的创始人对NFT和web3游戏表示了兴趣。但就真正开始达到临界量而言，是2021年初。我们已经看到它从哪里开始回升。绘制人才迁移的地图是非常令人兴奋的。虽然还不是游戏产业中的所有人，但表示有兴趣或已经积极在游戏中构建Web3组件的创始人的比例显著增加。再次强调，我们认为这是一个值得关注的重要趋势。从那以后，我们一直在投资这些团队。\n\n提问：我认为这将给其他行业带来压力，这很有趣。大公司的首席执行官们面临着压力，他们会说:“不要离开，我们也会探索这个领域。”当我在动视暴雪采访Bobby Kotick时，他表示他们将公司出售给微软的原因之一是他们很难找到人才，留住人才，并为他们承诺制作的游戏雇佣数千名所需人员。有趣的是，这种特殊的区块链游戏趋势可能会卷土重来，并影响主流游戏。\n\nSimpson：是的。我们认为整个游戏理念将对传统游戏实体产生重大影响，无论是发行商还是大型游戏开发商。在这一点上，秘密已经泄露了。我们认为玩家应该抓住他们创造的一些价值。虽然这些模型还需要进行一些迭代，我们还没有达到完美的架构，但核心理念，即创造了这些世界和社区并创造了这么多价值的玩家应该分享这些价值，我们认为这是一个非常重要的理念。\n\n现在，随着玩家越来越熟悉这一事实，这是一种新的模式，我们认为这将给游戏世界中更传统的实体带来巨大的压力，使其采用更有利的模式。它们不会都有相同的模型。这可以有很多形式。但这个核心理念是至关重要的。\n\n提问：我现在感到困惑和疑惑的一个领域是，谁是游戏玩家？在整个2021年，我一直在想区块链游戏将成为元宇宙的垫脚石。你可以将所有这些技术用于资产的身份和互操作性，这些都是创建元宇宙的必要成分。但在12月，我们遇到了玩家反对育碧在《彩虹六号》中的NFT的问题。他们也开始反对其他面向传统玩家的NFT游戏。\n\n那么，谁喜欢NFT，谁讨厌它们呢？亚洲人似乎接受了某些市场的实验，就像他们在免费游戏中所做的一样，而西方的传统玩家和硬核玩家却觉得免费游戏背叛了他们。他们觉得战利品箱就是其中的全部内容。我观察了整个市场，发现免费游戏占据了游戏市场的一半以上。它渗透到游戏的每一个环节，从手机到主机，我们的玩家数量是过去的10倍。对我来说，这些都是好东西。但对于这部分人来说，他们认为免费游戏和区块链游戏是邪恶的东西。\n\n奇怪的是，菲律宾人首先接受了“边玩赚边”的游戏模式。我不知道喜欢这种游戏的玩家和不喜欢这种游戏的玩家谁的占比更高。但我可以看出，如果现在的玩家具有接受它的主流特征，那么NFT游戏成为主流只是时间问题。但如果这些游戏玩家有一些怪癖的话——他们是想通过把钱投入NFT来避税的加密狂人——这里有一些特定的行为是一个小群体的，而不是主流的——也许它永远不会成为主流。如果只是那些在虚拟世界中花1万美元购买一块土地的人，那么这种活动就不会成为主流。\n\n也就是说，你认为现在的受众对这个感兴趣的是什么？什么样的受众可以起飞，并成长为数百万甚至数千万NFT游戏用户？\n\nSimpson： 你提出了一个很好的观点，即**新形式元素**，新模式通常不会被硬核游戏社区所接受。正如你所指出的，这方面有很多先例。但这并没有阻止某些模式获得更大的规模，例如免费游戏。我认为这列火车正驶向车站，它不会真的在这里停下来。\n\n有一群人非常直言不讳地表达了对NFT的保留意见，在很多情况下，他们的批评都是毫无根据的。他们要么没有完全理解这些问题，要么只是用一种非常偏斜的视角来看待问题。但他们只是少数。有很多人已经开始看到这种模式的好处并拥抱它。我不认为这是一个只有非常神秘的原住民的小宇宙。事实上，Axie Infinity是最先成为主流游戏的Web3游戏。它们吸引了数百万玩家。这不仅仅是几个加密货币内部人士。他们拥有巨大的规模，而且他们的大多数玩家都是加密货币的新手。 \n\n这表明，虽然我们还有很大的发展空间，但我们的方向是正确的。游戏是将人们带入这个领域的工具，而不是仅仅吸引一小部分人的自我参照。当然也有讨厌Web3的人，但我认为最重要的是，有数百万人已经表现出对Web3游戏的强烈兴趣。这是我们的重点，也是我们的投资组合公司的重点。\n\n提问：讨论中有趣的部分是，一些游戏开发者继续抵制。他们的论点有时更具技术性。每个人都说这是关于去中心化的，但为什么这里涉及这么多中心化的实体，比如OpenSea？如果OpenSea倒闭，90%的NFT将变得毫无价值。如果你与游戏开发者进行此类讨论，并且需要说服他们，那么这种讨论将如何进行？\n\nSimpson：**我们接触到的大多数创始人都对Web3感到兴奋。**显然，我是加密团队的一员，所以在他们找到我之前，会有一种过滤器。但总的来说，我们已经看到了对这种新模式非常开放的思想和尝试的意愿。游戏是测试新技术和迭代的理想场所，尽管玩家社区的某些子部门可能更不愿意改变。许多之前制作过游戏的Web 2.0创始人都看到了这里的潜力，这也是他们进入这个领域的原因。\n\n我曾与许多在加入web3之前创造过大型游戏的创始人进行过交谈，现在他们会说:“这是最明显的答案。我想不出别的了。这很有意义。这解决了很多问题。”拥有拥有自己的资产的能力—-虽然如果OpenSea消失了，这可能会短暂地影响市场，但事实上我仍然控制着我的剑或我所拥有的任何NFT资产，不管发生什么，因为我拥有链上的钥匙，这是一个重要的转变。许多精明的游戏创始人都明白这一点。这是他们进入这个领域的原因之一。\n\n提问：至于那些可能超出企业家控制范围的事情，比如美国的监管，或允许或不允许的事情，无论是被归类为证券或赌博，还是公司只是不想放弃他们的一些收入流——你认为我们会到达一个比现在更自由的区块链游戏公司的市场吗?\n\nSimpson：当然还有一些监管的灰色地带。在我们的创始人身上，我们看到他们想要合规。他们在寻找可以遵循的明确规则。这就是为什么我们建立了一个庞大的监管团队，与政策制定者合作，帮助他们跟上进度。我们整天都在思考这个领域。他们有许多考虑。只是帮助他们思考这个领域的细微差别。Web3游戏不需要像DeFi协议或其他完全属于这个领域的东西那样的规则。我们要找的是细致入微的监管，做出适当的区分，并适用于他们试图监管的事情。\n\n在我们看来，**监管至关重要。**我们欢迎监管。从消费者保护的角度来看，这是非常重要的。但它需要有意义。这就是为什么我们建立了一个庞大的团队，并花费大量时间在华盛顿特区与监管机构和政策制定者就这些问题进行合作。\n\n提问：我不知道你是否同意这一观点，但我想知道大型游戏公司是否会在这个市场上处于劣势。这与他们的公众地位有关。他们担心规章制度。他们会等待明确的信号，然后才会迅速行动。然而，有些初创公司的价值正在迅速上升，以至于它们将超越大型游戏公司。大型公司通常的解决方案是，谁赢就收购谁。但在手机游戏领域，像Supercell这样的开发商几乎大到无人问津。腾讯几乎是唯一的可能。但手机游戏市场的赢家并不是像Electronic Arts这样的公司。那些能够快速行动且不担心监管的初创公司才是免费游戏的赢家。在我看来，我们现在在区块链游戏中也有同样的机会。\n\nSimpson：肯定是的。正如你所描述的，我们投资了很多这样的初创公司。我们认为他们从第一天起就有能力理解这项技术。它们是加密原生的，web3原生的。他们看到了这个领域可以带来的积极因素。而且，我认为这是一个重要的概念，不仅仅是把一个可能存在于链外的游戏放在一个区块链上。相反，应该利用区块链架构提供的特殊设计约束和机会，作为设计不同玩法形式的新画布。\n\n例如，链上游戏领域是一个非常新的领域，但非常令人兴奋，因为它真的——我的意思是，这是一个游戏世界，你可以在链上战斗，而不仅仅是拥有链上资产。你将区块链整合到游戏玩法中。逻辑是链上的。智能合约是架构的关键部分。所有这些都结合在一起，所以你无法创造出与链下游戏相同的游戏类型。但你可以拥有一种全新的、非常引人注目的体验，它明显是web3原生和加密原生的。我们认为这一类别将推动web3游戏的发展，但我希望我们很快就能看到更多此类内容的出现。\n\n提问：你认为区块链游戏公司的技术储备会变得更简单吗？现在它看起来仍然很复杂。他们有很多选择来选择使用哪条链以及其他东西。你认为这部分会很快变得简单吗？还是说web3将成为一套从根本上更复杂的技术?\n\nSimpson：为了游戏创始人，我希望它能很快变得更简单。你说得对，我们看到想要开发游戏的创始人需要做出很多决定，比如在哪里开发游戏。在某些情况下，这也会影响他们如何设计真正的游戏。例如，Irreverent Labs选择在Solana上进行开发。这伴随着一系列特定的决定。我们也是Mysten Labs的投资者，我认为该公司在游戏和娱乐方面的架构非常出色。它为这种用例设计了一个非常不同的编程模型。\n\n好消息是，创始人拥有越来越多强大的、技术上合理的选择。毫无疑问，我们还有很多工作要做。我们仍然处于基础设施建设阶段。但只要有新的技术领域出现，情况就会是这样。需要构建工具。基础设施的轨道需要变稳固。它需要经过实战检验。在这方面，它正在发生。只是需要一点时间。\n\n提问：通过去中心化，这也有机会改变游戏和大型科技公司之间的关系，这些公司是游戏行业的中间商，他们一直在分一杯羹。这方面的机会有多吸引人?\n\nSimpson：绝对很吸引人。**能够掌控自己的命运是非常重要的，也是非常吸引人的。**\n\n提问：你是否认为除了区块链还有元宇宙都是游戏的赢家，而不是其他类型的群体？无论是大型科技公司、企业还是品牌。\n\nSimpson：我觉得你提到的这些类别有很多重叠的地方。它们并不完全相同，但在边缘有重叠。我们认为一些相同的重要支柱是这些概念的核心。我们最近发表了一篇关于我们认为是元宇宙的七个基本要素的文章。像开放和去中心化这样的事情对我们认为的元宇宙的最终状态很重要。显然，有些人试图推出封闭的元宇宙，但我们认为机会在于开放的元宇宙。\n\n同样地，人们也在以更传统的形式发行封闭生态系统的游戏。我们在Web3游戏中看到了机会，它是开放的，并给予玩游戏的社区更多所有权。肯定有一些相似之处，也有一些重叠之处。在某些情况下，你会看到游戏生活在元宇宙中。界限有点模糊了。但现在它们都是实验性的，非常令人兴奋的领域，它们正在推动前沿。\n\n我认为web3组件在元宇宙和web3游戏中都是重要的元素。我的意思是，代币作为所有权的一部分，持久的数字身份，去中心化，所有这些对Web3来说非常重要的概念。这些元素在元宇宙和游戏环境中都是不可或缺的。这就是一些相似和重叠的地方。\n\n提问：如果存在Web3的支持者和反对者之间的战争，那么决定性的因素可能是我们拥有多少优秀的游戏开发者加入并取得巨大成功的例子。我想到了像Mythical 或Forte这样的公司。Paul Bettner的公司，Wildcard Alliance。他们都非常专注于制作具有NFT功能的硬核游戏。但我也会回想起免费游戏的赢家，并不是把《侠盗猎车手》放到手机平台上。而是Supercell。对比一下Axie Infinity的开发者和制作硬核游戏并将其引进的开发者，你认为谁最值得关注?\n\nSimpson： 我们既投资了web3原生平台，也投资了新进入游戏领域的创始人，以及在传统游戏领域拥有悠久历史的创始人。我觉得这不是一个人对另一个人的问题。**我们寻找的是那些能够理解如何创造出一款优秀游戏，并且能够理解Web3技术并能够看到机遇和限制的人。**这就得到了我之前描述的东西。这是一个不同的设计空间。这意味着，在某些方面，它可以更好，而在其他方面，它可以更具挑战性。我们没有优先考虑一种类型的创始人或一种模式。相反地，我们正在寻找创造出优秀游戏的关键见解，并支持那些我们认为能够创造出优秀游戏体验的顶级团队。\n\n提问：你们是否在公司的不同部门都有专业知识，或者你们都变得更加多学科，学习一些关于元宇宙、加密货币和区块链的知识?\n\nSimpson：我们都是加密和web3的通才，尽管我们中的一些人倾向于专注于某些领域。我更关注于应用层，消费者元宇宙，Web3，游戏等等。如果有一项投资与此相关——例如，Mysten Labs，一个拥有大量主要面向应用层游戏技术的出色团队，以及其他我花了大量时间研究的公司——在这种情况下，它可能是基础设施投资，但它仍然支持这个类别。\n\n提问：我想很多人会希望我问你，我们什么时候才能摆脱这个加密货币的冬天，但我不知道这对你的计划是否重要。\n\nSimpson：**我们需要从长远的角度来看待这个市场。**在这个领域待了一段时间后，我们看到了周期的来来去去。在现实中，它们很难预测。我的工作是寻找伟大的技术专家，帮助他们建立自己的业务，而不是做短期预测。不幸的是，我在这方面帮不上什么忙。但好消息是，我们最近公布了45亿美元的基金。这说明了我们在这里看到的机会的规模，以及我们对这一领域的未来感到非常兴奋的事实。\n\n提问：你今天还有什么想评论的吗?\n\nSimpson：我们认为web3游戏是最令人兴奋的领域之一。看到游戏把人类带进Web领域真的太神奇了。我曾与许多人交谈，他们说:“哦，我最初接触加密货币是因为我开始玩Axie Infinity。”这是让人们了解这项技术及其功能的重要方式。我很期待看到这个领域的其他成就。\n\n \n

{"id": "VuQfMcffvYM-vgXjNgcgA9qucNFDCaL4QGGcri_xZNw", "title": "比特币怎么买卖-买比特币违法么", "body": "比特币可以说是世界上第一个基于区块链技术创建的去中心化的加密货币，比特币是在2008年由中本聪发明的，距今已经有11年的时间了，近些年来，比特币的出圈让越来越多的人们开始了解到了加密数字货币的市场，而比特币也成为了这一市场中当之无愧的龙头。相信现在很多投资者手中都持有比特币，不过对于一些币圈新手来说，他们想要投资比特币，但是还不知道现在比特币怎么买？接下来就让币圈子小编为大家带来BTC比特币买入和交易教程图解。\n\n## BTC比特币买入和交易教程图解\n\n1\\.打开币安交易所官网，您可以直接点击下方链接进入（注意要先开vpn注意避开美国地区的）\n\n[https://accounts.binance.com/zh-TW/register?ref=RXKE7LXW](https://accounts.binance.com/zh-TW/register?ref=RXKE7LXW)\n\n官网，根据下方提示依次选择【使用手机号或邮箱注册】--【台湾】--【邮箱】(推荐QQ、网易163、搜狐邮箱)填写邮箱、密码，点击【注册】\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LFZHPq9GBixMq-xY6b54D.png?height=1094&width=1348)\n\n2\\.注册之后需要进行身份验证，您可以通过【用户中心】-【身份认证】进行身份认证，在该页面可以查看当前认证级别，它决定了您的账户在币安的交易限额。如需提升额度，请依次完成各个级别的身份认证。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vbr7j5lrgVCzVPwpn6gOj.png?height=547&width=2048)\n\n3\\.完成身份验证之后，在首页点击【一键买币】进入交易页面\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FtUZ4YmY2PsiK64uMS1iK.png?height=685&width=1548)\n\n4\\.然后选择【自选区】，根据需求选择合适的商家，点击【购买USDT】。根据弹窗提示向卖家付款，点击“我已付款”等待卖家放币即可。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/idyp0VGh9CH6A6iGRG8r6.png?height=787&width=1534)\n\n5\\.点击行情进入币种页面，搜索比特币英文简称BTC。\n\n6\\.点击BTC/USDT交易对，进入购买页面\n\n7\\.填写购买数量，点击买入，若是卖出，填写卖出数量，点击卖出即可。\n\n## 比特币前景如何？\n\n投资者问比特币今后走势到底会怎么样？首先我们一定要认清这个市场的投资者构成。目前这个市场投资者主要是大资本的市场，就是像马斯克这类世界富豪，大资本进入到了加密数字货币市场。在这样一个情况下，比特币价格今后它跌也不会跌到哪里去，如果比特币暴跌，大资本就会被套牢，他们一定会靠资本实力左右市场走势，但大涨也有局限性。\n\n因为现在全球央行包括监管部门对比特币越来越趋向于加强监管，防止比特币过度投机炒作，特别是防止比特币逃避各个国家的外汇管制，进行洗钱，跨境转移资产，把钱洗白，防止比特币充当这种手段，所以说在这种情况下，大资本不断进入要托盘；监管部门不断给比特币泼冷水让他冷静下来，比特币价格可能会大跌，大跌以后可能会报复性反弹；报复性反弹，又遇到监管强力监管，又会大跌，又会报复性反弹。\n\n一般投资者能不能投资比特币？我是坚决反对，特别在中国。如果央行把出入金这个渠道卡死，包括你线下交易卡死的话，首先，你在监管政策过程就面临着很大的一个风险。我不知道现在已经在线下交易这一块，我们叫线下市场这一块，出入金现在是否正常？你以前进到这个账户里的资金，现在取出来会是个怎么样？持有比特币的，想把它卖掉变现能不能变现，现在都有疑问。这一块风险比较大，所以中国现在基本上对比特币在监管上会越来越趋紧。\n\n投资者在中国投资比特币，首先考虑到是否违法违规，第二个就是我说的这个监管政策，这种风险一定要考虑。\n\n本质上来说，比特币不是这种工薪阶层，这种小资本投资的市场，在那里一夜暴富觉得很难，因为他是大资本的市场，目前这种行情基本上就是可以说是大资本在左右着。这样的话，小资本进去以后，成为虾米被大鱼大资本吃掉可能性很大。这里提醒投资者一定要注意。\n\n另外一个就是我们说加密数字货币，她是完全以区块链为技术，是个去中心化分布式账本和全员信用背书的，它的生命力就在这个地方。所以中本聪设计之初，比特币实质上是为了防止主权货币过度贬值，无形中掠过老百姓的财富，实质上它是冲着国际货币-美元去的。如果沿着这个目标走下去，我觉得比特币的前景还是有的，并且前景还非常广大。一时半会儿这种加密货币市场还消失不了。我们知道有个大空头叫达里奥，他是桥水基金的一个创始人，董事长，他以前竭力反对比特币，而现在也开始力挺比特币，也准备投资比特币，这个转变当然对投资者应该会有一个启发。", "timestamp": 1658146691, "digest": "T0XBxa23SGpScGCSlJBGi7Nj6kJ2vauL5TUlxyLOaaA", "contributor": "0xeE0974e1f9C1826c4B9389b4f532c1de5bb9F41E"}

{"id": "e_JMj-dw6r2ik3ChzPbBlv3jS9gWmoAdZl4oV6A_V5E", "title": "Test Dao Quick Tips: How to Not Fail at Gnosis-Safe", "body": "### You ever wonder “sweet,  I’m a multi-sig signer”  life is going to be great!  Right??\n\nLife is indeed great as a multi sig signer, (or a multi signatory for the cultured of us).  You get to have a say in what compensation gets to be approved, and sometimes, you get airdrops! We love airdrops!  You can feel that special twinkle of joy in your spirit when you’re voted in as a multi sig, or chosen, or volunteered.\n\nOf course, being a multi signatory comes with its own pains, struggles, and annoyances.  I’ve gathered a few tips based on my own failures as a multi signatory, and maybe, this might help you make your life the sweet joy of multi-signerness that have come to expect.  Lets begin.\n\n### 1. Pay attention to your notifications!\n\nDiscord notifications are awful.  We know they’re awful, and if you’re like me, you’re more than likely to miss 75% of them because you’ve opted to a good nights sleep instead of productivity.  (A good nights sleep is productive, don’t let any crypto bro tell you otherwise).\n\nSometimes, you’re going to see notifications that are something along the lines of “hey fren,  confirm your transaction please!”  \n\nI have come to find out (and yes i probably should have known) that gas fees can make or break a transaction.  Gas fees can also change at any given moment in time.  A delayed transaction (as I’ve suffered plenty of times over the last month)  will cause more problems than they’re worth.  \n\nI’ve suffered quite a few rejections of transactions due to the gas limits changing and getting out of whack after starting a transaction.   Having singers pay attention to their notifications, and signing if they are free, almost always can solve issues leading to transactions needing to be rejected. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A10afCdxWp8xk2vRht_Fa.png?height=328&width=1326)\n\n### 2. Explore the types of apps that could work with Gnosis.\n\nThere are more apps available than [Parcel](https://parcel.money/).  Most people assume that Gnosis only works for paying out contributors during remuneration time, and for not much else.\n\nThe types of apps that work for gnosis are interesting.  From apps that can drain your wallet, to apps that can set up recurring payments for contributors,  there are more options to explore when it comes to Gnosis-Safe compatible apps. There are even apps that can help you with swapping tokens around.\n\nAs long as you keep tip #1 in mind, its important to check out the different types of apps that are available that have Gnosis-Safe compatibility.  Try some swaps (with guidance from your fellow contributors of course) try some invoicing apps, and more.  If you do not see an app that is readily available, use the wallet connect app.\n\nMost importantly,  realize there’s more to the Gnosis-Safe than remuneration occurring monthly. It’s almost exciting to investigate.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LEUpyAJ_L-eJ31NKjXbCp.png?height=594&width=1105)\n\n### 3. Don’t be afraid to bug people to respond to their transactions.  Whether they need to be confirmed or rejected.\n\nBe strong, young grasshopper,  if you need to get the transaction completed, then you need to get the transaction completed.   Reach out to your fellow multi sig signers to get things moving along. \n\nHopefully platforms such as [Den](http://onchainden.com), and others, can help with notifications to take the work off of my back with bothering people.  There can be more time spent testing projects, right? \n\n### 4. Having trouble completing a confirmation via the mobile app?  Before giving up, try completing on the computer instead.\n\nHaving gnosis-safe available on mobile (excuse me, on iPhone) is a convenience, but not always functionable. If you run into an issue with using gnosis on your phone, try using your computer before giving up.  Sometimes, the simple answer, is the best one.\n\n### 5. Name your owners, and name your multi sigs!\n\nFor Test DAO, I somehow inadvertently added a mysterious unknown wallet address to the multi sig.  For days, I couldn’t figure out who this person was.   Clearly an unsafe move, it would have been a better move to figure out the names of who happens to be on the multi sig before I started completing transactions.  \n\nYou can do the same when importing your safe.  Unless you have an ability to memorize numbers (and some people do), its always a pain when you come across multiple safes and you have no idea which safe belongs where?\n\nYour life can be made so much easier by simply naming your safe.  We all need things to be as simple as possible when dealing with paying people, right?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QpR5GO5mok0MwFXcZBKdk.png?height=491&width=410)\n\n### Conclusion - there are always more tips to add, so let me know what you have for us here!\n\nThis is not a definitive list of gnosis tips. Whatever tips you have for gnosis management will be more than welcome to have a place on this list.  Please let us know if you have any more tips!  The story doesn’t end here, its only just begun!\n\nReach out to me on twitter - http://twitter.com/infinitehomie\n\nOr find us in discord: http://discord.gg/thetestdao", "timestamp": 1658148242, "digest": "GR6xgPIKEEwSEm1JOxbRTPpLecIur2SmH0xgWd92Rlk", "contributor": "0x96AC4a8925288b224972A007Ca91C99b46a02d1D"}

Mainly because so many of the jokes in *Robin Hood: Men in Tights* are predicated on anachronisms. But also because an awareness of them can help prevent misunderstandings when they are used. As technology advances, anachronisms are inevitable as we attempt to fold new developments into our everyday language. The classic example is referring to a car as a “horse-less carriage”.\n\nWhen the term wallet is used in the crypto space, it is used anachronistically. The term gets the job done, but often leads to confusion about what exactly a wallet is or does. You may hear of web3 wallets, crypto wallets, bitcoin wallets, or ethereum wallets. When I was coming up, all the cool kids had a Fossil wallet, the long checkbook kind. I am writing an article on web3 and cryptocurrency, so clearly I did not have this kind of wallet. I’m pretty sure mine was Dockers brand. Definitely a trifold.\n\nSo what is this new kind of wallet exactly? A web3 wallet is software that allows you to interact with a blockchain. Remember, the blockchain maintains records. In a typical cryptocurrency setting, these records are records of transactions. A wallet allows you to initiate new transactions or new records on the blockchain. Of course these must be confirmed and validated by the network.\n\n### What’s in Your Wallet?\n\nWeb3 wallets do not hold or contain any cryptocurrency in the way that a traditional wallet would hold dollar bills. This is the main anachronistic misunderstanding that needs to be avoided. What they contain is the software necessary to interact with a blockchain network. They also contain two cryptographic keys. These keys are referred to as a Public Key and a Private key. These two keys are the most important thing contained in a wallet.\n\nThese two keys are the basis of the cryptography that secures the blockchain. The typical analogy used to describe them is a padlock and key. The public key works like an open padlock that you can give to anyone. You keep the private key, which opens the padlock. When they want to send you something, they secure it with the padlock. Once the padlock is secured the only way to open it is by using the Private key, which only you should have.\n\nBoth of these keys are very long and complicated alpha-numeric codes. For example, the public key for my Ethereum wallet is:\n\n*0x14237e3a87BDa9FC4aD65ED2a2c9d43F535f73CF*\n\nThis code represents me on the ethereum blockchain. This is my address or identity. This key is public, so it is safe for anyone to have it. If someone wants to send me something, such as cryptocurrency or an NFT, they would send it to this address. “Sending it” would mean they use their wallet to create a transaction that assigns or records ownership of the item to my address. Now it is under my control. It has been locked with my public key. I can leave it locked or I can unlock it and send it to someone else. In order to unlock it, I would need the other thing inside my wallet - my private key. Private keys must be kept secure. Private keys are used to unlock the cryptocurrency, NFT, or other item and send it to a new address. The person who has the private key is the person who has control over the items associated with the paired public key. If your private key is lost, your ability to access and control any assets associated with your public key address is lost as well. Wallets help you keep up with these keys.\n\nWithin a wallet, you can create and manage multiple Public key / Private key pairs which operate like different accounts.\n\n### Getting a Wallet and Some $Crypto\n\nThe first thing a person has to do to interact with the web3 world is to get a wallet. There are lots of options. Some wallets are designed to work with a single blockchain only, such as a bitcoin wallet. Other wallets, called multi-chain wallets, can interact with multiple blockchains and allow you to manage different types of cryptocurrencies through the same wallet interface. Once someone has a wallet, they can connect to an online exchange to trade their American dollars for cryptocurrency or an NFT. (I know I keep mentioning NFTs without explaining what that is. That will be the next article.) The exchange will then create a new transaction that assigns the agreed upon amount of cryptocurrency to the pubic key address of the wallet. It is now locked with that Public key. Once the transaction is added to the blockchain record, the person “owns” or is in control of that cryptocurrency because they are the only ones who have the Private key to unlock it.\n\nRemember, when this cryptocurrency is “sent” to the new user, nothing is actually sent. This is often a hard concept for people to get their minds around, but an incredibly important one to understand. Instead, the record on the blockchain is updated to show that their address now controls the cryptocurrency they purchased. In this way, they own it. The cryptocurrency is not in their wallet, but rather their wallet contains the Private key that allows them to control the cryptocurrency.\n\n## Types of Wallets\n\nThere are some important distinctions among the types of wallets out there. These distinctions are typically based on a trade off between ease of use and security.\n\n### Hardware wallets are for Hardcore People\n\nThe first type of wallet to consider is a hardware wallet. This is the most secure type of wallet. These typically look like a USB thumb drive. The reason they are so secure is because they can be unplugged from your computer and buried in a coffee can in your yard. Without that device and the Private key it contains, no one is gaining access to your cryptocurrency. The downside is, if you forget where you buried the coffee can you aren’t gaining access to your cryptocurrency either. These are also going to be password protected, so if you lose your password you won’t be able to get into the device to access any cryptocurrency associated with that wallet. There is also the possibility that the device itself could break, leaving you in the lurch without a way to access your cryptocurrency.\n\nWhen you use a hardware wallet, you and you alone are in control of your Private key. Therefore, you and you alone are in control of your cryptocurrency. If something happens to your hardware wallet, there is no tech support to email or call to help you get it back.\n\n### Custodial vs Non-Custodial\n\nMost people are going to use a software based wallet that is accessed through a computer, web browser, or smartphone app. The major distinction between these types of wallets is Custodial vs Non-Custodial.\n\nA Custodial wallet is a wallet that you access through a third party or custodian. These types of wallets are the most user friendly in the sense that if you have any issues or forget your password, there is normally tech support options and the usual password recovery options. The reason they are able to offer so much help is because they hold both the Public and Private key. This is helpful when it comes to ease of use, but it presents a major risk when it comes to security. The reason it presents such a security risk is because you are not actually in control. Instead, you are trusting a third party, which is really antithetical to the entire web3 ideal.\n\nOne of the biggest risks associated with Custodial wallets is for the custodian to go out of business. If you use a Custodial wallet through a company that goes out of business, you will most likely loose access to your wallet and the keys it contains. Without that private key, you cannot control any of what you own. This was a very common issue in the early days of cryptocurrency when companies would pop up and then fail quickly. In fact, there is quite a bit of cryptocurrency sitting on the blockchain, never to be accessed again because someone lost their access to their Private keys when a company went dark.\n\nAnother risk to Custodial wallets is the potential for censorship. If the third party custodian decides for some reason, political or otherwise, that you should not have access to your cryptocurrency, then they can cut you off by removing your access to the Private key controlling your cryptocurrency. \n\nArguably the best happy medium between a hardware wallet and a Custodial wallet is a Non-Custodial wallet. These are sometimes referred to as Self-Custody wallets. These are wallets that only you control, so there is no third party who has access to your keys. These wallets live on your device. These can be desktop applications, web browser extensions, or smartphone apps. The main security risk is that the device they live on will typically be connected to the internet and therefore have the potential to be hacked. Also, the device could be stolen. These wallets are password protected. If you lose your password, there are some limited options for recovering the password. Typically password recovery is through a “seed phrase” which is a long collection of random words that essentially function as a very secure backup password. If you lose your password and your seed phrase, you are toast. It will be very difficult to recover access to your wallet and the Private key it contains.\n\n## That Thing They Keep Saying\n\nIf you wander around the crypto world for very long, you are sure to run into someone saying, “Not your keys, not your coins”. This is a good summary of how to understand wallets and control of cryptocurrency. Wallets contain keys. These keys are used to control the cryptocurrency associated with them. If you don’t have access to the keys because you lost access to your wallet, then you can’t control your coins.\n\nAnother thing people will say is, “I have some bitcoin in my wallet”. This is simply not true. This is an anachronistic understanding of what crypto wallets do. Even when people say they “own” cryptocurrency, this isn’t exactly the case. What they own, or what they are in possession of, is the Private key that allows them to control the coins associated with a particular Public key. This control plays out on the blockchain record where the software contained in a wallet allows the person to create a new record that shows the cryptocurrency is now assigned to a different Public key, which represents the address or identity of a different person. This new person will be the new owner, so long as they have their Private key.\n\n## End Note\n\nSince the last article I published, cryptocurrency prices have tanked. Some people are crying because they lost a bunch of money. Other people are patting themselves on the back for being so shrewd and knowing better than to invest in something as silly as computer money.\n\nNo one should be surprised. It was a bubble and the bubble popped. Many people have been forecasting a so-called Crypto Winter for awhile. Is this it? Maybe. Could things go lower? Maybe.\n\nThis isn’t all bad. (Easy for me to say, I didn’t just lose my shirt.) This will be a chance for web3 applications that are actually good, useful, and solve problems to rise to the top, while less valuable ideas and scams will get left behind. Projects that are inherently valuable will hang around and get better.\n\nI’ll keep writing; you keep reading. If and when you decide to join the web3 world, it won’t be because of hype, but rather because you understand what you are getting into and you see the real value in it.", "timestamp": 1658148862, "digest": "BeYtuWB2KHVJGRFK9XPUHjqA9yXpnad77Mxzw_OMfRk", "contributor": "0x14237e3a87BDa9FC4aD65ED2a2c9d43F535f73CF"}

In a broader sense, *Crisis* is an ongoing multi-media, multi-level experiment that explores alternative ideas for the distribution and exploitation of musical works. It is the journey of an album that defied the dominant structures of its system in order to break new ground.\n\nThis project aims to align *releases* ↔︎ *value* ↔︎ *community* into one common narrative. Read more about the process below.\n\n## Season 00 – The Story\n\nOne year ago the journey of Crisis began with the release of *[Crisis (The Worthless Album)](https://open.spotify.com/album/7nwbv2tj8q9OTWhin3ZBsm).* What had been planned as a traditional release, changed due to a pivotal decision.\n\nThe album was cut into 30 pieces, each 29 seconds long. Since a stream only starts counting after 30 seconds of playtime, it can't collect plays or earn any revenue, no matter how much it's listened to. The value of this album is 0.000$\n\nUltimately, this is the only way to choose one's own value in the current system of being patronised by a pro-rata system (streaming) of big tech and major labels. By releasing an album this way, it reveals quite the imbalance and absurdity of the music industry's current monetisation model and asks if centralised platforms should define the value of art according to a demand-supply calculation. Or, instead, shall creators regain complete control over the value they create.\n\n> \"*Valentin Hansen released an album in a way that’s never been done before. In doing so, he highlighted the unprecedented shift in how music is being made as a direct result of the rule.*\"\n> — Brian Harrington, [The Album That's Worth Nothing](https://deathbyalgorithm.substack.com/p/the-album-thats-worth-nothing)\n\nNo matter how many of the industry tricks we utilised, we ended up in a zero-sum game.\n\n![An exhibition with a click farm.

To put it more simply, we will distribute ownership of *Crisis* during 9+ seasons.\n\nTherefore, the original album was minted as one piece of music on [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/valentinhansen/crisis-the-album-).\n\nOwnership of this NFT will be represented by each season's tokens (editions of NFTs), with 50% of the shares being transferred within the first nine seasons. Additionally, each season represents the album in its current form. As seasonal NFTs are collected, the album starts to change visually, sonically, & experientially until that particular season sells out.\n\nUpon sellout, a new season unlocks, shape- shifting the album once more and unlocking further experiences, products, visuals, etc.\n\nThe remaining 50% will be allocated in season 10. This way—when the album becomes the most expensive work of music ever sold—it'll be fully owned by the community that helped it reach this status.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iIhgeVic-qPXG15O8qcM5.jpg?height=2589&width=2767)\n\nThe journey will continue as long as people keep unlocking the next chapter.
