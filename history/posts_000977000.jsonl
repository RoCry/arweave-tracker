Even though some are down 80% from their all-time highs, the rally is a breather for bulls. Bitcoin pumped to 21k and then to 22k, with low volumes. But what about whales? Are they selling this rally? Can the pump last for long, given the worsening macroeconomic conditions? Let's find out!**\n\n**TLDR** \n\n* Miners Capitulating\n* Consequences of A Capitulation Event\n* Interesting Onchain Activity in Ethereum \n* Binance Whales and Their Masterplan\n\n## Miners Capitulating\n\nIt is no big secret that miners control most of the active bitcoin liquidity. Yes, whales are influential players, but many miners, over time, become whales. And when the miners sell their bitcoin reserves, it points to an eventual bottom of the market. Of course, when miners sell, it leads to short-term dips too. But for long-term enthusiasts of bitcoin, capitulation is a solid buy signal.\n\n**So, what exactly is Miners' reserve?** It is the amount of Bitcoin held by miners. At the same time, it is worth noting that the value accounts for affiliate miners only. That means the reserve excludes old miners who don't have any mining activity now.\n\n### What Is The Status Of Capitulation?\n\nSince 2021, miners have been consistently accumulating bitcoin. It also means that the miners have not realized any significant profit in the last 18 months!\n\n![Capitulation](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yOppEJpWc3CRZ2Em3ytI-.png?height=2700&width=4287)\n\nBut now, miners are forced to sell their biggest bag since 2021.\nSome major reasons are;\n\n1. Increasing mining costs\n2. Decreased price of bitcoin\n\nMany miners are left with no option other than to sell some of their reserves.\n\n### What Are The Consequences?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the most critical consequence is a short-term price fall. There is too much selling pressure from miners and minimal buying pressure from investors. There is a supply-demand mismatch, and the market might settle for a lower bitcoin price.\n\n## Interesting Onchain Activity In Ethereum\n\nEthereum had a great turn of events, especially after [announcing the merge date](https://twitter.com/WeekInEthNews/status/1548101125101867009). It was crucial for the entire altcoin market (most pumped 10-30%). But Ethereum is still trading below its 2018 all-time high.\n\nTwo Transactions caught my attention today.\n\n<https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe150141e9d9e0af32796416d2be37ac7addecd1250117e51a2a5062703752fef>\n\n```\nToday, on 18th July, 20.4K ETH was transferred to the FTX exchange. \n```\n\nThe wallet holds almost $250K worth of assets now, and its primary and secondary wallets hold $48 million and $31 million in assets respectively. Most importantly, the wallets are stable coin dominated and are 2-3 years old.\n\n![source : Etherscan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V6DAyB0uMvJcpCyCqT4hp.png?height=391&width=943)\n\nThis tells us that, at least some of the whales do not believe the bear market is over.\n\n<https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7b760bb4ca67c2492e0453b30c8918eb530bd473defd2a94fe40d4fd1ab98026>\n\n![source : Etherscan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Et21v-JRCKfZj6NalxkXZ.png?height=391&width=943)\n\nLike the first wallet, this one is also a whale wallet that holds 84.5K ETH and $587 million worth of assets.\n\nThis whale is also panicking, trying to sell all his altcoins.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UpGG38Ma4SsDAxqVFd7bw.png?height=933&width=1363)\n\nThe above two examples tell us three things particularly;\n\n1. Whales are not happy with the market. They will possibly dump on relief rallies. \n2. It is better to take profits when the market is green. \n3. We might experience a long bear market this time.\n\n## Masterplan Of Binance Whales\n\nBinance is the biggest centralized crypto exchange with the most volume and liquidity. These factors make Binance a whale destination. But has the inflows to Binance affected bitcoin?\n\nLet’s see how bitcoin price action is correlated with the exchange inflow into Binance.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cl4MS45nRTUHRCELJcPJ1.png?height=2700&width=4287)\n\nIn mid-march 2022, the exchange inflow to Binance was at moderate levels.\nBitcoin was ranging between 38k and 47k at that time.\n\nBut as soon as the price crashed to 32k in the first week of May, whales started sending their bitcoin holdings to exchanges to sell in profit.\n\nBut the bitcoin price was relatively stable for the next two weeks. Probably whales were looking for exit liquidity, and did not want the price to dip further.\n\nWhales succeeded and were able to sell their BTC at 32k- 30k level, which precipitated another fall to 20k in June 2022.\n\nSince then, BTC has been trading in the 19k - 21k price range. However, on 17th July, inflows broke the moderate levels again!\n\nAre Binance whales planning another dump? Only time will tell. However, analyzing past behaviors, they are likely to grab exit liquidity from the shorts liquidation, etc.", "timestamp": 1658143811, "digest": "wXREIsAt61oxzroZhN_RwURjiudBo_MyRbg5V62UnjI", "contributor": "0x184254ca63135943e5b33a06c65f01E3c91C0E9F"}
