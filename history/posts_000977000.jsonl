Let's find out!**\n\n**TLDR** \n\n* Miners Capitulating\n* Consequences of A Capitulation Event\n* Interesting Onchain Activity in Ethereum \n* Binance Whales and Their Masterplan\n\n## Miners Capitulating\n\nIt is no big secret that miners control most of the active bitcoin liquidity. Yes, whales are influential players, but many miners, over time, become whales. And when the miners sell their bitcoin reserves, it points to an eventual bottom of the market. Of course, when miners sell, it leads to short-term dips too. But for long-term enthusiasts of bitcoin, capitulation is a solid buy signal.\n\n**So, what exactly is Miners' reserve?** It is the amount of Bitcoin held by miners. At the same time, it is worth noting that the value accounts for affiliate miners only. That means the reserve excludes old miners who don't have any mining activity now.\n\n### What Is The Status Of Capitulation?\n\nSince 2021, miners have been consistently accumulating bitcoin. It also means that the miners have not realized any significant profit in the last 18 months!\n\n![Capitulation](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yOppEJpWc3CRZ2Em3ytI-.png?height=2700&width=4287)\n\nBut now, miners are forced to sell their biggest bag since 2021.\nSome major reasons are;\n\n1. Increasing mining costs\n2. Decreased price of bitcoin\n\nMany miners are left with no option other than to sell some of their reserves.\n\n### What Are The Consequences?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the most critical consequence is a short-term price fall. There is too much selling pressure from miners and minimal buying pressure from investors. There is a supply-demand mismatch, and the market might settle for a lower bitcoin price.\n\n## Interesting Onchain Activity In Ethereum\n\nEthereum had a great turn of events, especially after [announcing the merge date](https://twitter.com/WeekInEthNews/status/1548101125101867009). It was crucial for the entire altcoin market (most pumped 10-30%). But Ethereum is still trading below its 2018 all-time high.\n\nTwo Transactions caught my attention today.\n\n<https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe150141e9d9e0af32796416d2be37ac7addecd1250117e51a2a5062703752fef>\n\n```\nToday, on 18th July, 20.4K ETH was transferred to the FTX exchange. \n```\n\nThe wallet holds almost $250K worth of assets now, and its primary and secondary wallets hold $48 million and $31 million in assets respectively. Most importantly, the wallets are stable coin dominated and are 2-3 years old.\n\n![source : Etherscan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V6DAyB0uMvJcpCyCqT4hp.png?height=391&width=943)\n\nThis tells us that, at least some of the whales do not believe the bear market is over.\n\n<https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7b760bb4ca67c2492e0453b30c8918eb530bd473defd2a94fe40d4fd1ab98026>\n\n![source : Etherscan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Et21v-JRCKfZj6NalxkXZ.png?height=391&width=943)\n\nLike the first wallet, this one is also a whale wallet that holds 84.5K ETH and $587 million worth of assets.\n\nThis whale is also panicking, trying to sell all his altcoins.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UpGG38Ma4SsDAxqVFd7bw.png?height=933&width=1363)\n\nThe above two examples tell us three things particularly;\n\n1. Whales are not happy with the market. They will possibly dump on relief rallies. \n2. It is better to take profits when the market is green. \n3. We might experience a long bear market this time.\n\n## Masterplan Of Binance Whales\n\nBinance is the biggest centralized crypto exchange with the most volume and liquidity. These factors make Binance a whale destination. But has the inflows to Binance affected bitcoin?\n\nLet’s see how bitcoin price action is correlated with the exchange inflow into Binance.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cl4MS45nRTUHRCELJcPJ1.png?height=2700&width=4287)\n\nIn mid-march 2022, the exchange inflow to Binance was at moderate levels.\nBitcoin was ranging between 38k and 47k at that time.\n\nBut as soon as the price crashed to 32k in the first week of May, whales started sending their bitcoin holdings to exchanges to sell in profit.\n\nBut the bitcoin price was relatively stable for the next two weeks. Probably whales were looking for exit liquidity, and did not want the price to dip further.\n\nWhales succeeded and were able to sell their BTC at 32k- 30k level, which precipitated another fall to 20k in June 2022.\n\nSince then, BTC has been trading in the 19k - 21k price range. However, on 17th July, inflows broke the moderate levels again!\n\nAre Binance whales planning another dump? Only time will tell.

Join us as we look back on a great fireside chat that spanned a range of topics, from Evgeny’s experience using PWN to the best security practices in DeFi and the future of NFTs.\n\n### Introduction\n\nSteve and [Evgeny](https://twitter.com/evgeny_re7) first met about a year ago, when Evgeny reached out to Steve after both took part in a call together with some folks from [MetaCartel](https://twitter.com/Meta_Cartel). They’ve stayed in touch since then, and just recently, our team has been in touch with Evgeny about a [super exciting Nouns NFT loan](https://twitter.com/pwndao/status/1547854897478963200?s=20&t=Av67GzoUdR5v21bQt1x1Sg) worth $60K that’s currently backed on the PWN platform. Through this process, Evgeny had a chance to get up and personal with our platform.\n\n### What does Re7 Capital think of the PWN platform?\n\nEvgeny was one of the first people to use the recently released version of the [PWN protocol and platform](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/). So what was his experience like while using it?\n\n* **Great UX and UI**: Evgeny mentioned that using PWN is smooth and the process is super straightforward. He’s a fan of our clean UI (and enjoys our simple yet aesthetically pleasing color palette)! \n \n* **Verification made easy**: Using PWN, it’s easy to cross-check assets on OpenSea. This is because we include an asset explorer link (such as Opensea) directly on a loan’s detail page. [Visit PWN](https://pwn.xyz/) to learn more.\n\n### All about the Nouns deal\n\n[Our first Nouns NFT loan](https://twitter.com/pwndao/status/1547854897478963200?s=20&t=Av67GzoUdR5v21bQt1x1Sg) is a big deal. \n\nWe’re extra excited about it, since there are only 374 Nouns in existence with a floor price of 108 ETH (roughly $115,560) per NFT. Around 10,000 Nouns are estimated to be around in the late 2040s, so there’s currently less potential sell pressure and buyers are closely involved through proposals and the nounification of the NFT landscape.\n\nThe Nouns community is one of the most active communities out there, and they actively manage their treasury. What makes this community really stand out is how well-structured it is as well as the fact that the team is composed of real DeFi professionals.\n\nNouns’ average price has been going up over the last \\~120 days, with an average 90-day price of 96 ETH and a 90-day volume of 2,807 ETH. Nouns DAO has implemented some best practices of other blue-chip PFP projects – they’re CC0 and they have been innovating with funding mechanisms. \n\nWhen using the platform, PWN users don’t need to worry about owning an NFT worth 100 ETH. Since PWN is deployed on Polygon, network fees won’t be a problem for NFTs with a smaller value. [Check out the PWN platform for yourself](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/)!\n\n### Steve’s questions for Re7\n\nA large segment of our fireside chat with [Re7](https://twitter.com/Re7Capital) was spent discussing some hot topics in a Q&A session. We’ll sum up some of the questions that Steve had for Evgeny.\n\n**How do you check that you’re interacting with the right contract?**\n\nRe7 carries out dozens of on-chain transactions every day and has been doing so for a year. In the team’s day-to-day activities, maintaining security is a top priority. ”It’s really easy to lose money on the blockchain if you’re not careful”, said Evgeny. “It’s really important to double check everything you’re doing.”\n\nEvgeny emphasized the ongoing need to keep one’s security in check while mentioning a few notable industry vulnerabilities, such as the exploits affecting [Convex](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/24/convex-finance-sets-up-new-urls-after-website-address-is-hijacked/), [Harmony](https://decrypt.co/104138/north-korean-attackers-behind-100m-harmony-hack-report), and [Solana’s Wormhole](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/03/solanas-sol-tumbles-10-after-326m-wormhole-exploit/).\n\nA couple pieces of advice to stay on top of one’s security are as follows: Always be sure to [verify contract addresses on Etherscan](https://info.etherscan.com/how-to-verify-address-ownership/#:\\~:text=Step%201%3A%20Upon%20clicking%20on,able%20to%20sign%20the%20message.) and check that any collateral is really what you think it is. \n\n**Do you proactively revoke approvals that you think you won’t be using in the future?**\n\nThe Re7 team finds it the most efficient to carry out periodic reviews. “The reality is that if you’re doing this all the time, it can become painful,” said Evgeny. In order to bolster security, they also make use of many different wallets — that way, if someone gets unlucky, they’re able to contain the damage.\n\n**Do you get a lot of scammy content in your DMs?**\n\nRe7 receives *a lot* of scammy messages on their channels. As a rule of thumb, the only people who they respond to and communicate with are those who they actively know. Otherwise, they choose to block other DMs, around five to seven of which they receive daily on Twitter.\n\nEvgeny’s advice: If you get a message from someone you don’t know asking for information and/or help, it’s best to assume it’s a scam until proven otherwise\n\n**How does Re7 Capital evaluate risks when investing? Has the playbook changed in any way now that we’re in a bear market?**\n\nEvgeny pointed out the importance of distinguishing between real risk and the perception of risk. He compared dealings within DeFi with the oft-cited quote, “If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.” He commented that there’s a similar result in DeFi; in other words, “If you don’t know where the yield is coming from, you’re the yield.”\n\nIn regards to the current state of the market, Re7 sees how the perception of risk has affected how people manage their money. Because liquidity has dried up, the playbook has changed and is currently evolving at a rapid pace.\n\n### Thoughts on DAOs\n\nAs the conversation turned to the topic of DAOs, Evgeny went over a few key facts about Re7’s organizational structure: Re7 has its own investment fund, and Evgeny is a part of MetaCartel. The company is fully regulated and compliant in what they do, which ultimately protects them as a business. Re7 decided against moving to a DAO, but in general, they feel that certain organizational structures are relevant for a company’s respective use case.\n\nAccording to Evgeny, investment teams can either choose to be very open or opt for efficiency over openness. His team’s experience has demonstrated that communication in a more closed environment allows for making decisions instantly.\n\n### Final reflections\n\nTwo things that Evgeny is excited about looking ahead are NFTs and the metaverse. He was curious how the PWN team envisions the future of NFTs.\n\nAs Steve put it, “We need to see a proper marriage between NFTs and the DeFi ecosystem”. He recently dove into the importance of this topic during a talk on how to onboard a billion DeFi users (more on that in [our recent monthly digest](https://pwn.mirror.xyz/I6TjFg0MVUZx542XnKzsZDs1P4UzrOtrRk86a4i6lYQ)).\n\nIn the next six months, PWN will be able to do things with NFTs that web2 has never even dreamed of — so stay tuned! For now, check out the platform to:\n\n* See how much others are willing to lend\n* Check out the loans available at the moment\n* See other NFT collections that are currently listed\n* …and more!\n\n[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PWNFinance) to stay as up to date as possible on our team’s daily activities.\n\n\n---\n\n**A massive thank you to Evgeny and Re7 Capital for teaming up with us for this session. We’re excited to see where things continue to take us together.** ", "timestamp": 1658144795, "digest": "2SvdL9Jt2QR5IkatMqXxo7B2CIt9UK-T2_clqnMh_dI", "contributor": "0xb52a0e0CF7e6c50e003c07162F8762aDeD5c2539"}

VERI-ZEXE покращує сучасний рівень \\[1\\] приблизно в 9,0 разів при генерації транзакцій і в \\~ 2,6 рази при використанні пам’яті, і використовуватиметься в майбутніх версіях CAPE, щоб увімкнути довільну політику ресурсів, визначену користувачем, зберігаючи можливість налаштування конфіденційність активів.\n\nПерегляньте документ ePrint [тут](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/802.pdf) і GitHub [тут](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/veri-zexe).\n\n## ZEXE: історія та обмеження\n\n Системи розумних контрактів, такі як Ethereum і Solana, є чудовим середовищем для інновацій web3. Однак вони страждають від відсутності конфіденційності або масштабованості, а іноді і того, і іншого. Щоб забезпечити публічну перевірку, усі стани програм та зміни станів є публічними та прозорими, жертвуючи конфіденційністю, а всі транзакції чи обчислення повторно виконуються всіма (повними) вузлами, що впливає на масштабованість.\n\nУ 2019 році Боу та ін. запропонував схему під назвою децентралізоване приватне обчислення (DPC), яка дозволяє користувачам виконувати довільні обчислення поза ланцюгом і надсилати транзакцію, що засвідчує правильність цих обчислень, використовуючи докази з нульовим знанням \\[2\\]. Вони впровадили систему під назвою ZEXE (zk-виконання), яка створює екземпляр схеми DPC для вирішення обох проблемних моментів, наведених вище. Приблизно, ZEXE — це «програмований Zcash», узагальнений від системи з одним додатком до системи смарт-контрактів із збереженням гарантій конфіденційності.\n\nДеякі варті уваги особливості ZEXE:\n\n* **Конфіденційність даних і функцій**: ZEXE приховує всі стани програми, а також входи/виходи для викликів функцій (конфіденційність даних) і, що важливо, *які функції/програми викликаються* в кожній транзакції (конфіденційність функції). Навіть з численними подальшими альтернативними підходами до приватних смарт-контрактів, ZEXE залишається єдиною конкретною конструкцією, яка забезпечує конфіденційність функцій (див. [відповідний розділ роботи](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/802.pdf#subsection.1.1.3) в статті).\n\n\n* **Програмованість**: за допомогою ZEXE користувачі можуть приєднувати довільні правила/предикати до запису (подібно до ідеї Bitcoin Script), який визначає правила переходу для відповідних станів програми. Bowe та ін. показали, як програмувати визначені користувачем активи, DEX і стейблкоїни, що відповідають нормам, у моделі ZEXE.\n\n\n* **Коротка перевірка**: валідаторам у мережі не потрібно повторно виконувати обчислення. Натомість вони перевіряють короткі докази дійсності транзакцій, що займає постійний час, незалежно від того, наскільки дорогими є обчислення поза мережею.\n\nІснуючі реалізації (SnarkVM testnet 1 і SnarkVM testnet 2) забезпечують описані вище функції, але мають недоліки, які обмежують їх практичність і залишають багато можливостей для вдосконалення: \\[3\\]:\n\n* **Спеціальне налаштування схеми**: ZEXE (SnarkVM testnet1) використовує неуніверсальні SNARK, як-от GM17 і Groth16, для сертифікації правильності виконання смарт-контрактів, що забезпечує надійне налаштування для кожної програми, що є дуже непрактичним.\n\n\n* **Продуктивність**: ZEXE з універсальним SNARK (SnarkVM testnet2) зазнає значного погіршення продуктивності через вищу складність універсальної логіки перевірки SNARK і того факту, що ZEXE вимагає створення доказу SNARK для заяви, яка кодує логіку перевірки SNARK.\n\n## VERI-ZEXE: універсальне налаштування без втрати продуктивності\n\n\nVERI-ZEXE вирішує дві вищезазначені проблеми, зберігаючи всі функції та властивості оригінального ZEXE, запроваджуючи багато оптимізацій для зменшення складності схеми універсального гаджета верифікатора SNARK. Ми відсилаємо читачів до статті VERI-ZEXE для детального опису цих методів; у цьому дописі ми лише демонструємо та інтерпретуємо результати наших тестів.\n\nПо-перше, ми порівнюємо себе з найсучаснішими реалізаціями ZEXE, серед яких найважливіші показники включають час генерації транзакції (тобто алгоритм `Execute`), використання пам’яті та розмір підтвердження дійсності транзакції. Як показано нижче, наша продуктивність відповідає оригінальному неуніверсальному ZEXE. Порівняно з найкращою універсальною реалізацією ZEXE ми досягли **\\~9,0-кратного покращення генерації транзакцій** і **\\~2,6-кратного покращення використання пам’яті.**\n\n![Порівняння трьох реалізацій DPC для транзакції 2 входи-2 виходи, що працюють на AMD EPYC 7R13 на частоті 2,65 ГГц із 64 ядрами та 128 ГБ оперативної пам’яті.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rY8a286rowibKu_nFngdu.png?height=266&width=1270)\n\nПо-друге, ми надаємо детальніше порівняння з SnarkVM testnet2. Як показано нижче, розмір нашої зовнішньої схеми (яка використовується під час композиції перевірки глибини 2) набагато менший, і, отже, час перевірки на порядок швидший, що призводить до набагато швидшого створення перевірки для всіх параметрів транзакції:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SPBYiuOpU4eXLyGCjaVnH.png?height=968&width=1364)\n\nНарешті, щоб проілюструвати наші інновації в системі обмежень TurboPlonk і UltraPlonk, а також наші методи оптимізації, ми надаємо розбивку вартості обмежень для криптографічних будівельних блоків, які використовуються у VERI-ZEXE. Ми поділилися цими основними моментами щодо складності гаджетів, коли представили нашу бібліотеку Jellyfish на початку цього року.\n\nКількість PLONK обмежено для основних криптографічних будівельних блоків і алгебраїчних операцій. Ці цифри є специфічними для конструкції TurboPlonk.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/244YxLT5O1JV4p70X7Wwe.png?height=774&width=928)\n\n## VERI-ZEXE + CAPE: настроювана політика активів\n\nНезважаючи на те, що ZEXE не є ідеальним рішенням для приватних смарт-контрактів (через інші проблеми, згадані в \\[3\\]), це чудове рішення для додатків із мінімальними спільними станами серед користувачів, які насолоджуватимуться високим паралелізмом і низькою залежністю від транзакцій за умов Модель UTXO. Продукт [CAPE](https://www.espressosys.com/blog/cape-configurable-asset-privacy-for-ethereum) є чудовим прикладом того, як це може виглядати для користувачів.\n\nНаразі наш протокол CAPE підтримує лише попередньо визначений набір політик активів (наприклад, увімкнення карбування, анонімних передач, заморожування ключів, призначені політики перегляду тощо), але не підтримує динамічні, визначені користувачем політики активів. Уявіть, що ви хочете створити новий «концертний токен», який має загальну кількість 1000 одиниць і може бути викарбуваний, лише якщо певний актив буде сплачено на вказану адресу. Ця нова політика карбування, пов’язана з нашим новим токеном концерту, виходить за рамки того, що може застосовувати поточний продукт CAPE. Це загальна вимога та бажана функція для емітентів активів, щоб мати можливість розробляти індивідуальні, більш складні політики для своїх майбутніх активів. VERI-ZEXE зробить таку можливість програмування можливою.\n\n«VERI-ZEXE може служити основою для приватних смарт-контрактів. Порівняно з попередньою роботою, він підтримує універсальне налаштування та \\~9x прискорення генерації транзакцій, а також \\~2,6x економію використання пам’яті, підштовхуючи такі програми, як приватні стейблкоїни, з довільна, настроювана політика активів у сфері практичності», – каже Алекс Сюн, перший автор.\n\nБіньї Чен, головний криптограф Espresso Systems, додав: «Методики, що лежать в основі VERI-ZEXE, не обмежуються забезпеченням конфіденційності, але також допомагають у масштабованості. Наприклад, ті самі методи можна використовувати для оптимізації продуктивності так званих zk-zk -rollup, де зведення застосовується до форматів транзакцій із нульовим знанням (приватних), таких як CAP або Zcash.\"\n\nМи опублікуємо більше про наші розробки для вдосконалення CAPE у наступних публікаціях і дуже раді, що ці новаторські інновації принесуть Espresso. Залишайтеся на зв'язку!\n\n## Виноски\n\n\\[1\\]: SnarkVM від Aleo має багато ітерацій: їх версія testnet1 є досить точною реалізацією ZEXE, описаною в документі S&P19, яка вимагає довірених налаштувань для конкретної програми; рання версія testnet2 замінює систему доказів, яка використовувалася для створення доказів для предикатів народження/смерті, з GM17 на Marlin, роблячи систему «універсальною»; пізніша версія testnet2 і майбутні версії testnet відходять від оригінальної моделі DPC, спрощуючи модель, але обмежуючи її програмованість (наприклад, забороняючи міжпрограмний виклик). Нова, спрощена, але обмежена модель DPC, оскільки testnet3 виходить за межі цього блогу, а наш код порівнюється з testnet1 і попередньою версією testnet2. Ми внесли додаткові модифікації в їхній код, щоб зробити справедливе порівняння під час бенчмарку, див. докладніше в розділі 4.2 статті.\n\n\\[2\\]: Загальний потік обчислень поза ланцюгом і перевірки підтвердження цілісності обчислень у ланцюзі може звучати схоже на zk-rollup. Користувачі в ZEXE генерують підтвердження дійсності транзакції та надсилають транзакції безпосередньо в ланцюжок, тоді як користувачі в zk-Rollup надсилають транзакцію валідаторам зведення, які потім створять підтвердження zk для надсилання в ланцюг. Технічно ZEXE не хвилює, як виконується обчислення поза ланцюгом: одним користувачем, чи багатокористувацьким протоколом MPC, чи зведеним сервером, тому ми вважаємо ці два підходи взаємодоповнюючими.\n\n\\[3\\]: Є багато інших проблем із ZEXE, зокрема проблема паралельності (коли кілька користувачів намагаються одночасно перевести спільний стан у новий стан), можливість атомарної композиції (досягнення програми, подібної до Flashloan, у ZEXE потребуватиме техніки, яку ми називаємо «в -нагромадження пакетів», які трохи змінюють нано-ядро запису (RNK) ZEXE), складність програмування предикатів у моделі UTXO (існуюче рішення, таке як Chialisp). Ми спробуємо представити наші підходи до деяких із цих проблем у наступних публікаціях блогу.", "timestamp": 1658145126, "digest": "yk47ira6H0aBxcDu6OTM7YH1ZQYAd_BYkNF8edYdy5o", "contributor": "0x9b8EcC555143FC33b9809e7F4DC69179161208aE"}

A criatividade nas ideias é assombrosa. Existem iniciativas para[ distribuir de óculos a crianças](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12),[ criar uma marca de feijão exclusiva da Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/vote/97) e até um[ patrocinar um time de esportes radicais em nome da organização](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n8fhWrjrnUxMk4LE3JkGq.png?height=527&width=953)\n\n[Os dados](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vr6HSACMRce3SExF5tQNVIzqL8oPs5TOpgFRoYxWHbA/edit?usp=sharing) sugerem pouco interesse da comunidade em usar o tesouro para fomentar *public goods.* Somente 13%¹ destinaram-se a este objetivo, somando cerca de U$1.75M² do investimento aplicado em propostas pela DAO. Destacam-se as[ doações para a UNICEF](https://nouns.wtf/vote/42), ao[ instituto sem fins lucrativos do Tony Hawk](https://nouns.wtf/vote/40) e a campanha de[ distribuição de óculos para crianças](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/67zjdY3dSU_2KmStIampQ.png?height=552&width=1244)\n\nCom a intenção de viabilizar o acesso ao capital da Nouns para projetos de menor porte, em dezembro de 2021,[ uma proposta aprovada na DAO originou a Prop House.](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23) Seu diferencial é que qualquer um pode apresentar uma ideia e requerer fundos, mesmo sem possuir um NFT da organização.\n\n![Na Prop House, cerca de U$42 mil foram destinados a propostas voltadas para financiar bens públicos.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NvYxfbAZ5viecNzxMOphr.png?height=527&width=953)\n\nAté o momento, [192 projetos foram beneficiados](https://prop.house/) com o programa, a um custo de \\~U$150.000 para a Nouns DAO.

Ambas são fundamentais para a organização prosperar. Mas, para que a NounsDAO ganhe legitimidade além da criptosfera, parece prudente escapar à circularidade do modelo de \"*captar dinheiro para se auto-promover para captar mais dinheiro*\". Aqui vão 2 ideias:\n\n* **Desenvolver uma Prop House voltada para investimentos em *public goods.*** Nos moldes das Prop Houses que já existem..\n* **Estabelecer um comitê ou diretriz para *public goods*.** Recentemente, a DAO aprovou [a criação do Nouncil](https://nouns.wtf/vote/67): um comitê de membros com remuneração fixa, com base no histórico de participação em votações e discussões. Este comitê poderia debater e sugerir uma \"alocação desejada\" do caixa da comunidade para bens públicos, que sirva de diretriz, ou até designar um sub-comitê para fomentar esse tipo de iniciativa dentro da organização.\n\nAcima de qualquer crítica, vale ressaltar: uma pesquisa como essa só é possível por conta da transparência nos processos da NounsDAO. Este é, sobretudo, o olhar de um observador externo.\n\n[Como diria o Punk 4156](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12), um \"*pool* de capital de fato não-permissionado não tem como ter um propósito totalmente explícito\". Será sujeita ao \"mercado de ideias\", e as melhores vencerão.

Este poder ainda é difícil de perceber, pra quem habita fora da criptosfera. Como boa parte da indústria, Nouns ainda são extremamente auto-referenciais.\n\nO que significa \"*nounificar o mundo*\", afinal?

O significado dessa missão é fluido, e objeto de debate.\n\nJá se falou em tornar os óculos quadrados da Nouns DAO tão [conhecidos e desejados](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1509173517354418180) quanto marcas como [Nike](https://twitter.com/b00tgm/status/1521166004855922696), Gucci ou Ferrari.\n\nJá se postulou que a organização deva priorizar [investimentos em \"bens comuns\"](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12) (*public goods*): projetos educacionais, sociais ou que gerem benefícios coletivos.\n\nHá quem creia que um status como o de marcas famosas só será obtido caso a DAO consiga juntar as duas coisas: a vontade de ostentar com a capacidade de transformar o capital dos ostentadores em algo de útil para a sociedade.\n\n![Etapas para propostas serem apresentadas, votadas e executadas na governança da Nouns DAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j3GQmKIVZdJ4KJgx0ni0W.png?height=874&width=1600)\n\nDepois de um ano de vida, a Nouns DAO investiu \\~U$29.76M nas 102 propostas apresentadas em sua governança. A criatividade nas ideias é assombrosa. Existem iniciativas para[ distribuir de óculos a crianças](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12),[ criar uma marca de feijão exclusiva da Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/vote/97) e até um[ patrocinar um time de esportes radicais em nome da organização](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n8fhWrjrnUxMk4LE3JkGq.png?height=527&width=953)\n\n[Os dados](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vr6HSACMRce3SExF5tQNVIzqL8oPs5TOpgFRoYxWHbA/edit?usp=sharing) sugerem pouco interesse da comunidade em usar o tesouro para fomentar *public goods.* Somente 13%¹ destinaram-se a este objetivo, somando cerca de U$1.75M² do investimento aplicado em propostas pela DAO. Destacam-se as[ doações para a UNICEF](https://nouns.wtf/vote/42), ao[ instituto sem fins lucrativos do Tony Hawk](https://nouns.wtf/vote/40) e a campanha de[ distribuição de óculos para crianças](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/67zjdY3dSU_2KmStIampQ.png?height=552&width=1244)\n\nCom a intenção de viabilizar o acesso ao capital da Nouns para projetos de menor porte, em dezembro de 2021,[ uma proposta aprovada na DAO originou a Prop House.](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23) Seu diferencial é que qualquer um pode apresentar uma ideia e requerer fundos, mesmo sem possuir um NFT da organização.\n\n![Na Prop House, cerca de U$42 mil foram destinados a propostas voltadas para financiar bens públicos.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NvYxfbAZ5viecNzxMOphr.png?height=527&width=953)\n\nAté o momento, [192 projetos foram beneficiados](https://prop.house/) com o programa, a um custo de \\~U$150.000 para a Nouns DAO. Este dinheiro catalisou projetos de [reflorestamento](https://prop.house/proposal/149), [educação web3](https://prop.house/proposal/56) e até a criação de uma [marca de maconha da Nouns DAO](https://prop.house/proposal/112).\n\nNa Prop House, a baixa oferta de ideias voltadas a *public goods* permanece: **13,5% das propostas apresentadas na Prop House buscaram este fim.**\n\nDentre as propostas aprovadas, **27% voltam-se para *public goods*.** A porcentagem é maior em relação à governança principal da Nouns DAO, mas o dinheiro arrecadado via Prop House é substancialmente menor.\n\nHá um desequilíbrio entre iniciativas com benefícios coletivos e ações de marketing. Ambas são fundamentais para a organização prosperar. Mas, para que a NounsDAO ganhe legitimidade além da criptosfera, parece prudente escapar à circularidade do modelo de \"*captar dinheiro para se auto-promover para captar mais dinheiro*\". Aqui vão 2 ideias:\n\n* **Desenvolver uma Prop House voltada para investimentos em *public goods.*** Nos moldes das Prop Houses que já existem..\n* **Estabelecer um comitê ou diretriz para *public goods*.** Recentemente, a DAO aprovou [a criação do Nouncil](https://nouns.wtf/vote/67): um comitê de membros com remuneração fixa, com base no histórico de participação em votações e discussões. Este comitê poderia debater e sugerir uma \"alocação desejada\" do caixa da comunidade para bens públicos, que sirva de diretriz, ou até designar um sub-comitê para fomentar esse tipo de iniciativa dentro da organização.\n\nAcima de qualquer crítica, vale ressaltar: uma pesquisa como essa só é possível por conta da transparência nos processos da NounsDAO. Este é, sobretudo, o olhar de um observador externo.\n\n[Como diria o Punk 4156](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12), um \"*pool* de capital de fato não-permissionado não tem como ter um propósito totalmente explícito\". Será sujeita ao \"mercado de ideias\", e as melhores vencerão. Talvez o empurrão que a DAO precise para se conectar mais intimamente \"ao mundo material\" não venha de dentro, mas de fora.\n\n[4156 especulou](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12) que o \"superpoder da organização\" é \"proporcional à sua capacidade de tornar o mundo melhor para todos\". Este poder ainda é difícil de perceber, pra quem habita fora da criptosfera. Como boa parte da indústria, Nouns ainda são extremamente auto-referenciais.\n\nO que significa \"*nounificar o mundo*\", afinal?

"**Tokenomics**（トークノミクス）はクリプトプロジェクトにおいて最も重要な項目の一つ。\n\n「トークノミクスを理解しないと成功しない」という人も中にはいます。\n\n今回は[Covduk氏](https://twitter.com/Cov_duk)の協力を得てトークノミクスについてまとめました。\n\nプロジェクトやトークンに関する前提知識がないと少し難しい内容かもですが、できるだけ分かりやすくまとめたので本記事を読んでトークノミクスについて詳しくなりましょう。\n\n## トークノミクスとは?\n\nまず「トークノミクスとはなにか」と言われると一般的には、トークンの絡んだ経済やインセンティブという抽象的なものを指す言葉です。広義として以下のようなものを含みます。\n\n* トークンの仕組み\n* 需要と供給\n* トークンにまつわるメカニズム\n* インセンティブ、心理学、行動学\n* ゲーム理論\n\nなどなど、トークノミクスの語源にもなっている「**Token**」の「**Economics**」、経済の部分ですね。\n\n## 需要と供給\n\n「トークノミクス＝需要と供給」と過言ではないぐらい重要なポイント、まずはわかりやすいトークンの供給の部分から順番に見ていきましょう。\n\n### トークノミクスで生み出すトークンの供給\n\n供給量をコントロールすることで簡単にトークンに希少性を出すことが可能です。\n\n例えば需要が一定である場合、市場への供給量が少ないほど希少性により価値が上昇します。\n\nプロジェクトにおいては、トークンの価値を維持・上昇させるために、供給量を固定して過度なインフレを防ぐなどの工夫をいくつか行っています。\n\n* Bitcoin\n\nBitcoinを例に上げるとわかりやすいかもしれません。Bitcoinが通貨や資産として優れていると言われる理由の一つとしてこのトークノミクスが関係しているからです。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jX1Adfxkda-30eo1CVjwX.png?height=340&width=680)\n\nBitcoinの最大供給量は2100万枚で固定されており、すでに約90%に値する1910万枚が発行されています。ちなみにすべての供給予定量が一気に放出されるわけではありません。\n\nしかし、仮にいまの供給量が突如2倍になったらどうでしょう?\n\n昨日まで買えなくてプレミア価格だったPS5が、どこの店舗にも潤沢な在庫数になったイメージです。供給量が増加するともちろん価値は下がることが予測されます。\n\n話が少し脱線しますが、実はいま似たようなことが起きようとしているのをご存知でしょうか?\n\n* Mt.Gox事件のBitcoin返還\n\n供給量の変化によってもたらされる影響について懸念されているものの一つとして、8年前に人気だった取引所「Mt.Gox」から多くのBitcoinが盗まれたMt.Gox事件があります。\n\n事件によって失われた137,000BTCが返還されようとしています。\n\nBitcoinの供給量から見ると1%未満なものの、実際のところ毎日100%が現物で取引されて循環しているわけではないので、相当な売り圧になるとの予測もあります。\n\n自分も市場価格に大きな影響を与えると感じており、この件に関してはツイートもしくはmirrorに改めて投稿します。\n\n### 希少性の維持\n\n希少性が維持される条件として、上で挙げたBitcoinの方法など主に3つ存在します。\n\n* 最大供給量の決める（固定する）\n* 一部をBurnするトークン設計\n* トークンの紛失（いわゆるセルフGox）\n\nトークノミクスが不十分なものは、最大供給量および供給を定期的にコントロールして減らす仕組みがない事が多い。\n\n### Burnするトークン設計\n\nトークンは発行（Mint）とは逆の焼却（Burn）をすることもできます。\n\nやっていることは、自社株を買い戻しているのと似ています。\n\nこの仕組を採用している主要な暗号資産にはEthereumやBNBなどが挙げられる。今回はEthereumを例に見てみましょう。\n\n* Ethereum\n\nEthereumのマイナー報酬は大きく分けて、Static Base Reward（基礎報酬）の2ETHと、トランザクション手数料のチップの2種類が存在し、それらの合計がマイナーに支払われます。\n\n上のBurnの仕組みになったのはEIP-1559。手数料（ガス代）のマーケットメカニズムの変更に伴い、トランザクション手数料のチップを除くBase Fee（基本手数料）の部分をBurnする仕組みなりました。\n\nEIP-1559が採用されてからはEthereumのインフレの進行は遅まるどころかデフレトークンになりました。デフレトークンについては下で改めて説明しています。\n\nこのような形で、定期的もしくは何かをトリガーにBurnする仕組みを採用することで意図的に供給量のコントロールを行うこともできます。\n\n### 供給量＜供給率と時間軸\n\nここまで供給について話してきましたが、あくまで重要なのはトークンの総数ではないです。\n\n* 現在のトークン供給量\n* 現在のトークン供給率\n* 残りのトークンを発行する時間軸\n\nこの3つがトークンの供給にかかわる数字、要するに指標として存在します。\n\n仮にあるトークンの設計として、最大供給量を1億枚に設定していたとします。しかし、いまは30%の3000万枚しか市場に出回っていません。この場合は、残りの70%が大きな売り圧などになる可能性があり、トークンの価格に影響を与える可能性が大きくなってしまいます。\n\nそこで時間をかけてトークンを残りの発行してみます。トークンの残り70%を10年かけて放出したとしましょう。その場合、トークン放出による市場価格への影響はかなり小さいと言えるでしょう。\n\nでも70%を向こう1ヶ月で放出する場合はどうでしょう。最悪ですね、大きな売り圧になります。\n\nこのように供給量よりも供給率と時間軸が設計の上で非常に重要になってきます。\n\n### インフレトークン\n\n上でトークノミクスの悪い例として挙げたものの中にインフレトークンを言うものが存在します。\n\n* 供給量が一定じゃない\n* 無限に供給（発行）される\n* Burnの設計が一切ない\n\n供給量の増加に比例し、価値が減少する。いわゆるインフレですね。\n\nDOGEがその代表的な例として挙げられます。供給率は一定数（1分毎に1万枚）で、流通量に上限はありません。\n\n### デフレトークン\n\nインフレトークンとは反対にデフレトークンも存在します。\n\n* 供給量が一定\n* 供給量が減少していく\n* Burnの設計がされている\n\nデフレトークンは供給量を制限し、希少性を高めるという意味でとても良いことです。\n\n### 時価総額とFDV\n\n現在のトークンの価値を測る指標として、トークンの価格の他に時価総額とFDVが存在します。\n\n時価総額は聞き慣れている言葉だと思いますが、FDVはどうでしょう。\n\n* 時価総額\n\n時価総額とは、現在流通している額の総数で、現在の価格×**流通量**で計算できます。\n\n* FDV\n\nFDVとは、Fully Diluted Valuationの略で、日本語では完全希薄化価格といい、今後流通予定のものを含んだ数量の額の総数を指します。現在の価格×**最大供給量**で計算できます。\n\nここからは上の2つを例を上げて具体的に見ていきましょう。\n\n例えばあるトークンAの現在の価格が1ドルだとします。100枚のトークンが流通しており、最大供給量は1,000枚です。\n\nこの場合、時価総額は1×100で100ドル。FDVは1×1000で1,000ドルとなります。\n\n### 時価総額とFDVの比率\n\n時価総額とFDVの比率は、現在供給済みのトークンの割合を示します。\n\nトークンAの場合は1000÷100で10になり、より1に近い小さい数のほうが残りの供給量が少ないです。現在進行形で放出が進んでいるBitcoinは2100÷1910で1.099でかなり1に近い数字です。\n\n時価総額とFDVに大きな差がある場合は、この比率が大きくなり、まだ供給予定のトークンの多くがロックされており時間が経過するごとに放出され希薄化が進みます。\n\nどちらかといえば、プロジェクト運営側というよりもユーザー側の視点になりますが、供給の時間軸（タイミングやスケジュール）、どこからどこに供給れるものなのかを確認しておくことが賢いです。\n\nプロジェクトの成長速度より早いトークン供給によるインフレは大きな売り圧になります。\n\nなので運営側もそこは気をつけて設計する必要があるでしょう。\n\n### トークンアロケーション\n\n過度な供給や集中する供給が価格に対して与えるダメージが大きいことはここまで説明してきました。\n\n過度な供給は仕組みで防げますが、集中する供給はMt.Gox事件しか話してませんでした。\n\n起こりうる事例として実際どのようなものがあるでしょう。トークンの販売の部分から見てみます。\n\n* プライベートセール\n* フェアローンチ\n\nプライベートセールの場合、ローンチ時のトークン価格よりも大幅に割り引かれていることが多く、個人投資家以外にもVCなどがこのラウンドから投資を行いますが、権利が確定するまでには一定期間のロックアップが存在することが一般的です。COINLISTのIEOに参加経験のある人はわかりやすいと思います。\n\nこの場合、ロック期間が終わったときに一定の売り圧が発生する可能性が高くなります。\n\n一部回避する方法として、ロックアップ解除の時期をずらしたり、従来より長いロックアップ期間を許容してくれる投資家に対して、割引や多くステーキング報酬を付与インセンティブを付与する対処を行っています。\n\nこのような情報はCoinGeckoやCoinMarketCap等のサイトには載ってないことが多いので、代わりに公式のドキュメント等を見に行く必要があります。\n\n### VCが生み出す売り圧\n\nすべてのVCが圧力になるとは限りません。あるティア1クリプトVCは、「ロック期間が終わっても一切トークンを売ることはない。」と話してたような、してないような。\n\nトークンを手放す条件、要するに利確を行う条件として下記が考えられます。\n\n* 市況の悪化\n* 運用ファンドの不調\n* ロック解除時のインフレ率\n\nなど、アンロック時に売るインセンティブがどうしても強くなる状況がある。ここは運営側で制御できない部分の不可抗力も大きく、売られることを防ぐことは難しい。では、対策として何ができるのか。\n\n### 初期供給量の調整\n\n初期供給量を少なくしてしまえば、売られる額が市場供給量と比べて相対的に少なくなるから価格変動を極限まで押さえられるのではないか！実はこれは間違っています。\n\n硬い投資家はなぜBitcoinやEthereumを選ぶのか。それは希少性による資産性ですよね。これからの供給による希薄化が少ない、要するにHODLするインセンティブ（値上がりへの期待）の方が大きく、今手放すインセンティブが少ない設計に見せることができているからです。\n\n極端な話、初期供給量が10%のトークンの場合残りの90%を徐々に供給していく形となります。そうなると初期供給量が10%より大きいトークンよりも、初期投資家に与えるダメージは同じ成長度のプロジェクトだとしても比較して大きいと言えるでしょう。\n\n### 供給のトークン設計の分析方法\n\n投資家は下記項目を重点的に見る必要があり、運営サイドも注意する必要がある。\n\n1. トークンの流通量\n2. 供給量の上限があるかどうか\n3. ロックアップ解除のタイミングと割合\n4. Burnの設計を採用しているかどうか\n5. トークン供給のメカニズム\n6. トークンのインフレ率\n7. 供給増加による売却インセンティブ\n8. ロック解除時のインフレ率\n\n### トークノミクスで生み出すトークンの需要\n\nここまではいずれも、トークンの供給に関するもので、ここからはトークンの需要について見ていきましょう。\n\nどんなに供給のメカニズムを工夫して希少価値のあるものができたとしても、需要がなければなんの価値も生まれません。\n\nいま私が寝起きのセルフィーをNFTとしてミントしました。今後追加での発行予定はなく紛れもない1/1です。いままでの話を見ていると、この上なく最高の希少性だとわかりますが、誰もこんなもの要りません。\n\n需要とは様々な条件によって成り立っているのです。\n\n* 今後生まれる価値と収入\n* 実用性があるかどうか\n* 投機、ミームなど\n\n需要を適切にコントロール下に置くことで、リスクを取ってくれた初期参入者に対してインセンティブを発生させたり、トークン価格の上昇として還元することはどのプロジェクトも取り組むべき事項の一つです。\n\n### ユーティリティ\n\nユーティリティには様々な形が存在します。\n\n* 問題を解決するプロダクトやサービス\n* ガス代（チェーンのネイティブトークンなど）\n* プロトコルで利用されるトークン（ガバナンストークンなど）\n* 楽しみの提供（GameFi、音楽など）\n* コミュニティやイベント（BAYCなど）\n\n### 利回りなどのインセンティブ\n\nトークンを保有することによって報酬を得ることができる仕組みは大きな需要に繋がります。\n\nたとえば、RocketPoolでETHをステーキングすると4.03%、Lidoだと3.9%のAPRで報酬がもらえます。\n\nまた単なる金銭的な報酬だけじゃない場合も存在します。\n\n### ガバナンス\n\nトークンを保有するメリットとして、ガバナンスの権利が得られるというものがある。\n\nしかしこれは一般的なホルダーからして果たして魅力的なものなのだろうか?\n\n一定数の需要はあるにしろ。ユーティリティがコレだけでは盛り上がりにかける。\n\n### 高いAPY\n\n魅力的に見えるように高いAPYを見せて人とお金を集める手法がある。\n\n実際魔界などの別名を持ち人とお金が集まっているのでれっきとした需要と言えます。\n\nしかし、このAPYは一時的なものでお金が2倍流入すると半分の利回りになる。いくつかのプロトコルでは利回りを保証するものもあるがごく一部です。\n\n高いAPYは非常に魅力的だがリスクも存在する。\n\n利回りは低下する上に、トークンの価格も供給量が無限に増加していくので低下していくことが予想される。売ることもロクにできないゴミを保有しているも同然になることも多い。\n\nちゃんとしたサービスをローンチしたい場合は運営はなるべく避けるべき判断であることは確か。しかし設計によっては高APYも提供可能になるかも。\n\n### リベース\n\nこの手法はOlympusが導入したもので、株式分割に非常に似ています。\n\nホルダーは従来どおり、ステーキングを行うことでトークンを報酬として受け取ることができます。\n\nしかし供給は増加を続けるので、希薄分をステーキングしたトークンで受け取ることで事実上の保有比率を変えずとも運用可能にしました。\n\nいまでも高い290%の利回りを提供していますが、去年末は8,000%以上の高APYでした。\n\n### Airdrop\n\n特定の条件を満たすユーザーにトークンを無料で配布する手法です。\n\nコアなファンを作る意味でも、金銭的なインセンティブが得られるという期待感からも、運営・ユーザー共に人気の昔からある手段です。\n\nトークンを保有もしくはステーキングすることで、Airdropの対象になるケースや、抽選で配布を行うパターンがよく見られますが、先行利用してくれているユーザーに配布する事もあれば、自分たちのサービスではない特定のプロトコルを利用しているユーザーにばらまく場合もあります。\n\n最近だとCosmosのエコシステムでのエアドロが人気だとか。\n\n### ステーキングトークン\n\nステーキングして報酬が得られる仕組みはトークンの重要を生み出す仕組みとして非常に有用ですが、その文脈で更にブーストさせる方法が存在します。\n\nステーキングトークンとは、ステーキング及びロックしたトークンと引き換えに発行されるトークンのことです。\n\nスキーキングトークンを担保に暗号資産を借りたり、更に運用することができるのが魅力です。\n\n例えばLidoの場合、1ETHをステーキングすると引き換えに、1stETHを受け取ります。\n\nこの1stETHはDEXに流動性供給をおこないファーミングを行ったり、AAVEではstETHが担保として認められているので、stETHを担保にETHを借りてレバレッジステーキングができます。\n\n普通にステーキングよりもこのような形で更に運用できたほうがより多くの報酬が受け取れるので、トークンの需要は更に増すでしょう。\n\n### 投機とミーム\n\n人はお金が大好きで、もちろん投機も大好きです。私たちのこの感覚と同じように、市場も完全な合理性を持って動いているわけではないのが現状です。\n\n他の人が買っているから、信頼できるインフルエンサーが紹介していたから、前のコレクションも価格が上がったから今回のも買っておけば稼げる、やはりFOMOのようなものもあるだろうか。\n\nミームも一種の投機ではないか。クリプトは今までミームによって多大な恩恵を受けてきました。\n\n先程インフレトークンの代表的なものとして紹介したDOGEがはトークノミクスの観点から見ると明らかにクソトークンですが、時価総額10位に位置しています。国内取引所にも上場しています。\n\nそれは何を意味するのか、クリプトはコミュニティ主導で動いている。ミームそのものなのではないかと。\n\nミームによってブーストできる力もあるとして、一定数自分たちの追い風にしないといけないのかもしれない。\n\nいくら頑張って開発しても、ミーム＞トークノミクスの構造に自ずとなってしまっているものも多く存在する。\n\n* プロジェクトに対する強い愛\n* Discordでの活発さ\n* コミュニティに興奮はあるか\n\nこの3つがコミュニティを調査した上でいかにミーム的な付加価値を手供できるかどうかの重要なポイントとになりそうです。\n\n## さいごに\n\nここまでつらつらと書き連ねましたがこんな事をすべて考えて、念入りにトークンの設計をできるだろうか。自分でも書いていてめっちゃ難しいなあという認識です笑\n\nどれだけ完璧だと思う設計をしても、不可抗力や予期せぬことで価格の上下は少なからず起こるもの。\n\nでも完璧に近いトークノミクスを実現するため、経済学に詳しい教授などがトークノミクスのアドバイザーとしてプロジェクトに参画しているのをみてびっくりしました。\n\n価格の上下にユーザーと自分たちのモチベーションが振り回される環境で果たして「このサービスにトークンは必要なのか」問題は、個人的にめっちゃ話したいですがここで話すと長くなるのでまた別の機会に。\n\n長々と話しましたが少しでも参考になると幸いです。また、今回の記事にご協力いただきました[Covduk氏](https://twitter.com/Cov_duk)には改めて感謝します。ぜひフォローしてください！ではまた次のmirrorで会いましょう。\n\n\n---\n\nThank you so much Covduk! 😄\n\n協力: **[Covduk氏](https://twitter.com/Cov_duk)** / **[Tokenomicsのスレッド](https://twitter.com/Cov_duk/status/1547857503739711488)**", "timestamp": 1658145896, "digest": "A_4Zl4x_peQrMmAccPzpQfBDBoyIm8DX8kwc9N-n96U", "contributor": "0xcdaF4F9f8F9141a162f9CA7566FbaCD9237718b8"}

"「flipper访谈计划」是我们和多个NFT二级交易者的访谈合集。我们致力于对话各种风格的交易者，为二级市场交易抽丝剥茧，分享他们赚钱的经历，帮助更多NFT玩家实现稳定盈利。\n\nMartin是币圈老玩家，17年大学没毕业就踏入币圈，一举获得百倍收益，从EOS到合约无不涉猎。21年进入NFT领域，荷兰拍阶段入手红豆，之后都是翻十倍以上出手，仅凭一个项目就获得了超过50ETH的收益。Martin在Web3各个领域的经验，让他非常擅长从项目的初始阶段挖掘项目的潜力，Martin的社群在中文社区最早布局沙特白单，有社群成员通过邀请白单获得10个白单，收益20ETH以上。他还从白单阶段布局了godhates、火把等项目，都获得了不错的收益，也证明了他对项目的判断独特而精准。\n\n这次Martin和我们的访谈聚焦NFT领域从入门到精通各个阶段最应该做的事，和最应该学会的技巧。包括新手入门的方法，早期发现项目的技巧，和二级市场逃顶的方法论。相信不论你是刚进入NFT领域的新手，还是已经了解NFT一段时间的进阶玩家，都能在这篇访谈中得到一些技巧和答案。\n\n## 一 入门 对新手的建议\n\n对于新手来说，从一级市场拿白做起是一个比较好的方式，因为新手大多资金量有限，盲目从大项目开始买可能并不理智。那么，新手应该选择什么样的项目开始拿白和参与？可以看三点：\n\n### 1. 过于PUA的项目不做\n\n很多项目方有一个牛市遗留下来的习惯，就是要求用户做很多任务来获取白名单，包括邀请许多人进DC，在DC不断发言提升等级等等。这种方式拿白费时费力，在牛市的确可能赚钱，但在现今的熊市并不适用。以Martin的经验，这种过于PUA的项目方，往往最终发行的项目质量并不很高，因为他们只会通过比较原始的手段绑定用户，其营销能力令人质疑。而且肝白的时间给不了你任何成长，可以说毫无意义。\n\n相反，我们推荐新手做更容易获取白单的项目，比如评论邀请几个好友，顺手转发一下推特，或者在premint网站上登记一下地址，或者进DC频道发一下地址等。这种白单任务一两分钟就可以搞定，效率很高，能降低你的时间成本，把更多时间用来学习新知识，看新的项目。\n\n### 2. premint多准备几组账号\n\n许多针对新手的建议会说，多准备几个钱包用来打土狗，而Martin建议不仅钱包要准备多个，配套的twitter帐号和DC账号也要准备多个。特别是twitter账号，一定要准备和钱包相同的数量。\n\n因为现在众多优质项目都选择使用premint的方式抽白，同时在premint抽奖大多需要独立的钱包和推特。所以准备的账号组越多，获得白单的机会越高，赚取收益的可能性也就越大。\n\n### 3. 优先关注free mint的项目\n\n对新手来说，最应该优先关注的是freemint的项目。主要原因有二：\n\n一是freemint项目成本可控，即使打多个，也只需要付出gas，即使项目没起来也不会亏太多，风险比较小。\n\n二是一些付费mint的项目，其实质量上并没有比freemint项目高，反而项目方会因为付费mint获得的利益，在mint之后懈怠对项目的运作，这肯定对项目的长远发展不利，也会削弱项目的价值。最终反应到市场上，就是NFT价格下跌甚至归零。所以付费mint并不代表项目质量一定高，看项目还是要从各个方面综合判断。\n\n## 二 进阶 如何判断项目是否优质\n\n那么如何判断项目的质量？Martin向我们总结了三点：\n\n### 1. 通过项目方的外宣初步判断\n\n一级市场的项目，很多都会有预热，这时可以快速浏览一下项目方的推特，以及项目的相关信息，比如有没有知名的KOL或者共同关注点赞。同时也要关注项目的画风，到项目官网去看一下整体的构架等等，然后再决定是否mint。一般项目的官网的精良程度也决定了一个项目的精良程度，如果官网都做不好，项目大概率也不太行。\n\n同时也不能仅仅依靠推特粉丝来判断推，因为特粉丝这种东西比较虚，如果一个项目粉丝很多，但是没什么大V和KOL关注，也没有共同关注的好友，那么项目的粉丝极大概率是刷的。另外，推特下的评论互动也很重要，有的项目评论中一看就知道是机器人，这种项目方就大概率没什么运营水平。\n\n### 2. 通过创新度进一步判断\n\n优秀的项目一定要有创新度。比如哥布林，在哥布林之前，大家都认为NFT要「好看」，但哥布林打破了这个常规。而且哥布林本身的绘图质量很高，为后续的爆火提供了前提。可以说，哥布林的火，很大程度上取决于画风的创新和精美。\n\n而创新本身很难去定义，但当它出现的时候你就能发现。又如前段时间起飞的沙特人，它像素风的图可能第一眼并不陌生，看起来普普通通，但它是第一个把NFT主体定位到沙特地区文化的，这就是很好的创新，而后续的爆火基本是必然。\n\n所以考察NFT的质量，创新是必不可少的一个因素，而创新也是多维度的，不是只有图片创新，在合约，营销，运营，项目故事等任何一个方面有创新都有潜力。有创新性的NFT，几乎天生就比其他NFT优越，遇到这种项目一定不能错过。\n\n### 3. 通过社区获得优质信息\n\n在NFT圈，优质信息往往通过alpha群等核心圈子传播，这种优质社区中的信息价值非常高，往往在项目发布前就能判断出项目质量和后续走势。Martin自己也是Godjira和doodles社群的成员，同时也是优质信息的传播节点，成立了自己的社群。\n\n在社群中获得信息拥有极大优势，因为社群节约了你的时间成本和筛选环节，能直接把优质信息的传递效率提升到最高。如果你还未加入社群，也可以从Martin的推特和社群，或b4fomo的社群开始获得优质信息，迈出进入NFT核心圈的第一步。\n\n如果你通过这几点，判断出了某个项目是有质量的，那么就可以果断出手。不需要过于害怕亏损不敢mint，因为一级市场项目许多都是freemint，成本很低，可以不断试错，而抓住一次机会就能翻很多倍，盈亏比非常高。\n\n## 三 大成 土狗的逃顶策略\n\n经过mint阶段，下一步要做的就是在二级市场出手。这个阶段也是难度最高的，许多NFT玩家不是出手过早卖在低点，就是一直持有直到项目归零。那么如何判断出手的时机？怎样才能出在高点，获得最高的利润？Martin分享了以下三点技巧：\n\n### 1. 入手项目时接多个\n\nNFT和虚拟货币不同，如果只入手一个或者两个，很难做出理性的判断，涨上去想出手又害怕会继续上涨，价格出现下跌又会出现恐慌抛售。为了避免这种不理性的决策，在mint的时候就要尽量多买几只。尤其是对于free mint的项目，本身也没什么成本，这样下判断时才能更从容不迫，获得最大利益。\n\n对于看好的项目，Martin习惯一次接20个左右，这样分批出的时候更游刃有余，比如最近的BALUBA，Martin计算出单只成本3u左右，而这个项目的画风和热度都不错，很有潜力。于是果断mint了20个，即使中间有人砸盘也并不受影响，持有到高点0.04出手，分批出货，平均收益达到了15倍。\n\n### 2. 分批出货，对土狗不能有信仰\n\n对土狗来说，出货的好点位有两个。\n第一个点位是0.02-0.03，这个阶段适合用来回本，当你mint了多个时，可以在这时出掉一部分来回本，保证自己能全身而退。\n第二个点位是0.08-0.1，因为大部分free mint项目很难突破0.1，所以在项目冲到0.08到0.1这个阶段时，可以考虑分批出一些，带来一些盈利。\n\n而在项目出现向下的态势时，就需要考虑及时出货止损。如果你在0.02到0.03阶段已经出了一部分，其实已经覆盖了成本，所以这时候做决策会很从容，无论是留一个全出，还是再观望一段时间，实际上你都是不会亏的。\n\n如果看好项目的未来，决定长期持有，需要注意的是不能被项目方的信息带着走，盲目高估项目未来的价值。在目前的NFT市场，蓝筹是极少数，大多项目都只能火一段时间，当热度过去就没有了买盘，相当于砸在了手里。所以对土狗不能有信仰，按商业逻辑看待项目，才是理性的交易者应该做的。\n\n### 3. 从项目数据判断逃顶时机\n\n最准确判断逃顶时机的方法，还是从数据角度判断。一般挂单越来越多，而买盘开始走弱的时候，项目就到了短期的一个高点，这时候出手可以卖在顶部。\n\n同时，逃顶也要看点位。 当项目价格突破一个价格点位，比如上面提到的0.03，0.1等关键点位时，这个点位会变成支撑位，这个时候一般说明买盘良好，可以多持有看看，当发现买盘衰竭，也就是买单速度下降、买单数量减少时，再进行出手操作；而当项目跌破了支撑点位时，这个点位会变成压力位，短期内再冲上的可能性会变弱，这时挂单价格就需要谨慎，挂在高点很可能难以出手，可以尽快挂当前的地板价快速变现。\n\n而这些实时数据，在OS上是看不到的，所以必须配合工具来看。Martin常用的工具是parsec，同时也用b4fomo，parsec的优点是更专业，K线图和走势清晰，更适合资深玩家和有其他领域交易经验的交易者，b4fomo信息更全面，更适合新手。具体使用什么工具，可以结合自身的交易情况、对NFT交易的了解程度等等来决定。\n\n像买盘和卖盘的比例，价格点位分布，在b4fomo都能清晰地看到。而且b4fomo也有free mint的功能，帮助NFT玩家迅速找到市场上正在mint的所有土狗项目，并可以使用工具一键在合约端mint，既别别人快，还比别人安全。\n\n在访谈的过程中，Martin非常诚恳地介绍了他的NFT经验，这种共建共享的Web3精神也让我们钦佩。同时，Martin也在他的推特 <https://twitter.com/martin23_sen> 中分享他看好的优质项目，也组建了自己的社群，带着伙伴们一起从早期掘金。访谈最后，Martin对我们说，即使现在市场整体处于熊市，但NFT领域始终是局部的热点，不断会有机会涌现，任何在这个领域持续耕耘的人，会在之后的牛市获得意想不到的收获。\n\n您也可以在 <https://www.b4fomo.io/>

{"id": "bdG-6SGkDAPAJ_1quLCzhYy8GfBgMW5UAkOo-RMhNJ4", "title": "Analysis on NFT Liquidity: Problems & Solutions", "body": "## Introduction\n\nRecent waves of liquidation have triggered contagion fears in the crypto market, spreading from Three Arrows Capital to crypto lenders like Celsius Network, Babel Finance, BlockFi and Voyager Digital. Billions of dollars have been wiped off the market in the past few weeks due to the collapses and the slump in digital asset prices.\n\nLiquidity issue is not only fatal to the development of DeFi but also (if not more of) such a case in NFT. In this report we will focus on NFT liquidity problems and solutions as it is seen as the major gateway to web3 given its lower threshold and more diverse use cases.\n\n## This report will cover the following topics:\n\nI. Briefly describe current liquidity problems in NFTs\n\nII. Why is there insufficient liquidity for NFTs?\n\nIII. What are the existing solutions for NFT liquidity?\n\nIV. Other thoughts for NFT liquidity solutions\n\nV. Closing thoughts\n\n## I. What are the NFT Liquidity Problems?\n\nDespite NFT’s exuberance in 2021 and early 2022, the level of NFT transaction activity can only be described as lukewarm compared to DeFi. [Top 15 NFT marketplaces](https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces) have taken up the absolute majority of the global NFT market share and yet its aggregate trading volume is sub-2% of that of [decentralized crypto exchanges](https://dune.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics), let alone centralized exchanges which [reported a whopping $14trn+](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nsav-announces-completion-major-upgrades-150900024.html#:\\~:text=Centralized%20crypto%20exchanges%20reported%20more,as%20of%20December%2024%2C%202021.) in trading volume in 2021.\n\n![Data is updated as of Jul 6, 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySnL5A7pUUeWFbipnTWIS.png?height=288&width=919)\n\nThe NFT market fluctuations contributed by the current whale centralization also adds up to the liquidity problem. Across most of Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces, 0.06% of whales (with $1mn+ NFT holding value) hold NFTs worth $5.7bn and take up 25.7% of the $22.2bn global NFT market cap [as of Jul 6, 2022](https://nftgo.io/whale-tracking/list).\n\n![Data is updated as of Jul 6, 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BzmtrW9e3LBHHO-XQb8qy.png?height=92&width=649)\n\n## II. Why is NFT Liquidity Insufficient?\n\n(1) What sets non-fungible tokens (NFTs) apart from fungible tokens is its uniqueness in rarities and utilities. While fungible token investors can easily trade tokens like Ethereum and Solana via DEXs / AMMs, the pool of buyers for each NFT sale is much smaller and hence the relatively smaller trading volume shown above. \n\n(2) NFT, despite its huge imagination with the narrative of ‘moving’ current physical assets on-chain, is still very novel to the mass market. The lack of historical data points and widely accepted valuation analysis is a key reason for the high speculation and pricing difficulty. Even NFTs within the same collection can be valued at significantly different prices due to rarity stats and subjective opinions. This leads to the low liquidity and unideal capital efficiency.\n\n(3) Similar to illiquid assets like real estates, blue-chip NFTs are listed at a high price range of US$11K-120K on average even amid the bear market. The high entry price has caused many novel investors losing their appetites, giving rise to the advocate of NFT Fractionalization, which we will discuss in the section later.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RnFVVDwFvWSq8HDCa3V3K.png?height=674&width=1156)\n\n(4) Many NFT investors are investing with a diamond hands strategy and are not willing to sell their NFTs in exchange of immediate liquidity. Hence, the development of NFT financialization is a much heated topic when it comes to resolving NFT liquidity problems.\n\n## III. Existing NFT Liquidity Scaling Solutions\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ni8Mm4sSWYskjDQuNOtkz.png?height=999&width=1456)\n\n### Category A: NFT Trading & Value-adding Protocols\n\nThe market has seen the touting of these DApps and infrastructure protocols to facilitate NFT peer-to-peer trading in a smoother and less costly way: 1) NFT marketplace aggregators, 2) price discovery tools, 3) decentralized NFT trading protocols, and 4) NFT fractionalization.\n\n#### (1) NFT marketplace aggregators \n\nNFT marketplace aggregators are likely the most notable ones among current NFT liquidity solutions. An ggregator platform consolidates NFT listings across most of NFT marketplaces and provides unprecedented visibility to NFT investors. Moreover, by allowing users to make bulk purchase it saves them gas fees by up to \\~40%. Currently, the top 3 aggregator brands are Gem ([acquired by OpenSea](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-gem-to-invest-in-pro-experience/)), Genie ([acquired by Uniswap Labs](https://uniswap.org/blog/genie)) and Flip.\n\n![Gem, Genie, Flip](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IJ08mDCguNzRSSbv8Zc1i.png?height=468&width=1456)\n\nThe recent acquisitions of [Gem](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-gem-to-invest-in-pro-experience/) and [Genie](https://uniswap.org/blog/genie) show that aggregators are an effective front-end tool for individual marketplaces / DeFi pools to gain user traffic. They also allow for lower gas fees via bulk purchases and reduce frictions for NFT buyers. But despite the hype around NFT aggregators this year, they’re fundamentally akin to Deliveroo / Booking.com in web2 as they only aggregate information like NFT listing and pricing without injecting additional liquidity into the NFT market. \n\n#### (2) Price discovery tools\n\nThis type of tools has emerged to solve the pricing difficulty and high speculation of NFTs, assisting users with their investing decisions. Furthermore, price discovery helps lay a crucial foundation for the development of NFT financialization. Unlike fungible tokens where the market prices are easily synced, NFT’s pricing is much trickier as the bid, ask and realized price can be rather inconsistent given its P2P trading feature.\n\nCurrently, there’re several price discovery methodologies:\n\n**(a) Auctions** particularly suit NFTs with high ticket values as they do in the traditional world. Opposite to the traditional English style with an ascending pricing model, Dutch auction that adopts a descending price method is widely adopted in NFT auctions where artists and auctioneers inform all potential collectors and gather all their bidding prices ahead of the auction to set the ceiling price. Then the auction will start at the ceiling price and drop by XX% for every predetermined period of time until all NFT collections get sold out at bidders’ designated bidding prices. \n\nAuctions are in favor of NFT issuers but the market capital efficiency is hugely sacrificed for an accurate pricing result, given that they lock up bidders’ capital which in aggregate mostly likely surpass the value of the NFT being bidded for.\n\n**(b) NFT oracles** like Chainlink can retrieve NFT collections’ floor prices from blockchains and compute their time weighted average prices (TWAP). This can provide investors with a reference price range by tracking the average prices.\n\nHowever, its limit is it requires a huge transaction amount for the TWAP to be accurate and for that reason it’s also susceptible to oracle attacks and market manipulations.\n\n**(c) Machine learning-driven algorithms** serve well for NFT collections with relatively abundant data points (e.g. rarity stats and traits) as it’s more effective to utilize quantitative analysis to do the price prediction.\n\nFor instance, NFTBank, an integrated NFT asset management firm, provides price discovery for \\~1,900 NFT projects. It’s powered by a machine learning model with data inputs such as NFT metadata, sales history, trait values, categories, time of sales and more.\n\nAnother example is Upshot, which has developed specialized machine learning algorithms that ingest historical sales data, secondary market data, and NFT metadata to generate reliable appraisals. Using the algorithms, Upshot reprices 270K+ top NFT items including Bored Apes, Art Blocks and CryptoPunks every hour.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ri3-203yGo4Fw2jSX73hi.png?height=502&width=764)\n\nSince ML-driven algorithms require a large amount of data points to arrive at computational results, it’s more meaningful for NFT collections with rich historical sales data, rarity stats and traits, and lower volatility. Investors may find it inaccurate for newly minted NFT projects that have less comparable traits in the market.\n\n**(d) Peer-based appraisals** include both mechanisms of 1) manual voting/recommendation and 2) behavior analysis and prediction. It’s hard to compute quantitative results for NFTs that are more subjectively priced like digital arts and thus collective judgment is probably a more reliable type of appraisal for such types.\n\nThe above-mentioned project, Upshot, also has its own NFT appraisal protocol that has established a set of data by incentivizing users to provide honest feedback and recommendations for NFT projects. It has built out the API for developers to integrate their data into various projects.\n\n#### (3) Decentralized NFT trading protocols\n\nOpenSea has announced in mid-June to migrate to Seaport Protocol, an open-source web3 marketplace protocol designed for safely and efficiently trading NFTs. OpenSea has moved one step ahead of its centralized DeFi peers by launching the protocol that features \\~35% lower gas fees, discloses on-chain transactions transparently and allows for forking by other developers.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/66x-rasPvYHxPzw_73sy4.png?height=637&width=1456)\n\nThis move lowers the threshold for developers to build their own NFT marketplaces and moves transaction data on-chain. It may remove the pain points of many existing NFT tooling platforms as they can build their own marketplaces on top of Seaport Protocol, capturing value off their existing user base who normally come to find alphas and then switch to other marketplaces/aggregators for execution.\n\nHowever, given the novelty of this protocol, whether it can actually create a liquidity network effect among the NFT tooling platforms is yet to be examined. One thing is for sure, we look to see more development in the space of permissionless NFT trading protocols.\n\n#### (4) NFT fractionalization \n\nNFT fractionalization means splitting a given NFT into multiple pieces which can be individually traded in the market. The process involves a s smart contract that divides ERC-721 tokens into a number of F-NFTs or fungible ERC-20 tokens. Since these ERC-20 tokens can be tapped into DeFi systems and valued by the market via yield farming on AMMs, it can hugely improve the price discovery and liquidity. Another more apparent reason is it encourages decentralization and democratization by allowing normal investors to gain exposure to otherwise high-value NFT items.\n\n![The splitting of a CryptoPunk NFT into 100 ERC-20 tokens](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ms6mLS4JpzGlC9uB0RAq-.png?height=282&width=600)\n\nOne of the most notable projects in this realm is fractional.art. One can connect a web3 wallet to fractional.art to purchase fractionalized NFT items which is in the form of ERC-20 tokens. As a fractionalized NFT token holder, you can participate in the vote of the NFT’s floor price. The platform has also set up a 7-day auction feature which can be triggered when an investor intends to buy up all the fractions of an NFT, i.e. to own the whole piece, so that everyone can participate in the bidding process.\n\nPartyBid, developed by PartyDAO, has an NFT auction platform that supports NFTs on several marketplaces including OpenSea. Anyone can launch a ‘Party’ to contribute ETH to collectively bid for fractions of an NFT. This is achieved via PartyBid’s MarketWrapper contract which provides a general interface to aggregate all NFT bids. PartyBid is built on fractional.art to fractionalize the NFTs that are successfully bidded. Successful bids will get charged a 2.5ETH fee and 2.5% of the token value which will be transferred to the PartyDAO’s vault.\n\n![PartyBid](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G3F-FTZBiq1eQaeY_ri-S.png?height=371&width=1282)\n\nWhile NFT fractionalization may be the next big trend given its positive impact created around democratization and liquidity, it’s not without risk. F-NFTs may give rise to regulatory issues as they are likely treated as unauthorized ICOs. SEC’s commissioner Hester Peirce warned in 2021 that F-NFTs may be considered to be securities. Additionally, managing intellectual property rights and publicity rights can be tricky and complex subject to the traits and types of NFTs.\n\n### Category B: Passive Income for Diamond-Hand NFT Investors\n\nAs we mentioned in the beginning of this report, one of the key factors that contributes to the NFT liquidity problem is investors prefer holding NFT assets and not realizing their profits. To resolve the liquidity issues derived from this behavior, 3 main measures mirrored from existing traditional finance world are aiming to serve these long-term NFT investors: 1) NFT-backed loans/ Collateralized Loan Positions (CDPs), 2) NFT liquidity pools and 3) NFT renting/lending.\n\nBoth of them provide passive income streams and improve capital efficiency for NFT investors while supplying extra liquidity to the market. Also note that many platforms under this category have incorporated the solutions under Category A since they serve for these 2 types of measures in various ways.\n\n#### (1) NFT-backed loans / CDPs\n\nAs compared to the global fine art market where the debt penetration is \\~35% ($24bn/$65bn), NFT debt penetration is only 0.5% (\\~$250mn/$37bn) as of May 1st, 2022 and hence is expected to boost the liquidity as the total market size grows.\n\nThere’re 2 types of loan issuers: peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-protocol (P2Protocol). The majority of loans are issued through P2P loan platforms such as NFTFi and Arcade. The rest are issued by P2Pool loan suppliers such as BendDAO, DropsDAO, PineDAO, Goblin Sax and etc.\n\nCurrent total addressable market for NFT-backed loans is over $250mn by loan volumes. With a higher volatility, NFTs loan lenders can get higher expected returns than traditional crypto-backed loans.\n\n**a) P2P NFT-backed lending platforms**. The two largest players in this space are NFTFi and Arcade, of which the aggregate loans issued to date has amounted to \\~$240mn. Currently, only blue-chip NFTs are supported on these P2P platforms given the high volatility and uncertainty in other long-tail NFT items.\n\nNFTFi is built on top of the NFT lending protocol, MetaStreet. It allows NFT owners to borrow wETH or DAI using their NFTs as collaterals and lenders get to earn interests by supplying these loans. NFTFi’s 90-day loans require an APR up to 1,000%  while longer-duration loans’ average at \\~90%. The company has handled a loan volume of [$217mn ](https://dune.com/rchen8/NFTfi)across 13,363 loans since its May-2020 inception (as of Jul 5, 2022). NFTFi charges 5% on lender’s interest revenue upon successful loans (excluding defaulted ones). Some of the collatealized NFT include wrapped Crypto Punks (\\~29% of loans) and BAYC (23% of loans).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sJB-Fpf2ooUJg6cGfVosO.png?height=599&width=1300)\n\nArcade ($20mn) is built on the Pawn protocol and has facilitated \\~$20mn loans since inception in 2022. Other than wETH and DAI, users can also borrow USDC by collateralizing NFTs from the selected [list](https://contracts.arcade.xyz/). Unlike NFTFi, Arcade charges borrowers a fixed 2% of principal upfront when the loan is originated.\n\nNeither of the above P2P lending platforms underwrites any risk and does not rely on algorithmic pricing to scale. However, the scalability is limited by its bespoke loan terms and potentially slower matching as borrowers must wait for counteroffers. \n\n**b) P2Protocol NFT-backed loans**\n\nThe size of P2Protocol lending market is still small ($30mn-$50mn). Major players include BendDAO, Drops, Pine, Goblin Sax, JPEG’d and Defrag. Some lending platforms, e.g. BendDAO, adopt vote-escrow tokenomics to incentivize NFT holders to supply liquidity in various loan pools. Similar to DeFi liquidity pools, they emit governance tokens to boost interest rates for lenders.\n\nTo resolve P2P lending marketplaces’ slow matching issue, P2Protocol lending projects allow for instantaneous time-to-liquidity as the matching process is handled by the protocol. But the downside is automating loan terms requires rich data points such as real-time prices and rarity stats, and hence limiting the NFT selections to the already liquid ones with quantitative properties.\n\nEven with the over-collateralization (50% at least) for NFT-backed loans, NFT-backed lenders still assume a bigger risk than traditional crypto asset-backed loan providers due to a higher possibility of “voluntary” defaults. This happens if borrowers give up on repaying loans when the value of NFT is less than loan amount. To mitigate such risks, accurate price discovery, credit risk analysis and insurance are all crucial value-added services that many lending platforms have integrated or are actively exploring.\n\nInspired by NFT marketplace aggregators, NFT-backed loan aggregators and infrastructures may be on the next trend as NFT lending marketplaces are still fragmented (esp. in P2Protocol). Apart from [MetaStreet](https://metastreet.xyz/) mentioned above, Spice Finance is a newer project that aims to consolidate existing P2Protocol loans onto one single platform by integrating various NFT P2Protocol protocols. On top of that it has built out a machine-learning NFT appraisal tool and credit risk system to underpin the integrated loan platform.\n\nThe biggest risk for such aggregators comes from the high level of integration and composability as the projects inherit the risks of all the underlying applications.\n\n### (2) NFT liquidity pools\n\nNFT liquidity pools can be categorized into staking liquidity pools and trading liquidity pools, which are mirrored from [DeFi liquidity pools](https://www.huobi.com/learn/en-us/what-are-liquidity-pools/). The main variation is users can mint fungible tokens (e.g. ERC-20 tokens) by depositing NFTs of similar traits/floor prices into the same liquidity pool. The fungible tokens are a representation of and can be swapped for any random assets in the pool. Liquidity providers can enjoy faster time-to-liquidity by depositing NFTs, minting corresponding fungible tokens and swapping them easily via DeFi AMMs (e.g. Sushiswap if using NFTX). Apart from NFTX, another key platform is [NFT20](https://nft20.io/). As liquidity pools involve the minting of fungible tokens, this types of services is often times powered by NFT fractionalization protocols.\n\nSame as DeFi, users can arbitrage out an NFT if it’s mispriced and hence facilitate the price discovery. Additionally, liquidity providers usually get LP tokens and can stake them for boosted rewards. Given NFT’s higher volatility and speculation, however, the risk of slippage may be a challenge for both platforms and investors to handle.\n\n### (3) NFT renting \n\nRenting provides another direction for NFT owners to generate passive income. Double Protocol’s ERC-4907 standard has just become the 30th official ERC standard on Ethereum, which takes an innovative approach by adding an ‘expires’ feature that authorizes automatic expiration for the ‘user’. In this way, projects that are built upon ERC-4907 standard can easily segregate users’ ownership from the right of use that will automatically cease upon the end of the renting period. This will fuel up the development of NFT renting and give rise to more derivatives built around it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/za6apYezbkD4dgOQkMS8X.png?height=675&width=1200)\n\nNFT renting can be applicable to a variety of use cases including gaming, art, PFP, membership NFTs and so on. For example, art exhibitions, brands or events may rent out specific digital art NFTs that match with their pop-up shows/events. Or someone who want to join a community for a period of time before making a long-term commitment may rent out a membership NFT for one month (sounds like subscription to paid contents).\n\nThe most promising use case for NFT renting is gaming given the imagination of the size of metaverse. Virtual lands may drive up some hypes as many owners invested in a large amount of lands so that they can count on them to generate passive rental income from different types of uses as the game onboards more users and brands. Furthermore, in-game assets such as skins, gears,  pets, characters and other items are either required to play the game or granting advantages to players. You may find an example from my [article](https://cmsdaisy.medium.com/will-defi-kingdoms-be-the-mega-blockchain-game-in-the-long-term-ddab85d4a650) about how players rent out the Hero characters in the game. In cases where players can’t afford or simply don’t want to buy in-game NFTs due of all sorts of reasons, they will opt for renting, boosting NFT liquidity further.\n\n## IV. Other Thoughts for NFT Liquidity Solutions\n\nWhen it comes to NFT trading, what can drive liquidity further seems to come from communities where users are aligned on tastes and values for the NFT projects that grow out of the community. Often times, the marketplace is a vertical one which is decided by the theme / vibe of the community behind. Such an NFT marketplace is great for NFT projects to exert the tokens’ influence and utilities among community members. Project owners will also have this sense of belongingness and ownership as they can take part in the voting of marketplace design to deliver certain user experience. \n\nDAOs sound like an organic place for such a marketplace to develop especially with the aforementioned Seaport Protocol that lowers the threshold of developing. Additionally, centralized NFT marketplaces are also actively exploring the community features, such as [Coinbase’s beta version](https://nft.coinbase.com/) of its NFT marketplace has a focus on creating a social community for both buyers and sellers.\n\n## V. Closing Thoughts\n\nAll the above liquidity solutions are trying to resolve issues based on the current NFT market size. What drives NFT liquidity fundamentally in the long term will have to come from its own penetration in various industries. \n\nWe are on an exciting journey into the future of NFTs, where we’ve seen prestigious businesses and celebrities from sports, fashion brands, music streaming services and education forming their partnerships with metaverse-like projects and blockchain technologies. The ultimate way to boost the NFT liquidity is through mass adoption. Along the journey of NFT financialization and further adoption, NFT trading platforms are likely to be made subject to more stringent regulations regarding anti-money laundering and security investments.\n\nFasten your seat belt and stay tuned.", "timestamp": 1658146209, "digest": "fy5xHf5GTFEFDqUWIO0ZZAFVG61D6g5yYdWCRLpVDgA", "contributor": "0x520E805E3C91c5A047C67e589476884587978Fd1"}
{"id": "c-z9oSv4OvOuTRCYZzXv7jhM1wpOleE2Hb91faiiTX8", "title": "Analysis on NFT Liquidity: Problems & Solutions", "body": "## Introduction\n\nRecent waves of liquidation have triggered contagion fears in the crypto market, spreading from Three Arrows Capital to crypto lenders like Celsius Network, Babel Finance, BlockFi and Voyager Digital. Billions of dollars have been wiped off the market in the past few weeks due to the collapses and the slump in digital asset prices.\n\nLiquidity issue is not only fatal to the development of DeFi but also (if not more of) such a case in NFT. In this report we will focus on NFT liquidity problems and solutions as it is seen as the major gateway to web3 given its lower threshold and more diverse use cases.\n\n## This report will cover the following topics:\n\nI. Briefly describe current liquidity problems in NFTs\n\nII. Why is there insufficient liquidity for NFTs?\n\nIII. What are the existing solutions for NFT liquidity?\n\nIV. Other thoughts for NFT liquidity solutions\n\nV. Closing thoughts\n\n## I. What are the NFT Liquidity Problems?\n\nDespite NFT’s exuberance in 2021 and early 2022, the level of NFT transaction activity can only be described as lukewarm compared to DeFi. [Top 15 NFT marketplaces](https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces) have taken up the absolute majority of the global NFT market share and yet its aggregate trading volume is sub-2% of that of [decentralized crypto exchanges](https://dune.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics), let alone centralized exchanges which [reported a whopping $14trn+](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nsav-announces-completion-major-upgrades-150900024.html#:\\~:text=Centralized%20crypto%20exchanges%20reported%20more,as%20of%20December%2024%2C%202021.) in trading volume in 2021.\n\n![Data is updated as of Jul 6, 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySnL5A7pUUeWFbipnTWIS.png?height=288&width=919)\n\nThe NFT market fluctuations contributed by the current whale centralization also adds up to the liquidity problem. Across most of Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces, 0.06% of whales (with $1mn+ NFT holding value) hold NFTs worth $5.7bn and take up 25.7% of the $22.2bn global NFT market cap [as of Jul 6, 2022](https://nftgo.io/whale-tracking/list).\n\n![Data is updated as of Jul 6, 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BzmtrW9e3LBHHO-XQb8qy.png?height=92&width=649)\n\n## II. Why is NFT Liquidity Insufficient?\n\n(1) What sets non-fungible tokens (NFTs) apart from fungible tokens is its uniqueness in rarities and utilities. While fungible token investors can easily trade tokens like Ethereum and Solana via DEXs / AMMs, the pool of buyers for each NFT sale is much smaller and hence the relatively smaller trading volume shown above. \n\n(2) NFT, despite its huge imagination with the narrative of ‘moving’ current physical assets on-chain, is still very novel to the mass market. The lack of historical data points and widely accepted valuation analysis is a key reason for the high speculation and pricing difficulty. Even NFTs within the same collection can be valued at significantly different prices due to rarity stats and subjective opinions. This leads to the low liquidity and unideal capital efficiency.\n\n(3) Similar to illiquid assets like real estates, blue-chip NFTs are listed at a high price range of US$11K-120K on average even amid the bear market. The high entry price has caused many novel investors losing their appetites, giving rise to the advocate of NFT Fractionalization, which we will discuss in the section later.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RnFVVDwFvWSq8HDCa3V3K.png?height=674&width=1156)\n\n(4) Many NFT investors are investing with a diamond hands strategy and are not willing to sell their NFTs in exchange of immediate liquidity. Hence, the development of NFT financialization is a much heated topic when it comes to resolving NFT liquidity problems.\n\n## III. Existing NFT Liquidity Scaling Solutions\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ni8Mm4sSWYskjDQuNOtkz.png?height=999&width=1456)\n\n### Category A: NFT Trading & Value-adding Protocols\n\nThe market has seen the touting of these DApps and infrastructure protocols to facilitate NFT peer-to-peer trading in a smoother and less costly way: 1) NFT marketplace aggregators, 2) price discovery tools, 3) decentralized NFT trading protocols, and 4) NFT fractionalization.\n\n#### (1) NFT marketplace aggregators \n\nNFT marketplace aggregators are likely the most notable ones among current NFT liquidity solutions. An ggregator platform consolidates NFT listings across most of NFT marketplaces and provides unprecedented visibility to NFT investors. Moreover, by allowing users to make bulk purchase it saves them gas fees by up to \\~40%. Currently, the top 3 aggregator brands are Gem ([acquired by OpenSea](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-gem-to-invest-in-pro-experience/)), Genie ([acquired by Uniswap Labs](https://uniswap.org/blog/genie)) and Flip.\n\n![Gem, Genie, Flip](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IJ08mDCguNzRSSbv8Zc1i.png?height=468&width=1456)\n\nThe recent acquisitions of [Gem](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-gem-to-invest-in-pro-experience/) and [Genie](https://uniswap.org/blog/genie) show that aggregators are an effective front-end tool for individual marketplaces / DeFi pools to gain user traffic. They also allow for lower gas fees via bulk purchases and reduce frictions for NFT buyers. But despite the hype around NFT aggregators this year, they’re fundamentally akin to Deliveroo / Booking.com in web2 as they only aggregate information like NFT listing and pricing without injecting additional liquidity into the NFT market. \n\n#### (2) Price discovery tools\n\nThis type of tools has emerged to solve the pricing difficulty and high speculation of NFTs, assisting users with their investing decisions. Furthermore, price discovery helps lay a crucial foundation for the development of NFT financialization. Unlike fungible tokens where the market prices are easily synced, NFT’s pricing is much trickier as the bid, ask and realized price can be rather inconsistent given its P2P trading feature.\n\nCurrently, there’re several price discovery methodologies:\n\n**(a) Auctions** particularly suit NFTs with high ticket values as they do in the traditional world. Opposite to the traditional English style with an ascending pricing model, Dutch auction that adopts a descending price method is widely adopted in NFT auctions where artists and auctioneers inform all potential collectors and gather all their bidding prices ahead of the auction to set the ceiling price. Then the auction will start at the ceiling price and drop by XX% for every predetermined period of time until all NFT collections get sold out at bidders’ designated bidding prices. \n\nAuctions are in favor of NFT issuers but the market capital efficiency is hugely sacrificed for an accurate pricing result, given that they lock up bidders’ capital which in aggregate mostly likely surpass the value of the NFT being bidded for.\n\n**(b) NFT oracles** like Chainlink can retrieve NFT collections’ floor prices from blockchains and compute their time weighted average prices (TWAP). This can provide investors with a reference price range by tracking the average prices.\n\nHowever, its limit is it requires a huge transaction amount for the TWAP to be accurate and for that reason it’s also susceptible to oracle attacks and market manipulations.\n\n**(c) Machine learning-driven algorithms** serve well for NFT collections with relatively abundant data points (e.g. rarity stats and traits) as it’s more effective to utilize quantitative analysis to do the price prediction.\n\nFor instance, NFTBank, an integrated NFT asset management firm, provides price discovery for \\~1,900 NFT projects. It’s powered by a machine learning model with data inputs such as NFT metadata, sales history, trait values, categories, time of sales and more.\n\nAnother example is Upshot, which has developed specialized machine learning algorithms that ingest historical sales data, secondary market data, and NFT metadata to generate reliable appraisals. Using the algorithms, Upshot reprices 270K+ top NFT items including Bored Apes, Art Blocks and CryptoPunks every hour.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ri3-203yGo4Fw2jSX73hi.png?height=502&width=764)\n\nSince ML-driven algorithms require a large amount of data points to arrive at computational results, it’s more meaningful for NFT collections with rich historical sales data, rarity stats and traits, and lower volatility. Investors may find it inaccurate for newly minted NFT projects that have less comparable traits in the market.\n\n**(d) Peer-based appraisals** include both mechanisms of 1) manual voting/recommendation and 2) behavior analysis and prediction. It’s hard to compute quantitative results for NFTs that are more subjectively priced like digital arts and thus collective judgment is probably a more reliable type of appraisal for such types.\n\nThe above-mentioned project, Upshot, also has its own NFT appraisal protocol that has established a set of data by incentivizing users to provide honest feedback and recommendations for NFT projects. It has built out the API for developers to integrate their data into various projects.\n\n#### (3) Decentralized NFT trading protocols\n\nOpenSea has announced in mid-June to migrate to Seaport Protocol, an open-source web3 marketplace protocol designed for safely and efficiently trading NFTs. OpenSea has moved one step ahead of its centralized DeFi peers by launching the protocol that features \\~35% lower gas fees, discloses on-chain transactions transparently and allows for forking by other developers.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/66x-rasPvYHxPzw_73sy4.png?height=637&width=1456)\n\nThis move lowers the threshold for developers to build their own NFT marketplaces and moves transaction data on-chain. It may remove the pain points of many existing NFT tooling platforms as they can build their own marketplaces on top of Seaport Protocol, capturing value off their existing user base who normally come to find alphas and then switch to other marketplaces/aggregators for execution.\n\nHowever, given the novelty of this protocol, whether it can actually create a liquidity network effect among the NFT tooling platforms is yet to be examined. One thing is for sure, we look to see more development in the space of permissionless NFT trading protocols.\n\n#### (4) NFT fractionalization \n\nNFT fractionalization means splitting a given NFT into multiple pieces which can be individually traded in the market. The process involves a s smart contract that divides ERC-721 tokens into a number of F-NFTs or fungible ERC-20 tokens. Since these ERC-20 tokens can be tapped into DeFi systems and valued by the market via yield farming on AMMs, it can hugely improve the price discovery and liquidity. Another more apparent reason is it encourages decentralization and democratization by allowing normal investors to gain exposure to otherwise high-value NFT items.\n\n![The splitting of a CryptoPunk NFT into 100 ERC-20 tokens](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ms6mLS4JpzGlC9uB0RAq-.png?height=282&width=600)\n\nOne of the most notable projects in this realm is fractional.art.

F-NFTs may give rise to regulatory issues as they are likely treated as unauthorized ICOs. SEC’s commissioner Hester Peirce warned in 2021 that F-NFTs may be considered to be securities.

To resolve the liquidity issues derived from this behavior, 3 main measures mirrored from existing traditional finance world are aiming to serve these long-term NFT investors: 1) NFT-backed loans/ Collateralized Loan Positions (CDPs), 2) NFT liquidity pools and 3) NFT renting/lending.\n\nBoth of them provide passive income streams and improve capital efficiency for NFT investors while supplying extra liquidity to the market.

Liquidity providers can enjoy faster time-to-liquidity by depositing NFTs, minting corresponding fungible tokens and swapping them easily via DeFi AMMs (e.g. Sushiswap if using NFTX). Apart from NFTX, another key platform is [NFT20](https://nft20.io/). As liquidity pools involve the minting of fungible tokens, this types of services is often times powered by NFT fractionalization protocols.\n\nSame as DeFi, users can arbitrage out an NFT if it’s mispriced and hence facilitate the price discovery. Additionally, liquidity providers usually get LP tokens and can stake them for boosted rewards. Given NFT’s higher volatility and speculation, however, the risk of slippage may be a challenge for both platforms and investors to handle.\n\n### (3) NFT renting \n\nRenting provides another direction for NFT owners to generate passive income. Double Protocol’s ERC-4907 standard has just become the 30th official ERC standard on Ethereum, which takes an innovative approach by adding an ‘expires’ feature that authorizes automatic expiration for the ‘user’. In this way, projects that are built upon ERC-4907 standard can easily segregate users’ ownership from the right of use that will automatically cease upon the end of the renting period. This will fuel up the development of NFT renting and give rise to more derivatives built around it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/za6apYezbkD4dgOQkMS8X.png?height=675&width=1200)\n\nNFT renting can be applicable to a variety of use cases including gaming, art, PFP, membership NFTs and so on. For example, art exhibitions, brands or events may rent out specific digital art NFTs that match with their pop-up shows/events. Or someone who want to join a community for a period of time before making a long-term commitment may rent out a membership NFT for one month (sounds like subscription to paid contents).\n\nThe most promising use case for NFT renting is gaming given the imagination of the size of metaverse. Virtual lands may drive up some hypes as many owners invested in a large amount of lands so that they can count on them to generate passive rental income from different types of uses as the game onboards more users and brands. Furthermore, in-game assets such as skins, gears,  pets, characters and other items are either required to play the game or granting advantages to players. You may find an example from my [article](https://cmsdaisy.medium.com/will-defi-kingdoms-be-the-mega-blockchain-game-in-the-long-term-ddab85d4a650) about how players rent out the Hero characters in the game. In cases where players can’t afford or simply don’t want to buy in-game NFTs due of all sorts of reasons, they will opt for renting, boosting NFT liquidity further.\n\n## IV. Other Thoughts for NFT Liquidity Solutions\n\nWhen it comes to NFT trading, what can drive liquidity further seems to come from communities where users are aligned on tastes and values for the NFT projects that grow out of the community. Often times, the marketplace is a vertical one which is decided by the theme / vibe of the community behind. Such an NFT marketplace is great for NFT projects to exert the tokens’ influence and utilities among community members. Project owners will also have this sense of belongingness and ownership as they can take part in the voting of marketplace design to deliver certain user experience. \n\nDAOs sound like an organic place for such a marketplace to develop especially with the aforementioned Seaport Protocol that lowers the threshold of developing. Additionally, centralized NFT marketplaces are also actively exploring the community features, such as [Coinbase’s beta version](https://nft.coinbase.com/) of its NFT marketplace has a focus on creating a social community for both buyers and sellers.\n\n## V. Closing Thoughts\n\nAll the above liquidity solutions are trying to resolve issues based on the current NFT market size. What drives NFT liquidity fundamentally in the long term will have to come from its own penetration in various industries. \n\nWe are on an exciting journey into the future of NFTs, where we’ve seen prestigious businesses and celebrities from sports, fashion brands, music streaming services and education forming their partnerships with metaverse-like projects and blockchain technologies. The ultimate way to boost the NFT liquidity is through mass adoption. Along the journey of NFT financialization and further adoption, NFT trading platforms are likely to be made subject to more stringent regulations regarding anti-money laundering and security investments.\n\nFasten your seat belt and stay tuned.", "timestamp": 1658146281, "digest": "mEb-WR_p-i-rh-mJrsnMEc8AlUIcR0zgBv4tAGLncYw", "contributor": "0x520E805E3C91c5A047C67e589476884587978Fd1"}

\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9EbW9kSNtG7Fb9m-pawHd.png?height=383&width=900)\n\nArianna Simpson 是科技、游戏和加密货币顶尖风投公司a16z(全称：Andreessen Horowitz)的普通合伙人，她参与投资了各种加密货币和游戏公司，包括Irreverent Labs。她相信区块链技术带来的去中心化的力量，也相信这将引领我们走向元宇宙。\n\na16z拥有6亿美元的专门游戏基金和45亿美元的加密货币基金。Simpson 正在部署这笔资金，但我们也正处于加密货币的低迷时期，以及面临着硬核玩家对NFT的抵制。这让这家公司的风险比几个月前要大得多。在接受GamesBeat的采访时，Simpson 表示a16z准备从长远角度看待这个市场。\n\nGameBeat对Simpson进行了深度专访，探讨了加密货币和游戏的交叉点，她对接受NFT的玩家的看法，为什么玩家应该分享游戏收益，以及为什么a16z的创始人Marc Andreessen和Ben Horowitz看到了这个领域的机会，并向这个领域的特定基金投入了双倍的资金。尽管市场经历了多次过山车式的循环，但这种信念并未改变。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8UskTLlP-s2RPwvcZsc5k.png?height=921&width=640)\n\n*采访对象：顶尖风投公司a16z的普通合伙人 Arianna Simpson \n *以下是此次访谈的文字内容。 \n 提问：你是什么时候开始对这个领域感兴趣的？你是如何发现加密货币和游戏之间的联系的?\n\nSimpson：大约十年前，我掉进了加密货币的兔子洞。我第一次感兴趣是在2013年，当时我在非洲南部旅行。我在六个国家待过一段时间，包括津巴布韦。我目睹了他们经历的恶性通货膨胀的后果。显然，这破坏了经济，迫使他们转向美元以稳定经济。这迫使他们采取激进的措施。\n\n当我回到美国时，我和一个朋友谈到了这个问题，他提到比特币是通货紧缩的，而不是可能过度膨胀的东西。这让我走了很远的路。显然，现在的比特币市场已经远远超出了比特币的范畴。但这只是最初的催化剂。我越深入，就越觉得有趣。这是一个非常丰富的设计空间，汇集了很多领域，从密码学到博弈论到计算机科学等等。\n\n游戏领域是我的基金的核心内容之一。在我加入a16z之前，我创办了一家名为Autonomous Partners的基金。我已经对游戏领域非常感兴趣了。我在这一领域进行了许多投资，包括Mythical和Flow区块链。我联系了Dapper实验室的团队。他们将NFT理念作为游戏体验的一部分，这是值得称赞的，当然，许多其他团队也采用并扩展了这一理念。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m1Xf9tv__KZJo6lasaGIs.png?height=511&width=1080)\n\n我已经深入研究NFT和游戏领域很长时间。看到它们真正开始吸引主流关注，真是令人难以置信。这是2021年的现象。我很期待我们接下来的发展。事实上，我们还只是触及了表面。我们认为web3游戏是一种巨大的催化剂，能够将数千万乃至数亿人带入web3领域。Web3游戏完全可以这样。游戏环境通常会引领技术的发展趋势。我们已经见过很多次了。能够让人们在一个低风险的环境中参与进来，并教育他们为了在这个生态系统中茁壮成长而需要学习的原则，这是非常令人兴奋的。我仍然对这一领域的未来充满期待。\n\n*加密货币价格暴跌*\n\n提问：我知道a16z也有早期的加密货币投资背景，但在某种程度上，像这样一家大型风险投资公司会进入加密货币这样的领域，你会感到惊讶吗？他们是如何推断出这是应该关注的事情的?\n\nSimpson：这家公司，尤其是Mark (Andreessen)和Ben (Horowitz)，值得高度赞扬，因为他们愿意承担在当时看来非常巨大的风险，完全投入到这个领域。在那个时候大多数风投同行都没有这么做。我想加入a16z的原因之一是，这个公司愿意建立专门的独立基金，果断押注自己认定的领域。我并不是在找工作，但这确实让他们比大多数风投同行更突出。\n\n我认为，这家公司多年来对这个领域的信心在大型风投平台中是独一无二的。这让我们能够与最好的创始人合作。创始人希望知道他们的投资者对这个领域有信心。他们不会因为某一天市场的变化而在某一领域中徘徊。Mark、Ben和Chris很早就看到了。这就是我想加入并成为其中一员的原因。\n\n提问：就它最初的吸引力而言，是围绕去中心化的争论，还是其他事情，吸引你们去投资新的想法？\n\nSimpson：在我们的行业中，某种程度上，我们是被动的。我们必须关注伟大的企业家的发展方向。即使在早期，也需要这样。Coinbase的Brian Armstrong，以及其他很多人。即便如此，虽然这是一个很新颖的领域，但你有非常优秀的创始人，他们对这项技术非常感兴趣。同样，我们的投资雷达在某种程度上是受论文驱动的，但也非常受人才驱动。创始人、顶级创始人，在选择加密领域时，我们一直认为这是需要考虑的关键问题。 \n\n提问：你是否经历了两次加密货币寒冬？你经历了多少个寒冬，就加密货币的整体发展而言，你如何看待它们?\n\nSimpson：**周期的长度肯定会随着时间的推移而增加。**早在2013年，一年之内就出现了多个周期。然后，时间轴向外延伸。最重要的一点是专注于技术，而不是过于关注周期。我们已经看到，许多最好的企业——在更广泛的技术领域和加密或具体的web3领域都是如此——都是在市场不稳定时期开始的。我们认为这是一个专注于技术的机会。加密货币面临的挑战之一是有一个报价器，这是早期初创公司所没有的。这会让人分心。但在现实中，在价格活动减弱的时期，可能是专注于建设的绝佳机会。\n\n如果我把我们现在的状况与2018年的衰退相比，就实际建造的东西而言，我们处于一个完全不同的世界。在2018年，很多事情正在进行中，很多Layer 1区块链正在建设，很多基础设施正在建设，远远超过应用程序。基础设施必须放在第一位。在这个领域中，一个人能做的事情还不多。今日不同往日，许多协议已经启动。成百上千的应用程序已经实时可用。游戏，钱包，各种各样的东西。在我看来，这才是最重要的进步。我们已经看到了巨大的进步。\n\n我们还发布了一份加密货币报告，你可能已经看到了。我们用数据绘制出了这个周期的各个部分。虽然它们看起来像是混乱的波动周期，但实际上它们是非常可预测的。周期的每个部分都有其特定的作用，尤其是价格上行的时期吸引人们进入这个领域。热情的投资者蜂拥而至。当潮水退去时，一些人离开了，但他们可能不是建造者。他们可能是投机者。许多核心人才留在了这个领域。这让我们能够为下一波建设做好准备，最终随着创造更多价值，价格会升值。但是周期非常重要。最重要的是专注于技术的开发，显然，这不是一朝一夕就能实现的。\n\n![区块链游戏中的数字土地销售：加密货币寒冬已经开始影响价格升值](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V2Id1WTcP-qQNLkq05UGh.png?height=669&width=1080)\n\n提问：很有趣的是，你可以看到你对即将进入这个领域的开发者有信心。他们要么有加密的背景，要么有游戏的背景。这是值得赌一把的好东西。如果这个领域有什么不确定的地方，这些伟大的团队，经验丰富的人才，似乎值得我们押注。游戏领域的人意识到这是他们想要进入的领域，你是什么时候开始看到这种情况发生的？\n\nSimpson：这波浪潮在2021年真正升温。在此之前，已经有一些来自传统游戏背景的创始人对NFT和web3游戏表示了兴趣。但就真正开始达到临界量而言，是2021年初。我们已经看到它从哪里开始回升。绘制人才迁移的地图是非常令人兴奋的。虽然还不是游戏产业中的所有人，但表示有兴趣或已经积极在游戏中构建Web3组件的创始人的比例显著增加。再次强调，我们认为这是一个值得关注的重要趋势。从那以后，我们一直在投资这些团队。\n\n提问：我认为这将给其他行业带来压力，这很有趣。大公司的首席执行官们面临着压力，他们会说:“不要离开，我们也会探索这个领域。”当我在动视暴雪采访Bobby Kotick时，他表示他们将公司出售给微软的原因之一是他们很难找到人才，留住人才，并为他们承诺制作的游戏雇佣数千名所需人员。有趣的是，这种特殊的区块链游戏趋势可能会卷土重来，并影响主流游戏。\n\nSimpson：是的。我们认为整个游戏理念将对传统游戏实体产生重大影响，无论是发行商还是大型游戏开发商。在这一点上，秘密已经泄露了。我们认为玩家应该抓住他们创造的一些价值。虽然这些模型还需要进行一些迭代，我们还没有达到完美的架构，但核心理念，即创造了这些世界和社区并创造了这么多价值的玩家应该分享这些价值，我们认为这是一个非常重要的理念。\n\n现在，随着玩家越来越熟悉这一事实，这是一种新的模式，我们认为这将给游戏世界中更传统的实体带来巨大的压力，使其采用更有利的模式。它们不会都有相同的模型。这可以有很多形式。但这个核心理念是至关重要的。\n\n提问：我现在感到困惑和疑惑的一个领域是，谁是游戏玩家？在整个2021年，我一直在想区块链游戏将成为元宇宙的垫脚石。你可以将所有这些技术用于资产的身份和互操作性，这些都是创建元宇宙的必要成分。但在12月，我们遇到了玩家反对育碧在《彩虹六号》中的NFT的问题。他们也开始反对其他面向传统玩家的NFT游戏。\n\n那么，谁喜欢NFT，谁讨厌它们呢？亚洲人似乎接受了某些市场的实验，就像他们在免费游戏中所做的一样，而西方的传统玩家和硬核玩家却觉得免费游戏背叛了他们。他们觉得战利品箱就是其中的全部内容。我观察了整个市场，发现免费游戏占据了游戏市场的一半以上。它渗透到游戏的每一个环节，从手机到主机，我们的玩家数量是过去的10倍。对我来说，这些都是好东西。但对于这部分人来说，他们认为免费游戏和区块链游戏是邪恶的东西。\n\n奇怪的是，菲律宾人首先接受了“边玩赚边”的游戏模式。我不知道喜欢这种游戏的玩家和不喜欢这种游戏的玩家谁的占比更高。但我可以看出，如果现在的玩家具有接受它的主流特征，那么NFT游戏成为主流只是时间问题。但如果这些游戏玩家有一些怪癖的话——他们是想通过把钱投入NFT来避税的加密狂人——这里有一些特定的行为是一个小群体的，而不是主流的——也许它永远不会成为主流。如果只是那些在虚拟世界中花1万美元购买一块土地的人，那么这种活动就不会成为主流。\n\n也就是说，你认为现在的受众对这个感兴趣的是什么？什么样的受众可以起飞，并成长为数百万甚至数千万NFT游戏用户？\n\nSimpson： 你提出了一个很好的观点，即**新形式元素**，新模式通常不会被硬核游戏社区所接受。正如你所指出的，这方面有很多先例。但这并没有阻止某些模式获得更大的规模，例如免费游戏。我认为这列火车正驶向车站，它不会真的在这里停下来。\n\n有一群人非常直言不讳地表达了对NFT的保留意见，在很多情况下，他们的批评都是毫无根据的。他们要么没有完全理解这些问题，要么只是用一种非常偏斜的视角来看待问题。但他们只是少数。有很多人已经开始看到这种模式的好处并拥抱它。我不认为这是一个只有非常神秘的原住民的小宇宙。事实上，Axie Infinity是最先成为主流游戏的Web3游戏。它们吸引了数百万玩家。这不仅仅是几个加密货币内部人士。他们拥有巨大的规模，而且他们的大多数玩家都是加密货币的新手。 \n\n这表明，虽然我们还有很大的发展空间，但我们的方向是正确的。游戏是将人们带入这个领域的工具，而不是仅仅吸引一小部分人的自我参照。当然也有讨厌Web3的人，但我认为最重要的是，有数百万人已经表现出对Web3游戏的强烈兴趣。这是我们的重点，也是我们的投资组合公司的重点。\n\n提问：讨论中有趣的部分是，一些游戏开发者继续抵制。他们的论点有时更具技术性。每个人都说这是关于去中心化的，但为什么这里涉及这么多中心化的实体，比如OpenSea？如果OpenSea倒闭，90%的NFT将变得毫无价值。如果你与游戏开发者进行此类讨论，并且需要说服他们，那么这种讨论将如何进行？\n\nSimpson：**我们接触到的大多数创始人都对Web3感到兴奋。**显然，我是加密团队的一员，所以在他们找到我之前，会有一种过滤器。但总的来说，我们已经看到了对这种新模式非常开放的思想和尝试的意愿。游戏是测试新技术和迭代的理想场所，尽管玩家社区的某些子部门可能更不愿意改变。许多之前制作过游戏的Web 2.0创始人都看到了这里的潜力，这也是他们进入这个领域的原因。\n\n我曾与许多在加入web3之前创造过大型游戏的创始人进行过交谈，现在他们会说:“这是最明显的答案。我想不出别的了。这很有意义。这解决了很多问题。”拥有拥有自己的资产的能力—-虽然如果OpenSea消失了，这可能会短暂地影响市场，但事实上我仍然控制着我的剑或我所拥有的任何NFT资产，不管发生什么，因为我拥有链上的钥匙，这是一个重要的转变。许多精明的游戏创始人都明白这一点。这是他们进入这个领域的原因之一。\n\n提问：至于那些可能超出企业家控制范围的事情，比如美国的监管，或允许或不允许的事情，无论是被归类为证券或赌博，还是公司只是不想放弃他们的一些收入流——你认为我们会到达一个比现在更自由的区块链游戏公司的市场吗?\n\nSimpson：当然还有一些监管的灰色地带。在我们的创始人身上，我们看到他们想要合规。他们在寻找可以遵循的明确规则。这就是为什么我们建立了一个庞大的监管团队，与政策制定者合作，帮助他们跟上进度。我们整天都在思考这个领域。他们有许多考虑。只是帮助他们思考这个领域的细微差别。Web3游戏不需要像DeFi协议或其他完全属于这个领域的东西那样的规则。我们要找的是细致入微的监管，做出适当的区分，并适用于他们试图监管的事情。\n\n在我们看来，**监管至关重要。**我们欢迎监管。从消费者保护的角度来看，这是非常重要的。但它需要有意义。这就是为什么我们建立了一个庞大的团队，并花费大量时间在华盛顿特区与监管机构和政策制定者就这些问题进行合作。\n\n提问：我不知道你是否同意这一观点，但我想知道大型游戏公司是否会在这个市场上处于劣势。这与他们的公众地位有关。他们担心规章制度。他们会等待明确的信号，然后才会迅速行动。然而，有些初创公司的价值正在迅速上升，以至于它们将超越大型游戏公司。大型公司通常的解决方案是，谁赢就收购谁。但在手机游戏领域，像Supercell这样的开发商几乎大到无人问津。腾讯几乎是唯一的可能。但手机游戏市场的赢家并不是像Electronic Arts这样的公司。那些能够快速行动且不担心监管的初创公司才是免费游戏的赢家。在我看来，我们现在在区块链游戏中也有同样的机会。\n\nSimpson：肯定是的。正如你所描述的，我们投资了很多这样的初创公司。我们认为他们从第一天起就有能力理解这项技术。它们是加密原生的，web3原生的。他们看到了这个领域可以带来的积极因素。而且，我认为这是一个重要的概念，不仅仅是把一个可能存在于链外的游戏放在一个区块链上。相反，应该利用区块链架构提供的特殊设计约束和机会，作为设计不同玩法形式的新画布。\n\n例如，链上游戏领域是一个非常新的领域，但非常令人兴奋，因为它真的——我的意思是，这是一个游戏世界，你可以在链上战斗，而不仅仅是拥有链上资产。你将区块链整合到游戏玩法中。逻辑是链上的。智能合约是架构的关键部分。所有这些都结合在一起，所以你无法创造出与链下游戏相同的游戏类型。但你可以拥有一种全新的、非常引人注目的体验，它明显是web3原生和加密原生的。我们认为这一类别将推动web3游戏的发展，但我希望我们很快就能看到更多此类内容的出现。\n\n提问：你认为区块链游戏公司的技术储备会变得更简单吗？现在它看起来仍然很复杂。他们有很多选择来选择使用哪条链以及其他东西。你认为这部分会很快变得简单吗？还是说web3将成为一套从根本上更复杂的技术?\n\nSimpson：为了游戏创始人，我希望它能很快变得更简单。你说得对，我们看到想要开发游戏的创始人需要做出很多决定，比如在哪里开发游戏。在某些情况下，这也会影响他们如何设计真正的游戏。例如，Irreverent Labs选择在Solana上进行开发。这伴随着一系列特定的决定。我们也是Mysten Labs的投资者，我认为该公司在游戏和娱乐方面的架构非常出色。它为这种用例设计了一个非常不同的编程模型。\n\n好消息是，创始人拥有越来越多强大的、技术上合理的选择。毫无疑问，我们还有很多工作要做。我们仍然处于基础设施建设阶段。但只要有新的技术领域出现，情况就会是这样。需要构建工具。基础设施的轨道需要变稳固。它需要经过实战检验。在这方面，它正在发生。只是需要一点时间。\n\n提问：通过去中心化，这也有机会改变游戏和大型科技公司之间的关系，这些公司是游戏行业的中间商，他们一直在分一杯羹。这方面的机会有多吸引人?\n\nSimpson：绝对很吸引人。**能够掌控自己的命运是非常重要的，也是非常吸引人的。**\n\n提问：你是否认为除了区块链还有元宇宙都是游戏的赢家，而不是其他类型的群体？无论是大型科技公司、企业还是品牌。\n\nSimpson：我觉得你提到的这些类别有很多重叠的地方。它们并不完全相同，但在边缘有重叠。我们认为一些相同的重要支柱是这些概念的核心。我们最近发表了一篇关于我们认为是元宇宙的七个基本要素的文章。像开放和去中心化这样的事情对我们认为的元宇宙的最终状态很重要。显然，有些人试图推出封闭的元宇宙，但我们认为机会在于开放的元宇宙。\n\n同样地，人们也在以更传统的形式发行封闭生态系统的游戏。我们在Web3游戏中看到了机会，它是开放的，并给予玩游戏的社区更多所有权。肯定有一些相似之处，也有一些重叠之处。在某些情况下，你会看到游戏生活在元宇宙中。界限有点模糊了。但现在它们都是实验性的，非常令人兴奋的领域，它们正在推动前沿。\n\n我认为web3组件在元宇宙和web3游戏中都是重要的元素。我的意思是，代币作为所有权的一部分，持久的数字身份，去中心化，所有这些对Web3来说非常重要的概念。这些元素在元宇宙和游戏环境中都是不可或缺的。这就是一些相似和重叠的地方。\n\n提问：如果存在Web3的支持者和反对者之间的战争，那么决定性的因素可能是我们拥有多少优秀的游戏开发者加入并取得巨大成功的例子。我想到了像Mythical 或Forte这样的公司。Paul Bettner的公司，Wildcard Alliance。他们都非常专注于制作具有NFT功能的硬核游戏。但我也会回想起免费游戏的赢家，并不是把《侠盗猎车手》放到手机平台上。而是Supercell。对比一下Axie Infinity的开发者和制作硬核游戏并将其引进的开发者，你认为谁最值得关注?\n\nSimpson： 我们既投资了web3原生平台，也投资了新进入游戏领域的创始人，以及在传统游戏领域拥有悠久历史的创始人。我觉得这不是一个人对另一个人的问题。**我们寻找的是那些能够理解如何创造出一款优秀游戏，并且能够理解Web3技术并能够看到机遇和限制的人。**这就得到了我之前描述的东西。这是一个不同的设计空间。这意味着，在某些方面，它可以更好，而在其他方面，它可以更具挑战性。我们没有优先考虑一种类型的创始人或一种模式。相反地，我们正在寻找创造出优秀游戏的关键见解，并支持那些我们认为能够创造出优秀游戏体验的顶级团队。\n\n提问：你们是否在公司的不同部门都有专业知识，或者你们都变得更加多学科，学习一些关于元宇宙、加密货币和区块链的知识?\n\nSimpson：我们都是加密和web3的通才，尽管我们中的一些人倾向于专注于某些领域。我更关注于应用层，消费者元宇宙，Web3，游戏等等。如果有一项投资与此相关——例如，Mysten Labs，一个拥有大量主要面向应用层游戏技术的出色团队，以及其他我花了大量时间研究的公司——在这种情况下，它可能是基础设施投资，但它仍然支持这个类别。\n\n提问：我想很多人会希望我问你，我们什么时候才能摆脱这个加密货币的冬天，但我不知道这对你的计划是否重要。\n\nSimpson：**我们需要从长远的角度来看待这个市场。**在这个领域待了一段时间后，我们看到了周期的来来去去。在现实中，它们很难预测。我的工作是寻找伟大的技术专家，帮助他们建立自己的业务，而不是做短期预测。不幸的是，我在这方面帮不上什么忙。但好消息是，我们最近公布了45亿美元的基金。这说明了我们在这里看到的机会的规模，以及我们对这一领域的未来感到非常兴奋的事实。\n\n提问：你今天还有什么想评论的吗?\n\nSimpson：我们认为web3游戏是最令人兴奋的领域之一。看到游戏把人类带进Web领域真的太神奇了。我曾与许多人交谈，他们说:“哦，我最初接触加密货币是因为我开始玩Axie Infinity。”这是让人们了解这项技术及其功能的重要方式。我很期待看到这个领域的其他成就。\n\n \n

{"id": "VuQfMcffvYM-vgXjNgcgA9qucNFDCaL4QGGcri_xZNw", "title": "比特币怎么买卖-买比特币违法么", "body": "比特币可以说是世界上第一个基于区块链技术创建的去中心化的加密货币，比特币是在2008年由中本聪发明的，距今已经有11年的时间了，近些年来，比特币的出圈让越来越多的人们开始了解到了加密数字货币的市场，而比特币也成为了这一市场中当之无愧的龙头。相信现在很多投资者手中都持有比特币，不过对于一些币圈新手来说，他们想要投资比特币，但是还不知道现在比特币怎么买？接下来就让币圈子小编为大家带来BTC比特币买入和交易教程图解。\n\n## BTC比特币买入和交易教程图解\n\n1\\.打开币安交易所官网，您可以直接点击下方链接进入（注意要先开vpn注意避开美国地区的）\n\n[https://accounts.binance.com/zh-TW/register?ref=RXKE7LXW](https://accounts.binance.com/zh-TW/register?ref=RXKE7LXW)\n\n官网，根据下方提示依次选择【使用手机号或邮箱注册】--【台湾】--【邮箱】(推荐QQ、网易163、搜狐邮箱)填写邮箱、密码，点击【注册】\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LFZHPq9GBixMq-xY6b54D.png?height=1094&width=1348)\n\n2\\.注册之后需要进行身份验证，您可以通过【用户中心】-【身份认证】进行身份认证，在该页面可以查看当前认证级别，它决定了您的账户在币安的交易限额。如需提升额度，请依次完成各个级别的身份认证。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vbr7j5lrgVCzVPwpn6gOj.png?height=547&width=2048)\n\n3\\.完成身份验证之后，在首页点击【一键买币】进入交易页面\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FtUZ4YmY2PsiK64uMS1iK.png?height=685&width=1548)\n\n4\\.然后选择【自选区】，根据需求选择合适的商家，点击【购买USDT】。根据弹窗提示向卖家付款，点击“我已付款”等待卖家放币即可。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/idyp0VGh9CH6A6iGRG8r6.png?height=787&width=1534)\n\n5\\.点击行情进入币种页面，搜索比特币英文简称BTC。\n\n6\\.点击BTC/USDT交易对，进入购买页面\n\n7\\.填写购买数量，点击买入，若是卖出，填写卖出数量，点击卖出即可。\n\n## 比特币前景如何？\n\n投资者问比特币今后走势到底会怎么样？首先我们一定要认清这个市场的投资者构成。目前这个市场投资者主要是大资本的市场，就是像马斯克这类世界富豪，大资本进入到了加密数字货币市场。在这样一个情况下，比特币价格今后它跌也不会跌到哪里去，如果比特币暴跌，大资本就会被套牢，他们一定会靠资本实力左右市场走势，但大涨也有局限性。\n\n因为现在全球央行包括监管部门对比特币越来越趋向于加强监管，防止比特币过度投机炒作，特别是防止比特币逃避各个国家的外汇管制，进行洗钱，跨境转移资产，把钱洗白，防止比特币充当这种手段，所以说在这种情况下，大资本不断进入要托盘；监管部门不断给比特币泼冷水让他冷静下来，比特币价格可能会大跌，大跌以后可能会报复性反弹；报复性反弹，又遇到监管强力监管，又会大跌，又会报复性反弹。\n\n一般投资者能不能投资比特币？我是坚决反对，特别在中国。如果央行把出入金这个渠道卡死，包括你线下交易卡死的话，首先，你在监管政策过程就面临着很大的一个风险。我不知道现在已经在线下交易这一块，我们叫线下市场这一块，出入金现在是否正常？你以前进到这个账户里的资金，现在取出来会是个怎么样？持有比特币的，想把它卖掉变现能不能变现，现在都有疑问。这一块风险比较大，所以中国现在基本上对比特币在监管上会越来越趋紧。\n\n投资者在中国投资比特币，首先考虑到是否违法违规，第二个就是我说的这个监管政策，这种风险一定要考虑。\n\n本质上来说，比特币不是这种工薪阶层，这种小资本投资的市场，在那里一夜暴富觉得很难，因为他是大资本的市场，目前这种行情基本上就是可以说是大资本在左右着。这样的话，小资本进去以后，成为虾米被大鱼大资本吃掉可能性很大。这里提醒投资者一定要注意。\n\n另外一个就是我们说加密数字货币，她是完全以区块链为技术，是个去中心化分布式账本和全员信用背书的，它的生命力就在这个地方。所以中本聪设计之初，比特币实质上是为了防止主权货币过度贬值，无形中掠过老百姓的财富，实质上它是冲着国际货币-美元去的。如果沿着这个目标走下去，我觉得比特币的前景还是有的，并且前景还非常广大。一时半会儿这种加密货币市场还消失不了。我们知道有个大空头叫达里奥，他是桥水基金的一个创始人，董事长，他以前竭力反对比特币，而现在也开始力挺比特币，也准备投资比特币，这个转变当然对投资者应该会有一个启发。", "timestamp": 1658146691, "digest": "T0XBxa23SGpScGCSlJBGi7Nj6kJ2vauL5TUlxyLOaaA", "contributor": "0xeE0974e1f9C1826c4B9389b4f532c1de5bb9F41E"}

{"id": "e_JMj-dw6r2ik3ChzPbBlv3jS9gWmoAdZl4oV6A_V5E", "title": "Test Dao Quick Tips: How to Not Fail at Gnosis-Safe", "body": "### You ever wonder “sweet,  I’m a multi-sig signer”  life is going to be great!  Right??\n\nLife is indeed great as a multi sig signer, (or a multi signatory for the cultured of us).  You get to have a say in what compensation gets to be approved, and sometimes, you get airdrops! We love airdrops!  You can feel that special twinkle of joy in your spirit when you’re voted in as a multi sig, or chosen, or volunteered.\n\nOf course, being a multi signatory comes with its own pains, struggles, and annoyances.  I’ve gathered a few tips based on my own failures as a multi signatory, and maybe, this might help you make your life the sweet joy of multi-signerness that have come to expect.  Lets begin.\n\n### 1. Pay attention to your notifications!\n\nDiscord notifications are awful.  We know they’re awful, and if you’re like me, you’re more than likely to miss 75% of them because you’ve opted to a good nights sleep instead of productivity.  (A good nights sleep is productive, don’t let any crypto bro tell you otherwise).\n\nSometimes, you’re going to see notifications that are something along the lines of “hey fren,  confirm your transaction please!”  \n\nI have come to find out (and yes i probably should have known) that gas fees can make or break a transaction.  Gas fees can also change at any given moment in time.  A delayed transaction (as I’ve suffered plenty of times over the last month)  will cause more problems than they’re worth.  \n\nI’ve suffered quite a few rejections of transactions due to the gas limits changing and getting out of whack after starting a transaction.   Having singers pay attention to their notifications, and signing if they are free, almost always can solve issues leading to transactions needing to be rejected. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A10afCdxWp8xk2vRht_Fa.png?height=328&width=1326)\n\n### 2. Explore the types of apps that could work with Gnosis.\n\nThere are more apps available than [Parcel](https://parcel.money/).  Most people assume that Gnosis only works for paying out contributors during remuneration time, and for not much else.\n\nThe types of apps that work for gnosis are interesting.  From apps that can drain your wallet, to apps that can set up recurring payments for contributors,  there are more options to explore when it comes to Gnosis-Safe compatible apps. There are even apps that can help you with swapping tokens around.\n\nAs long as you keep tip #1 in mind, its important to check out the different types of apps that are available that have Gnosis-Safe compatibility.  Try some swaps (with guidance from your fellow contributors of course) try some invoicing apps, and more.  If you do not see an app that is readily available, use the wallet connect app.\n\nMost importantly,  realize there’s more to the Gnosis-Safe than remuneration occurring monthly. It’s almost exciting to investigate.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LEUpyAJ_L-eJ31NKjXbCp.png?height=594&width=1105)\n\n### 3. Don’t be afraid to bug people to respond to their transactions.  Whether they need to be confirmed or rejected.\n\nBe strong, young grasshopper,  if you need to get the transaction completed, then you need to get the transaction completed.   Reach out to your fellow multi sig signers to get things moving along. \n\nHopefully platforms such as [Den](http://onchainden.com), and others, can help with notifications to take the work off of my back with bothering people.  There can be more time spent testing projects, right? \n\n### 4. Having trouble completing a confirmation via the mobile app?  Before giving up, try completing on the computer instead.\n\nHaving gnosis-safe available on mobile (excuse me, on iPhone) is a convenience, but not always functionable. If you run into an issue with using gnosis on your phone, try using your computer before giving up.  Sometimes, the simple answer, is the best one.\n\n### 5. Name your owners, and name your multi sigs!\n\nFor Test DAO, I somehow inadvertently added a mysterious unknown wallet address to the multi sig.  For days, I couldn’t figure out who this person was.   Clearly an unsafe move, it would have been a better move to figure out the names of who happens to be on the multi sig before I started completing transactions.  \n\nYou can do the same when importing your safe.  Unless you have an ability to memorize numbers (and some people do), its always a pain when you come across multiple safes and you have no idea which safe belongs where?\n\nYour life can be made so much easier by simply naming your safe.  We all need things to be as simple as possible when dealing with paying people, right?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QpR5GO5mok0MwFXcZBKdk.png?height=491&width=410)\n\n### Conclusion - there are always more tips to add, so let me know what you have for us here!\n\nThis is not a definitive list of gnosis tips. Whatever tips you have for gnosis management will be more than welcome to have a place on this list.  Please let us know if you have any more tips!  The story doesn’t end here, its only just begun!\n\nReach out to me on twitter - http://twitter.com/infinitehomie\n\nOr find us in discord: http://discord.gg/thetestdao", "timestamp": 1658148242, "digest": "GR6xgPIKEEwSEm1JOxbRTPpLecIur2SmH0xgWd92Rlk", "contributor": "0x96AC4a8925288b224972A007Ca91C99b46a02d1D"}

Mainly because so many of the jokes in *Robin Hood: Men in Tights* are predicated on anachronisms. But also because an awareness of them can help prevent misunderstandings when they are used. As technology advances, anachronisms are inevitable as we attempt to fold new developments into our everyday language. The classic example is referring to a car as a “horse-less carriage”.\n\nWhen the term wallet is used in the crypto space, it is used anachronistically. The term gets the job done, but often leads to confusion about what exactly a wallet is or does. You may hear of web3 wallets, crypto wallets, bitcoin wallets, or ethereum wallets. When I was coming up, all the cool kids had a Fossil wallet, the long checkbook kind. I am writing an article on web3 and cryptocurrency, so clearly I did not have this kind of wallet. I’m pretty sure mine was Dockers brand. Definitely a trifold.\n\nSo what is this new kind of wallet exactly? A web3 wallet is software that allows you to interact with a blockchain. Remember, the blockchain maintains records. In a typical cryptocurrency setting, these records are records of transactions. A wallet allows you to initiate new transactions or new records on the blockchain. Of course these must be confirmed and validated by the network.\n\n### What’s in Your Wallet?\n\nWeb3 wallets do not hold or contain any cryptocurrency in the way that a traditional wallet would hold dollar bills. This is the main anachronistic misunderstanding that needs to be avoided. What they contain is the software necessary to interact with a blockchain network. They also contain two cryptographic keys. These keys are referred to as a Public Key and a Private key. These two keys are the most important thing contained in a wallet.\n\nThese two keys are the basis of the cryptography that secures the blockchain. The typical analogy used to describe them is a padlock and key. The public key works like an open padlock that you can give to anyone. You keep the private key, which opens the padlock. When they want to send you something, they secure it with the padlock. Once the padlock is secured the only way to open it is by using the Private key, which only you should have.\n\nBoth of these keys are very long and complicated alpha-numeric codes. For example, the public key for my Ethereum wallet is:\n\n*0x14237e3a87BDa9FC4aD65ED2a2c9d43F535f73CF*\n\nThis code represents me on the ethereum blockchain. This is my address or identity. This key is public, so it is safe for anyone to have it. If someone wants to send me something, such as cryptocurrency or an NFT, they would send it to this address. “Sending it” would mean they use their wallet to create a transaction that assigns or records ownership of the item to my address. Now it is under my control. It has been locked with my public key. I can leave it locked or I can unlock it and send it to someone else. In order to unlock it, I would need the other thing inside my wallet - my private key. Private keys must be kept secure. Private keys are used to unlock the cryptocurrency, NFT, or other item and send it to a new address. The person who has the private key is the person who has control over the items associated with the paired public key. If your private key is lost, your ability to access and control any assets associated with your public key address is lost as well. Wallets help you keep up with these keys.\n\nWithin a wallet, you can create and manage multiple Public key / Private key pairs which operate like different accounts.\n\n### Getting a Wallet and Some $Crypto\n\nThe first thing a person has to do to interact with the web3 world is to get a wallet. There are lots of options. Some wallets are designed to work with a single blockchain only, such as a bitcoin wallet. Other wallets, called multi-chain wallets, can interact with multiple blockchains and allow you to manage different types of cryptocurrencies through the same wallet interface. Once someone has a wallet, they can connect to an online exchange to trade their American dollars for cryptocurrency or an NFT. (I know I keep mentioning NFTs without explaining what that is. That will be the next article.) The exchange will then create a new transaction that assigns the agreed upon amount of cryptocurrency to the pubic key address of the wallet. It is now locked with that Public key. Once the transaction is added to the blockchain record, the person “owns” or is in control of that cryptocurrency because they are the only ones who have the Private key to unlock it.\n\nRemember, when this cryptocurrency is “sent” to the new user, nothing is actually sent. This is often a hard concept for people to get their minds around, but an incredibly important one to understand. Instead, the record on the blockchain is updated to show that their address now controls the cryptocurrency they purchased. In this way, they own it. The cryptocurrency is not in their wallet, but rather their wallet contains the Private key that allows them to control the cryptocurrency.\n\n## Types of Wallets\n\nThere are some important distinctions among the types of wallets out there. These distinctions are typically based on a trade off between ease of use and security.\n\n### Hardware wallets are for Hardcore People\n\nThe first type of wallet to consider is a hardware wallet. This is the most secure type of wallet. These typically look like a USB thumb drive. The reason they are so secure is because they can be unplugged from your computer and buried in a coffee can in your yard. Without that device and the Private key it contains, no one is gaining access to your cryptocurrency. The downside is, if you forget where you buried the coffee can you aren’t gaining access to your cryptocurrency either. These are also going to be password protected, so if you lose your password you won’t be able to get into the device to access any cryptocurrency associated with that wallet. There is also the possibility that the device itself could break, leaving you in the lurch without a way to access your cryptocurrency.\n\nWhen you use a hardware wallet, you and you alone are in control of your Private key. Therefore, you and you alone are in control of your cryptocurrency. If something happens to your hardware wallet, there is no tech support to email or call to help you get it back.\n\n### Custodial vs Non-Custodial\n\nMost people are going to use a software based wallet that is accessed through a computer, web browser, or smartphone app. The major distinction between these types of wallets is Custodial vs Non-Custodial.\n\nA Custodial wallet is a wallet that you access through a third party or custodian. These types of wallets are the most user friendly in the sense that if you have any issues or forget your password, there is normally tech support options and the usual password recovery options. The reason they are able to offer so much help is because they hold both the Public and Private key. This is helpful when it comes to ease of use, but it presents a major risk when it comes to security. The reason it presents such a security risk is because you are not actually in control. Instead, you are trusting a third party, which is really antithetical to the entire web3 ideal.\n\nOne of the biggest risks associated with Custodial wallets is for the custodian to go out of business. If you use a Custodial wallet through a company that goes out of business, you will most likely loose access to your wallet and the keys it contains. Without that private key, you cannot control any of what you own. This was a very common issue in the early days of cryptocurrency when companies would pop up and then fail quickly. In fact, there is quite a bit of cryptocurrency sitting on the blockchain, never to be accessed again because someone lost their access to their Private keys when a company went dark.\n\nAnother risk to Custodial wallets is the potential for censorship. If the third party custodian decides for some reason, political or otherwise, that you should not have access to your cryptocurrency, then they can cut you off by removing your access to the Private key controlling your cryptocurrency. \n\nArguably the best happy medium between a hardware wallet and a Custodial wallet is a Non-Custodial wallet. These are sometimes referred to as Self-Custody wallets. These are wallets that only you control, so there is no third party who has access to your keys. These wallets live on your device. These can be desktop applications, web browser extensions, or smartphone apps. The main security risk is that the device they live on will typically be connected to the internet and therefore have the potential to be hacked. Also, the device could be stolen. These wallets are password protected. If you lose your password, there are some limited options for recovering the password. Typically password recovery is through a “seed phrase” which is a long collection of random words that essentially function as a very secure backup password. If you lose your password and your seed phrase, you are toast. It will be very difficult to recover access to your wallet and the Private key it contains.\n\n## That Thing They Keep Saying\n\nIf you wander around the crypto world for very long, you are sure to run into someone saying, “Not your keys, not your coins”. This is a good summary of how to understand wallets and control of cryptocurrency. Wallets contain keys. These keys are used to control the cryptocurrency associated with them. If you don’t have access to the keys because you lost access to your wallet, then you can’t control your coins.\n\nAnother thing people will say is, “I have some bitcoin in my wallet”. This is simply not true. This is an anachronistic understanding of what crypto wallets do. Even when people say they “own” cryptocurrency, this isn’t exactly the case. What they own, or what they are in possession of, is the Private key that allows them to control the coins associated with a particular Public key. This control plays out on the blockchain record where the software contained in a wallet allows the person to create a new record that shows the cryptocurrency is now assigned to a different Public key, which represents the address or identity of a different person. This new person will be the new owner, so long as they have their Private key.\n\n## End Note\n\nSince the last article I published, cryptocurrency prices have tanked. Some people are crying because they lost a bunch of money. Other people are patting themselves on the back for being so shrewd and knowing better than to invest in something as silly as computer money.\n\nNo one should be surprised. It was a bubble and the bubble popped. Many people have been forecasting a so-called Crypto Winter for awhile. Is this it? Maybe. Could things go lower? Maybe.\n\nThis isn’t all bad. (Easy for me to say, I didn’t just lose my shirt.) This will be a chance for web3 applications that are actually good, useful, and solve problems to rise to the top, while less valuable ideas and scams will get left behind. Projects that are inherently valuable will hang around and get better.\n\nI’ll keep writing; you keep reading. If and when you decide to join the web3 world, it won’t be because of hype, but rather because you understand what you are getting into and you see the real value in it.", "timestamp": 1658148862, "digest": "BeYtuWB2KHVJGRFK9XPUHjqA9yXpnad77Mxzw_OMfRk", "contributor": "0x14237e3a87BDa9FC4aD65ED2a2c9d43F535f73CF"}

In a broader sense, *Crisis* is an ongoing multi-media, multi-level experiment that explores alternative ideas for the distribution and exploitation of musical works. It is the journey of an album that defied the dominant structures of its system in order to break new ground.\n\nThis project aims to align *releases* ↔︎ *value* ↔︎ *community* into one common narrative. Read more about the process below.\n\n## Season 00 – The Story\n\nOne year ago the journey of Crisis began with the release of *[Crisis (The Worthless Album)](https://open.spotify.com/album/7nwbv2tj8q9OTWhin3ZBsm).* What had been planned as a traditional release, changed due to a pivotal decision.\n\nThe album was cut into 30 pieces, each 29 seconds long. Since a stream only starts counting after 30 seconds of playtime, it can't collect plays or earn any revenue, no matter how much it's listened to. The value of this album is 0.000$\n\nUltimately, this is the only way to choose one's own value in the current system of being patronised by a pro-rata system (streaming) of big tech and major labels. By releasing an album this way, it reveals quite the imbalance and absurdity of the music industry's current monetisation model and asks if centralised platforms should define the value of art according to a demand-supply calculation. Or, instead, shall creators regain complete control over the value they create.\n\n> \"*Valentin Hansen released an album in a way that’s never been done before. In doing so, he highlighted the unprecedented shift in how music is being made as a direct result of the rule.*\"\n> — Brian Harrington, [The Album That's Worth Nothing](https://deathbyalgorithm.substack.com/p/the-album-thats-worth-nothing)\n\nNo matter how many of the industry tricks we utilised, we ended up in a zero-sum game.\n\n![An exhibition with a click farm.

To put it more simply, we will distribute ownership of *Crisis* during 9+ seasons.\n\nTherefore, the original album was minted as one piece of music on [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/valentinhansen/crisis-the-album-).\n\nOwnership of this NFT will be represented by each season's tokens (editions of NFTs), with 50% of the shares being transferred within the first nine seasons. Additionally, each season represents the album in its current form. As seasonal NFTs are collected, the album starts to change visually, sonically, & experientially until that particular season sells out.\n\nUpon sellout, a new season unlocks, shape- shifting the album once more and unlocking further experiences, products, visuals, etc.\n\nThe remaining 50% will be allocated in season 10.

The following user and comment system is under developing.\n\n## How it works\n\nMetamask browser version support others sending a message that can only be decrypted by the address owner, so Ingang send an encrypted message to you, this message include a key that both sides can use it to encrypt and decrypt, every time user login, this key will renew, so this can make sure that the message received and send is only for the address owner. To send message that can only be decrypted by address owner, I need to get your EncryptionPublicKey use this function , so as your first time login, it will ask you to provide the encryption public key, this is not even your public key of you ETH account.\n\nThe Ingang does not track you any data, all information comes from your Metamask address, you don’t need to worry about traditional privacy problems.\n\nThe current goal of Ingang, to encourage good content producers come to publish valuable information. Every month income from the advertisement will **directly send ETH** to the top producers, the proportion and distribution is still under consideration, but now I think it should be more than 50% of profit every year.\n\nAlso after Ingang grown up ( I hope it could be : ), it can run as Substack or some other profitable business to support it running.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nCurrently, user following function is under development. It should be release soon.\n\nNext step will be upload content to system like Arweave or IPFS, I am still learning how it works and how to implement this.  Since upload content to this kind of system is expensive, which content to be uploaded will be selected by rule, not by people, for example, if user address is new or asset is under 100 USD, it’s content can only send to IPFS 1Mb every week, unless it become top generator once. But all this is still under consideration. This is just a framework I am thinking about, this is a trade off between open security and cost.\n\nAfter this, it should be to do some job as address analysis, the main page content will recommend depends on the user address, this will be a big job.\n\n### (Updated on 26/6/2022)\n\nFollowing system is somehow working now, next is redesign the UI\n\n### (Updated on 12/7/2022)\n\nNew UI deployed, next step is add function of nickname.", "timestamp": 1658149311, "digest": "ukWKrGCEckczZY3EtrO4lAmlTenHfEzDgDCRvKcTxGY", "contributor": "0xC3a21b522F39120290D63A2ad250ca7CB81FAb1F"}

The following user and comment system is under developing.\n\n## How it works\n\nMetamask browser version support others sending a message that can only be decrypted by the address owner, so Ingang send an encrypted message to you, this message include a key that both sides can use it to encrypt and decrypt, every time user login, this key will renew, so this can make sure that the message received and send is only for the address owner. To send message that can only be decrypted by address owner, I need to get your EncryptionPublicKey use this function , so as your first time login, it will ask you to provide the encryption public key, this is not even your public key of you ETH account.\n\nThe Ingang does not track you any data, all information comes from your Metamask address, you don’t need to worry about traditional privacy problems.\n\nThe current goal of Ingang, to encourage good content producers come to publish valuable information. Every month income from the advertisement will **directly send ETH** to the top producers, the proportion and distribution is still under consideration, but now I think it should be more than 50% of profit every year.\n\nAlso after Ingang grown up ( I hope it could be : ), it can run as Substack or some other profitable business to support it running.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nCurrently, user following function is under development. It should be release soon.\n\nNext step will be upload content to system like Arweave or IPFS, I am still learning how it works and how to implement this.  Since upload content to this kind of system is expensive, which content to be uploaded will be selected by rule, not by people, for example, if user address is new or asset is under 100 USD, it’s content can only send to IPFS 1Mb every week, unless it become top generator once. But all this is still under consideration. This is just a framework I am thinking about, this is a trade off between open security and cost.\n\nAfter this, it should be to do some job as address analysis, the main page content will recommend depends on the user address, this will be a big job.\n\n### (Updated on 26/6/2022)\n\nFollowing system is somehow working now, next is redesign the UI\n\n### (Updated on 12/7/2022)\n\nNew UI deployed, next step is add function of nickname.", "timestamp": 1658149278, "digest": "c9m2Ph8FmlFqoPBkRxiFaWQ0EtiMqkb-V-SuT--Pdj4", "contributor": "0xC3a21b522F39120290D63A2ad250ca7CB81FAb1F"}

The solution scales along with the customer’s business. Through Europa’s solution, customers can easily mint tokenized redeemables, offer them to their communities, and deliver the digital assets to customers. This allows customers to focus on their business, rather than the underlying Web3 technology.\n\nEuropa is a proven SaaS solution built by experienced crypto engineers – that makes it simple for brands to enter web3, and tap into the customer engagement, creator monetization, and tokenized incentive structures that makes web3 so appealing to consumers and brands.\n\nE-Commerce is already a dominant, 5.5T dollar industry, and the web3 stack has the potential to disrupt it entirely.\n\nTokenization of physical goods can transform this entire market, just like decentralized finance has disrupted traditional finance, and NFTs have disrupted the traditional art market.  We are building a solution to service this niche at scale.\n\nFor more information about web3 loyalty platforms, visit [europalabs.io](https://europalabs.io)\n\n## About The Graph\n\n[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is the indexing and query layer of web3. Developers build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL.

"原文：<https://dirtroads.substack.com/p/-43-first-principles-of-crypto-governance>\n\n我家的狗Leo，讨厌兽医，一看到路标指向兽医执业的小镇，就狂吠。他讨厌兽医，因为兽医意味着针头和打针。显然，他无法理解为什么针的疼痛实际上可以保护它免受更严重、更痛苦的疾病的侵袭。打针意味着疼痛，疼痛是不好的。然而，他走进推拉门，耳朵朝下，一双湿润的眼睛似乎在要求我父亲：“我知道我们彼此相爱，你为什么要这样对我？”这就是重点：在他所生活的人类难以理解的世界中，Leo 选择相信这样的启发式方法，即由于他的家人似乎总是为他的利益行事，任何请求（甚至是痛苦的请求）都可能是其中的一部分这种充满爱心和关怀的相互协议。狗和人类几千年来一直是朋友，在绝大多数情况下，启发式方法被证明是有用的，因此它得以延续。\n\n在加密去中心化组织的创始人-主人-控制者和社区成员之间普遍存在的仁慈启发式(Heuristic of Benevolence)可能有着类似的起源。你们让我或其他人赚了很多钱，因此我永远不应该怀疑你的纯粹意图。可能是同样的原因，同样的仁义启发式变成了对任何最初没有参与社区建设的人（外来者）的怀疑启发式。\n\n启发式的问题在于它们很容易被欺骗。\n\n**哦，治理，亲爱的最小化者**\n\n上周的 Dirt Roads 讨论了 MakerDAO 最近的治理周期。最后包括三个开放性问题：\n\n基于现有的治理机制和代币分配，我们是否相信 Maker 的审查阻力？\n\n当一群（可以说）一致的各方拥有足够的投票权来超过如此多的机构参与者时，我们是否相信 Maker 是一个真正去中心化的组织？\n\n我们是否认为 Maker 的结构可以有效地处理带来最低程度的复杂性和不透明性的用例（和借款人）？\n\n这三个问题可以总结为一个问题：我们认为加密协议的主导治理框架是否可以（在本地）在处理复杂任务的同时激励善意的行为？我的直觉是，这些问题的答案只是“不”。\n\n对于 Maker，与许多其他加密项目一样，治理任务统一分配给治理代币 $MKR 的持有者。但更普遍的是，$MKR 的持有者可以对协议的更改进行投票——任何人都可以提交提案。提案将按照以下简化的流程进行投票。\n\n争论最有效的角色分配或替代角色机制超出了这篇文章的精神。我们感兴趣的是Maker 治理框架的架构师认识到恶意治理攻击的风险，为了反对它，他们包括了一个治理安全模型，该模型具有延迟特定提案执行的功能——允许 $MKR 持有者收集足够的共识来呼吁紧急关闭，然后有序地解除协议本身。\n\n由 Aragon 和 Optimism 开创的乐观治理学派通过假设所有提案都经过投票来引导这一概念，除非在一定时间内在法庭上受到质疑。这些努力值得称赞，在每个决定的结果是显而易见的、事前可衡量的或立即产生影响的环境中仍然有效。随着 DAO 的雄心壮志超越僵化和明确界定的界限，并朝着通过复杂结构增加现实世界信用等复杂任务，很明显，即使是乐观的挑战窗口也不足以抵御恶意攻击。\n\n不可还原性问题 → 最初，大多数链上治理不得不面对非常简单的决定：是否将 ERC-20 代币列入白名单、增加或减少参数、激活或停用预言机提要。治理机制不断发展以满足这一需求，而区块链技术允许更精细地分离任务。但雄心是人类的特征，协议逐渐扩展到复杂神经节的用例，而不是有序的原子决策集合：我们是否应该开始为现实世界的信贷融资，我们的资金管理策略应该有多活跃，我们应该如何应对我们的流动质押服务对原生链稳定性的影响，我们在复杂的 DeFi 堆栈中的作用等。扩展产生了一个工程师可能还无法完全掌握的不可还原性问题。在对每个可能的案例进行建模以进行决策时，在结构上不可能继续扩展。我们需要学会与无数极端情况共存，这些极端情况会产生任何无法预料的影响。不可还原性的影响可能是灾难性的。\n\n两种可能的解决方案 → 可用的解决方案有两个方向：（i）使治理机制更适合处理无法衡量的不确定性和利益冲突，以及（ii）通过任务和责任的原子化来减少不确定性。尽管从长远来看，第二个（分解、简化、僵化）是我们应该追求的目标，但不确定性不能从根本上消除，因此开发一个更具不确定性的决策框架是我们无法逃避的。\n\n这篇文章的其余部分将致力于问题的初步形式化。当事情变得复杂时，我相信开发一个简化版本的现实是有价值的。我们的想法是使用这样的框架来了解发挥作用的关键力量，并尝试设计在激励良性影响的同时减轻恶性影响的机制。\n\n**乐观治理博弈**\n\n我决定设计游戏。让我澄清一下：由约翰·冯·诺伊曼和奥斯卡·摩根斯坦开创的博弈论和经济行为理论，将数学严谨性作为现代经济学的基础，被加密货币兄弟滥用和误用太久了，我无意加入其中。这些游戏将不是博弈论，而是奇闻趣事数学。像奇闻趣事新闻一样，编写下面描述的一组方程式的目的是提供正在发生的事情的氛围，而不是提供提炼解决方案所需的象征性工具。然而，在协议治理的背景下将人际互动正式化是一项雄心勃勃的任务，我希望这将激发比我拥有更多技能和时间的其他人的兴趣。\n\n我首先构建了一个乐观治理游戏（OGG）。在 OGG 中，所有参与协议治理的人都是好人，并打算将协议本身产生的经济价值最大化——这是一个重要的规范。在这个简化的游戏配置中，我们假设参与者/选民从外部收到一个提案，并且有能力基于任意治理机制（即投票功能）通过或投票。\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/0e5ffd4e735fcc5283b352f893b80e8b.png)\n\n提案i的投票函数V以N个参与者所有投票的向量作为输入。在OGG中，我们可以假设每个参与者都有一票。投票函数的输出为0 (ding)或1 (pass)\n\n只有两种类型的提案：善意的提案和恶意的提案。 善意的提案对所有选民都有积极的影响——因此对协议也有积极影响，而恶意的提案给支持者（位于选民群体之外）带来了巨大的利益，但代价是协议有可能被破坏。\n\n被破坏的预期成本取决于分配的概率函数和每个投票者给协议的值 V。 为简单起见，我们可以假设所有善意的提案都有相同的回报，并且所有选民都为协议分配了相同的价值——并且这个价值远远高于单个通过提案的潜在价值。 由于所有选民都有相似的偏好，并且是治理集之外的支持者，我们可以从协议的角度概括上述功能。\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/ff31ac5fa4619a2da7c450f9bf4f377e.png)\n\n不出所料，我们不能提前说一个提议是善意的还是恶意的。我们需要用概率来思考。我们可以重写一个一般化提议的期望收益函数，如下所示：\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/0e3c92ebd1f93805ca98e1b032f52648.png)\n\n我们也知道，恶意提案的不良影响只会在不确定的时间延迟之后变得明显——而且只是间接地，即通过观察协议的存续情况。 换句话说，如果在 OGG 结束时——即到时间 T，协议仍然完好无损，我们最好的猜测是治理没有通过恶意提案，我们赢得了 OGG。\n\n最后，该协议，即所有投票者的总和，当面临投票赞成或反对广义的第一个提案时，旨在最大化下面的期望值函数。 这个目标是 OGG 的一个假设，因为理论上选民可能被赋予非常不同的目标函数。\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/1759a1456ac84b1bba931710baedbd47.png)\n\n被破坏的概率等于在OGG结束前出现恶性结果的概率\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/b5a10c8ea14fe5d5d9cccf571438ad38.png)\n\n鉴于 OGG 的结构非常简单，大多数结果都是微不足道的。 然而，它们值得反思：\n\n*   支持者有动力去做大→由于协议被破坏事件是核问题，支持者被激励向选民提出也提供高直接利益的提案\n*   看起来不错的主要动机→更高的（可感知的）仁慈密度简化了选民的决策\n*   流动性不足有溢价 → 延迟的提案，或者结果延迟的更好的提案，更容易被决策过程消化\n*   价值最大化并不是生存最大化→期望值最大化的策略可能会导致与协议生存最大化的一个非常不同的最优决策集\n\n**现实的治理游戏**\n\n如果我们为游戏增添一点趣味，事情会变得更有趣。现实，尤其是 DAO 现实，比我们的 OGG 复杂得多。为了我们的讨论，我想重点关注几个关键差异：\n\n*   选民也可以是支持者 → 选民和支持者之间存在部分重叠，无论是善意的还是恶意的提案——因此，我们将使用参与者一词，包括选民和支持者\n*   恶意提案对其支持者非常有利 → 恶意提案的私人（非共同）利益可能会大大超过协议被破坏对其支持者的私人影响\n*   私人和协议的视角不同 → 由于多样化和时间范围不匹配，单个选民/支持者的私人回报函数与协议范围的回报函数显着不同\n\n在现实治理游戏(RGG)中，我们可以重写如下的目标函数，现在区分了好的和坏的支持者。我们假设无论是提议还是投票都没有任何成本。\n\n好的参与者 → 一个有道德的支持者的目标函数与广义的 OGG 案例非常相似。\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/7611b5d89e030665750038de178d6231.png)\n\n然而，正如我们已经暗示的那样，我们现在已经列出了每个单个参与者 n 的预期收益，因为：(i) RGG 中单个参与者的时间范围很可能与协议的时间范围不同——即单个参与者 可能仍会出售他的投票权和离开权，(ii) 鉴于损害分摊和投资组合多样化，RGG 单个参与者的损害很可能不是核损害。 这些差异会增加优秀参与者的风险承受能力； 参与者有动力去“碰碰运气”的提议，这些提议对于议定书来说具有不可忽视的核心机会。\n\n坏参与者 → 然而，坏参与者会发生什么更有趣。 不良参与者是有意识地提出恶意提案，享有该提案的私人利益，并有意识地投赞成票的人。\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/96c2bd948c264dafb0cdf00ab24c8980.png)\n\n不良行为者偏离的动机要高得多：（i）只有潜在的损失（而不是非凡的收益）会相互抵消，（ii）由于恶性结果的可见性更好，损失可以更容易地避免。不良参与者有巨大的动机提出恶意提案并游说好参与者以最大程度地减少对苛刻协议损害的看法。换句话说，对于每个人来说，都有很大的动机去偏离和变成坏参与者。\n\n在这个简化的表示中，偏离的动机与以下因素正相关：\n\n*   可征用性→私人偏差收益的相对大小\n*   相互化 → 社区规模，或参与者总数\n*   不确定性→感知到遇到不良建议的风险\n*   紧迫性 → 恶意影响出现的概率\n*   风险厌恶→令人惊讶的是，风险厌恶激励变成了坏人\n\n然而，系统并不是一成不变的。这意味着更多的恶意行为者将被大型和不确定的社区所吸引，他们的动机如此之高，以至于他们准备投入大量资源来渡过难关。 这会给没有正确制衡的社区造成死亡螺旋。\n\n**接下来是什么**\n\nOGG 和 RGG 都是极其简化的奇闻趣事数学游戏。尽管如此，它们仍然是一个良好的开端，并且可以迫使我们在设计我们的协调机制时照照镜子并超越修辞的个性化。\n\n包括 Maker 在内的一些协议仍然忠于“无结构的暴政” - h/t @Dermot_Oryordan，这是对纯粹主义方法的辩护，在这种方法中，利益中心(代币持有者、借款人、$DAI持有者、核心单位成员、代表、少数族裔、协议)的正规化为了去中心化的利益而遭到抵制。但是，正如乔·弗里曼在她的不朽文章中所说:\n\n“与我们想相信的相反，不存在无结构的群体。任何性质的任何一群人，为了任何目的聚在一起，无论时间长短，都将不可避免地以某种方式构建自己。 \\[…]\n\n这意味着争取一个无结构的群体与瞄准一个“客观的”新故事、“无价值”的社会科学或“自由”经济一样有用，也具有欺骗性。 \\[…] 这个想法成为强者或幸运者的烟幕，以建立对他人的无可置疑的霸权。”\n\n这是否是故意的无关紧要。但是使用我们的简化模型，同质的选民/支持者团体意味着增加不确定性、相互化和潜在的可征用性。对我来说，Maker 的治理设计是一个糟糕的设计，因为它鼓励了逆向选择（借款人之间）和不良行为者的逍遥法外。\n\n然而，加密货币治理也有很好的例子。 6 月 10 日，@skozin 在 Lido 的论坛上发布了一项提议，为流动性 Staking 协议建立 LDO+stETH 双重治理机制。在认识到存在选民（$LDO 持有者）不是那些遭受破坏的人（主要是利益相关者）的代理问题后，支持者提出了一系列与我们在 RGG 中概述的框架一致的想法：\n\n*   通过僵化缩小治理范围→减少不确定性\n*   延迟执行投票提案→减少紧迫性\n*   为 $stETH 引入否决/反否决系统 → 减少相互化\n*   实施（部分）恶意资源销毁→减少可征用性\n\n该提案明确承认不可能事前识别所有潜在的攻击媒介或边缘情况，并转而采用基于第一原则的方法，该方法在承认存在利益冲突的同时，激发了对抗性（且代价高昂）的治理辩论.我会敦促参与设计治理原则的任何人彻底通过该提案。这是一个值得象征性表示的东西。\n\n双重治理体系并不是唯一可行的途径。需要更深入分析的值得一提的是 Pocket Network 的权益工作机制、DXDdao 的基于声誉的投票、声誉和参与衰减机制，以及显然是以太坊的 EIP-5114 灵魂绑定。不确定性密集环境的治理机制的研究和设计空间是广阔而迷人的。我们真的无法在人类交互的脆弱基础层之上构建任何复杂的东西。\n\n选择现成解决方案的极端主义对政客来说是好事。但我们不是政客，我们要留在这里，我们的目标不是在船烧毁之前跳船。除了低头，我们别无选择；学习、研究、测试、迭代和梦想。\n",

{"id": "1_jyYDQyMOSg72UHwVSOy2TlaQof_2aP5qNCH9-wJ5A", "title": "关于NFT的畅想（四）", "body": "NFT如果具备跨场景的通用性，那无疑NFT的生态就会迅速地发展和扩张。但由于缺乏激励，在当下的加密生态中，一个场景中的NFT很难主动被其它场景接纳和包容。那有没有可能反过来一个NFT产生的场景足够强大并强大到囊括其它场景中的NFT，甚至主动被吸引其它场景中的NFT加入到这个生态中呢？\n\n我认为这是有可能的，无聊猿就有正在向这个方向发展的苗头。\n\n始于2021年的那一拨NFT热潮中诞生了多种NFT生态，包括头像类NFT，艺术品NFT，游戏类NFT等等。但毫无疑问，出圈能力最强，影响最大的就是以无聊猿和加密朋克为首的头像类NFT。\n\n无聊猿团队以其强大的运营能力迅速让无聊猿从NFT头像发展成为潮牌，具备了强大的品牌效应。这在由传统IP霸主（比如迪斯尼）垄断的传统IP领域是一个极其罕见的现象。\n\n在无聊猿短短这一年的发展过程中，有两件事给我印象很深：一是无聊猿收购了加密朋克；另一个就是在它计划为其它几个知名的NFT项目制作3D头像，让那些NFT持有者未来能够用它们的NFT畅游无聊猿规划的虚拟场景。\n\n这种做法显然就是希望建设一个“大一统”的NFT场景。\n\n这种做法好是非常好，但它仍然走的是传统中心化的路线：即用自己的生态影响力去收购影响其它品牌。\n\n这种自上而下的运动在我看来缺少了加密生态的原生基因：社区。\n\n但凡在加密生态中崛起并强大的生态几乎都离不开社区的共建和社区的推动。作为诞生于加密生态的无聊猿在最开始就是靠德强大的社区运作成长崛起的，但越走到后面似乎这种味道就越淡。\n\n我始终期待看到一种NFT生态，它是由社区共建来推动和发展起来的。我相信靠这样的方式成长起来的生态才是最有生命力、最有潜力的生态。\n\n一次偶然，我发现了一种基于新型知识产权协议制作的NFT。这种协议被称为CC0。\n\n这个协议和传统的知识产权协议有一个最大的区别，就是它“不保留任何权益”。在这种协议下CC0作品的原作者将放弃所有与作品相关的著作权和邻接权，不再像传统知识产权产品那样通过授权获得商业利益。同时，任何第三方都可以基于CC0作品进行任何开发和创作。\n\n在传统的中心化世界中，我们很熟悉的方法是商业授权。比如迪斯尼开发出了一款卡通形象，它通过授权使用这种卡通形象，允许商家开发衍生产品，比如带这种卡通形象的玩具、衣服等。\n\n在这种模式中，迪斯尼通过授权源源不断地获得商业收入，商家通过使用授权、利用卡通形象的影响力获得收益。但在这种商业模式中，商家需要有相当的资金和运作实力才能获得这种授权并从中获利。这个门槛对商家是相当高的，它将大量资金实力不够的商家排除在了这个授权之外，在某种程度上这扼杀了创造力和想象力。\n\n无聊猿的NFT在知识产权上相对于迪斯尼那种严格的产权协议采取了稍微宽松的协议，但它也仅仅只是允许持有者拥有所有的知识产权。这同样会引起产权纠纷。最近一个颇具争议的NFT项目RP/BAYC在我看来就有这方面的意味。\n\n而更早的加密朋克则更是如此。曾经在朋克社区引起轩然大波的NFT项目CryptoPhunks就是一个围绕朋克头像的知识产权产生纠纷的典型。\n\n早期的我对这些纠纷仅仅只是把它们看作名声和利益之争，但当我看到基于CC0协议的NFT之后，我认为早期的这些纠纷固然涉及到名声和利益之争，但更本质的还是反映了围绕NFT创作存在的一些根本性问题。\n\n这些根本性问题实际上阻碍了NFT由社区进行推动和发展。\n\n而基于CC0协议开发的NFT在我看来，就打开了NFT通过社区进行协作、发展和壮大的大门。它通过表面上的放弃权益为二次创作消除了所有的障碍，将释放NFT创作的无限潜力，激发整个NFT社区的无限想象力。\n\n风险提示：投资有风险，内容只是个人分析，仅供参考，不构成投资建议，或许我说的是错的，所以你要小心。\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Daosview)", "timestamp": 1658151087, "digest": "Yb4t-r6_TTiLSNq7wObblgr_R-2CNtyoaaU45s0s9gE", "contributor": "0x7dE6962797D4bDCDAE15fb4A258E2389fC38ecF7"}

9289 字，阅读需要约 21 分钟。觉得太长，可以把熟悉的部分直接跳过哦\\~\n\n## 1 关键时间节点回顾\n\n> 北京时间 2021 年 7 月 1 日凌晨，滴滴实行历史上独此一家的“静默上市”——没有敲钟、没有仪式、没有报道，甚至员工都不让发朋友圈，收盘时市值约 680 亿美元、4000 亿人民币；\n>\n> 7 月 2 日，网络安全审查办公室发布对“滴滴出行”启动网络安全审查的公告，为配合网络安全审查工作，防范风险扩大，审查期间“滴滴出行” 停止新用户注册。滴滴事件开始进入公众视野；\n>\n> 7 月 4 日，国家网信办通知全国应用商店下架“滴滴出行”App。根据举报，经检测核实“滴滴出行”app 存在严重违法违规收集使用个人信息问题。要求滴滴出行科技有限公司严格按照法律要求，参照国家有关标准，认真整改存在的问题，切实保障广大用户个人信息安全；\n>\n> 7 月 9 日，国家网信办通知，下架“滴滴企业版”等 25 款 App。根据举报，经检测核实，“滴滴企业版”等 25 款 App（列表附后）存在严重违法违规收集使用个人信息问题。通知应用商店下架上述 25 款 App，要求相关运营者严格按照法律要求，参照国家有关标准，认真整改存在的问题，切实保障广大用户个人信息安全。\n>\n> 12 月 3 日，滴滴宣布，将启动在纽交所退市的工作，并启动在香港上市的准备工作。\n\n网上不少文章从数据安全、政治影响、SEC 底稿审查等角度做了认真甚至透彻的分析，故不再重复。今天，我尝试从“美国主导的全球体系”角度来分析一下，这个体系是如何运作，进而做到“你创造 10 块的收益，我拿走 9 块的利润”。\n\n## 2 造富神话——创业游戏是怎么玩的？\n\n### 2.1创业艰辛路\n\n如果你是一个创业者/创始团队/高管，剧本大概是这样的：\n\n我发现了一个绝妙的 idea/产品/市场，顺便拉起了一个小团队。大家都相信我们能改变世界，一切都是很美好的样子。不过开公司太花钱了，但是经过艰苦卓绝的谈判/说服/忽悠，终于找到人愿意给我们天使投资了。虽然给的 300 万只够花 1 年的，但是有人愿意相信我、支持我，我就很开心了。虽然给出了 30%的股份，但 70%还在团队手里，这还是我们自己的事业，我们要努力！\n\n一年后，产品打磨得不错了，市场反馈非常好，但是钱花完了也没能做到自给自足，不过大家相信这是个好生意，所以还有人愿意继续投钱。历经艰苦卓绝的谈判/说服/忽悠，终于找到 A 轮投资人了！他们给我 1000 万，这次能花一年半了，虽然又给出了 25%的股份，但是股份更值钱了啊！况且我们还有 50%+在团队手里，我们要努力！\n\n一年多后，市场份额有了显著提升，并且我们有了相对稳定的赚钱模式！马上就要接近成功了，不过钱又快花完了，但是没事。经历了艰苦卓绝的谈判/说服/忽悠，终于找到 B 轮投资人了！这次拿到了 3000 万，数量不少但开销大了，也就能花个一两年吧。再次割让的 20%的股份，我们只有 40%了，但是价值可是之前的 10 倍了。而且通过投票权等方法，我们还是能控制董事会和公司方向的！\n\n之后的 6 年里，因为需要广告投放、功能开发、竞争对手贴身肉搏、快速获取新用户等各种各样的原因，我们打了一仗又一仗，加班干了一年又一年。非常幸运我们还活着没死，坚持下来的人融到了 B+/C/C+/D 等诸多轮次，每次都以 20%左右的比例稀释。虽然团队手里只有 20%左右的股份了，但是公司估值达到了 5 亿美金，30 亿人民币了，这 20%也是 6 亿！1%也是 3000 万呢！一辈子工资也挣不到这么多啊！这时，大家都期盼着公司成功上市，把估值变成市值，卖掉股票财富自由提前退休，这 8 年也算没白加班熬夜掉头发！\n\n又过了一年，我们终于和排名第二的 X 公司合并，合计取得了 86%的市场份额，一统江湖的我们，最终成功赴美上市，市值又翻了 4 倍达到了 120 亿人民币！员工都沸腾了！很晚加入的小张，也因为拿到了千分之一，成为了千万富翁。虽然这是 4 年后才能兑现的期权，不过有梦想就有动力，小张顿时觉得自己动力满满！\n\n这听上去真的是一个创业者通过奋斗改变人生，激励人心的故事啊！不过辛苦这么多年，真的能挣很多钱，甚至一辈子不用工作吗？\n\n### 2.2 一朝上市团队退休\n\n还真是的。依旧以滴滴为例，上市时团队的股权结构为：\n\n> 核心团队，持股 10.5%，投票权 20.1%；其中程维 7%，柳青 1.7%；\n>\n> 软银，持股 21.5%，投票权 21.5%；\n>\n> Uber，就是之前打仗和解的那个，持股 12.8%，投票权 12.8%；\n>\n> 腾讯，持股 6.8%，投票权 6.8%；等等等等\n\n2022 年 3 月 2 日，程维持股降到了 2.58%，柳青则是 0.25%。当前市值 200 亿美元，考虑到高点市值 680 亿美元，粗略以 300 亿美元的市值计算减持套现。程维套现 300×4.42%=13.26 亿美元；柳青套现 300×1.45%=4.35 亿美元；高管按照 0.05%计算，也有 1500 万美元。\n\n以上计算仅为粗略估算，并不代表真实数字，也没有对相关方有任何的评价或价值判断。对于个人来说，无论到手的美元是 13 亿还是 4 亿还是 1500 万，确实都是足以改变一生的财富了。奋斗十年改变一生，是很值得学习和尊敬的。\n\n那问题来了，人家企业家赚钱也是凭本事拼命干冒风险得来的，风险投资公司也都是真金白银投进来，这两者无一不是九死一生、亏损自认的。国家为什么要管控呢？难道是为了赚几百亿的利润吗？\n\n当然不是，这背后还有这样的三个问题：\n\n**1、资本逐利性与增长有限性**\n\n**2、互联网业务的基础设施化**\n\n**3、控制权争夺与代理人扶持**\n\n## 3 资本逐利性与增长有限性\n\n### 3.1 投资人的目的\n\n风险投资人为什么愿意投钱？原因很简单，就像我们买基金买股票一样，为了赚钱。那投资人为什么不去买基金买股票呢？原因很简单，这里有可能赚更多的钱。那投资人为什么愿意冒九死一生的风险投创业公司呢？原因很简单，这里有可能赚多得多的钱，以至于“一生”的项目收益远大于“九死”的投资损失。所以，如果你说我在楼下开个小餐馆，也特别赚钱，有没有风险投资人愿意来投呢？一定没有，因为他要的不是稳定赚小钱的项目，而是能在短期（一年至几年内）翻好多倍（几十倍至几十万倍）的项目。\n\n这也就是风投倾向于投互联网项目的原因——互联网产品的增长模型，天生就具有几个特点：容易复制、规模效应、利润率高。最早的三巨头新浪、网易、搜狐，都是做门户网站起家的，做的都是信息收集和分发；后来的三巨头百度、腾讯、阿里，做的是信息搜索、通讯软件、交易平台，比纯信息平台要复杂一些，但还是非实物。这里面的核心原因，就在于边际成本递减——用的人越多，每个人付出的成本越低。\n\n而实体商业往往相反，边际成本是激增的——我开一个餐厅受人欢迎，而开 100 家餐厅能累死人但反而会赔钱，选址、装修、采购、物流、质检、员工、管理等每一个环节都能够喝好几壶的。互联网相比之下就省事太多了，核心在软件产品维护及扩建服务器上，这个差别你看同样规模下两类公司的员工数量，就能有所理解。\n\n不过大家都知道纯互联网的生意好做，但是好做的生意终归是有限的。新近的三巨头字节、美团、滴滴，除了字节核心业务是纯互联网线上，另外两家已经开始 O2O 也就是线上线下混合模式了。不过即使混合了，增长速度依旧惊人。我们可以简单回顾下滴滴融资的进展和速度：\n\n![滴滴融资数据](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fnhrZiLGOqafzYKg5Ytzo.jpg?height=287&width=682)\n\n2016年起，英文字母都不怎么够用了。这些投资人投了20多轮，累计200多亿美元的投资。他们可不是慈善家，这一轮轮跟吹泡泡一样，越投越多。每一年估值至少涨两三倍，这是为啥呢？\n\n### 3.2 企业的增长极限\n\n很简单，他们相信一年后公司的成长/价值绝不止两三倍，至少得是四五倍。那么问题来了，滴滴这类互联网公司，是如何做到业务每年都以如此之快的速度增长呢？\n\n1、 市场空白期，疯狂占地，用户呈指数型增长。从最小单元（俗称 MVP）跑通模型起，就可以快速复制，每年甚至能取得 10 倍的成长。但是空白市场也有占满的一天；\n\n2、 存量争夺期，吞并对手为主，用户成倍增长。这也就是最残酷、烧钱最猛、广告最多的阶段，每打垮一个对手，或合并一个对手，都能取得用户量成倍的提升，比如历史上的滴滴快滴大战、滴滴优步大战。但是，竞争对手也会打完、市场也有占满的一天；\n\n3、 新业务开拓期，一个产品（也叫 SKU）到天花板了，还可以拓品类增加销售。比如打车好了做快车，快车好了做专车，然后是代驾、自行车、公交车、货车。但是往往新业务体量利润等指标比不上主力业务，成不了另一个主力，一般都是锦上添花，而很难成第二曲线；\n\n4、 整合变现期，市场都占满了，业务也开拓得差不多了，后续就只能开始做利润赚钱了。补贴总有停发的时候，广告也不会一直打下去，这时大家会回归商业本质，过程管理、优化流程、提高利润，俗称降本增效。但降本增效也是有天花板的，然后呢？\n\n这个时候，矛盾就凸显出来了——你说我已经很好了，一年 2000 亿的流水，150 亿的利润。但资本不这么想，它要的是增长，而且还得加速增长。一单 20 块的打车费，司机拿走 15，剩余的 5 块里做出 1 块 5 的利润，真的到头了，没法优化了。但是资本就要求你变出 2 元甚至 3 元的利润，你能怎么办呢？\n\n你应该也想到了，涨价呗——打车费涨 5 毛，司机收入降 5 毛，这 1 块钱的利润不就出来了么！\n\n屠龙少年终成恶龙\n\n## 4 基础设施化及其外部性\n\n其实这五毛一块，听上去也不是多大的事。不过呢，这就像吸毒，一旦走上了涨价这条路，就得两块三块四块的一直涨，往往很难停下来了——直到用户抗议或选择用脚投票离开。听上去涨涨价也没什么太大问题呀？大多数情况涨价不是问题，但是滴滴这类企业有一大特点，他们的服务会逐步地基础设施化。这是什么意思呢？\n\n### 4.1 基础设施\n\n基础设施的核心特点，是会被用于保证国家或地区社会经济活动正常进行的，具有公共服务性质的系统。诸如电子商务、移动支付、线上交通、甚至外卖快递等，在诞生之初确实是创新产业。但是随着近几年移动互联网的快速普及，这些都成了我们日常生活中不可或缺的部分，任意一个故障或停转，都会导致社会运行的严重问题。\n\n而基础设施如果被资本逐利性所控制，以产生最大利润为目标，会产生什么问题呢？我举一个例子，大家应该就能理解了。\n\n通信公司（如中国移动等）的日子好过吗？\n\n一二十年前，通信公司确实有一段不短的时间，日子非常舒服。以至于当年顶级学府的毕业生，求职热门目标不是什么互联网、金融，也不是公务员，而是进入通信行业的企业，特别是中国移动。原因无他，建通信网络和基础设施这件事，是真的苦；但建成了收电话费赚利润这件事，也是真的爽。所以自然从上到下的福利待遇、薪酬奖金、竞争压力等等，都特别有优势。\n\n之后 4G 诞生了，通信公司的好日子也逐渐木有了。倒不是因为 4G 干砸了赔钱，反而是因为 4G 发展得太好——国家提出了要求，各大运营商必须主动开始“降费提速”。中国移动最大的一次“降费提速”公布于 2015 年 5 月 15 日，大家可以上网自行查阅。话说，这又是为什么呢？这带来了什么变化呢？\n\n* 移动互联网的大爆发\n\n### 4.2 基础设施的社会意义\n\n是的，任何新事物的产生，都有其前提条件，就像数学的发展支撑了物理、显微镜的诞生改变了生物。没有运营商的降费提速，也就没有移动互联网发展起来的可能。大家不妨设想一下，如果移动上网资费不是现在的几十块，而是参考汇率和国外通行价格的几百块上千块，会是什么结果？\n\n上一次网流量费就要几块钱，那你还会使用移动支付吗？还会扫码骑车吗？还会玩网络游戏吗？\n\n看一段视频的流量费就要十几块几十块，那你还会视频聊天吗？还会刷抖音快手吗？还会看美女主播/带货直播吗？看完了还有钱打赏、有钱买货吗？\n\n如果没有以上这些，手机还有人买吗？app 还会有人写程序开发吗？那些投资人、创业者还会干这行吗？\n\n所以说，基础设施决定了上层应用的发展。基础设施的普及程度，也就是使用费用也决定了上层应用的发展模式、速度、规模甚至是存在与否。\n\n### 4.3 牺牲小我换取外部性\n\n而随着中国移动的基础设施化，它自身的好日子肯定不复存在了。甚至可以设想，之前投资的大笔财富建立的基站、网络、人工、体系等，还没赚到什么钱或赔着钱的时候，就不得不“降费提速”，牺牲自己了。在这个领域内，运营商确实牺牲了个体利益来推动社会前进和发展——这在经济学上叫做基础设施的外部性。\n\n中国作为一个整体，在过去几十年内，一直有着一个又一个类似的个体——行政、教育、医疗、公路、高铁、电力、水利、通信、邮政、警察、解放军等等，他们每一个人，都在做着类似的贡献甚至牺牲，也正是他们，保护着、推动着国家几十年的高速增长和发展。这真的是值得我们尊敬、骄傲及感谢的。\n\n另一个角度，我们不妨再做一下设想，如果中国移动不是“国家控制”，而是“资本控制”，以个体利益最大化作为目标，会发生什么呢？\n\n### 4.4 资本控制下的基础设施\n\n我是平行时空的“移不动”总裁办主任，针对当前情况，我觉得公司应该做以下动作：\n\n1、 “降费提速”肯定是不可能的。不论上市与否，股东们是不会接受利益损失的。作为公司经营管理者，就得为股东负责，而不是为国家负责，国家号召又不是法律，我们不是必须响应。否则，年底我们怎么跟股东解释利润下滑、成本上升呢？解释不了丢了工作谁管我们呢？我们不但不能降低利润，还得想方设法提高利润；\n\n2、 不但不降费，还得涨费。资本要持续增值，股东也想越赚越多，我们的薪酬福利才能越来越好。那怎么才能赚得越来越多呢？流量费、电话费作为主要的收入和利润来源，涨价肯定是最直接的办法。但是突然涨肯定导致大量客户流失，那就以各种理由慢慢涨价好了，涨价节奏交给运营部来办，涨价理由交给公关部来想；\n\n3、 不甘于“基础设施化”，一方面积极防御、一方面下场竞争。“x 信”这种应用绝对是“移不动”最大的竞争对手，有了不要钱的“x 信”，未来谁还会打电话发短信呢？肯定大受影响啊！那怎么办呢？\n\n1. 积极防御。经过内部头脑风暴，我们集思广益出以下方案：舆论攻势，x 信不稳定、安全性差、骚扰频繁、骗子横行，智能手机用多了影响视力、容易造成老年痴呆；“涨费”，大幅提高上网费用，让发文字的流量费超过短信费，让发语音的流量费超过打电话；“降速”，限制 x 信类 app 的访问速度，或降低其稳定性，降低用户体验。还可以配合舆论攻势——x 信优化真叫烂，要么缓慢要么断；\n2. 下场竞争。通过投资、并购、自己干等方法，一定要把未来握在自己手中！肉烂也得烂在锅里！我们可以：商谈控股或并购 x 信；扶持或投资 x 信的竞争对手；鼓励内部创业，孵化类 x 信项目；自己成立 n 个项目组，抄也得抄一个。针对我们的项目，同时在流量、费用、资源等方面，给予足够的支持和倾斜：比如定向 app 流量包；以低价货免费的方法推广；植入现有套餐推广发布；合约手机默认安装等等；\n\n4、 只要做好执行，我们相信“移不动”集团就像新时代的“喜马拉雅山”，不管是 x 信视频、手机支付、直播电商、智能出行、外卖餐饮，只要能和手机沾边的，我们都能搞定！纵使世界风云变幻，我“移不动”岿然不动！\n\n是不是有些剧情还挺眼熟的？所谓的“纯粹市场竞争”最有利于消费者，并不是事实的全部。当你大到了具备类似基础设施的级别时，个体利益的最大化，反而会阻碍整体的发展。这时就像一首打油诗一样——此山是我开，此树是我栽，要想此路过，留下买路财。\n\n### 4.5 时代变迁与基础设施发展\n\n二十年前，公路电网是基础设施，“中国移动”是上层应用；十年前“中国移动”变成了基础设施，移动互联网是上层应用；到了今天，互联网乃至移动互联网也变成了基础设施，下一个上层应用是什么尚未可知。所以有句话“这不是马云创造了时代，而是时代创造了马云”。但如果出行、吃饭、开店、交易、快递等过程，越来越多地消耗掉大多数人的大多数财产，新的上层应用一定无法顺利的破壳发展。\n\n基础设施作为长期投资，需要持续微利甚至无利运营。这和资本追求短期眼前收益是有底层矛盾的，这也是不能让资本控制基础设施的核心原因之一。\n\n大家不要觉得这些问题不可能发生，如果你身在一亿多人口的大国墨西哥，就能体验到：\n\n> 几十分钟才能下载完百兆更新包的网速；\n>\n> paypal 转账收款，就要交 4.4%+0.49 美元一笔的手续费；\n>\n> 比国内贵 50%多，但在出生、婚礼甚至宗教仪式上几乎必备的可口可乐；\n>\n> 甚至总统的上一份工作就是可口可乐某地区的 CEO。\n\n这就涉及到另一个关键问题了：\n\n## 5 新时代的经济“殖民地”\n\n“离天堂太远，离美国太近”。中国固然不会像墨西哥一样，毒贩厉害过政府和军队；也不会有发 100 块红包只能收到 95 块的微信或支付宝。但是，中国所融入的美国主导的国际体系，是不可能便宜你的——前文所讲的类似“滴滴”这样的互联网公司，就是一种高级玩法——一整套复杂的创业体系。\n\n### 5.1 资本的通吃游戏\n\n风险投资确实是败多成少、风险极高的事情。正所谓，越小的事情越难预测，越短的时间也越难看清；但是，站在更大的角度分析，站在更长的时间去观察，这件事失败的概率、看走眼的风险就小得多了。就好比 8 年前，让你判断出滴滴能成为中国最大的网约车平台，甚至最大的互联网出行平台，这个事太难了，谁也说不准。而如果 8 年前，让你判断中国未来会不会有一家公司占据互联网出行一大半乃至全部的份额？这个就很容易了，不少人都能看出来，一定是有的。\n\n作为某一家投资公司个体来说，因为资金量有限，我只能投资有限的几家公司。而如果把美元资本作为一个整体来看，钱就完全不是问题了，只要你干网约车，甭管叫啥干的咋样，都投资点看看呗。反正早期花钱也不多，投资也是一点一点加注的。只要最终胜出了一家公司（两三家也没事，再打一打或者直接合并），我就是赚的。这就是有些人常说的，所谓“投行业”。滴滴收到风投 200 亿美元，全行业应该不超过 300 亿美元。这么大的一笔钱投行业，真的值吗？\n\n### 5.2 公司收入与利润分配\n\n真的值，滴滴 2021 年收入应该在 1800 亿元左右。2000 亿投出一个每年 1800 亿营收的公司，真的不亏。那这些投资占了多少股份呢？前文所述，上市时公司团队持股 10.5%，也就是接近 90%的股权都在各个投资人手里。即使不算上市后核心团队卖掉的 6%，滴滴这家公司，也已经基本不属于中国创始团队了，它属于国际资本、也就是西方资本了。而这家公司的收入是怎么来的呢？\n\n看财报，94.3%来自中国出行市场，4.1%来自投资收益，1.6%来自海外市场。这真的是一家标准的中国公司。也就是说，滴滴的价值是靠中国的司机开车、乘客付费、程序员产品经理加班，以及“中国移动”这样牺牲了小我所构建的基础设施，一起养育孵化出来的。换句话说，如果没有去年的国家干预，后续走上一年一块钱的涨价之路，这里面压榨出的利润，90%甚至 100%都会回到美国手里。\n\n你说不对啊，不是还有 10%在团队手里么？其实这也只是看起来在团队手里。\n\n### 5.3 美股上市、控制权与代理人\n\n美元基金投资大概率都在美股上市，这里面的细节条款要求等就不和大家展开了。为什么要去美股上市呢？这恰恰是闭环的最后一步，也是控制争夺的重要一步。美股上市不仅仅是地理位置和货币种类的区别，更重要的是定价权、监管权、控制权的区别。特别在 2021 年前后，国际形势产生了重大变化。对于中国公司而言，安全形势也有了重大变化，或者叫恶化。举两个例子大家就能理解这里面的道道了。\n\n这两个例子都得感谢美国，给世界民众，特别是中国人民上了生动形象的一课又一课。\n\n其一，华为孟晚舟事件。拘禁高管迫使公司屈服，这并不是什么新鲜玩法，而是古已有之。比如法国阿尔斯通也受过类似遭遇。因为法国政府无法顶住并给予支持，阿尔斯通难逃被肢解吞噬的命运。世界舞台真的不是什么讲规则、文明竞争的地方。公司体量再大、市值再高，在国家机器面前也是不堪一击的蝼蚁。但从另一个角度讲，如果华为是美股上市公司呢？\n\n那美国真的不用拘禁孟晚舟了，因为他会有无数种办法制服你或让你完蛋。另一个国家的公司也通过自身实际的经历，帮我们证实了这样的办法真的存在。\n\n其二，俄罗斯各大上市公司。如果你持有在美国或英国上市的俄罗斯公司股票，3 月 3 日，应该已经收到了这样一个通知“由于当地政府制裁因素，目前美股、英股等市场已经暂停俄罗斯股票开仓。若投资者有相关股票持仓，需在一定期限内卖出，否则会被券商强平。截至目前，港股市场的俄罗斯股票仍然能正常交易。”\n\n所谓的个人财产神圣不可侵犯？你猜这些资产跌到地板价后，谁有资格买下来呢？为什么港股还能正常交易呢？如果某个小岛出了一些事件，美股上市的中国公司会是什么待遇呢？为什么国家限制公司去美股上市呢？为什么要求大公司都回港二次上市呢？\n\n### 5.4 培植代理人和买办的体系\n\n> “你太髙看他们了，他们懂得什么是资本主义？最多倒退到半封建半殖民地社会。资本主义是靠侵略和掠夺别的国家而积累资产的。而他们敢于侵略谁呀？不被侵略就阿弥陀佛啦！他们只能剥削本民族的百姓，或者贱卖自己国家的资源。”\n\n——毛泽东\n\n也许企业家的初心是造福人民，但整套系统和体系，根本不是为了“造福人民”这个目标而设计的。纵使极个别人能抵抗得住诱惑和系统的力量，但全世界来看，这套培养代理人和买办的系统设计是非常成功的——小到公司、大到国家，全世界范围内不被收割、独立自主、说了能算的又有几个呢？\n日本韩国加拿大、德国法国意大利、巴西智利阿根廷、泰国印尼菲律宾，名单可以列出一两百，而这里面真正独立自主的，一个都没有（能抗住不让美国驻军的就没有）——这就是为什么，当今世界是美国主导下的全球体系。\n有人说了，在我手里的股权不安全，那在我手里的钱总该是安全的吧？公司在国家面前都毫无抵抗之力，你为啥对自己这么有信心呢？\n\n![个人财产神圣不可侵犯](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nb9-6WdAmGQnSIVGzbG-s.jpg?height=785&width=639)\n\n## 总结一下\n\n1、 互联网行业为代表的创业故事，往往遵循着“风投、厮杀、垄断、上市”的剧本，美元风投投行业，内部厮杀出胜者，垄断行业拿利润，境外上市回美国；\n\n2、 而这个剧本也是美国金融体系搭建的一个完整收割闭环。为了强化闭环的执行和落地，这套体系也在有意的培育代理人，并分给其“巨额”的小利，对外包装为自我奋斗改变人生的故事；\n\n3、 问题之一：基础设施的资本化，会透支社会下一个阶段发展的动力和能量，降低民众生活质量提高生活成本，并且影响下一波生产力发展和社会进步。故，基础设施化的业务因其极强的外部性，需保持微利甚至赔钱补贴运转；\n\n4、 问题之二：境外资产的安全性，丛林法则下，永远留不住力量范围之外的资产和财富。国际社会的基本准则并不是什么契约精神、个人财产神圣不可侵犯，真实环境下的基本准则是我的规则你必须遵守、我的财产你不可侵犯。这些如何确保？拳头说了算；\n\n5、 故，在此大变局之下，不少互联网公司也会巨变：其一，基础设施化，从高增长高利润变为稳定市场微利润；其二，美股上市财务自由的路，几乎不再能复现了。\n\n希望这两篇文章的 14000 字，能给帮大家对外，多一个角度认知世界；对内，多一个方法看懂周围。那在这么艰难的时代，我们还有机会吗？答案当然是有，至于具体是什么，后面三篇文章，同样从宏观到微观，分享一下我的思考：2022，更加艰难的下一年，有无抓得住的机会。", "timestamp": 1658151517, "digest": "-CIezTxaBzmo2GzMUT2bwpIJJxJglgT6Ano8wi8ybr0",

{"id": "jz2pMrJ33aDCcoY6j0kij0Wck-sWafT4b96ZUvYG4rA", "title": "Web3 startups", "body": "These are some applications, startups and protocols that have the most potential and that are closely aligned with web3's mission of decentralization and distribution of value.\n\n**Mirror**: You could say that Mirror is the web3 alternative to Medium. A web3 protocol oriented to blogging. In the case of Medium, it is not so much the percentage that remains of the creators, so I am not going to bar them as much, but even so, it owns all the content, controls the exposure algorithms, and does not let the creators monetize themselves from other ways. It explicitly prohibits any link and is free to block anyone who does not follow \"its policies\", as it did in 2018.\n\nMirror proposes a native web3 alternative where creators can monetize in various ways they can think of. It allows, for example, to create NFT of the articles so that they can sell them or do a crowd-founding prior to writing so that fans can finance content. Also, the content is ours, not mirror's, and they use decentralized servers like Arweave (which I'll talk about later) so that the information is eternal.\n\n**Lens Protocol**: This project is focused on identity, data portability and the social. They created the social layer 0 that allows developers to invent applications that run on this blockchain/protocol and that, for example, we can switch between applications while maintaining full control of our preferences, privacy, and our connections (friends). The next Twitter, Instagram or Facebook will be built on Lens, but unlike current business models, they will not be able to exploit our information for advertising or invent vicious algorithms to keep us looking at the screen.\n\nI talk more about Lens in my other note on identity.\n\n**BAT**: Basic Attention Token is an initiative of the Brave browser that was invented by Brendan Eich who is none other than the inventor of JavaScript, Mozilla and Firefox. Brave is a browser that blocks all third-party cookies (Google Ads, etc.) that spy on our behavior in order to offer us invasive advertising. By blocking all tracheas we become invisible to corporations that want to exploit our information, and on top of that browsing is faster because you don't have to load all the JavaScript for these cookies.\n\nBut in order not to leave advertisers out, Brave offers incentives in the BAT token for those who wish to receive advertising voluntarily, let's say. So you browse, you are aware that you are giving information to advertisers and in exchange for that, you receive advertising. A win-win, or at least a fairer, logical and less extractive way. At least we get something.\n\n**OpenSea**: OpenSea is the leading marketplace for NFT exchanges. It is the easiest to understand what it is for because it is as if it were an Amazon or MercadoLibre, something that already exists, but unlike web2 marketplaces, OpenSea publishes the content of our wallets, it does not own our information. We can choose to publish them on OpenSea or quickly go to a competitor. It is as if we had an NFT of our MercadoLibre publications and we could change the platform whenever we wanted.\n\nGiven the portability of the data, OpenSea is open source, since it does not gain anything by not being open source, on the contrary, it is a competitive advantage to be open source in crypto rather than not. If you are open source and open, others can join you, allowing you to maintain your leadership position. OpenSea charges 2.5% also because it is what the market allows, otherwise a competitor that charges less can easily appear.\n\n**Arweave**: It is a network similar to IPFS+Filecoin, but under this system eternal storage is guaranteed. Due to the logic of this blockchain, the miners who receive the $AR (Arweave) token must be able to demonstrate access to random content/file at all times in order to validate new transactions. This forces the miners to continue to keep copies of the old files because otherwise they cannot continue mining.\n\nI talk more about decentralized storage in this note\n\n**ENS**: Ethereum Name Service is like a router from blockchain addresses (wallets) to names in text format, with .eth at the end. The project lets you register a domain, like a .com, but an .eth, and assign the wallet to which it corresponds. More similar to how an alias works, but this alias is yours and you can assign the wallet you need to it.\n\nENS is also an open-source protocol and is run entirely by the ENS DAO where every change or improvement is voted on. The domains have an annual cost, but they do this so that no one abuses the system and that those who use it have the opportunity to use them. Also everything generated is donated to charity, so ENS is a non-profit organization.\n\n**Metamask**:", "timestamp": 1658151891, "digest": "6q8Ed53BFv0yeOzh6F12ddOrfRHJk2FT2vrmCh47JdY", "contributor": "0x7E0b0363404751346930AF92C80D1fef932Cc48a"}

In a broader sense, *Crisis* is an ongoing multi-media, multi-level experiment that explores alternative ideas for the distribution and exploitation of musical works. It is the journey of an album that defied the dominant structures of its system in order to break new ground.\n\nThis project aims to align *releases* ↔︎ *value* ↔︎ *community* into one common narrative. Read more about the process below.\n\n## Season 00 – The Story\n\nOne year ago the journey of Crisis began with the release of *[Crisis (The Worthless Album)](https://open.spotify.com/album/7nwbv2tj8q9OTWhin3ZBsm).* What had been planned as a traditional release, changed due to a pivotal decision.\n\nThe album was cut into 30 pieces, each 29 seconds long. Since a stream only starts counting after 30 seconds of playtime, it can't collect plays or earn any revenue, no matter how much it's listened to. The value of this album is 0.000$\n\nUltimately, this is the only way to choose one's own value in the current system of being patronised by a pro-rata system (streaming) of big tech and major labels. By releasing an album this way, it reveals quite the imbalance and absurdity of the music industry's current monetisation model and asks if centralised platforms should define the value of art according to a demand-supply calculation. Or, instead, shall creators regain complete control over the value they create.\n\n> \"*Valentin Hansen released an album in a way that’s never been done before. In doing so, he highlighted the unprecedented shift in how music is being made as a direct result of the rule.*\"\n> — Brian Harrington, [The Album That's Worth Nothing](https://deathbyalgorithm.substack.com/p/the-album-thats-worth-nothing)\n\nNo matter how many of the industry tricks we utilised, we ended up in a zero-sum game.\n\n![An exhibition with a click farm.

Retail price: 0.00 $ € £ ₽ ₩](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rIQn5Iqm0bbR5OW3Wy_OU.png?height=1984&width=3062)\n\n![Spotify’s 2021 wrapped looked as expected: 0 Streams, 0 Listeners, 0 Hours, 0 Countries](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kKPpqY4bmsyioxNArLKFr.png?height=1024&width=1024)\n\n## Process\n\n*Crisis (The Album)* will now embark on a multi-level journey to be transformed and have its monetary and cultural worth evaluated by the community. To put it more simply, we will distribute ownership of *Crisis* during 9+ seasons.\n\nTherefore, the original album was minted as one piece of music on [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/valentinhansen/crisis-the-album-).\n\nOwnership of this NFT will be represented by each season's tokens (editions of NFTs), with 50% of the shares being transferred within the first nine seasons. Additionally, each season represents the album in its current form. As seasonal NFTs are collected, the album starts to change visually, sonically, & experientially until that particular season sells out.\n\nUpon sellout, a new season unlocks, shape- shifting the album once more and unlocking further experiences, products, visuals, etc.\n\nThe remaining 50% will be allocated in season 10. This way—when the album becomes the most expensive work of music ever sold—it'll be fully owned by the community that helped it reach this status.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iIhgeVic-qPXG15O8qcM5.jpg?height=2589&width=2767)\n\nThe journey will continue as long as people keep unlocking the next chapter. Season NFTs will be sold in the form of editions on Mirror.\n\n## Seasons\n\nThe journey will be split into 9+1 defined seasons as listed below:\n\n\n**↳ [Season 01:](https://kaf.mirror.xyz/Am2H3L-3e0VJKL-PeYezdAi1i559unIgTYARHn1Mg6s)**[ The Valuable Album](https://kaf.mirror.xyz/Am2H3L-3e0VJKL-PeYezdAi1i559unIgTYARHn1Mg6s)\\*\\*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FCAUBeQwJyfV3HzyYMaWK.png?height=1174&width=2178)\n\n↳ **[Season 02: The Raw Album](https://kaf.mirror.xyz/hhc_wUnEZfnstT967p5Yy9X-K8GkmzUluwPM-7Jvwmc)**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FlrA03P0kpdXvK0qXjKA3.png?height=1174&width=2178)\n\nSeason 03: The Performance Album\n\nSeason 04: Remix Album\n\nSeason 05: The Visual Album\n\nSeason 06: The Commercial Album\n\nSeason 07: The ________ Album\n\nSeason 08: The ________ Album\n\nSeason 09: The ________ Album\n\nSeason 10: The Most Valuable Album", "timestamp": 1658152305, "digest": "t6muHDOnubQAq5jhcKEf3icIQoOHUQro46TW8t9xKd8", "contributor": "0x6fAf6Db1a026E730935a1351133C4c99DaAE4DDA"}

This will drive the creation of new applications that promote ownership, participation and community. We believe that the ownership economy will transform the internet, and with it our digital and physical lives.\n\nBut this web3 future still needs to be built and shaped. So we started Project Vellir.\n\nProject Vellir’s mission is to improve understanding of web3/crypto technology; build web3 solutions, including to problems related to governance, coordination, ownership, participation and community; and support companies and governments with the rapid transition to web3.\n\n**We do this by combining public insight, an advisory practice and in house studio, a thoughtful community and web3 native investment platform.**\n\nOur thesis is based on three overlapping themes.\n\n1. **Democratic processes and institutions:** The Vellir Project takes inspiration from Þingvellir (the \"Assembly Fields\") in Iceland, site of the longest running Parliament in the world. In the early 10th century, it was a meeting place for clans to hold discussions and legal sessions, and subsequently became the site of the Icelandic Parliament, now in Reykjavik. The site was chosen because it was accessible for all clans for their annual parliament. And while we still have the same fundamental participation, community decision-making and governance needs to address, there are no longer the same constraints on geography, physical representation and time between consulting citizens. We believe that web3 tools have the potential to be the Þingvellirs of the future – creating new accessible gathering places, and transforming how participatory systems, governance and policy processes, models and institutions work.\n2. **Financial inclusion:** Financial inclusion means more than just having access to a bank account. It means having a meaningful stake in society and the capital economy. This requires ownership of data and assets, and means that close creating value with the insights from their data also gain some of the upside. The rise of the sovereign individual has the potential to radically change financial inclusion through DeFi, community ownership and social tokens. We believe that this broader democratisation has the potential to create universal basic equity, which could be an important feature of a more equal and fair social and economic structure.\n3. **Protecting and rewarding data, privacy and security:** A core part of a positive internet future is one where data is owned and encrypted; privacy is the default and built in; and infrastructure is secure. The web3 stack is evolving quickly, but we believe it must have these features embedded from the outset in order to be sustainable and meet the needs of consumers.\n\nSubscribe to get our latest insights at www.vellir.xyz - and come and start your web3 journey with us!", "timestamp": 1658151974, "digest": "rF4qJVS6w1ZmEnkOjYu1Fj7FM8fNYvFJzrtnMeTLMJs", "contributor": "0x497C01E5cE8B7d3D5175e192f0bd09d1daC912c4"}

Hemos pasado de usar el correo a tener tokens que nos dan **acceso** a diferente **contenido**.\n\nNos gusta formar parte de comunidades, nos gusta tener algo especial y único para nosotros. Coleccionamos cromos desde pequeños y nos gusta juntarnos con gente con la misma **visión, gustos y/o interés**.\n\nEsa es la **experiencia** que se genera con un **token**, nos da un **prestigio**, un **estatus** social y además de todo eso, tiene **escasez**, la **experiencia** de tener algo **exclusivo** solo para unos cuantos.\n\nEn este artículo explicaré como nació token gating y como de dar acceso a una página web, se ha convertido en un **estándar en el ecosistema**.\n\n### Utilidad del token\n\nEn todos los social tokens o monedas de comunidad, hay tres característicos importantes:\n\n* **Utilidad**: que le ofreces a tu comunidad si compran tu token\n* **Distribución**: a quien distribuyes tu token\n* **Liquidez**: tener un mercado secundario donde nuevos miembros puedan comprar y entrar en la comunidad\n\nA día de hoy, tenemos 20.258 monedas en el mercado.

Esto que parece obvio ahora, hace unos años no se percibía de la misma manera. El foco estaba en DeFi, estaba en proporcionar **liquidez** y poco a poco en **distribuirlo** a miembros específicos, los famosos airdrops. Pero pocos se enfocaban en el next step, en **qué hacer con el token**.\n\nDesde [MintGate](https://twitter.com/mintgate_io) estudiamos cómo se comportaban los tokens y de qué manera un artista, un creador de contenido o una marca los pueden utilizar.\n\nLa primera pregunta fue; ¿qué le gusta a un fan, que le hace sentir especial? La respuesta: **exclusividad**. Sentirse parte de una comunidad cercana, poder comunicarse con su creador de contenido favorito y tener privilegios por estar ahí.\n\nDe ahí salió **Token Gated Access**. Poner una barrera entre un contenido premium y tu comunidad. **Eliminando por completo la necesidad de acceder con una contraseña**.\n\n[https://forefront.market/blog/guest-david-token-ownership](https://forefront.market/blog/guest-david-token-ownership)\n\n### Pero, ¿que es token gating?\n\nLa definición más simple es **restringir** el **acceso** a **contenido exclusivo** exigiendo a los miembros de una comunidad que **adquieran un NFT o número de tokens específico**.\n\nEl token actúa como **clave de acceso** que se verifica conectando la wallet.\n\n¿Cuál es ese contenido que necesita \"protección\"? En realidad, cualquier contenido digital, desde un sitio web, contenidos exclusivos, chats privados en Discord hasta eventos virtuales en Decentraland.\n\nLo hemos visto en plataformas como [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/), donde miembros pagan una suscripción por acceder a contenido exclusivo. ¿Pero, y si le **damos la vuelta** a eso y **pagas una entrada, una vez, y accedes para siempre**? Las principales características de token gating son:\n\n* **Acceso**: tanto ha contenido como un grupo de chat\n* **Seguridad**: no se puede acceder con una pestaña en oculto o compartir externamente. Solo aquellos que tengan los tokens pueden visualizar.\n* **Utilidad**: el token es solo la puerta de entrada, puedes monetizar o dar perks en una comunidad\n\nToken gating permite a las comunidades beneficiarse del control de quién tiene acceso a sus contenidos. Puedes **crear diferentes rangos** y dar **beneficios** a aquellos que **contribuyen**.\n\nEl acceso con token es una forma de **mejorar la seguridad**. Solo se puede acceder a los datos almacenados mediante token gating una vez que el usuario ha demostrado su **identidad**. Por lo tanto, token gating es una puerta perfecta para crear **sistemas de verificación de varios niveles**. Pasamos de solo acceder a contenido a proteger páginas webs. Un [A/B test](https://vwo.com/es/ab-testing/), donde aquellos que tengan 100 tokens ven algo diferente de aquellos que solo tengan un NFT.\n\nEste nuevo mecanismo para **monetizar el contenido o el acceso** viene con varios beneficios para los creadores y los miembros, no solo alineando los incentivos, sino también convirtiendo los servicios y productos en activos que puedes tener ownership sobre ello y venderlo. **Ya no es solo una contraseña, sino un activo digital.**\n\nEl token gating es una forma de **añadir más valor a un token**, permitiendo al titular el acceso exclusivo a una comunidad, contenido o incluso productos físicos además del token. **Una contraseña con beneficios**. \n\n### Casos de uso\n\nPara [crear](https://medium.com/mintgate/announcing-token-protected-pages-23d917c37727) un **token gated access**, se necesitaban 3 pasos; el contenido que quieres proteger, con que token, y el mínimo requerido. Si era una colección de NFTs, podías hasta indicar unos ID específicos (solo el BAYC 2121, 3131 y 4141).\n\nUno de los primeros casos de uso que tuvimos fue una [página web](https://jnryfirst.com/firstaudio) con [$FIRST](https://twitter.com/harrisonfirst?s=20&t=Acv6zJNdotZ39aJpxuH23A) donde los miembros de la comunidad tenían acceso exclusivo a contenido de audio para usar en sus NFTs. De ahí empezamos a **tokenizar** **acceso** a una **playlist de Spotify, un artículo, videos o documentos en Google Drive para DAOs**. Desde que lanzamos nuestra plataforma, hemos tenido mas de **27.300 miembros** utilizando token gated links.\n\n**La utilidad es abierta** al creador o a la comunidad, **no hay límites**, cualquier contenido digital, se puede proteger y encriptar con un token, dando **seguridad a los miembros** y haciendo que el contenido sea **únicamente exclusivo para ellos**. Nosotros pusimos una herramienta sencilla, ellos crearon acceso a:\n\n* Trabajo (**Calendly, Zoom, Google Drive, Dropbox**)\n* IRL meet (**Formularios, RSVP, Tickets**)\n* Video (**Youtube, Vimeo**)\n* Música (**Spotify, SoundCloud, Audius**)\n* Web (**Dominio propio, Shopify**)\n\n![Experiencia token gated con los Golden State Warriors](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QsSTvq8joeQNyJspiHfLx.jpeg?height=694&width=1400)\n\nEn cuanto a comunidad, destacaría [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/). Es la **comunidad por referencia** en el ecosistema de social tokens. Hogar de muchas subculturas, FWB existe como un ecosistema de relaciones, un estudio creativo descentralizado y un grupo de chat interminable. Para leer su newsletter o acceder al discord necesitas tener una **cantidad mínima de tokens**.\n\n[Stoner Cats](https://www.stonercats.com/), fue sin duda un **siguiente paso en token gating**, creando una serie de animación para adultos (creada por Mila Kunis y Ashton Kutcher). Para poder ver cada nuevo episodio de la serie, es necesario **ser titular de uno de los NFT** de Stoner Cats.\n\nLos servicios token gated son especialmente **importantes** para los **creadores** y/o **marcas**, ya que les permiten centrarse en **ofrecer un buen servicio**, encontrar usuarios que quieran ese servicio, y centrarse en a**portar valor al usuario**. Esto es bueno para los usuarios, porque pueden **pagar menos y tener una mejor experiencia**. Es bueno para los creadores, porque pueden mantener sus negocios y **generar nuevas vías de monetización** al mismo tiempo, **creando una comunidad**. \n\nEs un nuevo modelo para **crear una comunidad fiel** y darles **beneficios** por formar parte de ella. Hasta **Shopify** ha introducido **Tokengated Experiences** hace unas semanas:\n\n[https://twitter.com/Shopify/status/1539610296200974338?s=20&t=LmgxEjqE4JFH2ZbfGTGLZw](https://twitter.com/Shopify/status/1539610296200974338?s=20&t=LmgxEjqE4JFH2ZbfGTGLZw)\n\n### Más allá de un acceso restringido\n\nRealmente, podemos ir más allá con gated access, no tiene que quedarse en un link, es difícil de distribuir y no es tan fácil monetizar de una manera directa. **Utilizarlo más allá de un sistema de verificación, implementando-lo directamente en un NFT**. Dar v**alor intrínseco** al token añadiendo contenido restringido.\n\nUn contenido exclusivo incrementa su valor en forma de NFT, pudiéndose vender directamente a una audiencia conservando todo el valor. Es como Patreon pero sin la plataforma, porque el **contenido puede vivir en cualquier lugar**. Es agnóstico a una plataforma, el contenido estará donde tú elijas.\n\n**Token gating es una forma de sobrecargar un NFT**, lo que otorga más valor a su propiedad. Además de poseer el contenido de un video NFT, eBook NFT, Ticket NFT o Link NFT, también puede garantizar que **solo sus propietarios puedan acceder** a ese contenido. Un ejemplo de ello fue mi presentación en ETHBarcelona, al acabar, todo el mundo que coleccionaba [mi NFT](https://tomu.mintgate.io/projects/cultura-tokenizada) tenia mi ppt gated, las diapositivas presentadas. Ese NFT no se ha quedado ahí, cualquiera que lo coleccione **tendrá acceso exclusivo a futuro contenido**. \n\nConvertir el contenido en un asset digital significa que se convierte en algo que el propietario puede revender. **No puedo revender mi suscripción**, pero puedo **revender un video NFT** que compré la semana pasada por más de lo que me costó, o incluso **prestarlo** mientras voy **generando un ingreso pasivo**.\n\n### Comunidades web3\n\nEsto es lo que hizo que toda comunidad tokenizada **tenga un sitio** donde **compartir** información, tener un chat protegido solo para aquellos que tienen un **token en particular**. Hace dos veranos fue cuando [Collab.land](https://collab.land/) surgió y domino los grupos de chat tanto en Telegram como en Discord. Cualquiera integraba sus servicios para crear un **canal exclusivo para holders**. Desde esos momentos, donde Collab.land se enfocaba en **chat** y MintGate en **contenido digital**, hemos visto que más y más plataformas han salido construyendo en este vertical. Si tengo que destacar dos de ellos, sin duda son:\n\n* [Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com/) - Control de acceso descentralizado para aplicaciones web3 y datos privados en un Internet abierto.\n* [Guild](https://guild.xyz/) - ‘Token-enabled membership’. Puedes crear niveles exclusivos en tu comunidad y administrarlos con diferentes tokens.\n\nAhora, ya nos **comunicamos** con gente que tiene el **mismo token**. O incluso, [lensfrens](https://www.lensfrens.xyz/) te enseña a quien seguir en base a tu huella en web3, en base a aquello que compartes con esa persona desde un punto de vista de token. **Conecta tu wallet, y descubres a qué comunidad perteneces**:\n\n* [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/) - una comunidad para cada token. Commonwealth es una plataforma todo en uno para que las comunidades discutan, voten y financien proyectos de manera colectiva.\n* [Backdrop](https://backdrop.so/)- ayudan a todo el mundo a participar en las comunidades tokenizadas de la web3. La verdad, perdemos demasiado tiempo en discord, esta es la manera de estar pendiente de todo lo que ocurre y dónde contribuir.\n\nYa no necesitamos generar 100 contraseñas para todas las páginas webs o apps que accedemos, ahora nos **conectamos** con **nuestra wallet** y **descubrimos** un n**uevo mundo**. Podemos diseñar comunidades más fieles, enfocadas en 100 fans que de verdad quieran contribuir y formar parte de **algo exclusivo**. \n\nUn token hace que decidamos donde **comunicarnos** con nuestra comunidad, darles la oportunidad de **participar** en el contenido, no depender de una plataforma y ofrecerles una **experiencia única**.\n\nTodo está ahí, a un clic de generar una nueva experiencia, una experiencia única, una **experiencia token gated**.", "timestamp": 1658152110, "digest": "_0tAHc17rzRtQ4qdoxmcP041yugSG05iz3Prqoqi-Hs", "contributor": "0x98397A068d413D3C92A506f98c5F25D33A9DAc14"}

Un [A/B test](https://vwo.com/es/ab-testing/), donde aquellos que tengan 100 tokens ven algo diferente de aquellos que solo tengan un NFT.\n\nEste nuevo mecanismo para **monetizar el contenido o el acceso** viene con varios beneficios para los creadores y los miembros, no solo alineando los incentivos, sino también convirtiendo los servicios y productos en activos que puedes tener ownership sobre ello y venderlo. **Ya no es solo una contraseña, sino un activo digital.**\n\nEl token gating es una forma de **añadir más valor a un token**, permitiendo al titular el acceso exclusivo a una comunidad, contenido o incluso productos físicos además del token. **Una contraseña con beneficios**. \n\n### Casos de uso\n\nPara [crear](https://medium.com/mintgate/announcing-token-protected-pages-23d917c37727) un **token gated access**, se necesitaban 3 pasos; el contenido que quieres proteger, con que token, y el mínimo requerido. Si era una colección de NFTs, podías hasta indicar unos ID específicos (solo el BAYC 2121, 3131 y 4141).\n\nUno de los primeros casos de uso que tuvimos fue una [página web](https://jnryfirst.com/firstaudio) con [$FIRST](https://twitter.com/harrisonfirst?s=20&t=Acv6zJNdotZ39aJpxuH23A) donde los miembros de la comunidad tenían acceso exclusivo a contenido de audio para usar en sus NFTs. De ahí empezamos a **tokenizar** **acceso** a una **playlist de Spotify, un artículo, videos o documentos en Google Drive para DAOs**. Desde que lanzamos nuestra plataforma, hemos tenido mas de **27.300 miembros** utilizando token gated links.\n\n**La utilidad es abierta** al creador o a la comunidad, **no hay límites**, cualquier contenido digital, se puede proteger y encriptar con un token, dando **seguridad a los miembros** y haciendo que el contenido sea **únicamente exclusivo para ellos**. Nosotros pusimos una herramienta sencilla, ellos crearon acceso a:\n\n* Trabajo (**Calendly, Zoom, Google Drive, Dropbox**)\n* IRL meet (**Formularios, RSVP, Tickets**)\n* Video (**Youtube, Vimeo**)\n* Música (**Spotify, SoundCloud, Audius**)\n* Web (**Dominio propio, Shopify**)\n\n![Experiencia token gated con los Golden State Warriors](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QsSTvq8joeQNyJspiHfLx.jpeg?height=694&width=1400)\n\nEn cuanto a comunidad, destacaría [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/). Es la **comunidad por referencia** en el ecosistema de social tokens. Hogar de muchas subculturas, FWB existe como un ecosistema de relaciones, un estudio creativo descentralizado y un grupo de chat interminable. Para leer su newsletter o acceder al discord necesitas tener una **cantidad mínima de tokens**.\n\n[Stoner Cats](https://www.stonercats.com/), fue sin duda un **siguiente paso en token gating**, creando una serie de animación para adultos (creada por Mila Kunis y Ashton Kutcher). Para poder ver cada nuevo episodio de la serie, es necesario **ser titular de uno de los NFT** de Stoner Cats.\n\nLos servicios token gated son especialmente **importantes** para los **creadores** y/o **marcas**, ya que les permiten centrarse en **ofrecer un buen servicio**, encontrar usuarios que quieran ese servicio, y centrarse en a**portar valor al usuario**. Esto es bueno para los usuarios, porque pueden **pagar menos y tener una mejor experiencia**. Es bueno para los creadores, porque pueden mantener sus negocios y **generar nuevas vías de monetización** al mismo tiempo, **creando una comunidad**. \n\nEs un nuevo modelo para **crear una comunidad fiel** y darles **beneficios** por formar parte de ella. Hasta **Shopify** ha introducido **Tokengated Experiences** hace unas semanas:\n\n[https://twitter.com/Shopify/status/1539610296200974338?s=20&t=LmgxEjqE4JFH2ZbfGTGLZw](https://twitter.com/Shopify/status/1539610296200974338?s=20&t=LmgxEjqE4JFH2ZbfGTGLZw)\n\n### Más allá de un acceso restringido\n\nRealmente, podemos ir más allá con gated access, no tiene que quedarse en un link, es difícil de distribuir y no es tan fácil monetizar de una manera directa. **Utilizarlo más allá de un sistema de verificación, implementando-lo directamente en un NFT**. Dar v**alor intrínseco** al token añadiendo contenido restringido.\n\nUn contenido exclusivo incrementa su valor en forma de NFT, pudiéndose vender directamente a una audiencia conservando todo el valor. Es como Patreon pero sin la plataforma, porque el **contenido puede vivir en cualquier lugar**. Es agnóstico a una plataforma, el contenido estará donde tú elijas.\n\n**Token gating es una forma de sobrecargar un NFT**, lo que otorga más valor a su propiedad. Además de poseer el contenido de un video NFT, eBook NFT, Ticket NFT o Link NFT, también puede garantizar que **solo sus propietarios puedan acceder** a ese contenido. Un ejemplo de ello fue mi presentación en ETHBarcelona, al acabar, todo el mundo que coleccionaba [mi NFT](https://tomu.mintgate.io/projects/cultura-tokenizada) tenia mi ppt gated, las diapositivas presentadas. Ese NFT no se ha quedado ahí, cualquiera que lo coleccione **tendrá acceso exclusivo a futuro contenido**. \n\nConvertir el contenido en un asset digital significa que se convierte en algo que el propietario puede revender. **No puedo revender mi suscripción**, pero puedo **revender un video NFT** que compré la semana pasada por más de lo que me costó, o incluso **prestarlo** mientras voy **generando un ingreso pasivo**.\n\n### Comunidades web3\n\nEsto es lo que hizo que toda comunidad tokenizada **tenga un sitio** donde **compartir** información, tener un chat protegido solo para aquellos que tienen un **token en particular**. Hace dos veranos fue cuando [Collab.land](https://collab.land/) surgió y domino los grupos de chat tanto en Telegram como en Discord. Cualquiera integraba sus servicios para crear un **canal exclusivo para holders**. Desde esos momentos, donde Collab.land se enfocaba en **chat** y MintGate en **contenido digital**, hemos visto que más y más plataformas han salido construyendo en este vertical. Si tengo que destacar dos de ellos, sin duda son:\n\n* [Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com/) - Control de acceso descentralizado para aplicaciones web3 y datos privados en un Internet abierto.\n* [Guild](https://guild.xyz/) - ‘Token-enabled membership’. Puedes crear niveles exclusivos en tu comunidad y administrarlos con diferentes tokens.\n\nAhora, ya nos **comunicamos** con gente que tiene el **mismo token**. O incluso, [lensfrens](https://www.lensfrens.xyz/) te enseña a quien seguir en base a tu huella en web3, en base a aquello que compartes con esa persona desde un punto de vista de token. **Conecta tu wallet, y descubres a qué comunidad perteneces**:\n\n* [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/) - una comunidad para cada token. Commonwealth es una plataforma todo en uno para que las comunidades discutan, voten y financien proyectos de manera colectiva.\n* [Backdrop](https://backdrop.so/)- ayudan a todo el mundo a participar en las comunidades tokenizadas de la web3. La verdad, perdemos demasiado tiempo en discord, esta es la manera de estar pendiente de todo lo que ocurre y dónde contribuir.\n\nYa no necesitamos generar 100 contraseñas para todas las páginas webs o apps que accedemos, ahora nos **conectamos** con **nuestra wallet** y **descubrimos** un n**uevo mundo**. Podemos diseñar comunidades más fieles, enfocadas en 100 fans que de verdad quieran contribuir y formar parte de **algo exclusivo**. \n\nUn token hace que decidamos donde **comunicarnos** con nuestra comunidad, darles la oportunidad de **participar** en el contenido, no depender de una plataforma y ofrecerles una **experiencia única**.\n\nTodo está ahí, a un clic de generar una nueva experiencia, una experiencia única, una **experiencia token gated**.", "timestamp": 1658152483, "digest": "JcObSsvZLUnM4L7MdP4ibMQGr7farY9y4IhlcZkzHSE", "contributor": "0x98397A068d413D3C92A506f98c5F25D33A9DAc14"}

OTC交易返点：持有一定数量的FTT的持币人，可以收到OTC交易返点。（FTX的OTC交易没有手续费。）\n5. OTC交易回购：FTX会根据OTC的交易额和收入进行一定程度的FTT回购和销毁。\n6. 持币用户分成：FTT的后台测试及上线模拟环境显示，在较大行情期间，FTT的风险保证金呈净增长，没有产生过分摊；部分风险准备金的净收入将作为分成给到FTT持有者。\n\n独特的模式：\nFTT 质押\n\n质押FTT将享有以下权益：\n增加邀请返佣比例: 通过质押FTT，邀请人将得到更高的返佣比例\n挂单手续费奖励: FTT质押者将获得挂单手续费奖励（原有的FTT手续费折扣会保持)\n额外投票权: 质押FTT将获得额外的投票权益 标准投票数量, 基于FTT持有数量和30天交易量决定)\n空投额外奖励: 质押FTT将获得更多的SRM空投（以及获得未来可能出现的其它空投奖励）\n免收区块链费用:持股人每天可以免费获得ERC20和ETH提款\n\nToken：ftt\n\n发行总量：335,165,027\n流通总量：139,295,691\n\n团队：FTT的团队阵容强大，创始人SBF被评为币圈最有影响力的30人之一，Mit物理系毕业。SBF本人作为90后业内的领军者本身对ftt就有着强大的加持。\n\n今年 4 月，SBF发推表示FTX交易量在去年一年上涨了8000%，在所有交易平台中增速最快。目前，FTX总体交易量位于行业第四，其中，衍生品依然是FTX的业务支柱。\n\n风险：庄家大户控盘比较严重，运营思路明确，所以操盘性质也十分明显。\n\n消息面评估：FTT DAO从Sam Bankman-Fried粉丝社区完成700万美元融资。该基金将为去中心化金融和加密教育领域的社区主导项目做出贡献。\n\nFtx和monumental\n\nSos\n\n基本面：\nOpensea作为全球最大的nft交易平台一直没有发放自己的代币，这其实引起了一些投资者的不满，这时openDAO的组织宣布发放代币SOS，并会以空投的形势发放给opensea用户，这是币圈一个全新的DAO形势，你不发放代币我直接DAO帮你发币，只要是在opensea做过交易的，它都会基于交易量像你的账户空投代币，\n\nToken：SOS\n\n代币分配： 50%用于空投opensea用户\n20%质押奖励\n20%社区基金\n10%lp奖励\n\n风险：典型看手速与判断的项目，早期介入可以赚得盆满钵满，三大上线基本属于买在山顶，极容易被割，以最近热点DAO宣传项目，却没有实际的应用价值。\n\nFTM\n\n基本面：\n\nFantom是一个高度可扩展的区块链平台，基于DAG（有向无环图分布式数据库）技术支持智能合约，适用于DeFi、cryptodApp、以及企业解决方案，意在通过使用Lachesis协议来突破“老牌”区块链设置的限制，与其它公链最大的区别，在于DAG技术带来的交易数据存储方式改变。\n\n在Fantom中，每一笔交易信息都可以生成单独的单元，单元和单元之间只需要进行相互任意连接验证，不用像一般区块链要把交易合并打包出块才算是完成交易，因而提高了交易并发量，实现了即时交易。\n\n同时，由于Fantom能够兼容以太坊EVM虚拟机，以太坊的DeFi应用可以一键平移到该公链上，享受该公链的低费率和高速交易。\n\nFantom通过桥接将各种链纳入其网络，例如以太坊、BSC、Polygon和Avalanche，以顺应未来的多链趋势。目前，SushiSwap和Curve等主要的以太坊项目都迁移到了Fantom，流量也一道引入。\n\n10月伊始，Fantom各项指标开始呈现快速增长态势。根据CoinMarketCap数据显示，Fantom的原生代币FTM年内涨幅已经超过12664%，即近乎130倍增长，排名目前位于第35位；根据DefiLlama数据显示，Fantom上DeFi的总锁定价值（TVL）约为98亿美元，较8月底的5亿美元增长近20倍。\n\n值得一提的是，Fantom还发布了针对数字人民币的CBDC解决方案，还宣布与塔吉克斯坦规模最大的银行之一OJSCOrienbank合作，为塔吉克斯坦建立中央银行数字货币（CBDC）系统，可见其在CBDC领域的雄心壮志。\n\n核心业务：\n比特币、以太坊等传统公链存在的一个问题是：节点越多，去中心化程度越高，但速度和扩展性也越差，而DAG则刚好相反，简单来说就是越多节点加入，速度就越快，扩展性也会变得无限大。\n\n实际上，曾经EOS、TRX等明星公链也曾尝试解决区块链不可能三角问题，但实际效果差强人意。例如号称百万TPS的EOS实测不过几千，并且安全性奇差，成为市场名头最响、表现最差的公链。\n\n而许多新型公链也尝试解决这个问题，例如主打金融公链的雪崩协议、开放网络NEAR等等，Fantom则采用了一种名为DAG的技术解决这个问题。\n\n融资情况：\n\nFantom团队的创新方案得到众多投资机构的支持，比如BlockVC、BlockCrafters、JRRCrypto、CryptoBazzar、连接资本、ZoraxCapital、TransferenceFund、节点资本、NirvanaCapital、DFund基金、丹华资本、回向区块链基金等。\n\n实际上，在创立不久的2018年上半年，Fantom就完成了预定的代币总供应量的40%的代币销售，通过种子轮以及两轮私募共筹集到4000万美元，投资方包括：\n\nHyperchainCapital、SignumCapital、8Decimal、ArringtonXRPCapital、BiboxFund、LinkVC、NirvanaCapital、JRRCrypto、BlockVC、中国私募股权基金九鼎投资（JDCapital）、KosmosCapital、Lemniscap、回向区块链基金（TransferenceBlockchainFund）等。\n\n在完成私募后，Fantom又通过公开销售筹集到265万美元。\n\n团队：Fantom最初由韩国开发者ByungIkAhn于2018年1月创立，官网列出的27位团队成员信息中，位于澳大利亚悉尼的MichaelKong现担任首席执行官兼首席信息官，其他成员包括工程师、科学家、研究人员、设计师和企业家。\n\nToken：FTM代币：总发行量为31.7亿枚，目前流通超过20亿+，目前，FTM 可用作原生主网代币、ERC-20 代币和 BEP-2 代币。", "timestamp": 1658152830, "digest": "3qRvY9oBiM8aQFPWVCLX2m6VSSGTIXGId86Mh2RYSKY", "contributor": "0x97d2F391Ef469b556eA0EAbeb44E3d89DC58458F"}

Also, the content is ours, not mirror's, and they use decentralized servers like Arweave (which I'll talk about later) so that the information is eternal.\n\n**Lens Protocol**: This project is focused on identity, data portability and the social. They created the social layer 0 that allows developers to invent applications that run on this blockchain/protocol and that, for example, we can switch between applications while maintaining full control of our preferences, privacy, and our connections (friends). The next Twitter, Instagram or Facebook will be built on Lens, but unlike current business models, they will not be able to exploit our information for advertising or invent vicious algorithms to keep us looking at the screen.\n\nI talk more about Lens in my other note on identity.\n\n**BAT**: Basic Attention Token is an initiative of the Brave browser that was invented by Brendan Eich who is none other than the inventor of JavaScript, Mozilla and Firefox. Brave is a browser that blocks all third-party cookies (Google Ads, etc.) that spy on our behavior in order to offer us invasive advertising. By blocking all tracheas we become invisible to corporations that want to exploit our information, and on top of that browsing is faster because you don't have to load all the JavaScript for these cookies.\n\nBut in order not to leave advertisers out, Brave offers incentives in the BAT token for those who wish to receive advertising voluntarily, let's say. So you browse, you are aware that you are giving information to advertisers and in exchange for that, you receive advertising. A win-win, or at least a fairer, logical and less extractive way. At least we get something.\n\n**OpenSea**: OpenSea is the leading marketplace for NFT exchanges. It is the easiest to understand what it is for because it is as if it were an Amazon or MercadoLibre, something that already exists, but unlike web2 marketplaces, OpenSea publishes the content of our wallets, it does not own our information. We can choose to publish them on OpenSea or quickly go to a competitor. It is as if we had an NFT of our MercadoLibre publications and we could change the platform whenever we wanted.\n\nGiven the portability of the data, OpenSea is open source, since it does not gain anything by not being open source, on the contrary, it is a competitive advantage to be open source in crypto rather than not. If you are open source and open, others can join you, allowing you to maintain your leadership position. OpenSea charges 2.5% also because it is what the market allows, otherwise a competitor that charges less can easily appear.\n\n**Arweave**: It is a network similar to IPFS+Filecoin, but under this system eternal storage is guaranteed. Due to the logic of this blockchain, the miners who receive the $AR (Arweave) token must be able to demonstrate access to random content/file at all times in order to validate new transactions. This forces the miners to continue to keep copies of the old files because otherwise they cannot continue mining.\n\nI talk more about decentralized storage in this note\n\n**ENS**: Ethereum Name Service is like a router from blockchain addresses (wallets) to names in text format, with .eth at the end. The project lets you register a domain, like a .com, but an .eth, and assign the wallet to which it corresponds. More similar to how an alias works, but this alias is yours and you can assign the wallet you need to it.\n\nENS is also an open-source protocol and is run entirely by the ENS DAO where every change or improvement is voted on. The domains have an annual cost, but they do this so that no one abuses the system and that those who use it have the opportunity to use them. Also everything generated is donated to charity, so ENS is a non-profit organization.\n\n**Metamask**:", "timestamp": 1658152956, "digest": "V-0vmCNAebsyV4YbvznnNFNjwbAO_ZwqAmj7-DftKko", "contributor": "0x7E0b0363404751346930AF92C80D1fef932Cc48a"}

Hunting the darkhorses of the Crypto world.**\n\n# 概要：\n\n* 本周CPI大幅超越预期，市场一度认为会加息100BP，美联储及美国政府及时放风加息75BP稳住了市场预期，美股和币市迎来了大幅反弹，并可能持续到加息后，转为中期反弹行情。\n* 油价虽大幅下跌，但因增产无望，可能还是高位震荡，所以CPI即使已经见顶回落，但恐怕也难以有较大的降低，但毕竟给了市场一个喘息的机会，可以暂时放下加息压力。\n* 同时市场有人预测，美联储将在年底前结束加息，并转为重新宽松，否则美国无力承担，这将有利于风险资产上涨。\n* BTC、ETH带动市场大幅反弹，价值山寨币将获得难得的交易机会，不要错过。\n\n# 0、本周市场重大事件\n\n### 宏观经济与政策\n\n* 本周公布6月份CPI 9.1%，超过预期值8.8%，创40年新高，核心CPI 5.9%，前值6%，并未新高，随后美股开盘大跌；然后拜登表示，油价已下降，CPI已过时；本周油价最低90，收盘在100，预示着7月CPI将会回落；本周美元指数再创新高触及109，主要因日元和欧元下跌。\n* CPI超预期导致市场猜测可能会加息100BP，随后美联储通过多个渠道发布消息，加息75BP，市场闻讯大幅反弹；另外周五美零售销售数据和密歇根消费者信心指数均好于预期，打消了市场衰退担忧，有助于美股反弹，且传统行业好于科技行业。\n* 拜登与沙特未达成石油增产协议，油价恐怕还要继续维持高位，通胀可能已经到顶，但明显下降也难。\n* 但市场也有不同声音：宏观数据分析公司Forest For The Trees的CEO Luke Gromen认为，美联储将在未来3个月结束加息并重回量化宽松政策，而欧美将在未来5-10年迎来持续的高通胀；如果继续加息，美债利息将继续增加，而受加息影响GDP将降低，并导致税收减少，美国财政更无力负担利息，债务/GDP将很快到达130%的风险线；冬季俄罗斯能源对欧日更是不可替代的，加重西方国家压力；没有唯一的选择就是重新宽松，避免美债违约。而黄金和比特币将脱离美股走强；[原文链接](https://www.theblockbeats.info/news/31277)。\n* BIMEX创始人Arthur Hayes表示，预测美联储将再次向金融市场注入数万亿美元，增加市场流动性，将带动加密货币在内的风险资产触底反弹，正密切关注日欧元走势。\n* 据coinHub推文，美国国土安全部成员在SEC会议上表示，美国政府知道谁是中本聪，是一个4人团队。可信度恐怕不高。\n* 美联储沃勒表示，去中心化金融最终可能会改变传统金融市场，催化了DeFi的反弹。\n\n### 传统资本\n\n* 纽约洋基棒球队允许员工将部分薪资转为比特币。\n* 清崎表示，正持有现金等待买入比特币。\n* 贝莱德CEO表示，公司的机构投资者对加密货币有更多兴趣。\n\n### Crypto新闻事件\n\n* 摩根大通表示，比特币的电力成本已从6月初的24000美元降低至了现在的约13000美元，主要是矿工部署了更多高效率的矿机。受Celsius破产影响，比特币矿机价格跌至2020年以来低点。\n* 以太坊合并预计在9月19日实施，将减产90%，考虑燃烧消耗可能进入通缩，预测质押率从10%提高到30%，受此影响ETH大涨，相关Staking赛道项目LDO、SSV涨幅更大。\n* Celsius宣布破产，因Terra、3AC等坏账导致亏空12亿美元，十万用户受损。\n* AEX暂停平台所有业务，全力配合警方调查。\n* 币安发布五周年公开信，有客户1.2亿，希望成为Web3门户，为数十亿人迈入加密新世界的第一步的工具集；币安报告显示，截止6月有1551款加密游戏。\n\n### Glassnode周报概要\n\n* 今年的2.9万美元相当于2018年的6000美元，而近期的17600美元低点相当于2018年的3000美元；\n* 2018年大批买家在6000美元买入，而被迫在3000美元的底部卖出，完成最终的换手；今年同样大批买家在3W买入，而在近期的2W区域卖出，又一次财富再分配完成；\n* 长期持有者卖出利润率（LTH-SOPR）为0.67，即亏损33%卖出；长期持有者持有成本相比现价浮亏14%；前者＞后者说明目前投降卖出者以2020年以后买入者为主，而2020年以前更老的HODL并未卖出；而历史上此两指标同时出现亏损的持续时间，2014年熊市为11个月，2018年熊市为6个月，（参照此前比例推算，此次持续时间可能是3个月）；\n* 熊市的底部就是比特币从信念薄弱者转移到坚定信仰者的过程；而目前刚买入的比特币正在从短期持有转为长期持有；\n* 鉴于成本支出压力，矿工们正在投降加快卖出比特币，已持续1个月，2018年底矿工投降时间持续4个月。\n*

\\~一年以上持有量占比：64.88%\n\n* 本周本指标几乎无波动。\n\n### \\~储备风险Reserve Risk：0.00109\n\n* 本指标又反弹回0.001，上周创历史新低。\n\n### 1.1.2、BTC中长期指标\n\n### \\~200周均线：跌破\n\n* 跌破200周均线，堪比历史上历次熊市大底。\n\n### \\~已实现价格：跌破\n\n* 自6月13日跌破已实现价格以来，到7月18日第一次站上已实现价格，共在其下34天。2018年底熊市为136天，312为7天。\n* 已实现价格=所有的币最后一次移动时的市值总和/当前流通总市值，即可视为所有币的平均成本，包含最远古几乎零成本的币，所以当币价跌破已实现价格时，说明币价严重低估，如果价格可以站稳则这次加仓良机已经过去。\n\n### \\~Ahr999囤币&x指数：0.326，抄底区间\n\n* 囤币指数本次下跌最低点0.24，2018年大底极值0.26，312时极值0.2。\n* 目前0.326，低于0.45，依然处于抄底区间。\n\n### \\~2-Year乘数通道：大幅跌破\n\n* 大幅跌破2-Year乘数通道，堪比2018年底和312。\n\n### \\~梅耶倍数（Mayer Multiple）：反弹出超卖价\n\n* 本轮下跌极限低值0.478，超过2018年和312。\n* 目前0.585，刚反弹会0.55以上，从市场超卖状态进入看跌通道。\n\n### \\~公允价值偏差量（MVRV Z-Score）：-0.119\n\n* 本轮最低-0.195，低于0.3即为严重低估，2018年极值-0.5，312极值-0.26。\n* 目前-0.119，依然处于严重低估状态。\n\n### \\~交易所余额及占比：有所增加\n\n* 根据链数查数据，本周CEX余额由12.48%增加到12.56%，增加15570枚，随12日开始的反弹而增加。\n\n## 1.2、短期指标及期货市场数据\n\n### \\~恐慌贪婪指数：15\\~24\n\n* 本周恐慌指数为15\\~24，终于全周都在15以上，但还在24以下，依然处于严重恐慌状态。\n* 从5月9日跌到15以下，到7月5日回到15以上，连续达57天，超过历史上历次熊市底部。\n\n### \\~期货资金费率：低正值\n\n* 本周资金费率，全部为正，但数值不大，在零附近波动。\n\n### \\~期货持仓量：小幅增加\n\n* BTC合约，小幅增加；ETH合约，增加略大些。\n\n### \\~期货爆仓量：略大，ETH空头为主\n\n* 本周ETH行情波动较大，爆仓以ETH空头为主。\n\n### \\~期货多空比：总体维持平衡\n\n### \\~期货成交量：略微放大\n\n### \\~看跌/看涨期权：BTC 0.61，ETH 0.32\n\n* ＜1，表示看跌为主，＞1，表明看涨为主，数值偏离1越大，表明倾向性越强；\n* 此数值表明看涨ETH的意愿强于BTC。\n\n## 1.3、BTC走势分析及总结\n\n* 本周行情小幅波动，开盘价20846，最低点18900，最高点21665，收盘价20793，周中公布了超预期高的CPI后，市场短暂下跌，而后开始了4天的反弹行情，表明市场对CPI数据已经开始免疫，目前价格对超高通胀及预期的加息已经Price in。\n* 从周线看，目前依然受制于周线MA200，从目前美联储观察数据可以看出，7月27日加息75BP是大概率，则比特币有望跟随美股反弹站上MA200，按本周收盘价MA200=22630。\n\n## 1.4、全市场分析\n\n### \\~全市场周数据\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gSRLl4yGlRBR2uRE--I99.png?height=334&width=678)\n\n* 因ETH2.0将于9月10日合并利好影响，ETH一枝独秀，大涨15%，而BTC和其他ALT基本未动，并导致市占率BTCDOM下降。\n\n# 2、关注ALT项目\n\n## 2.1、Top20手续费收入排行\n\n* 综合考虑Crypto Fees及Token Terminal的数据做如下分析，因部分协议的收入未明确归属TokenHolders，所以后两者有所差别。\n* 收入较高，增长教明显的协议为UNI、dYdX、LDO、SNX、AAVE、LOOKS、GMX、ENS、CRV、HNT。\n* UNI也受益ETH利好，且将推出NFT市场，近期Uniswap日平均交易费超过ETH网络，并上线Robinhood。\n* LDO直接受益于ETH合并预期利好，收入大增；dYdX、SNX、GMX、AAVE、LOOKS的收入较大比例归属TokenHolders，受益更加明显。\n* AAVE新提案与BAL交换20万枚BAL。\n\n### Crypto Fees数据\n\n![资源来源：Crypto fees](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uf5314dL5jOgJ0zQA5oFD.png?height=1060&width=1278)\n\n### 协议收入-来自Token Terminal数据\n\n![资源来源：token terminal](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/47dx1Ebt9sR_gi8-KPEOQ.png?height=545&width=1106)\n\n### TokenHolders的协议收入-来自Token Terminal数据\n\n![资源来源：token terminal](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l4zCbh-raf8HrCjgxeXwm.png?height=555&width=1100)\n\n## 2.2、公链生态\n\n* 本周公链生态最大利好就是明确ETH 2.0合并的时间为9月19日，合并后，通胀将实际变为通缩，并可能带动更多币加入POS节点，减少流通量。之前周报提过，本次大跌中ETH的链上清算可以类比312对于即将减半的BTC，达到了彻底洗盘的目的，可以更顺畅的基于利好而上涨。\n* 受此消息带动staking赛事的LDO、SSV暴涨，220403周报曾对此有过分析，可以参考；OP、MATIC也跟随大涨。\n* MATIC最近的建设比较积极，如收购和合作推进，并将于7月21日推出zkEVM，为开发者和用户提供EVM等效解决方案、高性能zk证明机制（zk-proofs）与以太坊主网级别的安全性。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X_4czWsSInbkt7BMb498b.png?height=496&width=1106)\n\n##

{"id": "jbG3WEZ7fgHDvLNi_CVeoZJCXfqTBRFgG6WCBh3j6K4", "title": "Web3 academy", "body": "“The age of Web3 is coming!”, “The Web3 arms race is upon us”. These are just few of the headlines that came along in 2022 so far. Is this just a new hype that has been unleashed or could Web3 really become a technology revolution? Via a series of articles, Tech Lab will explain more about Web3, what is it, how does it work, what can it do, and what are the main challenges ahead.\n\nSo, what is Web3? Let’s firsthave a look at Web2. Because if there is a Web3, there must be a Web2, right? Web2 is the internet as we know it today. One of the main characteristics of Web2 is that information, web applications, platforms and services are centralised. If we want to participate in the Web2 world, we are forced to share our data and identity with organisations like Meta and Google, with very little control over what happens with that data and identity. \n\nOne of the main tasks of Web3 is to shift the power over data and identity towards the owner or initiator of the data. By organising the internet in a decentralised way,data can be stored anywhere,also thanks to blockchain administering data control, ownership, as well asuring data privacy through encryption. This is why Web3 is also called decentralized internet or decentralized web. \n\nWhen you hear people talking about Web 3.0 (instead of Web3) they could also mean something else, namely the semantic web. Both Web3 and Web 3.0 want to offer an alternative to the current web,but they have a different focus. The semantic web (Web 3.0)focuses on efficiency and intelligence,and works by reusing and linking data across websites. The decentralized web (Web3)focuseson empowerment and security,by giving power over data and identity back to the people.\n\nSo, when you read something online about the subject, how can you really distinguish the two concepts? Well, apparently you cannot be 100% sure. The fact that there is still no consensus about the definition of Web3 is part of the challenge.

*为什么Web3应用程序无法形成飞轮效应滚滚向前？*\n>\n> *虽然有这么多灵魂拷问，但现实的情况却是几乎没人停下思考：理想的去中心化设计和现实的应用生态建设之间有怎样的鸿沟？*\n\nWeb3带给我们产业迭代、时代变迁乃至社会进化的宏大愿景，可谓一个伟大而冒险、自上而下的顶层社会变革设计。作为加密世界建构的思想图腾和行动纲要，Web3的去中心化社会理念具有革命性——过往社会变革往往是自上而下设计，并带来不断反复和冲突；在去中心化社会理念下，Web3的社会实践却呈现以自下而上“涌现”，类似蚁群或蜂巢的“自组织”系统。\n\n可是从现实层面来讲，Web3缺失落地实践的执行者和推动者。虽然任何一次与社会变革关联的重大技术都脱离不了市场、财富、利益的蕴化与赋能，但加密世界的发展史却完全被财富欲望所穿透，上至项目开发者、工作室、投资机构，下至投机者、hodler等所有加密生态主要参与者。\n\n以自下而上的Web3应用生态建设来支撑的产业迭代、时代变迁和社会进化，与加密世界币圈的各方利益博弈，让这一切陷入了“悖论”。\n\n### **VC：Web3背后的隐形推手**\n\n> 以Token之手，以建设为名\n\n现有互联网产业架构说到底还是“规模换增长，流量换估值”的线性关系；但Web 3不存在中心载体，不能用以往估值逻辑来评价投入产出比。Web 3所有的商业模型和产品设计都需要重构，由一个非线性关系来打破临界点，并达到相当规模的用户数量——这种模式可以类比于人类大脑通过各种神经突触相互链接，最终产生复杂思维。\n\n这种去中心化的重构代表个人与企业的分野将逐渐缩小，每个人、每个小微企业，甚至任何社会团体的商业价值都可以被挖掘（Token），被传输（Web 3社交），并且相互间的关系可迁移（社交图谱）、可存储（IPFS）。\n\n但是，现阶段Web 3.0存在的问题明显:\n\n**1. 缺乏真实使用需求挖掘：**\n\nWeb 3.0主要靠抄Web 2.0的创意，频繁推出各类中心化服务的去中心化版本，缺乏对用户真实需求的挖掘。比如，我们不是想要一个去中心化版的Twitter，我们只是想要一个能保留社交关系、内容可NFT化、平台抗审查，并且可以保护我们隐私的社交协议。\n\n**2. 用户以谋利为第一动力：**\n\n用户不是出于使用价值和真实场景使用产品，而是以谋利为目的，这也是X2E及其仿盘项目层出不穷的原因。但是这种模式只能在创业阶段吸引到淘金者，不会留下真实的用户群体。\n\n如果要坚定做多Web 3，没有长期投入无法看到回报，至少需要商业模型成型才可以得到果实。只有诞生出全民应用的时候，才是Web 3真正破局的时候。但我们不得不接受的现实是：DeFi用户大概400万人，NFT在OpenSea活跃用户约为50万，Web 3社交协议大概不到1万用户。\n\n为什么Web 3实际用户规模如此小——因为VC助推下的Token机制。\n\nVC在Web 2的逻辑是：持续投资，寻求单一赛道的垄断地位，占据全部市场空间，持续获得超额利润。\n\nVC在Web 3的逻辑是：以投资为筹码，寻求早期廉价Token，以二级市场为抛售地，以代币上交易所为节点，快速榨干token价值。\n\nWeb 3的Token机制成为机构和VC的蓄水池，并且不用负任何责任。这里存在一个Bug机制，让传统机构可以利用Token攻击套利。\n\n为什么Token机制无法带来实际用户规模？理性人认为：有些行为并不是在市场机制下的自发行为，恰恰是被人为干涉和创造出来的。\n\n用户使用搜索引擎，可能确实会在乎隐私、数据安全这些内容，但最重要的是满足对搜索的需求，这是Web 3建设路径不能等同于DeFi和NFT的根本原因，一个产品使用价值应该优先于价格机制。\n\n比如用户使用EthSign进行商业合同的签署，最看重的是合同的不可篡改性，这是Web 3产品优于其他工具的核心优势，用户完全不需要了解上链和智能合约意味著什么，但是可以知晓这可以让合同进行永久存档。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/f070d016203c45aae37b729920c6cedd.jpg)\n\n图源：EthSign\n\n众所周知，市场是基于个人利益最大化的基础去行动的，但目前的市场是基于他人的利益最大化在起舞——这根逗猫棒叫做Token。让我们用一张图片来看看这个Token加持下的演化流程。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/8600a98ddb3bb4bf75883719655b6846.jpg)\n\n机构谈好分成，项目方在内部回报率（IPR）的引诱下，双方合谋维持币价，牛市时会获得更多的用户支撑Token的价值，但一旦熊市由于项目缺乏核心用户会面临币价和用户的双重流失。\n\nToken被利用完毕之后，部分项目方会选择一起抛售，或者无可奈何维持运转，比如Uniswap在收购NFT聚合交易平台Genie以后，竟然以USDC作为回溯空投币种，而非使用Uni代币，可以宣告治理代币的事实性死亡。\n\n在中本聪的设想中，Token是工作量证明的一种表现形式。但是在VC的指挥下，项目的意义是为了Token的价格，机构和项目针对Token的策略是快速退出的渠道，而非维护项目运营发展的关键所在。\n\n### **空壳：从基础设施到应用场景**\n\n从基础设施到应用场景的空壳化结构蛀空了Web 3的发展脊柱。\n\n当我们在谈论Web 3时，涉及有关这一主旨的全部概念——从社交图谱、创作者经济到SaaS和协作工具，似乎已经全部完备，只待一声令下，Web 3就会迅速占据网络世界成为基础设施。但实际上什么都没有——CloudFlare一崩溃，预言机停止吟诵，交易所无法撮合……\n\n我们猛地发现，在Web 3的概念之下，在底层公链的支撑下，原来还有更底层的互联网协议在运作。在Web3的宏大愿景之下，我们可以发现目前横亘在理想和实践的差距：Web 3只是个空壳。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/034928510a6dd30457f10c24ae7dbc3e.jpg)\n\nWeb 3的底层仍旧是传统基础设施\n\n没有一个现象级的应用的现实，Web 3生态的飞轮效应就无法滚动起来。比如，目前社交协议主打SocialFi或者社交图谱概念，受到追捧的BBS Network，其50%的代币将会分发给活跃用户。那么活跃度如何提升呢？当然是制造“高质量”信息，在此逻辑下，有更多流量导入，跟随者、订阅者的活跃用户就会收获更多利益。这种机制来自于对DeFi中交易挖矿的模仿，人为鼓噪出足够的泡沫，最后留下一地鸡毛。\n\n目前我们只有Web 3对Web 2的拙劣模仿，可是我们需要做到保护隐私、数据可携带、社交可迁移等特质，就需要区块链、DeFi、NFT的参与，这才是有真实的使用需求的应用。\n\n![解析「Web3悖论」的内在机理与突破路径](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/007954a2b92128e9867684265c13212a.jpg)*解析「Web3悖论」的内在机理与突破路径*\n\n主流开发者涌入交易所等现金流充裕的赛道所使用的语言基本是Java、Go、Javascript等，而只有在涉及链上交互部分才会使用Rust、solidity等。如果他们认识不到Web 3的伟大意义，那么蓝图无人施工，永远无法成真。为什么Web 3应用会缺乏真实的使用需求？——道理很简单，因为产品不好用。这背后是因为优质开发者极度稀缺导致的。Web 3生态表面上稀缺的是用户，但以目前的Web 3使用者数万量级来计算，探索性应用都较少，仍旧需要更多技术性、基础性开发工具的建设。\n\n在熊市到来之际，coinbase、bybit甚至会进行裁员，这些开发者会重新流失，进一步恶化Web 3开发力量。在区块链的世界里，优质开发者对新工具、新技术的带动力量是巨大的，但目前的态势是将他们在挤出Web 3基础设施开发领域。Web 3生态可以说是万事俱备，但缺人才东风。\n\n### **未来：谁是躬身入局者？**\n\n我们简要概括Web 2/3之间的关系——希望我们可以管中窥豹，探索Web 3的未来图景。\n\n\\- 基础硬件目前一致：依旧是桌面端和移动端。Meta的VR设备并未与区块链技术或者链游产生直接联系，GameFi主要还是网页端和客户端为主并未广泛接入VR等设备，这是一个被有意无意忽略的一个关键点。VR设备还在铺设更广泛的使用路径。\n\n\\- 底层协议正在分化：网络底层并未完全抛弃HTTP、浏览器、TCP/IP等协议，但是UX/UI正在变化，美丑暂且不论，反正都以“赛博朋克”为主要取向，换句话说，公链作为通信协议，与IPFS作为数据库的模式并未完全取代现有的通信协议和中心化数据库。\n\n\\- 目前的Web 3.0以概念为主：互联网＋再进化-->Web 3.0+，如果这是必然发生的故事，那么就可以认为Web 3.0概念作为营销本身就是一种向现实世界的延伸。\n\n\\- 产品仍在迭代研发进程中：Web 3产品的生命周期不再固定化，会进入一个充满流动性的时代：用完即走服务也可以代币化和NFT化——本质上，门票用过一次不再使用，营销服务也可以用完即止，只要在于买卖双方达成共识，可以称为Token即服务。\n\n只是，这还需要一个过程实现，现在谈论Web 3.0的主要有三类人：\n\n**第一类：传统互联网大厂从业者**\n\n现在他们在跃跃欲试，主要是因为传统的流量模式已经到头了，在集体内卷的大厂中，已经有人准备驶入新航道，但是他们不改变思维的话，就会如同Facebook的Libra，或者所谓的联盟链技术一样。\n\n**第二类：crypto native**\n\n这类人或起步于公链，如Flow开始标榜自己是Web 3公链，或起步于DeFi/NFT/Metaverse项目组织，或是从大厂、机构中跳出来参与到Web 3的建设中。他们是目前最主力人群，如同开发Lens Protocol的Aave团队一样，大家都要学会拥抱变化。\n\n**第三类：传销的变种**\n\n传销的本质是产品模型在本质上无法盈利，在实操上均以拉人头为主的融资运营模式。此类人群不会对产品建设产生真正的兴趣，但他们往往声量最大，希望能尽可能拉拢人群参与其中，普通人在被骗后就会产生“Web 3＝骗局”的刻板印象。\n\n只有第二类人群成为主力，并且在未来有更多不同类型的人们进入到这个神奇的空间，发挥人类聪慧的大脑，创造出真正有价值的产品服务和使用场景。\n\nWeb 3的适应速度是超快的，要相信新产品模型的迭代速度，比如Nansen已经和Google Cloud合作提供实时市场数据。这就像是打不过就加入，Web 2和Web 3之间并不是隔绝的，而更像是双生子，Web 3给Web 2也留下了适应进化的时间。\n\n双方能达成合作的契合点在于，“Nansen 表示，数据将帮助做市商、对冲基金经理和资管经理训练他们的算法来预测市场走势、生成报告、指标等。”当新趋势成型，更多的主流群体就会参与其中，这是好的开端。\n\n我们会在接下来谈谈未来的Web 3产品究竟会长什么样——产品是Web 3能否重构下一代互联网的最基本的载体。认知是我们的灵魂，产品是我们的实体。最终，“Web3悖论”的突破路径还是要从开发者为加密生态提供用户可用的产品开始。\n\n敬请期待下篇。\n", "timestamp": 1658153634, "digest": "P6UWMVd-9QS4atPm2zkJa3-u3WM6luvntoQpwSQwWRo", "contributor":

In a broader sense, *Crisis* is an ongoing multi-media, multi-level experiment that explores alternative ideas for the distribution and exploitation of musical works. It is the journey of an album that defied the dominant structures of its system in order to break new ground.\n\nThis project aims to align *releases* ↔︎ *value* ↔︎ *community* into one common narrative. Read more about the process below.\n\n## The Story \\[Season 00\\]\n\nOne year ago the journey of Crisis began with the release of *[Crisis (The Worthless Album)](https://open.spotify.com/album/7nwbv2tj8q9OTWhin3ZBsm).* What was been planned as a traditional release, changed due to a pivotal decision.\n\nThe album was cut into 30 pieces, each 29 seconds long. Since a stream only starts counting after 30 seconds of playtime, it can't collect plays or earn any revenue, no matter how much it's listened to. The value of this album is 0.000$\n\nUltimately, this is the only way to choose one's own value in the current system of being patronised by a pro-rata system (streaming) of big tech and major labels. By releasing an album this way, it reveals quite the imbalance and absurdity of the music industry's current monetisation model and asks if centralised platforms should define the value of art according to a demand-supply calculation. Or, instead, shall creators regain complete control over the value they create.\n\n> \"*Valentin Hansen released an album in a way that’s never been done before.

To put it more simply, we will distribute ownership of *Crisis* during 9+ seasons.\n\nTherefore, the original album was minted as one piece of music on [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/valentinhansen/crisis-the-album-).\n\nOwnership of this NFT will be represented by each season's tokens (editions of NFTs), with 50% of the shares being transferred within the first nine seasons. Additionally, each season represents the album in its current form. As seasonal NFTs are collected, the album starts to change visually, sonically, & experientially until that particular season sells out.\n\nUpon sellout, a new season unlocks, shape- shifting the album once more and unlocking further experiences, products, visuals, etc.\n\nThe remaining 50% will be allocated in season 10. This way—when the album becomes the most expensive work of music ever sold—it'll be fully owned by the community that helped it reach this status.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iIhgeVic-qPXG15O8qcM5.jpg?height=2589&width=2767)\n\nThe journey will continue as long as people keep unlocking the next chapter.

{"id": "t-2hziXaZIqqTDTs4o8Mn3z6YIhGFP1z3mSKHplgAd8", "title": "DAOs, Agency, and Control Society (Part 1)", "body": "@Zayn_R001\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn July 2021, with the approval of the Wyoming Secretary of State’s office, the American CryptoFed became the first legally recognized decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in the United States (Pongratz, 2021). This news made the headline of that week, raising widespread attention on DAO, on what it means and why it matters. DAO is an emergent technologybased on the invention and development of blockchain. The first DAO appeared only in 2016 with the name “TheDAO” (DuPont, 2017). Despite its collapse after hackers steal more than $50 million from its users, “TheDAO” has inspired a boom in a variety of new DAOs. To link DAOs with a broader social context, we are currently undergoing a transformation from web2.0 (platform economy) to web3.0 (token economy) in which DAO, with its unique properties, may serve a crucial role. This essay will first give a definition on the concept of DAOs as well as some fundamentally related concepts such as blockchain technology. Subsequently, Under the theme of social movement, I will take DAO as a technological practice to demonstrate how its agency can change the way people communicate and collaborate, and empowers decentralized communities and individuals against centralized power. Finally, explanation on how it can be a tool to accelerate the transformation of our society to the Deleuzian conception of a “*control society*” will also be given.\n\n \n\nDefinition of DAO\n\nBefore defining DAO, an explanation of the mechanism of blockchain technology must be given since DAOs are fundamentally built upon blockchains. Essentially, blockchains are lists of records, called *blocks*, that are linked together into a *chain* using cryptography (Acharjamayum et al., 2016, p. 609), and each block contains the records from previous blocks in an encrypted code. This makes the data on blockchain impossible to be modified once a *block* is linked to the *chain*. In other words, Blockchains can only be added, but not altered. Based on blockchain technology, there emerged the institutional technology called “*Decentralized Autonomous Organizations*” (DAOs). According to Hassan & De Filippi (2021, p. 2), a DAO is a “blockchain-based system that enables people to coordinate and govern themselves by a set of self-executing rules deployed on a public blockchain, and whose governance is decentralized.” In simple words, a DAO is an organization of people who communicate with each other via a “network protocol”. The network protocols are the rules and laws of DAOs, defined using smart contracts written by codes and stored on blockchains.These rules are self-executed by computers, independent from central control and unable to be modified (De Filippi & Wright, 2018, p. 146). As Buterin (2013, p. 23) states, DAO aims to replicate a traditional company or nonprofit by using only cryptographic blockchain technology for enforcement. DAOs are not managed by boards, but are governed solely by community participants with highly participatory processes. Members of DAO participate in the decision-making and maintenance of the DAOs. They are less hierarchical and usually more democratic.  “Wages” in DAOs, often in the form of token (cryptocurrencies), are distributed with a community reward mechanism. The more active one member participates in the community, the more token he or she will get.  In short, a DAO is a transparent organization built on blockchains, controlled by participants and not influenced by central institutions. \n\n \n\nDAOs’ Agency\n\nMost technologies are perceived to be under the control of human since they are the creation of humanity. However, agency, a “power and ability to do something”, is not the monopoly of human, technologies themselves are also able to affect human intention through their own agency (Slake & Wise, 2014, pp. 139-140). From a cultural deterministic perspective, people use the technology of DAO to achieve their intention of decentralized autonomy in several fields. By writing different rules in smart contracts, DAOs can be used for different functions such as a crowd-funding platform, a content-sharing platform, a fully automated company, or an automated decision-making machine (Hassan & De Filippi, 2021, p. 5). Yet this is not an accurate and comprehensive interpretation of DAO. Instead of inactively serving as a tool, DAO has its unique agency to actively promote change and progress. To illustrate, because the rules and laws of DAOs are written in the forms of codes and stored in unmodifiable blockchains self-executed by computational programs, the chances of any participants to commit scam or malfeasance are eliminated by making it fundamentally impossible in a technological way. This diminishes the need for continuous monitoring to detect scams or other insider misuses and thereby increases efficiency (Wright, 2021). Therefore, trust and consensus become easier to be established across members of DAOs since they must obey the rules once enter the community, which makes possible for an organization to be managed in a self-running, self-governing, and self-evolving manner that can achieve the maximum effectiveness and fairness of the organization. In other words, this agency of DAOs provides a new method of organizational supervision and law-making system in which no judges are needed and levels of subjectivity in regulation can be reduced to minimum.\n\nIn a broader social context, we are currently in a society dominated by centralized power. With the development and dominance of user-generated content (UGC), companies such as Twitter, YouTube, and WeChat have gained great success. Users create content on those platforms and companies take these contents as products for sale. For no doubt, this kind of economy has been a great achievement. Yet there are problems with the current economic model. To illustrate with the example of WeChat, when we register a WeChat account, we need to provide our real names, phone numbers, and bank accounts to WeChat as to “authenticate” our identities. Yet this causes the private information of users to be controlled by these companies and to be continuously facing the risk of information leakage. A famous example is the Facebook scandal in 2014 that 87 million users’ information was revealed in use of political advertising (Tuttle, 2018). This demonstrates how a centralized organization may be a threat to the privacy of individual users. In a hierarchical structure, centralized power can easily gather our information and contents of our creation for sale, and to accumulate their own wealth. DAOs as a form of technology, have the agencies to empower individuals to protect themselves against the exploitation of centralized institutions. To specify, in a DAO where no central organization exists, no one member can gain the access to the information of all community members. Besides, thanks to the use of cryptography in blockchain, users can be anonymous since IP addresses are encoded using cryptography. DAO participants only need a crypto wallet address to identify themselves. Therefore, even there is an attempt to steal personal information, it is technologically difficult to achieve. Hence the risk of privacy leakage can largely be reduced. In other words, the agency of DAO can empower us to regain control by protecting our privacy from the misuse of personal information and shifting power from centralized companies back to communities and individuals.Similar scenarios can also be found in the arena of business and finance. In a business world dominated by centralized banks, the usage of money is not transparent. To specify, when an individual deposits money to his or her bank account to gain interest, there is no way to know where the money goes and how it has been used. DAOs as a new form of institution can be a perfect solution to this problem by providing full transparency for trades. Every transaction made through DAOs can always be spotted on the blockchain. This builds up the traceability of individual assets. Although the implication has just begun, a lot of research has been conducted focusing on building decentralized exchanges (Lin et al., 2019) that operate on DAOs. The rules of transaction, written in codes and stored on blockchains, can function automatically with full transparency as the records of transactions will be listed on the new block that adds itself to the existing chain. Thus, the agency of blockchain and DAOs make transparent trades possible. Overall, it can be concluded that in multiple fields, the use of DAOs can be regarded as an active agent to decentralize and democratize our society by protecting individuals from centralized institutions.\n\n ", "timestamp": 1658154627, "digest": "aiiguvh-d1IFwcQUMDltmhUBVRAJICxCbo8id9gUZDc", "contributor": "0x41D8FE5D5A62e455C8cd33bDee8ecE7D4eA6aaCb"}

In a broader sense, *Crisis* is an ongoing multi-media, multi-level experiment that explores alternative ideas for the distribution and exploitation of musical works. It is the journey of an album that defied the dominant structures of its system in order to break new ground.\n\nThis project aims to align *releases* ↔︎ *value* ↔︎ *community* into one common narrative. Read more about the process below.\n\n## The Story \\[Season 00\\]\n\nOne year ago the journey of Crisis began with the release of *[Crisis (The Worthless Album)](https://open.spotify.com/album/7nwbv2tj8q9OTWhin3ZBsm).* What had been planned as a traditional release, changed due to a pivotal decision.\n\nThe album was cut into 30 pieces, each 29 seconds long. Since a stream only starts counting after 30 seconds of playtime, it can't collect plays or earn any revenue, no matter how much it's listened to. The value of this album is 0.000$\n\nUltimately, this is the only way to choose one's own value in the current system of being patronised by a pro-rata system (streaming) of big tech and major labels. By releasing an album this way, it reveals quite the imbalance and absurdity of the music industry's current monetisation model and asks if centralised platforms should define the value of art according to a demand-supply calculation. Or, instead, shall creators regain complete control over the value they create.\n\n> \"*Valentin Hansen released an album in a way that’s never been done before.

Analysis of the OmniBTC ($SO) project, an all-chain trading platform", "body": "### Twitter@godotsancho\n\nWhat happens when you combine two leading cross-chain projects, built on LayerZeo and participating in the Polkadot slot auction? This is what OmniBTC will experiment with.\n\n## What is OmniBTC?\n\nOmniBTC, formerly SOSwap, is an omni-chain DeFi platform built by the ChainX team based on the LayerZero protocol, offering Token omni trading and omni lending of BTC.\n\n![SOSwap](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RpxaIE-MdP8H6Zn1r62Wy.png?height=510&width=865)\n\n**Core functions include.**\n1/ All-chain trading. Based on LayerZero chain-wide interoperability and MMC (Maker Margin Contract) contract, users can trade Tokens from any chain.\n\nWhen users trade, OmniBTC will calculate the best slippage and Gas scheme across DEX according to the algorithm, and divide the transaction amount into several parts to ensure that users complete the transaction in the best way.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BwV7s5Mow7xvUTMJpwnXv.png?height=444&width=865)\n\n2/BTC all-chain lending. Combining ChainX with LayerZero, users can lend out BTC to any stable coin on any chain.\nFor this feature, you need to cross-chain BTC to ChainX Bitcoin Taproot multi-signature address first to get XBTC.\nThen complete lending by ChainX and LayerZero.\n\nThe benefit of going through XBTC and then all-chain lending is that you don't have to wait for BTC's often 10-minute long block confirmation time when cross-chaining with BTC, shortening the waiting time.\nThis is especially crucial for margin calls in extreme market conditions.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ouNjMd6FfC50Wz6Mfxeh6.png?height=444&width=865)\n\nCurrently, OmniBTC is deployed to the Arbitrum and BSC networks and is participating in the current round of Polkadot slot auctions.\n\nUsers who vote DOT for OmniBTC will receive 0.3 SO Token per vote.\n\n0\\.33 SO Token per vote if voted via ComingChat.\n\nOmniBTC will establish a parallel chain of WASM + EVM, and LayerZero protocol will also be deployed in the parallel chain EVM, bringing omni transactions into Polkadot ecology, while users can use BTC to borrow stable coins USDT, aUSD, etc. within Polkadot ecology.\n\n**Summary**\nOmniBTC is an omni-chain trading platform, as well as a BTC omni-chain lending platform, built on LayerZero and Polkadot.\n\nUsing LayerZero omni-chain properties, it builds an entrance between Polkadot and omni-chain , helping aUSD and other Polkadot ecological native Tokens to increase liquidity and collateral categories.\n\n## Tokenomics\n\nOmniBTC native Token SO, total supply of 210,000.\n\nOutput 0.05 SOs per minute, 72 per day, halved every 2.1 million minutes.\n\nSO is allocated to users according to LP pool weight and LP ratio. PCX, USB, KSX, MINI trading pool weight is 5, SO with these four Token trading pool weight is 10, the rest is 1.\n\n## Current operation of the project\n\nCurrently, OmniBTC official website (<https://omnibtc.finance/>) shows that the application is not yet live (coming soon). SOSwap, current TVL $1.83 million, current TVL is the historical peak. 24-hour trading volume $1570, peak trading volume is $178,420.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y_PLVMRw3fl5kRJd3EcoD.png?height=328&width=865)\n\nSOSwap was launched in March 2022 and is currently live for trading, cross-chain bridges, liquidity mining, and supports SherpaX EVM , ChainX EVM and Polkadot mainnet.\n\nHowever, currently, certain features are not available when switching to ChainX and Polkadot chains. The main TVL and transactions are concentrated on the SherpaX chain.\n\nIn addition, OmniBTC will be integrated into ComingChat, another web3 social finance application in the ChainX ecosystem, which allows the 8 million ComingChat users worldwide to easily use OmniBTC on their cell phones.\n\n## Project Analysis\n\n### 1/ Is there a demand for it? How big is the market where it is located? What is the current market situation?\n\n![Data as of July 16, 2022, 13:30 UTC](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l2YlSDhXBvoKS9JTQbVGg.png?height=104&width=865)\n\nIn this paper, we choose ThorChain and Stargate Finance as the benchmark; ThorChain is an independent public chain and Stargate is an application built on LayerZero.\n\nOmniBTC is also built on LayerZero, and it participates in Polkadot slot auction and plans to become a parallel chain, so ThorChain with public chain and Stargate with application are selected for comparison.\n\n(1) Stargate mainly provides cross-chain function for EVM chain stablecoin and ETH.\n\nWhile ThorChain provides many non-EVM chain cross-chain functions, even PoW and PoS cross-chain, such as Dogecoin.\n\n(2) Both of these all-chain protocols have over 100 million TVLs. According to DeFiLlama, Stargate TVL is ranked 25th among all included dApps, and ThorChain is ranked 10th among included public chains, second only to Arbitrum and higher than Optimism.\n\n(3) ThorChain stipulates that when providing liquidity, users need to provide RUNE with other Tokens in a 1:1 ratio, which means that RUNE actually acts as a oracle and is priced by the RUNE Token in relation to other Token exchange. Therefore, ThorChain TVL is more closely related to RUNE.\n\n(4) From the current point of view, OmniBTC native Token economic model, more like STG, the relationship between market value and TVL, and the relationship between FDV and TVL, perhaps similar to Stargate. At that time, the TVL and ratio can be used to invert the SO market cap and FDV.\n\n(5) In the current bear market, the Stargate protocol still has a 24-hour trading volume of $2.8 million, while ThorSwap, the main DEX protocol of the ThorChain ecosystem, has a 24-hour trading volume of over $30 million.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ft3SalWafPja_AvRvxydX.png?height=604&width=865)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FJEMmCgAhjFzcRbMSEzja.png?height=491&width=865)\n\n(6) According to ThorChain and ThorSwap data, BTC, bUSD, ETH, BNB, USDC cross-chain is the main demand in terms of historical trading volume and current day trading volume.\n\nIn summary, OmniBTC is in the all-chain trading market, and the demand exists. Both ThorChain, an independent public chain, and Stargate, also built on LayerZero, have a TVL of over $400 million and a 24-hour transaction volume of over a million dollars in a bear market.\n\n### 2/ What are the core competencies of the project? Does it create a barrier? Competitive pairing situation?\n\nAt the full chain trading level.\nOmniBTC competitiveness is that (1) ChainX team has been steeped in BTC research for many years, and has certain advantages in securing assets and other technical aspects. (2) The support of Polka ecology.\n\nWithin the polka ecology.\nOmniBTC advantage is that there is no similar project at the moment. It has a first-mover advantage.\n\nIn fact, OmniBTC can be said to have certain advantages, but it is difficult to say whether it has built a barrier. The competitors are as shown in ThorChain and Stargate.\n\nIn the future, to observe whether OmniBTC has built a barrier, we can focus on the following indicators.\n(1) XBTC balance on ChainX chain. <https://scan.chainx.org/crossBlock>\n(2) The adoption of XBTC by other DeFi projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, and the XBTC pool liquidity.\n\n**Additional Bitcoin Taproot related knowledge.**\nChainX CEO Guo Guanghua has introduced the advantages of using Taproot in the AMA.\n\n**What is Taproot?**\n\nTaproot contains two important components: the MAST contract (MAST contract) and the Schnorr signature (Schnorr signature).\n\nThe MAST contract is a Merkle-tree-style data structure. Schnorr signature is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that allows linear addition to the signature.\n\n**What are the benefits of Taproot?**\n\nTaproot improves data privacy prior to, and during, bitcoin transactions. Also, multiple signatures can be added linearly within one, saving storage space and verification procedures, and improving performance. Breaking the original 15 multi-signature limit of Bitcoin, it is more decentralized.\n\nIn addition, the MAST contract incorporates scripting programming for greater programmability.\n\n**ChainX and Taproot**\n\nWe quote here from the official ChainX Blog (<https://chainx-org.medium.com/610-million-stolen-from-ronin-bridge-how-does-chainx-keep-user-assets-safe->) d84a545e5936).\n\nChainX’s custodians use the ComingChat threshold wallet with Taproot technology for multi-signature. Each trust keeps its own private key fragments, and these private key fragments are aggregated off-chain to form aggregated private keys and aggregated public keys.\n\nIn the traditional multi-signature scheme, people can know the address (public key) of each trust from the chain. \n\nBased on these addresses, hackers then use further methods to steal the private keys corresponding to these addresses. Taproot fundamentally solves this problem. \n\nThe Schnorr algorithm can realize the off-chain aggregation of private key fragments, so the outside world can only see a new address aggregated from the addresses of the 10 trustees on the chain, and people cannot even know whether it is an ordinary single signature or Multi-signature. \n\nf it is impossible to know the respective addresses of each trust, it is naturally impossible to know the respective private keys of each trust. This ensures the absolute security of user assets.\n\n### 3/ What are the current shortcomings of the project?\n\n(1) OmniBTC is currently under-publicized and under-attended. There are 2,112 Twitter followers.\n(2) The balance of XBTC on ChainX chain is 19.6536 pieces in total. At the funding level, it does not help OmniBTC much.\n\n(3) Currently there are not many trading pairs available in OmniBTC DEX, the Token variety is not rich enough, and it is concentrated on the EVM chain SherpaX. A large number of Swap Pools are underfunded and cannot be traded.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NS64laqYhNLpjZG7SHD3n.png?height=464&width=865)\n\n### 4/ Future direction of the project? How expandable is the business? Can business expansion expand market capitalization?\n\n(1) The launch of the non-custodial model, in improving BTC cross-chain security, with liquidity mining incentives, and the adoption of XBTC by other projects in Polkadot ecology. It may be able to gain more market share.\n\n(2) OmniBTC is still in the early stage, there is still a lot of work to do in terms of liquidity building, and the BTC omni-chain lending pool is not yet online.\n\n(3) OmniBTC BTC omni-chain lending is planned to cooperate with MakerDAO. If the BTC all-chain lending is then combined with PCX rewards, it may attract more users and share part of the market share of wBTC and renBTC.\n\n### 5/ Team situation?\n\nOmniBTC is developed by the PolkaX team. The team is currently developing the Bitcoin Layer2 network ChainX, the crypto chat tool ComingChat, the EVM network SherpaX, and more.\n\nIn the official Blog published on August 3, 2021 (<https://chainx-org.medium.com/chainx-an-overview-a418005e54bf>), the current 5 development teams are introduced.\n\nWorking on XBTC 2.0, Taproot integration, EVM and WASM, ComingChat UI and UX, and ComingChat Red Envelope for Coming Chat, respectively.\n\n### 6/ Social media situation?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cuabM-rOZkw70XBWHsQjf.png?height=454&width=865)\n\n### 7/ Under what circumstances can barriers be broken? How can you tell when a barrier is broken? What are the indicators?\n\nOmniBTC is still in its early stage and has not built a competitive barrier. As mentioned earlier, one can focus on.\n(1) XBTC balance on ChainX chain. <https://scan.chainx.org/crossBlock>\n(2) XBTC adoption by other DeFi projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, and XBTC pool liquidity.\n\n### 8/ What are the people and drivers of token selling and buying, respectively? Can the demand for token purchases be sustained? Can it offset token sell-offs? Can business expansion increase demand for tokens?\n\nAs of now, the SO sell-off is mainly coming from liquidity mining rewards.\n\nToken application scenarios other than liquidity mining have not been fully announced. Perhaps a Gas scenario will be available in the future.\n\nIn the long term, SO value will come primarily from demand for governance of the BTC omni-chain lending pool, and treasury revenue for purchase to destroy SO, or possibly through a deflationary scenario similar to the EIP1559 proposal, but the time required is all expected to be long.\n\n### 9/ Risks?\n\n(1) Systemic risks from the security side.\n(2) Substitution risk from Polkadot ecology in addition to the full chain of projects.\n\n## Twitter @godotsancho", "timestamp": 1658154783, "digest": "3Y7ocHE5gaTd55Al9qOyCGpjuhFw-ZNu8no_BkIx42w", "contributor": "0xCBd79B90a9B6A09B22D463494a474062f47Cc4Cf"}

{"id": "hr-Ia2wgFK8s9irAaPBIA3ryS2NXcnLcYwekIlprOpE", "title": "Web3 academy", "body": "“The age of Web3 is coming!”, “The Web3 arms race is upon us”. These are just few of the headlines that came along in 2022 so far. Is this just a new hype that has been unleashed or could Web3 really become a technology revolution? Via a series of articles, Tech Lab will explain more about Web3, what is it, how does it work, what can it do, and what are the main challenges ahead.\n\nSo, what is Web3? Let’s firsthave a look at Web2. Because if there is a Web3, there must be a Web2, right? Web2 is the internet as we know it today. One of the main characteristics of Web2 is that information, web applications, platforms and services are centralised. If we want to participate in the Web2 world, we are forced to share our data and identity with organisations like Meta and Google, with very little control over what happens with that data and identity. \n\nOne of the main tasks of Web3 is to shift the power over data and identity towards the owner or initiator of the data. By organising the internet in a decentralised way,data can be stored anywhere,also thanks to blockchain administering data control, ownership, as well asuring data privacy through encryption. This is why Web3 is also called decentralized internet or decentralized web. \n\nWhen you hear people talking about Web 3.0 (instead of Web3) they could also mean something else, namely the semantic web. Both Web3 and Web 3.0 want to offer an alternative to the current web,but they have a different focus. The semantic web (Web 3.0)focuses on efficiency and intelligence,and works by reusing and linking data across websites. The decentralized web (Web3)focuseson empowerment and security,by giving power over data and identity back to the people.\n\nSo, when you read something online about the subject, how can you really distinguish the two concepts? Well, apparently you cannot be 100% sure. The fact that there is still no consensus about the definition of Web3 is part of the challenge. It’s hard to write a series of articles on something that hasn’t been defined yet, but here at Tech Lab we like challenges. And from now on, whenever you see us talking about Web3, keep in mind that we are referring to the decentralized web.\n\nTo be continued...", "timestamp": 1658155205, "digest": "jGmm7yLfQf-QLl3k361OF4ZNDLVuw1xcrHma2uEsGx8", "contributor": "0x13366EAF0cC9f36eaAD8247036dE7D78c6f4B37B"}

of History **本身并不是共识机制**，而是用于提高 Solana 的 Proof of Stake (权益证明) 共识的性能。\n\n它还可以用于提高数据平面协议的性能，历史证明 (POH) 建立了一个历史记录，证明在特定时间点存在特定事件。每个验证者都会跟踪时间, 通过在 SHA-256、顺序散列可验证延迟函数 (VDF) 中对其进行编码。因此，验证者之间无需在处理前进行相互通信确认 ( 通常每个节点需要沟通自己的 precommit 和 prevote), 这大大提高了在速度以及容量上的效率。\n\n举个例子：汽车制造厂，以往在零部件生产出来后，汽车需要依次通过冲压，焊接，涂装，总装加工等流程，而汽车制造厂也是依据这个步骤生产不同的零件，而 POH 允许汽车制造厂同时完成不同零件的生产，之后这些零件再按照拼装顺序，完成冲压，焊接，涂装，总装加工等，POH 允许并行生产的可能性，大大减少了沟通成本和时间成本。\n\n在我们上篇文章 [Solana 的逆袭之路 - SQLANA](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNzUyOTYzMw==&mid=2247483860&idx=1&sn=95b6e869d391c73f04daed4c82cd83be&chksm=e8c67e9adfb1f78ca9007c3e47e5dc51bbed36424f05c6da867f2741f025d6d10642b927e640&token=976057225&lang=zh_CN&scene=21#wechat_redirect), 我们重点介绍了 **Solana 的特性**，包括 Proof of History 共识机制、TPS 和 TTF 完美结合、优先交易模型、 **Solana 的去中心化之路**、**Solana 上流动性质押协议**、**NFT 市场**等，而本文我们将进一步挖掘其**技术细节**、**设计框架**以及最新上线的 Solana Mobile Stack 等**产品**，**生态简介**以及其潜在的新上线的 **L1 竞品**。\n\nSolana 目前主要背靠 FTX 以及 Jump Crypto，与中心化交易所的紧密联系, 会加速新用户以及资金的流入，如果做类比的话可以考虑币安及 BNB 链，除了提供低交易费用，BNB 链的搭建也意在战略层面为巨大的币安用户群提供 Defi 的第一个入口。\n\n此外, 币安的 Launchpad 和币安 Defi 质押等产品是用户与 BNB 生态交互的关键,  进一步加速了网络的蓬勃发展。当然币安除了 BNB 链以外, 还有币安智能链 (BSC), 币安智能链（BSC）可以理解为与币安链并行的区块链，与币安链不同的地方在于，BSC (POA) 拥有智能合约功能并与以太坊虚拟机（EVM）兼容。\n\n这里的设计目标是保持完整币安链的高吞吐量的同时，能够将智能合约引入其生态系统。(之前有社区小伙伴不了解 mapofzone 中 Crypto.Org 以及 Cronos 的区别, 我们也与 Cronos 上 POA 进行了沟通。本质上你可以将 Crypto.Org 理解为 BNBchain, 通过质押等产品拓展生态, 而 Cronos 可以理解为 BSC, 其引入了 EVM 兼容, 并且通过 POA 共识机制提供开放, 可扩展性以及可互操作性的开放式平台。)\n\n因此，Solana 采用了类似的策略, 包括集成 FTX 以及利用 FTX 团队开发的 Serum’s CLOB 模型；而 Jump Crypto 在 Solana 的早期提供了非常大的作用，作为行业头部的资本巨鳄以及做市商，其深度的参与做市帮助 Solana 减少了交易流动性风险，而低流动性、 高滑点对于早期项目的发展是非常不利的。当然随着网络的发展, 用户的增长以及生态的搭建，做市商的作用将会逐渐被弱化。\n\nElectic Capital 是一家专注于技术开发社区的 Web3.0 资本，根据 2021 的报告结果，Solana 的开发者在这一年增长了 500%，在开发者增长率上排名第一。同时 Rust 语言, Solana, Polkadot, Cosmos 都在使用的, 在 2021Stack Overflow 开发者问卷调查中也排名第一, 这个结果也帮助解释了 Rust 开发者社区的快速增长。\n\n尽管目前以以太坊主导的 EVM 开发社区仍然是加密行业中主导力量，我们认为新的开发语言 (比如 Rust) 会为行业输入更多新的开发者（包括 Web2.0），并且带来更多的创新。当然，具有 Solana 可扩展性以及流动性的 Neon 以太坊兼容环境的出现（可以理解为 Cosmos 上的 Evmos 或者 Polkadot 上的 MoonBeam 等）, 以及 Solana Mobile 等新产品的上线，会进一步为 Solana 带来更多的项目和用户。\n\n## 核心技术\n\n### POH\n\n快速、可靠的同步是 Solana 能够实现如此高吞吐量的最大原因，一般区块链 L1 在区块上进行同步, 区块可以理解为一篮子交易，区块时间指的是开采一个新区块所需的时间。在以太坊中，平均出块时间在 12 到 14 秒之间，并在每个区块挖出后再进行评估，预期区块时间在协议层面被设定为一个常数，当矿工增加计算能力时，用于保护网络的安全，平均区块时间与预期区块时间进行比较，如果平均区块时间较高，则区块头的难度会降低。\n\n所以通过同步区块，交易只有到一定区块时间才会被处理。在 POW 共识机制中, 这个区块时间通常比较长, 需要 10 分钟, 以减少多个验证节点在同一时间生产有效区块的可能性。这个问题我们在[加密经济的 MEV 博弈：Osmosis 的阈值加密技术 vs Flashbot 的 SGX?](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNzUyOTYzMw==&mid=2247483913&idx=1&sn=36a552cedfde980728b6dd79a4873299&chksm=e8c67d47dfb1f451b6f51d5a113496edcdc4906977d71a4b3d74ad3cc376137ccd8773c0c7c7&token=2086007547&lang=zh_CN&scene=21#wechat_redirect) 中提到过,  在 POW 中 (概率出块)， 两个矿工可以同时算出这个概率结果，但是由于网络延迟等原因，你无法保证其他人是否也在同一时间算出了这个结果。\n\n而对于节点来说，你需要决定将哪个区块加入到公共账本，这个会根据两个区块的计算工作总量来决定。这里面的问题在于如果能够即时回滚几个区块，快速执行比实际规范更多的计算工作，然后将其显示给网络，这个就是我们通常指的时间强盗攻击 Time bandit attack，所以在 POW 中区块是同时提交的，而确认会需要更多时间，因为攻击者在解密后可以通过潜在的重组给链带来 MEV 漏洞。\n\n而在 POS 中没有这种限制，但是验证者需要通过时间戳决定区块顺序。通常的做法是给每个区块标注时间戳，但是受到网络延迟等影响，时间戳的有效性通常在 1-2 小时，为了解决这个问题, 区块时间也被相应延长, 确保每个区块的中位时间戳总是在增加**。**\n\n而在 Solana 的 POH 机制设计中，领导节点通过加密证明 (自从上次证明已经过去了一段时间) “时间戳” 区块。所有散列到证明中的数据肯定是在证明生成之前发生的，然后这个领导节点和验证节点共享新区块，验证节点负责验证这些证明。所以本质上 POH 可以理解为一堆证明，每一个都证明一些数据存在在创建证明之前，同时在上一个证明之前已经过去了一段时间。\n\n这些区块可以以任意顺序发送给验证节点，通过这种可信同步的概念,Solana 可以将区块分解为更小的条目 (相比于区块包括更小的批次交易)，而在区块共识确认之前, 这些条目 (entries) 将以实时流 (Stream) 的形式传输给验证节点，所以通过这种技术，Solana 可以实现毫秒级别的确认时间 (800 毫秒=0.8 秒)。\n\n这里要注意的是,，领导节点将有效批次交易放置于条目之后, 这些条目可以迅速以实时流 (Steam) 的形式传输给验证节点，而在的假设下,，这个过程并不会出现延迟，也就是接受条目之后，验证节点可以立即投票， 而这个**乐观处理技术**我们称为乐观并发控制 Optimitstic Concurrency Control。\n\n所以相较于大部分主打 POS 机制的 Layer1 链，通过将交易广播至全网后才能完成确认 (节点间也需要再沟通自己的 precommit 和 prevote, 之后节点集投票代表某个区块高度的全账本, 交易确认)，在 Solana 上，交易确认只需要验证上个条目的 POH 哈希。\n\n### VDF\n\nPOH 最先于 2017 年 11 月由 Solana 提出, 而次年斯坦福大学介绍了一种类似的技术，称为可验证延迟函数或者称为 VDF， 是个需要固定时间来执行的函数，并且可以生成它运行的证明，而这个证明相较于生成所需的时间，可以在更短的时间内进行验证，所以其核心特性是快速的验证时间。Solana 验证其延迟函数的方法与创建其所花费的时间成正比，拆分 4000 core GPU , 速度足以满足 Solana 的要求，但是 Solana 的算法相对较慢。所以 VDF 泛指可验证延迟函数的类别，而不仅仅是具有特定性能特征的子集。\n\nPoH 和 VDF 之间的另一个区别是 VDF 仅用于跟踪持续时间，而 PoH 的哈希链包括应用程序观察到的任何数据的哈希值，所以在 POH 中，尽管数据证明了历史，证明了某事件在某个特定时间点发生——数据肯定存在于它之后的哈希之前。但另一方面，这意味着应用程序可以通过更改数据被哈希的时间来操纵哈希链 (POH)。因此，PoH 链不能作为随机性的良好来源，而没有该数据的 VDF 则可以。例如，Solana 的领导者旋转算法仅来自 VDF 高度，而不是来源于其在该高度的哈希值。\n\n#### 设计框架\n\n相比于以太坊的 12-13 秒区块时间, 和每个区块 7,000 笔交易的区块大小，Solana 可以实现 0.4 秒区块时间, 和每个区块 2,000 笔交易的区块大小，同时用户可以享有极低的交易手续费。\n\n同时，Solana 引入的 POH 机制、VDF 函数等执行层的创新, 使其实现了底层的扩展， 相比于模块化的设计, 此设计的优势在于可编程性以及可组合性，而 Rollup 为代表的模块化区块链会存在分散性流动性以及 Rollups 之间的可信桥互通问题，当然虽然目前 Rollups 之间的无需信任互操作性仍然没有完全解决，但是 Slush 等相关提案已经在关于如何在不同 ZKR 间实现无缝分型拓展进行讨论。\n\n同时 Polynya 也公开表示，Solana 的执行层创新是 Rollups 应该学习的，尽管 Rollups 它们在很多方面都具有不可持续的架构，但可以通过采用欺诈证明、有效性证明和/或数据可用性抽样来解决很多问题, 而下文也会介绍 Solana 也将计划引入这些技术。\n\n除了执行层的创新，Solana 非常依赖于摩尔定律，所以 Solana 节点需要的硬件配置要求相较于其他 L1 也会高很多，一个 Solana 的验证节点可以加载几百个以太坊 2.0 节点, 而其扩展性也随着时间依赖于硬件的性能和迭代对这块感兴趣的可以看我们之前的文章单片链 vs 模块链- [Solana 和 Celestia 创始人最新辩论](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNzUyOTYzMw==&mid=2247483845&idx=1&sn=ad0ffe00e8b9e2987d9fc01cd4471822&chksm=e8c67e8bdfb1f79d807f71602d7c6a5fea2c39dad945cefdead0c893820f99426d2d9ba98e55&token=2086007547&lang=zh_CN&scene=21#wechat_redirect)。\n\n所以尽管硬件的性能有助于其扩展性, 也会带来与之而来的 trade off 问题。目前考虑到较高的门槛, 大部分的节点都以 Solana 基金会的名义运营, 同时在 1876 个节点中, 前 25 个节点就掌握了 33.% 的质押, 而 33.33% 的质押勾结就可以摧毁整个网络。所以无论是高度依赖基金会的节点分布, 还是头重脚轻的节点权重, 都给整个网络带来了潜在的中心化风险。\n\n而本文的开头也提出,Solana 目前用的是 Rust 语言, 而目前以太坊主导的 EVM 开发社区仍然是加密行业的核心力量, 对于开发者来说,EVM 可以快速, 轻松地在其他兼容链上部署, 而 EVM 使用的是 Solidity 语言。\n\n然而, 我们看到 Rust (Wasm 语言区中最大的, 第二大的是 Assembly Script, 第三大 Go 等) 社区正在经历快速的增长, 不管在不同生态 (Cosmos, Solana, Polkadot) 人气增长, 还是从 Web2.0 开发者社区迁移来的大量新开发者, 同时 Rust 的高门槛, 大量减少了分叉项目。\n\n这里要提几个核心点,Solana 上的项目是部分开源 (Serum, Magic Eden 没有开源?), 而在 Cosmos 上通常情况下, 尽管可以直接分叉项目 (比如分叉 Osmosis, 但是实际上并不可行, 你需要去寻找一系列安全的验证节点), 但是消费链的上线似乎又降低了这个门槛, Proposal 72 提及的 P2P Validator 开发的 Neutron 似乎是分叉了 Juno Network, 因而引发了 Juno 生态的极度方案。当然分叉某个模块没为什么问题, 比如 Sceret 等链分叉 Gravity Bridge, Goland 分叉了 Cosmos SDK 等。\n\n## 中心化以及扩展性解决方案\n\nSolana 现有的中心化性质对网络的安全构成了风险。然而随着时间的推移，节点数量增多, 网络可能会变得更加分散。当然我们之前也多次强调去中心化和节点数量并没有直接联系。什么是真正的去中心化呢，比如质押/哈希算法的分发范围，比如代币的分发范围，比如客户端的个数，比如参与共识的验证节点数，比如可以影响 POS33% 或者 POW51% 的节点和矿工数。\n\n举个例子，虽然 Cosmos 目前协议从 150 个节点增加到了 175 个节点，但也并不说明了更去中心化。他们希望实现的是真正实现投票权/治理的分散。所以 Cosmos 希望通过治理解决，将 Community Pool 的资金分发给不同的长尾节点（质押数量不多，新的节点），但是有非常好的，产品服务发展路径，通过提供质押资金，让他们更好地为 Cosmos 生态赋能 (funding public goods - Optiminism Two Token house model)。\n\n那么 Solana 上是怎么解决的呢? 这里不得不提到 Solana 上的**流动性质押协议**，其中目前排名第一的 Marinade 一定程度上帮助实现了治理/质押权益的分散。Marinade Finance 将质押分散给不同的小社区节点, 确保收益和激励分发给到社区, 最终反哺给生态, 同时也缓解了中心化的问题。\n\n而 **Solana 高度依赖的摩尔定律**认为集成电路上可以容纳的晶体管数目在大约每经过 18 个月便会增加一倍，所以相同的价格下购买的机器，每 18 个月可以提升一倍的性能，所以 Solana 节点需要的硬件配置要求非常之高，而其扩展性也随着时间依赖于硬件的性能和迭代, 硬件的提升也会一定程度上解决这个验证节点的高门槛问题。\n\n同时, 基于其在执行层的现有创新,Anatoly 会考虑引入欺诈证明, 有效性证明以及数据可见采样等技术, 在不牺牲性能的前提下, 提升网络的安全性。值得注意的是，区块链网络首先是社会经济运动，其次是代码。因此，虽然采用更好的代码是最受欢迎的，并且可能会带来技术上的可持续性，但实现社会和经济上的可持续性同样重要。\n\n目前为止，Solana 上的费用微不足道，没有任何拥堵费，它可以支付运行复制品 (replicas) 的成本，至少在牛市的时候是这样。硬件并不昂贵，任何具有任何 PMF 的链都可以支付费用 (Polynya 和 Anatoly 的 Twiter 讨论)。当然其社会可持续性体现在较低门槛的 DPOS 机制, 实现真正的全民民主制度。\n\n产品方面, Solana 带来了极好的用户体验, Phantom 以及 Magic Eden 都已经上线了手机版本, 同时 Solana Mobile Stack 和 Saga 将会推动 Solana 移动兼容性, 助力 Solana 的 mass adoption 进度。目前, 大部分加密行业的产品还主要集中于电脑端, 而 Solana 手机的上线致力于改变这种现状。\n\n通过 Solana Mobile Stack，一个适用于 Android 的开源软件工具包，使用 Seed Vault 安全托管协议在 Solana 上可以启用原生 Android web3 应用程序，该协议有助于即时签署交易，同时将私钥与钱包、应用程序和 Android 操作系统分开。\n\n其中的核心功能包括**移动钱包适配器**：一种用于将 Web 应用程序和原生 Android 应用程序连接到移动设备上的钱包的协议。开源协议旨在支持所有移动平台，而不仅仅是 Android，并且可以与钱包应用程序一起使用，为远程运行的应用程序（如其他移动设备、台式机或笔记本电脑）提供签名服务。\n\n**Seed Vault**：内置于移动设备中的安全环境，将私钥、助记词和机密与应用程序层分开，但仍能够与设备或移动浏览器中运行的应用程序进行交互。Seed Vault 可访问设备上可用的最高特权安全环境，从处理器的安全操作模式到专用安全元素，通过 Android 内置的 UI 组件实现安全的交易签名体验。\n\n**适用于 Android 的 Solana Pay**：Solana Pay 是 Solana 上的分散式支付轨道，内置于 Solana Mobile Stack，使钱包应用能够使用 Android 设备的系统功能通过 QR 码、NFC 点击、消息和用于启动 Solana Pay 请求的 Web 浏览器交互。此外，即时虚拟卡发行将允许用户通过传统支付渠道在全球数千万商户进行基于自托管资金的非接触式移动支付。\n\n**此外，Solana dApp Store** 是 Android 上用于去中心化应用程序的新应用程序分发系统。Solana dApp Store 将为希望与客户建立直接关系的应用程序提供分销渠道，让他们无需支付平台费用即可进行交易。Solana dApp Store 将与设备上的 Google Play 共存，提供对 web2 和 web3 应用程序的访问。\n\n所以 Solana Mobile 在将新用户引入 Solana 方面的重要性是非常巨大的。同时还宣布承诺提供 1000 万美元的生态系统捐赠，以加速移动 dApp 的开发, 有兴趣的童鞋可以联系我们。\n\n除了 Rust 社区, Solana 也在向 EVM 社区扩展, Neon Labs 的开发——Solana 上的原生 EVM。这让 Solana 可以更具有可扩展性并提高其在其他 L1 中的竞争力。它目前在\n\nSolana Devnet 上面向开发人员和测试人员的 Alpha 阶段。该项目提出由 Jump Capital 和 Spartan 等知名投资者领投的 4000 万美元。Neon 的 EVM 实现将允许它处理\n\n到 4,500 TPS，如果成功, 这将使 Solana 成为全球最快的 EVM 兼容区块链。虽然没有明确的主网启动日期，我们 CFG Labs 将保持持续关注。当然, 鉴于与 EVM 架构相关的工具和基础设施以及其强大的网络效应, 除了 Solana 以外, 其他链, 比如 Polkadot(Moonbeam), Polygon, Avalanche 也接入了 EVM。\n\n聊到跨链这块,Solana 上跨以太坊的两个值得注意的桥包括和 Allbridge。最近，FTX 宣布支持\n\nWormhole 的 Portal 桥成为他们首选的跨链桥。这意味着 FTX 将扩大对 Portal-wrapped 代币 存款和取款的支持。这意味着，Portal 桥将支持为 FTX 上 500 百万用户提供了更加无缝的桥接体验。通过启用 Portal 包装的 ERC-20 代币（如 $ETH $YFI 和 $SUSHI）的存款/取款，FTX 社区的用户可以轻松地在 Solana 上的各种 DeFi 协议中使用他们的代币。\n\n所有 Portal 包装 (Portal Wrapped) 的资产都可以在链之间自由移动，而不会被双重包装。这意味着，用户可以将 ETH(Portal) 从 Ethereum 发送到 Polygon，再到 Solana 到 Oasis - 他们仍然拥有 ETH(Portal)。\n\n关于生态系统的增长，Solana 通过举办一系列黑客马拉松吸引开发者 。2020 年 11 月的第一届黑客马拉松，吸引了超过 1,000 名参与者和 60 多名项目。从那以后，又举办了四次黑客马拉松，每一次的人数都在增加项目提交和申请人的数量。IGNITION，第四届黑客马拉松，共计收到近 6000 名申请者和 568 个项目提交。 \n\n## 潜在风险\n\n如果经常发生中断，Solana 上的网络不稳定将会是一个重大问题。2022 年迄今已发生 5 次停机，停机时间从 最近一次的 4 小时到 1 月份的一次长达 6 天，网络中断主要归因于 NFT 铸造机器人和套利机器人。因此为了提高网络稳定性并减少链上造成的停机时间，Solana 在其测试网上的 v1.10 更新中实施了更改网络。Metaplex（帮助开发和启动 NFT 的协议）也\n\n将进行更改以稳定网络，例如实施机器人 Metaplex Candy Machine 中的罚款以及试图执行无效交易的任何钱包的 0.01 SOL 罚款。这些手段可以在机器人交易发生时检测它们，大大减少未来的网络拥塞情况。大多数新的 #SolanaNFT 项目都使用 Candy Machine 来推出他们的系列和作品。\n\n在这个更改中，当钱包尝试完成无效交易时，将收取 0.01 SOL 罚款，这通常由盲目尝试铸造的机器人操作。为了防止 human 支付罚款，前端铸造应用程序需要验证目标 Candy Machine 是否有资格进行铸造。收集到的 Botting 惩罚将提供给 Candy Machine 实例的配置帐户。随后 Candy Machine 的创建者将自行决定如何使用从这些罚款中收取的资金。\n\n同时 Solana 生态系统的互连性是需要考虑的网络失败的重要因素。根据 SolanaFM 的报告，超过 39% Solana 的程序执行通过 Serum。对于 Mango Markets 和 Raydium，\n\n他们 13% 和 99% 的程序执行也被路由到 Serum。2022 年第一季度, Solana 中 50% 涉及 Serum 程序。这给 Solana 生态系统带来了巨大的例如 Serum 的单点故障风险, 如果涉及到流动性和交易问题, 那么多 Solana 上的核心 Defi 协议将会受到影响。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EQe7TmMv_qvX7U-McGX4E.png?height=533&width=1080)\n\n我们将在 Solana 的技术理解、设计框架、最新产品以及生态简介 (二) 中继续介绍其即将上线的几个 Meta 大公链竞品 (Aptos, Sui 等) ，生态情况以及更多观点分享。\n\n## Reference\n\n[Nansen Alpha Research](https://www.nansen.ai/nansen-alpha)\n\n[Solana docs](https://docs.solana.com/)\n\n[Solana mobile

In other words, it is based on the idea that decentralization is about the people and not private companies.**\n\n **Breaking Domain monopoly**\n\n**According to the 2021 Global Domain Report(InterNetX and Sedo), domain registrations are on the increase around the world with .com TLD leading the industry.** \n\n**However, there is a dark side of the domain industry that comes in the form of a monopoly by private companies like Ethos Capital which was recently indicted for ‘insider dealing’. The reality of this heavily corrupt and monopolised industry is made more evident by the fact the .com TLD has become the cash cow of a government backed monopoly whose profit is over %60.** \n\n**Why .dao TLD matters.**\n\n**Have you ever wondered what constitutes a domain name and why it is the the last thing you type in your browser’s URL bar!?**\n\n **The last string of letters preceding the last dot are the components of a registered domain name and they yet represent a powerful force in today’s digital world where building a strong online presence equates to finding the perfect domain name.**\n\n **In the analogical sense, a domain name(.com) is the address of a website(www.amazon) when it is compared to a house. It can also be described as the land where your website is located on the internet.**\n\n **It matters not just to businesses operating in the digital realm but also to web 3 builders to care about their domains and where they are hosted in order to gain visibility and a fair advantage in the domain industry.**\n\n **This is why creating an internet-native organisation to govern something as a significant as a domain name in the web 3 space might just be a way to rally the world to a noble cause through blockchain technology.**\n\n **Conclusion**\n\n **DomainDAO is set to become as a people-owned TLD space for DAOs in the web 3 ecosystem through the public registration of the .dao TLD which is a move to revolutinize the domain industry.**", "timestamp": 1658156446, "digest": "97oi0P495Ai7d8PmmJIAxDP_ADYUFE5ZRwYbrAnz-yg", "contributor": "0xDEb0e6f32e80694e998e6fAEd0Ace223f5945f89"}

They’re the ones in charge of providing Bilbao with clean water, as well as purifying the wastewater created.\n\nAs a product designer for DigitaLinkers, my task was to re-design their SCADA system (A SCADA is a central controller for industrial machinery).\n\nThis project is a continuation of CASE STUDY 1. In order to gain a better context, I’d recommend you to take a look at that one before reading this case study.\n\n![Initial screenshots of their SCADA system](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yijz8x1vmyWnI1ByZCXzA.png?height=1270&width=2461&size=medium)\n\nThe first part of the project was to design a dashboard that gave an overview of the plant’s processes. The second one was to improve the experience for the plant’s controllers, which is what this case is about.\n\n\\**This particular software is only available for Desktop, and they have a fixed resolution for their screens, which made responsive irrelevant for this project.*\n\n## Discovery\n\nWhen this project started, we had already covered some ground as part of the discovery phase. Nevertheless, we were still missing to talk to the heavy users of the software: the operations team.\n\nWe had a different sessions where we went through the flows and actions of each of the different operation profiles. When we were done, we came up with rules and constrains we’d need to follow and also identified some data that wasn’t necessary and we could get rid of.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. **Make the UI cleaner and easier to read.** Almost everybody agreed that the UI was very heavy to the eyes.\n2. **Improve the way alerts were displayed.** With some many graphical elements alerts were constantly missed or ignored.\n3. **Improve the flows and navigation.** They had inconsistent navigation patterns which result in users getting lost in the interface.\n\n## Hands on\n\n### Navigation\n\nThe first thing we did was to map the software structure, so we could define a proper navigation pattern. In the end, we went for a tree structure with a Breadcrumb, that would always let the user know where they were.\n\n### Colors\n\nAs we had already defined a color palette for the Dashboard project, we just inherited it and keep working with it.\n\n### Flows\n\nIn order to understand better the flows they had, we went for a full deconstruction of the screens and try and understand what they wanted to show.\n\n![Wireframe of one of the screens (One of the first iterations)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bomViWzwUF2erCSfmjsfr.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\nWe set a weekly iterative process, where I showed my progress on Friday, we went over it, discussed it and got some initial feedback, and then they sent all the final feedback on Tuesday. Then I’d present my progress on Friday, and so on.\n\n### Iconography\n\nAfter the flows were accepted, then we went to the icon design phase, where each of the elements should be clear, but at the same time abstract enough so that they could be easily placed in the system, reducing all the clutter the images they were using before created.\n\nThe biggest challenge here was to follow the guides and constrains from the software, so we had to come up with a system for displaying all kind of different status.\n\n![General structure for different cases for each of the elements](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gzZe_TikEnOlINgkskfGP.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\n## Design System\n\nOnce the iconography was put in place, we developed a system for the developers to follow it, so they could then build all of the software following it.\n\n![Before & after of one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgLEkCNDeK8TnY-81sFsI.png?height=1363&width=4863&size=medium)\n\nWe also created a UI Kit that was shared with them as a PDF. [You can check it here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12s6WQlfojBbAdWSwTUBJcampO6kTsd9j/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Final product\n\nIn the end, we created a design system for them to build their SCADA according to their needs (Alarms, different states, processes, CTAs, etc).\n\n![Final design for one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Y-KAPCB7YCJnohGr__tG.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\nThe project ended pretty well, on time, and the client is still happy with the result, which makes it a success :)", "timestamp": 1658156038, "digest": "F97mr8VqCgg1md2iV9Nq1a3InNTA6BzyFVLa9XlQmUU", "contributor": "0xaB0684A4AA2Bb286C7a6b7E7E9b5f660cb062A3d"}

O’Clock Capital将通过分析过往三轮牛市形成的具体原因，对下一轮牛市做出预测。\n\n## 一、三轮加密市场牛市上涨，在其中起着重要作用的都有谁？\n\n### 第一轮牛市: 2012年Q4～2013年Q4——匿名支付需求量的增加\n\n**2009年1月3日**，中本聪在芬兰使用小型服务器挖出了比特币创世区块，比特币由此诞生。\n\n**2010年5月22日**，佛罗里达程序员拉斯勒·豪涅茨，花10000比特币在“棒约翰”叫了两块匹萨外卖，从此比特币开始逐渐开启现实世界的使用。\n\n**2011年**，比特币开始在匿名支付领域被使用，但是直到2012年维基解密为了打破封锁，开始接收比特币的捐助，才使得比特币的使用范围大幅增加。\n\n随着比特币减半和丝绸之路2.0的开启，使得比特币供给相对减少，而需求进一步增加，比特币价格不断攀升，最终在2013年11月到达第一轮牛市最高点1163美金。\n\n**第一轮牛市最大的意义是比特币进入匿名支付领域，有了现实应用，并且带动了价格的蹿升。这使得挖矿变得越来越流行，参与者也随之增多，由矿机和电力成本构建的经济模型开始运转，成为比特币底层的价值支撑，从而使得比特币减半对于价格影响增加。**\n\n### 第二轮牛市: 2016年Q3～2017年Q4——矿业的高速发展以及爱西欧吸引资金入场\n\n2015年矿业高速发展，国内的鱼池与蚂蚁矿池形成了两强相争的局面，这两家矿池算力之和最高时达到了整个矿业算力的50%。这一时期大量资金购买矿机进入矿池挖矿，由于需求的增加，矿机得以以10倍于制造成本的价格来销售，并且是以期货的形式出售，这些相当于加了杠杆的资金大量进入加密市场，推高了比特币价格，反过来比特币价格上涨，又促进了矿机的销售，形成了上涨的螺旋。同期USDT出现，并且迅速被各大交易平台使用，尤其是在亚洲，他的桥梁作用和价值稳定性方便更多用户进入加密市场。这些原因导致的需求增加，以及比特币减半的到来，对于开启新的比特币牛市起到了关键作用。\n\n2014年7月的以太坊是迄今为止最大的“爱西欧”之一，筹措资金超过1800万美元。2015年以太坊为代表的智能合约区块链平台逐渐成熟，尤其是ERC-20协议只需短短几分钟就能创建出一个新的Token，此举大大降低了区块链创业和爱西欧发行的成本，爱西欧几乎成为区块链创业企业融资的标配。基于区块链技术的创业项目井喷，让没有赶上比特币红利的投资者开始把目光转向爱西欧，之后各种传统投资机构的不断入场，进一步将第二轮牛市从比特币牛市推向全面牛市。 \n \n\n2017年芝加哥期权交易平台（COBE）和芝加哥商品交易平台（CME）开放了比特币期货的交易，比特币第一次获得了主流金融市场的认可。最终在2017年12月比特币到达第二轮牛市的最高点19666美金。\n\n**第二轮牛市中矿业高速发展，比特币基于挖矿经济模型产生的底层价值更加稳固，这使得比特币减半对于市场的影响进一步增加，另外杠杆资金的进入，以及后来的爱西欧引入大量场外资金共同促成了第二轮牛市。** \n \n\n**同时我们看到了牛市周期的一种模式：牛市初期比特币拉升，中期以太坊的发展又推动了全面牛市，牛市末期比特币进入传统金融将市场推向最高点。这种模式第一次在牛市周期中出现，这种模式对于未来走势预判有很大参考意义。** \n \n\n### 第三轮牛市：2020年Q2～2021年Q4——疫情环境下的美联储放水以及DeFi、NFT市场爆发\n\n2020年在新冠疫情影响下，美联储释放出“零利率+无限QE”的“金融核武器”，而且拜登一上台就提出了天量的 1.9 万亿美元新冠援助计划。对于金融市场而言，拜登的 1.9 万亿新冠援助计划，就像一个的巨大泡沫。在这样巨大的泡沫下，大量资金从传统金融资产外溢到加密市场，其表现就是大量机构开始配置加密资产。\n\n**机构投资者主导了牛市初期的上涨，最具有代表性的就是灰度。**灰度（GrayScale）创立于2013 年9 月25 日，是一家加密货币信托基金公司，也是加密领域最早入局者之一，其作为加密资产的管理者，帮助投资者做资产管理。它首先从合格投资人那里募集资金，募集的资金用以购买加密资产，然后将它们划分为份额，从而生成了灰度的加密投资产品，如GBTC、ETHE。灰度允许其最初创建份额的加密资产投资者（严格的合格投资人身份验证）在禁售期后可以向公众出售。\n\n公众购买灰度的加密资产产品，可以通过传统的经纪和退休金账户进行购买，而且在税收、资产保管等方面存在好处。另外灰度的这些加密资产份额也是可转让的，交易者或投资者购买之后也可以通过交易获利。这一时期大批传统机构和投资者进入加密市场，比特币价格快速上涨。\n\n**当机构主导的比特币拉升后，市场进入牛市中期，DeFi成为市场上涨的主要影响力量。**DeFi 对于应用场景的拓展进一步推升并支撑了比特币牛市。在此时期相较于比特币，机构对以太坊等DeFi领域的投资兴趣明显增加，并显示出多元化配置加密资产的倾向。之后由于以太坊性能限制，其价值红利外溢到Solana、BSC、AVAX等竞争性公链。这使得加密市场从比特币牛市，进入到一个全面爆发的大牛市阶段。\n\n而且在这一时期，特斯拉表示，将对比特币投资 15 亿美元，也要开始接受比特币作为支付产品的一种形式。随后其创始人马斯克的不断“喊单”更加重了市场的fomo情绪，逐渐将市场推向高潮。 \n \n\n**在牛市末期，比特币期货ETF获批上市，NFT市场爆发，散户主导了最后的疯狂。**这一时期，在美国控制通胀需求增加，加息缩表预期提高情况下，美联储政策转向可能性增加，加密市场外部宏观经济最大的刺激因素逐渐消失。 \n \n\n在2021年10月至11月三只比特币期货ETF获批上市，市场迎来最后的疯狂，比特币价格推高至69000美金。同期NFT市场爆发，涌现出一批优质的蓝筹NFT，散户成为参与的主力军，而在这一过程中，很多聪明的资金逐渐离场。\n\n \n \n\n**综合近两轮牛市来看，虽然导致牛市产生的因素不同，但是牛市上涨结构呈现相似性，比特币率先上涨开始新的牛市，以太坊发展将比特币牛市推向加密行业全面牛市，在牛市末期，像上一轮的比特币期货和这一轮的比特币期货ETF上市，代表比特币被传统金融接纳，这将整个牛市推向顶峰，但比特币减半依然是牛市开始的重要时间节点。**\n\n \n \n\n## 二、未来影响加密市场走势的将会有谁？\n\n \n \n\n**通过上一部分的分析，我们基本确定了以比特币减半为时间节点的牛市发展的三个阶段，那么我们尝试利用这个规律来分析一下未来加密市场走势，也就是谁将影响比特币上涨和以太坊的发展未来。**\n\n \n \n\n### 美国经济对比特币价格走势的影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n目前加密市场已经与美国宏观经济产生高度关联性，尤其是比特币与标普500指数之间的相关性已经接近0.9，我们分析比特币走势不得不关注美国的经济状况。\n\n \n \n\n在今年3月16日，美国联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议决定提升联邦基金利率区间至0.25%-0.5%，开始了本轮加息。另据美联储官员预计，基准利率到2022年年底前将升至3.4%，这意味着今年还会再加息175个基点。\n\n \n \n\n我们回顾美联储最近的三次加息周期分别发生在 1999/06-2000/05、2004/06-2006/06、2015/12-2018/12，近三次加息周期内美国经济整体均处在增长动能不断强化，同时通胀持续上行的阶段，即经济周期中的过热阶段。\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lq5GvT-AvJc8ao1C6k-HO.png?height=197&width=363)\n\n \n \n\n美联储每次开启新一轮加息周期时，股市在短期内均有不同程度的回调，其中标普500最大回调幅度在 5%-15%之间，但拉长时间来看，整个加息周期内股市在经历了回调后，最终仍会随着基本面的好转而恢复上涨，走势呈“V型”。\n\n \n \n\n**那么我们就需要分析一下目前美国经济状况与近3次加息时是相似，还是将进入大的衰退？**\n\n \n \n\n目前美国出现近40年来的高通货膨胀率，同时伴随低失业率。这次通胀的核心原因是大宗商品价格上涨，而导致大宗商品价格大涨的主要原因是美元泛滥，一方面推高了以美元计价的大宗商品价格，另一方面热钱最终会涌入大宗商品交易市场，进一步推升大宗商品价格，所以美国只能通过加息以及缩表措施，希望使得大宗商品投资降温、降价。\n\n \n \n\n在美国经济体系中消费占主导，作为消费的重要领先指标，就业市场可直接反映经济景气变化。目前美国非农就业人口新增稳定，劳动力供需关系折射美国经济韧性，中短期不会成为美联储政策收紧的掣肘因素。即美联储通过加息以及缩表压制通货膨胀之后，失业率即使上升，应该能在接受范围之内，经济进入大萧条概率较小。\n\n \n \n\n**综合来看，本次加息与之前三次所处经济状况没有太大不同，那么依据前三次规律分析，美联储加息从3月开始，下半年标普500可能触底反弹，比特币也可能将完成本轮熊市筑底。**\n\n \n \n\n### 以太坊技术发展对加密市场走势的影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n在上一轮牛市中，以太坊主网在使用人数增多时，出现了拥堵和高gas的情况，这对于生态发展产生了非常大的阻碍，而且后期资金利用率低的缺点也显现出来。以太坊扩容和基于DID系统的信用金融体系成为急需解决的问题。\n\n \n \n\n目前以太坊正在进行升级，测试网合并已经完成，之后将进行以太坊主网合并（Merge）， PoW 将切换成 PoS。合并完成之后的首要重大事项就是 EIP-4844，利用分片使rollups处理巨量的交易来增加可扩展性。Arbitrum、Optimism、zksync、StarkNet、 Polygon 这些layer2项目都可以从 EIP-4844 中获得巨大进展，这将使得越来越多的开发者涌入。\n\n \n \n\n以太坊扩容，以及其他公链的发展将为web3.0的发展打下基础，而web3.0 最初可能将是平行于现实世界的一个虚拟经济体，在这个新的经济体中，会有新的行业诞生，也会对已有行业进行重新塑造。基于DID 所建立的信用体系和声誉体系，将解决目前DeFi超额抵押导致的资金利用率低的问题。而且隐私、DAO、NFT、Gamefi 、Socalfi等赛道也必将全面爆发，这会将比特币牛市推向加密市场全面牛市。\n\n## 三、下一轮牛市全周期的预测，以及牛市对于行业内部和外部影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n我们利用比特币的历史价格周期规律，结合上面我们分析的原因来对下一个牛市周期做一个简单的分析预测。\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VsDd3QkOB7uv1WbxFERhD.png?height=803&width=1814)\n\n \n \n\n首先我们看比特币前两轮牛市顶点到熊市最低点回调周期和深度，统计显示：\n\n**第一轮牛市从最高点到熊市最低点，下跌了14个月，回调幅度87.06%**\n\n**第二轮牛市从最高点到熊市最低点，下跌了12个月，回调幅度84.78%**\n\n**第二次下跌周期和幅度较第一次都有缩短，那么基于此，本次回调至最低点的周期可能会小于12个月，回调幅度可能小于84.78%。**\n\n \n \n\n**结合上面标普500走势分析，我们认为比特币本轮熊市最低点可能出现在9-10月份，最低点价格可能在14000美金到15000美金区域。**\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A2gsmSB0AVgjERxcr_ZHa.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n \n \n\n前面已经分析过比特币减半是之后牛市开启的重要节点，每次减半之后都伴随着更大的牛市，在比特币熊市最低点到减半中间这段时间，我们可以认为是比特币调整时期，在这一时期比特币价格大体震荡略有上行。对于这个时间周期统计显示：\n\n \n \n\n**第一轮熊市最低点到减半，调整18个月**\n\n**第二轮熊市最低点到减半，调整16个月**\n\n \n \n\n**比特币下一次减半大约发生在2024年5月，在比特币触底到减半这段时间将是调整周期，而美国加息可能在今年底或者明年初结束，之后市场也进入恢复期。**\n\n \n \n\n**综合以上两点，我们预测这一时期，美股和比特币都将进入调整期。可以预判机构可能在此时期建仓，但是大幅震荡中散户可能失去信心而离场。**\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OksEN7E6Mpz4YLk7gdhC2.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n \n \n\n在减半完成后比特币开始进入拉升阶段，我们可以看下比特币减半后到牛市最高点的周期和幅度的统计：\n\n \n \n\n**第一轮牛市上涨了13个月，上涨倍数是523.87**\n\n**第二轮牛市上涨了17个月，上涨倍数是129.04**\n\n**第三轮牛市上涨了19个月，上涨倍数是 22.09**\n\n \n \n\n**从上面数据看出，每轮牛市上涨周期在增加，上涨倍数由于基数变大，在不断缩小。那么我们可以推测2024年5月之后，比特币将进入拉升阶段。随后以太坊在完成升级后，基于技术提升，生态必将更加丰富，资金利用率必然提高，整个web3.0的应用层开始爆发，这时将进入加密市场全面牛市。我们预计本轮牛市比特币上涨至最高点可能需要超过19个月的时间，上涨倍数可能低于22倍，即最高价格不超过30万美金。最终比特币现货ETF也将通过，加密市场和传统金融进一步融合。**\n\n \n \n\n综合来看，我们认为**下一轮加密市场**牛市的**内在驱动力**就是狭义的**web3.0发展**，即基于区块链技术的全新互联网进行迭代发展。**它将带来的是互联网端的生产关系革新，生产关系的变革必然也会带来生产力的创新，这将是未来互联网的发展动力**。可以预见，未来必然会有更多资本进入加密行业，成熟的加密行业应用也将开始进入人们的日常生活。\n\n \n \n\n对于在本轮牛市中崛起的NFT，可能会首先进入人们的日常生活。而基于NFT发展的Gamefi 、Socalfi也会慢慢颠覆web2.0的模式。**而且狭义的web3.0只是web3.0的初期，包括区块链、元宇宙、VR/AR、人工智能的广义web3.0必然跟随发展，这将是软件和硬件设施共同带来的科技革命。做时间的朋友，耐心等待，该来的终究会来。**\n\n \n \n\n7 O'Clock

\n\n2017年芝加哥期权交易平台（COBE）和芝加哥商品交易平台（CME）开放了比特币期货的交易，比特币第一次获得了主流金融市场的认可。最终在2017年12月比特币到达第二轮牛市的最高点19666美金。\n\n**第二轮牛市中矿业高速发展，比特币基于挖矿经济模型产生的底层价值更加稳固，这使得比特币减半对于市场的影响进一步增加，另外杠杆资金的进入，以及后来的爱西欧引入大量场外资金共同促成了第二轮牛市。** \n \n\n**同时我们看到了牛市周期的一种模式：牛市初期比特币拉升，中期以太坊的发展又推动了全面牛市，牛市末期比特币进入传统金融将市场推向最高点。这种模式第一次在牛市周期中出现，这种模式对于未来走势预判有很大参考意义。** \n \n\n### 第三轮牛市：2020年Q2～2021年Q4——疫情环境下的美联储放水以及DeFi、NFT市场爆发\n\n2020年在新冠疫情影响下，美联储释放出“零利率+无限QE”的“金融核武器”，而且拜登一上台就提出了天量的 1.9 万亿美元新冠援助计划。对于金融市场而言，拜登的 1.9 万亿新冠援助计划，就像一个的巨大泡沫。在这样巨大的泡沫下，大量资金从传统金融资产外溢到加密市场，其表现就是大量机构开始配置加密资产。\n\n**机构投资者主导了牛市初期的上涨，最具有代表性的就是灰度。**灰度（GrayScale）创立于2013 年9 月25 日，是一家加密货币信托基金公司，也是加密领域最早入局者之一，其作为加密资产的管理者，帮助投资者做资产管理。它首先从合格投资人那里募集资金，募集的资金用以购买加密资产，然后将它们划分为份额，从而生成了灰度的加密投资产品，如GBTC、ETHE。灰度允许其最初创建份额的加密资产投资者（严格的合格投资人身份验证）在禁售期后可以向公众出售。\n\n公众购买灰度的加密资产产品，可以通过传统的经纪和退休金账户进行购买，而且在税收、资产保管等方面存在好处。另外灰度的这些加密资产份额也是可转让的，交易者或投资者购买之后也可以通过交易获利。这一时期大批传统机构和投资者进入加密市场，比特币价格快速上涨。\n\n**当机构主导的比特币拉升后，市场进入牛市中期，DeFi成为市场上涨的主要影响力量。**DeFi 对于应用场景的拓展进一步推升并支撑了比特币牛市。在此时期相较于比特币，机构对以太坊等DeFi领域的投资兴趣明显增加，并显示出多元化配置加密资产的倾向。之后由于以太坊性能限制，其价值红利外溢到Solana、BSC、AVAX等竞争性公链。这使得加密市场从比特币牛市，进入到一个全面爆发的大牛市阶段。\n\n而且在这一时期，特斯拉表示，将对比特币投资 15 亿美元，也要开始接受比特币作为支付产品的一种形式。随后其创始人马斯克的不断“喊单”更加重了市场的fomo情绪，逐渐将市场推向高潮。 \n \n\n**在牛市末期，比特币期货ETF获批上市，NFT市场爆发，散户主导了最后的疯狂。**这一时期，在美国控制通胀需求增加，加息缩表预期提高情况下，美联储政策转向可能性增加，加密市场外部宏观经济最大的刺激因素逐渐消失。 \n \n\n在2021年10月至11月三只比特币期货ETF获批上市，市场迎来最后的疯狂，比特币价格推高至69000美金。同期NFT市场爆发，涌现出一批优质的蓝筹NFT，散户成为参与的主力军，而在这一过程中，很多聪明的资金逐渐离场。\n\n \n \n\n**综合近两轮牛市来看，虽然导致牛市产生的因素不同，但是牛市上涨结构呈现相似性，比特币率先上涨开始新的牛市，以太坊发展将比特币牛市推向加密行业全面牛市，在牛市末期，像上一轮的比特币期货和这一轮的比特币期货ETF上市，代表比特币被传统金融接纳，这将整个牛市推向顶峰，但比特币减半依然是牛市开始的重要时间节点。**\n\n \n \n\n## 二、未来影响加密市场走势的将会有谁？\n\n \n \n\n**通过上一部分的分析，我们基本确定了以比特币减半为时间节点的牛市发展的三个阶段，那么我们尝试利用这个规律来分析一下未来加密市场走势，也就是谁将影响比特币上涨和以太坊的发展未来。**\n\n \n \n\n### 美国经济对比特币价格走势的影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n目前加密市场已经与美国宏观经济产生高度关联性，尤其是比特币与标普500指数之间的相关性已经接近0.9，我们分析比特币走势不得不关注美国的经济状况。\n\n \n \n\n在今年3月16日，美国联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议决定提升联邦基金利率区间至0.25%-0.5%，开始了本轮加息。另据美联储官员预计，基准利率到2022年年底前将升至3.4%，这意味着今年还会再加息175个基点。\n\n \n \n\n我们回顾美联储最近的三次加息周期分别发生在 1999/06-2000/05、2004/06-2006/06、2015/12-2018/12，近三次加息周期内美国经济整体均处在增长动能不断强化，同时通胀持续上行的阶段，即经济周期中的过热阶段。\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lq5GvT-AvJc8ao1C6k-HO.png?height=197&width=363)\n\n \n \n\n美联储每次开启新一轮加息周期时，股市在短期内均有不同程度的回调，其中标普500最大回调幅度在 5%-15%之间，但拉长时间来看，整个加息周期内股市在经历了回调后，最终仍会随着基本面的好转而恢复上涨，走势呈“V型”。\n\n \n \n\n**那么我们就需要分析一下目前美国经济状况与近3次加息时是相似，还是将进入大的衰退？**\n\n \n \n\n目前美国出现近40年来的高通货膨胀率，同时伴随低失业率。这次通胀的核心原因是大宗商品价格上涨，而导致大宗商品价格大涨的主要原因是美元泛滥，一方面推高了以美元计价的大宗商品价格，另一方面热钱最终会涌入大宗商品交易市场，进一步推升大宗商品价格，所以美国只能通过加息以及缩表措施，希望使得大宗商品投资降温、降价。\n\n \n \n\n在美国经济体系中消费占主导，作为消费的重要领先指标，就业市场可直接反映经济景气变化。目前美国非农就业人口新增稳定，劳动力供需关系折射美国经济韧性，中短期不会成为美联储政策收紧的掣肘因素。即美联储通过加息以及缩表压制通货膨胀之后，失业率即使上升，应该能在接受范围之内，经济进入大萧条概率较小。\n\n \n \n\n**综合来看，本次加息与之前三次所处经济状况没有太大不同，那么依据前三次规律分析，美联储加息从3月开始，下半年标普500可能触底反弹，比特币也可能将完成本轮熊市筑底。**\n\n \n \n\n### 以太坊技术发展对加密市场走势的影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n在上一轮牛市中，以太坊主网在使用人数增多时，出现了拥堵和高gas的情况，这对于生态发展产生了非常大的阻碍，而且后期资金利用率低的缺点也显现出来。以太坊扩容和基于DID系统的信用金融体系成为急需解决的问题。\n\n \n \n\n目前以太坊正在进行升级，测试网合并已经完成，之后将进行以太坊主网合并（Merge）， PoW 将切换成 PoS。合并完成之后的首要重大事项就是 EIP-4844，利用分片使rollups处理巨量的交易来增加可扩展性。Arbitrum、Optimism、zksync、StarkNet、 Polygon 这些layer2项目都可以从 EIP-4844 中获得巨大进展，这将使得越来越多的开发者涌入。\n\n \n \n\n以太坊扩容，以及其他公链的发展将为web3.0的发展打下基础，而web3.0 最初可能将是平行于现实世界的一个虚拟经济体，在这个新的经济体中，会有新的行业诞生，也会对已有行业进行重新塑造。基于DID 所建立的信用体系和声誉体系，将解决目前DeFi超额抵押导致的资金利用率低的问题。而且隐私、DAO、NFT、Gamefi 、Socalfi等赛道也必将全面爆发，这会将比特币牛市推向加密市场全面牛市。\n\n## 三、下一轮牛市全周期的预测，以及牛市对于行业内部和外部影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n我们利用比特币的历史价格周期规律，结合上面我们分析的原因来对下一个牛市周期做一个简单的分析预测。\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VsDd3QkOB7uv1WbxFERhD.png?height=803&width=1814)\n\n \n \n\n首先我们看比特币前两轮牛市顶点到熊市最低点回调周期和深度，统计显示：\n\n**第一轮牛市从最高点到熊市最低点，下跌了14个月，回调幅度87.06%**\n\n**第二轮牛市从最高点到熊市最低点，下跌了12个月，回调幅度84.78%**\n\n**第二次下跌周期和幅度较第一次都有缩短，那么基于此，本次回调至最低点的周期可能会小于12个月，回调幅度可能小于84.78%。**\n\n \n \n\n**结合上面标普500走势分析，我们认为比特币本轮熊市最低点可能出现在9-10月份，最低点价格可能在14000美金到15000美金区域。**\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A2gsmSB0AVgjERxcr_ZHa.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n \n \n\n前面已经分析过比特币减半是之后牛市开启的重要节点，每次减半之后都伴随着更大的牛市，在比特币熊市最低点到减半中间这段时间，我们可以认为是比特币调整时期，在这一时期比特币价格大体震荡略有上行。对于这个时间周期统计显示：\n\n \n \n\n**第一轮熊市最低点到减半，调整18个月**\n\n**第二轮熊市最低点到减半，调整16个月**\n\n \n \n\n**比特币下一次减半大约发生在2024年5月，在比特币触底到减半这段时间将是调整周期，而美国加息可能在今年底或者明年初结束，之后市场也进入恢复期。**\n\n \n \n\n**综合以上两点，我们预测这一时期，美股和比特币都将进入调整期。可以预判机构可能在此时期建仓，但是大幅震荡中散户可能失去信心而离场。**\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OksEN7E6Mpz4YLk7gdhC2.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n \n \n\n在减半完成后比特币开始进入拉升阶段，我们可以看下比特币减半后到牛市最高点的周期和幅度的统计：\n\n \n \n\n**第一轮牛市上涨了13个月，上涨倍数是523.87**\n\n**第二轮牛市上涨了17个月，上涨倍数是129.04**\n\n**第三轮牛市上涨了19个月，上涨倍数是 22.09**\n\n \n \n\n**从上面数据看出，每轮牛市上涨周期在增加，上涨倍数由于基数变大，在不断缩小。那么我们可以推测2024年5月之后，比特币将进入拉升阶段。随后以太坊在完成升级后，基于技术提升，生态必将更加丰富，资金利用率必然提高，整个web3.0的应用层开始爆发，这时将进入加密市场全面牛市。我们预计本轮牛市比特币上涨至最高点可能需要超过19个月的时间，上涨倍数可能低于22倍，即最高价格不超过30万美金。最终比特币现货ETF也将通过，加密市场和传统金融进一步融合。**\n\n \n \n\n综合来看，我们认为**下一轮加密市场**牛市的**内在驱动力**就是狭义的**web3.0发展**，即基于区块链技术的全新互联网进行迭代发展。**它将带来的是互联网端的生产关系革新，生产关系的变革必然也会带来生产力的创新，这将是未来互联网的发展动力**。可以预见，未来必然会有更多资本进入加密行业，成熟的加密行业应用也将开始进入人们的日常生活。\n\n \n \n\n对于在本轮牛市中崛起的NFT，可能会首先进入人们的日常生活。而基于NFT发展的Gamefi 、Socalfi也会慢慢颠覆web2.0的模式。**而且狭义的web3.0只是web3.0的初期，包括区块链、元宇宙、VR/AR、人工智能的广义web3.0必然跟随发展，这将是软件和硬件设施共同带来的科技革命。做时间的朋友，耐心等待，该来的终究会来。**\n\n \n \n\n7 O'Clock

{"id": "ffiqECgJM4aLoHnKMY0Ol6hmNXGpTzWNukaVT3-mZ6Q", "title": "Festival of the Commons", "body": "I went to the first academic conference of my life and call me dramatic but it was such an emotional and profound experience for me, I’m literally bursting with emotions and that’s always a good reason to write. So I heard of this wonderful conference called SASE (The Society for the Advancement of Socioeconomics). I started following this organization and I saw that for 2022 the conference theme was going to be super intriguing. It was “Fractious Connections: Anarchy, Activism, Coordination and Control.” How cool is that? So many concepts that I’m interested in and since when do we acknowledge anarchy as a possibility for social organization in formal academia? I thought that there was no way I could actually present there but I wanted to go through the process of applying anyway since I would do it in the future for sure. So I wrote my proposal and submitted it. When I got the acceptance email, I had to read it three times to believe that my proposal was actually accepted. I was shocked and thrilled and then terrified because what the hell was I going to do now? I couldn’t not go after being accepted, it’s such an opportunity! But what the fuck would I present if I did go? And this has been on my mind for months now. I tried so hard to figure out my thesis research question so that I could present it for the conference but I didn’t get very far with it because I barely had any guidance specific to my topic of interest. I felt so misunderstood and alone. I didn’t belong at my own university and I felt it very deeply. And I thrive on external validation so imagine how hard it was to not give up on my ideas when I never got any. It was a very teaching experience in that I had to learn to trust my own intuition and validate myself because there will not always be someone to do that for me, especially when you take up such a controversial cause in your life as finding an alternative to capitalism. I study at a fucking business school. Obviously, my opinions aren’t very well received there and I’m not encouraged to pursue the topics I want to. It’s a Sociology program where we talk about gender in binary terms and very often only use male data in our analyses. Or we talk about how to make workers more productive. Or immigrants more integrated into German culture. Or how the only valuable production of knowledge is strictly via the quantitative scientific method. I’ve learned a lot here but I’m so glad it’s over and I can be with my people soon. And I’ve only just discovered that my people exist at this conference, so you can imagine what a relief it was!\n\nSo I moved to Berlin a few weeks ago and this was my first step to save myself, it was difficult but I did it! And it was so worth it, I can’t even tell you how much my life and my mental state have improved since I moved here. I feel like I found my home, I feel like I belong, perhaps specifically because no one belongs here. And I never feel that way! This is so new and exciting for me, I’m so happy that things are finally starting to work out for me. Anyway, with my field experiment, my friends that I needed to say hello to, all the new people I’ve been meeting, all the summer events going on, looking for a house and moving and my current state of homelessness, it was pretty busy. I didn’t really have time to do much in preparation for the conference and with only a few days left last week I freaked out. My mind went rogue and turned on me, this is the first time that I very concretely understood what imposter syndrome is. The thoughts that were spiralling in my mind!\n\n“As always you left this for the last minute, wtf are you gonna do now?”\n\n“You’re going to the first conference of your life and you didn’t even prepare your presentation yet!”\n\n“What were you even thinking applying to such a conference, you don’t belong there! Who do you think you are?!”\n\n“You used some big sexy buzzwords in your proposal of a paper that doesn’t even exist and they thought you were actually someone to invite but you tricked them. You’re nothing. You’re shit. You’re a mere master’s student who can’t even come up with a decent research question.”\n\n“You don’t have the knowledge to back up anything you wrote on that proposal and they’re gonna see you for who you are. A little girl that doesn’t even know what she’s talking about.”\n\n“Your ruse is going to be uncovered and you’re going to be humiliated. They’re gonna ask you questions and you’re not even gonna understand the question, let alone be able to give an intelligent answer to it.”\n\n“Just say you have covid and don’t show up. You don’t have to go and its so much stress, why do that to yourself?”\n\nAnd so on. You can see how cruel my mind is to me sometimes. But I’m deeply grateful for my beloved friends and family because they’re the ones that got me through it. So many positive affirmations and comforting words of encouragement. We incorporated a demo presentation into our weekly game night and I presented to my friends and they gave me so much helpful feedback. Now they also know what DAOs are and we have the idea of turning this “learning event” into a regular thing where we can all share interesting knowledge and experiences we gain in our individual lives. I love it! And I want to share some of the encouraging words they shared with me, that helped to shut up my inner saboteur.\n\n“If you don’t know something there’s nothing more natural and honest than to just say I don’t know, and there’s nothing to be ashamed about.”\n\n“You have all of the space to make any mistake you want, that’s the good part about first experiences.”\n\n“Well, we’re all imposters when you think about it. No one knows what they’re doing, we’re just going around pretending. Especially in academia.”\n\n“I have full faith that you’re going to rock this thing!”\n\n“You actually might fuck up, you know. It happens. And that’s completely okay, you’re allowed to fuck up.”\n\nAnd so much more. So I ended up going, thankfully. I was still very stressed out up to the last minute. And so much went wrong on the morning of my presentation, I just wanted to get it over with. But looking back I now know there was nothing to be afraid of. Everyone was just human. And very kind human beings at that. They were encouraging, supportive and interested. No one made a mean comment at all. There was negative feedback but it was all very constructive and considerate. And I think I did a good job! Both with the presentation and the questions after it. The negative feedback was nothing compared with all the positive feedback I got! I’m still shocked by the experience. And conferences apparently aren’t really about the papers being represented, they’re more about connecting and reconnecting. We share our ideas and talk and have fun together, we become friends. That’s the real beauty of it, it’s a social experience! And I’ve always loved the collective & social part of academia, this is a whole new level of it. So it was truly a transformative and profound experience for me.\n\nSo I’m gonna get a little emotional. It was a gathering of brilliant passionate nerds out to save the world, a thousand of them. They were scholars, they were activists, they were artists, they were comrades, they were warriors, they were full of hope and doubt, they were beautiful human beings and most importantly they were friends. After the isolation I have gotten accustomed to in my struggle, the loneliness, the crippling self-doubt, the hopelessness… finding this community changes everything. I’m not alone anymore and there are thousands of others out there fighting for the same things. The way we instantly connected was pure magic. We understood each other on such a deep level: the humor, the struggle, the coping mechanisms, the hope, the hopelessness, the things we read, the things we watch, the way we perceive life and what we want from it. I’ve never experienced something like this before. I feel like I found my people, it was so comfortable to be amongst them, and these are people that I literally just met. I knew exactly what to say around them and it was what I wanted to say, I knew I would be accepted for exactly who I am. We were united under a common purpose and struggle and everything else was irrelevant. We were from all over the world and from different backgrounds and ages and genders, but we were able to form a community. Not only do we already agree collectively that the world as we know it is fucked up, we also agree that that can be changed and that responsibility lies with us, and we have come together to discuss how we can do it. We’ve all devoted our lives to actively and passionately seeking out Alternatives to Capitalism and we’re in it together. I kinda grew up this weekend, these wonderful “adults” listened to me, they gave me the opportunity and space to express myself and my ideas resonated with them. They took me in as an equal. I am an adult, I am a sociologist, I am a scholar, I am an academic, I am an activist, I am an artist! And no one in the world can take that away from me. Despite the words of my inner saboteur, I am not an imposter and I deserve to exist and to be here just as much as anyone else and my ideas are worthy of recognition and praise. Do you realize how valuable this realization is? What an experience, I just can’t get over it. I’m bursting with so many emotions. It was stimulating, thought-provoking, inspiring, liberating, motivating, encouraging, overwhelming, comforting and it was a hell of a lot of fun! It was, in fact, a festival! But of ideas… and with a spirit of sweet sweet solidarity!\n\nI must say that there was a difference between our network and the others. We were kinda like the cool kids of the conference. The gender, age, and nationality distribution of the participants was very diverse, much more than in the other networks. I guess the concept of alternatives to capitalism attracts good people. And interesting people. Apparently normally we don’t just do the conference but we visit local communities, collectives, squats and just do other activities while we’re there. Our wonderful organizers are considering having a more informal event to meet at Christiania in Copenhagen. That would be SO MUCH FUN! I’m so happy to have found them and I will not let them go. Not only was the conference itself great, but I also had so much inspiration for my future plans. LibraryDAO is going to have such gatherings but they’re going to be even better. It will be a Festival of the Commons, an anarchist gathering where the structure of the events will be determined in a bottom-up, flexible fashion. I guess most fo us have heard of the tragedy of the commons. The problem of self-interest that leads to overexploitation when you’re sharing a depletable public good. Well, we’re gonna celebrate love and friendship and knowledge and art. None of which are depletable goods, they are economies of abundance, they will increase the more we share them. So we will have a festival of the commons! Which is not my concept btw, I stole it because I like it too much :) There’s so much we could do. It will resemble a festival even more than a traditional conference does. There will be creative activities and performances. We’ll turn the world upside down in our own little bubble. We won’t only consume together but we’ll also create together. We’ll share, we’ll sing, we’ll dance, we’ll play games! Fun will be built into the experience. I’m so excited!", "timestamp": 1658157316, "digest": "dlUxgXHu2yweSwBqWdoshjT8uZqH-PhctQIdCmRRmvY", "contributor": "0x2f41bC4A15662d341CCF866CF1603568923D170A"}

In order to gain a better context, I’d recommend you to take a look at that one before reading this case study.\n\n![Initial screenshots of their SCADA system](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yijz8x1vmyWnI1ByZCXzA.png?height=1270&width=2461&size=medium)\n\nThe first part of the project was to design a dashboard that gave an overview of the plant’s processes. The second one was to improve the experience for the plant’s controllers, which is what this case is about.\n\n\\**This particular software is only available for Desktop, and they have a fixed resolution for their screens, which made responsive irrelevant for this project.*\n\n## Discovery\n\nWhen this project started, we had already covered some ground as part of the discovery phase. Nevertheless, we were still missing to talk to the heavy users of the software: the operations team.\n\nWe had a different sessions where we went through the flows and actions of each of the different operation profiles. When we were done, we came up with rules and constrains we’d need to follow and also identified some data that wasn’t necessary and we could get rid of.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. **Make the UI cleaner and easier to read.** Almost everybody agreed that the UI was very heavy to the eyes.\n2. **Improve the way alerts were displayed.** With some many graphical elements alerts were constantly missed or ignored.\n3. **Improve the flows and navigation.** They had inconsistent navigation patterns which result in users getting lost in the interface.\n\n## Hands on\n\n### Navigation\n\nThe first thing we did was to map the software structure, so we could define a proper navigation pattern. In the end, we went for a tree structure with a Breadcrumb, that would always let the user know where they were.\n\n### Colors\n\nAs we had already defined a color palette for the Dashboard project, we just inherited it and keep working with it.\n\n### Flows\n\nIn order to understand better the flows they had, we went for a full deconstruction of the screens and try and understand what they wanted to show.\n\n![Wireframe of one of the screens (One of the first iterations)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bomViWzwUF2erCSfmjsfr.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\nWe set a weekly iterative process, where I showed my progress on Friday, we went over it, discussed it and got some initial feedback, and then they sent all the final feedback on Tuesday. Then I’d present my progress on Friday, and so on.\n\n### Iconography\n\nAfter the flows were accepted, then we went to the icon design phase, where each of the elements should be clear, but at the same time abstract enough so that they could be easily placed in the system, reducing all the clutter the images they were using before created.\n\nThe biggest challenge here was to follow the guides and constrains from the software, so we had to come up with a system for displaying all kind of different status.\n\n![General structure for different cases for each of the elements](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gzZe_TikEnOlINgkskfGP.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\n## Design System\n\nOnce the iconography was put in place, we developed a system for the developers to follow it, so they could then build all of the software following it.\n\n![Before & after of one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgLEkCNDeK8TnY-81sFsI.png?height=1363&width=4863&size=medium)\n\nWe also created a UI Kit that was shared with them as a PDF. [You can check it here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12s6WQlfojBbAdWSwTUBJcampO6kTsd9j/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Final product\n\nIn the end, we created a design system for them to build their SCADA according to their needs (Alarms, different states, processes, CTAs, etc).\n\n![Final design for one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Y-KAPCB7YCJnohGr__tG.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\nThe main improved areas were:\n\n### Made the UI cleaner and easier to read\n\nOur approach was to make the interface as clean and abstract as possible, giving more importance to actionable items than to what was working properly. This gave the operations people a clear state of their process, and told them what they had to do.\n\n### Improved the way alerts were displayed\n\nWe reduced the clutter with alerts by creating a framework for categories of them. Also, we used the red color as the alert one, generating a lot of contrast and letting the user know when something wasn’t working, right away.\n\n### Improved the flows and navigation\n\nAs part of the Information Architecture, we blended some views and separated others. We also added a proper breadcrumb with a tree view of the site, where the users is aware of where they are, all the time.\n\n### Design system in place\n\nWhen the project was done, the developers had a system that they could use to build the whole system by themselves. Until today, they haven’t asked for clarification or guidance for anything, which means the system is working properly.", "timestamp": 1658157125, "digest": "DMcT40AcNXgVsozmYQy7tJqZCbXZxPpz02deOfuA9SE", "contributor": "0xaB0684A4AA2Bb286C7a6b7E7E9b5f660cb062A3d"}

《韩非子·解老》*\n\n**引言**：华尔街有一句名言，平庸的交易者用技术交易，顶尖的交易者用信念交易。信念的产生是源于对于规律的认知，掌握事物发展的规律，合理布局是我们在市场生存的重要条件。\n\n加密市场也正在按照自身的规律不断向前发展，比特币已经历三轮牛市，但是引发每一轮牛市产生的具体要素有所不同。不过我们能够清晰的看到，比特币减半都成了牛市到来的重要节点，而以太坊技术的发展、传统资金的流入、金融杠杆的增加使得市场进入全面牛市。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/15oQiFWF_pV_LyHg4laAh.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n下文7 O’Clock Capital将通过分析过往三轮牛市形成的具体原因，对下一轮牛市做出预测。\n\n## 一、三轮加密市场牛市上涨，在其中起着重要作用的都有谁？\n\n### 第一轮牛市: 2012年Q4～2013年Q4——匿名支付需求量的增加\n\n**2009年1月3日**，中本聪在芬兰使用小型服务器挖出了比特币创世区块，比特币由此诞生。\n\n**2010年5月22日**，佛罗里达程序员拉斯勒·豪涅茨，花10000比特币在“棒约翰”叫了两块匹萨外卖，从此比特币开始逐渐开启现实世界的使用。\n\n**2011年**，比特币开始在匿名支付领域被使用，但是直到2012年维基解密为了打破封锁，开始接收比特币的捐助，才使得比特币的使用范围大幅增加。\n\n随着比特币减半和丝绸之路2.0的开启，使得比特币供给相对减少，而需求进一步增加，比特币价格不断攀升，最终在2013年11月到达第一轮牛市最高点1163美金。\n\n**第一轮牛市最大的意义是比特币进入匿名支付领域，有了现实应用，并且带动了价格的蹿升。这使得挖矿变得越来越流行，参与者也随之增多，由矿机和电力成本构建的经济模型开始运转，成为比特币底层的价值支撑，从而使得比特币减半对于价格影响增加。**\n\n### 第二轮牛市: 2016年Q3～2017年Q4——矿业的高速发展以及爱西欧吸引资金入场\n\n2015年矿业高速发展，国内的鱼池与蚂蚁矿池形成了两强相争的局面，这两家矿池算力之和最高时达到了整个矿业算力的50%。这一时期大量资金购买矿机进入矿池挖矿，由于需求的增加，矿机得以以10倍于制造成本的价格来销售，并且是以期货的形式出售，这些相当于加了杠杆的资金大量进入加密市场，推高了比特币价格，反过来比特币价格上涨，又促进了矿机的销售，形成了上涨的螺旋。同期USDT出现，并且迅速被各大交易平台使用，尤其是在亚洲，他的桥梁作用和价值稳定性方便更多用户进入加密市场。这些原因导致的需求增加，以及比特币减半的到来，对于开启新的比特币牛市起到了关键作用。\n\n2014年7月的以太坊是迄今为止最大的“爱西欧”之一，筹措资金超过1800万美元。2015年以太坊为代表的智能合约区块链平台逐渐成熟，尤其是ERC-20协议只需短短几分钟就能创建出一个新的Token，此举大大降低了区块链创业和爱西欧发行的成本，爱西欧几乎成为区块链创业企业融资的标配。基于区块链技术的创业项目井喷，让没有赶上比特币红利的投资者开始把目光转向爱西欧，之后各种传统投资机构的不断入场，进一步将第二轮牛市从比特币牛市推向全面牛市。 \n \n\n2017年芝加哥期权交易平台（COBE）和芝加哥商品交易平台（CME）开放了比特币期货的交易，比特币第一次获得了主流金融市场的认可。最终在2017年12月比特币到达第二轮牛市的最高点19666美金。\n\n**第二轮牛市中矿业高速发展，比特币基于挖矿经济模型产生的底层价值更加稳固，这使得比特币减半对于市场的影响进一步增加，另外杠杆资金的进入，以及后来的爱西欧引入大量场外资金共同促成了第二轮牛市。** \n \n\n**同时我们看到了牛市周期的一种模式：牛市初期比特币拉升，中期以太坊的发展又推动了全面牛市，牛市末期比特币进入传统金融将市场推向最高点。这种模式第一次在牛市周期中出现，这种模式对于未来走势预判有很大参考意义。** \n \n\n### 第三轮牛市：2020年Q2～2021年Q4——疫情环境下的美联储放水以及DeFi、NFT市场爆发\n\n2020年在新冠疫情影响下，美联储释放出“零利率+无限QE”的“金融核武器”，而且拜登一上台就提出了天量的 1.9 万亿美元新冠援助计划。对于金融市场而言，拜登的 1.9 万亿新冠援助计划，就像一个的巨大泡沫。在这样巨大的泡沫下，大量资金从传统金融资产外溢到加密市场，其表现就是大量机构开始配置加密资产。\n\n**机构投资者主导了牛市初期的上涨，最具有代表性的就是灰度。**灰度（GrayScale）创立于2013 年9 月25 日，是一家加密货币信托基金公司，也是加密领域最早入局者之一，其作为加密资产的管理者，帮助投资者做资产管理。它首先从合格投资人那里募集资金，募集的资金用以购买加密资产，然后将它们划分为份额，从而生成了灰度的加密投资产品，如GBTC、ETHE。灰度允许其最初创建份额的加密资产投资者（严格的合格投资人身份验证）在禁售期后可以向公众出售。\n\n公众购买灰度的加密资产产品，可以通过传统的经纪和退休金账户进行购买，而且在税收、资产保管等方面存在好处。另外灰度的这些加密资产份额也是可转让的，交易者或投资者购买之后也可以通过交易获利。这一时期大批传统机构和投资者进入加密市场，比特币价格快速上涨。\n\n**当机构主导的比特币拉升后，市场进入牛市中期，DeFi成为市场上涨的主要影响力量。**DeFi 对于应用场景的拓展进一步推升并支撑了比特币牛市。在此时期相较于比特币，机构对以太坊等DeFi领域的投资兴趣明显增加，并显示出多元化配置加密资产的倾向。之后由于以太坊性能限制，其价值红利外溢到Solana、BSC、AVAX等竞争性公链。这使得加密市场从比特币牛市，进入到一个全面爆发的大牛市阶段。\n\n而且在这一时期，特斯拉表示，将对比特币投资 15 亿美元，也要开始接受比特币作为支付产品的一种形式。随后其创始人马斯克的不断“喊单”更加重了市场的fomo情绪，逐渐将市场推向高潮。 \n \n\n**在牛市末期，比特币期货ETF获批上市，NFT市场爆发，散户主导了最后的疯狂。**这一时期，在美国控制通胀需求增加，加息缩表预期提高情况下，美联储政策转向可能性增加，加密市场外部宏观经济最大的刺激因素逐渐消失。 \n \n\n在2021年10月至11月三只比特币期货ETF获批上市，市场迎来最后的疯狂，比特币价格推高至69000美金。同期NFT市场爆发，涌现出一批优质的蓝筹NFT，散户成为参与的主力军，而在这一过程中，很多聪明的资金逐渐离场。\n\n \n \n\n**综合近两轮牛市来看，虽然导致牛市产生的因素不同，但是牛市上涨结构呈现相似性，比特币率先上涨开始新的牛市，以太坊发展将比特币牛市推向加密行业全面牛市，在牛市末期，像上一轮的比特币期货和这一轮的比特币期货ETF上市，代表比特币被传统金融接纳，这将整个牛市推向顶峰，但比特币减半依然是牛市开始的重要时间节点。**\n\n \n \n\n## 二、未来影响加密市场走势的将会有谁？\n\n \n \n\n**通过上一部分的分析，我们基本确定了以比特币减半为时间节点的牛市发展的三个阶段，那么我们尝试利用这个规律来分析一下未来加密市场走势，也就是谁将影响比特币上涨和以太坊的发展未来。**\n\n \n \n\n### 美国经济对比特币价格走势的影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n目前加密市场已经与美国宏观经济产生高度关联性，尤其是比特币与标普500指数之间的相关性已经接近0.9，我们分析比特币走势不得不关注美国的经济状况。\n\n \n \n\n在今年3月16日，美国联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议决定提升联邦基金利率区间至0.25%-0.5%，开始了本轮加息。另据美联储官员预计，基准利率到2022年年底前将升至3.4%，这意味着今年还会再加息175个基点。\n\n \n \n\n我们回顾美联储最近的三次加息周期分别发生在 1999/06-2000/05、2004/06-2006/06、2015/12-2018/12，近三次加息周期内美国经济整体均处在增长动能不断强化，同时通胀持续上行的阶段，即经济周期中的过热阶段。\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lq5GvT-AvJc8ao1C6k-HO.png?height=197&width=363)\n\n \n \n\n美联储每次开启新一轮加息周期时，股市在短期内均有不同程度的回调，其中标普500最大回调幅度在 5%-15%之间，但拉长时间来看，整个加息周期内股市在经历了回调后，最终仍会随着基本面的好转而恢复上涨，走势呈“V型”。\n\n \n \n\n**那么我们就需要分析一下目前美国经济状况与近3次加息时是相似，还是将进入大的衰退？**\n\n \n \n\n目前美国出现近40年来的高通货膨胀率，同时伴随低失业率。这次通胀的核心原因是大宗商品价格上涨，而导致大宗商品价格大涨的主要原因是美元泛滥，一方面推高了以美元计价的大宗商品价格，另一方面热钱最终会涌入大宗商品交易市场，进一步推升大宗商品价格，所以美国只能通过加息以及缩表措施，希望使得大宗商品投资降温、降价。\n\n \n \n\n在美国经济体系中消费占主导，作为消费的重要领先指标，就业市场可直接反映经济景气变化。目前美国非农就业人口新增稳定，劳动力供需关系折射美国经济韧性，中短期不会成为美联储政策收紧的掣肘因素。即美联储通过加息以及缩表压制通货膨胀之后，失业率即使上升，应该能在接受范围之内，经济进入大萧条概率较小。\n\n \n \n\n**综合来看，本次加息与之前三次所处经济状况没有太大不同，那么依据前三次规律分析，美联储加息从3月开始，下半年标普500可能触底反弹，比特币也可能将完成本轮熊市筑底。**\n\n \n \n\n### 以太坊技术发展对加密市场走势的影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n在上一轮牛市中，以太坊主网在使用人数增多时，出现了拥堵和高gas的情况，这对于生态发展产生了非常大的阻碍，而且后期资金利用率低的缺点也显现出来。以太坊扩容和基于DID系统的信用金融体系成为急需解决的问题。\n\n \n \n\n目前以太坊正在进行升级，测试网合并已经完成，之后将进行以太坊主网合并（Merge）， PoW 将切换成 PoS。合并完成之后的首要重大事项就是 EIP-4844，利用分片使rollups处理巨量的交易来增加可扩展性。Arbitrum、Optimism、zksync、StarkNet、 Polygon 这些layer2项目都可以从 EIP-4844 中获得巨大进展，这将使得越来越多的开发者涌入。\n\n \n \n\n以太坊扩容，以及其他公链的发展将为web3.0的发展打下基础，而web3.0 最初可能将是平行于现实世界的一个虚拟经济体，在这个新的经济体中，会有新的行业诞生，也会对已有行业进行重新塑造。基于DID 所建立的信用体系和声誉体系，将解决目前DeFi超额抵押导致的资金利用率低的问题。而且隐私、DAO、NFT、Gamefi 、Socalfi等赛道也必将全面爆发，这会将比特币牛市推向加密市场全面牛市。\n\n## 三、下一轮牛市全周期的预测，以及牛市对于行业内部和外部影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n我们利用比特币的历史价格周期规律，结合上面我们分析的原因来对下一个牛市周期做一个简单的分析预测。\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VsDd3QkOB7uv1WbxFERhD.png?height=803&width=1814)\n\n \n \n\n首先我们看比特币前两轮牛市顶点到熊市最低点回调周期和深度，统计显示：\n\n**第一轮牛市从最高点到熊市最低点，下跌了14个月，回调幅度87.06%**\n\n**第二轮牛市从最高点到熊市最低点，下跌了12个月，回调幅度84.78%**\n\n**第二次下跌周期和幅度较第一次都有缩短，那么基于此，本次回调至最低点的周期可能会小于12个月，回调幅度可能小于84.78%。**\n\n \n \n\n**结合上面标普500走势分析，我们认为比特币本轮熊市最低点可能出现在9-10月份，最低点价格可能在14000美金到15000美金区域。**\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A2gsmSB0AVgjERxcr_ZHa.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n \n \n\n前面已经分析过比特币减半是之后牛市开启的重要节点，每次减半之后都伴随着更大的牛市，在比特币熊市最低点到减半中间这段时间，我们可以认为是比特币调整时期，在这一时期比特币价格大体震荡略有上行。对于这个时间周期统计显示：\n\n \n \n\n**第一轮熊市最低点到减半，调整18个月**\n\n**第二轮熊市最低点到减半，调整16个月**\n\n \n \n\n**比特币下一次减半大约发生在2024年5月，在比特币触底到减半这段时间将是调整周期，而美国加息可能在今年底或者明年初结束，之后市场也进入恢复期。**\n\n \n \n\n**综合以上两点，我们预测这一时期，美股和比特币都将进入调整期。可以预判机构可能在此时期建仓，但是大幅震荡中散户可能失去信心而离场。**\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OksEN7E6Mpz4YLk7gdhC2.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n \n \n\n在减半完成后比特币开始进入拉升阶段，我们可以看下比特币减半后到牛市最高点的周期和幅度的统计：\n\n \n \n\n**第一轮牛市上涨了13个月，上涨倍数是523.87**\n\n**第二轮牛市上涨了17个月，上涨倍数是129.04**\n\n**第三轮牛市上涨了19个月，上涨倍数是 22.09**\n\n \n \n\n**从上面数据看出，每轮牛市上涨周期在增加，上涨倍数由于基数变大，在不断缩小。那么我们可以推测2024年5月之后，比特币将进入拉升阶段。随后以太坊在完成升级后，基于技术提升，生态必将更加丰富，资金利用率必然提高，整个web3.0的应用层开始爆发，这时将进入加密市场全面牛市。我们预计本轮牛市比特币上涨至最高点可能需要超过19个月的时间，上涨倍数可能低于22倍，即最高价格不超过30万美金。最终比特币现货ETF也将通过，加密市场和传统金融进一步融合。**\n\n \n \n\n综合来看，我们认为**下一轮加密市场**牛市的**内在驱动力**就是狭义的**web3.0发展**，即基于区块链技术的全新互联网进行迭代发展。**它将带来的是互联网端的生产关系革新，生产关系的变革必然也会带来生产力的创新，这将是未来互联网的发展动力**。可以预见，未来必然会有更多资本进入加密行业，成熟的加密行业应用也将开始进入人们的日常生活。\n\n \n \n\n对于在本轮牛市中崛起的NFT，可能会首先进入人们的日常生活。而基于NFT发展的Gamefi 、Socalfi也会慢慢颠覆web2.0的模式。**而且狭义的web3.0只是web3.0的初期，包括区块链、元宇宙、VR/AR、人工智能的广义web3.0必然跟随发展，这将是软件和硬件设施共同带来的科技革命。做时间的朋友，耐心等待，该来的终究会来。**\n\n \n \n\n7 O'Clock

Then I’d present my progress on Friday, and so on.\n\n### Iconography\n\nAfter the flows were accepted, then we went to the icon design phase, where each of the elements should be clear, but at the same time abstract enough so that they could be easily placed in the system, reducing all the clutter the images they were using before created.\n\nThe biggest challenge here was to follow the guides and constrains from the software, so we had to come up with a system for displaying all kind of different status.\n\n![General structure for different cases for each of the elements](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gzZe_TikEnOlINgkskfGP.png?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n## Design System\n\nOnce the iconography was put in place, we developed a system for the developers to follow it, so they could then build all of the software following it.\n\n![Before & after of one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgLEkCNDeK8TnY-81sFsI.png?height=1363&width=4863&&size=medium)\n\nWe also created a UI Kit that was shared with them as a PDF. [You can check it here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12s6WQlfojBbAdWSwTUBJcampO6kTsd9j/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Final product\n\nIn the end, we created a design system for them to build their SCADA according to their needs (Alarms, different states, processes, CTAs, etc).\n\n![Final design for one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Y-KAPCB7YCJnohGr__tG.png?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n### Made the UI cleaner and easier to read\n\nOur approach was to make the interface as clean and abstract as possible, giving more importance to actionable items than to what was working properly. This gave the operations people a clear state of their process, and told them what they had to do.\n\n### Improved the way alerts were displayed\n\nWe reduced the clutter with alerts by creating a framework for categories of them. Also, we used the red color as the alert one, generating a lot of contrast and letting the user know when something wasn’t working, right away.\n\n### Improved the flows and navigation\n\nAs part of the Information Architecture, we blended some views and separated others. We also added a proper breadcrumb with a tree view of the site, where the users is aware of where they are, all the time.\n\n### Design system in place\n\nWhen the project was done, the developers had a system that they could use to build the whole system by themselves. Until today, they haven’t asked for clarification or guidance for anything, which means the system is working properly.", "timestamp": 1658157655, "digest": "gfm1jgsazDpmk97WG_RN0Y8KH-hvUp15w-Z8ao9sGz4", "contributor": "0xaB0684A4AA2Bb286C7a6b7E7E9b5f660cb062A3d"}

个时期）。目标是在 4 年内发行 10 亿个 Evmos 代币。\n\n由于网络的长期技术上出现通货紧缩，**Evmos 被视为具有无上限供应的代币**,如果奖励被认为太低，团队鼓励社区在第 4 年之后选择替代通胀模型。例如：如果奖励被认为太低，社区可以提出线性或恒定模型。\n\n**EVMOS期望用于：**\n\n1\\.通过内置的共享费用收入模式（dApp Store）向开发人员和网络运营商支付服务费用\n\n2\\.对协议升级进行投票\n\n3\\.在 ERC20 模块上注册代币，用于 EVM-IBC 与 ERC20 的集成\n\n4\\.为 Evmos上的应用程序分配使用奖励\n\n5\\.为有用的高优先级功能启用预编译\n\n目前主要用途:质押、IBC 转账、治理存款\n\n**换算单位：**\n\n1 evmos = 1 \\* 10^{18} aevmos\n\n**创世代币分配：**\n\n初始供应：2亿\n\n战略基金：40%\n\n空投：50%\n\n社区池：10%\n\n![创世代币分配](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fRNEagudzBUrsQjcaI0Qo.png?height=398&width=700)\n\n**新发行的代币分配：**\n\n质押奖励：40%\n\n团队归属：25%\n\n使用奖励：25%\n\n社区池：10%\n\n![新发行代币分配](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1bDjwQjNh4_bR3JutSNFJ.png?height=398&width=700)\n\n![4年后代币分配](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KrngRVpJPZK-0a22wpneM.png?height=398&width=700)\n\n**战略基金：**\n\n将由基金会拥有的 multisig DAO 控制，用于通过赠款为计划提供资金，包括提供中继服务、构建浏览器、维护开源工具和部署显示网络整体市场增长的仪表板。\n\n**空投：**\n\n奖励 Cosmos 和 Ethereum 社区的活跃用户并刺激生态系统。\n\n**团队归属：**\n\n每个时期 25% 的代币将发给 Evmos 协议的开发人员。这 2 亿个 Evmo 代币面临悬崖并正在归属。在发布之前，这些将不可转让或可质押。\n\n**社区池：**\n\n社区池资金由governance控制，用于引导重要的工具、基础设施、教育内容和其他资源。社区池可用于追溯公共产品资金（链接至 Optimism）\n\n**使用奖励：**\n\n流向一个专门用于激励用户的池（gas补贴、流动性挖矿）\n\n**费用：**\n\nEvmos 的费用根据网络使用情况定价。Gas 定价基于[EIP1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md)。但我们没有烧掉基本费用，而是重新分配并投入资金。\n\n**DApp商店：**\n\n在 Evmos 中，fees不再只是燃烧或只增加网络运营商的网络所有权份额的资金。Evmos 现在通过内置的共享费用收入模型在开发人员和网络运营商之间分配费用作为他们服务的奖励。这种收入模式/费用分配称为 dApp Store。\n\n                                                                 **EVMOS链上治理**\n\n**链上治理作用：**\n\nEvmos 的链上治理机制，用于传递文本提案、更改链参数以及从社区池中支出资金。\n\n**链上治理细节：**\n\n在 Tendermint Core 共识引擎的支持下，Evmos 使用一组 150 个验证器，这些验证器运行完整节点并通过广播包含由私钥签名的加密签名的投票来参与链上治理。验证者不仅向链上提议和提交新区块，而且还通过对社区提案进行投票来参与链上资金治理。作为他们工作的回报，验证者以 Evmos 代币的形式获得收入。每个验证者的投票影响力取决于他们的代币权重（即，作为抵押品）。代币可以由验证者直接质押，也可以由 Evmos 持有者委托给他们。\n\n委托人是 Evmos 代币的持有者，他们不能或不想自己运行完整节点。这些利益相关者将他们的代币委托给验证者，并获得一部分质押收入以换取他们的委托。委托人必须进行尽职调查并对他们选择的验证人负责，因为双方不仅分享质押收入，还分享因验证人不当行为而可能发生的任何削减处罚。委托人可以选择更改他们对验证人的选择。委派给投票权百分比较低的验证者有助于确保网络的去中心化，因此委派者在整体网络健康中发挥着积极和关键的作用。\n\n根据 Cosmos SDK 的说法，如果代币委托人没有对提案进行投票，它将继承其验证人的投票。\n\n**EVMOS团队介绍**\n\n**费德里科·昆泽·库尔默：**\n\nEvmos 联合创始人兼董事也是是Sommelier的联合创始人，曾任 Interchain 软件工程师、ChainSafe Systems 和 Kava Labs 技术主管。拥有 4

TVL公链排名第68名，TVL为744万，而统计在上面的协议只有12个，大部分为DEX,而Mcap/tvl达到了57\n\n![EVMOS](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Tsfmn7brEnftsyRDSmC8k.png?height=406&width=553)\n\n![Moonbean](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V4142VflbNRdx1ymDl4Pm.png?height=424&width=553)\n\n对标波卡上兼容EVM的公链Moonbean，Moonbean在上面排名24名，TVL为1.58亿，Mcap/tvl为1.28，链上协议有26个，占比较大的协议为Moonwell、Stellaswap和Curve。相比Moonbean来说Evmos市值和质押量比值还是比较大，质押量占比最大的是Diffusion Finance，占了34.11%,TVL为253万\n\nEVMOS上线价格为3.8左右，目前EVMOS在CMC上报价为2.06 USDT，相比其它代币，EVMOS在这一波熊市下跌中表现还算是坚挺，而目前的供应量大概是3亿，但是实际流通量没有这么多，很大一部分空投未领取\n\n![供应曲线](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a_0wWOQbaOlMR83YOK2uL.png?height=434&width=554)\n\n而中心化交易所目前上了MEXC，在CEX交易占比为80.7%，DEX交易主要集中在Osmosis和Diffusion\n\n6月22号，dYdX宣布其v4版本将作为基于Cosmos SDK和Tendermint共识的独立区块链推出，相信对于整个COSMOS生态来说都是利好的，而对于兼容EVM的EVMOS来说，在其高吞吐量、快速交易、低手续费及生态补贴的特性下，相信未来会有更多的协议选择部署在EVMOS或者去兼容EVMOS,让我们拭目以待吧\n\n**最后**\n\n截止到2022年7月18号，在EVMOS上空投代币只索赔了2469万，还有近7500万的空投代币未领取，到8月2号未领取的代币数量将开始进行衰减，直到10月1号将全部流入社区池。未领取的要尽快去领取\n\n![空投页面](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YaAbtYubDldbN3unBNBiV.png?height=393&width=553)\n\n领取代币后也可以选择质押节点，目前的质押收益还不错，而且COSMOS生态项目的惯例是针对生态的参与用户进行空投，例如：质押、添加LP等。有一点值得注意的是，质押EVMOS解锁需要14天的一个锁定期\n\n**相关链接：**\n\nEVMOS官网：<https://evmos.org/>\n\nEVMOS文档：<https://docs.evmos.org/>\n\nEVMOS推特：<https://twitter.com/EvmosOrg>\n\nEVMOS电报：<https://t.me/EvmosOrg> (英文）\n\nEVMOS电报：<https://t.me/evmos_zh> (中文）\n\nEVMOS

个时期）。目标是在 4 年内发行 10 亿个 Evmos 代币。\n\n由于网络的长期技术上出现通货紧缩，**Evmos 被视为具有无上限供应的代币**,如果奖励被认为太低，团队鼓励社区在第 4 年之后选择替代通胀模型。例如：如果奖励被认为太低，社区可以提出线性或恒定模型。\n\n**EVMOS期望用于：**\n\n1\\.通过内置的共享费用收入模式（dApp Store）向开发人员和网络运营商支付服务费用\n\n2\\.对协议升级进行投票\n\n3\\.在 ERC20 模块上注册代币，用于 EVM-IBC 与 ERC20 的集成\n\n4\\.为 Evmos上的应用程序分配使用奖励\n\n5\\.为有用的高优先级功能启用预编译\n\n目前主要用途:质押、IBC 转账、治理存款\n\n**换算单位：**\n\n1 evmos = 1 \\* 10^{18} aevmos\n\n**创世代币分配：**\n\n初始供应：2亿\n\n战略基金：40%\n\n空投：50%\n\n社区池：10%\n\n![创世代币分配](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fRNEagudzBUrsQjcaI0Qo.png?height=398&width=700)\n\n**新发行的代币分配：**\n\n质押奖励：40%\n\n团队归属：25%\n\n使用奖励：25%\n\n社区池：10%\n\n![4年后代币分配](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KrngRVpJPZK-0a22wpneM.png?height=398&width=700)\n\n**战略基金：**\n\n将由基金会拥有的 multisig DAO 控制，用于通过赠款为计划提供资金，包括提供中继服务、构建浏览器、维护开源工具和部署显示网络整体市场增长的仪表板。\n\n**空投：**\n\n奖励 Cosmos 和 Ethereum 社区的活跃用户并刺激生态系统。\n\n**团队归属：**\n\n每个时期 25% 的代币将发给 Evmos 协议的开发人员。这 2 亿个 Evmo 代币面临悬崖并正在归属。在发布之前，这些将不可转让或可质押。\n\n**社区池：**\n\n社区池资金由governance控制，用于引导重要的工具、基础设施、教育内容和其他资源。社区池可用于追溯公共产品资金（链接至 Optimism）\n\n**使用奖励：**\n\n流向一个专门用于激励用户的池（gas补贴、流动性挖矿）\n\n**费用：**\n\nEvmos 的费用根据网络使用情况定价。Gas 定价基于[EIP1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md)。但我们没有烧掉基本费用，而是重新分配并投入资金。\n\n**DApp商店：**\n\n在 Evmos 中，fees不再只是燃烧或只增加网络运营商的网络所有权份额的资金。Evmos 现在通过内置的共享费用收入模型在开发人员和网络运营商之间分配费用作为他们服务的奖励。这种收入模式/费用分配称为 dApp Store。\n\n                                                                 **EVMOS链上治理**\n\n**链上治理作用：**\n\nEvmos 的链上治理机制，用于传递文本提案、更改链参数以及从社区池中支出资金。\n\n**链上治理细节：**\n\n在 Tendermint Core 共识引擎的支持下，Evmos 使用一组 150 个验证器，这些验证器运行完整节点并通过广播包含由私钥签名的加密签名的投票来参与链上治理。验证者不仅向链上提议和提交新区块，而且还通过对社区提案进行投票来参与链上资金治理。作为他们工作的回报，验证者以 Evmos 代币的形式获得收入。每个验证者的投票影响力取决于他们的代币权重（即，作为抵押品）。代币可以由验证者直接质押，也可以由 Evmos 持有者委托给他们。\n\n委托人是 Evmos 代币的持有者，他们不能或不想自己运行完整节点。这些利益相关者将他们的代币委托给验证者，并获得一部分质押收入以换取他们的委托。委托人必须进行尽职调查并对他们选择的验证人负责，因为双方不仅分享质押收入，还分享因验证人不当行为而可能发生的任何削减处罚。委托人可以选择更改他们对验证人的选择。委派给投票权百分比较低的验证者有助于确保网络的去中心化，因此委派者在整体网络健康中发挥着积极和关键的作用。\n\n根据 Cosmos SDK 的说法，如果代币委托人没有对提案进行投票，它将继承其验证人的投票。\n\n**EVMOS团队介绍**\n\n**费德里科·昆泽·库尔默：**\n\nEvmos 联合创始人兼董事也是是Sommelier的联合创始人，曾任 Interchain 软件工程师、ChainSafe Systems 和 Kava Labs 技术主管。拥有 4

一种开源和非托管流动性协议，用于赚取存款和借贷资产的利息。Evmos 还将使跨链应用程序能够利用 AAVE 的流动性，同时部署到 Terra 等其他 Cosmos 链。**（以太坊上借贷协议，已发币）**\n\n**Saddle Finance**---是 Evmos 区块链上的去中心化自动化做市商，针对锚定价值加密资产（如稳定币和打包 BTC）进行了优化。**（以太坊上AMM，已发币）**\n\n**Diffusion Finance**---是 Uniswap v2 的一个分支。它将成为 Evmos 的首批 AMM 之一，这是 Cosmos 上的 EVM，它利用 Cosmos SDK 实现围绕可组合性、互操作性和快速终结性的用例。**（EVMOS上TVL最大DEX，已公布代币空投规则）**\n\n**Coslend**---是 Evmos 生态系统中第一个基于 Compound 的货币市场，Compound 是最大的 DeFi 协议之一。我们的目标是创建一个安全、开放、透明的去中心化金融货币市场。**（未发币，部分已快照，空投详情：<https://docs.coslend.com/airdrops>）**\n\n**Cronus Finance**---Cronus Finance 是基于 Evmos 构建的完全无需许可且可组合的 AMM。**（已发币）**\n\n**FRAX**---为用户提供了对 DeFi 生态系统的更大可访问性，因为稳定币与法定货币挂钩，但本身作为加密货币存在，允许与去中心化协议轻松交互。**（算法稳定币）**\n\n**EvmoSwap** ---是 Evmos 链上的去中心化交易所（DEX）。**（代币已IEO，测试网有空投，**可检查：**https://app.evmoswap.org/airdrops）**\n\n**42T Finance** --- 股权流动性。赚取增强奖励。**（目前还无官网）**\n\n**Evmos Domains** --- Evmos Domains 是一种分散式名称服务，用于将 .evmos 名称链接到地址等数据。**（可注册域名体验）**\n\n### NFT:\n\n**Orbit Market** ---EvmosOrg 上的第一个 NFT 市场。\n\n**Tofu NFT**---是最大的 GameFi、DeFi 和收藏品多链 NFT 市场。\n\n**Treasureland** --- 是一个跨链 NFT 平台，用于 NFT 发行、NFT 交易、NFT 收藏和量身定制的店内服务。\n\n### Launchpad:\n\n**DEXPAD**---去中心化 Launchpad 协议。\n\n**Tool:**\n\n**Band Protocol**---安全、可扩展的跨链去中心化预言机，将智能合约连接到外部数据和 API。\n\n**Evmos.Space** ---跟踪 Evmos 上所有最新项目的项目发现门户。\n\n**EVMOS的现状**\n\n目前Evmos在Defi Llama TVL公链排名第68名，TVL为744万，而统计在上面的协议只有12个，大部分为DEX,而Mcap/tvl达到了57\n\n![EVMOS](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Tsfmn7brEnftsyRDSmC8k.png?height=406&width=553)\n\n![Moonbean](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V4142VflbNRdx1ymDl4Pm.png?height=424&width=553)\n\n对标波卡上兼容EVM的公链Moonbean，Moonbean在上面排名24名，TVL为1.58亿，Mcap/tvl为1.28，链上协议有26个，占比较大的协议为Moonwell、Stellaswap和Curve。相比Moonbean来说Evmos市值和质押量比值还是比较大，质押量占比最大的是Diffusion Finance，占了34.11%,TVL为253万\n\nEVMOS上线价格为3.8左右，目前EVMOS在CMC上报价为2.06 USDT，相比其它代币，EVMOS在这一波熊市下跌中表现还算是坚挺，而目前的供应量大概是3亿，但是实际流通量没有这么多，很大一部分空投未领取\n\n![供应曲线](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a_0wWOQbaOlMR83YOK2uL.png?height=434&width=554)\n\n而中心化交易所目前上了MEXC，在CEX交易占比为80.7%，DEX交易主要集中在Osmosis和Diffusion\n\n6月22号，dYdX宣布其v4版本将作为基于Cosmos SDK和Tendermint共识的独立区块链推出，相信对于整个COSMOS生态来说都是利好的，而对于兼容EVM的EVMOS来说，在其高吞吐量、快速交易、低手续费及生态补贴的特性下，相信未来会有更多的协议选择部署在EVMOS或者去兼容EVMOS,让我们拭目以待吧\n\n**最后**\n\n截止到2022年7月18号，在EVMOS上空投代币只索赔了2469万，还有近7500万的空投代币未领取，到8月2号未领取的代币数量将开始进行衰减，直到10月1号将全部流入社区池。未领取的要尽快去领取\n\n![空投页面](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YaAbtYubDldbN3unBNBiV.png?height=393&width=553)\n\n领取代币后也可以选择质押节点，目前的质押收益还不错，而且COSMOS生态项目的惯例是针对生态的参与用户进行空投，例如：质押、添加LP等。有一点值得注意的是，质押EVMOS解锁需要14天的一个锁定期\n\n**相关链接：**\n\nEVMOS官网：<https://evmos.org/>\n\nEVMOS文档：<https://docs.evmos.org/>\n\nEVMOS推特：<https://twitter.com/EvmosOrg>\n\nEVMOS电报：<https://t.me/EvmosOrg> (英文）\n\nEVMOS电报：<https://t.me/evmos_zh> (中文）\n\nEVMOS

The second one was to improve the experience for the plant’s controllers, which is what this case is about.\n\n\\**This particular software is only available for Desktop, and they have a fixed resolution for their screens, which made responsive irrelevant for this project.*\n\n## Discovery\n\nWhen this project started, we had already covered some ground as part of the discovery phase. Nevertheless, we were still missing to talk to the heavy users of the software: the operations team.\n\nWe had a different sessions where we went through the flows and actions of each of the different operation profiles. When we were done, we came up with rules and constrains we’d need to follow and also identified some data that wasn’t necessary and we could get rid of.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. **Make the UI cleaner and easier to read.** Almost everybody agreed that the UI was very heavy to the eyes.\n2. **Improve the way alerts were displayed.** With some many graphical elements alerts were constantly missed or ignored.\n3. **Improve the flows and navigation.** They had inconsistent navigation patterns which result in users getting lost in the interface.\n\n## Hands on\n\n### Navigation\n\nThe first thing we did was to map the software structure, so we could define a proper navigation pattern. In the end, we went for a tree structure with a Breadcrumb, that would always let the user know where they were.\n\n### Colors\n\nAs we had already defined a color palette for the Dashboard project, we just inherited it and keep working with it.\n\n### Flows\n\nIn order to understand better the flows they had, we went for a full deconstruction of the screens and try and understand what they wanted to show.\n\n![Wireframe of one of the screens (One of the first iterations)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bomViWzwUF2erCSfmjsfr.png?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=medium)\n\nWe set a weekly iterative process, where I showed my progress on Friday, we went over it, discussed it and got some initial feedback, and then they sent all the final feedback on Tuesday. Then I’d present my progress on Friday, and so on.\n\n### Iconography\n\nAfter the flows were accepted, then we went to the icon design phase, where each of the elements should be clear, but at the same time abstract enough so that they could be easily placed in the system, reducing all the clutter the images they were using before created.\n\nThe biggest challenge here was to follow the guides and constrains from the software, so we had to come up with a system for displaying all kind of different status.\n\n![General structure for different cases for each of the elements](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gzZe_TikEnOlINgkskfGP.png?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=medium)\n\n## Design System\n\nOnce the iconography was put in place, we developed a system for the developers to follow it, so they could then build all of the software following it.\n\n![Before & after of one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgLEkCNDeK8TnY-81sFsI.png?height=1363&width=4863&&&size=medium)\n\nWe also created a UI Kit that was shared with them as a PDF. [You can check it here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12s6WQlfojBbAdWSwTUBJcampO6kTsd9j/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Final product\n\nIn the end, we created a design system for them to build their SCADA according to their needs (Alarms, different states, processes, CTAs, etc).\n\n![Final design for one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Y-KAPCB7YCJnohGr__tG.png?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=medium)\n\n### Made the UI cleaner and easier to read\n\nOur approach was to make the interface as clean and abstract as possible, giving more importance to actionable items than to what was working properly. This gave the operations people a clear state of their process, and told them what they had to do.\n\n### Improved the way alerts were displayed\n\nWe reduced the clutter with alerts by creating a framework for categories of them. Also, we used the red color as the alert one, generating a lot of contrast and letting the user know when something wasn’t working, right away.\n\n### Improved the flows and navigation\n\nAs part of the Information Architecture, we blended some views and separated others. We also added a proper breadcrumb with a tree view of the site, where the users is aware of where they are, all the time.\n\n### Design system in place\n\nWhen the project was done, the developers had a system that they could use to build the whole system by themselves. Until today, they haven’t asked for clarification or guidance for anything, which means the system is working properly.", "timestamp": 1658157886, "digest": "rs_6EBis05shTcwkFD5nPgnSVVkRmLhvTT8vn8_A5y8", "contributor": "0xaB0684A4AA2Bb286C7a6b7E7E9b5f660cb062A3d"}

They’re the ones in charge of providing Bilbao with clean water, as well as purifying the wastewater created.\n\nAs a product designer for DigitaLinkers, my task was to re-design their SCADA system (A SCADA is a central controller for industrial machinery).\n\n![Homepage before the project started](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QPKgmNucsRGYbh0rVoVbi.png?height=742&width=1440&size=medium)\n\n\\**This particular software is only available for Desktop, and they have a fixed resolution for their screens, which made responsive irrelevant for this project.*\n\n## Discovery\n\nIn the discovery phase of the process, we identified 2 main users who would interact with the system on a constant basis: Management and operations. We run a Design thinking workshop where we went deep in this topic and identified areas to work on, as well as defined both users’ interests.\n\n![Pictures from the design thinking workshop](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4g1cL0TbsrdX8nfMA84z5.png?height=708&width=1160&size=medium)\n\n## Users\n\n### Management\n\nInterested in the overall functioning of the plant. They want to know everything is working fine, and if there’s something they should be aware of.\n\n### Operations\n\nInterested in their area. If there’s an issue and they’re responsible for it, they have to be aware of what’s going on, and take actions on it.\n\n## Areas to work on\n\n### Usability\n\nOne of the biggest pain points they had is that the initial page was unable to understand if you had no experience with it. The main driver for this project was to have a system that was more usable by all of the profiles involved.\n\n### Accessibility\n\nThe SCADA is used 24/7 in different kind of screens (from 23” to 60” screens) and in different environments, so sometimes it was very tiring to look at.\n\n## Constrains\n\nAs this is a 3rd party software where integrators were doing their magic on top of it, it came with a couple limitations and design constrains that we had to work with.\n\n1. There were limitations in terms of charts and information we could display\n2. There was a pre-defined way of showing errors that would be followed\n\nAs this was my first (and only so far) SCADA project, we had a very close relationship with the developers, where I needed their guidance on the Do’s and Don’ts for the project.\n\n## Hands on\n\n### UI\n\nOne of the first decisions we made was to reduce all the color weight the interface had to make it more readable. Also, we went through a process where we defined the data and tried to put it all together in one screen.\n\n### Data definition\n\nDuring the workshop we created a doc where we wrote down the data each of the profiles needed to be displayed in the initial dashboard.\n\nAfterwards, we went through a definition process to discover which data was really important, what we could get rid of, and what was missing.\n\nThis was a weekly iterative process, where I showed my progress on Friday, we went over it, discussed it and got some initial feedback, and then they sent all the final feedback on Tuesday. Then I’d present my progress on Friday, and so on.\n\n![Data definition iterations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nb-D4rMrZWSCszOutBkjY.png?height=700&width=3096&size=medium)\n\n### Data visualization\n\nOnce data was somewhat defined (there were still some unknowns, but we were confident we could finish this as the process advanced), we moved on to a DataViz phase. We used the same iteration model, where we were validating weekly our decisions.\n\n![DataViz iterations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wxNftUn_Kml_XQDukWIwL.png?height=1080&width=5792&size=medium)\n\n## Final result\n\n![Final Dashboard design](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HS1m3rKKN4ysvLULtPDhc.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\nIn the end, the client was happy with it, and the initial feedback I got from it was very positive, so you could say the final result was a good one.\n\nSadly, when you work for an agency most of the times you don’t follow the project after you deliver it, so I don’t have actual data to see how the system is performing and what should be improved - there’s always something to be improved.\n\n![Before & after](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NB9vjL_GzuZdDL2sX9ZBL.png?height=742&width=2776&size=medium)\n\nNevertheless, from the agency they still say the client is satisfied, so I take that as a win 🙂", "timestamp": 1658158343, "digest": "cu7xHwMS-2Cjj5clO1uVwkxV5_MPrYEePYeq6YQ0ffI", "contributor": "0xaB0684A4AA2Bb286C7a6b7E7E9b5f660cb062A3d"}

Maybe it’s not people/ pets though. Maybe it’s freedom, independence, or worldly experiences. Maybe it’s your health and wellness. Maybe it’s Power, Fame, Success. My point being, we place value on a number of different things in our life today.\n\nWhat does the “world” value today?\n\nA hybrid of the things above potentially, but also the value of the USD.\n\nThere is a colloquial saying, “Cash is King,” meaning cash is more valuable than any other form of investment tools. Whether you agree with this sentiment or not, how did “cash” become so valuable?\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-is-king.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-is-king.asp)\n\nWell I’ll give you a pencil and napkin summary here.\n\nFirst it started during the Hunter Age, when people traded crops and cattle. Then, people started going to war and wealth got a bad rep. The Warrior Age created value for the king and if you survived, receiving land was most valuable. People then began forming modern day cities. Useful and decorative crafts became valuable. As cities started to change the landscape, the idea to explore far away lands became a thing so exotic goods became valuable. Craftsmen kept perfecting their skills at home and afar and the introduction of machinery allowed for things to be mass produced so value was created significantly faster. Around this same time, transportation and the demand for fuel was growing. Insert Rockefeller’s and Getty’s of the world. Now fast forward to the Corporate Age, with transportation demands solved, distributions of factory goods was possible to/from anywhere. Corporations formed from factories with growing departments. With the corporations growing, Banks realized they could buy corporations and resell them. Insert the evolution Fed and corporations now creating value in the order of billions of USD. With corporations employing hundreds of people, people spending money, and banks managing transactions… a significant amount of data was accumulating. Hence the rapid development of technology to manage and organize this data. As technology has evolved, the importance of the security and integrity of this data has caused us to re-evaluate how this data is managed through the evolution of blockchain technology. Now we see are starting to see what we value physically, digitally. \n\n[https://blog.adioma.com/the-history-of-creating-value-infographic/](https://blog.adioma.com/the-history-of-creating-value-infographic/)\n\nThe value of the Euro is predicted to reach $.97 USD by September WSJ reported this morning. Tiktok influencers are flocking to Europe to grab hold of their Gucci, Prada, Coco and Chanel bags for almost half the price they are in the states. Meanwhile I’m back here wondering if I should get a pet chicken with the cost of eggs rising. All comments aside though, I do wonder how the changing value of the US dollar will impact our future and particularly cryptocurrency?\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/strong-dollar-extends-gains-with-no-end-to-rally-in-sight-11658066581](https://www.wsj.com/articles/strong-dollar-extends-gains-with-no-end-to-rally-in-sight-11658066581)\n\n(Additionally, WSJ reported the WSJ Dollar Index, the index that measures the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, hit a 20 year high last week and is nearly up 2.5% this month. They also reported the Fed was likely to raise rates by another .75 percentage points this month and are doing what they can to stop rising consumer prices.)\n\nOn the future value of currency and its impact on cryptocurrency… some economic theories at play as depicted in Bankless’ interview with Lyn Alden.\n\n[http://podcast.banklesshq.com/127-is-this-the-end-lyn-alden](http://podcast.banklesshq.com/127-is-this-the-end-lyn-alden)\n\n1\\. Long Term Debt Cycles: These macroeconomic trends resurface every several decades and each cycle is slightly different but the climax is consistently triggered by massive debt, threadbare interest rates, and currency devaluation. These factors combine to destabilize global systems, meaning ends of eras on a global scale: failing empires, wars, currency rebases, major demographic shifts. Decelerating growth, runway inflation, deep downtrends… when they hit the employment market…. its already a recession. Dalio predicts our next recession to be a catalyst for a transition from US-based dominance of the global economy to a multi polar world. Russia, China, India… they’ve already begun detaching from the dollar dominance in the midst of their own financial crises.\n\n2\\. Opposing Milkshake Theory: The idea that the global financial upheaval upon which we seem to be flirting will actually be good news for dollar strength as the American economy will ultimately drink everyone else’s milkshake and re-assert global dominance. Many think this is only true until its not and some predict that short term dollar strength may actually be an indicator of long-term dollar decline. This is because the US Dollar is a global reserve currency. It’s the currency that most offshore debt is denominated in all over the world and $13 trillion in US denominated debt exist globally and over 50 trillion in US financial assets. With disruption in global cash flows, there is a short squeeze of the dollar and so it spikes upwards. Not really a strength but rather an unfolding weakness of other currencies. Ultimately this leads to an acceleration of the mega-macro move to multi-polarity which diminishes the global reliance on US economy and its dollar. Many signs pointing to this being only months away.\n\n3\\. The Fed: Move Slow and Break Stuff: The Fed has been slow to respond to inflation, so now its stuck to move overly aggressively to catch up as economic activity is decelerating. Until the Fed breaks treasuries and credit markets, they will continue to raise rates. It is unlikely they can continue to raise rates until 2023, but they will not stop until it breaks the system. TBD.\n\nHow does this impact the crypto market: Interest rate hikes will likely be bad for the crypto market in the short term and right now digital assets are getting hit hard until this all plays out. The Merge is a secret weapon for Ethereum, but crypto as an asset is not really driving the macro environment. The Fed really has much bigger fish to fry right now. Of note the CeFi contagion took out scores of notable crypto banks to the tune of hundred of billions of dollars in just a number of weeks. Crypto is just a precursor to what we’ll see in its legacy equivalent. Infrastructure of crypto, web3, and DeFi have survived one deleveraging stress test but we shall see if they can continue with flying colors.\n\nAxios Crypto reported that Stablecoins are the current focus of regulatory efforts. Bitcoin, which started as a peer-to-peer cash system has worked thus far because retail can't know what it will be worth from day to day. So far stablecoins haven’t disrupted shit. (currently 154B) Without regulation, a stablecoin that enters the mainstream of the financial system and is widely used as a means of payments and/or store of value in multiple jurisdictions could pose significant risks to financial stability. Hence, why no stablecoins are even close to mainstream. However, credit card companies are getting ready now for the possibility as reflected in a recent WSJ article. However, the article fails to mention exactly how credit card companies are implementing crypto and also companies that are facilitating crypto for card payments already.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-is-coming-to-your-credit-cards-11657374215](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-is-coming-to-your-credit-cards-11657374215)\n\nCelsius, a blockchain technology that allowed its customers to earn interest on their cryptocurrency deposits, officially declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. They will remain in business, but now take time to pay off their debts. How they are branding it… “opportunity to stabilize their business and consummate a comprehensive restructuring transaction that maximize value for stakeholders.”\n\nBad news: There is no clear timeline for when its 300K active users with >$100USD in balances will be able to make withdrawals.\n\nI would expect some layoffs @ Celsius and on top of that Celsius faces a lawsuit against its former investment manager accusing them of being a “Ponzi Scheme.”\n\nA calendar hold for… September 19th. The new anticipated date of the the Merge, which I discussed in previous writings and referred to above.\n\n[https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-dev-confirms-perpetual-date-for-pos-merge](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-dev-confirms-perpetual-date-for-pos-merge)\n\nTo bring this all together… last week I took the Enneagram test, which is a personality trait test that is categorized into nine different types. My dominate type was the “Enthusiast” or Type 7. Based on this type, I spend a significant amount of time and am strongly influenced in my behaviors and decision-making by what is called the “Head Center” of Intelligence. In short, I think a lot about the question, “How do I navigate the future?” This fear based type pays a lot of attention to what’s going to happen in the future and who/what I can trust to provide guidance through it. This type often struggles with anxiety- trying to outsmart it, outrun it, or allowing it to determine my decisions. \n\nWhat we value… past, present, and future, is consistently evolving. While it is important to being thinking about these things… the future, the state of currency, what is valuable… we can’t forget to take a step back and just be present. \n\nWill leave you with an interesting find in the NFT space below. \n\nUtility… overused terms these days in my mind. But nonetheless there are a number of use cases being deployed right within the NFT space and sharing an interesting one.\n\nRevulution NFTs\n\nWhat are they? They are actual certificates of subscription ownership in the form of NFTs. You can now transfer your subscriptions to another person. You can send them as a gift or resell it on the market. If, for some reason you don’t want to use the subscription for a certain period of time, you can rent the NFT and earn a passive income or use it as a collateral for a loan with the launch of protocols on the Cardano network.\n\nHeres the breakdown? You buy the Netflix for life NFT, you pay $349 USD. Then you decide to use it over the next 5 years. The cost of Netflix is $10/month, $120/year, over the course of those five years you save $600 bucks and your Netflix NFT will not use value if you use the subscription.\n\nWhere’s the catch? Only UK and EU citizen can use them (excluding Malta, Germany, and Austria). Subscriptions include Netflix + Spotify\n\nTill next time… keep on keepin it real.

When you design systems that try to anticipate how complex organizations will act, you make a set of assumptions. Some of those assumptions will be correct, and some will be wrong.\n\nUltimately, it’s the **constant testing of those assumptions that allow systems to evolve into sophisticated, well-oiled machines.**\n\nAnd so, when you prematurely optimize DAOs, you end up with a system that’s often anticipating the wrong problems and thus creating complicated solutions to address problems the DAO does not yet have. This anticipation and problem-solving introduces new sets of assumptions into a system.\n\nWhen you introduce more assumptions, it becomes increasingly difficult to pinpoint why a system is failing – is it because of assumption A or assumption B? The more assumptions you have, the harder it is to figure out which assumptions are wrong and which are right.\n\nSo why do we prematurely optimize?\n\nFear of failure. We think if we anticipate problems now, we can design our way out of those challenges.\n\nBut often the opposite is true. In fact, it is this fear of failure that costs time and money in the long-run, as we lose the data and learnings that come from constantly testing assumptions (learning which assumptions are wrong and which are right).\n\n# The Evolutionary Organization\n\nThe key to building complex systems is not designing complexity from the start. Instead, it’s about building simple systems, allowing them to fail, and iterating on those systems based on what works and what does not work.\n\nThis is [Gall’s Law](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:gall_s_law) in action.\n\nOne important note: in these systems, failure isn’t just inevitable – it’s actually helpful. By constantly testing assumptions and maximizing learning, **these systems become evolutionary organizations.**\n\n# Flexibility\n\nBut evolutionary organizations don’t just optimize for learning – they also optimize for flexibility. Flexible systems allow organizations to leverage learnings and make incremental improvements (constantly testing assumptions!).\n\nWhen it comes to DAOs (and anything on-chain for that matter), flexibility is rarely designed into systems.\n\nBut it really should be.\n\nModularity is the name of the game in this regard. Unlike monolithic DAO implementations, modular DAO implementations allow for quick testing and iterations, which ultimately allow organizations to evolve quickly and efficiently.\n\nOften when we think about flexibility in systems design, it comes with trade-offs – typically around things like security. But flexibility doesn’t necessarily require sacrificing security. Using tools like [pods](https://www.orcaprotocol.org/), DAOs can build modular systems, which maintain security at the local pod level, while enabling flexibility at the DAO level.\n\n# Becoming Evolutionary\n\nSo you want to build an evolutionary organization, anon?\n\n**Start simple.** Stop trying to design the most sophisticated governance system. Start with something simple and evolve from there.\n\n**Fail intentionally.** Make assumptions. Test those assumptions. Repeat.\n\n**Build modular.** Think about your organization as a car. You can swap out parts and it’ll still run just fine.\n\n<br><br><br>\n\nPod-pilled? Ready to go modular? Well you’re in luck – we’ve got some big announcements coming up.

Hence, they needed a way to create a task for their team.\n\n## Discovery\n\nAs part of the discovery process we had client interviews and input from the Customer Success team. Based on it, we created a list of requirements we needed to fulfill when creating a task:\n\n1. A title for the task\n2. A description for the task\n3. Any attachments that were relevant for the assignee to complete the task\n4. There were 2 modes\n   1. Simple task\n   2. Task with To-dos\n5. Had to be scheduled for a specific day\n   1. Could have a specific completion time\n   2. Could be a one time task\n   3. Could be a repetitive task\n      1. Repetitive tasks had a set of different variations\n6. Had to be assigned to different people\n   1. Could be assigned to individuals\n   2. Could be assigned to the whole store\n\n![Initial design for the task creation flow](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_6YXJqNlndKYV5hvyBJro.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n## Decisions\n\nAs it was a lot of information, we decided to break the creation into a step by step flow that reduced the cognitive noise and help them focus on the task at hand. It ended up being divided into a 4 section flow.\n\n![Step by step process for the task creation flow](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LrZhTccgYeAMLUunI7bDw.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n### Details\n\nThe details section grouped everything that was related with the information the Assignee needed to know in order to be able to complete the task:\n\n* Title\n* Description\n* Attachments\n\n![Task details](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o0u6bmedomK1yPmTw0fVr.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n### To dos\n\nDuring the validation process we realised there were 2 main type of tasks: The ones that were a simple confirmation task (I’ve made it), while other required more actions. The actions that we identified during our research were:\n\n* Checklist (sub-tasks)\n* Take a picture\n* Attach a file\n* Write something\n* Multiple choice\n* Rating\n\nBased on this, the second part of the flow was focused on helping the user choose what type of task to create.\n\n![Different options to select the type of to-do to add to the task (or not)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uA6K8KC82sN8ojkLVF1mS.png?height=900&width=1620)\n\n### Schedule\n\nAlso as part of our research and the data we had from the platform, we realised users created more repeating tasks than one time ones. That’s why we made this the default option. Also, we added the “Advanced settings” feature, which gave the users the flexibility to schedule their tasks with very complex settings while keeping it simple at first sight.\n\n![Different options for scheduling a task](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y8b40fy7ArOeGE_pQDxG4.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n### Assign\n\nThe last step of the flow was who to assign the task to. Users had the option to assign the task to a whole location where just 1 person from that location could complete it (Close the store, for example) and it’d be completed for everyone who belong to that store, or to a specific individual.

{"id": "rGSheRvt8xDZSoEzUAxQ5vaFQskioR-uB6UdYcLyj7s", "title": "The Token Compensation Paradox: Losing Reputation To Earn Money.", "body": "***This piece was written in collaboration with [Eliot Couvat](https://twitter.com/CDTEliot) to expand upon the thoughts we shared on “[De-Financializing Social Tokens](https://kairon.mirror.xyz/O_yvXUWh73LtfEJ3AdUQtZEPFK8dPp5Zmynf9qx-uYc)”, we figured now more than ever would be the best time to get this conversation started in tokenized communities and DAOs. If you’d like to check out Eliot’s amazing writing on Social Tokens [make sure to follow him on Substack!](https://eliotc.substack.com/)***\n\n\n---\n\nMany people took the leap into Web3 and started contributing to DAOs because of the excitement of being paid in tokens.\n\nThat’s because, unlike traditional salaries, tokens offered them almost unlimited upside (similar to equities), and contributors could earn a lot without bringing upfront capital.\n\nBut, continuing their journey and becoming increasingly involved in several projects, more contributors realized their tokens also provided them ownership, a voice over future strategic decisions, and unlocked new perks in specific communities.\n\nAnd, after some time, many contributors found themselves stuck with their tokens, wanting to take profit, and make a living salary, but not at the expense of their voice and their reputation.\n\n[https://twitter.com/samspurlin/status/1525613447240634371](https://twitter.com/samspurlin/status/1525613447240634371)\n\nSo how do we solve this Token Compensation Paradox that’s blocking DAOs and contributors from scaling and moving towards new horizons? Well, if we want to address the problem in-depth and re-think an entire compensation model used by thousands of DAOs, first we need to understand the underlying issues that come with the current situation.\n\n## 1 - Beyond The Reputation Problem\n\nThe contributor compensation problem goes well beyond the simple struggle of sacrificing your reputation to make a livable salary.\n\nWith the compensation model we've built, we're heading toward wider inequalities within DAOs, more social pressure for contributors, and an ever increasing amount of DAOs failing due to this unsustainable model.\n\nIndeed, if we want to pride ourselves in building new organizations, reinventing governance and political models; it's essential to separate voice from pay - otherwise, we're just building pure oligarchies and exacerbating inequality.\n\nTo illustrate how this model could eventually backfire on DAOs, here’s a real world example of what happens when you tie a person’s bags with their political power: Sweden used a financially weighted voting system until 1910, the number of votes that one could have was proportional to their wealth. This resulted in a couple of individuals having more than half the votes in several dozen municipalities - almost like perfectly legal dictators.\n\n[https://twitter.com/fkpxls/status/1531306137856909312](https://twitter.com/fkpxls/status/1531306137856909312)\n\nFor DAOs to [compete with traditional companies](https://eliotc.substack.com/p/working-for-a-dao-how-thousands-of), we should do away with the social pressure that comes with selling tokens. No contributor should have to \"short\" the DAO and go against their beliefs to pay the bills; nor should they harm or quit a community they believe in, simply because they can't afford to keep their tokens. And the problem goes even further; because the incentives are not aligned, the current compensation scenario can even make the most active contributors hurt the community, their regular sales negatively impacting the token's price and harming the decentralization potential of decision making. All of this, mind you, within the confines of the community they value most.\n\nYour most fervent believers shouldn’t be getting paid exclusively in the same type of virtual currency they use on a day to day basis to make decisions, grow their reputation, and push the DAO forward. By tying their payout to your DAO’s native token, you’re sacrificing the diversity of opinions you aim to nurture, and harming your project as a whole.\n\nIf we want to create new compensation models, we must rethink them from the ground up and align incentives between the DAO growth and contributors.\n\nSo how do we do that?\n\n## 2 - Betting On The Long Term\n\nQuite a few obvious ideas come to mind, and some have even been tested out. A handful of people argue that DAOs should pay salaries with Social tokens and use NFTs for reputation. Others have suggested paying contributors only in USDC, or creating two tokens, one for governance and the other as a source of liquidity.\n\nWhile all those solutions seem promising, implementing or defining any of them as the de facto compensation model for DAOs would be missing the big picture.\n\nSocial tokens are much more liquid than NFTs, and allow communities to reward their contributors in a much more streamlined manner. They work particularly well as a reputation system and engage contributors towards exploring everything your community has to offer. Using them simply as a way to compensate contributors would simply kill their utility and their reason to exist. There's no such thing as an NFT that generates continuous engagement and rewards your daily contributors' loyalty.\n\nAs the Music NFT's artist [Xcelencia](https://twitter.com/Xcelencia) mentioned [in an interview](https://learn.trybonfire.xyz/case-studies-interviews/interview-with-xcelencia-equis-1) talking about the way he manages his community:\n\n> *\"I see social tokens as this continuous engagement. I treat it as a sort of loyalty or rewards program where I can keep everyone in and have them contribute in new and different ways.*\n>\n> *Whereas I see NFTs as these 'big moments' or highlights, the things you really want to commemorate like a great song, you want to put it out as an NFT. It's a different type of engagement.\"*\n\n**Dissociating social tokens from reputation would kill your contributors' engagement, and so would paying them only in USDC.**\n\nPaying contributors in USDC would mean firstly not sharing ownership (a core principle of DAOs), and secondly, forgetting that most DAOs usually don't have a financially liquid treasury beyond their tokens. Tokens are a great way to share \"future\" upside and recognize the effort of early contributors.\n\nPaying contributors in USDC and providing governance tokens to decentralized decisions would surely solve the problem in the short term, but it would also end up nurturing a community without any values beyond the next paycheck.\n\n**Something very similar would happen if you choose to create two tokens - one for salary and one for governance.**\n\nWhile some may believe this solves the liquidity problem while retaining the \"real\" token's intrinsic value, what you're really doing is cutting your community's potential in half by distracting your message and limiting the true capabilities of tokenization.\n\nBesides, the value offered by governance, access, and reputation can be incentive enough in some cases, just not in an everyday scenario for your average contributor. It's not unheard of to see social tokens being sold in \"black markets\" of sorts for non-negligible prices based on the value they offer alone. So, in the end, the 2nd token would need liquidity anyway, and the problem would still be the same.\n\nAll of those failed experiments showed us one thing. We have to see past our shared baggage of Web2 compensation models, where the main way to get compensated is to get a salary once a task is done. Web3 technologies are offering us new ways to share the value created while attributing the merit to the right people, and we must seize this opportunity to build better coordination models and organizations.\n\n## 3 - It’s Time To Come Up With Revolutionary Ideas\n\nSure, *“We’rE So EarLy”* - and there might not be any clear-cut solutions to contributor compensation yet. But we are optimists, and there are so many experiments we could run.\n\nWhat about exploring ways to fix this token compensation paradox from a protocol-side. There are so many Web3 native solutions and mechanics which would enable a more fair distribution of funds without compromising a social token’s in-built utility, governance, or compliance with securities’ laws. Think about mechanics such as staking, delegation of governance power based on merit, and emission curves. In DAOs with diversified treasuries, we could also envision contributors hand-picking their desired mix of stablecoins (or any token in the treasury) and the DAO token for compensation through customizable smart contracts. In the beginning, contributors would want more stability (90-10 mix), but as they entrench themselves in your community, the more they would tip the scales towards reputation (50-50).\n\nFinally, another interesting solution has recently popped into the scene: tying your reputation to soul-bound tokens and on-chain credentials. While our platforms still have a long way to go in terms of security and actual use-cases for this type of tokens, the promise is there for a non-speculative asset that serves the only purpose of being your web3 ticket to access based on merit. By properly leveraging Soulbound Tokens and offering enough flexibility in their properties, communities could have the key to proper liquidity through their tokens, without compromising their contributor’s reputation, or the DAO’s treasury.\n\nWe can play around with the formulae for due recognition of work however we please, even involving systems that may or may not pay people **before** they complete a certain task based on their already accrued merit. We need only look at the chain, social tokens, NFTs, and all of the other tools we have at our disposal to make this process human-centric and token-enabled.\n\n## Closing thoughts\n\nWe really are just scratching the surface in how we approach the future of work.\n\nWeb3 projects are very different beasts to your average Silicon Valley startup. In order to find a way to compensate the people making all of this happen, we could explore the seasonality of DAOs, our product cycles and monetization. There’s so much to experiment with when it comes to people’s relationship to impact, legacy and the future they want to see.

Hence, they needed a way to create a task for their team.\n\n## Discovery\n\nAs part of the discovery process we had client interviews and input from the Customer Success team. Based on it, we created a list of requirements we needed to fulfill when creating a task:\n\n1. A title for the task\n2. A description for the task\n3. Any attachments that were relevant for the assignee to complete the task\n4. There were 2 modes\n   1. Simple task\n   2. Task with To-dos\n5. Had to be scheduled for a specific day\n   1. Could have a specific completion time\n   2. Could be a one time task\n   3. Could be a repetitive task\n      1. Repetitive tasks had a set of different variations\n6. Had to be assigned to different people\n   1. Could be assigned to individuals\n   2. Could be assigned to the whole store\n\n![Initial design for the task creation flow](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_6YXJqNlndKYV5hvyBJro.png?height=900&width=1600&size=medium)\n\n## Decisions\n\nAs it was a lot of information, we decided to break the creation into a step by step flow that reduced the cognitive noise and help them focus on the task at hand. It ended up being divided into a 4 section flow.\n\n![Step by step process for the task creation flow](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LrZhTccgYeAMLUunI7bDw.png?height=900&width=1600&size=medium)\n\n### Details\n\nThe details section grouped everything that was related with the information the Assignee needed to know in order to be able to complete the task:\n\n* Title\n* Description\n* Attachments\n\n![Task details](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o0u6bmedomK1yPmTw0fVr.png?height=900&width=1600&size=medium)\n\n### To dos\n\nDuring the validation process we realised there were 2 main type of tasks: The ones that were a simple confirmation task (I’ve made it), while other required more actions. The actions that we identified during our research were:\n\n* Checklist (sub-tasks)\n* Take a picture\n* Attach a file\n* Write something\n* Multiple choice\n* Rating\n\nBased on this, the second part of the flow was focused on helping the user choose what type of task to create.\n\n![Different options to select the type of to-do to add to the task (or not)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uA6K8KC82sN8ojkLVF1mS.png?height=900&width=1620&size=medium)\n\n### Schedule\n\nAlso as part of our research and the data we had from the platform, we realised users created more repeating tasks than one time ones. That’s why we made this the default option. Also, we added the “Advanced settings” feature, which gave the users the flexibility to schedule their tasks with very complex settings while keeping it simple at first sight.\n\n![Different options for scheduling a task](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y8b40fy7ArOeGE_pQDxG4.png?height=900&width=1600&size=medium)\n\n### Assign\n\nThe last step of the flow was who to assign the task to. Users had the option to assign the task to a whole location where just 1 person from that location could complete it (Close the store, for example) and it’d be completed for everyone who belong to that store, or to a specific individual. We referenced Whatsapp and Facebook’s way of doing this in mobile, and mixed it with our specific needs.\n\n![Different states for the task assign step](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zITH2QQydiAZmlZoXJwm0.png?height=900&width=1600&size=medium)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n![All steps of the process](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4TVUut97y-mHcVgEUV2f-.png?height=900&width=1620&size=medium)\n\nIn the end, we came up with a flow that took users smoothly through the whole task creation process, assuring them they were doing that they wanted to do and guiding them all the time. This had a high rate of acceptance and rose task creation metrics, which made it a successful project.", "timestamp": 1658159890, "digest": "XPCEtwgwZsw1brsDl00ffgGEdujqTMWnNMivw9GGotU", "contributor": "0xaB0684A4AA2Bb286C7a6b7E7E9b5f660cb062A3d"}

I prefer to call it meta:verses as I believe that, just like the \"websites of the internet\", \"galaxies/planets of the universe\", the metaverse is going to be based on 'verses' that will have different functions/mechanisms & use cases.\n\nGamefied NFTs: AKA “Artistic Arcade Metaverses”, a concept derived/coined by me as an indie game dev & an amateur generative artist which involves \"crafting imaginary AI play into art pieces blended with interactive arcade inspired by classic retros or hyper-casual games that will be built & hosted alongside dynamic mechanisms on the blockchain\" & just like single pages of the web, these are simple/single or non-fungible verses of the metaverse.\n\nAs the NFT community evolves: we see different forms of creations, scaling from 1/1 arts to PFPs, from music NFTs to photography & a lot more; but the concept of having NFTs as games might seem new but will be understandable by a lot of people if exposed & will help create a fun filled community as challenges could be created by individuals or teams as I call it; a league of \"non-fungible gamers\" & unlike casual NFTs, these will be multiple editions based or ERC1155 because they are meant to be played by 'people'.\n\nThe concept of gamefied NFTs is both exclusive & inclusive, as all games are hosted on multiple servers like IPFS or itch.io, and these will provide links alongside these crafts that makes it shareable by exclusive owners to non-owners to make it inclusive unlike other NFTs. With these, a lot of indie game devs will be able to hop into the NFT scene as a whole new community of creatives, presently we see a lot of passionate indie game devs running down the drain or struggling to be recognized, as they are not given actual opportunities to expose their cranky creations because big game studios are dominating the scene, but with decentralization & the rise of gamefied NFTs, they'd be able to create exclusive games for the community & with that keep the passion alive. And these way game lovers who would like to play or replay some of these classics are given an opportunity.\n\nIn the blockchain: These could also be used as a medium of token creation, using the $ASH ecosystem & mechanism as an example which Pak tagged \"a token of creation through destruction\" where art pieces released under the ecosystem can be directly burned & used to create new tokens which are directly distributed to the owners/burners as a reward unlike the actual burning system across blockchains. This I site as the second phase of my crafts that I tagged \"Gamefied Fungibility & Interoperability\" this is the part where all gamefied NFTs are merged & can be achieved by either creating an AI blockchain protocol or actual AI blockchain that will power these creations; For (1) Fungibility: Just like $ASH, thousands/millions of gamefied NFTs built by creative devs will be directly burned by owners after playing, as a decentralized means of mining new fungible/social tokens & in return acts as a reward for playing, more like a little 'Play2Earn' games. This will be valued & dynamically balanced by the AI system & by the community using it. This will also serve as a medium of ‘burning’ NFTs & earn an arcade game as a reward… For (2) Interoperability: With an AI system that has the ability to communicate with multi-chains, interoperable transactions will be carried out with a little fee, moving NFTs from one chain to the other will be made easy and will also trigger the minting of new gamefied NFTs to the wallet of the person who carries out this transaction.\n\nIn the actual immersive metaverse: gamefied NFTs will become gem-like collectible mini-games, having read/watched things like \"ready player one\" where we see many mini games coming into play as a form of quest or just a fun play & some actually involving the authors of the OASIS, we could state an example to say to access a certain weapon you must complete this mini game,\n\nor just function as a sort of collectible to boast of like pokemon cards but played in a 2d virtual screen built within these 3d immersive worlds. We could have thousands of it placed across different part of \"meta:verses\" as actual arcade machines but will be more artistic as against the \"retro times\" where coins were inserted to play but here crypto(s) will be inserted to access these.\n\n“The metaverse” just like I stated earlier wouldn't be just immersive worlds, as we are already seeing mechanisms that will be super important in the metaverse, why others are waiting for a single immersive 3D MMORPG as a metaverse, the mechanisms are being put into play, like Pak's \"merge/mass\" this I believe is an actual metaverse of mechanism that is \"play/game\" based. Then the metaverse/meta:verses will be gradually scaled to virtual worlds of fantasies, stories, or just fun based immersive extensions of the internet.\n\nLet's build the metaverse bit by bit: \"one verse at a time\"!", "timestamp": 1658160866, "digest": "XMRNWkDpv4OohOeXZqxImG6s8Y_C_Cj4nTLmvucyg_c", "contributor": "0x29f76D7236A16b02D245d477304DDFEaF5989e1A"}

{"id": "M_D0QPWGC_bFDV3yKSUSn4YWBjvQaAuRUH3bfsTrP1s", "title": "#2 Les bases et les premières initiatives", "body": "Hello tout le monde,\n\nLes choses bougent très vite dans le web3 et il est intéressant de faire un état des lieux des solutions en place et à venir.\n\nIl faut bien rappeler que nous sommes au tout début d’un changement majeur, avant l’adoption de masse de cette technologie.\n\nAlors faisons, de nouveau, un point sur certains principes de bases.\n\n## Qu'est-ce qu'un NFT musical ?\n\nUn NFT musical est en général, la vente d’un fichier source (wav, mp3) en tant que jeton unique, avec, dans le cadre d’une sortie de titre, un nombre limité de token (NFT).\n\n## Qu'obtenez-vous avec un NFT musical ?\n\nEn créant son titre en NFT, l'artiste donne la propriété de son contenu et une fois que vous en êtes l’heureux propriétaire, vous pouvez soit conserver ou revendre le NFT. (si ce dernier prend de la valeur par exemple, comme avec une œuvre d’art).\n\nVous n’obtenez pas les droits d’auteur du contenu, sauf que certains artistes commencent déjà à intégrer une notion de \"redevances\" attachée au NFT. (vous touchez un % des ventes du streaming du titre)\n\nExemple avec la dernière sortie du rappeur **Nas** sur le site **[Royal](https://royal.io/editions/Nas-Rare)**\n\nLe NFT peut aussi inclure des tickets de concert, du merchandising ou un accès à un réseau de communication privé (l'accès à un **Discord** par exemple**)**.\n\nL'acquisition du NFT permet donc, en plus de supporter un artiste que vous aimez, de faire partie intégrante du projet, en ayant même un intéressement.\n\n**Ce que ça change par rapport au modèle actuel (Streaming) ?**\n\nComparé au modèle de **Spotify**, selon lequel une chanson vaut ce que les royalties disent qu'elle vaut, c'est l'artiste qui définit ses propres conditions et les auditeurs qui valorisent directement le prix du NFT.\n\n—-\n\nMaintenant ces quelques règles évoquées, faisons un tour des solutions en cours de développement, spécialement dédiées musique.\n\n**Ps :** Dans cette liste, je ne citerais pas les market place types Opensea, Rarible, Mintable etc qui intègrent des NFTS musicaux, mais qui ne sont pas dédiés aux NFT musicaux.\n\n## Pour la création\n\n**[Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/)** est une des premières plateformes de création de NFT musicaux 1/1. Les musiciens peuvent diffuser leurs chansons en tant que NFT 1/1 directement auprès des collectionneurs. Encore en beta et non ouvert à tous.\n\n**[Sound](https://www.sound.xyz/)** permet, de créer des NFT musicaux et permet de créer des opportunités d'engagement exclusives. Non ouvert à tous.\n\n**[Zora](https://zora.co/)** n'est pas exclusif aux NFTs de musique, mais en embarque beaucoup. Non ouvert à tous.\n\n**[MintSongs](https://www.mintsongs.com/)** permet de vendre ses titres en NFT. Solution encore en beta, mais ouverte à tous.\n\n**[Async Art](https://async.art/music?tags=notable)** est une plateforme de création de NFT d’art, mais aussi de NFT musicaux.\n\n**[Royal](https://royal.io/)** lancé par l’artiste **3Lau**, un des premiers artistes à avoir sorti des NFT musicaux. Sa plateforme est encore en beta et s’adresse pour le moment aux très gros artistes.\n\n## DAO de musiciens\n\n« Le terme DAO signifie “decentralized autonomous organization” (organisation autonome décentralisée en français) et peut être décrit comme un protocole blockchain open-source régi par un ensemble de règles, créées par ses membres élus, qui exécutent automatiquement certaines actions sans avoir besoin d’intermédiaires.\n\nLes règles de la DAO sont intégrées dans un code informatique (Smart Contract), qui s’exécute de lui-même en fonction du comportement du protocole. Il n’est pas nécessaire d’interpréter ces règles de programme, car elles sont automatiquement mises en œuvre lorsque les conditions spécifiées se produisent. »\n\nLes DAO sont donc des écosystèmes au sein de la blockchain ou un musicien peut donc monnayer ses NFTs de musique dans une trésorerie DAO et décentraliser la propriété de son contenu parmi sa communauté via des NFTs et des jetons sociaux.\n\n**[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)** permet aux musiciens de créer des DAO pour leur projet d’artiste, de sortie d’album, d’EP ou de single, etc. \n\n**[Juicybox](https://juicebox.money/#/)** est une autre solution opensource qui permet de monter votre DAO..\n\n## Communautés\n\n**[Songcamp band](https://discord.com/invite/wHsJD2sTpc)**, est la première DAO crypto x music.

{"id": "TGStusLbzfQq2WNeSxDLtD4nklRITPJ1FKA-Dts3fsc", "title": "What Are Gamefied NFTs & Why Do They Matter In The Metaverse?", "body": "**Introduction to the \"meta:verses”**\n\nThe Metaverse according to me are interactive & immersive extensions of the Internet, that will be defined & differentiated by the \"game:fied\" mechanisms behind them. I prefer to call it meta:verses as I believe that, just like the \"websites of the internet\", \"galaxies/planets of the universe\", the metaverse is going to be based on 'verses' that will have different functions/mechanisms & use cases.\n\nGamefied NFTs: AKA “Artistic Arcade Metaverses”, a concept derived/coined by me as an indie game dev & an amateur generative artist which involves \"crafting imaginary AI play into art pieces blended with interactive arcade inspired by classic retros or hyper-casual games that will be built & hosted alongside dynamic mechanisms on the blockchain\" & just like single pages of the web, these are simple/single or non-fungible verses of the metaverse.\n\nAs the NFT community evolves: we see different forms of creations, scaling from 1/1 arts to PFPs, from music NFTs to photography & a lot more; but the concept of having NFTs as games might seem new but will be understandable by a lot of people if exposed & will help create a fun filled community as challenges could be created by individuals or teams as I call it; a league of \"non-fungible gamers\" & unlike casual NFTs, these will be multiple editions based or ERC1155 because they are meant to be played by 'people'.\n\nThe concept of gamefied NFTs is both exclusive & inclusive, as all games are hosted on multiple servers like IPFS or itch.io, and these will provide links alongside these crafts that makes it shareable by exclusive owners to non-owners to make it inclusive unlike other NFTs. With these, a lot of indie game devs will be able to hop into the NFT scene as a whole new community of creatives, presently we see a lot of passionate indie game devs running down the drain or struggling to be recognized, as they are not given actual opportunities to expose their cranky creations because big game studios are dominating the scene, but with decentralization & the rise of gamefied NFTs, they'd be able to create exclusive games for the community & with that keep the passion alive. And these way game lovers who would like to play or replay some of these classics are given an opportunity.\n\nIn the blockchain: These could also be used as a medium of token creation, using the $ASH ecosystem & mechanism as an example which Pak tagged \"a token of creation through destruction\" where art pieces released under the ecosystem can be directly burned & used to create new tokens which are directly distributed to the owners/burners as a reward unlike the actual burning system across blockchains. This I site as the second phase of my crafts that I tagged \"Gamefied Fungibility & Interoperability\" this is the part where all gamefied NFTs are merged & can be achieved by either creating an AI blockchain protocol or actual AI blockchain that will power these creations; For (1) Fungibility: Just like $ASH, thousands/millions of gamefied NFTs built by creative devs will be directly burned by owners after playing, as a decentralized means of mining new fungible/social tokens & in return acts as a reward for playing, more like a little 'Play2Earn' games. This will be valued & dynamically balanced by the AI system & by the community using it. This will also serve as a medium of ‘burning’ NFTs & earn an arcade game as a reward… For (2) Interoperability: With an AI system that has the ability to communicate with multi-chains, interoperable transactions will be carried out with a little fee, moving NFTs from one chain to the other will be made easy and will also trigger the minting of new gamefied NFTs to the wallet of the person who carries out this transaction.\n\nIn the actual immersive metaverse: gamefied NFTs will become gem-like collectible mini-games, having read/watched things like \"ready player one\" where we see many mini games coming into play as a form of quest or just a fun play & some actually involving the authors of the OASIS, we could state an example to say to access a certain weapon you must complete this mini game,\n\nor just function as a sort of collectible to boast of like pokemon cards but played in a 2d virtual screen built within these 3d immersive worlds. We could have thousands of it placed across different part of \"meta:verses\" as actual arcade machines but will be more artistic as against the \"retro times\" where coins were inserted to play but here crypto(s) will be inserted to access these.\n\n“The metaverse” just like I stated earlier wouldn't be just immersive worlds, as we are already seeing mechanisms that will be super important in the metaverse, why others are waiting for a single immersive 3D MMORPG as a metaverse, the mechanisms are being put into play, like Pak's \"merge/mass\" this I believe is an actual metaverse of mechanism that is \"play/game\" based. Then the metaverse/meta:verses will be gradually scaled to virtual worlds of fantasies, stories, or just fun based immersive extensions of the internet.\n\nLet's build the metaverse bit by bit: \"one verse at a time\"!", "timestamp": 1658160786, "digest": "Ke_S1-_NCiZEr8-7SrPOh3BhxpFFPIoPFNNJ2jIJiqg", "contributor": "0x29f76D7236A16b02D245d477304DDFEaF5989e1A"}

Nonetheless, let’s examine the reasons: (1) ain’t nobody got time for that. (2) any attempt at a complete explanation would be riddled with assumptions and inaccuracies. Nobody has observed every moment in spacetime, nor possesses the memory to remember, nor the processing capability to completely understand these events. The main point here is that there is a *reason for being* (not to be confused with purpose). The reason that ‘you’ exist is because your dad’s sperm fertilized your mom’s egg. Somewhere along the way, ‘you’ came into existence. However, the answer to the question “Why did you fall off your bike?” requires an infinitely precise answer in order to be 100% accurate (we obviously do not care about 100% accuracy in all cases, nor is 100% accuracy attainable). This is what we will explore in this post.\n\n### Elements of the Mind\n\nOkay, we do not care about The Big Bang when examining your current position in life. Instead, let’s view the most important part of reality -- your lifetime -- because everyone is the hero of their own story.\n\nLet’s begin at the moment in which “you” obtain consciousness\\* (ironically, a moment that nobody can remember). Upon accessing reality for the first time, “you” are immediately introduced to the **cause and effect protocol** of the universe, become aware of “your” existence (‘consciousness’), as well as develop an awareness of ‘thoughts’ and a procedure of thoughts (‘thinking’), achieve (some level of) control of your body and thinking (agency), and eventually learn from the environment (‘intelligence’, ‘cognition’, or as I like to say, ‘an ability to connect the dots’). In this case, the dots are bits of observed data (‘information’) interpreted as truth (‘knowledge’), which we store in our ‘memory’. The connections are a model that describes a functional i/o relation between bits (‘understanding’). Putting this all together, “we” exist as a conscious, intelligent agent of reality perceiving a sequence of moments (‘experience’) which we call life. It is almost as if reality is a Turing-Complete system (a BIG assumption) and our brains are a Turing Machine (another BIG assumption). The one thing missing in the Turing analogy is our ‘imagination’ -- the power to “see the unseen”. The reason that imagination is missing is because it is inconsistent with a Turing Machine, and thus makes humans extra interesting. The brain (our “interpretation engine”) is unique and not well understood. We are also skipping the sub-conscious element of this model for now … but will definitely discuss it later.\n\n### Trapped In The Present\n\nThe reason that we care about history is because we can learn things that may help us in the future. We start to learn the code of reality from personal observations. Then, we learn to communicate with others, trade ideas and inspiration with them, and trust their experiences and historical accounts of reality\\*\\**.* After all, we physically cannot observe *everything* ourselves. Your first conscious moment is different from my first moment, and our experiences may never overlap in any meaningful way (disregarding butterfly effects for now). We cannot recount the past with 100% certainty, especially events that we did not personally observe (and even when we do have an experience … our memory can still be fuzzy). In other words, you should keep the grain of salt in your lens. There are also complex mechanisms that influence our perception (such as assumptions, cognitive bias, motivation, feelings, emotions, and biology) of which we may not be aware in the moment (not to mention the physical limitations of our human senses). Perspective is gained with an account of bias. The famous motto from The Royal Society is pertinent here -- *Nullius in Verba* -- “take nobody’s word for it”.\n\n![A crude example of well-intentioned (perhaps) yet biased hearsay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dSC4WSKaPSXEgp5J1L9A.png?height=1945&width=2085)\n\nA historical account is more reputable when there is evidence to corroborate it’s truth. The most influential evidence garners mass consensus of its implication (a flawed mechanism for finding truth … though it does provide a clue). There is a well known saying “wisdom of the crowd”. There is also a lesser known but equally as important saying “fatality of the mob”. Consensus provides a signal on social dynamics more than anything. The objective of consensus is to win a majority, which is all about compromise\\*\\*\\*, not truth-seeking. There is another common phrase, “history is written by the winners”, which is not an entirely true statement in its literal translation but is an attempt to describe the common biases in historical accounting. The history textbooks are missing many individual accounts, particularly on the loser’s side. This is not all the publisher’s fault because there are typically less of the losers around after a significant historical event like war, but the missing context makes the book sensitive to a combination of conformity, misattribution, and survivorship bias.\n\n![Infinitism  -- The Ultimate Burden Of Proof -- aka The Absence of Evidence vs. Evidence of Absence Fallacy](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd070309s.gif)\n\nEvidence is built through discovery -- a gain of information which improves our understanding of the circumstances which produced the evidence. It is still up to humans to deduce valid conclusions from discoveries. We commonly mistake evidence as proof. Circumstantial evidence does not have the power to prove on its own. Rather, it can indicate the likelihood of a particular events’ existence, but not accurately until we drop it into context. A proper investigation entails observing each instance of history and each piece of evidence as independent from each other (and from that moment of history … not viewed as a “Bayesian” from the future) and then imagining the logical sequence of events to form dependencies, hence the phrase “drawing a conclusion”. Every piece of evidence or historical account has a level of faith associated with it (and we usually realize overconfidence). For example, the discovery of fossils indicates the existence of large, now-extinct beings. And we can even imagine what they looked like! However, the fossils and present-day graphical renderings do not prove dinosaurs’ existence. The evidence simply gives us a level of confidence. A different explanation for the existence of fossils could be that a scientist synthesized fossil materials in a lab and buried them to eventually claim fame once he/she later “discovers” them and proposes a breakthrough theory of dinosaurs. However, there are sound reasons that easily disprove this explanation, namely, there is no evidence of a scientist or lab in 1677 (when Robert Plot found the first fossil) that had the capability to synthesize an organic material that could resemble the form of a fossil.\n\n![The Gettier Problem (philosophy), Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems (math), and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (science) all arrive at the same idea from different disciplines -- proof requires complete information and infinite precision. Conjecture is imminent (we settle for \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" in court.)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/proof.png)\n\nEvidence is an empirical starting point. It exists in context. A thorough assessment of evidence addresses as much context as possible. At the same time, there will always be missing context, so we will never have a totally complete or perfectly accurate history. I call this *The* *Theory of Relative History*.\n\n### Explanations\n\nI once concluded that everything can be explained, so the world must be deterministic. I arrived at this conclusion after reading *[The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359)* by David Deutsch. I highly recommend reading it. In fact, it was the inspiration for this blog (if you don’t read books, then at least listen to Naval Ravikant’s *[The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0)* podcast series with Brett Hall breaking down the book). The big takeaway from the book is that omniscience is not required to have ‘creativity’ -- an ability to create new “things”. You do not need to know absolutely every fact that exists in order to understand everything that can be understood. Reality is most accurately described using good explanations, and there is an explanation for everything. The building blocks of explanations are **[First Principles](https://fs.blog/first-principles/#_ftn11)** -- namely the foundations of science (Relativity, Quantum, Evolution, Information, Computing, etc.) -- and the fuel is imagination.\n\n> *“What I cannot create, I do not understand”*\n>\n> \\-- Richard Feynman\n\nScience is an error-correcting machine. It disproves explanations and forms better ones. You will find that the most impactful explanations require intense imagination because they describe the *Unseen*:\n\n(1.) things that do not exist in the present moment and are of the past or future. For example, we can imagine hypotheticals.\n\n(2.) things which are not apparent to the senses, thus not observable. For example, we can measure the temperature of an atom’s nucleus, but we cannot observe the movement of quarks which are the cause (we think) of the temperature reading that we observe. Unobservable phenomena can be measured with special equipment, but we just observe the measurement readings on the equipment.\n\nAn explanation is not an explanation unless it is testable, falsifiable, and precisely answers “How?”. An explanation is our best guess. In this way, even good explanations are at risk of being inaccurate. This is okay because this is how we create new knowledge. A good explanation is our best understanding, our best description for how something works, why something happened, or why something will happen, at any given time. It is like the scientific method on steroids. A good explanation provides reasons and digs deep. It asks questions to get to the root. Try the **5 Why’s method** to improve the accuracy of an explanation.\n\n> *“Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.”*\n>\n> — Carl Sagan\n\nAs you can see from the bike example at the beginning, an explanation does not need to be entirely complete in order to be valuable because intelligent beings (humans) can identify patterns and make inferences. Again, a partially true, incomplete explanation can be sufficient if we only care about a certain level of accuracy. An explanation is measured by its explanatory power -- the degree to which an explanation accomplishes an objective. The objective can be (and usually is) to accurately describe or predict reality. Explanations have degrees of completeness based on the amount of information present in them\\*\\*\\*\\*. A thorough explanation leaves little to chance. A complete explanation leaves nothing to chance. The pinnacle of explanations is a perfect explanation -- 100% complete and 100% accurate. The ultimate explanation, a *Theory of Everything*, would be perfect. Many people have tried to find this explanation, such as Michio Kaku's *[The God Equation](https://www.amazon.com/God-Equation-Quest-Theory-Everything/dp/0385542747)* (I have not read yet), but none have succeeded.\n\nThe jury is still out on if a perfect explanation exists.\n\n### Truth\n\nOur initial guess for how knowledge exists is known as the ‘justified true belief’ theory of knowledge. This theory says that knowledge is about justifying your beliefs as true. It then goes on to say that if you accomplish this, then your belief is Truth (with a capital ‘T’). This a misconception because there is no logical way to prove any bit of knowledge as Truth (see [epistemic regress](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/knowledge/infinite_regress.html)). One can provide evidence, but this is not proof. If an explanation prevails against attempts to disprove it, then it is consistent with Truth and is probably considered useful. Yet, we can never know with 100% certainty that the explanation accurately describes a fundamental Truth (a “law” of nature\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*) because there is always a chance that we discover new information debunking that explanation. Then, we simply come up with a better explanation.\n\nThe first step to finding truth is to develop a theory of knowledge (epistemology). I subscribe to the theory that knowledge is an interpretation of information that is accepted as truth and can be measured for accuracy and significance. This implies knowledge is subjective i.e. your truth may not be my truth.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xwFu_2fyTN7kfq6Mi8bBH.png?height=792&width=1561)\n\nIn the end, knowledge is simply an iterative assumption. Humans seek highly objective knowledge because we get rewarded with better predictions. Nassim Taleb describes a concept of *non-observables*, in his *[Incerto](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Deluxe-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/198481981X)* (my favorite is *[The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Impact-Improbable-Incerto/dp/1400063515/ref=asc_df_1400063515/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312106851030&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11165397501409576070&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010943&hvtargid=pla-330161967766&psc=1)*). There will always be unknowns and we do not know the significance of the unknowns. The highly significant non-observables are The Black Swans. We don't know for sure what will effect us, kill us, or save us. It may not be real today.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kWP9k4Mb0aJLmmm6JXgSD.png?height=697&width=1114)\n\nExplanations can retrospectively describe causation and also make reasonable predictions → which builds information and iterates knowledge → which inspires imagination → which creates explanations. These ‘creations’ bring a truth into existence that did not exist before (or at least did not exist to ‘you’). It is quite liberating when you realize that explanations are created with imagination, so in theory, you can understand anything! Regardless of whether or not information is infinite\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, knowledge is not scarce. It is the product of intelligence and unbounded imagination and is stored in memory.\n\nKeep in mind, reality is unbiased. It is Truth. It just is\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is the purest form of objectivity (no interpretation necessary). Frankly, reality does not care about you (or anything). Reality is left to humans for interpretation. The most useful application of this realization is to practice acceptance because the world is not out to get you. At the same time, we are an agent of change capable of effecting our own lives. For every effect, there is a cause\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. For every output, there is an input. You may notice the continuity of this universal model. But what happens when there is a discontinuity in the model? And what does a gap represent?\n\n### Randomness\n\nThe answer is randomness -- uncertainty attributed to an absence of information. This is where we can assign probabilities rather than determinations of the future. The important thing here is that reality is not intrinsically random or uncertain … with one theoretical exception. The only proposed natural randomness in the universe is the phenomena described by quantum mechanics -- an explanation for how matter and energy behaves as spacetime approaches zero. Even in quantum, we have some predictive ability of the probability distribution of subatomic particles in spacetime. This gets more interesting if you consider quantum randomness in a multiplicative series of moments. As you can see, each sequential moment gets increasingly difficult to predict and eventually the complexity explodes, leading most scientists to chaos theory and the multiverse\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*.\n\nAll other probability is subject to a knowledge base. This means that any likelihood which we attributed to an event’s existence is a function of our ignorance. When humans say “I am uncertain”, we are admitting that we do not know a critical piece of information that would make the Truth apparent. We can reduce uncertainty and increase the accuracy of our predictions by reducing knowledge gaps (not to be confused with information gaps). Here are two ways to reduce knowledge gaps and improve predictability:\n\n1\\.) empirical methods -- inducing a hypothesis from experience.\n\n2\\.) explanatory methods -- deducing a cause and effect relation from imagination.\n\nThese methods are most powerful when deployed in tandem.\n\nEmpirical methods infer an independent factor (causal inference) from observations or experimental results (statistics). This is useful to identify information gaps. You can gain (uncover) information by changing the conditions (i.e. varying the independent variable to see the change in the dependent variable). Here’s a hint, when correlations between events approach 100%, you may getting closer to a causal relationship (though there still may be ‘Hidden’ variables\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* which are the actual root cause). However, correlation is not causation\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* …. so … how do you know if the measured response in the ‘effect variable’ was the result of varying the ‘cause variable’ or if the independent factors are truly independent themselves? Enter explanations.\n\nThis is how explanatory methods save the day. Explanations describe ‘the seen’ in terms of ‘the unseen’ -- information not represented in the statistics -- and can implicate an unknown factor as the root cause. The reasoning offered in an explanation is based in ‘possibility’ as opposed to ‘probability’ (though probability can also appear in an incomplete explanation). When something is deemed ‘unexplainable’, this indicates either a severe information gap or a lapse in imagination.\n\nI suggest watching Vsauce's YouTube video: \"[What is Random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0)\" and Veritasium’s sister episode: \"[What is Not Random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE)\" to further explore randomness as a property of ignorance.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE)\n\nTo quickly make better predictions, acquire fundamental knowledge. Search for the fundamental factors of reality, the ones with high explanatory power. Lean on *First Principles* thinking or even better -- [Zeroth-Principles Thinking](https://medium.com/future-literacy/zeroth-principles-thinking-9376d0b7e7f5). After all, explanations are the best way to hunt the Truth. On the other hand, we will always have to make decisions with incomplete information, and thus are exposed to uncertainty … so get used to it!\n\nI glossed over the fact that “meaning” is an important part of the brain’s interpretation engine. Sooo … what is meaning? Is meaning created or intrinsic to reality? If we assume that reality is deterministic, then can meaning exist or can we have free will? Can there be a meaning of life? If we assume that life has meaning, then what is the meaning? My best answer right now: the meaning of life is to create value. More on that in the next post…\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*I assume ownership of consciousness for the sake of understanding; rather, consciousness spontaneously “exists” without an agent or precise initial moment and is “you”. I enjoyed Brett Hall’s view of [ontology](https://www.bretthall.org/blog) --an explanation of being--what does it mean to exist. The model that I describe requires a definition for the concept of “you” (a whole exercise itself). I use a version of “you” that is a figment of the brain and represents an identity. “You” is awareness that exists as a state of consciousness. I also enjoyed Evan Conrad’s [article](https://evanjconrad.com/posts/how-to-feel-good) which offers a view that “you” are not your “thoughts” and suggests practical applications of this knowledge. “You” observe thoughts. At the same time, you have agency of thinking in the sense that you may be aware of a thought or feelings and its relation to “you” (as an identity that has control of an interpretation engine which does thinking procedures and serves the next thought). I would like to add that you are not your feelings. In Conrad’s view, both thoughts and feelings are real “to” you, rather than “are” or “of” you.\n\n\\*\\*Yes, trust in fellow humans is risky, but the payoffs have historically outweighed the costs. There are concepts of infinite games in Game Theory which incentivize cooperation in most instances.\n\n\\*\\*\\*We will explore the mechanisms of consensus in another post.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*Completeness is a function of access and precision. Explanations are incomplete when they are missing info. This is almost always the case when expressing explanations in spoken language because language itself is imprecise. A good question: can we know all information?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* When describing physical reality, there is no such thing as a “law of nature” or Truth (with a capital ‘T’) since the description exists in the abstract realm of knowledge. There are just REALLY good explanations (called theories in science) that may resemble physical Truth because of their accuracy in describing and predicting phenomena, but we would never know for certain. However, there is a Truth. It exists and exists as reality. This implies the existence of False (with a capital ‘F’). Knowledge is abstract thought -- an interpretation of information which exists relative to reality (Truth/False) -- and can actually be True or False when describing knowledge, but not reality.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*The more important and deeper question is whether reality is continuous or discrete. This question is most famously illustrated via [Zeno’s Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes). Modern science does not even have a consensus on this answer. I think the answer requires a better understanding of time and information. Is information a property of reality? Does reality exist as a state of information at (that changes changes between?) moments of time? Can we create new “things” (real or abstract)? Does the set of information (as elements) grow, accumulate, remain static, or simply change?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*I suppose the ultimate truth is whether reality itself exists or not.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*We may explore whether the inverse is necessarily true, which requires a consideration of infinity. What happens when you consider time (the temporal relationship between cause and effect)? The most convincing concept of time that I can understand is that time represents a relation between moments of reality. In this concept, a moment is a state of information (reality) and time is the relation of moments -- The God Equation -- rather than the moment. Therefore, there are instances of information, rather than instances of time. Time describes change. It *is* change. If time is a relation mapping a state of info to another state of info, which [type](https://t-redactyl.io/blog/2021/03/types-of-functions-injective-surjective-and-bijective.html) of relation is it?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*We may address these concepts at some point. We perceive time as a sequence of moments (maybe a series when considering our memory), but time may not actually “be” an ordered sequence of moments. We do not have access to all of reality (information), which leads to gaps in information and knowledge (understanding). Also, knowledge lags information. The Truth Spectrum is not to be confused with true vs. false in logic. It is more closely related to the concept of [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) in Information Theory.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Any statistical model can attempt to predict reality. Some models are capable of making accurate predictions (though maybe not significant). Yet, any model trying to predict reality assumes a complete and closed system. We can use a model to make inferences about things not in the data, but non-observables belong to the realm of possibility (unknown unknowns), not probability (known unknowns). A change in the dependent variable (effect) may be caused by an unaccounted or unknown factor (cause) rather than the independent factor. This may be “confounding'“ to some. Others say Hidden variables, once identified in an experiment, are “extraneous” if they think they can be controlled. It is hard to control variables (especially unknown ones) in experiments, and physical experiments are temporal in nature.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Correlation is an association between sets, not a function. Causality is a function of sorts.\n\nPS: I promise future blogs will not be this long.", "timestamp": 1658161577, "digest": "MBShaUZiXxaQ3Da512suqM6nTAL4hD7OyPPakdoRzKg", "contributor": "0x8FA9E69BA39A209e6D105c6ccfd82e7c2c5Af28f"}

Une seule invention est c’est la révolution industrielle.” - Lip dans la série culte [Shameless ](https://www.allocine.fr/series/ficheserie_gen_cserie=7634.html)👈 😀\n\nLe modèle en place est-il juste ?\n\nEt si une oeuvre digitale pouvait être unique ?\n\nAvoir, de nouveau, une valeur !\n\nVotre dernier single, doit-il forcément valoir 0,0033ct€ par écoute ?\n\n#### Un modèle centré sur l’artiste et le fan\n\nCe changement a déjà commencé avec l’arrivée de plateformes alternatives comme **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/)** ou **Kickstarter**.\n\nLe fan est impliqué à un niveau plus important dans le projet de l’artiste et reçoit des contre-parties en échange d’un financement participatif.\n\n**Et avec les NFTs, la relation artiste/fan va encore plus loin.**\n\nEn achetant un NFT, ils achètent un actif de l’artiste, qui peut prendre de la valeur (pour l’artiste\\* et pour le fan) ; le succès devient dès lors, **relationnel**.\n\n\\*chaque NFT comprend généralement une part du créateur - un pourcentage qui revient à l'artiste chaque fois que le NFT est revendu - lui permettant de gagner de l'argent pour toujours.\n\nLa blockchain se charge de valider et d’automatiser ces transactions, éliminant ainsi, certains intermédiaires et les problématiques de \"mauvais contrats\" ou de \"fausses promesses\".\n\n#### Une réglementation qui ne suit pas encore\n\nAvant que les NFTs n'entrent dans la danse, la propriété de la musique était déjà complexe : chaque enregistrement sonore est protégé par de multiples droits d'auteur, et chaque utilisation distincte :\n\n* Jouer une chanson\n* En faire une copie\n* La diffuser\n* La jouer en synchronisation avec un contenu visuel\n\nIl faut maintenant ajouter à cela le cadre de “ténu de la propriété numérique”, car la propriété juridique d'un fichier numérique n'existe pas à ce jour.\n\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nApporter le web3 dans l’industrie musicale, c’est voir les artistes reprendre le pouvoir sur leur art, sur leurs flux de revenus avec la possibilité de les partager avec leurs consommateurs/fans s’ils le souhaitent.\n\nC’est aussi voir les fans devenir des fans **actifs**.\n\nDepuis juin 2020, plus de 1,6 million de NFT musicaux ont été vendus, générant un chiffre d'affaires d'environ 100 millions de dollars.\n\nLe changement est donc déjà en marche, mais la route est encore longue pour que les acteurs majeurs de cette industrie acceptent de revoir ce qui leur paraissaient comme acquis.\n\n\n---\n\n### Si tu es cool avec l’anglais, voici quelques lectures :\n\n* **[Revuto](https://nftnewstoday.com/2022/07/09/revuto-launches-10000-revulution-nfts-unlocking-spotify-or-netflix-for-life/)**[ lance la souscription Netflix & Spotify à vie, en NFTs](https://nftnewstoday.com/2022/07/09/revuto-launches-10000-revulution-nfts-unlocking-spotify-or-netflix-for-life/)\n* **[Timbaland](https://www.nftnewsmania.com/timbaland-presents-congo-nft-nft-culture-nfts-crypto-art/)**[ présente Congo NFTs](https://www.nftnewsmania.com/timbaland-presents-congo-nft-nft-culture-nfts-crypto-art/)\n* [Le collectif ](https://www.billboard.com/pro/camp-chaos-songcamp-nfts-50-person-band/)**[Songcamp](https://www.billboard.com/pro/camp-chaos-songcamp-nfts-50-person-band/)**[ mis en avant sur ](https://www.billboard.com/pro/camp-chaos-songcamp-nfts-50-person-band/)**[Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/pro/camp-chaos-songcamp-nfts-50-person-band/)**\n* [Les réflexions d’Annika Rose après avoir participé au NFT NYC](https://twitter.com/AnnikaRoseSings/status/1542600877034307586?s=20&t=Bvgja3oagsnXvvuDon2kVA)\n* [Pharell Williams devient le ](https://www.complex.com/music/pharrell-named-chief-brand-officer-doodles-nft?utm_campaign=musictw&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social)**[Chief Brand Officer du projet NFT Doodles](https://www.complex.com/music/pharrell-named-chief-brand-officer-doodles-nft?utm_campaign=musictw&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social)**\n\n\n---\n\n### Liens utiles\n\n* [Le lexique du Web3 par ](https://nft-mania.io/2021/08/le-grand-lexique-des-nft/)**[NFT Mania](https://nft-mania.io/2021/08/le-grand-lexique-des-nft/)**[ & ](https://nft-mania.io/2021/08/le-grand-lexique-des-nft/)**[NFT francophone](https://nft-mania.io/2021/08/le-grand-lexique-des-nft/)**\n* **[Spinamp](https://app.spinamp.xyz/listen)**[, un des tous premiers players de NFTs](https://app.spinamp.xyz/listen)\n* **[Side.events :](https://side.events/)**[ Annuaire des événements Web3 autour de toi](https://side.events/)\n* **[Gamestop](https://nft.gamestop.com/)**[, nouveau market place qui a le vent en poupe](https://nft.gamestop.com/)", "timestamp": 1658161636, "digest": "U72InJRPjzubsKgXumtvl0RzWpw3e0wOeHDqQcX5ZHw", "contributor": "0xaF1Ae141054B323f031841495B5e6Ae0cbA4D9D6"}

{"id": "3gfksSOm6c-_4iIeQgW5PGRIylktMK-ipKRK0atx7yg", "title": "Mips (MIPS.ST) Analysis", "body": "*I’m not a professional and I’m not recommending anything. Just sharing my thoughts.*\n\n**General:**\n\nMips is a company specializing on brainprotection for helmets. The company is world leading and started its research phase at 1996, had their first prototype ready 2000. Year 2015, over 1 million helmets had the mips technology implemented and 2017 they got listed on Nasdaq.\n\nThe technique purpose is to reduce rotational forces to the head and brain during impact by reducing friction between head and helmet. This is reducing the risk of brain tissue stretching that would normally lead to brain damages during impact. Mips got around 300 patents and the components production is outsourced to another company in Shenzhen, China (90%). This is associated with risk, but pretty much all helmet producer share the same geographical risk since most helmets are produced in this region. The helmets are easy to recognize in the stores, they all have a yellow sticker and the salesmans are well aware of the benefits of using this kind of helmet.\n\nMips have a total adressable market of 410 million helmets, with their newly entered market, safetyhelmets consists of 310 million helmets. The focus market as of know consists of 130 million helmets of wich they still only have a 10% market share!\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ddc8d32-b912-4fa3-aa31-053e4115e2e8_808x828.png)\n\n**Business model:**\n\nMips businessmodel is built on royalties from other helmet manifacturers. The helmets are in a price range with a minimum price of 150 SEK ($15) into 3 different segments, bycicle, sport and safety (industrial and law enforcement) helmets. It’s a cheap insurance that everyone should be having and I believe that if they would need to increase the prices, the company would not feel any negative effects from that. Those who already uses helmets will continue to do so regardless and in the other segments, motorcycle, riding, teamsport or industry there are laws forcing users to have helmets.\n\nRecently Mips have benefited from law changes in 2020 when a test-standard for motorcycle helmet producers came through from Federacion indernationale motorcyclisme. The tests forces producers to do tests on rotational forces on impact. There have been discussions about implementing similar standards in other sports and practices too, but we will have to wait more for that.\n\nBike helmets have always been the main business. The safety helmets is a new segment that got added 2019 and still haven’t had a big success. The reason seems to be the long process to get a contract with bigger manufacturers. However, in april 2022 they announced a collaboration with Uvex who is one of the biggest producers globally for safety equipment (revenues of €534M during fiscal year 20/21). How this will effect Mips is something we have to wait and see, but recent comments from Mips have been that they want to ramp up and reach bigger volumes in this segments some time during 2022.\n\nIn november they launched a virtual testlab that lets helm designers test their models on a computer before doing it physically. This means that a test-simulation only takes 10 days to complete instead of the previous 50 days. Totally there have been 50 000 tests (according to the news report 2021).\n\nMips have through the years been competitive. Year 2021, 12 million helmets with Mips tech got sold, the year before it was 7,2million. Third-part tests have been done. Mips bike helmets are considerably better than the competitors, in the top 10, 9 of the helmets using Mips. Top 10 in snowboarding have 5.\n\nFull list: <https://helmet.beam.vt.edu/bicycle-helmet-ratings.html>\n\nThere are a few competitors but they are small and limited. They promise more than they can provide as of know. Last time I heard about a bigger threat was when Trek and Bontragers new helmets 2019 was provided with a newly made material called WaveCel that was supposed to be 48x better than a traditional helmet and 3-12x better than Mips. WaveCels tests was then proved to be insufficient. Hövding is another competitor but they have an airbag solution but it’s not really popular, either it’s because it’s not convenient, the price of 300€ is to much or because people don’t trust that kind of technology yet. It also needs to be charged to use (alot of people seem to have battery problems too), you also need to put it in idle to not activate when not being on the bike. According to insurance company Folksam, it’s not a helmet to trust. 2020 It got a “trusted”-grade by Folksam but have since then been removed (while all Mips helmet tested got a good grade).\n\nCompetition is not on the same lever yet.\n\nAnother competitor entering the research phase is public swedish company Autoliv (7 billion SEK market cap, making safetysystems for cars) together with helmet manufacturer POC to make a helmet with a airbag solution also. However, this one is going to try to apply Mips businessmodel instead of Hövdings and as mentioned is just in the research state.\n\n**Financials**\n\nThe debt of the company is non-existent.  They can really decide to pay of their debts whenever they want. They have a cash account of 98M SEK and total debts of 106M. They are not capital intensive either. The operating cash flow the last 2 years have been 277M SEK (116M SEK) with cash flow in investing staying at low -11M SEK (-15M SEK) that contributes to a strong free cash flow. Top-line CAGR is at 27% between 2016-2021. Gross margins at around 75% and G&A and R&D to sales getting lower and lower for every year. EBIT margin 2021 was at 53% with a net margin of 41%. Q1 2022 have also shown strong sales with a revenue growth of 65%.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd94b6654-34e4-49c4-a79a-b72857120af3_576x246.png)\n\nAlso, notice the ROIC the last years. Worth mentioning that Mips had problems growing during corona mainly due to lack of components at the helmet factories. There is a big order backlog with accounts receivables to sales beeing at 1,24 wich is very high considering that they have been between 0,25 to 0,35 the last 5 years.\n\nAccording to my own calculation, Mips is making around 21 SEK ($2,1) per helmet sold on average (97% of revenue is sales of helmets, 3% is services). With those numbers, the sales could theoretically look something like this (unless the focusmarket is NOT getting bigger, wich it acutally should)\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93a01bbe-a28f-462c-8cdb-41257b1d72db_421x131.png)\n\nRight now they are still scaling up the business at fast pace. Capex very low in comparison to opex. I guess they are at a point soon where they will need the money to either buy a company or share the profits with the shareholders in other ways. Going forward Mips have a goal of 2027 reach revenues of 2B SEK, operating results (EBITDA)-margins at 50% and pay out a dividend of 50% of net income.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nOf course the companies strong financial status and big potential for growth have effected the valuation of the company alot. Market cap is currently at 12 Billion SEK with a P/E of 47. Even though there have been a massive fall of 60% from the top. Based on Mips own goals of 2 billion in revenues and my belief that they will keep a net margin of 40%. This would mean a 800M SEK bottomline. A P/E at 12-15 would give is a market capo f between 9,6B – 12B SEK. Wich is a stock price of 362 SEK to 452 SEK year 2027. However, I am optimistic that they will be able to reach revenues greater than that and also to be valued at levels higher than what I expect, but with that a bigger market share, merger&acquisitions and new markets and sacrificing short term earnings would be needed.\n\n**Catalyst**\n\n> -          Scaling up safety segment (industry/law enforcement)\n>\n> \\-          Bigger market share of focus area\n>\n> \\-          Merger & acqusition", "timestamp": 1658162361, "digest": "JnBoyrKlAAJiSNcDBj2QgIpDihoX6lE2J3UVC8uM-7U", "contributor": "0x1C0930289E78209b84eb886C90882E1bF42faa38"}

Just sharing my thoughts.*\n\n## **General:**\n\nWinner of danish e-commerce award 2022 for companies with revenues below 100M DKK. Freetrailers business is lending trailers and now more recently e-bikes (with big baskets for goods transportation) in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Germany through an app to unlock a bluetooth lock either for free or very cheap. Their model is to rent their service to a partner that have access to a big parking, Freetrailers put the other companies logo on the trailer (that way the other company can market themselves) and is also doing the maintenance of all the trailers. The contracts are usually around 3-4 years. They are also making money from the consumers using the trailers, but more of that later.\n\nAlof of big companies are currently using Freetrailers services, IKEA is a long-term customer. Others worth mentioning is ICA (biggest grocery store in Sweden), COOP (2nd biggest grocery chain), Elgiganten (popular technology store), REMA 1000 (big grocery store in Norway+Denmark), Europris (biggest grocery store in Norway. Alot of other big hardware/bulding material stores such as Byggmax, Beijer, Woody, and XL Bygg are also connected. Having Freetrailer have become a way to attract customers. However, the users of the trailer DO NOT need to shop at the retailer where they are renting the trailer.\n\nThe utilization rate for the trailers is up to 89% (Denmark 90%, Sweden 97%, Norway 69% and Germany 20%). However, the utilization rate is calculated by number of bookings divided by days (you rent the trailer until the store opens the next day, most people do give it back much earlier though). What I can see myself in the app, they are less popular during the working days, but every trailer is used several times a day in the weekends, this is what is boosting the number.\n\n**The app:**\n\nThe app have over 100 000 downloads on Google play with 10 000 reviews and an average score of 4.8 out of 5 stars. There is a big flow of positive comments, the few ones that are giving 1 star is due to technical issues (such as the trailer not opening for different reasons). Those commenters are being contacted by freetrailers support. The app made keeping track of unused trailers easier and have also made is possible for people to lend it when the store is closed.\n\n\\*\\*Consumers: \\*\\* The biggest share of the revenue comes from the consumers (70%), partners account for 20% and other is 10%.

Just sharing my thoughts.*\n\n## **General:**\n\nWinner of danish e-commerce award 2022 for companies with revenues below 100M DKK. Freetrailers business is lending trailers and now more recently e-bikes (with big baskets for goods transportation) in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Germany through an app to unlock a bluetooth lock either for free or very cheap. Their model is to rent their service to a partner that have access to a big parking, Freetrailers put the other companies logo on the trailer (that way the other company can market themselves) and is also doing the maintenance of all the trailers. The contracts are usually around 3-4 years. They are also making money from the consumers using the trailers, but more of that later.\n\nAlof of big companies are currently using Freetrailers services, IKEA is a long-term customer. Others worth mentioning is ICA (biggest grocery store in Sweden), COOP (2nd biggest grocery chain), Elgiganten (popular technology store), REMA 1000 (big grocery store in Norway+Denmark), Europris (biggest grocery store in Norway. Alot of other big hardware/bulding material stores such as Byggmax, Beijer, Woody, and XL Bygg are also connected. Having Freetrailer have become a way to attract customers. However, the users of the trailer DO NOT need to shop at the retailer where they are renting the trailer.\n\nThe utilization rate for the trailers is up to 89% (Denmark 90%, Sweden 97%, Norway 69% and Germany 20%). However, the utilization rate is calculated by number of bookings divided by days (you rent the trailer until the store opens the next day, most people do give it back much earlier though). What I can see myself in the app, they are less popular during the working days, but every trailer is used several times a day in the weekends, this is what is boosting the number.\n\n**The app:**\n\nThe app have over 100 000 downloads on Google play with 10 000 reviews and an average score of 4.8 out of 5 stars. There is a big flow of positive comments, the few ones that are giving 1 star is due to technical issues (such as the trailer not opening for different reasons). Those commenters are being contacted by freetrailers support. The app made keeping track of unused trailers easier and have also made is possible for people to lend it when the store is closed.\n\n\\*\\*Consumers: \\*\\* The biggest share of the revenue comes from the consumers (70%), partners account for 20% and other is 10%. You don’t actually need to pay for using the trailer, but on the weekend, they are so popular that making the reservation fee of 29SEK and with (49SEK) or without (0SEK)  insurance is worth it (without insurance you will have to pay somewhere between 150SEK (broken or lost adapter) to 4500 SEK (stolen trailer) based on damage/delayed return etc. Like I mentioned before, it’s possible to lend the trailer until before the store opens the next day.

With a hypnotic timbre, Mark Zuckerberg tells a story about the world to come that says everything there will be just as it is here. Just as our room is now, so it will be in the world to come; where our baby sleeps now, there too it will sleep in the other world. And the clothes we wear in this world, those too we will wear there. Everything will be as it is now, just differently textured.\n\nThe familiarity of variable-poly surfaces, however, belies the novel forms of visuality that animate the metaverse. Beneath the illusory layer of avatars and environments, techniques such as subtle gaze direction exploit research on human visual cognition and attention, while computer vision algorithms are refined by data synthesized using computer graphics. For humans, these new images operate below the threshold of perception; for machines, they provide the foundation of perception. Machine learning models trained on synthetic data, which is diverse and perfectly labeled by design, generalize better than models trained on real data, enabling avatars to represent users in granular detail. The development of immersive technologies constitutes its own form of vision.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z0PeTXBZUBO9hyIKVK9T3.jpeg?height=883&width=1365&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&)\n\nSMPLverse NFTs use facial recognition to retrieve [data synthesized by Microsoft to train face tracking algorithms for its mixed reality headsets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.15102.pdf). Like many pfp projects, the Microsoft dataset uses procedural generation to randomly create and render faces without any manual intervention. The images combine a generative 3D face model with a library of artist-created assets—including textures, hair, and clothing—and SMPL, a body mesh used to animate avatars in virtual environments. Though the synthetic images are indifferent to human vision, they tempt an overidentification: their verisimilitude is formally irrelevant to machine learning, yet it remains the only method of achieving functional equivalence with real data.\n\nAfter minting, you receive a token with which you can submit an image through a webcam interface. Your submitted image is written to the token as a hash and matched to the next-closest smpl using a facial recognition model. Whereas the matched image mimics the form of your identity, the hash stored in the token preserves its content, although indecipherably (the image is hashed using a one-way compression function). When the image is matched, it receives one attribute: confidence. Confidence assesses the likelihood that your image matches the smpl you receive. Confidence is a declining measure: as more smpls are matched, your likelihood of receiving a high confidence match decreases.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ua2pugKf_c16nk4xt8MhA.png?height=512&width=1024&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&)\n\nVisually, the training images suggest identity play, emulating the avatars whose naturalism they are meant to enhance. Their effect, however, is to attune algorithms ever more precisely to users’ physical selves: the dataset expresses how users appear to virtual environments as much as how they appear in them. The minting process elaborates this tension between individual agency and computational constraint, voluntarism and determinism. Even a pool of 100,000 images is too small to consistently produce high confidence matches.\n\nUnlike the elective avatars that crowd the metaverse’s surface, SMPLverse NFTs are avatars for the metaverse’s infrastructure. Beyond digital culture’s native identity paradigm—[whereby identity is constructed and maintained strategically, as if from a third person perspective](https://gilbert.mirror.xyz/T_tVYHzaibzJ36fdkrBz-lF0hAcuL8l9F5bswPeO4lg)—SMPLverse maps the nonhuman identities conceived by machine learning. Though the secondary market may stage the traumatic return of the elective avatar repressed by the user’s biometric identity, it cannot mask the fact that the synthetic images are themselves proxies for seeing machines, which exceed and overcome the human binary of pseudonymity and identity.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/65U1_J5nnhymnckIKe9lu.jpeg?height=288&width=249)\n\nSMPLverse can be minted at [smplverse.xyz](https://smplverse.xyz/).

{"id": "DBVwUfKieaeUz07veqlz8laRaXZJQ5N501EZaIlx75k", "title": "What's a 'Good' Explanation?", "body": "## Look at your surroundings.\n\nNow, explain how you ended up here.\n\nDid your answer include the creation of existence, such as The Big Bang? If not, your answer is incomplete.\n\n### Existence\n\nDon’t be hard on yourself. Your explanation did not need to be 100% complete to suffice. This prompt is typically interpreted as a request for the most immediate and significant reasons for being here, such as: “I fell off my bike and broke my arm, so now I am in the ER”. For obvious reasons, it is impractical to describe The Big Bang and then every sequential moment that led to you falling off your bike. Nonetheless, let’s examine the reasons: (1) ain’t nobody got time for that. (2) any attempt at a complete explanation would be riddled with assumptions and inaccuracies. Nobody has observed every moment in spacetime, nor possesses the memory to remember, nor the processing capability to completely understand these events. The main point here is that there is a *reason for being* (not to be confused with purpose). The reason that ‘you’ exist is because your dad’s sperm fertilized your mom’s egg. Somewhere along the way, ‘you’ came into existence. However, the answer to the question “Why did you fall off your bike?” requires an infinitely precise answer in order to be 100% accurate (we obviously do not care about 100% accuracy in all cases, nor is 100% accuracy attainable). This is what we will explore in this post.\n\n### Elements of the Mind\n\nOkay, we do not care about The Big Bang when examining your current position in life. Instead, let’s view the most important part of reality -- your lifetime -- because everyone is the hero of their own story.\n\nLet’s begin at the moment in which “you” obtain consciousness\\* (ironically, a moment that nobody can remember). Upon accessing reality for the first time, “you” are immediately introduced to the **cause and effect protocol** of the universe, become aware of “your” existence (‘consciousness’), as well as develop an awareness of ‘thoughts’ and a procedure of thoughts (‘thinking’), achieve (some level of) control of your body and thinking (agency), and eventually learn from the environment (‘intelligence’, ‘cognition’, or as I like to say, ‘an ability to connect the dots’). In this case, the dots are bits of observed data (‘information’) interpreted as truth (‘knowledge’), which we store in our ‘memory’. The connections are a model that describes a functional i/o relation between bits (‘understanding’). Putting this all together, “we” exist as a conscious, intelligent agent of reality perceiving a sequence of moments (‘experience’) which we call life. It is almost as if reality is a Turing-Complete system (a BIG assumption) and our brains are a Turing Machine (another BIG assumption). The one thing missing in the Turing analogy is our ‘imagination’ -- the power to “see the unseen”. The reason that imagination is missing is because it is inconsistent with a Turing Machine, and thus makes humans extra interesting. The brain (our “interpretation engine”) is unique and not well understood. We are also skipping the sub-conscious element of this model for now … but will definitely discuss it later.\n\n### Trapped In The Present\n\nThe reason that we care about history is because we can learn things that may help us in the future. We start to learn the code of reality from personal observations. Then, we learn to communicate with others, trade ideas and inspiration with them, and trust their experiences and historical accounts of reality\\*\\**.* After all, we physically cannot observe *everything* ourselves. Your first conscious moment is different from my first moment, and our experiences may never overlap in any meaningful way (disregarding butterfly effects for now). We cannot recount the past with 100% certainty, especially events that we did not personally observe (and even when we do have an experience … our memory can still be fuzzy). In other words, you should keep the grain of salt in your lens. There are also complex mechanisms that influence our perception (such as assumptions, cognitive bias, motivation, feelings, emotions, and biology) of which we may not be aware in the moment (not to mention the physical limitations of our human senses). Perspective is gained with an account of bias. The famous motto from The Royal Society is pertinent here -- *Nullius in Verba* -- “take nobody’s word for it”.\n\n![A crude example of well-intentioned (perhaps) yet biased hearsay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dSC4WSKaPSXEgp5J1L9A.png?height=1945&width=2085)\n\nA historical account is more reputable when there is evidence to corroborate it’s truth. The most influential evidence garners mass consensus of its implication (a flawed mechanism for finding truth … though it does provide a clue). There is a well known saying “wisdom of the crowd”. There is also a lesser known but equally as important saying “fatality of the mob”. Consensus provides a signal on social dynamics more than anything. The objective of consensus is to win a majority, which is all about compromise\\*\\*\\*, not truth-seeking. There is another common phrase, “history is written by the winners”, which is not an entirely true statement in its literal translation but is an attempt to describe the common biases in historical accounting. The history textbooks are missing many individual accounts, particularly on the loser’s side. This is not all the publisher’s fault because there are typically less of the losers around after a significant historical event like war, but the missing context makes the book sensitive to a combination of conformity, misattribution, and survivorship bias.\n\n![Infinitism  -- The Ultimate Burden Of Proof -- aka The Absence of Evidence vs. Evidence of Absence Fallacy](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd070309s.gif)\n\nEvidence is built through discovery -- a gain of information which improves our understanding of the circumstances which produced the evidence. It is still up to humans to deduce valid conclusions from discoveries. We commonly mistake evidence as proof. Circumstantial evidence does not have the power to prove on its own. Rather, it can indicate the likelihood of a particular events’ existence, but not accurately until we drop it into context. A proper investigation entails observing each piece of evidence from that instance of history (not as a “Bayesian” viewing that moment of history from the future) and then imagining the logical sequence of events (and eventually using the power of hindsight) to form dependencies, hence the phrase “drawing a conclusion”. Every historical account has a level of faith associated with it (and we usually realize overconfidence). For example, the discovery of fossils indicates the existence of large, now-extinct beings. And we can even imagine what they looked like! However, the fossils and present-day graphical renderings do not prove dinosaurs’ existence. The evidence simply gives us a level of confidence. A different explanation for the existence of fossils could be that a scientist synthesized fossil materials in a lab and buried them to eventually claim fame once he/she later “discovers” them and proposes a breakthrough theory of dinosaurs. However, there are sound reasons that easily disprove this explanation, namely, there is no evidence of a scientist or lab in 1677 (when Robert Plot found the first fossil) that had the capability to synthesize an organic material that could resemble the form of a fossil.\n\n![The Gettier Problem (philosophy), Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems (math), and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (science) all arrive at the same idea from different disciplines -- proof requires complete information and infinite precision. Conjecture is imminent (we settle for \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" in court.)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/proof.png)\n\nEvidence is an empirical starting point. It exists in context. A thorough assessment of evidence addresses as much context as possible to understand its implication. At the same time, there will always be missing context, so we will never have a totally complete or perfectly accurate history. I call this *The* *Theory of Relative History*.\n\n### Explanations\n\nI once concluded that everything can be explained, so the world must be deterministic. I arrived at this conclusion after reading *[The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359)* by David Deutsch. I highly recommend reading it. In fact, it was the inspiration for this blog (if you don’t read books, then at least listen to Naval Ravikant’s *[The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0)* podcast series with Brett Hall breaking down the book). The big takeaway from the book is that omniscience is not required to have ‘creativity’ -- an ability to create new “things”. You do not need to know absolutely every fact that exists in order to understand everything that can be understood. Reality is most accurately described using good explanations, and there is an explanation for everything. The building blocks of explanations are **[First Principles](https://fs.blog/first-principles/#_ftn11)** -- namely the foundations of science (Relativity, Quantum, Evolution, Information, Computing, etc.) -- and the fuel is imagination.\n\n> *“What I cannot create, I do not understand”*\n>\n> \\-- Richard Feynman\n\nScience is an error-correcting machine. It disproves explanations and forms better ones. You will find that the most impactful explanations require intense imagination because they describe the *Unseen*:\n\n(1.) things that do not exist in the present moment and are of the past or future. For example, we can imagine hypotheticals.\n\n(2.) things which are not apparent to the senses, thus not observable. For example, we can measure the temperature of an atom’s nucleus, but we cannot observe the movement of quarks which are the cause (we think) of the temperature reading that we observe. Unobservable phenomena can be measured with special equipment, but we just observe the measurement readings on the equipment.\n\nAn explanation is not an explanation unless it is testable, falsifiable, and precisely answers “How?”. An explanation is our best guess. In this way, even good explanations are at risk of being inaccurate. This is okay because this is how we create new knowledge. A good explanation is our best understanding, our best description for how something works, why something happened, or why something will happen, at any given time. It is like the scientific method on steroids. A good explanation provides reasons and digs deep. It asks questions to get to the root. Try the **5 Why’s method** to improve the accuracy of an explanation.\n\n> *“Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.”*\n>\n> — Carl Sagan\n\nAs you can see from the bike example at the beginning, an explanation does not need to be entirely complete in order to be valuable because intelligent beings (humans) can identify patterns and make inferences. Again, a partially true, incomplete explanation can be sufficient if we only care about a certain level of accuracy. An explanation is measured by its explanatory power -- the degree to which an explanation accomplishes an objective. The objective can be (and usually is) to accurately describe or predict reality. Explanations have degrees of completeness based on the amount of information present in them\\*\\*\\*\\*. A thorough explanation leaves little to chance. A complete explanation leaves nothing to chance. The pinnacle of explanations is a perfect explanation -- 100% complete and 100% accurate. The ultimate explanation, a *Theory of Everything*, would be perfect. Many people have tried to find this explanation, such as Michio Kaku's *[The God Equation](https://www.amazon.com/God-Equation-Quest-Theory-Everything/dp/0385542747)* (I have not read yet), but none have succeeded.\n\nThe jury is still out on if a perfect explanation exists.\n\n### Truth\n\nOur initial guess for how knowledge exists is known as the ‘justified true belief’ theory of knowledge. This theory says that knowledge is about justifying your beliefs as true. It then goes on to say that if you accomplish this, then your belief is Truth (with a capital ‘T’). This a misconception because there is no logical way to prove any bit of knowledge as Truth (see [epistemic regress](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/knowledge/infinite_regress.html)). One can provide evidence, but this is not proof. If an explanation prevails against attempts to disprove it, then it is consistent with Truth and is probably considered useful. Yet, we can never know with 100% certainty that the explanation accurately describes a fundamental Truth (a “law” of nature\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*) because there is always a chance that we discover new information debunking that explanation. Then, we simply come up with a better explanation.\n\nThe first step to finding truth is to develop a theory of knowledge (epistemology). I subscribe to the theory that knowledge is an interpretation of information that is accepted as truth and can be measured for accuracy and significance. This implies knowledge is subjective i.e. your truth may not be my truth.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xwFu_2fyTN7kfq6Mi8bBH.png?height=792&width=1561)\n\nIn the end, knowledge is simply an iterative assumption. Humans seek highly objective knowledge because we get rewarded with better predictions. Nassim Taleb describes a concept of *non-observables*, in his *[Incerto](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Deluxe-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/198481981X)* (my favorite is *[The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Impact-Improbable-Incerto/dp/1400063515/ref=asc_df_1400063515/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312106851030&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11165397501409576070&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010943&hvtargid=pla-330161967766&psc=1)*). There will always be unknowns and we do not know the significance of the unknowns. The highly significant non-observables are The Black Swans. We don't know for sure what will effect us, kill us, or save us. It may not be real today.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kWP9k4Mb0aJLmmm6JXgSD.png?height=697&width=1114)\n\nExplanations can retrospectively describe causation and also make reasonable predictions → which builds information and iterates knowledge → which inspires imagination → which creates explanations. These ‘creations’ bring a truth into existence that did not exist before (or at least did not exist to ‘you’). It is quite liberating when you realize that explanations are created with imagination, so in theory, you can understand anything! Regardless of whether or not information is infinite\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, knowledge is not scarce. It is the product of intelligence and unbounded imagination and is stored in memory.\n\nKeep in mind, reality is unbiased. It is Truth. It just is\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is the purest form of objectivity (no interpretation necessary). Frankly, reality does not care about you (or anything). Reality is left to humans for interpretation. The most useful application of this realization is to practice acceptance because the world is not out to get you. At the same time, we are an agent of change capable of effecting our own lives. For every effect, there is a cause\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. For every output, there is an input. You may notice the continuity of this universal model. But what happens when there is a discontinuity in the model? And what does a gap represent?\n\n### Randomness\n\nThe answer is randomness -- uncertainty attributed to an absence of information. This is where we can assign probabilities rather than determinations of the future. The important thing here is that reality is not intrinsically random or uncertain … with one theoretical exception. The only proposed natural randomness in the universe is the phenomena described by quantum mechanics -- an explanation for how matter and energy behaves as spacetime approaches zero. Even in quantum, we have some predictive ability of the probability distribution of subatomic particles in spacetime. This gets more interesting if you consider quantum randomness in a multiplicative series of moments. As you can see, each sequential moment gets increasingly difficult to predict and eventually the complexity explodes, leading most scientists to chaos theory and the multiverse\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*.\n\nAll other probability is subject to a knowledge base. This means that any likelihood which we attributed to an event’s existence is a function of our ignorance. When humans say “I am uncertain”, we are admitting that we do not know a critical piece of information that would make the Truth apparent. We can reduce uncertainty and increase the accuracy of our predictions by reducing knowledge gaps (not to be confused with information gaps). Here are two ways to reduce knowledge gaps and improve predictability:\n\n1\\.) empirical methods -- inducing a hypothesis from experience.\n\n2\\.) explanatory methods -- deducing a cause and effect relation from imagination.\n\nThese methods are most powerful when deployed in tandem.\n\nEmpirical methods infer an independent factor (causal inference) from observations or experimental results (statistics). This is useful to identify information gaps. You can gain (uncover) information by changing the conditions (i.e. varying the independent variable to see the change in the dependent variable). Here’s a hint, when correlations between events approach 100%, you may getting closer to a causal relationship (though there still may be ‘Hidden’ variables\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* which are the actual root cause). However, correlation is not causation\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* …. so … how do you know if the measured response in the ‘effect variable’ was the result of varying the ‘cause variable’ or if the independent factors are truly independent themselves? Enter explanations.\n\nThis is how explanatory methods save the day. Explanations describe ‘the seen’ in terms of ‘the unseen’ -- information not represented in the statistics -- and can implicate an unknown factor as the root cause. The reasoning offered in an explanation is based in ‘possibility’ as opposed to ‘probability’ (though probability can also appear in an incomplete explanation). When something is deemed ‘unexplainable’, this indicates either a severe information gap or a lapse in imagination.\n\nI suggest watching Vsauce's YouTube video: \"[What is Random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0)\" and Veritasium’s sister episode: \"[What is Not Random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE)\" to further explore randomness as a property of ignorance.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE)\n\nTo quickly make better predictions, acquire fundamental knowledge. Search for the fundamental factors of reality, the ones with high explanatory power. Lean on *First Principles* thinking or even better -- [Zeroth-Principles Thinking](https://medium.com/future-literacy/zeroth-principles-thinking-9376d0b7e7f5). After all, explanations are the best way to hunt the Truth. On the other hand, we will always have to make decisions with incomplete information, and thus are exposed to uncertainty … so get used to it!\n\nI glossed over the fact that “meaning” is an important part of the brain’s interpretation engine. Sooo … what is meaning? Is meaning created or intrinsic to reality? If we assume that reality is deterministic, then can meaning exist or can we have free will? Can there be a meaning of life? If we assume that life has meaning, then what is the meaning? My best answer right now: the meaning of life is to create value. More on that in the next post…\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*I assume ownership of consciousness for the sake of understanding; rather, consciousness spontaneously “exists” without an agent or precise initial moment and is “you”. I enjoyed Brett Hall’s view of [ontology](https://www.bretthall.org/blog) --an explanation of being--what does it mean to exist. The model that I describe requires a definition for the concept of “you” (a whole exercise itself). I use a version of “you” that is a figment of the brain and represents an identity. “You” is awareness that exists as a state of consciousness. I also enjoyed Evan Conrad’s [article](https://evanjconrad.com/posts/how-to-feel-good) which offers a view that “you” are not your “thoughts” and suggests practical applications of this knowledge. “You” observe thoughts. At the same time, you have agency of thinking in the sense that you may be aware of a thought or feelings and its relation to “you” (as an identity that has control of an interpretation engine which does thinking procedures and serves the next thought). I would like to add that you are not your feelings. In Conrad’s view, both thoughts and feelings are real “to” you, rather than “are” or “of” you.\n\n\\*\\*Yes, trust in fellow humans is risky, but the payoffs have historically outweighed the costs. There are concepts of infinite games in Game Theory which incentivize cooperation in most instances.\n\n\\*\\*\\*We will explore the mechanisms of consensus in another post.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*Completeness is a function of access and precision. Explanations are incomplete when they are missing info. This is almost always the case when expressing explanations in spoken language because language itself is imprecise. A good question: can we know all information?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* When describing physical reality, there is no such thing as a “law of nature” or Truth (with a capital ‘T’) since the description exists in the abstract realm of knowledge. There are just REALLY good explanations (called theories in science) that may resemble physical Truth because of their accuracy in describing and predicting phenomena, but we would never know for certain. However, there is a Truth. It exists and exists as reality. This implies the existence of False (with a capital ‘F’). Knowledge is abstract thought -- an interpretation of information which exists relative to reality (Truth/False) -- and can actually be True or False when describing knowledge, but not reality.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*The more important and deeper question is whether reality is continuous or discrete. This question is most famously illustrated via [Zeno’s Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes). Modern science does not even have a consensus on this answer. I think the answer requires a better understanding of time and information. Is information a property of reality? Does reality exist as a state of information at (that changes changes between?) moments of time? Can we create new “things” (real or abstract)? Does the set of information (as elements) grow, accumulate, remain static, or simply change?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*I suppose the ultimate truth is whether reality itself exists or not.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*We may explore whether the inverse is necessarily true, which requires a consideration of infinity. What happens when you consider time (the temporal relationship between cause and effect)? The most convincing concept of time that I can understand is that time represents a relation between moments of reality. In this concept, a moment is a state of information (reality) and time is the relation of moments -- The God Equation -- rather than the moment. Therefore, there are instances of information, rather than instances of time. Time describes change. It *is* change. If time is a relation mapping a state of info to another state of info, which [type](https://t-redactyl.io/blog/2021/03/types-of-functions-injective-surjective-and-bijective.html) of relation is it?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*We may address these concepts at some point. We perceive time as a sequence of moments (maybe a series when considering our memory), but time may not actually “be” an ordered sequence of moments. We do not have access to all of reality (information), which leads to gaps in information and knowledge (understanding). Also, knowledge lags information. The Truth Spectrum is not to be confused with true vs. false in logic. It is more closely related to the concept of [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) in Information Theory.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Any statistical model can attempt to predict reality. Some models are capable of making accurate predictions (though maybe not significant). Yet, any model trying to predict reality assumes a complete and closed system. We can use a model to make inferences about things not in the data, but non-observables belong to the realm of possibility (unknown unknowns), not probability (known unknowns). A change in the dependent variable (effect) may be caused by an unaccounted or unknown factor (cause) rather than the independent factor. This may be “confounding'“ to some. Others say Hidden variables, once identified in an experiment, are “extraneous” if they think they can be controlled. It is hard to control variables (especially unknown ones) in experiments, and physical experiments are temporal in nature.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Correlation is an association between sets, not a function. Causality is a function of sorts.\n\nPS: I promise future blogs will not be this long.", "timestamp": 1658163527, "digest": "XBF7e-KI2SNCYCGSqRaK059TbHOrbIfgP2crB0wfjmA", "contributor": "0x8FA9E69BA39A209e6D105c6ccfd82e7c2c5Af28f"}

{"id": "DSfRFLK9JEle7r5ZHCaaFP7jemw7w-7qdkuCz1dwKH8", "title": "One of the 20%", "body": "Yesterday morning, I was bright-eyed bushy-tailed; and prepared with a list of topics that I wanted to discuss for my weekly 1:1 with my manager. As I hopped on and landed on the waiting screen, I saw my manager and Devin on the call. I knew something was up but I joined with a smile. My smile immediately fell flat within seconds as I saw the distressed look on Devin’s face. I knew he was going to deliver some hard news to me and he did.\n\n[I became one of the 20% who was let go.](https://fortune.com/2022/07/14/opensea-nft-marketplace-layoff-crypto-winter/)  After the news, I was utterly dumbfounded and numbed, but I took the news lightly as I understood they had to do what was important for the business and the state of the market.  An hour later, I received the most thoughtful message from Alex and I burst into extreme tears; and memories of my time at OpenSea flashed before my eyes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BLhihGLpO3r03LC6Km3lS.png?height=381&width=505)\n\nWaves of emotions filled my mind and my heart — from feeling appreciated, confused, sorrowful, angry, yet a bit relieved.\n\nMy journey at OpenSea is rooted quite deep and started with a hackathon back in February 2018. Alex, Devin, Dylan, Elena and a few others started a project called [Ethmoji](https://ethmoji.io/), where you can build your own Ethmoji and customize your own eyes, nose, mouth, and hair. The special thing about this project is that all the owners of each attribute used in the composition can earn royalties. This was the birth of PFP collections.\n\nAfter this hackathon, Alex and Devin invited me to join OpenSea to build an eBay for digital assets as their founding designer. I declined as I was cautious of early-stage startups after being the founding designer at Zugata (acq by [Culture Amp](https://www.cultureamp.com/)). Also, I was really skeptical about the space and didn’t quite understand why people were buying and [selling digital cats](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) online.\n\n![Counter-clockwise: Jessica Phan, Alex Atallah, Devin Finzer, Dylan Field, and Elena Nadolinski. Photo taken by my beloved husband who has always supported every project.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5MkwMsGW7xq8gdOBVHfRx.jpg?height=960&width=720)\n\nHowever, marketplaces are my bread and butter and I’ve always loved working with Alex, so I decided to work part-time with OpenSea. At the same time, I was off on my own venture — [traveling the world](http://jessica.is/a-hodophile/), consulting with other companies, while building my very own called [Hathorway](https://hathorway.com/).\n\nIn the Fall of 2020, Devin asked if I would be interested in joining full-time and leading Product and Design at OpenSea. It was such an exciting opportunity and a big role, but I had declined once again because I just created a new company with a friend after becoming a new mother, called [Ritual Meals](https://ritualmeals.com/) and I wanted to see this through.\n\nOnce 2021 rolled in, NFTs started blowing up and OpenSea raised their Series A of $23m, everything changed. And I realized the food industry is a cut-throat business, I left Ritual Meals and placed all my bets on OpenSea. Once I joined, I partnered really closely with [Nate Chastain](https://twitter.com/natechastain), who is one of my favorite people to work with despite the [insider trading fiasco](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-employee-nft-marketplace-charged-first-ever-digital-asset-insider-trading-scheme). Together, we cranked and cranked features along with many talented engineers, and watched the bars in volume rise month to month.\n\nDuring my time here, I had many first. I was the first 10 employees, the first designer, the first woman, and the first mother. I  designed the first several versions of [OpenSea.io](https://opensea.io/), [the blog](https://opensea.io/blog), [the logo](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/56143034414220578210570473379568418089845102446433003880655728973961440002049), [the first mobile app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKt59kExL-o),  [the first OpenSea and NFT explainer video](https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1446492795066372099) with [Thinkmojo](https://www.thinkmojo.com/), coined the phrase “the world's first and largest NFT marketplace”, and built out a killer design team, healthy design culture, and well-oiled process that I am proud of.\n\nYesterday was the end of this journey for me. In a way, it felt as if I have carried and given birth to a child, only to have it taken away from me. But I realized that OpenSea is not a child anymore, it has grown up and left the house. And it’s time for me to let go and move on.\n\nFor the other 20% that were laid off, thank you for putting so much heart and soul into what you do — for building OpenSea for what it is today and laying out the foundations of the NFT space from the product, community, and team. Wipe those tears, brush any discouragement and doubts, and be so proud of what we’ve accomplished together.\n\nFor those who remain at OpenSea, my only ask is “don’t fuck it up” — for the sake of those that fall in 20%.  I know you will do an amazing job evolving it, so take good care with OpenSea. LFG.\n\nAnd yes, once again, [jessica is unemployed](http://jessica.is/unemployed/). While I’m still deciding what my next venture will be, I will be taking a little break — perhaps [make some jewelry](https://hathorway.com/), [draw a little](http://jessica.is/animal-letters/), [write a little](https://www.fastcompany.com/3055836/how-feng-shui-could-help-build-better-products), and finally, be able to be present with family.\n\nIf you like to connect, you can reach me via twitter [@ohjphan](https://twitter.com/ohjphan)", "timestamp": 1658165884, "digest": "3EMlnj-jRPeOt_GpScJqKoa0OQDnRafVrLjCOj6O6vc", "contributor": "0x7c1fD4d5aCc15b46729c5Fb9279B49Cf71178654"}

Scratch that…! I have always been a skeptic. This is because I find myself constantly weighing up my options in terms of logical premises, and lets be honest, sometimes, you just have to go with your gut! But even so, when I began surveying the basic principles that govern this new model of the internet aka “web3”, I found myself at loggerheads once more battling between the emotional highs of what others are doing, and what makes more sense!\n\nRight now, there’s a plethora of information being posited into every available market and it can become quite overwhelming. So many people in the web3 space often DM me asking me how many NFT’s I own (and we will get to this momentarily), and the majority of those conversations revolve around NFTs, -as in NFT art- yet this minuscule piece isn’t about Punks or BAYC (Yup, Shoot me! I’m behaving like a like an NFT heretic).\n\n### Of NFTs & NFT Domains\n\nWhilst NFT art is definitely the conduit that created a real buzz around the world, most people within the space are completely oblivious to the fact that **NFT art is merely one block in an endless chain of possibilities with regards to non-fungible tokens**. Coming back to the common question that most NFT art holders lean with, it usually commences by the question, “*So? How many NFT’s do you own?”* and my response is, “*Over 1000*”. This is usually met with a request of images as proof, or followed by the question of “*Which collection?*” \n\nHowever, what majority of these inquisitors fail to realize is that **every domain from *Unstoppable Domains i*s an NFT** and the use-cases from ‘owning’ them are far too enticing to pass up that opportunity. \n\nThink about it…right now, even though you may be accessing this NFT article from a web2 browser, in time to come, there will be web3 decentralized sites set up that will give the member direct access, and as a corollary, phasing out the web2 sites. And in that inevitable case, it is not NFT art, or metaverse land that will become the most sought after commodity of web3, but NFT domains, without which, web3 will remain a pipe dream, because inasmuch as it will be constantly referred to, without NFT domains, the websites will still be web2-based, and that is a reality that web3 idealists will not support in the long term.\n\nIt is therefore, a highly sound deduction that NFT domains will ‘direct’ the keyboards of every web3 enthusiast in time to come just as how .coms, .orgs etc. were the craze when the legacy internet was being set up. Those who have understood this, and have been piling up on the NFT domains will, in all probability -like their predecessors- come out as the overall winners in the space. \n\nHowever, there are some challenges when making the correct choice, and this is where my personal experience guided me, to what I believe, will be the next top CNS (crypto naming service) for web3., viz. *Unstoppable Domains*.\n\n### The Tipping Points\n\nWhen I first got into the space (mind you only in November 2021), I had engaged in an exhaustive deep dive juxtaposing the pros and cons and then revisiting some of the legacy domain policies. I was just swallowing up information like a vacuum cleaner on steroids.. And by the end of this feeding frenzy, my decision was based on the following *tipping points* that simply nudged me in the correct direction. They were;\n\na) Ownership\n\nb) Cost\n\nc) Immediate Utility\n\n### To Own or Not to Own, This is the Question?\n\nThe web3 space is all about the ‘*ownership economy*’ and it is indeed the fundamentally attractive point for both investors and the general populace. However, during my research into the web3 naming services, I found myself at a cul-de-sac of confusion as many of these naming services were still modelled on the previous web2 modus operandi regarding custodianship.\n\n For instance, *ENS Domains* is excelling in secondary sales, which is undoubtedly an attractive point when choosing where to invest, and a reason that causes one to become emotional when deciding, but the question of whether they are absolutely immutable in terms of ‘ownership’ is a matter of great debate because like the legacy root before, domains are held in the custody of the registrar, and as a result, the owner risks loss of the domain by means of expiration date or failure to pay renewal fees. By this measure, ENS Domains did not meet the criteria -according to my understanding of the ‘ownership economy’-, and was a vital reason why I did not opt to invest in large amounts of .eth domains. \n\n*Unstoppable Domains* on the other hand, presented a more web3-ish option as the domains are stored in the custody of the purchaser to the point that even if UD wanted the domain back, they would require action from the purchaser to transfer it into their custody. The reason why this particular aspect was a tipping point in the direction of Unstoppable Domains was simply because, if I could not take custody of the NFT domain as my digital asset in my own wallet under my rules, then technically I never owned it at all, and if I never owned it at all, then it pretty much felt like a web2 version with some web3 face painting, and that was something that did not sit well with me. \n\nNow I am certain that the ENS maxis out there will disagree, and they are entitled to their opinions, but until I can be convinced of true ownership, knowing that if I went into a sudden coma, and awoke 10 years later, that my domain would not have been snatched away from me as a corollary of not being in my full custody, then that is a product I am not 100% sure of its claim to be within the ‘ownership economy’ -in my view anyway.\n\nFor instance, I currently own ‘*whistleblowers.x*’ and in terms of the concept of secrecy and discretion in the very nature of whistleblowing, this can only work if it is decentralized and out of the crutches of those who wish to push their political agendas. Now, if I owned ‘whistleblowers.eth’ and established trust from various whistleblowers out there to freely communicate their information or crypto payments discreetly…and if I missed the renewal date due to some unforeseen circumstance, then I could risk their safety as whistleblowers to disastrous effect. Thus, true ownership in this ‘domain’ is the factor that tipped me straight into the warm embrace of UD are they give me autonomy over the domain, and that my dear friends, is how I envisage web3. Don’t you?\n\n### Costing\n\nAgain, I found myself at loggerheads when ENS Domains kept coming up in my searches, and I was quite impressed that ENS does not have any price structure that causes you to spend hundreds of thousands on a domain. This is a bonus on anybody’s radar. What I did not know was that gas fees could be much more than the domain itself at times, and those who were much more experienced had been utilizing specialized tools to determine the best possible times when gas fees were low. I, on the other hand did not have that luxury, and found it a stumbling block that in addition to the initial gas fees, at every renewal process, I would be required to pay for gas. Some may argue that the gas fee issue is mitigated by purchasing the domain for 5 years as an example, but if I want to flip domains for quick cash then this option isn’t ideal at all. Sure, it may suit those who have deep pockets, or those looking to HODL for the long term, but even then, if you hold 300 domains and each one requires renewal, there is a high probability of missing out on some of them -and .com users know all too well about that. \n\nWith *Unstoppable Domains*, there is a once-off fee. You can get a domain for as little at $5 as a random pseudonymous wallet address, of even something like *jedigamer123.nft* for $5 (still available by the way) and never have to concern yourself with renewal fees, or expiration of the domain…ever! Once it is secured by your crypto wallet, you are the official ‘owner’ of that NFT domain. \n\nThe average price of the .nft is approximately $20, the .crypto around $40 and the .x is $100. The algorithm prices the more premium domains at a much higher rate and can range from anything between $20-$250k or more perhaps. When you are selling something completely, then you can understand the price hike for domains that are of higher demand. For instance, no sane person in the space would expect to pay $20 for ‘business.crypto’ as that is a much sought after key word with endless possibilities. Incidentally, it belonged to @DiaryNoori (someone I can call my friend) and it sold on Opensea for $120k this year. \n\nIn terms of cost, I prefer to pay for something once-off and know that it is mine to own, having never to concern myself thereafter with any kind of pricing that may jeopardize my domain in the case of any unforeseen circumstances or negligence on my part. This is my preference, and for those who are fine with having to continuously check their domains for expiration dates and to budget for that, then ‘to each their own’, even if the incessantly laborious is what tickles your fancy. \n\n### Immediate Utility\n\nInsofar as utility is concerned, we are still relatively early in the web3 space and whilst this is good, it does not mean that there shouldn’t be immediate utility. There are a lot of naming services out there popping up like mushrooms after the rains, but many of them are just charging for domains that cannot be utilized at the base level for buying or selling crypto, let alone a market place to flip them. ENS and Unstoppable Domains are leading the way currently by providing utility in many ways, even at this early stage. The tipping point for me once again was the fact that Unstoppable Domains currently offers 10 extensions instead of one, so I could choose, -based on the name I was purchasing- whether or not a particular extension suited the ideals of that which was envisaged for the domain. For instance, if I wanted to have a domain with view to building an NFT project later on, I just couldn’t see it with a .eth extension that could be self explanatory to anyone who saw the project. So was I to add \\*\\*\\*\\*nft.eth? Or just get a .nft? the latter was always going to make more sense.\n\nAdditionally, Unstoppable Domains prides itself in not just supplying names, but providing use-cases for the domains that will allow the holder’s on-chain identity to travel with them wherever they travel in the world of web3. I will attempt to write a little piece later on regarding the utility of UD’s NFT Domains, but for beginners struggling to make these decisions, I have found the variety at UD to be far more attractive, albeit unlike Handshake, that offers limitless TLDs, Unstoppable Domains has created a culmination of some of the most relevant extensions that are self-explanatory within the space and extensions that will become common lingo!\n\n**Conclusion** - My choice to go all-in on Unstoppable Domains comes from a place that is predicated on logic because so many aspects about their mission  and product just makes sense in retrospect of the web3 vision that we all hope to see some day. Yes, many may assume this material to be biased, but as a holder of ENS domains and Handhsake domains too, my views are based on my experience. I believe that web3 is big enough for everyone to survive and I cannot see a future of web3 that does not include Unstoppable Domains as a leading naming service. With over 2.5 million registrations in the bag and hundreds of partnerships with crypto companies, Unstoppable Domains is going to be a force to be reckoned with, and I am proud to wear the badge of a UDwhale!\n\n**Acknowledgement:** It would be criminal not to mention some of the great people along the way that guided me in my journey to becoming a whale investor, people who I am eternally thankful to, and who are part of the ever growing UDfam…they are (by twitter handle):\n\n@dontgetdashed\n\n@PopDomains\n\n@CaptainBitcoinx\n\n@Ohh_Mr_Silver\n\n@theweb3god\n\n@tipstapunk\n\nThanks Guys!

土地>门票>明信片。\n\n2\\.蓝色紫色橙色入门小地块值得购买，建议想要参与游戏的玩家尽量早入手基础土地，如果是投资的话，建议在二级市场密切关注橙色及以上稀有度的地块。\n\n3\\.门票可以等活动抢一下试试，预计还有 1\\~2 次出售活动， 目前黄金门票已溢价十倍， 银和玉门票价格稳中看涨。\n\n4\\.明信片是限量套装，但是官方没有进一步的消息，价格目前稳定，不建议投资，自用的话可以考虑买入，价格还是比较合理的，有上涨空间，但不如土地和门票实用。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F8mq-GBuRD1Q5HrHbmdHtK.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n##

等公司招募了一支由游戏行业资深人士组成的全明星团队。团队成员曾为众多知名游戏Fortnite、战神、使命召唤和守望先锋等做开发或运营。\n\n《BigTime》的CEO是Ari Meilich，此前为Decentraland的创始人；艺术指导是《魔兽世界》的视觉原画设计Carlo Arellano，首席概念艺术家为《英雄联盟》场景原画概念艺术家Tom Zhao；豪华的游戏开发团队用自研专利的 Vault 技术来搭建游戏内的交易架构。\n\n## 投资团队\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fz1lDYQraPEFGvNzrakplc.png&w=1200&q=90)\n\n去年五月份Big Time Studios获得包括FBG Capital、North Island Ventures、Digital Currency Group、OKEx Blockdream Ventures、Alameda Research、Circle Financial以及Sound Ventures领投的1030万美元在内的2100万美元的A轮融资。另外获得的1100万美元基金将用于投资采用Big

硬核观点\n\n1\\.顶级开发团队与雄厚资金支持，切入的角度与目前市面上大部分游戏多为不同，注重游戏体验、提高公平性，这才是游戏本来该有的样子。\n\n2\\.BigTime将不会有代币私募，游戏不会向任何人（包括开发团队）提供代币的首次发行或预售，代币将100%由社区驱动。可以感受到big time完全不一样的游戏格局，这是我非常看好的一点。\n\n3\\.区别于现在碎片化的游戏（或者说是矿游图片），big time更类似目前传统的游戏，耗时长，需要玩法精，策略多，配合上游戏经济代币模型+多种类NFT，对于玩家有一定门槛，也提高了游戏的耐玩度和激励刺激度。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FThqXHLuD4hQNpHOeu3NGF.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n以上！\n\n\\--------------\n\n用硬核的态度面对不（fei）确（chang）定（c

{"id": "wtBF_pEhSCQFZ-Ig0urk5T9sJl5nm35_ODlFDhgwCQ0", "title": "Presenting the Revert Compoundor", "body": "We’re excited about releasing a new feature today for Uniswap v3 Liquidity Providers: **fee auto-compounding.**\n\nWe think this will be useful for LPs depending on how long they plan to hold positions and what they expect their **Fee APR** to be going forward.\n\nIn Uniswap v3 compounding of fees does not occur automatically, as it does on its predecessor, and manual compounding of fees requires doing a few different contract interactions and calculations to:\n\n1. Collect fees via the Uniswap NFT Manager contract.\n2. Possibly check the amounts of token0 and token1 required to swap so as to maximize the amount of liquidity added to the position.\n3. Possibly perform the required swap.\n4. Add the tokens as liquidity to the position.\n\nAdditionally because fees do not grow at a constant rate, and the cost of compounding is a multiple of the gas price, to compound optimally requires constant monitoring of a position.\n\nBecause gas prices determine the cost of compounding, the deployment of Uniswap v3 on low gas price chains means that a much larger proportion of positions would be optimally compounded a much greater number of times that on mainnet.\n\nTo automate the above process we are releasing a simple protocol: Revert Compoundor.\n\nPositions managed by the Compoundor contract can be auto-compounded by anyone. The ***autoCompound*** function takes any uncollected fees for a position, optionally swaps them to a determined ratio given the position range and the current pool price, and adds it as liquidity to the position.\n\nA small fraction of the *collected-and-compounded* fees are paid to the protocol and to compensate the accounts call the auto-compound function for their gas costs incurred. This performance fee is set to 2% on launch and by design can only be decreased, never increased.\n\nAdditionally once a position is added to the Compoundor protocol contract, the position owner is able to conveniently execute the ***autoCompound*** function at any time, in which case there are no fees charged aside from the regular gas costs of executing the call.\n\nWe are publishing a draft of a [whitepaper](https://hackmd.io/@revert/BJcGIJQ35) that explains how the protocol works and how we are estimating the expected benefits of auto-compounding for any position.\n\nAdditionally the protocol contracts have had an open bug bounty on Immunefi since June 14th.\n\n[https://github.com/revert-finance/compoundor](https://github.com/revert-finance/compoundor)\n\n[https://immunefi.com/bounty/revert/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/revert/)\n\nTo give it a try just visit your positions dashboard, and for any v3 position you will see a “Compound Fees” button at the bottom, by clicking on it a panel will expand that will show you the estimated benefits of auto-compounding your position given the current fee APRs.\n\n![A hypothetical position that would benefit from auto-compounding](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RX4uGBzjUqUTnU-xEDLm1.png?height=1524&width=1098)\n\nThe total yearly improvement, and the time to break-even, will depend on each positions’ performance. Depending on each LPs strategy and expectations, auto-compounding might not be ideal. Particularly on high gas-price environments like Ethereum mainnet, auto-compounding should be attractive mostly to LPs with very high fee apr, or long expected time range on their positions.\n\nWe are also excited about launching this protocol/feature today simultaneously on [Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code), [Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code), [Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code), and [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code).\n\nSo we hope you try it out, check if it makes sense for your current or future Uniswap v3 positions, and if you have any questions or comments, drop by our discord.", "timestamp": 1658167216, "digest": "Uz-aJ5PYYmcCp-d-fJm7d4pVowI0XKKBZF0ZN3LtSKM", "contributor": "0x8cadb20A4811f363Dadb863A190708bEd26245F8"}

CryptoPunks 是第一个 NFT 化身，而Hashmasks引发了最近的炒作。归根结底，Bored Ape Yacht Club 是那些让事情变得更加主流的俱乐部，加入了 Alexis Ohanian、Mike Shinoda 和 Stephen Curry 等名人。我们希望看到**在游戏世界中扩展我们的 NFT**，这就是这些 NFT 头像项目发挥作用的地方。\n\n>

RTFKT （[ETH上惊艳你我的NFT项目抢先看](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDc0MzI4Mw==&mid=2648746012&idx=1&sn=7be836edfee261a1b6762134442cf506&chksm=be5427808923ae96af42f28d079b38bbe9bc1360a7b26124e06cd46cbdc21b5d88c85f5e6776&scene=21#wechat_redirect)）的设计表中出现了 Clone X，这是一个与各种实用程序一起启动的化身项目。那些能够声称或购买 Clone X 角色 NFT 的人，也将在更广泛的元宇宙中获得实用性。20000 个 NFT 化身中的每一个都将是完全 3D、自定义建模的，可以在各种虚拟世界中使用。细节尚未最终确定，但从 RTFKT 与 Decentraland 的历史以及 Somnium Space 的完整头像支持来看，我们可以填补这些点。当然，VR Chat、Webaverse 和其他虚拟环境也可以使用。Clone X 还没有出现，但这是一个值得关注的项目。\n\n**官网：clonex.rtfkt.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FJyqGs-NOJjN0FPmiPpA_Q.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**无聊猿俱乐部**\n\n当下最受关注的 NFT 项目之一是 Bored Ape Yacht Club。拥有一只无聊的猿让你成为一个由创新者和投资者组成的包容性社区的一部分。但是我们没有听说在现实世界中穿 Bored Ape 毛衣，因为我们正在寻找那些游戏机会。BAYC 最近公布了他们的无聊猿和突变猿的路线图，你猜怎么着？每个 NFT 持有者都会有 3D 模型，The Sandbox 中会有一个 BAYC VX Apes 世界，一个团队正在开发一款绝密的区块链游戏。现在，无聊猿是进入社区的入口，很快这些将成为虚拟环境中的代表。\n\n**官网：boredapeyachtclub.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FC1HpPM0TFRpV_R0GgnJiG.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Voxies**\n\n我们以前写过关于 Voxies 的文章，这并非没有道理。这些体素角色可能看起来像 The Sandbox 中的美眉，但这是不正确的。Voxies 是可收藏的 NFT，可以用作您的个人资料图片。然而，查看它们的元数据并了解它们在游戏中的表现更为重要。因为 Voxies 将成为即将到来的游戏 Voxie Tactics 中的游戏角色。在战术回合制 RPG 中，玩家使用他们的 Voxies 与敌人作战并智取对手。良好的定位和战术执行将使球员和他们的 Voxies 为胜利做好准备。Voxies NFT 头像总是应该成为更大游戏产品的一部分。\n\n**官网：voxies.io**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fqu6KtGVOUYzQXO3-sltku.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**绒毛世界**\n\nFluf World 是一个由 10000 个 NFT 组成的集合，已经在雷达下航行了很长一段时间，直到它们得到了 Outlier Ventures 的支持。这些 NFT 化身将音乐与其视觉设计相结合。难怪 Fluf World NFT 将成为实体和虚拟音乐会、节日和体验的门票。NFT 所有者可以很快下载他们的 3D 模型，为支持虚拟环境的用户做好准备。此外，Flufs 将获得 AI，将拥有自己的虚拟世界，并且他们将获得自己的代币：Mycelium。育种是 Fluf World 游戏赚钱经济的第一步，但事情不会就此止步。角色所有者也对 NFT 拥有完全的商业权利，从而为新的业务关系打开了生态系统。\n\n**官网：fluf.world**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F_v5183LNcalovVk-KkILq.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Vox**\n\nGala Games 一直致力于开发各种游戏，包括 Town Star 和 Mirandus。此外，他们还有各种第三方开发人员正在开发，例如 Spider Tanks 和 Echoes of Empire。但是，我们在这里谈论 Vox。这些体素角色拥有自己的虚拟世界，目前仅用于社交。每个 Vox NFT 都有自己的外观、工作和个性。拥有 NFT 后，用户还可以访问 FBX 文件，从而允许在其他世界中进行集成。将 Vox NFT 化身放入 Town Star 将在游戏时生成 TOWN 代币，同时也增加了一些 DeFi 收益农场实用程序。\n\n**官网：collectvox.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FObbAJAWvjxqHP_Ap2-edy.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Aavegotchi**\n\n虽然每个人都在谈论将代币添加到 NFT 集合中，但 Aavegotchi 已经这样做了将近一年。他们的像素幽灵装满了代币，穿着有价值的 NFT 衣服，并在 Rarity Farming 活动中生成 GHST。为了增加项目的复杂性，该团队现在在 Gotchiverse 上工作。这个虚拟世界将允许 NFT 所有者使用他们的 Gotchi 化身进行游戏。最终，这些被动像素化钱包现在将成为大型多人在线角色扮演游戏中的虚拟角色。\n\n**官网：aavegotchi.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FLLDNheDCc5Gsgvxr7H-Z-.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Habbo Avatars**\n\n二十年前，Habbo Hotel 通过创建一个让许多青少年相互联系的社交虚拟空间，成为先驱者之一。二十年后的今天，他们推出了 Habbo Avatars，这是一种独特的 NFT 化身，将在 Habbo 的虚拟世界中可用。此外，NFT 所有者将有资格获得奖励、空投和特殊活动。这些是今年的计划。Habbo 想进军赚钱的领域。开发人员希望将游戏赚钱机制整合到 Habbo 和 Hotel Hideaway 中，因此我们可以期待在 2022 年为早期的 Habbo Avatar 支持者提供更多实用性。Habbo Avatars 显然使用 NFT 化身将他们的游戏世界向新经济开放。\n\n**官网：nft.habbo.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FAZoQYzVh_-iiLMimVdPht.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Metakrew**\n\nMetakrew 是 9750 个随机生成的 NFT 化身，在元宇宙中具有直接实用性。该项目将于 11 月启动，并且还将具有一些许可品牌特征。每个 2D 化身都带有从相同元数据生成的 3D 角色。这些 3D Metakrew 角色将与即将于 2022 年发布的首个游戏兼容。此外，这些角色将与其他虚拟世界兼容。明年，由 Matty aka DCLBlogger 领导的团队也将启动一个宠物项目。\n\n**官网：themetakey.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fw789A-x82RGuuxSZIwnM5.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Hashmasks**\n\n2021 年初，Hashmasks 作为一个新的 NFT 艺术项目推出，并由于炒作迅速登上了头条。可以说，这是我们仍在经历的 NFT 化身炒作周期的开始。8 月，Hashmasks 团队宣布将该项目转移到游戏和虚拟世界中。该团队将委托开发一款视频游戏，该游戏使用原始艺术品或基于 NFT 艺术品空投的 NFT 化身。尽管尚未透露有关该游戏的更多详细信息（可能甚至还没有真正开始开发），但开发人员确实注意到它将具有游戏赚钱机制。\n\n**官网：thehashmasks.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FkGHdzsjju6yxZ_ICwTobv.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Meebits**\n\n2021 年 5 月，每位 CryptoPunk 所有者都获得了免费的 Meebit NFT，而其他人则可以通过 2.5 ETH 的荷兰拍卖获得 Meebit。尽管 Meebits 有点被遗忘了，但 Larva Labs 的 NFT 集合确实引入了一个特殊功能：作为虚拟世界中的 3D 头像的实用程序。NFT 所有者可以使用 OBJ 文件将他们的 Meebit 导入到 VR 聊天、Somnium Space 或其他 VR 环境中。作为最早的 3D 化身之一，或者可以说是第一个，Meebits 确实具有一定的历史意义。现在想象一下，你可以使用 Meebit 来玩任何游戏。这很酷！\n\n**官网：meebits.larvalabs.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FhJeyLhP7CW0nha9JtRHzL.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Deadfellaz**\n\nDeadfellaz 是 NFT 的卡通僵尸合集，在社区中引起了不小的关注。事实上，Elijah “Frodo” Wood 是他们社区的一部分。该团队目前正在制定其路线图的 2.0 版本，但他们已经宣布每个 Deadfellaz NFT 都可以访问 ta 3D 操纵的化身角色。然后，他们将能够在各种虚拟世界中使用这些文件，从 VR 聊天到 Zoom 会议，从 Webaverse 到 Somnium Space。该团队将在万圣节前后在 Decentraland 开设自己的区域，并将其命名为 Deadzone 13。\n\n**官网：www.deadfellaz.io**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fz_3uClYepMTboJ7bbKXQR.png&w=1200&q=90)\n\n**Visitors of Imma Degen (VOID)**\n\n虽然许多化身项目后来推出了他们的 3D 化身，但 Imma Degen 的访客从一开始就玩了这个游戏。这些 Imma Degen 的访问者或简单的 VOID NFT 都已准备好在虚拟世界中使用。所有者对其角色拥有完全的商业权利。NFT 所有者可以在 Somnium Space 中使用他们的角色，社区也有自己的聚会地点。NFT VOID 虚拟形象真的是为游戏而生的，尤其是用于修改现有游戏。是的，您可以使用自己的 VOID 角色在 Grand Theft Auto 中四处奔跑！该团队还推出了 WynLambo，这是一种与 VOID 配套的类似宠物的 NFT，同时他们现在正在扩展 VOID 2.0 的路线图。\n\n**官网：immadegen.com**\n\n>

{"id": "a_GAMNpZPIpDngz24sJ33dZqXMZnE6Q5tA-obX1SyLA", "title": "Presenting the Revert Compoundor", "body": "We’re excited about releasing a new feature today for Uniswap v3 Liquidity Providers: **fee auto-compounding.**\n\nWe think this will be useful for LPs depending on how long they plan to hold positions and what they expect their **Fee APR** to be going forward.\n\nIn Uniswap v3 compounding of fees does not occur automatically, as it does on its predecessor, and manual compounding of fees requires doing a few different contract interactions and calculations to:\n\n1. Collect fees via the Uniswap NFT Manager contract.\n2. Possibly check the amounts of token0 and token1 required to swap so as to maximize the amount of liquidity added to the position.\n3. Possibly perform the required swap.\n4. Add the tokens as liquidity to the position.\n\nAdditionally because fees do not grow at a constant rate, and the cost of compounding is a multiple of the gas price, to compound optimally requires constant monitoring of a position.\n\nBecause gas prices determine the cost of compounding, the deployment of Uniswap v3 on low gas price chains means that a much larger proportion of positions would be optimally compounded a much greater number of times that on mainnet.\n\nTo automate the above process we are releasing a simple protocol: Revert Compoundor.\n\nPositions managed by the Compoundor contract can be auto-compounded by anyone. The ***autoCompound*** function takes any uncollected fees for a position, optionally swaps them to a determined ratio given the position range and the current pool price, and adds it as liquidity to the position.\n\nA small fraction of the *collected-and-compounded* fees are paid to the protocol and to compensate the accounts call the auto-compound function for their gas costs incurred. This performance fee is set to 2% on launch and by design can only be decreased, never increased.\n\nAdditionally once a position is added to the Compoundor protocol contract, the position owner is able to conveniently execute the ***autoCompound*** function at any time, in which case there are no fees charged aside from the regular gas costs of executing the call.\n\nWe are publishing a draft of a [whitepaper](https://hackmd.io/@revert/BJcGIJQ35) that explains how the protocol works and how we are estimating the expected benefits of auto-compounding for any position.\n\nAdditionally the protocol contracts have had an open bug bounty on Immunefi since June 14th.\n\n[https://github.com/revert-finance/compoundor](https://github.com/revert-finance/compoundor)\n\n[https://immunefi.com/bounty/revert/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/revert/)\n\nTo give it a try just visit your positions dashboard, and for any v3 position you will see a “Compound Fees” button at the bottom, by clicking on it a panel will expand that will show you the estimated benefits of auto-compounding your position given the current fee APRs.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D__XmTnOagS4ZCETk1gbN.png?height=3092&width=2196)\n\nThe total yearly improvement, and the time to break-even, will depend on each positions’ performance. Depending on each LPs strategy and expectations, auto-compounding might not be ideal. Particularly on high gas-price environments like Ethereum mainnet, auto-compounding should be attractive mostly to LPs with very high fee apr, or long expected time range on their positions.\n\nWe are also excited about launching this protocol/feature today simultaneously on [Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code), [Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code), [Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code), and [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code).\n\nSo we hope you try it out, check if it makes sense for your current or future Uniswap v3 positions, and if you have any questions or comments, drop by our discord.", "timestamp": 1658167370, "digest": "CTbjZOjGcoDXd0EBy_f5BzOGA6f8TUmAlsM4Z2DVMaI", "contributor": "0x8cadb20A4811f363Dadb863A190708bEd26245F8"}

Organizations solicit personal data for access to their services and platforms. These barriers to entry can lead to exclusivity and discrimination. A user must create an account that provides at least a name and email, and often age, date of birth, race and ethnicity for every online act. This data is shared with third parties, subjecting the user to a harassment of unsolicited emails, ads, and messages. Once the information is in an entity's hands there is no telling what other uses it is exploited for.\n\n![Data Breach!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xQCN_s1oetGGdyoj6JhVd.jpeg?height=535&width=1024)\n\nThis process is repeated again and again for social media, retail, entertainment, event, financial, and professional accounts. The fracturing of our identity into countless pieces creates new vulnerabilities every time we engage with a service. The burden is on the user to manage access to all of these accounts for the privilege of private companies profiting from their data. This is an inefficient, broken system, without mentioning the challenges that arise if a password is forgotten.\n\nSimilarly, for every purchase made online the user has to enter their bank card or account information. This is a cumbersome and insecure process, creating new vulnerabilities when this data is transmitted or saved on a platforms centralized system. Blockchain technology solves the payment problem, requiring a user to simply sign a message to complete a transaction. However, payments are only one use case. Blockchain can also solve the broken identity management system, simply requiring message signing to access a new platform. The protocol that will make this possible is what we are building at Mu Methods.\n\n## The Solution\n\n![Singular Digital Identity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vg15xER5gUOTCUKdAPv9Q.jpeg?height=311&width=700)\n\nNo longer will a user need to give up personal information, creating a new account every time they want to access a service or join a community. When they access a new system it will only require a message to be signed in their wallet. Platforms will be connecting to their singular digital identity.\n\n### Identity Protocol\n\nTo accomplish this we have to fix the existing cryptographic identity system, then integrate it with payments and off-chain platforms. At Mu Methods we are laser-focused on step one: to provide a foundational identity infrastructure. Similar to the IPFS and blockchain solutions for p2p data transfer and asset management, our protocol is an open-source off-chain solution for public/private key management that can be utilized by any cryptographic identity provider. This network will address three primary issues: account linking, seed phrase recoverability, and decentralized application connectivity.\n\n### Account Linking\n\nCurrently connecting crypto accounts requires a user to import/export their seed phrase making it vulnerable to attack. If the seed phrase is unknown, they have to export it from their wallet. It may be stored incorrectly during this process, making it insecure. In addition, it adds a layer of complexity to the user experience. A user may create a new account every time they use a different wallet because they don't feel comfortable importing/exporting their seed phrase. Instead of importing/exporting our network will generate private linking keys to permission new accounts from a primary account, eliminating the need to access the seed phrase over and over again. Mu will generate permissioning private keys through state of the art signature schemes.\n\n### Seed Phrase Recoverability\n\nWhile this minimizes the need to access the seed phrase, it does not eliminate it. The current single failure point of recoverability is unsustainable and unscalable. If a user loses access to their account when they misplace their seed phrase they are unlikely to utilize it as a safe and secure method of identity and asset management. To solve recoverability for those instances in which a user has lost complete access to their account we will use key sharding. Instead of holding the entire seed phrase in one location it will be split and distributed among several nodes in the network. It is social recovery without the need of smart contracts or friends to distribute the shards to. If the user does not have trusted friends they will be provided with alternative locations for shard distribution. They will not be required to store their seed phrase.\n\n### Decentralized Application Connectivity\n\nIn order to transition to the single-tap connectivity necessary to access platforms with our digital ID's, wallet connect standards need an update. Currently a user needs to choose which wallet they are connecting from to communicate with a dapp. Our network will remove this step, no longer requiring the user to choose their wallet. When a dapp proposes to sign a transaction it will go through our network to be signed by any device key. Rather than requesting the local account, the dapp is told what account is going to sign for which transaction. All keys will act from one device/account.\n\n### Verified Credentials\n\nOnce these features are functioning the personal identification details required to engage with certain platforms ie. name, age, address, email, social security number, etc. can be securely stored with the network. These proven personal identifiers are referred to as verified credentials. They are private and only accessible if a user permissions them to be. For example, when a bank requires verified identifiers to engage with a client the user can one-tap permission access to the specific and limited information requested.\n\n### Financial Transactions\n\nWhile crypto payments are functional, they are not scalable. We are closely following legislation in the US and abroad regarding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) and stable-coins. Once crypto is legally defined traditional platforms' compliance departments will have a clear path to accepting crypto payments. Integrating these into the digital identities built on our network will eliminate the attack vectors created when financial account information is exposed.\n\n## Transition\n\nWe will begin onboarding to the network through pull requests and wallet reviews of the largest wallet providers by Unique Active Wallets. Additionally we will build a proof of concept wallet to demonstrate the networks functionality and security best practices. These strategies will upgrade existing wallet infrastructure as well as set a standard for new wallet providers.\n\nOur vision will take several years to realize and require collaboration with companies across the Web3 ecosystem working on verified credentials, payment systems, and KYC integration. It is going to take many solutions to build this reality. If there are potential synergies between your product and ours, DM’s are open! We are eager to work together and build the future of self-sovereign identity.\n\n**Jugal Patel**  \n Co-Founder  \n t.

{"id": "Ar1St_ZTpZLKgu9sP0TU5gvW0YSLMzFupztzF3GYCVY", "title": "The Next Step to Self-Sovereign Identity", "body": "## The Problem\n\nThe current model of the internet does not empower the individual. Organizations solicit personal data for access to their services and platforms. These barriers to entry can lead to exclusivity and discrimination. A user must create an account that provides at least a name and email, and often age, date of birth, race and ethnicity for every online act. This data is shared with third parties, subjecting the user to a harassment of unsolicited emails, ads, and messages. Once the information is in an entity's hands there is no telling what other uses it is exploited for.\n\n![Data Breach!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xQCN_s1oetGGdyoj6JhVd.jpeg?height=535&width=1024)\n\nThis process is repeated again and again for social media, retail, entertainment, event, financial, and professional accounts. The fracturing of our identity into countless pieces creates new vulnerabilities every time we engage with a service. The burden is on the user to manage access to all of these accounts for the privilege of private companies profiting from their data. This is an inefficient, broken system, without mentioning the challenges that arise if a password is forgotten.\n\nSimilarly, for every purchase made online the user has to enter their bank card or account information. This is a cumbersome and insecure process, creating new vulnerabilities when this data is transmitted or saved on a platforms centralized system. Blockchain technology solves the payment problem, requiring a user to simply sign a message to complete a transaction. However, payments are only one use case. Blockchain can also solve the broken identity management system, simply requiring message signing to access a new platform. The protocol that will make this possible is what we are building at Mu Methods.\n\n## The Solution\n\n![Singular Digital Identity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vg15xER5gUOTCUKdAPv9Q.jpeg?height=311&width=700)\n\nNo longer will a user need to give up personal information, creating a new account every time they want to access a service or join a community. When they access a new system it will only require a message to be signed in their wallet. Platforms will be connecting to their singular digital identity.\n\n### Identity Protocol\n\nTo accomplish this we have to fix the existing cryptographic identity system, then integrate it with payments and off-chain platforms. At Mu Methods we are laser-focused on step one: to provide a foundational identity infrastructure. Similar to the IPFS and blockchain solutions for p2p data transfer and asset management, our protocol is an open-source off-chain solution for public/private key management that can be utilized by any cryptographic identity provider. This network will address three primary issues: account linking, seed phrase recoverability, and decentralized application connectivity.\n\n### Account Linking\n\nCurrently connecting crypto accounts requires a user to import/export their seed phrase making it vulnerable to attack. If the seed phrase is unknown, they have to export it from their wallet. It may be stored incorrectly during this process, making it insecure. In addition, it adds a layer of complexity to the user experience. A user may create a new account every time they use a different wallet because they don't feel comfortable importing/exporting their seed phrase. Instead of importing/exporting our network will generate private linking keys to permission new accounts from a primary account, eliminating the need to access the seed phrase over and over again. Mu will generate permissioning private keys through state of the art signature schemes.\n\n### Seed Phrase Recoverability\n\nWhile this minimizes the need to access the seed phrase, it does not eliminate it. The current single failure point of recoverability is unsustainable and unscalable. If a user loses access to their account when they misplace their seed phrase they are unlikely to utilize it as a safe and secure method of identity and asset management. To solve recoverability for those instances in which a user has lost complete access to their account we will use key sharding. Instead of holding the entire seed phrase in one location it will be split and distributed among several nodes in the network. It is social recovery without the need of smart contracts or friends to distribute the shards to. If the user does not have trusted friends they will be provided with alternative locations for shard distribution. They will not be required to store their seed phrase.\n\n### Decentralized Application Connectivity\n\nIn order to transition to the single-tap connectivity necessary to access platforms with our digital ID's, wallet connect standards need an update. Currently a user needs to choose which wallet they are connecting from to communicate with a dapp. Our network will remove this step, no longer requiring the user to choose their wallet. When a dapp proposes to sign a transaction it will go through our network to be signed by any device key. Rather than requesting the local account, the dapp is told what account is going to sign for which transaction. All keys will act from one device/account.\n\n### Verified Credentials\n\nOnce these features are functioning the personal identification details required to engage with certain platforms ie. name, age, address, email, social security number, etc. can be securely stored with the network. These proven personal identifiers are referred to as verified credentials. They are private and only accessible if a user permissions them to be. For example, when a bank requires verified identifiers to engage with a client the user can one-tap permission access to the specific and limited information requested.\n\n### Financial Transactions\n\nWhile crypto payments are functional, they are not scalable. We are closely following legislation in the US and abroad regarding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) and stable-coins. Once crypto is legally defined traditional platforms' compliance departments will have a clear path to accepting crypto payments. Integrating these into the digital identities built on our network will eliminate the attack vectors created when financial account information is exposed.\n\n## Transition\n\nWe will begin onboarding to the network through pull requests and wallet reviews of the largest wallet providers by Unique Active Wallets. Additionally we will build a proof of concept wallet to demonstrate the networks functionality and security best practices. These strategies will upgrade existing wallet infrastructure as well as set a standard for new wallet providers.\n\nOur vision will take several years to realize and require collaboration with companies across the Web3 ecosystem working on verified credentials, payment systems, and KYC integration. It is going to take many solutions to build this reality. If there are potential synergies between your product and ours, DM’s are open! We are eager to work together and build the future of self-sovereign identity.\n\n**Jugal Patel** \n Co-Founder  \n t.

Meneer hoeft alleen zijn brood niet meer, gisteravond ook al moeilijk met het eten. Ook slapen had hij weinig zin in, moeten er bij blijven anders gaat hij huilen. Dus 2 uur laten huilen, met om en om 15 minuten even kort kijken. Dat wordt weer even dagelijks opbouwen voor zowel eten als slapen.  \n Update einde van de week: het slapen gaat steeds beter de goede kant op, we starten met voorlezen in deze hitte (en Morris bleek ziek te zijn deze week) en daarna doen we gewoon weglopen en om de 15 minuten kort kijken. Eten is allemaal goed gekomen, hij eet weer lekker mee. Wilt wel graag zelf eten, echt wel al een klein willetje \n* Contact gehad met de airdrop mensen en website issues verholpen rondom de mint. Titan aantal einde van de week staat op 53 titans van 35 unieke mensen. We zijn gestart.\n* Verder een ontspannen dag, veel kleine dingen opgepakt en gestart met Jansesn Journal op mirror (zie vorige post). \n* Ook toegevoegd: Imovie compilatie met de weekfoto’s (te vinden op de harde schijf atm) \n* Hanneke van Dam geholpen aan het einde van de dag met het minten van haar NFT en even lekker bijgepraat. Deze tech is echt nog lang niet klaar voor het grote publiek, ze liep op diverse onderdelen nog vast omdat het compleet nieuw is. Gelachen, kreeg veel energie van het gesprek. Idee: instapcursus/instaples voor complete beginners in het Nederlands op YouTube plaatsen. Samen met Saar en Joep de stappen doorlopen en uitleggen hoe alles werkt, dit opnemen en op YT zetten. \n* Eerste reacties op de NFTs zijn positief. \n* Ronde met Rowin gelpoen: inkopen positie op OtherSide NFT? Laten lopen uiteindelijk, gevoelsmatig ech tveel te overbetaald en overhyped. \n* DAO Funds overgemaakt naar de multisig. 5K. Ook op dit onderdeel zijn we voor het eggie gestart. Ik kan het gevoel maar niet afschudden dat alles wat we hier doen het begin is van een legendarisch traject. \n* Juna & Jack op date, samen eten in de speeltuin haha :-D \n* Idee: windvanger in de tuin hangen met van die chimes. Uiteindelijk zijn het schelpen aan een hanger geworden, ook mooi! \n* Gelachen met de KPN glasvezelkabelmannen. Was een jonkie mee die zijn eerste dag had (met zijn buurman), binnen gelaten en de mannen wat limo gegeven. Komt er eindelijk dan glasvezel aan (afspraak wordt later gemaakt)\n* Imovie dus gemaakt, uiteindelijk gekozen voor de auto compilatie ivm tijd. \n* MI2 gekeken, wederom leuk! \n* Energie los laten gooien (Saar drukt met elleboog op beide binnenbenen en werkt vanuit knie omhoog naar lies via binnenkant dij in groef). Veel losgekomen, voelde goed, negatieve energie en ijzeren grip in mijn hoofd kwam los. Erg veel gedroomd, dus misschien beter om in de ochtend te doen \n\n## Dinsdag 12 juli\n\n* 6 minuten plan. Hardop schreeuwen, ondersteund met muziek om stem in mijn hoofd te overschreeuwen en af te leiden. Zo zie je dat je de grens behoorlijk kan verleggen als je die klotestem soms uitzet. Niet altijd blij met de stem in mijn hoofd dus blijkbaar.\n* Minder keelpijn. Update: achteraf bleek dat het nog een flinke zit werd deze week, nog steeds wel last en vermoeid alleen lijkt het nu wel de goede kant op te gaan. \n* Meiden alles zelfstandig voorbereid voor het strand (ingesmeerd, badpakjes aan, saar was al naar werk haha) \n* Instaples opgezet zoals besproken op ma 11 juli: Jor & Saar - crypto dummies. Leuk om neer te zetten. \n  * Superfood report binnen geharkt. Samenvattend:  \n My superfoods: bruine rijst, kersen, cocoa 70%, dille, vijgen, lam, nectarine, oats, haver, olijven, oregano, papaya, persimmon, dadelpruim, pomegranate, raspberry, wilde zalm, sauerkraut, sweet papato or yam, watermelon, white mushroom \n Ontwijken: artichoke, aspergus, beef, bell pepper (paprika), brocolli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, caviar or roe, cod (kabeljauw), crayfish (rivierkreeft), eigeel, goat, haddock (schelvis), lobster, mustard greens, scallops, pepino melon, shrimp, tomaat, turmeric, turnip, venison or elk (eland). \n* Meiden naar het strand gegaan, papa na lange twijfel toch thuis gebleven. \n\n## Woensdag 13 juli\n\n* 15 jaar verkering :-) Morris opgepakt op wederom onmogelijke tijd, met de meiden ontbijt op bed gemaakt, klusjes gedaan en gelijk vol gas gegaan ipv rustig aan gedaan en mijn rust gepakt. Ook icm de kijkles etc. De prijs later op de dag dubbel en dwars betaald: charijnig doordat ik zo moe was (vermodelijk ook door virus). \n* In de ochtend was het wel een waar circus en ontbijt op bed in 1. \n* Kijkzwemles was ook erg leuk: wat deden ze het goed! Papa gaat ook les nemen van Heidi, goed instapmoment wel nog te kiezen (even over de drempel heen). Gefietst naar Voorhout, heerijk. \n* Geluksmoment: thee valt weer om, ditmaal over het bureau, maar niets werd geraakt wat schade opleverde. Alles viel naast mij en naast de spullen, mogelijk wel het bibliotheekboek vies uds even berichten bij de bieb. Update: schoon gemaakt, karma test doorstaan :-) \n* Biertje in de Veen was gezellig, even met Rowin bijgepraat. Echter de rit naartoe was niet leuk, veel te chagrijnig en moe. Had het even niet meer. \n* In de avond eten voorschoten ging het wel weer een beetje, maar nog steeds erg moe en zeker niet happy. Wachten op eten duurde lang en uit eten met Moor is gewoon pittig omdat je veel te veel met hem bezig moet zijn (vliegt alle kanten op haha)\n* Koios busines model uitgewerkt met focus op de bal, zie 14 juli uitwerking\n* Juna geen onderbroek mee op de terugweg, arme meid haha\n* Morris mama goed geholpen met het meebezemen en schoonmaken van de tuin! \n* MI3, ijs, heerlijk geslapen! \n* 15 mooie rode rozen voor mijn geweldige vrouw gehaald, was is het toch echt een prachtig wezen op elke manier hoe een mens kan zijn. Mooie kanten, minder mooie kanten. Ze is.\n* \n\n## Donderdag 14 Juli \n\n* Goed geslapen, enkel het dunne hoeslaken en vermoeidheid (flink!) deden denk de truc. \n* Veel in mijn hoofdmet allerlei plannen. Ik onderneem nu geen radicale grote stappen, enkel kleintjes. Met hyperfocus. Mogelijk vermoeid en nu wat energie komt duiken we gelijk weer de diepte in. HOLD!!\n* Met Moor gedouched. Hij vindt het zitten leuk, met ramenwiser, maar wilt niet te dicht met zijn bol bij de straal. En ook niet getild worden. \n* Vandaag komt de kast :-) Update: toch niet, kwam uiteindelijk vrjidag 15 juli, is erg mooi! \n* Met Joepie gaan eten, was nog steeds erg moe om er vol van te genieten, dus gaan we snel even goed over doen. \n* Shiatsu, was de laatste massage omdat Sebastiaan (van Leeuwen) er vandoor gaat. Hoofd voelt als lood, ogen moe, keelpijn. Lijkt wel los te komen, tuk gedaan \n* Heidi voor zwemles gecontact\n* Toekomst van speels Koios in een droom gezien: digitaal, pretparkachtig, vogelvlucht kon je alles overzien, in 3D, kon je iets selecteren en dan inzoomen (alsof je van vogelvlucht erin dook, daar zag je dan vervolgens het spel spelen met de anderen deelnemers en kijkers eromheen! Essentieel: iedereen was eigenaar van zijn/haar eigen stukje van de plattegrond. Deel van de kaart was algemeen bezit, maar in het noorden was de speeltuin en daar bezaten mensen eigen bezit. \n* Hele leuke film gezien in café Druk mijn Snor: Sea Beast. Inclusief B&Jerry\n* Morris eet weer goed. Wel speen overdag en die gaan we dus wegdoen vanaf nu. Update: Dit lijkt lekker te lopen. Ook het in slaap vallen met weglopen gaat stuk beter! \n* Flinke ingeving voor Koios verbetervoorstellen. Heeft uiteindelijk geleidt tot een klein document met mini roadmap voor september. Met Titan Trollbox iedereen individueel rondom de tafel zitten en meningen verzamelen. \n\nVrijdag 15 en zaterdag 16 juli \n\n* Vergeten leuke dingen bij te houden! Oeps, merk ook dat het daardoor wat minder ‘chill / flowerig’ verloopt. RUST pakken Jor :-) \n* De BBq met de fam en kids was geweldig, vooral de avondbioscoop vond ik superleuk voor de kids om te doen (herinneringen maken). Lieke natuurlijk ook uitgenodigd. \n* Naar de markt met de meiden (race gewonnen wie als eerst beneden was!), mooie bloemen op de markt kunnen vinden, fruit was ook erg goed en superfoods ingeslagen uit rapport. \n* 1 op 1 met Fiene in de bios (was wel moe, god was is dat vervelend)\n* Patatjes met ijs als avondeten! \n* 10 tellen in de rimboe gedaan met de kids \n* Geverfd! Mooi geworden \n* Tuin opgeknapt en nieuwe dressoir geinstalleerd. Nieuwe TV is next (is besteld op maandag de 18e)\n\nZondag 17 juli\n\n* heerlijk gewandeld met ma in Amsterdamse waterleidingduinen.

Organizations solicit personal data for access to their services and platforms. These barriers to entry can lead to exclusivity and discrimination. A user must create an account that provides at least a name and email, and often age, date of birth, race and ethnicity for every online act. This data is shared with third parties, subjecting the user to a harassment of unsolicited emails, ads, and messages. Once the information is in an entity's hands there is no telling what other uses it is exploited for.\n\n![Data Breach!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xQCN_s1oetGGdyoj6JhVd.jpeg?height=535&width=1024)\n\nThis process is repeated again and again for social media, retail, entertainment, event, financial, and professional accounts. The fracturing of our identity into countless pieces creates new vulnerabilities every time we engage with a service. The burden is on the user to manage access to all of these accounts for the privilege of private companies profiting from their data. This is an inefficient, broken system, without mentioning the challenges that arise if a password is forgotten.\n\nSimilarly, for every purchase made online the user has to enter their bank card or account information. This is a cumbersome and insecure process, creating new vulnerabilities when this data is transmitted or saved on a platforms centralized system. Blockchain technology solves the payment problem, requiring a user to simply sign a message to complete a transaction. However, payments are only one use case. Blockchain can also solve the broken identity management system, simply requiring message signing to access a new platform. The protocol that will make this possible is what we are building at Mu Methods.\n\n## The Solution\n\n![Singular Digital Identity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vg15xER5gUOTCUKdAPv9Q.jpeg?height=311&width=700)\n\nNo longer will a user need to give up personal information, creating a new account every time they want to access a service or join a community. When they access a new system it will only require a message to be signed in their wallet. Platforms will be connecting to their singular digital identity.\n\n### Identity Protocol\n\nTo accomplish this we have to fix the existing cryptographic identity system, then integrate it with payments and off-chain platforms. At Mu Methods we are laser-focused on step one: to provide a foundational identity infrastructure. Similar to the IPFS and blockchain solutions for p2p data transfer and asset management, our protocol is an open-source off-chain solution for public/private key management that can be utilized by any cryptographic identity provider. This network will address three primary issues: account linking, seed phrase recoverability, and decentralized application connectivity.\n\n### Account Linking\n\nCurrently connecting crypto accounts requires a user to import/export their seed phrase making it vulnerable to attack. If the seed phrase is unknown, they have to export it from their wallet. It may be stored incorrectly during this process, making it insecure. In addition, it adds a layer of complexity to the user experience. A user may create a new account every time they use a different wallet because they don't feel comfortable importing/exporting their seed phrase. Instead of importing/exporting our network will generate private linking keys to permission new accounts from a primary account, eliminating the need to access the seed phrase over and over again. Mu will generate permissioning private keys through state of the art signature schemes.\n\n### Seed Phrase Recoverability\n\nWhile this minimizes the need to access the seed phrase, it does not eliminate it. The current single failure point of recoverability is unsustainable and unscalable. If a user loses access to their account when they misplace their seed phrase they are unlikely to utilize it as a safe and secure method of identity and asset management. To solve recoverability for those instances in which a user has lost complete access to their account we will use key sharding. Instead of holding the entire seed phrase in one location it will be split and distributed among several nodes in the network. It is social recovery without the need of smart contracts or friends to distribute the shards to. If the user does not have trusted friends they will be provided with alternative locations for shard distribution. They will not be required to store their seed phrase.\n\n### Decentralized Application Connectivity\n\nIn order to transition to the single-tap connectivity necessary to access platforms with our digital ID's, wallet connect standards need an update. Currently a user needs to choose which wallet they are connecting from to communicate with a dapp. Our network will remove this step, no longer requiring the user to choose their wallet. When a dapp proposes to sign a transaction it will go through our network to be signed by any device key. Rather than requesting the local account, the dapp is told what account is going to sign for which transaction. All keys will act from one device/account.\n\n### Verified Credentials\n\nOnce these features are functioning the personal identification details required to engage with certain platforms ie. name, age, address, email, social security number, etc. can be securely stored with the network. These proven personal identifiers are referred to as verified credentials. They are private and only accessible if a user permissions them to be. For example, when a bank requires verified identifiers to engage with a client the user can one-tap permission access to the specific and limited information requested.\n\n### Financial Transactions\n\nWhile crypto payments are functional, they are not scalable. We are closely following legislation in the US and abroad regarding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) and stable-coins. Once crypto is legally defined traditional platforms' compliance departments will have a clear path to accepting crypto payments. Integrating these into the digital identities built on our network will eliminate the attack vectors created when financial account information is exposed.\n\n## Transition\n\nWe will begin onboarding to the network through pull requests and wallet reviews of the largest wallet providers by Unique Active Wallets. Additionally we will build a proof of concept wallet to demonstrate the networks functionality and security best practices. These strategies will upgrade existing wallet infrastructure as well as set a standard for new wallet providers.\n\nOur vision will take several years to realize and require collaboration with companies across the Web3 ecosystem working on verified credentials, payment systems, and KYC integration. It is going to take many solutions to build this reality. If there are potential synergies between your product and ours, DM’s are open! We are eager to work together and build the future of self-sovereign identity.\n\n**Jugal Patel**  \n Co-Founder  \n t.

It is going to take many solutions to build this reality. If there are potential synergies between your product and ours, DM’s are open! We are eager to work together and build the future of self-sovereign identity.\n\n**Jugal Patel**  \n Co-Founder  \n t.

Die Twitter Follower Zahl ist bereits auf über **100k** angestiegen, obwohl die App bisher nur in der Alpha Version und im BSC Testnetz verfügbar war. \n  \n Wir können uns also auf **tolles Marketing** und spannende Partnerschaften freuen, vor Allem sollen **Spitzensportler** an Bord geholt werden.\n\n![](https://befitter.io/assets/sec2/lease.png)\n\n### Soll ich in beFITTER investieren?\n\nDiese Frage musst du dir selbst beantworten.

{"id": "Usz2d7EUowa-09JuYALMARNblpA7PAUineVm_QKubbo", "title": "Should Cannabis Genome DAO Own A Lab?", "body": "## Web3 Is About Aligning Incentives\n\nWe think the genomic testing world could use a little more transparency and emphasis on the rights of individuals to control their data. This initiative would make Cannabis Genome DAO the first digital cooperative to maintain an ownership stake in a physical laboratory. As such, Cannabis Genome DAO would be granted full rights of a member of the company with access to financial reporting and an ability to ensure that the fidelity and transparency of laboratory practices are maintained. The alignment of incentives and governance rights between a community that benefits from using the laboratory, with the governance and incentives of the laboratory operations itself, directly benefits the community and users of the laboratories services.\n\n## Overview of Proposed Crowdfund\n\nFunding would go toward purchasing a membership interest in Delta Leaf, which is currently undergoing equity fundraising in pursuit of a traditional VC investment or strategic partnership from another organization. This provides the opportunity for Cannabis Genome DAO to fill that need. Funding from the sale of membership interest in Delta Leaf would be used for improving and expanding their services. These services include an upgrade to the Delta Leaf web app that would enable users to manage their laboratory results using self-custodial web3 wallets with the option to publish directly to the data marketplace being developed by Cannabis Genome DAO. Governance of Delta Leaf would be aligned with the mission and values of Cannabis Genome DAO because members of the latter would exert a significant amount of direct control over the operations of the former.\n\nThe crowdfund would be hosted here on Mirror and structured as a sale of a collection of tiered NFT editions. More information below.\n\n* [Cannabis Genome DAO](https://cannabisgeno.me) (“CGD”) would purchase a 20% membership interest in [Delta Leaf Laboratories LLC](https://deltaleaflabs.com) (“Delta Leaf”), a California Limited Liability Corporation.\n* Cannabis Genome DAO (“CGD\") is a \"[nonprofit association](https://ipfs//bafybeifzhrfh47zq743j35hq7v6lwmoqizzj665hwp7zzoqig6abveog6i/?filename=Delaware_UNA_Agreement_-_CGD.pdf)\" under the Delaware Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, §§ 1901-1916. CGD is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a partnership.\n* Governance of the CGD’s membership interest in Delta Leaf would be managed through the distribution of DLL tokens to members of CGD who contribute to this fundraiser.\n* The total DLL token supply would exclusively distribute governance rights to CGD members and does not distribute ownership right in Delta Leaf to individual members of CGD.\n* DLL tokens would not, and will not, represent any financial claim by individual CGD members to potential profit or obligation to potential losses incurred by CGD while CGD is acting as a member of Delta Leaf.\n* CGD and the CGD treasury would incur all financial profit and loss related to membership of CGD in Delta Leaf. The proceeds of this crowdfund will be sent to the CGD community multi-sig for the explicit purpose of completing the purchase of a membership interest in Delta Leaf as described herein.\n\n![Felipe's cousin Isaac made this graphic years ago.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D9MgsIfEXNqBfUuhtGwnJ.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n## DLL Token Allocations\n\nGovernance of Delta Leaf comprises a subset of the proposed activities encompassed by the [CGD Community Hyperthesis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/182fZ2WIQCL15O0TbQmkaJFM8tci06czuuqTMzBl_-zs/edit?usp=sharing). Therefore, the token allocation will primarily be distributed directly to participants in the crowdfunding campaign with only 20% being reserved for community management by CGD itself.

{"id": "pU_elmalCUXkcTVmcCmQxfynX8iPJ3-ftRLiIQalWSM", "title": "What DAOs Can Learn from Rainbow — 50yrs of Decentralized Autonomous Gathering", "body": "## The Immense Potential of DAOs\n\nFor an in-depth yet beginner friendly introduction to DAOs, please check out [this NYTimes article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/what-are-daos.html).\n\nHistorically, centralized power seemed to have obviously ‘won’ against the decentralized crowd —— we have witnessed how local faiths overpowered by organized religions, co-ops outcompeted by conglomerates, indigenous tribes eliminated by empires. We live in a world where profit incentives aren’t aligned with the common wealth and resources are shamefully extracted to maximize profit for individual gains.\n\nWithout doubt, technologies are best used to serve humanity’s overall well-being. Blockchain solutions can be used to realign our incentives, create equitable and transparent systems to avoid corruption and exploitation. The DAO space has huge potential to create **community-oriented autonomous templates to fundamentally decentralize the way humans operate** in order to **create abundance for all.**\n\n![Homemade meme about DAOs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TrgE2iuoFa1Fvi7OIiyOx.png?height=1011&width=1166)\n\nWithin a system that is transparent and fair, people would operate better because they ‘can’t do bad’ instead of ‘won’t do bad’. The Gitcoin’s theory on [ImpactDAOs](https://store.gitcoin.co/products/impactdao-book-digital-edition) did a deep dive into this philosophy.\n\nIt is worth noting that DAOs are still in its infancy, most DAOs are in its process of figuring out the best suited ways to govern. Many DAOs have very long and redundant execution processes as a protection against centralized dictatorship which often led to inefficiency and bureaucracy. Being born at the heart of the crypto industry, DAOs can be filled with pyramid scams and inflated values.\n\nBecause of the immaturity and capital-infested nature of crypto, learnings on the art of gathering and coordination may best come from outside of the DAO space. Humans have been organizing in swift and ingenue ways centuries before blockchain technology appeared.\n\nDAOs are schelling points for strangers to gather around a shared mission & vision and collectively accumulate resources to achieve this shared goal. —— This is exactly what [Rainbow Gathering](https://rainbowfamilygatherings.net/) has achieved in the past 50 years without blockchain.\n\n## What is the Rainbow Gathering?\n\n![Pic from SDBP Radio](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NHzQChJZjYJaW7Pb2-dou.png?height=542&width=880)\n\n*Special Thanks to [@mycobici](https://twitter.com/mycobici) for encouraging me to go to the 50 years Rainbow Gathering and drawing the analogy between Rainbow and DAOs. Special Thanks to [@imu](https://www.instagram.com/zenthebus/) for sending me courage, love and the Rainbow Gathering coordinate. 💕*\n\nI heard about the rainbow gathering from an off-grid eco village at the southern tip of Hilo, Hawaii.\n\n“It’s a gathering about peace, love and generosity. It is completely free to go and everything was shared in a gift-based society”, said someone from the eco village, who at the time refuses to have a cellphone or wear shoes.\n\n“There is no tickets, no social media. Location changes every year mostly in different national forests and the only way to find out is through word of mouth.\n\nThe gatherings also happen all around the world. Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Costa Rica, Mexico… and here on the Big Island! The main gathering is in the US every year, the main international gathering rotates around the world, and there are regionals happening all the time.”\n\nRainbow Gathering started in 1972, it is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Gathering) as a gathering where people ‘congregate in remote forests around the world for one or more weeks at a time with the stated intention of living a shared ideology of peace, harmony, freedom, and respect.’\n\nThe first gathering happened in Colorado where twenty thousand people faced police roadblocks, threatened [civil disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience), and were allowed onto [National Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Forest) land. It has spontaneously become a yearly tradition ever since.\n\nIn this anti-capitalist and anti-materialist world, people put up temporary cabins and tents, campfires and water filters, shared everything in a mutually respectful way. Regardless of cultural background or race, people shared a common language that is peace and love.\n\n![Pic of Rainbow from Sky-Hi News](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z2Savl-0dyYT_81p5EB0F.png?height=637&width=1024)\n\nIt is worth iterating that there are natural problems that come with the gathering, I do not wish to say that everything happens with the Rainbow community is always positive. The concerns about Rainbow Gathering will be claimed in the section in the end.\n\n## How Decentralized?\n\nThe gathering has no single leader, no corporation and usually no money involved except for some donations. All organizers gather and find common grounds cooperatively. Anyone that felt the urge to contribute can volunteer to organize since helping hands are always needed.\n\nAt each gathering, organizers would arrive weeks in advance to pave roads, study the terrain and plan out the locations. Different kitchen crews would put up camps with cookware, shelves, washing stations, toilet holes and sometimes showers. Individuals usually gather around the kitchens, enjoy the meals and help out when they can.\n\n![Reverse Osmosis Connected to River Water](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/By8WYji7f2M2sDBxgsCII.jpg?height=716&width=1000)\n\nEach camp has its own culture and quite unique characteristics. In the 50yr’s gathering in Colorado, **Instant Soup** served vegan soup 24/7 and always had elderly folks singing around campfire every night. **Wanna Burn** was a kitchen organized by nomad performers and fire spinners and they just felt like lovely pirates. I was told by the crew if anyone took out a cellphone at the kitchen it would get smashed. **Kids Village** as the name suggested were a fun space for kids to run around with small bridges and swings.\n\n![Pic from Atlas Obscura](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kqlMdmqaYgMyuQv4guELZ.png?height=2474&width=3235)\n\nEach kitchen dug its ‘compost’ holes for organic matters and buried them after they’re full. ‘Shitters’ were dug at various locations and ashes and dirt were put on them to avoid flies and diseases. All non-organic trash were carried out by volunteers as people started to leave. Crates from recycle companies were placed at the entrance of the gathering.\n\nAt the center you can find **Info Camp** where all info and activities can be found on bulletin boards, medical tents where student volunteers treated the sick and injured.\n\n![Map about the 2022 Gathering in Colorado](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z-ids5g5ZGXDsci0ACZ1q.png?height=1097&width=843)\n\nDuring the gathering, various events were celebrated and projects were made. On July 4th, everyone gathered in the main lawn and prayed in silence for world peace. People put together sweat lodges, had meetings about permaculture and eco villages. There was yoga and Tai-chi practices, poetry nights, music circles, fire dancing… Basically, if enough people want to make something happen, it would happen.\n\n## Unanimous Consensus\n\n![Rainbow Family Pic from Wikipedia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PWXQIX4NRhW0hSyHjU62x.jpg?height=900&width=1200)\n\nThe most important decision every gathering is where to have Rainbow next year. This decision is made by the ‘Vision Circle’ which is usually held at the end of each gathering. Anyone who shows up at the Vision Circle would may speak and hold voting power regardless of their expertise. Unanimous consensus is required for any decisions to be made, the Vision Circle sometimes take days to complete in order to reach consensus.\n\nI sat at the Vision Circle for hours just to observe the process, it reminds me of filibustering in politics. Although the difference is that anyone who wanted to speak can speak, and there is absolutely no interruption to anyone’s speech.\n\nMajority of people do not feel the need to participate in this decision making process. Since the location rotates every year across the US, it seems like a natural flow of evenly distributed choices.\n\nI do believe Vision Circle exists more for the spirit of making sure everyone’s voice is heard. **The nature of unanimous consensus symbolizes that individual satisfaction is less important than group cohesion and harmony, which in itself is a quite beautiful spirit for any organization.** There will always be someone dissatisfied in the end, but everyone still celebrates when a decision was made.\n\n## How Autonomous?\n\nThe idea of Rainbow got brought to different corners of the world by people attended the first few gatherings. It has shown that decentralized social movements can be ‘templatized’. Once the formula has been play-tested, it can be ‘forked’ to different places and adopted to its local culture.\n\n**The formula is intuitive and the message is simple and powerful.**\n\nJust like how [Maslow summarized universal structure of basic human needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html#:\\~:text=From%20the%20bottom%20of%20the,attend%20to%20needs%20higher%20up.), Rainbow summarized universal solutions about gathering in the forest.\n\nBasic survival practices such as: choosing location with the right climate and source of water, setting up kitchen with chopped wood, preparing filters for river water, digging ‘shitters’ and burying feces with ashes and soil so diseases don’t spread, having event calendar visible in central info station, having safe words and other codes of conducts… All these formula are simple enough to be put into a handbook that can be carried cross boarder and language and learned quite intuitively, most of them might already be known by experienced outdoor survivors.\n\nJust a good formula is not enough without a strong motivation to gather of course. Getting a group of unmotivated people to do things is harder than making pigs fly. For Rainbow, the motive to gather comes is simple and powerful, it is that **everybody is welcome in this gift-based society of love and peace** —— a message quite hard to say no to.\n\nAs long as people feel the need to gather, people would find ways to do so. The gathering is very much an organic and natural formation. Nothing is forced, nothing is paid for, nothing is for show, nothing is for sale. People gathered and united around a common mission in a completely authentic and compassionate way.\n\nJust like how songs and stories spread across continents way before the birth of telegraph or internet, just like a good meme, penetrating through firewalls and cultural differences, whenever an art form or a message resonates with people deeply and fundamentally, it will flow effortlessly for as far as it can.\n\n## The Giving Culture as a Schelling Point\n\nMany would say Rainbow is a counter culture movement, it is everything ‘default society’ is not. The Rainbow culture is simple enough to spread far across cultures and borders, yet profound enough to create amazing impact on individuals.\n\nIt’s quite fascinating to have hiked miles into deep forest to be offered massages and served organic vegan soup for as many times as you want, none of which cost anything.\n\nWe talk about ‘flipping the game theory’ and ‘incentive alignment’ a lot in the DAO space, and the folks at Rainbow did it in such a simple way ---- a demographic that supposedly has little wealth proved that achieving abundance with very little is possible. It really does make you rethink about post scarcity differently. Even thou it might not be long term sustainable and comes with its own set of problems, there are still things we can learn from.\n\nParadigm shift need to come from mental shift, or as the new age hippies would call it: a consciousness shift. I do believe that with any emerging communication or governance technology, **the cultural spirit would be at the center of any social movement.** There would be no social change without a mentality shift free of existing construct of exploitations and unhealthy competitions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nJust like a knife can be used to cut butter or to kill people, the technology can be misused if it wasn’t intentional. Just because DAOs share the same technology doesn’t mean they share the same principle of operations. DAOs can be ‘central banks’, they can be outright valueless scams, or continued exploitations with cycles of pump and dump.\n\n**We aim to create systems where people ‘can’t act bad’, but it’s also crucial to create a culture where people ‘don’t want to act bad’. These two aspects, the spirit and the form, should be treated with equal importance in order to co-create something beautiful. That’s when DAOs meet Rainbow.**\n\nDAOs are by nature community oriented, and the community would seed the culture of the DAO. I believe [DAOs have potential to change how we coordinate and operate in many ways](https://blog.aragon.org/10-industries-being-disrupted-by-daos/), with a precondition that their shared mission is **simple and clearly defined, with authentic passion adhering to one’s intrinsic value**, and hopefully, oriented towards creating better future for all living beings. ❤️\n\n## Disclaimer —— Warnings About Rainbow ⚠️\n\nWithout over glorifying Rainbow, it’s important to mention the negative aspects of its culture.\n\nBecause everyone is welcomed, there is no guarantee that everybody at the gathering will behave in a mutually respectful way. Because it is free, there is a natural influx of people who live on the streets without homes. Because of its emphasis on personal freedom, there is always an abundance of illegal drugs.\n\nBecause of the anti-capitalistic mentality as its spirit, many people choose to be **anti-productivity** as well. Lots of people choose not to work or do anything constructive, and it became a gateway to indulgence in hedonism and anti-accomplishment mentality. The press and rumors about Rainbow are also mostly negative for all these reasons.\n\n**Here’s my observation at the gathering:**\n\nGoing to the gathering by myself for the first time, I was unsure of what to expect and was on high alert, very soon I relaxed and felt right at home. I’ve had many fun conversations with various characters of all ages and cultural backgrounds, gypsy flow artists from Europe, qi-gong masters from China, energy healers from Israel, farmers from Iowa, intentional village organizers from Tennessee, nomads from Bosnia, musicians from Turkey… It was a fun and diverse group of people, I felt accepted, respected and most of the time enjoyed everyone’s company.\n\nThere was an abundance of psychedelic drugs and weed being shared at the gathering. Most of them given out for free to people who ask for them. Occasionally you would see people tripping hard and acting ‘over the top’, however, comparing to a regular music festival, I would say it actually has a lot less of non-sober people — which was a total surprise for me.\n\nRainbow was a lot more family oriented compare to regular music festivals. There were many kids and elderly, many people I met brought their parents. Preparing and sharing group meals and singing in music circles were the majority of the activities. I would personally bring my parents to a Rainbow Gathering but probably not Burning Man.\n\nThe only ‘iffy thing’ that I observed was when someone looked like in high adrenaline said another ‘crazy’ person was trying to attack him and he dodged away. It did remind me that this was an event that everyone is welcome and everything is allowed so we do have to be cautious.\n\nAlthough it might be inevitable to have zero trash and disturbance to the environment given the scale of the gathering, I do think the organizers and volunteers did their best to protect local environment, they would spend weeks cleaning up everything after everyone leaves, ‘putting rocks back where they’re supposed to be’, said Scottie, an Urban designer from Yale who’s been organizing Rainbow for decades, ’The location was strategically chosen to be far away from river sources to protect the local water’s ecosystem.’ Everyone was also informed to only use dead trees for campfire wood and structure building.\n\n## More Conclusions!\n\nIn the end I want to say that this post is not suggesting that if everyone becomes hippies and gather in the woods we would solve all world’s problems, nor that Rainbow is an absolute golden formula for DAOs to learn from.\n\nThe Rainbow Gathering is a formula that worked for decades, with a simple and beautiful message. It exists because it needs to exist and it will continue to exist as long as enough people make it happen, it will always be at the cross of the supply and demand curve, and the longer it goes, the more experienced it would be at decentralized autonomous gathering.\n\nAfter hearing many negative comments and press about Rainbow I was glad to experience it myself and make my own distinction. I’m eternally grateful that something simple and beautiful can be experienced with no barrier of entry, and see people take care of each other with so much generosity and unconditional love. I have restored some faith in humanity, and felt encouraged to pursuit what I’m called to do ---- using technology to serve the holistic well being of humans and create abundance for all. 🌈\n\n![Rainbow Gathering 2022, Main Circle](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xPa-dPjMhfUoe_xtWE0I5.jpg?height=602&width=1200)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658168570, "digest": "eU8IjkDPEbliTU96YyrlE0rW1nhMORS7cFjq-ZN3oMI", "contributor": "0x79A99912f8890DB72EEF59dd92Baa0935D133856"}

完美地融入了这种新的叙述，并且与从公共分布式账本到机器学习的不同领域相关。\n\n全同态加密是一种传说中的技术（至少在密码学界），它允许对加密数据进行任意计算。由于隐私是整个技术的主要关注点，完全同态加密 (FHE) 完全适合这种新的叙述。FHE 与公共分布式账本（如区块链）和机器学习相关。\n\n第一个 FHE 计划于 2009 年由 Craig Gentry 成功构建。从那时起，已经提出了许多 FHE 方案，并且在该领域没有缺乏相关工作。但是，对于为什么要完成所有这些工作或其中任何工作的动机，几乎没有解释。刚开始学习 FHE 时，我有很多疑问：为什么会有这么多方案？FHE 有实际用例吗？如果 FHE 像描述的那样强大，为什么它还没有起飞？\n\n我们将首先介绍 FHE 的工作原理以及它可能有用的一些领域。文章的重点在第 2 部分，我们在其中考虑了为什么FHE 尚未受到广泛关注以及这些问题的一些潜在解决方案。TL; DR 是目前使用 FHE 库时完全缺乏可用性。FHE 方案的所有内部工作原理和复杂性（其中有很多）都暴露给工程师。\n\n最后，如果您有兴趣亲自动手，我们将指向该领域的一些库。\n\n### 什么是全同态加密（FHE）？\n\n全同态加密是一种加密方案，允许您对加密数据执行任意\\*计算。\n\n* 不完全正确，但我们暂时将其排除在外\n\n### 公钥加密方案的复习\n\n让我们从加密方案的简要回顾开始。明文是明文数据（即未加密数据），而密文是加密数据。\n\n加密方案中的算法\n加密方案包括以下 3 种算法：\n\n**1**  KeyGen(...security_parameters)→ keys：密钥生成算法将一些安全参数作为其输入。然后它输出方案的密钥。\n\n**2** Encrypt(plaintext, key, randomness)→ ciphertext：加密算法将明文、密钥和一些随机性（加密必须是概率性的才能“安全”）作为输入。然后输出相应的密文（即加密数据）。\n\n**3** Decrypt(ciphertext, key)→ plaintext：解密算法将密文和密钥作为输入。它输出相应的明文。\n\n在私钥加密方案中，同样key用于加密和解密。这意味着任何可以加密明文（即明文数据）的人也可以解密密文（即加密数据）。这些类型的加密方案也被称为“对称”，因为加密/解密之间的关系是对称的。\n\n然而，在公钥加密方案中，不同的密钥用于加密和解密。个人可能能够加密数据，但无法解密相应的密文。这些类型的加密方案也被称为“非对称”，因为加密/解密之间的关系是非对称的。\n\n您之前可能听说过 [ElGamal 加密方案]() （它基于[Diffie-Hellman 密钥交换](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)）。这些方案通常在介绍性密码学课程中教授，并且（在大多数现代应用中）依赖于一种常用的密码学类型，称为[椭圆曲线密码学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)。\n\n### 那么“同态”部分是什么意思呢？\n\n我们将把重点转向同态（公钥）加密方案，因为它们是最有用的。“同态”部分意味着在明文空间（即所有有效的明文）与密文空间（即所有有效的密文）中执行计算之间存在特殊关系。\n\n具体来说，在“同态加密方案”中，以下关系成立：\n\n同态加法：Encrypt(a) + Encrypt(b) = Encrypt(a + b)\n同态乘法：Encrypt(a) \\* Encrypt(b) = Encrypt(a \\* b)\n允许您执行以下操作：\nEncrypt(3xy + x) = Encrypt(3xy) + Encrypt(x) = \\[3 \\* Encrypt(x) \\* Encrypt(y)\\] + Encrypt(x)\n\n所以只要知道Encrypt(x)和Encrypt(y)，我们就可以计算更复杂的多项式表达式的加密。\n\n### 它是如何工作的？直觉是什么？\n\n简称Encrypt(a)为a'。简称Encrypt(b)为b'。回想一下a'和b'是密文。\n\n每次我们执行同态操作时，我们都会在密文中添加额外的噪声。在某些时候，如果噪声太大，您将无法成功解密密文。你只是运气不好。对于同态加法，噪声不会增长得太厉害。您可以将噪声增长视为Noise(a' + b') = Noise(a') + Noise(b')。然而，问题在于执行同态乘法。在同态乘法中，噪声增长表现为Noise(a' \\* b') = Noise(a') \\* Noise(b')。\n\n让我们用一些数字来使这更具体。我们会说Noise(a')是 10。我们会说Noise(b')是 20。FHE 方案有一些噪声上限，在此之后我们无法解密密文，即使我们有解密密钥。对于我们的示例，假设噪声上限为 300。在两个密文之间执行一次同态加法后，噪声将为10 + 20 = 30。不错！a'但是，如果我们在和之间执行单个同态乘法b'，则生成的噪声将10 \\* 20 = 200针对密文a' \\* b'。如果我们然后尝试计算(a' \\* b') \\* (a')，对于 FHE 方案来说，噪声将太大！(a' \\* b') \\* (a')因此，即使我们有解密密钥（因为Noise(a' \\* b') \\* Noise(a') = 200 \\* 10 = 2000），我们也无法解密。\n\n正确设置方案的所有参数，在正确的时间执行“噪声控制”操作是您的工作（我们不会在本文中讨论这些操作是什么，因为它们可能因方案而异），并且尽量不要这样做许多同态乘法。这听起来让你感到害怕吗？那你的陪伴很好。\n\n注意：有一种方法可以绕过固定的噪声上限——“[自举](https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/easy-fhe.pdf)”——它具有自己的一套复杂性和权衡取舍。\n\n### 构建完全同态加密方案需要什么？\n\n所有 FHE 方案都使用一种特定类型的[后量子密码术](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography)，称为[格密码术](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography)。好消息是 FHE 可以抵抗来自量子计算机的攻击（如果我们应该关注这样的事情是完全不同的话题）。坏消息是，即使您以前参加过密码学入门课程，您也可能不熟悉格密码学。\n\n简单地说，晶格位于实向量空间（也称为 R^n）内，可以使用向量和矩阵表示（您绝对应该熟悉！）。\n\nFHE 方案可以根据它们对计算的建模方式分为 3 种类型（如果对更高级的技术细节感兴趣，请参阅[此演示文稿）。](http://homomorphicencryption.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CCS-HE-Tutorial-Slides.pdf)第一种类型将计算建模为**布尔电路**（即位）。第二种类型将计算建模为**模算术**（即“时钟”算术）。第三种也是最后一种将计算建模为**浮点运算**。\n\n**计算模型                                      适合                                                                                                   计划**\\*\n\nBoolean                             Number

Machine Learning              [CKKS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/421.pdf)\n\n这些方案的名称通常来自创建它的作者的姓氏。例如，“BGV”来自作者 Brakerski、Gentry 和 Vaikuntanathan。\n\n* 并非详尽的方案清单！我刚刚列出了一些知名的。\n\n### 为什么我们关心这个？\n\n公共分类账上的私人交易（例如区块链）。私人交易方案允许用户安全地将数字货币发送给某个接收者，而无需在公共分布式账本上透露发送给任何人（除了预期的接收者）的金额。这与比特币等加密货币形成鲜明对比，其中交易和余额都是公共信息。\n\n我们假设一个完全同态（公钥）加密方案。所有加密都是针对接收方的密钥完成的。\n\n1  发件人想要将t令牌发送给收件人。发送t者在接收者的公钥下加密。\n\n2  发件人Encrypt(t)在公共分类账上发布。\n\n3  请注意Encrypt(t) + Encrypt(Receiver's balance) = Encrypt(Receiver's balance after performing the transaction).\n\n这可以扩展到更有趣的金融应用，例如拍卖、投票和衍生品。将计算建模为模算术的 FHE 方案可能最适合此类应用。\n\n注意：要使其在实践中发挥作用，还需要一些其他加密工具（例如[零知识证明](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/27/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer/)）。。\n\n\\*\\*私人机器学习。\\*\\*在过去的几年里，人们越来越关注我们如何能够从数据中“学习”（通过机器学习），同时仍然保持数据本身的私密性。FHE 是一种可以帮助我们实现这一目标的工具。与之前的应用相比，我们可能需要一个 FHE 方案，将计算建模为*浮点运算*。\n\n该领域的一项著名工作是[Crypto-Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6181)，它结合了（顾名思义）FHE 和[神经网络](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)，以允许外包机器学习。当人们谈论“外包机器学习”时，通常描述的环境是数据*所有者*想要了解他的数据，但不愿意与提供机器学习模型的公司公开分享他的数据。因此，数据所有者使用 FHE 加密他的数据，并允许机器学习公司在加密数据集上运行他们的模型。\n\n同态加密并不是解决这个问题的唯一方法；[差分隐私](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy#:\\~:text=Differential%20privacy%20is%20a%20system,about%20individuals%20in%20the%20dataset)是一个密切相关的主题，在过去几年中引起了很多关注。差分隐私比密码学更多是统计数据，因为它不直接涉及加密/解密。它通过在清晰的数据中添加噪声来工作，同时仍然保证可以从嘈杂的数据集中获得有意义的见解。Apple 是一家[据称使用](https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Differential_Privacy_Overview.pdf)差异隐私来了解您的行为同时保持一定程度隐私的大公司。\n\n### 为什么 FHE 还没有起飞：太空中的挑战\n\n到目前为止，这一切听起来都很棒，但我一直忽略了一些问题。\n\n### 许多不同的方案（也就是每个人都说不同的语言）\n\n您已经决定要使用 FHE——太好了！以下是现在需要考虑的一些注意事项：\n\n**你想如何建模计算？**\n\nFHE 以三种方式之一对计算进行建模——布尔电路、模运算或浮点运算。[希望您需要哪种模型是显而易见的，因为除了像这样](http://homomorphicencryption.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CCS-HE-Tutorial-Slides.pdf)的介绍性资源之外没有多少资源可以帮助您。不过，这个问题可能是您最不关心的问题。\n\n如果我对属于我需要的相同计算模型的 FHE 方案有多个选项（例如，在 BGV 与 BFV 之间进行选择以进行模运算），该怎么办？\n\n嗯，很不幸。没有太多工作可以解释具有相同计算模型的不同方案之间的权衡。您可能必须使用各种方案并使用它们来实现您的特定用例以确定哪个是最好的。您可以尝试阅读一些非常复杂的研究论文（例如[this ）。](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/493.pdf)\n\n基于不同计算模型的方案是否表现相同？\n有点但不是真的。不同的方案倾向于使用不同的技术来控制效率和噪声增长，您需要了解这些技术才能成功使用 FHE。此外，这些方案具有您需要了解的不同参数才能正确设置它们。这些参数不仅影响方案的安全性（这是密码学中给定的），还影响您可以使用的明文种类、您可以执行的同态计算的数量以及方案的整体性能。\n\n不同的方案完全兼容吗？\n这张照片\\*有帮助吗？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HjXfRK6TJ_J0zmAORZkEM.png?height=589&width=1000&&&size=medium)\n\nFHE 之间存在的关系，但要了解这种关系，您还需要详细了解 FHE 的各种工作原理。\n\n有很多选择真是赞了！\n\n但在以下情况下并不好：\n\n您不知道 FHE 方案之间的这些不同或方案之间的关系，您必须真正从大量精力来理解一个单一的方案获得的一个方案，不能在多种不同的知识转移中并学习一个新方案计算模型下）\n\n### 潜在的解决方案：\n\n1. 更新和改进基准测试工作\n\n一个大问题是缺乏最新的基准测试工作。当我们不知道一个实现对另一个实现如何执行时（在同一台机器上，对于一组特定的可比参数），很难推荐针对特定用例使用哪种 FHE 方案。FHE 库变化很快，纳入了新的优化，因此 1-2 年前的基准测试工作很快就失去了相关性（例如2018 年[的](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/589.pdf)BFV 方案的各种实现）。\n\n2  更好的资源/指南来解释方案之间的权衡\n\n如果没有对不同方案和库的最新基准测试，就不可能提供好的资源来解释 FHE 方案在实践中的权衡。有一些演示文稿（例如[这个](http://homomorphicencryption.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CCS-HE-Tutorial-Slides.pdf)）试图阐明 FHE 中 3 种计算模型之间的差异。但是，如果您尝试使用*相同*的计算模型在*不同的方案之间进行选择，那么没有任何好的资源可以提供帮助。*\n\n3能够在不同 FHE 方案之间移动（即互操作性）\n\n如果不同的 FHE 方案之间存在某种互操作性，则更容易理解这些方案是如何相互关联的。关于这个主题的学术著作是[CHIMERA](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/758)，它提供了在 TFHE（布尔）、BFV（模运算）和 HEAAN（浮点运算）之间切换的框架。不幸的是，这项工作需要非常强大的抽象代数背景以及对所使用的所有 FHE 方案的熟悉程度。解释不同类型方案之间关系的更易于访问的资源会很好（“类型”是指 3 种类型的计算模型——布尔、模算术、浮点算术）。\n\n* 图片来自[CHIMERA](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/758)的论文\n\n### 效率（比看起来与更复杂的问题）\n\n如果您大部分是 FHE 的人“并询问他们为什么不使用 FHE，他们通常会说哦，它可以解决不高”之类的事情。换而言之，我觉得每个人都似乎有点懒惰，它大大增加了个人的助益问题。因为它使用了加密的私人密码，这并不意味着人都可以真正有效地加密。情况下，应该使用较低的技术。\n\n除了个人的声音之外，我们将您必须考虑的一些因素，以提高 FHE 的观察效果。\n\n一些 FHE 允许您对加密执行真正的任意数量的计算。但是，许多方案允许一定的同态执行数量。执行后，不能保证会成功执行。因此，FHE方案只允许 100 次同态乘法（注意：加法在 FHE 方案中“容易”，而得到乘法要困难立即）。通常如果我们试行进行第 101 次同态乘法，则不能保证的密文可以同样是允许真正的各种方案的多种性能计算出你的性能差的表现。\n\n你需要多少明文空间？大不同。如果您用密文表示账户余额并且需要确保他们不会“环绕”模数，这可能特别重要。\n\n\\*\\*您是否要对许多不同的明文或密文（即“SIMD”样式计算）执行相同的操作？\\*\\*一些 FHE 方案可以利用“ [SIMD](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/133.pdf) ”风格的操作同时对多个明文或密文执行相同的操作。如果这种并行化对您有用，您应该考虑探索提供此功能的方案和库。SIMD 风格的操作，如果使用得当，确实可以提高效率。\n\n\\*\\*您可以接受哪些密钥大小？\\*\\*例如，使用[TFHE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/421.pdf)，您需要在方案中访问的某些密钥可能是 1 GB 大！就时间而言，性能可能不错，但您却需要存储一把巨大的钥匙。\n\n\\*\\*你对大密文没问题吗？\\*\\*使用 FHE 时，密文扩展可能非常糟糕。再次查看[TFHE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/421.pdf)，明文到密文的扩展为 10,000:1，这是可接受的安全级别（100 位）。\n\n在性能方面对您来说最重要的是什么？您不能在 FHE 中“可能拥有一切”，因此确定您需要什么想要什么计算。可能你需要一个很大的明文空间。在选择 FHE 方案的时候，需要考虑所有这些小问题。\n\n**潜在的解决方案：**\n\n1\\.硬件加速\n\n一些 FHE 方案可以使用[GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit)进行加速；此类库的示例包括[nuFHE](https://github.com/nucypher/nufhe)和[cuFHE](https://github.com/vernamlab/cuHE)。加速 FHE 方案的其他努力包括使用[FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array)（例如[HEAX](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09731.pdf)）。[HEAX](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09731.pdf)与 CKKS 方案（浮点算法）配合使用，可以根据具体操作产生 12 倍到 250 倍以上的性能加速。不幸的是，该论文表明基于 FPGA 的方法对于 BFV 方案（整数算术）并不那么成功。\n\n*2.改进FHE方案的研究突破*\n\n说起来容易做起来难。\n\n### 可用性（没有）\n\n前面的讨论将我们引向了最后一点——可用性。FHE*对*初学者不友好，*对*用户不友好，*当然也*对密码学家不友好。对于缺乏数学或密码学背景的工程师来说，确实没有任何可用性。\n\n大多数 FHE 库都需要深入了解底层加密方案才能正确有效地使用。另一位密码学家将使用 FHE 描述为类似于编写程序集——好的实现和出色的实现在性能上存在巨大差异。如果没有强大的底层方案背景，涉足诸如[HElib之类的库可能会令人生畏。](https://github.com/homenc/HElib)\n\n***情况真的那么糟糕吗？***\n\n将我们简要介绍使 FHE 异常用户友好的问题。\n\n* 参数设置很重要。例如，在[BFV](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/blob/master/native/examples/1_bfv_basics.cpp)（比 BGV 方案更简单）中，我们必须设置多项式模数、系数模数和明文模数。设置这些参数需要了解它们如何影响方案（例如，您计划进行哪种操作，多少操作）。此外，要了解参数的含义，您必须学习一些关于[环](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics))的基本理论（抽象代数）。我们目前无法抽象出这些问题；这只是使用 FHE 方案所必需的。\n* 公钥加密只有 3 种主要算法（`KeyGen`, `Encrypt`, `Decrypt`），但对于具有附加操作的 FHE 方案来说并不那么简单（方案之间也有所不同）。因为您需要了解*如何*以及*何时*使用某些操作，所以使用 FHE 需要您自己培养直觉。\n* 为了培养良好的直觉，您需要使用该方案....但是有些库的文档很少。\n* 理解一种类型的方案可能无法很好地转化为理解另一种类型的方案（这里按类型，我指的是三种不同的计算模型）。\n\n  > *那么……我现在准备好使用 FHE 了吗？*\n\n  可能不会，但您肯定已经准备好查看一些库了！\n\n潜在的解决方案：\n\n1. 标准化工作\n\n   在这里，我们的意思是明确使用哪些参数、提供哪些功能等的标准。\n\n   标准化工作目前由开放的行业/政府/学术联盟“同态加密标准化”牵头。他们已经发布了关于同态加密的安全性和 API 标准的提案草案。\n2. 更人性化的库和示例\n\n   一个例子是Microsoft 的 SEAL，它有一个非常有指导意义的示例部分。希望更多的库会花时间创建用户友好的文档和示例。\n3. 潜在的编译器\n\n   FHE 社区中关于创建编译器或一些中间表示以使 FHE 更易于使用的讨论已经有一段时间了。[Cingulata](https://github.com/CEA-LIST/Cingulata)就是这样一种尝试。不幸的是，这些编译器中的许多都会显着降低速度（与直接使用 FHE 库相比）。。\n\n## 这一切有什么意义？\n\n> ***不是你，是FHE。***\n\n高级编程语言已经抽象出多种计算机工作方式的复杂性，在使用时，没有“高级语言”的类似物性。 FHE 对目前并没有很好的使用效果，FHE 还准备好在制作过程中使用非密码制作制作。\n\n非常看好别人 FHE 的未来。，但是现在，需要指出 FHE 的功效（给定图书馆和使我定的）更有用的地方。\n\n给我看代码！如果以前没有使用 FHE 的经验，我们建议您从您的用户更友好的库开始，SEAL。\n\n一些例如 SEAL 和 PALI 提供了各种类型的 HE 方案。\n\n**计算模型可用库**\n\n```\n        Boolean                                      [TFHE](https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe), [nuFHE](https://github.com/nucypher/nufhe),

In a mail sent to its customers on Thursday the company voluntarily filed petitions for Chapter 11 reorganization and used the same firm as Voyager Digital for its bankruptcy proceedings. It is unclear what will happen with users’ funds at this stage, given there may be a [$1.2 billion hole in the firm’s balance sheet](https://cointelegraph.com/news/celsius-bankruptcy-filings-show-a-company-in-deep-trouble). Earlier in the day, Celsius closed off the last of its Defi debts owed to Compound, Aave and Maker, reducing its initial debt of $820 million to just $0.013 over the course of a month. What is still unknown, however, will be the fate of depositors who still have their assets locked up on the lending platform. Neither the company nor its CEO Alex Mashinsky has made any public comments about whether depositors will receive any percentage of their funds back.\n\n[![Image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe063d75e-b651-4992-92d5-71011e3587a4\\_1723x965.jpeg \"Image\")](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe063d75e-b651-4992-92d5-71011e3587a4\\_1723x965.jpeg)\n\n## 3AC founder breaks month long silence, plays victim card.\n\nSu Zhu, co-founder of Singapore-based crypto venture capital firm Three Arrows Capital (3AC), returned to Twitter after nearly a month of inactivity.

In this recap we share the opportunities and challenges in bringing innovative governance models to offline communities.**\n\nCity3’s mission is to create more just socio-economic systems powered by crypto for existing real world communities. As part of this effort, we recently partnered with [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) to bring quadratic funding to the city of Oakland.\n\n[Quadratic funding](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000) (QF) is a mathematically and democratically optimal way to fund public goods, where matching capital is distributed based on a quadratic formula that makes the number of contributors matter more than the amount raised.\n\n![Quadratic funding explained (EOS)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8CJudW5yeHroHo9FiCaH2.png?height=415&width=768)\n\nWe originally set out with three broad questions outlined in our [announcement](https://mirror.xyz/0xcity3.eth/8ZgDDZcixWbLW9Jb79Vuc5illbB5IiKU-c-NyCfabEQ):\n\n* Is supporting an organization that you care about an effective incentive for someone to set up a web3 wallet?\n* What can quadratic funding tell us about the way people value civic organizations?\n* Will small dollar contributors feel they’ve made a significant contribution?\n\nIn this article we highlight two major takeaways from the experience:\n\n1. **To optimize positive results, we should identify the types of decisions and/or public goods that thrive when QF is applied.** We recommend a stronger alignment with the two problems QF is designed to address: information asymmetry and the free rider problem.\n2. **Governance experiments need to prioritize building trust, accessibility and diverse representation.** Funding real-world public goods comes with its own set of challenges, but existing tools are not designed for offline communities. This is an open call for more QF projects “in the wild”.\n\n# Overview and results\n\nDuring [Gitcoin Grants Round 14](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gr14-results/) which ran from 8-23 June 2022, 7 Oakland nonprofits raised $3,799.07 from 454 contributions and 249 unique contributors. $15,000 has been set aside for matching, funded jointly by city3 and the [Oakland Fund for Public Innovation](https://www.oaklandfund.org/).\n\n![Gitcoin’s quadratic funding local cause round for Oakland](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eh6o2W2RW1rMLSWhG70zd.png?height=1488&width=1830)\n\nAlthough contributing to the round was open to anyone, we hosted a series of virtual governance workshops aimed at assisting locals with setting up a non-custodial crypto wallet and Github account, and then navigating Gitcoin’s checkout process.\n\nDuring these workshops we saw firsthand how most web3 tools are simply not designed for offline communities, let alone mobile-first users.\n\nYet despite the friction, several residents expressed surprise that crypto could be used in this way. For those interacting with crypto for the first time, there was something viscerally meaningful about seeing a $5 donation get matched with $30 for an organization in their community. Those already familiar with crypto expressed a desire to see more of these initiatives:\n\n> *“I am currently working full time for a DAO, and it's cool how global it is, but would love to get more involved \\[with\\] local web3/crypto efforts.”*\n\nExact numbers on local participation are not available, but by combining Gitcoin’s profile location data with the number of people who attended our governance workshops and/or responded to our feedback surveys, we estimate that 20% of contributors were Oakland residents.\n\nClearly, there exists some critical threshold at which representation either justifies or undermines the entire quadratic funding process. This also highlights why education and accessibility are so important, and ought to be considered integral to any effective quadratic funding program.\n\nConsider a hypothetical grants round with higher-stakes decisions. While outside funding might still be useful to maximize funds raised, would we still weigh votes equally between locals and non-locals? We’re excited about the early although untested solutions that attempt to solve this, such as intersectional social data (see [RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/2019-10-24-uh78r5/)) or geo-spatial weighting (see [Astral Protocol](https://docs.astral.global/) or [Foam](https://foam.space/)).\n\n# Where does quadratic funding matter most?\n\nIn their 2020 paper, *[Building Radical Cities](https://assets.website-files.com/5d253237e31f051057dc0a2b/5f04beb70336ec0cc37ceff9_Building%20Radical%20Charter%20Cities.pdf)*, Paul Healy and Matt Prewitt identify QF as one of several mechanisms to better calibrate political expression at the city level. QF has been a popular choice for distributing public grants in the cryptosphere. For example, Gitcoin Grants Round 14 saw record breaking numbers: over 44,000 contributors donated $1.7M which will be boosted by a $3.2M matching pool.\n\nJust as QF supports “long tail” crypto projects – novel, small initiatives that otherwise would not be able to accumulate startup capital – we set out to test whether the same could be applied to long tail “real-world” projects, particularly civic organizations that play a critical role in serving their communities. While several offline projects have raised funds with Gitcoin in the past, this was the first time matching was targeted at a specific geographic community.\n\nWe are incredibly proud to have worked with Oakland nonprofits doing important work ranging from tech mentorship to supporting gang-impacted youth. And while we believe that nothing bad happens when impactful community organizations get money they deserve, in hindsight we do question whether funding local nonprofits was the most useful application of this governance tool.\n\nThe benefit of QF lies not so much in matching large sums of capital to small donations as in surfacing the nuance of community preferences in order to produce the best possible allocation outcome for decisions involving competing public goods.\n\nHere we turn to the two problems QF is most cited to solve:\n\n1. **QF solves an information problem.** In a world of scarce resources, the government (or more broadly, the public) does not always know how much of a certain good to provide\n2. **QF solves a free rider problem.** Those who benefit from public goods often underpay or don’t pay at all because there is little incentive to make small, individual contributions.\n\nWe believe we could have done a better job of scoping the problem space and designing our QF program to directly address these areas. For our next experiment, we may consider these questions as part of our decision making framework:\n\n1. What are some examples of competing public goods that we find difficult to prioritize in the local city budget?\n2. What are some areas of public resource allocation that people frequently complain feels unrepresentative and/or unfair?\n3. What are some alternative governance models already being applied in the community (e.g. participatory budgeting, neighborhood council advisory boards) – are they willing to try a new approach?\n\n# A call for more quadratic funding “in the wild”\n\nSome of our biggest coordination challenges exist at the city level. While there is growing interest in new governance models enabled by web3 technology, we haven’t seen these implemented outside of [a few examples](https://twitter.com/0xcity3/status/1534576283232763905). In other words, whether quadratic funding is indeed democratically and economically optimal is yet to be tested at scale.\n\nWe see a massive opportunity to combine the best of tokenized governance with decisions that tangibly affect the communities we live in. Several organizations are already doing work that makes this possible:\n\n* [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)\n* [Endaoment](https://endaoment.org/)\n* [Change](https://getchange.io/)\n* [RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/)\n* [Clr.fund](https://clr.fund/#/)\n* [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/)\n\nWe hope to see more crypto tools designed to serve real-world communities. For this to happen, we simultaneously need to invest in [pre-existing social infrastructure](https://otherinter.net/research/local-gov/) that has a long legacy of making our cities more just, more livable and more resilient.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe believe that QF is only as impactful as it is accessible and only as useful as it solves critical problems that could not be solved through simpler means.\n\nThe Oakland local cause round was the first of many programs city3 will be launching to bridge web3 innovation with real-world community needs. Just as crypto crowdfunding has expanded possibilities for seeding public goods, we have a unique opportunity to shift resource allocation within our cities.\n\n[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xcity3) to stay up to date with our work.", "timestamp": 1658170166, "digest": "3mWS8yQnErrG60crGKTl3pKb6Xe46WCPTIaq9V9xvvw", "contributor": "0x27F2a7D8ce449C9A1E35Fc859Aa0d1053f5E47D3"}

{"id": "zkb0UM21EqHsrvx3mnQJmwMLKRhCjmVbDmPabwSxKDc", "title": "What DAOs Can Learn from Rainbow — 50yrs of Decentralized Autonomous Gathering", "body": "## The Immense Potential of DAOs\n\nFor an in-depth yet beginner friendly introduction to DAOs, please check out [this NYTimes article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/what-are-daos.html).\n\nHistorically, centralized power seemed to have obviously ‘won’ against the decentralized crowd —— we have witnessed how local faiths overpowered by organized religions, co-ops outcompeted by conglomerates, indigenous tribes eliminated by empires. We live in a world where profit incentives aren’t aligned with the common wealth and resources are shamefully extracted to maximize profit for individual gains.\n\nWithout doubt, technologies are best used to serve humanity’s overall well-being. Blockchain solutions can be used to realign our incentives, create equitable and transparent systems to avoid corruption and exploitation. The DAO space has huge potential to create **community-oriented autonomous templates to fundamentally decentralize the way humans operate** in order to **create abundance for all.**\n\n![Homemade meme about DAOs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TrgE2iuoFa1Fvi7OIiyOx.png?height=1011&width=1166)\n\nWithin a system that is transparent and fair, people would operate better because they ‘can’t do bad’ instead of ‘won’t do bad’. The Gitcoin’s theory on [ImpactDAOs](https://store.gitcoin.co/products/impactdao-book-digital-edition) did a deep dive into this philosophy.\n\nIt is worth noting that DAOs are still in its infancy, most DAOs are in its process of figuring out the best suited ways to govern. Many DAOs have very long and redundant execution processes as a protection against centralized dictatorship which often led to inefficiency and bureaucracy. Being born at the heart of the crypto industry, DAOs can be filled with pyramid scams and inflated values.\n\nBecause of the immaturity and capital-infested nature of crypto, learnings on the art of gathering and coordination may best come from outside of the DAO space. Humans have been organizing in swift and ingenue ways centuries before blockchain technology appeared.\n\nDAOs are schelling points for strangers to gather around a shared mission & vision and collectively accumulate resources to achieve this shared goal. —— This is exactly what [Rainbow Gathering](https://rainbowfamilygatherings.net/) has achieved in the past 50 years without blockchain.\n\n## What is the Rainbow Gathering?\n\n![Pic from SDBP Radio](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NHzQChJZjYJaW7Pb2-dou.png?height=542&width=880)\n\n*Special Thanks to [@mycobici](https://twitter.com/mycobici) for encouraging me to go to the 50 years Rainbow Gathering and drawing the analogy between Rainbow and DAOs. Special Thanks to [@imu](https://www.instagram.com/zenthebus/) for sending me courage, love and the Rainbow Gathering coordinate. 💕*\n\nI heard about the rainbow gathering from an off-grid eco village at the southern tip of Hilo, Hawaii.\n\n“It’s a gathering about peace, love and generosity. It is completely free to go and everything was shared in a gift-based society”, said someone from the eco village, who at the time refuses to have a cellphone or wear shoes.\n\n“There is no tickets, no social media. Location changes every year mostly in different national forests and the only way to find out is through word of mouth.\n\nThe gatherings also happen all around the world. Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Costa Rica, Mexico… and here on the Big Island! The main gathering is in the US every year, the main international gathering rotates around the world, and there are regionals happening all the time.”\n\nRainbow Gathering started in 1972, it is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Gathering) as a gathering where people ‘congregate in remote forests around the world for one or more weeks at a time with the stated intention of living a shared ideology of peace, harmony, freedom, and respect.’\n\nThe first gathering happened in Colorado where twenty thousand people faced police roadblocks, threatened [civil disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience), and were allowed onto [National Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Forest) land. It has spontaneously become a yearly tradition ever since.\n\nIn this anti-capitalist and anti-materialist world, people put up temporary cabins and tents, campfires and water filters, shared everything in a mutually respectful way. Regardless of cultural background or race, people shared a common language that is peace and love.\n\n![Pic of Rainbow from Sky-Hi News](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z2Savl-0dyYT_81p5EB0F.png?height=637&width=1024)\n\nIt is worth iterating that there are natural problems that come with the gathering, I do not wish to say that everything happens with the Rainbow community is always positive. The concerns about Rainbow Gathering will be claimed in the section in the end.\n\n## How Decentralized?\n\nThe gathering has no single leader, no corporation and usually no money involved except for some donations. All organizers gather and find common grounds cooperatively. Anyone that felt the urge to contribute can volunteer to organize since helping hands are always needed.\n\nAt each gathering, organizers would arrive weeks in advance to pave roads, study the terrain and plan out the locations. Different kitchen crews would put up camps with cookware, shelves, washing stations, toilet holes and sometimes showers. Individuals usually gather around the kitchens, enjoy the meals and help out when they can.\n\n![Reverse Osmosis Connected to River Water](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/By8WYji7f2M2sDBxgsCII.jpg?height=716&width=1000)\n\nEach camp has its own culture and quite unique characteristics. In the 50yr’s gathering in Colorado, **Instant Soup** served vegan soup 24/7 and always had elderly folks singing around campfire every night. **Wanna Burn** was a kitchen organized by nomad performers and fire spinners and they just felt like lovely pirates. I was told by the crew if anyone took out a cellphone at the kitchen it would get smashed. **Kids Village** as the name suggested were a fun space for kids to run around with small bridges and swings.\n\n![Pic from Atlas Obscura](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kqlMdmqaYgMyuQv4guELZ.png?height=2474&width=3235)\n\nEach kitchen dug its ‘compost’ holes for organic matters and buried them after they’re full. ‘Shitters’ were dug at various locations and ashes and dirt were put on them to avoid flies and diseases. All non-organic trash were carried out by volunteers as people started to leave. Crates from recycle companies were placed at the entrance of the gathering.\n\nAt the center you can find **Info Camp** where all info and activities can be found on bulletin boards, medical tents where student volunteers treated the sick and injured.\n\n![Map about the 2022 Gathering in Colorado](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z-ids5g5ZGXDsci0ACZ1q.png?height=1097&width=843)\n\nDuring the gathering, various events were celebrated and projects were made. On July 4th, everyone gathered in the main lawn and prayed in silence for world peace. People put together sweat lodges, had meetings about permaculture and eco villages. There was yoga and Tai-chi practices, poetry nights, music circles, fire dancing… Basically, if enough people want to make something happen, it would happen.\n\n## Unanimous Consensus\n\n![Rainbow Family Pic from Wikipedia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PWXQIX4NRhW0hSyHjU62x.jpg?height=900&width=1200)\n\nThe most important decision every gathering is where to have Rainbow next year. This decision is made by the ‘Vision Circle’ which is usually held at the end of each gathering. Anyone who shows up at the Vision Circle would may speak and hold voting power regardless of their expertise. Unanimous consensus is required for any decisions to be made, the Vision Circle sometimes take days to complete in order to reach consensus.\n\nI sat at the Vision Circle for hours just to observe the process, it reminds me of filibustering in politics. Although the difference is that anyone who wanted to speak can speak, and there is absolutely no interruption to anyone’s speech.\n\nMajority of people do not feel the need to participate in this decision making process. Since the location rotates every year across the US, it seems like a natural flow of evenly distributed choices.\n\nI do believe Vision Circle exists more for the spirit of making sure everyone’s voice is heard. **The nature of unanimous consensus symbolizes that individual satisfaction is less important than group cohesion and harmony, which in itself is a quite beautiful spirit for any organization.** There will always be someone dissatisfied in the end, but everyone still celebrates when a decision was made.\n\n## How Autonomous?\n\nThe idea of Rainbow got brought to different corners of the world by people attended the first few gatherings. It has shown that decentralized social movements can be ‘templatized’. Once the formula has been play-tested, it can be ‘forked’ to different places and adopted to its local culture.\n\n**The formula is intuitive and the message is simple and powerful.**\n\nJust like how [Maslow summarized universal structure of basic human needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html#:\\~:text=From%20the%20bottom%20of%20the,attend%20to%20needs%20higher%20up.), Rainbow summarized universal solutions about gathering in the forest.\n\nBasic survival practices such as: choosing location with the right climate and source of water, setting up kitchen with chopped wood, preparing filters for river water, digging ‘shitters’ and burying feces with ashes and soil so diseases don’t spread, having event calendar visible in central info station, having safe words and other codes of conducts… All these formula are simple enough to be put into a handbook that can be carried cross boarder and language and learned quite intuitively, most of them might already be known by experienced outdoor survivors.\n\nJust a good formula is not enough without a strong motivation to gather of course. Getting a group of unmotivated people to do things is harder than making pigs fly. For Rainbow, the motive to gather comes is simple and powerful, it is that **everybody is welcome in this gift-based society of love and peace** —— a message quite hard to say no to.\n\nAs long as people feel the need to gather, people would find ways to do so. The gathering is very much an organic and natural formation. Nothing is forced, nothing is paid for, nothing is for show, nothing is for sale. People gathered and united around a common mission in a completely authentic and compassionate way.\n\nJust like how songs and stories spread across continents way before the birth of telegraph or internet, just like a good meme, penetrating through firewalls and cultural differences, whenever an art form or a message resonates with people deeply and fundamentally, it will flow effortlessly for as far as it can.\n\n## The Giving Culture as a Schelling Point\n\nMany would say Rainbow is a counter culture movement, it is everything ‘default society’ is not. The Rainbow culture is simple enough to spread far across cultures and borders, yet profound enough to create amazing impact on individuals.\n\nIt’s quite fascinating to have hiked miles into deep forest to be offered massages and served organic vegan soup for as many times as you want, none of which cost anything.\n\nWe talk about ‘flipping the game theory’ and ‘incentive alignment’ a lot in the DAO space, and the folks at Rainbow did it in such a simple way ---- a demographic that supposedly has little wealth proved that achieving abundance with very little is possible. It really does make you rethink about post scarcity differently. Even thou it might not be long term sustainable and comes with its own set of problems, there are still things we can learn from.\n\nParadigm shift need to come from mental shift, or as the new age hippies would call it: a consciousness shift. I do believe that with any emerging communication or governance technology, **the cultural spirit would be at the center of any social movement.** There would be no social change without a mentality shift free of existing construct of exploitations and unhealthy competitions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nJust like a knife can be used to cut butter or to kill people, the technology can be misused if it wasn’t intentional. Just because DAOs share the same technology doesn’t mean they share the same principle of operations. DAOs can be ‘central banks’, they can be outright valueless scams, or continued exploitations with cycles of pump and dump.\n\n**We aim to create systems where people ‘can’t act bad’, but it’s also crucial to create a culture where people ‘don’t want to act bad’. These two aspects, the spirit and the form, should be treated with equal importance in order to co-create something beautiful. That’s when DAOs meet Rainbow.**\n\nDAOs are by nature community oriented, and the community would seed the culture of the DAO. I believe [DAOs have potential to change how we coordinate and operate in many ways](https://blog.aragon.org/10-industries-being-disrupted-by-daos/), with a precondition that their shared mission is **simple and clearly defined, with authentic passion adhering to one’s intrinsic value**, and hopefully, oriented towards creating better future for all living beings. ❤️\n\n## Disclaimer —— Warnings About Rainbow ⚠️\n\nWithout over glorifying Rainbow, it’s important to mention the negative aspects of its culture.\n\nBecause everyone is welcomed, there is no guarantee that everybody at the gathering will behave in a mutually respectful way. Because it is free, there is a natural influx of people who live on the streets without homes. Because of its emphasis on personal freedom, there is always an abundance of illegal drugs.\n\nBecause of the anti-capitalistic mentality as its spirit, many people choose to be **anti-productivity** as well. Lots of people choose not to work or do anything constructive, and it became a gateway to indulgence in hedonism and anti-accomplishment mentality. The press and rumors about Rainbow are also mostly negative for all these reasons.\n\n**Here’s my observation at the gathering:**\n\nGoing to the gathering by myself for the first time, I was unsure of what to expect and was on high alert, very soon I relaxed and felt right at home. I’ve had many fun conversations with various characters of all ages and cultural backgrounds, gypsy flow artists from Europe, qi-gong masters from China, energy healers from Israel, farmers from Iowa, intentional village organizers from Tennessee, nomads from Bosnia, musicians from Turkey… It was a fun and diverse group of people, I felt accepted, respected and most of the time enjoyed everyone’s company.\n\nThere was an abundance of psychedelic drugs and weed being shared at the gathering. Most of them given out for free to people who ask for them. Occasionally you would see people tripping hard and acting ‘over the top’, however, comparing to a regular music festival, I would say it actually has a lot less of non-sober people — which was a total surprise for me.\n\nRainbow was a lot more family oriented compare to regular music festivals. There were many kids and elderly, many people I met brought their parents. Preparing and sharing group meals and singing in music circles were the majority of the activities. I would personally bring my parents to a Rainbow Gathering but probably not Burning Man.\n\nThe only ‘iffy thing’ that I observed was when someone looked like in high adrenaline said another ‘crazy’ person was trying to attack him and he dodged away. It did remind me that this was an event that everyone is welcome and everything is allowed so we do have to be cautious.\n\nAlthough it might be inevitable to have zero trash and disturbance to the environment given the scale of the gathering, I do think the organizers and volunteers did their best to protect local environment, they would spend weeks cleaning up everything after everyone leaves, ‘putting rocks back where they’re supposed to be’, said Scottie, an Urban designer from Yale who’s been organizing Rainbow for decades, ’The location was strategically chosen to be far away from river sources to protect the local water’s ecosystem.’ Everyone was also informed to only use dead trees for campfire wood and structure building.\n\n## More Conclusions!\n\nIn the end I want to say that this post is not suggesting that if everyone becomes hippies and gather in the woods we would solve all world’s problems, nor that Rainbow is an absolute golden formula for DAOs to learn from.\n\nThe Rainbow Gathering is a formula that worked for decades, with a simple and beautiful message. It exists because it needs to exist and it will continue to exist as long as enough people make it happen, it will always be at the cross of the supply and demand curve, and the longer it goes, the more experienced it would be at decentralized autonomous gathering.\n\nAfter hearing many negative comments and press about Rainbow I was glad to experience it myself and make my own distinction. I’m eternally grateful that something simple and beautiful can be experienced with no barrier of entry, and see people take care of each other with so much generosity and unconditional love. I have restored some faith in humanity, and felt encouraged to pursuit what I’m called to do ---- using technology to serve the holistic well being of humans and create abundance for all. 🌈\n\n![Rainbow Gathering 2022, Main Circle](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xPa-dPjMhfUoe_xtWE0I5.jpg?height=602&width=1200)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658170667, "digest": "o62XoLqkCWxs0T0n9c4hWwlyBJnaQcfFfTVg4QqCJt0", "contributor": "0x79A99912f8890DB72EEF59dd92Baa0935D133856"}

For example, three Arrows Captial (3AC) worth $2.8B was liquidated, and co-founders ran away while filing a lawsuit to against their own company. But this will only be the tip of the iceberg for the crypto industry at large. On one side are those who see opportunity in cryptocurrency; on the other are those intent on destroying it. I will share some changes that will affect the blockchain and cryptocurrency in general as a result of December’s massive purchase in virtual assets by a third-party organization known as “Crypto VC”.\n\n[https://twitter.com/DrSoldmanGachs/status/1547173025673785346](https://twitter.com/DrSoldmanGachs/status/1547173025673785346)\n\n**December’s massive purchase in virtual assets by a third party organization known as “Crypto VC”**\nCrypto VC isn't a new concept. Back in December 2017, there were VCs were blow up ever since.\n\nFor the first time in history, a public person has bought and sold virtual assets in person. This is amounting to the largest private sale of virtual assets to date. This transaction, which took place in New York City on December 3rd, marks a new milestone in the history of digital assets. The total investment amount involved in this deal is believed to be in the range of $200 million – $300 million. The motivation for this investment can be found in the style of the investments made: most notably, efforts by the investors to clean up their act.\n\n**Davan Megawal and the crypto VC scam**\nBack in May, One97 Capital – the investment vehicle of digital assets manager and investor Davan Megawal – bought complete control of IcoAward, a cryptocurrency fund focused on issuing digital currency. But this is just one incident in a long list of misdirection, misdirection, and misdirection by the fund management. While the bought-and-then-sold-on activities of Megawal and the fund managers are not covered in the facts about the purchase of IcoAward, the activities of the distributed ledger technology (DLT) startup Alexa, which was the core of the deal, are.\n\n**The Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Scams of 2017**\nBlockchain and cryptocurrency are inextricably linked. The first is a technology behind a wide range of industries – financial services, media, tech, insurance, etc. The second is a new and emerging branch of information technology that can support these technologies. The blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and public digital ledger that can record transactions efficiently and securely. The distributed ledger technologies – MLS, PPC, and SPV – are the latest in a long line of techniques that have been developed to support this new technology.\n\n**How to Protect Yourself From VC Investments**\nThere are a few things that you can do to protect yourself from potential conflicts of interest in investments. Some people are going to benefit from investing in companies that have ties to certain developers and investors in the blockchain and cryptocurrency fields. A good example is Facebook’s relationship with Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Bitcoin Foundation, which has been a prominent voice in calling for an end to the digital gold standard. But when Andreea Barys, a former employee at Facebook, became involved in the development of the DAO, a project that was closely associated with Buterin and other prominent blockchain and cryptocurrency developers, she became a prime example of potential conflict of interest.\n\n**What is a Crypto VC Investment?**\nA third party makes a crypto VC investment in exchange for funding the development of a new technology. There are several types of investments that can be made with cryptocurrencies – some are made as a investment and some are made as a reward for investing. What makes a crypto-VC investment different from other forms of funding is that it’s made by a third party. This is also the reason that you should carefully evaluate every investment opportunity with a view to eliminating any potential conflicts of interest.\n\n**Can’t beat luck in investing? Here’s how**\nA few things can prevent you from being a victim of the largest crypto-VC investment scam on record. Read on to learn about some of the most significant changes that will affect the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry in general as a result of the massive investment in virtual assets by a third party organization known as “Crypto VC”. Be sure to keep these major issues in mind when evaluating investments:\n\n* Is this investment for the right person?\n* Is this investment worthwhile for the right reasons?\n* Is the investment appropriate for my personal finances?\n\n**Summary**\nA variety of changes will affect the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries in general due to the purchase of cryptocurrency by a third party. The most significant change will be the creation of a dedicated regulatory authority – known as a “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” (DAO”) – to manage and regulate the new industry. Additionally, the introduction of a new “blockchain-based” technology called the “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” (Dao) will allow the industry to shift away from a centralized system and into a newer and more agile model. To make sure that you’re on the right track with your investment decision, stay current by following these steps: -evaluate the pros and cons of every investment opportunity with a view to eliminating any potential conflicts of interest.\n\nKeep in mind that each investment opportunity is different and that this is only the tip of the iceberg. You can protect yourself from potential conflicts of interest by following these steps:\n\n* Establish clear and consistent investment goals.\n* Only invest in companies that have a clear investment objective.\n* Don’t invest in companies that have any connection to illegal or unethical activities.\n* Don’t invest with funds that you’re not completely sure about.\n\n*Buy me a coffee [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/xuanling1111) if you want to support my writing.[Towfiqu barbhuiya](https://unsplash.com/@towfiqu999999?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/bankruptcy?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*", "timestamp": 1658172139, "digest": "HsMzIi6a8dhbcmFYt_GoXsXzIHF8o-WeviVgsYiv8Vs", "contributor": "0x87D5032831E5C092c87eb879e5108da7D58f9192"}

On July 30th, 2021, four unique Coca-Cola NFTs were up for auction as a single ‘loot box’, for sale on Opensea.io. All proceeds for the sale went to Special Olympics International, a longtime partner of Coca-Cola. Auctioned as one lot, the collection features multi-sensory NFTs housed inside a ‘Friendship Box’. Coca-Cola’s Josh Schwarber explains, “The metaverse—which is borderless and ‘geo-less’—creates opportunities to connect with others like never before. We didn’t want to do this just to make an NFT. We wanted to inject the core principles of Coca-Cola and celebrate both our heritage and ties to friendship, while also doing something that hasn’t been done before.”\n\nThe Friendship Box acts as a dynamic loot box that contains the following:\n\n* Physical: The winning bidder received a real-life SMEG FAB28 Coca-Cola fridge, stocked with ice-cold Coke.\n* Digital: A custom-designed Coca-Cola Bubble jacket wearable, which included an unlockable version that can be worn in Decentraland. A Sound Visualizer NFT included the ‘unmistakable fizz of a Coke’ complete with visual effects. Lastly, ‘The Friendship Card’ refreshes 1948 artwork used in a set of Coca-Cola trading cards from the 1990s symbolizing friendship and refreshment. The metaverse-influenced iteration of the cards add motion, light and 3D features.\n\n**Coca-Cola Snow Globes:** Coca-Cola partnered with VeVe (a popular digital collectable app) to release a collection of Christmas themed digital collectables. This drop included the classic Polar Bear, Coke Bottles, Neon Coca-Cola sign, and a singular Coke bottle. Each drop had a different list price, rarity level, and number of collectables available to purchase. VeVe is being used to simplify the process of purchasing and using NFTs.\n\n**Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte:** Coca-Cola recently announced it is launching a gaming-inspired version of a virtual Coke beverage, surrounding the Coca-Cola Starlight release. The first video game it will be available in will be Fortnite. Coke has teamed up with gaming organization PWR to help with the creation of Pixel Point, a custom island built in Fortnite Creative. Fortnite Creative is a separate mode within Fortnite that allows companies and players to build their own custom worlds. Once players enter Pixel Point, they can try out coke-themed mini-games, as well as ‘try’ the new drink flavors.\n\n**The Coca-Cola Combo Burger Day Collection:** This International Burger Day (May 28th), Coca-Cola dropped more than 4000 free, unique digital collectables celebrating the classic combination of an ice-cold Coca-Cola and a burger hot off the grill. Every Coca-Cola combo comes in a mysterious red bag and inside each bag you’ll find a generative burger with varying traits to satisfy every taste, and a classic bottle of Coca-Cola Zero that goes with every single one. This release was as floppy as a barely cooked burger, with virtually zero traction or interest from anyone. \\*\n\n**Coca-Cola Pride Collection**: The Coca-Cola Pride collection is a series of 136 digital collectibles made in celebration of the LGBTQIA+ community. The limited edition pieces feature an exclusive take on the iconic Coca-Cola bottle with artwork by Rich Mnisi, fashion designer and leading campaigner for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Africa. His commissioned design has been sliced into individual fragments and dispersed across all 136 collectibles, making each one unique. The collection aims to shine color-filled light on the LGBTQIA+ community's members and spread a message of Love. This collection was released on Polygon and currently has a low floor price and total volume.\n\n![Four different ways how not to release a branded NFT collection](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RSJZ07igKc1XkpGXT1qre.webp?height=767&width=767)\n\n## POS System\n\nCoca-Cola partnered with connectivity platform Omnivore to create a digital marketplace that makes it easier for customers to order Coke products through a Menu Management System (MMS) . MMS helps restaurant brands manage the complexity of numerous digital menus across online ordering, third-party apps, menu boards, kiosks, and more. MMS integrates the POS system, resulting in order injection, data collection, and control of content. This can allow for immediate pricing updates, deeper analytics, and easier surcharging.\n\nUSD is the only accepted currency on Coca-Cola’s website for US customers. Coca-Cola’s website allows for SSO via Google, Facebook, and Apple.

These metrics are included below. The metrics for more recent collections were so unimpressive and low (sub 1ETH total volume) that making a dashboard for the collections seemed like a waste of time.\n\n## Secondary Market Analytics\n\n(Secondary sales for Coca-Cola are the same as the original price of the only NFT sold traditionally on [Opensea.io](http://Opensea.io).

Every single release has been a flop\n* Needs a bigger tech team focused on NFTs and metaverse content to stay competitive and roll out new offerings quicker; Coke needs to stop releasing boring NFT collections\n* There are little to no notable utilities associated with the NFTs offered, and the only notable NFT offered was sold at a price that is entirely unaffordable and unrealistic for the average consumer\n* Little to no incorporation of the metaverse events or NFTs on the main website; no mention of web3 offerings on the Coca-Cola app\n* IP is interested in web3 but at this point has invested very little and is cautious to invest more time and energy into the space\n\nOpportunities\n\n* Is easily one of the largest and most successful companies in the world, with a brand so recognizable it is hard to think of anything more cemented in American culture\n* The first NFT launch was met with a ton of interest and bidding from ardent fans; Coca-Cola can recover from a poor launch in ways other brands cannot\n* Digital brands are eager to partner with Coca-Cola, and the brand is being selective on how they proceed in the market\n\nThreats\n\n* The lack of a Coca-Cola Discord server means that any comparable competitor could beat them in the social media space just by appealing to younger audiences\n* Other major soda brands could just as easily and quickly embrace web3. Nothing Coke has done is not replicable by other brands\n* The success or failure of VeVe as the established and primary online platform for digital collectables could sway Coke from pursuing NFTs more seriously.

This has caused increased skepticism of the long-term viability of the VeVe platform\n* Waiting for the right moment to embrace the metaverse more strongly just means another brand may take their place and gain popularity online-Repeated flops could turn long-term web3 investors away permanently\n\n## Summary\n\nCoca-Cola is a legendary brand that is beginning to embrace web3 and finding unique ways to incorporate it into its brand IP. Although Coke has been slow to roll-out new NFT and metaverse offerings, previous releases have been well received by the public and have not induced backlash. Coca-Cola Combo Burger Day and LGBTQIA+ releases were to practically zero fanfare, with some of the lowest floor prices seen for a major brand (consequently also on Polygon). The Coca-Cola app shows no signs of incorporating cryptocurrency or NFTs anytime soon, which could mean that full adoption for the brand is some time away. It is difficult to derive the metrics from Coke’s VeVe release, given the closed nature of the platform. With a solid IP and impressive annual gross profit, Coke can take the time it needs to decide how best to proceed in the web3 market.\n\nSocial Media\n<https://www.instagram.com/cocacola/>\n<https://www.tiktok.com/@cocacola>\n<https://twitter.com/CocaCola>\n\nReferences\n<https://www.thedrum.com/news/2019/06/26/coca-cola-creates-digital-marketplace-make-ordering-easier>\n<https://nftnew.net/2022/04/08/the-coca-cola-x-veve-partner-will-turn-the-starlight-flavor-into-nft/>\n<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/omnivore-partners-with-coca-cola-to-launch-digital-menu-management-solution-300852719.html>\n<https://medium.com/veve-collectibles/coca-cola-snow-globes-ddc7444b6789>\n<https://maketafi.com/coca-cola-nft>\n<https://etherscan.io/address/0x455f04c9c54fffa699e9f6b1271e857a1f2bddfa>\n<https://www.ledgerinsights.com/coca-cola-nfts-pride/>\n<https://opensea.io/collection/the-coca-cola-combo-burger-day-collection>\n\nNeed help with your web3 go-to-market strategy?

Sustainability, sports partnerships, and mental health awareness are three consistent themes through Coke’s brand style and storytelling.\n\n## Initiatives\n\n***Coca-Cola app (web2)*:** Coca-Cola app is a customer loyalty program to ‘unlock refreshing surprises and redeem rewards—all at your fingertips’. Customers primarily interact with Coke’s loyalty program through the *Coca-Cola* app for iOS/Android. Coca-Cola app offerings include scanning icons on Coca-Cola packaging to earn ‘rewards and access personalized experiences’. Customers can create their own custom beverage mixes via Coca-Cola Freestyle®, and can receive location-based rewards and offers at theaters and restaurants.\n\n**Coca-Cola Insiders Club:** Insider’s Club was a box subscription service that Coca-Cola tested as a service from January 2021 to March 2021.

The void showed me I was still on the first few steps of my thousand mile journey.\n\nI clutched my sword as the void lit up around me. It became strings of numbers and letters flying past. I tentatively reached my sword out to tap it. Suddenly, those numbers and letters flowed up the sword and through my being.\n\nIn an instant, the history of technology since 1917 passed through my mind: machines to computers to virtual life. I now understood I was a digital being.\n\nThen the void's numbers and letters morphed into animated images like me: all kinds, all colors. I plunged my sword into the stream and the images began flowing through me. In an instant, I lived the history of animation.\n\n![Illustration by TsukiMidnight](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/igsILrzhYefv4PHwxrbC-.jpg?height=3000&width=1500)\n\nThe magic of anime flowed into my heart and mind.

Later, I moved on to his disco-oriented solo work. I've always been struck by how he could bring melodic warmth to electronic sounds. This hypnotic piece is a perfect example. It's trance-inducing yet gets the pulse racing - and that makes it a perfect soundtrack for Hekonai diving head-first into the mysteries of his new world.*\n\n**The Hekonai's Journal is an ongoing meta-narrative.

This initiative would make Cannabis Genome DAO the first digital cooperative to maintain an ownership stake in a physical laboratory. As such, Cannabis Genome DAO would be granted full rights of a member of the company with access to financial reporting and an ability to ensure that the fidelity and transparency of laboratory practices are maintained. The alignment of incentives and governance rights between a community that benefits from using the laboratory, with the governance and incentives of the laboratory operations itself, directly benefits the community and users of the laboratories services.\n\n## Overview of Proposed Crowdfund\n\nFunding would go toward purchasing a membership interest in Delta Leaf, which is currently undergoing equity fundraising in pursuit of a traditional VC investment or strategic partnership from another organization. This provides the opportunity for Cannabis Genome DAO to fill that need. Funding from the sale of membership interest in Delta Leaf would be used for improving and expanding their services. These services include an upgrade to the Delta Leaf web app that would enable users to manage their laboratory results using self-custodial web3 wallets with the option to publish directly to the data marketplace being developed by Cannabis Genome DAO. Governance of Delta Leaf would be aligned with the mission and values of Cannabis Genome DAO because members of the latter would exert a significant amount of direct control over the operations of the former.\n\nThe crowdfund would be hosted here on Mirror and structured as a sale of a collection of tiered NFT editions. More information below.\n\n* [Cannabis Genome DAO](https://cannabisgeno.me) (“CGD”) would purchase a 20% membership interest in [Delta Leaf Laboratories LLC](https://deltaleaflabs.com) (“Delta Leaf”), a California Limited Liability Corporation.\n* Cannabis Genome DAO (“CGD\") is a \"[nonprofit association](https://ipfs//bafybeifzhrfh47zq743j35hq7v6lwmoqizzj665hwp7zzoqig6abveog6i/?filename=Delaware_UNA_Agreement_-_CGD.pdf)\" under the Delaware Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, §§ 1901-1916. CGD is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a partnership.\n* Governance of the CGD’s membership interest in Delta Leaf would be managed through the distribution of DLL tokens to members of CGD who contribute to this fundraiser.\n* The total DLL token supply would exclusively distribute governance rights to CGD members and does not distribute ownership right in Delta Leaf to individual members of CGD.\n* DLL tokens would not, and will not, represent any financial claim by individual CGD members to potential profit or obligation to potential losses incurred by CGD while CGD is acting as a member of Delta Leaf.\n* CGD and the CGD treasury would incur all financial profit and loss related to membership of CGD in Delta Leaf. The proceeds of this crowdfund will be sent to the CGD community multi-sig for the explicit purpose of completing the purchase of a membership interest in Delta Leaf as described herein.\n\n![Felipe's cousin Isaac made this graphic years ago.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D9MgsIfEXNqBfUuhtGwnJ.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n## DLL Token Allocations\n\nGovernance of Delta Leaf comprises a subset of the proposed activities encompassed by the [CGD Community Hyperthesis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/182fZ2WIQCL15O0TbQmkaJFM8tci06czuuqTMzBl_-zs/edit?usp=sharing). Therefore, the token allocation will primarily be distributed directly to participants in the crowdfunding campaign with only 20% being reserved for community management by CGD itself. This will decentralize governance directly to financial supporters while aligning them with the remaining CGD community who does not participate in the crowdfunding campaign or joins the community later after the campaign ends. Further, an additional 10% will be reserved for incentivizing the ongoing development of infrastructure for the regenerative crypto-economic system proposed in the CGD Community Hyperthesis. This third portion will align the potential success of this crowdfund with the CGD ecosystem in the short term.\n\n* 70% of the DLL token supply will be allocated directly to CGD members who contribute to the fundraiser.\n* 20% of the DLL token supply will be reserved in the CGD treasury and managed by a community multi-sig wallet.\n  * Multi-sig address: 0xb39EB13E9B69809ed938842D5Ea1A89a97787315\n* 10% of the DLL token supply will be sent to a separate multi-sig wallet to be used exclusively for incentivizing the development of CSAT token smart contracts, a custom front-end for CannaData.Market and other initiatives for CGD.\n  * Multi-sig address: 0x99A05055820f8c4794879B2617b520513C7DFca1\n\n## Who Are The Members of Delta Leaf?\n\n![Action shots of Delta Leaf from the 2017 UCSB New Venture Fair & Competition.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Py4GiPSOEjCeoBW-Z2-B.png?height=673&width=2251)\n\n### 1.

Not because I was heroic or anything: it was just one outsider responding to another.\n\nThat couldn't be the only reason. I looked deeper and saw that he was frustrated at work. He spent his days drawing animation cells for other people's designs.

It was their stab at a concept album. It was a commercial failure and remains hotly debated by fans but has built its own cult following because it's so unique. This song explores the importance of having someone to look up to, making it perfect for that moment when Hekonai discovers the human he idealizes is struggling to hang on. It's got the gentlest vocal Gene Simmons ever recorded and his poignant tone, combined with elegant orchestration, just might give you serious feels when you hear it.*\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**The Hekonai's Journal** is an ongoing meta-narrative.

The portals quickly began growing in size as their revolutions sped up.\n\nDid I just sign my own death warrant?\n\n*Please enjoy the next post #5 below in the Hekonai Journal:*\n\n[https://tinyurl.com/3d9wcxp6](https://tinyurl.com/3d9wcxp6)\n\n**Post Soundtrack:**\n\n[In The Space Capsule (The Love Theme) - Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iQpThqdMbo?&autoplay=true&display=iframe)\n\nIn the author’s mind: *Like a lot of '80s babies, I grew up loving the film Flash Gordon and this grandfathered me into loving the music of Queen. This cue scored the journey of the rocket containing the heroes into the kingdom of Ming The Merciless and it's got a mix of electronic dreaminess and martial percussion plus a fantastic orchestral tag.

This morning my wife mentioned she was reading a book on comfort. What’s are good ways to make sense of these sorts of claims? It definitely felt true. We also can’t exactly ask whether humans living 120,000 years ago didn’t also create problems or whether they thought they were comfortable. Is that type of skepticism actually useful though? \n3. What are good personal digital hygiene habits? Things like being intentional about checking the news, email, social media and the many other information inputs that can easily overwhelm us. \n   1. This sort of thing can lapse into the self-help ish space though there definitely seems to be a big gap and appetite for useful rules and practices to deal with what can feel like chaos.\n   2. There are good books written by thoughtful folks like Cal Newport that talk about these dynamics at an individual level. What are the right type of institutions that can help people that struggle to deal with the information avalanche? \n   3. There are also well intentioned yet polemical books like Jaron Lanier’s book *Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now*.

{"id": "zsgdaylZUfCDgnrLvz51btTczmtIy4lpEPUEp0fNgig", "title": "Artist Spotlight: Abieyuwa", "body": "### Meet Abieyuwa.\n\nAbieyuwa is a multidisciplinary artist and curator. She has created various works about colorism, cultural pride, and mental health, specifically focusing on how they relate to the lives of black women. She is passionate about creating art through a variety of tools and media including photography, digital and analog video, 3D modeling, and acrylic paint. Abieyuwa identifies as Nigerian-American and you can see that in her work which portray narratives that represent her lived experience, and her Esan and Igbo culture. She couples her experience with her aptitude for technology to explore themes that reflect being a black woman in contemporary society. In 2020 amidst the pandemic she began a series that featured African women from different countries and cultures to shatter the stereotypes of similarity between women from different African nations, highlighting their individuality first and foremost. Abieyuwa is hoping to continue this series in the future, expanding to represent more countries and tribal groups that are unseen in the media. Among many other prestigious publications her portraits have been exhibited at the Houston Center for Photography in the *Contemporary Practice* and *Togethering*  exhibitions. Her goals center around inspiring black women of all ages, especially the young black girl(s) she once was, hoping they feel represented, valued, and highlighted in her work. She wants to see her work uplift and encourage these women:\n\n> I hope that they will feel that they are being accurately represented and will feel pride. I hope that my work will uplift and encourage them to embrace our natural beauty and ignore messages that constantly attack our self-worth and self-esteem.      - Abieyuwa\n\n### Communities\n\nAbieyuwa is involved in multiple communities of artists that align with her mission and views: \n\n> I’ve definitely learned a lot from my peers, especially my friend King Uranta. His 3D work inspires me so I’m constantly asking him questions and for feedback on my work because I value his opinion a lot. I actually learn from all my fellow 3D artists such as MadebyM1ke, Hyper9, Prince Ude, Rayan El-Nayal, etc. We have a Twitter community where we share WIPs and ask for each other’s advice on software and techniques.          - Abieyuwa\n\nOne of these communities, [African NFT Community](https://twitter.com/africannftclub), is an empowered community of African creators digitally sharing their cultural influence through NFTs. Their goal is to provide the platform and resources to help African creators navigate the web3 world so they can leverage the true power of the digital revolution and make a name for themselves in the digital art world. They are working to achieve this by providing educational opportunities, advice, and support via community round tables and live rooms on Clubhouse and Twitter spaces. Their organization operates as a DAO to allow for input in decision making processes and resource allocation, as well as equity for the African artists. Within the community Abieyuwa is on the core team and works with a variety of tools to express herself in her art. In short, the African NFT Club is an incubator that advocates for African artists by giving them the tools to break down barriers and spread their influence across the world. Abieyuwa is also closely involved in Cybet Baat which is a playground for creators of African descent in the metaverse; Herstory, an art collective dedicated to preserving and incubating the stories of marginalized crypto creators; and A2 Accelerate Art, a decentralized community of creatives, collectors and builders focused on supporting emerging artists. \n\n### Art\n\nAbieyuwa has been in love with art and drawing since she was a child growing up in Nigeria. As a child she was always watching cartoons and creating some of her own. In high school, she took art electives every year and had plans on majoring in Visual Arts. When she got to college she decided to major in something more “serious,” thinking she couldnt make a career out of her art. Fast forward to post graduation and her first full time job, she realized her true calling was in art. Abieyuwa’s style of art is versatile. She is interested in drawing and painting as well as digital art, photography and video. Her inspiration comes from black women, which you can see as the usual subject in her art. She also utilizes symbols and designs of her ancestors in her art to represent where she comes from: \n\n>  I did research on pre-colonial traditions of the Esan & Igbo tribes of Nigeria. These tribes are where my family is from and I used elements from them in my art. For my series of work celebrating nail art, I incorporated Igbo uli symbols from my research to bring more awareness to the artform that was looked down on by English colonizers. I’ve also created work inspired by the traditional bridal attire of Edo/Esan brides.             - Abieyuwa\n\nShe believes representation is important in all areas of life. Her art embodies the divine feminine that exists in every woman regardless of race. The subject of her art, black women, are showcased in angelic poses wearing lavish attire which brings out the divinity in them. She utilizes bright colors to provide contrast and make the focal point of her art stand out. Abieyuwa is a very talented and passionate artist, time and time again her work is nothing short of a masterpiece. \n\n### Gallery\n\n![“Déesse de l'eau\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zkcRYIiSduVgtSnJMHOXE.jpeg?height=1200&width=960)\n\n![\"A Heavy Burden\" ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3S_2AHq-YD8XaNF5uGyUa.jpeg?height=933&width=1200)\n\n![\"Obhiaha's Magazine\" ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yOt68_3ktT1fu2xDLIJsL.jpeg?height=680&width=543)\n\n“Obhiaha’s Magazine” was originally crafted for NFT NYC’s diversity showcase.

Abieyuwa is also closely involved in Cybet Baat which is a playground for creators of African descent in the metaverse; Herstory, an art collective dedicated to preserving and incubating the stories of marginalized crypto creators; and A2 Accelerate Art, a decentralized community of creatives, collectors and builders focused on supporting emerging artists. \n\n### Art\n\nAbieyuwa has been in love with art and drawing since she was a child growing up in Nigeria. As a child she was always watching cartoons and creating some of her own. In high school, she took art electives every year and had plans on majoring in Visual Arts. When she got to college she decided to major in something more “serious,” thinking she couldnt make a career out of her art. Fast forward to post graduation and her first full time job, she realized her true calling was in art. Abieyuwa’s style of art is versatile. She is interested in drawing and painting as well as digital art, photography and video. Her inspiration comes from black women, which you can see as the usual subject in her art. She also utilizes symbols and designs of her ancestors in her art to represent where she comes from: \n\n> “I did research on pre-colonial traditions of the Esan & Igbo tribes of Nigeria. These tribes are where my family is from and I used elements from them in my art. For my series of work celebrating nail art, I incorporated Igbo uli symbols from my research to bring more awareness to the artform that was looked down on by English colonizers. I’ve also created work inspired by the traditional bridal attire of Edo/Esan brides.”           - Abieyuwa\n\nShe believes representation is important in all areas of life. Her art embodies the divine feminine that exists in every woman regardless of race. The subject of her art, black women, are showcased in angelic poses wearing lavish attire which brings out the divinity in them. She utilizes bright colors to provide contrast and make the focal point of her art stand out. Abieyuwa is a very talented and passionate artist, time and time again her work is nothing short of a masterpiece. \n\n### Gallery\n\n![“Déesse de l'eau\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zkcRYIiSduVgtSnJMHOXE.jpeg?height=1200&width=960)\n\n![\"A Heavy Burden\" ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3S_2AHq-YD8XaNF5uGyUa.jpeg?height=933&width=1200)\n\n![\"Obhiaha's Magazine\" ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yOt68_3ktT1fu2xDLIJsL.jpeg?height=680&width=543)\n\n“Obhiaha’s Magazine” was originally crafted for NFT NYC’s diversity showcase.

{"id": "LBJkaKf6RiZ3hgBY47EGOGoBhUPed-hHvqGcujzyhO0", "title": "Review: Bringing better governance to real-world communities with quadratic funding", "body": "**TL;DR: city3 and Gitcoin’s first local quadratic funding experiment saw 7 Oakland nonprofits raise \\~$4,000 from 240+ unique contributors. In this recap we share the opportunities and challenges in bringing innovative governance models to offline communities.**\n\nCity3’s mission is to create more just socio-economic systems powered by crypto for existing real world communities. As part of this effort, we recently partnered with [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) to bring quadratic funding to the city of Oakland.\n\n[Quadratic funding](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000) (QF) is a mathematically and democratically optimal way to fund public goods, where matching capital is distributed based on a quadratic formula that makes the number of contributors matter more than the amount raised.\n\n![Quadratic funding explained (EOS)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8CJudW5yeHroHo9FiCaH2.png?height=415&width=768)\n\nWe originally set out with three broad questions outlined in our [announcement](https://mirror.xyz/0xcity3.eth/8ZgDDZcixWbLW9Jb79Vuc5illbB5IiKU-c-NyCfabEQ):\n\n* Is supporting an organization that you care about an effective incentive for someone to set up a web3 wallet?\n* What can quadratic funding tell us about the way people value civic organizations?\n* Will small dollar contributors feel they’ve made a significant contribution?\n\nIn this article we highlight two major takeaways from the experience:\n\n1. **To optimize positive results, we should identify the types of decisions and/or public goods that thrive when QF is applied.** We recommend a stronger alignment with the two problems QF is designed to address: information asymmetry and the free rider problem.\n2. **Governance experiments need to prioritize building trust, accessibility and diverse representation.** Funding real-world public goods comes with its own set of challenges, but existing tools are not designed for offline communities. This is an open call for more QF projects “in the wild”.\n\n# Overview and results\n\nDuring [Gitcoin Grants Round 14](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gr14-results/) which ran from 8-23 June 2022, 7 Oakland nonprofits raised $3,799.07 from 454 contributions and 249 unique contributors. $15,000 has been set aside for matching, funded jointly by city3 and the [Oakland Fund for Public Innovation](https://www.oaklandfund.org/).\n\n![Gitcoin’s quadratic funding local cause round for Oakland](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eh6o2W2RW1rMLSWhG70zd.png?height=1488&width=1830)\n\nAlthough contributing to the round was open to anyone, we hosted a series of virtual governance workshops aimed at assisting locals with setting up a non-custodial crypto wallet and Github account, and then navigating Gitcoin’s checkout process.\n\nDuring these workshops we saw firsthand how most web3 tools are simply not designed for offline communities, let alone mobile-first users.\n\nYet despite the friction, several residents expressed surprise that crypto could be used in this way. For those interacting with crypto for the first time, there was something viscerally meaningful about seeing a $5 donation get matched with $30 for an organization in their community. Those already familiar with crypto expressed a desire to see more of these initiatives:\n\n> *“I am currently working full time for a DAO, and it's cool how global it is, but would love to get more involved \\[with\\] local web3/crypto efforts.”*\n\nExact numbers on local participation are not available, but by combining Gitcoin’s profile location data with the number of people who attended our governance workshops and/or responded to our feedback surveys, we estimate that 20% of contributors were Oakland residents.\n\nClearly, there exists some critical threshold at which representation either justifies or undermines the entire quadratic funding process. This also highlights why education and accessibility are so important, and ought to be considered integral to any effective quadratic funding program.\n\nConsider a hypothetical grants round with higher-stakes decisions. While outside funding might still be useful to maximize funds raised, would we still weigh votes equally between locals and non-locals? We’re excited about the early although untested solutions that attempt to solve this, such as intersectional social data (see [RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/2019-10-24-uh78r5/)) or geo-spatial weighting (see [Astral Protocol](https://docs.astral.global/) or [Foam](https://foam.space/)).\n\n# Where does quadratic funding matter most?\n\nIn their 2020 paper, *[Building Radical Cities](https://assets.website-files.com/5d253237e31f051057dc0a2b/5f04beb70336ec0cc37ceff9_Building%20Radical%20Charter%20Cities.pdf)*, Paul Healy and Matt Prewitt identify QF as one of several mechanisms to better calibrate political expression at the city level. QF has been a popular choice for distributing public grants in the cryptosphere. For example, Gitcoin Grants Round 14 saw record breaking numbers: over 44,000 contributors donated $1.7M which will be boosted by a $3.2M matching pool.\n\nJust as QF supports “long tail” crypto projects – novel, small initiatives that otherwise would not be able to accumulate startup capital – we set out to test whether the same could be applied to long tail “real-world” projects, particularly civic organizations that play a critical role in serving their communities. While several offline projects have raised funds with Gitcoin in the past, this was the first time matching was targeted at a specific geographic community.\n\nWe are incredibly proud to have worked with Oakland nonprofits doing important work ranging from tech mentorship to supporting gang-impacted youth. And while we believe that nothing bad happens when impactful community organizations get money they deserve, in hindsight we do question whether funding local nonprofits was the most useful application of this governance tool.\n\nThe benefit of QF lies not so much in matching large sums of capital to small donations as in surfacing the nuance of community preferences in order to produce the best possible allocation outcome for decisions involving competing public goods.\n\nHere we turn to the two problems QF is most cited to solve:\n\n1. **QF solves an information problem.** In a world of scarce resources, the government (or more broadly, the public) does not always know how much of a certain good to provide\n2. **QF solves a free rider problem.** Those who benefit from public goods often underpay or don’t pay at all because there is little incentive to make small, individual contributions.\n\nWe believe we could have done a better job of scoping the problem space and designing our QF program to directly address these areas. For our next experiment, we may consider these questions as part of our decision making framework:\n\n1. What are some examples of competing public goods that we find difficult to prioritize in the local city budget?\n2. What are some areas of public resource allocation that people frequently complain feels unrepresentative and/or unfair?\n3. What are some alternative governance models already being applied in the community (e.g. participatory budgeting, neighborhood council advisory boards) – are they willing to try a new approach?\n\n# A call for more quadratic funding “in the wild”\n\nSome of our biggest coordination challenges exist at the city level. While there is growing interest in new governance models enabled by web3 technology, we haven’t seen these implemented outside of [a few examples](https://twitter.com/0xcity3/status/1534576283232763905). In other words, whether quadratic funding is indeed democratically and economically optimal is yet to be tested at scale.\n\nWe see a massive opportunity to combine the best of tokenized governance with decisions that tangibly affect the communities we live in. Several organizations are already doing work that makes this possible:\n\n* [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)\n* [Endaoment](https://endaoment.org/)\n* [Change](https://getchange.io/)\n* [RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/)\n* [Clr.fund](https://clr.fund/#/)\n* [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/)\n\nWe hope to see more crypto tools designed to serve real-world communities. For this to happen, we simultaneously need to invest in [pre-existing social infrastructure](https://otherinter.net/research/local-gov/) that has a long legacy of making our cities more just, more livable and more resilient.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe believe that QF is only as impactful as it is accessible and only as useful as it solves critical problems that could not be solved through simpler means.\n\nThe Oakland local cause round was the first of many programs city3 will be launching to bridge web3 innovation with real-world community needs. Just as crypto crowdfunding has expanded possibilities for seeding public goods, we have a unique opportunity to shift resource allocation within our cities.\n\n[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xcity3) to stay up to date with our work.", "timestamp": 1658174812, "digest": "SjQdVyClJxNBbANfxAQCHwwjKmqkeyOgb0WoZL5ilpk", "contributor": "0x27F2a7D8ce449C9A1E35Fc859Aa0d1053f5E47D3"}
{"id": "v9F5EIgL_HMvL4jePB-N-uPPPxZH96DSyS3cWe2JURs", "title": "Crypto's Native Frontier", "body": "For billions of people around the globe, Web3 represents an opportunity to realize a vibrant new digital world – one that isn’t designed and controlled by a handful of executives in the glass towers of primarily Western megacities.\n\nIt isn’t just about economic empowerment, either. \n\n**Web3 offers transformative potential that stretches deep into the realms of cultural identity, entertainment, and communication… and ultimately into the place where these concepts have converged for thousands of years: gaming.**\n\nThe Crypto Revolution is going to reshape our world not because engineers in Silicon Valley are creating a new generation of user technology, but because Web3’s diverse participants are creating open infrastructure that people everywhere will use to build new worlds themselves.\n\nToday, gaming is a $200B market composed of 3 billion gamers and the fastest evolving form of media in the world.\n\nIn order to understand why gaming will be a core frontier in the context of the social-technological revolution playing out today, we first need to explore gaming’s history and trajectory.\n\n> ## The Very Beginning:\n\nGaming is as native to human culture as language is (and may even predate it). \n\n**Serving as an invaluable social mechanism throughout history, we’ve used games to bond, teach, develop our values, and make sense of the world.**\n\nThe cradle of civilization that was the Middle East naturally saw the emergence of the first examples. In the 3000s BC, Mesopotamians played The Royal Game of Ur on beautifully painted boards, while the Egyptians played Senet.\n\nChaturanga would formally appear in India around 600 AD, though examples of its predecessors date back to 3000 BC. The Persians adopted it as Shatranj before European traders brought it over and turned it into Chess.\n\nAs far back as 2000 BC, Mesoamericans were playing a ballgame on courts. The activity was of immense societal importance, incorporated in rituals and used to resolve conflicts or even war.\n\nThis era also saw Ancient China develop Wei Qi – known today as Go – originally used to practice and refine strategic thinking. Later Chinese dynasties would also invent playing cards and dominoes.\n\n* ***Games have always held enormous societal significance across a variety of contexts – military, social, educational, and entertainment \n ***\n* ***We now think of it as an industry, but throughout the majority of our history gaming was an intrinsic activity that underpinned most of culture \n ***\n* ***We congratulate ourselves for our use of games to teach, train, and connect, when in reality humans have very effectively used games to do all of this for thousands of years \n ***\n* ***Today’s progressive gamification of society – investing, learning, working, collaborating – is really just a revival of an ancient behavior codified in our brains***\n\n> ## Back to the Future:\n\nGerman-American engineer Ralph Baer, inspired by the mass production and ownership of televisions as a key primitive, first envisioned a game that could be played on a home television in 1966. The following year, he and his colleagues at Sanders Associates invented a prototype system known as “The Black Box” – the first multiplayer console video game system, initially licensed under the name of “Magnavox Odyssey.”\n\n* ***This is an important point in the nature of technology: the creation of a new primitive (in this case, televisions) combines with an existing human behavior (gaming) to unlock a universe of new possibilities***\n\nThe Odyssey would soon inspire its competitor Atari to launch its own video game in 1972/3, initially an arcade video game called Pong that would later be turned into a version playable at home.\n\n* ***Both the history and future of gaming are underpinned by social connections: yesterday’s arcades will be tomorrow’s metaverse***\n\n> ## Leveling Up with Composability:\n\nAtari broke new ground in 1977 by launching the Atari 2600 VCS that allowed users to switch out game cartridges via an external ROM slot. Though Atari built dozens of games themselves, their creation of generalizable gaming hardware allowed third-party programmers across the globe to design their own games for the console.\n\nOther novel features included levels with increasing difficulty, scoring systems, and leaderboards, setting the stage for the communities that would soon form around games themselves.\n\n> ## New Entrants:\n\nAn intense wave of consumer demand, fueled by the launch of massively popular games like Space Invaders, was followed by a crash in the industry as excessive hype led to an oversupply of cheap games.\n\nThe crash wouldn’t last long, however, as a new (yet very old) powerhouse would rise from the East. Nintendo, founded in 1889 as a manufacturer of playing cards, launched a number of titles in the early 1980s that would shape the industry forever, including Donkey Kong, Mario Bros., Zelda, and other major titles.\n\nNintendo also launched its own console: the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), featuring significant technological improvements relative to its existing peers.\n\nIn 1989, Nintendo made history once more by releasing the first handheld Game Boy – forever transforming the world of gaming and **setting the stage for the mobile revolution that would come many years later**.\n\nAs we’ll explore later, gaming’s biggest domain has shifted to mobile, paying homage to one of its earliest and most important innovations.\n\n* ***Consoles were never the endgame – they were the intermediate medium while the hardware and software caught up during a long period of intense development***\n\n> ## Upgrading the Stack:\n\nThe console wars of the 1990s saw companies like Sega, Nintendo, and Sony battle for dominance as they leveraged a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem to develop increasingly sophisticated consoles and game franchises.\n\n**In parallel,** **the technological explosion that engulfed the world in the ‘80s and ‘90s saw computers enter millions of homes**. \n\nThe tremendous increase in computing power allowed developers to supercharge their efforts, leading to the dawn of three-dimensional gaming experiences and online play.\n\nAs more homes came online, LAN parties became extremely popular, with players meeting up in person to compete by connecting to the local network.\n\nThe 2000’s saw a new era of console wars, this time between Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation), and Nintendo (Wii), **with** **competition centering on graphics, quality of storyline, and, eventually, the online gaming experience**. Marketplaces sprung up, allowing users to purchase titles or downloadable content, upgrade software, and communicate with other players.\n\nAdvanced open world games with simulated autonomous characters also became extremely popular as a predecessor to the digital metaverse boom we’re seeing today.\n\nPC-based MMORPGs became a global phenomenon in their own right, competing less on graphics or story and more on community, digital identity, and portability.\n\n* ***The explosion in PC gaming offered a glimpse of what billions of users would ultimately prioritize in their gaming experiences***\n\n> ## Going Mobile:\n\nDecreasing computing and hardware costs allowed the global gaming audience to grow exponentially over the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n**Just as the prevalence of personal computers provided a new medium for the industry to expand into, so too did the billions of mobile phones produced in the late 2000s and early 2010s offer a new route for adoption.**\n\nMobile gaming continued where PC-based gaming left off, prioritizing experiences that offered portability, simplicity, and community interaction. \n\n**The rise of mobile phones as the primary computing hardware used by billions of people saw the gaming demographic expand into casual players of all ages**, with low-cost games spinning up to meet every user profile.\n\nThe market for mobile games was worth \\~$120B in 2021 and is expected to triple over the next decade as the computing stack gets even better.\n\n* ***As with TVs before, the mobile transformation offers further proof of a recurring historical pattern: technological infrastructure introduced for one purpose tends to unlock astonishing value across myriad others \n ***\n* ***Blockchains will likely end up underpinning trillions in value across cultural and social use cases we have yet to imagine, extending well beyond the initial applications in decentralized finance***\n\n> ## Beyond Gaming:\n\nJust as the demographic has expanded tremendously over gaming’s first few decades, so too has its very meaning.\n\n**Two critical developments took place in the late 2010s:**\n\n**1) The ability to integrate real world culture into the game itself**\n\n**2) The creation of in-game economies for digital assets**\n\nFranchises like Fortnite were early pioneers in recognizing that online gaming was as much about the competition as it was about expressing social identity and connecting over cultural movements in an open, digital environment.\n\n* ***The industry’s life cycle has seen a steady convergence of social interactions and traditional gaming, with the former seemingly on track to eventually eclipse the latter in importance***\n\n\n* ***Ultimately, Fortnite and others have become enablers of a new world in which the peripheral gaming experience often matters most: video streaming, chat, digital cosmetics, microtransactions, etc***\n\n> ## Decentralizing Web2:\n\nThe rise of Roblox – a platform facilitating and hosting user-created games – represents another major industry development. **Roblox boasts an incredible \\~200M monthly active users, with over 70% of user sessions taking place on mobile devices.**\n\nJust as YouTube broke ground by making video content creation open to everyone, Roblox has turned players into builders (though most users are still only players).\n\nRoblox includes its own in-game currency (Robux) that players can use to purchase items in its digital economy.\n\nThe Steam Deck is another fascinating development. \n\n**Built on an open-source operating system (Linux), the Steam Deck offers cross-platform capabilities** for players to access games from a range of developers, as well as older games using emulation software.\n\n**The rise of Cloud Gaming is another emerging trend making gaming accessible to everyone.** Now, players don’t need to invest in expensive hardware to access incredible games anywhere in the world.\n\n* ***These colossal themes playing out are a major reason why Web3 makes sense as the logical successor domain for gaming: the ideological alignment is extraordinary \n ***\n* ***The shift away from expensive hardware and closed ecosystems, the proliferation of a rich social layer, and the quest for creative ownership are inevitably driving the industry towards a blockchain-enabled future***\n\n> ## Play to Earn:\n\nThe blockchain revolution naturally started with financial applications, given the original purpose of Bitcoin itself was to create a peer-to-peer decentralized transaction system. So it shouldn’t be surprising that the tactics that worked early on in DeFi were soon applied to the world of Web3 gaming.\n\n**In particular, two areas saw the most significant amount of early adoption:**\n\n* **Blockchain-enabled marketplaces for in-game digital assets**\n* **Native gaming tokens that had in-game utility but more importantly served to reward early players**\n\nHowever, most of crypto’s early games have largely been built off-chain, with only the digital economies themselves (exchange and settlement) taking place on-chain.\n\n**Ultimately, these games crashed back to earth due to a few key problems:**\n\n* **Terrible gaming experiences centered on yield generation, inevitably attracting short term mercenaries \n **\n* **Poorly thought-out economies with native governance and utility tokens effectively programmed to go to zero \n **\n* **Closed-wall infrastructure that is neither composable nor interoperable**\n\n> ## Where We’ve Fallen Short:\n\nThe approach to date has essentially been to **take DeFi and build narratives with prehistoric graphics and storylines on top of it**. Predictably, this approach fell into a dangerous purgatory, having failed to attract serious players or even durable traders.\n\n**The next phase of Web3 gaming is gravitating towards improved graphics and storylines, as well as better economic design**. \n\nThis new route won’t be a walk in the park either.\n\nBy competing on the DeFi front, games were effectively fighting for attention using yield. This strategy was nearsighted but admittedly worked in a market that could only go up.\n\nBy making graphics and storylines the new industry battleground, Web3 developers are taking on the traditional AAA studios who have an extraordinary head start.\n\nMore importantly, truly crypto-native solutions are less likely to get built this way. This approach feels a lot more like the late ‘90s equivalent of taking every business and throwing “.com” in front of it.\n\n**Builders need to be wary of forcing crypto rails into unnatural use cases.**\n\nThe other issue lies in making gaming an asset-based experience at its core, rather than a social one. By doing so, we create barriers to entry that can be exploited by developers, guilds, speculators, and other potentially malicious actors, thereby derailing crypto’s mission to empower the world.\n\n* ***If crypto-native developers want to win, they need to battle on home ground and on their own terms. Trying to beat the incumbents at their own game is a very challenging (and resource intensive) strategy***\n\n> ## Building On Crypto’s Unfair Advantage:\n\nThe true renaissance will occur as we start leveraging crypto rails to redefine what gaming looks like.\n\n**Part of that centers on the gaming experience:**\n\n* **Interoperability across games** so that players can transport their assets and inventories across different platforms without having to start over. This holds true for identity & in-game achievements as well. This really only works when the game is built entirely on-chain \n \n* **Trustless relationships between players** that conceal strategy and/or protect identity.

In the 3000s BC, Mesopotamians played The Royal Game of Ur on beautifully painted boards, while the Egyptians played Senet.\n\nChaturanga would formally appear in India around 600 AD, though examples of its predecessors date back to 3000 BC. The Persians adopted it as Shatranj before European traders brought it over and turned it into Chess.\n\nAs far back as 2000 BC, Mesoamericans were playing a ballgame on courts. The activity was of immense societal importance, incorporated in rituals and used to resolve conflicts or even war.\n\nThis era also saw Ancient China develop Wei Qi – known today as Go – originally used to practice and refine strategic thinking. Later Chinese dynasties would also invent playing cards and dominoes.\n\n* ***Games have always held enormous societal significance across a variety of contexts – military, social, educational, and entertainment \n ***\n* ***We now think of it as an industry, but throughout the majority of our history gaming was an intrinsic activity that underpinned most of culture \n ***\n* ***We congratulate ourselves for our use of games to teach, train, and connect, when in reality humans have very effectively used games to do all of this for thousands of years \n ***\n* ***Today’s progressive gamification of society – investing, learning, working, collaborating – is really just a revival of an ancient behavior codified in our brains \n ***\n\n> ## Back to the Future:\n\nGerman-American engineer Ralph Baer, inspired by the mass production and ownership of televisions as a key primitive, first envisioned a game that could be played on a home television in 1966. The following year, he and his colleagues at Sanders Associates invented a prototype system known as “The Black Box” – the first multiplayer console video game system, initially licensed under the name of “Magnavox Odyssey.”\n\n* ***This is an important point in the nature of technology: the creation of a new primitive (in this case, televisions) combines with an existing human behavior (gaming) to unlock a universe of new possibilities***\n\nThe Odyssey would soon inspire its competitor Atari to launch its own video game in 1972/3, initially an arcade video game called Pong that would later be turned into a version playable at home.\n\n* ***Both the history and future of gaming are underpinned by social connections: yesterday’s arcades will be tomorrow’s metaverse \n ***\n\n> ## Leveling Up with Composability:\n\nAtari broke new ground in 1977 by launching the Atari 2600 VCS that allowed users to switch out game cartridges via an external ROM slot. Though Atari built dozens of games themselves, their creation of generalizable gaming hardware allowed third-party programmers across the globe to design their own games for the console.\n\nOther novel features included levels with increasing difficulty, scoring systems, and leaderboards, setting the stage for the communities that would soon form around games themselves.\n\n> ## New Entrants:\n\nAn intense wave of consumer demand, fueled by the launch of massively popular games like Space Invaders, was followed by a crash in the industry as excessive hype led to an oversupply of cheap games.\n\nThe crash wouldn’t last long, however, as a new (yet very old) powerhouse would rise from the East.

The Persians adopted it as Shatranj before European traders brought it over and turned it into Chess.\n\nAs far back as 2000 BC, Mesoamericans were playing a ballgame on courts. The activity was of immense societal importance, incorporated in rituals and used to resolve conflicts or even war.\n\nThis era also saw Ancient China develop Wei Qi – known today as Go – originally used to practice and refine strategic thinking. Later Chinese dynasties would also invent playing cards and dominoes.\n\n* ***Games have always held enormous societal significance across a variety of contexts – military, social, educational, and entertainment***\n\n\n* ***We now think of it as an industry, but throughout the majority of our history gaming was an intrinsic activity that underpinned most of culture***\n\n\n* ***We congratulate ourselves for our use of games to teach, train, and connect, when in reality humans have very effectively used games to do all of this for thousands of years***\n\n\n* ***Today’s progressive gamification of society – investing, learning, working, collaborating – is really just a revival of an ancient behavior codified in our brains \n ***\n\n> ## Back to the Future:\n\nGerman-American engineer Ralph Baer, inspired by the mass production and ownership of televisions as a key primitive, first envisioned a game that could be played on a home television in 1966. The following year, he and his colleagues at Sanders Associates invented a prototype system known as “The Black Box” – the first multiplayer console video game system, initially licensed under the name of “Magnavox Odyssey.”\n\n* ***This is an important point in the nature of technology: the creation of a new primitive (in this case, televisions) combines with an existing human behavior (gaming) to unlock a universe of new possibilities***\n\nThe Odyssey would soon inspire its competitor Atari to launch its own video game in 1972/3, initially an arcade video game called Pong that would later be turned into a version playable at home.\n\n* ***Both the history and future of gaming are underpinned by social connections: yesterday’s arcades will be tomorrow’s metaverse \n ***\n\n> ## Leveling Up with Composability:\n\nAtari broke new ground in 1977 by launching the Atari 2600 VCS that allowed users to switch out game cartridges via an external ROM slot. Though Atari built dozens of games themselves, their creation of generalizable gaming hardware allowed third-party programmers across the globe to design their own games for the console.\n\nOther novel features included levels with increasing difficulty, scoring systems, and leaderboards, setting the stage for the communities that would soon form around games themselves. \n \n\n> ## New Entrants:\n\nAn intense wave of consumer demand, fueled by the launch of massively popular games like Space Invaders, was followed by a crash in the industry as excessive hype led to an oversupply of cheap games.\n\nThe crash wouldn’t last long, however, as a new (yet very old) powerhouse would rise from the East. Nintendo, founded in 1889 as a manufacturer of playing cards, launched a number of titles in the early 1980s that would shape the industry forever, including Donkey Kong, Mario Bros., Zelda, and other major titles.\n\nNintendo also launched its own console: the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), featuring significant technological improvements relative to its existing peers.\n\nIn 1989, Nintendo made history once more by releasing the first handheld Game Boy – forever transforming the world of gaming and **setting the stage for the mobile revolution that would come many years later**.\n\nAs we’ll explore later, gaming’s biggest domain has shifted to mobile, paying homage to one of its earliest and most important innovations.\n\n* ***Consoles were never the endgame – they were the intermediate medium while the hardware and software caught up during a long period of intense development \n ***\n\n> ## Upgrading the Stack:\n\nThe console wars of the 1990s saw companies like Sega, Nintendo, and Sony battle for dominance as they leveraged a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem to develop increasingly sophisticated consoles and game franchises.\n\n**In parallel,** **the technological explosion that engulfed the world in the ‘80s and ‘90s saw computers enter millions of homes**.\n\nThe tremendous increase in computing power allowed developers to supercharge their efforts, leading to the dawn of three-dimensional gaming experiences and online play.\n\nAs more homes came online, LAN parties became extremely popular, with players meeting up in person to compete by connecting to the local network.\n\nThe 2000’s saw a new era of console wars, this time between Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation), and Nintendo (Wii), **with** **competition centering on graphics, quality of storyline, and, eventually, the online gaming experience**. Marketplaces sprung up, allowing users to purchase titles or downloadable content, upgrade software, and communicate with other players.\n\nAdvanced open world games with simulated autonomous characters also became extremely popular as a predecessor to the digital metaverse boom we’re seeing today.\n\nPC-based MMORPGs became a global phenomenon in their own right, competing less on graphics or story and more on community, digital identity, and portability.\n\n* ***The explosion in PC gaming offered a glimpse of what billions of users would ultimately prioritize in their gaming experiences \n ***\n\n> ## Going Mobile:\n\nDecreasing computing and hardware costs allowed the global gaming audience to grow exponentially over the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n**Just as the prevalence of personal computers provided a new medium for the industry to expand into, so too did the billions of mobile phones produced in the late 2000s and early 2010s offer a new route for adoption.**\n\nMobile gaming continued where PC-based gaming left off, prioritizing experiences that offered portability, simplicity, and community interaction.\n\n**The rise of mobile phones as the primary computing hardware used by billions of people saw the gaming demographic expand into casual players of all ages, with low-cost games spinning up to meet every user profile.**\n\nThe market for mobile games was worth \\~$120B in 2021 and is expected to triple over the next decade as the computing stack gets even better.\n\n* ***As with TVs before, the mobile transformation offers further proof of a recurring historical pattern: technological infrastructure introduced for one purpose tends to unlock astonishing value across myriad others***\n\n\n* ***Blockchains will likely end up underpinning trillions in value across cultural and social use cases we have yet to imagine, extending well beyond the initial applications in decentralized finance \n ***\n\n> ## Beyond Gaming:\n\nJust as the demographic has expanded tremendously over gaming’s first few decades, so too has its very meaning.\n\n**Two critical developments took place in the late 2010s:**\n\n**1) The ability to integrate real world culture into the game itself**\n\n**2) The creation of in-game economies for digital assets**\n\nFranchises like Fortnite were early pioneers in recognizing that online gaming was as much about the competition as it was about expressing social identity and connecting over cultural movements in an open, digital environment.\n\n* **The industry’s life cycle has seen a steady convergence of social interactions and traditional gaming, with the former seemingly on track to eventually eclipse the latter in importance \n **\n* **Ultimately, Fortnite and others have become enablers of a new world in which the peripheral gaming experience often matters most: video streaming, chat, digital cosmetics, microtransactions, etc \n **\n\n> ## Decentralizing Web2:\n\nThe rise of Roblox – a platform facilitating and hosting user-created games – represents another major industry development. Roblox boasts an incredible \\~200M monthly active users, with over 70% of user sessions taking place on mobile devices.\n\n**Just as YouTube broke ground by making video content creation open to everyone, Roblox has turned players into builders (though most users are still only players).**\n\nRoblox includes its own in-game currency (Robux) that players can use to purchase items in its digital economy.\n\nThe Steam Deck is another fascinating development.\n\nBuilt on an open-source operating system (Linux), the Steam Deck offers cross-platform capabilities for players to access games from a range of developers, as well as older games using emulation software.\n\n**The rise of Cloud Gaming is another emerging trend making gaming accessible to everyone.**\n\nNow, players don’t need to invest in expensive hardware to access incredible games anywhere in the world.\n\n* ***These colossal themes playing out are a major reason why Web3 makes sense as the logical successor domain for gaming: the ideological alignment is extraordinary***\n\n\n* ***The shift away from expensive hardware and closed ecosystems, the proliferation of a rich social layer, and the quest for creative ownership are inevitably driving the industry towards a blockchain-enabled future \n ***\n\n> ## Play to Earn:\n\nThe blockchain revolution naturally started with financial applications, given the original purpose of Bitcoin itself was to create a peer-to-peer decentralized transaction system. So it shouldn’t be surprising that the tactics that worked early on in DeFi were soon applied to the world of Web3 gaming.\n\n**In particular, two areas saw the most significant amount of early adoption:**\n\n* **Blockchain-enabled marketplaces for in-game digital assets \n **\n* **Native gaming tokens that had in-game utility but more importantly served to reward early players**\n\nHowever, most of crypto’s early games have largely been built off-chain, with only the digital economies themselves (exchange and settlement) taking place on-chain.\n\n**Ultimately, these games crashed back to earth due to a few key problems:**\n\n* **Terrible gaming experiences centered on yield generation, inevitably attracting short term mercenaries \n **\n* **Poorly thought-out economies with native governance and utility tokens effectively programmed to go to zero \n **\n* **Closed-wall infrastructure that is neither composable nor interoperable** \n \n\n> ## Where We’ve Fallen Short:\n\nThe approach to date has essentially been to **take DeFi and build narratives with prehistoric graphics and storylines on top of it**. Predictably, this approach fell into a dangerous purgatory, having failed to attract serious players or even durable traders.\n\n**The next phase of Web3 gaming is gravitating towards improved graphics and storylines, as well as better economic design**.\n\nThis new route won’t be a walk in the park either.\n\nBy competing on the DeFi front, games were effectively fighting for attention using yield. This strategy was nearsighted but admittedly worked in a market that could only go up.\n\nBy making graphics and storylines the new industry battleground, Web3 developers are taking on the traditional AAA studios who have an extraordinary head start.\n\nMore importantly, truly crypto-native solutions are less likely to get built this way. This approach feels a lot more like the late ‘90s equivalent of taking every business and throwing “.com” in front of it.\n\n**Builders need to be wary of forcing crypto rails into unnatural use cases.**\n\nThe other issue lies in making gaming an asset-based experience at its core, rather than a social one. By doing so, we create barriers to entry that can be exploited by developers, guilds, speculators, and other potentially malicious actors, thereby derailing crypto’s mission to empower the world.\n\n* ***If crypto-native developers want to win, they need to battle on home ground and on their own terms. Trying to beat the incumbents at their own game is a very challenging (and resource intensive) strategy \n ***\n\n> ## Building On Crypto’s Unfair Advantage:\n\nThe true renaissance will occur as we start leveraging crypto rails to redefine what gaming looks like.\n\n**Part of that centers on the gaming experience:**\n\n* **Interoperability across games** so that players can transport their assets and inventories across different platforms without having to start over. This holds true for identity & in-game achievements as well. This really only works when the game is built entirely on-chain \n \n* **Trustless relationships between players** that conceal strategy and/or protect identity. Zero knowledge technology will be incredibly powerful in enabling these use cases \n \n* **Complete storage of game logic and state on-chain**, removing persistent reliance on developers and creating total transparency around the equality of rules and accomplishments \n \n* Users can shape (and profit from) the direction of games through ***governance or direct economic ownership***\n\n\n* Player inventories and identities become **durable yet dynamic assets** as they experience upgrades or depreciation \n \n* **Games that exist in perpetuity**, free from the constant threat that developers might shut off access \n \n\n**Another component concerns the construction of games:**\n\n* By building games entirely on-chain, **the creativity of users becomes an asset** in itself as players can use open-source game logic and state to build extensions that capture aspects unique to their culture or real-world experiences \n \n* Rather than AAA game developers trying to interpret and incorporate local themes, **players are empowered to organically design personalized environments** that are infinitely more meaningful by leveraging on-chain primitives \n \n* The Atari 2600 encouraged third-party developers around the world to build new games by making the technological (and capital) hurdle minimal \n \n* Importantly, blockchains also provide a mechanism by which ***creators of user generated content can own their work***\n\n\n* Using open-source, interoperable software to tear down the walls that AAA studios have built up will ***set the stage for incredible creativity to flourish around the world \n ***\n\n  This version of reality makes winners out of us all \n \n\n> ## Expanding the Definition:\n\nAnother reason for infinite optimism concerns who gamers will be and what gaming will mean.\n\n**The rise of the mobile phone marked a critical turning point in bringing gaming to an exponentially larger audience**: grandparents and children; teachers and athletes; artists and mathematicians.\n\nThe “what” changed as well.\n\nSophisticated storylines gave way to simple contests like puzzles, spelling bees, chopping fruit, and launching birds.\n\n**We’re likely to see that trend continue, with blockchains expanding deep into the domain of classrooms, board meetings, corporate training, sporting events, identity cultivation, and more.**\n\nThe interoperable and composable nature of truly crypto-native games will see **a wide range of opportunities for diverse individuals to contribute**: clothing designers who can build skins and outfits for open world environments; graphic designers who can craft remarkable new digital realities; musicians who can incorporate their songs into games, etc.\n\n* ***In an ideal world, the sustainable economies of Web3 games will center on organic user generated value, rather than utility tokens designed to inflate to infinity***\n\n\n* ***Blockchain enabled gaming may well prove to be the reserve currency that connects our world through shared, immersive cultural experiences \n ***\n\n> ## Ultimately…\n\nWe’re likely to see hybrid experiments play out in the immediate term. Building compelling games entirely on-chain remains a significant technical challenge, so we can expect **continued innovation around games that primarily live off-chain.**\n\nFurther, expect to see sustained creativity around the question of efficiently recording state changes on-chain while preserving true decentralization and efficient performance.\n\n**Supporting infrastructure will be a particularly exciting field in the coming years:**\n\n* **Cross-game NFT marketplaces**\n* **Interoperability stacks**\n* **Identity primitives derived from in-game activity**\n* **Franchise discovery platforms**\n* **Low-code tooling** / **SDKs**\n* **On/off ramps and specialized wallets**\n\nWhile a number of very talented developer teams are trying to design rich gaming experiences in Web3 native fashion, it may ultimately be that we see **a continuation of the trend of social and peripheral experiences outweighing the importance of deep storylines and stunning graphics.**\n\nIf this proves to the case, however, the on-chain social layer will need to improve drastically. Yields simply aren’t enough to build a sustainable ecosystem of participants.\n\n*The decentralized future is incredible exciting, but we’ll only realize its full potential by building a world for everyone, by everyone.*\n\n* ***History teaches us that the creation of a new technological primitive, when combined with innate human behavior, leads to incredible value creation, with gaming perhaps the most fundamental example of them all***\n\n\n* ***Gaming is a universal experience codified into our brains across millennia of social interactions***\n\n\n* ***We’ve previously explored how the crypto revolution represents a reversion to the earliest principles underpinning human commerce. It’s therefore only natural that one its biggest unlocks sees us return to the roots of our very nature***", "timestamp": 1658176009, "digest": "bp3BQw3P3v0GdVwRoyJ3Z_34_c9RQYYk-xnL8bKhv1Q", "contributor": "0x3385070c3A310a9756BD0C2FfE8B6AdbAd4Ec4f6"}

The activity was of immense societal importance, incorporated in rituals and used to resolve conflicts or even war.\n\nThis era also saw Ancient China develop Wei Qi — known today as Go — originally used to practice and refine strategic thinking.

The following year, he and his colleagues at Sanders Associates invented a prototype system known as “The Black Box” — the first multiplayer console video game system, initially licensed under the name of “Magnavox Odyssey.”\n\n> ***This is an important point in the nature of technology: the creation of a new primitive (in this case, televisions) combines with an existing human behavior (gaming) to unlock a universe of new possibilities***\n\nThe Odyssey would soon inspire its competitor Atari to launch its own video game in 1972/3, initially an arcade video game called Pong that would later be turned into a version playable at home.\n\n> ***Both the history and future of gaming are underpinned by social connections: yesterday’s arcades will be tomorrow’s metaverse***\n\n## *Leveling Up with Composability:*\n\nAtari broke new ground in 1977 by launching the Atari 2600 VCS that allowed users to switch out game cartridges via an external ROM slot. Though Atari built dozens of games themselves, their creation of generalizable gaming hardware allowed third-party programmers across the globe to design their own games for the console.\n\nOther novel features included levels with increasing difficulty, scoring systems, and leaderboards, setting the stage for the communities that would soon form around games themselves.\n\n## *New Entrants:*\n\nAn intense wave of consumer demand, fueled by the launch of massively popular games like Space Invaders, was followed by a crash in the industry as excessive hype led to an oversupply of cheap games.\n\nThe crash wouldn’t last long, however, as a new (yet very old) powerhouse would rise from the East. Nintendo, founded in 1889 as a manufacturer of playing cards, launched a number of titles in the early 1980s that would shape the industry forever, including Donkey Kong, Mario Bros., Zelda, and other major titles.\n\nNintendo also launched its own console: the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), featuring significant technological improvements relative to its existing peers.\n\nIn 1989, Nintendo made history once more by releasing the first handheld Game Boy – **forever transforming the world of gaming and** **setting the stage for the mobile revolution that would come many years later**.\n\nAs we’ll explore later, gaming’s biggest domain has shifted to mobile, paying homage to one of its earliest and most important innovations.\n\n> ***Consoles were never the endgame — they were the intermediate medium while the hardware and software caught up during a long period of intense development***\n\n## *Upgrading the Stack:*\n\nThe console wars of the 1990s saw companies like Sega, Nintendo, and Sony battle for dominance as they leveraged a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem to develop increasingly sophisticated consoles and game franchises.\n\n> **The technological explosion that engulfed the world in the ’80s and ’90s saw computers enter millions of homes**\n\nThe tremendous increase in computing power allowed developers to supercharge their efforts, leading to the dawn of three-dimensional gaming experiences and online play.\n\nAs more homes came online, LAN parties became extremely popular, with players meeting up in person to compete by connecting to the local network.\n\nThe 2000’s saw a new era of console wars, this time between Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation), and Nintendo (Wii), **with** **competition centering on graphics, quality of storyline, and, eventually, the online gaming experience**. Marketplaces sprung up, allowing users to purchase titles or downloadable content, upgrade software, and communicate with other players.\n\nAdvanced open world games with simulated autonomous characters also became extremely popular as a predecessor to the digital metaverse boom we’re seeing today.\n\nPC-based MMORPGs became a global phenomenon in their own right, competing less on graphics or story and more on community, digital identity, and portability.\n\n> ***The explosion in PC gaming offered a glimpse of what billions of users would ultimately prioritize in their gaming experiences***\n\n## *Going Mobile:*\n\nDecreasing computing and hardware costs allowed the global gaming audience to grow exponentially over the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n**Just as the prevalence of personal computers provided a new medium for the industry to expand into, so too did the billions of mobile phones produced in the late 2000s and early 2010s offer a new route for adoption.**\n\nMobile gaming continued where PC-based gaming left off, prioritizing experiences that offered portability, simplicity, and community interaction.\n\n**The rise of mobile phones as the primary computing hardware used by billions of people saw the gaming demographic expand into casual players of all ages, with low-cost games spinning up to meet every user profile.**\n\nThe market for mobile games was worth \\~$120B in 2021 and is expected to triple over the next decade as the computing stack gets even better.\n\n> ***As with TVs before, the mobile transformation offers further proof of a recurring historical pattern: technological infrastructure introduced for one purpose tends to unlock astonishing value across myriad others***\n\n> ***Blockchains will likely end up underpinning trillions in value across cultural and social use cases we have yet to imagine, extending well beyond the initial applications in decentralized finance***\n\n## *Beyond Gaming:*\n\nJust as the demographic has expanded tremendously over gaming’s first few decades, so too has its very meaning.\n\n**Two critical developments took place in the late 2010s:**\n\n**1) The ability to integrate real world culture into the game itself**\n\n**2) The creation of in-game economies for digital assets**\n\nFranchises like Fortnite were early pioneers in recognizing that online gaming was as much about the competition as it was about expressing social identity and connecting over cultural movements in an open, digital environment.\n\n> ***The industry’s life cycle has seen a steady convergence of social interactions and traditional gaming, with the former seemingly on track to eventually eclipse the latter in importance***\n\n> ***Ultimately, Fortnite and others have become enablers of a new world in which the peripheral gaming experience often matters most: video streaming, chat, digital cosmetics, microtransactions, etc***\n\n## *Decentralizing Web2:*\n\nThe rise of Roblox — a platform facilitating and hosting user-created games — represents another major industry development. Roblox boasts an incredible \\~200M monthly active users, with over 70% of user sessions taking place on mobile devices.\n\n**Just as YouTube broke ground by making video content creation open to everyone, Roblox has turned players into builders (though most users are still only players).**\n\nRoblox includes its own in-game currency (Robux) that players can use to purchase items in its digital economy.\n\nThe Steam Deck is another fascinating development.\n\nBuilt on an open-source operating system (Linux), the Steam Deck offers cross-platform capabilities for players to access games from a range of developers, as well as older games using emulation software.\n\n**The rise of Cloud Gaming is another emerging trend making gaming accessible to everyone.**\n\nNow, players don’t need to invest in expensive hardware to access incredible games anywhere in the world.\n\n> ***These colossal themes playing out are a major reason why Web3 makes sense as the logical successor domain for gaming: the ideological alignment is extraordinary***\n>\n> ***The shift away from expensive hardware and closed ecosystems, the proliferation of a rich social layer, and the quest for creative ownership are inevitably driving the industry towards a blockchain-enabled future***\n\n## *Play to Earn:*\n\nThe blockchain revolution naturally started with financial applications, given the original purpose of Bitcoin itself was to create a peer-to-peer decentralized transaction system. So it shouldn’t be surprising that the tactics that worked early on in DeFi were soon applied to the world of Web3 gaming.\n\n> **In particular, two areas saw the most significant amount of early adoption:**\n\n* **Blockchain-enabled marketplaces for in-game digital assets \n **\n* **Native gaming tokens that had in-game utility but more importantly served to reward early players**\n\nHowever, most of crypto’s early games have largely been built off-chain, with only the digital economies themselves (exchange and settlement) taking place on-chain.\n\n> **Ultimately, these games crashed back to earth due to a few key problems:**\n\n* **Terrible gaming experiences centered on yield generation, inevitably attracting short term mercenaries \n **\n* **Poorly thought-out economies with native governance and utility tokens effectively programmed to go to zero \n **\n* **Closed-wall infrastructure that is neither composable nor interoperable**\n\n## *Where We’ve Fallen Short:*\n\nThe approach to date has essentially been to **take DeFi and build narratives with prehistoric graphics and storylines on top of it**. Predictably, this approach fell into a dangerous purgatory, having failed to attract serious players or even durable traders.\n\n> **The next phase of Web3 gaming is gravitating towards improved graphics and storylines, as well as better economic design**\n\nThis new route won’t be a walk in the park either.\n\nBy competing on the DeFi front, games were effectively fighting for attention using yield. This strategy was nearsighted but admittedly worked in a market that could only go up.\n\n> **By making graphics and storylines the new industry battleground, Web3 developers are taking on the traditional AAA studios who have an extraordinary head start.**\n\nMore importantly, truly crypto-native solutions are less likely to get built this way. This approach feels a lot more like the late ’90s equivalent of taking every business and throwing “.com” in front of it.\n\n**Builders need to be wary of forcing crypto rails into unnatural use cases.**\n\nThe other issue lies in making gaming an asset-based experience at its core, rather than a social one. By doing so, we create barriers to entry that can be exploited by developers, guilds, speculators, and other potentially malicious actors, thereby derailing crypto’s mission to empower the world.\n\n> ***If crypto-native developers want to win, they need to battle on home ground and on their own terms. Trying to beat the incumbents at their own game is a very challenging (and resource intensive) strategy***\n\n## *Building On Crypto’s Unfair Advantage:*\n\nThe true renaissance will occur as we start leveraging crypto rails to redefine what gaming looks like.\n\n> ***Part of that centers on the gaming experience:***\n\n* **Interoperability across games** so that players can transport their assets and inventories across different platforms without having to start over. This holds true for identity & in-game achievements as well \n \n* **Trustless relationships between players** that conceal strategy and/or protect identity.

Nintendo, founded in 1889 as a manufacturer of playing cards, launched a number of titles in the early 1980s that would shape the industry forever, including Donkey Kong, Mario Bros., Zelda, and other major titles.\n\nNintendo also launched its own console: the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), featuring significant technological improvements relative to its existing peers.\n\nIn 1989, Nintendo made history once more by releasing the first handheld Game Boy – **forever transforming the world of gaming and** **setting the stage for the mobile revolution that would come many years later**.\n\nAs we’ll explore later, gaming’s biggest domain has shifted to mobile, paying homage to one of its earliest and most important innovations.\n\n> ***Consoles were never the endgame — they were the intermediate medium while the hardware and software caught up during a long period of intense development***\n\n## *Upgrading the Stack:*\n\nThe console wars of the 1990s saw companies like Sega, Nintendo, and Sony battle for dominance as they leveraged a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem to develop increasingly sophisticated consoles and game franchises.\n\n> **The technological explosion that engulfed the world in the ’80s and ’90s saw computers enter millions of homes**\n\nThe tremendous increase in computing power allowed developers to supercharge their efforts, leading to the dawn of three-dimensional gaming experiences and online play.\n\nAs more homes came online, LAN parties became extremely popular, with players meeting up in person to compete by connecting to the local network.\n\nThe 2000’s saw a new era of console wars, this time between Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation), and Nintendo (Wii), **with** **competition centering on graphics, quality of storyline, and, eventually, the online gaming experience**. Marketplaces sprung up, allowing users to purchase titles or downloadable content, upgrade software, and communicate with other players.\n\nAdvanced open world games with simulated autonomous characters also became extremely popular as a predecessor to the digital metaverse boom we’re seeing today.\n\nPC-based MMORPGs became a global phenomenon in their own right, competing less on graphics or story and more on community, digital identity, and portability.\n\n> ***The explosion in PC gaming offered a glimpse of what billions of users would ultimately prioritize in their gaming experiences***\n\n## *Going Mobile:*\n\nDecreasing computing and hardware costs allowed the global gaming audience to grow exponentially over the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n**Just as the prevalence of personal computers provided a new medium for the industry to expand into, so too did the billions of mobile phones produced in the late 2000s and early 2010s offer a new route for adoption.**\n\nMobile gaming continued where PC-based gaming left off, prioritizing experiences that offered portability, simplicity, and community interaction.\n\n**The rise of mobile phones as the primary computing hardware used by billions of people saw the gaming demographic expand into casual players of all ages, with low-cost games spinning up to meet every user profile.**\n\nThe market for mobile games was worth \\~$120B in 2021 and is expected to triple over the next decade as the computing stack gets even better.\n\n> ***As with TVs before, the mobile transformation offers further proof of a recurring historical pattern: technological infrastructure introduced for one purpose tends to unlock astonishing value across myriad others***\n\n> ***Blockchains will likely end up underpinning trillions in value across cultural and social use cases we have yet to imagine, extending well beyond the initial applications in decentralized finance***\n\n## *Beyond Gaming:*\n\nJust as the demographic has expanded tremendously over gaming’s first few decades, so too has its very meaning.\n\n**Two critical developments took place in the late 2010s:**\n\n**1) The ability to integrate real world culture into the game itself**\n\n**2) The creation of in-game economies for digital assets**\n\nFranchises like Fortnite were early pioneers in recognizing that online gaming was as much about the competition as it was about expressing social identity and connecting over cultural movements in an open, digital environment.\n\n> ***The industry’s life cycle has seen a steady convergence of social interactions and traditional gaming, with the former seemingly on track to eventually eclipse the latter in importance***\n\n> ***Ultimately, Fortnite and others have become enablers of a new world in which the peripheral gaming experience often matters most: video streaming, chat, digital cosmetics, microtransactions, etc***\n\n## *Decentralizing Web2:*\n\nThe rise of Roblox — a platform facilitating and hosting user-created games — represents another major industry development. Roblox boasts an incredible \\~200M monthly active users, with over 70% of user sessions taking place on mobile devices.\n\n**Just as YouTube broke ground by making video content creation open to everyone, Roblox has turned players into builders (though most users are still only players).**\n\nRoblox includes its own in-game currency (Robux) that players can use to purchase items in its digital economy.\n\nThe Steam Deck is another fascinating development.\n\nBuilt on an open-source operating system (Linux), the Steam Deck offers cross-platform capabilities for players to access games from a range of developers, as well as older games using emulation software.\n\n**The rise of Cloud Gaming is another emerging trend making gaming accessible to everyone.**\n\nNow, players don’t need to invest in expensive hardware to access incredible games anywhere in the world.\n\n> ***These colossal themes playing out are a major reason why Web3 makes sense as the logical successor domain for gaming: the ideological alignment is extraordinary***\n>\n> ***The shift away from expensive hardware and closed ecosystems, the proliferation of a rich social layer, and the quest for creative ownership are inevitably driving the industry towards a blockchain-enabled future***\n\n## *Play to Earn:*\n\nThe blockchain revolution naturally started with financial applications, given the original purpose of Bitcoin itself was to create a peer-to-peer decentralized transaction system. So it shouldn’t be surprising that the tactics that worked early on in DeFi were soon applied to the world of Web3 gaming.\n\n> **In particular, two areas saw the most significant amount of early adoption:**\n\n* **Blockchain-enabled marketplaces for in-game digital assets \n **\n* **Native gaming tokens that had in-game utility but more importantly served to reward early players**\n\nHowever, most of crypto’s early games have largely been built off-chain, with only the digital economies themselves (exchange and settlement) taking place on-chain.\n\n> **Ultimately, these games crashed back to earth due to a few key problems:**\n\n* **Terrible gaming experiences centered on yield generation, inevitably attracting short term mercenaries \n **\n* **Poorly thought-out economies with native governance and utility tokens effectively programmed to go to zero \n **\n* **Closed-wall infrastructure that is neither composable nor interoperable**\n\n## *Where We’ve Fallen Short:*\n\nThe approach to date has essentially been to **take DeFi and build narratives with prehistoric graphics and storylines on top of it**. Predictably, this approach fell into a dangerous purgatory, having failed to attract serious players or even durable traders.\n\n> **The next phase of Web3 gaming is gravitating towards improved graphics and storylines, as well as better economic design**\n\nThis new route won’t be a walk in the park either.\n\nBy competing on the DeFi front, games were effectively fighting for attention using yield. This strategy was nearsighted but admittedly worked in a market that could only go up.\n\n> **By making graphics and storylines the new industry battleground, Web3 developers are taking on the traditional AAA studios who have an extraordinary head start.**\n\nMore importantly, truly crypto-native solutions are less likely to get built this way. This approach feels a lot more like the late ’90s equivalent of taking every business and throwing “.com” in front of it.\n\n**Builders need to be wary of forcing crypto rails into unnatural use cases.**\n\nThe other issue lies in making gaming an asset-based experience at its core, rather than a social one. By doing so, we create barriers to entry that can be exploited by developers, guilds, speculators, and other potentially malicious actors, thereby derailing crypto’s mission to empower the world.\n\n> ***If crypto-native developers want to win, they need to battle on home ground and on their own terms. Trying to beat the incumbents at their own game is a very challenging (and resource intensive) strategy***\n\n## *Building On Crypto’s Unfair Advantage:*\n\nThe true renaissance will occur as we start leveraging crypto rails to redefine what gaming looks like.\n\n> ***Part of that centers on the gaming experience:***\n\n* **Interoperability across games** so that players can transport their assets and inventories across different platforms without having to start over. This holds true for identity & in-game achievements as well \n \n* **Trustless relationships between players** that conceal strategy and/or protect identity. Zero knowledge technology will be incredibly powerful in enabling these use cases \n \n* **Complete storage of game logic and state on-chain**, removing persistent reliance on developers and creating total transparency around the equality of rules and accomplishments \n \n* Users can shape (and profit from) the direction of games through **governance or direct economic ownership \n **\n* Player inventories and identities become **durable yet dynamic assets** as they experience upgrades or depreciation \n \n* **Games that exist in perpetuity**, free from the constant threat that developers might shut off access\n\n> ***Another component concerns the construction of games:***\n\n* By building games entirely on-chain, **the creativity of users becomes an asset** in itself as players can use open-source game logic and state to build extensions that capture aspects unique to their culture or real-world experiences \n \n* Rather than AAA game developers trying to interpret and incorporate local themes, **players are empowered to organically design personalized environments** that are infinitely more meaningful by leveraging on-chain primitives \n \n* The Atari 2600 encouraged third-party developers around the world to build new games by making the technological (and capital) hurdle minimal \n \n* Importantly, blockchains also provide a mechanism by which **creators of user generated content can own their work** \n \n* Using open-source, interoperable software to tear down the walls that AAA studios have built up will **set the stage for incredible creativity to flourish around the world.**\n\nThis version of reality makes winners out of us all\n\n## *Expanding the Definition:*\n\nAnother reason for infinite optimism concerns who gamers will be and what gaming will mean.\n\n**The rise of the mobile phone marked a critical turning point in bringing gaming to an exponentially larger audience**: grandparents and children; teachers and athletes; artists and mathematicians.\n\n**The “what” changed as well.**\n\nSophisticated storylines gave way to simple contests like puzzles, spelling bees, chopping fruit, and launching birds.\n\n**We’re likely to see that trend continue, with blockchains expanding deep into the domain of classrooms, board meetings, corporate training, sporting events, identity cultivation, and more.**\n\nThe interoperable and composable nature of truly crypto-native games will see a **wide range of opportunities for diverse individuals to contribute**\n\nClothing designers who can build skins and outfits for open world environments; graphic designers who can craft remarkable new digital realities; musicians who can incorporate their songs into games, etc.\n\n> ***In an ideal world, the sustainable economies of Web3 games will center on organic user generated value, rather than utility tokens designed to inflate to infinity***\n>\n> ***Blockchain enabled gaming may well prove to be the reserve currency that connects our world through shared, immersive cultural experiences***\n\n## *Ultimately…*\n\nWe’re likely to see hybrid experiments play out in the immediate term. Building compelling games entirely on-chain remains a significant technical challenge, so we can expect **continued innovation around games that primarily live off-chain.**\n\nFurther, expect to see sustained creativity around the question of **efficiently recording state changes on-chain** while preserving true decentralization and efficient performance.\n\n> **Supporting infrastructure will be a particularly exciting field in the coming years:**\n\n* **Cross-game NFT marketplaces**\n* **Interoperability stacks**\n* **Identity primitives derived from in-game activity**\n* **Franchise discovery platforms**\n* **Low-code tooling** / **SDKs**\n* **On/off ramps and specialized wallets**\n\n**While a number of very talented developer teams are trying to design rich gaming experiences in Web3 native fashion, it may ultimately be that we see a continuation of the trend of social and peripheral experiences outweighing the importance of deep storylines and stunning graphics.**\n\nIf this proves to the case, however, the on-chain social layer will need to improve drastically. Yields simply aren’t enough to build a sustainable ecosystem of participants.\n\nThe decentralized future is incredible exciting, but we’ll only realize its full potential by building a world for everyone, by everyone.\n\n> ***History teaches us that the creation of a new technological primitive, when combined with innate human behavior, leads to incredible value creation, with gaming perhaps the most fundamental example of them all***\n>\n> ***Gaming is a universal experience codified into our brains across millennia of social interactions***\n>\n> ***[We’ve previously explored how the crypto revolution represents a reversion to the earliest principles underpinning human commerce.](https://mirror.xyz/byzantineghost.eth/ompQ7hLHnenMTHcj9tHx18Y_UcUBVKDEmxh0HlOFrh4)***\n>\n> **It’s therefore only natural that one its biggest unlocks sees us return to the roots of our very nature**", "timestamp": 1658177525, "digest": "BX5cHouRWoLR7YNzvt4W0fjvLfvrIEKkdQp-ZbUTjvo", "contributor": "0x3385070c3A310a9756BD0C2FfE8B6AdbAd4Ec4f6"}

Therefore, most of our efforts to raise the floor price would be in vain, because at the slightest opportunity for profit, these bots would put the Skribbles they have minted up for sale. This would make it long and exhausting to get the floor price of our collection to increase.\n\nSecondly, the collection we’re currently working on has a completely different artistic direction. Therefore, we have to adapt our identity with this new collection for consistency and to avoid confusing newcomers. That's why we are going to reorganize our networks, our website, and our branding in general. The Skribbles will remain the backbone of our ecosystem until the mint of our new collection.\n\nFinally, we have real ambitions for this new project. We want it to bring tangible utility to its holders. This is why it is essential to raise funds. This would allow us to hire more staff and alphas callers, create large-scale partnerships with big projects and simply continue to pursue the creation of great opportunities for our holders.\n\nDon't worry — the collection will remain completely free to all Skribbles holders who meet the eligibility requirements.\n\n**Step 2 - The Free Mint (For Skribbles Holders Only)**\n\nOnce we have redesigned our entire branding, and recruited all the people we need to get our second collection off the ground, we will start to communicate with the world, launch partnerships with other projects and distribute whitelists to the most active and engaged members.\n\nStarting in mid-August, we will do our maximum to develop the community as well as to finish the collection we are working on.\n\nThe free mint will take place around mid-September.\n\nWe will reserve 1444 NFTs for our existing community, namely the Skribbles holders and those who have been hand selected to be part of the adventure due to their implication in the project.\n\nBy the way, we will reveal the name of the collection and the first sneak peeks soon.\n\n**Step 3 - The Public Sale**\n\nThere will be a public sale for the rest of the supply. We plan to supply a maximum of 4444 NFTs in total for this new collection. So to sum up, 1444 for the Skribbles holders and 3000 for the public sale. We think it is healthier to have a smaller supply. The price has yet to be defined.\n\nThe public sale will take place two weeks after the free mint, by the end of September.\n\nThe time between the free mint and the public sale will be crucial. This will be the time to act as a close-knit community and all together keep our floor high as well as raise the hype around our project.\n\nThis time, we'll do everything we can to prevent bots from being part of the public sale. We will use Premint or a similar service to make a raffle with a minimum requirements to limit the possibility of bots entering our collection.\n\n**Step 4 - The Beginning**\n\nWe want to make this new collection a real brand, we want to organize events, become a private and exclusive circle with the best alpha callers in the business, continue to partner with the biggest NFTs projects as well as brands, but most of all, we want to send you incredible new collections totally free - for all holders.\n\nBecause after all, we are creative, artists and that's why we got into NFTs. To make beautiful stuff and to have fun. One thing is for sure, we want to continuously improve the quality of the art of the collections we will create in the future.\n\nWe will continue to update this roadmap over time so you can continue to see what we are working on and what our plans are.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article.\n\nYou can't imagine how much we appreciate your presence and support.\n\n— The Skribble Team", "timestamp": 1658179527, "digest": "HmyOB9Dj3TvSsZVxfhEGAsz1L9x4aP4ZPZARo9ObovE", "contributor": "0xf637f28A4Deaf104D22d1468B4d18CadA38eBE8c"}

{"id": "Ta_W6-940Unqx0oXSlYXYxWUh0YsKVcAgavMLzntOPc", "title": "Gnosis Multisig - czym jest, gdzie ma zastosowanie. I czy można na tym przy okazji coś zarobić?", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m6F768_B8zWA_YwrQ0o88.jpg?height=1935&width=3571)\n\n> **Technologia Multisig**, wychodzi z założenia, że trzymanie środków na jednym kluczu to niezbyt bezpieczne rozwiązanie. Multisig zamiast jednego klucza prywatnego, proponuje kilka jednocześnie. Aby wypłacić środki z multisiga potrzeba podpisów z kilku walletów *(w zależności ile dodaliśmy podczas otwierania multisiga)*. **Przykład** \\*- tworzymy \\*multisiga **3/5** oznacza to, że aby wypłacić assety potrzeba **3 z 5 podpisów**.W tym  przypadku gdy w jakiś sposób utracimy 1 lub 2 klucze, nadal będziemy w stanie odzyskać środki, ponieważ mamy dostęp do 3 pozostałych kluczy a w naszej konfiguracji to (3/5) to wystarczy na dokonanie transakcji. Zastosowań jest tutaj dużo. Opiszę kilka z nich. Najpopularniejszy i moim zdaniem najbezpieczniejszy Multisig to GnosisSafe. Co nie oznacza, że nie ma innych. Jest i to całkiem sporo. BitGo, Coinbase, Armory, DarkWallet & GreenAddress.\n\n## Zastosowań jest wiele. Dziś opiszę #4 najpopularniejsze:\n\n1️⃣ **Fundusze VC & Grupy** wspólnie inwestujące w **private sale czy seedy**.Ten przykład będzie bardziej przyziemny z większym utility jeżeli chodzi o moją grupę docelową, dla której piszę ten artykuł. Wyobraź sobie, że masz grupę discordową. Nikt nikogo nie zna w realu, znacie się tylko z avatarów. Chcecie zainwestować w projekt, jednak próg wejścia to **$25K,** a więc trzeba połączyć siły i zainwestować wspólnie. Problemem jest kto będzie posiadaczem głównego walletu, na który będą wpadać tokeny z inwestycji czy środki ze zbiórki. I tutaj rozwiązaniem jest multisig. Przykładu chyba nie muszę opisywać co? W skrócie macie np 20osób w grupie. Tworzycie multisig 7/12 i podpisy należą dla najbardziej zaufanych i zasłużonych członków grupy. Tutaj opcji jest wiele. W tym temacie jest jedno zagrożenie. Więc żeby nie było HOPIUM to opiszę nasz własny case. Zainwestowaliśmy w projekt poprzez multisig. Podczas dystrybucji tokenów - **zonk! Gnosis Multisig** nie jest kompatybilny z metamaskiem jeżeli chodzi o główny kontrakt multisig. Adres ten był podany w umowie jako ‘odbiór tokenów’. Same wallety do podpisów multisiga są jak najbardziej kompatybilne z metamask. Można nimi podpisywać transakcje jednak sam kontrakt multisig tej kompatybilności z metamask nie ma. Po listingu, dostaliśmy stronę, na której był claim zakupionych tokenów. I tu pojawił się problem, ponieważ na stronie do claimowania był tylko metamask, którego nie obsługiwał gnosis 🤯 Długo szukaliśmy rozwiązania i docelowo się udało. Claimu dokonałem poprzez wywołanie transakcji manualnie. Tutaj jednak potrzebna wiedza techniczna i kod od twórców projektu. Śliski temat, ale mi się udało! 👏 Z wysłaniem tokenów z multisiga na giełdę czy inny wallet już nie było problemu, do tego są potrzebne podpisy (metamask). **Jaką lekcje z tego wyciągneliśmy ?** Przed inwestycją w projekt poprzez multisig należy pytać projektu, czy tokeny będą do nas wysłane, czy będziemy musieli je sami claimować. Jeśli opcja numer 2 to słabo i tutaj raczej nie używałbym multisiga!\n\n2️⃣ **Cyber-ataki na giełdy.** Potencjalny haker, łamiąc zabezpieczenia np. CEXA, wejdzie w posiadanie tylko pojedynczego klucza. Do wyciągnięcia środków giełdy często stosują kilka podpisów, więc wyciągnięcie środków często jest niemożliwe. Dodatkowo istnieje możliwość zabezpieczenia multisiga poprzez 2FA co czyni atak jeszcze bardziej trudnym.\n\n3️⃣ **Zabezpieczenie płatności w darknecie** *\\[escrow\\]* . Wiadomo na darknecie bardzo ciężko o zaufanie płacąc za towar/usugę osobie, której nie znamy. A więc dzięki multisigowi można ograniczyć ryzyko z tym związane. Serwisy czy marketplace oferują swojego zaufanego *depozytariusza,* który jest pośrednikiem w tranacakcji. Z jednej strony jesteś ty jako *kupujący.* Po drugiej stronie jest sprzedający, a pomiędzy *depozytariusz,* który rozwiązuje dany spór jeśli do takiego by doszło. Jeśli transakcja odbywa się bez żadnych komplikacji, obie jej strony *kupujący i sprzedający* realizują płatność z wykorzystaniem posiadanych przez siebie kluczy. Tutaj najpopularniejszą konfiguracją jest 3 z 3 kluczy. W przypadku problemów z realizacją transakcji *depozytariusz* rozstrzyga, kto ma racje. Gdy obie strony dochodzą do porozumienia i są happy z transakcji to stroną trzecia dokonuje  dostatniego podpisu, po czym transakcja przechodzi.\n\nPosłużę się tutaj prostym przykładem. W transakcji biorą udział 3 strony: sprzedający, kupujący i depozytariusz. W momencie dokonywania deala, system generuje adres multisigowy. Każda ze stron dodaje swój klucz prywatny po czym otrzymuje fragment klucza. Kupujący wysyła np ETH na wygenerowany adres multisig. Sprzedający posiadając tylko 1/3 wymaganych kluczy nie może claimować tego assetu. Potwierdzenie przez stronę kupującą, że otrzymał towar/usługę powoduje 2 podpis. W przypadku sporu (np. sprzedawca twierdzi, że wysłał towar, lecz kupujący nie potwierdza otrzymania towaru) to depozytariusz decyduje komu przekazać swój klucz. Jeżeli depozytariusz uzna, że sprzedawca nie wysłał towaru. Nie ma potwierdzenia wysyłki lub wysłał kupe,  to klucz przekazywany jest kupującemu i odzyskuje on swoje pieniądze. Tacy depozytariusze dbają też o swoją renomę, zbierają feedbacki i trust. W przeciwnym wypadku klucz trafia do sprzedającego i otrzymuje on asset za tą usługę. Ma to sens co? Tyle teorii, na koniec dodam, że w praktyce działa to bardzo fajnie. Chociażby na naszej polskiej cebuli.\n\n4️⃣ **Bezpieczna przystań dla assetów w longterm.** Na koniec jeszcze jeden przykład użycia multisig. Wyobraź sobie, że trzymasz ETH, wBTC, sporo stabli i inne assety. Chcesz to trzymać w longterm i nic z tym nie robić. Jeśli wartość assetów jest spora tutaj też przychodzi z rozwiązaniem multisig. Trzymając te wszystkie assety na jednym wallecie, tracąc dostęp czy padając ofiarą hacku tracimy wszystko. Wystarczy, że ktoś wykradnie twój klucz prywatny czy seed. Aby się zabezpieczyć, można tutaj użyć multisig np 2/3 gdzie jednym kluczem byłby wallet z ledgera, drugim z trezora, a trzecim jeszcze coś innego. Aby wypłacić assety z multisiga potrzebujemy w tym przypadku 2z3 kluczy. Więc nawet jak by ktoś zdobył jeden klucz - nie będzie w stanie wypłacić środków!\n\n> Przykładów użycia jest dużo więcej, ale na tym zakończę. Celem tego wpisu jest nie tylko opisanie tego czym jest i jak działa multisig, ale również potencjalna spekulacja. Pamiętasz #airdrop Optimism? Jednym z punktów dla osób, które dostały tego dropa był właśnie multisig. Ci co podpisali jakąś transakcje poprzez multisig dostali **1190 $OP**. Dzisiejsza wartość to około **$1666**. Jako, że z multisiga korzystałem wcześniej, to i udało mi się zakwalifikować!  🦾\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z8a0SCY6fpyPUvD_PDcys.png?height=640&width=1038)\n\n> ### Czy inne projekty, mogą pójść podobną drogą i sypnąć tokenami dla userów, którzy korzystają z tego rozwiązania? Jest na to duża szansa. Multisig na chwilę obecną to nadal wąska grupa, a więc i potencjał na sytego dropa jest wyższy (drop rozmyty na mniejszą ilość wosób)\n\n🚩 Tutaj też, aby nie było tak wesoło — widzę  **zagrożenie** 🧐Wyobraź sobie, że masz hmm 5 walletów, z których korzystasz na co dzień. Robisz więc multisig 3/5 lub 4/5, po czym dokonujesz transakcji, aby zaszła interakcja z kontraktem. Wystawiasz się tym na potencjalnego dropa - super!\n\nZ drugiej strony jednak, adresy te poprzez multisig są w jakimś stopniu ze sobą powiązane. Wiecie, sybil i te sprawy 🙃I tutaj rozkmina. @[0xKubi](https://twitter.com/0xKubi) & @[TomKowalczyk](https://twitter.com/tomkowalczyk) będziemy bardzo wdzięczni za wasz feedback w tym temacie! 🙏\n\n**Pamiętaj, wszyscy jesteśmy tutaj for tech, yeees ser?** Zanim zaczniemy tworzyć i korzystać fajnie by było to dobrze rozkminić. Pomysłów jest kilka. Jeden z nich to stworzenie nowych walletów pod multisiga + jeden z którego korzystamy na co dzień, aby nie linkować. Kolejny to użyć adresy, które używamy na codzień, ale to kwestia do przegadania z bardziej technicznymi osobami. Osobiście będę tworzył kolejnego multisiga, ale nad strukturą cały czas pracuje. Czekam też na tańszy gaz u Vitalika. Fajnie jak by się rozkręciła dyskusja/burza mózgów w tym temacie pod tweetem.\n\n## 🗣 I na koniec instrukcja jak stworzyć multisiga 💭\n\n### \n\n1️⃣ Łączymy portfel na [gnosis-safe.io/app](https://gnosis-safe.io/app)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iCbDNRDMVDrV8krQIWRaf.png?height=893&width=963)\n\n2️⃣ Łączymy portfel podpisujący (np.Metamask). Będzie to też wallet z pierwszym podpisem.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mzXdnKlNeRqnb4In1mf16.png?height=709&width=1925)\n\n3️⃣ Wybieramy wallety do podpisów multisiga. Ten krok jest mega ważny, ponieważ są to adresy, które mają uprawnienia do przesyłania i zatwierdzania transakcji (możesz później usunąć lub zastąpić te adresy). Twój połączony portfel został już dodany jako pierwszy signer, ale możesz go również zmienić. Dodaj dowolną liczbę walletów, wklejając adres Ethereum lub wpisując nazwę ENS.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gkOyOBEqj3xoRuouvw4h6.png?height=1299&width=1697)\n\n4️⃣ Zdefiniuj liczbę potrzebnych walletów do podpisania transakcji zanim zostanie potwierdzona. Pamiętaj, aby dokładnie przemyśleć strukturę! Jeśli nie będziesz mieć dostępu do zdefiniowanej liczby podpisów — **nie będziesz w stanie odzyskać swoich zasobów!** 🚩\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ePQHTQCvAFtvty5dXi2aB.png?height=252&width=607)\n\n5️⃣ Na koniec przejrzyj na spokojnie swoje wallety i parametry multisiga. Jeśli wszystko jest tak jak sobie tego życzysz - postępuj zgodnie z instrukcją i zatwierdź transakcje tworzenia kontraktu multisig.\n\n6️⃣ Po stworzeniu multisiga możesz [TUTAJ](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/welcome) się do niego zalogować swoim walletem podpisującym. Po zalogowaniu zostaniesz przeniesiony do dappsa gdzie możesz zarządzać swoim multisigiem. A wygląda to tak  👇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OYhXy7VmiJKkLGqglYApM.png?height=1054&width=3158)\n\n### 👉 Gnosis oferuje multisig nie tylko na mainecie ale i Polygon, BNB, EnergyWebChain, GnosisChain, Arbitrum, Aurora, Avax, Optimism no i testnety Goerli & Rinkeby 👈\n\nTo by było na tyle.

{"id": "ln3EhXgP-Aveu-mYCoD2V5HRuQbht8XTKtB8AFIgOtI", "title": "From Chicago’s South Side to Tech & Web3: The Journey of a First-Gen Low-Income Mexican-American", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4U-AghG5-knKE5RxeUbC.png?height=551&width=527)\n\nI decided to share my story because I don’t think there are enough stories of youth, who in their attempt to grow up quickly, make costly mistakes, yet still end up with jobs in Investment Banking, Tech, or Venture Capital.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m luckier than a rabbit foot wrapped in a four-leaf clover inside a rainbow. But I’ve also lost family and friends to gang violence, and I don’t take it for granted that I get to wake up every day to do the things I’m able to do.\n\n## From California’s Strawberry Fields to Chicago’s South Side\n\nMy story starts with my Dad coming to the US in search of opportunities outside of his small ranch town in Guanajuato, MX. As an older sibling, he was pulled out of middle school to look after his younger siblings and the family livestock.\n\nHe had greater ambitions for himself and his family, so in his early 20’s, he crossed the border to work in the strawberry fields of California. He worked tirelessly to do a job many Americans wouldn’t dream of doing, and for it he fought deportation every day.\n\nHe’s never been the giving up type (something I’ve inherited from him), and eventually he made his way to the steel factories on Chicago’s South Side. He saved up enough money to bring my mom to the US, and there on the South Side is where I was born and raised.\n\nLike many kids in Chicago, I grew up with gangs. I’ve only begun to understand how that’s shaped my life. Around the neighborhood, we had the Vice Lords, the Latin Kings, the Gangster Disciples (GD’s), and the Latin Dragons. Those names might not mean much to you, but in 2021, there were more than 3,500 shootings and 800 homicides in Chicago, concentrated in neighborhoods like mine, driven by names like those.\n\nGrowing up in these environments, you’re just looking to survive. You do things like avoid certain streets, hide valuables when traveling, always watch your back, and limit time outside after dark. If you’re wondering about crime enforcement, I’ve had a gun pointed at me twice in my life for no reason, once by a gangbanger, and once by a cop.\n\nIt’s hard to focus on schoolwork when this is your normal, but it’s school that helped me change my circumstances. I’ve always had a growth mindset and was able to test into a magnet public high school by the name of Whitney M Young. It required that I take the train four hours every day, but it was my ticket out of the neighborhood.\n\n## High School\n\nAt Whitney Young, I felt safe, which led me to deprioritize school work. I began capitalizing on my newfound freedom by selling mixtapes, designer clothes, iPods, bootleg this, and bootleg that. I started cutting classes, then failed a couple classes, then went to summer school, twice.\n\nEventually my recklessness caught up with me and I was almost expelled. Luckily, the school agreed to a parent-faculty conference before making it final and that meeting changed the course of my life.\n\nAs my parents sat there hearing how the school wanted to kick me out, I glanced over at my Dad and saw tears in his eyes. That image is still burned into my brain. My Dad sacrificed everything for his family, including his own education, and I was throwing it all away in the name of being my own man.\n\nI promised to never again be that selfish, short-sighted, and ungrateful.\n\nIt was too late for me to get into a good college, so I decided to attend a for-profit college that eventually shut down. With that diploma came an eclectic, but intentional career focused on up-leveling.\n\n## Early Career\n\nI started my career as an Assistant Store Manager at Walmart. I spent three months there but quickly realized retail management wasn't for me.\n\nI had been fascinated with Wall Street since high school when I participated in an after school program called Youth About Business. They hosted a Mergers & Acquisitions competition where the finalists traveled to NYC to visit banks and ring the closing bell on the New York Stock Exchange. I was a finalist and that visit opened my eyes to an entirely new world.\n\nI didn’t have the credentials to work in finance, but I was willing to play the long game and found a job at a Charles Schwab call center. It would pay $20,000 less than I was making at Walmart, and that was a lot of money to me. But I decided to take the pay cut since they sponsored employees for their Series 7 and 63 licenses, and that would be the start my career in finance.\n\nDespite passing my licensing exams, it was hard to convince firms to take a chance on me without a fancy degree or network.\n\nI made another bet and took a job with a temp agency in Chicago working in the back-office of Credit Suisse. It was a ten-week assignment and they needed someone with licenses to monitor trades and money movements. It wasn’t glorious work, but I was grateful to be doing it. Once the temp assignment was up, they decided to bring me on full-time and I was officially working in finance.\n\nMy job was in the Private Wealth division helping the MBA interns with admin work so that they could find their first clients. I would check Bloomberg for people who recently sold their business so that the MBA interns could call them to ask if they needed help managing their new riches.\n\nSoon after I caught a big break thanks to my soon-to-be mentor Jeff. Jeff was a Relationship Manager (RM) with an established book of business, and his small team of other RMs managed over $1 billion in client assets. I knew Jeff from casual interactions around the office, but seemingly out of nowhere, he asked me to be on his team so that I could work directly for him and his clients.\n\nAfter a while it became clear that Jeff was an ally, and I’m grateful for him and allies like him that help others up the ladder knowing that their small act of generosity can have an outsized impact. Working for Jeff gave me the confidence to know that I belonged in finance. Not just in a call center or back-office; but as a trader, portfolio advisor, and capital allocator. To this day, I go to Jeff for advice on major life decisions and try my best to elevate others the same way he elevated me.\n\n## Peace Corps\n\nAfter a few years working for Jeff and being around MBAs, business school creeped onto my radar. However, up until that point, I had only lived in the Midwest and needed to see more of the world. So I applied to the Peace Corps, and was assigned to Peru as a Community Economic Development volunteer, a life experience I could not pass up.\n\nFor two years I served as a volunteer in the mountains of Peru with no running water and limited internet. I washed my clothes by hand. I took bucket baths that were warmed by the sun. And I traveled down a treacherous mountain road whenever I needed to submit business school applications.\n\nDuring my service I taught youth entrepreneurship in the local high schools, hosted personal finance workshops for senior citizens, and launched a baseball academy for local boys & girls. It was a life-changing experience that taught me so much about the world and my place in it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3UPLtS4Mt5qk1HF_2V89m.JPG?height=3456&width=4608)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BDxDuMPd3WCSaaqL56Vxf.png?height=1286&width=1816)\n\nMy biggest takeaway was that despite my adversities, as an American, I was incredibly privileged by comparison.\n\nMy other takeaway was that despite being early in my career, I had knowledge and experiences that could positively impact the lives of many. I realized that even if you only learned a week’s worth of something, you can still teach it to someone who is just beginning.\n\n## Business School / Investment Banking\n\nAfter the Peace Corps, I began my MBA journey at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.\n\nI received a full-tuition scholarship thanks to Tuck donors and The Consortium. Without it, the $205,000 price tag would have been too much coming from the Peace Corps.\n\nI owe so much to organizations like The Consortium, Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT), Toigo, and to generous donors who want to see more underrepresented minorities succeed in business school and beyond.\n\nAfter business school, I went into investment banking and worked in New York as an Associate in the Global Industrials Group at Credit Suisse. I did that for a year, gained valuable modeling and valuation skills, developed an incredible network of highly motivated and brilliant individuals, but ultimately left because of the awful lifestyle.\n\n100 hour+ weeks consumed by stress and sleepless nights for work that gets trashed with little to no notice. I went into banking the healthiest I’ve ever been thanks to the flexible MBA student lifestyle, but emerged from banking one year later in the worst shape of my life.\n\nI left banking and began a self-discovery journey to find work that gave me balance and energy.\n\n## Tech / Drift\n\nAfter some reflection, I found myself gravitating towards entrepreneurship and tech. I was familiar with entrepreneurship, but not tech entrepreneurship. In the same vein, I was familiar with finance, but not Venture Capital.\n\nI remember having a hard time understanding what a seed round was. Or why capital raises were called Series A, B, C, etc. Or how a VC could have 9 out of 10 investments fail, yet be successful.\n\nI knew I wanted to be in the Tech ecosystem, but wasn’t sure if as an operator or investor. Ultimately, I thought startup experience would make me a better investor and founder, so I opted for the operator route.\n\nI wanted to work for a Black or Latinx founder since “you can’t be what you can’t see”, and was ecstatic to join Drift, a Latinx-founded B2B SaaS startup that recently became a unicorn.\n\nI got the job thanks to Twitter and a Spanish jingle I wrote for them.\n\n[https://twitter.com/OrlandoGomezzz/status/1337446027494891523?s=20&t=j2GXcWdIJeFEg9ZfIcX8WA](https://twitter.com/OrlandoGomezzz/status/1337446027494891523?s=20&t=j2GXcWdIJeFEg9ZfIcX8WA)\n\nThat jingle was my way of standing out as a candidate and highlighting my creativity. It was either going to peak their interest or get them to block me. Luckily, it was the former.\n\nAt Drift, I’m currently building out the Startups program so that early stage companies have the tools to accelerate revenue and have real conversations with their customers.\n\n## Harlem Capital / Web3 Familia\n\nOutside of Drift, I’ve been able to participate in amazing opportunities such as a VC internship with Harlem Capital. Thanks to them, I learned a ton about tech investing and was able to lean into my skills as a content creator (I also wrote them a jingle lol).\n\nDuring my internship, I saw that Web3 was going to be bigger than I ever imagined. Seeing the sheer number of Web3 deals in the pipeline, and the amount of capital flowing into the capable hands of builders convinced me to go all-in on Web3.\n\nPrior to that, I was a long-time skeptic of crypto. The banks I worked for assured me that crypto was not worth my time, and that it was primarily used to buy pizza and commit crimes.\n\nHowever, what I was seeing with my own eyes at Harlem Capital painted an entirely different picture. This new picture was filled with opportunity and ownership, and I wanted in.\n\nI had recently convinced my parents to invest in the stock market after ten years of struggling to get them comfortable with the idea, and I didn’t want it to be another ten years before they, and other Latinos like them, got comfortable with crypto.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zr4lnUpz9qk5mXxHBJ0nN.PNG?height=500&width=500)\n\nSo in November 2021, I launched Web3 Familia with the mission of onboarding 1 Million Latinos to Web3. It got instant traction and has become a community for Latinos to feel seen, heard, and empowered as Web3 learners and builders. We have since become an Education DAO on the NEAR Protocol and have raised seed capital thanks to NEAR’s DAOcubator program.\n\nWe are just getting started and I’m incredibly bullish on Latinos in Web3. This isn’t just finance or tech. This is the intersection of finance, tech, and culture; and Latinos have culture for days.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nLooking back, my journey has not been a common one, but one common fact has permeated it. The fact that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not.\n\nSo if you’re reading this as someone interested in Web3, Tech, VC, I-Banking, Business School, the Peace Corps, or any other field, just know that you belong in that space just as much as anyone else. You have the skills and talent necessary to achieve anything you set out to achieve. It might not appear that way at first, but don’t give up. Sometimes you have to be the change.\n\n[https://twitter.com/OrlandoGomezzz/status/1425502068027142148?s=20&t=j2GXcWdIJeFEg9ZfIcX8WA](https://twitter.com/OrlandoGomezzz/status/1425502068027142148?s=20&t=j2GXcWdIJeFEg9ZfIcX8WA)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658180281, "digest": "tsXqEIqWoykYnhjRE5cTXvPZQp1vr_etq-nGCwhGM5k", "contributor": "0xDd3C659B4aBB015f05527e8cC69a6424e5Fa1C09"}

Um deles destaca-se pela capacidade de entrega e inovação no desenvolvimento de ferramentas para a comunidade: **a Gnosis DAO**.\n\n## Desenvolvedores Geniais Criam Ferramentas Fundamentais\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SXJHYlidJqA2dzqoRERZz.png?height=700&width=1400)\n\nA Gnosis DAO é uma das organizações mais capitalizadas do cripto-setor: [em seu tesouro repousam U$1.2B](https://openorgs.info/). A riqueza financeira da DAO não é por acaso. Fundada em 2015 como parte de *software* desenvolvido pela Consensys, tornou-se uma empresa independente em 2017 e desenvolveu múltiplas soluções para a indústria cripto.\n\nVamos mostrar a você os principais produtos pela Gnosis e porquê são importantes para o cripto-mercado.\n\n## Tokens Condicionais\n\nOs tokens condicionais funcionam como mercados preditivos.\n\nUsuários competem entre si em apostas de acontecimentos futuros, como eleições presidenciais, quedas de regimes e jogos esportivos. A aplicação pode parecer simples, mas a Gnosis introduziu a monetização tokenizada neste produto, possibilitando investimentos em ativos inimagináveis - e tudo isso a necessidade de KYC ou moedas fiduciárias -.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/72g_oaa4e6vGZ4SXq6nDs.png?height=1998&width=1400)\n\nA Polymarket foi uma das primeiras plataformas a utilizou esta tecnologia como infraestrutura para construir sua própria solução de mercados preditivos, moldando-o ao seu produto e atraindo a atenção de usuários curiosos com a nova aplicação.\n\n## O início das *exchanges descentralizadas* e a proteção a MEV\n\nGradualmente, os desenvolvedores da Gnosis começaram a encontrar outras mazelas na indústria, destacando a ausência de liquidez em *exchanges* descentralizadas.\n\nDeFi estava apenas despertando e a Gnosis sabia da importância em construir infraestruturas para suportar o crescimento dos protocolos.\n\nA 1ª versão da DEX da organização, lançada em 2020, introduziu o conceito de *ring trades,* negociações compactadas em pequenos pacotes e enviadas coletivamente. Essa inovação permitiu aos usuários economizarem em taxas de transações e aumentarem a eficiência de seu capital, maximizando a liquidez para *trades.*\n\n![Exemplo de ring trade implementado na V1 da Gnosis e futura CoW Swap](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RUgcZzr8L3RdS2hW9nc-o.png?height=818&width=1063)\n\nCom o Verão DeFi despontando, aplicações como estas foram essenciais para a comunidade. Muitos de seus conceitos foram importados da CoW Swap, uma DEX desenvolvida por seus programadores em 2018.  O protocolo trouxe funcionalidades específicas, como a proteção a MEV - Miner Extractable Value -.\n\nEscrevemos um texto explicando cada conceito de seu funcionamento e [você pode ler ele aqui.](https://mirror.xyz/foxbrasil.eth/OCJPvUWxnrDg9pG1rQEQ_dC3YxLs69hNtQwLhtYIvs8)\n\nA evolução do ecossistema e a rápida adoção de seus produtos, fez a Gnosis inaugurar a V2 de seu protocolo e descentralizar a CoW Swap, tornando-a uma organização independente da empresa. Os *early adopters* receberam um *airdrop* com o token COW para votarem em propostas na governança e decidir seu futuro.\n\nEnquanto isso, mecanismos semelhantes aos da CoW Swap - proteção a MEV, melhoria na eficiência dos *ring trades* e até uma parceria com a Balancer - foram incluídos na 2ª versão do protocolo da Gnosis.\n\n## Custodiando Bilhões com Gnosis Safe\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3pX2A9aAsLhAsd8jgvhuC.png?height=645&width=1220)\n\nO produto de maior sucesso da Gnosis, sem dúvida alguma, é o [Gnosis Safe.](https://gnosis-safe.io/#getting-started) O protocolo desenvolvido para atuar como cofres para tesouros de DAOs teve larga adoção pela comunidade. A ferramenta para custódia de criptoativos tem [U$40B em seus contratos inteligentes](https://dune.com/safe/ethereum), distribuídos entre milhares de organizações descentralizadas.\n\n![O bull run de 2021 coincide com o crescimento exponencial do capital custodiado nos contratos da Gnosis Safe](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KMd_mzBJ2R1KfGfu8m3TR.png?height=403&width=902)\n\nSua ascensão não veio de repente: lançado em 2019 e em tempos de poucas DAOs, com o *bear market* assolando o mercado, a Gnosis criava uma solução para uma demanda latente atualmente, mas que, na época, ainda dava apenas sinais do que estava por vir.\n\nIntroduzindo as *multisigs* para contribuir com a segurança no armazenamento de criptos, a empresa possibilita a organizações ou grupos guardarem seu capital de maneira mais segura. Ao invés de somente 1 usuários ser capaz de mover os ativos, seus contratos demandam múltiplas assinaturas para conseguir transferi-los de um ponto a outro.\n\nMedidas como essa são fundamentais para manter tesouros de DAOs seguros.\n\nRecentemente, uma proposta na governança da Gnosis DAO - vamos chegar lá - aprovou a descentralização da Gnosis Safe, tornando-a uma organização independente regida por seu novo token de governança, o SAFE.\n\n## A descentralização da Gnosis e o despertar da DAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PmqI3MqPgHdVfsbo7fwOX.png?height=789&width=1400)\n\nComo mostramos para você, a Gnosis é um centro de desenvolvimento para novos produtos. Uma série de aplicações com ótima aceitação por organizações e usuários foram criadas por seus programadores. No entanto, ainda faltava a última peça: a total descentralização.\n\nEm novembro de 2020, a Gnosis anunciou sua conversão em uma Organização Autônoma Descentralizada. Seu token, o GNO, tornou-se um mecanismo para votações na recém-criada da DAO para votações em propostas de sua governança.\n\nEste passo final tomado pelos fundadores da Gnosis, foi uma migração natural para tornarem-se compatíveis com o *ethos* das Finanças Descentralizadas - passo semelhante dado pela ShapeShift DAO em 2021 -.\n\nTem dúvidas sobre as ferramentas da Gnosis DAO? Ou quanto sua utilidade?\n\nVenha para o nosso [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/shapeshift), [Telegram](https://t.me/shapeshiftdaoBR) e/ou [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShapeShiftDAOBR) e lhe ajudaremos com todas elas!\n\n***Autor: [guiriba](https://guilhermebarbosa.substack.com/), copywriter no LatAm Labs da ShapeShift, pesquisador e degen.

{"id": "71ADFTQVFsq3ktUDII3zXiJ6PuNEziPp7zXQALyNTLE", "title": "关于NFT提前从网站获取签名", "body": "这篇文章我觉得很有含金量，哈哈。\n\n最近打的NFT项目，有一些是需要从前端获取签名的。这个时候，市面上大部分的Mint工具都未必能过得了这一关。\n\n我在网上搜索了很多的资料，目前关于提前获取签名的教程几乎没有。科学家们的分享基本上都止步于合约mint、16进制mint等常规的mint方法，这些在我之前的文章里面也有提到。目前基本上来说超过半数的人都会这些mint方法，统称为非网页端mint方法吧。\n\n当一个NFT项目限制了必须要获取前端服务器签名才能mint的时候，大部分人就只能干瞪眼或者老老实实去前端mint了（当然前端大概率是抢不到的）。\n\n首先说下限制前端服务器签名才能mint的原理。这里以ApeDog为例。在合约的mint方法中，加了一个限制条件。\n\n```\nrequire(isAuthorized(sig,digest),\"CONTRACT_MINT_NOT_ALLOWED\");\n```\n\n就是说，每个钱包都需要提供一个签名才能调用mint的方法。这个签名需要从前端网页获取，是由项目方的钱包进行签署的。用户拿着签名去调用合约的mint方法时，合约就会根据签名反推出签名的内容，如果得到的内容（一般就是调用者的地址）是正确的，那么就允许用户进行mint。理论上，签名应该是对调用者的钱包进行签名，这样就不会出现所有人都共用一个签名的伪签名方式。之前有许多项目出现过类似的BUG，后来的人拿到前面人的签名就可以跳过前端直接合约mint。ApeDog这个项目，不光是对调用者的钱包进行了签名，还为每个签名给定了一个有效时间，过了这个有效时间签名就会作废。这个设置挡住了许多提前获取签名的人。\n\n那么前端是如何拿到签名的呢？我们在前端进行mint的时候，一般先连接小狐狸钱包，然后点击mint的按钮，就会跳出小狐狸窗口了，在小狐狸窗口中提交交易即可进行mint。其实在跳出小狐狸窗口的时候，我们看data里面的内容，就已经包含了我们所需要的签名信息了。这是最正规的获取签名的渠道。如果我们想要通过科学家的方式来获取签名的话，首先需要了解前端获取签名的过程。\n\n当我们点击mint按钮的时候，在前端网页就会触发一个event。这个event就会通过一个接口把我们的钱包地址等信息发给后台，后台在收到这些信息后，会调用项目方的钱包对这些信息进行签名，然后返回给前端。这个就是前端获取签名的基本流程。\n\n所以，如果我们不想老老实实的点击mint按钮去获得签名的话，就需要我们自己直接去调用这个接口来和后台进行互动。\n\n调用接口的方式很简单，一般就是两种方法，GET和POST。获取签名的话一般会用POST。调用POST方法的时候，需要输入两个参数，一个是目标url，一个是headers。url就是接口的地址，headers就是我们需要代入的参数。\n\n那么如何获得接口的url地址呢？两种方法，第一个，在前端页面的上通过f12打开开发者模式，在network选项卡中抓包。点击mint按钮后，找到网页对应发送的post请求，在请求中就可以得到我们需要的url了，顺便还能看到我们的headers中包含的参数，一举两得。这种方法的前提是网页要能打得开，一般情况下，比较火爆的项目在发售的时候，前端都会卡的根本没有机会点击mint按钮…\n\n第二种方法的门槛就比较高了，那就是阅读网页的源代码。大部分的NFT项目的源代码都会暴露在网页上，通过开发者模式就可以查看到。通过f12进入开发者模式下，就可以看到网页的js文件。这些js文件可能也是经过了处理，一般可读性都很差…还是以ApeDog项目为例，因为迄今为止我只从它这找到了接口地址。\n\n在apedog.wtf这个目录下只有一个js文件，所以找起来目标就比较明确了。有的项目目录下还有好多文件，找起来就不太好定位了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Pkw6CJycVHvOGjF57vISp.png?height=301&width=304)\n\n点击打开js文件，搜索POST，会出来许多匹配结果。一个一个看一下，看到这里，就需要注意下了。后面跟着一个sigurl。推测这个sigurl就是接口地址。接着搜索sigurl。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XS_BEndjvGRec_vPKxPYs.png?height=526&width=951)\n\n这下就看到了，后面的这个url应该就是我们要找的接口url了。接着看，下面一行还有一个auth，这个一般需要写在headers里面，类似一个授权的东西。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3eZG-wOhqyx_fA_pwEqpz.png?height=548&width=1034)\n\n接着搜索sigurl，看到这个部分。这里有两个参数，一个是sender，应该就是我们的钱包地址了，还有一个Authorization，就是需要我们刚才看到的auth的内容。那么，接下来我们就可以去调用POST方法了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yVu7EqjX_bzOWAV0K5O4X.png?height=523&width=1100)\n\n这里用python的request库。\n\n```\nimport requests\n\nurl = 'https://1-0-0--wen-wl.rekttt.autocode.gg/'\nauth = 'tok_prod_DxcW8FCKenfdpGDbGD8puUfjqmEYCpPTZ5DijpGLd1XHpzaep19jxyds6y6HLMQ1'\nheaders = {\n  'user-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 6.0; Nexus 5 Build/MRA58N) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/103.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36',\n  'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + auth,\n  'sender': 'wallet address'\n}\n\nres = requests.post(url,headers)\nprint(res.text)\n```\n\n填入我们扒出来的url、auth还有我们自己的钱包地址。运行结果如下：\n\n```\n{\"signature\":\"0xf5d836dbeb2662e5066256456d8a2d05d6de926d28e4e70861cd90dbd755345710d83b290bce4dfd530042d2c32f8fc2d287a535fcf89187b008baf8e386e816\",\"expireTime\":1658179246}\n```\n\n看看这是啥，这就是我们需要得到的签名了。我们绕过了前端，直接通过接口的方式提前获取到了签名，拿着这个签名就可以去mint啦。这个方法需要我们能够从js文件中找到接口的地址，还需要弄清楚接口需要发送那些参数，比较考验我们的经验还有阅读代码的能力。不同的项目的代码都是不一样的，所以基本上每个项目都得重新修改获取签名的方式。对于普通玩家就非常不友好了。这里也非常佩服市面上的一些工具，能够自动获取签名，让用户赢在起跑线。不得不说，收费有收费的道理啊！", "timestamp": 1658182353, "digest": "gPVRK6cMCQJwJCLu0JPE6TpqmwSfXUoFiWrCLN_FSH8", "contributor": "0xA8D33Fa0687d50606b44A4744ad5E8Ff314a20e9"}

Check out our [Easy LP feature](https://support.perp.com/hc/en-us/articles/5257563598617) to make it a breeze!*\n\nDidn’t receive invites to any pool parties this summer? No worries, as we have kicked off our very own!\n\nAs a new initiative for liquidity providers (LPs), Pool Party offers incentives in both OP and PERP tokens for facilitating volume on our DEX.\n\nIn case you missed it, we detailed the plans for our allocation of Optimism’s governance token OP last month in a tweet thread:\n\n[https://twitter.com/perpprotocol/status/1532821939936436224](https://twitter.com/perpprotocol/status/1532821939936436224)\n\nTo improve market depth and incentivize liquidity provision, we’re distributing 8 million OP tokens to LPs. Read our full proposal [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-perpetual-protocol/201).\n\nAnd as part of this distribution, we’re getting the pool party started with a big cheers to every single LP that has ever supplied liquidity by rewarding them with a retroactive airdrop!\n\n## Retroactive OP Airdrop🪂\n\nIf you’ve ever provided liquidity to any of the markets on [Perp v2](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post), then you’re in for a surprise!\n\n*Check [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUIh1Ba-oGX2lqnjab0FnJcuE8pY7qafPrHg3IcvlM8/edit?usp=sharing) to see if you’re eligible.*\n\nOut of the 8 million OP tokens allocated to our LPs, 1.8 million will be airdropped across all 689 historical LPs who have facilitated volume on our DEX since the launch of Perp v2 Curie. A total of 100,000 OP is to be allocated to each market.\n\nThe snapshot period covers the launch of Curie in November 2021, all the way until June 1, 2022. So if you’ve made markets before June 1, 2022, then you’re eligible to receive OP tokens!\n\nThe airdropped amount you’ll receive depends on how much volume your liquidity has facilitated for a market compared to the total. For example, if you facilitated 10% of the total volume for the ETH market between the launch of Curie until June 1, 2022, then you’ll receive 10,000 OP as an airdrop.\n\nIf you’re eligible, you’ll receive your **OP tokens directly to your Ethereum address on Monday, July 18th**!\n\n## Pool Party💧🥳\n\n5\\.2 million of the OP tokens dedicated to LPs will be distributed as incentives through our Pool Party initiative.\n\nMakers on Perp v2 currently receive 80% of the trading fees and weekly rewards of 5,000 PERP for each market. LPs can already enjoy hefty returns on Perp v2, with some markets offering triple-digit or even quadruple-digit APRs.\n\nBut since it’s OP summer, you can make hay while the sun shines with boosted rewards in the form of OP tokens!\n\nIf you want to accumulate some OP, all you have to do is:\n\n* **Pick a pool**,\n* **Provide liquidity**,\n* **Claim your OP tokens when the weekly rewards are distributed** (every Monday)!\n\n**LPs will need to** **claim their weekly OP rewards through the UI** when they are distributed on each Monday via the [Optimism](https://optimism.io/) network!\n\nThe number of OP tokens that makers can earn is based on how much volume you facilitate as compared to the size of the pool. For example, if you’ve supplied $100,000 worth of assets to a pool of size $1 million, then you’ll be able to claim 10% of the OP tokens allocated to that market from the weekly rewards.\n\nCheck out the following resources we’ve put together to help you get started as a maker and earn sweet yields:\n\n* [How to Provide Liquidity with Leverage on Perp v2](https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/85D6mYVpL2FkFpbJQx58dtVszO09citA4KOzFUFTSwY)\n* [What is Impermanent Loss?](https://blog.perp.fi/what-is-impermanent-loss-a9b1359d56f3?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------)\n* [How to Mitigate Impermanent Loss as a Maker on Perp v2](https://blog.perp.fi/how-to-mitigate-impermanent-loss-as-a-maker-on-perp-v2-dce3be4c3514)\n* [Earning Yield as a Maker with Easy LP](https://blog.perp.fi/earning-yield-as-a-maker-with-easy-lp-b72fa9f07730)\n* [Running Perp-maker for Fun & Profit (Part 1)](https://blog.perp.fi/running-perp-maker-for-profits-and-fun-part-1-a825ca1c9160?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------)\n* [Running Perp-maker for Fun & Profit (Part 2)](https://blog.perp.fi/running-perp-maker-for-profits-and-fun-part-2-673ef56da8da?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------)\n\nAnd on this note, we conclude our open invite to the Perpetual Protocol Pool Party.

USD\n\n研究种类：DAO, Governance, Tools\n\n原文作者:  Kenechukwu Eze\n\n创作者：Tian zhi xuan @DAOrayaki.org\n\n审核者：DAOctor@DAOrayaki.org\n\n原文: Decentralising leadership: from monolithic to modular and polycentric\n\n## 为什么要谈论领导力？\n\n如果你曾经担任过行政职务，成为有影响力的DAO成员，或者创立了一个新的组织，你可能会从内心深处体会到责任的重负。可能有非常多的工作，许多的不确定性，但却迫切需要做出重大、复杂，且往往会产生长期影响的决定。这是令人振奋的，但也是令人疲惫的，甚至是会使人变得神经质的。相反，处于无权无势的地位，即使不令人烦躁，也很快令人沮丧。而这当中的区别往往就被吹捧为：领导力。\n\n我们被告知，领导者会抱有一种心态和一套技能，如果我们掌握了这些，我们就能把事情做对。无数的研究人员沿着这条道路，汇编了各种理论和模型。与此同时，\"领导者 \"所面临的压力也在不断增加，要求他们掌握并表现出这些特质，也就是领导者应该是有远见的人、战略家、激励者、仆人、教练。。。这样的例子不胜枚举。\n\n有了所有关于领导力的工作，以及所有的这些期望，我们为什么要在这里谈论领导力呢？\n\n首先，通过Web3，我们可以从头开始思考这个话题和其他许多话题，从过去的经验中学习，但主要还是要建立在第一原则上，而不是陈旧的思维。其次，因为我担心我们在这里错过了一个诀窍，继续沿着这条道路走下去是有害的和不可持续的。\n\n下面的内容是试图为一场旧的辩论带来新的视角，也是受到 许多在这一领域已完成优秀项目并继续打拼的人 所启发的一个批判。\n\n## TL;DR\n\n下面，我将介绍另一个领导力模型，但这个想法并不是所谓的要 \"创造一个新的标准来取代以前所有的标准\"。相反，下面的模型说明了一个我认为更实用、更具破坏性的基本原则：我们可以从单一的领导力概念转向模块化的、多中心的领导力。\n\n从本质上讲，这里提出的模型摆脱了对领导力的单一概念，这种概念曾试图：\n\n* 对所有的领导行为、特质、角色等进行限定和量化，使之成为一个冗长的领导属性清单。\n* 并建议（通常是隐含的假设，但偶尔也会明确提出），我们需要 \"全能型 \"的领导者。\n\n相反的，这新的多中心、模块化的领导力模型表明：\n\n* 领导力有不同的领域和原型。\n* 每个人都可以掌握其中的一个或几个领域（但不可能在所有领域都很出色）。\n* 一个健康的组织依赖于合作，而合作的结果是在每个领域和原型中都有一定的能力。\n\n重要的是，模块化、多中心的领导力与 \"共享的、分布式的、集体的领导力\"\\[1\\]有不同之处，它基于三个原则：\n\n* 在谁担任领导的问题上有一定流动性是有利的，但完全依赖流动性很可能会导致 \"事情落败\"。\n* 我们可以把许多在 \"领导 \"下积累的基本职能，带回常规工作领域，从而减轻领导的负担。\n* 而且，领导和过程/角色几乎可以互换使用：同样的组织功能可以通过（是主要但并不完全是）：在需要时才出现的 \"领导 \"或通过先发制人的团体过程或角色来实现。\n\n好奇吗？那让我们再深入了解一下。\n\n## 我们如何达成？\n\n值得注意的是，大多数的领导力研究都是在大多数人被剥夺权力的环境下进行的：自上而下、命令与管控的组织，而其中大多数成员几乎没有所有权，只能在其特定角色的有限领域内提出变革。\n\n在这些环境中，员工跳出自己的角色，不顾一切地提出变革建议，动员他人，并且不承担负面的后果，这会是个例外而不是常规的。在传统的组织中，人们更期望老板能起到领导作用。\n\n有些老板是伟大的，有些则不那么伟大，在组织成功的地方，研究人员也跟着成功。\n\n首先，研究人员、顾问和从业人员都把注意力集中在领导者身上（组织中最明显的一部分），哈佛大学教授J.R哈克曼花了30多年时间研究团队，他称之为 \"领导归因错误\" ，也就是一种成功或失败被不成比例地归因于老板的现象。\n\n在某种程度上，研究人员还将组织与社会运动进行了比较。在社会运动中，有影响力的人物都从卑微的开始出现。而他们的结论是我们需要开始寻找两件事：\n\n* 非老板但有影响力的人物自身的品质使他们与其他人不同。\n* 使这些人物得以出现的是环境因素。\n\n大多数的领导力理论可以追溯到上述三种方法中的其中一种（研究指挥与管控组织中的老板，社会运动中知名人物的素质，以及使他们能够出现的环境因素）。\n\n随着研究的深入，关于如何成为一个好的老板，什么能使一个人成为有影响力的人物，以及如何为有影响力的人物的出现创造条件的研究结果不断积累。\n\n同时，随着创新成为组织成功的决定性因素，以及 \"人才争夺战 \"的加剧，组织成功的标准也随之提高，因此，对老板和经理的期望也随之提高。\n\n早期的期望包括提供方向，做出改变，并召集其他人参与到这个事业中来（注意与军事领导人或其他指挥与管控领导人的相似之处）。最近，团队的福祉被添加进来，刺激他们的思维并挑战他们超越自我，从各地带来信息和资源，明确责任，关注结果，承担风险，促进学习，创造心理安全，给予和接受反馈，这个清单还在继续。我们面临着领导力膨胀。\n\n隐藏在这些模式和期望中的观念是，这些任务、活动和结果不是常规工作。相反，它们是额外的一部分，是许多人试图描述和培养的一种几乎无形的、浪漫化的品质。\n\n同时，与自上而下、命令与管控的组织环境相比，我们看到了另类运动的发展：合作社、自我管理的组织、网络化的组织和DAO。\n\n这些组织的运作模式与传统的命令与管控相反。他们不依靠领导者来运作，而是旨在利用集体的力量：集体所有、集体责任和集体治理。\n\n虽然其他的这些环境已经存在了一段时间，但与传统组织相比，它们的数量相形见绌，而在学术界，主流研究的影响占主导地位。但也许，我们可能正在迈向一个转折点。也许我们在 \"领导力 \"下积累的所有品质已经多到一个人都无法掌握，而世界的步伐也快到任何一个老板或领导者都无法保持领先。我们的组织和领导范式已无法跟上脚步。\n\n它其实也不需要这样做。当一个结构变得单一，并在其自身的重负下崩溃时，那就是时候审查其目的，重构和模块化了。\n\n也许我们已经开始把太多的东西放在一个概念里，使基本功能成为例外，而不是规范。因此，让我们回到基本的问题上；我们实际上需要实现的是什么？我们能不能从选择组织的代理人的角度来构思这个问题，和哪个模式拥有 比命令与管控模式 来得更多的方式进行合作和分工？\n\n## 可行性的基本功能\n\n从基础的开始，我们可以说组织的存在是为了满足其利益相关者的需求。毕竟如果我们能够单独地满足自己的需求，我们就不会费尽心思来组织。而如果不能满足其他利益相关者的需求（或者不能成为他们的最佳选择），他们就会脱离，并去别的地方了。\n\n因此，当我们需要组织起来，这可能意味着一系列的事情；在这里，也有很多模式存在。我不会试图选择 \"一个单一的模型来解释这一切\"，但我会做一个有根据的猜测，选择一个被证明有用的模型。然后，我们将继续我们的练习，以表明这一调查路线可以通过这个新的模型引导我们对领导力有一个极其不同的概念。我希望，是一个更有用的模式。\n\n对于这个模型，我主要借鉴了比尔的可行系统模型的概念，它描述了使一个系统可行的5个基本功能（即一个能够适应不断变化甚至是敌对环境并蓬勃发展的系统）。我还加入了彼得-弗罗斯特和桑德拉-罗宾逊对 \"毒性处理者 \"的研究元素，以及对多种领导力理论的引用。最终，模型里各种泡沫可以被改变和重新洗牌。最重要的是多重的、不同的但相互依存的、平行的功能原则，因为这些功能对于一个团队保持执行力是至关重要的。\n\n六个为了可行性而做的关键互动（SKI）：\n\n以下是发生在人与人之间的六种基本功能，因此称为互动。这都是以它们所要解决的问题作为代表。\n\n* 身份：是什么让我们走到一起？我们的存在是为了服务谁，他们的需求是什么？\n* 未来：鉴于我们的环境演变，我们将如何发展以满足这些需求？\n* 变化：我们如何从这里走向我们想要达到的那个未来？我们如何改变和发展，并在各部分之间创造协同作用？\n* 协调：我们如何协调我们的工作？\n* 运营：我们每天都在做什么来为我们的利益相关者提供价值？\n* 支持\\*：我们如何使每个人都能持续地付出他们的努力？\n\n\\*熟悉VSM的朋友会注意到，支持可能属于比尔公司所谓的系统2。在SKI模型中，尽管（或特别是在）在一个有利于工人参与多个组织的环境中，\"支持 \"也会被赋予了自己的空间来推行自己（因为它在整个组织中被系统地忽略了），同时也强调了关心在嵌套系统的重要性。最终，这是一个针对特定环境的设计选择，所以请根据需要来自由调整。\n\n## 多中心、模块化领导\n\n当我们审视这些组织功能时，并远离工业时代组织的等级观念，我们可以设想一个有效并具有平行的功能的组织：每个功能对其生存至关重要，每个功能履行不同的作用。赋予这些功能活力，我们就拥有了一群人。而且是复数的。\n\n如果一个人必须监督所有的基本功能，他们很可能在压力下崩溃，又或者，正如最经常发生的那样，忘了一个或几个，直到有事情发生。许多组织都是这样走过来的，从危机到危机。依靠几个人表现出英雄般的领导力，并把全世界扛在肩上。其他组织试图走相反的极端方法，分散管理和责任，试图让每个人都能领导一切（许多DAO都在走这条路），但往往会遇到许多空档，许多人发现任务太过艰巨而不选择站出来，或者最糟糕的是，由于无结构的暴政，一个寡头统治了全部人。那么，如果我们以不同的方式切开属于我们的馅饼呢？\n\n在不同的时间和文化中，一个基本原则不断显现出来：不同的组织功能需要不同的个性来激活它们。例如，在祖先的部落中，我们发现萨满/长老和战士酋长。两者都拥有权力，都显示出领导力，但都是不同的类型。\n\n在中世纪的欧洲，我们区分了教皇和皇帝，主教和国王。最近，我们通过权力划分巩固了现代民主制度，而在Web2创业文化中，梦想团队的备忘录是由 \"一个黑客、一个潮人和一个骗子 \"组成的三人组。然而，在领导力的研究中，我们似乎已经失去了这种多中心主义，而倾向于一个单一的概念。\n\n因此，让我们来探讨一些替代方案。\n\n借用我们上面的SKI框架，6个功能中的每一个都有自己的气场，有自己的个性。对于一个强调组织基本功能的框架来说，这些功能也与领导力理论中的流行特征互相重叠了，但这并不奇怪（例如，促成变革、支持他人、创造意义等）。我们把它作为一种启发式的方法（\"所有的模型都是错的，有些是有用的\"），得出了以下的模型。6种领导原型\n\n* 哲学家/长者/源头 -> 身份\n* 有远见的人/鼓舞人心的领导者 -> 远见\n* 战略家/变革代理人 -> 变革\n* 协调员/统筹者 -> 协调\n* 工匠/技艺师 -> 运营\n* 照顾者/教练 -> 支持\n\n## 多中心、模块化领导的结果\n\n正如你在阅读清单时可能注意到的那样，某些人比其他人更有活力，更受某些原型的吸引，也更能体现某些原型。\n\n尽管我们所体现的原型是天性和教养的结果，但只要下足了努力，我们肯定能在每一种原型上有所提高。然而，如果我们试图在所有方面都发挥领导作用，我们就有可能使我们的注意力过于分散。\n\n同样，也存在一些两极分化。我们很难同时成为一个好的战略家和照顾者。或者一个哲学家和一个手工艺人。而从陈规定型来看，有远见的人是不善于协调的人。那些能够弥合这些两极分化的人确实存在，所以要注意不要把定型观念看得过于有用。\n\n好消息是，合作可以帮助我们专注于我们的优势而不是我们的弱点，在晚上睡得更好，更好地服务于他人。\n\n坏消息是，那些精通某一特定原型的人往往更重视它，也更可能重视体现同一原型的人。同样，社区和组织也倾向于围绕类似的原型形成。其结果是，某些原型在每个社区和组织中往往被系统地低估，而且往往是不自觉地低估。\n\n重要的是，我们需要注意到，原型往往违背了专业的分类，而且是视情况而定的。我见过的财务领导主要是护理人员。还有一些人力资源部门的领导，他们的主要原型是战略家，而最不突出的原型是照顾者。我也曾遇到过这样的情况：考虑到我的同事们的长处和短处，我更倾向于弥补和体现更多的原型，而不是我的默认合集。这种经历让我相当痛苦，最终导致我决定离开我共同创立的公司，并取消了我的股份。事后看来...\n\n教训是，在某些情况下，我们不太可能是适合这份工作的人。但是，我们不要看轻自己（或他人），而是可以尝试重新定位，寻找更方便的情况，或找到互补的人来支持我们。这就是从单一领导模式转向多元领导的模式，也就是多中心模式。\n\n\n---\n\n

At CryptoAnime, we believe that NFTs should derive their value from the story they tell. Our NFTs play an essential role in an ongoing narrative, providing creative *utility,* meaning and purpose designed to push the story forward while unlocking new sources of income for the collaborating artists.  Our motto is best described as *\"the story is the business model.\"*\n\n... and the storyline behind the NFTs is just as unorthodox as the business approach. **Hekonai** is a \"meta-narrative.” Its outer layer is designed to include everything you need in quality storytelling: distinctive characters, interesting events, relatable themes, a gamut of emotions, exotic settings, dramatic tension, plenty of excitement.\n\nBut that's not all it offers: on a second, deeper level, the unfolding plotline reflects the development of CryptoAnime itself in allegorical form. The idea is to offer entertainment that also weaves in commentary about NFTs, cryptofinance, Web3 and all the other brave new frontiers our company will explore.\n\nHekonai enters this storyline as a forgotten comic figure from the first anime. He becomes self-aware and takes control of his destiny as he travels into the metaverse to achieve his long-held dream of becoming a legendary samurai. His process of transformation drives a narrative that establishes meaning, purpose and utility for the NFTs that will explore the complexities of his new life as someone who can travel through several universes: animated, technological, even human life.\n\nThe story and digital assets will be complementary and interconnected in this meta-narrative format, each giving rise to the other as they interact with each other across multiple storylines and universes... including some generated by NFT holders. Sort of like the yin-yang symbol, with each side supporting and feeding into the other until they become indivisible.\n\n![Relationship between Story and Digital Assets](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/61JVPuoIQvANVPDffthUz.png?height=838&width=685)\n\nWe've got lots of surprises coming your way on both story and tech fronts. But first, we need to introduce you to Hekonai. He's written a journal for you that will draw you into his brave new world.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Hekonai's Journal - Season I** will present over 20 short story entries in the form of 200-word posts, often accompanied by original illustrations commissioned and created by anime/manga-inspired artists from every corner of our world, and links to other online media curated to enhance your aesthetic experience.\n\nYou'll be there at every step as he tells you the tale of his rebirth in his own words.

Uma das coisas mais importantes sobre esta nova tecnologia é que ela é descentralizada.\n\nUma Blockchain é mantida por uma rede de participantes (nós da rede) que chegam a um acordo sobre o status da rede (e transações realizadas) a partir de um mecanismo de consenso. Esse mecanismo diz respeito a como as redes estão seguras contra ataques e como os participantes chegaram a um acordo sobre um status para a rede.\n\nOs tipos mais comuns são a prova de trabalho (PoW, do inglês proof-of-work), usado pela rede Bitcoin e atualmente pela Ethereum (julho de 2022), e a prova de participação (PoS, do inglês proof-of-stake), usada, em geral, por plataformas de contratos inteligentes. Os tokens nestas redes são distribuídos aos participantes para que cumpram seu papel em assegurar a rede pelo mecanismo de consenso.\n\n![Fonte: https://cmte.ieee.org/futuredirections/2022/03/09/proof-of-stake-a-game-changer/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/em3zrricUcV52ZejXUzvT.jpg?height=1000&width=2000)\n\nEm tradução livre da imagem:\n\n**PoS (prova de participação)**, proprietários dos tokens da rede devem guardar uma quantidade mínima para se tornarem validadores. O contrato inteligente da Blockchain seleciona quem irá validar a transação, incluir um novo bloco na rede e receber a recompensa.\n\n**PoW (prova de trabalho)**, neste sistema apenas o primeiro validor que conseguir resolver a transação poderá incluir o novo bloco na rede e receber a recompensa por ele.\n\nEm relação ao custo de energia, enquanto PoW exige a utilização de hardwares especializados, com alta capacidade de processamento e gasto de energia, ainda há o fato da concorrência entre os validadores (mineradores), pois a cada transação apenas o primeiro a conseguir resolver é recompensado. Todos os demais que participaram gastaram tempo e processamento sem necessidade.\n\nJá no mecanismo PoS não há utilização de equipamentos e o consenso é administrado pelo contrato intelidente através dos validadores, que são os usuários que possuem uma determinada quantidade do token travado na rede.\n\nPor exemplo, no momento que publico esse artigo (julho de 2022) a rede Ethereum está em processo de migrar do mecanismo PoW para Pos. Para ser tornar um validador (nó da rede) do Etherium é preciso ter guardado na rede a quantidade mínima de 32 ETH, cerca de U$ 40 mil dólares (cotação de julho de 2022).\n\nDeixando a especulação financeira de lado, a tecnologia Blockchain é base das criptomoedas e da Web3, sendo um novo tipo de estrutura de dados de back-end.\n\nEssa nova arquitetura de dados teve origem em meados de 2009 (após a [crise finaceira do mercado imobiliário](https://www.politize.com.br/crise-financeira-de-2008/) americado de 2008), o que alegam ser uma das motivações de [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) – identidade utilizada pela pessoa (ou pessoas) que criaram o Bitcoin e a primeira Blockchain, com o objetivo de realizar transferências monetárias entre pessoas, sem intermediação de governos ou bancos, ou seja, um meio de pagamento digital e descentralizado.\n\nAtualmente há centenas de criptoativos (muitos com sua própria blockchain), contudo o Bitcoin ainda é o principal deste mercado e o único a manter sua finalidade de moeda digital (mesmo não sendo concretizada ainda).\n\nApesar de polêmico, o Bitcoin, a cada ano que passa, aumenta sua adesão por empresas, governos e até instituições financeiras, especialmente, como reserva de valor, amenizando a perda da inflação das moedas governamentais (como o nosso real), o que “rendeu” o apelido de ouro digital ao Bitcoin.\n\nDiferente do Bitcoin, algumas Blockchains são plataformas de contratos inteligentes. A pioneira nesse segmento e líder na quantidade de projetos desenvolvidos é a Ethereum.\n\nEnquanto o Bitcoin é comparado ao ouro, o Ethereum pode ser comparado ao ferro, pois é matéria-prima para a construção de algo novo. Há centenas de projetos desenvolvidos sobre a plataforma de contratato inteligente da Ethereum.\n\nEssas plataformas também são chamadas de \"redes de primeira camada\" e, além da Ethereum, outros projetos estão incluídos como Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Luna, Tezos e mais. Os aplicativos criados nessas redes são conhecidos como aplicativos descentralizados (dApps).\n\n**Outros dois movimentos aumentaram o interesse do mercado pelas criptomoedas: finanças descentralizadas (DeFi) e os tokens não fungíveis (NFTs).**\n\nAs DeFi são um conjunto de aplicativos que oferecem aos usuários um serviço de finanças descentralizadas, como empréstimo, crédito, derivados e outros a partir de criptomoedas baseadas em blockchain.\n\nConfira neste artigo mais detalhes sobre que são os NFTs.", "timestamp": 1658187475, "digest": "tGmC_8jpC6LihwoTn8EaoMi1mSWqowe-KpoeQ-IefMs", "contributor": "0x8A86d40E449Fecf1C0daF52CF73193D0eB05f703"}
{"id": "jWJpbXgUVWxdSdRY5zk2fZizzuAXc6ckUsIp1V-UDLw", "title": "平行链上线技术系列三 -Rococo local and public test network", "body": "## 引言\n\n本文首先介绍在Rococo本地的测试流程，最后介绍rococo 线上测试parachain的流程\n\n## Rococo local test network中测试parachain\n\n### Start Relaychain(Local Rococo relaychain)\n\n准备 rococo-local-cfde.json\n\n以下命令是在 polkadot 目录下操作的，这里切换分支到 v0.9.16,然后编译 cargo build --release\n\n编译完成后，在polkadot目录下执行：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C_0xRnm5IGE_P4MsMgOvu.png?height=181&width=837)\n\n### 启动parachain\n\n### 生成parachain的 chain spec\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2-Dju-evUp90RJWmuy56u.png?height=82&width=834)\n\n如果需要修改paraId,可以修改rococo-local-parachain-plain.json文件\n\n这里修改为: 2052\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-thk3hu4K0PrQ95D_1GKN.png?height=210&width=836)\n\n### 生成修改后的paraId的chainspec文件\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tkaCKwJhdN7E9MNZTyGoI.png?height=83&width=840)\n\n### 生成wasm文件\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CenBN-jai3EVSTOaDZJKf.png?height=81&width=834)\n\n### 生成genesis state文件\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vriEyaryQVmDJmORhbAXG.png?height=83&width=836)\n\n### 启动本地collator节点\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O_Godd8q2ej5lraF6UoKm.png?height=359&width=834)\n\n然后在打开本地的relaychain的polkadot-js的前端界面，注册parachain，上传Wasm和genesis state 参考：https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/cumulus/connect-parachain/\n\nRococo live test network中测试parachain\n比如，上面我们已经注册了parachain 2052,那么我们就可以在rococo公开测试网上测试我们的Parachain了。\n\n步骤:\n\n1、在 rococo public test network 注册一个paraId\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jfHWVEeK2sqCNdRIgt5pD.png?height=380&width=1080)\n\n2、通过这个ParaId（这里选择自己已经注册的一个Id，我这里选自己注册的2052）以及之前我们本地生成的genesis state和wasm文件来注册parathread\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9fMMrVTjnmngWmYE3pdJU.png?height=511&width=1080)\n\n3、当注册成为一个parathread后，我们可以看到parathread处于onboarding状态。此时，我们就可以申请成为平行链了，可以联系Parity官方的人进行操作，在element频道\n\n4、如果官方的人将Parathread升级为parachain后，我们就可以开始本地启动平行链进行测试，是否能链接到rococo live且正常出块。\n\n（1）首先，启动Live模式的parachain，这里有两种方式：\n\n第一种：修改parachain链的chainspec文件，以命令行的方式进行指定Live启动\n\n第二种：通过json文件的形式，由于我们之前已经在本地生成了rococo-local-parachain-2052-raw.json 这个文件，我们只需要修改其中的一些参数（目前很多项目方使用较为普遍的方式，而且操作简单）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FpJHjby12E72RERG8Eq9N.png?height=619&width=768)\n\n主要修改字段为：\n\nchainType：需要将Local修改为Live,\nrelay_chain：修改为rococo\npara_id：需要与我们在rococo live上注册的parachainId保持一致\n其他的字段看自己需要进行修改，也可不修改\n\n这里值得一提的就是bootNodes字段，这个字段在自己首次本地启动的时候无需进行配置，但是如果你的平行链已经上线并且需要给其他用户加入的话，这里就需要进行配置引导节点。\n\n（2）获取当前需要连接的rococo live的chain spec文件\n\n笔者此时的rococo live的runtime版本为polkadot-v0.9.16，所以我们从polkadot上获取到rococo的chain spec文件 ，放在我们的parachain目录下\n\n注意，我们的parachain live的runtime版本必须要和当前rococo live的版本一致\n\n（3）一切准备就绪后（准备好parachain live的chain spec文件和rococo live 的chain spec文件），我们就可以启动我们本地的平行链，准备连接到rococo live进行parachain出块测试了\n\n注意，下面的base path我们需要预留至少12G的空间(以当前时间为2022-02-20来计算的话)，否则空间不够拉取rococo的区块\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Fzb_bblMSkHgH9D7Trcog.png?height=379&width=832)\n\n在启动上述命令后，我们可以看到Log里会同步rococo的区块，整个过程大概耗时2小时左右，等待全部同步完毕后，我们的Parachain就会正常出块了～。\n\n查看rococo test network可以看到：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3rXCafMvytYfmqk2SBXwW.png?height=492&width=1000)\n\n打开本地8844端口可以看到parachain已经可以正常出块了，这里我已经出到204个块.....\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/erOdFD0dUJZ7GpzwFkE2Z.png?height=471&width=1000)\n\n至此，rococo live测试结束～\n\nRococo live 部署注意事项：\n\n1、如果出现以下问题:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/68yMT9DVa0n_doRpnraYb.png?height=80&width=832)\n\n这种是由于使用的rococo live的json文件和当前rococo live版本不一致导致的，比如使用的是polkadot-0.9.13的live文件，然而当前rococo live版本为polkadot-v0.9.16\n\n2、同步中继链区块错误：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2jUp9lxSYYeCD1CgPb5PR.png?height=330&width=836)\n\n这里是由于我们live Parachain的版本和rococ live不一致\n\n3、在将pallet版本从polkadot-v0.9.13升级到polkadot-v0.9.16时，出现一些pallet宏功能无法使用问题\n\n（1）pallet Struct的宏问题\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C5BXrt0I6p35uWuZc3Q3H.png?height=180&width=720)\n\n当前polkadot-v0.9.16版本中，Pallet结构体上需要加上#\\[pallet::without_storage_info\\]\n\n（2）pallet storage问题\n\n当前polkadot-v0.9.16版本中，我们在使用StorageMap这个存储结构的时候，如果我们的存储结构中涉及到AccountId需要使用OptionQuery的方式，而非之前的ValueQuery，因为在官方移除了对于AccountId的default处理，所以我们就需要使用Option的方式处理空值None。对应的咱们的pallet就需要进行重构，并对None进行处理，杜绝Runtime出现这种异常。\n\n4、在同步rococo live的区块时，出现以下错误，并且可以看到一直拉取不到最新的区块（本地同步的区块始终低于最新区块高度）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CzgzyOEyt9CeCV4lsIYD6.png?height=153&width=835)\n\n这里是由于本地机器时间不同步，使用ntp同步即可\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y22_HmUImQ_W8mrXUgEpg.png?height=53&width=833)\n\n\n---\n\n通过

O contrato inteligente da Blockchain seleciona quem irá validar a transação, incluir um novo bloco na rede e receber a recompensa.\n\n**PoW (prova de trabalho)**, neste sistema apenas o primeiro validor que conseguir resolver a transação poderá incluir o novo bloco na rede e receber a recompensa por ele.\n\nEm relação ao custo de energia, enquanto PoW exige a utilização de hardwares especializados, com alta capacidade de processamento e gasto de energia, ainda há o fato da concorrência entre os validadores (mineradores), pois a cada transação apenas o primeiro a conseguir resolver é recompensado. Todos os demais que participaram gastaram tempo e processamento sem necessidade.\n\nJá no mecanismo PoS não há utilização de equipamentos e o consenso é administrado pelo contrato intelidente através dos validadores, que são os usuários que possuem uma determinada quantidade do token travado na rede.\n\nPor exemplo, no momento que publico esse artigo (julho de 2022) a rede Ethereum está em processo de migrar do mecanismo PoW para Pos. Para ser tornar um validador (nó da rede) do Etherium é preciso ter guardado na rede a quantidade mínima de 32 ETH, cerca de U$ 40 mil dólares (cotação de julho de 2022).\n\nDeixando a especulação financeira de lado, a tecnologia Blockchain é base das criptomoedas e da Web3, sendo um novo tipo de estrutura de dados de back-end.\n\nEssa nova arquitetura de dados teve origem em meados de 2009 (após a [crise finaceira do mercado imobiliário](https://www.politize.com.br/crise-financeira-de-2008/) americado de 2008), o que alegam ser uma das motivações de [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) – identidade utilizada pela pessoa (ou pessoas) que criaram o Bitcoin e a primeira Blockchain, com o objetivo de realizar transferências monetárias entre pessoas, sem intermediação de governos ou bancos, ou seja, um meio de pagamento digital e descentralizado.\n\nAtualmente há centenas de criptoativos (muitos com sua própria blockchain), contudo o Bitcoin ainda é o principal deste mercado e o único a manter sua finalidade de moeda digital (mesmo não sendo concretizada ainda).\n\nApesar de polêmico, o Bitcoin, a cada ano que passa, aumenta sua adesão por empresas, governos e até instituições financeiras, especialmente, como reserva de valor, amenizando a perda da inflação das moedas governamentais (como o nosso real), o que “rendeu” o apelido de ouro digital ao Bitcoin.\n\nDiferente do Bitcoin, algumas Blockchains são plataformas de contratos inteligentes. A pioneira nesse segmento e líder na quantidade de projetos desenvolvidos é a Ethereum.\n\nEnquanto o Bitcoin é comparado ao ouro, o Ethereum pode ser comparado ao ferro, pois é matéria-prima para a construção de algo novo. Há centenas de projetos desenvolvidos sobre a plataforma de contratato inteligente da Ethereum.\n\nEssas plataformas também são chamadas de \"redes de primeira camada\" e, além da Ethereum, outros projetos estão incluídos como Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Luna, Tezos e mais. Os aplicativos criados nessas redes são conhecidos como aplicativos descentralizados (dApps).\n\n**Outros dois movimentos aumentaram o interesse do mercado pelas criptomoedas: finanças descentralizadas (DeFi) e os tokens não fungíveis (NFTs).**\n\nAs DeFi são um conjunto de aplicativos que oferecem aos usuários um serviço de finanças descentralizadas, como empréstimo, crédito, derivados e outros a partir de criptomoedas baseadas em blockchain.\n\nConfira neste artigo mais detalhes sobre que são os NFTs.", "timestamp": 1658187488, "digest": "vui0LzOpC3Kst21sNatq5X4dXUKqn-pHl8oZzEaSfkM", "contributor": "0x8A86d40E449Fecf1C0daF52CF73193D0eB05f703"}

交易体 -（六）\n\n在Substrate中的交易不再称为Transaction，而是称为了Extrinsic，中文翻译就是“外部的；外表的；外源性”，意味着被称为Extrinsic的概念，对于区块链而言是外部的输入。这种定义脱离了本身“交易”的范畴（更像是转账的概念），而是在链的状态的角度下，认为交易及类似概念是一种改变状态的外部输入（意味着不止转账，只要是外部的操作都是，pallet func）。\n\n一个“外部输入”至少会具备以下两个条件：\n\n* 发送者的证明\n* 外部输入的行为\n\n其中第一点是显然的，只要基于公私钥体系，就一定需要发送者对这个发送的内容进行签名，在链上通过这个签名验证合法性，解析出发送者的公钥识别身份。等价于互联网中客户端持有的token这类的。而第二点就是这个“输入”是到链上干嘛的，其相当于是用户发送到链上的**指令行为**。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ttXXyTMN5D9PqUMHRVx72.png?height=394&width=840)\n\n关于链下如何构造这个signature，\n\n**插曲：链下一个交易体的构成：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-1lv6GhseuAYxFdPESwg6.png?height=120&width=841)\n\n**交易bytes内容的构造:**\n\npallet-func index + 发起人的Account（公钥）+ signature(signed, signature, extra) + call\n\npallet-func index是通过pallet name 和 function name在metadata里查询得到到index\n\n交易执行之后可以在此处\n\nexplorer下观察到signature的信息：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xikwq7JH0z1YOZ7Ufv7IS.png?height=295&width=1000)\n\ncall里的内容主要由call index和参数构造而成。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xFBlNceP9rQP-Yt5ASKjh.png?height=347&width=1080)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XlTz6CFShdfo-cUq1zxPk.png?height=447&width=844)\n\n至此我们获悉了交易体的byte信息\n\n所以对于上述的例子，相对应的字节费用为\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kNHJskfyzZUkH0wLcxIo7.png?height=80&width=840)\n\n其实在这里可以观察到由于交易体的设计，可以实现在发送之前就可以计算出交易的大小从而推导出交易的手续费。\n\n还有其他的玩法：\n\n* 交易版本与链上版本检查\n* 交易存活性检查\n* 特殊交易的额外信息检查\n* 例如如果一个交易是转账transfer，可以直接检查发送者的余额是否足够，不用到区块执行阶段才判定。\n\n### 权重费用(weight_fee)\n\n在有限的区块生成时间和链上状态的限制下，权重被用来定义交易产生的计算复杂度即所消耗的计算资源，以及占据的链上状态。system模块定义了区块的总权重（BlockWeights）。\n\n\\#\\[pallet::weight(200_000, xx, xx, xx)\\]\n\n为了保证在网络繁忙的情况下，依然能够实现对区块链应用有效合理的管理，Substrate引入了三种不同级别的交易类型，既 Normal、Operational 和 Mandatory 类型。\n\nNormal类型的交易是由网络中的普通用户提交，\n\nOperational类型的交易是由网络中的管理员或者管理委员会共同触发。\n\nMandatory类型的交易表示网络中区块交易所必须的交易信息，通常是内在的交易，由验证人触发。\n\n区块资源如长度和总权重按照一定比例在这三种类型的交易中进行分配，这一比例称为可用区块比（AvailableBlockRatio）。Kusama网络的设置为：\n\n10^12 weight = 1s\n\n1000weight = 1ns\n\n* 区块的总权重：2,000,000,000,000 weight(2秒)\n* 可用区块比：75%，即Normal交易最多只占用75%的区块资源，Operational类型的交易则可以占用100%的区块资源，新的交易如果导致对应资源使用率超过阈值后，会被拒绝。对于Mandatory类型的交易，即使在区块已经满了的情况下，依然可以把交易打包进区块内。\n\n**1、默认weight注释**\n\nSubstrate 中的所有可调度函数都必须指定权重。你可以使用注释的方式\n\n\\#\\[pallet::weight(xxx_xxx)\\] ，这个规范允许你组合包括 数据库读/写，权重的固定值 以及 基于banchmark的固定值。下面是一个基本的demo\n\nps: ExtrinsicBaseWeight 会自动添加到声明的权重中，以考虑将空的外部数据简单地包含到块中的成本。\n\n**对数据库访问进行参数化**\n\n为了使权重注释独立于部署的数据库后端，它们被定义为一个常量，然后在表示可调度执行的数据库访问时在‘注释’中使用：\n\n**2、自定义weight**\n\n可以创建自定义重量计算类型，而不是使用上述默认重量注释。此类型必须实现以下特征：\n\n* WeighData: 确定发货重量。\n* ClassifyDispatch：确定调度的类。\n* PaysFee：确定可调度的发件人是否支付费用。\n\n最后，weight fee的公式：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FJqMGt8hFNwG_o5lFkzYB.png?height=59&width=839)\n\n### 动态调节费率（targeted_fee_adjustment）\n\n设置  FeeMultiplierUpdate 参数即可\n\n细节深入—— Relay-chain transaction fees and per-block transaction limits\n\nToken Economics - Research at W3F\n\n区块链上的交易需求通常非常不规则。一方面，在一天内的小时或一个月内的天数范围内存在活动高峰。另一方面，有长期趋势的交易量增长趋势。我们需要一种机制，在考虑这些因素的情况下，随着时间的推移自动更新交易费用。\n\n根据供求规律，提高费用就可以减少需求，降低费用就可以促进需求。\n\n为了应对活动高峰，我们面临着在快速提高交易费用或可能有很长的交易包含时间之间进行权衡——两者都是不良影响。我们提出了两种机制。**第一种快速调节机制（Fast adjusting mechanism）**，可以非常迅速地调整价格，与活动的高峰和低谷同步。**第二种慢速调整机制（Slow adjusting mechanism）**，是以长期趋势的速度进行缓慢调整，并使用小费为用户提供在高峰时段控制等待时间的可能性。parity官方建议使用带有tips的慢速调整机制。\n\n关于动态调整机制的设置，也是在pallet_transaction_payment下进行配置。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z4xakw0WrpcypexK58xPe.png?height=296&width=836)\n\n### 小费（tip）\n\n小费不是必须的的，具体数量是由交易发送者决定的，并且完全由区块生产着获得；\n\n而交易费用的其他组成部分会根据一定的比例进行分配，国库80%，区块生产者20%。\n\n题外话：最后的手续费去哪里了\n\n至此关于交易手续费的内容，就全部介绍完毕，我们也进一步了理解了各个参数的含义，这个时候我们再回头看细化之后的公式，就能理解底层计算的计算逻辑了。\n\n关于手续费最终计算的代码：https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/polkadot-v0.9.18/frame/transaction-payment/src/lib.rs#L505-L537\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SuzABtDEHEB8_pOwvoSkj.png?height=237&width=845)\n\n## 关于 Benchmark\n\nSubstrate Benchmarking Documentation\n\nbenchmark主要是用于调整weight的内容，字节费用通过配置pallet_transaction_payment的runtime即可解决。\n\n在 Substrate 中，10^12 个weight单位 = 1 秒，或 1,000 个weight单位 = 1 纳秒。\n\n为什么需要使用benchmark\n\n拒绝服务 (DoS) 是分布式系统（包括区块链网络）的常见攻击媒介。这种攻击的一个简单示例是用户重复执行涉及密集计算的外部函数。为了防止用户向网络发送垃圾信息，我们向用户收取发送cal的费用。调用成本应反映系统产生的计算和存储成本，调用越复杂，费用越高。但是，我们仍然希望鼓励用户使用我们的区块链系统，所以我们也希望这个估算成本相对准确，这样我们就不会向用户收取不必要的费用。\n\n基准测试允许开发人员向最终用户收取适当的交易费用，以更准确地表示系统上的外部成本。设置合适的权重函数，准确反映底层计算和存储，也是 Substrate 中重要的安全保障。\n\n简单的理解：weight可以手动设置，但是每台机器的性能可能不一致，可以使用benchmark做一个测试然后测算出指定机器下 weight的大致范围。\n\n### 确定机器配置\n\n在进行benchmark之前，我们需要先确定机器的配置信息。\n\n### Benchmark的可用选项\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/US-4igPHvrjxFQihbswXr.png?height=831&width=562)\n\n### 进行Benchmark测试\n\n在pallet下创建benchmarking.rs文件\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lGsAuYoZRIe_QHvQ21YNJ.png?height=260&width=843)\n\n编写完benchmark之后 需要在生产机器下去进行benhmark测试。\n\n关于benchmark的一些配置项：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Mcycb1Kfo_DO3n1-ukXUS.png?height=302&width=839)\n\n你可以指定weight的模版生成定制之后的weight文件\n\n模版文件\n\n./.maintain/frame-weight-template.hbs内容：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mzbzNixaFYZ1E54Qfc3Vk.png?height=593&width=838)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J5rjX4JDp1ueUUwDp0Pje.png?height=840&width=506)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yoftcu7j-Sho8moMYqPah.png?height=367&width=506)\n\n根据模版文件生成指定的weight文件\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ts_i-dBHymoJEOukmva3i.png?height=277&width=842)\n\n测试完成之后，关于weights的值也就估算成功了，在pallet里引入weight即可\n\n## Other link\n\n*https://github.com/paritytech/subport/issues/149*\n\n*中如何计算工龄在Substrate中如何计算交易权重姒煜的博客-CSDN博客*\n\n*Gavin：关于 Weight 你必须了解的要点哔哩哔哩bilibili*\n\n*Token Economics -

Get each article as it comes out by subscribing below.\n\n[Subscribe now](%%checkout_url%%)\n\nI am an artist manager, and also run a small record label. The relationship I have with Spotify Playlists is one that I deem to be quite unhealthy, and yet it is something I spend a lot of my time on.\n\nWhenever one of our artists has a release coming out, I painstakingly pitch the track to Spotify’s backend *Spotify For Artists*, as well as doing up a more detailed pitch to my label’s distributor, who then (presumably) pitch to their direct contacts at the various DSPs (a DSP is a Digital Service Provider such as Spotify/Apple Music/Tidal etc).\n\nThe reason I and thousands of others do this is to get a shot at one of the most coveted prizes in modern music - *The Spotify Editorial Playlist*.\n\nWhat Are Spotify Editorial Playlists? They are official playlists curated by Spotify staff where thousands of people will hear new (or old) music for the first time.\n\nYou can always tell a Spotify Playlist as they are down as the owner of the playlist on the platform (think *Fresh Folk, Peaceful Piano, New Music Friday UK* etc).\n\nAs of today there are 1,520 official Spotify Playlists that serve every genre under the sun.\n\nLots of artists would be familiar with the *Spotify For Artists* backend, which is where they can make their pitch. It’s essentially a bite-sized sales pitch that you send into Spotify’s team in order to be considered for their Editorial Playlisting which typically updates every Friday. \n\nSometimes when you release music it gets picked up on these playlists and it can stay there for anything from a week to a few months. Fantastic! More people will listen to your music and hopefully resonate with it.\n\nSometimes however it doesn’t get chosen for these coveted playlists, and that can be devastating to an artist or a label. This is because in the current music release landscape, Spotify Editorial Playlisting is a central facet of nearly all ‘mainstream’ release strategies. Some labels rely entirely on playlisting to see if their campaign was a success or not. Put simply, it’s the only currency of note right now when releasing music digitally.\n\nPlaylists, whilst they can be fantastic and open your ears to wonderful new music (I’ve had [this one](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXbHcQpOiXk1D?si=91b80523cc6c4b09) on heavy repeat of late), are not conducive to providing the majority of artists with utility or growth in any real sense. \n\n## Passive Listening and Lost Fans\n\nPlaylists encourage passive listening. That in itself is fine, but most of the artists that feature on these playlists will get a boost in streams, perhaps a boost in followers, but not much else in terms of user retention. And even worse, when the playlists stop picking the track up, you haven’t gained much except a few hundred dollars and a few followers, who you can’t evaluate or measure on an individual basis.\n\nThe vast majority of people will listen passively whilst undergoing another task such as studying, driving, cooking, you name it, and will not actively follow the artist’s career after the track is done.\n\nThere is of course the odd instance where a track will resonate to the point where someone takes action. Spotify playlists can be a beautiful discovery tool, and some people will find an artist on Spotify and become massive fans. This would be a big win for the artist if Spotify didn’t withhold so much data from them, but unfortunately that is not the case.\n\n## The Gatekeeping of Data in Today’s Music Landscape\n\nI work with an artist who just released a single that got very nice pickup on Editorial Playlists. We released the track on the Tuesday and you can see that there was a significant boost on the Friday (when Spotify update their Playlists) and after that great first week, we’re seeing the dreaded slump begin after it has surely been removed from the big weekly playlists such as New Music Friday.\n\nThis is the extent of the data we get - we get details on the *amount* of streams but very little data on *who* is streaming the track.\n\nWe do get info on demographics - age group, gender, country etc, but we’re never told who listens to the music the most - the true fans - and this is the information that the artist needs the most.\n\nThose fans that do resonate with your art, and who come back day after day to listen, sign up to your newsletter and see when you’re playing in their town are kept at arms length from the artist.\n\nThe data that artists need that could really benefit their careers are to distinguish which fans are superfans. There is no way to single out superfans or ‘actively engaged’ fans from your passive listening fans, and Spotify like it this way. It means that they can continue to keep the playlist as their primary source of value to their shareholders (aka the larger labels).\n\n## Why Gatekeep Data?\n\nData is incredibly valuable for any industry, let alone one that is based almost entirely digitally such as non-live music consumption.\n\nThe data that Spotify collects is of huge value to the company themselves. They can see which tracks perform well, which artist is popping off on the platform, and they have focused detail on each user’s listening habits.\n\nThere is no incentive for Spotify to release all of their data to artists. That would allow the artist’s team to extract value from their follower-base off platform, something that isn’t aligned with Spotify’s corporate goals. I get it, they’re incentivized to keep people on the platform and they’re definitely incentivized to remain as the market leader.\n\nSpotify actually do a better job of letting the artist under the hood than any other of the major music streaming platforms. Apple Music have very limited back-end customization options to artists and their teams, and whilst Amazon have launched a comprehensive backend for artists, it is still in its early stages and not as slick as Spotify.\n\nPlus - very few people actually care about Apple, Amazon and Tidal and the other competitors when it comes to whether their music gets playlisted or not. In my experience, almost 100% of all efforts from labels and managers is based around Spotify, further centralizing the way in which music gets released. Not ideal, but the only currency right now in a mainstream way is the Spotify Editorial Playlist.\n\n## How Can Artists Get Their Data?\n\nA growing thesis regarding music and NFTs/Web 3 is that artists should now focus on quality over quantity, and they need a small number of superfans to sustain them, as opposed to many hundreds of thousands of anonymous streams, where the artist is beholden to centralized curators to be placed on large playlists.\n\nThe issue right now is how does the artist get access to data? It is tricky and requires a lot of middle-men.\n\nAn artist can promote an email list on social media, then can monitor the open rate of those subscribers who sign up, they can scan data from bandcamp or other online webstore interface to see where sales are coming in, and then start building a database of ‘superfans’ - those fans who are actively interested in the artist’s career and are a high worth fan.\n\nThere is a community building organization called [Indiepreneur](https://indepreneur.io/) who have been showing artists how to find their true fans, build a community and then monetize it. They have a suite of products and tools ([as well as a great podcast](https://indepreneur.io/podcast/)) which breaks down how to gain a certain sense of ownership of their data and their fan connection experience.\n\nThe issue with many of their tools is that they are reliant on focusing on ad spend to centralized gatekeepers (most frequently Meta through Instagram and Facebook), and this is a less than ideal situation for those hoping for an open transparent digital music landscape. That being said, they’re doing good work within the parameters that they have been given.\n\nThere are a myriad of Web 3 services and tools that are launching all the time that are geared towards giving the artist more power and control over their music and their data, but as of now they are so niche and small that they pose no immediate solution to the current state of the music industry as a whole.\n\n# Why Curation Needs To Decentralize\n\nThe fact that members of Spotify’s team are the ones who decide which music rises to the top and which music doesn’t is not good for the industry as a whole. \n\nAesthetically it’s not a good look in general, but it is made even worse by the fact that large centralized entities own some of Spotify, and these entities have a very significant interest on what music gets playlisted and championed. \n\nWhen Spotify was founded and was handing out percentages to the big recording companies, Sony BMG got 6%; Universal Music Group got 5%; Warner Music Group got 4%; EMI Music got 2%; Merlin got 1%.\n\nThat’s 18% of the platform’s stock, and therefore they have a say in how the platform is run, meaning they have control over the playlists - the main source of currency on Spotify. This is very centralized amongst a few large corporate entities. Not great.\n\nCollective ownership of Web 3 protocols will bring about an element of community curation that can allow a new way to discover new music without major label ownership influencing specific trends and artists.\n\nIt also (in theory) allows artists to own a much fairer share of the value they create and of the value the specific protocols create.\n\nThere is of course a risk to this, as all three major labels have recently started hiring for Web 3 related roles, meaning that they mean to partake in this new era of music, but the hope is that the protocols themselves will be built in such a way as no one or few entities can meaningfully manipulate or control the platform.\n\nTastemakers will emerge, but the hope is that these tastemakers will be individuals or collectives as opposed to conglomerates.\n\nThis is all speculation and somewhat utopian thinking, but if the legacy music world embraces a few of these new Web 3 platforms, the idea is that they are built in a trustless, transparent way that democratizes the listening and discovery experience, something that we don’t have today.\n\nWith all the buzz about music stepping into Web 3 (no better described by the consistently brilliant and thorough reporting of Water + Music in their most recent Season 2 drop on [music and the metaverse](https://stream.waterandmusic.com/#https://www.waterandmusic.com/9-design-principles-for-a-musical-metaverse/)), it remains to be seen if any of the platforms working on building a more decentralized online world can take a meaningful slice of market share from the legacy platforms.\n\nThat said, there is hopeful optimism that these new protocols and use cases can provide less centralized music curation & discovery, allowing people to follow individual tastemakers to show them new music, as opposed to a centralized entity. \n\nThe reality is that this is probably a long way off, but the optimistically speaking, it’s probably going to happen eventually.\n\nThank you for reading.

Get each article as it comes out by subscribing below.\n\nYou can subscribe to the newsletter here.\n\nI am an artist manager, and also run a small record label. The relationship I have with Spotify Playlists is one that I deem to be quite unhealthy, and yet it is something I spend a lot of my time on.\n\nWhenever one of our artists has a release coming out, I painstakingly pitch the track to Spotify’s backend *Spotify For Artists*, as well as doing up a more detailed pitch to my label’s distributor, who then (presumably) pitch to their direct contacts at the various DSPs (a DSP is a Digital Service Provider such as Spotify/Apple Music/Tidal etc).\n\nThe reason I and thousands of others do this is to get a shot at one of the most coveted prizes in modern music - *The Spotify Editorial Playlist*.\n\nWhat Are Spotify Editorial Playlists? They are official playlists curated by Spotify staff where thousands of people will hear new (or old) music for the first time.\n\nYou can always tell a Spotify Playlist as they are down as the owner of the playlist on the platform (think *Fresh Folk, Peaceful Piano, New Music Friday UK* etc).\n\nAs of today there are 1,520 official Spotify Playlists that serve every genre under the sun.\n\nLots of artists would be familiar with the *Spotify For Artists* backend, which is where they can make their pitch. It’s essentially a bite-sized sales pitch that you send into Spotify’s team in order to be considered for their Editorial Playlisting which typically updates every Friday.\n\nSometimes when you release music it gets picked up on these playlists and it can stay there for anything from a week to a few months. Fantastic! More people will listen to your music and hopefully resonate with it.\n\nSometimes however it doesn’t get chosen for these coveted playlists, and that can be devastating to an artist or a label. This is because in the current music release landscape, Spotify Editorial Playlisting is a central facet of nearly all ‘mainstream’ release strategies. Some labels rely entirely on playlisting to see if their campaign was a success or not. Put simply, it’s the only currency of note right now when releasing music digitally.\n\nPlaylists, whilst they can be fantastic and open your ears to wonderful new music (I’ve had [this one](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXbHcQpOiXk1D?si=91b80523cc6c4b09) on heavy repeat of late), are not conducive to providing the majority of artists with utility or growth in any real sense.\n\n## Passive Listening and Lost Fans\n\nPlaylists encourage passive listening. That in itself is fine, but most of the artists that feature on these playlists will get a boost in streams, perhaps a boost in followers, but not much else in terms of user retention. And even worse, when the playlists stop picking the track up, you haven’t gained much except a few hundred dollars and a few followers, who you can’t evaluate or measure on an individual basis.\n\nThe vast majority of people will listen passively whilst undergoing another task such as studying, driving, cooking, you name it, and will not actively follow the artist’s career after the track is done.\n\nThere is of course the odd instance where a track will resonate to the point where someone takes action.

I get it, they’re incentivized to keep people on the platform and they’re definitely incentivized to remain as the market leader.\n\nSpotify actually do a better job of letting the artist under the hood than any other of the major music streaming platforms. Apple Music have very limited back-end customization options to artists and their teams, and whilst Amazon have launched a comprehensive backend for artists, it is still in its early stages and not as slick as Spotify.\n\nPlus - very few people actually care about Apple, Amazon and Tidal and the other competitors when it comes to whether their music gets playlisted or not. In my experience, almost 100% of all efforts from labels and managers is based around Spotify, further centralizing the way in which music gets released. Not ideal, but the only currency right now in a mainstream way is the Spotify Editorial Playlist.\n\n## How Can Artists Get Their Data?\n\nA growing thesis regarding music and NFTs/Web 3 is that artists should now focus on quality over quantity, and they need a small number of superfans to sustain them, as opposed to many hundreds of thousands of anonymous streams, where the artist is beholden to centralized curators to be placed on large playlists.\n\nThe issue right now is how does the artist get access to data? It is tricky and requires a lot of middle-men.\n\nAn artist can promote an email list on social media, then can monitor the open rate of those subscribers who sign up, they can scan data from bandcamp or other online webstore interface to see where sales are coming in, and then start building a database of ‘superfans’ - those fans who are actively interested in the artist’s career and are a high worth fan.\n\nThere is a community building organization called [Indiepreneur](https://indepreneur.io/) who have been showing artists how to find their true fans, build a community and then monetize it. They have a suite of products and tools ([as well as a great podcast](https://indepreneur.io/podcast/)) which breaks down how to gain a certain sense of ownership of their data and their fan connection experience.\n\nThe issue with many of their tools is that they are reliant on focusing on ad spend to centralized gatekeepers (most frequently Meta through Instagram and Facebook), and this is a less than ideal situation for those hoping for an open transparent digital music landscape. That being said, they’re doing good work within the parameters that they have been given.\n\nThere are a myriad of Web 3 services and tools that are launching all the time that are geared towards giving the artist more power and control over their music and their data, but as of now they are so niche and small that they pose no immediate solution to the current state of the music industry as a whole.\n\n# Why Curation Needs To Decentralize\n\nThe fact that members of Spotify’s team are the ones who decide which music rises to the top and which music doesn’t is not good for the industry as a whole.\n\nAesthetically it’s not a good look in general, but it is made even worse by the fact that large centralized entities own some of Spotify, and these entities have a very significant interest on what music gets playlisted and championed.\n\nWhen Spotify was founded and was handing out percentages to the big recording companies, Sony BMG got 6%; Universal Music Group got 5%; Warner Music Group got 4%; EMI Music got 2%; Merlin got 1%.\n\nThat’s 18% of the platform’s stock, and therefore they have a say in how the platform is run, meaning they have control over the playlists - the main source of currency on Spotify. This is very centralized amongst a few large corporate entities. Not great.\n\nCollective ownership of Web 3 protocols will bring about an element of community curation that can allow a new way to discover new music without major label ownership influencing specific trends and artists.\n\nIt also (in theory) allows artists to own a much fairer share of the value they create and of the value the specific protocols create.\n\nThere is of course a risk to this, as all three major labels have recently started hiring for Web 3 related roles, meaning that they mean to partake in this new era of music, but the hope is that the protocols themselves will be built in such a way as no one or few entities can meaningfully manipulate or control the platform.\n\nTastemakers will emerge, but the hope is that these tastemakers will be individuals or collectives as opposed to conglomerates.\n\nThis is all speculation and somewhat utopian thinking, but if the legacy music world embraces a few of these new Web 3 platforms, the idea is that they are built in a trustless, transparent way that democratizes the listening and discovery experience, something that we don’t have today.\n\nWith all the buzz about music stepping into Web 3 (no better described by the consistently brilliant and thorough reporting of Water + Music in their most recent Season 2 drop on [music and the metaverse](https://stream.waterandmusic.com/#https://www.waterandmusic.com/9-design-principles-for-a-musical-metaverse/)), it remains to be seen if any of the platforms working on building a more decentralized online world can take a meaningful slice of market share from the legacy platforms.\n\nThat said, there is hopeful optimism that these new protocols and use cases can provide less centralized music curation & discovery, allowing people to follow individual tastemakers to show them new music, as opposed to a centralized entity.\n\nThe reality is that this is probably a long way off, but the optimistically speaking, it’s probably going to happen eventually.\n\nThank you for reading.

{"id": "phEv2qd-e37xjN3J7rHJz_y0pd66BCsoyT6H55YOyvk", "title": "O que é a Blockchain e como ela pode impactar a forma como interagimos com o mundo", "body": "A Blockchain é um tipo de tecnologia de [livro razão](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raz%C3%A3o_(contabilidade)) descentralizado, geralmente público, que pode ser entendido como uma base de dados aberta e distribuída. Como o nome em inglês sugere, ela usa uma série de blocos (\"block\") ligados em uma cadeia (\"chain\") por criptografia.\n\nEmbora a tecnologia da Blockchain ainda seja bastante nova, ela já começou a ter impacto na forma como interagimos com o mundo ao nosso redor. Uma das coisas mais importantes sobre esta nova tecnologia é que ela é descentralizada.\n\nUma Blockchain é mantida por uma rede de participantes (nós da rede) que chegam a um acordo sobre o status da rede (e transações realizadas) a partir de um mecanismo de consenso. Esse mecanismo diz respeito a como as redes estão seguras contra ataques e como os participantes chegaram a um acordo sobre um status para a rede.\n\nOs tipos mais comuns são a prova de trabalho (PoW, do inglês proof-of-work), usado pela rede Bitcoin e atualmente pela Ethereum (julho de 2022), e a prova de participação (PoS, do inglês proof-of-stake), usada, em geral, por plataformas de contratos inteligentes. Os tokens nestas redes são distribuídos aos participantes para que cumpram seu papel em assegurar a rede pelo mecanismo de consenso.\n\n![Fonte: https://cmte.ieee.org/futuredirections/2022/03/09/proof-of-stake-a-game-changer/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/em3zrricUcV52ZejXUzvT.jpg?height=1000&width=2000)\n\nEm tradução livre da imagem:\n\n**PoS (prova de participação)**, proprietários dos tokens da rede devem guardar uma quantidade mínima para se tornarem validadores. O contrato inteligente da Blockchain seleciona quem irá validar a transação, incluir um novo bloco na rede e receber a recompensa.\n\n**PoW (prova de trabalho)**, neste sistema apenas o primeiro validor que conseguir resolver a transação poderá incluir o novo bloco na rede e receber a recompensa por ele.\n\nEm relação ao custo de energia, enquanto PoW exige a utilização de hardwares especializados, com alta capacidade de processamento e gasto de energia, ainda há o fato da concorrência entre os validadores (mineradores), pois a cada transação apenas o primeiro a conseguir resolver é recompensado. Todos os demais que participaram gastaram tempo e processamento sem necessidade.\n\nJá no mecanismo PoS não há utilização de equipamentos e o consenso é administrado pelo contrato intelidente através dos validadores, que são os usuários que possuem uma determinada quantidade do token travado na rede.\n\nPor exemplo, no momento que publico esse artigo (julho de 2022) a rede Ethereum está em processo de migrar do mecanismo PoW para Pos. Para ser tornar um validador (nó da rede) do Etherium é preciso ter guardado na rede a quantidade mínima de 32 ETH, cerca de U$ 40 mil dólares (cotação de julho de 2022).\n\nDeixando a especulação financeira de lado, a tecnologia Blockchain é base das criptomoedas e da Web3, sendo um novo tipo de estrutura de dados de back-end.\n\nEssa nova arquitetura de dados teve origem em meados de 2009 (após a [crise finaceira do mercado imobiliário](https://www.politize.com.br/crise-financeira-de-2008/) americado de 2008), o que alegam ser uma das motivações de [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) – identidade utilizada pela pessoa (ou pessoas) que criaram o Bitcoin e a primeira Blockchain, com o objetivo de realizar transferências monetárias entre pessoas, sem intermediação de governos ou bancos, ou seja, um meio de pagamento digital e descentralizado.\n\nAtualmente há centenas de criptoativos (muitos com sua própria blockchain), contudo o Bitcoin ainda é o principal deste mercado e o único a manter sua finalidade de moeda digital (mesmo não sendo concretizada ainda).\n\nApesar de polêmico, o Bitcoin, a cada ano que passa, aumenta sua adesão por empresas, governos e até instituições financeiras, especialmente, como reserva de valor, amenizando a perda da inflação das moedas governamentais (como o nosso real), o que “rendeu” o apelido de ouro digital ao Bitcoin.\n\nDiferente do Bitcoin, algumas Blockchains são plataformas de contratos inteligentes. A pioneira nesse segmento e líder na quantidade de projetos desenvolvidos é a Ethereum.\n\nEnquanto o Bitcoin é comparado ao ouro, o Ethereum pode ser comparado ao ferro, pois é matéria-prima para a construção de algo novo. Há centenas de projetos desenvolvidos sobre a plataforma de contratato inteligente da Ethereum.\n\nEssas plataformas também são chamadas de \"redes de primeira camada\" e, além da Ethereum, outros projetos estão incluídos como Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Luna, Tezos e mais. Os aplicativos criados nessas redes são conhecidos como aplicativos descentralizados (dApps).\n\n**Outros dois movimentos aumentaram o interesse do mercado pelas criptomoedas: finanças descentralizadas (DeFi) e os tokens não fungíveis (NFTs).**\n\nAs DeFi são um conjunto de aplicativos que oferecem aos usuários um serviço de finanças descentralizadas, como empréstimo, crédito, derivados e outros a partir de criptomoedas baseadas em blockchain.\n\nConfira [neste artigo mais detalhes sobre que são os NFTs](https://mirror.xyz/0x8A86d40E449Fecf1C0daF52CF73193D0eB05f703/KxI5YwDAl_NmBX_kKbk1xIc-cFhqRXEdCSxvLCDJkME).", "timestamp": 1658188851, "digest": "fz8mo6yKofkTD27Ygxu-ge7qqWdqN0qR17Uowm5MOwo", "contributor": "0x8A86d40E449Fecf1C0daF52CF73193D0eB05f703"}

Vamos destacar suas diferenças e características.\n\n**Tokens fungíveis** são as principais criptomoedas, por exemplo, Bitcoin e Ethereum são ativos nativos, essenciais para o funcionamento de suas respectivas redes descentralizadas, enquanto outras são criadas a partir de plataformas de contrato inteligente pré-existentes, sendo a Ethereum a principal plataforma no momento.\n\n![Fonte: https://medium.com/@dan_zaitsev/top-blockchains-to-develop-dapps-in-2022-21c5b30635f1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OFMq5Qkpi_T-oQ-6ulVdk.png?height=445&width=700)\n\nAlém da Ethereum outras Blockchains concorrem no mercado de Web3 como soluções para desenvolvimento de [dApps](https://coinext.com.br/blog/o-que-sao-dapps). Cada Blockchain apresenta pontos distintos em relação as três características que forma uma rede: descentralização, segurança e escalabilidade.\n\nAinda não temos uma tecnologia em Blockchain que atenda esses três itens de forma plena, e acredito que o mercado irá avançar para Blockchains especializadas conforme a necessidade do serviço.\n\nJá os **NFTs - Tokens Não Fungíveis** são unidades únicas que podem ser usados para representar uma propriedade digital. Deferente dos tokens fungíveis (criptomoedas), os NFTs não são intercambiáveis. Cada NFT é único e só pode existir em uma carteira de cada vez. Contudo, pode ser transferido entre usuários e vendido, o que assegura a titularidade digital.\n\nAlém da arte, os NFTs também impactaram os mercados da música, jogos, eventos, entre outras categorias por permitirem novos modelos de monetização para os criadores e propriedade digitais para fãs e compradores desse token.\n\nEntre 2020 e 2021 os jogos NFTs e Blockchain atraíram cerca de [US$ 4 bilhões em investimentos](https://gamedaily.biz/article/2227/report-2021-was-a-record-breaking-year-for-gaming-deals-drake-star), na categoria de jogos [play-to-earn](https://canaltech.com.br/games/o-que-sao-jogos-play-to-earn/).\n\nAinda não sabemos se os NFTs vão ter sucesso nessa categoria de jogos, mas, com o aumento de investimentos em inciativas Web3 e considerando o abrangência de uso da propriedade digital e certificado de autenticidade viabilizada através dos NFTs, a adesão a esses tokens deve continuar a crescer nos próximos anos.\n\nMarketplaces de NFT fomentaram o mercado permitindo aos usuários criar (mintar) NFTs de graça, só gerando o registro na blockchain quando alguém realizar a compra. Conhecido pelo termos “lazy mint” (cunhagem preguiçosa) evita o pagamento da taxa na blockchain (gas) no momento da criação.\n\nPara entender mais sobre como funciona uma Blockchain leia essa artigo [O que é a Blockchain e como ela pode impactar a forma como interagimos com o mundo](https://mirror.xyz/0x8A86d40E449Fecf1C0daF52CF73193D0eB05f703/N0xvPdyYdNMLnPdwxtwLKKJAyM4sfy0O_Hw_Sv80tGo).", "timestamp": 1658188810, "digest": "8rXjxmSNlE-QIcf9Tupoap8yRUXGw3gN5agWYSLYcQk", "contributor": "0x8A86d40E449Fecf1C0daF52CF73193D0eB05f703"}
{"id": "XhnESzS-CYAKjM2uekwMKoZzZLlc9gk4Zwll-kbk1ZQ", "title": "The Depressing Role That Editorial Playlists Have in Today's Music Landscape & Why Curation Needs To Decentralize", "body": "Thank you for visiting. You can subscribe to the newsletter [here](https://blanksats.substack.com/).\n\nI am an artist manager, and also run a small record label. The relationship I have with Spotify Playlists is one that I deem to be quite unhealthy, and yet it is something I spend a lot of my time on.\n\nWhenever one of our artists has a release coming out, I painstakingly pitch the track to Spotify’s backend *Spotify For Artists*, as well as doing up a more detailed pitch to my label’s distributor, who then (presumably) pitch to their direct contacts at the various DSPs (a DSP is a Digital Service Provider such as Spotify/Apple Music/Tidal etc).\n\nThe reason I and thousands of others do this is to get a shot at one of the most coveted prizes in modern music - *The Spotify Editorial Playlist*.\n\nWhat Are Spotify Editorial Playlists? They are official playlists curated by Spotify staff where thousands of people will hear new (or old) music for the first time.\n\nYou can always tell a Spotify Playlist as they are down as the owner of the playlist on the platform (think *Fresh Folk, Peaceful Piano, New Music Friday UK* etc).\n\nAs of today there are 1,520 official Spotify Playlists that serve every genre under the sun.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PtuiAYlc46uuUv_OkjykC.jpg?height=803&width=1456)\n\nLots of artists would be familiar with the *Spotify For Artists* backend, which is where they can make their pitch. It’s essentially a bite-sized sales pitch that you send into Spotify’s team in order to be considered for their Editorial Playlisting which typically updates every Friday.\n\nSometimes when you release music it gets picked up on these playlists and it can stay there for anything from a week to a few months. Fantastic! More people will listen to your music and hopefully resonate with it.\n\nSometimes however it doesn’t get chosen for these coveted playlists, and that can be devastating to an artist or a label. This is because in the current music release landscape, Spotify Editorial Playlisting is a central facet of nearly all ‘mainstream’ release strategies. Some labels rely entirely on playlisting to see if their campaign was a success or not. Put simply, it’s the only currency of note right now when releasing music digitally.\n\nPlaylists, whilst they can be fantastic and open your ears to wonderful new music (I’ve had [this one](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXbHcQpOiXk1D?si=91b80523cc6c4b09) on heavy repeat of late), are not conducive to providing the majority of artists with utility or growth in any real sense.\n\n## Passive Listening and Lost Fans\n\nPlaylists encourage passive listening. That in itself is fine, but most of the artists that feature on these playlists will get a boost in streams, perhaps a boost in followers, but not much else in terms of user retention. And even worse, when the playlists stop picking the track up, you haven’t gained much except a few hundred dollars and a few followers, who you can’t evaluate or measure on an individual basis.\n\nThe vast majority of people will listen passively whilst undergoing another task such as studying, driving, cooking, you name it, and will not actively follow the artist’s career after the track is done.\n\nThere is of course the odd instance where a track will resonate to the point where someone takes action. Spotify playlists can be a beautiful discovery tool, and some people will find an artist on Spotify and become massive fans. This would be a big win for the artist if Spotify didn’t withhold so much data from them, but unfortunately that is not the case.\n\n## The Gatekeeping of Data in Today’s Music Landscape\n\nI work with an artist who just released a single that got very nice pickup on Editorial Playlists. We released the track on the Tuesday and you can see that there was a significant boost on the Friday (when Spotify update their Playlists) and after that great first week, we’re seeing the dreaded slump begin after it has surely been removed from the big weekly playlists such as New Music Friday.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g0Pu8KqBjdrbl2JCK52mb.jpg?height=465&width=1456)\n\nThis is the extent of the data we get - we get details on the *amount* of streams but very little data on *who* is streaming the track.\n\nWe do get info on demographics - age group, gender, country etc, but we’re never told who listens to the music the most - the true fans - and this is the information that the artist needs the most.\n\nThose fans that do resonate with your art, and who come back day after day to listen, sign up to your newsletter and see when you’re playing in their town are kept at arms length from the artist.\n\nThe data that artists need that could really benefit their careers are to distinguish which fans are superfans. There is no way to single out superfans or ‘actively engaged’ fans from your passive listening fans, and Spotify like it this way. It means that they can continue to keep the playlist as their primary source of value to their shareholders (aka the larger labels).\n\n## Why Gatekeep Data?\n\nData is incredibly valuable for any industry, let alone one that is based almost entirely digitally such as non-live music consumption.\n\nThe data that Spotify collects is of huge value to the company themselves. They can see which tracks perform well, which artist is popping off on the platform, and they have focused detail on each user’s listening habits.\n\nThere is no incentive for Spotify to release all of their data to artists. That would allow the artist’s team to extract value from their follower-base off platform, something that isn’t aligned with Spotify’s corporate goals. I get it, they’re incentivized to keep people on the platform and they’re definitely incentivized to remain as the market leader.\n\nSpotify actually do a better job of letting the artist under the hood than any other of the major music streaming platforms.

That in itself is fine, but most of the artists that feature on these playlists will get a boost in streams, perhaps a boost in followers, but not much else in terms of user retention. And even worse, when the playlists stop picking the track up, you haven’t gained much except a few hundred dollars and a few followers, who you can’t evaluate or measure on an individual basis.\n\nThe vast majority of people will listen passively whilst undergoing another task such as studying, driving, cooking, you name it, and will not actively follow the artist’s career after the track is done.\n\nThere is of course the odd instance where a track will resonate to the point where someone takes action. Spotify playlists can be a beautiful discovery tool, and some people will find an artist on Spotify and become massive fans. This would be a big win for the artist if Spotify didn’t withhold so much data from them, but unfortunately that is not the case.\n\n## The Gatekeeping of Data in Today’s Music Landscape\n\nI work with an artist who just released a single that got very nice pickup on Editorial Playlists. We released the track on the Tuesday and you can see that there was a significant boost on the Friday (when Spotify update their Playlists) and after that great first week, we’re seeing the dreaded slump begin after it has surely been removed from the big weekly playlists such as New Music Friday.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g0Pu8KqBjdrbl2JCK52mb.jpg?height=465&width=1456)\n\nThis is the extent of the data we get - we get details on the *amount* of streams but very little data on *who* is streaming the track.\n\nWe do get info on demographics - age group, gender, country etc, but we’re never told who listens to the music the most - the true fans - and this is the information that the artist needs the most.\n\nThose fans that do resonate with your art, and who come back day after day to listen, sign up to your newsletter and see when you’re playing in their town are kept at arms length from the artist.\n\nThe data that artists need that could really benefit their careers are to distinguish which fans are superfans. There is no way to single out superfans or ‘actively engaged’ fans from your passive listening fans, and Spotify like it this way. It means that they can continue to keep the playlist as their primary source of value to their shareholders (aka the larger labels).\n\n## Why Gatekeep Data?\n\nData is incredibly valuable for any industry, let alone one that is based almost entirely digitally such as non-live music consumption.\n\nThe data that Spotify collects is of huge value to the company themselves. They can see which tracks perform well, which artist is popping off on the platform, and they have focused detail on each user’s listening habits.\n\nThere is no incentive for Spotify to release all of their data to artists. That would allow the artist’s team to extract value from their follower-base off platform, something that isn’t aligned with Spotify’s corporate goals. I get it, they’re incentivized to keep people on the platform and they’re definitely incentivized to remain as the market leader.\n\nSpotify actually do a better job of letting the artist under the hood than any other of the major music streaming platforms. Apple Music have very limited back-end customization options to artists and their teams, and whilst Amazon have launched a comprehensive backend for artists, it is still in its early stages and not as slick as Spotify.\n\nPlus - very few people actually care about Apple, Amazon and Tidal and the other competitors when it comes to whether their music gets playlisted or not. In my experience, almost 100% of all efforts from labels and managers is based around Spotify, further centralizing the way in which music gets released. Not ideal, but the only currency right now in a mainstream way is the Spotify Editorial Playlist.\n\n## How Can Artists Get Their Data?\n\nA growing thesis regarding music and NFTs/Web 3 is that artists should now focus on quality over quantity, and they need a small number of superfans to sustain them, as opposed to many hundreds of thousands of anonymous streams, where the artist is beholden to centralized curators to be placed on large playlists.\n\nThe issue right now is how does the artist get access to data? It is tricky and requires a lot of middle-men.\n\nAn artist can promote an email list on social media, then can monitor the open rate of those subscribers who sign up, they can scan data from bandcamp or other online webstore interface to see where sales are coming in, and then start building a database of ‘superfans’ - those fans who are actively interested in the artist’s career and are a high worth fan.\n\nThere is a community building organization called [Indiepreneur](https://indepreneur.io/) who have been showing artists how to find their true fans, build a community and then monetize it. They have a suite of products and tools ([as well as a great podcast](https://indepreneur.io/podcast/)) which breaks down how to gain a certain sense of ownership of their data and their fan connection experience.\n\nThe issue with many of their tools is that they are reliant on focusing on ad spend to centralized gatekeepers (most frequently Meta through Instagram and Facebook), and this is a less than ideal situation for those hoping for an open transparent digital music landscape. That being said, they’re doing good work within the parameters that they have been given.\n\nThere are a myriad of Web 3 services and tools that are launching all the time that are geared towards giving the artist more power and control over their music and their data, but as of now they are so niche and small that they pose no immediate solution to the current state of the music industry as a whole.\n\n# Why Curation Needs To Decentralize\n\nThe fact that members of Spotify’s team are the ones who decide which music rises to the top and which music doesn’t is not good for the industry as a whole.\n\nAesthetically it’s not a good look in general, but it is made even worse by the fact that large centralized entities own some of Spotify, and these entities have a very significant interest on what music gets playlisted and championed.\n\nWhen Spotify was founded and was handing out percentages to the big recording companies, Sony BMG got 6%; Universal Music Group got 5%; Warner Music Group got 4%; EMI Music got 2%; Merlin got 1%.\n\nThat’s 18% of the platform’s stock, and therefore they have a say in how the platform is run, meaning they have control over the playlists - the main source of currency on Spotify. This is very centralized amongst a few large corporate entities. Not great.\n\nCollective ownership of Web 3 protocols will bring about an element of community curation that can allow a new way to discover new music without major label ownership influencing specific trends and artists.\n\nIt also (in theory) allows artists to own a much fairer share of the value they create and of the value the specific protocols create.\n\nThere is of course a risk to this, as all three major labels have recently started hiring for Web 3 related roles, meaning that they mean to partake in this new era of music, but the hope is that the protocols themselves will be built in such a way as no one or few entities can meaningfully manipulate or control the platform.\n\nTastemakers will emerge, but the hope is that these tastemakers will be individuals or collectives as opposed to conglomerates.\n\nThis is all speculation and somewhat utopian thinking, but if the legacy music world embraces a few of these new Web 3 platforms, the idea is that they are built in a trustless, transparent way that democratizes the listening and discovery experience, something that we don’t have today.\n\nWith all the buzz about music stepping into Web 3 (no better described by the consistently brilliant and thorough reporting of Water + Music in their most recent Season 2 drop on [music and the metaverse](https://stream.waterandmusic.com/#https://www.waterandmusic.com/9-design-principles-for-a-musical-metaverse/)), it remains to be seen if any of the platforms working on building a more decentralized online world can take a meaningful slice of market share from the legacy platforms.\n\nThat said, there is hopeful optimism that these new protocols and use cases can provide less centralized music curation & discovery, allowing people to follow individual tastemakers to show them new music, as opposed to a centralized entity.\n\nThe reality is that this is probably a long way off, but the optimistically speaking, it’s probably going to happen eventually.\n\nThank you for reading.

#Crypto*\n\n*作者：[Patric](https://p.mirror.xyz/)｜翻译：[Sig](https://twitter.com/sigridsss)｜校对：Dave｜排版：[zik](https://twitter.com/zikNoNumber)*\n\n\n---\n\n在创业公司工作很酷的一点是，你可以身兼多职。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/v1IJq0z8Jk6YntxxbQMuu.png?height=1050&width=1400)\n\n本周我最喜欢的部分之一，是与创作者们讨论他们如何通过加密世界来建立更强大的社区。\n\n在未来，我认为加密技术会成为每一位创作者业务的核心部分，类似于今天的科技产品依靠人工智能来保持竞争力。\n\n但我们仍处在很早期的阶段，所以在今天，加密世界到底有什么好处？在本文中，我们将介绍一个我与创作者分享的一个框架——即如何思考加密世界的前景。\n\n顺便一提，当我谈及「创作者」的时候，我指的是「[任何在科技平台上从事非商品化工作的人](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1350863079425376258)」，包括作家、社交网络网红、数字艺术家、音乐人、播客主及线上教师等等。\n\n好啦！现在我们一起来看看给这些想尝试进入加密世界的创作者的一些建议吧！\n\n## 建议 #1：首先，关注创作者的市场匹配度\n\n创作者就是他们自己的迷你创业公司。他们负责专注于一个细分领域、理解客户需求、创造一些人们喜爱的东西，并且找到可持续发展的方法。\n\n在创业公司，「产品市场匹配度」（product market fit）被公认是持续发展的[关键](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html)，产品市场匹配度在满意的客户、新客户和利润之间创造了一个正反馈循环。\n\n对于创作者而言，这个概念相当于[创作者市场匹配度](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1376393732610785283)。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KGNwON1pve6Htt3ijkjOb.png?height=848&width=1452)\n\n在关注增长之前，创作者们应当首先找到创作者市场匹配度，因为这将成为可持续事业的基础。当一位创作者达到了创作者市场匹配度，这时候开始尝试利用加密技术来促进增长才是有意义的。\n\n加密技术是一个强大的增长工具，但它不能取代创作者市场匹配度。\n\n## 建议 #2：开始利用加密世界作为变现工具\n\n当一位创作者觉得自己达到了创作者市场匹配度，就该考虑如何利用加密技术来建立一个可持续的业务。\n\n加密技术可以在以下四个方面帮助创作者：\n\n* **融资**：「帮我的项目筹集资金。」\n* **获客**：「帮我获得更多社区成员。」\n* **参与**：「帮我使现有的社区成员更多地参与进来。」\n* **变现**：「帮我赚钱」\n\n因此，作为一位精神饱满、准备好跳入加密兔子洞的创作者，应该从哪里开始？嗯……加密世界不是注册一个新的 SaaS（译者注：Software as a Service，软件即服务）产品。相反，它更像是构建一个迷你经济体。\n\n经济体有货币、法律、治理、商品和服务、市场，以及公民，等等。\n\n加密技术给予了创作者工具，让他们可以用这些组件来建立自己的经济体。但是，就像任何一个好的创业公司一样，创作者应当巧妙地进行小规模迭代。\n\n在创作者借助加密技术的所有方式中，我认为，专注于把加密技术作为一个变现工具是一个最好的开始，原因如下：\n\n* **专注于变现，可以使创造者有能力生产链上商品**。商品和服务是生产性经济的核心引擎，因为它们创造了资源来再次投资以促进增长。我看到许多创作者代币的一个问题是——他们推出了代币，但不生产任何链上商品。他们的大部分收入都在链外，所以他们的焦点就仅限于此。\n* **链上商品可以促使社区成员下载一个加密钱包，购买 ETH，然后在链上向创作者进行支付**。说服社区成员去下载加密钱包并购买 ETH 是创作者实验加密技术的最大障碍之一。我认为，如果你的社区最后能买到一个很酷的 NFT，那么说服他们去参加一个学习加密技术的头脑风暴会就容易多了。\n* **链上现金流为其他实验提供了一个坚实的基础**。随着你卖出越多的数字商品，你也开始积累了一个链上金库。这个金库可以用于资助实验，例如去中心化的投资基金、代币持有人的奖励计划、与其他原生加密创作者的协作等等。这些实验创造了一个积极的正反馈循环，让金库更有价值，并可以为未来的项目提供更多资源。\n\n此外，创作者也可以把原生加密变现看作是自己产品组合的一部分。\n\nWeb2 通过内容、课程和社区这样的付费墙可以很好地将人的稀缺性变现，Web2 也可以通过广告很好地将注意力变现。但正如我们所见，广告平台严重偏爱大型创作者，并针对某些参与度指标进行优化，但这些指标并不总是符合内容消费者的最佳利益。赞助是另一种选择，但它们可能需要大量的观众和一堆无聊的行政工作。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vA9SXF2PvYLwh_5Hh4EMa.png?height=1080&width=1440)\n\nNFT 为创作者提供了一个新的变现渠道，补充了现有渠道。NFT 不是将访问或注意力进行变现，而是对所有权进行变现。\n\n通过数学、计算机科学和密码学，区块链上的数字商品可以有一个单一的所有者。这基本上就是 NFT 的概念，数字商品存在于链上并且被人所拥有。更广泛地说，[NFT 使得互联网可以被拥有](https://variant.mirror.xyz/T8kdtZRIgy_srXB5B06L8vBqFHYlEBcv6ae2zR6Y_eo)。因此，那些超级粉丝们会愿意购买他们喜爱的创作者的 NFT，因为这是历史上第一次他们可以真正拥有一个数字商品，就像你在鞋柜里有一双耐克鞋。只要你是合法购买的，耐克公司就无法破门而入夺走这双鞋，这是属于你的鞋子。同样地，现在 NFT 提供了一种数字原生的产权形式。\n\n随着可扩展性解决方案降低了交易费用，以及更多基础设施的建立，我相信 NFT 将会带来所有权之外的其他更多好处。\n\n最终，创作者会想出区块链原生的商业模式，如[可编程订阅](https://medium.com/superfluid-blog/the-dawn-of-programmable-cashflows-2d50edae05cb)、[预测市场](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1309078385369460741?lang=en)、[代币奖励计划](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641)、投资其他创作者，等等。\n\n同时，今天的创作者也可以通过以下几种方式将 NFT 变现。\n\n***1 of 1 NFT***\n\n要让这种模式发挥作用，你只需要一个真正的粉丝，但也导致了这种模式的主要缺点——只有一个拥有者。因此很难围绕这些 NFT 创建一个社区，因为只有一个人拥有它。同时，这种模式也把那些不愿意在 NFT 上花费一生积蓄的消费者排除在外。\n\n***限量供应的 NFT drops 附带收藏者奖励***\n\n这一模式还未被充分探索。我认为 3LAU 是做得最好的例子。通过这种模式，你发布一些 NFT，并向任何出价的人提供奖励。这创造了一个社区，更多人可以参与其中，并且保留了一定的稀缺性。我认为这种模式在发布如专辑、书籍、电影等大型创意项时最有效，因为它可以创造一种美妙的数字体验，在项目的价值和 NFT 之间产生一个正反馈循环。\n\n***分散的 NFT***\n\n我认为这将在某个时候成为主流模式。这种模式有许多种变化，但一般是采取一个 NFT，并允许人们购买可以代表这个 NFT 的可替换的代币。代币持有者可以通过交易代币来对 NFT 的价值进行投机，他们也可以通过持有 NFT 来获得独家奖励，或者灵活运用。这种模式主要的好处是，它让人们可以拥有你的 NFT 的一部分。这可以为一个有良好激励的社区播下种子。这里的设计空间相当广泛，所以，我相信在未来几个月我们会看到各种各样的实验。\n\n我们仍处于早期阶段，但值得你去花时间来尝试不同的变现模型，以了解哪种模式更适合你想建立的社区类型。\n\n一旦你开始通过 NFT 创造链上的现金流收益，下一步就是社区治理。\n\n## 通过去中心化治理提高社区参与度和留存度\n\n去中心化治理是加密网络的另一个杀手锏。今天，创作者和他们社区的关系基本上是单向的。创作者发布内容，他们的社区来消费内容，也许会有一些聊天群，但也仅此而己。\n\n我相信加密网络将迎来一个共同创作的新时代。创作者将会让社区参与他们的关键决策，例如如何分配资金、谁可以加入、他们应当从事什么类型的项目，等等。这种共同创作的模式将会推动留存度的提升，长期来看，有助于打造更强大的社区。\n\n以下是在今天创作者可以让其社区参与关键决策的几种方式。\n\n***社区主导的资本分配***\n\n一旦创作者开始产生链上收入，他们可以在社区的帮助下重新分配资金。一个选择是创建一个投资基金，让社区成员赚取代币，他们用代币来投票决定基金应该购买哪些数字资产。数字资产可以包括 NFT，[NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) moments，[Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) 的地块，或 DeFi 协议的代币。去中心化投资基金的一个例子是 [FlamingoDAO](https://docs.flamingodao.xyz/)。[Cooper Turley](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa) 有[一篇很不错的帖子](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/A16NP2XXi9RdHptfdF9WHR0Xq_E1XDmUgMwPmJYOG7w)，解释了这些去中心化投资基金的潜力。\n\n另一个选择是创建一个拨款计划，根据对社区的潜在影响，由社区成员来决定资助的项目。去中心化金融（DeFi）协议，如 Uniswap、AAVE 和 Compound 都有社区驱动的拨款计划，用于改善其核心协议。\n\n最后，社区还可以投票决定金库中多少比例的资金应该归社区成员所有。例如，$UNI 持有者可以投票决定是否开启 0.05% 的[协议费开关](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-flip-the-protocol-fee-switch-for-uniswap-dev-team-and-uni-holders/4777)。\n\n***以民主的方式增加新的社区成员***\n\n吸收新成员加入社区通常有两种方式。一种方式是有一个不透明的流程，由少数几个人决定谁被允许加入；另一种方式是开放的社区，但是会导致作恶和破坏社区氛围。\n\n通过去中心化治理，社区可以进行自我调节，集体决定谁能加入组织。\n\n举个例子，在 Mirror，我们每周要以社区驱动的方式让 10 位新成员加入，这被称为 [$WRITE Race](https://mirror.xyz/race)。正式的 Mirror 作者从 1000 票开始，潜在的成员从 10 票开始。每个人都有两个小时的时间来投票，每周排名前十的人将被空投一个 $WRITE 代币，他们可以销毁代币并获得访问 Mirror 的权限。\n\n诚然，我们仍可以做很多事情来改善（如给人一个写简述的机会，来描述他们会用 Mirror 来做什么；尝试用二次投票来防止对一个人的大量投票；给予潜在成员获得更多选票的方法；把投票系统变成一个预测市场，来激励人们投票给为 Mirror 协议提供最大价值的人；创建一个 DAO 来设置投票参数等等）。\n\n不管怎么说，$WRITE Race 已经将入职从一个中心化的和需要许可的过程，变成了一个社区驱动的过程。\n\n随着越来越多的去中心化治理工具被建立起来，我认为它将成为社区在线做决策的默认方式。\n\n## 通过众筹为项目提供资金\n\n然而，我也相信这些限制正在阻止许多有才华的人获得资本，去建立他们的伟大事业。需要有某种中间地带。以下是我认为创作者应该考虑使用加密货币为创意项目融资的几个原因。\n\n***全局性与无需许可的访问***\n\n为原生的加密众筹基金做贡献，你只需要一个以太坊地址，而没有司法要求，也没有最低资产净值要求。只需要一台电脑、网络连接，以及一个有 ETH 或其他 ERC20 代币的加密钱包。\n\n***可编程的所有权***\n\n在 Kickstarter 或 GoFundMe 上参与众筹，大部分时候你只会得到一种温暖的感觉，即你为有意义的事情做出了贡献。当然，这一点是超级重要的！不幸的是，许多人宁愿把他们的资金花在其他可以产生回报的资产上，无论是经济层面的还是社会层面的。\n\n在以太坊上的众筹，贡献者不仅仅能获得一种温暖的感觉或者一个车尾贴，他们还可以收到 ERC20 代币。这种代币可以被编程，这带来了很多好处，包括访问在线社区的权限、分配资金的治理权、众筹基金产生的资产的使用费，甚至可能是一个你可以在你的加密货币钱包中展示的很酷的徽章，或者是你可以在视频游戏中穿戴的虚拟商品。\n\n最主要的收获是，加密网络开创了一个可编程所有权的新时代，它可以作为一个工具，围绕资本进行更好的激励调整。\n\n***经济图表***\n\nWeb 1.0 是关于信息的链接（网页），Web 2.0 是关于社交的链接（例如点赞、订阅、分享），Web 3.0 是关于经济的链接（你赚取的代币、你做出的投资、你拥有的资产）。（[来源](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1373809410485719045)）我认为将出现的最酷的产品之一是 「创作者的加密原生 [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/)」。例如，如果你去到 [Crunchbase 上的 Instacart 页面](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/instacart)，你可以看到他们的融资总额、投资者数量、谁是他们的投资者、他们分配了多少份额，以及其他一堆信息。\n\n有了加密原生众筹，我们可以看到任何创意项目都会出现类似的情况，随着下一代社交产品建立在加密轨道上，我相信创作者将使用某种去中心化的众筹来为他们的项目筹资。如果是这样，你将会看到下一个 [Mr. Beast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA) 或 [Cardi B](https://www.instagram.com/iamcardib/) 的完整资产结构表，并根据这些经济图表来构建产品。\n\n然而，去中心化的众筹也有风险，因为没有中心化的一方来监管。为限制诈骗风险，我认为我们可以开发一些类似于链上 KYC（译者注：实名认证）的程序。要向众筹基金捐款，你需要提交你的公钥，并限制只能捐献你净资产的一定比例。\n\n为筹集资金，你将从一个低的资金上限（例如 1 万美元）开始，并通过某些指标，在系统内建立信誉，然后才能筹集更大的金额。\n\n到目前为止，我们已经介绍了加密技术如何帮助创作者变现、参与和融资，现在我们来看看它能如何帮助你获得新的社区成员。\n\n## 通过代币奖励推动获客\n\n为推动获客，DeFi 协议采用了一种被称为 「[流动性挖矿](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/liquidity-mining-a-user-centric-token-distribution-strategy-1d05c5174641)」的策略，这只是「奖励项目」的另一种更炫酷的说法。但是协议不提供现金奖励，而是用他们的协议代币来激励用户。\n\n对于创作者而言，我更愿意称之为「代币奖励」项目，因为它更直观一些。代币奖励是如此强大，以至于为了更好地理解它，人们开发了一个[全新的研究领域](https://ce.mit.edu/)，称为加密经济学。\n\n一个有点吓人的加密经济学的定义是：「通过精心设计的激励措施对人类行为进行编程」（[来源](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCFlGLbI_kE)）。\n\n这很强有力。在 Web2 我们已经看到，如果不仔细制定激励机制，网上会发生什么样的糟糕情况。我们对自己进行激励设计机制的教育是很重要的，这样我们能够有意识地创造新的系统来奖励积极的总体行为。\n\n这里有一个框架，可以帮助创作者思考如何设计一个代币奖励项目：\n\n1. **明确你的社区目标**。是要发展更深的社会联系？还是提高某项技能？是找到一个更好的工作？还是赚钱？\n2. **选择一个奖励机制**。在加密网络，这通常是可编程代币。\n3. **选择一种有益于网络的正和奖励**。这包括去中心化治理中的投票、获得独家体验，甚至是经济奖励。\n\n（如果你想要更深入了解这个主题，请查看 [Token Engineering 101](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/library-te-101/)）\n\n加密技术带来了强大的工具以帮助人们进行协作。创作者可以利用这些工具，来确保他们的社区可以纠正社交网络在以前的网络时代所犯的错误。\n\n## 最后的思考\n\n加密技术是这个世界上最激动人心的技术之一。在过去的十年里，它已经从一个可爱的科学小实验，发展成为了一个真的有点重要的东西。在未来十年，我坚信它将成为我们生活中不可或缺的一部分。\n\n但作为一个在今天试图谋生的创作者，重要的是要务实。\n\n首先，专注于达到创作者市场匹配度，这将成为一个可持续事业的基础。接下来，慢慢地使用这些超牛的加密工具开展实验。在高层次上，加密技术可以帮助创作者进行融资、获客、参与和变现。\n\n在战术层面上，一种选择是先通过 NFT 产生链上的现金流，创作者可以通过 1 of 1的、分散化的、或是分层奖励的限量发行来进行实验。另一个选择是创建一个由社区驱动的治理系统，以帮助提高参与度和留存度。创作者也可以尝试为一个创意项目进行众筹，并给予贡献者可编程的所有权。创作者甚至可以设计一个代币奖励计划，以激励成员在社区内的正和行为。\n\n无论你已经在加密领域工作了十年，还是上周刚刚下载了 Metamask，我们都还在试图弄清楚这些东西，但这正是它的有趣之处。\n\n\n---\n\n原文：\n\n[https://p.mirror.xyz/WQQywdjjfnksMRPMaNKBMxPBqfE5k8nL6pCLe1roGyw](https://p.mirror.xyz/WQQywdjjfnksMRPMaNKBMxPBqfE5k8nL6pCLe1roGyw)\n\n\n---\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DKLQUW9u6ALsPYQH-DXOG.png?height=733&width=600)\n\n",

X先生是谁，他是一位加密圈的OG，应该不想被知道是谁吧，所以就z暂叫他X吧。\n\n### 埋下的一颗种子\n\n我一直迟迟没有行动，因为我觉得这个世界对于我来说太陌生了，我和crypto唯一的接触仅限于2019年用火币买过一些币，还是用人民币买的，那时的我连小狐狸钱包是什么都不知道。从来没有用过twitter，也没有用过opensea ,更不知道什么是discord。何况我的英文也不好，加密世界对我来说遥不可及，我觉得发NFT对我来说，简直难于登天。 某一天，朋友在微信朋友圈分享了一个twitter space的链接，我好奇点了进去，大家在聊什么链，什么二层协议，我什么都没听懂，然后退了出来。也就是那天，我注册了推特，正式进入了web3，那天是2021年12月30日。\n\n我打了退堂鼓，我发现twitter上人人都英文很流利，聊着我听不懂的话题和技术术语，直到2月10日那天，我看到史中老师发布在公众号的一篇文章“NFT精神史：罐头，青蛙，和平凡人的15分钟英雄梦想”，我觉得这篇文章太浪漫了，深深的打动了我，你们可能不会理解，我看这篇文章看哭了。对于我这种又浪漫又理想主义的人来说，NFT也许真的是每一个平凡人的机会？如果我能通过Nft来拯救他人呢？\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/70f50f9ef3898ec3.jpg)\n\n## 一个爱与英雄的虚拟城市-2077朋克猫之城\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/3b3a8d404867dde2.jpg)\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/182929274877b612.jpg)\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/85fe97c72005989b.jpg)\n\n我想，为什么我不能在Web3里构建一座虚拟的城市呢？让平凡的普通人也有机会当英雄，看了那么多漫威，DC的电影，里面构建了那么多英雄人物却是虚拟的，为什么普通人不能当英雄？如果以发行NFT的形式，构建一座有超级英雄的城市，里面可以竞选市长，有银行，有金融投资部门，有超级英雄俱乐部，还有娱乐的地方，用NFT销售赚来的钱，拿出一部分救助现实生活中需要被帮助的人，并且以超级英雄的名义给予救助，成立一个艺术基金会，帮助艺术家发行NFT, 做实体世界的品牌联名，开线下的2077朋克猫之城的咖啡厅，俱乐部，把朋克猫做成一个虚拟偶像，拍它拯救人类的视频，做朋克猫相关的动画，游戏，电影，那该有多好？我虚构了在2077这个年份，一个非常赛博朋克的年份，一座充满爱的，有超级英雄的虚拟城市的概念就这么诞生了。\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/b231acd8dc1e84ed.jpg)\n\n我找来了我的妹妹，我们一起设计了创世英雄，我们用斯芬克斯猫做了原型，就觉得它长得挺酷的，第一个诞生的英雄就是Joker。当时我妹妹把Joker猫画出来的时候，我惊叹，这就是我想要的。我觉得小丑就像这座城市的精神，他要颠覆腐败的现实世界，在Web3 创造一个自由的国度，一座爱与英雄的国度。他是自由与反叛的代表，他很平凡，就像我们每个人，但是他又很善良，偶尔有点癫狂，又有着病态的浪漫爱情观。我很喜欢我们创造的这个人物，在2077朋克猫之城的世界里，Joker是我们城市的精神象征。现实生活中我是一个看起来挺柔弱的女生，但是在Web3，我可以扮演任何人，我可以做一个具有反叛精神的冒险家，我可以创建我的帝国，甚至我可以是男性。每一个来Web3的人在这里都可以拥有一个新的身份，新的ID，这不应该是社区，我觉得应该是一座城市。我们有相同的价值观，相同的气质，然后我们聚集在这里，成为在Web3一座新城市的居民。\n\n回想起我上小学的时候，老师问我，你长大以后的梦想是什么？我给老师的回答是“当市长”。现在想想，觉得有点可爱，有点天真还有点好笑，不知道是不是因为这个原因，我想做一座虚拟的城市，我们因为相似而聚集在一起，不再有地域的划分，不再被动的困在一座城市，而是以相似的精神和价值观令我们聚集在这个城市。它应该是无国度的，国际性的，我的理想中，这个城市有来自世界各地的人民，我希望这座城市成为我们的精神乐园，就像头号玩家一样。\n\n### 一名我梦寐以求的合伙人\n\n![新找的合伙人品味绝佳，我们经常打3小时以上的电话进行探讨](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/42b89a23d5451cf0.jpg)\n\n一切进展的很慢，除了意见总是和我不合的妹妹，我对代码，合约技术，和怎么设计一个NFT产品项目一窍不通。在近一个月的时间里，我开始疯狂的学习，加各种各样的区块链群，关注NFT公众号，也就在那个时候，法哥社区的投研报告真的帮助了我不少，那个时候还没有专业的NFT项目中文投研分析，是@NFT_Aerfa专业的投研报告，帮助我这个小菜鸟能够快速成长。整个3月份我都孤军奋战，埋头苦学，一切对我来说都太难了，我没有团队，也不懂技术，甚至连图片生成都不会。\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/057804e1900ee436.jpg)\n\n在3月25日，我终于迎来了我的第一位救兵，我们打了262分钟的电话。他在我的微信朋友圈寻找合作伙伴的时候联系了我，他是一个我平时不怎么联系的网友，经沟通得知，他不但懂营销，设计超棒拿过奖，而且英文非常好（加拿大华裔）我们的理念非常合，他可真是完美的partner！我们都有很庞大的计划，我们想构建一个这样的NFT系列，我们想像无聊猿一样，想做一个知名的卡通IP品牌，想链接现实世界，想做艺术基金会，想做Dao, 想做赛博朋克风的虚拟像素城市。\n\n## 月猴的故事\n\n我和他都非常喜欢这个2077朋克猫之城的概念，我们视如珍宝，又花了一个月时间完善产品，但还是很怕出错。我们改了无数版的roadmap,但是每次写完，发现市场已经把你写的玩过了，我们又只能不断修改新的版本。当时月鸟很火，我们就说，要不我们先做一个试水项目吧？先积累点经验，毕竟如果是第一次就做一个那么庞大的项目，又没有经验，会很容易失败的。于是我们画了第一版的月猴，有点可爱，我很喜欢，但是让大家更喜欢现在的版本。\n\n我们本来找了一个画插画的女生，但是她才画了20%就不画了，可是我也没有画过这种像素风的NFT，我只能边学边画，亲自画完了剩下的所有部件。每一个像素点我都画的非常认真，所幸大家都觉得我们的艺术不错。我还擅自画了一个无脸男的1-1版本，纯个人喜好，我很喜欢宫崎骏电影《千与千寻》中无脸男这个角色。可惜没机会放进去。只能在这里放出来给大家看看了。\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/27fa93b160c403ad.jpg)\n\n我们还在月猴头上加了一把钥匙🔑，这是一个彩蛋。我们希望有一天能用月猴这把钥匙，打开2077朋克猫之城的钥匙。我们还在官网加了一首彩蛋音乐，是我挑的，音乐是《飞屋环游记》的一首插曲，为什么用这首歌曲，我真的很爱旅行，我希望这一生能去很多国家看不同的风景，完成环游世界的梦想。第二点是这首歌真的很好听，每次听都会让我心情愉悦，我希望能和大家分享这种愉快的心情和冒险精神。我曾看到推特上有人评论说这是他听过最棒的铸造音乐，这真的很鼓舞我，有玩家能懂我的这些小小心思。被陌生人认可的感觉真的很棒。\n\n**合伙人的的中途离开**\n\n在我们的月猴项目进度到80%的时候，他失踪了，微信发了几十条，石沉大海，电话也无人接听。这对于我来说是致命的打击。团队缺一个人，就很多地方都进行不下去了。我很伤心也很无助，沉沦了好几天，还躲在被窝里偷偷哭了一次。可我不想让团队其他成员受到我的情绪影响，如果连我都崩溃了，那其他人该怎么办呢。此时团队里还有另外两位技术成员，一位是负责写智能合约的，一位是负责做网站前端后端的。他们都来自互联网大厂程序员，是我用一通1小时的电话谈下来的。这两位合伙人其实我们彼此都没有见过，我们都非常陌生，不知道网络对面到底是一个怎么样的人，他们仅仅通过一通电话就加入了我的团队。他们如此信任我，我暗自下定决心，一定要对得起他们对我的信任，我一定要让团队里的每一个人都获得回报。\n\n**意料不到的火爆售罄**\n\n由于我最重要的合伙人突然的不辞而别，我一人承担起了做活动策划，写营销文案，做社群引流，负责写多个社交账号，谈商务合作，社群的搭建和管理。我一个人忙的团团转，我在为了一个未知的结果付出了100%的努力。既然做了，我就想做好它。2022年6月28日我们开始正式宣传，我策划了一个帮月猴找香蕉拿免费白单的活动，搜话题#whotookmybananas 还能看到很多人参与了这个有趣的活动。这个活动是我想出来的，仅用了一天时间推特账号就涨了1500个粉丝。3天后，也就是2022年7月1日，我们的项目正式发售。总数是8888张，前1500张是freemint，剩余是0.008e一张，销售速度之快令我意外，在忐忑和惊喜之中，只用了34分钟就售罄了。而在此之前，我根本本没想到会卖完，包括团队里的其他成员也没想到。我们居然做到了！\n\n### 多次的崩溃和哭泣，\n\n**从决定做这个项目开始，我一共哭了4次。**\n\n第1次是团队重要成员的离开，我们一起策划了2077朋克猫之城，通过上百小时的语音，开过无数的讨论会，一起创造了月猴，包括网站也是他设计的，我们沟通了3个月，他却没有任何招呼，不辞而别，当时NFT市场一滩死水，我感到很绝望，想到这几个月的努力全部白费了，而且一想到辜负了其他团队成员对我的信任，我很难过，哭的很伤心。 \n  \n 第2次是在我们项目发售的前一天，负责写合约的技术成员，犯了失误，提前泄露了我们上传在IPFS上的头像，被别有用心的人盗取了所有8888张头像，并在我们公售前就发布了假的和我们一模一样的collection，甚至取了一样的名字，连网站也是原封不动的复制了。我又气又急，我被气哭了。 \n  \n 第3次是推特运营犯了一个非常低级的错误，导致我们的项目遭受到很多负面的言论，一时半会找不到人顶替他，我无助到了顶点，所有人都在期待着我们官方有什么大动作，而实际情况的是那天并没有推特运营的人。这个时候A出现了，他接下了推特，什么回报都没和我谈，他说他也是有冒险精神的人，所以他喜欢我们这个项目，会陪我走到最后。他是第一个站出来坚定支持月猴的人，我哭了，因为感动。 \n  \n 第4次是因为 X，那个我的web3引路人。我看到他买了非常多的，月猴的竞品Nft，我很生气，把他买的月猴全部要了回来。也许我这么做，显得很不理性，因为X，我才会去学习这些对我来说陌生而又的知识，独自探索，一点点进入加密圈，设计了2077朋克猫之城，发售了月猴。他对我来说是很重要的人，但是他却为我的竞争对手站台……他似乎完全不顾及我的感受，每天都能在推特Space，还有推特上看到他身体力行的带货着我的竞品Nft。积累了半年的情绪一下就爆发了，我感到很委屈，对他很失望，我觉得我这半年来的努力不知道是为了什么。\n\n**我不知道大家有没有体会过那种孤立无援的感觉，一个人应对所有责骂和压力的时刻**\n\n团队其他人都是匿名，在卖完那一刻他们就已经退出了。从月猴卖完的那一刻，其实就只剩我一人了。除了几个临时帮忙管理微信群的志愿者，原来的团队走的只剩我一个人。在开售前我创建了4，5个微信群，一共近千人，大家从mint完的那一刻就开始疯狂@我，让我赶紧拉盘，做燃烧，合成，完成发币那种一整套。但是我们根本就没有准备这些，我们本来就是一个没有线路图的CC0项目，我不知道大家为什么每天要我做合成燃烧？\n\n**缺乏经验带来的后果**\n\n我甚至连什么是做市商都不知道，第一天甚至闹出一个非常无奈的笑话，因为海外营销合伙人的离开，推特我临时找了一个web2的朋友，他从美国留学回来，英文挺不错的。但是由于他不懂任何区块链知识，当他漏登记了一个KOL的白名单，那个时候我们已经卖完了，KOL让他空投作为补偿，他回答对方“什么是空投？我们技术不懂空投。”这段对话被KOL以嘲讽戏虐的口气截图发在了推特上，很快就在圈子里传播开来了，造成了很多负面的评论。我不得不让他离开了团队，于是官方推特就突然没人运营了，那天是卖完的第一天，很多人看我们官推没有怎么更新，以为我们要跑路了，纷纷以低于公售价很多的价格砸地板。这个时候我还连怎么批量扫地板都不会，因为我根本没想到会卖完，我也不知道原来做NFT项目是一定要配合做市商的。团队负责做网站的小伙伴可能看我这样于心不忍吧，他虽然已经拿到了钱，但没有完全离开，他人很好，还教了我怎么用Gem批量扫地板。那天是发售完的第二天，我学会了用Gem批量扫地板，0.008的公售价，地板被人砸到了0.003，我用了2个以太慢慢的把地板扫到了0.007，0.008，很快又被人砸下来了。直到第五天，地板直接被砸到0.0018左右（以当时币价大概才1U多），我很费解，GAS费都要这个价格了吧，为什么你们就不能钻石手，再等等呢？\n\n### 每天都有负面指责，但是你的身边却已经没有人了\n\n地板跌了那么多，我一边要在群里安抚大家，一边要找为团队找新的成员，一边要扫地板，一边还要策划后续的官方活动，一边想对策。我累垮了，每天我只能睡3个多小时，饭也只来得及吃一顿，不到一周时间，我就瘦了5斤。压力大到我根本无法入睡，但是我真的很想把月猴做好，把精力专注于继续做事上，我只能解散了每天几百上千条的微信群，社区的志愿者帮忙建了DC（我们没有官方DC , 目前他不回信息，不知道他什么意思，也许以后要重新创建了）后面我又用了2个以太陆陆续续把一些割肉纸手的筹码分批回收了，因为我知道，我还会继续做事的，便宜收回的筹码我可以送给那些真正喜欢月猴的人。\n\n### 看，我们为此做出的努力\n\n* 7月1日公售34分钟售罄\n* 7月2日创建了非官方DC\n* 7月3日 举办了第一期的寻找聪明猴子的解密\n* 7月3日 举办了猴叫 的推特space \n* 7月6日 举办了寻找小金猴的解密游戏\n* 7月8日 举办了挂单0.02，官方随机扫的活动\n* 7月12日 举办了秀出你的冒险家精神的活动\n* 7月13日 提出了招十位大使，探索cc0社区治理的方案\n* 7月13日-7月18日 积极参加推特space,寻找大使和社区经理中\n* 7月19日 讲诉月猴的故事 《月猴的前世今生：种子，英雄，冒险精神》\n\n无论再多的负面言论，压力，哪怕原团队只剩我一个人了，中途我也多次经历崩溃想放弃，但是还是咬牙在坚持，我们没有停止过尝试和努力。\n\n**以上，就是月猴的故事。**\n\n**没有什么牛逼的项目方，只有一个对Web3带着憧憬和梦想的女生，却经历无数挫折，困难，压力，期待奇迹，还在努力坚持的故事。**\n\n## \n一封诚挚的邀请信\n\n有人问我，为什么不Rug , 我的回答是：一开始我可能是为了一个男生进入了这个圈子，并且开始做NFT的项目，但是这趟加密旅途中，我遇到了一些真心帮助我的小伙伴，结交了一些友善又有爱心的朋友，包括那些信任我的初始的团队成员 ，我们素未谋面却相信我的能力，加入了这个团队。还有1760holders(不包含纸手），还有目前DC里的那495位月猴家人，还有现在正在帮我那些人，我觉得我要为他们负责。但我深知，没有团队，一个CC0项目，最重要的是社区，没有社区这个项目很快就会被大家渐渐忘记而逐渐死去，就像那100个NFT项目里面死掉的99个一样。\n\n所以，接下来，诚邀10位具有冒险精神的大使，参与一个伟大的冒险旅程。\n\n让我们来做一场社区实验：除了欧美项目mfer，韩国项目MimicShhans，我们中国 为什么不能拥有一个有自己的社区文化精神CC0项目呢？\n\n《Web3小图狗是否能通过社区共识成长为小蓝筹的实验？》\n\n如果你看了我的故事，和我一样具有冒险精神，你觉得你也是这样的人。\n\n如果你觉得我们志同道合，愿意一起探索社区运营，一起造梦。\n\n也许努力过后，你最后只得到一堆不值钱的小图片，你也不会后悔。\n\n如果你还有兴趣，请往下看。\n\n我将把月猴彻底去中心化，关于月猴未来的发展，所有决定以社区投票来进行。以“Dao”的形式运作，80%的交易版税给予社区，其中65%给多签钱包，给十位大使和开发团队，15%用于社区继续运作，比如生产周边，资助月猴家人举办线下活动等。所有重大决定，由社区投票决定月猴未来的走向。我作为月猴的创作者，会以社区贡献者之一的身份继续参与这场社区实验。其实这么做的国内项目方，愿意把交易版税大部分给社区的应该只有我一个，并把权力交还社区，实行真正的去中心精神，给一些有才能的人一个已经搭建好的舞台。\n\n### 十位月猴大使是怎么规划的？\n\n* CCO   名额6位，宣扬社区文化，喜欢开推特space聊天，有自己的观点喜欢当发言人，也能主持space,推特已经有一些粉丝，认识一些加密圈大佬，能创建微信群并带大家一起活跃起来。期待有2位老外或者华裔加入。\n* 社区经理   名额1位，管理MOD，商务洽谈，定期举办社区活动（每周至少1次），海外用户的维护，英语流利，能独立参加AMA解答问题。\n* 推特运营   名额1位，运营官方推特账号，和活动策划一起举办官方活动。\n* 活动策划   名额1位，负责官方活动的文案和落地执行\n* 商务经理   名额1位，负责帮我们月猴的家人谋求福利啦\n\n**关于大使的回报，你能得到什么？**\n\n一次真正能实操参与web3项目的经验，一场充满冒险的社会实验，一次展示你能力的机会，你的履历会更丰富，你会获得很多成长，你会认识很多人脉，一群和你一样爱冒险的冒险家\n\n5%的永久版税收入+50张月猴NFT\n\n**另外月猴可能会增加新玩法，需要3位开发团队**\n\n合约工程师（写过智能合约，技术高超，懂多签钱包）\n\n前端+后端（会做适用于web3的网站）\n\n美术（月猴新头像，表情包，活动宣传图，网页UI）\n\n5%的永久版税收入+0.5eth（或者50只月猴NFT)\n\n## 如何报名\n\n①我们会在月猴的Discord开设一个报名大使的频道，大家去频道里报名写下你的履历经历和联系方式，符合要求的我们会主动联系你！[DC链接直达](https://discord.gg/AsEFq45HrU)\n\n②直接推特联系我，发你的CV！[@PKCC001](https://twitter.com/PKCC001)\n\n**新增的赋能** \n\n如果你想做NFT-头像类项目，或者想从我这里学点什么。 假设你买了10张月猴Nft，可以推特私聊我，预约1次和我通话的机会，时长是10分钟。 买了30只月猴Nft，那就是30分钟的时长。 在这里，我个人推出这项服务，是为了感谢那些一直支持月猴的大户和钻石手们。\n\n**关于月猴未来的探索**\n\n未来会走向哪里，我也不知道，看社区的小伙伴愿意带着月猴走多远吧，如果可以的话，我们想做新玩法，甚至带月猴进元宇宙。噢！还有头上那把该死的钥匙，我希望能启动它，让它能打开2077朋克猫之城的门！\n\n### 最后写给Web3的新人\n\n\n像我这样没资源，没人脉，也不懂区块链知识的普通人，都可以通过不到半年的自学，从零学习如何做一个NFT项目，达成八千多张NFT全部卖完的小小成就。对于半年前的连推特都不会用的我来说，想都没想过能够走到今天这一步。\n\n在这个加密世界，真的可以创造奇迹，只要你拥有好奇心，对于新知识的有强烈渴望和探索，敢于冒险，即使遇到挫折，困难也不放弃。建议大家多学习web3需要用到的技术，比如学习用Solidtiy语言写合约 , 适用于区块链的网站前端后端，画PFP的配件（像素风，3D ,插画风），推特运营，社区管理，也许你只用了一周的时间，就能赚好几个月的工资。但是实践经验也很重要，团队一般不会用没有经验的人，风险太高了，所以有机会就一定要多参与Web3的项目累积经验，哪怕初期没有回报，实操的经验是无价的。\n\n比如，我们团队里写智能合约的小伙伴是匿名的，通过这次写合约收入约为12eth，按今天以太1500u的价格，约为18000usdt。大家也知道以太坊的价格过两年会涨，等两年就60000usdt了，这可能是很多人在Web2里一年的工资收入。所以这就是web3令人惊喜的地方，选对人，选对团队，你所学的web3技能一定能给你带来意想不到的回报。遇到合适的机会就紧紧抓住吧，时间会给你回报的。\n\n**月猴欢迎每一位冒险家的加入！**\n\n在此特别感谢帮助过我的朋友们

X先生是谁，他是一位加密圈的OG，应该不想被知道是谁吧，所以就z暂叫他X吧。\n\n### 埋下的一颗种子\n\n我一直迟迟没有行动，因为我觉得这个世界对于我来说太陌生了，我和crypto唯一的接触仅限于2019年用火币买过一些币，还是用人民币买的，那时的我连小狐狸钱包是什么都不知道。从来没有用过twitter，也没有用过opensea ,更不知道什么是discord。何况我的英文也不好，加密世界对我来说遥不可及，我觉得发NFT对我来说，简直难于登天。 某一天，朋友在微信朋友圈分享了一个twitter space的链接，我好奇点了进去，大家在聊什么链，什么二层协议，我什么都没听懂，然后退了出来。也就是那天，我注册了推特，正式进入了web3，那天是2021年12月30日。\n\n我打了退堂鼓，我发现twitter上人人都英文很流利，聊着我听不懂的话题和技术术语，直到2月10日那天，我看到史中老师发布在公众号的一篇文章“NFT精神史：罐头，青蛙，和平凡人的15分钟英雄梦想”，我觉得这篇文章太浪漫了，深深的打动了我，你们可能不会理解，我看这篇文章看哭了。对于我这种又浪漫又理想主义的人来说，NFT也许真的是每一个平凡人的机会？如果我能通过Nft来拯救他人呢？\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/70f50f9ef3898ec3.jpg)\n\n## 一个爱与英雄的虚拟城市-2077朋克猫之城\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/3b3a8d404867dde2.jpg)\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/182929274877b612.jpg)\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/85fe97c72005989b.jpg)\n\n我想，为什么我不能在Web3里构建一座虚拟的城市呢？让平凡的普通人也有机会当英雄，看了那么多漫威，DC的电影，里面构建了那么多英雄人物却是虚拟的，为什么普通人不能当英雄？如果以发行NFT的形式，构建一座有超级英雄的城市，里面可以竞选市长，有银行，有金融投资部门，有超级英雄俱乐部，还有娱乐的地方，用NFT销售赚来的钱，拿出一部分救助现实生活中需要被帮助的人，并且以超级英雄的名义给予救助，成立一个艺术基金会，帮助艺术家发行NFT, 做实体世界的品牌联名，开线下的2077朋克猫之城的咖啡厅，俱乐部，把朋克猫做成一个虚拟偶像，拍它拯救人类的视频，做朋克猫相关的动画，游戏，电影，那该有多好？我虚构了在2077这个年份，一个非常赛博朋克的年份，一座充满爱的，有超级英雄的虚拟城市的概念就这么诞生了。\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/b231acd8dc1e84ed.jpg)\n\n我找来了我的妹妹，我们一起设计了创世英雄，我们用斯芬克斯猫做了原型，就觉得它长得挺酷的，第一个诞生的英雄就是Joker。当时我妹妹把Joker猫画出来的时候，我惊叹，这就是我想要的。我觉得小丑就像这座城市的精神，他要颠覆腐败的现实世界，在Web3 创造一个自由的国度，一座爱与英雄的国度。他是自由与反叛的代表，他很平凡，就像我们每个人，但是他又很善良，偶尔有点癫狂，又有着病态的浪漫爱情观。我很喜欢我们创造的这个人物，在2077朋克猫之城的世界里，Joker是我们城市的精神象征。现实生活中我是一个看起来挺柔弱的女生，但是在Web3，我可以扮演任何人，我可以做一个具有反叛精神的冒险家，我可以创建我的帝国，甚至我可以是男性。每一个来Web3的人在这里都可以拥有一个新的身份，新的ID，这不应该是社区，我觉得应该是一座城市。我们有相同的价值观，相同的气质，然后我们聚集在这里，成为在Web3一座新城市的居民。\n\n回想起我上小学的时候，老师问我，你长大以后的梦想是什么？我给老师的回答是“当市长”。现在想想，觉得有点可爱，有点天真还有点好笑，不知道是不是因为这个原因，我想做一座虚拟的城市，我们因为相似而聚集在一起，不再有地域的划分，不再被动的困在一座城市，而是以相似的精神和价值观令我们聚集在这个城市。它应该是无国度的，国际性的，我的理想中，这个城市有来自世界各地的人民，我希望这座城市成为我们的精神乐园，就像头号玩家一样。\n\n### 一名我梦寐以求的合伙人\n\n![新找的合伙人品味绝佳，我们经常打3小时以上的电话进行探讨](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/42b89a23d5451cf0.jpg)\n\n一切进展的很慢，除了意见总是和我不合的妹妹，我对代码，合约技术，和怎么设计一个NFT产品项目一窍不通。在近一个月的时间里，我开始疯狂的学习，加各种各样的区块链群，关注NFT公众号，也就在那个时候，法哥社区的投研报告真的帮助了我不少，那个时候还没有专业的NFT项目中文投研分析，是@NFT_Aerfa专业的投研报告，帮助我这个小菜鸟能够快速成长。整个3月份我都孤军奋战，埋头苦学，一切对我来说都太难了，我没有团队，也不懂技术，甚至连图片生成都不会。\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/057804e1900ee436.jpg)\n\n在3月25日，我终于迎来了我的第一位救兵，我们打了262分钟的电话。他在我的微信朋友圈寻找合作伙伴的时候联系了我，他是一个我平时不怎么联系的网友，经沟通得知，他不但懂营销，设计超棒拿过奖，而且英文非常好（加拿大华裔）我们的理念非常合，他可真是完美的partner！我们都有很庞大的计划，我们想构建一个这样的NFT系列，我们想像无聊猿一样，想做一个知名的卡通IP品牌，想链接现实世界，想做艺术基金会，想做Dao, 想做赛博朋克风的虚拟像素城市。\n\n## 月猴的故事\n\n我和他都非常喜欢这个2077朋克猫之城的概念，我们视如珍宝，又花了一个月时间完善产品，但还是很怕出错。我们改了无数版的roadmap,但是每次写完，发现市场已经把你写的玩过了，我们又只能不断修改新的版本。当时月鸟很火，我们就说，要不我们先做一个试水项目吧？先积累点经验，毕竟如果是第一次就做一个那么庞大的项目，又没有经验，会很容易失败的。于是我们画了第一版的月猴，有点可爱，我很喜欢，但是让大家更喜欢现在的版本。\n\n我们本来找了一个画插画的女生，但是她才画了20%就不画了，可是我也没有画过这种像素风的NFT，我只能边学边画，亲自画完了剩下的所有部件。每一个像素点我都画的非常认真，所幸大家都觉得我们的艺术不错。我还擅自画了一个无脸男的1-1版本，纯个人喜好，我很喜欢宫崎骏电影《千与千寻》中无脸男这个角色。可惜没机会放进去。只能在这里放出来给大家看看了。\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/27fa93b160c403ad.jpg)\n\n我们还在月猴头上加了一把钥匙🔑，这是一个彩蛋。我们希望有一天能用月猴这把钥匙，打开2077朋克猫之城的钥匙。我们还在官网加了一首彩蛋音乐，是我挑的，音乐是《飞屋环游记》的一首插曲，为什么用这首歌曲，我真的很爱旅行，我希望这一生能去很多国家看不同的风景，完成环游世界的梦想。第二点是这首歌真的很好听，每次听都会让我心情愉悦，我希望能和大家分享这种愉快的心情和冒险精神。我曾看到推特上有人评论说这是他听过最棒的铸造音乐，这真的很鼓舞我，有玩家能懂我的这些小小心思。被陌生人认可的感觉真的很棒。\n\n**合伙人的的中途离开**\n\n在我们的月猴项目进度到80%的时候，他失踪了，微信发了几十条，石沉大海，电话也无人接听。这对于我来说是致命的打击。团队缺一个人，就很多地方都进行不下去了。我很伤心也很无助，沉沦了好几天，还躲在被窝里偷偷哭了一次。可我不想让团队其他成员受到我的情绪影响，如果连我都崩溃了，那其他人该怎么办呢。此时团队里还有另外两位技术成员，一位是负责写智能合约的，一位是负责做网站前端后端的。他们都来自互联网大厂程序员，是我用一通1小时的电话谈下来的。这两位合伙人其实我们彼此都没有见过，我们都非常陌生，不知道网络对面到底是一个怎么样的人，他们仅仅通过一通电话就加入了我的团队。他们如此信任我，我暗自下定决心，一定要对得起他们对我的信任，我一定要让团队里的每一个人都获得回报。\n\n**意料不到的火爆售罄**\n\n由于我最重要的合伙人突然的不辞而别，我一人承担起了做活动策划，写营销文案，做社群引流，负责写多个社交账号，谈商务合作，社群的搭建和管理。我一个人忙的团团转，我在为了一个未知的结果付出了100%的努力。既然做了，我就想做好它。2022年6月28日我们开始正式宣传，我策划了一个帮月猴找香蕉拿免费白单的活动，搜话题#whotookmybananas 还能看到很多人参与了这个有趣的活动。这个活动是我想出来的，仅用了一天时间推特账号就涨了1500个粉丝。3天后，也就是2022年7月1日，我们的项目正式发售。总数是8888张，前1500张是freemint，剩余是0.008e一张，销售速度之快令我意外，在忐忑和惊喜之中，只用了34分钟就售罄了。而在此之前，我根本本没想到会卖完，包括团队里的其他成员也没想到。我们居然做到了！\n\n### 多次的崩溃和哭泣，\n\n**从决定做这个项目开始，我一共哭了4次。**\n\n第1次是团队重要成员的离开，我们一起策划了2077朋克猫之城，通过上百小时的语音，开过无数的讨论会，一起创造了月猴，包括网站也是他设计的，我们沟通了3个月，他却没有任何招呼，不辞而别，当时NFT市场一滩死水，我感到很绝望，想到这几个月的努力全部白费了，而且一想到辜负了其他团队成员对我的信任，我很难过，哭的很伤心。 \n  \n 第2次是在我们项目发售的前一天，负责写合约的技术成员，犯了失误，提前泄露了我们上传在IPFS上的头像，被别有用心的人盗取了所有8888张头像，并在我们公售前就发布了假的和我们一模一样的collection，甚至取了一样的名字，连网站也是原封不动的复制了。我又气又急，我被气哭了。 \n  \n 第3次是推特运营犯了一个非常低级的错误，导致我们的项目遭受到很多负面的言论，一时半会找不到人顶替他，我无助到了顶点，所有人都在期待着我们官方有什么大动作，而实际情况的是那天并没有推特运营的人。这个时候A出现了，他接下了推特，什么回报都没和我谈，他说他也是有冒险精神的人，所以他喜欢我们这个项目，会陪我走到最后。他是第一个站出来坚定支持月猴的人，我哭了，因为感动。 \n  \n 第4次是因为 X，那个我的web3引路人。我看到他买了非常多的，月猴的竞品Nft，我很生气，把他买的月猴全部要了回来。也许我这么做，显得很不理性，因为X，我才会去学习这些对我来说陌生而又的知识，独自探索，一点点进入加密圈，设计了2077朋克猫之城，发售了月猴。他对我来说是很重要的人，但是他却为我的竞争对手站台……他似乎完全不顾及我的感受，每天都能在推特Space，还有推特上看到他身体力行的带货着我的竞品Nft。积累了半年的情绪一下就爆发了，我感到很委屈，对他很失望，我觉得我这半年来的努力不知道是为了什么。\n\n**我不知道大家有没有体会过那种孤立无援的感觉，一个人应对所有责骂和压力的时刻**\n\n团队其他人都是匿名，在卖完那一刻他们就已经退出了。从月猴卖完的那一刻，其实就只剩我一人了。除了几个临时帮忙管理微信群的志愿者，原来的团队走的只剩我一个人。在开售前我创建了4，5个微信群，一共近千人，大家从mint完的那一刻就开始疯狂@我，让我赶紧拉盘，做燃烧，合成，完成发币那种一整套。但是我们根本就没有准备这些，我们本来就是一个没有线路图的CC0项目，我不知道大家为什么每天要我做合成燃烧？\n\n**缺乏经验带来的后果**\n\n我甚至连什么是做市商都不知道，第一天甚至闹出一个非常无奈的笑话，因为海外营销合伙人的离开，推特我临时找了一个web2的朋友，他从美国留学回来，英文挺不错的。但是由于他不懂任何区块链知识，当他漏登记了一个KOL的白名单，那个时候我们已经卖完了，KOL让他空投作为补偿，他回答对方“什么是空投？我们技术不懂空投。”这段对话被KOL以嘲讽戏虐的口气截图发在了推特上，很快就在圈子里传播开来了，造成了很多负面的评论。我不得不让他离开了团队，于是官方推特就突然没人运营了，那天是卖完的第一天，很多人看我们官推没有怎么更新，以为我们要跑路了，纷纷以低于公售价很多的价格砸地板。这个时候我还连怎么批量扫地板都不会，因为我根本没想到会卖完，我也不知道原来做NFT项目是一定要配合做市商的。团队负责做网站的小伙伴可能看我这样于心不忍吧，他虽然已经拿到了钱，但没有完全离开，他人很好，还教了我怎么用Gem批量扫地板。那天是发售完的第二天，我学会了用Gem批量扫地板，0.008的公售价，地板被人砸到了0.003，我用了2个以太慢慢的把地板扫到了0.007，0.008，很快又被人砸下来了。直到第五天，地板直接被砸到0.0018左右（以当时币价大概才1U多），我很费解，GAS费都要这个价格了吧，为什么你们就不能钻石手，再等等呢？\n\n### 每天都有负面指责，但是你的身边却已经没有人了\n\n地板跌了那么多，我一边要在群里安抚大家，一边要找为团队找新的成员，一边要扫地板，一边还要策划后续的官方活动，一边想对策。我累垮了，每天我只能睡3个多小时，饭也只来得及吃一顿，不到一周时间，我就瘦了5斤。压力大到我根本无法入睡，但是我真的很想把月猴做好，把精力专注于继续做事上，我只能解散了每天几百上千条的微信群，社区的志愿者帮忙建了DC（我们没有官方DC , 目前他不回信息，不知道他什么意思，也许以后要重新创建了）后面我又用了2个以太陆陆续续把一些割肉纸手的筹码分批回收了，因为我知道，我还会继续做事的，便宜收回的筹码我可以送给那些真正喜欢月猴的人。\n\n### 看，我们为此做出的努力\n\n* 7月1日公售34分钟售罄\n* 7月2日创建了非官方DC\n* 7月3日 举办了第一期的寻找聪明猴子的解密\n* 7月3日 举办了猴叫 的推特space \n* 7月6日 举办了寻找小金猴的解密游戏\n* 7月8日 举办了挂单0.02，官方随机扫的活动\n* 7月12日 举办了秀出你的冒险家精神的活动\n* 7月13日 提出了招十位大使，探索cc0社区治理的方案\n* 7月13日-7月18日 积极参加推特space,寻找大使和社区经理中\n* 7月19日 讲诉月猴的故事 《月猴的前世今生：种子，英雄，冒险精神》\n\n无论再多的负面言论，压力，哪怕原团队只剩我一个人了，中途我也多次经历崩溃想放弃，但是还是咬牙在坚持，我们没有停止过尝试和努力。\n\n**以上，就是月猴的故事。**\n\n**没有什么牛逼的项目方，只有一个对Web3带着憧憬和梦想的女生，却经历无数挫折，困难，压力，期待奇迹，还在努力坚持的故事。**\n\n## \n一封诚挚的邀请信\n\n有人问我，为什么不Rug , 我的回答是：一开始我可能是为了一个男生进入了这个圈子，并且开始做NFT的项目，但是这趟加密旅途中，我遇到了一些真心帮助我的小伙伴，结交了一些友善又有爱心的朋友，包括那些信任我的初始的团队成员 ，我们素未谋面却相信我的能力，加入了这个团队。还有1760holders(不包含纸手），还有目前DC里的那495位月猴家人，还有现在正在帮我那些人，我觉得我要为他们负责。但我深知，没有团队，一个CC0项目，最重要的是社区，没有社区这个项目很快就会被大家渐渐忘记而逐渐死去，就像那100个NFT项目里面死掉的99个一样。\n\n所以，接下来，诚邀10位具有冒险精神的大使，参与一个伟大的冒险旅程。\n\n让我们来做一场社区实验：除了欧美项目mfer，韩国项目MimicShhans，我们中国 为什么不能拥有一个有自己的社区文化精神CC0项目呢？\n\n《Web3小图狗是否能通过社区共识成长为小蓝筹的实验？》\n\n如果你看了我的故事，和我一样具有冒险精神，你觉得你也是这样的人。\n\n如果你觉得我们志同道合，愿意一起探索社区运营，一起造梦。\n\n也许努力过后，你最后只得到一堆不值钱的小图片，你也不会后悔。\n\n如果你还有兴趣，请往下看。\n\n我将把月猴彻底去中心化，关于月猴未来的发展，所有决定以社区投票来进行。以“Dao”的形式运作，80%的交易版税给予社区，其中65%给多签钱包，给十位大使和开发团队，15%用于社区继续运作，比如生产周边，资助月猴家人举办线下活动等。所有重大决定，由社区投票决定月猴未来的走向。我作为月猴的创作者，会以社区贡献者之一的身份继续参与这场社区实验。其实这么做的国内项目方，愿意把交易版税大部分给社区的应该只有我一个，并把权力交还社区，实行真正的去中心精神，给一些有才能的人一个已经搭建好的舞台。\n\n### 十位月猴大使是怎么规划的？\n\n* CCO   名额6位，宣扬社区文化，喜欢开推特space聊天，有自己的观点喜欢当发言人，也能主持space,推特已经有一些粉丝，认识一些加密圈大佬，能创建微信群并带大家一起活跃起来。期待有2位老外或者华裔加入。\n* 社区经理   名额1位，管理MOD，商务洽谈，定期举办社区活动（每周至少1次），海外用户的维护，英语流利，能独立参加AMA解答问题。\n* 推特运营   名额1位，运营官方推特账号，和活动策划一起举办官方活动。\n* 活动策划   名额1位，负责官方活动的文案和落地执行\n* 商务经理   名额1位，负责帮我们月猴的家人谋求福利啦\n\n**关于大使的回报，你能得到什么？**\n\n一次真正能实操参与web3项目的经验，一场充满冒险的社会实验，一次展示你能力的机会，你的履历会更丰富，你会获得很多成长，你会认识很多人脉，一群和你一样爱冒险的冒险家\n\n5%的永久版税收入+50张月猴NFT\n\n**另外月猴可能会增加新玩法，需要3位开发团队**\n\n合约工程师（写过智能合约，技术高超，懂多签钱包）\n\n前端+后端（会做适用于web3的网站）\n\n美术（月猴新头像，表情包，活动宣传图，网页UI）\n\n5%的永久版税收入+0.5eth（或者50只月猴NFT)\n\n## 如何报名\n\n①我们会在月猴的Discord开设一个报名大使的频道，大家去频道里报名写下你的履历经历和联系方式，符合要求的我们会主动联系你！[DC链接直达](https://discord.gg/AsEFq45HrU)\n\n②直接推特联系我，发你的CV！[@PKCC001](https://twitter.com/PKCC001)\n\n**新增的赋能** \n\n如果你想做NFT-头像类项目，或者想从我这里学点什么。 假设你买了10张月猴Nft，可以推特私聊我，预约1次和我通话的机会，时长是10分钟。 买了30只月猴Nft，那就是30分钟的时长。 在这里，我个人推出这项服务，是为了感谢那些一直支持月猴的大户和钻石手们。\n\n**关于月猴未来的探索**\n\n未来会走向哪里，我也不知道，看社区的小伙伴愿意带着月猴走多远吧，如果可以的话，我们想做新玩法，甚至带月猴进元宇宙。噢！还有头上那把该死的钥匙，我希望能启动它，让它能打开2077朋克猫之城的门！\n\n###

,更不知道什么是discord。何况我的英文也不好，加密世界对我来说遥不可及，我觉得发NFT对我来说，简直难于登天。 某一天，朋友在微信朋友圈分享了一个twitter space的链接，我好奇点了进去，大家在聊什么链，什么二层协议，我什么都没听懂，然后退了出来。也就是那天，我注册了推特，正式进入了web3，那天是2021年12月30日。\n\n我打了退堂鼓，我发现twitter上人人都英文很流利，聊着我听不懂的话题和技术术语，直到2月10日那天，我看到史中老师发布在公众号的一篇文章“NFT精神史：罐头，青蛙，和平凡人的15分钟英雄梦想”，我觉得这篇文章太浪漫了，深深的打动了我，你们可能不会理解，我看这篇文章看哭了。对于我这种又浪漫又理想主义的人来说，NFT也许真的是每一个平凡人的机会？如果我能通过Nft来拯救他人呢？\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/70f50f9ef3898ec3.jpg)\n\n## 一个爱与英雄的虚拟城市-2077朋克猫之城\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/3b3a8d404867dde2.jpg)\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/182929274877b612.jpg)\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/85fe97c72005989b.jpg)\n\n我想，为什么我不能在Web3里构建一座虚拟的城市呢？让平凡的普通人也有机会当英雄，看了那么多漫威，DC的电影，里面构建了那么多英雄人物却是虚拟的，为什么普通人不能当英雄？如果以发行NFT的形式，构建一座有超级英雄的城市，里面可以竞选市长，有银行，有金融投资部门，有超级英雄俱乐部，还有娱乐的地方，用NFT销售赚来的钱，拿出一部分救助现实生活中需要被帮助的人，并且以超级英雄的名义给予救助，成立一个艺术基金会，帮助艺术家发行NFT, 做实体世界的品牌联名，开线下的2077朋克猫之城的咖啡厅，俱乐部，把朋克猫做成一个虚拟偶像，拍它拯救人类的视频，做朋克猫相关的动画，游戏，电影，那该有多好？我虚构了在2077这个年份，一个非常赛博朋克的年份，一座充满爱的，有超级英雄的虚拟城市的概念就这么诞生了。\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/b231acd8dc1e84ed.jpg)\n\n我找来了我的妹妹，我们一起设计了创世英雄，我们用斯芬克斯猫做了原型，就觉得它长得挺酷的，第一个诞生的英雄就是Joker。当时我妹妹把Joker猫画出来的时候，我惊叹，这就是我想要的。我觉得小丑就像这座城市的精神，他要颠覆腐败的现实世界，在Web3 创造一个自由的国度，一座爱与英雄的国度。他是自由与反叛的代表，他很平凡，就像我们每个人，但是他又很善良，偶尔有点癫狂，又有着病态的浪漫爱情观。我很喜欢我们创造的这个人物，在2077朋克猫之城的世界里，Joker是我们城市的精神象征。现实生活中我是一个看起来挺柔弱的女生，但是在Web3，我可以扮演任何人，我可以做一个具有反叛精神的冒险家，我可以创建我的帝国，甚至我可以是男性。每一个来Web3的人在这里都可以拥有一个新的身份，新的ID，这不应该是社区，我觉得应该是一座城市。我们有相同的价值观，相同的气质，然后我们聚集在这里，成为在Web3一座新城市的居民。\n\n回想起我上小学的时候，老师问我，你长大以后的梦想是什么？我给老师的回答是“当市长”。现在想想，觉得有点可爱，有点天真还有点好笑，不知道是不是因为这个原因，我想做一座虚拟的城市，我们因为相似而聚集在一起，不再有地域的划分，不再被动的困在一座城市，而是以相似的精神和价值观令我们聚集在这个城市。它应该是无国度的，国际性的，我的理想中，这个城市有来自世界各地的人民，我希望这座城市成为我们的精神乐园，就像头号玩家一样。\n\n### 一名我梦寐以求的合伙人\n\n![新找的合伙人品味绝佳，我们经常打3小时以上的电话进行探讨](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/42b89a23d5451cf0.jpg)\n\n一切进展的很慢，除了意见总是和我不合的妹妹，我对代码，合约技术，和怎么设计一个NFT产品项目一窍不通。在近一个月的时间里，我开始疯狂的学习，加各种各样的区块链群，关注NFT公众号，也就在那个时候，法哥社区的投研报告真的帮助了我不少，那个时候还没有专业的NFT项目中文投研分析，是@NFT_Aerfa专业的投研报告，帮助我这个小菜鸟能够快速成长。整个3月份我都孤军奋战，埋头苦学，一切对我来说都太难了，我没有团队，也不懂技术，甚至连图片生成都不会。\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/057804e1900ee436.jpg)\n\n在3月25日，我终于迎来了我的第一位救兵，我们打了262分钟的电话。他在我的微信朋友圈寻找合作伙伴的时候联系了我，他是一个我平时不怎么联系的网友，经沟通得知，他不但懂营销，设计超棒拿过奖，而且英文非常好（加拿大华裔）我们的理念非常合，他可真是完美的partner！我们都有很庞大的计划，我们想构建一个这样的NFT系列，我们想像无聊猿一样，想做一个知名的卡通IP品牌，想链接现实世界，想做艺术基金会，想做Dao, 想做赛博朋克风的虚拟像素城市。\n\n## 月猴的故事\n\n我和他都非常喜欢这个2077朋克猫之城的概念，我们视如珍宝，又花了一个月时间完善产品，但还是很怕出错。我们改了无数版的roadmap,但是每次写完，发现市场已经把你写的玩过了，我们又只能不断修改新的版本。当时月鸟很火，我们就说，要不我们先做一个试水项目吧？先积累点经验，毕竟如果是第一次就做一个那么庞大的项目，又没有经验，会很容易失败的。于是我们画了第一版的月猴，有点可爱，我很喜欢，但是让大家更喜欢现在的版本。\n\n我们本来找了一个画插画的女生，但是她才画了20%就不画了，可是我也没有画过这种像素风的NFT，我只能边学边画，亲自画完了剩下的所有部件。每一个像素点我都画的非常认真，所幸大家都觉得我们的艺术不错。我还擅自画了一个无脸男的1-1版本，纯个人喜好，我很喜欢宫崎骏电影《千与千寻》中无脸男这个角色。可惜没机会放进去。只能在这里放出来给大家看看了。\n\n![](https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/07/19/27fa93b160c403ad.jpg)\n\n我们还在月猴头上加了一把钥匙🔑，这是一个彩蛋。我们希望有一天能用月猴这把钥匙，打开2077朋克猫之城的钥匙。我们还在官网加了一首彩蛋音乐，是我挑的，音乐是《飞屋环游记》的一首插曲，为什么用这首歌曲，我真的很爱旅行，我希望这一生能去很多国家看不同的风景，完成环游世界的梦想。第二点是这首歌真的很好听，每次听都会让我心情愉悦，我希望能和大家分享这种愉快的心情和冒险精神。我曾看到推特上有人评论说这是他听过最棒的铸造音乐，这真的很鼓舞我，有玩家能懂我的这些小小心思。被陌生人认可的感觉真的很棒。\n\n**合伙人的的中途离开**\n\n在我们的月猴项目进度到80%的时候，他失踪了，微信发了几十条，石沉大海，电话也无人接听。这对于我来说是致命的打击。团队缺一个人，就很多地方都进行不下去了。我很伤心也很无助，沉沦了好几天，还躲在被窝里偷偷哭了一次。可我不想让团队其他成员受到我的情绪影响，如果连我都崩溃了，那其他人该怎么办呢。此时团队里还有另外两位技术成员，一位是负责写智能合约的，一位是负责做网站前端后端的。他们都来自互联网大厂程序员，是我用一通1小时的电话谈下来的。这两位合伙人其实我们彼此都没有见过，我们都非常陌生，不知道网络对面到底是一个怎么样的人，他们仅仅通过一通电话就加入了我的团队。他们如此信任我，我暗自下定决心，一定要对得起他们对我的信任，我一定要让团队里的每一个人都获得回报。\n\n**意料不到的火爆售罄**\n\n由于我最重要的合伙人突然的不辞而别，我一人承担起了做活动策划，写营销文案，做社群引流，负责写多个社交账号，谈商务合作，社群的搭建和管理。我一个人忙的团团转，我在为了一个未知的结果付出了100%的努力。既然做了，我就想做好它。2022年6月28日我们开始正式宣传，我策划了一个帮月猴找香蕉拿免费白单的活动，搜话题#whotookmybananas 还能看到很多人参与了这个有趣的活动。这个活动是我想出来的，仅用了一天时间推特账号就涨了1500个粉丝。3天后，也就是2022年7月1日，我们的项目正式发售。总数是8888张，前1500张是freemint，剩余是0.008e一张，销售速度之快令我意外，在忐忑和惊喜之中，只用了34分钟就售罄了。而在此之前，我根本本没想到会卖完，包括团队里的其他成员也没想到。我们居然做到了！\n\n### 多次的崩溃和哭泣，\n\n**从决定做这个项目开始，我一共哭了4次。**\n\n第1次是团队重要成员的离开，我们一起策划了2077朋克猫之城，通过上百小时的语音，开过无数的讨论会，一起创造了月猴，包括网站也是他设计的，我们沟通了3个月，他却没有任何招呼，不辞而别，当时NFT市场一滩死水，我感到很绝望，想到这几个月的努力全部白费了，而且一想到辜负了其他团队成员对我的信任，我很难过，哭的很伤心。 \n  \n 第2次是在我们项目发售的前一天，负责写合约的技术成员，犯了失误，提前泄露了我们上传在IPFS上的头像，被别有用心的人盗取了所有8888张头像，并在我们公售前就发布了假的和我们一模一样的collection，甚至取了一样的名字，连网站也是原封不动的复制了。我又气又急，我被气哭了。 \n  \n 第3次是推特运营犯了一个非常低级的错误，导致我们的项目遭受到很多负面的言论，一时半会找不到人顶替他，我无助到了顶点，所有人都在期待着我们官方有什么大动作，而实际情况的是那天并没有推特运营的人。这个时候A出现了，他接下了推特，什么回报都没和我谈，他说他也是有冒险精神的人，所以他喜欢我们这个项目，会陪我走到最后。他是第一个站出来坚定支持月猴的人，我哭了，因为感动。 \n  \n 第4次是因为 X，那个我的web3引路人。我看到他买了非常多的，月猴的竞品Nft，我很生气，把他买的月猴全部要了回来。也许我这么做，显得很不理性，因为X，我才会去学习这些对我来说陌生而又的知识，独自探索，一点点进入加密圈，设计了2077朋克猫之城，发售了月猴。他对我来说是很重要的人，但是他却为我的竞争对手站台……他似乎完全不顾及我的感受，每天都能在推特Space，还有推特上看到他身体力行的带货着我的竞品Nft。积累了半年的情绪一下就爆发了，我感到很委屈，对他很失望，我觉得我这半年来的努力不知道是为了什么。\n\n**我不知道大家有没有体会过那种孤立无援的感觉，一个人应对所有责骂和压力的时刻**\n\n团队其他人都是匿名，在卖完那一刻他们就已经退出了。从月猴卖完的那一刻，其实就只剩我一人了。除了几个临时帮忙管理微信群的志愿者，原来的团队走的只剩我一个人。在开售前我创建了4，5个微信群，一共近千人，大家从mint完的那一刻就开始疯狂@我，让我赶紧拉盘，做燃烧，合成，完成发币那种一整套。但是我们根本就没有准备这些，我们本来就是一个没有线路图的CC0项目，我不知道大家为什么每天要我做合成燃烧？\n\n**缺乏经验带来的后果**\n\n我甚至连什么是做市商都不知道，第一天甚至闹出一个非常无奈的笑话，因为海外营销合伙人的离开，推特我临时找了一个web2的朋友，他从美国留学回来，英文挺不错的。但是由于他不懂任何区块链知识，当他漏登记了一个KOL的白名单，那个时候我们已经卖完了，KOL让他空投作为补偿，他回答对方“什么是空投？我们技术不懂空投。”这段对话被KOL以嘲讽戏虐的口气截图发在了推特上，很快就在圈子里传播开来了，造成了很多负面的评论。我不得不让他离开了团队，于是官方推特就突然没人运营了，那天是卖完的第一天，很多人看我们官推没有怎么更新，以为我们要跑路了，纷纷以低于公售价很多的价格砸地板。这个时候我还连怎么批量扫地板都不会，因为我根本没想到会卖完，我也不知道原来做NFT项目是一定要配合做市商的。团队负责做网站的小伙伴可能看我这样于心不忍吧，他虽然已经拿到了钱，但没有完全离开，他人很好，还教了我怎么用Gem批量扫地板。那天是发售完的第二天，我学会了用Gem批量扫地板，0.008的公售价，地板被人砸到了0.003，我用了2个以太慢慢的把地板扫到了0.007，0.008，很快又被人砸下来了。直到第五天，地板直接被砸到0.0018左右（以当时币价大概才1U多），我很费解，GAS费都要这个价格了吧，为什么你们就不能钻石手，再等等呢？\n\n### 每天都有负面指责，但是你的身边却已经没有人了\n\n地板跌了那么多，我一边要在群里安抚大家，一边要找为团队找新的成员，一边要扫地板，一边还要策划后续的官方活动，一边想对策。我累垮了，每天我只能睡3个多小时，饭也只来得及吃一顿，不到一周时间，我就瘦了5斤。压力大到我根本无法入睡，但是我真的很想把月猴做好，把精力专注于继续做事上，我只能解散了每天几百上千条的微信群，社区的志愿者帮忙建了DC（我们没有官方DC , 目前他不回信息，不知道他什么意思，也许以后要重新创建了）后面我又用了2个以太陆陆续续把一些割肉纸手的筹码分批回收了，因为我知道，我还会继续做事的，便宜收回的筹码我可以送给那些真正喜欢月猴的人。\n\n### 看，我们为此做出的努力\n\n* 7月1日公售34分钟售罄\n* 7月2日创建了非官方DC\n* 7月3日 举办了第一期的寻找聪明猴子的解密\n* 7月3日 举办了猴叫 的推特space \n* 7月6日 举办了寻找小金猴的解密游戏\n* 7月8日 举办了挂单0.02，官方随机扫的活动\n* 7月12日 举办了秀出你的冒险家精神的活动\n* 7月13日 提出了招十位大使，探索cc0社区治理的方案\n* 7月13日-7月18日 积极参加推特space,寻找大使和社区经理中\n* 7月19日 讲诉月猴的故事 《月猴的前世今生：种子，英雄，冒险精神》\n\n无论再多的负面言论，压力，哪怕原团队只剩我一个人了，中途我也多次经历崩溃想放弃，但是还是咬牙在坚持，我们没有停止过尝试和努力。\n\n**以上，就是月猴的故事。**\n\n**没有什么牛逼的项目方，只有一个对Web3带着憧憬和梦想的女生，却经历无数挫折，困难，压力，期待奇迹，还在努力坚持的故事。**\n\n## \n一封诚挚的邀请信\n\n有人问我，为什么不Rug , 我的回答是：一开始我可能是为了一个男生进入了这个圈子，并且开始做NFT的项目，但是这趟加密旅途中，我遇到了一些真心帮助我的小伙伴，结交了一些友善又有爱心的朋友，包括那些信任我的初始的团队成员 ，我们素未谋面却相信我的能力，加入了这个团队。还有1760holders(不包含纸手），还有目前DC里的那495位月猴家人，还有现在正在帮我那些人，我觉得我要为他们负责。但我深知，没有团队，一个CC0项目，最重要的是社区，没有社区这个项目很快就会被大家渐渐忘记而逐渐死去，就像那100个NFT项目里面死掉的99个一样。\n\n所以，接下来，诚邀10位具有冒险精神的大使，参与一个伟大的冒险旅程。\n\n让我们来做一场社区实验：除了欧美项目mfer，韩国项目MimicShhans，我们中国 为什么不能拥有一个有自己的社区文化精神CC0项目呢？\n\n《Web3小图狗是否能通过社区共识成长为小蓝筹的实验？》\n\n如果你看了我的故事，和我一样具有冒险精神，你觉得你也是这样的人。\n\n如果你觉得我们志同道合，愿意一起探索社区运营，一起造梦。\n\n也许努力过后，你最后只得到一堆不值钱的小图片，你也不会后悔。\n\n如果你还有兴趣，请往下看。\n\n我将把月猴彻底去中心化，关于月猴未来的发展，所有决定以社区投票来进行。以“Dao”的形式运作，80%的交易版税给予社区，其中65%给多签钱包，给十位大使和开发团队，15%用于社区继续运作，比如生产周边，资助月猴家人举办线下活动等。所有重大决定，由社区投票决定月猴未来的走向。我作为月猴的创作者，会以社区贡献者之一的身份继续参与这场社区实验。其实这么做的国内项目方，愿意把交易版税大部分给社区的应该只有我一个，并把权力交还社区，实行真正的去中心精神，给一些有才能的人一个已经搭建好的舞台。\n\n### 十位月猴大使是怎么规划的？\n\n* CCO   名额6位，宣扬社区文化，喜欢开推特space聊天，有自己的观点喜欢当发言人，也能主持space,推特已经有一些粉丝，认识一些加密圈大佬，能创建微信群并带大家一起活跃起来。期待有2位老外或者华裔加入。\n* 社区经理   名额1位，管理MOD，商务洽谈，定期举办社区活动（每周至少1次），海外用户的维护，英语流利，能独立参加AMA解答问题。\n* 推特运营   名额1位，运营官方推特账号，和活动策划一起举办官方活动。\n* 活动策划   名额1位，负责官方活动的文案和落地执行\n* 商务经理   名额1位，负责帮我们月猴的家人谋求福利啦\n\n**关于大使的回报，你能得到什么？**\n\n一次真正能实操参与web3项目的经验，一场充满冒险的社会实验，一次展示你能力的机会，你的履历会更丰富，你会获得很多成长，你会认识很多人脉，一群和你一样爱冒险的冒险家\n\n5%的永久版税收入+50张月猴NFT\n\n**另外月猴可能会增加新玩法，需要3位开发团队**\n\n合约工程师（写过智能合约，技术高超，懂多签钱包）\n\n前端+后端（会做适用于web3的网站）\n\n美术（月猴新头像，表情包，活动宣传图，网页UI）\n\n5%的永久版税收入+0.5eth（或者50只月猴NFT)\n\n## 如何报名\n\n①我们会在月猴的Discord开设一个报名大使的频道，大家去频道里报名写下你的履历经历和联系方式，符合要求的我们会主动联系你！[DC链接直达](https://discord.gg/AsEFq45HrU)\n\n②直接推特联系我，发你的CV！[@PKCC001](https://twitter.com/PKCC001)\n\n**新增的赋能** \n\n如果你想做NFT-头像类项目，或者想从我这里学点什么。 假设你买了10张月猴Nft，可以推特私聊我，预约1次和我通话的机会，时长是10分钟。 买了30只月猴Nft，那就是30分钟的时长。 在这里，我个人推出这项服务，是为了感谢那些一直支持月猴的大户和钻石手们。\n\n**关于月猴未来的探索**\n\n未来会走向哪里，我也不知道，看社区的小伙伴愿意带着月猴走多远吧，如果可以的话，我们想做新玩法，甚至带月猴进元宇宙。噢！还有头上那把该死的钥匙，我希望能启动它，让它能打开2077朋克猫之城的门！\n\n### 最后写给Web3的新人\n\n\n像我这样没资源，没人脉，也不懂区块链知识的普通人，都可以通过不到半年的自学，从零学习如何做一个NFT项目，达成八千多张NFT全部卖完的小小成就。对于半年前的连推特都不会用的我来说，想都没想过能够走到今天这一步。\n\n在这个加密世界，真的可以创造奇迹，只要你拥有好奇心，对于新知识的有强烈渴望和探索，敢于冒险，即使遇到挫折，困难也不放弃。建议大家多学习web3需要用到的技术，比如学习用Solidtiy语言写合约 , 适用于区块链的网站前端后端，画PFP的配件（像素风，3D ,插画风），推特运营，社区管理，也许你只用了一周的时间，就能赚好几个月的工资。但是实践经验也很重要，团队一般不会用没有经验的人，风险太高了，所以有机会就一定要多参与Web3的项目累积经验，哪怕初期没有回报，实操的经验是无价的。\n\n比如，我们团队里写智能合约的小伙伴是匿名的，通过这次写合约收入约为12eth，按今天以太1500u的价格，约为18000usdt。大家也知道以太坊的价格过两年会涨，等两年就60000usdt了，这可能是很多人在Web2里一年的工资收入。所以这就是web3令人惊喜的地方，选对人，选对团队，你所学的web3技能一定能给你带来意想不到的回报。遇到合适的机会就紧紧抓住吧，时间会给你回报的。\n\n**月猴欢迎每一位冒险家的加入！**\n\n在此特别感谢帮助过我的朋友们

Space 举行线上直播，本期主题“艺术赛道 NFT 的演变之路”，邀请 Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）、Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Therisverse）共两位嘉宾参与圆桌讨论。这是 0x499 旗下 DeTalks 栏目第 22 期，主持人来自 Dinglun（NFT collector & investor）、MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）。以下是直播内容摘录：**\n\n**Dinglun（NFT collector & investor）**\n\n欢迎大家来参加今天的推特 Space，今天非常有幸请到 Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）作为分享嘉宾，先有请他做一下自我介绍。\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\nHello 大家好，我是 Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人，今天非常高兴有机会聊聊关于艺术 NFT 的演变之路的想法，欢迎大家一块参与讨论。\n\n**MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）**\n\n我们今天也是同时邀请到 Therisverse 的 Co-founder Hyphen，首先我个人也是非常喜欢 Therisverse 的理念，强调“跨过分歧、拥抱不同”的核心概念，引起了 Z 世代的强烈共鸣，也可以说是真正将社会议题融入到 NFT 艺术品的理念中。同时恭喜 Therisverse 经过一年的筹备，在昨天白名单 Mint 阶段全部售罄，那么先请 Hyphen 简单介绍一下自己。\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Therisverse）**\n\nhello 大家好，我是 Therisverse 的创始人和艺术总监，很高兴今天有机会跟大家介绍 Therisverse 的发起和理念，也很期待跟大家一起聊天。\n\n@**guooooog**\n\n大家好，我是毕业于中央美院实验艺术学院，现在主要从事生成艺术方面的创作。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT collector & investor）**\n\n今天的话我们都知道， James Jeans NFT Holder 可以在 Outland 线上兑换实体版画，谁有资格获得？非 holder 或者其他人有无可能/怎样参与其中？\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\nOutland 今天正式上线了 James Jeans NFT 项目，大家可以凭借自己的积分去兑换一张对应到自己 NFT 编号的实体版画，这个版画有专属钢印和 James Jeans 签名。\n\n我们推出这样的实体版画原因有两个，第一是想通过新的玩法，也就是积分和 Merch 之间的配合，让大家了解其实 NFT 可以跟线下产生联动、产生赋能。这种积分机制和之前出现过的 实体作品以及 NFT 销毁不太一样，比如说达米安·赫斯特先生推出的方式。同时这也是我们预期的可以去激励到 NFT 流动性的一种方式。\n\n第二点其实这是 James Jeans 自己的想法，他看到大家的热情，对于第二个章节的期待，就希望能够给大家更多福利和关怀，让大家可以亲手触碰到艺术，让艺术品进入到大家的生活空间当中。\n\n基于这两个原因，Outland 在现在这个时间点推出 Merch 平台，也算是回馈社区的小小努力。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT collector & investor）**\n\n对于 NFT 一直以来最大的争议就是，买 NFT 就是买 JPEG 甚至是买空气，那么像这次兑换实体版画的活动算是给了相关言论一个有力的还击。Outland是如何与世界范围内头部的艺术家共同构平台愿景的？近期有什么样的计划和大家分享？\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\n之前并没有像 web3 区块链这样的技术以及社区，能够帮助艺术家第一时间和对自己作品感兴趣、喜爱自己创作的朋友达成一个连接。比如说像方力钧老师、James Jeans 以及我们未来要推出的艺术家，他们最开始了解到 web3 和区块链的时候，更多的印象这就是一个技术，但实际上当这个技术落地到社区建设、作品研发和平台发行的过程当中去的话，就发现是非常有血有肉有细节的。\n\n我们发现很多艺术家非常有意愿能够多做一些什么，能够和喜爱自己作品的朋友达成一种连接。在这样一个背景之下，我们觉得并不一定非要区别所谓的 NFT 和线下艺术品之间的明确界限，我们相信当不同的产业和领域都落地到 web3 当中的时候，线下和线上联动会更加紧密。\n\n在这样一个愿景之下，艺术家和 Outland 平台一起做了个未来规划，也就是说之后所有上线的作品肯定在某些方面有前瞻性或者创新性的，我们希望 Outland 能够将原来在殿堂之内的艺术带到大家生活当中去的一个中间桥梁这么一个平台。\n\n**MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）**\n\n我想问一下 Hyphen，你在纽约的所⻅所闻是否对你的艺术创作产⽣了影响，你在这个年纪为什么会思考平等並且关注不同肤色人种的权利？那么Theirs NFT 在后期会有什么赋能呢?\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Therisverse）**\n\n我是大概两年前去纽约，我从小在台北长大，接受的是美国教育体制。所以并不是到纽约才有这种感觉，从小我就能够感受到文化冲突，在学校的时候可能会觉得自己像一个美国人，虽然我不觉得自己是美国人，但表现得比较美式，回到家聊天又会比较传统一点。\n\n所以小时候成长过程我就不太有归属感，跟我们这边称之为“很台”的那些人没办法打上真正的交道，但是跟老外也没办法完全融入，我一直到现在都是跟国际学校的人比较好。这种没有归属感到纽约之后更加凸显，小时候以为只有我这样，到了纽约之后发现大家都这样，因为纽约很少土生土长的人，我认识的都是从不同世界不同地方来的人。\n\n我觉得很重要的一部分是，世界越来越国际化，每个国家都是。过了二十三十年，我不会很意外每个国家都充满不同的人群。那我觉得从现在就要开始为这种国际化的到来做准备。因为从小我长大的地方都是亚洲人，到国外有很多文化差异，不止是要去尊重，还要去学习。如果你不去学习的话，不会知道要如何待遇别人，这种世界观是蛮重要的。\n\n在纽约身为少数民族的亚洲人或者黑人、或者无性别主义者，或者 LGBT 人群，这些不是主流群组的人，我觉得我们看了美国的历史，才发现抗争了那么久猜到了这个（平等）的地步。当世界慢慢国际化，网络让世界被拉拢起来，我们需要知道的一件事情是，不能在重复这种错误，重复有哪一种族群比另外一个族群强大的观念，而不只是扣上说说而已。\n\n但是现在的种族歧视可能更隐晦，比如我到了美国，可能跟我国内朋友说中文的时候，有一个白人就跟我说，你说韩文的声音真好听。其实我想说我已经跟你说过几百遍，我是在讲中文，这两种语言在我们听起来是天差地别的。\n\n虽然他们不是恶意，我觉得身为亚洲人，我们对黑人和白人也会有各种偏见，那么要去除这些标签，包括肤色、性向、性别、贫富差距、年纪差异，不是我们看不到差别，反而要去欣赏，更加升华他们的文化，这是 Therisverse 很重要的一个人物。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT collector & investor）**\n\n如何看待NFT对艺术行业的影响，web3对当代艺术家的创作到底是冲击还是帮助？所谓的传统艺术家和NFT原生艺术家是否有本质上的不同？艺术家该如何加入到NFT的世界中来？\n\n@**guooooog**\n\n原生加密艺术家跟传统当代艺术家还是有很大区别。\n\n首先是原生加密艺术家熟悉整个加密赛道的玩法跟规则，甚至很多加密艺术家是程序员，非常熟悉计算机美学、代码美学和匿名性。刚才 Hyphen 提到种族平等的问题，web3 等于把所有人拉平了，我其实更喜欢匿名艺术家，而不是实名艺术家。\n\n因为实名之后，艺术家的身份和背景资料都会被看到，当然现在还是 web2.5 阶段，信任机制还没有那么完善，匿名性是 web3 很重要的一个属性，不管你是什么背景、什么资历，只要作品好、表达的内容非常有意思，提供给行业的东西有创新性，大家就是认可的。\n\n所以说这是非常好的一件事，也是 web3 最有意思的一个部分，因为传统当代艺术圈有很多问题，比如权利集中化，由策展人、美术馆这种机构、评论家、画廊、拍卖行整个体系形成了一个标准，如果这种标准一直持续下去，是会形成非常垄断和精英化的局面。\n\n当然现在包括 Artblocks 在内也是这种有点传统的方式去输出作品，也有一些平台不是这种玩法，我觉得未来会越来越少，因为现在是 web2.5 还没有完全去除这些东西。\n\n不管是当代艺术家还是加密艺术家，代码、程序和区块链技术，底层逻辑都是一种媒介跟语言，他们都可以基于这种语言去创作一些很好的作品。但是对 web3 不太熟悉的当代艺术家来说相对还是有一些困难的。就像文艺复兴时期透视学的出现、油画语言的出现、包括能够随身携带颜料去快速画一些户外风景，这些其实都是技术带来的革命，本质就是一种语言。\n\n当代艺术家在传统语言体系已经把握了这种玩法，语言熟练程度非常高，但是加密艺术是一套新的体系和新的语言，当代艺术家需要熟悉这种语言才能创作出很好的作品。对于加密艺术家来说，也要熟悉一些当代艺术和传统艺术圈的玩法跟体系，才能创作出更好的作品。\n\n当然很多传统艺术圈的人进入到加密艺术之后会被啪啪打脸，是因为加密艺术圈的很多玩法和体系跟传统是不一样的。从某种程度上说，其实 NFT 是一种革新和范式，它需要去迎合原来当代艺术的标准吗，我认为完全不需要。这两个领域可能是相互融合相互促进的并行状态，它们并不打架。\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\n在最开始我们去接触艺术家的过程中，发现尤其是一些年龄比较大的艺术家，对于整个区块链和 NFT 技术可能没有一个明确的概念。但是，以我从策划阶段跟方力钧老师接触为例，当代艺术家有一个优势，就是天然骨子里去反叛、去革新、去突破系统性桎梏的意识，其实 Outland 就要做这个桥梁作用，让他怎么能够意识到能够利用技术去做这些事情，在一个新的语境当中有东西可以去表达。在这个过程中我们遇到了很多困难，将困难一一化解之后形成了现在项目的一个基本局面。\n\n但是我想聊的东西要稍微深层一点，就是什么是艺术。在我看来的话，艺术是能触碰人心灵的东西，不管是当代艺术家还是 web3 原生艺术家，其实肯定有一些东西是打动你了。有一个项目是来自印尼的小伙子，把自己每天的照片拍了一年，放到 Opensea 上，卖得还是非常好的。其实这个东西在我看来有一个打动人的地方，就是在 web2 当中并不会引起大家注意的一个东西，在 web3 得到一个价值的肯定。\n\n所以我觉得应该找到一个东西，无论是现代的还是传统的，都是一个工具，可以帮助我们去穿通歧视和不公平，能够让大家意识到好的氛围和有趣的地方，这是 web3 打动我的地方。\n\nweb3 突破了原有作品的边界，把作品边界和真正购买 NFT 的人连接到一起，中间的这个过程其实具备很大的革新性，让艺术家和对自己作品感兴趣的人连接到一起。\n\n从这个角度来看，这也是符合艺术的规律。之前艺术的革新只发生在作品的内部，未来到了 NFT 领域可以将革新从创作的单边过程，变成一个完全双向或者多向的过程。我相信这是无论当代艺术家还是加密艺术家非常友好的地方。\n\n**@AnnieYi**\n\nHello 大家伙，很高兴能够邀请 Hyphen 这么年轻的艺术家和 Outland 这样的优秀平台一起 AMA，我感到非常荣幸和骄傲。\n\n其实我自己是 James Jeans NFT 的持有人，Hyphen 知道我非常喜欢他，在全球买他的版画。但是我要说一下，我觉得碎片化的叙事方式，并没有把 JJ 的叙事性打破。我自己很喜欢的一点事，他的画特别有趣，有非常多的细节，每一朵花每一个角落，每一件东西都有诗意般的叙事能力，但是当它拆成 NFT 之后，变成了不同的叙事碎片，其实既可以拆解，又可以拼起来，所以艺术变成 NFT 是一个特别梦幻的联动。\n\n比如说来自 16 个国家的艺术家并没有见过面，更多的就是透过一个核心叙事，大家共同创造，通过机器随机生成，生出全球独一无二的样子。所以如果打开 Opensea 看到那些图多么丑，由科学家在淘宝随便找个人画的土狗项目的时候，你真的觉得艺术应该要进入 NFT 里面，因为我们把整体艺术交给全球有钱的买家，很多商人到最后靠买艺术品展现自己的品牌，有些商人会开以自己名字命名的美术馆，像美国纽约那边有很多，来供大家欣赏。你会发现艺术一直是一个非常高成本的东西，但是通过 NFT 让每一个年轻人享受审美，持有审美，而且是全球独一无二随机性的审美，这是一个很浪漫的过程。\n\nHyphen 也可以分享一下，他在做 Therisverse 的时候，其实是有很大的核心思想，他认为艺术不是一个自私跟自我满足的过程，每一个持有人都参与了创作。我认为 NFT 跟艺术未来是应该紧紧绑在一起。\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Therisverse）**\n\n我觉得很重要的一点是 web3 的去中心化概念，不仅是技术上的去中心化，同时也是理念上的。不再看什么是主流、什么是非主流，什么是正确的审美，什么是不正确的审美。\n\nTherisverse 的 Slogan 就是“不完美，即是完美”。这个完美不是说每个人都有自己的完美，现在社会对完美只有一个一致的定义，同时这个定义又在变化，很多人回去盲目跟随。特别是在web2 社交媒体上，很多人去看网红，修图美颜到完全不真实的姿态，全部都很自我。web3 所有都和你的环境和社群有关，非主流才是真正的主流，每个人都可以找到喜欢自己艺术创作形态的人，我觉得这是很重要的，这是 web3 最看好的地方。\n\n很多人对 web3 有质疑，这也是可以理解的。我经常跟朋友你去想手机是好是坏，好的地方是你可以随时跟亲戚、朋友、恋人说话，很方便很发达，但同时也有隐私这些问题，最终还是取决于用户。\n\n我不能以 web3 做保证，但是我能保证我们的社区是以连接人们为中心的，我希望做一种互动性的艺术，而不是 everything is about me，像是在一个艺术馆里面去看一副作品。我大概一开始作画的时候就有这种感觉，不是以自私的心态去创作艺术，反而是以交流的心态，比言语更升华的一种互动。所以 Therisverse 是一个平等的多元文化的社群。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT collector & investor）**\n\n从 Beeple 的 NFT 拍出 6900万 美元天价一举成名开始，似乎代表着 NFT 开始带着艺术行业走向另一个全新的方向，但是 Merch 某种程度上意味着艺术的价值正在向传统靠拢，怎么看待这种反叛与回归的结合？\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\n我们一开始的时候其实也请教到像 Beeple 这些在 web3 非常成功的艺术家，有关于艺术这个赛道在未来的发展方向。同时也有很多其他朋友接触到我们来聊可以不可以进入加密艺术领域。我相信像娱乐、电影、大众流行文化相关的东西，落地到 web3 当中去的时候，可能我们现在的讨论都不再是一个问题，包括它应该是更倾向于线上，还是要和线下联动，我觉得也不再是一个问题，到那个时间点我期待的是物联网的达成，区块链作为底层技术更加方便的生活场景的普及，那时候应该不存在传统艺术还是 web3 艺术，只存在大家喜欢或者不喜欢的艺术，无论是传统艺术像加密艺术反叛或者反过来，都是可以随时发生和接受的。\n\n比如说我们接下来即将要推出的一个项目，可能会一反像 James Jeans 从观念故事性上去推出的 NFT，和实物之间有一个密切的连接。现在这个项目是技术导向的，我们从 Artblock 等生成艺术上获得了很多灵感，就是在目前这个时间点，我们应该把艺术往哪个方向去浅浅地推进一下，其实在一个比较广泛的视野当中，还缺少一个原生于区块链属性的作品，我们和艺术家之间进行沟通，去创作一个这样的作品，通过 AI 算法根据你的交易判断性格，做出时间线上的变化，哪怕交易之后也能够记住上一个主人的特点，这也是一个非常不一样的角度，一个非常原生 web3 的角度去跟艺术家合作。\n\n所以我们其实并没有限定我们自己是传统的，还是 web3 的，我们更希望看到更多有趣的项目通过各种各样的方式出现，当这样的东西越来越多的时候，那可能这个问题就会消失掉。\n\n**@AnnieYi**\n\n我其实蛮遗憾的，大家提到 Beeple 的时候都在关注拍出了多么高的价格，是不是第一个艺术 NFT，却没有人看过这一幅画。我想应该没有人像我一样，认认真真去打开 5000 幅画来看吧，他其实是把这十四年的生活，每一天画一幅画。成为数字艺术之后，可以碎片化去持有，想象我是一个有钱人去买了这个 NFT，我把我家的墙投影出来这 5000 张画，这就是一堆数码影像，但是当我把它每一张打开的时候，有几幅画是我自己非常非常喜欢的。我希望大家在理解艺术之前，要了解它是怎么撼动人心的。\n\n虽然 Therisverse 很幸运，发行 4 个小时就售罄，在熊市 0.18e 也不算便宜，很多 freemint 项目都没有发完也没有人领。我们在 24 小时登上了 Opensea 第五名。但是我依然希望大家看到这 16 个年轻的艺术家，每一个系列背后的灵魂，每一幅画都画了好久。我们总共做了 4 次生成，这在其他项目绝无仅有，包括 Hyphen 他很坚持一些东西。所以说不要看成绩有多少，整个 Therisverse 艺术创作花了一整年，而 Beeple 用了十四年，没有人知道，认为他只是一个普通插画师，他的老婆怀孕，他穷得不行的时候没有人看见。\n\n所以这也是我非常喜欢 Outland，在整个 web3 行业里面的作用。当你在熊市中打开小狐狸钱包，不是一张丑到不行的作品，没有任何审美意义。你知道这是艺术家付出了时间，是艺术家的心血，付出了跟世界的对话，跟自己的和解，跟世界的抗争。Hyphen 在画的时候是一个卡夫卡的读者，是一个虚无主义的小孩，他把 Therisverse 画得像翻白眼一样，我是怕卖不出去，但是他有他的抗争。\n\n所以每一个艺术背后都不是随随便便的，我自己比较遗憾的一件事情是，像 BAYC 背后的画家，到现在已经几乎完全被遗忘了，而且她还是一个亚裔。所以艺术一定要有改革，排挤出那些土狗项目和仿盘，发挥出中本聪真正去中心化的理念，让更多年轻的艺术家不用等到 45 岁或者更久之后，才有机会出来跟跟大家交流，这是 web3 最大的价值。\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Therisverse）**\n\n我好像是 15 岁左右，开始喜欢法国哲学家，对存在学很有兴趣，会读卡夫卡那类的书。我印象很深刻的一个主题是，我们人类的存在比我们的理由先到来。我读的时候有点奔溃，人类这么有智慧的生物，有那么多无尽的选择，我们其实活在一个最差的宇宙。我们有那么多选择，反而活得那么忐忑和慌张，运作在腐朽的政治之上，女生不能主宰自己的身体，他们如果不想生一个小孩，还要违法去堕胎。所以那时候我想做另一个宇宙，大家都可以更好做自己的版本，那个对我来说成长影响蛮大的。\n\n@**guooooog**\n\nNFT 纯数字化和经典的实物艺术作品，这里面有一个词叫在场，很多艺术创作印刷出来看和你现场欣赏完全是不一样的。NFT 有“在场”吗，在场性还很低，当你用眼睛去看手机、看一个屏幕，范围很小，未来如果 AR/ VR 起来之后，在元宇宙里面去看，场景是不一样的。所以实物还是解决了一些在场性的问题，就是你观看屏幕和你拿到实物去细细地品是不一样的，我觉得这是很有意思的一个事情。\n\n**Dinglun（NFT collector & investor）**\n\nOutland 作为艺术类 NFT 运营得非常好的平台，非常注重线上线下的互通以及社区文化的建设，请问艺术类 NFT 可以为不能从美术馆、拍卖会的购买艺术品（高净值客户，物单价高），大多数人带来什么？\n\n**Charlie Han（ Outland 产品与亚洲市场负责人）**\n\n这也是传统艺术会面临的问题。之前跟方老师之间有一个聊天，有些很大牌的艺术家进入一个误区，当他背后有一个非常有实力的人可以去支持他创作自由的达成，在原来中心化时代里面，他们做的一个事情就是把源远流长的艺术史价值化了，这个东西的背书要远远大于某一方的努力，如果 outland 只是从运营和市场价值角度把桥梁搭建起来，其实还是需要一个新的推动建立在大家的共识之上，很多土狗项目有值得大家学习的地方，就是他们在凝结共识的过程当中可以摒弃很多不同的意见，那这个东西的话其实在传统艺术是完全没有出现的。我们应该如何去看待呢，你发现很多土狗项目虽然过几天就下去了，但是并没有如大家想象的那样完全归零，反而是最开始建构得非常好的项目，最后可能并不是运营得特别好。所以到底什么是最核心最主要的，这是一个很有意思的问题。\n\n另外一方面来讲，高净值用户和人群，他们进入艺术之前的惯性，是这个时代局限决定的。我也跟很多线下的投资人和收藏家聊过天，其实他们对传统的美术馆的话也不是很满意。那 NFT 出现之后，我还是这个观点，现在客观情况出现了明显的分野，但是后续发展不见得不可以把 web2 比较有价值的作品带到 web3 里面来。比如说我们在 March 之后的安排当中，方老师可能愿意拿出自己不同时期留藏得版画作品，拿出来到 March 当中去，让大家更多从价值角度体会到 web3 时代的到来。\n\n**MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）**\n\n想问一下 **Hyphen** 你是如何跟全球十多位艺术家合作，怎么领导设计这些pfp，有什么意义\n\n**Hyphen（Co-founder and Art Director of Therisverse）**\n\n我们设计环节最重要的一部分就是全部手绘的，每一个艺术家自己选择要做什么 collection，每个人都会研究很久。其中一个核心概念就是，如果我们要讲一个不是我们的故事，不是有历史年代性和文化根底的故事，一定要穿透到表达的本质。我非常执着于研发的过程，其中一个 collection 印象蛮深刻的，本以为会是很浮夸和女性化的，我看到之后反而觉得特别好，并没有哪些固有的预设，并且是在我和那位艺术家完全没有串通好的情况下。\n\n还有另一个 collection 特别能体现目前年轻人的迷惘跟堕落感，活在一个科技感，但是又随时有可能被战争和政治毁灭的世界，我觉得蛮能体现自己对未来的憧憬和现况的失望，对我自己冲击蛮大的。我没有问那个艺术家是不是有这样的创作意图，但是我自己看到的感觉是这样的。这也就是我为什么觉得艺术这么有趣，因为每个人都有自己的解读和深刻的体会。\n\n**MIKI（0x499 Core Contributor）**\n\n我们知道Theirsverse计划设立年轻艺术家基金，并且已经在全球多地开展青年论坛，Hyphen可以具体分享一下吗?\n\n因为最开始做这个项目史灵光一闪，最开始跟我妈开了一个买手店，放了一些名牌产品。我就想这些牌子都已经这么有名了，还需要我们帮忙卖吗，直接去旗舰店买不就好了。我觉得反而这种买手店需要给更多年轻艺术家平台，不仅仅是衣服、还包括音乐、艺术等等。那时候我就觉得要做这么一个平台，让年轻艺术家把自己作品宣发到全世界的媒介。\n\n因为我觉得传统的艺术阶层很分明，如果你红的话可以一直红下去，如果没红的话就永远不会红，很棒的是经过这么多年，我们有了 web3 这么一种技术跟机会，成立年轻艺术家基金会，给那些比我还有才华，又没有那么多资源的艺术家扶持。\n\n我们会组织各种各样的论坛，每个人都要跟世界有交流，第一是去了解跟你不一样的人，第二是看到即使我们在完全不同的体系长大，感受到的情绪可以是一样的，每一个打动人的故事都可以引发共鸣，我们做这个平台就是要产生不同的共鸣，这是对我来说很重要的东西，找到一种宇宙性的语言，让世界各地的艺术家来讲故事，每个人都可以讲自己的故事，还可以了解到你的故事是有人聆听的。在这么一个安全的地方讲故事之后，可以再去现实世界讲更多的故事。\n\n\n---\n\n```\n

Please do your own research.*\n\n\n---\n\n## Becoming a better communicator\n\n> **You wrote an article six years ago called “Your career is a startup: What every recent grad needs to know.” The big piece of advice was to communicate better and build a personal brand, and that the trajectory of your career depends on the quality of your communication.**\n>\n> **What were some habits or tactics that you used to improve the quality of your communication, whether verbal or written?**\n\nThe article is a bit of a CliffsNotes for a longer book by Reid Hoffman called “[The Startup of You](https://www.startupofyou.com/)” that I was reading at the time.\n\nI was asked by a computer science professor at my college to give a talk to the students there about their careers. They were third years or something and working really hard. They were really tired and all checked out. I was like, “your career is a startup and you have to think about the marketing of it. You have to think about the talent that you are building inside of this startup and how you communicate that to the world and how you frame it to people.”\n\nOnline social media has given a platform for people to communicate their skill sets. All of the connections in web3 happen on Twitter. People reach out on DMs and that's how they get jobs. That's how I met [Denis](https://twitter.com/Iiterature). That's how we co-founded Mirror and that's probably how I got in touch with the Dharma people early on.\n\nA lot of stuff happens on Twitter and it's also just where you demonstrate a lot of your knowledge. Just being able to communicate technical concepts on Twitter is incredibly important and valuable, because a lot of people are watching. Even if they don't follow you, they get to see it because somebody likes it or it's just relevant to their feed.\n\nPeople get to see it, and they read it and it's just advertising for your personal brand. And I think that would be really good advice still for people who are entering the job market just to continue to use these social media platforms to build up marketing for your skill set and also network with others.\n\n> **How would you recommend people to improve communication on Twitter?**\n\nThe caveat would be that I only know Twitter, cause I'm a little bit older.  It does seem that Twitter is where a lot of the more serious people are.  People in the VC space that you might want funding from one day, or founders and CEOs, those people do tend to be on Twitter and I think the content is a little bit more thoughtful.\n\nSo that's still probably where I would target and then I wouldn't worry about being cringy with the tweets or something. I think it's just more important to develop the skills.\n\nIt's just practice, right? You're just getting in these repetitions, where you're trying to communicate technical concepts to a broader audience and some of them will hit and some of them won't, and that's how you'll learn what you're doing well and where you're probably being either too technical or not being clear enough.\n\nI think that just doing that is valuable because you'll have to learn a lot of concepts in order to communicate in that way, which will help you when you're doing technical interviews. The interviewer will ask you, \"okay, explain how this front-end framework works\", and maybe you'll have written about it. You'll just be good at explaining concepts. That will definitely set you apart from other people who are also interviewing who just haven't had that practice or don't get that exposure.\n\n> **I think I remember that one of the first jobs that you had landed…communication played a part there because you had already written about a topic that the company was either brainstorming or thinking about.**\n\nWriting is the chance to get it right. Whereas, like in an interview sometimes, somebody will ask you a question and you might not word it perfectly. They might ask you some technical concepts, and it really helps if you've taken the time to write it out or something beforehand and think through it.\n\nIn that particular case, I believe it was something like this. All of the startups at the time were trying to think about moving to microservices from a monolith architecture or something like that. There were a couple of books written about it, and I had gone and read a couple of those books and I had thought through the topic and expressed an opinion. Maybe it was a contrarian opinion, like \"No, you shouldn't take your monolith app and break it down into microservices unless you were at a certain scale.\"\n\nThen, when the company interviewed me, they read that and they said, \"this is something we were actually thinking about doing and what you're saying makes a lot of sense. And that's how we know you could be a senior engineer because you can think through these architectural topics.\"\n\nThose sorts of things are amazing because if somebody stumbles upon them they can really get a sense of the way that you think about things and they can see how you fit into the company. Just by doing that, you have a head start on your competition.\n\n## Practical tips on interviewing\n\n> **When you were working at RaiseMe, you interviewed hundreds of candidates. For people who might be interviewing for companies in the future, what advice would you give to set themselves apart from others?**\n\nWhen you're actually interviewing, in the moment, there's a lot of performance pressure. There's a lot of preparation that you can do beforehand. It's just like when you're going to school and you're doing the SATs and stuff. You just wanna do as much preparation as you can before.\n\nSome obvious things to do would be to interview at a lot of places and get experience interviewing. When you're doing those practice interviews, ask for feedback and say, *\"what could I have done better?\"* Don't worry about getting rejected; just try to interview at a lot of different places, try and understand their team and how their team works and try and see how you might fit into their team.\n\nYou always have to have the frame that you're also interviewing the company. It's not just one way. I think that that will go a long way because it shows a real sort of interest in the company. Companies tend to like that. And people sometimes miss that when they're interviewing. They don't really express a lot of interest in the company itself.\n\nAn example would be actually using the product that you're interviewing for. So, if you come and interview at Mirror and if you haven't set up a Mirror blog, it just shows that maybe you didn't take it that seriously as a potential company.\n\n> **Especially for web3, I think it's pretty important to make sure you've used the product before you're actually interviewing at the company.**\n\nI think that that goes hand in hand with taking yourself seriously as a candidate. So if you really consider yourself and your skill set to be very valuable and you go into an interview and you think that you might have a shot at joining the company, I would hope at that point that you really care about the product and you think it's something that you'd like to spend two years working on…two of the most energetic years of your early twenties.\n\n> **I think the problem that I've noticed from people in their early twenties when they're interviewing is it almost feels like a second job. So you have to strike a fine balance where you're applying to many places, but you're also applying to places with products you understand and with people that you would enjoy working with.**\n\nEverybody's different. I applied early decision for college and then got accepted and went. Then I applied only to around three companies when I was doing my first job out of school. I've also always been on the founding team of companies.\n\nMy particular way of thinking about something is quite radically in line with just high conviction. I want to understand the company really well and then start building relationships with the people there and then join. So I don't take the approach of interviewing at a lot of places, but I do think that is still good advice if you want to be good at interviewing.\n\n## Picking the right place to work at\n\n> **If you're looking at applying to, let's say, only a few companies, how would you actually select them?**\n\nThe most important thing, I think, early in somebody's career is to know what skills the person wants to develop and find a place where they can really work on those specific skills and then combine that hopefully with a place where the people that they're going to work with are people that they want to become more like.\n\nYou're going to be spending a lot, many and many hours, every single day with the people at the company that you are joining. Hopefully, those will end up being lifelong friends as well. So you want to pick companies that have people that you really respect and admire.\n\nFirst is your skills: find a place where you can get the best skill sets. And then, second, people that you want to be around. So those are the things that I would optimize for first and foremost.\n\nI think another aspect would be the sector or the industry. I think that is important too. But I would say that that is more important later in somebody's career. Not necessarily in the beginning, because at the beginning, you're forming your skill sets and your personality in the workplace. You want to model that on people who you already respect, and you want to maximize your skill acquisition.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about the sector, if that makes sense, as long as you can get the skills that you want to. So if you want to learn machine learning, for example, you don't necessarily have to optimize for being in the machine learning industry, as long as you can do it somewhere that is reasonably good. Build up your skill set, and get some good recommendations. And then, from there you can shift to wherever you want to.\n\n> **One philosophy that I've heard that's pretty similar to what you're saying is when you're looking at your companies and picking between the two, just look up the people who are in senior positions at each of those companies and see which of those people would you rather be more like. Because that's a reflection of who you're going to be in a few years from now.**\n\nIt's an empirical question. I would say it's probably very important because even if you join a small company, the leaders will hire people who are like them. If you're going to be in a place for two years and around a specific culture, that will shape your personality, shape what you think about, the kind of media that you probably consume through the Slack channels, and all that stuff. And then, the way that you express yourself will become modeled on the leadership in the company and the way that they present themselves in all hands, things like that.\n\n## \\[BONUS\\] web1 vs. web2 vs. web3\n\n> **Could you explain the differences between “web1”, “web2”, and “web3”?**\n\nThe internet has had three phases so far: web1, web2, and now web3. Each phase was started because a new technology was introduced. web1 was blogs and static content like Wikipedia. A blog is just a list of posts ordered by date. They link to each other with HTML, so HTML was really the technology that powered that version of the web. That's what kick-started web1.\n\nweb2 was the social web. It included interactive gestures, such as retweeting and poking, and liking content. This was powered by a technology called AJAX which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. And that lets you have a more complicated interaction with a webpage.\n\nThese interactions were usually social, so this phase is known as the social web and then the data from all of these interactions would feed into AI algorithms that order newsfeeds and timelines. So web2 is really signified by the feed and the timeline, which is, again, ordered by the social interactions that people are having with the content. To monetize, platforms inserted some ads into the timeline and this birthed a massive industry of social networks like Facebook and Twitter, and they basically just let people join the network for free. Then they took the data and used that to power advertising.\n\nWhat about web3? What makes that different? The technology that birthed web3 is obviously the blockchain and blockchain introduces scarcity to the internet. This allows you to mint and own limited edition digital items. So those can be coins like Bitcoin and Ether or collectibles like NFTs.\n\nSo if web2 was really about social interactions, maybe web3 is about ownership. So instead of liking content, now you can actually collect it. Artists can mint their digital work directly like music and art and writing, and then fans can go and collect those items in their digital wallets.\n\nCollectables have obviously existed for a long time, from ancient precious stones to baseball or Pokemon cards. But now we have digital collectibles, which promise stronger ties to creators.  This also promises a stronger concept of membership in an online community. So the whole mechanism is similar to collecting art in the offline world because it's made up of creators and collectors and curators.\n\nBut, collecting digital items has massive advantages over private art collecting. Just as a comparison, when you collect an artwork privately, it sits in your house and only a few people see it. But if you collect an NFT, it's still free to view online. And millions of people can see that you own it on your social profiles. So it can sit on Twitter or Instagram and be verified as an NFT that you own, and that can be proof of fandom. Even if the creator becomes very famous, you'll always have that proof of fandom.\n\nFor example, I worked with a digital artist on an NFT in November 2020, and we minted it for collection. That artist – [@pplpleasr](https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1) – actually went on to become very famous a year later. She designed the cover of a fortune magazine, “Crypto vs wall street”, and basically sold over a million dollars in NFTs. If I had just liked *pplpleasr*’s work, I wouldn't have had anything to show for that early belief in her talent.\n\nThe token infrastructure gives a way for us to prove early fandom and then also for the artist to bootstrap a membership network over time. So the artist could go and airdrop new tokens to early collectors and send them messages on these emerging web3 social apps, et cetera. The same thing extends to music. So you can own an album of an Indie musician that you like, and if they become famous, you'll always be this verifiable early fan. You'll be able to trade that just like an early collectible on a marketplace.\n\n## Incentive models in publishing\n\n> **The publishing industry has all sorts of incentive models that incentivize writers to write. For example, the New York times is paying journalists and Medium uses an algorithm to give out a portion of its revenue to writers, and Substack lets you create your own base of subscriptions.**\n>\n> **Comparing these different models, how would you explain Mirror's incentive model to people and why it might be better than other ones?**\n\nAt the moment, Mirror is experimenting or working on a concept called [writing NFTs](https://dev.mirror.xyz/5gt60vKFJZ_tR1BjoJ7-Y0sNw7REebStHjzFU5x73J0). So writing NFTs, as you can imagine from the name, is a way to mint an NFT from a piece of writing.\n\nSo, for example, if you go to my blog, [g.mirror.xyz](https://g.mirror.xyz), my latest article is called \"Write to Learn\". Now, you can mint an NFT of that or you can purchase an NFT of that article, which sort of makes you a collector of a piece of writing.\n\n*Collection* is this sort of new social gesture in web3. I think of it as being a progression from the web2 model of liking and resharing things. Resharing is like retweeting. And liking is like feeding the algorithm with some data while saying \"I enjoyed this piece of writing\", or \"I enjoyed this tweet or photo\".\n\n*Collection* has this economic aspect to it. It's got a new dimension to it. It entails ownership. So when you go into Foundation and you see an artwork that you like, instead of clicking a *like* button or a *heart* button, you can actually “collect” it. It's almost like being an art collector in the private art collecting world. But instead of there being some sort of like gallery or dealer that you're working with, you're just buying it directly from the creator.\n\nThere's this very tight relationship between the creator and the collector that is being expressed through web3. We tend to think that this is very interesting for communities and for what you might think of as fandom.  We’ve had this influencer culture in social media where people are dependent on platforms like Instagram or something to build a big audience. Then they put adverts and that sort of thing to monetize. Now, there's this direct relationship between the collector and the creator, like the fan and the creator. It's much easier to get started because you can just mint these things on blockchains and all you need is an Ethereum address.\n\nWe see something interesting happening there. That model has yet to play out fully. We've had one cycle of NFTs, and it had a bubble, but it wasn't fully expressed because the blockchains didn't scale properly and only a couple of people were already doing it and they were doing it in very specific and contrived ways (making profile picture photos and that sort of thing).\n\nBut I think for the next cycle, we'll see many more expressions of artworks, whether they're music, writing, photos, or digital images that get expressed as NFTs. And people will collect them. That will create this interesting relationship between the collector and the creator. Maybe that's just the new form of a social experience.\n\nHow does that compare to the traditional writing model? I think it allows you not to have gated content, for one. Typically the model would be that you need to subscribe and pay a subscription fee of $5 to $15 a month or something, and then you get access to content. Then, the creators are like on this treadmill where they have to just produce content every week because they have this subscriber base that they need to cater to.\n\nNFTs work differently because you're just selling an artifact of something that somebody really likes and they want to collect – they want to own it. If it's a beautiful photo, they say, “I would want to own that and put it in my house”. And maybe they pay $10,000 for an image or something that they would typically just put in their house and it's private and only 10 people would ever come to their house and see it.\n\nBut now, they get to own it and put it on their social media profile and it's all verified. Then millions of people can see that you're the owner. Maybe you have a lot of pride in that. You get to present yourself on the internet as an identity. It's just a whole kind of new world that people can be part of, and it doesn't require gating the content. I think it makes content more open but people can still pay for the content.\n\n## How collecting fixes the economics of publishing\n\n> **There's a quote from an article that you wrote: \"web3 moves beyond the like and share primitives of social to include a third and more powerful gesture: collect\". I think it's really interesting how the economics of liking and sharing are different from those of collecting.**\n\nYeah, definitely. Then you also get this interesting market dynamic where you get to price it a little bit differently. So if you sell something at 0.1 ETH and then it ends up selling for 3 ETH on the secondary market, that will give you feedback on like how to price your work in the future, where maybe you don't get that on subscription models.\n\n> **It's almost like an instant piece of feedback that lets different pieces of content have variable levels of value. If you were using Substack, let's say, each piece of content would be treated unanimously because you're charging five bucks a month. For everything that you create, it's almost like a standardized price.**\n\nI just think that is a really interesting question, because in traditional literature if you have the first edition of something, it's worth quite a lot. What you're saying is that in traditional online media everything is super commoditized. The best article is worth the same as the cheapest article in some ways. But that wasn't true before the internet.\n\n> **I think the underlying problem seems to be the incentive model itself.  Platforms like Substack, by encouraging subscription models, are commoditizing your content at a  uniform level.**\n>\n> **I think what Mirror opens up is…you get to create a different market for each article that you're writing and some markets might be more valuable, some markets might be less valuable, but that way you get to play around and get feedback on what people actually want. That is a bit more difficult in traditional companies.**\n\nFor sure. And people don't actually have to price everything. I think that's something where there's been a little bit of confusion with our launch because we set this default at 0.01 ETH or something per article. But I think, especially when L2s become even cheaper, once sharding is implemented on L1s and et cetera, it should be almost free to mint something. I think it's going to be very cheap and the writers don't need to set a price. It can be free.\n\nIn that world, collecting looks very similar to the \"like\" of traditional web2 platforms. You're just saying, “Oh it's really cool, I like this article and I wish I had some stronger bond with this person or I wish that people could see that I like this.” Those are the reasons why you would like something. I don't think people are explicitly thinking, “I really want to like this so that I can teach the AI algorithm how to sort my feed.” In most cases, people are just liking something because they want to experience a connection with the creator.\n\nI think that collecting NFTs will be similar where it can potentially be free or priced at a small amount. That's like this micro-tipping idea that people wanted to have in the early internet.\n\nWe can start with simple things like writing. I always want to start with really simple examples. When I started in DeFi, I just wanted to do a lending and borrowing protocol. And now in the NFT space, I think just collecting pieces of writing is a really good place to start. Let’s just see how it works and what this relationship looks like with collectors and creators and how that modulates the economics of the Internet in a positive direction because it's quite bad right now.\n\n> **When people are collecting, I'm sure there's some inherent need or desire they have to show the pieces of writing that they're collecting. How does Mirror replicate that intrinsic need?**\n\nOne of the important things about NFTs is that they are available outside of the platform where you collect them. So, if you collect something on Foundation, you can display it in your Rainbow wallet, or you can display it on [gallery.so](http://gallery.so), or wherever you have your address.\n\nIt doesn't have to be the place where you store your private key. It can just be any gallery. So the onus is not necessarily on Mirror to show the collection, although we will have that. We'll build all nice tools, something like Pinterest does where you can group things and show people your collections and your playlists and all of that stuff. But ultimately what's really cool about NFTs is that people can build these as separate spaces, online and in VR as well. I think that will be very cool to see.\n\n> **What you're thinking of Mirror, then, is more as a marketplace for now. Its focus right now is on matching people who want to collect good pieces of writing to people who produce good pieces of writing.**\n\nAt the moment, it's very much focused on the creation process. There's an editor where you can go and type things into a text box and then you can sign it with your private key and then mint it as an NFT. It's very much that early part of the cycle where somebody's creating something, they're minting it, and then people are finding it and then collecting it.\n\nThat's what we're practicing at the moment. Can we get product-market fit? Can we get this new behavior working in the market where people come to use this product to create things and mint them and collect them? Beyond that, we'll continue to build things and we'll support people in terms of how they want to display their collections on Mirror through a profile. We'll explore all of those things and try to figure it out in the next couple of months.\n\n## The story behind crowdfunding on Mirror\n\n> **Given finite bandwidth, I'm sure you often have to choose between features that writers want versus features that readers want. So how do you prioritize between the needs of the two sides and has this prioritization changed in the past year and a half?**\n\nIn Mirror's history, we did a lot of other things. One thing we experimented was with minting an essay as an NFT, but actually crowdfunding the production of the essay before. There was this essay that John Palmer wrote called \"[Scissor Labels](https://j.mirror.xyz/RUeJfZEZxr-hkuzUCakQyUuf2kOJVMPPiAWBaQFhhqc)\". And he minted that as an NFT with the ticker $ESSAY, but before writing it he actually did a crowdfund on Mirror for funding the production of that essay.\n\nSo investors would come and they heard the story of what he wanted to write. And then they pulled money into the smart contract – that was the Mirror crowdfunding contract. Then, he was able to take those funds and use them to fund writing the essay. And then he sold the essay as an NFT for a couple of ETH and the ETH went back into the crowdfund. That allowed the original investors to redeem the underlying ETH in the crowdfund by basically exchanging this token that they had received for backing the crowdfund. Then they could get their funds back with some profit.\n\nSo that was crowdfunding on Mirror. We started with this idea of being able to fund writing with crowdfunds and then have them sell as NFTs and then investors could get their money back. And then we decided that the crowdfunding contract was actually quite valuable and people had not already done crowdfunding well in web3 yet.\n\nSo, we had this idea of doing embeddable crowd funds and there've actually been quite a lot of projects that have started as Mirror crowdfunds. For example, there are documentaries by Ethereum that have raised about $3.5m. A DAO wanted to buy a basketball team and they raised a couple of million dollars, I think, through Mirror crowdfund.\n\nFor a long time, we were actually iterating on this concept of crowdfunding for various cases and having crowdfunds be embedded into blog posts. So there's actually been a competing prioritization between these web3 blocks that you can embed into mirror posts – and you can think of those as plugins – with a core writer experience.\n\nThat's something that we've resolved this year where we really want to focus on the writing experience. We've deprioritized these plugins, like crowd funds and additions and these other things that you might have seen in the plugins tab of the dashboard.\n\n> **If people are able to crowdfund entire documentaries on Mirror, to me it almost seems like there is a huge demand for an entire ecosystem or tool by itself just for financing creative projects through web3. Have you ever thought about launching a spinoff from this plugin?**\n\nYes. We thought about that quite a lot because it's quite an independent battle to build a product like that. There are a lot of regulatory requirements that you would need to pull something like that off unless it's fully decentralized. There are projects like SyndicateDAO that are doing that, and then there are more decentralized ones like Juicebox.\n\nMirror had a very good crowdfunding contract and people were using it and it worked pretty well. It was safe to use, which is quite a lot to say. In the space, if you have something that works and it's safe to use, that's usually quite a good sign. But I think it's not something that we want to focus on as a company. We just are more passionate about the writing use case. A lot of the people in the company come from places that have done writing projects. That's just where a lot of our passion and energy wants to go.\n\n> **Where do you see Mirror going in terms of this prioritization? Are you still going to be focusing on writing experience as much?**\n\nNow that we're focusing more on the writing experience, we really want to polish things up. A lot of the prioritization is just to make things more robust and make things more scalable. We want to make that really robust so that writers can just feel like this is something that is a viable alternative to a platform like Substack.\n\nIf you're in the web3 space and you want to use an Ethereum address to sign your posts, it needs to be a credible alternative to Medium or Substack or something. It can't be the web3 jank version – it has to be high quality. We want to make it polished and make it a really pleasant experience, so all of our attention is going into that.\n\n## Why \"liking\" was bad for the Internet\n\n> **There is a quote from an article you wrote a while back that says, \"liking is definitely not as cool as commenting. And I think liking might actually have been bad for the internet in general because it perpetuates status anxiety. I think vanity metrics are overrated.\"**\n>\n> **How would you approach any kind of interaction on the Internet without creating vanity metrics?**\n\nThe problem with web2 – liking in particular – is that there was no monetization model for it. So you just had everyone online, posting things to get likes. It didn’t breed a lot of quality. In a lot of cases, it just bred things that made people outraged or sparked emotions. That's like the resharing in particular.\n\nThere's this great article by Jonathan Haidt in the Atlantic, called ‘[Why the Past 10 Years of American Life Have Been Uniquely Stupid](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/)’. He talks about the reason that people retweet things and reshare them. The reason why is because they're generally outraged about a topic and it's created negative emotion, or it's just fake information. Fake information spreads way faster than truth on the internet. So that's where a lot of liking and resharing comes from; it comes from mistruths or things that are emotional. It's not necessarily things that people feel like they would want to own.\n\nCollecting might be different in that sense. It has a sort of different feel to it that we're going to see play out on incident. I'm not sure what it is yet, but I think that it's probably something where the quality of the content is higher.\n\nSo, people don't have to be these content machines for advertising because they're actually monetizing the content itself. The content is the economic good. That's not true of tweets, for example, or of Facebook posts or something. I think that's a dynamic that will be different in web3 and I’m looking forward to seeing how it plays out.\n\n> **Are you worried that the pricing of any art on web3 might in itself create a vanity metric, where people are using its value as a status signal?**\n\nIt seems quite likely that that will happen. It's very early to have an opinion on whether that is good or bad. There might be some early indications of the over-financialization of media. I think we just need to be thoughtful and then hopefully we're writing and talking about it in public discussions. But it does seem that some of that is gonna happen for sure.\n\n## Advice and resources for others\n\n> **If you had to give any piece of advice or share any kind of resource with Gen Z'ers interested in web3, what would it be?**\n\na16z has this YouTube channel from about a year or two ago, called the [Crypto Startup School](https://a16z.com/crypto-startup-school/). I think that would be a really good place to start. They interviewed all of the “OG” people in that course.\n\nI also think that this is a space in particular where people are very receptive to conversations. So reaching out to people that you want to talk to, and just having a conversation with them, I think, is very easy to do in this space.\n\nThe whole time that I've been part of it, I've always been able to reach out to people on Twitter and just have a conversation, get their feedback on things that I've been thinking about, or set a call.

The FBI noted that 244 people had already fallen victim to these fake apps.\n\nOne case saw cyber criminals convincing victims to download an app that used the same logo as an actual U.S. financial institution, encouraging them to deposit cryptocurrency into wallets purportedly related to their accounts.\n\nWhen victims attempted to withdraw from the app, they would be asked to pay taxes on their withdrawals. However, this was just another ruse to part more funds from victims, as even if they made the payments, the withdrawals would continue to be unavailable.\n\nAround $3.7 million was defrauded from 28 victims between December 2021 and May 2022, said the FBI.\n\nAnother similar operation saw cybercriminals operating under the company name “YiBit”, defrauding at least four victims of around $5.5 million between October 2021 and May 2022, using a similar method of deceit.\n\nA third case involved criminals operating under the name “Supay” in November 2021. They defrauded two victims by encouraging them to deposit cryptocurrency into their wallets on the app, which would then be frozen unless more funds were deposited.\n\nWarnings about fraudulent apps have also made the rounds on crypto Twitter.\n\nOne user said a friend recently fell victim to a scam that started on the online messenger service Whatsapp which encouraged the victim to download a fake crypto app and load funds into the app’s wallet. A week later, the crypto app vanished.\n\nAnother user says they have fallen victim to a fake Ledger Live crypto wallet app, reportedly called “Ledger Live Plus,” in the Microsoft app store. The user claims the fraudulent app has already stolen $20,000 from him. \n\nEarlier this year, cybersecurity firm ESET uncovered a “sophisticated scheme” that would [distribute Trojan applications](https://cointelegraph.com/news/13-apps-removed-after-researchers-uncover-trojan-crypto-wallet-scheme) disguised as popular cryptocurrency wallets.

The FBI noted that 244 people had already fallen victim to these fake apps.\n\nOne case saw cyber criminals convincing victims to download an app that used the same logo as an actual U.S. financial institution, encouraging them to deposit cryptocurrency into wallets purportedly related to their accounts.\n\nWhen victims attempted to withdraw from the app, they would be asked to pay taxes on their withdrawals. However, this was just another ruse to part more funds from victims, as even if they made the payments, the withdrawals would continue to be unavailable.\n\nAround $3.7 million was defrauded from 28 victims between December 2021 and May 2022, said the FBI.\n\nAnother similar operation saw cybercriminals operating under the company name “YiBit”, defrauding at least four victims of around $5.5 million between October 2021 and May 2022, using a similar method of deceit.\n\nA third case involved criminals operating under the name “Supay” in November 2021. They defrauded two victims by encouraging them to deposit cryptocurrency into their wallets on the app, which would then be frozen unless more funds were deposited.\n\nWarnings about fraudulent apps have also made the rounds on crypto Twitter.\n\nOne user said a friend recently fell victim to a scam that started on the online messenger service Whatsapp which encouraged the victim to download a fake crypto app and load funds into the app’s wallet.

It is really worth applauding them. \"It is more blessed to give than to receive\". Many people do not understand the true meaning of this sentence and ask questions. They think it should be \"blessed to receive than to give.\" True happiness, a feeling of contentment and calmness. In the article \"Saving the Starfish\", some people have doubts: There are thousands of starfish on the beach, like the stars in the sky, and doing so will not change anything. He smiled, still bent down and picked up another starfish again. When he threw the starfish into the sea, he murmured, \"The fate of another starfish has been changed.\" It seems very insignificant under the environment, but it still has its power and effect, just like \"the fate of a starfish has changed again.\" The meaning of this sentence is the same, a person's power is very small, but if you can push yourself and others, everyone The love you exert will be immeasurable, so don't underestimate your contribution.

From me, that's the most important thing.\n\nAbout Wisdom——“Wisdom circulates in our life, like a clear spring with a clear spring.” One of them is called “Transforming the quality of the soul”. One day, a little girl visited the orchard and saw a big watermelon, and wanted to buy it. \"That big watermelon costs three dollars,\" said the owner of the garden. \"However, I only have a triangular amount of money,\" said the girl.

是一个许可的权益证明 (PoS) 区块链网络。 它由被称为 Hedera 管理委员会的 26 家全球企业管理，社区通过 Hedera 改进提案 (HIP) 提供意见。 3/ 2022 年第二季度是加密货币历史上糟糕的一个季度，加密货币总市值下降了 58%。 @hedera 本季度末价值为 $1.4B，本季度下降 71% ($3.3B)。 下跌使其与更广泛的市场一致。 4/ $HBAR是 Hedera Network 的原生代币，最大总供应量为 50B，且无通胀。 在 2022 年第二季度收盘时， @Hedera 的循环供应量为 21.08B $HBAR （占总供应量的 42%）。 5/ 总交易量大幅下降。 在 2022 年第二季度， @Hedera 平均每月交易量为 19MM，低于 2022 年第一季度的 76MM（-76 %)和 2021 年第四季度的每月 99MM（-81 %)交易）。 6/ @hedera 核心产品是 Hedera 网络服务。 这些服务是一组 API，允许用户创建帐户、铸造代币、将数据写入分类帐、调用智能合约以及执行许多附加功能。 7/ @Hedera 生态系统的另一个组成部分是 NFT 的兴起。 在第二季度，Hedera 有来自 8,260 名用户的 258,000 笔 NFT 交易。 8/ 自智能合约 2.0 推出以来，开发人员的活动一直呈上升趋势。 在 2022 年第二季度， @hedera 平均每月有 6,000 个开发者活动事件。 2022 年下半年的首要任务是对智能合约服务进行额外更新。 9/ 尽管存在熊市，但 2022 年第二季度对于@hedera 生态系统来说是一个繁忙的季度。 主要发展包括： +生态系统基金 +HIP 406：放样 +漩涡 +其他活动， 10/ 2022 年下半年将忙于@hedera 。 优先事项之一将是成功推出 Staking。 测试预计在第三季度开始，社区节点将在第四季度启用。 11/ 尽管更大的加密货币市场遭遇惨败，但@hedera 继续增加，并出现了积极的趋势。 从@NickDGarcia 探索关于@hedera Q2 2022 状态的完整报告。\n\\*\\*NEAR Protocol,@NEARProtocol,Official

{"id": "t4w3Jx-trgwgNHJHiUcq9DP1toeDG9sjeh_AbCpbrZ4", "title": "gratitude", "body": "Before this, I didn't know gratitude. Of course, I know what gratitude means and how to do it, but I don't. All I know is that teachers often tell us to be grateful to our parents; parents often teach us to be grateful to those who help you. As for the practice, it is nothing more than a \"thank you\", a smile, or a little material reward. We are \"told\" to be grateful since childhood, because that is what a good heart needs. However, this formulaic brainwashing leaves me confused - what is gratitude for? In order to bring yourself closer to the image of \"kindness\"?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nBn7oX0D7X3U3SQrQ0A1y.png?height=442&width=304)\n\nThis story in \"Chicken Soup for the Soul\" reminds me deeply——\n\nIn New York, there is a young man who tries his best to praise strangers he meets every day with a friendly attitude. His friends were puzzled and thought he was a naive species on the verge of extinction. The young man didn't take it seriously, he said, \"I'm just taking the lead. I believe a little compliment can put a driver in a good mood all day, and if he has 20 passengers today, he'll have an attitude toward 20 passengers. Kindness, and these passengers are infected by the driver, and they will also be kind to the people around them. In this way, my kindness can be indirectly conveyed to more than 1,000 people. I want to make New York more human, so that the city can be saved. \"\n\nHe is infecting the people around him with love, just as Zola said - love does not grow old, it retains eternal flame and immortal brilliance, and the existence of the world relies on him as nourishment.\n\nIt doesn't tell me what gratitude is, but it tells me what love is. I believe that the reason why human beings live in groups in the world is because of the subtle and beautiful emotions between people. Maybe you often quarrel with your parents, but you never allow others to insult your family; maybe you often complain about the harshness of the teacher, but you never allow others to abuse your class; You will never allow others to trample your country... This is our innate intimacy, the unbreakable bond that can be explained by love.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/K8j2B6O2W46W2w73EGkEm.png?height=165&width=304)\n\nI love my relatives, I love my friends, I love my teachers, I love my family, I love my collective, I love my motherland, I love my earth, I love all the closely related things on this earth everything! I, we, we all love each other's blood, structure, and soul, because we are all human beings, from the same family that can never be separated!\n\nI don't know what gratitude is. I only know that the world needs love and everyone's love. The most beautiful things cannot be seen or touched, but can be felt with the heart, so only by connecting our hearts together can our blocked blood flow, gather, and rush into the ocean. Love needs to be infected. The cry of one person cannot spread all over the world, but the voice of all mankind can shake the earth. When others smile at you, return a smile, he will be happy to smile to more people; when others help you, return a thank you, he will be happy to help more people; when others teach you the truth , In return, he will be happy to teach more people knowledge... We encourage and infect each other unknowingly until everyone smiles.\n\nIs this gratitude? I'm still not sure. All I know is that people should put themselves in their shoes, not those who are happier than us, but only those who are more sympathetic than us. When we are encouraged by others in times of hardship, we will remember to encourage those who are more difficult than us; when we are blessed by others in times of misfortune, we will remember to bless those who are more unfortunate than us; When we accept help from others, we will remember to help people who are more down-to-earth than us... We support and rescue each other subtly until everyone is happy.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kadmnGsHaUUTmgv97hZWG.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nShould this be gratitude? Maybe. Some people may say that this is too idealistic. However, Shakespeare once said, \"Unfortunate! When we indulge in our sins, the wise gods close our eyes.\" Happiness. Try to think, you can eat delicious meals that your mother or father cooked for you; you can learn infinite knowledge that countless predecessors have discovered at the cost of their lives; you can breathe freely Air, which is deposited by the earth over hundreds of millions of years... If you can imagine their hardships, you will feel so blessed to have it all.\n\nThis is just gratitude, right? I don't like the word \"thankful\" very much, it always feels a bit passive, and I like to call it \"infection\". Our every gratitude is actually infecting more people, intentionally or unintentionally, to feel the subtle and beautiful love between people.\n\nJust like \"Hell and Heaven\" in the book - someone talks to God about heaven and hell. God had brought him to hell, a room with a large crowd around a pot of broth, everyone seemed malnourished, desperate and hungry. Everyone had a spoon that could reach the pot, but the handle was longer than their arm and couldn't get things into their mouths. God took him to heaven again. The conditions here are no different from hell, a pot of broth, a group of people, each with a spoon of the same length, but they are happy and happy. The man said, \"I don't understand, why are they happy and the people in hell are miserable?\" God smiled and said, \"Because the people here feed others.\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BCQhq2HzOKqGUeHMb3yw5.png?height=240&width=240)\n\nOur earth is called the world because of love. Infection, or gratitude, is to spread the seeds of love. The version of \"Chicken Soup for the Soul\" that I read hardly mentions the story of gratitude, but I think this idea is hidden behind each of its stories. It tells us what love is, an emotion that has been inexplicable since time immemorial. It taught me to feel love, to enjoy love, to spread love, to infect love, to be grateful for love.\n\nYes, this is gratitude. All love needs to be felt and affirmed.\n\nAfter human beings explore space and conquer nature, they will find that they have a greater ability, that is, the power of love. When this day comes, human civilization will enter a new era. ——\"Fa\" Chardin\n\nOur civilization will enter a new era, because of infection, because of gratitude.", "timestamp": 1658197566, "digest": "ijw1vd4UM54VUy-uHxnzsQXfLbQM0PQgc5ieiPPW9HE", "contributor": "0x0E2Dcd6E8f0F7843b544041546b8c6e85EFd71C2"}

As a highly distracted individual, I’ve struggled a lot in finding focus.\n\n### Creative History\n\nI grew up submerged in the art works of Hayao Miyazaki, Rumoki Takashi, Eiichiro Oda, Masashi Kishimoto. Basically anime was my only focus as a kid. I would spend the whole summer watching anime, reading manga. I was inspired to draw from an early stage, all my text books were filled with cartoon characters and story lines. Becoming a manga artist and story teller was my dream as a teenager.\n\n![Meanwhile in Parallel Universe](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bg_I7Wx27V7oRISpFBl2j.png?height=790&width=1024)\n\n![Pyramid in Japan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eRlTsvGgYXRflZfGuLflr.jpg?height=1024&width=1024)\n\nMost of my early work got lost in chaos… but in this [really old website](http://animateception.com/art.html) you can find more of my illustrations.\n\nAt the time, I was also fascinated by the idea of world creating and immersive technology. I realized that things like AR, VR and interactive machines had so much more possibilities than just illustration -- now you don’t just have a piece of drawing, your can create animated virtual worlds and machines that talk to each others.\n\nThe idea of creating art with advanced technology was a game changer for me, I started branching out from just illustrations to interactive art and programming. Making physical interactive art with Arduino and exploring all sorts of sensors. You can find more of these work on this [really old website](http://animateception.com/project.html).\n\n![Interactive Soundbox - Mr.Icebox](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UOJy87UoJl0PklTPF77-O.png?height=1360&width=1200)\n\nOne thing led to another, I landed in the world of game development. I realized that there are physical limitations in the world of hardware hack, which at the time I didn’t want to deal with, I wanted to create art that doesn’t obey the rule of physics, have an empty space for just imagination. I made games about [Taoism](http://animatedreality.com/opposites-a-black-n-white-poem/), prototypes on [generative cities](https://www.instagram.com/p/Byqwdo8gRZu/), an [‘AR’ cooking game](http://animatedreality.com/another-test-post/), a [backscratching simulator](http://animatedreality.com/scratch-my-itchy-back/), and more…\n\n![Despina - a procedural city generation attempt](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s09Z-4Qfphyh111poG88N.png?height=1422&width=1422)\n\nMaking games were a ton of fun, and also a very hirable skill. I soon started working in the AR industry in Santa Monica LA. It was great work and the working environment were friendly and encouraging. I worked along some top talents of the industry and was learning a lot every day, making [Augmented Reality tutorials](https://support.lensstudio.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052632811-AR-Scavenger-Hunt).\n\n![An AR Scavenger Hunt game I made with tutorials.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u10ecjhf5K82lKyllqStf.gif?height=211&width=640)\n\nThings are going great, but I was going through a very existential time. Living in Venice LA, having many friends and fun things to do, hiking, surfing, skating, house partying. It was almost too perfect and worry-free of a lifestyle, and that bothered me deeply for some reason. I couldn’t figure out why.\n\nI thought learning more skills can make this feeling go away, so I got into [DJing and music production](https://soundcloud.com/syntonikka), played around with [generative visuals](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIP7kxXFNqZ/) with TouchDesigner.\n\n[Making 3D art](https://www.instagram.com/syntonikka/) also became a casual hobby. I loved creating these psychedelic ‘new age’ spiritual renders of imaginary places.\n\n![Desert Wanderer](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GwZ3x2gkSoLBf_DrAhVEf.JPG?height=1568&width=2824)\n\n### Some Mental Struggles\n\nThese creative hobbies were able to make the existential feeling go away temporarily, but not completely.\n\nAt some point, I started hating on all these creative expressions. I felt they were very indulging, they weren’t making the world a better place, they’re worthless inventions and fulfills nothing else but my own artistic ego.\n\nI wanted to learn more about the other side of the world, aside from working and exploring creative tech, I started to research about the reality of our society, challenges we are facing as a species, falling into internet rabbit holes about the environmental crisis, the housing crisis, collective existential crisis and much much more…\n\nThe life I lived in LA felt like an illusion, a retired heaven, almost too peaceful and perfect. I realized that the rest of the world don’t live like this, wealth inequality and inflation was skyrocketing every day, there are so much societal issues going on and merely recycling and donating to homelessness doesn’t seem enough.\n\nI felt like I was in such a lucky position to have so much abundance, and I’m not really elevating the world around me if all I did was indulging in this abundance. \n\nI started to doubt the use of art, I felt like creating art was not gonna save the world, art has become highly commoditized, mostly a way for the rich to store value. My passion for art was fought every day by this thought that art is useless.\n\nI thought of going to school for environmental studies, maybe join a research lab on the issue of recycling, or start an internship at an environmental non-profit. At the same time I was intimidated to ‘give up’ all my years of training in the field of interactive art, and start from ground zero again.\n\nAnyways, this mental struggles went on for a while, I stopped creating and was just reading about the environment, existentialism, ways to ‘solve’ worlds’ problems and such. \n\n### First Eco Village Visit\n\nI lived on the Big Island of Hawaii for a few months, during which I visited an eco village called [Cinderland](https://www.ic.org/directory/cinderland-ecovillage/). It was what you would call a complete ‘hippie’ heaven. People grew fruits and farmed bees for a living. Most people had no job or any social responsibilities.\n\n![Cinderland Eco Village](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hZu_ewjMDFMhdeqLyQcnK.jpg?height=427&width=760)\n\nI was amazed to see how people lived in a carefree and ‘eco-friendly’ way. I know this lifestyle probably isn’t sustainable or acceptable in a lot of places, but I had the idea that this can be an inspiration for many of us.\n\nI left my job a few months after, and embarked on a journey to explore eco villages and ‘alternative living’. I believe people whose stories aren’t up on the internet might have a lot to teach us, and indeed I was able to find so much inspiration from the places I visited, and people I met.\n\nThrough my travels I also slowly realized that no single person can uplift suffering of the entire world. Essentially everybody has their own struggles to go through, and everyone was meant to be their own saviors. That doesn’t mean that we should stop caring about the world, but instead we should recognize our limitations and our strength.\n\nI started to realize that I might not be the best researcher or writer, and it wouldn’t be effective for me to dedicate my life into doing things I’m not good at or things I don’t love, and I wouldn’t create much impact if I wasn’t living authentically.\n\n### The Art of Ikigai\n\nAs I was coming close to a full circle over my love and hate towards my creative expression, I stumbled upon the idea of Ikigai.\n\n![The Japanese philosophy of living in full authenticity -- Ikigai](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YP44NW-TjdizpwxsMftZJ.png?height=640&width=640)\n\nI have had many hobbies, many directions in life, believed in many theories and contradicting philosophies, and I started to realize that all of these are valuable insights that can be braided into my creative expression. I realized that I’m not gonna be the most impactful if I don’t pursuit my authentic passion to do creative work, and art can be used as a medium to spread a message, to uplift, heal and inspire the world around us.\n\nAfter much back and forth, debate and self-hatred, I finally come to full circle towards my feelings for art, and felt ready, once again, to devote myself into what I enjoy doing the most.\n\nI still believe that the art industry (or any other) has been highly capitalized and commoditized, that popular art are filled with people creating shinny objects for attentions, from overpriced JPEG to galleries of infinite snobbiness and abstractions --- but it doesn’t mean art can’t be honest and impactful.\n\nIf we combine art with ideals to make the world a better place, art can be immensely powerful. Art is also a day-to-day practice, the more you do it, the more cohesive your artistic language would be.\n\n### Agartha Village\n\n*This article marks the beginning of a 4 week residency hosted by [Forefront](https://twitter.com/forefront__), a creative collective in the web3 space. HUGE shoutout to Forefront for encouraging me to explore my creativity, and giving me the time and freedom to explore as much as I can.*\n\n[Agartha](https://agartha.one/) was launched as a project to promote [eco village and solarprunk living to the general public](https://www.notion.so/Mission-Paper-ec7cd6959bce4437ad0a3417bf01ef6b), which is something I care deeply and passionately about.\n\nFor the past months, Agartha has been a platform for people interested in the same subject to come together, share resources and exchange ideas. We’ve published our [first article](https://medium.com/@agartha.one) among many other planned, about the effectiveness of eco villages as an alternative living solution. \n\nSome ethos of Agartha are described in this graph.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zljYsV3wOB72jb0OESLI5.png?height=1432&width=1159)\n\nIf you’re interested in meeting more like-minded people to talk about solarpunk lifestyles, come !join our community [here](https://discord.com/invite/b9v5YM9hwJ)!\n\nI’ve decided to combine my knowledge in interactive and digital art creation with this mission to build regenerative eco villages into one project: **Creating concept art for eco villages to fund building of the physical Agartha eco village.**\n\nI’ve been extremely excited to work on this, and will spend the next 4 weeks working intensely on this project.\n\n![Me realizing I can do what I love and contribute positive impact to the world](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Bu_bikzy7biQLy2HffBp.gif?height=207&width=498)\n\n[Here](https://www.figma.com/file/ByZXa2xmghWRoRcI1vLmty/Solarpunk-Village) is a concept board I’ve been putting together for the Agartha Village. \n\n![Energy/Water Flow & Components of a Solarpunk Village](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4Tj98Jrgm0Y-o7a_TmCfo.png?height=1534&width=2830)\n\nAnd [here](https://www.are.na/nico-shi/agartha) is the moodboard for Agartha. (inspired by religious temples and culturally diverse architectural designs)\n\nThe Agartha Village is something I strive to create as part of my life’s mission. It will be a place to celebrate culture and diversity, science and technology, live in harmony with nature and each other, and bring prosperity and inspirations to the world around us. 💛\n\nNow building a village is not an easy task, many aspects need to be considered, land, governance, legal structure, revenue model… creating concept art and mission statement is only the first steps among many to follow.\n\n### To Be Continued…\n\nThank you all for reading through this journal about my creative expression. Many details aren’t included here, such as the extensive research about eco village and eco living, my journey through hippie gatherings, reading upon different school of philosophies from CG Jung to Taoism, and how they influenced my creative expressions and perspectives on life.", "timestamp": 1658197817, "digest": "2x13uGS8SnMndDAVq5_g8bdeJVbIQbXCPTQJ9xQQ2FY", "contributor": "0x79A99912f8890DB72EEF59dd92Baa0935D133856"}

{"id": "V2gp99jDw_dR-oIfmiSgaXtKmzngk8w4jWPjZRr2gkA", "title": "Research DAO 1.0", "body": "*Six months ago, I sought to understand blockchain’s potential as an internet-native platform for new social and financial structures. To continue learning, I am working with friends to launch The HiveMind - a community-run research DAO whose mission is to bring crypto use cases to light and fund projects demonstrating true utility via a grants program.*\n\n*Over time, the community will create a public library of content that will help our audience understand the true economic and social benefits of web3, DeFi, and the broader crypto ecosystem.*\n\n## The Crypto Community Needs To Do Better\n\nOver the past year, virtually everyone wanted exposure to BTC, ETH and maybe even a few altcoins. Yet, rather than accumulating these tokens and using them for their intended purposes, most simply wanted to speculate by holding them and hoping to double their investments in the short-term. Why?\n\nEffectively, the financial upside of crypto was mass marketed while crypto’s technical benefits - and what they can unlock for everyone - were much less discussed. As Balaji has [mentioned](https://balajis.com/mirrortable/) before, many debates surrounding web3 have operated at a 30,000 foot and 280 character level, without enough longer-form discussions about crypto’s true utility in layman’s terms.\n\nNow, as financial markets correct and [interest](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=crypto) from the broader population dies down, much of the excess liquidity that crypto markets absorbed over the past year has quickly left the ecosystem.\n\nWhile speculation isn't all bad and in effect acts as a [force](https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/) for technological development, I would argue that had more people better understood the benefits and potential of blockchain, then they might not have sold so quickly once the opportunity for short-term profits evaporated. There’s a reason why memes like these are pretty damn funny and get so much engagement.\n\n[https://twitter.com/turnernovak/status/1544504508713164802?s=21&t=B1GILrkRC2FVtGWPd3r_7Q](https://twitter.com/turnernovak/status/1544504508713164802?s=21&t=B1GILrkRC2FVtGWPd3r_7Q)\n\nOur goal with the first iteration of The HiveMind is clear - to evaluate and articulate both the current use cases and potential of crypto technology, so as to onboard more builders into the space and ignite a virtuous cycle of development that benefits everyone.\n\n## A Focused Mission to Assess, Evaluate and Index Crypto Use Cases\n\nIt is becoming more clear that crypto is money built natively for the internet age. If designed and executed well, this technology can enable more accessible financial networks with better incentives for everyone. But what exactly do these new networks look like? How do they benefit certain groups? Will there come a time where they benefit the general population? Where do they fall short?\n\nThe DAOs research will be focused on answering these questions. See the bottom of this essay for a list of some themes/use cases that are worth exploring in detail.\n\n## Season 1 of The Hive Mind\n\nIf others have learned anything with DAOs, it's that focus around one measurable objective leads to better chances of success. With that in mind, the DAOs first project will involve the production of 10 research and thought pieces that explore a core segment or theme within the crypto ecosystem. DAO members will be able to pair up or work individually to research and analyze a topic of interest.\n\nOnce published as NFTs via *Mirror* just like this essay, any content produced by the DAO will be auctioned off for proceeds and will become collectible by members of the broader crypto ecosystem. Then, any proceeds received from the sale of NFTs would be redistributed back to a community-controlled treasury that will be donated to a crypto project of choice demonstrating strong utility in the form of a grant.\n\nIt’s important to note that while our content will become collectible, the articles themselves will always be publicly accessible via the DAO’s page on *Mirror*. They’ll just be owned by supporters who wish to contribute to projects that demonstrate true utility.\n\n## Value Accretion to DAO Tokens\n\nUsing a valuation framework that [Jihad Esmail](https://twitter.com/jaesmail?s=20&t=wzbHzyXt95eF7mLEIbdUjw) explains in his latest [essay](https://forefront.market/blog/tokenized-communities-value) on tokenized communities, we can think of value being captured by the DAO’s native token in the following dimensions:\n\n**Production Value** - this layer captures any value generated by the products, services, and content that the community produces. By publishing articles that explore and assess current crypto use cases, and then listing them for sale as NFTs, any proceeds would flow back to a community-controlled treasury that will be allocated to a project of choice in the form of a grant.\n\n**Network Value** - this layer captures the value of belonging to a community with a shared mission or “meme”. The HiveMind DAO will be made up of students and young professionals who are determined to make a difference within the broader crypto ecosystem. By combining our knowledge, backgrounds, and networks, we are much stronger than the sum of our individual parts. That is the essence of a \"hive mind\".\n\n**Ownership Value** - finally, this layer captures the governance value of the DAO token. As genesis community members, we will all have an equal say in how the DAO treasury is allocated, and what future seasons of The Hive Mind look like.\n\nThese elements will comprise the total value of the community’s native token, for which each initial member will be allocated the same proportion.\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\nAt the end of the day, building useful products is the key to crypto’s widespread adoption. But in the background, there is a real need to discuss and evaluate what can be done with this new technology, so as to direct both social and financial capital to the right problems and solutions.\n\nOn an individual level, by creating content that explores crypto utility, you can play a significant role in onboarding the next users and builders to the ecosystem while also learning a great deal and connecting with others in the process. Aside from collaborating to generate this content, the DAO’s community should ideally serve as a sandbox to incubate ideas, get user feedback and generate alpha.\n\nIf you are interested in joining the research DAO, you can reach out via Twitter.\n\n## Q&A\n\n### What does the workflow look like for season 1 of the research DAO?\n\n![Workflow for season 1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oUFAnfcX1jU83GWjFsMew.png?height=1794&width=1270)\n\n### Do the tokens have a buy-in price?\n\nIn exchange for a fixed share of the DAOs tokens, members will invest $100. This shouldn’t necessarily be seen as an upfront “cost” to joining the DAO, as the funds will be pooled into a shared treasury that is owned and controlled by the community.\n\nAs much as the community's primary objective is to generate content that helps our audience understand crypto use cases, the longer-term vision for the DAO will ideally include an investing component. By starting with a very small treasury, the community can begin to understand what it is like to invest a shared treasury on-chain.\n\n### Who controls the DAOs treasury?\n\nThe community does. For changes to take place (making investments, incurring expenses, etc.), they must be pre-approved by a majority of DAO members.\n\n### What will the onboarding process look like for members?\n\nFor the first season of The HiveMind, membership will be limited to between 10-20 individuals. Rather than creating a waiting list and then onboarding everyone at the same time once the member threshold has been reached, we plan to onboard members gradually. Similar but not identical to what they are doing at [Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/), members will be onboarded gradually over several weeks.\n\n### How will the DAO treasury tokens be created and managed?\n\nThe DAO will rely on the [Syndicate Protocol](https://syndicate.io/), a DApp supporting the creation and management of investment clubs. Using the Syndicate platform, members will be able to contribute funds, and track the transactions that are executed by the DAO. Members will also be able to see the value of the DAO's treasury that is attributable to them.\n\n### What are some examples of topics that could be explored as part of season 1?\n\nHere’s a non-exhaustive list of some themes/use cases that are worth exploring in detail:\n\n* What does it truly mean for a network to be permissionless? Why does it matter?\n* What are tokens and why do some call them “equity 2.0”? Why should platform users care about tokens?\n* What are the downsides to a project issuing tokens early on? How can they be mitigated? How could this affect users?\n* What happened during the ICO boom in 2018? Was the recent NFT boom much different? How can we do better?\n* What are ZK proofs? How do they help scale blockchains and speed up the adoption of on-chain credentials?\n* How can on-chain credentials / soulbound tokens unlock new opportunities for users to participate in an open internet economy?\n* How are web3 marketplaces different from their web2 counterparts?\n* Are DAOs really the future of remote work? What have been the most successful applications of DAOs so far?\n* Why should we care about DeFi? How is DeFi different from CeFi? How exactly can you earn yield in DeFi?\n* What even is DeSci? How can it democratize and improve access to scientific research and content?", "timestamp": 1658197728, "digest": "zISvt8Nu_KhpGRnVURWX9cSsIs_7cPA6nzP_XOc0rV0", "contributor": "0xEe38E983D827183266AD3E455e7e4747D91e7237"}
{"id": "WP-aLxqrSnZ5n_soOFid1IP_sC9pqnscsM9PuUIb0ds", "title": "Notes v1.1 July 11-July 18", "body": "I want to start publishing some of the notes from podcasts/articles that I take. I’ll try and make it a weekly thing. This week will have notes from before as well.\n\n## Sam Kazemian on Market Capping\n\n### Fun Fact\n\nFRAX logo/symbol is the unspecified general currency sign - when internet came out they had a placeholder for general currency symbol, for what they thought would be the general internet currency symbol.\n\n### FRAX, Curve & FraxBasePool\n\n* Frax started out of the concept that if you have a protocol that controls its own liquidity and collateral like, you can deploy it into AMM's and the protocol itself can earn yield and transaction fees.\n* Before, instead everybody just rented liquidity and paid their governance token to rent liquidity inside of these AMMs/DEX's.\n* Curve AMO that Frax developed, (which is just a smart contract that sends collateral and extra FRAX into FRAX's curve pool), essentially allows Frax to become largest TVL and controllers of liquidity on Curve.\n* Obviously 4pool won't be happening anymore. Frax went back to drawing board to implement/create a similar system, that can be done risk-free: a FraxBasePool where Frax can allow other projects to pair with FRAX liquidity.\n* FraxBasePool: Just FRAX-USDC (least risky because USDC is basically tokenized treasuries).\n  * Any project that pairs with FRAX base pool will proportionally get incentivized by demand they create.\n  * When projects use 3pool, they have to basically rent liquidity and subsidize USDC-DAI-USDT.\n  * FraxBasePool you pair with FRAX-USDC, Frax doesn't keep what you help grow, doesn't keep CRV-CVX, they channel it back to you.\n  * Instead they build a network effect around the FraxBasePool as a Schelling point for liquidity, and give back proportional to demand for FBP by protocol.\n  * LPs earn yield just by using FraxBasePool, Frax not involved with other stablecoins, so no esoteric risk coming from other stables - only FRAX-USDC risk.\n* Timeline of FraxBasePool:\n  * Sam's been talking to Mitch (founder of Curve).\n  * Curve needs to deploy the FraxBasePool themselves.\n  * After team deploys, CurveDAO vote will allow FraxBasePool up as other option (aside from 3Pool).\n  * Second part of proposal is about whitelisting veCRV.\n  * Whitelisting will let Frax to permanently lock all FraxBasePool earnings that the protocol earns from its collateral and expansions (that don't go to other protocols as yield).\n  * Through this Frax can permanently vote FBP for the gauge weight etc. The more Frax can earn the more they can distribute to other protocols that pair.\n  * No more dumping CRV from FRAX - good for CVX and CRV since less sell pressure.\n* FRAX has good volume but not much velocity of money - to fix that they want to be a central liquidity locust, through FraxBasePool. FRAX will become high volume, high turnover money.\n* FRAX has historically been a good savings stablecoin, good yields, stable peg and has been lindy - doesn't have much velocity - which FraxBasePool and FraxLending will improve.\n\n### AMOs, Collateral Ratio, Decentralization Ratio & Doomsday Situation\n\n**AMOs**\n\n* When people mint FRAX into the new base pool/or put FRAX in there, they have to use USDC to mint that FRAX. That USDC comes into the Frax protocol. Frax takes that USDC and puts it into the AMOs.\n* The other direction can also happen. AMOs can mint and burn FRAX and move collateral (USDC). Someone can buy FRAX from Curve pool until curve pool is imbalanced then AMO can mint FRAX to balance it 50/50 and get LP tokens.\n\n**Collateral Ratio**\n\n* Collateral ratio is entirely backed by hard assets. Rest is FXS and other assets that aren't immediately liquid like vlCVX.\n* FRAX has a lot of locked liquidity in a lot of different places. If you take a deterministic analysis by looking at entire landscape of user owned FRAX and protocol owned FRAX you see that there cannot be a bank run right now.\n* Collateral ratio shows amount of FRAX backed by USDC (hard assets). Rest is backed by FXS and other volatile assets vlcvx.  One of the things in times of liquidity crisis/bank runs etc. if you take a full look at entire landscape of user owned frax etc.\n\n**Decentralization Ratio**\n\n* Decentralization ratio is amount of FRAX backed by completely non-custodial assets: non-fiat coins, not wBTC etc.\n* If FRAX is backed partially by DAI - DAI itself is 65% centralized assets. The ratio only counts decentralized version of DAI (because underlying DAI has claims on USDC etc.)\n\n**Doomsday situation**\n\n* If you simulate everything, FRAX is entirely deterministic, no Jump, no market makers, no collateral off-chain, what you see is what you get - everything is on-chain.\n* What if every single person farming FRAX pulled their Curve LP and dumped?\n* Currently it will not depeg. This is because there's a lot of locked liquidity and a lot of protocol owned liquidity.\n* Future depends on locked liquidity, how much debt denomination it has etc.\n\n### TradFi & Legislations\n\n* Sam thinks recent bill is bullish.\n\n**FRAX vs USDC, VISA et al.**\n\n* Its outside of FRAX's scope to try and do things off-chain.\n  * Doesn't want to incorporate a company and hold treasuries with Frax etc.\n* There will always be use for USDC or if Visa came out with a stablecoin or something. (something like BridgeFi)\n* But USDC will not build AMOs or AMM primitives like TWAMM etc. to integrate liquidity into protocols etc. They will be specialized for the requirement to hold treasuries and etc.\n* FRAX will be specialized to be the  predominant on-chain stablecoin, for everything on-chain.\n* Symbiotic relationship between USDC with Frax and Maker. It's not in Circle and Visa's wheelhouse to do certain stuff.\n* What if government says USDC must blacklist everything unless KYC?\n  * FRAX doesn't hold USDC it deploys it immediately into curve etc. USDC has to literally blacklist everything Curve Uniswap, Compound, AAVE etc.\n  * Sam doesn't think it's going in that direction. If it does go in that direction, to get to FRAX and Maker is to nuke everything - at that point they have bigger problems to worry about.\n* One of the biggest things was the surprising stance on stablecoins they want to keep a bit decentralized stablecoins, helps FRAX and DAI and FEI.\n* What FRAX is building is hard to replicate. Money is the strongest network effect. The more debt denominated/the more liquidity/the more others hold it which makes it harder to dislodge and coordinating a large group to hold it, creates the mother of all network effects.\n\n### FXS, Fraxswap and FraxLend\n\n**FXS**\n\n* FRAX - FXS is not just a mint and burn system.\n* The protocol earns a lot of revenue in CRV, CVX, soon from interest rates from FraxLend etc. and a lot of transaction fees.\n* Frax can buy back FXS if it's the best thing to do, if they know the governance token is highly undervalued compared to other assets on the balance sheet. Possibly buy back through TWAMM.\n\n**Fraxswap**\n\n* New UI, live on preview subdomains\n* Big vision and why they're actually building an AMM and a lending protocol around FXS:\n  * The way they look at it is that they have the concept of trinity:\n  * Every DeFi ecosystem/economy are formed of different flavours of lending, liquidity and currency, which means stablecoins, AMM and lending market.\n  * Many projects build stuff internally but don't go final 10% and make it a general infrastructural product. (i.e. projects already have a form of swap, but do not have a self-serve AMM that people can actually use and which will bring liquidity.)\n* FRAX wants to build this ecosystem strategically:\n  * If they're gonna spend weeks to create something that would allow them buy back FXS or contract supply of FRAX or rebalance collateral, they want to take a professional approach and build a new primitive.\n  * They're building a new AMM (with TWAMM functionality) called Fraxswap to purchase back FXS with protocol profit to be able to contract supply of FRAX, rebalance collateral etc.\n* You can TWAMM into any coin, not just FXS - you can create any pool against FXS. You don't have to create a FRAX pair. You can use any ERC-20 token.\n* TWAMM: User sets time period, every block during this period the user buys a small amount - essentially DCAing, buying small amounts over a period of time.\n* Fraxswap has a fee switch/admin switch that will distribute value to FXS holders.\n* How to bring liquidity into Fraxswap/TWAMM:\n  * TWAMM functionality will cater to large protocol owned liquidity.\n  * Additionally FXS gauges will be used. Anybody that uses Fraxswap for treasury rebalancing etc. they will get FXS gauges.\n  * How will they incentivize gauges?\n    * They will use redacted, pitch.money and votium in the future to earn bribes/incentives.\n* Sam doesn't want to be zero-sum competitors with Curve, they will still deploy largely to Curve. He thinks Fraxswap will be used for volatile pairs for protocols themselves that need to deploy liquidity and rebalance stuff.\n* Future Features:\n  * Through TWAMM, protocols can protect liquid backing by always slowly buying back into until price hits x over next y years and they get to buy low to get to a certain price.\n  * Custom curves. Currently Fraxswap is just regular xy=k curve but with TWAMMs. They're working on custom curves, concentrated liquidity and other unique projects.\n\n**Fraxlend**\n\n* Allows creation of isolated pairs with infinite customizability\n* Fully permissionless\n* Credit-based LTVs: You can create a pair where only whitelisted address of a DAO or individual (e.g. Tetranode) can borrow, and you can modify LTV for that specific pair.\n* It is essentially an entire framework for creating lending systems\n* Same idea of building strategically. You can mint FRAX on Fraxlend, loop and lend it back etc. Can essentially get leverage just like people were able to do with MIM.\n* Why are they doing so much?\n  * They are working/concentrating on FRAX, trying to build a professional and decentralized software, that allows more functionality - as opposed to building a limited/one-dimensional product.\n* Yields generated from Fraxlend would go to FXS holders.\n\n### Ecosystem, Keeping Up With Narratives, FPI & Long Term Vision\n\n**Ecosystem**\n\n* What do you want next for the Frax ecosystem?\n  * The more people build on the gauge ecosystem, the more vibrant the teams building on top of it, with primitives on top of base primitives etc.\n  * Frax's gauges are unique because people can lock the actual LP deposit for a period of time to get an extra boost. This is an anti-reflexive/anti-bank run product as liquidity is locked\n  * Through Stax, Temple will take LP and lock for 3 years, tokenize the position and you can exit your locked tokenized position, while the liquidity is still locked, acting as an anti-reflexive/anti-bank run product.\n\nThe system of locking LP tokens for increased boost is part of design. To kick start an algorithmic stablecoin it is important to have an anti-reflexive/anti-bank run product.\n\\- You can only build this type of product on top of Frax currently, and Temple built a platform on top of this system.\n\nCould Convex do a similar Stax system:\n\\- If Stax becomes the second Convex for Frax, then Convex might adopt their system.\n\n**Keeping Up With Narratives**\n\n* Inside in crypto more than he sees sunlight, around the clock sitting here reading about stuff.\n* If he sees something new, what is it, is it new or fork/improvement?\n* If new is team doing it are they understanding intricacies?\n  * If yes he wants to talk to them and see if he can get involved\n* See where industry is going rather than following right now\n\n**FPI and Yields**\n\n* Frax cannot do something like Anchor etc. so they need to find sustainable, highest growth and attempt to join into new things at the base/start.\n* FPI is the second stablecoin, it's pegged to the CPI. It is an inflation resistant dollar. Grows and tracks the CPI.\n  * FRAX/FPI LP on Convex to earn FXS, Curve vAPY, CRV, CVX as well as FPI yields.\n* What do you mint against FPI:\n  * FPI protocol needs to grow backing at inflation rate or more.\n  * When Fraxlend comes out, users can borrow against FPI or borrow FPI, which will go towards the FPI balance sheet, keeping it collateralized.\n\n**Long Term Vision of FRAX**\n\n* Sam wants to build a full stack/complete economy around FRAX and the new FPI:\n  * Complete economy: lending, liquidity and currency - (stablecoins, AMM and lending market and debt denomination)\n* After a full stack economy is built, then they can think about a potential Frax Roll Up - to capture value of the block space and etc.\n* Unlike Terra they want to build economy first and then build a roll-up, not start as an L1.\n* If block space is valuable enough for people to pay fees, \"months and months from now\", might end up with own Frax Chain or Roll-Up.\n\n## Sam Kazemian on The Defiant\n\n### Current Situation:\n\n* Tough macroeconomic situation.\n* Confidence of stablecoins down and FRAX only 17 months old so relatively new.\n* With stablecoins it's difficult because essentially you spend all your time stabilizing a token to a dollar, just so that it works every time people need to flee to stablecoins\n* They're trying to develop Lindy effects to make sure that they have a stablecoin that is actually being used when there's a flight to safety\n* Proud that FRAX kept peg when everything was de-pegged - happy to be able to develop confidence and Lindy effect similar to DAI and USDC\n\n### Lindy Effect:\n\n* Resilience of protocol acquired over time\n* Why does Sam care about Lindy Effect much?\n* Lindy Effect is social phenomenon that longer something is around, the higher the chance it sticks around\n* Lindy Effect in stablecoins is much longer\n* Longer stablecoin stays at peg, the longer people will think it will survive, which is why it's particularly important for stablecoins.\n\n### How to build Lindy Effect:\n\n* FRAX and DAI or Maker have no competition/issues. FRAX wants sustainable and developing yield, and Maker is not interested in that - one is not necessarily better than the other.\n* Sam wants deep liquidity, use for sustainable LP'ing and staking in Curve.\n  Thinks UST wanted to be similar to FRAX, a fractional algorithmic currency, because it's a more resilient model\n  Terra wanted to be more like FRAX but they never managed to get their collateral ratio high enough\n\n### Depegging and Collateralization:\n\n* Stablecoins need a lot of exogenous collateral\n  FRAX is highly collateralized, and people say isn't that like a fully backed stablecoin\n  FRAx needs to be highly collateralized since it is quite young, it should be 90% backed, it cannot be a fiat like currency yet, it's only 17 months old.\n  That's why they have been trying to be similar to DAI, to have lots of hard-backed collateral, to lower bank-run chances and reflexivity\n* The only similarity FRAX currently has to algorithmic stablecoins is the name, right now it's not necessarily algorithmic\n* FRAX kind of passed the test of terrible market conditions.\n\n### Full Stack Economy:\n\n* They want to constantly improve, it will never be a finished product\n* They've been building 24/7, they want to build the FRAX full stack economy.\n  A full permissionless economy, with TWAMM and FRAXSwap\n  TWAMM - a good system for protocol owned liquidity: allows balancing large amounts of collateral and making large market orders\n  Can also be used like Uniswap V2.\n* Essentially building a full economy around FRAX and using FXS, not a random bunch of tokens.\n  Want to create liquidity and capture value, debt denominated in your own infrastructure, like Maker and CDP and DAI\n  Full DeFi stack\n  Lending, liquidity and currency\n  When things are good, traditionally stablecoins don't have much velocity and have low fees\n  Which is why they need to find ways to generate velocity and fees\n* Use cases of money: store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange\n  * FRAX has been a good store of value, but they want to have more trading pairs and debt denominated in it (loans), to make sure that they satisfy all use cases of money - to capture value.\n\n### Buyback and UST Aftermath:\n\n* They make 80 million dollars in annual revenue, they want to buy back 20 million of FXS using TWAMM.\n* They are proposing it now, because FXS has been hit hard, harder than most bc of stablecoin confidence.\n* FXS lost a lot of value, not just because of market conditions, but also because of general distrust of stablecoins after UST depeg/Luna disaster.\n* It's not always good to buyback and burn governance token, you want to increase balance sheet, put it towards growth etc.\n* However, if the market misprices (according to us), the token and is undervalued, compared to other tokens that could be bought and put on the balance sheet.\n* Logically, the most useful thing to do is buyback and retire the governance tokens. They think that FXS is undervalued, and it's the best use of protocol profits. FXS dropped 38 ATH to 6.38. FRAX is creating revenue, it's a resilient protocol, going to have more rev bc of swap and lending.\n\n### Marketing and FRAX:\n\n* How has FRAX decided to talk to Yellen and convince about FRAX.\n* They have different ethos for marketing: everything is provable on-chain: FRAX team is just 8 to 9 engineers, no marketing team, DeFi focused. There's a lot of FUD, they're not interested on twitter and don't want to convince to be believed, they're on chain and transparent\n* They have shown that they are protected from a bank run because of amount of liquidity and locked liquidity and integrations FRAX wouldn't depeg due to current collateral ratio, they can see, everyone can see because we're on chain and transparent. Maybe we made a mistake go verify it.\n* 46 million FRAX can still be printed and expanded and would still be impossible to bank run. They run internal tests and are meticulous about keeping it all on-chain, no CEX and market maker relationships - just like Maker. Everything is in smart contracts, there marketing is the tech and keep it on-chain.\n\n### Fraxswap and Curve Competition:\n\n* One of the biggest proposals recently is the FraxBasePool:\n  Closest thing to risk-free, because it's with USDC\n  They will essentially own part of Curve as they grow with it. They want to become their meta stable coin, since Curve cannot issue their own stablecoin.\n  They're collaborative, they just want to grow the whole DeFi pie, no competition, no value lost, gain value from both of them.\n\n### Basket of assets that back the stablecoin:\n\n* Some curve LP tokens lower volatility, some WBTC and ETH\n  They're looking to increase volatile assets that back FRAX, especially during bear market where prices are down. Good time to increase with profits and not with seigniorage to not take asymmetric risks), to create a resilient and strong peg.\n* Increasing ETH exposure/backing would also allow FRAX to expand the ability for Frax PoS staking service, a Frax ETH derivative of sorts like Lido.\n  It makes sense to have Frax have the ability to have proof of stake validator infrastructure issue 1:1 FRAX/ETH derivative that can back FRAX. Essentially create more value.\n\n### Future:\n\n* Sam has been in the industry 7-8 years. They don't do stuff for the fun of it, they want to consider what will stuff look like in a year? How to get their incrementally?\n* The staked Lido type system not for profit, they're building full stack economy: \n* If they're gonna have liquidity, lending and currency, the last part of that is the actual network, the blockspace, to own a piece of the blockchain, and participate. \n* To make the FRAX economy the largest consensus forming Schelling points, to capture the value of those transaction fees. \n\n### Real World Assets:\n\n* Terrible time to take real world risks, but good time to build relationships and infrastructure when things turn around\n* They're currently working with goldfinch etc. to talk about how they can do real world lending through them, but market conditions are not great.\n* They agree with Maker guys on real world assets:\n  If you're going to have debt denominated in your stablecoin, you need the actual stablecoin to issue credit and debt for actual economic activity, not just degenerate behaviour.\n  There's actually a real use case for DeFi, if FRAX and Maker will ever scale to trillion dollars of supply, there has to be real economic lending in the real world.\n  Hopefully will become a less risky endeavour in a better market value\n\n### Algorithmic Stablecoin Definition and Current Prognosis for USD:\n\nThe outdated algorithmic stablecoin old system doesn't work.\nVolatile governance token being used to stabilize the other token created out of thin air doesn't work.\nFRAX premise was just that: it doesn't work, we need exogenous collateral, only small amounts of algorithmic.\nThey need to build Lindy and almost entirety of it needs to be backed by assets.\n\n### Whats Sam's prognosis for USD?\n\n```\nUSD doesn't look great.\nWhat FRAX is working on is the FPI. \n\tPegged to the CPI, inflation resistant dollar. \n\tCurrent unit of account of world is USD, 80%+ trade is denominated in it. \n\tWhatever will be successor has to be self-sovereign peg or some other stablecoin that has a stability to a basket of assets humans care about.\n\tThree trillion dollar narratives: BTC, ETH and Stablecoins.\n```", "timestamp": 1658197679, "digest": "HQRIkEe6j3X5QGiJF5U0HkDO7NAu4MGGkIK-Rl-IgD4", "contributor": "0xfF8Fa9737169903FEb053d6320d7088cF6EC861B"}

My real father left my mother when she was pregnant with me in early 1992. So I grew up never knowing him, or my grandparents for that matter. Instead my stepfather would raise me like one his own four children he had with my mother. They would also become my stepbrothers and stepsisters who would make up our family of seven, me being the oldest. \n\n![My first job and my first business card ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KysY3yY1sBL3nv-kXZWkC.jpeg?height=554&width=378)\n\nWhen I was a freshman at Osborne High School in Marietta, Georgia, my stepfather got deported after being pulled over while on his way to his job as a pallet builder and recycler.

On top of completing a high school education, I now had to look for a full-time job to support my younger siblings (2 brother and 2 sisters) and my mother who couldn’t work. \n\nFortunately, my mother’s brother had heard about the incident, and helped us relocate to Garland, Texas into a small 2 bedroom apartment. \n\n## Dropping out \n\n![October 2015 the night I met then unknown Sam Kazemian and Mahbod Moghadam who would become my mentor for the next 4 years ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GiCgQj0vPg1Opx0fGgDrl.jpeg?height=850&width=1280)\n\nI’ll never forget the night I first met Sam Kazemian and the rap genius. \n\n## Startup life \n\n![Sam Kazemian, me, and our former mentor (January 2016) ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PaqsekhSdZ8N3OwbIydpN.jpeg?height=1124&width=1126)\n\nLife was amazing.

{"id": "pL8jm6pFdLMxZobD7vEYUuuhGslATHBiUBXqB4Rxisw", "title": "Meet life's challenges with confidence", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0QcK6boUzvUcwo9kIRInI.png?height=1600&width=899)\n\nEach of the more than 300 stories in this book contains profound truths that taught me to love others and to face life’s challenges with confidence. When I face setbacks and disappointments, it will give me encouragement and comfort; when I face success, it will give me hope for the future. It will be a good teacher and friend in my life forever.\n\nIn this book, what impressed me the most was the story in volume seven: the feeling of wild geese. The story is about a flock of geese helping each other and flying south. Along the way, they encountered many difficulties, but they worked together and with the help of the team, they finally successfully reached the south. One of Blake's words in this story vividly reminds me: \"No bird will rise too high if it only uses its own wings to fly.\" Only when people help each other can they achieve greater success. The power of a team is powerful, and if a person is separated from the team, he must not be able to get enough help to be successful. Remember, it's always those who know how to help each other because they have a greater advantage. I remember someone saying: \"You have an apple, I have an apple, and the two of us are still one apple after the exchange; but you have one thought, I have one thought, and we both have two thoughts after the exchange. \"Because of this, a united collective can always outperform a single person.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sn2Vn1gxKTQeQUIfb3USw.png?height=833&width=500)\n\nThree stooges outperformed one Zhuge Liang. People who share a common purpose and sense of community can get where they want to go faster and easier because they are driven by each other's drive and support. Various examples in life prove this. In scientific research, many people who have succeeded in research are actually standing behind some people who have helped them a lot. Take the people who won the Nobel Prize. After winning the award, they always thank someone for their great help during this period. Without these people, he may never have been able to invent and create. It is because of the help of these people that he can go to success without worry.\n\nBecause of love, people can interact with each other and maintain the harmony of interpersonal relationships. In the real society that emphasizes utilitarianism, there are still many volunteers who give silently. They go to the hospital to take care of the patients, go to the labor camp to care for the lonely old uncles and old women, and bring them happy times... and many other things that are enthusiastic about service, these unknown The volunteers don't hesitate to sacrifice their rest time, but also contribute a little caring spirit to the society. It is really worth applauding them. \"It is more blessed to give than to receive\". Many people don't understand the true meaning of this sentence and question it. They think it should be \"blessed to receive is more blessed than to give.\" True happiness, a feeling of contentment and calmness. In the article \"Saving the Starfish\", some people have doubts: there are thousands of starfish on the beach, like stars in the sky, and this does not change anything. He smiled, still bent down and picked up another starfish again. When he threw the starfish into the sea, he murmured, \"The fate of another starfish has been changed.\" It seems very small under the environment, but it still has its power and effect, just like \"the fate of a starfish has changed again.\" The meaning of this sentence is the same, a person's power is very small, but if you can push yourself and others, everyone The love you exert will be immeasurable, so don't underestimate your contribution. Everyone has the right and ability to give care. As long as they are willing to give true love, even a caring look, a bright smile, and a warm hug will make those who approach you feel like a spring breeze, and the world around them will also So brighter, so don't ignore the power of love as it can sometimes change a person's future.\n\nIn the world, everyone is a unique individual with different connotations and characteristics, and their own growth environment and background are also different. Even though twins look alike and have the same living conditions, they are still different individuals with different life experiences and leisure interests, so why should we force ourselves to be the same as others? Don't blindly imitate others, fearing that you will be outdated, so quickly follow the example and become popular with everyone. Especially in our Chinese people, what is popular in Japan, and soon a swarm of people followed in their footsteps, such as: electronic pets, Pikachu, scooters, etc., and gradually formed the \"Hari trend\" and \"Hari tribe\" situation. The reason why people are valuable lies in being able to control themselves, to love oneself is to be able to deeply understand oneself, to know oneself, to accept everything about oneself, to have one's own personality in every word and deed, to be one's own master, to recognize oneself, to affirm oneself, and to live a down-to-earth life. From me, that's the most important thing.\n\nHow to raise a child is a test for parents, especially in today's society, the number of children is small, so some parents dote on their children in every possible way, and they are reluctant to blame them for wrongdoing. The child has really committed a heinous crime, and it is too late to regret it. In fact, the real culprit behind it is the parents. The main reason why there are so many delinquent teenagers who are causing trouble is the improper discipline of their parents. Relying on sticks to raise children is ineffective now. \"Water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it.\" Opportunity education is very important when a child does something wrong, so how to discipline a child depends on the wisdom of the parents. \"Children who are accused of middle-aged and grown-up will be more likely to blame others in the future, and children who have grown up with hostility will be more likely to be aggressive and brave in the future...\" The content of the article \"This Is What Kind of Environment Do You Give Your Children\", so we know the children's The growth environment is very important, which may affect his future personality, conduct...etc. This is the main reason why Meng's mother moved three times. The environment is important, but parents should also set an example and lead by example in everything.\n\nPeople should learn all their lives, especially in the era of knowledge explosion, and they should constantly enrich themselves. Technology is developing and progressing, and various things are changing. Only by learning various things can we survive in a diversified society. . Knowledge is power, it can make one have good judgment, distinguish right from wrong, and have better processing ability. Although the founding father was in exile during his lifetime, he still did not forget to read when he was financially strapped. \"If you don't come back in the prime of life, it's hard to come again in the morning. You should be encouraged in time, and time waits for no one.\" Advise people to work hard in time and not let down the good times. \"Learning without thinking is worthless, and thinking without learning is perilous.\" It is emphasized that both learning and thinking should be emphasized, and more thinking should be done in addition to learning, and the direction of thinking should not be in a straight line. This one gets more wisdom and experience. Students should learn only if they don’t understand. They should imitate the spirit of Confucius, and they should not be ashamed to ask questions that they do not know. Spirit is really worthy of our study, and only by upholding this belief can we learn more and for a longer period of time. \"\n\nOf course, \"Chicken Soup for the Soul\" helped me far more than that. It also taught me how to love others, how to learn, how to achieve dreams, how to overcome obstacles, how to face death and so on. Thanks to Chicken Soup for the Soul for helping me, I will always remember everything Chicken Soup for the Soul taught me.", "timestamp": 1658197990, "digest": "sIlXV4mhlXMZ8VqeBirb2Mqg6-uyWPe40TMbMSVH_z8", "contributor": "0x0E2Dcd6E8f0F7843b544041546b8c6e85EFd71C2"}

The liquidators [said](https://3acliquidation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/20220709-3AC-BVI-Liquidation-Recognition-1st-Affidavit-of-Russell-Crumpler-Filed.pdf) in the 1,157-page document that a court decision is needed in light of the number legal proceedings that may arise in the near future and the “virtual radio silence from the management/directors of the Company.”\n\nAccording to the July 9 application, the Singapore office may contain cold wallets or information on how to access 3AC trading accounts, which [the liquidators want to access](https://cointelegraph.com/news/liquidators-can-subpoena-3ac-founders-despite-tricky-issues-with-crypto-assets) before any of it is removed or destroyed. The application lists previous unsuccessful efforts to obtain information from company directors Su Zhu and Kyle Davies and their representatives.\n\nDetails of 3AC’s financial woes continue to emerge. According to The Street, 3AC’s biggest creditor, trader Genesis Asia Pacific, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, loaned 3AC $2.36 billion.\n\nThat [is a far greater sum](https://cointelegraph.com/news/contagion-genesis-faces-huge-losses-blockfi-s-1b-loan-celsius-s-risky-model) than previously reported.

Until one day, the bird met my heart and sparked a brilliant spark...\n\n\"Flying Birds\" is written by the Indian poet Tagore. Reading his poems, I felt a kind of detachment reborn in the mundane world, and I was glad that I found a corner of tranquility in the noisy city. What the birds brought to me is a baptism of the soul, a kind of wisdom intertwined with love and beauty, and a real and fresh and beautiful dream.\n\nWhen the birds met my heart, I learned to love. Loving yourself is the premise of all love.\n\n\"I have been hurt, I have been disappointed, I have experienced 'death', I am very happy to live in this great world.\" Who has never been troubled? However, in the loss and pain, Tagore chose to love and love himself s life……\n\nYears pushes me to the distant embankment like a tide. I know that one day, I will grow old little by little, so I cherish life more and more. It was the birds that made me understand that \"love is a fulfilling life, just like a wine glass full of wine,\" and then I realized that in every corner, there is love, beauty, and ordinary moving. When trouble comes, take it lightly and lightly, and everything will be fine. Why do you stubbornly sink yourself into \"suffering\"? The wind doesn't move, the flag doesn't move, whether it's beautiful or ugly, being alive is a kind of happiness, so why bother yourself.\n\nWhen birds touch my heart, I learn to love. Loving others is the continuation of happiness.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2kWckVPFzTGuTYynQyEo9.png?height=1024&width=768)\n\nI like the big tree in \"Asuka\" because, \"The woodcutter begged the tree with an axe for the handle. The tree gave him.\" The clouds are clothed with gorgeous clothes.\" I praise the soil in \"Flying Birds\", because \"the soil has been insulted by people, but it is rewarded with flowers.\" All this is love, love for others. It's so selfless, yet so real.\n\nFame and wealth seem to occupy more and more proportions in this world. It is no wonder that Tagore brought us these three hundred fresh poems, which gave us a light in the crowded days. It is because of his flying birds that I admire the tree, sing praises to the sun, and identify with the soil. Every time there is more love between people, the distance between hearts gets closer. Love yourself. And push the lover, so that the world is full of love. I think someday when I'm getting old, I'll be proud to say, \"I used to love.\"\n\nWhen the birds tap on my heartstrings, I learn to love. Loving the world is the highest point of happiness.\n\n\"I live in this world because I love this world.\" Fraternity is a kind of spiritual sustenance. With such a spiritual support, \"when you have no appetite\", you will not complain about food. The world is lovely. When we are disappointed, please don't complain, please learn to be tolerant and try to kiss our world with your heart.\n\nTagore's love rippled like waves, spreading all over the world. \"My mind shines with these shining green leaves, and my heart sings with the touch of the sun; my life rejoices to swim with all things in the blue of space and the black of time.\" , Sunshine, all things of life, have created a world that is indescribably beautiful for us; Tagore and birds remind us of happiness and sing praises of beauty, what reason do we have not to love life and the world.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/33-52bEjdVzW_u4qGurDI.png?height=728&width=640)\n\nThe troubles of life cannot drown out my pursuit of love; the noise of the city cannot drown out my praise for love. The vicissitudes of years may devour my youth, but the love in my heart will never grow old. As the closing line of \"Flying Birds\": \"I believe in your love.\"\n\n\"There are no traces left in the sky, but I have already flown.\" I would also like to be a flying bird that comes and goes without a trace, not asking for my influence here, but only asking for my love to leave me behind The breath of growth.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bDP4RepPDio3YW_OlSDPc.png?height=1308&width=736)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658198307, "digest": "X4GeagSbGqiQJvKZbnK1HBtPcZiqGHRM0Kel2ANHw9o", "contributor": "0x0E2Dcd6E8f0F7843b544041546b8c6e85EFd71C2"}

Hopefully will be able to make it a weekly thing.\n\n## Sam Kazemian on Market Capping\n\n### Fun Fact\n\nFRAX logo/symbol is the unspecified general currency sign - when internet came out they had a placeholder for general currency symbol, for what they thought would be the general internet currency symbol.\n\n### FRAX, Curve & FraxBasePool\n\n* Frax started out of the concept that if you have a protocol that controls its own liquidity and collateral like, you can deploy it into AMM's and the protocol itself can earn yield and transaction fees.\n* Before, instead everybody just rented liquidity and paid their governance token to rent liquidity inside of these AMMs/DEX's.\n* Curve AMO that Frax developed, (which is just a smart contract that sends collateral and extra FRAX into FRAX's curve pool), essentially allows Frax to become largest TVL and controllers of liquidity on Curve.\n* Obviously 4pool won't be happening anymore. Frax went back to drawing board to implement/create a similar system, that can be done risk-free: a FraxBasePool where Frax can allow other projects to pair with FRAX liquidity.\n* FraxBasePool: Just FRAX-USDC (least risky because USDC is basically tokenized treasuries).\n  * Any project that pairs with FRAX base pool will proportionally get incentivized by demand they create.\n  * When projects use 3pool, they have to basically rent liquidity and subsidize USDC-DAI-USDT.\n  * FraxBasePool you pair with FRAX-USDC, Frax doesn't keep what you help grow, doesn't keep CRV-CVX, they channel it back to you.\n  * Instead they build a network effect around the FraxBasePool as a Schelling point for liquidity, and give back proportional to demand for FBP by protocol.\n  * LPs earn yield just by using FraxBasePool, Frax not involved with other stablecoins, so no esoteric risk coming from other stables - only FRAX-USDC risk.\n* Timeline of FraxBasePool:\n  * Sam's been talking to Mitch (founder of Curve).\n  * Curve needs to deploy the FraxBasePool themselves.\n  * After team deploys, CurveDAO vote will allow FraxBasePool up as other option (aside from 3Pool).\n  * Second part of proposal is about whitelisting veCRV.\n  * Whitelisting will let Frax to permanently lock all FraxBasePool earnings that the protocol earns from its collateral and expansions (that don't go to other protocols as yield).\n  * Through this Frax can permanently vote FBP for the gauge weight etc. The more Frax can earn the more they can distribute to other protocols that pair.\n  * No more dumping CRV from FRAX - good for CVX and CRV since less sell pressure.\n* FRAX has good volume but not much velocity of money - to fix that they want to be a central liquidity locust, through FraxBasePool. FRAX will become high volume, high turnover money.\n* FRAX has historically been a good savings stablecoin, good yields, stable peg and has been lindy - doesn't have much velocity - which FraxBasePool and FraxLending will improve.\n\n### AMOs, Collateral Ratio, Decentralization Ratio & Doomsday Situation\n\n**AMOs**\n\n* When people mint FRAX into the new base pool/or put FRAX in there, they have to use USDC to mint that FRAX. That USDC comes into the Frax protocol. Frax takes that USDC and puts it into the AMOs.\n* The other direction can also happen. AMOs can mint and burn FRAX and move collateral (USDC). Someone can buy FRAX from Curve pool until curve pool is imbalanced then AMO can mint FRAX to balance it 50/50 and get LP tokens.\n\n**Collateral Ratio**\n\n* Collateral ratio is entirely backed by hard assets. Rest is FXS and other assets that aren't immediately liquid like vlCVX.\n* FRAX has a lot of locked liquidity in a lot of different places. If you take a deterministic analysis by looking at entire landscape of user owned FRAX and protocol owned FRAX you see that there cannot be a bank run right now.\n* Collateral ratio shows amount of FRAX backed by USDC (hard assets). Rest is backed by FXS and other volatile assets vlcvx.  One of the things in times of liquidity crisis/bank runs etc. if you take a full look at entire landscape of user owned frax etc.\n\n**Decentralization Ratio**\n\n* Decentralization ratio is amount of FRAX backed by completely non-custodial assets: non-fiat coins, not wBTC etc.\n* If FRAX is backed partially by DAI - DAI itself is 65% centralized assets. The ratio only counts decentralized version of DAI (because underlying DAI has claims on USDC etc.)\n\n**Doomsday situation**\n\n* If you simulate everything, FRAX is entirely deterministic, no Jump, no market makers, no collateral off-chain, what you see is what you get - everything is on-chain.\n* What if every single person farming FRAX pulled their Curve LP and dumped?\n* Currently it will not depeg. This is because there's a lot of locked liquidity and a lot of protocol owned liquidity.\n* Future depends on locked liquidity, how much debt denomination it has etc.\n\n### TradFi & Legislations\n\n* Sam thinks recent bill is bullish.\n\n**FRAX vs USDC, VISA et al.**\n\n* Its outside of FRAX's scope to try and do things off-chain.\n  * Doesn't want to incorporate a company and hold treasuries with Frax etc.\n* There will always be use for USDC or if Visa came out with a stablecoin or something. (something like BridgeFi)\n* But USDC will not build AMOs or AMM primitives like TWAMM etc. to integrate liquidity into protocols etc. They will be specialized for the requirement to hold treasuries and etc.\n* FRAX will be specialized to be the  predominant on-chain stablecoin, for everything on-chain.\n* Symbiotic relationship between USDC with Frax and Maker. It's not in Circle and Visa's wheelhouse to do certain stuff.\n* What if government says USDC must blacklist everything unless KYC?\n  * FRAX doesn't hold USDC it deploys it immediately into curve etc. USDC has to literally blacklist everything Curve Uniswap, Compound, AAVE etc.\n  * Sam doesn't think it's going in that direction. If it does go in that direction, to get to FRAX and Maker is to nuke everything - at that point they have bigger problems to worry about.\n* One of the biggest things was the surprising stance on stablecoins they want to keep a bit decentralized stablecoins, helps FRAX and DAI and FEI.\n* What FRAX is building is hard to replicate. Money is the strongest network effect. The more debt denominated/the more liquidity/the more others hold it which makes it harder to dislodge and coordinating a large group to hold it, creates the mother of all network effects.\n\n### FXS, Fraxswap and FraxLend\n\n**FXS**\n\n* FRAX - FXS is not just a mint and burn system.\n* The protocol earns a lot of revenue in CRV, CVX, soon from interest rates from FraxLend etc. and a lot of transaction fees.\n* Frax can buy back FXS if it's the best thing to do, if they know the governance token is highly undervalued compared to other assets on the balance sheet. Possibly buy back through TWAMM.\n\n**Fraxswap**\n\n* New UI, live on preview subdomains\n* Big vision and why they're actually building an AMM and a lending protocol around FXS:\n  * The way they look at it is that they have the concept of trinity:\n  * Every DeFi ecosystem/economy are formed of different flavours of lending, liquidity and currency, which means stablecoins, AMM and lending market.\n  * Many projects build stuff internally but don't go final 10% and make it a general infrastructural product. (i.e. projects already have a form of swap, but do not have a self-serve AMM that people can actually use and which will bring liquidity.)\n* FRAX wants to build this ecosystem strategically:\n  * If they're gonna spend weeks to create something that would allow them buy back FXS or contract supply of FRAX or rebalance collateral, they want to take a professional approach and build a new primitive.\n  * They're building a new AMM (with TWAMM functionality) called Fraxswap to purchase back FXS with protocol profit to be able to contract supply of FRAX, rebalance collateral etc.\n* You can TWAMM into any coin, not just FXS - you can create any pool against FXS. You don't have to create a FRAX pair. You can use any ERC-20 token.\n* TWAMM: User sets time period, every block during this period the user buys a small amount - essentially DCAing, buying small amounts over a period of time.\n* Fraxswap has a fee switch/admin switch that will distribute value to FXS holders.\n* How to bring liquidity into Fraxswap/TWAMM:\n  * TWAMM functionality will cater to large protocol owned liquidity.\n  * Additionally FXS gauges will be used. Anybody that uses Fraxswap for treasury rebalancing etc. they will get FXS gauges.\n  * How will they incentivize gauges?\n    * They will use redacted, pitch.money and votium in the future to earn bribes/incentives.\n* Sam doesn't want to be zero-sum competitors with Curve, they will still deploy largely to Curve. He thinks Fraxswap will be used for volatile pairs for protocols themselves that need to deploy liquidity and rebalance stuff.\n* Future Features:\n  * Through TWAMM, protocols can protect liquid backing by always slowly buying back into until price hits x over next y years and they get to buy low to get to a certain price.\n  * Custom curves. Currently Fraxswap is just regular xy=k curve but with TWAMMs. They're working on custom curves, concentrated liquidity and other unique projects.\n\n**Fraxlend**\n\n* Allows creation of isolated pairs with infinite customizability\n* Fully permissionless\n* Credit-based LTVs: You can create a pair where only whitelisted address of a DAO or individual (e.g. Tetranode) can borrow, and you can modify LTV for that specific pair.\n* It is essentially an entire framework for creating lending systems\n* Same idea of building strategically. You can mint FRAX on Fraxlend, loop and lend it back etc. Can essentially get leverage just like people were able to do with MIM.\n* Why are they doing so much?\n  * They are working/concentrating on FRAX, trying to build a professional and decentralized software, that allows more functionality - as opposed to building a limited/one-dimensional product.\n* Yields generated from Fraxlend would go to FXS holders.\n\n### Ecosystem, Keeping Up With Narratives, FPI & Long Term Vision\n\n**Ecosystem**\n\n* What do you want next for the Frax ecosystem?\n  * The more people build on the gauge ecosystem, the more vibrant the teams building on top of it, with primitives on top of base primitives etc.\n  * Frax's gauges are unique because people can lock the actual LP deposit for a period of time to get an extra boost. This is an anti-reflexive/anti-bank run product as liquidity is locked\n  * Through Stax, Temple will take LP and lock for 3 years, tokenize the position and you can exit your locked tokenized position, while the liquidity is still locked, acting as an anti-reflexive/anti-bank run product.\n\nThe system of locking LP tokens for increased boost is part of design. To kick start an algorithmic stablecoin it is important to have an anti-reflexive/anti-bank run product.\n\\- You can only build this type of product on top of Frax currently, and Temple built a platform on top of this system.\n\nCould Convex do a similar Stax system:\n\\- If Stax becomes the second Convex for Frax, then Convex might adopt their system.\n\n**Keeping Up With Narratives**\n\n* Inside in crypto more than he sees sunlight, around the clock sitting here reading about stuff.\n* If he sees something new, what is it, is it new or fork/improvement?\n* If new is team doing it are they understanding intricacies?\n  * If yes he wants to talk to them and see if he can get involved\n* See where industry is going rather than following right now\n\n**FPI and Yields**\n\n* Frax cannot do something like Anchor etc. so they need to find sustainable, highest growth and attempt to join into new things at the base/start.\n* FPI is the second stablecoin, it's pegged to the CPI. It is an inflation resistant dollar. Grows and tracks the CPI.\n  * FRAX/FPI LP on Convex to earn FXS, Curve vAPY, CRV, CVX as well as FPI yields.\n* What do you mint against FPI:\n  * FPI protocol needs to grow backing at inflation rate or more.\n  * When Fraxlend comes out, users can borrow against FPI or borrow FPI, which will go towards the FPI balance sheet, keeping it collateralized.\n\n**Long Term Vision of FRAX**\n\n* Sam wants to build a full stack/complete economy around FRAX and the new FPI:\n  * Complete economy: lending, liquidity and currency - (stablecoins, AMM and lending market and debt denomination)\n* After a full stack economy is built, then they can think about a potential Frax Roll Up - to capture value of the block space and etc.\n* Unlike Terra they want to build economy first and then build a roll-up, not start as an L1.\n* If block space is valuable enough for people to pay fees, \"months and months from now\", might end up with own Frax Chain or Roll-Up.\n\n## Sam Kazemian on The Defiant\n\n### Current Situation:\n\n* Tough macroeconomic situation.\n* Confidence of stablecoins down and FRAX only 17 months old so relatively new.\n* With stablecoins it's difficult because essentially you spend all your time stabilizing a token to a dollar, just so that it works every time people need to flee to stablecoins\n* They're trying to develop Lindy effects to make sure that they have a stablecoin that is actually being used when there's a flight to safety\n* Proud that FRAX kept peg when everything was de-pegged - happy to be able to develop confidence and Lindy effect similar to DAI and USDC\n\n### Lindy Effect:\n\n* Resilience of protocol acquired over time\n* Why does Sam care about Lindy Effect much?\n* Lindy Effect is social phenomenon that longer something is around, the higher the chance it sticks around\n* Lindy Effect in stablecoins is much longer\n* Longer stablecoin stays at peg, the longer people will think it will survive, which is why it's particularly important for stablecoins.\n\n### How to build Lindy Effect:\n\n* FRAX and DAI or Maker have no competition/issues. FRAX wants sustainable and developing yield, and Maker is not interested in that - one is not necessarily better than the other.\n* Sam wants deep liquidity, use for sustainable LP'ing and staking in Curve.\n  Thinks UST wanted to be similar to FRAX, a fractional algorithmic currency, because it's a more resilient model\n  Terra wanted to be more like FRAX but they never managed to get their collateral ratio high enough\n\n### Depegging and Collateralization:\n\n* Stablecoins need a lot of exogenous collateral\n  FRAX is highly collateralized, and people say isn't that like a fully backed stablecoin\n  FRAx needs to be highly collateralized since it is quite young, it should be 90% backed, it cannot be a fiat like currency yet, it's only 17 months old.\n  That's why they have been trying to be similar to DAI, to have lots of hard-backed collateral, to lower bank-run chances and reflexivity\n* The only similarity FRAX currently has to algorithmic stablecoins is the name, right now it's not necessarily algorithmic\n* FRAX kind of passed the test of terrible market conditions.\n\n### Full Stack Economy:\n\n* They want to constantly improve, it will never be a finished product\n* They've been building 24/7, they want to build the FRAX full stack economy.\n  A full permissionless economy, with TWAMM and FRAXSwap\n  TWAMM - a good system for protocol owned liquidity: allows balancing large amounts of collateral and making large market orders\n  Can also be used like Uniswap V2.\n* Essentially building a full economy around FRAX and using FXS, not a random bunch of tokens.\n  Want to create liquidity and capture value, debt denominated in your own infrastructure, like Maker and CDP and DAI\n  Full DeFi stack\n  Lending, liquidity and currency\n  When things are good, traditionally stablecoins don't have much velocity and have low fees\n  Which is why they need to find ways to generate velocity and fees\n* Use cases of money: store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange\n  * FRAX has been a good store of value, but they want to have more trading pairs and debt denominated in it (loans), to make sure that they satisfy all use cases of money - to capture value.\n\n### Buyback and UST Aftermath:\n\n* They make 80 million dollars in annual revenue, they want to buy back 20 million of FXS using TWAMM.\n* They are proposing it now, because FXS has been hit hard, harder than most bc of stablecoin confidence.\n* FXS lost a lot of value, not just because of market conditions, but also because of general distrust of stablecoins after UST depeg/Luna disaster.\n* It's not always good to buyback and burn governance token, you want to increase balance sheet, put it towards growth etc.\n* However, if the market misprices (according to us), the token and is undervalued, compared to other tokens that could be bought and put on the balance sheet.\n* Logically, the most useful thing to do is buyback and retire the governance tokens. They think that FXS is undervalued, and it's the best use of protocol profits. FXS dropped 38 ATH to 6.38. FRAX is creating revenue, it's a resilient protocol, going to have more rev bc of swap and lending.\n\n### Marketing and FRAX:\n\n* How has FRAX decided to talk to Yellen and convince about FRAX.\n* They have different ethos for marketing: everything is provable on-chain: FRAX team is just 8 to 9 engineers, no marketing team, DeFi focused. There's a lot of FUD, they're not interested on twitter and don't want to convince to be believed, they're on chain and transparent\n* They have shown that they are protected from a bank run because of amount of liquidity and locked liquidity and integrations FRAX wouldn't depeg due to current collateral ratio, they can see, everyone can see because we're on chain and transparent. Maybe we made a mistake go verify it.\n* 46 million FRAX can still be printed and expanded and would still be impossible to bank run. They run internal tests and are meticulous about keeping it all on-chain, no CEX and market maker relationships - just like Maker. Everything is in smart contracts, there marketing is the tech and keep it on-chain.\n\n### Fraxswap and Curve Competition:\n\n* One of the biggest proposals recently is the FraxBasePool:\n  Closest thing to risk-free, because it's with USDC\n  They will essentially own part of Curve as they grow with it. They want to become their meta stable coin, since Curve cannot issue their own stablecoin.\n  They're collaborative, they just want to grow the whole DeFi pie, no competition, no value lost, gain value from both of them.\n\n### Basket of assets that back the stablecoin:\n\n* Some curve LP tokens lower volatility, some WBTC and ETH\n  They're looking to increase volatile assets that back FRAX, especially during bear market where prices are down. Good time to increase with profits and not with seigniorage to not take asymmetric risks), to create a resilient and strong peg.\n* Increasing ETH exposure/backing would also allow FRAX to expand the ability for Frax PoS staking service, a Frax ETH derivative of sorts like Lido.\n  It makes sense to have Frax have the ability to have proof of stake validator infrastructure issue 1:1 FRAX/ETH derivative that can back FRAX. Essentially create more value.\n\n### Future:\n\n* Sam has been in the industry 7-8 years. They don't do stuff for the fun of it, they want to consider what will stuff look like in a year? How to get their incrementally?\n* The staked Lido type system not for profit, they're building full stack economy:\n* If they're gonna have liquidity, lending and currency, the last part of that is the actual network, the blockspace, to own a piece of the blockchain, and participate.\n* To make the FRAX economy the largest consensus forming Schelling points, to capture the value of those transaction fees.\n\n### Real World Assets:\n\n* Terrible time to take real world risks, but good time to build relationships and infrastructure when things turn around\n* They're currently working with goldfinch etc. to talk about how they can do real world lending through them, but market conditions are not great.\n* They agree with Maker guys on real world assets:\n  If you're going to have debt denominated in your stablecoin, you need the actual stablecoin to issue credit and debt for actual economic activity, not just degenerate behaviour.\n  There's actually a real use case for DeFi, if FRAX and Maker will ever scale to trillion dollars of supply, there has to be real economic lending in the real world.\n  Hopefully will become a less risky endeavour in a better market value\n\n### Algorithmic Stablecoin Definition and Current Prognosis for USD:\n\nThe outdated algorithmic stablecoin old system doesn't work.\nVolatile governance token being used to stabilize the other token created out of thin air doesn't work.\nFRAX premise was just that: it doesn't work, we need exogenous collateral, only small amounts of algorithmic.\nThey need to build Lindy and almost entirety of it needs to be backed by assets.\n\n### Whats Sam's prognosis for USD?\n\n```\nUSD doesn't look great.\nWhat FRAX is working on is the FPI. \n\tPegged to the CPI, inflation resistant dollar. \n\tCurrent unit of account of world is USD, 80%+ trade is denominated in it. \n\tWhatever will be successor has to be self-sovereign peg or some other stablecoin that has a stability to a basket of assets humans care about.\n\tThree trillion dollar narratives: BTC, ETH and Stablecoins.\n```", "timestamp": 1658198814, "digest": "oDtUkrZJHq85eZwbsI8vlLJQkHf9yL0SIZTnXrMVxvI", "contributor": "0xfF8Fa9737169903FEb053d6320d7088cF6EC861B"}

// 0.1 LINK (VRF使用费，Rinkkeby测试网)\n    }\n```\n\n**2. 用户合约申请随机数**\n\n用户可以调用从`VRFConsumerBase`合约继承来的`requestRandomness()`申请随机数，并返回申请标识符`requestId`。这个申请会传递给`VRF`合约。\n\n```solidity\n    /** \n     * 向VRF合约申请随机数 \n     */\n    function getRandomNumber() public returns (bytes32 requestId) {\n        // 合约中需要有足够的LINK\n        require(LINK.balanceOf(address(this)) >= fee, \"Not enough LINK - fill contract with faucet\");\n\n        return requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);\n    }\n```\n\n**3.** `Chainlink`节点链下生成随机数和[数字签名](https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTFSolidity/blob/main/37_Signature/readme.md)，并发送给`VRF`合约\n\n**4.** `VRF`合约验证签名有效性\n\n**5. 用户合约接收并使用随机数**\n\n在`VRF`合约验证签名有效之后，会自动调用用户合约的回退函数`fulfillRandomness()`，将链下生成的随机数发送过来。用户要把消耗随机数的逻辑写在这里。\n\n**注意:** 用户申请随机数时调用的`requestRandomness()`和`VRF`合约返回随机数时调用的回退函数`fulfillRandomness()`是两笔交易，调用者分别是用户合约和`VRF`合约，后者比前者晚几分钟（不同链延迟不一样）。\n\n```solidity\n    /**\n     * VRF合约的回调函数，验证随机数有效之后会自动被调用\n     * 消耗随机数的逻辑写在这里\n     */\n    function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness) internal override {\n        randomResult = randomness;\n    }\n```\n\n## `tokenId`随机铸造的`NFT`\n\n这一节，我们将利用链上和链下随机数来做一款`tokenId`随机铸造的`NFT`。`Random`合约继承`ERC721`和`VRFConsumerBase`合约。\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n\nimport \"https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTFSolidity/blob/main/34_ERC721/ERC721.sol\";\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBase.sol\";\n\ncontract Random is ERC721, VRFConsumerBase{\n```\n\n### 状态变量\n\n* `NFT`相关\n  * `totalSupply`：`NFT`总供给。\n  * `ids`：数组，用于计算可供`mint`的`tokenId`，见`pickRandomUniqueId()`函数。\n  * `mintCount`：已经`mint`的数量。\n* `Chainlink VRF`相关\n  * `keyHash`:`VRF`唯一标识符。\n  * `fee`：`VRF`手续费。\n  * `requestToSender`：记录申请`VRF`用于铸造的用户地址。\n\n```solidity\n    // NFT相关\n    uint256 public totalSupply = 100;

\n```\n\n### 构造函数\n\n初始化继承的`VRFConsumerBase`和`ERC721`合约的相关变量。\n\n```solidity\n    /**\n     * 使用chainlink VRF，构造函数需要继承 VRFConsumerBase \n     * 不同链参数填的不一样\n     * 网络: Rinkeby测试网\n     * Chainlink VRF Coordinator 地址: 0xb3dCcb4Cf7a26f6cf6B120Cf5A73875B7BBc655B\n     * LINK 代币地址: 0x01BE23585060835E02B77ef475b0Cc51aA1e0709\n     * Key Hash: 0x2ed0feb3e7fd2022120aa84fab1945545a9f2ffc9076fd6156fa96eaff4c1311\n     */\n    constructor() \n        VRFConsumerBase(\n            0xb3dCcb4Cf7a26f6cf6B120Cf5A73875B7BBc655B, // VRF Coordinator\n            0x01BE23585060835E02B77ef475b0Cc51aA1e0709  // LINK Token\n        )\n        ERC721(\"WTF Random\", \"WTF\")\n    {\n        keyHash = 0x2ed0feb3e7fd2022120aa84fab1945545a9f2ffc9076fd6156fa96eaff4c1311;\n        fee = 0.1 * 10 ** 18; // 0.1 LINK (VRF使用费，Rinkkeby测试网)\n    }\n```\n\n### 其他函数\n\n除了构造函数以外，合约里还定义了`5`个函数。\n\n* `pickRandomUniqueId()`：输入随机数，获取可供`mint`的`tokenId`。\n* `getRandomOnchain()`：获取链上随机数（不安全）。\n* `mintRandomOnchain()`：利用链上随机数铸造`NFT`，调用了`getRandomOnchain()`和`pickRandomUniqueId()`。\n* `mintRandomVRF()`：申请`Chainlink VRF`用于铸造随机数。由于使用随机数铸造的逻辑在回调函数`fulfillRandomness()`，而回调函数的调用者是`VRF`合约，而非铸造`NFT`的用户，这里必须利用`requestToSender`状态变量记录`VRF`申请标识符对应的用户地址。\n* `fulfillRandomness()`：`VRF`的回调函数，由`VRF`合约在验证随机数真实性后自动调用，用返回的链下随机数铸造`NFT`。\n\n```solidity\n    /** \n    * 输入uint256数字，返回一个可以mint的tokenId\n    */\n    function pickRandomUniqueId(uint256 random) private returns (uint256 tokenId) {\n        uint256 len = totalSupply - mintCount++;

Hopefully will be able to make it a weekly thing.\n\n## Sam Kazemian on Market Capping\n\n### Fun Fact\n\nFRAX logo/symbol is the unspecified general currency sign - when internet came out they had a placeholder for general currency symbol, for what they thought would be the general internet currency symbol.\n\n### FRAX, Curve & FraxBasePool\n\n* Frax started out of the concept that if you have a protocol that controls its own liquidity and collateral like, you can deploy it into AMM's and the protocol itself can earn yield and transaction fees.\n* Before, instead everybody just rented liquidity and paid their governance token to rent liquidity inside of these AMMs/DEX's.\n* Curve AMO that Frax developed, (which is just a smart contract that sends collateral and extra FRAX into FRAX's curve pool), essentially allows Frax to become largest TVL and controllers of liquidity on Curve.\n* Obviously 4pool won't be happening anymore. Frax went back to drawing board to implement/create a similar system, that can be done risk-free: a FraxBasePool where Frax can allow other projects to pair with FRAX liquidity.\n* FraxBasePool: Just FRAX-USDC (least risky because USDC is basically tokenized treasuries).\n  * Any project that pairs with FRAX base pool will proportionally get incentivized by demand they create.\n  * When projects use 3pool, they have to basically rent liquidity and subsidize USDC-DAI-USDT.\n  * FraxBasePool you pair with FRAX-USDC, Frax doesn't keep what you help grow, doesn't keep CRV-CVX, they channel it back to you.\n  * Instead they build a network effect around the FraxBasePool as a Schelling point for liquidity, and give back proportional to demand for FBP by protocol.\n  * LPs earn yield just by using FraxBasePool, Frax not involved with other stablecoins, so no esoteric risk coming from other stables - only FRAX-USDC risk.\n* Timeline of FraxBasePool:\n  * Sam's been talking to Mitch (founder of Curve).\n  * Curve needs to deploy the FraxBasePool themselves.\n  * After team deploys, CurveDAO vote will allow FraxBasePool up as other option (aside from 3Pool).\n  * Second part of proposal is about whitelisting veCRV.\n  * Whitelisting will let Frax to permanently lock all FraxBasePool earnings that the protocol earns from its collateral and expansions (that don't go to other protocols as yield).\n  * Through this Frax can permanently vote FBP for the gauge weight etc. The more Frax can earn the more they can distribute to other protocols that pair.\n  * No more dumping CRV from FRAX - good for CVX and CRV since less sell pressure.\n* FRAX has good volume but not much velocity of money - to fix that they want to be a central liquidity locust, through FraxBasePool. FRAX will become high volume, high turnover money.\n* FRAX has historically been a good savings stablecoin, good yields, stable peg and has been lindy - doesn't have much velocity - which FraxBasePool and FraxLending will improve.\n\n### AMOs, Collateral Ratio, Decentralization Ratio & Doomsday Situation\n\n**AMOs**\n\n* When people mint FRAX into the new base pool/or put FRAX in there, they have to use USDC to mint that FRAX. That USDC comes into the Frax protocol. Frax takes that USDC and puts it into the AMOs.\n* The other direction can also happen. AMOs can mint and burn FRAX and move collateral (USDC). Someone can buy FRAX from Curve pool until curve pool is imbalanced then AMO can mint FRAX to balance it 50/50 and get LP tokens.\n\n**Collateral Ratio**\n\n* Collateral ratio is entirely backed by hard assets. Rest is FXS and other assets that aren't immediately liquid like vlCVX.\n* FRAX has a lot of locked liquidity in a lot of different places. If you take a deterministic analysis by looking at entire landscape of user owned FRAX and protocol owned FRAX you see that there cannot be a bank run right now.\n* Collateral ratio shows amount of FRAX backed by USDC (hard assets). Rest is backed by FXS and other volatile assets vlcvx.  One of the things in times of liquidity crisis/bank runs etc. if you take a full look at entire landscape of user owned frax etc.\n\n**Decentralization Ratio**\n\n* Decentralization ratio is amount of FRAX backed by completely non-custodial assets: non-fiat coins, not wBTC etc.\n* If FRAX is backed partially by DAI - DAI itself is 65% centralized assets. The ratio only counts decentralized version of DAI (because underlying DAI has claims on USDC etc.)\n\n**Doomsday situation**\n\n* If you simulate everything, FRAX is entirely deterministic, no Jump, no market makers, no collateral off-chain, what you see is what you get - everything is on-chain.\n* What if every single person farming FRAX pulled their Curve LP and dumped?\n* Currently it will not depeg. This is because there's a lot of locked liquidity and a lot of protocol owned liquidity.\n* Future depends on locked liquidity, how much debt denomination it has etc.\n\n### TradFi & Legislations\n\n* Sam thinks recent bill is bullish.\n\n**FRAX vs USDC, VISA et al.**\n\n* Its outside of FRAX's scope to try and do things off-chain.\n  * Doesn't want to incorporate a company and hold treasuries with Frax etc.\n* There will always be use for USDC or if Visa came out with a stablecoin or something. (something like BridgeFi)\n* But USDC will not build AMOs or AMM primitives like TWAMM etc. to integrate liquidity into protocols etc. They will be specialized for the requirement to hold treasuries and etc.\n* FRAX will be specialized to be the  predominant on-chain stablecoin, for everything on-chain.\n* Symbiotic relationship between USDC with Frax and Maker. It's not in Circle and Visa's wheelhouse to do certain stuff.\n* What if government says USDC must blacklist everything unless KYC?\n  * FRAX doesn't hold USDC it deploys it immediately into curve etc. USDC has to literally blacklist everything Curve Uniswap, Compound, AAVE etc.\n  * Sam doesn't think it's going in that direction. If it does go in that direction, to get to FRAX and Maker is to nuke everything - at that point they have bigger problems to worry about.\n* One of the biggest things was the surprising stance on stablecoins they want to keep a bit decentralized stablecoins, helps FRAX and DAI and FEI.\n* What FRAX is building is hard to replicate. Money is the strongest network effect. The more debt denominated/the more liquidity/the more others hold it which makes it harder to dislodge and coordinating a large group to hold it, creates the mother of all network effects.\n\n### FXS, Fraxswap and FraxLend\n\n**FXS**\n\n* FRAX - FXS is not just a mint and burn system.\n* The protocol earns a lot of revenue in CRV, CVX, soon from interest rates from FraxLend etc. and a lot of transaction fees.\n* Frax can buy back FXS if it's the best thing to do, if they know the governance token is highly undervalued compared to other assets on the balance sheet. Possibly buy back through TWAMM.\n\n**Fraxswap**\n\n* New UI, live on preview subdomains\n* Big vision and why they're actually building an AMM and a lending protocol around FXS:\n  * The way they look at it is that they have the concept of trinity:\n  * Every DeFi ecosystem/economy are formed of different flavours of lending, liquidity and currency, which means stablecoins, AMM and lending market.\n  * Many projects build stuff internally but don't go final 10% and make it a general infrastructural product. (i.e. projects already have a form of swap, but do not have a self-serve AMM that people can actually use and which will bring liquidity.)\n* FRAX wants to build this ecosystem strategically:\n  * If they're gonna spend weeks to create something that would allow them buy back FXS or contract supply of FRAX or rebalance collateral, they want to take a professional approach and build a new primitive.\n  * They're building a new AMM (with TWAMM functionality) called Fraxswap to purchase back FXS with protocol profit to be able to contract supply of FRAX, rebalance collateral etc.\n* You can TWAMM into any coin, not just FXS - you can create any pool against FXS. You don't have to create a FRAX pair. You can use any ERC-20 token.\n* TWAMM: User sets time period, every block during this period the user buys a small amount - essentially DCAing, buying small amounts over a period of time.\n* Fraxswap has a fee switch/admin switch that will distribute value to FXS holders.\n* How to bring liquidity into Fraxswap/TWAMM:\n  * TWAMM functionality will cater to large protocol owned liquidity.\n  * Additionally FXS gauges will be used. Anybody that uses Fraxswap for treasury rebalancing etc. they will get FXS gauges.\n  * How will they incentivize gauges?\n    * They will use redacted, pitch.money and votium in the future to earn bribes/incentives.\n* Sam doesn't want to be zero-sum competitors with Curve, they will still deploy largely to Curve. He thinks Fraxswap will be used for volatile pairs for protocols themselves that need to deploy liquidity and rebalance stuff.\n* Future Features:\n  * Through TWAMM, protocols can protect liquid backing by always slowly buying back into until price hits x over next y years and they get to buy low to get to a certain price.\n  * Custom curves. Currently Fraxswap is just regular xy=k curve but with TWAMMs. They're working on custom curves, concentrated liquidity and other unique projects.\n\n**Fraxlend**\n\n* Allows creation of isolated pairs with infinite customizability\n* Fully permissionless\n* Credit-based LTVs: You can create a pair where only whitelisted address of a DAO or individual (e.g. Tetranode) can borrow, and you can modify LTV for that specific pair.\n* It is essentially an entire framework for creating lending systems\n* Same idea of building strategically. You can mint FRAX on Fraxlend, loop and lend it back etc. Can essentially get leverage just like people were able to do with MIM.\n* Why are they doing so much?\n  * They are working/concentrating on FRAX, trying to build a professional and decentralized software, that allows more functionality - as opposed to building a limited/one-dimensional product.\n* Yields generated from Fraxlend would go to FXS holders.\n\n### Ecosystem, Keeping Up With Narratives, FPI & Long Term Vision\n\n**Ecosystem**\n\n* What do you want next for the Frax ecosystem?\n  * The more people build on the gauge ecosystem, the more vibrant the teams building on top of it, with primitives on top of base primitives etc.\n  * Frax's gauges are unique because people can lock the actual LP deposit for a period of time to get an extra boost. This is an anti-reflexive/anti-bank run product as liquidity is locked\n  * Through Stax, Temple will take LP and lock for 3 years, tokenize the position and you can exit your locked tokenized position, while the liquidity is still locked, acting as an anti-reflexive/anti-bank run product.\n\nThe system of locking LP tokens for increased boost is part of design. To kick start an algorithmic stablecoin it is important to have an anti-reflexive/anti-bank run product.\n\\- You can only build this type of product on top of Frax currently, and Temple built a platform on top of this system.\n\nCould Convex do a similar Stax system:\n\\- If Stax becomes the second Convex for Frax, then Convex might adopt their system.\n\n**Keeping Up With Narratives**\n\n* Inside in crypto more than he sees sunlight, around the clock sitting here reading about stuff.\n* If he sees something new, what is it, is it new or fork/improvement?\n* If new is team doing it are they understanding intricacies?\n  * If yes he wants to talk to them and see if he can get involved\n* See where industry is going rather than following right now\n\n**FPI and Yields**\n\n* Frax cannot do something like Anchor etc. so they need to find sustainable, highest growth and attempt to join into new things at the base/start.\n* FPI is the second stablecoin, it's pegged to the CPI. It is an inflation resistant dollar. Grows and tracks the CPI.\n  * FRAX/FPI LP on Convex to earn FXS, Curve vAPY, CRV, CVX as well as FPI yields.\n* What do you mint against FPI:\n  * FPI protocol needs to grow backing at inflation rate or more.\n  * When Fraxlend comes out, users can borrow against FPI or borrow FPI, which will go towards the FPI balance sheet, keeping it collateralized.\n\n**Long Term Vision of FRAX**\n\n* Sam wants to build a full stack/complete economy around FRAX and the new FPI:\n  * Complete economy: lending, liquidity and currency - (stablecoins, AMM and lending market and debt denomination)\n* After a full stack economy is built, then they can think about a potential Frax Roll Up - to capture value of the block space and etc.\n* Unlike Terra they want to build economy first and then build a roll-up, not start as an L1.\n* If block space is valuable enough for people to pay fees, \"months and months from now\", might end up with own Frax Chain or Roll-Up.\n\n## Sam Kazemian on The Defiant\n\n### Current Situation:\n\n* Tough macroeconomic situation.\n* Confidence of stablecoins down and FRAX only 17 months old so relatively new.\n* With stablecoins it's difficult because essentially you spend all your time stabilizing a token to a dollar, just so that it works every time people need to flee to stablecoins\n* They're trying to develop Lindy effects to make sure that they have a stablecoin that is actually being used when there's a flight to safety\n* Proud that FRAX kept peg when everything was de-pegged - happy to be able to develop confidence and Lindy effect similar to DAI and USDC\n\n### Lindy Effect:\n\n* Resilience of protocol acquired over time\n* Why does Sam care about Lindy Effect much?\n* Lindy Effect is social phenomenon that longer something is around, the higher the chance it sticks around\n* Lindy Effect in stablecoins is much longer\n* Longer stablecoin stays at peg, the longer people will think it will survive, which is why it's particularly important for stablecoins.\n\n### How to build Lindy Effect:\n\n* FRAX and DAI or Maker have no competition/issues. FRAX wants sustainable and developing yield, and Maker is not interested in that - one is not necessarily better than the other.\n* Sam wants deep liquidity, use for sustainable LP'ing and staking in Curve.\n  Thinks UST wanted to be similar to FRAX, a fractional algorithmic currency, because it's a more resilient model\n  Terra wanted to be more like FRAX but they never managed to get their collateral ratio high enough\n\n### Depegging and Collateralization:\n\n* Stablecoins need a lot of exogenous collateral\n  FRAX is highly collateralized, and people say isn't that like a fully backed stablecoin\n  FRAx needs to be highly collateralized since it is quite young, it should be 90% backed, it cannot be a fiat like currency yet, it's only 17 months old.\n  That's why they have been trying to be similar to DAI, to have lots of hard-backed collateral, to lower bank-run chances and reflexivity\n* The only similarity FRAX currently has to algorithmic stablecoins is the name, right now it's not necessarily algorithmic\n* FRAX kind of passed the test of terrible market conditions.\n\n### Full Stack Economy:\n\n* They want to constantly improve, it will never be a finished product\n* They've been building 24/7, they want to build the FRAX full stack economy.\n  A full permissionless economy, with TWAMM and FRAXSwap\n  TWAMM - a good system for protocol owned liquidity: allows balancing large amounts of collateral and making large market orders\n  Can also be used like Uniswap V2.\n* Essentially building a full economy around FRAX and using FXS, not a random bunch of tokens.\n  Want to create liquidity and capture value, debt denominated in your own infrastructure, like Maker and CDP and DAI\n  Full DeFi stack\n  Lending, liquidity and currency\n  When things are good, traditionally stablecoins don't have much velocity and have low fees\n  Which is why they need to find ways to generate velocity and fees\n* Use cases of money: store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange\n  * FRAX has been a good store of value, but they want to have more trading pairs and debt denominated in it (loans), to make sure that they satisfy all use cases of money - to capture value.\n\n### Buyback and UST Aftermath:\n\n* They make 80 million dollars in annual revenue, they want to buy back 20 million of FXS using TWAMM.\n* They are proposing it now, because FXS has been hit hard, harder than most bc of stablecoin confidence.\n* FXS lost a lot of value, not just because of market conditions, but also because of general distrust of stablecoins after UST depeg/Luna disaster.\n* It's not always good to buyback and burn governance token, you want to increase balance sheet, put it towards growth etc.\n* However, if the market misprices (according to us), the token and is undervalued, compared to other tokens that could be bought and put on the balance sheet.\n* Logically, the most useful thing to do is buyback and retire the governance tokens. They think that FXS is undervalued, and it's the best use of protocol profits. FXS dropped 38 ATH to 6.38. FRAX is creating revenue, it's a resilient protocol, going to have more rev bc of swap and lending.\n\n### Marketing and FRAX:\n\n* How has FRAX decided to talk to Yellen and convince about FRAX.\n* They have different ethos for marketing: everything is provable on-chain: FRAX team is just 8 to 9 engineers, no marketing team, DeFi focused. There's a lot of FUD, they're not interested on twitter and don't want to convince to be believed, they're on chain and transparent\n* They have shown that they are protected from a bank run because of amount of liquidity and locked liquidity and integrations FRAX wouldn't depeg due to current collateral ratio, they can see, everyone can see because we're on chain and transparent. Maybe we made a mistake go verify it.\n* 46 million FRAX can still be printed and expanded and would still be impossible to bank run. They run internal tests and are meticulous about keeping it all on-chain, no CEX and market maker relationships - just like Maker. Everything is in smart contracts, there marketing is the tech and keep it on-chain.\n\n### Fraxswap and Curve Competition:\n\n* One of the biggest proposals recently is the FraxBasePool:\n  Closest thing to risk-free, because it's with USDC\n  They will essentially own part of Curve as they grow with it. They want to become their meta stable coin, since Curve cannot issue their own stablecoin.\n  They're collaborative, they just want to grow the whole DeFi pie, no competition, no value lost, gain value from both of them.\n\n### Basket of assets that back the stablecoin:\n\n* Some curve LP tokens lower volatility, some WBTC and ETH\n  They're looking to increase volatile assets that back FRAX, especially during bear market where prices are down. Good time to increase with profits and not with seigniorage to not take asymmetric risks), to create a resilient and strong peg.\n* Increasing ETH exposure/backing would also allow FRAX to expand the ability for Frax PoS staking service, a Frax ETH derivative of sorts like Lido.\n  It makes sense to have Frax have the ability to have proof of stake validator infrastructure issue 1:1 FRAX/ETH derivative that can back FRAX. Essentially create more value.\n\n### Future:\n\n* Sam has been in the industry 7-8 years. They don't do stuff for the fun of it, they want to consider what will stuff look like in a year? How to get their incrementally?\n* The staked Lido type system not for profit, they're building full stack economy:\n* If they're gonna have liquidity, lending and currency, the last part of that is the actual network, the blockspace, to own a piece of the blockchain, and participate.\n* To make the FRAX economy the largest consensus forming Schelling points, to capture the value of those transaction fees.\n\n### Real World Assets:\n\n* Terrible time to take real world risks, but good time to build relationships and infrastructure when things turn around\n* They're currently working with goldfinch etc. to talk about how they can do real world lending through them, but market conditions are not great.\n* They agree with Maker guys on real world assets:\n  If you're going to have debt denominated in your stablecoin, you need the actual stablecoin to issue credit and debt for actual economic activity, not just degenerate behaviour.\n  There's actually a real use case for DeFi, if FRAX and Maker will ever scale to trillion dollars of supply, there has to be real economic lending in the real world.\n  Hopefully will become a less risky endeavour in a better market value\n\n### Algorithmic Stablecoin Definition and Current Prognosis for USD:\n\nThe outdated algorithmic stablecoin old system doesn't work.\nVolatile governance token being used to stabilize the other token created out of thin air doesn't work.\nFRAX premise was just that: it doesn't work, we need exogenous collateral, only small amounts of algorithmic.\nThey need to build Lindy and almost entirety of it needs to be backed by assets.\n\n### Whats Sam's prognosis for USD?\n\n```\nUSD doesn't look great.\nWhat FRAX is working on is the FPI. \n\tPegged to the CPI, inflation resistant dollar. \n\tCurrent unit of account of world is USD, 80%+ trade is denominated in it. \n\tWhatever will be successor has to be self-sovereign peg or some other stablecoin that has a stability to a basket of assets humans care about.\n\tThree trillion dollar narratives: BTC, ETH and Stablecoins.\n```", "timestamp": 1658198794, "digest": "CzJqPlzQYmlQIXAL6v4dn5BeUUuXi84LxYGIbK7oP5c", "contributor": "0xfF8Fa9737169903FEb053d6320d7088cF6EC861B"}
{"id": "WJDU3QEQtf5RieKnNWJcLIJYvvStMXSOy-L30oMr31o", "title": "Solidity极简入门: 39. 链上随机数", "body": "我最近在重新学solidity，巩固一下细节，也写一个“Solidity极简入门”，供小白们使用，每周更新1-3讲。\n\n推特：[@0xAA_Science](https://twitter.com/0xAA_Science)\n\ndiscord：[WTF Academy](https://discord.gg/5akcruXrsk)\n\n所有代码和教程开源在github: [github.com/AmazingAng/WTFSolidity](https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTFSolidity)\n\n\n-----\n\n很多以太坊上的应用都需要用到随机数，例如`NFT`随机抽取`tokenId`、抽盲盒、`gamefi`战斗中随机分胜负等等。但是由于以太坊上所有数据都是公开透明（`public`）且确定性（`deterministic`）的，它没法像其他编程语言一样给开发者提供生成随机数的方法。这一讲我们将介绍链上（哈希函数）和链下（`chainlink`预言机）随机数生成的两种方法，并利用它们做一款`tokenId`随机铸造的`NFT`。\n\n## 链上随机数生成\n\n我们可以一些链上的全局变量作为种子，利用`keccak256()`哈希函数来获取伪随机数。这是因为哈希函数具有灵敏性和均一性，可以得到“看似”随机的结果。下面的`getRandomOnchain()`函数利用全局变量`block.number`，`msg.sender`和`blockhash(block.timestamp-1)`作为种子来获取随机数：\n\n```solidity\n    /** \n    * 链上伪随机数生成\n    * 利用keccak256()打包一些链上的全局变量/自定义变量\n    * 返回时转换成uint256类型\n    */\n    function getRandomOnchain() public view returns(uint256){\n        // remix运行blockhash会报错\n        bytes32 randomBytes = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.number, msg.sender, blockhash(block.timestamp-1)));\n        \n        return uint256(randomBytes);\n    }\n```\n\n注意，这个方法并不安全：\n\n* 首先，`block.number`，`msg.sender`和`blockhash(block.timestamp-1)`这些变量都是公开的，使用者可以预测出用这些种子生成出的随机数，并挑出他们想要的随机数执行合约。\n* 其次，矿工可以操纵`blockhash`和`block.timestamp`，使得生成的随机数符合他的利益。\n\n尽管如此，由于这种方法是最便捷的链上随机数生成方法，大量项目方依靠它来生成不安全的随机数，包括知名的项目`meebits`，`loots`等。当然，这些项目也无一例外的被[攻击](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/understanding-the-meebits-exploit/8281)了：攻击者可以铸造任何他们想要的稀有`NFT`，而非随机抽取。\n\n## 链下随机数生成\n\n我们可以在链下生成随机数，然后通过预言机把随机数上传到链上。`Chainlink`提供`VRF`（可验证随机函数）服务，链上开发者可以支付`LINK`代币来获取随机数。` Chainlink VRF`有两个版本，因为第二个版本需要官网注册并预付费，且用法类似，这里只介绍第一个版本`VRF v1`。\n\n### 使用Chainlink VRF\n\n![Chainlink VRF](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5WxCr0A1I9oOrFTDF2qNc.png?height=323&width=1000)\n\n我们将用一个简单的合约介绍如何使用`Chainlink VRF`。`RandomNumberConsumer`合约可以向`VRF`请求一个随机数，并存储在状态变量`randomResult`中。\n\n**1. 用户合约继承**`VRFConsumerBase`并转入`LINK`代币\n\n为了使用`VRF`获取随机数，合约需要继承`VRFConsumerBase`合约，并在构造函数中初始化`VRF Coordinator`地址，`LINK`代币地址，唯一标识符`Key Hash`，和使用费用`fee`。\n\n**注意:** 不同链对应不同的参数，在[这里](https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf-contracts/v1/)查询。\n\n教程中我们使用`Rinkeby`测试网。部署好合约后，用户需要向合约转一些`LINK`代币，测试网的`LINK`代币可以从[LINK水龙头](https://faucets.chain.link/)领取。\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBase.sol\";\n\ncontract RandomNumberConsumer is VRFConsumerBase {\n    \n    bytes32 internal keyHash;

Tagore's writing is a unique freshness, as if the air on the untouched natural wilderness, under the overwhelming bright sunshine, opens a window to heaven for us...\n\n\\--Inscription\n\nOn the small and delicate light yellow cover, a flock of geese flying high, and three soft and firm black characters \"Stray Birds\" - this is the most conspicuous position on my desktop. on a book. And just yesterday, in the ethereal and ethereal voice of Jin Hai, I just finished reading this classic collection of Tagore's poems - \"Flying Birds\".\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YboBJW-WvFzin_ytXnrSu.png?height=1308&width=736)\n\n\"Flying Birds\" consists of 105 poems. Each poem has only two or three short sentences, but in the dark, it quietly lights up something for us. And in these poignant short poems that combine inspiration and thinking, Tagore shows us his multiple identities - he is sometimes an infant, dancing for his mother's smile; sometimes he is a cosmopolitan The explorer of the family sighs towards the mountains and the sea; sometimes he is a young man in love, sings love for his beloved girl; sometimes he is an old man with silver hair, reflecting on his life alone in his memories; Just a nameless passer-by, recording the flashing moments of inspiration for everything in the world, and then leaving quietly with a smile.\n\nApart from Tagore's fresh and natural writing, in \"Flying Birds\", what I feel more is a kind of love for life and thinking about love. There is no doubt that Tagore's inspiration comes from life, but at the same time it is higher than life; he used his love for life to subtly hide some suffering and darkness, and dedicate the remaining light and smile to unreservedly. readers. His thoughts on love cover many aspects, including the pure love between young men and women, the eternal maternal love of a mother for her child, and the indescribable love between man and nature... Especially for love, Tagore used it without hesitation. A lot of figurative rhetoric to praise the beauty and greatness of love. In Tagore's eyes, the world needs love, and life needs love more, just as he wrote in \"Flying Birds\": \"I believe in your love, let this be my last word.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Tagore captured a lot of inspiration about the natural world. He said that the dusk of the sky was like a lamp, that the leaves in the breeze were like fragments of thoughts, that the singing of birds was the echo of the morning sun from the earth; he personified everything in nature. He let the sky and the sea talk, let the birds talk to the clouds, let the flowers talk to the sun... In short, in Tagore's poems, the world is humanized, and nature is also humanized, and everything has its own growth and development. thinking; and he is merely sorting thought fragments for their humanity. And this is also the origin of the name of \"Flying Birds\": \"Thoughts swept through my heart, like flocks of wild ducks flying across the sky, I heard the sound of their wings flying high.\"\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FJb3kqYfGLDm3eLdcYSGq.png?height=474&width=480)\n\n……\n\nThis is Tagore, this is \"The Birds\".

In a small town in the western United States, a little boy about ten years old held a $1 coin and asked shop by shop along the street: \"Excuse me, do you have a god for sale here? ?\" The shopkeeper either said no, or thought he was messing up and kicked him out of the shop without any reason.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PJo3bn-d4VrzqEPuvEePw.png?height=1334&width=750)\n\nWhen it was getting dark, the little boy stubbornly said to the owner of the 69th store: \"Excuse me, do you have a god for sale here?\"\n\nThe boss was a silver-haired, kind-hearted old man in his 60s. He smiled and asked the little boy, \"Tell me, child, why are you buying God?\"\n\nSomeone responded, the little boy burst into tears with excitement, and told the boss that his parents died a long time ago, and now his uncle is raising him. My uncle was working on a construction site. He fell off the scaffolding not long ago and is still in a coma. The doctor said that only God could save him. God must be a very wonderful thing, the little boy thought.\n\n\"I bought God back and let my uncle eat it, and the injury will heal.\"\n\nAfter listening to the little boy's narration, the boss's eyes were also wet, and he asked, \"How much money do you have?\"\n\n\"1.\"\n\n\"Son, right now God's price is exactly $1.\"\n\nThe boss took the coin from the little boy's hand, took a bottle of \"God's Kiss\" brand drink from the shelf, and said to the little boy: \"Take it, child, your uncle will be fine after drinking this bottle of 'God'. \"\n\nThe little boy was overjoyed, hugged the drink tightly in his arms, and rushed to the hospital excitedly. As soon as he entered the ward, he shouted happily, \"Uncle, I bought God back, and you will get better soon!\"\n\nThe next day, a medical team composed of the world's top medical experts came to this small city by special plane, went to the hospital where the little boy's uncle was located, and conducted a joint consultation with the little boy's uncle. Soon, the little boy's uncle was rescued.\n\nBut when the little boy's uncle was discharged from the hospital, he almost fainted again when he saw the exorbitant medical bill. However, the hospital quickly dispelled his doubts, saying that an old rich man named Bundy had paid for him, and the medical team was also found by Bundy with a lot of money.\n\nLater, my uncle learned that Bundy was a billionaire and that the grocery store was Bundy's ancestral property. He often came here to pass the time when he had nothing to do.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hC0ik0ccSqslNkScczwAd.png?height=1392&width=744)\n\nThe little boy's uncle was very excited, and immediately went to the grocery store with the little boy to thank him. The clerk told the two uncles and nephews that the boss had gone on a trip, so they didn't need to worry about it, and sent a letter written by Bundy to the little boy's uncle.\n\nThe little boy's uncle opened the letter: \"You don't need to thank me, young man, for everything, your nephew has already paid for it. What I want to say is that you are very lucky to have this nephew. To save you, he buys God $1 everywhere...Thank God he saved your life. But you must always remember that the true God is the love of people!\"\n\nThe story doesn't end here. Later, the little boy who bought God everywhere grew up and was admitted to medical school. In order to thank the billionaire Bundy who had rescued his uncle, and to help more people who were accidentally injured, he invented the Band-Aid and used it to Bundy is named so that everyone can remember his story and pass on the love.\n\nTherefore, we must believe that there are miracles in this world, and the most important factor for miracles to happen is sincere love! With sincere love in the world, difficulties will bow, miracles will happen, and the devil will escape.", "timestamp": 1658199516, "digest": "T6Q0jLCMVKlJIZsyqfozDzXvmREEhDaUROeS2ElSE9Y", "contributor": "0x0E2Dcd6E8f0F7843b544041546b8c6e85EFd71C2"}

NFT交易平台\n\n生态相对于DeFi应用，OptimismNFT和链游生态板块和NFT比较单薄，Optimism交易平台主要有3个：tofuNFT、QuixoticOptiMarket。\n\ntofuNFT 是链部署的 NFT 交易平台，Quixotic 是擎天柱的最大的 NFT 交易平台。\n\n四. Optimism的优势：头部项目和顶级投行支持、关键社区和生态发展\n1\\.头部项目和顶级投行支持\n\nOptimus 在开发过程中与 Uniswap 和 Synthetix 保持以太坊便利的项目合作。\n\n2019 年 10 月，Optimism 与 Uniswap 合作 Unipig Optimism Rollup 测试网，Unipig 是基于 Optimistic Rollup 发布的 Layer2 DEX 实验性产品。而 Uniswap 方面在 Optimism 网上主线前表示，将在 Optimism 上线时部署 Uniswap v3。\n\n22222200，Optimism与团队000资产组合Synthetix合作，而Synthetix随后将作为首创的扩容方案，将乐观主义作为合成交易平台产品交易的产物。\n\n支持这支股票，支持以太坊创始人，哈登·亚当斯和蒂克斯·卡因维克在以太坊生态道路上广泛支持他们在以太坊生态道路上的广泛传播和推广生态。\n\n2022月，Paradigm和IDEO便便了Optimism的种子领融资，B轮融资由a16z和Paradigm领融资。的加持，帮助其获得更多顶级投行的支持。\n\n1. 活动社区和生态发展\n\nOptimism 近期最大的代币活动就是发行OP，并分配19%的代币空投，以激励项目。\n\n在完成首轮空投后，Optimism 推出 2.3 枚 OP 激励基金，资助的项目可以发射 1 亿个 OP 的中亿建设和项目。数量之后，将向任何符合 Optimism 愿景的项目开放。获得 OP 的项目可以将 OP 分发给用户，激励用户使用部署在 Optimism 链上的应用程序。\n\n这两项措施激励用户和生态项目，能够有效将用户和项目引入生态。\n\n五。收入和估值\n\n1. 收入\n\n梅萨里的《乐观的价值》乐观主义的收入主要报告以下两个认为部分。\n\n①定序产生二上一用户的燃气费，生成在上一层，并在交易过程中添加上一上。目前收取的费用是提交上一交易的124%，预计存在交易量。美元的收入。\n\n②定序器未来可以提出一个最大可挖掘的价值（MEV）盈利，Optimism 用于 MEV 拍卖的系统，可以销售试点示范的 V 拍卖收入用于资助资助的产品。每年产生130万美元的收入。\n\nToken Terminal 数据，Optimism 最近 30 天的收入，按数据计算的年化收入为 2000 万美元。\n\n2\\.估值\n\nMessari The Value of Optimism》的报告中对乐观主义按市销售的总收入/收入的方法对乐观主义（Optimism）进行了比率。最终，认为OP的总美元是87.7美元，OP价格约2美元。\n\n根据Optimism的融资情况，Optimism在完成B轮融资后估值达到16.5亿美元。\n\n六。用户的肖像工作室：选择新公链还是以太坊Layer2\n以太坊市场面临的最大对手容量是EVMyer2链扩容，EVM1C、Ftom等量为20.3000亿BS。 ，Polygon去年锁仓量曾突破120亿美元。\n\n以太坊生态链应用同样直接支持以太坊智能迁移至智能合约迁移至，链上这些链上以智能代币如MAT、FTM加气费，这些链上支付电动车费用（一些）从应用、拖动应用。数量上比较，以太坊的扩容方式劣势。\n\n如何优化 Layer2 的用户体验，包括 Layer2 的优势是 Arbitrum、Optimism 在前面的Layer2 项目共同面临的主题。\n\nWeChat1：victeam005\n\nWeChat2：shijie20170405\nTelegream：<https://t.me/VICOINDAOCHAT>\nTwitter：@VICOINDAO", "timestamp": 1658199641, "digest": "LoLmrhSVkLDWGqLwAUl_zAVZCFlb-1qwgnxfQ_zMl4E", "contributor": "0xf6e546668c397dcb64767efe331904Ba147D5025"}

I have to admit: people who have been in love always have a deeper understanding of the hardships and sweetness of pursuing love than those who have never been in love. The first time I read \"La Traviata\" was in 2000, and that was when I couldn't understand the unforgettable true love and encounter between the son and the prostitute in \"La Traviata\", and I didn't have much sympathy for Margaret.\n\nAfter reading this again, there are two gains. One is to fully understand the crazy words and behaviors of men and women in love, and to understand the true meaning of true love. The second is to deeply recognize the cruelty and cruelty of the real society, and deplore the heroine's experience very much, and also hate the society that made her suffer this kind of experience.\n\nMr. Dumas' description of young people's love psychology and behavior is very delicate and true, which can evoke the warm and crazy memories of men and women who have long been numb in their marriages when they were in love.\n\nMr. Armand, a 24-year-old male protagonist who just graduated with the help of his parents, met a Parisian socialite by chance, a 22-year-old beautiful girl who was born in a poor village and had to come to Paris to seek a life. Grete, deeply attracted by her beauty and holy appearance, fell in love with her at first sight, and did not despise her because of her prostitute status, and insisted on meeting and dating according to solemn etiquette. Through half a year of anonymously caring and visiting the sick Margaret, he won the sincere love of Margaret, who was lonely and painful on the outside. However, because of the huge debt owed by Margaret because of the luxurious life in the past, she cannot be the mistress of several noble sons at the same time, in order to obtain funds to repay the debt and maintain the current decent life. This made Armand, who wanted to monopolize Marguerite's love but had no financial strength to save his beloved woman, was very jealous and bitter. He was helpless and complained about himself. He had many conflicts with Marguerite, misunderstood and hurt her many times, but soon Regret the pain and feel that Margaret should not be blamed. Men and women in love always hurt those they love.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xWKQFkMfVPtf-KyOYkD_m.png?height=420&width=640)\n\nMargaret understands love, her love is deep, she knows that loving someone is not only about taking and controlling, but also about tolerance and sacrifice. This stubborn girl's relationship with Armand has nothing to do with money, and she didn't ask Armand for a penny. In order to give Armand a pure love, Margaret made a huge sacrifice. After refusing to communicate with the old Duke and Count G and losing the source of funds, in order to repay the huge debt, in order not to put Armand's economic pressure, she resolutely bid farewell to the past. Living a life of luxury and beauty, Dian sold her carriage, diamonds, jewelry and furniture, and wanted to settle in the country with Armand through thick and thin.\n\nHowever, cruel society and secular prejudice will not allow a prostitute who pursues true love and is dedicated to goodness to become a new person. Happiness is always short, and suffering is always long. While they were planning a bright future in the Paris countryside, the fatherly and admirable M. Duval (Father Armand) came to Paris with worldly pressures to force the two to part. After being rejected by his son Armand, the old father found Marguerite. Our understanding girl, after realizing the painstaking care and pleading of her old father, made the decision to sacrifice herself to fulfill her lover - she painfully and deliberately communicated with the duke and the count again, and wrote a letter of refusal to reject Armand's request. Feelings, in order to achieve the purpose of causing Armand's hatred, despair and forgetting towards her. Armand, our heartbroken and desperate, lost his mind, bred hatred, and resorted to many measures, including making out and cohabiting with a prostitute in front of Marguerite, to avenge her \"betrayal of love\", let us poor girl She was severely mentally tortured to the point that she had to paralyze her soul through indulgence and alcoholism, which seriously damaged her already weak body. As a result, within three months, Armand, who she missed day and night, left Paris to go out to perform. During this period, poor Margaret died because of severe lung disease and coughing up blood.\n\nWhat touched me the most was: our tolerant and kind Marguerite, she did not blame Armand for misunderstanding and hurt her, she endured it silently, and she expressed all her affection for Armand in the writings she wrote when she was increasingly ill. in the diary. She told Armand: \"In those days you came up with something new to insult me ​​every day, insults that I could say happily accepted, because apart from the fact that they were proof that you always loved me, I seemed to feel The more you torture me, the more noble I will appear in your eyes when you know the truth.\"\n\nWhen Armand, who was traveling, returned to Paris to receive the news of Margaret's death and those deplorable diaries, he understood everything and deeply regretted his selfishness and recklessness. What a sighing story, what a touching love story. As the lyrics of \"Later\" wrote: \"Later, I finally learned how to love. It's a pity that you have long gone and disappeared into the sea of ​​people. Later, I finally realized in tears that some people will never stop once they miss them.\"\n\nIt is a little gratifying that our hero, M. Armand, is not as ruthless and indifferent as those aristocratic sons who have enjoyed Marguerite's body when they learn that she is seriously ill and has no entertainment value, but repents of herself. fault and try to make amends for the deceased lover. He traveled to Paris and Margaret's hometown while sick, and with the authorization of her relatives, he bought a permanent cemetery for the poor girl, and entrusted the cemetery administrator to buy a bunch of Margaret's favorite camellias to sacrifice to her every day.

{"id": "Evc3Eb9kZRPvKKPLItkyn3J0VI2yVibXN7kp3-0y_bU", "title": "An Overview of Coca-Cola's Entrance Into web3", "body": "## Overview\n\nCoca-Cola has an active web3 presence, and the brand is making a point to consolidate customer online experiences with their proprietary Coca-Cola app. The brand has a strong web2 presence, with philanthropy being a consistent theme with their Coca-Cola Give® portal. Sustainability, sports partnerships, and mental health awareness are three consistent themes through Coke’s brand style and storytelling.\n\n## Initiatives\n\n***Coca-Cola app (web2)*:** Coca-Cola app is a customer loyalty program to ‘unlock refreshing surprises and redeem rewards—all at your fingertips’. Customers primarily interact with Coke’s loyalty program through the *Coca-Cola* app for iOS/Android. Coca-Cola app offerings include scanning icons on Coca-Cola packaging to earn ‘rewards and access personalized experiences’. Customers can create their own custom beverage mixes via Coca-Cola Freestyle®, and can receive location-based rewards and offers at theaters and restaurants.\n\n**Coca-Cola Insiders Club:** Insider’s Club was a box subscription service that Coca-Cola tested as a service from January 2021 to March 2021. Each box featured three new or limited edition products before they hit shelves nationwide. Swag, and ‘exclusive virtual experiences with a celebrity’ were included with every box each month. The membership was paid upfront, with a 3-month subscription costing $45 plus tax and included free shipping.\n\n***The Friendship Box NFT*:** The Friendship Box NFT is Coca-Cola’s first foray into NFT web3 culture. On July 30th, 2021, four unique Coca-Cola NFTs were up for auction as a single ‘loot box’, for sale on Opensea.io. All proceeds for the sale went to Special Olympics International, a longtime partner of Coca-Cola. Auctioned as one lot, the collection features multi-sensory NFTs housed inside a ‘Friendship Box’. Coca-Cola’s Josh Schwarber explains, “The metaverse—which is borderless and ‘geo-less’—creates opportunities to connect with others like never before. We didn’t want to do this just to make an NFT. We wanted to inject the core principles of Coca-Cola and celebrate both our heritage and ties to friendship, while also doing something that hasn’t been done before.”\n\nThe Friendship Box acts as a dynamic loot box that contains the following:\n\n* Physical: The winning bidder received a real-life SMEG FAB28 Coca-Cola fridge, stocked with ice-cold Coke.\n* Digital: A custom-designed Coca-Cola Bubble jacket wearable, which included an unlockable version that can be worn in Decentraland. A Sound Visualizer NFT included the ‘unmistakable fizz of a Coke’ complete with visual effects. Lastly, ‘The Friendship Card’ refreshes 1948 artwork used in a set of Coca-Cola trading cards from the 1990s symbolizing friendship and refreshment. The metaverse-influenced iteration of the cards add motion, light and 3D features.\n\n**Coca-Cola Snow Globes:** Coca-Cola partnered with VeVe (a popular digital collectable app) to release a collection of Christmas themed digital collectables. This drop included the classic Polar Bear, Coke Bottles, Neon Coca-Cola sign, and a singular Coke bottle. Each drop had a different list price, rarity level, and number of collectables available to purchase. VeVe is being used to simplify the process of purchasing and using NFTs.\n\n**Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte:** Coca-Cola recently announced it is launching a gaming-inspired version of a virtual Coke beverage, surrounding the Coca-Cola Starlight release. The first video game it will be available in will be Fortnite. Coke has teamed up with gaming organization PWR to help with the creation of Pixel Point, a custom island built in Fortnite Creative. Fortnite Creative is a separate mode within Fortnite that allows companies and players to build their own custom worlds. Once players enter Pixel Point, they can try out coke-themed mini-games, as well as ‘try’ the new drink flavors.\n\n**The Coca-Cola Combo Burger Day Collection:** This International Burger Day (May 28th), Coca-Cola dropped more than 4000 free, unique digital collectables celebrating the classic combination of an ice-cold Coca-Cola and a burger hot off the grill. Every Coca-Cola combo comes in a mysterious red bag and inside each bag you’ll find a generative burger with varying traits to satisfy every taste, and a classic bottle of Coca-Cola Zero that goes with every single one. This release was as floppy as a barely cooked burger, with virtually zero traction or interest from anyone.\n\n**Coca-Cola Pride Collection**: The Coca-Cola Pride collection is a series of 136 digital collectibles made in celebration of the LGBTQIA+ community. The limited edition pieces feature an exclusive take on the iconic Coca-Cola bottle with artwork by Rich Mnisi, fashion designer and leading campaigner for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Africa. His commissioned design has been sliced into individual fragments and dispersed across all 136 collectibles, making each one unique. The collection aims to shine color-filled light on the LGBTQIA+ community's members and spread a message of Love. This collection was released on Polygon and currently has a low floor price and total volume.\n\n![Four different ways how not to release a branded NFT collection](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RSJZ07igKc1XkpGXT1qre.webp?height=767&width=767)\n\n## POS System\n\nCoca-Cola partnered with connectivity platform Omnivore to create a digital marketplace that makes it easier for customers to order Coke products through a Menu Management System (MMS) . MMS helps restaurant brands manage the complexity of numerous digital menus across online ordering, third-party apps, menu boards, kiosks, and more. MMS integrates the POS system, resulting in order injection, data collection, and control of content. This can allow for immediate pricing updates, deeper analytics, and easier surcharging.\n\nUSD is the only accepted currency on Coca-Cola’s website for US customers. Coca-Cola’s website allows for SSO via Google, Facebook, and Apple. The login for Coca-Cola’s website is the same as the app. Payment methods include traditional credit cards, Google Pay, and Paypal.\n\nAccepted payment methods:\nVisa\nMastercard\nAmerican Express\nDiscover\nPaypal\nApple Pay\nGoogle Pay\n\n## Discord Info\n\nCoca-Cola does not have an official Discord server.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\nEthereum self-custody digital wallets \n [Opensea.io](http://Opensea.io) NFT store (customers pay with ETH)\nRegular eCommerce payment portals\nMedium social media presence (Instagram, Twitter, TikTok)\nDynamic websites, utilizing CSS, JSON, and React JS\nUnknown how the iOS app was built or what tech it incorporates\n\n## NFT Stats (for Friendship Box)\n\nETH Contract: 0x455f04c9C54fFfa699e9F6b1271E857A1f2bDdfa\nBlockchain: ETH\nToken Standard: ERC-721\nCreator Royalties: 10.0% (Creator/Coca-Cola gets paid 10% of sales on secondary market)\n\n## Metrics\n\nBecause of the lack of data available from Coca-Cola’s NFT launches, Opensea’s Price History was used in favor of Dune.xyz. These metrics are included below. The metrics for more recent collections were so unimpressive and low (sub 1ETH total volume) that making a dashboard for the collections seemed like a waste of time.\n\n## Secondary Market Analytics\n\n(Secondary sales for Coca-Cola are the same as the original price of the only NFT sold traditionally on [Opensea.io](http://Opensea.io). The wallet that purchased the original Friendship Box NFT has not sold it yet.)\n\nCurrent floor price: 217.4541 ETH\nTop price: 217.4541 ETH\nAverage Price: 217.4541 ETH\nMedian Price: 217.4541 ETH\n\nPast 7 Day Volume: 0\nPast 24H Volume: 0\nPast 7 Day Sales: 0 NFT Sales\n\n## Virtual/In-Person Events\n\n* Coca-Cola has the World of Coca-Cola museum in Atlanta Georgia, showcasing the history of the company, as well as the Biedenharn Coca-Cola museum that serves as the original Coca-Cola bottling facility\n* On International Friendship Day, Coca-Cola sponsored a ‘can-top’ party within Decentraland that was available for anyone, regardless of owning a particular NFT\n* There have been no in-person events for NFT holders\n* In 2022, Coca-Cola hopes to incorporate more digital experiences into their brand, with their ‘Coca-Cola Starlight’ digital collectables\n\n## Brand Analysis\n\nStrengths\n\n* Has begun to embrace web3 and NFTs, using the latter as a way to promote its philanthropic ideals\n* Released two different NFT collections on two separate platforms ([Opensea.io](http://Opensea.io) and VeVe), which garnered considerable hype online and generated more interest in NFTs from non-crypto consumers\n* Hosted an event on Decentraland. Not NFT gated, but showing initiative and interest in the metaverse\n* Is capitalizing on the nostalgic nature of the Coca-Cola brand, through NFTs and social media\n\nWeaknesses\n\n* Coke has made a greater effort than other soft drink brands to dabble in web3, but could be offering a lot more given the sheer breadth of the IP. Every single release has been a flop\n* Needs a bigger tech team focused on NFTs and metaverse content to stay competitive and roll out new offerings quicker; Coke needs to stop releasing boring NFT collections\n* There are little to no notable utilities associated with the NFTs offered, and the only notable NFT offered was sold at a price that is entirely unaffordable and unrealistic for the average consumer\n* Little to no incorporation of the metaverse events or NFTs on the main website; no mention of web3 offerings on the Coca-Cola app\n* IP is interested in web3 but at this point has invested very little and is cautious to invest more time and energy into the space\n\nOpportunities\n\n* Is easily one of the largest and most successful companies in the world, with a brand so recognizable it is hard to think of anything more cemented in American culture\n* The first NFT launch was met with a ton of interest and bidding from ardent fans; Coca-Cola can recover from a poor launch in ways other brands cannot\n* Digital brands are eager to partner with Coca-Cola, and the brand is being selective on how they proceed in the market\n\nThreats\n\n* The lack of a Coca-Cola Discord server means that any comparable competitor could beat them in the social media space just by appealing to younger audiences\n* Other major soda brands could just as easily and quickly embrace web3. Nothing Coke has done is not replicable by other brands\n* The success or failure of VeVe as the established and primary online platform for digital collectables could sway Coke from pursuing NFTs more seriously. VeVe was exploited in March of 2022, with the in-app token being acquired illegally by hackers. This has caused increased skepticism of the long-term viability of the VeVe platform\n* Waiting for the right moment to embrace the metaverse more strongly just means another brand may take their place and gain popularity online-Repeated flops could turn long-term web3 investors away permanently\n\n## Summary\n\nCoca-Cola is a legendary brand that is beginning to embrace web3 and finding unique ways to incorporate it into its brand IP. Although Coke has been slow to roll-out new NFT and metaverse offerings, previous releases have been well received by the public and have not induced backlash. Coca-Cola Combo Burger Day and LGBTQIA+ releases were to practically zero fanfare, with some of the lowest floor prices seen for a major brand (consequently also on Polygon). The Coca-Cola app shows no signs of incorporating cryptocurrency or NFTs anytime soon, which could mean that full adoption for the brand is some time away. It is difficult to derive the metrics from Coke’s VeVe release, given the closed nature of the platform. With a solid IP and impressive annual gross profit, Coke can take the time it needs to decide how best to proceed in the web3 market.\n\nSocial Media\n<https://www.instagram.com/cocacola/>\n<https://www.tiktok.com/@cocacola>\n<https://twitter.com/CocaCola>\n\nReferences\n<https://www.thedrum.com/news/2019/06/26/coca-cola-creates-digital-marketplace-make-ordering-easier>\n<https://nftnew.net/2022/04/08/the-coca-cola-x-veve-partner-will-turn-the-starlight-flavor-into-nft/>\n<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/omnivore-partners-with-coca-cola-to-launch-digital-menu-management-solution-300852719.html>\n<https://medium.com/veve-collectibles/coca-cola-snow-globes-ddc7444b6789>\n<https://maketafi.com/coca-cola-nft>\n<https://etherscan.io/address/0x455f04c9c54fffa699e9f6b1271e857a1f2bddfa>\n<https://www.ledgerinsights.com/coca-cola-nfts-pride/>\n<https://opensea.io/collection/the-coca-cola-combo-burger-day-collection>\n\nNeed help with your web3 go-to-market strategy?

{"id": "lUpXpNjK3uJRZrAX5JhniCiDAZvv1ynf70tmMfUPXM4", "title": "\"Education of Love\" Reading Comprehension", "body": " \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OBTEB7R33mqhsviiHJdmz.png?height=500&width=364)\n\n When it comes to classics, I think everyone is familiar with them. The book \"Education of Love\" is a classic. After reading this book, my heart was deeply shaken. Love, like air, surrounds us all the time; love is a golden key to open our hearts; love is the bridge of gratitude between people; love is a vivid life textbook... The storyline of the book \"The Education of Love\" moved me very much. It seemed to make me suddenly understand that love is so sacred and noble. Love includes many things, ranging from the love of the country, society, and nation, to the love of parents, teachers and students, friends, and some even to strangers. The book \"Education of Love\" expresses \"love\" incisively and vividly, and is gripping and touching everywhere. Every plot in the book can give us a philosophy of love, allowing us to have a deeper interpretation and understanding of love. There is such a story in this book: when he came to school, a first-grade pupil suddenly left his mother's hand and fell on the street. At this time, the car was coming towards him. Seeing that the child was about to be run over by the car, Lopedi jumped over boldly and dragged him out. . At this time, Mr. Principal came. Lopedi put his head on Mr. Headmaster's shoulder, his face was pale and his eyes were closed. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bSWuzG8ayse5mG0STuV_t.png?height=700&width=525)\n\n(www.lz13.cn) After a while, a lot of people have gathered here, and they said in unison: \"Lopedi! How brave! Poor child!\" Yes, isn't Lopeti's great spirit of giving up his life for others and sympathy for the weak and the unfortunate, not worth learning from? From this, I thought of myself. Today, I did \"Have you been in love?\" \"Well, I did.\" In the morning, my mother gave me three yuan to go out for breakfast, and when I was walking on the road, I saw an old woman with shabby clothes and gray hair. He was begging for food with a bowl. I looked at her from a distance and saw the anxious, eager look in her eyes. I ran over without hesitation and handed the three yuan to the old woman, feeling a lot of relief. Although I didn't save a life like Lopedi did, at least the three yuan can solve the old woman's breakfast! Isn't that what \"love\" is in the world? It is like the scent of blooming jasmine flowers, bland but pleasant. Let's love, not only the relatives and friends around us, but also more people who need care waiting for us to love. Go love, as long as everyone gives a little love, the world will become a warm world! To love, as long as this sentence is our guide to action, the world will become gorgeous! Let's love, let's make an appointment with love, and make an appointment with famous novels!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qP2B7YrLpm1N12nGJ7VBq.png?height=755&width=600)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658200594, "digest": "HPgnonqxb0Zp8j6p8JoSJIIyFCSedn5UOtPknGCwKqM", "contributor": "0x0E2Dcd6E8f0F7843b544041546b8c6e85EFd71C2"}

As the network transitions from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in progress, the ETH staked on the beacon chain in the second quarter showed a growth trend; on the other hand, with the increasing popularity of PFP NFT, the average number of NFT daily active traders in the second quarter increased significantly, and the NFT transaction volume soaring, the \"bear meme\" led by Globlintown, has become the main driver of this round of NFT growth.\n\n### **Ethereum Ecosystem Revenue Reports Q2, 2022**\n\n* Protocol\n\n  Ethereum network revenue dropped by 33.4% due to falling demand for block space. EIP-1559’s new fee burning mechanism reduced ETH inflation by 37%. Beacon chain staking increased by 177.5%, due to increased integrations of liquid staking derivatives(LSD) into different DeFi Protocols.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dAk7D-rIHBC0kH1-7Z4UA.png?height=436&width=1520)\n\n* DeFi Ecosystem\n\n  The decline in user risk appetite caused DeFi TVL to drop by 42.4%. Stablecoin circulation supply increased by 43%, due to newly issued stablecoins, and increased trading or leverage demand. Perpetual DEX transactions increased by 598.5%, mainly coming from dYdX. Although the Luna incident and the market pressure brought about by the excessive leverage of institutions, Compound, Aave, and Maker have all withstood the test of liquidation, with a total liquidation of $460 million.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/smp-9iIZOyf3whZQJ50Dt.png?height=420&width=1434)\n\n* NFT Ecosystem\n\n  NFT market transaction volume soared 2439.2%, daily active users increased by 1114.5%, indicating increased PFP penetration; Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) floor soared 3844% — from 2.50 ETH to 98.60 ETH.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C9qNjtwpn6fLWbAsv6TEZ.png?height=366&width=1436)\n\n* L2 Ecosystem\n\n  TVL on L2 increased 896% from $374.17M to $3.72B.

This made me feel a little embarrassed, because I knew that my handwriting was not good-looking, not to mention that I hadn't written calligraphy for many years.\n\nMy friend said, \"What are you afraid of? I feel honored to hang your name. I am not afraid anymore. What are you afraid of?\"\n\nIn front of my friends, I unfolded the paper, polished the ink, and wrote the words \"I often think about one or two\".\n\nThe friend said, \"What does this mean?\"\n\nI said, \"It means that my handwriting is not good. If you see this handwriting, please bear with me, think about one or two things that are good for me, and then forgive me.\"\n\nSeeing my joking attitude, my friend said, \"What do you mean by being serious?\"\n\n\"As the saying goes, 'unsatisfactory things happen nine times out of ten', the unsatisfactory things in our life account for the vast majority, so living is painful. If we want to live a happy life, we must always think about the good things that one or two are, so that we will feel fortunate and know how to cherish them, and we will not be overwhelmed by the unsatisfactory.”\n\nWhen my friend heard it, he was very happy and went home with \"Changing Thinking One or Two\".\n\n2\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bHmXdME6kUAoHL0MreJ-p.png?height=294&width=391)\n\nA few months later, he came to visit me and asked me for words again, saying: \"I am tired and angry in the office every day, and I am very happy when I come home and see the picture of 'I often think about a thing or two'. But the walls are too big, and the words appear to be too large. Too small, you can write a few more words!\"\n\nFor good friends, I have always been responsive to requests, so I wrote the second couplet \"I don't think about eight or nine\" for \"I often think about one or two\", and wrote a horizontal batch of \"Ruyi\" on it, and I drew a freehand vase of flowers in the middle.\n\nUnexpectedly, after a few months, I was troubled by many bizarre legends and rumors. A friend called one day and said that he was sitting in front of the words I wrote in the living room, and he said, \"I can't think of anything to comfort you, so I will read your own words to you: I often think about one or two, don't think about it. Eight or nine, everything goes well!\"\n\nWhen I received a call from a friend, I was very moved. I often feel that it is easy to add icing on the cake in other people's festivities, but it is very difficult to help others in the misery. Those who can't help in the snow are not true friends, let alone those who fall into the trap.\n\n3\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6FVHp2Nc-anERvaO2KFuS.png?height=430&width=304)\n\nHowever, after a person reaches the age of forty, he has probably exercised the ability to \"not be frightened by humiliation\" in his life, and he will not care about the icing on the cake, the help in the snow, or the downfall. That is because we have already experienced the pain and setbacks of life, and we have also experienced many emotional encounters and separations, and we are slowly searching for positive, happy, and positive visualizations in our life. This kind of visualization is exactly the visualization of \"often thinking one or two\".\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w2TIfwQEFjiZDJH5H9_44.png?height=430&width=304)\n\nThe visualization of \"thinking about one or two often\" is to look for a ray of dawn in the heavy dark clouds; it is to open up some quiet news in the rolling red dust; it is to surface when you are on the verge of suffocation, and there is a deep breath .\n\nLife is already hard enough. If we add up the unsatisfactory events of fifty years, it will definitely make it difficult for us. Life and feelings are in misery, and sometimes it is helpless, but if even thoughts and feelings are in misery, it is asking for trouble and adding to the misery.\n\n4\n\nSince I was a child, I liked to read the biographies and memoirs of big people, and I slowly concluded a formula: all big people suffer, and their lives are almost the true testimony of \"unhappy things in life\", but when they face hardships They can also maintain positive thinking and can \"think one or two often\". Finally, they transcend suffering, and suffering becomes the most fertile nutrient for life.\n\nWhat moved me was not their suffering, because suffering is everywhere; what moved me was their perseverance, optimism and courage in the face of suffering.\n\nIt turns out that \"good luck\" or \"unsatisfactory\" is not determined by the fate of life, but by the moment of thought.\n\nIt turns out that it is not \"eight or nine\" that determines the quality of life, but \"one or two\".\n\nIt turns out that suffering is measured in quantity for those who fall into it, but becomes quality for those who transcend.

{"id": "aMAhvkVxP39PyPvKDMDlM_IrS83jg4Jz14kQg9W4WV0", "title": "The Count of Monte Cristo", "body": "\"The Count of Monte Cristo\" Throughout the ages, there have been countless popular novels in the world, but there are very few excellent works. Among them, Alexandre Dumas' \"The Count of Mount Chito\" can be said to be one of the best. The number of readers he has is a testament to his worth, and there is no doubt that The Earl of Mount Keto is one of the great examples of popular fiction. There are as many as 100 Alexandre Dumas novels, most of which are based on the real history as the background and the adventures of the protagonist as the content. The unusual ideal hero, the dramatic development of the storyline, the tense fighting action, the clear and clear complete structure, the vivid and powerful language, the flexible and witty dialogue and so on constitute the characteristics of Dumas' novels. The story is about an innocent man who is deliberately framed and wrongly held, but he takes revenge on those who have betrayed him with a well-planned scheme. Edmund Dantes, an active young sailor, is an honest and honest young man. But his peaceful life and his plans to marry the beautiful Mercedes were suddenly disrupted. Because his best friend, Fernand, also wants to marry Mercedes and has been cheating on Dantes. This \"good friend\", in order to frame Dantes, devised a trap together with Tangeral, who had a grudge against Dantes, slandering his connection with Napoleon, so that Dantes was taken by the police at the wedding banquet. He was wrongfully tried by Judge Villefort, who imprisoned him in the infamous Prison of Ifo Castle on the Isle of Ifo Edmund Dantes lived there for thirteen years of nightmares. However, during the period, he met the same old priest Faria who was framed. He learned a lot from the priest and launched his own enemies. With the help of Faria, Dantes planned and successfully escaped from the prison. He found the treasure left to him by Faria, and became a mysterious and wealthy \"Count of Monte Cristo\". With his wit and ruthlessness, he subtly squeezed into the upper class of France. He repaid his benefactors and made those who had manipulated and enslaved him pay a huge price step by step. When the revenge was over, he raised his eyebrows. Yuanfan, left France forever! Speaking of the features of this work, I think there are four most important ones. The first is the plot twists and the arrangement is reasonable. Generally speaking, successful novel tutors have twists and turns in plots and ups and downs, and Chidushan's Enmity and Vengeance is exemplary in this regard, and the novel attracts the attention of readers as soon as the novel opens. Edmund has just returned, young and promising, ready to get married, and acting captain, and has a bright future. It was his enemy, Tangeral, who was jealous of him, so he joined hands with his rival in a play, causing Edmund to suffer miserably, while the prosecutor, Villefort, put him in prison for protecting his father. This dramatic opening officially sets the stage for what follows. Later, Edmund's description in the black prison is even more impressive, and it is one of the most exciting parts of the book. Later, he actually cheated with the dead and escaped from the black prison. At this point, the readers hold their breaths, applauding the author's fantastic idea. However, this is only a prelude. Later he got the treasure and became a billionaire, the name is Earl of Mount Kedo. After that, it was his revenge. The novel is mainly about revenge. Dumas' ingenuity lies in the fact that the three revenges are written differently, each with its own interest, but it is also related to the occupation and criminal nature of the three enemies. And the different outcomes of revenge keep the plot from being rigid, making people feel full of changes, and readers can't expect such an ending. After reading it, and thinking about it again, there is indeed no better ending, so I can't help but admire the author's clever arrangement. Alexandre Dumas was not satisfied with the bizarre twists and turns of the basic plot, because the length of the story was too long, and only such a simple plot would still appear monotonous, so he interspersed a lot of thrilling scenes, such as the green forest hero haunting near Rome, using the carnival The festival carried out kidnapping activities; Madame Villefort poisoned people for her property, and Caderousse entered the Count's house to steal at night... The danger survived, with the artistic effect of peaks, twists and turns, and ups and downs, but it was not detached from the theme, Influence Center. This kind of big story set with small stories is just right. Every episode is very exciting and compact, and it serves the theme. For example, the expedition on the island written in the middle seems to have nothing to do with the theme, but it is The enemy's child, Albert... It is these little stories that make the plot complex but not sloppy, and it is only exciting to read, not boring. The second artistic feature of Monte Cristo's Enmity and Enmity is that it is bizarre and melted into one furnace. The novel touches on a wide range of society, ranging from the court of Louis XVIII, to the feasting and feasting of the upper class, to the gloomy and dreadful prison and the dark psychology of the prisoners, the robbers of the green forest, and the poor life of the citizens. description. The novel is by no means a sweeping scan of all social classes, but a certain depth of portrayal. For example, when describing the court, the author wrote in a few strokes the characteristics of Louis XVIII himself and his court fashion and the high society reception is even more wonderful and appropriate. He is also unique in his description of the lower society. His detailed description shows the prison life that ordinary readers do not know. Even the description of the inmates' discourse shows that the author also understands the scum of these societies. (www.lz13.cn) In addition, Alexandre Dumas's exotic writing is also very wonderful. It is the organic combination of this colorful society and exotic local customs that shows Dumas's broad vision and romantic artistic taste in a fusion of skills. This feature is also closely related to the legend of the novel. The third artistic feature is: complete structure and rich language. The structure of Jidushan's Enmity and Vengeance is very clear. The first half is a wedge, and it is this wedge that leads to the subsequent plot of revenge. Although the subsequent revenge plot is three clues, but they intersect each other, the narrative is methodical, the writing is interlocking, and the steps are in-depth. The author has achieved a strict, compact and clear structure in this article, and has produced a coherent effect. Alexandre Dumas is also very good at writing dialogues between characters. Eight-tenths of the whole story is made up of dialogues, but it does not feel rigid, but more fluent and natural. From the dialogue of each character, the character of the character can be seen. And even the narration of the past events is composed of dialogues, like the reappearance of the past events, vivid and natural. This is also one of the great successes of Monte Cristo's Vengeance. The last feature is: clear image and outstanding personality. I think it goes without saying that those who have read it will not forget those distinctive characters! Whether it's the old priest Faria or the Count of Monte Cristo, those characters are already deeply imprinted in your heart, aren't they? In a word, The Count of Monte Cristo is a good example of popular fiction. I think it is necessary for us to have a good taste. It will be of great help to our future writing and reading.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TK8wNGC4xy6X_VVXYB-C7.png?height=767&width=564)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658201344, "digest": "RETGrxTVqhs3Sg-9SaXXDv0Ww8AOeVZDpaTirmXl0fM", "contributor": "0x0E2Dcd6E8f0F7843b544041546b8c6e85EFd71C2"}

// 0.1 LINK (VRF使用费，Rinkkeby测试网)\n    }\n```\n\n**2. 用户合约申请随机数**\n\n用户可以调用从`VRFConsumerBase`合约继承来的`requestRandomness()`申请随机数，并返回申请标识符`requestId`。这个申请会传递给`VRF`合约。\n\n```solidity\n    /** \n     * 向VRF合约申请随机数 \n     */\n    function getRandomNumber() public returns (bytes32 requestId) {\n        // 合约中需要有足够的LINK\n        require(LINK.balanceOf(address(this)) >= fee, \"Not enough LINK - fill contract with faucet\");\n\n        return requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);\n    }\n```\n\n**3.** `Chainlink`节点链下生成随机数和[数字签名](https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTFSolidity/blob/main/37_Signature/readme.md)，并发送给`VRF`合约\n\n**4.** `VRF`合约验证签名有效性\n\n**5. 用户合约接收并使用随机数**\n\n在`VRF`合约验证签名有效之后，会自动调用用户合约的回退函数`fulfillRandomness()`，将链下生成的随机数发送过来。用户要把消耗随机数的逻辑写在这里。\n\n**注意:** 用户申请随机数时调用的`requestRandomness()`和`VRF`合约返回随机数时调用的回退函数`fulfillRandomness()`是两笔交易，调用者分别是用户合约和`VRF`合约，后者比前者晚几分钟（不同链延迟不一样）。\n\n```solidity\n    /**\n     * VRF合约的回调函数，验证随机数有效之后会自动被调用\n     * 消耗随机数的逻辑写在这里\n     */\n    function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness) internal override {\n        randomResult = randomness;\n    }\n```\n\n## `tokenId`随机铸造的`NFT`\n\n这一节，我们将利用链上和链下随机数来做一款`tokenId`随机铸造的`NFT`。`Random`合约继承`ERC721`和`VRFConsumerBase`合约。\n\n```Solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n\nimport \"https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTFSolidity/blob/main/34_ERC721/ERC721.sol\";\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBase.sol\";\n\ncontract Random is ERC721, VRFConsumerBase{\n```\n\n### 状态变量\n\n* `NFT`相关\n  * `totalSupply`：`NFT`总供给。\n  * `ids`：数组，用于计算可供`mint`的`tokenId`，见`pickRandomUniqueId()`函数。\n  * `mintCount`：已经`mint`的数量。\n* `Chainlink VRF`相关\n  * `keyHash`:`VRF`唯一标识符。\n  * `fee`：`VRF`手续费。\n  * `requestToSender`：记录申请`VRF`用于铸造的用户地址。\n\n```solidity\n    // NFT相关\n    uint256 public totalSupply = 100;

// 可mint数量\n        require(len > 0, \"mint close\"); // 所有tokenId被mint完了\n        uint256 randomIndex = random % len; // 获取链上随机数\n\n        tokenId = ids[randomIndex] != 0 ? ids[randomIndex] : randomIndex;

// 利用链上随机数生成tokenId\n        _mint(msg.sender, _tokenId);\n    }\n\n    /** \n     * 调用VRF获取随机数，并mintNFT\n     * 要调用requestRandomness()函数获取，消耗随机数的逻辑写在VRF的回调函数fulfillRandomness()中\n     * 调用前，把LINK代币转到本合约里\n     */\n    function mintRandomVRF() public returns (bytes32 requestId) {\n        // 检查合约中LINK余额\n        require(LINK.balanceOf(address(this)) >= fee, \"Not enough LINK - fill contract with faucet\");\n        // 调用requestRandomness获取随机数\n        requestId = requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);\n        requestToSender[requestId] = msg.sender;\n        return requestId;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * VRF的回调函数，由VRF Coordinator调用\n     * 消耗随机数的逻辑写在本函数中\n     */\n    function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness) internal override {\n        address sender = requestToSender[requestId]; // 从requestToSender中获取minter用户地址\n        uint256 _tokenId = pickRandomUniqueId(randomness); // 利用VRF返回的随机数生成tokenId\n\n        _mint(sender, _tokenId);\n    }\n```\n\n## 总结\n\n在`Solidity`中生成随机数没有其他编程语言那么容易。这一讲我们将介绍链上（哈希函数）和链下（`chainlink`预言机）随机数生成的两种方法，并利用它们做一款`tokenId`随机铸造的`NFT`。这两种方法各有利弊：使用链上随机数高效，但是不安全；而链下随机数生成依赖于第三方提供的预言机服务，比较安全，但是没那么简单经济。项目方要根据业务场景来选择适合自己的方案。", "timestamp": 1658201491, "digest": "p0ZSUNtH164_3q0aaE-iD51-5wAi_kHvLbiFV9mw20I", "contributor": "0x25df6DA2f4e5C178DdFF45038378C0b08E0Bce54"}

{"id": "ubNXrKJNFpfi_j4K0Y_px_w7qptPM9x2fzFvnCVwpeE", "title": "Danger of web 3 security risks", "body": "### New internet, new hardware devices, powerful security\n\nThe birth of the internet which is a new kind of technology in the 21st century has become a powerful tool ever created and brought into existence by man. It is a powerful tool because it has the ability to run from one planet to another planet with just a simple input by man.\n\nImagine the internet, that is web 3.0 as a black box or an emergency satchel like the one which the president of the United States is given to authorize a nuclear attack on another country farther away from its initial location. The internet functions that way but this time, one’s identity or codes can be secure for taking such actions.\n\nThe internet has become the mother and father of all technology because it has the ability and capacity to produce any type of value good or bad that can be consumed by the people who use the technology or internet. I consider the internet as a huge globe or universe but inside there are two small box-like planet both functioning identically though one is not secure and the other is secure for example web 2.0 and web 3.0.\n\nWhen the world is evolving or re-creating itself into something new, society always develops and creates something new that will function in that world or anything that goes hand-in-hand with the new world. For instance, web 3.0 is a new technology, but decentralized and therefore new hardware devices are needed for a decentralized technology. And I mean hardware devices that has a 5th generation technology standard and high connectivity to work with web 3.0 technology because the old devices may have malicious software which we are unaware of and therefore corrupting any input data or information as well as application that we may want to download.\n\nThere is nothing in the world that does not need security, living and non-living things has some sort of security that protects them from anything malicious likewise machines. Security is paramount. powerful security is gold. It is the only thing that can keep everything in place and secure. Web 3.0 is not just about NFTs, trade in the blockchain, but it is really about security. That means people who utilize this new technology can do whatever they want in that space while their personal identifiable information and data is secure and protected in the blockchain for example, the dark web.\n\n### Security and web 3.0 Vulnerabilities\n\nIt is impossible to build a world or a planet without putting strong foundational security in place otherwise everything that is built in the world or planet would crumble to the ground. Yes, technology is a powerful tool in the world but does not mean it has the best security in the world. Every new emerging technology that is built, and brought into existence always comes with all kinds of weakness or vulnerabilities.\n\nThe most powerful tool in the world that has the best security in place is the human mind. A strong mind has the ability to secure sensitive data and information within itself if it is properly guarded by whomever carries that mind, and builds a secure world from it’s mind free from weakness or vulnerability. How is this part of the paragraph related to web 3.0?, well we all know web 3.0 means decentralization therefore data must be decentralized and encrypted that only the owner has access to it. But sometimes we cannot 100% trust the internet, hence web 3.0 even though it is decentralized due to malicious actors and software in that space.\n\nThere is a misconception about web 3.0 which is that, because it is a decentralize technology therefore no malicious actors or hackers, scammers cannot steal sensitive data and information from anyone who ventures into the space of web 3.0. Unfortunately, that is a very wrong understanding because malicious actors can definitely steal data. Now let’s dive into the security risks of web 3.0 and provide some solutions how to better protect our data and information from bad actors.\n\n* **Social engineering**:- Of course adapting to the new internet or technology always open the way for exploitation and threat of social engineering therefore web 3.0 is no exception. Individuals who intend to explore or venture in the web 3.0 space must be extremely careful not to get tricked into providing sensitive information such as their secret recovery phrase, passcode, or any PII that can access their wallet or data. An example of social engineering is phishing attack where an attacker masquerades him/herself as a reputable person or company through emails. The solution here is never to share PII or secret recovery phrase when asked by anyone even an autobot through emails or text messages.\n* **Malware**:- Attackers can create their own malware such as a trojan horse which may distinguish as a legitimate software. And the attacker can implement the malware in any web 3.0 platform for anyone to mess around with it for example gaming, and music platforms. Another thing is attackers can deploy malicious smart contract onto the blockchain without anyone knowing he/she is signing onto a malicious smart contract because it does functions like a standard smart contract except that it is fake. It is important an individual verifies the source of the smart contract they would be signing by confirming the information written in the smart contract are legitimate.\n* **ENS**:- ENS here stands for Ethereum name service domain. I honestly never thought that cybercriminals could use the ENS to track an individual’s Ethereum address just by searching their simple names associated with their Ethereum address. Mr. Luis Monzon said it better when he wrote about the 5 most common security concerns for the web 3.0 world. He stated that, “*the growing popularity of digital currency has resulted in greater use of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains. ENS domains are an easy to remember name used to find the associated cryptocurrency wallet address. This has led to popular domain names being trademarked and resold by third parties. As a result, nothing prevents the owner of an ENS domain from using that name to trick unsuspecting users into believing that they are dealing with a legitimate organization*” I believe the solution in this case is owning your ENS that is associated with the wallet address and locking it in the blockchain with a private key.\n\nIt is concluded and noted that web 3.0 technology is still in the early age, growing, and fresh out of the womb of web 2.0 technology though a very interesting and exciting blockchain technology. The best thing about web 3.0 technology is that it gives freedom to creators to do whatever they want with their creativity, art, and intellectual property in the blockchain while the technology offers security with the input of our private keys because it is a decentralize machine. I believe that as the technology is growing, we will be experiencing more security risks in the future. Therefore, let us be ready to do more work to secure our data and information just in case those upcoming security risks present itself.\n\n### Reference\n\nMonzon, Luis. (2022, April 16).

{"id": "WqPaLaiMjPXDy0nLzVSBJSPgnCgOYj6zlVaR0xtT2Jw", "title": "What is immutable metadata and why is it important?", "body": "NFTs have a wide range of applications including:\n\n* personal IDs\n* collectibles\n* …\n\nRight now, collectibles and art are the main applications of NFTs. From the chart below, we can see how NFTs are performing in different categories.\n\n![Data Source: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/P3hfDsaOu_COjnwVW0HWx.png?height=646&width=1400)\n\nIn every category, NFTs represent ownership of an item. In the case of CryptoPunks, this item is a JPEG. For ENS, this is the .eth address and for Axie, this can be a game character.\n\n**The recipe for an NFT**\n\nAll of these tokens follow the same blueprint, part of those is ERC721 standard. This standard helps us distinguish between a fungible and a non-fungible asset.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CelNqtUraAfj9iU9G5sLr.png?height=700&width=1400)\n\nYou might have heard of the ERC1155 standard. It is an extension of an NFT. For our purposes, we can view both as tokenized digital goods.\n\nEvery NFT has a unique Id that points to its metadata, and it’s like a fingerprint for a digital asset. This metadata can consist of an image and attributes etc.\n\n**The anatomy of metadata**\n\nSo…what do we see when first looking at an NFT?\n\n![Data Source: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s5WU9uIpwsBx1CPIlQLjz.png?height=761&width=1400)\n\nThe name of the NFT is in the title.\n\nThis is the name that the project chooses for an NFT, after that, There’s the NFT’s unique ID marked with a “#”. This ID is the NFT’s fingerprint. Under the hood, in the [smart contract](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) a link is generated from this ID that points to some metadata about the NFT. We collect the metadata of every NFT from the blockchain and present it to our users. Here, you can see that this NFT has an image and some properties, the NFT’s metadata is like its ID card.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d3IlSUSQf_k6aIlWgoIy5.png?height=700&width=1400)\n\nIf you want to see the program that websites like us read from to collect this metadata, you can see it here:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/u3JtGCJv9OX4t_IjgMknH.png?height=913&width=1400)\n\nI will go over how you can find this raw data yourself. If you’re interested in that, stay tuned!\n\n**Where is the metadata stored?**\n\nA common misconception that people might have is that their NFT’s metadata is stored on the blockchain. This is true for some NFTs like CryptoPunks but it’s not best practice. On-chain metadata is highly gas-intensive and can cause even hundreds of dollars. In this article, we will cover the difference between on-chain and off-chain metadata and compare them.\n\nWe now know that most NFT projects don’t store data on the blockchain, so how do we make sure that our NFT’s data is immutable?\n\n**Immutability**\n\nWhen we say something is immutable it means that it can’t change. The $ETH you have in your wallet is stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, it is by nature immutable and no one can change it. This is a powerful phenomena that powers blockchain technology.\n\nHowever, we are not at the point where we can store all the data for an NFT on-chain just like we store our transactions. Achieving immutability is a challenging topic in the NFT development ecosystem. At [NFTGo.io](https://nftgo.io/), we ask two questions to see if an NFT’s metadata is immutable or not:\n\n* Is the metadata stored on a decentralized file storage?\n* Can the NFT’s metadata change?\n\n**The problem with mutability**\n\nSome projects take the road of storing their NFT’s metadata on a centralized database. This means that the owners of the database can change the metadata. There are other risks like:\n\n* Hacks and cyber attacks\n* Server problems causing the whole dataset to go down\n\nInvestors should be aware of these risks and realize that when an NFT’s data is mutable, it questions whether they truly own the NFT. Some projects have no choice but to store the data in a centralized way, we will go more in-depth about that in a future article.\n\n**NFTGo.io has made it easy**\n\nBefore, you should have done your due diligence to find out if your $100k NFT is really yours or not. [NFTGo.io](https://nftgo.io/)’s mission is to make the experience of buying an NFT as fluid and intuitive as possible. This is why we have the immutable tag on the NFTs that meet our criteria. This reduces the barrier to entry for new investors and makes old investors’ workflow smoother.\n\n![Data Source: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lA8ueK0iMUj3IibBzXWgh.png?height=700&width=1400)\n\n**Getting nerdy!**\n\nOur data is more than enough for most use-cases, but we’ll gonna show you how to find the raw data yourself. All of this work is already done for you by NFTGo.io. This is just for you to see what’s going on under the hood. If you’re curious, you can follow along!\n\nThere are four steps to this process:\n\n1. Go on Etherscan (or the block explorer of your choice)\n2. Find the NFT’s contract\n3. “Read” from the contract (I’ll explain what that means)\n4. Follow the URI you got back\n\nDepending on how the contract is structured, there might be more steps that you have to take after step 3 but this is pretty much the pattern for most of NFT contracts out there.\n\nFirst, we choose an NFT. On [NFTGo.io](https://nftgo.io/), we can see the ID of [this NFT](https://nftgo.io/asset/ETH/0xfc007068c862e69213dc7aa817063b1803d4e941/4744) is 4744.\n\n![Data Source: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/35ldzO2VyP8rnjnIS63SO.png?height=764&width=1400)\n\nIf you scroll down, you will see the information about the project under the NFT’s properties. There’s an address that takes us to Etherscan, this is the project’s smart contract. You can think of an NFT smart contract as a vending machine. When you click on the mint button, this vending machine will give you your NFT. There are other things that are going on in an NFT smart contract, more on that in the future!\n\nNow that we’re on Etherscan, it is important that the project’s contract is “verified”. On the right top corner of the contract, there’s a little green tick button. This means that we’re good to go. After you click on “contract”, you will see 3 options: code, read contract, write contract. Click on “read contract”, there are a bunch of different functions there, but we’re only interested in one of them. Find the “tokenURI” function (which is usually at the end).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tVEiKl3eejUy_8elk7F0D.png?height=633&width=1400)\n\nRemember I told you that an NFT’s ID is like its fingerprint. Well, that’s exactly what we’re going to use to get our NFT’s metadata. After you click on the tokenURI function, you can write the NFT’s ID in the input box. Click on the query button.\n\n![Data Source: EtherScan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RVUPQk11ze_hdEYzsP725.png?height=292&width=1400)\n\nAnd voila! You have “read’’ directly from the Ethereum blockchain. That was a lot of steps to get there, this is what our software does to get every NFT’s metadata.\n\nA big chunk of a blockchain’s task is to store data. Block explorers like Etherscan enable us to Read from the blockchain and also Write to it. Keep in mind that reading from the blockchain doesn’t cost any gas.\n\nIf you’ve clicked on the query button, you will see a response from the blockchain. This is a link to where the NFT’s metadata is stored, you can copy and paste this link on your browser. The page you see should be kind of familiar for you, we showed you earlier in this article the raw code for an NFT’s metadata. This text file is stored somewhere (centralized or [decentralized](https://golden.com/query/decentralized-file-storage-projects-BYY)) and that’s how we determine our NFT’s immutability.\n\nIf you see the link is pointing to a decentralized file storage, you can make sure that nobody has the power to change your NFT.\n\n**Key takeaways**\n\nIn this article, you learned a ton about NFTs and hopefully, the concept of self-custody makes more sense to you. You also saw how [NFTGo.io](https://nftgo.io/) has made it so easy for you to see if the NFT’s metadata is immutable or not. You also learned what’s going on behind the scenes. There are a few takeaways that I want to leave you with:\n\nBlockchains are open and transparent platforms and by leveraging the data from the blockchain, you can ensure the safety of your assets. However, it is inconvenient to use the blockchain directly every time. [NFTGo.io](https://nftgo.io/) bridges the gap between daily users and the blockchain. This is all made for you to have a safe NFT purchase experience.\n\nNote: The above information is for informational purposes only.

{"id": "uHzHmO2yRzM3kB6Cy7SG2SgP6-FN-8F1MCly3AopRS8", "title": "The rise of NFT DAOs", "body": "The dynamics of governance, democracy, and community formation are all fascinating topics to discuss. These topics merge in the concept of DAOs. With the rise of DAOs such as the constitution DAO. the potential for these organizations is vast.\n\n**The history of Crypto**\n\nBlockchains started with cryptocurrencies and revolutionized money. After the token boom, now the light of NFTs is getting brighter. Everyone is paying attention to the hottest NFT projects. NFTs power art, metaverse and digital identity. The concept of JPEGs selling for millions of dollars on the web might have seemed outlandish even two years ago, just like how peer-to-peer cash would seem odd before Satoshi created Bitcoin.\n\nWhat is the next wave in the blockchain ecosystem?\n\nWill history repeat itself?\n\nWhat is different this time?\n\nWe will explore these questions and more questions and concepts in this article.\n\n**What is a DAO?**\n\nDAOs are communities of people that collectively make decisions and vote for the future of the organization. By nature, these are autonomous and decentralized entities that are governed by the members. Many NFT projects can be thought of as a DAO, there’s a group of token holders together in a community that shares incentives. But the concept of a DAO can go way beyond just communities.\n\n**Why DAOs?**\n\nOut of all the ongoing efforts in the blockchain space, why do DAOs have the highest potential in pioneering the next revolution in blockchains?\n\nDAOs solve problems that have existed long before Cryptocurrencies, these include:\n\n* traditional organizations follow a hierarchical approach and decisions often are in favor of a small group\n* Transparent voting systems\n* Empowering the individual participants\n* The need for trusting third parties to be ethical and fair\n\nRather than following a hierarchical approach, DAOs aim to empower every person. DAOs are not controlled by anyone, they are **trustless organizations**.\n\nDAOs are the next revolution in blockchains because they are going after some of the hardest problems in human history: coordination and democracy\n\nDAOs have the flexibility and power to enter any industry. From shifting companies and communities to even governments, the potential for DAOs is vast.\n\n**The revolution sequence**\n\nRevolutionary technologies leverage the older tools and innovate to build a new tool. Isaac Newton famously said:\n\n“ If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants”\n\nWe can look at innovative technologies as sequential events that build up from the existing ones. Bitcoin and Ethereum built up from the internet and cryptography. NFTs built on top of Ethereum,\n\nWhat if the next generation of DAOs are powered by NFTs?\n\n**New paradigm**\n\nIn the past, DAOs have collectively come together to fund something or make decisions on the future of a protocol.\n\n[PleasrDAO](https://pleasr.org/#) famously took off when a group of NFT enthusiasts pooled together to make a million-dollar investment in an animation made by artist [pplpleasr](https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1).\n\n*“We live in a world where an ape just got elected to the board of a 9-figure DAO based on nothing more than his high school student council credentials and his love of NFT’s.*\n\n*What a time to be alive.[@PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) ✨”*\n\n— gmoney.eth (@gmoneyNFT) [June 23, 2021](https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT/status/1407508585458831360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nSince then, this DAO has collected and funded art pieces; they own the original Doge NFT. The initial investment was at around $2M.This NFT was then fractionalized and turned into DogeCoin. The DAO decided to make an ERC20 token backed by this NFT. The token is #12th in [coinmarketcap’s rankings](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/) across other cryptocurrencies.\n\n[PleasrDAO](https://pleasr.org/#) has just scratched the surface of what is possible when NFTs merge with DAOs.\n\nAs DAOs start to enter new domains, there’s a need for infrastructure and tools for managing the organization.\n\nNFTs have been used as a form of identity and have proven to be successful in that domain. By leveraging NFTs, all DAOs can manage users. This idea can be extended further if we start to think about the NFTs having attributes such as voting power etc.\n\nOther than the general application of non-fungible tokens in the DAO space, there are use-cases specific to NFTs and collectors that we can explore.\n\n**NFTs + DAOs = ?**\n\nDAOs are shaped by mutual ideas. Pleasr DAO showed us the power and value that can be created by a community of like-minded NFT enthusiasts. But this idea can go beyond collectively collecting NFTs.\n\nDAOs can fundamentally change the way NFT projects and artists start. Today, most NFT projects (with exceptions) start from an already existing media company or self-funded artists. This limits the spread of NFTs and soon, NFTs can suffer from centralization risk.\n\nGoverning the future of NFTs should be in the hands of the creators and contributors. DAOs empower the investors and creators by giving them a voice in the community and control over the direction of NFTs.\n\nThis is a stark contrast to how NFTs are currently created and sold. Communities don’t go beyond an exclusive Discord chat. The decision-makers are in a centralized company or a small team and supporters are not getting the maximum reward possible for being early adopters.\n\nWhen the power of deciding for the future of NFTs is in the hands of people, the possibilities are unlimited. This was proven by us when months ago [The Loot Project](https://nftgo.io/collection/loot-for-adventurers/overview) started. The project gave control to the community and is powered by the collective creativity of the community. Loot is now clocking at 7th place in NFTGO’s rankings with over a $160M market cap.\n\nAlthough there have been efforts to create “pseudoDAOs” in the NFT space, the possible implications of an NFT focused DAO is still open to discussion.\n\n**Social experiments**\n\nAfter disrupting centralized governance strategies, DAOs are moving to social networks. The promise of Web2.0 was an interactive and distributed application. Early on, this was an exciting moment for everyone. We’re way beyond those times and centralized social network providers are starting to show their flaws. From Facebook changing the result for the US election to Twitter suspending out-spoken people, more than ever, there’s the need for decentralized protocols to step in and make the unbounded social networking experience possible.\n\nIn theory, blockchains are capable of transforming social networks for the better. Though in practice, many of the solutions are still experimental.\n\n[Monaco](https://monaconft.io/) is one of the emerging decentralized apps that is experimenting with decentralized social networks. They bring the same feelings of Twitter but in an NFT native social platform. For using the app, users have to own the project’s NFTs.\n\n![Image Source: Monaco](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zighx9_kSUEfVO1m9BMy5.png?height=743&width=1400)\n\nA more DAO-focused social app is [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/). Entering the DAO requires a written application which will be reviewed by the members of the community and a certain amount of their ERC-20 token.

So, tried those with additional money to eventually lose it all. \n  \n I started buying BTC around $10k area and ETH around $200 in end of 2019/early 2020 but dumped it all at more than 50% loss in the March 2020 covid dump. \n Apart from that started shorting bitcoin with some BTC thats left with me from $6K which got liquidated around $10k. \n  \n After that deposited more USD and started shorting btc with USDC which got liquidated at $20K and finally thats where I stopped leverage trading. \n  \n And I didn’t stop there as usual bought bunch of alts around May 2021 top which got dumped more than 80% and the cycle continues. \n  \n Now I no longer sell any assets that were down 90-99% instead just hoping for a mega alt season like 2017 whenever it happens hopefully before early 2022 so I can atleast make it all back what I lost with some more profits so I can keep continuing in crypto space. \n  \n My sincere advice to new people in crypto to not over invest and try to learn some basic technical analysis where you can use High Time Frame levels to enter/exit trades and don’t keep fomoing for every small move in Low Time Frame. Also, better start buying in bear markets when volatility is low and keep an eye on new trends. Also, try to interact with new protocols which could earn some airdrops in bull market.", "timestamp": 1658202405, "digest": "_cDfnBeUzdtbHcWL_Io_XF6B-DJBR-XpWw1K0zTTkzI", "contributor": "0xfbdc0e9522c9d8d40438d2C247Bfa43DD5915864"}

{"id": "MgZO9tfH6uu5AIE8_fO57miLsq5295445D0dWSkhmUM", "title": "How To Make An NFT: A Beginner’s Guide", "body": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have exploded in popularity over the past few years, with prices for these tokens skyrocketing as collectors scramble to obtain rare and unique collectibles for their digital wallets.\n\nNFTs differ from traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin because NFTs are tied directly to unique digital assets. While anyone can use cryptocurrencies to transfer - or trade - any fungible asset (one that has no differentiation), NFTs can only be used for trading one-of-a-kind assets.\n\nThis means that nearly anyone can create their own NFTs to represent unique digital assets, whether they are games, collectibles, or something else entirely.\n\nIf you are lucky, it can also mean that your NFTs will be worth a significant amount of money if the asset they represent becomes popular.\n\nAre you ready to start trading? Here's how to get started:\n\n## Step 1: Choose Your Asset\n\nThe first step to making your own NFT is to pick an asset. The asset that you turn into an NFT can be nearly anything: a digital music album, a 3D model of a character, an access pass to an event, or even real-world items like stocks or gold bars. Below is the value share of each category, you could also have a basic overview of different categories.\n\n![Data Source: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EekOR41mBOFcMlVvu0fnX.png?height=946&width=1656)\n\nAs you brainstorm possible NFTs that your project could represent, remember that the best collectibles are unique and rare.\n\nIf your asset is too common, it won't be valuable because anyone can easily create an NFT to represent it, and no one will want to buy yours.\n\n## Step 2: Determine Your Token's Function\n\nThe next step is to decide how you want your NFT  to function within its network. To do this, you'll need to think about:\n\n* How people will interact with the NFT (what functions it will be able to perform).\n* How other projects can interact with it (how your NFT  can interact with others).\n\nMuch of this will depend on the blockchain network you want to host your NFT on.\n\nFor example, if you'd like your token to be used within a decentralized game, it's important that users can use the NFT to generate and store in-game currency. Otherwise, players won't have a way to purchase or collect resources.\n\n## Step 3: Set Up Your Wallet\n\nYou will need to have a digital wallet to store your NFTs once you start trading. You can quickly set up a wallet and load it with cryptocurrency on a number of different platforms, including:\n\n* [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)\n* [AlphaWallet](https://alphawallet.com/)\n* [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/)\n* [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)\n\nOnce you set up your wallet, make a note of your wallet address. You'll need this later to create your NFTs.\n\n## Step 4: Register As An Owner Of The Asset\n\nTo create an NFT, you will need the private key for the wallet that represents the asset you want to tokenize.\n\nYou can then head to an NFT marketplace to “mint” your NFT on the blockchain. You will need to register your wallet and then follow the steps to register your NFT properly.\n\nEthereum and Ethereum-based NFTs are widely available, but if you're working with a different blockchain platform, you may need to do some research on the best marketplace for your asset.\n\nSome of today's top NFT marketplaces include:\n\n* [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)\n* [Axie Marketplace](https://marketplace.axieinfinity.com/)\n* [Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/)\n* [Rarible](https://rarible.com/)\n* [Binance NFT](https://www.binance.com/en/nft/home)\n\nEach marketplace appeals to different buyers and sellers, and as such, you will want to choose one that has a strong track record and meets your requirements.\n\n## Step 5: Set Up Your NFT\n\nWhen you register with an NFT marketplace, you will be asked to enter some information about your NFT  function, the numbers, and the dates.\n\nYou'll also need the address of your wallet (which you made in Step 3) and the private key for that wallet (which you made in Step 4).\n\nUpdating your NFT is as simple as visiting the marketplace, uploading your NFT’s information, and updating its metadata. You can then list it on your marketplace of choice to start trading immediately!\n\n## Step 6: Put Your NFT Up For Bid\n\nSome makers simply want to create and display their NFTs without trading, but if you want to start buying and selling your NFTs as quickly as possible, you can list them on an auction.\n\nThese blockchain auctions work in a similar way to real-world auctions. When you put your NFT up for bid, it will be sold to the highest bidder when the auction ends. You will then receive the winning purchase price in cryptocurrency minus the marketplace's transaction fees.\n\n## Step 7: Celebrate Your New NFT Success!\n\nCongrats, you are now a creator of NFTs!\n\nOnce you set up the process the first time, creating and minting new NFTs is simple. You can create as many as you want, and you can use your project to explore new business models, test out existing ones, or even create games with blockchain-powered currencies.\n\nNow that you know how to create NFTs, you can add them to your digital wallet. Get started today, and learn how to create NFTs that can benefit you and your business in the new digital marketplace.", "timestamp": 1658202613, "digest": "fs36urd7WKki-eOpd2J7GibCKSdVAbYq7_fO7Ke2XPk", "contributor": "0xFE0dfc1662E5836F49ad5686A93525efB37Ef818"}
{"id": "7_5ZfAIq1CYNQhr12Ru-htvFEYzrIlDz_WhGwyemdAE", "title": "I am decided now... right?", "body": "As I was wandering in my mind during this trying times, I could recall that all I thought I didn't knew, indeed I used to knew it. So you may think, why didn't you realized it early? That one is an easy one: for so many, the obvious is not that much obvious sometimes. Let me explain it to you a little bit.\n\n## The beggining of the knowing\n\nI am now in my 30s, but everything started in my early 20s, when I started to structure myself as a TradFi guy (even though, I am still kinda one of those). The stock market, the financial risks, the banking and above all, the money, was the most important concepts I wanted to know for sure.\n\nSo, the internship in a brokerage I got by winning a kind-of-a-nerd-writing-contest for a well known regulator institution in my country, just gave the perfect opportunity to start with the knowing of those delicious financial concepts.\n\nBonds, stocks, investments, pricing, interest rates, were the first glares of knowledge I started to absorb. And of course, those concepts were addicting. The job enviroment was not the best, but of course I was young and that didn’t matter at all (now I know that indeed does).\n\nAs little I knew back then was the most important things that could ever happened to me. Why? Because the unknowns knowns of that time were the source of the curiosity I used to absorb everything.\n\nThen, 2 years later, the thirsty curiosity for new unknowns knowns was the main reason I dare to quit. But, of course, I didn’t quit at random. There was another kind-of-a-nerd-writing-contest from where, once again, I won an intership. This time in a risk assessment firm. Touché.\n\nThose new juicy financial risk concepts were the new mainstream in my life. The way that those unknowns knowns were filling my not-so-much-shy knwoledge, let me introduce to myself to a new understanding of the human behavior: we are not that much good at finance and overall, at using money.\n\n## The knowing\n\nBy that time, the now well-known book ***The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness*** was not even thought to be published (as far as I know). So, I didn’t have a broad understanding of why we do the things we do with our money. What a shame.\n\nWrapping up my thoughts and meaningful chatter inside my head, I was able to notice that I might know something that could be useful for my sorrounding people. So, I started to ask questions. Some questions not well received, some others very smile answered.\n\nThen, I knew it. I was meant to be the “learner” but in a different way. The good old way: learning-by-teaching way. So I decided to begin to teach some of the core concepts of what I was ripping my head off these last couple of years.\n\nBut as you might already realized by yourselves in your own life, the also ***well-well-know*** Impostor Syndrome came to action. And yes, it was so much devasteting as yours maybe. So, I did quit. But this time it was a resounding quit.\n\nI didn’t want to know about sharing anything to anybody. Why? Simple because I was ashamed of myself and my lack of encourage. So, a couple of years must have to passed to enlight to myself the last piece I needed to know.\n\n## The last knowing\n\nAfter all the effort, all the thirst for knowledge for financial concepts and all the experience gathered during my starting days, the concept finale was missing.\n\nAnd it was so easy to realize about it.\n\nA self, non centralized, type of money was the answer for it: bitcoin. And as simple as that all the crypto-bro world came to me. Bitcoin at first, Etherium second and all the crypto ecosystem was the last knowing I did want to know. I was hopping down the rabbit hole.\n\nIt was scaring to start learning about what was missing in my knowing path. Because, of course you are scared of stuff. Even more if that matter is what you like the most. You want to nail it. But, how? (I think I already answered that, but here it comes).\n\nSo, yes, I am learning. I will keep doing it. I already know so much enough than the common individual using *fiat*. And I am grateful for that. I will come back to teach to my people once again.\n\n## The deciding\n\nAs I write these words, I am scared, but decided. I will come back like never before, knowing I know my unknowns, thirsty for new knowledge, but now focused on DeFi concepts and all the crypto ecosystem.\n\nWith crypto, all my desires for knowledge are being fulfilled. And becoming a cliché learner-by-teaching individual is the way.\n\nI am decided now to teach about crypto and DeFi. And I think I made that clear… right?", "timestamp": 1658202878, "digest": "L6dIX-X-MVYlqg5mitzJUX1Fm2gOlbgYJ0_SFxQqDMg", "contributor": "0x69fcc58B05Dcb614D90B129A7218608bC313a4F4"}

ApolloFi will continue to make disclosures related to tokens, and we previously discussed token migration. Now, we will attempt to provide a broader overview of the migration process.\n\nWhy migrate?\n\nApolloFi is the first multi-chain network platform, we have launched the LayerZero to bulid the 3 chains, such as Ethereum, Polygon and BNB chain.

{"id": "RR_SF27WU3pfWArHbtGdz58UzWTH6R2VEXhGb3deX-g", "title": "Real-World Benefits Of NFTs", "body": "## Introduction\n\nThe world of NFTs does not revolve only around art and collectibles. It spans across various categories, and each NFT undertakes a value based on a multitude of things.\n\nNFTs can be created for purely artistic or collectible purposes, or they can be assigned a certain application when created, providing a tangible utility. Some widely implemented applications for NFTs today take the form of access such as memberships to private clubs/groups, voting power towards future developments of collections, early announcements for airdrops or new artists’ releases, etc.\n\nThe NFTs market is what has made the concept of a futuristic metaverse boom over the past few months. Nearly Every virtual world being created is now releasing most of its products (avatars, land, items, etc.) in the form of NFTs, mostly due to the proof of ownership feature and the versatility provided by smart contracts. This upcoming sector has also provided a new utility for many collections, driving up the adoption rate of NFTs altogether.\n\nAside from the aforementioned applications, NFTs have a great potential for a wide variety of sectors through their possible utilities. Some sectors in which NFTs could bring innovation to are real-estate and mortgage contracts, insurance coverages, luxury goods, event passes, and id cards.\n\n### Big Brands’ Appearance in the Metaverse\n\nSince 2021 the adoption rate of NFTs has skyrocketed thanks to the involvement of prominent public figures. Through them, various industries and major companies also noticed the steady sector improvement, the metaverse’s wide array of possibilities, and the innovative features of NFTs, and are quickly following suit.\n\nA few examples of such industries and companies include:\n\n* Clothing industry companies, such as Adidas and Nike, have made their appearance in the metaverse by launching or acquiring NFT collections and buying land lots in virtual environments dedicated to exposing their digital merchandise in branded stores.\n* GameStop is planning to launch its marketplace. It partnered up with Immutable X and together gathered a fund of  $100 Million to support the marketplace creation.\n* Walmart filed seven different applications for trademarks before the end of 2021. Most of the trademarks revolved around the creation of a proprietary token made to purchase Walmart goods in the metaverse, hinting at the imminent appearance in the market.\n* Microsoft recently acquired Activision Blizzard, the gaming company, for a staggering price of almost $70 Billion. One of the first comments made by the CEO of Microsoft was NFT related, as he stated that this deal would “provide building blocks for the metaverse”.\n\nThese market moves made by big companies to join the NFT and Metaverse environments are some of the overall pictures. Such widespread approval from big companies has been an important factor for the NFT industry. Their entrance into the market is currently laying the foundation for a possible widespread wave of innovation, across various industries. The presence of major companies might also reshape the way the NFT market is currently conceived. It will force some improvements in some areas, such as IP frauds and copyright infringements, and it will provide more stability to the industry overall due to the financial backing provided by the aforementioned companies.\n\n### NFTs with Utility Today\n\nAside from the utility coming from big corporations’ investments, it is also worth looking at some of the most successful collections within each market category and checking out what utility they have provided through their NFTs to gain such traction in the first place. By looking at the broad spectrum of NFT categories it will be possible to cover the most known utilities and applications across the market. The analytical tool of NFTGo provides a clear breakdown among collection categories and good data visualization, therefore it will be used as a source for the collections’ data.\n\n**DEFI**\n\nThe Decentralized Finance sector merged with the NFT sector for utility purposes. The possibility of having a token with proof of ownership through the blockchain provided the DEFI sector with features that satisfied the requirements needed to issue collateralizable assets, loan guarantees, and even LP positions in the case of Uniswap V3.\n\n[The Fortune Teller collection](https://nftgo.io/collection/fortune-teller-collection/overview) is a perfect example of an NFT collection with sole utility purposes since each token is a warranty for a loan itself and their unique prices are tied to max loanable amounts.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ay-2qHtTe8OtlZMqFmJiR.png?height=610&width=1150)\n\n![Data Source: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xjnnrk-AG5KrAJs4uP-H8.png?height=264&width=1196)\n\nAlong with the Fortune Teller collection, the Uniswap V3 Positions collection is also composed exclusively of NFTs with a specific utility towards the owner. In the case of Uniswap Positions, each NFT represents the position an investor takes when providing liquidity to a liquidity pool on the Uniswap platform. This provides the secondary option of having a Non-Fungible token to represent the position instead of a Fungible one as seen in previous versions of Uniswap.\n\n![Data Source: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PB1fIZy57VyDlRYEITf2C.png?height=442&width=1890)\n\n**Metaverse**\n\nThe Metaverse is a category that has incrementally been providing more and more utility options for NFTs as assets to each specific digital environment. [The Sandbox Assets](https://nftgo.io/collection/the-sandbox-assets/overview) collection on the Ethereum blockchain has been one of the leading metaverse assets collections in regards to market cap and daily trading volume. The unique tokens available in this collection represent a wide variety of disposable items and assets for the digital environment of the Sandbox. The 3D models for sale range from avatars, to weapons, all the way to completely furnished properties.\n\n![Data Source: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eUxWg0rwC6aIZanidEtaD.png?height=392&width=1730)\n\nSimilarly, the [Somnium Space VR](https://nftgo.io/collection/somnium-space-vr/overview) collection has made a name for itself within the metaverse category with its NFTs representing items, such as land and avatars, to be used in the Somnium Space virtual reality world. The token’ type is for the majority land plot-related, which brought some of the NFTs of this collection to be the highest sales within the metaverse category. The NFTs representing land plot property have proved to be one of the highest-selling metaverse utilities.\n\n![Data Source: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PtFug-kkVyUeYOIAiCosG.png?height=364&width=1588)\n\n**Music & Sport**\n\nOver the past few months, both the Music and Sports industry dived into the NFT market and the resulting collections brought to light new utilities and applications. The most common one is collectibles tied to athletes or artists, along with a wide variety of smaller utilities and benefits tied to being an owner of a specific collection.\n\nThe example that best represents both the music and the sports industries is the Autograph collection created by the American football player Tom Brady. The collection is tied primarily to the Polygon blockchain, making it unavailable to see it through NFTGo. The market cap is difficult to estimate, but they received $170M in Series B funding. The collection’s utility revolves around the involvement of famous figures across various fields (such as Sports, Music, and Entertainment). To date, it is seen as a collectibles type of collection, but as it is stated by Autograph themselves, along with the value of a signed piece of digital memorabilia, other experiences related to the famous figures represented in the tokens will be added to the list of ownership’s benefits.\n\n**Collectibles & Passes**\n\nGary Vee is an entrepreneur and famous internet figure. He was one of the most outspoken supporters of the NFT revolution from the beginning and launched an NFT collection called VeeFriends in May 2021. His role as an entrepreneurship advisor, life coach, and internet personality complemented perfectly the utilities assigned to the tokens of the VeeFriends collection. While the [VeeFriends](https://nftgo.io/collection/veefriends/overview) NFTs represent for the major part access to Gary’s community, depending on the rarity, they could represent tickets for conferences, access to one on one meetings, and unique possibilities tailored to the investors’ interest.\n\n![Data Source: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qIEG5MS2cY9YZc-JCFwo5.png?height=340&width=1564)\n\n**Utility**\n\nAlthough NFTs with utility has been the driver of this piece and their features have been looked at in many different market sectors, the notable mention within the NFTGo category “Utility” would be the [Slotie NFT](https://nftgo.io/collection/slotie-nft/overview) collection. This collection was created to bring the Casino experience to the blockchain. An NFT carries not only access to the Casino network behind the collection but also benefits in over 150 Casinos worldwide. In this case, access to the Casino community is the main utility, but each NFT also provides different rewards possibilities within the Slotie supported platforms.\n\n![Data Source: NFTGo.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I6uYxsPjE5gcLNNhiOE9u.png?height=516&width=2096)\n\n## Wrap up\n\nAfter looking at various examples of what certain utilities could be for upcoming NFTs and what utilities certain NFTs already provide, it is clear that there is a steady strive towards improvement and great interest from investors. The collections aforementioned were some of the first to find their intriguing utilities to pair with the right market niche, and have managed to increase the base value of their NFTs through meticulously planned fund management, properly executed market campaigns, and well-thought-out experiences and utilities to offer. The incoming wave of big brand recognition and investments in the NFT sector will increase the overall value of the market, increasing the competition for the existing collections, while simultaneously making it a richer industry. Possible utilities for NFTs and existing NFTs with a set or dynamic utilities will be two key topics to keep an eye on while this wave is taking place to make informed investments.", "timestamp": 1658203337, "digest": "AohEQVy1RQiQk09cwro2LyHfxG5304e6x7p5a25GjYc", "contributor": "0xFE0dfc1662E5836F49ad5686A93525efB37Ef818"}

{"id": "_nn-DEmUES076RTleB_BDQmtqiLnpuCdyOuvkuXBmoM", "title": "BTC&ETH继续放量 资金达到阈值 Q2财报开始陆续释放 — 2022.7.19", "body": "当前总结：从目前的宏观形势来看，仍然是处于情绪带动的时期。即便是ETH的大涨也没有带来根本性的变化，资金面依然是处于短缺的情况，抛压依然是不少，只是相对来说资金更加的集中了，确实BTC和ETH的成交量在继续保持上升，尤其是ETH的成交量相比上周五直接翻倍。但对于外部资金却没有更大的变化。\n\n造成这种现象的原因除了情绪上的FOMO以外，还有通胀见顶的预期让更多准备抛售的筹码开始观望，但毕竟目前的涨幅还未引发大规模资金波动，而随着周内美股第二季度财报的即将披露，势必会对美股和币市产生影响，所以数据上可以发现从昨天美股开盘后链上的波动就在开始增加，尤其是BTC更多转入进交易所。\n\n这并不代表更多的筹码开始抛售，而是未雨绸缪，如果头部科技股的业绩良好势必会带动整体币圈的继续上涨，转入到交易所即便不卖也可以随时做好准备，毕竟还有不到十天就公布加息了，而一旦情况不好也能第一时间离场，所以近期交易所的BTC数据在持续上涨，这并不是明显利好，而且更加与带动购买力上涨的ETH不同。\n\n而目前的ETH如果按照汇率来说，甚至还尚未回到今年五月的数值，也就是BTC30,000美金时候的汇率，而这也是在LUNA事件后的汇率。从这个角度来看，目前的ETH只是将超跌的部分补回，当然这依旧是因为合并带来的情绪上的利好，而接下来的走势势必还是情绪上的带动，能走多远也必然受到宏观情况的限制。\n\nTwitter @Phyrex_Ni\n\n截止到今天早晨八点的BTC持仓价格分布，从昨天晚上美股开盘前到现在的BTC链上地址变化可以清晰的看到，相比昨天同期链上的波动有所增加，主要的原因还是得益于上涨的价格，连续的上涨让更多的投资人解读为比较强势的反弹，BTC在最近一周也走出了超过10%的涨幅，尤其还是在高CPI的情况下。\n\n所以更多的BTC在这种明明是熊市利空，但价格却不降反升的情况下纷纷转移进入交易所，来防止盘面的突然转向，从两边的极端价格来看，远古持仓的筹码波动加大，更多获利筹码变更了链上地址，甚至转移进入了交易所，毕竟相比亏损筹码来说，获利BTC的煎熬更加的严重，随后就是美股财报的出炉和加息落地。\n\n提前转入交易所有助于规避涨跌上的风险。而高位套牢的BTC除了在58,000美金有单一价格的较大规模转移外，整体依然是维持着低波动，可见目前的价格对于长期持有者那怕是亏损持有者带来的吸引力都不够大。而相比起来，22,000美金上方的整体亏损筹码的减持在几个个别价格放量的情况下产生了较大的变化。\n\n但通过数据的交叉对比可以发现，这些相对集中的临近价格的大幅减持很有可能是交易所地址的互项转移，尤其是用于从冷钱包给热钱包提供的提现筹码。而随着BTC价格的持续上涨，堆积量已经逐渐的脱离高堆积的危险区域，当前19,000美金到20,000美金区间的堆积量已经从220万枚BTC开始跌落。\n\n但如果价格不能维持在22,000美金的上方，那么20,000美金附近的BTC又会重新开始堆积，毕竟现在说“只涨不跌”还言之过早。抛压的主力依然是来自于当前的争端价格，而且获利筹码的减持也没有明显的放缓，这也说明投资者并不完全看好接下来的走势，毕竟随着更多数据的出台，通胀见顶也越发产生动摇。\n\n从截止到今天早晨八点转移到交易所的BTC数据来看，目前的抛压已经来到了近期非极端行情下的高点，而这么大的抛压下价格还能持续的上涨，要么就是资金量在大幅的提升，要么就是更多的筹码转入交易所后并没有着急出售，而是选择观望。从细节数据可以看到，更多的转移量还是从美股开盘后开始一直到现在。\n\n从截止到早晨10点的情况来看，上涨的动力已经稍显不足，毕竟目前经过了美国主力资金时差的变化，现在处于相对资金短取的时候，价格的下浮也是在所难免的，更加重要的还是要看今天下午15点左右的资金量，面对盘面的下跌，欧洲人的选择格外的重要，而今天开始科技股也会陆续开始公布第二季度的财报。\n\n而且通过转出交易所的提现数据可以发现，相对于高涨的抛压，转出的BTC就相形见肘，已经连续多天转出量无法覆盖转入的抛压，从而可以知道更多的转入而尚未影响价格的原因就是在在于更多的筹码处于观望，而不是购买力层面的提升，这也说明即便情绪上在看涨，但实际上资金却不愿意下场。\n\n从细节的转出数据也可以看到，即便是最近24小时都处于高转出的局面，依然无法阻止更大的抛压出现，当前已经到了从情绪面升华的关键期，如果可以进一步FOMO带动更多的资金入场，盘面依然可以维持震荡上行，而一旦看涨的情绪出现疲惫，近期的获利筹码就会加速悉数离场。\n\n可以说从今天开始，每一天都在崩盘的边缘游走。\n\n而当前ETH 的情况则又不一样了，虽然和BTC同样都处于非极端价格下的高抛压情况，但是ETH的购买力则在持续的增加，并不像BTC一样更多的筹码担心价格反弹见顶而选择滞留在交易所观望，而ETH则更好理解，毕竟合并最早的预期也要到九月中下旬，给了足够的FOMO时间。\n\n而早期在BTC30,000美金情况下就有大量的BTC切换到了ETH，而现在切换回来甚至还有少量的币本位增幅，所以暂时并未出现价格见顶的预期。但不得不重申的是，目前宏观层面尚未发生变化，即便是有合并的利好，目前的ETH依然是在情绪层面的看涨，即便引动了更多的资金也难以提前两个月就走出独立行情。\n\n从昨天下午18点以后的细节数据来看ETH的主要抛压还是来自于两个方面，一个是欧洲和美国的主力交易时间的23点至凌晨2点，另一个是今天早晨的7点到9点，而购买力的提升则发生在早晨7点以后，尤其是9点后达到了高潮，疑似亚洲的资金在大量的购买ETH。有趣的是中文环境下反而是更多的看衰ETH的合并。\n\n而且ETH在交易所的存量也在逐渐的减少，虽然还没有恢复到LUNA时间后的低点，但减少的抛压也让上行的通道更加的通畅，从细节数据可以看到，尤其是在上午9点30分Gemini出现的大量购买后，交易所的存量ETH大幅减少了超过10万枚，是继Coinbase之后再一次的大规模减持。\n\n从整体的资金层面来看，USDT虽然依然处于低位，但是相对前两周来说也有了少量的提升，总算是没有辛苦ETH的拉升，但是单从USDT的转入资金量来看，相对于2021年2月ETH在1,700美金并且处于上升阶段的资金量来看，差距还是相当的明显，所以如果单纯从USDT的层面来看，持续上升的可能性太低了。\n\n不过USDC在昨天确实爆发了，不但是转入交易所的资金量有了大幅的提升，甚至是在交易所的成交量都几乎达到了翻倍，更多的USDC通过交易所转换成了USDT下场购买，这其中最大的原因还是因为USDT的汇率已经顺利的回归，市面上几乎已经看不到USDT的FUD，闹剧终归是阶段性的收场了。\n\n结合USDT和USDC的总数据来看，目前的资金量正好符合ETH在2022年上升时候的资金总量，这就说明如果宏观上可以进一步的推进资金的入场，那么ETH的上升通道是符合资金趋势的，说人话就是只要当前的情绪不发生变化，资金量不减少，维持目前的资金体量将ETH价格提升到2,000美金问题不大。\n\n但如果想继续上升就需要宏观层面的支持，但是起码从现在来看，宏观情况还没有发生任何的变化。\n\n而从BTC的永续合约层面上可以看到，资金费率虽然是继续处于较强的看多情况，但是看多的基数尚不足以满足支撑BTC的形势发生逆转，目前的资金费率还没有到0.01，而如果要想出现持续的大规模上涨，最起码也要在0.03的上方，可见目前的差距还是很大的。\n\n从宏观层面来看，美金指数继续在107的上方徘徊，这也是因为昨天出炉的NAHB房产指数不及预期的原因，房地产（包含租赁）本身就是CPI的重头，远低于预期的数据让通胀派扳回一局，目前通胀见顶的言论又受到了挑战，甚至昨天晚上美债的殖利率普遍突破了3.1%，果不其然，接下来就出现了资金进入美债的情况。\n\n而受到非农以及政府宣讲的美国经济尚未衰退的影响，本身已经跌破100美金的两油又回到了100美金的上方，尤其是拜登出访沙特并没有获得预期中的支持，只是两油的价格还有继续上涨的空间，所以八月的通胀从目前来看依然不容乐观。而一旦出现通胀同比或者环比反而上涨话，那么这一波也就结束了。", "timestamp": 1658204171, "digest": "LQEG6QB3EpRaLpYyJR8YyOR7VmFfySjcglze6pDtxHE", "contributor": "0xdDa424d9bB3140bE68b0AAadCaf7CADf7c36A046"}

{"id": "yjuG7sxzphpYddw8evMP2TJCZnXiM4gRbw0XvNxc4Jc", "title": "一文读懂Web3金融科技版图：从支付到财务管理，有哪些项目值得关注？", "body": "*撰写：Bisolaa*\n\n*编译：TechFlow intern*\n\n在过去的十年里，金融科技，即 FinTech，一直是传统金融服务公司运作方式创新的主要驱动力。它颠覆了从支付处理到预测和预算的一切，催生了我们今天所知道的一些金融科技创业巨头，例如：Stripe, Deel 和 Brex。\n\n受@qwqiao Web3 创业想法的启发，我深入研究了一些 Web3 中的金融科技初创公司。下面的版图覆盖了近 50 家提供金融科技解决方案的初创公司，兴许投资者和创业者应该对此加以关注。\n\nWeb3 作为一种新的原语，标志着范式的根本转变，这意味着我们无法将 Web2 中的传统金融科技工具复制和粘贴过来。将法定货币换成加密货币，将银行账户换成钱包，将有限责任公司换成 DAO，这些都是为了支持这一阶段的创新而产生的一类新的金融应用。\n\n因此，我们看到历史正在重演，在 Web3 领域，金融科技如何继续推动更大的价值。在这篇文章中，我将描绘出 Web3 金融工具的景观，并强调为什么它正在迅速成为投资者和创业者看重的下一个令人兴奋的前沿领域。\n\n![4339159769dcc73481adcc99187847e.png](https://www.techflow520.com/storage/u/image/20220719/1658204115560074.png)\n\n### **出口与入口**\n\n当 Web3 正在重新构想一个新的财务世界时，法币的出口与入口（On & Off Ramps ）是一种常用的连接虚拟与现实的桥梁。\n\n它提供了一种便利的方式，可以直接将银行账户中的法币转化为钱包中的代币，帮助用户探索去中心化网络中的应用程序，并进行互动。\n\n**On & Off Ramps 是一个最基本的基础设施，如今已迅速成为许多人进入 Web3 中使用的第一个金融科技工具**。\n\n项目举例：@moonpay、@RampNetwork、@GetOnramper、@transak_\n\n### **支付网关**\n\n随着加密货币已经确立了自己作为数字货币的一种形式，**支付网关（Payment Gateways）是用户使用加密货币进行消费的门户**。\n\n他们使商家能够接受加密货币作为一种支付形式，从而让客户获得商品或服务。\n\n支付网关是将商业从法定货币转移到加密货币的一个关键组成部分，它为买家和卖家提供了一个无缝交易的方式。\n\n项目举例：@CommerceCB、@BitPay、@CoinPaymentsNET、@cryptocom、@UTRUST、@CoinGatecom、@binance、@cheq_xyz、@TheGivingBlock\n\n### **支付协议**\n\n通过移除中心化实体，用智能合约替代，支付协议（Payment Protocols）是最纯粹的加密货币支付网关。\n\n它们使商户和他们的客户之间能够进行真正的无许可商务活动。\n\n支付协议是中心化网关的一个去中心化的替代方案，将商业从法币转移到加密货币。\n\n项目举例：@loopcrypto_xyz、@Superfluid_HQ、@UnlockProtocol、@DiagonalFinance、@BtcpayServer、@dripsnetwork、@0xSplits\n\n### **NFT 结账**\n\n鉴于其固有的稀缺性和艺术性，**NFT 已经成为数字经济中任何参与者彰显其所有权的必备品**。\n\n专门的 NFT 结账（NFT Checkout）是一种无摩擦的方式，买家可以用信用卡或借记卡购买 NFT。\n\nNFTs 可以代表从证书到社区成员的一切。鉴于其重要性，NFT 结账为用户提供了一种更简单的方式来获取它们。\n\n项目举例：@papercheckout、@moonpay、@winter_NFTs\n\n### **薪资和费用管理**\n\n随着 Web3 作为一个行业的不断发展和成熟，**薪资和费用管理（ Payroll & Expense Management ）成为链上劳动力管理的关键组成部分**。\n\n它帮助链上组织简化财务运作，使他们能够支付贡献者和承包商，以及管理以加密货币计价的费用。\n\nWeb3 改变了工作的本质，一个加密货币原生的工资和费用管理解决方案是帮助组织在这个新世界中运作的关键。\n\n项目举例：@utopialabs_、@RequestFinance、@parcelHQ\n\n### **财务管理**\n\n随着具有共享银行账户的在线社区以 DAO 的形式扎根，**财务管理（Treasury Management）试图解决如何进行单个账户管理的问题**。\n\n利用财务管理，组织能够通过多样化和其他方式帮助管理其链上资产。在线社区由资产的共同所有权定义，财务管理是确保其可持续性的先决条件。\n\n项目举例：@0xCoinshift、@llamacommunity_\n\n### **支出管理**\n\n随着越来越多的公司向数字化转型，**法定货币不再是首选货币，支出管理（Spend Management）必须支持多币种的新形式**。\n\n该工具可帮助跨越 Web2 和 Web3 之间界限的链上组织，管理他们在法定货币和加密货币方面的支出。\n\n鉴于一个组织可以同时持有多种加密货币，支出管理正在发挥着越来越重要的作用。\n\n项目举例：@multisHQ\n\n### **会计和报告**\n\n组织的财务活动必须在某种程度上从区块链调和到现实世界，**Web3 原生的会计和报告（Accounting & Reporting）是首选工具**。\n\n链上组织可以使用它们来跟踪从代币交换到 NFT 铸造的所有链上交易，跨多个区块链以确保合规性。\n\n即使在一个新的数字世界中，参与者的交易也必须被跟踪和核算，因此，会计和报告成为一种必要。\n\n项目举例：@cryptio_co、@Coinbooks_、@GildedFinance\n\n### **税收**\n\n作为生活中两个确定的因素之一（死亡和税收），**即使是身处在数字世界中，税收（Tax）也是不可避免的，这并不奇怪**。\n\nWeb3 原生税务应用被消费者和企业用来跟踪加密货币投资组合和交易，从中可以计算出资本收益、所得税等。\n\n凭借其数千种加密货币，以及独特的机制，如质押，链上税务应用是这一复杂步骤的解决方案。\n\n项目举例：@koinly、@TokenTax、@TaxBit、@CoinTracker、@bear_tax、@blockpit_io、@accointing、@Coin_Tracking、@tax_tris、@CoinLedger、@ZenLedgerIO\n\n### **商业情报**\n\n由于向新计算范式的转变，链上组织催生了链上商业情报（Business Intelligence）的需求。\n\n**情报平台的功能是处理区块链数据，供 Web3 原生组织使用，以推动高质量的决策**。\n\n对可操作的洞察力的需求随着公司进入链上世界，商业情报是呈现这些洞察力的必要工具。\n\n项目举例：@DuneAnalytics、@nansen_ai、@gauntletnetwork\n\n随着现有应用程序越来越不能满足他们的需求，我预测将会有更多的 Web3 金融科技应用创新出现，一些我很想看到的解决方案包括：\n\n**●KYC** ——随着 \"了解你的客户\"（KYC）日益成为 \"了解你的钱包\"（KYW），欧盟的法规给中心化交易所带来了负担，要求其收集未托管钱包的信息，或阻止向其转账。我预测，这将扩展到去中心化的应用程序中，如果某些钱包是已知的恶意行为者，将被阻止与 dApp 进行交互。我们已经看到这种情况发生了，Tornado Cash 使用 Chainalysis 的预言机合约来阻止 OFAC 制裁的地址。由于 dApp 被迫满足更高的监管标准，一个 KYC API 服务对于开发者来说是必要的，可以整合到他们的应用程序中来处理整个监管负担，这样他们就可以专注于他们的核心产品。\n\n**●订阅管理和计费** ——随着加密货币成为消费者越来越受欢迎的商业工具，目前的计费模式仅限于一次性付款，而基于数量和循环性的商业模式等还没有出现替代方案。针对加密货币的订阅管理和计费工具将作为商家的解决方案出现，不仅使他们现有的商业模式从 Web2 转移到 Web3，而且还帮助管理和协调两种货币类型带来的订阅数据差异。\n\n**●采购** ——去中心化组织的无许可参与是一种超能力，但会导致协调问题，特别是在采购工具方面。DAO 采购工具通常以非标准的方式发生，组织内没有明确的责任利益相关者可以出售。鉴于我期待的 DAO 工具将成长为一种特定的应用，即服务和投资不一样；采购管理应用对于足够大的 DAO 来说将成为一种必要，确保它能获得适合其目的的最佳工具。\n\n随着金融活动继续向链上转移，Web3 中的金融科技将变得越来越重要。这个版图为企业家和 VC 提供了一个出发点，让他们开始思考这一新兴类别。\n\n[原文连接](https://bisola.xyz/fintech-in-web3-a-landscape)\n\n***深潮 TechFlow 是由社区驱动的深度内容平台，致力于提供有价值的信息，有态度的思考。***\n\n> ***社区：***\n>\n> 公众号：深潮 TechFlow\n>\n> 订阅频道：<https://t.me/TechFlowDaily>\n>\n> 电报：<https://t.me/TechFlowPost>\n>\n> 推特：[@TechFlowPost](https://twitter.com/TechFlowPost)\n\n*进微信群添加助手微信：blocktheworld*", "timestamp": 1658205429, "digest": "z6ST6vbQLTAqdEFhf5bfWudNN8FYXPNSvxIZOsTA7Fg", "contributor": "0x0E58bB9795a9D0F065e3a8Cc2aed2A63D6977d8A"}

***“Universal name service network”*** ที่จะทำให้สามาถเชื่อมต่อ ผู้คน, ข้อมูล, สินทรัพย์ และ แอพพลิเคชั่นต่างๆ บนโลก Digital เข้าด้วยกันโดยที่คงไว้ถึงความ Decentralized และเปิดเผยข้อมูล\n\n## ทำไมต้อง universal name service\n\nสาเหตุสำคัญที่ทำให้อินเตอร์เน็ตเป็นที่เฟื่องฟูขึ้นมาก็คือการที่ผู้คนสามารถปฏิสัมพันธ์กันดังนั้นผู้คนเองก็ต้องการที่จะทำให้เรามีตัวตนขึ้นมารวมทั้งยังต้องการให้ตัวตนของเราเป็นที่รู้จัก เช่น มีชื่อของเราปรากฏบนตารางอันดับต่างๆ, บนหน้าต่างแชท, จำนวนเหรียญในกระเป๋า หรือ NFT ที่มี พวกเขาเหล่านั้นต้องการให้ชื่อของตัวเขาเองเป็นที่รู้จักจากผู้คน ไม่ใช่เพียงแค่เลขรหัสกระเป๋า แต่เพื่อให้ทั้งหมดนี้ทำงานได้อย่างมีประสิทธิภาพ เราจำเป็นต้องมีสิ่งที่สามารถยืนยันตัวตนของเราอย่างเป็นสากลที่สามารถใช้งานได้ทุกๆ เชนซึ่งนั่นก็คือ universal identifier นั่นเอง\n\nซึ่งในปัจจุบันนั้นเรามีการยืนยันตัวตนที่ค่อนข้างหลากหลายทั้งชื่อตัวของเราเองหรือตามแต่ละแพลต์ฟอร์มที่เราใช้งานไม่ว่าจะเป็น อีเมล, Twitter handle หรือ address เป็นเชนต่างๆ\n\nการที่มีสิ่งที่สามารถยืนยันตัวตนแบบสกาลนี่เองจะช่วยให้ dApps ต่างๆ สามารถทำงานได้ดีมากขึ้น ซึ่งทำให้ ***SPACE ID (SID)*** จะเป็นมากกว่าแค่ชื่อ แต่จะกลายเป็นตัวตนของเราใน Metaverse ไม่ว่าจะเป็นการ แลกเปลี่ยนคริปโต, ให้ยืมโทเค็น, mint NFTs, ซื้อตั๋วต่างๆ หรือแม้กระทั่งอาจจะซื้อบ้านในอนาคต โดยที่ทั้งหมดใช้เพียงแค่ ID เพียง ID เดียว\n\n## สิ่งท้าทายสำหรับการให้บริการ Domain Service ในปัจจุบัน\n\n* ถูกจำกัดอยู่ในเฉพาะ เชนของตัวเองเพียงเชนเดียว\n* ปัญหา Zero-width issues\n* สิ่งที่เชื่อมต่อ Blockchain ต่างๆ เข้าด้วยกันยังขาดความเป็น decentralization\n* ระบบการลงทะเบียนค่อนข้างซับซ้อน\n* ยังมีการนำชื่อแบรนด์ของ Domain มาผสมกับชื่อผู้ใช้งาน\n* ยังยากที่จะนำไปใช้งานร่วมกับ protocol ต่างๆ\n* จำกัดเฉพาะบริการ Name service เท่านั้น\n\n## แก้ปัญหาต่างๆ ด้วย SPACE ID (SID)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1260/1\\*YV10WJiEotZ1KJvFxqnd4g.png)\n\nSPACE ID เชื่อว่าการระบุตัวตนบน Web3 จะกลายเป็นสิ่งสำคัญในการเชื่อมต่อระหว่างตัวตนของเราในโลกความจริงและโลกดิจิตัล ดังนั้น SPACE ID จึงพยายามที่จะนำปัญหาต่างๆ ที่บรรดาผู้ให้บริการ Name Service ยังพบเจอในปัจจุบัน มาเป็นกุญแจสำคัญในการพัฒนาฟีเจอร์ต่างๆ ของ SID\n\n## Feature 1: Universal Domain\n\n### สร้างแบรนด์ของเราเอง\n\nแน่นอนว่าในอนาคตเรากำลังมุ่งไปสู่การใช้งานบนหลากหลายเชน ซึ่งผู้ใช้งานไม่น้อยเองก็อาจจะประสบปัญหาที่ว่าชื่อที่เราใช้งานบนบล็อคเชนประจำอาจจะถูกแย่งจดทะเบียนไปแล้วในบล็อคเชนอื่นๆ ทำให้เราสูญเสียตัวตนหรือแบรนด์ในชื่อของเราเอง ด้วยการทำงานของ SID ปัญหานี้จะหมดไปเพราะว่าชื่อที่คุณได้จดทะเบียนไว้จะเป็นชื่อที่เฉพาะของคุณในทุกๆ เชน\n\n### รูปแบบชื่อที่เหนือกว่า\n\nชื่อโดเมนในปัจจุบันเช่น .eth หรือ .com ส่วนใหญ่แล้วเป็นเพียงโปรโตคอลที่จบเพียงแค่ให้บริการ name serviceแต่ SID นั้นเป็นมากกว่านั้น เนื่องจากเป็นการให้บริการชื่อหลากหลายเชนได้ ทำให้ โครงสร้างในการทำงานจึงจำเป็นต้องแยกโดเมนระดับบนสุด (Top-Level-Domains) ออกจากชื่อโดเมนของผู้ใช้งาน ด้วยการใช้ ***“:”*** XX: สำหรับ Top-Level-Domains และ\\*\\* :XX\\*\\* สำหรับผู้ใช้งาน\n\n### ลดความซับซ้อน\n\nสำหรับ SPACE ID ในกรณีที่ผู้ใช้งานได้จดทะเบียนชื่อว่า Allen ดังนั้นในทุกๆ เชนชื่อผู้ใช้งาน :Allen ก็จะถูกใช้งานบนทุกๆ เชนเช่นกัน เช่น :Allen บนเชน BNB, :Allen บนเชน Ethereum หรือ :Allen บนเชนCosmos.\n\n### การเชื่อมต่อตัวตน\n\nSPACE ID ยังสามารถทำคุณเชื่อมต่อข้อมูลของคุณจาก Web2 อื่นๆ ได้เช่น Twitter Handle, อีเมล หรือ บัญชี Github ของเรา\n\n## Feature 2: การปรับแต่ง Top-Level-Domains\n\n### ชื่อเฉพาะของคอมมูนิตี้ของคุณ\n\nถึงแม้เราจะมี universal name ของเรา ต่ก็ไม่ได้หมายความว่าเราจะไม่จำเป็นต้องมีข้อมูลตัวตนอื่นๆ ของเราในคอมมูนิตี้ต่างๆ จึงทำให้ Space ID พยายามที่สร้างฟีเจอร์ที่สนับสนุนในการปรับแต่งโดเมนระดับบนสุด (Top-Level-Domains) ได้ในรูปแบบเช่น “BAYC:” หรือ “ETH:”ซึ่ง TDL นี้ก็ะเทียบเท่ากับ .eth ในปัจจุบัน\n\n### รวมระหว่าง NFT และโดเมนเข้าด้วยกัน:\n\nยกตัวอย่างง่ายๆ สมมุติว่า BAYC ต้องการที่จะแจก airdrop $APE เพิ่มให้กับผู้ถือ NFT ซึ่งสิ่งที่ BAYC ต้องทำก็คือทำการกระจาย $APE ให้กับโดเมนย่อย BAYC:XX ทุกคนเท่านั้น โปรเจคไม่จำเป็นต้องมานั่งค้นหาว่าผู้ถือใช้ชื่อโดเมนจดทะเบียนว่าอะไร ทุกอย่างก็จะถูกส่งให้กับผู้ถือ BAYC:XX\n\n### การรวมกันของ Top-Level-Domains และ เชนต่างๆ\n\nมีประโยชน์มากมายจากการรวม TLDs เข้ากับ การให้บริการบนเชนต่างๆ ยกตัวอย่างเชน หากชื่อที่ถูกจดทะเบียนผ่าน SID ไว้เป็น :Allen ดังนั้นชื่อของ Allen ก็จะสามารถตั้งค่าได้ตามนี้- BAYC:001- ETH:Allen (allen.eth)- BNB:Allen (allen.bnb)- และถ้าหากใน Twitter ชื่อ handle ของเขาใช้ชื่อว่า @Allen เขาก็สามารถ ใช้งานชื่อ Twitter:Allen ได้เช่น\n\n> ***และเมื่อถึงวันที่ทุกสิ่งสามารถนำมารวมกันได้ ผู้ใช้งานก็อาจจะสามารถส่งเหรียญคริปโตต่างๆ ข้ามเชนได้เช่นส่งจาก Solana ไปยัง .bnb domain***\n\n## Feature 3: One Software Development Kit (SDK) for All\n\n### ความรวดเร็วในการใช้งาน\n\nหลังจากที่เปิดให้บริการแล้ว SPACE ID จะไม่ได้ให้บริการฟีเจอร์นี้กับผู้ใช้งานปกติแต่จะเป็นฟีเจอร์สนับสนุนสำหรับบรรดาพาร์ทเนอร์ต่างๆ ซึ่งจะเป็นการช่วยให้สินค้าการให้บริการของ SPACE ID สามารถเข้าถึงผู้ใช้บริการหน้าใหม่ได้ง่ายขึ้นและยังการทำงานของ SPACE ID SDK ยังใช้เวลาสั้นๆ เพียง 30 นาทีเท่านั้น\n\n### การจัดการรวบรวม Name service \n\nการใช้งาน SPACE ID SDK ไม่เพียงแค่ใช้เร็วเร็วง่ายดายใน 30 นาที แต่การที่ SPACE ID ให้บริการในส่วนของ TLD ด้วยนั้นก็จะทำให้ผู้พัฒนาสามารถนำ SPACE ID SDK ในการผสานรวมเข้ากับบริการ name service อื่นๆ ได้ด้วย\n\n## อนาคตหลังจากนี้?\n\nSPACE ID กำลังที่จะเปิดให้บริการลงทะเบียนชื่อโดเมน .bnb ซึ่งจะถือว่าเป็น Top Level Domain (TLD) แรกของทางโปรเจค ซึ่งก็หมายความว่า SPACE ID กำลังจัดเตรียมโครงสร้างพื้นฐานข้อมูลประจำตัวทั้งหมดบน BNB Chain Ecosystem\n\nหลังจากจบช่วงกิจกรรมต่างๆ ชื่อโดเมน .bnb ก็จะเข้าสู่รอบ pre-registration round ดังนั้นต้องแน่ใจว่าตอนนี้คุณได้มี ***.bnb

***“Universal name service network”*** ที่จะทำให้สามาถเชื่อมต่อ ผู้คน, ข้อมูล, สินทรัพย์ และ แอพพลิเคชั่นต่างๆ บนโลก Digital เข้าด้วยกันโดยที่คงไว้ถึงความ Decentralized และเปิดเผยข้อมูล\n\n## ทำไมต้อง universal name service\n\nสาเหตุสำคัญที่ทำให้อินเตอร์เน็ตเป็นที่เฟื่องฟูขึ้นมาก็คือการที่ผู้คนสามารถปฏิสัมพันธ์กันดังนั้นผู้คนเองก็ต้องการที่จะทำให้เรามีตัวตนขึ้นมารวมทั้งยังต้องการให้ตัวตนของเราเป็นที่รู้จัก เช่น มีชื่อของเราปรากฏบนตารางอันดับต่างๆ, บนหน้าต่างแชท, จำนวนเหรียญในกระเป๋า หรือ NFT ที่มี พวกเขาเหล่านั้นต้องการให้ชื่อของตัวเขาเองเป็นที่รู้จักจากผู้คน ไม่ใช่เพียงแค่เลขรหัสกระเป๋า แต่เพื่อให้ทั้งหมดนี้ทำงานได้อย่างมีประสิทธิภาพ เราจำเป็นต้องมีสิ่งที่สามารถยืนยันตัวตนของเราอย่างเป็นสากลที่สามารถใช้งานได้ทุกๆ เชนซึ่งนั่นก็คือ universal identifier นั่นเอง\n\nซึ่งในปัจจุบันนั้นเรามีการยืนยันตัวตนที่ค่อนข้างหลากหลายทั้งชื่อตัวของเราเองหรือตามแต่ละแพลต์ฟอร์มที่เราใช้งานไม่ว่าจะเป็น อีเมล, Twitter handle หรือ address เป็นเชนต่างๆ\n\nการที่มีสิ่งที่สามารถยืนยันตัวตนแบบสกาลนี่เองจะช่วยให้ dApps ต่างๆ สามารถทำงานได้ดีมากขึ้น ซึ่งทำให้ ***SPACE ID (SID)*** จะเป็นมากกว่าแค่ชื่อ แต่จะกลายเป็นตัวตนของเราใน Metaverse ไม่ว่าจะเป็นการ แลกเปลี่ยนคริปโต, ให้ยืมโทเค็น, mint NFTs, ซื้อตั๋วต่างๆ หรือแม้กระทั่งอาจจะซื้อบ้านในอนาคต โดยที่ทั้งหมดใช้เพียงแค่ ID เดียว\n\n## สิ่งท้าทายสำหรับการให้บริการ Domain Service ในปัจจุบัน\n\n* ถูกจำกัดอยู่ในเฉพาะ เชนของตัวเองเพียงเชนเดียว\n* ปัญหา Zero-width issues\n* สิ่งที่เชื่อมต่อ Blockchain ต่างๆ เข้าด้วยกันยังขาดความเป็น decentralization\n* ระบบการลงทะเบียนค่อนข้างซับซ้อน\n* ยังมีการนำชื่อแบรนด์ของ Domain มาผสมกับชื่อผู้ใช้งาน\n* ยังยากที่จะนำไปใช้งานร่วมกับ protocol ต่างๆ\n* จำกัดเฉพาะบริการ Name service เท่านั้น\n\n## แก้ปัญหาต่างๆ ด้วย SPACE ID (SID)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1260/1\\*YV10WJiEotZ1KJvFxqnd4g.png)\n\nSPACE ID เชื่อว่าการระบุตัวตนบน Web3 จะกลายเป็นสิ่งสำคัญในการเชื่อมต่อระหว่างตัวตนของเราในโลกความจริงและโลกดิจิตัล ดังนั้น SPACE ID จึงพยายามที่จะนำปัญหาต่างๆ ที่บรรดาผู้ให้บริการ Name Service ยังพบเจอในปัจจุบัน มาเป็นกุญแจสำคัญในการพัฒนาฟีเจอร์ต่างๆ ของ SID\n\n## Feature 1: Universal Domain\n\n### สร้างแบรนด์ของเราเอง\n\nแน่นอนว่าในอนาคตเรากำลังมุ่งไปสู่การใช้งานบนหลากหลายเชน ซึ่งผู้ใช้งานไม่น้อยเองก็อาจจะประสบปัญหาที่ว่าชื่อที่เราใช้งานบนบล็อคเชนประจำอาจจะถูกแย่งจดทะเบียนไปแล้วในบล็อคเชนอื่นๆ ทำให้เราสูญเสียตัวตนหรือแบรนด์ในชื่อของเราเอง ด้วยการทำงานของ SID ปัญหานี้จะหมดไปเพราะว่าชื่อที่คุณได้จดทะเบียนไว้จะเป็นชื่อที่เฉพาะของคุณในทุกๆ เชน\n\n### รูปแบบชื่อที่เหนือกว่า\n\nชื่อโดเมนในปัจจุบันเช่น .eth หรือ .com ส่วนใหญ่แล้วเป็นเพียงโปรโตคอลที่จบเพียงแค่ให้บริการ name serviceแต่ SID นั้นเป็นมากกว่านั้น เนื่องจากเป็นการให้บริการชื่อหลากหลายเชนได้ ทำให้ โครงสร้างในการทำงานจึงจำเป็นต้องแยกโดเมนระดับบนสุด (Top-Level-Domains) ออกจากชื่อโดเมนของผู้ใช้งาน ด้วยการใช้ ***“:” XX***: สำหรับ Top-Level-Domains และ ***:XX*** สำหรับชื่อผู้ใช้งานปกติ\n\n### ลดความซับซ้อน\n\nสำหรับ SPACE ID ในกรณีที่ผู้ใช้งานได้จดทะเบียนชื่อว่า Allen ดังนั้นในทุกๆ เชนชื่อผู้ใช้งาน :Allen ก็จะถูกใช้งานบนทุกๆ เชนเช่นกัน เช่น **:Allen** บนเชน BNB, :Allen บนเชน Ethereum หรือ :Allen บนเชนCosmos.\n\n### การเชื่อมต่อตัวตน\n\nSPACE ID ยังสามารถทำคุณเชื่อมต่อข้อมูลของคุณจาก Web2 อื่นๆ ได้เช่น Twitter Handle, อีเมล หรือ บัญชี Github ของเรา\n\n## Feature 2: การปรับแต่ง Top-Level-Domains\n\n### ชื่อเฉพาะของคอมมูนิตี้ของคุณ\n\nถึงแม้เราจะมี universal name ของเรา ต่ก็ไม่ได้หมายความว่าเราจะไม่จำเป็นต้องมีข้อมูลตัวตนอื่นๆ ของเราในคอมมูนิตี้ต่างๆ จึงทำให้ Space ID พยายามที่สร้างฟีเจอร์ที่สนับสนุนในการปรับแต่งโดเมนระดับบนสุด (Top-Level-Domains) ได้ในรูปแบบเช่น **“BAYC:”** หรือ **“ETH:”** ซึ่ง TDL นี้ก็จะเทียบเท่ากับ .eth ในปัจจุบัน\n\n### รวมระหว่าง NFT และโดเมนเข้าด้วยกัน:\n\nยกตัวอย่างง่ายๆ สมมุติว่า BAYC ต้องการที่จะแจก airdrop $APE เพิ่มให้กับผู้ถือ NFT ซึ่งสิ่งที่ BAYC ต้องทำก็คือทำการกระจาย $APE ให้กับโดเมนย่อย BAYC:XX ทุกคนเท่านั้น โปรเจคไม่จำเป็นต้องมานั่งค้นหาว่าผู้ถือใช้ชื่อโดเมนจดทะเบียนว่าอะไร ทุกอย่างก็จะถูกส่งให้กับผู้ถือ BAYC:XX\n\n### การรวมกันของ Top-Level-Domains และ เชนต่างๆ\n\nมีประโยชน์มากมายจากการรวม TLDs เข้ากับ การให้บริการบนเชนต่างๆ ยกตัวอย่างเชน หากชื่อที่ถูกจดทะเบียนผ่าน SID ไว้เป็น :Allen ดังนั้นชื่อของ Allen ก็จะสามารถตั้งค่าได้ตามนี้- BAYC:001- ETH:Allen (allen.eth)- BNB:Allen (allen.bnb)- และถ้าหากใน Twitter ชื่อ handle ของเขาใช้ชื่อว่า @Allen เขาก็สามารถ ใช้งานชื่อ Twitter:Allen ได้เช่น\n\n> ***และเมื่อถึงวันที่ทุกสิ่งสามารถนำมารวมกันได้ ผู้ใช้งานก็อาจจะสามารถส่งเหรียญคริปโตต่างๆ ข้ามเชนได้เช่นส่งจาก Solana ไปยัง .bnb domain***\n\n## Feature 3: One Software Development Kit (SDK) for All\n\n### ความรวดเร็วในการใช้งาน\n\nหลังจากที่เปิดให้บริการแล้ว SPACE ID จะไม่ได้ให้บริการฟีเจอร์นี้กับผู้ใช้งานปกติแต่จะเป็นฟีเจอร์สนับสนุนสำหรับบรรดาพาร์ทเนอร์ต่างๆ ซึ่งจะเป็นการช่วยให้สินค้าการให้บริการของ SPACE ID สามารถเข้าถึงผู้ใช้บริการหน้าใหม่ได้ง่ายขึ้นและยังการทำงานของ SPACE ID SDK ยังใช้เวลาสั้นๆ เพียง 30 นาทีเท่านั้น\n\n### การจัดการรวบรวม Name service \n\nการใช้งาน SPACE ID SDK ไม่เพียงแค่ใช้เร็วเร็วง่ายดายใน 30 นาที แต่การที่ SPACE ID ให้บริการในส่วนของ TLD ด้วยนั้นก็จะทำให้ผู้พัฒนาสามารถนำ SPACE ID SDK ในการผสานรวมเข้ากับบริการ name service อื่นๆ ได้ด้วย\n\n## อนาคตหลังจากนี้?\n\n**SPACE ID** กำลังที่จะเปิดให้บริการลงทะเบียนชื่อโดเมน .bnb ซึ่งจะถือว่าเป็น Top Level Domain (TLD) แรกของทางโปรเจค ซึ่งก็หมายความว่า SPACE ID กำลังจัดเตรียมโครงสร้างพื้นฐานข้อมูลประจำตัวทั้งหมดบน BNB Chain Ecosystem\n\nหลังจากจบช่วงกิจกรรมต่างๆ ชื่อโดเมน .bnb ก็จะเข้าสู่รอบ pre-registration round ดังนั้นต้องแน่ใจว่าตอนนี้คุณได้มี ***.bnb Whitelist Badge*** ไว้ในครอบครองแล้ว (***[เช็คที่นี่](https://galaxy.eco/spaceid/campaign/GCbrvUtJj7)***) ถ้าหากยังไม่มีละก็สามารถไปหาซื้อได้ที่ตลาดมือ 2 เช่น กัน และทางโปรเจคจะทำการประกาศวันและเวลา

network states?）\n\n撰文：Vitalik Buterin，以太坊创始人\n\n编译：DOGE\n\n7 月 4 日，Balaji Srinivasan 发布了他的新书第一版，描述了他对「网络国家」的看法：围绕管理社会特定愿景而组织起来的社区，开始时是网上俱乐部，但随着时间的推移最终变得足够强大，以寻求政治自治甚至外交承认。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0714/aecce1c1e5ce4a6d75a61580bda2a024.jpeg)\n\n网络国家可以被看作是对自由主义的意识形态继承的一种尝试。Balaji 反复称赞《主权个人》是重要的读物和灵感，但也在关键方面偏离了它的思想，在他的新作品中集中了社会关系的许多非个人主义和非货币方面，如道德和社区。网络国家也可以被视为一种尝试，为加密空间勾勒出一个更广泛的政治叙事。区块链不是停留在自己的互联网角落，与更广泛的世界脱节，而是可以作为组织人类社会方式的核心。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0714/ade06bb9c4a35f37eae960136c828b49.jpeg)\n\n这些都是很高的承诺，网络国家能够实现这些承诺吗？网络状态是否真的提供了足够的好处，值得我们为之兴奋？无论网络国家的优点是什么，将这个想法与区块链和加密货币联系在一起是否真的有意义？另一方面，这种世界观是否遗漏了什么至关重要的东西？这篇文章代表了我试图理解这些问题的尝试：\n\n**目录**\n\n*   什么是网络状态？\n*   那么，我们可以建立哪些类型的网络国家？\n*   Balaji 对网络国家的政治论证是什么？\n*   你必须喜欢 Balaji 的政治学才能喜欢网络国家吗？\n*   加密货币与网络国家有什么关系？\n*   我喜欢 Balaji 愿景中的哪些方面？\n*   我对 Balaji 的愿景的哪些方面有异议？\n*   非 Balaji 式的网络国家\n*   是否有一条中间道路？\n*   什么是网络状态？\n\n## 什么是网络状态？\n\nBalaji 给出了关于什么是网络状态的多个简短定义。首先，他的定义是一句话：网络国家是一个具有集体行动能力高度一致的网络社区，它在世界各地集资开疆拓土，并最终获得国家的外交承认。这一点到目前为止似乎没有争议。在网上创建一个新的互联网社区，一旦它发展得足够大，会将其实体化，并最终试图通过谈判获得某种地位。几乎任何政治意识形态的人都可以在这个定义下找到他们可以支持的某种形式的网络国家。但现在，我们用一个较长的句子来讨论他的定义：\n\n网络国家是一个具有道德创新、民族意识、公认的创始人、集体行动能力、个人文明程度、综合加密货币、受社会智能合约限制的合意政府、众筹物理领土的群岛、虚拟资本，以及链上人口普查，证明有足够大的人口、收入和房地产足迹，以获得一定程度的外交承认。\n\n在这里，这个概念开始变得有主见：我们不只是在谈论拥有集体机构并最终试图在陆地上实现的在线社区的概念，我们是在谈论一个特定的 Balajian 对网络国家应该是什么样的看法。我们完全有可能支持一般的网络状态，但不同意 Balajian 关于网络状态应该有什么属性的观点。例如，如果你不是一个「加密货币皈依者」，你很难理解为什么 「综合加密货币」是网络状态概念的一个基本组成部分。\n\n最后，Balaji 以更长的形式阐述了这种 Balajian 网络状态的概念。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0714/8f8c21f2fc96bed3d3577da48f85f38d.jpeg)\n\nBalaji 在许多章节强调的一个关键点是任何成功的新社区都需要道德成分。\n\nPaul Johnson 指出，早期美国的宗教殖民地比其营利性殖民地的成功率更高，在创业社会中，你不是要求人们购买产品（这是一个经济的、个人主义的推销），而是加入一个社区（这是一个文化的、集体的推销）。宗教公社的承诺悖论是这里的关键：对其成员要求最多的宗教公社才是最持久的。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0714/c94acc532c0a8ce2c77f35f95382203b.jpeg)\n\n这就是 Balajis 主义与更传统的新自由主义 - 资本主义的理想，即被打败的、非政治的、没有激情的消费主义的明确分歧之处。与草根自由主义者不同，Balajis 不相信一切都可以「仅仅是一种消费品」。相反，他极大地强调了社会规范对凝聚力的重要性，以及对使某一网络状态有别于外部世界的价值观的字面上的宗教依恋。正如 Balaji 在这个播客所说，目前大多数自由主义者对微型国家的尝试就像「没有犹太教的犹太复国主义」，这是他们失败的一个关键原因。\n\n事实上，它是 Antonio Garcia Martinez 对 Balajis 早期的主权 - 个人思想的批评的核心，他赞扬了在迈阿密的古巴流亡者的顽强精神，他们「也许是非理性的，这是我们的新祖国，这是我们最后的立场」。\n\n这个城市，像任何城市一样，有外来的敌人，需要抵御外来的攻击。因此，它需要一个有勇气和公益心的监护人阶层，他们愿意为了公共利益而牺牲自己的物质欲望和愿望。苏格拉底不认为勇气和公心可以从开明的自我利益的计算中产生。相反，它们必须植根于 thymos，植根于守护阶级对自己和自己城市的公正骄傲，以及他们对威胁它人潜在非理性的愤怒。\n\n按照我的解释，Balajis 在《网络国家》中的论点如下：我们不仅需要受经济利益而且受道德力量约束的政治集体，但我们不需要坚持我们今天的具体政治集体，这些政治集体有很大的缺陷，越来越不能代表人们的价值观。相反，我们可以而且应该创造新的、更好的集体。\n\n## 那么，我们可以建立什么样的网络状态？\n\nBalajis 概述了一些关于网络状态的想法，我将把它们浓缩为两个关键方向：生活方式的沉浸和支持技术监管的创新。\n\nBalaji 对生活方式的沉浸的例子是一个围绕健康组织的网络状态。接下来，让我们做一个例子，它需要一个网络群岛（有物理足迹），但不是一个完整的网络国家（有外交承认）。\n\n从美国农业部食品金字塔的历史开始，这个怪胎为全球的企业糖化和肥胖症的流行提供了掩护。. 在网上组织一个社区，为世界各地的财产进行众筹，如公寓楼和健身房，也许最终甚至是小巷和小镇，你可能会采取一种极端的禁糖方法，在边境上禁止加工食品和糖，从而实施一种「Keto Kosher」。\n\n你可以想象这种创业社会的变种，就像「食肉社区」或「Paleo 人」。这些将是在同一广泛领域的竞争性创业社会，是对一个主题的迭代。如果成功的话，这样的社会可能不会止步于糖。它可以为健身和运动设定文化默认值。严格来说，这不需要任何外交上的承认，甚至不需要政治上的自治 -- 从长远来看，这种可以通过谈判为其成员争取更低的健康保险费用和医疗保障税。什么是需要自治的？一个医疗创新的自由区怎么样？\n\n现在让我们来做举一个更复杂的例子，这需要一个完整的网络国家，并得到外交上的承认，这就是医疗主权区，无 FDA 的社会。你以 Henninger 的 FDA 导致的药物滞后的历史和 Tabarrok 的 FDA 对所谓的「非标签」处方的干预的历史开始你的创业社会。你指出有多少人被它的政策所杀害，并向所有新成员明确说明为什么你的医疗主权事业是正义的......\n\n如果是在美国以外的地方，你们的初创公司会在马耳他的食品和药物管理局对新的生物医学制度的支持下开展工作。如果是在美国境内，你需要一个宣布为生物医学提供庇护的州长。也就是说，像一个庇护城市宣布它不会执行联邦移民法一样，一个生物医药的庇护州也不会执行美国食品和药物管理局的法令。\n\n人们可以为这两个类别想出更多的例子，我们可以设立一个可以裸体走动的区域，既保证了你这样做的合法权利，又通过创造一个其他许多人也可以裸体的环境来帮助你感到舒适。或者，你可以设立一个区域，每个人只能穿基本的素色衣服，人们可以为加密货币用户建立一个友好社区，要求每个商店都接受加密货币，并要求有 NFT 才能进入该区。\n\n所有这些例子的共同点是拥有一个物理区域的价值，网络国家的独特规则在这里得到执行。当然，你可以单独坚持只在健康的餐馆吃饭，并在去那里之前仔细研究每家餐馆。但是，有一块独有的土地，你可以保证在这块土地上的任何地方都符合你的标准。当然，你可以游说当地政府收紧健康和安全法规。但是，如果你这样做，你就有可能与那些有着截然不同的偏好的人发生摩擦，而且你有可能把穷人拒之于经济之外，一个网络国家提供了一个温和的方法。\n\n## Balajis 对网络国家的大型政治案例是什么？\n\n读者几乎会立即注意到这本书的一个奇怪的特点是，它有时感觉像是两本书：有时，它是一本关于网络国家概念的书，而有时，它是对 Balajis 政治理论的阐述。Balajis 的政治理论在很多方面都相当出众和有趣。在书的开头，他用一些花边新闻引诱读者。\n\n*   德国赞助了弗拉基米尔 - 列宁，而纽约的银行家们则资助托洛茨基煽动俄国革命，华尔街和约翰 - 里德等美国人的宣传报道都帮助了列宁和托洛茨基的革命。事实上，里德对苏联人非常有用 -- 对革命性质的误导 -- 以至于他被埋在了克里姆林宫的墙里。令人惊讶的是：俄国革命并非完全由俄国人完成。\n*   拥有《纽约时报》公司的奥克斯 - 苏兹伯格家族拥有奴隶，但在 1619 年的报道中没有报道这一事实。\n*   纽约时报》记者沃尔特 - 杜兰蒂因帮助苏联饿死乌克兰而获得普利策奖，而在 90 年前，《纽约时报》决定转而「与乌克兰站在一起」。\n\n你可以在题为「如果新闻是假的，想象一下真实历史」的章节中找到一堆例子，这些例子看起来杂乱无章，事实上，在某种程度上，它们是故意的：目标首先是把读者从他们现有的世界模型中脱离出来，这样他们就可以开始下载 Balajis 自己的思想模型。\n\n但很快，Balaji 的例子确实开始指向一些特殊的主题：对《纽约时报》为例美国左派的深恶痛绝，以及对美国右派对自由的热爱（以比特币极端主义者为例）与对他们对合作和秩序相结合的赞赏。接下来，我们分析 Balaji 对近代历史上的政治调整的概述，最后我们得到了他对当今政治的核心模型。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0714/eac554079d5e11f43b75fa3385164f71.jpeg)\n\n纽约时报团队基本上管理着美国，BTC 团队（指实际的比特币极端主义者和一般的美国右派）有一些积极的价值观，但他们对集体行动和秩序的彻底敌视意味着他们没有能力建设任何东西。CCP 团队可以建设，但他们正在建设一个世界上大部分人都不愿意生活在其中的乌托邦式监控国家。而且这三个团队都太过民族主义了：他们从自己国家的角度看问题，而忽视或剥削其他所有人。即使这些团队在理论上是国际主义的，他们其价值观的具体方式也使他们在世界的一小部分之外不讨人喜欢。\n\n在 Balajis 看来，网络国家是一个「去中心化的中心」，可以创造一个更好的选择。它们结合了 BTC 团队对自由的热爱、团队的道德能量和中心化团队的组织，并为我们提供了三者的最佳利益，避免了最糟糕的部分。这就是简而言之的 Balajis 政治学，它不是试图用一些抽象的理论来证明网络国家的合理性。相反，它是一个将网络国家定位为对世界在当前地点和时间的特定政治形势的回应论点。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0714/a9d37a05b00317c722eb654287ad7307.jpeg)\n\n## 你一定要同意 Balajis 的政治学才能喜欢网络国家吗？\n\nBalajis 政治学的许多方面不会让许多读者信服，如果你认为「象征性」是一个保护弱势群体的重要运动，即它基本上只是职业精英的权力意志的一个面具。如果你担心像乌克兰这样的小国困境，他们受到侵略性邻国的威胁，迫切需要外部支持，那么你不会被 Balajis 的内容所说服。\n\n我确实认为，你可以支持网络国家，同时不同意 Balajis 的一些理由。但首先，我应该解释一下，为什么我认为 Balajis 觉得他对问题的看法和他对解决方案的看法是相通的。长期以来，Balajis 一直对大致相同的问题充满热情；你可以在他 2013 年关于「最终退出」的演讲中看到类似的叙述大纲，即通过技术和退出的方法击败美国的制度硬化，网络国家是他提议的解决方案的最新迭代。\n\n谈论这个问题之所以重要，有几个原因。\n\n为了说明网络国家是保护自由和资本主义的唯一途径，如果美国或「民主自由秩序」很好，那么就不需要替代方案；我们只需加倍努力进行全球协调和法治。但如果美国正处于不可逆转的衰落之中，而它的对手正在上升，那么事情就会变得很不一样。网络国家可以在一个不自由的世界中保持自由的价值观，而霸权主义思维则不能。\n\nBalajis 的许多读者都不在美国，而一个网络国家的世界本来就是全球分布的 -- 这包括许多对美国持怀疑态度的人。Balajis 本人是印度人，并有一个庞大的印度粉丝群。在印度和其他地方，许多人认为美国不是自由主义世界秩序的守护者，Balajis 想说明的是，你不一定要亲美才是自由主义者。\n\n美国左翼媒体的许多部分对加密货币和科技行业都越来越有敌意。Balajis 预计，纽约时报团队的专制左派部分将敌视网络国家，但这并不是看大局的唯一方法。如果你确实相信社会正义价值观、《纽约时报》或美国的重要性作用，怎么办？如果你重视治理创新，但对政治有更温和的看法呢？那么，你可以从两个方面来看待这个问题。\n\n网络国家作为一种协同战略，例如，在美国政治中发生的任何改善平等的事情，只对生活在美国的人口有利。第一修正案并不适用于美国国境之外。许多富裕国家的治理是僵化的，我们需要一些方法来尝试更多的治理创新。网络国家可以填补这一空白。像美国这样的国家可以主办网络国家，吸引来自世界各地的人。成功的网络国家甚至可以作为一个政策模式供各国采用。另外，如果共和党在 2024 年获胜并确保几十年在位，或者美国崩溃了怎么办？你希望有一个替代方案。\n\n退出网络国家，如果每个人在面临国内的问题时，第一直觉是逃亡其他国家，那么将没有人留下来保护和维护国家本身。最终网络国家所依赖的全球基础设施将受到影响。\n\n这两种观点都与 Balajis 的政治学有很多不同意见。因此，为了争论支持或反对 Balajis 的网络国家，我们最终将不得不谈论网络国家。我自己的观点对网络国家是友好的，尽管对网络国家如何运作有很多注意事项和不同想法。\n\n## 加密货币与网络国家有什么关系？\n\n这里有两种对接：一种是精神上的对接，即「比特币成为技术的旗帜」的想法，还有一种是实际对接，即网络国家可以使用区块链和加密代币的具体方式。总的来说，我同意这两个论点 -- 我认为 Balaji 的书可以更明确地阐述它们。\n\n### 精神上的一致\n\n2022 年的加密货币是国际主义自由主义价值观的重要标准制定者，而这种价值观在当今仍然强大的任何其他社会力量中都很难找到。区块链和加密货币本质上是全球性的。大多数以太坊开发者都在美国之外，生活在欧洲 澳大利亚等遥远的地方。NFTs 为非洲和全球南方其他地区的艺术家提供了独特的机会。阿根廷人在 Proof of Humanity、Kleros 和 Nomic Labs 等项目中大显身手。\n\n在许多地缘政治行为者越来越多地只为自己的利益服务的时候，区块链社区继续代表着开放、自由、抗审查和可信的中立性。这进一步增强了它们的国际吸引力：你不必爱美国的霸权主义来爱区块链和它们所代表的价值观。\n\n### 实际的一致性\n\n但是，如果没有区块链的实际使用价值与之相配合，精神上的配合就没有什么意义。Balaji 给出了大量的区块链使用案例。Balaji 最喜欢的一个概念是区块链作为「记录账本」的想法：人们可以在链上对事件进行时间标记，为人类的「微历史」创建一个全球可证明的日志，他继续举了其他例子。\n\n*   像 ZCash、Ironfish 和 Tornado Cash 这样的零知识技术允许在链上证明人们想要公开的东西。\n*   区块链名称系统，如以太坊名称服务（ENS）和 Solana 名称服务（SNS），将身份附加到链上交易。\n*   公司注册系统允许企业抽象在单纯交易层面之上的链上表示，如财务报表，甚至是完全可编程的公司等价物，如 DAO。\n*   加密证书、非同质化代币（NFTs）、非可转让代币（NTFs）和 Soulbounds 允许在链上表示非金融数据，如文凭或背书。\n\n但这一切与网络状态有什么关系？加密城市的具体例子：发行代币，发行 CityDAO 式的公民 NFT，将区块链与零知识密码学结合起来，做安全的隐私保护投票，还有很多。区块链是加密金融和加密治理的乐高积木：它们是实施透明的协议内规则以治理公共资源、资产和激励措施的一个非常有效的工具。\n\n但我们还需要更深入一层。区块链和网络状态有一个共同的属性，即它们都在试图「创造一个新的根」。公司不是一个根：如果公司内部有纠纷，最终会由国家法院系统解决。而区块链和网络国家，则试图成为新的根。这并不意味着需要一些绝对的「呐喊，没有人能抓住我」的主权理想，也许只有那些拥有高度自给自足的国民经济和 / 或核武器的～5 个国家才能真正实现。个人区块链参与者当然容易受到国家监管，而网络国家更是如此。但区块链是唯一的基础设施系统，它试图在非国家层面做最终的争端解决（通过链上智能合约逻辑或通过自由分叉），这使得它们成为网络国家的理想基础架构。\n\n## 我喜欢 Balaji 愿景的哪些方面？\n\n鉴于纯粹的「只有私有产权」的自由主义不可避免地会遇到一些问题，比如它无法为公共产品提供资金，因此 21 世纪任何成功的支持自由的方案都必须是一个混合体，这里包含一个妥协理念，至少能解决 80% 的问题，这样独立的个人倡议就能解决其余问题。这可以是一些针对经济权力和财富集中的严格措施（也许每年对所有东西征收 Harberger 税），可以是 85% 的乔治主义土地税，可以是 UBI，可以是强制要求足够大的公司在内部实现民主，或者其他任何建议。并非所有这些都有效，但你需要一些激烈的东西才能有任何机会。\n\n一般来说，我习惯于妥协的想法是一个左派的想法：某种形式的平等和民主。另一方面，Balaji 的「大妥协」理念更像是右派的：具有共同价值观、忠诚度、宗教、物质环境结构以鼓励个人纪律（「Keto kosher」）和努力工作的地方社区。这些价值观是以一种非常自由主义和技术领先的方式实施的，不是围绕土地、历史、民族和国家，而是围绕云和个人选择，但它们仍然是右派价值观。这种思维方式对我来说是陌生的，但我发现它很吸引人，也很重要。刻板印象中的「富有的白人自由主义者」如果忽视了这一点，他们将面临危险：这些更传统的价值观甚至在美国的一些少数民族中也相当受欢迎，在非洲和印度等地更是如此，而这正是 Balaji 试图建立其基础的地方。\n\n## 但是网络状态是否真的让我感兴趣？\n\n「Keto Kosher」以健康为重点的生活方式的沉浸式网络状态当然是我想居住的一个状态。我可以只花时间在有很多健康东西的城市，即使是与其他有类似目标的人在一起的激励方面，听起来也非常吸引人。但真正有趣的东西是治理创新：利用网络状态，以现有法规下实际上不可能的方式组织起来，有三种方式可以解释这里的基本目标：\n\n*   创造新的监管环境，让他们的居民有不同于主流偏好的优先事项：例如，「任何人都可以裸体走动」的区域，或在安全和便利之间实施不同权衡的区域，或让更多精神活性物质合法化的区域。\n*   创建新的监管机构，在服务于与现状相同的优先事项方面可能更有效率。例如，与其通过监管特定行为来改善环境友好度，不如直接征收 Pigovian 税。你可以要求强制性的责任保险，而不是要求许多行为的许可证和监管部门的预先批准。你可以用二次元投票来治理，用二次元资金来资助地方公共产品。\n*   通过增加某些司法机构允许你做任何特定事情的机会来反对一般的监管保守主义。例如，制度化的生物伦理学是一个保守事业，20 人死于医学实验的错误是一个悲剧，但 200000 人死于疫情在某些人看来是一个统计数字。允许人们选择接受更高风险水平的网络状态可能是反对这种情况的成功策略。\n\n总的来说，我认为这三者都有价值。\n\n1.  大规模的制度化可以使这个词同时更加自由，同时使人们对某些事情的更高水平的限制感到舒服，因为他们知道如果他们想做不允许的事情，他们可以去其他区域做。更广泛地说，我认为 \\[1] 中隐藏着一个重要的想法：虽然「社会技术」社区围绕更好的治理提出了许多好的想法，但缺少对更好的社会技术进行分类的强调。我们不只是想把现有的社会关系图当作固有，并在其中找到更好的方法来达成共识。我们还想改革社会关系网本身，让人们更接近与他们更兼容的其他人，以更好地让不同的生活方式保持自己的独特性。\n2.  令人振奋，因为它解决了政治中的一个主要问题：与创业公司不同，创业公司的早期阶段看起来有点像后期阶段的迷你版，而在政治中，早期阶段是一个公共话语游戏，选择的东西往往与实际工作中的东西非常不同。如果治理理念经常在网络状态下实施，那么我们就会从外向型的「说话的自由主义」转向更平衡的「做事的自由主义」，在这种情况下，理念的兴衰取决于它们在小范围内的实际效果。我们甚至可以把 \\[1] 和 \\[2] 结合起来：为那些想每年自动参与新的治理实验作为一种生活方式的人设立一个区域。\n3.  当然是一个更复杂的道德问题：您是否将瘫痪和逐渐走向威权全球政府视为一个问题，或者将某人发明了一种毁灭我们所有人的邪恶技术视为一个更大的问题。我一般在第一阵营；我担心西方陷入一种低增长的保守主义，我喜欢民族国家之间不完美的协调如何限制全球版权法等事物的可执行性，这样的可能性借助未来的监控技术，整个世界将进入一个高度自我执行但又无法摆脱的可怕政治平衡。\n\n## 我对 Balaji 愿景的哪些方面有异议？\n\n有四个方面是我最担心的。\n\n*   为什么网络国家需要一个公认的创始人来做核心？\n*   如果网络国家最终只为富人服务怎么办？\n*   仅仅是「退出」并不足以稳定全球政治。那么，如果退出是每个人的第一选择，会发生什么？\n*   更普遍的全球负外部性怎么办？\n\n### 创始人\n\n在整本书中，Balaji 坚持认为创始人在一个网络国家（或者说，一个初创社会：你创立了一个初创社会，如果你足够成功，得到外交上的认可，就会成为一个网络国家）中的重要性，Balaji 明确地将初创社会的创始人描述为「道德企业家」。但作为创业公司的创始人，你并不是一个技术企业家，告诉投资者为什么这个新的创新更好、更快、更便宜。你是一个道德企业家，告诉潜在的未来公民一种更好的生活方式，告诉他们现有世界中的错误事情，而你的社区正在将其纠正。\n\n创始人将道德直觉和从历史中学到的东西具体化为一种哲学，而那些道德直觉与这种哲学相吻合的人就会凝聚在这个项目上。这在早期阶段是非常合理的 -- 尽管这绝对不是创业社会如何出现的唯一方法。但在后期阶段会发生什么呢？马克 - 扎克伯格作为 facebook 这个创业公司的核心创始人，也许是必要的。但马克 - 扎克伯格负责一个价值数十亿美元（事实上是数十亿用户）的公司是完全不同的事情。\n\n小东西被集中起来很好，极其大的事业被集中起来就很可怕了。而鉴于网络效应的现实，只有退出的选择是不够的。在我看来，如何沉淀到创始人控制之外的问题很重要，而 Balaji 在这方面花的精力太少。公认的创始人被纳入了 Balaji 网络国家的定义中，但走向更广泛参与治理的路线图却没有。\n\n### 每个不富裕的人怎么办？\n\n在过去的几年里，我们看到世界各地的政府有许多例子明确地对科技人才更加开放。有 42 个国家提供数字游民签证，有法国的科技签证，新加坡加密友好政策以及许多其他国家。这对技术专家和富人来说都是好事，被封锁的富豪往往可以通过花几十万美元购买另一本护照来逃避世界对低收入国家公民的系统性歧视。但普通人呢？在缅甸面临极端条件的少数民族罗兴亚人怎么办，他们中的大多数人没有办法进入美国或欧洲，更不用说再买一本护照了。\n\n在这里，我们看到了网络国家概念的一个潜在悲剧。一方面，我看到出境可以成为二十一世纪全球人权保护的最可行战略。如果另一个国家正在压迫一个少数民族，你会怎么做？你可以什么都不做。你可以制裁他们，你可以尝试入侵。退出是一个更人道的选择。遭受人权暴行的人可以直接离开，去更友好的国家，而协调成群结队地离开意味着他们可以在不牺牲他们所依赖的友谊和经济生计的社区的情况下离开。而如果你错了，你所批评的政府实际上没有那么恶劣，那么人们就不会离开，一切都很好，不需要饥饿或炸弹，这一切都很美好。\n\n答案是什么呢？说实话，我没有看到。赞成网络国家的一个观点是，它们可以设在穷国，并吸引国外的富人，然后帮助当地经济。但这对穷国中想要脱身的人来说毫无帮助，在现有国家内采取老式的政治行动，放宽移民法似乎是唯一的选择。\n\n### 无处可逃\n\n在俄罗斯 2 月 24 日入侵乌克兰之后，Noah Smith 写了一篇重要的文章，论述了这次入侵应该给我们的思想带来的道德清晰性。其中一个特别引人注目的标题为「无处可逃」，引述如下：\n\n虽然「退出」在地方层面上可行 -- 如果旧金山的功能太差，你可能可以搬到奥斯汀或其他科技城，但在国家层面上根本行不通。事实上，那些搬到新加坡等国家或波多黎各等领土的加密富豪，仍然在很大程度上依赖于发达国家的基础设施和机构。俄罗斯正在使人们更加清楚地看到，这种战略是注定要失败的，因为最终无处可逃。与以前的时代不同，大国的手臂足够长，可以到达世界的任何地方。\n\n### 那么，那些负面的外部因素呢？\n\n如果我们在世界各地有一百个监管不力的创新实验室，这可能会导致一个更难预防的世界。这就提出了一个问题：相信 Balaji 主义是否需要相信一个负外部性并不是太大问题的世界？这样的观点将与「脆弱世界假说」（VWH）相反，后者认为随着技术的进步，一个或几个疯狂的人越来越容易杀死数百万人，可能需要全球专制监控来防止极端痛苦甚至人类灭绝。\n\n一个出路可能是专注于自卫技术。在一个网络国家的世界里，我们不可能禁止功能增益的研究，但我们可以利用网络国家来帮助世界沿着一条道路，采用真正好的 HEPA 空气过滤、远紫外线光、早期检测基础设施和一个非常快速的疫苗开发和部署管道，不仅可以击败病毒，而且还可以击败更糟糕的生物武器。自卫技术可能是一个被低估的资金重点领域。但仅仅依靠这一点是不现实的。需要进行跨国合作，因此，我们确实希望有这样一个世界，即使网络国家比今天的意向社区拥有更多的主权，它们的主权也不是绝对的。\n\n## 非 Balaji 式的网络国家\n\n读《网络国家》让我想起十年前读过的一本不同的书。David de Ugarte 的《Phyles 二十一世纪的经济民主》（Economic Democracy in the Twenty First Century）。Phyles 谈到了类似的围绕价值观组织的跨国社区的想法，但它有一个更左倾的重点：它假设这些社区将是民主的，受到 2000 年时代的网络社区和 19 世纪和 20 世纪的合作社和工作场所民主思想的启发。通过观察 de Ugarte 的形成理论，我们可以最清楚地看到这些差异。由于我已经花了很多时间引用 Balaji 的话，我将阐述下 David de Ugarte 一个公平的说法。\n\n博客圈是一个身份和对话的海洋，在不断的交叉繁殖和变化中，伟大的社会消化周期性地从其中提炼出具有自身背景和特定知识的稳定群体。这些在发展到一定程度后形成的对话社区，在我们所说的数字犹太复国主义中发挥着主要作用：它们开始沉淀为现实，在其成员中产生相互的知识，这使得它们对他们来说比传统的想象中的社区（国家、阶级、聚会等）更具有身份上的重要性，就好像它是一个真正的社区（朋友的团体、家庭、公会等）。\n\n对话网络中的一些身份认同的和密集的群体开始产生自己的经济代谢，并随之产生一个独特的 Demos 把培育社区本身的自主性作为自己的目标。这些就是我们所说的新威尼斯人网络。它们诞生于博客圈，是黑客工作伦理的继承者，并在概念世界中活动，这倾向于我们在本书第一部分谈到的经济民主。与传统的合作主义不同的是，由于他们不是来自于真正的基于近距离的社区，他们的地方纽带并不产生认同。\n\n我们看到了一些 Balaji 的想法：共同的集体身份，但围绕着价值观而不是地理形成的，一开始是云端的讨论社区，但后来具体化为接管了经济生活的大部分内容。De Ugarte 使用了与 Balaji 完全相同的比喻（「数字犹太复国主义」）但我们也看到了关键的不同：Balaji 的观点是：「数字犹太复国主义」是一种以人为本的理念。\n\n但我们也看到一个关键的区别：没有单一的创始人。与其说一个创业社会是由一个人的行为形成的，将直觉和思想股结合成一个连贯的正式记录的哲学，不如说一个 phyle 开始时是博客圈的一个对话网络，然后直接变成一个团体，随着时间的推移做得越来越多 -- 同时保持其民主和横向性质。整个过程更加有机，完全不是由一个人的意图所引导。当然，我所看到的直接挑战是这种结构所固有的激励问题。对 Phyles 和 The Network State 的一种总结也许是不公平的，The Network State 试图用 2010 年代的区块链作为如何重组人类社会的模型，而 Phyles 试图用 2000 年代的开源软件社区和博客作为如何重组人类社会的模型。开源有激励不足的失败模式，加密货币有激励过度和过度集中的失败模式。但这确实表明，某种中间方式应该是可能实现的。\n\n## 是否有一个中间道路？\n\n到目前为止，我的判断是，网络国家是伟大的，但它们远不是一个可行的妥协思想，可以真正堵塞所有的漏洞，建立我和我的大多数读者希望在 21 世纪看到的那种世界。归根结底，我确实认为，我们需要引入更多的民主和面向大规模协调的某种妥协理念，以使网络国家真正取得成功。\n\n以下是我对 Balajism 的一些重大调整：\n\n创始人启动是可以的（虽然不是唯一的方式），但我们真的需要一个路线图，把权力下放到社区，许多创始人最终想退休或开始新的事情，我们需要防止网络状态崩溃或在发生这种情况时而导致权力下放失败。这个过程的一部分是某种宪法规定的退出社区的保证：当网络状态进入更高的成熟度和规模层级时，来自社区成员的更多权力会被自动考虑。\n\nProspera 尝试了类似的东西。正如 Scott Alexander 总结的那样：\n\n一旦 Próspera 拥有 10 万居民（如果实验非常成功），他们可以举行公投，51% 的多数人可以改变宪章的任何内容，包括将 HPI 完全踢出，成为一个直接的民主国家，或者重新加入洪都拉斯的其他国家。\n\n这个过程的另一部分，也是我在以太坊成长过程中认识到的，就是明确鼓励更广泛地参与社区的道德和哲学发展。以太坊有它的 Vitalik，但它也有它的 Polynya，你的创业社会将如何招募它的前十个 Polynyas？\n\n### 网络国家应该由一些非代币驱动的治理方式来管理\n\n代币驱动的治理是财阀式的，容易受到攻击；我已经写过很多次了，但值得重复一下。像 Optimism 的 soulbound 和每人的公民 NFT 的想法是这里的关键。Balaji 已经承认了对非 fungibility 的需求（他支持代币锁定），但我们应该更进一步，更明确地支持不只是股东驱动的治理。这也将产生有益的副作用，即更民主的治理更有可能与外部世界保持一致。\n\n### 网络国家承诺通过治理中的外部代表使自己变得友好\n\n理性主义和友好型人工智能社区的一个未被充分讨论的想法是功能决策理论。这是一个复杂的概念，但强大的核心思想是，人工智能可以比人类更好地协调，解决人类经常失败的囚徒困境，通过对其源代码做出可验证的公开承诺。一个人工智能可以重写自己，使其拥有一个模块，防止它欺骗拥有类似模块的其他人工智能。这样的人工智能会在囚徒困境中相互合作。\n\n正如我多年前指出的，DAO 有可能做同样的事情。它们可以有明确的治理机制，对拥有类似机制的其他 DAO 更加友好，网络国家将由 DAO 管理，这也将适用于网络国家。他们甚至可以致力于治理机制，承诺将更广泛的公众利益考虑在内（例如，20% 的选票可以给随机选择的主办城市或国家的居民），而不必遵循具体的复杂规定，他们应该如何考虑这些利益如何分配。这样做的网络国家明确更友好的政策，可能是一个更好的世界。\n\n## 结论\n\n我希望看到沿着这类愿景的创业社会存在，我希望看到围绕健康生活的沉浸式生活方式实验，我希望看到疯狂的治理实验，其中公共产品由二次方资金资助，我希望看到更多的技术实验，接受更高的风险水平，而且我认为基于区块链的代币、身份和信誉系统以及 DAO 可能是一个很好的选择。\n\n同时，我担心目前形式的网络国家愿景有可能只满足那些富豪的需求，而许多经济并不宽裕的人将被抛在尘埃中。可以说对网络国家有利的是它们的国际主义：国家之间的不平等占全球不平等的三分之二，国家内部的不平等只占三分之一。但是，这仍然留下了所有国家中的许多人，而这一愿景并没有起到什么作用。因此，我们也需要一些其他的东西 -- 为全球的穷人，为那些希望保留自己国家被入侵的乌克兰人，以及其他所有不能立即进入网络国家的群体考虑。\n\n网络国家，通过一些修改推动更民主的治理和与周围社区的积极关系，这是一个我可以支持的愿景。\n", "timestamp": 1658207732, "digest": "QNqu-dL2orTA7RVSPSASccCO96oEPP2BNDf7sbO9mVM", "contributor":

{"id": "kwxKsIp1T-Ad1guXK6JNj0MfBBbh_f2tuH76j3ADF1k", "title": "Crypto x Regenerative Design", "body": "Talk about regenerative cryptoeconomics is all the rage lately. Spend of few minutes scrolling through crypto Twitter and you will likely come across hashtags for #regen, #solarpunk, and a host of beautifully designed futuristic cityscapes. \n\nWhile the promise of a better, more sustainable future with happy humans and a healthy environment is a great motivator, if we want to create this future we need to start thinking about and designing systems that will enable this future. \n\nThis starts with understanding what [regenerative design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_design) is, what are some key principles we can apply when designing new systems, and how crypto values and incentives fit into this picture of creating a better world. \n\n### What is Regenerative Design?\n\nThe concept of regenerative design grew out of [permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture) and the goal of developing regenerative agricultural systems. \n\nRegenerative design is a systems approach to design that is intended to revitalize or restore communities, human, and natural resources. \n\nThe goal of regenerative design is to develop systems and networks (communities) that are restorative and emergent, benefitting both humans and the broader ecosystem. It does this by focusing on creating [circular economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy) for sustainable consumption and to improve resource efficiency in the system. \n\nFrom its initial conception of creating regenerative agriculture systems, regenerative design has expanded to include [regenerative architecture](https://hmcarchitects.com/news/regenerative-architecture-principles-a-departure-from-modern-sustainable-design-2019-04-12/), [regenerative economics](https://capitalinstitute.org/8-principles-regenerative-economy/), and even [regenerative communities](https://www.regencommunities.net/). \n\n### How is this different from Green or sustainable design?\n\nWhen I first came across discussion about regenerative design, I was curious if this was the same or different from principles like green design or sustainability. There are a couple of important distinctions worth noticing. \n\nGreen design focuses on reduction. The main goal of green design is to reduce energy consumption, eliminate waste, minimize environmental impact, or reduce environmental exposure to harmful materials.\n\nSustainable design focuses on net-zero or net-positive systems. The goal of sustainable design is to balance economic, environmental, and social responsibilities. It is possible to design systems that meet the goals of the current population without depleting resources needed for future generations. Sustainable design often operates are concepts like net-zero or net-positive systems. Net-zero systems are where the total amount of energy is equal to the amount of renewable energy generated. Net-positive systems not only reduce the negative impacts, but have a positive impact or positive externality on the ecosystem. \n\nRegenerative design focuses on relationships that create flourishing ecosystems.  Regenerative design creates feedback loops that allow for adaptability and emergence within the system, leading to ecosystems that are more resilient and have the potential to thrive and flourish. While sustainable design focuses on the *balance* of the economic, environmental, and social responsibilities of the system, regenerative design focuses on *mapping the relationships* of the system and places more importance on [conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation) and diversity within the system. Critical to this design approach is the co-evolutionary relationship between humans and the system. \n\n### Key Principles\n\nNow that we have a better understanding of regenerative design, it is helpful to have some key principles to keep in mind when thinking about how we can improve systems.\n\n1. Understand the system and its unique relationships. This includes things like the local culture, environment (physical or digital), and the interactions that play out in the system.\n2. Design for wholeness within the system.\n3. Enhance co-evolutionary relationships within the system that extend to the broader world over time.\n\n### Real World Examples\n\n**Agriculture**\n\nSince regenerative design started with agriculture there are many examples of successful projects. Most everyone has heard about how the [reintroduction of wolves](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/25/yellowstone-wolf-project-25th-anniversary) into Yellowstone National Park restored the ecosystem and promoted many other plants and animals thriving. \n\n[Regeneration International](https://regenerationinternational.org/why-regenerative-agriculture/) has a list of farms that are currently implementing these principles, and the [Billion Agave Project](https://regenerationinternational.org/billion-agave-project) being one example of how a systems approach can produce flourishing ecosystems even in desert climates. \n\n**Architecture**\n\nRegenerative design is a much more recent trend in architecture, which has implemented green design and sustainable principles for the past couple decades. There are not a lot of examples of regenerative architecture projects, but the most famous might be the [Bosco Verticale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosco_Verticale) residential towers in Milan, Italy. \n\n![Credit: https://www.stefanoboeriarchitetti.net/en/project/vertical-forest/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PalubV0_XbXQaXVHO4yoP.png?height=1366&width=2048)\n\nOver the next decade we will see more of these [design principles applied to the built environment](https://www.ribaj.com/intelligence/climate-change-emergency-regenerative-design-michael-pawlyn) and the communities in which we live and work. \n\n**Networks (Communities)**\n\nWe are also starting to see regenerative design in the restoration and renewal of communities. [Self-organizing collectives](https://capitalinstitute.org/regenerative-communities/) are forming and working towards a shared purpose. These communities rely on coordination and collaboration in order to build a movement that can create the tools and infrastructure needed. These types of communities promote leadership and transform not only the people, but also the way they organize, share resources, and use capital assets. \n\n**Economics**\n\nThe last area we are seeing implementation of [regenerative design is in economic systems](https://capitalinstitute.org/8-principles-regenerative-economy/) that regenerate capital assets that contribute to the well-being of society. \n\n![Credit: Capital Institute](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eq0WJYS6UBWcJH71ImBTh.png?height=550&width=550)\n\n### How Crypto Can Usher in a Regenerative Future\n\n[Regenerative cryptoeconomics](https://banklessdao.substack.com/p/daos-as-playgrounds-for-growth-and) is the use of crypto values and incentives to design new kinds of regenerative systems, applications, and networks. We can already see that regenerative networks share many of the qualities and characteristics that we find in DAOs. The advantage of DAOs is they can use crypto to incentivize certain behaviors and actions in ways that non-crypto communities can’t take advantage of. \n\nIn my next article I will be exploring how crypto values and incentives can facilitate the creation of regenerative communities, applications, and protocols. By starting small, Web3 can start to create systems that are more likely to be resilient and regenerative. As more and more micro-systems can be built, we can create a network of smaller systems that have the potential to create a larger regenerative ecosystem. \n\nBy having a better understanding of regenerative design and some of the key principles, we can start to envision building small regenerative networks that have the potential to restore society as a whole. \n\n \n \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1658207674, "digest": "aVpuzLJTq3qTLM8b71EH_S9QNhkjY6Mk0Yv5zGRpko4", "contributor": "0x1CC214f8E3a9977c0019BaB3EF8103Db50C0CCf9"}

"本文将信任构建作为档案界与区块链的共同愿景，在界定“可信数字档案”的基础上，重点探讨区块链应用于档案可信性保障的关键问题与发展策略。\n\n作者：何思源\n\n**摘要：**数字时代和网络空间，现有的档案信任体系受到了前所未有的冲击与挑战，区块链的出现为构建更为坚实的基于数字技术的信任机制提供了契机。本文将信任构建作为档案界与区块链的共同愿景，将可信数字档案的基本属性归纳为真实性、可靠性、完整性、齐全性和可用性，分别阐述区块链和档案学方法的信任构建逻辑及其互补性，参照5W1H的基本框架，从上链范围、应用场景、上链时机、参与节点、技术选型等维度重点探讨区块链应用于档案可信性保障的关键问题，并提出未来的发展策略。\n\n信任是人类社会的基本议题。档案作为人类社会活动的原始记录，既是业务凭证，也是法律证据。档案工作正是通过捍卫档案的真实、建立对档案的信任，才能发挥其在业务查考、决策支持、研究教育等领域的作用，进而维持组织机构乃至人类社会的良性运转。但在数字时代和网络空间，现有的档案信任体系受到了前所未有的冲击与挑战，区块链的出现为构建更为坚实的基于数字技术的信任机制提供了契机。本文将信任构建作为档案界与区块链的共同愿景，在界定“可信数字档案”的基础上，阐述二者的信任构建逻辑及其互补性，重点探讨区块链应用于档案可信性保障的关键问题与发展策略。\n\n**可信数字档案**\n\n在国际档案界，建立对数字档案的信任主要有两种理论逻辑，一种是保障数字档案本身的可信性，一种是通过维护信息系统的安全可靠建立对数字档案的信任\\[1]。对主要采用第一种思路的中国而言，如何理解和诠释可信性成为关键。纵观国内外理论与实践成果，有两个最具影响力的流派，一是国际标准《信息与文献—文件管理 第一部分：概念与原则》（ISO 15489-1: 2016）提出的“四性说”，即可信数字档案需要满足真实性（Authenticity）、可靠性（Reliability）、完整性（Integrity）、可用性（Useability）\\[2]；二是InterPARES项目提出的“三性说”，即可信性包括可靠性（Reliability）、真实性（Authenticity）、准确性（Accuracy）\\[3]。虽然二者使用的部分术语相同，但含义存在差异。中共中央办公厅和国务院办公厅联合印发的《电子文件管理暂行办法》主要借鉴ISO 15489的观点，并将其修改为真实性（Authenticity）、完整性（Integrity）、可用性（Useability）和安全性（Security）。由于《电子文件管理暂行办法》中的安全性与完整性存在概念交叉且安全性本身的边界模糊、不易界定，本文基本采纳ISO 15489的原始表述，但由于其完整性具有双重含义，为便于表达、避免歧义，将其拆为完整性（Integrity）和齐全性（Completeness），如表1所示。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0718/10fba3cfde0d4fbb00b15de13b303767.png)\n\n**区块链与档案界的信任构建逻辑**\n\n**（一）区块链的信任构建逻辑**\n\n区块链（Blockchain）是一种由多方共同维护，使用密码学保证传输和访问安全，能够实现数据一致存储、难以篡改、防止抵赖的分布式账本技术\\[4]。它不是一种独立的信息技术，而是数字摘要、数字签名、可信时间戳、非对称加密、分布式数据库等技术的组合应用，主要通过建立在密码学基础上的技术逻辑实现信任构建，尤为适用于弱信任环境下的多主体协作。其不可篡改性、可追溯性、抗抵赖性与档案可信性之间存在天然联系，主要涉及四个方面：\n\n其一，区块链的数据存储结构是按时间顺序排列的块链式数据结构，区块间通过哈希指针形成“环环相扣”“层层嵌套”的链式结构。\n\n其二，区块链与传统数据库的增删改查等常规操作不同，只有新增和查询操作，没有删除和修改操作（删改均需通过新增实现），所有操作都以日志形式完整记录。\n\n其三，区块链的本质是分布式数据库，依赖P2P网络，多节点通过共识机制共同维护、验证数据。\n\n其四，数字签名能为主体身份认证提供证据。其中，去中心化、块链式结构和数据操作限制使其具有不可篡改性；时序排列使其具有可追溯性；数字签名使其具有抗抵赖性。\n\n**（二）档案界的信任构建逻辑**\n\n在传统环境中，对档案的信任依赖于对档案机构及档案工作者职业道德的信任。在人类社会发展的早期阶段，存贮档案的场所通常具有神圣性，例如西方的神庙和中国西周时期的天府。在此阶段，人们借助机构的神圣性实现对档案的信任。但在数字时代，档案机构面临着严重的信任危机。一方面，数字档案具有载体和信息可分离性、易变性等特点；另一方面，随着后现代的兴起，档案概念呈现出“泛化”趋势，越来越多的非传统、非官方的档案资源进入公众视野，例如社交媒体档案、网页档案、私人档案、社群档案等，权威性不再是档案资源的固有属性。此外，随着后真相时代的到来，官方机构的公信力受到质疑，加之网络上关于档案篡改的新闻层出不穷，尤其是审计、纪检监察、司法诉讼、税务稽查等特定场景下，传统的档案信任机制无法有效运转。\n\n为构建适应数字环境的档案信任机制，档案界展开了三十余年的探索与实践。在真实性、可靠性和完整性保障方面，已经形成基于管理与技术双重逻辑的信任体系。其中，管理维度涉及制度规范和业务操作两个层面，在制度规范层，需要建立规范的流程和要求，包括前端控制和全程管理；在业务操作层，需要对档案形成至销毁或永久保存的全生命周期管理进行元数据著录，定期对数字档案进行检测。技术维度主要有用户身份识别、权限控制、数字摘要、数字签名、可信时间戳等。其中，最具档案特色的是全程元数据著录，即基于背景关系的信任构建逻辑，尤以国际标准《信息和文献.记录管理过程.记录用元数据.第1部分：原则》（ISO 23081-1-2017）提出的文件管理元数据模型最为典型。该模型包括文件、业务、责任者、法规标准和关系五类实体\\[5]，我国也据此制定了面向文书、照片、声像等不同门类档案的元数据方案，旨在通过呈现档案与其业务背景间的关系构建档案信任体系。在齐全性保障层面，系统研究了数字档案的构成要素，形成了三要素、四要素、五要素等不同理论流派，目前得到广泛认可的是由内容、结构、背景构成的三要素。在可用性保障层面，形成了以OAIS参考模型为框架，以保存规划与管理方案为支撑，以格式管理、更新、复制、仿真、迁移、封装等策略为核心的保障体系。\n\n**（三）区块链与档案学方法的相辅相成**\n\n如果将区块链的可信性维护能力映射到前文提出的可信数字档案基本属性中，可发现区块链虽然能解决真实性和完整性问题，但却无法解决所有的信任问题。例如，区块链无法确保档案的内容与客观事实相符，即无法解决数据上链前的内容真实问题（即可靠性问题）。而现有的档案学方法虽然较为全面、系统地解决了可信性问题，但在实际操作过程中，数字签名等技术通常依赖于特定的认证机构（如CA机构）。我国有40多家不同的CA，第一，不一定所有的单位都使用CA；第二，不同单位可能使用不同的CA；第三，同一单位内部也可能使用不同的CA；第四，不同CA间无法实现互信互认，从而影响真实性保障效果。而区块链恰好可以弥补依赖特定认证机构的电子签名等方案的不足，因此，可将区块链作为档案可信性保障的一种技术手段。\n\n综上，在区块链应用场景中，档案学方法（尤其是背景关系维护）能帮助其更好地实现数据可信的目标，为其提供更完整的信任构建思路；与此同时，区块链也可以作为一种技术要素嵌入档案信任机制，与现有的管理策略和技术方法融合，实现优势互补，构建更完善的档案信任基础设施。本文接下来将以后者为重点，对基于区块链的档案可信性保障展开探讨。\n\n**区块链应用于档案可信性保障的关键问题**\n\n区块链与档案界在信任构建方面具有天然的契合性，档案界早在2015年就开始探索区块链在档案管理领域的应用。美国、英国、加拿大、中国、韩国、印度、鞑靼斯坦共和国、伊朗、吉尔吉斯斯坦、博茨瓦纳、津巴布韦等国高度重视区块链在本国档案领域的应用。在新技术持续迭代的时代，区块链应用的首要原则是坚持业务导向，以需求引导应用，有针对性地解决业务实践中的痛点与难点问题，避免出现盲目追逐技术热点、“为用链而用链”的现象。本文将参照5W1H框架提出应用过程中需解决的关键问题，由于Why的问题前面已有所涉及，在此不再赘述。\n\n**（一）上链范围（What）**\n\n档案工作者首先需要思考哪些类型的档案需要上链、哪些类型的档案不能上链。就前者而言，需要考虑区块链的适用性问题，尤其是“多主体”和“弱信任”两个因素。中国人民大学信息资源管理学院刘越男教授认为，有三类档案尤为适合应用区块链，一是需要跨机构形成或处理的文件，例如合同、招投标文件、工程建设项目档案、供应链档案等；二是需要外部调用的文件，例如会计档案等财务类档案；三是需要跨机构共享利用的凭证文件，例如电子证照、电子学籍等业务凭证及婚姻档案等民生档案\\[6]。就后者而言，需系统考虑区块链不可删改、去中心化等特点带来的风险。目前来看，出于安全考虑，涉密档案不适合上链；含有大量个人敏感信息的档案、到期需要处置的档案是否可以上链还有待考量。尤其是需要到期处置的档案，区块链通过销毁私钥的方式实现数据销毁是否能为档案界接受仍需探讨。\n\n**（二）应用场景（Where）**\n\n区块链在档案可信性保障中的核心应用场景是加强数字档案凭证能力和支持数字档案共享利用。第一种场景可从两个角度进行细分：一是从生命周期角度来看，在形成机构阶段，可维护数字档案在组织机构内部从形成到销毁或移交的真实性和完整性，为我国大力推进的电子文件单套制归档和单轨制管理提供了技术保障。企业档案馆（室）展开的实践探索多为此类，例如，中国石油化工集团有限公司（简称“中石化”）、中国电力建设集团有限公司（简称“中国电建”）、上海证券交易所等单位的档案区块链项目。在档案馆阶段，可维护数字档案在长期保存过程中的真实性和完整性，夯实数字档案馆的信任基础，例如，英国国家档案馆的ARCHANGEL项目、InterPARES项目欧洲团队提出的TrustChain模型/项目。二是从应用深度来看，既可以将区块链视作辅助性的可信性保障手段，将其作为叠加在现有档案管理系统上的一种技术，旨在实现真实性和完整性验证、全流程追溯，我国的项目及英国国家档案馆、InterPARES项目的案例均属此类；也可以将其作为档案管理系统的底层基础设施，以期在可信性保障的基础上发挥区块链的更多价值（如智能合约驱动的业务流程自动化），例如美国特拉华州公共档案馆的Smart Records（智能文件）项目。第二种场景既包括档案机构内部的共享、档案部门间的共享，也包括档案部门与其他部门间的共享，沈阳市档案馆、中国科学院合肥物质科学研究所开展的区块链项目均属此类。典型场景之一就是民生档案跨馆出证，传统环境下，不同地区的档案馆、办事机构、社区服务中心等机构之间无法建立充分的信任关系，但区块链的技术原理可以更好地解决跨机构信任问题，实现信任驱动共享。\n\n**（三）上链时机（When）**\n\n区块链的技术特性能够确保上链后的档案未经非法篡改且可追溯，但其局限性也非常明显，无法保证上链前的档案可信性，因此，上链时机就显得尤为重要。从理论上讲，上链时间越早越有利于实现档案可信，最理想的状态是从档案形成阶段开始上链。但现实情况下还要考虑实际的业务需求和场景。从发展现状来看，上链时机向前延伸可能会成为一种趋势。在档案界的早期探索中，一些档案部门从归档阶段开始实施上链，使其面临着如何解释归档前档案可信性的问题。虽然这一问题在传统环境中就已存在，但人们对区块链给予“厚望”，希望借助新技术推动前端控制的落地，因此，越来越多的档案部门（尤其是企业档案部门）与前端业务部门展开合作，逐步推动从形成阶段开始上链，覆盖档案的形成、办理、整理、归档、著录、保管、查询、处置等关键业务环节。\n\n**（四）参与节点（Who）**\n\n按照区块链系统是否具有节点准入机制，可将其分为许可链与非许可链（即为公有链），许可链可进一步分为私有链和联盟链。对档案机构来说，由于档案信息较为敏感，需在综合考虑安全保密、系统效率（如共识算法的效率）等因素的基础上，在去中心化和中心化之间寻求一种平衡，因此现阶段主要采用的是许可链。在理论层面，相关学者设计的理论模型多以联盟链为主。在实践层面，部分档案机构在起步阶段采用私有链，随着经验的积累，逐步扩展外部节点，将私有链转为联盟链。私有链的优势在于节点位于单一机构内部，较为容易部署实施，但无法实现跨机构的信任；而联盟链能较好地在安全可控和跨机构信任之间实现平衡，因而受到多数档案机构的青睐。例如，中石化在2018年的初步探索期，在公司内部选取北京、南京、东营、武汉、广州五个节点搭建私有链\\[7]，在此基础上吸纳北京市档案局、中国人民大学电子文件管理研究中心、化工学会档案分会、中国标准化研究院标新司法鉴定所、档案系统开发厂商等外部节点加入，将其扩展为联盟链。\n\n**（五）技术选型（How）**\n\n技术选型涉及系统架构、区块结构、共识算法等。在系统架构方面，国内外档案机构大多基于Linux基金会的开源项目超级账本Hyperledger Fabric进行区块链系统的开发、部署和实施。\n\n在区块结构方面，需要考虑档案的存储策略，即将哪些数据实际存储在区块链中。综合加拿大不列颠哥伦比亚大学（UBC）Victoria Louise Lemieux\\[8]和我国国家档案局蔡盈芳\\[9]的观点，可将档案在区块链中的存储模式分为四种类型：一是哈希上链，即仅有档案的哈希值上链；二是元数据上链，即档案的哈希值和部分元数据上链，至于具体选择哪些元数据则视业务需要而定；三是内容上链，即档案本身及元数据和哈希值上链；四是资产上链，除档案本身及其元数据和哈希值上链外，档案所记载的资产（如土地、珠宝等）被编码为凭据（或译为通证、代币）也上链。在应用过程中，应统筹考虑业务需求、安全保密与隐私保护要求、成本（如数据库运行压力、算力消耗、节能减排）等因素，合理选择相应的存储模式。目前，我国档案机构主要采取链上链下混合存储的方式，哈希值和（或）部分元数据上链，档案内容链下存储；但在国际社会，四种类型均有涉及。\n\n在共识算法方面，常见的有PoW、PoS、DPoS、Paxos、PBFT等。比特币、以太坊等公有链项目大多采用PoW，但该算法的性能效率比较低，在私有链和联盟链项目中的适用性不高。因此，档案界的区块链项目大多将DPoS、PBFT等作为共识机制。中国电建等单位还对共识算法作出优化，将PBFT改造为QBFT，极大地提高了共识效率\\[10]。\n\n**思考与展望**\n\n虽然档案界在区块链应用方面已取得一定成效，但仍处于起步阶段，需在以下五个方面展开进一步的理论研究与实践探索。\n\n**第一，强化顶层设计，优化制度供给。**虽然国家档案局连续多年将区块链列入科技项目选题指南，鼓励各地区、各单位开展实践探索，但各项目的思路和方法存在差异，至今尚未形成普遍性的行业共识，缺乏国家层面的指导意见。而国际标准化组织（ISO）的技术报告《与权威记录、记录系统和记录管理相关的区块链和分布式账本技术》（ISO/WD TR 24332）仍处于起草研究阶段，尚未发布，无法为我国档案区块链项目提供参考。因此，应积极推动国家层面的统筹规划和整体布局，构建区块链与档案管理的政策制度与标准规范体系，加强制度规范供给，将现阶段形成的国内外有益经验以制度规范的形式予以固化。\n\n**第二，构建跨行业的档案区块链良性生态。**目前，档案区块链项目的节点数量普遍较少。从行业内部来看，需在纵横两个维度扩展，横向需要联结档案主管部门、档案馆、档案室、档案行业学会、档案服务企业、高校、科研院所等相关机构，纵向需要联结不同层级的各类档案机构。从行业外部来看，需要联结法院、公证与取证机关、税务和审计部门等相关机构，或与司法、税务和审计、数据治理等相关领域的区块链进行跨链融合。例如，中石化已经在规划档案联盟链与法律链的跨链管理\\[11]。此外，档案区块链项目仅靠档案部门是无法实现的，需在项目开展过程中强化与技术公司、高校、科研院所等单位的合作伙伴关系。\n\n**第三，明确区块链在档案可信性保障中的定位。**目前，我国档案机构普遍将区块链视作一种辅助手段，而国外不少档案机构将区块链作为档案管理系统的底层基础设施。从可信性保障的角度来看，前者基本可满足需求，但如果想基于区块链的可信性保障功能探索更多的应用场景，就需要考虑后者。基于区块链等分布式账本技术搭建档案管理系统，必然要思考区块链系统与档案管理系统的差异、如何基于区块链系统实现档案的长期保存功能、如何将档案管理的理论视角与实践要求融入区块链系统等一系列问题。\n\n**第四，针对档案区块链项目面临的管理与技术难题展开重点攻关。**一是上链前的档案可信性保障问题。二是区块链透明可信与隐私保护的平衡问题。三是档案区块链的可持续问题，如果供应商放弃或多数节点离开网络，如何对区块链系统中的档案进行迁移，如何继续维护这些档案的可信性。四是区块链特点与档案管理要求之间的冲突。例如，除档案形成阶段的元数据，档案工作者需要在全流程管理活动中持续添加元数据，且档案保管到期需进行彻底的物理销毁，区块链不可删改等特性使其面临法律合规方面的风险；再如，档案机构在长期保存过程中会定期对档案进行格式迁移，将导致哈希值发生变化，无法完成真实性和完整性校验。五是不同区块链系统间的互操作性有待提高。在缺乏顶层设计的情况下，各地区、各单位建立的区块链系统各自为政，不同系统的底层架构、区块结构等都存在差异，容易形成新的区块链孤岛。六是密码学领域的算法存在更新换代的问题，如果算法被破解或失效，以其为基础的信任机制也将面临巨大挑战。可喜的是，国际档案界已开始探索上述问题的解决方案，例如，英国国家档案馆的ARCHANGEL项目正在研发对格式变化不敏感而对内容变化敏感的哈希算法；Hrvoje Stani等学者为解决添加元数据的需要，提出“双存储系统”的解决方案，档案管理系统将由保持数据不变的区块链核心系统和支持部分可变的支持系统组成\\[12]。\n\n**第五，客观公正地看待区块链在档案可信性保障中的作用。**区块链不是解决档案可信性问题的“万能灵药”，无法解决所有的信任问题。甚至从现实角度来看，技术叠加的越多，其管理复杂性就越高，区块链可能会使现有的档案可信性保障体系变得更加“臃肿”、复杂。因此，部分档案工作者认为档案信任机制不应依赖“外物”，只需通过管理性手段完成信任构建。但数字时代，管理和技术不是非此即彼的关系，而是相伴相生。对档案机构而言，应沉着冷静地识别档案可信性需求，根据实现信任需满足的条件选择合适的信任构建路径与方法，同时在区块链应用的过程中，要重视和规避区块链可能带来的潜在隐患或次生性问题。\n\n参考文献\n\n\\[1]

3.0相关的各类政策。由此，“Web 3.0革命”也就从一场民间自发的运动发展成了一场有国家支持的技术竞争。\n\n在关于Web 3.0的竞争中，美国毫无疑问是最值得关注的一个国家。一方面，在关于Web 3.0的实践方面，美国是最为活跃的。根据CB Insights统计，在2022年第一季度全球的区块链融资中，有63%发生在美国。与此同时，全球一多半的Web 3.0创业公司和投资人也集中在美国。另一方面，在Web 3.0实践丰富的同时，美国遭遇的Web3.0相关问题也是最多的。例如，关于数字资产的定位、DAO的税收义务、稳定币的监管等问题，在美国都已经有了一些案例。\n\n由于这两方面的原因，美国在政策方面对于Web 3.0也给予了很多的关注。2021年12月8日，美国众议院金融服务委员会在国会山举行了一场名为“数字资产和金融的未来：理解美国金融创新的挑战和益处”的听证会。在这场听证会上，前美国货币审计署（OCC）署长、时任BitFury首席执行官的布里安·布鲁克斯（Brian Brooks）向国会议员作了一段关于Web 3.0的汇报。这场报告让在场的议员们认识到了Web 3.0的重要战略意义。从此，“必须确保Web 3.0革命发生在美国”就成了美国决策层的共识。此后，美国陆续在联邦和州层面出台了一系列政策——包括总统行政令、国会立法提议，以及州长行政令等。这些举措，都在某些角度回应Web 3.0发展中的一些问题。\n\n所谓“知己知彼，百战不殆”。目前，我国也是Web 3.0国际竞争中的一员。为了在这场竞争中胜出，我们就必须充分了解包括美国在内的各国Web 3.0发展状况以及它们的政策主张。在本文中，我们就对美国对Web 3.0的几个重要政策进行一些介绍。\n\n## **《关于确保负责任地发展数字资产的行政命令》**\n\n2022年3月9日，美国总统拜登签署了第14067号行政令，即《关于确保负责任地发展数字资产的行政命令》（Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets）。虽然这个行政令的主旨是“确保数字资产负责任地发展”，并没有直接提及Web 3.0，但从内容上看，该行政令却涉及了对待Web 3.0中的关键组成部分——加密资产的态度问题。\n\n具体来说，行政令指出，加密技术的发展使得数字资产获得了迅速的增长，这对消费者、投资者和企业都产生了深远的影响。不过，由于这一领域的创新过于迅速，使得原本的监管框架难以完全应对，这就决定了美国对待数字资产的方法需要进行一次变革。\n\n行政令提出了有关美国数字资产政策的六个政策目标：（a）保护美国的消费者、投资者和企业；（b）保护美国和全球金融稳定，降低系统性风险；（c）减轻滥用数字资产带来的非法金融和国家安全风险；（d）加强美国在全球金融体系以及技术和经济竞争力方面的领导地位，包括通过负责任地发展支付创新和数字资产；（e）促进安全和可负担的金融服务的发展；（f）支持促进负责任地开发和使用数字资产的技术进步。可以看出，在这六项政策目标中，前三个目标是对数字资产可能产生的风险的防范，而后三个目标则是要保护数字资产领域的创新并维持美国在全球金融体系中的领先地位。\n\n为了实现以上的政策目标，行政令提出了一系列的具体安排：\n\n第一，要求财政部等相关机构要制定政策来切实保障美国消费者、投资者和企业的权益。财政部和其他相关机构要评估和制定政策建议，以应对不断增长的数字资产产业和金融市场变化对消费者、投资者、企业以及公平的经济增长 （equitable economic growth）的影响，保护美国消费者、投资者和企业。\n\n第二，鼓励监管机构加大监管力度，以防范数字资产带来的系统性金融风险。鼓励金融稳定监督委员会（Financial Stability Oversight Council）识别和减轻数字资产带来的系统性金融风险，并制定适当的政策建议以解决监管漏洞，保护美国和全球金融稳定并降低系统性风险。\n\n第三，要求所有相关美国政府机构采取前所未有的协调行动，以减轻非法使用数字资产带来的金融和国家安全风险。此外，行政令还指示各机构与盟友及合作伙伴共同合作，以确保国际准则、监管能力和合作伙伴保持一致，并对风险做出响应。\n\n第四，要求商务部在整个美国政府中建立一个框架，以推动美国在数字资产技术方面的竞争力和领导地位，并利用数字资产技术，加强美国在全球金融体系中的领导地位。该框架将作为各机构的基础，并将其作为优先事项纳入其数字资产的政策、研发和运营方法中。\n\n第五，要求财政部长负责牵头研究数字资产在普惠金融方面的创新应用和影响。行政命令指出，安全、可负担和可获得（safe,affordable,and accessible）的金融服务是符合美国国家利益的，必须要对数字资产创新方法提供信息，包括不同的影响风险。财政部长要与相关机构合作，编写一份关于货币和支付系统未来的报告，包括对经济增长、金融增长和包容性、国家安全的影响，以及技术创新对未来的影响程度。\n\n第六，在支持技术创新的同时确保负责任地开发和使用数字资产。美国政府要采取具体措施，研究和支持负责任地开发、设计和实施数字资产系统方面的技术进步，同时优先考虑隐私、安全、打击非法利用，并减少对生态环境的影响。\n\n除此之外，行政令还专门要求联储等相关机构要对央行数字货币（Central Bank Digital Currencies，简称CBDCs）进行积极的探索。行政令指出，拜登政府将关于设计和部署CBDC的研究发放在“最高的紧要”的位置。这些研究所关注的内容应当包括对消费者、投资者和企业可能的利益和风险的评估、金融稳定和系统性风险、支付系统、国家安全、行使人权的能力、金融包容性和公平性，以及启动CBDC所需采取的行动。\n\n可以看到，拜登的行政令主要是希望给发展和监管数字资产的政策确立一个总体的框架，因而其涉及的具体政策主张并不多。但这个行政令中体现出的稳定与发展并举的态度是十分值得借鉴的。另外，行政令中重点关注的CBDC、金融普惠、金融风险防范等问题，也为我国考虑的政策指向提供了很好的参考。\n\n## **《负责任的金融创新法案》**\n\n2022年6月7日，美国共和党参议员辛西娅·鲁米斯（Cynthia Lummis）和民主党参议员柯尔斯藤·吉利布兰德（Kirsten Gillibrand）共同提出了一份长达168页的跨党派的立法提案——《负责任的金融创新法案》（The Responsible Financial Innovation Act），旨在为数字资产创建一个完整的监管框架。如果说，拜登的行政令是“重在务虚”的话，那么这个立法提案就是试图“务实”地回应Web 3.0监管中遇到的一些问题。\n\n这份法案包括七个部分——\n\n**（a）负责任的数字资产税收（Responsible Taxation of Digital Assets）**\n\nWeb 3.0产生了很多新的组织模式和商业模式，这些创新对传统的税法体系产生了很多的冲击。应该如何对新的组织、新的收入来源征税，怎样征税？已经成为了一个非常现实的问题。而在这一部分，法案就试图对这些问题进行一些回应。具体来说，这部分有如下几个重要规定：\n\n第一，明确了因在个人交易（personal transaction）中使用加密货币而产生的损益不应该被计入总收入，因而也不应该作为征税的依据。这里，所谓的“个人交易”是根据《美国法典》（UScode）第988条中规定给出的，它指的是价值不超过200美元的交易。\n\n第二，明确了去中心化自治组织（Decentralized Autonomous Organization，简称DAO）是税法意义上的商业实体，其收入应当按照税法规定纳税。\n\n第三，明确了在因“挖矿”（mining）或“质押”（staking）而获得的资产收益被处置之前，这部分收益不应该被作为应税收入。\n\n第四，明确了数字资产借贷应参照现行的证券借贷规定，不应该被视为是应税行为。不过，对在借贷完成之后，贷方所获得的那部分超过其自行持有情形下所能获得的超额收益，则应该被视为是应税收入。\n\n第五，明确了因分叉（fork）、空投（airdrop）以及类似的补贴所获得的收入应当被视为是应税收入。\n\n**（b）负责任的证券创新（Responsible Securities Innovation）**\n\n这一部分法案主要探讨了数字资产是否应该被定性为证券的问题。\n\n随着Web 3.0的发展，越来越多的个人和团体都开始发行通证（包括同质化通证和NFT）。这些通证应该如何定性，一直是项目运营者们关注的一个问题。这是因为，在美国，如果这些发行的物品被视为是证券，就意味着它们需要去美国证券交易委员会（Securities and Exchange Commission，简称SEC）注册，并接受SEC监管。\n\n在现行的法律框架下，判断一个产品是否属于证券主要采用“豪威测试”（Howey Test）。这个测试源于1946年的“SEC诉豪威案”（SEC v.Howey），在该案中，法院认为要判断特定交易是否构成证券发行需要考虑四个要件：是否存在资金投资；是否投资于共同事业；是否存在对投资利益的期待；是否依赖第三方的努力获得利益。如果某个金融产品对以上四个问题的回答都是“是”，那它就会被认定为是证券，需要到SEC注册，并接受SEC监管。根据豪威测试，很多加密通证都存在着被认为是证券的风险。例如，在先前的一个案例中，SEC就据此认定瑞波币属于证券，并以“未经注册发行证券”为由起诉了瑞波的两名高管。\n\n在法案的这一部分，引入了一个“辅助资产”（ancillary assets）的概念。它被定义为：“通过构成投资合同的安排或计划，向买卖该资产的人发行、出售或以其他方式提供的一种无形的、可替代的资产”。根据法案的描述，辅助资产不能给予其持有人对任何商业实体的债权、股权、清算权、分红权或其他金融权利。\n\n法案认为，根据《大宗商品交易法》（Commodity Exchange Act）和《投资公司法》（Investment Company Act）的相关规定，在投资合同项下提供给购买者的辅助资产原则上应该被认定是大宗商品，而不应该被认定为是证券。据此，它们应该归商品期货交易委员会（Commodity Futures Trading Commission，简称CFTC），而非SEC监管。\n\n需要指出的是，尽管法案认为对辅助资产的管辖权应该主要划归CFTC，但仍然认为其他监管机构可以对其保留一定程度的监督和控制。比如，它要求辅助资产的发行方每年两次向SEC披露其要求的公司基本信息和辅助资产特定信息，只有在符合这些披露要求后辅助资产才会被认定为大宗商品而非证劵。不过，考虑到现实中的一些辅助资产是通过完全去中心化的方式发行的，法案免除了完全去中心化的辅助资产发行方（指“过去12个月内其发行的相关辅助资产的价值不依赖于该发行方或其控制的实体的创业或管理努力”）的披露义务，规定其无需就向SEC进行相关披露。\n\n根据以上论述，我们不难看到，市场上的大多数不具有股权、分红权等权益的加密资产（包括各种通证）都可以被归入到辅助资产的范畴，并从法律意义上被视为大宗商品而非证券。所以，其面临的监管义务将会要少上很多。\n\n**（c）负责任的商品创新（Responsible Commodities Innovation）**\n\n法案的这一部分主要是接续前一部分，对作为大宗商品的数字资产的相关问题进行了一些规定。具体来说，这部分有如下值得关注的论述：\n\n第一，法案对“数字资产”和“数字资产交易”的监管框架及监管机构进行了明确。\n\n由于法案认为大部分数字资产作为辅助资产，应该被纳入大宗商品的范畴，因此对“数字资产”和“数字资产交易”的监管应该被纳入《大宗商品交易法》所规定的框架之下，并且CFTC应该对非证券的同质（fungible）数字资产（包括辅助资产）的现货市场拥有“排他性的管辖权”（exclusive jurisdiction）。此外，法案允许期货经纪商进行数字资产活动，并明确了资产托管和客户保护方面的监管要求，而期货交易本身就是受CFTC监管的。因此，如果法案通过，那么CFTC就会成为数字资产的主要监管机构。\n\n需要说明的是，法案专门做了说明，数字藏品（digital collectibles）以及“独有数字资产”（unique digital assets）并不能视为是大宗商品，其监管也不能被列入以上框架。这意味着，《大宗商品交易法》所确立的监管框架并不能覆盖我们熟悉的NFT，并且CFTC对其也没有管辖权。\n\n第二，法案对数字交易所的相关问题进行了规定。\n\n法案将数字资产交易所（digital asset exchange）定义为“提供至少一种数字资产交易的交易设施”，并要求它们在提供交易服务之前必须在CFTC进行注册。法案规定，数字资产交易所只能为不易受操控的数字资产提供交易服务。除非它同时注册为指定合约市场或掉期合约执行机构，否则不能提供衍生品交易。\n\n法案要求数字资产交易所在提供交易服务时必须对数字资产的目的、创造和释放过程、共识机制、治理结构、参与和持有者分布、现有及预期的功能等问题进行细致考虑。这就使得交易所必须更为审慎地对待数字资产的发行问题，并把控法律风险。\n\n法案对交易所不当利用客户资金进行了限制，要求加密资产交易所托管的客户资产必须和自持资产分开管理，严禁将客户资产用作向其他人提供保证金、担保、抵押或其他目的。\n\n法案要求数字资产交易所必须向CFTC报告，及时向公众披露有关加密资产的价格、交易量和其他交易数据，建立风险控制制度，具有良好的财务状况和管理能力，并至少拥有满足最终的有序清算（orderly wind-down）所需的财务资源。\n\n第三，法案对破产过程中数字资产的待遇问题进行了规定。\n\n法案认为，在破产程序中，数字资产的待遇应该与大宗商品类似，在破产程序中受到类似的保护。\n\n**（d）负责任的消费者保护（Responsible Consumer Protection）**\n\n这部分主要对提供数字资产服务的机构和人员应该对消费者担负的责任进行了规定。具体来说，这部分规定了如下重要问题：\n\n第一，数字资产提供商被要求在用户协议中明确披露与其产品相关的信息，包括破产程序中的资产待遇、亏损风险、费用、赎回等。\n\n第二，数字资产服务提供商被要求向用户提供数字资产所使用的源代码及其法律地位的相关信息，包括属于证券还是属于商品。\n\n第三，法案要求数字资产服务提供商和用户就交易结算的终局性条款达成一致，包括数字资产在什么条件下被视为已完全转让。\n\n第四，法案要求对数字资产中介机构和存款机构适用更高标准的披露要求，法案授权联邦和州的相关政府部门制定具体规则。\n\n第五，法案明确授予个人保留和控制其拥有的数字资产的权利。\n\n**（e）负责任的支付创新（Responsible Payment Innovation）**\n\n在法案的这一部分，主要对加密支付手段，尤其是支付稳定币的监管问题作出了规定。由于不久之前，包括UST在内的几个重要稳定币陆续“暴雷”，因而这一部分的规定有较强的指向性。具体来说，这一部分有如下主要内容：\n\n第一，对支付稳定币的发行进行了规定。\n\n法案要求，支付稳定币的发行人必须满足如下条件：（1）维持优质的流动性资产，其价值为已发行稳定币面值的 100%，也就是所有稳定币必须有相应的足额资产储备，不允许有低额抵押的稳定币；（2）必须公开披露支撑稳定币的资产及其价值；（3）要求有以法币按面值赎回所有已发行稳定币的能力。\n\n简而言之，只有具备存款机构牌照的主体才可以发行稳定币，并且稳定币必须以足额等值资产作支撑。应该说，这一要求是非常高的。如果按照这个要求，现有的几种主要稳定币都很难满足。比如，USDT可能会因信息披露问题而遭遇麻烦，而各种算法稳定币则会因为没有足额储备而不合要求。\n\n第二，法案规定要确保现有稳定币发行人和市场新进者有充分机会，在稳定币发行方面与现有银行和信用合作社竞争。根据法案，已经在州层面获得相关牌照的稳定币发行人就可以获得联邦层面的稳定币发行所需要的许可。\n\n第三，法案要求财政部下属的外国资产控制办公室制定相关指引，明确稳定币发行人在遵守美国政府制裁令方面的合规责任和义务，以防止外国政府、企业和个人利用稳定币逃避美国政府制裁。\n\n第四，法案要求总统下属的行政管理和预算局会同网络安全和基础设施安全局局长、国家情报局局长和国防部长，对在美国政府设备上使用数字人民币制定安全防范措施。\n\n尽管这一条具有很强的反华政治意味，但也从另一面提醒我们，在Web 3.0的竞争中，CBDC或许会是一个重要的竞争战场。\n\n第五，法案规定货币监理署可以特许国家银行协会发行稳定币，并制定有关经营范围、资本充足率、会员出资以及复兴方案等规范。这一条，或许是在为美国版CBDC的出台进行准备。\n\n**（f）负责任的银行创新（Responsible Banking Innovation）**\n\n法案的这一部分主要对Web 3.0技术应用于银行业所产生的一系列问题进行规定。具体来说，这部分做出了如下规定：\n\n第一，要求美联储理事会对如何利用分布式账本技术（Distributed Ledger Technology）来降低存款机构的风险，包括降低结算/操作风险和资本充足要求等问题进行研究。\n\n第二，要求联邦储备银行向包括稳定币发行机构在内的存款机构提供支付、清算和结算服务。\n\n第三，要求美联储理事会应当向包括稳定币发行机构在内的存款机构发放汇款路由号码（Routing Transit Number）。\n\n第四，要求联邦金融机构审查委员会在 18个月内制定存款机构数字资产活动的审查标准。在联邦法律中首次制定了存款机构资产托管的共同准则。\n\n第五，禁止在存款机构的审查评级中使用声誉风险。联邦银行监管部门要求或命令终止某个客户账户时，应给予适当理由。\n\n**（g）负责任的部际协调（Responsible Interagency Coordination）**\n\n这部分讨论的主要是在发展和监管Web 3.0所产生的各种问题时所涉及的跨部门协调问题。在这一部分，法案主要进行了如下规定：\n\n第一，要求财政部研究与去中心化金融相关的课题。\n\n第二，要求各州银行监管机构在2年内对数字资产的法律地位采取基本统一的标准。\n\n第三，允许在现有州金融科技沙盒中运营的金融公司在特定的消费者保护和业务规范下，在获得相应州和联邦监管机构的批准后，跨州开展业务。\n\n第四，要求联邦能源监管委员会与CFTC和SEC协商，对数字资产行业的能源消耗进行专题研究，包括挖矿和质押所消耗的能源类型和数量，以及如何使用可再生能源。\n\n第五，要求CFTC和SEC与数字资产中介机构和数字资产行业进行协商，研究数字资产市场的自律监管，并形成设立数字资产协会的提案。\n\n第六，要求 CFTC和SEC与财政部长会商，为数字资产中介机构制定有关网络安全的全面的原则性的指南，包括安全运营、风险识别和防范、规避制裁和洗钱等。\n\n第七，要求成立旨在研究并向监管机构报告不断发展的数字资产市场的金融创新咨询委员会，以便跟进行业和监管需求的变化而调整和修改法规。\n\n## **加州州长第N-9-22号行政令**\n\n无论是拜登的行政令，还是《负责任的金融创新法案》，都是美国联邦层面的政策尝试。而在联邦积极探索相关政策的同时，美国的各州也在积极推出各种政策，以争夺在Web 3.0领域的先机。其中，2022年5月4日，加州州长加文·纽森姆（Gavin Newsom）签署的第N-9-22号行政命令是最有代表性的。\n\n这项行政令的主要目的是为 Web 3.0公司创造一个透明的监管和商业环境，并协调联邦和加州法律，平衡消费者的利益和风险，融入公平、包容和环保等加州的价值观。加州方面认为，根据该命令和 2020年通过的《加州消费者金融保护法》，该州将为区块链相关公司创造一个“透明和一致的商业环境”。\n\n具体来说，这项行政令强调了七项工作：\n\n第一，加州要为在区块链中运营的公司（包括加密资产和相关金融技术）创造一个透明和一致的商业环境，协调联邦和加州的法律，平衡消费者的利益和风险，并融入公平、包容和环保等加州价值观。\n\n第二，加州的政府机构必须参与总统关于数字资产的行政令同步的过程，以收集反馈。在联邦和州当局之间创造协调的加密资产监管方法。\n\n第三，加州的政府机构必须从广泛的利益相关者那里收集潜在区块链应用和商业机遇信息，对加密资产和相关金融技术予以特别关注。这些利益相关者应包括加州内外的公司、弱势社区、技术专家、风险投资公司、有兴趣解决不平等和环境影响的利益相关者以及其他人。\n\n第四，参与公共程序，以制定与联邦法规方向一致的加密资产综合监管方案，对消费者进行保护。\n\n第五，通过与华盛顿方面的密切合作，推进总统行政令中的部署，实现并鼓励监管的明确性。\n\n第六，探索部署区块链技术以解决公共服务和新兴需求的机会。与私营部门、学术界和社区合作，提出创新政策、计划和解决方案的试点，展示用区块链技术应对挑战的潜力。\n\n第七，识别科学研究和劳动力环境中的蕴含机会，推动区块链技术（包括加密资产）的创新。让学生接触新兴机会，为新兴产业提供动力，并帮助确保公平地获得经济利益。\n\n可以看到，作为州一级的政策，加州行政令更多强调了和联邦层面的配合。与此同时，在监管与发展之间，这个行政令更多突出了对发展的鼓励。其中，对于创业环境的塑造，以及从研究和劳动力市场挖掘机会等举措，都是值得我国的地方政府在发展Web 3.0的相关过程中借鉴的。不过，和拜登的行政令一样，加州的行政令主要还是侧重于“务虚”，其主要目的还是建立政策框架。至于具体的政策措施，还有待进一步观察。\n\n## **结语**\n\n作为目前Web 3.0发展最快的国家，美国无论是在联邦还是州层面都陆续推出了很多与Web 3.0相关的政策。从这些政策容易看出，美国确实已经把Web 3.0，尤其是与之相关的金融发展作为了未来国际和区域竞争的一个重要争夺点。\n\n所谓“他山之石，可以攻玉”。美国遭遇的很多问题，是我们在发展Web 3.0的过程中同样会遇到的。从这个意义上讲，及时了解美国的政策动态，对我们发展Web 3.0、在Web 3.0的竞争中赢得先机，是非常有价值的。\n", "timestamp": 1658207430, "digest":

Lighthouse 节点出现了没同步的情况，直到下一个 epoch 才赶上，修复程序已在进行中。\n2.  Besu:5 个节点中有 4 个遇到了无效区块，看起来像之前遇到的问题。\n3.  Nethermind 离线（故意），在 第 8 次主网影子分叉中，他们遇到了在 Ropsten 上看到的问题，因此在第 9 次主网影子分叉中，他们运行了许多不同的配置来尝试重现它，然后他们成功地做到了这一点。\n4.  Erigon 节点未及时同步，将在以后的测试中使用快照。\n5.  Nimbus 节点：Pari 搞砸了配置。\n\n所以，这次影子分叉有点颠簸，一旦 Nimbus 配置被修复，区块链就成功地获得了最终性。\n\n鉴于即将到来的 Goerli–Prater 合并，下一次影子分叉将于下周在 Goerli 上进行，而第 10 次主网影子分叉将在一周后进行。\n\n在测试合并时，不要忘记，如果你计划使用 MEV-Boost，它也需要进行测试，Flashbots 对此有一些信息‌。\n\n## 合并准备工作\n\n这是本周的新板块，现在我们知道合并肯定会发生，质押者和非质押者都需要开始做好准备。\n\n为此，Superphiz 围绕合并进行了很多教育工作‌。\n\n在接下来的几周内，Infura 将举办一系列关于合并各个方面的研讨会，你可以在 Crowdcast 上关注 ConsenSys 以接收有关会话何时开始的更新信息并查看过去会话的记录。我听说第一次会议取得了巨大的成功，有超过 9000 人参加或观看了。\n\n另外，出色的 beaconcha.in 移动应用现在有了一个合并准备清单‌，而 Launchpad 也有自己的合并准备检查列表‌。\n\n## 关于质押（Staking）\n\n在过去的几周里，Lido 的辩解者已经在播客上大显身手，作为对比，我发现 Ryan Berckmans 和 Alexandre Bergeron 的 Unchained 播客‌很有见地。Ryan 在 41 分 39 秒左右开始的辩解非常出色，总的来说，整期播客都非常棒。\n\n> “我认为这将是一场漫长的以太坊灵魂之战……Lido 中心化可能是有史以来出现的最大问题，这可能是自 DAO 分叉以来最大的社区问题，从长远来看，这是一个非常具有潜在破坏性的问题。“\n\n以及：\n\n> “当你分配到 Lido 时，你可能会降低以太坊的价值，因为以太坊的价值是其可信中立性的一个函数。”\n\n在其他地方，你可能在本周看到了这种愚蠢的自我推销‌，并对此过度担忧。事实证明，“重大攻击漏洞”是一个众所周知的问题，并且像这样在推特上发布它是愚蠢的。关键是可以发现 ETH2 验证者的 IP 地址，这可以用于 DDoS 阻止提议者，例如窃取他们的 MEV。现在有多种方法‌可以抵御这种情况，但正确的长期解决方案是单一秘密 leader 选举。然而，SSLE 仍处于研究阶段，我希望看到这方面的更多进展。\n\n声明：本文内容为作者独立观点，不代表碳链价值立场，且不构成任何投资理财建议。\n\n## 相关推荐\n\n<!--相关内容-->\n", "timestamp": 1658207435, "digest": "taF4m4WLUV2JBuNmTgGXxkOEiJX7rChR5EkrbES2lzU", "contributor": "0x176F737ea8605fe5ADE5733fd3297fd5F72905bf"}

In the spirit of building in the open with the community, we have prioritized getting community feedback quickly with this initial release.\n\nIf you’d like to be an early tester, sign up at [signup.scroll.io](https://signup.scroll.io) for access.  We will invite as many testers as possible while we drive towards a permissionless, public release.\n\n## **What’s in the pre-alpha testnet?**\n\nThis initial release will be run on a private PoA fork of Ethereum (the testnet L1) operated by Scroll. On top of this private chain, we will run a testnet Scroll L2 supporting the following features:\n\n* Users will be able to play with a few key demo applications such as a Uniswap fork with familiar web interfaces such as Metamask.\n* Users will be able to view the state of the Scroll testnet via block explorers.\n* Scroll will run a node that supports unlimited read operations (e.g. getting the state of accounts) and user-initiated transactions involving interactions with the pre-deployed demo applications (e.g. transfers of ERC-20 tokens or swaps of tokens).\n* Rollers will generate and aggregate validity proofs for part of the zkEVM circuits to ensure a stable release. In the next testnet phase, we will ramp up this set of zkEVM circuits.\n* Bridging assets between these testnet L1 and L2s will be enabled through a smart contract bridge, though arbitrary message passing will not be supported in this release.\n\nScroll’s pre-alpha testnet will be the first chance for early users and developers to interact with our infrastructure and experience dapp workflows on Scroll. As we scale our node infrastructure, we will relax some of the performance-motivated restrictions and onboard more testers.\n\n## **What’s next for Scroll?**\n\nSoon after our pre-alpha testnet, we will be deploying a more open and permissionless alpha testnet. This will be deployed on a public Ethereum testnet and will be open to the public. In particular, our community can expect the following features:\n\n* Allowing developers to deploy smart contracts\n* Allowing anyone to run an archival Scroll node\n* Generating and aggregating more pieces of the zkEVM proof to be verified on-chain\n\nAs we move step by step towards an eventual mainnet release, we will enable successively more pieces of our final architecture, including a decentralized Roller network and integrations with EVM-native developer tools. In the next few weeks, we will release a series of expository articles and posts explaining Scroll’s architecture and the technical vision that has informed Scroll’s development decisions.  Stay tuned to learn more about these!\n\n## Scroll’s Release Philosophy\n\nScroll’s plan for scaling Ethereum and serving billions of users and developers is a long-term roadmap that requires careful consideration and execution. We firmly believe in the future of the zkEVM as a key to scaling Ethereum, and as such, are committed to releasing it in a way that allows us to work through any challenges in a focused manner and incorporate feedback alongside our roadmap.\n\nBy giving users, developers and the broader community progressively more functionality to test instead of releasing all features at once, we aim to isolate any bugs and UX difficulties early and often, allowing us to build towards the most robust, scalable solution that will stand the test of time.\n\n## 📜Join us and learn more\n\nTo become an early tester or contributor, sign up to try out our pre-alpha testnet at [signup.scroll.io](https://signup.scroll.io). In the meantime, if our vision of scaling Ethereum in an open and community-driven way resonates with you, we are looking for values-aligned individuals to help Scroll become the most developer- and user-friendly scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\n* If you are a ZK researcher, ZKP, Go or Solidity developer, or a GPU engineer, we are working on many interesting technical challenges at the edge of what’s possible. Come build cutting-edge solutions to these problems with us in the open!\n* If you love nurturing and growing ecosystems or communities, we are looking for developer advocates and community organizers to make sure we are building in a community-aligned and user-friendly way.\n\nTo learn more about these roles and about Scroll, check out our [website](https://scroll.io/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP), [Discord](https://discord.gg/CNzNVt4Feu), or [jobs page](https://jobs.lever.co/ScrollFoundation).

**正文**\n\n**元宇宙与金融：虚实交融共进下的金融体系**\n\n**元宇宙与金融融合发展的两条路径：“元宇宙金融”vs.“金融元宇宙”**\n\n参考中金TMT组报告《[元宇宙：空间升维、时间延展、社会重构](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?\\__biz=MzI3MDMzMjg0MA==\\&mid=2247578345\\&idx=1\\&sn=6b67d45f9c064199cce9f5b57343a584\\&chksm=ead1542edda6dd38aec888e599400573637a76e362f8ccd291d9da4ef6ee0995f95351852434\\&scene=21#wechat_redirect)》，元宇宙是由混合现实和数字建模等技术为基础、以去中心化思想构建的、拥有崭新经济、身份、制度体系的数字世界。由于“元宇宙的虚拟世界”代表了我们对“新生活”的渴望以及对未知世界无限的想象力，我们在畅想时让其包罗万象、以便饱含所有人的期待。然而对于想参与元宇宙建设的传统金融机构而言，这样的虚拟世界未免太过遥远、切入点较为模糊。从现实角度出发，我们认为金融体系与元宇宙的融合发展更多源自于元宇宙底层技术的发展与场景的延伸，并基于技术和场景为金融体系带来新的发展机遇。\n\n近年来，以加密货币为代表的去中心化金融体系在部分海外国家发展迅速，但也引发了许多争议。部分观点认为伴随元宇宙概念的逐步成熟，或产生以加密货币、“DeFi”为底座、融合去中心化思想的金融体系，也有观点认为加密货币是没有价值的泡沫，元宇宙与金融的融合归根到底还是要落足现实发展。而与此同时，我们也看到越来越多的金融机构将元宇宙作为数字化转型的抓手之一，一方面深入元宇宙内部、尝试围绕元宇宙的发展去探索新的金融服务，另一方面则重点着眼于利用元宇宙的相关技术和场景来赋能其数字化转型、拓展新的渠道。\n\n**因此，我们认为，金融与元宇宙的融合发展可以分为两条路径：**1）“元宇宙金融”：基于对元宇宙的定义，我们认为元宇宙中的金融体系将以去中心化思想和分布式账本技术（如区块链）为基石，以支付为起点，逐渐发展到借贷、交易等各细分金融活动领域，并进一步向资产确权、社会组织等维度拓展，进而为去中心化框架下的元宇宙经济活动提供支持；2）“金融元宇宙”：在金融机构数字化转型持续加速的背景下，元宇宙底层技术的成熟以及其场景的不断延伸有望进一步推动金融机构数字化转型、为其数字化转型路径及最终形态带来更多的可能性。\n\n**“元宇宙金融”：在去中心化叙事框架下为元宇宙经济活动提供支持**\n\n整体上，元宇宙金融近年来发展迅速，表现为用户规模快速扩张、产品功能不断创新、服务维度持续扩展，但与传统金融体系相比，其规模仍相对较小，且对实体经济的渗透率仍在低位，目前尚未能广泛服务于现实中的金融需求，未来前景仍有一定的不确定性。\n\n同时，元宇宙金融也面临着来自技术、市场、运营、监管等多方面的挑战和风险，包括：1）技术应用层面的缺陷导致元宇宙金融内部存在结构性问题；2）运营治理层面的权力过度中心化和低效率使元宇宙金融丧失竞争力和吸引力；3）市场结构层面的过度投机交易和高杠杆引发系统性风险，冲击元宇宙金融的信任和共识；4）各国监管政策差异较大，导致元宇宙金融的发展出现割裂。\n\n展望未来，我们认为在当前国家主权和社会形态下，完全去中心化的元宇宙金融体系难以广泛存在，但是其去中心化的理念、区块链及智能合约的技术、以及部分模式的创新等仍能为金融体系的发展提供有益参考。\n\n同时，我们认为，未来的元宇宙金融可能是构建在中央银行及其他监管机构基础之上、以中心化和非中心化的金融机构为运营主体、更加透明、更加高效、更加普惠的金融体系。而在元宇宙与传统金融体系交融共进的过程中，当前元宇宙金融或将逐步纳入监管框架、搭建合规入口、提升金融系统稳定性，同时其也有望赋能传统金融体系，持续优化传统金融服务效率和体验，推动减少中介代理问题、降低系统运营成本和用户准入门槛。\n\n**“金融元宇宙”：元宇宙技术及场景为金融机构数字化转型提供更多可能性**\n\n从实际角度出发，伴随金融机构数字化转型的持续加速，我们认为“元宇宙”对于传统金融机构的现实意义更多源自于其底层技术的不断成熟以及其场景不断延伸带来的想象力，有望进一步推动金融机构进行数字化转型、为其数字化转型的路径及最终形态带来更多的丰富的可能性及想象空间。\n\n一方面，伴随“元宇宙”逐步向前发展，其底层技术例如建模渲染、交互技术、物联网、网络算力、区块链、人工智能等技术的应用有望加速落地，我们认为金融机构将受益于相关技术的快速发展、更好地实现业务创新、流程改造、组织变革等数字化转型目标；另一方面，“元宇宙”为我们勾勒出一幅具有数字原生能力、甚至具有完备经济与社交体系的虚拟世界图景，我们认为“元宇宙”带来的沉浸式体验感以及虚拟元素的真实感将为金融机构线上协作、线上展业以及客户体验升级等方面提供更丰富的想象空间。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/4fd5fe35f2438fbbd286682881bdbe5d.jpg)\n\n**元宇宙金融发展迅速但尚存较多挑战，未来或可与中心化体系交融共进**\n\n**元宇宙金融体系发展迅速，但存在“脱实向虚” 的趋势和资产泡沫**\n\n在去中心化的叙事框架下，元宇宙金融体系以基础支付为起点，逐渐发展到借贷、交易等各细分金融活动领域，并进一步向资产确权、社会组织等维度拓展。整体上，元宇宙金融近年来发展迅速，但与传统金融体系相比，其规模仍相对较小，未来前景仍有一定的不确定性。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/ebacfd6debe875c4076de88bc7054b6e.jpg)\n\n支付清算：“脱实向虚”的加密货币\n\n比特币作为加密货币的起点，在创立之初被设计为能够脱离中介机构运行的一种点对点电子现金系统。然而，虽然在过去的十年间，加密货币种类出现爆发式增长，整体市值也增长至2021年底的2.37万亿美元，但其用途主要集中在加密经济内的投机交易领域，而较少赋能实体经济中的支付清算环节，呈现“脱实相虚”趋势、并形成了较大的价格泡沫。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/54d1bf57264facb0f0ba9943464aecb9.jpg)\n\n**我们认为，加密货币与支付清算活动的脱钩，或主因：**1）缺乏内在价值且没有中心化机构背书使其难以使其承担货币职能；2）去中心化的支付清算体系存在“不可能三角”，加密货币难以同时保证安全性和实现规模化；3）当前数字化支付清算体系已较为高效，且已构建较为牢固的双边网络和用户习惯，加密货币难以与其竞争。\n\n**首先，加密货币币值波动大、且大部分没有内在价值，难以承担基础货币职能。**加密货币主要依靠没有中介机构背书的不稳定“共识”形成价格。然而，由于大部分加密货币与实体经济脱钩、没有内在价值，其投资者的“共识”难以保持稳定，导致加密货币价格波动较大，难以承担基础货币职能。而其吸引而来的后续投机者进一步推动投机交易、形成恶性循环，使得具备点对点去中心化支付功能的加密货币脱离了真实的支付清算需求。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/3ebc467dc473b422ee635c1364d02899.jpg)\n\n**其次，在去中心化的基础上，加密货币目前面临同时保障安全性并实现规模化的挑战。**建立在公链之上、完全去中心化的加密货币需要提供合理的激励来吸引参与者（如“矿工”）支持公链的运行。而伴随公链规模扩大、性能提升，其交易成本或将下滑并带动经济激励边际下降。因此，为实现进一步的规模化，去中心化的公链需要建立既能够支持规模扩张和性能升级、又能够持续提供较高激励的经济机制。而跨链协议虽然能够加强各区块链之间的互操作性、提升区块链交易规模上限，但目前在安全保障方面仍有提升空间。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/317fffd55781fb58b209fd9be81b87fc.jpg)\n\n**最后，现存的数字化支付清算体系已较为高效，加密货币或难以在支付领域实现颠覆。**1）在支付性能方面，由于加密货币在技术设计上以保障去中心化共识和安全为主要目标，其相对于头部电子支付公司仍有一定差距；2）在双边网络规模方面，当前加密货币对实体经济的渗透率仍在低位、且更多依靠电子支付公司（如Shopify、Visa）等提供支持，支付交易仍运作在中心化系统上；3）在用户习惯方面，银行卡、电子钱包仍是数字化支付方式的首选，即使用户体验相近，加密货币也难以颠覆较为牢固的用户习惯。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/c0c0da10b64565c4c9573a8d1ef4da10.jpg)\n\nDeFi：对传统金融体系的不完全映射\n\n去中心化金融（DeFi）概念诞生于2018年，Brendan Forster在《Announcing De.Fi , A Community for Decentralized Finance Platforms》中宣告了DeFi概念的诞生：一个建立在去中心化区块链基础之上、完全开源且拥有稳定开发者平台的金融体系。\n\n整体上，DeFi不依赖于券商、交易所或银行等中心化的中介机构，而是利用区块链上的智能合约完成金融交易。“理想化的DeFi”的核心特征在于任何参与方都不能够单方面进行：1）账户的控制；2）对于交易执行的审查；3）对于协议执行的审查。\n\n截止至2022年6月底，根据Statista的数据，DeFi的总锁仓规模（TVL）达到770.5亿美元，整体活跃账户达482.5万个，但其对经济活动和金融服务的渗透率仍相对较低，TVL约占上年全球GDP的0.08%，链下金融服务体系（根据Business Research Company \\~26万亿美元）的0.3%。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/6a51387a1f39283584e31dd686032618.jpg)\n\n**在运作机制上，DeFi并非完全独立于现实世界的“空中楼阁”。**其通过稳定币和预言机与链下金融体系挂钩，使得链上资产能够有效地与链下互通，并对现实世界中的各种变量做出反应。\n\n**►稳定币：连通实体经济与加密经济的资金通道和价值尺度。**稳定币作为法币与加密货币间的交易媒介，规避了加密货币与法币直接兑换的限制，便利链上与链下的资金流通，同时也依靠相对稳定的币值成为了加密经济中的资产“避风港”。根据锚定的对象和运作机制的不同，稳定币主要分为以下三种类型：\n\n· 以链下资产为抵押物的稳定币：该类稳定币通常以法币、贵金属等链下资产作为抵押。其中的代表是Tether公司发行的USDT。USDT是目前市场占比最大的稳定币，截至2022年6月底，占所有稳定币市值的43.64%。每发行1单位的USDT，公司都会相应地在其银行账户上存入1美元，用户可以随时使用USDT与USD进行1:1兑换。发行人通常会聘请独立的审计机构定期对托管账户中的支持资产进行验证。其他大市值的链下支持稳定币还包括USDC、BUSD等。\n\n· 以链上资产为抵押物的稳定币：该类稳定币以ETH等其他加密货币作为抵押物，抵押物由智能合约持有，用户能够存入加密货币抵押物并换取稳定币或存入稳定币赎回抵押物。因为加密资产的价值往往波动较法币更大，用户通常需要以高于1：1的比率超额存入抵押物。该类稳定币包括DAI等。\n\n· 无抵押物的算法稳定币：该类稳定币依据算法调整市场货币总量，在稳定币价格高于锚定价格时增加市场供给，在稳定币价格低于锚定价格时时回收供给，或者基于套利交易平衡稳定币价格，但隐含风险相对较大。\n\n**►预言机：连通实体经济与加密经济的信息通道。**区块链本身是一个闭环系统，智能合约无法主动获取外部数据。而预言机（Oracle）能够将外界信息写入到区块链内，使得智能合约能够对现实世界的信息做出反应，从而完成区块链与现实世界的数据互通。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/b9e02101ec738f6197f125d8b487032b.jpg)\n\n**与当前中心化的金融体系相比， DeFi理论上在成本、效率、透明度、安全性、开放包容性、隐私保护等多个方面具有优势。然而，当前DeFi生态仍处于发展初期，金融体系尚未完善且隐含较大风险。**\n\n首先，DeFi生态内对杠杆交易的限制较少，过高的杠杆在加密货币价格发生剧烈波动时或引发连锁式平仓，且有可能引发DeFi的系统性危机。例如2021年5月的ETH大幅下跌与2022年Luna暴雷事件中，DeFi的总锁仓市值日内缩水幅度分别达到-37.5%与-46%。\n\n其次，恶性漏洞与黑客攻击使得DeFi生态的安全性和信任力屡受挑战。例如，2022年3月，热门游戏Axie Infinity的底层跨链桥Ronin被攻击，损失达6.25亿美元，而根据 Elliptic报告，2021 年全年DeFi生态因被盗而损失了 15.5亿美元。\n\n非同质化代币（NFT）：资产确权、价值赋能的底层基础设施\n\nNFT指的是在区块链上采用智能合约记录对应资产权益信息的数字通证。NFT具有不可篡改、记录可追溯等特点，但与比特币、以太坊等同质化代币不同，每一个 NFT 都是独特且唯一的，两两不可互换、不可分割。基于此，NFT得以承载资产确权、稀缺性构建、身份标识、交易流通等功能。\n\nNFT近年来发展迅速，根据BlockBeats数据，截至2022年6月底，NFT总市值\\~230亿美元。其中，根据应用场景和功能的不同，NFT主要包括收藏品、游戏、艺术、功能、虚拟世界等。根据Nonfungible统计，1Q22NFT的交易主要集中在收藏品领域，应用占比超过76%，其次为艺术领域以及游戏领域，均占8%。\n\n当前，NFT市场良莠不齐，头部效应显著。其中，由知名艺术家发行的NFT项目往往能带来较高的热度而得到市场的价值认可，例如，2021年初《Everydays: The First 5000 Days》拍卖价达6935万美元。而市场上质量粗劣的NFT项目往往生命周期短暂，难以持续运营，其价格通常在首次发售后持续下跌。\n\n在交易平台模式方面，NFT交易平台可分为画廊式和开放式。其中，画廊式平台作品上架需要经过平台筛选，门槛较高，主要对接高价值艺术品，以SuperRare为代表；而开放式平台中，任何创作者都可以发布内容，作品种类更多但质量相对更加分化，其代表为OpenSea。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/08d06c03a7464d6e4b0a276d0d628df9.png)![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/d3d28748d646318079be0c295d143208.jpg)\n\n基于NFT的特性，其能够为参与者提供四个维度的价值：\n\n**►资产确权：**基于区块链不可篡改以及NFT非同质化的特性，NFT能够记录资产所有权、历史交易流转信息。对于创作者，其能够在NFT流转的过程中进行版权溯源、防止侵权行为，同时可以在后续交易中持续获得分润，有助于激励其创作积极性。\n\n**►稀缺性构建：**在数字世界中，任何人都可以随意地复制与分享数字内容，并不存在原本和副本的区别，而NFT通过将原生数字内容的所有权记录在链上，进而区分了某一数字内容的真正所有者与副本持有者，从而人为地构建了数字稀缺性。\n\n**►身份标识：**由于NFT的独特性与有限性，持有某一类NFT本身就可以成为一种身份的标识。例如无聊猿游艇俱乐部（BAYC）的NFT头像不仅仅是一件艺术品，还可用作“游艇俱乐部”会员卡，获取对某些以太坊dApp（去中心化应用）及线下BAYC活动的独家访问和参与权。未来，NFT可以标记个人的独有信息，例如履历档案、健康状态等。\n\n**►交易流通：**相对于传统的拍卖与私下洽谈渠道，NFT的二级市场更加透明，参与者可以更便利地交易、转让NFT，并定制收益规则，从而提升了NFT所锚定资产的变现能力。然而，在过度的二级交易也在一定程度上催生了NFT价格泡沫。未来，我们认为NFT二级市场交易方面还需要更多的平台规则保护或监管介入。\n\nDAO：去中心化的组织架构\n\nDAO（Decentralized

Organizations）是一种去中心化的组织形式，通过一套在区块链上执行的共享规则进行协调自治。相较于传统公司制金字塔形的科层式架构，DAO采用更为平等的结构，允许组织中的每个人对他们的利益相关问题进行投票，从而影响决策。\n\nDAO的治理分为链上治理与链下治理两个部分。其中，链上治理是将组织规则代码化，基于参与者所持有的治理代币数量进行投票决策；链下治理则是在区块链之外，组织内部通过社交平台讨论与投票所达成的不具备强制约束性的共同意向。\n\n在发展初期，DAO的链上代币持有量以及相应的投票权集中在项目方，因而其通常以链下治理触达更多潜在用户。伴随项目逐渐成熟、代币持有量的分布趋于分散，DAO会逐渐转向以链上治理为主体，真正实现代码约束下的分权自治。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/04f9ab234846569bcfe4f1e6c8aa0b42.jpg)\n\n**基于其去中心化的架构，DAO存在以下优势**\n\n**►更加透明：**DAO的组织规则、参与者的权利与义务以及奖惩机制等均公开透明且在未获得大部分投票的情况下不可篡改。此外，DAO项目中的每一笔交易、每一次决策均记录在区块链上，能够对历史记录进行追溯。\n\n**►更多共识：**由于DAO是在由参与者共同投票确定的组织规则下运行的，其能够较大限度地降低组织内部的摩擦，更容易凝聚共识和信任。\n\n**►更加开放：**DAO通常在建立在公链上，持有门槛以上的治理代币即可参与治理，没有基于各种身份的准入门槛。因此，与传统的公司制相比，DAO更容易实现全球化扩张。\n\n**内生问题制约元宇宙金融发展，外部监管冲击去中心化原则**\n\n我们认为，元宇宙金融面临来自技术应用、运营治理、经济体系以及监管政策四大层面的风险与挑战，其中：1）技术应用层面的缺陷将导致元宇宙金融内部存在结构性问题；2）运营治理层面的权力过度中心化和低效率或使元宇宙金融丧失竞争力和吸引力；3）市场结构层面的过度投机交易和高杠杆或将引发系统性风险，冲击元宇宙金融的信任和共识；4）各国监管政策差异较大，可能导致元宇宙金融体系发生割裂。\n\n技术应用层面：底层机制带来的约束\n\n**首先，底层共识算法在交易成本方面存在一定问题。**当前，主要的加密货币均采用工作量证明（PoW）的共识算法，耗电量较大且交易成本高。其中，单笔比特币交易耗电\\~2,000千瓦时，而在较为恒定出块速度下（\\~15秒/块），链上交易在市场剧烈波动时会发生拥堵，为了将交易优先被验证，交易发起方也需要支付更高的成本。\n\n**其次，去中心化的底层共识算法也限制了交易吞吐量和可扩展性。**短期内，开发者通过Layer2将主链上的交易计算过程转移到了侧链，从而降低主链的负载和限制，理论吞吐量或可增加至2,000-4,000笔/秒，但Layer2升级也带来了更多安全风险。长期来看，共识机制由工作量证明（PoW）变为权益证明（PoS）以及分片技术的引入，或有望提升吞吐量上限并降低交易耗能，然而PoS或加大激励分配的不平等并导致代币分布的过度中心化。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/4349452dbbb0cefcdda49f4feecb0c46.jpg)\n\n**最后，元宇宙金融有较大的安全风险。**其中，在2021年间，加密经济由于黑客攻击造成的损失就超过10亿美元。为了应对这一风险，投资者可以聘请专业的审计公司和尽调公司来减少潜在漏洞，但这一方式不仅增加了投资成本，也与元宇宙金融减少信用成本的初心相悖。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/2a305a82feaf31bf8204e1804a197b95.jpg)\n\n市场结构层面：高杠杆投机交易带来更高的市场风险\n\n**基于去中心化区块链技术的经济体系难以同时满足安全性和规模化的要求，使得元宇宙金融难以广泛服务于实体经济，导致其主要活动集中于投机领域，并带来更高的市场风险。**\n\n当前，元宇宙金融系统中的杠杆率远高于链下金融体系，加剧了其顺周期性的特征。当加密货币资产价格出现下跌，投资者将经历被动去杠杆的过程，而资产的抛售又将进一步带动加密货币价格大幅下跌，引发恶性循环。\n\n此外，我们认为当前元宇宙金融体系缺乏最后贷款人的角色，使其面对流动性危机时将比中心化的金融体系更加脆弱，而循环抵押以及DeFi资产可相互组合的特点使得DeFi各类底层资产价格存在较高的关联度，进而加剧了市场风险的传导。例如，在LUNA-UST崩盘后，借贷协议Anchor、合成资产mirror以及专门负责赔付的Ozone都遭到了严重的冲击。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/d75fe6702193de184962bd218aca40b2.jpg)\n\n运营治理层面：治理不规范引发的权力集中和混乱低效\n\n在运营治理层面，由于正处于行业优胜劣汰的发展初期，当前元宇宙金融部分项目底层分配机制导致了权利的过度集中与治理的混乱低效，引发了治理权分布和治理效率的问题，使得用户更倾向于将治理代币视为收益工具而非投票工具，且更关心财务回报而非参与治理，更容易为追求短期回报而牺牲项目的长远发展。\n\n在治理权分布上，虽然元宇宙金融的目标是建立去中心化的金融体系，然而在大量项目中，创始团队及早期投资者拥有较高份额的治理代币，使得项目方和投资者对整体决策具有控制权，进而能够单方面基于自身利益修改项目的协议，违背了去中心化的原则。例如Uniswap在应对SEC的审查风险时，其管理团队不经过投票便直接下架了对包括Mirror产品在内的129种代币的交易支持。\n\n在治理效率上，部分投票者对项目的战略发展规划存在信息不对称的问题，阻碍了项目的发展，同时部分参与者仅持有代币以进行投机交易，其所做出的选择并不一定有利于项目的长远发展。此外，投票修改智能合约的流程相对较长，尚处早期的项目或难以灵活改变发展战略。\n\n监管政策层面：受到冲击的去中心化模式\n\n去中心化的元宇宙金融在一定程度上突破了属地监管的概念，跨越了国家、地区间的司法管辖。在去中心化的区块链上，协议、账户与资产都失去了属地概念，进而难以对应现存的监管体系。因此，监管目前重心集中在法币与加密货币兑换环节以及提供兑换功能的相关交易所。\n\n2022年6月，加密货币交易所币安受到美国证券交易委员会进一步的调查。而早在2019年9月，币安受限于监管限制，只能在美国境内推出功能受限、需要完成KYC审核的Binance.US。在监管持续加码的背景下，部分交易所选择积极与监管进行沟通合作，例如Coinbase与美国国税局合作提供用户交易记录，并努力取得各州层面的加密货币牌照。\n\n然而，伴随加密货币交易所走向合规，其实际上也成为了中心化金融体系的一部分，实质上冲击了元宇宙金融去中心化的理念。而拒绝与监管合作的交易所一方面存在较大的监管合规压力，难以稳定拓展业务规模，另一方面由于没有监管机构的审查，交易所内部可能存在内幕交易等问题，而平台上的投资者也难以通过法律等合规渠道保障自身权益。\n\n此外，近年来各主要经济体对于加密货币交易等元宇宙金融活动的监管理念有较大差异，在鼓励科技创新、防范系统风险、维护投资者权益三个维度的光谱上处于不同的位置，而各地区监管政策的差异最终最终或将制约元宇宙金融的发展。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/bf34ece2de5c813aeb2c4a3a1323dd1c.jpg)\n\n**与中心化金融体系交融共进，元宇宙金融或可提供有益借鉴**\n\n**在当前国家主权和社会形态下，完全去中心化的元宇宙金融体系难以广泛存在。我们认为，未来的元宇宙金融可能是构建在中央银行及其他监管机构基础之上、以中心化和非中心化的金融机构为运营主体、更加透明、更加高效、更加普惠的金融体系。**\n\n而在元宇宙金融与传统金融体系交融共进的过程中，我们预计元宇宙金融或将逐步纳入监管框架、搭建合规入口、提升金融系统稳定性，同时其也有望赋能传统金融体系，持续优化传统金融服务效率和体验，推动减少中介代理问题、降低系统运营成本和用户准入门槛。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/cd092422f6c14cb4f7130a22060c4fd1.jpg)\n\n以央行数字货币（CBDC）为例，其一方面是国家主权背书的法币，由各国央行及相关监管机构负责设定运营架构和货币政策，另一方面在运营机制和功能上加入了分布式账本、智能合约等技术，并且一定程度上吸收了去中心化思想，注重保护用户隐私、提升服务可得性。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/65de787d970295214fb28bdce15e9e6c.jpg)\n\n当前，零售型（面向个人）CBDC项目在全球范围内占据主导。其中，中国数字人民币（e-CNY）的交易规模、用户数量位居世界前列。此外，日本、韩国、俄罗斯等国家也开始CBDC试点，而以欧美为代表的发达国家CBDC尚在论证、研发初期。\n\n我们认为，未来CBDC有望成为元宇宙金融支付系统的重要基础设施，并有望通过智能合约、支付即结算等特性应用于各类场景、提升支付系统效率、推动数实结合并赋能实体经济。\n\n**“元宇宙”概念为金融机构数字化转型提供想象空间**\n\n**从现实角度出发，“金融元宇宙”的初心是金融机构数字化转型**\n\n在前一章节，我们描述了“元宇宙金融”体系，同时探讨了“元宇宙金融”面临的技术应用、运营治理、经济体系以及监管政策四大层面的风险与挑战。由于监管环境、技术成熟度等多方面的限制，全球范围内不同国家与地区对于以“加密货币”“DeFi”“NFT”“DAO”等作为代表的“元宇宙金融”拥抱程度不尽相同。因此在本章节中，从实际角度出发，伴随我国金融机构数字化转型的持续加速，我们认为“元宇宙”对于传统金融机构的现实意义更多源自于其底层技术的不断成熟以及其场景不断延伸带来的想象力，有望进一步推动金融机构进行数字化转型、为其数字化转型的路径及最终形态带来更多的可能性。\n\n**“元宇宙”相关概念及底层技术的不断完善能为我国金融机构数字化转型提供更为丰富的可能性及想象空间。**一方面，伴随“元宇宙”逐步向前发展，其底层技术例如建模渲染、交互技术、物联网、网络算力、区块链、人工智能等技术的应用有望加速落地，我们认为金融机构将受益于相关技术的快速发展、更好地实现业务创新、流程改造、组织变革等数字化转型目标；另一方面，“元宇宙”为我们勾勒出一幅具有数字原生能力、甚至具有完备经济与社交体系的虚拟世界图景，我们认为“元宇宙”带来的沉浸式体验感以及虚拟元素的真实感将为金融机构线上协作、线上展业以及客户体验升级等方面提供更丰富的想象空间。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/4f33b4d71fa33ec893bb22970c14d05b.png)\n\n**海外“元宇宙金融”与“金融元宇宙”均有发展，国内聚焦数字化转型**\n\n观海外：金融机构“元宇宙”创新呈现三个层级\n\n海外金融机构积极探索元宇宙，可以按照“业务渠道是否拓展至元宇宙平台/业务创新是否有关去中心化金融”两个判断因素所构成的决策树分为下图中三个层级。由于监管环境、金融体系、“元宇宙”场景成熟度等多方面的差异，我们认为海外金融机构在层级3的探索对我国金融机构进行初期“元宇宙”探索更具备借鉴意义。\n\n**►层级1：探索、布局元宇宙中的去中心化金融业务。**举例来讲，摩根大通的Onyx项目负责人于2022年6月表示计划通过将美国国债或货币市场基金份额代币化，使其可能成为DeFi池中的抵押品等方式开展机构级的DeFi业务，摩根大通目前已参与新加坡金融管理局Project Guardian的项目试点，并进行相关探索工作\\[1]）、韩国国民银行正在探索的融合性数字钱包（可存放多种代币、NFT、央行货币的多币钱包已完成测试等\\[2]）等均属于传统金融机构融合去中心化思想为元宇宙发展提供的金融活动。\n\n**►层级2：将元宇宙平台作为现有金融业务的新渠道。**在这种发展方向下，金融机构基于已经存在的“元宇宙”相关场景并利用该类场景提升其自身客户的服务体验，例如汇丰银行在Sandbox中开设虚拟运动场，为新老客户创造新颖的品牌体验\\[3]；富达投资与 Fidelity Metaverse ETF共同推出位于Decentraland中的“Fidelity Stack”进行投资基础知识教育\\[4]；摩根大通在Decentraland中上线Onyx休息室，展示其区块链业务发展历程等\\[5]。\n\n**►层级3：采用元宇宙相关技术促进数字化转型。**金融机构利用XR、数字孪生、3D建模、人工智能等元宇宙相关技术进一步推动数字化转型，其技术的成熟与场景的延伸伴随“元宇宙”的创新同步发展。例如，如新西兰ASB银行发布虚拟员工Josie；法国巴黎银行于2017年在零售银行、房地产以及保险业务上均应用VR技术辅助业务开展，并于2022年进一步迭代数字孪生房地产项目WIRED，为客户提供欧洲范围内社区的历史重现与未来预测，辅助客户决策；富达投资在探索VR将如何促进服务创新上步履不停；花旗银行在2016年发布借助微软全息透镜推出的全息虚拟金融交易工作台的概念验证；万事达卡在2020年推出AR App，帮助用户了解其权益；美国银行利用VR技术进行员工培训；韩国国民银行在元宇宙平台Gather上开辟员工办公区；韩国韩华人寿推出元宇宙虚拟培训平台“Lifeplus Town”等。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/c362f02c0b0d0b514d46681649cca855.png)![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/3d4da884846bb7868f2ebad485973ac1.jpg)\n\n观国内：“元宇宙金融”发展受限；“金融元宇宙”实现初步探索\n\n**我国监管部门对金融机构进行元宇宙相关探索发展持审慎态度，防范金融不确定性。**由于元宇宙的发展带来了信息保护、资产保护等方面的问题，例如投资者可能受到黑客攻击造成的私钥泄露、财产损失，以及加密货币资产价格不稳定，DeFi的高杠杆特性进一步放大市场风险等伤害。故涉及“元宇宙金融”（即以加密货币、DeFi、NFT、DAO等为代表）的活动在我国发展空间受限，部分政策对融资/交易/挖矿等活动、对原生币/同质化代币的性质、对NFT产品、以及对元宇宙相关技术应用的规范作出了明确的规定，主要目的为应对风险，保护投资者个人财产与信息安全，防范金融不确定性。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/650ee968dd3c2a51307314fe24f368fc.jpg)\n\n**在监管的审慎态度下，借助“元宇宙”相关概念和技术加码数字化转型是目前我国金融机构进行“元宇宙”初步探索的主要创新方向。**除已经实现深度应用的“ABCDI”技术之外，金融机构借助“元宇宙”概念在虚拟人、数字孪生、XR为代表的交互和建模技术层面实现了一定突破。此外，我们认为NFT的出现亦有望帮助金融机构在区块链赋能供应链金融的应用中更进一步。\n\n**►虚拟人：**虚拟人集成NLP、智能语音、计算机视觉、专业知识图谱等人工智能技术构建交互能力和专业性，并以人像建模、动作捕捉等交互、建模渲染技术塑造外形\\[6]，在线上线下渠道的客户服务中保持友善的服务态度，智能的引导水平，同时可以协助业务办理，帮助企业建立新潮的品牌形象。虚拟人与数据中台连接，采集到的前端业务数据可以助力金融机构分析各网点的高频问题与业务需求，进一步提升运营能力。虽然早在2019年，南京银行、光大银行、浦发银行即推出虚拟人数字员工，但国内虚拟人应用的案例/计划却在2021年下半年集中出现。\n\n**►数字孪生：**数字孪生技术能够助力金融机构提升运营能力与创新能力。在智能运营领域，数字孪生能够提供数据中心可视化、IT架构可视化管理、数字化智慧园区、数字化运营、企业架构资产管理、金融业科技信息报送系统、金融一体化运维以及金融安保可视化等服务\\[7]。而在2021至2022年间，利用数字孪生技术助力乡村振兴、银企对接、银行生态建设的计划已经出现，助力信贷产品创新的案例，随着技术进一步发展和应用，我们认为数字孪生对业务创新的推动力未来可期。\n\n**►XR：**XR为扩展现实技术，包括VR/AR/MR/全息影像\\[8]，能够为金融机构建设体验感、沉浸感和趣味性更强的线上渠道。其中，AR技术应用较早，集中于信用卡推广、丰富线上APP体验、数据汇总与展示、重大节日营销上；VR技术的应用可按照无需VR头显/需要VR头显获得服务区分，无需VR设备，在手机等移动设备上的VR展示提供如会场、会客厅等3D空间，并在此集成多种线上渠道的服务与营销手段，而利用头显的服务主要出现在银行的智慧网点沉浸式体验中。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/5decbb71484c37f17de9de918709c0a4.png)![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/c98f104b77805c0e6e1b1462cb330b36.jpg)![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/6227c8c85b9866ec344c87af6ff8d569.jpg)![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0719/f28c60a3078b5304809c8a11c205bb5e.jpg)\n\n**“元宇宙”相关概念及技术能为金融机构数字化转型带来什么价值？**\n\n2021年为央行印发的《金融科技（Fintech）发展规划（2019-2021年）》的收官之年，从传统金融机构的“数字化转型”答卷来看，其技术发展路径主要聚焦5G+“ABCD”，同时部分领先机构已逐步开始挖掘细分技术领域的创新应用。往前看，我们认为传统金融机构数字化转型主要呈现三大趋势：1）提质、增效、降损；2）打造数字化转型支撑底座；3）科技向善。（详见中金非银组已发布报告《[见微知著：金融机构数字化转型——初心如磐，稳中求进](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?\\__biz=Mzg5MzYwMTU2OQ==\\&mid=2247486343\\&idx=1\\&sn=aa4697dd583b0e2b0e63187f43704fdf\\&chksm=c02d19c9f75a90dfc2d16023f2ce53fb6342b4264f8ccea87c8598d13e945940cdeeacdce2a1\\&scene=21#wechat_redirect)》）\n\n我们认为，在我国传统金融机构数字化转型加速的背景下，“元宇宙”相关概念及技术的发展有望在人力资源、数字营销以及运营等方面为传统金融机构带来新的数字化转型方向、同时为其用户带来更丰富的数字化体验。\n\n**人力资源层面，有望实现员工工作体验与培训效率的提升：**1）提升线上工作的氛围感：韩国国民银行在元宇宙平台Gather上线的KB金融城提供在二维平面上展示的虚拟办公空间，使得员工虽然身处各地，但仍能够感到线下办公的氛围与面对面交流的体验；2）提升员工工作效率：虚拟数字员工采用AI这一元宇宙底层技术之一，解放员工生产力，例如水滴公司的数字员工均能利用RPA与AI技术，帮助员工处理日常性事务。3）提升培训的趣味性与知识留存：美国银行于2021年建设VR培训点，员工可以通过VR头戴式设备模拟不同情境下与客户交流的方式，其内嵌的实时分析技术可为主管分析培训结果，方便后续的个性化指导。根据美国银行，在其试点的400名员工中，90%认为VR培训是一个有趣的体验，97%认为在VR培训后能够在工作中更自信，并认为能有效提升知识留存\\[9]。\n\n**营销层面，有助于金融机构服务能力与用户体验的提升。**\n\n**►提升服务能力：**一方面，金融机构利用元宇宙相关技术可以帮助其在数据呈现与展示方式、线上用户交互方式、通过虚拟人员工提供7\\*24小时服务等方面在服务方式与服务质量上得到进一步提升；另一方面，传统机构也可以运用“元宇宙”相关的交互、建模渲染等技术，在服务时实现更加丰富且具有真实感的图像与网页以及在服务式增设如VR/AR等设备，有效提升服务质量。\n\n**►提升用户体验：**1）以新潮的UI界面设计吸引年轻用户：目前，年轻用户表现出利用线上渠道获取金融服务的偏好，金融元宇宙有望采用虚拟人/XR等交互、建模、渲染技术构建新潮的UI界面吸引年轻用户的兴趣。艾瑞咨询调查结果显示，中国的银行用户越年轻，去线下网点的频率越低\\[10]，而韩国NH Investment & Securities在阐述其NH Universe的元宇宙计划时也表示，MZ一代（千禧一代+Z世代）占经纪公司移动交易服务的52%，故期望用多样化的数字平台使其投资活动变得简单有趣\\[11]；2）降低用户综合成本：金融机构利用虚拟人进行线上线下智能引导、VR/AR技术丰富抽象数据的展示形式，用户所付出的等待、理解交付成果等时间成本有望进一步降低；3）提升交互体验与服务可获得性：目前，金融机构体现了对虚拟人“人设”的关注度，致力于将数字员工打造为性格友善的服务者，或能在线上线下交互时为用户营造轻松、愉悦的氛围。同时，元宇宙技术还能够使用户于线上渠道上获得“类线下”的体验，便利性得到了提升，如保险沉浸式线上VR平台致力于还原线下投保流程，但用户可以足不出户即可在移动设备上取得相关服务。\n\n**运营层面，有助于提升监控能力、分析能力以及信息保护能力。**在“元宇宙”相关的技术中，例如数字孪生技术可以帮助金融机构利用图表和3D模型实时监控资源分布与使用情况，并突破传统台账、资产效率管理系统效率较低，缺乏实时直观展示能力的缺点；直观理解公司日益繁复的IT架构和企业架构，提升理解与分析运营流程的能力，提升规范化管理、跨部门团队协作；同时能够通过电力、管线、供配电、照明、电梯、安防系统等基础设施的数字孪生，做到在能够实时监控数据中心等建筑的运行情况，迅速定位异常，提升保护信息安全、员工人身安全和财产安全的能力。\n\n\\[1]https\\://www\\.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/11/jpmorgan-wants-to-bring-trillions-of-dollars-of-tokenized-assets-to-defi/\n\n\\[2]https\\://www\\.ccvalue.cn/article/1389557.html\n\n\\[3]https\\://www\\.ledgerinsights.com/hsbc-buys-nft-land-in-sandbox-metaverse-game/\n\n\\[4]https\\://www\\.businesswire.com/news/home/20220421005259/en/FIDELITY-OPENS-%E2%80%9CTHE-FIDELITY-STACK%E2%80%9D-IN-DECENTRALAND-BECOMES-FIRST-BROKERAGE-FIRM-WITH-IMMERSIVE-EDUCATIONAL-METAVERSE-EXPERIENCE\n\n\\[5]https\\://www\\.youtube.com/watch?v=54zs_mbUa1I\n\n\\[6]《2022虚拟人产业研究报告》：速途元宇宙研究院，2022年6月6日\n\n\\[7]https\\://www\\.uino.com/solution/finance/\n\n\\[8]Lee,

In the spirit of building in the open with the community, we have prioritized getting community feedback quickly with this initial release.\n\nIf you’d like to be an early tester, sign up at [signup.scroll.io](https://signup.scroll.io) for access.  We will invite as many testers as possible while we drive towards a permissionless, public release.\n\n## **What’s in the pre-alpha testnet?**\n\nThis initial release will be run on a private PoA fork of Ethereum (the testnet L1) operated by Scroll. On top of this private chain, we will run a testnet Scroll L2 supporting the following features:\n\n* Users will be able to play with a few key demo applications such as a Uniswap fork with familiar web interfaces such as Metamask.\n* Users will be able to view the state of the Scroll testnet via block explorers.\n* Scroll will run a node that supports unlimited read operations (e.g. getting the state of accounts) and user-initiated transactions involving interactions with the pre-deployed demo applications (e.g. transfers of ERC-20 tokens or swaps of tokens).\n* Rollers will generate and aggregate validity proofs for part of the zkEVM circuits to ensure a stable release. In the next testnet phase, we will ramp up this set of zkEVM circuits.\n* Bridging assets between these testnet L1 and L2s will be enabled through a smart contract bridge, though arbitrary message passing will not be supported in this release.\n\nScroll’s pre-alpha testnet will be the first chance for early users and developers to interact with our infrastructure and experience dapp workflows on Scroll. As we scale our node infrastructure, we will relax some of the performance-motivated restrictions and onboard more testers.\n\n## **What’s next for Scroll?**\n\nSoon after our pre-alpha testnet, we will be deploying a more open and permissionless alpha testnet. This will be deployed on a public Ethereum testnet and will be open to the public. In particular, our community can expect the following features:\n\n* Allowing developers to deploy smart contracts\n* Allowing anyone to run an archival Scroll node\n* Generating and aggregating more pieces of the zkEVM proof to be verified on-chain\n\nAs we move step by step towards an eventual mainnet release, we will enable successively more pieces of our final architecture, including a decentralized Roller network and integrations with EVM-native developer tools. In the next few weeks, we will release a series of expository articles and posts explaining Scroll’s architecture and the technical vision that has informed Scroll’s development decisions.  Stay tuned to learn more about these!\n\n## Scroll’s Release Philosophy\n\nScroll’s plan for scaling Ethereum and serving billions of users and developers is a long-term roadmap that requires careful consideration and execution. We firmly believe in the future of the zkEVM as a key to scaling Ethereum, and as such, are committed to releasing it in a way that allows us to work through any challenges in a focused manner and incorporate feedback alongside our roadmap.\n\nBy giving users, developers and the broader community progressively more functionality to test instead of releasing all features at once, we aim to isolate any bugs and UX difficulties early and often, allowing us to build towards the most robust, scalable solution that will stand the test of time.\n\n## 📜Join us and learn more\n\nTo become an early tester or contributor, sign up to try out our pre-alpha testnet at [signup.scroll.io](https://signup.scroll.io). In the meantime, if our vision of scaling Ethereum in an open and community-driven way resonates with you, we are looking for values-aligned individuals to help Scroll become the most developer- and user-friendly scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\n* If you are a ZK researcher, ZKP, Go or Solidity developer, or a GPU engineer, we are working on many interesting technical challenges at the edge of what’s possible. Come build cutting-edge solutions to these problems with us in the open!\n* If you love nurturing and growing ecosystems or communities, we are looking for developer advocates and community organizers to make sure we are building in a community-aligned and user-friendly way.\n\nTo learn more about these roles and about Scroll, check out our [website](https://scroll.io/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP), [Discord](https://discord.gg/CNzNVt4Feu), or [jobs page](https://jobs.lever.co/ScrollFoundation).

Wilson and Josh Olszewicz are joined by Alyse Killeen, founder and managing partner of Stillmark.\n\nWilson begins by asking, “Having some focus or a lot of focus on Bitcoin makes your experience as a venture capitalist totally fascinating to me. Where does it all start?”\n\nKilleen responds, “I started in venture capital about a decade ago and always focused primarily on infrastructure technologies. As I was doing that, I discovered Bitcoin and specifically recognized an opportunity for a financial technology that well served poor people and the world's very large unbanked and underbanked population. To me, that was so compelling.”\n\nShifting the conversation toward Stillmark, Olszewicz says, “You’ve really focused, at least based on your portfolio list, recently, on Lightning. Was that a decision early on as it was developing, and beyond Lightning now, what do you see in the future?”\n\nIn response, Killeen delves into structure, “We're investing in two buckets, and the first bucket is the financialization of bitcoin, the asset … Bucket number two is companies that are doing these “moonshot projects” built on Lightning … Where the market has been, and thus where our focus has been is in infrastructure-related companies, so sometimes this can feel a little less personal or a little less flashy or relatable. However, the pieces of infrastructure that are really going to affect the day-to-day experiences of people using Lightning are being built now.”\n\nShe goes on to say, “Instead of being a bitcoin fund, we are actually a generalist fund, within the Bitcoin space, so we are doing top to bottom — all of it that is happening in Bitcoin right now.”\n\nWilson asks, “How would you say that confidence in the founders changes from traditional VC to bitcoin ventures?”\n\nKilleen responds, “That was the opportunity for Stillmark. It was to not be adherent to the old school VC mindset, but to apply the tools and the framework of traditional ventures which work really incredibly well to bolster founders and to apply that to a new paradigm.”\n\nContinuing on the venture capitalist line, Killeen explains, “We think about venture capital as just being resources to help founders accelerate where they are going. So we are normally backing folks that are going to get there anyway, and then hopefully with us, through capital and sometimes with network introductions and support from prior lessons learned from working with hundreds of companies, founders can build quicker. Now, from a Bitcoin perspective, there is one other nuance … If we do good work, I hope that that means that adoption is catalyzed, and also the utility set that is offered in Bitcoin expands. So my hope is if we do good work, the fundamental value of bitcoin can be increased.”\n\nListen to the full episode for more!", "timestamp": 1658208653, "digest": "kT9kzvHR_R5wSxG-wBT4opy3mY9tpKtjfJDjexEUV60", "contributor": "0x6c544253B939bDE5bA92f8727d4DEC910b5253ba"}

Although he couldn't keep up with Cao Xueqin's thoughts in many aspects, he at least let Daiyu die. No matter whether she ascended to immortal or passed away, at least she said goodbye to Baoyu. It was very good.\n\nIt's not that I'm inherently cruel and like to watch other people's tragedies, but isn't there a saying? Sai Weng lost his horse, is it not a blessing? For a fragile feudal girl like Daiyu, death is her release, the end of all her tragedies, and her happiness. When she was sleeping quietly in the ground, watching Baoyu still looking for a way out in the mortal world, she had to say that she was still happy.\n\nMaybe two people are romantic people, romantic people should not meet by nature, because life is not romantic, life will kill romance completely, in the end, red roses become mosquito blood on the wall, white roses become White rice sticking to the chest. Therefore, let the romance come to an end at the most beautiful time, and leave happy memories in each other's hearts.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Ba9yxm9p8Knwz4Y2GcOx.png?height=270&width=397)\n\nBut maybe you will say that Daiyu's death was tragic and not romantic at all. On this point, I don't agree with Gao E's sequel. Maybe Cao Xueqin's original intention is not this, maybe Daiyu should really testify with tears. , isn't that better? She cared about Baoyu, and cried bitterly for this confidant with all her enthusiasm, with deep thoughts, such a death, is it not noble and sacred, but Gao E did not write it like this, he finally let Daiyu refer to the sky very vulgarly Anger, anger and death. This is not like the arrogant and self-appreciating Daiyu we know, but like an ordinary woman who is frustrated in love.\n\nEven so, she finally left the place of right and wrong before Jia's house collapsed, otherwise, with her fragility, I'm afraid she wouldn't be able to endure such a big stimulus. Baoyu is a playboy, he is not a man of the sky, he can actually give Daiyu very little, not to mention protection and comfort, he is still a weak person who needs the protection of others, so by his side, Daiyu can't get it. happy.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pENtaJlqDFBcEndw-s78J.png?height=270&width=397)\n\nSo it is a blessing to be able to leave him with memories. Baoyu himself can only give Daiyu a few good words. He can't even talk about infatuation. Looking at Baochai's end, he has to say that Daiyu is happy. Of course, some people say that what Baochai needs is only the throne of Baoer's grandmother. She didn't care about Baoyu, did she? Is there a woman who likes loneliness by nature? Anyway, it is always miserable to be alone in a lonely house. What's more, it is still a question whether she has sat on the throne of the so-called Grandma Bao'er.\n\nIf the Jia family does not fall, at least Baochai will have a place to live, at least he will still be rich without her husband, but isn't that the case? In the end, Jia's house was reduced to the point where the white land was really clean. What meaning does the title of Bao Er's grandmother have to Baochai? Without a happy life, without the care of a husband, to live and die alone in loneliness, isn't it a bigger tragedy?\n\nI have always suspected that Baoyu did not leave the Jia residence because of Daiyu, otherwise he would not marry Baochai. He was finally born because his world had undergone earth-shattering changes. His ivory tower collapsed. He finally understood his struggle. Now, everything is over for him, all his thoughts and struggles are gone, and he has to run away from home, perhaps to avoid disaster.\n\nJust imagine, can you imagine the scene where Daiyu washes her hands and cooks to make soup? Wearing a tattered dress and even relying on the help of others, then of course she can no longer be mean and gossip, she can only cry alone, not about love, but life. When life puts a huge question mark on Baodai's love, can Daiyu love Baoyu as always? I don't think so, I'm afraid the flood will flood the Dragon King Temple. Then Baoyu finally couldn't stand the pressure of the family and walked away. It's very possible that he didn't take good care of Baochai and couldn't afford to live. The same is true for Daiyu.\n\nAnother possibility is that if Jia’s house can be regrouped, Lan Gui, Qifang, Daiyu and Baoyu are still living their happy lives. Years later, Baoyu may suddenly find that Daiyu is wrinkled, and then he will find the attacking people around him. It was just like Concubine Zhao of that year, and then love passed by in time, and then Baoyu would recall that beautiful sister Bao.\n\nIn fact, love is very short-lived. At least this cut-off love has given us many beautiful fantasies and expectations. Just like Jack is to Rose, he is the most beautiful memory in her life, but it is not the only one.", "timestamp": 1658208484, "digest": "n06aMHuZQ_YF5tgwkzBmuyY8lFaxgxV5VPhWSVPBc1U", "contributor": "0x72c836ED9809B8b8540C7dbdC0036D321BCA85C3"}

{"id": "dUWA_CLD-Kokb8p4u440d87QkMPkM5gJQWEFt_IONnI", "title": "How The Government Seizes Assets And Why Bitcoin Is A Problem For Statists", "body": "*This is an opinion editorial by Rowdy Yates, a former Marine and practicing lawyer.*\n\nWhen most people hear the words “frozen bank account” or “asset forfeiture,” they likely picture a sophisticated government black box worthy of a Hollywood montage, with some mysterious synth music overlaid. The truth is far less glamorous but no less troubling. A sober examination of the government’s tools for seizing and forfeiting property helps to illuminate a key attribute of bitcoin’s value. In this piece, I dissect how the government legally seizes property and why bitcoin is the asset class best positioned to resist this seizure.\n\nFirst, we should discuss some basic terminology before we discuss this legal process in low resolution. A “target” is a term to refer to a person or business being investigated that is typically not yet charged with a crime. “Asset seizure” means the government takes one’s property and puts that property in government custody; think of this as temporary incarceration of property. “Freezing” means that the government denies you the ability to sell, move or transfer your property, but it does not necessarily take custody of the property; think of this as house arrest for your property. Finally, “forfeiture” (a topic for another day) means the government obtains a legal right to the property. After a forfeiture, the government can lawfully transfer, sell or destroy that property; think of this as final and permanent confiscation of property. In other words, your property rights went to the electric chair. Notably, forfeiture begins with a seizure.\n\nWith that lexicon in place, we can think of government confiscation as a three-step process. Law enforcement agents often receive a tip about a target committing a crime. If that crime is lucrative, the agents try to determine what assets the target controls: money in a bank account, Lambos, real estate etc. This is step one. If the agents can find evidence that the assets are tied to a crime, the agents can ask a judge for permission to seize those assets — step two. Once agents have their permission from the judge, they can start interfering with the target’s property rights, which is step three.\n\nWith that overview in place, let’s walk through the stages of seizure and examine each stage through the lens of third-party custody, self-custody and the bitcoin ledger, specifically.\n\n## Step One: Identifying Assets\n\nIn a third-party custody world, many institutions are obliged by the Banking Secrecy Act to proactively give the government information about you and your assets — *sua sponte*. For example, if you conduct any kind of financial transaction in the third-party custody world that exceeds $10,000, the institution you use creates a currency transaction report (CTR) and any unusual activity in your accounts is documented by a suspicious activity report (SAR). These reports are delivered to law enforcement at regular intervals; no work is required by law enforcement to obtain this invasive information. If the agents want more in-depth information — no problem. They run to a government attorney, who prints out a subpoena in less than five minutes (no judge will likely ever see this, let alone sign it). The agent then runs that subpoena to a fractional reserve banker or other representative and presto: That custodial company provides any invasive data the agent wants.\n\nIn a self-custody world, you are not obliged to report to law enforcement when, for example, you move gold from your backyard to your underground lair. The government needs to find this information on their own. Certain assets are easier to find, e.g., cars registered in your name, but for the most part, agents will need to conduct physical surveillance to identify your assets. This may not be hard for agents, but it’s not easy (contrast with the paragraph above). The agents also lose their cheap trick of using subpoenas in the self-custody world. Imagine for a second how useless it would be for a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ agent to serve a subpoena on a gangbanger keeping a stack of $100 bills. Keep in mind, agents actually have limited resources and they are more likely to seize assets that are easy to find than ones that are hidden.\n\nIn a Bitcoin ledger world, the ledger is public but pseudonymous. Bitcoin does not deliver reports to law enforcement, although data analytics firms do. Analytics may be able to identify which UTXOs belong to you, but if you take precautions the identification process will be laborious, costly and confusing for agents. To move forward with the legal process, agents have to convince a judge that a particular UTXO is under your custody and control. This process will require competence across several dimensions of knowledge and a significant aggregation of data. Newsflash: Law enforcement agents are just people; they fall asleep in school, fail chemistry and get bad grades — just like us. In the Bitcoin ledger world, identification is hard. For a deeper exploration on the expertise and difficulty involved, read Namcios’ [article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-authorities-found-bitfinex-bitcoin) describing the multi-year saga of law enforcement’s attempts to seize bitcoin from the 2016 Bitfinex hack.\n\n## Step Two: Boring Paperwork\n\nIn the United States, the government has a limited toolbox to legally1 interfere with your personal property in this manner. Whether it is the FBI, Homeland Security or another federal agency, the process is conceptually the same. Government agents work with government attorneys to draft some paperwork for a judge to review and sign. Agents must accomplish three critical tasks with their writing:\n\n1.  Identify the assets they want to seize.\n2.  Describe where the assets are.\n3.  Most importantly, they need to tell the judge why these assets are bad (typically this means telling the judge the assets are used to commit a crime or they are proceeds from a crime).2\n\nIf the judge thinks the agent is wrong (this is quite rare), then the judge kicks the paperwork back to the agent and perhaps gives the agent an opportunity to revise the paperwork. If the judge agrees with the agent (this happens 99% of the time), the judge signs an order or a warrant. This signed order or warrant is nothing more than a piece of paper that says the agent is legally authorized to seize (take custody of) or freeze the property.\n\n## Step Three: Taking Property\n\nStep three involves two parts for our agent:\n\n1.  Service: The agent has to hand over the paperwork signed by the judge to whoever has custody of the assets.\n2.  Transfer assets: Logistically moving the assets to government custody or otherwise denying the target access.\n\nAs we explore below, each step can range from simple to impossible depending on the nature of the asset and the manner of its custody.\n\nIn a third-party custody world, the agent’s job is trivial when the property is the custody of a “law-abiding” custodian — like a fractional reserve banker or financial services firms (e.g., Edward Jones or Charles Schwab). The agent just hands over the paperwork to the representative. Often, the agent can submit the paperwork via internet portals and never even leave the comfort of their air-conditioned office. The bank or financial services firm will then transfer money to a government account or lock the target out of the account (this was the very basic maneuver executed by Trudeau against his subjects during the trucker protest). The custodian does not care about your property rights, and they are perfectly willing to crush them. \n\nIn a self-custody world, the agent’s job is more difficult. There is no custodian listed in the White Pages to make serving the paperwork easy and the logistical task of moving assets can be more complex yet. With conspicuous assets, agents may be able to easily locate the property, but larger and bulkier items require more logistics to seize (think about planes belonging to the cartel; the agent has to rent a hangar). With inconspicuous property, the task difficulty is increased dramatically. Imagine an agent trying to seize a clandestine stockpile of gold from some sharp-shooting gun nuts. The agent has to try and find hidden property in meat space by either conducting physical surveillance, developing a snitch network or hoping the gun nuts send a treasure map over Facebook. Self-custody presents problems in meat space because the custodian (you) does care about property rights.\n\nIn a Bitcoin ledger world, there are manifold problems for our agent. First, there is no address (physical, email or otherwise) to find a Bitcoin representative that our agent can serve with his signed official paperwork. There is no clerk, CEO or representative — period — let alone one that can effectuate the network transfer of your satoshis to a public address controlled by the government. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin is a huge problem for our agent. Importantly, this advantage goes out the window if you don’t self-custody your bitcoin. Second, with properly stored seed phrases, our agent needs to physically locate the phrases or coerce you or negotiate with you to give up the phrases. This task becomes more daunting with multisig.\n\n## Bitcoin Is Peace Of Mind\n\nWhen planning for asset protection it is important to remember the old story about you and a friend encountering a grizzly bear in the forest. You don’t have to outrun the grizzly; you just have to outrun your friend. When the government wants to seize cryptocurrency, they will go after Vitalik Buterin or another CEO to whom they can serve legal documents. When the government wants to seize bitcoin, they will go after yield-seekers and assets in third-party custody. That’s because it is always easier for the government to deal with centralized organizations and assets, whether for taxation purposes, social-credit-score purposes or for seizure purposes. You should always be a hard target for bad actors and your wealth should be no different.\n\nStay sovereign, my friends.\n\n#### Endnotes\n\n1\\. I specify “legally” here because the government can always exceed these bounds and interfere with property illegally, but this is risky for the government.\n\n2\\. In case you’re wondering, items that are illegal per se are not subject to this process. The legislature has deemed cocaine, LSD, meth, etc. to be contraband. So a police officer can just take these items without going through this process.\n\n*This is a guest post by Rowdy Yates.

{"id": "qgC3hvAnKodVqBqvARcGx93_XULiLrMnHOxyh3yPtD8", "title": "Little Doudou by the Window", "body": "Today, I finished reading \"Little Doudou by the Window\". I think the protagonist of the book, Xiaodoudou, is very lively and lovely, and her understanding character is very endearing.\n\nThis book mainly recounts what happened when the author was a child.\n\nAfter reading this book, I felt that Xiaodoudou is a cheerful child who likes to play with his peers. Not only that, Xiaodoudou is a child who doesn't laugh at others. In the \"Ba Gakuen\" that Xiaodoudou read on the first day, I met many new friends, the only boy Yamamoto Taiming, he was suffering from polio. So walking is inconvenient. Once Xiaodoudou brought Taiming to her own tree, and wanted Taiming to see things further away, Xiaodoudou first went to the janitor's uncle's tool room and dragged a ladder, and quickly climbed up The tree, and then let Taiming climb up. With Taiming's own efforts and the help of Xiaodoudou, he finally climbed up the tree and looked at the world with Xiaodoudou. It can be seen from this incident that Xiaodoudou not only did not laugh at a boy of the same age who was suffering from polio, but was also willing to help him and liked to play with Taiming.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/x1Mj33-8ZgZEPqGjMaQGL.png?height=270&width=417)\n\nXiaodoudou's character of not laughing at others not only makes me admire, but also a role model for us to learn from.\n\nOn the contrary, some people, just because their family is rich, often buy some famous brand clothes and wear them back to school to show off how beautiful their clothes are, and when they see a classmate who is not dressed better than them, they will laugh at that classmate, once , I heard from my mother that the daughter of a friend of hers was paralyzed from the waist down because of a traffic accident. She was very sad at that time. After a period of time, she returned to the school to take classes. As soon as she entered the classroom, she heard some classmates sneering at her, laughing that she could not walk and was a useless person. At that time, she, who had just calmed down, was discriminated and ridiculed by her classmates again, and her mood fluctuated again. After hearing about this, I felt very sympathetic to the girl, and at the same time felt very angry, I really wanted to teach her classmates a lesson. If the girl's classmates can understand her, care and encourage her a little more, and help her a little more, just like Xiaodoudou. That would not make the girl feel inferior.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LKX-ZfQyKzX0yAptIFvFs.png?height=270&width=418)\n\nThe book tells that Xiaodoudou was expelled from the original school for being naughty, but Ba Xueyuan opened the door for her, not only accepted her happily, but also gave her and her companions enough happiness. Xiaodoudou, who lives in \"Ba Xueyuan\", seems to live in a fairy tale world. He has learned the knowledge from books, learned to care about others, learned tolerance and sincerity, and let Xiaodoudou grow into a person with rich emotions, kind-hearted and simple. Happy child. It seems that the cultivation of good character is far more important than the learning of knowledge. This is really a school that parents and children dream of. I suddenly think of our current education system that blindly pursues children's scores. Many schools, on the surface, call for quality education, but in fact, they are still \"exam-oriented education\". Regarding the problem of load reduction, despite the repeated orders from the Education Bureau, in most schools, the workload of students has not been reduced at all. Many children travel to and from various training institutions on weekends. Going to other peers and going to the training class is not necessarily good. Parents are more entangled. Of course, the school and teachers cannot be blamed for these situations, but the consequences of exam-oriented education. I really envy the teaching method of Baxueyuan.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VXIaVe49Tnl-OM3f1-GVK.png?height=270&width=387)\n\n\"Little Doudou by the Window\" taught me how to be a mother. Adzuki Doudou can grow up healthily and happily. She can't do without her mother who has always understood her psychology. After Xiaodoudou was expelled from school, when she transferred to Ba Xueyuan, her mother just said that she would change schools, she was afraid that she would leave her child with an inferiority complex. If it were me, I would definitely say: \"What's the matter? You're only in first grade, but you were expelled from school! If you are not obedient, no school will want you, and when you grow up, you can only sweep garbage\" These words, this article It reminded me of another classic story that has been very popular recently. Every time my mother went to a parent-teacher conference for her restless son, she would always be severely criticized by the teacher, judging that her son would not become a talent. But every time she lied to her son, how the teacher praised him, and her son finally succeeded in her white lie! My children have never been very confident, I really should learn more from these two mothers. Let children learn with confidence.\n\nWe are powerless to change some institutional environments, but what we can do for our children is to truly understand them, to love them in the way they need, to guide them, and to create an environment for them to form various good qualities.", "timestamp": 1658208735, "digest": "3ziN0v1HQQUfWnkHh4ZQypo3ZvPisqZNBjVaPRf8pi0", "contributor": "0x72c836ED9809B8b8540C7dbdC0036D321BCA85C3"}

While some opt to share experiences with specific men in private online forums hoping to carve out a safe space for women online, others are going public by sharing their stories on TikTok. Some of these efforts are fueled by the political environment, including the[ stark new reality women face](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/politics/roe-v-wade-supreme-court-what-matters/index.html) after the reversal of Roe v.

Earlier this year, [#WestElmCaleb](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/29/health/west-elm-caleb-dating-wellness/index.html) made clear the power of women sharing information about a bad date on TikTok. The hashtag originated after one woman posted about a 20-something employee of the retailer who'd apparently exhibited poor dating behavior, such as ghosting, which led to allegations that he had been lying to numerous women in New York City. It [inspired a conversation](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/caleb-from-west-elm-meme) about whether he was deserving of such attention, both on TikTok and the resulting news cycle.

He originates from the highest point, and ice and snow are his predecessors. He gathered many trickles to form a powerful flood, rushing down, he zigzagged through the cliffs, washed down a layer of sandy soil, carried the rolling sand and stones, and flowed away happily and bravely, Along the way he enjoys everything he encounters:\nSometimes when he encounters the obstacles in front of the rock, he rushes angrily, roaring, whirling, and the ups and downs of the waves before and after push him, until he crosses and overthrows the cliff, he is calm and swept away.

He has come to the end of his journey, this sea, that holds his breath, makes him bow, how vast and great she is! How bright and how dark! The sea solemnly stretched out his arms to receive him, and he flowed into her arms silently. He has melted, naturalized, neither happy nor sad!\nMaybe one day, he will rise from the fluffy raindrops on the sea again, fly westward, form a river again, wash down the stone walls on both sides, and then look for the peach blossoms on the shore.

He gathered a lot of vitality from the ground, stretched out under the snow and ice, and bravely and happily broke out of the shell in the moist soil in early spring. He may grow on the plains, on the rocks, on the walls, if only he looks up and sees the sky, oh! I saw the sky! He stretched out his tender leaves to absorb the air, to withstand the sun, to sing in the rain, and to dance in the wind.\nHe may be under the shade of a big tree, or it may be overburdened by a big tree, but the strength of his youthful growth finally made him break free through the branches and leaves, and stand upright under the scorching sun! When he encounters a splendid spring, he may bloom a tree full of flowers, bees and butterflies flutter around him and make a noise, birds sing on his branches, he will hear the yellow warbler sing, the cuckoo sings blood, and maybe also hear the owl The chirping of birds.\nWhen he grows into the most prosperous middle age, he stretches out his thick shade like a cover, to shade the delicate flowers and grasses under the tree, and he bears a lot of fruits to present the endless sweetness and fragrance of the earth. The autumn wind blew his leaves from dark green to crimson. Under the autumn sun, he was more solemn and splendid. It was not the pride of flowering, nor the joy of the result, but the tranquility and joy after success!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ak4R6oalJWvZqPt3FIri6.png?height=266&width=445)\n\n\nFinally one day, the winter wind rolled down his dry yellow leaves and shook him.

It grows into a small tree again, and then passes through the dense cover, and then listens to the singing of the yellow warbler, but I dare not speak of the next life, nor do I dare to believe in the next life.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7mgEp5J_YNqwGRYfktLEa.png?height=267&width=435)\n\n\nThe universe is a big life, and we are a breath in the atmosphere of the universe. The river flows into the sea, and the leaves fall back to their roots. We are a leaf and a drop of the great life. In the big life of the universe, how humble and insignificant we are, and the activity and growth of a drop and a leaf synthesize the evolutionary operation of the entire universe. Remember: not every river can flow into the sea, and what does not flow becomes a dead lake; not every seed can become a tree, and what does not grow becomes an empty shell! Life is not always happy, nor is it always painful, happiness and pain go hand in hand. It is equivalent to the fact that the water channel has to pass through different banks, and the trees have to pass through the four seasons. In joy we should thank life, in pain we should also thank life. Happiness is exciting, but pain is not beautiful?

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还有总量25% 的代币面临解锁；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格大幅下跌的风险。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658209695, "digest": "JC8q91xW_xYgtymv2xdzNT9mhmm5M9Keu82wPVQUtqE", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

The heat of summer disappears without a trace at night. Looking up at the sky, there are a few stars on the horizon, dotted with the night. Under my feet, the small road I walk every day is still lonely today, and the silence is beautiful.\nI like nights like this, when the moonlight flows like water. When the hustle and bustle hides into silence, the agile breeze draws the tired heart to linger on the bank of the willows, flying like the wind.\n\n\nWalking slowly, walking in the calm night. There is water-like clarity everywhere, not gorgeous, not gorgeous, but it makes people feel aloof, blurred and charming. There is still a faint floral fragrance in the wind, which is the trace left by the season. In the moonlight, the shadows of the trees whirling, the warm wind shakes the flowers and trees, and the tacit fragrance is swaying. It is elegant and hazy, and the style is infinite in the moonlit night.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Fj8Tv3Phe4XBNirxp7VBE.png?height=283&width=429)\n\n\nThe night is clear, the wind is clear and the moon is bright, and the beauty is like ink. \"The cloud breaks the moon and the flowers play in the shadows, the wind is uncertain, the people are quiet at the beginning, and the bright moon should be full of red.\" I whispered the verse that I didn't know from there, and quietly felt the elegance that bloomed quietly under the moon.\nStaring, watching the stars all over the sky shattered into mottles, falling into the small lotus pond in the distance, reflecting the little water light, pure and leisurely. The fine moonlight, sprinkled with silver and white, reflected in the flowers, turned into crystal dew, mottled and beautiful. I am intoxicated, indulged in the ethereal elegance, light, light, like the quietness of misty rain, ethereal and distant.\nThe night is deep, and the serenity of the road is more intense. I looked towards the bright moon with nostalgia, where a cloud drifted past like a veil, quietly concealing the shyness of the moon. A touch of sweetness, a gentle stretch, the wind is soft and the moon is full, and the night is fading. Let the moonlight fall on the ground. In the moonlight, the memory seems to become transparent as well, stretching the freedom in the breeze, filled with warmth.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-LVwci2zxlMb2u3yPzX-G.png?height=270&width=426)\n\n\nThe gentle moonlight, covering the coldness of the night, the cool wind, blowing recklessly through the window of memory, the beauty in dreams, and the sadness of waiting are all immersed in the silence of the night. A sigh came from far away in the wind, it was the bright moon, and the story hidden in the heart fluttered into a fragrance in the wind, finely broken and faint.\nBorrow a wisp of the wind's feelings, drink a clear and ethereal cup, and enjoy a calm mood with a song of people leaning on the solitary building. That moon, as if coming from the ancient fragrance of ink, was as tranquil as water, accompanied by a wisp of wind, and quietly closed the corners of the flying clothes. With the rhythm of the moon, you can integrate your heart into the tranquility, and feel the kind of pleasant, gentle, exile of the mind of dyeing incense.\nQuietly, let your mind get lost in the cool and dreamy moonlit night. The flower language of the season seems to be heard in the distance, and the heart also begins to listen...", "timestamp": 1658209844, "digest": "i5RtsTuVGLgH4VTve_XXQz0Vo6dqsZGU4OH7_rlzuks", "contributor": "0x72c836ED9809B8b8540C7dbdC0036D321BCA85C3"}

Many literati and writers have written hymns for autumn. They try their best to render the beauty of autumn and spare no effort in writing. It can be seen how charming autumn is. Qiu is the best at distributing his feelings, no matter where he goes, people will feel its caress. Autumn is the best at picking gifts. The gifts it gives to everyone are unique and decorated with the most beautiful love. Qiu is so cute that people can't help but be moved by it, I can't help but call Qiu to collect the ubiquitous love.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B5iDInhmCzFJ3NT4NyGd6.png?height=270&width=381)\n\n\nAutumn love is in the fields, look!\nPieces of golden color, trees full of heavy fruits are gifts of autumn. Autumn is generous and selfless, yet it is only generous and selfless to the hard-working people, and its gifts are in return for them. The golden yellow everywhere reminds me of the spring jasmine flowers. The golden yellow that people love is full of mature charm.\nThe bright color reflected in people's eyes, and turned into a thick smile, covering the brows and the bottom of the eyes. I religiously picked up a piece of gold and put it in my heart.\nAutumn love is in the far-reaching sky. Looking up, his eyes are full of fresh azure blue. Occasionally, a few soft clouds floated leisurely in front of my eyes, like a boat gently rowing past. I suddenly felt that it was not that I was looking up at the sky, but that the sky embraced me and embraced me with its broad mind. At this point, I seemed to be separated from myself and completely indulged in its gentle embrace. Autumn love on blooming flowers. That standout flower is the chrysanthemum. Chrysanthemum, it is neither delicate nor luxurious. But its extraordinary temperament and arrogant attitude attract everyone. In front of it, you will think of the word \"arrogant\". Yes, they are arrogant, and they do not hide their arrogance, nor do they pretend, but stand upright with their strong and iron bones, and bear people's eyes proudly and calmly. We should be grateful for the love given to us in autumn. When the flowers fall and before the cold comes, it brings us such a strong vitality of life. This should be the best gift for us.\nAutumn love is in the autumn leaves. Autumn leaves are the most indispensable ornaments in autumn; only with them can a complete autumn be called.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vpawV6vJcBzojGoDGG6FI.png?height=266&width=471)\n\n\nIt is no wonder that the deepest love in autumn is always sprinkled on the moment when the leaves are fluttering with the wind and the wind is dancing with the leaves. It belongs to each of us. We can enjoy the dancing of the fallen leaves on a charming evening and listen quietly. The low singing of the autumn wind, let them affect the tenderness in my heart.\nSome people say that the autumn wind is ruthless, perhaps because it shakes off the dead leaves and scatters the warmth. However, is the autumn wind really ruthless? I think of it as \"Tao is ruthless yet affectionate\". When a trace of autumn wind blew, it brought the news of autumn. It spreads a smile and gently brushes away the irritability of summer. It dances gracefully, holding the fallen leaves and rushing to the ground...", "timestamp": 1658210116, "digest": "bq0UX_GFyV6XFlYfQRS8L7rzjYaL3KL52rmbgOgccto", "contributor": "0x72c836ED9809B8b8540C7dbdC0036D321BCA85C3"}

ETH 的发展决定了 ENS 的发展；\n2. 大量炒作、尝鲜的用户的域名到期后，再叠加上加密市场的遇冷，收入数据可能面临中短期大幅下降的压力；\n3. $ENS 目前缺少赋能。且未来 3.5 年内还将面临总量 25% 的解锁抛压；\n4. 炒作潮中的高价域名在未来可能面临价格的缩水。\n\n### $ENS 估值评估\n\nENS 的域名服务是对 ETH 生态的完善，因为跟随 ETH 获得了巨大发展红利，目前拥有广泛的群众基础，护城河也较深。但是 $ENS 与项目本身并没有强关联性，$ENS 目前仅能捕获协议利好消息带来的情绪价值。更加值得注意的是 ENS 是 Web3 中的非常重要组成部分，但并非不可或缺的一部分。\n\n### ENS 域名交易分析\n\n近三个月的 ENS 域名交易占到总交易量的绝对比例，由此作者截取了此段数据作为分析区间，主要发现：ENS 域名交易中数字域名叫好也叫座；字母、文字域名叫好不叫座，混合域名则是不叫好也不叫座。考虑 ENS 域名整体的流动性较低，非数字域名的炒作均有着很高的流动性风险，综合来看 4 字域名是目前更为合适的投资标的。\n\n【个人思考】\n\nENS \n\n【相关链接】\n\n[https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs](https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/-hgyPi_y_Hy9f8PEBNts3yc4EFNT4b5GKhSedM4qOzs)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658209939, "digest": "jo_BD6uHKra6v_cF9Cpzz9hwyTIUX8JOQCwX7OmWJug", "contributor": "0x311A9BD7cB71703AC83B0620bb0C0FA1545CebcF"}

But there is a catch… You need to have the [portal key](https://opensea.io/collection/sworldc) to enter the 🛰️[SLATANWORLD](https://slatan.xyz/world)🌐 and some amount of **ROTI**. \n\n### Tf is ROTI?\n\nLet’s agree to disagree. Let’s call it *Fans Token*.\n\nIn this *crypto* or *Web3* space, **ROTI** is just like any other *shitcoins* available out there; be it on CEX like Binance, Huobi, FTX, or DEX like UNISWAP, MATCHAXYZ, SUSHISWAP. The *shitcoins*, with the likes of SHIBA, XRP, ELONCUM etc, they all possesses one common, if not similar, trait.

Project fundamentals? FOMO? Affiliate marketing? PEER PRESSURES? 🤔💭 Free market anyways 🤷🏼\n\n### Why is ROTI in 🛰️SLATANWORLD🌐?\n\nThe goal to just use **ROTI** in 🛰️SLATANWORLD🌐 is that it’s important to define a common list of rules if you try to build a game-like space, and while at the same time to assure it’ll serve powers to your creative drives. You don’t want the ever existing noise from ‘monetary values’ to keep distorting your creative process.

Some people say that time is passing, it flows forward without looking back, it does not stop because of beauty, and it does not retreat because of ups and downs; some people say that time is leaving, and what has been experienced is like the growth ring leaving traces in the heart, and it is also like shellfish. The stone sinks in the sea of ​​​​heart, either deliberately or inadvertently, and the memory of the past years is salvaged.\nThe second hand on the clock moves step by step, catching the pulse of time and keeping pace with time; like a heartbeat, it matches the pulse of the body and synchronizes with life. Some people feel that life is a competition, and the pursuit of everything is ahead; some people feel that they are left behind by time, and there is only one left to move forward. And time itself walks slowly and slowly, no matter how fast or slow it is.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gk57bfDal9tGQFCy2vUAV.png?height=270&width=390)\n\n\nSome people are passive and sluggish in time, and some people grow up actively in time; some stories have seen the end in time, and some stories have just started in time. And sometimes, what ends is also a new starting point, and the new starting point and occurrence also contain many past karma.\nThe second hand, minute hand and hour hand on the clock, the second hand is ticking, turning round and round, passing the minute hand and hour hand, every time it is the same, because the minute hand is still the minute hand, the hour hand is still the hour hand, the meaning represented It has not changed; however, each encounter is different because the time represented has changed.\nSometimes the encounter is a reunion after a long absence, and it is also an opportunity for change.\nThe second hand is ticking, like a person who is running around for life, constantly busy and repeating for study and work, people keep walking, day after day, in time, or actively enterprising, working hard for tomorrow; or numb, just Drift with time. In the rotation of day and night, people also study, read and work, and do some positive things, hoping to fill their empty garden of life, but in the passage of time, they will also feel troubled and confused.\nFortunately, in the turn of time, there is still a reunion and encounter. The second hand moves around in circles, growing up day by day. In the home of time, there are minute and hour hands that accompany it, just like its parents.\nWhen the second hand and the minute hand meet, it has a feeling of coming home. The minute hand and the second hand are family affection at the beginning. The second hand is ticking, like a bouncing child. It grows day by day and grows up. On the way, there is closeness or distance with family, there is also the warmth that is integrated with family, and there is loneliness and bravery alone. Later, with the growth of the second hand, it has more emotional expectations, about friendship and love.\nIn the second hand's home, the hour hand is solemn and silent, but the hour hand's words also carry the most weight. Like a serious father, he is not like the minute hand. Every time he walks, he has a step response to himself. The hour hand and the minute hand meet, but the response of the hour to the minute hand is sometimes slow and silent.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ndogpCoHnKWE8Os8aA04w.png?height=266&width=474)\n\n\nThe response of the minute to the second hand, just like the mother's emotional response to the child, affects the child's own emotions, as well as the response and expectation of others' emotions later.

Ordinary people are always moving, constantly changing in their own minds and the external environment, rushing through life, and rarely stopping for comfort and tranquility; there are lovers who wait for the opportunity to move, and have a little more nostalgia and calmness for the present, at the right time. Move to the next moment; practitioners, in the change, are not moving, not chasing, not stubborn, but more of composure and tranquility.\nEveryone is a mortal, and mortals revolve in the world, walking day by day in the twilight of their own mind, day and night, and the development of world affairs.\nTime has no temperature, but human hearts are warm and cold. When people's hearts can fall in love, or meet people who are in love with each other, mortals become affectionate people. Affection brings people together and walks together in time. People without affection and love are indifferent and numb, but those who are overly entangled in love and sinking are fiery and troubled, while those who practice cultivation seek stability and liberation in their hearts, and find cool water in their hearts. , balancing the fiery lust of desire.\nThe second hand, minute hand and hour hand are constantly rotating, different people are also rotating around different goals, ordinary people rotate for desire, fame, money, etc., some lovers rotate for love, affection, spirit, etc.; practitioners rotate for mind, wisdom, etc. .\nDay and night rotate in the forward movement, and also move forward in the rotation. Tsangyang Gyatso said in his poem that turning mountains, waters and pagodas is not to cultivate the next life, but to meet you on the way.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-21h9HtioODcDgq9N6DN4.png?height=285&width=456)\n\n\nWhen you have mountains and rivers in your heart, you will have a yearning for them.

The more compassion of the Buddha in the heart, the less the heart to do evil; the more the wisdom of the Buddha in the heart, the less the heart of trouble.\nWhat is in the heart, what is established, it will rotate and move forward, and on the way, only to meet you on the way.\nSometimes, the flowers haven't bloomed, not because they don't want to bloom, but because the time for them to bloom has not come; Time goes by frame by frame, which can shorten the distance between each other and make each other meet again.\nJust like the second hand, the minute hand and the hour hand, the movement of time makes them separate, but in fact they are never separated, because the hearts are attached to each other and the hearts are together.\nI can't see the time, but I can hear the ticking of the clock, I can see the rotation of day and night, and I can feel the change of seasons.
