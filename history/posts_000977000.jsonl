Let's find out!**\n\n**TLDR** \n\n* Miners Capitulating\n* Consequences of A Capitulation Event\n* Interesting Onchain Activity in Ethereum \n* Binance Whales and Their Masterplan\n\n## Miners Capitulating\n\nIt is no big secret that miners control most of the active bitcoin liquidity. Yes, whales are influential players, but many miners, over time, become whales. And when the miners sell their bitcoin reserves, it points to an eventual bottom of the market. Of course, when miners sell, it leads to short-term dips too. But for long-term enthusiasts of bitcoin, capitulation is a solid buy signal.\n\n**So, what exactly is Miners' reserve?** It is the amount of Bitcoin held by miners. At the same time, it is worth noting that the value accounts for affiliate miners only. That means the reserve excludes old miners who don't have any mining activity now.\n\n### What Is The Status Of Capitulation?\n\nSince 2021, miners have been consistently accumulating bitcoin. It also means that the miners have not realized any significant profit in the last 18 months!\n\n![Capitulation](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yOppEJpWc3CRZ2Em3ytI-.png?height=2700&width=4287)\n\nBut now, miners are forced to sell their biggest bag since 2021.\nSome major reasons are;\n\n1. Increasing mining costs\n2. Decreased price of bitcoin\n\nMany miners are left with no option other than to sell some of their reserves.\n\n### What Are The Consequences?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the most critical consequence is a short-term price fall. There is too much selling pressure from miners and minimal buying pressure from investors. There is a supply-demand mismatch, and the market might settle for a lower bitcoin price.\n\n## Interesting Onchain Activity In Ethereum\n\nEthereum had a great turn of events, especially after [announcing the merge date](https://twitter.com/WeekInEthNews/status/1548101125101867009). It was crucial for the entire altcoin market (most pumped 10-30%). But Ethereum is still trading below its 2018 all-time high.\n\nTwo Transactions caught my attention today.\n\n<https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe150141e9d9e0af32796416d2be37ac7addecd1250117e51a2a5062703752fef>\n\n```\nToday, on 18th July, 20.4K ETH was transferred to the FTX exchange. \n```\n\nThe wallet holds almost $250K worth of assets now, and its primary and secondary wallets hold $48 million and $31 million in assets respectively. Most importantly, the wallets are stable coin dominated and are 2-3 years old.\n\n![source : Etherscan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V6DAyB0uMvJcpCyCqT4hp.png?height=391&width=943)\n\nThis tells us that, at least some of the whales do not believe the bear market is over.\n\n<https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7b760bb4ca67c2492e0453b30c8918eb530bd473defd2a94fe40d4fd1ab98026>\n\n![source : Etherscan](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Et21v-JRCKfZj6NalxkXZ.png?height=391&width=943)\n\nLike the first wallet, this one is also a whale wallet that holds 84.5K ETH and $587 million worth of assets.\n\nThis whale is also panicking, trying to sell all his altcoins.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UpGG38Ma4SsDAxqVFd7bw.png?height=933&width=1363)\n\nThe above two examples tell us three things particularly;\n\n1. Whales are not happy with the market. They will possibly dump on relief rallies. \n2. It is better to take profits when the market is green. \n3. We might experience a long bear market this time.\n\n## Masterplan Of Binance Whales\n\nBinance is the biggest centralized crypto exchange with the most volume and liquidity. These factors make Binance a whale destination. But has the inflows to Binance affected bitcoin?\n\nLet’s see how bitcoin price action is correlated with the exchange inflow into Binance.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cl4MS45nRTUHRCELJcPJ1.png?height=2700&width=4287)\n\nIn mid-march 2022, the exchange inflow to Binance was at moderate levels.\nBitcoin was ranging between 38k and 47k at that time.\n\nBut as soon as the price crashed to 32k in the first week of May, whales started sending their bitcoin holdings to exchanges to sell in profit.\n\nBut the bitcoin price was relatively stable for the next two weeks. Probably whales were looking for exit liquidity, and did not want the price to dip further.\n\nWhales succeeded and were able to sell their BTC at 32k- 30k level, which precipitated another fall to 20k in June 2022.\n\nSince then, BTC has been trading in the 19k - 21k price range. However, on 17th July, inflows broke the moderate levels again!\n\nAre Binance whales planning another dump? Only time will tell.

Join us as we look back on a great fireside chat that spanned a range of topics, from Evgeny’s experience using PWN to the best security practices in DeFi and the future of NFTs.\n\n### Introduction\n\nSteve and [Evgeny](https://twitter.com/evgeny_re7) first met about a year ago, when Evgeny reached out to Steve after both took part in a call together with some folks from [MetaCartel](https://twitter.com/Meta_Cartel). They’ve stayed in touch since then, and just recently, our team has been in touch with Evgeny about a [super exciting Nouns NFT loan](https://twitter.com/pwndao/status/1547854897478963200?s=20&t=Av67GzoUdR5v21bQt1x1Sg) worth $60K that’s currently backed on the PWN platform. Through this process, Evgeny had a chance to get up and personal with our platform.\n\n### What does Re7 Capital think of the PWN platform?\n\nEvgeny was one of the first people to use the recently released version of the [PWN protocol and platform](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/). So what was his experience like while using it?\n\n* **Great UX and UI**: Evgeny mentioned that using PWN is smooth and the process is super straightforward. He’s a fan of our clean UI (and enjoys our simple yet aesthetically pleasing color palette)! \n \n* **Verification made easy**: Using PWN, it’s easy to cross-check assets on OpenSea. This is because we include an asset explorer link (such as Opensea) directly on a loan’s detail page. [Visit PWN](https://pwn.xyz/) to learn more.\n\n### All about the Nouns deal\n\n[Our first Nouns NFT loan](https://twitter.com/pwndao/status/1547854897478963200?s=20&t=Av67GzoUdR5v21bQt1x1Sg) is a big deal. \n\nWe’re extra excited about it, since there are only 374 Nouns in existence with a floor price of 108 ETH (roughly $115,560) per NFT. Around 10,000 Nouns are estimated to be around in the late 2040s, so there’s currently less potential sell pressure and buyers are closely involved through proposals and the nounification of the NFT landscape.\n\nThe Nouns community is one of the most active communities out there, and they actively manage their treasury. What makes this community really stand out is how well-structured it is as well as the fact that the team is composed of real DeFi professionals.\n\nNouns’ average price has been going up over the last \\~120 days, with an average 90-day price of 96 ETH and a 90-day volume of 2,807 ETH. Nouns DAO has implemented some best practices of other blue-chip PFP projects – they’re CC0 and they have been innovating with funding mechanisms. \n\nWhen using the platform, PWN users don’t need to worry about owning an NFT worth 100 ETH. Since PWN is deployed on Polygon, network fees won’t be a problem for NFTs with a smaller value. [Check out the PWN platform for yourself](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/)!\n\n### Steve’s questions for Re7\n\nA large segment of our fireside chat with [Re7](https://twitter.com/Re7Capital) was spent discussing some hot topics in a Q&A session. We’ll sum up some of the questions that Steve had for Evgeny.\n\n**How do you check that you’re interacting with the right contract?**\n\nRe7 carries out dozens of on-chain transactions every day and has been doing so for a year. In the team’s day-to-day activities, maintaining security is a top priority. ”It’s really easy to lose money on the blockchain if you’re not careful”, said Evgeny. “It’s really important to double check everything you’re doing.”\n\nEvgeny emphasized the ongoing need to keep one’s security in check while mentioning a few notable industry vulnerabilities, such as the exploits affecting [Convex](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/24/convex-finance-sets-up-new-urls-after-website-address-is-hijacked/), [Harmony](https://decrypt.co/104138/north-korean-attackers-behind-100m-harmony-hack-report), and [Solana’s Wormhole](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/03/solanas-sol-tumbles-10-after-326m-wormhole-exploit/).\n\nA couple pieces of advice to stay on top of one’s security are as follows: Always be sure to [verify contract addresses on Etherscan](https://info.etherscan.com/how-to-verify-address-ownership/#:\\~:text=Step%201%3A%20Upon%20clicking%20on,able%20to%20sign%20the%20message.) and check that any collateral is really what you think it is. \n\n**Do you proactively revoke approvals that you think you won’t be using in the future?**\n\nThe Re7 team finds it the most efficient to carry out periodic reviews. “The reality is that if you’re doing this all the time, it can become painful,” said Evgeny. In order to bolster security, they also make use of many different wallets — that way, if someone gets unlucky, they’re able to contain the damage.\n\n**Do you get a lot of scammy content in your DMs?**\n\nRe7 receives *a lot* of scammy messages on their channels. As a rule of thumb, the only people who they respond to and communicate with are those who they actively know. Otherwise, they choose to block other DMs, around five to seven of which they receive daily on Twitter.\n\nEvgeny’s advice: If you get a message from someone you don’t know asking for information and/or help, it’s best to assume it’s a scam until proven otherwise\n\n**How does Re7 Capital evaluate risks when investing? Has the playbook changed in any way now that we’re in a bear market?**\n\nEvgeny pointed out the importance of distinguishing between real risk and the perception of risk. He compared dealings within DeFi with the oft-cited quote, “If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.” He commented that there’s a similar result in DeFi; in other words, “If you don’t know where the yield is coming from, you’re the yield.”\n\nIn regards to the current state of the market, Re7 sees how the perception of risk has affected how people manage their money. Because liquidity has dried up, the playbook has changed and is currently evolving at a rapid pace.\n\n### Thoughts on DAOs\n\nAs the conversation turned to the topic of DAOs, Evgeny went over a few key facts about Re7’s organizational structure: Re7 has its own investment fund, and Evgeny is a part of MetaCartel. The company is fully regulated and compliant in what they do, which ultimately protects them as a business. Re7 decided against moving to a DAO, but in general, they feel that certain organizational structures are relevant for a company’s respective use case.\n\nAccording to Evgeny, investment teams can either choose to be very open or opt for efficiency over openness. His team’s experience has demonstrated that communication in a more closed environment allows for making decisions instantly.\n\n### Final reflections\n\nTwo things that Evgeny is excited about looking ahead are NFTs and the metaverse. He was curious how the PWN team envisions the future of NFTs.\n\nAs Steve put it, “We need to see a proper marriage between NFTs and the DeFi ecosystem”. He recently dove into the importance of this topic during a talk on how to onboard a billion DeFi users (more on that in [our recent monthly digest](https://pwn.mirror.xyz/I6TjFg0MVUZx542XnKzsZDs1P4UzrOtrRk86a4i6lYQ)).\n\nIn the next six months, PWN will be able to do things with NFTs that web2 has never even dreamed of — so stay tuned! For now, check out the platform to:\n\n* See how much others are willing to lend\n* Check out the loans available at the moment\n* See other NFT collections that are currently listed\n* …and more!\n\n[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PWNFinance) to stay as up to date as possible on our team’s daily activities.\n\n\n---\n\n**A massive thank you to Evgeny and Re7 Capital for teaming up with us for this session. We’re excited to see where things continue to take us together.** ", "timestamp": 1658144795, "digest": "2SvdL9Jt2QR5IkatMqXxo7B2CIt9UK-T2_clqnMh_dI", "contributor": "0xb52a0e0CF7e6c50e003c07162F8762aDeD5c2539"}

VERI-ZEXE покращує сучасний рівень \\[1\\] приблизно в 9,0 разів при генерації транзакцій і в \\~ 2,6 рази при використанні пам’яті, і використовуватиметься в майбутніх версіях CAPE, щоб увімкнути довільну політику ресурсів, визначену користувачем, зберігаючи можливість налаштування конфіденційність активів.\n\nПерегляньте документ ePrint [тут](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/802.pdf) і GitHub [тут](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/veri-zexe).\n\n## ZEXE: історія та обмеження\n\n Системи розумних контрактів, такі як Ethereum і Solana, є чудовим середовищем для інновацій web3. Однак вони страждають від відсутності конфіденційності або масштабованості, а іноді і того, і іншого. Щоб забезпечити публічну перевірку, усі стани програм та зміни станів є публічними та прозорими, жертвуючи конфіденційністю, а всі транзакції чи обчислення повторно виконуються всіма (повними) вузлами, що впливає на масштабованість.\n\nУ 2019 році Боу та ін. запропонував схему під назвою децентралізоване приватне обчислення (DPC), яка дозволяє користувачам виконувати довільні обчислення поза ланцюгом і надсилати транзакцію, що засвідчує правильність цих обчислень, використовуючи докази з нульовим знанням \\[2\\]. Вони впровадили систему під назвою ZEXE (zk-виконання), яка створює екземпляр схеми DPC для вирішення обох проблемних моментів, наведених вище. Приблизно, ZEXE — це «програмований Zcash», узагальнений від системи з одним додатком до системи смарт-контрактів із збереженням гарантій конфіденційності.\n\nДеякі варті уваги особливості ZEXE:\n\n* **Конфіденційність даних і функцій**: ZEXE приховує всі стани програми, а також входи/виходи для викликів функцій (конфіденційність даних) і, що важливо, *які функції/програми викликаються* в кожній транзакції (конфіденційність функції). Навіть з численними подальшими альтернативними підходами до приватних смарт-контрактів, ZEXE залишається єдиною конкретною конструкцією, яка забезпечує конфіденційність функцій (див. [відповідний розділ роботи](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/802.pdf#subsection.1.1.3) в статті).\n\n\n* **Програмованість**: за допомогою ZEXE користувачі можуть приєднувати довільні правила/предикати до запису (подібно до ідеї Bitcoin Script), який визначає правила переходу для відповідних станів програми. Bowe та ін. показали, як програмувати визначені користувачем активи, DEX і стейблкоїни, що відповідають нормам, у моделі ZEXE.\n\n\n* **Коротка перевірка**: валідаторам у мережі не потрібно повторно виконувати обчислення. Натомість вони перевіряють короткі докази дійсності транзакцій, що займає постійний час, незалежно від того, наскільки дорогими є обчислення поза мережею.\n\nІснуючі реалізації (SnarkVM testnet 1 і SnarkVM testnet 2) забезпечують описані вище функції, але мають недоліки, які обмежують їх практичність і залишають багато можливостей для вдосконалення: \\[3\\]:\n\n* **Спеціальне налаштування схеми**: ZEXE (SnarkVM testnet1) використовує неуніверсальні SNARK, як-от GM17 і Groth16, для сертифікації правильності виконання смарт-контрактів, що забезпечує надійне налаштування для кожної програми, що є дуже непрактичним.\n\n\n* **Продуктивність**: ZEXE з універсальним SNARK (SnarkVM testnet2) зазнає значного погіршення продуктивності через вищу складність універсальної логіки перевірки SNARK і того факту, що ZEXE вимагає створення доказу SNARK для заяви, яка кодує логіку перевірки SNARK.\n\n## VERI-ZEXE: універсальне налаштування без втрати продуктивності\n\n\nVERI-ZEXE вирішує дві вищезазначені проблеми, зберігаючи всі функції та властивості оригінального ZEXE, запроваджуючи багато оптимізацій для зменшення складності схеми універсального гаджета верифікатора SNARK. Ми відсилаємо читачів до статті VERI-ZEXE для детального опису цих методів; у цьому дописі ми лише демонструємо та інтерпретуємо результати наших тестів.\n\nПо-перше, ми порівнюємо себе з найсучаснішими реалізаціями ZEXE, серед яких найважливіші показники включають час генерації транзакції (тобто алгоритм `Execute`), використання пам’яті та розмір підтвердження дійсності транзакції. Як показано нижче, наша продуктивність відповідає оригінальному неуніверсальному ZEXE. Порівняно з найкращою універсальною реалізацією ZEXE ми досягли **\\~9,0-кратного покращення генерації транзакцій** і **\\~2,6-кратного покращення використання пам’яті.**\n\n![Порівняння трьох реалізацій DPC для транзакції 2 входи-2 виходи, що працюють на AMD EPYC 7R13 на частоті 2,65 ГГц із 64 ядрами та 128 ГБ оперативної пам’яті.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rY8a286rowibKu_nFngdu.png?height=266&width=1270)\n\nПо-друге, ми надаємо детальніше порівняння з SnarkVM testnet2. Як показано нижче, розмір нашої зовнішньої схеми (яка використовується під час композиції перевірки глибини 2) набагато менший, і, отже, час перевірки на порядок швидший, що призводить до набагато швидшого створення перевірки для всіх параметрів транзакції:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SPBYiuOpU4eXLyGCjaVnH.png?height=968&width=1364)\n\nНарешті, щоб проілюструвати наші інновації в системі обмежень TurboPlonk і UltraPlonk, а також наші методи оптимізації, ми надаємо розбивку вартості обмежень для криптографічних будівельних блоків, які використовуються у VERI-ZEXE. Ми поділилися цими основними моментами щодо складності гаджетів, коли представили нашу бібліотеку Jellyfish на початку цього року.\n\nКількість PLONK обмежено для основних криптографічних будівельних блоків і алгебраїчних операцій. Ці цифри є специфічними для конструкції TurboPlonk.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/244YxLT5O1JV4p70X7Wwe.png?height=774&width=928)\n\n## VERI-ZEXE + CAPE: настроювана політика активів\n\nНезважаючи на те, що ZEXE не є ідеальним рішенням для приватних смарт-контрактів (через інші проблеми, згадані в \\[3\\]), це чудове рішення для додатків із мінімальними спільними станами серед користувачів, які насолоджуватимуться високим паралелізмом і низькою залежністю від транзакцій за умов Модель UTXO. Продукт [CAPE](https://www.espressosys.com/blog/cape-configurable-asset-privacy-for-ethereum) є чудовим прикладом того, як це може виглядати для користувачів.\n\nНаразі наш протокол CAPE підтримує лише попередньо визначений набір політик активів (наприклад, увімкнення карбування, анонімних передач, заморожування ключів, призначені політики перегляду тощо), але не підтримує динамічні, визначені користувачем політики активів. Уявіть, що ви хочете створити новий «концертний токен», який має загальну кількість 1000 одиниць і може бути викарбуваний, лише якщо певний актив буде сплачено на вказану адресу. Ця нова політика карбування, пов’язана з нашим новим токеном концерту, виходить за рамки того, що може застосовувати поточний продукт CAPE. Це загальна вимога та бажана функція для емітентів активів, щоб мати можливість розробляти індивідуальні, більш складні політики для своїх майбутніх активів. VERI-ZEXE зробить таку можливість програмування можливою.\n\n«VERI-ZEXE може служити основою для приватних смарт-контрактів. Порівняно з попередньою роботою, він підтримує універсальне налаштування та \\~9x прискорення генерації транзакцій, а також \\~2,6x економію використання пам’яті, підштовхуючи такі програми, як приватні стейблкоїни, з довільна, настроювана політика активів у сфері практичності», – каже Алекс Сюн, перший автор.\n\nБіньї Чен, головний криптограф Espresso Systems, додав: «Методики, що лежать в основі VERI-ZEXE, не обмежуються забезпеченням конфіденційності, але також допомагають у масштабованості. Наприклад, ті самі методи можна використовувати для оптимізації продуктивності так званих zk-zk -rollup, де зведення застосовується до форматів транзакцій із нульовим знанням (приватних), таких як CAP або Zcash.\"\n\nМи опублікуємо більше про наші розробки для вдосконалення CAPE у наступних публікаціях і дуже раді, що ці новаторські інновації принесуть Espresso. Залишайтеся на зв'язку!\n\n## Виноски\n\n\\[1\\]: SnarkVM від Aleo має багато ітерацій: їх версія testnet1 є досить точною реалізацією ZEXE, описаною в документі S&P19, яка вимагає довірених налаштувань для конкретної програми; рання версія testnet2 замінює систему доказів, яка використовувалася для створення доказів для предикатів народження/смерті, з GM17 на Marlin, роблячи систему «універсальною»; пізніша версія testnet2 і майбутні версії testnet відходять від оригінальної моделі DPC, спрощуючи модель, але обмежуючи її програмованість (наприклад, забороняючи міжпрограмний виклик). Нова, спрощена, але обмежена модель DPC, оскільки testnet3 виходить за межі цього блогу, а наш код порівнюється з testnet1 і попередньою версією testnet2. Ми внесли додаткові модифікації в їхній код, щоб зробити справедливе порівняння під час бенчмарку, див. докладніше в розділі 4.2 статті.\n\n\\[2\\]: Загальний потік обчислень поза ланцюгом і перевірки підтвердження цілісності обчислень у ланцюзі може звучати схоже на zk-rollup. Користувачі в ZEXE генерують підтвердження дійсності транзакції та надсилають транзакції безпосередньо в ланцюжок, тоді як користувачі в zk-Rollup надсилають транзакцію валідаторам зведення, які потім створять підтвердження zk для надсилання в ланцюг. Технічно ZEXE не хвилює, як виконується обчислення поза ланцюгом: одним користувачем, чи багатокористувацьким протоколом MPC, чи зведеним сервером, тому ми вважаємо ці два підходи взаємодоповнюючими.\n\n\\[3\\]: Є багато інших проблем із ZEXE, зокрема проблема паралельності (коли кілька користувачів намагаються одночасно перевести спільний стан у новий стан), можливість атомарної композиції (досягнення програми, подібної до Flashloan, у ZEXE потребуватиме техніки, яку ми називаємо «в -нагромадження пакетів», які трохи змінюють нано-ядро запису (RNK) ZEXE), складність програмування предикатів у моделі UTXO (існуюче рішення, таке як Chialisp). Ми спробуємо представити наші підходи до деяких із цих проблем у наступних публікаціях блогу.", "timestamp": 1658145126, "digest": "yk47ira6H0aBxcDu6OTM7YH1ZQYAd_BYkNF8edYdy5o", "contributor": "0x9b8EcC555143FC33b9809e7F4DC69179161208aE"}

A criatividade nas ideias é assombrosa. Existem iniciativas para[ distribuir de óculos a crianças](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12),[ criar uma marca de feijão exclusiva da Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/vote/97) e até um[ patrocinar um time de esportes radicais em nome da organização](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n8fhWrjrnUxMk4LE3JkGq.png?height=527&width=953)\n\n[Os dados](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vr6HSACMRce3SExF5tQNVIzqL8oPs5TOpgFRoYxWHbA/edit?usp=sharing) sugerem pouco interesse da comunidade em usar o tesouro para fomentar *public goods.* Somente 13%¹ destinaram-se a este objetivo, somando cerca de U$1.75M² do investimento aplicado em propostas pela DAO. Destacam-se as[ doações para a UNICEF](https://nouns.wtf/vote/42), ao[ instituto sem fins lucrativos do Tony Hawk](https://nouns.wtf/vote/40) e a campanha de[ distribuição de óculos para crianças](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/67zjdY3dSU_2KmStIampQ.png?height=552&width=1244)\n\nCom a intenção de viabilizar o acesso ao capital da Nouns para projetos de menor porte, em dezembro de 2021,[ uma proposta aprovada na DAO originou a Prop House.](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23) Seu diferencial é que qualquer um pode apresentar uma ideia e requerer fundos, mesmo sem possuir um NFT da organização.\n\n![Na Prop House, cerca de U$42 mil foram destinados a propostas voltadas para financiar bens públicos.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NvYxfbAZ5viecNzxMOphr.png?height=527&width=953)\n\nAté o momento, [192 projetos foram beneficiados](https://prop.house/) com o programa, a um custo de \\~U$150.000 para a Nouns DAO.

Ambas são fundamentais para a organização prosperar. Mas, para que a NounsDAO ganhe legitimidade além da criptosfera, parece prudente escapar à circularidade do modelo de \"*captar dinheiro para se auto-promover para captar mais dinheiro*\". Aqui vão 2 ideias:\n\n* **Desenvolver uma Prop House voltada para investimentos em *public goods.*** Nos moldes das Prop Houses que já existem..\n* **Estabelecer um comitê ou diretriz para *public goods*.** Recentemente, a DAO aprovou [a criação do Nouncil](https://nouns.wtf/vote/67): um comitê de membros com remuneração fixa, com base no histórico de participação em votações e discussões. Este comitê poderia debater e sugerir uma \"alocação desejada\" do caixa da comunidade para bens públicos, que sirva de diretriz, ou até designar um sub-comitê para fomentar esse tipo de iniciativa dentro da organização.\n\nAcima de qualquer crítica, vale ressaltar: uma pesquisa como essa só é possível por conta da transparência nos processos da NounsDAO. Este é, sobretudo, o olhar de um observador externo.\n\n[Como diria o Punk 4156](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12), um \"*pool* de capital de fato não-permissionado não tem como ter um propósito totalmente explícito\". Será sujeita ao \"mercado de ideias\", e as melhores vencerão.

Este poder ainda é difícil de perceber, pra quem habita fora da criptosfera. Como boa parte da indústria, Nouns ainda são extremamente auto-referenciais.\n\nO que significa \"*nounificar o mundo*\", afinal?

O significado dessa missão é fluido, e objeto de debate.\n\nJá se falou em tornar os óculos quadrados da Nouns DAO tão [conhecidos e desejados](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1509173517354418180) quanto marcas como [Nike](https://twitter.com/b00tgm/status/1521166004855922696), Gucci ou Ferrari.\n\nJá se postulou que a organização deva priorizar [investimentos em \"bens comuns\"](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12) (*public goods*): projetos educacionais, sociais ou que gerem benefícios coletivos.\n\nHá quem creia que um status como o de marcas famosas só será obtido caso a DAO consiga juntar as duas coisas: a vontade de ostentar com a capacidade de transformar o capital dos ostentadores em algo de útil para a sociedade.\n\n![Etapas para propostas serem apresentadas, votadas e executadas na governança da Nouns DAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j3GQmKIVZdJ4KJgx0ni0W.png?height=874&width=1600)\n\nDepois de um ano de vida, a Nouns DAO investiu \\~U$29.76M nas 102 propostas apresentadas em sua governança. A criatividade nas ideias é assombrosa. Existem iniciativas para[ distribuir de óculos a crianças](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12),[ criar uma marca de feijão exclusiva da Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/vote/97) e até um[ patrocinar um time de esportes radicais em nome da organização](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n8fhWrjrnUxMk4LE3JkGq.png?height=527&width=953)\n\n[Os dados](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vr6HSACMRce3SExF5tQNVIzqL8oPs5TOpgFRoYxWHbA/edit?usp=sharing) sugerem pouco interesse da comunidade em usar o tesouro para fomentar *public goods.* Somente 13%¹ destinaram-se a este objetivo, somando cerca de U$1.75M² do investimento aplicado em propostas pela DAO. Destacam-se as[ doações para a UNICEF](https://nouns.wtf/vote/42), ao[ instituto sem fins lucrativos do Tony Hawk](https://nouns.wtf/vote/40) e a campanha de[ distribuição de óculos para crianças](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/67zjdY3dSU_2KmStIampQ.png?height=552&width=1244)\n\nCom a intenção de viabilizar o acesso ao capital da Nouns para projetos de menor porte, em dezembro de 2021,[ uma proposta aprovada na DAO originou a Prop House.](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23) Seu diferencial é que qualquer um pode apresentar uma ideia e requerer fundos, mesmo sem possuir um NFT da organização.\n\n![Na Prop House, cerca de U$42 mil foram destinados a propostas voltadas para financiar bens públicos.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NvYxfbAZ5viecNzxMOphr.png?height=527&width=953)\n\nAté o momento, [192 projetos foram beneficiados](https://prop.house/) com o programa, a um custo de \\~U$150.000 para a Nouns DAO. Este dinheiro catalisou projetos de [reflorestamento](https://prop.house/proposal/149), [educação web3](https://prop.house/proposal/56) e até a criação de uma [marca de maconha da Nouns DAO](https://prop.house/proposal/112).\n\nNa Prop House, a baixa oferta de ideias voltadas a *public goods* permanece: **13,5% das propostas apresentadas na Prop House buscaram este fim.**\n\nDentre as propostas aprovadas, **27% voltam-se para *public goods*.** A porcentagem é maior em relação à governança principal da Nouns DAO, mas o dinheiro arrecadado via Prop House é substancialmente menor.\n\nHá um desequilíbrio entre iniciativas com benefícios coletivos e ações de marketing. Ambas são fundamentais para a organização prosperar. Mas, para que a NounsDAO ganhe legitimidade além da criptosfera, parece prudente escapar à circularidade do modelo de \"*captar dinheiro para se auto-promover para captar mais dinheiro*\". Aqui vão 2 ideias:\n\n* **Desenvolver uma Prop House voltada para investimentos em *public goods.*** Nos moldes das Prop Houses que já existem..\n* **Estabelecer um comitê ou diretriz para *public goods*.** Recentemente, a DAO aprovou [a criação do Nouncil](https://nouns.wtf/vote/67): um comitê de membros com remuneração fixa, com base no histórico de participação em votações e discussões. Este comitê poderia debater e sugerir uma \"alocação desejada\" do caixa da comunidade para bens públicos, que sirva de diretriz, ou até designar um sub-comitê para fomentar esse tipo de iniciativa dentro da organização.\n\nAcima de qualquer crítica, vale ressaltar: uma pesquisa como essa só é possível por conta da transparência nos processos da NounsDAO. Este é, sobretudo, o olhar de um observador externo.\n\n[Como diria o Punk 4156](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12), um \"*pool* de capital de fato não-permissionado não tem como ter um propósito totalmente explícito\". Será sujeita ao \"mercado de ideias\", e as melhores vencerão. Talvez o empurrão que a DAO precise para se conectar mais intimamente \"ao mundo material\" não venha de dentro, mas de fora.\n\n[4156 especulou](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12) que o \"superpoder da organização\" é \"proporcional à sua capacidade de tornar o mundo melhor para todos\". Este poder ainda é difícil de perceber, pra quem habita fora da criptosfera. Como boa parte da indústria, Nouns ainda são extremamente auto-referenciais.\n\nO que significa \"*nounificar o mundo*\", afinal?

"**Tokenomics**（トークノミクス）はクリプトプロジェクトにおいて最も重要な項目の一つ。\n\n「トークノミクスを理解しないと成功しない」という人も中にはいます。\n\n今回は[Covduk氏](https://twitter.com/Cov_duk)の協力を得てトークノミクスについてまとめました。\n\nプロジェクトやトークンに関する前提知識がないと少し難しい内容かもですが、できるだけ分かりやすくまとめたので本記事を読んでトークノミクスについて詳しくなりましょう。\n\n## トークノミクスとは?\n\nまず「トークノミクスとはなにか」と言われると一般的には、トークンの絡んだ経済やインセンティブという抽象的なものを指す言葉です。広義として以下のようなものを含みます。\n\n* トークンの仕組み\n* 需要と供給\n* トークンにまつわるメカニズム\n* インセンティブ、心理学、行動学\n* ゲーム理論\n\nなどなど、トークノミクスの語源にもなっている「**Token**」の「**Economics**」、経済の部分ですね。\n\n## 需要と供給\n\n「トークノミクス＝需要と供給」と過言ではないぐらい重要なポイント、まずはわかりやすいトークンの供給の部分から順番に見ていきましょう。\n\n### トークノミクスで生み出すトークンの供給\n\n供給量をコントロールすることで簡単にトークンに希少性を出すことが可能です。\n\n例えば需要が一定である場合、市場への供給量が少ないほど希少性により価値が上昇します。\n\nプロジェクトにおいては、トークンの価値を維持・上昇させるために、供給量を固定して過度なインフレを防ぐなどの工夫をいくつか行っています。\n\n* Bitcoin\n\nBitcoinを例に上げるとわかりやすいかもしれません。Bitcoinが通貨や資産として優れていると言われる理由の一つとしてこのトークノミクスが関係しているからです。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jX1Adfxkda-30eo1CVjwX.png?height=340&width=680)\n\nBitcoinの最大供給量は2100万枚で固定されており、すでに約90%に値する1910万枚が発行されています。ちなみにすべての供給予定量が一気に放出されるわけではありません。\n\nしかし、仮にいまの供給量が突如2倍になったらどうでしょう?\n\n昨日まで買えなくてプレミア価格だったPS5が、どこの店舗にも潤沢な在庫数になったイメージです。供給量が増加するともちろん価値は下がることが予測されます。\n\n話が少し脱線しますが、実はいま似たようなことが起きようとしているのをご存知でしょうか?\n\n* Mt.Gox事件のBitcoin返還\n\n供給量の変化によってもたらされる影響について懸念されているものの一つとして、8年前に人気だった取引所「Mt.Gox」から多くのBitcoinが盗まれたMt.Gox事件があります。\n\n事件によって失われた137,000BTCが返還されようとしています。\n\nBitcoinの供給量から見ると1%未満なものの、実際のところ毎日100%が現物で取引されて循環しているわけではないので、相当な売り圧になるとの予測もあります。\n\n自分も市場価格に大きな影響を与えると感じており、この件に関してはツイートもしくはmirrorに改めて投稿します。\n\n### 希少性の維持\n\n希少性が維持される条件として、上で挙げたBitcoinの方法など主に3つ存在します。\n\n* 最大供給量の決める（固定する）\n* 一部をBurnするトークン設計\n* トークンの紛失（いわゆるセルフGox）\n\nトークノミクスが不十分なものは、最大供給量および供給を定期的にコントロールして減らす仕組みがない事が多い。\n\n### Burnするトークン設計\n\nトークンは発行（Mint）とは逆の焼却（Burn）をすることもできます。\n\nやっていることは、自社株を買い戻しているのと似ています。\n\nこの仕組を採用している主要な暗号資産にはEthereumやBNBなどが挙げられる。今回はEthereumを例に見てみましょう。\n\n* Ethereum\n\nEthereumのマイナー報酬は大きく分けて、Static Base Reward（基礎報酬）の2ETHと、トランザクション手数料のチップの2種類が存在し、それらの合計がマイナーに支払われます。\n\n上のBurnの仕組みになったのはEIP-1559。手数料（ガス代）のマーケットメカニズムの変更に伴い、トランザクション手数料のチップを除くBase Fee（基本手数料）の部分をBurnする仕組みなりました。\n\nEIP-1559が採用されてからはEthereumのインフレの進行は遅まるどころかデフレトークンになりました。デフレトークンについては下で改めて説明しています。\n\nこのような形で、定期的もしくは何かをトリガーにBurnする仕組みを採用することで意図的に供給量のコントロールを行うこともできます。\n\n### 供給量＜供給率と時間軸\n\nここまで供給について話してきましたが、あくまで重要なのはトークンの総数ではないです。\n\n* 現在のトークン供給量\n* 現在のトークン供給率\n* 残りのトークンを発行する時間軸\n\nこの3つがトークンの供給にかかわる数字、要するに指標として存在します。\n\n仮にあるトークンの設計として、最大供給量を1億枚に設定していたとします。しかし、いまは30%の3000万枚しか市場に出回っていません。この場合は、残りの70%が大きな売り圧などになる可能性があり、トークンの価格に影響を与える可能性が大きくなってしまいます。\n\nそこで時間をかけてトークンを残りの発行してみます。トークンの残り70%を10年かけて放出したとしましょう。その場合、トークン放出による市場価格への影響はかなり小さいと言えるでしょう。\n\nでも70%を向こう1ヶ月で放出する場合はどうでしょう。最悪ですね、大きな売り圧になります。\n\nこのように供給量よりも供給率と時間軸が設計の上で非常に重要になってきます。\n\n### インフレトークン\n\n上でトークノミクスの悪い例として挙げたものの中にインフレトークンを言うものが存在します。\n\n* 供給量が一定じゃない\n* 無限に供給（発行）される\n* Burnの設計が一切ない\n\n供給量の増加に比例し、価値が減少する。いわゆるインフレですね。\n\nDOGEがその代表的な例として挙げられます。供給率は一定数（1分毎に1万枚）で、流通量に上限はありません。\n\n### デフレトークン\n\nインフレトークンとは反対にデフレトークンも存在します。\n\n* 供給量が一定\n* 供給量が減少していく\n* Burnの設計がされている\n\nデフレトークンは供給量を制限し、希少性を高めるという意味でとても良いことです。\n\n### 時価総額とFDV\n\n現在のトークンの価値を測る指標として、トークンの価格の他に時価総額とFDVが存在します。\n\n時価総額は聞き慣れている言葉だと思いますが、FDVはどうでしょう。\n\n* 時価総額\n\n時価総額とは、現在流通している額の総数で、現在の価格×**流通量**で計算できます。\n\n* FDV\n\nFDVとは、Fully Diluted Valuationの略で、日本語では完全希薄化価格といい、今後流通予定のものを含んだ数量の額の総数を指します。現在の価格×**最大供給量**で計算できます。\n\nここからは上の2つを例を上げて具体的に見ていきましょう。\n\n例えばあるトークンAの現在の価格が1ドルだとします。100枚のトークンが流通しており、最大供給量は1,000枚です。\n\nこの場合、時価総額は1×100で100ドル。FDVは1×1000で1,000ドルとなります。\n\n### 時価総額とFDVの比率\n\n時価総額とFDVの比率は、現在供給済みのトークンの割合を示します。\n\nトークンAの場合は1000÷100で10になり、より1に近い小さい数のほうが残りの供給量が少ないです。現在進行形で放出が進んでいるBitcoinは2100÷1910で1.099でかなり1に近い数字です。\n\n時価総額とFDVに大きな差がある場合は、この比率が大きくなり、まだ供給予定のトークンの多くがロックされており時間が経過するごとに放出され希薄化が進みます。\n\nどちらかといえば、プロジェクト運営側というよりもユーザー側の視点になりますが、供給の時間軸（タイミングやスケジュール）、どこからどこに供給れるものなのかを確認しておくことが賢いです。\n\nプロジェクトの成長速度より早いトークン供給によるインフレは大きな売り圧になります。\n\nなので運営側もそこは気をつけて設計する必要があるでしょう。\n\n### トークンアロケーション\n\n過度な供給や集中する供給が価格に対して与えるダメージが大きいことはここまで説明してきました。\n\n過度な供給は仕組みで防げますが、集中する供給はMt.Gox事件しか話してませんでした。\n\n起こりうる事例として実際どのようなものがあるでしょう。トークンの販売の部分から見てみます。\n\n* プライベートセール\n* フェアローンチ\n\nプライベートセールの場合、ローンチ時のトークン価格よりも大幅に割り引かれていることが多く、個人投資家以外にもVCなどがこのラウンドから投資を行いますが、権利が確定するまでには一定期間のロックアップが存在することが一般的です。COINLISTのIEOに参加経験のある人はわかりやすいと思います。\n\nこの場合、ロック期間が終わったときに一定の売り圧が発生する可能性が高くなります。\n\n一部回避する方法として、ロックアップ解除の時期をずらしたり、従来より長いロックアップ期間を許容してくれる投資家に対して、割引や多くステーキング報酬を付与インセンティブを付与する対処を行っています。\n\nこのような情報はCoinGeckoやCoinMarketCap等のサイトには載ってないことが多いので、代わりに公式のドキュメント等を見に行く必要があります。\n\n### VCが生み出す売り圧\n\nすべてのVCが圧力になるとは限りません。あるティア1クリプトVCは、「ロック期間が終わっても一切トークンを売ることはない。」と話してたような、してないような。\n\nトークンを手放す条件、要するに利確を行う条件として下記が考えられます。\n\n* 市況の悪化\n* 運用ファンドの不調\n* ロック解除時のインフレ率\n\nなど、アンロック時に売るインセンティブがどうしても強くなる状況がある。ここは運営側で制御できない部分の不可抗力も大きく、売られることを防ぐことは難しい。では、対策として何ができるのか。\n\n### 初期供給量の調整\n\n初期供給量を少なくしてしまえば、売られる額が市場供給量と比べて相対的に少なくなるから価格変動を極限まで押さえられるのではないか！実はこれは間違っています。\n\n硬い投資家はなぜBitcoinやEthereumを選ぶのか。それは希少性による資産性ですよね。これからの供給による希薄化が少ない、要するにHODLするインセンティブ（値上がりへの期待）の方が大きく、今手放すインセンティブが少ない設計に見せることができているからです。\n\n極端な話、初期供給量が10%のトークンの場合残りの90%を徐々に供給していく形となります。そうなると初期供給量が10%より大きいトークンよりも、初期投資家に与えるダメージは同じ成長度のプロジェクトだとしても比較して大きいと言えるでしょう。\n\n### 供給のトークン設計の分析方法\n\n投資家は下記項目を重点的に見る必要があり、運営サイドも注意する必要がある。\n\n1. トークンの流通量\n2. 供給量の上限があるかどうか\n3. ロックアップ解除のタイミングと割合\n4. Burnの設計を採用しているかどうか\n5. トークン供給のメカニズム\n6. トークンのインフレ率\n7. 供給増加による売却インセンティブ\n8. ロック解除時のインフレ率\n\n### トークノミクスで生み出すトークンの需要\n\nここまではいずれも、トークンの供給に関するもので、ここからはトークンの需要について見ていきましょう。\n\nどんなに供給のメカニズムを工夫して希少価値のあるものができたとしても、需要がなければなんの価値も生まれません。\n\nいま私が寝起きのセルフィーをNFTとしてミントしました。今後追加での発行予定はなく紛れもない1/1です。いままでの話を見ていると、この上なく最高の希少性だとわかりますが、誰もこんなもの要りません。\n\n需要とは様々な条件によって成り立っているのです。\n\n* 今後生まれる価値と収入\n* 実用性があるかどうか\n* 投機、ミームなど\n\n需要を適切にコントロール下に置くことで、リスクを取ってくれた初期参入者に対してインセンティブを発生させたり、トークン価格の上昇として還元することはどのプロジェクトも取り組むべき事項の一つです。\n\n### ユーティリティ\n\nユーティリティには様々な形が存在します。\n\n* 問題を解決するプロダクトやサービス\n* ガス代（チェーンのネイティブトークンなど）\n* プロトコルで利用されるトークン（ガバナンストークンなど）\n* 楽しみの提供（GameFi、音楽など）\n* コミュニティやイベント（BAYCなど）\n\n### 利回りなどのインセンティブ\n\nトークンを保有することによって報酬を得ることができる仕組みは大きな需要に繋がります。\n\nたとえば、RocketPoolでETHをステーキングすると4.03%、Lidoだと3.9%のAPRで報酬がもらえます。\n\nまた単なる金銭的な報酬だけじゃない場合も存在します。\n\n### ガバナンス\n\nトークンを保有するメリットとして、ガバナンスの権利が得られるというものがある。\n\nしかしこれは一般的なホルダーからして果たして魅力的なものなのだろうか?\n\n一定数の需要はあるにしろ。ユーティリティがコレだけでは盛り上がりにかける。\n\n### 高いAPY\n\n魅力的に見えるように高いAPYを見せて人とお金を集める手法がある。\n\n実際魔界などの別名を持ち人とお金が集まっているのでれっきとした需要と言えます。\n\nしかし、このAPYは一時的なものでお金が2倍流入すると半分の利回りになる。いくつかのプロトコルでは利回りを保証するものもあるがごく一部です。\n\n高いAPYは非常に魅力的だがリスクも存在する。\n\n利回りは低下する上に、トークンの価格も供給量が無限に増加していくので低下していくことが予想される。売ることもロクにできないゴミを保有しているも同然になることも多い。\n\nちゃんとしたサービスをローンチしたい場合は運営はなるべく避けるべき判断であることは確か。しかし設計によっては高APYも提供可能になるかも。\n\n### リベース\n\nこの手法はOlympusが導入したもので、株式分割に非常に似ています。\n\nホルダーは従来どおり、ステーキングを行うことでトークンを報酬として受け取ることができます。\n\nしかし供給は増加を続けるので、希薄分をステーキングしたトークンで受け取ることで事実上の保有比率を変えずとも運用可能にしました。\n\nいまでも高い290%の利回りを提供していますが、去年末は8,000%以上の高APYでした。\n\n### Airdrop\n\n特定の条件を満たすユーザーにトークンを無料で配布する手法です。\n\nコアなファンを作る意味でも、金銭的なインセンティブが得られるという期待感からも、運営・ユーザー共に人気の昔からある手段です。\n\nトークンを保有もしくはステーキングすることで、Airdropの対象になるケースや、抽選で配布を行うパターンがよく見られますが、先行利用してくれているユーザーに配布する事もあれば、自分たちのサービスではない特定のプロトコルを利用しているユーザーにばらまく場合もあります。\n\n最近だとCosmosのエコシステムでのエアドロが人気だとか。\n\n### ステーキングトークン\n\nステーキングして報酬が得られる仕組みはトークンの重要を生み出す仕組みとして非常に有用ですが、その文脈で更にブーストさせる方法が存在します。\n\nステーキングトークンとは、ステーキング及びロックしたトークンと引き換えに発行されるトークンのことです。\n\nスキーキングトークンを担保に暗号資産を借りたり、更に運用することができるのが魅力です。\n\n例えばLidoの場合、1ETHをステーキングすると引き換えに、1stETHを受け取ります。\n\nこの1stETHはDEXに流動性供給をおこないファーミングを行ったり、AAVEではstETHが担保として認められているので、stETHを担保にETHを借りてレバレッジステーキングができます。\n\n普通にステーキングよりもこのような形で更に運用できたほうがより多くの報酬が受け取れるので、トークンの需要は更に増すでしょう。\n\n### 投機とミーム\n\n人はお金が大好きで、もちろん投機も大好きです。私たちのこの感覚と同じように、市場も完全な合理性を持って動いているわけではないのが現状です。\n\n他の人が買っているから、信頼できるインフルエンサーが紹介していたから、前のコレクションも価格が上がったから今回のも買っておけば稼げる、やはりFOMOのようなものもあるだろうか。\n\nミームも一種の投機ではないか。クリプトは今までミームによって多大な恩恵を受けてきました。\n\n先程インフレトークンの代表的なものとして紹介したDOGEがはトークノミクスの観点から見ると明らかにクソトークンですが、時価総額10位に位置しています。国内取引所にも上場しています。\n\nそれは何を意味するのか、クリプトはコミュニティ主導で動いている。ミームそのものなのではないかと。\n\nミームによってブーストできる力もあるとして、一定数自分たちの追い風にしないといけないのかもしれない。\n\nいくら頑張って開発しても、ミーム＞トークノミクスの構造に自ずとなってしまっているものも多く存在する。\n\n* プロジェクトに対する強い愛\n* Discordでの活発さ\n* コミュニティに興奮はあるか\n\nこの3つがコミュニティを調査した上でいかにミーム的な付加価値を手供できるかどうかの重要なポイントとになりそうです。\n\n## さいごに\n\nここまでつらつらと書き連ねましたがこんな事をすべて考えて、念入りにトークンの設計をできるだろうか。自分でも書いていてめっちゃ難しいなあという認識です笑\n\nどれだけ完璧だと思う設計をしても、不可抗力や予期せぬことで価格の上下は少なからず起こるもの。\n\nでも完璧に近いトークノミクスを実現するため、経済学に詳しい教授などがトークノミクスのアドバイザーとしてプロジェクトに参画しているのをみてびっくりしました。\n\n価格の上下にユーザーと自分たちのモチベーションが振り回される環境で果たして「このサービスにトークンは必要なのか」問題は、個人的にめっちゃ話したいですがここで話すと長くなるのでまた別の機会に。\n\n長々と話しましたが少しでも参考になると幸いです。また、今回の記事にご協力いただきました[Covduk氏](https://twitter.com/Cov_duk)には改めて感謝します。ぜひフォローしてください！ではまた次のmirrorで会いましょう。\n\n\n---\n\nThank you so much Covduk! 😄\n\n協力: **[Covduk氏](https://twitter.com/Cov_duk)** / **[Tokenomicsのスレッド](https://twitter.com/Cov_duk/status/1547857503739711488)**", "timestamp": 1658145896, "digest": "A_4Zl4x_peQrMmAccPzpQfBDBoyIm8DX8kwc9N-n96U", "contributor": "0xcdaF4F9f8F9141a162f9CA7566FbaCD9237718b8"}

"「flipper访谈计划」是我们和多个NFT二级交易者的访谈合集。我们致力于对话各种风格的交易者，为二级市场交易抽丝剥茧，分享他们赚钱的经历，帮助更多NFT玩家实现稳定盈利。\n\nMartin是币圈老玩家，17年大学没毕业就踏入币圈，一举获得百倍收益，从EOS到合约无不涉猎。21年进入NFT领域，荷兰拍阶段入手红豆，之后都是翻十倍以上出手，仅凭一个项目就获得了超过50ETH的收益。Martin在Web3各个领域的经验，让他非常擅长从项目的初始阶段挖掘项目的潜力，Martin的社群在中文社区最早布局沙特白单，有社群成员通过邀请白单获得10个白单，收益20ETH以上。他还从白单阶段布局了godhates、火把等项目，都获得了不错的收益，也证明了他对项目的判断独特而精准。\n\n这次Martin和我们的访谈聚焦NFT领域从入门到精通各个阶段最应该做的事，和最应该学会的技巧。包括新手入门的方法，早期发现项目的技巧，和二级市场逃顶的方法论。相信不论你是刚进入NFT领域的新手，还是已经了解NFT一段时间的进阶玩家，都能在这篇访谈中得到一些技巧和答案。\n\n## 一 入门 对新手的建议\n\n对于新手来说，从一级市场拿白做起是一个比较好的方式，因为新手大多资金量有限，盲目从大项目开始买可能并不理智。那么，新手应该选择什么样的项目开始拿白和参与？可以看三点：\n\n### 1. 过于PUA的项目不做\n\n很多项目方有一个牛市遗留下来的习惯，就是要求用户做很多任务来获取白名单，包括邀请许多人进DC，在DC不断发言提升等级等等。这种方式拿白费时费力，在牛市的确可能赚钱，但在现今的熊市并不适用。以Martin的经验，这种过于PUA的项目方，往往最终发行的项目质量并不很高，因为他们只会通过比较原始的手段绑定用户，其营销能力令人质疑。而且肝白的时间给不了你任何成长，可以说毫无意义。\n\n相反，我们推荐新手做更容易获取白单的项目，比如评论邀请几个好友，顺手转发一下推特，或者在premint网站上登记一下地址，或者进DC频道发一下地址等。这种白单任务一两分钟就可以搞定，效率很高，能降低你的时间成本，把更多时间用来学习新知识，看新的项目。\n\n### 2. premint多准备几组账号\n\n许多针对新手的建议会说，多准备几个钱包用来打土狗，而Martin建议不仅钱包要准备多个，配套的twitter帐号和DC账号也要准备多个。特别是twitter账号，一定要准备和钱包相同的数量。\n\n因为现在众多优质项目都选择使用premint的方式抽白，同时在premint抽奖大多需要独立的钱包和推特。所以准备的账号组越多，获得白单的机会越高，赚取收益的可能性也就越大。\n\n### 3. 优先关注free mint的项目\n\n对新手来说，最应该优先关注的是freemint的项目。主要原因有二：\n\n一是freemint项目成本可控，即使打多个，也只需要付出gas，即使项目没起来也不会亏太多，风险比较小。\n\n二是一些付费mint的项目，其实质量上并没有比freemint项目高，反而项目方会因为付费mint获得的利益，在mint之后懈怠对项目的运作，这肯定对项目的长远发展不利，也会削弱项目的价值。最终反应到市场上，就是NFT价格下跌甚至归零。所以付费mint并不代表项目质量一定高，看项目还是要从各个方面综合判断。\n\n## 二 进阶 如何判断项目是否优质\n\n那么如何判断项目的质量？Martin向我们总结了三点：\n\n### 1. 通过项目方的外宣初步判断\n\n一级市场的项目，很多都会有预热，这时可以快速浏览一下项目方的推特，以及项目的相关信息，比如有没有知名的KOL或者共同关注点赞。同时也要关注项目的画风，到项目官网去看一下整体的构架等等，然后再决定是否mint。一般项目的官网的精良程度也决定了一个项目的精良程度，如果官网都做不好，项目大概率也不太行。\n\n同时也不能仅仅依靠推特粉丝来判断推，因为特粉丝这种东西比较虚，如果一个项目粉丝很多，但是没什么大V和KOL关注，也没有共同关注的好友，那么项目的粉丝极大概率是刷的。另外，推特下的评论互动也很重要，有的项目评论中一看就知道是机器人，这种项目方就大概率没什么运营水平。\n\n### 2. 通过创新度进一步判断\n\n优秀的项目一定要有创新度。比如哥布林，在哥布林之前，大家都认为NFT要「好看」，但哥布林打破了这个常规。而且哥布林本身的绘图质量很高，为后续的爆火提供了前提。可以说，哥布林的火，很大程度上取决于画风的创新和精美。\n\n而创新本身很难去定义，但当它出现的时候你就能发现。又如前段时间起飞的沙特人，它像素风的图可能第一眼并不陌生，看起来普普通通，但它是第一个把NFT主体定位到沙特地区文化的，这就是很好的创新，而后续的爆火基本是必然。\n\n所以考察NFT的质量，创新是必不可少的一个因素，而创新也是多维度的，不是只有图片创新，在合约，营销，运营，项目故事等任何一个方面有创新都有潜力。有创新性的NFT，几乎天生就比其他NFT优越，遇到这种项目一定不能错过。\n\n### 3. 通过社区获得优质信息\n\n在NFT圈，优质信息往往通过alpha群等核心圈子传播，这种优质社区中的信息价值非常高，往往在项目发布前就能判断出项目质量和后续走势。Martin自己也是Godjira和doodles社群的成员，同时也是优质信息的传播节点，成立了自己的社群。\n\n在社群中获得信息拥有极大优势，因为社群节约了你的时间成本和筛选环节，能直接把优质信息的传递效率提升到最高。如果你还未加入社群，也可以从Martin的推特和社群，或b4fomo的社群开始获得优质信息，迈出进入NFT核心圈的第一步。\n\n如果你通过这几点，判断出了某个项目是有质量的，那么就可以果断出手。不需要过于害怕亏损不敢mint，因为一级市场项目许多都是freemint，成本很低，可以不断试错，而抓住一次机会就能翻很多倍，盈亏比非常高。\n\n## 三 大成 土狗的逃顶策略\n\n经过mint阶段，下一步要做的就是在二级市场出手。这个阶段也是难度最高的，许多NFT玩家不是出手过早卖在低点，就是一直持有直到项目归零。那么如何判断出手的时机？怎样才能出在高点，获得最高的利润？Martin分享了以下三点技巧：\n\n### 1. 入手项目时接多个\n\nNFT和虚拟货币不同，如果只入手一个或者两个，很难做出理性的判断，涨上去想出手又害怕会继续上涨，价格出现下跌又会出现恐慌抛售。为了避免这种不理性的决策，在mint的时候就要尽量多买几只。尤其是对于free mint的项目，本身也没什么成本，这样下判断时才能更从容不迫，获得最大利益。\n\n对于看好的项目，Martin习惯一次接20个左右，这样分批出的时候更游刃有余，比如最近的BALUBA，Martin计算出单只成本3u左右，而这个项目的画风和热度都不错，很有潜力。于是果断mint了20个，即使中间有人砸盘也并不受影响，持有到高点0.04出手，分批出货，平均收益达到了15倍。\n\n### 2. 分批出货，对土狗不能有信仰\n\n对土狗来说，出货的好点位有两个。\n第一个点位是0.02-0.03，这个阶段适合用来回本，当你mint了多个时，可以在这时出掉一部分来回本，保证自己能全身而退。\n第二个点位是0.08-0.1，因为大部分free mint项目很难突破0.1，所以在项目冲到0.08到0.1这个阶段时，可以考虑分批出一些，带来一些盈利。\n\n而在项目出现向下的态势时，就需要考虑及时出货止损。如果你在0.02到0.03阶段已经出了一部分，其实已经覆盖了成本，所以这时候做决策会很从容，无论是留一个全出，还是再观望一段时间，实际上你都是不会亏的。\n\n如果看好项目的未来，决定长期持有，需要注意的是不能被项目方的信息带着走，盲目高估项目未来的价值。在目前的NFT市场，蓝筹是极少数，大多项目都只能火一段时间，当热度过去就没有了买盘，相当于砸在了手里。所以对土狗不能有信仰，按商业逻辑看待项目，才是理性的交易者应该做的。\n\n### 3. 从项目数据判断逃顶时机\n\n最准确判断逃顶时机的方法，还是从数据角度判断。一般挂单越来越多，而买盘开始走弱的时候，项目就到了短期的一个高点，这时候出手可以卖在顶部。\n\n同时，逃顶也要看点位。 当项目价格突破一个价格点位，比如上面提到的0.03，0.1等关键点位时，这个点位会变成支撑位，这个时候一般说明买盘良好，可以多持有看看，当发现买盘衰竭，也就是买单速度下降、买单数量减少时，再进行出手操作；而当项目跌破了支撑点位时，这个点位会变成压力位，短期内再冲上的可能性会变弱，这时挂单价格就需要谨慎，挂在高点很可能难以出手，可以尽快挂当前的地板价快速变现。\n\n而这些实时数据，在OS上是看不到的，所以必须配合工具来看。Martin常用的工具是parsec，同时也用b4fomo，parsec的优点是更专业，K线图和走势清晰，更适合资深玩家和有其他领域交易经验的交易者，b4fomo信息更全面，更适合新手。具体使用什么工具，可以结合自身的交易情况、对NFT交易的了解程度等等来决定。\n\n像买盘和卖盘的比例，价格点位分布，在b4fomo都能清晰地看到。而且b4fomo也有free mint的功能，帮助NFT玩家迅速找到市场上正在mint的所有土狗项目，并可以使用工具一键在合约端mint，既别别人快，还比别人安全。\n\n在访谈的过程中，Martin非常诚恳地介绍了他的NFT经验，这种共建共享的Web3精神也让我们钦佩。同时，Martin也在他的推特 <https://twitter.com/martin23_sen> 中分享他看好的优质项目，也组建了自己的社群，带着伙伴们一起从早期掘金。访谈最后，Martin对我们说，即使现在市场整体处于熊市，但NFT领域始终是局部的热点，不断会有机会涌现，任何在这个领域持续耕耘的人，会在之后的牛市获得意想不到的收获。\n\n您也可以在 <https://www.b4fomo.io/>

{"id": "bdG-6SGkDAPAJ_1quLCzhYy8GfBgMW5UAkOo-RMhNJ4", "title": "Analysis on NFT Liquidity: Problems & Solutions", "body": "## Introduction\n\nRecent waves of liquidation have triggered contagion fears in the crypto market, spreading from Three Arrows Capital to crypto lenders like Celsius Network, Babel Finance, BlockFi and Voyager Digital. Billions of dollars have been wiped off the market in the past few weeks due to the collapses and the slump in digital asset prices.\n\nLiquidity issue is not only fatal to the development of DeFi but also (if not more of) such a case in NFT. In this report we will focus on NFT liquidity problems and solutions as it is seen as the major gateway to web3 given its lower threshold and more diverse use cases.\n\n## This report will cover the following topics:\n\nI. Briefly describe current liquidity problems in NFTs\n\nII. Why is there insufficient liquidity for NFTs?\n\nIII. What are the existing solutions for NFT liquidity?\n\nIV. Other thoughts for NFT liquidity solutions\n\nV. Closing thoughts\n\n## I. What are the NFT Liquidity Problems?\n\nDespite NFT’s exuberance in 2021 and early 2022, the level of NFT transaction activity can only be described as lukewarm compared to DeFi. [Top 15 NFT marketplaces](https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces) have taken up the absolute majority of the global NFT market share and yet its aggregate trading volume is sub-2% of that of [decentralized crypto exchanges](https://dune.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics), let alone centralized exchanges which [reported a whopping $14trn+](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nsav-announces-completion-major-upgrades-150900024.html#:\\~:text=Centralized%20crypto%20exchanges%20reported%20more,as%20of%20December%2024%2C%202021.) in trading volume in 2021.\n\n![Data is updated as of Jul 6, 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySnL5A7pUUeWFbipnTWIS.png?height=288&width=919)\n\nThe NFT market fluctuations contributed by the current whale centralization also adds up to the liquidity problem. Across most of Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces, 0.06% of whales (with $1mn+ NFT holding value) hold NFTs worth $5.7bn and take up 25.7% of the $22.2bn global NFT market cap [as of Jul 6, 2022](https://nftgo.io/whale-tracking/list).\n\n![Data is updated as of Jul 6, 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BzmtrW9e3LBHHO-XQb8qy.png?height=92&width=649)\n\n## II. Why is NFT Liquidity Insufficient?\n\n(1) What sets non-fungible tokens (NFTs) apart from fungible tokens is its uniqueness in rarities and utilities. While fungible token investors can easily trade tokens like Ethereum and Solana via DEXs / AMMs, the pool of buyers for each NFT sale is much smaller and hence the relatively smaller trading volume shown above. \n\n(2) NFT, despite its huge imagination with the narrative of ‘moving’ current physical assets on-chain, is still very novel to the mass market. The lack of historical data points and widely accepted valuation analysis is a key reason for the high speculation and pricing difficulty. Even NFTs within the same collection can be valued at significantly different prices due to rarity stats and subjective opinions. This leads to the low liquidity and unideal capital efficiency.\n\n(3) Similar to illiquid assets like real estates, blue-chip NFTs are listed at a high price range of US$11K-120K on average even amid the bear market. The high entry price has caused many novel investors losing their appetites, giving rise to the advocate of NFT Fractionalization, which we will discuss in the section later.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RnFVVDwFvWSq8HDCa3V3K.png?height=674&width=1156)\n\n(4) Many NFT investors are investing with a diamond hands strategy and are not willing to sell their NFTs in exchange of immediate liquidity. Hence, the development of NFT financialization is a much heated topic when it comes to resolving NFT liquidity problems.\n\n## III. Existing NFT Liquidity Scaling Solutions\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ni8Mm4sSWYskjDQuNOtkz.png?height=999&width=1456)\n\n### Category A: NFT Trading & Value-adding Protocols\n\nThe market has seen the touting of these DApps and infrastructure protocols to facilitate NFT peer-to-peer trading in a smoother and less costly way: 1) NFT marketplace aggregators, 2) price discovery tools, 3) decentralized NFT trading protocols, and 4) NFT fractionalization.\n\n#### (1) NFT marketplace aggregators \n\nNFT marketplace aggregators are likely the most notable ones among current NFT liquidity solutions. An ggregator platform consolidates NFT listings across most of NFT marketplaces and provides unprecedented visibility to NFT investors. Moreover, by allowing users to make bulk purchase it saves them gas fees by up to \\~40%. Currently, the top 3 aggregator brands are Gem ([acquired by OpenSea](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-gem-to-invest-in-pro-experience/)), Genie ([acquired by Uniswap Labs](https://uniswap.org/blog/genie)) and Flip.\n\n![Gem, Genie, Flip](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IJ08mDCguNzRSSbv8Zc1i.png?height=468&width=1456)\n\nThe recent acquisitions of [Gem](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-gem-to-invest-in-pro-experience/) and [Genie](https://uniswap.org/blog/genie) show that aggregators are an effective front-end tool for individual marketplaces / DeFi pools to gain user traffic. They also allow for lower gas fees via bulk purchases and reduce frictions for NFT buyers. But despite the hype around NFT aggregators this year, they’re fundamentally akin to Deliveroo / Booking.com in web2 as they only aggregate information like NFT listing and pricing without injecting additional liquidity into the NFT market. \n\n#### (2) Price discovery tools\n\nThis type of tools has emerged to solve the pricing difficulty and high speculation of NFTs, assisting users with their investing decisions. Furthermore, price discovery helps lay a crucial foundation for the development of NFT financialization. Unlike fungible tokens where the market prices are easily synced, NFT’s pricing is much trickier as the bid, ask and realized price can be rather inconsistent given its P2P trading feature.\n\nCurrently, there’re several price discovery methodologies:\n\n**(a) Auctions** particularly suit NFTs with high ticket values as they do in the traditional world. Opposite to the traditional English style with an ascending pricing model, Dutch auction that adopts a descending price method is widely adopted in NFT auctions where artists and auctioneers inform all potential collectors and gather all their bidding prices ahead of the auction to set the ceiling price. Then the auction will start at the ceiling price and drop by XX% for every predetermined period of time until all NFT collections get sold out at bidders’ designated bidding prices. \n\nAuctions are in favor of NFT issuers but the market capital efficiency is hugely sacrificed for an accurate pricing result, given that they lock up bidders’ capital which in aggregate mostly likely surpass the value of the NFT being bidded for.\n\n**(b) NFT oracles** like Chainlink can retrieve NFT collections’ floor prices from blockchains and compute their time weighted average prices (TWAP). This can provide investors with a reference price range by tracking the average prices.\n\nHowever, its limit is it requires a huge transaction amount for the TWAP to be accurate and for that reason it’s also susceptible to oracle attacks and market manipulations.\n\n**(c) Machine learning-driven algorithms** serve well for NFT collections with relatively abundant data points (e.g. rarity stats and traits) as it’s more effective to utilize quantitative analysis to do the price prediction.\n\nFor instance, NFTBank, an integrated NFT asset management firm, provides price discovery for \\~1,900 NFT projects. It’s powered by a machine learning model with data inputs such as NFT metadata, sales history, trait values, categories, time of sales and more.\n\nAnother example is Upshot, which has developed specialized machine learning algorithms that ingest historical sales data, secondary market data, and NFT metadata to generate reliable appraisals. Using the algorithms, Upshot reprices 270K+ top NFT items including Bored Apes, Art Blocks and CryptoPunks every hour.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ri3-203yGo4Fw2jSX73hi.png?height=502&width=764)\n\nSince ML-driven algorithms require a large amount of data points to arrive at computational results, it’s more meaningful for NFT collections with rich historical sales data, rarity stats and traits, and lower volatility. Investors may find it inaccurate for newly minted NFT projects that have less comparable traits in the market.\n\n**(d) Peer-based appraisals** include both mechanisms of 1) manual voting/recommendation and 2) behavior analysis and prediction. It’s hard to compute quantitative results for NFTs that are more subjectively priced like digital arts and thus collective judgment is probably a more reliable type of appraisal for such types.\n\nThe above-mentioned project, Upshot, also has its own NFT appraisal protocol that has established a set of data by incentivizing users to provide honest feedback and recommendations for NFT projects. It has built out the API for developers to integrate their data into various projects.\n\n#### (3) Decentralized NFT trading protocols\n\nOpenSea has announced in mid-June to migrate to Seaport Protocol, an open-source web3 marketplace protocol designed for safely and efficiently trading NFTs. OpenSea has moved one step ahead of its centralized DeFi peers by launching the protocol that features \\~35% lower gas fees, discloses on-chain transactions transparently and allows for forking by other developers.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/66x-rasPvYHxPzw_73sy4.png?height=637&width=1456)\n\nThis move lowers the threshold for developers to build their own NFT marketplaces and moves transaction data on-chain. It may remove the pain points of many existing NFT tooling platforms as they can build their own marketplaces on top of Seaport Protocol, capturing value off their existing user base who normally come to find alphas and then switch to other marketplaces/aggregators for execution.\n\nHowever, given the novelty of this protocol, whether it can actually create a liquidity network effect among the NFT tooling platforms is yet to be examined. One thing is for sure, we look to see more development in the space of permissionless NFT trading protocols.\n\n#### (4) NFT fractionalization \n\nNFT fractionalization means splitting a given NFT into multiple pieces which can be individually traded in the market. The process involves a s smart contract that divides ERC-721 tokens into a number of F-NFTs or fungible ERC-20 tokens. Since these ERC-20 tokens can be tapped into DeFi systems and valued by the market via yield farming on AMMs, it can hugely improve the price discovery and liquidity. Another more apparent reason is it encourages decentralization and democratization by allowing normal investors to gain exposure to otherwise high-value NFT items.\n\n![The splitting of a CryptoPunk NFT into 100 ERC-20 tokens](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ms6mLS4JpzGlC9uB0RAq-.png?height=282&width=600)\n\nOne of the most notable projects in this realm is fractional.art. One can connect a web3 wallet to fractional.art to purchase fractionalized NFT items which is in the form of ERC-20 tokens. As a fractionalized NFT token holder, you can participate in the vote of the NFT’s floor price. The platform has also set up a 7-day auction feature which can be triggered when an investor intends to buy up all the fractions of an NFT, i.e. to own the whole piece, so that everyone can participate in the bidding process.\n\nPartyBid, developed by PartyDAO, has an NFT auction platform that supports NFTs on several marketplaces including OpenSea. Anyone can launch a ‘Party’ to contribute ETH to collectively bid for fractions of an NFT. This is achieved via PartyBid’s MarketWrapper contract which provides a general interface to aggregate all NFT bids. PartyBid is built on fractional.art to fractionalize the NFTs that are successfully bidded. Successful bids will get charged a 2.5ETH fee and 2.5% of the token value which will be transferred to the PartyDAO’s vault.\n\n![PartyBid](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G3F-FTZBiq1eQaeY_ri-S.png?height=371&width=1282)\n\nWhile NFT fractionalization may be the next big trend given its positive impact created around democratization and liquidity, it’s not without risk. F-NFTs may give rise to regulatory issues as they are likely treated as unauthorized ICOs. SEC’s commissioner Hester Peirce warned in 2021 that F-NFTs may be considered to be securities. Additionally, managing intellectual property rights and publicity rights can be tricky and complex subject to the traits and types of NFTs.\n\n### Category B: Passive Income for Diamond-Hand NFT Investors\n\nAs we mentioned in the beginning of this report, one of the key factors that contributes to the NFT liquidity problem is investors prefer holding NFT assets and not realizing their profits. To resolve the liquidity issues derived from this behavior, 3 main measures mirrored from existing traditional finance world are aiming to serve these long-term NFT investors: 1) NFT-backed loans/ Collateralized Loan Positions (CDPs), 2) NFT liquidity pools and 3) NFT renting/lending.\n\nBoth of them provide passive income streams and improve capital efficiency for NFT investors while supplying extra liquidity to the market. Also note that many platforms under this category have incorporated the solutions under Category A since they serve for these 2 types of measures in various ways.\n\n#### (1) NFT-backed loans / CDPs\n\nAs compared to the global fine art market where the debt penetration is \\~35% ($24bn/$65bn), NFT debt penetration is only 0.5% (\\~$250mn/$37bn) as of May 1st, 2022 and hence is expected to boost the liquidity as the total market size grows.\n\nThere’re 2 types of loan issuers: peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-protocol (P2Protocol). The majority of loans are issued through P2P loan platforms such as NFTFi and Arcade. The rest are issued by P2Pool loan suppliers such as BendDAO, DropsDAO, PineDAO, Goblin Sax and etc.\n\nCurrent total addressable market for NFT-backed loans is over $250mn by loan volumes. With a higher volatility, NFTs loan lenders can get higher expected returns than traditional crypto-backed loans.\n\n**a) P2P NFT-backed lending platforms**. The two largest players in this space are NFTFi and Arcade, of which the aggregate loans issued to date has amounted to \\~$240mn. Currently, only blue-chip NFTs are supported on these P2P platforms given the high volatility and uncertainty in other long-tail NFT items.\n\nNFTFi is built on top of the NFT lending protocol, MetaStreet. It allows NFT owners to borrow wETH or DAI using their NFTs as collaterals and lenders get to earn interests by supplying these loans. NFTFi’s 90-day loans require an APR up to 1,000%  while longer-duration loans’ average at \\~90%. The company has handled a loan volume of [$217mn ](https://dune.com/rchen8/NFTfi)across 13,363 loans since its May-2020 inception (as of Jul 5, 2022). NFTFi charges 5% on lender’s interest revenue upon successful loans (excluding defaulted ones). Some of the collatealized NFT include wrapped Crypto Punks (\\~29% of loans) and BAYC (23% of loans).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sJB-Fpf2ooUJg6cGfVosO.png?height=599&width=1300)\n\nArcade ($20mn) is built on the Pawn protocol and has facilitated \\~$20mn loans since inception in 2022. Other than wETH and DAI, users can also borrow USDC by collateralizing NFTs from the selected [list](https://contracts.arcade.xyz/). Unlike NFTFi, Arcade charges borrowers a fixed 2% of principal upfront when the loan is originated.\n\nNeither of the above P2P lending platforms underwrites any risk and does not rely on algorithmic pricing to scale. However, the scalability is limited by its bespoke loan terms and potentially slower matching as borrowers must wait for counteroffers. \n\n**b) P2Protocol NFT-backed loans**\n\nThe size of P2Protocol lending market is still small ($30mn-$50mn). Major players include BendDAO, Drops, Pine, Goblin Sax, JPEG’d and Defrag. Some lending platforms, e.g. BendDAO, adopt vote-escrow tokenomics to incentivize NFT holders to supply liquidity in various loan pools. Similar to DeFi liquidity pools, they emit governance tokens to boost interest rates for lenders.\n\nTo resolve P2P lending marketplaces’ slow matching issue, P2Protocol lending projects allow for instantaneous time-to-liquidity as the matching process is handled by the protocol. But the downside is automating loan terms requires rich data points such as real-time prices and rarity stats, and hence limiting the NFT selections to the already liquid ones with quantitative properties.\n\nEven with the over-collateralization (50% at least) for NFT-backed loans, NFT-backed lenders still assume a bigger risk than traditional crypto asset-backed loan providers due to a higher possibility of “voluntary” defaults. This happens if borrowers give up on repaying loans when the value of NFT is less than loan amount. To mitigate such risks, accurate price discovery, credit risk analysis and insurance are all crucial value-added services that many lending platforms have integrated or are actively exploring.\n\nInspired by NFT marketplace aggregators, NFT-backed loan aggregators and infrastructures may be on the next trend as NFT lending marketplaces are still fragmented (esp. in P2Protocol). Apart from [MetaStreet](https://metastreet.xyz/) mentioned above, Spice Finance is a newer project that aims to consolidate existing P2Protocol loans onto one single platform by integrating various NFT P2Protocol protocols. On top of that it has built out a machine-learning NFT appraisal tool and credit risk system to underpin the integrated loan platform.\n\nThe biggest risk for such aggregators comes from the high level of integration and composability as the projects inherit the risks of all the underlying applications.\n\n### (2) NFT liquidity pools\n\nNFT liquidity pools can be categorized into staking liquidity pools and trading liquidity pools, which are mirrored from [DeFi liquidity pools](https://www.huobi.com/learn/en-us/what-are-liquidity-pools/). The main variation is users can mint fungible tokens (e.g. ERC-20 tokens) by depositing NFTs of similar traits/floor prices into the same liquidity pool. The fungible tokens are a representation of and can be swapped for any random assets in the pool. Liquidity providers can enjoy faster time-to-liquidity by depositing NFTs, minting corresponding fungible tokens and swapping them easily via DeFi AMMs (e.g. Sushiswap if using NFTX). Apart from NFTX, another key platform is [NFT20](https://nft20.io/). As liquidity pools involve the minting of fungible tokens, this types of services is often times powered by NFT fractionalization protocols.\n\nSame as DeFi, users can arbitrage out an NFT if it’s mispriced and hence facilitate the price discovery. Additionally, liquidity providers usually get LP tokens and can stake them for boosted rewards. Given NFT’s higher volatility and speculation, however, the risk of slippage may be a challenge for both platforms and investors to handle.\n\n### (3) NFT renting \n\nRenting provides another direction for NFT owners to generate passive income. Double Protocol’s ERC-4907 standard has just become the 30th official ERC standard on Ethereum, which takes an innovative approach by adding an ‘expires’ feature that authorizes automatic expiration for the ‘user’. In this way, projects that are built upon ERC-4907 standard can easily segregate users’ ownership from the right of use that will automatically cease upon the end of the renting period. This will fuel up the development of NFT renting and give rise to more derivatives built around it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/za6apYezbkD4dgOQkMS8X.png?height=675&width=1200)\n\nNFT renting can be applicable to a variety of use cases including gaming, art, PFP, membership NFTs and so on. For example, art exhibitions, brands or events may rent out specific digital art NFTs that match with their pop-up shows/events. Or someone who want to join a community for a period of time before making a long-term commitment may rent out a membership NFT for one month (sounds like subscription to paid contents).\n\nThe most promising use case for NFT renting is gaming given the imagination of the size of metaverse. Virtual lands may drive up some hypes as many owners invested in a large amount of lands so that they can count on them to generate passive rental income from different types of uses as the game onboards more users and brands. Furthermore, in-game assets such as skins, gears,  pets, characters and other items are either required to play the game or granting advantages to players. You may find an example from my [article](https://cmsdaisy.medium.com/will-defi-kingdoms-be-the-mega-blockchain-game-in-the-long-term-ddab85d4a650) about how players rent out the Hero characters in the game. In cases where players can’t afford or simply don’t want to buy in-game NFTs due of all sorts of reasons, they will opt for renting, boosting NFT liquidity further.\n\n## IV. Other Thoughts for NFT Liquidity Solutions\n\nWhen it comes to NFT trading, what can drive liquidity further seems to come from communities where users are aligned on tastes and values for the NFT projects that grow out of the community. Often times, the marketplace is a vertical one which is decided by the theme / vibe of the community behind. Such an NFT marketplace is great for NFT projects to exert the tokens’ influence and utilities among community members. Project owners will also have this sense of belongingness and ownership as they can take part in the voting of marketplace design to deliver certain user experience. \n\nDAOs sound like an organic place for such a marketplace to develop especially with the aforementioned Seaport Protocol that lowers the threshold of developing. Additionally, centralized NFT marketplaces are also actively exploring the community features, such as [Coinbase’s beta version](https://nft.coinbase.com/) of its NFT marketplace has a focus on creating a social community for both buyers and sellers.\n\n## V. Closing Thoughts\n\nAll the above liquidity solutions are trying to resolve issues based on the current NFT market size. What drives NFT liquidity fundamentally in the long term will have to come from its own penetration in various industries. \n\nWe are on an exciting journey into the future of NFTs, where we’ve seen prestigious businesses and celebrities from sports, fashion brands, music streaming services and education forming their partnerships with metaverse-like projects and blockchain technologies. The ultimate way to boost the NFT liquidity is through mass adoption. Along the journey of NFT financialization and further adoption, NFT trading platforms are likely to be made subject to more stringent regulations regarding anti-money laundering and security investments.\n\nFasten your seat belt and stay tuned.", "timestamp": 1658146209, "digest": "fy5xHf5GTFEFDqUWIO0ZZAFVG61D6g5yYdWCRLpVDgA", "contributor": "0x520E805E3C91c5A047C67e589476884587978Fd1"}
{"id": "c-z9oSv4OvOuTRCYZzXv7jhM1wpOleE2Hb91faiiTX8", "title": "Analysis on NFT Liquidity: Problems & Solutions", "body": "## Introduction\n\nRecent waves of liquidation have triggered contagion fears in the crypto market, spreading from Three Arrows Capital to crypto lenders like Celsius Network, Babel Finance, BlockFi and Voyager Digital. Billions of dollars have been wiped off the market in the past few weeks due to the collapses and the slump in digital asset prices.\n\nLiquidity issue is not only fatal to the development of DeFi but also (if not more of) such a case in NFT. In this report we will focus on NFT liquidity problems and solutions as it is seen as the major gateway to web3 given its lower threshold and more diverse use cases.\n\n## This report will cover the following topics:\n\nI. Briefly describe current liquidity problems in NFTs\n\nII. Why is there insufficient liquidity for NFTs?\n\nIII. What are the existing solutions for NFT liquidity?\n\nIV. Other thoughts for NFT liquidity solutions\n\nV. Closing thoughts\n\n## I. What are the NFT Liquidity Problems?\n\nDespite NFT’s exuberance in 2021 and early 2022, the level of NFT transaction activity can only be described as lukewarm compared to DeFi. [Top 15 NFT marketplaces](https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces) have taken up the absolute majority of the global NFT market share and yet its aggregate trading volume is sub-2% of that of [decentralized crypto exchanges](https://dune.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics), let alone centralized exchanges which [reported a whopping $14trn+](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nsav-announces-completion-major-upgrades-150900024.html#:\\~:text=Centralized%20crypto%20exchanges%20reported%20more,as%20of%20December%2024%2C%202021.) in trading volume in 2021.\n\n![Data is updated as of Jul 6, 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySnL5A7pUUeWFbipnTWIS.png?height=288&width=919)\n\nThe NFT market fluctuations contributed by the current whale centralization also adds up to the liquidity problem. Across most of Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces, 0.06% of whales (with $1mn+ NFT holding value) hold NFTs worth $5.7bn and take up 25.7% of the $22.2bn global NFT market cap [as of Jul 6, 2022](https://nftgo.io/whale-tracking/list).\n\n![Data is updated as of Jul 6, 2022](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BzmtrW9e3LBHHO-XQb8qy.png?height=92&width=649)\n\n## II. Why is NFT Liquidity Insufficient?\n\n(1) What sets non-fungible tokens (NFTs) apart from fungible tokens is its uniqueness in rarities and utilities. While fungible token investors can easily trade tokens like Ethereum and Solana via DEXs / AMMs, the pool of buyers for each NFT sale is much smaller and hence the relatively smaller trading volume shown above. \n\n(2) NFT, despite its huge imagination with the narrative of ‘moving’ current physical assets on-chain, is still very novel to the mass market. The lack of historical data points and widely accepted valuation analysis is a key reason for the high speculation and pricing difficulty. Even NFTs within the same collection can be valued at significantly different prices due to rarity stats and subjective opinions. This leads to the low liquidity and unideal capital efficiency.\n\n(3) Similar to illiquid assets like real estates, blue-chip NFTs are listed at a high price range of US$11K-120K on average even amid the bear market. The high entry price has caused many novel investors losing their appetites, giving rise to the advocate of NFT Fractionalization, which we will discuss in the section later.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RnFVVDwFvWSq8HDCa3V3K.png?height=674&width=1156)\n\n(4) Many NFT investors are investing with a diamond hands strategy and are not willing to sell their NFTs in exchange of immediate liquidity. Hence, the development of NFT financialization is a much heated topic when it comes to resolving NFT liquidity problems.\n\n## III. Existing NFT Liquidity Scaling Solutions\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ni8Mm4sSWYskjDQuNOtkz.png?height=999&width=1456)\n\n### Category A: NFT Trading & Value-adding Protocols\n\nThe market has seen the touting of these DApps and infrastructure protocols to facilitate NFT peer-to-peer trading in a smoother and less costly way: 1) NFT marketplace aggregators, 2) price discovery tools, 3) decentralized NFT trading protocols, and 4) NFT fractionalization.\n\n#### (1) NFT marketplace aggregators \n\nNFT marketplace aggregators are likely the most notable ones among current NFT liquidity solutions. An ggregator platform consolidates NFT listings across most of NFT marketplaces and provides unprecedented visibility to NFT investors. Moreover, by allowing users to make bulk purchase it saves them gas fees by up to \\~40%. Currently, the top 3 aggregator brands are Gem ([acquired by OpenSea](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-gem-to-invest-in-pro-experience/)), Genie ([acquired by Uniswap Labs](https://uniswap.org/blog/genie)) and Flip.\n\n![Gem, Genie, Flip](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IJ08mDCguNzRSSbv8Zc1i.png?height=468&width=1456)\n\nThe recent acquisitions of [Gem](https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-gem-to-invest-in-pro-experience/) and [Genie](https://uniswap.org/blog/genie) show that aggregators are an effective front-end tool for individual marketplaces / DeFi pools to gain user traffic. They also allow for lower gas fees via bulk purchases and reduce frictions for NFT buyers. But despite the hype around NFT aggregators this year, they’re fundamentally akin to Deliveroo / Booking.com in web2 as they only aggregate information like NFT listing and pricing without injecting additional liquidity into the NFT market. \n\n#### (2) Price discovery tools\n\nThis type of tools has emerged to solve the pricing difficulty and high speculation of NFTs, assisting users with their investing decisions. Furthermore, price discovery helps lay a crucial foundation for the development of NFT financialization. Unlike fungible tokens where the market prices are easily synced, NFT’s pricing is much trickier as the bid, ask and realized price can be rather inconsistent given its P2P trading feature.\n\nCurrently, there’re several price discovery methodologies:\n\n**(a) Auctions** particularly suit NFTs with high ticket values as they do in the traditional world. Opposite to the traditional English style with an ascending pricing model, Dutch auction that adopts a descending price method is widely adopted in NFT auctions where artists and auctioneers inform all potential collectors and gather all their bidding prices ahead of the auction to set the ceiling price. Then the auction will start at the ceiling price and drop by XX% for every predetermined period of time until all NFT collections get sold out at bidders’ designated bidding prices. \n\nAuctions are in favor of NFT issuers but the market capital efficiency is hugely sacrificed for an accurate pricing result, given that they lock up bidders’ capital which in aggregate mostly likely surpass the value of the NFT being bidded for.\n\n**(b) NFT oracles** like Chainlink can retrieve NFT collections’ floor prices from blockchains and compute their time weighted average prices (TWAP). This can provide investors with a reference price range by tracking the average prices.\n\nHowever, its limit is it requires a huge transaction amount for the TWAP to be accurate and for that reason it’s also susceptible to oracle attacks and market manipulations.\n\n**(c) Machine learning-driven algorithms** serve well for NFT collections with relatively abundant data points (e.g. rarity stats and traits) as it’s more effective to utilize quantitative analysis to do the price prediction.\n\nFor instance, NFTBank, an integrated NFT asset management firm, provides price discovery for \\~1,900 NFT projects. It’s powered by a machine learning model with data inputs such as NFT metadata, sales history, trait values, categories, time of sales and more.\n\nAnother example is Upshot, which has developed specialized machine learning algorithms that ingest historical sales data, secondary market data, and NFT metadata to generate reliable appraisals. Using the algorithms, Upshot reprices 270K+ top NFT items including Bored Apes, Art Blocks and CryptoPunks every hour.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ri3-203yGo4Fw2jSX73hi.png?height=502&width=764)\n\nSince ML-driven algorithms require a large amount of data points to arrive at computational results, it’s more meaningful for NFT collections with rich historical sales data, rarity stats and traits, and lower volatility. Investors may find it inaccurate for newly minted NFT projects that have less comparable traits in the market.\n\n**(d) Peer-based appraisals** include both mechanisms of 1) manual voting/recommendation and 2) behavior analysis and prediction. It’s hard to compute quantitative results for NFTs that are more subjectively priced like digital arts and thus collective judgment is probably a more reliable type of appraisal for such types.\n\nThe above-mentioned project, Upshot, also has its own NFT appraisal protocol that has established a set of data by incentivizing users to provide honest feedback and recommendations for NFT projects. It has built out the API for developers to integrate their data into various projects.\n\n#### (3) Decentralized NFT trading protocols\n\nOpenSea has announced in mid-June to migrate to Seaport Protocol, an open-source web3 marketplace protocol designed for safely and efficiently trading NFTs. OpenSea has moved one step ahead of its centralized DeFi peers by launching the protocol that features \\~35% lower gas fees, discloses on-chain transactions transparently and allows for forking by other developers.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/66x-rasPvYHxPzw_73sy4.png?height=637&width=1456)\n\nThis move lowers the threshold for developers to build their own NFT marketplaces and moves transaction data on-chain. It may remove the pain points of many existing NFT tooling platforms as they can build their own marketplaces on top of Seaport Protocol, capturing value off their existing user base who normally come to find alphas and then switch to other marketplaces/aggregators for execution.\n\nHowever, given the novelty of this protocol, whether it can actually create a liquidity network effect among the NFT tooling platforms is yet to be examined. One thing is for sure, we look to see more development in the space of permissionless NFT trading protocols.\n\n#### (4) NFT fractionalization \n\nNFT fractionalization means splitting a given NFT into multiple pieces which can be individually traded in the market. The process involves a s smart contract that divides ERC-721 tokens into a number of F-NFTs or fungible ERC-20 tokens. Since these ERC-20 tokens can be tapped into DeFi systems and valued by the market via yield farming on AMMs, it can hugely improve the price discovery and liquidity. Another more apparent reason is it encourages decentralization and democratization by allowing normal investors to gain exposure to otherwise high-value NFT items.\n\n![The splitting of a CryptoPunk NFT into 100 ERC-20 tokens](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ms6mLS4JpzGlC9uB0RAq-.png?height=282&width=600)\n\nOne of the most notable projects in this realm is fractional.art.

F-NFTs may give rise to regulatory issues as they are likely treated as unauthorized ICOs. SEC’s commissioner Hester Peirce warned in 2021 that F-NFTs may be considered to be securities.

To resolve the liquidity issues derived from this behavior, 3 main measures mirrored from existing traditional finance world are aiming to serve these long-term NFT investors: 1) NFT-backed loans/ Collateralized Loan Positions (CDPs), 2) NFT liquidity pools and 3) NFT renting/lending.\n\nBoth of them provide passive income streams and improve capital efficiency for NFT investors while supplying extra liquidity to the market.

Liquidity providers can enjoy faster time-to-liquidity by depositing NFTs, minting corresponding fungible tokens and swapping them easily via DeFi AMMs (e.g. Sushiswap if using NFTX). Apart from NFTX, another key platform is [NFT20](https://nft20.io/). As liquidity pools involve the minting of fungible tokens, this types of services is often times powered by NFT fractionalization protocols.\n\nSame as DeFi, users can arbitrage out an NFT if it’s mispriced and hence facilitate the price discovery. Additionally, liquidity providers usually get LP tokens and can stake them for boosted rewards. Given NFT’s higher volatility and speculation, however, the risk of slippage may be a challenge for both platforms and investors to handle.\n\n### (3) NFT renting \n\nRenting provides another direction for NFT owners to generate passive income. Double Protocol’s ERC-4907 standard has just become the 30th official ERC standard on Ethereum, which takes an innovative approach by adding an ‘expires’ feature that authorizes automatic expiration for the ‘user’. In this way, projects that are built upon ERC-4907 standard can easily segregate users’ ownership from the right of use that will automatically cease upon the end of the renting period. This will fuel up the development of NFT renting and give rise to more derivatives built around it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/za6apYezbkD4dgOQkMS8X.png?height=675&width=1200)\n\nNFT renting can be applicable to a variety of use cases including gaming, art, PFP, membership NFTs and so on. For example, art exhibitions, brands or events may rent out specific digital art NFTs that match with their pop-up shows/events. Or someone who want to join a community for a period of time before making a long-term commitment may rent out a membership NFT for one month (sounds like subscription to paid contents).\n\nThe most promising use case for NFT renting is gaming given the imagination of the size of metaverse. Virtual lands may drive up some hypes as many owners invested in a large amount of lands so that they can count on them to generate passive rental income from different types of uses as the game onboards more users and brands. Furthermore, in-game assets such as skins, gears,  pets, characters and other items are either required to play the game or granting advantages to players. You may find an example from my [article](https://cmsdaisy.medium.com/will-defi-kingdoms-be-the-mega-blockchain-game-in-the-long-term-ddab85d4a650) about how players rent out the Hero characters in the game. In cases where players can’t afford or simply don’t want to buy in-game NFTs due of all sorts of reasons, they will opt for renting, boosting NFT liquidity further.\n\n## IV. Other Thoughts for NFT Liquidity Solutions\n\nWhen it comes to NFT trading, what can drive liquidity further seems to come from communities where users are aligned on tastes and values for the NFT projects that grow out of the community. Often times, the marketplace is a vertical one which is decided by the theme / vibe of the community behind. Such an NFT marketplace is great for NFT projects to exert the tokens’ influence and utilities among community members. Project owners will also have this sense of belongingness and ownership as they can take part in the voting of marketplace design to deliver certain user experience. \n\nDAOs sound like an organic place for such a marketplace to develop especially with the aforementioned Seaport Protocol that lowers the threshold of developing. Additionally, centralized NFT marketplaces are also actively exploring the community features, such as [Coinbase’s beta version](https://nft.coinbase.com/) of its NFT marketplace has a focus on creating a social community for both buyers and sellers.\n\n## V. Closing Thoughts\n\nAll the above liquidity solutions are trying to resolve issues based on the current NFT market size. What drives NFT liquidity fundamentally in the long term will have to come from its own penetration in various industries. \n\nWe are on an exciting journey into the future of NFTs, where we’ve seen prestigious businesses and celebrities from sports, fashion brands, music streaming services and education forming their partnerships with metaverse-like projects and blockchain technologies. The ultimate way to boost the NFT liquidity is through mass adoption. Along the journey of NFT financialization and further adoption, NFT trading platforms are likely to be made subject to more stringent regulations regarding anti-money laundering and security investments.\n\nFasten your seat belt and stay tuned.", "timestamp": 1658146281, "digest": "mEb-WR_p-i-rh-mJrsnMEc8AlUIcR0zgBv4tAGLncYw", "contributor": "0x520E805E3C91c5A047C67e589476884587978Fd1"}

\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9EbW9kSNtG7Fb9m-pawHd.png?height=383&width=900)\n\nArianna Simpson 是科技、游戏和加密货币顶尖风投公司a16z(全称：Andreessen Horowitz)的普通合伙人，她参与投资了各种加密货币和游戏公司，包括Irreverent Labs。她相信区块链技术带来的去中心化的力量，也相信这将引领我们走向元宇宙。\n\na16z拥有6亿美元的专门游戏基金和45亿美元的加密货币基金。Simpson 正在部署这笔资金，但我们也正处于加密货币的低迷时期，以及面临着硬核玩家对NFT的抵制。这让这家公司的风险比几个月前要大得多。在接受GamesBeat的采访时，Simpson 表示a16z准备从长远角度看待这个市场。\n\nGameBeat对Simpson进行了深度专访，探讨了加密货币和游戏的交叉点，她对接受NFT的玩家的看法，为什么玩家应该分享游戏收益，以及为什么a16z的创始人Marc Andreessen和Ben Horowitz看到了这个领域的机会，并向这个领域的特定基金投入了双倍的资金。尽管市场经历了多次过山车式的循环，但这种信念并未改变。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8UskTLlP-s2RPwvcZsc5k.png?height=921&width=640)\n\n*采访对象：顶尖风投公司a16z的普通合伙人 Arianna Simpson \n *以下是此次访谈的文字内容。 \n 提问：你是什么时候开始对这个领域感兴趣的？你是如何发现加密货币和游戏之间的联系的?\n\nSimpson：大约十年前，我掉进了加密货币的兔子洞。我第一次感兴趣是在2013年，当时我在非洲南部旅行。我在六个国家待过一段时间，包括津巴布韦。我目睹了他们经历的恶性通货膨胀的后果。显然，这破坏了经济，迫使他们转向美元以稳定经济。这迫使他们采取激进的措施。\n\n当我回到美国时，我和一个朋友谈到了这个问题，他提到比特币是通货紧缩的，而不是可能过度膨胀的东西。这让我走了很远的路。显然，现在的比特币市场已经远远超出了比特币的范畴。但这只是最初的催化剂。我越深入，就越觉得有趣。这是一个非常丰富的设计空间，汇集了很多领域，从密码学到博弈论到计算机科学等等。\n\n游戏领域是我的基金的核心内容之一。在我加入a16z之前，我创办了一家名为Autonomous Partners的基金。我已经对游戏领域非常感兴趣了。我在这一领域进行了许多投资，包括Mythical和Flow区块链。我联系了Dapper实验室的团队。他们将NFT理念作为游戏体验的一部分，这是值得称赞的，当然，许多其他团队也采用并扩展了这一理念。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m1Xf9tv__KZJo6lasaGIs.png?height=511&width=1080)\n\n我已经深入研究NFT和游戏领域很长时间。看到它们真正开始吸引主流关注，真是令人难以置信。这是2021年的现象。我很期待我们接下来的发展。事实上，我们还只是触及了表面。我们认为web3游戏是一种巨大的催化剂，能够将数千万乃至数亿人带入web3领域。Web3游戏完全可以这样。游戏环境通常会引领技术的发展趋势。我们已经见过很多次了。能够让人们在一个低风险的环境中参与进来，并教育他们为了在这个生态系统中茁壮成长而需要学习的原则，这是非常令人兴奋的。我仍然对这一领域的未来充满期待。\n\n*加密货币价格暴跌*\n\n提问：我知道a16z也有早期的加密货币投资背景，但在某种程度上，像这样一家大型风险投资公司会进入加密货币这样的领域，你会感到惊讶吗？他们是如何推断出这是应该关注的事情的?\n\nSimpson：这家公司，尤其是Mark (Andreessen)和Ben (Horowitz)，值得高度赞扬，因为他们愿意承担在当时看来非常巨大的风险，完全投入到这个领域。在那个时候大多数风投同行都没有这么做。我想加入a16z的原因之一是，这个公司愿意建立专门的独立基金，果断押注自己认定的领域。我并不是在找工作，但这确实让他们比大多数风投同行更突出。\n\n我认为，这家公司多年来对这个领域的信心在大型风投平台中是独一无二的。这让我们能够与最好的创始人合作。创始人希望知道他们的投资者对这个领域有信心。他们不会因为某一天市场的变化而在某一领域中徘徊。Mark、Ben和Chris很早就看到了。这就是我想加入并成为其中一员的原因。\n\n提问：就它最初的吸引力而言，是围绕去中心化的争论，还是其他事情，吸引你们去投资新的想法？\n\nSimpson：在我们的行业中，某种程度上，我们是被动的。我们必须关注伟大的企业家的发展方向。即使在早期，也需要这样。Coinbase的Brian Armstrong，以及其他很多人。即便如此，虽然这是一个很新颖的领域，但你有非常优秀的创始人，他们对这项技术非常感兴趣。同样，我们的投资雷达在某种程度上是受论文驱动的，但也非常受人才驱动。创始人、顶级创始人，在选择加密领域时，我们一直认为这是需要考虑的关键问题。 \n\n提问：你是否经历了两次加密货币寒冬？你经历了多少个寒冬，就加密货币的整体发展而言，你如何看待它们?\n\nSimpson：**周期的长度肯定会随着时间的推移而增加。**早在2013年，一年之内就出现了多个周期。然后，时间轴向外延伸。最重要的一点是专注于技术，而不是过于关注周期。我们已经看到，许多最好的企业——在更广泛的技术领域和加密或具体的web3领域都是如此——都是在市场不稳定时期开始的。我们认为这是一个专注于技术的机会。加密货币面临的挑战之一是有一个报价器，这是早期初创公司所没有的。这会让人分心。但在现实中，在价格活动减弱的时期，可能是专注于建设的绝佳机会。\n\n如果我把我们现在的状况与2018年的衰退相比，就实际建造的东西而言，我们处于一个完全不同的世界。在2018年，很多事情正在进行中，很多Layer 1区块链正在建设，很多基础设施正在建设，远远超过应用程序。基础设施必须放在第一位。在这个领域中，一个人能做的事情还不多。今日不同往日，许多协议已经启动。成百上千的应用程序已经实时可用。游戏，钱包，各种各样的东西。在我看来，这才是最重要的进步。我们已经看到了巨大的进步。\n\n我们还发布了一份加密货币报告，你可能已经看到了。我们用数据绘制出了这个周期的各个部分。虽然它们看起来像是混乱的波动周期，但实际上它们是非常可预测的。周期的每个部分都有其特定的作用，尤其是价格上行的时期吸引人们进入这个领域。热情的投资者蜂拥而至。当潮水退去时，一些人离开了，但他们可能不是建造者。他们可能是投机者。许多核心人才留在了这个领域。这让我们能够为下一波建设做好准备，最终随着创造更多价值，价格会升值。但是周期非常重要。最重要的是专注于技术的开发，显然，这不是一朝一夕就能实现的。\n\n![区块链游戏中的数字土地销售：加密货币寒冬已经开始影响价格升值](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V2Id1WTcP-qQNLkq05UGh.png?height=669&width=1080)\n\n提问：很有趣的是，你可以看到你对即将进入这个领域的开发者有信心。他们要么有加密的背景，要么有游戏的背景。这是值得赌一把的好东西。如果这个领域有什么不确定的地方，这些伟大的团队，经验丰富的人才，似乎值得我们押注。游戏领域的人意识到这是他们想要进入的领域，你是什么时候开始看到这种情况发生的？\n\nSimpson：这波浪潮在2021年真正升温。在此之前，已经有一些来自传统游戏背景的创始人对NFT和web3游戏表示了兴趣。但就真正开始达到临界量而言，是2021年初。我们已经看到它从哪里开始回升。绘制人才迁移的地图是非常令人兴奋的。虽然还不是游戏产业中的所有人，但表示有兴趣或已经积极在游戏中构建Web3组件的创始人的比例显著增加。再次强调，我们认为这是一个值得关注的重要趋势。从那以后，我们一直在投资这些团队。\n\n提问：我认为这将给其他行业带来压力，这很有趣。大公司的首席执行官们面临着压力，他们会说:“不要离开，我们也会探索这个领域。”当我在动视暴雪采访Bobby Kotick时，他表示他们将公司出售给微软的原因之一是他们很难找到人才，留住人才，并为他们承诺制作的游戏雇佣数千名所需人员。有趣的是，这种特殊的区块链游戏趋势可能会卷土重来，并影响主流游戏。\n\nSimpson：是的。我们认为整个游戏理念将对传统游戏实体产生重大影响，无论是发行商还是大型游戏开发商。在这一点上，秘密已经泄露了。我们认为玩家应该抓住他们创造的一些价值。虽然这些模型还需要进行一些迭代，我们还没有达到完美的架构，但核心理念，即创造了这些世界和社区并创造了这么多价值的玩家应该分享这些价值，我们认为这是一个非常重要的理念。\n\n现在，随着玩家越来越熟悉这一事实，这是一种新的模式，我们认为这将给游戏世界中更传统的实体带来巨大的压力，使其采用更有利的模式。它们不会都有相同的模型。这可以有很多形式。但这个核心理念是至关重要的。\n\n提问：我现在感到困惑和疑惑的一个领域是，谁是游戏玩家？在整个2021年，我一直在想区块链游戏将成为元宇宙的垫脚石。你可以将所有这些技术用于资产的身份和互操作性，这些都是创建元宇宙的必要成分。但在12月，我们遇到了玩家反对育碧在《彩虹六号》中的NFT的问题。他们也开始反对其他面向传统玩家的NFT游戏。\n\n那么，谁喜欢NFT，谁讨厌它们呢？亚洲人似乎接受了某些市场的实验，就像他们在免费游戏中所做的一样，而西方的传统玩家和硬核玩家却觉得免费游戏背叛了他们。他们觉得战利品箱就是其中的全部内容。我观察了整个市场，发现免费游戏占据了游戏市场的一半以上。它渗透到游戏的每一个环节，从手机到主机，我们的玩家数量是过去的10倍。对我来说，这些都是好东西。但对于这部分人来说，他们认为免费游戏和区块链游戏是邪恶的东西。\n\n奇怪的是，菲律宾人首先接受了“边玩赚边”的游戏模式。我不知道喜欢这种游戏的玩家和不喜欢这种游戏的玩家谁的占比更高。但我可以看出，如果现在的玩家具有接受它的主流特征，那么NFT游戏成为主流只是时间问题。但如果这些游戏玩家有一些怪癖的话——他们是想通过把钱投入NFT来避税的加密狂人——这里有一些特定的行为是一个小群体的，而不是主流的——也许它永远不会成为主流。如果只是那些在虚拟世界中花1万美元购买一块土地的人，那么这种活动就不会成为主流。\n\n也就是说，你认为现在的受众对这个感兴趣的是什么？什么样的受众可以起飞，并成长为数百万甚至数千万NFT游戏用户？\n\nSimpson： 你提出了一个很好的观点，即**新形式元素**，新模式通常不会被硬核游戏社区所接受。正如你所指出的，这方面有很多先例。但这并没有阻止某些模式获得更大的规模，例如免费游戏。我认为这列火车正驶向车站，它不会真的在这里停下来。\n\n有一群人非常直言不讳地表达了对NFT的保留意见，在很多情况下，他们的批评都是毫无根据的。他们要么没有完全理解这些问题，要么只是用一种非常偏斜的视角来看待问题。但他们只是少数。有很多人已经开始看到这种模式的好处并拥抱它。我不认为这是一个只有非常神秘的原住民的小宇宙。事实上，Axie Infinity是最先成为主流游戏的Web3游戏。它们吸引了数百万玩家。这不仅仅是几个加密货币内部人士。他们拥有巨大的规模，而且他们的大多数玩家都是加密货币的新手。 \n\n这表明，虽然我们还有很大的发展空间，但我们的方向是正确的。游戏是将人们带入这个领域的工具，而不是仅仅吸引一小部分人的自我参照。当然也有讨厌Web3的人，但我认为最重要的是，有数百万人已经表现出对Web3游戏的强烈兴趣。这是我们的重点，也是我们的投资组合公司的重点。\n\n提问：讨论中有趣的部分是，一些游戏开发者继续抵制。他们的论点有时更具技术性。每个人都说这是关于去中心化的，但为什么这里涉及这么多中心化的实体，比如OpenSea？如果OpenSea倒闭，90%的NFT将变得毫无价值。如果你与游戏开发者进行此类讨论，并且需要说服他们，那么这种讨论将如何进行？\n\nSimpson：**我们接触到的大多数创始人都对Web3感到兴奋。**显然，我是加密团队的一员，所以在他们找到我之前，会有一种过滤器。但总的来说，我们已经看到了对这种新模式非常开放的思想和尝试的意愿。游戏是测试新技术和迭代的理想场所，尽管玩家社区的某些子部门可能更不愿意改变。许多之前制作过游戏的Web 2.0创始人都看到了这里的潜力，这也是他们进入这个领域的原因。\n\n我曾与许多在加入web3之前创造过大型游戏的创始人进行过交谈，现在他们会说:“这是最明显的答案。我想不出别的了。这很有意义。这解决了很多问题。”拥有拥有自己的资产的能力—-虽然如果OpenSea消失了，这可能会短暂地影响市场，但事实上我仍然控制着我的剑或我所拥有的任何NFT资产，不管发生什么，因为我拥有链上的钥匙，这是一个重要的转变。许多精明的游戏创始人都明白这一点。这是他们进入这个领域的原因之一。\n\n提问：至于那些可能超出企业家控制范围的事情，比如美国的监管，或允许或不允许的事情，无论是被归类为证券或赌博，还是公司只是不想放弃他们的一些收入流——你认为我们会到达一个比现在更自由的区块链游戏公司的市场吗?\n\nSimpson：当然还有一些监管的灰色地带。在我们的创始人身上，我们看到他们想要合规。他们在寻找可以遵循的明确规则。这就是为什么我们建立了一个庞大的监管团队，与政策制定者合作，帮助他们跟上进度。我们整天都在思考这个领域。他们有许多考虑。只是帮助他们思考这个领域的细微差别。Web3游戏不需要像DeFi协议或其他完全属于这个领域的东西那样的规则。我们要找的是细致入微的监管，做出适当的区分，并适用于他们试图监管的事情。\n\n在我们看来，**监管至关重要。**我们欢迎监管。从消费者保护的角度来看，这是非常重要的。但它需要有意义。这就是为什么我们建立了一个庞大的团队，并花费大量时间在华盛顿特区与监管机构和政策制定者就这些问题进行合作。\n\n提问：我不知道你是否同意这一观点，但我想知道大型游戏公司是否会在这个市场上处于劣势。这与他们的公众地位有关。他们担心规章制度。他们会等待明确的信号，然后才会迅速行动。然而，有些初创公司的价值正在迅速上升，以至于它们将超越大型游戏公司。大型公司通常的解决方案是，谁赢就收购谁。但在手机游戏领域，像Supercell这样的开发商几乎大到无人问津。腾讯几乎是唯一的可能。但手机游戏市场的赢家并不是像Electronic Arts这样的公司。那些能够快速行动且不担心监管的初创公司才是免费游戏的赢家。在我看来，我们现在在区块链游戏中也有同样的机会。\n\nSimpson：肯定是的。正如你所描述的，我们投资了很多这样的初创公司。我们认为他们从第一天起就有能力理解这项技术。它们是加密原生的，web3原生的。他们看到了这个领域可以带来的积极因素。而且，我认为这是一个重要的概念，不仅仅是把一个可能存在于链外的游戏放在一个区块链上。相反，应该利用区块链架构提供的特殊设计约束和机会，作为设计不同玩法形式的新画布。\n\n例如，链上游戏领域是一个非常新的领域，但非常令人兴奋，因为它真的——我的意思是，这是一个游戏世界，你可以在链上战斗，而不仅仅是拥有链上资产。你将区块链整合到游戏玩法中。逻辑是链上的。智能合约是架构的关键部分。所有这些都结合在一起，所以你无法创造出与链下游戏相同的游戏类型。但你可以拥有一种全新的、非常引人注目的体验，它明显是web3原生和加密原生的。我们认为这一类别将推动web3游戏的发展，但我希望我们很快就能看到更多此类内容的出现。\n\n提问：你认为区块链游戏公司的技术储备会变得更简单吗？现在它看起来仍然很复杂。他们有很多选择来选择使用哪条链以及其他东西。你认为这部分会很快变得简单吗？还是说web3将成为一套从根本上更复杂的技术?\n\nSimpson：为了游戏创始人，我希望它能很快变得更简单。你说得对，我们看到想要开发游戏的创始人需要做出很多决定，比如在哪里开发游戏。在某些情况下，这也会影响他们如何设计真正的游戏。例如，Irreverent Labs选择在Solana上进行开发。这伴随着一系列特定的决定。我们也是Mysten Labs的投资者，我认为该公司在游戏和娱乐方面的架构非常出色。它为这种用例设计了一个非常不同的编程模型。\n\n好消息是，创始人拥有越来越多强大的、技术上合理的选择。毫无疑问，我们还有很多工作要做。我们仍然处于基础设施建设阶段。但只要有新的技术领域出现，情况就会是这样。需要构建工具。基础设施的轨道需要变稳固。它需要经过实战检验。在这方面，它正在发生。只是需要一点时间。\n\n提问：通过去中心化，这也有机会改变游戏和大型科技公司之间的关系，这些公司是游戏行业的中间商，他们一直在分一杯羹。这方面的机会有多吸引人?\n\nSimpson：绝对很吸引人。**能够掌控自己的命运是非常重要的，也是非常吸引人的。**\n\n提问：你是否认为除了区块链还有元宇宙都是游戏的赢家，而不是其他类型的群体？无论是大型科技公司、企业还是品牌。\n\nSimpson：我觉得你提到的这些类别有很多重叠的地方。它们并不完全相同，但在边缘有重叠。我们认为一些相同的重要支柱是这些概念的核心。我们最近发表了一篇关于我们认为是元宇宙的七个基本要素的文章。像开放和去中心化这样的事情对我们认为的元宇宙的最终状态很重要。显然，有些人试图推出封闭的元宇宙，但我们认为机会在于开放的元宇宙。\n\n同样地，人们也在以更传统的形式发行封闭生态系统的游戏。我们在Web3游戏中看到了机会，它是开放的，并给予玩游戏的社区更多所有权。肯定有一些相似之处，也有一些重叠之处。在某些情况下，你会看到游戏生活在元宇宙中。界限有点模糊了。但现在它们都是实验性的，非常令人兴奋的领域，它们正在推动前沿。\n\n我认为web3组件在元宇宙和web3游戏中都是重要的元素。我的意思是，代币作为所有权的一部分，持久的数字身份，去中心化，所有这些对Web3来说非常重要的概念。这些元素在元宇宙和游戏环境中都是不可或缺的。这就是一些相似和重叠的地方。\n\n提问：如果存在Web3的支持者和反对者之间的战争，那么决定性的因素可能是我们拥有多少优秀的游戏开发者加入并取得巨大成功的例子。我想到了像Mythical 或Forte这样的公司。Paul Bettner的公司，Wildcard Alliance。他们都非常专注于制作具有NFT功能的硬核游戏。但我也会回想起免费游戏的赢家，并不是把《侠盗猎车手》放到手机平台上。而是Supercell。对比一下Axie Infinity的开发者和制作硬核游戏并将其引进的开发者，你认为谁最值得关注?\n\nSimpson： 我们既投资了web3原生平台，也投资了新进入游戏领域的创始人，以及在传统游戏领域拥有悠久历史的创始人。我觉得这不是一个人对另一个人的问题。**我们寻找的是那些能够理解如何创造出一款优秀游戏，并且能够理解Web3技术并能够看到机遇和限制的人。**这就得到了我之前描述的东西。这是一个不同的设计空间。这意味着，在某些方面，它可以更好，而在其他方面，它可以更具挑战性。我们没有优先考虑一种类型的创始人或一种模式。相反地，我们正在寻找创造出优秀游戏的关键见解，并支持那些我们认为能够创造出优秀游戏体验的顶级团队。\n\n提问：你们是否在公司的不同部门都有专业知识，或者你们都变得更加多学科，学习一些关于元宇宙、加密货币和区块链的知识?\n\nSimpson：我们都是加密和web3的通才，尽管我们中的一些人倾向于专注于某些领域。我更关注于应用层，消费者元宇宙，Web3，游戏等等。如果有一项投资与此相关——例如，Mysten Labs，一个拥有大量主要面向应用层游戏技术的出色团队，以及其他我花了大量时间研究的公司——在这种情况下，它可能是基础设施投资，但它仍然支持这个类别。\n\n提问：我想很多人会希望我问你，我们什么时候才能摆脱这个加密货币的冬天，但我不知道这对你的计划是否重要。\n\nSimpson：**我们需要从长远的角度来看待这个市场。**在这个领域待了一段时间后，我们看到了周期的来来去去。在现实中，它们很难预测。我的工作是寻找伟大的技术专家，帮助他们建立自己的业务，而不是做短期预测。不幸的是，我在这方面帮不上什么忙。但好消息是，我们最近公布了45亿美元的基金。这说明了我们在这里看到的机会的规模，以及我们对这一领域的未来感到非常兴奋的事实。\n\n提问：你今天还有什么想评论的吗?\n\nSimpson：我们认为web3游戏是最令人兴奋的领域之一。看到游戏把人类带进Web领域真的太神奇了。我曾与许多人交谈，他们说:“哦，我最初接触加密货币是因为我开始玩Axie Infinity。”这是让人们了解这项技术及其功能的重要方式。我很期待看到这个领域的其他成就。\n\n \n

{"id": "VuQfMcffvYM-vgXjNgcgA9qucNFDCaL4QGGcri_xZNw", "title": "比特币怎么买卖-买比特币违法么", "body": "比特币可以说是世界上第一个基于区块链技术创建的去中心化的加密货币，比特币是在2008年由中本聪发明的，距今已经有11年的时间了，近些年来，比特币的出圈让越来越多的人们开始了解到了加密数字货币的市场，而比特币也成为了这一市场中当之无愧的龙头。相信现在很多投资者手中都持有比特币，不过对于一些币圈新手来说，他们想要投资比特币，但是还不知道现在比特币怎么买？接下来就让币圈子小编为大家带来BTC比特币买入和交易教程图解。\n\n## BTC比特币买入和交易教程图解\n\n1\\.打开币安交易所官网，您可以直接点击下方链接进入（注意要先开vpn注意避开美国地区的）\n\n[https://accounts.binance.com/zh-TW/register?ref=RXKE7LXW](https://accounts.binance.com/zh-TW/register?ref=RXKE7LXW)\n\n官网，根据下方提示依次选择【使用手机号或邮箱注册】--【台湾】--【邮箱】(推荐QQ、网易163、搜狐邮箱)填写邮箱、密码，点击【注册】\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LFZHPq9GBixMq-xY6b54D.png?height=1094&width=1348)\n\n2\\.注册之后需要进行身份验证，您可以通过【用户中心】-【身份认证】进行身份认证，在该页面可以查看当前认证级别，它决定了您的账户在币安的交易限额。如需提升额度，请依次完成各个级别的身份认证。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vbr7j5lrgVCzVPwpn6gOj.png?height=547&width=2048)\n\n3\\.完成身份验证之后，在首页点击【一键买币】进入交易页面\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FtUZ4YmY2PsiK64uMS1iK.png?height=685&width=1548)\n\n4\\.然后选择【自选区】，根据需求选择合适的商家，点击【购买USDT】。根据弹窗提示向卖家付款，点击“我已付款”等待卖家放币即可。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/idyp0VGh9CH6A6iGRG8r6.png?height=787&width=1534)\n\n5\\.点击行情进入币种页面，搜索比特币英文简称BTC。\n\n6\\.点击BTC/USDT交易对，进入购买页面\n\n7\\.填写购买数量，点击买入，若是卖出，填写卖出数量，点击卖出即可。\n\n## 比特币前景如何？\n\n投资者问比特币今后走势到底会怎么样？首先我们一定要认清这个市场的投资者构成。目前这个市场投资者主要是大资本的市场，就是像马斯克这类世界富豪，大资本进入到了加密数字货币市场。在这样一个情况下，比特币价格今后它跌也不会跌到哪里去，如果比特币暴跌，大资本就会被套牢，他们一定会靠资本实力左右市场走势，但大涨也有局限性。\n\n因为现在全球央行包括监管部门对比特币越来越趋向于加强监管，防止比特币过度投机炒作，特别是防止比特币逃避各个国家的外汇管制，进行洗钱，跨境转移资产，把钱洗白，防止比特币充当这种手段，所以说在这种情况下，大资本不断进入要托盘；监管部门不断给比特币泼冷水让他冷静下来，比特币价格可能会大跌，大跌以后可能会报复性反弹；报复性反弹，又遇到监管强力监管，又会大跌，又会报复性反弹。\n\n一般投资者能不能投资比特币？我是坚决反对，特别在中国。如果央行把出入金这个渠道卡死，包括你线下交易卡死的话，首先，你在监管政策过程就面临着很大的一个风险。我不知道现在已经在线下交易这一块，我们叫线下市场这一块，出入金现在是否正常？你以前进到这个账户里的资金，现在取出来会是个怎么样？持有比特币的，想把它卖掉变现能不能变现，现在都有疑问。这一块风险比较大，所以中国现在基本上对比特币在监管上会越来越趋紧。\n\n投资者在中国投资比特币，首先考虑到是否违法违规，第二个就是我说的这个监管政策，这种风险一定要考虑。\n\n本质上来说，比特币不是这种工薪阶层，这种小资本投资的市场，在那里一夜暴富觉得很难，因为他是大资本的市场，目前这种行情基本上就是可以说是大资本在左右着。这样的话，小资本进去以后，成为虾米被大鱼大资本吃掉可能性很大。这里提醒投资者一定要注意。\n\n另外一个就是我们说加密数字货币，她是完全以区块链为技术，是个去中心化分布式账本和全员信用背书的，它的生命力就在这个地方。所以中本聪设计之初，比特币实质上是为了防止主权货币过度贬值，无形中掠过老百姓的财富，实质上它是冲着国际货币-美元去的。如果沿着这个目标走下去，我觉得比特币的前景还是有的，并且前景还非常广大。一时半会儿这种加密货币市场还消失不了。我们知道有个大空头叫达里奥，他是桥水基金的一个创始人，董事长，他以前竭力反对比特币，而现在也开始力挺比特币，也准备投资比特币，这个转变当然对投资者应该会有一个启发。", "timestamp": 1658146691, "digest": "T0XBxa23SGpScGCSlJBGi7Nj6kJ2vauL5TUlxyLOaaA", "contributor": "0xeE0974e1f9C1826c4B9389b4f532c1de5bb9F41E"}

{"id": "e_JMj-dw6r2ik3ChzPbBlv3jS9gWmoAdZl4oV6A_V5E", "title": "Test Dao Quick Tips: How to Not Fail at Gnosis-Safe", "body": "### You ever wonder “sweet,  I’m a multi-sig signer”  life is going to be great!  Right??\n\nLife is indeed great as a multi sig signer, (or a multi signatory for the cultured of us).  You get to have a say in what compensation gets to be approved, and sometimes, you get airdrops! We love airdrops!  You can feel that special twinkle of joy in your spirit when you’re voted in as a multi sig, or chosen, or volunteered.\n\nOf course, being a multi signatory comes with its own pains, struggles, and annoyances.  I’ve gathered a few tips based on my own failures as a multi signatory, and maybe, this might help you make your life the sweet joy of multi-signerness that have come to expect.  Lets begin.\n\n### 1. Pay attention to your notifications!\n\nDiscord notifications are awful.  We know they’re awful, and if you’re like me, you’re more than likely to miss 75% of them because you’ve opted to a good nights sleep instead of productivity.  (A good nights sleep is productive, don’t let any crypto bro tell you otherwise).\n\nSometimes, you’re going to see notifications that are something along the lines of “hey fren,  confirm your transaction please!”  \n\nI have come to find out (and yes i probably should have known) that gas fees can make or break a transaction.  Gas fees can also change at any given moment in time.  A delayed transaction (as I’ve suffered plenty of times over the last month)  will cause more problems than they’re worth.  \n\nI’ve suffered quite a few rejections of transactions due to the gas limits changing and getting out of whack after starting a transaction.   Having singers pay attention to their notifications, and signing if they are free, almost always can solve issues leading to transactions needing to be rejected. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A10afCdxWp8xk2vRht_Fa.png?height=328&width=1326)\n\n### 2. Explore the types of apps that could work with Gnosis.\n\nThere are more apps available than [Parcel](https://parcel.money/).  Most people assume that Gnosis only works for paying out contributors during remuneration time, and for not much else.\n\nThe types of apps that work for gnosis are interesting.  From apps that can drain your wallet, to apps that can set up recurring payments for contributors,  there are more options to explore when it comes to Gnosis-Safe compatible apps. There are even apps that can help you with swapping tokens around.\n\nAs long as you keep tip #1 in mind, its important to check out the different types of apps that are available that have Gnosis-Safe compatibility.  Try some swaps (with guidance from your fellow contributors of course) try some invoicing apps, and more.  If you do not see an app that is readily available, use the wallet connect app.\n\nMost importantly,  realize there’s more to the Gnosis-Safe than remuneration occurring monthly. It’s almost exciting to investigate.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LEUpyAJ_L-eJ31NKjXbCp.png?height=594&width=1105)\n\n### 3. Don’t be afraid to bug people to respond to their transactions.  Whether they need to be confirmed or rejected.\n\nBe strong, young grasshopper,  if you need to get the transaction completed, then you need to get the transaction completed.   Reach out to your fellow multi sig signers to get things moving along. \n\nHopefully platforms such as [Den](http://onchainden.com), and others, can help with notifications to take the work off of my back with bothering people.  There can be more time spent testing projects, right? \n\n### 4. Having trouble completing a confirmation via the mobile app?  Before giving up, try completing on the computer instead.\n\nHaving gnosis-safe available on mobile (excuse me, on iPhone) is a convenience, but not always functionable. If you run into an issue with using gnosis on your phone, try using your computer before giving up.  Sometimes, the simple answer, is the best one.\n\n### 5. Name your owners, and name your multi sigs!\n\nFor Test DAO, I somehow inadvertently added a mysterious unknown wallet address to the multi sig.  For days, I couldn’t figure out who this person was.   Clearly an unsafe move, it would have been a better move to figure out the names of who happens to be on the multi sig before I started completing transactions.  \n\nYou can do the same when importing your safe.  Unless you have an ability to memorize numbers (and some people do), its always a pain when you come across multiple safes and you have no idea which safe belongs where?\n\nYour life can be made so much easier by simply naming your safe.  We all need things to be as simple as possible when dealing with paying people, right?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QpR5GO5mok0MwFXcZBKdk.png?height=491&width=410)\n\n### Conclusion - there are always more tips to add, so let me know what you have for us here!\n\nThis is not a definitive list of gnosis tips. Whatever tips you have for gnosis management will be more than welcome to have a place on this list.  Please let us know if you have any more tips!  The story doesn’t end here, its only just begun!\n\nReach out to me on twitter - http://twitter.com/infinitehomie\n\nOr find us in discord: http://discord.gg/thetestdao", "timestamp": 1658148242, "digest": "GR6xgPIKEEwSEm1JOxbRTPpLecIur2SmH0xgWd92Rlk", "contributor": "0x96AC4a8925288b224972A007Ca91C99b46a02d1D"}

Mainly because so many of the jokes in *Robin Hood: Men in Tights* are predicated on anachronisms. But also because an awareness of them can help prevent misunderstandings when they are used. As technology advances, anachronisms are inevitable as we attempt to fold new developments into our everyday language. The classic example is referring to a car as a “horse-less carriage”.\n\nWhen the term wallet is used in the crypto space, it is used anachronistically. The term gets the job done, but often leads to confusion about what exactly a wallet is or does. You may hear of web3 wallets, crypto wallets, bitcoin wallets, or ethereum wallets. When I was coming up, all the cool kids had a Fossil wallet, the long checkbook kind. I am writing an article on web3 and cryptocurrency, so clearly I did not have this kind of wallet. I’m pretty sure mine was Dockers brand. Definitely a trifold.\n\nSo what is this new kind of wallet exactly? A web3 wallet is software that allows you to interact with a blockchain. Remember, the blockchain maintains records. In a typical cryptocurrency setting, these records are records of transactions. A wallet allows you to initiate new transactions or new records on the blockchain. Of course these must be confirmed and validated by the network.\n\n### What’s in Your Wallet?\n\nWeb3 wallets do not hold or contain any cryptocurrency in the way that a traditional wallet would hold dollar bills. This is the main anachronistic misunderstanding that needs to be avoided. What they contain is the software necessary to interact with a blockchain network. They also contain two cryptographic keys. These keys are referred to as a Public Key and a Private key. These two keys are the most important thing contained in a wallet.\n\nThese two keys are the basis of the cryptography that secures the blockchain. The typical analogy used to describe them is a padlock and key. The public key works like an open padlock that you can give to anyone. You keep the private key, which opens the padlock. When they want to send you something, they secure it with the padlock. Once the padlock is secured the only way to open it is by using the Private key, which only you should have.\n\nBoth of these keys are very long and complicated alpha-numeric codes. For example, the public key for my Ethereum wallet is:\n\n*0x14237e3a87BDa9FC4aD65ED2a2c9d43F535f73CF*\n\nThis code represents me on the ethereum blockchain. This is my address or identity. This key is public, so it is safe for anyone to have it. If someone wants to send me something, such as cryptocurrency or an NFT, they would send it to this address. “Sending it” would mean they use their wallet to create a transaction that assigns or records ownership of the item to my address. Now it is under my control. It has been locked with my public key. I can leave it locked or I can unlock it and send it to someone else. In order to unlock it, I would need the other thing inside my wallet - my private key. Private keys must be kept secure. Private keys are used to unlock the cryptocurrency, NFT, or other item and send it to a new address. The person who has the private key is the person who has control over the items associated with the paired public key. If your private key is lost, your ability to access and control any assets associated with your public key address is lost as well. Wallets help you keep up with these keys.\n\nWithin a wallet, you can create and manage multiple Public key / Private key pairs which operate like different accounts.\n\n### Getting a Wallet and Some $Crypto\n\nThe first thing a person has to do to interact with the web3 world is to get a wallet. There are lots of options. Some wallets are designed to work with a single blockchain only, such as a bitcoin wallet. Other wallets, called multi-chain wallets, can interact with multiple blockchains and allow you to manage different types of cryptocurrencies through the same wallet interface. Once someone has a wallet, they can connect to an online exchange to trade their American dollars for cryptocurrency or an NFT. (I know I keep mentioning NFTs without explaining what that is. That will be the next article.) The exchange will then create a new transaction that assigns the agreed upon amount of cryptocurrency to the pubic key address of the wallet. It is now locked with that Public key. Once the transaction is added to the blockchain record, the person “owns” or is in control of that cryptocurrency because they are the only ones who have the Private key to unlock it.\n\nRemember, when this cryptocurrency is “sent” to the new user, nothing is actually sent. This is often a hard concept for people to get their minds around, but an incredibly important one to understand. Instead, the record on the blockchain is updated to show that their address now controls the cryptocurrency they purchased. In this way, they own it. The cryptocurrency is not in their wallet, but rather their wallet contains the Private key that allows them to control the cryptocurrency.\n\n## Types of Wallets\n\nThere are some important distinctions among the types of wallets out there. These distinctions are typically based on a trade off between ease of use and security.\n\n### Hardware wallets are for Hardcore People\n\nThe first type of wallet to consider is a hardware wallet. This is the most secure type of wallet. These typically look like a USB thumb drive. The reason they are so secure is because they can be unplugged from your computer and buried in a coffee can in your yard. Without that device and the Private key it contains, no one is gaining access to your cryptocurrency. The downside is, if you forget where you buried the coffee can you aren’t gaining access to your cryptocurrency either. These are also going to be password protected, so if you lose your password you won’t be able to get into the device to access any cryptocurrency associated with that wallet. There is also the possibility that the device itself could break, leaving you in the lurch without a way to access your cryptocurrency.\n\nWhen you use a hardware wallet, you and you alone are in control of your Private key. Therefore, you and you alone are in control of your cryptocurrency. If something happens to your hardware wallet, there is no tech support to email or call to help you get it back.\n\n### Custodial vs Non-Custodial\n\nMost people are going to use a software based wallet that is accessed through a computer, web browser, or smartphone app. The major distinction between these types of wallets is Custodial vs Non-Custodial.\n\nA Custodial wallet is a wallet that you access through a third party or custodian. These types of wallets are the most user friendly in the sense that if you have any issues or forget your password, there is normally tech support options and the usual password recovery options. The reason they are able to offer so much help is because they hold both the Public and Private key. This is helpful when it comes to ease of use, but it presents a major risk when it comes to security. The reason it presents such a security risk is because you are not actually in control. Instead, you are trusting a third party, which is really antithetical to the entire web3 ideal.\n\nOne of the biggest risks associated with Custodial wallets is for the custodian to go out of business. If you use a Custodial wallet through a company that goes out of business, you will most likely loose access to your wallet and the keys it contains. Without that private key, you cannot control any of what you own. This was a very common issue in the early days of cryptocurrency when companies would pop up and then fail quickly. In fact, there is quite a bit of cryptocurrency sitting on the blockchain, never to be accessed again because someone lost their access to their Private keys when a company went dark.\n\nAnother risk to Custodial wallets is the potential for censorship. If the third party custodian decides for some reason, political or otherwise, that you should not have access to your cryptocurrency, then they can cut you off by removing your access to the Private key controlling your cryptocurrency. \n\nArguably the best happy medium between a hardware wallet and a Custodial wallet is a Non-Custodial wallet. These are sometimes referred to as Self-Custody wallets. These are wallets that only you control, so there is no third party who has access to your keys. These wallets live on your device. These can be desktop applications, web browser extensions, or smartphone apps. The main security risk is that the device they live on will typically be connected to the internet and therefore have the potential to be hacked. Also, the device could be stolen. These wallets are password protected. If you lose your password, there are some limited options for recovering the password. Typically password recovery is through a “seed phrase” which is a long collection of random words that essentially function as a very secure backup password. If you lose your password and your seed phrase, you are toast. It will be very difficult to recover access to your wallet and the Private key it contains.\n\n## That Thing They Keep Saying\n\nIf you wander around the crypto world for very long, you are sure to run into someone saying, “Not your keys, not your coins”. This is a good summary of how to understand wallets and control of cryptocurrency. Wallets contain keys. These keys are used to control the cryptocurrency associated with them. If you don’t have access to the keys because you lost access to your wallet, then you can’t control your coins.\n\nAnother thing people will say is, “I have some bitcoin in my wallet”. This is simply not true. This is an anachronistic understanding of what crypto wallets do. Even when people say they “own” cryptocurrency, this isn’t exactly the case. What they own, or what they are in possession of, is the Private key that allows them to control the coins associated with a particular Public key. This control plays out on the blockchain record where the software contained in a wallet allows the person to create a new record that shows the cryptocurrency is now assigned to a different Public key, which represents the address or identity of a different person. This new person will be the new owner, so long as they have their Private key.\n\n## End Note\n\nSince the last article I published, cryptocurrency prices have tanked. Some people are crying because they lost a bunch of money. Other people are patting themselves on the back for being so shrewd and knowing better than to invest in something as silly as computer money.\n\nNo one should be surprised. It was a bubble and the bubble popped. Many people have been forecasting a so-called Crypto Winter for awhile. Is this it? Maybe. Could things go lower? Maybe.\n\nThis isn’t all bad. (Easy for me to say, I didn’t just lose my shirt.) This will be a chance for web3 applications that are actually good, useful, and solve problems to rise to the top, while less valuable ideas and scams will get left behind. Projects that are inherently valuable will hang around and get better.\n\nI’ll keep writing; you keep reading. If and when you decide to join the web3 world, it won’t be because of hype, but rather because you understand what you are getting into and you see the real value in it.", "timestamp": 1658148862, "digest": "BeYtuWB2KHVJGRFK9XPUHjqA9yXpnad77Mxzw_OMfRk", "contributor": "0x14237e3a87BDa9FC4aD65ED2a2c9d43F535f73CF"}

In a broader sense, *Crisis* is an ongoing multi-media, multi-level experiment that explores alternative ideas for the distribution and exploitation of musical works. It is the journey of an album that defied the dominant structures of its system in order to break new ground.\n\nThis project aims to align *releases* ↔︎ *value* ↔︎ *community* into one common narrative. Read more about the process below.\n\n## Season 00 – The Story\n\nOne year ago the journey of Crisis began with the release of *[Crisis (The Worthless Album)](https://open.spotify.com/album/7nwbv2tj8q9OTWhin3ZBsm).* What had been planned as a traditional release, changed due to a pivotal decision.\n\nThe album was cut into 30 pieces, each 29 seconds long. Since a stream only starts counting after 30 seconds of playtime, it can't collect plays or earn any revenue, no matter how much it's listened to. The value of this album is 0.000$\n\nUltimately, this is the only way to choose one's own value in the current system of being patronised by a pro-rata system (streaming) of big tech and major labels. By releasing an album this way, it reveals quite the imbalance and absurdity of the music industry's current monetisation model and asks if centralised platforms should define the value of art according to a demand-supply calculation. Or, instead, shall creators regain complete control over the value they create.\n\n> \"*Valentin Hansen released an album in a way that’s never been done before. In doing so, he highlighted the unprecedented shift in how music is being made as a direct result of the rule.*\"\n> — Brian Harrington, [The Album That's Worth Nothing](https://deathbyalgorithm.substack.com/p/the-album-thats-worth-nothing)\n\nNo matter how many of the industry tricks we utilised, we ended up in a zero-sum game.\n\n![An exhibition with a click farm.

To put it more simply, we will distribute ownership of *Crisis* during 9+ seasons.\n\nTherefore, the original album was minted as one piece of music on [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/valentinhansen/crisis-the-album-).\n\nOwnership of this NFT will be represented by each season's tokens (editions of NFTs), with 50% of the shares being transferred within the first nine seasons. Additionally, each season represents the album in its current form. As seasonal NFTs are collected, the album starts to change visually, sonically, & experientially until that particular season sells out.\n\nUpon sellout, a new season unlocks, shape- shifting the album once more and unlocking further experiences, products, visuals, etc.\n\nThe remaining 50% will be allocated in season 10.

The following user and comment system is under developing.\n\n## How it works\n\nMetamask browser version support others sending a message that can only be decrypted by the address owner, so Ingang send an encrypted message to you, this message include a key that both sides can use it to encrypt and decrypt, every time user login, this key will renew, so this can make sure that the message received and send is only for the address owner. To send message that can only be decrypted by address owner, I need to get your EncryptionPublicKey use this function , so as your first time login, it will ask you to provide the encryption public key, this is not even your public key of you ETH account.\n\nThe Ingang does not track you any data, all information comes from your Metamask address, you don’t need to worry about traditional privacy problems.\n\nThe current goal of Ingang, to encourage good content producers come to publish valuable information. Every month income from the advertisement will **directly send ETH** to the top producers, the proportion and distribution is still under consideration, but now I think it should be more than 50% of profit every year.\n\nAlso after Ingang grown up ( I hope it could be : ), it can run as Substack or some other profitable business to support it running.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nCurrently, user following function is under development. It should be release soon.\n\nNext step will be upload content to system like Arweave or IPFS, I am still learning how it works and how to implement this.  Since upload content to this kind of system is expensive, which content to be uploaded will be selected by rule, not by people, for example, if user address is new or asset is under 100 USD, it’s content can only send to IPFS 1Mb every week, unless it become top generator once. But all this is still under consideration. This is just a framework I am thinking about, this is a trade off between open security and cost.\n\nAfter this, it should be to do some job as address analysis, the main page content will recommend depends on the user address, this will be a big job.\n\n### (Updated on 26/6/2022)\n\nFollowing system is somehow working now, next is redesign the UI\n\n### (Updated on 12/7/2022)\n\nNew UI deployed, next step is add function of nickname.", "timestamp": 1658149311, "digest": "ukWKrGCEckczZY3EtrO4lAmlTenHfEzDgDCRvKcTxGY", "contributor": "0xC3a21b522F39120290D63A2ad250ca7CB81FAb1F"}

The following user and comment system is under developing.\n\n## How it works\n\nMetamask browser version support others sending a message that can only be decrypted by the address owner, so Ingang send an encrypted message to you, this message include a key that both sides can use it to encrypt and decrypt, every time user login, this key will renew, so this can make sure that the message received and send is only for the address owner. To send message that can only be decrypted by address owner, I need to get your EncryptionPublicKey use this function , so as your first time login, it will ask you to provide the encryption public key, this is not even your public key of you ETH account.\n\nThe Ingang does not track you any data, all information comes from your Metamask address, you don’t need to worry about traditional privacy problems.\n\nThe current goal of Ingang, to encourage good content producers come to publish valuable information. Every month income from the advertisement will **directly send ETH** to the top producers, the proportion and distribution is still under consideration, but now I think it should be more than 50% of profit every year.\n\nAlso after Ingang grown up ( I hope it could be : ), it can run as Substack or some other profitable business to support it running.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nCurrently, user following function is under development. It should be release soon.\n\nNext step will be upload content to system like Arweave or IPFS, I am still learning how it works and how to implement this.  Since upload content to this kind of system is expensive, which content to be uploaded will be selected by rule, not by people, for example, if user address is new or asset is under 100 USD, it’s content can only send to IPFS 1Mb every week, unless it become top generator once. But all this is still under consideration. This is just a framework I am thinking about, this is a trade off between open security and cost.\n\nAfter this, it should be to do some job as address analysis, the main page content will recommend depends on the user address, this will be a big job.\n\n### (Updated on 26/6/2022)\n\nFollowing system is somehow working now, next is redesign the UI\n\n### (Updated on 12/7/2022)\n\nNew UI deployed, next step is add function of nickname.", "timestamp": 1658149278, "digest": "c9m2Ph8FmlFqoPBkRxiFaWQ0EtiMqkb-V-SuT--Pdj4", "contributor": "0xC3a21b522F39120290D63A2ad250ca7CB81FAb1F"}

The solution scales along with the customer’s business. Through Europa’s solution, customers can easily mint tokenized redeemables, offer them to their communities, and deliver the digital assets to customers. This allows customers to focus on their business, rather than the underlying Web3 technology.\n\nEuropa is a proven SaaS solution built by experienced crypto engineers – that makes it simple for brands to enter web3, and tap into the customer engagement, creator monetization, and tokenized incentive structures that makes web3 so appealing to consumers and brands.\n\nE-Commerce is already a dominant, 5.5T dollar industry, and the web3 stack has the potential to disrupt it entirely.\n\nTokenization of physical goods can transform this entire market, just like decentralized finance has disrupted traditional finance, and NFTs have disrupted the traditional art market.  We are building a solution to service this niche at scale.\n\nFor more information about web3 loyalty platforms, visit [europalabs.io](https://europalabs.io)\n\n## About The Graph\n\n[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is the indexing and query layer of web3. Developers build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL.

"原文：<https://dirtroads.substack.com/p/-43-first-principles-of-crypto-governance>\n\n我家的狗Leo，讨厌兽医，一看到路标指向兽医执业的小镇，就狂吠。他讨厌兽医，因为兽医意味着针头和打针。显然，他无法理解为什么针的疼痛实际上可以保护它免受更严重、更痛苦的疾病的侵袭。打针意味着疼痛，疼痛是不好的。然而，他走进推拉门，耳朵朝下，一双湿润的眼睛似乎在要求我父亲：“我知道我们彼此相爱，你为什么要这样对我？”这就是重点：在他所生活的人类难以理解的世界中，Leo 选择相信这样的启发式方法，即由于他的家人似乎总是为他的利益行事，任何请求（甚至是痛苦的请求）都可能是其中的一部分这种充满爱心和关怀的相互协议。狗和人类几千年来一直是朋友，在绝大多数情况下，启发式方法被证明是有用的，因此它得以延续。\n\n在加密去中心化组织的创始人-主人-控制者和社区成员之间普遍存在的仁慈启发式(Heuristic of Benevolence)可能有着类似的起源。你们让我或其他人赚了很多钱，因此我永远不应该怀疑你的纯粹意图。可能是同样的原因，同样的仁义启发式变成了对任何最初没有参与社区建设的人（外来者）的怀疑启发式。\n\n启发式的问题在于它们很容易被欺骗。\n\n**哦，治理，亲爱的最小化者**\n\n上周的 Dirt Roads 讨论了 MakerDAO 最近的治理周期。最后包括三个开放性问题：\n\n基于现有的治理机制和代币分配，我们是否相信 Maker 的审查阻力？\n\n当一群（可以说）一致的各方拥有足够的投票权来超过如此多的机构参与者时，我们是否相信 Maker 是一个真正去中心化的组织？\n\n我们是否认为 Maker 的结构可以有效地处理带来最低程度的复杂性和不透明性的用例（和借款人）？\n\n这三个问题可以总结为一个问题：我们认为加密协议的主导治理框架是否可以（在本地）在处理复杂任务的同时激励善意的行为？我的直觉是，这些问题的答案只是“不”。\n\n对于 Maker，与许多其他加密项目一样，治理任务统一分配给治理代币 $MKR 的持有者。但更普遍的是，$MKR 的持有者可以对协议的更改进行投票——任何人都可以提交提案。提案将按照以下简化的流程进行投票。\n\n争论最有效的角色分配或替代角色机制超出了这篇文章的精神。我们感兴趣的是Maker 治理框架的架构师认识到恶意治理攻击的风险，为了反对它，他们包括了一个治理安全模型，该模型具有延迟特定提案执行的功能——允许 $MKR 持有者收集足够的共识来呼吁紧急关闭，然后有序地解除协议本身。\n\n由 Aragon 和 Optimism 开创的乐观治理学派通过假设所有提案都经过投票来引导这一概念，除非在一定时间内在法庭上受到质疑。这些努力值得称赞，在每个决定的结果是显而易见的、事前可衡量的或立即产生影响的环境中仍然有效。随着 DAO 的雄心壮志超越僵化和明确界定的界限，并朝着通过复杂结构增加现实世界信用等复杂任务，很明显，即使是乐观的挑战窗口也不足以抵御恶意攻击。\n\n不可还原性问题 → 最初，大多数链上治理不得不面对非常简单的决定：是否将 ERC-20 代币列入白名单、增加或减少参数、激活或停用预言机提要。治理机制不断发展以满足这一需求，而区块链技术允许更精细地分离任务。但雄心是人类的特征，协议逐渐扩展到复杂神经节的用例，而不是有序的原子决策集合：我们是否应该开始为现实世界的信贷融资，我们的资金管理策略应该有多活跃，我们应该如何应对我们的流动质押服务对原生链稳定性的影响，我们在复杂的 DeFi 堆栈中的作用等。扩展产生了一个工程师可能还无法完全掌握的不可还原性问题。在对每个可能的案例进行建模以进行决策时，在结构上不可能继续扩展。我们需要学会与无数极端情况共存，这些极端情况会产生任何无法预料的影响。不可还原性的影响可能是灾难性的。\n\n两种可能的解决方案 → 可用的解决方案有两个方向：（i）使治理机制更适合处理无法衡量的不确定性和利益冲突，以及（ii）通过任务和责任的原子化来减少不确定性。尽管从长远来看，第二个（分解、简化、僵化）是我们应该追求的目标，但不确定性不能从根本上消除，因此开发一个更具不确定性的决策框架是我们无法逃避的。\n\n这篇文章的其余部分将致力于问题的初步形式化。当事情变得复杂时，我相信开发一个简化版本的现实是有价值的。我们的想法是使用这样的框架来了解发挥作用的关键力量，并尝试设计在激励良性影响的同时减轻恶性影响的机制。\n\n**乐观治理博弈**\n\n我决定设计游戏。让我澄清一下：由约翰·冯·诺伊曼和奥斯卡·摩根斯坦开创的博弈论和经济行为理论，将数学严谨性作为现代经济学的基础，被加密货币兄弟滥用和误用太久了，我无意加入其中。这些游戏将不是博弈论，而是奇闻趣事数学。像奇闻趣事新闻一样，编写下面描述的一组方程式的目的是提供正在发生的事情的氛围，而不是提供提炼解决方案所需的象征性工具。然而，在协议治理的背景下将人际互动正式化是一项雄心勃勃的任务，我希望这将激发比我拥有更多技能和时间的其他人的兴趣。\n\n我首先构建了一个乐观治理游戏（OGG）。在 OGG 中，所有参与协议治理的人都是好人，并打算将协议本身产生的经济价值最大化——这是一个重要的规范。在这个简化的游戏配置中，我们假设参与者/选民从外部收到一个提案，并且有能力基于任意治理机制（即投票功能）通过或投票。\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/0e5ffd4e735fcc5283b352f893b80e8b.png)\n\n提案i的投票函数V以N个参与者所有投票的向量作为输入。在OGG中，我们可以假设每个参与者都有一票。投票函数的输出为0 (ding)或1 (pass)\n\n只有两种类型的提案：善意的提案和恶意的提案。 善意的提案对所有选民都有积极的影响——因此对协议也有积极影响，而恶意的提案给支持者（位于选民群体之外）带来了巨大的利益，但代价是协议有可能被破坏。\n\n被破坏的预期成本取决于分配的概率函数和每个投票者给协议的值 V。 为简单起见，我们可以假设所有善意的提案都有相同的回报，并且所有选民都为协议分配了相同的价值——并且这个价值远远高于单个通过提案的潜在价值。 由于所有选民都有相似的偏好，并且是治理集之外的支持者，我们可以从协议的角度概括上述功能。\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/ff31ac5fa4619a2da7c450f9bf4f377e.png)\n\n不出所料，我们不能提前说一个提议是善意的还是恶意的。我们需要用概率来思考。我们可以重写一个一般化提议的期望收益函数，如下所示：\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/0e3c92ebd1f93805ca98e1b032f52648.png)\n\n我们也知道，恶意提案的不良影响只会在不确定的时间延迟之后变得明显——而且只是间接地，即通过观察协议的存续情况。 换句话说，如果在 OGG 结束时——即到时间 T，协议仍然完好无损，我们最好的猜测是治理没有通过恶意提案，我们赢得了 OGG。\n\n最后，该协议，即所有投票者的总和，当面临投票赞成或反对广义的第一个提案时，旨在最大化下面的期望值函数。 这个目标是 OGG 的一个假设，因为理论上选民可能被赋予非常不同的目标函数。\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/1759a1456ac84b1bba931710baedbd47.png)\n\n被破坏的概率等于在OGG结束前出现恶性结果的概率\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/b5a10c8ea14fe5d5d9cccf571438ad38.png)\n\n鉴于 OGG 的结构非常简单，大多数结果都是微不足道的。 然而，它们值得反思：\n\n*   支持者有动力去做大→由于协议被破坏事件是核问题，支持者被激励向选民提出也提供高直接利益的提案\n*   看起来不错的主要动机→更高的（可感知的）仁慈密度简化了选民的决策\n*   流动性不足有溢价 → 延迟的提案，或者结果延迟的更好的提案，更容易被决策过程消化\n*   价值最大化并不是生存最大化→期望值最大化的策略可能会导致与协议生存最大化的一个非常不同的最优决策集\n\n**现实的治理游戏**\n\n如果我们为游戏增添一点趣味，事情会变得更有趣。现实，尤其是 DAO 现实，比我们的 OGG 复杂得多。为了我们的讨论，我想重点关注几个关键差异：\n\n*   选民也可以是支持者 → 选民和支持者之间存在部分重叠，无论是善意的还是恶意的提案——因此，我们将使用参与者一词，包括选民和支持者\n*   恶意提案对其支持者非常有利 → 恶意提案的私人（非共同）利益可能会大大超过协议被破坏对其支持者的私人影响\n*   私人和协议的视角不同 → 由于多样化和时间范围不匹配，单个选民/支持者的私人回报函数与协议范围的回报函数显着不同\n\n在现实治理游戏(RGG)中，我们可以重写如下的目标函数，现在区分了好的和坏的支持者。我们假设无论是提议还是投票都没有任何成本。\n\n好的参与者 → 一个有道德的支持者的目标函数与广义的 OGG 案例非常相似。\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/7611b5d89e030665750038de178d6231.png)\n\n然而，正如我们已经暗示的那样，我们现在已经列出了每个单个参与者 n 的预期收益，因为：(i) RGG 中单个参与者的时间范围很可能与协议的时间范围不同——即单个参与者 可能仍会出售他的投票权和离开权，(ii) 鉴于损害分摊和投资组合多样化，RGG 单个参与者的损害很可能不是核损害。 这些差异会增加优秀参与者的风险承受能力； 参与者有动力去“碰碰运气”的提议，这些提议对于议定书来说具有不可忽视的核心机会。\n\n坏参与者 → 然而，坏参与者会发生什么更有趣。 不良参与者是有意识地提出恶意提案，享有该提案的私人利益，并有意识地投赞成票的人。\n\n![](https://ctc-file.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/96c2bd948c264dafb0cdf00ab24c8980.png)\n\n不良行为者偏离的动机要高得多：（i）只有潜在的损失（而不是非凡的收益）会相互抵消，（ii）由于恶性结果的可见性更好，损失可以更容易地避免。不良参与者有巨大的动机提出恶意提案并游说好参与者以最大程度地减少对苛刻协议损害的看法。换句话说，对于每个人来说，都有很大的动机去偏离和变成坏参与者。\n\n在这个简化的表示中，偏离的动机与以下因素正相关：\n\n*   可征用性→私人偏差收益的相对大小\n*   相互化 → 社区规模，或参与者总数\n*   不确定性→感知到遇到不良建议的风险\n*   紧迫性 → 恶意影响出现的概率\n*   风险厌恶→令人惊讶的是，风险厌恶激励变成了坏人\n\n然而，系统并不是一成不变的。这意味着更多的恶意行为者将被大型和不确定的社区所吸引，他们的动机如此之高，以至于他们准备投入大量资源来渡过难关。 这会给没有正确制衡的社区造成死亡螺旋。\n\n**接下来是什么**\n\nOGG 和 RGG 都是极其简化的奇闻趣事数学游戏。尽管如此，它们仍然是一个良好的开端，并且可以迫使我们在设计我们的协调机制时照照镜子并超越修辞的个性化。\n\n包括 Maker 在内的一些协议仍然忠于“无结构的暴政” - h/t @Dermot_Oryordan，这是对纯粹主义方法的辩护，在这种方法中，利益中心(代币持有者、借款人、$DAI持有者、核心单位成员、代表、少数族裔、协议)的正规化为了去中心化的利益而遭到抵制。但是，正如乔·弗里曼在她的不朽文章中所说:\n\n“与我们想相信的相反，不存在无结构的群体。任何性质的任何一群人，为了任何目的聚在一起，无论时间长短，都将不可避免地以某种方式构建自己。 \\[…]\n\n这意味着争取一个无结构的群体与瞄准一个“客观的”新故事、“无价值”的社会科学或“自由”经济一样有用，也具有欺骗性。 \\[…] 这个想法成为强者或幸运者的烟幕，以建立对他人的无可置疑的霸权。”\n\n这是否是故意的无关紧要。但是使用我们的简化模型，同质的选民/支持者团体意味着增加不确定性、相互化和潜在的可征用性。对我来说，Maker 的治理设计是一个糟糕的设计，因为它鼓励了逆向选择（借款人之间）和不良行为者的逍遥法外。\n\n然而，加密货币治理也有很好的例子。 6 月 10 日，@skozin 在 Lido 的论坛上发布了一项提议，为流动性 Staking 协议建立 LDO+stETH 双重治理机制。在认识到存在选民（$LDO 持有者）不是那些遭受破坏的人（主要是利益相关者）的代理问题后，支持者提出了一系列与我们在 RGG 中概述的框架一致的想法：\n\n*   通过僵化缩小治理范围→减少不确定性\n*   延迟执行投票提案→减少紧迫性\n*   为 $stETH 引入否决/反否决系统 → 减少相互化\n*   实施（部分）恶意资源销毁→减少可征用性\n\n该提案明确承认不可能事前识别所有潜在的攻击媒介或边缘情况，并转而采用基于第一原则的方法，该方法在承认存在利益冲突的同时，激发了对抗性（且代价高昂）的治理辩论.我会敦促参与设计治理原则的任何人彻底通过该提案。这是一个值得象征性表示的东西。\n\n双重治理体系并不是唯一可行的途径。需要更深入分析的值得一提的是 Pocket Network 的权益工作机制、DXDdao 的基于声誉的投票、声誉和参与衰减机制，以及显然是以太坊的 EIP-5114 灵魂绑定。不确定性密集环境的治理机制的研究和设计空间是广阔而迷人的。我们真的无法在人类交互的脆弱基础层之上构建任何复杂的东西。\n\n选择现成解决方案的极端主义对政客来说是好事。但我们不是政客，我们要留在这里，我们的目标不是在船烧毁之前跳船。除了低头，我们别无选择；学习、研究、测试、迭代和梦想。\n",

{"id": "1_jyYDQyMOSg72UHwVSOy2TlaQof_2aP5qNCH9-wJ5A", "title": "关于NFT的畅想（四）", "body": "NFT如果具备跨场景的通用性，那无疑NFT的生态就会迅速地发展和扩张。但由于缺乏激励，在当下的加密生态中，一个场景中的NFT很难主动被其它场景接纳和包容。那有没有可能反过来一个NFT产生的场景足够强大并强大到囊括其它场景中的NFT，甚至主动被吸引其它场景中的NFT加入到这个生态中呢？\n\n我认为这是有可能的，无聊猿就有正在向这个方向发展的苗头。\n\n始于2021年的那一拨NFT热潮中诞生了多种NFT生态，包括头像类NFT，艺术品NFT，游戏类NFT等等。但毫无疑问，出圈能力最强，影响最大的就是以无聊猿和加密朋克为首的头像类NFT。\n\n无聊猿团队以其强大的运营能力迅速让无聊猿从NFT头像发展成为潮牌，具备了强大的品牌效应。这在由传统IP霸主（比如迪斯尼）垄断的传统IP领域是一个极其罕见的现象。\n\n在无聊猿短短这一年的发展过程中，有两件事给我印象很深：一是无聊猿收购了加密朋克；另一个就是在它计划为其它几个知名的NFT项目制作3D头像，让那些NFT持有者未来能够用它们的NFT畅游无聊猿规划的虚拟场景。\n\n这种做法显然就是希望建设一个“大一统”的NFT场景。\n\n这种做法好是非常好，但它仍然走的是传统中心化的路线：即用自己的生态影响力去收购影响其它品牌。\n\n这种自上而下的运动在我看来缺少了加密生态的原生基因：社区。\n\n但凡在加密生态中崛起并强大的生态几乎都离不开社区的共建和社区的推动。作为诞生于加密生态的无聊猿在最开始就是靠德强大的社区运作成长崛起的，但越走到后面似乎这种味道就越淡。\n\n我始终期待看到一种NFT生态，它是由社区共建来推动和发展起来的。我相信靠这样的方式成长起来的生态才是最有生命力、最有潜力的生态。\n\n一次偶然，我发现了一种基于新型知识产权协议制作的NFT。这种协议被称为CC0。\n\n这个协议和传统的知识产权协议有一个最大的区别，就是它“不保留任何权益”。在这种协议下CC0作品的原作者将放弃所有与作品相关的著作权和邻接权，不再像传统知识产权产品那样通过授权获得商业利益。同时，任何第三方都可以基于CC0作品进行任何开发和创作。\n\n在传统的中心化世界中，我们很熟悉的方法是商业授权。比如迪斯尼开发出了一款卡通形象，它通过授权使用这种卡通形象，允许商家开发衍生产品，比如带这种卡通形象的玩具、衣服等。\n\n在这种模式中，迪斯尼通过授权源源不断地获得商业收入，商家通过使用授权、利用卡通形象的影响力获得收益。但在这种商业模式中，商家需要有相当的资金和运作实力才能获得这种授权并从中获利。这个门槛对商家是相当高的，它将大量资金实力不够的商家排除在了这个授权之外，在某种程度上这扼杀了创造力和想象力。\n\n无聊猿的NFT在知识产权上相对于迪斯尼那种严格的产权协议采取了稍微宽松的协议，但它也仅仅只是允许持有者拥有所有的知识产权。这同样会引起产权纠纷。最近一个颇具争议的NFT项目RP/BAYC在我看来就有这方面的意味。\n\n而更早的加密朋克则更是如此。曾经在朋克社区引起轩然大波的NFT项目CryptoPhunks就是一个围绕朋克头像的知识产权产生纠纷的典型。\n\n早期的我对这些纠纷仅仅只是把它们看作名声和利益之争，但当我看到基于CC0协议的NFT之后，我认为早期的这些纠纷固然涉及到名声和利益之争，但更本质的还是反映了围绕NFT创作存在的一些根本性问题。\n\n这些根本性问题实际上阻碍了NFT由社区进行推动和发展。\n\n而基于CC0协议开发的NFT在我看来，就打开了NFT通过社区进行协作、发展和壮大的大门。它通过表面上的放弃权益为二次创作消除了所有的障碍，将释放NFT创作的无限潜力，激发整个NFT社区的无限想象力。\n\n风险提示：投资有风险，内容只是个人分析，仅供参考，不构成投资建议，或许我说的是错的，所以你要小心。\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Daosview)", "timestamp": 1658151087, "digest": "Yb4t-r6_TTiLSNq7wObblgr_R-2CNtyoaaU45s0s9gE", "contributor": "0x7dE6962797D4bDCDAE15fb4A258E2389fC38ecF7"}

9289 字，阅读需要约 21 分钟。觉得太长，可以把熟悉的部分直接跳过哦\\~\n\n## 1 关键时间节点回顾\n\n> 北京时间 2021 年 7 月 1 日凌晨，滴滴实行历史上独此一家的“静默上市”——没有敲钟、没有仪式、没有报道，甚至员工都不让发朋友圈，收盘时市值约 680 亿美元、4000 亿人民币；\n>\n> 7 月 2 日，网络安全审查办公室发布对“滴滴出行”启动网络安全审查的公告，为配合网络安全审查工作，防范风险扩大，审查期间“滴滴出行” 停止新用户注册。滴滴事件开始进入公众视野；\n>\n> 7 月 4 日，国家网信办通知全国应用商店下架“滴滴出行”App。根据举报，经检测核实“滴滴出行”app 存在严重违法违规收集使用个人信息问题。要求滴滴出行科技有限公司严格按照法律要求，参照国家有关标准，认真整改存在的问题，切实保障广大用户个人信息安全；\n>\n> 7 月 9 日，国家网信办通知，下架“滴滴企业版”等 25 款 App。根据举报，经检测核实，“滴滴企业版”等 25 款 App（列表附后）存在严重违法违规收集使用个人信息问题。通知应用商店下架上述 25 款 App，要求相关运营者严格按照法律要求，参照国家有关标准，认真整改存在的问题，切实保障广大用户个人信息安全。\n>\n> 12 月 3 日，滴滴宣布，将启动在纽交所退市的工作，并启动在香港上市的准备工作。\n\n网上不少文章从数据安全、政治影响、SEC 底稿审查等角度做了认真甚至透彻的分析，故不再重复。今天，我尝试从“美国主导的全球体系”角度来分析一下，这个体系是如何运作，进而做到“你创造 10 块的收益，我拿走 9 块的利润”。\n\n## 2 造富神话——创业游戏是怎么玩的？\n\n### 2.1创业艰辛路\n\n如果你是一个创业者/创始团队/高管，剧本大概是这样的：\n\n我发现了一个绝妙的 idea/产品/市场，顺便拉起了一个小团队。大家都相信我们能改变世界，一切都是很美好的样子。不过开公司太花钱了，但是经过艰苦卓绝的谈判/说服/忽悠，终于找到人愿意给我们天使投资了。虽然给的 300 万只够花 1 年的，但是有人愿意相信我、支持我，我就很开心了。虽然给出了 30%的股份，但 70%还在团队手里，这还是我们自己的事业，我们要努力！\n\n一年后，产品打磨得不错了，市场反馈非常好，但是钱花完了也没能做到自给自足，不过大家相信这是个好生意，所以还有人愿意继续投钱。历经艰苦卓绝的谈判/说服/忽悠，终于找到 A 轮投资人了！他们给我 1000 万，这次能花一年半了，虽然又给出了 25%的股份，但是股份更值钱了啊！况且我们还有 50%+在团队手里，我们要努力！\n\n一年多后，市场份额有了显著提升，并且我们有了相对稳定的赚钱模式！马上就要接近成功了，不过钱又快花完了，但是没事。经历了艰苦卓绝的谈判/说服/忽悠，终于找到 B 轮投资人了！这次拿到了 3000 万，数量不少但开销大了，也就能花个一两年吧。再次割让的 20%的股份，我们只有 40%了，但是价值可是之前的 10 倍了。而且通过投票权等方法，我们还是能控制董事会和公司方向的！\n\n之后的 6 年里，因为需要广告投放、功能开发、竞争对手贴身肉搏、快速获取新用户等各种各样的原因，我们打了一仗又一仗，加班干了一年又一年。非常幸运我们还活着没死，坚持下来的人融到了 B+/C/C+/D 等诸多轮次，每次都以 20%左右的比例稀释。虽然团队手里只有 20%左右的股份了，但是公司估值达到了 5 亿美金，30 亿人民币了，这 20%也是 6 亿！1%也是 3000 万呢！一辈子工资也挣不到这么多啊！这时，大家都期盼着公司成功上市，把估值变成市值，卖掉股票财富自由提前退休，这 8 年也算没白加班熬夜掉头发！\n\n又过了一年，我们终于和排名第二的 X 公司合并，合计取得了 86%的市场份额，一统江湖的我们，最终成功赴美上市，市值又翻了 4 倍达到了 120 亿人民币！员工都沸腾了！很晚加入的小张，也因为拿到了千分之一，成为了千万富翁。虽然这是 4 年后才能兑现的期权，不过有梦想就有动力，小张顿时觉得自己动力满满！\n\n这听上去真的是一个创业者通过奋斗改变人生，激励人心的故事啊！不过辛苦这么多年，真的能挣很多钱，甚至一辈子不用工作吗？\n\n### 2.2 一朝上市团队退休\n\n还真是的。依旧以滴滴为例，上市时团队的股权结构为：\n\n> 核心团队，持股 10.5%，投票权 20.1%；其中程维 7%，柳青 1.7%；\n>\n> 软银，持股 21.5%，投票权 21.5%；\n>\n> Uber，就是之前打仗和解的那个，持股 12.8%，投票权 12.8%；\n>\n> 腾讯，持股 6.8%，投票权 6.8%；等等等等\n\n2022 年 3 月 2 日，程维持股降到了 2.58%，柳青则是 0.25%。当前市值 200 亿美元，考虑到高点市值 680 亿美元，粗略以 300 亿美元的市值计算减持套现。程维套现 300×4.42%=13.26 亿美元；柳青套现 300×1.45%=4.35 亿美元；高管按照 0.05%计算，也有 1500 万美元。\n\n以上计算仅为粗略估算，并不代表真实数字，也没有对相关方有任何的评价或价值判断。对于个人来说，无论到手的美元是 13 亿还是 4 亿还是 1500 万，确实都是足以改变一生的财富了。奋斗十年改变一生，是很值得学习和尊敬的。\n\n那问题来了，人家企业家赚钱也是凭本事拼命干冒风险得来的，风险投资公司也都是真金白银投进来，这两者无一不是九死一生、亏损自认的。国家为什么要管控呢？难道是为了赚几百亿的利润吗？\n\n当然不是，这背后还有这样的三个问题：\n\n**1、资本逐利性与增长有限性**\n\n**2、互联网业务的基础设施化**\n\n**3、控制权争夺与代理人扶持**\n\n## 3 资本逐利性与增长有限性\n\n### 3.1 投资人的目的\n\n风险投资人为什么愿意投钱？原因很简单，就像我们买基金买股票一样，为了赚钱。那投资人为什么不去买基金买股票呢？原因很简单，这里有可能赚更多的钱。那投资人为什么愿意冒九死一生的风险投创业公司呢？原因很简单，这里有可能赚多得多的钱，以至于“一生”的项目收益远大于“九死”的投资损失。所以，如果你说我在楼下开个小餐馆，也特别赚钱，有没有风险投资人愿意来投呢？一定没有，因为他要的不是稳定赚小钱的项目，而是能在短期（一年至几年内）翻好多倍（几十倍至几十万倍）的项目。\n\n这也就是风投倾向于投互联网项目的原因——互联网产品的增长模型，天生就具有几个特点：容易复制、规模效应、利润率高。最早的三巨头新浪、网易、搜狐，都是做门户网站起家的，做的都是信息收集和分发；后来的三巨头百度、腾讯、阿里，做的是信息搜索、通讯软件、交易平台，比纯信息平台要复杂一些，但还是非实物。这里面的核心原因，就在于边际成本递减——用的人越多，每个人付出的成本越低。\n\n而实体商业往往相反，边际成本是激增的——我开一个餐厅受人欢迎，而开 100 家餐厅能累死人但反而会赔钱，选址、装修、采购、物流、质检、员工、管理等每一个环节都能够喝好几壶的。互联网相比之下就省事太多了，核心在软件产品维护及扩建服务器上，这个差别你看同样规模下两类公司的员工数量，就能有所理解。\n\n不过大家都知道纯互联网的生意好做，但是好做的生意终归是有限的。新近的三巨头字节、美团、滴滴，除了字节核心业务是纯互联网线上，另外两家已经开始 O2O 也就是线上线下混合模式了。不过即使混合了，增长速度依旧惊人。我们可以简单回顾下滴滴融资的进展和速度：\n\n![滴滴融资数据](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fnhrZiLGOqafzYKg5Ytzo.jpg?height=287&width=682)\n\n2016年起，英文字母都不怎么够用了。这些投资人投了20多轮，累计200多亿美元的投资。他们可不是慈善家，这一轮轮跟吹泡泡一样，越投越多。每一年估值至少涨两三倍，这是为啥呢？\n\n### 3.2 企业的增长极限\n\n很简单，他们相信一年后公司的成长/价值绝不止两三倍，至少得是四五倍。那么问题来了，滴滴这类互联网公司，是如何做到业务每年都以如此之快的速度增长呢？\n\n1、 市场空白期，疯狂占地，用户呈指数型增长。从最小单元（俗称 MVP）跑通模型起，就可以快速复制，每年甚至能取得 10 倍的成长。但是空白市场也有占满的一天；\n\n2、 存量争夺期，吞并对手为主，用户成倍增长。这也就是最残酷、烧钱最猛、广告最多的阶段，每打垮一个对手，或合并一个对手，都能取得用户量成倍的提升，比如历史上的滴滴快滴大战、滴滴优步大战。但是，竞争对手也会打完、市场也有占满的一天；\n\n3、 新业务开拓期，一个产品（也叫 SKU）到天花板了，还可以拓品类增加销售。比如打车好了做快车，快车好了做专车，然后是代驾、自行车、公交车、货车。但是往往新业务体量利润等指标比不上主力业务，成不了另一个主力，一般都是锦上添花，而很难成第二曲线；\n\n4、 整合变现期，市场都占满了，业务也开拓得差不多了，后续就只能开始做利润赚钱了。补贴总有停发的时候，广告也不会一直打下去，这时大家会回归商业本质，过程管理、优化流程、提高利润，俗称降本增效。但降本增效也是有天花板的，然后呢？\n\n这个时候，矛盾就凸显出来了——你说我已经很好了，一年 2000 亿的流水，150 亿的利润。但资本不这么想，它要的是增长，而且还得加速增长。一单 20 块的打车费，司机拿走 15，剩余的 5 块里做出 1 块 5 的利润，真的到头了，没法优化了。但是资本就要求你变出 2 元甚至 3 元的利润，你能怎么办呢？\n\n你应该也想到了，涨价呗——打车费涨 5 毛，司机收入降 5 毛，这 1 块钱的利润不就出来了么！\n\n屠龙少年终成恶龙\n\n## 4 基础设施化及其外部性\n\n其实这五毛一块，听上去也不是多大的事。不过呢，这就像吸毒，一旦走上了涨价这条路，就得两块三块四块的一直涨，往往很难停下来了——直到用户抗议或选择用脚投票离开。听上去涨涨价也没什么太大问题呀？大多数情况涨价不是问题，但是滴滴这类企业有一大特点，他们的服务会逐步地基础设施化。这是什么意思呢？\n\n### 4.1 基础设施\n\n基础设施的核心特点，是会被用于保证国家或地区社会经济活动正常进行的，具有公共服务性质的系统。诸如电子商务、移动支付、线上交通、甚至外卖快递等，在诞生之初确实是创新产业。但是随着近几年移动互联网的快速普及，这些都成了我们日常生活中不可或缺的部分，任意一个故障或停转，都会导致社会运行的严重问题。\n\n而基础设施如果被资本逐利性所控制，以产生最大利润为目标，会产生什么问题呢？我举一个例子，大家应该就能理解了。\n\n通信公司（如中国移动等）的日子好过吗？\n\n一二十年前，通信公司确实有一段不短的时间，日子非常舒服。以至于当年顶级学府的毕业生，求职热门目标不是什么互联网、金融，也不是公务员，而是进入通信行业的企业，特别是中国移动。原因无他，建通信网络和基础设施这件事，是真的苦；但建成了收电话费赚利润这件事，也是真的爽。所以自然从上到下的福利待遇、薪酬奖金、竞争压力等等，都特别有优势。\n\n之后 4G 诞生了，通信公司的好日子也逐渐木有了。倒不是因为 4G 干砸了赔钱，反而是因为 4G 发展得太好——国家提出了要求，各大运营商必须主动开始“降费提速”。中国移动最大的一次“降费提速”公布于 2015 年 5 月 15 日，大家可以上网自行查阅。话说，这又是为什么呢？这带来了什么变化呢？\n\n* 移动互联网的大爆发\n\n### 4.2 基础设施的社会意义\n\n是的，任何新事物的产生，都有其前提条件，就像数学的发展支撑了物理、显微镜的诞生改变了生物。没有运营商的降费提速，也就没有移动互联网发展起来的可能。大家不妨设想一下，如果移动上网资费不是现在的几十块，而是参考汇率和国外通行价格的几百块上千块，会是什么结果？\n\n上一次网流量费就要几块钱，那你还会使用移动支付吗？还会扫码骑车吗？还会玩网络游戏吗？\n\n看一段视频的流量费就要十几块几十块，那你还会视频聊天吗？还会刷抖音快手吗？还会看美女主播/带货直播吗？看完了还有钱打赏、有钱买货吗？\n\n如果没有以上这些，手机还有人买吗？app 还会有人写程序开发吗？那些投资人、创业者还会干这行吗？\n\n所以说，基础设施决定了上层应用的发展。基础设施的普及程度，也就是使用费用也决定了上层应用的发展模式、速度、规模甚至是存在与否。\n\n### 4.3 牺牲小我换取外部性\n\n而随着中国移动的基础设施化，它自身的好日子肯定不复存在了。甚至可以设想，之前投资的大笔财富建立的基站、网络、人工、体系等，还没赚到什么钱或赔着钱的时候，就不得不“降费提速”，牺牲自己了。在这个领域内，运营商确实牺牲了个体利益来推动社会前进和发展——这在经济学上叫做基础设施的外部性。\n\n中国作为一个整体，在过去几十年内，一直有着一个又一个类似的个体——行政、教育、医疗、公路、高铁、电力、水利、通信、邮政、警察、解放军等等，他们每一个人，都在做着类似的贡献甚至牺牲，也正是他们，保护着、推动着国家几十年的高速增长和发展。这真的是值得我们尊敬、骄傲及感谢的。\n\n另一个角度，我们不妨再做一下设想，如果中国移动不是“国家控制”，而是“资本控制”，以个体利益最大化作为目标，会发生什么呢？\n\n### 4.4 资本控制下的基础设施\n\n我是平行时空的“移不动”总裁办主任，针对当前情况，我觉得公司应该做以下动作：\n\n1、 “降费提速”肯定是不可能的。不论上市与否，股东们是不会接受利益损失的。作为公司经营管理者，就得为股东负责，而不是为国家负责，国家号召又不是法律，我们不是必须响应。否则，年底我们怎么跟股东解释利润下滑、成本上升呢？解释不了丢了工作谁管我们呢？我们不但不能降低利润，还得想方设法提高利润；\n\n2、 不但不降费，还得涨费。资本要持续增值，股东也想越赚越多，我们的薪酬福利才能越来越好。那怎么才能赚得越来越多呢？流量费、电话费作为主要的收入和利润来源，涨价肯定是最直接的办法。但是突然涨肯定导致大量客户流失，那就以各种理由慢慢涨价好了，涨价节奏交给运营部来办，涨价理由交给公关部来想；\n\n3、 不甘于“基础设施化”，一方面积极防御、一方面下场竞争。“x 信”这种应用绝对是“移不动”最大的竞争对手，有了不要钱的“x 信”，未来谁还会打电话发短信呢？肯定大受影响啊！那怎么办呢？\n\n1. 积极防御。经过内部头脑风暴，我们集思广益出以下方案：舆论攻势，x 信不稳定、安全性差、骚扰频繁、骗子横行，智能手机用多了影响视力、容易造成老年痴呆；“涨费”，大幅提高上网费用，让发文字的流量费超过短信费，让发语音的流量费超过打电话；“降速”，限制 x 信类 app 的访问速度，或降低其稳定性，降低用户体验。还可以配合舆论攻势——x 信优化真叫烂，要么缓慢要么断；\n2. 下场竞争。通过投资、并购、自己干等方法，一定要把未来握在自己手中！肉烂也得烂在锅里！我们可以：商谈控股或并购 x 信；扶持或投资 x 信的竞争对手；鼓励内部创业，孵化类 x 信项目；自己成立 n 个项目组，抄也得抄一个。针对我们的项目，同时在流量、费用、资源等方面，给予足够的支持和倾斜：比如定向 app 流量包；以低价货免费的方法推广；植入现有套餐推广发布；合约手机默认安装等等；\n\n4、 只要做好执行，我们相信“移不动”集团就像新时代的“喜马拉雅山”，不管是 x 信视频、手机支付、直播电商、智能出行、外卖餐饮，只要能和手机沾边的，我们都能搞定！纵使世界风云变幻，我“移不动”岿然不动！\n\n是不是有些剧情还挺眼熟的？所谓的“纯粹市场竞争”最有利于消费者，并不是事实的全部。当你大到了具备类似基础设施的级别时，个体利益的最大化，反而会阻碍整体的发展。这时就像一首打油诗一样——此山是我开，此树是我栽，要想此路过，留下买路财。\n\n### 4.5 时代变迁与基础设施发展\n\n二十年前，公路电网是基础设施，“中国移动”是上层应用；十年前“中国移动”变成了基础设施，移动互联网是上层应用；到了今天，互联网乃至移动互联网也变成了基础设施，下一个上层应用是什么尚未可知。所以有句话“这不是马云创造了时代，而是时代创造了马云”。但如果出行、吃饭、开店、交易、快递等过程，越来越多地消耗掉大多数人的大多数财产，新的上层应用一定无法顺利的破壳发展。\n\n基础设施作为长期投资，需要持续微利甚至无利运营。这和资本追求短期眼前收益是有底层矛盾的，这也是不能让资本控制基础设施的核心原因之一。\n\n大家不要觉得这些问题不可能发生，如果你身在一亿多人口的大国墨西哥，就能体验到：\n\n> 几十分钟才能下载完百兆更新包的网速；\n>\n> paypal 转账收款，就要交 4.4%+0.49 美元一笔的手续费；\n>\n> 比国内贵 50%多，但在出生、婚礼甚至宗教仪式上几乎必备的可口可乐；\n>\n> 甚至总统的上一份工作就是可口可乐某地区的 CEO。\n\n这就涉及到另一个关键问题了：\n\n## 5 新时代的经济“殖民地”\n\n“离天堂太远，离美国太近”。中国固然不会像墨西哥一样，毒贩厉害过政府和军队；也不会有发 100 块红包只能收到 95 块的微信或支付宝。但是，中国所融入的美国主导的国际体系，是不可能便宜你的——前文所讲的类似“滴滴”这样的互联网公司，就是一种高级玩法——一整套复杂的创业体系。\n\n### 5.1 资本的通吃游戏\n\n风险投资确实是败多成少、风险极高的事情。正所谓，越小的事情越难预测，越短的时间也越难看清；但是，站在更大的角度分析，站在更长的时间去观察，这件事失败的概率、看走眼的风险就小得多了。就好比 8 年前，让你判断出滴滴能成为中国最大的网约车平台，甚至最大的互联网出行平台，这个事太难了，谁也说不准。而如果 8 年前，让你判断中国未来会不会有一家公司占据互联网出行一大半乃至全部的份额？这个就很容易了，不少人都能看出来，一定是有的。\n\n作为某一家投资公司个体来说，因为资金量有限，我只能投资有限的几家公司。而如果把美元资本作为一个整体来看，钱就完全不是问题了，只要你干网约车，甭管叫啥干的咋样，都投资点看看呗。反正早期花钱也不多，投资也是一点一点加注的。只要最终胜出了一家公司（两三家也没事，再打一打或者直接合并），我就是赚的。这就是有些人常说的，所谓“投行业”。滴滴收到风投 200 亿美元，全行业应该不超过 300 亿美元。这么大的一笔钱投行业，真的值吗？\n\n### 5.2 公司收入与利润分配\n\n真的值，滴滴 2021 年收入应该在 1800 亿元左右。2000 亿投出一个每年 1800 亿营收的公司，真的不亏。那这些投资占了多少股份呢？前文所述，上市时公司团队持股 10.5%，也就是接近 90%的股权都在各个投资人手里。即使不算上市后核心团队卖掉的 6%，滴滴这家公司，也已经基本不属于中国创始团队了，它属于国际资本、也就是西方资本了。而这家公司的收入是怎么来的呢？\n\n看财报，94.3%来自中国出行市场，4.1%来自投资收益，1.6%来自海外市场。这真的是一家标准的中国公司。也就是说，滴滴的价值是靠中国的司机开车、乘客付费、程序员产品经理加班，以及“中国移动”这样牺牲了小我所构建的基础设施，一起养育孵化出来的。换句话说，如果没有去年的国家干预，后续走上一年一块钱的涨价之路，这里面压榨出的利润，90%甚至 100%都会回到美国手里。\n\n你说不对啊，不是还有 10%在团队手里么？其实这也只是看起来在团队手里。\n\n### 5.3 美股上市、控制权与代理人\n\n美元基金投资大概率都在美股上市，这里面的细节条款要求等就不和大家展开了。为什么要去美股上市呢？这恰恰是闭环的最后一步，也是控制争夺的重要一步。美股上市不仅仅是地理位置和货币种类的区别，更重要的是定价权、监管权、控制权的区别。特别在 2021 年前后，国际形势产生了重大变化。对于中国公司而言，安全形势也有了重大变化，或者叫恶化。举两个例子大家就能理解这里面的道道了。\n\n这两个例子都得感谢美国，给世界民众，特别是中国人民上了生动形象的一课又一课。\n\n其一，华为孟晚舟事件。拘禁高管迫使公司屈服，这并不是什么新鲜玩法，而是古已有之。比如法国阿尔斯通也受过类似遭遇。因为法国政府无法顶住并给予支持，阿尔斯通难逃被肢解吞噬的命运。世界舞台真的不是什么讲规则、文明竞争的地方。公司体量再大、市值再高，在国家机器面前也是不堪一击的蝼蚁。但从另一个角度讲，如果华为是美股上市公司呢？\n\n那美国真的不用拘禁孟晚舟了，因为他会有无数种办法制服你或让你完蛋。另一个国家的公司也通过自身实际的经历，帮我们证实了这样的办法真的存在。\n\n其二，俄罗斯各大上市公司。如果你持有在美国或英国上市的俄罗斯公司股票，3 月 3 日，应该已经收到了这样一个通知“由于当地政府制裁因素，目前美股、英股等市场已经暂停俄罗斯股票开仓。若投资者有相关股票持仓，需在一定期限内卖出，否则会被券商强平。截至目前，港股市场的俄罗斯股票仍然能正常交易。”\n\n所谓的个人财产神圣不可侵犯？你猜这些资产跌到地板价后，谁有资格买下来呢？为什么港股还能正常交易呢？如果某个小岛出了一些事件，美股上市的中国公司会是什么待遇呢？为什么国家限制公司去美股上市呢？为什么要求大公司都回港二次上市呢？\n\n### 5.4 培植代理人和买办的体系\n\n> “你太髙看他们了，他们懂得什么是资本主义？最多倒退到半封建半殖民地社会。资本主义是靠侵略和掠夺别的国家而积累资产的。而他们敢于侵略谁呀？不被侵略就阿弥陀佛啦！他们只能剥削本民族的百姓，或者贱卖自己国家的资源。”\n\n——毛泽东\n\n也许企业家的初心是造福人民，但整套系统和体系，根本不是为了“造福人民”这个目标而设计的。纵使极个别人能抵抗得住诱惑和系统的力量，但全世界来看，这套培养代理人和买办的系统设计是非常成功的——小到公司、大到国家，全世界范围内不被收割、独立自主、说了能算的又有几个呢？\n日本韩国加拿大、德国法国意大利、巴西智利阿根廷、泰国印尼菲律宾，名单可以列出一两百，而这里面真正独立自主的，一个都没有（能抗住不让美国驻军的就没有）——这就是为什么，当今世界是美国主导下的全球体系。\n有人说了，在我手里的股权不安全，那在我手里的钱总该是安全的吧？公司在国家面前都毫无抵抗之力，你为啥对自己这么有信心呢？\n\n![个人财产神圣不可侵犯](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nb9-6WdAmGQnSIVGzbG-s.jpg?height=785&width=639)\n\n## 总结一下\n\n1、 互联网行业为代表的创业故事，往往遵循着“风投、厮杀、垄断、上市”的剧本，美元风投投行业，内部厮杀出胜者，垄断行业拿利润，境外上市回美国；\n\n2、 而这个剧本也是美国金融体系搭建的一个完整收割闭环。为了强化闭环的执行和落地，这套体系也在有意的培育代理人，并分给其“巨额”的小利，对外包装为自我奋斗改变人生的故事；\n\n3、 问题之一：基础设施的资本化，会透支社会下一个阶段发展的动力和能量，降低民众生活质量提高生活成本，并且影响下一波生产力发展和社会进步。故，基础设施化的业务因其极强的外部性，需保持微利甚至赔钱补贴运转；\n\n4、 问题之二：境外资产的安全性，丛林法则下，永远留不住力量范围之外的资产和财富。国际社会的基本准则并不是什么契约精神、个人财产神圣不可侵犯，真实环境下的基本准则是我的规则你必须遵守、我的财产你不可侵犯。这些如何确保？拳头说了算；\n\n5、 故，在此大变局之下，不少互联网公司也会巨变：其一，基础设施化，从高增长高利润变为稳定市场微利润；其二，美股上市财务自由的路，几乎不再能复现了。\n\n希望这两篇文章的 14000 字，能给帮大家对外，多一个角度认知世界；对内，多一个方法看懂周围。那在这么艰难的时代，我们还有机会吗？答案当然是有，至于具体是什么，后面三篇文章，同样从宏观到微观，分享一下我的思考：2022，更加艰难的下一年，有无抓得住的机会。", "timestamp": 1658151517, "digest": "-CIezTxaBzmo2GzMUT2bwpIJJxJglgT6Ano8wi8ybr0",

{"id": "jz2pMrJ33aDCcoY6j0kij0Wck-sWafT4b96ZUvYG4rA", "title": "Web3 startups", "body": "These are some applications, startups and protocols that have the most potential and that are closely aligned with web3's mission of decentralization and distribution of value.\n\n**Mirror**: You could say that Mirror is the web3 alternative to Medium. A web3 protocol oriented to blogging. In the case of Medium, it is not so much the percentage that remains of the creators, so I am not going to bar them as much, but even so, it owns all the content, controls the exposure algorithms, and does not let the creators monetize themselves from other ways. It explicitly prohibits any link and is free to block anyone who does not follow \"its policies\", as it did in 2018.\n\nMirror proposes a native web3 alternative where creators can monetize in various ways they can think of. It allows, for example, to create NFT of the articles so that they can sell them or do a crowd-founding prior to writing so that fans can finance content. Also, the content is ours, not mirror's, and they use decentralized servers like Arweave (which I'll talk about later) so that the information is eternal.\n\n**Lens Protocol**: This project is focused on identity, data portability and the social. They created the social layer 0 that allows developers to invent applications that run on this blockchain/protocol and that, for example, we can switch between applications while maintaining full control of our preferences, privacy, and our connections (friends). The next Twitter, Instagram or Facebook will be built on Lens, but unlike current business models, they will not be able to exploit our information for advertising or invent vicious algorithms to keep us looking at the screen.\n\nI talk more about Lens in my other note on identity.\n\n**BAT**: Basic Attention Token is an initiative of the Brave browser that was invented by Brendan Eich who is none other than the inventor of JavaScript, Mozilla and Firefox. Brave is a browser that blocks all third-party cookies (Google Ads, etc.) that spy on our behavior in order to offer us invasive advertising. By blocking all tracheas we become invisible to corporations that want to exploit our information, and on top of that browsing is faster because you don't have to load all the JavaScript for these cookies.\n\nBut in order not to leave advertisers out, Brave offers incentives in the BAT token for those who wish to receive advertising voluntarily, let's say. So you browse, you are aware that you are giving information to advertisers and in exchange for that, you receive advertising. A win-win, or at least a fairer, logical and less extractive way. At least we get something.\n\n**OpenSea**: OpenSea is the leading marketplace for NFT exchanges. It is the easiest to understand what it is for because it is as if it were an Amazon or MercadoLibre, something that already exists, but unlike web2 marketplaces, OpenSea publishes the content of our wallets, it does not own our information. We can choose to publish them on OpenSea or quickly go to a competitor. It is as if we had an NFT of our MercadoLibre publications and we could change the platform whenever we wanted.\n\nGiven the portability of the data, OpenSea is open source, since it does not gain anything by not being open source, on the contrary, it is a competitive advantage to be open source in crypto rather than not. If you are open source and open, others can join you, allowing you to maintain your leadership position. OpenSea charges 2.5% also because it is what the market allows, otherwise a competitor that charges less can easily appear.\n\n**Arweave**: It is a network similar to IPFS+Filecoin, but under this system eternal storage is guaranteed. Due to the logic of this blockchain, the miners who receive the $AR (Arweave) token must be able to demonstrate access to random content/file at all times in order to validate new transactions. This forces the miners to continue to keep copies of the old files because otherwise they cannot continue mining.\n\nI talk more about decentralized storage in this note\n\n**ENS**: Ethereum Name Service is like a router from blockchain addresses (wallets) to names in text format, with .eth at the end. The project lets you register a domain, like a .com, but an .eth, and assign the wallet to which it corresponds. More similar to how an alias works, but this alias is yours and you can assign the wallet you need to it.\n\nENS is also an open-source protocol and is run entirely by the ENS DAO where every change or improvement is voted on. The domains have an annual cost, but they do this so that no one abuses the system and that those who use it have the opportunity to use them. Also everything generated is donated to charity, so ENS is a non-profit organization.\n\n**Metamask**:", "timestamp": 1658151891, "digest": "6q8Ed53BFv0yeOzh6F12ddOrfRHJk2FT2vrmCh47JdY", "contributor": "0x7E0b0363404751346930AF92C80D1fef932Cc48a"}

In a broader sense, *Crisis* is an ongoing multi-media, multi-level experiment that explores alternative ideas for the distribution and exploitation of musical works. It is the journey of an album that defied the dominant structures of its system in order to break new ground.\n\nThis project aims to align *releases* ↔︎ *value* ↔︎ *community* into one common narrative. Read more about the process below.\n\n## Season 00 – The Story\n\nOne year ago the journey of Crisis began with the release of *[Crisis (The Worthless Album)](https://open.spotify.com/album/7nwbv2tj8q9OTWhin3ZBsm).* What had been planned as a traditional release, changed due to a pivotal decision.\n\nThe album was cut into 30 pieces, each 29 seconds long. Since a stream only starts counting after 30 seconds of playtime, it can't collect plays or earn any revenue, no matter how much it's listened to. The value of this album is 0.000$\n\nUltimately, this is the only way to choose one's own value in the current system of being patronised by a pro-rata system (streaming) of big tech and major labels. By releasing an album this way, it reveals quite the imbalance and absurdity of the music industry's current monetisation model and asks if centralised platforms should define the value of art according to a demand-supply calculation. Or, instead, shall creators regain complete control over the value they create.\n\n> \"*Valentin Hansen released an album in a way that’s never been done before. In doing so, he highlighted the unprecedented shift in how music is being made as a direct result of the rule.*\"\n> — Brian Harrington, [The Album That's Worth Nothing](https://deathbyalgorithm.substack.com/p/the-album-thats-worth-nothing)\n\nNo matter how many of the industry tricks we utilised, we ended up in a zero-sum game.\n\n![An exhibition with a click farm.

Retail price: 0.00 $ € £ ₽ ₩](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rIQn5Iqm0bbR5OW3Wy_OU.png?height=1984&width=3062)\n\n![Spotify’s 2021 wrapped looked as expected: 0 Streams, 0 Listeners, 0 Hours, 0 Countries](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kKPpqY4bmsyioxNArLKFr.png?height=1024&width=1024)\n\n## Process\n\n*Crisis (The Album)* will now embark on a multi-level journey to be transformed and have its monetary and cultural worth evaluated by the community. To put it more simply, we will distribute ownership of *Crisis* during 9+ seasons.\n\nTherefore, the original album was minted as one piece of music on [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/valentinhansen/crisis-the-album-).\n\nOwnership of this NFT will be represented by each season's tokens (editions of NFTs), with 50% of the shares being transferred within the first nine seasons. Additionally, each season represents the album in its current form. As seasonal NFTs are collected, the album starts to change visually, sonically, & experientially until that particular season sells out.\n\nUpon sellout, a new season unlocks, shape- shifting the album once more and unlocking further experiences, products, visuals, etc.\n\nThe remaining 50% will be allocated in season 10. This way—when the album becomes the most expensive work of music ever sold—it'll be fully owned by the community that helped it reach this status.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iIhgeVic-qPXG15O8qcM5.jpg?height=2589&width=2767)\n\nThe journey will continue as long as people keep unlocking the next chapter. Season NFTs will be sold in the form of editions on Mirror.\n\n## Seasons\n\nThe journey will be split into 9+1 defined seasons as listed below:\n\n\n**↳ [Season 01:](https://kaf.mirror.xyz/Am2H3L-3e0VJKL-PeYezdAi1i559unIgTYARHn1Mg6s)**[ The Valuable Album](https://kaf.mirror.xyz/Am2H3L-3e0VJKL-PeYezdAi1i559unIgTYARHn1Mg6s)\\*\\*\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FCAUBeQwJyfV3HzyYMaWK.png?height=1174&width=2178)\n\n↳ **[Season 02: The Raw Album](https://kaf.mirror.xyz/hhc_wUnEZfnstT967p5Yy9X-K8GkmzUluwPM-7Jvwmc)**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FlrA03P0kpdXvK0qXjKA3.png?height=1174&width=2178)\n\nSeason 03: The Performance Album\n\nSeason 04: Remix Album\n\nSeason 05: The Visual Album\n\nSeason 06: The Commercial Album\n\nSeason 07: The ________ Album\n\nSeason 08: The ________ Album\n\nSeason 09: The ________ Album\n\nSeason 10: The Most Valuable Album", "timestamp": 1658152305, "digest": "t6muHDOnubQAq5jhcKEf3icIQoOHUQro46TW8t9xKd8", "contributor": "0x6fAf6Db1a026E730935a1351133C4c99DaAE4DDA"}

This will drive the creation of new applications that promote ownership, participation and community. We believe that the ownership economy will transform the internet, and with it our digital and physical lives.\n\nBut this web3 future still needs to be built and shaped. So we started Project Vellir.\n\nProject Vellir’s mission is to improve understanding of web3/crypto technology; build web3 solutions, including to problems related to governance, coordination, ownership, participation and community; and support companies and governments with the rapid transition to web3.\n\n**We do this by combining public insight, an advisory practice and in house studio, a thoughtful community and web3 native investment platform.**\n\nOur thesis is based on three overlapping themes.\n\n1. **Democratic processes and institutions:** The Vellir Project takes inspiration from Þingvellir (the \"Assembly Fields\") in Iceland, site of the longest running Parliament in the world. In the early 10th century, it was a meeting place for clans to hold discussions and legal sessions, and subsequently became the site of the Icelandic Parliament, now in Reykjavik. The site was chosen because it was accessible for all clans for their annual parliament. And while we still have the same fundamental participation, community decision-making and governance needs to address, there are no longer the same constraints on geography, physical representation and time between consulting citizens. We believe that web3 tools have the potential to be the Þingvellirs of the future – creating new accessible gathering places, and transforming how participatory systems, governance and policy processes, models and institutions work.\n2. **Financial inclusion:** Financial inclusion means more than just having access to a bank account. It means having a meaningful stake in society and the capital economy. This requires ownership of data and assets, and means that close creating value with the insights from their data also gain some of the upside. The rise of the sovereign individual has the potential to radically change financial inclusion through DeFi, community ownership and social tokens. We believe that this broader democratisation has the potential to create universal basic equity, which could be an important feature of a more equal and fair social and economic structure.\n3. **Protecting and rewarding data, privacy and security:** A core part of a positive internet future is one where data is owned and encrypted; privacy is the default and built in; and infrastructure is secure. The web3 stack is evolving quickly, but we believe it must have these features embedded from the outset in order to be sustainable and meet the needs of consumers.\n\nSubscribe to get our latest insights at www.vellir.xyz - and come and start your web3 journey with us!", "timestamp": 1658151974, "digest": "rF4qJVS6w1ZmEnkOjYu1Fj7FM8fNYvFJzrtnMeTLMJs", "contributor": "0x497C01E5cE8B7d3D5175e192f0bd09d1daC912c4"}

Hemos pasado de usar el correo a tener tokens que nos dan **acceso** a diferente **contenido**.\n\nNos gusta formar parte de comunidades, nos gusta tener algo especial y único para nosotros. Coleccionamos cromos desde pequeños y nos gusta juntarnos con gente con la misma **visión, gustos y/o interés**.\n\nEsa es la **experiencia** que se genera con un **token**, nos da un **prestigio**, un **estatus** social y además de todo eso, tiene **escasez**, la **experiencia** de tener algo **exclusivo** solo para unos cuantos.\n\nEn este artículo explicaré como nació token gating y como de dar acceso a una página web, se ha convertido en un **estándar en el ecosistema**.\n\n### Utilidad del token\n\nEn todos los social tokens o monedas de comunidad, hay tres característicos importantes:\n\n* **Utilidad**: que le ofreces a tu comunidad si compran tu token\n* **Distribución**: a quien distribuyes tu token\n* **Liquidez**: tener un mercado secundario donde nuevos miembros puedan comprar y entrar en la comunidad\n\nA día de hoy, tenemos 20.258 monedas en el mercado.

Esto que parece obvio ahora, hace unos años no se percibía de la misma manera. El foco estaba en DeFi, estaba en proporcionar **liquidez** y poco a poco en **distribuirlo** a miembros específicos, los famosos airdrops. Pero pocos se enfocaban en el next step, en **qué hacer con el token**.\n\nDesde [MintGate](https://twitter.com/mintgate_io) estudiamos cómo se comportaban los tokens y de qué manera un artista, un creador de contenido o una marca los pueden utilizar.\n\nLa primera pregunta fue; ¿qué le gusta a un fan, que le hace sentir especial? La respuesta: **exclusividad**. Sentirse parte de una comunidad cercana, poder comunicarse con su creador de contenido favorito y tener privilegios por estar ahí.\n\nDe ahí salió **Token Gated Access**. Poner una barrera entre un contenido premium y tu comunidad. **Eliminando por completo la necesidad de acceder con una contraseña**.\n\n[https://forefront.market/blog/guest-david-token-ownership](https://forefront.market/blog/guest-david-token-ownership)\n\n### Pero, ¿que es token gating?\n\nLa definición más simple es **restringir** el **acceso** a **contenido exclusivo** exigiendo a los miembros de una comunidad que **adquieran un NFT o número de tokens específico**.\n\nEl token actúa como **clave de acceso** que se verifica conectando la wallet.\n\n¿Cuál es ese contenido que necesita \"protección\"? En realidad, cualquier contenido digital, desde un sitio web, contenidos exclusivos, chats privados en Discord hasta eventos virtuales en Decentraland.\n\nLo hemos visto en plataformas como [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/), donde miembros pagan una suscripción por acceder a contenido exclusivo. ¿Pero, y si le **damos la vuelta** a eso y **pagas una entrada, una vez, y accedes para siempre**? Las principales características de token gating son:\n\n* **Acceso**: tanto ha contenido como un grupo de chat\n* **Seguridad**: no se puede acceder con una pestaña en oculto o compartir externamente. Solo aquellos que tengan los tokens pueden visualizar.\n* **Utilidad**: el token es solo la puerta de entrada, puedes monetizar o dar perks en una comunidad\n\nToken gating permite a las comunidades beneficiarse del control de quién tiene acceso a sus contenidos. Puedes **crear diferentes rangos** y dar **beneficios** a aquellos que **contribuyen**.\n\nEl acceso con token es una forma de **mejorar la seguridad**. Solo se puede acceder a los datos almacenados mediante token gating una vez que el usuario ha demostrado su **identidad**. Por lo tanto, token gating es una puerta perfecta para crear **sistemas de verificación de varios niveles**. Pasamos de solo acceder a contenido a proteger páginas webs. Un [A/B test](https://vwo.com/es/ab-testing/), donde aquellos que tengan 100 tokens ven algo diferente de aquellos que solo tengan un NFT.\n\nEste nuevo mecanismo para **monetizar el contenido o el acceso** viene con varios beneficios para los creadores y los miembros, no solo alineando los incentivos, sino también convirtiendo los servicios y productos en activos que puedes tener ownership sobre ello y venderlo. **Ya no es solo una contraseña, sino un activo digital.**\n\nEl token gating es una forma de **añadir más valor a un token**, permitiendo al titular el acceso exclusivo a una comunidad, contenido o incluso productos físicos además del token. **Una contraseña con beneficios**. \n\n### Casos de uso\n\nPara [crear](https://medium.com/mintgate/announcing-token-protected-pages-23d917c37727) un **token gated access**, se necesitaban 3 pasos; el contenido que quieres proteger, con que token, y el mínimo requerido. Si era una colección de NFTs, podías hasta indicar unos ID específicos (solo el BAYC 2121, 3131 y 4141).\n\nUno de los primeros casos de uso que tuvimos fue una [página web](https://jnryfirst.com/firstaudio) con [$FIRST](https://twitter.com/harrisonfirst?s=20&t=Acv6zJNdotZ39aJpxuH23A) donde los miembros de la comunidad tenían acceso exclusivo a contenido de audio para usar en sus NFTs. De ahí empezamos a **tokenizar** **acceso** a una **playlist de Spotify, un artículo, videos o documentos en Google Drive para DAOs**. Desde que lanzamos nuestra plataforma, hemos tenido mas de **27.300 miembros** utilizando token gated links.\n\n**La utilidad es abierta** al creador o a la comunidad, **no hay límites**, cualquier contenido digital, se puede proteger y encriptar con un token, dando **seguridad a los miembros** y haciendo que el contenido sea **únicamente exclusivo para ellos**. Nosotros pusimos una herramienta sencilla, ellos crearon acceso a:\n\n* Trabajo (**Calendly, Zoom, Google Drive, Dropbox**)\n* IRL meet (**Formularios, RSVP, Tickets**)\n* Video (**Youtube, Vimeo**)\n* Música (**Spotify, SoundCloud, Audius**)\n* Web (**Dominio propio, Shopify**)\n\n![Experiencia token gated con los Golden State Warriors](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QsSTvq8joeQNyJspiHfLx.jpeg?height=694&width=1400)\n\nEn cuanto a comunidad, destacaría [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/). Es la **comunidad por referencia** en el ecosistema de social tokens. Hogar de muchas subculturas, FWB existe como un ecosistema de relaciones, un estudio creativo descentralizado y un grupo de chat interminable. Para leer su newsletter o acceder al discord necesitas tener una **cantidad mínima de tokens**.\n\n[Stoner Cats](https://www.stonercats.com/), fue sin duda un **siguiente paso en token gating**, creando una serie de animación para adultos (creada por Mila Kunis y Ashton Kutcher). Para poder ver cada nuevo episodio de la serie, es necesario **ser titular de uno de los NFT** de Stoner Cats.\n\nLos servicios token gated son especialmente **importantes** para los **creadores** y/o **marcas**, ya que les permiten centrarse en **ofrecer un buen servicio**, encontrar usuarios que quieran ese servicio, y centrarse en a**portar valor al usuario**. Esto es bueno para los usuarios, porque pueden **pagar menos y tener una mejor experiencia**. Es bueno para los creadores, porque pueden mantener sus negocios y **generar nuevas vías de monetización** al mismo tiempo, **creando una comunidad**. \n\nEs un nuevo modelo para **crear una comunidad fiel** y darles **beneficios** por formar parte de ella. Hasta **Shopify** ha introducido **Tokengated Experiences** hace unas semanas:\n\n[https://twitter.com/Shopify/status/1539610296200974338?s=20&t=LmgxEjqE4JFH2ZbfGTGLZw](https://twitter.com/Shopify/status/1539610296200974338?s=20&t=LmgxEjqE4JFH2ZbfGTGLZw)\n\n### Más allá de un acceso restringido\n\nRealmente, podemos ir más allá con gated access, no tiene que quedarse en un link, es difícil de distribuir y no es tan fácil monetizar de una manera directa. **Utilizarlo más allá de un sistema de verificación, implementando-lo directamente en un NFT**. Dar v**alor intrínseco** al token añadiendo contenido restringido.\n\nUn contenido exclusivo incrementa su valor en forma de NFT, pudiéndose vender directamente a una audiencia conservando todo el valor. Es como Patreon pero sin la plataforma, porque el **contenido puede vivir en cualquier lugar**. Es agnóstico a una plataforma, el contenido estará donde tú elijas.\n\n**Token gating es una forma de sobrecargar un NFT**, lo que otorga más valor a su propiedad. Además de poseer el contenido de un video NFT, eBook NFT, Ticket NFT o Link NFT, también puede garantizar que **solo sus propietarios puedan acceder** a ese contenido. Un ejemplo de ello fue mi presentación en ETHBarcelona, al acabar, todo el mundo que coleccionaba [mi NFT](https://tomu.mintgate.io/projects/cultura-tokenizada) tenia mi ppt gated, las diapositivas presentadas. Ese NFT no se ha quedado ahí, cualquiera que lo coleccione **tendrá acceso exclusivo a futuro contenido**. \n\nConvertir el contenido en un asset digital significa que se convierte en algo que el propietario puede revender. **No puedo revender mi suscripción**, pero puedo **revender un video NFT** que compré la semana pasada por más de lo que me costó, o incluso **prestarlo** mientras voy **generando un ingreso pasivo**.\n\n### Comunidades web3\n\nEsto es lo que hizo que toda comunidad tokenizada **tenga un sitio** donde **compartir** información, tener un chat protegido solo para aquellos que tienen un **token en particular**. Hace dos veranos fue cuando [Collab.land](https://collab.land/) surgió y domino los grupos de chat tanto en Telegram como en Discord. Cualquiera integraba sus servicios para crear un **canal exclusivo para holders**. Desde esos momentos, donde Collab.land se enfocaba en **chat** y MintGate en **contenido digital**, hemos visto que más y más plataformas han salido construyendo en este vertical. Si tengo que destacar dos de ellos, sin duda son:\n\n* [Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com/) - Control de acceso descentralizado para aplicaciones web3 y datos privados en un Internet abierto.\n* [Guild](https://guild.xyz/) - ‘Token-enabled membership’. Puedes crear niveles exclusivos en tu comunidad y administrarlos con diferentes tokens.\n\nAhora, ya nos **comunicamos** con gente que tiene el **mismo token**. O incluso, [lensfrens](https://www.lensfrens.xyz/) te enseña a quien seguir en base a tu huella en web3, en base a aquello que compartes con esa persona desde un punto de vista de token. **Conecta tu wallet, y descubres a qué comunidad perteneces**:\n\n* [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/) - una comunidad para cada token. Commonwealth es una plataforma todo en uno para que las comunidades discutan, voten y financien proyectos de manera colectiva.\n* [Backdrop](https://backdrop.so/)- ayudan a todo el mundo a participar en las comunidades tokenizadas de la web3. La verdad, perdemos demasiado tiempo en discord, esta es la manera de estar pendiente de todo lo que ocurre y dónde contribuir.\n\nYa no necesitamos generar 100 contraseñas para todas las páginas webs o apps que accedemos, ahora nos **conectamos** con **nuestra wallet** y **descubrimos** un n**uevo mundo**. Podemos diseñar comunidades más fieles, enfocadas en 100 fans que de verdad quieran contribuir y formar parte de **algo exclusivo**. \n\nUn token hace que decidamos donde **comunicarnos** con nuestra comunidad, darles la oportunidad de **participar** en el contenido, no depender de una plataforma y ofrecerles una **experiencia única**.\n\nTodo está ahí, a un clic de generar una nueva experiencia, una experiencia única, una **experiencia token gated**.", "timestamp": 1658152110, "digest": "_0tAHc17rzRtQ4qdoxmcP041yugSG05iz3Prqoqi-Hs", "contributor": "0x98397A068d413D3C92A506f98c5F25D33A9DAc14"}

Un [A/B test](https://vwo.com/es/ab-testing/), donde aquellos que tengan 100 tokens ven algo diferente de aquellos que solo tengan un NFT.\n\nEste nuevo mecanismo para **monetizar el contenido o el acceso** viene con varios beneficios para los creadores y los miembros, no solo alineando los incentivos, sino también convirtiendo los servicios y productos en activos que puedes tener ownership sobre ello y venderlo. **Ya no es solo una contraseña, sino un activo digital.**\n\nEl token gating es una forma de **añadir más valor a un token**, permitiendo al titular el acceso exclusivo a una comunidad, contenido o incluso productos físicos además del token. **Una contraseña con beneficios**. \n\n### Casos de uso\n\nPara [crear](https://medium.com/mintgate/announcing-token-protected-pages-23d917c37727) un **token gated access**, se necesitaban 3 pasos; el contenido que quieres proteger, con que token, y el mínimo requerido. Si era una colección de NFTs, podías hasta indicar unos ID específicos (solo el BAYC 2121, 3131 y 4141).\n\nUno de los primeros casos de uso que tuvimos fue una [página web](https://jnryfirst.com/firstaudio) con [$FIRST](https://twitter.com/harrisonfirst?s=20&t=Acv6zJNdotZ39aJpxuH23A) donde los miembros de la comunidad tenían acceso exclusivo a contenido de audio para usar en sus NFTs. De ahí empezamos a **tokenizar** **acceso** a una **playlist de Spotify, un artículo, videos o documentos en Google Drive para DAOs**. Desde que lanzamos nuestra plataforma, hemos tenido mas de **27.300 miembros** utilizando token gated links.\n\n**La utilidad es abierta** al creador o a la comunidad, **no hay límites**, cualquier contenido digital, se puede proteger y encriptar con un token, dando **seguridad a los miembros** y haciendo que el contenido sea **únicamente exclusivo para ellos**. Nosotros pusimos una herramienta sencilla, ellos crearon acceso a:\n\n* Trabajo (**Calendly, Zoom, Google Drive, Dropbox**)\n* IRL meet (**Formularios, RSVP, Tickets**)\n* Video (**Youtube, Vimeo**)\n* Música (**Spotify, SoundCloud, Audius**)\n* Web (**Dominio propio, Shopify**)\n\n![Experiencia token gated con los Golden State Warriors](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QsSTvq8joeQNyJspiHfLx.jpeg?height=694&width=1400)\n\nEn cuanto a comunidad, destacaría [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/). Es la **comunidad por referencia** en el ecosistema de social tokens. Hogar de muchas subculturas, FWB existe como un ecosistema de relaciones, un estudio creativo descentralizado y un grupo de chat interminable. Para leer su newsletter o acceder al discord necesitas tener una **cantidad mínima de tokens**.\n\n[Stoner Cats](https://www.stonercats.com/), fue sin duda un **siguiente paso en token gating**, creando una serie de animación para adultos (creada por Mila Kunis y Ashton Kutcher). Para poder ver cada nuevo episodio de la serie, es necesario **ser titular de uno de los NFT** de Stoner Cats.\n\nLos servicios token gated son especialmente **importantes** para los **creadores** y/o **marcas**, ya que les permiten centrarse en **ofrecer un buen servicio**, encontrar usuarios que quieran ese servicio, y centrarse en a**portar valor al usuario**. Esto es bueno para los usuarios, porque pueden **pagar menos y tener una mejor experiencia**. Es bueno para los creadores, porque pueden mantener sus negocios y **generar nuevas vías de monetización** al mismo tiempo, **creando una comunidad**. \n\nEs un nuevo modelo para **crear una comunidad fiel** y darles **beneficios** por formar parte de ella. Hasta **Shopify** ha introducido **Tokengated Experiences** hace unas semanas:\n\n[https://twitter.com/Shopify/status/1539610296200974338?s=20&t=LmgxEjqE4JFH2ZbfGTGLZw](https://twitter.com/Shopify/status/1539610296200974338?s=20&t=LmgxEjqE4JFH2ZbfGTGLZw)\n\n### Más allá de un acceso restringido\n\nRealmente, podemos ir más allá con gated access, no tiene que quedarse en un link, es difícil de distribuir y no es tan fácil monetizar de una manera directa. **Utilizarlo más allá de un sistema de verificación, implementando-lo directamente en un NFT**. Dar v**alor intrínseco** al token añadiendo contenido restringido.\n\nUn contenido exclusivo incrementa su valor en forma de NFT, pudiéndose vender directamente a una audiencia conservando todo el valor. Es como Patreon pero sin la plataforma, porque el **contenido puede vivir en cualquier lugar**. Es agnóstico a una plataforma, el contenido estará donde tú elijas.\n\n**Token gating es una forma de sobrecargar un NFT**, lo que otorga más valor a su propiedad. Además de poseer el contenido de un video NFT, eBook NFT, Ticket NFT o Link NFT, también puede garantizar que **solo sus propietarios puedan acceder** a ese contenido. Un ejemplo de ello fue mi presentación en ETHBarcelona, al acabar, todo el mundo que coleccionaba [mi NFT](https://tomu.mintgate.io/projects/cultura-tokenizada) tenia mi ppt gated, las diapositivas presentadas. Ese NFT no se ha quedado ahí, cualquiera que lo coleccione **tendrá acceso exclusivo a futuro contenido**. \n\nConvertir el contenido en un asset digital significa que se convierte en algo que el propietario puede revender. **No puedo revender mi suscripción**, pero puedo **revender un video NFT** que compré la semana pasada por más de lo que me costó, o incluso **prestarlo** mientras voy **generando un ingreso pasivo**.\n\n### Comunidades web3\n\nEsto es lo que hizo que toda comunidad tokenizada **tenga un sitio** donde **compartir** información, tener un chat protegido solo para aquellos que tienen un **token en particular**. Hace dos veranos fue cuando [Collab.land](https://collab.land/) surgió y domino los grupos de chat tanto en Telegram como en Discord. Cualquiera integraba sus servicios para crear un **canal exclusivo para holders**. Desde esos momentos, donde Collab.land se enfocaba en **chat** y MintGate en **contenido digital**, hemos visto que más y más plataformas han salido construyendo en este vertical. Si tengo que destacar dos de ellos, sin duda son:\n\n* [Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com/) - Control de acceso descentralizado para aplicaciones web3 y datos privados en un Internet abierto.\n* [Guild](https://guild.xyz/) - ‘Token-enabled membership’. Puedes crear niveles exclusivos en tu comunidad y administrarlos con diferentes tokens.\n\nAhora, ya nos **comunicamos** con gente que tiene el **mismo token**. O incluso, [lensfrens](https://www.lensfrens.xyz/) te enseña a quien seguir en base a tu huella en web3, en base a aquello que compartes con esa persona desde un punto de vista de token. **Conecta tu wallet, y descubres a qué comunidad perteneces**:\n\n* [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/) - una comunidad para cada token. Commonwealth es una plataforma todo en uno para que las comunidades discutan, voten y financien proyectos de manera colectiva.\n* [Backdrop](https://backdrop.so/)- ayudan a todo el mundo a participar en las comunidades tokenizadas de la web3. La verdad, perdemos demasiado tiempo en discord, esta es la manera de estar pendiente de todo lo que ocurre y dónde contribuir.\n\nYa no necesitamos generar 100 contraseñas para todas las páginas webs o apps que accedemos, ahora nos **conectamos** con **nuestra wallet** y **descubrimos** un n**uevo mundo**. Podemos diseñar comunidades más fieles, enfocadas en 100 fans que de verdad quieran contribuir y formar parte de **algo exclusivo**. \n\nUn token hace que decidamos donde **comunicarnos** con nuestra comunidad, darles la oportunidad de **participar** en el contenido, no depender de una plataforma y ofrecerles una **experiencia única**.\n\nTodo está ahí, a un clic de generar una nueva experiencia, una experiencia única, una **experiencia token gated**.", "timestamp": 1658152483, "digest": "JcObSsvZLUnM4L7MdP4ibMQGr7farY9y4IhlcZkzHSE", "contributor": "0x98397A068d413D3C92A506f98c5F25D33A9DAc14"}

OTC交易返点：持有一定数量的FTT的持币人，可以收到OTC交易返点。（FTX的OTC交易没有手续费。）\n5. OTC交易回购：FTX会根据OTC的交易额和收入进行一定程度的FTT回购和销毁。\n6. 持币用户分成：FTT的后台测试及上线模拟环境显示，在较大行情期间，FTT的风险保证金呈净增长，没有产生过分摊；部分风险准备金的净收入将作为分成给到FTT持有者。\n\n独特的模式：\nFTT 质押\n\n质押FTT将享有以下权益：\n增加邀请返佣比例: 通过质押FTT，邀请人将得到更高的返佣比例\n挂单手续费奖励: FTT质押者将获得挂单手续费奖励（原有的FTT手续费折扣会保持)\n额外投票权: 质押FTT将获得额外的投票权益 标准投票数量, 基于FTT持有数量和30天交易量决定)\n空投额外奖励: 质押FTT将获得更多的SRM空投（以及获得未来可能出现的其它空投奖励）\n免收区块链费用:持股人每天可以免费获得ERC20和ETH提款\n\nToken：ftt\n\n发行总量：335,165,027\n流通总量：139,295,691\n\n团队：FTT的团队阵容强大，创始人SBF被评为币圈最有影响力的30人之一，Mit物理系毕业。SBF本人作为90后业内的领军者本身对ftt就有着强大的加持。\n\n今年 4 月，SBF发推表示FTX交易量在去年一年上涨了8000%，在所有交易平台中增速最快。目前，FTX总体交易量位于行业第四，其中，衍生品依然是FTX的业务支柱。\n\n风险：庄家大户控盘比较严重，运营思路明确，所以操盘性质也十分明显。\n\n消息面评估：FTT DAO从Sam Bankman-Fried粉丝社区完成700万美元融资。该基金将为去中心化金融和加密教育领域的社区主导项目做出贡献。\n\nFtx和monumental\n\nSos\n\n基本面：\nOpensea作为全球最大的nft交易平台一直没有发放自己的代币，这其实引起了一些投资者的不满，这时openDAO的组织宣布发放代币SOS，并会以空投的形势发放给opensea用户，这是币圈一个全新的DAO形势，你不发放代币我直接DAO帮你发币，只要是在opensea做过交易的，它都会基于交易量像你的账户空投代币，\n\nToken：SOS\n\n代币分配： 50%用于空投opensea用户\n20%质押奖励\n20%社区基金\n10%lp奖励\n\n风险：典型看手速与判断的项目，早期介入可以赚得盆满钵满，三大上线基本属于买在山顶，极容易被割，以最近热点DAO宣传项目，却没有实际的应用价值。\n\nFTM\n\n基本面：\n\nFantom是一个高度可扩展的区块链平台，基于DAG（有向无环图分布式数据库）技术支持智能合约，适用于DeFi、cryptodApp、以及企业解决方案，意在通过使用Lachesis协议来突破“老牌”区块链设置的限制，与其它公链最大的区别，在于DAG技术带来的交易数据存储方式改变。\n\n在Fantom中，每一笔交易信息都可以生成单独的单元，单元和单元之间只需要进行相互任意连接验证，不用像一般区块链要把交易合并打包出块才算是完成交易，因而提高了交易并发量，实现了即时交易。\n\n同时，由于Fantom能够兼容以太坊EVM虚拟机，以太坊的DeFi应用可以一键平移到该公链上，享受该公链的低费率和高速交易。\n\nFantom通过桥接将各种链纳入其网络，例如以太坊、BSC、Polygon和Avalanche，以顺应未来的多链趋势。目前，SushiSwap和Curve等主要的以太坊项目都迁移到了Fantom，流量也一道引入。\n\n10月伊始，Fantom各项指标开始呈现快速增长态势。根据CoinMarketCap数据显示，Fantom的原生代币FTM年内涨幅已经超过12664%，即近乎130倍增长，排名目前位于第35位；根据DefiLlama数据显示，Fantom上DeFi的总锁定价值（TVL）约为98亿美元，较8月底的5亿美元增长近20倍。\n\n值得一提的是，Fantom还发布了针对数字人民币的CBDC解决方案，还宣布与塔吉克斯坦规模最大的银行之一OJSCOrienbank合作，为塔吉克斯坦建立中央银行数字货币（CBDC）系统，可见其在CBDC领域的雄心壮志。\n\n核心业务：\n比特币、以太坊等传统公链存在的一个问题是：节点越多，去中心化程度越高，但速度和扩展性也越差，而DAG则刚好相反，简单来说就是越多节点加入，速度就越快，扩展性也会变得无限大。\n\n实际上，曾经EOS、TRX等明星公链也曾尝试解决区块链不可能三角问题，但实际效果差强人意。例如号称百万TPS的EOS实测不过几千，并且安全性奇差，成为市场名头最响、表现最差的公链。\n\n而许多新型公链也尝试解决这个问题，例如主打金融公链的雪崩协议、开放网络NEAR等等，Fantom则采用了一种名为DAG的技术解决这个问题。\n\n融资情况：\n\nFantom团队的创新方案得到众多投资机构的支持，比如BlockVC、BlockCrafters、JRRCrypto、CryptoBazzar、连接资本、ZoraxCapital、TransferenceFund、节点资本、NirvanaCapital、DFund基金、丹华资本、回向区块链基金等。\n\n实际上，在创立不久的2018年上半年，Fantom就完成了预定的代币总供应量的40%的代币销售，通过种子轮以及两轮私募共筹集到4000万美元，投资方包括：\n\nHyperchainCapital、SignumCapital、8Decimal、ArringtonXRPCapital、BiboxFund、LinkVC、NirvanaCapital、JRRCrypto、BlockVC、中国私募股权基金九鼎投资（JDCapital）、KosmosCapital、Lemniscap、回向区块链基金（TransferenceBlockchainFund）等。\n\n在完成私募后，Fantom又通过公开销售筹集到265万美元。\n\n团队：Fantom最初由韩国开发者ByungIkAhn于2018年1月创立，官网列出的27位团队成员信息中，位于澳大利亚悉尼的MichaelKong现担任首席执行官兼首席信息官，其他成员包括工程师、科学家、研究人员、设计师和企业家。\n\nToken：FTM代币：总发行量为31.7亿枚，目前流通超过20亿+，目前，FTM 可用作原生主网代币、ERC-20 代币和 BEP-2 代币。", "timestamp": 1658152830, "digest": "3qRvY9oBiM8aQFPWVCLX2m6VSSGTIXGId86Mh2RYSKY", "contributor": "0x97d2F391Ef469b556eA0EAbeb44E3d89DC58458F"}

Also, the content is ours, not mirror's, and they use decentralized servers like Arweave (which I'll talk about later) so that the information is eternal.\n\n**Lens Protocol**: This project is focused on identity, data portability and the social. They created the social layer 0 that allows developers to invent applications that run on this blockchain/protocol and that, for example, we can switch between applications while maintaining full control of our preferences, privacy, and our connections (friends). The next Twitter, Instagram or Facebook will be built on Lens, but unlike current business models, they will not be able to exploit our information for advertising or invent vicious algorithms to keep us looking at the screen.\n\nI talk more about Lens in my other note on identity.\n\n**BAT**: Basic Attention Token is an initiative of the Brave browser that was invented by Brendan Eich who is none other than the inventor of JavaScript, Mozilla and Firefox. Brave is a browser that blocks all third-party cookies (Google Ads, etc.) that spy on our behavior in order to offer us invasive advertising. By blocking all tracheas we become invisible to corporations that want to exploit our information, and on top of that browsing is faster because you don't have to load all the JavaScript for these cookies.\n\nBut in order not to leave advertisers out, Brave offers incentives in the BAT token for those who wish to receive advertising voluntarily, let's say. So you browse, you are aware that you are giving information to advertisers and in exchange for that, you receive advertising. A win-win, or at least a fairer, logical and less extractive way. At least we get something.\n\n**OpenSea**: OpenSea is the leading marketplace for NFT exchanges. It is the easiest to understand what it is for because it is as if it were an Amazon or MercadoLibre, something that already exists, but unlike web2 marketplaces, OpenSea publishes the content of our wallets, it does not own our information. We can choose to publish them on OpenSea or quickly go to a competitor. It is as if we had an NFT of our MercadoLibre publications and we could change the platform whenever we wanted.\n\nGiven the portability of the data, OpenSea is open source, since it does not gain anything by not being open source, on the contrary, it is a competitive advantage to be open source in crypto rather than not. If you are open source and open, others can join you, allowing you to maintain your leadership position. OpenSea charges 2.5% also because it is what the market allows, otherwise a competitor that charges less can easily appear.\n\n**Arweave**: It is a network similar to IPFS+Filecoin, but under this system eternal storage is guaranteed. Due to the logic of this blockchain, the miners who receive the $AR (Arweave) token must be able to demonstrate access to random content/file at all times in order to validate new transactions. This forces the miners to continue to keep copies of the old files because otherwise they cannot continue mining.\n\nI talk more about decentralized storage in this note\n\n**ENS**: Ethereum Name Service is like a router from blockchain addresses (wallets) to names in text format, with .eth at the end. The project lets you register a domain, like a .com, but an .eth, and assign the wallet to which it corresponds. More similar to how an alias works, but this alias is yours and you can assign the wallet you need to it.\n\nENS is also an open-source protocol and is run entirely by the ENS DAO where every change or improvement is voted on. The domains have an annual cost, but they do this so that no one abuses the system and that those who use it have the opportunity to use them. Also everything generated is donated to charity, so ENS is a non-profit organization.\n\n**Metamask**:", "timestamp": 1658152956, "digest": "V-0vmCNAebsyV4YbvznnNFNjwbAO_ZwqAmj7-DftKko", "contributor": "0x7E0b0363404751346930AF92C80D1fef932Cc48a"}

Hunting the darkhorses of the Crypto world.**\n\n# 概要：\n\n* 本周CPI大幅超越预期，市场一度认为会加息100BP，美联储及美国政府及时放风加息75BP稳住了市场预期，美股和币市迎来了大幅反弹，并可能持续到加息后，转为中期反弹行情。\n* 油价虽大幅下跌，但因增产无望，可能还是高位震荡，所以CPI即使已经见顶回落，但恐怕也难以有较大的降低，但毕竟给了市场一个喘息的机会，可以暂时放下加息压力。\n* 同时市场有人预测，美联储将在年底前结束加息，并转为重新宽松，否则美国无力承担，这将有利于风险资产上涨。\n* BTC、ETH带动市场大幅反弹，价值山寨币将获得难得的交易机会，不要错过。\n\n# 0、本周市场重大事件\n\n### 宏观经济与政策\n\n* 本周公布6月份CPI 9.1%，超过预期值8.8%，创40年新高，核心CPI 5.9%，前值6%，并未新高，随后美股开盘大跌；然后拜登表示，油价已下降，CPI已过时；本周油价最低90，收盘在100，预示着7月CPI将会回落；本周美元指数再创新高触及109，主要因日元和欧元下跌。\n* CPI超预期导致市场猜测可能会加息100BP，随后美联储通过多个渠道发布消息，加息75BP，市场闻讯大幅反弹；另外周五美零售销售数据和密歇根消费者信心指数均好于预期，打消了市场衰退担忧，有助于美股反弹，且传统行业好于科技行业。\n* 拜登与沙特未达成石油增产协议，油价恐怕还要继续维持高位，通胀可能已经到顶，但明显下降也难。\n* 但市场也有不同声音：宏观数据分析公司Forest For The Trees的CEO Luke Gromen认为，美联储将在未来3个月结束加息并重回量化宽松政策，而欧美将在未来5-10年迎来持续的高通胀；如果继续加息，美债利息将继续增加，而受加息影响GDP将降低，并导致税收减少，美国财政更无力负担利息，债务/GDP将很快到达130%的风险线；冬季俄罗斯能源对欧日更是不可替代的，加重西方国家压力；没有唯一的选择就是重新宽松，避免美债违约。而黄金和比特币将脱离美股走强；[原文链接](https://www.theblockbeats.info/news/31277)。\n* BIMEX创始人Arthur Hayes表示，预测美联储将再次向金融市场注入数万亿美元，增加市场流动性，将带动加密货币在内的风险资产触底反弹，正密切关注日欧元走势。\n* 据coinHub推文，美国国土安全部成员在SEC会议上表示，美国政府知道谁是中本聪，是一个4人团队。可信度恐怕不高。\n* 美联储沃勒表示，去中心化金融最终可能会改变传统金融市场，催化了DeFi的反弹。\n\n### 传统资本\n\n* 纽约洋基棒球队允许员工将部分薪资转为比特币。\n* 清崎表示，正持有现金等待买入比特币。\n* 贝莱德CEO表示，公司的机构投资者对加密货币有更多兴趣。\n\n### Crypto新闻事件\n\n* 摩根大通表示，比特币的电力成本已从6月初的24000美元降低至了现在的约13000美元，主要是矿工部署了更多高效率的矿机。受Celsius破产影响，比特币矿机价格跌至2020年以来低点。\n* 以太坊合并预计在9月19日实施，将减产90%，考虑燃烧消耗可能进入通缩，预测质押率从10%提高到30%，受此影响ETH大涨，相关Staking赛道项目LDO、SSV涨幅更大。\n* Celsius宣布破产，因Terra、3AC等坏账导致亏空12亿美元，十万用户受损。\n* AEX暂停平台所有业务，全力配合警方调查。\n* 币安发布五周年公开信，有客户1.2亿，希望成为Web3门户，为数十亿人迈入加密新世界的第一步的工具集；币安报告显示，截止6月有1551款加密游戏。\n\n### Glassnode周报概要\n\n* 今年的2.9万美元相当于2018年的6000美元，而近期的17600美元低点相当于2018年的3000美元；\n* 2018年大批买家在6000美元买入，而被迫在3000美元的底部卖出，完成最终的换手；今年同样大批买家在3W买入，而在近期的2W区域卖出，又一次财富再分配完成；\n* 长期持有者卖出利润率（LTH-SOPR）为0.67，即亏损33%卖出；长期持有者持有成本相比现价浮亏14%；前者＞后者说明目前投降卖出者以2020年以后买入者为主，而2020年以前更老的HODL并未卖出；而历史上此两指标同时出现亏损的持续时间，2014年熊市为11个月，2018年熊市为6个月，（参照此前比例推算，此次持续时间可能是3个月）；\n* 熊市的底部就是比特币从信念薄弱者转移到坚定信仰者的过程；而目前刚买入的比特币正在从短期持有转为长期持有；\n* 鉴于成本支出压力，矿工们正在投降加快卖出比特币，已持续1个月，2018年底矿工投降时间持续4个月。\n*

\\~一年以上持有量占比：64.88%\n\n* 本周本指标几乎无波动。\n\n### \\~储备风险Reserve Risk：0.00109\n\n* 本指标又反弹回0.001，上周创历史新低。\n\n### 1.1.2、BTC中长期指标\n\n### \\~200周均线：跌破\n\n* 跌破200周均线，堪比历史上历次熊市大底。\n\n### \\~已实现价格：跌破\n\n* 自6月13日跌破已实现价格以来，到7月18日第一次站上已实现价格，共在其下34天。2018年底熊市为136天，312为7天。\n* 已实现价格=所有的币最后一次移动时的市值总和/当前流通总市值，即可视为所有币的平均成本，包含最远古几乎零成本的币，所以当币价跌破已实现价格时，说明币价严重低估，如果价格可以站稳则这次加仓良机已经过去。\n\n### \\~Ahr999囤币&x指数：0.326，抄底区间\n\n* 囤币指数本次下跌最低点0.24，2018年大底极值0.26，312时极值0.2。\n* 目前0.326，低于0.45，依然处于抄底区间。\n\n### \\~2-Year乘数通道：大幅跌破\n\n* 大幅跌破2-Year乘数通道，堪比2018年底和312。\n\n### \\~梅耶倍数（Mayer Multiple）：反弹出超卖价\n\n* 本轮下跌极限低值0.478，超过2018年和312。\n* 目前0.585，刚反弹会0.55以上，从市场超卖状态进入看跌通道。\n\n### \\~公允价值偏差量（MVRV Z-Score）：-0.119\n\n* 本轮最低-0.195，低于0.3即为严重低估，2018年极值-0.5，312极值-0.26。\n* 目前-0.119，依然处于严重低估状态。\n\n### \\~交易所余额及占比：有所增加\n\n* 根据链数查数据，本周CEX余额由12.48%增加到12.56%，增加15570枚，随12日开始的反弹而增加。\n\n## 1.2、短期指标及期货市场数据\n\n### \\~恐慌贪婪指数：15\\~24\n\n* 本周恐慌指数为15\\~24，终于全周都在15以上，但还在24以下，依然处于严重恐慌状态。\n* 从5月9日跌到15以下，到7月5日回到15以上，连续达57天，超过历史上历次熊市底部。\n\n### \\~期货资金费率：低正值\n\n* 本周资金费率，全部为正，但数值不大，在零附近波动。\n\n### \\~期货持仓量：小幅增加\n\n* BTC合约，小幅增加；ETH合约，增加略大些。\n\n### \\~期货爆仓量：略大，ETH空头为主\n\n* 本周ETH行情波动较大，爆仓以ETH空头为主。\n\n### \\~期货多空比：总体维持平衡\n\n### \\~期货成交量：略微放大\n\n### \\~看跌/看涨期权：BTC 0.61，ETH 0.32\n\n* ＜1，表示看跌为主，＞1，表明看涨为主，数值偏离1越大，表明倾向性越强；\n* 此数值表明看涨ETH的意愿强于BTC。\n\n## 1.3、BTC走势分析及总结\n\n* 本周行情小幅波动，开盘价20846，最低点18900，最高点21665，收盘价20793，周中公布了超预期高的CPI后，市场短暂下跌，而后开始了4天的反弹行情，表明市场对CPI数据已经开始免疫，目前价格对超高通胀及预期的加息已经Price in。\n* 从周线看，目前依然受制于周线MA200，从目前美联储观察数据可以看出，7月27日加息75BP是大概率，则比特币有望跟随美股反弹站上MA200，按本周收盘价MA200=22630。\n\n## 1.4、全市场分析\n\n### \\~全市场周数据\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gSRLl4yGlRBR2uRE--I99.png?height=334&width=678)\n\n* 因ETH2.0将于9月10日合并利好影响，ETH一枝独秀，大涨15%，而BTC和其他ALT基本未动，并导致市占率BTCDOM下降。\n\n# 2、关注ALT项目\n\n## 2.1、Top20手续费收入排行\n\n* 综合考虑Crypto Fees及Token Terminal的数据做如下分析，因部分协议的收入未明确归属TokenHolders，所以后两者有所差别。\n* 收入较高，增长教明显的协议为UNI、dYdX、LDO、SNX、AAVE、LOOKS、GMX、ENS、CRV、HNT。\n* UNI也受益ETH利好，且将推出NFT市场，近期Uniswap日平均交易费超过ETH网络，并上线Robinhood。\n* LDO直接受益于ETH合并预期利好，收入大增；dYdX、SNX、GMX、AAVE、LOOKS的收入较大比例归属TokenHolders，受益更加明显。\n* AAVE新提案与BAL交换20万枚BAL。\n\n### Crypto Fees数据\n\n![资源来源：Crypto fees](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uf5314dL5jOgJ0zQA5oFD.png?height=1060&width=1278)\n\n### 协议收入-来自Token Terminal数据\n\n![资源来源：token terminal](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/47dx1Ebt9sR_gi8-KPEOQ.png?height=545&width=1106)\n\n### TokenHolders的协议收入-来自Token Terminal数据\n\n![资源来源：token terminal](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l4zCbh-raf8HrCjgxeXwm.png?height=555&width=1100)\n\n## 2.2、公链生态\n\n* 本周公链生态最大利好就是明确ETH 2.0合并的时间为9月19日，合并后，通胀将实际变为通缩，并可能带动更多币加入POS节点，减少流通量。之前周报提过，本次大跌中ETH的链上清算可以类比312对于即将减半的BTC，达到了彻底洗盘的目的，可以更顺畅的基于利好而上涨。\n* 受此消息带动staking赛事的LDO、SSV暴涨，220403周报曾对此有过分析，可以参考；OP、MATIC也跟随大涨。\n* MATIC最近的建设比较积极，如收购和合作推进，并将于7月21日推出zkEVM，为开发者和用户提供EVM等效解决方案、高性能zk证明机制（zk-proofs）与以太坊主网级别的安全性。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X_4czWsSInbkt7BMb498b.png?height=496&width=1106)\n\n##

{"id": "jbG3WEZ7fgHDvLNi_CVeoZJCXfqTBRFgG6WCBh3j6K4", "title": "Web3 academy", "body": "“The age of Web3 is coming!”, “The Web3 arms race is upon us”. These are just few of the headlines that came along in 2022 so far. Is this just a new hype that has been unleashed or could Web3 really become a technology revolution? Via a series of articles, Tech Lab will explain more about Web3, what is it, how does it work, what can it do, and what are the main challenges ahead.\n\nSo, what is Web3? Let’s firsthave a look at Web2. Because if there is a Web3, there must be a Web2, right? Web2 is the internet as we know it today. One of the main characteristics of Web2 is that information, web applications, platforms and services are centralised. If we want to participate in the Web2 world, we are forced to share our data and identity with organisations like Meta and Google, with very little control over what happens with that data and identity. \n\nOne of the main tasks of Web3 is to shift the power over data and identity towards the owner or initiator of the data. By organising the internet in a decentralised way,data can be stored anywhere,also thanks to blockchain administering data control, ownership, as well asuring data privacy through encryption. This is why Web3 is also called decentralized internet or decentralized web. \n\nWhen you hear people talking about Web 3.0 (instead of Web3) they could also mean something else, namely the semantic web. Both Web3 and Web 3.0 want to offer an alternative to the current web,but they have a different focus. The semantic web (Web 3.0)focuses on efficiency and intelligence,and works by reusing and linking data across websites. The decentralized web (Web3)focuseson empowerment and security,by giving power over data and identity back to the people.\n\nSo, when you read something online about the subject, how can you really distinguish the two concepts? Well, apparently you cannot be 100% sure. The fact that there is still no consensus about the definition of Web3 is part of the challenge.

*为什么Web3应用程序无法形成飞轮效应滚滚向前？*\n>\n> *虽然有这么多灵魂拷问，但现实的情况却是几乎没人停下思考：理想的去中心化设计和现实的应用生态建设之间有怎样的鸿沟？*\n\nWeb3带给我们产业迭代、时代变迁乃至社会进化的宏大愿景，可谓一个伟大而冒险、自上而下的顶层社会变革设计。作为加密世界建构的思想图腾和行动纲要，Web3的去中心化社会理念具有革命性——过往社会变革往往是自上而下设计，并带来不断反复和冲突；在去中心化社会理念下，Web3的社会实践却呈现以自下而上“涌现”，类似蚁群或蜂巢的“自组织”系统。\n\n可是从现实层面来讲，Web3缺失落地实践的执行者和推动者。虽然任何一次与社会变革关联的重大技术都脱离不了市场、财富、利益的蕴化与赋能，但加密世界的发展史却完全被财富欲望所穿透，上至项目开发者、工作室、投资机构，下至投机者、hodler等所有加密生态主要参与者。\n\n以自下而上的Web3应用生态建设来支撑的产业迭代、时代变迁和社会进化，与加密世界币圈的各方利益博弈，让这一切陷入了“悖论”。\n\n### **VC：Web3背后的隐形推手**\n\n> 以Token之手，以建设为名\n\n现有互联网产业架构说到底还是“规模换增长，流量换估值”的线性关系；但Web 3不存在中心载体，不能用以往估值逻辑来评价投入产出比。Web 3所有的商业模型和产品设计都需要重构，由一个非线性关系来打破临界点，并达到相当规模的用户数量——这种模式可以类比于人类大脑通过各种神经突触相互链接，最终产生复杂思维。\n\n这种去中心化的重构代表个人与企业的分野将逐渐缩小，每个人、每个小微企业，甚至任何社会团体的商业价值都可以被挖掘（Token），被传输（Web 3社交），并且相互间的关系可迁移（社交图谱）、可存储（IPFS）。\n\n但是，现阶段Web 3.0存在的问题明显:\n\n**1. 缺乏真实使用需求挖掘：**\n\nWeb 3.0主要靠抄Web 2.0的创意，频繁推出各类中心化服务的去中心化版本，缺乏对用户真实需求的挖掘。比如，我们不是想要一个去中心化版的Twitter，我们只是想要一个能保留社交关系、内容可NFT化、平台抗审查，并且可以保护我们隐私的社交协议。\n\n**2. 用户以谋利为第一动力：**\n\n用户不是出于使用价值和真实场景使用产品，而是以谋利为目的，这也是X2E及其仿盘项目层出不穷的原因。但是这种模式只能在创业阶段吸引到淘金者，不会留下真实的用户群体。\n\n如果要坚定做多Web 3，没有长期投入无法看到回报，至少需要商业模型成型才可以得到果实。只有诞生出全民应用的时候，才是Web 3真正破局的时候。但我们不得不接受的现实是：DeFi用户大概400万人，NFT在OpenSea活跃用户约为50万，Web 3社交协议大概不到1万用户。\n\n为什么Web 3实际用户规模如此小——因为VC助推下的Token机制。\n\nVC在Web 2的逻辑是：持续投资，寻求单一赛道的垄断地位，占据全部市场空间，持续获得超额利润。\n\nVC在Web 3的逻辑是：以投资为筹码，寻求早期廉价Token，以二级市场为抛售地，以代币上交易所为节点，快速榨干token价值。\n\nWeb 3的Token机制成为机构和VC的蓄水池，并且不用负任何责任。这里存在一个Bug机制，让传统机构可以利用Token攻击套利。\n\n为什么Token机制无法带来实际用户规模？理性人认为：有些行为并不是在市场机制下的自发行为，恰恰是被人为干涉和创造出来的。\n\n用户使用搜索引擎，可能确实会在乎隐私、数据安全这些内容，但最重要的是满足对搜索的需求，这是Web 3建设路径不能等同于DeFi和NFT的根本原因，一个产品使用价值应该优先于价格机制。\n\n比如用户使用EthSign进行商业合同的签署，最看重的是合同的不可篡改性，这是Web 3产品优于其他工具的核心优势，用户完全不需要了解上链和智能合约意味著什么，但是可以知晓这可以让合同进行永久存档。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/f070d016203c45aae37b729920c6cedd.jpg)\n\n图源：EthSign\n\n众所周知，市场是基于个人利益最大化的基础去行动的，但目前的市场是基于他人的利益最大化在起舞——这根逗猫棒叫做Token。让我们用一张图片来看看这个Token加持下的演化流程。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/8600a98ddb3bb4bf75883719655b6846.jpg)\n\n机构谈好分成，项目方在内部回报率（IPR）的引诱下，双方合谋维持币价，牛市时会获得更多的用户支撑Token的价值，但一旦熊市由于项目缺乏核心用户会面临币价和用户的双重流失。\n\nToken被利用完毕之后，部分项目方会选择一起抛售，或者无可奈何维持运转，比如Uniswap在收购NFT聚合交易平台Genie以后，竟然以USDC作为回溯空投币种，而非使用Uni代币，可以宣告治理代币的事实性死亡。\n\n在中本聪的设想中，Token是工作量证明的一种表现形式。但是在VC的指挥下，项目的意义是为了Token的价格，机构和项目针对Token的策略是快速退出的渠道，而非维护项目运营发展的关键所在。\n\n### **空壳：从基础设施到应用场景**\n\n从基础设施到应用场景的空壳化结构蛀空了Web 3的发展脊柱。\n\n当我们在谈论Web 3时，涉及有关这一主旨的全部概念——从社交图谱、创作者经济到SaaS和协作工具，似乎已经全部完备，只待一声令下，Web 3就会迅速占据网络世界成为基础设施。但实际上什么都没有——CloudFlare一崩溃，预言机停止吟诵，交易所无法撮合……\n\n我们猛地发现，在Web 3的概念之下，在底层公链的支撑下，原来还有更底层的互联网协议在运作。在Web3的宏大愿景之下，我们可以发现目前横亘在理想和实践的差距：Web 3只是个空壳。\n\n![](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/034928510a6dd30457f10c24ae7dbc3e.jpg)\n\nWeb 3的底层仍旧是传统基础设施\n\n没有一个现象级的应用的现实，Web 3生态的飞轮效应就无法滚动起来。比如，目前社交协议主打SocialFi或者社交图谱概念，受到追捧的BBS Network，其50%的代币将会分发给活跃用户。那么活跃度如何提升呢？当然是制造“高质量”信息，在此逻辑下，有更多流量导入，跟随者、订阅者的活跃用户就会收获更多利益。这种机制来自于对DeFi中交易挖矿的模仿，人为鼓噪出足够的泡沫，最后留下一地鸡毛。\n\n目前我们只有Web 3对Web 2的拙劣模仿，可是我们需要做到保护隐私、数据可携带、社交可迁移等特质，就需要区块链、DeFi、NFT的参与，这才是有真实的使用需求的应用。\n\n![解析「Web3悖论」的内在机理与突破路径](https://www.ccvalue.cn/upload/2022/0717/007954a2b92128e9867684265c13212a.jpg)*解析「Web3悖论」的内在机理与突破路径*\n\n主流开发者涌入交易所等现金流充裕的赛道所使用的语言基本是Java、Go、Javascript等，而只有在涉及链上交互部分才会使用Rust、solidity等。如果他们认识不到Web 3的伟大意义，那么蓝图无人施工，永远无法成真。为什么Web 3应用会缺乏真实的使用需求？——道理很简单，因为产品不好用。这背后是因为优质开发者极度稀缺导致的。Web 3生态表面上稀缺的是用户，但以目前的Web 3使用者数万量级来计算，探索性应用都较少，仍旧需要更多技术性、基础性开发工具的建设。\n\n在熊市到来之际，coinbase、bybit甚至会进行裁员，这些开发者会重新流失，进一步恶化Web 3开发力量。在区块链的世界里，优质开发者对新工具、新技术的带动力量是巨大的，但目前的态势是将他们在挤出Web 3基础设施开发领域。Web 3生态可以说是万事俱备，但缺人才东风。\n\n### **未来：谁是躬身入局者？**\n\n我们简要概括Web 2/3之间的关系——希望我们可以管中窥豹，探索Web 3的未来图景。\n\n\\- 基础硬件目前一致：依旧是桌面端和移动端。Meta的VR设备并未与区块链技术或者链游产生直接联系，GameFi主要还是网页端和客户端为主并未广泛接入VR等设备，这是一个被有意无意忽略的一个关键点。VR设备还在铺设更广泛的使用路径。\n\n\\- 底层协议正在分化：网络底层并未完全抛弃HTTP、浏览器、TCP/IP等协议，但是UX/UI正在变化，美丑暂且不论，反正都以“赛博朋克”为主要取向，换句话说，公链作为通信协议，与IPFS作为数据库的模式并未完全取代现有的通信协议和中心化数据库。\n\n\\- 目前的Web 3.0以概念为主：互联网＋再进化-->Web 3.0+，如果这是必然发生的故事，那么就可以认为Web 3.0概念作为营销本身就是一种向现实世界的延伸。\n\n\\- 产品仍在迭代研发进程中：Web 3产品的生命周期不再固定化，会进入一个充满流动性的时代：用完即走服务也可以代币化和NFT化——本质上，门票用过一次不再使用，营销服务也可以用完即止，只要在于买卖双方达成共识，可以称为Token即服务。\n\n只是，这还需要一个过程实现，现在谈论Web 3.0的主要有三类人：\n\n**第一类：传统互联网大厂从业者**\n\n现在他们在跃跃欲试，主要是因为传统的流量模式已经到头了，在集体内卷的大厂中，已经有人准备驶入新航道，但是他们不改变思维的话，就会如同Facebook的Libra，或者所谓的联盟链技术一样。\n\n**第二类：crypto native**\n\n这类人或起步于公链，如Flow开始标榜自己是Web 3公链，或起步于DeFi/NFT/Metaverse项目组织，或是从大厂、机构中跳出来参与到Web 3的建设中。他们是目前最主力人群，如同开发Lens Protocol的Aave团队一样，大家都要学会拥抱变化。\n\n**第三类：传销的变种**\n\n传销的本质是产品模型在本质上无法盈利，在实操上均以拉人头为主的融资运营模式。此类人群不会对产品建设产生真正的兴趣，但他们往往声量最大，希望能尽可能拉拢人群参与其中，普通人在被骗后就会产生“Web 3＝骗局”的刻板印象。\n\n只有第二类人群成为主力，并且在未来有更多不同类型的人们进入到这个神奇的空间，发挥人类聪慧的大脑，创造出真正有价值的产品服务和使用场景。\n\nWeb 3的适应速度是超快的，要相信新产品模型的迭代速度，比如Nansen已经和Google Cloud合作提供实时市场数据。这就像是打不过就加入，Web 2和Web 3之间并不是隔绝的，而更像是双生子，Web 3给Web 2也留下了适应进化的时间。\n\n双方能达成合作的契合点在于，“Nansen 表示，数据将帮助做市商、对冲基金经理和资管经理训练他们的算法来预测市场走势、生成报告、指标等。”当新趋势成型，更多的主流群体就会参与其中，这是好的开端。\n\n我们会在接下来谈谈未来的Web 3产品究竟会长什么样——产品是Web 3能否重构下一代互联网的最基本的载体。认知是我们的灵魂，产品是我们的实体。最终，“Web3悖论”的突破路径还是要从开发者为加密生态提供用户可用的产品开始。\n\n敬请期待下篇。\n", "timestamp": 1658153634, "digest": "P6UWMVd-9QS4atPm2zkJa3-u3WM6luvntoQpwSQwWRo", "contributor":

In a broader sense, *Crisis* is an ongoing multi-media, multi-level experiment that explores alternative ideas for the distribution and exploitation of musical works. It is the journey of an album that defied the dominant structures of its system in order to break new ground.\n\nThis project aims to align *releases* ↔︎ *value* ↔︎ *community* into one common narrative. Read more about the process below.\n\n## The Story \\[Season 00\\]\n\nOne year ago the journey of Crisis began with the release of *[Crisis (The Worthless Album)](https://open.spotify.com/album/7nwbv2tj8q9OTWhin3ZBsm).* What was been planned as a traditional release, changed due to a pivotal decision.\n\nThe album was cut into 30 pieces, each 29 seconds long. Since a stream only starts counting after 30 seconds of playtime, it can't collect plays or earn any revenue, no matter how much it's listened to. The value of this album is 0.000$\n\nUltimately, this is the only way to choose one's own value in the current system of being patronised by a pro-rata system (streaming) of big tech and major labels. By releasing an album this way, it reveals quite the imbalance and absurdity of the music industry's current monetisation model and asks if centralised platforms should define the value of art according to a demand-supply calculation. Or, instead, shall creators regain complete control over the value they create.\n\n> \"*Valentin Hansen released an album in a way that’s never been done before.

To put it more simply, we will distribute ownership of *Crisis* during 9+ seasons.\n\nTherefore, the original album was minted as one piece of music on [Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/valentinhansen/crisis-the-album-).\n\nOwnership of this NFT will be represented by each season's tokens (editions of NFTs), with 50% of the shares being transferred within the first nine seasons. Additionally, each season represents the album in its current form. As seasonal NFTs are collected, the album starts to change visually, sonically, & experientially until that particular season sells out.\n\nUpon sellout, a new season unlocks, shape- shifting the album once more and unlocking further experiences, products, visuals, etc.\n\nThe remaining 50% will be allocated in season 10. This way—when the album becomes the most expensive work of music ever sold—it'll be fully owned by the community that helped it reach this status.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iIhgeVic-qPXG15O8qcM5.jpg?height=2589&width=2767)\n\nThe journey will continue as long as people keep unlocking the next chapter.

{"id": "t-2hziXaZIqqTDTs4o8Mn3z6YIhGFP1z3mSKHplgAd8", "title": "DAOs, Agency, and Control Society (Part 1)", "body": "@Zayn_R001\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn July 2021, with the approval of the Wyoming Secretary of State’s office, the American CryptoFed became the first legally recognized decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in the United States (Pongratz, 2021). This news made the headline of that week, raising widespread attention on DAO, on what it means and why it matters. DAO is an emergent technologybased on the invention and development of blockchain. The first DAO appeared only in 2016 with the name “TheDAO” (DuPont, 2017). Despite its collapse after hackers steal more than $50 million from its users, “TheDAO” has inspired a boom in a variety of new DAOs. To link DAOs with a broader social context, we are currently undergoing a transformation from web2.0 (platform economy) to web3.0 (token economy) in which DAO, with its unique properties, may serve a crucial role. This essay will first give a definition on the concept of DAOs as well as some fundamentally related concepts such as blockchain technology. Subsequently, Under the theme of social movement, I will take DAO as a technological practice to demonstrate how its agency can change the way people communicate and collaborate, and empowers decentralized communities and individuals against centralized power. Finally, explanation on how it can be a tool to accelerate the transformation of our society to the Deleuzian conception of a “*control society*” will also be given.\n\n \n\nDefinition of DAO\n\nBefore defining DAO, an explanation of the mechanism of blockchain technology must be given since DAOs are fundamentally built upon blockchains. Essentially, blockchains are lists of records, called *blocks*, that are linked together into a *chain* using cryptography (Acharjamayum et al., 2016, p. 609), and each block contains the records from previous blocks in an encrypted code. This makes the data on blockchain impossible to be modified once a *block* is linked to the *chain*. In other words, Blockchains can only be added, but not altered. Based on blockchain technology, there emerged the institutional technology called “*Decentralized Autonomous Organizations*” (DAOs). According to Hassan & De Filippi (2021, p. 2), a DAO is a “blockchain-based system that enables people to coordinate and govern themselves by a set of self-executing rules deployed on a public blockchain, and whose governance is decentralized.” In simple words, a DAO is an organization of people who communicate with each other via a “network protocol”. The network protocols are the rules and laws of DAOs, defined using smart contracts written by codes and stored on blockchains.These rules are self-executed by computers, independent from central control and unable to be modified (De Filippi & Wright, 2018, p. 146). As Buterin (2013, p. 23) states, DAO aims to replicate a traditional company or nonprofit by using only cryptographic blockchain technology for enforcement. DAOs are not managed by boards, but are governed solely by community participants with highly participatory processes. Members of DAO participate in the decision-making and maintenance of the DAOs. They are less hierarchical and usually more democratic.  “Wages” in DAOs, often in the form of token (cryptocurrencies), are distributed with a community reward mechanism. The more active one member participates in the community, the more token he or she will get.  In short, a DAO is a transparent organization built on blockchains, controlled by participants and not influenced by central institutions. \n\n \n\nDAOs’ Agency\n\nMost technologies are perceived to be under the control of human since they are the creation of humanity. However, agency, a “power and ability to do something”, is not the monopoly of human, technologies themselves are also able to affect human intention through their own agency (Slake & Wise, 2014, pp. 139-140). From a cultural deterministic perspective, people use the technology of DAO to achieve their intention of decentralized autonomy in several fields. By writing different rules in smart contracts, DAOs can be used for different functions such as a crowd-funding platform, a content-sharing platform, a fully automated company, or an automated decision-making machine (Hassan & De Filippi, 2021, p. 5). Yet this is not an accurate and comprehensive interpretation of DAO. Instead of inactively serving as a tool, DAO has its unique agency to actively promote change and progress. To illustrate, because the rules and laws of DAOs are written in the forms of codes and stored in unmodifiable blockchains self-executed by computational programs, the chances of any participants to commit scam or malfeasance are eliminated by making it fundamentally impossible in a technological way. This diminishes the need for continuous monitoring to detect scams or other insider misuses and thereby increases efficiency (Wright, 2021). Therefore, trust and consensus become easier to be established across members of DAOs since they must obey the rules once enter the community, which makes possible for an organization to be managed in a self-running, self-governing, and self-evolving manner that can achieve the maximum effectiveness and fairness of the organization. In other words, this agency of DAOs provides a new method of organizational supervision and law-making system in which no judges are needed and levels of subjectivity in regulation can be reduced to minimum.\n\nIn a broader social context, we are currently in a society dominated by centralized power. With the development and dominance of user-generated content (UGC), companies such as Twitter, YouTube, and WeChat have gained great success. Users create content on those platforms and companies take these contents as products for sale. For no doubt, this kind of economy has been a great achievement. Yet there are problems with the current economic model. To illustrate with the example of WeChat, when we register a WeChat account, we need to provide our real names, phone numbers, and bank accounts to WeChat as to “authenticate” our identities. Yet this causes the private information of users to be controlled by these companies and to be continuously facing the risk of information leakage. A famous example is the Facebook scandal in 2014 that 87 million users’ information was revealed in use of political advertising (Tuttle, 2018). This demonstrates how a centralized organization may be a threat to the privacy of individual users. In a hierarchical structure, centralized power can easily gather our information and contents of our creation for sale, and to accumulate their own wealth. DAOs as a form of technology, have the agencies to empower individuals to protect themselves against the exploitation of centralized institutions. To specify, in a DAO where no central organization exists, no one member can gain the access to the information of all community members. Besides, thanks to the use of cryptography in blockchain, users can be anonymous since IP addresses are encoded using cryptography. DAO participants only need a crypto wallet address to identify themselves. Therefore, even there is an attempt to steal personal information, it is technologically difficult to achieve. Hence the risk of privacy leakage can largely be reduced. In other words, the agency of DAO can empower us to regain control by protecting our privacy from the misuse of personal information and shifting power from centralized companies back to communities and individuals.Similar scenarios can also be found in the arena of business and finance. In a business world dominated by centralized banks, the usage of money is not transparent. To specify, when an individual deposits money to his or her bank account to gain interest, there is no way to know where the money goes and how it has been used. DAOs as a new form of institution can be a perfect solution to this problem by providing full transparency for trades. Every transaction made through DAOs can always be spotted on the blockchain. This builds up the traceability of individual assets. Although the implication has just begun, a lot of research has been conducted focusing on building decentralized exchanges (Lin et al., 2019) that operate on DAOs. The rules of transaction, written in codes and stored on blockchains, can function automatically with full transparency as the records of transactions will be listed on the new block that adds itself to the existing chain. Thus, the agency of blockchain and DAOs make transparent trades possible. Overall, it can be concluded that in multiple fields, the use of DAOs can be regarded as an active agent to decentralize and democratize our society by protecting individuals from centralized institutions.\n\n ", "timestamp": 1658154627, "digest": "aiiguvh-d1IFwcQUMDltmhUBVRAJICxCbo8id9gUZDc", "contributor": "0x41D8FE5D5A62e455C8cd33bDee8ecE7D4eA6aaCb"}

In a broader sense, *Crisis* is an ongoing multi-media, multi-level experiment that explores alternative ideas for the distribution and exploitation of musical works. It is the journey of an album that defied the dominant structures of its system in order to break new ground.\n\nThis project aims to align *releases* ↔︎ *value* ↔︎ *community* into one common narrative. Read more about the process below.\n\n## The Story \\[Season 00\\]\n\nOne year ago the journey of Crisis began with the release of *[Crisis (The Worthless Album)](https://open.spotify.com/album/7nwbv2tj8q9OTWhin3ZBsm).* What had been planned as a traditional release, changed due to a pivotal decision.\n\nThe album was cut into 30 pieces, each 29 seconds long. Since a stream only starts counting after 30 seconds of playtime, it can't collect plays or earn any revenue, no matter how much it's listened to. The value of this album is 0.000$\n\nUltimately, this is the only way to choose one's own value in the current system of being patronised by a pro-rata system (streaming) of big tech and major labels. By releasing an album this way, it reveals quite the imbalance and absurdity of the music industry's current monetisation model and asks if centralised platforms should define the value of art according to a demand-supply calculation. Or, instead, shall creators regain complete control over the value they create.\n\n> \"*Valentin Hansen released an album in a way that’s never been done before.

Analysis of the OmniBTC ($SO) project, an all-chain trading platform", "body": "### Twitter@godotsancho\n\nWhat happens when you combine two leading cross-chain projects, built on LayerZeo and participating in the Polkadot slot auction? This is what OmniBTC will experiment with.\n\n## What is OmniBTC?\n\nOmniBTC, formerly SOSwap, is an omni-chain DeFi platform built by the ChainX team based on the LayerZero protocol, offering Token omni trading and omni lending of BTC.\n\n![SOSwap](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RpxaIE-MdP8H6Zn1r62Wy.png?height=510&width=865)\n\n**Core functions include.**\n1/ All-chain trading. Based on LayerZero chain-wide interoperability and MMC (Maker Margin Contract) contract, users can trade Tokens from any chain.\n\nWhen users trade, OmniBTC will calculate the best slippage and Gas scheme across DEX according to the algorithm, and divide the transaction amount into several parts to ensure that users complete the transaction in the best way.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BwV7s5Mow7xvUTMJpwnXv.png?height=444&width=865)\n\n2/BTC all-chain lending. Combining ChainX with LayerZero, users can lend out BTC to any stable coin on any chain.\nFor this feature, you need to cross-chain BTC to ChainX Bitcoin Taproot multi-signature address first to get XBTC.\nThen complete lending by ChainX and LayerZero.\n\nThe benefit of going through XBTC and then all-chain lending is that you don't have to wait for BTC's often 10-minute long block confirmation time when cross-chaining with BTC, shortening the waiting time.\nThis is especially crucial for margin calls in extreme market conditions.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ouNjMd6FfC50Wz6Mfxeh6.png?height=444&width=865)\n\nCurrently, OmniBTC is deployed to the Arbitrum and BSC networks and is participating in the current round of Polkadot slot auctions.\n\nUsers who vote DOT for OmniBTC will receive 0.3 SO Token per vote.\n\n0\\.33 SO Token per vote if voted via ComingChat.\n\nOmniBTC will establish a parallel chain of WASM + EVM, and LayerZero protocol will also be deployed in the parallel chain EVM, bringing omni transactions into Polkadot ecology, while users can use BTC to borrow stable coins USDT, aUSD, etc. within Polkadot ecology.\n\n**Summary**\nOmniBTC is an omni-chain trading platform, as well as a BTC omni-chain lending platform, built on LayerZero and Polkadot.\n\nUsing LayerZero omni-chain properties, it builds an entrance between Polkadot and omni-chain , helping aUSD and other Polkadot ecological native Tokens to increase liquidity and collateral categories.\n\n## Tokenomics\n\nOmniBTC native Token SO, total supply of 210,000.\n\nOutput 0.05 SOs per minute, 72 per day, halved every 2.1 million minutes.\n\nSO is allocated to users according to LP pool weight and LP ratio. PCX, USB, KSX, MINI trading pool weight is 5, SO with these four Token trading pool weight is 10, the rest is 1.\n\n## Current operation of the project\n\nCurrently, OmniBTC official website (<https://omnibtc.finance/>) shows that the application is not yet live (coming soon). SOSwap, current TVL $1.83 million, current TVL is the historical peak. 24-hour trading volume $1570, peak trading volume is $178,420.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y_PLVMRw3fl5kRJd3EcoD.png?height=328&width=865)\n\nSOSwap was launched in March 2022 and is currently live for trading, cross-chain bridges, liquidity mining, and supports SherpaX EVM , ChainX EVM and Polkadot mainnet.\n\nHowever, currently, certain features are not available when switching to ChainX and Polkadot chains. The main TVL and transactions are concentrated on the SherpaX chain.\n\nIn addition, OmniBTC will be integrated into ComingChat, another web3 social finance application in the ChainX ecosystem, which allows the 8 million ComingChat users worldwide to easily use OmniBTC on their cell phones.\n\n## Project Analysis\n\n### 1/ Is there a demand for it? How big is the market where it is located? What is the current market situation?\n\n![Data as of July 16, 2022, 13:30 UTC](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l2YlSDhXBvoKS9JTQbVGg.png?height=104&width=865)\n\nIn this paper, we choose ThorChain and Stargate Finance as the benchmark; ThorChain is an independent public chain and Stargate is an application built on LayerZero.\n\nOmniBTC is also built on LayerZero, and it participates in Polkadot slot auction and plans to become a parallel chain, so ThorChain with public chain and Stargate with application are selected for comparison.\n\n(1) Stargate mainly provides cross-chain function for EVM chain stablecoin and ETH.\n\nWhile ThorChain provides many non-EVM chain cross-chain functions, even PoW and PoS cross-chain, such as Dogecoin.\n\n(2) Both of these all-chain protocols have over 100 million TVLs. According to DeFiLlama, Stargate TVL is ranked 25th among all included dApps, and ThorChain is ranked 10th among included public chains, second only to Arbitrum and higher than Optimism.\n\n(3) ThorChain stipulates that when providing liquidity, users need to provide RUNE with other Tokens in a 1:1 ratio, which means that RUNE actually acts as a oracle and is priced by the RUNE Token in relation to other Token exchange. Therefore, ThorChain TVL is more closely related to RUNE.\n\n(4) From the current point of view, OmniBTC native Token economic model, more like STG, the relationship between market value and TVL, and the relationship between FDV and TVL, perhaps similar to Stargate. At that time, the TVL and ratio can be used to invert the SO market cap and FDV.\n\n(5) In the current bear market, the Stargate protocol still has a 24-hour trading volume of $2.8 million, while ThorSwap, the main DEX protocol of the ThorChain ecosystem, has a 24-hour trading volume of over $30 million.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ft3SalWafPja_AvRvxydX.png?height=604&width=865)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FJEMmCgAhjFzcRbMSEzja.png?height=491&width=865)\n\n(6) According to ThorChain and ThorSwap data, BTC, bUSD, ETH, BNB, USDC cross-chain is the main demand in terms of historical trading volume and current day trading volume.\n\nIn summary, OmniBTC is in the all-chain trading market, and the demand exists. Both ThorChain, an independent public chain, and Stargate, also built on LayerZero, have a TVL of over $400 million and a 24-hour transaction volume of over a million dollars in a bear market.\n\n### 2/ What are the core competencies of the project? Does it create a barrier? Competitive pairing situation?\n\nAt the full chain trading level.\nOmniBTC competitiveness is that (1) ChainX team has been steeped in BTC research for many years, and has certain advantages in securing assets and other technical aspects. (2) The support of Polka ecology.\n\nWithin the polka ecology.\nOmniBTC advantage is that there is no similar project at the moment. It has a first-mover advantage.\n\nIn fact, OmniBTC can be said to have certain advantages, but it is difficult to say whether it has built a barrier. The competitors are as shown in ThorChain and Stargate.\n\nIn the future, to observe whether OmniBTC has built a barrier, we can focus on the following indicators.\n(1) XBTC balance on ChainX chain. <https://scan.chainx.org/crossBlock>\n(2) The adoption of XBTC by other DeFi projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, and the XBTC pool liquidity.\n\n**Additional Bitcoin Taproot related knowledge.**\nChainX CEO Guo Guanghua has introduced the advantages of using Taproot in the AMA.\n\n**What is Taproot?**\n\nTaproot contains two important components: the MAST contract (MAST contract) and the Schnorr signature (Schnorr signature).\n\nThe MAST contract is a Merkle-tree-style data structure. Schnorr signature is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that allows linear addition to the signature.\n\n**What are the benefits of Taproot?**\n\nTaproot improves data privacy prior to, and during, bitcoin transactions. Also, multiple signatures can be added linearly within one, saving storage space and verification procedures, and improving performance. Breaking the original 15 multi-signature limit of Bitcoin, it is more decentralized.\n\nIn addition, the MAST contract incorporates scripting programming for greater programmability.\n\n**ChainX and Taproot**\n\nWe quote here from the official ChainX Blog (<https://chainx-org.medium.com/610-million-stolen-from-ronin-bridge-how-does-chainx-keep-user-assets-safe->) d84a545e5936).\n\nChainX’s custodians use the ComingChat threshold wallet with Taproot technology for multi-signature. Each trust keeps its own private key fragments, and these private key fragments are aggregated off-chain to form aggregated private keys and aggregated public keys.\n\nIn the traditional multi-signature scheme, people can know the address (public key) of each trust from the chain. \n\nBased on these addresses, hackers then use further methods to steal the private keys corresponding to these addresses. Taproot fundamentally solves this problem. \n\nThe Schnorr algorithm can realize the off-chain aggregation of private key fragments, so the outside world can only see a new address aggregated from the addresses of the 10 trustees on the chain, and people cannot even know whether it is an ordinary single signature or Multi-signature. \n\nf it is impossible to know the respective addresses of each trust, it is naturally impossible to know the respective private keys of each trust. This ensures the absolute security of user assets.\n\n### 3/ What are the current shortcomings of the project?\n\n(1) OmniBTC is currently under-publicized and under-attended. There are 2,112 Twitter followers.\n(2) The balance of XBTC on ChainX chain is 19.6536 pieces in total. At the funding level, it does not help OmniBTC much.\n\n(3) Currently there are not many trading pairs available in OmniBTC DEX, the Token variety is not rich enough, and it is concentrated on the EVM chain SherpaX. A large number of Swap Pools are underfunded and cannot be traded.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NS64laqYhNLpjZG7SHD3n.png?height=464&width=865)\n\n### 4/ Future direction of the project? How expandable is the business? Can business expansion expand market capitalization?\n\n(1) The launch of the non-custodial model, in improving BTC cross-chain security, with liquidity mining incentives, and the adoption of XBTC by other projects in Polkadot ecology. It may be able to gain more market share.\n\n(2) OmniBTC is still in the early stage, there is still a lot of work to do in terms of liquidity building, and the BTC omni-chain lending pool is not yet online.\n\n(3) OmniBTC BTC omni-chain lending is planned to cooperate with MakerDAO. If the BTC all-chain lending is then combined with PCX rewards, it may attract more users and share part of the market share of wBTC and renBTC.\n\n### 5/ Team situation?\n\nOmniBTC is developed by the PolkaX team. The team is currently developing the Bitcoin Layer2 network ChainX, the crypto chat tool ComingChat, the EVM network SherpaX, and more.\n\nIn the official Blog published on August 3, 2021 (<https://chainx-org.medium.com/chainx-an-overview-a418005e54bf>), the current 5 development teams are introduced.\n\nWorking on XBTC 2.0, Taproot integration, EVM and WASM, ComingChat UI and UX, and ComingChat Red Envelope for Coming Chat, respectively.\n\n### 6/ Social media situation?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cuabM-rOZkw70XBWHsQjf.png?height=454&width=865)\n\n### 7/ Under what circumstances can barriers be broken? How can you tell when a barrier is broken? What are the indicators?\n\nOmniBTC is still in its early stage and has not built a competitive barrier. As mentioned earlier, one can focus on.\n(1) XBTC balance on ChainX chain. <https://scan.chainx.org/crossBlock>\n(2) XBTC adoption by other DeFi projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, and XBTC pool liquidity.\n\n### 8/ What are the people and drivers of token selling and buying, respectively? Can the demand for token purchases be sustained? Can it offset token sell-offs? Can business expansion increase demand for tokens?\n\nAs of now, the SO sell-off is mainly coming from liquidity mining rewards.\n\nToken application scenarios other than liquidity mining have not been fully announced. Perhaps a Gas scenario will be available in the future.\n\nIn the long term, SO value will come primarily from demand for governance of the BTC omni-chain lending pool, and treasury revenue for purchase to destroy SO, or possibly through a deflationary scenario similar to the EIP1559 proposal, but the time required is all expected to be long.\n\n### 9/ Risks?\n\n(1) Systemic risks from the security side.\n(2) Substitution risk from Polkadot ecology in addition to the full chain of projects.\n\n## Twitter @godotsancho", "timestamp": 1658154783, "digest": "3Y7ocHE5gaTd55Al9qOyCGpjuhFw-ZNu8no_BkIx42w", "contributor": "0xCBd79B90a9B6A09B22D463494a474062f47Cc4Cf"}

{"id": "hr-Ia2wgFK8s9irAaPBIA3ryS2NXcnLcYwekIlprOpE", "title": "Web3 academy", "body": "“The age of Web3 is coming!”, “The Web3 arms race is upon us”. These are just few of the headlines that came along in 2022 so far. Is this just a new hype that has been unleashed or could Web3 really become a technology revolution? Via a series of articles, Tech Lab will explain more about Web3, what is it, how does it work, what can it do, and what are the main challenges ahead.\n\nSo, what is Web3? Let’s firsthave a look at Web2. Because if there is a Web3, there must be a Web2, right? Web2 is the internet as we know it today. One of the main characteristics of Web2 is that information, web applications, platforms and services are centralised. If we want to participate in the Web2 world, we are forced to share our data and identity with organisations like Meta and Google, with very little control over what happens with that data and identity. \n\nOne of the main tasks of Web3 is to shift the power over data and identity towards the owner or initiator of the data. By organising the internet in a decentralised way,data can be stored anywhere,also thanks to blockchain administering data control, ownership, as well asuring data privacy through encryption. This is why Web3 is also called decentralized internet or decentralized web. \n\nWhen you hear people talking about Web 3.0 (instead of Web3) they could also mean something else, namely the semantic web. Both Web3 and Web 3.0 want to offer an alternative to the current web,but they have a different focus. The semantic web (Web 3.0)focuses on efficiency and intelligence,and works by reusing and linking data across websites. The decentralized web (Web3)focuseson empowerment and security,by giving power over data and identity back to the people.\n\nSo, when you read something online about the subject, how can you really distinguish the two concepts? Well, apparently you cannot be 100% sure. The fact that there is still no consensus about the definition of Web3 is part of the challenge. It’s hard to write a series of articles on something that hasn’t been defined yet, but here at Tech Lab we like challenges. And from now on, whenever you see us talking about Web3, keep in mind that we are referring to the decentralized web.\n\nTo be continued...", "timestamp": 1658155205, "digest": "jGmm7yLfQf-QLl3k361OF4ZNDLVuw1xcrHma2uEsGx8", "contributor": "0x13366EAF0cC9f36eaAD8247036dE7D78c6f4B37B"}

of History **本身并不是共识机制**，而是用于提高 Solana 的 Proof of Stake (权益证明) 共识的性能。\n\n它还可以用于提高数据平面协议的性能，历史证明 (POH) 建立了一个历史记录，证明在特定时间点存在特定事件。每个验证者都会跟踪时间, 通过在 SHA-256、顺序散列可验证延迟函数 (VDF) 中对其进行编码。因此，验证者之间无需在处理前进行相互通信确认 ( 通常每个节点需要沟通自己的 precommit 和 prevote), 这大大提高了在速度以及容量上的效率。\n\n举个例子：汽车制造厂，以往在零部件生产出来后，汽车需要依次通过冲压，焊接，涂装，总装加工等流程，而汽车制造厂也是依据这个步骤生产不同的零件，而 POH 允许汽车制造厂同时完成不同零件的生产，之后这些零件再按照拼装顺序，完成冲压，焊接，涂装，总装加工等，POH 允许并行生产的可能性，大大减少了沟通成本和时间成本。\n\n在我们上篇文章 [Solana 的逆袭之路 - SQLANA](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNzUyOTYzMw==&mid=2247483860&idx=1&sn=95b6e869d391c73f04daed4c82cd83be&chksm=e8c67e9adfb1f78ca9007c3e47e5dc51bbed36424f05c6da867f2741f025d6d10642b927e640&token=976057225&lang=zh_CN&scene=21#wechat_redirect), 我们重点介绍了 **Solana 的特性**，包括 Proof of History 共识机制、TPS 和 TTF 完美结合、优先交易模型、 **Solana 的去中心化之路**、**Solana 上流动性质押协议**、**NFT 市场**等，而本文我们将进一步挖掘其**技术细节**、**设计框架**以及最新上线的 Solana Mobile Stack 等**产品**，**生态简介**以及其潜在的新上线的 **L1 竞品**。\n\nSolana 目前主要背靠 FTX 以及 Jump Crypto，与中心化交易所的紧密联系, 会加速新用户以及资金的流入，如果做类比的话可以考虑币安及 BNB 链，除了提供低交易费用，BNB 链的搭建也意在战略层面为巨大的币安用户群提供 Defi 的第一个入口。\n\n此外, 币安的 Launchpad 和币安 Defi 质押等产品是用户与 BNB 生态交互的关键,  进一步加速了网络的蓬勃发展。当然币安除了 BNB 链以外, 还有币安智能链 (BSC), 币安智能链（BSC）可以理解为与币安链并行的区块链，与币安链不同的地方在于，BSC (POA) 拥有智能合约功能并与以太坊虚拟机（EVM）兼容。\n\n这里的设计目标是保持完整币安链的高吞吐量的同时，能够将智能合约引入其生态系统。(之前有社区小伙伴不了解 mapofzone 中 Crypto.Org 以及 Cronos 的区别, 我们也与 Cronos 上 POA 进行了沟通。本质上你可以将 Crypto.Org 理解为 BNBchain, 通过质押等产品拓展生态, 而 Cronos 可以理解为 BSC, 其引入了 EVM 兼容, 并且通过 POA 共识机制提供开放, 可扩展性以及可互操作性的开放式平台。)\n\n因此，Solana 采用了类似的策略, 包括集成 FTX 以及利用 FTX 团队开发的 Serum’s CLOB 模型；而 Jump Crypto 在 Solana 的早期提供了非常大的作用，作为行业头部的资本巨鳄以及做市商，其深度的参与做市帮助 Solana 减少了交易流动性风险，而低流动性、 高滑点对于早期项目的发展是非常不利的。当然随着网络的发展, 用户的增长以及生态的搭建，做市商的作用将会逐渐被弱化。\n\nElectic Capital 是一家专注于技术开发社区的 Web3.0 资本，根据 2021 的报告结果，Solana 的开发者在这一年增长了 500%，在开发者增长率上排名第一。同时 Rust 语言, Solana, Polkadot, Cosmos 都在使用的, 在 2021Stack Overflow 开发者问卷调查中也排名第一, 这个结果也帮助解释了 Rust 开发者社区的快速增长。\n\n尽管目前以以太坊主导的 EVM 开发社区仍然是加密行业中主导力量，我们认为新的开发语言 (比如 Rust) 会为行业输入更多新的开发者（包括 Web2.0），并且带来更多的创新。当然，具有 Solana 可扩展性以及流动性的 Neon 以太坊兼容环境的出现（可以理解为 Cosmos 上的 Evmos 或者 Polkadot 上的 MoonBeam 等）, 以及 Solana Mobile 等新产品的上线，会进一步为 Solana 带来更多的项目和用户。\n\n## 核心技术\n\n### POH\n\n快速、可靠的同步是 Solana 能够实现如此高吞吐量的最大原因，一般区块链 L1 在区块上进行同步, 区块可以理解为一篮子交易，区块时间指的是开采一个新区块所需的时间。在以太坊中，平均出块时间在 12 到 14 秒之间，并在每个区块挖出后再进行评估，预期区块时间在协议层面被设定为一个常数，当矿工增加计算能力时，用于保护网络的安全，平均区块时间与预期区块时间进行比较，如果平均区块时间较高，则区块头的难度会降低。\n\n所以通过同步区块，交易只有到一定区块时间才会被处理。在 POW 共识机制中, 这个区块时间通常比较长, 需要 10 分钟, 以减少多个验证节点在同一时间生产有效区块的可能性。这个问题我们在[加密经济的 MEV 博弈：Osmosis 的阈值加密技术 vs Flashbot 的 SGX?](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNzUyOTYzMw==&mid=2247483913&idx=1&sn=36a552cedfde980728b6dd79a4873299&chksm=e8c67d47dfb1f451b6f51d5a113496edcdc4906977d71a4b3d74ad3cc376137ccd8773c0c7c7&token=2086007547&lang=zh_CN&scene=21#wechat_redirect) 中提到过,  在 POW 中 (概率出块)， 两个矿工可以同时算出这个概率结果，但是由于网络延迟等原因，你无法保证其他人是否也在同一时间算出了这个结果。\n\n而对于节点来说，你需要决定将哪个区块加入到公共账本，这个会根据两个区块的计算工作总量来决定。这里面的问题在于如果能够即时回滚几个区块，快速执行比实际规范更多的计算工作，然后将其显示给网络，这个就是我们通常指的时间强盗攻击 Time bandit attack，所以在 POW 中区块是同时提交的，而确认会需要更多时间，因为攻击者在解密后可以通过潜在的重组给链带来 MEV 漏洞。\n\n而在 POS 中没有这种限制，但是验证者需要通过时间戳决定区块顺序。通常的做法是给每个区块标注时间戳，但是受到网络延迟等影响，时间戳的有效性通常在 1-2 小时，为了解决这个问题, 区块时间也被相应延长, 确保每个区块的中位时间戳总是在增加**。**\n\n而在 Solana 的 POH 机制设计中，领导节点通过加密证明 (自从上次证明已经过去了一段时间) “时间戳” 区块。所有散列到证明中的数据肯定是在证明生成之前发生的，然后这个领导节点和验证节点共享新区块，验证节点负责验证这些证明。所以本质上 POH 可以理解为一堆证明，每一个都证明一些数据存在在创建证明之前，同时在上一个证明之前已经过去了一段时间。\n\n这些区块可以以任意顺序发送给验证节点，通过这种可信同步的概念,Solana 可以将区块分解为更小的条目 (相比于区块包括更小的批次交易)，而在区块共识确认之前, 这些条目 (entries) 将以实时流 (Stream) 的形式传输给验证节点，所以通过这种技术，Solana 可以实现毫秒级别的确认时间 (800 毫秒=0.8 秒)。\n\n这里要注意的是,，领导节点将有效批次交易放置于条目之后, 这些条目可以迅速以实时流 (Steam) 的形式传输给验证节点，而在的假设下,，这个过程并不会出现延迟，也就是接受条目之后，验证节点可以立即投票， 而这个**乐观处理技术**我们称为乐观并发控制 Optimitstic Concurrency Control。\n\n所以相较于大部分主打 POS 机制的 Layer1 链，通过将交易广播至全网后才能完成确认 (节点间也需要再沟通自己的 precommit 和 prevote, 之后节点集投票代表某个区块高度的全账本, 交易确认)，在 Solana 上，交易确认只需要验证上个条目的 POH 哈希。\n\n### VDF\n\nPOH 最先于 2017 年 11 月由 Solana 提出, 而次年斯坦福大学介绍了一种类似的技术，称为可验证延迟函数或者称为 VDF， 是个需要固定时间来执行的函数，并且可以生成它运行的证明，而这个证明相较于生成所需的时间，可以在更短的时间内进行验证，所以其核心特性是快速的验证时间。Solana 验证其延迟函数的方法与创建其所花费的时间成正比，拆分 4000 core GPU , 速度足以满足 Solana 的要求，但是 Solana 的算法相对较慢。所以 VDF 泛指可验证延迟函数的类别，而不仅仅是具有特定性能特征的子集。\n\nPoH 和 VDF 之间的另一个区别是 VDF 仅用于跟踪持续时间，而 PoH 的哈希链包括应用程序观察到的任何数据的哈希值，所以在 POH 中，尽管数据证明了历史，证明了某事件在某个特定时间点发生——数据肯定存在于它之后的哈希之前。但另一方面，这意味着应用程序可以通过更改数据被哈希的时间来操纵哈希链 (POH)。因此，PoH 链不能作为随机性的良好来源，而没有该数据的 VDF 则可以。例如，Solana 的领导者旋转算法仅来自 VDF 高度，而不是来源于其在该高度的哈希值。\n\n#### 设计框架\n\n相比于以太坊的 12-13 秒区块时间, 和每个区块 7,000 笔交易的区块大小，Solana 可以实现 0.4 秒区块时间, 和每个区块 2,000 笔交易的区块大小，同时用户可以享有极低的交易手续费。\n\n同时，Solana 引入的 POH 机制、VDF 函数等执行层的创新, 使其实现了底层的扩展， 相比于模块化的设计, 此设计的优势在于可编程性以及可组合性，而 Rollup 为代表的模块化区块链会存在分散性流动性以及 Rollups 之间的可信桥互通问题，当然虽然目前 Rollups 之间的无需信任互操作性仍然没有完全解决，但是 Slush 等相关提案已经在关于如何在不同 ZKR 间实现无缝分型拓展进行讨论。\n\n同时 Polynya 也公开表示，Solana 的执行层创新是 Rollups 应该学习的，尽管 Rollups 它们在很多方面都具有不可持续的架构，但可以通过采用欺诈证明、有效性证明和/或数据可用性抽样来解决很多问题, 而下文也会介绍 Solana 也将计划引入这些技术。\n\n除了执行层的创新，Solana 非常依赖于摩尔定律，所以 Solana 节点需要的硬件配置要求相较于其他 L1 也会高很多，一个 Solana 的验证节点可以加载几百个以太坊 2.0 节点, 而其扩展性也随着时间依赖于硬件的性能和迭代对这块感兴趣的可以看我们之前的文章单片链 vs 模块链- [Solana 和 Celestia 创始人最新辩论](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNzUyOTYzMw==&mid=2247483845&idx=1&sn=ad0ffe00e8b9e2987d9fc01cd4471822&chksm=e8c67e8bdfb1f79d807f71602d7c6a5fea2c39dad945cefdead0c893820f99426d2d9ba98e55&token=2086007547&lang=zh_CN&scene=21#wechat_redirect)。\n\n所以尽管硬件的性能有助于其扩展性, 也会带来与之而来的 trade off 问题。目前考虑到较高的门槛, 大部分的节点都以 Solana 基金会的名义运营, 同时在 1876 个节点中, 前 25 个节点就掌握了 33.% 的质押, 而 33.33% 的质押勾结就可以摧毁整个网络。所以无论是高度依赖基金会的节点分布, 还是头重脚轻的节点权重, 都给整个网络带来了潜在的中心化风险。\n\n而本文的开头也提出,Solana 目前用的是 Rust 语言, 而目前以太坊主导的 EVM 开发社区仍然是加密行业的核心力量, 对于开发者来说,EVM 可以快速, 轻松地在其他兼容链上部署, 而 EVM 使用的是 Solidity 语言。\n\n然而, 我们看到 Rust (Wasm 语言区中最大的, 第二大的是 Assembly Script, 第三大 Go 等) 社区正在经历快速的增长, 不管在不同生态 (Cosmos, Solana, Polkadot) 人气增长, 还是从 Web2.0 开发者社区迁移来的大量新开发者, 同时 Rust 的高门槛, 大量减少了分叉项目。\n\n这里要提几个核心点,Solana 上的项目是部分开源 (Serum, Magic Eden 没有开源?), 而在 Cosmos 上通常情况下, 尽管可以直接分叉项目 (比如分叉 Osmosis, 但是实际上并不可行, 你需要去寻找一系列安全的验证节点), 但是消费链的上线似乎又降低了这个门槛, Proposal 72 提及的 P2P Validator 开发的 Neutron 似乎是分叉了 Juno Network, 因而引发了 Juno 生态的极度方案。当然分叉某个模块没为什么问题, 比如 Sceret 等链分叉 Gravity Bridge, Goland 分叉了 Cosmos SDK 等。\n\n## 中心化以及扩展性解决方案\n\nSolana 现有的中心化性质对网络的安全构成了风险。然而随着时间的推移，节点数量增多, 网络可能会变得更加分散。当然我们之前也多次强调去中心化和节点数量并没有直接联系。什么是真正的去中心化呢，比如质押/哈希算法的分发范围，比如代币的分发范围，比如客户端的个数，比如参与共识的验证节点数，比如可以影响 POS33% 或者 POW51% 的节点和矿工数。\n\n举个例子，虽然 Cosmos 目前协议从 150 个节点增加到了 175 个节点，但也并不说明了更去中心化。他们希望实现的是真正实现投票权/治理的分散。所以 Cosmos 希望通过治理解决，将 Community Pool 的资金分发给不同的长尾节点（质押数量不多，新的节点），但是有非常好的，产品服务发展路径，通过提供质押资金，让他们更好地为 Cosmos 生态赋能 (funding public goods - Optiminism Two Token house model)。\n\n那么 Solana 上是怎么解决的呢? 这里不得不提到 Solana 上的**流动性质押协议**，其中目前排名第一的 Marinade 一定程度上帮助实现了治理/质押权益的分散。Marinade Finance 将质押分散给不同的小社区节点, 确保收益和激励分发给到社区, 最终反哺给生态, 同时也缓解了中心化的问题。\n\n而 **Solana 高度依赖的摩尔定律**认为集成电路上可以容纳的晶体管数目在大约每经过 18 个月便会增加一倍，所以相同的价格下购买的机器，每 18 个月可以提升一倍的性能，所以 Solana 节点需要的硬件配置要求非常之高，而其扩展性也随着时间依赖于硬件的性能和迭代, 硬件的提升也会一定程度上解决这个验证节点的高门槛问题。\n\n同时, 基于其在执行层的现有创新,Anatoly 会考虑引入欺诈证明, 有效性证明以及数据可见采样等技术, 在不牺牲性能的前提下, 提升网络的安全性。值得注意的是，区块链网络首先是社会经济运动，其次是代码。因此，虽然采用更好的代码是最受欢迎的，并且可能会带来技术上的可持续性，但实现社会和经济上的可持续性同样重要。\n\n目前为止，Solana 上的费用微不足道，没有任何拥堵费，它可以支付运行复制品 (replicas) 的成本，至少在牛市的时候是这样。硬件并不昂贵，任何具有任何 PMF 的链都可以支付费用 (Polynya 和 Anatoly 的 Twiter 讨论)。当然其社会可持续性体现在较低门槛的 DPOS 机制, 实现真正的全民民主制度。\n\n产品方面, Solana 带来了极好的用户体验, Phantom 以及 Magic Eden 都已经上线了手机版本, 同时 Solana Mobile Stack 和 Saga 将会推动 Solana 移动兼容性, 助力 Solana 的 mass adoption 进度。目前, 大部分加密行业的产品还主要集中于电脑端, 而 Solana 手机的上线致力于改变这种现状。\n\n通过 Solana Mobile Stack，一个适用于 Android 的开源软件工具包，使用 Seed Vault 安全托管协议在 Solana 上可以启用原生 Android web3 应用程序，该协议有助于即时签署交易，同时将私钥与钱包、应用程序和 Android 操作系统分开。\n\n其中的核心功能包括**移动钱包适配器**：一种用于将 Web 应用程序和原生 Android 应用程序连接到移动设备上的钱包的协议。开源协议旨在支持所有移动平台，而不仅仅是 Android，并且可以与钱包应用程序一起使用，为远程运行的应用程序（如其他移动设备、台式机或笔记本电脑）提供签名服务。\n\n**Seed Vault**：内置于移动设备中的安全环境，将私钥、助记词和机密与应用程序层分开，但仍能够与设备或移动浏览器中运行的应用程序进行交互。Seed Vault 可访问设备上可用的最高特权安全环境，从处理器的安全操作模式到专用安全元素，通过 Android 内置的 UI 组件实现安全的交易签名体验。\n\n**适用于 Android 的 Solana Pay**：Solana Pay 是 Solana 上的分散式支付轨道，内置于 Solana Mobile Stack，使钱包应用能够使用 Android 设备的系统功能通过 QR 码、NFC 点击、消息和用于启动 Solana Pay 请求的 Web 浏览器交互。此外，即时虚拟卡发行将允许用户通过传统支付渠道在全球数千万商户进行基于自托管资金的非接触式移动支付。\n\n**此外，Solana dApp Store** 是 Android 上用于去中心化应用程序的新应用程序分发系统。Solana dApp Store 将为希望与客户建立直接关系的应用程序提供分销渠道，让他们无需支付平台费用即可进行交易。Solana dApp Store 将与设备上的 Google Play 共存，提供对 web2 和 web3 应用程序的访问。\n\n所以 Solana Mobile 在将新用户引入 Solana 方面的重要性是非常巨大的。同时还宣布承诺提供 1000 万美元的生态系统捐赠，以加速移动 dApp 的开发, 有兴趣的童鞋可以联系我们。\n\n除了 Rust 社区, Solana 也在向 EVM 社区扩展, Neon Labs 的开发——Solana 上的原生 EVM。这让 Solana 可以更具有可扩展性并提高其在其他 L1 中的竞争力。它目前在\n\nSolana Devnet 上面向开发人员和测试人员的 Alpha 阶段。该项目提出由 Jump Capital 和 Spartan 等知名投资者领投的 4000 万美元。Neon 的 EVM 实现将允许它处理\n\n到 4,500 TPS，如果成功, 这将使 Solana 成为全球最快的 EVM 兼容区块链。虽然没有明确的主网启动日期，我们 CFG Labs 将保持持续关注。当然, 鉴于与 EVM 架构相关的工具和基础设施以及其强大的网络效应, 除了 Solana 以外, 其他链, 比如 Polkadot(Moonbeam), Polygon, Avalanche 也接入了 EVM。\n\n聊到跨链这块,Solana 上跨以太坊的两个值得注意的桥包括和 Allbridge。最近，FTX 宣布支持\n\nWormhole 的 Portal 桥成为他们首选的跨链桥。这意味着 FTX 将扩大对 Portal-wrapped 代币 存款和取款的支持。这意味着，Portal 桥将支持为 FTX 上 500 百万用户提供了更加无缝的桥接体验。通过启用 Portal 包装的 ERC-20 代币（如 $ETH $YFI 和 $SUSHI）的存款/取款，FTX 社区的用户可以轻松地在 Solana 上的各种 DeFi 协议中使用他们的代币。\n\n所有 Portal 包装 (Portal Wrapped) 的资产都可以在链之间自由移动，而不会被双重包装。这意味着，用户可以将 ETH(Portal) 从 Ethereum 发送到 Polygon，再到 Solana 到 Oasis - 他们仍然拥有 ETH(Portal)。\n\n关于生态系统的增长，Solana 通过举办一系列黑客马拉松吸引开发者 。2020 年 11 月的第一届黑客马拉松，吸引了超过 1,000 名参与者和 60 多名项目。从那以后，又举办了四次黑客马拉松，每一次的人数都在增加项目提交和申请人的数量。IGNITION，第四届黑客马拉松，共计收到近 6000 名申请者和 568 个项目提交。 \n\n## 潜在风险\n\n如果经常发生中断，Solana 上的网络不稳定将会是一个重大问题。2022 年迄今已发生 5 次停机，停机时间从 最近一次的 4 小时到 1 月份的一次长达 6 天，网络中断主要归因于 NFT 铸造机器人和套利机器人。因此为了提高网络稳定性并减少链上造成的停机时间，Solana 在其测试网上的 v1.10 更新中实施了更改网络。Metaplex（帮助开发和启动 NFT 的协议）也\n\n将进行更改以稳定网络，例如实施机器人 Metaplex Candy Machine 中的罚款以及试图执行无效交易的任何钱包的 0.01 SOL 罚款。这些手段可以在机器人交易发生时检测它们，大大减少未来的网络拥塞情况。大多数新的 #SolanaNFT 项目都使用 Candy Machine 来推出他们的系列和作品。\n\n在这个更改中，当钱包尝试完成无效交易时，将收取 0.01 SOL 罚款，这通常由盲目尝试铸造的机器人操作。为了防止 human 支付罚款，前端铸造应用程序需要验证目标 Candy Machine 是否有资格进行铸造。收集到的 Botting 惩罚将提供给 Candy Machine 实例的配置帐户。随后 Candy Machine 的创建者将自行决定如何使用从这些罚款中收取的资金。\n\n同时 Solana 生态系统的互连性是需要考虑的网络失败的重要因素。根据 SolanaFM 的报告，超过 39% Solana 的程序执行通过 Serum。对于 Mango Markets 和 Raydium，\n\n他们 13% 和 99% 的程序执行也被路由到 Serum。2022 年第一季度, Solana 中 50% 涉及 Serum 程序。这给 Solana 生态系统带来了巨大的例如 Serum 的单点故障风险, 如果涉及到流动性和交易问题, 那么多 Solana 上的核心 Defi 协议将会受到影响。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EQe7TmMv_qvX7U-McGX4E.png?height=533&width=1080)\n\n我们将在 Solana 的技术理解、设计框架、最新产品以及生态简介 (二) 中继续介绍其即将上线的几个 Meta 大公链竞品 (Aptos, Sui 等) ，生态情况以及更多观点分享。\n\n## Reference\n\n[Nansen Alpha Research](https://www.nansen.ai/nansen-alpha)\n\n[Solana docs](https://docs.solana.com/)\n\n[Solana mobile

In other words, it is based on the idea that decentralization is about the people and not private companies.**\n\n **Breaking Domain monopoly**\n\n**According to the 2021 Global Domain Report(InterNetX and Sedo), domain registrations are on the increase around the world with .com TLD leading the industry.** \n\n**However, there is a dark side of the domain industry that comes in the form of a monopoly by private companies like Ethos Capital which was recently indicted for ‘insider dealing’. The reality of this heavily corrupt and monopolised industry is made more evident by the fact the .com TLD has become the cash cow of a government backed monopoly whose profit is over %60.** \n\n**Why .dao TLD matters.**\n\n**Have you ever wondered what constitutes a domain name and why it is the the last thing you type in your browser’s URL bar!?**\n\n **The last string of letters preceding the last dot are the components of a registered domain name and they yet represent a powerful force in today’s digital world where building a strong online presence equates to finding the perfect domain name.**\n\n **In the analogical sense, a domain name(.com) is the address of a website(www.amazon) when it is compared to a house. It can also be described as the land where your website is located on the internet.**\n\n **It matters not just to businesses operating in the digital realm but also to web 3 builders to care about their domains and where they are hosted in order to gain visibility and a fair advantage in the domain industry.**\n\n **This is why creating an internet-native organisation to govern something as a significant as a domain name in the web 3 space might just be a way to rally the world to a noble cause through blockchain technology.**\n\n **Conclusion**\n\n **DomainDAO is set to become as a people-owned TLD space for DAOs in the web 3 ecosystem through the public registration of the .dao TLD which is a move to revolutinize the domain industry.**", "timestamp": 1658156446, "digest": "97oi0P495Ai7d8PmmJIAxDP_ADYUFE5ZRwYbrAnz-yg", "contributor": "0xDEb0e6f32e80694e998e6fAEd0Ace223f5945f89"}

They’re the ones in charge of providing Bilbao with clean water, as well as purifying the wastewater created.\n\nAs a product designer for DigitaLinkers, my task was to re-design their SCADA system (A SCADA is a central controller for industrial machinery).\n\nThis project is a continuation of CASE STUDY 1. In order to gain a better context, I’d recommend you to take a look at that one before reading this case study.\n\n![Initial screenshots of their SCADA system](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yijz8x1vmyWnI1ByZCXzA.png?height=1270&width=2461&size=medium)\n\nThe first part of the project was to design a dashboard that gave an overview of the plant’s processes. The second one was to improve the experience for the plant’s controllers, which is what this case is about.\n\n\\**This particular software is only available for Desktop, and they have a fixed resolution for their screens, which made responsive irrelevant for this project.*\n\n## Discovery\n\nWhen this project started, we had already covered some ground as part of the discovery phase. Nevertheless, we were still missing to talk to the heavy users of the software: the operations team.\n\nWe had a different sessions where we went through the flows and actions of each of the different operation profiles. When we were done, we came up with rules and constrains we’d need to follow and also identified some data that wasn’t necessary and we could get rid of.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. **Make the UI cleaner and easier to read.** Almost everybody agreed that the UI was very heavy to the eyes.\n2. **Improve the way alerts were displayed.** With some many graphical elements alerts were constantly missed or ignored.\n3. **Improve the flows and navigation.** They had inconsistent navigation patterns which result in users getting lost in the interface.\n\n## Hands on\n\n### Navigation\n\nThe first thing we did was to map the software structure, so we could define a proper navigation pattern. In the end, we went for a tree structure with a Breadcrumb, that would always let the user know where they were.\n\n### Colors\n\nAs we had already defined a color palette for the Dashboard project, we just inherited it and keep working with it.\n\n### Flows\n\nIn order to understand better the flows they had, we went for a full deconstruction of the screens and try and understand what they wanted to show.\n\n![Wireframe of one of the screens (One of the first iterations)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bomViWzwUF2erCSfmjsfr.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\nWe set a weekly iterative process, where I showed my progress on Friday, we went over it, discussed it and got some initial feedback, and then they sent all the final feedback on Tuesday. Then I’d present my progress on Friday, and so on.\n\n### Iconography\n\nAfter the flows were accepted, then we went to the icon design phase, where each of the elements should be clear, but at the same time abstract enough so that they could be easily placed in the system, reducing all the clutter the images they were using before created.\n\nThe biggest challenge here was to follow the guides and constrains from the software, so we had to come up with a system for displaying all kind of different status.\n\n![General structure for different cases for each of the elements](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gzZe_TikEnOlINgkskfGP.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\n## Design System\n\nOnce the iconography was put in place, we developed a system for the developers to follow it, so they could then build all of the software following it.\n\n![Before & after of one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgLEkCNDeK8TnY-81sFsI.png?height=1363&width=4863&size=medium)\n\nWe also created a UI Kit that was shared with them as a PDF. [You can check it here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12s6WQlfojBbAdWSwTUBJcampO6kTsd9j/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Final product\n\nIn the end, we created a design system for them to build their SCADA according to their needs (Alarms, different states, processes, CTAs, etc).\n\n![Final design for one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Y-KAPCB7YCJnohGr__tG.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\nThe project ended pretty well, on time, and the client is still happy with the result, which makes it a success :)", "timestamp": 1658156038, "digest": "F97mr8VqCgg1md2iV9Nq1a3InNTA6BzyFVLa9XlQmUU", "contributor": "0xaB0684A4AA2Bb286C7a6b7E7E9b5f660cb062A3d"}

O’Clock Capital将通过分析过往三轮牛市形成的具体原因，对下一轮牛市做出预测。\n\n## 一、三轮加密市场牛市上涨，在其中起着重要作用的都有谁？\n\n### 第一轮牛市: 2012年Q4～2013年Q4——匿名支付需求量的增加\n\n**2009年1月3日**，中本聪在芬兰使用小型服务器挖出了比特币创世区块，比特币由此诞生。\n\n**2010年5月22日**，佛罗里达程序员拉斯勒·豪涅茨，花10000比特币在“棒约翰”叫了两块匹萨外卖，从此比特币开始逐渐开启现实世界的使用。\n\n**2011年**，比特币开始在匿名支付领域被使用，但是直到2012年维基解密为了打破封锁，开始接收比特币的捐助，才使得比特币的使用范围大幅增加。\n\n随着比特币减半和丝绸之路2.0的开启，使得比特币供给相对减少，而需求进一步增加，比特币价格不断攀升，最终在2013年11月到达第一轮牛市最高点1163美金。\n\n**第一轮牛市最大的意义是比特币进入匿名支付领域，有了现实应用，并且带动了价格的蹿升。这使得挖矿变得越来越流行，参与者也随之增多，由矿机和电力成本构建的经济模型开始运转，成为比特币底层的价值支撑，从而使得比特币减半对于价格影响增加。**\n\n### 第二轮牛市: 2016年Q3～2017年Q4——矿业的高速发展以及爱西欧吸引资金入场\n\n2015年矿业高速发展，国内的鱼池与蚂蚁矿池形成了两强相争的局面，这两家矿池算力之和最高时达到了整个矿业算力的50%。这一时期大量资金购买矿机进入矿池挖矿，由于需求的增加，矿机得以以10倍于制造成本的价格来销售，并且是以期货的形式出售，这些相当于加了杠杆的资金大量进入加密市场，推高了比特币价格，反过来比特币价格上涨，又促进了矿机的销售，形成了上涨的螺旋。同期USDT出现，并且迅速被各大交易平台使用，尤其是在亚洲，他的桥梁作用和价值稳定性方便更多用户进入加密市场。这些原因导致的需求增加，以及比特币减半的到来，对于开启新的比特币牛市起到了关键作用。\n\n2014年7月的以太坊是迄今为止最大的“爱西欧”之一，筹措资金超过1800万美元。2015年以太坊为代表的智能合约区块链平台逐渐成熟，尤其是ERC-20协议只需短短几分钟就能创建出一个新的Token，此举大大降低了区块链创业和爱西欧发行的成本，爱西欧几乎成为区块链创业企业融资的标配。基于区块链技术的创业项目井喷，让没有赶上比特币红利的投资者开始把目光转向爱西欧，之后各种传统投资机构的不断入场，进一步将第二轮牛市从比特币牛市推向全面牛市。 \n \n\n2017年芝加哥期权交易平台（COBE）和芝加哥商品交易平台（CME）开放了比特币期货的交易，比特币第一次获得了主流金融市场的认可。最终在2017年12月比特币到达第二轮牛市的最高点19666美金。\n\n**第二轮牛市中矿业高速发展，比特币基于挖矿经济模型产生的底层价值更加稳固，这使得比特币减半对于市场的影响进一步增加，另外杠杆资金的进入，以及后来的爱西欧引入大量场外资金共同促成了第二轮牛市。** \n \n\n**同时我们看到了牛市周期的一种模式：牛市初期比特币拉升，中期以太坊的发展又推动了全面牛市，牛市末期比特币进入传统金融将市场推向最高点。这种模式第一次在牛市周期中出现，这种模式对于未来走势预判有很大参考意义。** \n \n\n### 第三轮牛市：2020年Q2～2021年Q4——疫情环境下的美联储放水以及DeFi、NFT市场爆发\n\n2020年在新冠疫情影响下，美联储释放出“零利率+无限QE”的“金融核武器”，而且拜登一上台就提出了天量的 1.9 万亿美元新冠援助计划。对于金融市场而言，拜登的 1.9 万亿新冠援助计划，就像一个的巨大泡沫。在这样巨大的泡沫下，大量资金从传统金融资产外溢到加密市场，其表现就是大量机构开始配置加密资产。\n\n**机构投资者主导了牛市初期的上涨，最具有代表性的就是灰度。**灰度（GrayScale）创立于2013 年9 月25 日，是一家加密货币信托基金公司，也是加密领域最早入局者之一，其作为加密资产的管理者，帮助投资者做资产管理。它首先从合格投资人那里募集资金，募集的资金用以购买加密资产，然后将它们划分为份额，从而生成了灰度的加密投资产品，如GBTC、ETHE。灰度允许其最初创建份额的加密资产投资者（严格的合格投资人身份验证）在禁售期后可以向公众出售。\n\n公众购买灰度的加密资产产品，可以通过传统的经纪和退休金账户进行购买，而且在税收、资产保管等方面存在好处。另外灰度的这些加密资产份额也是可转让的，交易者或投资者购买之后也可以通过交易获利。这一时期大批传统机构和投资者进入加密市场，比特币价格快速上涨。\n\n**当机构主导的比特币拉升后，市场进入牛市中期，DeFi成为市场上涨的主要影响力量。**DeFi 对于应用场景的拓展进一步推升并支撑了比特币牛市。在此时期相较于比特币，机构对以太坊等DeFi领域的投资兴趣明显增加，并显示出多元化配置加密资产的倾向。之后由于以太坊性能限制，其价值红利外溢到Solana、BSC、AVAX等竞争性公链。这使得加密市场从比特币牛市，进入到一个全面爆发的大牛市阶段。\n\n而且在这一时期，特斯拉表示，将对比特币投资 15 亿美元，也要开始接受比特币作为支付产品的一种形式。随后其创始人马斯克的不断“喊单”更加重了市场的fomo情绪，逐渐将市场推向高潮。 \n \n\n**在牛市末期，比特币期货ETF获批上市，NFT市场爆发，散户主导了最后的疯狂。**这一时期，在美国控制通胀需求增加，加息缩表预期提高情况下，美联储政策转向可能性增加，加密市场外部宏观经济最大的刺激因素逐渐消失。 \n \n\n在2021年10月至11月三只比特币期货ETF获批上市，市场迎来最后的疯狂，比特币价格推高至69000美金。同期NFT市场爆发，涌现出一批优质的蓝筹NFT，散户成为参与的主力军，而在这一过程中，很多聪明的资金逐渐离场。\n\n \n \n\n**综合近两轮牛市来看，虽然导致牛市产生的因素不同，但是牛市上涨结构呈现相似性，比特币率先上涨开始新的牛市，以太坊发展将比特币牛市推向加密行业全面牛市，在牛市末期，像上一轮的比特币期货和这一轮的比特币期货ETF上市，代表比特币被传统金融接纳，这将整个牛市推向顶峰，但比特币减半依然是牛市开始的重要时间节点。**\n\n \n \n\n## 二、未来影响加密市场走势的将会有谁？\n\n \n \n\n**通过上一部分的分析，我们基本确定了以比特币减半为时间节点的牛市发展的三个阶段，那么我们尝试利用这个规律来分析一下未来加密市场走势，也就是谁将影响比特币上涨和以太坊的发展未来。**\n\n \n \n\n### 美国经济对比特币价格走势的影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n目前加密市场已经与美国宏观经济产生高度关联性，尤其是比特币与标普500指数之间的相关性已经接近0.9，我们分析比特币走势不得不关注美国的经济状况。\n\n \n \n\n在今年3月16日，美国联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议决定提升联邦基金利率区间至0.25%-0.5%，开始了本轮加息。另据美联储官员预计，基准利率到2022年年底前将升至3.4%，这意味着今年还会再加息175个基点。\n\n \n \n\n我们回顾美联储最近的三次加息周期分别发生在 1999/06-2000/05、2004/06-2006/06、2015/12-2018/12，近三次加息周期内美国经济整体均处在增长动能不断强化，同时通胀持续上行的阶段，即经济周期中的过热阶段。\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lq5GvT-AvJc8ao1C6k-HO.png?height=197&width=363)\n\n \n \n\n美联储每次开启新一轮加息周期时，股市在短期内均有不同程度的回调，其中标普500最大回调幅度在 5%-15%之间，但拉长时间来看，整个加息周期内股市在经历了回调后，最终仍会随着基本面的好转而恢复上涨，走势呈“V型”。\n\n \n \n\n**那么我们就需要分析一下目前美国经济状况与近3次加息时是相似，还是将进入大的衰退？**\n\n \n \n\n目前美国出现近40年来的高通货膨胀率，同时伴随低失业率。这次通胀的核心原因是大宗商品价格上涨，而导致大宗商品价格大涨的主要原因是美元泛滥，一方面推高了以美元计价的大宗商品价格，另一方面热钱最终会涌入大宗商品交易市场，进一步推升大宗商品价格，所以美国只能通过加息以及缩表措施，希望使得大宗商品投资降温、降价。\n\n \n \n\n在美国经济体系中消费占主导，作为消费的重要领先指标，就业市场可直接反映经济景气变化。目前美国非农就业人口新增稳定，劳动力供需关系折射美国经济韧性，中短期不会成为美联储政策收紧的掣肘因素。即美联储通过加息以及缩表压制通货膨胀之后，失业率即使上升，应该能在接受范围之内，经济进入大萧条概率较小。\n\n \n \n\n**综合来看，本次加息与之前三次所处经济状况没有太大不同，那么依据前三次规律分析，美联储加息从3月开始，下半年标普500可能触底反弹，比特币也可能将完成本轮熊市筑底。**\n\n \n \n\n### 以太坊技术发展对加密市场走势的影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n在上一轮牛市中，以太坊主网在使用人数增多时，出现了拥堵和高gas的情况，这对于生态发展产生了非常大的阻碍，而且后期资金利用率低的缺点也显现出来。以太坊扩容和基于DID系统的信用金融体系成为急需解决的问题。\n\n \n \n\n目前以太坊正在进行升级，测试网合并已经完成，之后将进行以太坊主网合并（Merge）， PoW 将切换成 PoS。合并完成之后的首要重大事项就是 EIP-4844，利用分片使rollups处理巨量的交易来增加可扩展性。Arbitrum、Optimism、zksync、StarkNet、 Polygon 这些layer2项目都可以从 EIP-4844 中获得巨大进展，这将使得越来越多的开发者涌入。\n\n \n \n\n以太坊扩容，以及其他公链的发展将为web3.0的发展打下基础，而web3.0 最初可能将是平行于现实世界的一个虚拟经济体，在这个新的经济体中，会有新的行业诞生，也会对已有行业进行重新塑造。基于DID 所建立的信用体系和声誉体系，将解决目前DeFi超额抵押导致的资金利用率低的问题。而且隐私、DAO、NFT、Gamefi 、Socalfi等赛道也必将全面爆发，这会将比特币牛市推向加密市场全面牛市。\n\n## 三、下一轮牛市全周期的预测，以及牛市对于行业内部和外部影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n我们利用比特币的历史价格周期规律，结合上面我们分析的原因来对下一个牛市周期做一个简单的分析预测。\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VsDd3QkOB7uv1WbxFERhD.png?height=803&width=1814)\n\n \n \n\n首先我们看比特币前两轮牛市顶点到熊市最低点回调周期和深度，统计显示：\n\n**第一轮牛市从最高点到熊市最低点，下跌了14个月，回调幅度87.06%**\n\n**第二轮牛市从最高点到熊市最低点，下跌了12个月，回调幅度84.78%**\n\n**第二次下跌周期和幅度较第一次都有缩短，那么基于此，本次回调至最低点的周期可能会小于12个月，回调幅度可能小于84.78%。**\n\n \n \n\n**结合上面标普500走势分析，我们认为比特币本轮熊市最低点可能出现在9-10月份，最低点价格可能在14000美金到15000美金区域。**\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A2gsmSB0AVgjERxcr_ZHa.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n \n \n\n前面已经分析过比特币减半是之后牛市开启的重要节点，每次减半之后都伴随着更大的牛市，在比特币熊市最低点到减半中间这段时间，我们可以认为是比特币调整时期，在这一时期比特币价格大体震荡略有上行。对于这个时间周期统计显示：\n\n \n \n\n**第一轮熊市最低点到减半，调整18个月**\n\n**第二轮熊市最低点到减半，调整16个月**\n\n \n \n\n**比特币下一次减半大约发生在2024年5月，在比特币触底到减半这段时间将是调整周期，而美国加息可能在今年底或者明年初结束，之后市场也进入恢复期。**\n\n \n \n\n**综合以上两点，我们预测这一时期，美股和比特币都将进入调整期。可以预判机构可能在此时期建仓，但是大幅震荡中散户可能失去信心而离场。**\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OksEN7E6Mpz4YLk7gdhC2.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n \n \n\n在减半完成后比特币开始进入拉升阶段，我们可以看下比特币减半后到牛市最高点的周期和幅度的统计：\n\n \n \n\n**第一轮牛市上涨了13个月，上涨倍数是523.87**\n\n**第二轮牛市上涨了17个月，上涨倍数是129.04**\n\n**第三轮牛市上涨了19个月，上涨倍数是 22.09**\n\n \n \n\n**从上面数据看出，每轮牛市上涨周期在增加，上涨倍数由于基数变大，在不断缩小。那么我们可以推测2024年5月之后，比特币将进入拉升阶段。随后以太坊在完成升级后，基于技术提升，生态必将更加丰富，资金利用率必然提高，整个web3.0的应用层开始爆发，这时将进入加密市场全面牛市。我们预计本轮牛市比特币上涨至最高点可能需要超过19个月的时间，上涨倍数可能低于22倍，即最高价格不超过30万美金。最终比特币现货ETF也将通过，加密市场和传统金融进一步融合。**\n\n \n \n\n综合来看，我们认为**下一轮加密市场**牛市的**内在驱动力**就是狭义的**web3.0发展**，即基于区块链技术的全新互联网进行迭代发展。**它将带来的是互联网端的生产关系革新，生产关系的变革必然也会带来生产力的创新，这将是未来互联网的发展动力**。可以预见，未来必然会有更多资本进入加密行业，成熟的加密行业应用也将开始进入人们的日常生活。\n\n \n \n\n对于在本轮牛市中崛起的NFT，可能会首先进入人们的日常生活。而基于NFT发展的Gamefi 、Socalfi也会慢慢颠覆web2.0的模式。**而且狭义的web3.0只是web3.0的初期，包括区块链、元宇宙、VR/AR、人工智能的广义web3.0必然跟随发展，这将是软件和硬件设施共同带来的科技革命。做时间的朋友，耐心等待，该来的终究会来。**\n\n \n \n\n7 O'Clock

\n\n2017年芝加哥期权交易平台（COBE）和芝加哥商品交易平台（CME）开放了比特币期货的交易，比特币第一次获得了主流金融市场的认可。最终在2017年12月比特币到达第二轮牛市的最高点19666美金。\n\n**第二轮牛市中矿业高速发展，比特币基于挖矿经济模型产生的底层价值更加稳固，这使得比特币减半对于市场的影响进一步增加，另外杠杆资金的进入，以及后来的爱西欧引入大量场外资金共同促成了第二轮牛市。** \n \n\n**同时我们看到了牛市周期的一种模式：牛市初期比特币拉升，中期以太坊的发展又推动了全面牛市，牛市末期比特币进入传统金融将市场推向最高点。这种模式第一次在牛市周期中出现，这种模式对于未来走势预判有很大参考意义。** \n \n\n### 第三轮牛市：2020年Q2～2021年Q4——疫情环境下的美联储放水以及DeFi、NFT市场爆发\n\n2020年在新冠疫情影响下，美联储释放出“零利率+无限QE”的“金融核武器”，而且拜登一上台就提出了天量的 1.9 万亿美元新冠援助计划。对于金融市场而言，拜登的 1.9 万亿新冠援助计划，就像一个的巨大泡沫。在这样巨大的泡沫下，大量资金从传统金融资产外溢到加密市场，其表现就是大量机构开始配置加密资产。\n\n**机构投资者主导了牛市初期的上涨，最具有代表性的就是灰度。**灰度（GrayScale）创立于2013 年9 月25 日，是一家加密货币信托基金公司，也是加密领域最早入局者之一，其作为加密资产的管理者，帮助投资者做资产管理。它首先从合格投资人那里募集资金，募集的资金用以购买加密资产，然后将它们划分为份额，从而生成了灰度的加密投资产品，如GBTC、ETHE。灰度允许其最初创建份额的加密资产投资者（严格的合格投资人身份验证）在禁售期后可以向公众出售。\n\n公众购买灰度的加密资产产品，可以通过传统的经纪和退休金账户进行购买，而且在税收、资产保管等方面存在好处。另外灰度的这些加密资产份额也是可转让的，交易者或投资者购买之后也可以通过交易获利。这一时期大批传统机构和投资者进入加密市场，比特币价格快速上涨。\n\n**当机构主导的比特币拉升后，市场进入牛市中期，DeFi成为市场上涨的主要影响力量。**DeFi 对于应用场景的拓展进一步推升并支撑了比特币牛市。在此时期相较于比特币，机构对以太坊等DeFi领域的投资兴趣明显增加，并显示出多元化配置加密资产的倾向。之后由于以太坊性能限制，其价值红利外溢到Solana、BSC、AVAX等竞争性公链。这使得加密市场从比特币牛市，进入到一个全面爆发的大牛市阶段。\n\n而且在这一时期，特斯拉表示，将对比特币投资 15 亿美元，也要开始接受比特币作为支付产品的一种形式。随后其创始人马斯克的不断“喊单”更加重了市场的fomo情绪，逐渐将市场推向高潮。 \n \n\n**在牛市末期，比特币期货ETF获批上市，NFT市场爆发，散户主导了最后的疯狂。**这一时期，在美国控制通胀需求增加，加息缩表预期提高情况下，美联储政策转向可能性增加，加密市场外部宏观经济最大的刺激因素逐渐消失。 \n \n\n在2021年10月至11月三只比特币期货ETF获批上市，市场迎来最后的疯狂，比特币价格推高至69000美金。同期NFT市场爆发，涌现出一批优质的蓝筹NFT，散户成为参与的主力军，而在这一过程中，很多聪明的资金逐渐离场。\n\n \n \n\n**综合近两轮牛市来看，虽然导致牛市产生的因素不同，但是牛市上涨结构呈现相似性，比特币率先上涨开始新的牛市，以太坊发展将比特币牛市推向加密行业全面牛市，在牛市末期，像上一轮的比特币期货和这一轮的比特币期货ETF上市，代表比特币被传统金融接纳，这将整个牛市推向顶峰，但比特币减半依然是牛市开始的重要时间节点。**\n\n \n \n\n## 二、未来影响加密市场走势的将会有谁？\n\n \n \n\n**通过上一部分的分析，我们基本确定了以比特币减半为时间节点的牛市发展的三个阶段，那么我们尝试利用这个规律来分析一下未来加密市场走势，也就是谁将影响比特币上涨和以太坊的发展未来。**\n\n \n \n\n### 美国经济对比特币价格走势的影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n目前加密市场已经与美国宏观经济产生高度关联性，尤其是比特币与标普500指数之间的相关性已经接近0.9，我们分析比特币走势不得不关注美国的经济状况。\n\n \n \n\n在今年3月16日，美国联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议决定提升联邦基金利率区间至0.25%-0.5%，开始了本轮加息。另据美联储官员预计，基准利率到2022年年底前将升至3.4%，这意味着今年还会再加息175个基点。\n\n \n \n\n我们回顾美联储最近的三次加息周期分别发生在 1999/06-2000/05、2004/06-2006/06、2015/12-2018/12，近三次加息周期内美国经济整体均处在增长动能不断强化，同时通胀持续上行的阶段，即经济周期中的过热阶段。\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lq5GvT-AvJc8ao1C6k-HO.png?height=197&width=363)\n\n \n \n\n美联储每次开启新一轮加息周期时，股市在短期内均有不同程度的回调，其中标普500最大回调幅度在 5%-15%之间，但拉长时间来看，整个加息周期内股市在经历了回调后，最终仍会随着基本面的好转而恢复上涨，走势呈“V型”。\n\n \n \n\n**那么我们就需要分析一下目前美国经济状况与近3次加息时是相似，还是将进入大的衰退？**\n\n \n \n\n目前美国出现近40年来的高通货膨胀率，同时伴随低失业率。这次通胀的核心原因是大宗商品价格上涨，而导致大宗商品价格大涨的主要原因是美元泛滥，一方面推高了以美元计价的大宗商品价格，另一方面热钱最终会涌入大宗商品交易市场，进一步推升大宗商品价格，所以美国只能通过加息以及缩表措施，希望使得大宗商品投资降温、降价。\n\n \n \n\n在美国经济体系中消费占主导，作为消费的重要领先指标，就业市场可直接反映经济景气变化。目前美国非农就业人口新增稳定，劳动力供需关系折射美国经济韧性，中短期不会成为美联储政策收紧的掣肘因素。即美联储通过加息以及缩表压制通货膨胀之后，失业率即使上升，应该能在接受范围之内，经济进入大萧条概率较小。\n\n \n \n\n**综合来看，本次加息与之前三次所处经济状况没有太大不同，那么依据前三次规律分析，美联储加息从3月开始，下半年标普500可能触底反弹，比特币也可能将完成本轮熊市筑底。**\n\n \n \n\n### 以太坊技术发展对加密市场走势的影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n在上一轮牛市中，以太坊主网在使用人数增多时，出现了拥堵和高gas的情况，这对于生态发展产生了非常大的阻碍，而且后期资金利用率低的缺点也显现出来。以太坊扩容和基于DID系统的信用金融体系成为急需解决的问题。\n\n \n \n\n目前以太坊正在进行升级，测试网合并已经完成，之后将进行以太坊主网合并（Merge）， PoW 将切换成 PoS。合并完成之后的首要重大事项就是 EIP-4844，利用分片使rollups处理巨量的交易来增加可扩展性。Arbitrum、Optimism、zksync、StarkNet、 Polygon 这些layer2项目都可以从 EIP-4844 中获得巨大进展，这将使得越来越多的开发者涌入。\n\n \n \n\n以太坊扩容，以及其他公链的发展将为web3.0的发展打下基础，而web3.0 最初可能将是平行于现实世界的一个虚拟经济体，在这个新的经济体中，会有新的行业诞生，也会对已有行业进行重新塑造。基于DID 所建立的信用体系和声誉体系，将解决目前DeFi超额抵押导致的资金利用率低的问题。而且隐私、DAO、NFT、Gamefi 、Socalfi等赛道也必将全面爆发，这会将比特币牛市推向加密市场全面牛市。\n\n## 三、下一轮牛市全周期的预测，以及牛市对于行业内部和外部影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n我们利用比特币的历史价格周期规律，结合上面我们分析的原因来对下一个牛市周期做一个简单的分析预测。\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VsDd3QkOB7uv1WbxFERhD.png?height=803&width=1814)\n\n \n \n\n首先我们看比特币前两轮牛市顶点到熊市最低点回调周期和深度，统计显示：\n\n**第一轮牛市从最高点到熊市最低点，下跌了14个月，回调幅度87.06%**\n\n**第二轮牛市从最高点到熊市最低点，下跌了12个月，回调幅度84.78%**\n\n**第二次下跌周期和幅度较第一次都有缩短，那么基于此，本次回调至最低点的周期可能会小于12个月，回调幅度可能小于84.78%。**\n\n \n \n\n**结合上面标普500走势分析，我们认为比特币本轮熊市最低点可能出现在9-10月份，最低点价格可能在14000美金到15000美金区域。**\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A2gsmSB0AVgjERxcr_ZHa.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n \n \n\n前面已经分析过比特币减半是之后牛市开启的重要节点，每次减半之后都伴随着更大的牛市，在比特币熊市最低点到减半中间这段时间，我们可以认为是比特币调整时期，在这一时期比特币价格大体震荡略有上行。对于这个时间周期统计显示：\n\n \n \n\n**第一轮熊市最低点到减半，调整18个月**\n\n**第二轮熊市最低点到减半，调整16个月**\n\n \n \n\n**比特币下一次减半大约发生在2024年5月，在比特币触底到减半这段时间将是调整周期，而美国加息可能在今年底或者明年初结束，之后市场也进入恢复期。**\n\n \n \n\n**综合以上两点，我们预测这一时期，美股和比特币都将进入调整期。可以预判机构可能在此时期建仓，但是大幅震荡中散户可能失去信心而离场。**\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OksEN7E6Mpz4YLk7gdhC2.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n \n \n\n在减半完成后比特币开始进入拉升阶段，我们可以看下比特币减半后到牛市最高点的周期和幅度的统计：\n\n \n \n\n**第一轮牛市上涨了13个月，上涨倍数是523.87**\n\n**第二轮牛市上涨了17个月，上涨倍数是129.04**\n\n**第三轮牛市上涨了19个月，上涨倍数是 22.09**\n\n \n \n\n**从上面数据看出，每轮牛市上涨周期在增加，上涨倍数由于基数变大，在不断缩小。那么我们可以推测2024年5月之后，比特币将进入拉升阶段。随后以太坊在完成升级后，基于技术提升，生态必将更加丰富，资金利用率必然提高，整个web3.0的应用层开始爆发，这时将进入加密市场全面牛市。我们预计本轮牛市比特币上涨至最高点可能需要超过19个月的时间，上涨倍数可能低于22倍，即最高价格不超过30万美金。最终比特币现货ETF也将通过，加密市场和传统金融进一步融合。**\n\n \n \n\n综合来看，我们认为**下一轮加密市场**牛市的**内在驱动力**就是狭义的**web3.0发展**，即基于区块链技术的全新互联网进行迭代发展。**它将带来的是互联网端的生产关系革新，生产关系的变革必然也会带来生产力的创新，这将是未来互联网的发展动力**。可以预见，未来必然会有更多资本进入加密行业，成熟的加密行业应用也将开始进入人们的日常生活。\n\n \n \n\n对于在本轮牛市中崛起的NFT，可能会首先进入人们的日常生活。而基于NFT发展的Gamefi 、Socalfi也会慢慢颠覆web2.0的模式。**而且狭义的web3.0只是web3.0的初期，包括区块链、元宇宙、VR/AR、人工智能的广义web3.0必然跟随发展，这将是软件和硬件设施共同带来的科技革命。做时间的朋友，耐心等待，该来的终究会来。**\n\n \n \n\n7 O'Clock

{"id": "ffiqECgJM4aLoHnKMY0Ol6hmNXGpTzWNukaVT3-mZ6Q", "title": "Festival of the Commons", "body": "I went to the first academic conference of my life and call me dramatic but it was such an emotional and profound experience for me, I’m literally bursting with emotions and that’s always a good reason to write. So I heard of this wonderful conference called SASE (The Society for the Advancement of Socioeconomics). I started following this organization and I saw that for 2022 the conference theme was going to be super intriguing. It was “Fractious Connections: Anarchy, Activism, Coordination and Control.” How cool is that? So many concepts that I’m interested in and since when do we acknowledge anarchy as a possibility for social organization in formal academia? I thought that there was no way I could actually present there but I wanted to go through the process of applying anyway since I would do it in the future for sure. So I wrote my proposal and submitted it. When I got the acceptance email, I had to read it three times to believe that my proposal was actually accepted. I was shocked and thrilled and then terrified because what the hell was I going to do now? I couldn’t not go after being accepted, it’s such an opportunity! But what the fuck would I present if I did go? And this has been on my mind for months now. I tried so hard to figure out my thesis research question so that I could present it for the conference but I didn’t get very far with it because I barely had any guidance specific to my topic of interest. I felt so misunderstood and alone. I didn’t belong at my own university and I felt it very deeply. And I thrive on external validation so imagine how hard it was to not give up on my ideas when I never got any. It was a very teaching experience in that I had to learn to trust my own intuition and validate myself because there will not always be someone to do that for me, especially when you take up such a controversial cause in your life as finding an alternative to capitalism. I study at a fucking business school. Obviously, my opinions aren’t very well received there and I’m not encouraged to pursue the topics I want to. It’s a Sociology program where we talk about gender in binary terms and very often only use male data in our analyses. Or we talk about how to make workers more productive. Or immigrants more integrated into German culture. Or how the only valuable production of knowledge is strictly via the quantitative scientific method. I’ve learned a lot here but I’m so glad it’s over and I can be with my people soon. And I’ve only just discovered that my people exist at this conference, so you can imagine what a relief it was!\n\nSo I moved to Berlin a few weeks ago and this was my first step to save myself, it was difficult but I did it! And it was so worth it, I can’t even tell you how much my life and my mental state have improved since I moved here. I feel like I found my home, I feel like I belong, perhaps specifically because no one belongs here. And I never feel that way! This is so new and exciting for me, I’m so happy that things are finally starting to work out for me. Anyway, with my field experiment, my friends that I needed to say hello to, all the new people I’ve been meeting, all the summer events going on, looking for a house and moving and my current state of homelessness, it was pretty busy. I didn’t really have time to do much in preparation for the conference and with only a few days left last week I freaked out. My mind went rogue and turned on me, this is the first time that I very concretely understood what imposter syndrome is. The thoughts that were spiralling in my mind!\n\n“As always you left this for the last minute, wtf are you gonna do now?”\n\n“You’re going to the first conference of your life and you didn’t even prepare your presentation yet!”\n\n“What were you even thinking applying to such a conference, you don’t belong there! Who do you think you are?!”\n\n“You used some big sexy buzzwords in your proposal of a paper that doesn’t even exist and they thought you were actually someone to invite but you tricked them. You’re nothing. You’re shit. You’re a mere master’s student who can’t even come up with a decent research question.”\n\n“You don’t have the knowledge to back up anything you wrote on that proposal and they’re gonna see you for who you are. A little girl that doesn’t even know what she’s talking about.”\n\n“Your ruse is going to be uncovered and you’re going to be humiliated. They’re gonna ask you questions and you’re not even gonna understand the question, let alone be able to give an intelligent answer to it.”\n\n“Just say you have covid and don’t show up. You don’t have to go and its so much stress, why do that to yourself?”\n\nAnd so on. You can see how cruel my mind is to me sometimes. But I’m deeply grateful for my beloved friends and family because they’re the ones that got me through it. So many positive affirmations and comforting words of encouragement. We incorporated a demo presentation into our weekly game night and I presented to my friends and they gave me so much helpful feedback. Now they also know what DAOs are and we have the idea of turning this “learning event” into a regular thing where we can all share interesting knowledge and experiences we gain in our individual lives. I love it! And I want to share some of the encouraging words they shared with me, that helped to shut up my inner saboteur.\n\n“If you don’t know something there’s nothing more natural and honest than to just say I don’t know, and there’s nothing to be ashamed about.”\n\n“You have all of the space to make any mistake you want, that’s the good part about first experiences.”\n\n“Well, we’re all imposters when you think about it. No one knows what they’re doing, we’re just going around pretending. Especially in academia.”\n\n“I have full faith that you’re going to rock this thing!”\n\n“You actually might fuck up, you know. It happens. And that’s completely okay, you’re allowed to fuck up.”\n\nAnd so much more. So I ended up going, thankfully. I was still very stressed out up to the last minute. And so much went wrong on the morning of my presentation, I just wanted to get it over with. But looking back I now know there was nothing to be afraid of. Everyone was just human. And very kind human beings at that. They were encouraging, supportive and interested. No one made a mean comment at all. There was negative feedback but it was all very constructive and considerate. And I think I did a good job! Both with the presentation and the questions after it. The negative feedback was nothing compared with all the positive feedback I got! I’m still shocked by the experience. And conferences apparently aren’t really about the papers being represented, they’re more about connecting and reconnecting. We share our ideas and talk and have fun together, we become friends. That’s the real beauty of it, it’s a social experience! And I’ve always loved the collective & social part of academia, this is a whole new level of it. So it was truly a transformative and profound experience for me.\n\nSo I’m gonna get a little emotional. It was a gathering of brilliant passionate nerds out to save the world, a thousand of them. They were scholars, they were activists, they were artists, they were comrades, they were warriors, they were full of hope and doubt, they were beautiful human beings and most importantly they were friends. After the isolation I have gotten accustomed to in my struggle, the loneliness, the crippling self-doubt, the hopelessness… finding this community changes everything. I’m not alone anymore and there are thousands of others out there fighting for the same things. The way we instantly connected was pure magic. We understood each other on such a deep level: the humor, the struggle, the coping mechanisms, the hope, the hopelessness, the things we read, the things we watch, the way we perceive life and what we want from it. I’ve never experienced something like this before. I feel like I found my people, it was so comfortable to be amongst them, and these are people that I literally just met. I knew exactly what to say around them and it was what I wanted to say, I knew I would be accepted for exactly who I am. We were united under a common purpose and struggle and everything else was irrelevant. We were from all over the world and from different backgrounds and ages and genders, but we were able to form a community. Not only do we already agree collectively that the world as we know it is fucked up, we also agree that that can be changed and that responsibility lies with us, and we have come together to discuss how we can do it. We’ve all devoted our lives to actively and passionately seeking out Alternatives to Capitalism and we’re in it together. I kinda grew up this weekend, these wonderful “adults” listened to me, they gave me the opportunity and space to express myself and my ideas resonated with them. They took me in as an equal. I am an adult, I am a sociologist, I am a scholar, I am an academic, I am an activist, I am an artist! And no one in the world can take that away from me. Despite the words of my inner saboteur, I am not an imposter and I deserve to exist and to be here just as much as anyone else and my ideas are worthy of recognition and praise. Do you realize how valuable this realization is? What an experience, I just can’t get over it. I’m bursting with so many emotions. It was stimulating, thought-provoking, inspiring, liberating, motivating, encouraging, overwhelming, comforting and it was a hell of a lot of fun! It was, in fact, a festival! But of ideas… and with a spirit of sweet sweet solidarity!\n\nI must say that there was a difference between our network and the others. We were kinda like the cool kids of the conference. The gender, age, and nationality distribution of the participants was very diverse, much more than in the other networks. I guess the concept of alternatives to capitalism attracts good people. And interesting people. Apparently normally we don’t just do the conference but we visit local communities, collectives, squats and just do other activities while we’re there. Our wonderful organizers are considering having a more informal event to meet at Christiania in Copenhagen. That would be SO MUCH FUN! I’m so happy to have found them and I will not let them go. Not only was the conference itself great, but I also had so much inspiration for my future plans. LibraryDAO is going to have such gatherings but they’re going to be even better. It will be a Festival of the Commons, an anarchist gathering where the structure of the events will be determined in a bottom-up, flexible fashion. I guess most fo us have heard of the tragedy of the commons. The problem of self-interest that leads to overexploitation when you’re sharing a depletable public good. Well, we’re gonna celebrate love and friendship and knowledge and art. None of which are depletable goods, they are economies of abundance, they will increase the more we share them. So we will have a festival of the commons! Which is not my concept btw, I stole it because I like it too much :) There’s so much we could do. It will resemble a festival even more than a traditional conference does. There will be creative activities and performances. We’ll turn the world upside down in our own little bubble. We won’t only consume together but we’ll also create together. We’ll share, we’ll sing, we’ll dance, we’ll play games! Fun will be built into the experience. I’m so excited!", "timestamp": 1658157316, "digest": "dlUxgXHu2yweSwBqWdoshjT8uZqH-PhctQIdCmRRmvY", "contributor": "0x2f41bC4A15662d341CCF866CF1603568923D170A"}

In order to gain a better context, I’d recommend you to take a look at that one before reading this case study.\n\n![Initial screenshots of their SCADA system](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yijz8x1vmyWnI1ByZCXzA.png?height=1270&width=2461&size=medium)\n\nThe first part of the project was to design a dashboard that gave an overview of the plant’s processes. The second one was to improve the experience for the plant’s controllers, which is what this case is about.\n\n\\**This particular software is only available for Desktop, and they have a fixed resolution for their screens, which made responsive irrelevant for this project.*\n\n## Discovery\n\nWhen this project started, we had already covered some ground as part of the discovery phase. Nevertheless, we were still missing to talk to the heavy users of the software: the operations team.\n\nWe had a different sessions where we went through the flows and actions of each of the different operation profiles. When we were done, we came up with rules and constrains we’d need to follow and also identified some data that wasn’t necessary and we could get rid of.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. **Make the UI cleaner and easier to read.** Almost everybody agreed that the UI was very heavy to the eyes.\n2. **Improve the way alerts were displayed.** With some many graphical elements alerts were constantly missed or ignored.\n3. **Improve the flows and navigation.** They had inconsistent navigation patterns which result in users getting lost in the interface.\n\n## Hands on\n\n### Navigation\n\nThe first thing we did was to map the software structure, so we could define a proper navigation pattern. In the end, we went for a tree structure with a Breadcrumb, that would always let the user know where they were.\n\n### Colors\n\nAs we had already defined a color palette for the Dashboard project, we just inherited it and keep working with it.\n\n### Flows\n\nIn order to understand better the flows they had, we went for a full deconstruction of the screens and try and understand what they wanted to show.\n\n![Wireframe of one of the screens (One of the first iterations)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bomViWzwUF2erCSfmjsfr.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\nWe set a weekly iterative process, where I showed my progress on Friday, we went over it, discussed it and got some initial feedback, and then they sent all the final feedback on Tuesday. Then I’d present my progress on Friday, and so on.\n\n### Iconography\n\nAfter the flows were accepted, then we went to the icon design phase, where each of the elements should be clear, but at the same time abstract enough so that they could be easily placed in the system, reducing all the clutter the images they were using before created.\n\nThe biggest challenge here was to follow the guides and constrains from the software, so we had to come up with a system for displaying all kind of different status.\n\n![General structure for different cases for each of the elements](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gzZe_TikEnOlINgkskfGP.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\n## Design System\n\nOnce the iconography was put in place, we developed a system for the developers to follow it, so they could then build all of the software following it.\n\n![Before & after of one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgLEkCNDeK8TnY-81sFsI.png?height=1363&width=4863&size=medium)\n\nWe also created a UI Kit that was shared with them as a PDF. [You can check it here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12s6WQlfojBbAdWSwTUBJcampO6kTsd9j/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Final product\n\nIn the end, we created a design system for them to build their SCADA according to their needs (Alarms, different states, processes, CTAs, etc).\n\n![Final design for one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Y-KAPCB7YCJnohGr__tG.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\nThe main improved areas were:\n\n### Made the UI cleaner and easier to read\n\nOur approach was to make the interface as clean and abstract as possible, giving more importance to actionable items than to what was working properly. This gave the operations people a clear state of their process, and told them what they had to do.\n\n### Improved the way alerts were displayed\n\nWe reduced the clutter with alerts by creating a framework for categories of them. Also, we used the red color as the alert one, generating a lot of contrast and letting the user know when something wasn’t working, right away.\n\n### Improved the flows and navigation\n\nAs part of the Information Architecture, we blended some views and separated others. We also added a proper breadcrumb with a tree view of the site, where the users is aware of where they are, all the time.\n\n### Design system in place\n\nWhen the project was done, the developers had a system that they could use to build the whole system by themselves. Until today, they haven’t asked for clarification or guidance for anything, which means the system is working properly.", "timestamp": 1658157125, "digest": "DMcT40AcNXgVsozmYQy7tJqZCbXZxPpz02deOfuA9SE", "contributor": "0xaB0684A4AA2Bb286C7a6b7E7E9b5f660cb062A3d"}

《韩非子·解老》*\n\n**引言**：华尔街有一句名言，平庸的交易者用技术交易，顶尖的交易者用信念交易。信念的产生是源于对于规律的认知，掌握事物发展的规律，合理布局是我们在市场生存的重要条件。\n\n加密市场也正在按照自身的规律不断向前发展，比特币已经历三轮牛市，但是引发每一轮牛市产生的具体要素有所不同。不过我们能够清晰的看到，比特币减半都成了牛市到来的重要节点，而以太坊技术的发展、传统资金的流入、金融杠杆的增加使得市场进入全面牛市。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/15oQiFWF_pV_LyHg4laAh.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n下文7 O’Clock Capital将通过分析过往三轮牛市形成的具体原因，对下一轮牛市做出预测。\n\n## 一、三轮加密市场牛市上涨，在其中起着重要作用的都有谁？\n\n### 第一轮牛市: 2012年Q4～2013年Q4——匿名支付需求量的增加\n\n**2009年1月3日**，中本聪在芬兰使用小型服务器挖出了比特币创世区块，比特币由此诞生。\n\n**2010年5月22日**，佛罗里达程序员拉斯勒·豪涅茨，花10000比特币在“棒约翰”叫了两块匹萨外卖，从此比特币开始逐渐开启现实世界的使用。\n\n**2011年**，比特币开始在匿名支付领域被使用，但是直到2012年维基解密为了打破封锁，开始接收比特币的捐助，才使得比特币的使用范围大幅增加。\n\n随着比特币减半和丝绸之路2.0的开启，使得比特币供给相对减少，而需求进一步增加，比特币价格不断攀升，最终在2013年11月到达第一轮牛市最高点1163美金。\n\n**第一轮牛市最大的意义是比特币进入匿名支付领域，有了现实应用，并且带动了价格的蹿升。这使得挖矿变得越来越流行，参与者也随之增多，由矿机和电力成本构建的经济模型开始运转，成为比特币底层的价值支撑，从而使得比特币减半对于价格影响增加。**\n\n### 第二轮牛市: 2016年Q3～2017年Q4——矿业的高速发展以及爱西欧吸引资金入场\n\n2015年矿业高速发展，国内的鱼池与蚂蚁矿池形成了两强相争的局面，这两家矿池算力之和最高时达到了整个矿业算力的50%。这一时期大量资金购买矿机进入矿池挖矿，由于需求的增加，矿机得以以10倍于制造成本的价格来销售，并且是以期货的形式出售，这些相当于加了杠杆的资金大量进入加密市场，推高了比特币价格，反过来比特币价格上涨，又促进了矿机的销售，形成了上涨的螺旋。同期USDT出现，并且迅速被各大交易平台使用，尤其是在亚洲，他的桥梁作用和价值稳定性方便更多用户进入加密市场。这些原因导致的需求增加，以及比特币减半的到来，对于开启新的比特币牛市起到了关键作用。\n\n2014年7月的以太坊是迄今为止最大的“爱西欧”之一，筹措资金超过1800万美元。2015年以太坊为代表的智能合约区块链平台逐渐成熟，尤其是ERC-20协议只需短短几分钟就能创建出一个新的Token，此举大大降低了区块链创业和爱西欧发行的成本，爱西欧几乎成为区块链创业企业融资的标配。基于区块链技术的创业项目井喷，让没有赶上比特币红利的投资者开始把目光转向爱西欧，之后各种传统投资机构的不断入场，进一步将第二轮牛市从比特币牛市推向全面牛市。 \n \n\n2017年芝加哥期权交易平台（COBE）和芝加哥商品交易平台（CME）开放了比特币期货的交易，比特币第一次获得了主流金融市场的认可。最终在2017年12月比特币到达第二轮牛市的最高点19666美金。\n\n**第二轮牛市中矿业高速发展，比特币基于挖矿经济模型产生的底层价值更加稳固，这使得比特币减半对于市场的影响进一步增加，另外杠杆资金的进入，以及后来的爱西欧引入大量场外资金共同促成了第二轮牛市。** \n \n\n**同时我们看到了牛市周期的一种模式：牛市初期比特币拉升，中期以太坊的发展又推动了全面牛市，牛市末期比特币进入传统金融将市场推向最高点。这种模式第一次在牛市周期中出现，这种模式对于未来走势预判有很大参考意义。** \n \n\n### 第三轮牛市：2020年Q2～2021年Q4——疫情环境下的美联储放水以及DeFi、NFT市场爆发\n\n2020年在新冠疫情影响下，美联储释放出“零利率+无限QE”的“金融核武器”，而且拜登一上台就提出了天量的 1.9 万亿美元新冠援助计划。对于金融市场而言，拜登的 1.9 万亿新冠援助计划，就像一个的巨大泡沫。在这样巨大的泡沫下，大量资金从传统金融资产外溢到加密市场，其表现就是大量机构开始配置加密资产。\n\n**机构投资者主导了牛市初期的上涨，最具有代表性的就是灰度。**灰度（GrayScale）创立于2013 年9 月25 日，是一家加密货币信托基金公司，也是加密领域最早入局者之一，其作为加密资产的管理者，帮助投资者做资产管理。它首先从合格投资人那里募集资金，募集的资金用以购买加密资产，然后将它们划分为份额，从而生成了灰度的加密投资产品，如GBTC、ETHE。灰度允许其最初创建份额的加密资产投资者（严格的合格投资人身份验证）在禁售期后可以向公众出售。\n\n公众购买灰度的加密资产产品，可以通过传统的经纪和退休金账户进行购买，而且在税收、资产保管等方面存在好处。另外灰度的这些加密资产份额也是可转让的，交易者或投资者购买之后也可以通过交易获利。这一时期大批传统机构和投资者进入加密市场，比特币价格快速上涨。\n\n**当机构主导的比特币拉升后，市场进入牛市中期，DeFi成为市场上涨的主要影响力量。**DeFi 对于应用场景的拓展进一步推升并支撑了比特币牛市。在此时期相较于比特币，机构对以太坊等DeFi领域的投资兴趣明显增加，并显示出多元化配置加密资产的倾向。之后由于以太坊性能限制，其价值红利外溢到Solana、BSC、AVAX等竞争性公链。这使得加密市场从比特币牛市，进入到一个全面爆发的大牛市阶段。\n\n而且在这一时期，特斯拉表示，将对比特币投资 15 亿美元，也要开始接受比特币作为支付产品的一种形式。随后其创始人马斯克的不断“喊单”更加重了市场的fomo情绪，逐渐将市场推向高潮。 \n \n\n**在牛市末期，比特币期货ETF获批上市，NFT市场爆发，散户主导了最后的疯狂。**这一时期，在美国控制通胀需求增加，加息缩表预期提高情况下，美联储政策转向可能性增加，加密市场外部宏观经济最大的刺激因素逐渐消失。 \n \n\n在2021年10月至11月三只比特币期货ETF获批上市，市场迎来最后的疯狂，比特币价格推高至69000美金。同期NFT市场爆发，涌现出一批优质的蓝筹NFT，散户成为参与的主力军，而在这一过程中，很多聪明的资金逐渐离场。\n\n \n \n\n**综合近两轮牛市来看，虽然导致牛市产生的因素不同，但是牛市上涨结构呈现相似性，比特币率先上涨开始新的牛市，以太坊发展将比特币牛市推向加密行业全面牛市，在牛市末期，像上一轮的比特币期货和这一轮的比特币期货ETF上市，代表比特币被传统金融接纳，这将整个牛市推向顶峰，但比特币减半依然是牛市开始的重要时间节点。**\n\n \n \n\n## 二、未来影响加密市场走势的将会有谁？\n\n \n \n\n**通过上一部分的分析，我们基本确定了以比特币减半为时间节点的牛市发展的三个阶段，那么我们尝试利用这个规律来分析一下未来加密市场走势，也就是谁将影响比特币上涨和以太坊的发展未来。**\n\n \n \n\n### 美国经济对比特币价格走势的影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n目前加密市场已经与美国宏观经济产生高度关联性，尤其是比特币与标普500指数之间的相关性已经接近0.9，我们分析比特币走势不得不关注美国的经济状况。\n\n \n \n\n在今年3月16日，美国联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议决定提升联邦基金利率区间至0.25%-0.5%，开始了本轮加息。另据美联储官员预计，基准利率到2022年年底前将升至3.4%，这意味着今年还会再加息175个基点。\n\n \n \n\n我们回顾美联储最近的三次加息周期分别发生在 1999/06-2000/05、2004/06-2006/06、2015/12-2018/12，近三次加息周期内美国经济整体均处在增长动能不断强化，同时通胀持续上行的阶段，即经济周期中的过热阶段。\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lq5GvT-AvJc8ao1C6k-HO.png?height=197&width=363)\n\n \n \n\n美联储每次开启新一轮加息周期时，股市在短期内均有不同程度的回调，其中标普500最大回调幅度在 5%-15%之间，但拉长时间来看，整个加息周期内股市在经历了回调后，最终仍会随着基本面的好转而恢复上涨，走势呈“V型”。\n\n \n \n\n**那么我们就需要分析一下目前美国经济状况与近3次加息时是相似，还是将进入大的衰退？**\n\n \n \n\n目前美国出现近40年来的高通货膨胀率，同时伴随低失业率。这次通胀的核心原因是大宗商品价格上涨，而导致大宗商品价格大涨的主要原因是美元泛滥，一方面推高了以美元计价的大宗商品价格，另一方面热钱最终会涌入大宗商品交易市场，进一步推升大宗商品价格，所以美国只能通过加息以及缩表措施，希望使得大宗商品投资降温、降价。\n\n \n \n\n在美国经济体系中消费占主导，作为消费的重要领先指标，就业市场可直接反映经济景气变化。目前美国非农就业人口新增稳定，劳动力供需关系折射美国经济韧性，中短期不会成为美联储政策收紧的掣肘因素。即美联储通过加息以及缩表压制通货膨胀之后，失业率即使上升，应该能在接受范围之内，经济进入大萧条概率较小。\n\n \n \n\n**综合来看，本次加息与之前三次所处经济状况没有太大不同，那么依据前三次规律分析，美联储加息从3月开始，下半年标普500可能触底反弹，比特币也可能将完成本轮熊市筑底。**\n\n \n \n\n### 以太坊技术发展对加密市场走势的影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n在上一轮牛市中，以太坊主网在使用人数增多时，出现了拥堵和高gas的情况，这对于生态发展产生了非常大的阻碍，而且后期资金利用率低的缺点也显现出来。以太坊扩容和基于DID系统的信用金融体系成为急需解决的问题。\n\n \n \n\n目前以太坊正在进行升级，测试网合并已经完成，之后将进行以太坊主网合并（Merge）， PoW 将切换成 PoS。合并完成之后的首要重大事项就是 EIP-4844，利用分片使rollups处理巨量的交易来增加可扩展性。Arbitrum、Optimism、zksync、StarkNet、 Polygon 这些layer2项目都可以从 EIP-4844 中获得巨大进展，这将使得越来越多的开发者涌入。\n\n \n \n\n以太坊扩容，以及其他公链的发展将为web3.0的发展打下基础，而web3.0 最初可能将是平行于现实世界的一个虚拟经济体，在这个新的经济体中，会有新的行业诞生，也会对已有行业进行重新塑造。基于DID 所建立的信用体系和声誉体系，将解决目前DeFi超额抵押导致的资金利用率低的问题。而且隐私、DAO、NFT、Gamefi 、Socalfi等赛道也必将全面爆发，这会将比特币牛市推向加密市场全面牛市。\n\n## 三、下一轮牛市全周期的预测，以及牛市对于行业内部和外部影响\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n我们利用比特币的历史价格周期规律，结合上面我们分析的原因来对下一个牛市周期做一个简单的分析预测。\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VsDd3QkOB7uv1WbxFERhD.png?height=803&width=1814)\n\n \n \n\n首先我们看比特币前两轮牛市顶点到熊市最低点回调周期和深度，统计显示：\n\n**第一轮牛市从最高点到熊市最低点，下跌了14个月，回调幅度87.06%**\n\n**第二轮牛市从最高点到熊市最低点，下跌了12个月，回调幅度84.78%**\n\n**第二次下跌周期和幅度较第一次都有缩短，那么基于此，本次回调至最低点的周期可能会小于12个月，回调幅度可能小于84.78%。**\n\n \n \n\n**结合上面标普500走势分析，我们认为比特币本轮熊市最低点可能出现在9-10月份，最低点价格可能在14000美金到15000美金区域。**\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A2gsmSB0AVgjERxcr_ZHa.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n \n \n\n前面已经分析过比特币减半是之后牛市开启的重要节点，每次减半之后都伴随着更大的牛市，在比特币熊市最低点到减半中间这段时间，我们可以认为是比特币调整时期，在这一时期比特币价格大体震荡略有上行。对于这个时间周期统计显示：\n\n \n \n\n**第一轮熊市最低点到减半，调整18个月**\n\n**第二轮熊市最低点到减半，调整16个月**\n\n \n \n\n**比特币下一次减半大约发生在2024年5月，在比特币触底到减半这段时间将是调整周期，而美国加息可能在今年底或者明年初结束，之后市场也进入恢复期。**\n\n \n \n\n**综合以上两点，我们预测这一时期，美股和比特币都将进入调整期。可以预判机构可能在此时期建仓，但是大幅震荡中散户可能失去信心而离场。**\n\n \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OksEN7E6Mpz4YLk7gdhC2.png?height=857&width=1812)\n\n \n \n\n在减半完成后比特币开始进入拉升阶段，我们可以看下比特币减半后到牛市最高点的周期和幅度的统计：\n\n \n \n\n**第一轮牛市上涨了13个月，上涨倍数是523.87**\n\n**第二轮牛市上涨了17个月，上涨倍数是129.04**\n\n**第三轮牛市上涨了19个月，上涨倍数是 22.09**\n\n \n \n\n**从上面数据看出，每轮牛市上涨周期在增加，上涨倍数由于基数变大，在不断缩小。那么我们可以推测2024年5月之后，比特币将进入拉升阶段。随后以太坊在完成升级后，基于技术提升，生态必将更加丰富，资金利用率必然提高，整个web3.0的应用层开始爆发，这时将进入加密市场全面牛市。我们预计本轮牛市比特币上涨至最高点可能需要超过19个月的时间，上涨倍数可能低于22倍，即最高价格不超过30万美金。最终比特币现货ETF也将通过，加密市场和传统金融进一步融合。**\n\n \n \n\n综合来看，我们认为**下一轮加密市场**牛市的**内在驱动力**就是狭义的**web3.0发展**，即基于区块链技术的全新互联网进行迭代发展。**它将带来的是互联网端的生产关系革新，生产关系的变革必然也会带来生产力的创新，这将是未来互联网的发展动力**。可以预见，未来必然会有更多资本进入加密行业，成熟的加密行业应用也将开始进入人们的日常生活。\n\n \n \n\n对于在本轮牛市中崛起的NFT，可能会首先进入人们的日常生活。而基于NFT发展的Gamefi 、Socalfi也会慢慢颠覆web2.0的模式。**而且狭义的web3.0只是web3.0的初期，包括区块链、元宇宙、VR/AR、人工智能的广义web3.0必然跟随发展，这将是软件和硬件设施共同带来的科技革命。做时间的朋友，耐心等待，该来的终究会来。**\n\n \n \n\n7 O'Clock

Then I’d present my progress on Friday, and so on.\n\n### Iconography\n\nAfter the flows were accepted, then we went to the icon design phase, where each of the elements should be clear, but at the same time abstract enough so that they could be easily placed in the system, reducing all the clutter the images they were using before created.\n\nThe biggest challenge here was to follow the guides and constrains from the software, so we had to come up with a system for displaying all kind of different status.\n\n![General structure for different cases for each of the elements](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gzZe_TikEnOlINgkskfGP.png?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n## Design System\n\nOnce the iconography was put in place, we developed a system for the developers to follow it, so they could then build all of the software following it.\n\n![Before & after of one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgLEkCNDeK8TnY-81sFsI.png?height=1363&width=4863&&size=medium)\n\nWe also created a UI Kit that was shared with them as a PDF. [You can check it here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12s6WQlfojBbAdWSwTUBJcampO6kTsd9j/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Final product\n\nIn the end, we created a design system for them to build their SCADA according to their needs (Alarms, different states, processes, CTAs, etc).\n\n![Final design for one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Y-KAPCB7YCJnohGr__tG.png?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\n### Made the UI cleaner and easier to read\n\nOur approach was to make the interface as clean and abstract as possible, giving more importance to actionable items than to what was working properly. This gave the operations people a clear state of their process, and told them what they had to do.\n\n### Improved the way alerts were displayed\n\nWe reduced the clutter with alerts by creating a framework for categories of them. Also, we used the red color as the alert one, generating a lot of contrast and letting the user know when something wasn’t working, right away.\n\n### Improved the flows and navigation\n\nAs part of the Information Architecture, we blended some views and separated others. We also added a proper breadcrumb with a tree view of the site, where the users is aware of where they are, all the time.\n\n### Design system in place\n\nWhen the project was done, the developers had a system that they could use to build the whole system by themselves. Until today, they haven’t asked for clarification or guidance for anything, which means the system is working properly.", "timestamp": 1658157655, "digest": "gfm1jgsazDpmk97WG_RN0Y8KH-hvUp15w-Z8ao9sGz4", "contributor": "0xaB0684A4AA2Bb286C7a6b7E7E9b5f660cb062A3d"}

个时期）。目标是在 4 年内发行 10 亿个 Evmos 代币。\n\n由于网络的长期技术上出现通货紧缩，**Evmos 被视为具有无上限供应的代币**,如果奖励被认为太低，团队鼓励社区在第 4 年之后选择替代通胀模型。例如：如果奖励被认为太低，社区可以提出线性或恒定模型。\n\n**EVMOS期望用于：**\n\n1\\.通过内置的共享费用收入模式（dApp Store）向开发人员和网络运营商支付服务费用\n\n2\\.对协议升级进行投票\n\n3\\.在 ERC20 模块上注册代币，用于 EVM-IBC 与 ERC20 的集成\n\n4\\.为 Evmos上的应用程序分配使用奖励\n\n5\\.为有用的高优先级功能启用预编译\n\n目前主要用途:质押、IBC 转账、治理存款\n\n**换算单位：**\n\n1 evmos = 1 \\* 10^{18} aevmos\n\n**创世代币分配：**\n\n初始供应：2亿\n\n战略基金：40%\n\n空投：50%\n\n社区池：10%\n\n![创世代币分配](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fRNEagudzBUrsQjcaI0Qo.png?height=398&width=700)\n\n**新发行的代币分配：**\n\n质押奖励：40%\n\n团队归属：25%\n\n使用奖励：25%\n\n社区池：10%\n\n![新发行代币分配](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1bDjwQjNh4_bR3JutSNFJ.png?height=398&width=700)\n\n![4年后代币分配](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KrngRVpJPZK-0a22wpneM.png?height=398&width=700)\n\n**战略基金：**\n\n将由基金会拥有的 multisig DAO 控制，用于通过赠款为计划提供资金，包括提供中继服务、构建浏览器、维护开源工具和部署显示网络整体市场增长的仪表板。\n\n**空投：**\n\n奖励 Cosmos 和 Ethereum 社区的活跃用户并刺激生态系统。\n\n**团队归属：**\n\n每个时期 25% 的代币将发给 Evmos 协议的开发人员。这 2 亿个 Evmo 代币面临悬崖并正在归属。在发布之前，这些将不可转让或可质押。\n\n**社区池：**\n\n社区池资金由governance控制，用于引导重要的工具、基础设施、教育内容和其他资源。社区池可用于追溯公共产品资金（链接至 Optimism）\n\n**使用奖励：**\n\n流向一个专门用于激励用户的池（gas补贴、流动性挖矿）\n\n**费用：**\n\nEvmos 的费用根据网络使用情况定价。Gas 定价基于[EIP1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md)。但我们没有烧掉基本费用，而是重新分配并投入资金。\n\n**DApp商店：**\n\n在 Evmos 中，fees不再只是燃烧或只增加网络运营商的网络所有权份额的资金。Evmos 现在通过内置的共享费用收入模型在开发人员和网络运营商之间分配费用作为他们服务的奖励。这种收入模式/费用分配称为 dApp Store。\n\n                                                                 **EVMOS链上治理**\n\n**链上治理作用：**\n\nEvmos 的链上治理机制，用于传递文本提案、更改链参数以及从社区池中支出资金。\n\n**链上治理细节：**\n\n在 Tendermint Core 共识引擎的支持下，Evmos 使用一组 150 个验证器，这些验证器运行完整节点并通过广播包含由私钥签名的加密签名的投票来参与链上治理。验证者不仅向链上提议和提交新区块，而且还通过对社区提案进行投票来参与链上资金治理。作为他们工作的回报，验证者以 Evmos 代币的形式获得收入。每个验证者的投票影响力取决于他们的代币权重（即，作为抵押品）。代币可以由验证者直接质押，也可以由 Evmos 持有者委托给他们。\n\n委托人是 Evmos 代币的持有者，他们不能或不想自己运行完整节点。这些利益相关者将他们的代币委托给验证者，并获得一部分质押收入以换取他们的委托。委托人必须进行尽职调查并对他们选择的验证人负责，因为双方不仅分享质押收入，还分享因验证人不当行为而可能发生的任何削减处罚。委托人可以选择更改他们对验证人的选择。委派给投票权百分比较低的验证者有助于确保网络的去中心化，因此委派者在整体网络健康中发挥着积极和关键的作用。\n\n根据 Cosmos SDK 的说法，如果代币委托人没有对提案进行投票，它将继承其验证人的投票。\n\n**EVMOS团队介绍**\n\n**费德里科·昆泽·库尔默：**\n\nEvmos 联合创始人兼董事也是是Sommelier的联合创始人，曾任 Interchain 软件工程师、ChainSafe Systems 和 Kava Labs 技术主管。拥有 4

TVL公链排名第68名，TVL为744万，而统计在上面的协议只有12个，大部分为DEX,而Mcap/tvl达到了57\n\n![EVMOS](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Tsfmn7brEnftsyRDSmC8k.png?height=406&width=553)\n\n![Moonbean](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V4142VflbNRdx1ymDl4Pm.png?height=424&width=553)\n\n对标波卡上兼容EVM的公链Moonbean，Moonbean在上面排名24名，TVL为1.58亿，Mcap/tvl为1.28，链上协议有26个，占比较大的协议为Moonwell、Stellaswap和Curve。相比Moonbean来说Evmos市值和质押量比值还是比较大，质押量占比最大的是Diffusion Finance，占了34.11%,TVL为253万\n\nEVMOS上线价格为3.8左右，目前EVMOS在CMC上报价为2.06 USDT，相比其它代币，EVMOS在这一波熊市下跌中表现还算是坚挺，而目前的供应量大概是3亿，但是实际流通量没有这么多，很大一部分空投未领取\n\n![供应曲线](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a_0wWOQbaOlMR83YOK2uL.png?height=434&width=554)\n\n而中心化交易所目前上了MEXC，在CEX交易占比为80.7%，DEX交易主要集中在Osmosis和Diffusion\n\n6月22号，dYdX宣布其v4版本将作为基于Cosmos SDK和Tendermint共识的独立区块链推出，相信对于整个COSMOS生态来说都是利好的，而对于兼容EVM的EVMOS来说，在其高吞吐量、快速交易、低手续费及生态补贴的特性下，相信未来会有更多的协议选择部署在EVMOS或者去兼容EVMOS,让我们拭目以待吧\n\n**最后**\n\n截止到2022年7月18号，在EVMOS上空投代币只索赔了2469万，还有近7500万的空投代币未领取，到8月2号未领取的代币数量将开始进行衰减，直到10月1号将全部流入社区池。未领取的要尽快去领取\n\n![空投页面](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YaAbtYubDldbN3unBNBiV.png?height=393&width=553)\n\n领取代币后也可以选择质押节点，目前的质押收益还不错，而且COSMOS生态项目的惯例是针对生态的参与用户进行空投，例如：质押、添加LP等。有一点值得注意的是，质押EVMOS解锁需要14天的一个锁定期\n\n**相关链接：**\n\nEVMOS官网：<https://evmos.org/>\n\nEVMOS文档：<https://docs.evmos.org/>\n\nEVMOS推特：<https://twitter.com/EvmosOrg>\n\nEVMOS电报：<https://t.me/EvmosOrg> (英文）\n\nEVMOS电报：<https://t.me/evmos_zh> (中文）\n\nEVMOS

个时期）。目标是在 4 年内发行 10 亿个 Evmos 代币。\n\n由于网络的长期技术上出现通货紧缩，**Evmos 被视为具有无上限供应的代币**,如果奖励被认为太低，团队鼓励社区在第 4 年之后选择替代通胀模型。例如：如果奖励被认为太低，社区可以提出线性或恒定模型。\n\n**EVMOS期望用于：**\n\n1\\.通过内置的共享费用收入模式（dApp Store）向开发人员和网络运营商支付服务费用\n\n2\\.对协议升级进行投票\n\n3\\.在 ERC20 模块上注册代币，用于 EVM-IBC 与 ERC20 的集成\n\n4\\.为 Evmos上的应用程序分配使用奖励\n\n5\\.为有用的高优先级功能启用预编译\n\n目前主要用途:质押、IBC 转账、治理存款\n\n**换算单位：**\n\n1 evmos = 1 \\* 10^{18} aevmos\n\n**创世代币分配：**\n\n初始供应：2亿\n\n战略基金：40%\n\n空投：50%\n\n社区池：10%\n\n![创世代币分配](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fRNEagudzBUrsQjcaI0Qo.png?height=398&width=700)\n\n**新发行的代币分配：**\n\n质押奖励：40%\n\n团队归属：25%\n\n使用奖励：25%\n\n社区池：10%\n\n![4年后代币分配](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KrngRVpJPZK-0a22wpneM.png?height=398&width=700)\n\n**战略基金：**\n\n将由基金会拥有的 multisig DAO 控制，用于通过赠款为计划提供资金，包括提供中继服务、构建浏览器、维护开源工具和部署显示网络整体市场增长的仪表板。\n\n**空投：**\n\n奖励 Cosmos 和 Ethereum 社区的活跃用户并刺激生态系统。\n\n**团队归属：**\n\n每个时期 25% 的代币将发给 Evmos 协议的开发人员。这 2 亿个 Evmo 代币面临悬崖并正在归属。在发布之前，这些将不可转让或可质押。\n\n**社区池：**\n\n社区池资金由governance控制，用于引导重要的工具、基础设施、教育内容和其他资源。社区池可用于追溯公共产品资金（链接至 Optimism）\n\n**使用奖励：**\n\n流向一个专门用于激励用户的池（gas补贴、流动性挖矿）\n\n**费用：**\n\nEvmos 的费用根据网络使用情况定价。Gas 定价基于[EIP1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md)。但我们没有烧掉基本费用，而是重新分配并投入资金。\n\n**DApp商店：**\n\n在 Evmos 中，fees不再只是燃烧或只增加网络运营商的网络所有权份额的资金。Evmos 现在通过内置的共享费用收入模型在开发人员和网络运营商之间分配费用作为他们服务的奖励。这种收入模式/费用分配称为 dApp Store。\n\n                                                                 **EVMOS链上治理**\n\n**链上治理作用：**\n\nEvmos 的链上治理机制，用于传递文本提案、更改链参数以及从社区池中支出资金。\n\n**链上治理细节：**\n\n在 Tendermint Core 共识引擎的支持下，Evmos 使用一组 150 个验证器，这些验证器运行完整节点并通过广播包含由私钥签名的加密签名的投票来参与链上治理。验证者不仅向链上提议和提交新区块，而且还通过对社区提案进行投票来参与链上资金治理。作为他们工作的回报，验证者以 Evmos 代币的形式获得收入。每个验证者的投票影响力取决于他们的代币权重（即，作为抵押品）。代币可以由验证者直接质押，也可以由 Evmos 持有者委托给他们。\n\n委托人是 Evmos 代币的持有者，他们不能或不想自己运行完整节点。这些利益相关者将他们的代币委托给验证者，并获得一部分质押收入以换取他们的委托。委托人必须进行尽职调查并对他们选择的验证人负责，因为双方不仅分享质押收入，还分享因验证人不当行为而可能发生的任何削减处罚。委托人可以选择更改他们对验证人的选择。委派给投票权百分比较低的验证者有助于确保网络的去中心化，因此委派者在整体网络健康中发挥着积极和关键的作用。\n\n根据 Cosmos SDK 的说法，如果代币委托人没有对提案进行投票，它将继承其验证人的投票。\n\n**EVMOS团队介绍**\n\n**费德里科·昆泽·库尔默：**\n\nEvmos 联合创始人兼董事也是是Sommelier的联合创始人，曾任 Interchain 软件工程师、ChainSafe Systems 和 Kava Labs 技术主管。拥有 4

一种开源和非托管流动性协议，用于赚取存款和借贷资产的利息。Evmos 还将使跨链应用程序能够利用 AAVE 的流动性，同时部署到 Terra 等其他 Cosmos 链。**（以太坊上借贷协议，已发币）**\n\n**Saddle Finance**---是 Evmos 区块链上的去中心化自动化做市商，针对锚定价值加密资产（如稳定币和打包 BTC）进行了优化。**（以太坊上AMM，已发币）**\n\n**Diffusion Finance**---是 Uniswap v2 的一个分支。它将成为 Evmos 的首批 AMM 之一，这是 Cosmos 上的 EVM，它利用 Cosmos SDK 实现围绕可组合性、互操作性和快速终结性的用例。**（EVMOS上TVL最大DEX，已公布代币空投规则）**\n\n**Coslend**---是 Evmos 生态系统中第一个基于 Compound 的货币市场，Compound 是最大的 DeFi 协议之一。我们的目标是创建一个安全、开放、透明的去中心化金融货币市场。**（未发币，部分已快照，空投详情：<https://docs.coslend.com/airdrops>）**\n\n**Cronus Finance**---Cronus Finance 是基于 Evmos 构建的完全无需许可且可组合的 AMM。**（已发币）**\n\n**FRAX**---为用户提供了对 DeFi 生态系统的更大可访问性，因为稳定币与法定货币挂钩，但本身作为加密货币存在，允许与去中心化协议轻松交互。**（算法稳定币）**\n\n**EvmoSwap** ---是 Evmos 链上的去中心化交易所（DEX）。**（代币已IEO，测试网有空投，**可检查：**https://app.evmoswap.org/airdrops）**\n\n**42T Finance** --- 股权流动性。赚取增强奖励。**（目前还无官网）**\n\n**Evmos Domains** --- Evmos Domains 是一种分散式名称服务，用于将 .evmos 名称链接到地址等数据。**（可注册域名体验）**\n\n### NFT:\n\n**Orbit Market** ---EvmosOrg 上的第一个 NFT 市场。\n\n**Tofu NFT**---是最大的 GameFi、DeFi 和收藏品多链 NFT 市场。\n\n**Treasureland** --- 是一个跨链 NFT 平台，用于 NFT 发行、NFT 交易、NFT 收藏和量身定制的店内服务。\n\n### Launchpad:\n\n**DEXPAD**---去中心化 Launchpad 协议。\n\n**Tool:**\n\n**Band Protocol**---安全、可扩展的跨链去中心化预言机，将智能合约连接到外部数据和 API。\n\n**Evmos.Space** ---跟踪 Evmos 上所有最新项目的项目发现门户。\n\n**EVMOS的现状**\n\n目前Evmos在Defi Llama TVL公链排名第68名，TVL为744万，而统计在上面的协议只有12个，大部分为DEX,而Mcap/tvl达到了57\n\n![EVMOS](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Tsfmn7brEnftsyRDSmC8k.png?height=406&width=553)\n\n![Moonbean](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/V4142VflbNRdx1ymDl4Pm.png?height=424&width=553)\n\n对标波卡上兼容EVM的公链Moonbean，Moonbean在上面排名24名，TVL为1.58亿，Mcap/tvl为1.28，链上协议有26个，占比较大的协议为Moonwell、Stellaswap和Curve。相比Moonbean来说Evmos市值和质押量比值还是比较大，质押量占比最大的是Diffusion Finance，占了34.11%,TVL为253万\n\nEVMOS上线价格为3.8左右，目前EVMOS在CMC上报价为2.06 USDT，相比其它代币，EVMOS在这一波熊市下跌中表现还算是坚挺，而目前的供应量大概是3亿，但是实际流通量没有这么多，很大一部分空投未领取\n\n![供应曲线](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a_0wWOQbaOlMR83YOK2uL.png?height=434&width=554)\n\n而中心化交易所目前上了MEXC，在CEX交易占比为80.7%，DEX交易主要集中在Osmosis和Diffusion\n\n6月22号，dYdX宣布其v4版本将作为基于Cosmos SDK和Tendermint共识的独立区块链推出，相信对于整个COSMOS生态来说都是利好的，而对于兼容EVM的EVMOS来说，在其高吞吐量、快速交易、低手续费及生态补贴的特性下，相信未来会有更多的协议选择部署在EVMOS或者去兼容EVMOS,让我们拭目以待吧\n\n**最后**\n\n截止到2022年7月18号，在EVMOS上空投代币只索赔了2469万，还有近7500万的空投代币未领取，到8月2号未领取的代币数量将开始进行衰减，直到10月1号将全部流入社区池。未领取的要尽快去领取\n\n![空投页面](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YaAbtYubDldbN3unBNBiV.png?height=393&width=553)\n\n领取代币后也可以选择质押节点，目前的质押收益还不错，而且COSMOS生态项目的惯例是针对生态的参与用户进行空投，例如：质押、添加LP等。有一点值得注意的是，质押EVMOS解锁需要14天的一个锁定期\n\n**相关链接：**\n\nEVMOS官网：<https://evmos.org/>\n\nEVMOS文档：<https://docs.evmos.org/>\n\nEVMOS推特：<https://twitter.com/EvmosOrg>\n\nEVMOS电报：<https://t.me/EvmosOrg> (英文）\n\nEVMOS电报：<https://t.me/evmos_zh> (中文）\n\nEVMOS

The second one was to improve the experience for the plant’s controllers, which is what this case is about.\n\n\\**This particular software is only available for Desktop, and they have a fixed resolution for their screens, which made responsive irrelevant for this project.*\n\n## Discovery\n\nWhen this project started, we had already covered some ground as part of the discovery phase. Nevertheless, we were still missing to talk to the heavy users of the software: the operations team.\n\nWe had a different sessions where we went through the flows and actions of each of the different operation profiles. When we were done, we came up with rules and constrains we’d need to follow and also identified some data that wasn’t necessary and we could get rid of.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. **Make the UI cleaner and easier to read.** Almost everybody agreed that the UI was very heavy to the eyes.\n2. **Improve the way alerts were displayed.** With some many graphical elements alerts were constantly missed or ignored.\n3. **Improve the flows and navigation.** They had inconsistent navigation patterns which result in users getting lost in the interface.\n\n## Hands on\n\n### Navigation\n\nThe first thing we did was to map the software structure, so we could define a proper navigation pattern. In the end, we went for a tree structure with a Breadcrumb, that would always let the user know where they were.\n\n### Colors\n\nAs we had already defined a color palette for the Dashboard project, we just inherited it and keep working with it.\n\n### Flows\n\nIn order to understand better the flows they had, we went for a full deconstruction of the screens and try and understand what they wanted to show.\n\n![Wireframe of one of the screens (One of the first iterations)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bomViWzwUF2erCSfmjsfr.png?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=medium)\n\nWe set a weekly iterative process, where I showed my progress on Friday, we went over it, discussed it and got some initial feedback, and then they sent all the final feedback on Tuesday. Then I’d present my progress on Friday, and so on.\n\n### Iconography\n\nAfter the flows were accepted, then we went to the icon design phase, where each of the elements should be clear, but at the same time abstract enough so that they could be easily placed in the system, reducing all the clutter the images they were using before created.\n\nThe biggest challenge here was to follow the guides and constrains from the software, so we had to come up with a system for displaying all kind of different status.\n\n![General structure for different cases for each of the elements](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gzZe_TikEnOlINgkskfGP.png?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=medium)\n\n## Design System\n\nOnce the iconography was put in place, we developed a system for the developers to follow it, so they could then build all of the software following it.\n\n![Before & after of one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgLEkCNDeK8TnY-81sFsI.png?height=1363&width=4863&&&size=medium)\n\nWe also created a UI Kit that was shared with them as a PDF. [You can check it here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12s6WQlfojBbAdWSwTUBJcampO6kTsd9j/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Final product\n\nIn the end, we created a design system for them to build their SCADA according to their needs (Alarms, different states, processes, CTAs, etc).\n\n![Final design for one of the views](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9Y-KAPCB7YCJnohGr__tG.png?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=medium)\n\n### Made the UI cleaner and easier to read\n\nOur approach was to make the interface as clean and abstract as possible, giving more importance to actionable items than to what was working properly. This gave the operations people a clear state of their process, and told them what they had to do.\n\n### Improved the way alerts were displayed\n\nWe reduced the clutter with alerts by creating a framework for categories of them. Also, we used the red color as the alert one, generating a lot of contrast and letting the user know when something wasn’t working, right away.\n\n### Improved the flows and navigation\n\nAs part of the Information Architecture, we blended some views and separated others. We also added a proper breadcrumb with a tree view of the site, where the users is aware of where they are, all the time.\n\n### Design system in place\n\nWhen the project was done, the developers had a system that they could use to build the whole system by themselves. Until today, they haven’t asked for clarification or guidance for anything, which means the system is working properly.", "timestamp": 1658157886, "digest": "rs_6EBis05shTcwkFD5nPgnSVVkRmLhvTT8vn8_A5y8", "contributor": "0xaB0684A4AA2Bb286C7a6b7E7E9b5f660cb062A3d"}

They’re the ones in charge of providing Bilbao with clean water, as well as purifying the wastewater created.\n\nAs a product designer for DigitaLinkers, my task was to re-design their SCADA system (A SCADA is a central controller for industrial machinery).\n\n![Homepage before the project started](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QPKgmNucsRGYbh0rVoVbi.png?height=742&width=1440&size=medium)\n\n\\**This particular software is only available for Desktop, and they have a fixed resolution for their screens, which made responsive irrelevant for this project.*\n\n## Discovery\n\nIn the discovery phase of the process, we identified 2 main users who would interact with the system on a constant basis: Management and operations. We run a Design thinking workshop where we went deep in this topic and identified areas to work on, as well as defined both users’ interests.\n\n![Pictures from the design thinking workshop](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4g1cL0TbsrdX8nfMA84z5.png?height=708&width=1160&size=medium)\n\n## Users\n\n### Management\n\nInterested in the overall functioning of the plant. They want to know everything is working fine, and if there’s something they should be aware of.\n\n### Operations\n\nInterested in their area. If there’s an issue and they’re responsible for it, they have to be aware of what’s going on, and take actions on it.\n\n## Areas to work on\n\n### Usability\n\nOne of the biggest pain points they had is that the initial page was unable to understand if you had no experience with it. The main driver for this project was to have a system that was more usable by all of the profiles involved.\n\n### Accessibility\n\nThe SCADA is used 24/7 in different kind of screens (from 23” to 60” screens) and in different environments, so sometimes it was very tiring to look at.\n\n## Constrains\n\nAs this is a 3rd party software where integrators were doing their magic on top of it, it came with a couple limitations and design constrains that we had to work with.\n\n1. There were limitations in terms of charts and information we could display\n2. There was a pre-defined way of showing errors that would be followed\n\nAs this was my first (and only so far) SCADA project, we had a very close relationship with the developers, where I needed their guidance on the Do’s and Don’ts for the project.\n\n## Hands on\n\n### UI\n\nOne of the first decisions we made was to reduce all the color weight the interface had to make it more readable. Also, we went through a process where we defined the data and tried to put it all together in one screen.\n\n### Data definition\n\nDuring the workshop we created a doc where we wrote down the data each of the profiles needed to be displayed in the initial dashboard.\n\nAfterwards, we went through a definition process to discover which data was really important, what we could get rid of, and what was missing.\n\nThis was a weekly iterative process, where I showed my progress on Friday, we went over it, discussed it and got some initial feedback, and then they sent all the final feedback on Tuesday. Then I’d present my progress on Friday, and so on.\n\n![Data definition iterations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nb-D4rMrZWSCszOutBkjY.png?height=700&width=3096&size=medium)\n\n### Data visualization\n\nOnce data was somewhat defined (there were still some unknowns, but we were confident we could finish this as the process advanced), we moved on to a DataViz phase. We used the same iteration model, where we were validating weekly our decisions.\n\n![DataViz iterations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wxNftUn_Kml_XQDukWIwL.png?height=1080&width=5792&size=medium)\n\n## Final result\n\n![Final Dashboard design](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HS1m3rKKN4ysvLULtPDhc.png?height=1080&width=1920&size=medium)\n\nIn the end, the client was happy with it, and the initial feedback I got from it was very positive, so you could say the final result was a good one.\n\nSadly, when you work for an agency most of the times you don’t follow the project after you deliver it, so I don’t have actual data to see how the system is performing and what should be improved - there’s always something to be improved.\n\n![Before & after](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NB9vjL_GzuZdDL2sX9ZBL.png?height=742&width=2776&size=medium)\n\nNevertheless, from the agency they still say the client is satisfied, so I take that as a win 🙂", "timestamp": 1658158343, "digest": "cu7xHwMS-2Cjj5clO1uVwkxV5_MPrYEePYeq6YQ0ffI", "contributor": "0xaB0684A4AA2Bb286C7a6b7E7E9b5f660cb062A3d"}

Maybe it’s not people/ pets though. Maybe it’s freedom, independence, or worldly experiences. Maybe it’s your health and wellness. Maybe it’s Power, Fame, Success. My point being, we place value on a number of different things in our life today.\n\nWhat does the “world” value today?\n\nA hybrid of the things above potentially, but also the value of the USD.\n\nThere is a colloquial saying, “Cash is King,” meaning cash is more valuable than any other form of investment tools. Whether you agree with this sentiment or not, how did “cash” become so valuable?\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-is-king.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-is-king.asp)\n\nWell I’ll give you a pencil and napkin summary here.\n\nFirst it started during the Hunter Age, when people traded crops and cattle. Then, people started going to war and wealth got a bad rep. The Warrior Age created value for the king and if you survived, receiving land was most valuable. People then began forming modern day cities. Useful and decorative crafts became valuable. As cities started to change the landscape, the idea to explore far away lands became a thing so exotic goods became valuable. Craftsmen kept perfecting their skills at home and afar and the introduction of machinery allowed for things to be mass produced so value was created significantly faster. Around this same time, transportation and the demand for fuel was growing. Insert Rockefeller’s and Getty’s of the world. Now fast forward to the Corporate Age, with transportation demands solved, distributions of factory goods was possible to/from anywhere. Corporations formed from factories with growing departments. With the corporations growing, Banks realized they could buy corporations and resell them. Insert the evolution Fed and corporations now creating value in the order of billions of USD. With corporations employing hundreds of people, people spending money, and banks managing transactions… a significant amount of data was accumulating. Hence the rapid development of technology to manage and organize this data. As technology has evolved, the importance of the security and integrity of this data has caused us to re-evaluate how this data is managed through the evolution of blockchain technology. Now we see are starting to see what we value physically, digitally. \n\n[https://blog.adioma.com/the-history-of-creating-value-infographic/](https://blog.adioma.com/the-history-of-creating-value-infographic/)\n\nThe value of the Euro is predicted to reach $.97 USD by September WSJ reported this morning. Tiktok influencers are flocking to Europe to grab hold of their Gucci, Prada, Coco and Chanel bags for almost half the price they are in the states. Meanwhile I’m back here wondering if I should get a pet chicken with the cost of eggs rising. All comments aside though, I do wonder how the changing value of the US dollar will impact our future and particularly cryptocurrency?\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/strong-dollar-extends-gains-with-no-end-to-rally-in-sight-11658066581](https://www.wsj.com/articles/strong-dollar-extends-gains-with-no-end-to-rally-in-sight-11658066581)\n\n(Additionally, WSJ reported the WSJ Dollar Index, the index that measures the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, hit a 20 year high last week and is nearly up 2.5% this month. They also reported the Fed was likely to raise rates by another .75 percentage points this month and are doing what they can to stop rising consumer prices.)\n\nOn the future value of currency and its impact on cryptocurrency… some economic theories at play as depicted in Bankless’ interview with Lyn Alden.\n\n[http://podcast.banklesshq.com/127-is-this-the-end-lyn-alden](http://podcast.banklesshq.com/127-is-this-the-end-lyn-alden)\n\n1\\. Long Term Debt Cycles: These macroeconomic trends resurface every several decades and each cycle is slightly different but the climax is consistently triggered by massive debt, threadbare interest rates, and currency devaluation. These factors combine to destabilize global systems, meaning ends of eras on a global scale: failing empires, wars, currency rebases, major demographic shifts. Decelerating growth, runway inflation, deep downtrends… when they hit the employment market…. its already a recession. Dalio predicts our next recession to be a catalyst for a transition from US-based dominance of the global economy to a multi polar world. Russia, China, India… they’ve already begun detaching from the dollar dominance in the midst of their own financial crises.\n\n2\\. Opposing Milkshake Theory: The idea that the global financial upheaval upon which we seem to be flirting will actually be good news for dollar strength as the American economy will ultimately drink everyone else’s milkshake and re-assert global dominance. Many think this is only true until its not and some predict that short term dollar strength may actually be an indicator of long-term dollar decline. This is because the US Dollar is a global reserve currency. It’s the currency that most offshore debt is denominated in all over the world and $13 trillion in US denominated debt exist globally and over 50 trillion in US financial assets. With disruption in global cash flows, there is a short squeeze of the dollar and so it spikes upwards. Not really a strength but rather an unfolding weakness of other currencies. Ultimately this leads to an acceleration of the mega-macro move to multi-polarity which diminishes the global reliance on US economy and its dollar. Many signs pointing to this being only months away.\n\n3\\. The Fed: Move Slow and Break Stuff: The Fed has been slow to respond to inflation, so now its stuck to move overly aggressively to catch up as economic activity is decelerating. Until the Fed breaks treasuries and credit markets, they will continue to raise rates. It is unlikely they can continue to raise rates until 2023, but they will not stop until it breaks the system. TBD.\n\nHow does this impact the crypto market: Interest rate hikes will likely be bad for the crypto market in the short term and right now digital assets are getting hit hard until this all plays out. The Merge is a secret weapon for Ethereum, but crypto as an asset is not really driving the macro environment. The Fed really has much bigger fish to fry right now. Of note the CeFi contagion took out scores of notable crypto banks to the tune of hundred of billions of dollars in just a number of weeks. Crypto is just a precursor to what we’ll see in its legacy equivalent. Infrastructure of crypto, web3, and DeFi have survived one deleveraging stress test but we shall see if they can continue with flying colors.\n\nAxios Crypto reported that Stablecoins are the current focus of regulatory efforts. Bitcoin, which started as a peer-to-peer cash system has worked thus far because retail can't know what it will be worth from day to day. So far stablecoins haven’t disrupted shit. (currently 154B) Without regulation, a stablecoin that enters the mainstream of the financial system and is widely used as a means of payments and/or store of value in multiple jurisdictions could pose significant risks to financial stability. Hence, why no stablecoins are even close to mainstream. However, credit card companies are getting ready now for the possibility as reflected in a recent WSJ article. However, the article fails to mention exactly how credit card companies are implementing crypto and also companies that are facilitating crypto for card payments already.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-is-coming-to-your-credit-cards-11657374215](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-is-coming-to-your-credit-cards-11657374215)\n\nCelsius, a blockchain technology that allowed its customers to earn interest on their cryptocurrency deposits, officially declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. They will remain in business, but now take time to pay off their debts. How they are branding it… “opportunity to stabilize their business and consummate a comprehensive restructuring transaction that maximize value for stakeholders.”\n\nBad news: There is no clear timeline for when its 300K active users with >$100USD in balances will be able to make withdrawals.\n\nI would expect some layoffs @ Celsius and on top of that Celsius faces a lawsuit against its former investment manager accusing them of being a “Ponzi Scheme.”\n\nA calendar hold for… September 19th. The new anticipated date of the the Merge, which I discussed in previous writings and referred to above.\n\n[https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-dev-confirms-perpetual-date-for-pos-merge](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-dev-confirms-perpetual-date-for-pos-merge)\n\nTo bring this all together… last week I took the Enneagram test, which is a personality trait test that is categorized into nine different types. My dominate type was the “Enthusiast” or Type 7. Based on this type, I spend a significant amount of time and am strongly influenced in my behaviors and decision-making by what is called the “Head Center” of Intelligence. In short, I think a lot about the question, “How do I navigate the future?” This fear based type pays a lot of attention to what’s going to happen in the future and who/what I can trust to provide guidance through it. This type often struggles with anxiety- trying to outsmart it, outrun it, or allowing it to determine my decisions. \n\nWhat we value… past, present, and future, is consistently evolving. While it is important to being thinking about these things… the future, the state of currency, what is valuable… we can’t forget to take a step back and just be present. \n\nWill leave you with an interesting find in the NFT space below. \n\nUtility… overused terms these days in my mind. But nonetheless there are a number of use cases being deployed right within the NFT space and sharing an interesting one.\n\nRevulution NFTs\n\nWhat are they? They are actual certificates of subscription ownership in the form of NFTs. You can now transfer your subscriptions to another person. You can send them as a gift or resell it on the market. If, for some reason you don’t want to use the subscription for a certain period of time, you can rent the NFT and earn a passive income or use it as a collateral for a loan with the launch of protocols on the Cardano network.\n\nHeres the breakdown? You buy the Netflix for life NFT, you pay $349 USD. Then you decide to use it over the next 5 years. The cost of Netflix is $10/month, $120/year, over the course of those five years you save $600 bucks and your Netflix NFT will not use value if you use the subscription.\n\nWhere’s the catch? Only UK and EU citizen can use them (excluding Malta, Germany, and Austria). Subscriptions include Netflix + Spotify\n\nTill next time… keep on keepin it real.

When you design systems that try to anticipate how complex organizations will act, you make a set of assumptions. Some of those assumptions will be correct, and some will be wrong.\n\nUltimately, it’s the **constant testing of those assumptions that allow systems to evolve into sophisticated, well-oiled machines.**\n\nAnd so, when you prematurely optimize DAOs, you end up with a system that’s often anticipating the wrong problems and thus creating complicated solutions to address problems the DAO does not yet have. This anticipation and problem-solving introduces new sets of assumptions into a system.\n\nWhen you introduce more assumptions, it becomes increasingly difficult to pinpoint why a system is failing – is it because of assumption A or assumption B? The more assumptions you have, the harder it is to figure out which assumptions are wrong and which are right.\n\nSo why do we prematurely optimize?\n\nFear of failure. We think if we anticipate problems now, we can design our way out of those challenges.\n\nBut often the opposite is true. In fact, it is this fear of failure that costs time and money in the long-run, as we lose the data and learnings that come from constantly testing assumptions (learning which assumptions are wrong and which are right).\n\n# The Evolutionary Organization\n\nThe key to building complex systems is not designing complexity from the start. Instead, it’s about building simple systems, allowing them to fail, and iterating on those systems based on what works and what does not work.\n\nThis is [Gall’s Law](http://principles-wiki.net/principles:gall_s_law) in action.\n\nOne important note: in these systems, failure isn’t just inevitable – it’s actually helpful. By constantly testing assumptions and maximizing learning, **these systems become evolutionary organizations.**\n\n# Flexibility\n\nBut evolutionary organizations don’t just optimize for learning – they also optimize for flexibility. Flexible systems allow organizations to leverage learnings and make incremental improvements (constantly testing assumptions!).\n\nWhen it comes to DAOs (and anything on-chain for that matter), flexibility is rarely designed into systems.\n\nBut it really should be.\n\nModularity is the name of the game in this regard. Unlike monolithic DAO implementations, modular DAO implementations allow for quick testing and iterations, which ultimately allow organizations to evolve quickly and efficiently.\n\nOften when we think about flexibility in systems design, it comes with trade-offs – typically around things like security. But flexibility doesn’t necessarily require sacrificing security. Using tools like [pods](https://www.orcaprotocol.org/), DAOs can build modular systems, which maintain security at the local pod level, while enabling flexibility at the DAO level.\n\n# Becoming Evolutionary\n\nSo you want to build an evolutionary organization, anon?\n\n**Start simple.** Stop trying to design the most sophisticated governance system. Start with something simple and evolve from there.\n\n**Fail intentionally.** Make assumptions. Test those assumptions. Repeat.\n\n**Build modular.** Think about your organization as a car. You can swap out parts and it’ll still run just fine.\n\n<br><br><br>\n\nPod-pilled? Ready to go modular? Well you’re in luck – we’ve got some big announcements coming up.

Hence, they needed a way to create a task for their team.\n\n## Discovery\n\nAs part of the discovery process we had client interviews and input from the Customer Success team. Based on it, we created a list of requirements we needed to fulfill when creating a task:\n\n1. A title for the task\n2. A description for the task\n3. Any attachments that were relevant for the assignee to complete the task\n4. There were 2 modes\n   1. Simple task\n   2. Task with To-dos\n5. Had to be scheduled for a specific day\n   1. Could have a specific completion time\n   2. Could be a one time task\n   3. Could be a repetitive task\n      1. Repetitive tasks had a set of different variations\n6. Had to be assigned to different people\n   1. Could be assigned to individuals\n   2. Could be assigned to the whole store\n\n![Initial design for the task creation flow](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_6YXJqNlndKYV5hvyBJro.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n## Decisions\n\nAs it was a lot of information, we decided to break the creation into a step by step flow that reduced the cognitive noise and help them focus on the task at hand. It ended up being divided into a 4 section flow.\n\n![Step by step process for the task creation flow](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LrZhTccgYeAMLUunI7bDw.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n### Details\n\nThe details section grouped everything that was related with the information the Assignee needed to know in order to be able to complete the task:\n\n* Title\n* Description\n* Attachments\n\n![Task details](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o0u6bmedomK1yPmTw0fVr.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n### To dos\n\nDuring the validation process we realised there were 2 main type of tasks: The ones that were a simple confirmation task (I’ve made it), while other required more actions. The actions that we identified during our research were:\n\n* Checklist (sub-tasks)\n* Take a picture\n* Attach a file\n* Write something\n* Multiple choice\n* Rating\n\nBased on this, the second part of the flow was focused on helping the user choose what type of task to create.\n\n![Different options to select the type of to-do to add to the task (or not)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uA6K8KC82sN8ojkLVF1mS.png?height=900&width=1620)\n\n### Schedule\n\nAlso as part of our research and the data we had from the platform, we realised users created more repeating tasks than one time ones. That’s why we made this the default option. Also, we added the “Advanced settings” feature, which gave the users the flexibility to schedule their tasks with very complex settings while keeping it simple at first sight.\n\n![Different options for scheduling a task](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y8b40fy7ArOeGE_pQDxG4.png?height=900&width=1600)\n\n### Assign\n\nThe last step of the flow was who to assign the task to. Users had the option to assign the task to a whole location where just 1 person from that location could complete it (Close the store, for example) and it’d be completed for everyone who belong to that store, or to a specific individual.

{"id": "rGSheRvt8xDZSoEzUAxQ5vaFQskioR-uB6UdYcLyj7s", "title": "The Token Compensation Paradox: Losing Reputation To Earn Money.", "body": "***This piece was written in collaboration with [Eliot Couvat](https://twitter.com/CDTEliot) to expand upon the thoughts we shared on “[De-Financializing Social Tokens](https://kairon.mirror.xyz/O_yvXUWh73LtfEJ3AdUQtZEPFK8dPp5Zmynf9qx-uYc)”, we figured now more than ever would be the best time to get this conversation started in tokenized communities and DAOs. If you’d like to check out Eliot’s amazing writing on Social Tokens [make sure to follow him on Substack!](https://eliotc.substack.com/)***\n\n\n---\n\nMany people took the leap into Web3 and started contributing to DAOs because of the excitement of being paid in tokens.\n\nThat’s because, unlike traditional salaries, tokens offered them almost unlimited upside (similar to equities), and contributors could earn a lot without bringing upfront capital.\n\nBut, continuing their journey and becoming increasingly involved in several projects, more contributors realized their tokens also provided them ownership, a voice over future strategic decisions, and unlocked new perks in specific communities.\n\nAnd, after some time, many contributors found themselves stuck with their tokens, wanting to take profit, and make a living salary, but not at the expense of their voice and their reputation.\n\n[https://twitter.com/samspurlin/status/1525613447240634371](https://twitter.com/samspurlin/status/1525613447240634371)\n\nSo how do we solve this Token Compensation Paradox that’s blocking DAOs and contributors from scaling and moving towards new horizons? Well, if we want to address the problem in-depth and re-think an entire compensation model used by thousands of DAOs, first we need to understand the underlying issues that come with the current situation.\n\n## 1 - Beyond The Reputation Problem\n\nThe contributor compensation problem goes well beyond the simple struggle of sacrificing your reputation to make a livable salary.\n\nWith the compensation model we've built, we're heading toward wider inequalities within DAOs, more social pressure for contributors, and an ever increasing amount of DAOs failing due to this unsustainable model.\n\nIndeed, if we want to pride ourselves in building new organizations, reinventing governance and political models; it's essential to separate voice from pay - otherwise, we're just building pure oligarchies and exacerbating inequality.\n\nTo illustrate how this model could eventually backfire on DAOs, here’s a real world example of what happens when you tie a person’s bags with their political power: Sweden used a financially weighted voting system until 1910, the number of votes that one could have was proportional to their wealth. This resulted in a couple of individuals having more than half the votes in several dozen municipalities - almost like perfectly legal dictators.\n\n[https://twitter.com/fkpxls/status/1531306137856909312](https://twitter.com/fkpxls/status/1531306137856909312)\n\nFor DAOs to [compete with traditional companies](https://eliotc.substack.com/p/working-for-a-dao-how-thousands-of), we should do away with the social pressure that comes with selling tokens. No contributor should have to \"short\" the DAO and go against their beliefs to pay the bills; nor should they harm or quit a community they believe in, simply because they can't afford to keep their tokens. And the problem goes even further; because the incentives are not aligned, the current compensation scenario can even make the most active contributors hurt the community, their regular sales negatively impacting the token's price and harming the decentralization potential of decision making. All of this, mind you, within the confines of the community they value most.\n\nYour most fervent believers shouldn’t be getting paid exclusively in the same type of virtual currency they use on a day to day basis to make decisions, grow their reputation, and push the DAO forward. By tying their payout to your DAO’s native token, you’re sacrificing the diversity of opinions you aim to nurture, and harming your project as a whole.\n\nIf we want to create new compensation models, we must rethink them from the ground up and align incentives between the DAO growth and contributors.\n\nSo how do we do that?\n\n## 2 - Betting On The Long Term\n\nQuite a few obvious ideas come to mind, and some have even been tested out. A handful of people argue that DAOs should pay salaries with Social tokens and use NFTs for reputation. Others have suggested paying contributors only in USDC, or creating two tokens, one for governance and the other as a source of liquidity.\n\nWhile all those solutions seem promising, implementing or defining any of them as the de facto compensation model for DAOs would be missing the big picture.\n\nSocial tokens are much more liquid than NFTs, and allow communities to reward their contributors in a much more streamlined manner. They work particularly well as a reputation system and engage contributors towards exploring everything your community has to offer. Using them simply as a way to compensate contributors would simply kill their utility and their reason to exist. There's no such thing as an NFT that generates continuous engagement and rewards your daily contributors' loyalty.\n\nAs the Music NFT's artist [Xcelencia](https://twitter.com/Xcelencia) mentioned [in an interview](https://learn.trybonfire.xyz/case-studies-interviews/interview-with-xcelencia-equis-1) talking about the way he manages his community:\n\n> *\"I see social tokens as this continuous engagement. I treat it as a sort of loyalty or rewards program where I can keep everyone in and have them contribute in new and different ways.*\n>\n> *Whereas I see NFTs as these 'big moments' or highlights, the things you really want to commemorate like a great song, you want to put it out as an NFT. It's a different type of engagement.\"*\n\n**Dissociating social tokens from reputation would kill your contributors' engagement, and so would paying them only in USDC.**\n\nPaying contributors in USDC would mean firstly not sharing ownership (a core principle of DAOs), and secondly, forgetting that most DAOs usually don't have a financially liquid treasury beyond their tokens. Tokens are a great way to share \"future\" upside and recognize the effort of early contributors.\n\nPaying contributors in USDC and providing governance tokens to decentralized decisions would surely solve the problem in the short term, but it would also end up nurturing a community without any values beyond the next paycheck.\n\n**Something very similar would happen if you choose to create two tokens - one for salary and one for governance.**\n\nWhile some may believe this solves the liquidity problem while retaining the \"real\" token's intrinsic value, what you're really doing is cutting your community's potential in half by distracting your message and limiting the true capabilities of tokenization.\n\nBesides, the value offered by governance, access, and reputation can be incentive enough in some cases, just not in an everyday scenario for your average contributor. It's not unheard of to see social tokens being sold in \"black markets\" of sorts for non-negligible prices based on the value they offer alone. So, in the end, the 2nd token would need liquidity anyway, and the problem would still be the same.\n\nAll of those failed experiments showed us one thing. We have to see past our shared baggage of Web2 compensation models, where the main way to get compensated is to get a salary once a task is done. Web3 technologies are offering us new ways to share the value created while attributing the merit to the right people, and we must seize this opportunity to build better coordination models and organizations.\n\n## 3 - It’s Time To Come Up With Revolutionary Ideas\n\nSure, *“We’rE So EarLy”* - and there might not be any clear-cut solutions to contributor compensation yet. But we are optimists, and there are so many experiments we could run.\n\nWhat about exploring ways to fix this token compensation paradox from a protocol-side. There are so many Web3 native solutions and mechanics which would enable a more fair distribution of funds without compromising a social token’s in-built utility, governance, or compliance with securities’ laws. Think about mechanics such as staking, delegation of governance power based on merit, and emission curves. In DAOs with diversified treasuries, we could also envision contributors hand-picking their desired mix of stablecoins (or any token in the treasury) and the DAO token for compensation through customizable smart contracts. In the beginning, contributors would want more stability (90-10 mix), but as they entrench themselves in your community, the more they would tip the scales towards reputation (50-50).\n\nFinally, another interesting solution has recently popped into the scene: tying your reputation to soul-bound tokens and on-chain credentials. While our platforms still have a long way to go in terms of security and actual use-cases for this type of tokens, the promise is there for a non-speculative asset that serves the only purpose of being your web3 ticket to access based on merit. By properly leveraging Soulbound Tokens and offering enough flexibility in their properties, communities could have the key to proper liquidity through their tokens, without compromising their contributor’s reputation, or the DAO’s treasury.\n\nWe can play around with the formulae for due recognition of work however we please, even involving systems that may or may not pay people **before** they complete a certain task based on their already accrued merit. We need only look at the chain, social tokens, NFTs, and all of the other tools we have at our disposal to make this process human-centric and token-enabled.\n\n## Closing thoughts\n\nWe really are just scratching the surface in how we approach the future of work.\n\nWeb3 projects are very different beasts to your average Silicon Valley startup. In order to find a way to compensate the people making all of this happen, we could explore the seasonality of DAOs, our product cycles and monetization. There’s so much to experiment with when it comes to people’s relationship to impact, legacy and the future they want to see.

Hence, they needed a way to create a task for their team.\n\n## Discovery\n\nAs part of the discovery process we had client interviews and input from the Customer Success team. Based on it, we created a list of requirements we needed to fulfill when creating a task:\n\n1. A title for the task\n2. A description for the task\n3. Any attachments that were relevant for the assignee to complete the task\n4. There were 2 modes\n   1. Simple task\n   2. Task with To-dos\n5. Had to be scheduled for a specific day\n   1. Could have a specific completion time\n   2. Could be a one time task\n   3. Could be a repetitive task\n      1. Repetitive tasks had a set of different variations\n6. Had to be assigned to different people\n   1. Could be assigned to individuals\n   2. Could be assigned to the whole store\n\n![Initial design for the task creation flow](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_6YXJqNlndKYV5hvyBJro.png?height=900&width=1600&size=medium)\n\n## Decisions\n\nAs it was a lot of information, we decided to break the creation into a step by step flow that reduced the cognitive noise and help them focus on the task at hand. It ended up being divided into a 4 section flow.\n\n![Step by step process for the task creation flow](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LrZhTccgYeAMLUunI7bDw.png?height=900&width=1600&size=medium)\n\n### Details\n\nThe details section grouped everything that was related with the information the Assignee needed to know in order to be able to complete the task:\n\n* Title\n* Description\n* Attachments\n\n![Task details](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o0u6bmedomK1yPmTw0fVr.png?height=900&width=1600&size=medium)\n\n### To dos\n\nDuring the validation process we realised there were 2 main type of tasks: The ones that were a simple confirmation task (I’ve made it), while other required more actions. The actions that we identified during our research were:\n\n* Checklist (sub-tasks)\n* Take a picture\n* Attach a file\n* Write something\n* Multiple choice\n* Rating\n\nBased on this, the second part of the flow was focused on helping the user choose what type of task to create.\n\n![Different options to select the type of to-do to add to the task (or not)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uA6K8KC82sN8ojkLVF1mS.png?height=900&width=1620&size=medium)\n\n### Schedule\n\nAlso as part of our research and the data we had from the platform, we realised users created more repeating tasks than one time ones. That’s why we made this the default option. Also, we added the “Advanced settings” feature, which gave the users the flexibility to schedule their tasks with very complex settings while keeping it simple at first sight.\n\n![Different options for scheduling a task](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y8b40fy7ArOeGE_pQDxG4.png?height=900&width=1600&size=medium)\n\n### Assign\n\nThe last step of the flow was who to assign the task to. Users had the option to assign the task to a whole location where just 1 person from that location could complete it (Close the store, for example) and it’d be completed for everyone who belong to that store, or to a specific individual. We referenced Whatsapp and Facebook’s way of doing this in mobile, and mixed it with our specific needs.\n\n![Different states for the task assign step](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zITH2QQydiAZmlZoXJwm0.png?height=900&width=1600&size=medium)\n\n## Conclusion\n\n![All steps of the process](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4TVUut97y-mHcVgEUV2f-.png?height=900&width=1620&size=medium)\n\nIn the end, we came up with a flow that took users smoothly through the whole task creation process, assuring them they were doing that they wanted to do and guiding them all the time. This had a high rate of acceptance and rose task creation metrics, which made it a successful project.", "timestamp": 1658159890, "digest": "XPCEtwgwZsw1brsDl00ffgGEdujqTMWnNMivw9GGotU", "contributor": "0xaB0684A4AA2Bb286C7a6b7E7E9b5f660cb062A3d"}

I prefer to call it meta:verses as I believe that, just like the \"websites of the internet\", \"galaxies/planets of the universe\", the metaverse is going to be based on 'verses' that will have different functions/mechanisms & use cases.\n\nGamefied NFTs: AKA “Artistic Arcade Metaverses”, a concept derived/coined by me as an indie game dev & an amateur generative artist which involves \"crafting imaginary AI play into art pieces blended with interactive arcade inspired by classic retros or hyper-casual games that will be built & hosted alongside dynamic mechanisms on the blockchain\" & just like single pages of the web, these are simple/single or non-fungible verses of the metaverse.\n\nAs the NFT community evolves: we see different forms of creations, scaling from 1/1 arts to PFPs, from music NFTs to photography & a lot more; but the concept of having NFTs as games might seem new but will be understandable by a lot of people if exposed & will help create a fun filled community as challenges could be created by individuals or teams as I call it; a league of \"non-fungible gamers\" & unlike casual NFTs, these will be multiple editions based or ERC1155 because they are meant to be played by 'people'.\n\nThe concept of gamefied NFTs is both exclusive & inclusive, as all games are hosted on multiple servers like IPFS or itch.io, and these will provide links alongside these crafts that makes it shareable by exclusive owners to non-owners to make it inclusive unlike other NFTs. With these, a lot of indie game devs will be able to hop into the NFT scene as a whole new community of creatives, presently we see a lot of passionate indie game devs running down the drain or struggling to be recognized, as they are not given actual opportunities to expose their cranky creations because big game studios are dominating the scene, but with decentralization & the rise of gamefied NFTs, they'd be able to create exclusive games for the community & with that keep the passion alive. And these way game lovers who would like to play or replay some of these classics are given an opportunity.\n\nIn the blockchain: These could also be used as a medium of token creation, using the $ASH ecosystem & mechanism as an example which Pak tagged \"a token of creation through destruction\" where art pieces released under the ecosystem can be directly burned & used to create new tokens which are directly distributed to the owners/burners as a reward unlike the actual burning system across blockchains. This I site as the second phase of my crafts that I tagged \"Gamefied Fungibility & Interoperability\" this is the part where all gamefied NFTs are merged & can be achieved by either creating an AI blockchain protocol or actual AI blockchain that will power these creations; For (1) Fungibility: Just like $ASH, thousands/millions of gamefied NFTs built by creative devs will be directly burned by owners after playing, as a decentralized means of mining new fungible/social tokens & in return acts as a reward for playing, more like a little 'Play2Earn' games. This will be valued & dynamically balanced by the AI system & by the community using it. This will also serve as a medium of ‘burning’ NFTs & earn an arcade game as a reward… For (2) Interoperability: With an AI system that has the ability to communicate with multi-chains, interoperable transactions will be carried out with a little fee, moving NFTs from one chain to the other will be made easy and will also trigger the minting of new gamefied NFTs to the wallet of the person who carries out this transaction.\n\nIn the actual immersive metaverse: gamefied NFTs will become gem-like collectible mini-games, having read/watched things like \"ready player one\" where we see many mini games coming into play as a form of quest or just a fun play & some actually involving the authors of the OASIS, we could state an example to say to access a certain weapon you must complete this mini game,\n\nor just function as a sort of collectible to boast of like pokemon cards but played in a 2d virtual screen built within these 3d immersive worlds. We could have thousands of it placed across different part of \"meta:verses\" as actual arcade machines but will be more artistic as against the \"retro times\" where coins were inserted to play but here crypto(s) will be inserted to access these.\n\n“The metaverse” just like I stated earlier wouldn't be just immersive worlds, as we are already seeing mechanisms that will be super important in the metaverse, why others are waiting for a single immersive 3D MMORPG as a metaverse, the mechanisms are being put into play, like Pak's \"merge/mass\" this I believe is an actual metaverse of mechanism that is \"play/game\" based. Then the metaverse/meta:verses will be gradually scaled to virtual worlds of fantasies, stories, or just fun based immersive extensions of the internet.\n\nLet's build the metaverse bit by bit: \"one verse at a time\"!", "timestamp": 1658160866, "digest": "XMRNWkDpv4OohOeXZqxImG6s8Y_C_Cj4nTLmvucyg_c", "contributor": "0x29f76D7236A16b02D245d477304DDFEaF5989e1A"}

{"id": "M_D0QPWGC_bFDV3yKSUSn4YWBjvQaAuRUH3bfsTrP1s", "title": "#2 Les bases et les premières initiatives", "body": "Hello tout le monde,\n\nLes choses bougent très vite dans le web3 et il est intéressant de faire un état des lieux des solutions en place et à venir.\n\nIl faut bien rappeler que nous sommes au tout début d’un changement majeur, avant l’adoption de masse de cette technologie.\n\nAlors faisons, de nouveau, un point sur certains principes de bases.\n\n## Qu'est-ce qu'un NFT musical ?\n\nUn NFT musical est en général, la vente d’un fichier source (wav, mp3) en tant que jeton unique, avec, dans le cadre d’une sortie de titre, un nombre limité de token (NFT).\n\n## Qu'obtenez-vous avec un NFT musical ?\n\nEn créant son titre en NFT, l'artiste donne la propriété de son contenu et une fois que vous en êtes l’heureux propriétaire, vous pouvez soit conserver ou revendre le NFT. (si ce dernier prend de la valeur par exemple, comme avec une œuvre d’art).\n\nVous n’obtenez pas les droits d’auteur du contenu, sauf que certains artistes commencent déjà à intégrer une notion de \"redevances\" attachée au NFT. (vous touchez un % des ventes du streaming du titre)\n\nExemple avec la dernière sortie du rappeur **Nas** sur le site **[Royal](https://royal.io/editions/Nas-Rare)**\n\nLe NFT peut aussi inclure des tickets de concert, du merchandising ou un accès à un réseau de communication privé (l'accès à un **Discord** par exemple**)**.\n\nL'acquisition du NFT permet donc, en plus de supporter un artiste que vous aimez, de faire partie intégrante du projet, en ayant même un intéressement.\n\n**Ce que ça change par rapport au modèle actuel (Streaming) ?**\n\nComparé au modèle de **Spotify**, selon lequel une chanson vaut ce que les royalties disent qu'elle vaut, c'est l'artiste qui définit ses propres conditions et les auditeurs qui valorisent directement le prix du NFT.\n\n—-\n\nMaintenant ces quelques règles évoquées, faisons un tour des solutions en cours de développement, spécialement dédiées musique.\n\n**Ps :** Dans cette liste, je ne citerais pas les market place types Opensea, Rarible, Mintable etc qui intègrent des NFTS musicaux, mais qui ne sont pas dédiés aux NFT musicaux.\n\n## Pour la création\n\n**[Catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/)** est une des premières plateformes de création de NFT musicaux 1/1. Les musiciens peuvent diffuser leurs chansons en tant que NFT 1/1 directement auprès des collectionneurs. Encore en beta et non ouvert à tous.\n\n**[Sound](https://www.sound.xyz/)** permet, de créer des NFT musicaux et permet de créer des opportunités d'engagement exclusives. Non ouvert à tous.\n\n**[Zora](https://zora.co/)** n'est pas exclusif aux NFTs de musique, mais en embarque beaucoup. Non ouvert à tous.\n\n**[MintSongs](https://www.mintsongs.com/)** permet de vendre ses titres en NFT. Solution encore en beta, mais ouverte à tous.\n\n**[Async Art](https://async.art/music?tags=notable)** est une plateforme de création de NFT d’art, mais aussi de NFT musicaux.\n\n**[Royal](https://royal.io/)** lancé par l’artiste **3Lau**, un des premiers artistes à avoir sorti des NFT musicaux. Sa plateforme est encore en beta et s’adresse pour le moment aux très gros artistes.\n\n## DAO de musiciens\n\n« Le terme DAO signifie “decentralized autonomous organization” (organisation autonome décentralisée en français) et peut être décrit comme un protocole blockchain open-source régi par un ensemble de règles, créées par ses membres élus, qui exécutent automatiquement certaines actions sans avoir besoin d’intermédiaires.\n\nLes règles de la DAO sont intégrées dans un code informatique (Smart Contract), qui s’exécute de lui-même en fonction du comportement du protocole. Il n’est pas nécessaire d’interpréter ces règles de programme, car elles sont automatiquement mises en œuvre lorsque les conditions spécifiées se produisent. »\n\nLes DAO sont donc des écosystèmes au sein de la blockchain ou un musicien peut donc monnayer ses NFTs de musique dans une trésorerie DAO et décentraliser la propriété de son contenu parmi sa communauté via des NFTs et des jetons sociaux.\n\n**[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)** permet aux musiciens de créer des DAO pour leur projet d’artiste, de sortie d’album, d’EP ou de single, etc. \n\n**[Juicybox](https://juicebox.money/#/)** est une autre solution opensource qui permet de monter votre DAO..\n\n## Communautés\n\n**[Songcamp band](https://discord.com/invite/wHsJD2sTpc)**, est la première DAO crypto x music.

{"id": "TGStusLbzfQq2WNeSxDLtD4nklRITPJ1FKA-Dts3fsc", "title": "What Are Gamefied NFTs & Why Do They Matter In The Metaverse?", "body": "**Introduction to the \"meta:verses”**\n\nThe Metaverse according to me are interactive & immersive extensions of the Internet, that will be defined & differentiated by the \"game:fied\" mechanisms behind them. I prefer to call it meta:verses as I believe that, just like the \"websites of the internet\", \"galaxies/planets of the universe\", the metaverse is going to be based on 'verses' that will have different functions/mechanisms & use cases.\n\nGamefied NFTs: AKA “Artistic Arcade Metaverses”, a concept derived/coined by me as an indie game dev & an amateur generative artist which involves \"crafting imaginary AI play into art pieces blended with interactive arcade inspired by classic retros or hyper-casual games that will be built & hosted alongside dynamic mechanisms on the blockchain\" & just like single pages of the web, these are simple/single or non-fungible verses of the metaverse.\n\nAs the NFT community evolves: we see different forms of creations, scaling from 1/1 arts to PFPs, from music NFTs to photography & a lot more; but the concept of having NFTs as games might seem new but will be understandable by a lot of people if exposed & will help create a fun filled community as challenges could be created by individuals or teams as I call it; a league of \"non-fungible gamers\" & unlike casual NFTs, these will be multiple editions based or ERC1155 because they are meant to be played by 'people'.\n\nThe concept of gamefied NFTs is both exclusive & inclusive, as all games are hosted on multiple servers like IPFS or itch.io, and these will provide links alongside these crafts that makes it shareable by exclusive owners to non-owners to make it inclusive unlike other NFTs. With these, a lot of indie game devs will be able to hop into the NFT scene as a whole new community of creatives, presently we see a lot of passionate indie game devs running down the drain or struggling to be recognized, as they are not given actual opportunities to expose their cranky creations because big game studios are dominating the scene, but with decentralization & the rise of gamefied NFTs, they'd be able to create exclusive games for the community & with that keep the passion alive. And these way game lovers who would like to play or replay some of these classics are given an opportunity.\n\nIn the blockchain: These could also be used as a medium of token creation, using the $ASH ecosystem & mechanism as an example which Pak tagged \"a token of creation through destruction\" where art pieces released under the ecosystem can be directly burned & used to create new tokens which are directly distributed to the owners/burners as a reward unlike the actual burning system across blockchains. This I site as the second phase of my crafts that I tagged \"Gamefied Fungibility & Interoperability\" this is the part where all gamefied NFTs are merged & can be achieved by either creating an AI blockchain protocol or actual AI blockchain that will power these creations; For (1) Fungibility: Just like $ASH, thousands/millions of gamefied NFTs built by creative devs will be directly burned by owners after playing, as a decentralized means of mining new fungible/social tokens & in return acts as a reward for playing, more like a little 'Play2Earn' games. This will be valued & dynamically balanced by the AI system & by the community using it. This will also serve as a medium of ‘burning’ NFTs & earn an arcade game as a reward… For (2) Interoperability: With an AI system that has the ability to communicate with multi-chains, interoperable transactions will be carried out with a little fee, moving NFTs from one chain to the other will be made easy and will also trigger the minting of new gamefied NFTs to the wallet of the person who carries out this transaction.\n\nIn the actual immersive metaverse: gamefied NFTs will become gem-like collectible mini-games, having read/watched things like \"ready player one\" where we see many mini games coming into play as a form of quest or just a fun play & some actually involving the authors of the OASIS, we could state an example to say to access a certain weapon you must complete this mini game,\n\nor just function as a sort of collectible to boast of like pokemon cards but played in a 2d virtual screen built within these 3d immersive worlds. We could have thousands of it placed across different part of \"meta:verses\" as actual arcade machines but will be more artistic as against the \"retro times\" where coins were inserted to play but here crypto(s) will be inserted to access these.\n\n“The metaverse” just like I stated earlier wouldn't be just immersive worlds, as we are already seeing mechanisms that will be super important in the metaverse, why others are waiting for a single immersive 3D MMORPG as a metaverse, the mechanisms are being put into play, like Pak's \"merge/mass\" this I believe is an actual metaverse of mechanism that is \"play/game\" based. Then the metaverse/meta:verses will be gradually scaled to virtual worlds of fantasies, stories, or just fun based immersive extensions of the internet.\n\nLet's build the metaverse bit by bit: \"one verse at a time\"!", "timestamp": 1658160786, "digest": "Ke_S1-_NCiZEr8-7SrPOh3BhxpFFPIoPFNNJ2jIJiqg", "contributor": "0x29f76D7236A16b02D245d477304DDFEaF5989e1A"}

Nonetheless, let’s examine the reasons: (1) ain’t nobody got time for that. (2) any attempt at a complete explanation would be riddled with assumptions and inaccuracies. Nobody has observed every moment in spacetime, nor possesses the memory to remember, nor the processing capability to completely understand these events. The main point here is that there is a *reason for being* (not to be confused with purpose). The reason that ‘you’ exist is because your dad’s sperm fertilized your mom’s egg. Somewhere along the way, ‘you’ came into existence. However, the answer to the question “Why did you fall off your bike?” requires an infinitely precise answer in order to be 100% accurate (we obviously do not care about 100% accuracy in all cases, nor is 100% accuracy attainable). This is what we will explore in this post.\n\n### Elements of the Mind\n\nOkay, we do not care about The Big Bang when examining your current position in life. Instead, let’s view the most important part of reality -- your lifetime -- because everyone is the hero of their own story.\n\nLet’s begin at the moment in which “you” obtain consciousness\\* (ironically, a moment that nobody can remember). Upon accessing reality for the first time, “you” are immediately introduced to the **cause and effect protocol** of the universe, become aware of “your” existence (‘consciousness’), as well as develop an awareness of ‘thoughts’ and a procedure of thoughts (‘thinking’), achieve (some level of) control of your body and thinking (agency), and eventually learn from the environment (‘intelligence’, ‘cognition’, or as I like to say, ‘an ability to connect the dots’). In this case, the dots are bits of observed data (‘information’) interpreted as truth (‘knowledge’), which we store in our ‘memory’. The connections are a model that describes a functional i/o relation between bits (‘understanding’). Putting this all together, “we” exist as a conscious, intelligent agent of reality perceiving a sequence of moments (‘experience’) which we call life. It is almost as if reality is a Turing-Complete system (a BIG assumption) and our brains are a Turing Machine (another BIG assumption). The one thing missing in the Turing analogy is our ‘imagination’ -- the power to “see the unseen”. The reason that imagination is missing is because it is inconsistent with a Turing Machine, and thus makes humans extra interesting. The brain (our “interpretation engine”) is unique and not well understood. We are also skipping the sub-conscious element of this model for now … but will definitely discuss it later.\n\n### Trapped In The Present\n\nThe reason that we care about history is because we can learn things that may help us in the future. We start to learn the code of reality from personal observations. Then, we learn to communicate with others, trade ideas and inspiration with them, and trust their experiences and historical accounts of reality\\*\\**.* After all, we physically cannot observe *everything* ourselves. Your first conscious moment is different from my first moment, and our experiences may never overlap in any meaningful way (disregarding butterfly effects for now). We cannot recount the past with 100% certainty, especially events that we did not personally observe (and even when we do have an experience … our memory can still be fuzzy). In other words, you should keep the grain of salt in your lens. There are also complex mechanisms that influence our perception (such as assumptions, cognitive bias, motivation, feelings, emotions, and biology) of which we may not be aware in the moment (not to mention the physical limitations of our human senses). Perspective is gained with an account of bias. The famous motto from The Royal Society is pertinent here -- *Nullius in Verba* -- “take nobody’s word for it”.\n\n![A crude example of well-intentioned (perhaps) yet biased hearsay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dSC4WSKaPSXEgp5J1L9A.png?height=1945&width=2085)\n\nA historical account is more reputable when there is evidence to corroborate it’s truth. The most influential evidence garners mass consensus of its implication (a flawed mechanism for finding truth … though it does provide a clue). There is a well known saying “wisdom of the crowd”. There is also a lesser known but equally as important saying “fatality of the mob”. Consensus provides a signal on social dynamics more than anything. The objective of consensus is to win a majority, which is all about compromise\\*\\*\\*, not truth-seeking. There is another common phrase, “history is written by the winners”, which is not an entirely true statement in its literal translation but is an attempt to describe the common biases in historical accounting. The history textbooks are missing many individual accounts, particularly on the loser’s side. This is not all the publisher’s fault because there are typically less of the losers around after a significant historical event like war, but the missing context makes the book sensitive to a combination of conformity, misattribution, and survivorship bias.\n\n![Infinitism  -- The Ultimate Burden Of Proof -- aka The Absence of Evidence vs. Evidence of Absence Fallacy](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd070309s.gif)\n\nEvidence is built through discovery -- a gain of information which improves our understanding of the circumstances which produced the evidence. It is still up to humans to deduce valid conclusions from discoveries. We commonly mistake evidence as proof. Circumstantial evidence does not have the power to prove on its own. Rather, it can indicate the likelihood of a particular events’ existence, but not accurately until we drop it into context. A proper investigation entails observing each instance of history and each piece of evidence as independent from each other (and from that moment of history … not viewed as a “Bayesian” from the future) and then imagining the logical sequence of events to form dependencies, hence the phrase “drawing a conclusion”. Every piece of evidence or historical account has a level of faith associated with it (and we usually realize overconfidence). For example, the discovery of fossils indicates the existence of large, now-extinct beings. And we can even imagine what they looked like! However, the fossils and present-day graphical renderings do not prove dinosaurs’ existence. The evidence simply gives us a level of confidence. A different explanation for the existence of fossils could be that a scientist synthesized fossil materials in a lab and buried them to eventually claim fame once he/she later “discovers” them and proposes a breakthrough theory of dinosaurs. However, there are sound reasons that easily disprove this explanation, namely, there is no evidence of a scientist or lab in 1677 (when Robert Plot found the first fossil) that had the capability to synthesize an organic material that could resemble the form of a fossil.\n\n![The Gettier Problem (philosophy), Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems (math), and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (science) all arrive at the same idea from different disciplines -- proof requires complete information and infinite precision. Conjecture is imminent (we settle for \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" in court.)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/proof.png)\n\nEvidence is an empirical starting point. It exists in context. A thorough assessment of evidence addresses as much context as possible. At the same time, there will always be missing context, so we will never have a totally complete or perfectly accurate history. I call this *The* *Theory of Relative History*.\n\n### Explanations\n\nI once concluded that everything can be explained, so the world must be deterministic. I arrived at this conclusion after reading *[The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359)* by David Deutsch. I highly recommend reading it. In fact, it was the inspiration for this blog (if you don’t read books, then at least listen to Naval Ravikant’s *[The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0)* podcast series with Brett Hall breaking down the book). The big takeaway from the book is that omniscience is not required to have ‘creativity’ -- an ability to create new “things”. You do not need to know absolutely every fact that exists in order to understand everything that can be understood. Reality is most accurately described using good explanations, and there is an explanation for everything. The building blocks of explanations are **[First Principles](https://fs.blog/first-principles/#_ftn11)** -- namely the foundations of science (Relativity, Quantum, Evolution, Information, Computing, etc.) -- and the fuel is imagination.\n\n> *“What I cannot create, I do not understand”*\n>\n> \\-- Richard Feynman\n\nScience is an error-correcting machine. It disproves explanations and forms better ones. You will find that the most impactful explanations require intense imagination because they describe the *Unseen*:\n\n(1.) things that do not exist in the present moment and are of the past or future. For example, we can imagine hypotheticals.\n\n(2.) things which are not apparent to the senses, thus not observable. For example, we can measure the temperature of an atom’s nucleus, but we cannot observe the movement of quarks which are the cause (we think) of the temperature reading that we observe. Unobservable phenomena can be measured with special equipment, but we just observe the measurement readings on the equipment.\n\nAn explanation is not an explanation unless it is testable, falsifiable, and precisely answers “How?”. An explanation is our best guess. In this way, even good explanations are at risk of being inaccurate. This is okay because this is how we create new knowledge. A good explanation is our best understanding, our best description for how something works, why something happened, or why something will happen, at any given time. It is like the scientific method on steroids. A good explanation provides reasons and digs deep. It asks questions to get to the root. Try the **5 Why’s method** to improve the accuracy of an explanation.\n\n> *“Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.”*\n>\n> — Carl Sagan\n\nAs you can see from the bike example at the beginning, an explanation does not need to be entirely complete in order to be valuable because intelligent beings (humans) can identify patterns and make inferences. Again, a partially true, incomplete explanation can be sufficient if we only care about a certain level of accuracy. An explanation is measured by its explanatory power -- the degree to which an explanation accomplishes an objective. The objective can be (and usually is) to accurately describe or predict reality. Explanations have degrees of completeness based on the amount of information present in them\\*\\*\\*\\*. A thorough explanation leaves little to chance. A complete explanation leaves nothing to chance. The pinnacle of explanations is a perfect explanation -- 100% complete and 100% accurate. The ultimate explanation, a *Theory of Everything*, would be perfect. Many people have tried to find this explanation, such as Michio Kaku's *[The God Equation](https://www.amazon.com/God-Equation-Quest-Theory-Everything/dp/0385542747)* (I have not read yet), but none have succeeded.\n\nThe jury is still out on if a perfect explanation exists.\n\n### Truth\n\nOur initial guess for how knowledge exists is known as the ‘justified true belief’ theory of knowledge. This theory says that knowledge is about justifying your beliefs as true. It then goes on to say that if you accomplish this, then your belief is Truth (with a capital ‘T’). This a misconception because there is no logical way to prove any bit of knowledge as Truth (see [epistemic regress](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/knowledge/infinite_regress.html)). One can provide evidence, but this is not proof. If an explanation prevails against attempts to disprove it, then it is consistent with Truth and is probably considered useful. Yet, we can never know with 100% certainty that the explanation accurately describes a fundamental Truth (a “law” of nature\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*) because there is always a chance that we discover new information debunking that explanation. Then, we simply come up with a better explanation.\n\nThe first step to finding truth is to develop a theory of knowledge (epistemology). I subscribe to the theory that knowledge is an interpretation of information that is accepted as truth and can be measured for accuracy and significance. This implies knowledge is subjective i.e. your truth may not be my truth.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xwFu_2fyTN7kfq6Mi8bBH.png?height=792&width=1561)\n\nIn the end, knowledge is simply an iterative assumption. Humans seek highly objective knowledge because we get rewarded with better predictions. Nassim Taleb describes a concept of *non-observables*, in his *[Incerto](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Deluxe-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/198481981X)* (my favorite is *[The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Impact-Improbable-Incerto/dp/1400063515/ref=asc_df_1400063515/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312106851030&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11165397501409576070&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010943&hvtargid=pla-330161967766&psc=1)*). There will always be unknowns and we do not know the significance of the unknowns. The highly significant non-observables are The Black Swans. We don't know for sure what will effect us, kill us, or save us. It may not be real today.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kWP9k4Mb0aJLmmm6JXgSD.png?height=697&width=1114)\n\nExplanations can retrospectively describe causation and also make reasonable predictions → which builds information and iterates knowledge → which inspires imagination → which creates explanations. These ‘creations’ bring a truth into existence that did not exist before (or at least did not exist to ‘you’). It is quite liberating when you realize that explanations are created with imagination, so in theory, you can understand anything! Regardless of whether or not information is infinite\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, knowledge is not scarce. It is the product of intelligence and unbounded imagination and is stored in memory.\n\nKeep in mind, reality is unbiased. It is Truth. It just is\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is the purest form of objectivity (no interpretation necessary). Frankly, reality does not care about you (or anything). Reality is left to humans for interpretation. The most useful application of this realization is to practice acceptance because the world is not out to get you. At the same time, we are an agent of change capable of effecting our own lives. For every effect, there is a cause\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. For every output, there is an input. You may notice the continuity of this universal model. But what happens when there is a discontinuity in the model? And what does a gap represent?\n\n### Randomness\n\nThe answer is randomness -- uncertainty attributed to an absence of information. This is where we can assign probabilities rather than determinations of the future. The important thing here is that reality is not intrinsically random or uncertain … with one theoretical exception. The only proposed natural randomness in the universe is the phenomena described by quantum mechanics -- an explanation for how matter and energy behaves as spacetime approaches zero. Even in quantum, we have some predictive ability of the probability distribution of subatomic particles in spacetime. This gets more interesting if you consider quantum randomness in a multiplicative series of moments. As you can see, each sequential moment gets increasingly difficult to predict and eventually the complexity explodes, leading most scientists to chaos theory and the multiverse\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*.\n\nAll other probability is subject to a knowledge base. This means that any likelihood which we attributed to an event’s existence is a function of our ignorance. When humans say “I am uncertain”, we are admitting that we do not know a critical piece of information that would make the Truth apparent. We can reduce uncertainty and increase the accuracy of our predictions by reducing knowledge gaps (not to be confused with information gaps). Here are two ways to reduce knowledge gaps and improve predictability:\n\n1\\.) empirical methods -- inducing a hypothesis from experience.\n\n2\\.) explanatory methods -- deducing a cause and effect relation from imagination.\n\nThese methods are most powerful when deployed in tandem.\n\nEmpirical methods infer an independent factor (causal inference) from observations or experimental results (statistics). This is useful to identify information gaps. You can gain (uncover) information by changing the conditions (i.e. varying the independent variable to see the change in the dependent variable). Here’s a hint, when correlations between events approach 100%, you may getting closer to a causal relationship (though there still may be ‘Hidden’ variables\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* which are the actual root cause). However, correlation is not causation\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* …. so … how do you know if the measured response in the ‘effect variable’ was the result of varying the ‘cause variable’ or if the independent factors are truly independent themselves? Enter explanations.\n\nThis is how explanatory methods save the day. Explanations describe ‘the seen’ in terms of ‘the unseen’ -- information not represented in the statistics -- and can implicate an unknown factor as the root cause. The reasoning offered in an explanation is based in ‘possibility’ as opposed to ‘probability’ (though probability can also appear in an incomplete explanation). When something is deemed ‘unexplainable’, this indicates either a severe information gap or a lapse in imagination.\n\nI suggest watching Vsauce's YouTube video: \"[What is Random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0)\" and Veritasium’s sister episode: \"[What is Not Random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE)\" to further explore randomness as a property of ignorance.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE)\n\nTo quickly make better predictions, acquire fundamental knowledge. Search for the fundamental factors of reality, the ones with high explanatory power. Lean on *First Principles* thinking or even better -- [Zeroth-Principles Thinking](https://medium.com/future-literacy/zeroth-principles-thinking-9376d0b7e7f5). After all, explanations are the best way to hunt the Truth. On the other hand, we will always have to make decisions with incomplete information, and thus are exposed to uncertainty … so get used to it!\n\nI glossed over the fact that “meaning” is an important part of the brain’s interpretation engine. Sooo … what is meaning? Is meaning created or intrinsic to reality? If we assume that reality is deterministic, then can meaning exist or can we have free will? Can there be a meaning of life? If we assume that life has meaning, then what is the meaning? My best answer right now: the meaning of life is to create value. More on that in the next post…\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*I assume ownership of consciousness for the sake of understanding; rather, consciousness spontaneously “exists” without an agent or precise initial moment and is “you”. I enjoyed Brett Hall’s view of [ontology](https://www.bretthall.org/blog) --an explanation of being--what does it mean to exist. The model that I describe requires a definition for the concept of “you” (a whole exercise itself). I use a version of “you” that is a figment of the brain and represents an identity. “You” is awareness that exists as a state of consciousness. I also enjoyed Evan Conrad’s [article](https://evanjconrad.com/posts/how-to-feel-good) which offers a view that “you” are not your “thoughts” and suggests practical applications of this knowledge. “You” observe thoughts. At the same time, you have agency of thinking in the sense that you may be aware of a thought or feelings and its relation to “you” (as an identity that has control of an interpretation engine which does thinking procedures and serves the next thought). I would like to add that you are not your feelings. In Conrad’s view, both thoughts and feelings are real “to” you, rather than “are” or “of” you.\n\n\\*\\*Yes, trust in fellow humans is risky, but the payoffs have historically outweighed the costs. There are concepts of infinite games in Game Theory which incentivize cooperation in most instances.\n\n\\*\\*\\*We will explore the mechanisms of consensus in another post.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*Completeness is a function of access and precision. Explanations are incomplete when they are missing info. This is almost always the case when expressing explanations in spoken language because language itself is imprecise. A good question: can we know all information?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* When describing physical reality, there is no such thing as a “law of nature” or Truth (with a capital ‘T’) since the description exists in the abstract realm of knowledge. There are just REALLY good explanations (called theories in science) that may resemble physical Truth because of their accuracy in describing and predicting phenomena, but we would never know for certain. However, there is a Truth. It exists and exists as reality. This implies the existence of False (with a capital ‘F’). Knowledge is abstract thought -- an interpretation of information which exists relative to reality (Truth/False) -- and can actually be True or False when describing knowledge, but not reality.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*The more important and deeper question is whether reality is continuous or discrete. This question is most famously illustrated via [Zeno’s Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes). Modern science does not even have a consensus on this answer. I think the answer requires a better understanding of time and information. Is information a property of reality? Does reality exist as a state of information at (that changes changes between?) moments of time? Can we create new “things” (real or abstract)? Does the set of information (as elements) grow, accumulate, remain static, or simply change?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*I suppose the ultimate truth is whether reality itself exists or not.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*We may explore whether the inverse is necessarily true, which requires a consideration of infinity. What happens when you consider time (the temporal relationship between cause and effect)? The most convincing concept of time that I can understand is that time represents a relation between moments of reality. In this concept, a moment is a state of information (reality) and time is the relation of moments -- The God Equation -- rather than the moment. Therefore, there are instances of information, rather than instances of time. Time describes change. It *is* change. If time is a relation mapping a state of info to another state of info, which [type](https://t-redactyl.io/blog/2021/03/types-of-functions-injective-surjective-and-bijective.html) of relation is it?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*We may address these concepts at some point. We perceive time as a sequence of moments (maybe a series when considering our memory), but time may not actually “be” an ordered sequence of moments. We do not have access to all of reality (information), which leads to gaps in information and knowledge (understanding). Also, knowledge lags information. The Truth Spectrum is not to be confused with true vs. false in logic. It is more closely related to the concept of [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) in Information Theory.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Any statistical model can attempt to predict reality. Some models are capable of making accurate predictions (though maybe not significant). Yet, any model trying to predict reality assumes a complete and closed system. We can use a model to make inferences about things not in the data, but non-observables belong to the realm of possibility (unknown unknowns), not probability (known unknowns). A change in the dependent variable (effect) may be caused by an unaccounted or unknown factor (cause) rather than the independent factor. This may be “confounding'“ to some. Others say Hidden variables, once identified in an experiment, are “extraneous” if they think they can be controlled. It is hard to control variables (especially unknown ones) in experiments, and physical experiments are temporal in nature.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Correlation is an association between sets, not a function. Causality is a function of sorts.\n\nPS: I promise future blogs will not be this long.", "timestamp": 1658161577, "digest": "MBShaUZiXxaQ3Da512suqM6nTAL4hD7OyPPakdoRzKg", "contributor": "0x8FA9E69BA39A209e6D105c6ccfd82e7c2c5Af28f"}

Une seule invention est c’est la révolution industrielle.” - Lip dans la série culte [Shameless ](https://www.allocine.fr/series/ficheserie_gen_cserie=7634.html)👈 😀\n\nLe modèle en place est-il juste ?\n\nEt si une oeuvre digitale pouvait être unique ?\n\nAvoir, de nouveau, une valeur !\n\nVotre dernier single, doit-il forcément valoir 0,0033ct€ par écoute ?\n\n#### Un modèle centré sur l’artiste et le fan\n\nCe changement a déjà commencé avec l’arrivée de plateformes alternatives comme **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/)** ou **Kickstarter**.\n\nLe fan est impliqué à un niveau plus important dans le projet de l’artiste et reçoit des contre-parties en échange d’un financement participatif.\n\n**Et avec les NFTs, la relation artiste/fan va encore plus loin.**\n\nEn achetant un NFT, ils achètent un actif de l’artiste, qui peut prendre de la valeur (pour l’artiste\\* et pour le fan) ; le succès devient dès lors, **relationnel**.\n\n\\*chaque NFT comprend généralement une part du créateur - un pourcentage qui revient à l'artiste chaque fois que le NFT est revendu - lui permettant de gagner de l'argent pour toujours.\n\nLa blockchain se charge de valider et d’automatiser ces transactions, éliminant ainsi, certains intermédiaires et les problématiques de \"mauvais contrats\" ou de \"fausses promesses\".\n\n#### Une réglementation qui ne suit pas encore\n\nAvant que les NFTs n'entrent dans la danse, la propriété de la musique était déjà complexe : chaque enregistrement sonore est protégé par de multiples droits d'auteur, et chaque utilisation distincte :\n\n* Jouer une chanson\n* En faire une copie\n* La diffuser\n* La jouer en synchronisation avec un contenu visuel\n\nIl faut maintenant ajouter à cela le cadre de “ténu de la propriété numérique”, car la propriété juridique d'un fichier numérique n'existe pas à ce jour.\n\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nApporter le web3 dans l’industrie musicale, c’est voir les artistes reprendre le pouvoir sur leur art, sur leurs flux de revenus avec la possibilité de les partager avec leurs consommateurs/fans s’ils le souhaitent.\n\nC’est aussi voir les fans devenir des fans **actifs**.\n\nDepuis juin 2020, plus de 1,6 million de NFT musicaux ont été vendus, générant un chiffre d'affaires d'environ 100 millions de dollars.\n\nLe changement est donc déjà en marche, mais la route est encore longue pour que les acteurs majeurs de cette industrie acceptent de revoir ce qui leur paraissaient comme acquis.\n\n\n---\n\n### Si tu es cool avec l’anglais, voici quelques lectures :\n\n* **[Revuto](https://nftnewstoday.com/2022/07/09/revuto-launches-10000-revulution-nfts-unlocking-spotify-or-netflix-for-life/)**[ lance la souscription Netflix & Spotify à vie, en NFTs](https://nftnewstoday.com/2022/07/09/revuto-launches-10000-revulution-nfts-unlocking-spotify-or-netflix-for-life/)\n* **[Timbaland](https://www.nftnewsmania.com/timbaland-presents-congo-nft-nft-culture-nfts-crypto-art/)**[ présente Congo NFTs](https://www.nftnewsmania.com/timbaland-presents-congo-nft-nft-culture-nfts-crypto-art/)\n* [Le collectif ](https://www.billboard.com/pro/camp-chaos-songcamp-nfts-50-person-band/)**[Songcamp](https://www.billboard.com/pro/camp-chaos-songcamp-nfts-50-person-band/)**[ mis en avant sur ](https://www.billboard.com/pro/camp-chaos-songcamp-nfts-50-person-band/)**[Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/pro/camp-chaos-songcamp-nfts-50-person-band/)**\n* [Les réflexions d’Annika Rose après avoir participé au NFT NYC](https://twitter.com/AnnikaRoseSings/status/1542600877034307586?s=20&t=Bvgja3oagsnXvvuDon2kVA)\n* [Pharell Williams devient le ](https://www.complex.com/music/pharrell-named-chief-brand-officer-doodles-nft?utm_campaign=musictw&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social)**[Chief Brand Officer du projet NFT Doodles](https://www.complex.com/music/pharrell-named-chief-brand-officer-doodles-nft?utm_campaign=musictw&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social)**\n\n\n---\n\n### Liens utiles\n\n* [Le lexique du Web3 par ](https://nft-mania.io/2021/08/le-grand-lexique-des-nft/)**[NFT Mania](https://nft-mania.io/2021/08/le-grand-lexique-des-nft/)**[ & ](https://nft-mania.io/2021/08/le-grand-lexique-des-nft/)**[NFT francophone](https://nft-mania.io/2021/08/le-grand-lexique-des-nft/)**\n* **[Spinamp](https://app.spinamp.xyz/listen)**[, un des tous premiers players de NFTs](https://app.spinamp.xyz/listen)\n* **[Side.events :](https://side.events/)**[ Annuaire des événements Web3 autour de toi](https://side.events/)\n* **[Gamestop](https://nft.gamestop.com/)**[, nouveau market place qui a le vent en poupe](https://nft.gamestop.com/)", "timestamp": 1658161636, "digest": "U72InJRPjzubsKgXumtvl0RzWpw3e0wOeHDqQcX5ZHw", "contributor": "0xaF1Ae141054B323f031841495B5e6Ae0cbA4D9D6"}

{"id": "3gfksSOm6c-_4iIeQgW5PGRIylktMK-ipKRK0atx7yg", "title": "Mips (MIPS.ST) Analysis", "body": "*I’m not a professional and I’m not recommending anything. Just sharing my thoughts.*\n\n**General:**\n\nMips is a company specializing on brainprotection for helmets. The company is world leading and started its research phase at 1996, had their first prototype ready 2000. Year 2015, over 1 million helmets had the mips technology implemented and 2017 they got listed on Nasdaq.\n\nThe technique purpose is to reduce rotational forces to the head and brain during impact by reducing friction between head and helmet. This is reducing the risk of brain tissue stretching that would normally lead to brain damages during impact. Mips got around 300 patents and the components production is outsourced to another company in Shenzhen, China (90%). This is associated with risk, but pretty much all helmet producer share the same geographical risk since most helmets are produced in this region. The helmets are easy to recognize in the stores, they all have a yellow sticker and the salesmans are well aware of the benefits of using this kind of helmet.\n\nMips have a total adressable market of 410 million helmets, with their newly entered market, safetyhelmets consists of 310 million helmets. The focus market as of know consists of 130 million helmets of wich they still only have a 10% market share!\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ddc8d32-b912-4fa3-aa31-053e4115e2e8_808x828.png)\n\n**Business model:**\n\nMips businessmodel is built on royalties from other helmet manifacturers. The helmets are in a price range with a minimum price of 150 SEK ($15) into 3 different segments, bycicle, sport and safety (industrial and law enforcement) helmets. It’s a cheap insurance that everyone should be having and I believe that if they would need to increase the prices, the company would not feel any negative effects from that. Those who already uses helmets will continue to do so regardless and in the other segments, motorcycle, riding, teamsport or industry there are laws forcing users to have helmets.\n\nRecently Mips have benefited from law changes in 2020 when a test-standard for motorcycle helmet producers came through from Federacion indernationale motorcyclisme. The tests forces producers to do tests on rotational forces on impact. There have been discussions about implementing similar standards in other sports and practices too, but we will have to wait more for that.\n\nBike helmets have always been the main business. The safety helmets is a new segment that got added 2019 and still haven’t had a big success. The reason seems to be the long process to get a contract with bigger manufacturers. However, in april 2022 they announced a collaboration with Uvex who is one of the biggest producers globally for safety equipment (revenues of €534M during fiscal year 20/21). How this will effect Mips is something we have to wait and see, but recent comments from Mips have been that they want to ramp up and reach bigger volumes in this segments some time during 2022.\n\nIn november they launched a virtual testlab that lets helm designers test their models on a computer before doing it physically. This means that a test-simulation only takes 10 days to complete instead of the previous 50 days. Totally there have been 50 000 tests (according to the news report 2021).\n\nMips have through the years been competitive. Year 2021, 12 million helmets with Mips tech got sold, the year before it was 7,2million. Third-part tests have been done. Mips bike helmets are considerably better than the competitors, in the top 10, 9 of the helmets using Mips. Top 10 in snowboarding have 5.\n\nFull list: <https://helmet.beam.vt.edu/bicycle-helmet-ratings.html>\n\nThere are a few competitors but they are small and limited. They promise more than they can provide as of know. Last time I heard about a bigger threat was when Trek and Bontragers new helmets 2019 was provided with a newly made material called WaveCel that was supposed to be 48x better than a traditional helmet and 3-12x better than Mips. WaveCels tests was then proved to be insufficient. Hövding is another competitor but they have an airbag solution but it’s not really popular, either it’s because it’s not convenient, the price of 300€ is to much or because people don’t trust that kind of technology yet. It also needs to be charged to use (alot of people seem to have battery problems too), you also need to put it in idle to not activate when not being on the bike. According to insurance company Folksam, it’s not a helmet to trust. 2020 It got a “trusted”-grade by Folksam but have since then been removed (while all Mips helmet tested got a good grade).\n\nCompetition is not on the same lever yet.\n\nAnother competitor entering the research phase is public swedish company Autoliv (7 billion SEK market cap, making safetysystems for cars) together with helmet manufacturer POC to make a helmet with a airbag solution also. However, this one is going to try to apply Mips businessmodel instead of Hövdings and as mentioned is just in the research state.\n\n**Financials**\n\nThe debt of the company is non-existent.  They can really decide to pay of their debts whenever they want. They have a cash account of 98M SEK and total debts of 106M. They are not capital intensive either. The operating cash flow the last 2 years have been 277M SEK (116M SEK) with cash flow in investing staying at low -11M SEK (-15M SEK) that contributes to a strong free cash flow. Top-line CAGR is at 27% between 2016-2021. Gross margins at around 75% and G&A and R&D to sales getting lower and lower for every year. EBIT margin 2021 was at 53% with a net margin of 41%. Q1 2022 have also shown strong sales with a revenue growth of 65%.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd94b6654-34e4-49c4-a79a-b72857120af3_576x246.png)\n\nAlso, notice the ROIC the last years. Worth mentioning that Mips had problems growing during corona mainly due to lack of components at the helmet factories. There is a big order backlog with accounts receivables to sales beeing at 1,24 wich is very high considering that they have been between 0,25 to 0,35 the last 5 years.\n\nAccording to my own calculation, Mips is making around 21 SEK ($2,1) per helmet sold on average (97% of revenue is sales of helmets, 3% is services). With those numbers, the sales could theoretically look something like this (unless the focusmarket is NOT getting bigger, wich it acutally should)\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93a01bbe-a28f-462c-8cdb-41257b1d72db_421x131.png)\n\nRight now they are still scaling up the business at fast pace. Capex very low in comparison to opex. I guess they are at a point soon where they will need the money to either buy a company or share the profits with the shareholders in other ways. Going forward Mips have a goal of 2027 reach revenues of 2B SEK, operating results (EBITDA)-margins at 50% and pay out a dividend of 50% of net income.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nOf course the companies strong financial status and big potential for growth have effected the valuation of the company alot. Market cap is currently at 12 Billion SEK with a P/E of 47. Even though there have been a massive fall of 60% from the top. Based on Mips own goals of 2 billion in revenues and my belief that they will keep a net margin of 40%. This would mean a 800M SEK bottomline. A P/E at 12-15 would give is a market capo f between 9,6B – 12B SEK. Wich is a stock price of 362 SEK to 452 SEK year 2027. However, I am optimistic that they will be able to reach revenues greater than that and also to be valued at levels higher than what I expect, but with that a bigger market share, merger&acquisitions and new markets and sacrificing short term earnings would be needed.\n\n**Catalyst**\n\n> -          Scaling up safety segment (industry/law enforcement)\n>\n> \\-          Bigger market share of focus area\n>\n> \\-          Merger & acqusition", "timestamp": 1658162361, "digest": "JnBoyrKlAAJiSNcDBj2QgIpDihoX6lE2J3UVC8uM-7U", "contributor": "0x1C0930289E78209b84eb886C90882E1bF42faa38"}

Just sharing my thoughts.*\n\n## **General:**\n\nWinner of danish e-commerce award 2022 for companies with revenues below 100M DKK. Freetrailers business is lending trailers and now more recently e-bikes (with big baskets for goods transportation) in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Germany through an app to unlock a bluetooth lock either for free or very cheap. Their model is to rent their service to a partner that have access to a big parking, Freetrailers put the other companies logo on the trailer (that way the other company can market themselves) and is also doing the maintenance of all the trailers. The contracts are usually around 3-4 years. They are also making money from the consumers using the trailers, but more of that later.\n\nAlof of big companies are currently using Freetrailers services, IKEA is a long-term customer. Others worth mentioning is ICA (biggest grocery store in Sweden), COOP (2nd biggest grocery chain), Elgiganten (popular technology store), REMA 1000 (big grocery store in Norway+Denmark), Europris (biggest grocery store in Norway. Alot of other big hardware/bulding material stores such as Byggmax, Beijer, Woody, and XL Bygg are also connected. Having Freetrailer have become a way to attract customers. However, the users of the trailer DO NOT need to shop at the retailer where they are renting the trailer.\n\nThe utilization rate for the trailers is up to 89% (Denmark 90%, Sweden 97%, Norway 69% and Germany 20%). However, the utilization rate is calculated by number of bookings divided by days (you rent the trailer until the store opens the next day, most people do give it back much earlier though). What I can see myself in the app, they are less popular during the working days, but every trailer is used several times a day in the weekends, this is what is boosting the number.\n\n**The app:**\n\nThe app have over 100 000 downloads on Google play with 10 000 reviews and an average score of 4.8 out of 5 stars. There is a big flow of positive comments, the few ones that are giving 1 star is due to technical issues (such as the trailer not opening for different reasons). Those commenters are being contacted by freetrailers support. The app made keeping track of unused trailers easier and have also made is possible for people to lend it when the store is closed.\n\n\\*\\*Consumers: \\*\\* The biggest share of the revenue comes from the consumers (70%), partners account for 20% and other is 10%.

Just sharing my thoughts.*\n\n## **General:**\n\nWinner of danish e-commerce award 2022 for companies with revenues below 100M DKK. Freetrailers business is lending trailers and now more recently e-bikes (with big baskets for goods transportation) in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Germany through an app to unlock a bluetooth lock either for free or very cheap. Their model is to rent their service to a partner that have access to a big parking, Freetrailers put the other companies logo on the trailer (that way the other company can market themselves) and is also doing the maintenance of all the trailers. The contracts are usually around 3-4 years. They are also making money from the consumers using the trailers, but more of that later.\n\nAlof of big companies are currently using Freetrailers services, IKEA is a long-term customer. Others worth mentioning is ICA (biggest grocery store in Sweden), COOP (2nd biggest grocery chain), Elgiganten (popular technology store), REMA 1000 (big grocery store in Norway+Denmark), Europris (biggest grocery store in Norway. Alot of other big hardware/bulding material stores such as Byggmax, Beijer, Woody, and XL Bygg are also connected. Having Freetrailer have become a way to attract customers. However, the users of the trailer DO NOT need to shop at the retailer where they are renting the trailer.\n\nThe utilization rate for the trailers is up to 89% (Denmark 90%, Sweden 97%, Norway 69% and Germany 20%). However, the utilization rate is calculated by number of bookings divided by days (you rent the trailer until the store opens the next day, most people do give it back much earlier though). What I can see myself in the app, they are less popular during the working days, but every trailer is used several times a day in the weekends, this is what is boosting the number.\n\n**The app:**\n\nThe app have over 100 000 downloads on Google play with 10 000 reviews and an average score of 4.8 out of 5 stars. There is a big flow of positive comments, the few ones that are giving 1 star is due to technical issues (such as the trailer not opening for different reasons). Those commenters are being contacted by freetrailers support. The app made keeping track of unused trailers easier and have also made is possible for people to lend it when the store is closed.\n\n\\*\\*Consumers: \\*\\* The biggest share of the revenue comes from the consumers (70%), partners account for 20% and other is 10%. You don’t actually need to pay for using the trailer, but on the weekend, they are so popular that making the reservation fee of 29SEK and with (49SEK) or without (0SEK)  insurance is worth it (without insurance you will have to pay somewhere between 150SEK (broken or lost adapter) to 4500 SEK (stolen trailer) based on damage/delayed return etc. Like I mentioned before, it’s possible to lend the trailer until before the store opens the next day.

With a hypnotic timbre, Mark Zuckerberg tells a story about the world to come that says everything there will be just as it is here. Just as our room is now, so it will be in the world to come; where our baby sleeps now, there too it will sleep in the other world. And the clothes we wear in this world, those too we will wear there. Everything will be as it is now, just differently textured.\n\nThe familiarity of variable-poly surfaces, however, belies the novel forms of visuality that animate the metaverse. Beneath the illusory layer of avatars and environments, techniques such as subtle gaze direction exploit research on human visual cognition and attention, while computer vision algorithms are refined by data synthesized using computer graphics. For humans, these new images operate below the threshold of perception; for machines, they provide the foundation of perception. Machine learning models trained on synthetic data, which is diverse and perfectly labeled by design, generalize better than models trained on real data, enabling avatars to represent users in granular detail. The development of immersive technologies constitutes its own form of vision.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z0PeTXBZUBO9hyIKVK9T3.jpeg?height=883&width=1365&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&)\n\nSMPLverse NFTs use facial recognition to retrieve [data synthesized by Microsoft to train face tracking algorithms for its mixed reality headsets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.15102.pdf). Like many pfp projects, the Microsoft dataset uses procedural generation to randomly create and render faces without any manual intervention. The images combine a generative 3D face model with a library of artist-created assets—including textures, hair, and clothing—and SMPL, a body mesh used to animate avatars in virtual environments. Though the synthetic images are indifferent to human vision, they tempt an overidentification: their verisimilitude is formally irrelevant to machine learning, yet it remains the only method of achieving functional equivalence with real data.\n\nAfter minting, you receive a token with which you can submit an image through a webcam interface. Your submitted image is written to the token as a hash and matched to the next-closest smpl using a facial recognition model. Whereas the matched image mimics the form of your identity, the hash stored in the token preserves its content, although indecipherably (the image is hashed using a one-way compression function). When the image is matched, it receives one attribute: confidence. Confidence assesses the likelihood that your image matches the smpl you receive. Confidence is a declining measure: as more smpls are matched, your likelihood of receiving a high confidence match decreases.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ua2pugKf_c16nk4xt8MhA.png?height=512&width=1024&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&)\n\nVisually, the training images suggest identity play, emulating the avatars whose naturalism they are meant to enhance. Their effect, however, is to attune algorithms ever more precisely to users’ physical selves: the dataset expresses how users appear to virtual environments as much as how they appear in them. The minting process elaborates this tension between individual agency and computational constraint, voluntarism and determinism. Even a pool of 100,000 images is too small to consistently produce high confidence matches.\n\nUnlike the elective avatars that crowd the metaverse’s surface, SMPLverse NFTs are avatars for the metaverse’s infrastructure. Beyond digital culture’s native identity paradigm—[whereby identity is constructed and maintained strategically, as if from a third person perspective](https://gilbert.mirror.xyz/T_tVYHzaibzJ36fdkrBz-lF0hAcuL8l9F5bswPeO4lg)—SMPLverse maps the nonhuman identities conceived by machine learning. Though the secondary market may stage the traumatic return of the elective avatar repressed by the user’s biometric identity, it cannot mask the fact that the synthetic images are themselves proxies for seeing machines, which exceed and overcome the human binary of pseudonymity and identity.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/65U1_J5nnhymnckIKe9lu.jpeg?height=288&width=249)\n\nSMPLverse can be minted at [smplverse.xyz](https://smplverse.xyz/).

{"id": "DBVwUfKieaeUz07veqlz8laRaXZJQ5N501EZaIlx75k", "title": "What's a 'Good' Explanation?", "body": "## Look at your surroundings.\n\nNow, explain how you ended up here.\n\nDid your answer include the creation of existence, such as The Big Bang? If not, your answer is incomplete.\n\n### Existence\n\nDon’t be hard on yourself. Your explanation did not need to be 100% complete to suffice. This prompt is typically interpreted as a request for the most immediate and significant reasons for being here, such as: “I fell off my bike and broke my arm, so now I am in the ER”. For obvious reasons, it is impractical to describe The Big Bang and then every sequential moment that led to you falling off your bike. Nonetheless, let’s examine the reasons: (1) ain’t nobody got time for that. (2) any attempt at a complete explanation would be riddled with assumptions and inaccuracies. Nobody has observed every moment in spacetime, nor possesses the memory to remember, nor the processing capability to completely understand these events. The main point here is that there is a *reason for being* (not to be confused with purpose). The reason that ‘you’ exist is because your dad’s sperm fertilized your mom’s egg. Somewhere along the way, ‘you’ came into existence. However, the answer to the question “Why did you fall off your bike?” requires an infinitely precise answer in order to be 100% accurate (we obviously do not care about 100% accuracy in all cases, nor is 100% accuracy attainable). This is what we will explore in this post.\n\n### Elements of the Mind\n\nOkay, we do not care about The Big Bang when examining your current position in life. Instead, let’s view the most important part of reality -- your lifetime -- because everyone is the hero of their own story.\n\nLet’s begin at the moment in which “you” obtain consciousness\\* (ironically, a moment that nobody can remember). Upon accessing reality for the first time, “you” are immediately introduced to the **cause and effect protocol** of the universe, become aware of “your” existence (‘consciousness’), as well as develop an awareness of ‘thoughts’ and a procedure of thoughts (‘thinking’), achieve (some level of) control of your body and thinking (agency), and eventually learn from the environment (‘intelligence’, ‘cognition’, or as I like to say, ‘an ability to connect the dots’). In this case, the dots are bits of observed data (‘information’) interpreted as truth (‘knowledge’), which we store in our ‘memory’. The connections are a model that describes a functional i/o relation between bits (‘understanding’). Putting this all together, “we” exist as a conscious, intelligent agent of reality perceiving a sequence of moments (‘experience’) which we call life. It is almost as if reality is a Turing-Complete system (a BIG assumption) and our brains are a Turing Machine (another BIG assumption). The one thing missing in the Turing analogy is our ‘imagination’ -- the power to “see the unseen”. The reason that imagination is missing is because it is inconsistent with a Turing Machine, and thus makes humans extra interesting. The brain (our “interpretation engine”) is unique and not well understood. We are also skipping the sub-conscious element of this model for now … but will definitely discuss it later.\n\n### Trapped In The Present\n\nThe reason that we care about history is because we can learn things that may help us in the future. We start to learn the code of reality from personal observations. Then, we learn to communicate with others, trade ideas and inspiration with them, and trust their experiences and historical accounts of reality\\*\\**.* After all, we physically cannot observe *everything* ourselves. Your first conscious moment is different from my first moment, and our experiences may never overlap in any meaningful way (disregarding butterfly effects for now). We cannot recount the past with 100% certainty, especially events that we did not personally observe (and even when we do have an experience … our memory can still be fuzzy). In other words, you should keep the grain of salt in your lens. There are also complex mechanisms that influence our perception (such as assumptions, cognitive bias, motivation, feelings, emotions, and biology) of which we may not be aware in the moment (not to mention the physical limitations of our human senses). Perspective is gained with an account of bias. The famous motto from The Royal Society is pertinent here -- *Nullius in Verba* -- “take nobody’s word for it”.\n\n![A crude example of well-intentioned (perhaps) yet biased hearsay](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dSC4WSKaPSXEgp5J1L9A.png?height=1945&width=2085)\n\nA historical account is more reputable when there is evidence to corroborate it’s truth. The most influential evidence garners mass consensus of its implication (a flawed mechanism for finding truth … though it does provide a clue). There is a well known saying “wisdom of the crowd”. There is also a lesser known but equally as important saying “fatality of the mob”. Consensus provides a signal on social dynamics more than anything. The objective of consensus is to win a majority, which is all about compromise\\*\\*\\*, not truth-seeking. There is another common phrase, “history is written by the winners”, which is not an entirely true statement in its literal translation but is an attempt to describe the common biases in historical accounting. The history textbooks are missing many individual accounts, particularly on the loser’s side. This is not all the publisher’s fault because there are typically less of the losers around after a significant historical event like war, but the missing context makes the book sensitive to a combination of conformity, misattribution, and survivorship bias.\n\n![Infinitism  -- The Ultimate Burden Of Proof -- aka The Absence of Evidence vs. Evidence of Absence Fallacy](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd070309s.gif)\n\nEvidence is built through discovery -- a gain of information which improves our understanding of the circumstances which produced the evidence. It is still up to humans to deduce valid conclusions from discoveries. We commonly mistake evidence as proof. Circumstantial evidence does not have the power to prove on its own. Rather, it can indicate the likelihood of a particular events’ existence, but not accurately until we drop it into context. A proper investigation entails observing each piece of evidence from that instance of history (not as a “Bayesian” viewing that moment of history from the future) and then imagining the logical sequence of events (and eventually using the power of hindsight) to form dependencies, hence the phrase “drawing a conclusion”. Every historical account has a level of faith associated with it (and we usually realize overconfidence). For example, the discovery of fossils indicates the existence of large, now-extinct beings. And we can even imagine what they looked like! However, the fossils and present-day graphical renderings do not prove dinosaurs’ existence. The evidence simply gives us a level of confidence. A different explanation for the existence of fossils could be that a scientist synthesized fossil materials in a lab and buried them to eventually claim fame once he/she later “discovers” them and proposes a breakthrough theory of dinosaurs. However, there are sound reasons that easily disprove this explanation, namely, there is no evidence of a scientist or lab in 1677 (when Robert Plot found the first fossil) that had the capability to synthesize an organic material that could resemble the form of a fossil.\n\n![The Gettier Problem (philosophy), Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems (math), and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (science) all arrive at the same idea from different disciplines -- proof requires complete information and infinite precision. Conjecture is imminent (we settle for \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" in court.)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/proof.png)\n\nEvidence is an empirical starting point. It exists in context. A thorough assessment of evidence addresses as much context as possible to understand its implication. At the same time, there will always be missing context, so we will never have a totally complete or perfectly accurate history. I call this *The* *Theory of Relative History*.\n\n### Explanations\n\nI once concluded that everything can be explained, so the world must be deterministic. I arrived at this conclusion after reading *[The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359)* by David Deutsch. I highly recommend reading it. In fact, it was the inspiration for this blog (if you don’t read books, then at least listen to Naval Ravikant’s *[The Beginning of Infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0)* podcast series with Brett Hall breaking down the book). The big takeaway from the book is that omniscience is not required to have ‘creativity’ -- an ability to create new “things”. You do not need to know absolutely every fact that exists in order to understand everything that can be understood. Reality is most accurately described using good explanations, and there is an explanation for everything. The building blocks of explanations are **[First Principles](https://fs.blog/first-principles/#_ftn11)** -- namely the foundations of science (Relativity, Quantum, Evolution, Information, Computing, etc.) -- and the fuel is imagination.\n\n> *“What I cannot create, I do not understand”*\n>\n> \\-- Richard Feynman\n\nScience is an error-correcting machine. It disproves explanations and forms better ones. You will find that the most impactful explanations require intense imagination because they describe the *Unseen*:\n\n(1.) things that do not exist in the present moment and are of the past or future. For example, we can imagine hypotheticals.\n\n(2.) things which are not apparent to the senses, thus not observable. For example, we can measure the temperature of an atom’s nucleus, but we cannot observe the movement of quarks which are the cause (we think) of the temperature reading that we observe. Unobservable phenomena can be measured with special equipment, but we just observe the measurement readings on the equipment.\n\nAn explanation is not an explanation unless it is testable, falsifiable, and precisely answers “How?”. An explanation is our best guess. In this way, even good explanations are at risk of being inaccurate. This is okay because this is how we create new knowledge. A good explanation is our best understanding, our best description for how something works, why something happened, or why something will happen, at any given time. It is like the scientific method on steroids. A good explanation provides reasons and digs deep. It asks questions to get to the root. Try the **5 Why’s method** to improve the accuracy of an explanation.\n\n> *“Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.”*\n>\n> — Carl Sagan\n\nAs you can see from the bike example at the beginning, an explanation does not need to be entirely complete in order to be valuable because intelligent beings (humans) can identify patterns and make inferences. Again, a partially true, incomplete explanation can be sufficient if we only care about a certain level of accuracy. An explanation is measured by its explanatory power -- the degree to which an explanation accomplishes an objective. The objective can be (and usually is) to accurately describe or predict reality. Explanations have degrees of completeness based on the amount of information present in them\\*\\*\\*\\*. A thorough explanation leaves little to chance. A complete explanation leaves nothing to chance. The pinnacle of explanations is a perfect explanation -- 100% complete and 100% accurate. The ultimate explanation, a *Theory of Everything*, would be perfect. Many people have tried to find this explanation, such as Michio Kaku's *[The God Equation](https://www.amazon.com/God-Equation-Quest-Theory-Everything/dp/0385542747)* (I have not read yet), but none have succeeded.\n\nThe jury is still out on if a perfect explanation exists.\n\n### Truth\n\nOur initial guess for how knowledge exists is known as the ‘justified true belief’ theory of knowledge. This theory says that knowledge is about justifying your beliefs as true. It then goes on to say that if you accomplish this, then your belief is Truth (with a capital ‘T’). This a misconception because there is no logical way to prove any bit of knowledge as Truth (see [epistemic regress](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/knowledge/infinite_regress.html)). One can provide evidence, but this is not proof. If an explanation prevails against attempts to disprove it, then it is consistent with Truth and is probably considered useful. Yet, we can never know with 100% certainty that the explanation accurately describes a fundamental Truth (a “law” of nature\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*) because there is always a chance that we discover new information debunking that explanation. Then, we simply come up with a better explanation.\n\nThe first step to finding truth is to develop a theory of knowledge (epistemology). I subscribe to the theory that knowledge is an interpretation of information that is accepted as truth and can be measured for accuracy and significance. This implies knowledge is subjective i.e. your truth may not be my truth.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xwFu_2fyTN7kfq6Mi8bBH.png?height=792&width=1561)\n\nIn the end, knowledge is simply an iterative assumption. Humans seek highly objective knowledge because we get rewarded with better predictions. Nassim Taleb describes a concept of *non-observables*, in his *[Incerto](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Deluxe-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/198481981X)* (my favorite is *[The Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Impact-Improbable-Incerto/dp/1400063515/ref=asc_df_1400063515/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312106851030&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11165397501409576070&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010943&hvtargid=pla-330161967766&psc=1)*). There will always be unknowns and we do not know the significance of the unknowns. The highly significant non-observables are The Black Swans. We don't know for sure what will effect us, kill us, or save us. It may not be real today.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kWP9k4Mb0aJLmmm6JXgSD.png?height=697&width=1114)\n\nExplanations can retrospectively describe causation and also make reasonable predictions → which builds information and iterates knowledge → which inspires imagination → which creates explanations. These ‘creations’ bring a truth into existence that did not exist before (or at least did not exist to ‘you’). It is quite liberating when you realize that explanations are created with imagination, so in theory, you can understand anything! Regardless of whether or not information is infinite\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*, knowledge is not scarce. It is the product of intelligence and unbounded imagination and is stored in memory.\n\nKeep in mind, reality is unbiased. It is Truth. It just is\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is the purest form of objectivity (no interpretation necessary). Frankly, reality does not care about you (or anything). Reality is left to humans for interpretation. The most useful application of this realization is to practice acceptance because the world is not out to get you. At the same time, we are an agent of change capable of effecting our own lives. For every effect, there is a cause\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. For every output, there is an input. You may notice the continuity of this universal model. But what happens when there is a discontinuity in the model? And what does a gap represent?\n\n### Randomness\n\nThe answer is randomness -- uncertainty attributed to an absence of information. This is where we can assign probabilities rather than determinations of the future. The important thing here is that reality is not intrinsically random or uncertain … with one theoretical exception. The only proposed natural randomness in the universe is the phenomena described by quantum mechanics -- an explanation for how matter and energy behaves as spacetime approaches zero. Even in quantum, we have some predictive ability of the probability distribution of subatomic particles in spacetime. This gets more interesting if you consider quantum randomness in a multiplicative series of moments. As you can see, each sequential moment gets increasingly difficult to predict and eventually the complexity explodes, leading most scientists to chaos theory and the multiverse\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*.\n\nAll other probability is subject to a knowledge base. This means that any likelihood which we attributed to an event’s existence is a function of our ignorance. When humans say “I am uncertain”, we are admitting that we do not know a critical piece of information that would make the Truth apparent. We can reduce uncertainty and increase the accuracy of our predictions by reducing knowledge gaps (not to be confused with information gaps). Here are two ways to reduce knowledge gaps and improve predictability:\n\n1\\.) empirical methods -- inducing a hypothesis from experience.\n\n2\\.) explanatory methods -- deducing a cause and effect relation from imagination.\n\nThese methods are most powerful when deployed in tandem.\n\nEmpirical methods infer an independent factor (causal inference) from observations or experimental results (statistics). This is useful to identify information gaps. You can gain (uncover) information by changing the conditions (i.e. varying the independent variable to see the change in the dependent variable). Here’s a hint, when correlations between events approach 100%, you may getting closer to a causal relationship (though there still may be ‘Hidden’ variables\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* which are the actual root cause). However, correlation is not causation\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* …. so … how do you know if the measured response in the ‘effect variable’ was the result of varying the ‘cause variable’ or if the independent factors are truly independent themselves? Enter explanations.\n\nThis is how explanatory methods save the day. Explanations describe ‘the seen’ in terms of ‘the unseen’ -- information not represented in the statistics -- and can implicate an unknown factor as the root cause. The reasoning offered in an explanation is based in ‘possibility’ as opposed to ‘probability’ (though probability can also appear in an incomplete explanation). When something is deemed ‘unexplainable’, this indicates either a severe information gap or a lapse in imagination.\n\nI suggest watching Vsauce's YouTube video: \"[What is Random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0)\" and Veritasium’s sister episode: \"[What is Not Random](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE)\" to further explore randomness as a property of ignorance.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE)\n\nTo quickly make better predictions, acquire fundamental knowledge. Search for the fundamental factors of reality, the ones with high explanatory power. Lean on *First Principles* thinking or even better -- [Zeroth-Principles Thinking](https://medium.com/future-literacy/zeroth-principles-thinking-9376d0b7e7f5). After all, explanations are the best way to hunt the Truth. On the other hand, we will always have to make decisions with incomplete information, and thus are exposed to uncertainty … so get used to it!\n\nI glossed over the fact that “meaning” is an important part of the brain’s interpretation engine. Sooo … what is meaning? Is meaning created or intrinsic to reality? If we assume that reality is deterministic, then can meaning exist or can we have free will? Can there be a meaning of life? If we assume that life has meaning, then what is the meaning? My best answer right now: the meaning of life is to create value. More on that in the next post…\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*I assume ownership of consciousness for the sake of understanding; rather, consciousness spontaneously “exists” without an agent or precise initial moment and is “you”. I enjoyed Brett Hall’s view of [ontology](https://www.bretthall.org/blog) --an explanation of being--what does it mean to exist. The model that I describe requires a definition for the concept of “you” (a whole exercise itself). I use a version of “you” that is a figment of the brain and represents an identity. “You” is awareness that exists as a state of consciousness. I also enjoyed Evan Conrad’s [article](https://evanjconrad.com/posts/how-to-feel-good) which offers a view that “you” are not your “thoughts” and suggests practical applications of this knowledge. “You” observe thoughts. At the same time, you have agency of thinking in the sense that you may be aware of a thought or feelings and its relation to “you” (as an identity that has control of an interpretation engine which does thinking procedures and serves the next thought). I would like to add that you are not your feelings. In Conrad’s view, both thoughts and feelings are real “to” you, rather than “are” or “of” you.\n\n\\*\\*Yes, trust in fellow humans is risky, but the payoffs have historically outweighed the costs. There are concepts of infinite games in Game Theory which incentivize cooperation in most instances.\n\n\\*\\*\\*We will explore the mechanisms of consensus in another post.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*Completeness is a function of access and precision. Explanations are incomplete when they are missing info. This is almost always the case when expressing explanations in spoken language because language itself is imprecise. A good question: can we know all information?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* When describing physical reality, there is no such thing as a “law of nature” or Truth (with a capital ‘T’) since the description exists in the abstract realm of knowledge. There are just REALLY good explanations (called theories in science) that may resemble physical Truth because of their accuracy in describing and predicting phenomena, but we would never know for certain. However, there is a Truth. It exists and exists as reality. This implies the existence of False (with a capital ‘F’). Knowledge is abstract thought -- an interpretation of information which exists relative to reality (Truth/False) -- and can actually be True or False when describing knowledge, but not reality.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*The more important and deeper question is whether reality is continuous or discrete. This question is most famously illustrated via [Zeno’s Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes). Modern science does not even have a consensus on this answer. I think the answer requires a better understanding of time and information. Is information a property of reality? Does reality exist as a state of information at (that changes changes between?) moments of time? Can we create new “things” (real or abstract)? Does the set of information (as elements) grow, accumulate, remain static, or simply change?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*I suppose the ultimate truth is whether reality itself exists or not.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*We may explore whether the inverse is necessarily true, which requires a consideration of infinity. What happens when you consider time (the temporal relationship between cause and effect)? The most convincing concept of time that I can understand is that time represents a relation between moments of reality. In this concept, a moment is a state of information (reality) and time is the relation of moments -- The God Equation -- rather than the moment. Therefore, there are instances of information, rather than instances of time. Time describes change. It *is* change. If time is a relation mapping a state of info to another state of info, which [type](https://t-redactyl.io/blog/2021/03/types-of-functions-injective-surjective-and-bijective.html) of relation is it?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*We may address these concepts at some point. We perceive time as a sequence of moments (maybe a series when considering our memory), but time may not actually “be” an ordered sequence of moments. We do not have access to all of reality (information), which leads to gaps in information and knowledge (understanding). Also, knowledge lags information. The Truth Spectrum is not to be confused with true vs. false in logic. It is more closely related to the concept of [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) in Information Theory.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Any statistical model can attempt to predict reality. Some models are capable of making accurate predictions (though maybe not significant). Yet, any model trying to predict reality assumes a complete and closed system. We can use a model to make inferences about things not in the data, but non-observables belong to the realm of possibility (unknown unknowns), not probability (known unknowns). A change in the dependent variable (effect) may be caused by an unaccounted or unknown factor (cause) rather than the independent factor. This may be “confounding'“ to some. Others say Hidden variables, once identified in an experiment, are “extraneous” if they think they can be controlled. It is hard to control variables (especially unknown ones) in experiments, and physical experiments are temporal in nature.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Correlation is an association between sets, not a function. Causality is a function of sorts.\n\nPS: I promise future blogs will not be this long.", "timestamp": 1658163527, "digest": "XBF7e-KI2SNCYCGSqRaK059TbHOrbIfgP2crB0wfjmA", "contributor": "0x8FA9E69BA39A209e6D105c6ccfd82e7c2c5Af28f"}

{"id": "DSfRFLK9JEle7r5ZHCaaFP7jemw7w-7qdkuCz1dwKH8", "title": "One of the 20%", "body": "Yesterday morning, I was bright-eyed bushy-tailed; and prepared with a list of topics that I wanted to discuss for my weekly 1:1 with my manager. As I hopped on and landed on the waiting screen, I saw my manager and Devin on the call. I knew something was up but I joined with a smile. My smile immediately fell flat within seconds as I saw the distressed look on Devin’s face. I knew he was going to deliver some hard news to me and he did.\n\n[I became one of the 20% who was let go.](https://fortune.com/2022/07/14/opensea-nft-marketplace-layoff-crypto-winter/)  After the news, I was utterly dumbfounded and numbed, but I took the news lightly as I understood they had to do what was important for the business and the state of the market.  An hour later, I received the most thoughtful message from Alex and I burst into extreme tears; and memories of my time at OpenSea flashed before my eyes.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BLhihGLpO3r03LC6Km3lS.png?height=381&width=505)\n\nWaves of emotions filled my mind and my heart — from feeling appreciated, confused, sorrowful, angry, yet a bit relieved.\n\nMy journey at OpenSea is rooted quite deep and started with a hackathon back in February 2018. Alex, Devin, Dylan, Elena and a few others started a project called [Ethmoji](https://ethmoji.io/), where you can build your own Ethmoji and customize your own eyes, nose, mouth, and hair. The special thing about this project is that all the owners of each attribute used in the composition can earn royalties. This was the birth of PFP collections.\n\nAfter this hackathon, Alex and Devin invited me to join OpenSea to build an eBay for digital assets as their founding designer. I declined as I was cautious of early-stage startups after being the founding designer at Zugata (acq by [Culture Amp](https://www.cultureamp.com/)). Also, I was really skeptical about the space and didn’t quite understand why people were buying and [selling digital cats](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) online.\n\n![Counter-clockwise: Jessica Phan, Alex Atallah, Devin Finzer, Dylan Field, and Elena Nadolinski. Photo taken by my beloved husband who has always supported every project.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5MkwMsGW7xq8gdOBVHfRx.jpg?height=960&width=720)\n\nHowever, marketplaces are my bread and butter and I’ve always loved working with Alex, so I decided to work part-time with OpenSea. At the same time, I was off on my own venture — [traveling the world](http://jessica.is/a-hodophile/), consulting with other companies, while building my very own called [Hathorway](https://hathorway.com/).\n\nIn the Fall of 2020, Devin asked if I would be interested in joining full-time and leading Product and Design at OpenSea. It was such an exciting opportunity and a big role, but I had declined once again because I just created a new company with a friend after becoming a new mother, called [Ritual Meals](https://ritualmeals.com/) and I wanted to see this through.\n\nOnce 2021 rolled in, NFTs started blowing up and OpenSea raised their Series A of $23m, everything changed. And I realized the food industry is a cut-throat business, I left Ritual Meals and placed all my bets on OpenSea. Once I joined, I partnered really closely with [Nate Chastain](https://twitter.com/natechastain), who is one of my favorite people to work with despite the [insider trading fiasco](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-employee-nft-marketplace-charged-first-ever-digital-asset-insider-trading-scheme). Together, we cranked and cranked features along with many talented engineers, and watched the bars in volume rise month to month.\n\nDuring my time here, I had many first. I was the first 10 employees, the first designer, the first woman, and the first mother. I  designed the first several versions of [OpenSea.io](https://opensea.io/), [the blog](https://opensea.io/blog), [the logo](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/56143034414220578210570473379568418089845102446433003880655728973961440002049), [the first mobile app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKt59kExL-o),  [the first OpenSea and NFT explainer video](https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1446492795066372099) with [Thinkmojo](https://www.thinkmojo.com/), coined the phrase “the world's first and largest NFT marketplace”, and built out a killer design team, healthy design culture, and well-oiled process that I am proud of.\n\nYesterday was the end of this journey for me. In a way, it felt as if I have carried and given birth to a child, only to have it taken away from me. But I realized that OpenSea is not a child anymore, it has grown up and left the house. And it’s time for me to let go and move on.\n\nFor the other 20% that were laid off, thank you for putting so much heart and soul into what you do — for building OpenSea for what it is today and laying out the foundations of the NFT space from the product, community, and team. Wipe those tears, brush any discouragement and doubts, and be so proud of what we’ve accomplished together.\n\nFor those who remain at OpenSea, my only ask is “don’t fuck it up” — for the sake of those that fall in 20%.  I know you will do an amazing job evolving it, so take good care with OpenSea. LFG.\n\nAnd yes, once again, [jessica is unemployed](http://jessica.is/unemployed/). While I’m still deciding what my next venture will be, I will be taking a little break — perhaps [make some jewelry](https://hathorway.com/), [draw a little](http://jessica.is/animal-letters/), [write a little](https://www.fastcompany.com/3055836/how-feng-shui-could-help-build-better-products), and finally, be able to be present with family.\n\nIf you like to connect, you can reach me via twitter [@ohjphan](https://twitter.com/ohjphan)", "timestamp": 1658165884, "digest": "3EMlnj-jRPeOt_GpScJqKoa0OQDnRafVrLjCOj6O6vc", "contributor": "0x7c1fD4d5aCc15b46729c5Fb9279B49Cf71178654"}

Scratch that…! I have always been a skeptic. This is because I find myself constantly weighing up my options in terms of logical premises, and lets be honest, sometimes, you just have to go with your gut! But even so, when I began surveying the basic principles that govern this new model of the internet aka “web3”, I found myself at loggerheads once more battling between the emotional highs of what others are doing, and what makes more sense!\n\nRight now, there’s a plethora of information being posited into every available market and it can become quite overwhelming. So many people in the web3 space often DM me asking me how many NFT’s I own (and we will get to this momentarily), and the majority of those conversations revolve around NFTs, -as in NFT art- yet this minuscule piece isn’t about Punks or BAYC (Yup, Shoot me! I’m behaving like a like an NFT heretic).\n\n### Of NFTs & NFT Domains\n\nWhilst NFT art is definitely the conduit that created a real buzz around the world, most people within the space are completely oblivious to the fact that **NFT art is merely one block in an endless chain of possibilities with regards to non-fungible tokens**. Coming back to the common question that most NFT art holders lean with, it usually commences by the question, “*So? How many NFT’s do you own?”* and my response is, “*Over 1000*”. This is usually met with a request of images as proof, or followed by the question of “*Which collection?*” \n\nHowever, what majority of these inquisitors fail to realize is that **every domain from *Unstoppable Domains i*s an NFT** and the use-cases from ‘owning’ them are far too enticing to pass up that opportunity. \n\nThink about it…right now, even though you may be accessing this NFT article from a web2 browser, in time to come, there will be web3 decentralized sites set up that will give the member direct access, and as a corollary, phasing out the web2 sites. And in that inevitable case, it is not NFT art, or metaverse land that will become the most sought after commodity of web3, but NFT domains, without which, web3 will remain a pipe dream, because inasmuch as it will be constantly referred to, without NFT domains, the websites will still be web2-based, and that is a reality that web3 idealists will not support in the long term.\n\nIt is therefore, a highly sound deduction that NFT domains will ‘direct’ the keyboards of every web3 enthusiast in time to come just as how .coms, .orgs etc. were the craze when the legacy internet was being set up. Those who have understood this, and have been piling up on the NFT domains will, in all probability -like their predecessors- come out as the overall winners in the space. \n\nHowever, there are some challenges when making the correct choice, and this is where my personal experience guided me, to what I believe, will be the next top CNS (crypto naming service) for web3., viz. *Unstoppable Domains*.\n\n### The Tipping Points\n\nWhen I first got into the space (mind you only in November 2021), I had engaged in an exhaustive deep dive juxtaposing the pros and cons and then revisiting some of the legacy domain policies. I was just swallowing up information like a vacuum cleaner on steroids.. And by the end of this feeding frenzy, my decision was based on the following *tipping points* that simply nudged me in the correct direction. They were;\n\na) Ownership\n\nb) Cost\n\nc) Immediate Utility\n\n### To Own or Not to Own, This is the Question?\n\nThe web3 space is all about the ‘*ownership economy*’ and it is indeed the fundamentally attractive point for both investors and the general populace. However, during my research into the web3 naming services, I found myself at a cul-de-sac of confusion as many of these naming services were still modelled on the previous web2 modus operandi regarding custodianship.\n\n For instance, *ENS Domains* is excelling in secondary sales, which is undoubtedly an attractive point when choosing where to invest, and a reason that causes one to become emotional when deciding, but the question of whether they are absolutely immutable in terms of ‘ownership’ is a matter of great debate because like the legacy root before, domains are held in the custody of the registrar, and as a result, the owner risks loss of the domain by means of expiration date or failure to pay renewal fees. By this measure, ENS Domains did not meet the criteria -according to my understanding of the ‘ownership economy’-, and was a vital reason why I did not opt to invest in large amounts of .eth domains. \n\n*Unstoppable Domains* on the other hand, presented a more web3-ish option as the domains are stored in the custody of the purchaser to the point that even if UD wanted the domain back, they would require action from the purchaser to transfer it into their custody. The reason why this particular aspect was a tipping point in the direction of Unstoppable Domains was simply because, if I could not take custody of the NFT domain as my digital asset in my own wallet under my rules, then technically I never owned it at all, and if I never owned it at all, then it pretty much felt like a web2 version with some web3 face painting, and that was something that did not sit well with me. \n\nNow I am certain that the ENS maxis out there will disagree, and they are entitled to their opinions, but until I can be convinced of true ownership, knowing that if I went into a sudden coma, and awoke 10 years later, that my domain would not have been snatched away from me as a corollary of not being in my full custody, then that is a product I am not 100% sure of its claim to be within the ‘ownership economy’ -in my view anyway.\n\nFor instance, I currently own ‘*whistleblowers.x*’ and in terms of the concept of secrecy and discretion in the very nature of whistleblowing, this can only work if it is decentralized and out of the crutches of those who wish to push their political agendas. Now, if I owned ‘whistleblowers.eth’ and established trust from various whistleblowers out there to freely communicate their information or crypto payments discreetly…and if I missed the renewal date due to some unforeseen circumstance, then I could risk their safety as whistleblowers to disastrous effect. Thus, true ownership in this ‘domain’ is the factor that tipped me straight into the warm embrace of UD are they give me autonomy over the domain, and that my dear friends, is how I envisage web3. Don’t you?\n\n### Costing\n\nAgain, I found myself at loggerheads when ENS Domains kept coming up in my searches, and I was quite impressed that ENS does not have any price structure that causes you to spend hundreds of thousands on a domain. This is a bonus on anybody’s radar. What I did not know was that gas fees could be much more than the domain itself at times, and those who were much more experienced had been utilizing specialized tools to determine the best possible times when gas fees were low. I, on the other hand did not have that luxury, and found it a stumbling block that in addition to the initial gas fees, at every renewal process, I would be required to pay for gas. Some may argue that the gas fee issue is mitigated by purchasing the domain for 5 years as an example, but if I want to flip domains for quick cash then this option isn’t ideal at all. Sure, it may suit those who have deep pockets, or those looking to HODL for the long term, but even then, if you hold 300 domains and each one requires renewal, there is a high probability of missing out on some of them -and .com users know all too well about that. \n\nWith *Unstoppable Domains*, there is a once-off fee. You can get a domain for as little at $5 as a random pseudonymous wallet address, of even something like *jedigamer123.nft* for $5 (still available by the way) and never have to concern yourself with renewal fees, or expiration of the domain…ever! Once it is secured by your crypto wallet, you are the official ‘owner’ of that NFT domain. \n\nThe average price of the .nft is approximately $20, the .crypto around $40 and the .x is $100. The algorithm prices the more premium domains at a much higher rate and can range from anything between $20-$250k or more perhaps. When you are selling something completely, then you can understand the price hike for domains that are of higher demand. For instance, no sane person in the space would expect to pay $20 for ‘business.crypto’ as that is a much sought after key word with endless possibilities. Incidentally, it belonged to @DiaryNoori (someone I can call my friend) and it sold on Opensea for $120k this year. \n\nIn terms of cost, I prefer to pay for something once-off and know that it is mine to own, having never to concern myself thereafter with any kind of pricing that may jeopardize my domain in the case of any unforeseen circumstances or negligence on my part. This is my preference, and for those who are fine with having to continuously check their domains for expiration dates and to budget for that, then ‘to each their own’, even if the incessantly laborious is what tickles your fancy. \n\n### Immediate Utility\n\nInsofar as utility is concerned, we are still relatively early in the web3 space and whilst this is good, it does not mean that there shouldn’t be immediate utility. There are a lot of naming services out there popping up like mushrooms after the rains, but many of them are just charging for domains that cannot be utilized at the base level for buying or selling crypto, let alone a market place to flip them. ENS and Unstoppable Domains are leading the way currently by providing utility in many ways, even at this early stage. The tipping point for me once again was the fact that Unstoppable Domains currently offers 10 extensions instead of one, so I could choose, -based on the name I was purchasing- whether or not a particular extension suited the ideals of that which was envisaged for the domain. For instance, if I wanted to have a domain with view to building an NFT project later on, I just couldn’t see it with a .eth extension that could be self explanatory to anyone who saw the project. So was I to add \\*\\*\\*\\*nft.eth? Or just get a .nft? the latter was always going to make more sense.\n\nAdditionally, Unstoppable Domains prides itself in not just supplying names, but providing use-cases for the domains that will allow the holder’s on-chain identity to travel with them wherever they travel in the world of web3. I will attempt to write a little piece later on regarding the utility of UD’s NFT Domains, but for beginners struggling to make these decisions, I have found the variety at UD to be far more attractive, albeit unlike Handshake, that offers limitless TLDs, Unstoppable Domains has created a culmination of some of the most relevant extensions that are self-explanatory within the space and extensions that will become common lingo!\n\n**Conclusion** - My choice to go all-in on Unstoppable Domains comes from a place that is predicated on logic because so many aspects about their mission  and product just makes sense in retrospect of the web3 vision that we all hope to see some day. Yes, many may assume this material to be biased, but as a holder of ENS domains and Handhsake domains too, my views are based on my experience. I believe that web3 is big enough for everyone to survive and I cannot see a future of web3 that does not include Unstoppable Domains as a leading naming service. With over 2.5 million registrations in the bag and hundreds of partnerships with crypto companies, Unstoppable Domains is going to be a force to be reckoned with, and I am proud to wear the badge of a UDwhale!\n\n**Acknowledgement:** It would be criminal not to mention some of the great people along the way that guided me in my journey to becoming a whale investor, people who I am eternally thankful to, and who are part of the ever growing UDfam…they are (by twitter handle):\n\n@dontgetdashed\n\n@PopDomains\n\n@CaptainBitcoinx\n\n@Ohh_Mr_Silver\n\n@theweb3god\n\n@tipstapunk\n\nThanks Guys!

土地>门票>明信片。\n\n2\\.蓝色紫色橙色入门小地块值得购买，建议想要参与游戏的玩家尽量早入手基础土地，如果是投资的话，建议在二级市场密切关注橙色及以上稀有度的地块。\n\n3\\.门票可以等活动抢一下试试，预计还有 1\\~2 次出售活动， 目前黄金门票已溢价十倍， 银和玉门票价格稳中看涨。\n\n4\\.明信片是限量套装，但是官方没有进一步的消息，价格目前稳定，不建议投资，自用的话可以考虑买入，价格还是比较合理的，有上涨空间，但不如土地和门票实用。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F8mq-GBuRD1Q5HrHbmdHtK.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n##

等公司招募了一支由游戏行业资深人士组成的全明星团队。团队成员曾为众多知名游戏Fortnite、战神、使命召唤和守望先锋等做开发或运营。\n\n《BigTime》的CEO是Ari Meilich，此前为Decentraland的创始人；艺术指导是《魔兽世界》的视觉原画设计Carlo Arellano，首席概念艺术家为《英雄联盟》场景原画概念艺术家Tom Zhao；豪华的游戏开发团队用自研专利的 Vault 技术来搭建游戏内的交易架构。\n\n## 投资团队\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fz1lDYQraPEFGvNzrakplc.png&w=1200&q=90)\n\n去年五月份Big Time Studios获得包括FBG Capital、North Island Ventures、Digital Currency Group、OKEx Blockdream Ventures、Alameda Research、Circle Financial以及Sound Ventures领投的1030万美元在内的2100万美元的A轮融资。另外获得的1100万美元基金将用于投资采用Big

硬核观点\n\n1\\.顶级开发团队与雄厚资金支持，切入的角度与目前市面上大部分游戏多为不同，注重游戏体验、提高公平性，这才是游戏本来该有的样子。\n\n2\\.BigTime将不会有代币私募，游戏不会向任何人（包括开发团队）提供代币的首次发行或预售，代币将100%由社区驱动。可以感受到big time完全不一样的游戏格局，这是我非常看好的一点。\n\n3\\.区别于现在碎片化的游戏（或者说是矿游图片），big time更类似目前传统的游戏，耗时长，需要玩法精，策略多，配合上游戏经济代币模型+多种类NFT，对于玩家有一定门槛，也提高了游戏的耐玩度和激励刺激度。\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FThqXHLuD4hQNpHOeu3NGF.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n以上！\n\n\\--------------\n\n用硬核的态度面对不（fei）确（chang）定（c

{"id": "wtBF_pEhSCQFZ-Ig0urk5T9sJl5nm35_ODlFDhgwCQ0", "title": "Presenting the Revert Compoundor", "body": "We’re excited about releasing a new feature today for Uniswap v3 Liquidity Providers: **fee auto-compounding.**\n\nWe think this will be useful for LPs depending on how long they plan to hold positions and what they expect their **Fee APR** to be going forward.\n\nIn Uniswap v3 compounding of fees does not occur automatically, as it does on its predecessor, and manual compounding of fees requires doing a few different contract interactions and calculations to:\n\n1. Collect fees via the Uniswap NFT Manager contract.\n2. Possibly check the amounts of token0 and token1 required to swap so as to maximize the amount of liquidity added to the position.\n3. Possibly perform the required swap.\n4. Add the tokens as liquidity to the position.\n\nAdditionally because fees do not grow at a constant rate, and the cost of compounding is a multiple of the gas price, to compound optimally requires constant monitoring of a position.\n\nBecause gas prices determine the cost of compounding, the deployment of Uniswap v3 on low gas price chains means that a much larger proportion of positions would be optimally compounded a much greater number of times that on mainnet.\n\nTo automate the above process we are releasing a simple protocol: Revert Compoundor.\n\nPositions managed by the Compoundor contract can be auto-compounded by anyone. The ***autoCompound*** function takes any uncollected fees for a position, optionally swaps them to a determined ratio given the position range and the current pool price, and adds it as liquidity to the position.\n\nA small fraction of the *collected-and-compounded* fees are paid to the protocol and to compensate the accounts call the auto-compound function for their gas costs incurred. This performance fee is set to 2% on launch and by design can only be decreased, never increased.\n\nAdditionally once a position is added to the Compoundor protocol contract, the position owner is able to conveniently execute the ***autoCompound*** function at any time, in which case there are no fees charged aside from the regular gas costs of executing the call.\n\nWe are publishing a draft of a [whitepaper](https://hackmd.io/@revert/BJcGIJQ35) that explains how the protocol works and how we are estimating the expected benefits of auto-compounding for any position.\n\nAdditionally the protocol contracts have had an open bug bounty on Immunefi since June 14th.\n\n[https://github.com/revert-finance/compoundor](https://github.com/revert-finance/compoundor)\n\n[https://immunefi.com/bounty/revert/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/revert/)\n\nTo give it a try just visit your positions dashboard, and for any v3 position you will see a “Compound Fees” button at the bottom, by clicking on it a panel will expand that will show you the estimated benefits of auto-compounding your position given the current fee APRs.\n\n![A hypothetical position that would benefit from auto-compounding](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RX4uGBzjUqUTnU-xEDLm1.png?height=1524&width=1098)\n\nThe total yearly improvement, and the time to break-even, will depend on each positions’ performance. Depending on each LPs strategy and expectations, auto-compounding might not be ideal. Particularly on high gas-price environments like Ethereum mainnet, auto-compounding should be attractive mostly to LPs with very high fee apr, or long expected time range on their positions.\n\nWe are also excited about launching this protocol/feature today simultaneously on [Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code), [Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code), [Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code), and [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code).\n\nSo we hope you try it out, check if it makes sense for your current or future Uniswap v3 positions, and if you have any questions or comments, drop by our discord.", "timestamp": 1658167216, "digest": "Uz-aJ5PYYmcCp-d-fJm7d4pVowI0XKKBZF0ZN3LtSKM", "contributor": "0x8cadb20A4811f363Dadb863A190708bEd26245F8"}

CryptoPunks 是第一个 NFT 化身，而Hashmasks引发了最近的炒作。归根结底，Bored Ape Yacht Club 是那些让事情变得更加主流的俱乐部，加入了 Alexis Ohanian、Mike Shinoda 和 Stephen Curry 等名人。我们希望看到**在游戏世界中扩展我们的 NFT**，这就是这些 NFT 头像项目发挥作用的地方。\n\n>

RTFKT （[ETH上惊艳你我的NFT项目抢先看](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDc0MzI4Mw==&mid=2648746012&idx=1&sn=7be836edfee261a1b6762134442cf506&chksm=be5427808923ae96af42f28d079b38bbe9bc1360a7b26124e06cd46cbdc21b5d88c85f5e6776&scene=21#wechat_redirect)）的设计表中出现了 Clone X，这是一个与各种实用程序一起启动的化身项目。那些能够声称或购买 Clone X 角色 NFT 的人，也将在更广泛的元宇宙中获得实用性。20000 个 NFT 化身中的每一个都将是完全 3D、自定义建模的，可以在各种虚拟世界中使用。细节尚未最终确定，但从 RTFKT 与 Decentraland 的历史以及 Somnium Space 的完整头像支持来看，我们可以填补这些点。当然，VR Chat、Webaverse 和其他虚拟环境也可以使用。Clone X 还没有出现，但这是一个值得关注的项目。\n\n**官网：clonex.rtfkt.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FJyqGs-NOJjN0FPmiPpA_Q.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**无聊猿俱乐部**\n\n当下最受关注的 NFT 项目之一是 Bored Ape Yacht Club。拥有一只无聊的猿让你成为一个由创新者和投资者组成的包容性社区的一部分。但是我们没有听说在现实世界中穿 Bored Ape 毛衣，因为我们正在寻找那些游戏机会。BAYC 最近公布了他们的无聊猿和突变猿的路线图，你猜怎么着？每个 NFT 持有者都会有 3D 模型，The Sandbox 中会有一个 BAYC VX Apes 世界，一个团队正在开发一款绝密的区块链游戏。现在，无聊猿是进入社区的入口，很快这些将成为虚拟环境中的代表。\n\n**官网：boredapeyachtclub.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FC1HpPM0TFRpV_R0GgnJiG.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Voxies**\n\n我们以前写过关于 Voxies 的文章，这并非没有道理。这些体素角色可能看起来像 The Sandbox 中的美眉，但这是不正确的。Voxies 是可收藏的 NFT，可以用作您的个人资料图片。然而，查看它们的元数据并了解它们在游戏中的表现更为重要。因为 Voxies 将成为即将到来的游戏 Voxie Tactics 中的游戏角色。在战术回合制 RPG 中，玩家使用他们的 Voxies 与敌人作战并智取对手。良好的定位和战术执行将使球员和他们的 Voxies 为胜利做好准备。Voxies NFT 头像总是应该成为更大游戏产品的一部分。\n\n**官网：voxies.io**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fqu6KtGVOUYzQXO3-sltku.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**绒毛世界**\n\nFluf World 是一个由 10000 个 NFT 组成的集合，已经在雷达下航行了很长一段时间，直到它们得到了 Outlier Ventures 的支持。这些 NFT 化身将音乐与其视觉设计相结合。难怪 Fluf World NFT 将成为实体和虚拟音乐会、节日和体验的门票。NFT 所有者可以很快下载他们的 3D 模型，为支持虚拟环境的用户做好准备。此外，Flufs 将获得 AI，将拥有自己的虚拟世界，并且他们将获得自己的代币：Mycelium。育种是 Fluf World 游戏赚钱经济的第一步，但事情不会就此止步。角色所有者也对 NFT 拥有完全的商业权利，从而为新的业务关系打开了生态系统。\n\n**官网：fluf.world**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F_v5183LNcalovVk-KkILq.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Vox**\n\nGala Games 一直致力于开发各种游戏，包括 Town Star 和 Mirandus。此外，他们还有各种第三方开发人员正在开发，例如 Spider Tanks 和 Echoes of Empire。但是，我们在这里谈论 Vox。这些体素角色拥有自己的虚拟世界，目前仅用于社交。每个 Vox NFT 都有自己的外观、工作和个性。拥有 NFT 后，用户还可以访问 FBX 文件，从而允许在其他世界中进行集成。将 Vox NFT 化身放入 Town Star 将在游戏时生成 TOWN 代币，同时也增加了一些 DeFi 收益农场实用程序。\n\n**官网：collectvox.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FObbAJAWvjxqHP_Ap2-edy.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Aavegotchi**\n\n虽然每个人都在谈论将代币添加到 NFT 集合中，但 Aavegotchi 已经这样做了将近一年。他们的像素幽灵装满了代币，穿着有价值的 NFT 衣服，并在 Rarity Farming 活动中生成 GHST。为了增加项目的复杂性，该团队现在在 Gotchiverse 上工作。这个虚拟世界将允许 NFT 所有者使用他们的 Gotchi 化身进行游戏。最终，这些被动像素化钱包现在将成为大型多人在线角色扮演游戏中的虚拟角色。\n\n**官网：aavegotchi.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FLLDNheDCc5Gsgvxr7H-Z-.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Habbo Avatars**\n\n二十年前，Habbo Hotel 通过创建一个让许多青少年相互联系的社交虚拟空间，成为先驱者之一。二十年后的今天，他们推出了 Habbo Avatars，这是一种独特的 NFT 化身，将在 Habbo 的虚拟世界中可用。此外，NFT 所有者将有资格获得奖励、空投和特殊活动。这些是今年的计划。Habbo 想进军赚钱的领域。开发人员希望将游戏赚钱机制整合到 Habbo 和 Hotel Hideaway 中，因此我们可以期待在 2022 年为早期的 Habbo Avatar 支持者提供更多实用性。Habbo Avatars 显然使用 NFT 化身将他们的游戏世界向新经济开放。\n\n**官网：nft.habbo.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FAZoQYzVh_-iiLMimVdPht.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Metakrew**\n\nMetakrew 是 9750 个随机生成的 NFT 化身，在元宇宙中具有直接实用性。该项目将于 11 月启动，并且还将具有一些许可品牌特征。每个 2D 化身都带有从相同元数据生成的 3D 角色。这些 3D Metakrew 角色将与即将于 2022 年发布的首个游戏兼容。此外，这些角色将与其他虚拟世界兼容。明年，由 Matty aka DCLBlogger 领导的团队也将启动一个宠物项目。\n\n**官网：themetakey.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fw789A-x82RGuuxSZIwnM5.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Hashmasks**\n\n2021 年初，Hashmasks 作为一个新的 NFT 艺术项目推出，并由于炒作迅速登上了头条。可以说，这是我们仍在经历的 NFT 化身炒作周期的开始。8 月，Hashmasks 团队宣布将该项目转移到游戏和虚拟世界中。该团队将委托开发一款视频游戏，该游戏使用原始艺术品或基于 NFT 艺术品空投的 NFT 化身。尽管尚未透露有关该游戏的更多详细信息（可能甚至还没有真正开始开发），但开发人员确实注意到它将具有游戏赚钱机制。\n\n**官网：thehashmasks.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FkGHdzsjju6yxZ_ICwTobv.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Meebits**\n\n2021 年 5 月，每位 CryptoPunk 所有者都获得了免费的 Meebit NFT，而其他人则可以通过 2.5 ETH 的荷兰拍卖获得 Meebit。尽管 Meebits 有点被遗忘了，但 Larva Labs 的 NFT 集合确实引入了一个特殊功能：作为虚拟世界中的 3D 头像的实用程序。NFT 所有者可以使用 OBJ 文件将他们的 Meebit 导入到 VR 聊天、Somnium Space 或其他 VR 环境中。作为最早的 3D 化身之一，或者可以说是第一个，Meebits 确实具有一定的历史意义。现在想象一下，你可以使用 Meebit 来玩任何游戏。这很酷！\n\n**官网：meebits.larvalabs.com**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FhJeyLhP7CW0nha9JtRHzL.png&w=640&q=90)\n\n**Deadfellaz**\n\nDeadfellaz 是 NFT 的卡通僵尸合集，在社区中引起了不小的关注。事实上，Elijah “Frodo” Wood 是他们社区的一部分。该团队目前正在制定其路线图的 2.0 版本，但他们已经宣布每个 Deadfellaz NFT 都可以访问 ta 3D 操纵的化身角色。然后，他们将能够在各种虚拟世界中使用这些文件，从 VR 聊天到 Zoom 会议，从 Webaverse 到 Somnium Space。该团队将在万圣节前后在 Decentraland 开设自己的区域，并将其命名为 Deadzone 13。\n\n**官网：www.deadfellaz.io**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fz_3uClYepMTboJ7bbKXQR.png&w=1200&q=90)\n\n**Visitors of Imma Degen (VOID)**\n\n虽然许多化身项目后来推出了他们的 3D 化身，但 Imma Degen 的访客从一开始就玩了这个游戏。这些 Imma Degen 的访问者或简单的 VOID NFT 都已准备好在虚拟世界中使用。所有者对其角色拥有完全的商业权利。NFT 所有者可以在 Somnium Space 中使用他们的角色，社区也有自己的聚会地点。NFT VOID 虚拟形象真的是为游戏而生的，尤其是用于修改现有游戏。是的，您可以使用自己的 VOID 角色在 Grand Theft Auto 中四处奔跑！该团队还推出了 WynLambo，这是一种与 VOID 配套的类似宠物的 NFT，同时他们现在正在扩展 VOID 2.0 的路线图。\n\n**官网：immadegen.com**\n\n>

{"id": "a_GAMNpZPIpDngz24sJ33dZqXMZnE6Q5tA-obX1SyLA", "title": "Presenting the Revert Compoundor", "body": "We’re excited about releasing a new feature today for Uniswap v3 Liquidity Providers: **fee auto-compounding.**\n\nWe think this will be useful for LPs depending on how long they plan to hold positions and what they expect their **Fee APR** to be going forward.\n\nIn Uniswap v3 compounding of fees does not occur automatically, as it does on its predecessor, and manual compounding of fees requires doing a few different contract interactions and calculations to:\n\n1. Collect fees via the Uniswap NFT Manager contract.\n2. Possibly check the amounts of token0 and token1 required to swap so as to maximize the amount of liquidity added to the position.\n3. Possibly perform the required swap.\n4. Add the tokens as liquidity to the position.\n\nAdditionally because fees do not grow at a constant rate, and the cost of compounding is a multiple of the gas price, to compound optimally requires constant monitoring of a position.\n\nBecause gas prices determine the cost of compounding, the deployment of Uniswap v3 on low gas price chains means that a much larger proportion of positions would be optimally compounded a much greater number of times that on mainnet.\n\nTo automate the above process we are releasing a simple protocol: Revert Compoundor.\n\nPositions managed by the Compoundor contract can be auto-compounded by anyone. The ***autoCompound*** function takes any uncollected fees for a position, optionally swaps them to a determined ratio given the position range and the current pool price, and adds it as liquidity to the position.\n\nA small fraction of the *collected-and-compounded* fees are paid to the protocol and to compensate the accounts call the auto-compound function for their gas costs incurred. This performance fee is set to 2% on launch and by design can only be decreased, never increased.\n\nAdditionally once a position is added to the Compoundor protocol contract, the position owner is able to conveniently execute the ***autoCompound*** function at any time, in which case there are no fees charged aside from the regular gas costs of executing the call.\n\nWe are publishing a draft of a [whitepaper](https://hackmd.io/@revert/BJcGIJQ35) that explains how the protocol works and how we are estimating the expected benefits of auto-compounding for any position.\n\nAdditionally the protocol contracts have had an open bug bounty on Immunefi since June 14th.\n\n[https://github.com/revert-finance/compoundor](https://github.com/revert-finance/compoundor)\n\n[https://immunefi.com/bounty/revert/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/revert/)\n\nTo give it a try just visit your positions dashboard, and for any v3 position you will see a “Compound Fees” button at the bottom, by clicking on it a panel will expand that will show you the estimated benefits of auto-compounding your position given the current fee APRs.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D__XmTnOagS4ZCETk1gbN.png?height=3092&width=2196)\n\nThe total yearly improvement, and the time to break-even, will depend on each positions’ performance. Depending on each LPs strategy and expectations, auto-compounding might not be ideal. Particularly on high gas-price environments like Ethereum mainnet, auto-compounding should be attractive mostly to LPs with very high fee apr, or long expected time range on their positions.\n\nWe are also excited about launching this protocol/feature today simultaneously on [Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code), [Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code), [Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code), and [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5411894842e610c4d0f6ed4c232da689400f94a1#code).\n\nSo we hope you try it out, check if it makes sense for your current or future Uniswap v3 positions, and if you have any questions or comments, drop by our discord.", "timestamp": 1658167370, "digest": "CTbjZOjGcoDXd0EBy_f5BzOGA6f8TUmAlsM4Z2DVMaI", "contributor": "0x8cadb20A4811f363Dadb863A190708bEd26245F8"}

Organizations solicit personal data for access to their services and platforms. These barriers to entry can lead to exclusivity and discrimination. A user must create an account that provides at least a name and email, and often age, date of birth, race and ethnicity for every online act. This data is shared with third parties, subjecting the user to a harassment of unsolicited emails, ads, and messages. Once the information is in an entity's hands there is no telling what other uses it is exploited for.\n\n![Data Breach!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xQCN_s1oetGGdyoj6JhVd.jpeg?height=535&width=1024)\n\nThis process is repeated again and again for social media, retail, entertainment, event, financial, and professional accounts. The fracturing of our identity into countless pieces creates new vulnerabilities every time we engage with a service. The burden is on the user to manage access to all of these accounts for the privilege of private companies profiting from their data. This is an inefficient, broken system, without mentioning the challenges that arise if a password is forgotten.\n\nSimilarly, for every purchase made online the user has to enter their bank card or account information. This is a cumbersome and insecure process, creating new vulnerabilities when this data is transmitted or saved on a platforms centralized system. Blockchain technology solves the payment problem, requiring a user to simply sign a message to complete a transaction. However, payments are only one use case. Blockchain can also solve the broken identity management system, simply requiring message signing to access a new platform. The protocol that will make this possible is what we are building at Mu Methods.\n\n## The Solution\n\n![Singular Digital Identity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vg15xER5gUOTCUKdAPv9Q.jpeg?height=311&width=700)\n\nNo longer will a user need to give up personal information, creating a new account every time they want to access a service or join a community. When they access a new system it will only require a message to be signed in their wallet. Platforms will be connecting to their singular digital identity.\n\n### Identity Protocol\n\nTo accomplish this we have to fix the existing cryptographic identity system, then integrate it with payments and off-chain platforms. At Mu Methods we are laser-focused on step one: to provide a foundational identity infrastructure. Similar to the IPFS and blockchain solutions for p2p data transfer and asset management, our protocol is an open-source off-chain solution for public/private key management that can be utilized by any cryptographic identity provider. This network will address three primary issues: account linking, seed phrase recoverability, and decentralized application connectivity.\n\n### Account Linking\n\nCurrently connecting crypto accounts requires a user to import/export their seed phrase making it vulnerable to attack. If the seed phrase is unknown, they have to export it from their wallet. It may be stored incorrectly during this process, making it insecure. In addition, it adds a layer of complexity to the user experience. A user may create a new account every time they use a different wallet because they don't feel comfortable importing/exporting their seed phrase. Instead of importing/exporting our network will generate private linking keys to permission new accounts from a primary account, eliminating the need to access the seed phrase over and over again. Mu will generate permissioning private keys through state of the art signature schemes.\n\n### Seed Phrase Recoverability\n\nWhile this minimizes the need to access the seed phrase, it does not eliminate it. The current single failure point of recoverability is unsustainable and unscalable. If a user loses access to their account when they misplace their seed phrase they are unlikely to utilize it as a safe and secure method of identity and asset management. To solve recoverability for those instances in which a user has lost complete access to their account we will use key sharding. Instead of holding the entire seed phrase in one location it will be split and distributed among several nodes in the network. It is social recovery without the need of smart contracts or friends to distribute the shards to. If the user does not have trusted friends they will be provided with alternative locations for shard distribution. They will not be required to store their seed phrase.\n\n### Decentralized Application Connectivity\n\nIn order to transition to the single-tap connectivity necessary to access platforms with our digital ID's, wallet connect standards need an update. Currently a user needs to choose which wallet they are connecting from to communicate with a dapp. Our network will remove this step, no longer requiring the user to choose their wallet. When a dapp proposes to sign a transaction it will go through our network to be signed by any device key. Rather than requesting the local account, the dapp is told what account is going to sign for which transaction. All keys will act from one device/account.\n\n### Verified Credentials\n\nOnce these features are functioning the personal identification details required to engage with certain platforms ie. name, age, address, email, social security number, etc. can be securely stored with the network. These proven personal identifiers are referred to as verified credentials. They are private and only accessible if a user permissions them to be. For example, when a bank requires verified identifiers to engage with a client the user can one-tap permission access to the specific and limited information requested.\n\n### Financial Transactions\n\nWhile crypto payments are functional, they are not scalable. We are closely following legislation in the US and abroad regarding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) and stable-coins. Once crypto is legally defined traditional platforms' compliance departments will have a clear path to accepting crypto payments. Integrating these into the digital identities built on our network will eliminate the attack vectors created when financial account information is exposed.\n\n## Transition\n\nWe will begin onboarding to the network through pull requests and wallet reviews of the largest wallet providers by Unique Active Wallets. Additionally we will build a proof of concept wallet to demonstrate the networks functionality and security best practices. These strategies will upgrade existing wallet infrastructure as well as set a standard for new wallet providers.\n\nOur vision will take several years to realize and require collaboration with companies across the Web3 ecosystem working on verified credentials, payment systems, and KYC integration. It is going to take many solutions to build this reality. If there are potential synergies between your product and ours, DM’s are open! We are eager to work together and build the future of self-sovereign identity.\n\n**Jugal Patel**  \n Co-Founder  \n t.

{"id": "Ar1St_ZTpZLKgu9sP0TU5gvW0YSLMzFupztzF3GYCVY", "title": "The Next Step to Self-Sovereign Identity", "body": "## The Problem\n\nThe current model of the internet does not empower the individual. Organizations solicit personal data for access to their services and platforms. These barriers to entry can lead to exclusivity and discrimination. A user must create an account that provides at least a name and email, and often age, date of birth, race and ethnicity for every online act. This data is shared with third parties, subjecting the user to a harassment of unsolicited emails, ads, and messages. Once the information is in an entity's hands there is no telling what other uses it is exploited for.\n\n![Data Breach!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xQCN_s1oetGGdyoj6JhVd.jpeg?height=535&width=1024)\n\nThis process is repeated again and again for social media, retail, entertainment, event, financial, and professional accounts. The fracturing of our identity into countless pieces creates new vulnerabilities every time we engage with a service. The burden is on the user to manage access to all of these accounts for the privilege of private companies profiting from their data. This is an inefficient, broken system, without mentioning the challenges that arise if a password is forgotten.\n\nSimilarly, for every purchase made online the user has to enter their bank card or account information. This is a cumbersome and insecure process, creating new vulnerabilities when this data is transmitted or saved on a platforms centralized system. Blockchain technology solves the payment problem, requiring a user to simply sign a message to complete a transaction. However, payments are only one use case. Blockchain can also solve the broken identity management system, simply requiring message signing to access a new platform. The protocol that will make this possible is what we are building at Mu Methods.\n\n## The Solution\n\n![Singular Digital Identity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vg15xER5gUOTCUKdAPv9Q.jpeg?height=311&width=700)\n\nNo longer will a user need to give up personal information, creating a new account every time they want to access a service or join a community. When they access a new system it will only require a message to be signed in their wallet. Platforms will be connecting to their singular digital identity.\n\n### Identity Protocol\n\nTo accomplish this we have to fix the existing cryptographic identity system, then integrate it with payments and off-chain platforms. At Mu Methods we are laser-focused on step one: to provide a foundational identity infrastructure. Similar to the IPFS and blockchain solutions for p2p data transfer and asset management, our protocol is an open-source off-chain solution for public/private key management that can be utilized by any cryptographic identity provider. This network will address three primary issues: account linking, seed phrase recoverability, and decentralized application connectivity.\n\n### Account Linking\n\nCurrently connecting crypto accounts requires a user to import/export their seed phrase making it vulnerable to attack. If the seed phrase is unknown, they have to export it from their wallet. It may be stored incorrectly during this process, making it insecure. In addition, it adds a layer of complexity to the user experience. A user may create a new account every time they use a different wallet because they don't feel comfortable importing/exporting their seed phrase. Instead of importing/exporting our network will generate private linking keys to permission new accounts from a primary account, eliminating the need to access the seed phrase over and over again. Mu will generate permissioning private keys through state of the art signature schemes.\n\n### Seed Phrase Recoverability\n\nWhile this minimizes the need to access the seed phrase, it does not eliminate it. The current single failure point of recoverability is unsustainable and unscalable. If a user loses access to their account when they misplace their seed phrase they are unlikely to utilize it as a safe and secure method of identity and asset management. To solve recoverability for those instances in which a user has lost complete access to their account we will use key sharding. Instead of holding the entire seed phrase in one location it will be split and distributed among several nodes in the network. It is social recovery without the need of smart contracts or friends to distribute the shards to. If the user does not have trusted friends they will be provided with alternative locations for shard distribution. They will not be required to store their seed phrase.\n\n### Decentralized Application Connectivity\n\nIn order to transition to the single-tap connectivity necessary to access platforms with our digital ID's, wallet connect standards need an update. Currently a user needs to choose which wallet they are connecting from to communicate with a dapp. Our network will remove this step, no longer requiring the user to choose their wallet. When a dapp proposes to sign a transaction it will go through our network to be signed by any device key. Rather than requesting the local account, the dapp is told what account is going to sign for which transaction. All keys will act from one device/account.\n\n### Verified Credentials\n\nOnce these features are functioning the personal identification details required to engage with certain platforms ie. name, age, address, email, social security number, etc. can be securely stored with the network. These proven personal identifiers are referred to as verified credentials. They are private and only accessible if a user permissions them to be. For example, when a bank requires verified identifiers to engage with a client the user can one-tap permission access to the specific and limited information requested.\n\n### Financial Transactions\n\nWhile crypto payments are functional, they are not scalable. We are closely following legislation in the US and abroad regarding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) and stable-coins. Once crypto is legally defined traditional platforms' compliance departments will have a clear path to accepting crypto payments. Integrating these into the digital identities built on our network will eliminate the attack vectors created when financial account information is exposed.\n\n## Transition\n\nWe will begin onboarding to the network through pull requests and wallet reviews of the largest wallet providers by Unique Active Wallets. Additionally we will build a proof of concept wallet to demonstrate the networks functionality and security best practices. These strategies will upgrade existing wallet infrastructure as well as set a standard for new wallet providers.\n\nOur vision will take several years to realize and require collaboration with companies across the Web3 ecosystem working on verified credentials, payment systems, and KYC integration. It is going to take many solutions to build this reality. If there are potential synergies between your product and ours, DM’s are open! We are eager to work together and build the future of self-sovereign identity.\n\n**Jugal Patel** \n Co-Founder  \n t.

Meneer hoeft alleen zijn brood niet meer, gisteravond ook al moeilijk met het eten. Ook slapen had hij weinig zin in, moeten er bij blijven anders gaat hij huilen. Dus 2 uur laten huilen, met om en om 15 minuten even kort kijken. Dat wordt weer even dagelijks opbouwen voor zowel eten als slapen.  \n Update einde van de week: het slapen gaat steeds beter de goede kant op, we starten met voorlezen in deze hitte (en Morris bleek ziek te zijn deze week) en daarna doen we gewoon weglopen en om de 15 minuten kort kijken. Eten is allemaal goed gekomen, hij eet weer lekker mee. Wilt wel graag zelf eten, echt wel al een klein willetje \n* Contact gehad met de airdrop mensen en website issues verholpen rondom de mint. Titan aantal einde van de week staat op 53 titans van 35 unieke mensen. We zijn gestart.\n* Verder een ontspannen dag, veel kleine dingen opgepakt en gestart met Jansesn Journal op mirror (zie vorige post). \n* Ook toegevoegd: Imovie compilatie met de weekfoto’s (te vinden op de harde schijf atm) \n* Hanneke van Dam geholpen aan het einde van de dag met het minten van haar NFT en even lekker bijgepraat. Deze tech is echt nog lang niet klaar voor het grote publiek, ze liep op diverse onderdelen nog vast omdat het compleet nieuw is. Gelachen, kreeg veel energie van het gesprek. Idee: instapcursus/instaples voor complete beginners in het Nederlands op YouTube plaatsen. Samen met Saar en Joep de stappen doorlopen en uitleggen hoe alles werkt, dit opnemen en op YT zetten. \n* Eerste reacties op de NFTs zijn positief. \n* Ronde met Rowin gelpoen: inkopen positie op OtherSide NFT? Laten lopen uiteindelijk, gevoelsmatig ech tveel te overbetaald en overhyped. \n* DAO Funds overgemaakt naar de multisig. 5K. Ook op dit onderdeel zijn we voor het eggie gestart. Ik kan het gevoel maar niet afschudden dat alles wat we hier doen het begin is van een legendarisch traject. \n* Juna & Jack op date, samen eten in de speeltuin haha :-D \n* Idee: windvanger in de tuin hangen met van die chimes. Uiteindelijk zijn het schelpen aan een hanger geworden, ook mooi! \n* Gelachen met de KPN glasvezelkabelmannen. Was een jonkie mee die zijn eerste dag had (met zijn buurman), binnen gelaten en de mannen wat limo gegeven. Komt er eindelijk dan glasvezel aan (afspraak wordt later gemaakt)\n* Imovie dus gemaakt, uiteindelijk gekozen voor de auto compilatie ivm tijd. \n* MI2 gekeken, wederom leuk! \n* Energie los laten gooien (Saar drukt met elleboog op beide binnenbenen en werkt vanuit knie omhoog naar lies via binnenkant dij in groef). Veel losgekomen, voelde goed, negatieve energie en ijzeren grip in mijn hoofd kwam los. Erg veel gedroomd, dus misschien beter om in de ochtend te doen \n\n## Dinsdag 12 juli\n\n* 6 minuten plan. Hardop schreeuwen, ondersteund met muziek om stem in mijn hoofd te overschreeuwen en af te leiden. Zo zie je dat je de grens behoorlijk kan verleggen als je die klotestem soms uitzet. Niet altijd blij met de stem in mijn hoofd dus blijkbaar.\n* Minder keelpijn. Update: achteraf bleek dat het nog een flinke zit werd deze week, nog steeds wel last en vermoeid alleen lijkt het nu wel de goede kant op te gaan. \n* Meiden alles zelfstandig voorbereid voor het strand (ingesmeerd, badpakjes aan, saar was al naar werk haha) \n* Instaples opgezet zoals besproken op ma 11 juli: Jor & Saar - crypto dummies. Leuk om neer te zetten. \n  * Superfood report binnen geharkt. Samenvattend:  \n My superfoods: bruine rijst, kersen, cocoa 70%, dille, vijgen, lam, nectarine, oats, haver, olijven, oregano, papaya, persimmon, dadelpruim, pomegranate, raspberry, wilde zalm, sauerkraut, sweet papato or yam, watermelon, white mushroom \n Ontwijken: artichoke, aspergus, beef, bell pepper (paprika), brocolli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, caviar or roe, cod (kabeljauw), crayfish (rivierkreeft), eigeel, goat, haddock (schelvis), lobster, mustard greens, scallops, pepino melon, shrimp, tomaat, turmeric, turnip, venison or elk (eland). \n* Meiden naar het strand gegaan, papa na lange twijfel toch thuis gebleven. \n\n## Woensdag 13 juli\n\n* 15 jaar verkering :-) Morris opgepakt op wederom onmogelijke tijd, met de meiden ontbijt op bed gemaakt, klusjes gedaan en gelijk vol gas gegaan ipv rustig aan gedaan en mijn rust gepakt. Ook icm de kijkles etc. De prijs later op de dag dubbel en dwars betaald: charijnig doordat ik zo moe was (vermodelijk ook door virus). \n* In de ochtend was het wel een waar circus en ontbijt op bed in 1. \n* Kijkzwemles was ook erg leuk: wat deden ze het goed! Papa gaat ook les nemen van Heidi, goed instapmoment wel nog te kiezen (even over de drempel heen). Gefietst naar Voorhout, heerijk. \n* Geluksmoment: thee valt weer om, ditmaal over het bureau, maar niets werd geraakt wat schade opleverde. Alles viel naast mij en naast de spullen, mogelijk wel het bibliotheekboek vies uds even berichten bij de bieb. Update: schoon gemaakt, karma test doorstaan :-) \n* Biertje in de Veen was gezellig, even met Rowin bijgepraat. Echter de rit naartoe was niet leuk, veel te chagrijnig en moe. Had het even niet meer. \n* In de avond eten voorschoten ging het wel weer een beetje, maar nog steeds erg moe en zeker niet happy. Wachten op eten duurde lang en uit eten met Moor is gewoon pittig omdat je veel te veel met hem bezig moet zijn (vliegt alle kanten op haha)\n* Koios busines model uitgewerkt met focus op de bal, zie 14 juli uitwerking\n* Juna geen onderbroek mee op de terugweg, arme meid haha\n* Morris mama goed geholpen met het meebezemen en schoonmaken van de tuin! \n* MI3, ijs, heerlijk geslapen! \n* 15 mooie rode rozen voor mijn geweldige vrouw gehaald, was is het toch echt een prachtig wezen op elke manier hoe een mens kan zijn. Mooie kanten, minder mooie kanten. Ze is.\n* \n\n## Donderdag 14 Juli \n\n* Goed geslapen, enkel het dunne hoeslaken en vermoeidheid (flink!) deden denk de truc. \n* Veel in mijn hoofdmet allerlei plannen. Ik onderneem nu geen radicale grote stappen, enkel kleintjes. Met hyperfocus. Mogelijk vermoeid en nu wat energie komt duiken we gelijk weer de diepte in. HOLD!!\n* Met Moor gedouched. Hij vindt het zitten leuk, met ramenwiser, maar wilt niet te dicht met zijn bol bij de straal. En ook niet getild worden. \n* Vandaag komt de kast :-) Update: toch niet, kwam uiteindelijk vrjidag 15 juli, is erg mooi! \n* Met Joepie gaan eten, was nog steeds erg moe om er vol van te genieten, dus gaan we snel even goed over doen. \n* Shiatsu, was de laatste massage omdat Sebastiaan (van Leeuwen) er vandoor gaat. Hoofd voelt als lood, ogen moe, keelpijn. Lijkt wel los te komen, tuk gedaan \n* Heidi voor zwemles gecontact\n* Toekomst van speels Koios in een droom gezien: digitaal, pretparkachtig, vogelvlucht kon je alles overzien, in 3D, kon je iets selecteren en dan inzoomen (alsof je van vogelvlucht erin dook, daar zag je dan vervolgens het spel spelen met de anderen deelnemers en kijkers eromheen! Essentieel: iedereen was eigenaar van zijn/haar eigen stukje van de plattegrond. Deel van de kaart was algemeen bezit, maar in het noorden was de speeltuin en daar bezaten mensen eigen bezit. \n* Hele leuke film gezien in café Druk mijn Snor: Sea Beast. Inclusief B&Jerry\n* Morris eet weer goed. Wel speen overdag en die gaan we dus wegdoen vanaf nu. Update: Dit lijkt lekker te lopen. Ook het in slaap vallen met weglopen gaat stuk beter! \n* Flinke ingeving voor Koios verbetervoorstellen. Heeft uiteindelijk geleidt tot een klein document met mini roadmap voor september. Met Titan Trollbox iedereen individueel rondom de tafel zitten en meningen verzamelen. \n\nVrijdag 15 en zaterdag 16 juli \n\n* Vergeten leuke dingen bij te houden! Oeps, merk ook dat het daardoor wat minder ‘chill / flowerig’ verloopt. RUST pakken Jor :-) \n* De BBq met de fam en kids was geweldig, vooral de avondbioscoop vond ik superleuk voor de kids om te doen (herinneringen maken). Lieke natuurlijk ook uitgenodigd. \n* Naar de markt met de meiden (race gewonnen wie als eerst beneden was!), mooie bloemen op de markt kunnen vinden, fruit was ook erg goed en superfoods ingeslagen uit rapport. \n* 1 op 1 met Fiene in de bios (was wel moe, god was is dat vervelend)\n* Patatjes met ijs als avondeten! \n* 10 tellen in de rimboe gedaan met de kids \n* Geverfd! Mooi geworden \n* Tuin opgeknapt en nieuwe dressoir geinstalleerd. Nieuwe TV is next (is besteld op maandag de 18e)\n\nZondag 17 juli\n\n* heerlijk gewandeld met ma in Amsterdamse waterleidingduinen.

Organizations solicit personal data for access to their services and platforms. These barriers to entry can lead to exclusivity and discrimination. A user must create an account that provides at least a name and email, and often age, date of birth, race and ethnicity for every online act. This data is shared with third parties, subjecting the user to a harassment of unsolicited emails, ads, and messages. Once the information is in an entity's hands there is no telling what other uses it is exploited for.\n\n![Data Breach!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xQCN_s1oetGGdyoj6JhVd.jpeg?height=535&width=1024)\n\nThis process is repeated again and again for social media, retail, entertainment, event, financial, and professional accounts. The fracturing of our identity into countless pieces creates new vulnerabilities every time we engage with a service. The burden is on the user to manage access to all of these accounts for the privilege of private companies profiting from their data. This is an inefficient, broken system, without mentioning the challenges that arise if a password is forgotten.\n\nSimilarly, for every purchase made online the user has to enter their bank card or account information. This is a cumbersome and insecure process, creating new vulnerabilities when this data is transmitted or saved on a platforms centralized system. Blockchain technology solves the payment problem, requiring a user to simply sign a message to complete a transaction. However, payments are only one use case. Blockchain can also solve the broken identity management system, simply requiring message signing to access a new platform. The protocol that will make this possible is what we are building at Mu Methods.\n\n## The Solution\n\n![Singular Digital Identity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vg15xER5gUOTCUKdAPv9Q.jpeg?height=311&width=700)\n\nNo longer will a user need to give up personal information, creating a new account every time they want to access a service or join a community. When they access a new system it will only require a message to be signed in their wallet. Platforms will be connecting to their singular digital identity.\n\n### Identity Protocol\n\nTo accomplish this we have to fix the existing cryptographic identity system, then integrate it with payments and off-chain platforms. At Mu Methods we are laser-focused on step one: to provide a foundational identity infrastructure. Similar to the IPFS and blockchain solutions for p2p data transfer and asset management, our protocol is an open-source off-chain solution for public/private key management that can be utilized by any cryptographic identity provider. This network will address three primary issues: account linking, seed phrase recoverability, and decentralized application connectivity.\n\n### Account Linking\n\nCurrently connecting crypto accounts requires a user to import/export their seed phrase making it vulnerable to attack. If the seed phrase is unknown, they have to export it from their wallet. It may be stored incorrectly during this process, making it insecure. In addition, it adds a layer of complexity to the user experience. A user may create a new account every time they use a different wallet because they don't feel comfortable importing/exporting their seed phrase. Instead of importing/exporting our network will generate private linking keys to permission new accounts from a primary account, eliminating the need to access the seed phrase over and over again. Mu will generate permissioning private keys through state of the art signature schemes.\n\n### Seed Phrase Recoverability\n\nWhile this minimizes the need to access the seed phrase, it does not eliminate it. The current single failure point of recoverability is unsustainable and unscalable. If a user loses access to their account when they misplace their seed phrase they are unlikely to utilize it as a safe and secure method of identity and asset management. To solve recoverability for those instances in which a user has lost complete access to their account we will use key sharding. Instead of holding the entire seed phrase in one location it will be split and distributed among several nodes in the network. It is social recovery without the need of smart contracts or friends to distribute the shards to. If the user does not have trusted friends they will be provided with alternative locations for shard distribution. They will not be required to store their seed phrase.\n\n### Decentralized Application Connectivity\n\nIn order to transition to the single-tap connectivity necessary to access platforms with our digital ID's, wallet connect standards need an update. Currently a user needs to choose which wallet they are connecting from to communicate with a dapp. Our network will remove this step, no longer requiring the user to choose their wallet. When a dapp proposes to sign a transaction it will go through our network to be signed by any device key. Rather than requesting the local account, the dapp is told what account is going to sign for which transaction. All keys will act from one device/account.\n\n### Verified Credentials\n\nOnce these features are functioning the personal identification details required to engage with certain platforms ie. name, age, address, email, social security number, etc. can be securely stored with the network. These proven personal identifiers are referred to as verified credentials. They are private and only accessible if a user permissions them to be. For example, when a bank requires verified identifiers to engage with a client the user can one-tap permission access to the specific and limited information requested.\n\n### Financial Transactions\n\nWhile crypto payments are functional, they are not scalable. We are closely following legislation in the US and abroad regarding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) and stable-coins. Once crypto is legally defined traditional platforms' compliance departments will have a clear path to accepting crypto payments. Integrating these into the digital identities built on our network will eliminate the attack vectors created when financial account information is exposed.\n\n## Transition\n\nWe will begin onboarding to the network through pull requests and wallet reviews of the largest wallet providers by Unique Active Wallets. Additionally we will build a proof of concept wallet to demonstrate the networks functionality and security best practices. These strategies will upgrade existing wallet infrastructure as well as set a standard for new wallet providers.\n\nOur vision will take several years to realize and require collaboration with companies across the Web3 ecosystem working on verified credentials, payment systems, and KYC integration. It is going to take many solutions to build this reality. If there are potential synergies between your product and ours, DM’s are open! We are eager to work together and build the future of self-sovereign identity.\n\n**Jugal Patel**  \n Co-Founder  \n t.

It is going to take many solutions to build this reality. If there are potential synergies between your product and ours, DM’s are open! We are eager to work together and build the future of self-sovereign identity.\n\n**Jugal Patel**  \n Co-Founder  \n t.

Die Twitter Follower Zahl ist bereits auf über **100k** angestiegen, obwohl die App bisher nur in der Alpha Version und im BSC Testnetz verfügbar war. \n  \n Wir können uns also auf **tolles Marketing** und spannende Partnerschaften freuen, vor Allem sollen **Spitzensportler** an Bord geholt werden.\n\n![](https://befitter.io/assets/sec2/lease.png)\n\n### Soll ich in beFITTER investieren?\n\nDiese Frage musst du dir selbst beantworten.

{"id": "Usz2d7EUowa-09JuYALMARNblpA7PAUineVm_QKubbo", "title": "Should Cannabis Genome DAO Own A Lab?", "body": "## Web3 Is About Aligning Incentives\n\nWe think the genomic testing world could use a little more transparency and emphasis on the rights of individuals to control their data. This initiative would make Cannabis Genome DAO the first digital cooperative to maintain an ownership stake in a physical laboratory. As such, Cannabis Genome DAO would be granted full rights of a member of the company with access to financial reporting and an ability to ensure that the fidelity and transparency of laboratory practices are maintained. The alignment of incentives and governance rights between a community that benefits from using the laboratory, with the governance and incentives of the laboratory operations itself, directly benefits the community and users of the laboratories services.\n\n## Overview of Proposed Crowdfund\n\nFunding would go toward purchasing a membership interest in Delta Leaf, which is currently undergoing equity fundraising in pursuit of a traditional VC investment or strategic partnership from another organization. This provides the opportunity for Cannabis Genome DAO to fill that need. Funding from the sale of membership interest in Delta Leaf would be used for improving and expanding their services. These services include an upgrade to the Delta Leaf web app that would enable users to manage their laboratory results using self-custodial web3 wallets with the option to publish directly to the data marketplace being developed by Cannabis Genome DAO. Governance of Delta Leaf would be aligned with the mission and values of Cannabis Genome DAO because members of the latter would exert a significant amount of direct control over the operations of the former.\n\nThe crowdfund would be hosted here on Mirror and structured as a sale of a collection of tiered NFT editions. More information below.\n\n* [Cannabis Genome DAO](https://cannabisgeno.me) (“CGD”) would purchase a 20% membership interest in [Delta Leaf Laboratories LLC](https://deltaleaflabs.com) (“Delta Leaf”), a California Limited Liability Corporation.\n* Cannabis Genome DAO (“CGD\") is a \"[nonprofit association](https://ipfs//bafybeifzhrfh47zq743j35hq7v6lwmoqizzj665hwp7zzoqig6abveog6i/?filename=Delaware_UNA_Agreement_-_CGD.pdf)\" under the Delaware Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, §§ 1901-1916. CGD is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a partnership.\n* Governance of the CGD’s membership interest in Delta Leaf would be managed through the distribution of DLL tokens to members of CGD who contribute to this fundraiser.\n* The total DLL token supply would exclusively distribute governance rights to CGD members and does not distribute ownership right in Delta Leaf to individual members of CGD.\n* DLL tokens would not, and will not, represent any financial claim by individual CGD members to potential profit or obligation to potential losses incurred by CGD while CGD is acting as a member of Delta Leaf.\n* CGD and the CGD treasury would incur all financial profit and loss related to membership of CGD in Delta Leaf. The proceeds of this crowdfund will be sent to the CGD community multi-sig for the explicit purpose of completing the purchase of a membership interest in Delta Leaf as described herein.\n\n![Felipe's cousin Isaac made this graphic years ago.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D9MgsIfEXNqBfUuhtGwnJ.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n## DLL Token Allocations\n\nGovernance of Delta Leaf comprises a subset of the proposed activities encompassed by the [CGD Community Hyperthesis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/182fZ2WIQCL15O0TbQmkaJFM8tci06czuuqTMzBl_-zs/edit?usp=sharing). Therefore, the token allocation will primarily be distributed directly to participants in the crowdfunding campaign with only 20% being reserved for community management by CGD itself.

{"id": "pU_elmalCUXkcTVmcCmQxfynX8iPJ3-ftRLiIQalWSM", "title": "What DAOs Can Learn from Rainbow — 50yrs of Decentralized Autonomous Gathering", "body": "## The Immense Potential of DAOs\n\nFor an in-depth yet beginner friendly introduction to DAOs, please check out [this NYTimes article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/what-are-daos.html).\n\nHistorically, centralized power seemed to have obviously ‘won’ against the decentralized crowd —— we have witnessed how local faiths overpowered by organized religions, co-ops outcompeted by conglomerates, indigenous tribes eliminated by empires. We live in a world where profit incentives aren’t aligned with the common wealth and resources are shamefully extracted to maximize profit for individual gains.\n\nWithout doubt, technologies are best used to serve humanity’s overall well-being. Blockchain solutions can be used to realign our incentives, create equitable and transparent systems to avoid corruption and exploitation. The DAO space has huge potential to create **community-oriented autonomous templates to fundamentally decentralize the way humans operate** in order to **create abundance for all.**\n\n![Homemade meme about DAOs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TrgE2iuoFa1Fvi7OIiyOx.png?height=1011&width=1166)\n\nWithin a system that is transparent and fair, people would operate better because they ‘can’t do bad’ instead of ‘won’t do bad’. The Gitcoin’s theory on [ImpactDAOs](https://store.gitcoin.co/products/impactdao-book-digital-edition) did a deep dive into this philosophy.\n\nIt is worth noting that DAOs are still in its infancy, most DAOs are in its process of figuring out the best suited ways to govern. Many DAOs have very long and redundant execution processes as a protection against centralized dictatorship which often led to inefficiency and bureaucracy. Being born at the heart of the crypto industry, DAOs can be filled with pyramid scams and inflated values.\n\nBecause of the immaturity and capital-infested nature of crypto, learnings on the art of gathering and coordination may best come from outside of the DAO space. Humans have been organizing in swift and ingenue ways centuries before blockchain technology appeared.\n\nDAOs are schelling points for strangers to gather around a shared mission & vision and collectively accumulate resources to achieve this shared goal. —— This is exactly what [Rainbow Gathering](https://rainbowfamilygatherings.net/) has achieved in the past 50 years without blockchain.\n\n## What is the Rainbow Gathering?\n\n![Pic from SDBP Radio](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NHzQChJZjYJaW7Pb2-dou.png?height=542&width=880)\n\n*Special Thanks to [@mycobici](https://twitter.com/mycobici) for encouraging me to go to the 50 years Rainbow Gathering and drawing the analogy between Rainbow and DAOs. Special Thanks to [@imu](https://www.instagram.com/zenthebus/) for sending me courage, love and the Rainbow Gathering coordinate. 💕*\n\nI heard about the rainbow gathering from an off-grid eco village at the southern tip of Hilo, Hawaii.\n\n“It’s a gathering about peace, love and generosity. It is completely free to go and everything was shared in a gift-based society”, said someone from the eco village, who at the time refuses to have a cellphone or wear shoes.\n\n“There is no tickets, no social media. Location changes every year mostly in different national forests and the only way to find out is through word of mouth.\n\nThe gatherings also happen all around the world. Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Costa Rica, Mexico… and here on the Big Island! The main gathering is in the US every year, the main international gathering rotates around the world, and there are regionals happening all the time.”\n\nRainbow Gathering started in 1972, it is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Gathering) as a gathering where people ‘congregate in remote forests around the world for one or more weeks at a time with the stated intention of living a shared ideology of peace, harmony, freedom, and respect.’\n\nThe first gathering happened in Colorado where twenty thousand people faced police roadblocks, threatened [civil disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience), and were allowed onto [National Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Forest) land. It has spontaneously become a yearly tradition ever since.\n\nIn this anti-capitalist and anti-materialist world, people put up temporary cabins and tents, campfires and water filters, shared everything in a mutually respectful way. Regardless of cultural background or race, people shared a common language that is peace and love.\n\n![Pic of Rainbow from Sky-Hi News](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z2Savl-0dyYT_81p5EB0F.png?height=637&width=1024)\n\nIt is worth iterating that there are natural problems that come with the gathering, I do not wish to say that everything happens with the Rainbow community is always positive. The concerns about Rainbow Gathering will be claimed in the section in the end.\n\n## How Decentralized?\n\nThe gathering has no single leader, no corporation and usually no money involved except for some donations. All organizers gather and find common grounds cooperatively. Anyone that felt the urge to contribute can volunteer to organize since helping hands are always needed.\n\nAt each gathering, organizers would arrive weeks in advance to pave roads, study the terrain and plan out the locations. Different kitchen crews would put up camps with cookware, shelves, washing stations, toilet holes and sometimes showers. Individuals usually gather around the kitchens, enjoy the meals and help out when they can.\n\n![Reverse Osmosis Connected to River Water](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/By8WYji7f2M2sDBxgsCII.jpg?height=716&width=1000)\n\nEach camp has its own culture and quite unique characteristics. In the 50yr’s gathering in Colorado, **Instant Soup** served vegan soup 24/7 and always had elderly folks singing around campfire every night. **Wanna Burn** was a kitchen organized by nomad performers and fire spinners and they just felt like lovely pirates. I was told by the crew if anyone took out a cellphone at the kitchen it would get smashed. **Kids Village** as the name suggested were a fun space for kids to run around with small bridges and swings.\n\n![Pic from Atlas Obscura](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kqlMdmqaYgMyuQv4guELZ.png?height=2474&width=3235)\n\nEach kitchen dug its ‘compost’ holes for organic matters and buried them after they’re full. ‘Shitters’ were dug at various locations and ashes and dirt were put on them to avoid flies and diseases. All non-organic trash were carried out by volunteers as people started to leave. Crates from recycle companies were placed at the entrance of the gathering.\n\nAt the center you can find **Info Camp** where all info and activities can be found on bulletin boards, medical tents where student volunteers treated the sick and injured.\n\n![Map about the 2022 Gathering in Colorado](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z-ids5g5ZGXDsci0ACZ1q.png?height=1097&width=843)\n\nDuring the gathering, various events were celebrated and projects were made. On July 4th, everyone gathered in the main lawn and prayed in silence for world peace. People put together sweat lodges, had meetings about permaculture and eco villages. There was yoga and Tai-chi practices, poetry nights, music circles, fire dancing… Basically, if enough people want to make something happen, it would happen.\n\n## Unanimous Consensus\n\n![Rainbow Family Pic from Wikipedia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PWXQIX4NRhW0hSyHjU62x.jpg?height=900&width=1200)\n\nThe most important decision every gathering is where to have Rainbow next year. This decision is made by the ‘Vision Circle’ which is usually held at the end of each gathering. Anyone who shows up at the Vision Circle would may speak and hold voting power regardless of their expertise. Unanimous consensus is required for any decisions to be made, the Vision Circle sometimes take days to complete in order to reach consensus.\n\nI sat at the Vision Circle for hours just to observe the process, it reminds me of filibustering in politics. Although the difference is that anyone who wanted to speak can speak, and there is absolutely no interruption to anyone’s speech.\n\nMajority of people do not feel the need to participate in this decision making process. Since the location rotates every year across the US, it seems like a natural flow of evenly distributed choices.\n\nI do believe Vision Circle exists more for the spirit of making sure everyone’s voice is heard. **The nature of unanimous consensus symbolizes that individual satisfaction is less important than group cohesion and harmony, which in itself is a quite beautiful spirit for any organization.** There will always be someone dissatisfied in the end, but everyone still celebrates when a decision was made.\n\n## How Autonomous?\n\nThe idea of Rainbow got brought to different corners of the world by people attended the first few gatherings. It has shown that decentralized social movements can be ‘templatized’. Once the formula has been play-tested, it can be ‘forked’ to different places and adopted to its local culture.\n\n**The formula is intuitive and the message is simple and powerful.**\n\nJust like how [Maslow summarized universal structure of basic human needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html#:\\~:text=From%20the%20bottom%20of%20the,attend%20to%20needs%20higher%20up.), Rainbow summarized universal solutions about gathering in the forest.\n\nBasic survival practices such as: choosing location with the right climate and source of water, setting up kitchen with chopped wood, preparing filters for river water, digging ‘shitters’ and burying feces with ashes and soil so diseases don’t spread, having event calendar visible in central info station, having safe words and other codes of conducts… All these formula are simple enough to be put into a handbook that can be carried cross boarder and language and learned quite intuitively, most of them might already be known by experienced outdoor survivors.\n\nJust a good formula is not enough without a strong motivation to gather of course. Getting a group of unmotivated people to do things is harder than making pigs fly. For Rainbow, the motive to gather comes is simple and powerful, it is that **everybody is welcome in this gift-based society of love and peace** —— a message quite hard to say no to.\n\nAs long as people feel the need to gather, people would find ways to do so. The gathering is very much an organic and natural formation. Nothing is forced, nothing is paid for, nothing is for show, nothing is for sale. People gathered and united around a common mission in a completely authentic and compassionate way.\n\nJust like how songs and stories spread across continents way before the birth of telegraph or internet, just like a good meme, penetrating through firewalls and cultural differences, whenever an art form or a message resonates with people deeply and fundamentally, it will flow effortlessly for as far as it can.\n\n## The Giving Culture as a Schelling Point\n\nMany would say Rainbow is a counter culture movement, it is everything ‘default society’ is not. The Rainbow culture is simple enough to spread far across cultures and borders, yet profound enough to create amazing impact on individuals.\n\nIt’s quite fascinating to have hiked miles into deep forest to be offered massages and served organic vegan soup for as many times as you want, none of which cost anything.\n\nWe talk about ‘flipping the game theory’ and ‘incentive alignment’ a lot in the DAO space, and the folks at Rainbow did it in such a simple way ---- a demographic that supposedly has little wealth proved that achieving abundance with very little is possible. It really does make you rethink about post scarcity differently. Even thou it might not be long term sustainable and comes with its own set of problems, there are still things we can learn from.\n\nParadigm shift need to come from mental shift, or as the new age hippies would call it: a consciousness shift. I do believe that with any emerging communication or governance technology, **the cultural spirit would be at the center of any social movement.** There would be no social change without a mentality shift free of existing construct of exploitations and unhealthy competitions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nJust like a knife can be used to cut butter or to kill people, the technology can be misused if it wasn’t intentional. Just because DAOs share the same technology doesn’t mean they share the same principle of operations. DAOs can be ‘central banks’, they can be outright valueless scams, or continued exploitations with cycles of pump and dump.\n\n**We aim to create systems where people ‘can’t act bad’, but it’s also crucial to create a culture where people ‘don’t want to act bad’. These two aspects, the spirit and the form, should be treated with equal importance in order to co-create something beautiful. That’s when DAOs meet Rainbow.**\n\nDAOs are by nature community oriented, and the community would seed the culture of the DAO. I believe [DAOs have potential to change how we coordinate and operate in many ways](https://blog.aragon.org/10-industries-being-disrupted-by-daos/), with a precondition that their shared mission is **simple and clearly defined, with authentic passion adhering to one’s intrinsic value**, and hopefully, oriented towards creating better future for all living beings. ❤️\n\n## Disclaimer —— Warnings About Rainbow ⚠️\n\nWithout over glorifying Rainbow, it’s important to mention the negative aspects of its culture.\n\nBecause everyone is welcomed, there is no guarantee that everybody at the gathering will behave in a mutually respectful way. Because it is free, there is a natural influx of people who live on the streets without homes. Because of its emphasis on personal freedom, there is always an abundance of illegal drugs.\n\nBecause of the anti-capitalistic mentality as its spirit, many people choose to be **anti-productivity** as well. Lots of people choose not to work or do anything constructive, and it became a gateway to indulgence in hedonism and anti-accomplishment mentality. The press and rumors about Rainbow are also mostly negative for all these reasons.\n\n**Here’s my observation at the gathering:**\n\nGoing to the gathering by myself for the first time, I was unsure of what to expect and was on high alert, very soon I relaxed and felt right at home. I’ve had many fun conversations with various characters of all ages and cultural backgrounds, gypsy flow artists from Europe, qi-gong masters from China, energy healers from Israel, farmers from Iowa, intentional village organizers from Tennessee, nomads from Bosnia, musicians from Turkey… It was a fun and diverse group of people, I felt accepted, respected and most of the time enjoyed everyone’s company.\n\nThere was an abundance of psychedelic drugs and weed being shared at the gathering. Most of them given out for free to people who ask for them. Occasionally you would see people tripping hard and acting ‘over the top’, however, comparing to a regular music festival, I would say it actually has a lot less of non-sober people — which was a total surprise for me.\n\nRainbow was a lot more family oriented compare to regular music festivals. There were many kids and elderly, many people I met brought their parents. Preparing and sharing group meals and singing in music circles were the majority of the activities. I would personally bring my parents to a Rainbow Gathering but probably not Burning Man.\n\nThe only ‘iffy thing’ that I observed was when someone looked like in high adrenaline said another ‘crazy’ person was trying to attack him and he dodged away. It did remind me that this was an event that everyone is welcome and everything is allowed so we do have to be cautious.\n\nAlthough it might be inevitable to have zero trash and disturbance to the environment given the scale of the gathering, I do think the organizers and volunteers did their best to protect local environment, they would spend weeks cleaning up everything after everyone leaves, ‘putting rocks back where they’re supposed to be’, said Scottie, an Urban designer from Yale who’s been organizing Rainbow for decades, ’The location was strategically chosen to be far away from river sources to protect the local water’s ecosystem.’ Everyone was also informed to only use dead trees for campfire wood and structure building.\n\n## More Conclusions!\n\nIn the end I want to say that this post is not suggesting that if everyone becomes hippies and gather in the woods we would solve all world’s problems, nor that Rainbow is an absolute golden formula for DAOs to learn from.\n\nThe Rainbow Gathering is a formula that worked for decades, with a simple and beautiful message. It exists because it needs to exist and it will continue to exist as long as enough people make it happen, it will always be at the cross of the supply and demand curve, and the longer it goes, the more experienced it would be at decentralized autonomous gathering.\n\nAfter hearing many negative comments and press about Rainbow I was glad to experience it myself and make my own distinction. I’m eternally grateful that something simple and beautiful can be experienced with no barrier of entry, and see people take care of each other with so much generosity and unconditional love. I have restored some faith in humanity, and felt encouraged to pursuit what I’m called to do ---- using technology to serve the holistic well being of humans and create abundance for all. 🌈\n\n![Rainbow Gathering 2022, Main Circle](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xPa-dPjMhfUoe_xtWE0I5.jpg?height=602&width=1200)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658168570, "digest": "eU8IjkDPEbliTU96YyrlE0rW1nhMORS7cFjq-ZN3oMI", "contributor": "0x79A99912f8890DB72EEF59dd92Baa0935D133856"}

完美地融入了这种新的叙述，并且与从公共分布式账本到机器学习的不同领域相关。\n\n全同态加密是一种传说中的技术（至少在密码学界），它允许对加密数据进行任意计算。由于隐私是整个技术的主要关注点，完全同态加密 (FHE) 完全适合这种新的叙述。FHE 与公共分布式账本（如区块链）和机器学习相关。\n\n第一个 FHE 计划于 2009 年由 Craig Gentry 成功构建。从那时起，已经提出了许多 FHE 方案，并且在该领域没有缺乏相关工作。但是，对于为什么要完成所有这些工作或其中任何工作的动机，几乎没有解释。刚开始学习 FHE 时，我有很多疑问：为什么会有这么多方案？FHE 有实际用例吗？如果 FHE 像描述的那样强大，为什么它还没有起飞？\n\n我们将首先介绍 FHE 的工作原理以及它可能有用的一些领域。文章的重点在第 2 部分，我们在其中考虑了为什么FHE 尚未受到广泛关注以及这些问题的一些潜在解决方案。TL; DR 是目前使用 FHE 库时完全缺乏可用性。FHE 方案的所有内部工作原理和复杂性（其中有很多）都暴露给工程师。\n\n最后，如果您有兴趣亲自动手，我们将指向该领域的一些库。\n\n### 什么是全同态加密（FHE）？\n\n全同态加密是一种加密方案，允许您对加密数据执行任意\\*计算。\n\n* 不完全正确，但我们暂时将其排除在外\n\n### 公钥加密方案的复习\n\n让我们从加密方案的简要回顾开始。明文是明文数据（即未加密数据），而密文是加密数据。\n\n加密方案中的算法\n加密方案包括以下 3 种算法：\n\n**1**  KeyGen(...security_parameters)→ keys：密钥生成算法将一些安全参数作为其输入。然后它输出方案的密钥。\n\n**2** Encrypt(plaintext, key, randomness)→ ciphertext：加密算法将明文、密钥和一些随机性（加密必须是概率性的才能“安全”）作为输入。然后输出相应的密文（即加密数据）。\n\n**3** Decrypt(ciphertext, key)→ plaintext：解密算法将密文和密钥作为输入。它输出相应的明文。\n\n在私钥加密方案中，同样key用于加密和解密。这意味着任何可以加密明文（即明文数据）的人也可以解密密文（即加密数据）。这些类型的加密方案也被称为“对称”，因为加密/解密之间的关系是对称的。\n\n然而，在公钥加密方案中，不同的密钥用于加密和解密。个人可能能够加密数据，但无法解密相应的密文。这些类型的加密方案也被称为“非对称”，因为加密/解密之间的关系是非对称的。\n\n您之前可能听说过 [ElGamal 加密方案]() （它基于[Diffie-Hellman 密钥交换](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)）。这些方案通常在介绍性密码学课程中教授，并且（在大多数现代应用中）依赖于一种常用的密码学类型，称为[椭圆曲线密码学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)。\n\n### 那么“同态”部分是什么意思呢？\n\n我们将把重点转向同态（公钥）加密方案，因为它们是最有用的。“同态”部分意味着在明文空间（即所有有效的明文）与密文空间（即所有有效的密文）中执行计算之间存在特殊关系。\n\n具体来说，在“同态加密方案”中，以下关系成立：\n\n同态加法：Encrypt(a) + Encrypt(b) = Encrypt(a + b)\n同态乘法：Encrypt(a) \\* Encrypt(b) = Encrypt(a \\* b)\n允许您执行以下操作：\nEncrypt(3xy + x) = Encrypt(3xy) + Encrypt(x) = \\[3 \\* Encrypt(x) \\* Encrypt(y)\\] + Encrypt(x)\n\n所以只要知道Encrypt(x)和Encrypt(y)，我们就可以计算更复杂的多项式表达式的加密。\n\n### 它是如何工作的？直觉是什么？\n\n简称Encrypt(a)为a'。简称Encrypt(b)为b'。回想一下a'和b'是密文。\n\n每次我们执行同态操作时，我们都会在密文中添加额外的噪声。在某些时候，如果噪声太大，您将无法成功解密密文。你只是运气不好。对于同态加法，噪声不会增长得太厉害。您可以将噪声增长视为Noise(a' + b') = Noise(a') + Noise(b')。然而，问题在于执行同态乘法。在同态乘法中，噪声增长表现为Noise(a' \\* b') = Noise(a') \\* Noise(b')。\n\n让我们用一些数字来使这更具体。我们会说Noise(a')是 10。我们会说Noise(b')是 20。FHE 方案有一些噪声上限，在此之后我们无法解密密文，即使我们有解密密钥。对于我们的示例，假设噪声上限为 300。在两个密文之间执行一次同态加法后，噪声将为10 + 20 = 30。不错！a'但是，如果我们在和之间执行单个同态乘法b'，则生成的噪声将10 \\* 20 = 200针对密文a' \\* b'。如果我们然后尝试计算(a' \\* b') \\* (a')，对于 FHE 方案来说，噪声将太大！(a' \\* b') \\* (a')因此，即使我们有解密密钥（因为Noise(a' \\* b') \\* Noise(a') = 200 \\* 10 = 2000），我们也无法解密。\n\n正确设置方案的所有参数，在正确的时间执行“噪声控制”操作是您的工作（我们不会在本文中讨论这些操作是什么，因为它们可能因方案而异），并且尽量不要这样做许多同态乘法。这听起来让你感到害怕吗？那你的陪伴很好。\n\n注意：有一种方法可以绕过固定的噪声上限——“[自举](https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/easy-fhe.pdf)”——它具有自己的一套复杂性和权衡取舍。\n\n### 构建完全同态加密方案需要什么？\n\n所有 FHE 方案都使用一种特定类型的[后量子密码术](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography)，称为[格密码术](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography)。好消息是 FHE 可以抵抗来自量子计算机的攻击（如果我们应该关注这样的事情是完全不同的话题）。坏消息是，即使您以前参加过密码学入门课程，您也可能不熟悉格密码学。\n\n简单地说，晶格位于实向量空间（也称为 R^n）内，可以使用向量和矩阵表示（您绝对应该熟悉！）。\n\nFHE 方案可以根据它们对计算的建模方式分为 3 种类型（如果对更高级的技术细节感兴趣，请参阅[此演示文稿）。](http://homomorphicencryption.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CCS-HE-Tutorial-Slides.pdf)第一种类型将计算建模为**布尔电路**（即位）。第二种类型将计算建模为**模算术**（即“时钟”算术）。第三种也是最后一种将计算建模为**浮点运算**。\n\n**计算模型                                      适合                                                                                                   计划**\\*\n\nBoolean                             Number

Machine Learning              [CKKS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/421.pdf)\n\n这些方案的名称通常来自创建它的作者的姓氏。例如，“BGV”来自作者 Brakerski、Gentry 和 Vaikuntanathan。\n\n* 并非详尽的方案清单！我刚刚列出了一些知名的。\n\n### 为什么我们关心这个？\n\n公共分类账上的私人交易（例如区块链）。私人交易方案允许用户安全地将数字货币发送给某个接收者，而无需在公共分布式账本上透露发送给任何人（除了预期的接收者）的金额。这与比特币等加密货币形成鲜明对比，其中交易和余额都是公共信息。\n\n我们假设一个完全同态（公钥）加密方案。所有加密都是针对接收方的密钥完成的。\n\n1  发件人想要将t令牌发送给收件人。发送t者在接收者的公钥下加密。\n\n2  发件人Encrypt(t)在公共分类账上发布。\n\n3  请注意Encrypt(t) + Encrypt(Receiver's balance) = Encrypt(Receiver's balance after performing the transaction).\n\n这可以扩展到更有趣的金融应用，例如拍卖、投票和衍生品。将计算建模为模算术的 FHE 方案可能最适合此类应用。\n\n注意：要使其在实践中发挥作用，还需要一些其他加密工具（例如[零知识证明](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/27/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer/)）。。\n\n\\*\\*私人机器学习。\\*\\*在过去的几年里，人们越来越关注我们如何能够从数据中“学习”（通过机器学习），同时仍然保持数据本身的私密性。FHE 是一种可以帮助我们实现这一目标的工具。与之前的应用相比，我们可能需要一个 FHE 方案，将计算建模为*浮点运算*。\n\n该领域的一项著名工作是[Crypto-Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6181)，它结合了（顾名思义）FHE 和[神经网络](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)，以允许外包机器学习。当人们谈论“外包机器学习”时，通常描述的环境是数据*所有者*想要了解他的数据，但不愿意与提供机器学习模型的公司公开分享他的数据。因此，数据所有者使用 FHE 加密他的数据，并允许机器学习公司在加密数据集上运行他们的模型。\n\n同态加密并不是解决这个问题的唯一方法；[差分隐私](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy#:\\~:text=Differential%20privacy%20is%20a%20system,about%20individuals%20in%20the%20dataset)是一个密切相关的主题，在过去几年中引起了很多关注。差分隐私比密码学更多是统计数据，因为它不直接涉及加密/解密。它通过在清晰的数据中添加噪声来工作，同时仍然保证可以从嘈杂的数据集中获得有意义的见解。Apple 是一家[据称使用](https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Differential_Privacy_Overview.pdf)差异隐私来了解您的行为同时保持一定程度隐私的大公司。\n\n### 为什么 FHE 还没有起飞：太空中的挑战\n\n到目前为止，这一切听起来都很棒，但我一直忽略了一些问题。\n\n### 许多不同的方案（也就是每个人都说不同的语言）\n\n您已经决定要使用 FHE——太好了！以下是现在需要考虑的一些注意事项：\n\n**你想如何建模计算？**\n\nFHE 以三种方式之一对计算进行建模——布尔电路、模运算或浮点运算。[希望您需要哪种模型是显而易见的，因为除了像这样](http://homomorphicencryption.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CCS-HE-Tutorial-Slides.pdf)的介绍性资源之外没有多少资源可以帮助您。不过，这个问题可能是您最不关心的问题。\n\n如果我对属于我需要的相同计算模型的 FHE 方案有多个选项（例如，在 BGV 与 BFV 之间进行选择以进行模运算），该怎么办？\n\n嗯，很不幸。没有太多工作可以解释具有相同计算模型的不同方案之间的权衡。您可能必须使用各种方案并使用它们来实现您的特定用例以确定哪个是最好的。您可以尝试阅读一些非常复杂的研究论文（例如[this ）。](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/493.pdf)\n\n基于不同计算模型的方案是否表现相同？\n有点但不是真的。不同的方案倾向于使用不同的技术来控制效率和噪声增长，您需要了解这些技术才能成功使用 FHE。此外，这些方案具有您需要了解的不同参数才能正确设置它们。这些参数不仅影响方案的安全性（这是密码学中给定的），还影响您可以使用的明文种类、您可以执行的同态计算的数量以及方案的整体性能。\n\n不同的方案完全兼容吗？\n这张照片\\*有帮助吗？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HjXfRK6TJ_J0zmAORZkEM.png?height=589&width=1000&&&size=medium)\n\nFHE 之间存在的关系，但要了解这种关系，您还需要详细了解 FHE 的各种工作原理。\n\n有很多选择真是赞了！\n\n但在以下情况下并不好：\n\n您不知道 FHE 方案之间的这些不同或方案之间的关系，您必须真正从大量精力来理解一个单一的方案获得的一个方案，不能在多种不同的知识转移中并学习一个新方案计算模型下）\n\n### 潜在的解决方案：\n\n1. 更新和改进基准测试工作\n\n一个大问题是缺乏最新的基准测试工作。当我们不知道一个实现对另一个实现如何执行时（在同一台机器上，对于一组特定的可比参数），很难推荐针对特定用例使用哪种 FHE 方案。FHE 库变化很快，纳入了新的优化，因此 1-2 年前的基准测试工作很快就失去了相关性（例如2018 年[的](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/589.pdf)BFV 方案的各种实现）。\n\n2  更好的资源/指南来解释方案之间的权衡\n\n如果没有对不同方案和库的最新基准测试，就不可能提供好的资源来解释 FHE 方案在实践中的权衡。有一些演示文稿（例如[这个](http://homomorphicencryption.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CCS-HE-Tutorial-Slides.pdf)）试图阐明 FHE 中 3 种计算模型之间的差异。但是，如果您尝试使用*相同*的计算模型在*不同的方案之间进行选择，那么没有任何好的资源可以提供帮助。*\n\n3能够在不同 FHE 方案之间移动（即互操作性）\n\n如果不同的 FHE 方案之间存在某种互操作性，则更容易理解这些方案是如何相互关联的。关于这个主题的学术著作是[CHIMERA](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/758)，它提供了在 TFHE（布尔）、BFV（模运算）和 HEAAN（浮点运算）之间切换的框架。不幸的是，这项工作需要非常强大的抽象代数背景以及对所使用的所有 FHE 方案的熟悉程度。解释不同类型方案之间关系的更易于访问的资源会很好（“类型”是指 3 种类型的计算模型——布尔、模算术、浮点算术）。\n\n* 图片来自[CHIMERA](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/758)的论文\n\n### 效率（比看起来与更复杂的问题）\n\n如果您大部分是 FHE 的人“并询问他们为什么不使用 FHE，他们通常会说哦，它可以解决不高”之类的事情。换而言之，我觉得每个人都似乎有点懒惰，它大大增加了个人的助益问题。因为它使用了加密的私人密码，这并不意味着人都可以真正有效地加密。情况下，应该使用较低的技术。\n\n除了个人的声音之外，我们将您必须考虑的一些因素，以提高 FHE 的观察效果。\n\n一些 FHE 允许您对加密执行真正的任意数量的计算。但是，许多方案允许一定的同态执行数量。执行后，不能保证会成功执行。因此，FHE方案只允许 100 次同态乘法（注意：加法在 FHE 方案中“容易”，而得到乘法要困难立即）。通常如果我们试行进行第 101 次同态乘法，则不能保证的密文可以同样是允许真正的各种方案的多种性能计算出你的性能差的表现。\n\n你需要多少明文空间？大不同。如果您用密文表示账户余额并且需要确保他们不会“环绕”模数，这可能特别重要。\n\n\\*\\*您是否要对许多不同的明文或密文（即“SIMD”样式计算）执行相同的操作？\\*\\*一些 FHE 方案可以利用“ [SIMD](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/133.pdf) ”风格的操作同时对多个明文或密文执行相同的操作。如果这种并行化对您有用，您应该考虑探索提供此功能的方案和库。SIMD 风格的操作，如果使用得当，确实可以提高效率。\n\n\\*\\*您可以接受哪些密钥大小？\\*\\*例如，使用[TFHE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/421.pdf)，您需要在方案中访问的某些密钥可能是 1 GB 大！就时间而言，性能可能不错，但您却需要存储一把巨大的钥匙。\n\n\\*\\*你对大密文没问题吗？\\*\\*使用 FHE 时，密文扩展可能非常糟糕。再次查看[TFHE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/421.pdf)，明文到密文的扩展为 10,000:1，这是可接受的安全级别（100 位）。\n\n在性能方面对您来说最重要的是什么？您不能在 FHE 中“可能拥有一切”，因此确定您需要什么想要什么计算。可能你需要一个很大的明文空间。在选择 FHE 方案的时候，需要考虑所有这些小问题。\n\n**潜在的解决方案：**\n\n1\\.硬件加速\n\n一些 FHE 方案可以使用[GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit)进行加速；此类库的示例包括[nuFHE](https://github.com/nucypher/nufhe)和[cuFHE](https://github.com/vernamlab/cuHE)。加速 FHE 方案的其他努力包括使用[FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array)（例如[HEAX](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09731.pdf)）。[HEAX](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09731.pdf)与 CKKS 方案（浮点算法）配合使用，可以根据具体操作产生 12 倍到 250 倍以上的性能加速。不幸的是，该论文表明基于 FPGA 的方法对于 BFV 方案（整数算术）并不那么成功。\n\n*2.改进FHE方案的研究突破*\n\n说起来容易做起来难。\n\n### 可用性（没有）\n\n前面的讨论将我们引向了最后一点——可用性。FHE*对*初学者不友好，*对*用户不友好，*当然也*对密码学家不友好。对于缺乏数学或密码学背景的工程师来说，确实没有任何可用性。\n\n大多数 FHE 库都需要深入了解底层加密方案才能正确有效地使用。另一位密码学家将使用 FHE 描述为类似于编写程序集——好的实现和出色的实现在性能上存在巨大差异。如果没有强大的底层方案背景，涉足诸如[HElib之类的库可能会令人生畏。](https://github.com/homenc/HElib)\n\n***情况真的那么糟糕吗？***\n\n将我们简要介绍使 FHE 异常用户友好的问题。\n\n* 参数设置很重要。例如，在[BFV](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/blob/master/native/examples/1_bfv_basics.cpp)（比 BGV 方案更简单）中，我们必须设置多项式模数、系数模数和明文模数。设置这些参数需要了解它们如何影响方案（例如，您计划进行哪种操作，多少操作）。此外，要了解参数的含义，您必须学习一些关于[环](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics))的基本理论（抽象代数）。我们目前无法抽象出这些问题；这只是使用 FHE 方案所必需的。\n* 公钥加密只有 3 种主要算法（`KeyGen`, `Encrypt`, `Decrypt`），但对于具有附加操作的 FHE 方案来说并不那么简单（方案之间也有所不同）。因为您需要了解*如何*以及*何时*使用某些操作，所以使用 FHE 需要您自己培养直觉。\n* 为了培养良好的直觉，您需要使用该方案....但是有些库的文档很少。\n* 理解一种类型的方案可能无法很好地转化为理解另一种类型的方案（这里按类型，我指的是三种不同的计算模型）。\n\n  > *那么……我现在准备好使用 FHE 了吗？*\n\n  可能不会，但您肯定已经准备好查看一些库了！\n\n潜在的解决方案：\n\n1. 标准化工作\n\n   在这里，我们的意思是明确使用哪些参数、提供哪些功能等的标准。\n\n   标准化工作目前由开放的行业/政府/学术联盟“同态加密标准化”牵头。他们已经发布了关于同态加密的安全性和 API 标准的提案草案。\n2. 更人性化的库和示例\n\n   一个例子是Microsoft 的 SEAL，它有一个非常有指导意义的示例部分。希望更多的库会花时间创建用户友好的文档和示例。\n3. 潜在的编译器\n\n   FHE 社区中关于创建编译器或一些中间表示以使 FHE 更易于使用的讨论已经有一段时间了。[Cingulata](https://github.com/CEA-LIST/Cingulata)就是这样一种尝试。不幸的是，这些编译器中的许多都会显着降低速度（与直接使用 FHE 库相比）。。\n\n## 这一切有什么意义？\n\n> ***不是你，是FHE。***\n\n高级编程语言已经抽象出多种计算机工作方式的复杂性，在使用时，没有“高级语言”的类似物性。 FHE 对目前并没有很好的使用效果，FHE 还准备好在制作过程中使用非密码制作制作。\n\n非常看好别人 FHE 的未来。，但是现在，需要指出 FHE 的功效（给定图书馆和使我定的）更有用的地方。\n\n给我看代码！如果以前没有使用 FHE 的经验，我们建议您从您的用户更友好的库开始，SEAL。\n\n一些例如 SEAL 和 PALI 提供了各种类型的 HE 方案。\n\n**计算模型可用库**\n\n```\n        Boolean                                      [TFHE](https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe), [nuFHE](https://github.com/nucypher/nufhe),

In a mail sent to its customers on Thursday the company voluntarily filed petitions for Chapter 11 reorganization and used the same firm as Voyager Digital for its bankruptcy proceedings. It is unclear what will happen with users’ funds at this stage, given there may be a [$1.2 billion hole in the firm’s balance sheet](https://cointelegraph.com/news/celsius-bankruptcy-filings-show-a-company-in-deep-trouble). Earlier in the day, Celsius closed off the last of its Defi debts owed to Compound, Aave and Maker, reducing its initial debt of $820 million to just $0.013 over the course of a month. What is still unknown, however, will be the fate of depositors who still have their assets locked up on the lending platform. Neither the company nor its CEO Alex Mashinsky has made any public comments about whether depositors will receive any percentage of their funds back.\n\n[![Image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe063d75e-b651-4992-92d5-71011e3587a4\\_1723x965.jpeg \"Image\")](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe063d75e-b651-4992-92d5-71011e3587a4\\_1723x965.jpeg)\n\n## 3AC founder breaks month long silence, plays victim card.\n\nSu Zhu, co-founder of Singapore-based crypto venture capital firm Three Arrows Capital (3AC), returned to Twitter after nearly a month of inactivity.

In this recap we share the opportunities and challenges in bringing innovative governance models to offline communities.**\n\nCity3’s mission is to create more just socio-economic systems powered by crypto for existing real world communities. As part of this effort, we recently partnered with [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) to bring quadratic funding to the city of Oakland.\n\n[Quadratic funding](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000) (QF) is a mathematically and democratically optimal way to fund public goods, where matching capital is distributed based on a quadratic formula that makes the number of contributors matter more than the amount raised.\n\n![Quadratic funding explained (EOS)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8CJudW5yeHroHo9FiCaH2.png?height=415&width=768)\n\nWe originally set out with three broad questions outlined in our [announcement](https://mirror.xyz/0xcity3.eth/8ZgDDZcixWbLW9Jb79Vuc5illbB5IiKU-c-NyCfabEQ):\n\n* Is supporting an organization that you care about an effective incentive for someone to set up a web3 wallet?\n* What can quadratic funding tell us about the way people value civic organizations?\n* Will small dollar contributors feel they’ve made a significant contribution?\n\nIn this article we highlight two major takeaways from the experience:\n\n1. **To optimize positive results, we should identify the types of decisions and/or public goods that thrive when QF is applied.** We recommend a stronger alignment with the two problems QF is designed to address: information asymmetry and the free rider problem.\n2. **Governance experiments need to prioritize building trust, accessibility and diverse representation.** Funding real-world public goods comes with its own set of challenges, but existing tools are not designed for offline communities. This is an open call for more QF projects “in the wild”.\n\n# Overview and results\n\nDuring [Gitcoin Grants Round 14](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gr14-results/) which ran from 8-23 June 2022, 7 Oakland nonprofits raised $3,799.07 from 454 contributions and 249 unique contributors. $15,000 has been set aside for matching, funded jointly by city3 and the [Oakland Fund for Public Innovation](https://www.oaklandfund.org/).\n\n![Gitcoin’s quadratic funding local cause round for Oakland](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eh6o2W2RW1rMLSWhG70zd.png?height=1488&width=1830)\n\nAlthough contributing to the round was open to anyone, we hosted a series of virtual governance workshops aimed at assisting locals with setting up a non-custodial crypto wallet and Github account, and then navigating Gitcoin’s checkout process.\n\nDuring these workshops we saw firsthand how most web3 tools are simply not designed for offline communities, let alone mobile-first users.\n\nYet despite the friction, several residents expressed surprise that crypto could be used in this way. For those interacting with crypto for the first time, there was something viscerally meaningful about seeing a $5 donation get matched with $30 for an organization in their community. Those already familiar with crypto expressed a desire to see more of these initiatives:\n\n> *“I am currently working full time for a DAO, and it's cool how global it is, but would love to get more involved \\[with\\] local web3/crypto efforts.”*\n\nExact numbers on local participation are not available, but by combining Gitcoin’s profile location data with the number of people who attended our governance workshops and/or responded to our feedback surveys, we estimate that 20% of contributors were Oakland residents.\n\nClearly, there exists some critical threshold at which representation either justifies or undermines the entire quadratic funding process. This also highlights why education and accessibility are so important, and ought to be considered integral to any effective quadratic funding program.\n\nConsider a hypothetical grants round with higher-stakes decisions. While outside funding might still be useful to maximize funds raised, would we still weigh votes equally between locals and non-locals? We’re excited about the early although untested solutions that attempt to solve this, such as intersectional social data (see [RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/2019-10-24-uh78r5/)) or geo-spatial weighting (see [Astral Protocol](https://docs.astral.global/) or [Foam](https://foam.space/)).\n\n# Where does quadratic funding matter most?\n\nIn their 2020 paper, *[Building Radical Cities](https://assets.website-files.com/5d253237e31f051057dc0a2b/5f04beb70336ec0cc37ceff9_Building%20Radical%20Charter%20Cities.pdf)*, Paul Healy and Matt Prewitt identify QF as one of several mechanisms to better calibrate political expression at the city level. QF has been a popular choice for distributing public grants in the cryptosphere. For example, Gitcoin Grants Round 14 saw record breaking numbers: over 44,000 contributors donated $1.7M which will be boosted by a $3.2M matching pool.\n\nJust as QF supports “long tail” crypto projects – novel, small initiatives that otherwise would not be able to accumulate startup capital – we set out to test whether the same could be applied to long tail “real-world” projects, particularly civic organizations that play a critical role in serving their communities. While several offline projects have raised funds with Gitcoin in the past, this was the first time matching was targeted at a specific geographic community.\n\nWe are incredibly proud to have worked with Oakland nonprofits doing important work ranging from tech mentorship to supporting gang-impacted youth. And while we believe that nothing bad happens when impactful community organizations get money they deserve, in hindsight we do question whether funding local nonprofits was the most useful application of this governance tool.\n\nThe benefit of QF lies not so much in matching large sums of capital to small donations as in surfacing the nuance of community preferences in order to produce the best possible allocation outcome for decisions involving competing public goods.\n\nHere we turn to the two problems QF is most cited to solve:\n\n1. **QF solves an information problem.** In a world of scarce resources, the government (or more broadly, the public) does not always know how much of a certain good to provide\n2. **QF solves a free rider problem.** Those who benefit from public goods often underpay or don’t pay at all because there is little incentive to make small, individual contributions.\n\nWe believe we could have done a better job of scoping the problem space and designing our QF program to directly address these areas. For our next experiment, we may consider these questions as part of our decision making framework:\n\n1. What are some examples of competing public goods that we find difficult to prioritize in the local city budget?\n2. What are some areas of public resource allocation that people frequently complain feels unrepresentative and/or unfair?\n3. What are some alternative governance models already being applied in the community (e.g. participatory budgeting, neighborhood council advisory boards) – are they willing to try a new approach?\n\n# A call for more quadratic funding “in the wild”\n\nSome of our biggest coordination challenges exist at the city level. While there is growing interest in new governance models enabled by web3 technology, we haven’t seen these implemented outside of [a few examples](https://twitter.com/0xcity3/status/1534576283232763905). In other words, whether quadratic funding is indeed democratically and economically optimal is yet to be tested at scale.\n\nWe see a massive opportunity to combine the best of tokenized governance with decisions that tangibly affect the communities we live in. Several organizations are already doing work that makes this possible:\n\n* [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)\n* [Endaoment](https://endaoment.org/)\n* [Change](https://getchange.io/)\n* [RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/)\n* [Clr.fund](https://clr.fund/#/)\n* [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/)\n\nWe hope to see more crypto tools designed to serve real-world communities. For this to happen, we simultaneously need to invest in [pre-existing social infrastructure](https://otherinter.net/research/local-gov/) that has a long legacy of making our cities more just, more livable and more resilient.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe believe that QF is only as impactful as it is accessible and only as useful as it solves critical problems that could not be solved through simpler means.\n\nThe Oakland local cause round was the first of many programs city3 will be launching to bridge web3 innovation with real-world community needs. Just as crypto crowdfunding has expanded possibilities for seeding public goods, we have a unique opportunity to shift resource allocation within our cities.\n\n[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xcity3) to stay up to date with our work.", "timestamp": 1658170166, "digest": "3mWS8yQnErrG60crGKTl3pKb6Xe46WCPTIaq9V9xvvw", "contributor": "0x27F2a7D8ce449C9A1E35Fc859Aa0d1053f5E47D3"}

{"id": "zkb0UM21EqHsrvx3mnQJmwMLKRhCjmVbDmPabwSxKDc", "title": "What DAOs Can Learn from Rainbow — 50yrs of Decentralized Autonomous Gathering", "body": "## The Immense Potential of DAOs\n\nFor an in-depth yet beginner friendly introduction to DAOs, please check out [this NYTimes article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/what-are-daos.html).\n\nHistorically, centralized power seemed to have obviously ‘won’ against the decentralized crowd —— we have witnessed how local faiths overpowered by organized religions, co-ops outcompeted by conglomerates, indigenous tribes eliminated by empires. We live in a world where profit incentives aren’t aligned with the common wealth and resources are shamefully extracted to maximize profit for individual gains.\n\nWithout doubt, technologies are best used to serve humanity’s overall well-being. Blockchain solutions can be used to realign our incentives, create equitable and transparent systems to avoid corruption and exploitation. The DAO space has huge potential to create **community-oriented autonomous templates to fundamentally decentralize the way humans operate** in order to **create abundance for all.**\n\n![Homemade meme about DAOs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TrgE2iuoFa1Fvi7OIiyOx.png?height=1011&width=1166)\n\nWithin a system that is transparent and fair, people would operate better because they ‘can’t do bad’ instead of ‘won’t do bad’. The Gitcoin’s theory on [ImpactDAOs](https://store.gitcoin.co/products/impactdao-book-digital-edition) did a deep dive into this philosophy.\n\nIt is worth noting that DAOs are still in its infancy, most DAOs are in its process of figuring out the best suited ways to govern. Many DAOs have very long and redundant execution processes as a protection against centralized dictatorship which often led to inefficiency and bureaucracy. Being born at the heart of the crypto industry, DAOs can be filled with pyramid scams and inflated values.\n\nBecause of the immaturity and capital-infested nature of crypto, learnings on the art of gathering and coordination may best come from outside of the DAO space. Humans have been organizing in swift and ingenue ways centuries before blockchain technology appeared.\n\nDAOs are schelling points for strangers to gather around a shared mission & vision and collectively accumulate resources to achieve this shared goal. —— This is exactly what [Rainbow Gathering](https://rainbowfamilygatherings.net/) has achieved in the past 50 years without blockchain.\n\n## What is the Rainbow Gathering?\n\n![Pic from SDBP Radio](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NHzQChJZjYJaW7Pb2-dou.png?height=542&width=880)\n\n*Special Thanks to [@mycobici](https://twitter.com/mycobici) for encouraging me to go to the 50 years Rainbow Gathering and drawing the analogy between Rainbow and DAOs. Special Thanks to [@imu](https://www.instagram.com/zenthebus/) for sending me courage, love and the Rainbow Gathering coordinate. 💕*\n\nI heard about the rainbow gathering from an off-grid eco village at the southern tip of Hilo, Hawaii.\n\n“It’s a gathering about peace, love and generosity. It is completely free to go and everything was shared in a gift-based society”, said someone from the eco village, who at the time refuses to have a cellphone or wear shoes.\n\n“There is no tickets, no social media. Location changes every year mostly in different national forests and the only way to find out is through word of mouth.\n\nThe gatherings also happen all around the world. Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Costa Rica, Mexico… and here on the Big Island! The main gathering is in the US every year, the main international gathering rotates around the world, and there are regionals happening all the time.”\n\nRainbow Gathering started in 1972, it is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Gathering) as a gathering where people ‘congregate in remote forests around the world for one or more weeks at a time with the stated intention of living a shared ideology of peace, harmony, freedom, and respect.’\n\nThe first gathering happened in Colorado where twenty thousand people faced police roadblocks, threatened [civil disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience), and were allowed onto [National Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Forest) land. It has spontaneously become a yearly tradition ever since.\n\nIn this anti-capitalist and anti-materialist world, people put up temporary cabins and tents, campfires and water filters, shared everything in a mutually respectful way. Regardless of cultural background or race, people shared a common language that is peace and love.\n\n![Pic of Rainbow from Sky-Hi News](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z2Savl-0dyYT_81p5EB0F.png?height=637&width=1024)\n\nIt is worth iterating that there are natural problems that come with the gathering, I do not wish to say that everything happens with the Rainbow community is always positive. The concerns about Rainbow Gathering will be claimed in the section in the end.\n\n## How Decentralized?\n\nThe gathering has no single leader, no corporation and usually no money involved except for some donations. All organizers gather and find common grounds cooperatively. Anyone that felt the urge to contribute can volunteer to organize since helping hands are always needed.\n\nAt each gathering, organizers would arrive weeks in advance to pave roads, study the terrain and plan out the locations. Different kitchen crews would put up camps with cookware, shelves, washing stations, toilet holes and sometimes showers. Individuals usually gather around the kitchens, enjoy the meals and help out when they can.\n\n![Reverse Osmosis Connected to River Water](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/By8WYji7f2M2sDBxgsCII.jpg?height=716&width=1000)\n\nEach camp has its own culture and quite unique characteristics. In the 50yr’s gathering in Colorado, **Instant Soup** served vegan soup 24/7 and always had elderly folks singing around campfire every night. **Wanna Burn** was a kitchen organized by nomad performers and fire spinners and they just felt like lovely pirates. I was told by the crew if anyone took out a cellphone at the kitchen it would get smashed. **Kids Village** as the name suggested were a fun space for kids to run around with small bridges and swings.\n\n![Pic from Atlas Obscura](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kqlMdmqaYgMyuQv4guELZ.png?height=2474&width=3235)\n\nEach kitchen dug its ‘compost’ holes for organic matters and buried them after they’re full. ‘Shitters’ were dug at various locations and ashes and dirt were put on them to avoid flies and diseases. All non-organic trash were carried out by volunteers as people started to leave. Crates from recycle companies were placed at the entrance of the gathering.\n\nAt the center you can find **Info Camp** where all info and activities can be found on bulletin boards, medical tents where student volunteers treated the sick and injured.\n\n![Map about the 2022 Gathering in Colorado](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z-ids5g5ZGXDsci0ACZ1q.png?height=1097&width=843)\n\nDuring the gathering, various events were celebrated and projects were made. On July 4th, everyone gathered in the main lawn and prayed in silence for world peace. People put together sweat lodges, had meetings about permaculture and eco villages. There was yoga and Tai-chi practices, poetry nights, music circles, fire dancing… Basically, if enough people want to make something happen, it would happen.\n\n## Unanimous Consensus\n\n![Rainbow Family Pic from Wikipedia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PWXQIX4NRhW0hSyHjU62x.jpg?height=900&width=1200)\n\nThe most important decision every gathering is where to have Rainbow next year. This decision is made by the ‘Vision Circle’ which is usually held at the end of each gathering. Anyone who shows up at the Vision Circle would may speak and hold voting power regardless of their expertise. Unanimous consensus is required for any decisions to be made, the Vision Circle sometimes take days to complete in order to reach consensus.\n\nI sat at the Vision Circle for hours just to observe the process, it reminds me of filibustering in politics. Although the difference is that anyone who wanted to speak can speak, and there is absolutely no interruption to anyone’s speech.\n\nMajority of people do not feel the need to participate in this decision making process. Since the location rotates every year across the US, it seems like a natural flow of evenly distributed choices.\n\nI do believe Vision Circle exists more for the spirit of making sure everyone’s voice is heard. **The nature of unanimous consensus symbolizes that individual satisfaction is less important than group cohesion and harmony, which in itself is a quite beautiful spirit for any organization.** There will always be someone dissatisfied in the end, but everyone still celebrates when a decision was made.\n\n## How Autonomous?\n\nThe idea of Rainbow got brought to different corners of the world by people attended the first few gatherings. It has shown that decentralized social movements can be ‘templatized’. Once the formula has been play-tested, it can be ‘forked’ to different places and adopted to its local culture.\n\n**The formula is intuitive and the message is simple and powerful.**\n\nJust like how [Maslow summarized universal structure of basic human needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html#:\\~:text=From%20the%20bottom%20of%20the,attend%20to%20needs%20higher%20up.), Rainbow summarized universal solutions about gathering in the forest.\n\nBasic survival practices such as: choosing location with the right climate and source of water, setting up kitchen with chopped wood, preparing filters for river water, digging ‘shitters’ and burying feces with ashes and soil so diseases don’t spread, having event calendar visible in central info station, having safe words and other codes of conducts… All these formula are simple enough to be put into a handbook that can be carried cross boarder and language and learned quite intuitively, most of them might already be known by experienced outdoor survivors.\n\nJust a good formula is not enough without a strong motivation to gather of course. Getting a group of unmotivated people to do things is harder than making pigs fly. For Rainbow, the motive to gather comes is simple and powerful, it is that **everybody is welcome in this gift-based society of love and peace** —— a message quite hard to say no to.\n\nAs long as people feel the need to gather, people would find ways to do so. The gathering is very much an organic and natural formation. Nothing is forced, nothing is paid for, nothing is for show, nothing is for sale. People gathered and united around a common mission in a completely authentic and compassionate way.\n\nJust like how songs and stories spread across continents way before the birth of telegraph or internet, just like a good meme, penetrating through firewalls and cultural differences, whenever an art form or a message resonates with people deeply and fundamentally, it will flow effortlessly for as far as it can.\n\n## The Giving Culture as a Schelling Point\n\nMany would say Rainbow is a counter culture movement, it is everything ‘default society’ is not. The Rainbow culture is simple enough to spread far across cultures and borders, yet profound enough to create amazing impact on individuals.\n\nIt’s quite fascinating to have hiked miles into deep forest to be offered massages and served organic vegan soup for as many times as you want, none of which cost anything.\n\nWe talk about ‘flipping the game theory’ and ‘incentive alignment’ a lot in the DAO space, and the folks at Rainbow did it in such a simple way ---- a demographic that supposedly has little wealth proved that achieving abundance with very little is possible. It really does make you rethink about post scarcity differently. Even thou it might not be long term sustainable and comes with its own set of problems, there are still things we can learn from.\n\nParadigm shift need to come from mental shift, or as the new age hippies would call it: a consciousness shift. I do believe that with any emerging communication or governance technology, **the cultural spirit would be at the center of any social movement.** There would be no social change without a mentality shift free of existing construct of exploitations and unhealthy competitions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nJust like a knife can be used to cut butter or to kill people, the technology can be misused if it wasn’t intentional. Just because DAOs share the same technology doesn’t mean they share the same principle of operations. DAOs can be ‘central banks’, they can be outright valueless scams, or continued exploitations with cycles of pump and dump.\n\n**We aim to create systems where people ‘can’t act bad’, but it’s also crucial to create a culture where people ‘don’t want to act bad’. These two aspects, the spirit and the form, should be treated with equal importance in order to co-create something beautiful. That’s when DAOs meet Rainbow.**\n\nDAOs are by nature community oriented, and the community would seed the culture of the DAO. I believe [DAOs have potential to change how we coordinate and operate in many ways](https://blog.aragon.org/10-industries-being-disrupted-by-daos/), with a precondition that their shared mission is **simple and clearly defined, with authentic passion adhering to one’s intrinsic value**, and hopefully, oriented towards creating better future for all living beings. ❤️\n\n## Disclaimer —— Warnings About Rainbow ⚠️\n\nWithout over glorifying Rainbow, it’s important to mention the negative aspects of its culture.\n\nBecause everyone is welcomed, there is no guarantee that everybody at the gathering will behave in a mutually respectful way. Because it is free, there is a natural influx of people who live on the streets without homes. Because of its emphasis on personal freedom, there is always an abundance of illegal drugs.\n\nBecause of the anti-capitalistic mentality as its spirit, many people choose to be **anti-productivity** as well. Lots of people choose not to work or do anything constructive, and it became a gateway to indulgence in hedonism and anti-accomplishment mentality. The press and rumors about Rainbow are also mostly negative for all these reasons.\n\n**Here’s my observation at the gathering:**\n\nGoing to the gathering by myself for the first time, I was unsure of what to expect and was on high alert, very soon I relaxed and felt right at home. I’ve had many fun conversations with various characters of all ages and cultural backgrounds, gypsy flow artists from Europe, qi-gong masters from China, energy healers from Israel, farmers from Iowa, intentional village organizers from Tennessee, nomads from Bosnia, musicians from Turkey… It was a fun and diverse group of people, I felt accepted, respected and most of the time enjoyed everyone’s company.\n\nThere was an abundance of psychedelic drugs and weed being shared at the gathering. Most of them given out for free to people who ask for them. Occasionally you would see people tripping hard and acting ‘over the top’, however, comparing to a regular music festival, I would say it actually has a lot less of non-sober people — which was a total surprise for me.\n\nRainbow was a lot more family oriented compare to regular music festivals. There were many kids and elderly, many people I met brought their parents. Preparing and sharing group meals and singing in music circles were the majority of the activities. I would personally bring my parents to a Rainbow Gathering but probably not Burning Man.\n\nThe only ‘iffy thing’ that I observed was when someone looked like in high adrenaline said another ‘crazy’ person was trying to attack him and he dodged away. It did remind me that this was an event that everyone is welcome and everything is allowed so we do have to be cautious.\n\nAlthough it might be inevitable to have zero trash and disturbance to the environment given the scale of the gathering, I do think the organizers and volunteers did their best to protect local environment, they would spend weeks cleaning up everything after everyone leaves, ‘putting rocks back where they’re supposed to be’, said Scottie, an Urban designer from Yale who’s been organizing Rainbow for decades, ’The location was strategically chosen to be far away from river sources to protect the local water’s ecosystem.’ Everyone was also informed to only use dead trees for campfire wood and structure building.\n\n## More Conclusions!\n\nIn the end I want to say that this post is not suggesting that if everyone becomes hippies and gather in the woods we would solve all world’s problems, nor that Rainbow is an absolute golden formula for DAOs to learn from.\n\nThe Rainbow Gathering is a formula that worked for decades, with a simple and beautiful message. It exists because it needs to exist and it will continue to exist as long as enough people make it happen, it will always be at the cross of the supply and demand curve, and the longer it goes, the more experienced it would be at decentralized autonomous gathering.\n\nAfter hearing many negative comments and press about Rainbow I was glad to experience it myself and make my own distinction. I’m eternally grateful that something simple and beautiful can be experienced with no barrier of entry, and see people take care of each other with so much generosity and unconditional love. I have restored some faith in humanity, and felt encouraged to pursuit what I’m called to do ---- using technology to serve the holistic well being of humans and create abundance for all. 🌈\n\n![Rainbow Gathering 2022, Main Circle](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xPa-dPjMhfUoe_xtWE0I5.jpg?height=602&width=1200)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658170667, "digest": "o62XoLqkCWxs0T0n9c4hWwlyBJnaQcfFfTVg4QqCJt0", "contributor": "0x79A99912f8890DB72EEF59dd92Baa0935D133856"}

For example, three Arrows Captial (3AC) worth $2.8B was liquidated, and co-founders ran away while filing a lawsuit to against their own company. But this will only be the tip of the iceberg for the crypto industry at large. On one side are those who see opportunity in cryptocurrency; on the other are those intent on destroying it. I will share some changes that will affect the blockchain and cryptocurrency in general as a result of December’s massive purchase in virtual assets by a third-party organization known as “Crypto VC”.\n\n[https://twitter.com/DrSoldmanGachs/status/1547173025673785346](https://twitter.com/DrSoldmanGachs/status/1547173025673785346)\n\n**December’s massive purchase in virtual assets by a third party organization known as “Crypto VC”**\nCrypto VC isn't a new concept. Back in December 2017, there were VCs were blow up ever since.\n\nFor the first time in history, a public person has bought and sold virtual assets in person. This is amounting to the largest private sale of virtual assets to date. This transaction, which took place in New York City on December 3rd, marks a new milestone in the history of digital assets. The total investment amount involved in this deal is believed to be in the range of $200 million – $300 million. The motivation for this investment can be found in the style of the investments made: most notably, efforts by the investors to clean up their act.\n\n**Davan Megawal and the crypto VC scam**\nBack in May, One97 Capital – the investment vehicle of digital assets manager and investor Davan Megawal – bought complete control of IcoAward, a cryptocurrency fund focused on issuing digital currency. But this is just one incident in a long list of misdirection, misdirection, and misdirection by the fund management. While the bought-and-then-sold-on activities of Megawal and the fund managers are not covered in the facts about the purchase of IcoAward, the activities of the distributed ledger technology (DLT) startup Alexa, which was the core of the deal, are.\n\n**The Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Scams of 2017**\nBlockchain and cryptocurrency are inextricably linked. The first is a technology behind a wide range of industries – financial services, media, tech, insurance, etc. The second is a new and emerging branch of information technology that can support these technologies. The blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and public digital ledger that can record transactions efficiently and securely. The distributed ledger technologies – MLS, PPC, and SPV – are the latest in a long line of techniques that have been developed to support this new technology.\n\n**How to Protect Yourself From VC Investments**\nThere are a few things that you can do to protect yourself from potential conflicts of interest in investments. Some people are going to benefit from investing in companies that have ties to certain developers and investors in the blockchain and cryptocurrency fields. A good example is Facebook’s relationship with Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of the Bitcoin Foundation, which has been a prominent voice in calling for an end to the digital gold standard. But when Andreea Barys, a former employee at Facebook, became involved in the development of the DAO, a project that was closely associated with Buterin and other prominent blockchain and cryptocurrency developers, she became a prime example of potential conflict of interest.\n\n**What is a Crypto VC Investment?**\nA third party makes a crypto VC investment in exchange for funding the development of a new technology. There are several types of investments that can be made with cryptocurrencies – some are made as a investment and some are made as a reward for investing. What makes a crypto-VC investment different from other forms of funding is that it’s made by a third party. This is also the reason that you should carefully evaluate every investment opportunity with a view to eliminating any potential conflicts of interest.\n\n**Can’t beat luck in investing? Here’s how**\nA few things can prevent you from being a victim of the largest crypto-VC investment scam on record. Read on to learn about some of the most significant changes that will affect the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry in general as a result of the massive investment in virtual assets by a third party organization known as “Crypto VC”. Be sure to keep these major issues in mind when evaluating investments:\n\n* Is this investment for the right person?\n* Is this investment worthwhile for the right reasons?\n* Is the investment appropriate for my personal finances?\n\n**Summary**\nA variety of changes will affect the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries in general due to the purchase of cryptocurrency by a third party. The most significant change will be the creation of a dedicated regulatory authority – known as a “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” (DAO”) – to manage and regulate the new industry. Additionally, the introduction of a new “blockchain-based” technology called the “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” (Dao) will allow the industry to shift away from a centralized system and into a newer and more agile model. To make sure that you’re on the right track with your investment decision, stay current by following these steps: -evaluate the pros and cons of every investment opportunity with a view to eliminating any potential conflicts of interest.\n\nKeep in mind that each investment opportunity is different and that this is only the tip of the iceberg. You can protect yourself from potential conflicts of interest by following these steps:\n\n* Establish clear and consistent investment goals.\n* Only invest in companies that have a clear investment objective.\n* Don’t invest in companies that have any connection to illegal or unethical activities.\n* Don’t invest with funds that you’re not completely sure about.\n\n*Buy me a coffee [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/xuanling1111) if you want to support my writing.[Towfiqu barbhuiya](https://unsplash.com/@towfiqu999999?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/bankruptcy?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)*", "timestamp": 1658172139, "digest": "HsMzIi6a8dhbcmFYt_GoXsXzIHF8o-WeviVgsYiv8Vs", "contributor": "0x87D5032831E5C092c87eb879e5108da7D58f9192"}

On July 30th, 2021, four unique Coca-Cola NFTs were up for auction as a single ‘loot box’, for sale on Opensea.io. All proceeds for the sale went to Special Olympics International, a longtime partner of Coca-Cola. Auctioned as one lot, the collection features multi-sensory NFTs housed inside a ‘Friendship Box’. Coca-Cola’s Josh Schwarber explains, “The metaverse—which is borderless and ‘geo-less’—creates opportunities to connect with others like never before. We didn’t want to do this just to make an NFT. We wanted to inject the core principles of Coca-Cola and celebrate both our heritage and ties to friendship, while also doing something that hasn’t been done before.”\n\nThe Friendship Box acts as a dynamic loot box that contains the following:\n\n* Physical: The winning bidder received a real-life SMEG FAB28 Coca-Cola fridge, stocked with ice-cold Coke.\n* Digital: A custom-designed Coca-Cola Bubble jacket wearable, which included an unlockable version that can be worn in Decentraland. A Sound Visualizer NFT included the ‘unmistakable fizz of a Coke’ complete with visual effects. Lastly, ‘The Friendship Card’ refreshes 1948 artwork used in a set of Coca-Cola trading cards from the 1990s symbolizing friendship and refreshment. The metaverse-influenced iteration of the cards add motion, light and 3D features.\n\n**Coca-Cola Snow Globes:** Coca-Cola partnered with VeVe (a popular digital collectable app) to release a collection of Christmas themed digital collectables. This drop included the classic Polar Bear, Coke Bottles, Neon Coca-Cola sign, and a singular Coke bottle. Each drop had a different list price, rarity level, and number of collectables available to purchase. VeVe is being used to simplify the process of purchasing and using NFTs.\n\n**Coca-Cola Zero Sugar Byte:** Coca-Cola recently announced it is launching a gaming-inspired version of a virtual Coke beverage, surrounding the Coca-Cola Starlight release. The first video game it will be available in will be Fortnite. Coke has teamed up with gaming organization PWR to help with the creation of Pixel Point, a custom island built in Fortnite Creative. Fortnite Creative is a separate mode within Fortnite that allows companies and players to build their own custom worlds. Once players enter Pixel Point, they can try out coke-themed mini-games, as well as ‘try’ the new drink flavors.\n\n**The Coca-Cola Combo Burger Day Collection:** This International Burger Day (May 28th), Coca-Cola dropped more than 4000 free, unique digital collectables celebrating the classic combination of an ice-cold Coca-Cola and a burger hot off the grill. Every Coca-Cola combo comes in a mysterious red bag and inside each bag you’ll find a generative burger with varying traits to satisfy every taste, and a classic bottle of Coca-Cola Zero that goes with every single one. This release was as floppy as a barely cooked burger, with virtually zero traction or interest from anyone. \\*\n\n**Coca-Cola Pride Collection**: The Coca-Cola Pride collection is a series of 136 digital collectibles made in celebration of the LGBTQIA+ community. The limited edition pieces feature an exclusive take on the iconic Coca-Cola bottle with artwork by Rich Mnisi, fashion designer and leading campaigner for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Africa. His commissioned design has been sliced into individual fragments and dispersed across all 136 collectibles, making each one unique. The collection aims to shine color-filled light on the LGBTQIA+ community's members and spread a message of Love. This collection was released on Polygon and currently has a low floor price and total volume.\n\n![Four different ways how not to release a branded NFT collection](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RSJZ07igKc1XkpGXT1qre.webp?height=767&width=767)\n\n## POS System\n\nCoca-Cola partnered with connectivity platform Omnivore to create a digital marketplace that makes it easier for customers to order Coke products through a Menu Management System (MMS) . MMS helps restaurant brands manage the complexity of numerous digital menus across online ordering, third-party apps, menu boards, kiosks, and more. MMS integrates the POS system, resulting in order injection, data collection, and control of content. This can allow for immediate pricing updates, deeper analytics, and easier surcharging.\n\nUSD is the only accepted currency on Coca-Cola’s website for US customers. Coca-Cola’s website allows for SSO via Google, Facebook, and Apple.

These metrics are included below. The metrics for more recent collections were so unimpressive and low (sub 1ETH total volume) that making a dashboard for the collections seemed like a waste of time.\n\n## Secondary Market Analytics\n\n(Secondary sales for Coca-Cola are the same as the original price of the only NFT sold traditionally on [Opensea.io](http://Opensea.io).

Every single release has been a flop\n* Needs a bigger tech team focused on NFTs and metaverse content to stay competitive and roll out new offerings quicker; Coke needs to stop releasing boring NFT collections\n* There are little to no notable utilities associated with the NFTs offered, and the only notable NFT offered was sold at a price that is entirely unaffordable and unrealistic for the average consumer\n* Little to no incorporation of the metaverse events or NFTs on the main website; no mention of web3 offerings on the Coca-Cola app\n* IP is interested in web3 but at this point has invested very little and is cautious to invest more time and energy into the space\n\nOpportunities\n\n* Is easily one of the largest and most successful companies in the world, with a brand so recognizable it is hard to think of anything more cemented in American culture\n* The first NFT launch was met with a ton of interest and bidding from ardent fans; Coca-Cola can recover from a poor launch in ways other brands cannot\n* Digital brands are eager to partner with Coca-Cola, and the brand is being selective on how they proceed in the market\n\nThreats\n\n* The lack of a Coca-Cola Discord server means that any comparable competitor could beat them in the social media space just by appealing to younger audiences\n* Other major soda brands could just as easily and quickly embrace web3. Nothing Coke has done is not replicable by other brands\n* The success or failure of VeVe as the established and primary online platform for digital collectables could sway Coke from pursuing NFTs more seriously.

This has caused increased skepticism of the long-term viability of the VeVe platform\n* Waiting for the right moment to embrace the metaverse more strongly just means another brand may take their place and gain popularity online-Repeated flops could turn long-term web3 investors away permanently\n\n## Summary\n\nCoca-Cola is a legendary brand that is beginning to embrace web3 and finding unique ways to incorporate it into its brand IP. Although Coke has been slow to roll-out new NFT and metaverse offerings, previous releases have been well received by the public and have not induced backlash. Coca-Cola Combo Burger Day and LGBTQIA+ releases were to practically zero fanfare, with some of the lowest floor prices seen for a major brand (consequently also on Polygon). The Coca-Cola app shows no signs of incorporating cryptocurrency or NFTs anytime soon, which could mean that full adoption for the brand is some time away. It is difficult to derive the metrics from Coke’s VeVe release, given the closed nature of the platform. With a solid IP and impressive annual gross profit, Coke can take the time it needs to decide how best to proceed in the web3 market.\n\nSocial Media\n<https://www.instagram.com/cocacola/>\n<https://www.tiktok.com/@cocacola>\n<https://twitter.com/CocaCola>\n\nReferences\n<https://www.thedrum.com/news/2019/06/26/coca-cola-creates-digital-marketplace-make-ordering-easier>\n<https://nftnew.net/2022/04/08/the-coca-cola-x-veve-partner-will-turn-the-starlight-flavor-into-nft/>\n<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/omnivore-partners-with-coca-cola-to-launch-digital-menu-management-solution-300852719.html>\n<https://medium.com/veve-collectibles/coca-cola-snow-globes-ddc7444b6789>\n<https://maketafi.com/coca-cola-nft>\n<https://etherscan.io/address/0x455f04c9c54fffa699e9f6b1271e857a1f2bddfa>\n<https://www.ledgerinsights.com/coca-cola-nfts-pride/>\n<https://opensea.io/collection/the-coca-cola-combo-burger-day-collection>\n\nNeed help with your web3 go-to-market strategy?

Sustainability, sports partnerships, and mental health awareness are three consistent themes through Coke’s brand style and storytelling.\n\n## Initiatives\n\n***Coca-Cola app (web2)*:** Coca-Cola app is a customer loyalty program to ‘unlock refreshing surprises and redeem rewards—all at your fingertips’. Customers primarily interact with Coke’s loyalty program through the *Coca-Cola* app for iOS/Android. Coca-Cola app offerings include scanning icons on Coca-Cola packaging to earn ‘rewards and access personalized experiences’. Customers can create their own custom beverage mixes via Coca-Cola Freestyle®, and can receive location-based rewards and offers at theaters and restaurants.\n\n**Coca-Cola Insiders Club:** Insider’s Club was a box subscription service that Coca-Cola tested as a service from January 2021 to March 2021.

The void showed me I was still on the first few steps of my thousand mile journey.\n\nI clutched my sword as the void lit up around me. It became strings of numbers and letters flying past. I tentatively reached my sword out to tap it. Suddenly, those numbers and letters flowed up the sword and through my being.\n\nIn an instant, the history of technology since 1917 passed through my mind: machines to computers to virtual life. I now understood I was a digital being.\n\nThen the void's numbers and letters morphed into animated images like me: all kinds, all colors. I plunged my sword into the stream and the images began flowing through me. In an instant, I lived the history of animation.\n\n![Illustration by TsukiMidnight](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/igsILrzhYefv4PHwxrbC-.jpg?height=3000&width=1500)\n\nThe magic of anime flowed into my heart and mind.

Later, I moved on to his disco-oriented solo work. I've always been struck by how he could bring melodic warmth to electronic sounds. This hypnotic piece is a perfect example. It's trance-inducing yet gets the pulse racing - and that makes it a perfect soundtrack for Hekonai diving head-first into the mysteries of his new world.*\n\n**The Hekonai's Journal is an ongoing meta-narrative.

This initiative would make Cannabis Genome DAO the first digital cooperative to maintain an ownership stake in a physical laboratory. As such, Cannabis Genome DAO would be granted full rights of a member of the company with access to financial reporting and an ability to ensure that the fidelity and transparency of laboratory practices are maintained. The alignment of incentives and governance rights between a community that benefits from using the laboratory, with the governance and incentives of the laboratory operations itself, directly benefits the community and users of the laboratories services.\n\n## Overview of Proposed Crowdfund\n\nFunding would go toward purchasing a membership interest in Delta Leaf, which is currently undergoing equity fundraising in pursuit of a traditional VC investment or strategic partnership from another organization. This provides the opportunity for Cannabis Genome DAO to fill that need. Funding from the sale of membership interest in Delta Leaf would be used for improving and expanding their services. These services include an upgrade to the Delta Leaf web app that would enable users to manage their laboratory results using self-custodial web3 wallets with the option to publish directly to the data marketplace being developed by Cannabis Genome DAO. Governance of Delta Leaf would be aligned with the mission and values of Cannabis Genome DAO because members of the latter would exert a significant amount of direct control over the operations of the former.\n\nThe crowdfund would be hosted here on Mirror and structured as a sale of a collection of tiered NFT editions. More information below.\n\n* [Cannabis Genome DAO](https://cannabisgeno.me) (“CGD”) would purchase a 20% membership interest in [Delta Leaf Laboratories LLC](https://deltaleaflabs.com) (“Delta Leaf”), a California Limited Liability Corporation.\n* Cannabis Genome DAO (“CGD\") is a \"[nonprofit association](https://ipfs//bafybeifzhrfh47zq743j35hq7v6lwmoqizzj665hwp7zzoqig6abveog6i/?filename=Delaware_UNA_Agreement_-_CGD.pdf)\" under the Delaware Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, §§ 1901-1916. CGD is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a partnership.\n* Governance of the CGD’s membership interest in Delta Leaf would be managed through the distribution of DLL tokens to members of CGD who contribute to this fundraiser.\n* The total DLL token supply would exclusively distribute governance rights to CGD members and does not distribute ownership right in Delta Leaf to individual members of CGD.\n* DLL tokens would not, and will not, represent any financial claim by individual CGD members to potential profit or obligation to potential losses incurred by CGD while CGD is acting as a member of Delta Leaf.\n* CGD and the CGD treasury would incur all financial profit and loss related to membership of CGD in Delta Leaf. The proceeds of this crowdfund will be sent to the CGD community multi-sig for the explicit purpose of completing the purchase of a membership interest in Delta Leaf as described herein.\n\n![Felipe's cousin Isaac made this graphic years ago.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D9MgsIfEXNqBfUuhtGwnJ.png?height=1440&width=2560)\n\n## DLL Token Allocations\n\nGovernance of Delta Leaf comprises a subset of the proposed activities encompassed by the [CGD Community Hyperthesis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/182fZ2WIQCL15O0TbQmkaJFM8tci06czuuqTMzBl_-zs/edit?usp=sharing). Therefore, the token allocation will primarily be distributed directly to participants in the crowdfunding campaign with only 20% being reserved for community management by CGD itself. This will decentralize governance directly to financial supporters while aligning them with the remaining CGD community who does not participate in the crowdfunding campaign or joins the community later after the campaign ends. Further, an additional 10% will be reserved for incentivizing the ongoing development of infrastructure for the regenerative crypto-economic system proposed in the CGD Community Hyperthesis. This third portion will align the potential success of this crowdfund with the CGD ecosystem in the short term.\n\n* 70% of the DLL token supply will be allocated directly to CGD members who contribute to the fundraiser.\n* 20% of the DLL token supply will be reserved in the CGD treasury and managed by a community multi-sig wallet.\n  * Multi-sig address: 0xb39EB13E9B69809ed938842D5Ea1A89a97787315\n* 10% of the DLL token supply will be sent to a separate multi-sig wallet to be used exclusively for incentivizing the development of CSAT token smart contracts, a custom front-end for CannaData.Market and other initiatives for CGD.\n  * Multi-sig address: 0x99A05055820f8c4794879B2617b520513C7DFca1\n\n## Who Are The Members of Delta Leaf?\n\n![Action shots of Delta Leaf from the 2017 UCSB New Venture Fair & Competition.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Py4GiPSOEjCeoBW-Z2-B.png?height=673&width=2251)\n\n### 1.

Not because I was heroic or anything: it was just one outsider responding to another.\n\nThat couldn't be the only reason. I looked deeper and saw that he was frustrated at work. He spent his days drawing animation cells for other people's designs.

It was their stab at a concept album. It was a commercial failure and remains hotly debated by fans but has built its own cult following because it's so unique. This song explores the importance of having someone to look up to, making it perfect for that moment when Hekonai discovers the human he idealizes is struggling to hang on. It's got the gentlest vocal Gene Simmons ever recorded and his poignant tone, combined with elegant orchestration, just might give you serious feels when you hear it.*\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**The Hekonai's Journal** is an ongoing meta-narrative.

The portals quickly began growing in size as their revolutions sped up.\n\nDid I just sign my own death warrant?\n\n*Please enjoy the next post #5 below in the Hekonai Journal:*\n\n[https://tinyurl.com/3d9wcxp6](https://tinyurl.com/3d9wcxp6)\n\n**Post Soundtrack:**\n\n[In The Space Capsule (The Love Theme) - Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iQpThqdMbo?&autoplay=true&display=iframe)\n\nIn the author’s mind: *Like a lot of '80s babies, I grew up loving the film Flash Gordon and this grandfathered me into loving the music of Queen. This cue scored the journey of the rocket containing the heroes into the kingdom of Ming The Merciless and it's got a mix of electronic dreaminess and martial percussion plus a fantastic orchestral tag.

This morning my wife mentioned she was reading a book on comfort. What’s are good ways to make sense of these sorts of claims? It definitely felt true. We also can’t exactly ask whether humans living 120,000 years ago didn’t also create problems or whether they thought they were comfortable. Is that type of skepticism actually useful though? \n3. What are good personal digital hygiene habits? Things like being intentional about checking the news, email, social media and the many other information inputs that can easily overwhelm us. \n   1. This sort of thing can lapse into the self-help ish space though there definitely seems to be a big gap and appetite for useful rules and practices to deal with what can feel like chaos.\n   2. There are good books written by thoughtful folks like Cal Newport that talk about these dynamics at an individual level. What are the right type of institutions that can help people that struggle to deal with the information avalanche? \n   3. There are also well intentioned yet polemical books like Jaron Lanier’s book *Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now*.

{"id": "zsgdaylZUfCDgnrLvz51btTczmtIy4lpEPUEp0fNgig", "title": "Artist Spotlight: Abieyuwa", "body": "### Meet Abieyuwa.\n\nAbieyuwa is a multidisciplinary artist and curator. She has created various works about colorism, cultural pride, and mental health, specifically focusing on how they relate to the lives of black women. She is passionate about creating art through a variety of tools and media including photography, digital and analog video, 3D modeling, and acrylic paint. Abieyuwa identifies as Nigerian-American and you can see that in her work which portray narratives that represent her lived experience, and her Esan and Igbo culture. She couples her experience with her aptitude for technology to explore themes that reflect being a black woman in contemporary society. In 2020 amidst the pandemic she began a series that featured African women from different countries and cultures to shatter the stereotypes of similarity between women from different African nations, highlighting their individuality first and foremost. Abieyuwa is hoping to continue this series in the future, expanding to represent more countries and tribal groups that are unseen in the media. Among many other prestigious publications her portraits have been exhibited at the Houston Center for Photography in the *Contemporary Practice* and *Togethering*  exhibitions. Her goals center around inspiring black women of all ages, especially the young black girl(s) she once was, hoping they feel represented, valued, and highlighted in her work. She wants to see her work uplift and encourage these women:\n\n> I hope that they will feel that they are being accurately represented and will feel pride. I hope that my work will uplift and encourage them to embrace our natural beauty and ignore messages that constantly attack our self-worth and self-esteem.      - Abieyuwa\n\n### Communities\n\nAbieyuwa is involved in multiple communities of artists that align with her mission and views: \n\n> I’ve definitely learned a lot from my peers, especially my friend King Uranta. His 3D work inspires me so I’m constantly asking him questions and for feedback on my work because I value his opinion a lot. I actually learn from all my fellow 3D artists such as MadebyM1ke, Hyper9, Prince Ude, Rayan El-Nayal, etc. We have a Twitter community where we share WIPs and ask for each other’s advice on software and techniques.          - Abieyuwa\n\nOne of these communities, [African NFT Community](https://twitter.com/africannftclub), is an empowered community of African creators digitally sharing their cultural influence through NFTs. Their goal is to provide the platform and resources to help African creators navigate the web3 world so they can leverage the true power of the digital revolution and make a name for themselves in the digital art world. They are working to achieve this by providing educational opportunities, advice, and support via community round tables and live rooms on Clubhouse and Twitter spaces. Their organization operates as a DAO to allow for input in decision making processes and resource allocation, as well as equity for the African artists. Within the community Abieyuwa is on the core team and works with a variety of tools to express herself in her art. In short, the African NFT Club is an incubator that advocates for African artists by giving them the tools to break down barriers and spread their influence across the world. Abieyuwa is also closely involved in Cybet Baat which is a playground for creators of African descent in the metaverse; Herstory, an art collective dedicated to preserving and incubating the stories of marginalized crypto creators; and A2 Accelerate Art, a decentralized community of creatives, collectors and builders focused on supporting emerging artists. \n\n### Art\n\nAbieyuwa has been in love with art and drawing since she was a child growing up in Nigeria. As a child she was always watching cartoons and creating some of her own. In high school, she took art electives every year and had plans on majoring in Visual Arts. When she got to college she decided to major in something more “serious,” thinking she couldnt make a career out of her art. Fast forward to post graduation and her first full time job, she realized her true calling was in art. Abieyuwa’s style of art is versatile. She is interested in drawing and painting as well as digital art, photography and video. Her inspiration comes from black women, which you can see as the usual subject in her art. She also utilizes symbols and designs of her ancestors in her art to represent where she comes from: \n\n>  I did research on pre-colonial traditions of the Esan & Igbo tribes of Nigeria. These tribes are where my family is from and I used elements from them in my art. For my series of work celebrating nail art, I incorporated Igbo uli symbols from my research to bring more awareness to the artform that was looked down on by English colonizers. I’ve also created work inspired by the traditional bridal attire of Edo/Esan brides.             - Abieyuwa\n\nShe believes representation is important in all areas of life. Her art embodies the divine feminine that exists in every woman regardless of race. The subject of her art, black women, are showcased in angelic poses wearing lavish attire which brings out the divinity in them. She utilizes bright colors to provide contrast and make the focal point of her art stand out. Abieyuwa is a very talented and passionate artist, time and time again her work is nothing short of a masterpiece. \n\n### Gallery\n\n![“Déesse de l'eau\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zkcRYIiSduVgtSnJMHOXE.jpeg?height=1200&width=960)\n\n![\"A Heavy Burden\" ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3S_2AHq-YD8XaNF5uGyUa.jpeg?height=933&width=1200)\n\n![\"Obhiaha's Magazine\" ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yOt68_3ktT1fu2xDLIJsL.jpeg?height=680&width=543)\n\n“Obhiaha’s Magazine” was originally crafted for NFT NYC’s diversity showcase.

Abieyuwa is also closely involved in Cybet Baat which is a playground for creators of African descent in the metaverse; Herstory, an art collective dedicated to preserving and incubating the stories of marginalized crypto creators; and A2 Accelerate Art, a decentralized community of creatives, collectors and builders focused on supporting emerging artists. \n\n### Art\n\nAbieyuwa has been in love with art and drawing since she was a child growing up in Nigeria. As a child she was always watching cartoons and creating some of her own. In high school, she took art electives every year and had plans on majoring in Visual Arts. When she got to college she decided to major in something more “serious,” thinking she couldnt make a career out of her art. Fast forward to post graduation and her first full time job, she realized her true calling was in art. Abieyuwa’s style of art is versatile. She is interested in drawing and painting as well as digital art, photography and video. Her inspiration comes from black women, which you can see as the usual subject in her art. She also utilizes symbols and designs of her ancestors in her art to represent where she comes from: \n\n> “I did research on pre-colonial traditions of the Esan & Igbo tribes of Nigeria. These tribes are where my family is from and I used elements from them in my art. For my series of work celebrating nail art, I incorporated Igbo uli symbols from my research to bring more awareness to the artform that was looked down on by English colonizers. I’ve also created work inspired by the traditional bridal attire of Edo/Esan brides.”           - Abieyuwa\n\nShe believes representation is important in all areas of life. Her art embodies the divine feminine that exists in every woman regardless of race. The subject of her art, black women, are showcased in angelic poses wearing lavish attire which brings out the divinity in them. She utilizes bright colors to provide contrast and make the focal point of her art stand out. Abieyuwa is a very talented and passionate artist, time and time again her work is nothing short of a masterpiece. \n\n### Gallery\n\n![“Déesse de l'eau\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zkcRYIiSduVgtSnJMHOXE.jpeg?height=1200&width=960)\n\n![\"A Heavy Burden\" ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3S_2AHq-YD8XaNF5uGyUa.jpeg?height=933&width=1200)\n\n![\"Obhiaha's Magazine\" ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yOt68_3ktT1fu2xDLIJsL.jpeg?height=680&width=543)\n\n“Obhiaha’s Magazine” was originally crafted for NFT NYC’s diversity showcase.

{"id": "LBJkaKf6RiZ3hgBY47EGOGoBhUPed-hHvqGcujzyhO0", "title": "Review: Bringing better governance to real-world communities with quadratic funding", "body": "**TL;DR: city3 and Gitcoin’s first local quadratic funding experiment saw 7 Oakland nonprofits raise \\~$4,000 from 240+ unique contributors. In this recap we share the opportunities and challenges in bringing innovative governance models to offline communities.**\n\nCity3’s mission is to create more just socio-economic systems powered by crypto for existing real world communities. As part of this effort, we recently partnered with [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) to bring quadratic funding to the city of Oakland.\n\n[Quadratic funding](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000) (QF) is a mathematically and democratically optimal way to fund public goods, where matching capital is distributed based on a quadratic formula that makes the number of contributors matter more than the amount raised.\n\n![Quadratic funding explained (EOS)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8CJudW5yeHroHo9FiCaH2.png?height=415&width=768)\n\nWe originally set out with three broad questions outlined in our [announcement](https://mirror.xyz/0xcity3.eth/8ZgDDZcixWbLW9Jb79Vuc5illbB5IiKU-c-NyCfabEQ):\n\n* Is supporting an organization that you care about an effective incentive for someone to set up a web3 wallet?\n* What can quadratic funding tell us about the way people value civic organizations?\n* Will small dollar contributors feel they’ve made a significant contribution?\n\nIn this article we highlight two major takeaways from the experience:\n\n1. **To optimize positive results, we should identify the types of decisions and/or public goods that thrive when QF is applied.** We recommend a stronger alignment with the two problems QF is designed to address: information asymmetry and the free rider problem.\n2. **Governance experiments need to prioritize building trust, accessibility and diverse representation.** Funding real-world public goods comes with its own set of challenges, but existing tools are not designed for offline communities. This is an open call for more QF projects “in the wild”.\n\n# Overview and results\n\nDuring [Gitcoin Grants Round 14](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gr14-results/) which ran from 8-23 June 2022, 7 Oakland nonprofits raised $3,799.07 from 454 contributions and 249 unique contributors. $15,000 has been set aside for matching, funded jointly by city3 and the [Oakland Fund for Public Innovation](https://www.oaklandfund.org/).\n\n![Gitcoin’s quadratic funding local cause round for Oakland](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eh6o2W2RW1rMLSWhG70zd.png?height=1488&width=1830)\n\nAlthough contributing to the round was open to anyone, we hosted a series of virtual governance workshops aimed at assisting locals with setting up a non-custodial crypto wallet and Github account, and then navigating Gitcoin’s checkout process.\n\nDuring these workshops we saw firsthand how most web3 tools are simply not designed for offline communities, let alone mobile-first users.\n\nYet despite the friction, several residents expressed surprise that crypto could be used in this way. For those interacting with crypto for the first time, there was something viscerally meaningful about seeing a $5 donation get matched with $30 for an organization in their community. Those already familiar with crypto expressed a desire to see more of these initiatives:\n\n> *“I am currently working full time for a DAO, and it's cool how global it is, but would love to get more involved \\[with\\] local web3/crypto efforts.”*\n\nExact numbers on local participation are not available, but by combining Gitcoin’s profile location data with the number of people who attended our governance workshops and/or responded to our feedback surveys, we estimate that 20% of contributors were Oakland residents.\n\nClearly, there exists some critical threshold at which representation either justifies or undermines the entire quadratic funding process. This also highlights why education and accessibility are so important, and ought to be considered integral to any effective quadratic funding program.\n\nConsider a hypothetical grants round with higher-stakes decisions. While outside funding might still be useful to maximize funds raised, would we still weigh votes equally between locals and non-locals? We’re excited about the early although untested solutions that attempt to solve this, such as intersectional social data (see [RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/2019-10-24-uh78r5/)) or geo-spatial weighting (see [Astral Protocol](https://docs.astral.global/) or [Foam](https://foam.space/)).\n\n# Where does quadratic funding matter most?\n\nIn their 2020 paper, *[Building Radical Cities](https://assets.website-files.com/5d253237e31f051057dc0a2b/5f04beb70336ec0cc37ceff9_Building%20Radical%20Charter%20Cities.pdf)*, Paul Healy and Matt Prewitt identify QF as one of several mechanisms to better calibrate political expression at the city level. QF has been a popular choice for distributing public grants in the cryptosphere. For example, Gitcoin Grants Round 14 saw record breaking numbers: over 44,000 contributors donated $1.7M which will be boosted by a $3.2M matching pool.\n\nJust as QF supports “long tail” crypto projects – novel, small initiatives that otherwise would not be able to accumulate startup capital – we set out to test whether the same could be applied to long tail “real-world” projects, particularly civic organizations that play a critical role in serving their communities. While several offline projects have raised funds with Gitcoin in the past, this was the first time matching was targeted at a specific geographic community.\n\nWe are incredibly proud to have worked with Oakland nonprofits doing important work ranging from tech mentorship to supporting gang-impacted youth. And while we believe that nothing bad happens when impactful community organizations get money they deserve, in hindsight we do question whether funding local nonprofits was the most useful application of this governance tool.\n\nThe benefit of QF lies not so much in matching large sums of capital to small donations as in surfacing the nuance of community preferences in order to produce the best possible allocation outcome for decisions involving competing public goods.\n\nHere we turn to the two problems QF is most cited to solve:\n\n1. **QF solves an information problem.** In a world of scarce resources, the government (or more broadly, the public) does not always know how much of a certain good to provide\n2. **QF solves a free rider problem.** Those who benefit from public goods often underpay or don’t pay at all because there is little incentive to make small, individual contributions.\n\nWe believe we could have done a better job of scoping the problem space and designing our QF program to directly address these areas. For our next experiment, we may consider these questions as part of our decision making framework:\n\n1. What are some examples of competing public goods that we find difficult to prioritize in the local city budget?\n2. What are some areas of public resource allocation that people frequently complain feels unrepresentative and/or unfair?\n3. What are some alternative governance models already being applied in the community (e.g. participatory budgeting, neighborhood council advisory boards) – are they willing to try a new approach?\n\n# A call for more quadratic funding “in the wild”\n\nSome of our biggest coordination challenges exist at the city level. While there is growing interest in new governance models enabled by web3 technology, we haven’t seen these implemented outside of [a few examples](https://twitter.com/0xcity3/status/1534576283232763905). In other words, whether quadratic funding is indeed democratically and economically optimal is yet to be tested at scale.\n\nWe see a massive opportunity to combine the best of tokenized governance with decisions that tangibly affect the communities we live in. Several organizations are already doing work that makes this possible:\n\n* [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)\n* [Endaoment](https://endaoment.org/)\n* [Change](https://getchange.io/)\n* [RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/)\n* [Clr.fund](https://clr.fund/#/)\n* [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/)\n\nWe hope to see more crypto tools designed to serve real-world communities. For this to happen, we simultaneously need to invest in [pre-existing social infrastructure](https://otherinter.net/research/local-gov/) that has a long legacy of making our cities more just, more livable and more resilient.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe believe that QF is only as impactful as it is accessible and only as useful as it solves critical problems that could not be solved through simpler means.\n\nThe Oakland local cause round was the first of many programs city3 will be launching to bridge web3 innovation with real-world community needs. Just as crypto crowdfunding has expanded possibilities for seeding public goods, we have a unique opportunity to shift resource allocation within our cities.\n\n[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xcity3) to stay up to date with our work.", "timestamp": 1658174812, "digest": "SjQdVyClJxNBbANfxAQCHwwjKmqkeyOgb0WoZL5ilpk", "contributor": "0x27F2a7D8ce449C9A1E35Fc859Aa0d1053f5E47D3"}
{"id": "v9F5EIgL_HMvL4jePB-N-uPPPxZH96DSyS3cWe2JURs", "title": "Crypto's Native Frontier", "body": "For billions of people around the globe, Web3 represents an opportunity to realize a vibrant new digital world – one that isn’t designed and controlled by a handful of executives in the glass towers of primarily Western megacities.\n\nIt isn’t just about economic empowerment, either. \n\n**Web3 offers transformative potential that stretches deep into the realms of cultural identity, entertainment, and communication… and ultimately into the place where these concepts have converged for thousands of years: gaming.**\n\nThe Crypto Revolution is going to reshape our world not because engineers in Silicon Valley are creating a new generation of user technology, but because Web3’s diverse participants are creating open infrastructure that people everywhere will use to build new worlds themselves.\n\nToday, gaming is a $200B market composed of 3 billion gamers and the fastest evolving form of media in the world.\n\nIn order to understand why gaming will be a core frontier in the context of the social-technological revolution playing out today, we first need to explore gaming’s history and trajectory.\n\n> ## The Very Beginning:\n\nGaming is as native to human culture as language is (and may even predate it). \n\n**Serving as an invaluable social mechanism throughout history, we’ve used games to bond, teach, develop our values, and make sense of the world.**\n\nThe cradle of civilization that was the Middle East naturally saw the emergence of the first examples. In the 3000s BC, Mesopotamians played The Royal Game of Ur on beautifully painted boards, while the Egyptians played Senet.\n\nChaturanga would formally appear in India around 600 AD, though examples of its predecessors date back to 3000 BC. The Persians adopted it as Shatranj before European traders brought it over and turned it into Chess.\n\nAs far back as 2000 BC, Mesoamericans were playing a ballgame on courts. The activity was of immense societal importance, incorporated in rituals and used to resolve conflicts or even war.\n\nThis era also saw Ancient China develop Wei Qi – known today as Go – originally used to practice and refine strategic thinking. Later Chinese dynasties would also invent playing cards and dominoes.\n\n* ***Games have always held enormous societal significance across a variety of contexts – military, social, educational, and entertainment \n ***\n* ***We now think of it as an industry, but throughout the majority of our history gaming was an intrinsic activity that underpinned most of culture \n ***\n* ***We congratulate ourselves for our use of games to teach, train, and connect, when in reality humans have very effectively used games to do all of this for thousands of years \n ***\n* ***Today’s progressive gamification of society – investing, learning, working, collaborating – is really just a revival of an ancient behavior codified in our brains***\n\n> ## Back to the Future:\n\nGerman-American engineer Ralph Baer, inspired by the mass production and ownership of televisions as a key primitive, first envisioned a game that could be played on a home television in 1966. The following year, he and his colleagues at Sanders Associates invented a prototype system known as “The Black Box” – the first multiplayer console video game system, initially licensed under the name of “Magnavox Odyssey.”\n\n* ***This is an important point in the nature of technology: the creation of a new primitive (in this case, televisions) combines with an existing human behavior (gaming) to unlock a universe of new possibilities***\n\nThe Odyssey would soon inspire its competitor Atari to launch its own video game in 1972/3, initially an arcade video game called Pong that would later be turned into a version playable at home.\n\n* ***Both the history and future of gaming are underpinned by social connections: yesterday’s arcades will be tomorrow’s metaverse***\n\n> ## Leveling Up with Composability:\n\nAtari broke new ground in 1977 by launching the Atari 2600 VCS that allowed users to switch out game cartridges via an external ROM slot. Though Atari built dozens of games themselves, their creation of generalizable gaming hardware allowed third-party programmers across the globe to design their own games for the console.\n\nOther novel features included levels with increasing difficulty, scoring systems, and leaderboards, setting the stage for the communities that would soon form around games themselves.\n\n> ## New Entrants:\n\nAn intense wave of consumer demand, fueled by the launch of massively popular games like Space Invaders, was followed by a crash in the industry as excessive hype led to an oversupply of cheap games.\n\nThe crash wouldn’t last long, however, as a new (yet very old) powerhouse would rise from the East. Nintendo, founded in 1889 as a manufacturer of playing cards, launched a number of titles in the early 1980s that would shape the industry forever, including Donkey Kong, Mario Bros., Zelda, and other major titles.\n\nNintendo also launched its own console: the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), featuring significant technological improvements relative to its existing peers.\n\nIn 1989, Nintendo made history once more by releasing the first handheld Game Boy – forever transforming the world of gaming and **setting the stage for the mobile revolution that would come many years later**.\n\nAs we’ll explore later, gaming’s biggest domain has shifted to mobile, paying homage to one of its earliest and most important innovations.\n\n* ***Consoles were never the endgame – they were the intermediate medium while the hardware and software caught up during a long period of intense development***\n\n> ## Upgrading the Stack:\n\nThe console wars of the 1990s saw companies like Sega, Nintendo, and Sony battle for dominance as they leveraged a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem to develop increasingly sophisticated consoles and game franchises.\n\n**In parallel,** **the technological explosion that engulfed the world in the ‘80s and ‘90s saw computers enter millions of homes**. \n\nThe tremendous increase in computing power allowed developers to supercharge their efforts, leading to the dawn of three-dimensional gaming experiences and online play.\n\nAs more homes came online, LAN parties became extremely popular, with players meeting up in person to compete by connecting to the local network.\n\nThe 2000’s saw a new era of console wars, this time between Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation), and Nintendo (Wii), **with** **competition centering on graphics, quality of storyline, and, eventually, the online gaming experience**. Marketplaces sprung up, allowing users to purchase titles or downloadable content, upgrade software, and communicate with other players.\n\nAdvanced open world games with simulated autonomous characters also became extremely popular as a predecessor to the digital metaverse boom we’re seeing today.\n\nPC-based MMORPGs became a global phenomenon in their own right, competing less on graphics or story and more on community, digital identity, and portability.\n\n* ***The explosion in PC gaming offered a glimpse of what billions of users would ultimately prioritize in their gaming experiences***\n\n> ## Going Mobile:\n\nDecreasing computing and hardware costs allowed the global gaming audience to grow exponentially over the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n**Just as the prevalence of personal computers provided a new medium for the industry to expand into, so too did the billions of mobile phones produced in the late 2000s and early 2010s offer a new route for adoption.**\n\nMobile gaming continued where PC-based gaming left off, prioritizing experiences that offered portability, simplicity, and community interaction. \n\n**The rise of mobile phones as the primary computing hardware used by billions of people saw the gaming demographic expand into casual players of all ages**, with low-cost games spinning up to meet every user profile.\n\nThe market for mobile games was worth \\~$120B in 2021 and is expected to triple over the next decade as the computing stack gets even better.\n\n* ***As with TVs before, the mobile transformation offers further proof of a recurring historical pattern: technological infrastructure introduced for one purpose tends to unlock astonishing value across myriad others \n ***\n* ***Blockchains will likely end up underpinning trillions in value across cultural and social use cases we have yet to imagine, extending well beyond the initial applications in decentralized finance***\n\n> ## Beyond Gaming:\n\nJust as the demographic has expanded tremendously over gaming’s first few decades, so too has its very meaning.\n\n**Two critical developments took place in the late 2010s:**\n\n**1) The ability to integrate real world culture into the game itself**\n\n**2) The creation of in-game economies for digital assets**\n\nFranchises like Fortnite were early pioneers in recognizing that online gaming was as much about the competition as it was about expressing social identity and connecting over cultural movements in an open, digital environment.\n\n* ***The industry’s life cycle has seen a steady convergence of social interactions and traditional gaming, with the former seemingly on track to eventually eclipse the latter in importance***\n\n\n* ***Ultimately, Fortnite and others have become enablers of a new world in which the peripheral gaming experience often matters most: video streaming, chat, digital cosmetics, microtransactions, etc***\n\n> ## Decentralizing Web2:\n\nThe rise of Roblox – a platform facilitating and hosting user-created games – represents another major industry development. **Roblox boasts an incredible \\~200M monthly active users, with over 70% of user sessions taking place on mobile devices.**\n\nJust as YouTube broke ground by making video content creation open to everyone, Roblox has turned players into builders (though most users are still only players).\n\nRoblox includes its own in-game currency (Robux) that players can use to purchase items in its digital economy.\n\nThe Steam Deck is another fascinating development. \n\n**Built on an open-source operating system (Linux), the Steam Deck offers cross-platform capabilities** for players to access games from a range of developers, as well as older games using emulation software.\n\n**The rise of Cloud Gaming is another emerging trend making gaming accessible to everyone.** Now, players don’t need to invest in expensive hardware to access incredible games anywhere in the world.\n\n* ***These colossal themes playing out are a major reason why Web3 makes sense as the logical successor domain for gaming: the ideological alignment is extraordinary \n ***\n* ***The shift away from expensive hardware and closed ecosystems, the proliferation of a rich social layer, and the quest for creative ownership are inevitably driving the industry towards a blockchain-enabled future***\n\n> ## Play to Earn:\n\nThe blockchain revolution naturally started with financial applications, given the original purpose of Bitcoin itself was to create a peer-to-peer decentralized transaction system. So it shouldn’t be surprising that the tactics that worked early on in DeFi were soon applied to the world of Web3 gaming.\n\n**In particular, two areas saw the most significant amount of early adoption:**\n\n* **Blockchain-enabled marketplaces for in-game digital assets**\n* **Native gaming tokens that had in-game utility but more importantly served to reward early players**\n\nHowever, most of crypto’s early games have largely been built off-chain, with only the digital economies themselves (exchange and settlement) taking place on-chain.\n\n**Ultimately, these games crashed back to earth due to a few key problems:**\n\n* **Terrible gaming experiences centered on yield generation, inevitably attracting short term mercenaries \n **\n* **Poorly thought-out economies with native governance and utility tokens effectively programmed to go to zero \n **\n* **Closed-wall infrastructure that is neither composable nor interoperable**\n\n> ## Where We’ve Fallen Short:\n\nThe approach to date has essentially been to **take DeFi and build narratives with prehistoric graphics and storylines on top of it**. Predictably, this approach fell into a dangerous purgatory, having failed to attract serious players or even durable traders.\n\n**The next phase of Web3 gaming is gravitating towards improved graphics and storylines, as well as better economic design**. \n\nThis new route won’t be a walk in the park either.\n\nBy competing on the DeFi front, games were effectively fighting for attention using yield. This strategy was nearsighted but admittedly worked in a market that could only go up.\n\nBy making graphics and storylines the new industry battleground, Web3 developers are taking on the traditional AAA studios who have an extraordinary head start.\n\nMore importantly, truly crypto-native solutions are less likely to get built this way. This approach feels a lot more like the late ‘90s equivalent of taking every business and throwing “.com” in front of it.\n\n**Builders need to be wary of forcing crypto rails into unnatural use cases.**\n\nThe other issue lies in making gaming an asset-based experience at its core, rather than a social one. By doing so, we create barriers to entry that can be exploited by developers, guilds, speculators, and other potentially malicious actors, thereby derailing crypto’s mission to empower the world.\n\n* ***If crypto-native developers want to win, they need to battle on home ground and on their own terms. Trying to beat the incumbents at their own game is a very challenging (and resource intensive) strategy***\n\n> ## Building On Crypto’s Unfair Advantage:\n\nThe true renaissance will occur as we start leveraging crypto rails to redefine what gaming looks like.\n\n**Part of that centers on the gaming experience:**\n\n* **Interoperability across games** so that players can transport their assets and inventories across different platforms without having to start over. This holds true for identity & in-game achievements as well. This really only works when the game is built entirely on-chain \n \n* **Trustless relationships between players** that conceal strategy and/or protect identity.

In the 3000s BC, Mesopotamians played The Royal Game of Ur on beautifully painted boards, while the Egyptians played Senet.\n\nChaturanga would formally appear in India around 600 AD, though examples of its predecessors date back to 3000 BC. The Persians adopted it as Shatranj before European traders brought it over and turned it into Chess.\n\nAs far back as 2000 BC, Mesoamericans were playing a ballgame on courts. The activity was of immense societal importance, incorporated in rituals and used to resolve conflicts or even war.\n\nThis era also saw Ancient China develop Wei Qi – known today as Go – originally used to practice and refine strategic thinking. Later Chinese dynasties would also invent playing cards and dominoes.\n\n* ***Games have always held enormous societal significance across a variety of contexts – military, social, educational, and entertainment \n ***\n* ***We now think of it as an industry, but throughout the majority of our history gaming was an intrinsic activity that underpinned most of culture \n ***\n* ***We congratulate ourselves for our use of games to teach, train, and connect, when in reality humans have very effectively used games to do all of this for thousands of years \n ***\n* ***Today’s progressive gamification of society – investing, learning, working, collaborating – is really just a revival of an ancient behavior codified in our brains \n ***\n\n> ## Back to the Future:\n\nGerman-American engineer Ralph Baer, inspired by the mass production and ownership of televisions as a key primitive, first envisioned a game that could be played on a home television in 1966. The following year, he and his colleagues at Sanders Associates invented a prototype system known as “The Black Box” – the first multiplayer console video game system, initially licensed under the name of “Magnavox Odyssey.”\n\n* ***This is an important point in the nature of technology: the creation of a new primitive (in this case, televisions) combines with an existing human behavior (gaming) to unlock a universe of new possibilities***\n\nThe Odyssey would soon inspire its competitor Atari to launch its own video game in 1972/3, initially an arcade video game called Pong that would later be turned into a version playable at home.\n\n* ***Both the history and future of gaming are underpinned by social connections: yesterday’s arcades will be tomorrow’s metaverse \n ***\n\n> ## Leveling Up with Composability:\n\nAtari broke new ground in 1977 by launching the Atari 2600 VCS that allowed users to switch out game cartridges via an external ROM slot. Though Atari built dozens of games themselves, their creation of generalizable gaming hardware allowed third-party programmers across the globe to design their own games for the console.\n\nOther novel features included levels with increasing difficulty, scoring systems, and leaderboards, setting the stage for the communities that would soon form around games themselves.\n\n> ## New Entrants:\n\nAn intense wave of consumer demand, fueled by the launch of massively popular games like Space Invaders, was followed by a crash in the industry as excessive hype led to an oversupply of cheap games.\n\nThe crash wouldn’t last long, however, as a new (yet very old) powerhouse would rise from the East.

The Persians adopted it as Shatranj before European traders brought it over and turned it into Chess.\n\nAs far back as 2000 BC, Mesoamericans were playing a ballgame on courts. The activity was of immense societal importance, incorporated in rituals and used to resolve conflicts or even war.\n\nThis era also saw Ancient China develop Wei Qi – known today as Go – originally used to practice and refine strategic thinking. Later Chinese dynasties would also invent playing cards and dominoes.\n\n* ***Games have always held enormous societal significance across a variety of contexts – military, social, educational, and entertainment***\n\n\n* ***We now think of it as an industry, but throughout the majority of our history gaming was an intrinsic activity that underpinned most of culture***\n\n\n* ***We congratulate ourselves for our use of games to teach, train, and connect, when in reality humans have very effectively used games to do all of this for thousands of years***\n\n\n* ***Today’s progressive gamification of society – investing, learning, working, collaborating – is really just a revival of an ancient behavior codified in our brains \n ***\n\n> ## Back to the Future:\n\nGerman-American engineer Ralph Baer, inspired by the mass production and ownership of televisions as a key primitive, first envisioned a game that could be played on a home television in 1966. The following year, he and his colleagues at Sanders Associates invented a prototype system known as “The Black Box” – the first multiplayer console video game system, initially licensed under the name of “Magnavox Odyssey.”\n\n* ***This is an important point in the nature of technology: the creation of a new primitive (in this case, televisions) combines with an existing human behavior (gaming) to unlock a universe of new possibilities***\n\nThe Odyssey would soon inspire its competitor Atari to launch its own video game in 1972/3, initially an arcade video game called Pong that would later be turned into a version playable at home.\n\n* ***Both the history and future of gaming are underpinned by social connections: yesterday’s arcades will be tomorrow’s metaverse \n ***\n\n> ## Leveling Up with Composability:\n\nAtari broke new ground in 1977 by launching the Atari 2600 VCS that allowed users to switch out game cartridges via an external ROM slot. Though Atari built dozens of games themselves, their creation of generalizable gaming hardware allowed third-party programmers across the globe to design their own games for the console.\n\nOther novel features included levels with increasing difficulty, scoring systems, and leaderboards, setting the stage for the communities that would soon form around games themselves. \n \n\n> ## New Entrants:\n\nAn intense wave of consumer demand, fueled by the launch of massively popular games like Space Invaders, was followed by a crash in the industry as excessive hype led to an oversupply of cheap games.\n\nThe crash wouldn’t last long, however, as a new (yet very old) powerhouse would rise from the East. Nintendo, founded in 1889 as a manufacturer of playing cards, launched a number of titles in the early 1980s that would shape the industry forever, including Donkey Kong, Mario Bros., Zelda, and other major titles.\n\nNintendo also launched its own console: the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), featuring significant technological improvements relative to its existing peers.\n\nIn 1989, Nintendo made history once more by releasing the first handheld Game Boy – forever transforming the world of gaming and **setting the stage for the mobile revolution that would come many years later**.\n\nAs we’ll explore later, gaming’s biggest domain has shifted to mobile, paying homage to one of its earliest and most important innovations.\n\n* ***Consoles were never the endgame – they were the intermediate medium while the hardware and software caught up during a long period of intense development \n ***\n\n> ## Upgrading the Stack:\n\nThe console wars of the 1990s saw companies like Sega, Nintendo, and Sony battle for dominance as they leveraged a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem to develop increasingly sophisticated consoles and game franchises.\n\n**In parallel,** **the technological explosion that engulfed the world in the ‘80s and ‘90s saw computers enter millions of homes**.\n\nThe tremendous increase in computing power allowed developers to supercharge their efforts, leading to the dawn of three-dimensional gaming experiences and online play.\n\nAs more homes came online, LAN parties became extremely popular, with players meeting up in person to compete by connecting to the local network.\n\nThe 2000’s saw a new era of console wars, this time between Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation), and Nintendo (Wii), **with** **competition centering on graphics, quality of storyline, and, eventually, the online gaming experience**. Marketplaces sprung up, allowing users to purchase titles or downloadable content, upgrade software, and communicate with other players.\n\nAdvanced open world games with simulated autonomous characters also became extremely popular as a predecessor to the digital metaverse boom we’re seeing today.\n\nPC-based MMORPGs became a global phenomenon in their own right, competing less on graphics or story and more on community, digital identity, and portability.\n\n* ***The explosion in PC gaming offered a glimpse of what billions of users would ultimately prioritize in their gaming experiences \n ***\n\n> ## Going Mobile:\n\nDecreasing computing and hardware costs allowed the global gaming audience to grow exponentially over the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n**Just as the prevalence of personal computers provided a new medium for the industry to expand into, so too did the billions of mobile phones produced in the late 2000s and early 2010s offer a new route for adoption.**\n\nMobile gaming continued where PC-based gaming left off, prioritizing experiences that offered portability, simplicity, and community interaction.\n\n**The rise of mobile phones as the primary computing hardware used by billions of people saw the gaming demographic expand into casual players of all ages, with low-cost games spinning up to meet every user profile.**\n\nThe market for mobile games was worth \\~$120B in 2021 and is expected to triple over the next decade as the computing stack gets even better.\n\n* ***As with TVs before, the mobile transformation offers further proof of a recurring historical pattern: technological infrastructure introduced for one purpose tends to unlock astonishing value across myriad others***\n\n\n* ***Blockchains will likely end up underpinning trillions in value across cultural and social use cases we have yet to imagine, extending well beyond the initial applications in decentralized finance \n ***\n\n> ## Beyond Gaming:\n\nJust as the demographic has expanded tremendously over gaming’s first few decades, so too has its very meaning.\n\n**Two critical developments took place in the late 2010s:**\n\n**1) The ability to integrate real world culture into the game itself**\n\n**2) The creation of in-game economies for digital assets**\n\nFranchises like Fortnite were early pioneers in recognizing that online gaming was as much about the competition as it was about expressing social identity and connecting over cultural movements in an open, digital environment.\n\n* **The industry’s life cycle has seen a steady convergence of social interactions and traditional gaming, with the former seemingly on track to eventually eclipse the latter in importance \n **\n* **Ultimately, Fortnite and others have become enablers of a new world in which the peripheral gaming experience often matters most: video streaming, chat, digital cosmetics, microtransactions, etc \n **\n\n> ## Decentralizing Web2:\n\nThe rise of Roblox – a platform facilitating and hosting user-created games – represents another major industry development. Roblox boasts an incredible \\~200M monthly active users, with over 70% of user sessions taking place on mobile devices.\n\n**Just as YouTube broke ground by making video content creation open to everyone, Roblox has turned players into builders (though most users are still only players).**\n\nRoblox includes its own in-game currency (Robux) that players can use to purchase items in its digital economy.\n\nThe Steam Deck is another fascinating development.\n\nBuilt on an open-source operating system (Linux), the Steam Deck offers cross-platform capabilities for players to access games from a range of developers, as well as older games using emulation software.\n\n**The rise of Cloud Gaming is another emerging trend making gaming accessible to everyone.**\n\nNow, players don’t need to invest in expensive hardware to access incredible games anywhere in the world.\n\n* ***These colossal themes playing out are a major reason why Web3 makes sense as the logical successor domain for gaming: the ideological alignment is extraordinary***\n\n\n* ***The shift away from expensive hardware and closed ecosystems, the proliferation of a rich social layer, and the quest for creative ownership are inevitably driving the industry towards a blockchain-enabled future \n ***\n\n> ## Play to Earn:\n\nThe blockchain revolution naturally started with financial applications, given the original purpose of Bitcoin itself was to create a peer-to-peer decentralized transaction system. So it shouldn’t be surprising that the tactics that worked early on in DeFi were soon applied to the world of Web3 gaming.\n\n**In particular, two areas saw the most significant amount of early adoption:**\n\n* **Blockchain-enabled marketplaces for in-game digital assets \n **\n* **Native gaming tokens that had in-game utility but more importantly served to reward early players**\n\nHowever, most of crypto’s early games have largely been built off-chain, with only the digital economies themselves (exchange and settlement) taking place on-chain.\n\n**Ultimately, these games crashed back to earth due to a few key problems:**\n\n* **Terrible gaming experiences centered on yield generation, inevitably attracting short term mercenaries \n **\n* **Poorly thought-out economies with native governance and utility tokens effectively programmed to go to zero \n **\n* **Closed-wall infrastructure that is neither composable nor interoperable** \n \n\n> ## Where We’ve Fallen Short:\n\nThe approach to date has essentially been to **take DeFi and build narratives with prehistoric graphics and storylines on top of it**. Predictably, this approach fell into a dangerous purgatory, having failed to attract serious players or even durable traders.\n\n**The next phase of Web3 gaming is gravitating towards improved graphics and storylines, as well as better economic design**.\n\nThis new route won’t be a walk in the park either.\n\nBy competing on the DeFi front, games were effectively fighting for attention using yield. This strategy was nearsighted but admittedly worked in a market that could only go up.\n\nBy making graphics and storylines the new industry battleground, Web3 developers are taking on the traditional AAA studios who have an extraordinary head start.\n\nMore importantly, truly crypto-native solutions are less likely to get built this way. This approach feels a lot more like the late ‘90s equivalent of taking every business and throwing “.com” in front of it.\n\n**Builders need to be wary of forcing crypto rails into unnatural use cases.**\n\nThe other issue lies in making gaming an asset-based experience at its core, rather than a social one. By doing so, we create barriers to entry that can be exploited by developers, guilds, speculators, and other potentially malicious actors, thereby derailing crypto’s mission to empower the world.\n\n* ***If crypto-native developers want to win, they need to battle on home ground and on their own terms. Trying to beat the incumbents at their own game is a very challenging (and resource intensive) strategy \n ***\n\n> ## Building On Crypto’s Unfair Advantage:\n\nThe true renaissance will occur as we start leveraging crypto rails to redefine what gaming looks like.\n\n**Part of that centers on the gaming experience:**\n\n* **Interoperability across games** so that players can transport their assets and inventories across different platforms without having to start over. This holds true for identity & in-game achievements as well. This really only works when the game is built entirely on-chain \n \n* **Trustless relationships between players** that conceal strategy and/or protect identity. Zero knowledge technology will be incredibly powerful in enabling these use cases \n \n* **Complete storage of game logic and state on-chain**, removing persistent reliance on developers and creating total transparency around the equality of rules and accomplishments \n \n* Users can shape (and profit from) the direction of games through ***governance or direct economic ownership***\n\n\n* Player inventories and identities become **durable yet dynamic assets** as they experience upgrades or depreciation \n \n* **Games that exist in perpetuity**, free from the constant threat that developers might shut off access \n \n\n**Another component concerns the construction of games:**\n\n* By building games entirely on-chain, **the creativity of users becomes an asset** in itself as players can use open-source game logic and state to build extensions that capture aspects unique to their culture or real-world experiences \n \n* Rather than AAA game developers trying to interpret and incorporate local themes, **players are empowered to organically design personalized environments** that are infinitely more meaningful by leveraging on-chain primitives \n \n* The Atari 2600 encouraged third-party developers around the world to build new games by making the technological (and capital) hurdle minimal \n \n* Importantly, blockchains also provide a mechanism by which ***creators of user generated content can own their work***\n\n\n* Using open-source, interoperable software to tear down the walls that AAA studios have built up will ***set the stage for incredible creativity to flourish around the world \n ***\n\n  This version of reality makes winners out of us all \n \n\n> ## Expanding the Definition:\n\nAnother reason for infinite optimism concerns who gamers will be and what gaming will mean.\n\n**The rise of the mobile phone marked a critical turning point in bringing gaming to an exponentially larger audience**: grandparents and children; teachers and athletes; artists and mathematicians.\n\nThe “what” changed as well.\n\nSophisticated storylines gave way to simple contests like puzzles, spelling bees, chopping fruit, and launching birds.\n\n**We’re likely to see that trend continue, with blockchains expanding deep into the domain of classrooms, board meetings, corporate training, sporting events, identity cultivation, and more.**\n\nThe interoperable and composable nature of truly crypto-native games will see **a wide range of opportunities for diverse individuals to contribute**: clothing designers who can build skins and outfits for open world environments; graphic designers who can craft remarkable new digital realities; musicians who can incorporate their songs into games, etc.\n\n* ***In an ideal world, the sustainable economies of Web3 games will center on organic user generated value, rather than utility tokens designed to inflate to infinity***\n\n\n* ***Blockchain enabled gaming may well prove to be the reserve currency that connects our world through shared, immersive cultural experiences \n ***\n\n> ## Ultimately…\n\nWe’re likely to see hybrid experiments play out in the immediate term. Building compelling games entirely on-chain remains a significant technical challenge, so we can expect **continued innovation around games that primarily live off-chain.**\n\nFurther, expect to see sustained creativity around the question of efficiently recording state changes on-chain while preserving true decentralization and efficient performance.\n\n**Supporting infrastructure will be a particularly exciting field in the coming years:**\n\n* **Cross-game NFT marketplaces**\n* **Interoperability stacks**\n* **Identity primitives derived from in-game activity**\n* **Franchise discovery platforms**\n* **Low-code tooling** / **SDKs**\n* **On/off ramps and specialized wallets**\n\nWhile a number of very talented developer teams are trying to design rich gaming experiences in Web3 native fashion, it may ultimately be that we see **a continuation of the trend of social and peripheral experiences outweighing the importance of deep storylines and stunning graphics.**\n\nIf this proves to the case, however, the on-chain social layer will need to improve drastically. Yields simply aren’t enough to build a sustainable ecosystem of participants.\n\n*The decentralized future is incredible exciting, but we’ll only realize its full potential by building a world for everyone, by everyone.*\n\n* ***History teaches us that the creation of a new technological primitive, when combined with innate human behavior, leads to incredible value creation, with gaming perhaps the most fundamental example of them all***\n\n\n* ***Gaming is a universal experience codified into our brains across millennia of social interactions***\n\n\n* ***We’ve previously explored how the crypto revolution represents a reversion to the earliest principles underpinning human commerce. It’s therefore only natural that one its biggest unlocks sees us return to the roots of our very nature***", "timestamp": 1658176009, "digest": "bp3BQw3P3v0GdVwRoyJ3Z_34_c9RQYYk-xnL8bKhv1Q", "contributor": "0x3385070c3A310a9756BD0C2FfE8B6AdbAd4Ec4f6"}

The activity was of immense societal importance, incorporated in rituals and used to resolve conflicts or even war.\n\nThis era also saw Ancient China develop Wei Qi — known today as Go — originally used to practice and refine strategic thinking.

The following year, he and his colleagues at Sanders Associates invented a prototype system known as “The Black Box” — the first multiplayer console video game system, initially licensed under the name of “Magnavox Odyssey.”\n\n> ***This is an important point in the nature of technology: the creation of a new primitive (in this case, televisions) combines with an existing human behavior (gaming) to unlock a universe of new possibilities***\n\nThe Odyssey would soon inspire its competitor Atari to launch its own video game in 1972/3, initially an arcade video game called Pong that would later be turned into a version playable at home.\n\n> ***Both the history and future of gaming are underpinned by social connections: yesterday’s arcades will be tomorrow’s metaverse***\n\n## *Leveling Up with Composability:*\n\nAtari broke new ground in 1977 by launching the Atari 2600 VCS that allowed users to switch out game cartridges via an external ROM slot. Though Atari built dozens of games themselves, their creation of generalizable gaming hardware allowed third-party programmers across the globe to design their own games for the console.\n\nOther novel features included levels with increasing difficulty, scoring systems, and leaderboards, setting the stage for the communities that would soon form around games themselves.\n\n## *New Entrants:*\n\nAn intense wave of consumer demand, fueled by the launch of massively popular games like Space Invaders, was followed by a crash in the industry as excessive hype led to an oversupply of cheap games.\n\nThe crash wouldn’t last long, however, as a new (yet very old) powerhouse would rise from the East. Nintendo, founded in 1889 as a manufacturer of playing cards, launched a number of titles in the early 1980s that would shape the industry forever, including Donkey Kong, Mario Bros., Zelda, and other major titles.\n\nNintendo also launched its own console: the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), featuring significant technological improvements relative to its existing peers.\n\nIn 1989, Nintendo made history once more by releasing the first handheld Game Boy – **forever transforming the world of gaming and** **setting the stage for the mobile revolution that would come many years later**.\n\nAs we’ll explore later, gaming’s biggest domain has shifted to mobile, paying homage to one of its earliest and most important innovations.\n\n> ***Consoles were never the endgame — they were the intermediate medium while the hardware and software caught up during a long period of intense development***\n\n## *Upgrading the Stack:*\n\nThe console wars of the 1990s saw companies like Sega, Nintendo, and Sony battle for dominance as they leveraged a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem to develop increasingly sophisticated consoles and game franchises.\n\n> **The technological explosion that engulfed the world in the ’80s and ’90s saw computers enter millions of homes**\n\nThe tremendous increase in computing power allowed developers to supercharge their efforts, leading to the dawn of three-dimensional gaming experiences and online play.\n\nAs more homes came online, LAN parties became extremely popular, with players meeting up in person to compete by connecting to the local network.\n\nThe 2000’s saw a new era of console wars, this time between Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation), and Nintendo (Wii), **with** **competition centering on graphics, quality of storyline, and, eventually, the online gaming experience**. Marketplaces sprung up, allowing users to purchase titles or downloadable content, upgrade software, and communicate with other players.\n\nAdvanced open world games with simulated autonomous characters also became extremely popular as a predecessor to the digital metaverse boom we’re seeing today.\n\nPC-based MMORPGs became a global phenomenon in their own right, competing less on graphics or story and more on community, digital identity, and portability.\n\n> ***The explosion in PC gaming offered a glimpse of what billions of users would ultimately prioritize in their gaming experiences***\n\n## *Going Mobile:*\n\nDecreasing computing and hardware costs allowed the global gaming audience to grow exponentially over the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n**Just as the prevalence of personal computers provided a new medium for the industry to expand into, so too did the billions of mobile phones produced in the late 2000s and early 2010s offer a new route for adoption.**\n\nMobile gaming continued where PC-based gaming left off, prioritizing experiences that offered portability, simplicity, and community interaction.\n\n**The rise of mobile phones as the primary computing hardware used by billions of people saw the gaming demographic expand into casual players of all ages, with low-cost games spinning up to meet every user profile.**\n\nThe market for mobile games was worth \\~$120B in 2021 and is expected to triple over the next decade as the computing stack gets even better.\n\n> ***As with TVs before, the mobile transformation offers further proof of a recurring historical pattern: technological infrastructure introduced for one purpose tends to unlock astonishing value across myriad others***\n\n> ***Blockchains will likely end up underpinning trillions in value across cultural and social use cases we have yet to imagine, extending well beyond the initial applications in decentralized finance***\n\n## *Beyond Gaming:*\n\nJust as the demographic has expanded tremendously over gaming’s first few decades, so too has its very meaning.\n\n**Two critical developments took place in the late 2010s:**\n\n**1) The ability to integrate real world culture into the game itself**\n\n**2) The creation of in-game economies for digital assets**\n\nFranchises like Fortnite were early pioneers in recognizing that online gaming was as much about the competition as it was about expressing social identity and connecting over cultural movements in an open, digital environment.\n\n> ***The industry’s life cycle has seen a steady convergence of social interactions and traditional gaming, with the former seemingly on track to eventually eclipse the latter in importance***\n\n> ***Ultimately, Fortnite and others have become enablers of a new world in which the peripheral gaming experience often matters most: video streaming, chat, digital cosmetics, microtransactions, etc***\n\n## *Decentralizing Web2:*\n\nThe rise of Roblox — a platform facilitating and hosting user-created games — represents another major industry development. Roblox boasts an incredible \\~200M monthly active users, with over 70% of user sessions taking place on mobile devices.\n\n**Just as YouTube broke ground by making video content creation open to everyone, Roblox has turned players into builders (though most users are still only players).**\n\nRoblox includes its own in-game currency (Robux) that players can use to purchase items in its digital economy.\n\nThe Steam Deck is another fascinating development.\n\nBuilt on an open-source operating system (Linux), the Steam Deck offers cross-platform capabilities for players to access games from a range of developers, as well as older games using emulation software.\n\n**The rise of Cloud Gaming is another emerging trend making gaming accessible to everyone.**\n\nNow, players don’t need to invest in expensive hardware to access incredible games anywhere in the world.\n\n> ***These colossal themes playing out are a major reason why Web3 makes sense as the logical successor domain for gaming: the ideological alignment is extraordinary***\n>\n> ***The shift away from expensive hardware and closed ecosystems, the proliferation of a rich social layer, and the quest for creative ownership are inevitably driving the industry towards a blockchain-enabled future***\n\n## *Play to Earn:*\n\nThe blockchain revolution naturally started with financial applications, given the original purpose of Bitcoin itself was to create a peer-to-peer decentralized transaction system. So it shouldn’t be surprising that the tactics that worked early on in DeFi were soon applied to the world of Web3 gaming.\n\n> **In particular, two areas saw the most significant amount of early adoption:**\n\n* **Blockchain-enabled marketplaces for in-game digital assets \n **\n* **Native gaming tokens that had in-game utility but more importantly served to reward early players**\n\nHowever, most of crypto’s early games have largely been built off-chain, with only the digital economies themselves (exchange and settlement) taking place on-chain.\n\n> **Ultimately, these games crashed back to earth due to a few key problems:**\n\n* **Terrible gaming experiences centered on yield generation, inevitably attracting short term mercenaries \n **\n* **Poorly thought-out economies with native governance and utility tokens effectively programmed to go to zero \n **\n* **Closed-wall infrastructure that is neither composable nor interoperable**\n\n## *Where We’ve Fallen Short:*\n\nThe approach to date has essentially been to **take DeFi and build narratives with prehistoric graphics and storylines on top of it**. Predictably, this approach fell into a dangerous purgatory, having failed to attract serious players or even durable traders.\n\n> **The next phase of Web3 gaming is gravitating towards improved graphics and storylines, as well as better economic design**\n\nThis new route won’t be a walk in the park either.\n\nBy competing on the DeFi front, games were effectively fighting for attention using yield. This strategy was nearsighted but admittedly worked in a market that could only go up.\n\n> **By making graphics and storylines the new industry battleground, Web3 developers are taking on the traditional AAA studios who have an extraordinary head start.**\n\nMore importantly, truly crypto-native solutions are less likely to get built this way. This approach feels a lot more like the late ’90s equivalent of taking every business and throwing “.com” in front of it.\n\n**Builders need to be wary of forcing crypto rails into unnatural use cases.**\n\nThe other issue lies in making gaming an asset-based experience at its core, rather than a social one. By doing so, we create barriers to entry that can be exploited by developers, guilds, speculators, and other potentially malicious actors, thereby derailing crypto’s mission to empower the world.\n\n> ***If crypto-native developers want to win, they need to battle on home ground and on their own terms. Trying to beat the incumbents at their own game is a very challenging (and resource intensive) strategy***\n\n## *Building On Crypto’s Unfair Advantage:*\n\nThe true renaissance will occur as we start leveraging crypto rails to redefine what gaming looks like.\n\n> ***Part of that centers on the gaming experience:***\n\n* **Interoperability across games** so that players can transport their assets and inventories across different platforms without having to start over. This holds true for identity & in-game achievements as well \n \n* **Trustless relationships between players** that conceal strategy and/or protect identity.

Nintendo, founded in 1889 as a manufacturer of playing cards, launched a number of titles in the early 1980s that would shape the industry forever, including Donkey Kong, Mario Bros., Zelda, and other major titles.\n\nNintendo also launched its own console: the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), featuring significant technological improvements relative to its existing peers.\n\nIn 1989, Nintendo made history once more by releasing the first handheld Game Boy – **forever transforming the world of gaming and** **setting the stage for the mobile revolution that would come many years later**.\n\nAs we’ll explore later, gaming’s biggest domain has shifted to mobile, paying homage to one of its earliest and most important innovations.\n\n> ***Consoles were never the endgame — they were the intermediate medium while the hardware and software caught up during a long period of intense development***\n\n## *Upgrading the Stack:*\n\nThe console wars of the 1990s saw companies like Sega, Nintendo, and Sony battle for dominance as they leveraged a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem to develop increasingly sophisticated consoles and game franchises.\n\n> **The technological explosion that engulfed the world in the ’80s and ’90s saw computers enter millions of homes**\n\nThe tremendous increase in computing power allowed developers to supercharge their efforts, leading to the dawn of three-dimensional gaming experiences and online play.\n\nAs more homes came online, LAN parties became extremely popular, with players meeting up in person to compete by connecting to the local network.\n\nThe 2000’s saw a new era of console wars, this time between Microsoft (Xbox), Sony (Playstation), and Nintendo (Wii), **with** **competition centering on graphics, quality of storyline, and, eventually, the online gaming experience**. Marketplaces sprung up, allowing users to purchase titles or downloadable content, upgrade software, and communicate with other players.\n\nAdvanced open world games with simulated autonomous characters also became extremely popular as a predecessor to the digital metaverse boom we’re seeing today.\n\nPC-based MMORPGs became a global phenomenon in their own right, competing less on graphics or story and more on community, digital identity, and portability.\n\n> ***The explosion in PC gaming offered a glimpse of what billions of users would ultimately prioritize in their gaming experiences***\n\n## *Going Mobile:*\n\nDecreasing computing and hardware costs allowed the global gaming audience to grow exponentially over the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n**Just as the prevalence of personal computers provided a new medium for the industry to expand into, so too did the billions of mobile phones produced in the late 2000s and early 2010s offer a new route for adoption.**\n\nMobile gaming continued where PC-based gaming left off, prioritizing experiences that offered portability, simplicity, and community interaction.\n\n**The rise of mobile phones as the primary computing hardware used by billions of people saw the gaming demographic expand into casual players of all ages, with low-cost games spinning up to meet every user profile.**\n\nThe market for mobile games was worth \\~$120B in 2021 and is expected to triple over the next decade as the computing stack gets even better.\n\n> ***As with TVs before, the mobile transformation offers further proof of a recurring historical pattern: technological infrastructure introduced for one purpose tends to unlock astonishing value across myriad others***\n\n> ***Blockchains will likely end up underpinning trillions in value across cultural and social use cases we have yet to imagine, extending well beyond the initial applications in decentralized finance***\n\n## *Beyond Gaming:*\n\nJust as the demographic has expanded tremendously over gaming’s first few decades, so too has its very meaning.\n\n**Two critical developments took place in the late 2010s:**\n\n**1) The ability to integrate real world culture into the game itself**\n\n**2) The creation of in-game economies for digital assets**\n\nFranchises like Fortnite were early pioneers in recognizing that online gaming was as much about the competition as it was about expressing social identity and connecting over cultural movements in an open, digital environment.\n\n> ***The industry’s life cycle has seen a steady convergence of social interactions and traditional gaming, with the former seemingly on track to eventually eclipse the latter in importance***\n\n> ***Ultimately, Fortnite and others have become enablers of a new world in which the peripheral gaming experience often matters most: video streaming, chat, digital cosmetics, microtransactions, etc***\n\n## *Decentralizing Web2:*\n\nThe rise of Roblox — a platform facilitating and hosting user-created games — represents another major industry development. Roblox boasts an incredible \\~200M monthly active users, with over 70% of user sessions taking place on mobile devices.\n\n**Just as YouTube broke ground by making video content creation open to everyone, Roblox has turned players into builders (though most users are still only players).**\n\nRoblox includes its own in-game currency (Robux) that players can use to purchase items in its digital economy.\n\nThe Steam Deck is another fascinating development.\n\nBuilt on an open-source operating system (Linux), the Steam Deck offers cross-platform capabilities for players to access games from a range of developers, as well as older games using emulation software.\n\n**The rise of Cloud Gaming is another emerging trend making gaming accessible to everyone.**\n\nNow, players don’t need to invest in expensive hardware to access incredible games anywhere in the world.\n\n> ***These colossal themes playing out are a major reason why Web3 makes sense as the logical successor domain for gaming: the ideological alignment is extraordinary***\n>\n> ***The shift away from expensive hardware and closed ecosystems, the proliferation of a rich social layer, and the quest for creative ownership are inevitably driving the industry towards a blockchain-enabled future***\n\n## *Play to Earn:*\n\nThe blockchain revolution naturally started with financial applications, given the original purpose of Bitcoin itself was to create a peer-to-peer decentralized transaction system. So it shouldn’t be surprising that the tactics that worked early on in DeFi were soon applied to the world of Web3 gaming.\n\n> **In particular, two areas saw the most significant amount of early adoption:**\n\n* **Blockchain-enabled marketplaces for in-game digital assets \n **\n* **Native gaming tokens that had in-game utility but more importantly served to reward early players**\n\nHowever, most of crypto’s early games have largely been built off-chain, with only the digital economies themselves (exchange and settlement) taking place on-chain.\n\n> **Ultimately, these games crashed back to earth due to a few key problems:**\n\n* **Terrible gaming experiences centered on yield generation, inevitably attracting short term mercenaries \n **\n* **Poorly thought-out economies with native governance and utility tokens effectively programmed to go to zero \n **\n* **Closed-wall infrastructure that is neither composable nor interoperable**\n\n## *Where We’ve Fallen Short:*\n\nThe approach to date has essentially been to **take DeFi and build narratives with prehistoric graphics and storylines on top of it**. Predictably, this approach fell into a dangerous purgatory, having failed to attract serious players or even durable traders.\n\n> **The next phase of Web3 gaming is gravitating towards improved graphics and storylines, as well as better economic design**\n\nThis new route won’t be a walk in the park either.\n\nBy competing on the DeFi front, games were effectively fighting for attention using yield. This strategy was nearsighted but admittedly worked in a market that could only go up.\n\n> **By making graphics and storylines the new industry battleground, Web3 developers are taking on the traditional AAA studios who have an extraordinary head start.**\n\nMore importantly, truly crypto-native solutions are less likely to get built this way. This approach feels a lot more like the late ’90s equivalent of taking every business and throwing “.com” in front of it.\n\n**Builders need to be wary of forcing crypto rails into unnatural use cases.**\n\nThe other issue lies in making gaming an asset-based experience at its core, rather than a social one. By doing so, we create barriers to entry that can be exploited by developers, guilds, speculators, and other potentially malicious actors, thereby derailing crypto’s mission to empower the world.\n\n> ***If crypto-native developers want to win, they need to battle on home ground and on their own terms. Trying to beat the incumbents at their own game is a very challenging (and resource intensive) strategy***\n\n## *Building On Crypto’s Unfair Advantage:*\n\nThe true renaissance will occur as we start leveraging crypto rails to redefine what gaming looks like.\n\n> ***Part of that centers on the gaming experience:***\n\n* **Interoperability across games** so that players can transport their assets and inventories across different platforms without having to start over. This holds true for identity & in-game achievements as well \n \n* **Trustless relationships between players** that conceal strategy and/or protect identity. Zero knowledge technology will be incredibly powerful in enabling these use cases \n \n* **Complete storage of game logic and state on-chain**, removing persistent reliance on developers and creating total transparency around the equality of rules and accomplishments \n \n* Users can shape (and profit from) the direction of games through **governance or direct economic ownership \n **\n* Player inventories and identities become **durable yet dynamic assets** as they experience upgrades or depreciation \n \n* **Games that exist in perpetuity**, free from the constant threat that developers might shut off access\n\n> ***Another component concerns the construction of games:***\n\n* By building games entirely on-chain, **the creativity of users becomes an asset** in itself as players can use open-source game logic and state to build extensions that capture aspects unique to their culture or real-world experiences \n \n* Rather than AAA game developers trying to interpret and incorporate local themes, **players are empowered to organically design personalized environments** that are infinitely more meaningful by leveraging on-chain primitives \n \n* The Atari 2600 encouraged third-party developers around the world to build new games by making the technological (and capital) hurdle minimal \n \n* Importantly, blockchains also provide a mechanism by which **creators of user generated content can own their work** \n \n* Using open-source, interoperable software to tear down the walls that AAA studios have built up will **set the stage for incredible creativity to flourish around the world.**\n\nThis version of reality makes winners out of us all\n\n## *Expanding the Definition:*\n\nAnother reason for infinite optimism concerns who gamers will be and what gaming will mean.\n\n**The rise of the mobile phone marked a critical turning point in bringing gaming to an exponentially larger audience**: grandparents and children; teachers and athletes; artists and mathematicians.\n\n**The “what” changed as well.**\n\nSophisticated storylines gave way to simple contests like puzzles, spelling bees, chopping fruit, and launching birds.\n\n**We’re likely to see that trend continue, with blockchains expanding deep into the domain of classrooms, board meetings, corporate training, sporting events, identity cultivation, and more.**\n\nThe interoperable and composable nature of truly crypto-native games will see a **wide range of opportunities for diverse individuals to contribute**\n\nClothing designers who can build skins and outfits for open world environments; graphic designers who can craft remarkable new digital realities; musicians who can incorporate their songs into games, etc.\n\n> ***In an ideal world, the sustainable economies of Web3 games will center on organic user generated value, rather than utility tokens designed to inflate to infinity***\n>\n> ***Blockchain enabled gaming may well prove to be the reserve currency that connects our world through shared, immersive cultural experiences***\n\n## *Ultimately…*\n\nWe’re likely to see hybrid experiments play out in the immediate term. Building compelling games entirely on-chain remains a significant technical challenge, so we can expect **continued innovation around games that primarily live off-chain.**\n\nFurther, expect to see sustained creativity around the question of **efficiently recording state changes on-chain** while preserving true decentralization and efficient performance.\n\n> **Supporting infrastructure will be a particularly exciting field in the coming years:**\n\n* **Cross-game NFT marketplaces**\n* **Interoperability stacks**\n* **Identity primitives derived from in-game activity**\n* **Franchise discovery platforms**\n* **Low-code tooling** / **SDKs**\n* **On/off ramps and specialized wallets**\n\n**While a number of very talented developer teams are trying to design rich gaming experiences in Web3 native fashion, it may ultimately be that we see a continuation of the trend of social and peripheral experiences outweighing the importance of deep storylines and stunning graphics.**\n\nIf this proves to the case, however, the on-chain social layer will need to improve drastically. Yields simply aren’t enough to build a sustainable ecosystem of participants.\n\nThe decentralized future is incredible exciting, but we’ll only realize its full potential by building a world for everyone, by everyone.\n\n> ***History teaches us that the creation of a new technological primitive, when combined with innate human behavior, leads to incredible value creation, with gaming perhaps the most fundamental example of them all***\n>\n> ***Gaming is a universal experience codified into our brains across millennia of social interactions***\n>\n> ***[We’ve previously explored how the crypto revolution represents a reversion to the earliest principles underpinning human commerce.](https://mirror.xyz/byzantineghost.eth/ompQ7hLHnenMTHcj9tHx18Y_UcUBVKDEmxh0HlOFrh4)***\n>\n> **It’s therefore only natural that one its biggest unlocks sees us return to the roots of our very nature**", "timestamp": 1658177525, "digest": "BX5cHouRWoLR7YNzvt4W0fjvLfvrIEKkdQp-ZbUTjvo", "contributor": "0x3385070c3A310a9756BD0C2FfE8B6AdbAd4Ec4f6"}

Therefore, most of our efforts to raise the floor price would be in vain, because at the slightest opportunity for profit, these bots would put the Skribbles they have minted up for sale. This would make it long and exhausting to get the floor price of our collection to increase.\n\nSecondly, the collection we’re currently working on has a completely different artistic direction. Therefore, we have to adapt our identity with this new collection for consistency and to avoid confusing newcomers. That's why we are going to reorganize our networks, our website, and our branding in general. The Skribbles will remain the backbone of our ecosystem until the mint of our new collection.\n\nFinally, we have real ambitions for this new project. We want it to bring tangible utility to its holders. This is why it is essential to raise funds. This would allow us to hire more staff and alphas callers, create large-scale partnerships with big projects and simply continue to pursue the creation of great opportunities for our holders.\n\nDon't worry — the collection will remain completely free to all Skribbles holders who meet the eligibility requirements.\n\n**Step 2 - The Free Mint (For Skribbles Holders Only)**\n\nOnce we have redesigned our entire branding, and recruited all the people we need to get our second collection off the ground, we will start to communicate with the world, launch partnerships with other projects and distribute whitelists to the most active and engaged members.\n\nStarting in mid-August, we will do our maximum to develop the community as well as to finish the collection we are working on.\n\nThe free mint will take place around mid-September.\n\nWe will reserve 1444 NFTs for our existing community, namely the Skribbles holders and those who have been hand selected to be part of the adventure due to their implication in the project.\n\nBy the way, we will reveal the name of the collection and the first sneak peeks soon.\n\n**Step 3 - The Public Sale**\n\nThere will be a public sale for the rest of the supply. We plan to supply a maximum of 4444 NFTs in total for this new collection. So to sum up, 1444 for the Skribbles holders and 3000 for the public sale. We think it is healthier to have a smaller supply. The price has yet to be defined.\n\nThe public sale will take place two weeks after the free mint, by the end of September.\n\nThe time between the free mint and the public sale will be crucial. This will be the time to act as a close-knit community and all together keep our floor high as well as raise the hype around our project.\n\nThis time, we'll do everything we can to prevent bots from being part of the public sale. We will use Premint or a similar service to make a raffle with a minimum requirements to limit the possibility of bots entering our collection.\n\n**Step 4 - The Beginning**\n\nWe want to make this new collection a real brand, we want to organize events, become a private and exclusive circle with the best alpha callers in the business, continue to partner with the biggest NFTs projects as well as brands, but most of all, we want to send you incredible new collections totally free - for all holders.\n\nBecause after all, we are creative, artists and that's why we got into NFTs. To make beautiful stuff and to have fun. One thing is for sure, we want to continuously improve the quality of the art of the collections we will create in the future.\n\nWe will continue to update this roadmap over time so you can continue to see what we are working on and what our plans are.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this article.\n\nYou can't imagine how much we appreciate your presence and support.\n\n— The Skribble Team", "timestamp": 1658179527, "digest": "HmyOB9Dj3TvSsZVxfhEGAsz1L9x4aP4ZPZARo9ObovE", "contributor": "0xf637f28A4Deaf104D22d1468B4d18CadA38eBE8c"}

{"id": "Ta_W6-940Unqx0oXSlYXYxWUh0YsKVcAgavMLzntOPc", "title": "Gnosis Multisig - czym jest, gdzie ma zastosowanie. I czy można na tym przy okazji coś zarobić?", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m6F768_B8zWA_YwrQ0o88.jpg?height=1935&width=3571)\n\n> **Technologia Multisig**, wychodzi z założenia, że trzymanie środków na jednym kluczu to niezbyt bezpieczne rozwiązanie. Multisig zamiast jednego klucza prywatnego, proponuje kilka jednocześnie. Aby wypłacić środki z multisiga potrzeba podpisów z kilku walletów *(w zależności ile dodaliśmy podczas otwierania multisiga)*. **Przykład** \\*- tworzymy \\*multisiga **3/5** oznacza to, że aby wypłacić assety potrzeba **3 z 5 podpisów**.W tym  przypadku gdy w jakiś sposób utracimy 1 lub 2 klucze, nadal będziemy w stanie odzyskać środki, ponieważ mamy dostęp do 3 pozostałych kluczy a w naszej konfiguracji to (3/5) to wystarczy na dokonanie transakcji. Zastosowań jest tutaj dużo. Opiszę kilka z nich. Najpopularniejszy i moim zdaniem najbezpieczniejszy Multisig to GnosisSafe. Co nie oznacza, że nie ma innych. Jest i to całkiem sporo. BitGo, Coinbase, Armory, DarkWallet & GreenAddress.\n\n## Zastosowań jest wiele. Dziś opiszę #4 najpopularniejsze:\n\n1️⃣ **Fundusze VC & Grupy** wspólnie inwestujące w **private sale czy seedy**.Ten przykład będzie bardziej przyziemny z większym utility jeżeli chodzi o moją grupę docelową, dla której piszę ten artykuł. Wyobraź sobie, że masz grupę discordową. Nikt nikogo nie zna w realu, znacie się tylko z avatarów. Chcecie zainwestować w projekt, jednak próg wejścia to **$25K,** a więc trzeba połączyć siły i zainwestować wspólnie. Problemem jest kto będzie posiadaczem głównego walletu, na który będą wpadać tokeny z inwestycji czy środki ze zbiórki. I tutaj rozwiązaniem jest multisig. Przykładu chyba nie muszę opisywać co? W skrócie macie np 20osób w grupie. Tworzycie multisig 7/12 i podpisy należą dla najbardziej zaufanych i zasłużonych członków grupy. Tutaj opcji jest wiele. W tym temacie jest jedno zagrożenie. Więc żeby nie było HOPIUM to opiszę nasz własny case. Zainwestowaliśmy w projekt poprzez multisig. Podczas dystrybucji tokenów - **zonk! Gnosis Multisig** nie jest kompatybilny z metamaskiem jeżeli chodzi o główny kontrakt multisig. Adres ten był podany w umowie jako ‘odbiór tokenów’. Same wallety do podpisów multisiga są jak najbardziej kompatybilne z metamask. Można nimi podpisywać transakcje jednak sam kontrakt multisig tej kompatybilności z metamask nie ma. Po listingu, dostaliśmy stronę, na której był claim zakupionych tokenów. I tu pojawił się problem, ponieważ na stronie do claimowania był tylko metamask, którego nie obsługiwał gnosis 🤯 Długo szukaliśmy rozwiązania i docelowo się udało. Claimu dokonałem poprzez wywołanie transakcji manualnie. Tutaj jednak potrzebna wiedza techniczna i kod od twórców projektu. Śliski temat, ale mi się udało! 👏 Z wysłaniem tokenów z multisiga na giełdę czy inny wallet już nie było problemu, do tego są potrzebne podpisy (metamask). **Jaką lekcje z tego wyciągneliśmy ?** Przed inwestycją w projekt poprzez multisig należy pytać projektu, czy tokeny będą do nas wysłane, czy będziemy musieli je sami claimować. Jeśli opcja numer 2 to słabo i tutaj raczej nie używałbym multisiga!\n\n2️⃣ **Cyber-ataki na giełdy.** Potencjalny haker, łamiąc zabezpieczenia np. CEXA, wejdzie w posiadanie tylko pojedynczego klucza. Do wyciągnięcia środków giełdy często stosują kilka podpisów, więc wyciągnięcie środków często jest niemożliwe. Dodatkowo istnieje możliwość zabezpieczenia multisiga poprzez 2FA co czyni atak jeszcze bardziej trudnym.\n\n3️⃣ **Zabezpieczenie płatności w darknecie** *\\[escrow\\]* . Wiadomo na darknecie bardzo ciężko o zaufanie płacąc za towar/usugę osobie, której nie znamy. A więc dzięki multisigowi można ograniczyć ryzyko z tym związane. Serwisy czy marketplace oferują swojego zaufanego *depozytariusza,* który jest pośrednikiem w tranacakcji. Z jednej strony jesteś ty jako *kupujący.* Po drugiej stronie jest sprzedający, a pomiędzy *depozytariusz,* który rozwiązuje dany spór jeśli do takiego by doszło. Jeśli transakcja odbywa się bez żadnych komplikacji, obie jej strony *kupujący i sprzedający* realizują płatność z wykorzystaniem posiadanych przez siebie kluczy. Tutaj najpopularniejszą konfiguracją jest 3 z 3 kluczy. W przypadku problemów z realizacją transakcji *depozytariusz* rozstrzyga, kto ma racje. Gdy obie strony dochodzą do porozumienia i są happy z transakcji to stroną trzecia dokonuje  dostatniego podpisu, po czym transakcja przechodzi.\n\nPosłużę się tutaj prostym przykładem. W transakcji biorą udział 3 strony: sprzedający, kupujący i depozytariusz. W momencie dokonywania deala, system generuje adres multisigowy. Każda ze stron dodaje swój klucz prywatny po czym otrzymuje fragment klucza. Kupujący wysyła np ETH na wygenerowany adres multisig. Sprzedający posiadając tylko 1/3 wymaganych kluczy nie może claimować tego assetu. Potwierdzenie przez stronę kupującą, że otrzymał towar/usługę powoduje 2 podpis. W przypadku sporu (np. sprzedawca twierdzi, że wysłał towar, lecz kupujący nie potwierdza otrzymania towaru) to depozytariusz decyduje komu przekazać swój klucz. Jeżeli depozytariusz uzna, że sprzedawca nie wysłał towaru. Nie ma potwierdzenia wysyłki lub wysłał kupe,  to klucz przekazywany jest kupującemu i odzyskuje on swoje pieniądze. Tacy depozytariusze dbają też o swoją renomę, zbierają feedbacki i trust. W przeciwnym wypadku klucz trafia do sprzedającego i otrzymuje on asset za tą usługę. Ma to sens co? Tyle teorii, na koniec dodam, że w praktyce działa to bardzo fajnie. Chociażby na naszej polskiej cebuli.\n\n4️⃣ **Bezpieczna przystań dla assetów w longterm.** Na koniec jeszcze jeden przykład użycia multisig. Wyobraź sobie, że trzymasz ETH, wBTC, sporo stabli i inne assety. Chcesz to trzymać w longterm i nic z tym nie robić. Jeśli wartość assetów jest spora tutaj też przychodzi z rozwiązaniem multisig. Trzymając te wszystkie assety na jednym wallecie, tracąc dostęp czy padając ofiarą hacku tracimy wszystko. Wystarczy, że ktoś wykradnie twój klucz prywatny czy seed. Aby się zabezpieczyć, można tutaj użyć multisig np 2/3 gdzie jednym kluczem byłby wallet z ledgera, drugim z trezora, a trzecim jeszcze coś innego. Aby wypłacić assety z multisiga potrzebujemy w tym przypadku 2z3 kluczy. Więc nawet jak by ktoś zdobył jeden klucz - nie będzie w stanie wypłacić środków!\n\n> Przykładów użycia jest dużo więcej, ale na tym zakończę. Celem tego wpisu jest nie tylko opisanie tego czym jest i jak działa multisig, ale również potencjalna spekulacja. Pamiętasz #airdrop Optimism? Jednym z punktów dla osób, które dostały tego dropa był właśnie multisig. Ci co podpisali jakąś transakcje poprzez multisig dostali **1190 $OP**. Dzisiejsza wartość to około **$1666**. Jako, że z multisiga korzystałem wcześniej, to i udało mi się zakwalifikować!  🦾\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z8a0SCY6fpyPUvD_PDcys.png?height=640&width=1038)\n\n> ### Czy inne projekty, mogą pójść podobną drogą i sypnąć tokenami dla userów, którzy korzystają z tego rozwiązania? Jest na to duża szansa. Multisig na chwilę obecną to nadal wąska grupa, a więc i potencjał na sytego dropa jest wyższy (drop rozmyty na mniejszą ilość wosób)\n\n🚩 Tutaj też, aby nie było tak wesoło — widzę  **zagrożenie** 🧐Wyobraź sobie, że masz hmm 5 walletów, z których korzystasz na co dzień. Robisz więc multisig 3/5 lub 4/5, po czym dokonujesz transakcji, aby zaszła interakcja z kontraktem. Wystawiasz się tym na potencjalnego dropa - super!\n\nZ drugiej strony jednak, adresy te poprzez multisig są w jakimś stopniu ze sobą powiązane. Wiecie, sybil i te sprawy 🙃I tutaj rozkmina. @[0xKubi](https://twitter.com/0xKubi) & @[TomKowalczyk](https://twitter.com/tomkowalczyk) będziemy bardzo wdzięczni za wasz feedback w tym temacie! 🙏\n\n**Pamiętaj, wszyscy jesteśmy tutaj for tech, yeees ser?** Zanim zaczniemy tworzyć i korzystać fajnie by było to dobrze rozkminić. Pomysłów jest kilka. Jeden z nich to stworzenie nowych walletów pod multisiga + jeden z którego korzystamy na co dzień, aby nie linkować. Kolejny to użyć adresy, które używamy na codzień, ale to kwestia do przegadania z bardziej technicznymi osobami. Osobiście będę tworzył kolejnego multisiga, ale nad strukturą cały czas pracuje. Czekam też na tańszy gaz u Vitalika. Fajnie jak by się rozkręciła dyskusja/burza mózgów w tym temacie pod tweetem.\n\n## 🗣 I na koniec instrukcja jak stworzyć multisiga 💭\n\n### \n\n1️⃣ Łączymy portfel na [gnosis-safe.io/app](https://gnosis-safe.io/app)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iCbDNRDMVDrV8krQIWRaf.png?height=893&width=963)\n\n2️⃣ Łączymy portfel podpisujący (np.Metamask). Będzie to też wallet z pierwszym podpisem.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mzXdnKlNeRqnb4In1mf16.png?height=709&width=1925)\n\n3️⃣ Wybieramy wallety do podpisów multisiga. Ten krok jest mega ważny, ponieważ są to adresy, które mają uprawnienia do przesyłania i zatwierdzania transakcji (możesz później usunąć lub zastąpić te adresy). Twój połączony portfel został już dodany jako pierwszy signer, ale możesz go również zmienić. Dodaj dowolną liczbę walletów, wklejając adres Ethereum lub wpisując nazwę ENS.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gkOyOBEqj3xoRuouvw4h6.png?height=1299&width=1697)\n\n4️⃣ Zdefiniuj liczbę potrzebnych walletów do podpisania transakcji zanim zostanie potwierdzona. Pamiętaj, aby dokładnie przemyśleć strukturę! Jeśli nie będziesz mieć dostępu do zdefiniowanej liczby podpisów — **nie będziesz w stanie odzyskać swoich zasobów!** 🚩\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ePQHTQCvAFtvty5dXi2aB.png?height=252&width=607)\n\n5️⃣ Na koniec przejrzyj na spokojnie swoje wallety i parametry multisiga. Jeśli wszystko jest tak jak sobie tego życzysz - postępuj zgodnie z instrukcją i zatwierdź transakcje tworzenia kontraktu multisig.\n\n6️⃣ Po stworzeniu multisiga możesz [TUTAJ](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/welcome) się do niego zalogować swoim walletem podpisującym. Po zalogowaniu zostaniesz przeniesiony do dappsa gdzie możesz zarządzać swoim multisigiem. A wygląda to tak  👇\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OYhXy7VmiJKkLGqglYApM.png?height=1054&width=3158)\n\n### 👉 Gnosis oferuje multisig nie tylko na mainecie ale i Polygon, BNB, EnergyWebChain, GnosisChain, Arbitrum, Aurora, Avax, Optimism no i testnety Goerli & Rinkeby 👈\n\nTo by było na tyle.

{"id": "ln3EhXgP-Aveu-mYCoD2V5HRuQbht8XTKtB8AFIgOtI", "title": "From Chicago’s South Side to Tech & Web3: The Journey of a First-Gen Low-Income Mexican-American", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d4U-AghG5-knKE5RxeUbC.png?height=551&width=527)\n\nI decided to share my story because I don’t think there are enough stories of youth, who in their attempt to grow up quickly, make costly mistakes, yet still end up with jobs in Investment Banking, Tech, or Venture Capital.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m luckier than a rabbit foot wrapped in a four-leaf clover inside a rainbow. But I’ve also lost family and friends to gang violence, and I don’t take it for granted that I get to wake up every day to do the things I’m able to do.\n\n## From California’s Strawberry Fields to Chicago’s South Side\n\nMy story starts with my Dad coming to the US in search of opportunities outside of his small ranch town in Guanajuato, MX. As an older sibling, he was pulled out of middle school to look after his younger siblings and the family livestock.\n\nHe had greater ambitions for himself and his family, so in his early 20’s, he crossed the border to work in the strawberry fields of California. He worked tirelessly to do a job many Americans wouldn’t dream of doing, and for it he fought deportation every day.\n\nHe’s never been the giving up type (something I’ve inherited from him), and eventually he made his way to the steel factories on Chicago’s South Side. He saved up enough money to bring my mom to the US, and there on the South Side is where I was born and raised.\n\nLike many kids in Chicago, I grew up with gangs. I’ve only begun to understand how that’s shaped my life. Around the neighborhood, we had the Vice Lords, the Latin Kings, the Gangster Disciples (GD’s), and the Latin Dragons. Those names might not mean much to you, but in 2021, there were more than 3,500 shootings and 800 homicides in Chicago, concentrated in neighborhoods like mine, driven by names like those.\n\nGrowing up in these environments, you’re just looking to survive. You do things like avoid certain streets, hide valuables when traveling, always watch your back, and limit time outside after dark. If you’re wondering about crime enforcement, I’ve had a gun pointed at me twice in my life for no reason, once by a gangbanger, and once by a cop.\n\nIt’s hard to focus on schoolwork when this is your normal, but it’s school that helped me change my circumstances. I’ve always had a growth mindset and was able to test into a magnet public high school by the name of Whitney M Young. It required that I take the train four hours every day, but it was my ticket out of the neighborhood.\n\n## High School\n\nAt Whitney Young, I felt safe, which led me to deprioritize school work. I began capitalizing on my newfound freedom by selling mixtapes, designer clothes, iPods, bootleg this, and bootleg that. I started cutting classes, then failed a couple classes, then went to summer school, twice.\n\nEventually my recklessness caught up with me and I was almost expelled. Luckily, the school agreed to a parent-faculty conference before making it final and that meeting changed the course of my life.\n\nAs my parents sat there hearing how the school wanted to kick me out, I glanced over at my Dad and saw tears in his eyes. That image is still burned into my brain. My Dad sacrificed everything for his family, including his own education, and I was throwing it all away in the name of being my own man.\n\nI promised to never again be that selfish, short-sighted, and ungrateful.\n\nIt was too late for me to get into a good college, so I decided to attend a for-profit college that eventually shut down. With that diploma came an eclectic, but intentional career focused on up-leveling.\n\n## Early Career\n\nI started my career as an Assistant Store Manager at Walmart. I spent three months there but quickly realized retail management wasn't for me.\n\nI had been fascinated with Wall Street since high school when I participated in an after school program called Youth About Business. They hosted a Mergers & Acquisitions competition where the finalists traveled to NYC to visit banks and ring the closing bell on the New York Stock Exchange. I was a finalist and that visit opened my eyes to an entirely new world.\n\nI didn’t have the credentials to work in finance, but I was willing to play the long game and found a job at a Charles Schwab call center. It would pay $20,000 less than I was making at Walmart, and that was a lot of money to me. But I decided to take the pay cut since they sponsored employees for their Series 7 and 63 licenses, and that would be the start my career in finance.\n\nDespite passing my licensing exams, it was hard to convince firms to take a chance on me without a fancy degree or network.\n\nI made another bet and took a job with a temp agency in Chicago working in the back-office of Credit Suisse. It was a ten-week assignment and they needed someone with licenses to monitor trades and money movements. It wasn’t glorious work, but I was grateful to be doing it. Once the temp assignment was up, they decided to bring me on full-time and I was officially working in finance.\n\nMy job was in the Private Wealth division helping the MBA interns with admin work so that they could find their first clients. I would check Bloomberg for people who recently sold their business so that the MBA interns could call them to ask if they needed help managing their new riches.\n\nSoon after I caught a big break thanks to my soon-to-be mentor Jeff. Jeff was a Relationship Manager (RM) with an established book of business, and his small team of other RMs managed over $1 billion in client assets. I knew Jeff from casual interactions around the office, but seemingly out of nowhere, he asked me to be on his team so that I could work directly for him and his clients.\n\nAfter a while it became clear that Jeff was an ally, and I’m grateful for him and allies like him that help others up the ladder knowing that their small act of generosity can have an outsized impact. Working for Jeff gave me the confidence to know that I belonged in finance. Not just in a call center or back-office; but as a trader, portfolio advisor, and capital allocator. To this day, I go to Jeff for advice on major life decisions and try my best to elevate others the same way he elevated me.\n\n## Peace Corps\n\nAfter a few years working for Jeff and being around MBAs, business school creeped onto my radar. However, up until that point, I had only lived in the Midwest and needed to see more of the world. So I applied to the Peace Corps, and was assigned to Peru as a Community Economic Development volunteer, a life experience I could not pass up.\n\nFor two years I served as a volunteer in the mountains of Peru with no running water and limited internet. I washed my clothes by hand. I took bucket baths that were warmed by the sun. And I traveled down a treacherous mountain road whenever I needed to submit business school applications.\n\nDuring my service I taught youth entrepreneurship in the local high schools, hosted personal finance workshops for senior citizens, and launched a baseball academy for local boys & girls. It was a life-changing experience that taught me so much about the world and my place in it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3UPLtS4Mt5qk1HF_2V89m.JPG?height=3456&width=4608)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BDxDuMPd3WCSaaqL56Vxf.png?height=1286&width=1816)\n\nMy biggest takeaway was that despite my adversities, as an American, I was incredibly privileged by comparison.\n\nMy other takeaway was that despite being early in my career, I had knowledge and experiences that could positively impact the lives of many. I realized that even if you only learned a week’s worth of something, you can still teach it to someone who is just beginning.\n\n## Business School / Investment Banking\n\nAfter the Peace Corps, I began my MBA journey at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.\n\nI received a full-tuition scholarship thanks to Tuck donors and The Consortium. Without it, the $205,000 price tag would have been too much coming from the Peace Corps.\n\nI owe so much to organizations like The Consortium, Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT), Toigo, and to generous donors who want to see more underrepresented minorities succeed in business school and beyond.\n\nAfter business school, I went into investment banking and worked in New York as an Associate in the Global Industrials Group at Credit Suisse. I did that for a year, gained valuable modeling and valuation skills, developed an incredible network of highly motivated and brilliant individuals, but ultimately left because of the awful lifestyle.\n\n100 hour+ weeks consumed by stress and sleepless nights for work that gets trashed with little to no notice. I went into banking the healthiest I’ve ever been thanks to the flexible MBA student lifestyle, but emerged from banking one year later in the worst shape of my life.\n\nI left banking and began a self-discovery journey to find work that gave me balance and energy.\n\n## Tech / Drift\n\nAfter some reflection, I found myself gravitating towards entrepreneurship and tech. I was familiar with entrepreneurship, but not tech entrepreneurship. In the same vein, I was familiar with finance, but not Venture Capital.\n\nI remember having a hard time understanding what a seed round was. Or why capital raises were called Series A, B, C, etc. Or how a VC could have 9 out of 10 investments fail, yet be successful.\n\nI knew I wanted to be in the Tech ecosystem, but wasn’t sure if as an operator or investor. Ultimately, I thought startup experience would make me a better investor and founder, so I opted for the operator route.\n\nI wanted to work for a Black or Latinx founder since “you can’t be what you can’t see”, and was ecstatic to join Drift, a Latinx-founded B2B SaaS startup that recently became a unicorn.\n\nI got the job thanks to Twitter and a Spanish jingle I wrote for them.\n\n[https://twitter.com/OrlandoGomezzz/status/1337446027494891523?s=20&t=j2GXcWdIJeFEg9ZfIcX8WA](https://twitter.com/OrlandoGomezzz/status/1337446027494891523?s=20&t=j2GXcWdIJeFEg9ZfIcX8WA)\n\nThat jingle was my way of standing out as a candidate and highlighting my creativity. It was either going to peak their interest or get them to block me. Luckily, it was the former.\n\nAt Drift, I’m currently building out the Startups program so that early stage companies have the tools to accelerate revenue and have real conversations with their customers.\n\n## Harlem Capital / Web3 Familia\n\nOutside of Drift, I’ve been able to participate in amazing opportunities such as a VC internship with Harlem Capital. Thanks to them, I learned a ton about tech investing and was able to lean into my skills as a content creator (I also wrote them a jingle lol).\n\nDuring my internship, I saw that Web3 was going to be bigger than I ever imagined. Seeing the sheer number of Web3 deals in the pipeline, and the amount of capital flowing into the capable hands of builders convinced me to go all-in on Web3.\n\nPrior to that, I was a long-time skeptic of crypto. The banks I worked for assured me that crypto was not worth my time, and that it was primarily used to buy pizza and commit crimes.\n\nHowever, what I was seeing with my own eyes at Harlem Capital painted an entirely different picture. This new picture was filled with opportunity and ownership, and I wanted in.\n\nI had recently convinced my parents to invest in the stock market after ten years of struggling to get them comfortable with the idea, and I didn’t want it to be another ten years before they, and other Latinos like them, got comfortable with crypto.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zr4lnUpz9qk5mXxHBJ0nN.PNG?height=500&width=500)\n\nSo in November 2021, I launched Web3 Familia with the mission of onboarding 1 Million Latinos to Web3. It got instant traction and has become a community for Latinos to feel seen, heard, and empowered as Web3 learners and builders. We have since become an Education DAO on the NEAR Protocol and have raised seed capital thanks to NEAR’s DAOcubator program.\n\nWe are just getting started and I’m incredibly bullish on Latinos in Web3. This isn’t just finance or tech. This is the intersection of finance, tech, and culture; and Latinos have culture for days.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nLooking back, my journey has not been a common one, but one common fact has permeated it. The fact that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not.\n\nSo if you’re reading this as someone interested in Web3, Tech, VC, I-Banking, Business School, the Peace Corps, or any other field, just know that you belong in that space just as much as anyone else. You have the skills and talent necessary to achieve anything you set out to achieve. It might not appear that way at first, but don’t give up. Sometimes you have to be the change.\n\n[https://twitter.com/OrlandoGomezzz/status/1425502068027142148?s=20&t=j2GXcWdIJeFEg9ZfIcX8WA](https://twitter.com/OrlandoGomezzz/status/1425502068027142148?s=20&t=j2GXcWdIJeFEg9ZfIcX8WA)\n\n", "timestamp": 1658180281, "digest": "tsXqEIqWoykYnhjRE5cTXvPZQp1vr_etq-nGCwhGM5k", "contributor": "0xDd3C659B4aBB015f05527e8cC69a6424e5Fa1C09"}

Um deles destaca-se pela capacidade de entrega e inovação no desenvolvimento de ferramentas para a comunidade: **a Gnosis DAO**.\n\n## Desenvolvedores Geniais Criam Ferramentas Fundamentais\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SXJHYlidJqA2dzqoRERZz.png?height=700&width=1400)\n\nA Gnosis DAO é uma das organizações mais capitalizadas do cripto-setor: [em seu tesouro repousam U$1.2B](https://openorgs.info/). A riqueza financeira da DAO não é por acaso. Fundada em 2015 como parte de *software* desenvolvido pela Consensys, tornou-se uma empresa independente em 2017 e desenvolveu múltiplas soluções para a indústria cripto.\n\nVamos mostrar a você os principais produtos pela Gnosis e porquê são importantes para o cripto-mercado.\n\n## Tokens Condicionais\n\nOs tokens condicionais funcionam como mercados preditivos.\n\nUsuários competem entre si em apostas de acontecimentos futuros, como eleições presidenciais, quedas de regimes e jogos esportivos. A aplicação pode parecer simples, mas a Gnosis introduziu a monetização tokenizada neste produto, possibilitando investimentos em ativos inimagináveis - e tudo isso a necessidade de KYC ou moedas fiduciárias -.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/72g_oaa4e6vGZ4SXq6nDs.png?height=1998&width=1400)\n\nA Polymarket foi uma das primeiras plataformas a utilizou esta tecnologia como infraestrutura para construir sua própria solução de mercados preditivos, moldando-o ao seu produto e atraindo a atenção de usuários curiosos com a nova aplicação.\n\n## O início das *exchanges descentralizadas* e a proteção a MEV\n\nGradualmente, os desenvolvedores da Gnosis começaram a encontrar outras mazelas na indústria, destacando a ausência de liquidez em *exchanges* descentralizadas.\n\nDeFi estava apenas despertando e a Gnosis sabia da importância em construir infraestruturas para suportar o crescimento dos protocolos.\n\nA 1ª versão da DEX da organização, lançada em 2020, introduziu o conceito de *ring trades,* negociações compactadas em pequenos pacotes e enviadas coletivamente. Essa inovação permitiu aos usuários economizarem em taxas de transações e aumentarem a eficiência de seu capital, maximizando a liquidez para *trades.*\n\n![Exemplo de ring trade implementado na V1 da Gnosis e futura CoW Swap](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RUgcZzr8L3RdS2hW9nc-o.png?height=818&width=1063)\n\nCom o Verão DeFi despontando, aplicações como estas foram essenciais para a comunidade. Muitos de seus conceitos foram importados da CoW Swap, uma DEX desenvolvida por seus programadores em 2018.  O protocolo trouxe funcionalidades específicas, como a proteção a MEV - Miner Extractable Value -.\n\nEscrevemos um texto explicando cada conceito de seu funcionamento e [você pode ler ele aqui.](https://mirror.xyz/foxbrasil.eth/OCJPvUWxnrDg9pG1rQEQ_dC3YxLs69hNtQwLhtYIvs8)\n\nA evolução do ecossistema e a rápida adoção de seus produtos, fez a Gnosis inaugurar a V2 de seu protocolo e descentralizar a CoW Swap, tornando-a uma organização independente da empresa. Os *early adopters* receberam um *airdrop* com o token COW para votarem em propostas na governança e decidir seu futuro.\n\nEnquanto isso, mecanismos semelhantes aos da CoW Swap - proteção a MEV, melhoria na eficiência dos *ring trades* e até uma parceria com a Balancer - foram incluídos na 2ª versão do protocolo da Gnosis.\n\n## Custodiando Bilhões com Gnosis Safe\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3pX2A9aAsLhAsd8jgvhuC.png?height=645&width=1220)\n\nO produto de maior sucesso da Gnosis, sem dúvida alguma, é o [Gnosis Safe.](https://gnosis-safe.io/#getting-started) O protocolo desenvolvido para atuar como cofres para tesouros de DAOs teve larga adoção pela comunidade. A ferramenta para custódia de criptoativos tem [U$40B em seus contratos inteligentes](https://dune.com/safe/ethereum), distribuídos entre milhares de organizações descentralizadas.\n\n![O bull run de 2021 coincide com o crescimento exponencial do capital custodiado nos contratos da Gnosis Safe](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KMd_mzBJ2R1KfGfu8m3TR.png?height=403&width=902)\n\nSua ascensão não veio de repente: lançado em 2019 e em tempos de poucas DAOs, com o *bear market* assolando o mercado, a Gnosis criava uma solução para uma demanda latente atualmente, mas que, na época, ainda dava apenas sinais do que estava por vir.\n\nIntroduzindo as *multisigs* para contribuir com a segurança no armazenamento de criptos, a empresa possibilita a organizações ou grupos guardarem seu capital de maneira mais segura. Ao invés de somente 1 usuários ser capaz de mover os ativos, seus contratos demandam múltiplas assinaturas para conseguir transferi-los de um ponto a outro.\n\nMedidas como essa são fundamentais para manter tesouros de DAOs seguros.\n\nRecentemente, uma proposta na governança da Gnosis DAO - vamos chegar lá - aprovou a descentralização da Gnosis Safe, tornando-a uma organização independente regida por seu novo token de governança, o SAFE.\n\n## A descentralização da Gnosis e o despertar da DAO\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PmqI3MqPgHdVfsbo7fwOX.png?height=789&width=1400)\n\nComo mostramos para você, a Gnosis é um centro de desenvolvimento para novos produtos. Uma série de aplicações com ótima aceitação por organizações e usuários foram criadas por seus programadores. No entanto, ainda faltava a última peça: a total descentralização.\n\nEm novembro de 2020, a Gnosis anunciou sua conversão em uma Organização Autônoma Descentralizada. Seu token, o GNO, tornou-se um mecanismo para votações na recém-criada da DAO para votações em propostas de sua governança.\n\nEste passo final tomado pelos fundadores da Gnosis, foi uma migração natural para tornarem-se compatíveis com o *ethos* das Finanças Descentralizadas - passo semelhante dado pela ShapeShift DAO em 2021 -.\n\nTem dúvidas sobre as ferramentas da Gnosis DAO? Ou quanto sua utilidade?\n\nVenha para o nosso [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/shapeshift), [Telegram](https://t.me/shapeshiftdaoBR) e/ou [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShapeShiftDAOBR) e lhe ajudaremos com todas elas!\n\n***Autor: [guiriba](https://guilhermebarbosa.substack.com/), copywriter no LatAm Labs da ShapeShift, pesquisador e degen.

{"id": "71ADFTQVFsq3ktUDII3zXiJ6PuNEziPp7zXQALyNTLE", "title": "关于NFT提前从网站获取签名", "body": "这篇文章我觉得很有含金量，哈哈。\n\n最近打的NFT项目，有一些是需要从前端获取签名的。这个时候，市面上大部分的Mint工具都未必能过得了这一关。\n\n我在网上搜索了很多的资料，目前关于提前获取签名的教程几乎没有。科学家们的分享基本上都止步于合约mint、16进制mint等常规的mint方法，这些在我之前的文章里面也有提到。目前基本上来说超过半数的人都会这些mint方法，统称为非网页端mint方法吧。\n\n当一个NFT项目限制了必须要获取前端服务器签名才能mint的时候，大部分人就只能干瞪眼或者老老实实去前端mint了（当然前端大概率是抢不到的）。\n\n首先说下限制前端服务器签名才能mint的原理。这里以ApeDog为例。在合约的mint方法中，加了一个限制条件。\n\n```\nrequire(isAuthorized(sig,digest),\"CONTRACT_MINT_NOT_ALLOWED\");\n```\n\n就是说，每个钱包都需要提供一个签名才能调用mint的方法。这个签名需要从前端网页获取，是由项目方的钱包进行签署的。用户拿着签名去调用合约的mint方法时，合约就会根据签名反推出签名的内容，如果得到的内容（一般就是调用者的地址）是正确的，那么就允许用户进行mint。理论上，签名应该是对调用者的钱包进行签名，这样就不会出现所有人都共用一个签名的伪签名方式。之前有许多项目出现过类似的BUG，后来的人拿到前面人的签名就可以跳过前端直接合约mint。ApeDog这个项目，不光是对调用者的钱包进行了签名，还为每个签名给定了一个有效时间，过了这个有效时间签名就会作废。这个设置挡住了许多提前获取签名的人。\n\n那么前端是如何拿到签名的呢？我们在前端进行mint的时候，一般先连接小狐狸钱包，然后点击mint的按钮，就会跳出小狐狸窗口了，在小狐狸窗口中提交交易即可进行mint。其实在跳出小狐狸窗口的时候，我们看data里面的内容，就已经包含了我们所需要的签名信息了。这是最正规的获取签名的渠道。如果我们想要通过科学家的方式来获取签名的话，首先需要了解前端获取签名的过程。\n\n当我们点击mint按钮的时候，在前端网页就会触发一个event。这个event就会通过一个接口把我们的钱包地址等信息发给后台，后台在收到这些信息后，会调用项目方的钱包对这些信息进行签名，然后返回给前端。这个就是前端获取签名的基本流程。\n\n所以，如果我们不想老老实实的点击mint按钮去获得签名的话，就需要我们自己直接去调用这个接口来和后台进行互动。\n\n调用接口的方式很简单，一般就是两种方法，GET和POST。获取签名的话一般会用POST。调用POST方法的时候，需要输入两个参数，一个是目标url，一个是headers。url就是接口的地址，headers就是我们需要代入的参数。\n\n那么如何获得接口的url地址呢？两种方法，第一个，在前端页面的上通过f12打开开发者模式，在network选项卡中抓包。点击mint按钮后，找到网页对应发送的post请求，在请求中就可以得到我们需要的url了，顺便还能看到我们的headers中包含的参数，一举两得。这种方法的前提是网页要能打得开，一般情况下，比较火爆的项目在发售的时候，前端都会卡的根本没有机会点击mint按钮…\n\n第二种方法的门槛就比较高了，那就是阅读网页的源代码。大部分的NFT项目的源代码都会暴露在网页上，通过开发者模式就可以查看到。通过f12进入开发者模式下，就可以看到网页的js文件。这些js文件可能也是经过了处理，一般可读性都很差…还是以ApeDog项目为例，因为迄今为止我只从它这找到了接口地址。\n\n在apedog.wtf这个目录下只有一个js文件，所以找起来目标就比较明确了。有的项目目录下还有好多文件，找起来就不太好定位了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Pkw6CJycVHvOGjF57vISp.png?height=301&width=304)\n\n点击打开js文件，搜索POST，会出来许多匹配结果。一个一个看一下，看到这里，就需要注意下了。后面跟着一个sigurl。推测这个sigurl就是接口地址。接着搜索sigurl。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XS_BEndjvGRec_vPKxPYs.png?height=526&width=951)\n\n这下就看到了，后面的这个url应该就是我们要找的接口url了。接着看，下面一行还有一个auth，这个一般需要写在headers里面，类似一个授权的东西。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3eZG-wOhqyx_fA_pwEqpz.png?height=548&width=1034)\n\n接着搜索sigurl，看到这个部分。这里有两个参数，一个是sender，应该就是我们的钱包地址了，还有一个Authorization，就是需要我们刚才看到的auth的内容。那么，接下来我们就可以去调用POST方法了。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yVu7EqjX_bzOWAV0K5O4X.png?height=523&width=1100)\n\n这里用python的request库。\n\n```\nimport requests\n\nurl = 'https://1-0-0--wen-wl.rekttt.autocode.gg/'\nauth = 'tok_prod_DxcW8FCKenfdpGDbGD8puUfjqmEYCpPTZ5DijpGLd1XHpzaep19jxyds6y6HLMQ1'\nheaders = {\n  'user-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 6.0; Nexus 5 Build/MRA58N) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/103.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36',\n  'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + auth,\n  'sender': 'wallet address'\n}\n\nres = requests.post(url,headers)\nprint(res.text)\n```\n\n填入我们扒出来的url、auth还有我们自己的钱包地址。运行结果如下：\n\n```\n{\"signature\":\"0xf5d836dbeb2662e5066256456d8a2d05d6de926d28e4e70861cd90dbd755345710d83b290bce4dfd530042d2c32f8fc2d287a535fcf89187b008baf8e386e816\",\"expireTime\":1658179246}\n```\n\n看看这是啥，这就是我们需要得到的签名了。我们绕过了前端，直接通过接口的方式提前获取到了签名，拿着这个签名就可以去mint啦。这个方法需要我们能够从js文件中找到接口的地址，还需要弄清楚接口需要发送那些参数，比较考验我们的经验还有阅读代码的能力。不同的项目的代码都是不一样的，所以基本上每个项目都得重新修改获取签名的方式。对于普通玩家就非常不友好了。这里也非常佩服市面上的一些工具，能够自动获取签名，让用户赢在起跑线。不得不说，收费有收费的道理啊！", "timestamp": 1658182353, "digest": "gPVRK6cMCQJwJCLu0JPE6TpqmwSfXUoFiWrCLN_FSH8", "contributor": "0xA8D33Fa0687d50606b44A4744ad5E8Ff314a20e9"}

Check out our [Easy LP feature](https://support.perp.com/hc/en-us/articles/5257563598617) to make it a breeze!*\n\nDidn’t receive invites to any pool parties this summer? No worries, as we have kicked off our very own!\n\nAs a new initiative for liquidity providers (LPs), Pool Party offers incentives in both OP and PERP tokens for facilitating volume on our DEX.\n\nIn case you missed it, we detailed the plans for our allocation of Optimism’s governance token OP last month in a tweet thread:\n\n[https://twitter.com/perpprotocol/status/1532821939936436224](https://twitter.com/perpprotocol/status/1532821939936436224)\n\nTo improve market depth and incentivize liquidity provision, we’re distributing 8 million OP tokens to LPs. Read our full proposal [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/gf-phase-0-proposal-perpetual-protocol/201).\n\nAnd as part of this distribution, we’re getting the pool party started with a big cheers to every single LP that has ever supplied liquidity by rewarding them with a retroactive airdrop!\n\n## Retroactive OP Airdrop🪂\n\nIf you’ve ever provided liquidity to any of the markets on [Perp v2](https://app.perp.com/?utm_source=perp_mirror&utm_medium=blog_post), then you’re in for a surprise!\n\n*Check [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BUIh1Ba-oGX2lqnjab0FnJcuE8pY7qafPrHg3IcvlM8/edit?usp=sharing) to see if you’re eligible.*\n\nOut of the 8 million OP tokens allocated to our LPs, 1.8 million will be airdropped across all 689 historical LPs who have facilitated volume on our DEX since the launch of Perp v2 Curie. A total of 100,000 OP is to be allocated to each market.\n\nThe snapshot period covers the launch of Curie in November 2021, all the way until June 1, 2022. So if you’ve made markets before June 1, 2022, then you’re eligible to receive OP tokens!\n\nThe airdropped amount you’ll receive depends on how much volume your liquidity has facilitated for a market compared to the total. For example, if you facilitated 10% of the total volume for the ETH market between the launch of Curie until June 1, 2022, then you’ll receive 10,000 OP as an airdrop.\n\nIf you’re eligible, you’ll receive your **OP tokens directly to your Ethereum address on Monday, July 18th**!\n\n## Pool Party💧🥳\n\n5\\.2 million of the OP tokens dedicated to LPs will be distributed as incentives through our Pool Party initiative.\n\nMakers on Perp v2 currently receive 80% of the trading fees and weekly rewards of 5,000 PERP for each market. LPs can already enjoy hefty returns on Perp v2, with some markets offering triple-digit or even quadruple-digit APRs.\n\nBut since it’s OP summer, you can make hay while the sun shines with boosted rewards in the form of OP tokens!\n\nIf you want to accumulate some OP, all you have to do is:\n\n* **Pick a pool**,\n* **Provide liquidity**,\n* **Claim your OP tokens when the weekly rewards are distributed** (every Monday)!\n\n**LPs will need to** **claim their weekly OP rewards through the UI** when they are distributed on each Monday via the [Optimism](https://optimism.io/) network!\n\nThe number of OP tokens that makers can earn is based on how much volume you facilitate as compared to the size of the pool. For example, if you’ve supplied $100,000 worth of assets to a pool of size $1 million, then you’ll be able to claim 10% of the OP tokens allocated to that market from the weekly rewards.\n\nCheck out the following resources we’ve put together to help you get started as a maker and earn sweet yields:\n\n* [How to Provide Liquidity with Leverage on Perp v2](https://mirror.xyz/0x071B76df4a05Fb162569930aB82d8d265Bb8A497/85D6mYVpL2FkFpbJQx58dtVszO09citA4KOzFUFTSwY)\n* [What is Impermanent Loss?](https://blog.perp.fi/what-is-impermanent-loss-a9b1359d56f3?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------)\n* [How to Mitigate Impermanent Loss as a Maker on Perp v2](https://blog.perp.fi/how-to-mitigate-impermanent-loss-as-a-maker-on-perp-v2-dce3be4c3514)\n* [Earning Yield as a Maker with Easy LP](https://blog.perp.fi/earning-yield-as-a-maker-with-easy-lp-b72fa9f07730)\n* [Running Perp-maker for Fun & Profit (Part 1)](https://blog.perp.fi/running-perp-maker-for-profits-and-fun-part-1-a825ca1c9160?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------)\n* [Running Perp-maker for Fun & Profit (Part 2)](https://blog.perp.fi/running-perp-maker-for-profits-and-fun-part-2-673ef56da8da?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------)\n\nAnd on this note, we conclude our open invite to the Perpetual Protocol Pool Party.

USD\n\n研究种类：DAO, Governance, Tools\n\n原文作者:  Kenechukwu Eze\n\n创作者：Tian zhi xuan @DAOrayaki.org\n\n审核者：DAOctor@DAOrayaki.org\n\n原文: Decentralising leadership: from monolithic to modular and polycentric\n\n## 为什么要谈论领导力？\n\n如果你曾经担任过行政职务，成为有影响力的DAO成员，或者创立了一个新的组织，你可能会从内心深处体会到责任的重负。可能有非常多的工作，许多的不确定性，但却迫切需要做出重大、复杂，且往往会产生长期影响的决定。这是令人振奋的，但也是令人疲惫的，甚至是会使人变得神经质的。相反，处于无权无势的地位，即使不令人烦躁，也很快令人沮丧。而这当中的区别往往就被吹捧为：领导力。\n\n我们被告知，领导者会抱有一种心态和一套技能，如果我们掌握了这些，我们就能把事情做对。无数的研究人员沿着这条道路，汇编了各种理论和模型。与此同时，\"领导者 \"所面临的压力也在不断增加，要求他们掌握并表现出这些特质，也就是领导者应该是有远见的人、战略家、激励者、仆人、教练。。。这样的例子不胜枚举。\n\n有了所有关于领导力的工作，以及所有的这些期望，我们为什么要在这里谈论领导力呢？\n\n首先，通过Web3，我们可以从头开始思考这个话题和其他许多话题，从过去的经验中学习，但主要还是要建立在第一原则上，而不是陈旧的思维。其次，因为我担心我们在这里错过了一个诀窍，继续沿着这条道路走下去是有害的和不可持续的。\n\n下面的内容是试图为一场旧的辩论带来新的视角，也是受到 许多在这一领域已完成优秀项目并继续打拼的人 所启发的一个批判。\n\n## TL;DR\n\n下面，我将介绍另一个领导力模型，但这个想法并不是所谓的要 \"创造一个新的标准来取代以前所有的标准\"。相反，下面的模型说明了一个我认为更实用、更具破坏性的基本原则：我们可以从单一的领导力概念转向模块化的、多中心的领导力。\n\n从本质上讲，这里提出的模型摆脱了对领导力的单一概念，这种概念曾试图：\n\n* 对所有的领导行为、特质、角色等进行限定和量化，使之成为一个冗长的领导属性清单。\n* 并建议（通常是隐含的假设，但偶尔也会明确提出），我们需要 \"全能型 \"的领导者。\n\n相反的，这新的多中心、模块化的领导力模型表明：\n\n* 领导力有不同的领域和原型。\n* 每个人都可以掌握其中的一个或几个领域（但不可能在所有领域都很出色）。\n* 一个健康的组织依赖于合作，而合作的结果是在每个领域和原型中都有一定的能力。\n\n重要的是，模块化、多中心的领导力与 \"共享的、分布式的、集体的领导力\"\\[1\\]有不同之处，它基于三个原则：\n\n* 在谁担任领导的问题上有一定流动性是有利的，但完全依赖流动性很可能会导致 \"事情落败\"。\n* 我们可以把许多在 \"领导 \"下积累的基本职能，带回常规工作领域，从而减轻领导的负担。\n* 而且，领导和过程/角色几乎可以互换使用：同样的组织功能可以通过（是主要但并不完全是）：在需要时才出现的 \"领导 \"或通过先发制人的团体过程或角色来实现。\n\n好奇吗？那让我们再深入了解一下。\n\n## 我们如何达成？\n\n值得注意的是，大多数的领导力研究都是在大多数人被剥夺权力的环境下进行的：自上而下、命令与管控的组织，而其中大多数成员几乎没有所有权，只能在其特定角色的有限领域内提出变革。\n\n在这些环境中，员工跳出自己的角色，不顾一切地提出变革建议，动员他人，并且不承担负面的后果，这会是个例外而不是常规的。在传统的组织中，人们更期望老板能起到领导作用。\n\n有些老板是伟大的，有些则不那么伟大，在组织成功的地方，研究人员也跟着成功。\n\n首先，研究人员、顾问和从业人员都把注意力集中在领导者身上（组织中最明显的一部分），哈佛大学教授J.R哈克曼花了30多年时间研究团队，他称之为 \"领导归因错误\" ，也就是一种成功或失败被不成比例地归因于老板的现象。\n\n在某种程度上，研究人员还将组织与社会运动进行了比较。在社会运动中，有影响力的人物都从卑微的开始出现。而他们的结论是我们需要开始寻找两件事：\n\n* 非老板但有影响力的人物自身的品质使他们与其他人不同。\n* 使这些人物得以出现的是环境因素。\n\n大多数的领导力理论可以追溯到上述三种方法中的其中一种（研究指挥与管控组织中的老板，社会运动中知名人物的素质，以及使他们能够出现的环境因素）。\n\n随着研究的深入，关于如何成为一个好的老板，什么能使一个人成为有影响力的人物，以及如何为有影响力的人物的出现创造条件的研究结果不断积累。\n\n同时，随着创新成为组织成功的决定性因素，以及 \"人才争夺战 \"的加剧，组织成功的标准也随之提高，因此，对老板和经理的期望也随之提高。\n\n早期的期望包括提供方向，做出改变，并召集其他人参与到这个事业中来（注意与军事领导人或其他指挥与管控领导人的相似之处）。最近，团队的福祉被添加进来，刺激他们的思维并挑战他们超越自我，从各地带来信息和资源，明确责任，关注结果，承担风险，促进学习，创造心理安全，给予和接受反馈，这个清单还在继续。我们面临着领导力膨胀。\n\n隐藏在这些模式和期望中的观念是，这些任务、活动和结果不是常规工作。相反，它们是额外的一部分，是许多人试图描述和培养的一种几乎无形的、浪漫化的品质。\n\n同时，与自上而下、命令与管控的组织环境相比，我们看到了另类运动的发展：合作社、自我管理的组织、网络化的组织和DAO。\n\n这些组织的运作模式与传统的命令与管控相反。他们不依靠领导者来运作，而是旨在利用集体的力量：集体所有、集体责任和集体治理。\n\n虽然其他的这些环境已经存在了一段时间，但与传统组织相比，它们的数量相形见绌，而在学术界，主流研究的影响占主导地位。但也许，我们可能正在迈向一个转折点。也许我们在 \"领导力 \"下积累的所有品质已经多到一个人都无法掌握，而世界的步伐也快到任何一个老板或领导者都无法保持领先。我们的组织和领导范式已无法跟上脚步。\n\n它其实也不需要这样做。当一个结构变得单一，并在其自身的重负下崩溃时，那就是时候审查其目的，重构和模块化了。\n\n也许我们已经开始把太多的东西放在一个概念里，使基本功能成为例外，而不是规范。因此，让我们回到基本的问题上；我们实际上需要实现的是什么？我们能不能从选择组织的代理人的角度来构思这个问题，和哪个模式拥有 比命令与管控模式 来得更多的方式进行合作和分工？\n\n## 可行性的基本功能\n\n从基础的开始，我们可以说组织的存在是为了满足其利益相关者的需求。毕竟如果我们能够单独地满足自己的需求，我们就不会费尽心思来组织。而如果不能满足其他利益相关者的需求（或者不能成为他们的最佳选择），他们就会脱离，并去别的地方了。\n\n因此，当我们需要组织起来，这可能意味着一系列的事情；在这里，也有很多模式存在。我不会试图选择 \"一个单一的模型来解释这一切\"，但我会做一个有根据的猜测，选择一个被证明有用的模型。然后，我们将继续我们的练习，以表明这一调查路线可以通过这个新的模型引导我们对领导力有一个极其不同的概念。我希望，是一个更有用的模式。\n\n对于这个模型，我主要借鉴了比尔的可行系统模型的概念，它描述了使一个系统可行的5个基本功能（即一个能够适应不断变化甚至是敌对环境并蓬勃发展的系统）。我还加入了彼得-弗罗斯特和桑德拉-罗宾逊对 \"毒性处理者 \"的研究元素，以及对多种领导力理论的引用。最终，模型里各种泡沫可以被改变和重新洗牌。最重要的是多重的、不同的但相互依存的、平行的功能原则，因为这些功能对于一个团队保持执行力是至关重要的。\n\n六个为了可行性而做的关键互动（SKI）：\n\n以下是发生在人与人之间的六种基本功能，因此称为互动。这都是以它们所要解决的问题作为代表。\n\n* 身份：是什么让我们走到一起？我们的存在是为了服务谁，他们的需求是什么？\n* 未来：鉴于我们的环境演变，我们将如何发展以满足这些需求？\n* 变化：我们如何从这里走向我们想要达到的那个未来？我们如何改变和发展，并在各部分之间创造协同作用？\n* 协调：我们如何协调我们的工作？\n* 运营：我们每天都在做什么来为我们的利益相关者提供价值？\n* 支持\\*：我们如何使每个人都能持续地付出他们的努力？\n\n\\*熟悉VSM的朋友会注意到，支持可能属于比尔公司所谓的系统2。在SKI模型中，尽管（或特别是在）在一个有利于工人参与多个组织的环境中，\"支持 \"也会被赋予了自己的空间来推行自己（因为它在整个组织中被系统地忽略了），同时也强调了关心在嵌套系统的重要性。最终，这是一个针对特定环境的设计选择，所以请根据需要来自由调整。\n\n## 多中心、模块化领导\n\n当我们审视这些组织功能时，并远离工业时代组织的等级观念，我们可以设想一个有效并具有平行的功能的组织：每个功能对其生存至关重要，每个功能履行不同的作用。赋予这些功能活力，我们就拥有了一群人。而且是复数的。\n\n如果一个人必须监督所有的基本功能，他们很可能在压力下崩溃，又或者，正如最经常发生的那样，忘了一个或几个，直到有事情发生。许多组织都是这样走过来的，从危机到危机。依靠几个人表现出英雄般的领导力，并把全世界扛在肩上。其他组织试图走相反的极端方法，分散管理和责任，试图让每个人都能领导一切（许多DAO都在走这条路），但往往会遇到许多空档，许多人发现任务太过艰巨而不选择站出来，或者最糟糕的是，由于无结构的暴政，一个寡头统治了全部人。那么，如果我们以不同的方式切开属于我们的馅饼呢？\n\n在不同的时间和文化中，一个基本原则不断显现出来：不同的组织功能需要不同的个性来激活它们。例如，在祖先的部落中，我们发现萨满/长老和战士酋长。两者都拥有权力，都显示出领导力，但都是不同的类型。\n\n在中世纪的欧洲，我们区分了教皇和皇帝，主教和国王。最近，我们通过权力划分巩固了现代民主制度，而在Web2创业文化中，梦想团队的备忘录是由 \"一个黑客、一个潮人和一个骗子 \"组成的三人组。然而，在领导力的研究中，我们似乎已经失去了这种多中心主义，而倾向于一个单一的概念。\n\n因此，让我们来探讨一些替代方案。\n\n借用我们上面的SKI框架，6个功能中的每一个都有自己的气场，有自己的个性。对于一个强调组织基本功能的框架来说，这些功能也与领导力理论中的流行特征互相重叠了，但这并不奇怪（例如，促成变革、支持他人、创造意义等）。我们把它作为一种启发式的方法（\"所有的模型都是错的，有些是有用的\"），得出了以下的模型。6种领导原型\n\n* 哲学家/长者/源头 -> 身份\n* 有远见的人/鼓舞人心的领导者 -> 远见\n* 战略家/变革代理人 -> 变革\n* 协调员/统筹者 -> 协调\n* 工匠/技艺师 -> 运营\n* 照顾者/教练 -> 支持\n\n## 多中心、模块化领导的结果\n\n正如你在阅读清单时可能注意到的那样，某些人比其他人更有活力，更受某些原型的吸引，也更能体现某些原型。\n\n尽管我们所体现的原型是天性和教养的结果，但只要下足了努力，我们肯定能在每一种原型上有所提高。然而，如果我们试图在所有方面都发挥领导作用，我们就有可能使我们的注意力过于分散。\n\n同样，也存在一些两极分化。我们很难同时成为一个好的战略家和照顾者。或者一个哲学家和一个手工艺人。而从陈规定型来看，有远见的人是不善于协调的人。那些能够弥合这些两极分化的人确实存在，所以要注意不要把定型观念看得过于有用。\n\n好消息是，合作可以帮助我们专注于我们的优势而不是我们的弱点，在晚上睡得更好，更好地服务于他人。\n\n坏消息是，那些精通某一特定原型的人往往更重视它，也更可能重视体现同一原型的人。同样，社区和组织也倾向于围绕类似的原型形成。其结果是，某些原型在每个社区和组织中往往被系统地低估，而且往往是不自觉地低估。\n\n重要的是，我们需要注意到，原型往往违背了专业的分类，而且是视情况而定的。我见过的财务领导主要是护理人员。还有一些人力资源部门的领导，他们的主要原型是战略家，而最不突出的原型是照顾者。我也曾遇到过这样的情况：考虑到我的同事们的长处和短处，我更倾向于弥补和体现更多的原型，而不是我的默认合集。这种经历让我相当痛苦，最终导致我决定离开我共同创立的公司，并取消了我的股份。事后看来...\n\n教训是，在某些情况下，我们不太可能是适合这份工作的人。但是，我们不要看轻自己（或他人），而是可以尝试重新定位，寻找更方便的情况，或找到互补的人来支持我们。这就是从单一领导模式转向多元领导的模式，也就是多中心模式。\n\n\n---\n\n

At CryptoAnime, we believe that NFTs should derive their value from the story they tell. Our NFTs play an essential role in an ongoing narrative, providing creative *utility,* meaning and purpose designed to push the story forward while unlocking new sources of income for the collaborating artists.  Our motto is best described as *\"the story is the business model.\"*\n\n... and the storyline behind the NFTs is just as unorthodox as the business approach. **Hekonai** is a \"meta-narrative.” Its outer layer is designed to include everything you need in quality storytelling: distinctive characters, interesting events, relatable themes, a gamut of emotions, exotic settings, dramatic tension, plenty of excitement.\n\nBut that's not all it offers: on a second, deeper level, the unfolding plotline reflects the development of CryptoAnime itself in allegorical form. The idea is to offer entertainment that also weaves in commentary about NFTs, cryptofinance, Web3 and all the other brave new frontiers our company will explore.\n\nHekonai enters this storyline as a forgotten comic figure from the first anime. He becomes self-aware and takes control of his destiny as he travels into the metaverse to achieve his long-held dream of becoming a legendary samurai. His process of transformation drives a narrative that establishes meaning, purpose and utility for the NFTs that will explore the complexities of his new life as someone who can travel through several universes: animated, technological, even human life.\n\nThe story and digital assets will be complementary and interconnected in this meta-narrative format, each giving rise to the other as they interact with each other across multiple storylines and universes... including some generated by NFT holders. Sort of like the yin-yang symbol, with each side supporting and feeding into the other until they become indivisible.\n\n![Relationship between Story and Digital Assets](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/61JVPuoIQvANVPDffthUz.png?height=838&width=685)\n\nWe've got lots of surprises coming your way on both story and tech fronts. But first, we need to introduce you to Hekonai. He's written a journal for you that will draw you into his brave new world.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Hekonai's Journal - Season I** will present over 20 short story entries in the form of 200-word posts, often accompanied by original illustrations commissioned and created by anime/manga-inspired artists from every corner of our world, and links to other online media curated to enhance your aesthetic experience.\n\nYou'll be there at every step as he tells you the tale of his rebirth in his own words.

Uma das coisas mais importantes sobre esta nova tecnologia é que ela é descentralizada.\n\nUma Blockchain é mantida por uma rede de participantes (nós da rede) que chegam a um acordo sobre o status da rede (e transações realizadas) a partir de um mecanismo de consenso. Esse mecanismo diz respeito a como as redes estão seguras contra ataques e como os participantes chegaram a um acordo sobre um status para a rede.\n\nOs tipos mais comuns são a prova de trabalho (PoW, do inglês proof-of-work), usado pela rede Bitcoin e atualmente pela Ethereum (julho de 2022), e a prova de participação (PoS, do inglês proof-of-stake), usada, em geral, por plataformas de contratos inteligentes. Os tokens nestas redes são distribuídos aos participantes para que cumpram seu papel em assegurar a rede pelo mecanismo de consenso.\n\n![Fonte: https://cmte.ieee.org/futuredirections/2022/03/09/proof-of-stake-a-game-changer/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/em3zrricUcV52ZejXUzvT.jpg?height=1000&width=2000)\n\nEm tradução livre da imagem:\n\n**PoS (prova de participação)**, proprietários dos tokens da rede devem guardar uma quantidade mínima para se tornarem validadores. O contrato inteligente da Blockchain seleciona quem irá validar a transação, incluir um novo bloco na rede e receber a recompensa.\n\n**PoW (prova de trabalho)**, neste sistema apenas o primeiro validor que conseguir resolver a transação poderá incluir o novo bloco na rede e receber a recompensa por ele.\n\nEm relação ao custo de energia, enquanto PoW exige a utilização de hardwares especializados, com alta capacidade de processamento e gasto de energia, ainda há o fato da concorrência entre os validadores (mineradores), pois a cada transação apenas o primeiro a conseguir resolver é recompensado. Todos os demais que participaram gastaram tempo e processamento sem necessidade.\n\nJá no mecanismo PoS não há utilização de equipamentos e o consenso é administrado pelo contrato intelidente através dos validadores, que são os usuários que possuem uma determinada quantidade do token travado na rede.\n\nPor exemplo, no momento que publico esse artigo (julho de 2022) a rede Ethereum está em processo de migrar do mecanismo PoW para Pos. Para ser tornar um validador (nó da rede) do Etherium é preciso ter guardado na rede a quantidade mínima de 32 ETH, cerca de U$ 40 mil dólares (cotação de julho de 2022).\n\nDeixando a especulação financeira de lado, a tecnologia Blockchain é base das criptomoedas e da Web3, sendo um novo tipo de estrutura de dados de back-end.\n\nEssa nova arquitetura de dados teve origem em meados de 2009 (após a [crise finaceira do mercado imobiliário](https://www.politize.com.br/crise-financeira-de-2008/) americado de 2008), o que alegam ser uma das motivações de [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) – identidade utilizada pela pessoa (ou pessoas) que criaram o Bitcoin e a primeira Blockchain, com o objetivo de realizar transferências monetárias entre pessoas, sem intermediação de governos ou bancos, ou seja, um meio de pagamento digital e descentralizado.\n\nAtualmente há centenas de criptoativos (muitos com sua própria blockchain), contudo o Bitcoin ainda é o principal deste mercado e o único a manter sua finalidade de moeda digital (mesmo não sendo concretizada ainda).\n\nApesar de polêmico, o Bitcoin, a cada ano que passa, aumenta sua adesão por empresas, governos e até instituições financeiras, especialmente, como reserva de valor, amenizando a perda da inflação das moedas governamentais (como o nosso real), o que “rendeu” o apelido de ouro digital ao Bitcoin.\n\nDiferente do Bitcoin, algumas Blockchains são plataformas de contratos inteligentes. A pioneira nesse segmento e líder na quantidade de projetos desenvolvidos é a Ethereum.\n\nEnquanto o Bitcoin é comparado ao ouro, o Ethereum pode ser comparado ao ferro, pois é matéria-prima para a construção de algo novo. Há centenas de projetos desenvolvidos sobre a plataforma de contratato inteligente da Ethereum.\n\nEssas plataformas também são chamadas de \"redes de primeira camada\" e, além da Ethereum, outros projetos estão incluídos como Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Luna, Tezos e mais. Os aplicativos criados nessas redes são conhecidos como aplicativos descentralizados (dApps).\n\n**Outros dois movimentos aumentaram o interesse do mercado pelas criptomoedas: finanças descentralizadas (DeFi) e os tokens não fungíveis (NFTs).**\n\nAs DeFi são um conjunto de aplicativos que oferecem aos usuários um serviço de finanças descentralizadas, como empréstimo, crédito, derivados e outros a partir de criptomoedas baseadas em blockchain.\n\nConfira neste artigo mais detalhes sobre que são os NFTs.", "timestamp": 1658187475, "digest": "tGmC_8jpC6LihwoTn8EaoMi1mSWqowe-KpoeQ-IefMs", "contributor": "0x8A86d40E449Fecf1C0daF52CF73193D0eB05f703"}
{"id": "jWJpbXgUVWxdSdRY5zk2fZizzuAXc6ckUsIp1V-UDLw", "title": "平行链上线技术系列三 -Rococo local and public test network", "body": "## 引言\n\n本文首先介绍在Rococo本地的测试流程，最后介绍rococo 线上测试parachain的流程\n\n## Rococo local test network中测试parachain\n\n### Start Relaychain(Local Rococo relaychain)\n\n准备 rococo-local-cfde.json\n\n以下命令是在 polkadot 目录下操作的，这里切换分支到 v0.9.16,然后编译 cargo build --release\n\n编译完成后，在polkadot目录下执行：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C_0xRnm5IGE_P4MsMgOvu.png?height=181&width=837)\n\n### 启动parachain\n\n### 生成parachain的 chain spec\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2-Dju-evUp90RJWmuy56u.png?height=82&width=834)\n\n如果需要修改paraId,可以修改rococo-local-parachain-plain.json文件\n\n这里修改为: 2052\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-thk3hu4K0PrQ95D_1GKN.png?height=210&width=836)\n\n### 生成修改后的paraId的chainspec文件\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tkaCKwJhdN7E9MNZTyGoI.png?height=83&width=840)\n\n### 生成wasm文件\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CenBN-jai3EVSTOaDZJKf.png?height=81&width=834)\n\n### 生成genesis state文件\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vriEyaryQVmDJmORhbAXG.png?height=83&width=836)\n\n### 启动本地collator节点\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O_Godd8q2ej5lraF6UoKm.png?height=359&width=834)\n\n然后在打开本地的relaychain的polkadot-js的前端界面，注册parachain，上传Wasm和genesis state 参考：https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/cumulus/connect-parachain/\n\nRococo live test network中测试parachain\n比如，上面我们已经注册了parachain 2052,那么我们就可以在rococo公开测试网上测试我们的Parachain了。\n\n步骤:\n\n1、在 rococo public test network 注册一个paraId\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jfHWVEeK2sqCNdRIgt5pD.png?height=380&width=1080)\n\n2、通过这个ParaId（这里选择自己已经注册的一个Id，我这里选自己注册的2052）以及之前我们本地生成的genesis state和wasm文件来注册parathread\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9fMMrVTjnmngWmYE3pdJU.png?height=511&width=1080)\n\n3、当注册成为一个parathread后，我们可以看到parathread处于onboarding状态。此时，我们就可以申请成为平行链了，可以联系Parity官方的人进行操作，在element频道\n\n4、如果官方的人将Parathread升级为parachain后，我们就可以开始本地启动平行链进行测试，是否能链接到rococo live且正常出块。\n\n（1）首先，启动Live模式的parachain，这里有两种方式：\n\n第一种：修改parachain链的chainspec文件，以命令行的方式进行指定Live启动\n\n第二种：通过json文件的形式，由于我们之前已经在本地生成了rococo-local-parachain-2052-raw.json 这个文件，我们只需要修改其中的一些参数（目前很多项目方使用较为普遍的方式，而且操作简单）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FpJHjby12E72RERG8Eq9N.png?height=619&width=768)\n\n主要修改字段为：\n\nchainType：需要将Local修改为Live,\nrelay_chain：修改为rococo\npara_id：需要与我们在rococo live上注册的parachainId保持一致\n其他的字段看自己需要进行修改，也可不修改\n\n这里值得一提的就是bootNodes字段，这个字段在自己首次本地启动的时候无需进行配置，但是如果你的平行链已经上线并且需要给其他用户加入的话，这里就需要进行配置引导节点。\n\n（2）获取当前需要连接的rococo live的chain spec文件\n\n笔者此时的rococo live的runtime版本为polkadot-v0.9.16，所以我们从polkadot上获取到rococo的chain spec文件 ，放在我们的parachain目录下\n\n注意，我们的parachain live的runtime版本必须要和当前rococo live的版本一致\n\n（3）一切准备就绪后（准备好parachain live的chain spec文件和rococo live 的chain spec文件），我们就可以启动我们本地的平行链，准备连接到rococo live进行parachain出块测试了\n\n注意，下面的base path我们需要预留至少12G的空间(以当前时间为2022-02-20来计算的话)，否则空间不够拉取rococo的区块\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Fzb_bblMSkHgH9D7Trcog.png?height=379&width=832)\n\n在启动上述命令后，我们可以看到Log里会同步rococo的区块，整个过程大概耗时2小时左右，等待全部同步完毕后，我们的Parachain就会正常出块了～。\n\n查看rococo test network可以看到：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3rXCafMvytYfmqk2SBXwW.png?height=492&width=1000)\n\n打开本地8844端口可以看到parachain已经可以正常出块了，这里我已经出到204个块.....\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/erOdFD0dUJZ7GpzwFkE2Z.png?height=471&width=1000)\n\n至此，rococo live测试结束～\n\nRococo live 部署注意事项：\n\n1、如果出现以下问题:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/68yMT9DVa0n_doRpnraYb.png?height=80&width=832)\n\n这种是由于使用的rococo live的json文件和当前rococo live版本不一致导致的，比如使用的是polkadot-0.9.13的live文件，然而当前rococo live版本为polkadot-v0.9.16\n\n2、同步中继链区块错误：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2jUp9lxSYYeCD1CgPb5PR.png?height=330&width=836)\n\n这里是由于我们live Parachain的版本和rococ live不一致\n\n3、在将pallet版本从polkadot-v0.9.13升级到polkadot-v0.9.16时，出现一些pallet宏功能无法使用问题\n\n（1）pallet Struct的宏问题\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C5BXrt0I6p35uWuZc3Q3H.png?height=180&width=720)\n\n当前polkadot-v0.9.16版本中，Pallet结构体上需要加上#\\[pallet::without_storage_info\\]\n\n（2）pallet storage问题\n\n当前polkadot-v0.9.16版本中，我们在使用StorageMap这个存储结构的时候，如果我们的存储结构中涉及到AccountId需要使用OptionQuery的方式，而非之前的ValueQuery，因为在官方移除了对于AccountId的default处理，所以我们就需要使用Option的方式处理空值None。对应的咱们的pallet就需要进行重构，并对None进行处理，杜绝Runtime出现这种异常。\n\n4、在同步rococo live的区块时，出现以下错误，并且可以看到一直拉取不到最新的区块（本地同步的区块始终低于最新区块高度）\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CzgzyOEyt9CeCV4lsIYD6.png?height=153&width=835)\n\n这里是由于本地机器时间不同步，使用ntp同步即可\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y22_HmUImQ_W8mrXUgEpg.png?height=53&width=833)\n\n\n---\n\n通过

O contrato inteligente da Blockchain seleciona quem irá validar a transação, incluir um novo bloco na rede e receber a recompensa.\n\n**PoW (prova de trabalho)**, neste sistema apenas o primeiro validor que conseguir resolver a transação poderá incluir o novo bloco na rede e receber a recompensa por ele.\n\nEm relação ao custo de energia, enquanto PoW exige a utilização de hardwares especializados, com alta capacidade de processamento e gasto de energia, ainda há o fato da concorrência entre os validadores (mineradores), pois a cada transação apenas o primeiro a conseguir resolver é recompensado. Todos os demais que participaram gastaram tempo e processamento sem necessidade.\n\nJá no mecanismo PoS não há utilização de equipamentos e o consenso é administrado pelo contrato intelidente através dos validadores, que são os usuários que possuem uma determinada quantidade do token travado na rede.\n\nPor exemplo, no momento que publico esse artigo (julho de 2022) a rede Ethereum está em processo de migrar do mecanismo PoW para Pos. Para ser tornar um validador (nó da rede) do Etherium é preciso ter guardado na rede a quantidade mínima de 32 ETH, cerca de U$ 40 mil dólares (cotação de julho de 2022).\n\nDeixando a especulação financeira de lado, a tecnologia Blockchain é base das criptomoedas e da Web3, sendo um novo tipo de estrutura de dados de back-end.\n\nEssa nova arquitetura de dados teve origem em meados de 2009 (após a [crise finaceira do mercado imobiliário](https://www.politize.com.br/crise-financeira-de-2008/) americado de 2008), o que alegam ser uma das motivações de [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) – identidade utilizada pela pessoa (ou pessoas) que criaram o Bitcoin e a primeira Blockchain, com o objetivo de realizar transferências monetárias entre pessoas, sem intermediação de governos ou bancos, ou seja, um meio de pagamento digital e descentralizado.\n\nAtualmente há centenas de criptoativos (muitos com sua própria blockchain), contudo o Bitcoin ainda é o principal deste mercado e o único a manter sua finalidade de moeda digital (mesmo não sendo concretizada ainda).\n\nApesar de polêmico, o Bitcoin, a cada ano que passa, aumenta sua adesão por empresas, governos e até instituições financeiras, especialmente, como reserva de valor, amenizando a perda da inflação das moedas governamentais (como o nosso real), o que “rendeu” o apelido de ouro digital ao Bitcoin.\n\nDiferente do Bitcoin, algumas Blockchains são plataformas de contratos inteligentes. A pioneira nesse segmento e líder na quantidade de projetos desenvolvidos é a Ethereum.\n\nEnquanto o Bitcoin é comparado ao ouro, o Ethereum pode ser comparado ao ferro, pois é matéria-prima para a construção de algo novo. Há centenas de projetos desenvolvidos sobre a plataforma de contratato inteligente da Ethereum.\n\nEssas plataformas também são chamadas de \"redes de primeira camada\" e, além da Ethereum, outros projetos estão incluídos como Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Luna, Tezos e mais. Os aplicativos criados nessas redes são conhecidos como aplicativos descentralizados (dApps).\n\n**Outros dois movimentos aumentaram o interesse do mercado pelas criptomoedas: finanças descentralizadas (DeFi) e os tokens não fungíveis (NFTs).**\n\nAs DeFi são um conjunto de aplicativos que oferecem aos usuários um serviço de finanças descentralizadas, como empréstimo, crédito, derivados e outros a partir de criptomoedas baseadas em blockchain.\n\nConfira neste artigo mais detalhes sobre que são os NFTs.", "timestamp": 1658187488, "digest": "vui0LzOpC3Kst21sNatq5X4dXUKqn-pHl8oZzEaSfkM", "contributor": "0x8A86d40E449Fecf1C0daF52CF73193D0eB05f703"}

交易体 -（六）\n\n在Substrate中的交易不再称为Transaction，而是称为了Extrinsic，中文翻译就是“外部的；外表的；外源性”，意味着被称为Extrinsic的概念，对于区块链而言是外部的输入。这种定义脱离了本身“交易”的范畴（更像是转账的概念），而是在链的状态的角度下，认为交易及类似概念是一种改变状态的外部输入（意味着不止转账，只要是外部的操作都是，pallet func）。\n\n一个“外部输入”至少会具备以下两个条件：\n\n* 发送者的证明\n* 外部输入的行为\n\n其中第一点是显然的，只要基于公私钥体系，就一定需要发送者对这个发送的内容进行签名，在链上通过这个签名验证合法性，解析出发送者的公钥识别身份。等价于互联网中客户端持有的token这类的。而第二点就是这个“输入”是到链上干嘛的，其相当于是用户发送到链上的**指令行为**。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ttXXyTMN5D9PqUMHRVx72.png?height=394&width=840)\n\n关于链下如何构造这个signature，\n\n**插曲：链下一个交易体的构成：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-1lv6GhseuAYxFdPESwg6.png?height=120&width=841)\n\n**交易bytes内容的构造:**\n\npallet-func index + 发起人的Account（公钥）+ signature(signed, signature, extra) + call\n\npallet-func index是通过pallet name 和 function name在metadata里查询得到到index\n\n交易执行之后可以在此处\n\nexplorer下观察到signature的信息：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xikwq7JH0z1YOZ7Ufv7IS.png?height=295&width=1000)\n\ncall里的内容主要由call index和参数构造而成。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xFBlNceP9rQP-Yt5ASKjh.png?height=347&width=1080)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XlTz6CFShdfo-cUq1zxPk.png?height=447&width=844)\n\n至此我们获悉了交易体的byte信息\n\n所以对于上述的例子，相对应的字节费用为\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kNHJskfyzZUkH0wLcxIo7.png?height=80&width=840)\n\n其实在这里可以观察到由于交易体的设计，可以实现在发送之前就可以计算出交易的大小从而推导出交易的手续费。\n\n还有其他的玩法：\n\n* 交易版本与链上版本检查\n* 交易存活性检查\n* 特殊交易的额外信息检查\n* 例如如果一个交易是转账transfer，可以直接检查发送者的余额是否足够，不用到区块执行阶段才判定。\n\n### 权重费用(weight_fee)\n\n在有限的区块生成时间和链上状态的限制下，权重被用来定义交易产生的计算复杂度即所消耗的计算资源，以及占据的链上状态。system模块定义了区块的总权重（BlockWeights）。\n\n\\#\\[pallet::weight(200_000, xx, xx, xx)\\]\n\n为了保证在网络繁忙的情况下，依然能够实现对区块链应用有效合理的管理，Substrate引入了三种不同级别的交易类型，既 Normal、Operational 和 Mandatory 类型。\n\nNormal类型的交易是由网络中的普通用户提交，\n\nOperational类型的交易是由网络中的管理员或者管理委员会共同触发。\n\nMandatory类型的交易表示网络中区块交易所必须的交易信息，通常是内在的交易，由验证人触发。\n\n区块资源如长度和总权重按照一定比例在这三种类型的交易中进行分配，这一比例称为可用区块比（AvailableBlockRatio）。Kusama网络的设置为：\n\n10^12 weight = 1s\n\n1000weight = 1ns\n\n* 区块的总权重：2,000,000,000,000 weight(2秒)\n* 可用区块比：75%，即Normal交易最多只占用75%的区块资源，Operational类型的交易则可以占用100%的区块资源，新的交易如果导致对应资源使用率超过阈值后，会被拒绝。对于Mandatory类型的交易，即使在区块已经满了的情况下，依然可以把交易打包进区块内。\n\n**1、默认weight注释**\n\nSubstrate 中的所有可调度函数都必须指定权重。你可以使用注释的方式\n\n\\#\\[pallet::weight(xxx_xxx)\\] ，这个规范允许你组合包括 数据库读/写，权重的固定值 以及 基于banchmark的固定值。下面是一个基本的demo\n\nps: ExtrinsicBaseWeight 会自动添加到声明的权重中，以考虑将空的外部数据简单地包含到块中的成本。\n\n**对数据库访问进行参数化**\n\n为了使权重注释独立于部署的数据库后端，它们被定义为一个常量，然后在表示可调度执行的数据库访问时在‘注释’中使用：\n\n**2、自定义weight**\n\n可以创建自定义重量计算类型，而不是使用上述默认重量注释。此类型必须实现以下特征：\n\n* WeighData: 确定发货重量。\n* ClassifyDispatch：确定调度的类。\n* PaysFee：确定可调度的发件人是否支付费用。\n\n最后，weight fee的公式：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FJqMGt8hFNwG_o5lFkzYB.png?height=59&width=839)\n\n### 动态调节费率（targeted_fee_adjustment）\n\n设置  FeeMultiplierUpdate 参数即可\n\n细节深入—— Relay-chain transaction fees and per-block transaction limits\n\nToken Economics - Research at W3F\n\n区块链上的交易需求通常非常不规则。一方面，在一天内的小时或一个月内的天数范围内存在活动高峰。另一方面，有长期趋势的交易量增长趋势。我们需要一种机制，在考虑这些因素的情况下，随着时间的推移自动更新交易费用。\n\n根据供求规律，提高费用就可以减少需求，降低费用就可以促进需求。\n\n为了应对活动高峰，我们面临着在快速提高交易费用或可能有很长的交易包含时间之间进行权衡——两者都是不良影响。我们提出了两种机制。**第一种快速调节机制（Fast adjusting mechanism）**，可以非常迅速地调整价格，与活动的高峰和低谷同步。**第二种慢速调整机制（Slow adjusting mechanism）**，是以长期趋势的速度进行缓慢调整，并使用小费为用户提供在高峰时段控制等待时间的可能性。parity官方建议使用带有tips的慢速调整机制。\n\n关于动态调整机制的设置，也是在pallet_transaction_payment下进行配置。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z4xakw0WrpcypexK58xPe.png?height=296&width=836)\n\n### 小费（tip）\n\n小费不是必须的的，具体数量是由交易发送者决定的，并且完全由区块生产着获得；\n\n而交易费用的其他组成部分会根据一定的比例进行分配，国库80%，区块生产者20%。\n\n题外话：最后的手续费去哪里了\n\n至此关于交易手续费的内容，就全部介绍完毕，我们也进一步了理解了各个参数的含义，这个时候我们再回头看细化之后的公式，就能理解底层计算的计算逻辑了。\n\n关于手续费最终计算的代码：https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/polkadot-v0.9.18/frame/transaction-payment/src/lib.rs#L505-L537\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SuzABtDEHEB8_pOwvoSkj.png?height=237&width=845)\n\n## 关于 Benchmark\n\nSubstrate Benchmarking Documentation\n\nbenchmark主要是用于调整weight的内容，字节费用通过配置pallet_transaction_payment的runtime即可解决。\n\n在 Substrate 中，10^12 个weight单位 = 1 秒，或 1,000 个weight单位 = 1 纳秒。\n\n为什么需要使用benchmark\n\n拒绝服务 (DoS) 是分布式系统（包括区块链网络）的常见攻击媒介。这种攻击的一个简单示例是用户重复执行涉及密集计算的外部函数。为了防止用户向网络发送垃圾信息，我们向用户收取发送cal的费用。调用成本应反映系统产生的计算和存储成本，调用越复杂，费用越高。但是，我们仍然希望鼓励用户使用我们的区块链系统，所以我们也希望这个估算成本相对准确，这样我们就不会向用户收取不必要的费用。\n\n基准测试允许开发人员向最终用户收取适当的交易费用，以更准确地表示系统上的外部成本。设置合适的权重函数，准确反映底层计算和存储，也是 Substrate 中重要的安全保障。\n\n简单的理解：weight可以手动设置，但是每台机器的性能可能不一致，可以使用benchmark做一个测试然后测算出指定机器下 weight的大致范围。\n\n### 确定机器配置\n\n在进行benchmark之前，我们需要先确定机器的配置信息。\n\n### Benchmark的可用选项\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/US-4igPHvrjxFQihbswXr.png?height=831&width=562)\n\n### 进行Benchmark测试\n\n在pallet下创建benchmarking.rs文件\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lGsAuYoZRIe_QHvQ21YNJ.png?height=260&width=843)\n\n编写完benchmark之后 需要在生产机器下去进行benhmark测试。\n\n关于benchmark的一些配置项：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Mcycb1Kfo_DO3n1-ukXUS.png?height=302&width=839)\n\n你可以指定weight的模版生成定制之后的weight文件\n\n模版文件\n\n./.maintain/frame-weight-template.hbs内容：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mzbzNixaFYZ1E54Qfc3Vk.png?height=593&width=838)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J5rjX4JDp1ueUUwDp0Pje.png?height=840&width=506)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Yoftcu7j-Sho8moMYqPah.png?height=367&width=506)\n\n根据模版文件生成指定的weight文件\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ts_i-dBHymoJEOukmva3i.png?height=277&width=842)\n\n测试完成之后，关于weights的值也就估算成功了，在pallet里引入weight即可\n\n## Other link\n\n*https://github.com/paritytech/subport/issues/149*\n\n*中如何计算工龄在Substrate中如何计算交易权重姒煜的博客-CSDN博客*\n\n*Gavin：关于 Weight 你必须了解的要点哔哩哔哩bilibili*\n\n*Token Economics -
