{"id": "A-ClZi72gVAv4kYegsqelkX3bvHPFiBJVXNI8DnwBxs", "title": "The Data Availability problem: A Brief History and Bright Future", "body": "### The Data availability problem:\n\nIn the simplest of terms, Blockchains are a set of virtual computers agreeing on the same set of actions, and following the same rules. The set of rules they follow is commonly referred to as a consensus algorithm, with valid actions according to a virtual machine.\n\nInevitably, this leads to an unavoidable situation wherein Blockchains and the data they store are siloed from the outside world. Therefore, any interaction they have with an external data source introduces additional trust assumptions. The data that is available natively on-chain is held entirely by **full nodes** ‘running’ the blockchain. Where **archival nodes** are expected to store historical blockchain data and historical state changes, full nodes manage the *current state* of the blockchain. In addition, full nodes serve the chain data upon request to the agents that wish to interact with the blockchain.\n\nThis additional responsibility of full nodes is the central source of the “data availability” problem. In brief, when a new block is posted to the chain, how can full nodes be certain that the data is:\n\n**1) Complete (every transaction of the proposed block is available for download)   and;**          \n\n**2) Correct (the transactions are not fraudulent)**\n\nTherefore, the data availability problem introduces the key question; how can we be sure that the block proposer is not acting maliciously?\n\nCurrently, the only way to ensure that a *data withholding* attack is not occurring is to download the full block. It is, as Satoshi said in the Bitcoin white-paper, “the only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions.” **However, this creates a bottleneck for scalability as nodes can’t verify larger blocks without significantly increasing the hardware requirements.** Higher TPS requires larger blocks since each transaction consumes data and processing power (to validate/execute). Thus, a solution that allows for larger blocks without increasing hardware requirements is imperative for scalability.\n\nTo date, increasing block sizes has been considered the only viable solution for increasing throughput, but the purpose of this article is to outline the evolution of blockchain architectures that have unlocked new answers to the data availability problem without sacrificing decentralisation or user-sovereignty.\n\n### Four key blockchain components\n\nTo understand this further and tackle this question holistically, we must first understand the four core functions of a blockchain - Execution, Settlement, Consensus, and Data availability.\n\n* *Execution* is the layer where applications live and state is updated.\n* *Settlement* is where execution layers verify proofs, resolve disputes, and transfer assets between execution layers.\n* *Consensus* is where nodes agree on the order of transactions included in a block\n* *Data availability* is making sure that the transaction data is available to users and block producers (consensus nodes).\n\n### Monolithic vs. Modular architecture blockchains\n\n![A visual representation of Monolithic vs. Modular blockchain architecture](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vsmkZ5M8_yw3VWcZcY3bu.png?height=6251&width=12501)\n\nTraditionally, blockchain architecture has relied upon these four concepts to coalesce on the same layer which has been termed a *monolithic architecture*. This architecture will always have the least amount of trust assumptions, a positive outcome for users wanting to transact securely. However, there are tremendous limitations on scalability, hardware requirements, and transaction efficiency. This is because the blockchain is responsible for the four components and can’t make software optimisations to increase functionality. This is where a new paradigm has been introduced: *modular architecture*.\n\nIn contrast to monolithic architecture, modular architecture separates those four core concepts of Execution, Settlement, Consensus, and Data Availability, and in so doing allows for greater scalability of the blockchain’s capabilities. In separating the four layers, it allows them to be specialised for intended purposes, which increases efficiency whilst still having minimal trust assumptions.\n\nThe narrative and wide-ranging support for modular architectures has developed traction over the first half of 2022. While Rollups, both Optimistic (Arbitrum, Optimism and Metis) and Zero-Knowledge (Starkware, Loopring, AZTEC and zkSync) are in fact modular execution environments, they have mostly not been marketed as such. The recent uptick in support has largely been catalysed by Celestia, which this article will explore in detail. However, it’s important to note that the modular architecture narrative has long been foundational to the data availability discourse.\n\n### A brief history:\n\nBitcoin was the first blockchain, and thus, the first to encounter the data availability problem. Mastercoin, a Bitcoin sidechain that ICO’d in 2013 attempted to use Bitcoin as a data availability layer (DAL) and consensus layer (CL). Rather than needing to bootstrap its own secure consensus by Proof of Work (Proof of Stake was not yet developed), Mastercoin utilized Bitcoin’s already extensive support network of users and their full nodes. Hailed as the Meta-Protocol, by bringing features such as token swaps and betting markets to Bitcoin, Mastercoin hoped to provide the first proof of concept to expand upon Bitcoin’s capabilities. At the technical level this was achieved by allowing transactions to be executed on the Mastercoin sidechain, flagged, and then sent back to Bitcoin, which was used as a Data availability layer (DAL). This is the first example of a sidechain/L2 with a modular philosophy, with extensible features that doesn't require L1 governance/hard forks. Mastercoin was dubbed the original Altcoin, but ultimately it failed.\n\nThe reason for Mastercoin’s failure remains an ongoing debate. One often cited reason is the protocol architecture failures, such as low liquidity for tokens issued via the platform due to the absence of AMMs. Hostility from Bitcoin core developers, leading to a price increase in data blobs is also often cited as a contributor to Mastercoin’s downfall.\n\nOne thing that is clear, however, is that Mastercoin was difficult to run a light-client on. It required users to run full nodes of both Mastercoin and Bitcoin in order to verify the integrity of Mastercoin blocks, and thus the validity of Mastercoin transactions. This immediately isolated Mastercoin users from the established ecosystem of lightclients and wallets that Bitcoin had developed at that stage.\n\nEthereum was born out of the idea of a world computer, evolving the initial idea of Bitcoin by allowing decentralized applications to be built on top through being Turing complete. The four core functions were coupled (monolithic architecture), and inextricably linked to ensure maximum security for users. The downside, however, is that this was paramount to the enormous spike in Ethereum gas fees as user adoption increased. Rollups offered a paradigm shift as they welcomed modular execution layers, and radically reduced gas fees for their users (though they won't over the long-term without further innovation). Ethereum’s long term roadmap prepares to implement data-shards to reduce gas fees and maintain its superlative security characteristics. The optimal end state of these shards remains debated by the Ethereum community, but there is general agreement on what the first step will look like.\n\n### A brief look at the future of Blockchain architecture:\n\n***Proto-danksharding***\n\nThe first step to facilitating data shards will most likely be through EIP-4844 proto-danksharding, which was introduced by Ethereum foundation researcher Dankrad Feist. In proto-danksharding, the spec is to implement most of the logic (transaction formats, verification rules) that make up the full spec, however, it will not allow for *actual* sharding. The main feature being introduced will be *blob-carrying transactions*. Blobs are extremely large (125kB) and can be much cheaper than Calldata (the benefits of this compared to just making calldata cheaper is with regards to average load and worst case load).\n\nIf you’re interested in the development and nature of sharding on Ethereum, [read this](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/proto_danksharding_faq): \n\n[https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844)\n\n### A new future for Modular blockchains?\n\nThus far, this article has focused on more traditional blockchain systems in order to provide adequate context for the variable architectural frameworks currently in use. However, it is worth noting that much of the recent conversation around modularity and data availability has been credited to the following that [Celestia](https://celestia.org/) has attracted over the course of 2022.\n\nCelestia is a modular blockchain that provides data availability and consensus. By only being responsible for these two functions, Celestia can make specifications that optimize for these environments. This leads to creating a more scalable DAL and CL. Essentially, Celestia is responsible for two things, making sure the data is available and that it is in the correct order. \n\nCelestia enables data availability via its novel proofs known as data availability proofs (DAP). These proofs use erasure codes, which is a method of data protection that ensures that if you lose a piece of data, that you will be able to recover it. The proofs require each light-node to sample a very small number of random chunks from each block in the chain, and only work if there are enough clients in the network to ensure the entire block is sampled. This means the more clients you have, the greater the possible block size you can have in a secured system. In addition, the elegance of this is that it is also incredibly easy to operate a light-client in Celestia. So easy, in fact, that you could run one on your phone, making Celestia incredibly hardware friendly. Vastly lowering the barrier to entry for running a light-client, Celestia becomes hyper-scalable, as scalability = TPS / cost to check the block, not just TPS.  \n\nSo Celestia is a layer for data availability and consensus, so what about the other components of the blockchain? For the most part, three different types of rollups will plug-in to Celestia. The first being Celestiums, which are Ethereum rollups that use Celestia for DA.  Celestiums can handle  higher transaction throughput, but it’s worth noting that doing so will make slight to moderate security trade-offs. A sovereign rollup is the second kind, this is mostly just a rollup that we see on Ethereum, however, the sovereign rollup does not need to gain permission to fork and push upgrades. The last type is a settlement rollup, which is an environment that is highly optimised for execution layers to post their transaction prior to the transaction settling and being sent down to Celestia.\n\nTo learn more about Celestia, start here: <https://celestia.org/learn/>\n\n### Conclusion\n\nData availability has long been an issue limiting the scalability of blockchains to date. Via breaking down the traditional blockchain stack, and becoming more modular, DALs are able to optimise their function such that it can provide maximal security without introducing additional trust assumptions. The future is bright for both Ethereum and Celestia, who among many others are introducing new mechanisms to solve for data availability whilst still ensuring users maintain security, sovereignty, and inexpensive transaction costs. Modular blockchains an innovative frontier for the industry, and we look forward to supporting those ecosystems as they continue to grow.

Summoners \n Summoners团队成员是运营代表，负责围绕Mages的批准、指导和法律监督、财务、为协调相关任务提供服务。 运营代表不一定是成员。Summoners的任务包括但不限于： \n l 协调 \n ü 确保所有其他 DAO 成员了解提案 \n ü 确保参与标准得到执行 \n ü 发起或鼓励对低于最低参与度的成员提出的愤怒的提议 \n ü 管理通知机制，确保 DAO 成员及时收到未决提案投票的通知以便参与 \n l 代表DAO签订经批准的法律合同 \n l 对DAO的链下资金/资产采取批准的行为 \n l 招聘外部会计师、律师等服务提供者。 \n l 协调DAO的公共关系 \n l 采取注册DAO的链下财产行动（如果有） \n **讨论社区:** \n https://discord.com/invite/c4HqXp9JnV\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yI0a45YBgDW45vDfgos8S.png?height=283&width=796)\n\n**资助计划 \n 资助计划详情**： \n 在过去的两年中，他们也一直在努力搭建桥梁并培养高度一致的项目和团队社区——构成了 MetaCartel 的周边社区。 \n 资助计划:https://www.metacartel.org/grants \n 资助申请表： \n https://forum.metacartel.org/t/guide-how-to-post-a-funding-proposal/74 \n 资助情况: \n I轮:https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-dao-wave-1-funding-9e2beb1fcd8e \n II轮:https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-dao-funding-wave-ii-c626d49830aa \n I & II轮: \n https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-dao-wave-i-ii-progress-and-outcomes-cohort-0-c0360a5da072 \n III轮:https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-cohort-1-6336cdca05db \n 资助项目:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XPPyaVWzcnvICOpTaDfoC.png?height=601&width=432)\n\n# 链上治理\n\n**链上治理详细机制：** \n Moloch DAO v2 智能合约标准具有以下几个特点，非常适合促进 MCV 的社区治理目标： \n 1、会员权限： \n l 允许入会： \n MCV 的会员资格是一个经过许可的过程，反映了 MCV 现有会员资格的智慧。在链上提交新成员提案并进行投票之前，候选人必须首先得到 MCV 现有成员的支持，并接受内部成员驱动的评估，其中考虑其成员资格的各个方面：文化契合度、专业知识、法律可行性等。 \n l 许可续会资格和社区监管： \n 一个人要继续成为 MCV 的成员，该人必须默示获得 MCV 成员的多数同意。任何成员都可以随时提议将另一名成员从 DAO 中除名，如果该提议得到足够多的成员的批准，该人将失去其 MCV 份额和治理权，同时收到支付代币和索赔代币，代表成员根据Grimoire有权获得的 MCV 财产的百分比。 \n 2、会员退/减免权限： \n Moloch DAO v2 智能合约体现了“选择加入”和自主选择的密码朋克设计原则，因此退出 DAO 变得尽可能容易、去信任和经济上无风险。因此，MCV 的成员可以在任何时间对成员的全部或任何部分股份进行RageQuit，并接收根据Grimoire成员有权获得的 MCV 财产百分比的付款代币和索赔代币。 \n 链上治理范围和关键参与者 \n 1、会员权益概述 \n Mages和 Goblins都能够通过MCV 的 Moloch.sol 智能合约进行链上功能交互，无需许可地执行以下所有操作： \n l 提交DAO提案； \n l 对DAO提案进行投票； \n l RageQuit 并获得他们在每个 DAO 资产中的百分比权益 \n 2、投票标准 \n 提案有两种类型：普通和特殊。 \n l 普通： \n 普通提案包括入会、开除会员、向服务提供者支付费用以及对其他项目的拟议投资。普通提案完全通过 MCV的 Moloch.sol 智能合约在链上处理。 他们必须由现有成员赞助，但可以由任何人提议。提案的结果由计票的多数决定，没有法定人数要求。 \n l 特殊提案： \n 与 MCV 的元规则相关的提案，不能完全在链上处理。如果此类提案未经必要的法律手续而在链上提出并获得批准，则该提案将无效且不予兑现，并应开除负责成员。非常规提案需要获得 MCV 当时 69% 的现有股份的批准。特殊提议的示例包括在任何重大方面修改Grimoire的提议（指定的例外除外）、将 MCV 超过 50% 的投资资产出售给第三方、将 MCV 作为有限责任公司与另一个商业实体合并或收购另一个商业实体或其他组织的大部分资产或证券，或开始参与任何法律程序。 \n **提案提交概述** \n 在 Moloch v2 智能合约中，有 8 种提案类型必须通过投票和宽限期，类似于 Moloch v1，包括： \n l 入会建议 \n ü DAO 会员申请者的贡献资金托管在 Moloch.sol 智能合约中，因为他们的会员提案需要通过投票和宽限期。 \n ü 当 DAO 提案通过时，DAO 会员贡献资金从 Moloch.sol 转移到 GuildBank，在那里不可转让的会员权益将被铸造并分配给新批准的DAO 成员。 \n ü “会员”提案还可以提供加密代币（而不是股票）作为付款。从法律上讲，这些不是会员提案，而只是从 DAO 接收某些财产或服务付款的机制。 \n l 会员开除（GuildKick）提案 \n ü 可能性#1：如果该成员之前没有对任何未决的提案投过“是”（例如，正在投票或已经批准但在宽限期内），那么目标成员将立即被退出，效果如同目标成员自愿退出（例如，成员按比例收到所有 RageTokens 和 RageClaims）。 \n ü 可能性#2：如果成员对任何仍在等待中的提案投了“是”（例如，正在投票或已经批准但在宽限期内），则该成员不能立即被强制退出（出于同样的原因）我们不允许会员在相同情况下自愿退出），因此，会员被“监禁”。 \n l Jailing & Ragekick \n ü 在被监禁成员投“是”的提案被处理之前，他们被监禁并且不能对任何其他提案进行投票。从本质上讲，GuildKicked成员不再是正式成员，而是在实际收到分配之前，在一段时间内对相关的 RageToken 和 RageClaims 持有纯粹的经济主张的人。 \n ü 一旦所有相关的待处理提案都处理完毕，任何成员都可以对目标成员调用“RageKick”函数，或者被监禁的成员可以对自己调用“RageQuit”函数。任一操作都将触发向目标成员适当分配 RageTokens 和 RageClaims。 \n ü 在目标成员因接收特定 RageToken 而被列入黑名单（如上面“RageQuits”下探讨的假设）并且没有足够快地“safeRageQuit”（2 周内）的情况下，目标成员将要求 “救助”。 \n l 救助 \n ü 在公会被踢的成员监禁时间过长（超过两周），他们的“是”批准的提案已经处理，并且没有 SafeRageQuitted，则他们可能会被保释。这意味着他们的资金被“救助”到由一组受信任的成员和/或summoners控制的多重智能合约，他们在法律程序中的行为很像接收者或受托人。 Grimoire将要求这个受信任的小组努力将RageTokens 和 RageClaims 分发给退出成员。 \n l 代币白名单提案 \n l 投资建议 \n l OTC/贸易提案 \n l Rant proposals\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a9zk_i_9SRhztMqCEUnrm.png?height=418&width=747)\n\n# 技术\n\n技术和网络概述： \n Moloch DAO v2 智能合约依赖于由第三方控制的外部 ERC-20 智能合约，MCV 的意图是让 DAO 主要通过其链上智能合约管理其资产以限制管理开销，这是该协议的主要关键技术组件 DAO 是： \n l GuildBank: \n DAO 智能合约 (GuildBank.sol) 管理 DAO 的代币。这些资金用于 DAO 对其他项目的投资、向 DAO 的服务提供商付款，或用于向 RageQuit 或被开除的成员赎回会员资格。 \n l Claims 代币: \n 索赔代币合约 (ERC-1843) 是智能合约，通过特定的 ERC-20 代币分配对未来收入的索赔。索赔代币合约的实例允许 DAO 代表创收资产或非加密资产，例如尚未上线的 SAFT，以及传统公司的股权。 \n l 链下： \n 用于向服务提供商付款的链下资产保存在 LLC 的银行账户中，其公司所有权通过法律合同获得担保。 \n 主要 GitHub 存储库 \n 地址：https://github.com/metacartel \n 智能合约 \n Moloch DAO v2 智能合约\n\n# 媒体链接\n\nOfficial website:https://www.metacartel.org/ \n Medium:https://medium.com/metacartel \n Twitter:https://twitter.com/meta_cartel\n\n\n---\n\n通过 DAO，研究组织和媒体可以打破地域的限制，以社区的方式资助和生产内容。DAOrayaki将会通过DAO的形式，构建一个代表社区意志并由社区控制的功能齐全的去中心化媒体。欢迎通过文末方式提交与DAO、量子计算、星际移民、DA相关的内容，瓜分10000USDC赏金池！欢迎加入DAOrayaki社区，了解去中心化自治组织（DAO），探讨最新话题！\n\n官方网站：<https://daorayaki.org>\n\nMedia：<https://media.daorayaki.org>\n\nDiscord server: <https://discord.gg/wNUPmsGsa4>\n\nMedium: <https://medium.com/@daorayaki>\n\nEmail: [daorayaki@dorafactory.org](mailto:daorayaki@dorafactory.org)\n\nTwitter: @daorayaki_\n\n微信助手：DAOrayaki-Media \n ", "timestamp": 1653367746, "digest": "LDFyUME4lNZTAjcK4cZu4nH-9vLcaY6ljJrE00b2lpc", "contributor": "0xF22b4cE3b2d153290Be6E97CB514dEff04799AfB"}

BitDAO简介\n\nBitDAO是世界上最大的DAO之一，由Peter Thiel, Founders Fund, Pantera, Dragonfly等支持。Bybit已承诺向BitDAO金库提供经常性捐款，以2021年的利率计算，每年超过10亿美元，其愿景是通过DeFI技术实现开放金融和去中心化的代币化经济。因此，BitDAO依托于DeFi的成功，并将分配大量的财务和人才资源来支持DeFi的发展。\n\n# 背景\n\nDeFi技术允许在区块链上进行不可阻挡且无许可的金融交易，包括交易、借贷和合成资产的创建。由于没有注册流程，没有中间商批准，没有中间商执行，DeFi将从根本上颠覆传统金融，并可能成为一个万亿美元的行业。代币化扩大了产权范围，为DAO、可收藏NFT和游戏提供了新的经济模式。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-p30HAhMH0fbLOtGsTu-U.png?height=422&width=936)\n\nBitDAO将自己定位为世界上最大的DAO之一，其愿景是开放金融和去中心化的代币化经济。它是一个贡献者的集合。随着时间的推移，社区领袖会出现。BitDAO的愿景和使命将由代币持有人、贡献者和社区领袖来推动。\n\n简单来说，DAO通过区块链和智能合约发起提案，协调成员行动和资源。成员可以通过投票对提案进行表决。他们持有的代币越多，投票权就越大。如今，DAO（Decentralized Autonomous Organization）也成为许多DeFi项目的重要方向，如Maker。\n\n“BitDAO是一个由BIT代币持有人控制的DAO。它不是一个公司，没有治理团队或员工。任何个人、开发团队或研发实验室都可以为BitDAO提出升级、代币交易和合作建议，BIT代币持有人将投票决定是否批准或拒绝这些建议。” BitDAO官方表示，并希望通过DAO的使用支持DeFi行业的发展，具体从三个方向努力。\n\n● 研发 – BitDAO合作伙伴将建立研发中心，开发BitDAO核心协议（治理和基金管理），开发BitDAO DeFi产品，支持DeFi合作伙伴，并为新兴DeFi项目提供孵化服务。 \n ● 流动性 – BitDAO将控制最大的资产池之一，可用于为合作伙伴协议提供流动性。BitDAO可以指导新的协议，如DEX、借贷和合成。 \n ● 资金 – BitDAO将通过拨款（如通过Gitcoin）支持区块链技术，并通过代币交易支持DeFi项目。\n\nBitDAO的普及与它背后的主要衍生品交易所Bybit的贡献是分不开的。根据公告，Bybit承诺将其未来合约交易量的0.025%作为收入贡献给BitDAo金库，并定期进行捐赠。BitDAo官方给出的估计是，年收入将超过10亿美元。经查询发现，Bybit确实按照承诺每天定期向BitDAo捐款，日均捐款金额接近400万美元，如下图所示：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QI9tn-plcf8t0zCUGu8Cf.png?height=678&width=936)\n\n平均每天的捐款为400万美元，约占收入的一半。Bybit资助BitDAo显然有自己的考虑。此前，英国金融监管局和加拿大安大略省证券委员会都禁止Bybit向其公民提供服务，ByBit随后停止了在该地区的服务。随着全球监管趋严，加密货币衍生品交易平台面临转型：一是走合规之路，迎合监管；二是通过DAO走去中心化之路。Binance选择了前者，Bybit选择了后者。从这个角度看，BIT也可以看作是Bybit的 “平台货币”。\n\n# Bybit对BitDAO的影响\n\nBitDAO的价值主要来自于Bybit的赋能，所以我们先来看看Bybit的现状。众所周知，Bybit是衍生品赛道上的一颗新星，仅次于三大交易所，并不时超越第二和第三。Bybit自身的现货功能很弱。虽然Huobi团队目前正在加紧开发，但要赶上其他交易所还有很长的路要走。BIT的现货交易也需要依赖其他交易所。另一方面，Bybit目前规模庞大，受到各国监管机构的严格关注。因此，它特别重视合规性。再加上对 \"DAO \"透明度的要求，支出需要披露。很明显，不可能看到。\n\n# 增长\n\nBitDAO希望通过代币交换和共同开发工作与项目合作，以增加社区的增长。 \n ● 交换 – BitDAO的目标是进行代币交换，并积累顶级的现有和新兴的DeFi和加密货币项目的集合。交换将使他们的利益保持一致。BitDAO将被激励支持这些伙伴项目成为类别领导者。一个优先事项是现货和衍生品DEXes。 \n ● 建设 – BitDAO旨在建设核心产品，使BitDAO或其他DAO更有效地运作，这些产品包括。 \n ● 治理套件 - 一套链上和链下产品和最佳实践。 \n ● 财务管理 – DAO能够部署和监控资产以赚取收益或启动产品。 \n ● 赠款 – BitDAO旨在为生产研究或产品的团队提供赠款，这些产品是加密货币行业的公共物品。一种可能性是匹配Gitcoin赠款。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tzTmGpevpZzJ7Uy7hbXnG.png?height=494&width=936)\n\n利益来自于合作伙伴和整个行业的成功。凭借数十亿的资产和经常性的贡献，BitDAO将继续创建伙伴关系，积累最好的DeFi资产，并建立有用的产品。然后，合作伙伴和产品将为BitDAO的金库作出贡献，创造一个复合和积累的动态。\n\n# 代币分配\n\n● 30%的BitDAO资产将由金库持有，以促进生态系统互换。 \n ● 5%将作为奖励提供给项目开始时的初始合作伙伴。 \n ● 60%的Bybit将分配给Bybit建立研发中心，以支持BitDAO，支持Bybit的发展，而这又可以帮助BitDAO基金库的发展。其中，15%的代币供应可以立即使用，其余45%的代币供应可以立即使用。供应将被锁定1年，锁定期结束后将在2年内逐步释放。\n\n# 代币锁定和释放\n\n根据BIT代币解锁规则，代币上线后有30%（30亿）的代币在流通，包括。10%的 “BitDAO Vault”，5%的 \"初始合作伙伴奖励 \"和15%的Bybit锁定资金。根据目前的价格，其目前的流通市值约为48亿美金，与XMR和FTT基本持平，超过了Pancake。\n\n# BitDAO经济模式\n\n● 代币BIT：治理代币+平台代币 \n ● 商业模式：开发defi产品，孵化defi项目，并提供流动性。 \n ● 收入来源1：Bybit利润的50%（约400万美元/天） \n ● 收入来源2：BitDAO的未来业务收入。\n\n# 治理\n\n● BitDAO由BIT代币持有者拥有和治理，以下行动只有在成功的提案和投票后才能执行。 \n ● 与现有和新兴项目进行代币交换。 \n ● 将资金分配给各种战略。 \n ● 对合作伙伴项目的流动性支持。 \n ● 对开发团队和研发中心的拨款或里程碑奖励（建立BitDAO产品，或支持合作伙伴产品）。 \n ● 对区块链技术项目、教育项目或其他区块链公共产品的资助。 \n ● 对BitDAO核心协议的更新（包括治理和财务管理功能）。\n\n# 原则\n\n● BitDAO不是一个公司。它没有一个治理团队或员工。 \n ● BitDAO是一个贡献者的集合。贡献者将持有BIT代币，并有动力使该项目获得成功。 \n ● 不同的个人和团队将提出对BitDAO协议的修改。由BIT持有人投票接受或拒绝这些建议。 \n ● 持有BIT使个人有权提交提案并进行投票。但它并不赋予将个人的意愿强加给其他贡献者的权利。 \n ● BitDAO将是一个不断发展的项目，社区领袖将随着时间的推移而出现。治理建议和论坛参与将影响项目的方向。 \n ● BitDAO的愿景和使命将由代币持有人、贡献者和社区领袖推动。\n\n# 最初的治理政策\n\nBitDAO旨在鼓励对BitDAO项目的贡献，并非所有问题都需要通过正式的治理提案。 \n 正式的BitDAO提案。 \n ● 涉及任何BitDAO财政资产的交易，包括赠与、互换、包装和抵押。 \n ● 对BitDAO核心协议的代码更新，例外情况包括安全发布。 \n 非正式的BitDAO提案。 \n ● 创建一个BitDAO附属的黑客马拉松或活动，贡献者承担费用。 \n ● 创建一个BitDAO附属的研究和开发实体，以建立产品，贡献者承担费用。\n\n# 每一个BIT都很重要\n\nBitDAO是由BIT代币持有者拥有和治理的。它的初始政策是只有在上述的成功提案和投票后才会执行行动，这同时也是在与BitDAO社区讨论后可以改变的。\n\n# 第一阶段\n\nBitDAO将利用Gnosis Safe的行业标准设置，Gnosis Snapshot链外治理，以及多签名管理员。\n\n**BitDAO金库 (Gnosis Safe)** \n BitDAO将使用Gnosis Safe来存储金库资产。Gnosis Safe通常被加密货币项目用于对以太坊地址进行多重签名控制。 \n BitDAO的主要金库合同地址是： \n https://etherscan.io/address/0x78605Df79524164911C144801f41e9811B7DB73D\n\n**治理模块（Gnosis Snapshot）** \n Gnosis Snapshot是一个链下投票聚合平台。Snapshot支持许多行业领先的区块链和DeFi项目的链外治理，如Balancer、Yearn Finance、SushiSwap、Uniswap、Bancor、The Graph和Aave。我们选择Snapshot作为链外投票汇总平台，使治理对我们的用户来说简单而透明。它是一个久经考验的解决方案，具有良好的用户界面和用户体验。 \n 基于快照的治理，通常被称为 \"软 \"治理，因为投票的结果不会自动执行 – 它需要开发和运营团队执行后续行动，并通过多重签名来执行变化。 \n BitDAO快照空间：https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth\n\n**治理代币（BIT）** \n BitDAO的治理代币，BIT，是Compound Finance的治理代币COMP的一个实例。这已经被选中，而不是标准的ERC-20代币，因为它支持1）委托投票，和2）链外投票汇总，有可能在以后的阶段转移到链上治理。 \n BIT代币合约地址是： \n https://etherscan.io/address/0x1A4b46696b2bB4794Eb3D4c26f1c55F9170fa4C5\n\n**其他治理讨论** \n 在社区的Discord和论坛中，将有一个单独的频道来讨论关于赠款、代币交换、协议路线图和治理的想法。获得足够社区支持的想法可以提交投票。社区成员可以为Snapshot起草一个软提案，从而导致正式的社区投票。这样的提案可以作为一个 \"温度测试 \"或投票，但不保证实施。这个想法需要被一个开发团队采纳，最终的代码被审核并提交，然后由多签管理员部署\n\n**委托投票** \n BIT持有人在将其投票权委托给一个地址之前，不能投票或创建提案。委托一次可以给一个地址，包括持有人自己的地址。\n\n**多重签名管理员** \n 在第一阶段，BitDAO库房（Gnosis Safe）和快照空间由一个多签名钱包管理。最初的设置是由Bybit团队提名的5个签名者中的3个。 与其他DeFi项目类似，我们将寻求社区的建议，以更广泛地分配签名密钥（例如，12个签名者中的6个）。对多签名者或规则的修改建议将通过快照建议和投票程序提交。 \n 提案和投票参数\n\n**定义** \n **快照策略** \n 定义了每个代币的投票权重。BitDAO的初始设置是1个BIT=1投票权重，所以每个BIT的投票权相等。未来的策略可能包括：将投票权重分配给xBIT或BIT-ETH LP代币，以使已经抵押、包装或提供流动性的BIT持有人保留投票权。\n\n**提案门槛** \n \"提案门槛 \"通常被定义为创建一个提案所需的投票数。在BitDAO快照空间中，这是通过视觉过滤器完成的，只显示来自BIT代币达到阈值数量用户的提案。\n\n**投票时间** \n 投票开始和投票结束之间的时间长度。\n\n**投票门槛** \n 对一项提案进行投票所需的最低票数权重（BIT代币）。如果没有达到这个最低限度，即使多数票投了赞成票，投票也是不成功的。\n\n# 第二阶段\n\nBitDAO将寻求建立一个定制的治理模块，最有可能参考链上可升级的解决方案，如Compound Governor Bravo。 \n BitDAO的附属研发中心正在为第二阶段建立一个定制的治理模块。其目的是提高BIT代币持有人的权力，并支持BitDAO未来的产品和功能。BitDAO欢迎社区在他们设计新的治理模块时提供反馈，特别是与权衡有关的反馈：例如，Gas费用、治理过程效率、链上/链下、安全、用户参与等。\n\n**关键要求** \n 可升级（可能依靠代理合同和代理模式）。 \n 链上提案和投票 \n ● 控制BitDAO治理参数（投票权重策略、提案门槛、投票门槛、投票时间） \n ● 控制未来的BitDAO产品参数（费用，阈值等） \n ● 可以被其他DAO轻松修改和利用 \n 不错的选择 \n ● 授权给多人（而不是授权给一人） \n ● 可以不通过委托进行投票 \n ● 委托X个区块（时间锁定） \n ● 对提案和投票进行单独的委托 \n ● 常见有效载荷的模板（即代币交换、授予等的可执行代码 \n 要考虑的是 \n ● 没有多重签名的备份或超控\n\n# 团队成员\n\n除了其早期合作伙伴和目前的首席运营官 \"Arby Leonian \"之外，关于BitDAO团队成员的信息并不多。 \n 推特账户: https://twitter.com/arbyleonian\n\n**BitDAO 早期合作伙伴** \n ● Peter Thiel \n ● Founders Fund \n ● Pantera Capital \n ● Dragonfly Capital \n ● Alan Howard \n ● Bybit \n ● Spartan Group \n ● SushiSwap \n ● Kain Warwick (founder of Synthetix) \n ● Polygon \n ● Jump Capital \n ● Peak Capital \n ● Amber \n ● Cambium Grove Capital \n ● Coinhako \n ● Fenbushi Capital \n ● Tembusu Partners \n ● NGC Ventures \n ● LongHash Ventures \n ● alphanonce \n ● iAngels Blockchain \n ● Univalues Associates \n ● mgnr \n ● The London & Amsterdam Trust Company Limited \n ● PreAngel \n ● Fintelics \n ● Pythagoras Investments \n ● Wemade Tree \n ● Kenetic \n ● The Brooker Group \n ● Kronos\n\n# 总结\n\n从以上内容我们可以了解到，BitDAO既是一个DAO组织，又是Bybit项目的一半。其代币BIT既是治理代币，又是Bybit的平台货币（Bybit一半的收益都捐给了BitDAO）。BitDAO是Bybit通过DAO向去中心化的转型。无论如何，Bybit已经走上了一条业内前所未有的平台货币发行之路，其未来的发展可能由BitDAO自己来探索。\n\n# 资源\n\n● BitDAO网站:

Bybit has pledged recurring contributions to the BitDAO treasury which at 2021 rates exceeds $1B per year with a vision of open finance and a decentralized tokenized economy through DeFI technology. For this reason, BitDAO is banking on the success of DeFi and will allocate massive financial and talent resources to support DeFi growth.\n\n# Background\n\nDeFi technology allows for unstoppable and permissionless financial transactions on the blockchain, including trading, lending, and creation of synthetic assets. With no signup process, no middlemen approvals, no middleman execution, DeFi will fundamentally disrupt traditional finance and is likely to become a trillion dollar sector. Tokenization has broadened the scope of property rights, and enabled new economic models for DAOs, collectible NFTs, and gaming.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gcoKPLH4gIGeXsSfczNPi.png?height=422&width=936)\n\nBitDAO positions itself as one of the largest DAOs in the world, and its vision is to open finance and a decentralized tokenized economy. It’s a collection of contributors. Overtime, community leaders will appear. BitDAO’s vision and mission will be promoted by token holders, contributors and community leaders.\n\nTo put it simply, DAO initiates proposals through blockchain and smart contracts to coordinate member actions and resources. Members can vote on proposals through voting. The more tokens they hold, the greater the voting power. Nowadays, DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) has also become an important direction for many DeFi projects such as Maker.\n\n“BitDAO is a DAO controlled by BIT token holders. It is not a company and has no management team or employees. Any individual, development team or R&D laboratory can propose upgrades, token transactions, and partnership proposals for BitDAO BIT token holders will vote to decide whether to approve or reject these proposals.” BitDAO officials said, and hope to support the development of the DeFi industry through the use of DAO, specifically working in three directions:\n\n* Research and development –– BitDAO partners will establish R&D centers, develop BitDAO core protocols (governance and fund management), develop BitDAO DeFi products, support DeFi partners, and provide incubation services for emerging DeFi projects.\n* Fluidity –– BitDAO will control one of the largest asset pools, which can be used to provide liquidity for partner agreements. BitDAO can guide new protocols, such as DEX, lending, and synthesis.\n* Funds –– BitDAO will support blockchain technology through grants (such as through Gitcoin) and support DeFi projects through token transactions.\n\nThe popularity of BitDAO is inseparable from the contribution of Bybit, the main derivatives exchange behind it. According to the announcement, Bybit promised to contribute 0.025% of its futures contract trading volume as income to BitDAo vault, and make regular donations. The official estimate given by BitDAo is that the annual revenue will exceed 1 billion US dollars. After inquiry, it was found that Bybit did make regular donations to BitDAo every day in accordance with its commitment, and the average daily donation amount was close to 4 million U.S. dollars as shown below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vo0Wq9GZ7MYEFcn-ES5Gv.png?height=678&width=936)\n\nThe average daily contribution is US$4 million, which is about half of the income. Bybit funding BitDAo obviously has its own considerations. Previously, the UK Financial Supervisory Authority and the Ontario Securities Commission of Canada both prohibited Bybit from providing services to its citizens, and ByBit subsequently ceased services in the region. With the tightening of global supervision, crypto derivatives trading platforms are facing transformation: one is to follow the path of compliance and cater to the supervision; the second is to take the path of decentralization through DAO. Binance chose the former and Bybit chose the latter. From this perspective, BIT can also be regarded as Bybit’s “platform currency”.\n\n# Bybit’s impact on BitDAO\n\nThe value of BitDAO mainly comes from Bybit empowerment, so let’s take a look at the current status of Bybit first. As we all know, Bybit is a rising star in the derivatives track, second only to the three major exchanges, and surpasses second and third from time to time. Bybit’s own spot function is weak. Although the Huobi team is currently intensively developing, there is still a long way to go to catch up with other exchanges. BIT’s spot trading also needs to rely on other exchanges. On the other hand, Bybit is currently large in size and has received strict attention from regulatory agencies in various countries. Therefore, it pays special attention to compliance. Coupled with the requirement for the transparency of the “DAO”, expenditures need to be disclosed. Obviously, it is impossible to pull offers.\n\n# Growth\n\nBitDAO looks to partner with projects through tokens swaps and co-development efforts and that is to increase the growth of the community:\n\n* Swap –– BitDAO aims to token swap and accumulate a collection of the top existing and emerging DeFi and crypto projects. Swaps will align their interests. BitDAO will be incentivized to support these partner projects to become category leaders. One priority is Spot and Derivatives DEXes.\n* Build –– BitDAO aims to build core products which enable BitDAO or other DAOs to function more effectively, these include:\n* Governance suite –– a set of on-chain and off-chain products and best practices.\n* Treasury Management –– ability for DAOs to deploy and monitor assets to earn yield or bootstrap products.\n* Grant –– BitDAO aims to provide grants to teams that produce research or products that are public goods for the crypto industry. One possibility is to match Gitcoin grants. \n The benefit comes from the success of partners and the industry as a whole. With billions in assets and recurring contributions, BitDAO will continue to create partnerships, accumulate the best DeFi assets, and build useful products. The partners and products will then contribute to the BitDAO treasury, creating a compounding and accumulation dynamic.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hxGxm7OqPsLNdgNTSNCo7.png?height=494&width=936)\n\n# Token distribution\n\n* 30% BitDAO Treasury will be held by the treasury to promote ecosystem swaps.\n* 5% will be provided as a reward to the initial partner at the start of the project.\n* 60% Bybit will be allocated to Bybit to establish an R&D center to support BitDAO and support the growth of Bybit which, in turn, can help the growth of BitDAO’s fund library. Among them, 15% of the token supply can be used immediately, and the remaining 45% of the token supply can be used immediately. The supply of licenses will be locked for 1 year and will be gradually released within 2 years after the end of the lock-up period.\n\n# Token lock-up and release\n\nAccording to the BIT token unlocking rules, 30% (3 billion) of the tokens are in circulation after the token goes online, including: 10% of the “BitDAO Vault”, 5% of the “Initial Partner Rewards” and 15% of Bybit Lock up funds. Based on the current price, its current circulating market value is about 4.8B US dollars, which is basically the same as XMR and FTT, and surpasses Pancake.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Av3zl0inf3I_gQ6_bzlJQ.png?height=492&width=936)\n\n# BitDAO economic model\n\nToken BIT: governance token + platform token \n Business model: develop defi products, incubate defi projects, and provide liquidity. \n Source of income 1: 50% of Bybit’s profit (approximately US$4 million per day) \n Source of income 2: BitDAO’s future business revenue.\n\n# Governance\n\nBitDAO is owned and governed by BIT token holders, with the following actions executed only after a successful proposal and vote:\n\n* token swaps with existing and emerging projects.\n* treasury allocation into various strategies.\n* liquidity support for partner projects.\n* grants or milestone rewards to development teams and R&D centers (to build BitDAO products, or support partner products).\n* grants to blockchain technology projects, education programs, or other blockchain public goods.\n* updates to BitDAO core protocols (including governance and treasury management functions)\n\n# Principles\n\n* BitDAO is not a company. It does not have a management team or employees.\n* BitDAO is a collection of contributors. Contributors will hold BIT tokens and are motivated to make the project a success.\n* Various individuals and teams will propose changes to the BitDAO protocol. It is up to BIT holders to vote to accept or reject these proposals.\n* Holding BIT entitles you to submit and vote on proposals. It does not entitle you to impose your will upon other contributors.\n* BitDAO will be an evolving project, and community leaders will emerge over time. Governance proposals and forum participation will affect the direction of the project.\n* The vision and mission of BitDAO will be driven by token holders, contributors, and community leaders.\n\n# Initial Governance Policies\n\nBitDAO aims to encourage contribution to the BitDAO project and not all issues need to go through formal governance proposals. \n Requires formal BitDAO proposals:\n\n* Transactions involving any BitDAO Treasury assets including grants, swaps, wrapping, and staking.\n* Code updates to BitDAO core protocols, exceptions include security releases. \n Does not require formal BitDAO proposals:\n* Creating a BitDAO affiliated hackathon or event, where the contributor covers the expense.\n* Creating a BtiDAO affiliated research & development entity to build products, where the contributor covers the expense.\n\n# Every BIT Counts\n\nBitDAO is owned and governed by BIT token holders. It’s initial policy is for the actions to be executed only after a successful proposal and vote as mentioned above, which is at the same time changeable after discussions with the BitDAO community.\n\n# Phase 1\n\nBitDAO will utilize the industry standard setup of Gnosis Safe, Gnosis Snapshot off-chain governance, and multi-sig administrators.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nZ-e1OT4QjkxAak3wTI8A.png?height=838&width=936)\n\n**BitDAO Treasury (Gnosis Safe)** \n BitDAO will use Gnosis Safe to store treasury assets. Gnosis Safe is commonly used by crypto projects for multi-sig control over an Ethereum address.\n\n* The main BitDAO treasury contract address is: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78605Df79524164911C144801f41e9811B7DB73D\n\n**Governance Module (Gnosis Snapshot)** \n Gnosis Snapshot is an off-chain vote aggregation platform. Snapshot supports off-chain governance for many industry leading blockchain and DeFi projects such as Balancer, Yearn Finance, SushiSwap, Uniswap, Bancor, The Graph, and Aave. We chose Snapshot as an off-chain vote aggregation platform to make governance simple and transparent for our users. It is a tried and true solution with a great user interface and user experience. \n Snapshot-based governance, is commonly referred to as “soft” governance as the result of the vote is not automatically implemented –– it requires a development and operations team to perform subsequent actions, and implementation of changes via a multi-sig.\n\n* BitDAO Snapshot Space: https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth\n\n**Governance Token (BIT)** \n BitDAO’s governance token, BIT, is an instance of Compound Finance’s governance token COMP. This has been selected instead of a standard ERC-20 token, as it supports 1) delegated voting, and 2) off-chain vote aggregation with the potential of moving to on-chain governance at a later phase.\n\n* The BIT token contract address is: https://etherscan.io/address/0x1A4b46696b2bB4794Eb3D4c26f1c55F9170fa4C5\n\n**Other Governance Discussions** \n In the community Discord and Forum, there will be a separate channel to discuss ideas around grants, token swaps, protocol roadmap, and governance. Ideas that garner enough community support can be submitted for voting. A community member may draft a soft proposal for Snapshot that leads to an official community vote. Such proposals act as a “temperature test” or a poll, but do not guarantee implementation. The idea needs to be adopted by a development team, with finalized code audited and submitted, then deployed by the multi-sig administrators.\n\n**Delegated Voting** \n BIT holders cannot vote or create proposals until they delegate their voting rights to an address. Delegation can be given to one address at a time, including the holder’s own address.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vGMmiyGmL11c4ayKOC2UX.png?height=418&width=936)\n\n**Multi-Sig Administrators** \n In Phase 1, BitDAO treasury (Gnosis Safe) and Snapshot Space are administered by a multi-sig wallet. The initial setup is 3 of 5 signers whom have been nominated by the Bybit Team. Similar to other DeFi projects, we will look to community suggestions to distribute the signing keys more widely (for example 6 of 12 signers). Proposed changes to multi-sig signers or rules will be submitted via Snapshot proposal and voting process. \n Proposal and Voting Parameters\n\n**Definitions \n Snapshot Strategy** \n Defines the vote weight of each token. BitDAO initial setting is 1 BIT = 1 vote weight, so each BIT has equal voting power. Future strategies may include: allocating vote weight to xBIT or BIT-ETH LP tokens to enable BIT holders who have staked, wrapped, or provided liquidity to retain voting power.\n\n**Proposal Threshold**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/95C5MZG3YMHRBMnaG8e0I.png?height=358&width=936)\n\n“Proposal Threshold” is typically defined as the number of votes required to create a proposal. In BitDAO Snapshot Space this is done through a visual filter, to only display proposals from users who have at least the threshold number of BIT tokens delegated to their address.\n\n**Vote Duration** \n The length of time between voting start and voting end.\n\n**Vote Threshold** \n The minimum number vote weight (BIT tokens) required to vote on a proposal. If this minimum is not met, the vote is unsuccessful even if the majority of votes voted yes.\n\n# Phase 2\n\nBitDAO will look to build a custom governance module, most likely referencing on-chain upgradable solutions such as Compound Governor Bravo. \n BitDAO affiliated R&D centers are working on building a custom governance module for Phase 2. The objective is to enhance the power of BIT token holders, and support BitDAO future products and functionality. BitDAO welcomes the community feedback as they design the new governance module, especially in relation to tradeoffs: eg. gas fees, governance process efficiency, onchain/off-chain, security, user participation, etc.\n\n**Key requirements**\n\n* Upgradable (probably relying on proxy contract, and proxy patterns)\n* Onchain proposal and voting\n* Control BitDAO governance parameters (vote weight strategy, proposal threshold, voting threshold, vote duration)\n* Control future BitDAO product parameters (fees, thresholds, etc.)\n* Can be easily modified and utilized by other DAOs \n **Nice to have**\n* Delegate-to-many (instead of delegate-to-one)\n* Can vote without delegating\n* Delegate for X number of blocks (time lock)\n* Separate delegation for proposal and voting\n* Templates for common payloads (i.e. executable code for token swaps, grants, etc.) \n **To be considered**\n* No multi-sig backup or override\n\n# Team members\n\nThere is not that much information about BitDAO team members except for its tremendous early partners and the current Chief Operating Officer which is “Arby Leonian”. \n Twitter Account: https://twitter.com/arbyleonian \n **BitDAO Early Partners** \n ● Peter Thiel \n ● Founders Fund \n ● Pantera Capital \n ● Dragonfly Capital \n ● Alan Howard \n ● Bybit \n ● Spartan Group \n ● SushiSwap \n ● Kain Warwick (founder of Synthetix) \n ● Polygon \n ● Jump Capital \n ● Peak Capital \n ● Amber \n ● Cambium Grove Capital \n ● Coinhako \n ● Fenbushi Capital \n ● Tembusu Partners \n ● NGC Ventures \n ● LongHash Ventures \n ● alphanonce \n ● iAngels Blockchain \n ● Univalues Associates \n ● mgnr \n ● The London & Amsterdam Trust Company Limited \n ● PreAngel \n ● Fintelics \n ● Pythagoras Investments \n ● Wemade Tree \n ● Kenetic \n ● The Brooker Group \n ● Kronos\n\n# Summarize\n\nFrom the above, we can understand that BitDAO is both a DAO organization and half of the Bybit project. Its token BIT is both a governance token and a platform currency of Bybit (half of Bybit’s proceeds are donated to BitDAO). BitDAO is Bybit’s transformation to decentralization through DAO. In any case, Bybit has embarked on an unprecedented path of platform currency release in the industry, and its future development may be explored by BitDAO itself.\n\n# Resources\n\nBitDAO website: https://www.bitdao.io/ \n BitDAO core information: https://docs.bitdao.io/ \n TLDR and Graphic Assets: notion \n Twitter: https://twitter.com/BitDAO_Official \n Discord: https://discord.gg/jTBC4BKnj7 \n Telegram: https://t.me/BitDAO_Official \n Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitDAO \n Medium: https://medium.com/bitdao \n LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitdao \n Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bitdao_official/ \n Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BitDAOOfficial/ \n Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/bitdao\n\n## Protocol Related\n\n● BIT Token: 0x1A4b46696b2bB4794Eb3D4c26f1c55F9170fa4C5 \n ● Treasury: 0x78605Df79524164911C144801f41e9811B7DB73D \n ● Snapshot Space: https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth \n ● Delegation Page: https://delegate.bitdaotools.io/ \n ● GitHub: TBD\n\n\n---\n\n通过 DAO，研究组织和媒体可以打破地域的限制，以社区的方式资助和生产内容。DAOrayaki将会通过DAO的形式，构建一个代表社区意志并由社区控制的功能齐全的去中心化媒体。欢迎通过文末方式提交与DAO、量子计算、星际移民、DA相关的内容，瓜分10000USDC赏金池！欢迎加入DAOrayaki社区，了解去中心化自治组织（DAO），探讨最新话题！\n\n官方网站：<https://daorayaki.org>\n\nMedia：<https://media.daorayaki.org>\n\nDiscord server: <https://discord.gg/wNUPmsGsa4>\n\nMedium: <https://medium.com/@daorayaki>\n\nEmail: [daorayaki@dorafactory.org](mailto:daorayaki@dorafactory.org)\n\nTwitter: @daorayaki_\n\n微信助手：DAOrayaki-Media\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LiumEgSHLM4E5E-7WZnzZ.png?height=430&width=430)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653368901, "digest": "B1rt2T1_U84uOOmue0uf9vRm11ww4FWE6OharotV3_g", "contributor": "0xF22b4cE3b2d153290Be6E97CB514dEff04799AfB"}

But it’s been on my mind in recent months — I’ve watched a new “language” emerge for the new technologies and behaviors that exist in web3, specifically with regards to the word “wallet.” More importantly, I don’t think we’re choosing the right words.\n\n[https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1517350655639183360?s=20&t=9e2JCImcwFBeZNi4Hbq2-g](https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1517350655639183360?s=20&t=9e2JCImcwFBeZNi4Hbq2-g)\n\n**The word “wallet” falls short in a few different ways.** Wallets in the traditional sense are static objects — they don’t change or adapt over time. They also don’t necessarily accumulate in value; wallets are purely storage facilities for capital, which, in turn, makes NFTs feel like capital assets. And if we want to get *really* pedantic, the word “wallet” often tricks people into thinking it holds actual funds as opposed to your keys.\n\nIt’s also important to consider how the purpose of a wallet has changed over the last few years. To date, almost all wallets have been built and designed around transactions\\*.\\* Many wallets are 3+ years old and were built solely for the purpose of buying, trading, and holding tokens. Since then, as the ecosystem has continued to expand, the purpose of the wallet has evolved. Now, we’re seeing more demand for wallets as a place to hold NFTs (see [Genesis](https://www.genesis.xyz/), [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) or [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)) and multimedia experiences (see [Glass](https://glass.xyz/), [DRAUP](https://mirror.xyz/0x76E1E457d43FC12Ec262dE85cCA410133b75f2Cc/8Bgs1hn69d7QRXDWmHHNW9S35-2zc28rkJbaJngvRPE), and [Altered State Machine](https://www.alteredstatemachine.xyz/)). Put simply, wallets are becoming a place where people want to spend time. Existing wallets will not (and, candidly, cannot) adapt to this new preference in behavior.\n\nWhen we think about how wallets — and what we call them — might continue to evolve, we can look to the factors that drove user adoption for previous wallets that reached mass scale. As a case study, MetaMask had 545,000 MAUs in July 2020. This shot up to [over 10M by August 2021](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/metamask-users-defi-ethereum-decentralized-finance-consensys-crypto-2021-8), driven by a surge of interest in “DeFi Summer,” where yield farming acted as a hook for consumers. At that time, it was an obvious choice for consumers to use MetaMask to take advantage of DeFi yields, as MetaMask was far more accessible (widely supported) than any competitor.\n\nWe can draw similarities between this example and the web3 ecosystem today. Supply of NFT projects, new yield farming opportunities, and social web3 platforms are all at an all-time high and only growing. Legacy wallets will initially consume new demand, but as the variety of applications, use cases, and behaviors expands, users (and developers) will need *integrated, verticalized wallets* that are more dynamic/supportive of leveraging on-chain provenance and transporting your digital identity across apps & chains. If this hypothesis is true, I expect to see an emergence of embedded wallets for different verticals or themes, each with their own terminology to onboard new users. Perhaps your digital fashion will be stored in a wardrobe, and you’ll show off your music NFTs by way of a discography.\n\nMy talented friend & fellow investor [Jay Drain](https://twitter.com/jay_drainjr/status/1484206427593842690?s=20) said it best: “Right now, crypto wallets look very much like inventories… in the future they will more clearly represent our digital identities by making them composable across the web.” I recommend you check out his full piece [here](https://jaydrainjr.substack.com/p/crypto-wallet?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTU4NDE2MywicG9zdF9pZCI6NDc0MDk5NDAsIl8iOiJOZUVZcyIsImlhdCI6MTY0MjY5NzI2MCwiZXhwIjoxNjQyNzAwODYwLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMjQ2NTUyIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.xwioKhWCXbZ3lhbut7SgKzAtnaWKBXbhh5hHdeEqfBM).\n\n**To use language as a mode for coming to terms with our surroundings is to accept that our language structures our experience of the world. Perhaps this — inquiring into our own linguistically-induced blind spots — is what’s really in a name, after all.**\n\n\n---\n\n*Related: [Do we see reality as it is?](https://www.ted.com/talks/donald_hoffman_do_we_see_reality_as_it_is)* \n\n*Thank you to D’Arcy Coolican, Zach Davidson, Jarrod Dicker, Brandon Jacoby, Dani Loftus, Sean Thielen-Esparza, Zach Terrell, and many others for informing my thinking on this piece.

Now, we’re seeing more demand for wallets as a place to hold NFTs (see [Genesis](https://www.genesis.xyz/), [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) or [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)) and multimedia experiences (see [Glass](https://glass.xyz/), [DRAUP](https://mirror.xyz/0x76E1E457d43FC12Ec262dE85cCA410133b75f2Cc/8Bgs1hn69d7QRXDWmHHNW9S35-2zc28rkJbaJngvRPE), and [Altered State Machine](https://www.alteredstatemachine.xyz/)). Put simply, wallets are becoming a place where people want to spend time. Existing wallets will not (and, candidly, cannot) adapt to this new preference in behavior.\n\nWhen we think about how wallets — and what we call them — might continue to evolve, we can look to the factors that drove user adoption for previous wallets that reached mass scale. As a case study, MetaMask had 545,000 MAUs in July 2020. This shot up to [over 10M by August 2021](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/metamask-users-defi-ethereum-decentralized-finance-consensys-crypto-2021-8), driven by a surge of interest in “DeFi Summer,” where yield farming acted as a hook for consumers. At that time, it was an obvious choice for consumers to use MetaMask to take advantage of DeFi yields, as MetaMask was far more accessible (widely supported) than any competitor.\n\nWe can draw similarities between this example and the web3 ecosystem today. Supply of NFT projects, new yield farming opportunities, and social web3 platforms are all at an all-time high and only growing. Legacy wallets will initially consume new demand, but as the variety of applications, use cases, and behaviors expands, users (and developers) will need *integrated, verticalized wallets* that are more dynamic/supportive of leveraging on-chain provenance and transporting your digital identity across apps & chains. If this hypothesis is true, I expect to see an emergence of embedded wallets for different verticals or themes, each with their own terminology to onboard new users. Perhaps your digital fashion will be stored in a wardrobe, and you’ll show off your music NFTs by way of a discography.\n\nMy talented friend & fellow investor [Jay Drain](https://twitter.com/jay_drainjr/status/1484206427593842690?s=20) said it best: “Right now, crypto wallets look very much like inventories… in the future they will more clearly represent our digital identities by making them composable across the web.” I recommend you check out his full piece [here](https://jaydrainjr.substack.com/p/crypto-wallet?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTU4NDE2MywicG9zdF9pZCI6NDc0MDk5NDAsIl8iOiJOZUVZcyIsImlhdCI6MTY0MjY5NzI2MCwiZXhwIjoxNjQyNzAwODYwLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMjQ2NTUyIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.xwioKhWCXbZ3lhbut7SgKzAtnaWKBXbhh5hHdeEqfBM).\n\n**To use language as a mode for coming to terms with our surroundings is to accept that our language structures our experience of the world. Perhaps this — inquiring into our own linguistically-induced blind spots — is what’s really in a name, after all.**\n\n\n---\n\n*Related: [Do we see reality as it is?](https://www.ted.com/talks/donald_hoffman_do_we_see_reality_as_it_is)* \n\n*Thank you to D’Arcy Coolican, Zach Davidson, Jarrod Dicker, Brandon Jacoby, Dani Loftus, Sean Thielen-Esparza, Zach Terrell, and many others for informing my thinking on this piece.

It would’ve been a crime not to. But the night turns into morning and we are feeling a hangover worse than ever before.\n\nWelcome to this month’s episode: **Markets**.\n\nIt’s no surprise purchasing power is decreasing, public equities are taking a beating, and consumer debt levels are looking unstable. Though, in the face of all this, in the words of Brad Gerstner, “technology’s value creation and positive impact on humanity has never been steeper - but wars and economic cycles remain… Embrace the first, but survive the second.”\n\nWe’ve got a lot to unpack today. Let’s begin.\n\n**Value Creation of a Country**\n\nEvery year the United States measures its **value** by calculating the total goods and services produced by the country, formally known as **gross domestic product (GDP)**. When new capital is introduced into the system, its intended purpose is to ultimately ***create more goods and services***. For the sake of today’s conversation, I took into account the amount of money printed by the federal reserve and analyzed whether it had a meaningful impact on America’s GDP. ***The results of this observation unveiled a misuse of capital, and unfortunately, a dark, but unsurprising truth that begins to explain the current market downturn.***\n\n**Money Supply vs. GDP**\n\nThese past two years, the fed printed an insane amount of money. The chart below indicates the steep rise in M2 money supply - the total volume of currency held by the public.\n\n![5-Yr U.S. M2 Money Supply Chart](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ldr9Uhob4rVDsN5g0vUid.png?height=894&width=1706)\n\nThe purpose of releasing this capital into the hands of the public was to “stimulate” the economy. The best measure of economic stimulus and health is GDP. Charted below.\n\n![5-Yr U.S. GDP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OxNCp43CTp4qD9fsUZFFW.png?height=900&width=1708)\n\nGDP seemingly does go up and to the right, but if we dig into the numbers, we see a not-so-pretty picture. The quick math below comparing money supply to GDP indicates the new money created was not used productively. \n\n![GDP-to-M2 ratio](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m2bh-cWTUDDj22O-VO9Wf.png?height=264&width=708)\n\nThe goal of a country should be to maximize the market value of goods and services created as the available resources (i.e. money) to create G/S increases. Theoretically, this multiple should get higher over time, but at the very least, remain constant. For example, if you can make 5 burgers with $10, you should, at the very least, be able to make 10 burgers with $20. If this multiple trends downward, it’s safe to assume capital is not being allocated in a productive manner.\n\n**In our case, we had more resources, but did not create more value.**\n\nInstead, money flowed directly into financial assets (skipping actually creating value) and inflated the paper value of stocks. We didn’t really use the money printer to stimulate the economy. We used it to create asset bubbles.\n\n**Stock Market Correlation**\n\nIf that’s not enough to make you believe, something I read in Chamath’s most recent [annual letter](https://www.socialcapital.com/ideas/2021-annual-letter) left my mouth wide open.\n\n“*Since 2018, the correlation between the S&P 500 and M2 YoY growth was 0.92! In layman’s terms, as ‘the money printer went brrr,’ the stock market went up dollar for dollar.”*\n\nWhen the government releases capital into the system, it is meant to ***stimulate*** the economy i.e. *create new businesses, jobs, and goods and services*. Instead, capital flowed directly into **financial assets**. As a result, the paper value of stocks rose, but the actual productivity remained flat. We’re now witnessing the artificial bubble pop, and admittedly, it’s been quite painful to watch.\n\n**The Domino Effect**\n\n**Public Markets**:\n\n1. Money floods the system ***(M2 money supply goes up)***\n2. Consumers feel more wealthy and begin to purchase goods and services at a rapid rate ***(high demand)***\n3. Too many dollars chasing too few goods ***(low supply)***\n4. In response, businesses raise prices ***(inflation)***\n5. Fed increases rates to discourage borrowing and spending ***(leads to high cost of capital, but meant to cool demand and lower inflation)***\n6. Fundamental valuations fall due to higher cost of capital, higher hurdle rates stall professional investors, retail investors sell-off shares to cover the rising cost of everyday goods **(lower share prices)**\n\n**Private Markets:**\n\n1.

NFT的一种玩法.**\n\n**以下图狗群战绩:**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uqpjmxWoaDqEfet3qeJVW.png?height=1035&width=3320)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xWPVMHMYpDRHMlCMUNEnQ.png?height=460&width=961)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FhbBVaTrwLCnw8kwnZMWO.png?height=481&width=858)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IW4a9joIrLTtEVDWdC5Ow.png?height=1550&width=767)\n\n\n---\n\n## 风险提示\n\n**请一定不要用主钱包去Mint, 创建一个新钱包, 放里一些gas费用就可以了.**\n\n**如果在Mint过程中出现让你授权的就要小心, 一般只是需要签名, 不要授权.**\n\n**有一些NFT在Mint后是不能上架Opensea的, 遇到这种,要么你提前有时间去先查一下, 要么你就认了.**\n\n**如果不小心授权了. 请尽快取消授权.什么?不会取消授权?私聊我我教你.**\n\n\n---\n\n## 背景\n\n我的[Freemint](https://twitter.com/free_mint_bot) 播报[机器人](https://twitter.com/free_mint_bot)已经运行了一段时间, 每天都能打到金狗, 每天都有人问我如何Mint?\n\n**如果你还没关注, 请先关注FreeMint播报机器人推特:** [twitter.com/free_mint_bot](http://twitter.com/free_mint_bot)\n\n**然后点亮小铃铛!**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LS8jLP41NeJfyqLQozCnY.png?height=1460&width=1136)\n\n那么如何Mint呢? 如果你一直关注我: [twitter.com/zlexdl](http://twitter.com/zlexdl) ,一直学习的话, 我觉得你很轻松就能找到答案.\n\n在我发的 <<使用RSS筛选币圈有用的信息>>文章中, 教会你了如何掌握币圈的大量信息.\n\n只要简单的搜索一下关键词就能轻松找到答案, 可惜没几个人这么做吧.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/zlexdl.eth/CZR_mSfTNm0vfPdx1YDTi0zaM-X1vxeURz_f8078RrM](https://mirror.xyz/zlexdl.eth/CZR_mSfTNm0vfPdx1YDTi0zaM-X1vxeURz_f8078RrM)\n\n\n---\n\n**言归正传, 说一下如何mint, mint 有三种途径.**\n\n### 第一种: 使用官方直接mint\n\n这一种,我想大家都会吧, 如果不会的话, 那就退圈吧.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HQdjDvA1Du1dtMThePZwt.png?height=1524&width=1126)\n\n链接Metamask小狐狸, 直接点击mint按钮,如果没有售空, 并且没有限制的话,就可以mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E3qFRSXE8Ap9fkFgqbOAg.png?height=1030&width=1422)\n\n**注意:很多合约是前多少名额是免费Mint的, 这样的我的机器人也会检测出来, 不要到时候来问我为什么不是免费的你还要发呢.**\n\n\n---\n\n### 第二种: 利用合约Mint\n\n有一些人就问我, 为啥机器人发的一些mint信息没有Website啊?\n\n因为这些图狗根本就没准备Website, 都是为了捞一波就跑的.\n\n这种情况就需要我们进行合约Mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zE-C75sLppsbc1UszgHWX.png?height=1734&width=1127)\n\n点击Etherscan后的链接之后就会看到以下画面.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lw9EXCrebONr8jduejln5.png?height=1632&width=2066)\n\n每个合约都不太一样, 如果你懂开发的话, 可以去 点击Code 按钮去看看代码,\n\n当然如果你开发的话, 你就不用看这篇文章了.\n\n具体Mint 步骤\n\n**1. 点击Connect to Web3 按钮去连接Metamask小狐狸钱包.**\n\n成功之后是这样的:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oQejgwHZdYiTedqC8psX.png?height=405&width=783)\n\n**2.一般方法区都会有Mint ,FreeMint, MintTo, publicMint或是其他带有mint的方法.**\n\n点击 1.FreeMint之后, 可以看到以下画面.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TpoC9xQupn5nNSKxCWctV.png?height=499&width=504)\n\n因为是免费Mint ,所以单价输入框要输入0, 数量输入你喜欢的, 但是这个经常会有限制, 有的是每个地址只能mint一个, 有的是每个地址只能mint10个, 每个合约都不太一样.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qaGBxKfjvAMsOV-orEUQ1.png?height=581&width=676)\n\n**3. 输入好之后点击Write按钮就可以mint了, 如果符合各种条件就会成功的.**\n\n但是当出现以下画面时就放弃吧, 如果你钱多可以给直接发给我.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PHnHgNn18ej8y-fasJ2pP.png?height=382&width=500)\n\n另外: 当你不知道哪个方法是可以mint的呢, 例如以下这个合约的方法, 找不出合适的mint方法\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rApKQ1jIsYFX6eUQAxB4R.png?height=1136&width=515)\n\n你就可以Transactions页面看看其他人都用什么方法.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NwaW7wyn2S7EDhhQd96LR.png?height=905&width=976)\n\n然后会再回到刚才的方法页面去试试, 就可以了.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/W0E0AJLSe_b2uyFnlJ3Wq.png?height=1038&width=1068)\n\n\n---\n\n### 第三种: 跟单Mint\n\n跟单Mint也叫十六进位数据Mint.\n\n就是使用其他人已经Mint的Input Data(十六进位数据)去mint.\n\n**准备工作:**\n\nMetamask小狐狸的【设置】-【高级】-【显示十六进制数据】点击成**启用**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wlvdOsj43Wwli2VQiUVcj.png?height=909&width=551)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gUbOTu_AQy_yFWtZwnBUz.png?height=903&width=553)\n\n在第二种方法已经说了, 先去Transactions页面去看其他人的传输记录.\n\n**去Transactions页面找到近期已经成功Mint并且Value为0的传输, 点击进去**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gywPQUMMi9tLclSPx62_c.png?height=960&width=2068)\n\n可以看出这个记录mint了4个, 那么你如果使用他Input data也会mint4个的, 这点需要注意.\n\n当然也不是没有办法修改的, 但是需要时间, 等你改完了就来不及了, 反正都是免费的.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BXLchbA72CX-RPHJCGja3.png?height=1682&width=1606)\n\n点击上图中左下角的 **Click to see More** 按钮后, 点击**View Input AS**后选择**Original**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/siHeRkhE72bAxmK2KvMHj.png?height=1047&width=1466)\n\n复制红框中的字符串\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3YG3HbQhlReGP53Thr1eB.png?height=396&width=1571)\n\n一定是项目合约地址，不是项目方地址, 千万别选错了,要不然就浪费gas了.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pKWxTzKQP1E-r-OmGj317.png?height=858&width=1357)\n\n这个也是合约地址.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y6gl5P0YYuqc4K5LuKwNx.png?height=154&width=959)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6dhWEFPFh8Bq6v-tWFHnC.png?height=1608&width=636)\n\nMatamask小狐狸钱包的主界面点击 发送 按钮就会出现以上画面\n\n分别输入合约地址, 0数额, 刚才取得的十六进制数据, 然后点击下一步就可以Mint了.\n\n**补充: 十六进位数据Mint有三种, 上面的是第一种, 直接拿到Input Data去mint**\n\n**第二种是需要把Input data中一部分字符串修改成自己的地址(不代0x).**\n\n感谢 [twitter.com/yuzijun0902](http://twitter.com/yuzijun0902) 和图狗群的 **猫** 提供的信息\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BZR2B3m5bDE6YaE_eltyS.png?height=1724&width=1883)\n\n**第三种Input data是一堆乱码, 无法mint**\n\n\n---\n\n## 关于如何找到金狗\n\n说实话这个是很难的, 如果大家都能确定是金狗, 就都发财了.\n\n但是金狗还是有一定特征的,\n\n**一般可以看看总供应量, 供应量少的概率大一些.**\n\n**可以看看社区, 推特的关注量, Discord的公告, 很多项目因为进入了熊市就把原定付费Mint的改成了免费Mint, 例如凯撒猿, 魔女pass卡等等.**\n\n以后我会在机器人里追加一些相关信息, 例如**NFT的供应量**, **推特的关注人数**之类的信息, 还有接下来的\\*\\*自动Mint,\\*\\*都会去开发.\n\n**而且还会提供微信推送服务.**\n\n**如果你们打到金狗, 吃水不忘挖井人, 可以给我打个赏.**\n\n**打赏之后别忘记推特上私信联系我, 以后如果有收费项目,或是微信推送服务,

{"id": "PyueYoODCk4dGEIaaaSIgelSdQAroxJAwGfMxyyaRe8", "title": "UI Feedback", "body": "As a frequent user and a manager of a snapshot space from a small community, I’m very pleased to see my previous suggestions are being realized gradually by the amazing team and how snapshot keeps contributing to the success of DAO governance.\n\nFrom the times I can tell, it’s getting better and better in its **optimized creation flow**, **new** **quick access sidebars**, **notification dropdown**, **enhanced hovertips** and my favorite **personal profile** feature showing one’s voting history that I’ve never expected to launch this soon!\n\nI want to write this feedback as a follow-up of what I’ve submitted earlier this year before, from the voice of a long-term user, and also from my community members, sincerely wish these ideas will get snapshot better in the coming future.🌟\n\n\n---\n\n### 1. Add a voting status in the proposals page\n\nThe counter in the right corner of a space shows the number of proposals that have recently entered into the active state, so I guess it’s not possible to make them disappear once a voter casts all the existing votes.\n\nHowever, is it possible to doing a workaround by adding a voter’s voting record at the bottom of **an active proposal item**, just like the “majority choice“ of a closed proposal, indicating that the user has voted this proposal. It can simply be a similar version of what’s inside the proposals votes list.\n\nIt will be of a great help since we often encounter situations where we have to load a series of proposals at consecutive intervals, and members may forget to pick each one of them or double vote on the same proposal since they can’t just remember each of their voting behavior in such situations. By enabling this improvents, people won’t need to click in to check their status, this helps much in governance efficiency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DC62Iu5BytfCmRcjGa5P0.png?height=369&width=835)\n\n### 2. Default starting time to “Now” when duplicating a proposal\n\nIn most cases, we don’t duplicate a proposal simply because of a typo or something like that. Rather, it’s when we find a mistake in our strategy or the proposal doesn’t meet our quorum due to special reasons, we have to do so since once the proposal is posted, it becomes immutable and we can’t revoke it.\n\nMost importantly, the snapshot of the proposal is based on the creation time of itself, not the starting time we set. It doesn’t make a lot of sense that the duplicated proposal still inherits the previous one, especially a very old one with which date we will just **post a closed state** **of proposal** at the current time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6u5JQMRNfqZutZ_lc2Uc.png?height=173&width=758)\n\n### 3. Unify the interaction dynamics on the creation process\n\nIt’s a typical thing mentioned by our authors, that sometimes they just cannot find the “Back“ button to navigate to the last page.\n\nWe found out that most likely it’s because of **the inconsistency** of the backward logic.\n\nThe current creation process is split into 2 pages: the main body of proposal, and the Choice form. While the interface has a different logic in these 2 consecutive pages, it can create kind of loss in user’s consciousness.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we should **add the “←Back“ button** to each of the creation page to bridge that inconsistency.\n\n![Inconsistency: Proposal Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0DX2Kw1zvXa3zZIu9cvTa.png?height=180&width=1253)\n\n![Inconsistency: Choice Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyODQDIYrVLQE9ycTV0Xm.png?height=203&width=1228)\n\n### 4. Integrate notification bells into one within the app\n\nI noticed that Snapshot now has a full list of notification methods we can choose from: HAL, discord bot, epns, webhooks… The notification bell within the space page seems a little outdated, and our members are often confused at what these two bells represent for respectively.\n\nIt spent me a while to get to understand that they actually control different ways of notification, but this also creates a sort of fragmentation within UI. Imagining one wants to turn off notification messages from a specific space he joins in the upper right dropdown list, there’s no way to do so, and the bell below the space name won’t work either, but to switch to another notifiation type.\n\nIMHO, we can make this page much neater by **integrating** the left notication bell with the newer one, and after that it will only point to one type of notification where user can actually control to accept a specific range of space messages.\n\n![two similar bells](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ujtOy7j3fj90TsTHabvT.png?height=426&width=1355)\n\n### 5. Highlight voting types\n\nPastachiodao is a very good example that I use it every time when I try to teach new members who are going to cast their fist votes.\n\nBut sometimes when new members flood in, it’s inevitable someone doesn’t fully comprehend the meaning of the voting system or just neglect the voting type the proposal is using since it’s just placed in the upper right corner of the page.\n\nI’m thinking of a way just like what Pastachiodao did. But differently I want the ‘‘demo’’ directly embedded within a proposal in the simple form like **a short explained hint**, to remind the users which voting type they are acting on, to let them know they can actually choose one more options in an “approval voting” type. I can’t help thinking it because it would be a great attempt to further ‘‘educate’’ our users the knowledge of snapshot in a very practical way.\n\nIt can be in the choice form section **beside ‘“cast your vote“**, indicating a voting type.\n\n![a hint beside \"Cast your vote\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6N3uMa5G1q-rVr39Sqzt.png?height=421&width=790)\n\n### 6. Make visible the bottom bar in the homepage\n\nThe bottom bar provides essential information like official contact, display mode, language setting and official tutorials.\n\nThese elements are highly useful and should be **available at anytime** at least in the homepage. (experience from other well-known projects)\n\nHowever, if one hits the “load more” button, it just keeps loading down forever until all spaces will show up, and the bottom bar containing these information just keep **“blipping“** on each loading. One has to refresh the page to get it back to the original state.\n\nTo keep the bottom bar at a certain visibility level, I can think of 3 options:\n\n1. Pin the bottom bar like “freeze panes” in an excel, so loading will not break its existence.\n2. Add a load limit, like 50 spaces/load, after that, one has to retrigger the load manually.\n3. Keep it as it was. But after one hits the “load more” button and the load starts looping, one will be able to return back the state by hitting “snapshot“ in the top bar or “⚡“ in the sidebar.\n\n![Blip on each \"load more\"...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fTeNuFG5QZzzfxItSeGXw.png?height=219&width=1273)\n\n### 7.  Optimize the experience of edit box\n\nWe usually tweak our strategies in the UI, its original edit box. But the experience is not good, especially for a long code, every time an input will **bring the whole page to the top**, again and again, it brings us headache since we just **lost** where we were in the middle of job. I believe the issue also happens in any edit box like a plugin modal, or the playground…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DokWdmd9oj0EsZkKiZ7k.png?height=680&width=562)\n\n### 8. Strategy reuse\n\nFor different proposal types, we have different strategies to apply.\n\nWe know snapshot doesn’t allow the author to choose arbitrary strategies at his will. We successfully manage it at the admin level, to centralize the use of strategies.\n\nBut as such, we’re also considering for a DAO which has a pool of 10 strategies (and we use it on rotation like 3-4 strategies a time), if we can make things more efficient by keeping those **strategies temporarily not in use** in an “**inactive state”** rather than just deleting them and re-adding them back when it comes to use again?\n\nTherefore we don’t bother to write them again and can bring them back with just a click, which provides much more flexibility.\n\n![Adding a disable button besides delete?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0E6joStNfYGl_uYNbV-Zp.png?height=402&width=771)\n\n### 9. Preserve the input state of the keywords on strategies section\n\nThe number of snapshot’s strategies is exploding, which is good! However sometimes we can hardly tell the exact function of a strategy by its name and have to click in and run a test one by one.\n\nIt’s somewhat inconvenient when we click the return button, and it brings us to the whole list of strategy after we find out it’s not our strategy, we have to **input the keywords  again** to filter to the target lists.\n\nI wish the app can remember the state of our input keywords when we return to the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LWmGGniXeLhjlpBO-Pid6.png?height=290&width=1306)\n\nThanks for reading all the way through, hereby I give my best wishes to snapshot’s future as well as my community！❤", "timestamp": 1653370209, "digest": "XUFYktLBZvMnbNVihV84Iq0xq0hafZ_Rl8FbbO8uIKc", "contributor": "0x4F777E46C37fc4a2f70FdFB3a0A7C56C93EE82F0"}
{"id": "T0jjknvkEIzve3ZkFkSd3swjIftWmnkxOjk3_wDVYH0", "title": "Understanding the foundations of DeFi", "body": "DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance. Right now, you probably use TradFi or traditional financial systems (AKA Centralized finance/CeFi or Legacy Finance) to do things with your money. Storing your funds in a checking account with a bank, using a card to access that money, and taking out loans are all services offered by TradFi banking institutions. DeFi is a new paradigm in managing money via internet protocols and giving people all over the world access to financial services.\n\nDeFi uses Cryptocurrency and Blockchain technologies. The Blockchain keeps everything secure and makes sure the only person that can access your money is YOU. If you’ve never heard the word blockchain or you’re still learning more about it, then check out my upcoming piece: What is the Blockchain, and how the heck does it work?\n\nTo make it easy to understand the differences between DeFi and TradFi, let’s use some examples.\n\nI have a friend in the US, Naomi, and she has a friend in Finland, Johan. Naomi is sending Johan money because he designed a cool graphic for her to use on her business logo. Using TradFi, Naomi would have to send money from her bank to his bank using an international transfer. Her bank charges a percentage of the amount sent as a fee to perform this transaction and tells her that the transfer will take 5 business days to go through. Naomi does it because she needs to send Johan money for the awesome work he did. She is sad that she had to pay the fee and that it takes so long, but she doesn’t know of another way to reliably send money across the world.\n\nEnter DeFi. With DeFi, Naomi can use her Ethereum Cryptocurrency wallet to transfer as much money to Johan as she would like (*the Ethereum blockchain uses Ether/ETH as its native currency*), and it arrives in his wallet within minutes because it is all done over the internet. She doesn’t have to wait 5 days, she doesn’t have to rely on the banks because it’s all done with computer code, and they are both sure that the transaction was completed thanks to the consensus of the Ethereum Blockchain!\n\nThis is a huge improvement when it comes to transferring value from one person to another. Let’s look at another example of what DeFi can do.\n\nNaomi wants to invest more money into her business to help it grow. She has a house, 100 shares in a major tech company, and 50 ETH, but she doesn’t want to sell any of those because she believes they will all continue to grow in value over time. She really wants to grow her business, so she decides to take out a loan and use her assets to secure it. She goes to her bank on a weekday during banking hours and waits in line to speak with a banker that can help her complete the paperwork. She fills out a loan application and uses her house as collateral. After waiting 3 business days she finally receives confirmation that her application was accepted with an APR of 9%, and the loan will be deposited into her checking account after 2 more business days. She wished she didn’t have to wait so long and go through so much hassle to get the loan, but she really wants to invest more in her business, and this is the only option.\n\nEnter DeFi. With DeFi, Naomi can go to a lending protocol and deposit her ETH as collateral in the lending pool. With her ETH in the protocol, she earns an APR for as long as it’s held there. With her ETH deposited as collateral, she can also take out a loan. She chooses the amount she would like to borrow based on how much ETH she deposited (up to 65-75% of the value of her ETH usually) and confirms the loan. Within minutes, she has the loan amount deposited in her Crypto wallet. No waiting in line, scheduling a long lunch to get to the bank during business hours, or paperwork required.\n\nPerforming this process in DeFi is far easier and less time consuming than it is in TradFi. That’s why DeFi is quickly becoming used by people across the world. There is a much smaller barrier to entry than TradFi because all you need is an internet connection. DeFi has started to show that though TradFi is powerful, it has become too large, too deeply rooted within the nation-states (AKA countries) in which it is used, and very inefficient.\n\nNow, this is not intended to disparage these systems, because they have all been integral in the growth of society and its ability to bring incredible innovations to the people of the world. The purpose here is to highlight why these systems have become less effective, and the need for a revolution that allows financial services to experience the exponential innovation that the internet has already brought to countless other industries.\n\nTradFi is built on top of the central banks of the world. When a nation-state wants to issue its own currency to the people that live within its borders, they need a way to control the release and management of this money. So, many of them create a central bank to be responsible for all of this. That government and central bank then start to make rules and standards for how this money is to operate. For a long time, this worked well for most nation-states. They had their currency, governed it how they liked, chose what it can and can’t do, and most people who lived there never needed to do things that the banks had not yet made possible.\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, the world became much more accessible to the average person, and people were doing things that founding central bankers never dreamed would be possible. Then, the internet was born, which eventually lead to the breakthrough of digital scarcity (which is the ability for something to be 100% digital but also have provable scarcity with the blockchain i.e., cryptocurrencies).\n\nNow, we have all this amazing technological innovation pushing society forward, but we still use TradFi services where banks fax paper copies of documents and must wait for people to be working in the office for a transfer to post to your account. There wasn’t a better system for a long time, but now there is.\n\nThis is why we need DeFi. Take Naomi from earlier: there are so many more amazing things that she can do with DeFi that make her current bank account look like a dusty old typewriter. We didn’t even scratch the surface with those 2 examples. This technology is revolutionizing how people access financial services. It’s a worldwide ecosystem that doesn’t exclude anyone, no matter how much money they have or if banking companies are present where they live in the world.\n\nDeFi is changing how we approach finance, and we’ve only covered the basics here, but I hope you’ve started to understand what DeFi is and why it can change how the world uses money. Here’s to bringing global financial infrastructure into the 21st century!", "timestamp": 1653370202, "digest": "aGDteGMARQhs4LDd71YOc_W7-jALWRiEOcV7nxBb1f0", "contributor": "0x2487fC7E019860AFbfC7Fb16689e421843c777E2"}

{"id": "9-iUiS0fc1E8HyKpc7nOrMQQFae4Hw1PbweG0wa99_w", "title": "UI Feedback", "body": "As a frequent user and a manager of a snapshot space from a small community, I’m very pleased to see my previous suggestions are being realized gradually by the amazing team❤️ and how snapshot keeps contributing to the success of DAO governance!\n\nFrom the times I can tell, it’s getting better and better in its **optimized creation flow**, **new** **quick access sidebars**, **notification dropdown**, **enhanced hovertips** and my favorite **personal profile** feature showing one’s voting history that I’ve never expected to launch this soon!\n\nI want to write this feedback as a follow-up of what I’ve submitted earlier this year before, from the voice of a long-term user, and also from my community members, sincerely wish these ideas will help snapshot go better in the coming future.🌟\n\n\n---\n\n### 1. Add a voting status in the proposals page\n\nThe counter in the right corner of a space shows the number of proposals that have recently entered into the active state, so I guess it’s not possible to make them disappear once a voter casts all the existing votes.\n\nHowever, is it possible to doing a workaround by adding a voter’s voting record at the bottom of **an active proposal item**, just like the “majority choice“ of a closed proposal, indicating that the user has voted this proposal. It can simply be a similar version of what’s inside the proposals votes list.\n\nIt will be of a great help since we often encounter situations where we have to load a series of proposals at consecutive intervals, and members may forget to pick each one of them or double vote on the same proposal since they can’t just remember each of their voting behavior in such situations. By enabling this improvents, people won’t need to click in to check their status, this helps much in governance efficiency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DC62Iu5BytfCmRcjGa5P0.png?height=369&width=835)\n\n### 2. Default starting time to “Now” when duplicating a proposal\n\nIn most cases, we don’t duplicate a proposal simply because of a typo or something like that. Rather, it’s when we find a mistake in our strategy or the proposal doesn’t meet our quorum due to special reasons, we have to do so since once the proposal is posted, it becomes immutable and we can’t revoke it.\n\nMost importantly, the snapshot of the proposal is based on the creation time of itself, not the starting time we set. It doesn’t make a lot of sense that the duplicated proposal still inherits the previous one, especially a very old one with which date we will just **post a closed state** **of proposal** at the current time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6u5JQMRNfqZutZ_lc2Uc.png?height=173&width=758)\n\n### 3. Unify the interaction dynamics on the creation process\n\nIt’s a typical thing mentioned by our authors, that sometimes they just cannot find the “Back“ button to navigate to the last page.\n\nWe found out that most likely it’s because of **the inconsistency** of the backward logic.\n\nThe current creation process is split into 2 pages: the main body of proposal, and the Choice form. While the interface has a different logic in these 2 consecutive pages, it can create kind of loss in user’s consciousness.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we should **add the “←Back“ button** to each of the creation page to bridge that inconsistency.\n\n![Inconsistency: Proposal Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0DX2Kw1zvXa3zZIu9cvTa.png?height=180&width=1253)\n\n![Inconsistency: Choice Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyODQDIYrVLQE9ycTV0Xm.png?height=203&width=1228)\n\n### 4. Integrate notification bells into one within the app\n\nI noticed that Snapshot now has a full list of notification methods we can choose from: HAL, discord bot, epns, webhooks… The notification bell within the space page seems a little outdated, and our members are often confused at what these two bells represent for respectively.\n\nIt spent me a while to get to understand that they actually control different ways of notification, but this also creates a sort of fragmentation within UI. Imagining one wants to turn off notification messages from a specific space he joins in the upper right dropdown list, there’s no way to do so, and the bell below the space name won’t work either, but to switch to another notifiation type.\n\nIMHO, we can make this page much neater by **integrating** the left notication bell with the newer one, and after that it will only point to one type of notification where user can actually control to accept a specific range of space messages.\n\n![two similar bells](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ujtOy7j3fj90TsTHabvT.png?height=426&width=1355)\n\n### 5. Highlight voting types\n\nPastachiodao is a very good example that I use it every time when I try to teach new members who are going to cast their fist votes.\n\nBut sometimes when new members flood in, it’s inevitable someone doesn’t fully comprehend the meaning of the voting system or just neglect the voting type the proposal is using since it’s just placed in the upper right corner of the page.\n\nI’m thinking of a way just like what Pastachiodao did. But differently I want the ‘‘demo’’ directly embedded within a proposal in the simple form like **a short explained hint**, to remind the users which voting type they are acting on, to let them know they can actually choose one more options in an “approval voting” type. I can’t help thinking it because it would be a great attempt to further ‘‘educate’’ our users the knowledge of snapshot in a very practical way.\n\nIt can be in the choice form section **beside ‘“cast your vote“**, indicating a voting type.\n\n![a hint beside \"Cast your vote\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6N3uMa5G1q-rVr39Sqzt.png?height=421&width=790)\n\n### 6. Make visible the bottom bar in the homepage\n\nThe bottom bar provides essential information like official contact, display mode, language setting and official tutorials.\n\nThese elements are highly useful and should be **available at anytime** at least in the homepage. (experience from other well-known projects)\n\nHowever, if one hits the “load more” button, it just keeps loading down forever until all spaces will show up, and the bottom bar containing these information just keep **“blipping“** on each loading. One has to refresh the page to get it back to the original state.\n\nTo keep the bottom bar at a certain visibility level, I can think of 3 options:\n\n1. Pin the bottom bar like “freeze panes” in an excel, so loading will not break its existence.\n2. Add a load limit, like 50 spaces/load, after that, one has to retrigger the load manually.\n3. Keep it as it was. But after one hits the “load more” button and the load starts looping, one will be able to return back the state by hitting “snapshot“ in the top bar or “⚡“ in the sidebar.\n\n![Blip on each \"load more\"...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fTeNuFG5QZzzfxItSeGXw.png?height=219&width=1273)\n\n### 7.  Optimize the experience of edit box\n\nWe usually tweak our strategies in the UI, its original edit box. But the experience is not good, especially for a long code, every time an input will **bring the whole page to the top**, again and again, it brings us headache since we just **lost** where we were in the middle of job. I believe the issue also happens in any edit box like a plugin modal, or the playground…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DokWdmd9oj0EsZkKiZ7k.png?height=680&width=562)\n\n### 8. Strategy reuse\n\nFor different proposal types, we have different strategies to apply.\n\nWe know snapshot doesn’t allow the author to choose arbitrary strategies at his will. We successfully manage it at the admin level, to centralize the use of strategies.\n\nBut as such, we’re also considering for a DAO which has a pool of 10 strategies (and we use it on rotation like 3-4 strategies a time), if we can make things more efficient by keeping those **strategies temporarily not in use** in an “**inactive state”** rather than just deleting them and re-adding them back when it comes to use again?\n\nTherefore we don’t bother to write them again and can bring them back with just a click, which provides much more flexibility.\n\n![Adding a disable button besides delete?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0E6joStNfYGl_uYNbV-Zp.png?height=402&width=771)\n\n### 9. Preserve the input state of the keywords on strategies section\n\nThe number of snapshot’s strategies is exploding, which is good! However sometimes we can hardly tell the exact function of a strategy by its name and have to click in and run a test one by one.\n\nIt’s somewhat inconvenient when we click the return button, and it brings us to the whole list of strategy after we find out it’s not our strategy, we have to **input the keywords  again** to filter to the target lists.\n\nI wish the app can remember the state of our input keywords when we return to the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LWmGGniXeLhjlpBO-Pid6.png?height=290&width=1306)\n\nThanks for reading all the way through, hereby I give my best wishes to snapshot’s future as well as my community！❤", "timestamp": 1653370372, "digest": "XUFYktLBZvMnbNVihV84Iq0xq0hafZ_Rl8FbbO8uIKc", "contributor": "0x4F777E46C37fc4a2f70FdFB3a0A7C56C93EE82F0"}

{"id": "-0oo_1wy3_6BI27iCrW4y9G-Oq43sHgM2yfzxx3tDM8", "title": "UI Feedback", "body": "As a frequent user and a manager of a snapshot space from a small community, I’m very pleased to see my previous suggestions are being realized gradually by the amazing team and how snapshot keeps contributing to the success of DAO governance.\n\nFrom the times I can tell, it’s getting better and better in its **optimized creation flow**, **new** **quick access sidebars**, **notification dropdown**, **enhanced hovertips** and my favorite **personal profile** feature showing one’s voting history that I’ve never expected to launch this soon!\n\nI want to write this feedback as a follow-up of what I’ve submitted earlier this year before, from the voice of a long-term user, and also from my community members, sincerely wish these ideas will help snapshot go better in the coming future.🌟\n\n\n---\n\n### 1. Add a voting status in the proposals page\n\nThe counter in the right corner of a space shows the number of proposals that have recently entered into the active state, so I guess it’s not possible to make them disappear once a voter casts all the existing votes.\n\nHowever, is it possible to doing a workaround by adding a voter’s voting record at the bottom of **an active proposal item**, just like the “majority choice“ of a closed proposal, indicating that the user has voted this proposal. It can simply be a similar version of what’s inside the proposals votes list.\n\nIt will be of a great help since we often encounter situations where we have to load a series of proposals at consecutive intervals, and members may forget to pick each one of them or double vote on the same proposal since they can’t just remember each of their voting behavior in such situations. By enabling this improvents, people won’t need to click in to check their status, this helps much in governance efficiency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DC62Iu5BytfCmRcjGa5P0.png?height=369&width=835)\n\n### 2. Default starting time to “Now” when duplicating a proposal\n\nIn most cases, we don’t duplicate a proposal simply because of a typo or something like that. Rather, it’s when we find a mistake in our strategy or the proposal doesn’t meet our quorum due to special reasons, we have to do so since once the proposal is posted, it becomes immutable and we can’t revoke it.\n\nMost importantly, the snapshot of the proposal is based on the creation time of itself, not the starting time we set. It doesn’t make a lot of sense that the duplicated proposal still inherits the previous one, especially a very old one with which date we will just **post a closed state** **of proposal** at the current time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6u5JQMRNfqZutZ_lc2Uc.png?height=173&width=758)\n\n### 3. Unify the interaction dynamics on the creation process\n\nIt’s a typical thing mentioned by our authors, that sometimes they just cannot find the “Back“ button to navigate to the last page.\n\nWe found out that most likely it’s because of **the inconsistency** of the backward logic.\n\nThe current creation process is split into 2 pages: the main body of proposal, and the Choice form. While the interface has a different logic in these 2 consecutive pages, it can create kind of loss in user’s consciousness.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we should **add the “←Back“ button** to each of the creation page to bridge that inconsistency.\n\n![Inconsistency: Proposal Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0DX2Kw1zvXa3zZIu9cvTa.png?height=180&width=1253)\n\n![Inconsistency: Choice Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyODQDIYrVLQE9ycTV0Xm.png?height=203&width=1228)\n\n### 4. Integrate notification bells into one within the app\n\nI noticed that Snapshot now has a full list of notification methods we can choose from: HAL, discord bot, epns, webhooks… The notification bell within the space page seems a little outdated, and our members are often confused at what these two bells represent for respectively.\n\nIt spent me a while to get to understand that they actually control different ways of notification, but this also creates a sort of fragmentation within UI. Imagining one wants to turn off notification messages from a specific space he joins in the upper right dropdown list, there’s no way to do so, and the bell below the space name won’t work either, but to switch to another notifiation type.\n\nIMHO, we can make this page much neater by **integrating** the left notication bell with the newer one, and after that it will only point to one type of notification where user can actually control to accept a specific range of space messages.\n\n![two similar bells](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ujtOy7j3fj90TsTHabvT.png?height=426&width=1355)\n\n### 5. Highlight voting types\n\nPastachiodao is a very good example that I use it every time when I try to teach new members who are going to cast their fist votes.\n\nBut sometimes when new members flood in, it’s inevitable someone doesn’t fully comprehend the meaning of the voting system or just neglect the voting type the proposal is using since it’s just placed in the upper right corner of the page.\n\nI’m thinking of a way just like what Pastachiodao did. But differently I want the ‘‘demo’’ directly embedded within a proposal in the simple form like **a short explained hint**, to remind the users which voting type they are acting on, to let them know they can actually choose one more options in an “approval voting” type. I can’t help thinking it because it would be a great attempt to further ‘‘educate’’ our users the knowledge of snapshot in a very practical way.\n\nIt can be in the choice form section **beside ‘“cast your vote“**, indicating a voting type.\n\n![a hint beside \"Cast your vote\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6N3uMa5G1q-rVr39Sqzt.png?height=421&width=790)\n\n### 6. Make visible the bottom bar in the homepage\n\nThe bottom bar provides essential information like official contact, display mode, language setting and official tutorials.\n\nThese elements are highly useful and should be **available at anytime** at least in the homepage. (experience from other well-known projects)\n\nHowever, if one hits the “load more” button, it just keeps loading down forever until all spaces will show up, and the bottom bar containing these information just keep **“blipping“** on each loading. One has to refresh the page to get it back to the original state.\n\nTo keep the bottom bar at a certain visibility level, I can think of 3 options:\n\n1. Pin the bottom bar like “freeze panes” in an excel, so loading will not break its existence.\n2. Add a load limit, like 50 spaces/load, after that, one has to retrigger the load manually.\n3. Keep it as it was. But after one hits the “load more” button and the load starts looping, one will be able to return back the state by hitting “snapshot“ in the top bar or “⚡“ in the sidebar.\n\n![Blip on each \"load more\"...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fTeNuFG5QZzzfxItSeGXw.png?height=219&width=1273)\n\n### 7.  Optimize the experience of edit box\n\nWe usually tweak our strategies in the UI, its original edit box. But the experience is not good, especially for a long code, every time an input will **bring the whole page to the top**, again and again, it brings us headache since we just **lost** where we were in the middle of job. I believe the issue also happens in any edit box like a plugin modal, or the playground…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DokWdmd9oj0EsZkKiZ7k.png?height=680&width=562)\n\n### 8. Strategy reuse\n\nFor different proposal types, we have different strategies to apply.\n\nWe know snapshot doesn’t allow the author to choose arbitrary strategies at his will. We successfully manage it at the admin level, to centralize the use of strategies.\n\nBut as such, we’re also considering for a DAO which has a pool of 10 strategies (and we use it on rotation like 3-4 strategies a time), if we can make things more efficient by keeping those **strategies temporarily not in use** in an “**inactive state”** rather than just deleting them and re-adding them back when it comes to use again?\n\nTherefore we don’t bother to write them again and can bring them back with just a click, which provides much more flexibility.\n\n![Adding a disable button besides delete?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0E6joStNfYGl_uYNbV-Zp.png?height=402&width=771)\n\n### 9. Preserve the input state of the keywords on strategies section\n\nThe number of snapshot’s strategies is exploding, which is good! However sometimes we can hardly tell the exact function of a strategy by its name and have to click in and run a test one by one.\n\nIt’s somewhat inconvenient when we click the return button, and it brings us to the whole list of strategy after we find out it’s not our strategy, we have to **input the keywords  again** to filter to the target lists.\n\nI wish the app can remember the state of our input keywords when we return to the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LWmGGniXeLhjlpBO-Pid6.png?height=290&width=1306)\n\nThanks for reading all the way through, hereby I give my best wishes to snapshot’s future as well as my community！❤", "timestamp": 1653371756, "digest": "XUFYktLBZvMnbNVihV84Iq0xq0hafZ_Rl8FbbO8uIKc", "contributor": "0x4F777E46C37fc4a2f70FdFB3a0A7C56C93EE82F0"}

{"id": "hXN4TG_HppwVVO2vPUpT5DlN-HrjG5pmvD7qVOriZYY", "title": "UI Feedback", "body": "As a frequent user and a manager of a snapshot space from a small community, I’m very pleased to see my previous suggestions are being realized gradually by the amazing team and how snapshot keeps contributing to the success of DAO governance.\n\nFrom the times I can tell, it’s getting better and better in its **optimized creation flow**, **new** **quick access sidebars**, **notification dropdown**, **enhanced hovertips** and my favorite **personal profile** feature showing one’s voting history that I’ve never expected to launch this soon!\n\nI want to write this feedback as a follow-up of what I’ve submitted earlier this year before, from the voice of a long-term user, and also from my community members, sincerely wish these ideas will help snapshot go better in the coming future.🌟\n\n\n---\n\n### 1. Add a voting status in the proposals page\n\nThe counter in the right corner of a space shows the number of proposals that have recently entered into the active state, so I guess it’s not possible to make them disappear once a voter casts all the existing votes.\n\nHowever, is it possible to doing a workaround by adding a voter’s voting record at the bottom of **an active proposal item**, just like the “majority choice“ of a closed proposal, indicating that the user has voted this proposal. It can simply be a similar version of what’s inside the proposals votes list.\n\nIt will be of a great help since we often encounter situations where we have to load a series of proposals at consecutive intervals, and members may forget to pick each one of them or double vote on the same proposal since they can’t just remember each of their voting behavior in such situations. By enabling this improvents, people won’t need to click in to check their status, this helps much in governance efficiency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DC62Iu5BytfCmRcjGa5P0.png?height=369&width=835)\n\n### 2. Default starting time to “Now” when duplicating a proposal\n\nIn most cases, we don’t duplicate a proposal simply because of a typo or something like that. Rather, it’s when we find a mistake in our strategy or the proposal doesn’t meet our quorum due to special reasons, we have to do so since once the proposal is posted, it becomes immutable and we can’t revoke it.\n\nMost importantly, the snapshot of the proposal is based on the creation time of itself, not the starting time we set. It doesn’t make a lot of sense that the duplicated proposal still inherits the previous one, especially a very old one with which date we will just **post a closed state** **of proposal** at the current time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6u5JQMRNfqZutZ_lc2Uc.png?height=173&width=758)\n\n### 3. Unify the interaction dynamics on the creation process\n\nIt’s a typical thing mentioned by our authors, that sometimes they just cannot find the “Back“ button to navigate to the last page.\n\nWe found out that most likely it’s because of **the inconsistency** of the backward logic.\n\nThe current creation process is split into 2 pages: the main body of proposal, and the Choice form. While the interface has a different logic in these 2 consecutive pages, it can create kind of loss in user’s consciousness.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we should **add the “←Back“ button** to each of the creation page to bridge that inconsistency.\n\n![Inconsistency: Proposal Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0DX2Kw1zvXa3zZIu9cvTa.png?height=180&width=1253)\n\n![Inconsistency: Choice Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyODQDIYrVLQE9ycTV0Xm.png?height=203&width=1228)\n\n### 4. Integrate notification bells into one within the app\n\nI noticed that Snapshot now has a full list of notification methods we can choose from: HAL, discord bot, epns, webhooks… The notification bell within the space page seems a little outdated, and our members are often confused at what these two bells represent for respectively.\n\nIt spent me a while to get to understand that they actually control different ways of notification, but this also creates a sort of fragmentation within UI. Imagining one wants to turn off notification messages from a specific space he joins in the upper right dropdown list, there’s no way to do so, and the bell below the space name won’t work either, but to switch to another notifiation type.\n\nIMHO, we can make this page much neater by **integrating** the left notication bell with the newer one, and after that it will only point to one type of notification where user can actually control to accept a specific range of space messages.\n\n![two similar bells](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ujtOy7j3fj90TsTHabvT.png?height=426&width=1355)\n\n### 5. Highlight voting types\n\nPastachiodao is a very good example that I use it every time when I try to teach new members who are going to cast their fist votes.\n\nBut sometimes when new members flood in, it’s inevitable someone doesn’t fully comprehend the meaning of the voting system or just neglect the voting type the proposal is using since it’s just placed in the upper right corner of the page.\n\nI’m thinking of a way just like what Pastachiodao did. But differently I want the ‘‘demo’’ directly embedded within a proposal in the simple form like **a short explained hint**, to remind the users which voting type they are acting on, to let them know they can actually choose one more options in an “approval voting” type. I can’t help thinking it because it would be a great attempt to further ‘‘educate’’ our users the knowledge of snapshot in a very practical way.\n\nIt can be in the choice form section **beside ‘“cast your vote“**, indicating a voting type.\n\n![a hint beside \"Cast your vote\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6N3uMa5G1q-rVr39Sqzt.png?height=421&width=790)\n\n### 6. Make visible the bottom bar in the homepage\n\nThe bottom bar provides essential information like official contact, display mode, language setting and official tutorials.\n\nThese elements are highly useful and should be **available at anytime** at least in the homepage. (experience from other well-known projects)\n\nHowever, if one hits the “load more” button, it just keeps loading down forever until all spaces will show up, and the bottom bar containing these information just keep **“blipping“** on each loading. One has to refresh the page to get it back to the original state.\n\nTo keep the bottom bar at a certain visibility level, I can think of 3 options:\n\n1. Pin the bottom bar like “freeze panes” in an excel, so loading will not break its existence.\n2. Add a load limit, like 50 spaces/load, after that, one has to retrigger the load manually.\n3. Keep it as it was. But after one hits the “load more” button and the load starts looping, one will be able to return back the state by hitting “snapshot“ in the top bar or “⚡“ in the sidebar.\n\n![Blip on each \"load more\"...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fTeNuFG5QZzzfxItSeGXw.png?height=219&width=1273)\n\n### 7.  Optimize the experience of edit box\n\nWe usually tweak our strategies in the UI, its original edit box. But the experience is not good, especially for a long code, every time an input will **bring the whole page to the top**, again and again, it brings us headache since we just **lost** where we were in the middle of job. I believe the issue also happens in any edit box like a plugin modal, or the playground…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DokWdmd9oj0EsZkKiZ7k.png?height=680&width=562)\n\n### 8. Strategy reuse\n\nFor different proposal types, we have different strategies to apply.\n\nWe know snapshot doesn’t allow the author to choose arbitrary strategies at his will. We successfully manage it at the admin level, to centralize the use of strategies.\n\nBut as such, we’re also considering for a DAO which has a pool of 10 strategies (and we use it on rotation like 3-4 strategies a time), if we can make things more efficient by keeping those **strategies temporarily not in use** in an “**inactive state”** rather than just deleting them and re-adding them back when it comes to use again?\n\nTherefore we don’t bother to write them again and can bring them back with just a click, which provides much more flexibility.\n\n![Adding a disable button besides delete?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0E6joStNfYGl_uYNbV-Zp.png?height=402&width=771)\n\n### 9. Preserve the input state of the keywords on strategies section\n\nThe number of snapshot’s strategies is exploding, which is good! However sometimes we can hardly tell the exact function of a strategy by its name and have to click in and run a test one by one.\n\nIt’s somewhat inconvenient when we click the return button, and it brings us to the whole list of strategy after we find out it’s not our strategy, we have to **input the keywords  again** to filter to the target lists.\n\nI wish the app can remember the state of our input keywords when we return to the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LWmGGniXeLhjlpBO-Pid6.png?height=290&width=1306)\n\nThanks for reading all the way through, hereby I give my best wishes to snapshot’s future as well as my community！❤", "timestamp": 1653372043, "digest": "XUFYktLBZvMnbNVihV84Iq0xq0hafZ_Rl8FbbO8uIKc", "contributor": "0x4F777E46C37fc4a2f70FdFB3a0A7C56C93EE82F0"}

天取回来，完成交互，它上面还有两个产品可以交互，杠杆种植农业但是损失可能比较大，会随着币价波动带来不确定性，谨慎参与，另一个封装期权产品可以参与，损失相对较少，根据自己的情况接下来可以选择性交互[friktion](https://app.friktion.fi/income%EF%BC%89)，需要兑换成SOL（大的风险来自于SOL价格下跌）和7天的锁仓期，很早之前写过这个项目的详细解读教程，如果想参与可以在mirror上找来看看，完成这些项目交互，为了减少损失，我们选择把USDC转移回币安交易所，再次进行其他项目交互，**一定要选择币安交易所的SOL链钱包地址转回**\n\n再次以同样的方式从交易所转账USDC到BSC链（为了多交互跨链桥，当然也可以直接转账到Polygon链），通过上面的跨链桥（如果这两个跨链桥交互资金和次数满意了可以选择其他未发币跨链桥转移）转移到Polygon链，准备把代币转移进ZKsync.\n\n通过[slingshot](https://app.slingshot.finance/%EF%BC%89)或者[clipper](https://clipper.exchange/app/swap%EF%BC%89)交易平台把USDC兑换成WETH，交易损失也比较小\n\n转移代币WETH到ZKsync通过跨链桥[orbiter.finance](https://www.orbiter.finance/%EF%BC%89)（由Polygon链转到zksync）整个花费4，5刀左右\n\n转移完成后通过zksync平台可以看到转移过来的代币，这里需要强调一下，我们最好能够在GAS费低的时候，通过zksync自己的跨链桥从ETH主网转移代币到平台上，花费大概15-20刀左右，跨链完成。这是官方指定的几种跨链方式都可以做一做，zksync大概两个月前就在推特发过这个项目要发币的一些蛛丝马迹，跟着过来大概知道，所以早期埋伏很重要。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Et-sAecYc_poVPM0A4VMT.png?height=553&width=1136)\n\n然后通过[zigzag](https://trade.zigzag.exchange/?market=ETH-USDC&network=zksync%EF%BC%89)交易平台把WETH兑换成USDC，需要留存一点WETH作为汽油费，交互完成（凑够足量的资金多次交互）\n\n在这个新项目[tevaera.com](https://tevaera.com)完成mint早期NFT，花费基本忽略。\n这是这个项目的mint教程，比较简单\n\n[https://tevaera.medium.com/minting-tevaera-citizen-id-nft-e8fe88f11484](https://tevaera.medium.com/minting-tevaera-citizen-id-nft-e8fe88f11484)\n\n13，Argent钱包交互操作教程找了一个已经制作的好的作参考\n\n[https://medium.com/@jianshubiji/%E7%A9%BA%E6%8A%95%E5%9F%8B%E4%BC%8F-argent%E9%92%B1%E5%8C%85%E4%BA%A4%E4%BA%92%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B-6017e3806f5e](https://medium.com/@jianshubiji/%E7%A9%BA%E6%8A%95%E5%9F%8B%E4%BC%8F-argent%E9%92%B1%E5%8C%85%E4%BA%A4%E4%BA%92%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B-6017e3806f5e)\n\n还是要在此声明一下：这绝对不是任何投资建议，能不能做请根据自己的能力酌情考虑，花费资金就会涉及到风险，注意分寸为好\n\n**如果你喜欢我制作的内容，请关注推特[（twitter.com/maik2hello](https://twitter.com/maik2hello%EF%BC%89)）了解掌握更多币圈值得关注的项目和信息。**\n\n币圈超实用工具包合集共18个部分置顶推特，有需要可收藏\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MKYZ7oHTmP9CVbeGoIjDZ.png?height=609&width=908)\n\n",

如果你一直关注我: [twitter.com/zlexdl](http://twitter.com/zlexdl) ,一直学习的话, 我觉得你很轻松就能找到答案.\n\n在我发的 <<使用RSS筛选币圈有用的信息>>文章中, 教会你了如何掌握币圈的大量信息.\n\n只要简单的搜索一下关键词就能轻松找到答案, 可惜没几个人这么做吧.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/zlexdl.eth/CZR_mSfTNm0vfPdx1YDTi0zaM-X1vxeURz_f8078RrM](https://mirror.xyz/zlexdl.eth/CZR_mSfTNm0vfPdx1YDTi0zaM-X1vxeURz_f8078RrM)\n\n\n---\n\n**言归正传, 说一下如何mint, mint 有三种途径.**\n\n### 第一种: 使用官方直接mint\n\n这一种,我想大家都会吧, 如果不会的话, 那就退圈吧.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HQdjDvA1Du1dtMThePZwt.png?height=1524&width=1126)\n\n链接Metamask小狐狸, 直接点击mint按钮,如果没有售空, 并且没有限制的话,就可以mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E3qFRSXE8Ap9fkFgqbOAg.png?height=1030&width=1422)\n\n**注意:很多合约是前多少名额是免费Mint的, 这样的我的机器人也会检测出来, 不要到时候来问我为什么不是免费的你还要发呢.**\n\n\n---\n\n### 第二种: 利用合约Mint\n\n有一些人就问我, 为啥机器人发的一些mint信息没有Website啊?\n\n因为这些图狗根本就没准备Website, 都是为了捞一波就跑的.\n\n这种情况就需要我们进行合约Mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zE-C75sLppsbc1UszgHWX.png?height=1734&width=1127)\n\n点击Etherscan后的链接之后就会看到以下画面.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lw9EXCrebONr8jduejln5.png?height=1632&width=2066)\n\n每个合约都不太一样, 如果你懂开发的话, 可以去 点击Code 按钮去看看代码,\n\n当然如果你开发的话, 你就不用看这篇文章了.\n\n具体Mint 步骤\n\n**1. 点击Connect to Web3 按钮去连接Metamask小狐狸钱包.**\n\n成功之后是这样的:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oQejgwHZdYiTedqC8psX.png?height=405&width=783)\n\n**2.一般方法区都会有Mint ,FreeMint, MintTo, publicMint或是其他带有mint的方法.**\n\n点击 1.FreeMint之后, 可以看到以下画面.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TpoC9xQupn5nNSKxCWctV.png?height=499&width=504)\n\n因为是免费Mint ,所以单价输入框要输入0, 数量输入你喜欢的, 但是这个经常会有限制, 有的是每个地址只能mint一个, 有的是每个地址只能mint10个, 每个合约都不太一样.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qaGBxKfjvAMsOV-orEUQ1.png?height=581&width=676)\n\n**3. 输入好之后点击Write按钮就可以mint了, 如果符合各种条件就会成功的.**\n\n但是当出现以下画面时就放弃吧, 如果你钱多可以给直接发给我.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PHnHgNn18ej8y-fasJ2pP.png?height=382&width=500)\n\n另外: 当你不知道哪个方法是可以mint的呢, 例如以下这个合约的方法, 找不出合适的mint方法\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rApKQ1jIsYFX6eUQAxB4R.png?height=1136&width=515)\n\n你就可以Transactions页面看看其他人都用什么方法.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NwaW7wyn2S7EDhhQd96LR.png?height=905&width=976)\n\n然后会再回到刚才的方法页面去试试, 就可以了.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/W0E0AJLSe_b2uyFnlJ3Wq.png?height=1038&width=1068)\n\n\n---\n\n### 第三种: 跟单Mint\n\n跟单Mint也叫十六进位数据Mint.\n\n就是使用其他人已经Mint的Input Data(十六进位数据)去mint.\n\n**准备工作:**\n\nMetamask小狐狸的【设置】-【高级】-【显示十六进制数据】点击成**启用**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wlvdOsj43Wwli2VQiUVcj.png?height=909&width=551)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gUbOTu_AQy_yFWtZwnBUz.png?height=903&width=553)\n\n在第二种方法已经说了, 先去Transactions页面去看其他人的传输记录.\n\n**去Transactions页面找到近期已经成功Mint并且Value为0的传输, 点击进去**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gywPQUMMi9tLclSPx62_c.png?height=960&width=2068)\n\n可以看出这个记录mint了4个, 那么你如果使用他Input data也会mint4个的, 这点需要注意.\n\n当然也不是没有办法修改的, 但是需要时间, 等你改完了就来不及了, 反正都是免费的.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BXLchbA72CX-RPHJCGja3.png?height=1682&width=1606)\n\n点击上图中左下角的 **Click to see More** 按钮后, 点击**View Input AS**后选择**Original**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/siHeRkhE72bAxmK2KvMHj.png?height=1047&width=1466)\n\n复制红框中的字符串\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3YG3HbQhlReGP53Thr1eB.png?height=396&width=1571)\n\n一定是项目合约地址，不是项目方地址, 千万别选错了,要不然就浪费gas了.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pKWxTzKQP1E-r-OmGj317.png?height=858&width=1357)\n\n这个也是合约地址.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y6gl5P0YYuqc4K5LuKwNx.png?height=154&width=959)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6dhWEFPFh8Bq6v-tWFHnC.png?height=1608&width=636)\n\nMatamask小狐狸钱包的主界面点击 发送 按钮就会出现以上画面\n\n分别输入合约地址, 0数额, 刚才取得的十六进制数据, 然后点击下一步就可以Mint了.\n\n**补充: 十六进位数据Mint有三种, 上面的是第一种, 直接拿到Input Data去mint**\n\n**第二种是需要把Input data中一部分字符串修改成自己的地址(不代0x).**\n\n感谢 [twitter.com/yuzijun0902](http://twitter.com/yuzijun0902) 和图狗群的 **猫** 提供的信息\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BZR2B3m5bDE6YaE_eltyS.png?height=1724&width=1883)\n\n**第三种Input data是一堆乱码, 无法mint**\n\n\n---\n\n## 关于如何找到金狗\n\n说实话这个是很难的, 如果大家都能确定是金狗, 就都发财了.\n\n但是金狗还是有一定特征的,\n\n**一般可以看看总供应量, 供应量少的概率大一些.**\n\n**可以看看社区, 推特的关注量, Discord的公告, 很多项目因为进入了熊市就把原定付费Mint的改成了免费Mint, 例如凯撒猿,

　　宁崎拖着旅行箱走到出站口，便看到人群中陶东来正一脸兴奋地高高举着双手朝自己挥舞着。宁崎嘴角浮出一丝微笑，也举起手朝对方示意了一下。 \n  \n 　　“老同学，可把你等来了！”陶东来一把握住了宁崎的手，那热情的劲头让宁崎感觉似乎又回到了十年前的大学时光。 \n  \n 　　宁崎和陶东来是大学同班同学，又是一个寝室的室友，大学四年里关系铁得可以穿一条裤子。但大学毕业之后陶东来居然去参军当了三年兵，然后南下创业搞房地产，自己当起了老板，宁崎则选择了留校一边当老师一边考研读博的高级知识分子修炼之路，两人碰面的机会就少了许多。不过最近这几年陶东来生意越做越大，腰包也鼓起来了，于是主动做东每两年一次在广州举办一次同学会，吃喝玩乐全包，作为好朋友的宁崎自然当仁不让每次都要从武汉飞过来捧场。 \n  \n 　　两人关系好归好，但陶东来这个大忙人今天会亲自跑到机场来接自己，这是宁崎没有料想到的，记得前几次来广州的时候，陶东来都因为工作原因无法脱身，只安排了秘书之类的办事人员到机场接机。这个小细节起先并没有引起宁崎的注意，等到出了机场上车，陶东来并没有像以往那样带着专职司机，而是自己坐到了驾驶座，宁崎才发现今天似乎真的有些不寻常。 \n  \n 　　“今天你的司机和秘书是商量好一起罢工了？”宁崎一边系上安全带一边开玩笑问道。 \n  \n 　　“那倒不是，是因为有些事我想和你单独谈谈，不希望有外人在场。”陶东来脸上的神情却是没有半点开玩笑的样子。 \n  \n 　　宁崎点了点头，并没有再追问下去。作为多年的朋友他很了解陶东来的性格，如果陶东来说某件事“需要谈谈”，那么就说明这件事情绝不是可有可无的小事。 \n  \n 　　沉默了良久，宁崎才开口道：“所以这次你把我叫过来的原因应该也不是你在电话里说的那样，为了筹备今年的同学会吧？” \n  \n 　　“今年没有时间开同学会了，下半年我要做的事情太多。”陶东来并没有否认自己玩的小花样，侧头看了看宁崎的脸色并无不快，又接了一句：“或许你下半年也会跟我一起忙。” \n  \n 　　“你这是打算要挖我到你公司做事？”宁崎哑然失笑道：“虽然我们在大学是学的工商管理专业，但你应该知道我的兴趣和你不一样，我对做生意真是一窍不通。” \n  \n 　　“我当然知道你对做生意没兴趣，你这个伪明粉，兴趣都在研究历史嘛！放心吧，我让你千里迢迢的飞到广州来，不会勉强你去做你没兴趣的事情。” \n  \n 　　宁崎眼神一亮：“你是在拍卖会买到什么好东西了？还是你那房地产公司修房子挖到古墓了？” \n  \n 　　这下陶东来却是卖起了关子，对此避而不答，转而询问起了宁崎的近况。宁崎虽然有些无奈，但转念一想反正陶东来应该有求于自己，也不可能一直隐瞒下去。 \n  \n 　　陶东来在广州四季酒店已经帮宁崎定好了房间，两人到了之后办完手续进到房间，宁崎一屁股坐到沙发上，急不可待地说道：“好了，到底什么事，你就赶快从实招来吧！” \n  \n 　　陶东来却并没有急着开口，从手包里掏出烟盒，抽了一支递给宁崎，宁崎摇摇手道：“戒了。” \n  \n 　　“又没成家，好端端的戒烟干嘛……”陶东来嘀咕了一句，收回来自己点上了，吸了两口之后才继续说道：“宁崎，我叫你到广州来，是有些东西想让你亲眼看看。但我希望你能给我一个承诺，就是不管你看到之后有什么样的想法，都绝对不要把你的所见所闻说出去，任何人都不行！” \n  \n 　　“说得这么严重，你不会是做了什么犯法的事情吧？”宁崎一脸狐疑地问道。 \n  \n 　　“瞧你这点胆子，还跟以前读书的时候一样，这么多年一点长进都没有！”陶东来见宁崎不搭话，只好应道：“放心吧，不是犯法的事情。但这事真的不宜公开，等你看了之后自然就明白了。” \n  \n 　　“那什么时候看？”宁崎见陶东来这么遮遮掩掩的，反而更是激起了好奇心。 \n  \n 　　“不用急，今晚就带你去。”陶东来站起身道：“行了，你先休息一会儿，晚一点我来接你吃晚饭，顺便介绍几位朋友给你认识。” \n  \n 　　“你这是要组队下副本的节奏啊！”宁崎忍不住开了句玩笑。 \n  \n 　　已经走到门口的陶东来回过头来笑了笑：“你说的没错，就是去下副本。” \n  \n 　　晚饭时分陶东来到房间接了宁崎，直接坐电梯到了酒店71层的愉粤轩，进到包房之后，宁崎发现已经有三名男子入座了。陶东来一边招呼宁崎挨着自己坐下，一边给几人互相介绍了身份。 \n  \n 　　坐在陶东来右边平头黑肤的壮男叫颜楚杰，内蒙人，陶东来当兵的时候是一个班的战友，前年才转业回到地方上，现在是某个国营大厂的保卫处处长，话不多看起来很稳重的样子。 \n  \n 　　颜楚杰旁边带着黑框眼镜，白白净净一副文艺青年形象的男子叫白克思，乍一听有点像老外。白克思和陶东来据说有多年的生意合作，自己经营着一间小型金属加工厂和一间家具厂，另外还在做外贸进出口代理业务。这家伙另外还有一个网络写手的身份倒是让宁崎微微吃了一惊，实在不明白他打理生意之余还哪来的精力写小说娱乐大众。 \n  \n 　　最后一个坐在白克思和宁崎中间的男子看外表要年轻一些，这人宁崎倒是见过，是陶东来的表弟顾凯。大学时宁崎到陶东来老家去玩过，当时这个顾凯还在读初中，一转眼也已经是三十来岁的人了。陶东来介绍说顾凯去了美国读大学，毕业之后就留在那边发展了，目前在旧金山当律师。 \n  \n 　　“人到齐了，上菜吧！”陶东来一挥手，示意服务员开席。 \n  \n 　　几个人一边吃一边闲聊着，宁崎注意到陶东来并没有点酒，其他几人似乎对此也没有任何异议。从交谈之中看得出这几人之前已经见过不止一次了，但他们所谈的话题却并没提及陶东来下午所说的事情。 \n  \n 　　菜过五味之后，白克思对宁崎问道：“宁先生，我听陶老板说你业余时间很喜欢研究历史，依你之见，如果一个人穿越去了几百年前的古时候，最需要什么样的技能才能出人头地？” \n  \n 　　宁崎先是觉得有些奇怪，然后想到对方的网络写手身份就释然了，想必这家伙在网上写穿越小说才会琢磨这种匪夷所思的事情吧。出于礼貌，宁崎还是认真地作了回答：“恕我直言，如果一个现代人穿越到几百年前，能出人头地的几率是很小的。现代人所掌握的专业技能和知识，其实在古时候能用得上的并不多，更大的可能会因为奇思怪谈被人当作神经病，或者是慢慢被当时的社会所同化掉。我认为如果没有比较实用的求生技能，去到那个时代很可能连一个月都熬不过去。” \n  \n 　　“那也未必吧！”提出反对意见的不是白克思，而是那个一直没怎么开口的颜楚杰：“我在部队里干了十多年，亲手带过的兵少说也有好几千了，每天除了吃饭睡觉就是研究军事，要论带兵打仗的本事，怎么也比几百年前见识有限的古人强吧？我要是去了几百年前，当个参将甚至总兵肯定是没问题的。到时候我练一支强军出来，只靠排队枪毙战术就能打遍天下。” \n  \n 　　“颜先生，我很相信你的军事素质，但如果把你放在几百年前，想练出一支强军可不是那么容易的事情。别的先不说，就说当时的人一天只能吃两顿饭，这身体的素质就没办法适应大运动量的操练，要解决吃饭问题你就得先解决后勤供应，吃不饱饭还强行练兵的后果很可能就是哗变。另外军械的提供也是一大难题，要对使用冷兵器的军队取得压倒性优势，我们都知道必须使用火器，我相信你对枪械很熟悉，但你自己会制造火器吗？就算你懂得枪械制造原理，那也需要冶金、金属加工和化工技术的配套行业非常完善才行。军队的实力是国力的体现，以几百年前的生产力水平而言，不太可能支撑起一支现代化的军队。”宁崎谈得兴起，忍不住噼里啪啦对颜楚杰展开了一番反驳。 \n  \n 　　颜楚杰闻言还想分辩几句，白克思却是抢在了前面：“那宁先生觉得要怎样做才能保证现代人回到古时候能有一个相对比较安全的发展基础，然后运用自己的知识去改变当时的社会？” \n  \n 　　“至少……要在尽可能短的时间内建立起近代的工业体系才行，只有生产力的\\*\\*\\*才能改变社会。”这次宁崎沉吟了一阵才答了出来，但旋即又摇头否定了自己的说法：“这个假设不太可能办到，一个人的学识是有限的，单枪匹马根本无法建设一个工业体系，何况近代工业还得要有电力的保障，穿越者有可能凭借自己掌握超越时代的知识成为那个时空的法拉第，但即便伟大如法拉第，从发现电磁感应到世界上建成第一家发电厂，这中间也用了足足四十四年时间，我们哪怕能把这个时间缩短到一半，那也同样难以接受。当然你如果真的相信小说里那样依靠简陋的水力机械就可以钻枪膛炮膛甚至大规模生产军火，那我也无话可说。” \n  \n 　　陶东来很适时地替宁崎的发言作了总结：“也就是说，单枪匹马的穿越到古时候基本没可能拥有改变社会的力量，我这样理解对吧？” \n  \n 　　宁崎点了点头道：“除非是直接穿成了皇帝，全天下都得围着自己屁股转。要不就得带上一支规模庞大的技术支持团队，还有足以保障起步阶段能够顺利运转的物资。” \n  \n 　　宁崎说完之后注意到其他四人默默地交换了一下眼色，似乎在无声之间达成了某种默契。随后话题便转到了各自的私生活上，宁崎很惊讶地发现在座的五人居然全是单身汉，颜楚杰和宁崎自己是还没有结婚的中年男，而陶东来跟白克思则是各自已经离过一次婚，顾凯倒是有个感情稳定的美国女友，但家里长辈似乎对于他打算找个大洋马当老婆的做法颇有些不认同。但陶东来为什么要将这样几个人从五湖四海召集到一起在这里碰面，到目前为止宁崎依然是毫无头绪。 \n  \n 　　饭后其他三人便告辞离去，而陶东来则是陪同宁崎回到房间，宁崎发现床上多了一个旅行包出来。 \n  \n 　　“是我让人送来的，等下我们要去的地方环境不是太方便，包里是鞋和衣服，你先换好。我还有点事情要处理，十二点我来接你出发。”陶东来说完也不等宁崎多问便离开了。 \n  \n 　　宁崎打开旅行包，见是一套columbia的冲锋服和登山鞋，不禁有些疑惑：“难道等下大半夜的还要去爬山？” \n  \n 　　宁崎揣着一脑门子问题等到了十二点，陶东来果然按时来了，而且也换上了全套的户外行头，宁崎只带了手机和房门卡便跟着陶东来出发了。到了停车场宁崎发现今天一起吃晚饭的三个家伙已经在一辆大切诺基上等着了，同样也是换了行头，看样子一切都是早有安排。虽然心中有些疑惑，但既来之则安之，宁崎这时候肯定不可能再打退堂鼓说不去，便爽快地上车没有再多问什么。 \n  \n 　　宁崎来过广州很多次了，所以黑夜之中仍是能够分辨方向，见车居然一路开到了越秀山，果然应了自己先前的猜测。但这越秀山只有一些人文景观，这大半夜上山有什么可看的？ \n  \n 　　车停在了越秀山体育场外面，下车之后，人高马大的颜楚杰从后备箱取出一个鼓鼓囊囊的大登山包背在背上，然后几人鱼贯向山上行去。 \n  \n 　　在经过镇海楼的时候陶东来出声问道：“宁崎，你记得这里吧？” \n  \n 　　宁崎应道：“当然记得，我第一次来广州玩的时候，你知道我喜欢明史，特地带我来这里看过。” \n  \n 　　镇海楼是广州的标志建筑之一，始建于明代洪武年间，历史上经历过多次损毁和重建，现在的镇海楼是1929年改建的，这栋五层古楼除了是著名的人文景观之外，同时也是广州博物馆的所在。 \n  \n 　　绕过镇海楼之后前行了几百米，队伍在陶东来的带领下居然步入了一处没有道路的密林之中。陶东来倒是早有准备，强光手电照射在地上，几人在树丛中又走了两分钟，已经远离了山间步道，陶东来才示意队伍停下。颜楚杰打开登山包取出里面的东西开始在地上铺开，陶东来把手电往宁崎手里一塞，与白克思和顾凯都蹲下身去帮忙，宁崎借着手电的光线一看，发现居然是一顶不小的帐篷，难道这几人还打算在越秀山上露营不成？ \n  \n 　　帐篷很快搭好，在陶东来的带头之下，五个人都进到了帐篷里，颜楚杰又从包里摸出一个led帐篷灯挂上接通电源。宁崎发现其他几人的脸色都很严肃，一点没有野外露营的轻松气氛。 \n  \n 　　陶东来压低了声音对宁崎道：“现在开始，无论你看到了什么，请一定保持冷静，不要大声说话，不要用手电到处乱照，一切行动听我指挥，有问题吗？” \n  \n 　　宁崎已经不知道自己该说什么了，只是呆呆地点了点头。 \n

Additionally, how do you think feminine aesthetics are interpreted in crypto?\n\n问：\n\n在一个男性主导的市场和行业中，你的大部分艺术作品都是超女性化的。除了激励更多有抱负的女性参与创作，拓宽大众对聚焦女性的艺术接受度， BitchCoin 是如何作为先驱，让下一代可以去跟随、学习，改变大范围的目光聚焦？艺术家在这里的作用是什么？此外，你认为女性美学在加密货币中是如何被诠释的？\n\n答：\n\n我认为艺术家的角色不一定要有某种目的性，不一定要成为一个活动家。我想要创造一些作品，能够在理性、情感、视觉上触动你。说来简单，但现实困难重重。我不想只传递一种信息，告诉大家“ BitchCoin 是给女性赋能的，这是我们的信条”。那样大家就都是只把视觉添加到艺术上的活动家而已。但艺术远不止这些。艺术可以更复杂，更黑暗，更混乱，甚至它可以是错的。所以，你不需要无时无刻高举社会事业的大旗，你可以行动起来去解决一些问题。这就是艺术的作用。女性美学，在当下的加密货币世界中并不“流行”。现在更多的是“游戏”美学，这显然很不女性化。我不觉得这是一种歧视，我觉得这是进化过程中很自然的一部分。 NFT 源自于加密货币和游戏，而加密货币和游戏是非常男性化的。\n\n作为女性，我不是在游戏中长大的。但我懂点技术，与此同时，我还是一个投资人，所以自然而然被加密货币所吸引。但这当中肯定有超越性别偏见的东西，因为它已经被极度扭曲到一个失去理性的极致。我们必须找到一种新的方式而不只是单纯的投机，才能让女性更多地参与进来。\n\n\n---\n\n问：\n\n你谈到并写到了艺术和价值概念之间的相互作用。在这种评估下，你提到了黄金和艺术品的估值过程之间的共同点—这两种珍贵（但不是无价）的商品是演进的、独特和稀有的，它们的价值是根据历史重要性和需求来判断的。 NFT 是风险资产，由加密货币社区驱动。作为一种资产， NFT 与加密货币有什么可比性？在加密货币世界，艺术家是如何围绕他们的名字、作品和品牌建立价值的？\n\n答：\n\n艺术和黄金有一个共同点，它们都是文化资产。从根本上说，都是一个锻造的过程，把基础材料转化为更高阶的东西。黄金和艺术家，他们都是没有股利的资产，他们都是纯粹的投机资产，文化上的投机，黄金相对来说还好点。就这一点来说，黄金和加密货币显然是有联系的。 BitchCoin 就是某种数字黄金。所以，对我来说，它们都在同一个泡沫里。NFT很有趣，因为它们与加密货币捆绑在一起，某种程度上来说，其实是和某条链捆绑。现在 BitchCoin 让我和以太坊建立起联系。很有意思，从某种意义上说，它们也是艺术家的 “工作证明”。这就像一个以太坊商店，很有意思。\n\n艺术一直都是一种资产。现在， NFT 让艺术可以即时交易，艺术从未获得过这样的流动性。你甚至不需要考虑存储问题，存储已经如同空气般轻便。而且，这个市场不像（传统）拍卖行，每年只有几次拍卖。任何时候，你只要轻轻点击按钮就可以进行买卖。交易如此的顺滑，似乎我们已经打造出一个图像股票市场。有人在下跌时买入，有人得到小道消息提前买入，也有人洗盘交易。人们早已把某些事情比作是内幕交易。种种迹象表明我们已经把这个实际上还只是艺术市场的地方当做股票市场了。\n\n以前，收藏品基本上是爱马仕包，和棒球卡等。这些东西通常都被大型跨国公司严格操控。但现在，任何人都可以拥有藏品。你正常购买的任何商品，不管是一辆车或一件衬衫，当你把它带出商店的那一秒，它的价值已经发生变化了，它贬值了，大多数东西都是如此。\n\n然而， NFT 市场不同，我们必须向人们出售不会立即贬值的东西。这是一个非常有趣的问题。品牌必须处理好这个问题，因为大公司有责任，不能欺骗他们的消费者。如果小孩在制作图片和 NFT ，每个人都觉得有风险。但是，如果品牌商这样做，并且还有一个二级市场供他们发布 NFT ，情况就变了。现在的问题是，如果你开始向你的 NFT 持有者做出一些承诺，让他们觉得你在为他们工作，这就是一种担保。如果我说，我将卖出一些其他的 NFT ，然后用得到的利润回购 BitchCoin ，即使这是我通过努力增加 BitchCoin 的价值。或者我直接把钱空投给我的 NFT 持有人，那也会成为一种担保，因为人们觉得 BitchCoin “在做事”。创造一种需要市场、需要维持价值的资产，同时还不需要担保，这之间的界限非常微妙。\n\n\n---\n\n问：\n\n最后，在这种情况下，一个毫无名气的创作者，创作了一个新的 NFT ，在没有背景和需求的情况下，如何赢得认可并提升作品的价值？\n\n答：\n\n现在， NFT 市场有着和实体艺术世界截然不同的生态系统。他们凝视着对方，试图与对方交谈。但目前为止，我还没有发现他们之间有太多重叠之处。\n\nNFT 的评判标准非常不同。我现在在伦敦有一个展览，展出全息图，它们没办法被电子化记录。它们完全是模拟出来的。除了版本大小之外，没有任何稀有特征。可能你会喜欢它的内容、它的美学，也可能完全不喜欢。如果你是一个不知名的创作者，除了创造和分享作品之外，没有任何捷径。现在还没有作品把关人，但有很多充满好奇心的人（在这个市场），你可以随时随地开始这场探索。\n\n2015 年，那时鲜有人涉足这个市场，某种程度上，基础建设上确实困难重重，但知名度相对容易获得。在首次发行的时候，我们以 100 美元的单价卖出了 200 个 BitchCoin 。今天，各种各样的平台、小组、对谈、会议，你只要参与进来，开始分享就行了。加密货币社区才成立没多久，大家都希望它能成功，所以每个人都非常友好。这是我到目前为止的亲身体验。\n\n\n---\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5yOovR5b5zBeWYimUBLo1.jpeg?height=1320&width=1080)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9eVegV8N928vkPJd6Pj4G.jpeg?height=266&width=716)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653372634, "digest": "2TD_FPlyfnSk0QX2XRsqV8RD_KeVdS3Pta5AlVj2i9o", "contributor": "0x3381BB3B23F14eDcE0F8C22aF12194575392375A"}

{"id": "tzA7HrW46ciOa5k2M_llzmKWhrhwHVXJTYs1_fKCXpc", "title": "UI Feedback", "body": "As a frequent user and a manager of a snapshot space from a small community, I’m very pleased to see my previous suggestions are being realized gradually by the amazing team and how snapshot keeps contributing to the success of DAO governance.\n\nFrom the times I can tell, it’s getting better and better in its **optimized creation flow**, **new** **quick access sidebars**, **notification dropdown**, **enhanced hovertips** and my favorite **personal profile** feature showing one’s voting history that I’ve never expected to launch this soon!\n\nI want to write this feedback as a follow-up of what I’ve submitted earlier this year before, from the voice of a long-term user, and also from my community members, sincerely wish these ideas will help snapshot go better in the coming future.🌟\n\n\n---\n\n### 1. Add a voting status in the proposals page\n\nThe counter in the right corner of a space shows the number of proposals that have recently entered into the active state, so I guess it’s not possible to make them disappear once a voter casts all the existing votes.\n\nHowever, is it possible to doing a workaround by adding a voter’s voting record at the bottom of **an active proposal item**, just like the “majority choice“ of a closed proposal, indicating that the user has voted this proposal. It can simply be a similar version of what’s inside the proposals votes list.\n\nIt will be of a great help since we often encounter situations where we have to load a series of proposals at consecutive intervals, and members may forget to pick each one of them or double vote on the same proposal since they can’t just remember each of their voting behavior in such situations. By enabling this improvents, people won’t need to click in to check their status, this helps much in governance efficiency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DC62Iu5BytfCmRcjGa5P0.png?height=369&width=835)\n\n### 2. Default starting time to “Now” when duplicating a proposal\n\nIn most cases, we don’t duplicate a proposal simply because of a typo or something like that. Rather, it’s when we find a mistake in our strategy or the proposal doesn’t meet our quorum due to special reasons, we have to do so since once the proposal is posted, it becomes immutable and we can’t revoke it.\n\nMost importantly, the snapshot of the proposal is based on the creation time of itself, not the starting time we set. It doesn’t make a lot of sense that the duplicated proposal still inherits the previous one, especially a very old one with which date we will just **post a closed state** **of proposal** at the current time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6u5JQMRNfqZutZ_lc2Uc.png?height=173&width=758)\n\n### 3. Unify the interaction dynamics on the creation process\n\nIt’s a typical thing mentioned by our authors, that sometimes they just cannot find the “Back“ button to navigate to the last page.\n\nWe found out that most likely it’s because of **the inconsistency** of the backward logic.\n\nThe current creation process is split into 2 pages: the main body of proposal, and the Choice form. While the interface has a different logic in these 2 consecutive pages, it can create kind of loss in user’s consciousness.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we should **add the “←Back“ button** to each of the creation page to bridge that inconsistency.\n\n![Inconsistency: Proposal Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0DX2Kw1zvXa3zZIu9cvTa.png?height=180&width=1253)\n\n![Inconsistency: Choice Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyODQDIYrVLQE9ycTV0Xm.png?height=203&width=1228)\n\n### 4. Integrate notification bells into one within the app\n\nI noticed that Snapshot now has a full list of notification methods we can choose from: HAL, discord bot, epns, webhooks… The notification bell within the space page seems a little outdated, and our members are often confused at what these two bells represent for respectively.\n\nIt spent me a while to get to understand that they actually control different ways of notification, but this also creates a sort of fragmentation within UI. Imagining one wants to turn off notification messages from a specific space he joins in the upper right dropdown list, there’s no way to do so, and the bell below the space name won’t work either, but to switch to another notifiation type.\n\nIMHO, we can make this page much neater by **integrating** the left notication bell with the newer one, and after that it will only point to one type of notification where user can actually control to accept a specific range of space messages.\n\n![two similar bells](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ujtOy7j3fj90TsTHabvT.png?height=426&width=1355)\n\n### 5. Highlight voting types\n\nPastachiodao is a very good example that I use it every time when I try to teach new members who are going to cast their fist votes.\n\nBut sometimes when new members flood in, it’s inevitable someone doesn’t fully comprehend the meaning of the voting system or just neglect the voting type the proposal is using since it’s just placed in the upper right corner of the page.\n\nI’m thinking of a way just like what Pastachiodao did. But differently I want the ‘‘demo’’ directly embedded within a proposal in the simple form like **a short explained hint**, to remind the users which voting type they are acting on, to let them know they can actually choose one more options in an “approval voting” type. I can’t help thinking it because it would be a great attempt to further ‘‘educate’’ our users the knowledge of snapshot in a very practical way.\n\nIt can be in the choice form section **beside ‘“cast your vote“**, indicating a voting type.\n\n![a hint beside \"Cast your vote\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6N3uMa5G1q-rVr39Sqzt.png?height=421&width=790)\n\n### 6. Make visible the bottom bar in the homepage\n\nThe bottom bar provides essential information like official contact, display mode, language setting and official tutorials.\n\nThese elements are highly useful and should be **available at anytime** at least in the homepage. (experience from other well-known projects)\n\nHowever, if one hits the “load more” button, it just keeps loading down forever until all spaces will show up, and the bottom bar containing these information just keep **“blipping“** on each loading. One has to refresh the page to get it back to the original state.\n\nTo keep the bottom bar at a certain visibility level, I can think of 3 options:\n\n1. Pin the bottom bar like “freeze panes” in an excel, so loading will not break its existence.\n2. Add a load limit, like 50 spaces/load, after that, one has to retrigger the load manually.\n3. Keep it as it was. But after one hits the “load more” button and the load starts looping, one will be able to return back the state by hitting “snapshot“ in the top bar or “⚡“ in the sidebar.\n\n![Blip on each \"load more\"...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fTeNuFG5QZzzfxItSeGXw.png?height=219&width=1273)\n\n### 7.  Optimize the experience of edit box\n\nWe usually tweak our strategies in the UI, its original edit box. But the experience is not good, especially for a long code, every time an input will **bring the whole page to the top**, again and again, it brings us headache since we just **lost** where we were in the middle of job. I believe the issue also happens in any edit box like a plugin modal, or the playground…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DokWdmd9oj0EsZkKiZ7k.png?height=680&width=562)\n\n### 8. Strategy reuse\n\nFor different proposal types, we have different strategies to apply.\n\nWe know snapshot doesn’t allow the author to choose arbitrary strategies at his will. We successfully manage it at the admin level, to centralize the use of strategies.\n\nBut as such, we’re also considering for a DAO which has a pool of 10 strategies (and we use it on rotation like 3-4 strategies a time), if we can make things more efficient by keeping those **strategies temporarily not in use** in an “**inactive state”** rather than just deleting them and re-adding them back when it comes to use again?\n\nTherefore we don’t bother to write them again and can bring them back with just a click, which provides much more flexibility.\n\n![Adding a disable button besides delete?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0E6joStNfYGl_uYNbV-Zp.png?height=402&width=771)\n\n### 9. Preserve the input state of the keywords on strategies section\n\nThe number of snapshot’s strategies is exploding, which is good! However sometimes we can hardly tell the exact function of a strategy by its name and have to click in and run a test one by one.\n\nIt’s somewhat inconvenient when we click the return button, and it brings us to the whole list of strategy after we find out it’s not our strategy, we have to **input the keywords  again** to filter to the target lists.\n\nI wish the app can remember the state of our input keywords when we return to the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LWmGGniXeLhjlpBO-Pid6.png?height=290&width=1306)\n\nThanks for reading all the way through, hereby I give my best wishes to snapshot’s future as well as my community！❤", "timestamp": 1653372728, "digest": "XUFYktLBZvMnbNVihV84Iq0xq0hafZ_Rl8FbbO8uIKc", "contributor": "0x4F777E46C37fc4a2f70FdFB3a0A7C56C93EE82F0"}

Web3 的世界，有何方式可证明自己曾经历过什么呢？\n\n*作者：Crescent，律动 BlockBeats* \n  \n 毕业证书可以证明我们就读过的院校，奖励证书可以证明我们所获得的荣誉，专业技能证书可以证明自身的工作能力，这一张张的标签串联起来足以刻画出我们的生活轨迹。不止如此，游戏中我们拥有段位证明，工作中我们拥有经历证明，就连刷视频的时候也会被大数据推送符合我们兴趣偏好的内容，背后隐藏着我们的标记证明。 \n 千千万万人生活的轨迹，构成属于我们一串串的数据凭证，不过，这些凭证都被隔离在相对封闭数据库中。我们的学历证明存在于官方机构中，信贷记录存在于金融机构中，在一个 App 中的习惯仅在相关联之处体现。 \n 除了这些存在于我们的日常生活中的场景，在链上我们也需要这样的凭证。当用户在一些借贷项目中（如 AAVE 或 Compound）进行进行抵押贷款且及时归还，未被清算无任何不良记录时，这生成的凭证就记录并证明了该用户的良好信用。其他平台或借款人也可以凭此证明衡量借出款项的额度，风险性等因素。当用户在新项目启动后，有无参与，做过多少贡献，曾有过何种投票历史，用户的所有行为数据都也可以生成凭证，社区即可根据这些凭证按比例奖励贡献者。 \n 不过，当前机构间的封闭性导致这些信息并不对本该拥有这些数据的个人或需要这些数据的应用程序开放，这也造成了当前分裂的局面。 \n Project Galaxy 则想通过建立一个开放的凭证数据网络来帮助用户解决当前问题。 \n  \n **Project Galaxy 在做什么** \n  \n Project Galaxy 想要通过链上、链下两个维度多个数据源搜集凭证数据，进行网络管理。其指出，对于链上凭证，策展人可以提供子图查询或静态快照。在链下，则已与 [http://Snapshot.org](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//Snapshot.org)、Twitter 和 Github 等数据源集成。 \n 通过这些凭证数据，Project Galaxy 构建了一个基于 Web3 DID（Decentralized ID 去中心化身份）系统。像上文所说，我们当前的身份系统是分裂的，不同中心化网站上有不同的身份系统，用户每使用一个新的网站后都需要注册一个账户（如微信、淘宝），随着身份的逐渐增多，给用户带来许多不便。不过演化到现在，许多网站已经可以提供第三方登录，但是我们的身份系统还未统一，也就是说我们不能凭借一个账号，只用一个身份系统，登录所有网站，汇集所有痕迹。 \n  \n **Galaxy ID 代表了什么** \n  \n Project Galaxy 想构建的就是这样一个系统，用户拥有的 Galaxy ID 相当于用户通用的用户名，通过 Galaxy ID 将凭证串联起来，形成一个凭证数据网络。用户将其钱包链接到官网后即可生成 Galaxy ID，在此 ID 上会根据用户的历史行为，自动显示出「Uniswap V3 交易员」、「OpenSea 交易员」等标签，且用户还可通过 Galaxy ID 显示出在 Web3 世界中收集的凭据，如 NFT 徽章，彰显出自身的历史成就。 \n 由用户自己控制自己的身份，可以做到自己进行认证，自己进行授权，而不是由权威机构从中控制。目标类似成为成为链上 LinkedIn。 \n 用户每次与 Galaxy Protocol 交互，都会被收取平台费用，但目前 Beta 测试期间免费。一般情况下用户需要支付 Gas 费才能申领和铸造 NFT，不过 Galaxy 也支持活动发行者代表用户支付交易费用，从而实现无 Gas 铸造。 \n 当凭证用于 Galaxy 的应用程序模块、凭证 Oracle 引擎和凭证 API 时，也就是说数据被用户使用后，也会给予策展人一定的奖励。 \n \n\n \n 开发者可以集成 Galaxy ID 工具包，并根据用户的链上凭证为用户提供定制的功能。目前 Cyberconnect、Unipass 和 Salad Venture 等项目已经在其产品中进行使用。 \n  \n 可通过该平台构建和分发 NFT 徽章 \n  \n Project Galaxy 可以为开发人员提供应用程序模块、凭证 Oracle 引擎和凭证 API，开发人员可以利用凭证数据来构建更好的产品和社区。 \n 简单来说，就是其他项目方可通过 Project Galaxy 的 NFT 基础设施与链上凭证数据网络构建和分发 NFT 徽章，来对社区成员进行管理。官方称之为 Galaxy OAT（链上成就代币），这记录了用户的所有成就。 \n 就如笔者在「[Salad Ventures 项目介绍](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.theblockbeats.info/news/29297)」中提到的，Salad Ventures 就是通过与 Project Galaxy 进行合作，使 Scholar 达到每种成就可以铸造相应的 NFT 徽章，通过 GalaxyID 展示，把其作为 Gamefi 宇宙身份贯穿其整个职业生涯。在这里用户的每一种成就都可被铸造成一枚枚 NFT 徽章。比如在游戏中，用户达到了多少胜率，即可铸造一种徽章，在交易上，铸造作为 Uniswap V3 交易员的徽章，或者在生活中曾购买哪场音乐会门票、参加过什么样的活动，都可以铸造成 NFT 徽章展示出来。Galaxy 表示 Galaxy OAT 是用户一生所有成就的数字记录。 \n 整体创建流程也比较简单，活动组织者只需要提交参数和徽章设计就能创建活动和凭证，供用户参与，所有 OAT NFT 的元数据都将存储在由 IPFS 和 Filecoin 提供支持的 NFT.Storage 上。 \n \n\n \n 官方表示迄今为止，已有 100 多个合作伙伴在 Project Galaxy 上发起了 500 多个活动。 \n  \n 经济模型 \n  \n GAL 为该项目的原生 Token，总量为 2 亿枚。 \n \n\n \n 在其 Token 分配中： \n 生态系统占比：6% \n 前期参与者占比：2% \n CoinList 公募占比：5% \n 第一轮增长支持者占比：10.63% \n 第二轮增长支持者占比：10.14% \n 投资顾问与合作伙伴占比：6.23% \n 市场营销占比：15% \n 基金会占比：10% \n 团队占比：15% \n 社区金库占比：20% \n 下图为其释放路径： \n \n\n \n GAL 不仅可以用于 Galaxy DAO 项目中的投票和治理，还是 Project Galaxy 生态系统的主要支付 Token。比如在治理中，Token 持有者可以控制平台收取的费用以及社区金库的资金。在支付中，开发人员需要使用应用程序模块以及 Galaxy 凭证数据时，以 GAL 作为费用进行支付。大部分费用将归策展人所有，其余部分费用则会收取到社区金库中。开发人员需要通过 Galaxy Oracle Engine 和 Galaxy Credential API 查询我们的凭证数据时，也需要用 GAL 付费。 \n  \n 项目背景 \n  \n Project Galaxy 前段时间宣布完成 1000 万 美元融资，其中有许多知名投资方，由 Multicoin Capital 和 Dragonfly Capital 领投，Spartan Group、Sky9 Capital、Coinbase Ventures、Binance Smart Chain Growth Fund、C-Squared Ventures、Lattice Capital、Mirana Ventures、Folius Ventures、Solana Ventures、Jump Capital、Alameda Research 等参投。资金将用于扩大对多个数据源的支持，继续构建应用模块，发展凭证数据网络。 \n Project Galaxy 由 Harry 与 Charles 联合创立，两者分别在 2016-2017 年以及 2017-2018 年担任过伯克利中国企业家协会 (ACE) 主席。 \n \n\n \n Harry Zhang 是该项目的联合创始人兼项目负责人。Harry 曾做过 Club Factory（当时印度第三大电子商务平台）的数据产品负责人。 \n 步入区块链领域后 Harry 担任过 Lino Network 的联合创始人兼首席运营官，以及 [http://DLive.tv](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//DLive.tv) 的联合创始人，带领团队打造了每月为超过 1000 万活跃用户提供服务的产品。 \n \n\n \n Charles Wayn 是 Project Galaxy 的联合创始人兼战略主管。Charles 曾在 [http://DLive.tv](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//DLive.tv) 担任联合创始人兼首席执行官。在 2019 年 DLive 并入 BitTorrent 后，Charles 成为了 BitTorrent 互动娱乐副总裁，管理包括 [http://DLive.tv](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//DLive.tv)、DLive Protocol 和 Two App 在内的多个流媒体业务部门。 \n  \n 总结 \n  \n 目前该项目支持 Ethereum、Polygon、Fantom、Solana、BNB Chain、Arbitrum 和 Avalanche 七条公链。 \n 这些用户行为数据形成的凭证大有用处，相当于自身的个人简历标记用户着曾获得的成就。对于普通用户来说，可以使他人可通过用户过去的成就更加了解自己。对于开发者来说，除了上文举例的评判信用进行发放贷款、公会凭借凭证招纳人才之外，还可奖励社区贡献者。以及根据用户的具体行为，对用户有一个基础判断，从而准确的定位到目标客户。 \n Web3 凭证数据网络和 DID 系统在区块链开发的项目中并不多见，但是我们还是存在这样的需求。这样一个系统出现，对于开发者或者是用户来说无疑非常方便。 \n 当今的 DID 项目如 Civic、uPort（现在已演变为 Veramo 和 Serto），多注重匿名验证以及安全性，应用场景在物理世界中居多，如为自动售货机进行匿名年龄验证，或对用户进行 KYC 验证等。而 Project Galaxy 带给人的体验多倾向于身份认证与 NFT 的结合，再加上他的许多应用模块，给链上世界提供了一定的基础设施，是开发者可以进行 Galaxy OATs、NFT 忠诚度计划、定制治理等，更适用于社区管理。 \n 使用策展人提供的数据可以使策展人得到回报，在一定程度上激励更多策展人参与，这又会增加 Project Galaxy 的信息覆盖范围，促使其 Web3 凭证数据网络更加强大，吸引更多的开发者使用该网络数据，形成一个正向循环。 \n

The national and international markets are regulated by Governments, while voluntary markets are not. The market is dominated by activity from voluntary standards.\n\nOffset issuance and number of projects registered by mechanism\n\n**Regulated Markets**\n\nThe regulated offset markets consist of domestic crediting regimes as well as multilateral mechanisms (such as the erstwhile [Clean Development Mechanism or CDM](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms-under-the-kyoto-protocol/the-clean-development-mechanism)). The issuance of offsets in domestic trading mechanisms increased by [25% in 2020 (compared to 2019),](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35620) led by the California Compliance Offset Program and the Australia Emissions Reduction Fund. While CDM is being phased out to give way for a new international mechanism.\n\nCDM was a cap-and-trade scheme that was established under the Kyoto Protocol. It allowed governments or private entities in industrialized countries (Annex I) to implement emission saving projects in developing countries (Annex II). This helped the Annex I countries to meet their emission quota while the Annex II countries got the needed finance to kickstart climate friendly projects. At present the provision of a multilateral cap and trade scheme is encapsulated in the Article 6 of the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement). The [COP 26](https://unfccc.int/conference/glasgow-climate-change-conference-october-november-2021) finally saw countries coming together to agree on its implementation.\n\n**Voluntary Markets**\n\nThe share of voluntary carbon projects and offsets is increasing in the overall offset market. **[In 2015, voluntary crediting mechanisms contributed less than 20% to the annual issuances. This number increased to over 50% in 2019](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33809/9781464815867.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y)**. In 2021, [the voluntary carbon markets have already recorded a growth of over 60% over the last year](https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/press-release-voluntary-carbon-markets-rocket-in-2021-on-track-to-break-1b-for-first-time/#:\\~:text=In%20the%20first%20eight%20months,goals%2C%20a%20new%20report%20finds.). This indicates that many more organizations and individuals are resorting to voluntarily offsetting, by using independent crediting mechanisms. To keep up with the 1.5**°**C pathway the global demand for voluntary carbon offsets (resulting from a carbon asset) needs to increase by at least[ 15X by 2030 and 100X by 2050. Or from 100 million offsets in 2020 to at least 1.5–2 bn in 2030.](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/a-blueprint-for-scaling-voluntary-carbon-markets-to-meet-the-climate-challenge)\n\nVoluntary carbon credit demand scenarios (GtCO2e/year)\n\nWithin the voluntary carbon offset markets, the largest share of offsets is issued under the VCS framework of Verra, making these offset types the most liquid and widely traded.\n\n \n PS: This is from the blog I wrote for my venture OffsetFam.

{"id": "Ca9LUxn7XuWB--zBhFSo6YgL7vwprhXq1OEV4aNNIto", "title": "你了解区块链该读的第一篇文章：区块链将如何改变世界？", "body": "想象一下：我们重新回到金本位的世界，然后把每个人拥有的黄金数量都记录在支付宝里，我们买东西和转账都通过这个黄金支付宝来完成，而实物黄金被我们藏在一个谁也找不到的地方。\n\n这就是数字货币试图为我们描述的世界，有一种不依赖国家主权的物品（这里是黄金）充当一般等价物，你会发现其实这个一般等价物是什么并不重要，历史上也出现过白银甚至贝壳充当一般等价物的情况，当然，它也可以是比特币，真正重要的是，这个一般等价物要被大家所接受。\n\n但是数字货币的世界还是有点不同，在数字货币的世界中，并不存在支付宝，而是存在一套系统，它不属于任何人或公司，由多数人共同维护和控制，可以免费的帮我们记录资产和交易，而且从来不会犯错，也无法被攻击。这个系统就是区块链。\n\n## 怎么可能有人接受比特币？\n\n问出这个问题，显然你还没有接受比特币，这并不奇怪，这个世界的大多数人都没有接受比特币，但是当然也有一部分人选择了接受比特币，例如微软公司就接受比特币支付。目前比特币总价值超过了100亿美元，单个比特币的价格在3800元人民币左右。\n\n比特币并不是一夜之间获得现在的接受程度的，事实上从比特币面世到现在经历了近8年的时间，在2010年的时候产生了第一笔比特币交易，当时一个人用一万个比特币买了一个披萨（现在看这可能是有史以来最贵的披萨），所以比特币有一个逐渐被接受的过程，因此正确的问题应该是，到底是什么促进了比特币被接受？\n\n显然世界上最初没有比特币，产生比特币的过程被称为挖矿，你可以把它想象成开采黄金。不过比特币的挖矿是一个比拼算数题的过程，系统会为所有正在挖矿的计算机出一道数学题，谁先做出了这道题，谁就获得了比特币。影响挖矿产出的因素主要是算力，算力越高的机器挖出比特币的概率就越大。\n\n和开采黄金一样，比特币的挖矿也有成本，需要消耗电力和磨损硬件，现在用普通计算机挖矿，消耗的资源大概是挖出比特币价值的十倍，所以想通过挖矿致富的小伙伴可以洗洗睡了。真正专业的矿场多数都建在水电站的旁边，低成本的获得能源，并且会对软硬件进行优化，关于挖矿的更多细节，[可以参考这篇文章](http://www.jpm.cn/article-2296-1.html)。\n\n回到我们的问题，比特币是如何流行的？答案是，不同时期挖矿的效率是不同的，在早期参与挖矿的机器少，竞争也比较少，更容易挖出比特币，当然这个时候比特币并不值钱，早期参与挖矿的也都是一些极客，他们通常都有这样的预期：比特币在未来将会更流行。\n\n**流通本身会带来价值**，在我们开头黄金的例子中，其实我们把黄金藏起来并不影响人们使用电子黄金进行交易，也就是说大家看重的不是黄金的价值，而是其作为价值载体的流通价值。从经济学的角度说，挖矿的供给是相对稳定的，更广泛的流通意味着有更多的人和场景需要比特币，而需求的增加将推升比特币价格。\n\n也就是说，如果你认为比特币会更流行，比特币的价格就存在上涨的预期，于是就会有更多的人参与挖矿，也会有人参与投机，总之会有越来越多的人参与进来，这一过程又促进了比特币价格上涨，形成一个正反馈的循环，比特币的早期参与者也因此获益。\n\n当然真实情况要复杂的多，另外一个重要的因素是，需要不断有人开拓比特币支付的场景，让更多的商家接受比特币支付，这样才能真正促进比特币作为货币的流通，不过其实问题的关键，还是让更多的人了解和接受比特币和数字货币的概念。\n\n## 没有支付宝，数字货币如何被记录？\n\n这里我们需要来解释一下区块链和比特币的关系，上面讲到，比特币挖矿是一个比拼算数学题的过程，在系统的设计中，每当比特币被挖到的时候，同时会产生一个叫做区块的东西，每个区块会记录从上一个区块产生到目前的所有比特币交易。\n\n除此之外，每个区块还有一个头部和尾部，其功能是通过密码学的原理，把相邻的区块连接起来，形成区块链，实现的效果是，如果某个区块的内容被篡改，就会与其相邻的区块产生冲突，进而被发现。\n\n区块链的设计机制是只有最长的链是有效的，假设有一个坏节点希望篡改区块链的内容，它无法改变某个单独的区块，只能争取产生新的假区块，这就需要和全网所有其他节点对抗，所以如果这个节点拥有超过全网50%的运算能力，就能实现对区块链进行控制，专业术语叫做算力攻击。\n\n目前比特币系统已经遍布全球，很难对其进行算力攻击，即使真的有人能做到，付出的成本也大于获得的价值，这就从经济学的角度杜绝了算力攻击。随着比特币网络越来越大，其价值会越来越高，但相应其算力也会越来越高，从而维持了这一平衡。\n\n**事实上区块链是一套去中心化的记账系统**。一般对于记账系统来说，记账行为和数据存储都是中心化的，去中心化记账相当于把账本分别存储在不同的地方，同时又由不同的人来记账，于是如何解决记账一致性的问题就是关键所在。\n\n区块链技术的特别之处，就在于通过竞争记账（算数学题）的方式，巧妙的解决了这一问题。当一个节点算出了数学题，可以迅速的向其他节点进行验证，当足够多的节点承认了这一结果后，系统就会进行确认，这就既避免了需要一个中心化的权威机构来做判断，又防止了恶意节点的操纵。\n\n## 区块链将如何改变世界？\n\n现在终于可以回答我们题目的问题，区块链将如何改变世界？读到这你有没有发现，如果我们接受了基于区块链的数字货币，其实我们就不需要银行了？事实上你也不会听说任何比特币银行。\n\n区块链对银行的替代作用和支付宝对银行的替代作用有相似的地方，我们把钱存在银行，无非出于3个原因：利息、安全、更方便的支付，这些功能支付宝都具备，而区块链具备后两者，不过财富管理带来的收益可以替代利息收益。\n\n无论是支付宝还是银行，都是中心化的记账系统，当我们使用非现金的方式付账的时候，需要有一个权威的记账机构，向商家证明我们的账户里真的有钱，并且帮我们把钱转付给商家。银行作为记账机构的权威性来自国家监管的背书，而我们相信支付宝是因为阿里巴巴的信用和技术能力。\n\n但是这样一个记账中介的存在产生了巨大的成本，想一想银行有多少线下网点，有多少服务人员吧。此外，每个银行都会有自己的 IT 记账系统，用户在支付和转账的时候，就会在银行间形成交易，分别被两个银行记录，这就涉及到对账和结算的问题。\n\n国内的交易还好说，因为有央行作为权威机构，在银行间进行清算，但是国际交易因为没有权威机构作为中介，各国的清算系统和流程又有很大差异，导致交易变得十分麻烦。\n\n区块链的解决方式是去中心化的，所有的交易都被公开的记录在区块链上，这就省去了对账的麻烦，跨国的交易也不需要等到当天银行结算后完成，而是可以实时到账。目前国际清算每笔的成本约26美元，如果区块链得以应用，仅此一项每年节约的费用就在数十甚至上百亿美元。\n\n更进一步来说，整个金融体系就是一个信任体系，原本这一体系是通过国家背书、金融监管的方式建立信任，**而区块链的出现，是用技术的手段解决了信任问题，从而对现有的金融系统提出了一套成本更低的替代解决方案**。\n\n再举一个例子，我们在交易所交易股票需要支付手续费，以覆盖交易所和证券体系运行的成本。但是如果区块链可以记录所有的股票交易，理论上我们也不再需要交易所了。按照A股每天2000亿交易额，平均交易成本万分之五计算，仅仅中国的股票交易，每天将节约成本1亿元。\n\n当一个行业成本结构发生变化的时候，往往会出现剧烈的变革，从这个角度来说，区块链将会重塑金融行业。全球金融行业每年的产值在数万亿美元，任何一个细分领域的应用，都将是一个庞大的市场。\n\n不仅如此，区块链创造的可信任的记账体系还有很多其他应用，例如记录影视、音乐、出版等行业的版权和交易；记录数字资产的发行；记录病史和就医情况，方便医生了解病人情况；记录供应链各个环节的生产，从而实现供应链的溯源，防止假货的产生等等。\n\n区块链向我们展示了一个所有资产都将被数字化的世界，在一个价值的互联网上，资产的转移将像今天信息的传递一样快捷、方便、便宜。不知道写到这里，你是不是还认为我在描述一个未来世界？在这里借用威廉·吉布森的一句话来结尾：未来已来，只是尚未流行。", "timestamp": 1653373849, "digest": "mIiMTR98A6BAXkt9Z0JBmKciz9XTYrPThCrAo3g9RCA", "contributor": "0x91e41069F5300128bbdeed94659A3Fe28499FF1E"}

Mt's will re-define your social relationship graph. Mt's image tells us that when we started to enter the crypto world, many people are the watchers, they were or surprised, or skeptical, or excited, or afraid. However, as an objective rule, the arrival of anything new alway create chaos, some won, some lost, some waited and waited.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0AmbCbCggDrMmh6nH_Zvh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n### Participation\n\nMt's are issued in 12600 pieces. Every Mt's has its unique characteristics and rarity. Mt's will help you realize your social value, allowing you to gain fun and income from your social connections and behavior. Mt's wants to flip the NFT market with new form of energy. NFT shall not be the chips in the hand of the rich, at least that’s not Mt’s. Mt’s owners help each other in a way that no one has ever done.\n\nMt's will issue the first 50 pieces as the seed, half of which will be given as Whitelist to those who have participated and contributed in Mt’s early stages, the other half goes to the first official mint pool where everyone can participate.\n\nTo obtain the first 50 Mt’s are required to go to Mt’s website, log into personal page for the Invitation Code(IC). ICs are the permission to participate mint. Make sure IC in the pocket prior to each mint round.\n\nMt's mint uses an incremental model with an initial price of 0.09 ETH.  Totally 6\\*round mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kiQWX7xPDP5Em54uLfSrV.png?height=1434&width=2794)\n\n## Beyond the PFPs, go ride with mtier.\n\n### Mtier Rank Program\n\nIn order to promote Mt’s influence and build solid relationship among members, Mt’s has its unique incentive program, the Mtier Rank Program(MRP). Once user own Mt’s NFT, he/she becomes a mtier Noob. After completing 2\\*invites and both invitees successful mint Mt’s, mtier Noob go to the rank, the MRP automatically kicks in.\n\nEach mtier has his/her rank(except the Noob), ranks come with different allowances. \n MRP reward is made of two parts: Share reward and Royalties. \n Share reward is an invitation-oriented incentive.\n\n**i.g.** \n Mtier1 invites 2\\*mtier2 and both mtier2 sucessfully mint Mt’s NFT, mtier1 will gain 24% share reward from mtier2’s mint costs.  If mtier2 has his/her own 2\\*mtier3 minted Mt’s NFT, mtier2 will gain 24% share reward from mtier3’s mint costs, meanwhile mtier1 gains 12%  share reward from mtier3’s mint costs.\n\nAlso mtiers will gain 10% of the royalties when their Mt’s NFT in Opensea, etc. \n The specific allowance rate chart shows as following:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5jLNtGnQ7MdFkIxiQH2xx.png?height=1645&width=3761)\n\n### Funds Allocation\n\n**All mint funds will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 50.87% will go to Mtier Rank Program.  \n 24.13% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 25% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**Royalty income will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 2.49% will be awarded to all users holding NFT and participating in the invitation. \n 3% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 4.45% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**The Mt’s Community Treasury:**  \n 20% of the Foundation's funds will be used for acquisitions and marketing. \n 80% will be reserved for bonuses.\n\n\\*When only 5% of total market Mt's NFT are remained, all bonuses will be shared equally.\n\n### Mt's DAO\n\nAll users holding Mt's NFT are members of Mt's DAO. Mt's DAO members can vote in project decisions and can decide how to use bonuses and whether to acquire new NFTs. Mt's DAO will in future be involved and influence the development of Mt's NFT as the core decision maker of Mt's NFT.\n\n### Reward collection\n\nThe mtier who have activated the rewards, can collect them on Mt’s official website. In order to better motivate new comer, Mt's NFT has been reorganized on the collection mechanism-all Mt's NFT that has collected rewards will be automatically destroyed. This deflation mechanism can increase the value of retained Mt 's NFT. After destruction, designated mtier will receive a new vMt's NFT as a credential to record your existing social network.\n\n### vMt's NFT Function\n\nvMt's NFT is a derivative NFT after the original Mt's NFT is destroyed. 20% of vMt's NFT will be used as the seed for the next project and the rest can be redeemed for future CON LAB new projects. Holding vMt's NFT will also continue to maintain your existing social connections, meaning you will continue to increase the value  your social connections. Further more, Holding vMt's NFT will also give you the opportunity to receive token airdrops.\n\n### Mt's redefines NFT\n\n\"The next era will be defined by today's social networking sites and the depth of connection given to users, and our job is to find the best way for users to share themselves\" - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nThe value of relationships is based on the sharing economy, which means sharing one's state of being, one's information, one's interests, one's hobbies. The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing. Mt’s aims to build a perpetual social-fi  generator in Web3.\n\nThe CON LAB will create a decentralized NFT trading platform driven by influencers and the community through a perpetual network of social connections, with the proceeds of each transaction distributed to the platform's NFT holders to enjoy perpetual dividends and a true return of equity to the user.\n\n## What is Mt's\n\nThe Made-it's , The Miss-it's, The My-turn's\n\nThis was a great movement that will eventually be remembered in crypto history. Free from the interference of capitals and authorities. There are no losers in this movement.\n\nThis time we are not a bystander, we are expressing our emotions in a way that will influence more crypto practitioners.\n\nFrom this moment on, Mt's will change the world.\n\n### Follow Mt’s\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MtsNFTs)    |    [Disocrd](https://discord.gg/TK3VCgH4pR)    |    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUahYxfJ2xaB9W9js3ifWQ)\n\n## Don't wait&see, up with Mt’s.", "timestamp": 1653373740, "digest": "vyA5575rvQ7kbqkumCcLLXqMptIBWzFhFzwE4MfQexc", "contributor": "0x5b23A5d907805a4dcFBe13aE232442A6746c5C9C"}

As the contest plays out, a player may gain rewards and other progression-related qualities that can increase the effectiveness of their team.\n\n### Battle Rewards\n\nVictories will offer contestants a chance to win Ore and other possible rewards.\n\n### Tournaments & Battle Stones\n\nPaid Toumaments will be at the heart of Planet Mojo. By using Ore to craft Battle Stones (Tourmament Entry Tickets), players will have the opportunity to enter Tournaments with SMOJ and other rewards as prizes. The Battle Stones will be crafted NFTs, and thus sellable or shareable with others. \n\n### Free VS Owned\n\nPlanet Mojo will include a free to-play path for players who do not own a Mojo or Champions over time. This playmode will have some limits attached but still offer a robust venue for players wanting to test their skills and experience the Mojo Melee gameplay. Free players will be provided with a generic Team:\n\n\\-Limited character selection\n\\-Limited Level Progression\n\\-Ability to get into Tournaments based on certain criteria TBD.\n\n### Player Ranking\n\nThe Mojo Melee Ranking system will sort players based on the Trophies they earn for winning matches. The aim is to categorize players with similar skill and player levels in order to get more equitable contests. Ranking also provides an incentive for players to increase the value of their Battle Team.\n\n## Tokenomics\n\n### Token\n\n**-$MOJ**\n$Moj is the native ERC-20 Token of Planet Mojo. Everything between staking to in-game payments to governance will be used for $MOJ at a discount to the USDC rate of services.\n**-ORE**\nThe in-game utility & reward soft currency that allows players to upgrade their NFTs. Earned in Auto Chess.\n**-BATTLE STONES (NFTs)**\nBattle Stones are passes to get players into paid tournaments.

The Planet Mojo team is extremely honored to share their first INO sale experience with Polkastarter’s phenomenally experienced team and their dedicated and passionate community. Public Pre Sales rewards community loyalty by allowing them to buy a MOJO at discounted prices; before they become available publicly. Check out the project page for the incredible deal we are offering to our early supporters.\n\nMojo holders who have sprouted their Moj-Seeds will be automatically airdropped 4 of the initial 6 Champions randomly ahead of the game’s early release in the summer! To be clear, by minting and holding 1 Mojo, you will be airdropped 4 NFTS for free! You’ll receive 5 NFTs for the price of 1.\n\n## Community\n\nThe game's community is already of a certain size. In terms of the number of followers, 25k Twitter followers and 23k Discord subscribers are enough for the game to gain a firm foothold in the blockchain games, but in terms of engagement of the community, they are relatively inactive, so the game's community is large enough for it to attract some public attention, but it still needs the team to make the community active.\n\n## Team & Investors\n\nMystic Moose is the new company behind Planet Mojo and brings together an experienced group of game development and blockchain veterans from LucasArts, EA, Activision, HappyGiant and more.\n\nMystic Moose announced the closing of $5 million in venture capital and unveiled Planet Mojo.The award-winning Mystic Moose team is made up of gaming industry veterans with over 25 years experience from LucasArts, EA, Activision, and HappyGiant. The seed round is led by Animoca Brands, with participation from Courtside Ventures, Republic Crypto, Alameda, AU21, Sfermion, Polygon Studios, Collab+Currency, Sky Vision Capital, Spartan Capital, HyperEdge, Momentum6, Fourth Revolution Capital, and others. \n\n## Summary\n\nIn general, this is a game we can keep an eye on. Its game model is fresh and creative, which is why its community members have been consistently growing. On the other hand, its diverse economy system and value-added space is more interesting and attractive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oqUJb1f7lkKjDlBPgIZsZ.png?height=151&width=512)\n\n**Author:** **@BitMetis** **| BitReport**\n\nYour Source of Reliable, Unbiased Research and Due Diligence\n\n**BitMetis Review：**\n\n**Gameplay：PvP Auto chess battler game**\n\n**Tokenomics: Diverse Mechanism,**\n\n**NFT：Normal  NFT mechanism, first NFT SALE on May 12, 2022**\n\n**Community：Enough member size but engagement is relatively inactive**\n\n**Investor & Team： Highly qualified team and strong-background investors**\n\n\n---\n\n*Please Note: the above content analysis is for Reference Only, not as a basis for investment decision-making.

Mt's will re-define your social relationship graph. Mt's image tells us that when we started to enter the crypto world, many people are the watchers, they were or surprised, or skeptical, or excited, or afraid. However, as an objective rule, the arrival of anything new alway create chaos, some won, some lost, some waited and waited.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0AmbCbCggDrMmh6nH_Zvh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n### Participation\n\nMt's are issued in 12600 pieces. Every Mt's has its unique characteristics and rarity. Mt's will help you realize your social value, allowing you to gain fun and income from your social connections and behavior. Mt's wants to flip the NFT market with new form of energy. NFT shall not be the chips in the hand of the rich, at least that’s not Mt’s. Mt’s owners help each other in a way that no one has ever done.\n\nMt's will issue the first 50 pieces as the seed, half of which will be given as Whitelist to those who have participated and contributed in Mt’s early stages, the other half goes to the first official mint pool where everyone can participate.\n\nTo obtain the first 50 Mt’s are required to go to Mt’s website, log into personal page for the Invitation Code(IC). ICs are the permission to participate mint. Make sure IC in the pocket prior to each mint round.\n\nMt's mint uses an incremental model with an initial price of 0.09 ETH.  Totally 6\\*round mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kiQWX7xPDP5Em54uLfSrV.png?height=1434&width=2794)\n\n## Beyond the PFPs, go ride with mtier!\n\n### Mtier Rank Program\n\nIn order to promote Mt’s influence and build solid relationship among members, Mt’s has its unique incentive program, the Mtier Rank Program(MRP). Once user own Mt’s NFT, he/she becomes a mtier Noob. After completing 2\\*invites and both invitees successful mint Mt’s, mtier Noob go to the rank, the MRP automatically kicks in.\n\nEach mtier has his/her rank(except the Noob), ranks come with different allowances. \n MRP reward is made of two parts: Share reward and Royalties. \n Share reward is an invitation-oriented incentive.\n\n**i.g.** \n Mtier1 invites 2\\*mtier2 and both mtier2 sucessfully mint Mt’s NFT, mtier1 will gain 24% share reward from mtier2’s mint costs.  If mtier2 has his/her own 2\\*mtier3 minted Mt’s NFT, mtier2 will gain 24% share reward from mtier3’s mint costs, meanwhile mtier1 gains 12%  share reward from mtier3’s mint costs.\n\nAlso mtiers will gain 10% of the royalties when their Mt’s NFT in Opensea, etc. \n The specific allowance rate chart shows as following:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5jLNtGnQ7MdFkIxiQH2xx.png?height=1645&width=3761)\n\n### Funds Allocation\n\n**All mint funds will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 50.87% will go to Mtier Rank Program.  \n 24.13% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 25% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**Royalty income will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 2.49% will be awarded to all users holding NFT and participating in the invitation. \n 3% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 4.45% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**The Mt’s Community Treasury:**  \n 20% of the Foundation's funds will be used for acquisitions and marketing. \n 80% will be reserved for bonuses.\n\n\\*When only 5% of total market Mt's NFT are remained, all bonuses will be shared equally.\n\n### Mt's DAO\n\nAll users holding Mt's NFT are members of Mt's DAO. Mt's DAO members can vote in project decisions and can decide how to use bonuses and whether to acquire new NFTs. Mt's DAO will in future be involved and influence the development of Mt's NFT as the core decision maker of Mt's NFT.\n\n### Reward collection\n\nThe mtier who have activated the rewards, can collect them on Mt’s official website. In order to better motivate new comer, Mt's NFT has been reorganized on the collection mechanism-all Mt's NFT that has collected rewards will be automatically destroyed. This deflation mechanism can increase the value of retained Mt 's NFT. After destruction, designated mtier will receive a new vMt's NFT as a credential to record your existing social network.\n\n### vMt's NFT Function\n\nvMt's NFT is a derivative NFT after the original Mt's NFT is destroyed. 20% of vMt's NFT will be used as the seed for the next project and the rest can be redeemed for future CON LAB new projects. Holding vMt's NFT will also continue to maintain your existing social connections, meaning you will continue to increase the value  your social connections. Further more, Holding vMt's NFT will also give you the opportunity to receive token airdrops.\n\n### Mt's redefines NFT\n\n\"The next era will be defined by today's social networking sites and the depth of connection given to users, and our job is to find the best way for users to share themselves\" - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nThe value of relationships is based on the sharing economy, which means sharing one's state of being, one's information, one's interests, one's hobbies. The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing. Mt’s aims to build a perpetual social-fi  generator in Web3.\n\nThe CON LAB will create a decentralized NFT trading platform driven by influencers and the community through a perpetual network of social connections, with the proceeds of each transaction distributed to the platform's NFT holders to enjoy perpetual dividends and a true return of equity to the user.\n\n## What is Mt's\n\nThe Made-it's , The Miss-it's, The My-turn's\n\nThis was a great movement that will eventually be remembered in crypto history. Free from the interference of capitals and authorities. There are no losers in this movement.\n\nThis time we are not a bystander, we are expressing our emotions in a way that will influence more crypto practitioners.\n\nFrom this moment on, Mt's will change the world.\n\n### Follow Mt’s\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MtsNFTs)    |    [Disocrd](https://discord.gg/TK3VCgH4pR)    |    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUahYxfJ2xaB9W9js3ifWQ)\n\n## Don't wait&see, up with Mt’s.", "timestamp": 1653373839, "digest": "vyA5575rvQ7kbqkumCcLLXqMptIBWzFhFzwE4MfQexc", "contributor": "0x5b23A5d907805a4dcFBe13aE232442A6746c5C9C"}

Factory基础设施的支持。欢迎通过文末方式提交DAO的研究，瓜分10000USDC赏金池！了解去中心化自治组织（DAO），探讨最新治理话题，关注DAO的发展趋势，欢迎加入DAOrayaki社区！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bMHoErgF51zq9hJOhbLWR.png?height=375&width=1080)\n\n# 链下声誉是精英管理的关键\n\nDAO 或去中心化自治组织类似于企业，它通过代币化治理进行投票。如果你想加入一个 DAO，在公开市场上购买某些代币通常是唯一的资格。因为会员资格需要持有代币，所以持有更多代币的个人往往会产生更大的会员影响力，由此 DAO 通常将决策能力集中在其最大的代币持有者身上。\n\n这意味着你拥有的分配治理权的代币越多，你对DAO发展方向的影响越多。如果你更为富有，你将拥有更多的掌舵权，甚至即使再低最有资格的人施加影响的情况下，可能会为更好的决策提供信息，这就被称为DAO的富豪统治问题。\n\n一个富豪是一个精英统治阶级，其权力是从他们的财富的。根据代币持有比例分配投票权的 DAO 是财阀，在购买这些代币时更是如此（例如，与赚取的相反）。根据拥有的资产而不是专业知识来分配决策权，将导致 DAO 保持富豪统治，除非有关成员的合格数据变得更加具体。甚至 Vitalik Buterin最近也承认通过代币持有量分配投票治理权不灵活的缺点，这种方式可能会存在严重的不平等和激励失调，甚至它会导致黑客通过购买投票实现直接攻击。根据最富有的委员会的意见，Web3 不会通过实践设计而出类拔萃，但现在 DAO 缺乏灵活的工具来以自主、去中心化的方式记录声誉和资格。在这个系统中添加另一层——声誉——可以为合格的参与者创造更多空间，并为治理提供更公平的方法。\n\n我们不想将传统金融的富豪领导权换成类似集中的加密货币霸主。今天的 DAO 是美化的技术富豪。这种现实与 web3 的愿景和使命相去甚远；如果我们要实行任人唯贤，就不能依靠财富来分配治理角色。而如果我们现在不处理这个问题，它只会变得更加根深蒂固，难以修正。有一种方法可以解决这个问题：增加一层声誉，以重视财富之外的贡献和能力。此类个人数据需要脱链、动态且可验证，以创建去中心化的声誉。\n\n# DAO 成员可以建立股权和声誉（部分）\n\n随着智能合约为自动执行的业务和金融交易建立了模型，DAO 开始崭露头角。尽管早期的 DAO 模型在安全方面苦苦挣扎，但它们的灵活操作和最近在怀俄明州的政府接受预示着它们在基于任务的项目经济中的作用有前景。\n\nDAO 本身并不要求贡献者有正式的员工安排，而是让他们能够在项目上随意工作，同时获得奖励以换取工作贡献。DAO 提供了一个灵活的业务框架，如代码驱动的合作社，它提供了许多低风险、有偿的机会来获得 web3 生态系统的经验。贡献者不必全职受雇于任何项目，可以远程工作，并且可以从众多项目中获得报酬以换取有用的贡献。DAO 提供了个人贡献者能够获得成果股份的项目结构。当用户友好的工具使贡献者可以轻松分享成果时，自愿性、紧急性甚至是短暂的工作都可以得到认可。正如库珀·特利( Cooper Turley ) 最近在一次会议上所说的那样Bankless 播客上有关 DAO 的小组讨论，“DAO……是流动的。没有团队和用户动态；团队和社区是一体的。这允许人们以更自由流动的方式进入。使用 DAO，您不需要人力资源流程和具有归属时间表的多年合同。你可以加入并从今天开始贡献。”\n\nGitcoin DAO是将社区贡献代币化并将初始代币和治理权仔细分配给异常活跃的贡献成员的一个突出例子。然而，由于影响力的衡量标准（Gitcoin 代币）是可转移和半可替代的（非上下文），即使对于这种“fAirDrop”代币分配策略，DAO 富豪问题的解决仍然遥遥无期。Gitcoin 广泛选择的精英分布式 ——NFT 也受到同样的关注：它们是可交易的、链上的，从长远来看，这两者都使它们成为持久身份和声誉的不良候选人。此外，作为 web3 领域的多产参与者，Gitcoin DAO 的顶级贡献者在其他生态系统中没有任何价值。这真的公平和去中心化吗？幸运的是，Gitcoin团队已经在争取一个身份更为去中心化的未来。\n\n一些团队使用代币的基本经济特征来暗示声誉，例如代币锁定期和基于代币持有时间的加权投票权。例如，Popsicle Finance根据几个符合条件的钱包/代币特征创造性地分配投票权，包括基于代币持有时间的乘数。这些能力标志着区分 DAO 参与者任期的价值。\n\n没有去中心化的身份和声誉，每个 DAO 都必须独立验证每个成员的身份。如果成员资格基于技能和声誉，那么每个 DAO 必须分别集中验证该个人的身份。DAO 通常会接触不良的中心化代理，例如 Twitter。但是如果用户被锁定在他们的帐户之外，或者被影子禁止会发生什么？或者，如果某人的受信任 Twitter 身份是由另一个平台（例如 Discord）上的骗子执行的，那么不知情的用户可能会被骗。\n\nDAO 可能有逐步去中心化的计划，但没有语境身份和声誉的计划从本质上讲只是在重复 Web 2.0 的历史。依靠社交媒体帐户和集中身份代理作为解决方法并不能解决根本问题。\n\n# DAO 不是去中心化或自治的，所以股权是不稳定的\n\nDAO 旨在成为一种没有正式业务结构的、开销轻量级的协调机制。除了风险资本式的投资 DAO 之外，几乎没有任何 DAO 能够有效地实现这一结果，这些 DAO 将成员的资金集中用于集体投资。在ethCC会议上，NEAR Protocol 联合创始人 Illia Polosukhin 将所谓的 DAO 格局描述为“拥有银行账户的 Facebook 群组”——与 DAO 名称所暗示的自主主权相去甚远。甚至更复杂的 DAO 通常相当于由重叠的 web3 爱好者群体填充的代币Gateway Discord 频道。DAO 赋予的 Discord 角色标签作为去中心化声誉的孤立代理，链上交易历史提供了个人能力的狭隘视图。\n\n在投资型 DAO 中，主要活动是确定资本的使用。成员对 DAO 的出资允许他们就如何部署这些资金进行投票。此类 DAO 中的身份由您贡献了多少资本来定义，这是 DAO 成员针对此类追求的相关用户配置文件的范围。当用户都拥有能够就其财富进行交流的身份（例如以太坊地址）时，使用财富或代币持有量作为声誉的代理是有效的。这种方法在 ETH-maxi 未来最有效。鉴于DAO正在朝着强大的跨链生态系统发展，该系统可能不是最公平的。这也是为什么专注于财富分配的 DAO 似乎在技术上是最整合的；所需的会员资格，以及日常的财务参与活动，\n\n# 链上声誉的有限性和危险\n\n2017 年，ERC-735提出了链上凭证文件的提案，包括智能合约层中的数据。ERC-735 不适用于个人身份信息 (PII)，因此仅限于没有敏感数据的实体的身份。这样的提议很快就被取消了，因为链上的 PII 不允许自愿选择性披露和自我主权的身份。类似的提议正在重新出现，例如以太坊证明服务，它利用默认为公开且不可变的链上交易。但是，Serto 团队无法验证证明的存储位置或存在哪些界面供用户管理围绕其披露的同意。\n\n个人身份信息 (PII) 不属于区块链。如果隐私是公开的和不可改变的，那么它就不可能是灵活的、自愿的和不断发展的。将 PII 放在链上向受众公开数据，这些受众的范围比我们现在生活的监控资本主义的 web2.0 生态系统中的受众更为广泛。链上 PII 通常将声誉数据与单个地址相关联，从而限制了您可以轻松轮换密钥或使用与您生活的不同方面相关联的不同地址的程度。GDPR 和 CCPA 等法律与代表用户的公开的、不可更改的个人数据文件存在强烈冲突；根据这些规定，链上 PII 的程序化发布是非法的。出于这些原因，以太坊地址本身并不是灵活的上下文身份的基础（尽管是表示财富的好方法）。\n\nNFT 也是有缺陷的声誉代理，因为它们是链上的、公开的、不可变的，并且可以购买或交易。这凸显了广受喜爱的POAP 代币的一个缺点——这些 NFT 并不能证明 “你”参加了一个活动。它们只证明“某人”参加过，因为 POAP 很容易被赠送、购买或交易（就像所有 NFT 一样，除了不可转让的 NFT）。同样的缺点也适用于基于 NFT 的身份项目和使用 NFT 的基于角色的访问控制。\n\n不可转让的声誉 NFT 会带来更多的复杂性和更大灾难的机会。因为被锁定到了一个地址，因此即使是最认真的不可转让 NFT 也缺乏灵活性。幸运的是，不可转让的 NFT 非常少见，因为如果您的钱包收到包含非法内容的不可转让的 NFT，它将与您的钱包地址不可撤销地关联。拥有与您的地址相关联的不可移动的非法内容可能需要您迁移到一个新地址，并从头开始，留下您在那时累积的任何过去的钱包交易历史记录。\n\n带有非法内容的可转让 NFT 也可能对用户构成危险威胁，用户必须支付油费才能通过燃烧代币（将它们发送到 0x0 地址）来摆脱它们。将许多非法 NFT 发送给不知情的接收者将需要他们花费相应的燃油费用来销毁代币，或者放弃他们的钱包和从新地址开始的链上声誉。选择是明确的：除非您将钱汇入深渊或放弃您的交易历史，否则您将不得不遭受公共声誉的损害，并忍受与您的地址相关的未经同意的非法行为。\n\n将 NFT 用于链上声誉的挑战阐明了卓越的 DAO 原语：具有去中心化标识符 (DID) 和可验证凭证 (VC) 的去信任链外声誉。\n\n# DID 和 VC 是声誉的未来\n\n去中心化标识符 (DID)是由可以轮换的密钥对控制的一串数字和字母。可验证凭据 (VC)是由一个标识符对另一个标识符或某些其他事实或对象进行的证明。这些证明由他们的证明者加密签名，可撤销、链下、私有、可选择性披露并且可以设置为过期。\n\nDID 提供了一种灵活、直接的方式来签署链下证明，并且可以成为可验证凭证的主题。您还可以轻松地将多个社交标识符与 DID 连接起来，例如 Twitter 帐户、网站、Discord、Github——由3Box Profiles开创。与90+ DID方法通常与清晰普遍分解器，的DID是用于管理上下文数据链无关的解决方案。DID 可以将任何区块链的公共地址（或任何其他类型的公共标识符）转换为可以管理自身数据的系统无关标识符。\n\n可验证凭证是 DID 发布的签名数据的有形单位。VC 可以存储在本地，在某些情况下甚至可以在没有互联网访问的情况下进行验证。VC 越来越受欢迎，成为 Apple 医疗记录和 IBM COVID-19 凭证的首选防篡改标准。\n\n# DAO 之间的可移植身份和声誉\n\n**多重签名验证演示**\n\n任何人都不应该能够在 DAO 中做主，因此任何人都不应该能够代表 DAO 发布声誉。DAO 授予的凭证也应获得多方的批准（例如，DAO 成员资格证明或设计贡献证明应由 DAO 中的多方签署）。DAO 可以定义哪些凭证和哪些签名可以一起生成可验证的信誉单元。\n\n可验证的代表制是通过多个签名实现这种声誉证明的一种方式。这些证明要求将一组凭证一起提供以实现验证。例如，DAO 会员徽章可能采用可验证的展示形式，其中来自 DAO 成员的多个 VC 都证明了您的会员资格（例如 Alice 是信誉良好的会员）。如果指定方的法定人数（例如 BanklessDAO 的 5 个成员）证明了同一条数据（例如 Alice 是 BanklessDAO 中信誉良好的成员），那么 Alice 可以共享她的 DAO 成员身份可验证的演示文稿，例如其他 DAO 的成员身份证明或可以独立验证的人。\n\n由于可验证表示具有来自多方的签名，因此它可能被称为“多重签名”可验证表示，类似于需要多方批准才能批准给定交易的钱包的方式，类似的多重批准者功能用于链下数据可以被描述为使用 W3C 标准的可验证表示以及签名者的子集（n 的 m 个）甚至完整的（n 个）签名者集。多重签名可验证的代表制将允许 DAO 参与集体声誉的建立，并从 DAO 本身发布可验证的演示文稿。与从 DAO 分配资金的多重签名钱包一样，多重签名可验证的演示文稿也可以类似地从 DAO 分配声誉。\n\n在新公司证明自己的艰巨任务使许多人从事令人不满意的工作，并被在新环境中重建声誉的前景所吓倒。这种压抑的转换成本导致劳动力市场效率低下，并阻碍了角色之间的轻松转换。为了为自由市场提供有效的基础设施，转换工作的成本必须直线下降。当员工想要离职从事不同的工作时，当转换成本为零时，我们可以创造更有效的市场。\n\n这种互操作性可以为加入新的DAO用户节省大量时间，这种可移植的声誉在一个上下文中生成并在另一个上下文中得到验证。今天，DAO 成员每次加入一个新的 DAO 时都必须从头开始，不管他们在其他地方展示了什么样的技能。更自动化的 DAO 录取流程可以允许某些凭证的持有者自动被录取。这个未来的DAO允许成员从其他的DAO，WEB3环境或生态系统存在的信誉申请入会（如代码贡献胚根，参与Gitcoin，子补充和元数据的图形网络， 出席复康等）。\n\n**基于 VP 的 DAO 录取的验证过程可以：**\n\n检查 DAO 智能合约以识别规范签名者（例如 Gnosis Safe 合约上的 5 个签名者）\n\n检查给定的可验证演示文稿是否包含由来自该 DAO 合同的签名者的足够子集（例如 5 个中的 3 个）签名的可验证凭据\n\n如果经过验证，则允许个人参与 DAO\n\n新成员可以在第 0 天被分配到新 DAO 中的角色、机会和责任，而无需尽力攀登社会阶梯和向 Discord 渠道展示价值的劳动。未来的工作看起来不像是一个低效的劳动力市场，人们需要在每个新环境中证明自己，但这就是目前加入新 DAO 的现实。便携式工作证明可以消除在每个新环境或 DAO 中从头开始建立可信度的需要。\n\n加入后，个人将能够通过为 DAO 做出积极贡献来获得声誉凭证，然后将能够将这种声誉带到另一个 DAO，在那里他们从事其他项目并添加更多凭证。可移植性促进了跨 DAO 声誉，自由流动的数据可能为更多方与该数据交互提供机会（因此强调了对隐私、安全和同意的需求）。在数据主体同意和隐私是优先事项的更加自主的未来中，必须通过 DID 和 VC 将数据可验证地脱链移动。另一种选择是将声誉放在链上，如上所述，这可能会产生许多危险的后果（并且非常昂贵！）。\n\n将一个 DAO 的凭证用于另一个 DAO 的能力，这反映了我们已经通过集中身份和声誉证明享有的声誉可移植性。因为 VC 可以证明各种个人数据，包括各个级别的KYC所需的数据（了解您的客户——与识别个人客户相关的流程和数据，在传统金融中很常见），我们可以使用 VC 来启用便携式 KYC 并避免敏感个人数据的重复副本。欧盟监管沙箱中的 Alastria 项目为这种声誉可移植性铺平了道路。在更传统的情况下，信用卡和水电费账单等身份证明相当于申请图书证时的居住证明。像公共图书馆这样的组织已经决定信用卡对账单和水电费账单有资格作为有效的身份证明，因此他们将给定声誉资产的信任锚委托给另一个机构（例如公用事业和信用卡公司），并将它们指向为居住的代理。\n\n# DAO 去中心化的上限\n\n我们渴望能够解决复杂协调问题的 DAO，例如创建产品并将其推向市场。与资本分配不同，运输产品需要具有不同专业知识的各种不同角色，这些角色必须进行协调。同样与财务 DAO 不同的是，运输产品所需的人员和角色不可替代。\n\n对于尝试完成复杂协调任务的 DAO来说，成员技能和经验对于分配职责至关重要。不同角色之间真正复杂的协调依赖于声誉系统。如上所述，去中心化 DAO 工具针对资本分配进行了优化，因此唯一能够真正实现 DAO 化并仅凭基于钱包的声誉的公司就是国债。\n\nDAO 与分配资金的财富越不相似，DAO 的去中心化程度就越低，因为它必须依赖中心化工具来传递声誉信号。这个明显的上限限制了 DAO 的增长和去中心化，希望能够超越国库。想要做的不仅仅是资本分配的 DAO 注定要依赖中心化的工具和链上身份，直到他们接受去中心化的身份和声誉。\n\n\n---\n\n通过

{"id": "rM0WUT0MM6LnEOJfZv1lhzCMr7dgc8SB3ughXE2Axu8", "title": "你了解区块链该读的第一篇文章：区块链将如何改变世界？", "body": "想象一下：我们重新回到金本位的世界，然后把每个人拥有的黄金数量都记录在支付宝里，我们买东西和转账都通过这个黄金支付宝来完成，而实物黄金被我们藏在一个谁也找不到的地方。\n\n这就是数字货币试图为我们描述的世界，有一种不依赖国家主权的物品（这里是黄金）充当一般等价物，你会发现其实这个一般等价物是什么并不重要，历史上也出现过白银甚至贝壳充当一般等价物的情况，当然，它也可以是比特币，真正重要的是，这个一般等价物要被大家所接受。\n\n但是数字货币的世界还是有点不同，在数字货币的世界中，并不存在支付宝，而是存在一套系统，它不属于任何人或公司，由多数人共同维护和控制，可以免费的帮我们记录资产和交易，而且从来不会犯错，也无法被攻击。这个系统就是区块链。\n\n## 怎么可能有人接受比特币？\n\n问出这个问题，显然你还没有接受比特币，这并不奇怪，这个世界的大多数人都没有接受比特币，但是当然也有一部分人选择了接受比特币，例如微软公司就接受比特币支付。目前比特币总价值超过了100亿美元，单个比特币的价格在3800元人民币左右。\n\n比特币并不是一夜之间获得现在的接受程度的，事实上从比特币面世到现在经历了近8年的时间，在2010年的时候产生了第一笔比特币交易，当时一个人用一万个比特币买了一个披萨（现在看这可能是有史以来最贵的披萨），所以比特币有一个逐渐被接受的过程，因此正确的问题应该是，到底是什么促进了比特币被接受？\n\n显然世界上最初没有比特币，产生比特币的过程被称为挖矿，你可以把它想象成开采黄金。不过比特币的挖矿是一个比拼算数题的过程，系统会为所有正在挖矿的计算机出一道数学题，谁先做出了这道题，谁就获得了比特币。影响挖矿产出的因素主要是算力，算力越高的机器挖出比特币的概率就越大。\n\n和开采黄金一样，比特币的挖矿也有成本，需要消耗电力和磨损硬件，现在用普通计算机挖矿，消耗的资源大概是挖出比特币价值的十倍，所以想通过挖矿致富的小伙伴可以洗洗睡了。真正专业的矿场多数都建在水电站的旁边，低成本的获得能源，并且会对软硬件进行优化，关于挖矿的更多细节，[可以参考这篇文章](http://www.jpm.cn/article-2296-1.html)。\n\n回到我们的问题，比特币是如何流行的？答案是，不同时期挖矿的效率是不同的，在早期参与挖矿的机器少，竞争也比较少，更容易挖出比特币，当然这个时候比特币并不值钱，早期参与挖矿的也都是一些极客，他们通常都有这样的预期：比特币在未来将会更流行。\n\n**流通本身会带来价值**，在我们开头黄金的例子中，其实我们把黄金藏起来并不影响人们使用电子黄金进行交易，也就是说大家看重的不是黄金的价值，而是其作为价值载体的流通价值。从经济学的角度说，挖矿的供给是相对稳定的，更广泛的流通意味着有更多的人和场景需要比特币，而需求的增加将推升比特币价格。\n\n也就是说，如果你认为比特币会更流行，比特币的价格就存在上涨的预期，于是就会有更多的人参与挖矿，也会有人参与投机，总之会有越来越多的人参与进来，这一过程又促进了比特币价格上涨，形成一个正反馈的循环，比特币的早期参与者也因此获益。\n\n当然真实情况要复杂的多，另外一个重要的因素是，需要不断有人开拓比特币支付的场景，让更多的商家接受比特币支付，这样才能真正促进比特币作为货币的流通，不过其实问题的关键，还是让更多的人了解和接受比特币和数字货币的概念。\n\n## 没有支付宝，数字货币如何被记录？\n\n这里我们需要来解释一下区块链和比特币的关系，上面讲到，比特币挖矿是一个比拼算数学题的过程，在系统的设计中，每当比特币被挖到的时候，同时会产生一个叫做区块的东西，每个区块会记录从上一个区块产生到目前的所有比特币交易。\n\n除此之外，每个区块还有一个头部和尾部，其功能是通过密码学的原理，把相邻的区块连接起来，形成区块链，实现的效果是，如果某个区块的内容被篡改，就会与其相邻的区块产生冲突，进而被发现。\n\n区块链的设计机制是只有最长的链是有效的，假设有一个坏节点希望篡改区块链的内容，它无法改变某个单独的区块，只能争取产生新的假区块，这就需要和全网所有其他节点对抗，所以如果这个节点拥有超过全网50%的运算能力，就能实现对区块链进行控制，专业术语叫做算力攻击。\n\n目前比特币系统已经遍布全球，很难对其进行算力攻击，即使真的有人能做到，付出的成本也大于获得的价值，这就从经济学的角度杜绝了算力攻击。随着比特币网络越来越大，其价值会越来越高，但相应其算力也会越来越高，从而维持了这一平衡。\n\n**事实上区块链是一套去中心化的记账系统**。一般对于记账系统来说，记账行为和数据存储都是中心化的，去中心化记账相当于把账本分别存储在不同的地方，同时又由不同的人来记账，于是如何解决记账一致性的问题就是关键所在。\n\n区块链技术的特别之处，就在于通过竞争记账（算数学题）的方式，巧妙的解决了这一问题。当一个节点算出了数学题，可以迅速的向其他节点进行验证，当足够多的节点承认了这一结果后，系统就会进行确认，这就既避免了需要一个中心化的权威机构来做判断，又防止了恶意节点的操纵。\n\n## 区块链将如何改变世界？\n\n现在终于可以回答我们题目的问题，区块链将如何改变世界？读到这你有没有发现，如果我们接受了基于区块链的数字货币，其实我们就不需要银行了？事实上你也不会听说任何比特币银行。\n\n区块链对银行的替代作用和支付宝对银行的替代作用有相似的地方，我们把钱存在银行，无非出于3个原因：利息、安全、更方便的支付，这些功能支付宝都具备，而区块链具备后两者，不过财富管理带来的收益可以替代利息收益。\n\n无论是支付宝还是银行，都是中心化的记账系统，当我们使用非现金的方式付账的时候，需要有一个权威的记账机构，向商家证明我们的账户里真的有钱，并且帮我们把钱转付给商家。银行作为记账机构的权威性来自国家监管的背书，而我们相信支付宝是因为阿里巴巴的信用和技术能力。\n\n但是这样一个记账中介的存在产生了巨大的成本，想一想银行有多少线下网点，有多少服务人员吧。此外，每个银行都会有自己的 IT 记账系统，用户在支付和转账的时候，就会在银行间形成交易，分别被两个银行记录，这就涉及到对账和结算的问题。\n\n国内的交易还好说，因为有央行作为权威机构，在银行间进行清算，但是国际交易因为没有权威机构作为中介，各国的清算系统和流程又有很大差异，导致交易变得十分麻烦。\n\n区块链的解决方式是去中心化的，所有的交易都被公开的记录在区块链上，这就省去了对账的麻烦，跨国的交易也不需要等到当天银行结算后完成，而是可以实时到账。目前国际清算每笔的成本约26美元，如果区块链得以应用，仅此一项每年节约的费用就在数十甚至上百亿美元。\n\n更进一步来说，整个金融体系就是一个信任体系，原本这一体系是通过国家背书、金融监管的方式建立信任，**而区块链的出现，是用技术的手段解决了信任问题，从而对现有的金融系统提出了一套成本更低的替代解决方案**。\n\n再举一个例子，我们在交易所交易股票需要支付手续费，以覆盖交易所和证券体系运行的成本。但是如果区块链可以记录所有的股票交易，理论上我们也不再需要交易所了。按照A股每天2000亿交易额，平均交易成本万分之五计算，仅仅中国的股票交易，每天将节约成本1亿元。\n\n当一个行业成本结构发生变化的时候，往往会出现剧烈的变革，从这个角度来说，区块链将会重塑金融行业。全球金融行业每年的产值在数万亿美元，任何一个细分领域的应用，都将是一个庞大的市场。\n\n不仅如此，区块链创造的可信任的记账体系还有很多其他应用，例如记录影视、音乐、出版等行业的版权和交易；记录数字资产的发行；记录病史和就医情况，方便医生了解病人情况；记录供应链各个环节的生产，从而实现供应链的溯源，防止假货的产生等等。\n\n区块链向我们展示了一个所有资产都将被数字化的世界，在一个价值的互联网上，资产的转移将像今天信息的传递一样快捷、方便、便宜。不知道写到这里，你是不是还认为我在描述一个未来世界？在这里借用威廉·吉布森的一句话来结尾：未来已来，只是尚未流行。", "timestamp": 1653373825, "digest": "mIiMTR98A6BAXkt9Z0JBmKciz9XTYrPThCrAo3g9RCA", "contributor": "0x91e41069F5300128bbdeed94659A3Fe28499FF1E"}

the centrepiece of a hip-hop electronic crossover who’s performed at Art Basel and SXSW.\n\n[https://twitter.com/angelbaby/status/1502424206406873088?s=20&t=fCiX4zQnH4d1QVKEHbrqAQ](https://twitter.com/angelbaby/status/1502424206406873088?s=20&t=fCiX4zQnH4d1QVKEHbrqAQ)\n\nWith a couple NFT releases under their belt, angelbaby has been [taking to Twitter](https://twitter.com/angelbaby/status/1522679962003640320?s=20&t=fCiX4zQnH4d1QVKEHbrqAQ) to share insights into the world being cultivated through the release of an upcoming EP.\n\n[https://twitter.com/wearehume/status/1528843899225411584?s=20&t=o7KrPc6jxoof9Ed86ya6SQ](https://twitter.com/wearehume/status/1528843899225411584?s=20&t=o7KrPc6jxoof9Ed86ya6SQ)\n\nAs a collective, Hume works with different avatar projects - in this case FLUF World - to create artist identities around an emerging NFT series.\n\nWe can expect fans to collect through a multitude of vehicles, enjoying airdrops and governance rights for being active members of the community.\n\n## RŌHKI\n\n[RŌHKI](https://twitter.com/rohki) is a duo from two eternal beings - IO and HACHI.\n\nThe pseudo-anonymous artist project recently premiered their debut single - [Desperado](https://www.rohki.xyz/portal/desperado).\n\n[https://twitter.com/rohki/status/1527104550556995584?s=20&t=HtXF9OvNTNOIllEg5uqG3Q](https://twitter.com/rohki/status/1527104550556995584?s=20&t=HtXF9OvNTNOIllEg5uqG3Q)\n\nAfter selling out their [Genesis Key](https://opensea.io/collection/rohki-genesis-key) just an hour after a stealth launch, collectors were able to access a limited pre-mint a day in advance of a public sale.\n\nThe playbook for RŌHKI looks like this:\n\n* Release a Mint Pass in the form of Genesis Keys\n* Grant holders priority access to mint each Episode\n* Collect all Episodes in Season One for a special reward\n\nUnlike other Music NFTs, RŌHKI has placed extra emphasis on the visual presentation, debuting each Episode with a 4k animated music video and three different rarity tiers to bat.\n\nThe public mint [sold out](https://opensea.io/collection/rohki-desperado) within an hour, granting collectors a pre-reveal vial.\n\n[https://twitter.com/rohki/status/1526255575960412160?s=20&t=o7KrPc6jxoof9Ed86ya6SQ](https://twitter.com/rohki/status/1526255575960412160?s=20&t=o7KrPc6jxoof9Ed86ya6SQ)\n\nA week later, the vials morphed with the debut of the music video - creating a rarity game around the different tiers (Immersive, Dynamic and Static) of the Episode.\n\nAs found on [rohki.xyz](https://www.rohki.xyz/) and a series of [Mirror posts](https://mirror.xyz/0x99895960B30A34F8431517c4f5B52A1f4b9854a3), each RŌHKI release is custom-tailored to match each experience.\n\nWhile the act is not native to any existing avatar project, the lore suggests that an entire world will be created around Season 1 and beyond.\n\n## Bored Brothers\n\nThe star-studded side project of Kygo and Ryan Tedder took to Sound.xyz this month with the release of a debut single [“DRIP”](https://www.sound.xyz/boredbrothers/drip).\n\nWith Kygo boasting 30 million monthly listeners on Spotify, his pairing with Ryan Tedder - the lead singer of OneRepublic and debatably the [greatest songwriter of all-time](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/10-great-songs-you-didnt-know-onerepublics-ryan-tedder-wrote-250513/) - makes for a smash duo unlike anything web3 has seen before.\n\nThe [Bored Brothers](https://twitter.com/boredbrothers_) featured both platinum-selling artists pairing up their Bored Apes to release music under a new alias native to web3.\n\n[https://twitter.com/boredbrothers_/status/1517613226225127424?s=20&t=fCiX4zQnH4d1QVKEHbrqAQ](https://twitter.com/boredbrothers_/status/1517613226225127424?s=20&t=fCiX4zQnH4d1QVKEHbrqAQ)\n\nWith a pre-sale page made exclusive to BAYC holders, the Bored Brothers created an outlet for two artists who are normally subject to major label restrictions to experiment in the world of web3 with full autonomy.\n\nRyan Tedder teased a feature from a well-known rapper in their upcoming music video - another character who’s IRL tattoo is expected to make their web3 music debut through the next Bored Brothers release.\n\nMetastars created an outlet for two major artists to explor eweb3, and in the process, test the waters for what a community-owned project could look like when built from scratch.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nWe’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg with Music NFTs.\n\n[https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/8OrpDmu5wboGX36-vXIt3gBMQMoihY0k_kV4XowlMMo](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/8OrpDmu5wboGX36-vXIt3gBMQMoihY0k_kV4XowlMMo)\n\nMetastars are gearing up to release their first full projects - all of which are set to debut with Music NFTs as the way the song(s) premier.\n\nExpect this summer to be full of Music NFT debuts.  \n  \n These are the first of many ways to get involved.

{"id": "ZwfqpKZ15G3PwD5pRJBtmX_IJ0qkTqSaOoCL4o0y7JQ", "title": "你了解区块链该读的第一篇文章：区块链将如何改变世界？", "body": "想象一下：我们重新回到金本位的世界，然后把每个人拥有的黄金数量都记录在支付宝里，我们买东西和转账都通过这个黄金支付宝来完成，而实物黄金被我们藏在一个谁也找不到的地方。\n\n这就是数字货币试图为我们描述的世界，有一种不依赖国家主权的物品（这里是黄金）充当一般等价物，你会发现其实这个一般等价物是什么并不重要，历史上也出现过白银甚至贝壳充当一般等价物的情况，当然，它也可以是比特币，真正重要的是，这个一般等价物要被大家所接受。\n\n但是数字货币的世界还是有点不同，在数字货币的世界中，并不存在支付宝，而是存在一套系统，它不属于任何人或公司，由多数人共同维护和控制，可以免费的帮我们记录资产和交易，而且从来不会犯错，也无法被攻击。这个系统就是区块链。\n\n## 怎么可能有人接受比特币？\n\n问出这个问题，显然你还没有接受比特币，这并不奇怪，这个世界的大多数人都没有接受比特币，但是当然也有一部分人选择了接受比特币，例如微软公司就接受比特币支付。目前比特币总价值超过了100亿美元，单个比特币的价格在3800元人民币左右。\n\n比特币并不是一夜之间获得现在的接受程度的，事实上从比特币面世到现在经历了近8年的时间，在2010年的时候产生了第一笔比特币交易，当时一个人用一万个比特币买了一个披萨（现在看这可能是有史以来最贵的披萨），所以比特币有一个逐渐被接受的过程，因此正确的问题应该是，到底是什么促进了比特币被接受？\n\n显然世界上最初没有比特币，产生比特币的过程被称为挖矿，你可以把它想象成开采黄金。不过比特币的挖矿是一个比拼算数题的过程，系统会为所有正在挖矿的计算机出一道数学题，谁先做出了这道题，谁就获得了比特币。影响挖矿产出的因素主要是算力，算力越高的机器挖出比特币的概率就越大。\n\n和开采黄金一样，比特币的挖矿也有成本，需要消耗电力和磨损硬件，现在用普通计算机挖矿，消耗的资源大概是挖出比特币价值的十倍，所以想通过挖矿致富的小伙伴可以洗洗睡了。真正专业的矿场多数都建在水电站的旁边，低成本的获得能源，并且会对软硬件进行优化，关于挖矿的更多细节，[可以参考这篇文章](http://www.jpm.cn/article-2296-1.html)。\n\n回到我们的问题，比特币是如何流行的？答案是，不同时期挖矿的效率是不同的，在早期参与挖矿的机器少，竞争也比较少，更容易挖出比特币，当然这个时候比特币并不值钱，早期参与挖矿的也都是一些极客，他们通常都有这样的预期：比特币在未来将会更流行。\n\n**流通本身会带来价值**，在我们开头黄金的例子中，其实我们把黄金藏起来并不影响人们使用电子黄金进行交易，也就是说大家看重的不是黄金的价值，而是其作为价值载体的流通价值。从经济学的角度说，挖矿的供给是相对稳定的，更广泛的流通意味着有更多的人和场景需要比特币，而需求的增加将推升比特币价格。\n\n也就是说，如果你认为比特币会更流行，比特币的价格就存在上涨的预期，于是就会有更多的人参与挖矿，也会有人参与投机，总之会有越来越多的人参与进来，这一过程又促进了比特币价格上涨，形成一个正反馈的循环，比特币的早期参与者也因此获益。\n\n当然真实情况要复杂的多，另外一个重要的因素是，需要不断有人开拓比特币支付的场景，让更多的商家接受比特币支付，这样才能真正促进比特币作为货币的流通，不过其实问题的关键，还是让更多的人了解和接受比特币和数字货币的概念。\n\n## 没有支付宝，数字货币如何被记录？\n\n这里我们需要来解释一下区块链和比特币的关系，上面讲到，比特币挖矿是一个比拼算数学题的过程，在系统的设计中，每当比特币被挖到的时候，同时会产生一个叫做区块的东西，每个区块会记录从上一个区块产生到目前的所有比特币交易。\n\n除此之外，每个区块还有一个头部和尾部，其功能是通过密码学的原理，把相邻的区块连接起来，形成区块链，实现的效果是，如果某个区块的内容被篡改，就会与其相邻的区块产生冲突，进而被发现。\n\n区块链的设计机制是只有最长的链是有效的，假设有一个坏节点希望篡改区块链的内容，它无法改变某个单独的区块，只能争取产生新的假区块，这就需要和全网所有其他节点对抗，所以如果这个节点拥有超过全网50%的运算能力，就能实现对区块链进行控制，专业术语叫做算力攻击。\n\n目前比特币系统已经遍布全球，很难对其进行算力攻击，即使真的有人能做到，付出的成本也大于获得的价值，这就从经济学的角度杜绝了算力攻击。随着比特币网络越来越大，其价值会越来越高，但相应其算力也会越来越高，从而维持了这一平衡。\n\n**事实上区块链是一套去中心化的记账系统**。一般对于记账系统来说，记账行为和数据存储都是中心化的，去中心化记账相当于把账本分别存储在不同的地方，同时又由不同的人来记账，于是如何解决记账一致性的问题就是关键所在。\n\n区块链技术的特别之处，就在于通过竞争记账（算数学题）的方式，巧妙的解决了这一问题。当一个节点算出了数学题，可以迅速的向其他节点进行验证，当足够多的节点承认了这一结果后，系统就会进行确认，这就既避免了需要一个中心化的权威机构来做判断，又防止了恶意节点的操纵。\n\n## 区块链将如何改变世界？\n\n现在终于可以回答我们题目的问题，区块链将如何改变世界？读到这你有没有发现，如果我们接受了基于区块链的数字货币，其实我们就不需要银行了？事实上你也不会听说任何比特币银行。\n\n区块链对银行的替代作用和支付宝对银行的替代作用有相似的地方，我们把钱存在银行，无非出于3个原因：利息、安全、更方便的支付，这些功能支付宝都具备，而区块链具备后两者，不过财富管理带来的收益可以替代利息收益。\n\n无论是支付宝还是银行，都是中心化的记账系统，当我们使用非现金的方式付账的时候，需要有一个权威的记账机构，向商家证明我们的账户里真的有钱，并且帮我们把钱转付给商家。银行作为记账机构的权威性来自国家监管的背书，而我们相信支付宝是因为阿里巴巴的信用和技术能力。\n\n但是这样一个记账中介的存在产生了巨大的成本，想一想银行有多少线下网点，有多少服务人员吧。此外，每个银行都会有自己的 IT 记账系统，用户在支付和转账的时候，就会在银行间形成交易，分别被两个银行记录，这就涉及到对账和结算的问题。\n\n国内的交易还好说，因为有央行作为权威机构，在银行间进行清算，但是国际交易因为没有权威机构作为中介，各国的清算系统和流程又有很大差异，导致交易变得十分麻烦。\n\n区块链的解决方式是去中心化的，所有的交易都被公开的记录在区块链上，这就省去了对账的麻烦，跨国的交易也不需要等到当天银行结算后完成，而是可以实时到账。目前国际清算每笔的成本约26美元，如果区块链得以应用，仅此一项每年节约的费用就在数十甚至上百亿美元。\n\n更进一步来说，整个金融体系就是一个信任体系，原本这一体系是通过国家背书、金融监管的方式建立信任，**而区块链的出现，是用技术的手段解决了信任问题，从而对现有的金融系统提出了一套成本更低的替代解决方案**。\n\n再举一个例子，我们在交易所交易股票需要支付手续费，以覆盖交易所和证券体系运行的成本。但是如果区块链可以记录所有的股票交易，理论上我们也不再需要交易所了。按照A股每天2000亿交易额，平均交易成本万分之五计算，仅仅中国的股票交易，每天将节约成本1亿元。\n\n当一个行业成本结构发生变化的时候，往往会出现剧烈的变革，从这个角度来说，区块链将会重塑金融行业。全球金融行业每年的产值在数万亿美元，任何一个细分领域的应用，都将是一个庞大的市场。\n\n不仅如此，区块链创造的可信任的记账体系还有很多其他应用，例如记录影视、音乐、出版等行业的版权和交易；记录数字资产的发行；记录病史和就医情况，方便医生了解病人情况；记录供应链各个环节的生产，从而实现供应链的溯源，防止假货的产生等等。\n\n区块链向我们展示了一个所有资产都将被数字化的世界，在一个价值的互联网上，资产的转移将像今天信息的传递一样快捷、方便、便宜。不知道写到这里，你是不是还认为我在描述一个未来世界？在这里借用威廉·吉布森的一句话来结尾：未来已来，只是尚未流行。", "timestamp": 1653373798, "digest": "mIiMTR98A6BAXkt9Z0JBmKciz9XTYrPThCrAo3g9RCA", "contributor": "0x91e41069F5300128bbdeed94659A3Fe28499FF1E"}

{"id": "_p_smnjngOB0GgOWPk4pUQ57UX5FYgoEg4LTY4T2IJo", "title": "区块链的工作原理及其可能对世界带来的影响", "body": "我们经常听到区块链这个概念，但是很少有人知道它到底是什么，它的工作原理，以及它能造成什么影响。纽约大学Stern商学院的David Yermack发表于Review of Finance的论文《[公司治理与区块链](https://academic.oup.com/rof/article/doi/10.1093/rof/rfw074/2888422/Corporate-Governance-and-Blockchains)》，是一篇很到位的科普文，它从非技术性角度清晰地回答了上述问题。以下只是不完整的概述，我强烈推荐各位阅读完整的论文。\n\n**区块链是什么？**\n\n一个区块链是一个信息的数据库，用来储存不经任何篡改的交易记录。这些记录可能包括了资产（股票、债券、房地产、汽车、艺术品）的所有权、出生证明、驾照，以及已投的选票。区块链最为人知的功能是储存了比特币的所有权记录，但是它的潜在应用范围远比这要广泛。和目前的记录储存方式相比，区块链有三个主要优势：\n\n* 成本。交易记录可以被自动更新，节省了诸如投票计票，或者请律师变更土地所有权一类的开支。\n* 迅速。交易记录几乎可以做到实时更新。相反，一个公司的账户也许每年只更新一次，并且投票的统计也需要时间。\n* 数据完整性。土地信息可能被篡改，公司损益表可以被操纵，期权可以回溯，但区块链中的数据却没有人能够更改。\n\n**区块链的工作原理**\n\n一个区块就是记录的一个集合。比如，一个比特币区块包含了在10分钟内（上图中的Merkle根（或Tx_Root））发生的所有比特币交易；每笔交易的记录包含时间、发送者、接收者，以及该笔交易的比特币数量。时间戳记录该区块的创建时间。\n\n一个区块链由一系列的区块构成，这些区块被一个哈希函数（散列函数）连接起来。哈希函数是一种将数据转换成一个十六进制编码的密码学，这些编码不能倒回去重现原始输入值。区块12的头部包含有反映区块11内容的哈希函数，区块11的头部又有反映区块10的内容的哈希函数，以此类推。这样一来，要在前面的一个区块上造假就是不可能的，因为这将会导致之后的所有区块的哈希值都发生变化，因此这种造假就很会容易被察觉。若有人想要篡改历史交易，那么他/她就不得不为后续所有的区块重新找到有效的哈希值。\n\n市场中任何一个参与者都可以更新一个公开区块链的信息——没有中心化的权威机构（不同于有土地注册处在管理土地所有权）。要创建区块13，一个参与者必须将新一笔交易的数据（并没有被包含在之前的任何区块里）和区块12的哈希值、时间戳，以及一个随机数拼接在一起。一个随机数就是和区块中的其他信息结合在一起能够生成一个新哈希值的随机数字。有效的哈希值必须在某个范围内，比如，必须有几个零开头。一个参与者需要不断试错，通过找到一个满足要求的随机数来生成区块13对应的哈希值。一旦有一个参与者率先成功了，其他成员会检验并承认区块13已经完成，然后去计算区块14。\n\n这个胜出的参与者会得到12.5个比特币的奖励（在比特币区块链里）；因此，这些有可能获得奖励的参与者就是我们所称的矿工。这个奖励鼓励矿工将新交易拼接起来并建立新的区块——这其实就是记账服务费。矿工选择他们想要包含在新区块里的任何交易，并对其进行编码；一般不会有两个矿工选中一模一样的交易组合。想要迅速获得交易证明的代理人，可以自愿付给将其交易成功编入下个区块的矿工一笔费用（作为激励）。\n\n这篇论文也介绍了私有和许可区块链。在两种区块链里，记录的更新是由一方或一个小组（由多方组成）来完成的。对这些区块链的监管本身又是另一个很有意思的议题，那篇论文同样也有提到。\n\n**区块链会如何影响现实世界？**\n\n最有意思的是这篇论文关于区块链潜在的变革性影响力的讨论。\n\n* 所有权透明度增加。交易记录将会即刻对每个人可见。目前，在美国，机构投资者头寸的13F报告每季度只发布一次。此外，公司有三种不同的股东名单（公司、交易所、代理投票）；公司往往并不知道他们真正的股东是谁。\n  * 透明度可以让投资者很难做到获得一个区块而不改变股价，这样就会加重Grossman和Hart在1980年提出的搭便车问题（Kyle and Vila (1991)）。\n\n\n  * 透明度能够阻止内部交易，并且相反会鼓励外界获得信息（Fishman and Hagerty (1992), Bushman, Piotoski, and Smith (2005)）。它同样会使期权奖励或者其他任何金融交易回溯的情况变为不可能。（Fishman and Hagerty (1992), Bushman, Piotoski, and Smith (2005)）\n* 更强的流动性。执行和完成股票交易可以更加迅速实惠。在美国，目前的结算往往需要3天时间并有多方介入才能完成。\n  * 流动性可以加强股东通过行使发言权（请见Maug (1998) 和Kahn and Winton (1998)的模型，及Norli, Ostergaard, and Schindele (2015)提出的证据）和退出投资（请见Admati and Pfleiderer (2009) 和 Edmans (2009)的模型，及Edmans, Fang, and Zur (2013)，还有Roosenboom, Schlingemann, and Vasconcelos (2014)提出的证据）实现的公司治理。\n\n\n  * 不仅是活跃的股东，普通人也可以从中受益。目前，从苏黎世汇款到纽约手续费是7%并且需要花3天时间。\n* 投票。区块链可以用来记录公司选举的投票。这将会提高选举准确性，并且化解关于管理层通过幕后操纵赢得绝大多数投票结果非常接近的选举的顾虑。由于股票的借贷将会变得透明，区块链同时也会让空洞投票（模型搭建于Brav and Mathews (2011), 实证研究于Hu and Black (2006) 和Christoffersen, Geczy, Musto, and Reed (2007)）变得更难。\n* 实时记账。一个公司可以在区块链上发布其所有的商业交易，让任何人在任何时候都可以合计出他们的损益表和资产负债表。这可以大大地减少对审计员的需求、防止应计盈余管理、阻止关联方交易。\n* 智能合约。智能合约是一种自动执行合约的方式：比如，如果借款人车贷违约，那么无人驾驶汽车可以自己开回银行。区块链可以很低廉地执行智能合约，比如一违约就改变抵押物的所有权。这从根本上减少了强制执行的成本。金融学教授们以后可能就再也没法写关于扣押抵押品的难点的论文了！\n\n**这只是一个白日梦吗？**\n\n许多革命性的科技都只是昙花一现，但有的却真的带来了变革性的影响。区块链会不负众望吗？2016年的三个比较突出的活动表明了它也许可以。\n\n* 澳大利亚证券交易所公布了一项计划，该计划准备使用区块链技术来重新设计其清算和结算系统，其他许多主要证券市场也开展了探索性的项目。\n* 纳斯达克证券交易所公布了一个在股东会议上利用区块链平台进行投票的试点计划。管理几乎所有美国大选计票工作的私企Broadridge开始下大力气做相关研究，准备在美国公司选举投票中使用区块链。\n\n美国上市公司Overstock.com于2016年11月在一个区块链上发行了股票，这样他们虽然在监管机构处注册了股份，但并没有经过传统的证券交易所。", "timestamp": 1653373974, "digest": "Yt7-Sk0HanUf_G7xB2PGu8b3XeboHg4wQr0X7rFE51A", "contributor": "0x91e41069F5300128bbdeed94659A3Fe28499FF1E"}

{"id": "0qrhvQxONAZjkJ-zhwqwmqVGlv2QyFCSDi4fAMg5wKo", "title": "How To Mint an Entry on Mirror", "body": "## gm 🐰\n\nWhen you think about NFTs, written articles aren’t the first thing that come to mind. But **Mirror** is quickly changing that. In this guide, we’re going to dive into **[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)** - **a web3 toolkit for sharing stories, funding ideas, and turning text-based content into NFTs** - **and mint an entry of our own!**\n\n## What Do I Need?\n\nBefore we begin, let’s make sure you have your gear in order. To mint an entry on Mirror, you will need:\n\n* An Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask or Rainbow\n* Some ETH in your wallet to mint your article as an NFT. It is free to publish an article on Mirror, but minting it as an NFT will require gas fees.\n\n*If you need help getting set up, head over to our **[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCECH_RfQJOShGkYIVEXAX7w).** There, you’ll find guides for **[setting up your wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VghMd-I_-I&t=1s)** and **[purchasing some ETH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqlmAXtWSCE)!***\n\n## NFTs & Mirror\n\nWhile today’s most popular NFTs are image-based, pictures are just a fraction of what NFTs are capable of. At their core, **NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are simply proofs of ownership written on a blockchain**. These proofs of ownership represent an asset, digital or physical, and link it to an individual's blockchain address. The result is a publicly verifiable file, showing a certain thing owned by a certain person.\n\nSo, can an article be an NFT? Absolutely!\n\nAt first glance, **Mirror** may just look like a web3 platform for publishing and monetizing articles — something like a blockchain-based Medium or Substack. But under the hood, Mirror is a powerful tool for creating content and building communities. It gives you everything you need for minting NFTs, crowdfunding, splitting proceeds from sales, and even minting ERC20 tokens to distribute to new community members.\n\n**Today, we’re going to write our first Mirror entries and mint them as NFTs. Let’s go!**\n\n## The Guide\n\n### Step 1\n\nFirst, head to **[mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/)** and **connect your wallet** with the button in the top-right corner.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JYg4ABTPHcDHoMwwxLkBQ.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 2\n\nIf this is your first time using Mirror, **go to the Settings tab** in the left toolbar to set your profile picture, bio, color theme, and display name.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uJXszMCnMGYiKzUigVdCy.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 3\n\nOnce you're happy with your profile settings, go back to the **Entries** tab and **click *Create Your First Entry***.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_z0E8xpQ5lTY-jOrSjiLE.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 4\n\nNow on the Write page, you’ll have access to Mirror’s text editor. This includes all of the writing platform essentials - headings, bulleted lists, images, and blockquotes. **Go ahead and write your article!** If you’re stumped and looking for inspiration, hop into the **[RabbitHole community Discord](https://discord.gg/G9XbdKfWgz)** for ideas to get your started!\n\nYou will also have access to a number of web3 tools for monetizing your work and incorporating other NFTs. These include Crowdfund, Edition, Auction, Split, and NFT Preview. We won’t be using these for our first entry, but you can learn more about them **[here](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide)**!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WjnsZIsSjd-Kxn1jlQt7M.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 5\n\nAfter you have written your article, **click the gear in the top-right corner** to bring up your article settings. Upload a **header image** (3000x1500 px) and enter a **meta title** and **entry excerpt**. Your header image will also represent your entry NFT when it is minted.\n\nOnce you're done, check your meta preview at the bottom of the article settings. This will show you how your article will appear on Mirror, search engines, and social media platforms. This is also a good time to **save your article as a draft** if you haven’t done so already. Just **click *Save Draft*** at the top.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ECl-b_LxwdcbF2lLeOQvd.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 6\n\nNow that you have a written article, a header image, and your meta settings all filled out, it’s time to **give everything a good double-check**. Once your article is minted as an NFT, you will not be able to make any edits or updates to it.\n\nAs with any NFT you mint, **this article will forever be associated with your wallet!** Even if you sell it, your wallet address will be shown as the original creator. So be sure to mint an original, quality article that you are happy to be associated with.\n\n### Step 7\n\nIf everything looks good to go, it’s time to publish and mint! **Click *Publish*** and **check the *Mint as NFT Edition* box**. A final menu will appear. If you haven’t added a header image yet you can do so here.\n\n**This menu will also contain the very important Funds recipient box.** This is the wallet address that funds will be sent to when your NFT sells. Copy your wallet address by clicking it and then paste it into this box.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bsm39UDQKOIjZXZfcXulN.png?height=990&width=1710)\n\n### Step 8\n\nGive everything one final review and, when you’re ready, **click *Publish And Mint Entry***. You will be minting this as an NFT on the blockchain, so you will need to pay a gas fee. **Confirm this transaction in your wallet** and pay the gas fee to mint your entry!\n\n## Congratulations!\n\nAnd that’s it! This transaction will take a few minutes to confirm, but once it has, **you’ll have officially minted your Mirror entry as an NFT!**\n\nMinting on Mirror is just one part of our NFT journey this season.

But **Mirror** is quickly changing that. In this guide, we’re going to dive into **[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)** - **a web3 toolkit for sharing stories, funding ideas, and turning text-based content into NFTs** - **and mint an entry of our own!**\n\n## What Do I Need?\n\nBefore we begin, let’s make sure you have your gear in order. To mint an entry on Mirror, you will need:\n\n* An Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask or Rainbow\n* Some ETH in your wallet to mint your article as an NFT. It is free to publish an article on Mirror, but minting it as an NFT will require gas fees.\n\n*If you need help getting set up, head over to our **[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCECH_RfQJOShGkYIVEXAX7w).** There, you’ll find guides for **[setting up your wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VghMd-I_-I&t=1s)** and **[purchasing some ETH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqlmAXtWSCE)!***\n\n## NFTs & Mirror\n\nWhile today’s most popular NFTs are image-based, pictures are just a fraction of what NFTs are capable of. At their core, **NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are simply proofs of ownership written on a blockchain**. These proofs of ownership represent an asset, digital or physical, and link it to an individual's blockchain address. The result is a publicly verifiable file, showing a certain thing owned by a certain person.\n\nSo, can an article be an NFT? Absolutely!\n\nAt first glance, **Mirror** may just look like a web3 platform for publishing and monetizing articles — something like a blockchain-based Medium or Substack. But under the hood, Mirror is a powerful tool for creating content and building communities. It gives you everything you need for minting NFTs, crowdfunding, splitting proceeds from sales, and even minting ERC20 tokens to distribute to new community members.\n\n**Today, we’re going to write our first Mirror entries and mint them as NFTs. Let’s go!**\n\n## The Guide\n\n### Step 1\n\nFirst, head to **[mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/)** and **connect your wallet** with the button in the top-right corner.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JYg4ABTPHcDHoMwwxLkBQ.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 2\n\nIf this is your first time using Mirror, **go to the Settings tab** in the left toolbar to set your profile picture, bio, color theme, and display name.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uJXszMCnMGYiKzUigVdCy.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 3\n\nOnce you're happy with your profile settings, go back to the **Entries** tab and **click *Create Your First Entry***.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_z0E8xpQ5lTY-jOrSjiLE.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 4\n\nNow on the Write page, you’ll have access to Mirror’s text editor. This includes all of the writing platform essentials - headings, bulleted lists, images, and blockquotes. **Go ahead and write your article!** If you’re stumped and looking for inspiration, hop into the **[RabbitHole community Discord](https://discord.gg/G9XbdKfWgz)** for ideas to get your started!\n\nYou will also have access to a number of web3 tools for monetizing your work and incorporating other NFTs. These include Crowdfund, Edition, Auction, Split, and NFT Preview. We won’t be using these for our first entry, but you can learn more about them **[here](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide)**!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WjnsZIsSjd-Kxn1jlQt7M.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 5\n\nAfter you have written your article, **click the gear in the top-right corner** to bring up your article settings. Upload a **header image** (3000x1500 px) and enter a **meta title** and **entry excerpt**. Your header image will also represent your entry NFT when it is minted.\n\nOnce you're done, check your meta preview at the bottom of the article settings. This will show you how your article will appear on Mirror, search engines, and social media platforms. This is also a good time to **save your article as a draft** if you haven’t done so already. Just **click *Save Draft*** at the top.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ECl-b_LxwdcbF2lLeOQvd.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 6\n\nNow that you have a written article, a header image, and your meta settings all filled out, it’s time to **give everything a good double-check**. Once your article is minted as an NFT, you will not be able to make any edits or updates to it.\n\nAs with any NFT you mint, **this article will forever be associated with your wallet!** Even if you sell it, your wallet address will be shown as the original creator. So be sure to mint an original, quality article that you are happy to be associated with.\n\n### Step 7\n\nIf everything looks good to go, it’s time to publish and mint! **Click *Publish*** and **check the *Mint as NFT Edition* box**. A final menu will appear. If you haven’t added a header image yet you can do so here.\n\n**This menu will also contain the very important Funds recipient box.** This is the wallet address that funds will be sent to when your NFT sells. Copy your wallet address by clicking it and then paste it into this box.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bsm39UDQKOIjZXZfcXulN.png?height=990&width=1710)\n\n### Step 8\n\nGive everything one final review and, when you’re ready, **click *Publish And Mint Entry***. You will be minting this as an NFT on the blockchain, so you will need to pay a gas fee. **Confirm this transaction in your wallet** and pay the gas fee to mint your entry!\n\n## Congratulations!\n\nAnd that’s it! This transaction will take a few minutes to confirm, but once it has, **you’ll have officially minted your Mirror entry as an NFT!**\n\nMinting on Mirror is just one part of our NFT journey this season.

Doodles，成为有史以来Opensea交易量第八的NFT项目和月销量排行的No.1（截止2022年2月17日），坐稳新晋蓝筹。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6tOQs0_aoOqxzR-xg5w_E.png?height=1045&width=1606)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9fjQCXDrYr5YTV6fU9rqA.png?height=1044&width=1604)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Fd7_ynJQseJ7hY5AypbR.png?height=812&width=1009)\n\n初触Azuki，进入discord社群仅有500多人，频道简洁、Alpha推介理由中只有一句——**“守望先锋艺术家”**。\n\n这一Title正好契合“中文NFT玩家不少游戏、电竞关注者”的事实，在最初给红豆带来了一波天然的流量（同理最近开启日式少女漫画风的项目“KillerGF”，也因为艺术家给英雄联盟创作了阿狸和KDA角色受到关注）。\n\n**Azuki的成功，并不仅仅因为艺术家。**\n\n反观所有目前的蓝筹NFT，艺术领域中最重要的“原创美感”是必不可少的因素。而NFT作为非同质化代币，如何能够**兼顾“社群身份的视觉共识”和“与众不同的专属印记”**？\n\n这个“同而不同”的艺术目标就成了新项目需要斟酌的问题——玩家想要创作获得项目方喜爱的Fan-art中也一样。\n\n不得不提到**0N1**——Azuki存在于大热又沉寂，同时也带火了白名单玩法的项目0N1之后，同属于侧面半身漫画类PFP，不得不承认它有着一些以0N1为灵感的影子，与它几乎同期的0N1类项目“0xVampire”已经趋近归零，但走到今天，Azuki已经完全以“侧身头像”为源，**开创了独属自己的红豆之路**——\n\n品牌化运作方式、蓝筹中稀缺的亚洲文化、中外受众广泛的日漫画风、设计技术细节兼备的网页设计、不止于虚拟世界的后续文创、路书与合约有迹可循的“$BEAN”代币计划、开创行业新规的合约技术、项目方倡导的“Trust the process”理念，以及上述所有综合吸引而形成的良好社区氛围……\n\n## 逐渐登场的亚洲力量\n\n红豆公售前迅速面世的亚洲项目“Phantabear”已经让NFT世界了解到“中文玩家NFT消费力”，短短2个月，不同ALPHA社区推介内容中“该社区中文玩家较为多”这一评价已从De-buff，变成了中立考量甚至加分项。\n\n无论是机遇还是必然，承载着NFT交易市场重要占比的中文玩家，此时需要一个贴近原生文化、符合个人审美的PFP NFT。\n\n在此之前的“蓝筹”少有明确的亚洲文化属性，一些出现在无聊猿中的日式配件甚至被指摘带有负面指向；而红豆的视觉设计避开了文化冲突，从人物五官到服饰风格，采用接受度广泛的日式动漫画风。\n\n## 审美较高的画风、故事感和延展度俱佳的设定\n\nAzuki的角色设定中有四种不同的“物种”：人类、蓝色、红色、精神；9类“魔法”特征（非官方命名）：闪电、水、地球、火灾、樱花、烟雾、狐火、蝴蝶、萤火虫……\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hS0ruIVoFpX4Ruey7TYQS.jpg?height=1796&width=2882)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wZ7DHFXRN0MjjeLhnfxFq.jpg?height=1794&width=2874)\n\n我们很容易联想到火影、钢炼、鬼灭等知名动漫，任意元素代入这些故事当中都能与之世界观完美融合，并在红豆官方出品的剧集面世之前，给粉丝打开了广阔的想象空间。\n\nNFT世界和潮玩手办中必备的稀有属性，红豆也巧妙拿捏——**金豆子**成为幸运玩家和鲸鱼玩家在眼缘扫货之余的囤货首选。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eG98a3fkdMF4b7XcmIzXx.png?height=1117&width=1856)\n\n丰富、有趣的配饰——副手中的法术、武器、旗帜、音箱，配件中的耳机、发饰，不同的帽衫、和服……配饰创作与角色设定结合，猜测这些元素并非完全的随机组合，而是精心创作后的有机选择，每一张JPG似乎因此有了**全新生命和专属故事感**——\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l3fNiMjrw7NSZJW-9wX30.png?height=1173&width=1268)\n\n无论抽到高排名的玩家、还是开到地板的非酋，都能持有自己豆子，“进入红豆宇宙”。\n\n这甚至给了社区成员**进行二创的基底**，我们浏览社区和推特，或许已经见过这些以自己豆子为原型或官方稀有角色为剧情中心创作的“同人作品”（红豆前的大割项目阿尼也有很多写给自己藏品的故事，大多来自中文玩家）。\n\n![Dis频道里有不少优秀的二创](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Xxl9T0RCR7lX7n9etv9t.png?height=396&width=758)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CRXTQJfZHsA2VulZ2cuwv.png?height=783&width=540)\n\nfan-art原创音乐：<https://twitter.com/azukimv3/status/1493879647431397376?s=21>\n\n一张**小图片因此复活**，不再仅仅只是知名合集中万分之一的组件——Azuki成功圈住第一波颜粉。\n\n## 被重视的艺术版块——不仅仅是乙方\n\n红豆的艺术家**不仅仅是“接受委托的乙方”**，这意味着创作者拥有**足够的话语权和自主性**，更愿意在打磨作品上花费时间。\n\n因守望先锋受到关注的**Arnold Tsang**目前已经**全职于Azuki**，作为5名创世团队中唯一实名露面的一员，这对项目方和粉丝来说或许都很重要——平等共事，能够避免一些甲乙双方的永恒存在的矛盾，至少目前我们也不太担心红豆的后续艺术产出会有落差；而有人愿意站到台前，一般都比匿名项目方更加可信。\n\n## 视觉、音乐、网站——高度统一的红豆审美\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5DP_s3O9AR492bnenwlb6.jpg?height=989&width=2060)\n\n官方释出的其他类型作品，都展现了高度统一、风格明确、制作精良的红豆美学——几个官方视频也显示出**成熟的视频/音乐制作水准**。\n\n[https://twitter.com/AzukiZen/status/1468641733210566658?s=20&t=JJCObrPPCETiSFWUWVxKIQ](https://twitter.com/AzukiZen/status/1468641733210566658?s=20&t=JJCObrPPCETiSFWUWVxKIQ)\n\n与其他项目的官网没有太多次级页面不同，Azuki的[官方网站](https://www.azuki.com/)不仅仅是mint的入口，也是**品牌集成中心**——除了常规功能外，我们能清楚了解到项目规划与进程，也能够根据特征检索NFT、验证Holder身份后绑定discord ID……\n\n![集成于官网中的Holder验证界面，成功后还有礼花效果ε(\\*･ω･)_/ﾟ:･☆](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_lgFkR_5xbNkVpVxM6Noq.jpg?height=1288&width=2039)\n\n![类似于交易市场的检索功能](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8o0vMrOMvCwitv4J3ch8Z.png?height=868&width=1840)\n\n## 创始团队——无法忽视的框架搭建者\n\nAzuki当然要往Web3走去，做“去中心化”品牌，但**去中心化是真的不需要Leader吗**？\n\n“DAO的本质上需要优秀的领导者搭建出框架，吸引优秀的成员填充出最终的样子”——搭建框架的人，非常重要。我们从一些细节看到团队做决策的考量——\n\n· Azuki启动之前团队在其他ALpha社区观察成员对Whitelist的讨论，并确定运营逻辑\n\n· 不在参与推文的人中抽白虽然能迅速传播项目，因为不是“坚实的受众”\n\n· 不公开所选中的核心用户推特，以防止骗局DM\n\n· 取消公售，最后17个名额以公平方式在社区分配\n\n· 集成验证holder功能到官网，不直接引用现成机器人\n\n……\n\n## 社群——以“核心文化”留住真正粉丝\n\n红豆社区从一开始就完全**摒弃了“邀请人数和提升等级”来虚张规模**——“真正参与其中”是获得白名单的唯一方式；**“培养真正的核心成员，让豆子缓慢发芽”**，这让社群成员有着较高共识。\n\n没有“邀请拿白制”，所以经历了较长的运营周期后，红豆的discord依旧处于**相对封闭**的状态。\n\n我们能够因此明白，纸面数字增长也许真的意义不大，聚拢有价值的真实玩家更重要。另一条——合理规则带来的自主筛选，而非用技术手段可破解的、用以营造稀缺感的限时开门，一定能够吸引到优质Holder。\n\n令人头疼的是现在很多项目依旧选择discord邀请限时/限量开放等办法，企图规避工作室，而不以相信能够凭借自身洞察与判断以选中优秀的社区成员——这反而很多时候阻拦了粉丝，场外交易已经不止售卖白名单，也开始打包售卖“进门”dis账号。\n\n发售不久前、令人惊叹的fan-art出圈后，豆子才被很多规模化的工作室注意到，此时他们已经少有进入其中的机会。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HzOxw_1ZkauKNodVFC0ds.png?height=498&width=541)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5_O9LrQlVrGqTruUECRhP.png?height=624&width=537)\n\n## 发售方式与开源合约——研磨者、革新者、分享者\n\n不用赘述红豆的合约有多出名——红豆dev改进后推出以极低gas、更快速度完成mint的合约，“革新但不私藏”的做法让它成为“以gas war反映项目热度”行业中的一股清流。\n\n（官方对gas的介绍推文：<https://twitter.com/AzukiZen/status/1479235139167207432?s=20&t=obcIDGbhUxUiTazYosRZzA>）\n\n**分享意味着分利？**\n\n红豆discord中创建了一个频道，以供dev在其中分享和答疑——我们也称之为格局，但“分享精神”是笔者在最初接触加密行业时最为感概的一点。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hyyLdKUeh3YKPYlh1S5Cu.png?height=214&width=1203)\n\n（加密世界很多黑客，但也有很多热心有爱的技术人员——共建社区时“为爱发电”，后续换来项目方的主动给予，“撸毛”行业源于此，也被卡bug于此）\n\n后续不少项目方感谢红豆带来行业革新——作为技术外行对此也非常感慨，它让小资金玩家能省下并不便宜的gas，提升Mint体验——很多前期热度不错、独具风格项目**因技术而被FUD**——白名单无限mint/白名单不能mint/无法承载攻击而发射延迟/前端崩溃合约提前……\n\n此外，红豆的发行逻辑也值得一提（不少其他项目方也采取了类似做法）——\n\n“荷兰拍 → 荷兰拍结束价格的一半进行白名单销售 → 剩余公售（最后17只取消了公售，进行社区内选择）”\n\n常规的“白名单先mint”方式，大概率有着“地板拉高，后续荷兰拍更容易以高价结束”的剧情，但是先进行荷兰拍的方式**更加考验玩家对项目预期和评判**，在没有任何稳定盈利参考的基础上，也能**筛选掉完全不care项目本身的套利者**。\n\n技术让人消落，也助人崛起，行事初衷决定它的走向。\n\n## 未来规划——品牌建设、文创周边、代币经济\n\n路书——告诉别人“卖光后，我们计划怎么办”。\n\n高盈利、高变化的市场，不少项目方mint结束便会另起炉灶开启新一轮收割，这也是很多玩家初评项目需要了解“roadmap”的重要原因，当然编造roadmap也是大割信手拈来的事儿。\n\n近日，Azuki 将碎片化Token#40 (Bobu) ，作为它去中心化治理的尝试，碎片持有人作为dao成员集体治理和决定Bobu IP的未来。\n\n![（官网介绍：https://www.azuki.com/bobu-101#bobu-101）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7krMlSrNIU4HlHmCZk4Sq.png?height=302&width=310)\n\n我们可以在官网中看到，红豆NFT的发行仅仅是它品牌化的第一步——元宇宙3D艺术部署（以鸟屋为特征等日式场景）、实体周边、剧情短片、代币经济或者游戏……\n\n‘Take it slow and stay focused on the long-game.’\n\n很多规划尚未面世，红豆缓步推进蓝图，我们也拭目以待。\n\n引用推特@_Kaspar__的话：\n\n• “到处都是骗局和低质量的项目”\n\n• “找到真正的质量和长期价值变得越来越难”\n\n• “就算你不喜欢红豆，也应该在这其中了解到不错的NFT是什么样子”\n\n## 男豆、女豆——玩家性别比例的真实反应\n\n粉丝愿意换为头像时，项目的地板和成交或许反映了什么——Azuki的男豆地板比女豆要高——当然**不少男性玩家因为某个女豆长得像现/前女友而求购**，但这也非常明确地告诉我们，NFT世界里女性玩家比男性少太多。\n\n与朋友的交流中发现，女性玩家在寻找潜力蓝筹上有着不太相同的取向和见解，但因为技术门槛或者一些环境因素，进入NFT世界女生还太少。自己喜欢的几个活跃的微信群，包括红豆官方中文社区，真实的女性玩家比例也不超过10％。\n\n我们讨论女权，炒作女性艺术家，但是带领女生了解这个领域的人到底多不多呢？\n\n另一点，女性玩家比较少，所以可能少有人提到“饭圈”——**NFT和饭圈非常相似**。\n\n· 项目方、项目本身是明星工作室和面临出道/已经当红的艺人；\n\n· 团队成员找到具有输出能力的核心粉丝成为粉头（MOD）；\n\n· 也有需要对接不同渠道（社区）的运营；\n\n· 少不了与其他艺人（项目合作）联动的CP营销；\n\n· Dis可以理解为超话，一切fan-art都是粉丝产出周边；\n\n· 优秀的fan-art或内推有机会成为后援会会员（Whitelist），获得提前购买官方产品的机会；\n\n· 吃瓜（FUD）过程中也需要带着自己的判断甄别黑料来源、散布者的目的；\n\n· 可以不喜欢但也无需拉踩别的流量，喜欢什么就在有共识的社区（dis、tele、微信群等）圈地自萌、强化信仰。\n\n一切在饭圈行得通的准则这里同样适用，所以必然**只有颜值和实力兼具的流量，才能在尘埃落定后不塌房、成为常青树。**\n\n有人全靠包装和炒作，就有人研磨业务水平；有人利用粉丝经济牟利，就有人因践行正向价值；有人因为Mint了新墙头，也有人觉得自己的朴素豆子香；有红豆这样多维度评价都不错的新星，就让人对一定会出现的下一个优质爱豆充满期待……\n\n## 最后，我们究竟喜欢什么呢？\n\n**我们喜欢被尊重的视觉艺术——**\n\n喜欢红豆中能找到的东方美学共鸣，喜欢画进图里的不敷衍和对持有者的尊重，喜欢1万个角色自带的生命力、故事感，喜欢一张图片带来的广阔想象空间……\n\n**我们喜欢统一而高标准的品牌化运作方式——**\n\n喜欢它从推特、dis到官网都有着正规军该有的样子，喜欢一切具有红豆审美的推广视频、原创音乐、活动策划，喜欢官网的视觉设计、精心架构和贴心而流畅的实用功能……\n\n**喜欢相对公平和平等的WL选择方式——**\n\n喜欢拒绝以cx和pua来制造热度、虚张规模，喜欢更看重创意和质量的选择；喜欢科学家和工作室难钻空子的规则设计，喜欢决策者以平等的姿态对待粉丝……\n\n**我们喜欢凝聚着创造力的平等社区——**\n\n喜欢友善而热情的交流，喜欢Holder和关注者们创作时的无目的，喜欢有趣有才的甚至比原图更棒的粉丝艺术，喜欢分享作品后收到的真诚鼓励和赞扬；\n\n**我们喜欢决心驶向广袤也踏实做事的项目方——**\n\n喜欢Azuki诞生之际就有着深远的考量，喜欢团队践行了他们“Trust the

Mt's will re-define your social relationship graph. Mt's image tells us that when we started to enter the crypto world, many people are the watchers, they were or surprised, or skeptical, or excited, or afraid. However, as an objective rule, the arrival of anything new alway create chaos, some won, some lost, some waited and waited.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0AmbCbCggDrMmh6nH_Zvh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n### Participation\n\nMt's are issued in 12600 pieces. Every Mt's has its unique characteristics and rarity. Mt's will help you realize your social value, allowing you to gain fun and income from your social connections and behavior. Mt's wants to flip the NFT market with new form of energy. NFT shall not be the chips in the hand of the rich, at least that’s not Mt’s. Mt’s owners help each other in a way that no one has ever done.\n\nMt's will issue the first 50 pieces as the seed, half of which will be given as Whitelist to those who have participated and contributed in Mt’s early stages, the other half goes to the first official mint pool where everyone can participate.\n\nTo obtain the first 50 Mt’s are required to go to Mt’s website, log into personal page for the Invitation Code(IC). ICs are the permission to participate mint. Make sure IC in the pocket prior to each mint round.\n\nMt's mint uses an incremental model with an initial price of 0.09 ETH.  Totally 6\\*round mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kiQWX7xPDP5Em54uLfSrV.png?height=1434&width=2794)\n\n## Beyond the PFPs, go ride with mtier!\n\n### Mtier Rank Program\n\nIn order to promote Mt’s influence and build solid relationship among members, Mt’s has its unique incentive program, the Mtier Rank Program(MRP). Once user own Mt’s NFT, he/she becomes a mtier Noob. After completing 2\\*invites and both invitees successful mint Mt’s, mtier Noob go to the rank, the MRP automatically kicks in.\n\nEach mtier has his/her rank(except the Noob), ranks come with different allowances. \n MRP reward is made of two parts: Share reward and Royalties. \n Share reward is an invitation-oriented incentive.\n\n**i.g.** \n Mtier1 invites 2\\*mtier2 and both mtier2 sucessfully mint Mt’s NFT, mtier1 will gain 24% share reward from mtier2’s mint costs.  If mtier2 has his/her own 2\\*mtier3 minted Mt’s NFT, mtier2 will gain 24% share reward from mtier3’s mint costs, meanwhile mtier1 gains 12%  share reward from mtier3’s mint costs.\n\nAlso mtiers will gain 10% of the royalties when their Mt’s NFT in Opensea, etc. \n The specific allowance rate chart shows as following:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5jLNtGnQ7MdFkIxiQH2xx.png?height=1645&width=3761)\n\n### Funds Allocation\n\n**All mint funds will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 50.87% will go to Mtier Rank Program.  \n 24.13% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 25% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**Royalty income will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 2.49% will be awarded to all users holding NFT and participating in the invitation. \n 3% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 4.45% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**The Mt’s Community Treasury:**  \n 20% of the Foundation's funds will be used for acquisitions and marketing. \n 80% will be reserved for bonuses.\n\n\\*When only 5% of total market Mt's NFT are remained, all bonuses will be shared equally.\n\n### Mt's DAO\n\nAll users holding Mt's NFT are members of Mt's DAO. Mt's DAO members can vote in project decisions and can decide how to use bonuses and whether to acquire new NFTs. Mt's DAO will in future be involved and influence the development of Mt's NFT as the core decision maker of Mt's NFT.\n\n### Reward collection\n\nThe mtier who have activated the rewards, can collect them on Mt’s official website. In order to better motivate new comer, Mt's NFT has been reorganized on the collection mechanism-all Mt's NFT that has collected rewards will be automatically destroyed. This deflation mechanism can increase the value of retained Mt 's NFT. After destruction, designated mtier will receive a new vMt's NFT as a credential to record your existing social network.\n\n### vMt's NFT Function\n\nvMt's NFT is a derivative NFT after the original Mt's NFT is destroyed. 20% of vMt's NFT will be used as the seed for the next project and the rest can be redeemed for future CON LAB new projects. Holding vMt's NFT will also continue to maintain your existing social connections, meaning you will continue to increase the value  your social connections. Further more, Holding vMt's NFT will also give you the opportunity to receive token airdrops.\n\n### Mt's redefines NFT\n\n\"The next era will be defined by today's social networking sites and the depth of connection given to users, and our job is to find the best way for users to share themselves\" - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nThe value of relationships is based on the sharing economy, which means sharing one's state of being, one's information, one's interests, one's hobbies. The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing. Mt’s aims to build a perpetual social-fi  generator in Web3.\n\nThe CON LAB will create a decentralized NFT trading platform driven by influencers and the community through a perpetual network of social connections, with the proceeds of each transaction distributed to the platform's NFT holders to enjoy perpetual dividends and a true return of equity to the user.\n\n## What is Mt's\n\n***The Made-it's , The Miss-it's, The My-turn's!***\n\nThis was a great movement that will eventually be remembered in crypto history. Free from the interference of capitals and authorities. There are no losers in this movement.\n\nThis time we are not a bystander, we are expressing our emotions in a way that will influence more crypto practitioners.\n\nFrom this moment on, Mt's will change the world.\n\n### Follow Mt’s\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MtsNFTs)    |    [Disocrd](https://discord.gg/TK3VCgH4pR)    |    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUahYxfJ2xaB9W9js3ifWQ)\n\n## Don't wait&see, up with Mt’s.", "timestamp": 1653374171, "digest": "vyA5575rvQ7kbqkumCcLLXqMptIBWzFhFzwE4MfQexc", "contributor": "0x5b23A5d907805a4dcFBe13aE232442A6746c5C9C"}

{"id": "uU-91NL5goQ_OEwXeZo46Mom-LiaclWuM5yEV-YGfEI", "title": "区块链的工作原理及其可能对世界带来的影响", "body": "我們經常聽到區塊鏈這個概念，但是很少有人知道它到底是什麼，它的工作原理，以及它能造成什麼影響。紐約大學Stern商學院的David Yermack發表於Review of Finance的論文《[公司治理與區塊鏈](https://academic.oup.com/rof/article/doi/10.1093/rof/rfw074/2888422/Corporate-Governance-and-Blockchains)》，是一篇很到位的科普文，它從非技術性角度清晰地回答了上述問題。以下只是不完整的概述，我強烈推薦各位閱讀完整的論文。\n\n**區塊鍊是什麼？**\n\n一個區塊鍊是一個信息的數據庫，用來儲存不經任何篡改的交易記錄。這些記錄可能包括了資產（股票、債券、房地產、汽車、藝術品）的所有權、出生證明、駕照，以及已投的選票。區塊鏈最為人知的功能是儲存了比特幣的所有權記錄，但是它的潛在應用範圍遠比這要廣泛。和目前的記錄儲存方式相比，區塊鏈有三個主要優勢：\n\n* 成本。交易記錄可以被自動更新，節省了諸如投票計票，或者請律師變更土地所有權一類的開支。\n* 迅速。交易記錄幾乎可以做到實時更新。相反，一個公司的賬戶也許每年只更新一次，並且投票的統計也需要時間。\n* 數據完整性。土地信息可能被篡改，公司損益表可以被操縱，期權可以回溯，但區塊鏈中的數據卻沒有人能夠更改。\n\n**區塊鏈的工作原理**\n\n一個區塊就是記錄的一個集合。比如，一個比特幣區塊包含了在10分鐘內（上圖中的Merkle根（或Tx_Root））發生的所有比特幣交易；每筆交易的記錄包含時間、發送者、接收者，以及該筆交易的比特幣數量。時間戳記錄該區塊的創建時間。\n\n一個區塊鏈由一系列的區塊構成，這些區塊被一個哈希函數（散列函數）連接起來。哈希函數是一種將數據轉換成一個十六進制編碼的密碼學，這些編碼不能倒回去重現原始輸入值。區塊12的頭部包含有反映區塊11內容的哈希函數，區塊11的頭部又有反映區塊10的內容的哈希函數，以此類推。這樣一來，要在前面的一個區塊上造假就是不可能的，因為這將會導致之後的所有區塊的哈希值都發生變化，因此這種造假就很會容易被察覺。若有人想要篡改歷史交易，那麼他/她就不得不為後續所有的區塊重新找到有效的哈希值。\n\n市場中任何一個參與者都可以更新一個公開區塊鏈的信息——沒有中心化的權威機構（不同於有土地註冊處在管理土地所有權）。要創建區塊13，一個參與者必須將新一筆交易的數據（並沒有被包含在之前的任何區塊裡）和區塊12的哈希值、時間戳，以及一個隨機數拼接在一起。一個隨機數就是和區塊中的其他信息結合在一起能夠生成一個新哈希值的隨機數字。有效的哈希值必須在某個範圍內，比如，必須有幾個零開頭。一個參與者需要不斷試錯，通過找到一個滿足要求的隨機數來生成區塊13對應的哈希值。一旦有一個參與者率先成功了，其他成員會檢驗並承認區塊13已經完成，然後去計算區塊14。\n\n這個勝出的參與者會得到12.5個比特幣的獎勵（在比特幣區塊鏈裡）；因此，這些有可能獲得獎勵的參與者就是我們所稱的礦工。這個獎勵鼓勵礦工將新交易拼接起來並建立新的區塊——這其實就是記賬服務費。礦工選擇他們想要包含在新區塊裡的任何交易，並對其進行編碼；一般不會有兩個礦工選中一模一樣的交易組合。想要迅速獲得交易證明的代理人，可以自願付給將其交易成功編入下個區塊的礦工一筆費用（作為激勵）。\n\n這篇論文也介紹了私有和許可區塊鏈。在兩種區塊鏈裡，記錄的更新是由一方或一個小組（由多方組成）來完成的。對這些區塊鏈的監管本身又是另一個很有意思的議題，那篇論文同樣也有提到。\n\n**區塊鏈會如何影響現實世界？**\n\n最有意思的是這篇論文關於區塊鏈潛在的變革性影響力的討論。\n\n* 所有權透明度增加。交易記錄將會即刻對每個人可見。目前，在美國，機構投資者頭寸的13F報告每季度只發布一次。此外，公司有三種不同的股東名單（公司、交易所、代理投票）；公司往往並不知道他們真正的股東是誰。\n  * 透明度可以讓投資者很難做到獲得一個區塊而不改變股價，這樣就會加重Grossman和Hart在1980年提出的搭便車問題（Kyle and Vila (1991)）。\n\n\n  * 透明度能夠阻止內部交易，並且相反會鼓勵外界獲得信息（Fishman and Hagerty (1992), Bushman, Piotoski, and Smith (2005)）。它同樣會使期權獎勵或者其他任何金融交易回溯的情況變為不可能。（Fishman and Hagerty (1992), Bushman, Piotoski, and Smith (2005)）\n* 更強的流動性。執行和完成股票交易可以更加迅速實惠。在美國，目前的結算往往需要3天時間並有多方介入才能完成。\n  * 流動性可以加強股東通過行使發言權（請見Maug (1998) 和Kahn and Winton (1998)的模型，及Norli, Ostergaard, and Schindele (2015)提出的證據）和退出投資（請見Admati and Pfleiderer (2009) 和Edmans (2009)的模型，及Edmans, Fang, and Zur (2013)，還有Roosenboom, Schlingemann, and Vasconcelos (2014)提出的證據）實現的公司治理。\n\n\n  * 不僅是活躍的股東，普通人也可以從中受益。目前，從蘇黎世匯款到紐約手續費是7%並且需要花3天時間。\n* 投票。區塊鏈可以用來記錄公司選舉的投票。這將會提高選舉準確性，並且化解關於管理層通過幕後操縱贏得絕大多數投票結果非常接近的選舉的顧慮。由於股票的借貸將會變得透明，區塊鏈同時也會讓空洞投票（模型搭建於Brav and Mathews (2011), 實證研究於Hu and Black (2006) 和Christoffersen, Geczy, Musto, and Reed (2007)）變得更難。\n* 實時記賬。一個公司可以在區塊鏈上發布其所有的商業交易，讓任何人在任何時候都可以合計出他們的損益表和資產負債表。這可以大大地減少對審計員的需求、防止應計盈餘管理、阻止關聯方交易。\n* 智能合約。智能合約是一種自動執行合約的方式：比如，如果借款人車貸違約，那麼無人駕駛汽車可以自己開回銀行。區塊鏈可以很低廉地執行智能合約，比如一違約就改變抵押物的所有權。這從根本上減少了強制執行的成本。金融學教授們以後可能就再也沒法寫關於扣押抵押品的難點的論文了！\n\n**這只是一個白日夢嗎？**\n\n許多革命性的科技都只是曇花一現，但有的卻真的帶來了變革性的影響。區塊鏈會不負眾望嗎？2016年的三個比較突出的活動表明了它也許可以。\n\n* 澳大利亞證券交易所公佈了一項計劃，該計劃準備使用區塊鏈技術來重新設計其清算和結算系統，其他許多主要證券市場也開展了探索性的項目。\n* 納斯達克證券交易所公佈了一個在股東會議上利用區塊鏈平台進行投票的試點計劃。管理幾乎所有美國大選計票工作的私企Broadridge開始下大力氣做相關研究，準備在美國公司選舉投票中使用區塊鏈。\n\n美國上市公司Overstock.com於2016年11月在一個區塊鏈上發行了股票，這樣他們雖然在監管機構處註冊了股份，但並沒有經過傳統的證券交易所。", "timestamp": 1653374266, "digest": "Yt7-Sk0HanUf_G7xB2PGu8b3XeboHg4wQr0X7rFE51A", "contributor": "0x91e41069F5300128bbdeed94659A3Fe28499FF1E"}

逐渐登场的亚洲力量\n\n红豆公售前迅速面世的亚洲项目“Phantabear”已经让NFT世界了解到“中文玩家NFT消费力”，短短2个月，不同ALPHA社区推介内容中“该社区中文玩家较为多”这一评价已从De-buff，变成了中立考量甚至加分项。\n\n无论是机遇还是必然，承载着NFT交易市场重要占比的中文玩家，此时需要一个贴近原生文化、符合个人审美的PFP NFT。\n\n在此之前的“蓝筹”少有明确的亚洲文化属性，一些出现在无聊猿中的日式配件甚至被指摘带有负面指向；而红豆的视觉设计避开了文化冲突，从人物五官到服饰风格，采用接受度广泛的日式动漫画风。\n\n##

Azuki启动之前团队在其他ALpha社区观察成员对Whitelist的讨论，并确定运营逻辑\n\n· 不在参与推文的人中抽白虽然能迅速传播项目，因为不是“坚实的受众”\n\n· 不公开所选中的核心用户推特，以防止骗局DM\n\n· 取消公售，最后17个名额以公平方式在社区分配\n\n· 集成验证holder功能到官网，不直接引用现成机器人\n\n……\n\n## 社群——以“核心文化”留住真正粉丝\n\n红豆社区从一开始就完全**摒弃了“邀请人数和提升等级”来虚张规模**——“真正参与其中”是获得白名单的唯一方式；**“培养真正的核心成员，让豆子缓慢发芽”**，这让社群成员有着较高共识。\n\n没有“邀请拿白制”，所以经历了较长的运营周期后，红豆的discord依旧处于**相对封闭**的状态。\n\n我们能够因此明白，纸面数字增长也许真的意义不大，聚拢有价值的真实玩家更重要。另一条——合理规则带来的自主筛选，而非用技术手段可破解的、用以营造稀缺感的限时开门，一定能够吸引到优质Holder。\n\n令人头疼的是现在很多项目依旧选择discord邀请限时/限量开放等办法，企图规避工作室，而不以相信能够凭借自身洞察与判断以选中优秀的社区成员——这反而很多时候阻拦了粉丝，场外交易已经不止售卖白名单，也开始打包售卖“进门”dis账号。\n\n发售不久前、令人惊叹的fan-art出圈后，豆子才被很多规模化的工作室注意到，此时他们已经少有进入其中的机会。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HzOxw_1ZkauKNodVFC0ds.png?height=498&width=541)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5_O9LrQlVrGqTruUECRhP.png?height=624&width=537)\n\n## 发售方式与开源合约——研磨者、革新者、分享者\n\n不用赘述红豆的合约有多出名——红豆dev改进后推出以极低gas、更快速度完成mint的合约，“革新但不私藏”的做法让它成为“以gas war反映项目热度”行业中的一股清流。\n\n（官方对gas的介绍推文：<https://twitter.com/AzukiZen/status/1479235139167207432?s=20&t=obcIDGbhUxUiTazYosRZzA>）\n\n**分享意味着分利？**\n\n红豆discord中创建了一个频道，以供dev在其中分享和答疑——我们也称之为格局，但“分享精神”是笔者在最初接触加密行业时最为感概的一点。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hyyLdKUeh3YKPYlh1S5Cu.png?height=214&width=1203)\n\n（加密世界很多黑客，但也有很多热心有爱的技术人员——共建社区时“为爱发电”，后续换来项目方的主动给予，“撸毛”行业源于此，也被卡bug于此）\n\n后续不少项目方感谢红豆带来行业革新——作为技术外行对此也非常感慨，它让小资金玩家能省下并不便宜的gas，提升Mint体验——很多前期热度不错、独具风格项目**因技术而被FUD**——白名单无限mint/白名单不能mint/无法承载攻击而发射延迟/前端崩溃合约提前……\n\n此外，红豆的发行逻辑也值得一提（不少其他项目方也采取了类似做法）——\n\n“荷兰拍 → 荷兰拍结束价格的一半进行白名单销售 → 剩余公售（最后17只取消了公售，进行社区内选择）”\n\n常规的“白名单先mint”方式，大概率有着“地板拉高，后续荷兰拍更容易以高价结束”的剧情，但是先进行荷兰拍的方式**更加考验玩家对项目预期和评判**，在没有任何稳定盈利参考的基础上，也能**筛选掉完全不care项目本身的套利者**。\n\n技术让人消落，也助人崛起，行事初衷决定它的走向。\n\n## 未来规划——品牌建设、文创周边、代币经济\n\n路书——告诉别人“卖光后，我们计划怎么办”。\n\n高盈利、高变化的市场，不少项目方mint结束便会另起炉灶开启新一轮收割，这也是很多玩家初评项目需要了解“roadmap”的重要原因，当然编造roadmap也是大割信手拈来的事儿。\n\n近日，Azuki 将碎片化Token#40 (Bobu) ，作为它去中心化治理的尝试，碎片持有人作为dao成员集体治理和决定Bobu IP的未来。\n\n![（官网介绍：https://www.azuki.com/bobu-101#bobu-101）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7krMlSrNIU4HlHmCZk4Sq.png?height=302&width=310)\n\n我们可以在官网中看到，红豆NFT的发行仅仅是它品牌化的第一步——元宇宙3D艺术部署（以鸟屋为特征等日式场景）、实体周边、剧情短片、代币经济或者游戏……\n\n‘Take it slow and stay focused on the long-game.’\n\n很多规划尚未面世，红豆缓步推进蓝图，我们也拭目以待。\n\n引用推特@_Kaspar__的话：\n\n• “到处都是骗局和低质量的项目”\n\n• “找到真正的质量和长期价值变得越来越难”\n\n• “就算你不喜欢红豆，也应该在这其中了解到不错的NFT是什么样子”\n\n## 男豆、女豆——玩家性别比例的真实反应\n\n粉丝愿意换为头像时，项目的地板和成交或许反映了什么——Azuki的男豆地板比女豆要高——当然**不少男性玩家因为某个女豆长得像现/前女友而求购**，但这也非常明确地告诉我们，NFT世界里女性玩家比男性少太多。\n\n与朋友的交流中发现，女性玩家在寻找潜力蓝筹上有着不太相同的取向和见解，但因为技术门槛或者一些环境因素，进入NFT世界女生还太少。自己喜欢的几个活跃的微信群，包括红豆官方中文社区，真实的女性玩家比例也不超过10％。\n\n我们讨论女权，炒作女性艺术家，但是带领女生了解这个领域的人到底多不多呢？\n\n另一点，女性玩家比较少，所以可能少有人提到“饭圈”——**NFT和饭圈非常相似**。\n\n· 项目方、项目本身是明星工作室和面临出道/已经当红的艺人；\n\n· 团队成员找到具有输出能力的核心粉丝成为粉头（MOD）；\n\n· 也有需要对接不同渠道（社区）的运营；\n\n· 少不了与其他艺人（项目合作）联动的CP营销；\n\n· Dis可以理解为超话，一切fan-art都是粉丝产出周边；\n\n· 优秀的fan-art或内推有机会成为后援会会员（Whitelist），获得提前购买官方产品的机会；\n\n· 吃瓜（FUD）过程中也需要带着自己的判断甄别黑料来源、散布者的目的；\n\n· 可以不喜欢但也无需拉踩别的流量，喜欢什么就在有共识的社区（dis、tele、微信群等）圈地自萌、强化信仰。\n\n一切在饭圈行得通的准则这里同样适用，所以必然**只有颜值和实力兼具的流量，才能在尘埃落定后不塌房、成为常青树。**\n\n有人全靠包装和炒作，就有人研磨业务水平；有人利用粉丝经济牟利，就有人因践行正向价值；有人因为Mint了新墙头，也有人觉得自己的朴素豆子香；有红豆这样多维度评价都不错的新星，就让人对一定会出现的下一个优质爱豆充满期待……\n\n## 最后，我们究竟喜欢什么呢？\n\n**我们喜欢被尊重的视觉艺术——**\n\n喜欢红豆中能找到的东方美学共鸣，喜欢画进图里的不敷衍和对持有者的尊重，喜欢1万个角色自带的生命力、故事感，喜欢一张图片带来的广阔想象空间……\n\n**我们喜欢统一而高标准的品牌化运作方式——**\n\n喜欢它从推特、dis到官网都有着正规军该有的样子，喜欢一切具有红豆审美的推广视频、原创音乐、活动策划，喜欢官网的视觉设计、精心架构和贴心而流畅的实用功能……\n\n**喜欢相对公平和平等的WL选择方式——**\n\n喜欢拒绝以cx和pua来制造热度、虚张规模，喜欢更看重创意和质量的选择；喜欢科学家和工作室难钻空子的规则设计，喜欢决策者以平等的姿态对待粉丝……\n\n**我们喜欢凝聚着创造力的平等社区——**\n\n喜欢友善而热情的交流，喜欢Holder和关注者们创作时的无目的，喜欢有趣有才的甚至比原图更棒的粉丝艺术，喜欢分享作品后收到的真诚鼓励和赞扬；\n\n**我们喜欢决心驶向广袤也踏实做事的项目方——**\n\n喜欢Azuki诞生之际就有着深远的考量，喜欢团队践行了他们“Trust the process”的理念；喜欢决策者认真对待每一个细节、尊重社区；喜欢他们继续吸纳力量，扩充成员……\n\n**喜欢革新体验、能力与责任兼具的技术——**\n\n喜欢红豆dev创新了721a合约；喜欢项目方做足功课、拒绝甩锅、以技术实力制定了行业新标；喜欢他们极具区块链精神的分享；喜欢他们考虑用户的初衷……\n\n**我们喜欢可期盼、也可执行的蓝图——**\n\n喜欢没有人许下浮夸又笃定承诺，喜欢一切有迹可循的进程，喜欢即将到来的去中心化治理尝试，喜欢不久后即将上线的文创周边和元宇宙布局……\n\n**我们喜欢美，喜欢收藏美——视觉、音乐、价值、氛围……**\n\n我们希望在收藏美的同时盈利，但最终期望拥有的，也许只是能在其中获得认可和荣誉感的自己。\n\n部分资料来源——\n\n推特用户：[@locationtba](https://twitter.com/locationtba)

BTC大级别（三角）是突破，按理小级别应该服从大级别，2小时级别突破了，15分钟的回踩应该不会很强。\n\n \n\n1. 此时我手里的ENS、KSM、KAVA都已陆续突破，盈利比较可观。大量山寨构筑强烈的向上预期，我希望抗一抗波动。\n\n \n\n1. 前天的那个楔形转头肩顶转三角突破的案例就在不远，我认为当前情况下这次的楔形也有概率这么走。\n\n \n\n**直到这个时候，我认为我的操作和思路都没有什么太大错误。**\n\n \n\n**到了晚上，美股开盘，大饼却莫名的快速下杀然后V反。**\n\n \n\n**正好构筑了一个头肩顶，其实如果是一个更成熟的交易者这种结构应该走了。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ev3qUq8KhARjNSgfR_Tub.png?height=748&width=1400)\n\n 但是我却没走，我的逻辑同样有3点：\n\n \n\n1. 先前那波下杀正好完成二探回踩，我认为很健康。\n\n \n\n1. 美股没有跌，反而高开。\n\n \n\n1. 和之前一样，认为小级别要服从大级别；且这里可能做一个图表转换，构筑个上涨中继。\n\n \n\n**这个逻辑我现在看来同样没问题，我如果此时走还能有一点利润，后面的操作才是我亏损的最直接原因。**\n\n \n\nBTC构筑完头肩顶后又再次快速下破，甚至跌破了三角的上边界，这个时候没有理由不跑，我却在下方不断的画支撑位，希望在某一个点被支撑柱并开启反弹。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RVoYsSE1SuYjjL-38Swes.png?height=566&width=1400)\n\n事实证明我错了，最后是一路下杀，无视一切支撑，直接跌穿到三角的下边界。我昨天的操作以严重亏损结局。\n\n \n\n**事后来看，前期都一切顺利，但是当行情走势和我预期有偏差时，我开始不断犯错：**\n\n \n\n1. **过分解读行情。当行情和预期不一致就开始不断找其他的可能性，试图让行情走势重新回到我的预期当中。**\n\n \n\n1. **没有交易纪律。做的是图表，当图表走坏了就应该无条件离场，我却心存侥幸，认为自己手里拿的现货不会出现爆仓，不愿意止损。**\n\n \n\n虽然这次我都是现货，不会爆仓。并且大饼是大仓位，山寨是小仓位，但是明明我可以做的更好。\n\n \n\n盈利的时候到边界为什么不主动止盈？盈利变亏损的时候我为什么还一直心存侥幸？我的交易心态还需要磨练。", "timestamp": 1653374386, "digest": "4tBpCgR8DVmB5kT5cgyjBDALO03sl2v58FsnXOj2S-M", "contributor": "0xB2f362e3296A6d88E9a46FA733D18EC319494819"}

Mt's will re-define your social relationship graph. Mt's image tells us that when we started to enter the crypto world, many people are the watchers, they were or surprised, or skeptical, or excited, or afraid. However, as an objective rule, the arrival of anything new alway create chaos, some won, some lost, some waited and waited.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0AmbCbCggDrMmh6nH_Zvh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n### Participation\n\n**Mt's are issued in 12600 pieces.** Every Mt's has its unique characteristics and rarity. Mt's will help you realize your social value, allowing you to gain fun and income from your social connections and behavior. Mt's wants to flip the NFT market with new form of energy. NFT shall not be the chips in the hand of the rich, at least that’s not Mt’s. Mt’s owners help each other in a way that no one has ever done.\n\n**Mt's will issue the first 50 pieces as the seed, half of which will be given as Whitelist to those who have participated and contributed in Mt’s early stages, the other half goes to the first official mint pool where everyone can participate.**\n\nTo obtain the first 50 Mt’s are required to go to Mt’s website, log into personal page for the Invitation Code(IC). ICs are the permission to participate mint. Make sure IC in the pocket prior to each mint round.\n\n**Mt's mint uses an incremental model with an initial price of 0.09 ETH.**  \n\n![Totally 6\\*round mint](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kiQWX7xPDP5Em54uLfSrV.png?height=1434&width=2794)\n\n## Beyond the PFPs, go ride with mtier!\n\n### Mtier Rank Program\n\nIn order to promote Mt’s influence and build solid relationship among members, Mt’s has its unique incentive program, the Mtier Rank Program(MRP). Once user own Mt’s NFT, he/she becomes a mtier Noob. After completing 2\\*invites and both invitees successful mint Mt’s, mtier Noob go to the rank, the MRP automatically kicks in.\n\nEach mtier has his/her rank(except the Noob), ranks come with different allowances. \n MRP reward is made of two parts: Share reward and Royalties. \n Share reward is an invitation-oriented incentive.\n\n**i.g.** \n Mtier1 invites 2\\*mtier2 and both mtier2 sucessfully mint Mt’s NFT, mtier1 will gain 24% share reward from mtier2’s mint costs.   \n If mtier2 has his/her own 2\\*mtier3 minted Mt’s NFT, mtier2 will gain 24% share reward from mtier3’s mint costs, meanwhile mtier1 gains 12%  share reward from mtier3’s mint costs.\n\nAlso mtiers will gain 10% of the royalties when their Mt’s NFT in Opensea, etc. \n The specific allowance rate chart shows as following:\n\n![The specific allowance rate chart](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5jLNtGnQ7MdFkIxiQH2xx.png?height=1645&width=3761)\n\n### Funds Allocation\n\n**All mint funds will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 50.87% will go to Mtier Rank Program.  \n 24.13% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 25% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**Royalty income will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 2.49% will be awarded to all users holding NFT and participating in the invitation. \n 3% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 4.45% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**The Mt’s Community Treasury:**  \n 20% of the Foundation's funds will be used for acquisitions and marketing. \n 80% will be reserved for bonuses.\n\n\\*When only 5% of total market Mt's NFT are remained, all bonuses will be shared equally.\n\n### Mt's DAO\n\nAll users holding Mt's NFT are members of Mt's DAO. Mt's DAO members can vote in project decisions and can decide how to use bonuses and whether to acquire new NFTs. Mt's DAO will in future be involved and influence the development of Mt's NFT as the core decision maker of Mt's NFT.\n\n### Reward collection\n\nThe mtier who have activated the rewards, can collect them on Mt’s official website. In order to better motivate new comer, Mt's NFT has been reorganized on the collection mechanism-all Mt's NFT that has collected rewards will be automatically destroyed. This deflation mechanism can increase the value of retained Mt 's NFT. After destruction, designated mtier will receive a new vMt's NFT as a credential to record your existing social network.\n\n### vMt's NFT Function\n\nvMt's NFT is a derivative NFT after the original Mt's NFT is destroyed. 20% of vMt's NFT will be used as the seed for the next project and the rest can be redeemed for future CON LAB new projects. Holding vMt's NFT will also continue to maintain your existing social connections, meaning you will continue to increase the value  your social connections. Further more, Holding vMt's NFT will also give you the opportunity to receive token airdrops.\n\n### Mt's redefines NFT\n\n\"The next era will be defined by today's social networking sites and the depth of connection given to users, and our job is to find the best way for users to share themselves\" - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nThe value of relationships is based on the sharing economy, which means sharing one's state of being, one's information, one's interests, one's hobbies. The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing. Mt’s aims to build a perpetual social-fi  generator in Web3.\n\nThe CON LAB will create a decentralized NFT trading platform driven by influencers and the community through a perpetual network of social connections, with the proceeds of each transaction distributed to the platform's NFT holders to enjoy perpetual dividends and a true return of equity to the user.\n\n## What is Mt's\n\n***The Made-it's , The Miss-it's, The My-turn's!***\n\nThis was a great movement that will eventually be remembered in crypto history. Free from the interference of capitals and authorities. There are no losers in this movement.\n\nThis time we are not a bystander, we are expressing our emotions in a way that will influence more crypto practitioners.\n\nFrom this moment on, Mt's will change the world.\n\n### Follow Mt’s\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MtsNFTs)    |    [Disocrd](https://discord.gg/TK3VCgH4pR)    |    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUahYxfJ2xaB9W9js3ifWQ)\n\n## Don't wait&see, up with Mt’s.", "timestamp": 1653374712, "digest": "vyA5575rvQ7kbqkumCcLLXqMptIBWzFhFzwE4MfQexc", "contributor": "0x5b23A5d907805a4dcFBe13aE232442A6746c5C9C"}

{"id": "UqIyN26vJmursQ9uPNHRYtIJEPY-4QFfVP6YZ9owp94", "title": "The Stargate Omnichain mission", "body": "Hello earthlings!\n\nIt's no longer news about the first omnichain Fungible token: [Stargate finance](https://stargate.finance/), which is built on [LayerZero protocol.](https://layerzero.network/)                                                                                               The Omnichain Fungible token (OFT) title, was derived from its mobility on chain i.e.  the ability of $STG to move freely between all chains Layer zero exists.\n\n   This was made possible by solving the Bridging Trilemma, via **the *Delta (Δ)* algorithm**.\n\n[Ryan Zarick](https://twitter.com/ryanzarick?lang=en), co-founder and CTO of LayerZero outlined in indepth in the [Bridging Trilemma](https://medium.com/stargate-official/the-bridging-trilemma-d80788cce4ef).\n\n##             Introducing the Delta (Δ) algorithm.\n\n The *Delta (Δ)*  algorithm is a novel resource balancing algorithm that enables *unified native asset pools* on all chains while also providing *Instant Guaranteed Finality.*\n\n *Delta (Δ) algorithm* ticked all three boxes in the Bridging Trilemma and proved to be the first algorithm with attractive features capable of an ideal bridge.\n\nThe effect of this solution encompasses many on-chain activities.                               This is a modification to the  **lock + mint + Redeem**  mechanism of synthetic assets which can induce fragmented liquidity.\n\n With bridging trilemma solved, we can now simultaneously have deep pools of native assets tied to all chains, creating orders of magnitude greater capital efficiency.         LPs will be able to stake into a singled-sided asset pool with no impermanent loss and collect fees from all incoming transfers regardless of their source chain. This would save users the time and fees needed to swap out undesirable synthetics on the destination chain or have a scenario where a transfer fails due to state change.\n\n##                The fundamental security limit of bridges.\n\nGenerally, there are different perspectives to an ideal bridge either via “multi-chain” or “cross-chain” but both are limited to some fundamental securities which have proven to be honeypots for exploits.\n\nThese different perspectives steered up some healthy argument as [Vitalik](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin), co-founder of Ethereum blockchain remains optimistic about a multi-chain blockchain ecosystem rather than cross-chain applications.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uGoVsCU_R0fOfbW29FKXY.png?height=562&width=582)\n\nHowever, instead of fighting over influence on the mutual goal which is “The fundamental security”. We can as well derive means/protocols to mitigate the risks to the barest minimum.\n\nFollowing his argument tweet, he also acknowledged the quality of cross-rollup apps within “one zone of sovereignty”. Noting that, it is also a limit to the \"modular blockchains\" vision.  The key word “one zone of sovereignty”, Could this be Stargate on [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) ?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M7zDmYv1avOX68EsLN7Ch.png?height=276&width=596)\n\nWhat if we can limit these risks, by getting the roll-ups within one zone of sovereignty like he said. Seems like a blockchain myth, How’s that possible ?   \n\nThink of an interoperable Omnichain protocol, leveraging on the security properties of Chainlink and Band oracles. Yes, that's [Layer zero](https://layerzero.network/); the skeleton framework of Stargate.         Ryan Zarick, explained how the interoperability works in his post on [LayerZero- An Omnichain Interoperability Protocol](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/layerzero-an-omnichain-interoperability-protocol-b43d2ae975b6)\n\nMeanwhile, Vitalik’s perspective on multichain over cross-chain focuses on ***wrapped assets as the solution.***                                                                                                                                                         The premises of his argument relies on “the limits to the security of bridges that hop across multiple zones of sovereignty”.\n\n##        Mechanism of wrapped assets Vs Stargate cross-chain\n\n There is no doubt that latency has proven to be a function of security and as such, the latent period shouldn’t be subjected to any sort of risk**.**                                              Meanwhile, one of ***the issues of a wrapped asset being the solution- is the risk on the duration of the transaction.***\n\n    To explain this clearly, let's zoom out to the user side:  A user with $1000 Eth on its  native chain A wants the same value of ETH on another chain B.\n\n> ***Using Stargate***: The user deposits hid preferred ETH value on chain A and gets out the same equivalent value of Eth in his preferred currency on his preferred chain.  Everything happens immediately, Bridge did its job and you have your cryptocurrency on your desired chain.\n\n  In a case of an uncertainty or dilemma where stargate is subjected to an exploit and probably goes to zero, You're all out in safe hands.\n\n> ***Using a wrapped asset*** : The user locks up the $1000 Eth on chain A and mints the equivalent value of synthetic Eth value on chain B.                                                         This transaction is not yet complete as long as the value of ETH on chain B is subjected to the risk of its equivalent value of Eth on chain A.\n\nIn a case of an uncertainty or dilemma where the original ETH on chain A is removed, then your  Synthetic Eth is now worthless.\n\n##       Wrapped assets and Smart contract risk.\n\nWrapped assets works on a **(lock + mint + redeem)** mechanism and there are multiple angles of attack on smart contracts with this model.                                                     This could be  local smart contract risks, which may include poorly written codes that are vulnerable to exploits and hackers.\n\nLocal smart contract risks can be controlled yet seem inevitable for every smart-contracts.\n\nSeveral Audits can examine and do the best of their job but then there are other two angles of outstanding risk which are inescapable, these risks could be derived from *the validation mechanism and fraudulent messages.*                                                            This can be evident in the recent hack events,  where a hacker stuffs in some sort of false code(fraudulent messages) aiming at either  tricking the source contract to deliver false messages to the destination chain OR by directly tricking the destination chain to automate messages that aren't from the source code.\n\n[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) has always proven to be ahead of the emerging risks with the advent of “stop the hack\" protocol known as **[Pre-crime](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/introducing-pre-crime-49bef4a581d5?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------)**.\n\n##                Introducing Pre-crime\n\nTransport layers are really innocent of the exploits, as most of the catastrophes are smart contract related and has nothing to do with transport layer. Yet these transport layers deliver the final fatality.\n\n End of worries, with the launch ***Pre-crime*** we could prevent the final blow from being delivered.\n\n         Pre-Crime initiates the ability for a relayer to stop a hack before it happens.      This is achieved by forking the destination blockchain before delivering the message and running the transaction locally.                                                                                  Pre-Crime also involves the authentication to check the state of the blockchain in relation to the other connected blockchains to confirm no malicious action occurred. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hb5TBC01De7O_m0ho9pvb.png?height=352&width=704)\n\nYou can read more about the additional layer of security : **[Pre-crime](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/introducing-pre-crime-49bef4a581d5)**.\n\nThis is just one of many steps LayerZero is taking to ensure the security of the omnichain future. \n\nThe ultimate goal of Stargate is to mitigate the risks of cross-chain swaps to the barest minimum. \n\nIn pursuit of this ultimate goal, several other sub-goals have been attained such as : Optimized volume and fees for swaps, transfers and LP.                                             **$STG**, the omnichain fungible token is the rocket science behind all these.\n\n##  What’s Next\n\nThere's a lot going on, such as the Pre-crime, DEX integrations etc.\n\nThe Stargate team also cares about the community and the growth of Stargate protocol. That's why DAO governance is in place. It is vital to bring all forces together to build a strong protocol.            \n\nTo ensure the efficacy of the governance, the community decided to use the Common wealth platform as the Forum that Stargate will be using for Proposals and Governance.\n\nBright minds can now come together, discuss and draft proposals.

After completing 2\\*invites and both invitees successful mint Mt’s, mtier Noob go to the rank, the MRP automatically kicks in.\n\nEach mtier has his/her rank(except the Noob), ranks come with different allowances. \n MRP reward is made of two parts: Share reward and Royalties. \n Share reward is an invitation-oriented incentive.\n\n**i.g.** \n Mtier1 invites 2\\*mtier2 and both mtier2 sucessfully mint Mt’s NFT, mtier1 will gain 24% share reward from mtier2’s mint costs.   \n If mtier2 has his/her own 2\\*mtier3 minted Mt’s NFT, mtier2 will gain 24% share reward from mtier3’s mint costs, meanwhile mtier1 gains 12%  share reward from mtier3’s mint costs.\n\nAlso mtiers will gain 10% of the royalties when their Mt’s NFT in Opensea, etc. \n The specific allowance rate chart shows as following:\n\n![The specific allowance rate chart](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5jLNtGnQ7MdFkIxiQH2xx.png?height=1645&width=3761)\n\n### Funds Allocation\n\n**All mint funds will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 50.87% will go to Mtier Rank Program.  \n 24.13% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 25% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**Royalty income will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 2.49% will be awarded to all users holding NFT and participating in the invitation. \n 3% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 4.45% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**The Mt’s Community Treasury:**  \n 20% of the Foundation's funds will be used for acquisitions and marketing. \n 80% will be reserved for bonuses.\n\n\\*When only 5% of total market Mt's NFT are remained, all bonuses will be shared equally.\n\n### Mt's DAO\n\nAll users holding Mt's NFT are members of Mt's DAO. Mt's DAO members can vote in project decisions and can decide how to use bonuses and whether to acquire new NFTs. Mt's DAO will in future be involved and influence the development of Mt's NFT as the core decision maker of Mt's NFT.\n\n### Reward collection\n\nThe mtier who have activated the rewards, can collect them on Mt’s official website. In order to better motivate new comer, Mt's NFT has been reorganized on the collection mechanism-all Mt's NFT that has collected rewards will be automatically destroyed. This deflation mechanism can increase the value of retained Mt 's NFT. After destruction, designated mtier will receive a new vMt's NFT as a credential to record your existing social network.\n\n### vMt's NFT Function\n\nvMt's NFT is a derivative NFT after the original Mt's NFT is destroyed. 20% of vMt's NFT will be used as the seed for the next project and the rest can be redeemed for future CON LAB new projects. Holding vMt's NFT will also continue to maintain your existing social connections, meaning you will continue to increase the value  your social connections. Further more, Holding vMt's NFT will also give you the opportunity to receive token airdrops.\n\n### Mt's redefines NFT\n\n\"The next era will be defined by today's social networking sites and the depth of connection given to users, and our job is to find the best way for users to share themselves\" - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nThe value of relationships is based on the sharing economy, which means sharing one's state of being, one's information, one's interests, one's hobbies. The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing. Mt’s aims to build a perpetual social-fi  generator in Web3.\n\nThe CON LAB will create a decentralized NFT trading platform driven by influencers and the community through a perpetual network of social connections, with the proceeds of each transaction distributed to the platform's NFT holders to enjoy perpetual dividends and a true return of equity to the user.\n\n## What is Mt's\n\n***The Made-it's , The Miss-it's, The My-turn's!***\n\nThis was a great movement that will eventually be remembered in crypto history. Free from the interference of capitals and authorities. There are no losers in this movement.\n\nThis time we are not a bystander, we are expressing our emotions in a way that will influence more crypto practitioners.\n\nFrom this moment on, Mt's will change the world.\n\n### Follow Mt’s\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MtsNFTs)    |    [Disocrd](https://discord.gg/TK3VCgH4pR)    |    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUahYxfJ2xaB9W9js3ifWQ)\n\n## Don't wait&see, up with Mt’s.", "timestamp": 1653375547, "digest": "vyA5575rvQ7kbqkumCcLLXqMptIBWzFhFzwE4MfQexc", "contributor": "0x5b23A5d907805a4dcFBe13aE232442A6746c5C9C"}

{"id": "agG2Gmq37069TNowr-MtnS86rr2aAeNdSf2P2f5I79o", "title": "千倍合约小教程", "body": "在开始之前，要提醒几个事：\n\n第一最好不要玩合约。除非你知道自己在做什么，但因为在币圈几乎大多数人最后都会去了解合约，那我建议你除非学习并实践过一年以上，否则，最多用300U和5X以下，以学习的心态，否则，相信我，结果一定是亏损。\n\n第二合约赚不了大钱。大钱要靠大趋势的现货，我们一起等熊市，我会告诉大家买什么。\n\n第三控制仓位最重要。要开合约，我也只建议5X以下，而且尽量大趋势下开，比如LUNA这种大崩，小钱玩一玩，实际上大仓位的人，0.5X都有爆仓几千万的人。但是倍数也和你的仓位相关，比如10U开50X，在全仓模式下等于100U开5X（逐仓的话永远只能5X以下），所以几乎只建议一个人永远只开一个固定倍数，比如交易大神静海飞鱼，永远是50X，但仓位占总仓位比例小。\n\n第四逐仓最多5X。如果是满仓，那么，最多开5X，10X已经是赌博了，至于20X、100X，那不存在的，因为没有好的止损工具存在，没有意义。\n\n**下面再开始讲教程（注意：如果看不懂，不要操作）**\n\n首先，问一个问题：30U本金，开千倍合约，理论上相当于仓位300U开*100倍，3000U*10倍，30000U 1倍一样，但是会开出来就爆仓？为什么我不10倍，而是傻子一样要千倍呢？有任何操作性？\n\n其实如前所说，10X都是高风险，那么，肯定要通过诀窍来享受到1000倍的福利，但最好只承担10X以下的风险。诀窍就是**借钱生钱，亏借的，不亏本金。**\n\n具体操作：\n\n30U的总仓位，起手开一个0.03U\\*1000X，其实相当于30U开10X，所以并不存在开单就爆仓，如果方向开对了，这个0.03U会迅速产生利润，如产生了200U利润，现在关键来了。\n\n设置一个保本的止损——把30U本金转走，你现在有利润200U有一个千倍的单子——在单边行情中，用利润可以在合适的时候慢慢加仓，这个时机和加仓大小很讲究，如果加早了、加大了，白忙一场，加小了，感觉浪费了机会。\n\n简单来说，就是总仓位放一点点小钱，但由于这一点点小钱通过起手开非常小的但是杠杆非常高的单子，于是亏损就是30U，盈利是按千倍走，而且和低杠杆不同的是，行情轻微波动，利润都变化很大，于是很容易用利润加仓，如果方向正确，而且加仓谨慎，很容易获得一个不错的回报——而风险就在于一开始方向错了，类似30U开10倍，爆了也无所谓，亏损就是这30U，但利润的话……\n\n这样，手续费之类都不在乎了，而且如果盈利了，及时锁定本金，确保不亏。利润如果增长了，用利润滚仓，碰到单边行情就不得了。\n\n我就是在比特币突破2万时，开了2U的千倍，后来用利润加仓到46U的本金，最后多的时候赚了近4万U，交易所把所有人盈利的单子强平了，钱发给大家，产品下架……当时群里很多人都是非常大的利润。一气之下，当即就让所有人从交易所提币走人了， 还好走了，现在A网已经登录不上了，所以推荐大家在币安\\\\OKX\\\\FTX三大所之外的交易所都不要放太多钱了。\n\n总结关键词就是：**极小仓位**，比如30U本金（我个人是300U，开0.3U起步）；**利润锁定**，只要赚了，就及时通过止损工具，确保不会被爆仓之类，把本金先转走。\n\n目前只有HOO有千倍，省手续费注册链接如下，HOO是个老牌交易所，不过我也是千倍才用它：\n\nhttps://www.hoo.tc/invite/26748434", "timestamp": 1653376323, "digest": "5olx9by6BhJLdDoM0dDOzPa3EjQdyOhRvNyO0s_kIgA", "contributor": "0x7A470d8014a122245b0410774618B7ED0E990Daa"}

{"id": "KC3rAY2b-Y-1Noj-kZMTIG_EcZrMsBMMG761bQOL_HA", "title": "The Stargate Omnichain mission", "body": "Hello earthlings!\n\nIt's no longer news about the first omnichain Fungible token: [Stargate finance](https://stargate.finance/), which is built on [LayerZero protocol.](https://layerzero.network/)                                                                                               The Omnichain Fungible token (OFT) title, was derived from its mobility on chain i.e.  the ability of $STG to move freely between all chains Layer zero exists.\n\nThis was made possible by solving the Bridging Trilemma, via **the *Delta (Δ)* algorithm**.\n\n[Ryan Zarick](https://twitter.com/ryanzarick?lang=en), co-founder and CTO of LayerZero outlined in indepth in the [Bridging Trilemma](https://medium.com/stargate-official/the-bridging-trilemma-d80788cce4ef).\n\n## Introducing the Delta (Δ) algorithm.\n\nThe *Delta (Δ)*  algorithm is a novel resource balancing algorithm that enables *unified native asset pools* on all chains while also providing *Instant Guaranteed Finality.*\n\n*Delta (Δ) algorithm* ticked all three boxes in the Bridging Trilemma and proved to be the first algorithm with attractive features capable of an ideal bridge.\n\nThe effect of this solution encompasses many on-chain activities.                               This is a modification to the  **lock + mint + Redeem**  mechanism of synthetic assets which can induce fragmented liquidity.\n\nWith bridging trilemma solved, we can now simultaneously have deep pools of native assets tied to all chains, creating orders of magnitude greater capital efficiency.         LPs will be able to stake into a singled-sided asset pool with no impermanent loss and collect fees from all incoming transfers regardless of their source chain. This would save users the time and fees needed to swap out undesirable synthetics on the destination chain or have a scenario where a transfer fails due to state change.\n\n## The fundamental security limit of bridges.\n\nGenerally, there are different perspectives to an ideal bridge either via “multi-chain” or “cross-chain” but both are limited to some fundamental securities which have proven to be honeypots for exploits.\n\nThese different perspectives steered up some healthy argument as [Vitalik](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin), co-founder of Ethereum blockchain remains optimistic about a multi-chain blockchain ecosystem rather than cross-chain applications.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uGoVsCU_R0fOfbW29FKXY.png?height=562&width=582)\n\nHowever, instead of fighting over influence on the mutual goal which is “The fundamental security”. We can as well derive means/protocols to mitigate the risks to the barest minimum.\n\nFollowing his argument tweet, he also acknowledged the quality of cross-rollup apps within “one zone of sovereignty”. Noting that, it is also a limit to the \"modular blockchains\" vision.  The key word “one zone of sovereignty”, Could this be Stargate on [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) ?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M7zDmYv1avOX68EsLN7Ch.png?height=276&width=596)\n\nWhat if we can limit these risks, by getting the roll-ups within one zone of sovereignty like he said. Seems like a blockchain myth, How’s that possible ?\n\nThink of an interoperable Omnichain protocol, leveraging on the security properties of Chainlink and Band oracles. Yes, that's [Layer zero](https://layerzero.network/); the skeleton framework of Stargate.         Ryan Zarick, explained how the interoperability works in his post on [LayerZero- An Omnichain Interoperability Protocol](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/layerzero-an-omnichain-interoperability-protocol-b43d2ae975b6)\n\nMeanwhile, Vitalik’s perspective on multichain over cross-chain focuses on ***wrapped assets as the solution.***                                                                                                                                                         The premises of his argument relies on “the limits to the security of bridges that hop across multiple zones of sovereignty”.\n\n## Mechanism of wrapped assets Vs Stargate cross-chain\n\nThere is no doubt that latency has proven to be a function of security and as such, the latent period shouldn’t be subjected to any sort of risk\\*\\*.\\*\\*                                              Meanwhile, one of ***the issues of a wrapped asset being the solution- is the risk on the duration of the transaction.***\n\nTo explain this clearly, let's zoom out to the user side:  A user with $1000 Eth on its  native chain A wants the same value of ETH on another chain B.\n\n> ***Using Stargate***: The user deposits hid preferred ETH value on chain A and gets out the same equivalent value of Eth in his preferred currency on his preferred chain.  Everything happens immediately, Bridge did its job and you have your cryptocurrency on your desired chain.\n\nIn a case of an uncertainty or dilemma where stargate is subjected to an exploit and probably goes to zero, You're all out in safe hands.\n\n> ***Using a wrapped asset*** : The user locks up the $1000 Eth on chain A and mints the equivalent value of synthetic Eth value on chain B.                                                         This transaction is not yet complete as long as the value of ETH on chain B is subjected to the risk of its equivalent value of Eth on chain A.\n\nIn a case of an uncertainty or dilemma where the original ETH on chain A is removed, then your  Synthetic Eth is now worthless.\n\n## Wrapped assets and Smart contract risk.\n\nWrapped assets works on a **(lock + mint + redeem)** mechanism and there are multiple angles of attack on smart contracts with this model.                                                     This could be  local smart contract risks, which may include poorly written codes that are vulnerable to exploits and hackers.\n\nLocal smart contract risks can be controlled yet seem inevitable for every smart-contracts.\n\nSeveral Audits can examine and do the best of their job but then there are other two angles of outstanding risk which are inescapable, these risks could be derived from *the validation mechanism and fraudulent messages.*                                                            This can be evident in the recent hack events,  where a hacker stuffs in some sort of false code(fraudulent messages) aiming at either  tricking the source contract to deliver false messages to the destination chain OR by directly tricking the destination chain to automate messages that aren't from the source code.\n\n[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) has always proven to be ahead of the emerging risks with the advent of “stop the hack\" protocol known as **[Pre-crime](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/introducing-pre-crime-49bef4a581d5?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------)**.\n\n## Introducing Pre-crime\n\nTransport layers are really innocent of the exploits, as most of the catastrophes are smart contract related and has nothing to do with transport layer. Yet these transport layers deliver the final fatality.\n\nEnd of worries, with the launch ***Pre-crime*** we could prevent the final blow from being delivered.\n\nPre-Crime initiates the ability for a relayer to stop a hack before it happens.      This is achieved by forking the destination blockchain before delivering the message and running the transaction locally.                                                                                  Pre-Crime also involves the authentication to check the state of the blockchain in relation to the other connected blockchains to confirm no malicious action occurred.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hb5TBC01De7O_m0ho9pvb.png?height=352&width=704)\n\nYou can read more about the additional layer of security : **[Pre-crime](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/introducing-pre-crime-49bef4a581d5)**.\n\nThis is just one of many steps LayerZero is taking to ensure the security of the omnichain future.\n\nThe ultimate goal of Stargate is to mitigate the risks of cross-chain swaps to the barest minimum.\n\nIn pursuit of this ultimate goal, several other sub-goals have been attained such as : Optimized volume and fees for swaps, transfers and LP.                                             **$STG**, the omnichain fungible token is the rocket science behind all these.\n\n## What’s Next\n\nThere's a lot going on, such as the Pre-crime, DEX integrations etc.\n\nThe Stargate team also cares about the community and the growth of Stargate protocol. That's why DAO governance is in place. It is vital to bring all forces together to build a strong protocol.\n\nTo ensure the efficacy of the governance, the community decided to use the Common wealth platform as the Forum that Stargate will be using for Proposals and Governance.\n\nBright minds can now come together, discuss and draft proposals.

{"id": "p5xFvBsjpweHXiWKo6oslUXKdvW0LcVbXiBXehB1Fyo", "title": "祛病延年十六妙诀 ", "body": "十六妙诀谱文  \n\n  \n\n水潮除后患，火起得长安。梦失封金匮，形衰守玉关。鼓呵消积聚，兜礼治伤寒。叩齿牙无疾，升观鬓不斑。运睛除眼翳，掩耳去头旋。托踏应轻骨，搓涂自美颜。闭摩通滞气，凝抱固丹田。淡食能多补，无心得大还。 \n\n \n\n释解  \n\n  \n\n一、水潮除后患  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n津液频生在舌端，寻常漱咽下丹田，  \n\n于中畅笑无凝滞，百日功灵可驻颜。  \n\n \n\n平明睡起时，即起端坐，凝神息虑，舌抵上 ，闭口调息，津液自生，渐至满口，分作三次，以意送下。久行之则五脏之邪火不炎，四肢之气血流畅，诸疾不生，久除后患，老而不衰。 \n\n \n\n功法：每日清晨睡醒后，即可盘膝端坐于床上，凝神定气，心无所虑，舌尖轻抵上腭，收腹提肛，闭口调息，口中津液自然产生，等到津液满口后，鼓漱三十六次，分三次慢慢吞咽，随着呼气，用意念送至小腹部丹田处。每次下咽须汩汩有声，如此，每日清晨练习三遍，即可从事其它事宜。  \n\n作用：此套功法发展甚多，并被许多养生功法所吸纳，如流传的“吞津功”，如能长期坚持研练，则五脏之火不能上炎，四肢的气血流畅无阻，不生疾病；并且精力旺盛，容颜润泽，虽年老也不会感到体力衰弱。  \n\n  \n\n二、火起得长安  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n阳火须知自下生，阴符上降落黄庭，  \n\n周流不息精神固，此是真人大炼形。 \n\n  \n\n子午二时，存想真火自涌泉穴起，先从左足行，上玉枕，过泥丸，降入丹田。三遍。次从右足，亦行三遍。复从尾闾起，又行三遍。久久纯熟，则百脉流通，五脏无滞，四肢健而百骸理也。 \n\n \n\n功法：每日夜半子时和中午午时，在床上盘膝端坐 (如在其它地方得有垫子)，意想真火从脚底涌泉穴内生。意念此火先从左脚底涌泉穴内起，经左大腿内后侧上行督脉，至脑后玉枕穴，再过泥丸(百会穴)，经任脉降人腹部丹田内，如此运行三遍；再用意念此火由右脚底涌泉穴内起，依上述运行路线运行三遍；最后存想真火从尾间内生，沿督脉上升，复由任脉下行至腹部丹田。如此亦运行三遍，意守丹田穴5—10分钟后，再缓缓收功。  \n\n作用：此套功法后来道家修行者将其演化为“青松不老功”。坚持长期研练，则百脉通畅，五脏无滞碍，四肢健壮，内气充盈，而百骸安宁，自可精神百倍，长久安康了。  \n\n  \n\n三、梦失封金匮  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n精滑神疲欲火攻，梦中遗失致伤生，  \n\n搓摩有诀君须记，绝欲除贪是上乘。  \n\n \n\n欲动则火炽，火炽则神疲，神疲则精滑而梦失也。寤寐时，调息神思，以左手搓脐二七，右手亦然。 \n\n复以两手搓胁，摆摇七七．咽气纳于丹田，握固良久乃止，屈足侧卧，永无走失。 \n\n \n\n功法：卧床未睡之时，先仰卧，调息定神，心无所虑。将两手掌心相对合，双手如洗手状相互搓摩至极热时，先用左手掌心搓脐十四次，然后再换右手搓脐十四次；待搓脐完后，再用两手搓摩两胁及左右腹部各十四次；最后两手交叉把定双肩摇摆七次；然后双手握固咽气人丹田，握固良久后即可停止。入睡时，从身体右侧卧，屈右腿仲左腿，右手掌心掩于右耳下，左手掌心朝下自然放于左大腿上，调匀呼吸，此即右侧睡法。  \n\n作用：此套功法可防止遗精，特别是因劳顿疲倦所致梦遗者。修真之士特别注重此功法，如郑思远真人曰：事多忘者神昏，汗多出者神脱。此是梦失神弱，脱漏真精，乃修真之士之大忌也。如能长期坚持研练，白可精神内固，神气内敛，生精益气壮筋骨，则梦遗精滑之症不治自愈也。  \n\n  \n\n四、形衰守玉关  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n却老扶衰别有方，不须身外觅阴阳，  \n\n玉关谨守常渊默，气足神全寿自康。  \n\n \n\n百虑感中，万事劳形。所以衰也。返老还童，非金丹不可。然金丹岂易得哉？善摄生者，行住坐卧，一意不散，固守丹田，默运神气，冲透三关，自然生精生气，则形可以壮，老可以耐矣。 \n\n \n\n功法：在日常生活中，无论行走坐卧，一有闲暇，即应敛神止虑，调息定气，意念不散，固守丹田，默运神气，冲透三关，运转小周天循环，自然产生精气。  \n\n作用：思虑伤心，琐事劳形，这是衰老的根本原因。要想返老还童，没有长生金丹不行，可金丹世上难以找寻，故善于养生者，金丹自在体内寻找。意守丹田，自可内气充盈，气血运转畅通，肢体康健，可享长寿。  \n\n  \n\n五、鼓呵消积聚  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n气滞脾虚食不消，腹中膨闷最唯调，  \n\n徐徐呵鼓潜通泰，疾退身安莫久劳。  \n\n \n\n有因食而积者，有因气而积者，久则脾胃受伤，医药难治。孰若节饮食，戒嗔怒，不使有积聚为妙？患者当正身闭息，鼓动胸腹，俟其气满，缓缓呵出。如此行五七次，便得通快即止。 \n\n \n\n功法：凡有胸腹部积聚之病，宜盘胨端坐，先以鼻吸气，鼓动有病的胸腹部，等到气满后，再张口慢慢地呵出，如此鼻吸口呵连做七次，觉身体舒畅后即可停止。此功法可反复行之，有病治病，无病防病，惟无病时，可意念将胸腹中的郁闷之气徐徐呵出即可。  \n\n作用：此套功法源自道家的“吐纳术”，据传道家龙门派第六代“真”字辈傅山先生所传授的“火龙功”，专门对症治疗身体某一部分疾病，可惜失传久矣。常人有因饮食而成积聚，有因气滞而成积聚，时间一长自然脾胃受损，中气不足，饮食难以消化，坚持研练此功，自可消除此疾。 \n\n \n\n六：兜礼治伤寒  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n跏趺端坐向蒲团，手握阴囊气要专。  \n\n运气叩头三五遍，顿令寒疾立时安。  \n\n \n\n元气亏弱，腠理不密，则风寒伤感。患者端坐盘足，以两手紧兜外肾，闭口缄息。存想真气自尾闾升，过夹脊，透泥丸，逐其邪气，低头屈抑如礼拜状，不拘数，以汗出为度，其疾即愈。 \n\n \n\n功法：盘膝端坐，两手兜住睾丸向上轻轻托起，闭口缄息，凝神调气，浑身放松，意念真气从尾闾处上行，沿督脉经循行，过夹脊，透过泥丸，将邪气逐出；如此运行三遍，然后低头屈身前俯，如礼拜叩首一样，不限次数，以汗出为度；亦可双手双臂前伸，身体前俯，不限次数，以汗出为度。此时所出汗液，不可让其自行回落，用干毛巾将其擦干即可。 \n\n作用：此套功法道家、佛家最后发展成“捻裆功”或“铁裆功”等，以增强生殖机能，保精保元，是为修真秘传功法。长期坚持研练此套功法，可壮元阳，益精气，密腠理，身体强健，外邪不侵，自无伤寒之疾。  \n\n  \n\n七、叩齿牙无疾  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n热极风生齿不宁，清晨叩漱自惺惺，  \n\n若教运用常无隔，还许它年老复丁。  \n\n \n\n齿之有疾，乃脾胃之火薰蒸。每侵晨睡醒时，叩齿三十六遍。以舌搅牙龈之上，不论遍数。 \n\n津液满口，方可咽下。每作三次乃止。凡小解之时，闭口切牙，解毕方开，永无齿疾。 \n\n \n\n \n\n功法：每日清晨睡醒后，盘膝端坐，两手握固放于左右大腿上，即叩齿三十六次；然后以舌搅牙龈上方数次，待口中津液满后，可鼓漱三十六遍，然后分三次缓缓咽下，咽下时须汩汩声响，直人腹中丹田。此功闲暇时亦可行之，凡解大小便，均可闭口咬牙，解完后稍待开口，则永无牙疾之患。此亦形意门秘传要诀。  \n\n作用：肾主骨，齿乃骨之余，人的衰老多由齿始，且齿的康健与否直接关乎肾脏的调节。修行家认为肾乃产精之源，惜精如命，故此功被修真之士定为每日必修功课。牙疾虽由多种原因引起，但只要坚持研练此套功法，自可永无牙疾之患，且可在不知不觉中精满神足元气壮，身体强健，可登寿域。  \n\n  \n\n八：升观鬓不斑  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n神气冲和精自全，存无守有养胎仙，  \n\n心中念虑皆消灭，要学神仙也不难。  \n\n \n\n思虑太过则神耗、气虚，血败而鬓班矣。要以子午时，握固端坐，凝神绝念，两眼令光，上视泥丸。存想追摄二气自尾闾间上升，下降返还元海，每行九遍。久则神全，气血充足，发可返黑也。 \n\n \n\n功法：在每日的夜牛子时和中午午时，盘膝端坐，两手握固放于大腿上，凝神止虑，调匀气息，两眼微闭，神光上视泥丸，意想追摄阴阳二气，息尾闾会阴穴沿督脉经循行上升，复沿任脉经降至喉咙，下人气海返归丹田，如此每次练习九遍收功。  \n\n作用：思虑太过，神耗气弱，血衰则头发斑白，而斑白发一般均先从鬓角开始。故长期坚持研练此套功法，可神全精足，气血旺盛，经脉通畅，毛发滋润，自可乌发而不斑白矣。此法高血压患者不宜练习。  \n\n  \n\n九、运睛除眼病  \n\n  \n\n伤热伤气，肝虚肾虚、则眼昏生翳，日久不治，盲瞎必矣。每日睡起时，趺坐凝思，塞兑垂帘，将双目轮转十四次，紧闭少时，忽然大瞪。行久不替，内障外翳自散，切忌色欲，并书细字。 \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n喜怒伤神目不清，垂帘塞兑养元精，  \n\n精生气化神来复，五内阴魔自失惊。 \n\n \n\n功法：每日清晨起床时，先盘膝端坐，凝神止虑，调息收心，闭口垂睑，塞耳息听，双目转动如轮，左右各十四次，顺逆旋转各一遍，紧闭一会双眼，然后突然睁大眼睛，如此数遍。  \n\n作用：肝开窍于目，目乃一身精华所聚，且与五脏六腑紧密相系。若被热、气等所伤，则眼睛容易昏花，生伤，时间一长则易失明，并能直接影响五脏六腑机能的正常运转。如能长期研练此功法，则内障外翳自然消散，眼睛明亮，神气逼人。此功忌色欲和看、写小字。  \n\n  \n\n十：掩耳去头旋  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n视听无闻意在心，神从髓海逐邪氛，  \n\n更兼精气无虚耗，可学蓬莱境上人。  \n\n \n\n邪风入脑，虚火上攻，则头目昏旋，偏正作痛。久则中风不语，半身不遂，亦由此致。治之，须静坐，升身闭息。以两手掩耳折头五七次。存想元神逆上泥丸，以逐其邪，自然风邪散去。 \n\n \n\n功法：盘膝端坐正身，收心闭息，用两手掌心掩耳昂头、低头五至七次，然后再摇头数次，意想元神逆上泥丸，逐去风邪，便觉脑中清彻宁静，一片祥和。  \n\n作用：邪风人脑，虚火上攻，则导致头目昏眩，及偏正头痛；时间久了则会导致中风不语、半身不遂等症。如能长期研练此功法，可使心肾相交，水火相济，降火逐邪，去风清神，疾病自治矣。  \n\n  \n\n十一：托踏应轻骨  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n精气冲和五脏安，四肢完固骨强坚，  \n\n虽然未得刀圭饵，且住人间做地仙。  \n\n \n\n四肢亦欲得小劳，譬如户枢终不朽，熊鸟演法，吐纳导引，皆养生之术也。平时双手上托，如举大石，两脚前踏，如覆平地，存想神气，根据按四时嘘呵二七次。则身轻体健，足耐寒暑。 \n\n \n\n功法：在日常生活中，闲暇之时，先双手上托，凭空用力，如举大石千斤，两脚前踏，如履平地，凭空承重，如负巨物；然后按四时，行六字诀，并存思吐出体内邪气。即春嘘、夏呵、秋呬、冬吹、三焦嘻、四季长呼各十四次。  \n\n作用：流水不腐，户枢不蠹，五禽戏、八段锦、吐纳导引之术皆养生之法。只要平日坚持研练，自能身轻体健，四肢灵活，精气冲和，五脏安康，延年益寿。  \n\n  \n\n十二：搓涂自美颜  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n欲寡心虚气自盈，自然五脏得和平，  \n\n衰颜仗此增光泽，不羡人间五等荣。  \n\n \n\n颜色憔悴，所由心思过度，劳碌不谨。每晨静坐闭目，凝神存养，神气冲澹，自内达外。以两手搓热，拂面七次。仍以嗽津涂面，搓拂数次。行之半月，则皮肤光润，容颜悦泽，大过寻常矣。 \n\n \n\n功法：每日清晨醒后，先盘膝闭目静坐，凝神调息意养神气平和充盈，精华自内而外，荣达于面部；然后将两手掌心相对，相互如洗手状搓热，以两掌心摩面七次；再用口中鼓漱之津液涂面，搓摩数十次即可。  \n\n作用：面容憔悴，是山思虑过度，劳碌不慎引起的。如能坚持研练这套功法，半月之后，白可皮肤光泽明亮，不同寻常。而今社会这霜那露皆化学制剂，哪如此等养颜美容之妙。  \n\n  \n\n十三：闭摩通滞气  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n荣卫流行不暂休，一才凝滞便堪忧，  \n\n谁知闭息能通畅，此外何须别计求。  \n\n \n\n气滞则痛，血滞则肿，滞之为患，不可不慎。治之，须澄心闭息，以左手摩滞七七遍，右手亦然，复以津涂之。勤行七日，则气血通畅，永无凝滞之患。修养家所谓干沐浴者，即此义也。 \n\n \n\n功法：在日常生活中，闲暇之时，盘膝静坐，凝神止虑，清心闭息，意念注于患处，先用左手搓摩患处四十九次，再用右手亦搓摩患处四十九次；然后再用津液涂患处五至七次；四肢躯干均可用此法搓摩，修真之士称之为干沐浴。  \n\n作用：气滞则痛，血滞则肿，气血阻滞，百病从生。此套功法不止散气消肿，无病行之，上下闭息，经络通畅，气血流行，肌肤光莹，乃养生之道也。如能长期研练，则永无疑痛肿疼之苦，不需寻医问药了。  \n\n  \n\n十四：凝抱固丹田  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n丹田完固气归根，气聚神凝道合真，  \n\n久视定须从此始，莫教虚度好光阴。  \n\n \n\n元神一出便收来，神返身中气自回。如此朝朝并暮暮，自然赤子产真胎。此凝抱之功也。平时静坐，存想元神入于丹田，随意呼吸。旬日，丹田完固；百日，灵明渐通。不可或作或辍也。 \n\n \n\n功法：在日常生活中，闲暇之时，盘膝静坐，意想元神进人丹田，然后意念随丹田开合而呼吸，十数天后丹田充实，百日后则灵通渐明，勤行不辍，功不间断，自有奇效。  \n\n作用：此套功法乃道家秘传“百日筑基功”，静中寓动，阴阳相合之意，凝神意守丹田如鸡孵卵，使丹田有充固真气之效，它与道外流行不同，故诗曰：“元神一出便收来，神返身中气自回；如此朝朝并暮暮，自然赤子产真胎。”  \n\n  \n\n十五：淡食能多补  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n厚味伤人无所知，能甘淡薄是吾师，  \n\n三千功行从此始，天鉴行藏信有之。  \n\n \n\n五味之于五脏，各有所宜。若食之不节，必至亏损。孰若食淡谨节之为愈也？然此淡亦非弃绝五味，特言欲五味之冲淡耳。仙翁有云∶断盐不是道，饮食无滋味。可见其不绝五味，淡对浓而言，若膏粱过度之类如吃素是也。 \n\n \n\n说明：此功即教人节食鸡鸭伍肉，煎炸烹烤肥厚美味，提倡五谷杂粮，瓜果蔬菜调和搭配。且肥厚生浊，淡食化清，补精益气。故古人曰：是故谨和五味，竹正筋柔，气血以流，胺理以密，如是则骨气以精。谨道如法，长有天命。  \n\n  \n\n十六：无心得大还  \n\n \n\n谱诀： \n\n有作有为云至要，无声无嗅语方奇，  \n\n中秋午夜通消息，明月当空造化基。  \n\n \n\n大还之道，圣道也。无心者，常清常静也。人能常清静，天地悉皆归。何圣道之不可传，大还之不可得哉！《清静经》已备言之矣。修真之士，体而行之。欲造夫清真灵妙之境，若反掌耳。 \n\n \n\n说明：修真之士应以清心为本，参天地日月造化，保持清静，身体力行，妙悟玄机，可得大还之道，自可返老还童，可登寿域矣。 \n\n ",

One such collective, appropriately titled BFF, has made some noteworthy progress in the space. Only a few months old, the community has over more than 50,000 members in its space which includes some women celebrities including, Mila Kunis, Gwyneth Paltrow, Paris Hilton and Tyra Banks.\n\nAnother collective that has made some splash known as the,  Black Women Blockchain Council, to onboard more black women into web3. This community has been around since 2018. Some others such as WomenRise, Boss Beauties, Crypto Chicks are also currently ruling the roost in the NFT space. To be honest, this is just the tip of the iceberg and a lot more needs to be done.\n\n**How do we get there?**\n\nWe can’t iterate this enough but education is the stepping stone to everything. If we want real life adoption, we have to understand that correct awareness is the prerequisite to that. Supporting and educating women, before aiming to onboard them into web3 is the chief requirement\n\nA few startups are already working towards that. One of the most notable ones include, Unstoppable Domains, that launched $10M Women of web3 initiative. To do so, they have tied up with nearly 65 initiatives to make this program a reality.\n\nAdditionally, our project, [Girl With Secrets](https://twitter.com/gwsofficialNFT) is working towards creating an ecosystem where women feel comfortable about seeking careers in crypto. We aim to create a program where women will be given the first preference when they seek out education and internship opportunities and our NFT collection has been curated to further that purpose.\n\n![She is coming for you...stay on guard ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aiyTdWVHAnSbE-0UdG52W.png?height=4096&width=3067)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, education is the prerequisite to every act of adoption. Until people are made aware of the possibilities, they would not know which option is their best choice. Girl With Secrets will work towards presenting that choice to women who have until now, haven’t been able to find their way into web3.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n### How can you reach us?\n\n**Twitter**: @gwsofficialNFT\n\n**Discord**: [https://discord.gg/KHe9YyjDmz ](https://discord.gg/KHe9YyjDmz)\n\n**Instagram**:<https://www.instagram.com/gwsofficialnft/>\n\n**Telegram**: <https://t.me/+K89a-DsFOkY5ODY0>\n\n**Whatsapp**: <https://chat.whatsapp.com/GUCTg7VPOoNGXBh5S5Y5TK>\n\n**Facebook**: <https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100080914332795&sk=about>\n\n**Reddit**: <https://www.reddit.com/user/gwsofficialnft>\n\n**Quora**: <https://www.quora.com/profile/Marketing-GWS>\n\n**TikTok**: <https://www.tiktok.com/@gwsofficial.nft?lang=en>", "timestamp": 1653376782, "digest": "bHrW2wXVzkOO1Ko1191hK65tL0MkOgJUEkGOtthzUe8", "contributor": "0x6E2aE861d64d8E56E6438731b52920c9CBB430Cc"}
{"id": "YS03f-CaGGnG2w-zpnFo2UvhuEZNmSBMewhSuGXEGNk", "title": "What is an iNFT?", "body": "To better understand this, we need to understand the fundamental problem of the Internet.\nAlthough the Internet was a great invention and changed the lifestyles of many people, this influential invention has a fundamental problem, and that is the domination of governments or corporations on it; with the advent of the Internet, p2p transactions are gone and there will always be an intermediary, who gets a large share of the transactions, however, the people who produce the content or coding, have a small portion, and most of the profits belongs to these intermediaries, who are often government or government-affiliated entities.\n\nToday, blockchains, which are known as the internet of value, have made a difference in recent years, as has the Internet.\nOne of the achievements of blockchain is NFT, which is gaining people's attention every day as it grows.\nIn newer cases, these NFTs have been integrated with artificial intelligence, which raises concerns.\nCritics believe that just as the Internet is run by certain people, these NFTs equipped with artificial intelligence may also become autonomous and rebellious.\n\nEven if you don't want to, in the near future all NFTs will have artificial intelligence, capable of making sense, and possibly intelligence, on a human level in the coming decades.\niNFTs are generated in the form of an intelligent coding contract that is unchangeable.\nThe produced iNFT is not only remarkably intelligent but also has the capabilities of perception and animation.\nThese NFTs constantly learn, either through their owner or through searching the internet.\niNFT basically increases the value of NFTs by 100 times. They are smart, scalable, productive, and aware, and the Alethea AI protocol is the interface between these NFTs and the data access network.\n\n•\tThings we may see in the future by using this protocol and artificial intelligence include:\n\n* Rap battle between Cryptopunk on Twitch platform:\n  A Cryptopunk can talk to you soon and rap against another Cryptopunk in Rap battle, which is watched by millions of people.\n* Shortly, you will have two-way experiences with your NFT, and you may laugh at jokes or get inspired by each other.\n* Digital agriculture:\n  Depending on the type of land you have in the world of Metaverse, this farmer reminds you to cultivate your land.\n* Shortly, only those who are the Holders of that project will have the right to vote in the decisions of that Meta-world as citizens.\n\nGiven the Alethea AI protocol, all you need to do is code, to create a smart NFT for yourself.\nWhile the risks of centralization are high, due to its dependence on the OpenAI model, there are new open source projects which eliminate this concern.\n\nWhen man first split the atom, the result was the creation of tremendous energy that could be used for constructive or destructive purposes.\nSimilarly, we can now enter the designing space with infinite depth and dimensions, which allows us to turn NFT into a smart, irreplaceable asset, or use it to destroy ourselves.\n\n## Concluding remarks:\n\"Like the tools of the present world that satisfy our material desires, iNFTs enhance our spirituality. In general, INFTs lead us to a different technical and moral dimension.\nSmart NFTs may one day revive our ancestors' language structures, or invent new things.\"", "timestamp": 1653376864, "digest": "eoT1bLHhQdAh6-3VZz1WuqknOdjr6xnCGQihaZ7YkpE", "contributor": "0xfb136ba1A47dB63cE180B5Bb8ea0A0aFFcB8925e"}

{"id": "ymhOcOUYLg_OseKrBmmrKUwyML7KbVcTNpusWGRkN50", "title": "从货币政策角度，对Terra崩盘及稳定币设计的思考", "body": "每个人都想成为美联储，通过发行货币向全世界征用取铸币税，超发货币照成的通胀有全世界一同买单。Terra 曾被冠以算法稳定币界美联储的称号，最终的结果确是 Luna 和 UST 总共 400 多亿的市值在几天时间内蒸发，让人唏嘘不已。本文从货币政策的角度出发，探讨 Terra 崩盘的本质原因和新公链稳定币设计方案。\n\n## 1. Terra 简介\n\n鉴于 USDT、USDC 等中心化稳定币背后的抵押物不透明，DAI、MIM 等利用超额抵押铸造出来的去中心化稳定币资金利用率低，Terra 提出了一种全新的算法稳定币机制。已经很多优秀的文章详细得介绍了 Terra，本文主要从货币的角度对算稳进行思考，因此不对 Terra 做过多的描述。简单来说 Terra 就是一系列法币稳定币，通过算法来实现稳定币和法币价格的锚定。其中流通量交易量最大的是 UST，因此本文后面的关于 Terra 的稳定币专指 UST。Terra 稳定币实现锚定的套利机制如下：\n\nTerra系统采用双代币机制，即Luna和UST，Luna价格可以自由波动，UST锚定美元。Luna用于吸收UST的波动。假设目前 1 Luna = 100 U：\n\n* 当 1 UST = 1.2 U时，用户可以花 100 U 购买 1 Luna 进行销毁并铸造出 100 UST，卖出后可获得 120 U，盈利20U。随着市场上越来越多人参与套利，最终会使得 1 UST = 1 U，带来的结果是 Luna 流通量减小，价格升高，UST流通量增大，价格降低，表现为稳定币的扩张。\n* 当 1 UST = 0.8 U时，用户可以花 100 U 购买 125 UST 进行销毁，并铸造出 1.25 Luna，卖出后可获得 125 U，盈利 25 U 。随着市场上越来越多人参与套利，最终会使得 1 UST = 1 U，带来的结果是 Luna 流通量增大，价格降低，UST流通量减小，价格升高，表现为稳定币的收紧。\n\n![Terra 套利机制](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J74lpDNDJ05qaL54lr0Yk.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n## 崩盘事件回顾\n\n### 2.1 前提\n\n5\\.7号崩盘前夕，UST总市值为18.7B，逼近Luna的23.4B的市值，整个Terra生态杠杆率过高是狙击UST 成功的前提。\n\n![UST 与 Luna 市值， 来源: Footprint](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ndtWqEy2uAGe2fuR86rAp.png?height=384&width=899)\n\n### 2.2 时机\n\n为了增加 Curve 4 pool（UST - USDT - USDC - Frax）流动性，以排挤竞争对手 DAI，Terra 团队从 Curve UST-3Crv（USDT - USDC - DAI）中移除 [1.5 亿 UST 流动性](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x18bd477f9beeff22b2ad0c6d48a9c0f02b542049789f0638f5ec50365f1d1de7)，准备往 4pool 转移。给做空者留下了低成本攻击 UST - 3Crv的机会。\n\n![从UST - 3CRV 中撤池并转换成 1.5 亿 UST，来源：Etherscan.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IC_KUZcy9JpfOupxZNUDj.png?height=399&width=1161)\n\n### 2.3 行动\n\n随后，[85 M](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xaa23df48c53f221d0e8ac60ffc9e69340f3e8948fcdc936f3aee9c887d802abb) 的 UST转到 Curve 中砸掉换成 USDC，随后，大量地址加入UST砸盘大军，[UST-3Crv LP严重失衡](https://dune.com/queries/684097/1268954)，引发 UST 脱钩警戒线。\n\n![85 M UST 转入 Curve 进行砸盘， 来源：Etherscan.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/30qwUV82W-Fq-5cEhhPYe.png?height=436&width=1144)\n\n![UST - 3Crv比例失衡，来源： DuneAnalysis(@mhonkasalo)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/h0Kju89-xExywqex3vIxI.png?height=540&width=1474)\n\n### 2.4 防守\n\n为了使 UST - 3Crv 池子保持平衡，把 UST 重新锚定，团队兵分两路，[卖掉了 5万多个 ETH 到 Curve去护盘，转了 2万个ETH到币安去护盘](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x6b671b51258db0316dd89bc0075d6113488be5e8)，使得 Curve 中的 UST- 3Crv 重新达到平衡。由于团队的ETH大部分委托给了 Lido 参与 ETH2.0 Staking，所以有大量 ETH 是通过 stETH 兑换而来的，随后引发市场对 stETH 脱钩的担忧。\n\n![stETH - ETH 受到冲击，来源：Dune Analysis(@LidoAnalytical)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YyR-i09qKyQdOWNhJ294p.png?height=549&width=1697)\n\n### 2.5 破防\n\n资金来回较量好几回，Terra 团队将资金消耗大半，大量的 UST 是从 Anchor 中赎回，由于 Anc 赎回 UST 无需锁定期，无法给团队缓冲器，大量UST从Anc赎回，砸向市场，导致UST进一步脱钩，并且 UST 脱钩推动套利者将 UST 销毁铸造成 Luna 砸向市场，导致 Luna 的价格开始暴跌。由于每天可以低价差用UST去铸造Luna的数量有限，超过一定限额后，兑换价差将会增大，使得套利者减少。因此 UST 脱钩的程度与套利价差有关。当套利价差出现时，难以通过套利者套利使 UST 回归正常水平，UST 脱钩时间太长，进一步照成 UST 信用损失，更多的 UST 会砸向市场和铸造成 Luna 砸向市场。当 Luna 市值小于 UST 时，进一步引发信任危机，引发挤兑，开启死亡螺旋。\n\n## 3. 从货币角度分析 Terra 崩盘的本质原因\n\n### 3.1 UST 使用场景失调，资金在借贷市场空转\n\n一国货币的使用场景对内有的消费、投资和储蓄，以促进内部经济循环，对外有消费和投资，将系统内部的通胀对外输出。把每条公链比作一个国家，公链中的稳定币也应满足以上五种使用场景。\n\n对内：\n\n* 消费：用稳定币购买生态中生产的商品，如购买NFT和在Gamefi中的氪金；\n* 投资：用稳定币进行生态内投资，如参与 IDO 和在去中心化交易所（DEX）交易；\n* 储蓄：将稳定币存入到借贷协议中赚取利息；\n\n对外：\n\n* 消费：使用稳定币购买生态以外的消费品；\n* 投资：通过跨链，使用稳定币购买生态之外的标的；\n\n看看Terra在这五个方面做的努力：\n\n对内：\n\n* 消费：Terra生态中有少量关于NFT和游戏的项目满足用户消费需求；\n* 投资：Mirror是Terra生态中的重要投资场所，提供了美股合成资产交易；\n* 储蓄：Anchor在Terra生态中起到积累储蓄的作用。\n\n对外：\n\n* 消费：与各种支付平台合作，如Chai、Astral等，用户可以在使用Terra稳定币购买链下的商品；\n* 投资：通过跨链桥，用户可以去到其他公链上进行投资消费；UST上架Binance、FTX等头部交易所，用户可以用UST去购买其他投资标的\n\n其中链下购买商品和上架主流交易所是 UST 最大的亮点，为其在稳定币竞争中建立强大的壁垒。\n\n![Terra 生态，来源：Twitter @Terraians_](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B54wTwECI_TTp_7k0EED6.png?height=692&width=1227)\n\n从五种场景的结构来看，在崩盘前夕，UST总发行量为 [18.7B](https://terra.smartstake.io/history)，其中储蓄在 Anchor 中的UST为 [14B](https://app.anchorprotocol.com/#/)，有 75% 的 UST 使用于储蓄。表明其他四种使用场景推进困难，导致整个生态储蓄率过高，整个货币流通结构极度失衡。因此，Anchor 是推动 Terra 生态崩盘的罪魁祸首。\n\n![UST供应量，来源：Terra Analytics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HeVhpq_k607FuCsnow0RW.png?height=566&width=905)\n\n![存在Anchor中的UST数量，来源：Anchor](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rt1CtRQCmshKNaiXz7DnN.png?height=648&width=1626)\n\n由于 Defi 市场的 APY 波动较大，因此 Anchor 推出了 20% 的固定存款利率。同时为了激励用户进行借款，给予贷款用户补贴，使其可以负利率借款。当整体 Defi 市场的存款利率下降时，Anchor 也没有及时调低存款利率和取消贷款补贴，贷款方借出 UST 后没有更好的地方可以去，只好存入Anchor中，**资金在整个存贷系统中空转，进一步得提高了Terra生态的杠杆率**，直到UST的市值逼近Luna。高的货币发行量并没有带来低利率和高投资效应，资金没有流向生态的其他应用场景，对应的现实中，当高的社会融资规模，并没有带来经济的增长的时候，资金在金融系统中空转，会使整体系统性风险提高。\n\n### 3.2 传导机制受阻，无法自发调节货币供应量\n\n固定汇率制，资本自由流动，货币政策的独立性是经济学中经典的三元悖论，取其中两个，必然需要放弃第三个。**算稳的首要目标是锚定汇率，同时公链之间通过跨链桥自由流动，相当于一国采用采取了资本自由流通下的固定汇率制，必然会丧失掉对货币政策的独立性。**\n\n![货币政策的三个不可能](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NmmCcUgGZiDRyjDYGyrEp.png?height=477&width=624)\n\nTerra 通过 Anchor 强行控制存款利率，在 Terra 超发货币的时候，利率调节受阻，无法通过传导机制自发调节减少货币供应量，最终影响货币政策目标的实现。实际上，团队作为 Luna 最大的持有人，是最有激励去做超发货币的操作，一方面可以使得 Luna 进一步通缩快速拉升其市值，另一方面，用高息债券作为超发货币的蓄水池，以此提升协议整体 TVL，来提高 Luna的整体估值。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5tcQIuSoFhmUSrDU1rkjx.png?height=111&width=994)\n\n### 3.3 流动性缺失加速死亡螺旋\n\nTerra 生态中，UST 相当于是面值为 1 的可转债，Luna 相当于股权。从传导机制上看，Luna 只用于吸收 UST 的波动，Luna的价格变动并会不导致 UST 脱钩。Luna 并不是 UST 储备金的体现，而是债务流动性的体现。流动性是指资产变现不受损失的能力，**UST 的流动性为 UST 二级市场的变现能力以及 Luna 的变现能力的最大值。**二级市场变现能力主要在 Curve 和交易所中。**当 UST 脱钩的时，UST 流动性减弱，需要依赖Luna 的流动性。**持币人将 UST 转换为 Luna 进行变现，当 Luna 市值低于 UST 市值时，说明 Luna 的流动性不足以偿还 UST 的债务，UST 债务变现必然遭受损失。\n\n当 Terra 显著违约时，需要进行缩表和扩充资产端。团队将手中存量的 UST 或者折价回购的 UST 债务转换为 Luna 完成债转股，并将 Luna 砸向市场，完成缩表和扩充资产端。不断增发的 Luna 导致整个 Terra 网络不完全，容易产生治理攻击，使 Luna 失去了公链价值，进一步降低 Luna 的估值。\n\n## 4. 新公链稳定币的设计思考\n\n新兴市场国家往往因为货币政策使用不当，引发新兴市场风险。近几年越来越多的新公链崛起，新公链就像是一个个新兴市场国家，其稳定币设计是最容易积累系统性风险的环节，为了避免一个稳定币协议拖垮整条公链的情况，提出以下两点新公链稳定币的设计思考。\n\n### 4.1 下放铸币权\n\n正如每届总统都会想在自己任免期间采取扩张的政策以拉动经济，因此要保证货币政策的制定不受政府的影响。公链团队有很大激励去做货币超发，但是在固定汇率和资本自由流动下，无法实现货币超发，因此团队会做一些干预来使得整个货币传导机制不通畅，给公链积累系统性风险。因此需要将铸币权下方，生态中多种算稳协议共同竞争，以减少稳定币协议崩盘给整条公链生态带来的冲击。无法使用扩张的货币政策，转而采用扩张的财政政策，如生态基金奖励项目方（搞基建）、降低 Gas（降低税收）、给深度用户发空投（提高居民福利水平）等，扩张的财政政策对整个生态的经济建设和用户会更好一些。\n\n### 4.2 降低稳定币协议风险与新公链代币的相关性\n\n为了避免稳定币崩盘带来的死亡螺旋效应，新公链的稳定币协议，应该减少使用新公链代币做为储备，以降低协议风险和公链风险的相关性，从而避免死亡螺旋。用新公链代币做抵押储备资产发行的稳定币，当稳定币脱钩时，会有更多的新公链代币被赎回，并砸向市场，当稳定币在生态中占有重要地位时，容易触发稳定币协议与公链代币的死亡螺旋。\n\n## 5. 结语\n\nWeb 3 的世界每天都在快速迭代，倒下了一个 Terra，还有千千万万的 “Terra” 在算稳赛道上贡献自己的智慧。设计者和投资者应当深入研究货币政策的内核原理，避免披上算法稳定币外衣的旁氏骗局。期待在不久的将来会出现更加成熟稳定的稳定币方案。", "timestamp": 1653377258, "digest": "D2VmXUAdHg_9TcQlMl8FuiaM6-iIVXFi7q9y1JbBkqI", "contributor": "0x81Fd71e8144e44D4c767bb192013AC3f0E9e23C8"}

The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing.

Gox 受黑客攻击，平台的10万枚比特币及用户的75万枚比特币被盗，占当时比特币流通总量7%，也是目前为止金额数最大的比特币失窃案。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-G5CR-7vFJvZHsT_lXU-6.png?height=693&width=1080)\n\n2月25日，Mt. Gox 宣布关闭交易，仅仅两天，比特币价格暴跌31%。\n\n到了2015年初，比特币价格跌至200美元下。\n\n2015年2月，*The End Of Bitcoin*（比特币的终结）一文面世，文中称比特币并不具备可循环的经济体系，正在消亡的迹象之一是几乎没有人真正使用这种货币。\n\n2016年1月14日，当时颇具影响力的 Mike Hearn 宣布比特币失败，并透露他已售出所有比特币，受此消息影响，比特币价格单日下跌 10%。\n\n华盛顿邮报刊登了 *R.I.P. Bitcoin. It’s Time To Move On*（安息吧比特币，是时候继续前进了），对比特币唱起了挽歌，文章中提了中国的矿场，提及比特币社区正在内战，表示“让我们记住是什么让一些风险资本家对比特币狂热：纯粹的贪婪，这就是我最清楚比特币失败的原因。”\n\n## 03\n\n2017年，比特币走出其第一个高点。\n\n在此周期，*Bitcoin Prices Are Headed To $0.00: Peter Schiff*（彼得希夫：比特币价格将跌至0美元）一文中记载，欧洲太平洋资本首席执行官彼得希夫表示，“最终，我认为比特币真的没有价值，在市场上，它有很多价值，只要有购买，就有价值。但是当购买消失时，价值也就消失了。”\n\n希夫说，“当音乐停止时”，很多纸面利润最终会消失。\n\n这一年的9月4日，央行联合七部委全面叫停 1C0，定性 1C0 为非法融资行为，国内交易所也被关闭。\n\n这也是为当下行业中，大部分人经历的第一次冲击。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_WJXti-OV0NTN5w4SG6VB.png?height=511&width=957)\n\n94之后，还有312，不过这已经是三年之后。\n\n2020年3月12日，加密货币市场经历了惨绝人寰的24小时。\n\n2020 年 3 月 12 日下午六点半开始，比特币为首的加密货币突然开始大跳水，比特币价格从 7000 美元开始下跌，在 13 日 7 点左右，短暂稳定后的比特币再次坠落下跌，一度跌至 3800 美元，24 小时内，暴跌近 50%。\n\n据币 Coin 数据显示，“312”的 24 个小时内，全网遭遇爆仓的人数超过 10 万 人，最大单笔爆仓单发生在 Huobi，比特币价值约 5832 万美元，而全网爆仓总金额 29.3 亿美元，约合 205 亿元人民币。\n\n## 04\n\n如今看来，312 只是全球金融市场黑天鹅开始的缩影。\n\n时间调回当下，5 月 12 日，CoinGecko 数据显示，加密资产总市值现已跌至 1.23 万亿美元，24 小时跌幅 16.8%。\n\nF2pool 数据显示，随着比特币下跌至 27,000 美元上下，按照 0.4 元电费计算，包括蚂蚁 S9 全系列在内的多款矿机已到达关机币价。此外，蚂蚁 S11（关机币价 25098.80 美元）、神马 M10（关机币价 23306.03 美元）、阿瓦隆 A9（关机币价 26813.63 美元）等矿机目前已接近关机币价。\n\n持有加密货币的玩家大多经历着切肤之痛。\n\n此处可能有一个小提示，尤其在什么事情都可能发生的当下——永远不要侵吞生活的钱来用于投资，更不要借钱去投资。\n\n## 05\n\n本文只想和大家分享一下比特币，乃至加密市场发展至今遭遇的系列评价，毕竟思考一件事时，将时间轴拉长，或许能取得不一样的视角。\n\n当下的市场情绪不佳，以“加密恐惧与贪婪指数”来说，这两天数值都处于12，意味极度恐惧之时。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U0xuhyXE-iqGW5zjd7Sh3.png?height=342&width=773)\n\n虽然“挫折使人强大”这件事儿更该感谢的是自己不是挫折，但挫折一般能帮你累积经验，同时，也能帮你分辨是否真的热爱所做之事。\n\nWeb3.0 的趋势便是让人们能够做喜欢的事儿同时获得报酬，DAO 组织也基于共同热爱。\n\n那么，这段时间也许可以思考一下，到底是如何看待这个市场，以及想如何参与（不要在夜晚做决定哦\\~），所谓 to be or not to be.\n\n## 06\n\n最后再引用一些 Bitcoin Is Dead 网站上，收录的“随机的，错误的未来预测列表”作为结尾博君一笑，永远不要让想象力和未来，死在你的前面：\n\n“高速铁路旅行是不可能的，因为无法呼吸的乘客会死于窒息。” ——爱尔兰作家 Dr. Dionysius Lardner（1830 年）\n\n“能发明的东西，都发明了。” - 美国专利局局长 Charles H. Duell (1899)\n\n“我们不喜欢他们的声音，而吉他音乐正在消失。” - 迪卡唱片公司关于不签约披头士乐队（1962）\n\n“iPhone 不可能获得任何重要的市场份额。” ——Steve Ballmer，微软首席执行官（2007 年）\n\n \n 结尾。\n\n另注：本文成文于5月12日。 \n ", "timestamp": 1653377732, "digest": "hX2vMWIEmeSQESUpkStsWQoXuH6yUYzeFtkSCsc5z5g", "contributor": "0xf042Ad30a7F1172CDa1087115638eaFAEB164454"}

Terra 简介\n\n鉴于 USDT、USDC 等中心化稳定币背后的抵押物不透明，DAI、MIM 等利用超额抵押铸造出来的去中心化稳定币资金利用率低，Terra 提出了一种全新的算法稳定币机制。已经很多优秀的文章详细得介绍了 Terra，本文主要从货币的角度对算稳进行思考，因此不对 Terra 做过多的描述。简单来说 Terra 就是一系列法币稳定币，通过算法来实现稳定币和法币价格的锚定。其中流通量交易量最大的是 UST，因此本文后面的关于 Terra 的稳定币专指 UST。Terra 稳定币实现锚定的套利机制如下：\n\nTerra系统采用双代币机制，即Luna和UST，Luna价格可以自由波动，UST锚定美元。Luna用于吸收UST的波动。假设目前 1 Luna = 100 U：\n\n* 当 1 UST = 1.2 U时，用户可以花 100 U 购买 1 Luna 进行销毁并铸造出 100 UST，卖出后可获得 120 U，盈利20U。随着市场上越来越多人参与套利，最终会使得 1 UST = 1 U，带来的结果是 Luna 流通量减小，价格升高，UST流通量增大，价格降低，表现为稳定币的扩张。\n* 当 1 UST = 0.8 U时，用户可以花 100 U 购买 125 UST 进行销毁，并铸造出 1.25 Luna，卖出后可获得 125 U，盈利 25 U 。随着市场上越来越多人参与套利，最终会使得 1 UST = 1 U，带来的结果是 Luna 流通量增大，价格降低，UST流通量减小，价格升高，表现为稳定币的收紧。\n\n![Terra 套利机制](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J74lpDNDJ05qaL54lr0Yk.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n## 崩盘事件回顾\n\n### 2.1 前提\n\n5\\.7号崩盘前夕，UST总市值为18.7B，逼近Luna的23.4B的市值，整个Terra生态杠杆率过高是狙击UST 成功的前提。\n\n![UST 与 Luna 市值， 来源: Footprint](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ndtWqEy2uAGe2fuR86rAp.png?height=384&width=899)\n\n### 2.2 时机\n\n为了增加 Curve 4 pool（UST - USDT - USDC - Frax）流动性，以排挤竞争对手 DAI，Terra 团队从 Curve UST-3Crv（USDT - USDC - DAI）中移除 [1.5 亿 UST 流动性](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x18bd477f9beeff22b2ad0c6d48a9c0f02b542049789f0638f5ec50365f1d1de7)，准备往 4pool 转移。给做空者留下了低成本攻击 UST -

Yes, But Not In the Current Approach](https://medium.com/@SonorusNetwork/is-web3-the-saviour-of-the-music-industry-yes-but-not-in-the-current-approach-2cbecd45cbc9)**\n\nIn the traditional music industry, big labels decide which singers to promote and what type of songs we can discover. They usually sign singers at a very early stage, to control their music style and even their social image. That’s why many people feel music has become more commercial than artistic. Independent musicians are rising, but most of them still keep underground and are hard to be scouted.\n\n[https://youtu.be/_FRKh7VbDQo](https://youtu.be/_FRKh7VbDQo)\n\nIn the whole process, audiences are passive receivers. In the Web2 era, RSS used to be considered an approach to breaking down the monopoly of streaming services giants. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitors sites for new content, removing the need for the user to check them manually. However, RSS still requires users to be able to know where to find good music, especially those unpopular pieces, and to keep updating their subscribed lists to follow newly emerging stars. Obviously, it is not an easy task for most music listeners. Listening to music is not a must-have thing for them, but a good-to-have thing. Thus, people need solid incentives to explore music and keep listening. They need real incentives.\n\nAt the same time, the traditional music model ignores the contribution of normal listeners. Let’s consider a question. How do you find a new song and add it to your playlist? You might find a new piece from your friend’s playlist, from a random person’s personal blog, or from a party. In summary, you might find music everywhere. Music distribution is naturally a decentralized process and many distributions happen within people’s social networks instead of a centralized music promotion or recommendation project. However, 100% of advertisement payments go to those centralized music projects, and the real promoters — listeners — receive zero.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETV3iIibi1c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETV3iIibi1c)\n\nIn a word, the current music distribution system neither motivates people to find good music nor rewards those who spread music to a broader scale. However, in the Web3 era, things can be different with blockchain technology. The popular X-to-earn model can play a big role here. You are the early listener of a song? You should be rewarded for your effort to find new music! You share music on your social media and bring larger exposure? You should be rewarded for your contribution to spreading a good voice. You are willing to share your streaming data with developers to develop new DApps? You should definitely be rewarded for sharing your digital assets — data.\n\nIn the new system, each minor effort can be seen and rewarded. When listeners are more motivated to find new and possibly unpopular music and share it, more musicians would love to start creating something and try something new, and the whole music industry can thereby keep attracting the most talented and creative brains to keep it healthy and vital.\n\nWithout music-to-earn, the music industry would be dying. Trust me.\n\nSonorus is hoping to provide a complete music-to-earn model to lead this revolutionary experiment in the music industry. Sounds exciting to you?

{"id": "RSiSuYJEQIv-QDCBzrmDUwtSVWK6t4Iz0iF7HrhysNE", "title": "Crypto Scams! Don't Fall!", "body": "Past years in cryptocurrency world was full of scams. Sometimes, these scams were so  obvious that everyone knew that they are scam projects. But, most of the time the project was not that obvious and made you think “it is great to put my money in”, and puff! Your money is gone like a fur in the wind. \n\nKnowing this it is great to know some of these scams and how they work. In this little article I am going to study some these scams and tell you exactly what they are and how they work.\n\n### 1. Giveaway Scam\n\nIn this scam you are going to be promised that if you give some cryptocurrency for example 1 $BTC you will be given 2 $BTC in return. So that is a “GIVE”away scam. Usually these kinds of scams try to convince you that they are eligible, using big names like “Elon Musk”, “CZ”, “Jack Dorsey”, “Bill Gates”, etc. \n\nThey will tell you that for example, Elon Musk, is giving away some cryptocurrency like $ETH and if you send 1 $ETH to an address you will be given 2 $ETH instantly. They might even show you a page with transactions that are “happening”, which they don’t. If you go to a block explorer you can see that only the input transactions are there and no outputs. These scams usually have a timer that ticking just to rush you to send your cryptocurrency to them, without enough considering. \n\nThese scams usually happen on Twitter. But it is not limited to Twitter only. They even happen on YouTube, Instagram, etc. In the YouTube scams, there is usually a live stream of some famous person to make it eligible for you that this is them who is giving away the cryptocurrency. But the footage is stolen from somewhere else.\n\n![An example of a giveaway scam](https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/03/31/17/bitcoin%20giveaway%20elon%20musk.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp)\n\nThis kind of scam is not new and it is not special to cryptocurrencies. It started as an e-mail from a Nigerian Prince. In this e-mail it was told that if you send some amount of money, for example $1000, they will send you $10,000 right away. And they need you to send some money to confirm your bank account. \n\n### 2. Rug Pull\n\nA rug pull is a scam promotion of a cryptocurrency token via social media. After the price has been driven up, the scammer sells, and the price generally falls to zero.\n\nOne of the most famous rug pulls is the scam project, “Squid Game”. In this scam the price of the token went up during promotions and advertisements, and just in a few seconds the scammers went all in and sold all of their token and the price fell over to zero.\n\n![Squid Game token rug pull](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_771+q_lossless+ret_img+to_webp/https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Squid-Game.png)\n\nThis scam is not just for fungible token. NFTs have been sold as a rug pull too. They promise a very great roadmap and price appreciation in the coming days and after this they g to some celebrities to advertise for them. After they minted and sold all the NFTs, they delete all the website, and every other footprint of themselves and they pull the rug out and you are on yourself with a valueless NFT.\n\nAll the rug pulls are not fast and in matter of seconds. In these slow rugs the creator slowly extricates themselves from the project over a number of weeks or months. Their goal is for the buyers to eventually lose interest and abandon their hopes. Slow rug is actually a lot more common than the quicker one, and usually it is harder to zone in on.\n\n### 3. Phishing Scams\n\nThis kind of scam is such that it is so hard to spot. These scams are not exclusively related to cryptocurrencies and have existed long before to grab important details from users. Details such as bank account information, e-mail account information, etc.\n\nPhishing is a type of online scam that targets consumers by sending them an e-mail that appears to be from a well-known source – an internet service provider, a bank, or a mortgage company, for example. It asks the consumer to provide personal identifying information. Then a scammer uses the information to open new accounts, or invade the consumer’s existing accounts.\n\nThese scams started working in the cryptocurrency space when they were used by hackers to get access to people’s exchange account details and steal their funds from there. However, noticing that how secure the exchanges became recently, the phishing schemes have evolved to start targeting users directly through their cryptocurrency wallets. One of the most damaging attacks is when the hacker is able to successfully phish the private keys or seed phrases. \n\nOne of the most common ways of getting these  for the hacker is to fool user into handing over the private keys or seed phrases. These will never be requested by anyone unless you are resetting your wallet. If someone is requesting your seed phrases or private keys, they are most certainly attackers who are going to take away all your funds from your wallets. \n\nAnother way is for the hackers to give you their seed words, when you download a new wallet, a FAKE wallet! In this attack they will give you their seed words of the wallet and as soon as you deposit funds into the wallet, they will take it right away. \n\n### 4. Impersonation Scams\n\nThis scam is not specific to cryptocurrency world, too. There are several variations of this scam. In many variations of this scam, it involves a phone call from someone purporting to be a government official (e.g. a police officer, immigration officer or court official) or staff from a bank or telecommunication service provider.\n\nIn this scam, the caller might claim to be a government official, an employee or representative of a Chinese bank or courier company. The caller might claim that your identity was used to send parcels containing fake passports or weapons, or to apply for overseas credit cards. They then refer you to another caller claiming to be a Chinese official, who will ask — or even threaten — you to give them personal information such as your passport or bank account number, internet banking credentials or One-Time Password (OTP).\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, the attackers usually impersonate themselves as someone known to people. For example, Elon Musk, CZ, Coin Bureau, Jack Dorsey, etc. This attacks usually happens in Twitter but it is not limited to this application. YouTube, Instagram, Telegram, e-mail, etc. can face this kind of attack. \n\n![Impersonations of Coin Bureau](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ppieAlrpUH_6FdrtmbNtm.png?height=877&width=872)\n\nIn this scam, the attacker usually provides a face account with name and profile picture similar to the real person and tries to respond to people commenting under a post of the real account, or they go to direct messaging of the application and try to fool you that they are the real person. Sometimes the attacker has more followers than the real person using bots and fake users. \n\nBut how can we make sure that the real person is the one that we are connecting with? In almost all of the social media platforms, there is a blue (or grey) tick that shows a verification for the real person. Also, you can find the real persons username using their website or other trusted ways like another social media that you trust the real person is behind the account. \n\n### 5. Ponzi Schemes\n\nA Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors. Ponzi scheme organizers often solicit new investors by promising to invest funds in opportunities claimed to generate high returns with little or no risk. In many Ponzi schemes, rather than engaging in any legitimate investment activity, the fraudulent actors focus on attracting new money to make promised payments to earlier investors as well as to

it is obvious, this kind of scamming is not specific to cryptocurrency world. Actually, Ponzi schemes have been around for ages and Ponzi schemers in cryptocurrency world are just copying the work of others and have usually have nothing new.\n\nIn the cryptocurrency world, there usually is a “cloud mining”, “lending”, or “trading bot” that “will give you money”. But actually, instead of making real money the schemer is paying someone above you or before you with your money and tries to make the network bigger by making a lot of trust that this scheme is working. After some time when the money in hand becomes large enough, the scammer will leave you empty-handed and runs off with your money.\n\n### 6. One Scam I Faced Myself\n\nIn this scam, the scammer had made an Ethereum address and had filled it with some large amount of $USDT. Now, the scammer just gave away their seed phrase to someone else claiming that they can’t take out the $USDT lying in there. In this scam, the scammer actually can take out the $USDT but they won’t just as a bait. Now, the poor user deposits some $ETH to provide the gas fee, and poof!\n\nThere has been a bot set on this specific address that withdraws every $ETH deposited to this address in a matter of seconds. Before you can do anything with the $ETH you deposited, it is gone instantly to another address. Now, it is time for you  to spread it out for the scammer. \n\nYou go to your friend with a bit more knowledge and tell them you have a wallet (you have the seed phrase, don’t you?), that you can’t take out $USDT from it. Your friend tries to put $ETH for the gas fee and again poof!\n\nThis will go on and on until someone with more knowledge or pessimistic enough finds out what actually is happening and stops you from depositing your $ETH to this address and give away your $ETH to the scammer.

负债\n\n作为企业主，我们必须做的事情应该是显而易见的：在不增加负债的情况下获得更多资产，即最大化资本。因此，Sombart 认为复式记账系统为过渡到以私人公司最大化资本，即资本主义为基础的社会提供了必要条件。 该系统的工作原理是从商家的日记帐（单项分类账）中获取交易清单并将它们转移到复式分类账中。通过在一个帐户中添加贷方并在另一个帐户中添加匹配的借方，每个项目都会进入复式记账系统。我举一个例子：你以 5 美元的价格卖掉了一件衬衫，而你原本是用 3 美元买的⁵。在复式系统中，您将：\n\n* 贷记您的库存账户（资产账户）3 美元。贷记，因为存货是通过贷记减少的资产账户。此信用会从您的库存中删除衬衫。\n* 借记您的“商品销售成本”账户（资本账户）3 美元。借方，因为你丢了一件衬衫，借方是资本账户的减少。\n* 借记您的现金账户（资产账户）5 美元。借记，因为现金是通过借记增加的资产账户。\n* 贷记您的“销售收入”账户（资本账户）5 美元。贷记因为销售收入是通过贷记增加的资本项目。\n\n有四个条目，因为此事务中发生了两件事。你失去了衬衫，你获得了 5 美元。将我们资本账户上的条目（商品销售成本和救助收入）相加，我们有 5 美元的贷方和 3 美元的借方，总贷方（资本增加）为 2 美元。 在复杂的业务中，资金和资产可能出于不同的原因进出不同的地方。两次输入事物可在不同位置提供同一事件的两个视图。您可以查看您的资本账户，了解导致借方（资本损失）的原因。同样，您可以查看您的现金账户以了解您的现金流量如何。正在吸走您的现金的东西可能会影响您的资本，也可能不会，例如，如果您正在偿还债务（记录在负债账户中）。复式记账系统使推理这些事情变得容易。 随着复式记账系统无处不在，它为企业、投资者和贷方提供了一种共同语言。来自复式记账系统的财务报表，如[资产负债表](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet)，成为企业展示其信誉或投资潜力的标准方式。这为投资者阶层铺平了道路，这是资本主义的一个基本特征，专门从事他们的分析。 再一次，我们不能肯定地说复式记账系统导致了资本主义。但在我看来，随着复式记账系统从意大利北部蔓延开来，西方世界在经济上重新定位于理性和系统地追求利润。 中央银行和法定货币——作为货币的账本条目（公元 1931 年） 在法定货币发明之前，分类帐条目总是衡量有形拥有或欠款的数量。分类账上的负债是其他人的资产，因为它代表了债务人将来必须转移给债权人的一定数量。那么，除非它可以兑换成有价值的东西，否则你怎么能让账本资产有价值呢？ 答案在于经济价值的基本理念。事物之所以有价值，有两个原因：\n\n* 获得经济利益（个人想要的东西）\n* 避免经济损失（个人不希望发生的事情）的一种手段\n\n由于前一个原因，用黄金兑换分类账条目赋予了它们价值。[亚当·斯密](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith)的以下引用说明了如何使用后一个原因通过税收系统赋予纸币价值：\n\n> *一个君主，如果他规定他的一定比例的税款应该用某种纸币支付，他可能会因此赋予这种纸币一定的价值。即使它的最终解除和赎回期限应该完全取决于王子的意志* *——亚当·斯密，[《国富论的性质和原因的探究》](https://archive.org/details/aninquiryintothe01smituoft)*\n\n 换句话说，坐牢对经济不利。政府有监狱。政府将人们因不缴纳税款而入狱。因此，让分类帐条目交换价值的方法很明显：通过将分类帐信用转移给您来让人们纳税。该方案由中央银行系统实现，大致实现如下：\n\n1. 银行被赋予特殊的法律权力。它被称为中央银行。该国政府在这家银行设有账户。\n2. 中央银行发行可在中央银行以信用方式赎回面值的纸币。\n3. 中央银行不会为任何东西赎回其负债。\n4. 政府只接受通过将其在中央银行的账户（通常通过商业银行）记入贷方，或用纸币支付来支付税款。\n\n有了这四点，就实现了一种新的分类帐技术。中央银行分类账上的数字神奇地具有价值，即使您无法将它们兑换成任何东西！ 英格兰银行 (BoE) 的历史很好地证明了上述情况（我已将满足上述标准标记）： [1844 年的《银行特许法》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Charter_Act_1844)赋予英国央行在发行纸币方面的有效垄断权(1)。英国央行可以将 1 英镑的钞票兑换成一个[Sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_(British_coin))（金币），或者可以转换为 1 英镑的存款（银行信贷）(2)。1931 年，[英国央行停止用黄金赎回他们的票据和存款](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/commodities/11330611/How-the-Bank-of-England-abandoned-the-gold-standard.html) (3)。现在，纸币只能兑换信用，反之亦然。金币过去和现在仍然是法定货币，但它们的交易价格比纸币高，所以用它们纳税是愚蠢的。英国央行的银行信贷和代理银行票据，现在实际上是唯一可以用来纳税的东西(4)。 很容易看出这项技术对政府来说是多么理想。事实上，地球上的每个政府都参与了某种中央银行系统。中央银行的信贷供应完全由政府任命的少数人控制。另一方面，黄金是元素周期表中的一种元素，在世界各地都可以找到。它的供应完全在政治领域之外。在将纸币从黄金中解放出来后，央行可以像使用任何其他资产一样使用其黄金。更重要的是，中央银行可以无限期地购买新资产，方法是用不可赎回的账本条目换取信贷。通常，这种权力用于根据经济数据和中央银行持有的经济理论来购买或出售政府债务以扩大或收缩货币供应量。 中央银行系统使账本数字而不是商品成为人类的货币。大多数人一生中大部分时间都在工作以获取报酬。现在，这具体意味着增加您的银行账户中的数字或获得中央银行票据。中央银行对人类状况造成了微妙但根本的变化。人类收集财富的主要动机从实物转向纸质和电子数据库上的分类账号码。\n\n## 分布式账本（2009 AD）\n\n就在不到 10 年前，一位名叫“中本聪”的匿名人士发表[了一篇](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)名为“比特币：一种点对点电子现金系统”的论文。其核心是一种称为“区块链”的新分类账技术。区块链在一个分散的点对点网络上运行，所有参与者就分类账的状态达成共识。这是第一个不是任何特定个人、团体或政府的工具的分类账。比特币是全世界的去中心化公共账本。 但是什么的公共分类账？好吧，就像在中央银行系统中一样，账本数字（比特币）就是货币本身。与中央银行信用一样，比特币不能兑换任何东西，但与中央银行信用不同，你不能用它纳税。为了拥有公共分类账，区块链只是一个公共分类账。奇怪的是，人们认为拥有这个账本上的条目是值得的。 关于人们为什么愿意为比特币号码放弃他们辛苦赚来的银行号码的完整理论不在本文的讨论范围之内。我打算下次再解释一下。作为起点，这里有一些分布式公共分类账具有中央银行分类账没有的属性：\n\n* 无许可：与中央银行或商业银行分类账不同，您不需要任何人的许可即可拥有条目。这与无法使用可靠电子金融系统的数十亿人尤其相关。出于这个原因，Ouroboros 背后的公司 IOHK 将于 2018 年在加纳、埃塞俄比亚和肯尼亚设立办事处⁶。\n* 没有中央权威：协议的运行是唯一决定系统下一个状态的东西。如果您信任该协议，那么您可以信任该系统。这也意味着除非协议定义了一种方法，否则无法在分类账上创造新资金。\n* 合约执行：区块链可以用编程语言进行扩展。复杂的合约可以用语言编写并在区块链上公开执行。\n* 公开：只要可以在区块链上表示，您就可以使用密码学证明您拥有某物或公开做过某事。\n* 可选匿名：您可以拥有一个条目而无需透露您的个人身份。\n\n这些属性本身并不意味着比特币或其他加密货币应该具有交换价值。但是，如果我们能够以某种方式假设它们有朝一日可以拥有可靠的稳定价值，那么很容易看出这些分类帐改变文明的潜力。\n\n## 未来\n\n上述每种分类账技术在其发明和早期开发时可能看起来都是良性的。只有回过头来看，他们的逻辑在社会中渗透了很多年之后，我们才能看到他们的意义。 分布式账本技术仍处于起步阶段。它已经在分类账的历史上赢得了自己的位置。像其他分类账发明一样，它可能在我们未来社会的发展中发挥重要作用。迄今为止，它最显着的影响是网络毒品市场的兴起、投机狂热和[一些养猫游戏](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)。只有时间会证明它是否会这样做！\n\n 注释：\n\n1. 还有其他较早的人类将符号划入事物的例子，但尚未证实更早使用实际有用的书面语言。\n2. <http://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=old_babylonian_scribal_schools>，“体积和容量单位之间的桥梁：1 sar-volume 相当于 60 gur（约 18 m3 或 18 000 升）” .\n3. <http://ianmorris.org/docs/social-development.pdf>，见 \\[9.2\\] 西部城市规模估计\n4.

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/556eut5ZLIkHLtN1z9H-9.png?height=590&width=1050)\n\n中本聪（Satoshi Nakamoto）开发的比特币和区块链的发展标志着彻底改变全球金融的潜力。然后，以太坊智能合约的引入使分散式应用程序（dApps）的增长超出了中心化公司的控制范围。但比特币和以太坊的性能都有限，导致许多人认为区块链本质上是缓慢、昂贵且难以扩展的。\n\n \n\n已经出现了一系列第1层协议，旨在改善不同用例中的这些缺点。尽管由于性能指标和数据的差异，很难比较区块链协议，但交易、可扩展性、节点和能源效率等元素可以帮助评估它们的相对优点。\n\n \n\n考虑到这一点，让我们根据这些参数比较六个区块链：\n\nEthereum ，Cardano ，Solana ，Avalanche，Algorand  和 Internet Computer 。\n\n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dsa7r6C-blCVsC8Smo_u6.png?height=1542&width=2048)\n\n \n\n**交易速度**\n\n \n\n决定区块链网络效率的关键指标之一取决于它处理交易的速度。这涉及两个具体方面：每秒交易量（TPS）和区块确定性或交易确定性。\n\n \n\nTPS是指区块链在一秒钟内可以成功处理多少笔交易；区块确定性表示区块启动与其在分布式账本上的最终不可逆结算之间的持续时间。\n\n \n\nCardano：2 TPS / 10-60 分钟确定性\n\n \n\n据称，Cardano可以处理 250 TPS，报告的块确定时间为 10 分钟到 1 小时，具体取决于网络拥塞情况。据称，其第 2 层扩展解决方案 Hydra 理论上可实现高达 100 万的 TPS 和瞬时区块确定性。但第三方测量显示，Cardano 目前仅支持大约 2 TPS。\n\n \n\nEthereum: 15-20 TPS / 14 分钟确定性\n\n \n\n以太坊通常处理 15-20 TPS，区块确定时间为 14 分钟。在极端网络拥塞期间，这个比率要高得多，完成交易可能需要 14 分钟以上。用户通常必须为每笔交易支付“gas”费用，具体取决于流量，去年达到 1000 美元的峰值。以太坊正试图纠正这一点，即将推出的分片和第 2 层扩展解决方案有望提高交易速度。\n\n \n\nAlgorand：20 TPS / 4-5 秒确定性\n\n \n\nAlgorand 理论上报告处理 1,200 TPS，并打算立即将其增加到 3,000 TPS。根据其指标页面，它实际上处理了 20 TPS。 Algorand 拥有 4-5 秒的区块确定时间。\n\n \n\nSolana：2,000-3,000 TPS / 21-46 秒确定性\n\n \n\nSolana 理论上可以处理 65,000 TPS，但在实践中，它处理大约 2,000-3,000 TPS。当交易在 2021 年 9 月达到 400,000 TPS 的峰值时，它遭遇了中断，引发了对其不稳定性的担忧。 Solana 的理论交易完成时间为 400-500 毫秒，但实际上“乐观确认”需要 21-46 秒。\n\n \n\nAvalanche：4,500 TPS / 2-3 秒确定性\n\n \n\nAvalanche 报告称其测试网可以处理 4,500 TPS，生产就绪版本最终目标是 20,000 TPS。但目前，对于 EVM 兼容的 C-Chain，它只能处理大约 9 TPS。 Avalanche 报告的交易完成时间不到一秒，但可能需要大约 2-3 秒。\n\n \n\nInternet Computer：11,500 TPS / 1 秒确定性\n\n \n\nInternet Computer 当前配置为处理高达 51,666 TPS，但最近的性能测试显示 11,500 TPS，dapp 的最终确定率为 1 秒。这种高比率是由于区块链将更新调用（状态增强）与查询调用（状态中立）区分开来。 Internet Computer 可以在几毫秒内处理超过 250,000 个只读查询调用。\n\n \n\n**可扩展性**\n\n \n\n当区块链支持高交易吞吐量并且可以增长以适应新用户时，它们是可扩展的。可扩展的区块链是网络流量不会显着影响整体性能的区块链。\n\n \n\nEthereum：不是很可扩展\n\n \n\n鉴于以太坊基于工作证明共识运行，以太坊目前的可扩展性不是很高，但它计划通过迁移到权益证明共识来增加容量和可扩展性。它的目标是拥有 64 个带有信标链的分片链，以实现进一步的可扩展性。\n\n \n\nCardano：不是很可扩展\n\n \n\nCardano 在扩展和增加容量的能力方面同样受到限制，但它的目标是在今年某个时候实施第 2 层 Hydra 升级，预计将允许在链上和链下处理相同的代码。\n\n \n\nSolana：不是很可扩展\n\n \n\nSolana 在 2021 年遭受了严重的“资源枯竭”，并在去年 1 月发生了六次中断，这表明其可扩展性有限。 Solana 的历史证明共识协议与 PoS 相结合，每年还会产生大量数据（2 TB）。 Solana 将数据存储在 Arweave 中，从而将敏感的用户数据外包给依赖集中式 Web2 技术的二级来源。\n\n \n\nAvalanche：不是很可扩展\n\n \n\nAvalanche 拥有三个链：交换链（X-Chain）、平台链（P-Chain）和合约链（C-Chain），每条链都管理着迷你网络。与 Solana 一样，Avalanche 也使用 Arweave 和 Ceramic 通过集中式 Web2 技术在链下存储数据，因为它没有自己的存储设施。\n\n \n\nAlgorand：更高的可扩展性\n\n \n\nAlgorand 使用权益证明共识的变体，称为纯权益证明，协议通过该共识选择区块提议者和验证者。利用称为可验证随机函数 (VRF) 的加密过程，Algorand 使用自选算法来选择块创建者。与标准的权益证明协议不同，这种方法可以快速跟踪计算过程并帮助 Algorand 进行扩展。\n\n \n\nInternet Computer：无限可扩展性\n\n \n\nInternet Computer 的基础设施在基础层具有独立的节点机器，这些节点机器结合起来形成独立的子网区块链。子网托管结合代码和数据的“罐式”智能合约，并将执行分为更新和查询调用。每个子网都可以在不依赖其他子网的情况下处理更新/查询调用，从而允许网络通过添加节点和形成新子网来根据需要进行扩展。\n\n \n\n**节点数和云服务依赖**\n\n \n\n区块链节点的数量及其分布是网络相对去中心化的有力指标。由于在链上存储智能合约数据的成本可能非常高，大多数 dApp 通常依赖于集中式服务器和云提供商（如 AWS、谷歌云、微软 Azure 和阿里云）来存储数据并托管其客户端-服务器接口。\n\n \n\nInternet Computer：443 个节点 / 每 GB 5 美元\n\n \n\nInternet Computer 拥有 443 个在全球独立数据中心运行的节点。没有一个是集中式云提供商。节点运营商有硬件要求，以确保区块链可以响应 HTTP 请求并在没有中介的情况下交付 Web 内容。每年存储 1 GB 数据的链上智能合约数据成本为 5 美元。\n\n \n\nAvalanche：1,243 个节点 / 每 GB 988,000 美元\n\n \n\nAvalanche 有使用 AWS 设置节点的文档，表明其 1,243 个节点中的很大一部分可能托管在 AWS 上。在链上存储 1 GB 数据的成本为 988,000 美元。\n\n \n\nSolana：1,603 个节点 / 每 GB 1,000,000 美元\n\n \n\n大多数 Solana 节点都托管在 AWS 等集中式服务器上。它的中断引发了人们的担忧，即如果 33% 的节点离线，Solana 将停止验证新交易。在 Solana 上存储链上数据大约需要 100 万美元。\n\n \n\nAlgorand：1,997 个节点 / IPFS 链下存储\n\n \n\nAlgorand 报告有大约 2,000 个节点，但它们托管在集中式服务器上。虽然没有确切的数字，但 Algorand 依靠 AWS 来扩展其网络。 Algorand 没有使用链上存储，而是使用星际文件系统 (IPFS) 来存储数据。\n\n \n\nCardano：3,173 个节点/数据存储不足\n\n \n\nCardano基金会与 IOHK 和 Emurgo 最初建立了运行网络的节点。他们将区块生产过程移交给了网络的权益池运营商，目前数量为 3,173。目前尚不清楚有多少是云服务。 Cardano 是一个仅可附加的分类帐，用于记录资产所有权和转移，对于永久存储文件是不切实际的。\n\n \n\nEthereum：6,000 个节点 / 每 GB 73,000,000 美元\n\n \n\n以太坊在全球拥有大约 6,000 个节点，其中大部分在集中式服务器上运行。 2020 年，Decrypt 报告称 70% 的以太坊节点在 AWS 上运行。在以太坊主网上存储 1 GB 数据的成本会波动，但目前成本超过 1 亿美元。\n\n \n\n**能源效率**\n\n \n\n区块链技术必须减少其碳足迹才能变得可持续。能源密集型工作证明共识对气候产生不利影响，因为矿工需要大量能源来为其设备供电。\n\n \n\n估计显示，每笔基于以太坊的交易消耗 238 kWh（千瓦时）的能源。 （作为参考，100,000 笔 VISA 交易消耗 149 kWh 的能源。）以太坊矿工每年消耗约 45 TWh（太瓦时）的能源。以太坊向权益证明的过渡预计将大大降低其能源消耗。\n\n \n\nInternet Computer 在链上运行的每笔交易消耗 1.3 千瓦时的能源，而不是外包给集中式云提供商。\n\n \n\n现有的权益证明区块链为单个交易消耗少量能量。 Cardano 单次交易仅消耗 0.5 kWh，而 Solana 上的交易消耗 0.00051 kWh 能量。 Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute 的一份报告显示，Avalanche 每笔交易消耗 0.00476 kWh，Algorand 每笔交易消耗 0.0027 kWh。然而，这些区块链中的每一个都将存储和托管外包给集中式服务器，这其中含有隐藏的碳足迹无法被直观计算。\n\n \n\n**跨链桥**\n\n \n\n区块链网桥支持在两条独立链之间传输数据包和数字资产。 Cardano 依靠 Force Bridge 与 Nervos 区块链进行交易，并与 Bondly 合作连接以太坊和 Cardano NFT。 Avalanche 使用 Avalanche Bridge 与以太坊执行资产转移。\n\n \n\nAlgorand 最终将使用伦敦桥与以太坊连接。同样，Swingby 正在开发 Skybridge 以将比特币与 Algorand 连接起来，而 Solana 使用 Wormhole 与以太坊连接。黑客最近从 Wormhole 窃取了价值 3.2 亿美元的加密货币，各种漏洞利用表明桥梁如何容易受到恶意行为者的黑客攻击。根据 Chainalysis 的研究，在过去一年中，黑客在七起事件中窃取了超过 10 亿美元的加密货币。\n\n \n\nInternet Computer 具有连接以太坊的 Terabethia 桥接器。它还支持无桥的链间集成，仅依赖于区块链的去信任属性。现在它正在与比特币网络集成，为开发人员提供一个 API 来构建比特币智能合约。与以太坊和狗狗币的集成将随之而来。\n\n \n\n**最终用户密钥管理**\n\n \n\n区块链的采用仍然相当缓慢，因为用户对需要安全存储选项的安全密钥管理持谨慎态度。 Facebook 和 Google 等 Web2 应用程序依赖于简单的单点登录 (SSO) 解决方案。而对于大多数 Web3 dApp，用户必须使用复杂的私钥并设置加密钱包才能访问平台。\n\n \n\n在Internet Computer上，用户可以使用移动设备的指纹传感器、面部识别、安全密码、锁定图案等在本地设置 Internet 身份。互联网身份帮助用户匿名验证自己，而不用担心私钥。它还适用于“反向gas”模型，开发人员按周期向智能合约收费，因此用户无需持有代币来支付gas。\n\n \n\n以太坊依靠 AWS 等中心化公司来存储密钥和管理账户，而 Solana 依靠 Torus 等利用 Facebook 或 Google 账户提供平台访问权限的解决方案。不幸的是，这损害了区块链技术的去中心化精神。\n\n \n\nAvalanche 用户需要管理自己的密钥，类似于 Cardano 用户和 Algorand 用户，这可能涉及复杂的密钥和代币钱包。\n\n \n\n**区块链性能**\n\n \n\n总的来说，性能最佳的区块链是在各种用例（即 DeFi、NFT、游戏和各种 dApp 等）中为开发人员和用户提供最大价值的区块链。为此，需要了解给定的 Layer 1 协议在开发人员和用户体验方面提供了什么，以及其生态系统和相关能力的承诺。\n\n \n\n超越性能指标，看看上面讨论的每个区块链网络在不久的将来会发生什么，这将会很有趣。\n\n \n\n \n\n**原文链接：[https://coincodex.com/article/14198/layer-1-performance-comparing-6-leading-blockchains/](https://weibo.cn/sinaurl?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcoincodex.com%2Farticle%2F14198%2Flayer-1-performance-comparing-6-leading-blockchains%2F)**\n\n**翻译：千帆**\n\n**审编：XL**\n\n \n\n**加入欧科链讯社区，掌握区块链世界最新动态！**\n\n**电报频道：https://t.me/ok_telegraph**\n\n**电报社区：https://t.me/ok_telegraph_forum**\n\n**Twitter：欧科链讯**\n\n**电报搜索“欧科链讯”关注我们不迷路哦\\~​**",

{"id": "zJqBFzOVbl7zYoL2HkkR38EkqecjwhQupAkIbM4BCz4", "title": "DID 与 SocialFi 将走的路：找寻 Web3 的灵魂", "body": "> 作者：Diamond, Diane, Maxwell, Evelyn, Carole, Claire\n> Twitter: <https://twitter.com/D_TigerResearch>\n> Discord: <https://discord.gg/CZCM7WesKS>\n\n## 1. Vitalik 等论文摘要\n\n《去中心化社会：找寻 Web3 的灵魂》是 Vitalik 等人联合发表的最新论文，本文讲述了如何通过 “灵魂绑定” Token（本质上来说就是 DID）来建立一个更加多元、丰富的 Desoc（去中心化社会）。论文内容非常长，本文将对这篇论文的重要观点进行转述与总结，这样读者很快就能了解去中心化社会有关知识了。\n\n### 1.1 Web3成立之初的局限性\n\n在不到十年的时间里，Web3 创造了一个庞大的金融帝国，这一成就令世界瞩目，连 facebook 都以 all in 的形式参与到这场金融盛宴之中。加密和经济领域的基础元素，为金融交易带来了一个丰富、开放且多元的生态系统。但是这个过程中出现了一个矛盾，金融交易的经济价值是由人们现实生活中的社会关系等决定的，也就是说它的内部运转逻辑并不完善甚至可以说并不完整。正是由于 Web3 缺乏代表社会身份的基础元素，它从根本上依赖于它所要超越的中心化的 Web2 结构，这具有非常大的局限性。\n\n这种依赖性在具体应用方面也有很明显的体现：\n\n* 虽然 NFT 通过 Opensea 等去中心化平台进行交易，但是许多 NFT 艺术家会通过 Twitter 等中心化平台进行宣传，以向人们证明其真实性并达到推广的目的\n* 各种去中心化项目经常依赖 Web2 基础设施来实施投票\n* 许多 Web3 参与者依赖 Coinbase 或 Binance 等中心化实体管理的托管钱包\n\n此外由于缺乏原生的 Web3 身份，今天的 DeFi 生态系统无法支持实体经济中普遍存在的活动，如等额抵押贷款甚至超低额抵押贷款（目前加密贷款平台一般只支持超额抵押）或者签订公寓租赁等合同。在此我们试图通过“灵魂绑定”的 Token（“soulbound” tokens，SBTs，也就是 DID 去中心化身份）来打破这些局限。除此以外通过 Web3 社会身份，还可以就财富集中和金融攻击的治理脆弱性等更广泛的长期问题上取得巨大进展，同时刺激 web3 的政治、经济和社会应用的大幅发展。我们把这些用例和它们所促成的更丰富的多元生态系统称为“去中心化社会”（DeSoc）。**本文第二部分会就 web2 的社交与 Desoc 进行对比进一步展示出 Desoc 的一些特点与优势。**\n\n### 1.2 Desoc 的要素与畅想\n\n首先我们应先了解一下 DeSoc 的基本元素，它（“灵魂绑定” Token, SBTs） 围绕着人们持有的不可转让的账户（或钱包），代表着承诺、证书和关系，这种 Token 就像一份扩展的简历。可以简单地把这种东西理解为我们的身份证，有了身份证我们就可以缴纳社保、绑定银行卡等。没有身份证或者说法律认可的身份这些都很难实现，而目前的 web3 就处在这种没有身份证明的困局当中。在这里把起身份证明的东西被称为“灵魂”， 将账户持有的 Token 称为“灵魂 Token”（SBTs）。\n\n想象一下这样一个世界，大多数参与者都有“灵魂 Token”，它对应一系列的关系、会员资格和证书。因此人们不用公开自己的真实身份，就可以让他人看到自己的教育证书，就业历史，或自己的著作或艺术作品的一串哈希值，这种 Token 对相关信息的公开类似于人们在简历中分享关于自己的信息。更重要的是，通过这种身份人们可以互相识别，甚至可以实现目前无法达到的等额抵押、合同签订等。人们甚至可以无纸化，因为数据可以记录一切，并且因为它不可篡改的特点，又让一切变得更加可信。在这些技术的支持下 web3 一定会越来越丰富且美好。\n\n### 1.3 相关实例\n\n**艺术与“灵魂”**\n\n艺术家可以通过“灵魂”将作品与自己连接。当发行可交易的 NFT 时，艺术家可以从他们的“灵魂”中发行 NFT。艺术家的“灵魂”携带的 SBTs 越多，买家就越容易识别出“灵魂”是属于该艺术家的，从而也就能确定 NFT 的真实性。艺术家可以更进一步，在他们的“灵魂”中发布一个链接的 SBTs，证明某个 NFT 是该“系列藏品”的成员。因此，“灵魂”将创造一种可靠的、链上的交易和识别方式。 很明显，它的现实应用还有很多，NFT 艺术家的例子只是其中最具有代表性的。实际上，除了 web3 领域外，它也能有解决一些现实问题，比如知识产权、司法文件真伪判断等。毕竟随着深度造假技术的进步，人类和算法的直接检查将越来越无法检测真实性。虽然区块链的加入使我们能够追踪特定作品的制作时间，但 SBTs 将使我们能够追踪相关内容的社会出处，为我们提供丰富的社会背景，让我们了解发布作品的人的“灵魂”——他们的会员资格、关系、证书的组合。通过这种方式“高仿”可以很容易地被识别出来。\n\n**“灵魂”空投**\n\n在具体说明“灵魂”空投之前我们需要明白空投是什么，以及空投的意义到底是什么？区块链领域的空投是一种将数字货币通过区块链技术大规模分发到一些已有的数字货币钱包上的行为，比如以太币、比特币、EOS.IO 钱包。简单来说就是向广大网友“发钱”的过程。\n\n当面对空投人们会有四种行为：（1）上网搜索相关内容（2）和朋友聊相关内容，使朋友知晓有关信息（3）之前或者之后疯狂注册账号，以获得空投（4）直接无视\n\n空投本身是一种非常流行的营销策略，并不是所谓的“慈善”，因此在上述几种情况中，（3）和（4）属于无效空投，并不能带来实际的收益或者说宣传的效果。而其中的第三条属于危害性最大的一条，也就是常说的女巫攻击。为了避免第三条项目方往往设立许多空投限制，但是很明显并不能完全避免。通过 DID 可以有效解决上述问题，因为项目方可以依据 DID 进行空投，可以有效提高投放的精准性和准确性。\n\n论文中的相关例子还有很多这里就不多做列举了，如果感兴趣可以点击[论文原文](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763)进行细致了解。\n\n很显然，上文那两个所谓的相关实例都还是比较理想化的概念。**本文将于第三部分举出一些现有的比较具有代表性的相关去中心化项目，各位读者可以通过这些例子对相关内容予以把握。同时会在第四部分就上文提到的 DID 的使用、价值和发展前景进行详细的说明。**\n\n### 1.4 结论\n\n通过这篇文章大家可以预见到 Desoc 的美好未来，但同时也需要意识到 DID 只是这一远大历程中的一小步。此外，上面描述的场景只是 DeSoc 对现有项目与应用的强化作用，但是并没有涉及对比如物理、政治、社会以及它们与现实世界的复杂关系的描述，而它们实际上占据了我们现实生活的很大比例。所有这些都表明，上面描绘的远大理想，可能只是 DeSoc 最终形态的“雏形”。**论文中就 SBTs 的威胁与挑战也进行了比较细致的描述，在本文的第五部分将结合现实情况进行细致描写这里就不再细说。**\n\n# 2.  新型社交为何悄然而至\n\n### 2.1 Web2.0 传统社交弊病\n\nWeb2.0本质是平台经济，是以一小撮为代表的垄断性寡头构架，互联网在该阶段变成全民级别应用，聚集了社交、搜索、电商等超级生态应用开发，且每个行业领域龙头公司几乎垄断行业资源和发展上限，这使得Web2公司在拥有最终解释权的情况下去剥削和占有用户资源信息时游刃有余，例如微信和QQ在中国产生的影响力和不可置换性，使得用户无法维护本身利益，用户在Web2.0中更像是平台的附庸而不是服务接收者。而Web3.0是属于Token经济的后端程序革命，其本意是在为非平台内部的生态参与者获取更多的话语权和创造权，并拥有产品本身的价值支配权利，以及隐私性和安全性。一定程度的避免了不平衡的垄断机制。\n\n### 2.2 SocialFi 是 Web3.0 的必要组件\n\nSocialFi的出现是对抗传统社交平台弊端的必要产物，Web2.0 时代的社交平台被各大运营巨头控制，从用户数据中获取商业价值，忽略用户的感受。SocialFi基于区块链技术，用户身份信息的匿名性有助于保护隐私和安全，更有利于解决用户数据的确认问题以及权利下放。\n\n相信随着用户对于隐私以及自由的追求，越来越多的人会投身于Web3.0的世界，在用户渴望加密技术带给的数据主权时也渴望获得自己在这个世界独特的身份和地位。在Web2.0-3.0过渡的过程中，互联网用户需要一些中间件来从简单迁移到复杂，从而从原始空间迁移到元空间。元空间的实现需要从现有的互联网世界出发，利用一系列的Web3.0组件，分批分阶段的迎接新的用户。在尝试了Defi的去中心化资产流、NFT的数字工作价值、发现Gamefi的P2E之后，去中心化的意见发布和个人展示已经下一个需要探索和开发的Web3.0组件，在互联网发展历史中可以发现社交化可以说是网民的刚性需求。\n\n### 2.3 线上数据分析\n\n根据[Zippa](https://www.zippia.com/advice/cryptocurrency-statistics/)的统计以及交易平台和钱包的来源，2018-2020 年全球加密货币用户群增加了近 190%，2021 年进一步加速。 数据的增加可能是由于账户数量的增加以及身份识别的改进，以及在 2021 年特斯拉和万事达卡等公司宣布进军加密货世界等从热度上升带来的用户数量造成的。下图展示了Web3.0近几年来的趋势变化：         \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jov7Glf5pfabWlpkN1DD0.png?height=482&width=1141)\n\n根据Google Search数据统计，如今的互联网 2.0 使用用户约在 49.5 亿人左右，对标3亿的加密用户都还只是冰山一角。绝大多数的互联网用户都害困在传统社交网络中，让加密应用的热度扩散才是Web 3.0 走向主流用户的最关键一步。\n\n# 3. 理念的实际运用\n\n### 3.1 ENS\n\nENS”，全称 Ethereum Name Service， 是一个基于以太坊区块链的分布式，开放，可扩展的命名系统。简单来说，通过它可以把原本难以记忆的以太坊地址变成自定义的短地址。通过这种方式，人们可以轻易记下有关内容，既可以减少工作的繁琐程度，也可以减少不必要的风险。同时让用户可以通过以太坊账户和 ENS 配置文件控制自己的数字身份，不再依赖于传统的“中介”。\n\n**技术**\n\n这往往是在注册中心和解析器实现的：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KxP_2muLbCWAntIOITBtl.png?height=458&width=486)\n\nENS注册中心由一个智能合约组成，该合约维护所有域和子域的列表，并存储所有域和子域的三个关键信息：\n\n* 域的所有者\n* 域的解析器\n* 域下所有记录的缓存时间\n\nENS 注册中心作用很简单，只是为了从名称映射到负责它的解析器。解析器负责将名称转换为地址。任何有相关功能的合约都可以作为ENS中的解析器。\n\n在ENS中解析名称有两个步骤：首先，询问注册中心是哪个解析器负责该名称，其次，请该解析器回答查询。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/duhbK48dgxF77doKkPN3t.png?height=254&width=467)\n\n比如，我们试图找到\"foo. eth\"指向的以太坊地址。首先，我们询问注册中心哪个解析器负责“foo. eth”。然后，我们向解析器查询“foo. eth\"的地址。\n\n**数据**（截止至2022-05-23）\n\nDiscord关注：4万+\n\nTwitter关注：18.3万\n\n数据显示，以太坊域名服务商 ENS 在 5 月份以来的收入已经达到了 802 万美元，创下今年以来的新高。今年以来 ENS 已经累计获得了 4864 万美元的收入。\n\n**小结**\n\n通过运作流程可以看出来，整个过程并不会侵害用户的隐私，但是又为加密交易和地址记忆提供了便利条件。V神曾评论说：“ENS是迄今为止最成功的非金融类以太坊应用程序，基本可以类比为一个去中心化的电话册”。很明显它是前文所提到的 Desoc 的一个现实应用和技术支撑，随着行业的发展具有非常巨大的发展潜力。\n\n### 3.2 Bright ID\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wuZhsWQvRKNVOjwoLfTC_.png?height=609&width=1920)\n\nBrightID 是 Web3.0 用户的身份系统，基于以太坊开发，它是完全独立于传统和互联网身份认证的系统。一般用于DAPP用户验证；活动验证；信誉构建等。\n\n具有以下特点：\n\n无门槛：任何人都有权利拥有 Bright ID。\n\n隐私性：Bright ID 不会向用户索取或捕获任何个人隐私信息。\n\n开源：公共产品，完全免费且开源。\n\n**运作和验证方式**\n\nBrightID需要经过人脸和多人认证的方式来通过审核。认证结合链下会议视频等非隐私信息渠道的方式，采用视频会议的形式，由以上六位验证官负责主持验证会议并进行验证工作。验证会议的具体时间日历可在 BrightID 官网查看。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gp05mZ9Gx-tgYSiH2uGga.png?height=354&width=1280)\n\n**相关数据**\n\n融资信息\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BmJ3Z3sIoWc7xg5mA4WAk.png?height=70&width=514)\n\nMetaCartel 是一个由软件工程师、创业者以及以太坊爱好者构建的去中心化社区。他们在全球拥有600多名成员，他们具有丰富的领域经验和专业技能。已经为很多此领域最受欢迎的新兴项目提供了早期资金：Mintbase；Known Origin；Kickback；RocketNFT；Gelato Finance等。\n\n数据分析(截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注：13.2K\n\nAPP 融合：13款\n\nBright ID 用户：57K+\n\n**合作方：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySb7HH2E3tUyY-Zz9BFgX.png?height=471&width=1323)\n\n**小结**\nBrightID 在Web3.0时代扮演着很重要的角色，DAPP&APP、活动组织都采用 BrightID 进行身份验证。但这仅仅是 BrightID 潜力的一小部分，随着 BrightID 产品的迭代，以及其构建的信任网络不断扩大，将成就 BrightID 无限的可能性。\n\n### 3.3 MetaMask\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0n_GpHSQzK8HF-UjI7TT-.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nMetaMask，又或是人们口中常说的“小狐狸”钱包，日益成为加密圈内不可或缺的工具，你的钱包地址在一定程度上，可以代表你个人在链上的身份。\n\nMetaMask是一个通过web2互联网浏览器就能访问，且以低门槛与以太坊网络进行交互的工具钱包。它是Consensys目前面对终端用户的唯一产品，是以太坊最早的钱包之一，也是目前用户量最大的钱包。始于2015年，长期以网页端、免费、“半官方”的形态为大众所熟知，属于非托管型钱包。随着2020年Defi应用热潮与2021年NFT的火爆市场效应，MetaMask的用户量极速增长。2020年新增手机客户端和交易功能（名为Swap）。2021年5月推出MetaMask机构版，让机构用户能将MetaMask与机构级托管结合、方便工作流管理、易于汇报等。\n\n但起初，MetaMask其实并不是作为钱包插件之类的消费者项目，而是希望成为一种开发工具。Metamask母公司，是以太坊联合创始人Joseph Lubin所创办的区块链巨头公司之一的ConsenSys。ConsenSys 是以太坊重点项目的企业孵化器，旗下的MetaMask是ConsenSys布局的六大业务板块基础设施板块的重点项目。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YnjEZyE-akF8hkOslm1UO.png?height=188&width=839)\n\n**技术**\n\n现MetaMask已兼容绝大部分的区块链网络Dapp（包括Ethereum、Binance、Polygon），可集成托管解决方案来管理秘钥存储和多重签名批准。团队也在逐步优化产品本身，简化交易流程、减少交易费用、签字程序等。并逐步提升其合规能力，让钱包内可以进行高风险评估，安全进行去中心化和匿名交易等。\n对于大量的用户选择MetaMask作为迈入Web3的第一步，团队除了打磨好产品，提升钱包本身的安全性能，用户友好度之外。面对发展迅猛的加密货币行业，使用需求量的暴增与跨网络的需求都是不可忽视的问题。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pzMu5CxfcUo_ekJI1Ma9l.png?height=419&width=1445)\n\n**相关数据（截止到2022-05-23）**\n\n**Twitter关注**：75.4 K\n\n**融资情况**：2022-03-16，ConsenSys 完成4.5亿美元D轮融资，完成最新一轮融资后，ConsenSys的估值超过70亿美元，比2021年11月完成2亿美元C 轮融资时的估值增加一倍以上。ConsenSys首席执行官Joe Lubin在接受Decrypt采访时表示，MetaMask很快将推出DAO并发行代币。新的DAO并不会参与管理MetaMask，但将为MetaMask的更新提供资金。可见，MetaMask的资金储备是比较充足的。\n\n**其他数据**：\n\n根据公开数据，截止目前，MetaMask的月活跃用户已达到3000万。而巅峰时期的以太坊全网活跃地址也才只有 800 万左右。不难看出，Meta钱包的月活跃数量远超于此，也印证了MetaMask钱包现在已经成为了大量加密的首选。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZijDJTKGeNWtZC7Higmnt.png?height=804&width=1526)\n\n截止到2022年3月份，MetaMask插件的下载了超过1,000,000，目前日活跃用户大概在6k-8k左右，每日新用户超过2K+。目前加密货币钱包类用户早已超过8000万，对于一些出现的维护问题，团队已出现了棘手的情况。\n\n相较于互联网46亿的活跃用户来说，加密货币未来的将拥有更广阔的市场。目前MetaMask主要支持以太坊和各种EVM链，未来若想跨接到Solana等多生态，团队将如何开拓和维系其服务，值得期待。\n\n**小结**\n\n如今，MetaMask的使用已相当普及，这似乎已成为了进入Web3的第一步——生成你的去中心化钱包地址。而钱包也逐渐成为区块链世界中的一种身份象征，作为用户使用频率最高的小狐狸钱包，swap与NFT购买，是其最常用的两个功能。也因为以太坊生态中任何一个应用，都会支持MetaMask，两者的发展相辅相成，逐渐将钱包地址与Web3世界里去中心化个人身份的划上等号。\n未来，伴随着多链时代的到来，通用钱包的概念或将被逐渐被弱化，取而代之的可能是针对性更强的点对点产品服务，如专门的NFT钱包，打金钱包等。随着时间的推移，MetaMask自身以及新生代的钱包的发展都同样值得期待\n\n### 3.4 CyberConnect \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eXmS6-XLpYtKe3eZn9mQm.png?height=77&width=346)\n\nCyberconnect旨在解决社交图表（Social Graph）再分配问题，这个问题其实很好去解释，就是说Web2.0中各种平台的信息无法互通，造成重复资源浪费且难以找到各种志同道合的用户，社交图谱相对单一。\n\n而Cyberconnect所表明的内涵或者本质也很简单（用户之间的关系不仅仅是双向或者三向的，更是各种交叉和重叠的混合网络关系）例如A本身，与A关注的用户，和关注A的用户进行不同连线组合，形成一张独特的“图谱”，证明该用户的社交关系网，而从这些与用户A有联系的人又重新编织，又将形成新的图谱。这样网络世界中拥有相同的兴趣爱好的用户，同游戏玩家，商品贸易中的的买家卖家等通过社交图谱逐渐变得清晰。**如此一来，CyberConnect 便打破了不同平台之间的壁垒。**\n\n**技术**\n\n关于数据和存储：CyberConnect社交图数据存储时使用的IPFS和无许可协议Ceramic构建，联通Ceramic区块链锚定和自定义数据固定服务，可以保证CyberConnect链上数据长期存储。（使用Ceramic DID方法）关于用户数据在不同的平台如何集成，则需要采用Ceramic身份协议IDX，它为开发人员提供一个统一的界面，在CyberConnect内部查询这些数据分析，反过来CyberConnect也会给与DID链上系统提供更多的身份数据。\n\n与其它项目集成：同时CyberConnect还会与其它Web3项目集成获取信息，例如NFT平台Foundation与Rarible等，其实最重要的一点是让玩家通过一个统一的身份来参与不同种类的生态应用，同时也能与Web2链接使链上和链下数据结合起来成为更强大的去中心化数据提供商。\n\n**相关数据：**(数据截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注数：57,7k+\n\n生态项目数：30+\n\n入驻用户：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a7o2JaOaNfPgndwT2sSm3.png?height=108&width=679)\n\n融资消息：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MKRShXhLUbStaV7wGpQdV.png?height=127&width=685)\n\n其中的Multicoin曾投资过Near Protocol、Solana、Helium、Duna Analytics、Audius等潜力新兴区块链或者具有足够实际应用的优质Web3.0应用，此次Cyberconnect也正是该机构看好未来web3社交领域的潜力而开展的首次社交应用投资，证明该赛道的早期成长属性和该项目未来价值发掘。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgkZfhUF3wFkZo_i2RlCP.png?height=542&width=1145)\n\n**小结**\n\n社交化图标也是DID最核心应用场景之一。毕竟身份的重要程度随着社交功能完善等比例增长。虽然目前Cyberconnect已经接入Solana、Ethereum、Binance网络链，在用户体验感上来说，以太坊网络链是功能较完善且操作流畅，但部分操作功能在Solana上还处于开发阶段，不仅容易在网络上造成拥堵而且需要使用不同的钱包插件，使得用户体验感下降。\n\n作为一个去中心化的社交图谱协议，为Web3.0社会网络和元宇宙服务，CyberConnect还需要在前进的道路上完成更多的目标。\n\n### 3.5 Mirror\n\n提到去中心化的写作平台，大部分区块链用户都会脱口而出“Mirror”，其平台在成立不到一年就被联合广场风险投资公司估值1亿美元，获1千万美元投资。作为去中心化的写作平台赛道代表——Mirror 是依靠哪些去中心化特性和功能”荣登“宝座呢？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jylJj2d9u5m_YMYfOnvQA.png?height=601&width=865)\n\n**功能简介**\n\nMirror 跟中心化的写作平台最大的不同是，他具备加密区块链产品的特性和功能。参与用户无需通过邮箱账号，手机号码，社交帐户等中心化的身份验证手段来注册账号，只需要绑定自己的0x开头的钱包地址即可生成独一无二的“作者专栏”，类似于上文所提及的ENS（以太坊域名）。对于部分创作者来说，跟外界的接触仅仅由一串小小的字符连接，完美的融合了去中心化身份的理念。\n\n除此之外，创作者可以在Mirror平台上发布文章/创作图片等作品，每一件公开发布的作品不是保存在中心化服务器上，而是透过区块链存储专案Arweave进行链上的数据保存，经用户进行加密签名后生成一段哈希值记录，将作品永久的保存在区块链上。Mirror上更是支持创作者将自己的作品铸造成NFT，让原先没有边际成本、可被无限复制的内容作品具有稀缺性，从而被赋予价值。不仅无法被他人复制或修改，而且可以在各大NFT市场上进行售卖。\n\n其次，Mirror

Mirror 的存储组件-Arweave，是一条针对存储进行了底层性能优化的公链，因此用户在 Arweave 链上存储数据的成本相较其他智能合约公链平台有极大的降低。同时，链上存储的特征保证了在 Arweave 之上存储数据的永久性，因此，基于 Arweave 的存储模式也常被归类为永久存储。创作者在保存文章修改的时候，Mirror 会在后台自动对新的文章进行二次上链存储。\n2. Mirror 的确权组件，在存储的同时，通常会需要另一组 Web3 组件，以便对存储的内容进行确权，也就是将内容铸造为 NFT 格式的资产。但此步骤是在以太坊网络上以 NFT 的形式进行确权，成本由创作者自行承担支付。\n\n**相关数据（截至2022-05-23）**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XVwj7o6LqQYrJBLA3h4dT.png?height=70&width=698)\n\n**小结**\n\n去中心化创作平台-Mirror 的核心创新点很多，打破了传统创作平台的束缚，将NFT，社区DAO，Write-Fi相结合的经济模型，解决了部分去中心化平台所追求的“通过创作内容实现价值变现”的难题，相信 Mirror 这样肩负着去中心化任务的创作平台也会在迈向 WEB3.0 的道路上越走越远。\n\n### 3.6 Project Galaxy\n\nProject Galaxy 的愿景是想要打造一个最大的 Web3 数据凭证（credential data）网络，建造一个开放协作数据聚合基础设施，助力开发者和项目方建造更好的产品和社区。项目方在 Project Galaxy 平台上面为用户创建并奖励 NFT，用户完成项目方的任务，比如在链上进行特定的交互、参加会议、关注推特、加入 Discord 社区、提交问卷、参与测试等方式获得NFT。\n\n**技术：**\n\nProject Galaxy 目前支持两种方式来提供数据凭证 GraphQL 和 REST API。Galaxy上有两个角色，分别是数据贡献者和使用者。数据贡献者可以用子图查询或静态快照（subgraph queries or static snapshots）的方式贡献链上数据，同时在链下，Galaxy 也集成了信息来源，比如推特和 GitHub。\n\n数据使用者使用 Application module, Credential Oracle Engine, and Credential API 三种方式使用数据。并使用 Galaxy 的代币 $GAL 支付，因此数据贡献者可以获得激励。\n\n**相关数据**：\n\n已入驻项目方：400+\n\nGalaxy ID 用户：170 万+\n\nTwitter关注：30 万+\n\n融资情况：2021 年 5 月种子轮融资，2022年1月由 Multicoin Capital 和 Dragonfly Capital 领投、多个机构参投的 1000 万美元融资。随后 2 月在 CoinList 平台公募获得 1500 万美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gZN7tj9iV2lHWkssLK7Z3.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nProject Galaxy上线时间为2021年5月，运行不到一年，活跃用户量远大于同类型的项目 POAP 和 Rabbithole 。2021 年底银河女孩系列 NFT 活动让 Project Galaxy 一举成名，银河女孩 NFT 持有者更是获得了该项目原生代币 $GAL 在 CoinList 平台上公募的优先队列名额。后续 Meta Cowboy，Dr.SOL 等系列 NFT 持有者也获得了 $GAL 空投。\n\n**小结**\n\nProject Galaxy 无疑是一个非常成功的项目。链上身份凭证和数字身份一直都有市场需求，Project Galaxy 作为多链项目满足了市场在这方面的需求，为整个加密生态系统提供服务。在经历 Defi Summer 和 NFT Summer 之后 ，它抓住了 Crypto 项目方频繁使用 NFT 作为用户激励工具的需求。它给项目方提供了发放 NFT 奖励活动的工具和用户流量资源，初步形成了项目方和项目方之间，项目方和用户之间，用户和用户之间的多重网络效应。\n\n# 4. 新型社交的展望\n\n### 最初的载体与未来场景？\n\n绝大部分用户最熟悉DID理念实际运用应该是区块链钱包，例如Metamask是作为用户接入整个区块链的入口端，具有隐私性、安全性、不可追踪性。这是DID赛道最初应用成果，但是其缺点也很明确。钱包地址的注册缺少独特性，一个人可以注册大量毫无价值的钱包。其次大钱包只能显示代币难以展示NFT和参与证明等未来势必流行的资产，更不用说SBT所畅享的“无纸化”证明，这是钱包的局限性。第三钱包无法配置资产可编程属性，无法限制其他人查看钱包资产，从而导致黑客攻击情况发生。不过理念的实践是处于不断完善的过程。现在已经出现了可以展示NFT和参与证明（POA）的去中心化身份应用，还有隐私赛道对于钱包和其它DID应用进行代币隐私化、资产可视化等功能赋能等，预计不短时间内所有区块链赛道应用可以进行用户DID绑定，可记录用户等额抵押、合同签订、参与证明和哈希参数等不可篡改的数据，潜在提升单一用户DID价值\n\n从结构和理论上来阐述，有社交的地方更加注重身份特征，所以从根本属性上来说SocialFi就是实现该理念的最初赛道，只有用户们尝试并参与进来，才能够从本质上理解DID在区块链各赛道中重要程度，在未来去中心化社交领域当中，寻找相同理念思想的用户从而构建和谐关系，通过新兴匹配技术进行身份特征快速转移和整合，快速的梳理出用户兴趣爱好与社交圈，可以大程度的减少网络中诈骗行为，提高社交沟通交流效率。\n\n### 如何评估用户DID价值赋能？\n\n未来DID账号的价值根据其内部的资产总数和分配比例，如加密货币、NFT、参与证明等进行价值评估，以及个人身份信息验证，与其他用户之间互动，评论留言等进行附加属性评估。最后就是项目之间的筛选机制和会员资格评判，如拥有某些NFT或者证明的用户获得相应空投奖励、参与测试的资格等，这些都进一步的丰富了DID整体价值属性。\n\n对于目前市场来说，DID基础设施赛道仍未出现热点项目能引领该赛道的热潮，例如DeFi的火热是Uniswap带领的，GameFi的出圈前者与Axie有关，后者StepN再次引领，所以扩大潜在用户群体还需要落实到实际具体项目当中，单一可行的理念是无法吸引到足够的投资者的。\n\nDID赛道本身是没有主动生产价值的能力，创建了钱包地址不代表钱包有钱，但是从另一角度来说DID也是最能兼容区块链中所有领域的基础设施，其价值决定极大程度上基于与其它项目应用的兼容，毕竟DID属于后端程序，与个性化应用并不冲突。\n\n### 趋势预测\n\n在如今整体环境影响下，以NFT和GameFi赛道为首的炒作属性偏高的赛道整体估值下降较多，新用户和资金参与量明显下跌，而以Web 3.0等基础设施属性较强的底层架构融资情况增长。可以明确的是DID与SocialFi等赛道会长时间处于发展道路中，寻找相关实际应用和价值层次赋能，且随着未来涌入区块链赛道的用户会越来越多，下一个牛市用户数量可能会达到三到五倍的增幅，用户之间的社交属性和凭证需求会随着用户数等比例增长，所以目前早期部署该赛道，其未来潜力也是无法估量的。\n\n# 5. DID 与 SocialFi 发展过程中可能的挑战\n\nDID 赛道 和 SocialFi 目前处于早期探索阶段，有着巨大的发展前景，隐藏着许多仍未被发掘的机会，但同时也有着不少问题等待 Web3 建设者们去挑战：\n\n* 不可转让这一概念本身就存在着技术上的挑战，在限制或防止转移的需求和区块链生态系统之间有着难以跨越的障碍，因为目前来说，几乎所有的项目标准都是围绕着最大可转移性来设计的。\n* 隐私是此类生态系统良好运作的一个重要前提。许多情况下，用户并不希望透露他们所有的身份信息。去中心化的身份信息如何做到仅在必要的时候披露给必要的对象，也是在技术上所面临的一大挑战。\n\n一个只规范资本而不规范人类个人行为的制度可能只会无情地服务于金钱而非人类本身。我们作为 Web3 的参与者和建设者，需要更多的思考和更多的努力来解决这些挑战。而如果我们能够成功解决，则为区块链那些并非只关注金钱的生态系统，打开了一扇通往更为广阔天地的大门。\n\n## 参考资料\n\n1.

Mt's will re-define your social relationship graph. Mt's image tells us that when we started to enter the crypto world, many people are the watchers, they were or surprised, or skeptical, or excited, or afraid. However, as an objective rule, the arrival of anything new alway create chaos, some won, some lost, some waited and waited.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TgeTe7CmlqD3rabUmqF8B.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n### Participation\n\n**Mt's are issued in 12600 pieces.** Every Mt's has its unique characteristics and rarity. Mt's will help you realize your social value, allowing you to gain fun and income from your social connections and behavior. Mt's wants to flip the NFT market with new form of energy. NFT shall not be the chips in the hand of the rich, at least that’s not Mt’s. Mt’s owners help each other in a way that no one has ever done.\n\n**Mt's will issue the first 50 pieces as the seed, half of which will be given as Whitelist to those who have participated and contributed in Mt’s early stages, the other half goes to the first official mint pool where everyone can participate.**\n\nTo obtain the first 50 Mt’s are required to go to Mt’s website, log into personal page for the Invitation Code(IC). ICs are the permission to participate mint. Make sure IC in the pocket prior to each mint round.\n\n**Mt's mint uses an incremental model with an initial price of 0.09 ETH.**\n\n![Totally 6\\*round mint](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nR0342P3yeQvBlOoqlx2s.png?height=1698&width=3396)\n\n## Beyond the PFPs, go ride with mtier!\n\n### Mtier Rank Program\n\nIn order to promote Mt’s influence and build solid relationship among members, Mt’s has its unique incentive program, the Mtier Rank Program(MRP). Once user own Mt’s NFT, he/she becomes a mtier Noob. After completing 2\\*invites and both invitees successful mint Mt’s, mtier Noob go to the rank, the MRP automatically kicks in.\n\nEach mtier has his/her rank(except the Noob), ranks come with different allowances.\nMRP reward is made of two parts: Share reward and Royalties.\nShare reward is an invitation-oriented incentive.\n\n**i.g.**\nMtier1 invites 2\\*mtier2 and both mtier2 sucessfully mint Mt’s NFT, mtier1 will gain 24% share reward from mtier2’s mint costs.  \nIf mtier2 has his/her own 2\\*mtier3 minted Mt’s NFT, mtier2 will gain 24% share reward from mtier3’s mint costs, meanwhile mtier1 gains 12%  share reward from mtier3’s mint costs.\n\nAlso mtiers will gain 10% of the royalties when their Mt’s NFT in Opensea, etc.\nThe specific allowance rate chart shows as following:\n\n![The specific allowance rate chart](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OTy6hxsjyHA5QxGLV_dT8.png?height=1698&width=3396)\n\n### Funds Allocation\n\n**All mint funds will be distributed according to the following rules:**\n50\\.87% will go to Mtier Rank Program.24.13% will be awarded to the CON LAB.\n25% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**Royalty income will be distributed according to the following rules:**\n2\\.49% will be awarded to all users holding NFT and participating in the invitation.\n3% will be awarded to the CON LAB.\n4\\.45% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**The Mt’s Community Treasury:**20% of the Foundation's funds will be used for acquisitions and marketing.80% will be reserved for bonuses.\n\nWhen only 5% of total market Mt's NFT are remained, all bonuses will be shared equally.\n\n### Mt's DAO\n\nAll users holding Mt's NFT are members of Mt's DAO. Mt's DAO members can vote in project decisions and can decide how to use bonuses and whether to acquire new NFTs. Mt's DAO will in future be involved and influence the development of Mt's NFT as the core decision maker of Mt's NFT.\n\n### Reward collection\n\nThe mtier who have activated the rewards, can collect them on Mt’s official website. In order to better motivate new comer, Mt's NFT has been reorganized on the collection mechanism-all Mt's NFT that has collected rewards will be automatically destroyed. This deflation mechanism can increase the value of retained Mt 's NFT. After destruction, designated mtier will receive a new vMt's NFT as a credential to record your existing social network.\n\n### vMt's NFT Function\n\nvMt's NFT is a derivative NFT after the original Mt's NFT is destroyed. 20% of vMt's NFT will be used as the seed for the next project and the rest can be redeemed for future CON LAB new projects. Holding vMt's NFT will also continue to maintain your existing social connections, meaning you will continue to increase the value  your social connections. Further more, Holding vMt's NFT will also give you the opportunity to receive token airdrops.\n\n### Mt's redefines NFT\n\n\"The next era will be defined by today's social networking sites and the depth of connection given to users, and our job is to find the best way for users to share themselves\" - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nThe value of relationships is based on the sharing economy, which means sharing one's state of being, one's information, one's interests, one's hobbies. The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing. Mt’s aims to build a perpetual social-fi  generator in Web3.\n\nThe CON LAB will create a decentralized NFT trading platform driven by influencers and the community through a perpetual network of social connections, with the proceeds of each transaction distributed to the platform's NFT holders to enjoy perpetual dividends and a true return of equity to the user.\n\n## What is Mt's\n\n***The Made-it's , The Miss-it's, The My-turn's!***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ta-DM7lFHd1a24z5Ms0SF.png?height=1600&width=1600)\n\nThis was a great movement that will eventually be remembered in crypto history. Free from the interference of capitals and authorities. There are no losers in this movement.\n\nThis time we are not a bystander, we are expressing our emotions in a way that will influence more crypto practitioners.\n\nFrom this moment on, Mt's will change the world.\n\n### Follow Mt’s NFT\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MtsNFTs)    |    [Disocrd](https://discord.gg/TK3VCgH4pR)    |    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUahYxfJ2xaB9W9js3ifWQ)\n\n## Don't wait&see, up with Mt’s.", "timestamp": 1653379513, "digest": "vyA5575rvQ7kbqkumCcLLXqMptIBWzFhFzwE4MfQexc", "contributor": "0x5b23A5d907805a4dcFBe13aE232442A6746c5C9C"}

Vitalik 等论文摘要\n\n《去中心化社会：找寻 Web3 的灵魂》是 Vitalik 等人联合发表的最新论文，本文讲述了如何通过 “灵魂绑定” Token（本质上来说就是 DID）来建立一个更加多元、丰富的 Desoc（去中心化社会）。论文内容非常长，本文将对这篇论文的重要观点进行转述与总结，这样读者很快就能了解去中心化社会有关知识了。\n\n### 1.1 Web3成立之初的局限性\n\n在不到十年的时间里，Web3 创造了一个庞大的金融帝国，这一成就令世界瞩目，连 facebook 都以 all in 的形式参与到这场金融盛宴之中。加密和经济领域的基础元素，为金融交易带来了一个丰富、开放且多元的生态系统。但是这个过程中出现了一个矛盾，金融交易的经济价值是由人们现实生活中的社会关系等决定的，也就是说它的内部运转逻辑并不完善甚至可以说并不完整。正是由于 Web3 缺乏代表社会身份的基础元素，它从根本上依赖于它所要超越的中心化的 Web2 结构，这具有非常大的局限性。\n\n这种依赖性在具体应用方面也有很明显的体现：\n\n* 虽然 NFT 通过 Opensea 等去中心化平台进行交易，但是许多 NFT 艺术家会通过 Twitter 等中心化平台进行宣传，以向人们证明其真实性并达到推广的目的\n* 各种去中心化项目经常依赖 Web2 基础设施来实施投票\n* 许多 Web3 参与者依赖 Coinbase 或 Binance 等中心化实体管理的托管钱包\n\n此外由于缺乏原生的 Web3 身份，今天的 DeFi 生态系统无法支持实体经济中普遍存在的活动，如等额抵押贷款甚至超低额抵押贷款（目前加密贷款平台一般只支持超额抵押）或者签订公寓租赁等合同。在此我们试图通过“灵魂绑定”的 Token（“soulbound” tokens，SBTs，也就是 DID 去中心化身份）来打破这些局限。除此以外通过 Web3 社会身份，还可以就财富集中和金融攻击的治理脆弱性等更广泛的长期问题上取得巨大进展，同时刺激 web3 的政治、经济和社会应用的大幅发展。我们把这些用例和它们所促成的更丰富的多元生态系统称为“去中心化社会”（DeSoc）。**本文第二部分会就 web2 的社交与 Desoc 进行对比进一步展示出 Desoc 的一些特点与优势。**\n\n### 1.2 Desoc 的要素与畅想\n\n首先我们应先了解一下 DeSoc 的基本元素，它（“灵魂绑定” Token, SBTs） 围绕着人们持有的不可转让的账户（或钱包），代表着承诺、证书和关系，这种 Token 就像一份扩展的简历。可以简单地把这种东西理解为我们的身份证，有了身份证我们就可以缴纳社保、绑定银行卡等。没有身份证或者说法律认可的身份这些都很难实现，而目前的 web3 就处在这种没有身份证明的困局当中。在这里把起身份证明的东西被称为“灵魂”， 将账户持有的 Token 称为“灵魂 Token”（SBTs）。\n\n想象一下这样一个世界，大多数参与者都有“灵魂 Token”，它对应一系列的关系、会员资格和证书。因此人们不用公开自己的真实身份，就可以让他人看到自己的教育证书，就业历史，或自己的著作或艺术作品的一串哈希值，这种 Token 对相关信息的公开类似于人们在简历中分享关于自己的信息。更重要的是，通过这种身份人们可以互相识别，甚至可以实现目前无法达到的等额抵押、合同签订等。人们甚至可以无纸化，因为数据可以记录一切，并且因为它不可篡改的特点，又让一切变得更加可信。在这些技术的支持下 web3 一定会越来越丰富且美好。\n\n### 1.3 相关实例\n\n**艺术与“灵魂”**\n\n艺术家可以通过“灵魂”将作品与自己连接。当发行可交易的 NFT 时，艺术家可以从他们的“灵魂”中发行 NFT。艺术家的“灵魂”携带的 SBTs 越多，买家就越容易识别出“灵魂”是属于该艺术家的，从而也就能确定 NFT 的真实性。艺术家可以更进一步，在他们的“灵魂”中发布一个链接的 SBTs，证明某个 NFT 是该“系列藏品”的成员。因此，“灵魂”将创造一种可靠的、链上的交易和识别方式。 很明显，它的现实应用还有很多，NFT 艺术家的例子只是其中最具有代表性的。实际上，除了 web3 领域外，它也能有解决一些现实问题，比如知识产权、司法文件真伪判断等。毕竟随着深度造假技术的进步，人类和算法的直接检查将越来越无法检测真实性。虽然区块链的加入使我们能够追踪特定作品的制作时间，但 SBTs 将使我们能够追踪相关内容的社会出处，为我们提供丰富的社会背景，让我们了解发布作品的人的“灵魂”——他们的会员资格、关系、证书的组合。通过这种方式“高仿”可以很容易地被识别出来。\n\n**“灵魂”空投**\n\n在具体说明“灵魂”空投之前我们需要明白空投是什么，以及空投的意义到底是什么？区块链领域的空投是一种将数字货币通过区块链技术大规模分发到一些已有的数字货币钱包上的行为，比如以太币、比特币、EOS.IO 钱包。简单来说就是向广大网友“发钱”的过程。\n\n当面对空投人们会有四种行为：（1）上网搜索相关内容（2）和朋友聊相关内容，使朋友知晓有关信息（3）之前或者之后疯狂注册账号，以获得空投（4）直接无视\n\n空投本身是一种非常流行的营销策略，并不是所谓的“慈善”，因此在上述几种情况中，（3）和（4）属于无效空投，并不能带来实际的收益或者说宣传的效果。而其中的第三条属于危害性最大的一条，也就是常说的女巫攻击。为了避免第三条项目方往往设立许多空投限制，但是很明显并不能完全避免。通过 DID 可以有效解决上述问题，因为项目方可以依据 DID 进行空投，可以有效提高投放的精准性和准确性。\n\n论文中的相关例子还有很多这里就不多做列举了，如果感兴趣可以点击[论文原文](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763)进行细致了解。\n\n很显然，上文那两个所谓的相关实例都还是比较理想化的概念。**本文将于第三部分举出一些现有的比较具有代表性的相关去中心化项目，各位读者可以通过这些例子对相关内容予以把握。同时会在第四部分就上文提到的 DID 的使用、价值和发展前景进行详细的说明。**\n\n### 1.4 结论\n\n通过这篇文章大家可以预见到 Desoc 的美好未来，但同时也需要意识到 DID 只是这一远大历程中的一小步。此外，上面描述的场景只是 DeSoc 对现有项目与应用的强化作用，但是并没有涉及对比如物理、政治、社会以及它们与现实世界的复杂关系的描述，而它们实际上占据了我们现实生活的很大比例。所有这些都表明，上面描绘的远大理想，可能只是 DeSoc 最终形态的“雏形”。**论文中就 SBTs 的威胁与挑战也进行了比较细致的描述，在本文的第五部分将结合现实情况进行细致描写这里就不再细说。**\n\n# 2.  新型社交为何悄然而至\n\n### 2.1 Web2.0 传统社交弊病\n\nWeb2.0本质是平台经济，是以一小撮为代表的垄断性寡头构架，互联网在该阶段变成全民级别应用，聚集了社交、搜索、电商等超级生态应用开发，且每个行业领域龙头公司几乎垄断行业资源和发展上限，这使得Web2公司在拥有最终解释权的情况下去剥削和占有用户资源信息时游刃有余，例如微信和QQ在中国产生的影响力和不可置换性，使得用户无法维护本身利益，用户在Web2.0中更像是平台的附庸而不是服务接收者。而Web3.0是属于Token经济的后端程序革命，其本意是在为非平台内部的生态参与者获取更多的话语权和创造权，并拥有产品本身的价值支配权利，以及隐私性和安全性。一定程度的避免了不平衡的垄断机制。\n\n### 2.2 SocialFi 是 Web3.0 的必要组件\n\nSocialFi的出现是对抗传统社交平台弊端的必要产物，Web2.0 时代的社交平台被各大运营巨头控制，从用户数据中获取商业价值，忽略用户的感受。SocialFi基于区块链技术，用户身份信息的匿名性有助于保护隐私和安全，更有利于解决用户数据的确认问题以及权利下放。\n\n相信随着用户对于隐私以及自由的追求，越来越多的人会投身于Web3.0的世界，在用户渴望加密技术带给的数据主权时也渴望获得自己在这个世界独特的身份和地位。在Web2.0-3.0过渡的过程中，互联网用户需要一些中间件来从简单迁移到复杂，从而从原始空间迁移到元空间。元空间的实现需要从现有的互联网世界出发，利用一系列的Web3.0组件，分批分阶段的迎接新的用户。在尝试了Defi的去中心化资产流、NFT的数字工作价值、发现Gamefi的P2E之后，去中心化的意见发布和个人展示已经下一个需要探索和开发的Web3.0组件，在互联网发展历史中可以发现社交化可以说是网民的刚性需求。\n\n### 2.3 线上数据分析\n\n根据[Zippa](https://www.zippia.com/advice/cryptocurrency-statistics/)的统计以及交易平台和钱包的来源，2018-2020 年全球加密货币用户群增加了近 190%，2021 年进一步加速。 数据的增加可能是由于账户数量的增加以及身份识别的改进，以及在 2021 年特斯拉和万事达卡等公司宣布进军加密货世界等从热度上升带来的用户数量造成的。下图展示了Web3.0近几年来的趋势变化：         \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jov7Glf5pfabWlpkN1DD0.png?height=482&width=1141)\n\n根据Google Search数据统计，如今的互联网 2.0 使用用户约在 49.5 亿人左右，对标3亿的加密用户都还只是冰山一角。绝大多数的互联网用户都害困在传统社交网络中，让加密应用的热度扩散才是Web 3.0 走向主流用户的最关键一步。\n\n# 3. 理念的实际运用\n\n### 3.1 ENS\n\nENS”，全称 Ethereum Name Service， 是一个基于以太坊区块链的分布式，开放，可扩展的命名系统。简单来说，通过它可以把原本难以记忆的以太坊地址变成自定义的短地址。通过这种方式，人们可以轻易记下有关内容，既可以减少工作的繁琐程度，也可以减少不必要的风险。同时让用户可以通过以太坊账户和 ENS 配置文件控制自己的数字身份，不再依赖于传统的“中介”。\n\n**技术**\n\n这往往是在注册中心和解析器实现的：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KxP_2muLbCWAntIOITBtl.png?height=458&width=486)\n\nENS注册中心由一个智能合约组成，该合约维护所有域和子域的列表，并存储所有域和子域的三个关键信息：\n\n* 域的所有者\n* 域的解析器\n* 域下所有记录的缓存时间\n\nENS 注册中心作用很简单，只是为了从名称映射到负责它的解析器。解析器负责将名称转换为地址。任何有相关功能的合约都可以作为ENS中的解析器。\n\n在ENS中解析名称有两个步骤：首先，询问注册中心是哪个解析器负责该名称，其次，请该解析器回答查询。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/duhbK48dgxF77doKkPN3t.png?height=254&width=467)\n\n比如，我们试图找到\"foo. eth\"指向的以太坊地址。首先，我们询问注册中心哪个解析器负责“foo. eth”。然后，我们向解析器查询“foo. eth\"的地址。\n\n**数据**（截止至2022-05-23）\n\nDiscord关注：4万+\n\nTwitter关注：18.3万\n\n数据显示，以太坊域名服务商 ENS 在 5 月份以来的收入已经达到了 802 万美元，创下今年以来的新高。今年以来 ENS 已经累计获得了 4864 万美元的收入。\n\n**小结**\n\n通过运作流程可以看出来，整个过程并不会侵害用户的隐私，但是又为加密交易和地址记忆提供了便利条件。V神曾评论说：“ENS是迄今为止最成功的非金融类以太坊应用程序，基本可以类比为一个去中心化的电话册”。很明显它是前文所提到的 Desoc 的一个现实应用和技术支撑，随着行业的发展具有非常巨大的发展潜力。\n\n### 3.2 Bright ID\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wuZhsWQvRKNVOjwoLfTC_.png?height=609&width=1920)\n\nBrightID 是 Web3.0 用户的身份系统，基于以太坊开发，它是完全独立于传统和互联网身份认证的系统。一般用于DAPP用户验证；活动验证；信誉构建等。\n\n具有以下特点：\n\n无门槛：任何人都有权利拥有 Bright ID。\n\n隐私性：Bright ID 不会向用户索取或捕获任何个人隐私信息。\n\n开源：公共产品，完全免费且开源。\n\n**运作和验证方式**\n\nBrightID需要经过人脸和多人认证的方式来通过审核。认证结合链下会议视频等非隐私信息渠道的方式，采用视频会议的形式，由以上六位验证官负责主持验证会议并进行验证工作。验证会议的具体时间日历可在 BrightID 官网查看。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gp05mZ9Gx-tgYSiH2uGga.png?height=354&width=1280)\n\n**相关数据**\n\n融资信息\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BmJ3Z3sIoWc7xg5mA4WAk.png?height=70&width=514)\n\nMetaCartel 是一个由软件工程师、创业者以及以太坊爱好者构建的去中心化社区。他们在全球拥有600多名成员，他们具有丰富的领域经验和专业技能。已经为很多此领域最受欢迎的新兴项目提供了早期资金：Mintbase；Known Origin；Kickback；RocketNFT；Gelato Finance等。\n\n数据分析(截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注：13.2K\n\nAPP 融合：13款\n\nBright ID 用户：57K+\n\n**合作方：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySb7HH2E3tUyY-Zz9BFgX.png?height=471&width=1323)\n\n**小结**\nBrightID 在Web3.0时代扮演着很重要的角色，DAPP&APP、活动组织都采用 BrightID 进行身份验证。但这仅仅是 BrightID 潜力的一小部分，随着 BrightID 产品的迭代，以及其构建的信任网络不断扩大，将成就 BrightID 无限的可能性。\n\n### 3.3 MetaMask\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0n_GpHSQzK8HF-UjI7TT-.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nMetaMask，又或是人们口中常说的“小狐狸”钱包，日益成为加密圈内不可或缺的工具，你的钱包地址在一定程度上，可以代表你个人在链上的身份。\n\nMetaMask是一个通过web2互联网浏览器就能访问，且以低门槛与以太坊网络进行交互的工具钱包。它是Consensys目前面对终端用户的唯一产品，是以太坊最早的钱包之一，也是目前用户量最大的钱包。始于2015年，长期以网页端、免费、“半官方”的形态为大众所熟知，属于非托管型钱包。随着2020年Defi应用热潮与2021年NFT的火爆市场效应，MetaMask的用户量极速增长。2020年新增手机客户端和交易功能（名为Swap）。2021年5月推出MetaMask机构版，让机构用户能将MetaMask与机构级托管结合、方便工作流管理、易于汇报等。\n\n但起初，MetaMask其实并不是作为钱包插件之类的消费者项目，而是希望成为一种开发工具。Metamask母公司，是以太坊联合创始人Joseph Lubin所创办的区块链巨头公司之一的ConsenSys。ConsenSys 是以太坊重点项目的企业孵化器，旗下的MetaMask是ConsenSys布局的六大业务板块基础设施板块的重点项目。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YnjEZyE-akF8hkOslm1UO.png?height=188&width=839)\n\n**技术**\n\n现MetaMask已兼容绝大部分的区块链网络Dapp（包括Ethereum、Binance、Polygon），可集成托管解决方案来管理秘钥存储和多重签名批准。团队也在逐步优化产品本身，简化交易流程、减少交易费用、签字程序等。并逐步提升其合规能力，让钱包内可以进行高风险评估，安全进行去中心化和匿名交易等。\n对于大量的用户选择MetaMask作为迈入Web3的第一步，团队除了打磨好产品，提升钱包本身的安全性能，用户友好度之外。面对发展迅猛的加密货币行业，使用需求量的暴增与跨网络的需求都是不可忽视的问题。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pzMu5CxfcUo_ekJI1Ma9l.png?height=419&width=1445)\n\n**相关数据（截止到2022-05-23）**\n\n**Twitter关注**：75.4 K\n\n**融资情况**：2022-03-16，ConsenSys 完成4.5亿美元D轮融资，完成最新一轮融资后，ConsenSys的估值超过70亿美元，比2021年11月完成2亿美元C 轮融资时的估值增加一倍以上。ConsenSys首席执行官Joe Lubin在接受Decrypt采访时表示，MetaMask很快将推出DAO并发行代币。新的DAO并不会参与管理MetaMask，但将为MetaMask的更新提供资金。可见，MetaMask的资金储备是比较充足的。\n\n**其他数据**：\n\n根据公开数据，截止目前，MetaMask的月活跃用户已达到3000万。而巅峰时期的以太坊全网活跃地址也才只有 800 万左右。不难看出，Meta钱包的月活跃数量远超于此，也印证了MetaMask钱包现在已经成为了大量加密的首选。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZijDJTKGeNWtZC7Higmnt.png?height=804&width=1526)\n\n截止到2022年3月份，MetaMask插件的下载了超过1,000,000，目前日活跃用户大概在6k-8k左右，每日新用户超过2K+。目前加密货币钱包类用户早已超过8000万，对于一些出现的维护问题，团队已出现了棘手的情况。\n\n相较于互联网46亿的活跃用户来说，加密货币未来的将拥有更广阔的市场。目前MetaMask主要支持以太坊和各种EVM链，未来若想跨接到Solana等多生态，团队将如何开拓和维系其服务，值得期待。\n\n**小结**\n\n如今，MetaMask的使用已相当普及，这似乎已成为了进入Web3的第一步——生成你的去中心化钱包地址。而钱包也逐渐成为区块链世界中的一种身份象征，作为用户使用频率最高的小狐狸钱包，swap与NFT购买，是其最常用的两个功能。也因为以太坊生态中任何一个应用，都会支持MetaMask，两者的发展相辅相成，逐渐将钱包地址与Web3世界里去中心化个人身份的划上等号。\n未来，伴随着多链时代的到来，通用钱包的概念或将被逐渐被弱化，取而代之的可能是针对性更强的点对点产品服务，如专门的NFT钱包，打金钱包等。随着时间的推移，MetaMask自身以及新生代的钱包的发展都同样值得期待\n\n### 3.4 CyberConnect \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eXmS6-XLpYtKe3eZn9mQm.png?height=77&width=346)\n\nCyberconnect旨在解决社交图表（Social Graph）再分配问题，这个问题其实很好去解释，就是说Web2.0中各种平台的信息无法互通，造成重复资源浪费且难以找到各种志同道合的用户，社交图谱相对单一。\n\n而Cyberconnect所表明的内涵或者本质也很简单（用户之间的关系不仅仅是双向或者三向的，更是各种交叉和重叠的混合网络关系）例如A本身，与A关注的用户，和关注A的用户进行不同连线组合，形成一张独特的“图谱”，证明该用户的社交关系网，而从这些与用户A有联系的人又重新编织，又将形成新的图谱。这样网络世界中拥有相同的兴趣爱好的用户，同游戏玩家，商品贸易中的的买家卖家等通过社交图谱逐渐变得清晰。**如此一来，CyberConnect 便打破了不同平台之间的壁垒。**\n\n**技术**\n\n关于数据和存储：CyberConnect社交图数据存储时使用的IPFS和无许可协议Ceramic构建，联通Ceramic区块链锚定和自定义数据固定服务，可以保证CyberConnect链上数据长期存储。（使用Ceramic DID方法）关于用户数据在不同的平台如何集成，则需要采用Ceramic身份协议IDX，它为开发人员提供一个统一的界面，在CyberConnect内部查询这些数据分析，反过来CyberConnect也会给与DID链上系统提供更多的身份数据。\n\n与其它项目集成：同时CyberConnect还会与其它Web3项目集成获取信息，例如NFT平台Foundation与Rarible等，其实最重要的一点是让玩家通过一个统一的身份来参与不同种类的生态应用，同时也能与Web2链接使链上和链下数据结合起来成为更强大的去中心化数据提供商。\n\n**相关数据：**(数据截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注数：57,7k+\n\n生态项目数：30+\n\n入驻用户：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a7o2JaOaNfPgndwT2sSm3.png?height=108&width=679)\n\n融资消息：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MKRShXhLUbStaV7wGpQdV.png?height=127&width=685)\n\n其中的Multicoin曾投资过Near Protocol、Solana、Helium、Duna Analytics、Audius等潜力新兴区块链或者具有足够实际应用的优质Web3.0应用，此次Cyberconnect也正是该机构看好未来web3社交领域的潜力而开展的首次社交应用投资，证明该赛道的早期成长属性和该项目未来价值发掘。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgkZfhUF3wFkZo_i2RlCP.png?height=542&width=1145)\n\n**小结**\n\n社交化图标也是DID最核心应用场景之一。毕竟身份的重要程度随着社交功能完善等比例增长。虽然目前Cyberconnect已经接入Solana、Ethereum、Binance网络链，在用户体验感上来说，以太坊网络链是功能较完善且操作流畅，但部分操作功能在Solana上还处于开发阶段，不仅容易在网络上造成拥堵而且需要使用不同的钱包插件，使得用户体验感下降。\n\n作为一个去中心化的社交图谱协议，为Web3.0社会网络和元宇宙服务，CyberConnect还需要在前进的道路上完成更多的目标。\n\n### 3.5 Mirror\n\n提到去中心化的写作平台，大部分区块链用户都会脱口而出“Mirror”，其平台在成立不到一年就被联合广场风险投资公司估值1亿美元，获1千万美元投资。作为去中心化的写作平台赛道代表——Mirror 是依靠哪些去中心化特性和功能”荣登“宝座呢？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jylJj2d9u5m_YMYfOnvQA.png?height=601&width=865)\n\n**功能简介**\n\nMirror 跟中心化的写作平台最大的不同是，他具备加密区块链产品的特性和功能。参与用户无需通过邮箱账号，手机号码，社交帐户等中心化的身份验证手段来注册账号，只需要绑定自己的0x开头的钱包地址即可生成独一无二的“作者专栏”，类似于上文所提及的ENS（以太坊域名）。对于部分创作者来说，跟外界的接触仅仅由一串小小的字符连接，完美的融合了去中心化身份的理念。\n\n除此之外，创作者可以在Mirror平台上发布文章/创作图片等作品，每一件公开发布的作品不是保存在中心化服务器上，而是透过区块链存储专案Arweave进行链上的数据保存，经用户进行加密签名后生成一段哈希值记录，将作品永久的保存在区块链上。Mirror上更是支持创作者将自己的作品铸造成NFT，让原先没有边际成本、可被无限复制的内容作品具有稀缺性，从而被赋予价值。不仅无法被他人复制或修改，而且可以在各大NFT市场上进行售卖。\n\n其次，Mirror 也提供读者募资功能，读者喜欢的文章可以直接使用加密货币”打赏“创作者；共同的创作者可以按照设定好的盈利比例来获取各自部分的收益；以及其平台上的作品拍卖功能等等。\n\n**技术**\n\nMirror 在保存用户文章时使用的两类 Web3 组件，一个是用于对文章进行永久存储的 Arweave，另一个是用于对文章进行确权与交易的 NFT 铸造平台以太坊主网。\n\n1. Mirror 的存储组件-Arweave，是一条针对存储进行了底层性能优化的公链，因此用户在 Arweave 链上存储数据的成本相较其他智能合约公链平台有极大的降低。同时，链上存储的特征保证了在 Arweave 之上存储数据的永久性，因此，基于 Arweave 的存储模式也常被归类为永久存储。创作者在保存文章修改的时候，Mirror 会在后台自动对新的文章进行二次上链存储。\n2. Mirror 的确权组件，在存储的同时，通常会需要另一组 Web3 组件，以便对存储的内容进行确权，也就是将内容铸造为 NFT 格式的资产。但此步骤是在以太坊网络上以 NFT 的形式进行确权，成本由创作者自行承担支付。\n\n**相关数据（截至2022-05-23）**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sjq8tIDcdQka6SZ6w-cY3.png?height=71&width=699)\n\n**小结**\n\n去中心化创作平台-Mirror 的核心创新点很多，打破了传统创作平台的束缚，将NFT，社区DAO，Write-Fi相结合的经济模型，解决了部分去中心化平台所追求的“通过创作内容实现价值变现”的难题，相信 Mirror 这样肩负着去中心化任务的创作平台也会在迈向 WEB3.0 的道路上越走越远。\n\n### 3.6 Project Galaxy\n\nProject Galaxy 的愿景是想要打造一个最大的 Web3 数据凭证（credential data）网络，建造一个开放协作数据聚合基础设施，助力开发者和项目方建造更好的产品和社区。项目方在 Project Galaxy 平台上面为用户创建并奖励 NFT，用户完成项目方的任务，比如在链上进行特定的交互、参加会议、关注推特、加入 Discord 社区、提交问卷、参与测试等方式获得NFT。\n\n**技术：**\n\nProject Galaxy 目前支持两种方式来提供数据凭证 GraphQL 和 REST API。Galaxy上有两个角色，分别是数据贡献者和使用者。数据贡献者可以用子图查询或静态快照（subgraph queries or static snapshots）的方式贡献链上数据，同时在链下，Galaxy 也集成了信息来源，比如推特和 GitHub。\n\n数据使用者使用 Application module, Credential Oracle Engine, and Credential API 三种方式使用数据。并使用 Galaxy 的代币 $GAL 支付，因此数据贡献者可以获得激励。\n\n**相关数据**：\n\n已入驻项目方：400+\n\nGalaxy ID 用户：170 万+\n\nTwitter关注：30 万+\n\n融资情况：2021 年 5 月种子轮融资，2022年1月由 Multicoin Capital 和 Dragonfly Capital 领投、多个机构参投的 1000 万美元融资。随后 2 月在 CoinList 平台公募获得 1500 万美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gZN7tj9iV2lHWkssLK7Z3.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nProject Galaxy上线时间为2021年5月，运行不到一年，活跃用户量远大于同类型的项目 POAP 和 Rabbithole 。2021 年底银河女孩系列 NFT 活动让 Project Galaxy 一举成名，银河女孩 NFT 持有者更是获得了该项目原生代币 $GAL 在 CoinList 平台上公募的优先队列名额。后续 Meta Cowboy，Dr.SOL 等系列 NFT 持有者也获得了 $GAL 空投。\n\n**小结**\n\nProject Galaxy 无疑是一个非常成功的项目。链上身份凭证和数字身份一直都有市场需求，Project Galaxy 作为多链项目满足了市场在这方面的需求，为整个加密生态系统提供服务。在经历 Defi Summer 和 NFT Summer 之后 ，它抓住了 Crypto 项目方频繁使用 NFT 作为用户激励工具的需求。它给项目方提供了发放 NFT 奖励活动的工具和用户流量资源，初步形成了项目方和项目方之间，项目方和用户之间，用户和用户之间的多重网络效应。\n\n# 4. 新型社交的展望\n\n### 最初的载体与未来场景？\n\n绝大部分用户最熟悉DID理念实际运用应该是区块链钱包，例如Metamask是作为用户接入整个区块链的入口端，具有隐私性、安全性、不可追踪性。这是DID赛道最初应用成果，但是其缺点也很明确。钱包地址的注册缺少独特性，一个人可以注册大量毫无价值的钱包。其次大钱包只能显示代币难以展示NFT和参与证明等未来势必流行的资产，更不用说SBT所畅享的“无纸化”证明，这是钱包的局限性。第三钱包无法配置资产可编程属性，无法限制其他人查看钱包资产，从而导致黑客攻击情况发生。不过理念的实践是处于不断完善的过程。现在已经出现了可以展示NFT和参与证明（POA）的去中心化身份应用，还有隐私赛道对于钱包和其它DID应用进行代币隐私化、资产可视化等功能赋能等，预计不短时间内所有区块链赛道应用可以进行用户DID绑定，可记录用户等额抵押、合同签订、参与证明和哈希参数等不可篡改的数据，潜在提升单一用户DID价值\n\n从结构和理论上来阐述，有社交的地方更加注重身份特征，所以从根本属性上来说SocialFi就是实现该理念的最初赛道，只有用户们尝试并参与进来，才能够从本质上理解DID在区块链各赛道中重要程度，在未来去中心化社交领域当中，寻找相同理念思想的用户从而构建和谐关系，通过新兴匹配技术进行身份特征快速转移和整合，快速的梳理出用户兴趣爱好与社交圈，可以大程度的减少网络中诈骗行为，提高社交沟通交流效率。\n\n### 如何评估用户DID价值赋能？\n\n未来DID账号的价值根据其内部的资产总数和分配比例，如加密货币、NFT、参与证明等进行价值评估，以及个人身份信息验证，与其他用户之间互动，评论留言等进行附加属性评估。最后就是项目之间的筛选机制和会员资格评判，如拥有某些NFT或者证明的用户获得相应空投奖励、参与测试的资格等，这些都进一步的丰富了DID整体价值属性。\n\n对于目前市场来说，DID基础设施赛道仍未出现热点项目能引领该赛道的热潮，例如DeFi的火热是Uniswap带领的，GameFi的出圈前者与Axie有关，后者StepN再次引领，所以扩大潜在用户群体还需要落实到实际具体项目当中，单一可行的理念是无法吸引到足够的投资者的。\n\nDID赛道本身是没有主动生产价值的能力，创建了钱包地址不代表钱包有钱，但是从另一角度来说DID也是最能兼容区块链中所有领域的基础设施，其价值决定极大程度上基于与其它项目应用的兼容，毕竟DID属于后端程序，与个性化应用并不冲突。\n\n### 趋势预测\n\n在如今整体环境影响下，以NFT和GameFi赛道为首的炒作属性偏高的赛道整体估值下降较多，新用户和资金参与量明显下跌，而以Web 3.0等基础设施属性较强的底层架构融资情况增长。可以明确的是DID与SocialFi等赛道会长时间处于发展道路中，寻找相关实际应用和价值层次赋能，且随着未来涌入区块链赛道的用户会越来越多，下一个牛市用户数量可能会达到三到五倍的增幅，用户之间的社交属性和凭证需求会随着用户数等比例增长，所以目前早期部署该赛道，其未来潜力也是无法估量的。\n\n# 5. DID 与 SocialFi 发展过程中可能的挑战\n\nDID 赛道 和 SocialFi 目前处于早期探索阶段，有着巨大的发展前景，隐藏着许多仍未被发掘的机会，但同时也有着不少问题等待 Web3 建设者们去挑战：\n\n* 不可转让这一概念本身就存在着技术上的挑战，在限制或防止转移的需求和区块链生态系统之间有着难以跨越的障碍，因为目前来说，几乎所有的项目标准都是围绕着最大可转移性来设计的。\n* 隐私是此类生态系统良好运作的一个重要前提。许多情况下，用户并不希望透露他们所有的身份信息。去中心化的身份信息如何做到仅在必要的时候披露给必要的对象，也是在技术上所面临的一大挑战。\n\n一个只规范资本而不规范人类个人行为的制度可能只会无情地服务于金钱而非人类本身。我们作为 Web3 的参与者和建设者，需要更多的思考和更多的努力来解决这些挑战。而如果我们能够成功解决，则为区块链那些并非只关注金钱的生态系统，打开了一扇通往更为广阔天地的大门。\n\n## 参考资料\n\n1.

Overuse of chemicals in the manufacturing process, the use of uncertified chemicals and mechanisms for preservation and maturing processes are main issues affecting the quality of agricultural goods as well as the overall health of consumers. Consequently, consumers increasingly want healthier foods with simple ingredients and certified organic status. However, the organic food industry is facing an existential crisis. Consumers are worried that the food they are eating is truly organic.\n\nOver the years, there have been several fraud cases of organic food where non-organic products tricked consumers by misleading them under a particular label, imported ingredients, or privately making financial arrangements. While several certifying bodies certify a farm for producing organic products, it does not assure that a particular food product is 100 per cent organic (Verified Organic, 2020). The growing skepticism is stagnating consumer confidence worldwide, but **what if the entire food chain could be placed on a “trust-less” platform where transactions are transparent, traceable, tamper-evident, immutable and compliant?**\n\nMechanisms to classify agricultural products’ quality are highly requested due to the lack of accountability in the current supply-chain process. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that offers the much-required traceability and transparency in an otherwise complex food supply chain by preventing fraudulence and ensuring the authenticity of products to consumers. Besides capturing data at every point within the supply chain ecosystem, a cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) powered Blockchain system also ensures that it’s shared amongst every supply chain participant, including farmer, manufacturer, supplier, distributor, and consumer (Sofocle Technologies, 2020). For stakeholders in the food supply chain, having traceability and transparency will build better relationships with their customers, increases efficiency, and reduces the risk and cost of food recalls, fraud, and product loss (Bumblauskas, Mann, Dugan & Rittmer, 2020).\n\n## **Outbreaks**\n\nFurthermore, considering the current Covid-19 pandemic scenario, traceability along the supply chain is vital. When an outbreak of food tampering or disease occurs, it can take days, if not weeks, to find its source. For instance, in 2018, at least 18 reported outbreaks of foodborne illnesses in the USA, including the E. coli found in romaine lettuce. If investigators cannot point to a specific farm or farms, the government usually advises consumers to avoid products grown in a particular area (as in the case of romaine lettuce from Yuma, Arizona), or even avoid the good altogether. According to Walmart, millions of bags or heads of lettuce had to be removed, and consumers lost confidence in romaine lettuce entirely (Walmart, 2018). Better traceability could help save lives by allowing companies to act faster and protect farmers’ livelihoods by only discarding produce from the affected farms.\n\nToday, major corporations such as Walmart, Starbucks, and Nestlé are executing blockchain programs. For example, to validate the framework, Walmart, along with its technology partner IBM, ran two proof of concept projects. One initiative was to trace mangos sold in Walmart’s US stores and the other was to trace pork sold in its Chinese stores. The blockchain-based food traceability system worked. It allowed the upload of certificates of authenticity to the blockchain for pork in China, adding more trust and confidence to a system where it used to be a severe problem, and for mangoes in the US, the time needed to trace their provenance went from 7 days to 2.2 seconds (Hyperledger, 2019).\n\n## Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) making it accessible.\n\nWith big players announcing blockchain programs, it is easy to assume this technology requires massive capital expenditures. Nevertheless, blockchain technologies have risen exponentially over the last years and are now available through numerous Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) delivery models. This means, there is no expensive infrastructure to purchase or upgrade as Walmart did back in 2018. BaaS platforms only require a device with an internet browser and easily integrate with existing supply chain management systems. With little deployment time or expense needed, these subscription-based, out-of-the-box systems are ready to launch. An outstanding example of Blockchain BaaS success is Ruby Rockets’ frozen snack brand’s work in its supply chain. The company is committed to using only organic or natural fruits and vegetables in its nutritious snack foods. Ruby Rockets implemented a BaaS solution to support this commitment, integrating the platform with its existing accounting system, purchase orders, inventory management system, and online shop. In fewer than 90 days, Ruby Rockets had a system to track products upstream and downstream. Now, the company can rapidly trace ingredient origins and log processing information, ensuring product integrity backed by data on the distributed ledger, ensuring a “USDA-Certified 100-Percent Organic” label (Pratik, 2020)\n\n## Verdict\n\nIt is clear that the long-term benefits and opportunities in applying blockchain technologies to business operations are undeniable. Opening a traceable, transparent supply chain to shoppers is an effective way of building consumer trust and may help the brand stand out against competition at the point of sale. A commitment of this innovative nature would improve operational efficiency, increase revenue, and position a brand image with high corporate social responsibility. Indeed, as blockchain technology adoption rises among farmers, suppliers, and food manufacturers, the organic food supply chain will only strengthen, which means healthier food and beverages for consumers today and a sustainable future for tomorrow.\n\n**References:**\n\nDaniel Bumblauskas, Arti Mann, Brett Dugan & Jacy Rittmer.

{"id": "Sj99zfmZBhQ_9xl5UuoicfcSNFDgU7pb04_LdYWtlOU", "title": "Why Dark Forest Matters: A Good Game, not a Crypto Game", "body": "[Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/) is a massively multiplayer (MMO) real-time strategy (RTS) game in closed beta. If you like strategy games, you should play it. Anyone who is a fan of games like Sins of a Solar Empire, Factorio, or Civilization should *definitely* play it. It’s not a game with global appeal like Super Mario Odyssey, but it doesn’t need to be nor try to be.\n\nPersonally, it's the best new game I’ve played in 2022. When I got off the waitlist I played it for 10 hours straight -- that’s why I’m writing this post. It’s the most exciting strategy game I’ve played since StarCraft 2. It’s the most exciting competitive multiplayer game I’ve played since Valorant. And it’s renewed my optimism for the potential of web3 games. Why? It gets many things right, but it gets a few things very, very right:\n\n* It is a refreshing take on a stale genre\n* It has a competitive ladder with a fresh take on ranking\n* It’s plugin system & open source codebase brings modding back to games\n* It shakes up assumptions around the infrastructure costs of online multiplayer games\n* It has a thoughtful team that closely engages with the community\n\nIntrigued? Great, read on! But there is one minor detail you might care to know… Dark Forest runs on “The Blockchain”.\n\n### Blockchains, Monetization, and Games\n\nBlockchains and cryptocurrencies are a divisive topic in recent times, but especially so in the gaming community. Initial promises of a cross-platform utopia with transferable skins and items quickly gave way to a wave of “crypto games” with [terrible monetization schemes](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/08/axie-infinity-reduces-slp-emissions-to-prevent-collapse/) and [high profile hacks](https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolf-game-highlights-challenges-of-nft-game-development). These, along with other narratives around the most popular blockchains using energy-guzzling Proof of Work algorithms and NFTs destroying the environment, have poisoned the well for any game touting blockchain-adjacent features.\n\nThe negative reaction from the gaming community to companies adding blockchain features, like [Discord teasing an Ethereum integration](https://cointelegraph.com/news/discord-community-splits-as-ceo-unveils-pre-released-ethereum-integration), makes sense! The cut runs deeper and older than crypto gaming’s recent spotlight – it triggers all-too-fresh memories of the gaming industry's parlous relationship with new types of monetization. The sting of in-game ads, base game content behind paid DLC, and hellish microtransaction models is still felt in the community. And while some developers, like [the SW: Battlefront 2 devs, had a change of heart](https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/star-wars-battlefront-ii-microtransactions-removed-after-fan-boycott-a3693736.html), it’s been a rocky journey. [Misguided attempts to win over players](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/) notwithstanding, the community still finds itself with games like [The Sims 4](https://gamerant.com/the-sims-4-kits-microtransactions-price-why/) offering $800 of paid DLC.\n\n![This legendary comment by an EA community team member is the most downvoted comment in the history of Reddit.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lhUJ5IJZCc9DTbi0UnYK6.png?height=190&width=1432)\n\nThe good news is that Dark Forest is not trying to sell you anything, nor is it an abusively monetized game. It is a great game that just happens to use new technology in cryptography and blockchains to their advantage, rather than shoehorn them in.\n\nIt also isn’t funded through venture capital, instead relying on community and non-profit funding sources. So [don’t worry Jack](https://fortune.com/2021/12/23/web3-elon-musk-marc-andreessen-jack-dorsey-twitter-fight/), [no a16z or VCs on their GitCoin page](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2323/dark-forest) or [funding page](https://0xparc.org/about)! Raising venture capital is fine (I’ve done it!), but in this case the developers truly have put the game and the community first.\n\n### About Me\n\nYou can skip this part if you just want to read about Dark Forest; it just contextualizes my motivation.\n\nI’m a huge gamer (hello, fellow kids!). I’ve religiously grinded the online competitive ladders of StarCraft 2, [League of Legends](https://na.op.gg/summoners/na/prostyler), and [Valorant](https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/Prostyler%23NA1/overview). You can [stat check my Steam profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/omarziprostyle/) if you want to know more about my tastes.\n\nI’m also [a developer and a founder](https://www.omarmezenner.com/) in the web3 space. I think I’m in a unique position to speak about the web3 gaming experience. I know a lot more needs to be delivered before reasonable skeptics can see past crypto’s current failings. I’m an optimist that believes eventually cryptography and web3 tech can re-empower users on web platforms, and I’m trying to build that reality.\n\nAnd if you don’t believe me, again, check my gaming habits! I promise Axie Infinity is nowhere to be found in [my wallet](https://rainbow.me/omarmezenner.eth). I did spend a month as a child catching all 150 Pokemon in the original games with a[ link cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Link_Cable), 2 Gameboys, and the holy trinity of Red / Blue / Yellow versions. I’ve got no on-chain proof for that, though… only PTSD of the Safari Zone….\n\n![Wasn't stoning a punishment in the Bible and Quran? Why would these animals ever be your pet?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NiBlJKyuT5-PFQyE157fC.png?height=360&width=1440)\n\n### A Quick Overview of Dark Forest\n\nDark Forest is a browser-based 2.5D (2D plane, 3D assets) game that takes place in “rounds”, with each round lasting a few days (the current round is underway and will last 10 days). If the following in-game image makes your eyes bleed, the gameplay might still make you stay!\n\n![An overview of my quaint civilization. And no, I won't ever activate Windows.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1ygHpDmmYZ9W66vhpJF7D.png?height=808&width=1600)\n\nGenerally, a few months pass between rounds, which players use to plan for the next round. The current round in February preceded by one last year in October, and game mechanics are added between rounds. While a round is underway, players try to earn the highest score on the leaderboard, viewable in [real-time on the homepage](https://zkga.me/). (Yeah, I’m not doing too hot. And yeah, [the CEO of Figma](https://twitter.com/zoink) won the first round). The top ranked 63 players at the end of a round get a reward from the devs, but otherwise you just play for fun.\n\nThe core game loop is:\n\n* All players spawn with a home planet and vision over a small area in their corner of the universe, with fog of war (i.e. no vision) covering the map\n* Planets have energy that regenerates over time\n* You send energy from your planets to other planets to conquer them\n* Some planets have “silver” and “artifacts” which give you points that determine your rank\n* You break the fog of war with an “explorer” whose speed is dictated by the compute power of the real life, physical computer you’re playing on\n\nIf it all sounded great until that last point, hear me out. No, this isn’t some shadow-realm version of [Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boktai:_The_Sun_Is_in_Your_Hand) where you destroy the environment to play. Nor is the game pay-to-win. Nor is it using [your browser to mine Monero](https://coingeek.com/in-browser-monero-mining-service-coinhive-to-shut-down-operations/).\n\nFirst, AFAICT the game’s miner seems to have fairly limited scaling capability, with a [Raspberry Pi giving reasonable performance](https://github.com/projectsophon/darkforest-rs/tree/main/mimc-fast) (1-2k hashes/sec is roughly equivalent to my browser using a Ryzen 3600 XT & 2 cores). On the backend the game runs on the [Gnosis Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/) (an Ethereum sidechain — don’t worry if this means nothing to you for now), which is Proof of Stake, not Proof of Work. Shadow-realm Hideo Kojima still has a game to make.\n\nSecond, yes – faster computers have an advantage. It’s not as big as you’d think (running on 16 cores vs 2 cores is \\~2.5x better, and 16 vs 4 is \\~1.7x, so diminishing returns kick in). The bigger advantage comes from using a “remote hasher”, which is a separate server that does hashing. But in the early game, you’re mostly limited by your strategy, not the fog of war. In the mid-game, players need to direct their explorer’s search regardless of how much compute they have. If I were to make an analogy to other competitive online games, having a large amount of compute would be like playing a First-Person Shooter a la CS:GO or Valorant with a 240 Hz monitor and a low-latency connection. It makes a difference, but anyone can upgrade their gear to be at their competitive best. You can still have fun and be competitive without top gear.\n\nThird, if you’re afraid the game might be using your computer for nefarious purposes, it’s all open source (both the [code ](https://github.com/darkforest-eth)and the live smart contracts and frontend). If you don’t have the skill to audit it, then yes, you’ll have to trust a friend or someone else to do it for you. When I quickly read through it, it looked good, promise. You won’t be sending any excellent privacy coins to anyone.\n\n(That last part was a joke, please don’t buy or mine Monero if you’re trying to make a quick buck.)\n\nThere are other mechanics like upgrading planets, a planet leveling system (you progressively conquer larger planets as you expand), and “artifacts” that boost your planets’ creation of energy and other resources. These feel natural and are staples of any good strategy game, but the tech tree is less developed than the richness of a Civilization entry, and there isn’t customization on the level of Stellaris.\n\nWhat Dark Forest lacks in more traditional strategy game features it makes up for in competitive Player vs Player (PvP) design, though.\n\n### Competition in Dark Forest\n\nDark Forest’s ladder and competitive rewards are sort of similar to other online games like League of Legends. There’s a publicly viewable leaderboard and end-of-season ranked rewards. What’s unique about Dark Forest’s leaderboard is that the game doesn’t use an “Elo system” or feature any skill-based matchmaking at all, which is a departure from the most popular competitive games today. Instead, all players compete with all other players within a round. This may not seem like it sets up the average player for a good time, but we’ll touch on how this doesn’t lead to new players getting Goomba stomped by more skilled ones.\n\nPlayers earn points by interacting with the game universe – either discovering “artifacts” on conquered planets, or exchanging “silver” for points. Players interact with other players’ planets using the same moves as they would an unconquered planet. The only difference is that players can beef up their planets’ defense so it requires more energy to capture. So rather than a “Player vs. Environment” (PvE) MMO experience, the resources themselves are a battleground for “Player vs. Player” (PvP) gameplay.\n\nNote that the exact competitive mechanics change between rounds, for e.g. there has also been a [“race to the center”](https://blog.zkga.me/v6-r3-wrapup) round, which keeps the game fresh.\n\nThis is where the titular mechanic of “a dark forest” comes in. Since there are finite resources and you expand to the edges of your fog of war, you might think that you must “tread without sound” while exploring the universe. I.e. you should avoid other players. Hey, you’d be in good company, sci-fi [author Liu Cixin](https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/the-dark-forest-theory-a-terrifying-explanation-of-why-we-havent-heard-from-aliens-yet/) thought that, and he inspired the game!\n\nSurely you wouldn’t want to discover a player more advanced than you, with more planets and energy, and have them conquer you. And on the flipside, if you encountered a less progressed player you’d crush them under your thumb!\n\nIt turns out, it’s not that simple.\n\n### Strategy in Dark Forest\n\nThe multiplayer metagame is where the strength of Dark Forest’s game design emerges. The current round of the game offers a few interesting levers to reign in more progressed players and generate more sophisticated strategies than “more planets = more energy = me strong!!”. (Note again that these mechanics and the win conditions change from round to round. There’s a good [write-up of a previous round’s strategy](https://blog.zkga.me/the-art-of-dark-forest-war)).\n\nFirst, engaging with similarly progressed players is encouraged through a “junk” cap on how many planets you have conquered. This is similar to “population” in StarCraft, except, sorry, you can’t [construct additional pylons here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCysnsJ4XUA)! Your junk limit is fixed at the start of the round, and each planet comes with junk if it’s unoccupied. I.e., players are incentivized to take already-conquered planets since they’re free of junk. Otherwise players must abandon old, smaller planets to free their junk limit and expand. Since smaller conquered planets typically have their silver and artifacts removed, this mainly pushes similarly progressed players to war over conquered-but-unmined planets.\n\nSecond, actions take time to perform. No, not because there’s a lot of clicking (there is, but more on automation with the plugin system in a bit). Once you decide to send a resource – energy, silver, artifacts, or ships – to another planet, actually sending that resource takes real world time proportional to the distance it must travel. In the early game, this is on the order of a few dozen seconds. In the mid-game, this turns into tens of minutes! There’s no worse feeling than knowing you’ve executed a poor game plan while there’s still 20 minutes before your stuff has arrived. The high latency between actions and outcomes rewards sophisticated planners and not the ones with the highest actions per minute APM ([sorry MarineKing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFmq-Q_ObdQ), this one ain’t for you).\n\nThird, there is a “Broadcast” mechanic that allows a player to reveal the location of a planet through the fog of war, *whether owned or unowned by them,* every few hours. This leads to emergent meta-strategies around large resources. Need a bit of help to make sure a nearby expanding neighbor has to worry about multiple encroaching players? If you’re ranked 64 and 65, why not join forces if you stumble upon a top-63 player?\n\nFourth, taking an action costs real-world money. Don’t worry, I won’t be shilling a shitcoin and I’ll explain what the payment stuff is like next. The important thing to know is that choosing the *right* action matters, because you’re wasting money otherwise.\n\n### “Aha there is money involved! I won’t be buying your shitcoin!”\n\nYes, you have to pay to play Dark Forest. But you pay in a USD stablecoin (xDai) so the price doesn’t fluctuate and you aren’t pumping some trending coin on Twitter. For the current round one action (e.g. sending energy to a planet) costs $0.002 (2/10ths of a cent). I paid \\~$0.50 to play for ten hours but it’ll depend on your gameplay. All players received $0.15 at the start of the round from the devs. I put $10 into my wallet to play when that ran out.\n\nThe money you pay doesn’t go back to the devs – it’s a “gas fee” you pay to save your action to the network (in this case, an Ethereum sidechain called the [Gnosis Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/), formerly the xDai Chain).\n\nIf you enjoy the game, you can buy in-game hats to support the devs. Yes, hats, like the kind on your head or in Team Fortress 2. I bought a Fez hat for one of my planets for $1\n\n![Cute, right?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PKmN71OAhnsBmnzDk5UW8.png?height=490&width=507)\n\nWas it worth it? Hey –[ I report, you decide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News#Slogan).\n\n### A Side Note on Play-to-Earn (P2E)\n\n“Ugh… it’s crypto, just tell me how to make money playing this…” is probably what you’re thinking. Again, I’m not hiding anything – you really don’t make money playing Dark Forest. You really do have to enjoy it and find it worth paying to play.\n\nDark Forest is not play-to-earn (P2E) like other crypto games (e.g. [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/)) are. The top ranked 63 players at the end of a round do get an NFT prize. Since it’s an NFT, it can be sold like any other NFT on the Ethereum network. It’s my understanding that in some previous early releases, the top players got a cash prize (paid in USD-equivalent crypto tokens), but this was a small amount ($1,000 pool).\n\nBefore you claim “NFT trading? that’s P2E!” I would ask you to think hard about what P2E means. The NFTs you earn after a round of Dark Forest are akin to an end-of-season reward on a competitive game’s ranked ladder. They’re a personal achievement. Is League of Legends P2E because you can sell a Challenger-tier (the highest competitive ranking) account for[ a few hundred dollars](https://www.playerauctions.com/lol-account/challenger/)? While most players with a challenger account would be proud of their rank and never think to resell, some people really do make a living flipping high ranked accounts. E.g. a top ranked Korean League of Legends player, “Dopa”,[ has been banned from competitive play in Riot’s professional league for selling his high-ranked accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4b2cyj/dopa_apdo_has_been_banned_by_riot_korea/).\n\nPersonally, I think a variation of P2E is inevitable in online games, like the freemium model before it. Dedicated player communities generate a lot of value for a game, whether through streaming, professional play, community art & music, guides, or other content. It’s up to publishers to figure out how best to craft the experience. Even Riot bootstrapped their professional scene by paying $25k/year salaries to players early on! That’s P2E! Just for a small subset of very skilled players.\n\nIf you still think Dark Forest and all games with secondary economies are P2E then sure, you can snip this section, add it to [web3isgoinggreat.com](https://web3isgoinggreat.com) and dunk me on your social media platform of choice! I’m making an argument of degree (the play-to-earn moniker depends on how a game is monetized and the player experience; just as a game with real-money items is not necessarily pay-to-win). You’re making an argument of kind (players making money off of a game makes it P2E). We fundamentally disagree on the definition of that phrase and you can evaluate whether Dark Forest is still worth playing on other terms.\n\n### Plugins & Programmability\n\nPlugins are probably the single biggest feature I’m excited to spend “playtime” on in Dark Forest. Plugins let you write short Javascript programs to manipulate the game. You [can find a list of them here](https://plugins.zkga.me/), and they range anywhere from “show an outline around my planets” to “automatically conquer all planets fitting these criteria around a center point”.\n\n![Copy-pasting 200 lines of Javascript gave me a nice little slider to find my planets on the map! It ain’t much but it’s honest gaming](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LE2rTuC9fGbSdMySRAiQQ.png?height=449&width=691)\n\nBy my estimation, most of the top players in Dark Forest have automated the bulk of their gameplay via plugins or writing programs that interact with the game’s backend directly. After playing for 10 hours, I only had 300,005 points, whereas other players had 2500x as much, despite only playing for 4 more days. Rewards aren’t linear with game time but they don’t scale *that* aggressively AFAICT.\n\nYou might be thinking “wait, if it can automate game actions… and this is browser based… isn’t that like cheating? And how does the game stop people from cheating? Isn’t the blockchain public? Can’t shadowy super coders data mine where I am?”.\n\nThis is the coolest part about how Dark Forest is built. How can the game 1) run in a browser, 2) on a public blockchain, 3) allow modding, but 4) have no cheating? (Ok, there are [bugs](https://blog.zkga.me/artifact-minting-exploit) - that’s not the same).\n\nIt’s because the player actions are encoded with something called “[Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://blog.zkga.me/df-init-circuit)”. Yes, I can see your eyes glaze over – don’t worry, I’ve saved the nerdy stuff for the next section on blockchain & cryptography. The point is, even though your actions  are recorded on a public blockchain, they’re hidden with a kind of cryptographically-secured game engine. So while you can automate your own actions, you can’t do more than “click faster” with automation --  the game’s backend can verify that the moves you submit must be legal and protects itself from denial of service attacks. And even with automation, you *still* need a guiding strategy to effectively compete with other players.\n\nThe other benefit of the game’s backend and state being public on-chain is that *other* games can plug into the Dark Forest ecosystem. Without having to construct a formal agreement with the Dark Forest team! This is equivalent to an open API, similar to Riot’s API for it’s titles, and is often referred to as “composability” in web3 parlance. If you’ve ever played an online game where your Twitch Prime subscription unlocks items or skins, a la Epic’s Fortnite or Riot’s Valorant, this effectively allows for that same experience but for any developer, without API rate limits, and unconstrained to the limited features the publisher exposes.\n\nAnd this goes beyond extending the game’s capabilities -- since users are on-chain addresses, player guilds (in MMOs, guild are groups of allied players) can be formulated as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). [Guilds can then re-appropriate tools to vote for on decisions](https://mirror.xyz/wbarobinson.eth/wBckyakVfD4op3eO0a0viWvwoNsm4YfvCKQ-JBfg5d4)! No more spamming in-game guild chat or impersonating players on private guild forums! [Will Robinson](https://mirror.xyz/wbarobinson.eth) has a full series on his experience as part of a Dark Forest guild.\n\n### Whatever Happened to Mods, Anyway?\n\nThis brings us to a more general point about mods. With all of the cool stuff you can build using mods, why is it so rare to find a rich mod framework for any new games, much less a multiplayer game these days? Well, for multiplayer games it makes sense, developers don’t want yet another vector of cheating or other more subtle competitive advantages. Riot has a [thorough third party application policy for their games](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848-Third-Party-Applications#:\\~:text=Riot's%20Stance&text=Third%2Dparty%20applications%20are%20programs,that%20provide%20measurable%20player%20advantage.). Hell, they’ve been [criticized for installing “a rootkit” on players’ computers](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/g02ggb/valorant_anticheat_starts_upon_computer_boot_and/) to ensure Valorant has an impeccable anti-cheat system (it works well btw, no complaints from me).\n\nBut in giving up mods, I think the gaming community has lost out on an immeasurably large amount of rich new gaming experiences. Seriously, this isn’t hyperbole – it’s a hard counterfactual to prove, but the history of modding makes a strong case. Sure, [Skyrim mods](https://www.pcgamer.com/best-skyrim-special-edition-mods/) are amazing and add cool stuff. But the most revelatory story is the birth of League of Legends, DOTA, and the MOBA genre.\n\nDOTA and League of Legends came from a [series of mods of Warcraft 3, notably DOTA: All Stars by a developer named Guinsoo](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-08-16-the-story-of-dota-article). The mod was eventually passed on to another, pseudonymous developer named IceFrog. Guinsoo eventually went on to work at Riot Games on League of Legends and IceFrog went to work at Valve on Dota 2. Today Riot’s League of Legends boasts [180 million monthly players](https://www.pcgamer.com/with-180-million-players-league-of-legends-games-have-more-active-users-than-steam/) and [more than a billion in revenue](https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-lol-revenue/report-league-of-legends-produced-1-75-billion-in-revenue-in-2020-idUSFLM2vzDZL). It’s at the vanguard of the esports scene with hundreds of professional players globally. And it all started from a mod and some pseudonymous devs circa 2005!\n\nThe ironic, unfortunate thing is that Dota 2 and League of Legends don’t have mods. Players are still creative – the popular “All Random All Mid (ARAM)” mode in League of Legends started as an unofficial custom game format in the community before getting productized. What new phenoms would we have if these games turned themselves into true platforms?\n\n### Blockchains for Free Game Backends\n\nAll of the prior stuff may have you excited, but still wondering “...so why is this built on that Big Bad Blockchain thing again? I’d like my earthly oceans unboiled, thank you.” I’ll go deeper here. Fair warning this is going to get nerdy.\n\nFirst, the game runs on the [Gnosis Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/) which is Proof of Stake. No boiling oceans here! If you don’t know what that means, instead of crunching numbers (Proof of Work), the network is secured by people dumping a million bucks onto a computer in the form of tokens and saying “I won’t lie, fingers crossed winky face!\\~ Oh but if I do then you get to take all my money!\\~”. The network is Ethereum-compatible so when Ethereum swaps over to Proof of Stake, the game may move off of this sidechain. It doesn’t really matter to players either way.\n\nSecond, the game’s designed to run on basically no developer-owned servers. The game logic runs only on players’ machines and the Gnosis blockchain. Turns out the devs ain’t paying the infrastructure bills because they don’t have any. They do have some nominal bills for their website I’m sure, but the actual backend logic that you’d normally have to run in a data center isn’t costing them anything. $0.\n\nConcurrent interacting players is something MMOs normally struggle with, because it’s a hard problem (you have to resolve O(N^2) player interactions for N players). Developers use tricks to get around this like having small zones, making some actions unimportant like player collision, and splitting playerbases into different instances. Dark Forest is no different -- blockchains don’t have high throughput. The game’s use of “[Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://blog.zkga.me/df-init-circuit)” (ZKPs) affords them a clever workaround. We’ll touch on these more in the next sections, but the main problem here is that Dark Forest must support many concurrent players within a round, but they can’t validate every little interaction a player makes like a real-time MMO a la World of Warcraft does.\n\nServer costs are real, ask any developer that supports a few thousand players! Even [a simple Minecraft server with 20 players can you a few thousand in initial setup costs](https://www.servermania.com/kb/articles/how-much-does-a-minecraft-server-cost/#:\\~:text=A%20server%20for%2020%20players,to%20run%20the%20Minecraft%20server.) and a few dozen in recurring costs. And this will scale up, depending on how many players you want to support. Dark Forest elegantly skirts recurring infrastructure costs via it’s game design and using a blockchain for it’s backend.\n\nIn a communication with the Dark Forest dev team, they told me they spent more on Github than they did on any cloud costs (e.g. their blog/static site)! And this won’t suddenly start going up when they scale to more than a few hundred players!\n\n### Cutting-edge Cryptography For Secure Game Frontends\n\nIf you’re a security-minded developer there’ve probably been some alarm bells going off in your head. Maybe akin to, “the game accepts actions client-side… in a web browser… this guy is fucking clown. Why have I read this far?”. Hold on. To explain how the game accepts rich actions executed in a player’s browser without cheating, we need to touch on [Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://blog.zkga.me/df-init-circuit) (ZKPs).\n\nEvery action a player takes in Dark Forest produces a ZKP (a string of bits that follow some cryptographic properties). The ZKP is submitted to the game’s backend, where it’s cryptographically verified to have followed the game’s logic. This allows for richer actions to be taken client-side  without having a ton of chatter between front- and backends of the game. Here’s how it works in practice:\n\nFirst, a ZKP lets another computer verify that a *specific kind of computation* was performed. In particular, when constructing a ZKP, a computation must match a pre-specified boolean logic circuit. For example, you can produce a ZKP of an addition of two binary numbers.  This is the “proof” part of a ZKP. This lets each player run rich logic for their gameplay client-side, instead of sending individual inputs or commands to a central server that validates each command separately.\n\nIn the case of Dark Forest, game logic includes things like checking whether sending energy to another planet is valid by ensuring the target planet’s location falls within a certain valid radius. [The developers wrote a blog post that goes into more detail about their ZKP circuits](https://blog.zkga.me/df-init-circuit).\n\nSecond, the ZKP does not reveal *any other information* about the computation. Seriously, nothing else. Not the inputs. Not the outputs. For example, you can prove you’ve calculated w=(x+y)\\*z without telling me what w, x, y, z or the answer are. This is the “zero knowledge” part of a ZKP. The backend verifies the client’s ZKP to ensure it was valid.\n\nYes, this is mind-melting.\n\nThe combination of a decentralized database (here, a public blockchain that stores the game state but that can’t process a ton of real-time simple inputs) and decentralized compute (ZKPs created in players’ web browsers) lets the game run in a performant manner, without cheating, and with mods.\n\nThat’s the magic behind how Dark Forest works.\n\nIn case this isn’t quite clicking & you’re a curious developer, I recommend [this repo of Battleship done via ZKPs](https://github.com/kunalmodi/battlesnark) by [Kunal Modi](https://twitter.com/kunal_modi), a colleague from South Park Commons. He also [has a write-up](https://kunalm.xyz/posts/zksnark-battleship.html).\n\n![A quick demo of how you could decentralize a multi-player Battleship](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/phH7dV3rXVI98JH9h2XWm.png?height=641&width=1500)\n\nI had another paragraph here explaining ZKPs with an analogy of a computer crunching numbers and how only you, as the chef of those crunchy numbers, could appreciate them. I axed it. No crunchy numbers today.\n\nSigh… math seems cool until you have to learn it well enough to teach it…\n\n### Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Zero-Context Buzzwords\n\nDoes this sound *too* magical? A little *too* good to be true? Wouldn’t ZKPs solve a few *other* privacy problems? Maybe they could put an end to those annoying cookie banner ads? Why don’t all multiplayer games use them to prevent cheating? In fact, shouldn’t these things be used everywhere? At least for a few other useful things? Maybe [proving that Berenstein Bears is really spelled Berenstain Bears](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-people-have-such-strong-feelings-about-the-spelling-of-the-berenstain-bears)?\n\nThe truth is, they’re legitimately new technology. Not new as in “Gee willikers, that internet thing is new!”. New as in the compilers and software to create ZKP circuits [are 2 years old at the time of writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof#Zero-Knowledge_Proof_Protocols). Sorry, #TeamBerenstAin – the past is the past but the future can still be saved.\n\nThe price of casting a spell with this arcane, dark magick technology is… computations take a really really long time. Like, *seconds* to do basic stuff like arithmetic, even on today’s hardware. If you can write code, try to go through a [SnarkJS ](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)or [Circom ](https://github.com/iden3/circom)tutorial or run a sample app. I instrumented & ran [this repo of Battleship done via ZKPs](https://github.com/kunalmodi/battlesnark) so you can see for yourself.\n\n![A few seconds to make a few moves in Battleship, oof](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TT9KnBh70FIQxe9dcp3g8.png?height=246&width=1050)\n\nZKPs are slow. Devs needs to be clever about their usage. Imagine if adding a few numbers took a few seconds. We’d be back like 100 years in terms of compute power? Yikes.\n\nYet that’s the price you pay if you want a massively multiplayer game that can run on player machines without cheating, at no marginal infrastructure cost to the developers.\n\nIt’s good news! Culture isn’t stuck and the internet isn’t dead. Yaaaay! Ok so it’s slow, but we can make new hardware and software to make it fast. And things will get better, not just for games, but for all types of privacy-preserving applications. No one needs to shill Monero any more, woot woo (kidding, no one knows what Monero is any more)!\n\n### The Team is Obviously Good\n\nRemember my planet with the fez hat? Dark Forest using hats to monetize is a proof-point for how the development team is made of passionate gamers. Yes, it’s an in-joke that references another game that only some will understand. Even if you don’t understand the joke, it’s a signal that the team is not a fan of “pay-to-win” mechanics. This is despite the frothy market for such mechanics in existing games, crypto or not (enjoy paying for another [DLC season pass](https://www.pcgamesn.com/dear-everyone-its-time-to-stop-buying-season-passes-at-launch) for a $60 AAA game or buying your first Axie! Ok, Axie prices seem to have gone down, but I’m still not playing.).\n\nYou can also read their [blog ](https://blog.zkga.me/)to find plenty of community-oriented educational content. Not just on game design decisions! They’re also bringing the cutting edge, dark magic whose mere utterance turns an anonymous Twitter anime profile-pic goon into an S-tier technologi– ok I’ll stop. They’re making Zero Knowledge Proofs more accessible to the broader software development community. Yes, you can cynically say “that's just content marketing for recruiting!” But it’s still great educational content! Plenty of tech companies have useful write-ups on their blogs. I benefitted greatly from them as a young engineer in Silicon Valley! And again, the team’s funded via donations and grants – check[ their funding page](https://0xparc.org/about) or [their Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2323/dark-forest). No implicit growth mandate! Yaaaay [regenerative economics](https://capitalinstitute.org/8-principles-regenerative-economy/).\n\nAside from blog content, there was an IRL meet-up at ETHDenver (which in dramatic irony I didn’t attend since 1) I just received my beta key, but 2) I had to fly to ETHDenver!). The team is active on their Discord. The pace of development and beta access shows they’d rather craft a great game for a few hundred players and make sure it can scale up before showing it to everyone.\n\nThere’s a famous Shigeru Miyamoto quote about how [ “a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad”](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/apr/27/shigeru-miyamoto-rushed-game-forever-bad). You may believe the quote is outdated since we’re in a world of online-connected games. Weekly or monthly patches that adjust gameplay are common. Hell, Riot practically re-released League of Legends 3 times with all of the visual and gameplay updates they shipped over the past 10 years! Surely a development team can launch early and fix a game based on player feedback – that’s the Lean Startup way!\n\n![Small batch & handmade – we like our games like we do our ice cream.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kOjHtbGRbGBwYED9ObzUn.png?height=512&width=1200)\n\n([Here’s the above ice cream recipe, btw](https://buttermilkbysam.com/easy-homemade-1-pint-ice-cream/).)\n\nThere are subtleties and limits to the iterative approach of building products, games included, that make it hard for teams to get right. Development teams (even at mature, successful companies) can have egos, limited budgets, or a weak community muscle – it’s true! Anyone who has played both CS:GO (by Valve) and Valorant (by Riot) will tell you that a team’s specific approach to tweaking their game matters, and not all are equally skilled at interacting with their player communities. In a competitive game it’s particularly important. It’s the difference between a stale, solved game that only the most dedicated players can enjoy, and an interesting game that continuously appeals to all skill levels with a flourishing grassroots esports scene. (For anyone unfamiliar, Riot is better at this, don’t @ me).\n\n### It’s Not Perfect; It Doesn’t Need to Be Perfect\n\nThe game is in closed beta so yes, there are issues.\n\nIf everything above sounded super nerdy, even for gamers, you might think Dark Forest is more like Eve Online than League of Legends. A cool part of internet gaming subculture? Sure. But not for the masses, just like blockchains.\n\nDuring a previous round the Gnosis Chain was congested and couldn’t handle traffic, so players started [running their own blockchain infrastructure nodes](https://blog.zkga.me/v4-recap)! Would the average Eve player do that? Maybe. The average League player? Eh, they’d sooner be caught running it down mid than running a piece of infra.\n\nBut there are also legitimate problems with the game as-is. The frame rate isn’t great. The community wiki isn’t fully up-to-date. The number of players and invite key list is small so you can’t talk to your friends about it. The new player experience is confusing (I personally re-onboarded 2 other new players at South Park Commons who were discouraged after onboarding friction). Half the plugins I tried didn’t work. Technically the way they store the wallet you use to pay gas fees isn’t super secure (it uses localstorage – if that is gibberish to you just [know it has pitfalls](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220660/local-storage-vs-cookies) but isn’t the end of the world).\n\nBut the kernel of the game and the direction of the team is enough for me to get invested (no no, not with a shitcoin, with my *time*) as a player. I trust the team to carry the game forward and listen to the player community.\n\nMore importantly, they’ve given me renewed optimism on the promise of web3 – that even if it’s not for you today, it will come to you in due time. Not because you can make a quick buck, but because the new experiences created will be worth it! \n  \n And if you want to build the next Dark Forest, hit me up at omar@exaverse.io :)\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nI’d like to thank Cameron Tuckerman-Lee & Stan Kirdey from South Park Commons and @gubsheep & Ivan Chub (@chubivan) from the Dark Forest team for helpful feedback on this post.

Vitalik 等论文摘要\n\n《去中心化社会：找寻 Web3 的灵魂》是 Vitalik 等人联合发表的最新论文，本文讲述了如何通过 “灵魂绑定” Token（本质上来说就是 DID）来建立一个更加多元、丰富的 Desoc（去中心化社会）。论文内容非常长，本文将对这篇论文的重要观点进行转述与总结，这样读者很快就能了解去中心化社会有关知识了。\n\n### 1.1 Web3成立之初的局限性\n\n在不到十年的时间里，Web3 创造了一个庞大的金融帝国，这一成就令世界瞩目，连 facebook 都以 all in 的形式参与到这场金融盛宴之中。加密和经济领域的基础元素，为金融交易带来了一个丰富、开放且多元的生态系统。但是这个过程中出现了一个矛盾，金融交易的经济价值是由人们现实生活中的社会关系等决定的，也就是说它的内部运转逻辑并不完善甚至可以说并不完整。正是由于 Web3 缺乏代表社会身份的基础元素，它从根本上依赖于它所要超越的中心化的 Web2 结构，这具有非常大的局限性。\n\n这种依赖性在具体应用方面也有很明显的体现：\n\n* 虽然 NFT 通过 Opensea 等去中心化平台进行交易，但是许多 NFT 艺术家会通过 Twitter 等中心化平台进行宣传，以向人们证明其真实性并达到推广的目的\n* 各种去中心化项目经常依赖 Web2 基础设施来实施投票\n* 许多 Web3 参与者依赖 Coinbase 或 Binance 等中心化实体管理的托管钱包\n\n此外由于缺乏原生的 Web3 身份，今天的 DeFi 生态系统无法支持实体经济中普遍存在的活动，如等额抵押贷款甚至超低额抵押贷款（目前加密贷款平台一般只支持超额抵押）或者签订公寓租赁等合同。在此我们试图通过“灵魂绑定”的 Token（“soulbound” tokens，SBTs，也就是 DID 去中心化身份）来打破这些局限。除此以外通过 Web3 社会身份，还可以就财富集中和金融攻击的治理脆弱性等更广泛的长期问题上取得巨大进展，同时刺激 web3 的政治、经济和社会应用的大幅发展。我们把这些用例和它们所促成的更丰富的多元生态系统称为“去中心化社会”（DeSoc）。**本文第二部分会就 web2 的社交与 Desoc 进行对比进一步展示出 Desoc 的一些特点与优势。**\n\n### 1.2 Desoc 的要素与畅想\n\n首先我们应先了解一下 DeSoc 的基本元素，它（“灵魂绑定” Token, SBTs） 围绕着人们持有的不可转让的账户（或钱包），代表着承诺、证书和关系，这种 Token 就像一份扩展的简历。可以简单地把这种东西理解为我们的身份证，有了身份证我们就可以缴纳社保、绑定银行卡等。没有身份证或者说法律认可的身份这些都很难实现，而目前的 web3 就处在这种没有身份证明的困局当中。在这里把起身份证明的东西被称为“灵魂”， 将账户持有的 Token 称为“灵魂 Token”（SBTs）。\n\n想象一下这样一个世界，大多数参与者都有“灵魂 Token”，它对应一系列的关系、会员资格和证书。因此人们不用公开自己的真实身份，就可以让他人看到自己的教育证书，就业历史，或自己的著作或艺术作品的一串哈希值，这种 Token 对相关信息的公开类似于人们在简历中分享关于自己的信息。更重要的是，通过这种身份人们可以互相识别，甚至可以实现目前无法达到的等额抵押、合同签订等。人们甚至可以无纸化，因为数据可以记录一切，并且因为它不可篡改的特点，又让一切变得更加可信。在这些技术的支持下 web3 一定会越来越丰富且美好。\n\n### 1.3 相关实例\n\n**艺术与“灵魂”**\n\n艺术家可以通过“灵魂”将作品与自己连接。当发行可交易的 NFT 时，艺术家可以从他们的“灵魂”中发行 NFT。艺术家的“灵魂”携带的 SBTs 越多，买家就越容易识别出“灵魂”是属于该艺术家的，从而也就能确定 NFT 的真实性。艺术家可以更进一步，在他们的“灵魂”中发布一个链接的 SBTs，证明某个 NFT 是该“系列藏品”的成员。因此，“灵魂”将创造一种可靠的、链上的交易和识别方式。 很明显，它的现实应用还有很多，NFT 艺术家的例子只是其中最具有代表性的。实际上，除了 web3 领域外，它也能有解决一些现实问题，比如知识产权、司法文件真伪判断等。毕竟随着深度造假技术的进步，人类和算法的直接检查将越来越无法检测真实性。虽然区块链的加入使我们能够追踪特定作品的制作时间，但 SBTs 将使我们能够追踪相关内容的社会出处，为我们提供丰富的社会背景，让我们了解发布作品的人的“灵魂”——他们的会员资格、关系、证书的组合。通过这种方式“高仿”可以很容易地被识别出来。\n\n**“灵魂”空投**\n\n在具体说明“灵魂”空投之前我们需要明白空投是什么，以及空投的意义到底是什么？区块链领域的空投是一种将数字货币通过区块链技术大规模分发到一些已有的数字货币钱包上的行为，比如以太币、比特币、EOS.IO 钱包。简单来说就是向广大网友“发钱”的过程。\n\n当面对空投人们会有四种行为：（1）上网搜索相关内容（2）和朋友聊相关内容，使朋友知晓有关信息（3）之前或者之后疯狂注册账号，以获得空投（4）直接无视\n\n空投本身是一种非常流行的营销策略，并不是所谓的“慈善”，因此在上述几种情况中，（3）和（4）属于无效空投，并不能带来实际的收益或者说宣传的效果。而其中的第三条属于危害性最大的一条，也就是常说的女巫攻击。为了避免第三条项目方往往设立许多空投限制，但是很明显并不能完全避免。通过 DID 可以有效解决上述问题，因为项目方可以依据 DID 进行空投，可以有效提高投放的精准性和准确性。\n\n论文中的相关例子还有很多这里就不多做列举了，如果感兴趣可以点击[论文原文](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763)进行细致了解。\n\n很显然，上文那两个所谓的相关实例都还是比较理想化的概念。**本文将于第三部分举出一些现有的比较具有代表性的相关去中心化项目，各位读者可以通过这些例子对相关内容予以把握。同时会在第四部分就上文提到的 DID 的使用、价值和发展前景进行详细的说明。**\n\n### 1.4 结论\n\n通过这篇文章大家可以预见到 Desoc 的美好未来，但同时也需要意识到 DID 只是这一远大历程中的一小步。此外，上面描述的场景只是 DeSoc 对现有项目与应用的强化作用，但是并没有涉及对比如物理、政治、社会以及它们与现实世界的复杂关系的描述，而它们实际上占据了我们现实生活的很大比例。所有这些都表明，上面描绘的远大理想，可能只是 DeSoc 最终形态的“雏形”。**论文中就 SBTs 的威胁与挑战也进行了比较细致的描述，在本文的第五部分将结合现实情况进行细致描写这里就不再细说。**\n\n# 2.  新型社交为何悄然而至\n\n### 2.1 Web2.0 传统社交弊病\n\nWeb2.0本质是平台经济，是以一小撮为代表的垄断性寡头构架，互联网在该阶段变成全民级别应用，聚集了社交、搜索、电商等超级生态应用开发，且每个行业领域龙头公司几乎垄断行业资源和发展上限，这使得Web2公司在拥有最终解释权的情况下去剥削和占有用户资源信息时游刃有余，例如微信和QQ在中国产生的影响力和不可置换性，使得用户无法维护本身利益，用户在Web2.0中更像是平台的附庸而不是服务接收者。而Web3.0是属于Token经济的后端程序革命，其本意是在为非平台内部的生态参与者获取更多的话语权和创造权，并拥有产品本身的价值支配权利，以及隐私性和安全性。一定程度的避免了不平衡的垄断机制。\n\n### 2.2 SocialFi 是 Web3.0 的必要组件\n\nSocialFi的出现是对抗传统社交平台弊端的必要产物，Web2.0 时代的社交平台被各大运营巨头控制，从用户数据中获取商业价值，忽略用户的感受。SocialFi基于区块链技术，用户身份信息的匿名性有助于保护隐私和安全，更有利于解决用户数据的确认问题以及权利下放。\n\n相信随着用户对于隐私以及自由的追求，越来越多的人会投身于Web3.0的世界，在用户渴望加密技术带给的数据主权时也渴望获得自己在这个世界独特的身份和地位。在Web2.0-3.0过渡的过程中，互联网用户需要一些中间件来从简单迁移到复杂，从而从原始空间迁移到元空间。元空间的实现需要从现有的互联网世界出发，利用一系列的Web3.0组件，分批分阶段的迎接新的用户。在尝试了Defi的去中心化资产流、NFT的数字工作价值、发现Gamefi的P2E之后，去中心化的意见发布和个人展示已经下一个需要探索和开发的Web3.0组件，在互联网发展历史中可以发现社交化可以说是网民的刚性需求。\n\n### 2.3 线上数据分析\n\n根据[Zippa](https://www.zippia.com/advice/cryptocurrency-statistics/)的统计以及交易平台和钱包的来源，2018-2020 年全球加密货币用户群增加了近 190%，2021 年进一步加速。 数据的增加可能是由于账户数量的增加以及身份识别的改进，以及在 2021 年特斯拉和万事达卡等公司宣布进军加密货世界等从热度上升带来的用户数量造成的。下图展示了Web3.0近几年来的趋势变化：         \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jov7Glf5pfabWlpkN1DD0.png?height=482&width=1141)\n\n根据Google Search数据统计，如今的互联网 2.0 使用用户约在 49.5 亿人左右，对标3亿的加密用户都还只是冰山一角。绝大多数的互联网用户都害困在传统社交网络中，让加密应用的热度扩散才是Web 3.0 走向主流用户的最关键一步。\n\n# 3. 理念的实际运用\n\n### 3.1 ENS\n\nENS”，全称 Ethereum Name Service， 是一个基于以太坊区块链的分布式，开放，可扩展的命名系统。简单来说，通过它可以把原本难以记忆的以太坊地址变成自定义的短地址。通过这种方式，人们可以轻易记下有关内容，既可以减少工作的繁琐程度，也可以减少不必要的风险。同时让用户可以通过以太坊账户和 ENS 配置文件控制自己的数字身份，不再依赖于传统的“中介”。\n\n**技术**\n\n这往往是在注册中心和解析器实现的：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KxP_2muLbCWAntIOITBtl.png?height=458&width=486)\n\nENS注册中心由一个智能合约组成，该合约维护所有域和子域的列表，并存储所有域和子域的三个关键信息：\n\n* 域的所有者\n* 域的解析器\n* 域下所有记录的缓存时间\n\nENS 注册中心作用很简单，只是为了从名称映射到负责它的解析器。解析器负责将名称转换为地址。任何有相关功能的合约都可以作为ENS中的解析器。\n\n在ENS中解析名称有两个步骤：首先，询问注册中心是哪个解析器负责该名称，其次，请该解析器回答查询。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/duhbK48dgxF77doKkPN3t.png?height=254&width=467)\n\n比如，我们试图找到\"foo. eth\"指向的以太坊地址。首先，我们询问注册中心哪个解析器负责“foo. eth”。然后，我们向解析器查询“foo. eth\"的地址。\n\n**数据**（截止至2022-05-23）\n\nDiscord关注：4万+\n\nTwitter关注：18.3万\n\n数据显示，以太坊域名服务商 ENS 在 5 月份以来的收入已经达到了 802 万美元，创下今年以来的新高。今年以来 ENS 已经累计获得了 4864 万美元的收入。\n\n**小结**\n\n通过运作流程可以看出来，整个过程并不会侵害用户的隐私，但是又为加密交易和地址记忆提供了便利条件。V神曾评论说：“ENS是迄今为止最成功的非金融类以太坊应用程序，基本可以类比为一个去中心化的电话册”。很明显它是前文所提到的 Desoc 的一个现实应用和技术支撑，随着行业的发展具有非常巨大的发展潜力。\n\n### 3.2 Bright ID\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wuZhsWQvRKNVOjwoLfTC_.png?height=609&width=1920)\n\nBrightID 是 Web3.0 用户的身份系统，基于以太坊开发，它是完全独立于传统和互联网身份认证的系统。一般用于DAPP用户验证；活动验证；信誉构建等。\n\n具有以下特点：\n\n无门槛：任何人都有权利拥有 Bright ID。\n\n隐私性：Bright ID 不会向用户索取或捕获任何个人隐私信息。\n\n开源：公共产品，完全免费且开源。\n\n**运作和验证方式**\n\nBrightID需要经过人脸和多人认证的方式来通过审核。认证结合链下会议视频等非隐私信息渠道的方式，采用视频会议的形式，由以上六位验证官负责主持验证会议并进行验证工作。验证会议的具体时间日历可在 BrightID 官网查看。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gp05mZ9Gx-tgYSiH2uGga.png?height=354&width=1280)\n\n**相关数据**\n\n融资信息\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BmJ3Z3sIoWc7xg5mA4WAk.png?height=70&width=514)\n\nMetaCartel 是一个由软件工程师、创业者以及以太坊爱好者构建的去中心化社区。他们在全球拥有600多名成员，他们具有丰富的领域经验和专业技能。已经为很多此领域最受欢迎的新兴项目提供了早期资金：Mintbase；Known Origin；Kickback；RocketNFT；Gelato Finance等。\n\n数据分析(截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注：13.2K\n\nAPP 融合：13款\n\nBright ID 用户：57K+\n\n**合作方：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySb7HH2E3tUyY-Zz9BFgX.png?height=471&width=1323)\n\n**小结**\nBrightID 在Web3.0时代扮演着很重要的角色，DAPP&APP、活动组织都采用 BrightID 进行身份验证。但这仅仅是 BrightID 潜力的一小部分，随着 BrightID 产品的迭代，以及其构建的信任网络不断扩大，将成就 BrightID 无限的可能性。\n\n### 3.3 MetaMask\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0n_GpHSQzK8HF-UjI7TT-.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nMetaMask，又或是人们口中常说的“小狐狸”钱包，日益成为加密圈内不可或缺的工具，你的钱包地址在一定程度上，可以代表你个人在链上的身份。\n\nMetaMask是一个通过web2互联网浏览器就能访问，且以低门槛与以太坊网络进行交互的工具钱包。它是Consensys目前面对终端用户的唯一产品，是以太坊最早的钱包之一，也是目前用户量最大的钱包。始于2015年，长期以网页端、免费、“半官方”的形态为大众所熟知，属于非托管型钱包。随着2020年Defi应用热潮与2021年NFT的火爆市场效应，MetaMask的用户量极速增长。2020年新增手机客户端和交易功能（名为Swap）。2021年5月推出MetaMask机构版，让机构用户能将MetaMask与机构级托管结合、方便工作流管理、易于汇报等。\n\n但起初，MetaMask其实并不是作为钱包插件之类的消费者项目，而是希望成为一种开发工具。Metamask母公司，是以太坊联合创始人Joseph Lubin所创办的区块链巨头公司之一的ConsenSys。ConsenSys 是以太坊重点项目的企业孵化器，旗下的MetaMask是ConsenSys布局的六大业务板块基础设施板块的重点项目。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YnjEZyE-akF8hkOslm1UO.png?height=188&width=839)\n\n**技术**\n\n现MetaMask已兼容绝大部分的区块链网络Dapp（包括Ethereum、Binance、Polygon），可集成托管解决方案来管理秘钥存储和多重签名批准。团队也在逐步优化产品本身，简化交易流程、减少交易费用、签字程序等。并逐步提升其合规能力，让钱包内可以进行高风险评估，安全进行去中心化和匿名交易等。\n对于大量的用户选择MetaMask作为迈入Web3的第一步，团队除了打磨好产品，提升钱包本身的安全性能，用户友好度之外。面对发展迅猛的加密货币行业，使用需求量的暴增与跨网络的需求都是不可忽视的问题。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pzMu5CxfcUo_ekJI1Ma9l.png?height=419&width=1445)\n\n**相关数据（截止到2022-05-23）**\n\n**Twitter关注**：75.4 K\n\n**融资情况**：2022-03-16，ConsenSys 完成4.5亿美元D轮融资，完成最新一轮融资后，ConsenSys的估值超过70亿美元，比2021年11月完成2亿美元C 轮融资时的估值增加一倍以上。ConsenSys首席执行官Joe Lubin在接受Decrypt采访时表示，MetaMask很快将推出DAO并发行代币。新的DAO并不会参与管理MetaMask，但将为MetaMask的更新提供资金。可见，MetaMask的资金储备是比较充足的。\n\n**其他数据**：\n\n根据公开数据，截止目前，MetaMask的月活跃用户已达到3000万。而巅峰时期的以太坊全网活跃地址也才只有 800 万左右。不难看出，Meta钱包的月活跃数量远超于此，也印证了MetaMask钱包现在已经成为了大量加密的首选。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZijDJTKGeNWtZC7Higmnt.png?height=804&width=1526)\n\n截止到2022年3月份，MetaMask插件的下载了超过1,000,000，目前日活跃用户大概在6k-8k左右，每日新用户超过2K+。目前加密货币钱包类用户早已超过8000万，对于一些出现的维护问题，团队已出现了棘手的情况。\n\n相较于互联网46亿的活跃用户来说，加密货币未来的将拥有更广阔的市场。目前MetaMask主要支持以太坊和各种EVM链，未来若想跨接到Solana等多生态，团队将如何开拓和维系其服务，值得期待。\n\n**小结**\n\n如今，MetaMask的使用已相当普及，这似乎已成为了进入Web3的第一步——生成你的去中心化钱包地址。而钱包也逐渐成为区块链世界中的一种身份象征，作为用户使用频率最高的小狐狸钱包，swap与NFT购买，是其最常用的两个功能。也因为以太坊生态中任何一个应用，都会支持MetaMask，两者的发展相辅相成，逐渐将钱包地址与Web3世界里去中心化个人身份的划上等号。\n未来，伴随着多链时代的到来，通用钱包的概念或将被逐渐被弱化，取而代之的可能是针对性更强的点对点产品服务，如专门的NFT钱包，打金钱包等。随着时间的推移，MetaMask自身以及新生代的钱包的发展都同样值得期待\n\n### 3.4 CyberConnect \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eXmS6-XLpYtKe3eZn9mQm.png?height=77&width=346)\n\nCyberconnect旨在解决社交图表（Social Graph）再分配问题，这个问题其实很好去解释，就是说Web2.0中各种平台的信息无法互通，造成重复资源浪费且难以找到各种志同道合的用户，社交图谱相对单一。\n\n而Cyberconnect所表明的内涵或者本质也很简单（用户之间的关系不仅仅是双向或者三向的，更是各种交叉和重叠的混合网络关系）例如A本身，与A关注的用户，和关注A的用户进行不同连线组合，形成一张独特的“图谱”，证明该用户的社交关系网，而从这些与用户A有联系的人又重新编织，又将形成新的图谱。这样网络世界中拥有相同的兴趣爱好的用户，同游戏玩家，商品贸易中的的买家卖家等通过社交图谱逐渐变得清晰。**如此一来，CyberConnect 便打破了不同平台之间的壁垒。**\n\n**技术**\n\n关于数据和存储：CyberConnect社交图数据存储时使用的IPFS和无许可协议Ceramic构建，联通Ceramic区块链锚定和自定义数据固定服务，可以保证CyberConnect链上数据长期存储。（使用Ceramic DID方法）关于用户数据在不同的平台如何集成，则需要采用Ceramic身份协议IDX，它为开发人员提供一个统一的界面，在CyberConnect内部查询这些数据分析，反过来CyberConnect也会给与DID链上系统提供更多的身份数据。\n\n与其它项目集成：同时CyberConnect还会与其它Web3项目集成获取信息，例如NFT平台Foundation与Rarible等，其实最重要的一点是让玩家通过一个统一的身份来参与不同种类的生态应用，同时也能与Web2链接使链上和链下数据结合起来成为更强大的去中心化数据提供商。\n\n**相关数据：**(数据截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注数：57,7k+\n\n生态项目数：30+\n\n入驻用户：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a7o2JaOaNfPgndwT2sSm3.png?height=108&width=679)\n\n融资消息：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MKRShXhLUbStaV7wGpQdV.png?height=127&width=685)\n\n其中的Multicoin曾投资过Near Protocol、Solana、Helium、Duna Analytics、Audius等潜力新兴区块链或者具有足够实际应用的优质Web3.0应用，此次Cyberconnect也正是该机构看好未来web3社交领域的潜力而开展的首次社交应用投资，证明该赛道的早期成长属性和该项目未来价值发掘。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgkZfhUF3wFkZo_i2RlCP.png?height=542&width=1145)\n\n**小结**\n\n社交化图标也是DID最核心应用场景之一。毕竟身份的重要程度随着社交功能完善等比例增长。虽然目前Cyberconnect已经接入Solana、Ethereum、Binance网络链，在用户体验感上来说，以太坊网络链是功能较完善且操作流畅，但部分操作功能在Solana上还处于开发阶段，不仅容易在网络上造成拥堵而且需要使用不同的钱包插件，使得用户体验感下降。\n\n作为一个去中心化的社交图谱协议，为Web3.0社会网络和元宇宙服务，CyberConnect还需要在前进的道路上完成更多的目标。\n\n### 3.5 Mirror\n\n提到去中心化的写作平台，大部分区块链用户都会脱口而出“Mirror”，其平台在成立不到一年就被联合广场风险投资公司估值1亿美元，获1千万美元投资。作为去中心化的写作平台赛道代表——Mirror 是依靠哪些去中心化特性和功能”荣登“宝座呢？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jylJj2d9u5m_YMYfOnvQA.png?height=601&width=865)\n\n**功能简介**\n\nMirror 跟中心化的写作平台最大的不同是，他具备加密区块链产品的特性和功能。参与用户无需通过邮箱账号，手机号码，社交帐户等中心化的身份验证手段来注册账号，只需要绑定自己的0x开头的钱包地址即可生成独一无二的“作者专栏”，类似于上文所提及的ENS（以太坊域名）。对于部分创作者来说，跟外界的接触仅仅由一串小小的字符连接，完美的融合了去中心化身份的理念。\n\n除此之外，创作者可以在Mirror平台上发布文章/创作图片等作品，每一件公开发布的作品不是保存在中心化服务器上，而是透过区块链存储专案Arweave进行链上的数据保存，经用户进行加密签名后生成一段哈希值记录，将作品永久的保存在区块链上。Mirror上更是支持创作者将自己的作品铸造成NFT，让原先没有边际成本、可被无限复制的内容作品具有稀缺性，从而被赋予价值。不仅无法被他人复制或修改，而且可以在各大NFT市场上进行售卖。\n\n其次，Mirror 也提供读者募资功能，读者喜欢的文章可以直接使用加密货币”打赏“创作者；共同的创作者可以按照设定好的盈利比例来获取各自部分的收益；以及其平台上的作品拍卖功能等等。\n\n**技术**\n\nMirror 在保存用户文章时使用的两类 Web3 组件，一个是用于对文章进行永久存储的 Arweave，另一个是用于对文章进行确权与交易的 NFT 铸造平台以太坊主网。\n\n1. Mirror 的存储组件-Arweave，是一条针对存储进行了底层性能优化的公链，因此用户在 Arweave 链上存储数据的成本相较其他智能合约公链平台有极大的降低。同时，链上存储的特征保证了在 Arweave 之上存储数据的永久性，因此，基于 Arweave 的存储模式也常被归类为永久存储。创作者在保存文章修改的时候，Mirror 会在后台自动对新的文章进行二次上链存储。\n2. Mirror 的确权组件，在存储的同时，通常会需要另一组 Web3 组件，以便对存储的内容进行确权，也就是将内容铸造为 NFT 格式的资产。但此步骤是在以太坊网络上以 NFT 的形式进行确权，成本由创作者自行承担支付。\n\n**相关数据（截至2022-05-23）**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sjq8tIDcdQka6SZ6w-cY3.png?height=71&width=699)\n\n**小结**\n\n去中心化创作平台-Mirror 的核心创新点很多，打破了传统创作平台的束缚，将NFT，社区DAO，Write-Fi相结合的经济模型，解决了部分去中心化平台所追求的“通过创作内容实现价值变现”的难题，相信 Mirror 这样肩负着去中心化任务的创作平台也会在迈向 WEB3.0 的道路上越走越远。\n\n### 3.6 Project Galaxy\n\nProject Galaxy 的愿景是想要打造一个最大的 Web3 数据凭证（credential data）网络，建造一个开放协作数据聚合基础设施，助力开发者和项目方建造更好的产品和社区。项目方在 Project Galaxy 平台上面为用户创建并奖励 NFT，用户完成项目方的任务，比如在链上进行特定的交互、参加会议、关注推特、加入 Discord 社区、提交问卷、参与测试等方式获得NFT。\n\n**技术：**\n\nProject Galaxy 目前支持两种方式来提供数据凭证 GraphQL 和 REST API。Galaxy上有两个角色，分别是数据贡献者和使用者。数据贡献者可以用子图查询或静态快照（subgraph queries or static snapshots）的方式贡献链上数据，同时在链下，Galaxy 也集成了信息来源，比如推特和 GitHub。\n\n数据使用者使用 Application module, Credential Oracle Engine, and Credential API 三种方式使用数据。并使用 Galaxy 的代币 $GAL 支付，因此数据贡献者可以获得激励。\n\n**相关数据**：\n\n已入驻项目方：400+\n\nGalaxy ID 用户：170 万+\n\nTwitter关注：30 万+\n\n融资情况：2021 年 5 月种子轮融资，2022年1月由 Multicoin Capital 和 Dragonfly Capital 领投、多个机构参投的 1000 万美元融资。随后 2 月在 CoinList 平台公募获得 1500 万美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gZN7tj9iV2lHWkssLK7Z3.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nProject Galaxy上线时间为2021年5月，运行不到一年，活跃用户量远大于同类型的项目 POAP 和 Rabbithole 。2021 年底银河女孩系列 NFT 活动让 Project Galaxy 一举成名，银河女孩 NFT 持有者更是获得了该项目原生代币 $GAL 在 CoinList 平台上公募的优先队列名额。后续 Meta Cowboy，Dr.SOL 等系列 NFT 持有者也获得了 $GAL 空投。\n\n**小结**\n\nProject Galaxy 无疑是一个非常成功的项目。链上身份凭证和数字身份一直都有市场需求，Project Galaxy 作为多链项目满足了市场在这方面的需求，为整个加密生态系统提供服务。在经历 Defi Summer 和 NFT Summer 之后 ，它抓住了 Crypto 项目方频繁使用 NFT 作为用户激励工具的需求。它给项目方提供了发放 NFT 奖励活动的工具和用户流量资源，初步形成了项目方和项目方之间，项目方和用户之间，用户和用户之间的多重网络效应。\n\n# 4. 新型社交的展望\n\n### 最初的载体与未来场景？\n\n绝大部分用户最熟悉DID理念实际运用应该是区块链钱包，例如Metamask是作为用户接入整个区块链的入口端，具有隐私性、安全性、不可追踪性。这是DID赛道最初应用成果，但是其缺点也很明确。钱包地址的注册缺少独特性，一个人可以注册大量毫无价值的钱包。其次大钱包只能显示代币难以展示NFT和参与证明等未来势必流行的资产，更不用说SBT所畅享的“无纸化”证明，这是钱包的局限性。第三钱包无法配置资产可编程属性，无法限制其他人查看钱包资产，从而导致黑客攻击情况发生。不过理念的实践是处于不断完善的过程。现在已经出现了可以展示NFT和参与证明（POA）的去中心化身份应用，还有隐私赛道对于钱包和其它DID应用进行代币隐私化、资产可视化等功能赋能等，预计不短时间内所有区块链赛道应用可以进行用户DID绑定，可记录用户等额抵押、合同签订、参与证明和哈希参数等不可篡改的数据，潜在提升单一用户DID价值\n\n从结构和理论上来阐述，有社交的地方更加注重身份特征，所以从根本属性上来说SocialFi就是实现该理念的最初赛道，只有用户们尝试并参与进来，才能够从本质上理解DID在区块链各赛道中重要程度，在未来去中心化社交领域当中，寻找相同理念思想的用户从而构建和谐关系，通过新兴匹配技术进行身份特征快速转移和整合，快速的梳理出用户兴趣爱好与社交圈，可以大程度的减少网络中诈骗行为，提高社交沟通交流效率。\n\n### 如何评估用户DID价值赋能？\n\n未来DID账号的价值根据其内部的资产总数和分配比例，如加密货币、NFT、参与证明等进行价值评估，以及个人身份信息验证，与其他用户之间互动，评论留言等进行附加属性评估。最后就是项目之间的筛选机制和会员资格评判，如拥有某些NFT或者证明的用户获得相应空投奖励、参与测试的资格等，这些都进一步的丰富了DID整体价值属性。\n\n对于目前市场来说，DID基础设施赛道仍未出现热点项目能引领该赛道的热潮，例如DeFi的火热是Uniswap带领的，GameFi的出圈前者与Axie有关，后者StepN再次引领，所以扩大潜在用户群体还需要落实到实际具体项目当中，单一可行的理念是无法吸引到足够的投资者的。\n\nDID赛道本身是没有主动生产价值的能力，创建了钱包地址不代表钱包有钱，但是从另一角度来说DID也是最能兼容区块链中所有领域的基础设施，其价值决定极大程度上基于与其它项目应用的兼容，毕竟DID属于后端程序，与个性化应用并不冲突。\n\n### 趋势预测\n\n在如今整体环境影响下，以NFT和GameFi赛道为首的炒作属性偏高的赛道整体估值下降较多，新用户和资金参与量明显下跌，而以Web 3.0等基础设施属性较强的底层架构融资情况增长。可以明确的是DID与SocialFi等赛道会长时间处于发展道路中，寻找相关实际应用和价值层次赋能，且随着未来涌入区块链赛道的用户会越来越多，下一个牛市用户数量可能会达到三到五倍的增幅，用户之间的社交属性和凭证需求会随着用户数等比例增长，所以目前早期部署该赛道，其未来潜力也是无法估量的。\n\n# 5. DID 与 SocialFi 发展过程中可能的挑战\n\nDID 赛道 和 SocialFi 目前处于早期探索阶段，有着巨大的发展前景，隐藏着许多仍未被发掘的机会，但同时也有着不少问题等待 Web3 建设者们去挑战：\n\n* 不可转让这一概念本身就存在着技术上的挑战，在限制或防止转移的需求和区块链生态系统之间有着难以跨越的障碍，因为目前来说，几乎所有的项目标准都是围绕着最大可转移性来设计的。\n* 隐私是此类生态系统良好运作的一个重要前提。许多情况下，用户并不希望透露他们所有的身份信息。去中心化的身份信息如何做到仅在必要的时候披露给必要的对象，也是在技术上所面临的一大挑战。\n\n一个只规范资本而不规范人类个人行为的制度可能只会无情地服务于金钱而非人类本身。我们作为 Web3 的参与者和建设者，需要更多的思考和更多的努力来解决这些挑战。而如果我们能够成功解决，则为区块链那些并非只关注金钱的生态系统，打开了一扇通往更为广阔天地的大门。\n\n## 参考资料\n\n1.

Initial coin offerings (ICOs) have developed as a new method for entrepreneurial finance, with parallels to initial public offerings, venture capital, and presale crowdfunding (Howell, Niessner & Yermack, 2020). Today, cryptocurrencies market capitalization hovers around 1.6 trillion dollars, and there are four main types of tokens: payment, utility, security, and non-fungible. Utility tokens are the most popular form today and serve as the media of exchange on the associated blockchain platform. At this point, cryptocurrencies would not need any further introduction. However, there is still widespread scepticism and a lack of comprehension of the fundamentals that underpin the value of tokens, especially utility tokens. This is largely because traditional security valuation techniques do not easily apply to their complex nature, and the overall crypto market has become notorious for its large price volatility, scams, jokes, and frauds.\n\nOver the last two years, Covid-19 triggered an enormous wave of retail investors with little to no expertise pursuing the opportunities of a bull cycle on stocks, as well as the crypto market. This social media-investing revolution has generated a lot of self-proclaimed investing and crypto gurus, which have made it easier for people to follow blindly and gamble money into the crypto market without prior due diligence. I do believe theirs some content creators out there who bring excellent “not financial advise” to the crypto-space and provide a thorough analysis to their viewers. But, this buzz has fueled a wave of getting-rich quick novice speculators rather than investors, and most cannot even explain what their crypto holdings even do.\n\nWhile speculation is not necessarily a vice, it is a short term game, and it can be very profitable during bull markets. However, it is unlikely to provide a lifetime of sustainable income or returns. Investors deciding on factual data plays a central role for healthy functioning markets, and better and widely adopted valuation methods will help the crypto-space to mature into one.\n\nRecently the market has stumbled, with Bitcoin around the $29,000 mark and many altcoins have double-digit drops. Phases of contraction and expansion of an emerging asset class are natural regardless of which page we turn in the calendar. I believe this is a great ‘cooldown’ period where projects are able to consolidate, and newcomers and speculators who got ‘reckt’ by trying to time the market to learn and reassess their strategies. For this reason, I thought it was a great time to start writing a three-part series to share a simple, not simpler due-diligence framework for valuing cryptos combining outstanding research papers on the field that I’ve scrutinised during my economics studies at the University of Queensland and my own takes on the subject.", "timestamp": 1653379606, "digest": "COtrR9MOhdz1JAWztYdcnlqUl4V6XGbF8wE2tRshYYE", "contributor": "0x56c79c0eaB20BAFa2A643509A07B1Ee09941e597"}

The month ended with 9.22 million active users and $34.37 million in transactions. However, compared to March, active users and transaction volume declined by 24.9 percent and 73.4 percent, respectively.\n\nDespite the decline in users and volume, some GameFi projects continued to perform well. For example, STEPN was the hottest DApp on the crypto market that month, Splinterlands ranked #1 in daily active users with a daily average of over 350,000, and DeFi Kingdoms surpassed Axie Infinity as the most traded GameFi project.\n\n## GameFi Market Overview\n\n### GameFi project count 5.2% YoY, growth concentrated in BSC and Polygon\n\nAccording to Footprint Analytics, as of April 30, 38 public chains have participated in the GameFi space, with 1,479 game projects, a 5.2% increase from the previous year.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Number of GameFi Protocols by Chains](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A1x2ratuDjawXPEYZXFy4.png?height=856&width=1640)\n\nEthereum's project count in the GameFi ecosystem is not growing as fast as on the BSC and Polygon chains. The projects on BSC and Polygon have become some of the more popular games in the crypto market today. They include Bomb Crypto and Mobox on BSC; Crazy Defense Heroes and Pegaxy on Polygon.\n\nDevelopers prefer BSC and Polygon games because of their low gas fees, high throughput, and high security on par with Ethereum. The number of projects on Ethereum is gradually divided by public chains such as BSC, Polygon and WAX, attracting a large number of game users and projects.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Monthly Number of Games by Chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oEi-Orz67J3BptHGJt9Go.png?height=471&width=922)\n\n### Active users down 24.9% YoY, GameFi's transaction volume down\n\nAs of April 30, the total number of active users was 9.22 million, of which 780,000 were new users. Compared to March, the number of active users decreased by 24.9%.\n\nSince October, the number of new and active users has declined, despite the increase in the number of games.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Monthly Gamers Trend](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vbx-bzf899hP_M-nis_Ca.png?height=755&width=1443)\n\nBut not all public chain games are unpopular; for example, the Polygon game ecosystem saw a 25% increase in new users, led by Crazy Defense Heroes and Pegaxy.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - GameFi New Users by Chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/W3OVWXC7UrTmBBcfyHu7M.png?height=572&width=1772)\n\nAccording to Footprint Analytics, trading volumes spiked from October to November, even exceeding $510 million in daily trading volume. However, since January, GameFi trading volume has been in a slump due to the macroeconomic impact. Per capita trading volume has gradually dropped from $105 to $20.\n\nIn addition, the Axie Infinity hack in mid-February significantly impacted active users and trading volume, which resulted in the loss of over $615 million in ETH and USDC to users.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - GameFi of Volume Trend](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S0-N2B2CU_lcYOnjPoZyt.png?height=717&width=1536)\n\n![Footprint Analytics - GameFi Volume and Transactions per User](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JnvWRkhU3NsqkXxKTY6y7.png?height=709&width=1541)\n\n### Nearly $2.4 billion raised in GameFi, up 381% YoY\n\nThe data shows that the overall blockchain space saw the largest amount of funding in April, with investments totaling $6.62 billion. the GameFi space accounted for 36.3% of the total investments, with $2.4 billion invested. Compared to March, GameFi grew by 381%.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Funding-Monthly Investment Trend](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NCyCo0RB8V7eU0CAHY0x2.png?height=768&width=1550)\n\nWeb3 has seen the largest investment in the investment space, with STEPN, a Web3 project that combines elements of GameFi and SocialFi, being the most notable project.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Gaming Financing Distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_OlOh_KTfT9RQkB9PAsr3.png?height=769&width=1511)\n\n### April GameFi data underperformed, but still had great projects\n\nWhile the macro trend was negative, several projects performed well in April. Splinterlands continued to rank #1 in daily active users for over three months, averaging over 350,000 daily. deFi Kingdoms surpassed Axie Infinity as the most traded GameFi project. And STEPN became the hottest DApp on the crypto market with Move to Earn.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Top 10 Games Ranking by Users (April 30)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zmYW8n4J9nJCfB48CMTbg.png?height=743&width=1743)\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Top 10 Games Ranking by Volume](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cna3aKb71yKzV3Ki3MxBN.png?height=759&width=1747)\n\n### Splinterlands holds the number one spot with 350,000 daily users\n\nSplinterlands, an NFT card game, has become the most popular program in the GameFi space. According to Footprint Analytics, the number of users and transactions is gradually increasing and stabilizing.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Splinterlands Users & Transactions](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JcKwTaUX_QdAA4tnvb4om.png?height=737&width=1761)\n\nSplinterlands has proven to be popular for its simple gameplay and low barrier to entry. And like Axie Infinity and other games, it uses a dual-currency model to stabilize the liquidity of in-game funds and minimize the impact of token price fluctuations in the secondary market on the game.\n\n### DeFi Kingdoms surpasses Axie Infinity as the most traded project\n\nAs of March 29, DFK has overtaken Axie Infinity as the most traded program. News of the attack on Axie Infinity, which was considered safe, shook users' confidence and trading volumes fell off. As a result, April will be a tough month for Axie Infinity, which will hopefully be able to restore user confidence in the game by recovering $5.8 million in funding and launching Axie Infinity Origin's new arena game mode on April 7.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Comparison of Users Axie Infinity and DeFi Kingdoms](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BSbV3grt0pTrZeb8zm0RE.png?height=744&width=1653)\n\n![Footprint Analytics - DeFi Kingdoms Monthly Retention Analysis](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/byeld7lza8BcQ324fgHuf.png?height=666&width=1911)\n\nAlthough DeFi Kingdoms has no VC funding, they maintain a monthly user retention rate and a solid daily user base through their own Tokenomics and the team's planning and advancement of the program.\n\n### STEPN becomes the most popular DApp\n\nSTEPN is the first successful Move-to-Earn game and has the real potential to become the long-awaited game that will bring GameFi into the mainstream.\n\nPlayers buy NFT sneakers and earn through in-game tokens. It further gamifies sports by creating a system of sneaker upgrades, such as walking, jogging or running.\n\nSTEPN has been online for less than 6 months and as of April 30, its market cap has surpassed $2 billion. Now that Axie Infinity has fallen short of new users, STEPN may even surpass Axie Infinity's $2.2 billion market cap.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Market Cap of STEPN and Axie Infinity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KiCtDgpopZ5dMBXXJZknC.png?height=763&width=1776)\n\nFootprint Analytics data shows that the price of token GMT rose from $0.16 to $3.52, an increase of 2100% in a short period of time.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Trading Volume vs Price of STEPN](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dGe5f6pw6Tey4v0ACM36r.png?height=751&width=1770)\n\nThere is no doubt that STEPN is currently one of the hot trends in the market.\n\n## Summary\n\nWhile GameFi was closely tied to macro trends, with overall transaction and user numbers declining overall, there was no stopping individual game projects from making a splash in April. STEPN grew rapidly, with DFK overtaking Axie Infinity as the most traded project and Splinterlands stabilizing its daily active user base.\n\nWelcome to join #NowhereDAO, a free information and token information sharing platform:  \n\n[https://discord.gg/JHXpb8KDzk](https://discord.gg/JHXpb8KDzk)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653379761, "digest": "OrPucadiHsJBZm-iGGrKTXI49gBhu6Cl6JunjCYBX3E", "contributor": "0xC16bf23A6E1282298467ED76AF912b9E9108431A"}

{"id": "3eclgVkvvNbpYaTtxszaRRuFVawrogwlUOTVRXrcgEc", "title": "Energy($NRG) - Under-collateralized Stablecoin", "body": "## Overview\n\nEnergy($NRG) is an under-collateralized algorithmic stablecoin of EntropyDAO. In order to ensure the circulation supply of $NRG can be steadily increased under-collateralized, and most of the $NRG holders can redeem their $NRG back into $USDC at 99% of the time, a series of mechanisms are mentioned below to realize this seemingly impossible target:\n\n* Mint & Redeem\n* BOND\n\nMint & Redeem provides a long-term stable primary market 1:1 exchange scenario. When the secondary market price is higher or lower than 1 USDC, arbitrageurs can always use the mechanism to equalize the exchange rate between the primary and secondary markets which keeps the $NRG price stable at 1 USDC for a long time. But where does the liquidity of the $NRG primary and secondary markets come from? To this end, EntropyDAO introduces the innovative $NRG BOND mechanism.\n\nInvestors who pursue low-risk and stable returns can buy $NRG Bond NFT in $USDC. EntropyDAO promises to return the principal (paid with $NRG) and certain interest (50%$NRG+50%$ENT) when Bond NFT reaches Maturity Dates. EntropyDAO uses 100% of the $USDC funds to add liquidity to the $NRG primary and secondary markets . At the same time, 50% of the promised interest ($NRG) is used to buy $ENT immediately from the secondary market and reserve it as the $ENT part of Bond interest which will be paid in the future.\n\nIn this way, EntropyDAO solve the following three problems through the Bond mechanism: Who is $NRG assigned to during expansion?\n\n* Low-risk appetite investors who are willing to buy long-term bonds to obtain stable returns. How to support the $NRG redemption problem in an under-collateralized situation?\n* Investors who purchase long-term bonds will pay cash to the protocol to supplement the existing liquidity and obtain the rights and benefits of earning new stablecoins in the future. How will the added interest (currency) be paid in the long run?\n* By buying $ENT from the secondary market, the protocol continuously adds 50% of the freshly minted stablecoin($NRG) into the $ENT secondary market, attracting more high-risk appetite investors to invest and stake $ENT through the price mechanism. More investors choose to hold and stake $NRG, ensuring that the $NRG circulating in the market can still have enough collateral for short-term redemption, forming a positive cycle.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HE-l7vECKYRJg_CkNJZVX.png?height=624&width=1218)\n\n## Mint & Redeem\n\n$USDC (and some ETH as the gas fee) is the only thing needed to mint a $NRG. There is no tax fee for mint action so $NRG could be minted by $USDC 1:1 without any limit. After that, all the $USDC will be stored in “Energy Reserve”  for redemption.\n\n**Why hold $NRG and what can it do?** $NRG will host the stability and payment functions of the EntropyDAO protocol. Governance token Entropy($ENT) will be priced by $NRG and LP BOND of $ENT will only be purchased by $NRG too. Besides, more infrastructure for $NRG will be introduced into EntropyDAO in 2022 Q3 and Q4. For example, the Marketplace of $NRG BOND will launch for swapping $NRG BOND NFT and use $NRG as the payment medium.\n\n**There is also no limit to redeem the $NRG.** $NRG can always be exchanged for $USDC on Uniswap v2, or at a 1:1 ratio through redemption to $USDC.\n\nPS: For the initial launch of EntropyDAO, only $USDC will be the collateral token.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fzsG9ldsT4PJ_6y_gb1ql.png?height=672&width=1088)\n\n## Bond\n\nThe Bond mechanism of OlympusDAO is definitely one of the most impressive designs in 2021. It not only solves the problem of who(users) and why(bond discounts) provide the liquidity, but also the concept of protocol owned liquidity (POL) was introduced to solve the death spiral problem of the previous LP farm module when the token price fell. However, it doesn't mean their designs are 100% perfect. Users still have to add the LP by themselves through a series of complicated processes which makes it not user-friendly enough. Also, the formula of Bond discount is hard for the public to understand.\n\nBased on OHM’s excellent LP bond design, some adjustments will be added to EntropyDAO：\n\n1. **Pay only with $USDC**: Investors only need $USDC instead of creating LP tokens to buy the $NRG bond NFT\n2. **BOND NFT**: Investors will receive a Bond NFT after payment, it will record bond terms like when and how much they buy. All of the principles and 50% of the interest, which is called the $NRG Face value in total, will be paid by $NRG. And the remaining 50% of the interest will be swapped into $ENT from $NRG immediately based on the market price and stored on contracts until the bond NFT matures.The $ENT amount that the user will get is the $ENT Face value.\n3. **Maturity Date:** After the bond reaches its maturity date, investors can use Bond NFT to claim the principal and interest back.\n4. **Protocol Owned Liquidity(POL):** Half of the $USDC investors provide will be used to mint $NRG automatically, and then all these $NRG will be added into the liquidity of $NRG-$USDC with the remaining half of $USDC by contracts.\n5. **Long-term & Low-risk:** As half interest will be paid directly by $NRG, it will give the Bond NFT a long-term stable value and reduce the risk for users to hold it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R7RFEz_J0xPXH91TaX0NF.png?height=648&width=1500)\n\n## Expansion and Contraction\n\nBased on the Overview part, the freshly issued $NRG is distributed to $NRG Bond NFT holders. Some key indicators need to be introduced here to measure the expansion condition and quota. Besides that, contraction of $NRG based on certain conditions is also considered in EntropyDAO.\n\n### Short-term Supply (S0)\n\nShort-term Supply is an indicator to measure the $NRG supply which will be circulated on the market in the short-term (less than 7 days). 100% of the supply provided as liquidity of NRG-USDC LP ( SN ) and 70%(TBD) of the supply provided as liquidity of ENT-NRG LP ( SE) are regarded as stable enough and will not be redeemed in the short term. Also, for different vesting term of $NRG bond, (Ti-7) / Ti of the bond debts are regarded to be paid in a short time. Thus, the Short-term Supply (S0) of $NRG is calculated as below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/h04l1vDtEHhmHY0dAofC4.png?height=75&width=495)\n\n* **S0** is the Short-term Supply of $NRG\n* ***St*** is the total supply of $NRG\n* ***Sn*** is the supply of $NRG provided as liquidity to NRG-USDC LP on a DEX (Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc.)\n* ***Se*** is the supply of $NRG provided as liquidity to ENT-NRG LP on a DEX (Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc.)\n* ***Bi*** is the total bond debts based on the different vesting term i\n* **Ti** is the vesting term (days) of different bonds.\n\n### Current Ratio\n\nThe current ratio is a general indicator of the business's ability to meet its short-term financial commitments. For EntropyDAO, the current ratio is defined as the indicator of the protocol’s ability to meet its short-term supply.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zLnXYyMg2NkuqA7z11_oO.png?height=77&width=581)\n\n* ***Ct*** is the total collateral stored by EntropyDAO, including the $USDC stored on $NRG Reserve and provided as liquidity on NRG-USDC LP\n* ***S0*** is the Short-term Supply of $NRG\n\n### Expansion\n\nEvery 8 hours, EntropyDAO checks the levels of the Current Ratio and decides whether to expand the supplies of $NRG. The freshly issued $NRG will not be distributed directly to any address but allocated to different vesting term bonds in the form of new quotas of $NRG BOND. Besides, only if the remaining quota of each bond is lower than 10%, the expansion of the $NRG bond quota will succeed.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J2Xs-qxjvMTWZSw2Fx7xI.png?height=204&width=612)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ys5F0b_VZp98lBgu1Rlt4.png?height=157&width=628)\n\n### Contraction\n\nUnlike expansion, EntropyDAO doesn't directly contract the supply of $NRG, but increases the market demand for $NRG by burning the reserve of $ENT. Every 8 hours, EntropyDAO will check the current ratio level, and use the $NRG accumulated by $ENT BOND to complete the contraction mechanism through buying $ENT by $NRG and burning $ENT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vhiH9WZPuQF4rBCK5Vd3A.png?height=199&width=609)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DFt683_bwbMwbc34vKn5E.png?height=273&width=705)\n\n### Updated in Future\n\nIn the EntropyDAO roadmap, the Bond expansion smart contracts will totally be held and managed by the DAO which is not only for a few managers but for all gENT holders. Actually, the indicators and formulas presented above still have the space to be better. Thus, EntropyDAO decides to list all the key parameters of Bond expansion indicators for $gENT holders to vote for adjustment. There is no doubt that the more people truly understand and participate in the EntropyDAO, the more possibility that it can be an actual evolving protocol.", "timestamp": 1653381515, "digest": "-LXKaV_rmqTLEcOyDyvV7dY7WE0HHGhsidENRqe71CE", "contributor": "0xD19C8FF9aFba9cC3c69E1251240dA1805123E44b"}

{"id": "GanUmQ9fdcAPhvPx7IUEnTqgOFulBAEhf52oYL4RBUs", "title": "Create a new chain for Web3 Application?", "body": "**Web3 Meetup**\n\nI remember at the end of 2018, my companions and I organized blockchain technology workshop meetup, I invited *Louis Liu* to speak to the community partners about the future trend of Crypto, because he wrote a lot of in-depth articles to introduce Crypto and preach the new technology trend and business logic, I read all his articles and decided to invite him to our event,  he came to Wanxiang's conference and he prepared very detailed materials to explain what web3 is to the partners who attended the meetup, and he predicted that the application chain might explode in the future, and later he slowly enriched his theory and focused on cross-chain and application chain development, and finally established the Near-based [OctopusNetwork](https://oct.network/).\n\n**Application Chain**\n\nWhy do I bring up this story? Because our discussion about application chains at that time slowly turned into a real story, as we all know [AXIE](https://axieinfinity.com/) created its own new chain Robin, and [Defi Kingdoms](https://defikingdoms.com/) on [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) also recently announced a partnership with [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) to launch [DFKchain](https://docs.defikingdoms.com/how-defi-kingdoms-works/defi-kingdoms-blockchain) , which I understand as DFKchain equivalent to Avalanche’s sidechain or parallel chain, but in any case they have launched their own chain, and I predict that many applications will consider this option in the future.\n\n**Create your own public chain**\n\nI made a comment in the [Stepn](https://stepn.com/) community three days ago that I think they should also consider creating their own public chain that fits their product requirement. [Stepn](https://stepn.com/) is a project I really like because I'm a sports fan and have join half marathons events many times. As a participant in the Crypto space, I also expected some great Web3 apps to appear in Crypto industry. **Stepn** was on my watch list at the end of '21 when my friend  mentioned it in one talk show and I accessed their website to check out project information. I was a fans of ***Mable Jiang's podcast***, and later,  I learned the story of the two founders of Stepn on her podcast, which was very, very important for me to understand **Stepn**. Since then I've been following the project's development, becoming a loyal Stepn runner and participating in community discussions.\n\n**Uncritical thinking**\n\nWhen I tried to do an internal transfer after my run 3 days ago, the whole transfer process took 2 hours. This is not the first time this kind of problem happened, and users of Stepn community also faced this trouble long time, and I know that the reason why the chain transfer is full is caused by Solana's network problem. I also consulted with solana engineers about this problem, but there is no good solution.That's why I made a statement in the **Stepn community** that the team need to consider creating their own public chain, and the reasons for developing a new public chain are basically the same as **AXIE** and **DFK**. \n\n***Last night when I finished my activation with stepn, I suddenly remembered the discussion about application chains of meetup in 2018, and I realized that my previous statements in the stepn community were very inappropriate, and now my opinion is Web3 applications should not be urgent to create their own public chains.***\n\n**Why**\n\nThe question of whether Web3 applications should create their own public chains should be discussed in two ways：\n\n1. **Whether the existing public chains can no longer meet the requirements of the application?** Further, the team can determine whether the current public chain will not be able to meet the requirements of the application in the future as well? The usual view is that application chains are faster, lower gas cost, and low cost for users to use, which is a big reason for **AXIE** to leave ETH. Another reason is that it is highly customizable, all parameters can be adjusted, you can modify the execution environment, modify the wallet, the community own on-chain governance, or you can  reach consensus, upgrade the protocol, quickly evolve to adapt to new requirements, or troubleshoot software bugs, etc..For example, Axie Infinity, which has seen an explosion since it went live with its own custom ethereum strategy in April '21 because it reduced transaction costs by several orders of magnitude,and integrated fiat payments in the wallet, that making an explosion of whole protocol , which is the advantage of developing new public chains.\n2. **There is another important question for the team to think about, does the team have the ability to design a more perfect chain**? we know that ETH, Solana, or even certain ZK-rollup projects which  still face scalability issues, speed issues, decentralization issues, security issues now, but they can  solve these pain points  in a short time? Fork and Copy code ,modify parameters，it looks easy to develop a new chain, but running up a public chain that takes a long time and requires huge investment. So creating a new public chain you will still face the same problems in this industry, and the best way to solve the TPS  is to be highly centralized, but this also means a high risk, easy to be manipulated and other problems. Some time ago, we all know that AXIE was attacked. Although Flow and IMX are exploring this direction, it is still difficult to solve the above problems, and now all Layer 1 public chains are trying to solve these problems.\n\n**What to do?**\n\nWaiting and keep attention, keep learning, optimize the speed problem by other methods, such as cross-chain, share part of the pressure to other chains. waiting for the application chain infrastructure to mature and then deploy the product to these chains, such as Defi Kingdoms' attempt on AVAX, or wait for the maturity of Layer2 zk-rollup technology or you can try to based on multi-chain services like *OctopusNetwork*, rather than taking the risk to create new public chain.", "timestamp": 1653381561, "digest": "IYbI_4zMCkV2TclEYPsf1FHiRyK2h95RjcqBhxTt8hU", "contributor": "0xD033feF6d4C75CE2F4878314057C2F959FAB4679"}
{"id": "II3KgxLD_ETC0raeMRPxc9hnMOPxqrLJZgA7vjI3IEI", "title": "DID 与 SocialFi 将走的路：找寻 Web3 的灵魂", "body": "> 作者：Diamond, Diane, Maxwell, Evelyn, Carole, Claire\n> Twitter: <https://twitter.com/D_TigerResearch>\n> Discord: <https://discord.gg/CZCM7WesKS>\n\n## 1. Vitalik 等论文摘要\n\n《去中心化社会：找寻 Web3 的灵魂》是 Vitalik 等人联合发表的最新论文，本文讲述了如何通过 “灵魂绑定” Token（本质上来说就是 DID）来建立一个更加多元、丰富的 Desoc（去中心化社会）。论文内容非常长，本文将对这篇论文的重要观点进行转述与总结，这样读者很快就能了解去中心化社会有关知识了。\n\n### 1.1 Web3成立之初的局限性\n\n在不到十年的时间里，Web3 创造了一个庞大的金融帝国，这一成就令世界瞩目，连 facebook 都以 all in 的形式参与到这场金融盛宴之中。加密和经济领域的基础元素，为金融交易带来了一个丰富、开放且多元的生态系统。但是这个过程中出现了一个矛盾，金融交易的经济价值是由人们现实生活中的社会关系等决定的，也就是说它的内部运转逻辑并不完善甚至可以说并不完整。正是由于 Web3 缺乏代表社会身份的基础元素，它从根本上依赖于它所要超越的中心化的 Web2 结构，这具有非常大的局限性。\n\n这种依赖性在具体应用方面也有很明显的体现：\n\n* 虽然 NFT 通过 Opensea 等去中心化平台进行交易，但是许多 NFT 艺术家会通过 Twitter 等中心化平台进行宣传，以向人们证明其真实性并达到推广的目的\n* 各种去中心化项目经常依赖 Web2 基础设施来实施投票\n* 许多 Web3 参与者依赖 Coinbase 或 Binance 等中心化实体管理的托管钱包\n\n此外由于缺乏原生的 Web3 身份，今天的 DeFi 生态系统无法支持实体经济中普遍存在的活动，如等额抵押贷款甚至超低额抵押贷款（目前加密贷款平台一般只支持超额抵押）或者签订公寓租赁等合同。在此我们试图通过“灵魂绑定”的 Token（“soulbound” tokens，SBTs，也就是 DID 去中心化身份）来打破这些局限。除此以外通过 Web3 社会身份，还可以就财富集中和金融攻击的治理脆弱性等更广泛的长期问题上取得巨大进展，同时刺激 web3 的政治、经济和社会应用的大幅发展。我们把这些用例和它们所促成的更丰富的多元生态系统称为“去中心化社会”（DeSoc）。**本文第二部分会就 web2 的社交与 Desoc 进行对比进一步展示出 Desoc 的一些特点与优势。**\n\n### 1.2 Desoc 的要素与畅想\n\n首先我们应先了解一下 DeSoc 的基本元素，它（“灵魂绑定” Token, SBTs） 围绕着人们持有的不可转让的账户（或钱包），代表着承诺、证书和关系，这种 Token 就像一份扩展的简历。可以简单地把这种东西理解为我们的身份证，有了身份证我们就可以缴纳社保、绑定银行卡等。没有身份证或者说法律认可的身份这些都很难实现，而目前的 web3 就处在这种没有身份证明的困局当中。在这里把起身份证明的东西被称为“灵魂”， 将账户持有的 Token 称为“灵魂 Token”（SBTs）。\n\n想象一下这样一个世界，大多数参与者都有“灵魂 Token”，它对应一系列的关系、会员资格和证书。因此人们不用公开自己的真实身份，就可以让他人看到自己的教育证书，就业历史，或自己的著作或艺术作品的一串哈希值，这种 Token 对相关信息的公开类似于人们在简历中分享关于自己的信息。更重要的是，通过这种身份人们可以互相识别，甚至可以实现目前无法达到的等额抵押、合同签订等。人们甚至可以无纸化，因为数据可以记录一切，并且因为它不可篡改的特点，又让一切变得更加可信。在这些技术的支持下 web3 一定会越来越丰富且美好。\n\n### 1.3 相关实例\n\n**艺术与“灵魂”**\n\n艺术家可以通过“灵魂”将作品与自己连接。当发行可交易的 NFT 时，艺术家可以从他们的“灵魂”中发行 NFT。艺术家的“灵魂”携带的 SBTs 越多，买家就越容易识别出“灵魂”是属于该艺术家的，从而也就能确定 NFT 的真实性。艺术家可以更进一步，在他们的“灵魂”中发布一个链接的 SBTs，证明某个 NFT 是该“系列藏品”的成员。因此，“灵魂”将创造一种可靠的、链上的交易和识别方式。 很明显，它的现实应用还有很多，NFT 艺术家的例子只是其中最具有代表性的。实际上，除了 web3 领域外，它也能有解决一些现实问题，比如知识产权、司法文件真伪判断等。毕竟随着深度造假技术的进步，人类和算法的直接检查将越来越无法检测真实性。虽然区块链的加入使我们能够追踪特定作品的制作时间，但 SBTs 将使我们能够追踪相关内容的社会出处，为我们提供丰富的社会背景，让我们了解发布作品的人的“灵魂”——他们的会员资格、关系、证书的组合。通过这种方式“高仿”可以很容易地被识别出来。\n\n**“灵魂”空投**\n\n在具体说明“灵魂”空投之前我们需要明白空投是什么，以及空投的意义到底是什么？区块链领域的空投是一种将数字货币通过区块链技术大规模分发到一些已有的数字货币钱包上的行为，比如以太币、比特币、EOS.IO 钱包。简单来说就是向广大网友“发钱”的过程。\n\n当面对空投人们会有四种行为：（1）上网搜索相关内容（2）和朋友聊相关内容，使朋友知晓有关信息（3）之前或者之后疯狂注册账号，以获得空投（4）直接无视\n\n空投本身是一种非常流行的营销策略，并不是所谓的“慈善”，因此在上述几种情况中，（3）和（4）属于无效空投，并不能带来实际的收益或者说宣传的效果。而其中的第三条属于危害性最大的一条，也就是常说的女巫攻击。为了避免第三条项目方往往设立许多空投限制，但是很明显并不能完全避免。通过 DID 可以有效解决上述问题，因为项目方可以依据 DID 进行空投，可以有效提高投放的精准性和准确性。\n\n论文中的相关例子还有很多这里就不多做列举了，如果感兴趣可以点击[论文原文](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763)进行细致了解。\n\n很显然，上文那两个所谓的相关实例都还是比较理想化的概念。**本文将于第三部分举出一些现有的比较具有代表性的相关去中心化项目，各位读者可以通过这些例子对相关内容予以把握。同时会在第四部分就上文提到的 DID 的使用、价值和发展前景进行详细的说明。**\n\n### 1.4 结论\n\n通过这篇文章大家可以预见到 Desoc 的美好未来，但同时也需要意识到 DID 只是这一远大历程中的一小步。此外，上面描述的场景只是 DeSoc 对现有项目与应用的强化作用，但是并没有涉及对比如物理、政治、社会以及它们与现实世界的复杂关系的描述，而它们实际上占据了我们现实生活的很大比例。所有这些都表明，上面描绘的远大理想，可能只是 DeSoc 最终形态的“雏形”。**论文中就 SBTs 的威胁与挑战也进行了比较细致的描述，在本文的第五部分将结合现实情况进行细致描写这里就不再细说。**\n\n# 2.  新型社交为何悄然而至\n\n### 2.1 Web2.0 传统社交弊病\n\nWeb2.0本质是平台经济，是以一小撮为代表的垄断性寡头构架，互联网在该阶段变成全民级别应用，聚集了社交、搜索、电商等超级生态应用开发，且每个行业领域龙头公司几乎垄断行业资源和发展上限，这使得Web2公司在拥有最终解释权的情况下去剥削和占有用户资源信息时游刃有余，例如微信和QQ在中国产生的影响力和不可置换性，使得用户无法维护本身利益，用户在Web2.0中更像是平台的附庸而不是服务接收者。而Web3.0是属于Token经济的后端程序革命，其本意是在为非平台内部的生态参与者获取更多的话语权和创造权，并拥有产品本身的价值支配权利，以及隐私性和安全性。一定程度的避免了不平衡的垄断机制。\n\n### 2.2 SocialFi 是 Web3.0 的必要组件\n\nSocialFi的出现是对抗传统社交平台弊端的必要产物，Web2.0 时代的社交平台被各大运营巨头控制，从用户数据中获取商业价值，忽略用户的感受。SocialFi基于区块链技术，用户身份信息的匿名性有助于保护隐私和安全，更有利于解决用户数据的确认问题以及权利下放。\n\n相信随着用户对于隐私以及自由的追求，越来越多的人会投身于Web3.0的世界，在用户渴望加密技术带给的数据主权时也渴望获得自己在这个世界独特的身份和地位。在Web2.0-3.0过渡的过程中，互联网用户需要一些中间件来从简单迁移到复杂，从而从原始空间迁移到元空间。元空间的实现需要从现有的互联网世界出发，利用一系列的Web3.0组件，分批分阶段的迎接新的用户。在尝试了Defi的去中心化资产流、NFT的数字工作价值、发现Gamefi的P2E之后，去中心化的意见发布和个人展示已经下一个需要探索和开发的Web3.0组件，在互联网发展历史中可以发现社交化可以说是网民的刚性需求。\n\n### 2.3 线上数据分析\n\n根据[Zippa](https://www.zippia.com/advice/cryptocurrency-statistics/)的统计以及交易平台和钱包的来源，2018-2020 年全球加密货币用户群增加了近 190%，2021 年进一步加速。 数据的增加可能是由于账户数量的增加以及身份识别的改进，以及在 2021 年特斯拉和万事达卡等公司宣布进军加密货世界等从热度上升带来的用户数量造成的。下图展示了Web3.0近几年来的趋势变化：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jov7Glf5pfabWlpkN1DD0.png?height=482&width=1141)\n\n根据Google Search数据统计，如今的互联网 2.0 使用用户约在 49.5 亿人左右，对标3亿的加密用户都还只是冰山一角。绝大多数的互联网用户都害困在传统社交网络中，让加密应用的热度扩散才是Web 3.0 走向主流用户的最关键一步。\n\n# 3. 理念的实际运用\n\n### 3.1 ENS\n\nENS”，全称 Ethereum Name Service， 是一个基于以太坊区块链的分布式，开放，可扩展的命名系统。简单来说，通过它可以把原本难以记忆的以太坊地址变成自定义的短地址。通过这种方式，人们可以轻易记下有关内容，既可以减少工作的繁琐程度，也可以减少不必要的风险。同时让用户可以通过以太坊账户和 ENS 配置文件控制自己的数字身份，不再依赖于传统的“中介”。\n\n**技术**\n\n这往往是在注册中心和解析器实现的：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KxP_2muLbCWAntIOITBtl.png?height=458&width=486)\n\nENS注册中心由一个智能合约组成，该合约维护所有域和子域的列表，并存储所有域和子域的三个关键信息：\n\n* 域的所有者\n* 域的解析器\n* 域下所有记录的缓存时间\n\nENS 注册中心作用很简单，只是为了从名称映射到负责它的解析器。解析器负责将名称转换为地址。任何有相关功能的合约都可以作为ENS中的解析器。\n\n在ENS中解析名称有两个步骤：首先，询问注册中心是哪个解析器负责该名称，其次，请该解析器回答查询。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/duhbK48dgxF77doKkPN3t.png?height=254&width=467)\n\n比如，我们试图找到\"foo. eth\"指向的以太坊地址。首先，我们询问注册中心哪个解析器负责“foo. eth”。然后，我们向解析器查询“foo. eth\"的地址。\n\n**数据**（截止至2022-05-23）\n\nDiscord关注：4万+\n\nTwitter关注：18.3万\n\n数据显示，以太坊域名服务商 ENS 在 5 月份以来的收入已经达到了 802 万美元，创下今年以来的新高。今年以来 ENS 已经累计获得了 4864 万美元的收入。\n\n**小结**\n\n通过运作流程可以看出来，整个过程并不会侵害用户的隐私，但是又为加密交易和地址记忆提供了便利条件。V神曾评论说：“ENS是迄今为止最成功的非金融类以太坊应用程序，基本可以类比为一个去中心化的电话册”。很明显它是前文所提到的 Desoc 的一个现实应用和技术支撑，随着行业的发展具有非常巨大的发展潜力。\n\n### 3.2 Bright ID\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wuZhsWQvRKNVOjwoLfTC_.png?height=609&width=1920)\n\nBrightID 是 Web3.0 用户的身份系统，基于以太坊开发，它是完全独立于传统和互联网身份认证的系统。一般用于DAPP用户验证；活动验证；信誉构建等。\n\n具有以下特点：\n\n无门槛：任何人都有权利拥有 Bright ID。\n\n隐私性：Bright ID 不会向用户索取或捕获任何个人隐私信息。\n\n开源：公共产品，完全免费且开源。\n\n**运作和验证方式**\n\nBrightID需要经过人脸和多人认证的方式来通过审核。认证结合链下会议视频等非隐私信息渠道的方式，采用视频会议的形式，由以上六位验证官负责主持验证会议并进行验证工作。验证会议的具体时间日历可在 BrightID 官网查看。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gp05mZ9Gx-tgYSiH2uGga.png?height=354&width=1280)\n\n**相关数据**\n\n融资信息\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BmJ3Z3sIoWc7xg5mA4WAk.png?height=70&width=514)\n\nMetaCartel 是一个由软件工程师、创业者以及以太坊爱好者构建的去中心化社区。他们在全球拥有600多名成员，他们具有丰富的领域经验和专业技能。已经为很多此领域最受欢迎的新兴项目提供了早期资金：Mintbase；Known Origin；Kickback；RocketNFT；Gelato Finance等。\n\n数据分析(截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注：13.2K\n\nAPP 融合：13款\n\nBright ID 用户：57K+\n\n**合作方：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySb7HH2E3tUyY-Zz9BFgX.png?height=471&width=1323)\n\n**小结**\nBrightID 在Web3.0时代扮演着很重要的角色，DAPP&APP、活动组织都采用 BrightID 进行身份验证。但这仅仅是 BrightID 潜力的一小部分，随着 BrightID 产品的迭代，以及其构建的信任网络不断扩大，将成就 BrightID 无限的可能性。\n\n### 3.3 MetaMask\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0n_GpHSQzK8HF-UjI7TT-.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nMetaMask，又或是人们口中常说的“小狐狸”钱包，日益成为加密圈内不可或缺的工具，你的钱包地址在一定程度上，可以代表你个人在链上的身份。\n\nMetaMask是一个通过web2互联网浏览器就能访问，且以低门槛与以太坊网络进行交互的工具钱包。它是Consensys目前面对终端用户的唯一产品，是以太坊最早的钱包之一，也是目前用户量最大的钱包。始于2015年，长期以网页端、免费、“半官方”的形态为大众所熟知，属于非托管型钱包。随着2020年Defi应用热潮与2021年NFT的火爆市场效应，MetaMask的用户量极速增长。2020年新增手机客户端和交易功能（名为Swap）。2021年5月推出MetaMask机构版，让机构用户能将MetaMask与机构级托管结合、方便工作流管理、易于汇报等。\n\n但起初，MetaMask其实并不是作为钱包插件之类的消费者项目，而是希望成为一种开发工具。Metamask母公司，是以太坊联合创始人Joseph Lubin所创办的区块链巨头公司之一的ConsenSys。ConsenSys 是以太坊重点项目的企业孵化器，旗下的MetaMask是ConsenSys布局的六大业务板块基础设施板块的重点项目。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YnjEZyE-akF8hkOslm1UO.png?height=188&width=839)\n\n**技术**\n\n现MetaMask已兼容绝大部分的区块链网络Dapp（包括Ethereum、Binance、Polygon），可集成托管解决方案来管理秘钥存储和多重签名批准。团队也在逐步优化产品本身，简化交易流程、减少交易费用、签字程序等。并逐步提升其合规能力，让钱包内可以进行高风险评估，安全进行去中心化和匿名交易等。\n对于大量的用户选择MetaMask作为迈入Web3的第一步，团队除了打磨好产品，提升钱包本身的安全性能，用户友好度之外。面对发展迅猛的加密货币行业，使用需求量的暴增与跨网络的需求都是不可忽视的问题。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pzMu5CxfcUo_ekJI1Ma9l.png?height=419&width=1445)\n\n**相关数据（截止到2022-05-23）**\n\n**Twitter关注**：75.4 K\n\n**融资情况**：2022-03-16，ConsenSys 完成4.5亿美元D轮融资，完成最新一轮融资后，ConsenSys的估值超过70亿美元，比2021年11月完成2亿美元C 轮融资时的估值增加一倍以上。ConsenSys首席执行官Joe Lubin在接受Decrypt采访时表示，MetaMask很快将推出DAO并发行代币。新的DAO并不会参与管理MetaMask，但将为MetaMask的更新提供资金。可见，MetaMask的资金储备是比较充足的。\n\n**其他数据**：\n\n根据公开数据，截止目前，MetaMask的月活跃用户已达到3000万。而巅峰时期的以太坊全网活跃地址也才只有 800 万左右。不难看出，Meta钱包的月活跃数量远超于此，也印证了MetaMask钱包现在已经成为了大量加密的首选。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZijDJTKGeNWtZC7Higmnt.png?height=804&width=1526)\n\n截止到2022年3月份，MetaMask插件的下载了超过1,000,000，目前日活跃用户大概在6k-8k左右，每日新用户超过2K+。目前加密货币钱包类用户早已超过8000万，对于一些出现的维护问题，团队已出现了棘手的情况。\n\n相较于互联网46亿的活跃用户来说，加密货币未来的将拥有更广阔的市场。目前MetaMask主要支持以太坊和各种EVM链，未来若想跨接到Solana等多生态，团队将如何开拓和维系其服务，值得期待。\n\n**小结**\n\n如今，MetaMask的使用已相当普及，这似乎已成为了进入Web3的第一步——生成你的去中心化钱包地址。而钱包也逐渐成为区块链世界中的一种身份象征，作为用户使用频率最高的小狐狸钱包，swap与NFT购买，是其最常用的两个功能。也因为以太坊生态中任何一个应用，都会支持MetaMask，两者的发展相辅相成，逐渐将钱包地址与Web3世界里去中心化个人身份的划上等号。\n未来，伴随着多链时代的到来，通用钱包的概念或将被逐渐被弱化，取而代之的可能是针对性更强的点对点产品服务，如专门的NFT钱包，打金钱包等。随着时间的推移，MetaMask自身以及新生代的钱包的发展都同样值得期待\n\n### 3.4 CyberConnect\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eXmS6-XLpYtKe3eZn9mQm.png?height=77&width=346)\n\nCyberconnect旨在解决社交图表（Social Graph）再分配问题，这个问题其实很好去解释，就是说Web2.0中各种平台的信息无法互通，造成重复资源浪费且难以找到各种志同道合的用户，社交图谱相对单一。\n\n而Cyberconnect所表明的内涵或者本质也很简单（用户之间的关系不仅仅是双向或者三向的，更是各种交叉和重叠的混合网络关系）例如A本身，与A关注的用户，和关注A的用户进行不同连线组合，形成一张独特的“图谱”，证明该用户的社交关系网，而从这些与用户A有联系的人又重新编织，又将形成新的图谱。这样网络世界中拥有相同的兴趣爱好的用户，同游戏玩家，商品贸易中的的买家卖家等通过社交图谱逐渐变得清晰。**如此一来，CyberConnect 便打破了不同平台之间的壁垒。**\n\n**技术**\n\n关于数据和存储：CyberConnect社交图数据存储时使用的IPFS和无许可协议Ceramic构建，联通Ceramic区块链锚定和自定义数据固定服务，可以保证CyberConnect链上数据长期存储。（使用Ceramic DID方法）关于用户数据在不同的平台如何集成，则需要采用Ceramic身份协议IDX，它为开发人员提供一个统一的界面，在CyberConnect内部查询这些数据分析，反过来CyberConnect也会给与DID链上系统提供更多的身份数据。\n\n与其它项目集成：同时CyberConnect还会与其它Web3项目集成获取信息，例如NFT平台Foundation与Rarible等，其实最重要的一点是让玩家通过一个统一的身份来参与不同种类的生态应用，同时也能与Web2链接使链上和链下数据结合起来成为更强大的去中心化数据提供商。\n\n**相关数据：**(数据截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注数：57,7k+\n\n生态项目数：30+\n\n入驻用户：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a7o2JaOaNfPgndwT2sSm3.png?height=108&width=679)\n\n融资消息：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MKRShXhLUbStaV7wGpQdV.png?height=127&width=685)\n\n其中的Multicoin曾投资过Near Protocol、Solana、Helium、Duna Analytics、Audius等潜力新兴区块链或者具有足够实际应用的优质Web3.0应用，此次Cyberconnect也正是该机构看好未来web3社交领域的潜力而开展的首次社交应用投资，证明该赛道的早期成长属性和该项目未来价值发掘。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgkZfhUF3wFkZo_i2RlCP.png?height=542&width=1145)\n\n**小结**\n\n社交化图标也是DID最核心应用场景之一。毕竟身份的重要程度随着社交功能完善等比例增长。虽然目前Cyberconnect已经接入Solana、Ethereum、Binance网络链，在用户体验感上来说，以太坊网络链是功能较完善且操作流畅，但部分操作功能在Solana上还处于开发阶段，不仅容易在网络上造成拥堵而且需要使用不同的钱包插件，使得用户体验感下降。\n\n作为一个去中心化的社交图谱协议，为Web3.0社会网络和元宇宙服务，CyberConnect还需要在前进的道路上完成更多的目标。\n\n### 3.5 Mirror\n\n提到去中心化的写作平台，大部分区块链用户都会脱口而出“Mirror”，其平台在成立不到一年就被联合广场风险投资公司估值1亿美元，获1千万美元投资。作为去中心化的写作平台赛道代表——Mirror 是依靠哪些去中心化特性和功能”荣登“宝座呢？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jylJj2d9u5m_YMYfOnvQA.png?height=601&width=865)\n\n**功能简介**\n\nMirror 跟中心化的写作平台最大的不同是，他具备加密区块链产品的特性和功能。参与用户无需通过邮箱账号，手机号码，社交帐户等中心化的身份验证手段来注册账号，只需要绑定自己的0x开头的钱包地址即可生成独一无二的“作者专栏”，类似于上文所提及的ENS（以太坊域名）。对于部分创作者来说，跟外界的接触仅仅由一串小小的字符连接，完美的融合了去中心化身份的理念。\n\n除此之外，创作者可以在Mirror平台上发布文章/创作图片等作品，每一件公开发布的作品不是保存在中心化服务器上，而是透过区块链存储专案Arweave进行链上的数据保存，经用户进行加密签名后生成一段哈希值记录，将作品永久的保存在区块链上。Mirror上更是支持创作者将自己的作品铸造成NFT，让原先没有边际成本、可被无限复制的内容作品具有稀缺性，从而被赋予价值。不仅无法被他人复制或修改，而且可以在各大NFT市场上进行售卖。\n\n其次，Mirror 也提供读者募资功能，读者喜欢的文章可以直接使用加密货币”打赏“创作者；共同的创作者可以按照设定好的盈利比例来获取各自部分的收益；以及其平台上的作品拍卖功能等等。\n\n**技术**\n\nMirror 在保存用户文章时使用的两类 Web3 组件，一个是用于对文章进行永久存储的 Arweave，另一个是用于对文章进行确权与交易的 NFT 铸造平台以太坊主网。\n\n1. Mirror 的存储组件-Arweave，是一条针对存储进行了底层性能优化的公链，因此用户在 Arweave 链上存储数据的成本相较其他智能合约公链平台有极大的降低。同时，链上存储的特征保证了在 Arweave 之上存储数据的永久性，因此，基于 Arweave 的存储模式也常被归类为永久存储。创作者在保存文章修改的时候，Mirror 会在后台自动对新的文章进行二次上链存储。\n2. Mirror 的确权组件，在存储的同时，通常会需要另一组 Web3 组件，以便对存储的内容进行确权，也就是将内容铸造为 NFT 格式的资产。但此步骤是在以太坊网络上以 NFT 的形式进行确权，成本由创作者自行承担支付。\n\n**相关数据（截至2022-05-23）**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KBnzoyVFQarlyXYYy6q9Q.png?height=70&width=698)\n\n**小结**\n\n去中心化创作平台-Mirror 的核心创新点很多，打破了传统创作平台的束缚，将NFT，社区DAO，Write-Fi相结合的经济模型，解决了部分去中心化平台所追求的“通过创作内容实现价值变现”的难题，相信 Mirror 这样肩负着去中心化任务的创作平台也会在迈向 WEB3.0 的道路上越走越远。\n\n### 3.6 Project Galaxy\n\nProject Galaxy 的愿景是想要打造一个最大的 Web3 数据凭证（credential data）网络，建造一个开放协作数据聚合基础设施，助力开发者和项目方建造更好的产品和社区。项目方在 Project Galaxy 平台上面为用户创建并奖励 NFT，用户完成项目方的任务，比如在链上进行特定的交互、参加会议、关注推特、加入 Discord 社区、提交问卷、参与测试等方式获得NFT。\n\n**技术：**\n\nProject Galaxy 目前支持两种方式来提供数据凭证 GraphQL 和 REST API。Galaxy上有两个角色，分别是数据贡献者和使用者。数据贡献者可以用子图查询或静态快照（subgraph queries or static snapshots）的方式贡献链上数据，同时在链下，Galaxy 也集成了信息来源，比如推特和 GitHub。\n\n数据使用者使用 Application module, Credential Oracle Engine, and Credential API 三种方式使用数据。并使用 Galaxy 的代币 $GAL 支付，因此数据贡献者可以获得激励。\n\n**相关数据**：\n\n已入驻项目方：400+\n\nGalaxy ID 用户：170 万+\n\nTwitter关注：30 万+\n\n融资情况：2021 年 5 月种子轮融资，2022年1月由 Multicoin Capital 和 Dragonfly Capital 领投、多个机构参投的 1000 万美元融资。随后 2 月在 CoinList 平台公募获得 1500 万美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gZN7tj9iV2lHWkssLK7Z3.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nProject Galaxy上线时间为2021年5月，运行不到一年，活跃用户量远大于同类型的项目 POAP 和 Rabbithole 。2021 年底银河女孩系列 NFT 活动让 Project Galaxy 一举成名，银河女孩 NFT 持有者更是获得了该项目原生代币 $GAL 在 CoinList 平台上公募的优先队列名额。后续 Meta Cowboy，Dr.SOL 等系列 NFT 持有者也获得了 $GAL 空投。\n\n**小结**\n\nProject Galaxy 无疑是一个非常成功的项目。链上身份凭证和数字身份一直都有市场需求，Project Galaxy 作为多链项目满足了市场在这方面的需求，为整个加密生态系统提供服务。在经历 Defi Summer 和 NFT Summer 之后 ，它抓住了 Crypto 项目方频繁使用 NFT 作为用户激励工具的需求。它给项目方提供了发放 NFT 奖励活动的工具和用户流量资源，初步形成了项目方和项目方之间，项目方和用户之间，用户和用户之间的多重网络效应。\n\n# 4. 新型社交的展望\n\n### 最初的载体与未来场景？\n\n绝大部分用户最熟悉DID理念实际运用应该是区块链钱包，例如Metamask是作为用户接入整个区块链的入口端，具有隐私性、安全性、不可追踪性。这是DID赛道最初应用成果，但是其缺点也很明确。钱包地址的注册缺少独特性，一个人可以注册大量毫无价值的钱包。其次大钱包只能显示代币难以展示NFT和参与证明等未来势必流行的资产，更不用说SBT所畅享的“无纸化”证明，这是钱包的局限性。第三钱包无法配置资产可编程属性，无法限制其他人查看钱包资产，从而导致黑客攻击情况发生。不过理念的实践是处于不断完善的过程。现在已经出现了可以展示NFT和参与证明（POA）的去中心化身份应用，还有隐私赛道对于钱包和其它DID应用进行代币隐私化、资产可视化等功能赋能等，预计不短时间内所有区块链赛道应用可以进行用户DID绑定，可记录用户等额抵押、合同签订、参与证明和哈希参数等不可篡改的数据，潜在提升单一用户DID价值\n\n从结构和理论上来阐述，有社交的地方更加注重身份特征，所以从根本属性上来说SocialFi就是实现该理念的最初赛道，只有用户们尝试并参与进来，才能够从本质上理解DID在区块链各赛道中重要程度，在未来去中心化社交领域当中，寻找相同理念思想的用户从而构建和谐关系，通过新兴匹配技术进行身份特征快速转移和整合，快速的梳理出用户兴趣爱好与社交圈，可以大程度的减少网络中诈骗行为，提高社交沟通交流效率。\n\n### 如何评估用户DID价值赋能？\n\n未来DID账号的价值根据其内部的资产总数和分配比例，如加密货币、NFT、参与证明等进行价值评估，以及个人身份信息验证，与其他用户之间互动，评论留言等进行附加属性评估。最后就是项目之间的筛选机制和会员资格评判，如拥有某些NFT或者证明的用户获得相应空投奖励、参与测试的资格等，这些都进一步的丰富了DID整体价值属性。\n\n对于目前市场来说，DID基础设施赛道仍未出现热点项目能引领该赛道的热潮，例如DeFi的火热是Uniswap带领的，GameFi的出圈前者与Axie有关，后者StepN再次引领，所以扩大潜在用户群体还需要落实到实际具体项目当中，单一可行的理念是无法吸引到足够的投资者的。\n\nDID赛道本身是没有主动生产价值的能力，创建了钱包地址不代表钱包有钱，但是从另一角度来说DID也是最能兼容区块链中所有领域的基础设施，其价值决定极大程度上基于与其它项目应用的兼容，毕竟DID属于后端程序，与个性化应用并不冲突。\n\n### 趋势预测\n\n在如今整体环境影响下，以NFT和GameFi赛道为首的炒作属性偏高的赛道整体估值下降较多，新用户和资金参与量明显下跌，而以Web 3.0等基础设施属性较强的底层架构融资情况增长。可以明确的是DID与SocialFi等赛道会长时间处于发展道路中，寻找相关实际应用和价值层次赋能，且随着未来涌入区块链赛道的用户会越来越多，下一个牛市用户数量可能会达到三到五倍的增幅，用户之间的社交属性和凭证需求会随着用户数等比例增长，所以目前早期部署该赛道，其未来潜力也是无法估量的。\n\n# 5. DID 与 SocialFi 发展过程中可能的挑战\n\nDID 赛道 和 SocialFi 目前处于早期探索阶段，有着巨大的发展前景，隐藏着许多仍未被发掘的机会，但同时也有着不少问题等待 Web3 建设者们去挑战：\n\n* 不可转让这一概念本身就存在着技术上的挑战，在限制或防止转移的需求和区块链生态系统之间有着难以跨越的障碍，因为目前来说，几乎所有的项目标准都是围绕着最大可转移性来设计的。\n* 隐私是此类生态系统良好运作的一个重要前提。许多情况下，用户并不希望透露他们所有的身份信息。去中心化的身份信息如何做到仅在必要的时候披露给必要的对象，也是在技术上所面临的一大挑战。\n\n一个只规范资本而不规范人类个人行为的制度可能只会无情地服务于金钱而非人类本身。我们作为 Web3 的参与者和建设者，需要更多的思考和更多的努力来解决这些挑战。而如果我们能够成功解决，则为区块链那些并非只关注金钱的生态系统，打开了一扇通往更为广阔天地的大门。\n\n## 参考资料\n\n1.

Các khoản đầu tư nổi tiếng trong danh mục đầu tư của công ty bao gồm nhà phát triển trò chơi và ứng dụng Dapper Labs, nhà lãnh đạo trao đổi tài sản kỹ thuật số OpenSea và công ty dữ liệu CryptoSlam.\n\nAmimoca phát triển các trò chơi, cho phép người chơi mua và bán các tài sản kỹ thuật số duy nhất được gọi là mã thông báo không thể thay thế (NFT) trên blockchain. NFT, có thể bao gồm đồ sưu tầm và ảnh đại diện trong thế giới game, là ưu tiên hàng đầu của Siu. Ông nói: “Chúng tôi đang cố gắng đầu tư vào bất cứ thứ gì tiếp tục hỗ trợ việc xây dựng các hiệu ứng mạng của NFT. \n \n\nNhững người hoài nghi đặt câu hỏi về nhu cầu xây dựng trò chơi điện tử trên blockchain. Các nhà phê bình cũng chỉ ra rằng NFT, được những kẻ lừa đảo sử dụng tự do để thực hiện giao dịch giả mạo và các hình thức gian lận khác, đang ngày càng làm xói mòn niềm tin của nhà đầu tư.\n\nTrong một cuộc phỏng vấn vào ngày 19 tháng 5 trên chương trình \"Crypto DeFined\" của TruthDAO, có sẵn trên Fireside, Siu đã chọn về những chủ đề này và các chủ đề khác, bao gồm cả triển vọng vẫn lạc quan của anh ấy về NFT, vốn gần đây đang đánh bại thị trường.\n\nNăm thông tin chi tiết hàng đầu từ Siu: \n  \n *Stablecoin sẽ được hưởng lợi từ quy định.*\n\nTheo cách Siu nhìn nhận, quy định là cách đáng tin cậy duy nhất để tạo niềm tin trên diện rộng vào thị trường stablecoin: “Một khi mọi người biết rằng điều này được các cơ quan chính phủ quản lý và ban phước, nó sẽ thúc đẩy việc áp dụng hàng loạt,” ông dự đoán.\n\n*Sự sụt giảm tiền điện tử là một cơ hội mua cho Animoca.*\n\n“Nếu bạn tin như chúng tôi. . . rằng đây là lần lặp lại tiếp theo của Internet… đầu tư ngay bây giờ hoặc thậm chí sau này không phải là một vấn đề lớn, ”ông nói. “Tôi không nghĩ về những gì sẽ xảy ra trong năm tới. Tôi đang nghĩ về những gì sẽ xảy ra trong 10 đến 20 năm tới. ”\n\n*Trẻ em là cánh cửa vào tương lai.*\n\n“Hãy hỏi trẻ xem chúng muốn gì vào Giáng sinh hoặc sinh nhật của chúng và đó có thể là thứ gì đó kỹ thuật số,” Siu chỉ ra. “Họ không nhất thiết muốn đôi giày đó hoặc món đồ thời trang đó - họ muốn thứ gì đó từ Roblox hoặc Fortnite.”\n\nTại sao điều đó lại quan trọng: “Theo quan điểm của tôi, việc nhìn vào hành vi và mong muốn của con cái chúng ta thực sự là một lăng kính cho tương lai. . . Đó là lý do tại sao, trong lĩnh vực công nghệ, mọi người đều tập trung vào giới trẻ… bởi vì họ cho thấy tương lai sẽ đi về đâu về mặt hành vi và mong muốn ”. \n  \n *Web3 kết hợp với nghiên cứu chất lượng sẽ đẩy lùi những tác nhân xấu.*\n\n“Chúng tôi đang ở thời điểm mà không gian đang phát triển và ngày càng có nhiều người chơi có trách nhiệm tham gia,” Siu khẳng định. “Thay vì một cơ quan trung ương đang cố gắng giữ mọi người có trách nhiệm giải trình, thực sự bản chất phi tập trung (của tiền điện tử) đang giữ mọi người chịu trách nhiệm theo một cách khác.”\n\n~~Theo Siu, hiệu ứng Darwin đã phát huy tác dụng: “Nếu bạn đã tham gia vào nhiều dự án mà kết quả là không tốt, thì khả năng khởi động các dự án NFT khác của bạn trở nên khó hơn… Đây là một quá trình trưởng thành” rằng hiện đang diễn ra trên toàn thế giới tiền điện tử.~~\n\nTại sao điều đó lại quan trọng: Các dự án được hỗ trợ bởi các nhà đầu tư có uy tín “là một cách để xác nhận rằng chúng là có thật, rằng quá trình thẩm định đã xảy ra, rằng chúng là xác thực. (Các nhà đầu tư) biết rằng sẽ không có một cuộc kéo thảm. \" \n  \n *Blockchain là một môi trường lý tưởng để chơi game.*\n\nTrong thế giới 2.0, sức hấp dẫn hàng loạt chính là điểm xuất sắc. Các nhà phát triển trò chơi thực sự cần hàng triệu người chơi để đạt được trạng thái lớn. Trong web3, điều đó không nhất thiết phải như vậy.\n\nSiu giải thích: “Phần lớn các trò chơi Blockchain chỉ có hàng trăm nghìn người dùng hoạt động hàng ngày. Tuy nhiên, họ thúc đẩy nền kinh tế trị giá hàng tỷ đô la. Đó là bởi vì có nhiều hiệu quả hơn về vốn. \"\n\n“Điều đó có nghĩa là bây giờ chúng tôi có một khuôn khổ (web3) nơi chúng tôi có thể có nội dung đa dạng mà không phụ thuộc vào việc tạo ra một trò chơi chỉ có sức hấp dẫn đại chúng.” Theo Siu, điều đó mở ra rất nhiều cánh cửa - và cơ hội tài chính - cho các nhà phát triển thuộc mọi quy mô trên toàn thế giới tiền điện tử.\n\nBạn có thể xem lại toàn bộ cuộc phỏng vấn tại đây. \n  \n *According to <https://truthdao(dots)news/animoca-brands-co-founder-yat-siu-still-bullish-on-nfts/>*", "timestamp": 1653380907, "digest": "MboDeJEMkc6RmJsGXhwhZpZhLUu2HI01i08Cf5l5-Ds", "contributor": "0xC85e1894400ee5651A634694067aC605212A8B95"}

The team aims to create a multi-blockchain Medieval Metaverse without boundaries. Players will engage in fierce battles of skills to protect their realms and gain tremendous rewards such as resources, territories, world domination, and so on.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nPlayers are given a choice of heroes to pair them, customize their powers, and adjust their own playstyle. Cryowar has a skill-based gampley, and provides the players with 9 main game modes. At the start of every match, CRYOWAR randomly cycles through a pool of level objectives changing on the fly. Players need to be prepared to instantly adapt to whatever the game throws at them. Each round lasts for about 3 minutes. \n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n**Allocation**\n\n$CWAR is the utility token of the CRYOWAR gaming ecosystem at large. A total of 1,000,000,000 CWAR tokens are minted in order to facilitate a sustainable in-game economy. The token can be used to buy NFTs (such as skins), and virtual land plots. The CWAR token is also set to be the official currency to buy tournament tickets in Cryowar.\n\nThe following figure is the detailed allocation info of CWAR. Notably, staking and rewards take up 45% of the total supply, which serves as a great incentive for its players to get involved in the game. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vUfUExN6jVRLAnIKY-6gA.png?height=325&width=377)\n\nUnlock Cycle\n\nAs illustrated in the following figure, the selling price of CWAR at Seed Round, Private Round, and Public Sale are $0.014, $0.018, and $0.028 respectively. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UQc71hgJg000W7d1JpQtC.png?height=369&width=531)\n\nCWAR is 10% unlocked at TGE in the Seed Round and Private Round, while 20% unlocked at TGE in Public Sale with the rest 80% a monthly linear vesting for the next 6 months. Thefore, the percentage of token unlocking at TGE is realatively low. The current market price (by 2022/5/12) of CWAR sits at around $0.047.\n\nIn public sale, the total funding amount was $620,000. The number of CWAR on sale was 22.9 million, of which 4.58 million was unlocked at TGE. The total earning was around 9 million, which gives the holders a 1452% return at best.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9gezQGj2lKkoQcDNsuyeB.png?height=430&width=564)\n\n**Burning Mechanism**\n\n   The team will also implement several deflationary techniques in order to keep the game economy stable, such as token burns. CWAR tokens will be burned through various methods, including in-game marketplace and tournament buy-in fees, with the added benefit of attracting new players and hyping the release of new gaming content.\n\n**Staking**\n\nPlayers are able to earn a certain percentage of rewards by staking $CWAR. The team provided holders with two pools to choose from. \n\nCryowar Gold Pool: 4 months lock period. Participants will receive a variable APY with high incentivised rewards: airdrop for first believers in terms of NFTs + small chances for random rewards.\n\nCryowar Diamond Pool: 12 months lock-up period. Participants will receive a variable APY with high incentivized rewards: airdrop for first believers in terms of NFTs + randomized rewards in terms of Skins, and 3rd party rewards.\n\n**NFT Introduction**\n\nThere will be various NFTs in Cryowar. All of the NFTs are still being worked on by now. It is expected that skin NFTs can be anticipated after the delivery of the NFT lands and open Beta.\n\n**Community**\n\n![(Till 2022/5/10)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nHtOScSdvMfpeg9-MoMoE.png?height=134&width=522)\n\nAs a project with a relatively large fan base, its member engagement doesn’t really follow through. Although its mods answer members’ questions timely, there simply just aren’t many interactions going on in its Discord and Telegram community. With an average likes and comments that rounds up to less than 250, the same situation applies to its Twitter posts.\n\n**Investors and Team**\n\nThe Dev team behind Cryowar are professionals in game design, blockchain development, security, cloud infrastructures and networking with more than 20 years experience. Some big names in the blockchain industry can also be found in its partner list, Animoca Brands, Polygon, for example.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8g5M4qWnJUaNNB-_iczdS.png?height=181&width=553)\n\n**Author:** **@BitMetis** **| BitReport**\n\nYour Source of Reliable, Unbiased Research and Due Diligence\n\n**BitMetis Review：**\n\n**Gameplay： PVP, PVE, Skill-based battle gameplay**\n\n**Tokenomics: $CWAR, decent token mechanism design, clear issuance cycle.

It is created based on Sun Yitian's diptych \"Flying at Dusk\". The image of the owl is generated according to the artistic creation model. Combined with the binding of data actions, a unique story is generated and permanently stored on the blockchain. The creation is inspired by the owl of Minerva, the goddess of wisdom in Roman mythology, which is a symbol of thought and reason. The white owls only appear at night, and the black owls only appear during the day. They chase each other, but never meet each other because of the reversal of time. The black and white owls seem to be two independent individuals, but in a certain sense, one is a clone of the other, and at a certain moment, a metaphor of identity begins. In the process of Owl's philosophical speculation, meaningless data will also be built into a new ideology with the artist's algorithm.\n\n**Artist Introduction**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FNM9_7xZaKsc26GJNAo7P.png?height=720&width=1080)\n\n\nSun Yitian (b. 1991 in Zhejiang, China) graduated from the painting department of China Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing (CAFA) in 2015 and earned her Masters at the same academy in 2018.

{"id": "6wj1oA8k8m11eb7HOhTqgHS-JEWmfMbORc8AynilFkA", "title": "What is Web3? Enough to read this\n", "body": "```\nAs a new protocol to describe the realization of decentralized consensus, since its appearance in 2014, Web3 has gradually become synonymous with public chain ecology, applications and even design concepts. Like other new concepts, the question of \"What is Web3?\" The new terminology may be unfamiliar to some people, so in this blog post, we introduce Web3 in 9 parts, together with some practical cases, so that you can better understand them in practice.\n```\n\n## 1. Web3 is a new term for the decentralized web\r\n\n```\nSince 2015, ConsenSys founder and CEO Joseph Lubin has been speaking, writing, and funding teams building Web3 and the decentralized web. The Web3 philosophy is the touchstone that guides all of ConsenSys’ early investments and projects. MetaMask is the primary way for individual users to access the Ethereum blockchain today, but there are, of course, many other Ethereum-compatible networks. It's a way to securely generate a public key on your phone or computer, but it uses a new norm of web interaction - only you have access to your account and data, and can choose what to share and what to keep private. Others liken MetaMask to an encrypted version of a consent manager.\n\nWhen we refer to the decentralized web, in addition to decentralized currency and identity, we also refer to other parts of the related technology stack. For example, for file persistent storage (such as IPFS and Arweave), decentralized storage (Golem, W3BCloud, etc.) and decentralized data (graph protocol), decentralized storage is becoming an indispensable part of the decentralized network .\n\nRight now, Web3 is the direction a16z and other big VCs are keen on, which means there are plenty of people on Twitter mocking, sarcastic, and even confusing. It's only a matter of time before Web3 takes its place in the public internet discussion, when these clowns may return to serve as evangelists.\n```\n\n## 2. Web1 is read-only, Web2 is read-write, Web3 is read-write + has information\r\n\n```\nWhen I asked a fellow Web3 developer how he would explain Web3, the short answer he gave was: Web1 is read-only, Web2 is read-write, and Web3 is read-write-own. The initial versions of the web were built on open source protocols such as TCP, IP, SMTP, and of course HTTP. Protocols are used as a standard way of allowing multiple computers to communicate with each other. These underlying protocols govern the flow of information and messages on the Internet, and if you want to build an application or service based on the rules of these protocols, there is no charge.\n\nWeb2 is a second-generation product built using free and open-source protocols on the Internet. The big shift that Web2 brought from the static, read-only Web1 website was that individual users could publish content to the Internet. What started as likes on Digg message boards has morphed into Weibo and now Facebook with more than 2 billion users. Another subtle change is that users don't need to maintain their own servers to keep their websites running, and Web2 companies bear the associated costs. But at the same time, they also created an information silo of user data, behavior, and activity to build a social graph with great advertising value. In the Web2 era, individual users are products.\n```\n\n[https://app.cyberconnect.me/address/0x024695E5Df5Ed0EF6b44668757d52Bd18C5981b5](https://app.cyberconnect.me/address/0x024695E5Df5Ed0EF6b44668757d52Bd18C5981b5)\n\n \n  \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1653381606, "digest": "iw1Zy0eejSkTZ5MDQKEHQXbdpdRvFTHCx_c4Nj_l00c", "contributor": "0x024695E5Df5Ed0EF6b44668757d52Bd18C5981b5"}

I believe it deserves to be available on Mirror as well. Minds that shaped the Web3 space should also be present on the Permaweb.\n\nHave a good read.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RplnSVTzvnU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RplnSVTzvnU)\n\n*“Economists have been exploring people's behavior for hundreds of years: how we make decisions, how we act individually and in groups, how we exchange value. They've studied the institutions that facilitate our trade, like legal systems, corporations,marketplaces. But there is a new, technological institution that will fundamentally change how we exchange value, and it's called the blockchain.*\n\n*Now, that's a pretty bold statement, but if you take nothing else away from this talk, I actually want you to remember that while blockchain technology is relatively new, it's also a continuation of a very human story, and the story is this. As humans, we find ways to lower uncertainty about one another so that we can exchange value.*\n\n*Now, one of the first people to really explore the idea of institutions as a tool in economics to lower our uncertainties about one another and be able to do trade was the Nobel economist Douglass North.He passed away at the end of 2015, but North pioneered what's called \"new institutional economics.\" And what he meant by institutions were really just formal rules like a constitution, and informal constraints, like bribery. These institutions are really the grease that allow our economic wheels to function, and we can see this play out over the course of human history.*\n\n*If we think back to when we were hunter-gatherer economies, we really just traded within our village structure. We had some informal constraints in place, but we enforced all of our trade with violence or social repercussions. As our societies grew more complex and our trade routes grew more distant, we built up more formal institutions, institutions like banks for currency, governments, corporations. These institutions helped us manage our trade as the uncertainty and the complexity grew, and our personal control was much lower. Eventually with the internet, we put these same institutions online. We built platform marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, just faster institutions that act as middlemen to facilitate human economic activity.*\n\n*As Douglass North saw it, institutions are a tool to lower uncertainty so that we can connect and exchange all kinds of value in society.And I believe we are now entering a further and radical evolution of how we interact and trade, because for the first time, we can lower uncertainty not just with political and economic institutions, like our banks, our corporations, our governments, but we can do it with technology alone.*\n\n*So what is the blockchain? Blockchain technology is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer-to-peer network. It's basically a public registry of who owns what and who transacts what. The transactions are secured through cryptography, and over time, that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data that are then cryptographically linked together and secured. This creates an immutable, unforgeable record of all of the transactions across this network. This record is replicated on every computer that uses the network.*\n\n*It's not an app. It's not a company. I think it's closest in description to something like Wikipedia. We can see everything on Wikipedia.It's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated. We can also track those changes over time on Wikipedia,and we can create our own wikis, because at their core, they're just a data infrastructure. On Wikipedia, it's an open platform that stores words and images and the changes to that data over time. On the blockchain, you can think of it as an open infrastructure that stores many kinds of assets. It stores the history of custodianship,ownership and location for assets like the digital currency Bitcoin,other digital assets like a title of ownership of IP. It could be a certificate, a contract, real world objects, even personal identifiable information. There are of course other technical details to the blockchain, but at its core, that's how it works. It's this public registry that stores transactions in a network and is replicated so that it's very secure and hard to tamper with.*\n\n*Which brings me to my point of how blockchains lower uncertainty and how they therefore promise to transform our economic systems in radical ways. So uncertainty is kind of a big term in economics, but I want to go through three forms of it that we face in almost all of our everyday transactions, where blockchains can play a role. We face uncertainties like not knowing who we're dealing with, not having visibility into a transaction and not having recourse if things go wrong.*\n\n*So let's take the first example, not knowing who we're dealing with.Say I want to buy a used smartphone on eBay. The first thing I'm going to do is look up who I'm buying from. Are they a power user?Do they have great reviews and ratings, or do they have no profile at all? Reviews, ratings, check marks: these are the attestations about our identities that we cobble together today and use to lower uncertainty about who we're dealing with. But the problem is they're very fragmented. Think about how many profiles you have.Blockchains allow for us to create an open, global platform on which to store any attestation about any individual from any source.This allows us to create a user-controlled portable identity. More than a profile, it means you can selectively reveal the different attributes about you that help facilitate trade or interaction, for instance that a government issued you an ID, or that you're over 21,by revealing the cryptographic proof that these details exist and are signed off on. Having this kind of portable identity around the physical world and the digital world means we can do all kinds of human trade in a totally new way.*\n\n*So I've talked about how blockchains could lower uncertainty in who we're dealing with. The second uncertainty that we often face is just not having transparency into our interactions. Say you're going to send me that smartphone by mail. I want some degree of transparency. I want to know that the product I bought is the same one that arrives in the mail and that there's some record for how it got to me. This is true not just for electronics like smartphones, but for many kinds of goods and data, things like medicine, luxury goods, any kind of data or product that we don't want tampered with.*\n\n*The problem in many companies, especially those that produce something complicated like a smartphone, is they're managing all of these different vendors across a horizontal supply chain. All of these people that go into making a product, they don't have the same database. They don't use the same infrastructure, and so it becomes really hard to see transparently a product evolve over time.*\n\n*Using the blockchain, we can create a shared reality across non-trusting entities. By this I mean all of these nodes in the network do not need to know each other or trust each other, because they each have the ability to monitor and validate the chain for themselves. Think back to Wikipedia. It's a shared database, and even though it has multiple readers and multiple writers at the same time, it has one single truth. So we can create that using blockchains. We can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly without actually creating that central authority. So all of these vendors, all sorts of companies,can interact using the same database without trusting one another.It means for consumers, we can have a lot more transparency. As a real-world object travels along, we can see its digital certificate or token move on the blockchain, adding value as it goes. This is a whole new world in terms of our visibility.*\n\n*So I've talked about how blockchains can lower our uncertainties about identity and how they change what we mean about transparency in long distances and complex trades, like in a supply chain. The last uncertainty that we often face is one of the most open-ended, and it's reneging. What if you don't send me the smartphone? Can I get my money back? Blockchains allow us to write code, binding contracts, between individuals and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out without a third party enforcer. So if we look at the smartphone example, you could think about escrow. You are financing that phone, but you don't need to release the funds until you can verify that all the conditions have been met. You got the phone.*\n\n*I think this is one of the most exciting ways that blockchains lower our uncertainties, because it means to some degree we can collapse institutions and their enforcement. It means a lot of human economic activity can get collateralized and automated, and push a lot of human intervention to the edges, the places where information moves from the real world to the blockchain.*\n\n*I think what would probably floor Douglass North about this use of technology is the fact that the very thing that makes it work, the very thing that keeps the blockchain secure and verified, is our mutual distrust. So rather than all of our uncertainties slowing us down and requiring institutions like banks, our governments, our corporations, we can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty and use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open.*\n\n*Now, I don't want you to get the impression that the blockchain is the solution to everything, even though the media has said that it's going to end world poverty, it's also going to solve the counterfeit drug problem and potentially save the rain forest. The truth is, this technology is in its infancy, and we're going to need to see a lot of experiments take place and probably fail before we truly understand all of the use cases for our economy. But there are tons of people working on this, from financial institutions to technology companies, start-ups and universities. And one of the reasons is that it's not just an economic evolution. It's also an innovation in computer science.*\n\n*Blockchains give us the technological capability of creating a record of human exchange, of exchange of currency, of all kinds of digital and physical assets, even of our own personal attributes, in a totally new way. So in some ways, they become a technological institution that has a lot of the benefits of the traditional institutions we're used to using in society, but it does this in a decentralized way. It does this by converting a lot of our uncertainties into certainties.*\n\n*So I think we need to start preparing ourselves, because we are about to face a world where distributed, autonomous institutions have quite a significant role.*\n\n*Thank you.”* \n \n\nFollow her on twitter [@BWarburg](https://twitter.com/BWarburg)", "timestamp": 1653381853, "digest": "BU7DdlSNRGuD3wLVagSHGhGDb7Nn6krJkarYDzsYXRQ",

{"id": "GJY3hFB8_QXZHbvZ38e_BuaZER6EkE9HDSqnkXNguOQ", "title": "LayerZero- An Omnichain Interoperability Protocol", "body": "For cross-chain bridging and messaging, almost every existing approach falls into one of two broad categories. The first is having a consensus forming middle chain validate and forward messages between chains. The second is running a light node on-chain. Let’s discuss.\n\n# Middle Chain\n\nMiddle chains receive, validate, and forward messages between chains. In this model, the middle chain is granted full signing power to all messages, making it a single point of failure. In the event of consensus corruption, all liquidity can immediately be stolen on all chains. With today’s middle chains bonding only hundreds of millions of dollars while securing tens of billions, as these chains become increasingly decentralized, it is not a matter of if but when this massive honeypot will be exploited.\n\n# On-Chain Light Node\n\nOn-chain light nodes receive and validate every block header for each pairwise chain on the opposing chain. Transaction proofs containing messages are forwarded and validated on chain against the block headers. This is the most secure way to transmit messages between chains. Unfortunately, it’s also the most expensive costing tens of millions of dollars per day per pairwise chain to run an on-chain light node on Ethereum.\n\n# Ultra Light Node\n\nOn-chain light nodes are extremely secure but also extremely expensive. Middle chains are inexpensive but less secure.\n\nIntroducing the **Ultra Light Node (ULN)**, the security of a light node with the cost-effectiveness of middle chains. This is achieved by performing the same validation as an on-chain light node; but instead of keeping all block headers sequentially, block headers are streamed on demand by decentralized oracles.\n\n# LayerZero\n\n[LayerZero](http://layerzero.network/) is a User Application (UA) configurable **on-chain endpoint** that runs a ULN. LayerZero relies on two parties to transfer messages between on-chain endpoints: the Oracle and the Relayer. When a UA sends a message from chain A to chain B, the message is routed through the endpoint on chain A. The endpoint then notifies the UA specified Oracle and Relayer of the message and it’s destination chain. The Oracle forwards the block header to the endpoint on chain B and the Relayer then submits the transaction proof. The proof is validated on the destination chain and the message is forwarded to the destination address.Security Properties\n\nIn breaking up responsibilities between the Oracle and Relayer, LayerZero leverages the security properties of the established oracles (Chainlink and Band) with an additional layer of security via the open relayer system. While this may seem only a small difference at first glance, its implications are quite profound. First, it means that the worst-case security of this new network still reduces to being as secure as the oracle. If you use Chainlink as your oracle any malicious action in the system is still predicated on first being able to defeat the Chainlink DON (no easy task). Even if the Oracle’s consensus is corrupted, it also requires that the Relayer is actively colluding. For example, in the most extreme case where the Oracle A’s consensus is corrupted and the Relayer A is colluding, all of this risk is only borne by those User Applications accepting messages from Oracle A ***and*** Relayer A. All User Applications using Relayer B-Z, running their own Relayer, or using Oracle B-Z remain completely unaffected. This is a massive transformation in terms of risk model from the previously described middle chain systems.\n\n# Use Cases\n\nToday cross-chain messaging is synonymous with bridging, but there is much more you can do with LayerZero than simply bridging assets. LayerZero enables cross-chain {state sharing, bridging, lending and borrowing, swaps, governance} And much more!\n\n# State Sharing\n\nSushiSwap exists on twelve different chains with each instance running in a siloed ecosystem. If they want to sync state with their main Ethereum instance, they’ll have to write code for using Wormhole, Rainbow Bridge, Polygon Network Bridge, Avalanche Bridge, etc. The end result is eleven sets of code, with eleven unique interfaces and eleven different security properties. Since the ecosystem of bridges and new L1/L2s is constantly in flux, this becomes an unmanageable proposition.\n\nWhen using LayerZero, SushiSwap would have one single interface and code base for all cross-chain pairs. They only need to implement **send** and **receive** functions**.** *Send* consists of forming a message for the destination chain and *receive* simply interprets that message.\n\n# Unified Liquidity Bridge\n\nBridges today compete to attract liquidity providers (LPs), fragmenting liquidity between bridges and their individual pairwise pools. Instead of having one pool that provides liquidity for an asset to all connected chains, LPs must choose a single pool that connects to one chain. LayerZero enables the holy grail of bridging: unified liquidity across all chains with guaranteed finality on the source chain. This means when a user transfers an asset from Chain A to Chain B, the user is guaranteed the asset on Chain B and the LP providers receive fees from all incoming transactions to Chain B regardless of the source chain.\n\n# Swaps\n\nExisting AMMs can be wrapped to perform cross-chain swaps from one asset to another without the need to modify any existing code. User’s will be able to swap from ETH on Ethereum to SOL Solana in one single transaction from the source chain.\n\n# Lending and Borrowing\n\nCurrently, if a user has money on chain A but wants to farm on Chain B the user would have to collateralize on Chain A, borrow, bridge (fee), swap (fee), farm on the destination chain, swap back (fee), bridge back (fee), repay the loan, and un-collateralize. With LayerZero you can collateralize on Chain A, borrow on the destination chain, farm, repay, and the collateral is unlocked; skipping the four bridging and swapping fees.\n\n# The Omnichain Future\n\nLayerZero will connect all chains seamlessly, having users unaware they are even using it. It will enable current and new Decentralized Applications to expand beyond the borders of EVM or Non-EVM, creating the world’s first omnichain applications.\n\n[https://app.cyberconnect.me/address/0xeB84Eb50afA10CB0B6D7Cd323Db1Fe710E586a69](https://app.cyberconnect.me/address/0xeB84Eb50afA10CB0B6D7Cd323Db1Fe710E586a69)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653382410, "digest": "VI6Zgrwlkw5C_cOEWMVOqckagKoyDLYctUBKkoOrhuI", "contributor": "0xeB84Eb50afA10CB0B6D7Cd323Db1Fe710E586a69"}

{"id": "N0N9Zz9gXoF4kZqQkHhm0svikShtg50IuKzEzpakQzo", "title": "Create A New Chain For Web3 Application?", "body": "**Web3 Meetup**\n\nI remember at the end of 2018, my companions and I organized blockchain technology workshop meetup, I invited ***Louis Liu*** to speak to the community partners about the future trend of Crypto, because he wrote a lot of in-depth articles to introduce Crypto and preach the new technology trend and business logic, I read all his articles and decided to invite him to our event,  he came to Wanxiang's conference and he prepared very detailed materials to explain what web3 is to the partners who attended the meetup, and he predicted that the application chain might explode in the future, and later he slowly enriched his theory and focused on cross-chain and application chain development, and finally established the Near-based [OctopusNetwork](https://oct.network/).\n\n**Application Chain**\n\nWhy do I bring up this story? Because our discussion about application chains at that time slowly turned into a real story, as we all know [AXIE](https://axieinfinity.com/) created its own new chain Robin, and [Defi Kingdoms](https://defikingdoms.com/) on [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) also recently announced a partnership with [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) to launch [DFKchain](https://docs.defikingdoms.com/how-defi-kingdoms-works/defi-kingdoms-blockchain) , which I understand as DFKchain equivalent to Avalanche’s sidechain or parallel chain, but in any case they have launched their own chain, and I predict that many applications will consider this option in the future.\n\n**Create your own public chain**\n\nI made a comment in the [Stepn](https://stepn.com/) community three days ago that I think they should also consider creating their own public chain that fits their product requirement. [Stepn](https://stepn.com/) is a project I really like because I'm a sports fan and have join half marathons events many times. As a participant in the Crypto space, I also expected some great Web3 apps to appear in Crypto industry. **Stepn** was on my watch list at the end of '21 when my friend  mentioned it in one talk show and I accessed their website to check out project information. I was a fans of ***Mable Jiang's podcast***, and later,  I learned the story of the two founders of Stepn on her podcast, which was very, very important for me to understand **Stepn**. Since then I've been following the project's development, becoming a loyal Stepn runner and participating in community discussions.\n\n**Uncritical thinking**\n\nWhen I tried to do an internal transfer after my run 3 days ago, the whole transfer process took 2 hours. This is not the first time this kind of problem happened, and users of Stepn community also faced this trouble long time, and I know that the reason why the chain transfer is full is caused by Solana's network problem. I also consulted with solana engineers about this problem, but there is no good solution.That's why I made a statement in the **Stepn community** that the team need to consider creating their own public chain, and the reasons for developing a new public chain are basically the same as **AXIE** and **DFK**.\n\n***Last night when I finished my activation with stepn, I suddenly remembered the discussion about application chains of meetup in 2018, and I realized that my previous statements in the stepn community were very inappropriate, and now my opinion is Web3 applications should not be urgent to create their own public chains.***\n\n**Why**\n\nThe question of whether Web3 applications should create their own public chains should be discussed in two ways：\n\n1. **Whether the existing public chains can no longer meet the requirements of the application?** Further, the team can determine whether the current public chain will not be able to meet the requirements of the application in the future as well? The usual view is that application chains are faster, lower gas cost, and low cost for users to use, which is a big reason for **AXIE** to leave ETH. Another reason is that it is highly customizable, all parameters can be adjusted, you can modify the execution environment, modify the wallet, the community own on-chain governance, or you can  reach consensus, upgrade the protocol, quickly evolve to adapt to new requirements, or troubleshoot software bugs, etc..For example, Axie Infinity, which has seen an explosion since it went live with its own custom ethereum strategy in April '21 because it reduced transaction costs by several orders of magnitude,and integrated fiat payments in the wallet, that making an explosion of whole protocol , which is the advantage of developing new public chains.\n2. **There is another important question for the team to think about, does the team have the ability to design a more perfect chain**? we know that ETH, Solana, or even certain ZK-rollup projects which  still face scalability issues, speed issues, decentralization issues, security issues now, but they can  solve these pain points  in a short time? Fork and Copy code ,modify parameters，it looks easy to develop a new chain, but running up a public chain that takes a long time and requires huge investment. So creating a new public chain you will still face the same problems in this industry, and the best way to solve the TPS  is to be highly centralized, but this also means a high risk, easy to be manipulated and other problems. Some time ago, we all know that AXIE was attacked. Although Flow and IMX are exploring this direction, it is still difficult to solve the above problems, and now all Layer 1 public chains are trying to solve these problems.\n\n**What to do?**\n\nWaiting and keep attention, keep learning, optimize the speed problem by other methods, such as cross-chain, share part of the pressure to other chains. waiting for the application chain infrastructure to mature and then deploy the product to these chains, such as Defi Kingdoms' attempt on AVAX, or wait for the maturity of Layer2 zk-rollup technology or you can try to based on multi-chain services like *OctopusNetwork*, rather than taking the risk to create new public chain.", "timestamp": 1653381664, "digest": "IYbI_4zMCkV2TclEYPsf1FHiRyK2h95RjcqBhxTt8hU", "contributor": "0xD033feF6d4C75CE2F4878314057C2F959FAB4679"}

These accounts are secured with a private key, which can be transformed into a 12 word “seed phrase” for the user. If that private key is compromised in any way, the funds can be stolen.\n\nIf your business comprises of more than 1 person, an externally owned accounts is not a secure way to manage your crypto business’s funds. If an employee goes rogue or is careless with the private key, the funds are gone forever. Even if your business is made up of just yourself, I’d argue it’s still a poor way to manage funds. So, what is the better solution?\n\nEnter the Multisig. Gnosis Safe is a smart contract wallet running on Ethereum that requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction before it can occur (M-of-N). If for example you have 3 main stakeholders in your business, you are able to set up the wallet to require approval from all 3 people before the transaction is sent. This assures that no single person could compromise the funds.\n\nOn top of that, Gnosis Safe gives you complete self custody over your funds. There is no risk of a bank giving you a hassle for running a crypto business and the smart contract that is deployed is completely trustless and in your control.\n\nHere's an overview, comparing the Gnosis Safe to other digital asset storage solutions:", "timestamp": 1653383040, "digest": "WGdV8mFJKqkdQ51dMVRbNZJghAQFkV7NiYCbKXG9ZQs", "contributor": "0xb80bd21033Cc4DcfDC9DfE5ec9E46cabd4128d8D"}

Metaverse already become a hot topic. We have seen many mainstream metaverses, such as Sandbox, Decentraland, Crypo voxel, world of web3. Can any speaker here share your opinion about how you understand the metaverse?\n\n### Vivi:\n\nI think Metaverse is really a very interesting topic. It is very close to the concept of Web 3, which in my understanding is about ownership sovereignty and freedom. We all heard about the concept from the book Snowcrash By Neal Stephenson. Everybody was talking about it. That was back in 1992, so for many years. The Metaverse seems like just another name of the evolution of the Internet. We could be more social, but actually more immersive. A16Z recently published a report that I think really makes a lot of sense. It says that broadly speaking, there are 2 competing versions of the Metaverse. One is a decentralized Metaverse with Property rights and new boundaries that interoperable open and owned by the community that builds and maintains it. That is more close to the web3 as I see it. Another Version is a centralized and closed Metaverse basically an extended version of Web 2 like elaine mentioned. Facebook changed its name to Meta. This is still like the same idea with all the platforms take most of the profit. So now which version do you support right? The open decentralized version is owners owning our own data and property right. But obviously, it’s like Shakespeare. so everybody has their own version of the Metaverse, but I think the the Metaverse combined with web 3, should give us open sources, decentralization and let us users owning our own data. We have the data ownership and sovereignty.\n\n### Jademont:\n\nI think Metaverse is a combination of multiple technologies, such as AI, Blockchain, cloud computing and big data. It attracted so much attention because everyone actually can jump in and find their own position in Metaverse no matter you are an investor, a programmer or an artist. I’m expecting not only a virtual word that people can spend their time and play, but also a new lifestyle that is in parallel with the current world where there’s no race, no country and everyone is his own Avater. One can only leave less than 100 year in real life, but can actually live forever in networks.\n\n## Q2: As we all know Metaverse is not unique to web3. Traditional web3 Internet giants such as Facebook ,Baidu are also deploying the web2 Metaverse. What’s the difference between these different Metaverse products? Which one is more promising in the future?\n\n### Andrew Fai：\n\nI have been increasingly worried about Facebook stands on Metaverse. I have a feeling that Facebook may hijack the definition. There is a lack of transparency happening with how Facebook uses users’ data. Nowadays, a lot of these hyper targeted ads are digging into your WhatsApp text messages, your Facebook Messenger, and digging into all your browsing history. I think this level of privacy is not really addressed on Facebook. This just makes me increasingly worried about how much they would know about me as I participate in their Mark Zuckerberg’s version of Metaverse. So I think there will be a competing narrative across like the Giants or Facebook, creating their own version of Metaverse.\n\n### Elijah:\n\nI think people will eventually realize the importance of their own data. Musk purchased Twitter and he says that he will be open sourcing the news feed algorithm. How user data will be collected overtime. That is a really big important moment in history, where for the first time people start understanding how much data these big web2 companies are collecting from them and they need to do something about it. And when that awareness start to arise, I think people are starting to leave. They will start to migrate from Facebooks, Instagrams or other web2 companies that are just stealing users’ data. They will embrace the new web 3 Metaverse that we’re seeing today. I believe it is mainstream.\n\n### Vivi:\n\nWe have faith that open and decentralized version of Metaverse will eventually take over. But it does take time for everything. To be honest, it’s really difficult to or it takes time to educate people, for example, to open a wallet and to really embrace that decentralized app. You know the applications that still struggling to catch up with the web 2 style kind of user experience. It takes time for infrastructure in web3 to develop and mature.\n\n## Q3: Under the background of the current bear market, how do you think the future floor price trend of these metaverse land and nft projects will develop?\n\n### Elijah:\n\nI choose to treat the MFT market as a consumer. So I’ve purchased rather than do a kind of speculative investment and I can relate to that that position. It’s essentially taking something that has no intrinsic value and creating its value through the network social capital. In the old Gallery system, this was essentially which group show you a part of which kind of creator put on your show. Which level of gallery represented you. Each gatekeeper came with a certain level of social capital and that created the value via consensus mechanism for the object in this case. The painting the photograph the sculpture, etc. And and I see the same thing unfolding with NFTS and that’s not necessarily a bad thing at all. Institutions and Instinctive organizations of society are based around.\n\n### Elaine：\n\nAs we know that nowadays there are many so many Metaverse Products. Users cannot enter into different Metaverse easily. so I think it is it possible that a future infrastructure can provide solution to build a Metaverse Bridge between different networks.\n\n### Jademont:\n\nI think Crosschain Metaverse is very necessary in the future. We can just imagine actually every Metaverse in future is just like a planet in the universe. There are isolated when the technology is not very developed, but one day they will communicate with each other by spaceship or other kind of technology. However, It’s a double edged sword. The traffic and wealth of one Metaverse will migrate from one to the other one which is more popular. I think for each Metaverse, you have to increase your own competitive power before you really make the crosschain Metaverse work. This is what we want to remind all of those founders of different networks.\n\n### CAT:\n\nOne thing I really concern is about the underlying engine. We see the Sandbox or the decentraland and or other new Metaverse. Every Metaverse was used different engine to develop. Even we use some bridge, as the underlying code so differential, people can not easily switch. So we need to develop some new infrastructure like the developer engine because there are so many underlying software.\n\n## Q4: Yugalabs provides sdk for other NFT projects, and are there any solutions which can help these 2d pfp nft projects change into 3d NFT and enter the metaverse?\n\n### CAT:\n\nSo the basically the first thing Yugalabs needs to do is to build the model. of the 2D-NfT. 2D-NFT projects need to cooperate with other brands to help them to turn 2D NFT into the 3D model and actually. We’re working on this value feature right now my project. Actually,we’re working on this feature right now. My project CAT is developing an avatar like platform. We made a 3D models for some corporative 2D projects so the NFT holders can directly use this kind of model to experience Yugalabs or something else.\n\n## Q5:Many web2 brands such as LV,NIKE ,ADIDAS are rapidly entering the web3 metaverse to build their own digital brands. What kind of services as an infrastructure can we provide for brands?\n\n### Igor Samaradziski :\n\nIt really does come to the utility. It boils down to the liquidity of viewership and popularity. So some of the really nice user cases we had recently were exposure of the designers that quite literally working from home. They map their clothes in 3D styles and create virtual fashion words, virtual fashion shows, which allow bigger brands to pick up and utilize those designs. Similarly, if you take a look at Adidas release in the early days. Who are releasing sneaker designs? How popular a certain design of NFT is depends on how many times it has been traded before the designer decide whether they want to actually produce that sneaker in life. It’s usually the product that is delivered to consumers that enjoy using it. As that liquidity builds up, we’ll see more and more brands utilizing this digital space to bridge their real real world applications.\n\n## Q6: in web3 world, DID become very popular, it’s kind of onchain social identity, what do you think about DID paradigm or new business model?\n\n### Jademont:\n\nI think it is a very promising technology for the Metaverse implementation. Instead of using a wallet address that is very long and hard to remember, people tend to use our short name like ENS, image avatar to represent their identities in Web3. This is one simple understanding for DID. A key point of DID is how people organize or even devices can be identified and located without centralized system of Identifiers. Metaverse is still evolving. It’s just the very beginning. At the first step, DID is designed for people like you and me. This is what most of the entrepreneurs that the founders are aiming for. In the future, I think DID is for everything, not only for Human being, but also devices like a machine or even cars. We have invested one project. They gives the electricity charger and DID to represent one robot. This device has a wallet , a Ethereum or pocket wallet. They can gain money from what they have done to the people. This is very interesting and I’m very excited to see what will happen. In this area, I think DID in Metaverse is a very interesting combination.\n\n### CAT：\n\nI just open my mind about the DID and another things because he mentioned that we also can just put the ID on other product or cars or something else. I believe it will be a hugedevelopment of the IOT industry because now we see the application of the web3 is just the customer application. Till now we don’t see any of the application on the factory and some other to B model so. I believe it will be a very bright future.\n\n### Jademont:\n\nIndeed, the idea is unnecessary factor for IOT plus blockchain or plus metaverse. The Technology development for the final metaverse is that there’s no difference between human being and the devices. That’s the ideal world for cyber punk. In the world you cannot tell the difference between a human being or robot because all behind is the DID.\n\n## Q7: from investors’ view, what are the new trends in Metaverse NFTs? what do you see the market go from here?\n\n### Jademont:\n\nActually we are looking for 2 kinds of projects. The first one is infrastructure, so that will make the blockchain adoption cheaper, faster and easier. For example, the NFT oriented public chains. The second kind of project. We are looking for is for products who are able to bring traffic to their applications.\n\n### Elaine:\n\nfirst trend i think is that metaverse and nft market will combine with socialfi, so this year, we have seen like like StepN，create a new model like X to earn ,it combined with a good socialfi , which turned out to be a successful Web3 product , nowadays metaverse are very single and individual, we would like to see a multi chain Bridge to link different metaverses together. So we would like to see more infrastructure to provide this kind of solution, They will bring their traffic to different and second trend i think is second time creation, nowadays we have seen some product combined with VR and AR echnique, so they can help artist to do the second time creation, so which would help the users to Show off their own NFTS, for example, if I am byc Holder. So I can use your product to do our second creation, and to share with my like social media, which is cool. And third trend I think is incubation platform like IDO platform for example, we have seen Outland JRLAND ,incubated and onboard many famous artists, such as fanglijun, their nft price perform very well ,so I would like to see more like this kind of incubation platform onboard with many a good artist.\n\n## Q8:Can you give some good advice on how to survive in the bear market?\n\n### Jademont:\n\nWell, I’m familiar with this question because I have gone three recycles since 2013. I’m an optimist. I think current situation is much better than 2018, the last bear market. At that time product teams were doing the fund raising Ethereum and then the bear market came. They cannot afford the salary of their team members. That was horrible. and wait for the next bull market. But for now, we’re doing fundraising using USDT, the stable coin. It doesn’t affect their stability of the team at least. So they have enough patience to develop their products and wait for the next bull market. So I think for developers and founders of the team members of one project, you just need to ignore all the noises in bear market and make your product get launched as soon as possible and build your community.\n\n### Andrew：\n\nI think that our first of all you need to budget yourself in terms of your available resources and exposure to risk to this market and second of all like. Need to have a very fine line between investing and gambling . These 2 are very different. Testing requires you to do very deep earth research. I will also consult experts to reach a well thought out decision entering the market, while gambling is just gathering enough data and just just. Just taking a bet, you know, so it got all you make a very big distinction between the 2 what I would say is like if you if you’re currently under the water or really suffering right now.\n\n### C.A.T:\n\nFor startup, we’re trying to do our best to go through the bear market.There are 2 things we try our best to serve. We will use the time to develop my product,add some more utility and to do some more color collaboration with it, too, just to build a great good product.", "timestamp": 1653383079, "digest": "oNC6JNSTUlgFJV7YfAlWuFpEH-Zw1fUSJqzGn_coyos", "contributor": "0x123bfD9040A61eC24feeaFf77FC22A6819320ee2"}

{"id": "v8L-Segx_jqsm43RXwg7ex2v82alvXNGJYpM9EFtLfA", "title": "UI Feedback", "body": "As a frequent user and a manager of a snapshot space from a small community, I’m very pleased to see my previous suggestions are being realized gradually by the amazing team and how snapshot keeps contributing to the success of DAO governance.\n\nFrom the times I can tell, it’s getting better and better in its **optimized creation flow**, **new** **quick access sidebars**, **notification dropdown**, **enhanced hovertips** and my favorite **personal profile** feature showing one’s voting history that I’ve never expected to launch this soon!\n\nI want to write this feedback as a follow-up of what I’ve submitted earlier this year before, from the voice of a long-term user, and also from my community members, sincerely wish these ideas will help snapshot go better in the coming future.🌟\n\n\n---\n\n### 1. Add a voting status in the proposals page\n\nThe counter in the right corner of a space shows the number of proposals that have recently entered into the active state, so I guess it’s not possible to make them disappear once a voter casts all the existing votes.\n\nHowever, is it possible to doing a workaround by adding a voter’s voting record at the bottom of **an active proposal item**, just like the “majority choice“ of a closed proposal, indicating that the user has voted this proposal. It can simply be a similar version of what’s inside the proposals votes list.\n\nIt will be of a great help since we often encounter situations where we have to load a series of proposals at consecutive intervals, and members may forget to pick each one of them or double vote on the same proposal since they can’t just remember each of their voting behavior in such situations. By enabling this improvents, people won’t need to click in to check their status, this helps much in governance efficiency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DC62Iu5BytfCmRcjGa5P0.png?height=369&width=835)\n\n### 2. Default starting time to “Now” when duplicating a proposal\n\nIn most cases, we don’t duplicate a proposal simply because of a typo or something like that. Rather, it’s when we find a mistake in our strategy or the proposal doesn’t meet our quorum due to special reasons, we have to do so since once the proposal is posted, it becomes immutable and we can’t revoke it.\n\nMost importantly, the snapshot of the proposal is based on the creation time of itself, not the starting time we set. It doesn’t make a lot of sense that the duplicated proposal still inherits the previous one, especially a very old one with which date we will just **post a closed state** **of proposal** at the current time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6u5JQMRNfqZutZ_lc2Uc.png?height=173&width=758)\n\n### 3. Unify the interaction dynamics on the creation process\n\nIt’s a typical thing mentioned by our authors, that sometimes they just cannot find the “Back“ button to navigate to the last page.\n\nWe found out that most likely it’s because of **the inconsistency** of the backward logic.\n\nThe current creation process is split into 2 pages: the main body of proposal, and the Choice form. While the interface has a different logic in these 2 consecutive pages, it can create kind of loss in user’s consciousness.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we should **add the “←Back“ button** to each of the creation page to bridge that inconsistency.\n\n![Inconsistency: Proposal Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0DX2Kw1zvXa3zZIu9cvTa.png?height=180&width=1253)\n\n![Inconsistency: Choice Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyODQDIYrVLQE9ycTV0Xm.png?height=203&width=1228)\n\n### 4. Integrate notification bells into one within the app\n\nI noticed that Snapshot now has a full list of notification methods we can choose from: HAL, discord bot, epns, webhooks… The notification bell within the space page seems a little outdated, and our members are often confused at what these two bells represent for respectively.\n\nIt spent me a while to get to understand that they actually control different ways of notification, but this also creates a sort of fragmentation within UI. Imagining one wants to turn off notification messages from a specific space he joins in the upper right dropdown list, there’s no way to do so, and the bell below the space name won’t work either, but to switch to another notifiation type.\n\nIMHO, we can make this page much neater by **integrating** the left notication bell with the newer one, and after that it will only point to one type of notification where user can actually control to accept a specific range of space messages.\n\n![two similar bells](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ujtOy7j3fj90TsTHabvT.png?height=426&width=1355)\n\n### 5. Highlight voting types\n\nPastachiodao is a very good example that I use it every time when I try to teach new members who are going to cast their first votes.\n\nBut sometimes when new members flood in, it’s inevitable someone doesn’t fully comprehend the meaning of the voting system or just neglect the voting type the proposal is using since it’s just placed in the upper right corner of the page.\n\nI’m thinking of a way just like what Pastachiodao did. But differently I want the ‘‘demo’’ directly embedded within a proposal in the simple form like **a short explained hint**, to remind the users which voting type they are acting on, to let them know they can actually choose one more options in an “approval voting” type. I can’t help thinking it because it would be a great attempt to further ‘‘educate’’ our users the knowledge of snapshot in a very practical way.\n\nIt can be in the choice form section **beside ‘“cast your vote“**, indicating a voting type.\n\n![a hint beside \"Cast your vote\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6N3uMa5G1q-rVr39Sqzt.png?height=421&width=790)\n\n### 6. Make visible the bottom bar in the homepage\n\nThe bottom bar provides essential information like official contact, display mode, language setting and official tutorials.\n\nThese elements are highly useful and should be **available at anytime** at least in the homepage. (experience from other well-known projects)\n\nHowever, if one hits the “load more” button, it just keeps loading down forever until all spaces will show up, and the bottom bar containing these information just keep **“blipping“** on each loading. One has to refresh the page to get it back to the original state.\n\nTo keep the bottom bar at a certain visibility level, I can think of 3 options:\n\n1. Pin the bottom bar like “freeze panes” in an excel, so loading will not break its existence.\n2. Add a load limit, like 50 spaces/load, after that, one has to retrigger the load manually.\n3. Keep it as it was. But after one hits the “load more” button and the load starts looping, one will be able to return back the state by hitting “snapshot“ in the top bar or “⚡“ in the sidebar.\n\n![Blip on each \"load more\"...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fTeNuFG5QZzzfxItSeGXw.png?height=219&width=1273)\n\n### 7.  Optimize the experience of edit box\n\nWe usually tweak our strategies in the UI, its original edit box. But the experience is not good, especially for a long code, every time an input will **bring the whole page to the top**, again and again, it brings us headache since we just **lost** where we were in the middle of job. I believe the issue also happens in any edit box like a plugin modal, or the playground…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DokWdmd9oj0EsZkKiZ7k.png?height=680&width=562)\n\n### 8. Strategy reuse\n\nFor different proposal types, we have different strategies to apply.\n\nWe know snapshot doesn’t allow the author to choose arbitrary strategies at his will. We successfully manage it at the admin level, to centralize the use of strategies.\n\nBut as such, we’re also considering for a DAO which has a pool of 10 strategies (and we use it on rotation like 3-4 strategies a time), if we can make things more efficient by keeping those **strategies temporarily not in use** in an “**inactive state”** rather than just deleting them and re-adding them back when it comes to use again?\n\nTherefore we don’t bother to write them again and can bring them back with just a click, which provides much more flexibility.\n\n![Adding a disable button besides delete?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0E6joStNfYGl_uYNbV-Zp.png?height=402&width=771)\n\n### 9. Preserve the input state of the keywords on strategies section\n\nThe number of snapshot’s strategies is exploding, which is good! However sometimes we can hardly tell the exact function of a strategy by its name and have to click in and run a test one by one.\n\nIt’s somewhat inconvenient when we click the return button, and it brings us to the whole list of strategy after we find out it’s not our strategy, we have to **input the keywords  again** to filter to the target lists.\n\nI wish the app can remember the state of our input keywords when we return to the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LWmGGniXeLhjlpBO-Pid6.png?height=290&width=1306)\n\nThanks for reading all the way through, hereby I give my best wishes to snapshot’s future as well as my community！❤", "timestamp": 1653383133, "digest": "XUFYktLBZvMnbNVihV84Iq0xq0hafZ_Rl8FbbO8uIKc", "contributor": "0x4F777E46C37fc4a2f70FdFB3a0A7C56C93EE82F0"}

PFP头像，这是目前传播最广泛的应用 \n2. Pass卡，高质量社区/项目会员卡、资格凭证，日前火爆的Moonbird就属于该类 \n3. 土地，对元宇宙地块进行确权，让税收和治理过程公开上链 \n4. 游戏道具，让玩家真正拥有属于自己的游戏资产，实现永久持有、交易自由 \n\n未来NFT的用例还将拓展到现实世界，让现实资产的上链，更加方便地交易和流通。可以说NFT是整个Web

代币协议\n\n\n代币协议，可以理解为NFT存在于链上所依赖的规则。不同的代币协议影响的是NFT在链上的交互方式。\n\n由于以太坊不仅仅是第一个使用智能合约的公链，也是NFT最开始诞生的土壤，所以很多公链的NFT协议都是借鉴于以太坊，NFT也带有“以太原生”的标签。\n\n### ERC\n\n\n**ERC-721：始祖协议**\n\nERC-721协议是目前NFT领域**最原始的协议**，也是运用得最多的代币协议。与普遍以ERC-20标准开发的代币合约不同，基于ERC-721标准开发的代币合约被统称为\"非同质化代币(Non-Fungible Tokens)。\n\nERC-721代币相较于ERC-20代币最大的区别就是**不可分割性**和**唯一性**——ERC-20 Token可以无限细分为10^18份，而ERC721的Token最小的单位为1。\n\n**ERC-721A：满减包邮**\n\nERC-721A是由Azuki NFT团队根据ERC-721协议优化而来的改进协议。该协议使得铸币者在铸造一个NFT和多个NFT时所产生的手续费基本相同，同时基础的铸造费用也大大降低。\n\n![Azuki铸造是的费用详情](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tXG65wjohLU5GiBeyZehR.png?height=611&width=1096)\n\n\n\n**ERC-721R：七天无理由退款**\n\nERC-721R是由Crypto Fighter团队根据ERC-721协议优化而来的改进协议。该协议提供了无需信任的退款设计，项目方将无法从锁定的智能合约中取得资金，使得**铸币者可以七天之内退还他们铸造的NFT**，获得不包含gas费在内的退款。\n\nERC-721R协议改进的地方不多，但是对NFT项目的发行环境具有重大的意义。通过七天无理由退款的机制，可以防止项目方违约(也就是跑路，Rug)，并敦促艺术家在退款期限对NFT和社区负责任；降低NFT购买过程的风险，给予铸币者反悔的机会，能够吸引更多社区成员参与铸造；保护NFT项目的地板价，当可以自由选择退款离开项目时，NFT玩家就没有理由以低于铸造价的价格在二级市场抛售，对项目造成破发影响。\n\n![Bilibili的NFT采用了ERC-721R的方式保护地板价，维护社区利益](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KWoPkmEoj4pNN2ziwqWTc.png?height=705&width=1052)\n\n\n**ERC-998：可拆解版721**\n\n基于ERC-998标准开发的代币合约被统称为\"可拆解非同质化代币(Composable Non-Fungible Tokens) , 目前该协议还未得到广泛应用。\n\n它的设计理念是可以让任何一个NFT可以携带其他的NFT或FT。转移CNFT时，就是转移CNFT所拥有的整个层级结构和所属关系。简单来说就是一个**ERC-998的Token可以包含多个ERC-721形式的Token**。\n\n该协议将对链游、元宇宙生态具有创新性的意义。以机甲游戏为例，一台机甲包含本体和挂载的武器配件，本体的属性是ERC-721，挂载的武器配件同样也是ERC-721，而机甲的完全体，就意味着两种NFT的结合。如果在传统的ERC-721机制下交易机甲NFT，持有者就得分别交易本体NFT和武器配件NFT。\n\n而ERC-988则简化了这个繁琐的过程。 当我们需要交易该机甲前，我们可以将ERC-721的本体作为父Token，ERC-721的挂载武器作为子Token**建立一个新的ERC-988代币**。这个新代币的整体是不可分割的，但也包含了机甲本体对挂载武器的所有权关系。因此我们**交易机甲时可以交易这个ERC-988代币的整体**，极大简化了NFT交易的步骤。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iIjVIJRr03gIb4mAUnoYn.png?height=713&width=1267)\n\n**ERC-809：可租用版721**\n\n基于ERC-809标准开发的代币合约，可以通过创建一个API来允许用户租用任一“可租赁”的NFT。但是该协议具有排他性，有人对该NFT进行租赁后，其他用户便无法再租赁和使用该NFT了。\n\n![链游Star Sharks的NFT可通过租赁的方式提供给其他玩家](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vAMTpAqjXqzemIhX1LfvK.png?height=684&width=1266)\n\n\n**ERC-1155：为链游而生**\n\n该协议是ERC-721和ERC-988的升级版，由Enjin团队开发，我认为是未来NFT领域最有前景的协议。\n\nERC-1155不仅仅继承了ERC-988的特性，能够使得复数个ERC-721的NFT共存于一体，还支持于普通ERC-20的代币一同打包；并且**ERC-1155还具有自动退还代币的功能**，如果接收方不支持ERC-1155协议则会自动退还，不像ERC-721协议一样，如果接收方不支持则会造成代币丢失。总而言之，ERC-1155协议在代币打包发送和防止发送过程中的丢失做出了极大的创新。\n\nERC-20协议代币和ERC-1155协议代币的发送流程对比如下：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e1-QZAvJqanUrhk0CMWMm.png?height=981&width=1268)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BtncTucMGAsOuO37G73dE.png?height=981&width=1268)\n\n我们可以用购物结账来描述ERC-1155、与ERC-20、ERC-721的不同点。\n\nERC-20和ERC-721的交易模式，就是每买一件商品都要去柜台结账，而ERC-1155相当于将商品都**放进购物车里面一次性进行支付**。ERC-1155这台购物车里不仅仅能放NFT，还能放不同的代币，这种机制能有效的减少Gas费的产生和减缓以太坊的拥堵。\n\n未来元宇宙、链游普及，所有的游戏资产上链后，涉及装备的交换、同质化产品贸易的需求会越来越多，普及使用ERC-1155协议将**免去成千上万个合约的部署**，并为有效解决链上交易拥堵的情况。\n\n### BSC\n\n\nBEP-721\n\nBSC(BNB Chain)上使用的代币协议一般是BEP开头的，同质化代币使用的是BEP-20协议，非同质化代币使用的是BEP-721协议。\n\n为何与以太坊所使用的ERC-20/ ERC-721协议如此相似?是因为BSC是以太坊增加了一些机制变化后的一条分叉，许多代币标准都是一样的，也就是说**BEP-721和ERC-721只存在命名上的区别**。\n\n### SOLANA\n\n\nSPL\n\nSOLANA上的代币**都是SPL Token格式**的 (Solana Program Library Token)，NFT对应的SLP Token只是将供应集固定等于1。Solana上的NFT通常附带部分的元数据，因此非常容易部署和传输，不需要像以太坊上的NFT需要调用合约和各种传输函数。SPL格式的NFT需要现实图片数据的时候不用进行合约调用，**Token内自带访问NFT元数据的URL**。\n\n### 数据存储\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MJFQ5UHuIjoSMWa-OpBoW.png?height=875&width=914)\n\n\n我们熟知的NFT图片数据并不是存放在链上的，而是存放在链下的存储介质。\n\n从官方文档摘取的ERC-721伪代码我们可以了解到，**ERC-721协议仅支持静态元数据**，每个代币ID必须具有由智能合约或管理的元数据URI。\n\n当我们在设备上加载NFT的图片时，我们并不是直接从链上获取数据的，而是**通过调用合约获取NFT对应的tokenURL，然后通过这个URL链接访问外部互联网获取图片数据并进行展示**。\n\n目前主流的NFT项目方都会将图片元数据上传至IPFS网络进行存储，也有部分新兴项目通过ARweave进行保存，以上两种方法都是相对去中心化的保存形式；而有些项目方会直接使用自己的服务器进行保存，NFT的URL直接指向的是中心化的服务器，有时候我们单独点击NFT图片的URL却加载不了的原因，很可能就是项目方的服务器出现问题了。\n\n通过IPFS、ARweave、中心化服务器对NFT元数据的保存各有长短，接下来将细数其中的存储机制与优劣。\n\n**1.中心化服务器**\n\n目前有部分的NFT项目直接选择中心化的服务器如阿里云、AWS存储数据,还有的项目方选择自己已有的服务器进行存储。原因就是不用产生额外的存储成本,并且数据加载的速度更快。\n\n但是问题也很明显，当项目方rug（跑路）或者服务器被攻击的时候，图片数据就会丢失，你的NFT就只是一个“永远加载不出来图片”的代币。\n\n根据Twitter KOL pencilflip在2021年10月对前22个NFT项目的一次调查，50%的项目将他们的文件存储在集中式服务器上。\n\n目前**国内的数字藏品**项目也基本上都是用fork公链的魔改联盟链发行NFT代币，用自己的服务器存NFT的图片。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KBac-0OMKICoC4X-sfKPC.png?height=703&width=960)\n\n**2.IPFS协议（Filecoin）**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Wm5jsfENJ5SjUmxbqKjSm.png?height=605&width=1078)\n\nIPFS，全称Interplanetary File system，是一个点对点分布式文件系统，是**一个类似于HTTP协议的互联网底层协议**。尽管IPFS和Filecoin都是由Protocol Labs（协议实验室）发布的，但是IPFS只是传输协议，**并不涉及区块链技术**，Filecoin只是支持IPFS协议网络去中心化稳定运行的激励层。\n\n相对于传统的点对点传输，IPFS有多个数据源对文件进行进行保存，且可以并发从多个节点下载数据，避免了访问量暴增或者DDOS攻击导致服务器宕机；通过基于内容寻址的存储模式，不仅避免了冗余内容的存储，还避免了数据篡改的发生。\n\nNFT具体的数据存储过程如下：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pPxMADA6lkNAkM8aETSo2.png?height=981&width=1268)\n\nCID是将文件通过哈希SHA2-256加密加密后生成的一串哈希值，是一个根据内容本身形成的一种IPFS系统中的地址。生成CID后，系统会将其存到一张分布式哈希表 (DHT)中，用于记录数据记录在系统中的哪几个节点，数据存储成功后将向用户返回哈希值CID。\n\n例如我们将一张图片上传后，我们获得一串哈希值：bafkreibsxcrpftxxw4i6nwrn4aigphI24m42e5jhdouq4jde3keonpqawa\n\n当我们要从IPFS系统中取回NFT图片数据时，我们可以将获得的哈希值修饰成网址然后在浏览器中打开。网址后面附带的哈希值CID将从IPFS系统中的分布哈希表(DHT)得知数据存放在哪个节点中，并建立链接返回数据。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lNRn7USAdm6OJhAhH_2_4.png?height=981&width=1268)\n\n例如我们将这串哈希值修饰成网址后，我们就可以从IPFS系统中获取这张NFT图片\n\n[https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreibsxcrpftxxw4i6nwrn4aigphI24m42e5jhdouq4jde3keonpqawa](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreibsxcrpftxxw4i6nwrn4aigphI24m42e5jhdouq4jde3keonpqawa)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yCd5O41TbxviE5RJNDiiJ.png?height=683&width=1267)\n\nIPFS还支持将静态网页存放，具体的方式如下：\n\n[https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/single-page-website](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/single-page-website)\n\nVisa存放案例\n\n[https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYVd8qstdXtTd1quwv4nJen6XprykxQRLo67Jy7WyiLMB](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYVd8qstdXtTd1quwv4nJen6XprykxQRLo67Jy7WyiLMB)\n\n\nUniswap前端存放案例\n\n[https://bafybeiagkgmmhux6fswdoedmwqqsvt5arjivl35wuk25jljb2yqgn7njgu.ipfs.dweb.link/#/swap](https://bafybeiagkgmmhux6fswdoedmwqqsvt5arjivl35wuk25jljb2yqgn7njgu.ipfs.dweb.link/#/swap)\n\n（以上网站皆为案例，切勿使用）\n\n有时候访问IPFS系统获取数据的时间要很久或者失败，是因为有一些网络节点已经丢弃你的数据了，正在根据DHT访问还有保存你的数据的节点并等待他们响应；而访问失败则是因为所有节点都已经丢失了存放的数据了。\n\n这里不得不提到IPFS系统的**垃圾回收（Garbage Collection）机制**。如果你的数据在6个月内没有被访问，那么节点就会认为他不重要并进行删除。如果想要数据长期保存，则需要通过Pinata网站等服务商对保存的数据进行Pinning，并**每年支付费用**。\n\n也就是向节点支付费用，要求他不要删除你的数据。这一点反映了IPFS系统在短期安全存储的方面是可行的，而对长期存储并不友好。\n\nIPFS仅能实现数据去中心化存储、防篡改，但不能保证数据的永久存储\n\n**3.Arweave**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q1LS-eDS4UOL5Bjes0k1K.png?height=504&width=983)\n\n永久存储，是Arweave这个区块链网络的头号标签。\n\nArweave目前提供的核心服务是**为数据提供分布式永久存储的支持**，致力于成为Web 3.0时代的数据存储基础设施。相较于Ethereum，Arweave可以归类为第0层。\n\n围绕其底层的储存服务，目前Arweave已经逐渐构建起一套基于其永在网permaweb的协议生态和SmartWeave智能合约生态，正在向WEB3全栈协议发展。\n\nArweave是如何保证永久存储的？\n\n依靠[BlockWeave](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34073/blockweave)区块的数据结构以及SPoRA共识机制\n\n**BlockWeave**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PNJuj_BetuwtmcIYHQ9Gn.png?height=981&width=1268)\n\nArweave的区块不同于普通的区块，其新生成的区块会随机指向一个已经存在的区块，该区块被成称为“Recall Block”。由于其区块链的机构在三维中很像纺锤，因此将Arweave的区块称为BlockWeave（区块纺）\n\n**SPoRA共识机制**\n\n该共识基础是实现数据永久存储的核心。SPoRA共识机制由三个维度决定矿工能否获取区块记账权：\n\n1\\.PoA (Proof of Access)\n\n为了让矿工能尽可能储存更多的区块信息，SPoRA共识机制决定了**新区块产生时随机指向的网络中已有的区块 “Recall Block” ，该矿工节点必须拥有**。因此矿工为了能抢夺记账权获得代币就会尽可能地多存储区块\n\n2\\.数据访问速度\n\n为了不让矿工为了达成“全区块存储”而使用廉价机器的行为，SPoRA机制加入了数据访问速度的衡量，让节点在存储大量数据的同时**保证数据的上传下载速度**。\n\n3\\.PoW (Proof of Work)\n\n为了避免存在有节点将所有区块存储完、数据访问速度相同的平等情况出现，SPoRA还有一个如BTC的PoW机制要求节点计算哈希值，同等水平的节点谁计算得越快谁获取区块记账权。\n\nSPoRA共识机制通过三方面的结合，保证了数据存储过程不仅安全，而且数据的副本足够多且从Arweave中访问数据的速度快。\n\nBlockweave的纺状架构自带[分片](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture))属性和高可扩展性，以及SPoRA共识机制确保了矿工接受足够的激励去存储稀有的数据，共同实现了数据的永久存储。\n\n具体的数据存储过程如下 (以Mirror.xyz文章发布为例)：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gEqSqNVU4HB8FAWoFJHzP.png?height=988&width=1191)\n\n首先我们在mirror发布一篇文章\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RCtFTN_-2vVoxNWuNG-KA.png?height=859&width=1268)\n\n通过交易哈希我们可以看到，当我们点击发布的时候mirror通过API直接将文件内容上传至Arweave上，并且通过Arweave的链接我们可以直接访问我们发布的内容。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cKQsL2a9tBhrTI0rsXkjx.png?height=634&width=914)\n\n点击Arweave返回的链接，我们可以留意到图片数据并没有保存到Arweave上，而是保存在了Mirror自己的服务器中了，也许这也是考虑到数据上传和下载的时耗。同时也可能是为了费用的节省，因为现在Mirror文章发布的存储费用是Mirror.xyz负责支付的。\n\n总体的流程为：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-P-Y-Kt5UZ22zQDTRJrKi.png?height=1079&width=1394)\n\n目前采用Arweave存储元数据的公链有Ethereum、Solana、Near，而将数据跨链到Arweave则交由**中间件Bundlr**进行处理。\n\nBundlr会严格检查上传文件的情况，若有上传文件丢失或被删除，则会破坏该区块的上传而等待下一个区块，确保了跨链数据能完全存储到Arweave上。\n\n除了跨链存储，Bundlr还有一项新技术——**Bundles**，将Arweave的可扩展性又上升了一个维度。Bundles可以将任意数量的数据，通过L2压缩成单个可以被L1处理的数据，因此Bundlr中间件的采用也让Arweave 的交易容量得以线性增加。\n\n**IPFS与Arweave的对比**\n\n* Arweave的数据存储费用为买断制，永久存储1GB的数据只需20美金，文件至少在网络内存储200年。\n\n\nIPFS (Filecoin) 的数据存储模式是按年支付存储费用的，存储1GB的数据需要0.06美金/年。\n\n* Arweave直接向网络进行付费，IPFS (Filecoin) 需要前往第三方网站Pinata为节点进行付费。\n* \n  Arweave的数据访问速度远快于IPFS网络，不存在访问已存数据节点但是数据丢失的情况。\n\n\n由于Arweave可以实现永久储存，因此许多项目方用Arweave对数据实现永久托管和验证。\n\n比如知名链下治理工具**Snapshot**就采用Arweave来储存投票治理的记录（先存到IFPS，再镜像到Arweave做永久备份）\n\n并且大部分Web 3.0项目，不仅仅本文所处的写作平台**Mirror.xyz**, 还有**Mask Network**、**MYNFT**、**Beeple**也选择了Arweave作为存储方案\n\n**Arweave的优势**\n\n![上图为Okay Bear的数据存储方式/下图为Portals的数据存储方式，均为Solana的NFT项目](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZsTA92L7TbeAY0-upvBz_.png?height=1898&width=1267)\n\n由于IPFS先入为主，并且项目与IPFS技术间的协调更加成熟，**大部份项目还是采用IPFS进行存储**，其中不乏已经与Arweave有深度合作的Solana链的项目。\n\n但是使用Arweave开展NFT项目的前景是远超IPFS的，不仅仅是其**永久存储**的特点和**访问速度**的保证，还有一个最重要的亮点：\n\n**Arweave自带的智能合约，赋予NFT原子化的可能。**\n\nArweave支持**直接在公链上铸造和交易NFT**，而并不仅仅局限于帮其他生态的NFT项目保存元数据，这一切得益于他的**SmartWeave智能合约生态**，以及在Arweave之上的**Permaweb永在网协议生态**。\n\nArweave上的NFT协议与以太坊为首的ERC-721协议大不相同，由于以太坊无法支持大量数据的热存储且成本高昂，因此协议规定NFT的元数据字段指向链下的存储地址进行保存。但是**Arwaeve可以在铸造NFT的同时将NFT的元数据保存到链上，真正使NFT成为一个完整而不可分割的一个整体**。\n\n这就是原子化NFT——Atomic NFT，解决了对NFT数据存储安全的信任问题。用户不再需要了解元数据以及各类存储方式等复杂概念，NFT的所有权与数据的所有权合为一体，使得交易过程实现了所见即所得。Atomic NFT对未来的音频甚至视频等多媒体文件NFT的创作和发展提供了良好的基础。\n\n### 对NFT的思考\n\n\n新技术的出现总会伴随着泡沫，NFT的唯一性和带来的资产确权，让NFT成为炒作的良好介质。但是**NFT不会止步于成为一张图片，而将会成为一种新的经济模式的载体**、Web 3.0这座数字金字塔的根基。\n\n在不远的将来，流媒体中的插播的广告视频可以NFT化，通过智能合约自动根据浏览量进行分润，高效、透明且公正；网络音乐可以NFT化，商业活动进行音乐NFT的使用可以自动通过智能合约向创作者支付设定好的费用，保护创作者版权；线下实体活动的门票也可以NFT化，出让、转赠、核实更加方便，同时杜绝假票。\n\n实现这一切的前提，是**NFT数据的安全存储**，NFT的任何元数据都不应该有被删除的风险。相对于中心化的存储服务，通过IPFS和ARweave存储NFT图片元数据虽然牺牲了读取效率，但获取了存储安全的保证，这对NFT的所有权是至关重要的。想象一下，当你点开一个NFT的链接，却发现它显示“无法打开”的情景，又或者是项目方可以在中心化的存储介质随意修改你的NFT元数据，那么这个NFT真正属于你吗？\n\n期待泡沫褪去后，NFT在Web 3.0浪潮中绽放异彩。\n\n###

Because our discussion about application chains at that time slowly turned into a real story, as we all know [AXIE](https://axieinfinity.com/) created its own new chain Robin, and [Defi Kingdoms](https://defikingdoms.com/) on [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) also recently announced a partnership with [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) to launch [DFKchain](https://docs.defikingdoms.com/how-defi-kingdoms-works/defi-kingdoms-blockchain) , which I understand as DFKchain equivalent to Avalanche’s sidechain or parallel chain, but in any case they have launched their own chain, and I predict that many applications will consider this option in the future.\n\n**Create your own public chain**\n\nI made a comment in the [Stepn](https://stepn.com/) community three days ago that I think they should also consider creating their own public chain that fits their product requirement. [Stepn](https://stepn.com/) is a project I really like because I'm a sports fan and have join half marathons events many times. As a participant in the Crypto space, I also expected some great Web3 apps to appear in Crypto industry. **Stepn** was on my watch list at the end of '21 when my friend  mentioned it in one talk show and I accessed their website to check out project information. I was a fans of ***Mable Jiang's podcast***, and later,  I learned the story of the two founders of Stepn on her podcast, which was very, very important for me to understand **Stepn**. Since then I've been following the project's development, becoming a loyal Stepn runner and participating in community discussions.\n\n**Uncritical thinking**\n\nWhen I tried to do an internal transfer after my run 3 days ago, the whole transfer process took 2 hours. This is not the first time this kind of problem happened, and users of Stepn community also faced this trouble long time, and I know that the reason why the chain transfer is full is caused by Solana's network problem. I also consulted with solana engineers about this problem, but there is no good solution.That's why I made a statement in the **Stepn community** that the team need to consider creating their own public chain, and the reasons for developing a new public chain are basically the same as **AXIE** and **DFK**.\n\n***Last night when I finished my activation with stepn, I suddenly remembered the discussion about application chains of meetup in 2018, and I realized that my previous statements in the stepn community were very inappropriate, and now my opinion is Web3 applications should not be urgent to create their own public chains.***\n\n**Why**\n\nThe question of whether Web3 applications should create their own public chains should be discussed in two ways：\n\n1. **Whether the existing public chains can no longer meet the requirements of the application?** Further, the team can determine whether the current public chain will not be able to meet the requirements of the application in the future as well? The usual view is that application chains are faster, lower gas cost, and low cost for users to use, which is a big reason for **AXIE** to leave ETH. Another reason is that it is highly customizable, all parameters can be adjusted, you can modify the execution environment, modify the wallet, the community own on-chain governance, or you can  reach consensus, upgrade the protocol, quickly evolve to adapt to new requirements, or troubleshoot software bugs, etc..For example, Axie Infinity, which has seen an explosion since it went live with its own custom ethereum strategy in April '21 because it reduced transaction costs by several orders of magnitude,and integrated fiat payments in the wallet, that making an explosion of whole protocol , which is the advantage of developing new public chains.\n2. **There is another important question for the team to think about, does the team have the ability to design a more perfect chain**? we know that ETH, Solana, or even certain ZK-rollup projects which  still face scalability issues, speed issues, decentralization issues, security issues now, but they can  solve these pain points  in a short time? Fork and Copy code ,modify parameters，it looks easy to develop a new chain, but running up a public chain that takes a long time and requires huge investment. So creating a new public chain you will still face the same problems in this industry, and the best way to solve the TPS  is to be highly centralized, but this also means a high risk, easy to be manipulated and other problems. Some time ago, we all know that AXIE was attacked. Although Flow and IMX are exploring this direction, it is still difficult to solve the above problems, and now all Layer 1 public chains are trying to solve these problems.\n\n**What to do?**\n\nWaiting and keep attention, keep learning, optimize the speed problem by other methods, such as cross-chain, share part of the pressure to other chains. waiting for the application chain infrastructure to mature and then deploy the product to these chains, such as Defi Kingdoms' attempt on AVAX, or wait for the maturity of Layer2 zk-rollup technology or you can try to based on multi-chain services like *OctopusNetwork*, rather than taking the risk to create new public chain.", "timestamp": 1653383791, "digest": "IYbI_4zMCkV2TclEYPsf1FHiRyK2h95RjcqBhxTt8hU", "contributor": "0xD033feF6d4C75CE2F4878314057C2F959FAB4679"}
