{"id": "A-ClZi72gVAv4kYegsqelkX3bvHPFiBJVXNI8DnwBxs", "title": "The Data Availability problem: A Brief History and Bright Future", "body": "### The Data availability problem:\n\nIn the simplest of terms, Blockchains are a set of virtual computers agreeing on the same set of actions, and following the same rules. The set of rules they follow is commonly referred to as a consensus algorithm, with valid actions according to a virtual machine.\n\nInevitably, this leads to an unavoidable situation wherein Blockchains and the data they store are siloed from the outside world. Therefore, any interaction they have with an external data source introduces additional trust assumptions. The data that is available natively on-chain is held entirely by **full nodes** ‘running’ the blockchain. Where **archival nodes** are expected to store historical blockchain data and historical state changes, full nodes manage the *current state* of the blockchain. In addition, full nodes serve the chain data upon request to the agents that wish to interact with the blockchain.\n\nThis additional responsibility of full nodes is the central source of the “data availability” problem. In brief, when a new block is posted to the chain, how can full nodes be certain that the data is:\n\n**1) Complete (every transaction of the proposed block is available for download)   and;**          \n\n**2) Correct (the transactions are not fraudulent)**\n\nTherefore, the data availability problem introduces the key question; how can we be sure that the block proposer is not acting maliciously?\n\nCurrently, the only way to ensure that a *data withholding* attack is not occurring is to download the full block. It is, as Satoshi said in the Bitcoin white-paper, “the only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions.” **However, this creates a bottleneck for scalability as nodes can’t verify larger blocks without significantly increasing the hardware requirements.** Higher TPS requires larger blocks since each transaction consumes data and processing power (to validate/execute). Thus, a solution that allows for larger blocks without increasing hardware requirements is imperative for scalability.\n\nTo date, increasing block sizes has been considered the only viable solution for increasing throughput, but the purpose of this article is to outline the evolution of blockchain architectures that have unlocked new answers to the data availability problem without sacrificing decentralisation or user-sovereignty.\n\n### Four key blockchain components\n\nTo understand this further and tackle this question holistically, we must first understand the four core functions of a blockchain - Execution, Settlement, Consensus, and Data availability.\n\n* *Execution* is the layer where applications live and state is updated.\n* *Settlement* is where execution layers verify proofs, resolve disputes, and transfer assets between execution layers.\n* *Consensus* is where nodes agree on the order of transactions included in a block\n* *Data availability* is making sure that the transaction data is available to users and block producers (consensus nodes).\n\n### Monolithic vs. Modular architecture blockchains\n\n![A visual representation of Monolithic vs. Modular blockchain architecture](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vsmkZ5M8_yw3VWcZcY3bu.png?height=6251&width=12501)\n\nTraditionally, blockchain architecture has relied upon these four concepts to coalesce on the same layer which has been termed a *monolithic architecture*. This architecture will always have the least amount of trust assumptions, a positive outcome for users wanting to transact securely. However, there are tremendous limitations on scalability, hardware requirements, and transaction efficiency. This is because the blockchain is responsible for the four components and can’t make software optimisations to increase functionality. This is where a new paradigm has been introduced: *modular architecture*.\n\nIn contrast to monolithic architecture, modular architecture separates those four core concepts of Execution, Settlement, Consensus, and Data Availability, and in so doing allows for greater scalability of the blockchain’s capabilities. In separating the four layers, it allows them to be specialised for intended purposes, which increases efficiency whilst still having minimal trust assumptions.\n\nThe narrative and wide-ranging support for modular architectures has developed traction over the first half of 2022. While Rollups, both Optimistic (Arbitrum, Optimism and Metis) and Zero-Knowledge (Starkware, Loopring, AZTEC and zkSync) are in fact modular execution environments, they have mostly not been marketed as such. The recent uptick in support has largely been catalysed by Celestia, which this article will explore in detail. However, it’s important to note that the modular architecture narrative has long been foundational to the data availability discourse.\n\n### A brief history:\n\nBitcoin was the first blockchain, and thus, the first to encounter the data availability problem. Mastercoin, a Bitcoin sidechain that ICO’d in 2013 attempted to use Bitcoin as a data availability layer (DAL) and consensus layer (CL). Rather than needing to bootstrap its own secure consensus by Proof of Work (Proof of Stake was not yet developed), Mastercoin utilized Bitcoin’s already extensive support network of users and their full nodes. Hailed as the Meta-Protocol, by bringing features such as token swaps and betting markets to Bitcoin, Mastercoin hoped to provide the first proof of concept to expand upon Bitcoin’s capabilities. At the technical level this was achieved by allowing transactions to be executed on the Mastercoin sidechain, flagged, and then sent back to Bitcoin, which was used as a Data availability layer (DAL). This is the first example of a sidechain/L2 with a modular philosophy, with extensible features that doesn't require L1 governance/hard forks. Mastercoin was dubbed the original Altcoin, but ultimately it failed.\n\nThe reason for Mastercoin’s failure remains an ongoing debate. One often cited reason is the protocol architecture failures, such as low liquidity for tokens issued via the platform due to the absence of AMMs. Hostility from Bitcoin core developers, leading to a price increase in data blobs is also often cited as a contributor to Mastercoin’s downfall.\n\nOne thing that is clear, however, is that Mastercoin was difficult to run a light-client on. It required users to run full nodes of both Mastercoin and Bitcoin in order to verify the integrity of Mastercoin blocks, and thus the validity of Mastercoin transactions. This immediately isolated Mastercoin users from the established ecosystem of lightclients and wallets that Bitcoin had developed at that stage.\n\nEthereum was born out of the idea of a world computer, evolving the initial idea of Bitcoin by allowing decentralized applications to be built on top through being Turing complete. The four core functions were coupled (monolithic architecture), and inextricably linked to ensure maximum security for users. The downside, however, is that this was paramount to the enormous spike in Ethereum gas fees as user adoption increased. Rollups offered a paradigm shift as they welcomed modular execution layers, and radically reduced gas fees for their users (though they won't over the long-term without further innovation). Ethereum’s long term roadmap prepares to implement data-shards to reduce gas fees and maintain its superlative security characteristics. The optimal end state of these shards remains debated by the Ethereum community, but there is general agreement on what the first step will look like.\n\n### A brief look at the future of Blockchain architecture:\n\n***Proto-danksharding***\n\nThe first step to facilitating data shards will most likely be through EIP-4844 proto-danksharding, which was introduced by Ethereum foundation researcher Dankrad Feist. In proto-danksharding, the spec is to implement most of the logic (transaction formats, verification rules) that make up the full spec, however, it will not allow for *actual* sharding. The main feature being introduced will be *blob-carrying transactions*. Blobs are extremely large (125kB) and can be much cheaper than Calldata (the benefits of this compared to just making calldata cheaper is with regards to average load and worst case load).\n\nIf you’re interested in the development and nature of sharding on Ethereum, [read this](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/proto_danksharding_faq): \n\n[https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844)\n\n### A new future for Modular blockchains?\n\nThus far, this article has focused on more traditional blockchain systems in order to provide adequate context for the variable architectural frameworks currently in use. However, it is worth noting that much of the recent conversation around modularity and data availability has been credited to the following that [Celestia](https://celestia.org/) has attracted over the course of 2022.\n\nCelestia is a modular blockchain that provides data availability and consensus. By only being responsible for these two functions, Celestia can make specifications that optimize for these environments. This leads to creating a more scalable DAL and CL. Essentially, Celestia is responsible for two things, making sure the data is available and that it is in the correct order. \n\nCelestia enables data availability via its novel proofs known as data availability proofs (DAP). These proofs use erasure codes, which is a method of data protection that ensures that if you lose a piece of data, that you will be able to recover it. The proofs require each light-node to sample a very small number of random chunks from each block in the chain, and only work if there are enough clients in the network to ensure the entire block is sampled. This means the more clients you have, the greater the possible block size you can have in a secured system. In addition, the elegance of this is that it is also incredibly easy to operate a light-client in Celestia. So easy, in fact, that you could run one on your phone, making Celestia incredibly hardware friendly. Vastly lowering the barrier to entry for running a light-client, Celestia becomes hyper-scalable, as scalability = TPS / cost to check the block, not just TPS.  \n\nSo Celestia is a layer for data availability and consensus, so what about the other components of the blockchain? For the most part, three different types of rollups will plug-in to Celestia. The first being Celestiums, which are Ethereum rollups that use Celestia for DA.  Celestiums can handle  higher transaction throughput, but it’s worth noting that doing so will make slight to moderate security trade-offs. A sovereign rollup is the second kind, this is mostly just a rollup that we see on Ethereum, however, the sovereign rollup does not need to gain permission to fork and push upgrades. The last type is a settlement rollup, which is an environment that is highly optimised for execution layers to post their transaction prior to the transaction settling and being sent down to Celestia.\n\nTo learn more about Celestia, start here: <https://celestia.org/learn/>\n\n### Conclusion\n\nData availability has long been an issue limiting the scalability of blockchains to date. Via breaking down the traditional blockchain stack, and becoming more modular, DALs are able to optimise their function such that it can provide maximal security without introducing additional trust assumptions. The future is bright for both Ethereum and Celestia, who among many others are introducing new mechanisms to solve for data availability whilst still ensuring users maintain security, sovereignty, and inexpensive transaction costs. Modular blockchains an innovative frontier for the industry, and we look forward to supporting those ecosystems as they continue to grow.

Summoners \n Summoners团队成员是运营代表，负责围绕Mages的批准、指导和法律监督、财务、为协调相关任务提供服务。 运营代表不一定是成员。Summoners的任务包括但不限于： \n l 协调 \n ü 确保所有其他 DAO 成员了解提案 \n ü 确保参与标准得到执行 \n ü 发起或鼓励对低于最低参与度的成员提出的愤怒的提议 \n ü 管理通知机制，确保 DAO 成员及时收到未决提案投票的通知以便参与 \n l 代表DAO签订经批准的法律合同 \n l 对DAO的链下资金/资产采取批准的行为 \n l 招聘外部会计师、律师等服务提供者。 \n l 协调DAO的公共关系 \n l 采取注册DAO的链下财产行动（如果有） \n **讨论社区:** \n https://discord.com/invite/c4HqXp9JnV\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yI0a45YBgDW45vDfgos8S.png?height=283&width=796)\n\n**资助计划 \n 资助计划详情**： \n 在过去的两年中，他们也一直在努力搭建桥梁并培养高度一致的项目和团队社区——构成了 MetaCartel 的周边社区。 \n 资助计划:https://www.metacartel.org/grants \n 资助申请表： \n https://forum.metacartel.org/t/guide-how-to-post-a-funding-proposal/74 \n 资助情况: \n I轮:https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-dao-wave-1-funding-9e2beb1fcd8e \n II轮:https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-dao-funding-wave-ii-c626d49830aa \n I & II轮: \n https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-dao-wave-i-ii-progress-and-outcomes-cohort-0-c0360a5da072 \n III轮:https://medium.com/metacartel/metacartel-cohort-1-6336cdca05db \n 资助项目:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XPPyaVWzcnvICOpTaDfoC.png?height=601&width=432)\n\n# 链上治理\n\n**链上治理详细机制：** \n Moloch DAO v2 智能合约标准具有以下几个特点，非常适合促进 MCV 的社区治理目标： \n 1、会员权限： \n l 允许入会： \n MCV 的会员资格是一个经过许可的过程，反映了 MCV 现有会员资格的智慧。在链上提交新成员提案并进行投票之前，候选人必须首先得到 MCV 现有成员的支持，并接受内部成员驱动的评估，其中考虑其成员资格的各个方面：文化契合度、专业知识、法律可行性等。 \n l 许可续会资格和社区监管： \n 一个人要继续成为 MCV 的成员，该人必须默示获得 MCV 成员的多数同意。任何成员都可以随时提议将另一名成员从 DAO 中除名，如果该提议得到足够多的成员的批准，该人将失去其 MCV 份额和治理权，同时收到支付代币和索赔代币，代表成员根据Grimoire有权获得的 MCV 财产的百分比。 \n 2、会员退/减免权限： \n Moloch DAO v2 智能合约体现了“选择加入”和自主选择的密码朋克设计原则，因此退出 DAO 变得尽可能容易、去信任和经济上无风险。因此，MCV 的成员可以在任何时间对成员的全部或任何部分股份进行RageQuit，并接收根据Grimoire成员有权获得的 MCV 财产百分比的付款代币和索赔代币。 \n 链上治理范围和关键参与者 \n 1、会员权益概述 \n Mages和 Goblins都能够通过MCV 的 Moloch.sol 智能合约进行链上功能交互，无需许可地执行以下所有操作： \n l 提交DAO提案； \n l 对DAO提案进行投票； \n l RageQuit 并获得他们在每个 DAO 资产中的百分比权益 \n 2、投票标准 \n 提案有两种类型：普通和特殊。 \n l 普通： \n 普通提案包括入会、开除会员、向服务提供者支付费用以及对其他项目的拟议投资。普通提案完全通过 MCV的 Moloch.sol 智能合约在链上处理。 他们必须由现有成员赞助，但可以由任何人提议。提案的结果由计票的多数决定，没有法定人数要求。 \n l 特殊提案： \n 与 MCV 的元规则相关的提案，不能完全在链上处理。如果此类提案未经必要的法律手续而在链上提出并获得批准，则该提案将无效且不予兑现，并应开除负责成员。非常规提案需要获得 MCV 当时 69% 的现有股份的批准。特殊提议的示例包括在任何重大方面修改Grimoire的提议（指定的例外除外）、将 MCV 超过 50% 的投资资产出售给第三方、将 MCV 作为有限责任公司与另一个商业实体合并或收购另一个商业实体或其他组织的大部分资产或证券，或开始参与任何法律程序。 \n **提案提交概述** \n 在 Moloch v2 智能合约中，有 8 种提案类型必须通过投票和宽限期，类似于 Moloch v1，包括： \n l 入会建议 \n ü DAO 会员申请者的贡献资金托管在 Moloch.sol 智能合约中，因为他们的会员提案需要通过投票和宽限期。 \n ü 当 DAO 提案通过时，DAO 会员贡献资金从 Moloch.sol 转移到 GuildBank，在那里不可转让的会员权益将被铸造并分配给新批准的DAO 成员。 \n ü “会员”提案还可以提供加密代币（而不是股票）作为付款。从法律上讲，这些不是会员提案，而只是从 DAO 接收某些财产或服务付款的机制。 \n l 会员开除（GuildKick）提案 \n ü 可能性#1：如果该成员之前没有对任何未决的提案投过“是”（例如，正在投票或已经批准但在宽限期内），那么目标成员将立即被退出，效果如同目标成员自愿退出（例如，成员按比例收到所有 RageTokens 和 RageClaims）。 \n ü 可能性#2：如果成员对任何仍在等待中的提案投了“是”（例如，正在投票或已经批准但在宽限期内），则该成员不能立即被强制退出（出于同样的原因）我们不允许会员在相同情况下自愿退出），因此，会员被“监禁”。 \n l Jailing & Ragekick \n ü 在被监禁成员投“是”的提案被处理之前，他们被监禁并且不能对任何其他提案进行投票。从本质上讲，GuildKicked成员不再是正式成员，而是在实际收到分配之前，在一段时间内对相关的 RageToken 和 RageClaims 持有纯粹的经济主张的人。 \n ü 一旦所有相关的待处理提案都处理完毕，任何成员都可以对目标成员调用“RageKick”函数，或者被监禁的成员可以对自己调用“RageQuit”函数。任一操作都将触发向目标成员适当分配 RageTokens 和 RageClaims。 \n ü 在目标成员因接收特定 RageToken 而被列入黑名单（如上面“RageQuits”下探讨的假设）并且没有足够快地“safeRageQuit”（2 周内）的情况下，目标成员将要求 “救助”。 \n l 救助 \n ü 在公会被踢的成员监禁时间过长（超过两周），他们的“是”批准的提案已经处理，并且没有 SafeRageQuitted，则他们可能会被保释。这意味着他们的资金被“救助”到由一组受信任的成员和/或summoners控制的多重智能合约，他们在法律程序中的行为很像接收者或受托人。 Grimoire将要求这个受信任的小组努力将RageTokens 和 RageClaims 分发给退出成员。 \n l 代币白名单提案 \n l 投资建议 \n l OTC/贸易提案 \n l Rant proposals\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a9zk_i_9SRhztMqCEUnrm.png?height=418&width=747)\n\n# 技术\n\n技术和网络概述： \n Moloch DAO v2 智能合约依赖于由第三方控制的外部 ERC-20 智能合约，MCV 的意图是让 DAO 主要通过其链上智能合约管理其资产以限制管理开销，这是该协议的主要关键技术组件 DAO 是： \n l GuildBank: \n DAO 智能合约 (GuildBank.sol) 管理 DAO 的代币。这些资金用于 DAO 对其他项目的投资、向 DAO 的服务提供商付款，或用于向 RageQuit 或被开除的成员赎回会员资格。 \n l Claims 代币: \n 索赔代币合约 (ERC-1843) 是智能合约，通过特定的 ERC-20 代币分配对未来收入的索赔。索赔代币合约的实例允许 DAO 代表创收资产或非加密资产，例如尚未上线的 SAFT，以及传统公司的股权。 \n l 链下： \n 用于向服务提供商付款的链下资产保存在 LLC 的银行账户中，其公司所有权通过法律合同获得担保。 \n 主要 GitHub 存储库 \n 地址：https://github.com/metacartel \n 智能合约 \n Moloch DAO v2 智能合约\n\n# 媒体链接\n\nOfficial website:https://www.metacartel.org/ \n Medium:https://medium.com/metacartel \n Twitter:https://twitter.com/meta_cartel\n\n\n---\n\n通过 DAO，研究组织和媒体可以打破地域的限制，以社区的方式资助和生产内容。DAOrayaki将会通过DAO的形式，构建一个代表社区意志并由社区控制的功能齐全的去中心化媒体。欢迎通过文末方式提交与DAO、量子计算、星际移民、DA相关的内容，瓜分10000USDC赏金池！欢迎加入DAOrayaki社区，了解去中心化自治组织（DAO），探讨最新话题！\n\n官方网站：<https://daorayaki.org>\n\nMedia：<https://media.daorayaki.org>\n\nDiscord server: <https://discord.gg/wNUPmsGsa4>\n\nMedium: <https://medium.com/@daorayaki>\n\nEmail: [daorayaki@dorafactory.org](mailto:daorayaki@dorafactory.org)\n\nTwitter: @daorayaki_\n\n微信助手：DAOrayaki-Media \n ", "timestamp": 1653367746, "digest": "LDFyUME4lNZTAjcK4cZu4nH-9vLcaY6ljJrE00b2lpc", "contributor": "0xF22b4cE3b2d153290Be6E97CB514dEff04799AfB"}

BitDAO简介\n\nBitDAO是世界上最大的DAO之一，由Peter Thiel, Founders Fund, Pantera, Dragonfly等支持。Bybit已承诺向BitDAO金库提供经常性捐款，以2021年的利率计算，每年超过10亿美元，其愿景是通过DeFI技术实现开放金融和去中心化的代币化经济。因此，BitDAO依托于DeFi的成功，并将分配大量的财务和人才资源来支持DeFi的发展。\n\n# 背景\n\nDeFi技术允许在区块链上进行不可阻挡且无许可的金融交易，包括交易、借贷和合成资产的创建。由于没有注册流程，没有中间商批准，没有中间商执行，DeFi将从根本上颠覆传统金融，并可能成为一个万亿美元的行业。代币化扩大了产权范围，为DAO、可收藏NFT和游戏提供了新的经济模式。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-p30HAhMH0fbLOtGsTu-U.png?height=422&width=936)\n\nBitDAO将自己定位为世界上最大的DAO之一，其愿景是开放金融和去中心化的代币化经济。它是一个贡献者的集合。随着时间的推移，社区领袖会出现。BitDAO的愿景和使命将由代币持有人、贡献者和社区领袖来推动。\n\n简单来说，DAO通过区块链和智能合约发起提案，协调成员行动和资源。成员可以通过投票对提案进行表决。他们持有的代币越多，投票权就越大。如今，DAO（Decentralized Autonomous Organization）也成为许多DeFi项目的重要方向，如Maker。\n\n“BitDAO是一个由BIT代币持有人控制的DAO。它不是一个公司，没有治理团队或员工。任何个人、开发团队或研发实验室都可以为BitDAO提出升级、代币交易和合作建议，BIT代币持有人将投票决定是否批准或拒绝这些建议。” BitDAO官方表示，并希望通过DAO的使用支持DeFi行业的发展，具体从三个方向努力。\n\n● 研发 – BitDAO合作伙伴将建立研发中心，开发BitDAO核心协议（治理和基金管理），开发BitDAO DeFi产品，支持DeFi合作伙伴，并为新兴DeFi项目提供孵化服务。 \n ● 流动性 – BitDAO将控制最大的资产池之一，可用于为合作伙伴协议提供流动性。BitDAO可以指导新的协议，如DEX、借贷和合成。 \n ● 资金 – BitDAO将通过拨款（如通过Gitcoin）支持区块链技术，并通过代币交易支持DeFi项目。\n\nBitDAO的普及与它背后的主要衍生品交易所Bybit的贡献是分不开的。根据公告，Bybit承诺将其未来合约交易量的0.025%作为收入贡献给BitDAo金库，并定期进行捐赠。BitDAo官方给出的估计是，年收入将超过10亿美元。经查询发现，Bybit确实按照承诺每天定期向BitDAo捐款，日均捐款金额接近400万美元，如下图所示：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QI9tn-plcf8t0zCUGu8Cf.png?height=678&width=936)\n\n平均每天的捐款为400万美元，约占收入的一半。Bybit资助BitDAo显然有自己的考虑。此前，英国金融监管局和加拿大安大略省证券委员会都禁止Bybit向其公民提供服务，ByBit随后停止了在该地区的服务。随着全球监管趋严，加密货币衍生品交易平台面临转型：一是走合规之路，迎合监管；二是通过DAO走去中心化之路。Binance选择了前者，Bybit选择了后者。从这个角度看，BIT也可以看作是Bybit的 “平台货币”。\n\n# Bybit对BitDAO的影响\n\nBitDAO的价值主要来自于Bybit的赋能，所以我们先来看看Bybit的现状。众所周知，Bybit是衍生品赛道上的一颗新星，仅次于三大交易所，并不时超越第二和第三。Bybit自身的现货功能很弱。虽然Huobi团队目前正在加紧开发，但要赶上其他交易所还有很长的路要走。BIT的现货交易也需要依赖其他交易所。另一方面，Bybit目前规模庞大，受到各国监管机构的严格关注。因此，它特别重视合规性。再加上对 \"DAO \"透明度的要求，支出需要披露。很明显，不可能看到。\n\n# 增长\n\nBitDAO希望通过代币交换和共同开发工作与项目合作，以增加社区的增长。 \n ● 交换 – BitDAO的目标是进行代币交换，并积累顶级的现有和新兴的DeFi和加密货币项目的集合。交换将使他们的利益保持一致。BitDAO将被激励支持这些伙伴项目成为类别领导者。一个优先事项是现货和衍生品DEXes。 \n ● 建设 – BitDAO旨在建设核心产品，使BitDAO或其他DAO更有效地运作，这些产品包括。 \n ● 治理套件 - 一套链上和链下产品和最佳实践。 \n ● 财务管理 – DAO能够部署和监控资产以赚取收益或启动产品。 \n ● 赠款 – BitDAO旨在为生产研究或产品的团队提供赠款，这些产品是加密货币行业的公共物品。一种可能性是匹配Gitcoin赠款。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tzTmGpevpZzJ7Uy7hbXnG.png?height=494&width=936)\n\n利益来自于合作伙伴和整个行业的成功。凭借数十亿的资产和经常性的贡献，BitDAO将继续创建伙伴关系，积累最好的DeFi资产，并建立有用的产品。然后，合作伙伴和产品将为BitDAO的金库作出贡献，创造一个复合和积累的动态。\n\n# 代币分配\n\n● 30%的BitDAO资产将由金库持有，以促进生态系统互换。 \n ● 5%将作为奖励提供给项目开始时的初始合作伙伴。 \n ● 60%的Bybit将分配给Bybit建立研发中心，以支持BitDAO，支持Bybit的发展，而这又可以帮助BitDAO基金库的发展。其中，15%的代币供应可以立即使用，其余45%的代币供应可以立即使用。供应将被锁定1年，锁定期结束后将在2年内逐步释放。\n\n# 代币锁定和释放\n\n根据BIT代币解锁规则，代币上线后有30%（30亿）的代币在流通，包括。10%的 “BitDAO Vault”，5%的 \"初始合作伙伴奖励 \"和15%的Bybit锁定资金。根据目前的价格，其目前的流通市值约为48亿美金，与XMR和FTT基本持平，超过了Pancake。\n\n# BitDAO经济模式\n\n● 代币BIT：治理代币+平台代币 \n ● 商业模式：开发defi产品，孵化defi项目，并提供流动性。 \n ● 收入来源1：Bybit利润的50%（约400万美元/天） \n ● 收入来源2：BitDAO的未来业务收入。\n\n# 治理\n\n● BitDAO由BIT代币持有者拥有和治理，以下行动只有在成功的提案和投票后才能执行。 \n ● 与现有和新兴项目进行代币交换。 \n ● 将资金分配给各种战略。 \n ● 对合作伙伴项目的流动性支持。 \n ● 对开发团队和研发中心的拨款或里程碑奖励（建立BitDAO产品，或支持合作伙伴产品）。 \n ● 对区块链技术项目、教育项目或其他区块链公共产品的资助。 \n ● 对BitDAO核心协议的更新（包括治理和财务管理功能）。\n\n# 原则\n\n● BitDAO不是一个公司。它没有一个治理团队或员工。 \n ● BitDAO是一个贡献者的集合。贡献者将持有BIT代币，并有动力使该项目获得成功。 \n ● 不同的个人和团队将提出对BitDAO协议的修改。由BIT持有人投票接受或拒绝这些建议。 \n ● 持有BIT使个人有权提交提案并进行投票。但它并不赋予将个人的意愿强加给其他贡献者的权利。 \n ● BitDAO将是一个不断发展的项目，社区领袖将随着时间的推移而出现。治理建议和论坛参与将影响项目的方向。 \n ● BitDAO的愿景和使命将由代币持有人、贡献者和社区领袖推动。\n\n# 最初的治理政策\n\nBitDAO旨在鼓励对BitDAO项目的贡献，并非所有问题都需要通过正式的治理提案。 \n 正式的BitDAO提案。 \n ● 涉及任何BitDAO财政资产的交易，包括赠与、互换、包装和抵押。 \n ● 对BitDAO核心协议的代码更新，例外情况包括安全发布。 \n 非正式的BitDAO提案。 \n ● 创建一个BitDAO附属的黑客马拉松或活动，贡献者承担费用。 \n ● 创建一个BitDAO附属的研究和开发实体，以建立产品，贡献者承担费用。\n\n# 每一个BIT都很重要\n\nBitDAO是由BIT代币持有者拥有和治理的。它的初始政策是只有在上述的成功提案和投票后才会执行行动，这同时也是在与BitDAO社区讨论后可以改变的。\n\n# 第一阶段\n\nBitDAO将利用Gnosis Safe的行业标准设置，Gnosis Snapshot链外治理，以及多签名管理员。\n\n**BitDAO金库 (Gnosis Safe)** \n BitDAO将使用Gnosis Safe来存储金库资产。Gnosis Safe通常被加密货币项目用于对以太坊地址进行多重签名控制。 \n BitDAO的主要金库合同地址是： \n https://etherscan.io/address/0x78605Df79524164911C144801f41e9811B7DB73D\n\n**治理模块（Gnosis Snapshot）** \n Gnosis Snapshot是一个链下投票聚合平台。Snapshot支持许多行业领先的区块链和DeFi项目的链外治理，如Balancer、Yearn Finance、SushiSwap、Uniswap、Bancor、The Graph和Aave。我们选择Snapshot作为链外投票汇总平台，使治理对我们的用户来说简单而透明。它是一个久经考验的解决方案，具有良好的用户界面和用户体验。 \n 基于快照的治理，通常被称为 \"软 \"治理，因为投票的结果不会自动执行 – 它需要开发和运营团队执行后续行动，并通过多重签名来执行变化。 \n BitDAO快照空间：https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth\n\n**治理代币（BIT）** \n BitDAO的治理代币，BIT，是Compound Finance的治理代币COMP的一个实例。这已经被选中，而不是标准的ERC-20代币，因为它支持1）委托投票，和2）链外投票汇总，有可能在以后的阶段转移到链上治理。 \n BIT代币合约地址是： \n https://etherscan.io/address/0x1A4b46696b2bB4794Eb3D4c26f1c55F9170fa4C5\n\n**其他治理讨论** \n 在社区的Discord和论坛中，将有一个单独的频道来讨论关于赠款、代币交换、协议路线图和治理的想法。获得足够社区支持的想法可以提交投票。社区成员可以为Snapshot起草一个软提案，从而导致正式的社区投票。这样的提案可以作为一个 \"温度测试 \"或投票，但不保证实施。这个想法需要被一个开发团队采纳，最终的代码被审核并提交，然后由多签管理员部署\n\n**委托投票** \n BIT持有人在将其投票权委托给一个地址之前，不能投票或创建提案。委托一次可以给一个地址，包括持有人自己的地址。\n\n**多重签名管理员** \n 在第一阶段，BitDAO库房（Gnosis Safe）和快照空间由一个多签名钱包管理。最初的设置是由Bybit团队提名的5个签名者中的3个。 与其他DeFi项目类似，我们将寻求社区的建议，以更广泛地分配签名密钥（例如，12个签名者中的6个）。对多签名者或规则的修改建议将通过快照建议和投票程序提交。 \n 提案和投票参数\n\n**定义** \n **快照策略** \n 定义了每个代币的投票权重。BitDAO的初始设置是1个BIT=1投票权重，所以每个BIT的投票权相等。未来的策略可能包括：将投票权重分配给xBIT或BIT-ETH LP代币，以使已经抵押、包装或提供流动性的BIT持有人保留投票权。\n\n**提案门槛** \n \"提案门槛 \"通常被定义为创建一个提案所需的投票数。在BitDAO快照空间中，这是通过视觉过滤器完成的，只显示来自BIT代币达到阈值数量用户的提案。\n\n**投票时间** \n 投票开始和投票结束之间的时间长度。\n\n**投票门槛** \n 对一项提案进行投票所需的最低票数权重（BIT代币）。如果没有达到这个最低限度，即使多数票投了赞成票，投票也是不成功的。\n\n# 第二阶段\n\nBitDAO将寻求建立一个定制的治理模块，最有可能参考链上可升级的解决方案，如Compound Governor Bravo。 \n BitDAO的附属研发中心正在为第二阶段建立一个定制的治理模块。其目的是提高BIT代币持有人的权力，并支持BitDAO未来的产品和功能。BitDAO欢迎社区在他们设计新的治理模块时提供反馈，特别是与权衡有关的反馈：例如，Gas费用、治理过程效率、链上/链下、安全、用户参与等。\n\n**关键要求** \n 可升级（可能依靠代理合同和代理模式）。 \n 链上提案和投票 \n ● 控制BitDAO治理参数（投票权重策略、提案门槛、投票门槛、投票时间） \n ● 控制未来的BitDAO产品参数（费用，阈值等） \n ● 可以被其他DAO轻松修改和利用 \n 不错的选择 \n ● 授权给多人（而不是授权给一人） \n ● 可以不通过委托进行投票 \n ● 委托X个区块（时间锁定） \n ● 对提案和投票进行单独的委托 \n ● 常见有效载荷的模板（即代币交换、授予等的可执行代码 \n 要考虑的是 \n ● 没有多重签名的备份或超控\n\n# 团队成员\n\n除了其早期合作伙伴和目前的首席运营官 \"Arby Leonian \"之外，关于BitDAO团队成员的信息并不多。 \n 推特账户: https://twitter.com/arbyleonian\n\n**BitDAO 早期合作伙伴** \n ● Peter Thiel \n ● Founders Fund \n ● Pantera Capital \n ● Dragonfly Capital \n ● Alan Howard \n ● Bybit \n ● Spartan Group \n ● SushiSwap \n ● Kain Warwick (founder of Synthetix) \n ● Polygon \n ● Jump Capital \n ● Peak Capital \n ● Amber \n ● Cambium Grove Capital \n ● Coinhako \n ● Fenbushi Capital \n ● Tembusu Partners \n ● NGC Ventures \n ● LongHash Ventures \n ● alphanonce \n ● iAngels Blockchain \n ● Univalues Associates \n ● mgnr \n ● The London & Amsterdam Trust Company Limited \n ● PreAngel \n ● Fintelics \n ● Pythagoras Investments \n ● Wemade Tree \n ● Kenetic \n ● The Brooker Group \n ● Kronos\n\n# 总结\n\n从以上内容我们可以了解到，BitDAO既是一个DAO组织，又是Bybit项目的一半。其代币BIT既是治理代币，又是Bybit的平台货币（Bybit一半的收益都捐给了BitDAO）。BitDAO是Bybit通过DAO向去中心化的转型。无论如何，Bybit已经走上了一条业内前所未有的平台货币发行之路，其未来的发展可能由BitDAO自己来探索。\n\n# 资源\n\n● BitDAO网站:

Bybit has pledged recurring contributions to the BitDAO treasury which at 2021 rates exceeds $1B per year with a vision of open finance and a decentralized tokenized economy through DeFI technology. For this reason, BitDAO is banking on the success of DeFi and will allocate massive financial and talent resources to support DeFi growth.\n\n# Background\n\nDeFi technology allows for unstoppable and permissionless financial transactions on the blockchain, including trading, lending, and creation of synthetic assets. With no signup process, no middlemen approvals, no middleman execution, DeFi will fundamentally disrupt traditional finance and is likely to become a trillion dollar sector. Tokenization has broadened the scope of property rights, and enabled new economic models for DAOs, collectible NFTs, and gaming.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gcoKPLH4gIGeXsSfczNPi.png?height=422&width=936)\n\nBitDAO positions itself as one of the largest DAOs in the world, and its vision is to open finance and a decentralized tokenized economy. It’s a collection of contributors. Overtime, community leaders will appear. BitDAO’s vision and mission will be promoted by token holders, contributors and community leaders.\n\nTo put it simply, DAO initiates proposals through blockchain and smart contracts to coordinate member actions and resources. Members can vote on proposals through voting. The more tokens they hold, the greater the voting power. Nowadays, DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) has also become an important direction for many DeFi projects such as Maker.\n\n“BitDAO is a DAO controlled by BIT token holders. It is not a company and has no management team or employees. Any individual, development team or R&D laboratory can propose upgrades, token transactions, and partnership proposals for BitDAO BIT token holders will vote to decide whether to approve or reject these proposals.” BitDAO officials said, and hope to support the development of the DeFi industry through the use of DAO, specifically working in three directions:\n\n* Research and development –– BitDAO partners will establish R&D centers, develop BitDAO core protocols (governance and fund management), develop BitDAO DeFi products, support DeFi partners, and provide incubation services for emerging DeFi projects.\n* Fluidity –– BitDAO will control one of the largest asset pools, which can be used to provide liquidity for partner agreements. BitDAO can guide new protocols, such as DEX, lending, and synthesis.\n* Funds –– BitDAO will support blockchain technology through grants (such as through Gitcoin) and support DeFi projects through token transactions.\n\nThe popularity of BitDAO is inseparable from the contribution of Bybit, the main derivatives exchange behind it. According to the announcement, Bybit promised to contribute 0.025% of its futures contract trading volume as income to BitDAo vault, and make regular donations. The official estimate given by BitDAo is that the annual revenue will exceed 1 billion US dollars. After inquiry, it was found that Bybit did make regular donations to BitDAo every day in accordance with its commitment, and the average daily donation amount was close to 4 million U.S. dollars as shown below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vo0Wq9GZ7MYEFcn-ES5Gv.png?height=678&width=936)\n\nThe average daily contribution is US$4 million, which is about half of the income. Bybit funding BitDAo obviously has its own considerations. Previously, the UK Financial Supervisory Authority and the Ontario Securities Commission of Canada both prohibited Bybit from providing services to its citizens, and ByBit subsequently ceased services in the region. With the tightening of global supervision, crypto derivatives trading platforms are facing transformation: one is to follow the path of compliance and cater to the supervision; the second is to take the path of decentralization through DAO. Binance chose the former and Bybit chose the latter. From this perspective, BIT can also be regarded as Bybit’s “platform currency”.\n\n# Bybit’s impact on BitDAO\n\nThe value of BitDAO mainly comes from Bybit empowerment, so let’s take a look at the current status of Bybit first. As we all know, Bybit is a rising star in the derivatives track, second only to the three major exchanges, and surpasses second and third from time to time. Bybit’s own spot function is weak. Although the Huobi team is currently intensively developing, there is still a long way to go to catch up with other exchanges. BIT’s spot trading also needs to rely on other exchanges. On the other hand, Bybit is currently large in size and has received strict attention from regulatory agencies in various countries. Therefore, it pays special attention to compliance. Coupled with the requirement for the transparency of the “DAO”, expenditures need to be disclosed. Obviously, it is impossible to pull offers.\n\n# Growth\n\nBitDAO looks to partner with projects through tokens swaps and co-development efforts and that is to increase the growth of the community:\n\n* Swap –– BitDAO aims to token swap and accumulate a collection of the top existing and emerging DeFi and crypto projects. Swaps will align their interests. BitDAO will be incentivized to support these partner projects to become category leaders. One priority is Spot and Derivatives DEXes.\n* Build –– BitDAO aims to build core products which enable BitDAO or other DAOs to function more effectively, these include:\n* Governance suite –– a set of on-chain and off-chain products and best practices.\n* Treasury Management –– ability for DAOs to deploy and monitor assets to earn yield or bootstrap products.\n* Grant –– BitDAO aims to provide grants to teams that produce research or products that are public goods for the crypto industry. One possibility is to match Gitcoin grants. \n The benefit comes from the success of partners and the industry as a whole. With billions in assets and recurring contributions, BitDAO will continue to create partnerships, accumulate the best DeFi assets, and build useful products. The partners and products will then contribute to the BitDAO treasury, creating a compounding and accumulation dynamic.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hxGxm7OqPsLNdgNTSNCo7.png?height=494&width=936)\n\n# Token distribution\n\n* 30% BitDAO Treasury will be held by the treasury to promote ecosystem swaps.\n* 5% will be provided as a reward to the initial partner at the start of the project.\n* 60% Bybit will be allocated to Bybit to establish an R&D center to support BitDAO and support the growth of Bybit which, in turn, can help the growth of BitDAO’s fund library. Among them, 15% of the token supply can be used immediately, and the remaining 45% of the token supply can be used immediately. The supply of licenses will be locked for 1 year and will be gradually released within 2 years after the end of the lock-up period.\n\n# Token lock-up and release\n\nAccording to the BIT token unlocking rules, 30% (3 billion) of the tokens are in circulation after the token goes online, including: 10% of the “BitDAO Vault”, 5% of the “Initial Partner Rewards” and 15% of Bybit Lock up funds. Based on the current price, its current circulating market value is about 4.8B US dollars, which is basically the same as XMR and FTT, and surpasses Pancake.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Av3zl0inf3I_gQ6_bzlJQ.png?height=492&width=936)\n\n# BitDAO economic model\n\nToken BIT: governance token + platform token \n Business model: develop defi products, incubate defi projects, and provide liquidity. \n Source of income 1: 50% of Bybit’s profit (approximately US$4 million per day) \n Source of income 2: BitDAO’s future business revenue.\n\n# Governance\n\nBitDAO is owned and governed by BIT token holders, with the following actions executed only after a successful proposal and vote:\n\n* token swaps with existing and emerging projects.\n* treasury allocation into various strategies.\n* liquidity support for partner projects.\n* grants or milestone rewards to development teams and R&D centers (to build BitDAO products, or support partner products).\n* grants to blockchain technology projects, education programs, or other blockchain public goods.\n* updates to BitDAO core protocols (including governance and treasury management functions)\n\n# Principles\n\n* BitDAO is not a company. It does not have a management team or employees.\n* BitDAO is a collection of contributors. Contributors will hold BIT tokens and are motivated to make the project a success.\n* Various individuals and teams will propose changes to the BitDAO protocol. It is up to BIT holders to vote to accept or reject these proposals.\n* Holding BIT entitles you to submit and vote on proposals. It does not entitle you to impose your will upon other contributors.\n* BitDAO will be an evolving project, and community leaders will emerge over time. Governance proposals and forum participation will affect the direction of the project.\n* The vision and mission of BitDAO will be driven by token holders, contributors, and community leaders.\n\n# Initial Governance Policies\n\nBitDAO aims to encourage contribution to the BitDAO project and not all issues need to go through formal governance proposals. \n Requires formal BitDAO proposals:\n\n* Transactions involving any BitDAO Treasury assets including grants, swaps, wrapping, and staking.\n* Code updates to BitDAO core protocols, exceptions include security releases. \n Does not require formal BitDAO proposals:\n* Creating a BitDAO affiliated hackathon or event, where the contributor covers the expense.\n* Creating a BtiDAO affiliated research & development entity to build products, where the contributor covers the expense.\n\n# Every BIT Counts\n\nBitDAO is owned and governed by BIT token holders. It’s initial policy is for the actions to be executed only after a successful proposal and vote as mentioned above, which is at the same time changeable after discussions with the BitDAO community.\n\n# Phase 1\n\nBitDAO will utilize the industry standard setup of Gnosis Safe, Gnosis Snapshot off-chain governance, and multi-sig administrators.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nZ-e1OT4QjkxAak3wTI8A.png?height=838&width=936)\n\n**BitDAO Treasury (Gnosis Safe)** \n BitDAO will use Gnosis Safe to store treasury assets. Gnosis Safe is commonly used by crypto projects for multi-sig control over an Ethereum address.\n\n* The main BitDAO treasury contract address is: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78605Df79524164911C144801f41e9811B7DB73D\n\n**Governance Module (Gnosis Snapshot)** \n Gnosis Snapshot is an off-chain vote aggregation platform. Snapshot supports off-chain governance for many industry leading blockchain and DeFi projects such as Balancer, Yearn Finance, SushiSwap, Uniswap, Bancor, The Graph, and Aave. We chose Snapshot as an off-chain vote aggregation platform to make governance simple and transparent for our users. It is a tried and true solution with a great user interface and user experience. \n Snapshot-based governance, is commonly referred to as “soft” governance as the result of the vote is not automatically implemented –– it requires a development and operations team to perform subsequent actions, and implementation of changes via a multi-sig.\n\n* BitDAO Snapshot Space: https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth\n\n**Governance Token (BIT)** \n BitDAO’s governance token, BIT, is an instance of Compound Finance’s governance token COMP. This has been selected instead of a standard ERC-20 token, as it supports 1) delegated voting, and 2) off-chain vote aggregation with the potential of moving to on-chain governance at a later phase.\n\n* The BIT token contract address is: https://etherscan.io/address/0x1A4b46696b2bB4794Eb3D4c26f1c55F9170fa4C5\n\n**Other Governance Discussions** \n In the community Discord and Forum, there will be a separate channel to discuss ideas around grants, token swaps, protocol roadmap, and governance. Ideas that garner enough community support can be submitted for voting. A community member may draft a soft proposal for Snapshot that leads to an official community vote. Such proposals act as a “temperature test” or a poll, but do not guarantee implementation. The idea needs to be adopted by a development team, with finalized code audited and submitted, then deployed by the multi-sig administrators.\n\n**Delegated Voting** \n BIT holders cannot vote or create proposals until they delegate their voting rights to an address. Delegation can be given to one address at a time, including the holder’s own address.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vGMmiyGmL11c4ayKOC2UX.png?height=418&width=936)\n\n**Multi-Sig Administrators** \n In Phase 1, BitDAO treasury (Gnosis Safe) and Snapshot Space are administered by a multi-sig wallet. The initial setup is 3 of 5 signers whom have been nominated by the Bybit Team. Similar to other DeFi projects, we will look to community suggestions to distribute the signing keys more widely (for example 6 of 12 signers). Proposed changes to multi-sig signers or rules will be submitted via Snapshot proposal and voting process. \n Proposal and Voting Parameters\n\n**Definitions \n Snapshot Strategy** \n Defines the vote weight of each token. BitDAO initial setting is 1 BIT = 1 vote weight, so each BIT has equal voting power. Future strategies may include: allocating vote weight to xBIT or BIT-ETH LP tokens to enable BIT holders who have staked, wrapped, or provided liquidity to retain voting power.\n\n**Proposal Threshold**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/95C5MZG3YMHRBMnaG8e0I.png?height=358&width=936)\n\n“Proposal Threshold” is typically defined as the number of votes required to create a proposal. In BitDAO Snapshot Space this is done through a visual filter, to only display proposals from users who have at least the threshold number of BIT tokens delegated to their address.\n\n**Vote Duration** \n The length of time between voting start and voting end.\n\n**Vote Threshold** \n The minimum number vote weight (BIT tokens) required to vote on a proposal. If this minimum is not met, the vote is unsuccessful even if the majority of votes voted yes.\n\n# Phase 2\n\nBitDAO will look to build a custom governance module, most likely referencing on-chain upgradable solutions such as Compound Governor Bravo. \n BitDAO affiliated R&D centers are working on building a custom governance module for Phase 2. The objective is to enhance the power of BIT token holders, and support BitDAO future products and functionality. BitDAO welcomes the community feedback as they design the new governance module, especially in relation to tradeoffs: eg. gas fees, governance process efficiency, onchain/off-chain, security, user participation, etc.\n\n**Key requirements**\n\n* Upgradable (probably relying on proxy contract, and proxy patterns)\n* Onchain proposal and voting\n* Control BitDAO governance parameters (vote weight strategy, proposal threshold, voting threshold, vote duration)\n* Control future BitDAO product parameters (fees, thresholds, etc.)\n* Can be easily modified and utilized by other DAOs \n **Nice to have**\n* Delegate-to-many (instead of delegate-to-one)\n* Can vote without delegating\n* Delegate for X number of blocks (time lock)\n* Separate delegation for proposal and voting\n* Templates for common payloads (i.e. executable code for token swaps, grants, etc.) \n **To be considered**\n* No multi-sig backup or override\n\n# Team members\n\nThere is not that much information about BitDAO team members except for its tremendous early partners and the current Chief Operating Officer which is “Arby Leonian”. \n Twitter Account: https://twitter.com/arbyleonian \n **BitDAO Early Partners** \n ● Peter Thiel \n ● Founders Fund \n ● Pantera Capital \n ● Dragonfly Capital \n ● Alan Howard \n ● Bybit \n ● Spartan Group \n ● SushiSwap \n ● Kain Warwick (founder of Synthetix) \n ● Polygon \n ● Jump Capital \n ● Peak Capital \n ● Amber \n ● Cambium Grove Capital \n ● Coinhako \n ● Fenbushi Capital \n ● Tembusu Partners \n ● NGC Ventures \n ● LongHash Ventures \n ● alphanonce \n ● iAngels Blockchain \n ● Univalues Associates \n ● mgnr \n ● The London & Amsterdam Trust Company Limited \n ● PreAngel \n ● Fintelics \n ● Pythagoras Investments \n ● Wemade Tree \n ● Kenetic \n ● The Brooker Group \n ● Kronos\n\n# Summarize\n\nFrom the above, we can understand that BitDAO is both a DAO organization and half of the Bybit project. Its token BIT is both a governance token and a platform currency of Bybit (half of Bybit’s proceeds are donated to BitDAO). BitDAO is Bybit’s transformation to decentralization through DAO. In any case, Bybit has embarked on an unprecedented path of platform currency release in the industry, and its future development may be explored by BitDAO itself.\n\n# Resources\n\nBitDAO website: https://www.bitdao.io/ \n BitDAO core information: https://docs.bitdao.io/ \n TLDR and Graphic Assets: notion \n Twitter: https://twitter.com/BitDAO_Official \n Discord: https://discord.gg/jTBC4BKnj7 \n Telegram: https://t.me/BitDAO_Official \n Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitDAO \n Medium: https://medium.com/bitdao \n LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitdao \n Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bitdao_official/ \n Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BitDAOOfficial/ \n Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/bitdao\n\n## Protocol Related\n\n● BIT Token: 0x1A4b46696b2bB4794Eb3D4c26f1c55F9170fa4C5 \n ● Treasury: 0x78605Df79524164911C144801f41e9811B7DB73D \n ● Snapshot Space: https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth \n ● Delegation Page: https://delegate.bitdaotools.io/ \n ● GitHub: TBD\n\n\n---\n\n通过 DAO，研究组织和媒体可以打破地域的限制，以社区的方式资助和生产内容。DAOrayaki将会通过DAO的形式，构建一个代表社区意志并由社区控制的功能齐全的去中心化媒体。欢迎通过文末方式提交与DAO、量子计算、星际移民、DA相关的内容，瓜分10000USDC赏金池！欢迎加入DAOrayaki社区，了解去中心化自治组织（DAO），探讨最新话题！\n\n官方网站：<https://daorayaki.org>\n\nMedia：<https://media.daorayaki.org>\n\nDiscord server: <https://discord.gg/wNUPmsGsa4>\n\nMedium: <https://medium.com/@daorayaki>\n\nEmail: [daorayaki@dorafactory.org](mailto:daorayaki@dorafactory.org)\n\nTwitter: @daorayaki_\n\n微信助手：DAOrayaki-Media\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LiumEgSHLM4E5E-7WZnzZ.png?height=430&width=430)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653368901, "digest": "B1rt2T1_U84uOOmue0uf9vRm11ww4FWE6OharotV3_g", "contributor": "0xF22b4cE3b2d153290Be6E97CB514dEff04799AfB"}

But it’s been on my mind in recent months — I’ve watched a new “language” emerge for the new technologies and behaviors that exist in web3, specifically with regards to the word “wallet.” More importantly, I don’t think we’re choosing the right words.\n\n[https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1517350655639183360?s=20&t=9e2JCImcwFBeZNi4Hbq2-g](https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1517350655639183360?s=20&t=9e2JCImcwFBeZNi4Hbq2-g)\n\n**The word “wallet” falls short in a few different ways.** Wallets in the traditional sense are static objects — they don’t change or adapt over time. They also don’t necessarily accumulate in value; wallets are purely storage facilities for capital, which, in turn, makes NFTs feel like capital assets. And if we want to get *really* pedantic, the word “wallet” often tricks people into thinking it holds actual funds as opposed to your keys.\n\nIt’s also important to consider how the purpose of a wallet has changed over the last few years. To date, almost all wallets have been built and designed around transactions\\*.\\* Many wallets are 3+ years old and were built solely for the purpose of buying, trading, and holding tokens. Since then, as the ecosystem has continued to expand, the purpose of the wallet has evolved. Now, we’re seeing more demand for wallets as a place to hold NFTs (see [Genesis](https://www.genesis.xyz/), [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) or [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)) and multimedia experiences (see [Glass](https://glass.xyz/), [DRAUP](https://mirror.xyz/0x76E1E457d43FC12Ec262dE85cCA410133b75f2Cc/8Bgs1hn69d7QRXDWmHHNW9S35-2zc28rkJbaJngvRPE), and [Altered State Machine](https://www.alteredstatemachine.xyz/)). Put simply, wallets are becoming a place where people want to spend time. Existing wallets will not (and, candidly, cannot) adapt to this new preference in behavior.\n\nWhen we think about how wallets — and what we call them — might continue to evolve, we can look to the factors that drove user adoption for previous wallets that reached mass scale. As a case study, MetaMask had 545,000 MAUs in July 2020. This shot up to [over 10M by August 2021](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/metamask-users-defi-ethereum-decentralized-finance-consensys-crypto-2021-8), driven by a surge of interest in “DeFi Summer,” where yield farming acted as a hook for consumers. At that time, it was an obvious choice for consumers to use MetaMask to take advantage of DeFi yields, as MetaMask was far more accessible (widely supported) than any competitor.\n\nWe can draw similarities between this example and the web3 ecosystem today. Supply of NFT projects, new yield farming opportunities, and social web3 platforms are all at an all-time high and only growing. Legacy wallets will initially consume new demand, but as the variety of applications, use cases, and behaviors expands, users (and developers) will need *integrated, verticalized wallets* that are more dynamic/supportive of leveraging on-chain provenance and transporting your digital identity across apps & chains. If this hypothesis is true, I expect to see an emergence of embedded wallets for different verticals or themes, each with their own terminology to onboard new users. Perhaps your digital fashion will be stored in a wardrobe, and you’ll show off your music NFTs by way of a discography.\n\nMy talented friend & fellow investor [Jay Drain](https://twitter.com/jay_drainjr/status/1484206427593842690?s=20) said it best: “Right now, crypto wallets look very much like inventories… in the future they will more clearly represent our digital identities by making them composable across the web.” I recommend you check out his full piece [here](https://jaydrainjr.substack.com/p/crypto-wallet?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTU4NDE2MywicG9zdF9pZCI6NDc0MDk5NDAsIl8iOiJOZUVZcyIsImlhdCI6MTY0MjY5NzI2MCwiZXhwIjoxNjQyNzAwODYwLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMjQ2NTUyIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.xwioKhWCXbZ3lhbut7SgKzAtnaWKBXbhh5hHdeEqfBM).\n\n**To use language as a mode for coming to terms with our surroundings is to accept that our language structures our experience of the world. Perhaps this — inquiring into our own linguistically-induced blind spots — is what’s really in a name, after all.**\n\n\n---\n\n*Related: [Do we see reality as it is?](https://www.ted.com/talks/donald_hoffman_do_we_see_reality_as_it_is)* \n\n*Thank you to D’Arcy Coolican, Zach Davidson, Jarrod Dicker, Brandon Jacoby, Dani Loftus, Sean Thielen-Esparza, Zach Terrell, and many others for informing my thinking on this piece.

Now, we’re seeing more demand for wallets as a place to hold NFTs (see [Genesis](https://www.genesis.xyz/), [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) or [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)) and multimedia experiences (see [Glass](https://glass.xyz/), [DRAUP](https://mirror.xyz/0x76E1E457d43FC12Ec262dE85cCA410133b75f2Cc/8Bgs1hn69d7QRXDWmHHNW9S35-2zc28rkJbaJngvRPE), and [Altered State Machine](https://www.alteredstatemachine.xyz/)). Put simply, wallets are becoming a place where people want to spend time. Existing wallets will not (and, candidly, cannot) adapt to this new preference in behavior.\n\nWhen we think about how wallets — and what we call them — might continue to evolve, we can look to the factors that drove user adoption for previous wallets that reached mass scale. As a case study, MetaMask had 545,000 MAUs in July 2020. This shot up to [over 10M by August 2021](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/metamask-users-defi-ethereum-decentralized-finance-consensys-crypto-2021-8), driven by a surge of interest in “DeFi Summer,” where yield farming acted as a hook for consumers. At that time, it was an obvious choice for consumers to use MetaMask to take advantage of DeFi yields, as MetaMask was far more accessible (widely supported) than any competitor.\n\nWe can draw similarities between this example and the web3 ecosystem today. Supply of NFT projects, new yield farming opportunities, and social web3 platforms are all at an all-time high and only growing. Legacy wallets will initially consume new demand, but as the variety of applications, use cases, and behaviors expands, users (and developers) will need *integrated, verticalized wallets* that are more dynamic/supportive of leveraging on-chain provenance and transporting your digital identity across apps & chains. If this hypothesis is true, I expect to see an emergence of embedded wallets for different verticals or themes, each with their own terminology to onboard new users. Perhaps your digital fashion will be stored in a wardrobe, and you’ll show off your music NFTs by way of a discography.\n\nMy talented friend & fellow investor [Jay Drain](https://twitter.com/jay_drainjr/status/1484206427593842690?s=20) said it best: “Right now, crypto wallets look very much like inventories… in the future they will more clearly represent our digital identities by making them composable across the web.” I recommend you check out his full piece [here](https://jaydrainjr.substack.com/p/crypto-wallet?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTU4NDE2MywicG9zdF9pZCI6NDc0MDk5NDAsIl8iOiJOZUVZcyIsImlhdCI6MTY0MjY5NzI2MCwiZXhwIjoxNjQyNzAwODYwLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMjQ2NTUyIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.xwioKhWCXbZ3lhbut7SgKzAtnaWKBXbhh5hHdeEqfBM).\n\n**To use language as a mode for coming to terms with our surroundings is to accept that our language structures our experience of the world. Perhaps this — inquiring into our own linguistically-induced blind spots — is what’s really in a name, after all.**\n\n\n---\n\n*Related: [Do we see reality as it is?](https://www.ted.com/talks/donald_hoffman_do_we_see_reality_as_it_is)* \n\n*Thank you to D’Arcy Coolican, Zach Davidson, Jarrod Dicker, Brandon Jacoby, Dani Loftus, Sean Thielen-Esparza, Zach Terrell, and many others for informing my thinking on this piece.

It would’ve been a crime not to. But the night turns into morning and we are feeling a hangover worse than ever before.\n\nWelcome to this month’s episode: **Markets**.\n\nIt’s no surprise purchasing power is decreasing, public equities are taking a beating, and consumer debt levels are looking unstable. Though, in the face of all this, in the words of Brad Gerstner, “technology’s value creation and positive impact on humanity has never been steeper - but wars and economic cycles remain… Embrace the first, but survive the second.”\n\nWe’ve got a lot to unpack today. Let’s begin.\n\n**Value Creation of a Country**\n\nEvery year the United States measures its **value** by calculating the total goods and services produced by the country, formally known as **gross domestic product (GDP)**. When new capital is introduced into the system, its intended purpose is to ultimately ***create more goods and services***. For the sake of today’s conversation, I took into account the amount of money printed by the federal reserve and analyzed whether it had a meaningful impact on America’s GDP. ***The results of this observation unveiled a misuse of capital, and unfortunately, a dark, but unsurprising truth that begins to explain the current market downturn.***\n\n**Money Supply vs. GDP**\n\nThese past two years, the fed printed an insane amount of money. The chart below indicates the steep rise in M2 money supply - the total volume of currency held by the public.\n\n![5-Yr U.S. M2 Money Supply Chart](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ldr9Uhob4rVDsN5g0vUid.png?height=894&width=1706)\n\nThe purpose of releasing this capital into the hands of the public was to “stimulate” the economy. The best measure of economic stimulus and health is GDP. Charted below.\n\n![5-Yr U.S. GDP](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OxNCp43CTp4qD9fsUZFFW.png?height=900&width=1708)\n\nGDP seemingly does go up and to the right, but if we dig into the numbers, we see a not-so-pretty picture. The quick math below comparing money supply to GDP indicates the new money created was not used productively. \n\n![GDP-to-M2 ratio](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m2bh-cWTUDDj22O-VO9Wf.png?height=264&width=708)\n\nThe goal of a country should be to maximize the market value of goods and services created as the available resources (i.e. money) to create G/S increases. Theoretically, this multiple should get higher over time, but at the very least, remain constant. For example, if you can make 5 burgers with $10, you should, at the very least, be able to make 10 burgers with $20. If this multiple trends downward, it’s safe to assume capital is not being allocated in a productive manner.\n\n**In our case, we had more resources, but did not create more value.**\n\nInstead, money flowed directly into financial assets (skipping actually creating value) and inflated the paper value of stocks. We didn’t really use the money printer to stimulate the economy. We used it to create asset bubbles.\n\n**Stock Market Correlation**\n\nIf that’s not enough to make you believe, something I read in Chamath’s most recent [annual letter](https://www.socialcapital.com/ideas/2021-annual-letter) left my mouth wide open.\n\n“*Since 2018, the correlation between the S&P 500 and M2 YoY growth was 0.92! In layman’s terms, as ‘the money printer went brrr,’ the stock market went up dollar for dollar.”*\n\nWhen the government releases capital into the system, it is meant to ***stimulate*** the economy i.e. *create new businesses, jobs, and goods and services*. Instead, capital flowed directly into **financial assets**. As a result, the paper value of stocks rose, but the actual productivity remained flat. We’re now witnessing the artificial bubble pop, and admittedly, it’s been quite painful to watch.\n\n**The Domino Effect**\n\n**Public Markets**:\n\n1. Money floods the system ***(M2 money supply goes up)***\n2. Consumers feel more wealthy and begin to purchase goods and services at a rapid rate ***(high demand)***\n3. Too many dollars chasing too few goods ***(low supply)***\n4. In response, businesses raise prices ***(inflation)***\n5. Fed increases rates to discourage borrowing and spending ***(leads to high cost of capital, but meant to cool demand and lower inflation)***\n6. Fundamental valuations fall due to higher cost of capital, higher hurdle rates stall professional investors, retail investors sell-off shares to cover the rising cost of everyday goods **(lower share prices)**\n\n**Private Markets:**\n\n1.

NFT的一种玩法.**\n\n**以下图狗群战绩:**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uqpjmxWoaDqEfet3qeJVW.png?height=1035&width=3320)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xWPVMHMYpDRHMlCMUNEnQ.png?height=460&width=961)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FhbBVaTrwLCnw8kwnZMWO.png?height=481&width=858)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IW4a9joIrLTtEVDWdC5Ow.png?height=1550&width=767)\n\n\n---\n\n## 风险提示\n\n**请一定不要用主钱包去Mint, 创建一个新钱包, 放里一些gas费用就可以了.**\n\n**如果在Mint过程中出现让你授权的就要小心, 一般只是需要签名, 不要授权.**\n\n**有一些NFT在Mint后是不能上架Opensea的, 遇到这种,要么你提前有时间去先查一下, 要么你就认了.**\n\n**如果不小心授权了. 请尽快取消授权.什么?不会取消授权?私聊我我教你.**\n\n\n---\n\n## 背景\n\n我的[Freemint](https://twitter.com/free_mint_bot) 播报[机器人](https://twitter.com/free_mint_bot)已经运行了一段时间, 每天都能打到金狗, 每天都有人问我如何Mint?\n\n**如果你还没关注, 请先关注FreeMint播报机器人推特:** [twitter.com/free_mint_bot](http://twitter.com/free_mint_bot)\n\n**然后点亮小铃铛!**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LS8jLP41NeJfyqLQozCnY.png?height=1460&width=1136)\n\n那么如何Mint呢? 如果你一直关注我: [twitter.com/zlexdl](http://twitter.com/zlexdl) ,一直学习的话, 我觉得你很轻松就能找到答案.\n\n在我发的 <<使用RSS筛选币圈有用的信息>>文章中, 教会你了如何掌握币圈的大量信息.\n\n只要简单的搜索一下关键词就能轻松找到答案, 可惜没几个人这么做吧.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/zlexdl.eth/CZR_mSfTNm0vfPdx1YDTi0zaM-X1vxeURz_f8078RrM](https://mirror.xyz/zlexdl.eth/CZR_mSfTNm0vfPdx1YDTi0zaM-X1vxeURz_f8078RrM)\n\n\n---\n\n**言归正传, 说一下如何mint, mint 有三种途径.**\n\n### 第一种: 使用官方直接mint\n\n这一种,我想大家都会吧, 如果不会的话, 那就退圈吧.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HQdjDvA1Du1dtMThePZwt.png?height=1524&width=1126)\n\n链接Metamask小狐狸, 直接点击mint按钮,如果没有售空, 并且没有限制的话,就可以mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E3qFRSXE8Ap9fkFgqbOAg.png?height=1030&width=1422)\n\n**注意:很多合约是前多少名额是免费Mint的, 这样的我的机器人也会检测出来, 不要到时候来问我为什么不是免费的你还要发呢.**\n\n\n---\n\n### 第二种: 利用合约Mint\n\n有一些人就问我, 为啥机器人发的一些mint信息没有Website啊?\n\n因为这些图狗根本就没准备Website, 都是为了捞一波就跑的.\n\n这种情况就需要我们进行合约Mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zE-C75sLppsbc1UszgHWX.png?height=1734&width=1127)\n\n点击Etherscan后的链接之后就会看到以下画面.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lw9EXCrebONr8jduejln5.png?height=1632&width=2066)\n\n每个合约都不太一样, 如果你懂开发的话, 可以去 点击Code 按钮去看看代码,\n\n当然如果你开发的话, 你就不用看这篇文章了.\n\n具体Mint 步骤\n\n**1. 点击Connect to Web3 按钮去连接Metamask小狐狸钱包.**\n\n成功之后是这样的:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oQejgwHZdYiTedqC8psX.png?height=405&width=783)\n\n**2.一般方法区都会有Mint ,FreeMint, MintTo, publicMint或是其他带有mint的方法.**\n\n点击 1.FreeMint之后, 可以看到以下画面.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TpoC9xQupn5nNSKxCWctV.png?height=499&width=504)\n\n因为是免费Mint ,所以单价输入框要输入0, 数量输入你喜欢的, 但是这个经常会有限制, 有的是每个地址只能mint一个, 有的是每个地址只能mint10个, 每个合约都不太一样.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qaGBxKfjvAMsOV-orEUQ1.png?height=581&width=676)\n\n**3. 输入好之后点击Write按钮就可以mint了, 如果符合各种条件就会成功的.**\n\n但是当出现以下画面时就放弃吧, 如果你钱多可以给直接发给我.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PHnHgNn18ej8y-fasJ2pP.png?height=382&width=500)\n\n另外: 当你不知道哪个方法是可以mint的呢, 例如以下这个合约的方法, 找不出合适的mint方法\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rApKQ1jIsYFX6eUQAxB4R.png?height=1136&width=515)\n\n你就可以Transactions页面看看其他人都用什么方法.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NwaW7wyn2S7EDhhQd96LR.png?height=905&width=976)\n\n然后会再回到刚才的方法页面去试试, 就可以了.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/W0E0AJLSe_b2uyFnlJ3Wq.png?height=1038&width=1068)\n\n\n---\n\n### 第三种: 跟单Mint\n\n跟单Mint也叫十六进位数据Mint.\n\n就是使用其他人已经Mint的Input Data(十六进位数据)去mint.\n\n**准备工作:**\n\nMetamask小狐狸的【设置】-【高级】-【显示十六进制数据】点击成**启用**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wlvdOsj43Wwli2VQiUVcj.png?height=909&width=551)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gUbOTu_AQy_yFWtZwnBUz.png?height=903&width=553)\n\n在第二种方法已经说了, 先去Transactions页面去看其他人的传输记录.\n\n**去Transactions页面找到近期已经成功Mint并且Value为0的传输, 点击进去**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gywPQUMMi9tLclSPx62_c.png?height=960&width=2068)\n\n可以看出这个记录mint了4个, 那么你如果使用他Input data也会mint4个的, 这点需要注意.\n\n当然也不是没有办法修改的, 但是需要时间, 等你改完了就来不及了, 反正都是免费的.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BXLchbA72CX-RPHJCGja3.png?height=1682&width=1606)\n\n点击上图中左下角的 **Click to see More** 按钮后, 点击**View Input AS**后选择**Original**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/siHeRkhE72bAxmK2KvMHj.png?height=1047&width=1466)\n\n复制红框中的字符串\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3YG3HbQhlReGP53Thr1eB.png?height=396&width=1571)\n\n一定是项目合约地址，不是项目方地址, 千万别选错了,要不然就浪费gas了.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pKWxTzKQP1E-r-OmGj317.png?height=858&width=1357)\n\n这个也是合约地址.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y6gl5P0YYuqc4K5LuKwNx.png?height=154&width=959)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6dhWEFPFh8Bq6v-tWFHnC.png?height=1608&width=636)\n\nMatamask小狐狸钱包的主界面点击 发送 按钮就会出现以上画面\n\n分别输入合约地址, 0数额, 刚才取得的十六进制数据, 然后点击下一步就可以Mint了.\n\n**补充: 十六进位数据Mint有三种, 上面的是第一种, 直接拿到Input Data去mint**\n\n**第二种是需要把Input data中一部分字符串修改成自己的地址(不代0x).**\n\n感谢 [twitter.com/yuzijun0902](http://twitter.com/yuzijun0902) 和图狗群的 **猫** 提供的信息\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BZR2B3m5bDE6YaE_eltyS.png?height=1724&width=1883)\n\n**第三种Input data是一堆乱码, 无法mint**\n\n\n---\n\n## 关于如何找到金狗\n\n说实话这个是很难的, 如果大家都能确定是金狗, 就都发财了.\n\n但是金狗还是有一定特征的,\n\n**一般可以看看总供应量, 供应量少的概率大一些.**\n\n**可以看看社区, 推特的关注量, Discord的公告, 很多项目因为进入了熊市就把原定付费Mint的改成了免费Mint, 例如凯撒猿, 魔女pass卡等等.**\n\n以后我会在机器人里追加一些相关信息, 例如**NFT的供应量**, **推特的关注人数**之类的信息, 还有接下来的\\*\\*自动Mint,\\*\\*都会去开发.\n\n**而且还会提供微信推送服务.**\n\n**如果你们打到金狗, 吃水不忘挖井人, 可以给我打个赏.**\n\n**打赏之后别忘记推特上私信联系我, 以后如果有收费项目,或是微信推送服务,

{"id": "PyueYoODCk4dGEIaaaSIgelSdQAroxJAwGfMxyyaRe8", "title": "UI Feedback", "body": "As a frequent user and a manager of a snapshot space from a small community, I’m very pleased to see my previous suggestions are being realized gradually by the amazing team and how snapshot keeps contributing to the success of DAO governance.\n\nFrom the times I can tell, it’s getting better and better in its **optimized creation flow**, **new** **quick access sidebars**, **notification dropdown**, **enhanced hovertips** and my favorite **personal profile** feature showing one’s voting history that I’ve never expected to launch this soon!\n\nI want to write this feedback as a follow-up of what I’ve submitted earlier this year before, from the voice of a long-term user, and also from my community members, sincerely wish these ideas will get snapshot better in the coming future.🌟\n\n\n---\n\n### 1. Add a voting status in the proposals page\n\nThe counter in the right corner of a space shows the number of proposals that have recently entered into the active state, so I guess it’s not possible to make them disappear once a voter casts all the existing votes.\n\nHowever, is it possible to doing a workaround by adding a voter’s voting record at the bottom of **an active proposal item**, just like the “majority choice“ of a closed proposal, indicating that the user has voted this proposal. It can simply be a similar version of what’s inside the proposals votes list.\n\nIt will be of a great help since we often encounter situations where we have to load a series of proposals at consecutive intervals, and members may forget to pick each one of them or double vote on the same proposal since they can’t just remember each of their voting behavior in such situations. By enabling this improvents, people won’t need to click in to check their status, this helps much in governance efficiency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DC62Iu5BytfCmRcjGa5P0.png?height=369&width=835)\n\n### 2. Default starting time to “Now” when duplicating a proposal\n\nIn most cases, we don’t duplicate a proposal simply because of a typo or something like that. Rather, it’s when we find a mistake in our strategy or the proposal doesn’t meet our quorum due to special reasons, we have to do so since once the proposal is posted, it becomes immutable and we can’t revoke it.\n\nMost importantly, the snapshot of the proposal is based on the creation time of itself, not the starting time we set. It doesn’t make a lot of sense that the duplicated proposal still inherits the previous one, especially a very old one with which date we will just **post a closed state** **of proposal** at the current time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6u5JQMRNfqZutZ_lc2Uc.png?height=173&width=758)\n\n### 3. Unify the interaction dynamics on the creation process\n\nIt’s a typical thing mentioned by our authors, that sometimes they just cannot find the “Back“ button to navigate to the last page.\n\nWe found out that most likely it’s because of **the inconsistency** of the backward logic.\n\nThe current creation process is split into 2 pages: the main body of proposal, and the Choice form. While the interface has a different logic in these 2 consecutive pages, it can create kind of loss in user’s consciousness.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we should **add the “←Back“ button** to each of the creation page to bridge that inconsistency.\n\n![Inconsistency: Proposal Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0DX2Kw1zvXa3zZIu9cvTa.png?height=180&width=1253)\n\n![Inconsistency: Choice Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyODQDIYrVLQE9ycTV0Xm.png?height=203&width=1228)\n\n### 4. Integrate notification bells into one within the app\n\nI noticed that Snapshot now has a full list of notification methods we can choose from: HAL, discord bot, epns, webhooks… The notification bell within the space page seems a little outdated, and our members are often confused at what these two bells represent for respectively.\n\nIt spent me a while to get to understand that they actually control different ways of notification, but this also creates a sort of fragmentation within UI. Imagining one wants to turn off notification messages from a specific space he joins in the upper right dropdown list, there’s no way to do so, and the bell below the space name won’t work either, but to switch to another notifiation type.\n\nIMHO, we can make this page much neater by **integrating** the left notication bell with the newer one, and after that it will only point to one type of notification where user can actually control to accept a specific range of space messages.\n\n![two similar bells](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ujtOy7j3fj90TsTHabvT.png?height=426&width=1355)\n\n### 5. Highlight voting types\n\nPastachiodao is a very good example that I use it every time when I try to teach new members who are going to cast their fist votes.\n\nBut sometimes when new members flood in, it’s inevitable someone doesn’t fully comprehend the meaning of the voting system or just neglect the voting type the proposal is using since it’s just placed in the upper right corner of the page.\n\nI’m thinking of a way just like what Pastachiodao did. But differently I want the ‘‘demo’’ directly embedded within a proposal in the simple form like **a short explained hint**, to remind the users which voting type they are acting on, to let them know they can actually choose one more options in an “approval voting” type. I can’t help thinking it because it would be a great attempt to further ‘‘educate’’ our users the knowledge of snapshot in a very practical way.\n\nIt can be in the choice form section **beside ‘“cast your vote“**, indicating a voting type.\n\n![a hint beside \"Cast your vote\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6N3uMa5G1q-rVr39Sqzt.png?height=421&width=790)\n\n### 6. Make visible the bottom bar in the homepage\n\nThe bottom bar provides essential information like official contact, display mode, language setting and official tutorials.\n\nThese elements are highly useful and should be **available at anytime** at least in the homepage. (experience from other well-known projects)\n\nHowever, if one hits the “load more” button, it just keeps loading down forever until all spaces will show up, and the bottom bar containing these information just keep **“blipping“** on each loading. One has to refresh the page to get it back to the original state.\n\nTo keep the bottom bar at a certain visibility level, I can think of 3 options:\n\n1. Pin the bottom bar like “freeze panes” in an excel, so loading will not break its existence.\n2. Add a load limit, like 50 spaces/load, after that, one has to retrigger the load manually.\n3. Keep it as it was. But after one hits the “load more” button and the load starts looping, one will be able to return back the state by hitting “snapshot“ in the top bar or “⚡“ in the sidebar.\n\n![Blip on each \"load more\"...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fTeNuFG5QZzzfxItSeGXw.png?height=219&width=1273)\n\n### 7.  Optimize the experience of edit box\n\nWe usually tweak our strategies in the UI, its original edit box. But the experience is not good, especially for a long code, every time an input will **bring the whole page to the top**, again and again, it brings us headache since we just **lost** where we were in the middle of job. I believe the issue also happens in any edit box like a plugin modal, or the playground…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DokWdmd9oj0EsZkKiZ7k.png?height=680&width=562)\n\n### 8. Strategy reuse\n\nFor different proposal types, we have different strategies to apply.\n\nWe know snapshot doesn’t allow the author to choose arbitrary strategies at his will. We successfully manage it at the admin level, to centralize the use of strategies.\n\nBut as such, we’re also considering for a DAO which has a pool of 10 strategies (and we use it on rotation like 3-4 strategies a time), if we can make things more efficient by keeping those **strategies temporarily not in use** in an “**inactive state”** rather than just deleting them and re-adding them back when it comes to use again?\n\nTherefore we don’t bother to write them again and can bring them back with just a click, which provides much more flexibility.\n\n![Adding a disable button besides delete?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0E6joStNfYGl_uYNbV-Zp.png?height=402&width=771)\n\n### 9. Preserve the input state of the keywords on strategies section\n\nThe number of snapshot’s strategies is exploding, which is good! However sometimes we can hardly tell the exact function of a strategy by its name and have to click in and run a test one by one.\n\nIt’s somewhat inconvenient when we click the return button, and it brings us to the whole list of strategy after we find out it’s not our strategy, we have to **input the keywords  again** to filter to the target lists.\n\nI wish the app can remember the state of our input keywords when we return to the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LWmGGniXeLhjlpBO-Pid6.png?height=290&width=1306)\n\nThanks for reading all the way through, hereby I give my best wishes to snapshot’s future as well as my community！❤", "timestamp": 1653370209, "digest": "XUFYktLBZvMnbNVihV84Iq0xq0hafZ_Rl8FbbO8uIKc", "contributor": "0x4F777E46C37fc4a2f70FdFB3a0A7C56C93EE82F0"}
{"id": "T0jjknvkEIzve3ZkFkSd3swjIftWmnkxOjk3_wDVYH0", "title": "Understanding the foundations of DeFi", "body": "DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance. Right now, you probably use TradFi or traditional financial systems (AKA Centralized finance/CeFi or Legacy Finance) to do things with your money. Storing your funds in a checking account with a bank, using a card to access that money, and taking out loans are all services offered by TradFi banking institutions. DeFi is a new paradigm in managing money via internet protocols and giving people all over the world access to financial services.\n\nDeFi uses Cryptocurrency and Blockchain technologies. The Blockchain keeps everything secure and makes sure the only person that can access your money is YOU. If you’ve never heard the word blockchain or you’re still learning more about it, then check out my upcoming piece: What is the Blockchain, and how the heck does it work?\n\nTo make it easy to understand the differences between DeFi and TradFi, let’s use some examples.\n\nI have a friend in the US, Naomi, and she has a friend in Finland, Johan. Naomi is sending Johan money because he designed a cool graphic for her to use on her business logo. Using TradFi, Naomi would have to send money from her bank to his bank using an international transfer. Her bank charges a percentage of the amount sent as a fee to perform this transaction and tells her that the transfer will take 5 business days to go through. Naomi does it because she needs to send Johan money for the awesome work he did. She is sad that she had to pay the fee and that it takes so long, but she doesn’t know of another way to reliably send money across the world.\n\nEnter DeFi. With DeFi, Naomi can use her Ethereum Cryptocurrency wallet to transfer as much money to Johan as she would like (*the Ethereum blockchain uses Ether/ETH as its native currency*), and it arrives in his wallet within minutes because it is all done over the internet. She doesn’t have to wait 5 days, she doesn’t have to rely on the banks because it’s all done with computer code, and they are both sure that the transaction was completed thanks to the consensus of the Ethereum Blockchain!\n\nThis is a huge improvement when it comes to transferring value from one person to another. Let’s look at another example of what DeFi can do.\n\nNaomi wants to invest more money into her business to help it grow. She has a house, 100 shares in a major tech company, and 50 ETH, but she doesn’t want to sell any of those because she believes they will all continue to grow in value over time. She really wants to grow her business, so she decides to take out a loan and use her assets to secure it. She goes to her bank on a weekday during banking hours and waits in line to speak with a banker that can help her complete the paperwork. She fills out a loan application and uses her house as collateral. After waiting 3 business days she finally receives confirmation that her application was accepted with an APR of 9%, and the loan will be deposited into her checking account after 2 more business days. She wished she didn’t have to wait so long and go through so much hassle to get the loan, but she really wants to invest more in her business, and this is the only option.\n\nEnter DeFi. With DeFi, Naomi can go to a lending protocol and deposit her ETH as collateral in the lending pool. With her ETH in the protocol, she earns an APR for as long as it’s held there. With her ETH deposited as collateral, she can also take out a loan. She chooses the amount she would like to borrow based on how much ETH she deposited (up to 65-75% of the value of her ETH usually) and confirms the loan. Within minutes, she has the loan amount deposited in her Crypto wallet. No waiting in line, scheduling a long lunch to get to the bank during business hours, or paperwork required.\n\nPerforming this process in DeFi is far easier and less time consuming than it is in TradFi. That’s why DeFi is quickly becoming used by people across the world. There is a much smaller barrier to entry than TradFi because all you need is an internet connection. DeFi has started to show that though TradFi is powerful, it has become too large, too deeply rooted within the nation-states (AKA countries) in which it is used, and very inefficient.\n\nNow, this is not intended to disparage these systems, because they have all been integral in the growth of society and its ability to bring incredible innovations to the people of the world. The purpose here is to highlight why these systems have become less effective, and the need for a revolution that allows financial services to experience the exponential innovation that the internet has already brought to countless other industries.\n\nTradFi is built on top of the central banks of the world. When a nation-state wants to issue its own currency to the people that live within its borders, they need a way to control the release and management of this money. So, many of them create a central bank to be responsible for all of this. That government and central bank then start to make rules and standards for how this money is to operate. For a long time, this worked well for most nation-states. They had their currency, governed it how they liked, chose what it can and can’t do, and most people who lived there never needed to do things that the banks had not yet made possible.\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, the world became much more accessible to the average person, and people were doing things that founding central bankers never dreamed would be possible. Then, the internet was born, which eventually lead to the breakthrough of digital scarcity (which is the ability for something to be 100% digital but also have provable scarcity with the blockchain i.e., cryptocurrencies).\n\nNow, we have all this amazing technological innovation pushing society forward, but we still use TradFi services where banks fax paper copies of documents and must wait for people to be working in the office for a transfer to post to your account. There wasn’t a better system for a long time, but now there is.\n\nThis is why we need DeFi. Take Naomi from earlier: there are so many more amazing things that she can do with DeFi that make her current bank account look like a dusty old typewriter. We didn’t even scratch the surface with those 2 examples. This technology is revolutionizing how people access financial services. It’s a worldwide ecosystem that doesn’t exclude anyone, no matter how much money they have or if banking companies are present where they live in the world.\n\nDeFi is changing how we approach finance, and we’ve only covered the basics here, but I hope you’ve started to understand what DeFi is and why it can change how the world uses money. Here’s to bringing global financial infrastructure into the 21st century!", "timestamp": 1653370202, "digest": "aGDteGMARQhs4LDd71YOc_W7-jALWRiEOcV7nxBb1f0", "contributor": "0x2487fC7E019860AFbfC7Fb16689e421843c777E2"}

{"id": "9-iUiS0fc1E8HyKpc7nOrMQQFae4Hw1PbweG0wa99_w", "title": "UI Feedback", "body": "As a frequent user and a manager of a snapshot space from a small community, I’m very pleased to see my previous suggestions are being realized gradually by the amazing team❤️ and how snapshot keeps contributing to the success of DAO governance!\n\nFrom the times I can tell, it’s getting better and better in its **optimized creation flow**, **new** **quick access sidebars**, **notification dropdown**, **enhanced hovertips** and my favorite **personal profile** feature showing one’s voting history that I’ve never expected to launch this soon!\n\nI want to write this feedback as a follow-up of what I’ve submitted earlier this year before, from the voice of a long-term user, and also from my community members, sincerely wish these ideas will help snapshot go better in the coming future.🌟\n\n\n---\n\n### 1. Add a voting status in the proposals page\n\nThe counter in the right corner of a space shows the number of proposals that have recently entered into the active state, so I guess it’s not possible to make them disappear once a voter casts all the existing votes.\n\nHowever, is it possible to doing a workaround by adding a voter’s voting record at the bottom of **an active proposal item**, just like the “majority choice“ of a closed proposal, indicating that the user has voted this proposal. It can simply be a similar version of what’s inside the proposals votes list.\n\nIt will be of a great help since we often encounter situations where we have to load a series of proposals at consecutive intervals, and members may forget to pick each one of them or double vote on the same proposal since they can’t just remember each of their voting behavior in such situations. By enabling this improvents, people won’t need to click in to check their status, this helps much in governance efficiency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DC62Iu5BytfCmRcjGa5P0.png?height=369&width=835)\n\n### 2. Default starting time to “Now” when duplicating a proposal\n\nIn most cases, we don’t duplicate a proposal simply because of a typo or something like that. Rather, it’s when we find a mistake in our strategy or the proposal doesn’t meet our quorum due to special reasons, we have to do so since once the proposal is posted, it becomes immutable and we can’t revoke it.\n\nMost importantly, the snapshot of the proposal is based on the creation time of itself, not the starting time we set. It doesn’t make a lot of sense that the duplicated proposal still inherits the previous one, especially a very old one with which date we will just **post a closed state** **of proposal** at the current time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6u5JQMRNfqZutZ_lc2Uc.png?height=173&width=758)\n\n### 3. Unify the interaction dynamics on the creation process\n\nIt’s a typical thing mentioned by our authors, that sometimes they just cannot find the “Back“ button to navigate to the last page.\n\nWe found out that most likely it’s because of **the inconsistency** of the backward logic.\n\nThe current creation process is split into 2 pages: the main body of proposal, and the Choice form. While the interface has a different logic in these 2 consecutive pages, it can create kind of loss in user’s consciousness.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we should **add the “←Back“ button** to each of the creation page to bridge that inconsistency.\n\n![Inconsistency: Proposal Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0DX2Kw1zvXa3zZIu9cvTa.png?height=180&width=1253)\n\n![Inconsistency: Choice Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyODQDIYrVLQE9ycTV0Xm.png?height=203&width=1228)\n\n### 4. Integrate notification bells into one within the app\n\nI noticed that Snapshot now has a full list of notification methods we can choose from: HAL, discord bot, epns, webhooks… The notification bell within the space page seems a little outdated, and our members are often confused at what these two bells represent for respectively.\n\nIt spent me a while to get to understand that they actually control different ways of notification, but this also creates a sort of fragmentation within UI. Imagining one wants to turn off notification messages from a specific space he joins in the upper right dropdown list, there’s no way to do so, and the bell below the space name won’t work either, but to switch to another notifiation type.\n\nIMHO, we can make this page much neater by **integrating** the left notication bell with the newer one, and after that it will only point to one type of notification where user can actually control to accept a specific range of space messages.\n\n![two similar bells](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ujtOy7j3fj90TsTHabvT.png?height=426&width=1355)\n\n### 5. Highlight voting types\n\nPastachiodao is a very good example that I use it every time when I try to teach new members who are going to cast their fist votes.\n\nBut sometimes when new members flood in, it’s inevitable someone doesn’t fully comprehend the meaning of the voting system or just neglect the voting type the proposal is using since it’s just placed in the upper right corner of the page.\n\nI’m thinking of a way just like what Pastachiodao did. But differently I want the ‘‘demo’’ directly embedded within a proposal in the simple form like **a short explained hint**, to remind the users which voting type they are acting on, to let them know they can actually choose one more options in an “approval voting” type. I can’t help thinking it because it would be a great attempt to further ‘‘educate’’ our users the knowledge of snapshot in a very practical way.\n\nIt can be in the choice form section **beside ‘“cast your vote“**, indicating a voting type.\n\n![a hint beside \"Cast your vote\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6N3uMa5G1q-rVr39Sqzt.png?height=421&width=790)\n\n### 6. Make visible the bottom bar in the homepage\n\nThe bottom bar provides essential information like official contact, display mode, language setting and official tutorials.\n\nThese elements are highly useful and should be **available at anytime** at least in the homepage. (experience from other well-known projects)\n\nHowever, if one hits the “load more” button, it just keeps loading down forever until all spaces will show up, and the bottom bar containing these information just keep **“blipping“** on each loading. One has to refresh the page to get it back to the original state.\n\nTo keep the bottom bar at a certain visibility level, I can think of 3 options:\n\n1. Pin the bottom bar like “freeze panes” in an excel, so loading will not break its existence.\n2. Add a load limit, like 50 spaces/load, after that, one has to retrigger the load manually.\n3. Keep it as it was. But after one hits the “load more” button and the load starts looping, one will be able to return back the state by hitting “snapshot“ in the top bar or “⚡“ in the sidebar.\n\n![Blip on each \"load more\"...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fTeNuFG5QZzzfxItSeGXw.png?height=219&width=1273)\n\n### 7.  Optimize the experience of edit box\n\nWe usually tweak our strategies in the UI, its original edit box. But the experience is not good, especially for a long code, every time an input will **bring the whole page to the top**, again and again, it brings us headache since we just **lost** where we were in the middle of job. I believe the issue also happens in any edit box like a plugin modal, or the playground…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DokWdmd9oj0EsZkKiZ7k.png?height=680&width=562)\n\n### 8. Strategy reuse\n\nFor different proposal types, we have different strategies to apply.\n\nWe know snapshot doesn’t allow the author to choose arbitrary strategies at his will. We successfully manage it at the admin level, to centralize the use of strategies.\n\nBut as such, we’re also considering for a DAO which has a pool of 10 strategies (and we use it on rotation like 3-4 strategies a time), if we can make things more efficient by keeping those **strategies temporarily not in use** in an “**inactive state”** rather than just deleting them and re-adding them back when it comes to use again?\n\nTherefore we don’t bother to write them again and can bring them back with just a click, which provides much more flexibility.\n\n![Adding a disable button besides delete?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0E6joStNfYGl_uYNbV-Zp.png?height=402&width=771)\n\n### 9. Preserve the input state of the keywords on strategies section\n\nThe number of snapshot’s strategies is exploding, which is good! However sometimes we can hardly tell the exact function of a strategy by its name and have to click in and run a test one by one.\n\nIt’s somewhat inconvenient when we click the return button, and it brings us to the whole list of strategy after we find out it’s not our strategy, we have to **input the keywords  again** to filter to the target lists.\n\nI wish the app can remember the state of our input keywords when we return to the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LWmGGniXeLhjlpBO-Pid6.png?height=290&width=1306)\n\nThanks for reading all the way through, hereby I give my best wishes to snapshot’s future as well as my community！❤", "timestamp": 1653370372, "digest": "XUFYktLBZvMnbNVihV84Iq0xq0hafZ_Rl8FbbO8uIKc", "contributor": "0x4F777E46C37fc4a2f70FdFB3a0A7C56C93EE82F0"}

{"id": "-0oo_1wy3_6BI27iCrW4y9G-Oq43sHgM2yfzxx3tDM8", "title": "UI Feedback", "body": "As a frequent user and a manager of a snapshot space from a small community, I’m very pleased to see my previous suggestions are being realized gradually by the amazing team and how snapshot keeps contributing to the success of DAO governance.\n\nFrom the times I can tell, it’s getting better and better in its **optimized creation flow**, **new** **quick access sidebars**, **notification dropdown**, **enhanced hovertips** and my favorite **personal profile** feature showing one’s voting history that I’ve never expected to launch this soon!\n\nI want to write this feedback as a follow-up of what I’ve submitted earlier this year before, from the voice of a long-term user, and also from my community members, sincerely wish these ideas will help snapshot go better in the coming future.🌟\n\n\n---\n\n### 1. Add a voting status in the proposals page\n\nThe counter in the right corner of a space shows the number of proposals that have recently entered into the active state, so I guess it’s not possible to make them disappear once a voter casts all the existing votes.\n\nHowever, is it possible to doing a workaround by adding a voter’s voting record at the bottom of **an active proposal item**, just like the “majority choice“ of a closed proposal, indicating that the user has voted this proposal. It can simply be a similar version of what’s inside the proposals votes list.\n\nIt will be of a great help since we often encounter situations where we have to load a series of proposals at consecutive intervals, and members may forget to pick each one of them or double vote on the same proposal since they can’t just remember each of their voting behavior in such situations. By enabling this improvents, people won’t need to click in to check their status, this helps much in governance efficiency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DC62Iu5BytfCmRcjGa5P0.png?height=369&width=835)\n\n### 2. Default starting time to “Now” when duplicating a proposal\n\nIn most cases, we don’t duplicate a proposal simply because of a typo or something like that. Rather, it’s when we find a mistake in our strategy or the proposal doesn’t meet our quorum due to special reasons, we have to do so since once the proposal is posted, it becomes immutable and we can’t revoke it.\n\nMost importantly, the snapshot of the proposal is based on the creation time of itself, not the starting time we set. It doesn’t make a lot of sense that the duplicated proposal still inherits the previous one, especially a very old one with which date we will just **post a closed state** **of proposal** at the current time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6u5JQMRNfqZutZ_lc2Uc.png?height=173&width=758)\n\n### 3. Unify the interaction dynamics on the creation process\n\nIt’s a typical thing mentioned by our authors, that sometimes they just cannot find the “Back“ button to navigate to the last page.\n\nWe found out that most likely it’s because of **the inconsistency** of the backward logic.\n\nThe current creation process is split into 2 pages: the main body of proposal, and the Choice form. While the interface has a different logic in these 2 consecutive pages, it can create kind of loss in user’s consciousness.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we should **add the “←Back“ button** to each of the creation page to bridge that inconsistency.\n\n![Inconsistency: Proposal Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0DX2Kw1zvXa3zZIu9cvTa.png?height=180&width=1253)\n\n![Inconsistency: Choice Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyODQDIYrVLQE9ycTV0Xm.png?height=203&width=1228)\n\n### 4. Integrate notification bells into one within the app\n\nI noticed that Snapshot now has a full list of notification methods we can choose from: HAL, discord bot, epns, webhooks… The notification bell within the space page seems a little outdated, and our members are often confused at what these two bells represent for respectively.\n\nIt spent me a while to get to understand that they actually control different ways of notification, but this also creates a sort of fragmentation within UI. Imagining one wants to turn off notification messages from a specific space he joins in the upper right dropdown list, there’s no way to do so, and the bell below the space name won’t work either, but to switch to another notifiation type.\n\nIMHO, we can make this page much neater by **integrating** the left notication bell with the newer one, and after that it will only point to one type of notification where user can actually control to accept a specific range of space messages.\n\n![two similar bells](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ujtOy7j3fj90TsTHabvT.png?height=426&width=1355)\n\n### 5. Highlight voting types\n\nPastachiodao is a very good example that I use it every time when I try to teach new members who are going to cast their fist votes.\n\nBut sometimes when new members flood in, it’s inevitable someone doesn’t fully comprehend the meaning of the voting system or just neglect the voting type the proposal is using since it’s just placed in the upper right corner of the page.\n\nI’m thinking of a way just like what Pastachiodao did. But differently I want the ‘‘demo’’ directly embedded within a proposal in the simple form like **a short explained hint**, to remind the users which voting type they are acting on, to let them know they can actually choose one more options in an “approval voting” type. I can’t help thinking it because it would be a great attempt to further ‘‘educate’’ our users the knowledge of snapshot in a very practical way.\n\nIt can be in the choice form section **beside ‘“cast your vote“**, indicating a voting type.\n\n![a hint beside \"Cast your vote\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6N3uMa5G1q-rVr39Sqzt.png?height=421&width=790)\n\n### 6. Make visible the bottom bar in the homepage\n\nThe bottom bar provides essential information like official contact, display mode, language setting and official tutorials.\n\nThese elements are highly useful and should be **available at anytime** at least in the homepage. (experience from other well-known projects)\n\nHowever, if one hits the “load more” button, it just keeps loading down forever until all spaces will show up, and the bottom bar containing these information just keep **“blipping“** on each loading. One has to refresh the page to get it back to the original state.\n\nTo keep the bottom bar at a certain visibility level, I can think of 3 options:\n\n1. Pin the bottom bar like “freeze panes” in an excel, so loading will not break its existence.\n2. Add a load limit, like 50 spaces/load, after that, one has to retrigger the load manually.\n3. Keep it as it was. But after one hits the “load more” button and the load starts looping, one will be able to return back the state by hitting “snapshot“ in the top bar or “⚡“ in the sidebar.\n\n![Blip on each \"load more\"...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fTeNuFG5QZzzfxItSeGXw.png?height=219&width=1273)\n\n### 7.  Optimize the experience of edit box\n\nWe usually tweak our strategies in the UI, its original edit box. But the experience is not good, especially for a long code, every time an input will **bring the whole page to the top**, again and again, it brings us headache since we just **lost** where we were in the middle of job. I believe the issue also happens in any edit box like a plugin modal, or the playground…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DokWdmd9oj0EsZkKiZ7k.png?height=680&width=562)\n\n### 8. Strategy reuse\n\nFor different proposal types, we have different strategies to apply.\n\nWe know snapshot doesn’t allow the author to choose arbitrary strategies at his will. We successfully manage it at the admin level, to centralize the use of strategies.\n\nBut as such, we’re also considering for a DAO which has a pool of 10 strategies (and we use it on rotation like 3-4 strategies a time), if we can make things more efficient by keeping those **strategies temporarily not in use** in an “**inactive state”** rather than just deleting them and re-adding them back when it comes to use again?\n\nTherefore we don’t bother to write them again and can bring them back with just a click, which provides much more flexibility.\n\n![Adding a disable button besides delete?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0E6joStNfYGl_uYNbV-Zp.png?height=402&width=771)\n\n### 9. Preserve the input state of the keywords on strategies section\n\nThe number of snapshot’s strategies is exploding, which is good! However sometimes we can hardly tell the exact function of a strategy by its name and have to click in and run a test one by one.\n\nIt’s somewhat inconvenient when we click the return button, and it brings us to the whole list of strategy after we find out it’s not our strategy, we have to **input the keywords  again** to filter to the target lists.\n\nI wish the app can remember the state of our input keywords when we return to the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LWmGGniXeLhjlpBO-Pid6.png?height=290&width=1306)\n\nThanks for reading all the way through, hereby I give my best wishes to snapshot’s future as well as my community！❤", "timestamp": 1653371756, "digest": "XUFYktLBZvMnbNVihV84Iq0xq0hafZ_Rl8FbbO8uIKc", "contributor": "0x4F777E46C37fc4a2f70FdFB3a0A7C56C93EE82F0"}

{"id": "hXN4TG_HppwVVO2vPUpT5DlN-HrjG5pmvD7qVOriZYY", "title": "UI Feedback", "body": "As a frequent user and a manager of a snapshot space from a small community, I’m very pleased to see my previous suggestions are being realized gradually by the amazing team and how snapshot keeps contributing to the success of DAO governance.\n\nFrom the times I can tell, it’s getting better and better in its **optimized creation flow**, **new** **quick access sidebars**, **notification dropdown**, **enhanced hovertips** and my favorite **personal profile** feature showing one’s voting history that I’ve never expected to launch this soon!\n\nI want to write this feedback as a follow-up of what I’ve submitted earlier this year before, from the voice of a long-term user, and also from my community members, sincerely wish these ideas will help snapshot go better in the coming future.🌟\n\n\n---\n\n### 1. Add a voting status in the proposals page\n\nThe counter in the right corner of a space shows the number of proposals that have recently entered into the active state, so I guess it’s not possible to make them disappear once a voter casts all the existing votes.\n\nHowever, is it possible to doing a workaround by adding a voter’s voting record at the bottom of **an active proposal item**, just like the “majority choice“ of a closed proposal, indicating that the user has voted this proposal. It can simply be a similar version of what’s inside the proposals votes list.\n\nIt will be of a great help since we often encounter situations where we have to load a series of proposals at consecutive intervals, and members may forget to pick each one of them or double vote on the same proposal since they can’t just remember each of their voting behavior in such situations. By enabling this improvents, people won’t need to click in to check their status, this helps much in governance efficiency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DC62Iu5BytfCmRcjGa5P0.png?height=369&width=835)\n\n### 2. Default starting time to “Now” when duplicating a proposal\n\nIn most cases, we don’t duplicate a proposal simply because of a typo or something like that. Rather, it’s when we find a mistake in our strategy or the proposal doesn’t meet our quorum due to special reasons, we have to do so since once the proposal is posted, it becomes immutable and we can’t revoke it.\n\nMost importantly, the snapshot of the proposal is based on the creation time of itself, not the starting time we set. It doesn’t make a lot of sense that the duplicated proposal still inherits the previous one, especially a very old one with which date we will just **post a closed state** **of proposal** at the current time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6u5JQMRNfqZutZ_lc2Uc.png?height=173&width=758)\n\n### 3. Unify the interaction dynamics on the creation process\n\nIt’s a typical thing mentioned by our authors, that sometimes they just cannot find the “Back“ button to navigate to the last page.\n\nWe found out that most likely it’s because of **the inconsistency** of the backward logic.\n\nThe current creation process is split into 2 pages: the main body of proposal, and the Choice form. While the interface has a different logic in these 2 consecutive pages, it can create kind of loss in user’s consciousness.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we should **add the “←Back“ button** to each of the creation page to bridge that inconsistency.\n\n![Inconsistency: Proposal Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0DX2Kw1zvXa3zZIu9cvTa.png?height=180&width=1253)\n\n![Inconsistency: Choice Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyODQDIYrVLQE9ycTV0Xm.png?height=203&width=1228)\n\n### 4. Integrate notification bells into one within the app\n\nI noticed that Snapshot now has a full list of notification methods we can choose from: HAL, discord bot, epns, webhooks… The notification bell within the space page seems a little outdated, and our members are often confused at what these two bells represent for respectively.\n\nIt spent me a while to get to understand that they actually control different ways of notification, but this also creates a sort of fragmentation within UI. Imagining one wants to turn off notification messages from a specific space he joins in the upper right dropdown list, there’s no way to do so, and the bell below the space name won’t work either, but to switch to another notifiation type.\n\nIMHO, we can make this page much neater by **integrating** the left notication bell with the newer one, and after that it will only point to one type of notification where user can actually control to accept a specific range of space messages.\n\n![two similar bells](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ujtOy7j3fj90TsTHabvT.png?height=426&width=1355)\n\n### 5. Highlight voting types\n\nPastachiodao is a very good example that I use it every time when I try to teach new members who are going to cast their fist votes.\n\nBut sometimes when new members flood in, it’s inevitable someone doesn’t fully comprehend the meaning of the voting system or just neglect the voting type the proposal is using since it’s just placed in the upper right corner of the page.\n\nI’m thinking of a way just like what Pastachiodao did. But differently I want the ‘‘demo’’ directly embedded within a proposal in the simple form like **a short explained hint**, to remind the users which voting type they are acting on, to let them know they can actually choose one more options in an “approval voting” type. I can’t help thinking it because it would be a great attempt to further ‘‘educate’’ our users the knowledge of snapshot in a very practical way.\n\nIt can be in the choice form section **beside ‘“cast your vote“**, indicating a voting type.\n\n![a hint beside \"Cast your vote\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6N3uMa5G1q-rVr39Sqzt.png?height=421&width=790)\n\n### 6. Make visible the bottom bar in the homepage\n\nThe bottom bar provides essential information like official contact, display mode, language setting and official tutorials.\n\nThese elements are highly useful and should be **available at anytime** at least in the homepage. (experience from other well-known projects)\n\nHowever, if one hits the “load more” button, it just keeps loading down forever until all spaces will show up, and the bottom bar containing these information just keep **“blipping“** on each loading. One has to refresh the page to get it back to the original state.\n\nTo keep the bottom bar at a certain visibility level, I can think of 3 options:\n\n1. Pin the bottom bar like “freeze panes” in an excel, so loading will not break its existence.\n2. Add a load limit, like 50 spaces/load, after that, one has to retrigger the load manually.\n3. Keep it as it was. But after one hits the “load more” button and the load starts looping, one will be able to return back the state by hitting “snapshot“ in the top bar or “⚡“ in the sidebar.\n\n![Blip on each \"load more\"...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fTeNuFG5QZzzfxItSeGXw.png?height=219&width=1273)\n\n### 7.  Optimize the experience of edit box\n\nWe usually tweak our strategies in the UI, its original edit box. But the experience is not good, especially for a long code, every time an input will **bring the whole page to the top**, again and again, it brings us headache since we just **lost** where we were in the middle of job. I believe the issue also happens in any edit box like a plugin modal, or the playground…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DokWdmd9oj0EsZkKiZ7k.png?height=680&width=562)\n\n### 8. Strategy reuse\n\nFor different proposal types, we have different strategies to apply.\n\nWe know snapshot doesn’t allow the author to choose arbitrary strategies at his will. We successfully manage it at the admin level, to centralize the use of strategies.\n\nBut as such, we’re also considering for a DAO which has a pool of 10 strategies (and we use it on rotation like 3-4 strategies a time), if we can make things more efficient by keeping those **strategies temporarily not in use** in an “**inactive state”** rather than just deleting them and re-adding them back when it comes to use again?\n\nTherefore we don’t bother to write them again and can bring them back with just a click, which provides much more flexibility.\n\n![Adding a disable button besides delete?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0E6joStNfYGl_uYNbV-Zp.png?height=402&width=771)\n\n### 9. Preserve the input state of the keywords on strategies section\n\nThe number of snapshot’s strategies is exploding, which is good! However sometimes we can hardly tell the exact function of a strategy by its name and have to click in and run a test one by one.\n\nIt’s somewhat inconvenient when we click the return button, and it brings us to the whole list of strategy after we find out it’s not our strategy, we have to **input the keywords  again** to filter to the target lists.\n\nI wish the app can remember the state of our input keywords when we return to the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LWmGGniXeLhjlpBO-Pid6.png?height=290&width=1306)\n\nThanks for reading all the way through, hereby I give my best wishes to snapshot’s future as well as my community！❤", "timestamp": 1653372043, "digest": "XUFYktLBZvMnbNVihV84Iq0xq0hafZ_Rl8FbbO8uIKc", "contributor": "0x4F777E46C37fc4a2f70FdFB3a0A7C56C93EE82F0"}

天取回来，完成交互，它上面还有两个产品可以交互，杠杆种植农业但是损失可能比较大，会随着币价波动带来不确定性，谨慎参与，另一个封装期权产品可以参与，损失相对较少，根据自己的情况接下来可以选择性交互[friktion](https://app.friktion.fi/income%EF%BC%89)，需要兑换成SOL（大的风险来自于SOL价格下跌）和7天的锁仓期，很早之前写过这个项目的详细解读教程，如果想参与可以在mirror上找来看看，完成这些项目交互，为了减少损失，我们选择把USDC转移回币安交易所，再次进行其他项目交互，**一定要选择币安交易所的SOL链钱包地址转回**\n\n再次以同样的方式从交易所转账USDC到BSC链（为了多交互跨链桥，当然也可以直接转账到Polygon链），通过上面的跨链桥（如果这两个跨链桥交互资金和次数满意了可以选择其他未发币跨链桥转移）转移到Polygon链，准备把代币转移进ZKsync.\n\n通过[slingshot](https://app.slingshot.finance/%EF%BC%89)或者[clipper](https://clipper.exchange/app/swap%EF%BC%89)交易平台把USDC兑换成WETH，交易损失也比较小\n\n转移代币WETH到ZKsync通过跨链桥[orbiter.finance](https://www.orbiter.finance/%EF%BC%89)（由Polygon链转到zksync）整个花费4，5刀左右\n\n转移完成后通过zksync平台可以看到转移过来的代币，这里需要强调一下，我们最好能够在GAS费低的时候，通过zksync自己的跨链桥从ETH主网转移代币到平台上，花费大概15-20刀左右，跨链完成。这是官方指定的几种跨链方式都可以做一做，zksync大概两个月前就在推特发过这个项目要发币的一些蛛丝马迹，跟着过来大概知道，所以早期埋伏很重要。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Et-sAecYc_poVPM0A4VMT.png?height=553&width=1136)\n\n然后通过[zigzag](https://trade.zigzag.exchange/?market=ETH-USDC&network=zksync%EF%BC%89)交易平台把WETH兑换成USDC，需要留存一点WETH作为汽油费，交互完成（凑够足量的资金多次交互）\n\n在这个新项目[tevaera.com](https://tevaera.com)完成mint早期NFT，花费基本忽略。\n这是这个项目的mint教程，比较简单\n\n[https://tevaera.medium.com/minting-tevaera-citizen-id-nft-e8fe88f11484](https://tevaera.medium.com/minting-tevaera-citizen-id-nft-e8fe88f11484)\n\n13，Argent钱包交互操作教程找了一个已经制作的好的作参考\n\n[https://medium.com/@jianshubiji/%E7%A9%BA%E6%8A%95%E5%9F%8B%E4%BC%8F-argent%E9%92%B1%E5%8C%85%E4%BA%A4%E4%BA%92%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B-6017e3806f5e](https://medium.com/@jianshubiji/%E7%A9%BA%E6%8A%95%E5%9F%8B%E4%BC%8F-argent%E9%92%B1%E5%8C%85%E4%BA%A4%E4%BA%92%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B-6017e3806f5e)\n\n还是要在此声明一下：这绝对不是任何投资建议，能不能做请根据自己的能力酌情考虑，花费资金就会涉及到风险，注意分寸为好\n\n**如果你喜欢我制作的内容，请关注推特[（twitter.com/maik2hello](https://twitter.com/maik2hello%EF%BC%89)）了解掌握更多币圈值得关注的项目和信息。**\n\n币圈超实用工具包合集共18个部分置顶推特，有需要可收藏\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MKYZ7oHTmP9CVbeGoIjDZ.png?height=609&width=908)\n\n",

如果你一直关注我: [twitter.com/zlexdl](http://twitter.com/zlexdl) ,一直学习的话, 我觉得你很轻松就能找到答案.\n\n在我发的 <<使用RSS筛选币圈有用的信息>>文章中, 教会你了如何掌握币圈的大量信息.\n\n只要简单的搜索一下关键词就能轻松找到答案, 可惜没几个人这么做吧.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/zlexdl.eth/CZR_mSfTNm0vfPdx1YDTi0zaM-X1vxeURz_f8078RrM](https://mirror.xyz/zlexdl.eth/CZR_mSfTNm0vfPdx1YDTi0zaM-X1vxeURz_f8078RrM)\n\n\n---\n\n**言归正传, 说一下如何mint, mint 有三种途径.**\n\n### 第一种: 使用官方直接mint\n\n这一种,我想大家都会吧, 如果不会的话, 那就退圈吧.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HQdjDvA1Du1dtMThePZwt.png?height=1524&width=1126)\n\n链接Metamask小狐狸, 直接点击mint按钮,如果没有售空, 并且没有限制的话,就可以mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E3qFRSXE8Ap9fkFgqbOAg.png?height=1030&width=1422)\n\n**注意:很多合约是前多少名额是免费Mint的, 这样的我的机器人也会检测出来, 不要到时候来问我为什么不是免费的你还要发呢.**\n\n\n---\n\n### 第二种: 利用合约Mint\n\n有一些人就问我, 为啥机器人发的一些mint信息没有Website啊?\n\n因为这些图狗根本就没准备Website, 都是为了捞一波就跑的.\n\n这种情况就需要我们进行合约Mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zE-C75sLppsbc1UszgHWX.png?height=1734&width=1127)\n\n点击Etherscan后的链接之后就会看到以下画面.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lw9EXCrebONr8jduejln5.png?height=1632&width=2066)\n\n每个合约都不太一样, 如果你懂开发的话, 可以去 点击Code 按钮去看看代码,\n\n当然如果你开发的话, 你就不用看这篇文章了.\n\n具体Mint 步骤\n\n**1. 点击Connect to Web3 按钮去连接Metamask小狐狸钱包.**\n\n成功之后是这样的:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oQejgwHZdYiTedqC8psX.png?height=405&width=783)\n\n**2.一般方法区都会有Mint ,FreeMint, MintTo, publicMint或是其他带有mint的方法.**\n\n点击 1.FreeMint之后, 可以看到以下画面.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TpoC9xQupn5nNSKxCWctV.png?height=499&width=504)\n\n因为是免费Mint ,所以单价输入框要输入0, 数量输入你喜欢的, 但是这个经常会有限制, 有的是每个地址只能mint一个, 有的是每个地址只能mint10个, 每个合约都不太一样.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qaGBxKfjvAMsOV-orEUQ1.png?height=581&width=676)\n\n**3. 输入好之后点击Write按钮就可以mint了, 如果符合各种条件就会成功的.**\n\n但是当出现以下画面时就放弃吧, 如果你钱多可以给直接发给我.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PHnHgNn18ej8y-fasJ2pP.png?height=382&width=500)\n\n另外: 当你不知道哪个方法是可以mint的呢, 例如以下这个合约的方法, 找不出合适的mint方法\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rApKQ1jIsYFX6eUQAxB4R.png?height=1136&width=515)\n\n你就可以Transactions页面看看其他人都用什么方法.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NwaW7wyn2S7EDhhQd96LR.png?height=905&width=976)\n\n然后会再回到刚才的方法页面去试试, 就可以了.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/W0E0AJLSe_b2uyFnlJ3Wq.png?height=1038&width=1068)\n\n\n---\n\n### 第三种: 跟单Mint\n\n跟单Mint也叫十六进位数据Mint.\n\n就是使用其他人已经Mint的Input Data(十六进位数据)去mint.\n\n**准备工作:**\n\nMetamask小狐狸的【设置】-【高级】-【显示十六进制数据】点击成**启用**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wlvdOsj43Wwli2VQiUVcj.png?height=909&width=551)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gUbOTu_AQy_yFWtZwnBUz.png?height=903&width=553)\n\n在第二种方法已经说了, 先去Transactions页面去看其他人的传输记录.\n\n**去Transactions页面找到近期已经成功Mint并且Value为0的传输, 点击进去**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gywPQUMMi9tLclSPx62_c.png?height=960&width=2068)\n\n可以看出这个记录mint了4个, 那么你如果使用他Input data也会mint4个的, 这点需要注意.\n\n当然也不是没有办法修改的, 但是需要时间, 等你改完了就来不及了, 反正都是免费的.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BXLchbA72CX-RPHJCGja3.png?height=1682&width=1606)\n\n点击上图中左下角的 **Click to see More** 按钮后, 点击**View Input AS**后选择**Original**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/siHeRkhE72bAxmK2KvMHj.png?height=1047&width=1466)\n\n复制红框中的字符串\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3YG3HbQhlReGP53Thr1eB.png?height=396&width=1571)\n\n一定是项目合约地址，不是项目方地址, 千万别选错了,要不然就浪费gas了.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pKWxTzKQP1E-r-OmGj317.png?height=858&width=1357)\n\n这个也是合约地址.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y6gl5P0YYuqc4K5LuKwNx.png?height=154&width=959)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6dhWEFPFh8Bq6v-tWFHnC.png?height=1608&width=636)\n\nMatamask小狐狸钱包的主界面点击 发送 按钮就会出现以上画面\n\n分别输入合约地址, 0数额, 刚才取得的十六进制数据, 然后点击下一步就可以Mint了.\n\n**补充: 十六进位数据Mint有三种, 上面的是第一种, 直接拿到Input Data去mint**\n\n**第二种是需要把Input data中一部分字符串修改成自己的地址(不代0x).**\n\n感谢 [twitter.com/yuzijun0902](http://twitter.com/yuzijun0902) 和图狗群的 **猫** 提供的信息\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BZR2B3m5bDE6YaE_eltyS.png?height=1724&width=1883)\n\n**第三种Input data是一堆乱码, 无法mint**\n\n\n---\n\n## 关于如何找到金狗\n\n说实话这个是很难的, 如果大家都能确定是金狗, 就都发财了.\n\n但是金狗还是有一定特征的,\n\n**一般可以看看总供应量, 供应量少的概率大一些.**\n\n**可以看看社区, 推特的关注量, Discord的公告, 很多项目因为进入了熊市就把原定付费Mint的改成了免费Mint, 例如凯撒猿,

　　宁崎拖着旅行箱走到出站口，便看到人群中陶东来正一脸兴奋地高高举着双手朝自己挥舞着。宁崎嘴角浮出一丝微笑，也举起手朝对方示意了一下。 \n  \n 　　“老同学，可把你等来了！”陶东来一把握住了宁崎的手，那热情的劲头让宁崎感觉似乎又回到了十年前的大学时光。 \n  \n 　　宁崎和陶东来是大学同班同学，又是一个寝室的室友，大学四年里关系铁得可以穿一条裤子。但大学毕业之后陶东来居然去参军当了三年兵，然后南下创业搞房地产，自己当起了老板，宁崎则选择了留校一边当老师一边考研读博的高级知识分子修炼之路，两人碰面的机会就少了许多。不过最近这几年陶东来生意越做越大，腰包也鼓起来了，于是主动做东每两年一次在广州举办一次同学会，吃喝玩乐全包，作为好朋友的宁崎自然当仁不让每次都要从武汉飞过来捧场。 \n  \n 　　两人关系好归好，但陶东来这个大忙人今天会亲自跑到机场来接自己，这是宁崎没有料想到的，记得前几次来广州的时候，陶东来都因为工作原因无法脱身，只安排了秘书之类的办事人员到机场接机。这个小细节起先并没有引起宁崎的注意，等到出了机场上车，陶东来并没有像以往那样带着专职司机，而是自己坐到了驾驶座，宁崎才发现今天似乎真的有些不寻常。 \n  \n 　　“今天你的司机和秘书是商量好一起罢工了？”宁崎一边系上安全带一边开玩笑问道。 \n  \n 　　“那倒不是，是因为有些事我想和你单独谈谈，不希望有外人在场。”陶东来脸上的神情却是没有半点开玩笑的样子。 \n  \n 　　宁崎点了点头，并没有再追问下去。作为多年的朋友他很了解陶东来的性格，如果陶东来说某件事“需要谈谈”，那么就说明这件事情绝不是可有可无的小事。 \n  \n 　　沉默了良久，宁崎才开口道：“所以这次你把我叫过来的原因应该也不是你在电话里说的那样，为了筹备今年的同学会吧？” \n  \n 　　“今年没有时间开同学会了，下半年我要做的事情太多。”陶东来并没有否认自己玩的小花样，侧头看了看宁崎的脸色并无不快，又接了一句：“或许你下半年也会跟我一起忙。” \n  \n 　　“你这是打算要挖我到你公司做事？”宁崎哑然失笑道：“虽然我们在大学是学的工商管理专业，但你应该知道我的兴趣和你不一样，我对做生意真是一窍不通。” \n  \n 　　“我当然知道你对做生意没兴趣，你这个伪明粉，兴趣都在研究历史嘛！放心吧，我让你千里迢迢的飞到广州来，不会勉强你去做你没兴趣的事情。” \n  \n 　　宁崎眼神一亮：“你是在拍卖会买到什么好东西了？还是你那房地产公司修房子挖到古墓了？” \n  \n 　　这下陶东来却是卖起了关子，对此避而不答，转而询问起了宁崎的近况。宁崎虽然有些无奈，但转念一想反正陶东来应该有求于自己，也不可能一直隐瞒下去。 \n  \n 　　陶东来在广州四季酒店已经帮宁崎定好了房间，两人到了之后办完手续进到房间，宁崎一屁股坐到沙发上，急不可待地说道：“好了，到底什么事，你就赶快从实招来吧！” \n  \n 　　陶东来却并没有急着开口，从手包里掏出烟盒，抽了一支递给宁崎，宁崎摇摇手道：“戒了。” \n  \n 　　“又没成家，好端端的戒烟干嘛……”陶东来嘀咕了一句，收回来自己点上了，吸了两口之后才继续说道：“宁崎，我叫你到广州来，是有些东西想让你亲眼看看。但我希望你能给我一个承诺，就是不管你看到之后有什么样的想法，都绝对不要把你的所见所闻说出去，任何人都不行！” \n  \n 　　“说得这么严重，你不会是做了什么犯法的事情吧？”宁崎一脸狐疑地问道。 \n  \n 　　“瞧你这点胆子，还跟以前读书的时候一样，这么多年一点长进都没有！”陶东来见宁崎不搭话，只好应道：“放心吧，不是犯法的事情。但这事真的不宜公开，等你看了之后自然就明白了。” \n  \n 　　“那什么时候看？”宁崎见陶东来这么遮遮掩掩的，反而更是激起了好奇心。 \n  \n 　　“不用急，今晚就带你去。”陶东来站起身道：“行了，你先休息一会儿，晚一点我来接你吃晚饭，顺便介绍几位朋友给你认识。” \n  \n 　　“你这是要组队下副本的节奏啊！”宁崎忍不住开了句玩笑。 \n  \n 　　已经走到门口的陶东来回过头来笑了笑：“你说的没错，就是去下副本。” \n  \n 　　晚饭时分陶东来到房间接了宁崎，直接坐电梯到了酒店71层的愉粤轩，进到包房之后，宁崎发现已经有三名男子入座了。陶东来一边招呼宁崎挨着自己坐下，一边给几人互相介绍了身份。 \n  \n 　　坐在陶东来右边平头黑肤的壮男叫颜楚杰，内蒙人，陶东来当兵的时候是一个班的战友，前年才转业回到地方上，现在是某个国营大厂的保卫处处长，话不多看起来很稳重的样子。 \n  \n 　　颜楚杰旁边带着黑框眼镜，白白净净一副文艺青年形象的男子叫白克思，乍一听有点像老外。白克思和陶东来据说有多年的生意合作，自己经营着一间小型金属加工厂和一间家具厂，另外还在做外贸进出口代理业务。这家伙另外还有一个网络写手的身份倒是让宁崎微微吃了一惊，实在不明白他打理生意之余还哪来的精力写小说娱乐大众。 \n  \n 　　最后一个坐在白克思和宁崎中间的男子看外表要年轻一些，这人宁崎倒是见过，是陶东来的表弟顾凯。大学时宁崎到陶东来老家去玩过，当时这个顾凯还在读初中，一转眼也已经是三十来岁的人了。陶东来介绍说顾凯去了美国读大学，毕业之后就留在那边发展了，目前在旧金山当律师。 \n  \n 　　“人到齐了，上菜吧！”陶东来一挥手，示意服务员开席。 \n  \n 　　几个人一边吃一边闲聊着，宁崎注意到陶东来并没有点酒，其他几人似乎对此也没有任何异议。从交谈之中看得出这几人之前已经见过不止一次了，但他们所谈的话题却并没提及陶东来下午所说的事情。 \n  \n 　　菜过五味之后，白克思对宁崎问道：“宁先生，我听陶老板说你业余时间很喜欢研究历史，依你之见，如果一个人穿越去了几百年前的古时候，最需要什么样的技能才能出人头地？” \n  \n 　　宁崎先是觉得有些奇怪，然后想到对方的网络写手身份就释然了，想必这家伙在网上写穿越小说才会琢磨这种匪夷所思的事情吧。出于礼貌，宁崎还是认真地作了回答：“恕我直言，如果一个现代人穿越到几百年前，能出人头地的几率是很小的。现代人所掌握的专业技能和知识，其实在古时候能用得上的并不多，更大的可能会因为奇思怪谈被人当作神经病，或者是慢慢被当时的社会所同化掉。我认为如果没有比较实用的求生技能，去到那个时代很可能连一个月都熬不过去。” \n  \n 　　“那也未必吧！”提出反对意见的不是白克思，而是那个一直没怎么开口的颜楚杰：“我在部队里干了十多年，亲手带过的兵少说也有好几千了，每天除了吃饭睡觉就是研究军事，要论带兵打仗的本事，怎么也比几百年前见识有限的古人强吧？我要是去了几百年前，当个参将甚至总兵肯定是没问题的。到时候我练一支强军出来，只靠排队枪毙战术就能打遍天下。” \n  \n 　　“颜先生，我很相信你的军事素质，但如果把你放在几百年前，想练出一支强军可不是那么容易的事情。别的先不说，就说当时的人一天只能吃两顿饭，这身体的素质就没办法适应大运动量的操练，要解决吃饭问题你就得先解决后勤供应，吃不饱饭还强行练兵的后果很可能就是哗变。另外军械的提供也是一大难题，要对使用冷兵器的军队取得压倒性优势，我们都知道必须使用火器，我相信你对枪械很熟悉，但你自己会制造火器吗？就算你懂得枪械制造原理，那也需要冶金、金属加工和化工技术的配套行业非常完善才行。军队的实力是国力的体现，以几百年前的生产力水平而言，不太可能支撑起一支现代化的军队。”宁崎谈得兴起，忍不住噼里啪啦对颜楚杰展开了一番反驳。 \n  \n 　　颜楚杰闻言还想分辩几句，白克思却是抢在了前面：“那宁先生觉得要怎样做才能保证现代人回到古时候能有一个相对比较安全的发展基础，然后运用自己的知识去改变当时的社会？” \n  \n 　　“至少……要在尽可能短的时间内建立起近代的工业体系才行，只有生产力的\\*\\*\\*才能改变社会。”这次宁崎沉吟了一阵才答了出来，但旋即又摇头否定了自己的说法：“这个假设不太可能办到，一个人的学识是有限的，单枪匹马根本无法建设一个工业体系，何况近代工业还得要有电力的保障，穿越者有可能凭借自己掌握超越时代的知识成为那个时空的法拉第，但即便伟大如法拉第，从发现电磁感应到世界上建成第一家发电厂，这中间也用了足足四十四年时间，我们哪怕能把这个时间缩短到一半，那也同样难以接受。当然你如果真的相信小说里那样依靠简陋的水力机械就可以钻枪膛炮膛甚至大规模生产军火，那我也无话可说。” \n  \n 　　陶东来很适时地替宁崎的发言作了总结：“也就是说，单枪匹马的穿越到古时候基本没可能拥有改变社会的力量，我这样理解对吧？” \n  \n 　　宁崎点了点头道：“除非是直接穿成了皇帝，全天下都得围着自己屁股转。要不就得带上一支规模庞大的技术支持团队，还有足以保障起步阶段能够顺利运转的物资。” \n  \n 　　宁崎说完之后注意到其他四人默默地交换了一下眼色，似乎在无声之间达成了某种默契。随后话题便转到了各自的私生活上，宁崎很惊讶地发现在座的五人居然全是单身汉，颜楚杰和宁崎自己是还没有结婚的中年男，而陶东来跟白克思则是各自已经离过一次婚，顾凯倒是有个感情稳定的美国女友，但家里长辈似乎对于他打算找个大洋马当老婆的做法颇有些不认同。但陶东来为什么要将这样几个人从五湖四海召集到一起在这里碰面，到目前为止宁崎依然是毫无头绪。 \n  \n 　　饭后其他三人便告辞离去，而陶东来则是陪同宁崎回到房间，宁崎发现床上多了一个旅行包出来。 \n  \n 　　“是我让人送来的，等下我们要去的地方环境不是太方便，包里是鞋和衣服，你先换好。我还有点事情要处理，十二点我来接你出发。”陶东来说完也不等宁崎多问便离开了。 \n  \n 　　宁崎打开旅行包，见是一套columbia的冲锋服和登山鞋，不禁有些疑惑：“难道等下大半夜的还要去爬山？” \n  \n 　　宁崎揣着一脑门子问题等到了十二点，陶东来果然按时来了，而且也换上了全套的户外行头，宁崎只带了手机和房门卡便跟着陶东来出发了。到了停车场宁崎发现今天一起吃晚饭的三个家伙已经在一辆大切诺基上等着了，同样也是换了行头，看样子一切都是早有安排。虽然心中有些疑惑，但既来之则安之，宁崎这时候肯定不可能再打退堂鼓说不去，便爽快地上车没有再多问什么。 \n  \n 　　宁崎来过广州很多次了，所以黑夜之中仍是能够分辨方向，见车居然一路开到了越秀山，果然应了自己先前的猜测。但这越秀山只有一些人文景观，这大半夜上山有什么可看的？ \n  \n 　　车停在了越秀山体育场外面，下车之后，人高马大的颜楚杰从后备箱取出一个鼓鼓囊囊的大登山包背在背上，然后几人鱼贯向山上行去。 \n  \n 　　在经过镇海楼的时候陶东来出声问道：“宁崎，你记得这里吧？” \n  \n 　　宁崎应道：“当然记得，我第一次来广州玩的时候，你知道我喜欢明史，特地带我来这里看过。” \n  \n 　　镇海楼是广州的标志建筑之一，始建于明代洪武年间，历史上经历过多次损毁和重建，现在的镇海楼是1929年改建的，这栋五层古楼除了是著名的人文景观之外，同时也是广州博物馆的所在。 \n  \n 　　绕过镇海楼之后前行了几百米，队伍在陶东来的带领下居然步入了一处没有道路的密林之中。陶东来倒是早有准备，强光手电照射在地上，几人在树丛中又走了两分钟，已经远离了山间步道，陶东来才示意队伍停下。颜楚杰打开登山包取出里面的东西开始在地上铺开，陶东来把手电往宁崎手里一塞，与白克思和顾凯都蹲下身去帮忙，宁崎借着手电的光线一看，发现居然是一顶不小的帐篷，难道这几人还打算在越秀山上露营不成？ \n  \n 　　帐篷很快搭好，在陶东来的带头之下，五个人都进到了帐篷里，颜楚杰又从包里摸出一个led帐篷灯挂上接通电源。宁崎发现其他几人的脸色都很严肃，一点没有野外露营的轻松气氛。 \n  \n 　　陶东来压低了声音对宁崎道：“现在开始，无论你看到了什么，请一定保持冷静，不要大声说话，不要用手电到处乱照，一切行动听我指挥，有问题吗？” \n  \n 　　宁崎已经不知道自己该说什么了，只是呆呆地点了点头。 \n

Additionally, how do you think feminine aesthetics are interpreted in crypto?\n\n问：\n\n在一个男性主导的市场和行业中，你的大部分艺术作品都是超女性化的。除了激励更多有抱负的女性参与创作，拓宽大众对聚焦女性的艺术接受度， BitchCoin 是如何作为先驱，让下一代可以去跟随、学习，改变大范围的目光聚焦？艺术家在这里的作用是什么？此外，你认为女性美学在加密货币中是如何被诠释的？\n\n答：\n\n我认为艺术家的角色不一定要有某种目的性，不一定要成为一个活动家。我想要创造一些作品，能够在理性、情感、视觉上触动你。说来简单，但现实困难重重。我不想只传递一种信息，告诉大家“ BitchCoin 是给女性赋能的，这是我们的信条”。那样大家就都是只把视觉添加到艺术上的活动家而已。但艺术远不止这些。艺术可以更复杂，更黑暗，更混乱，甚至它可以是错的。所以，你不需要无时无刻高举社会事业的大旗，你可以行动起来去解决一些问题。这就是艺术的作用。女性美学，在当下的加密货币世界中并不“流行”。现在更多的是“游戏”美学，这显然很不女性化。我不觉得这是一种歧视，我觉得这是进化过程中很自然的一部分。 NFT 源自于加密货币和游戏，而加密货币和游戏是非常男性化的。\n\n作为女性，我不是在游戏中长大的。但我懂点技术，与此同时，我还是一个投资人，所以自然而然被加密货币所吸引。但这当中肯定有超越性别偏见的东西，因为它已经被极度扭曲到一个失去理性的极致。我们必须找到一种新的方式而不只是单纯的投机，才能让女性更多地参与进来。\n\n\n---\n\n问：\n\n你谈到并写到了艺术和价值概念之间的相互作用。在这种评估下，你提到了黄金和艺术品的估值过程之间的共同点—这两种珍贵（但不是无价）的商品是演进的、独特和稀有的，它们的价值是根据历史重要性和需求来判断的。 NFT 是风险资产，由加密货币社区驱动。作为一种资产， NFT 与加密货币有什么可比性？在加密货币世界，艺术家是如何围绕他们的名字、作品和品牌建立价值的？\n\n答：\n\n艺术和黄金有一个共同点，它们都是文化资产。从根本上说，都是一个锻造的过程，把基础材料转化为更高阶的东西。黄金和艺术家，他们都是没有股利的资产，他们都是纯粹的投机资产，文化上的投机，黄金相对来说还好点。就这一点来说，黄金和加密货币显然是有联系的。 BitchCoin 就是某种数字黄金。所以，对我来说，它们都在同一个泡沫里。NFT很有趣，因为它们与加密货币捆绑在一起，某种程度上来说，其实是和某条链捆绑。现在 BitchCoin 让我和以太坊建立起联系。很有意思，从某种意义上说，它们也是艺术家的 “工作证明”。这就像一个以太坊商店，很有意思。\n\n艺术一直都是一种资产。现在， NFT 让艺术可以即时交易，艺术从未获得过这样的流动性。你甚至不需要考虑存储问题，存储已经如同空气般轻便。而且，这个市场不像（传统）拍卖行，每年只有几次拍卖。任何时候，你只要轻轻点击按钮就可以进行买卖。交易如此的顺滑，似乎我们已经打造出一个图像股票市场。有人在下跌时买入，有人得到小道消息提前买入，也有人洗盘交易。人们早已把某些事情比作是内幕交易。种种迹象表明我们已经把这个实际上还只是艺术市场的地方当做股票市场了。\n\n以前，收藏品基本上是爱马仕包，和棒球卡等。这些东西通常都被大型跨国公司严格操控。但现在，任何人都可以拥有藏品。你正常购买的任何商品，不管是一辆车或一件衬衫，当你把它带出商店的那一秒，它的价值已经发生变化了，它贬值了，大多数东西都是如此。\n\n然而， NFT 市场不同，我们必须向人们出售不会立即贬值的东西。这是一个非常有趣的问题。品牌必须处理好这个问题，因为大公司有责任，不能欺骗他们的消费者。如果小孩在制作图片和 NFT ，每个人都觉得有风险。但是，如果品牌商这样做，并且还有一个二级市场供他们发布 NFT ，情况就变了。现在的问题是，如果你开始向你的 NFT 持有者做出一些承诺，让他们觉得你在为他们工作，这就是一种担保。如果我说，我将卖出一些其他的 NFT ，然后用得到的利润回购 BitchCoin ，即使这是我通过努力增加 BitchCoin 的价值。或者我直接把钱空投给我的 NFT 持有人，那也会成为一种担保，因为人们觉得 BitchCoin “在做事”。创造一种需要市场、需要维持价值的资产，同时还不需要担保，这之间的界限非常微妙。\n\n\n---\n\n问：\n\n最后，在这种情况下，一个毫无名气的创作者，创作了一个新的 NFT ，在没有背景和需求的情况下，如何赢得认可并提升作品的价值？\n\n答：\n\n现在， NFT 市场有着和实体艺术世界截然不同的生态系统。他们凝视着对方，试图与对方交谈。但目前为止，我还没有发现他们之间有太多重叠之处。\n\nNFT 的评判标准非常不同。我现在在伦敦有一个展览，展出全息图，它们没办法被电子化记录。它们完全是模拟出来的。除了版本大小之外，没有任何稀有特征。可能你会喜欢它的内容、它的美学，也可能完全不喜欢。如果你是一个不知名的创作者，除了创造和分享作品之外，没有任何捷径。现在还没有作品把关人，但有很多充满好奇心的人（在这个市场），你可以随时随地开始这场探索。\n\n2015 年，那时鲜有人涉足这个市场，某种程度上，基础建设上确实困难重重，但知名度相对容易获得。在首次发行的时候，我们以 100 美元的单价卖出了 200 个 BitchCoin 。今天，各种各样的平台、小组、对谈、会议，你只要参与进来，开始分享就行了。加密货币社区才成立没多久，大家都希望它能成功，所以每个人都非常友好。这是我到目前为止的亲身体验。\n\n\n---\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5yOovR5b5zBeWYimUBLo1.jpeg?height=1320&width=1080)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9eVegV8N928vkPJd6Pj4G.jpeg?height=266&width=716)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653372634, "digest": "2TD_FPlyfnSk0QX2XRsqV8RD_KeVdS3Pta5AlVj2i9o", "contributor": "0x3381BB3B23F14eDcE0F8C22aF12194575392375A"}

{"id": "tzA7HrW46ciOa5k2M_llzmKWhrhwHVXJTYs1_fKCXpc", "title": "UI Feedback", "body": "As a frequent user and a manager of a snapshot space from a small community, I’m very pleased to see my previous suggestions are being realized gradually by the amazing team and how snapshot keeps contributing to the success of DAO governance.\n\nFrom the times I can tell, it’s getting better and better in its **optimized creation flow**, **new** **quick access sidebars**, **notification dropdown**, **enhanced hovertips** and my favorite **personal profile** feature showing one’s voting history that I’ve never expected to launch this soon!\n\nI want to write this feedback as a follow-up of what I’ve submitted earlier this year before, from the voice of a long-term user, and also from my community members, sincerely wish these ideas will help snapshot go better in the coming future.🌟\n\n\n---\n\n### 1. Add a voting status in the proposals page\n\nThe counter in the right corner of a space shows the number of proposals that have recently entered into the active state, so I guess it’s not possible to make them disappear once a voter casts all the existing votes.\n\nHowever, is it possible to doing a workaround by adding a voter’s voting record at the bottom of **an active proposal item**, just like the “majority choice“ of a closed proposal, indicating that the user has voted this proposal. It can simply be a similar version of what’s inside the proposals votes list.\n\nIt will be of a great help since we often encounter situations where we have to load a series of proposals at consecutive intervals, and members may forget to pick each one of them or double vote on the same proposal since they can’t just remember each of their voting behavior in such situations. By enabling this improvents, people won’t need to click in to check their status, this helps much in governance efficiency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DC62Iu5BytfCmRcjGa5P0.png?height=369&width=835)\n\n### 2. Default starting time to “Now” when duplicating a proposal\n\nIn most cases, we don’t duplicate a proposal simply because of a typo or something like that. Rather, it’s when we find a mistake in our strategy or the proposal doesn’t meet our quorum due to special reasons, we have to do so since once the proposal is posted, it becomes immutable and we can’t revoke it.\n\nMost importantly, the snapshot of the proposal is based on the creation time of itself, not the starting time we set. It doesn’t make a lot of sense that the duplicated proposal still inherits the previous one, especially a very old one with which date we will just **post a closed state** **of proposal** at the current time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6u5JQMRNfqZutZ_lc2Uc.png?height=173&width=758)\n\n### 3. Unify the interaction dynamics on the creation process\n\nIt’s a typical thing mentioned by our authors, that sometimes they just cannot find the “Back“ button to navigate to the last page.\n\nWe found out that most likely it’s because of **the inconsistency** of the backward logic.\n\nThe current creation process is split into 2 pages: the main body of proposal, and the Choice form. While the interface has a different logic in these 2 consecutive pages, it can create kind of loss in user’s consciousness.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we should **add the “←Back“ button** to each of the creation page to bridge that inconsistency.\n\n![Inconsistency: Proposal Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0DX2Kw1zvXa3zZIu9cvTa.png?height=180&width=1253)\n\n![Inconsistency: Choice Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyODQDIYrVLQE9ycTV0Xm.png?height=203&width=1228)\n\n### 4. Integrate notification bells into one within the app\n\nI noticed that Snapshot now has a full list of notification methods we can choose from: HAL, discord bot, epns, webhooks… The notification bell within the space page seems a little outdated, and our members are often confused at what these two bells represent for respectively.\n\nIt spent me a while to get to understand that they actually control different ways of notification, but this also creates a sort of fragmentation within UI. Imagining one wants to turn off notification messages from a specific space he joins in the upper right dropdown list, there’s no way to do so, and the bell below the space name won’t work either, but to switch to another notifiation type.\n\nIMHO, we can make this page much neater by **integrating** the left notication bell with the newer one, and after that it will only point to one type of notification where user can actually control to accept a specific range of space messages.\n\n![two similar bells](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ujtOy7j3fj90TsTHabvT.png?height=426&width=1355)\n\n### 5. Highlight voting types\n\nPastachiodao is a very good example that I use it every time when I try to teach new members who are going to cast their fist votes.\n\nBut sometimes when new members flood in, it’s inevitable someone doesn’t fully comprehend the meaning of the voting system or just neglect the voting type the proposal is using since it’s just placed in the upper right corner of the page.\n\nI’m thinking of a way just like what Pastachiodao did. But differently I want the ‘‘demo’’ directly embedded within a proposal in the simple form like **a short explained hint**, to remind the users which voting type they are acting on, to let them know they can actually choose one more options in an “approval voting” type. I can’t help thinking it because it would be a great attempt to further ‘‘educate’’ our users the knowledge of snapshot in a very practical way.\n\nIt can be in the choice form section **beside ‘“cast your vote“**, indicating a voting type.\n\n![a hint beside \"Cast your vote\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6N3uMa5G1q-rVr39Sqzt.png?height=421&width=790)\n\n### 6. Make visible the bottom bar in the homepage\n\nThe bottom bar provides essential information like official contact, display mode, language setting and official tutorials.\n\nThese elements are highly useful and should be **available at anytime** at least in the homepage. (experience from other well-known projects)\n\nHowever, if one hits the “load more” button, it just keeps loading down forever until all spaces will show up, and the bottom bar containing these information just keep **“blipping“** on each loading. One has to refresh the page to get it back to the original state.\n\nTo keep the bottom bar at a certain visibility level, I can think of 3 options:\n\n1. Pin the bottom bar like “freeze panes” in an excel, so loading will not break its existence.\n2. Add a load limit, like 50 spaces/load, after that, one has to retrigger the load manually.\n3. Keep it as it was. But after one hits the “load more” button and the load starts looping, one will be able to return back the state by hitting “snapshot“ in the top bar or “⚡“ in the sidebar.\n\n![Blip on each \"load more\"...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fTeNuFG5QZzzfxItSeGXw.png?height=219&width=1273)\n\n### 7.  Optimize the experience of edit box\n\nWe usually tweak our strategies in the UI, its original edit box. But the experience is not good, especially for a long code, every time an input will **bring the whole page to the top**, again and again, it brings us headache since we just **lost** where we were in the middle of job. I believe the issue also happens in any edit box like a plugin modal, or the playground…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DokWdmd9oj0EsZkKiZ7k.png?height=680&width=562)\n\n### 8. Strategy reuse\n\nFor different proposal types, we have different strategies to apply.\n\nWe know snapshot doesn’t allow the author to choose arbitrary strategies at his will. We successfully manage it at the admin level, to centralize the use of strategies.\n\nBut as such, we’re also considering for a DAO which has a pool of 10 strategies (and we use it on rotation like 3-4 strategies a time), if we can make things more efficient by keeping those **strategies temporarily not in use** in an “**inactive state”** rather than just deleting them and re-adding them back when it comes to use again?\n\nTherefore we don’t bother to write them again and can bring them back with just a click, which provides much more flexibility.\n\n![Adding a disable button besides delete?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0E6joStNfYGl_uYNbV-Zp.png?height=402&width=771)\n\n### 9. Preserve the input state of the keywords on strategies section\n\nThe number of snapshot’s strategies is exploding, which is good! However sometimes we can hardly tell the exact function of a strategy by its name and have to click in and run a test one by one.\n\nIt’s somewhat inconvenient when we click the return button, and it brings us to the whole list of strategy after we find out it’s not our strategy, we have to **input the keywords  again** to filter to the target lists.\n\nI wish the app can remember the state of our input keywords when we return to the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LWmGGniXeLhjlpBO-Pid6.png?height=290&width=1306)\n\nThanks for reading all the way through, hereby I give my best wishes to snapshot’s future as well as my community！❤", "timestamp": 1653372728, "digest": "XUFYktLBZvMnbNVihV84Iq0xq0hafZ_Rl8FbbO8uIKc", "contributor": "0x4F777E46C37fc4a2f70FdFB3a0A7C56C93EE82F0"}

Web3 的世界，有何方式可证明自己曾经历过什么呢？\n\n*作者：Crescent，律动 BlockBeats* \n  \n 毕业证书可以证明我们就读过的院校，奖励证书可以证明我们所获得的荣誉，专业技能证书可以证明自身的工作能力，这一张张的标签串联起来足以刻画出我们的生活轨迹。不止如此，游戏中我们拥有段位证明，工作中我们拥有经历证明，就连刷视频的时候也会被大数据推送符合我们兴趣偏好的内容，背后隐藏着我们的标记证明。 \n 千千万万人生活的轨迹，构成属于我们一串串的数据凭证，不过，这些凭证都被隔离在相对封闭数据库中。我们的学历证明存在于官方机构中，信贷记录存在于金融机构中，在一个 App 中的习惯仅在相关联之处体现。 \n 除了这些存在于我们的日常生活中的场景，在链上我们也需要这样的凭证。当用户在一些借贷项目中（如 AAVE 或 Compound）进行进行抵押贷款且及时归还，未被清算无任何不良记录时，这生成的凭证就记录并证明了该用户的良好信用。其他平台或借款人也可以凭此证明衡量借出款项的额度，风险性等因素。当用户在新项目启动后，有无参与，做过多少贡献，曾有过何种投票历史，用户的所有行为数据都也可以生成凭证，社区即可根据这些凭证按比例奖励贡献者。 \n 不过，当前机构间的封闭性导致这些信息并不对本该拥有这些数据的个人或需要这些数据的应用程序开放，这也造成了当前分裂的局面。 \n Project Galaxy 则想通过建立一个开放的凭证数据网络来帮助用户解决当前问题。 \n  \n **Project Galaxy 在做什么** \n  \n Project Galaxy 想要通过链上、链下两个维度多个数据源搜集凭证数据，进行网络管理。其指出，对于链上凭证，策展人可以提供子图查询或静态快照。在链下，则已与 [http://Snapshot.org](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//Snapshot.org)、Twitter 和 Github 等数据源集成。 \n 通过这些凭证数据，Project Galaxy 构建了一个基于 Web3 DID（Decentralized ID 去中心化身份）系统。像上文所说，我们当前的身份系统是分裂的，不同中心化网站上有不同的身份系统，用户每使用一个新的网站后都需要注册一个账户（如微信、淘宝），随着身份的逐渐增多，给用户带来许多不便。不过演化到现在，许多网站已经可以提供第三方登录，但是我们的身份系统还未统一，也就是说我们不能凭借一个账号，只用一个身份系统，登录所有网站，汇集所有痕迹。 \n  \n **Galaxy ID 代表了什么** \n  \n Project Galaxy 想构建的就是这样一个系统，用户拥有的 Galaxy ID 相当于用户通用的用户名，通过 Galaxy ID 将凭证串联起来，形成一个凭证数据网络。用户将其钱包链接到官网后即可生成 Galaxy ID，在此 ID 上会根据用户的历史行为，自动显示出「Uniswap V3 交易员」、「OpenSea 交易员」等标签，且用户还可通过 Galaxy ID 显示出在 Web3 世界中收集的凭据，如 NFT 徽章，彰显出自身的历史成就。 \n 由用户自己控制自己的身份，可以做到自己进行认证，自己进行授权，而不是由权威机构从中控制。目标类似成为成为链上 LinkedIn。 \n 用户每次与 Galaxy Protocol 交互，都会被收取平台费用，但目前 Beta 测试期间免费。一般情况下用户需要支付 Gas 费才能申领和铸造 NFT，不过 Galaxy 也支持活动发行者代表用户支付交易费用，从而实现无 Gas 铸造。 \n 当凭证用于 Galaxy 的应用程序模块、凭证 Oracle 引擎和凭证 API 时，也就是说数据被用户使用后，也会给予策展人一定的奖励。 \n \n\n \n 开发者可以集成 Galaxy ID 工具包，并根据用户的链上凭证为用户提供定制的功能。目前 Cyberconnect、Unipass 和 Salad Venture 等项目已经在其产品中进行使用。 \n  \n 可通过该平台构建和分发 NFT 徽章 \n  \n Project Galaxy 可以为开发人员提供应用程序模块、凭证 Oracle 引擎和凭证 API，开发人员可以利用凭证数据来构建更好的产品和社区。 \n 简单来说，就是其他项目方可通过 Project Galaxy 的 NFT 基础设施与链上凭证数据网络构建和分发 NFT 徽章，来对社区成员进行管理。官方称之为 Galaxy OAT（链上成就代币），这记录了用户的所有成就。 \n 就如笔者在「[Salad Ventures 项目介绍](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.theblockbeats.info/news/29297)」中提到的，Salad Ventures 就是通过与 Project Galaxy 进行合作，使 Scholar 达到每种成就可以铸造相应的 NFT 徽章，通过 GalaxyID 展示，把其作为 Gamefi 宇宙身份贯穿其整个职业生涯。在这里用户的每一种成就都可被铸造成一枚枚 NFT 徽章。比如在游戏中，用户达到了多少胜率，即可铸造一种徽章，在交易上，铸造作为 Uniswap V3 交易员的徽章，或者在生活中曾购买哪场音乐会门票、参加过什么样的活动，都可以铸造成 NFT 徽章展示出来。Galaxy 表示 Galaxy OAT 是用户一生所有成就的数字记录。 \n 整体创建流程也比较简单，活动组织者只需要提交参数和徽章设计就能创建活动和凭证，供用户参与，所有 OAT NFT 的元数据都将存储在由 IPFS 和 Filecoin 提供支持的 NFT.Storage 上。 \n \n\n \n 官方表示迄今为止，已有 100 多个合作伙伴在 Project Galaxy 上发起了 500 多个活动。 \n  \n 经济模型 \n  \n GAL 为该项目的原生 Token，总量为 2 亿枚。 \n \n\n \n 在其 Token 分配中： \n 生态系统占比：6% \n 前期参与者占比：2% \n CoinList 公募占比：5% \n 第一轮增长支持者占比：10.63% \n 第二轮增长支持者占比：10.14% \n 投资顾问与合作伙伴占比：6.23% \n 市场营销占比：15% \n 基金会占比：10% \n 团队占比：15% \n 社区金库占比：20% \n 下图为其释放路径： \n \n\n \n GAL 不仅可以用于 Galaxy DAO 项目中的投票和治理，还是 Project Galaxy 生态系统的主要支付 Token。比如在治理中，Token 持有者可以控制平台收取的费用以及社区金库的资金。在支付中，开发人员需要使用应用程序模块以及 Galaxy 凭证数据时，以 GAL 作为费用进行支付。大部分费用将归策展人所有，其余部分费用则会收取到社区金库中。开发人员需要通过 Galaxy Oracle Engine 和 Galaxy Credential API 查询我们的凭证数据时，也需要用 GAL 付费。 \n  \n 项目背景 \n  \n Project Galaxy 前段时间宣布完成 1000 万 美元融资，其中有许多知名投资方，由 Multicoin Capital 和 Dragonfly Capital 领投，Spartan Group、Sky9 Capital、Coinbase Ventures、Binance Smart Chain Growth Fund、C-Squared Ventures、Lattice Capital、Mirana Ventures、Folius Ventures、Solana Ventures、Jump Capital、Alameda Research 等参投。资金将用于扩大对多个数据源的支持，继续构建应用模块，发展凭证数据网络。 \n Project Galaxy 由 Harry 与 Charles 联合创立，两者分别在 2016-2017 年以及 2017-2018 年担任过伯克利中国企业家协会 (ACE) 主席。 \n \n\n \n Harry Zhang 是该项目的联合创始人兼项目负责人。Harry 曾做过 Club Factory（当时印度第三大电子商务平台）的数据产品负责人。 \n 步入区块链领域后 Harry 担任过 Lino Network 的联合创始人兼首席运营官，以及 [http://DLive.tv](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//DLive.tv) 的联合创始人，带领团队打造了每月为超过 1000 万活跃用户提供服务的产品。 \n \n\n \n Charles Wayn 是 Project Galaxy 的联合创始人兼战略主管。Charles 曾在 [http://DLive.tv](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//DLive.tv) 担任联合创始人兼首席执行官。在 2019 年 DLive 并入 BitTorrent 后，Charles 成为了 BitTorrent 互动娱乐副总裁，管理包括 [http://DLive.tv](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//DLive.tv)、DLive Protocol 和 Two App 在内的多个流媒体业务部门。 \n  \n 总结 \n  \n 目前该项目支持 Ethereum、Polygon、Fantom、Solana、BNB Chain、Arbitrum 和 Avalanche 七条公链。 \n 这些用户行为数据形成的凭证大有用处，相当于自身的个人简历标记用户着曾获得的成就。对于普通用户来说，可以使他人可通过用户过去的成就更加了解自己。对于开发者来说，除了上文举例的评判信用进行发放贷款、公会凭借凭证招纳人才之外，还可奖励社区贡献者。以及根据用户的具体行为，对用户有一个基础判断，从而准确的定位到目标客户。 \n Web3 凭证数据网络和 DID 系统在区块链开发的项目中并不多见，但是我们还是存在这样的需求。这样一个系统出现，对于开发者或者是用户来说无疑非常方便。 \n 当今的 DID 项目如 Civic、uPort（现在已演变为 Veramo 和 Serto），多注重匿名验证以及安全性，应用场景在物理世界中居多，如为自动售货机进行匿名年龄验证，或对用户进行 KYC 验证等。而 Project Galaxy 带给人的体验多倾向于身份认证与 NFT 的结合，再加上他的许多应用模块，给链上世界提供了一定的基础设施，是开发者可以进行 Galaxy OATs、NFT 忠诚度计划、定制治理等，更适用于社区管理。 \n 使用策展人提供的数据可以使策展人得到回报，在一定程度上激励更多策展人参与，这又会增加 Project Galaxy 的信息覆盖范围，促使其 Web3 凭证数据网络更加强大，吸引更多的开发者使用该网络数据，形成一个正向循环。 \n

The national and international markets are regulated by Governments, while voluntary markets are not. The market is dominated by activity from voluntary standards.\n\nOffset issuance and number of projects registered by mechanism\n\n**Regulated Markets**\n\nThe regulated offset markets consist of domestic crediting regimes as well as multilateral mechanisms (such as the erstwhile [Clean Development Mechanism or CDM](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/mechanisms-under-the-kyoto-protocol/the-clean-development-mechanism)). The issuance of offsets in domestic trading mechanisms increased by [25% in 2020 (compared to 2019),](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35620) led by the California Compliance Offset Program and the Australia Emissions Reduction Fund. While CDM is being phased out to give way for a new international mechanism.\n\nCDM was a cap-and-trade scheme that was established under the Kyoto Protocol. It allowed governments or private entities in industrialized countries (Annex I) to implement emission saving projects in developing countries (Annex II). This helped the Annex I countries to meet their emission quota while the Annex II countries got the needed finance to kickstart climate friendly projects. At present the provision of a multilateral cap and trade scheme is encapsulated in the Article 6 of the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement). The [COP 26](https://unfccc.int/conference/glasgow-climate-change-conference-october-november-2021) finally saw countries coming together to agree on its implementation.\n\n**Voluntary Markets**\n\nThe share of voluntary carbon projects and offsets is increasing in the overall offset market. **[In 2015, voluntary crediting mechanisms contributed less than 20% to the annual issuances. This number increased to over 50% in 2019](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33809/9781464815867.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y)**. In 2021, [the voluntary carbon markets have already recorded a growth of over 60% over the last year](https://www.ecosystemmarketplace.com/articles/press-release-voluntary-carbon-markets-rocket-in-2021-on-track-to-break-1b-for-first-time/#:\\~:text=In%20the%20first%20eight%20months,goals%2C%20a%20new%20report%20finds.). This indicates that many more organizations and individuals are resorting to voluntarily offsetting, by using independent crediting mechanisms. To keep up with the 1.5**°**C pathway the global demand for voluntary carbon offsets (resulting from a carbon asset) needs to increase by at least[ 15X by 2030 and 100X by 2050. Or from 100 million offsets in 2020 to at least 1.5–2 bn in 2030.](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/a-blueprint-for-scaling-voluntary-carbon-markets-to-meet-the-climate-challenge)\n\nVoluntary carbon credit demand scenarios (GtCO2e/year)\n\nWithin the voluntary carbon offset markets, the largest share of offsets is issued under the VCS framework of Verra, making these offset types the most liquid and widely traded.\n\n \n PS: This is from the blog I wrote for my venture OffsetFam.

{"id": "Ca9LUxn7XuWB--zBhFSo6YgL7vwprhXq1OEV4aNNIto", "title": "你了解区块链该读的第一篇文章：区块链将如何改变世界？", "body": "想象一下：我们重新回到金本位的世界，然后把每个人拥有的黄金数量都记录在支付宝里，我们买东西和转账都通过这个黄金支付宝来完成，而实物黄金被我们藏在一个谁也找不到的地方。\n\n这就是数字货币试图为我们描述的世界，有一种不依赖国家主权的物品（这里是黄金）充当一般等价物，你会发现其实这个一般等价物是什么并不重要，历史上也出现过白银甚至贝壳充当一般等价物的情况，当然，它也可以是比特币，真正重要的是，这个一般等价物要被大家所接受。\n\n但是数字货币的世界还是有点不同，在数字货币的世界中，并不存在支付宝，而是存在一套系统，它不属于任何人或公司，由多数人共同维护和控制，可以免费的帮我们记录资产和交易，而且从来不会犯错，也无法被攻击。这个系统就是区块链。\n\n## 怎么可能有人接受比特币？\n\n问出这个问题，显然你还没有接受比特币，这并不奇怪，这个世界的大多数人都没有接受比特币，但是当然也有一部分人选择了接受比特币，例如微软公司就接受比特币支付。目前比特币总价值超过了100亿美元，单个比特币的价格在3800元人民币左右。\n\n比特币并不是一夜之间获得现在的接受程度的，事实上从比特币面世到现在经历了近8年的时间，在2010年的时候产生了第一笔比特币交易，当时一个人用一万个比特币买了一个披萨（现在看这可能是有史以来最贵的披萨），所以比特币有一个逐渐被接受的过程，因此正确的问题应该是，到底是什么促进了比特币被接受？\n\n显然世界上最初没有比特币，产生比特币的过程被称为挖矿，你可以把它想象成开采黄金。不过比特币的挖矿是一个比拼算数题的过程，系统会为所有正在挖矿的计算机出一道数学题，谁先做出了这道题，谁就获得了比特币。影响挖矿产出的因素主要是算力，算力越高的机器挖出比特币的概率就越大。\n\n和开采黄金一样，比特币的挖矿也有成本，需要消耗电力和磨损硬件，现在用普通计算机挖矿，消耗的资源大概是挖出比特币价值的十倍，所以想通过挖矿致富的小伙伴可以洗洗睡了。真正专业的矿场多数都建在水电站的旁边，低成本的获得能源，并且会对软硬件进行优化，关于挖矿的更多细节，[可以参考这篇文章](http://www.jpm.cn/article-2296-1.html)。\n\n回到我们的问题，比特币是如何流行的？答案是，不同时期挖矿的效率是不同的，在早期参与挖矿的机器少，竞争也比较少，更容易挖出比特币，当然这个时候比特币并不值钱，早期参与挖矿的也都是一些极客，他们通常都有这样的预期：比特币在未来将会更流行。\n\n**流通本身会带来价值**，在我们开头黄金的例子中，其实我们把黄金藏起来并不影响人们使用电子黄金进行交易，也就是说大家看重的不是黄金的价值，而是其作为价值载体的流通价值。从经济学的角度说，挖矿的供给是相对稳定的，更广泛的流通意味着有更多的人和场景需要比特币，而需求的增加将推升比特币价格。\n\n也就是说，如果你认为比特币会更流行，比特币的价格就存在上涨的预期，于是就会有更多的人参与挖矿，也会有人参与投机，总之会有越来越多的人参与进来，这一过程又促进了比特币价格上涨，形成一个正反馈的循环，比特币的早期参与者也因此获益。\n\n当然真实情况要复杂的多，另外一个重要的因素是，需要不断有人开拓比特币支付的场景，让更多的商家接受比特币支付，这样才能真正促进比特币作为货币的流通，不过其实问题的关键，还是让更多的人了解和接受比特币和数字货币的概念。\n\n## 没有支付宝，数字货币如何被记录？\n\n这里我们需要来解释一下区块链和比特币的关系，上面讲到，比特币挖矿是一个比拼算数学题的过程，在系统的设计中，每当比特币被挖到的时候，同时会产生一个叫做区块的东西，每个区块会记录从上一个区块产生到目前的所有比特币交易。\n\n除此之外，每个区块还有一个头部和尾部，其功能是通过密码学的原理，把相邻的区块连接起来，形成区块链，实现的效果是，如果某个区块的内容被篡改，就会与其相邻的区块产生冲突，进而被发现。\n\n区块链的设计机制是只有最长的链是有效的，假设有一个坏节点希望篡改区块链的内容，它无法改变某个单独的区块，只能争取产生新的假区块，这就需要和全网所有其他节点对抗，所以如果这个节点拥有超过全网50%的运算能力，就能实现对区块链进行控制，专业术语叫做算力攻击。\n\n目前比特币系统已经遍布全球，很难对其进行算力攻击，即使真的有人能做到，付出的成本也大于获得的价值，这就从经济学的角度杜绝了算力攻击。随着比特币网络越来越大，其价值会越来越高，但相应其算力也会越来越高，从而维持了这一平衡。\n\n**事实上区块链是一套去中心化的记账系统**。一般对于记账系统来说，记账行为和数据存储都是中心化的，去中心化记账相当于把账本分别存储在不同的地方，同时又由不同的人来记账，于是如何解决记账一致性的问题就是关键所在。\n\n区块链技术的特别之处，就在于通过竞争记账（算数学题）的方式，巧妙的解决了这一问题。当一个节点算出了数学题，可以迅速的向其他节点进行验证，当足够多的节点承认了这一结果后，系统就会进行确认，这就既避免了需要一个中心化的权威机构来做判断，又防止了恶意节点的操纵。\n\n## 区块链将如何改变世界？\n\n现在终于可以回答我们题目的问题，区块链将如何改变世界？读到这你有没有发现，如果我们接受了基于区块链的数字货币，其实我们就不需要银行了？事实上你也不会听说任何比特币银行。\n\n区块链对银行的替代作用和支付宝对银行的替代作用有相似的地方，我们把钱存在银行，无非出于3个原因：利息、安全、更方便的支付，这些功能支付宝都具备，而区块链具备后两者，不过财富管理带来的收益可以替代利息收益。\n\n无论是支付宝还是银行，都是中心化的记账系统，当我们使用非现金的方式付账的时候，需要有一个权威的记账机构，向商家证明我们的账户里真的有钱，并且帮我们把钱转付给商家。银行作为记账机构的权威性来自国家监管的背书，而我们相信支付宝是因为阿里巴巴的信用和技术能力。\n\n但是这样一个记账中介的存在产生了巨大的成本，想一想银行有多少线下网点，有多少服务人员吧。此外，每个银行都会有自己的 IT 记账系统，用户在支付和转账的时候，就会在银行间形成交易，分别被两个银行记录，这就涉及到对账和结算的问题。\n\n国内的交易还好说，因为有央行作为权威机构，在银行间进行清算，但是国际交易因为没有权威机构作为中介，各国的清算系统和流程又有很大差异，导致交易变得十分麻烦。\n\n区块链的解决方式是去中心化的，所有的交易都被公开的记录在区块链上，这就省去了对账的麻烦，跨国的交易也不需要等到当天银行结算后完成，而是可以实时到账。目前国际清算每笔的成本约26美元，如果区块链得以应用，仅此一项每年节约的费用就在数十甚至上百亿美元。\n\n更进一步来说，整个金融体系就是一个信任体系，原本这一体系是通过国家背书、金融监管的方式建立信任，**而区块链的出现，是用技术的手段解决了信任问题，从而对现有的金融系统提出了一套成本更低的替代解决方案**。\n\n再举一个例子，我们在交易所交易股票需要支付手续费，以覆盖交易所和证券体系运行的成本。但是如果区块链可以记录所有的股票交易，理论上我们也不再需要交易所了。按照A股每天2000亿交易额，平均交易成本万分之五计算，仅仅中国的股票交易，每天将节约成本1亿元。\n\n当一个行业成本结构发生变化的时候，往往会出现剧烈的变革，从这个角度来说，区块链将会重塑金融行业。全球金融行业每年的产值在数万亿美元，任何一个细分领域的应用，都将是一个庞大的市场。\n\n不仅如此，区块链创造的可信任的记账体系还有很多其他应用，例如记录影视、音乐、出版等行业的版权和交易；记录数字资产的发行；记录病史和就医情况，方便医生了解病人情况；记录供应链各个环节的生产，从而实现供应链的溯源，防止假货的产生等等。\n\n区块链向我们展示了一个所有资产都将被数字化的世界，在一个价值的互联网上，资产的转移将像今天信息的传递一样快捷、方便、便宜。不知道写到这里，你是不是还认为我在描述一个未来世界？在这里借用威廉·吉布森的一句话来结尾：未来已来，只是尚未流行。", "timestamp": 1653373849, "digest": "mIiMTR98A6BAXkt9Z0JBmKciz9XTYrPThCrAo3g9RCA", "contributor": "0x91e41069F5300128bbdeed94659A3Fe28499FF1E"}

Mt's will re-define your social relationship graph. Mt's image tells us that when we started to enter the crypto world, many people are the watchers, they were or surprised, or skeptical, or excited, or afraid. However, as an objective rule, the arrival of anything new alway create chaos, some won, some lost, some waited and waited.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0AmbCbCggDrMmh6nH_Zvh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n### Participation\n\nMt's are issued in 12600 pieces. Every Mt's has its unique characteristics and rarity. Mt's will help you realize your social value, allowing you to gain fun and income from your social connections and behavior. Mt's wants to flip the NFT market with new form of energy. NFT shall not be the chips in the hand of the rich, at least that’s not Mt’s. Mt’s owners help each other in a way that no one has ever done.\n\nMt's will issue the first 50 pieces as the seed, half of which will be given as Whitelist to those who have participated and contributed in Mt’s early stages, the other half goes to the first official mint pool where everyone can participate.\n\nTo obtain the first 50 Mt’s are required to go to Mt’s website, log into personal page for the Invitation Code(IC). ICs are the permission to participate mint. Make sure IC in the pocket prior to each mint round.\n\nMt's mint uses an incremental model with an initial price of 0.09 ETH.  Totally 6\\*round mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kiQWX7xPDP5Em54uLfSrV.png?height=1434&width=2794)\n\n## Beyond the PFPs, go ride with mtier.\n\n### Mtier Rank Program\n\nIn order to promote Mt’s influence and build solid relationship among members, Mt’s has its unique incentive program, the Mtier Rank Program(MRP). Once user own Mt’s NFT, he/she becomes a mtier Noob. After completing 2\\*invites and both invitees successful mint Mt’s, mtier Noob go to the rank, the MRP automatically kicks in.\n\nEach mtier has his/her rank(except the Noob), ranks come with different allowances. \n MRP reward is made of two parts: Share reward and Royalties. \n Share reward is an invitation-oriented incentive.\n\n**i.g.** \n Mtier1 invites 2\\*mtier2 and both mtier2 sucessfully mint Mt’s NFT, mtier1 will gain 24% share reward from mtier2’s mint costs.  If mtier2 has his/her own 2\\*mtier3 minted Mt’s NFT, mtier2 will gain 24% share reward from mtier3’s mint costs, meanwhile mtier1 gains 12%  share reward from mtier3’s mint costs.\n\nAlso mtiers will gain 10% of the royalties when their Mt’s NFT in Opensea, etc. \n The specific allowance rate chart shows as following:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5jLNtGnQ7MdFkIxiQH2xx.png?height=1645&width=3761)\n\n### Funds Allocation\n\n**All mint funds will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 50.87% will go to Mtier Rank Program.  \n 24.13% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 25% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**Royalty income will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 2.49% will be awarded to all users holding NFT and participating in the invitation. \n 3% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 4.45% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**The Mt’s Community Treasury:**  \n 20% of the Foundation's funds will be used for acquisitions and marketing. \n 80% will be reserved for bonuses.\n\n\\*When only 5% of total market Mt's NFT are remained, all bonuses will be shared equally.\n\n### Mt's DAO\n\nAll users holding Mt's NFT are members of Mt's DAO. Mt's DAO members can vote in project decisions and can decide how to use bonuses and whether to acquire new NFTs. Mt's DAO will in future be involved and influence the development of Mt's NFT as the core decision maker of Mt's NFT.\n\n### Reward collection\n\nThe mtier who have activated the rewards, can collect them on Mt’s official website. In order to better motivate new comer, Mt's NFT has been reorganized on the collection mechanism-all Mt's NFT that has collected rewards will be automatically destroyed. This deflation mechanism can increase the value of retained Mt 's NFT. After destruction, designated mtier will receive a new vMt's NFT as a credential to record your existing social network.\n\n### vMt's NFT Function\n\nvMt's NFT is a derivative NFT after the original Mt's NFT is destroyed. 20% of vMt's NFT will be used as the seed for the next project and the rest can be redeemed for future CON LAB new projects. Holding vMt's NFT will also continue to maintain your existing social connections, meaning you will continue to increase the value  your social connections. Further more, Holding vMt's NFT will also give you the opportunity to receive token airdrops.\n\n### Mt's redefines NFT\n\n\"The next era will be defined by today's social networking sites and the depth of connection given to users, and our job is to find the best way for users to share themselves\" - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nThe value of relationships is based on the sharing economy, which means sharing one's state of being, one's information, one's interests, one's hobbies. The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing. Mt’s aims to build a perpetual social-fi  generator in Web3.\n\nThe CON LAB will create a decentralized NFT trading platform driven by influencers and the community through a perpetual network of social connections, with the proceeds of each transaction distributed to the platform's NFT holders to enjoy perpetual dividends and a true return of equity to the user.\n\n## What is Mt's\n\nThe Made-it's , The Miss-it's, The My-turn's\n\nThis was a great movement that will eventually be remembered in crypto history. Free from the interference of capitals and authorities. There are no losers in this movement.\n\nThis time we are not a bystander, we are expressing our emotions in a way that will influence more crypto practitioners.\n\nFrom this moment on, Mt's will change the world.\n\n### Follow Mt’s\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MtsNFTs)    |    [Disocrd](https://discord.gg/TK3VCgH4pR)    |    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUahYxfJ2xaB9W9js3ifWQ)\n\n## Don't wait&see, up with Mt’s.", "timestamp": 1653373740, "digest": "vyA5575rvQ7kbqkumCcLLXqMptIBWzFhFzwE4MfQexc", "contributor": "0x5b23A5d907805a4dcFBe13aE232442A6746c5C9C"}

As the contest plays out, a player may gain rewards and other progression-related qualities that can increase the effectiveness of their team.\n\n### Battle Rewards\n\nVictories will offer contestants a chance to win Ore and other possible rewards.\n\n### Tournaments & Battle Stones\n\nPaid Toumaments will be at the heart of Planet Mojo. By using Ore to craft Battle Stones (Tourmament Entry Tickets), players will have the opportunity to enter Tournaments with SMOJ and other rewards as prizes. The Battle Stones will be crafted NFTs, and thus sellable or shareable with others. \n\n### Free VS Owned\n\nPlanet Mojo will include a free to-play path for players who do not own a Mojo or Champions over time. This playmode will have some limits attached but still offer a robust venue for players wanting to test their skills and experience the Mojo Melee gameplay. Free players will be provided with a generic Team:\n\n\\-Limited character selection\n\\-Limited Level Progression\n\\-Ability to get into Tournaments based on certain criteria TBD.\n\n### Player Ranking\n\nThe Mojo Melee Ranking system will sort players based on the Trophies they earn for winning matches. The aim is to categorize players with similar skill and player levels in order to get more equitable contests. Ranking also provides an incentive for players to increase the value of their Battle Team.\n\n## Tokenomics\n\n### Token\n\n**-$MOJ**\n$Moj is the native ERC-20 Token of Planet Mojo. Everything between staking to in-game payments to governance will be used for $MOJ at a discount to the USDC rate of services.\n**-ORE**\nThe in-game utility & reward soft currency that allows players to upgrade their NFTs. Earned in Auto Chess.\n**-BATTLE STONES (NFTs)**\nBattle Stones are passes to get players into paid tournaments.

The Planet Mojo team is extremely honored to share their first INO sale experience with Polkastarter’s phenomenally experienced team and their dedicated and passionate community. Public Pre Sales rewards community loyalty by allowing them to buy a MOJO at discounted prices; before they become available publicly. Check out the project page for the incredible deal we are offering to our early supporters.\n\nMojo holders who have sprouted their Moj-Seeds will be automatically airdropped 4 of the initial 6 Champions randomly ahead of the game’s early release in the summer! To be clear, by minting and holding 1 Mojo, you will be airdropped 4 NFTS for free! You’ll receive 5 NFTs for the price of 1.\n\n## Community\n\nThe game's community is already of a certain size. In terms of the number of followers, 25k Twitter followers and 23k Discord subscribers are enough for the game to gain a firm foothold in the blockchain games, but in terms of engagement of the community, they are relatively inactive, so the game's community is large enough for it to attract some public attention, but it still needs the team to make the community active.\n\n## Team & Investors\n\nMystic Moose is the new company behind Planet Mojo and brings together an experienced group of game development and blockchain veterans from LucasArts, EA, Activision, HappyGiant and more.\n\nMystic Moose announced the closing of $5 million in venture capital and unveiled Planet Mojo.The award-winning Mystic Moose team is made up of gaming industry veterans with over 25 years experience from LucasArts, EA, Activision, and HappyGiant. The seed round is led by Animoca Brands, with participation from Courtside Ventures, Republic Crypto, Alameda, AU21, Sfermion, Polygon Studios, Collab+Currency, Sky Vision Capital, Spartan Capital, HyperEdge, Momentum6, Fourth Revolution Capital, and others. \n\n## Summary\n\nIn general, this is a game we can keep an eye on. Its game model is fresh and creative, which is why its community members have been consistently growing. On the other hand, its diverse economy system and value-added space is more interesting and attractive.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oqUJb1f7lkKjDlBPgIZsZ.png?height=151&width=512)\n\n**Author:** **@BitMetis** **| BitReport**\n\nYour Source of Reliable, Unbiased Research and Due Diligence\n\n**BitMetis Review：**\n\n**Gameplay：PvP Auto chess battler game**\n\n**Tokenomics: Diverse Mechanism,**\n\n**NFT：Normal  NFT mechanism, first NFT SALE on May 12, 2022**\n\n**Community：Enough member size but engagement is relatively inactive**\n\n**Investor & Team： Highly qualified team and strong-background investors**\n\n\n---\n\n*Please Note: the above content analysis is for Reference Only, not as a basis for investment decision-making.

Mt's will re-define your social relationship graph. Mt's image tells us that when we started to enter the crypto world, many people are the watchers, they were or surprised, or skeptical, or excited, or afraid. However, as an objective rule, the arrival of anything new alway create chaos, some won, some lost, some waited and waited.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0AmbCbCggDrMmh6nH_Zvh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n### Participation\n\nMt's are issued in 12600 pieces. Every Mt's has its unique characteristics and rarity. Mt's will help you realize your social value, allowing you to gain fun and income from your social connections and behavior. Mt's wants to flip the NFT market with new form of energy. NFT shall not be the chips in the hand of the rich, at least that’s not Mt’s. Mt’s owners help each other in a way that no one has ever done.\n\nMt's will issue the first 50 pieces as the seed, half of which will be given as Whitelist to those who have participated and contributed in Mt’s early stages, the other half goes to the first official mint pool where everyone can participate.\n\nTo obtain the first 50 Mt’s are required to go to Mt’s website, log into personal page for the Invitation Code(IC). ICs are the permission to participate mint. Make sure IC in the pocket prior to each mint round.\n\nMt's mint uses an incremental model with an initial price of 0.09 ETH.  Totally 6\\*round mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kiQWX7xPDP5Em54uLfSrV.png?height=1434&width=2794)\n\n## Beyond the PFPs, go ride with mtier!\n\n### Mtier Rank Program\n\nIn order to promote Mt’s influence and build solid relationship among members, Mt’s has its unique incentive program, the Mtier Rank Program(MRP). Once user own Mt’s NFT, he/she becomes a mtier Noob. After completing 2\\*invites and both invitees successful mint Mt’s, mtier Noob go to the rank, the MRP automatically kicks in.\n\nEach mtier has his/her rank(except the Noob), ranks come with different allowances. \n MRP reward is made of two parts: Share reward and Royalties. \n Share reward is an invitation-oriented incentive.\n\n**i.g.** \n Mtier1 invites 2\\*mtier2 and both mtier2 sucessfully mint Mt’s NFT, mtier1 will gain 24% share reward from mtier2’s mint costs.  If mtier2 has his/her own 2\\*mtier3 minted Mt’s NFT, mtier2 will gain 24% share reward from mtier3’s mint costs, meanwhile mtier1 gains 12%  share reward from mtier3’s mint costs.\n\nAlso mtiers will gain 10% of the royalties when their Mt’s NFT in Opensea, etc. \n The specific allowance rate chart shows as following:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5jLNtGnQ7MdFkIxiQH2xx.png?height=1645&width=3761)\n\n### Funds Allocation\n\n**All mint funds will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 50.87% will go to Mtier Rank Program.  \n 24.13% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 25% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**Royalty income will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 2.49% will be awarded to all users holding NFT and participating in the invitation. \n 3% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 4.45% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**The Mt’s Community Treasury:**  \n 20% of the Foundation's funds will be used for acquisitions and marketing. \n 80% will be reserved for bonuses.\n\n\\*When only 5% of total market Mt's NFT are remained, all bonuses will be shared equally.\n\n### Mt's DAO\n\nAll users holding Mt's NFT are members of Mt's DAO. Mt's DAO members can vote in project decisions and can decide how to use bonuses and whether to acquire new NFTs. Mt's DAO will in future be involved and influence the development of Mt's NFT as the core decision maker of Mt's NFT.\n\n### Reward collection\n\nThe mtier who have activated the rewards, can collect them on Mt’s official website. In order to better motivate new comer, Mt's NFT has been reorganized on the collection mechanism-all Mt's NFT that has collected rewards will be automatically destroyed. This deflation mechanism can increase the value of retained Mt 's NFT. After destruction, designated mtier will receive a new vMt's NFT as a credential to record your existing social network.\n\n### vMt's NFT Function\n\nvMt's NFT is a derivative NFT after the original Mt's NFT is destroyed. 20% of vMt's NFT will be used as the seed for the next project and the rest can be redeemed for future CON LAB new projects. Holding vMt's NFT will also continue to maintain your existing social connections, meaning you will continue to increase the value  your social connections. Further more, Holding vMt's NFT will also give you the opportunity to receive token airdrops.\n\n### Mt's redefines NFT\n\n\"The next era will be defined by today's social networking sites and the depth of connection given to users, and our job is to find the best way for users to share themselves\" - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nThe value of relationships is based on the sharing economy, which means sharing one's state of being, one's information, one's interests, one's hobbies. The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing. Mt’s aims to build a perpetual social-fi  generator in Web3.\n\nThe CON LAB will create a decentralized NFT trading platform driven by influencers and the community through a perpetual network of social connections, with the proceeds of each transaction distributed to the platform's NFT holders to enjoy perpetual dividends and a true return of equity to the user.\n\n## What is Mt's\n\nThe Made-it's , The Miss-it's, The My-turn's\n\nThis was a great movement that will eventually be remembered in crypto history. Free from the interference of capitals and authorities. There are no losers in this movement.\n\nThis time we are not a bystander, we are expressing our emotions in a way that will influence more crypto practitioners.\n\nFrom this moment on, Mt's will change the world.\n\n### Follow Mt’s\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MtsNFTs)    |    [Disocrd](https://discord.gg/TK3VCgH4pR)    |    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUahYxfJ2xaB9W9js3ifWQ)\n\n## Don't wait&see, up with Mt’s.", "timestamp": 1653373839, "digest": "vyA5575rvQ7kbqkumCcLLXqMptIBWzFhFzwE4MfQexc", "contributor": "0x5b23A5d907805a4dcFBe13aE232442A6746c5C9C"}

Factory基础设施的支持。欢迎通过文末方式提交DAO的研究，瓜分10000USDC赏金池！了解去中心化自治组织（DAO），探讨最新治理话题，关注DAO的发展趋势，欢迎加入DAOrayaki社区！\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bMHoErgF51zq9hJOhbLWR.png?height=375&width=1080)\n\n# 链下声誉是精英管理的关键\n\nDAO 或去中心化自治组织类似于企业，它通过代币化治理进行投票。如果你想加入一个 DAO，在公开市场上购买某些代币通常是唯一的资格。因为会员资格需要持有代币，所以持有更多代币的个人往往会产生更大的会员影响力，由此 DAO 通常将决策能力集中在其最大的代币持有者身上。\n\n这意味着你拥有的分配治理权的代币越多，你对DAO发展方向的影响越多。如果你更为富有，你将拥有更多的掌舵权，甚至即使再低最有资格的人施加影响的情况下，可能会为更好的决策提供信息，这就被称为DAO的富豪统治问题。\n\n一个富豪是一个精英统治阶级，其权力是从他们的财富的。根据代币持有比例分配投票权的 DAO 是财阀，在购买这些代币时更是如此（例如，与赚取的相反）。根据拥有的资产而不是专业知识来分配决策权，将导致 DAO 保持富豪统治，除非有关成员的合格数据变得更加具体。甚至 Vitalik Buterin最近也承认通过代币持有量分配投票治理权不灵活的缺点，这种方式可能会存在严重的不平等和激励失调，甚至它会导致黑客通过购买投票实现直接攻击。根据最富有的委员会的意见，Web3 不会通过实践设计而出类拔萃，但现在 DAO 缺乏灵活的工具来以自主、去中心化的方式记录声誉和资格。在这个系统中添加另一层——声誉——可以为合格的参与者创造更多空间，并为治理提供更公平的方法。\n\n我们不想将传统金融的富豪领导权换成类似集中的加密货币霸主。今天的 DAO 是美化的技术富豪。这种现实与 web3 的愿景和使命相去甚远；如果我们要实行任人唯贤，就不能依靠财富来分配治理角色。而如果我们现在不处理这个问题，它只会变得更加根深蒂固，难以修正。有一种方法可以解决这个问题：增加一层声誉，以重视财富之外的贡献和能力。此类个人数据需要脱链、动态且可验证，以创建去中心化的声誉。\n\n# DAO 成员可以建立股权和声誉（部分）\n\n随着智能合约为自动执行的业务和金融交易建立了模型，DAO 开始崭露头角。尽管早期的 DAO 模型在安全方面苦苦挣扎，但它们的灵活操作和最近在怀俄明州的政府接受预示着它们在基于任务的项目经济中的作用有前景。\n\nDAO 本身并不要求贡献者有正式的员工安排，而是让他们能够在项目上随意工作，同时获得奖励以换取工作贡献。DAO 提供了一个灵活的业务框架，如代码驱动的合作社，它提供了许多低风险、有偿的机会来获得 web3 生态系统的经验。贡献者不必全职受雇于任何项目，可以远程工作，并且可以从众多项目中获得报酬以换取有用的贡献。DAO 提供了个人贡献者能够获得成果股份的项目结构。当用户友好的工具使贡献者可以轻松分享成果时，自愿性、紧急性甚至是短暂的工作都可以得到认可。正如库珀·特利( Cooper Turley ) 最近在一次会议上所说的那样Bankless 播客上有关 DAO 的小组讨论，“DAO……是流动的。没有团队和用户动态；团队和社区是一体的。这允许人们以更自由流动的方式进入。使用 DAO，您不需要人力资源流程和具有归属时间表的多年合同。你可以加入并从今天开始贡献。”\n\nGitcoin DAO是将社区贡献代币化并将初始代币和治理权仔细分配给异常活跃的贡献成员的一个突出例子。然而，由于影响力的衡量标准（Gitcoin 代币）是可转移和半可替代的（非上下文），即使对于这种“fAirDrop”代币分配策略，DAO 富豪问题的解决仍然遥遥无期。Gitcoin 广泛选择的精英分布式 ——NFT 也受到同样的关注：它们是可交易的、链上的，从长远来看，这两者都使它们成为持久身份和声誉的不良候选人。此外，作为 web3 领域的多产参与者，Gitcoin DAO 的顶级贡献者在其他生态系统中没有任何价值。这真的公平和去中心化吗？幸运的是，Gitcoin团队已经在争取一个身份更为去中心化的未来。\n\n一些团队使用代币的基本经济特征来暗示声誉，例如代币锁定期和基于代币持有时间的加权投票权。例如，Popsicle Finance根据几个符合条件的钱包/代币特征创造性地分配投票权，包括基于代币持有时间的乘数。这些能力标志着区分 DAO 参与者任期的价值。\n\n没有去中心化的身份和声誉，每个 DAO 都必须独立验证每个成员的身份。如果成员资格基于技能和声誉，那么每个 DAO 必须分别集中验证该个人的身份。DAO 通常会接触不良的中心化代理，例如 Twitter。但是如果用户被锁定在他们的帐户之外，或者被影子禁止会发生什么？或者，如果某人的受信任 Twitter 身份是由另一个平台（例如 Discord）上的骗子执行的，那么不知情的用户可能会被骗。\n\nDAO 可能有逐步去中心化的计划，但没有语境身份和声誉的计划从本质上讲只是在重复 Web 2.0 的历史。依靠社交媒体帐户和集中身份代理作为解决方法并不能解决根本问题。\n\n# DAO 不是去中心化或自治的，所以股权是不稳定的\n\nDAO 旨在成为一种没有正式业务结构的、开销轻量级的协调机制。除了风险资本式的投资 DAO 之外，几乎没有任何 DAO 能够有效地实现这一结果，这些 DAO 将成员的资金集中用于集体投资。在ethCC会议上，NEAR Protocol 联合创始人 Illia Polosukhin 将所谓的 DAO 格局描述为“拥有银行账户的 Facebook 群组”——与 DAO 名称所暗示的自主主权相去甚远。甚至更复杂的 DAO 通常相当于由重叠的 web3 爱好者群体填充的代币Gateway Discord 频道。DAO 赋予的 Discord 角色标签作为去中心化声誉的孤立代理，链上交易历史提供了个人能力的狭隘视图。\n\n在投资型 DAO 中，主要活动是确定资本的使用。成员对 DAO 的出资允许他们就如何部署这些资金进行投票。此类 DAO 中的身份由您贡献了多少资本来定义，这是 DAO 成员针对此类追求的相关用户配置文件的范围。当用户都拥有能够就其财富进行交流的身份（例如以太坊地址）时，使用财富或代币持有量作为声誉的代理是有效的。这种方法在 ETH-maxi 未来最有效。鉴于DAO正在朝着强大的跨链生态系统发展，该系统可能不是最公平的。这也是为什么专注于财富分配的 DAO 似乎在技术上是最整合的；所需的会员资格，以及日常的财务参与活动，\n\n# 链上声誉的有限性和危险\n\n2017 年，ERC-735提出了链上凭证文件的提案，包括智能合约层中的数据。ERC-735 不适用于个人身份信息 (PII)，因此仅限于没有敏感数据的实体的身份。这样的提议很快就被取消了，因为链上的 PII 不允许自愿选择性披露和自我主权的身份。类似的提议正在重新出现，例如以太坊证明服务，它利用默认为公开且不可变的链上交易。但是，Serto 团队无法验证证明的存储位置或存在哪些界面供用户管理围绕其披露的同意。\n\n个人身份信息 (PII) 不属于区块链。如果隐私是公开的和不可改变的，那么它就不可能是灵活的、自愿的和不断发展的。将 PII 放在链上向受众公开数据，这些受众的范围比我们现在生活的监控资本主义的 web2.0 生态系统中的受众更为广泛。链上 PII 通常将声誉数据与单个地址相关联，从而限制了您可以轻松轮换密钥或使用与您生活的不同方面相关联的不同地址的程度。GDPR 和 CCPA 等法律与代表用户的公开的、不可更改的个人数据文件存在强烈冲突；根据这些规定，链上 PII 的程序化发布是非法的。出于这些原因，以太坊地址本身并不是灵活的上下文身份的基础（尽管是表示财富的好方法）。\n\nNFT 也是有缺陷的声誉代理，因为它们是链上的、公开的、不可变的，并且可以购买或交易。这凸显了广受喜爱的POAP 代币的一个缺点——这些 NFT 并不能证明 “你”参加了一个活动。它们只证明“某人”参加过，因为 POAP 很容易被赠送、购买或交易（就像所有 NFT 一样，除了不可转让的 NFT）。同样的缺点也适用于基于 NFT 的身份项目和使用 NFT 的基于角色的访问控制。\n\n不可转让的声誉 NFT 会带来更多的复杂性和更大灾难的机会。因为被锁定到了一个地址，因此即使是最认真的不可转让 NFT 也缺乏灵活性。幸运的是，不可转让的 NFT 非常少见，因为如果您的钱包收到包含非法内容的不可转让的 NFT，它将与您的钱包地址不可撤销地关联。拥有与您的地址相关联的不可移动的非法内容可能需要您迁移到一个新地址，并从头开始，留下您在那时累积的任何过去的钱包交易历史记录。\n\n带有非法内容的可转让 NFT 也可能对用户构成危险威胁，用户必须支付油费才能通过燃烧代币（将它们发送到 0x0 地址）来摆脱它们。将许多非法 NFT 发送给不知情的接收者将需要他们花费相应的燃油费用来销毁代币，或者放弃他们的钱包和从新地址开始的链上声誉。选择是明确的：除非您将钱汇入深渊或放弃您的交易历史，否则您将不得不遭受公共声誉的损害，并忍受与您的地址相关的未经同意的非法行为。\n\n将 NFT 用于链上声誉的挑战阐明了卓越的 DAO 原语：具有去中心化标识符 (DID) 和可验证凭证 (VC) 的去信任链外声誉。\n\n# DID 和 VC 是声誉的未来\n\n去中心化标识符 (DID)是由可以轮换的密钥对控制的一串数字和字母。可验证凭据 (VC)是由一个标识符对另一个标识符或某些其他事实或对象进行的证明。这些证明由他们的证明者加密签名，可撤销、链下、私有、可选择性披露并且可以设置为过期。\n\nDID 提供了一种灵活、直接的方式来签署链下证明，并且可以成为可验证凭证的主题。您还可以轻松地将多个社交标识符与 DID 连接起来，例如 Twitter 帐户、网站、Discord、Github——由3Box Profiles开创。与90+ DID方法通常与清晰普遍分解器，的DID是用于管理上下文数据链无关的解决方案。DID 可以将任何区块链的公共地址（或任何其他类型的公共标识符）转换为可以管理自身数据的系统无关标识符。\n\n可验证凭证是 DID 发布的签名数据的有形单位。VC 可以存储在本地，在某些情况下甚至可以在没有互联网访问的情况下进行验证。VC 越来越受欢迎，成为 Apple 医疗记录和 IBM COVID-19 凭证的首选防篡改标准。\n\n# DAO 之间的可移植身份和声誉\n\n**多重签名验证演示**\n\n任何人都不应该能够在 DAO 中做主，因此任何人都不应该能够代表 DAO 发布声誉。DAO 授予的凭证也应获得多方的批准（例如，DAO 成员资格证明或设计贡献证明应由 DAO 中的多方签署）。DAO 可以定义哪些凭证和哪些签名可以一起生成可验证的信誉单元。\n\n可验证的代表制是通过多个签名实现这种声誉证明的一种方式。这些证明要求将一组凭证一起提供以实现验证。例如，DAO 会员徽章可能采用可验证的展示形式，其中来自 DAO 成员的多个 VC 都证明了您的会员资格（例如 Alice 是信誉良好的会员）。如果指定方的法定人数（例如 BanklessDAO 的 5 个成员）证明了同一条数据（例如 Alice 是 BanklessDAO 中信誉良好的成员），那么 Alice 可以共享她的 DAO 成员身份可验证的演示文稿，例如其他 DAO 的成员身份证明或可以独立验证的人。\n\n由于可验证表示具有来自多方的签名，因此它可能被称为“多重签名”可验证表示，类似于需要多方批准才能批准给定交易的钱包的方式，类似的多重批准者功能用于链下数据可以被描述为使用 W3C 标准的可验证表示以及签名者的子集（n 的 m 个）甚至完整的（n 个）签名者集。多重签名可验证的代表制将允许 DAO 参与集体声誉的建立，并从 DAO 本身发布可验证的演示文稿。与从 DAO 分配资金的多重签名钱包一样，多重签名可验证的演示文稿也可以类似地从 DAO 分配声誉。\n\n在新公司证明自己的艰巨任务使许多人从事令人不满意的工作，并被在新环境中重建声誉的前景所吓倒。这种压抑的转换成本导致劳动力市场效率低下，并阻碍了角色之间的轻松转换。为了为自由市场提供有效的基础设施，转换工作的成本必须直线下降。当员工想要离职从事不同的工作时，当转换成本为零时，我们可以创造更有效的市场。\n\n这种互操作性可以为加入新的DAO用户节省大量时间，这种可移植的声誉在一个上下文中生成并在另一个上下文中得到验证。今天，DAO 成员每次加入一个新的 DAO 时都必须从头开始，不管他们在其他地方展示了什么样的技能。更自动化的 DAO 录取流程可以允许某些凭证的持有者自动被录取。这个未来的DAO允许成员从其他的DAO，WEB3环境或生态系统存在的信誉申请入会（如代码贡献胚根，参与Gitcoin，子补充和元数据的图形网络， 出席复康等）。\n\n**基于 VP 的 DAO 录取的验证过程可以：**\n\n检查 DAO 智能合约以识别规范签名者（例如 Gnosis Safe 合约上的 5 个签名者）\n\n检查给定的可验证演示文稿是否包含由来自该 DAO 合同的签名者的足够子集（例如 5 个中的 3 个）签名的可验证凭据\n\n如果经过验证，则允许个人参与 DAO\n\n新成员可以在第 0 天被分配到新 DAO 中的角色、机会和责任，而无需尽力攀登社会阶梯和向 Discord 渠道展示价值的劳动。未来的工作看起来不像是一个低效的劳动力市场，人们需要在每个新环境中证明自己，但这就是目前加入新 DAO 的现实。便携式工作证明可以消除在每个新环境或 DAO 中从头开始建立可信度的需要。\n\n加入后，个人将能够通过为 DAO 做出积极贡献来获得声誉凭证，然后将能够将这种声誉带到另一个 DAO，在那里他们从事其他项目并添加更多凭证。可移植性促进了跨 DAO 声誉，自由流动的数据可能为更多方与该数据交互提供机会（因此强调了对隐私、安全和同意的需求）。在数据主体同意和隐私是优先事项的更加自主的未来中，必须通过 DID 和 VC 将数据可验证地脱链移动。另一种选择是将声誉放在链上，如上所述，这可能会产生许多危险的后果（并且非常昂贵！）。\n\n将一个 DAO 的凭证用于另一个 DAO 的能力，这反映了我们已经通过集中身份和声誉证明享有的声誉可移植性。因为 VC 可以证明各种个人数据，包括各个级别的KYC所需的数据（了解您的客户——与识别个人客户相关的流程和数据，在传统金融中很常见），我们可以使用 VC 来启用便携式 KYC 并避免敏感个人数据的重复副本。欧盟监管沙箱中的 Alastria 项目为这种声誉可移植性铺平了道路。在更传统的情况下，信用卡和水电费账单等身份证明相当于申请图书证时的居住证明。像公共图书馆这样的组织已经决定信用卡对账单和水电费账单有资格作为有效的身份证明，因此他们将给定声誉资产的信任锚委托给另一个机构（例如公用事业和信用卡公司），并将它们指向为居住的代理。\n\n# DAO 去中心化的上限\n\n我们渴望能够解决复杂协调问题的 DAO，例如创建产品并将其推向市场。与资本分配不同，运输产品需要具有不同专业知识的各种不同角色，这些角色必须进行协调。同样与财务 DAO 不同的是，运输产品所需的人员和角色不可替代。\n\n对于尝试完成复杂协调任务的 DAO来说，成员技能和经验对于分配职责至关重要。不同角色之间真正复杂的协调依赖于声誉系统。如上所述，去中心化 DAO 工具针对资本分配进行了优化，因此唯一能够真正实现 DAO 化并仅凭基于钱包的声誉的公司就是国债。\n\nDAO 与分配资金的财富越不相似，DAO 的去中心化程度就越低，因为它必须依赖中心化工具来传递声誉信号。这个明显的上限限制了 DAO 的增长和去中心化，希望能够超越国库。想要做的不仅仅是资本分配的 DAO 注定要依赖中心化的工具和链上身份，直到他们接受去中心化的身份和声誉。\n\n\n---\n\n通过

{"id": "rM0WUT0MM6LnEOJfZv1lhzCMr7dgc8SB3ughXE2Axu8", "title": "你了解区块链该读的第一篇文章：区块链将如何改变世界？", "body": "想象一下：我们重新回到金本位的世界，然后把每个人拥有的黄金数量都记录在支付宝里，我们买东西和转账都通过这个黄金支付宝来完成，而实物黄金被我们藏在一个谁也找不到的地方。\n\n这就是数字货币试图为我们描述的世界，有一种不依赖国家主权的物品（这里是黄金）充当一般等价物，你会发现其实这个一般等价物是什么并不重要，历史上也出现过白银甚至贝壳充当一般等价物的情况，当然，它也可以是比特币，真正重要的是，这个一般等价物要被大家所接受。\n\n但是数字货币的世界还是有点不同，在数字货币的世界中，并不存在支付宝，而是存在一套系统，它不属于任何人或公司，由多数人共同维护和控制，可以免费的帮我们记录资产和交易，而且从来不会犯错，也无法被攻击。这个系统就是区块链。\n\n## 怎么可能有人接受比特币？\n\n问出这个问题，显然你还没有接受比特币，这并不奇怪，这个世界的大多数人都没有接受比特币，但是当然也有一部分人选择了接受比特币，例如微软公司就接受比特币支付。目前比特币总价值超过了100亿美元，单个比特币的价格在3800元人民币左右。\n\n比特币并不是一夜之间获得现在的接受程度的，事实上从比特币面世到现在经历了近8年的时间，在2010年的时候产生了第一笔比特币交易，当时一个人用一万个比特币买了一个披萨（现在看这可能是有史以来最贵的披萨），所以比特币有一个逐渐被接受的过程，因此正确的问题应该是，到底是什么促进了比特币被接受？\n\n显然世界上最初没有比特币，产生比特币的过程被称为挖矿，你可以把它想象成开采黄金。不过比特币的挖矿是一个比拼算数题的过程，系统会为所有正在挖矿的计算机出一道数学题，谁先做出了这道题，谁就获得了比特币。影响挖矿产出的因素主要是算力，算力越高的机器挖出比特币的概率就越大。\n\n和开采黄金一样，比特币的挖矿也有成本，需要消耗电力和磨损硬件，现在用普通计算机挖矿，消耗的资源大概是挖出比特币价值的十倍，所以想通过挖矿致富的小伙伴可以洗洗睡了。真正专业的矿场多数都建在水电站的旁边，低成本的获得能源，并且会对软硬件进行优化，关于挖矿的更多细节，[可以参考这篇文章](http://www.jpm.cn/article-2296-1.html)。\n\n回到我们的问题，比特币是如何流行的？答案是，不同时期挖矿的效率是不同的，在早期参与挖矿的机器少，竞争也比较少，更容易挖出比特币，当然这个时候比特币并不值钱，早期参与挖矿的也都是一些极客，他们通常都有这样的预期：比特币在未来将会更流行。\n\n**流通本身会带来价值**，在我们开头黄金的例子中，其实我们把黄金藏起来并不影响人们使用电子黄金进行交易，也就是说大家看重的不是黄金的价值，而是其作为价值载体的流通价值。从经济学的角度说，挖矿的供给是相对稳定的，更广泛的流通意味着有更多的人和场景需要比特币，而需求的增加将推升比特币价格。\n\n也就是说，如果你认为比特币会更流行，比特币的价格就存在上涨的预期，于是就会有更多的人参与挖矿，也会有人参与投机，总之会有越来越多的人参与进来，这一过程又促进了比特币价格上涨，形成一个正反馈的循环，比特币的早期参与者也因此获益。\n\n当然真实情况要复杂的多，另外一个重要的因素是，需要不断有人开拓比特币支付的场景，让更多的商家接受比特币支付，这样才能真正促进比特币作为货币的流通，不过其实问题的关键，还是让更多的人了解和接受比特币和数字货币的概念。\n\n## 没有支付宝，数字货币如何被记录？\n\n这里我们需要来解释一下区块链和比特币的关系，上面讲到，比特币挖矿是一个比拼算数学题的过程，在系统的设计中，每当比特币被挖到的时候，同时会产生一个叫做区块的东西，每个区块会记录从上一个区块产生到目前的所有比特币交易。\n\n除此之外，每个区块还有一个头部和尾部，其功能是通过密码学的原理，把相邻的区块连接起来，形成区块链，实现的效果是，如果某个区块的内容被篡改，就会与其相邻的区块产生冲突，进而被发现。\n\n区块链的设计机制是只有最长的链是有效的，假设有一个坏节点希望篡改区块链的内容，它无法改变某个单独的区块，只能争取产生新的假区块，这就需要和全网所有其他节点对抗，所以如果这个节点拥有超过全网50%的运算能力，就能实现对区块链进行控制，专业术语叫做算力攻击。\n\n目前比特币系统已经遍布全球，很难对其进行算力攻击，即使真的有人能做到，付出的成本也大于获得的价值，这就从经济学的角度杜绝了算力攻击。随着比特币网络越来越大，其价值会越来越高，但相应其算力也会越来越高，从而维持了这一平衡。\n\n**事实上区块链是一套去中心化的记账系统**。一般对于记账系统来说，记账行为和数据存储都是中心化的，去中心化记账相当于把账本分别存储在不同的地方，同时又由不同的人来记账，于是如何解决记账一致性的问题就是关键所在。\n\n区块链技术的特别之处，就在于通过竞争记账（算数学题）的方式，巧妙的解决了这一问题。当一个节点算出了数学题，可以迅速的向其他节点进行验证，当足够多的节点承认了这一结果后，系统就会进行确认，这就既避免了需要一个中心化的权威机构来做判断，又防止了恶意节点的操纵。\n\n## 区块链将如何改变世界？\n\n现在终于可以回答我们题目的问题，区块链将如何改变世界？读到这你有没有发现，如果我们接受了基于区块链的数字货币，其实我们就不需要银行了？事实上你也不会听说任何比特币银行。\n\n区块链对银行的替代作用和支付宝对银行的替代作用有相似的地方，我们把钱存在银行，无非出于3个原因：利息、安全、更方便的支付，这些功能支付宝都具备，而区块链具备后两者，不过财富管理带来的收益可以替代利息收益。\n\n无论是支付宝还是银行，都是中心化的记账系统，当我们使用非现金的方式付账的时候，需要有一个权威的记账机构，向商家证明我们的账户里真的有钱，并且帮我们把钱转付给商家。银行作为记账机构的权威性来自国家监管的背书，而我们相信支付宝是因为阿里巴巴的信用和技术能力。\n\n但是这样一个记账中介的存在产生了巨大的成本，想一想银行有多少线下网点，有多少服务人员吧。此外，每个银行都会有自己的 IT 记账系统，用户在支付和转账的时候，就会在银行间形成交易，分别被两个银行记录，这就涉及到对账和结算的问题。\n\n国内的交易还好说，因为有央行作为权威机构，在银行间进行清算，但是国际交易因为没有权威机构作为中介，各国的清算系统和流程又有很大差异，导致交易变得十分麻烦。\n\n区块链的解决方式是去中心化的，所有的交易都被公开的记录在区块链上，这就省去了对账的麻烦，跨国的交易也不需要等到当天银行结算后完成，而是可以实时到账。目前国际清算每笔的成本约26美元，如果区块链得以应用，仅此一项每年节约的费用就在数十甚至上百亿美元。\n\n更进一步来说，整个金融体系就是一个信任体系，原本这一体系是通过国家背书、金融监管的方式建立信任，**而区块链的出现，是用技术的手段解决了信任问题，从而对现有的金融系统提出了一套成本更低的替代解决方案**。\n\n再举一个例子，我们在交易所交易股票需要支付手续费，以覆盖交易所和证券体系运行的成本。但是如果区块链可以记录所有的股票交易，理论上我们也不再需要交易所了。按照A股每天2000亿交易额，平均交易成本万分之五计算，仅仅中国的股票交易，每天将节约成本1亿元。\n\n当一个行业成本结构发生变化的时候，往往会出现剧烈的变革，从这个角度来说，区块链将会重塑金融行业。全球金融行业每年的产值在数万亿美元，任何一个细分领域的应用，都将是一个庞大的市场。\n\n不仅如此，区块链创造的可信任的记账体系还有很多其他应用，例如记录影视、音乐、出版等行业的版权和交易；记录数字资产的发行；记录病史和就医情况，方便医生了解病人情况；记录供应链各个环节的生产，从而实现供应链的溯源，防止假货的产生等等。\n\n区块链向我们展示了一个所有资产都将被数字化的世界，在一个价值的互联网上，资产的转移将像今天信息的传递一样快捷、方便、便宜。不知道写到这里，你是不是还认为我在描述一个未来世界？在这里借用威廉·吉布森的一句话来结尾：未来已来，只是尚未流行。", "timestamp": 1653373825, "digest": "mIiMTR98A6BAXkt9Z0JBmKciz9XTYrPThCrAo3g9RCA", "contributor": "0x91e41069F5300128bbdeed94659A3Fe28499FF1E"}

the centrepiece of a hip-hop electronic crossover who’s performed at Art Basel and SXSW.\n\n[https://twitter.com/angelbaby/status/1502424206406873088?s=20&t=fCiX4zQnH4d1QVKEHbrqAQ](https://twitter.com/angelbaby/status/1502424206406873088?s=20&t=fCiX4zQnH4d1QVKEHbrqAQ)\n\nWith a couple NFT releases under their belt, angelbaby has been [taking to Twitter](https://twitter.com/angelbaby/status/1522679962003640320?s=20&t=fCiX4zQnH4d1QVKEHbrqAQ) to share insights into the world being cultivated through the release of an upcoming EP.\n\n[https://twitter.com/wearehume/status/1528843899225411584?s=20&t=o7KrPc6jxoof9Ed86ya6SQ](https://twitter.com/wearehume/status/1528843899225411584?s=20&t=o7KrPc6jxoof9Ed86ya6SQ)\n\nAs a collective, Hume works with different avatar projects - in this case FLUF World - to create artist identities around an emerging NFT series.\n\nWe can expect fans to collect through a multitude of vehicles, enjoying airdrops and governance rights for being active members of the community.\n\n## RŌHKI\n\n[RŌHKI](https://twitter.com/rohki) is a duo from two eternal beings - IO and HACHI.\n\nThe pseudo-anonymous artist project recently premiered their debut single - [Desperado](https://www.rohki.xyz/portal/desperado).\n\n[https://twitter.com/rohki/status/1527104550556995584?s=20&t=HtXF9OvNTNOIllEg5uqG3Q](https://twitter.com/rohki/status/1527104550556995584?s=20&t=HtXF9OvNTNOIllEg5uqG3Q)\n\nAfter selling out their [Genesis Key](https://opensea.io/collection/rohki-genesis-key) just an hour after a stealth launch, collectors were able to access a limited pre-mint a day in advance of a public sale.\n\nThe playbook for RŌHKI looks like this:\n\n* Release a Mint Pass in the form of Genesis Keys\n* Grant holders priority access to mint each Episode\n* Collect all Episodes in Season One for a special reward\n\nUnlike other Music NFTs, RŌHKI has placed extra emphasis on the visual presentation, debuting each Episode with a 4k animated music video and three different rarity tiers to bat.\n\nThe public mint [sold out](https://opensea.io/collection/rohki-desperado) within an hour, granting collectors a pre-reveal vial.\n\n[https://twitter.com/rohki/status/1526255575960412160?s=20&t=o7KrPc6jxoof9Ed86ya6SQ](https://twitter.com/rohki/status/1526255575960412160?s=20&t=o7KrPc6jxoof9Ed86ya6SQ)\n\nA week later, the vials morphed with the debut of the music video - creating a rarity game around the different tiers (Immersive, Dynamic and Static) of the Episode.\n\nAs found on [rohki.xyz](https://www.rohki.xyz/) and a series of [Mirror posts](https://mirror.xyz/0x99895960B30A34F8431517c4f5B52A1f4b9854a3), each RŌHKI release is custom-tailored to match each experience.\n\nWhile the act is not native to any existing avatar project, the lore suggests that an entire world will be created around Season 1 and beyond.\n\n## Bored Brothers\n\nThe star-studded side project of Kygo and Ryan Tedder took to Sound.xyz this month with the release of a debut single [“DRIP”](https://www.sound.xyz/boredbrothers/drip).\n\nWith Kygo boasting 30 million monthly listeners on Spotify, his pairing with Ryan Tedder - the lead singer of OneRepublic and debatably the [greatest songwriter of all-time](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/10-great-songs-you-didnt-know-onerepublics-ryan-tedder-wrote-250513/) - makes for a smash duo unlike anything web3 has seen before.\n\nThe [Bored Brothers](https://twitter.com/boredbrothers_) featured both platinum-selling artists pairing up their Bored Apes to release music under a new alias native to web3.\n\n[https://twitter.com/boredbrothers_/status/1517613226225127424?s=20&t=fCiX4zQnH4d1QVKEHbrqAQ](https://twitter.com/boredbrothers_/status/1517613226225127424?s=20&t=fCiX4zQnH4d1QVKEHbrqAQ)\n\nWith a pre-sale page made exclusive to BAYC holders, the Bored Brothers created an outlet for two artists who are normally subject to major label restrictions to experiment in the world of web3 with full autonomy.\n\nRyan Tedder teased a feature from a well-known rapper in their upcoming music video - another character who’s IRL tattoo is expected to make their web3 music debut through the next Bored Brothers release.\n\nMetastars created an outlet for two major artists to explor eweb3, and in the process, test the waters for what a community-owned project could look like when built from scratch.\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nWe’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg with Music NFTs.\n\n[https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/8OrpDmu5wboGX36-vXIt3gBMQMoihY0k_kV4XowlMMo](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/8OrpDmu5wboGX36-vXIt3gBMQMoihY0k_kV4XowlMMo)\n\nMetastars are gearing up to release their first full projects - all of which are set to debut with Music NFTs as the way the song(s) premier.\n\nExpect this summer to be full of Music NFT debuts.  \n  \n These are the first of many ways to get involved.

{"id": "ZwfqpKZ15G3PwD5pRJBtmX_IJ0qkTqSaOoCL4o0y7JQ", "title": "你了解区块链该读的第一篇文章：区块链将如何改变世界？", "body": "想象一下：我们重新回到金本位的世界，然后把每个人拥有的黄金数量都记录在支付宝里，我们买东西和转账都通过这个黄金支付宝来完成，而实物黄金被我们藏在一个谁也找不到的地方。\n\n这就是数字货币试图为我们描述的世界，有一种不依赖国家主权的物品（这里是黄金）充当一般等价物，你会发现其实这个一般等价物是什么并不重要，历史上也出现过白银甚至贝壳充当一般等价物的情况，当然，它也可以是比特币，真正重要的是，这个一般等价物要被大家所接受。\n\n但是数字货币的世界还是有点不同，在数字货币的世界中，并不存在支付宝，而是存在一套系统，它不属于任何人或公司，由多数人共同维护和控制，可以免费的帮我们记录资产和交易，而且从来不会犯错，也无法被攻击。这个系统就是区块链。\n\n## 怎么可能有人接受比特币？\n\n问出这个问题，显然你还没有接受比特币，这并不奇怪，这个世界的大多数人都没有接受比特币，但是当然也有一部分人选择了接受比特币，例如微软公司就接受比特币支付。目前比特币总价值超过了100亿美元，单个比特币的价格在3800元人民币左右。\n\n比特币并不是一夜之间获得现在的接受程度的，事实上从比特币面世到现在经历了近8年的时间，在2010年的时候产生了第一笔比特币交易，当时一个人用一万个比特币买了一个披萨（现在看这可能是有史以来最贵的披萨），所以比特币有一个逐渐被接受的过程，因此正确的问题应该是，到底是什么促进了比特币被接受？\n\n显然世界上最初没有比特币，产生比特币的过程被称为挖矿，你可以把它想象成开采黄金。不过比特币的挖矿是一个比拼算数题的过程，系统会为所有正在挖矿的计算机出一道数学题，谁先做出了这道题，谁就获得了比特币。影响挖矿产出的因素主要是算力，算力越高的机器挖出比特币的概率就越大。\n\n和开采黄金一样，比特币的挖矿也有成本，需要消耗电力和磨损硬件，现在用普通计算机挖矿，消耗的资源大概是挖出比特币价值的十倍，所以想通过挖矿致富的小伙伴可以洗洗睡了。真正专业的矿场多数都建在水电站的旁边，低成本的获得能源，并且会对软硬件进行优化，关于挖矿的更多细节，[可以参考这篇文章](http://www.jpm.cn/article-2296-1.html)。\n\n回到我们的问题，比特币是如何流行的？答案是，不同时期挖矿的效率是不同的，在早期参与挖矿的机器少，竞争也比较少，更容易挖出比特币，当然这个时候比特币并不值钱，早期参与挖矿的也都是一些极客，他们通常都有这样的预期：比特币在未来将会更流行。\n\n**流通本身会带来价值**，在我们开头黄金的例子中，其实我们把黄金藏起来并不影响人们使用电子黄金进行交易，也就是说大家看重的不是黄金的价值，而是其作为价值载体的流通价值。从经济学的角度说，挖矿的供给是相对稳定的，更广泛的流通意味着有更多的人和场景需要比特币，而需求的增加将推升比特币价格。\n\n也就是说，如果你认为比特币会更流行，比特币的价格就存在上涨的预期，于是就会有更多的人参与挖矿，也会有人参与投机，总之会有越来越多的人参与进来，这一过程又促进了比特币价格上涨，形成一个正反馈的循环，比特币的早期参与者也因此获益。\n\n当然真实情况要复杂的多，另外一个重要的因素是，需要不断有人开拓比特币支付的场景，让更多的商家接受比特币支付，这样才能真正促进比特币作为货币的流通，不过其实问题的关键，还是让更多的人了解和接受比特币和数字货币的概念。\n\n## 没有支付宝，数字货币如何被记录？\n\n这里我们需要来解释一下区块链和比特币的关系，上面讲到，比特币挖矿是一个比拼算数学题的过程，在系统的设计中，每当比特币被挖到的时候，同时会产生一个叫做区块的东西，每个区块会记录从上一个区块产生到目前的所有比特币交易。\n\n除此之外，每个区块还有一个头部和尾部，其功能是通过密码学的原理，把相邻的区块连接起来，形成区块链，实现的效果是，如果某个区块的内容被篡改，就会与其相邻的区块产生冲突，进而被发现。\n\n区块链的设计机制是只有最长的链是有效的，假设有一个坏节点希望篡改区块链的内容，它无法改变某个单独的区块，只能争取产生新的假区块，这就需要和全网所有其他节点对抗，所以如果这个节点拥有超过全网50%的运算能力，就能实现对区块链进行控制，专业术语叫做算力攻击。\n\n目前比特币系统已经遍布全球，很难对其进行算力攻击，即使真的有人能做到，付出的成本也大于获得的价值，这就从经济学的角度杜绝了算力攻击。随着比特币网络越来越大，其价值会越来越高，但相应其算力也会越来越高，从而维持了这一平衡。\n\n**事实上区块链是一套去中心化的记账系统**。一般对于记账系统来说，记账行为和数据存储都是中心化的，去中心化记账相当于把账本分别存储在不同的地方，同时又由不同的人来记账，于是如何解决记账一致性的问题就是关键所在。\n\n区块链技术的特别之处，就在于通过竞争记账（算数学题）的方式，巧妙的解决了这一问题。当一个节点算出了数学题，可以迅速的向其他节点进行验证，当足够多的节点承认了这一结果后，系统就会进行确认，这就既避免了需要一个中心化的权威机构来做判断，又防止了恶意节点的操纵。\n\n## 区块链将如何改变世界？\n\n现在终于可以回答我们题目的问题，区块链将如何改变世界？读到这你有没有发现，如果我们接受了基于区块链的数字货币，其实我们就不需要银行了？事实上你也不会听说任何比特币银行。\n\n区块链对银行的替代作用和支付宝对银行的替代作用有相似的地方，我们把钱存在银行，无非出于3个原因：利息、安全、更方便的支付，这些功能支付宝都具备，而区块链具备后两者，不过财富管理带来的收益可以替代利息收益。\n\n无论是支付宝还是银行，都是中心化的记账系统，当我们使用非现金的方式付账的时候，需要有一个权威的记账机构，向商家证明我们的账户里真的有钱，并且帮我们把钱转付给商家。银行作为记账机构的权威性来自国家监管的背书，而我们相信支付宝是因为阿里巴巴的信用和技术能力。\n\n但是这样一个记账中介的存在产生了巨大的成本，想一想银行有多少线下网点，有多少服务人员吧。此外，每个银行都会有自己的 IT 记账系统，用户在支付和转账的时候，就会在银行间形成交易，分别被两个银行记录，这就涉及到对账和结算的问题。\n\n国内的交易还好说，因为有央行作为权威机构，在银行间进行清算，但是国际交易因为没有权威机构作为中介，各国的清算系统和流程又有很大差异，导致交易变得十分麻烦。\n\n区块链的解决方式是去中心化的，所有的交易都被公开的记录在区块链上，这就省去了对账的麻烦，跨国的交易也不需要等到当天银行结算后完成，而是可以实时到账。目前国际清算每笔的成本约26美元，如果区块链得以应用，仅此一项每年节约的费用就在数十甚至上百亿美元。\n\n更进一步来说，整个金融体系就是一个信任体系，原本这一体系是通过国家背书、金融监管的方式建立信任，**而区块链的出现，是用技术的手段解决了信任问题，从而对现有的金融系统提出了一套成本更低的替代解决方案**。\n\n再举一个例子，我们在交易所交易股票需要支付手续费，以覆盖交易所和证券体系运行的成本。但是如果区块链可以记录所有的股票交易，理论上我们也不再需要交易所了。按照A股每天2000亿交易额，平均交易成本万分之五计算，仅仅中国的股票交易，每天将节约成本1亿元。\n\n当一个行业成本结构发生变化的时候，往往会出现剧烈的变革，从这个角度来说，区块链将会重塑金融行业。全球金融行业每年的产值在数万亿美元，任何一个细分领域的应用，都将是一个庞大的市场。\n\n不仅如此，区块链创造的可信任的记账体系还有很多其他应用，例如记录影视、音乐、出版等行业的版权和交易；记录数字资产的发行；记录病史和就医情况，方便医生了解病人情况；记录供应链各个环节的生产，从而实现供应链的溯源，防止假货的产生等等。\n\n区块链向我们展示了一个所有资产都将被数字化的世界，在一个价值的互联网上，资产的转移将像今天信息的传递一样快捷、方便、便宜。不知道写到这里，你是不是还认为我在描述一个未来世界？在这里借用威廉·吉布森的一句话来结尾：未来已来，只是尚未流行。", "timestamp": 1653373798, "digest": "mIiMTR98A6BAXkt9Z0JBmKciz9XTYrPThCrAo3g9RCA", "contributor": "0x91e41069F5300128bbdeed94659A3Fe28499FF1E"}

{"id": "_p_smnjngOB0GgOWPk4pUQ57UX5FYgoEg4LTY4T2IJo", "title": "区块链的工作原理及其可能对世界带来的影响", "body": "我们经常听到区块链这个概念，但是很少有人知道它到底是什么，它的工作原理，以及它能造成什么影响。纽约大学Stern商学院的David Yermack发表于Review of Finance的论文《[公司治理与区块链](https://academic.oup.com/rof/article/doi/10.1093/rof/rfw074/2888422/Corporate-Governance-and-Blockchains)》，是一篇很到位的科普文，它从非技术性角度清晰地回答了上述问题。以下只是不完整的概述，我强烈推荐各位阅读完整的论文。\n\n**区块链是什么？**\n\n一个区块链是一个信息的数据库，用来储存不经任何篡改的交易记录。这些记录可能包括了资产（股票、债券、房地产、汽车、艺术品）的所有权、出生证明、驾照，以及已投的选票。区块链最为人知的功能是储存了比特币的所有权记录，但是它的潜在应用范围远比这要广泛。和目前的记录储存方式相比，区块链有三个主要优势：\n\n* 成本。交易记录可以被自动更新，节省了诸如投票计票，或者请律师变更土地所有权一类的开支。\n* 迅速。交易记录几乎可以做到实时更新。相反，一个公司的账户也许每年只更新一次，并且投票的统计也需要时间。\n* 数据完整性。土地信息可能被篡改，公司损益表可以被操纵，期权可以回溯，但区块链中的数据却没有人能够更改。\n\n**区块链的工作原理**\n\n一个区块就是记录的一个集合。比如，一个比特币区块包含了在10分钟内（上图中的Merkle根（或Tx_Root））发生的所有比特币交易；每笔交易的记录包含时间、发送者、接收者，以及该笔交易的比特币数量。时间戳记录该区块的创建时间。\n\n一个区块链由一系列的区块构成，这些区块被一个哈希函数（散列函数）连接起来。哈希函数是一种将数据转换成一个十六进制编码的密码学，这些编码不能倒回去重现原始输入值。区块12的头部包含有反映区块11内容的哈希函数，区块11的头部又有反映区块10的内容的哈希函数，以此类推。这样一来，要在前面的一个区块上造假就是不可能的，因为这将会导致之后的所有区块的哈希值都发生变化，因此这种造假就很会容易被察觉。若有人想要篡改历史交易，那么他/她就不得不为后续所有的区块重新找到有效的哈希值。\n\n市场中任何一个参与者都可以更新一个公开区块链的信息——没有中心化的权威机构（不同于有土地注册处在管理土地所有权）。要创建区块13，一个参与者必须将新一笔交易的数据（并没有被包含在之前的任何区块里）和区块12的哈希值、时间戳，以及一个随机数拼接在一起。一个随机数就是和区块中的其他信息结合在一起能够生成一个新哈希值的随机数字。有效的哈希值必须在某个范围内，比如，必须有几个零开头。一个参与者需要不断试错，通过找到一个满足要求的随机数来生成区块13对应的哈希值。一旦有一个参与者率先成功了，其他成员会检验并承认区块13已经完成，然后去计算区块14。\n\n这个胜出的参与者会得到12.5个比特币的奖励（在比特币区块链里）；因此，这些有可能获得奖励的参与者就是我们所称的矿工。这个奖励鼓励矿工将新交易拼接起来并建立新的区块——这其实就是记账服务费。矿工选择他们想要包含在新区块里的任何交易，并对其进行编码；一般不会有两个矿工选中一模一样的交易组合。想要迅速获得交易证明的代理人，可以自愿付给将其交易成功编入下个区块的矿工一笔费用（作为激励）。\n\n这篇论文也介绍了私有和许可区块链。在两种区块链里，记录的更新是由一方或一个小组（由多方组成）来完成的。对这些区块链的监管本身又是另一个很有意思的议题，那篇论文同样也有提到。\n\n**区块链会如何影响现实世界？**\n\n最有意思的是这篇论文关于区块链潜在的变革性影响力的讨论。\n\n* 所有权透明度增加。交易记录将会即刻对每个人可见。目前，在美国，机构投资者头寸的13F报告每季度只发布一次。此外，公司有三种不同的股东名单（公司、交易所、代理投票）；公司往往并不知道他们真正的股东是谁。\n  * 透明度可以让投资者很难做到获得一个区块而不改变股价，这样就会加重Grossman和Hart在1980年提出的搭便车问题（Kyle and Vila (1991)）。\n\n\n  * 透明度能够阻止内部交易，并且相反会鼓励外界获得信息（Fishman and Hagerty (1992), Bushman, Piotoski, and Smith (2005)）。它同样会使期权奖励或者其他任何金融交易回溯的情况变为不可能。（Fishman and Hagerty (1992), Bushman, Piotoski, and Smith (2005)）\n* 更强的流动性。执行和完成股票交易可以更加迅速实惠。在美国，目前的结算往往需要3天时间并有多方介入才能完成。\n  * 流动性可以加强股东通过行使发言权（请见Maug (1998) 和Kahn and Winton (1998)的模型，及Norli, Ostergaard, and Schindele (2015)提出的证据）和退出投资（请见Admati and Pfleiderer (2009) 和 Edmans (2009)的模型，及Edmans, Fang, and Zur (2013)，还有Roosenboom, Schlingemann, and Vasconcelos (2014)提出的证据）实现的公司治理。\n\n\n  * 不仅是活跃的股东，普通人也可以从中受益。目前，从苏黎世汇款到纽约手续费是7%并且需要花3天时间。\n* 投票。区块链可以用来记录公司选举的投票。这将会提高选举准确性，并且化解关于管理层通过幕后操纵赢得绝大多数投票结果非常接近的选举的顾虑。由于股票的借贷将会变得透明，区块链同时也会让空洞投票（模型搭建于Brav and Mathews (2011), 实证研究于Hu and Black (2006) 和Christoffersen, Geczy, Musto, and Reed (2007)）变得更难。\n* 实时记账。一个公司可以在区块链上发布其所有的商业交易，让任何人在任何时候都可以合计出他们的损益表和资产负债表。这可以大大地减少对审计员的需求、防止应计盈余管理、阻止关联方交易。\n* 智能合约。智能合约是一种自动执行合约的方式：比如，如果借款人车贷违约，那么无人驾驶汽车可以自己开回银行。区块链可以很低廉地执行智能合约，比如一违约就改变抵押物的所有权。这从根本上减少了强制执行的成本。金融学教授们以后可能就再也没法写关于扣押抵押品的难点的论文了！\n\n**这只是一个白日梦吗？**\n\n许多革命性的科技都只是昙花一现，但有的却真的带来了变革性的影响。区块链会不负众望吗？2016年的三个比较突出的活动表明了它也许可以。\n\n* 澳大利亚证券交易所公布了一项计划，该计划准备使用区块链技术来重新设计其清算和结算系统，其他许多主要证券市场也开展了探索性的项目。\n* 纳斯达克证券交易所公布了一个在股东会议上利用区块链平台进行投票的试点计划。管理几乎所有美国大选计票工作的私企Broadridge开始下大力气做相关研究，准备在美国公司选举投票中使用区块链。\n\n美国上市公司Overstock.com于2016年11月在一个区块链上发行了股票，这样他们虽然在监管机构处注册了股份，但并没有经过传统的证券交易所。", "timestamp": 1653373974, "digest": "Yt7-Sk0HanUf_G7xB2PGu8b3XeboHg4wQr0X7rFE51A", "contributor": "0x91e41069F5300128bbdeed94659A3Fe28499FF1E"}

{"id": "0qrhvQxONAZjkJ-zhwqwmqVGlv2QyFCSDi4fAMg5wKo", "title": "How To Mint an Entry on Mirror", "body": "## gm 🐰\n\nWhen you think about NFTs, written articles aren’t the first thing that come to mind. But **Mirror** is quickly changing that. In this guide, we’re going to dive into **[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)** - **a web3 toolkit for sharing stories, funding ideas, and turning text-based content into NFTs** - **and mint an entry of our own!**\n\n## What Do I Need?\n\nBefore we begin, let’s make sure you have your gear in order. To mint an entry on Mirror, you will need:\n\n* An Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask or Rainbow\n* Some ETH in your wallet to mint your article as an NFT. It is free to publish an article on Mirror, but minting it as an NFT will require gas fees.\n\n*If you need help getting set up, head over to our **[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCECH_RfQJOShGkYIVEXAX7w).** There, you’ll find guides for **[setting up your wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VghMd-I_-I&t=1s)** and **[purchasing some ETH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqlmAXtWSCE)!***\n\n## NFTs & Mirror\n\nWhile today’s most popular NFTs are image-based, pictures are just a fraction of what NFTs are capable of. At their core, **NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are simply proofs of ownership written on a blockchain**. These proofs of ownership represent an asset, digital or physical, and link it to an individual's blockchain address. The result is a publicly verifiable file, showing a certain thing owned by a certain person.\n\nSo, can an article be an NFT? Absolutely!\n\nAt first glance, **Mirror** may just look like a web3 platform for publishing and monetizing articles — something like a blockchain-based Medium or Substack. But under the hood, Mirror is a powerful tool for creating content and building communities. It gives you everything you need for minting NFTs, crowdfunding, splitting proceeds from sales, and even minting ERC20 tokens to distribute to new community members.\n\n**Today, we’re going to write our first Mirror entries and mint them as NFTs. Let’s go!**\n\n## The Guide\n\n### Step 1\n\nFirst, head to **[mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/)** and **connect your wallet** with the button in the top-right corner.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JYg4ABTPHcDHoMwwxLkBQ.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 2\n\nIf this is your first time using Mirror, **go to the Settings tab** in the left toolbar to set your profile picture, bio, color theme, and display name.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uJXszMCnMGYiKzUigVdCy.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 3\n\nOnce you're happy with your profile settings, go back to the **Entries** tab and **click *Create Your First Entry***.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_z0E8xpQ5lTY-jOrSjiLE.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 4\n\nNow on the Write page, you’ll have access to Mirror’s text editor. This includes all of the writing platform essentials - headings, bulleted lists, images, and blockquotes. **Go ahead and write your article!** If you’re stumped and looking for inspiration, hop into the **[RabbitHole community Discord](https://discord.gg/G9XbdKfWgz)** for ideas to get your started!\n\nYou will also have access to a number of web3 tools for monetizing your work and incorporating other NFTs. These include Crowdfund, Edition, Auction, Split, and NFT Preview. We won’t be using these for our first entry, but you can learn more about them **[here](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide)**!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WjnsZIsSjd-Kxn1jlQt7M.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 5\n\nAfter you have written your article, **click the gear in the top-right corner** to bring up your article settings. Upload a **header image** (3000x1500 px) and enter a **meta title** and **entry excerpt**. Your header image will also represent your entry NFT when it is minted.\n\nOnce you're done, check your meta preview at the bottom of the article settings. This will show you how your article will appear on Mirror, search engines, and social media platforms. This is also a good time to **save your article as a draft** if you haven’t done so already. Just **click *Save Draft*** at the top.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ECl-b_LxwdcbF2lLeOQvd.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 6\n\nNow that you have a written article, a header image, and your meta settings all filled out, it’s time to **give everything a good double-check**. Once your article is minted as an NFT, you will not be able to make any edits or updates to it.\n\nAs with any NFT you mint, **this article will forever be associated with your wallet!** Even if you sell it, your wallet address will be shown as the original creator. So be sure to mint an original, quality article that you are happy to be associated with.\n\n### Step 7\n\nIf everything looks good to go, it’s time to publish and mint! **Click *Publish*** and **check the *Mint as NFT Edition* box**. A final menu will appear. If you haven’t added a header image yet you can do so here.\n\n**This menu will also contain the very important Funds recipient box.** This is the wallet address that funds will be sent to when your NFT sells. Copy your wallet address by clicking it and then paste it into this box.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bsm39UDQKOIjZXZfcXulN.png?height=990&width=1710)\n\n### Step 8\n\nGive everything one final review and, when you’re ready, **click *Publish And Mint Entry***. You will be minting this as an NFT on the blockchain, so you will need to pay a gas fee. **Confirm this transaction in your wallet** and pay the gas fee to mint your entry!\n\n## Congratulations!\n\nAnd that’s it! This transaction will take a few minutes to confirm, but once it has, **you’ll have officially minted your Mirror entry as an NFT!**\n\nMinting on Mirror is just one part of our NFT journey this season.

But **Mirror** is quickly changing that. In this guide, we’re going to dive into **[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)** - **a web3 toolkit for sharing stories, funding ideas, and turning text-based content into NFTs** - **and mint an entry of our own!**\n\n## What Do I Need?\n\nBefore we begin, let’s make sure you have your gear in order. To mint an entry on Mirror, you will need:\n\n* An Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask or Rainbow\n* Some ETH in your wallet to mint your article as an NFT. It is free to publish an article on Mirror, but minting it as an NFT will require gas fees.\n\n*If you need help getting set up, head over to our **[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCECH_RfQJOShGkYIVEXAX7w).** There, you’ll find guides for **[setting up your wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VghMd-I_-I&t=1s)** and **[purchasing some ETH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqlmAXtWSCE)!***\n\n## NFTs & Mirror\n\nWhile today’s most popular NFTs are image-based, pictures are just a fraction of what NFTs are capable of. At their core, **NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are simply proofs of ownership written on a blockchain**. These proofs of ownership represent an asset, digital or physical, and link it to an individual's blockchain address. The result is a publicly verifiable file, showing a certain thing owned by a certain person.\n\nSo, can an article be an NFT? Absolutely!\n\nAt first glance, **Mirror** may just look like a web3 platform for publishing and monetizing articles — something like a blockchain-based Medium or Substack. But under the hood, Mirror is a powerful tool for creating content and building communities. It gives you everything you need for minting NFTs, crowdfunding, splitting proceeds from sales, and even minting ERC20 tokens to distribute to new community members.\n\n**Today, we’re going to write our first Mirror entries and mint them as NFTs. Let’s go!**\n\n## The Guide\n\n### Step 1\n\nFirst, head to **[mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/)** and **connect your wallet** with the button in the top-right corner.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JYg4ABTPHcDHoMwwxLkBQ.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 2\n\nIf this is your first time using Mirror, **go to the Settings tab** in the left toolbar to set your profile picture, bio, color theme, and display name.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uJXszMCnMGYiKzUigVdCy.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 3\n\nOnce you're happy with your profile settings, go back to the **Entries** tab and **click *Create Your First Entry***.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_z0E8xpQ5lTY-jOrSjiLE.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 4\n\nNow on the Write page, you’ll have access to Mirror’s text editor. This includes all of the writing platform essentials - headings, bulleted lists, images, and blockquotes. **Go ahead and write your article!** If you’re stumped and looking for inspiration, hop into the **[RabbitHole community Discord](https://discord.gg/G9XbdKfWgz)** for ideas to get your started!\n\nYou will also have access to a number of web3 tools for monetizing your work and incorporating other NFTs. These include Crowdfund, Edition, Auction, Split, and NFT Preview. We won’t be using these for our first entry, but you can learn more about them **[here](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide)**!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WjnsZIsSjd-Kxn1jlQt7M.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 5\n\nAfter you have written your article, **click the gear in the top-right corner** to bring up your article settings. Upload a **header image** (3000x1500 px) and enter a **meta title** and **entry excerpt**. Your header image will also represent your entry NFT when it is minted.\n\nOnce you're done, check your meta preview at the bottom of the article settings. This will show you how your article will appear on Mirror, search engines, and social media platforms. This is also a good time to **save your article as a draft** if you haven’t done so already. Just **click *Save Draft*** at the top.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ECl-b_LxwdcbF2lLeOQvd.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 6\n\nNow that you have a written article, a header image, and your meta settings all filled out, it’s time to **give everything a good double-check**. Once your article is minted as an NFT, you will not be able to make any edits or updates to it.\n\nAs with any NFT you mint, **this article will forever be associated with your wallet!** Even if you sell it, your wallet address will be shown as the original creator. So be sure to mint an original, quality article that you are happy to be associated with.\n\n### Step 7\n\nIf everything looks good to go, it’s time to publish and mint! **Click *Publish*** and **check the *Mint as NFT Edition* box**. A final menu will appear. If you haven’t added a header image yet you can do so here.\n\n**This menu will also contain the very important Funds recipient box.** This is the wallet address that funds will be sent to when your NFT sells. Copy your wallet address by clicking it and then paste it into this box.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bsm39UDQKOIjZXZfcXulN.png?height=990&width=1710)\n\n### Step 8\n\nGive everything one final review and, when you’re ready, **click *Publish And Mint Entry***. You will be minting this as an NFT on the blockchain, so you will need to pay a gas fee. **Confirm this transaction in your wallet** and pay the gas fee to mint your entry!\n\n## Congratulations!\n\nAnd that’s it! This transaction will take a few minutes to confirm, but once it has, **you’ll have officially minted your Mirror entry as an NFT!**\n\nMinting on Mirror is just one part of our NFT journey this season.

Doodles，成为有史以来Opensea交易量第八的NFT项目和月销量排行的No.1（截止2022年2月17日），坐稳新晋蓝筹。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6tOQs0_aoOqxzR-xg5w_E.png?height=1045&width=1606)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9fjQCXDrYr5YTV6fU9rqA.png?height=1044&width=1604)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Fd7_ynJQseJ7hY5AypbR.png?height=812&width=1009)\n\n初触Azuki，进入discord社群仅有500多人，频道简洁、Alpha推介理由中只有一句——**“守望先锋艺术家”**。\n\n这一Title正好契合“中文NFT玩家不少游戏、电竞关注者”的事实，在最初给红豆带来了一波天然的流量（同理最近开启日式少女漫画风的项目“KillerGF”，也因为艺术家给英雄联盟创作了阿狸和KDA角色受到关注）。\n\n**Azuki的成功，并不仅仅因为艺术家。**\n\n反观所有目前的蓝筹NFT，艺术领域中最重要的“原创美感”是必不可少的因素。而NFT作为非同质化代币，如何能够**兼顾“社群身份的视觉共识”和“与众不同的专属印记”**？\n\n这个“同而不同”的艺术目标就成了新项目需要斟酌的问题——玩家想要创作获得项目方喜爱的Fan-art中也一样。\n\n不得不提到**0N1**——Azuki存在于大热又沉寂，同时也带火了白名单玩法的项目0N1之后，同属于侧面半身漫画类PFP，不得不承认它有着一些以0N1为灵感的影子，与它几乎同期的0N1类项目“0xVampire”已经趋近归零，但走到今天，Azuki已经完全以“侧身头像”为源，**开创了独属自己的红豆之路**——\n\n品牌化运作方式、蓝筹中稀缺的亚洲文化、中外受众广泛的日漫画风、设计技术细节兼备的网页设计、不止于虚拟世界的后续文创、路书与合约有迹可循的“$BEAN”代币计划、开创行业新规的合约技术、项目方倡导的“Trust the process”理念，以及上述所有综合吸引而形成的良好社区氛围……\n\n## 逐渐登场的亚洲力量\n\n红豆公售前迅速面世的亚洲项目“Phantabear”已经让NFT世界了解到“中文玩家NFT消费力”，短短2个月，不同ALPHA社区推介内容中“该社区中文玩家较为多”这一评价已从De-buff，变成了中立考量甚至加分项。\n\n无论是机遇还是必然，承载着NFT交易市场重要占比的中文玩家，此时需要一个贴近原生文化、符合个人审美的PFP NFT。\n\n在此之前的“蓝筹”少有明确的亚洲文化属性，一些出现在无聊猿中的日式配件甚至被指摘带有负面指向；而红豆的视觉设计避开了文化冲突，从人物五官到服饰风格，采用接受度广泛的日式动漫画风。\n\n## 审美较高的画风、故事感和延展度俱佳的设定\n\nAzuki的角色设定中有四种不同的“物种”：人类、蓝色、红色、精神；9类“魔法”特征（非官方命名）：闪电、水、地球、火灾、樱花、烟雾、狐火、蝴蝶、萤火虫……\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hS0ruIVoFpX4Ruey7TYQS.jpg?height=1796&width=2882)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wZ7DHFXRN0MjjeLhnfxFq.jpg?height=1794&width=2874)\n\n我们很容易联想到火影、钢炼、鬼灭等知名动漫，任意元素代入这些故事当中都能与之世界观完美融合，并在红豆官方出品的剧集面世之前，给粉丝打开了广阔的想象空间。\n\nNFT世界和潮玩手办中必备的稀有属性，红豆也巧妙拿捏——**金豆子**成为幸运玩家和鲸鱼玩家在眼缘扫货之余的囤货首选。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eG98a3fkdMF4b7XcmIzXx.png?height=1117&width=1856)\n\n丰富、有趣的配饰——副手中的法术、武器、旗帜、音箱，配件中的耳机、发饰，不同的帽衫、和服……配饰创作与角色设定结合，猜测这些元素并非完全的随机组合，而是精心创作后的有机选择，每一张JPG似乎因此有了**全新生命和专属故事感**——\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l3fNiMjrw7NSZJW-9wX30.png?height=1173&width=1268)\n\n无论抽到高排名的玩家、还是开到地板的非酋，都能持有自己豆子，“进入红豆宇宙”。\n\n这甚至给了社区成员**进行二创的基底**，我们浏览社区和推特，或许已经见过这些以自己豆子为原型或官方稀有角色为剧情中心创作的“同人作品”（红豆前的大割项目阿尼也有很多写给自己藏品的故事，大多来自中文玩家）。\n\n![Dis频道里有不少优秀的二创](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-Xxl9T0RCR7lX7n9etv9t.png?height=396&width=758)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CRXTQJfZHsA2VulZ2cuwv.png?height=783&width=540)\n\nfan-art原创音乐：<https://twitter.com/azukimv3/status/1493879647431397376?s=21>\n\n一张**小图片因此复活**，不再仅仅只是知名合集中万分之一的组件——Azuki成功圈住第一波颜粉。\n\n## 被重视的艺术版块——不仅仅是乙方\n\n红豆的艺术家**不仅仅是“接受委托的乙方”**，这意味着创作者拥有**足够的话语权和自主性**，更愿意在打磨作品上花费时间。\n\n因守望先锋受到关注的**Arnold Tsang**目前已经**全职于Azuki**，作为5名创世团队中唯一实名露面的一员，这对项目方和粉丝来说或许都很重要——平等共事，能够避免一些甲乙双方的永恒存在的矛盾，至少目前我们也不太担心红豆的后续艺术产出会有落差；而有人愿意站到台前，一般都比匿名项目方更加可信。\n\n## 视觉、音乐、网站——高度统一的红豆审美\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5DP_s3O9AR492bnenwlb6.jpg?height=989&width=2060)\n\n官方释出的其他类型作品，都展现了高度统一、风格明确、制作精良的红豆美学——几个官方视频也显示出**成熟的视频/音乐制作水准**。\n\n[https://twitter.com/AzukiZen/status/1468641733210566658?s=20&t=JJCObrPPCETiSFWUWVxKIQ](https://twitter.com/AzukiZen/status/1468641733210566658?s=20&t=JJCObrPPCETiSFWUWVxKIQ)\n\n与其他项目的官网没有太多次级页面不同，Azuki的[官方网站](https://www.azuki.com/)不仅仅是mint的入口，也是**品牌集成中心**——除了常规功能外，我们能清楚了解到项目规划与进程，也能够根据特征检索NFT、验证Holder身份后绑定discord ID……\n\n![集成于官网中的Holder验证界面，成功后还有礼花效果ε(\\*･ω･)_/ﾟ:･☆](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_lgFkR_5xbNkVpVxM6Noq.jpg?height=1288&width=2039)\n\n![类似于交易市场的检索功能](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8o0vMrOMvCwitv4J3ch8Z.png?height=868&width=1840)\n\n## 创始团队——无法忽视的框架搭建者\n\nAzuki当然要往Web3走去，做“去中心化”品牌，但**去中心化是真的不需要Leader吗**？\n\n“DAO的本质上需要优秀的领导者搭建出框架，吸引优秀的成员填充出最终的样子”——搭建框架的人，非常重要。我们从一些细节看到团队做决策的考量——\n\n· Azuki启动之前团队在其他ALpha社区观察成员对Whitelist的讨论，并确定运营逻辑\n\n· 不在参与推文的人中抽白虽然能迅速传播项目，因为不是“坚实的受众”\n\n· 不公开所选中的核心用户推特，以防止骗局DM\n\n· 取消公售，最后17个名额以公平方式在社区分配\n\n· 集成验证holder功能到官网，不直接引用现成机器人\n\n……\n\n## 社群——以“核心文化”留住真正粉丝\n\n红豆社区从一开始就完全**摒弃了“邀请人数和提升等级”来虚张规模**——“真正参与其中”是获得白名单的唯一方式；**“培养真正的核心成员，让豆子缓慢发芽”**，这让社群成员有着较高共识。\n\n没有“邀请拿白制”，所以经历了较长的运营周期后，红豆的discord依旧处于**相对封闭**的状态。\n\n我们能够因此明白，纸面数字增长也许真的意义不大，聚拢有价值的真实玩家更重要。另一条——合理规则带来的自主筛选，而非用技术手段可破解的、用以营造稀缺感的限时开门，一定能够吸引到优质Holder。\n\n令人头疼的是现在很多项目依旧选择discord邀请限时/限量开放等办法，企图规避工作室，而不以相信能够凭借自身洞察与判断以选中优秀的社区成员——这反而很多时候阻拦了粉丝，场外交易已经不止售卖白名单，也开始打包售卖“进门”dis账号。\n\n发售不久前、令人惊叹的fan-art出圈后，豆子才被很多规模化的工作室注意到，此时他们已经少有进入其中的机会。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HzOxw_1ZkauKNodVFC0ds.png?height=498&width=541)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5_O9LrQlVrGqTruUECRhP.png?height=624&width=537)\n\n## 发售方式与开源合约——研磨者、革新者、分享者\n\n不用赘述红豆的合约有多出名——红豆dev改进后推出以极低gas、更快速度完成mint的合约，“革新但不私藏”的做法让它成为“以gas war反映项目热度”行业中的一股清流。\n\n（官方对gas的介绍推文：<https://twitter.com/AzukiZen/status/1479235139167207432?s=20&t=obcIDGbhUxUiTazYosRZzA>）\n\n**分享意味着分利？**\n\n红豆discord中创建了一个频道，以供dev在其中分享和答疑——我们也称之为格局，但“分享精神”是笔者在最初接触加密行业时最为感概的一点。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hyyLdKUeh3YKPYlh1S5Cu.png?height=214&width=1203)\n\n（加密世界很多黑客，但也有很多热心有爱的技术人员——共建社区时“为爱发电”，后续换来项目方的主动给予，“撸毛”行业源于此，也被卡bug于此）\n\n后续不少项目方感谢红豆带来行业革新——作为技术外行对此也非常感慨，它让小资金玩家能省下并不便宜的gas，提升Mint体验——很多前期热度不错、独具风格项目**因技术而被FUD**——白名单无限mint/白名单不能mint/无法承载攻击而发射延迟/前端崩溃合约提前……\n\n此外，红豆的发行逻辑也值得一提（不少其他项目方也采取了类似做法）——\n\n“荷兰拍 → 荷兰拍结束价格的一半进行白名单销售 → 剩余公售（最后17只取消了公售，进行社区内选择）”\n\n常规的“白名单先mint”方式，大概率有着“地板拉高，后续荷兰拍更容易以高价结束”的剧情，但是先进行荷兰拍的方式**更加考验玩家对项目预期和评判**，在没有任何稳定盈利参考的基础上，也能**筛选掉完全不care项目本身的套利者**。\n\n技术让人消落，也助人崛起，行事初衷决定它的走向。\n\n## 未来规划——品牌建设、文创周边、代币经济\n\n路书——告诉别人“卖光后，我们计划怎么办”。\n\n高盈利、高变化的市场，不少项目方mint结束便会另起炉灶开启新一轮收割，这也是很多玩家初评项目需要了解“roadmap”的重要原因，当然编造roadmap也是大割信手拈来的事儿。\n\n近日，Azuki 将碎片化Token#40 (Bobu) ，作为它去中心化治理的尝试，碎片持有人作为dao成员集体治理和决定Bobu IP的未来。\n\n![（官网介绍：https://www.azuki.com/bobu-101#bobu-101）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7krMlSrNIU4HlHmCZk4Sq.png?height=302&width=310)\n\n我们可以在官网中看到，红豆NFT的发行仅仅是它品牌化的第一步——元宇宙3D艺术部署（以鸟屋为特征等日式场景）、实体周边、剧情短片、代币经济或者游戏……\n\n‘Take it slow and stay focused on the long-game.’\n\n很多规划尚未面世，红豆缓步推进蓝图，我们也拭目以待。\n\n引用推特@_Kaspar__的话：\n\n• “到处都是骗局和低质量的项目”\n\n• “找到真正的质量和长期价值变得越来越难”\n\n• “就算你不喜欢红豆，也应该在这其中了解到不错的NFT是什么样子”\n\n## 男豆、女豆——玩家性别比例的真实反应\n\n粉丝愿意换为头像时，项目的地板和成交或许反映了什么——Azuki的男豆地板比女豆要高——当然**不少男性玩家因为某个女豆长得像现/前女友而求购**，但这也非常明确地告诉我们，NFT世界里女性玩家比男性少太多。\n\n与朋友的交流中发现，女性玩家在寻找潜力蓝筹上有着不太相同的取向和见解，但因为技术门槛或者一些环境因素，进入NFT世界女生还太少。自己喜欢的几个活跃的微信群，包括红豆官方中文社区，真实的女性玩家比例也不超过10％。\n\n我们讨论女权，炒作女性艺术家，但是带领女生了解这个领域的人到底多不多呢？\n\n另一点，女性玩家比较少，所以可能少有人提到“饭圈”——**NFT和饭圈非常相似**。\n\n· 项目方、项目本身是明星工作室和面临出道/已经当红的艺人；\n\n· 团队成员找到具有输出能力的核心粉丝成为粉头（MOD）；\n\n· 也有需要对接不同渠道（社区）的运营；\n\n· 少不了与其他艺人（项目合作）联动的CP营销；\n\n· Dis可以理解为超话，一切fan-art都是粉丝产出周边；\n\n· 优秀的fan-art或内推有机会成为后援会会员（Whitelist），获得提前购买官方产品的机会；\n\n· 吃瓜（FUD）过程中也需要带着自己的判断甄别黑料来源、散布者的目的；\n\n· 可以不喜欢但也无需拉踩别的流量，喜欢什么就在有共识的社区（dis、tele、微信群等）圈地自萌、强化信仰。\n\n一切在饭圈行得通的准则这里同样适用，所以必然**只有颜值和实力兼具的流量，才能在尘埃落定后不塌房、成为常青树。**\n\n有人全靠包装和炒作，就有人研磨业务水平；有人利用粉丝经济牟利，就有人因践行正向价值；有人因为Mint了新墙头，也有人觉得自己的朴素豆子香；有红豆这样多维度评价都不错的新星，就让人对一定会出现的下一个优质爱豆充满期待……\n\n## 最后，我们究竟喜欢什么呢？\n\n**我们喜欢被尊重的视觉艺术——**\n\n喜欢红豆中能找到的东方美学共鸣，喜欢画进图里的不敷衍和对持有者的尊重，喜欢1万个角色自带的生命力、故事感，喜欢一张图片带来的广阔想象空间……\n\n**我们喜欢统一而高标准的品牌化运作方式——**\n\n喜欢它从推特、dis到官网都有着正规军该有的样子，喜欢一切具有红豆审美的推广视频、原创音乐、活动策划，喜欢官网的视觉设计、精心架构和贴心而流畅的实用功能……\n\n**喜欢相对公平和平等的WL选择方式——**\n\n喜欢拒绝以cx和pua来制造热度、虚张规模，喜欢更看重创意和质量的选择；喜欢科学家和工作室难钻空子的规则设计，喜欢决策者以平等的姿态对待粉丝……\n\n**我们喜欢凝聚着创造力的平等社区——**\n\n喜欢友善而热情的交流，喜欢Holder和关注者们创作时的无目的，喜欢有趣有才的甚至比原图更棒的粉丝艺术，喜欢分享作品后收到的真诚鼓励和赞扬；\n\n**我们喜欢决心驶向广袤也踏实做事的项目方——**\n\n喜欢Azuki诞生之际就有着深远的考量，喜欢团队践行了他们“Trust the

Mt's will re-define your social relationship graph. Mt's image tells us that when we started to enter the crypto world, many people are the watchers, they were or surprised, or skeptical, or excited, or afraid. However, as an objective rule, the arrival of anything new alway create chaos, some won, some lost, some waited and waited.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0AmbCbCggDrMmh6nH_Zvh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n### Participation\n\nMt's are issued in 12600 pieces. Every Mt's has its unique characteristics and rarity. Mt's will help you realize your social value, allowing you to gain fun and income from your social connections and behavior. Mt's wants to flip the NFT market with new form of energy. NFT shall not be the chips in the hand of the rich, at least that’s not Mt’s. Mt’s owners help each other in a way that no one has ever done.\n\nMt's will issue the first 50 pieces as the seed, half of which will be given as Whitelist to those who have participated and contributed in Mt’s early stages, the other half goes to the first official mint pool where everyone can participate.\n\nTo obtain the first 50 Mt’s are required to go to Mt’s website, log into personal page for the Invitation Code(IC). ICs are the permission to participate mint. Make sure IC in the pocket prior to each mint round.\n\nMt's mint uses an incremental model with an initial price of 0.09 ETH.  Totally 6\\*round mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kiQWX7xPDP5Em54uLfSrV.png?height=1434&width=2794)\n\n## Beyond the PFPs, go ride with mtier!\n\n### Mtier Rank Program\n\nIn order to promote Mt’s influence and build solid relationship among members, Mt’s has its unique incentive program, the Mtier Rank Program(MRP). Once user own Mt’s NFT, he/she becomes a mtier Noob. After completing 2\\*invites and both invitees successful mint Mt’s, mtier Noob go to the rank, the MRP automatically kicks in.\n\nEach mtier has his/her rank(except the Noob), ranks come with different allowances. \n MRP reward is made of two parts: Share reward and Royalties. \n Share reward is an invitation-oriented incentive.\n\n**i.g.** \n Mtier1 invites 2\\*mtier2 and both mtier2 sucessfully mint Mt’s NFT, mtier1 will gain 24% share reward from mtier2’s mint costs.  If mtier2 has his/her own 2\\*mtier3 minted Mt’s NFT, mtier2 will gain 24% share reward from mtier3’s mint costs, meanwhile mtier1 gains 12%  share reward from mtier3’s mint costs.\n\nAlso mtiers will gain 10% of the royalties when their Mt’s NFT in Opensea, etc. \n The specific allowance rate chart shows as following:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5jLNtGnQ7MdFkIxiQH2xx.png?height=1645&width=3761)\n\n### Funds Allocation\n\n**All mint funds will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 50.87% will go to Mtier Rank Program.  \n 24.13% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 25% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**Royalty income will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 2.49% will be awarded to all users holding NFT and participating in the invitation. \n 3% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 4.45% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**The Mt’s Community Treasury:**  \n 20% of the Foundation's funds will be used for acquisitions and marketing. \n 80% will be reserved for bonuses.\n\n\\*When only 5% of total market Mt's NFT are remained, all bonuses will be shared equally.\n\n### Mt's DAO\n\nAll users holding Mt's NFT are members of Mt's DAO. Mt's DAO members can vote in project decisions and can decide how to use bonuses and whether to acquire new NFTs. Mt's DAO will in future be involved and influence the development of Mt's NFT as the core decision maker of Mt's NFT.\n\n### Reward collection\n\nThe mtier who have activated the rewards, can collect them on Mt’s official website. In order to better motivate new comer, Mt's NFT has been reorganized on the collection mechanism-all Mt's NFT that has collected rewards will be automatically destroyed. This deflation mechanism can increase the value of retained Mt 's NFT. After destruction, designated mtier will receive a new vMt's NFT as a credential to record your existing social network.\n\n### vMt's NFT Function\n\nvMt's NFT is a derivative NFT after the original Mt's NFT is destroyed. 20% of vMt's NFT will be used as the seed for the next project and the rest can be redeemed for future CON LAB new projects. Holding vMt's NFT will also continue to maintain your existing social connections, meaning you will continue to increase the value  your social connections. Further more, Holding vMt's NFT will also give you the opportunity to receive token airdrops.\n\n### Mt's redefines NFT\n\n\"The next era will be defined by today's social networking sites and the depth of connection given to users, and our job is to find the best way for users to share themselves\" - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nThe value of relationships is based on the sharing economy, which means sharing one's state of being, one's information, one's interests, one's hobbies. The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing. Mt’s aims to build a perpetual social-fi  generator in Web3.\n\nThe CON LAB will create a decentralized NFT trading platform driven by influencers and the community through a perpetual network of social connections, with the proceeds of each transaction distributed to the platform's NFT holders to enjoy perpetual dividends and a true return of equity to the user.\n\n## What is Mt's\n\n***The Made-it's , The Miss-it's, The My-turn's!***\n\nThis was a great movement that will eventually be remembered in crypto history. Free from the interference of capitals and authorities. There are no losers in this movement.\n\nThis time we are not a bystander, we are expressing our emotions in a way that will influence more crypto practitioners.\n\nFrom this moment on, Mt's will change the world.\n\n### Follow Mt’s\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MtsNFTs)    |    [Disocrd](https://discord.gg/TK3VCgH4pR)    |    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUahYxfJ2xaB9W9js3ifWQ)\n\n## Don't wait&see, up with Mt’s.", "timestamp": 1653374171, "digest": "vyA5575rvQ7kbqkumCcLLXqMptIBWzFhFzwE4MfQexc", "contributor": "0x5b23A5d907805a4dcFBe13aE232442A6746c5C9C"}

{"id": "uU-91NL5goQ_OEwXeZo46Mom-LiaclWuM5yEV-YGfEI", "title": "区块链的工作原理及其可能对世界带来的影响", "body": "我們經常聽到區塊鏈這個概念，但是很少有人知道它到底是什麼，它的工作原理，以及它能造成什麼影響。紐約大學Stern商學院的David Yermack發表於Review of Finance的論文《[公司治理與區塊鏈](https://academic.oup.com/rof/article/doi/10.1093/rof/rfw074/2888422/Corporate-Governance-and-Blockchains)》，是一篇很到位的科普文，它從非技術性角度清晰地回答了上述問題。以下只是不完整的概述，我強烈推薦各位閱讀完整的論文。\n\n**區塊鍊是什麼？**\n\n一個區塊鍊是一個信息的數據庫，用來儲存不經任何篡改的交易記錄。這些記錄可能包括了資產（股票、債券、房地產、汽車、藝術品）的所有權、出生證明、駕照，以及已投的選票。區塊鏈最為人知的功能是儲存了比特幣的所有權記錄，但是它的潛在應用範圍遠比這要廣泛。和目前的記錄儲存方式相比，區塊鏈有三個主要優勢：\n\n* 成本。交易記錄可以被自動更新，節省了諸如投票計票，或者請律師變更土地所有權一類的開支。\n* 迅速。交易記錄幾乎可以做到實時更新。相反，一個公司的賬戶也許每年只更新一次，並且投票的統計也需要時間。\n* 數據完整性。土地信息可能被篡改，公司損益表可以被操縱，期權可以回溯，但區塊鏈中的數據卻沒有人能夠更改。\n\n**區塊鏈的工作原理**\n\n一個區塊就是記錄的一個集合。比如，一個比特幣區塊包含了在10分鐘內（上圖中的Merkle根（或Tx_Root））發生的所有比特幣交易；每筆交易的記錄包含時間、發送者、接收者，以及該筆交易的比特幣數量。時間戳記錄該區塊的創建時間。\n\n一個區塊鏈由一系列的區塊構成，這些區塊被一個哈希函數（散列函數）連接起來。哈希函數是一種將數據轉換成一個十六進制編碼的密碼學，這些編碼不能倒回去重現原始輸入值。區塊12的頭部包含有反映區塊11內容的哈希函數，區塊11的頭部又有反映區塊10的內容的哈希函數，以此類推。這樣一來，要在前面的一個區塊上造假就是不可能的，因為這將會導致之後的所有區塊的哈希值都發生變化，因此這種造假就很會容易被察覺。若有人想要篡改歷史交易，那麼他/她就不得不為後續所有的區塊重新找到有效的哈希值。\n\n市場中任何一個參與者都可以更新一個公開區塊鏈的信息——沒有中心化的權威機構（不同於有土地註冊處在管理土地所有權）。要創建區塊13，一個參與者必須將新一筆交易的數據（並沒有被包含在之前的任何區塊裡）和區塊12的哈希值、時間戳，以及一個隨機數拼接在一起。一個隨機數就是和區塊中的其他信息結合在一起能夠生成一個新哈希值的隨機數字。有效的哈希值必須在某個範圍內，比如，必須有幾個零開頭。一個參與者需要不斷試錯，通過找到一個滿足要求的隨機數來生成區塊13對應的哈希值。一旦有一個參與者率先成功了，其他成員會檢驗並承認區塊13已經完成，然後去計算區塊14。\n\n這個勝出的參與者會得到12.5個比特幣的獎勵（在比特幣區塊鏈裡）；因此，這些有可能獲得獎勵的參與者就是我們所稱的礦工。這個獎勵鼓勵礦工將新交易拼接起來並建立新的區塊——這其實就是記賬服務費。礦工選擇他們想要包含在新區塊裡的任何交易，並對其進行編碼；一般不會有兩個礦工選中一模一樣的交易組合。想要迅速獲得交易證明的代理人，可以自願付給將其交易成功編入下個區塊的礦工一筆費用（作為激勵）。\n\n這篇論文也介紹了私有和許可區塊鏈。在兩種區塊鏈裡，記錄的更新是由一方或一個小組（由多方組成）來完成的。對這些區塊鏈的監管本身又是另一個很有意思的議題，那篇論文同樣也有提到。\n\n**區塊鏈會如何影響現實世界？**\n\n最有意思的是這篇論文關於區塊鏈潛在的變革性影響力的討論。\n\n* 所有權透明度增加。交易記錄將會即刻對每個人可見。目前，在美國，機構投資者頭寸的13F報告每季度只發布一次。此外，公司有三種不同的股東名單（公司、交易所、代理投票）；公司往往並不知道他們真正的股東是誰。\n  * 透明度可以讓投資者很難做到獲得一個區塊而不改變股價，這樣就會加重Grossman和Hart在1980年提出的搭便車問題（Kyle and Vila (1991)）。\n\n\n  * 透明度能夠阻止內部交易，並且相反會鼓勵外界獲得信息（Fishman and Hagerty (1992), Bushman, Piotoski, and Smith (2005)）。它同樣會使期權獎勵或者其他任何金融交易回溯的情況變為不可能。（Fishman and Hagerty (1992), Bushman, Piotoski, and Smith (2005)）\n* 更強的流動性。執行和完成股票交易可以更加迅速實惠。在美國，目前的結算往往需要3天時間並有多方介入才能完成。\n  * 流動性可以加強股東通過行使發言權（請見Maug (1998) 和Kahn and Winton (1998)的模型，及Norli, Ostergaard, and Schindele (2015)提出的證據）和退出投資（請見Admati and Pfleiderer (2009) 和Edmans (2009)的模型，及Edmans, Fang, and Zur (2013)，還有Roosenboom, Schlingemann, and Vasconcelos (2014)提出的證據）實現的公司治理。\n\n\n  * 不僅是活躍的股東，普通人也可以從中受益。目前，從蘇黎世匯款到紐約手續費是7%並且需要花3天時間。\n* 投票。區塊鏈可以用來記錄公司選舉的投票。這將會提高選舉準確性，並且化解關於管理層通過幕後操縱贏得絕大多數投票結果非常接近的選舉的顧慮。由於股票的借貸將會變得透明，區塊鏈同時也會讓空洞投票（模型搭建於Brav and Mathews (2011), 實證研究於Hu and Black (2006) 和Christoffersen, Geczy, Musto, and Reed (2007)）變得更難。\n* 實時記賬。一個公司可以在區塊鏈上發布其所有的商業交易，讓任何人在任何時候都可以合計出他們的損益表和資產負債表。這可以大大地減少對審計員的需求、防止應計盈餘管理、阻止關聯方交易。\n* 智能合約。智能合約是一種自動執行合約的方式：比如，如果借款人車貸違約，那麼無人駕駛汽車可以自己開回銀行。區塊鏈可以很低廉地執行智能合約，比如一違約就改變抵押物的所有權。這從根本上減少了強制執行的成本。金融學教授們以後可能就再也沒法寫關於扣押抵押品的難點的論文了！\n\n**這只是一個白日夢嗎？**\n\n許多革命性的科技都只是曇花一現，但有的卻真的帶來了變革性的影響。區塊鏈會不負眾望嗎？2016年的三個比較突出的活動表明了它也許可以。\n\n* 澳大利亞證券交易所公佈了一項計劃，該計劃準備使用區塊鏈技術來重新設計其清算和結算系統，其他許多主要證券市場也開展了探索性的項目。\n* 納斯達克證券交易所公佈了一個在股東會議上利用區塊鏈平台進行投票的試點計劃。管理幾乎所有美國大選計票工作的私企Broadridge開始下大力氣做相關研究，準備在美國公司選舉投票中使用區塊鏈。\n\n美國上市公司Overstock.com於2016年11月在一個區塊鏈上發行了股票，這樣他們雖然在監管機構處註冊了股份，但並沒有經過傳統的證券交易所。", "timestamp": 1653374266, "digest": "Yt7-Sk0HanUf_G7xB2PGu8b3XeboHg4wQr0X7rFE51A", "contributor": "0x91e41069F5300128bbdeed94659A3Fe28499FF1E"}

逐渐登场的亚洲力量\n\n红豆公售前迅速面世的亚洲项目“Phantabear”已经让NFT世界了解到“中文玩家NFT消费力”，短短2个月，不同ALPHA社区推介内容中“该社区中文玩家较为多”这一评价已从De-buff，变成了中立考量甚至加分项。\n\n无论是机遇还是必然，承载着NFT交易市场重要占比的中文玩家，此时需要一个贴近原生文化、符合个人审美的PFP NFT。\n\n在此之前的“蓝筹”少有明确的亚洲文化属性，一些出现在无聊猿中的日式配件甚至被指摘带有负面指向；而红豆的视觉设计避开了文化冲突，从人物五官到服饰风格，采用接受度广泛的日式动漫画风。\n\n##

Azuki启动之前团队在其他ALpha社区观察成员对Whitelist的讨论，并确定运营逻辑\n\n· 不在参与推文的人中抽白虽然能迅速传播项目，因为不是“坚实的受众”\n\n· 不公开所选中的核心用户推特，以防止骗局DM\n\n· 取消公售，最后17个名额以公平方式在社区分配\n\n· 集成验证holder功能到官网，不直接引用现成机器人\n\n……\n\n## 社群——以“核心文化”留住真正粉丝\n\n红豆社区从一开始就完全**摒弃了“邀请人数和提升等级”来虚张规模**——“真正参与其中”是获得白名单的唯一方式；**“培养真正的核心成员，让豆子缓慢发芽”**，这让社群成员有着较高共识。\n\n没有“邀请拿白制”，所以经历了较长的运营周期后，红豆的discord依旧处于**相对封闭**的状态。\n\n我们能够因此明白，纸面数字增长也许真的意义不大，聚拢有价值的真实玩家更重要。另一条——合理规则带来的自主筛选，而非用技术手段可破解的、用以营造稀缺感的限时开门，一定能够吸引到优质Holder。\n\n令人头疼的是现在很多项目依旧选择discord邀请限时/限量开放等办法，企图规避工作室，而不以相信能够凭借自身洞察与判断以选中优秀的社区成员——这反而很多时候阻拦了粉丝，场外交易已经不止售卖白名单，也开始打包售卖“进门”dis账号。\n\n发售不久前、令人惊叹的fan-art出圈后，豆子才被很多规模化的工作室注意到，此时他们已经少有进入其中的机会。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HzOxw_1ZkauKNodVFC0ds.png?height=498&width=541)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5_O9LrQlVrGqTruUECRhP.png?height=624&width=537)\n\n## 发售方式与开源合约——研磨者、革新者、分享者\n\n不用赘述红豆的合约有多出名——红豆dev改进后推出以极低gas、更快速度完成mint的合约，“革新但不私藏”的做法让它成为“以gas war反映项目热度”行业中的一股清流。\n\n（官方对gas的介绍推文：<https://twitter.com/AzukiZen/status/1479235139167207432?s=20&t=obcIDGbhUxUiTazYosRZzA>）\n\n**分享意味着分利？**\n\n红豆discord中创建了一个频道，以供dev在其中分享和答疑——我们也称之为格局，但“分享精神”是笔者在最初接触加密行业时最为感概的一点。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hyyLdKUeh3YKPYlh1S5Cu.png?height=214&width=1203)\n\n（加密世界很多黑客，但也有很多热心有爱的技术人员——共建社区时“为爱发电”，后续换来项目方的主动给予，“撸毛”行业源于此，也被卡bug于此）\n\n后续不少项目方感谢红豆带来行业革新——作为技术外行对此也非常感慨，它让小资金玩家能省下并不便宜的gas，提升Mint体验——很多前期热度不错、独具风格项目**因技术而被FUD**——白名单无限mint/白名单不能mint/无法承载攻击而发射延迟/前端崩溃合约提前……\n\n此外，红豆的发行逻辑也值得一提（不少其他项目方也采取了类似做法）——\n\n“荷兰拍 → 荷兰拍结束价格的一半进行白名单销售 → 剩余公售（最后17只取消了公售，进行社区内选择）”\n\n常规的“白名单先mint”方式，大概率有着“地板拉高，后续荷兰拍更容易以高价结束”的剧情，但是先进行荷兰拍的方式**更加考验玩家对项目预期和评判**，在没有任何稳定盈利参考的基础上，也能**筛选掉完全不care项目本身的套利者**。\n\n技术让人消落，也助人崛起，行事初衷决定它的走向。\n\n## 未来规划——品牌建设、文创周边、代币经济\n\n路书——告诉别人“卖光后，我们计划怎么办”。\n\n高盈利、高变化的市场，不少项目方mint结束便会另起炉灶开启新一轮收割，这也是很多玩家初评项目需要了解“roadmap”的重要原因，当然编造roadmap也是大割信手拈来的事儿。\n\n近日，Azuki 将碎片化Token#40 (Bobu) ，作为它去中心化治理的尝试，碎片持有人作为dao成员集体治理和决定Bobu IP的未来。\n\n![（官网介绍：https://www.azuki.com/bobu-101#bobu-101）](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7krMlSrNIU4HlHmCZk4Sq.png?height=302&width=310)\n\n我们可以在官网中看到，红豆NFT的发行仅仅是它品牌化的第一步——元宇宙3D艺术部署（以鸟屋为特征等日式场景）、实体周边、剧情短片、代币经济或者游戏……\n\n‘Take it slow and stay focused on the long-game.’\n\n很多规划尚未面世，红豆缓步推进蓝图，我们也拭目以待。\n\n引用推特@_Kaspar__的话：\n\n• “到处都是骗局和低质量的项目”\n\n• “找到真正的质量和长期价值变得越来越难”\n\n• “就算你不喜欢红豆，也应该在这其中了解到不错的NFT是什么样子”\n\n## 男豆、女豆——玩家性别比例的真实反应\n\n粉丝愿意换为头像时，项目的地板和成交或许反映了什么——Azuki的男豆地板比女豆要高——当然**不少男性玩家因为某个女豆长得像现/前女友而求购**，但这也非常明确地告诉我们，NFT世界里女性玩家比男性少太多。\n\n与朋友的交流中发现，女性玩家在寻找潜力蓝筹上有着不太相同的取向和见解，但因为技术门槛或者一些环境因素，进入NFT世界女生还太少。自己喜欢的几个活跃的微信群，包括红豆官方中文社区，真实的女性玩家比例也不超过10％。\n\n我们讨论女权，炒作女性艺术家，但是带领女生了解这个领域的人到底多不多呢？\n\n另一点，女性玩家比较少，所以可能少有人提到“饭圈”——**NFT和饭圈非常相似**。\n\n· 项目方、项目本身是明星工作室和面临出道/已经当红的艺人；\n\n· 团队成员找到具有输出能力的核心粉丝成为粉头（MOD）；\n\n· 也有需要对接不同渠道（社区）的运营；\n\n· 少不了与其他艺人（项目合作）联动的CP营销；\n\n· Dis可以理解为超话，一切fan-art都是粉丝产出周边；\n\n· 优秀的fan-art或内推有机会成为后援会会员（Whitelist），获得提前购买官方产品的机会；\n\n· 吃瓜（FUD）过程中也需要带着自己的判断甄别黑料来源、散布者的目的；\n\n· 可以不喜欢但也无需拉踩别的流量，喜欢什么就在有共识的社区（dis、tele、微信群等）圈地自萌、强化信仰。\n\n一切在饭圈行得通的准则这里同样适用，所以必然**只有颜值和实力兼具的流量，才能在尘埃落定后不塌房、成为常青树。**\n\n有人全靠包装和炒作，就有人研磨业务水平；有人利用粉丝经济牟利，就有人因践行正向价值；有人因为Mint了新墙头，也有人觉得自己的朴素豆子香；有红豆这样多维度评价都不错的新星，就让人对一定会出现的下一个优质爱豆充满期待……\n\n## 最后，我们究竟喜欢什么呢？\n\n**我们喜欢被尊重的视觉艺术——**\n\n喜欢红豆中能找到的东方美学共鸣，喜欢画进图里的不敷衍和对持有者的尊重，喜欢1万个角色自带的生命力、故事感，喜欢一张图片带来的广阔想象空间……\n\n**我们喜欢统一而高标准的品牌化运作方式——**\n\n喜欢它从推特、dis到官网都有着正规军该有的样子，喜欢一切具有红豆审美的推广视频、原创音乐、活动策划，喜欢官网的视觉设计、精心架构和贴心而流畅的实用功能……\n\n**喜欢相对公平和平等的WL选择方式——**\n\n喜欢拒绝以cx和pua来制造热度、虚张规模，喜欢更看重创意和质量的选择；喜欢科学家和工作室难钻空子的规则设计，喜欢决策者以平等的姿态对待粉丝……\n\n**我们喜欢凝聚着创造力的平等社区——**\n\n喜欢友善而热情的交流，喜欢Holder和关注者们创作时的无目的，喜欢有趣有才的甚至比原图更棒的粉丝艺术，喜欢分享作品后收到的真诚鼓励和赞扬；\n\n**我们喜欢决心驶向广袤也踏实做事的项目方——**\n\n喜欢Azuki诞生之际就有着深远的考量，喜欢团队践行了他们“Trust the process”的理念；喜欢决策者认真对待每一个细节、尊重社区；喜欢他们继续吸纳力量，扩充成员……\n\n**喜欢革新体验、能力与责任兼具的技术——**\n\n喜欢红豆dev创新了721a合约；喜欢项目方做足功课、拒绝甩锅、以技术实力制定了行业新标；喜欢他们极具区块链精神的分享；喜欢他们考虑用户的初衷……\n\n**我们喜欢可期盼、也可执行的蓝图——**\n\n喜欢没有人许下浮夸又笃定承诺，喜欢一切有迹可循的进程，喜欢即将到来的去中心化治理尝试，喜欢不久后即将上线的文创周边和元宇宙布局……\n\n**我们喜欢美，喜欢收藏美——视觉、音乐、价值、氛围……**\n\n我们希望在收藏美的同时盈利，但最终期望拥有的，也许只是能在其中获得认可和荣誉感的自己。\n\n部分资料来源——\n\n推特用户：[@locationtba](https://twitter.com/locationtba)

BTC大级别（三角）是突破，按理小级别应该服从大级别，2小时级别突破了，15分钟的回踩应该不会很强。\n\n \n\n1. 此时我手里的ENS、KSM、KAVA都已陆续突破，盈利比较可观。大量山寨构筑强烈的向上预期，我希望抗一抗波动。\n\n \n\n1. 前天的那个楔形转头肩顶转三角突破的案例就在不远，我认为当前情况下这次的楔形也有概率这么走。\n\n \n\n**直到这个时候，我认为我的操作和思路都没有什么太大错误。**\n\n \n\n**到了晚上，美股开盘，大饼却莫名的快速下杀然后V反。**\n\n \n\n**正好构筑了一个头肩顶，其实如果是一个更成熟的交易者这种结构应该走了。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ev3qUq8KhARjNSgfR_Tub.png?height=748&width=1400)\n\n 但是我却没走，我的逻辑同样有3点：\n\n \n\n1. 先前那波下杀正好完成二探回踩，我认为很健康。\n\n \n\n1. 美股没有跌，反而高开。\n\n \n\n1. 和之前一样，认为小级别要服从大级别；且这里可能做一个图表转换，构筑个上涨中继。\n\n \n\n**这个逻辑我现在看来同样没问题，我如果此时走还能有一点利润，后面的操作才是我亏损的最直接原因。**\n\n \n\nBTC构筑完头肩顶后又再次快速下破，甚至跌破了三角的上边界，这个时候没有理由不跑，我却在下方不断的画支撑位，希望在某一个点被支撑柱并开启反弹。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RVoYsSE1SuYjjL-38Swes.png?height=566&width=1400)\n\n事实证明我错了，最后是一路下杀，无视一切支撑，直接跌穿到三角的下边界。我昨天的操作以严重亏损结局。\n\n \n\n**事后来看，前期都一切顺利，但是当行情走势和我预期有偏差时，我开始不断犯错：**\n\n \n\n1. **过分解读行情。当行情和预期不一致就开始不断找其他的可能性，试图让行情走势重新回到我的预期当中。**\n\n \n\n1. **没有交易纪律。做的是图表，当图表走坏了就应该无条件离场，我却心存侥幸，认为自己手里拿的现货不会出现爆仓，不愿意止损。**\n\n \n\n虽然这次我都是现货，不会爆仓。并且大饼是大仓位，山寨是小仓位，但是明明我可以做的更好。\n\n \n\n盈利的时候到边界为什么不主动止盈？盈利变亏损的时候我为什么还一直心存侥幸？我的交易心态还需要磨练。", "timestamp": 1653374386, "digest": "4tBpCgR8DVmB5kT5cgyjBDALO03sl2v58FsnXOj2S-M", "contributor": "0xB2f362e3296A6d88E9a46FA733D18EC319494819"}

Mt's will re-define your social relationship graph. Mt's image tells us that when we started to enter the crypto world, many people are the watchers, they were or surprised, or skeptical, or excited, or afraid. However, as an objective rule, the arrival of anything new alway create chaos, some won, some lost, some waited and waited.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0AmbCbCggDrMmh6nH_Zvh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n### Participation\n\n**Mt's are issued in 12600 pieces.** Every Mt's has its unique characteristics and rarity. Mt's will help you realize your social value, allowing you to gain fun and income from your social connections and behavior. Mt's wants to flip the NFT market with new form of energy. NFT shall not be the chips in the hand of the rich, at least that’s not Mt’s. Mt’s owners help each other in a way that no one has ever done.\n\n**Mt's will issue the first 50 pieces as the seed, half of which will be given as Whitelist to those who have participated and contributed in Mt’s early stages, the other half goes to the first official mint pool where everyone can participate.**\n\nTo obtain the first 50 Mt’s are required to go to Mt’s website, log into personal page for the Invitation Code(IC). ICs are the permission to participate mint. Make sure IC in the pocket prior to each mint round.\n\n**Mt's mint uses an incremental model with an initial price of 0.09 ETH.**  \n\n![Totally 6\\*round mint](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kiQWX7xPDP5Em54uLfSrV.png?height=1434&width=2794)\n\n## Beyond the PFPs, go ride with mtier!\n\n### Mtier Rank Program\n\nIn order to promote Mt’s influence and build solid relationship among members, Mt’s has its unique incentive program, the Mtier Rank Program(MRP). Once user own Mt’s NFT, he/she becomes a mtier Noob. After completing 2\\*invites and both invitees successful mint Mt’s, mtier Noob go to the rank, the MRP automatically kicks in.\n\nEach mtier has his/her rank(except the Noob), ranks come with different allowances. \n MRP reward is made of two parts: Share reward and Royalties. \n Share reward is an invitation-oriented incentive.\n\n**i.g.** \n Mtier1 invites 2\\*mtier2 and both mtier2 sucessfully mint Mt’s NFT, mtier1 will gain 24% share reward from mtier2’s mint costs.   \n If mtier2 has his/her own 2\\*mtier3 minted Mt’s NFT, mtier2 will gain 24% share reward from mtier3’s mint costs, meanwhile mtier1 gains 12%  share reward from mtier3’s mint costs.\n\nAlso mtiers will gain 10% of the royalties when their Mt’s NFT in Opensea, etc. \n The specific allowance rate chart shows as following:\n\n![The specific allowance rate chart](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5jLNtGnQ7MdFkIxiQH2xx.png?height=1645&width=3761)\n\n### Funds Allocation\n\n**All mint funds will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 50.87% will go to Mtier Rank Program.  \n 24.13% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 25% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**Royalty income will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 2.49% will be awarded to all users holding NFT and participating in the invitation. \n 3% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 4.45% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**The Mt’s Community Treasury:**  \n 20% of the Foundation's funds will be used for acquisitions and marketing. \n 80% will be reserved for bonuses.\n\n\\*When only 5% of total market Mt's NFT are remained, all bonuses will be shared equally.\n\n### Mt's DAO\n\nAll users holding Mt's NFT are members of Mt's DAO. Mt's DAO members can vote in project decisions and can decide how to use bonuses and whether to acquire new NFTs. Mt's DAO will in future be involved and influence the development of Mt's NFT as the core decision maker of Mt's NFT.\n\n### Reward collection\n\nThe mtier who have activated the rewards, can collect them on Mt’s official website. In order to better motivate new comer, Mt's NFT has been reorganized on the collection mechanism-all Mt's NFT that has collected rewards will be automatically destroyed. This deflation mechanism can increase the value of retained Mt 's NFT. After destruction, designated mtier will receive a new vMt's NFT as a credential to record your existing social network.\n\n### vMt's NFT Function\n\nvMt's NFT is a derivative NFT after the original Mt's NFT is destroyed. 20% of vMt's NFT will be used as the seed for the next project and the rest can be redeemed for future CON LAB new projects. Holding vMt's NFT will also continue to maintain your existing social connections, meaning you will continue to increase the value  your social connections. Further more, Holding vMt's NFT will also give you the opportunity to receive token airdrops.\n\n### Mt's redefines NFT\n\n\"The next era will be defined by today's social networking sites and the depth of connection given to users, and our job is to find the best way for users to share themselves\" - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nThe value of relationships is based on the sharing economy, which means sharing one's state of being, one's information, one's interests, one's hobbies. The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing. Mt’s aims to build a perpetual social-fi  generator in Web3.\n\nThe CON LAB will create a decentralized NFT trading platform driven by influencers and the community through a perpetual network of social connections, with the proceeds of each transaction distributed to the platform's NFT holders to enjoy perpetual dividends and a true return of equity to the user.\n\n## What is Mt's\n\n***The Made-it's , The Miss-it's, The My-turn's!***\n\nThis was a great movement that will eventually be remembered in crypto history. Free from the interference of capitals and authorities. There are no losers in this movement.\n\nThis time we are not a bystander, we are expressing our emotions in a way that will influence more crypto practitioners.\n\nFrom this moment on, Mt's will change the world.\n\n### Follow Mt’s\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MtsNFTs)    |    [Disocrd](https://discord.gg/TK3VCgH4pR)    |    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUahYxfJ2xaB9W9js3ifWQ)\n\n## Don't wait&see, up with Mt’s.", "timestamp": 1653374712, "digest": "vyA5575rvQ7kbqkumCcLLXqMptIBWzFhFzwE4MfQexc", "contributor": "0x5b23A5d907805a4dcFBe13aE232442A6746c5C9C"}

{"id": "UqIyN26vJmursQ9uPNHRYtIJEPY-4QFfVP6YZ9owp94", "title": "The Stargate Omnichain mission", "body": "Hello earthlings!\n\nIt's no longer news about the first omnichain Fungible token: [Stargate finance](https://stargate.finance/), which is built on [LayerZero protocol.](https://layerzero.network/)                                                                                               The Omnichain Fungible token (OFT) title, was derived from its mobility on chain i.e.  the ability of $STG to move freely between all chains Layer zero exists.\n\n   This was made possible by solving the Bridging Trilemma, via **the *Delta (Δ)* algorithm**.\n\n[Ryan Zarick](https://twitter.com/ryanzarick?lang=en), co-founder and CTO of LayerZero outlined in indepth in the [Bridging Trilemma](https://medium.com/stargate-official/the-bridging-trilemma-d80788cce4ef).\n\n##             Introducing the Delta (Δ) algorithm.\n\n The *Delta (Δ)*  algorithm is a novel resource balancing algorithm that enables *unified native asset pools* on all chains while also providing *Instant Guaranteed Finality.*\n\n *Delta (Δ) algorithm* ticked all three boxes in the Bridging Trilemma and proved to be the first algorithm with attractive features capable of an ideal bridge.\n\nThe effect of this solution encompasses many on-chain activities.                               This is a modification to the  **lock + mint + Redeem**  mechanism of synthetic assets which can induce fragmented liquidity.\n\n With bridging trilemma solved, we can now simultaneously have deep pools of native assets tied to all chains, creating orders of magnitude greater capital efficiency.         LPs will be able to stake into a singled-sided asset pool with no impermanent loss and collect fees from all incoming transfers regardless of their source chain. This would save users the time and fees needed to swap out undesirable synthetics on the destination chain or have a scenario where a transfer fails due to state change.\n\n##                The fundamental security limit of bridges.\n\nGenerally, there are different perspectives to an ideal bridge either via “multi-chain” or “cross-chain” but both are limited to some fundamental securities which have proven to be honeypots for exploits.\n\nThese different perspectives steered up some healthy argument as [Vitalik](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin), co-founder of Ethereum blockchain remains optimistic about a multi-chain blockchain ecosystem rather than cross-chain applications.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uGoVsCU_R0fOfbW29FKXY.png?height=562&width=582)\n\nHowever, instead of fighting over influence on the mutual goal which is “The fundamental security”. We can as well derive means/protocols to mitigate the risks to the barest minimum.\n\nFollowing his argument tweet, he also acknowledged the quality of cross-rollup apps within “one zone of sovereignty”. Noting that, it is also a limit to the \"modular blockchains\" vision.  The key word “one zone of sovereignty”, Could this be Stargate on [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) ?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M7zDmYv1avOX68EsLN7Ch.png?height=276&width=596)\n\nWhat if we can limit these risks, by getting the roll-ups within one zone of sovereignty like he said. Seems like a blockchain myth, How’s that possible ?   \n\nThink of an interoperable Omnichain protocol, leveraging on the security properties of Chainlink and Band oracles. Yes, that's [Layer zero](https://layerzero.network/); the skeleton framework of Stargate.         Ryan Zarick, explained how the interoperability works in his post on [LayerZero- An Omnichain Interoperability Protocol](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/layerzero-an-omnichain-interoperability-protocol-b43d2ae975b6)\n\nMeanwhile, Vitalik’s perspective on multichain over cross-chain focuses on ***wrapped assets as the solution.***                                                                                                                                                         The premises of his argument relies on “the limits to the security of bridges that hop across multiple zones of sovereignty”.\n\n##        Mechanism of wrapped assets Vs Stargate cross-chain\n\n There is no doubt that latency has proven to be a function of security and as such, the latent period shouldn’t be subjected to any sort of risk**.**                                              Meanwhile, one of ***the issues of a wrapped asset being the solution- is the risk on the duration of the transaction.***\n\n    To explain this clearly, let's zoom out to the user side:  A user with $1000 Eth on its  native chain A wants the same value of ETH on another chain B.\n\n> ***Using Stargate***: The user deposits hid preferred ETH value on chain A and gets out the same equivalent value of Eth in his preferred currency on his preferred chain.  Everything happens immediately, Bridge did its job and you have your cryptocurrency on your desired chain.\n\n  In a case of an uncertainty or dilemma where stargate is subjected to an exploit and probably goes to zero, You're all out in safe hands.\n\n> ***Using a wrapped asset*** : The user locks up the $1000 Eth on chain A and mints the equivalent value of synthetic Eth value on chain B.                                                         This transaction is not yet complete as long as the value of ETH on chain B is subjected to the risk of its equivalent value of Eth on chain A.\n\nIn a case of an uncertainty or dilemma where the original ETH on chain A is removed, then your  Synthetic Eth is now worthless.\n\n##       Wrapped assets and Smart contract risk.\n\nWrapped assets works on a **(lock + mint + redeem)** mechanism and there are multiple angles of attack on smart contracts with this model.                                                     This could be  local smart contract risks, which may include poorly written codes that are vulnerable to exploits and hackers.\n\nLocal smart contract risks can be controlled yet seem inevitable for every smart-contracts.\n\nSeveral Audits can examine and do the best of their job but then there are other two angles of outstanding risk which are inescapable, these risks could be derived from *the validation mechanism and fraudulent messages.*                                                            This can be evident in the recent hack events,  where a hacker stuffs in some sort of false code(fraudulent messages) aiming at either  tricking the source contract to deliver false messages to the destination chain OR by directly tricking the destination chain to automate messages that aren't from the source code.\n\n[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) has always proven to be ahead of the emerging risks with the advent of “stop the hack\" protocol known as **[Pre-crime](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/introducing-pre-crime-49bef4a581d5?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------)**.\n\n##                Introducing Pre-crime\n\nTransport layers are really innocent of the exploits, as most of the catastrophes are smart contract related and has nothing to do with transport layer. Yet these transport layers deliver the final fatality.\n\n End of worries, with the launch ***Pre-crime*** we could prevent the final blow from being delivered.\n\n         Pre-Crime initiates the ability for a relayer to stop a hack before it happens.      This is achieved by forking the destination blockchain before delivering the message and running the transaction locally.                                                                                  Pre-Crime also involves the authentication to check the state of the blockchain in relation to the other connected blockchains to confirm no malicious action occurred. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hb5TBC01De7O_m0ho9pvb.png?height=352&width=704)\n\nYou can read more about the additional layer of security : **[Pre-crime](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/introducing-pre-crime-49bef4a581d5)**.\n\nThis is just one of many steps LayerZero is taking to ensure the security of the omnichain future. \n\nThe ultimate goal of Stargate is to mitigate the risks of cross-chain swaps to the barest minimum. \n\nIn pursuit of this ultimate goal, several other sub-goals have been attained such as : Optimized volume and fees for swaps, transfers and LP.                                             **$STG**, the omnichain fungible token is the rocket science behind all these.\n\n##  What’s Next\n\nThere's a lot going on, such as the Pre-crime, DEX integrations etc.\n\nThe Stargate team also cares about the community and the growth of Stargate protocol. That's why DAO governance is in place. It is vital to bring all forces together to build a strong protocol.            \n\nTo ensure the efficacy of the governance, the community decided to use the Common wealth platform as the Forum that Stargate will be using for Proposals and Governance.\n\nBright minds can now come together, discuss and draft proposals.

After completing 2\\*invites and both invitees successful mint Mt’s, mtier Noob go to the rank, the MRP automatically kicks in.\n\nEach mtier has his/her rank(except the Noob), ranks come with different allowances. \n MRP reward is made of two parts: Share reward and Royalties. \n Share reward is an invitation-oriented incentive.\n\n**i.g.** \n Mtier1 invites 2\\*mtier2 and both mtier2 sucessfully mint Mt’s NFT, mtier1 will gain 24% share reward from mtier2’s mint costs.   \n If mtier2 has his/her own 2\\*mtier3 minted Mt’s NFT, mtier2 will gain 24% share reward from mtier3’s mint costs, meanwhile mtier1 gains 12%  share reward from mtier3’s mint costs.\n\nAlso mtiers will gain 10% of the royalties when their Mt’s NFT in Opensea, etc. \n The specific allowance rate chart shows as following:\n\n![The specific allowance rate chart](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5jLNtGnQ7MdFkIxiQH2xx.png?height=1645&width=3761)\n\n### Funds Allocation\n\n**All mint funds will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 50.87% will go to Mtier Rank Program.  \n 24.13% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 25% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**Royalty income will be distributed according to the following rules:** \n 2.49% will be awarded to all users holding NFT and participating in the invitation. \n 3% will be awarded to the CON LAB. \n 4.45% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**The Mt’s Community Treasury:**  \n 20% of the Foundation's funds will be used for acquisitions and marketing. \n 80% will be reserved for bonuses.\n\n\\*When only 5% of total market Mt's NFT are remained, all bonuses will be shared equally.\n\n### Mt's DAO\n\nAll users holding Mt's NFT are members of Mt's DAO. Mt's DAO members can vote in project decisions and can decide how to use bonuses and whether to acquire new NFTs. Mt's DAO will in future be involved and influence the development of Mt's NFT as the core decision maker of Mt's NFT.\n\n### Reward collection\n\nThe mtier who have activated the rewards, can collect them on Mt’s official website. In order to better motivate new comer, Mt's NFT has been reorganized on the collection mechanism-all Mt's NFT that has collected rewards will be automatically destroyed. This deflation mechanism can increase the value of retained Mt 's NFT. After destruction, designated mtier will receive a new vMt's NFT as a credential to record your existing social network.\n\n### vMt's NFT Function\n\nvMt's NFT is a derivative NFT after the original Mt's NFT is destroyed. 20% of vMt's NFT will be used as the seed for the next project and the rest can be redeemed for future CON LAB new projects. Holding vMt's NFT will also continue to maintain your existing social connections, meaning you will continue to increase the value  your social connections. Further more, Holding vMt's NFT will also give you the opportunity to receive token airdrops.\n\n### Mt's redefines NFT\n\n\"The next era will be defined by today's social networking sites and the depth of connection given to users, and our job is to find the best way for users to share themselves\" - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nThe value of relationships is based on the sharing economy, which means sharing one's state of being, one's information, one's interests, one's hobbies. The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing. Mt’s aims to build a perpetual social-fi  generator in Web3.\n\nThe CON LAB will create a decentralized NFT trading platform driven by influencers and the community through a perpetual network of social connections, with the proceeds of each transaction distributed to the platform's NFT holders to enjoy perpetual dividends and a true return of equity to the user.\n\n## What is Mt's\n\n***The Made-it's , The Miss-it's, The My-turn's!***\n\nThis was a great movement that will eventually be remembered in crypto history. Free from the interference of capitals and authorities. There are no losers in this movement.\n\nThis time we are not a bystander, we are expressing our emotions in a way that will influence more crypto practitioners.\n\nFrom this moment on, Mt's will change the world.\n\n### Follow Mt’s\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MtsNFTs)    |    [Disocrd](https://discord.gg/TK3VCgH4pR)    |    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUahYxfJ2xaB9W9js3ifWQ)\n\n## Don't wait&see, up with Mt’s.", "timestamp": 1653375547, "digest": "vyA5575rvQ7kbqkumCcLLXqMptIBWzFhFzwE4MfQexc", "contributor": "0x5b23A5d907805a4dcFBe13aE232442A6746c5C9C"}

{"id": "agG2Gmq37069TNowr-MtnS86rr2aAeNdSf2P2f5I79o", "title": "千倍合约小教程", "body": "在开始之前，要提醒几个事：\n\n第一最好不要玩合约。除非你知道自己在做什么，但因为在币圈几乎大多数人最后都会去了解合约，那我建议你除非学习并实践过一年以上，否则，最多用300U和5X以下，以学习的心态，否则，相信我，结果一定是亏损。\n\n第二合约赚不了大钱。大钱要靠大趋势的现货，我们一起等熊市，我会告诉大家买什么。\n\n第三控制仓位最重要。要开合约，我也只建议5X以下，而且尽量大趋势下开，比如LUNA这种大崩，小钱玩一玩，实际上大仓位的人，0.5X都有爆仓几千万的人。但是倍数也和你的仓位相关，比如10U开50X，在全仓模式下等于100U开5X（逐仓的话永远只能5X以下），所以几乎只建议一个人永远只开一个固定倍数，比如交易大神静海飞鱼，永远是50X，但仓位占总仓位比例小。\n\n第四逐仓最多5X。如果是满仓，那么，最多开5X，10X已经是赌博了，至于20X、100X，那不存在的，因为没有好的止损工具存在，没有意义。\n\n**下面再开始讲教程（注意：如果看不懂，不要操作）**\n\n首先，问一个问题：30U本金，开千倍合约，理论上相当于仓位300U开*100倍，3000U*10倍，30000U 1倍一样，但是会开出来就爆仓？为什么我不10倍，而是傻子一样要千倍呢？有任何操作性？\n\n其实如前所说，10X都是高风险，那么，肯定要通过诀窍来享受到1000倍的福利，但最好只承担10X以下的风险。诀窍就是**借钱生钱，亏借的，不亏本金。**\n\n具体操作：\n\n30U的总仓位，起手开一个0.03U\\*1000X，其实相当于30U开10X，所以并不存在开单就爆仓，如果方向开对了，这个0.03U会迅速产生利润，如产生了200U利润，现在关键来了。\n\n设置一个保本的止损——把30U本金转走，你现在有利润200U有一个千倍的单子——在单边行情中，用利润可以在合适的时候慢慢加仓，这个时机和加仓大小很讲究，如果加早了、加大了，白忙一场，加小了，感觉浪费了机会。\n\n简单来说，就是总仓位放一点点小钱，但由于这一点点小钱通过起手开非常小的但是杠杆非常高的单子，于是亏损就是30U，盈利是按千倍走，而且和低杠杆不同的是，行情轻微波动，利润都变化很大，于是很容易用利润加仓，如果方向正确，而且加仓谨慎，很容易获得一个不错的回报——而风险就在于一开始方向错了，类似30U开10倍，爆了也无所谓，亏损就是这30U，但利润的话……\n\n这样，手续费之类都不在乎了，而且如果盈利了，及时锁定本金，确保不亏。利润如果增长了，用利润滚仓，碰到单边行情就不得了。\n\n我就是在比特币突破2万时，开了2U的千倍，后来用利润加仓到46U的本金，最后多的时候赚了近4万U，交易所把所有人盈利的单子强平了，钱发给大家，产品下架……当时群里很多人都是非常大的利润。一气之下，当即就让所有人从交易所提币走人了， 还好走了，现在A网已经登录不上了，所以推荐大家在币安\\\\OKX\\\\FTX三大所之外的交易所都不要放太多钱了。\n\n总结关键词就是：**极小仓位**，比如30U本金（我个人是300U，开0.3U起步）；**利润锁定**，只要赚了，就及时通过止损工具，确保不会被爆仓之类，把本金先转走。\n\n目前只有HOO有千倍，省手续费注册链接如下，HOO是个老牌交易所，不过我也是千倍才用它：\n\nhttps://www.hoo.tc/invite/26748434", "timestamp": 1653376323, "digest": "5olx9by6BhJLdDoM0dDOzPa3EjQdyOhRvNyO0s_kIgA", "contributor": "0x7A470d8014a122245b0410774618B7ED0E990Daa"}

{"id": "KC3rAY2b-Y-1Noj-kZMTIG_EcZrMsBMMG761bQOL_HA", "title": "The Stargate Omnichain mission", "body": "Hello earthlings!\n\nIt's no longer news about the first omnichain Fungible token: [Stargate finance](https://stargate.finance/), which is built on [LayerZero protocol.](https://layerzero.network/)                                                                                               The Omnichain Fungible token (OFT) title, was derived from its mobility on chain i.e.  the ability of $STG to move freely between all chains Layer zero exists.\n\nThis was made possible by solving the Bridging Trilemma, via **the *Delta (Δ)* algorithm**.\n\n[Ryan Zarick](https://twitter.com/ryanzarick?lang=en), co-founder and CTO of LayerZero outlined in indepth in the [Bridging Trilemma](https://medium.com/stargate-official/the-bridging-trilemma-d80788cce4ef).\n\n## Introducing the Delta (Δ) algorithm.\n\nThe *Delta (Δ)*  algorithm is a novel resource balancing algorithm that enables *unified native asset pools* on all chains while also providing *Instant Guaranteed Finality.*\n\n*Delta (Δ) algorithm* ticked all three boxes in the Bridging Trilemma and proved to be the first algorithm with attractive features capable of an ideal bridge.\n\nThe effect of this solution encompasses many on-chain activities.                               This is a modification to the  **lock + mint + Redeem**  mechanism of synthetic assets which can induce fragmented liquidity.\n\nWith bridging trilemma solved, we can now simultaneously have deep pools of native assets tied to all chains, creating orders of magnitude greater capital efficiency.         LPs will be able to stake into a singled-sided asset pool with no impermanent loss and collect fees from all incoming transfers regardless of their source chain. This would save users the time and fees needed to swap out undesirable synthetics on the destination chain or have a scenario where a transfer fails due to state change.\n\n## The fundamental security limit of bridges.\n\nGenerally, there are different perspectives to an ideal bridge either via “multi-chain” or “cross-chain” but both are limited to some fundamental securities which have proven to be honeypots for exploits.\n\nThese different perspectives steered up some healthy argument as [Vitalik](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin), co-founder of Ethereum blockchain remains optimistic about a multi-chain blockchain ecosystem rather than cross-chain applications.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uGoVsCU_R0fOfbW29FKXY.png?height=562&width=582)\n\nHowever, instead of fighting over influence on the mutual goal which is “The fundamental security”. We can as well derive means/protocols to mitigate the risks to the barest minimum.\n\nFollowing his argument tweet, he also acknowledged the quality of cross-rollup apps within “one zone of sovereignty”. Noting that, it is also a limit to the \"modular blockchains\" vision.  The key word “one zone of sovereignty”, Could this be Stargate on [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) ?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M7zDmYv1avOX68EsLN7Ch.png?height=276&width=596)\n\nWhat if we can limit these risks, by getting the roll-ups within one zone of sovereignty like he said. Seems like a blockchain myth, How’s that possible ?\n\nThink of an interoperable Omnichain protocol, leveraging on the security properties of Chainlink and Band oracles. Yes, that's [Layer zero](https://layerzero.network/); the skeleton framework of Stargate.         Ryan Zarick, explained how the interoperability works in his post on [LayerZero- An Omnichain Interoperability Protocol](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/layerzero-an-omnichain-interoperability-protocol-b43d2ae975b6)\n\nMeanwhile, Vitalik’s perspective on multichain over cross-chain focuses on ***wrapped assets as the solution.***                                                                                                                                                         The premises of his argument relies on “the limits to the security of bridges that hop across multiple zones of sovereignty”.\n\n## Mechanism of wrapped assets Vs Stargate cross-chain\n\nThere is no doubt that latency has proven to be a function of security and as such, the latent period shouldn’t be subjected to any sort of risk\\*\\*.\\*\\*                                              Meanwhile, one of ***the issues of a wrapped asset being the solution- is the risk on the duration of the transaction.***\n\nTo explain this clearly, let's zoom out to the user side:  A user with $1000 Eth on its  native chain A wants the same value of ETH on another chain B.\n\n> ***Using Stargate***: The user deposits hid preferred ETH value on chain A and gets out the same equivalent value of Eth in his preferred currency on his preferred chain.  Everything happens immediately, Bridge did its job and you have your cryptocurrency on your desired chain.\n\nIn a case of an uncertainty or dilemma where stargate is subjected to an exploit and probably goes to zero, You're all out in safe hands.\n\n> ***Using a wrapped asset*** : The user locks up the $1000 Eth on chain A and mints the equivalent value of synthetic Eth value on chain B.                                                         This transaction is not yet complete as long as the value of ETH on chain B is subjected to the risk of its equivalent value of Eth on chain A.\n\nIn a case of an uncertainty or dilemma where the original ETH on chain A is removed, then your  Synthetic Eth is now worthless.\n\n## Wrapped assets and Smart contract risk.\n\nWrapped assets works on a **(lock + mint + redeem)** mechanism and there are multiple angles of attack on smart contracts with this model.                                                     This could be  local smart contract risks, which may include poorly written codes that are vulnerable to exploits and hackers.\n\nLocal smart contract risks can be controlled yet seem inevitable for every smart-contracts.\n\nSeveral Audits can examine and do the best of their job but then there are other two angles of outstanding risk which are inescapable, these risks could be derived from *the validation mechanism and fraudulent messages.*                                                            This can be evident in the recent hack events,  where a hacker stuffs in some sort of false code(fraudulent messages) aiming at either  tricking the source contract to deliver false messages to the destination chain OR by directly tricking the destination chain to automate messages that aren't from the source code.\n\n[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) has always proven to be ahead of the emerging risks with the advent of “stop the hack\" protocol known as **[Pre-crime](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/introducing-pre-crime-49bef4a581d5?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------)**.\n\n## Introducing Pre-crime\n\nTransport layers are really innocent of the exploits, as most of the catastrophes are smart contract related and has nothing to do with transport layer. Yet these transport layers deliver the final fatality.\n\nEnd of worries, with the launch ***Pre-crime*** we could prevent the final blow from being delivered.\n\nPre-Crime initiates the ability for a relayer to stop a hack before it happens.      This is achieved by forking the destination blockchain before delivering the message and running the transaction locally.                                                                                  Pre-Crime also involves the authentication to check the state of the blockchain in relation to the other connected blockchains to confirm no malicious action occurred.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Hb5TBC01De7O_m0ho9pvb.png?height=352&width=704)\n\nYou can read more about the additional layer of security : **[Pre-crime](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/introducing-pre-crime-49bef4a581d5)**.\n\nThis is just one of many steps LayerZero is taking to ensure the security of the omnichain future.\n\nThe ultimate goal of Stargate is to mitigate the risks of cross-chain swaps to the barest minimum.\n\nIn pursuit of this ultimate goal, several other sub-goals have been attained such as : Optimized volume and fees for swaps, transfers and LP.                                             **$STG**, the omnichain fungible token is the rocket science behind all these.\n\n## What’s Next\n\nThere's a lot going on, such as the Pre-crime, DEX integrations etc.\n\nThe Stargate team also cares about the community and the growth of Stargate protocol. That's why DAO governance is in place. It is vital to bring all forces together to build a strong protocol.\n\nTo ensure the efficacy of the governance, the community decided to use the Common wealth platform as the Forum that Stargate will be using for Proposals and Governance.\n\nBright minds can now come together, discuss and draft proposals.

{"id": "p5xFvBsjpweHXiWKo6oslUXKdvW0LcVbXiBXehB1Fyo", "title": "祛病延年十六妙诀 ", "body": "十六妙诀谱文  \n\n  \n\n水潮除后患，火起得长安。梦失封金匮，形衰守玉关。鼓呵消积聚，兜礼治伤寒。叩齿牙无疾，升观鬓不斑。运睛除眼翳，掩耳去头旋。托踏应轻骨，搓涂自美颜。闭摩通滞气，凝抱固丹田。淡食能多补，无心得大还。 \n\n \n\n释解  \n\n  \n\n一、水潮除后患  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n津液频生在舌端，寻常漱咽下丹田，  \n\n于中畅笑无凝滞，百日功灵可驻颜。  \n\n \n\n平明睡起时，即起端坐，凝神息虑，舌抵上 ，闭口调息，津液自生，渐至满口，分作三次，以意送下。久行之则五脏之邪火不炎，四肢之气血流畅，诸疾不生，久除后患，老而不衰。 \n\n \n\n功法：每日清晨睡醒后，即可盘膝端坐于床上，凝神定气，心无所虑，舌尖轻抵上腭，收腹提肛，闭口调息，口中津液自然产生，等到津液满口后，鼓漱三十六次，分三次慢慢吞咽，随着呼气，用意念送至小腹部丹田处。每次下咽须汩汩有声，如此，每日清晨练习三遍，即可从事其它事宜。  \n\n作用：此套功法发展甚多，并被许多养生功法所吸纳，如流传的“吞津功”，如能长期坚持研练，则五脏之火不能上炎，四肢的气血流畅无阻，不生疾病；并且精力旺盛，容颜润泽，虽年老也不会感到体力衰弱。  \n\n  \n\n二、火起得长安  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n阳火须知自下生，阴符上降落黄庭，  \n\n周流不息精神固，此是真人大炼形。 \n\n  \n\n子午二时，存想真火自涌泉穴起，先从左足行，上玉枕，过泥丸，降入丹田。三遍。次从右足，亦行三遍。复从尾闾起，又行三遍。久久纯熟，则百脉流通，五脏无滞，四肢健而百骸理也。 \n\n \n\n功法：每日夜半子时和中午午时，在床上盘膝端坐 (如在其它地方得有垫子)，意想真火从脚底涌泉穴内生。意念此火先从左脚底涌泉穴内起，经左大腿内后侧上行督脉，至脑后玉枕穴，再过泥丸(百会穴)，经任脉降人腹部丹田内，如此运行三遍；再用意念此火由右脚底涌泉穴内起，依上述运行路线运行三遍；最后存想真火从尾间内生，沿督脉上升，复由任脉下行至腹部丹田。如此亦运行三遍，意守丹田穴5—10分钟后，再缓缓收功。  \n\n作用：此套功法后来道家修行者将其演化为“青松不老功”。坚持长期研练，则百脉通畅，五脏无滞碍，四肢健壮，内气充盈，而百骸安宁，自可精神百倍，长久安康了。  \n\n  \n\n三、梦失封金匮  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n精滑神疲欲火攻，梦中遗失致伤生，  \n\n搓摩有诀君须记，绝欲除贪是上乘。  \n\n \n\n欲动则火炽，火炽则神疲，神疲则精滑而梦失也。寤寐时，调息神思，以左手搓脐二七，右手亦然。 \n\n复以两手搓胁，摆摇七七．咽气纳于丹田，握固良久乃止，屈足侧卧，永无走失。 \n\n \n\n功法：卧床未睡之时，先仰卧，调息定神，心无所虑。将两手掌心相对合，双手如洗手状相互搓摩至极热时，先用左手掌心搓脐十四次，然后再换右手搓脐十四次；待搓脐完后，再用两手搓摩两胁及左右腹部各十四次；最后两手交叉把定双肩摇摆七次；然后双手握固咽气人丹田，握固良久后即可停止。入睡时，从身体右侧卧，屈右腿仲左腿，右手掌心掩于右耳下，左手掌心朝下自然放于左大腿上，调匀呼吸，此即右侧睡法。  \n\n作用：此套功法可防止遗精，特别是因劳顿疲倦所致梦遗者。修真之士特别注重此功法，如郑思远真人曰：事多忘者神昏，汗多出者神脱。此是梦失神弱，脱漏真精，乃修真之士之大忌也。如能长期坚持研练，白可精神内固，神气内敛，生精益气壮筋骨，则梦遗精滑之症不治自愈也。  \n\n  \n\n四、形衰守玉关  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n却老扶衰别有方，不须身外觅阴阳，  \n\n玉关谨守常渊默，气足神全寿自康。  \n\n \n\n百虑感中，万事劳形。所以衰也。返老还童，非金丹不可。然金丹岂易得哉？善摄生者，行住坐卧，一意不散，固守丹田，默运神气，冲透三关，自然生精生气，则形可以壮，老可以耐矣。 \n\n \n\n功法：在日常生活中，无论行走坐卧，一有闲暇，即应敛神止虑，调息定气，意念不散，固守丹田，默运神气，冲透三关，运转小周天循环，自然产生精气。  \n\n作用：思虑伤心，琐事劳形，这是衰老的根本原因。要想返老还童，没有长生金丹不行，可金丹世上难以找寻，故善于养生者，金丹自在体内寻找。意守丹田，自可内气充盈，气血运转畅通，肢体康健，可享长寿。  \n\n  \n\n五、鼓呵消积聚  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n气滞脾虚食不消，腹中膨闷最唯调，  \n\n徐徐呵鼓潜通泰，疾退身安莫久劳。  \n\n \n\n有因食而积者，有因气而积者，久则脾胃受伤，医药难治。孰若节饮食，戒嗔怒，不使有积聚为妙？患者当正身闭息，鼓动胸腹，俟其气满，缓缓呵出。如此行五七次，便得通快即止。 \n\n \n\n功法：凡有胸腹部积聚之病，宜盘胨端坐，先以鼻吸气，鼓动有病的胸腹部，等到气满后，再张口慢慢地呵出，如此鼻吸口呵连做七次，觉身体舒畅后即可停止。此功法可反复行之，有病治病，无病防病，惟无病时，可意念将胸腹中的郁闷之气徐徐呵出即可。  \n\n作用：此套功法源自道家的“吐纳术”，据传道家龙门派第六代“真”字辈傅山先生所传授的“火龙功”，专门对症治疗身体某一部分疾病，可惜失传久矣。常人有因饮食而成积聚，有因气滞而成积聚，时间一长自然脾胃受损，中气不足，饮食难以消化，坚持研练此功，自可消除此疾。 \n\n \n\n六：兜礼治伤寒  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n跏趺端坐向蒲团，手握阴囊气要专。  \n\n运气叩头三五遍，顿令寒疾立时安。  \n\n \n\n元气亏弱，腠理不密，则风寒伤感。患者端坐盘足，以两手紧兜外肾，闭口缄息。存想真气自尾闾升，过夹脊，透泥丸，逐其邪气，低头屈抑如礼拜状，不拘数，以汗出为度，其疾即愈。 \n\n \n\n功法：盘膝端坐，两手兜住睾丸向上轻轻托起，闭口缄息，凝神调气，浑身放松，意念真气从尾闾处上行，沿督脉经循行，过夹脊，透过泥丸，将邪气逐出；如此运行三遍，然后低头屈身前俯，如礼拜叩首一样，不限次数，以汗出为度；亦可双手双臂前伸，身体前俯，不限次数，以汗出为度。此时所出汗液，不可让其自行回落，用干毛巾将其擦干即可。 \n\n作用：此套功法道家、佛家最后发展成“捻裆功”或“铁裆功”等，以增强生殖机能，保精保元，是为修真秘传功法。长期坚持研练此套功法，可壮元阳，益精气，密腠理，身体强健，外邪不侵，自无伤寒之疾。  \n\n  \n\n七、叩齿牙无疾  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n热极风生齿不宁，清晨叩漱自惺惺，  \n\n若教运用常无隔，还许它年老复丁。  \n\n \n\n齿之有疾，乃脾胃之火薰蒸。每侵晨睡醒时，叩齿三十六遍。以舌搅牙龈之上，不论遍数。 \n\n津液满口，方可咽下。每作三次乃止。凡小解之时，闭口切牙，解毕方开，永无齿疾。 \n\n \n\n \n\n功法：每日清晨睡醒后，盘膝端坐，两手握固放于左右大腿上，即叩齿三十六次；然后以舌搅牙龈上方数次，待口中津液满后，可鼓漱三十六遍，然后分三次缓缓咽下，咽下时须汩汩声响，直人腹中丹田。此功闲暇时亦可行之，凡解大小便，均可闭口咬牙，解完后稍待开口，则永无牙疾之患。此亦形意门秘传要诀。  \n\n作用：肾主骨，齿乃骨之余，人的衰老多由齿始，且齿的康健与否直接关乎肾脏的调节。修行家认为肾乃产精之源，惜精如命，故此功被修真之士定为每日必修功课。牙疾虽由多种原因引起，但只要坚持研练此套功法，自可永无牙疾之患，且可在不知不觉中精满神足元气壮，身体强健，可登寿域。  \n\n  \n\n八：升观鬓不斑  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n神气冲和精自全，存无守有养胎仙，  \n\n心中念虑皆消灭，要学神仙也不难。  \n\n \n\n思虑太过则神耗、气虚，血败而鬓班矣。要以子午时，握固端坐，凝神绝念，两眼令光，上视泥丸。存想追摄二气自尾闾间上升，下降返还元海，每行九遍。久则神全，气血充足，发可返黑也。 \n\n \n\n功法：在每日的夜牛子时和中午午时，盘膝端坐，两手握固放于大腿上，凝神止虑，调匀气息，两眼微闭，神光上视泥丸，意想追摄阴阳二气，息尾闾会阴穴沿督脉经循行上升，复沿任脉经降至喉咙，下人气海返归丹田，如此每次练习九遍收功。  \n\n作用：思虑太过，神耗气弱，血衰则头发斑白，而斑白发一般均先从鬓角开始。故长期坚持研练此套功法，可神全精足，气血旺盛，经脉通畅，毛发滋润，自可乌发而不斑白矣。此法高血压患者不宜练习。  \n\n  \n\n九、运睛除眼病  \n\n  \n\n伤热伤气，肝虚肾虚、则眼昏生翳，日久不治，盲瞎必矣。每日睡起时，趺坐凝思，塞兑垂帘，将双目轮转十四次，紧闭少时，忽然大瞪。行久不替，内障外翳自散，切忌色欲，并书细字。 \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n喜怒伤神目不清，垂帘塞兑养元精，  \n\n精生气化神来复，五内阴魔自失惊。 \n\n \n\n功法：每日清晨起床时，先盘膝端坐，凝神止虑，调息收心，闭口垂睑，塞耳息听，双目转动如轮，左右各十四次，顺逆旋转各一遍，紧闭一会双眼，然后突然睁大眼睛，如此数遍。  \n\n作用：肝开窍于目，目乃一身精华所聚，且与五脏六腑紧密相系。若被热、气等所伤，则眼睛容易昏花，生伤，时间一长则易失明，并能直接影响五脏六腑机能的正常运转。如能长期研练此功法，则内障外翳自然消散，眼睛明亮，神气逼人。此功忌色欲和看、写小字。  \n\n  \n\n十：掩耳去头旋  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n视听无闻意在心，神从髓海逐邪氛，  \n\n更兼精气无虚耗，可学蓬莱境上人。  \n\n \n\n邪风入脑，虚火上攻，则头目昏旋，偏正作痛。久则中风不语，半身不遂，亦由此致。治之，须静坐，升身闭息。以两手掩耳折头五七次。存想元神逆上泥丸，以逐其邪，自然风邪散去。 \n\n \n\n功法：盘膝端坐正身，收心闭息，用两手掌心掩耳昂头、低头五至七次，然后再摇头数次，意想元神逆上泥丸，逐去风邪，便觉脑中清彻宁静，一片祥和。  \n\n作用：邪风人脑，虚火上攻，则导致头目昏眩，及偏正头痛；时间久了则会导致中风不语、半身不遂等症。如能长期研练此功法，可使心肾相交，水火相济，降火逐邪，去风清神，疾病自治矣。  \n\n  \n\n十一：托踏应轻骨  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n精气冲和五脏安，四肢完固骨强坚，  \n\n虽然未得刀圭饵，且住人间做地仙。  \n\n \n\n四肢亦欲得小劳，譬如户枢终不朽，熊鸟演法，吐纳导引，皆养生之术也。平时双手上托，如举大石，两脚前踏，如覆平地，存想神气，根据按四时嘘呵二七次。则身轻体健，足耐寒暑。 \n\n \n\n功法：在日常生活中，闲暇之时，先双手上托，凭空用力，如举大石千斤，两脚前踏，如履平地，凭空承重，如负巨物；然后按四时，行六字诀，并存思吐出体内邪气。即春嘘、夏呵、秋呬、冬吹、三焦嘻、四季长呼各十四次。  \n\n作用：流水不腐，户枢不蠹，五禽戏、八段锦、吐纳导引之术皆养生之法。只要平日坚持研练，自能身轻体健，四肢灵活，精气冲和，五脏安康，延年益寿。  \n\n  \n\n十二：搓涂自美颜  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n欲寡心虚气自盈，自然五脏得和平，  \n\n衰颜仗此增光泽，不羡人间五等荣。  \n\n \n\n颜色憔悴，所由心思过度，劳碌不谨。每晨静坐闭目，凝神存养，神气冲澹，自内达外。以两手搓热，拂面七次。仍以嗽津涂面，搓拂数次。行之半月，则皮肤光润，容颜悦泽，大过寻常矣。 \n\n \n\n功法：每日清晨醒后，先盘膝闭目静坐，凝神调息意养神气平和充盈，精华自内而外，荣达于面部；然后将两手掌心相对，相互如洗手状搓热，以两掌心摩面七次；再用口中鼓漱之津液涂面，搓摩数十次即可。  \n\n作用：面容憔悴，是山思虑过度，劳碌不慎引起的。如能坚持研练这套功法，半月之后，白可皮肤光泽明亮，不同寻常。而今社会这霜那露皆化学制剂，哪如此等养颜美容之妙。  \n\n  \n\n十三：闭摩通滞气  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n荣卫流行不暂休，一才凝滞便堪忧，  \n\n谁知闭息能通畅，此外何须别计求。  \n\n \n\n气滞则痛，血滞则肿，滞之为患，不可不慎。治之，须澄心闭息，以左手摩滞七七遍，右手亦然，复以津涂之。勤行七日，则气血通畅，永无凝滞之患。修养家所谓干沐浴者，即此义也。 \n\n \n\n功法：在日常生活中，闲暇之时，盘膝静坐，凝神止虑，清心闭息，意念注于患处，先用左手搓摩患处四十九次，再用右手亦搓摩患处四十九次；然后再用津液涂患处五至七次；四肢躯干均可用此法搓摩，修真之士称之为干沐浴。  \n\n作用：气滞则痛，血滞则肿，气血阻滞，百病从生。此套功法不止散气消肿，无病行之，上下闭息，经络通畅，气血流行，肌肤光莹，乃养生之道也。如能长期研练，则永无疑痛肿疼之苦，不需寻医问药了。  \n\n  \n\n十四：凝抱固丹田  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n丹田完固气归根，气聚神凝道合真，  \n\n久视定须从此始，莫教虚度好光阴。  \n\n \n\n元神一出便收来，神返身中气自回。如此朝朝并暮暮，自然赤子产真胎。此凝抱之功也。平时静坐，存想元神入于丹田，随意呼吸。旬日，丹田完固；百日，灵明渐通。不可或作或辍也。 \n\n \n\n功法：在日常生活中，闲暇之时，盘膝静坐，意想元神进人丹田，然后意念随丹田开合而呼吸，十数天后丹田充实，百日后则灵通渐明，勤行不辍，功不间断，自有奇效。  \n\n作用：此套功法乃道家秘传“百日筑基功”，静中寓动，阴阳相合之意，凝神意守丹田如鸡孵卵，使丹田有充固真气之效，它与道外流行不同，故诗曰：“元神一出便收来，神返身中气自回；如此朝朝并暮暮，自然赤子产真胎。”  \n\n  \n\n十五：淡食能多补  \n\n  \n\n谱诀： \n\n厚味伤人无所知，能甘淡薄是吾师，  \n\n三千功行从此始，天鉴行藏信有之。  \n\n \n\n五味之于五脏，各有所宜。若食之不节，必至亏损。孰若食淡谨节之为愈也？然此淡亦非弃绝五味，特言欲五味之冲淡耳。仙翁有云∶断盐不是道，饮食无滋味。可见其不绝五味，淡对浓而言，若膏粱过度之类如吃素是也。 \n\n \n\n说明：此功即教人节食鸡鸭伍肉，煎炸烹烤肥厚美味，提倡五谷杂粮，瓜果蔬菜调和搭配。且肥厚生浊，淡食化清，补精益气。故古人曰：是故谨和五味，竹正筋柔，气血以流，胺理以密，如是则骨气以精。谨道如法，长有天命。  \n\n  \n\n十六：无心得大还  \n\n \n\n谱诀： \n\n有作有为云至要，无声无嗅语方奇，  \n\n中秋午夜通消息，明月当空造化基。  \n\n \n\n大还之道，圣道也。无心者，常清常静也。人能常清静，天地悉皆归。何圣道之不可传，大还之不可得哉！《清静经》已备言之矣。修真之士，体而行之。欲造夫清真灵妙之境，若反掌耳。 \n\n \n\n说明：修真之士应以清心为本，参天地日月造化，保持清静，身体力行，妙悟玄机，可得大还之道，自可返老还童，可登寿域矣。 \n\n ",

One such collective, appropriately titled BFF, has made some noteworthy progress in the space. Only a few months old, the community has over more than 50,000 members in its space which includes some women celebrities including, Mila Kunis, Gwyneth Paltrow, Paris Hilton and Tyra Banks.\n\nAnother collective that has made some splash known as the,  Black Women Blockchain Council, to onboard more black women into web3. This community has been around since 2018. Some others such as WomenRise, Boss Beauties, Crypto Chicks are also currently ruling the roost in the NFT space. To be honest, this is just the tip of the iceberg and a lot more needs to be done.\n\n**How do we get there?**\n\nWe can’t iterate this enough but education is the stepping stone to everything. If we want real life adoption, we have to understand that correct awareness is the prerequisite to that. Supporting and educating women, before aiming to onboard them into web3 is the chief requirement\n\nA few startups are already working towards that. One of the most notable ones include, Unstoppable Domains, that launched $10M Women of web3 initiative. To do so, they have tied up with nearly 65 initiatives to make this program a reality.\n\nAdditionally, our project, [Girl With Secrets](https://twitter.com/gwsofficialNFT) is working towards creating an ecosystem where women feel comfortable about seeking careers in crypto. We aim to create a program where women will be given the first preference when they seek out education and internship opportunities and our NFT collection has been curated to further that purpose.\n\n![She is coming for you...stay on guard ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aiyTdWVHAnSbE-0UdG52W.png?height=4096&width=3067)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, education is the prerequisite to every act of adoption. Until people are made aware of the possibilities, they would not know which option is their best choice. Girl With Secrets will work towards presenting that choice to women who have until now, haven’t been able to find their way into web3.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n### How can you reach us?\n\n**Twitter**: @gwsofficialNFT\n\n**Discord**: [https://discord.gg/KHe9YyjDmz ](https://discord.gg/KHe9YyjDmz)\n\n**Instagram**:<https://www.instagram.com/gwsofficialnft/>\n\n**Telegram**: <https://t.me/+K89a-DsFOkY5ODY0>\n\n**Whatsapp**: <https://chat.whatsapp.com/GUCTg7VPOoNGXBh5S5Y5TK>\n\n**Facebook**: <https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100080914332795&sk=about>\n\n**Reddit**: <https://www.reddit.com/user/gwsofficialnft>\n\n**Quora**: <https://www.quora.com/profile/Marketing-GWS>\n\n**TikTok**: <https://www.tiktok.com/@gwsofficial.nft?lang=en>", "timestamp": 1653376782, "digest": "bHrW2wXVzkOO1Ko1191hK65tL0MkOgJUEkGOtthzUe8", "contributor": "0x6E2aE861d64d8E56E6438731b52920c9CBB430Cc"}
{"id": "YS03f-CaGGnG2w-zpnFo2UvhuEZNmSBMewhSuGXEGNk", "title": "What is an iNFT?", "body": "To better understand this, we need to understand the fundamental problem of the Internet.\nAlthough the Internet was a great invention and changed the lifestyles of many people, this influential invention has a fundamental problem, and that is the domination of governments or corporations on it; with the advent of the Internet, p2p transactions are gone and there will always be an intermediary, who gets a large share of the transactions, however, the people who produce the content or coding, have a small portion, and most of the profits belongs to these intermediaries, who are often government or government-affiliated entities.\n\nToday, blockchains, which are known as the internet of value, have made a difference in recent years, as has the Internet.\nOne of the achievements of blockchain is NFT, which is gaining people's attention every day as it grows.\nIn newer cases, these NFTs have been integrated with artificial intelligence, which raises concerns.\nCritics believe that just as the Internet is run by certain people, these NFTs equipped with artificial intelligence may also become autonomous and rebellious.\n\nEven if you don't want to, in the near future all NFTs will have artificial intelligence, capable of making sense, and possibly intelligence, on a human level in the coming decades.\niNFTs are generated in the form of an intelligent coding contract that is unchangeable.\nThe produced iNFT is not only remarkably intelligent but also has the capabilities of perception and animation.\nThese NFTs constantly learn, either through their owner or through searching the internet.\niNFT basically increases the value of NFTs by 100 times. They are smart, scalable, productive, and aware, and the Alethea AI protocol is the interface between these NFTs and the data access network.\n\n•\tThings we may see in the future by using this protocol and artificial intelligence include:\n\n* Rap battle between Cryptopunk on Twitch platform:\n  A Cryptopunk can talk to you soon and rap against another Cryptopunk in Rap battle, which is watched by millions of people.\n* Shortly, you will have two-way experiences with your NFT, and you may laugh at jokes or get inspired by each other.\n* Digital agriculture:\n  Depending on the type of land you have in the world of Metaverse, this farmer reminds you to cultivate your land.\n* Shortly, only those who are the Holders of that project will have the right to vote in the decisions of that Meta-world as citizens.\n\nGiven the Alethea AI protocol, all you need to do is code, to create a smart NFT for yourself.\nWhile the risks of centralization are high, due to its dependence on the OpenAI model, there are new open source projects which eliminate this concern.\n\nWhen man first split the atom, the result was the creation of tremendous energy that could be used for constructive or destructive purposes.\nSimilarly, we can now enter the designing space with infinite depth and dimensions, which allows us to turn NFT into a smart, irreplaceable asset, or use it to destroy ourselves.\n\n## Concluding remarks:\n\"Like the tools of the present world that satisfy our material desires, iNFTs enhance our spirituality. In general, INFTs lead us to a different technical and moral dimension.\nSmart NFTs may one day revive our ancestors' language structures, or invent new things.\"", "timestamp": 1653376864, "digest": "eoT1bLHhQdAh6-3VZz1WuqknOdjr6xnCGQihaZ7YkpE", "contributor": "0xfb136ba1A47dB63cE180B5Bb8ea0A0aFFcB8925e"}

{"id": "ymhOcOUYLg_OseKrBmmrKUwyML7KbVcTNpusWGRkN50", "title": "从货币政策角度，对Terra崩盘及稳定币设计的思考", "body": "每个人都想成为美联储，通过发行货币向全世界征用取铸币税，超发货币照成的通胀有全世界一同买单。Terra 曾被冠以算法稳定币界美联储的称号，最终的结果确是 Luna 和 UST 总共 400 多亿的市值在几天时间内蒸发，让人唏嘘不已。本文从货币政策的角度出发，探讨 Terra 崩盘的本质原因和新公链稳定币设计方案。\n\n## 1. Terra 简介\n\n鉴于 USDT、USDC 等中心化稳定币背后的抵押物不透明，DAI、MIM 等利用超额抵押铸造出来的去中心化稳定币资金利用率低，Terra 提出了一种全新的算法稳定币机制。已经很多优秀的文章详细得介绍了 Terra，本文主要从货币的角度对算稳进行思考，因此不对 Terra 做过多的描述。简单来说 Terra 就是一系列法币稳定币，通过算法来实现稳定币和法币价格的锚定。其中流通量交易量最大的是 UST，因此本文后面的关于 Terra 的稳定币专指 UST。Terra 稳定币实现锚定的套利机制如下：\n\nTerra系统采用双代币机制，即Luna和UST，Luna价格可以自由波动，UST锚定美元。Luna用于吸收UST的波动。假设目前 1 Luna = 100 U：\n\n* 当 1 UST = 1.2 U时，用户可以花 100 U 购买 1 Luna 进行销毁并铸造出 100 UST，卖出后可获得 120 U，盈利20U。随着市场上越来越多人参与套利，最终会使得 1 UST = 1 U，带来的结果是 Luna 流通量减小，价格升高，UST流通量增大，价格降低，表现为稳定币的扩张。\n* 当 1 UST = 0.8 U时，用户可以花 100 U 购买 125 UST 进行销毁，并铸造出 1.25 Luna，卖出后可获得 125 U，盈利 25 U 。随着市场上越来越多人参与套利，最终会使得 1 UST = 1 U，带来的结果是 Luna 流通量增大，价格降低，UST流通量减小，价格升高，表现为稳定币的收紧。\n\n![Terra 套利机制](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J74lpDNDJ05qaL54lr0Yk.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n## 崩盘事件回顾\n\n### 2.1 前提\n\n5\\.7号崩盘前夕，UST总市值为18.7B，逼近Luna的23.4B的市值，整个Terra生态杠杆率过高是狙击UST 成功的前提。\n\n![UST 与 Luna 市值， 来源: Footprint](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ndtWqEy2uAGe2fuR86rAp.png?height=384&width=899)\n\n### 2.2 时机\n\n为了增加 Curve 4 pool（UST - USDT - USDC - Frax）流动性，以排挤竞争对手 DAI，Terra 团队从 Curve UST-3Crv（USDT - USDC - DAI）中移除 [1.5 亿 UST 流动性](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x18bd477f9beeff22b2ad0c6d48a9c0f02b542049789f0638f5ec50365f1d1de7)，准备往 4pool 转移。给做空者留下了低成本攻击 UST - 3Crv的机会。\n\n![从UST - 3CRV 中撤池并转换成 1.5 亿 UST，来源：Etherscan.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IC_KUZcy9JpfOupxZNUDj.png?height=399&width=1161)\n\n### 2.3 行动\n\n随后，[85 M](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xaa23df48c53f221d0e8ac60ffc9e69340f3e8948fcdc936f3aee9c887d802abb) 的 UST转到 Curve 中砸掉换成 USDC，随后，大量地址加入UST砸盘大军，[UST-3Crv LP严重失衡](https://dune.com/queries/684097/1268954)，引发 UST 脱钩警戒线。\n\n![85 M UST 转入 Curve 进行砸盘， 来源：Etherscan.io](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/30qwUV82W-Fq-5cEhhPYe.png?height=436&width=1144)\n\n![UST - 3Crv比例失衡，来源： DuneAnalysis(@mhonkasalo)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/h0Kju89-xExywqex3vIxI.png?height=540&width=1474)\n\n### 2.4 防守\n\n为了使 UST - 3Crv 池子保持平衡，把 UST 重新锚定，团队兵分两路，[卖掉了 5万多个 ETH 到 Curve去护盘，转了 2万个ETH到币安去护盘](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x6b671b51258db0316dd89bc0075d6113488be5e8)，使得 Curve 中的 UST- 3Crv 重新达到平衡。由于团队的ETH大部分委托给了 Lido 参与 ETH2.0 Staking，所以有大量 ETH 是通过 stETH 兑换而来的，随后引发市场对 stETH 脱钩的担忧。\n\n![stETH - ETH 受到冲击，来源：Dune Analysis(@LidoAnalytical)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YyR-i09qKyQdOWNhJ294p.png?height=549&width=1697)\n\n### 2.5 破防\n\n资金来回较量好几回，Terra 团队将资金消耗大半，大量的 UST 是从 Anchor 中赎回，由于 Anc 赎回 UST 无需锁定期，无法给团队缓冲器，大量UST从Anc赎回，砸向市场，导致UST进一步脱钩，并且 UST 脱钩推动套利者将 UST 销毁铸造成 Luna 砸向市场，导致 Luna 的价格开始暴跌。由于每天可以低价差用UST去铸造Luna的数量有限，超过一定限额后，兑换价差将会增大，使得套利者减少。因此 UST 脱钩的程度与套利价差有关。当套利价差出现时，难以通过套利者套利使 UST 回归正常水平，UST 脱钩时间太长，进一步照成 UST 信用损失，更多的 UST 会砸向市场和铸造成 Luna 砸向市场。当 Luna 市值小于 UST 时，进一步引发信任危机，引发挤兑，开启死亡螺旋。\n\n## 3. 从货币角度分析 Terra 崩盘的本质原因\n\n### 3.1 UST 使用场景失调，资金在借贷市场空转\n\n一国货币的使用场景对内有的消费、投资和储蓄，以促进内部经济循环，对外有消费和投资，将系统内部的通胀对外输出。把每条公链比作一个国家，公链中的稳定币也应满足以上五种使用场景。\n\n对内：\n\n* 消费：用稳定币购买生态中生产的商品，如购买NFT和在Gamefi中的氪金；\n* 投资：用稳定币进行生态内投资，如参与 IDO 和在去中心化交易所（DEX）交易；\n* 储蓄：将稳定币存入到借贷协议中赚取利息；\n\n对外：\n\n* 消费：使用稳定币购买生态以外的消费品；\n* 投资：通过跨链，使用稳定币购买生态之外的标的；\n\n看看Terra在这五个方面做的努力：\n\n对内：\n\n* 消费：Terra生态中有少量关于NFT和游戏的项目满足用户消费需求；\n* 投资：Mirror是Terra生态中的重要投资场所，提供了美股合成资产交易；\n* 储蓄：Anchor在Terra生态中起到积累储蓄的作用。\n\n对外：\n\n* 消费：与各种支付平台合作，如Chai、Astral等，用户可以在使用Terra稳定币购买链下的商品；\n* 投资：通过跨链桥，用户可以去到其他公链上进行投资消费；UST上架Binance、FTX等头部交易所，用户可以用UST去购买其他投资标的\n\n其中链下购买商品和上架主流交易所是 UST 最大的亮点，为其在稳定币竞争中建立强大的壁垒。\n\n![Terra 生态，来源：Twitter @Terraians_](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B54wTwECI_TTp_7k0EED6.png?height=692&width=1227)\n\n从五种场景的结构来看，在崩盘前夕，UST总发行量为 [18.7B](https://terra.smartstake.io/history)，其中储蓄在 Anchor 中的UST为 [14B](https://app.anchorprotocol.com/#/)，有 75% 的 UST 使用于储蓄。表明其他四种使用场景推进困难，导致整个生态储蓄率过高，整个货币流通结构极度失衡。因此，Anchor 是推动 Terra 生态崩盘的罪魁祸首。\n\n![UST供应量，来源：Terra Analytics](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HeVhpq_k607FuCsnow0RW.png?height=566&width=905)\n\n![存在Anchor中的UST数量，来源：Anchor](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rt1CtRQCmshKNaiXz7DnN.png?height=648&width=1626)\n\n由于 Defi 市场的 APY 波动较大，因此 Anchor 推出了 20% 的固定存款利率。同时为了激励用户进行借款，给予贷款用户补贴，使其可以负利率借款。当整体 Defi 市场的存款利率下降时，Anchor 也没有及时调低存款利率和取消贷款补贴，贷款方借出 UST 后没有更好的地方可以去，只好存入Anchor中，**资金在整个存贷系统中空转，进一步得提高了Terra生态的杠杆率**，直到UST的市值逼近Luna。高的货币发行量并没有带来低利率和高投资效应，资金没有流向生态的其他应用场景，对应的现实中，当高的社会融资规模，并没有带来经济的增长的时候，资金在金融系统中空转，会使整体系统性风险提高。\n\n### 3.2 传导机制受阻，无法自发调节货币供应量\n\n固定汇率制，资本自由流动，货币政策的独立性是经济学中经典的三元悖论，取其中两个，必然需要放弃第三个。**算稳的首要目标是锚定汇率，同时公链之间通过跨链桥自由流动，相当于一国采用采取了资本自由流通下的固定汇率制，必然会丧失掉对货币政策的独立性。**\n\n![货币政策的三个不可能](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NmmCcUgGZiDRyjDYGyrEp.png?height=477&width=624)\n\nTerra 通过 Anchor 强行控制存款利率，在 Terra 超发货币的时候，利率调节受阻，无法通过传导机制自发调节减少货币供应量，最终影响货币政策目标的实现。实际上，团队作为 Luna 最大的持有人，是最有激励去做超发货币的操作，一方面可以使得 Luna 进一步通缩快速拉升其市值，另一方面，用高息债券作为超发货币的蓄水池，以此提升协议整体 TVL，来提高 Luna的整体估值。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5tcQIuSoFhmUSrDU1rkjx.png?height=111&width=994)\n\n### 3.3 流动性缺失加速死亡螺旋\n\nTerra 生态中，UST 相当于是面值为 1 的可转债，Luna 相当于股权。从传导机制上看，Luna 只用于吸收 UST 的波动，Luna的价格变动并会不导致 UST 脱钩。Luna 并不是 UST 储备金的体现，而是债务流动性的体现。流动性是指资产变现不受损失的能力，**UST 的流动性为 UST 二级市场的变现能力以及 Luna 的变现能力的最大值。**二级市场变现能力主要在 Curve 和交易所中。**当 UST 脱钩的时，UST 流动性减弱，需要依赖Luna 的流动性。**持币人将 UST 转换为 Luna 进行变现，当 Luna 市值低于 UST 市值时，说明 Luna 的流动性不足以偿还 UST 的债务，UST 债务变现必然遭受损失。\n\n当 Terra 显著违约时，需要进行缩表和扩充资产端。团队将手中存量的 UST 或者折价回购的 UST 债务转换为 Luna 完成债转股，并将 Luna 砸向市场，完成缩表和扩充资产端。不断增发的 Luna 导致整个 Terra 网络不完全，容易产生治理攻击，使 Luna 失去了公链价值，进一步降低 Luna 的估值。\n\n## 4. 新公链稳定币的设计思考\n\n新兴市场国家往往因为货币政策使用不当，引发新兴市场风险。近几年越来越多的新公链崛起，新公链就像是一个个新兴市场国家，其稳定币设计是最容易积累系统性风险的环节，为了避免一个稳定币协议拖垮整条公链的情况，提出以下两点新公链稳定币的设计思考。\n\n### 4.1 下放铸币权\n\n正如每届总统都会想在自己任免期间采取扩张的政策以拉动经济，因此要保证货币政策的制定不受政府的影响。公链团队有很大激励去做货币超发，但是在固定汇率和资本自由流动下，无法实现货币超发，因此团队会做一些干预来使得整个货币传导机制不通畅，给公链积累系统性风险。因此需要将铸币权下方，生态中多种算稳协议共同竞争，以减少稳定币协议崩盘给整条公链生态带来的冲击。无法使用扩张的货币政策，转而采用扩张的财政政策，如生态基金奖励项目方（搞基建）、降低 Gas（降低税收）、给深度用户发空投（提高居民福利水平）等，扩张的财政政策对整个生态的经济建设和用户会更好一些。\n\n### 4.2 降低稳定币协议风险与新公链代币的相关性\n\n为了避免稳定币崩盘带来的死亡螺旋效应，新公链的稳定币协议，应该减少使用新公链代币做为储备，以降低协议风险和公链风险的相关性，从而避免死亡螺旋。用新公链代币做抵押储备资产发行的稳定币，当稳定币脱钩时，会有更多的新公链代币被赎回，并砸向市场，当稳定币在生态中占有重要地位时，容易触发稳定币协议与公链代币的死亡螺旋。\n\n## 5. 结语\n\nWeb 3 的世界每天都在快速迭代，倒下了一个 Terra，还有千千万万的 “Terra” 在算稳赛道上贡献自己的智慧。设计者和投资者应当深入研究货币政策的内核原理，避免披上算法稳定币外衣的旁氏骗局。期待在不久的将来会出现更加成熟稳定的稳定币方案。", "timestamp": 1653377258, "digest": "D2VmXUAdHg_9TcQlMl8FuiaM6-iIVXFi7q9y1JbBkqI", "contributor": "0x81Fd71e8144e44D4c767bb192013AC3f0E9e23C8"}

The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing.

Gox 受黑客攻击，平台的10万枚比特币及用户的75万枚比特币被盗，占当时比特币流通总量7%，也是目前为止金额数最大的比特币失窃案。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-G5CR-7vFJvZHsT_lXU-6.png?height=693&width=1080)\n\n2月25日，Mt. Gox 宣布关闭交易，仅仅两天，比特币价格暴跌31%。\n\n到了2015年初，比特币价格跌至200美元下。\n\n2015年2月，*The End Of Bitcoin*（比特币的终结）一文面世，文中称比特币并不具备可循环的经济体系，正在消亡的迹象之一是几乎没有人真正使用这种货币。\n\n2016年1月14日，当时颇具影响力的 Mike Hearn 宣布比特币失败，并透露他已售出所有比特币，受此消息影响，比特币价格单日下跌 10%。\n\n华盛顿邮报刊登了 *R.I.P. Bitcoin. It’s Time To Move On*（安息吧比特币，是时候继续前进了），对比特币唱起了挽歌，文章中提了中国的矿场，提及比特币社区正在内战，表示“让我们记住是什么让一些风险资本家对比特币狂热：纯粹的贪婪，这就是我最清楚比特币失败的原因。”\n\n## 03\n\n2017年，比特币走出其第一个高点。\n\n在此周期，*Bitcoin Prices Are Headed To $0.00: Peter Schiff*（彼得希夫：比特币价格将跌至0美元）一文中记载，欧洲太平洋资本首席执行官彼得希夫表示，“最终，我认为比特币真的没有价值，在市场上，它有很多价值，只要有购买，就有价值。但是当购买消失时，价值也就消失了。”\n\n希夫说，“当音乐停止时”，很多纸面利润最终会消失。\n\n这一年的9月4日，央行联合七部委全面叫停 1C0，定性 1C0 为非法融资行为，国内交易所也被关闭。\n\n这也是为当下行业中，大部分人经历的第一次冲击。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_WJXti-OV0NTN5w4SG6VB.png?height=511&width=957)\n\n94之后，还有312，不过这已经是三年之后。\n\n2020年3月12日，加密货币市场经历了惨绝人寰的24小时。\n\n2020 年 3 月 12 日下午六点半开始，比特币为首的加密货币突然开始大跳水，比特币价格从 7000 美元开始下跌，在 13 日 7 点左右，短暂稳定后的比特币再次坠落下跌，一度跌至 3800 美元，24 小时内，暴跌近 50%。\n\n据币 Coin 数据显示，“312”的 24 个小时内，全网遭遇爆仓的人数超过 10 万 人，最大单笔爆仓单发生在 Huobi，比特币价值约 5832 万美元，而全网爆仓总金额 29.3 亿美元，约合 205 亿元人民币。\n\n## 04\n\n如今看来，312 只是全球金融市场黑天鹅开始的缩影。\n\n时间调回当下，5 月 12 日，CoinGecko 数据显示，加密资产总市值现已跌至 1.23 万亿美元，24 小时跌幅 16.8%。\n\nF2pool 数据显示，随着比特币下跌至 27,000 美元上下，按照 0.4 元电费计算，包括蚂蚁 S9 全系列在内的多款矿机已到达关机币价。此外，蚂蚁 S11（关机币价 25098.80 美元）、神马 M10（关机币价 23306.03 美元）、阿瓦隆 A9（关机币价 26813.63 美元）等矿机目前已接近关机币价。\n\n持有加密货币的玩家大多经历着切肤之痛。\n\n此处可能有一个小提示，尤其在什么事情都可能发生的当下——永远不要侵吞生活的钱来用于投资，更不要借钱去投资。\n\n## 05\n\n本文只想和大家分享一下比特币，乃至加密市场发展至今遭遇的系列评价，毕竟思考一件事时，将时间轴拉长，或许能取得不一样的视角。\n\n当下的市场情绪不佳，以“加密恐惧与贪婪指数”来说，这两天数值都处于12，意味极度恐惧之时。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/U0xuhyXE-iqGW5zjd7Sh3.png?height=342&width=773)\n\n虽然“挫折使人强大”这件事儿更该感谢的是自己不是挫折，但挫折一般能帮你累积经验，同时，也能帮你分辨是否真的热爱所做之事。\n\nWeb3.0 的趋势便是让人们能够做喜欢的事儿同时获得报酬，DAO 组织也基于共同热爱。\n\n那么，这段时间也许可以思考一下，到底是如何看待这个市场，以及想如何参与（不要在夜晚做决定哦\\~），所谓 to be or not to be.\n\n## 06\n\n最后再引用一些 Bitcoin Is Dead 网站上，收录的“随机的，错误的未来预测列表”作为结尾博君一笑，永远不要让想象力和未来，死在你的前面：\n\n“高速铁路旅行是不可能的，因为无法呼吸的乘客会死于窒息。” ——爱尔兰作家 Dr. Dionysius Lardner（1830 年）\n\n“能发明的东西，都发明了。” - 美国专利局局长 Charles H. Duell (1899)\n\n“我们不喜欢他们的声音，而吉他音乐正在消失。” - 迪卡唱片公司关于不签约披头士乐队（1962）\n\n“iPhone 不可能获得任何重要的市场份额。” ——Steve Ballmer，微软首席执行官（2007 年）\n\n \n 结尾。\n\n另注：本文成文于5月12日。 \n ", "timestamp": 1653377732, "digest": "hX2vMWIEmeSQESUpkStsWQoXuH6yUYzeFtkSCsc5z5g", "contributor": "0xf042Ad30a7F1172CDa1087115638eaFAEB164454"}

Terra 简介\n\n鉴于 USDT、USDC 等中心化稳定币背后的抵押物不透明，DAI、MIM 等利用超额抵押铸造出来的去中心化稳定币资金利用率低，Terra 提出了一种全新的算法稳定币机制。已经很多优秀的文章详细得介绍了 Terra，本文主要从货币的角度对算稳进行思考，因此不对 Terra 做过多的描述。简单来说 Terra 就是一系列法币稳定币，通过算法来实现稳定币和法币价格的锚定。其中流通量交易量最大的是 UST，因此本文后面的关于 Terra 的稳定币专指 UST。Terra 稳定币实现锚定的套利机制如下：\n\nTerra系统采用双代币机制，即Luna和UST，Luna价格可以自由波动，UST锚定美元。Luna用于吸收UST的波动。假设目前 1 Luna = 100 U：\n\n* 当 1 UST = 1.2 U时，用户可以花 100 U 购买 1 Luna 进行销毁并铸造出 100 UST，卖出后可获得 120 U，盈利20U。随着市场上越来越多人参与套利，最终会使得 1 UST = 1 U，带来的结果是 Luna 流通量减小，价格升高，UST流通量增大，价格降低，表现为稳定币的扩张。\n* 当 1 UST = 0.8 U时，用户可以花 100 U 购买 125 UST 进行销毁，并铸造出 1.25 Luna，卖出后可获得 125 U，盈利 25 U 。随着市场上越来越多人参与套利，最终会使得 1 UST = 1 U，带来的结果是 Luna 流通量增大，价格降低，UST流通量减小，价格升高，表现为稳定币的收紧。\n\n![Terra 套利机制](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J74lpDNDJ05qaL54lr0Yk.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\n\n## 崩盘事件回顾\n\n### 2.1 前提\n\n5\\.7号崩盘前夕，UST总市值为18.7B，逼近Luna的23.4B的市值，整个Terra生态杠杆率过高是狙击UST 成功的前提。\n\n![UST 与 Luna 市值， 来源: Footprint](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ndtWqEy2uAGe2fuR86rAp.png?height=384&width=899)\n\n### 2.2 时机\n\n为了增加 Curve 4 pool（UST - USDT - USDC - Frax）流动性，以排挤竞争对手 DAI，Terra 团队从 Curve UST-3Crv（USDT - USDC - DAI）中移除 [1.5 亿 UST 流动性](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x18bd477f9beeff22b2ad0c6d48a9c0f02b542049789f0638f5ec50365f1d1de7)，准备往 4pool 转移。给做空者留下了低成本攻击 UST -

Yes, But Not In the Current Approach](https://medium.com/@SonorusNetwork/is-web3-the-saviour-of-the-music-industry-yes-but-not-in-the-current-approach-2cbecd45cbc9)**\n\nIn the traditional music industry, big labels decide which singers to promote and what type of songs we can discover. They usually sign singers at a very early stage, to control their music style and even their social image. That’s why many people feel music has become more commercial than artistic. Independent musicians are rising, but most of them still keep underground and are hard to be scouted.\n\n[https://youtu.be/_FRKh7VbDQo](https://youtu.be/_FRKh7VbDQo)\n\nIn the whole process, audiences are passive receivers. In the Web2 era, RSS used to be considered an approach to breaking down the monopoly of streaming services giants. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitors sites for new content, removing the need for the user to check them manually. However, RSS still requires users to be able to know where to find good music, especially those unpopular pieces, and to keep updating their subscribed lists to follow newly emerging stars. Obviously, it is not an easy task for most music listeners. Listening to music is not a must-have thing for them, but a good-to-have thing. Thus, people need solid incentives to explore music and keep listening. They need real incentives.\n\nAt the same time, the traditional music model ignores the contribution of normal listeners. Let’s consider a question. How do you find a new song and add it to your playlist? You might find a new piece from your friend’s playlist, from a random person’s personal blog, or from a party. In summary, you might find music everywhere. Music distribution is naturally a decentralized process and many distributions happen within people’s social networks instead of a centralized music promotion or recommendation project. However, 100% of advertisement payments go to those centralized music projects, and the real promoters — listeners — receive zero.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETV3iIibi1c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETV3iIibi1c)\n\nIn a word, the current music distribution system neither motivates people to find good music nor rewards those who spread music to a broader scale. However, in the Web3 era, things can be different with blockchain technology. The popular X-to-earn model can play a big role here. You are the early listener of a song? You should be rewarded for your effort to find new music! You share music on your social media and bring larger exposure? You should be rewarded for your contribution to spreading a good voice. You are willing to share your streaming data with developers to develop new DApps? You should definitely be rewarded for sharing your digital assets — data.\n\nIn the new system, each minor effort can be seen and rewarded. When listeners are more motivated to find new and possibly unpopular music and share it, more musicians would love to start creating something and try something new, and the whole music industry can thereby keep attracting the most talented and creative brains to keep it healthy and vital.\n\nWithout music-to-earn, the music industry would be dying. Trust me.\n\nSonorus is hoping to provide a complete music-to-earn model to lead this revolutionary experiment in the music industry. Sounds exciting to you?

{"id": "RSiSuYJEQIv-QDCBzrmDUwtSVWK6t4Iz0iF7HrhysNE", "title": "Crypto Scams! Don't Fall!", "body": "Past years in cryptocurrency world was full of scams. Sometimes, these scams were so  obvious that everyone knew that they are scam projects. But, most of the time the project was not that obvious and made you think “it is great to put my money in”, and puff! Your money is gone like a fur in the wind. \n\nKnowing this it is great to know some of these scams and how they work. In this little article I am going to study some these scams and tell you exactly what they are and how they work.\n\n### 1. Giveaway Scam\n\nIn this scam you are going to be promised that if you give some cryptocurrency for example 1 $BTC you will be given 2 $BTC in return. So that is a “GIVE”away scam. Usually these kinds of scams try to convince you that they are eligible, using big names like “Elon Musk”, “CZ”, “Jack Dorsey”, “Bill Gates”, etc. \n\nThey will tell you that for example, Elon Musk, is giving away some cryptocurrency like $ETH and if you send 1 $ETH to an address you will be given 2 $ETH instantly. They might even show you a page with transactions that are “happening”, which they don’t. If you go to a block explorer you can see that only the input transactions are there and no outputs. These scams usually have a timer that ticking just to rush you to send your cryptocurrency to them, without enough considering. \n\nThese scams usually happen on Twitter. But it is not limited to Twitter only. They even happen on YouTube, Instagram, etc. In the YouTube scams, there is usually a live stream of some famous person to make it eligible for you that this is them who is giving away the cryptocurrency. But the footage is stolen from somewhere else.\n\n![An example of a giveaway scam](https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/03/31/17/bitcoin%20giveaway%20elon%20musk.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp)\n\nThis kind of scam is not new and it is not special to cryptocurrencies. It started as an e-mail from a Nigerian Prince. In this e-mail it was told that if you send some amount of money, for example $1000, they will send you $10,000 right away. And they need you to send some money to confirm your bank account. \n\n### 2. Rug Pull\n\nA rug pull is a scam promotion of a cryptocurrency token via social media. After the price has been driven up, the scammer sells, and the price generally falls to zero.\n\nOne of the most famous rug pulls is the scam project, “Squid Game”. In this scam the price of the token went up during promotions and advertisements, and just in a few seconds the scammers went all in and sold all of their token and the price fell over to zero.\n\n![Squid Game token rug pull](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_771+q_lossless+ret_img+to_webp/https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Squid-Game.png)\n\nThis scam is not just for fungible token. NFTs have been sold as a rug pull too. They promise a very great roadmap and price appreciation in the coming days and after this they g to some celebrities to advertise for them. After they minted and sold all the NFTs, they delete all the website, and every other footprint of themselves and they pull the rug out and you are on yourself with a valueless NFT.\n\nAll the rug pulls are not fast and in matter of seconds. In these slow rugs the creator slowly extricates themselves from the project over a number of weeks or months. Their goal is for the buyers to eventually lose interest and abandon their hopes. Slow rug is actually a lot more common than the quicker one, and usually it is harder to zone in on.\n\n### 3. Phishing Scams\n\nThis kind of scam is such that it is so hard to spot. These scams are not exclusively related to cryptocurrencies and have existed long before to grab important details from users. Details such as bank account information, e-mail account information, etc.\n\nPhishing is a type of online scam that targets consumers by sending them an e-mail that appears to be from a well-known source – an internet service provider, a bank, or a mortgage company, for example. It asks the consumer to provide personal identifying information. Then a scammer uses the information to open new accounts, or invade the consumer’s existing accounts.\n\nThese scams started working in the cryptocurrency space when they were used by hackers to get access to people’s exchange account details and steal their funds from there. However, noticing that how secure the exchanges became recently, the phishing schemes have evolved to start targeting users directly through their cryptocurrency wallets. One of the most damaging attacks is when the hacker is able to successfully phish the private keys or seed phrases. \n\nOne of the most common ways of getting these  for the hacker is to fool user into handing over the private keys or seed phrases. These will never be requested by anyone unless you are resetting your wallet. If someone is requesting your seed phrases or private keys, they are most certainly attackers who are going to take away all your funds from your wallets. \n\nAnother way is for the hackers to give you their seed words, when you download a new wallet, a FAKE wallet! In this attack they will give you their seed words of the wallet and as soon as you deposit funds into the wallet, they will take it right away. \n\n### 4. Impersonation Scams\n\nThis scam is not specific to cryptocurrency world, too. There are several variations of this scam. In many variations of this scam, it involves a phone call from someone purporting to be a government official (e.g. a police officer, immigration officer or court official) or staff from a bank or telecommunication service provider.\n\nIn this scam, the caller might claim to be a government official, an employee or representative of a Chinese bank or courier company. The caller might claim that your identity was used to send parcels containing fake passports or weapons, or to apply for overseas credit cards. They then refer you to another caller claiming to be a Chinese official, who will ask — or even threaten — you to give them personal information such as your passport or bank account number, internet banking credentials or One-Time Password (OTP).\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, the attackers usually impersonate themselves as someone known to people. For example, Elon Musk, CZ, Coin Bureau, Jack Dorsey, etc. This attacks usually happens in Twitter but it is not limited to this application. YouTube, Instagram, Telegram, e-mail, etc. can face this kind of attack. \n\n![Impersonations of Coin Bureau](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ppieAlrpUH_6FdrtmbNtm.png?height=877&width=872)\n\nIn this scam, the attacker usually provides a face account with name and profile picture similar to the real person and tries to respond to people commenting under a post of the real account, or they go to direct messaging of the application and try to fool you that they are the real person. Sometimes the attacker has more followers than the real person using bots and fake users. \n\nBut how can we make sure that the real person is the one that we are connecting with? In almost all of the social media platforms, there is a blue (or grey) tick that shows a verification for the real person. Also, you can find the real persons username using their website or other trusted ways like another social media that you trust the real person is behind the account. \n\n### 5. Ponzi Schemes\n\nA Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors. Ponzi scheme organizers often solicit new investors by promising to invest funds in opportunities claimed to generate high returns with little or no risk. In many Ponzi schemes, rather than engaging in any legitimate investment activity, the fraudulent actors focus on attracting new money to make promised payments to earlier investors as well as to

it is obvious, this kind of scamming is not specific to cryptocurrency world. Actually, Ponzi schemes have been around for ages and Ponzi schemers in cryptocurrency world are just copying the work of others and have usually have nothing new.\n\nIn the cryptocurrency world, there usually is a “cloud mining”, “lending”, or “trading bot” that “will give you money”. But actually, instead of making real money the schemer is paying someone above you or before you with your money and tries to make the network bigger by making a lot of trust that this scheme is working. After some time when the money in hand becomes large enough, the scammer will leave you empty-handed and runs off with your money.\n\n### 6. One Scam I Faced Myself\n\nIn this scam, the scammer had made an Ethereum address and had filled it with some large amount of $USDT. Now, the scammer just gave away their seed phrase to someone else claiming that they can’t take out the $USDT lying in there. In this scam, the scammer actually can take out the $USDT but they won’t just as a bait. Now, the poor user deposits some $ETH to provide the gas fee, and poof!\n\nThere has been a bot set on this specific address that withdraws every $ETH deposited to this address in a matter of seconds. Before you can do anything with the $ETH you deposited, it is gone instantly to another address. Now, it is time for you  to spread it out for the scammer. \n\nYou go to your friend with a bit more knowledge and tell them you have a wallet (you have the seed phrase, don’t you?), that you can’t take out $USDT from it. Your friend tries to put $ETH for the gas fee and again poof!\n\nThis will go on and on until someone with more knowledge or pessimistic enough finds out what actually is happening and stops you from depositing your $ETH to this address and give away your $ETH to the scammer.

负债\n\n作为企业主，我们必须做的事情应该是显而易见的：在不增加负债的情况下获得更多资产，即最大化资本。因此，Sombart 认为复式记账系统为过渡到以私人公司最大化资本，即资本主义为基础的社会提供了必要条件。 该系统的工作原理是从商家的日记帐（单项分类账）中获取交易清单并将它们转移到复式分类账中。通过在一个帐户中添加贷方并在另一个帐户中添加匹配的借方，每个项目都会进入复式记账系统。我举一个例子：你以 5 美元的价格卖掉了一件衬衫，而你原本是用 3 美元买的⁵。在复式系统中，您将：\n\n* 贷记您的库存账户（资产账户）3 美元。贷记，因为存货是通过贷记减少的资产账户。此信用会从您的库存中删除衬衫。\n* 借记您的“商品销售成本”账户（资本账户）3 美元。借方，因为你丢了一件衬衫，借方是资本账户的减少。\n* 借记您的现金账户（资产账户）5 美元。借记，因为现金是通过借记增加的资产账户。\n* 贷记您的“销售收入”账户（资本账户）5 美元。贷记因为销售收入是通过贷记增加的资本项目。\n\n有四个条目，因为此事务中发生了两件事。你失去了衬衫，你获得了 5 美元。将我们资本账户上的条目（商品销售成本和救助收入）相加，我们有 5 美元的贷方和 3 美元的借方，总贷方（资本增加）为 2 美元。 在复杂的业务中，资金和资产可能出于不同的原因进出不同的地方。两次输入事物可在不同位置提供同一事件的两个视图。您可以查看您的资本账户，了解导致借方（资本损失）的原因。同样，您可以查看您的现金账户以了解您的现金流量如何。正在吸走您的现金的东西可能会影响您的资本，也可能不会，例如，如果您正在偿还债务（记录在负债账户中）。复式记账系统使推理这些事情变得容易。 随着复式记账系统无处不在，它为企业、投资者和贷方提供了一种共同语言。来自复式记账系统的财务报表，如[资产负债表](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet)，成为企业展示其信誉或投资潜力的标准方式。这为投资者阶层铺平了道路，这是资本主义的一个基本特征，专门从事他们的分析。 再一次，我们不能肯定地说复式记账系统导致了资本主义。但在我看来，随着复式记账系统从意大利北部蔓延开来，西方世界在经济上重新定位于理性和系统地追求利润。 中央银行和法定货币——作为货币的账本条目（公元 1931 年） 在法定货币发明之前，分类帐条目总是衡量有形拥有或欠款的数量。分类账上的负债是其他人的资产，因为它代表了债务人将来必须转移给债权人的一定数量。那么，除非它可以兑换成有价值的东西，否则你怎么能让账本资产有价值呢？ 答案在于经济价值的基本理念。事物之所以有价值，有两个原因：\n\n* 获得经济利益（个人想要的东西）\n* 避免经济损失（个人不希望发生的事情）的一种手段\n\n由于前一个原因，用黄金兑换分类账条目赋予了它们价值。[亚当·斯密](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith)的以下引用说明了如何使用后一个原因通过税收系统赋予纸币价值：\n\n> *一个君主，如果他规定他的一定比例的税款应该用某种纸币支付，他可能会因此赋予这种纸币一定的价值。即使它的最终解除和赎回期限应该完全取决于王子的意志* *——亚当·斯密，[《国富论的性质和原因的探究》](https://archive.org/details/aninquiryintothe01smituoft)*\n\n 换句话说，坐牢对经济不利。政府有监狱。政府将人们因不缴纳税款而入狱。因此，让分类帐条目交换价值的方法很明显：通过将分类帐信用转移给您来让人们纳税。该方案由中央银行系统实现，大致实现如下：\n\n1. 银行被赋予特殊的法律权力。它被称为中央银行。该国政府在这家银行设有账户。\n2. 中央银行发行可在中央银行以信用方式赎回面值的纸币。\n3. 中央银行不会为任何东西赎回其负债。\n4. 政府只接受通过将其在中央银行的账户（通常通过商业银行）记入贷方，或用纸币支付来支付税款。\n\n有了这四点，就实现了一种新的分类帐技术。中央银行分类账上的数字神奇地具有价值，即使您无法将它们兑换成任何东西！ 英格兰银行 (BoE) 的历史很好地证明了上述情况（我已将满足上述标准标记）： [1844 年的《银行特许法》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Charter_Act_1844)赋予英国央行在发行纸币方面的有效垄断权(1)。英国央行可以将 1 英镑的钞票兑换成一个[Sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_(British_coin))（金币），或者可以转换为 1 英镑的存款（银行信贷）(2)。1931 年，[英国央行停止用黄金赎回他们的票据和存款](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/commodities/11330611/How-the-Bank-of-England-abandoned-the-gold-standard.html) (3)。现在，纸币只能兑换信用，反之亦然。金币过去和现在仍然是法定货币，但它们的交易价格比纸币高，所以用它们纳税是愚蠢的。英国央行的银行信贷和代理银行票据，现在实际上是唯一可以用来纳税的东西(4)。 很容易看出这项技术对政府来说是多么理想。事实上，地球上的每个政府都参与了某种中央银行系统。中央银行的信贷供应完全由政府任命的少数人控制。另一方面，黄金是元素周期表中的一种元素，在世界各地都可以找到。它的供应完全在政治领域之外。在将纸币从黄金中解放出来后，央行可以像使用任何其他资产一样使用其黄金。更重要的是，中央银行可以无限期地购买新资产，方法是用不可赎回的账本条目换取信贷。通常，这种权力用于根据经济数据和中央银行持有的经济理论来购买或出售政府债务以扩大或收缩货币供应量。 中央银行系统使账本数字而不是商品成为人类的货币。大多数人一生中大部分时间都在工作以获取报酬。现在，这具体意味着增加您的银行账户中的数字或获得中央银行票据。中央银行对人类状况造成了微妙但根本的变化。人类收集财富的主要动机从实物转向纸质和电子数据库上的分类账号码。\n\n## 分布式账本（2009 AD）\n\n就在不到 10 年前，一位名叫“中本聪”的匿名人士发表[了一篇](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)名为“比特币：一种点对点电子现金系统”的论文。其核心是一种称为“区块链”的新分类账技术。区块链在一个分散的点对点网络上运行，所有参与者就分类账的状态达成共识。这是第一个不是任何特定个人、团体或政府的工具的分类账。比特币是全世界的去中心化公共账本。 但是什么的公共分类账？好吧，就像在中央银行系统中一样，账本数字（比特币）就是货币本身。与中央银行信用一样，比特币不能兑换任何东西，但与中央银行信用不同，你不能用它纳税。为了拥有公共分类账，区块链只是一个公共分类账。奇怪的是，人们认为拥有这个账本上的条目是值得的。 关于人们为什么愿意为比特币号码放弃他们辛苦赚来的银行号码的完整理论不在本文的讨论范围之内。我打算下次再解释一下。作为起点，这里有一些分布式公共分类账具有中央银行分类账没有的属性：\n\n* 无许可：与中央银行或商业银行分类账不同，您不需要任何人的许可即可拥有条目。这与无法使用可靠电子金融系统的数十亿人尤其相关。出于这个原因，Ouroboros 背后的公司 IOHK 将于 2018 年在加纳、埃塞俄比亚和肯尼亚设立办事处⁶。\n* 没有中央权威：协议的运行是唯一决定系统下一个状态的东西。如果您信任该协议，那么您可以信任该系统。这也意味着除非协议定义了一种方法，否则无法在分类账上创造新资金。\n* 合约执行：区块链可以用编程语言进行扩展。复杂的合约可以用语言编写并在区块链上公开执行。\n* 公开：只要可以在区块链上表示，您就可以使用密码学证明您拥有某物或公开做过某事。\n* 可选匿名：您可以拥有一个条目而无需透露您的个人身份。\n\n这些属性本身并不意味着比特币或其他加密货币应该具有交换价值。但是，如果我们能够以某种方式假设它们有朝一日可以拥有可靠的稳定价值，那么很容易看出这些分类帐改变文明的潜力。\n\n## 未来\n\n上述每种分类账技术在其发明和早期开发时可能看起来都是良性的。只有回过头来看，他们的逻辑在社会中渗透了很多年之后，我们才能看到他们的意义。 分布式账本技术仍处于起步阶段。它已经在分类账的历史上赢得了自己的位置。像其他分类账发明一样，它可能在我们未来社会的发展中发挥重要作用。迄今为止，它最显着的影响是网络毒品市场的兴起、投机狂热和[一些养猫游戏](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)。只有时间会证明它是否会这样做！\n\n 注释：\n\n1. 还有其他较早的人类将符号划入事物的例子，但尚未证实更早使用实际有用的书面语言。\n2. <http://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=old_babylonian_scribal_schools>，“体积和容量单位之间的桥梁：1 sar-volume 相当于 60 gur（约 18 m3 或 18 000 升）” .\n3. <http://ianmorris.org/docs/social-development.pdf>，见 \\[9.2\\] 西部城市规模估计\n4.

"![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/556eut5ZLIkHLtN1z9H-9.png?height=590&width=1050)\n\n中本聪（Satoshi Nakamoto）开发的比特币和区块链的发展标志着彻底改变全球金融的潜力。然后，以太坊智能合约的引入使分散式应用程序（dApps）的增长超出了中心化公司的控制范围。但比特币和以太坊的性能都有限，导致许多人认为区块链本质上是缓慢、昂贵且难以扩展的。\n\n \n\n已经出现了一系列第1层协议，旨在改善不同用例中的这些缺点。尽管由于性能指标和数据的差异，很难比较区块链协议，但交易、可扩展性、节点和能源效率等元素可以帮助评估它们的相对优点。\n\n \n\n考虑到这一点，让我们根据这些参数比较六个区块链：\n\nEthereum ，Cardano ，Solana ，Avalanche，Algorand  和 Internet Computer 。\n\n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dsa7r6C-blCVsC8Smo_u6.png?height=1542&width=2048)\n\n \n\n**交易速度**\n\n \n\n决定区块链网络效率的关键指标之一取决于它处理交易的速度。这涉及两个具体方面：每秒交易量（TPS）和区块确定性或交易确定性。\n\n \n\nTPS是指区块链在一秒钟内可以成功处理多少笔交易；区块确定性表示区块启动与其在分布式账本上的最终不可逆结算之间的持续时间。\n\n \n\nCardano：2 TPS / 10-60 分钟确定性\n\n \n\n据称，Cardano可以处理 250 TPS，报告的块确定时间为 10 分钟到 1 小时，具体取决于网络拥塞情况。据称，其第 2 层扩展解决方案 Hydra 理论上可实现高达 100 万的 TPS 和瞬时区块确定性。但第三方测量显示，Cardano 目前仅支持大约 2 TPS。\n\n \n\nEthereum: 15-20 TPS / 14 分钟确定性\n\n \n\n以太坊通常处理 15-20 TPS，区块确定时间为 14 分钟。在极端网络拥塞期间，这个比率要高得多，完成交易可能需要 14 分钟以上。用户通常必须为每笔交易支付“gas”费用，具体取决于流量，去年达到 1000 美元的峰值。以太坊正试图纠正这一点，即将推出的分片和第 2 层扩展解决方案有望提高交易速度。\n\n \n\nAlgorand：20 TPS / 4-5 秒确定性\n\n \n\nAlgorand 理论上报告处理 1,200 TPS，并打算立即将其增加到 3,000 TPS。根据其指标页面，它实际上处理了 20 TPS。 Algorand 拥有 4-5 秒的区块确定时间。\n\n \n\nSolana：2,000-3,000 TPS / 21-46 秒确定性\n\n \n\nSolana 理论上可以处理 65,000 TPS，但在实践中，它处理大约 2,000-3,000 TPS。当交易在 2021 年 9 月达到 400,000 TPS 的峰值时，它遭遇了中断，引发了对其不稳定性的担忧。 Solana 的理论交易完成时间为 400-500 毫秒，但实际上“乐观确认”需要 21-46 秒。\n\n \n\nAvalanche：4,500 TPS / 2-3 秒确定性\n\n \n\nAvalanche 报告称其测试网可以处理 4,500 TPS，生产就绪版本最终目标是 20,000 TPS。但目前，对于 EVM 兼容的 C-Chain，它只能处理大约 9 TPS。 Avalanche 报告的交易完成时间不到一秒，但可能需要大约 2-3 秒。\n\n \n\nInternet Computer：11,500 TPS / 1 秒确定性\n\n \n\nInternet Computer 当前配置为处理高达 51,666 TPS，但最近的性能测试显示 11,500 TPS，dapp 的最终确定率为 1 秒。这种高比率是由于区块链将更新调用（状态增强）与查询调用（状态中立）区分开来。 Internet Computer 可以在几毫秒内处理超过 250,000 个只读查询调用。\n\n \n\n**可扩展性**\n\n \n\n当区块链支持高交易吞吐量并且可以增长以适应新用户时，它们是可扩展的。可扩展的区块链是网络流量不会显着影响整体性能的区块链。\n\n \n\nEthereum：不是很可扩展\n\n \n\n鉴于以太坊基于工作证明共识运行，以太坊目前的可扩展性不是很高，但它计划通过迁移到权益证明共识来增加容量和可扩展性。它的目标是拥有 64 个带有信标链的分片链，以实现进一步的可扩展性。\n\n \n\nCardano：不是很可扩展\n\n \n\nCardano 在扩展和增加容量的能力方面同样受到限制，但它的目标是在今年某个时候实施第 2 层 Hydra 升级，预计将允许在链上和链下处理相同的代码。\n\n \n\nSolana：不是很可扩展\n\n \n\nSolana 在 2021 年遭受了严重的“资源枯竭”，并在去年 1 月发生了六次中断，这表明其可扩展性有限。 Solana 的历史证明共识协议与 PoS 相结合，每年还会产生大量数据（2 TB）。 Solana 将数据存储在 Arweave 中，从而将敏感的用户数据外包给依赖集中式 Web2 技术的二级来源。\n\n \n\nAvalanche：不是很可扩展\n\n \n\nAvalanche 拥有三个链：交换链（X-Chain）、平台链（P-Chain）和合约链（C-Chain），每条链都管理着迷你网络。与 Solana 一样，Avalanche 也使用 Arweave 和 Ceramic 通过集中式 Web2 技术在链下存储数据，因为它没有自己的存储设施。\n\n \n\nAlgorand：更高的可扩展性\n\n \n\nAlgorand 使用权益证明共识的变体，称为纯权益证明，协议通过该共识选择区块提议者和验证者。利用称为可验证随机函数 (VRF) 的加密过程，Algorand 使用自选算法来选择块创建者。与标准的权益证明协议不同，这种方法可以快速跟踪计算过程并帮助 Algorand 进行扩展。\n\n \n\nInternet Computer：无限可扩展性\n\n \n\nInternet Computer 的基础设施在基础层具有独立的节点机器，这些节点机器结合起来形成独立的子网区块链。子网托管结合代码和数据的“罐式”智能合约，并将执行分为更新和查询调用。每个子网都可以在不依赖其他子网的情况下处理更新/查询调用，从而允许网络通过添加节点和形成新子网来根据需要进行扩展。\n\n \n\n**节点数和云服务依赖**\n\n \n\n区块链节点的数量及其分布是网络相对去中心化的有力指标。由于在链上存储智能合约数据的成本可能非常高，大多数 dApp 通常依赖于集中式服务器和云提供商（如 AWS、谷歌云、微软 Azure 和阿里云）来存储数据并托管其客户端-服务器接口。\n\n \n\nInternet Computer：443 个节点 / 每 GB 5 美元\n\n \n\nInternet Computer 拥有 443 个在全球独立数据中心运行的节点。没有一个是集中式云提供商。节点运营商有硬件要求，以确保区块链可以响应 HTTP 请求并在没有中介的情况下交付 Web 内容。每年存储 1 GB 数据的链上智能合约数据成本为 5 美元。\n\n \n\nAvalanche：1,243 个节点 / 每 GB 988,000 美元\n\n \n\nAvalanche 有使用 AWS 设置节点的文档，表明其 1,243 个节点中的很大一部分可能托管在 AWS 上。在链上存储 1 GB 数据的成本为 988,000 美元。\n\n \n\nSolana：1,603 个节点 / 每 GB 1,000,000 美元\n\n \n\n大多数 Solana 节点都托管在 AWS 等集中式服务器上。它的中断引发了人们的担忧，即如果 33% 的节点离线，Solana 将停止验证新交易。在 Solana 上存储链上数据大约需要 100 万美元。\n\n \n\nAlgorand：1,997 个节点 / IPFS 链下存储\n\n \n\nAlgorand 报告有大约 2,000 个节点，但它们托管在集中式服务器上。虽然没有确切的数字，但 Algorand 依靠 AWS 来扩展其网络。 Algorand 没有使用链上存储，而是使用星际文件系统 (IPFS) 来存储数据。\n\n \n\nCardano：3,173 个节点/数据存储不足\n\n \n\nCardano基金会与 IOHK 和 Emurgo 最初建立了运行网络的节点。他们将区块生产过程移交给了网络的权益池运营商，目前数量为 3,173。目前尚不清楚有多少是云服务。 Cardano 是一个仅可附加的分类帐，用于记录资产所有权和转移，对于永久存储文件是不切实际的。\n\n \n\nEthereum：6,000 个节点 / 每 GB 73,000,000 美元\n\n \n\n以太坊在全球拥有大约 6,000 个节点，其中大部分在集中式服务器上运行。 2020 年，Decrypt 报告称 70% 的以太坊节点在 AWS 上运行。在以太坊主网上存储 1 GB 数据的成本会波动，但目前成本超过 1 亿美元。\n\n \n\n**能源效率**\n\n \n\n区块链技术必须减少其碳足迹才能变得可持续。能源密集型工作证明共识对气候产生不利影响，因为矿工需要大量能源来为其设备供电。\n\n \n\n估计显示，每笔基于以太坊的交易消耗 238 kWh（千瓦时）的能源。 （作为参考，100,000 笔 VISA 交易消耗 149 kWh 的能源。）以太坊矿工每年消耗约 45 TWh（太瓦时）的能源。以太坊向权益证明的过渡预计将大大降低其能源消耗。\n\n \n\nInternet Computer 在链上运行的每笔交易消耗 1.3 千瓦时的能源，而不是外包给集中式云提供商。\n\n \n\n现有的权益证明区块链为单个交易消耗少量能量。 Cardano 单次交易仅消耗 0.5 kWh，而 Solana 上的交易消耗 0.00051 kWh 能量。 Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute 的一份报告显示，Avalanche 每笔交易消耗 0.00476 kWh，Algorand 每笔交易消耗 0.0027 kWh。然而，这些区块链中的每一个都将存储和托管外包给集中式服务器，这其中含有隐藏的碳足迹无法被直观计算。\n\n \n\n**跨链桥**\n\n \n\n区块链网桥支持在两条独立链之间传输数据包和数字资产。 Cardano 依靠 Force Bridge 与 Nervos 区块链进行交易，并与 Bondly 合作连接以太坊和 Cardano NFT。 Avalanche 使用 Avalanche Bridge 与以太坊执行资产转移。\n\n \n\nAlgorand 最终将使用伦敦桥与以太坊连接。同样，Swingby 正在开发 Skybridge 以将比特币与 Algorand 连接起来，而 Solana 使用 Wormhole 与以太坊连接。黑客最近从 Wormhole 窃取了价值 3.2 亿美元的加密货币，各种漏洞利用表明桥梁如何容易受到恶意行为者的黑客攻击。根据 Chainalysis 的研究，在过去一年中，黑客在七起事件中窃取了超过 10 亿美元的加密货币。\n\n \n\nInternet Computer 具有连接以太坊的 Terabethia 桥接器。它还支持无桥的链间集成，仅依赖于区块链的去信任属性。现在它正在与比特币网络集成，为开发人员提供一个 API 来构建比特币智能合约。与以太坊和狗狗币的集成将随之而来。\n\n \n\n**最终用户密钥管理**\n\n \n\n区块链的采用仍然相当缓慢，因为用户对需要安全存储选项的安全密钥管理持谨慎态度。 Facebook 和 Google 等 Web2 应用程序依赖于简单的单点登录 (SSO) 解决方案。而对于大多数 Web3 dApp，用户必须使用复杂的私钥并设置加密钱包才能访问平台。\n\n \n\n在Internet Computer上，用户可以使用移动设备的指纹传感器、面部识别、安全密码、锁定图案等在本地设置 Internet 身份。互联网身份帮助用户匿名验证自己，而不用担心私钥。它还适用于“反向gas”模型，开发人员按周期向智能合约收费，因此用户无需持有代币来支付gas。\n\n \n\n以太坊依靠 AWS 等中心化公司来存储密钥和管理账户，而 Solana 依靠 Torus 等利用 Facebook 或 Google 账户提供平台访问权限的解决方案。不幸的是，这损害了区块链技术的去中心化精神。\n\n \n\nAvalanche 用户需要管理自己的密钥，类似于 Cardano 用户和 Algorand 用户，这可能涉及复杂的密钥和代币钱包。\n\n \n\n**区块链性能**\n\n \n\n总的来说，性能最佳的区块链是在各种用例（即 DeFi、NFT、游戏和各种 dApp 等）中为开发人员和用户提供最大价值的区块链。为此，需要了解给定的 Layer 1 协议在开发人员和用户体验方面提供了什么，以及其生态系统和相关能力的承诺。\n\n \n\n超越性能指标，看看上面讨论的每个区块链网络在不久的将来会发生什么，这将会很有趣。\n\n \n\n \n\n**原文链接：[https://coincodex.com/article/14198/layer-1-performance-comparing-6-leading-blockchains/](https://weibo.cn/sinaurl?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcoincodex.com%2Farticle%2F14198%2Flayer-1-performance-comparing-6-leading-blockchains%2F)**\n\n**翻译：千帆**\n\n**审编：XL**\n\n \n\n**加入欧科链讯社区，掌握区块链世界最新动态！**\n\n**电报频道：https://t.me/ok_telegraph**\n\n**电报社区：https://t.me/ok_telegraph_forum**\n\n**Twitter：欧科链讯**\n\n**电报搜索“欧科链讯”关注我们不迷路哦\\~​**",

{"id": "zJqBFzOVbl7zYoL2HkkR38EkqecjwhQupAkIbM4BCz4", "title": "DID 与 SocialFi 将走的路：找寻 Web3 的灵魂", "body": "> 作者：Diamond, Diane, Maxwell, Evelyn, Carole, Claire\n> Twitter: <https://twitter.com/D_TigerResearch>\n> Discord: <https://discord.gg/CZCM7WesKS>\n\n## 1. Vitalik 等论文摘要\n\n《去中心化社会：找寻 Web3 的灵魂》是 Vitalik 等人联合发表的最新论文，本文讲述了如何通过 “灵魂绑定” Token（本质上来说就是 DID）来建立一个更加多元、丰富的 Desoc（去中心化社会）。论文内容非常长，本文将对这篇论文的重要观点进行转述与总结，这样读者很快就能了解去中心化社会有关知识了。\n\n### 1.1 Web3成立之初的局限性\n\n在不到十年的时间里，Web3 创造了一个庞大的金融帝国，这一成就令世界瞩目，连 facebook 都以 all in 的形式参与到这场金融盛宴之中。加密和经济领域的基础元素，为金融交易带来了一个丰富、开放且多元的生态系统。但是这个过程中出现了一个矛盾，金融交易的经济价值是由人们现实生活中的社会关系等决定的，也就是说它的内部运转逻辑并不完善甚至可以说并不完整。正是由于 Web3 缺乏代表社会身份的基础元素，它从根本上依赖于它所要超越的中心化的 Web2 结构，这具有非常大的局限性。\n\n这种依赖性在具体应用方面也有很明显的体现：\n\n* 虽然 NFT 通过 Opensea 等去中心化平台进行交易，但是许多 NFT 艺术家会通过 Twitter 等中心化平台进行宣传，以向人们证明其真实性并达到推广的目的\n* 各种去中心化项目经常依赖 Web2 基础设施来实施投票\n* 许多 Web3 参与者依赖 Coinbase 或 Binance 等中心化实体管理的托管钱包\n\n此外由于缺乏原生的 Web3 身份，今天的 DeFi 生态系统无法支持实体经济中普遍存在的活动，如等额抵押贷款甚至超低额抵押贷款（目前加密贷款平台一般只支持超额抵押）或者签订公寓租赁等合同。在此我们试图通过“灵魂绑定”的 Token（“soulbound” tokens，SBTs，也就是 DID 去中心化身份）来打破这些局限。除此以外通过 Web3 社会身份，还可以就财富集中和金融攻击的治理脆弱性等更广泛的长期问题上取得巨大进展，同时刺激 web3 的政治、经济和社会应用的大幅发展。我们把这些用例和它们所促成的更丰富的多元生态系统称为“去中心化社会”（DeSoc）。**本文第二部分会就 web2 的社交与 Desoc 进行对比进一步展示出 Desoc 的一些特点与优势。**\n\n### 1.2 Desoc 的要素与畅想\n\n首先我们应先了解一下 DeSoc 的基本元素，它（“灵魂绑定” Token, SBTs） 围绕着人们持有的不可转让的账户（或钱包），代表着承诺、证书和关系，这种 Token 就像一份扩展的简历。可以简单地把这种东西理解为我们的身份证，有了身份证我们就可以缴纳社保、绑定银行卡等。没有身份证或者说法律认可的身份这些都很难实现，而目前的 web3 就处在这种没有身份证明的困局当中。在这里把起身份证明的东西被称为“灵魂”， 将账户持有的 Token 称为“灵魂 Token”（SBTs）。\n\n想象一下这样一个世界，大多数参与者都有“灵魂 Token”，它对应一系列的关系、会员资格和证书。因此人们不用公开自己的真实身份，就可以让他人看到自己的教育证书，就业历史，或自己的著作或艺术作品的一串哈希值，这种 Token 对相关信息的公开类似于人们在简历中分享关于自己的信息。更重要的是，通过这种身份人们可以互相识别，甚至可以实现目前无法达到的等额抵押、合同签订等。人们甚至可以无纸化，因为数据可以记录一切，并且因为它不可篡改的特点，又让一切变得更加可信。在这些技术的支持下 web3 一定会越来越丰富且美好。\n\n### 1.3 相关实例\n\n**艺术与“灵魂”**\n\n艺术家可以通过“灵魂”将作品与自己连接。当发行可交易的 NFT 时，艺术家可以从他们的“灵魂”中发行 NFT。艺术家的“灵魂”携带的 SBTs 越多，买家就越容易识别出“灵魂”是属于该艺术家的，从而也就能确定 NFT 的真实性。艺术家可以更进一步，在他们的“灵魂”中发布一个链接的 SBTs，证明某个 NFT 是该“系列藏品”的成员。因此，“灵魂”将创造一种可靠的、链上的交易和识别方式。 很明显，它的现实应用还有很多，NFT 艺术家的例子只是其中最具有代表性的。实际上，除了 web3 领域外，它也能有解决一些现实问题，比如知识产权、司法文件真伪判断等。毕竟随着深度造假技术的进步，人类和算法的直接检查将越来越无法检测真实性。虽然区块链的加入使我们能够追踪特定作品的制作时间，但 SBTs 将使我们能够追踪相关内容的社会出处，为我们提供丰富的社会背景，让我们了解发布作品的人的“灵魂”——他们的会员资格、关系、证书的组合。通过这种方式“高仿”可以很容易地被识别出来。\n\n**“灵魂”空投**\n\n在具体说明“灵魂”空投之前我们需要明白空投是什么，以及空投的意义到底是什么？区块链领域的空投是一种将数字货币通过区块链技术大规模分发到一些已有的数字货币钱包上的行为，比如以太币、比特币、EOS.IO 钱包。简单来说就是向广大网友“发钱”的过程。\n\n当面对空投人们会有四种行为：（1）上网搜索相关内容（2）和朋友聊相关内容，使朋友知晓有关信息（3）之前或者之后疯狂注册账号，以获得空投（4）直接无视\n\n空投本身是一种非常流行的营销策略，并不是所谓的“慈善”，因此在上述几种情况中，（3）和（4）属于无效空投，并不能带来实际的收益或者说宣传的效果。而其中的第三条属于危害性最大的一条，也就是常说的女巫攻击。为了避免第三条项目方往往设立许多空投限制，但是很明显并不能完全避免。通过 DID 可以有效解决上述问题，因为项目方可以依据 DID 进行空投，可以有效提高投放的精准性和准确性。\n\n论文中的相关例子还有很多这里就不多做列举了，如果感兴趣可以点击[论文原文](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763)进行细致了解。\n\n很显然，上文那两个所谓的相关实例都还是比较理想化的概念。**本文将于第三部分举出一些现有的比较具有代表性的相关去中心化项目，各位读者可以通过这些例子对相关内容予以把握。同时会在第四部分就上文提到的 DID 的使用、价值和发展前景进行详细的说明。**\n\n### 1.4 结论\n\n通过这篇文章大家可以预见到 Desoc 的美好未来，但同时也需要意识到 DID 只是这一远大历程中的一小步。此外，上面描述的场景只是 DeSoc 对现有项目与应用的强化作用，但是并没有涉及对比如物理、政治、社会以及它们与现实世界的复杂关系的描述，而它们实际上占据了我们现实生活的很大比例。所有这些都表明，上面描绘的远大理想，可能只是 DeSoc 最终形态的“雏形”。**论文中就 SBTs 的威胁与挑战也进行了比较细致的描述，在本文的第五部分将结合现实情况进行细致描写这里就不再细说。**\n\n# 2.  新型社交为何悄然而至\n\n### 2.1 Web2.0 传统社交弊病\n\nWeb2.0本质是平台经济，是以一小撮为代表的垄断性寡头构架，互联网在该阶段变成全民级别应用，聚集了社交、搜索、电商等超级生态应用开发，且每个行业领域龙头公司几乎垄断行业资源和发展上限，这使得Web2公司在拥有最终解释权的情况下去剥削和占有用户资源信息时游刃有余，例如微信和QQ在中国产生的影响力和不可置换性，使得用户无法维护本身利益，用户在Web2.0中更像是平台的附庸而不是服务接收者。而Web3.0是属于Token经济的后端程序革命，其本意是在为非平台内部的生态参与者获取更多的话语权和创造权，并拥有产品本身的价值支配权利，以及隐私性和安全性。一定程度的避免了不平衡的垄断机制。\n\n### 2.2 SocialFi 是 Web3.0 的必要组件\n\nSocialFi的出现是对抗传统社交平台弊端的必要产物，Web2.0 时代的社交平台被各大运营巨头控制，从用户数据中获取商业价值，忽略用户的感受。SocialFi基于区块链技术，用户身份信息的匿名性有助于保护隐私和安全，更有利于解决用户数据的确认问题以及权利下放。\n\n相信随着用户对于隐私以及自由的追求，越来越多的人会投身于Web3.0的世界，在用户渴望加密技术带给的数据主权时也渴望获得自己在这个世界独特的身份和地位。在Web2.0-3.0过渡的过程中，互联网用户需要一些中间件来从简单迁移到复杂，从而从原始空间迁移到元空间。元空间的实现需要从现有的互联网世界出发，利用一系列的Web3.0组件，分批分阶段的迎接新的用户。在尝试了Defi的去中心化资产流、NFT的数字工作价值、发现Gamefi的P2E之后，去中心化的意见发布和个人展示已经下一个需要探索和开发的Web3.0组件，在互联网发展历史中可以发现社交化可以说是网民的刚性需求。\n\n### 2.3 线上数据分析\n\n根据[Zippa](https://www.zippia.com/advice/cryptocurrency-statistics/)的统计以及交易平台和钱包的来源，2018-2020 年全球加密货币用户群增加了近 190%，2021 年进一步加速。 数据的增加可能是由于账户数量的增加以及身份识别的改进，以及在 2021 年特斯拉和万事达卡等公司宣布进军加密货世界等从热度上升带来的用户数量造成的。下图展示了Web3.0近几年来的趋势变化：         \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jov7Glf5pfabWlpkN1DD0.png?height=482&width=1141)\n\n根据Google Search数据统计，如今的互联网 2.0 使用用户约在 49.5 亿人左右，对标3亿的加密用户都还只是冰山一角。绝大多数的互联网用户都害困在传统社交网络中，让加密应用的热度扩散才是Web 3.0 走向主流用户的最关键一步。\n\n# 3. 理念的实际运用\n\n### 3.1 ENS\n\nENS”，全称 Ethereum Name Service， 是一个基于以太坊区块链的分布式，开放，可扩展的命名系统。简单来说，通过它可以把原本难以记忆的以太坊地址变成自定义的短地址。通过这种方式，人们可以轻易记下有关内容，既可以减少工作的繁琐程度，也可以减少不必要的风险。同时让用户可以通过以太坊账户和 ENS 配置文件控制自己的数字身份，不再依赖于传统的“中介”。\n\n**技术**\n\n这往往是在注册中心和解析器实现的：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KxP_2muLbCWAntIOITBtl.png?height=458&width=486)\n\nENS注册中心由一个智能合约组成，该合约维护所有域和子域的列表，并存储所有域和子域的三个关键信息：\n\n* 域的所有者\n* 域的解析器\n* 域下所有记录的缓存时间\n\nENS 注册中心作用很简单，只是为了从名称映射到负责它的解析器。解析器负责将名称转换为地址。任何有相关功能的合约都可以作为ENS中的解析器。\n\n在ENS中解析名称有两个步骤：首先，询问注册中心是哪个解析器负责该名称，其次，请该解析器回答查询。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/duhbK48dgxF77doKkPN3t.png?height=254&width=467)\n\n比如，我们试图找到\"foo. eth\"指向的以太坊地址。首先，我们询问注册中心哪个解析器负责“foo. eth”。然后，我们向解析器查询“foo. eth\"的地址。\n\n**数据**（截止至2022-05-23）\n\nDiscord关注：4万+\n\nTwitter关注：18.3万\n\n数据显示，以太坊域名服务商 ENS 在 5 月份以来的收入已经达到了 802 万美元，创下今年以来的新高。今年以来 ENS 已经累计获得了 4864 万美元的收入。\n\n**小结**\n\n通过运作流程可以看出来，整个过程并不会侵害用户的隐私，但是又为加密交易和地址记忆提供了便利条件。V神曾评论说：“ENS是迄今为止最成功的非金融类以太坊应用程序，基本可以类比为一个去中心化的电话册”。很明显它是前文所提到的 Desoc 的一个现实应用和技术支撑，随着行业的发展具有非常巨大的发展潜力。\n\n### 3.2 Bright ID\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wuZhsWQvRKNVOjwoLfTC_.png?height=609&width=1920)\n\nBrightID 是 Web3.0 用户的身份系统，基于以太坊开发，它是完全独立于传统和互联网身份认证的系统。一般用于DAPP用户验证；活动验证；信誉构建等。\n\n具有以下特点：\n\n无门槛：任何人都有权利拥有 Bright ID。\n\n隐私性：Bright ID 不会向用户索取或捕获任何个人隐私信息。\n\n开源：公共产品，完全免费且开源。\n\n**运作和验证方式**\n\nBrightID需要经过人脸和多人认证的方式来通过审核。认证结合链下会议视频等非隐私信息渠道的方式，采用视频会议的形式，由以上六位验证官负责主持验证会议并进行验证工作。验证会议的具体时间日历可在 BrightID 官网查看。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gp05mZ9Gx-tgYSiH2uGga.png?height=354&width=1280)\n\n**相关数据**\n\n融资信息\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BmJ3Z3sIoWc7xg5mA4WAk.png?height=70&width=514)\n\nMetaCartel 是一个由软件工程师、创业者以及以太坊爱好者构建的去中心化社区。他们在全球拥有600多名成员，他们具有丰富的领域经验和专业技能。已经为很多此领域最受欢迎的新兴项目提供了早期资金：Mintbase；Known Origin；Kickback；RocketNFT；Gelato Finance等。\n\n数据分析(截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注：13.2K\n\nAPP 融合：13款\n\nBright ID 用户：57K+\n\n**合作方：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySb7HH2E3tUyY-Zz9BFgX.png?height=471&width=1323)\n\n**小结**\nBrightID 在Web3.0时代扮演着很重要的角色，DAPP&APP、活动组织都采用 BrightID 进行身份验证。但这仅仅是 BrightID 潜力的一小部分，随着 BrightID 产品的迭代，以及其构建的信任网络不断扩大，将成就 BrightID 无限的可能性。\n\n### 3.3 MetaMask\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0n_GpHSQzK8HF-UjI7TT-.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nMetaMask，又或是人们口中常说的“小狐狸”钱包，日益成为加密圈内不可或缺的工具，你的钱包地址在一定程度上，可以代表你个人在链上的身份。\n\nMetaMask是一个通过web2互联网浏览器就能访问，且以低门槛与以太坊网络进行交互的工具钱包。它是Consensys目前面对终端用户的唯一产品，是以太坊最早的钱包之一，也是目前用户量最大的钱包。始于2015年，长期以网页端、免费、“半官方”的形态为大众所熟知，属于非托管型钱包。随着2020年Defi应用热潮与2021年NFT的火爆市场效应，MetaMask的用户量极速增长。2020年新增手机客户端和交易功能（名为Swap）。2021年5月推出MetaMask机构版，让机构用户能将MetaMask与机构级托管结合、方便工作流管理、易于汇报等。\n\n但起初，MetaMask其实并不是作为钱包插件之类的消费者项目，而是希望成为一种开发工具。Metamask母公司，是以太坊联合创始人Joseph Lubin所创办的区块链巨头公司之一的ConsenSys。ConsenSys 是以太坊重点项目的企业孵化器，旗下的MetaMask是ConsenSys布局的六大业务板块基础设施板块的重点项目。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YnjEZyE-akF8hkOslm1UO.png?height=188&width=839)\n\n**技术**\n\n现MetaMask已兼容绝大部分的区块链网络Dapp（包括Ethereum、Binance、Polygon），可集成托管解决方案来管理秘钥存储和多重签名批准。团队也在逐步优化产品本身，简化交易流程、减少交易费用、签字程序等。并逐步提升其合规能力，让钱包内可以进行高风险评估，安全进行去中心化和匿名交易等。\n对于大量的用户选择MetaMask作为迈入Web3的第一步，团队除了打磨好产品，提升钱包本身的安全性能，用户友好度之外。面对发展迅猛的加密货币行业，使用需求量的暴增与跨网络的需求都是不可忽视的问题。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pzMu5CxfcUo_ekJI1Ma9l.png?height=419&width=1445)\n\n**相关数据（截止到2022-05-23）**\n\n**Twitter关注**：75.4 K\n\n**融资情况**：2022-03-16，ConsenSys 完成4.5亿美元D轮融资，完成最新一轮融资后，ConsenSys的估值超过70亿美元，比2021年11月完成2亿美元C 轮融资时的估值增加一倍以上。ConsenSys首席执行官Joe Lubin在接受Decrypt采访时表示，MetaMask很快将推出DAO并发行代币。新的DAO并不会参与管理MetaMask，但将为MetaMask的更新提供资金。可见，MetaMask的资金储备是比较充足的。\n\n**其他数据**：\n\n根据公开数据，截止目前，MetaMask的月活跃用户已达到3000万。而巅峰时期的以太坊全网活跃地址也才只有 800 万左右。不难看出，Meta钱包的月活跃数量远超于此，也印证了MetaMask钱包现在已经成为了大量加密的首选。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZijDJTKGeNWtZC7Higmnt.png?height=804&width=1526)\n\n截止到2022年3月份，MetaMask插件的下载了超过1,000,000，目前日活跃用户大概在6k-8k左右，每日新用户超过2K+。目前加密货币钱包类用户早已超过8000万，对于一些出现的维护问题，团队已出现了棘手的情况。\n\n相较于互联网46亿的活跃用户来说，加密货币未来的将拥有更广阔的市场。目前MetaMask主要支持以太坊和各种EVM链，未来若想跨接到Solana等多生态，团队将如何开拓和维系其服务，值得期待。\n\n**小结**\n\n如今，MetaMask的使用已相当普及，这似乎已成为了进入Web3的第一步——生成你的去中心化钱包地址。而钱包也逐渐成为区块链世界中的一种身份象征，作为用户使用频率最高的小狐狸钱包，swap与NFT购买，是其最常用的两个功能。也因为以太坊生态中任何一个应用，都会支持MetaMask，两者的发展相辅相成，逐渐将钱包地址与Web3世界里去中心化个人身份的划上等号。\n未来，伴随着多链时代的到来，通用钱包的概念或将被逐渐被弱化，取而代之的可能是针对性更强的点对点产品服务，如专门的NFT钱包，打金钱包等。随着时间的推移，MetaMask自身以及新生代的钱包的发展都同样值得期待\n\n### 3.4 CyberConnect \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eXmS6-XLpYtKe3eZn9mQm.png?height=77&width=346)\n\nCyberconnect旨在解决社交图表（Social Graph）再分配问题，这个问题其实很好去解释，就是说Web2.0中各种平台的信息无法互通，造成重复资源浪费且难以找到各种志同道合的用户，社交图谱相对单一。\n\n而Cyberconnect所表明的内涵或者本质也很简单（用户之间的关系不仅仅是双向或者三向的，更是各种交叉和重叠的混合网络关系）例如A本身，与A关注的用户，和关注A的用户进行不同连线组合，形成一张独特的“图谱”，证明该用户的社交关系网，而从这些与用户A有联系的人又重新编织，又将形成新的图谱。这样网络世界中拥有相同的兴趣爱好的用户，同游戏玩家，商品贸易中的的买家卖家等通过社交图谱逐渐变得清晰。**如此一来，CyberConnect 便打破了不同平台之间的壁垒。**\n\n**技术**\n\n关于数据和存储：CyberConnect社交图数据存储时使用的IPFS和无许可协议Ceramic构建，联通Ceramic区块链锚定和自定义数据固定服务，可以保证CyberConnect链上数据长期存储。（使用Ceramic DID方法）关于用户数据在不同的平台如何集成，则需要采用Ceramic身份协议IDX，它为开发人员提供一个统一的界面，在CyberConnect内部查询这些数据分析，反过来CyberConnect也会给与DID链上系统提供更多的身份数据。\n\n与其它项目集成：同时CyberConnect还会与其它Web3项目集成获取信息，例如NFT平台Foundation与Rarible等，其实最重要的一点是让玩家通过一个统一的身份来参与不同种类的生态应用，同时也能与Web2链接使链上和链下数据结合起来成为更强大的去中心化数据提供商。\n\n**相关数据：**(数据截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注数：57,7k+\n\n生态项目数：30+\n\n入驻用户：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a7o2JaOaNfPgndwT2sSm3.png?height=108&width=679)\n\n融资消息：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MKRShXhLUbStaV7wGpQdV.png?height=127&width=685)\n\n其中的Multicoin曾投资过Near Protocol、Solana、Helium、Duna Analytics、Audius等潜力新兴区块链或者具有足够实际应用的优质Web3.0应用，此次Cyberconnect也正是该机构看好未来web3社交领域的潜力而开展的首次社交应用投资，证明该赛道的早期成长属性和该项目未来价值发掘。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgkZfhUF3wFkZo_i2RlCP.png?height=542&width=1145)\n\n**小结**\n\n社交化图标也是DID最核心应用场景之一。毕竟身份的重要程度随着社交功能完善等比例增长。虽然目前Cyberconnect已经接入Solana、Ethereum、Binance网络链，在用户体验感上来说，以太坊网络链是功能较完善且操作流畅，但部分操作功能在Solana上还处于开发阶段，不仅容易在网络上造成拥堵而且需要使用不同的钱包插件，使得用户体验感下降。\n\n作为一个去中心化的社交图谱协议，为Web3.0社会网络和元宇宙服务，CyberConnect还需要在前进的道路上完成更多的目标。\n\n### 3.5 Mirror\n\n提到去中心化的写作平台，大部分区块链用户都会脱口而出“Mirror”，其平台在成立不到一年就被联合广场风险投资公司估值1亿美元，获1千万美元投资。作为去中心化的写作平台赛道代表——Mirror 是依靠哪些去中心化特性和功能”荣登“宝座呢？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jylJj2d9u5m_YMYfOnvQA.png?height=601&width=865)\n\n**功能简介**\n\nMirror 跟中心化的写作平台最大的不同是，他具备加密区块链产品的特性和功能。参与用户无需通过邮箱账号，手机号码，社交帐户等中心化的身份验证手段来注册账号，只需要绑定自己的0x开头的钱包地址即可生成独一无二的“作者专栏”，类似于上文所提及的ENS（以太坊域名）。对于部分创作者来说，跟外界的接触仅仅由一串小小的字符连接，完美的融合了去中心化身份的理念。\n\n除此之外，创作者可以在Mirror平台上发布文章/创作图片等作品，每一件公开发布的作品不是保存在中心化服务器上，而是透过区块链存储专案Arweave进行链上的数据保存，经用户进行加密签名后生成一段哈希值记录，将作品永久的保存在区块链上。Mirror上更是支持创作者将自己的作品铸造成NFT，让原先没有边际成本、可被无限复制的内容作品具有稀缺性，从而被赋予价值。不仅无法被他人复制或修改，而且可以在各大NFT市场上进行售卖。\n\n其次，Mirror

Mirror 的存储组件-Arweave，是一条针对存储进行了底层性能优化的公链，因此用户在 Arweave 链上存储数据的成本相较其他智能合约公链平台有极大的降低。同时，链上存储的特征保证了在 Arweave 之上存储数据的永久性，因此，基于 Arweave 的存储模式也常被归类为永久存储。创作者在保存文章修改的时候，Mirror 会在后台自动对新的文章进行二次上链存储。\n2. Mirror 的确权组件，在存储的同时，通常会需要另一组 Web3 组件，以便对存储的内容进行确权，也就是将内容铸造为 NFT 格式的资产。但此步骤是在以太坊网络上以 NFT 的形式进行确权，成本由创作者自行承担支付。\n\n**相关数据（截至2022-05-23）**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XVwj7o6LqQYrJBLA3h4dT.png?height=70&width=698)\n\n**小结**\n\n去中心化创作平台-Mirror 的核心创新点很多，打破了传统创作平台的束缚，将NFT，社区DAO，Write-Fi相结合的经济模型，解决了部分去中心化平台所追求的“通过创作内容实现价值变现”的难题，相信 Mirror 这样肩负着去中心化任务的创作平台也会在迈向 WEB3.0 的道路上越走越远。\n\n### 3.6 Project Galaxy\n\nProject Galaxy 的愿景是想要打造一个最大的 Web3 数据凭证（credential data）网络，建造一个开放协作数据聚合基础设施，助力开发者和项目方建造更好的产品和社区。项目方在 Project Galaxy 平台上面为用户创建并奖励 NFT，用户完成项目方的任务，比如在链上进行特定的交互、参加会议、关注推特、加入 Discord 社区、提交问卷、参与测试等方式获得NFT。\n\n**技术：**\n\nProject Galaxy 目前支持两种方式来提供数据凭证 GraphQL 和 REST API。Galaxy上有两个角色，分别是数据贡献者和使用者。数据贡献者可以用子图查询或静态快照（subgraph queries or static snapshots）的方式贡献链上数据，同时在链下，Galaxy 也集成了信息来源，比如推特和 GitHub。\n\n数据使用者使用 Application module, Credential Oracle Engine, and Credential API 三种方式使用数据。并使用 Galaxy 的代币 $GAL 支付，因此数据贡献者可以获得激励。\n\n**相关数据**：\n\n已入驻项目方：400+\n\nGalaxy ID 用户：170 万+\n\nTwitter关注：30 万+\n\n融资情况：2021 年 5 月种子轮融资，2022年1月由 Multicoin Capital 和 Dragonfly Capital 领投、多个机构参投的 1000 万美元融资。随后 2 月在 CoinList 平台公募获得 1500 万美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gZN7tj9iV2lHWkssLK7Z3.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nProject Galaxy上线时间为2021年5月，运行不到一年，活跃用户量远大于同类型的项目 POAP 和 Rabbithole 。2021 年底银河女孩系列 NFT 活动让 Project Galaxy 一举成名，银河女孩 NFT 持有者更是获得了该项目原生代币 $GAL 在 CoinList 平台上公募的优先队列名额。后续 Meta Cowboy，Dr.SOL 等系列 NFT 持有者也获得了 $GAL 空投。\n\n**小结**\n\nProject Galaxy 无疑是一个非常成功的项目。链上身份凭证和数字身份一直都有市场需求，Project Galaxy 作为多链项目满足了市场在这方面的需求，为整个加密生态系统提供服务。在经历 Defi Summer 和 NFT Summer 之后 ，它抓住了 Crypto 项目方频繁使用 NFT 作为用户激励工具的需求。它给项目方提供了发放 NFT 奖励活动的工具和用户流量资源，初步形成了项目方和项目方之间，项目方和用户之间，用户和用户之间的多重网络效应。\n\n# 4. 新型社交的展望\n\n### 最初的载体与未来场景？\n\n绝大部分用户最熟悉DID理念实际运用应该是区块链钱包，例如Metamask是作为用户接入整个区块链的入口端，具有隐私性、安全性、不可追踪性。这是DID赛道最初应用成果，但是其缺点也很明确。钱包地址的注册缺少独特性，一个人可以注册大量毫无价值的钱包。其次大钱包只能显示代币难以展示NFT和参与证明等未来势必流行的资产，更不用说SBT所畅享的“无纸化”证明，这是钱包的局限性。第三钱包无法配置资产可编程属性，无法限制其他人查看钱包资产，从而导致黑客攻击情况发生。不过理念的实践是处于不断完善的过程。现在已经出现了可以展示NFT和参与证明（POA）的去中心化身份应用，还有隐私赛道对于钱包和其它DID应用进行代币隐私化、资产可视化等功能赋能等，预计不短时间内所有区块链赛道应用可以进行用户DID绑定，可记录用户等额抵押、合同签订、参与证明和哈希参数等不可篡改的数据，潜在提升单一用户DID价值\n\n从结构和理论上来阐述，有社交的地方更加注重身份特征，所以从根本属性上来说SocialFi就是实现该理念的最初赛道，只有用户们尝试并参与进来，才能够从本质上理解DID在区块链各赛道中重要程度，在未来去中心化社交领域当中，寻找相同理念思想的用户从而构建和谐关系，通过新兴匹配技术进行身份特征快速转移和整合，快速的梳理出用户兴趣爱好与社交圈，可以大程度的减少网络中诈骗行为，提高社交沟通交流效率。\n\n### 如何评估用户DID价值赋能？\n\n未来DID账号的价值根据其内部的资产总数和分配比例，如加密货币、NFT、参与证明等进行价值评估，以及个人身份信息验证，与其他用户之间互动，评论留言等进行附加属性评估。最后就是项目之间的筛选机制和会员资格评判，如拥有某些NFT或者证明的用户获得相应空投奖励、参与测试的资格等，这些都进一步的丰富了DID整体价值属性。\n\n对于目前市场来说，DID基础设施赛道仍未出现热点项目能引领该赛道的热潮，例如DeFi的火热是Uniswap带领的，GameFi的出圈前者与Axie有关，后者StepN再次引领，所以扩大潜在用户群体还需要落实到实际具体项目当中，单一可行的理念是无法吸引到足够的投资者的。\n\nDID赛道本身是没有主动生产价值的能力，创建了钱包地址不代表钱包有钱，但是从另一角度来说DID也是最能兼容区块链中所有领域的基础设施，其价值决定极大程度上基于与其它项目应用的兼容，毕竟DID属于后端程序，与个性化应用并不冲突。\n\n### 趋势预测\n\n在如今整体环境影响下，以NFT和GameFi赛道为首的炒作属性偏高的赛道整体估值下降较多，新用户和资金参与量明显下跌，而以Web 3.0等基础设施属性较强的底层架构融资情况增长。可以明确的是DID与SocialFi等赛道会长时间处于发展道路中，寻找相关实际应用和价值层次赋能，且随着未来涌入区块链赛道的用户会越来越多，下一个牛市用户数量可能会达到三到五倍的增幅，用户之间的社交属性和凭证需求会随着用户数等比例增长，所以目前早期部署该赛道，其未来潜力也是无法估量的。\n\n# 5. DID 与 SocialFi 发展过程中可能的挑战\n\nDID 赛道 和 SocialFi 目前处于早期探索阶段，有着巨大的发展前景，隐藏着许多仍未被发掘的机会，但同时也有着不少问题等待 Web3 建设者们去挑战：\n\n* 不可转让这一概念本身就存在着技术上的挑战，在限制或防止转移的需求和区块链生态系统之间有着难以跨越的障碍，因为目前来说，几乎所有的项目标准都是围绕着最大可转移性来设计的。\n* 隐私是此类生态系统良好运作的一个重要前提。许多情况下，用户并不希望透露他们所有的身份信息。去中心化的身份信息如何做到仅在必要的时候披露给必要的对象，也是在技术上所面临的一大挑战。\n\n一个只规范资本而不规范人类个人行为的制度可能只会无情地服务于金钱而非人类本身。我们作为 Web3 的参与者和建设者，需要更多的思考和更多的努力来解决这些挑战。而如果我们能够成功解决，则为区块链那些并非只关注金钱的生态系统，打开了一扇通往更为广阔天地的大门。\n\n## 参考资料\n\n1.

Mt's will re-define your social relationship graph. Mt's image tells us that when we started to enter the crypto world, many people are the watchers, they were or surprised, or skeptical, or excited, or afraid. However, as an objective rule, the arrival of anything new alway create chaos, some won, some lost, some waited and waited.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TgeTe7CmlqD3rabUmqF8B.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n### Participation\n\n**Mt's are issued in 12600 pieces.** Every Mt's has its unique characteristics and rarity. Mt's will help you realize your social value, allowing you to gain fun and income from your social connections and behavior. Mt's wants to flip the NFT market with new form of energy. NFT shall not be the chips in the hand of the rich, at least that’s not Mt’s. Mt’s owners help each other in a way that no one has ever done.\n\n**Mt's will issue the first 50 pieces as the seed, half of which will be given as Whitelist to those who have participated and contributed in Mt’s early stages, the other half goes to the first official mint pool where everyone can participate.**\n\nTo obtain the first 50 Mt’s are required to go to Mt’s website, log into personal page for the Invitation Code(IC). ICs are the permission to participate mint. Make sure IC in the pocket prior to each mint round.\n\n**Mt's mint uses an incremental model with an initial price of 0.09 ETH.**\n\n![Totally 6\\*round mint](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nR0342P3yeQvBlOoqlx2s.png?height=1698&width=3396)\n\n## Beyond the PFPs, go ride with mtier!\n\n### Mtier Rank Program\n\nIn order to promote Mt’s influence and build solid relationship among members, Mt’s has its unique incentive program, the Mtier Rank Program(MRP). Once user own Mt’s NFT, he/she becomes a mtier Noob. After completing 2\\*invites and both invitees successful mint Mt’s, mtier Noob go to the rank, the MRP automatically kicks in.\n\nEach mtier has his/her rank(except the Noob), ranks come with different allowances.\nMRP reward is made of two parts: Share reward and Royalties.\nShare reward is an invitation-oriented incentive.\n\n**i.g.**\nMtier1 invites 2\\*mtier2 and both mtier2 sucessfully mint Mt’s NFT, mtier1 will gain 24% share reward from mtier2’s mint costs.  \nIf mtier2 has his/her own 2\\*mtier3 minted Mt’s NFT, mtier2 will gain 24% share reward from mtier3’s mint costs, meanwhile mtier1 gains 12%  share reward from mtier3’s mint costs.\n\nAlso mtiers will gain 10% of the royalties when their Mt’s NFT in Opensea, etc.\nThe specific allowance rate chart shows as following:\n\n![The specific allowance rate chart](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OTy6hxsjyHA5QxGLV_dT8.png?height=1698&width=3396)\n\n### Funds Allocation\n\n**All mint funds will be distributed according to the following rules:**\n50\\.87% will go to Mtier Rank Program.24.13% will be awarded to the CON LAB.\n25% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**Royalty income will be distributed according to the following rules:**\n2\\.49% will be awarded to all users holding NFT and participating in the invitation.\n3% will be awarded to the CON LAB.\n4\\.45% will be reserved as the Mt’s Community Treasury.\n\n**The Mt’s Community Treasury:**20% of the Foundation's funds will be used for acquisitions and marketing.80% will be reserved for bonuses.\n\nWhen only 5% of total market Mt's NFT are remained, all bonuses will be shared equally.\n\n### Mt's DAO\n\nAll users holding Mt's NFT are members of Mt's DAO. Mt's DAO members can vote in project decisions and can decide how to use bonuses and whether to acquire new NFTs. Mt's DAO will in future be involved and influence the development of Mt's NFT as the core decision maker of Mt's NFT.\n\n### Reward collection\n\nThe mtier who have activated the rewards, can collect them on Mt’s official website. In order to better motivate new comer, Mt's NFT has been reorganized on the collection mechanism-all Mt's NFT that has collected rewards will be automatically destroyed. This deflation mechanism can increase the value of retained Mt 's NFT. After destruction, designated mtier will receive a new vMt's NFT as a credential to record your existing social network.\n\n### vMt's NFT Function\n\nvMt's NFT is a derivative NFT after the original Mt's NFT is destroyed. 20% of vMt's NFT will be used as the seed for the next project and the rest can be redeemed for future CON LAB new projects. Holding vMt's NFT will also continue to maintain your existing social connections, meaning you will continue to increase the value  your social connections. Further more, Holding vMt's NFT will also give you the opportunity to receive token airdrops.\n\n### Mt's redefines NFT\n\n\"The next era will be defined by today's social networking sites and the depth of connection given to users, and our job is to find the best way for users to share themselves\" - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nThe value of relationships is based on the sharing economy, which means sharing one's state of being, one's information, one's interests, one's hobbies. The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT.\n\n### CON LAB Eco\n\nMt's is the first NFT series in the CON LAB eco-system to permanently record social networks through NFTs and continue them in a new eco-system. Minting a new NFT in the new ecology through vMt's NFT credentials you can reinstate your social network and continue to enjoy the benefits of sharing. Mt’s aims to build a perpetual social-fi  generator in Web3.\n\nThe CON LAB will create a decentralized NFT trading platform driven by influencers and the community through a perpetual network of social connections, with the proceeds of each transaction distributed to the platform's NFT holders to enjoy perpetual dividends and a true return of equity to the user.\n\n## What is Mt's\n\n***The Made-it's , The Miss-it's, The My-turn's!***\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ta-DM7lFHd1a24z5Ms0SF.png?height=1600&width=1600)\n\nThis was a great movement that will eventually be remembered in crypto history. Free from the interference of capitals and authorities. There are no losers in this movement.\n\nThis time we are not a bystander, we are expressing our emotions in a way that will influence more crypto practitioners.\n\nFrom this moment on, Mt's will change the world.\n\n### Follow Mt’s NFT\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MtsNFTs)    |    [Disocrd](https://discord.gg/TK3VCgH4pR)    |    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUahYxfJ2xaB9W9js3ifWQ)\n\n## Don't wait&see, up with Mt’s.", "timestamp": 1653379513, "digest": "vyA5575rvQ7kbqkumCcLLXqMptIBWzFhFzwE4MfQexc", "contributor": "0x5b23A5d907805a4dcFBe13aE232442A6746c5C9C"}

Vitalik 等论文摘要\n\n《去中心化社会：找寻 Web3 的灵魂》是 Vitalik 等人联合发表的最新论文，本文讲述了如何通过 “灵魂绑定” Token（本质上来说就是 DID）来建立一个更加多元、丰富的 Desoc（去中心化社会）。论文内容非常长，本文将对这篇论文的重要观点进行转述与总结，这样读者很快就能了解去中心化社会有关知识了。\n\n### 1.1 Web3成立之初的局限性\n\n在不到十年的时间里，Web3 创造了一个庞大的金融帝国，这一成就令世界瞩目，连 facebook 都以 all in 的形式参与到这场金融盛宴之中。加密和经济领域的基础元素，为金融交易带来了一个丰富、开放且多元的生态系统。但是这个过程中出现了一个矛盾，金融交易的经济价值是由人们现实生活中的社会关系等决定的，也就是说它的内部运转逻辑并不完善甚至可以说并不完整。正是由于 Web3 缺乏代表社会身份的基础元素，它从根本上依赖于它所要超越的中心化的 Web2 结构，这具有非常大的局限性。\n\n这种依赖性在具体应用方面也有很明显的体现：\n\n* 虽然 NFT 通过 Opensea 等去中心化平台进行交易，但是许多 NFT 艺术家会通过 Twitter 等中心化平台进行宣传，以向人们证明其真实性并达到推广的目的\n* 各种去中心化项目经常依赖 Web2 基础设施来实施投票\n* 许多 Web3 参与者依赖 Coinbase 或 Binance 等中心化实体管理的托管钱包\n\n此外由于缺乏原生的 Web3 身份，今天的 DeFi 生态系统无法支持实体经济中普遍存在的活动，如等额抵押贷款甚至超低额抵押贷款（目前加密贷款平台一般只支持超额抵押）或者签订公寓租赁等合同。在此我们试图通过“灵魂绑定”的 Token（“soulbound” tokens，SBTs，也就是 DID 去中心化身份）来打破这些局限。除此以外通过 Web3 社会身份，还可以就财富集中和金融攻击的治理脆弱性等更广泛的长期问题上取得巨大进展，同时刺激 web3 的政治、经济和社会应用的大幅发展。我们把这些用例和它们所促成的更丰富的多元生态系统称为“去中心化社会”（DeSoc）。**本文第二部分会就 web2 的社交与 Desoc 进行对比进一步展示出 Desoc 的一些特点与优势。**\n\n### 1.2 Desoc 的要素与畅想\n\n首先我们应先了解一下 DeSoc 的基本元素，它（“灵魂绑定” Token, SBTs） 围绕着人们持有的不可转让的账户（或钱包），代表着承诺、证书和关系，这种 Token 就像一份扩展的简历。可以简单地把这种东西理解为我们的身份证，有了身份证我们就可以缴纳社保、绑定银行卡等。没有身份证或者说法律认可的身份这些都很难实现，而目前的 web3 就处在这种没有身份证明的困局当中。在这里把起身份证明的东西被称为“灵魂”， 将账户持有的 Token 称为“灵魂 Token”（SBTs）。\n\n想象一下这样一个世界，大多数参与者都有“灵魂 Token”，它对应一系列的关系、会员资格和证书。因此人们不用公开自己的真实身份，就可以让他人看到自己的教育证书，就业历史，或自己的著作或艺术作品的一串哈希值，这种 Token 对相关信息的公开类似于人们在简历中分享关于自己的信息。更重要的是，通过这种身份人们可以互相识别，甚至可以实现目前无法达到的等额抵押、合同签订等。人们甚至可以无纸化，因为数据可以记录一切，并且因为它不可篡改的特点，又让一切变得更加可信。在这些技术的支持下 web3 一定会越来越丰富且美好。\n\n### 1.3 相关实例\n\n**艺术与“灵魂”**\n\n艺术家可以通过“灵魂”将作品与自己连接。当发行可交易的 NFT 时，艺术家可以从他们的“灵魂”中发行 NFT。艺术家的“灵魂”携带的 SBTs 越多，买家就越容易识别出“灵魂”是属于该艺术家的，从而也就能确定 NFT 的真实性。艺术家可以更进一步，在他们的“灵魂”中发布一个链接的 SBTs，证明某个 NFT 是该“系列藏品”的成员。因此，“灵魂”将创造一种可靠的、链上的交易和识别方式。 很明显，它的现实应用还有很多，NFT 艺术家的例子只是其中最具有代表性的。实际上，除了 web3 领域外，它也能有解决一些现实问题，比如知识产权、司法文件真伪判断等。毕竟随着深度造假技术的进步，人类和算法的直接检查将越来越无法检测真实性。虽然区块链的加入使我们能够追踪特定作品的制作时间，但 SBTs 将使我们能够追踪相关内容的社会出处，为我们提供丰富的社会背景，让我们了解发布作品的人的“灵魂”——他们的会员资格、关系、证书的组合。通过这种方式“高仿”可以很容易地被识别出来。\n\n**“灵魂”空投**\n\n在具体说明“灵魂”空投之前我们需要明白空投是什么，以及空投的意义到底是什么？区块链领域的空投是一种将数字货币通过区块链技术大规模分发到一些已有的数字货币钱包上的行为，比如以太币、比特币、EOS.IO 钱包。简单来说就是向广大网友“发钱”的过程。\n\n当面对空投人们会有四种行为：（1）上网搜索相关内容（2）和朋友聊相关内容，使朋友知晓有关信息（3）之前或者之后疯狂注册账号，以获得空投（4）直接无视\n\n空投本身是一种非常流行的营销策略，并不是所谓的“慈善”，因此在上述几种情况中，（3）和（4）属于无效空投，并不能带来实际的收益或者说宣传的效果。而其中的第三条属于危害性最大的一条，也就是常说的女巫攻击。为了避免第三条项目方往往设立许多空投限制，但是很明显并不能完全避免。通过 DID 可以有效解决上述问题，因为项目方可以依据 DID 进行空投，可以有效提高投放的精准性和准确性。\n\n论文中的相关例子还有很多这里就不多做列举了，如果感兴趣可以点击[论文原文](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763)进行细致了解。\n\n很显然，上文那两个所谓的相关实例都还是比较理想化的概念。**本文将于第三部分举出一些现有的比较具有代表性的相关去中心化项目，各位读者可以通过这些例子对相关内容予以把握。同时会在第四部分就上文提到的 DID 的使用、价值和发展前景进行详细的说明。**\n\n### 1.4 结论\n\n通过这篇文章大家可以预见到 Desoc 的美好未来，但同时也需要意识到 DID 只是这一远大历程中的一小步。此外，上面描述的场景只是 DeSoc 对现有项目与应用的强化作用，但是并没有涉及对比如物理、政治、社会以及它们与现实世界的复杂关系的描述，而它们实际上占据了我们现实生活的很大比例。所有这些都表明，上面描绘的远大理想，可能只是 DeSoc 最终形态的“雏形”。**论文中就 SBTs 的威胁与挑战也进行了比较细致的描述，在本文的第五部分将结合现实情况进行细致描写这里就不再细说。**\n\n# 2.  新型社交为何悄然而至\n\n### 2.1 Web2.0 传统社交弊病\n\nWeb2.0本质是平台经济，是以一小撮为代表的垄断性寡头构架，互联网在该阶段变成全民级别应用，聚集了社交、搜索、电商等超级生态应用开发，且每个行业领域龙头公司几乎垄断行业资源和发展上限，这使得Web2公司在拥有最终解释权的情况下去剥削和占有用户资源信息时游刃有余，例如微信和QQ在中国产生的影响力和不可置换性，使得用户无法维护本身利益，用户在Web2.0中更像是平台的附庸而不是服务接收者。而Web3.0是属于Token经济的后端程序革命，其本意是在为非平台内部的生态参与者获取更多的话语权和创造权，并拥有产品本身的价值支配权利，以及隐私性和安全性。一定程度的避免了不平衡的垄断机制。\n\n### 2.2 SocialFi 是 Web3.0 的必要组件\n\nSocialFi的出现是对抗传统社交平台弊端的必要产物，Web2.0 时代的社交平台被各大运营巨头控制，从用户数据中获取商业价值，忽略用户的感受。SocialFi基于区块链技术，用户身份信息的匿名性有助于保护隐私和安全，更有利于解决用户数据的确认问题以及权利下放。\n\n相信随着用户对于隐私以及自由的追求，越来越多的人会投身于Web3.0的世界，在用户渴望加密技术带给的数据主权时也渴望获得自己在这个世界独特的身份和地位。在Web2.0-3.0过渡的过程中，互联网用户需要一些中间件来从简单迁移到复杂，从而从原始空间迁移到元空间。元空间的实现需要从现有的互联网世界出发，利用一系列的Web3.0组件，分批分阶段的迎接新的用户。在尝试了Defi的去中心化资产流、NFT的数字工作价值、发现Gamefi的P2E之后，去中心化的意见发布和个人展示已经下一个需要探索和开发的Web3.0组件，在互联网发展历史中可以发现社交化可以说是网民的刚性需求。\n\n### 2.3 线上数据分析\n\n根据[Zippa](https://www.zippia.com/advice/cryptocurrency-statistics/)的统计以及交易平台和钱包的来源，2018-2020 年全球加密货币用户群增加了近 190%，2021 年进一步加速。 数据的增加可能是由于账户数量的增加以及身份识别的改进，以及在 2021 年特斯拉和万事达卡等公司宣布进军加密货世界等从热度上升带来的用户数量造成的。下图展示了Web3.0近几年来的趋势变化：         \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jov7Glf5pfabWlpkN1DD0.png?height=482&width=1141)\n\n根据Google Search数据统计，如今的互联网 2.0 使用用户约在 49.5 亿人左右，对标3亿的加密用户都还只是冰山一角。绝大多数的互联网用户都害困在传统社交网络中，让加密应用的热度扩散才是Web 3.0 走向主流用户的最关键一步。\n\n# 3. 理念的实际运用\n\n### 3.1 ENS\n\nENS”，全称 Ethereum Name Service， 是一个基于以太坊区块链的分布式，开放，可扩展的命名系统。简单来说，通过它可以把原本难以记忆的以太坊地址变成自定义的短地址。通过这种方式，人们可以轻易记下有关内容，既可以减少工作的繁琐程度，也可以减少不必要的风险。同时让用户可以通过以太坊账户和 ENS 配置文件控制自己的数字身份，不再依赖于传统的“中介”。\n\n**技术**\n\n这往往是在注册中心和解析器实现的：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KxP_2muLbCWAntIOITBtl.png?height=458&width=486)\n\nENS注册中心由一个智能合约组成，该合约维护所有域和子域的列表，并存储所有域和子域的三个关键信息：\n\n* 域的所有者\n* 域的解析器\n* 域下所有记录的缓存时间\n\nENS 注册中心作用很简单，只是为了从名称映射到负责它的解析器。解析器负责将名称转换为地址。任何有相关功能的合约都可以作为ENS中的解析器。\n\n在ENS中解析名称有两个步骤：首先，询问注册中心是哪个解析器负责该名称，其次，请该解析器回答查询。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/duhbK48dgxF77doKkPN3t.png?height=254&width=467)\n\n比如，我们试图找到\"foo. eth\"指向的以太坊地址。首先，我们询问注册中心哪个解析器负责“foo. eth”。然后，我们向解析器查询“foo. eth\"的地址。\n\n**数据**（截止至2022-05-23）\n\nDiscord关注：4万+\n\nTwitter关注：18.3万\n\n数据显示，以太坊域名服务商 ENS 在 5 月份以来的收入已经达到了 802 万美元，创下今年以来的新高。今年以来 ENS 已经累计获得了 4864 万美元的收入。\n\n**小结**\n\n通过运作流程可以看出来，整个过程并不会侵害用户的隐私，但是又为加密交易和地址记忆提供了便利条件。V神曾评论说：“ENS是迄今为止最成功的非金融类以太坊应用程序，基本可以类比为一个去中心化的电话册”。很明显它是前文所提到的 Desoc 的一个现实应用和技术支撑，随着行业的发展具有非常巨大的发展潜力。\n\n### 3.2 Bright ID\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wuZhsWQvRKNVOjwoLfTC_.png?height=609&width=1920)\n\nBrightID 是 Web3.0 用户的身份系统，基于以太坊开发，它是完全独立于传统和互联网身份认证的系统。一般用于DAPP用户验证；活动验证；信誉构建等。\n\n具有以下特点：\n\n无门槛：任何人都有权利拥有 Bright ID。\n\n隐私性：Bright ID 不会向用户索取或捕获任何个人隐私信息。\n\n开源：公共产品，完全免费且开源。\n\n**运作和验证方式**\n\nBrightID需要经过人脸和多人认证的方式来通过审核。认证结合链下会议视频等非隐私信息渠道的方式，采用视频会议的形式，由以上六位验证官负责主持验证会议并进行验证工作。验证会议的具体时间日历可在 BrightID 官网查看。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gp05mZ9Gx-tgYSiH2uGga.png?height=354&width=1280)\n\n**相关数据**\n\n融资信息\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BmJ3Z3sIoWc7xg5mA4WAk.png?height=70&width=514)\n\nMetaCartel 是一个由软件工程师、创业者以及以太坊爱好者构建的去中心化社区。他们在全球拥有600多名成员，他们具有丰富的领域经验和专业技能。已经为很多此领域最受欢迎的新兴项目提供了早期资金：Mintbase；Known Origin；Kickback；RocketNFT；Gelato Finance等。\n\n数据分析(截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注：13.2K\n\nAPP 融合：13款\n\nBright ID 用户：57K+\n\n**合作方：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySb7HH2E3tUyY-Zz9BFgX.png?height=471&width=1323)\n\n**小结**\nBrightID 在Web3.0时代扮演着很重要的角色，DAPP&APP、活动组织都采用 BrightID 进行身份验证。但这仅仅是 BrightID 潜力的一小部分，随着 BrightID 产品的迭代，以及其构建的信任网络不断扩大，将成就 BrightID 无限的可能性。\n\n### 3.3 MetaMask\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0n_GpHSQzK8HF-UjI7TT-.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nMetaMask，又或是人们口中常说的“小狐狸”钱包，日益成为加密圈内不可或缺的工具，你的钱包地址在一定程度上，可以代表你个人在链上的身份。\n\nMetaMask是一个通过web2互联网浏览器就能访问，且以低门槛与以太坊网络进行交互的工具钱包。它是Consensys目前面对终端用户的唯一产品，是以太坊最早的钱包之一，也是目前用户量最大的钱包。始于2015年，长期以网页端、免费、“半官方”的形态为大众所熟知，属于非托管型钱包。随着2020年Defi应用热潮与2021年NFT的火爆市场效应，MetaMask的用户量极速增长。2020年新增手机客户端和交易功能（名为Swap）。2021年5月推出MetaMask机构版，让机构用户能将MetaMask与机构级托管结合、方便工作流管理、易于汇报等。\n\n但起初，MetaMask其实并不是作为钱包插件之类的消费者项目，而是希望成为一种开发工具。Metamask母公司，是以太坊联合创始人Joseph Lubin所创办的区块链巨头公司之一的ConsenSys。ConsenSys 是以太坊重点项目的企业孵化器，旗下的MetaMask是ConsenSys布局的六大业务板块基础设施板块的重点项目。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YnjEZyE-akF8hkOslm1UO.png?height=188&width=839)\n\n**技术**\n\n现MetaMask已兼容绝大部分的区块链网络Dapp（包括Ethereum、Binance、Polygon），可集成托管解决方案来管理秘钥存储和多重签名批准。团队也在逐步优化产品本身，简化交易流程、减少交易费用、签字程序等。并逐步提升其合规能力，让钱包内可以进行高风险评估，安全进行去中心化和匿名交易等。\n对于大量的用户选择MetaMask作为迈入Web3的第一步，团队除了打磨好产品，提升钱包本身的安全性能，用户友好度之外。面对发展迅猛的加密货币行业，使用需求量的暴增与跨网络的需求都是不可忽视的问题。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pzMu5CxfcUo_ekJI1Ma9l.png?height=419&width=1445)\n\n**相关数据（截止到2022-05-23）**\n\n**Twitter关注**：75.4 K\n\n**融资情况**：2022-03-16，ConsenSys 完成4.5亿美元D轮融资，完成最新一轮融资后，ConsenSys的估值超过70亿美元，比2021年11月完成2亿美元C 轮融资时的估值增加一倍以上。ConsenSys首席执行官Joe Lubin在接受Decrypt采访时表示，MetaMask很快将推出DAO并发行代币。新的DAO并不会参与管理MetaMask，但将为MetaMask的更新提供资金。可见，MetaMask的资金储备是比较充足的。\n\n**其他数据**：\n\n根据公开数据，截止目前，MetaMask的月活跃用户已达到3000万。而巅峰时期的以太坊全网活跃地址也才只有 800 万左右。不难看出，Meta钱包的月活跃数量远超于此，也印证了MetaMask钱包现在已经成为了大量加密的首选。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZijDJTKGeNWtZC7Higmnt.png?height=804&width=1526)\n\n截止到2022年3月份，MetaMask插件的下载了超过1,000,000，目前日活跃用户大概在6k-8k左右，每日新用户超过2K+。目前加密货币钱包类用户早已超过8000万，对于一些出现的维护问题，团队已出现了棘手的情况。\n\n相较于互联网46亿的活跃用户来说，加密货币未来的将拥有更广阔的市场。目前MetaMask主要支持以太坊和各种EVM链，未来若想跨接到Solana等多生态，团队将如何开拓和维系其服务，值得期待。\n\n**小结**\n\n如今，MetaMask的使用已相当普及，这似乎已成为了进入Web3的第一步——生成你的去中心化钱包地址。而钱包也逐渐成为区块链世界中的一种身份象征，作为用户使用频率最高的小狐狸钱包，swap与NFT购买，是其最常用的两个功能。也因为以太坊生态中任何一个应用，都会支持MetaMask，两者的发展相辅相成，逐渐将钱包地址与Web3世界里去中心化个人身份的划上等号。\n未来，伴随着多链时代的到来，通用钱包的概念或将被逐渐被弱化，取而代之的可能是针对性更强的点对点产品服务，如专门的NFT钱包，打金钱包等。随着时间的推移，MetaMask自身以及新生代的钱包的发展都同样值得期待\n\n### 3.4 CyberConnect \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eXmS6-XLpYtKe3eZn9mQm.png?height=77&width=346)\n\nCyberconnect旨在解决社交图表（Social Graph）再分配问题，这个问题其实很好去解释，就是说Web2.0中各种平台的信息无法互通，造成重复资源浪费且难以找到各种志同道合的用户，社交图谱相对单一。\n\n而Cyberconnect所表明的内涵或者本质也很简单（用户之间的关系不仅仅是双向或者三向的，更是各种交叉和重叠的混合网络关系）例如A本身，与A关注的用户，和关注A的用户进行不同连线组合，形成一张独特的“图谱”，证明该用户的社交关系网，而从这些与用户A有联系的人又重新编织，又将形成新的图谱。这样网络世界中拥有相同的兴趣爱好的用户，同游戏玩家，商品贸易中的的买家卖家等通过社交图谱逐渐变得清晰。**如此一来，CyberConnect 便打破了不同平台之间的壁垒。**\n\n**技术**\n\n关于数据和存储：CyberConnect社交图数据存储时使用的IPFS和无许可协议Ceramic构建，联通Ceramic区块链锚定和自定义数据固定服务，可以保证CyberConnect链上数据长期存储。（使用Ceramic DID方法）关于用户数据在不同的平台如何集成，则需要采用Ceramic身份协议IDX，它为开发人员提供一个统一的界面，在CyberConnect内部查询这些数据分析，反过来CyberConnect也会给与DID链上系统提供更多的身份数据。\n\n与其它项目集成：同时CyberConnect还会与其它Web3项目集成获取信息，例如NFT平台Foundation与Rarible等，其实最重要的一点是让玩家通过一个统一的身份来参与不同种类的生态应用，同时也能与Web2链接使链上和链下数据结合起来成为更强大的去中心化数据提供商。\n\n**相关数据：**(数据截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注数：57,7k+\n\n生态项目数：30+\n\n入驻用户：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a7o2JaOaNfPgndwT2sSm3.png?height=108&width=679)\n\n融资消息：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MKRShXhLUbStaV7wGpQdV.png?height=127&width=685)\n\n其中的Multicoin曾投资过Near Protocol、Solana、Helium、Duna Analytics、Audius等潜力新兴区块链或者具有足够实际应用的优质Web3.0应用，此次Cyberconnect也正是该机构看好未来web3社交领域的潜力而开展的首次社交应用投资，证明该赛道的早期成长属性和该项目未来价值发掘。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgkZfhUF3wFkZo_i2RlCP.png?height=542&width=1145)\n\n**小结**\n\n社交化图标也是DID最核心应用场景之一。毕竟身份的重要程度随着社交功能完善等比例增长。虽然目前Cyberconnect已经接入Solana、Ethereum、Binance网络链，在用户体验感上来说，以太坊网络链是功能较完善且操作流畅，但部分操作功能在Solana上还处于开发阶段，不仅容易在网络上造成拥堵而且需要使用不同的钱包插件，使得用户体验感下降。\n\n作为一个去中心化的社交图谱协议，为Web3.0社会网络和元宇宙服务，CyberConnect还需要在前进的道路上完成更多的目标。\n\n### 3.5 Mirror\n\n提到去中心化的写作平台，大部分区块链用户都会脱口而出“Mirror”，其平台在成立不到一年就被联合广场风险投资公司估值1亿美元，获1千万美元投资。作为去中心化的写作平台赛道代表——Mirror 是依靠哪些去中心化特性和功能”荣登“宝座呢？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jylJj2d9u5m_YMYfOnvQA.png?height=601&width=865)\n\n**功能简介**\n\nMirror 跟中心化的写作平台最大的不同是，他具备加密区块链产品的特性和功能。参与用户无需通过邮箱账号，手机号码，社交帐户等中心化的身份验证手段来注册账号，只需要绑定自己的0x开头的钱包地址即可生成独一无二的“作者专栏”，类似于上文所提及的ENS（以太坊域名）。对于部分创作者来说，跟外界的接触仅仅由一串小小的字符连接，完美的融合了去中心化身份的理念。\n\n除此之外，创作者可以在Mirror平台上发布文章/创作图片等作品，每一件公开发布的作品不是保存在中心化服务器上，而是透过区块链存储专案Arweave进行链上的数据保存，经用户进行加密签名后生成一段哈希值记录，将作品永久的保存在区块链上。Mirror上更是支持创作者将自己的作品铸造成NFT，让原先没有边际成本、可被无限复制的内容作品具有稀缺性，从而被赋予价值。不仅无法被他人复制或修改，而且可以在各大NFT市场上进行售卖。\n\n其次，Mirror 也提供读者募资功能，读者喜欢的文章可以直接使用加密货币”打赏“创作者；共同的创作者可以按照设定好的盈利比例来获取各自部分的收益；以及其平台上的作品拍卖功能等等。\n\n**技术**\n\nMirror 在保存用户文章时使用的两类 Web3 组件，一个是用于对文章进行永久存储的 Arweave，另一个是用于对文章进行确权与交易的 NFT 铸造平台以太坊主网。\n\n1. Mirror 的存储组件-Arweave，是一条针对存储进行了底层性能优化的公链，因此用户在 Arweave 链上存储数据的成本相较其他智能合约公链平台有极大的降低。同时，链上存储的特征保证了在 Arweave 之上存储数据的永久性，因此，基于 Arweave 的存储模式也常被归类为永久存储。创作者在保存文章修改的时候，Mirror 会在后台自动对新的文章进行二次上链存储。\n2. Mirror 的确权组件，在存储的同时，通常会需要另一组 Web3 组件，以便对存储的内容进行确权，也就是将内容铸造为 NFT 格式的资产。但此步骤是在以太坊网络上以 NFT 的形式进行确权，成本由创作者自行承担支付。\n\n**相关数据（截至2022-05-23）**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sjq8tIDcdQka6SZ6w-cY3.png?height=71&width=699)\n\n**小结**\n\n去中心化创作平台-Mirror 的核心创新点很多，打破了传统创作平台的束缚，将NFT，社区DAO，Write-Fi相结合的经济模型，解决了部分去中心化平台所追求的“通过创作内容实现价值变现”的难题，相信 Mirror 这样肩负着去中心化任务的创作平台也会在迈向 WEB3.0 的道路上越走越远。\n\n### 3.6 Project Galaxy\n\nProject Galaxy 的愿景是想要打造一个最大的 Web3 数据凭证（credential data）网络，建造一个开放协作数据聚合基础设施，助力开发者和项目方建造更好的产品和社区。项目方在 Project Galaxy 平台上面为用户创建并奖励 NFT，用户完成项目方的任务，比如在链上进行特定的交互、参加会议、关注推特、加入 Discord 社区、提交问卷、参与测试等方式获得NFT。\n\n**技术：**\n\nProject Galaxy 目前支持两种方式来提供数据凭证 GraphQL 和 REST API。Galaxy上有两个角色，分别是数据贡献者和使用者。数据贡献者可以用子图查询或静态快照（subgraph queries or static snapshots）的方式贡献链上数据，同时在链下，Galaxy 也集成了信息来源，比如推特和 GitHub。\n\n数据使用者使用 Application module, Credential Oracle Engine, and Credential API 三种方式使用数据。并使用 Galaxy 的代币 $GAL 支付，因此数据贡献者可以获得激励。\n\n**相关数据**：\n\n已入驻项目方：400+\n\nGalaxy ID 用户：170 万+\n\nTwitter关注：30 万+\n\n融资情况：2021 年 5 月种子轮融资，2022年1月由 Multicoin Capital 和 Dragonfly Capital 领投、多个机构参投的 1000 万美元融资。随后 2 月在 CoinList 平台公募获得 1500 万美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gZN7tj9iV2lHWkssLK7Z3.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nProject Galaxy上线时间为2021年5月，运行不到一年，活跃用户量远大于同类型的项目 POAP 和 Rabbithole 。2021 年底银河女孩系列 NFT 活动让 Project Galaxy 一举成名，银河女孩 NFT 持有者更是获得了该项目原生代币 $GAL 在 CoinList 平台上公募的优先队列名额。后续 Meta Cowboy，Dr.SOL 等系列 NFT 持有者也获得了 $GAL 空投。\n\n**小结**\n\nProject Galaxy 无疑是一个非常成功的项目。链上身份凭证和数字身份一直都有市场需求，Project Galaxy 作为多链项目满足了市场在这方面的需求，为整个加密生态系统提供服务。在经历 Defi Summer 和 NFT Summer 之后 ，它抓住了 Crypto 项目方频繁使用 NFT 作为用户激励工具的需求。它给项目方提供了发放 NFT 奖励活动的工具和用户流量资源，初步形成了项目方和项目方之间，项目方和用户之间，用户和用户之间的多重网络效应。\n\n# 4. 新型社交的展望\n\n### 最初的载体与未来场景？\n\n绝大部分用户最熟悉DID理念实际运用应该是区块链钱包，例如Metamask是作为用户接入整个区块链的入口端，具有隐私性、安全性、不可追踪性。这是DID赛道最初应用成果，但是其缺点也很明确。钱包地址的注册缺少独特性，一个人可以注册大量毫无价值的钱包。其次大钱包只能显示代币难以展示NFT和参与证明等未来势必流行的资产，更不用说SBT所畅享的“无纸化”证明，这是钱包的局限性。第三钱包无法配置资产可编程属性，无法限制其他人查看钱包资产，从而导致黑客攻击情况发生。不过理念的实践是处于不断完善的过程。现在已经出现了可以展示NFT和参与证明（POA）的去中心化身份应用，还有隐私赛道对于钱包和其它DID应用进行代币隐私化、资产可视化等功能赋能等，预计不短时间内所有区块链赛道应用可以进行用户DID绑定，可记录用户等额抵押、合同签订、参与证明和哈希参数等不可篡改的数据，潜在提升单一用户DID价值\n\n从结构和理论上来阐述，有社交的地方更加注重身份特征，所以从根本属性上来说SocialFi就是实现该理念的最初赛道，只有用户们尝试并参与进来，才能够从本质上理解DID在区块链各赛道中重要程度，在未来去中心化社交领域当中，寻找相同理念思想的用户从而构建和谐关系，通过新兴匹配技术进行身份特征快速转移和整合，快速的梳理出用户兴趣爱好与社交圈，可以大程度的减少网络中诈骗行为，提高社交沟通交流效率。\n\n### 如何评估用户DID价值赋能？\n\n未来DID账号的价值根据其内部的资产总数和分配比例，如加密货币、NFT、参与证明等进行价值评估，以及个人身份信息验证，与其他用户之间互动，评论留言等进行附加属性评估。最后就是项目之间的筛选机制和会员资格评判，如拥有某些NFT或者证明的用户获得相应空投奖励、参与测试的资格等，这些都进一步的丰富了DID整体价值属性。\n\n对于目前市场来说，DID基础设施赛道仍未出现热点项目能引领该赛道的热潮，例如DeFi的火热是Uniswap带领的，GameFi的出圈前者与Axie有关，后者StepN再次引领，所以扩大潜在用户群体还需要落实到实际具体项目当中，单一可行的理念是无法吸引到足够的投资者的。\n\nDID赛道本身是没有主动生产价值的能力，创建了钱包地址不代表钱包有钱，但是从另一角度来说DID也是最能兼容区块链中所有领域的基础设施，其价值决定极大程度上基于与其它项目应用的兼容，毕竟DID属于后端程序，与个性化应用并不冲突。\n\n### 趋势预测\n\n在如今整体环境影响下，以NFT和GameFi赛道为首的炒作属性偏高的赛道整体估值下降较多，新用户和资金参与量明显下跌，而以Web 3.0等基础设施属性较强的底层架构融资情况增长。可以明确的是DID与SocialFi等赛道会长时间处于发展道路中，寻找相关实际应用和价值层次赋能，且随着未来涌入区块链赛道的用户会越来越多，下一个牛市用户数量可能会达到三到五倍的增幅，用户之间的社交属性和凭证需求会随着用户数等比例增长，所以目前早期部署该赛道，其未来潜力也是无法估量的。\n\n# 5. DID 与 SocialFi 发展过程中可能的挑战\n\nDID 赛道 和 SocialFi 目前处于早期探索阶段，有着巨大的发展前景，隐藏着许多仍未被发掘的机会，但同时也有着不少问题等待 Web3 建设者们去挑战：\n\n* 不可转让这一概念本身就存在着技术上的挑战，在限制或防止转移的需求和区块链生态系统之间有着难以跨越的障碍，因为目前来说，几乎所有的项目标准都是围绕着最大可转移性来设计的。\n* 隐私是此类生态系统良好运作的一个重要前提。许多情况下，用户并不希望透露他们所有的身份信息。去中心化的身份信息如何做到仅在必要的时候披露给必要的对象，也是在技术上所面临的一大挑战。\n\n一个只规范资本而不规范人类个人行为的制度可能只会无情地服务于金钱而非人类本身。我们作为 Web3 的参与者和建设者，需要更多的思考和更多的努力来解决这些挑战。而如果我们能够成功解决，则为区块链那些并非只关注金钱的生态系统，打开了一扇通往更为广阔天地的大门。\n\n## 参考资料\n\n1.

Overuse of chemicals in the manufacturing process, the use of uncertified chemicals and mechanisms for preservation and maturing processes are main issues affecting the quality of agricultural goods as well as the overall health of consumers. Consequently, consumers increasingly want healthier foods with simple ingredients and certified organic status. However, the organic food industry is facing an existential crisis. Consumers are worried that the food they are eating is truly organic.\n\nOver the years, there have been several fraud cases of organic food where non-organic products tricked consumers by misleading them under a particular label, imported ingredients, or privately making financial arrangements. While several certifying bodies certify a farm for producing organic products, it does not assure that a particular food product is 100 per cent organic (Verified Organic, 2020). The growing skepticism is stagnating consumer confidence worldwide, but **what if the entire food chain could be placed on a “trust-less” platform where transactions are transparent, traceable, tamper-evident, immutable and compliant?**\n\nMechanisms to classify agricultural products’ quality are highly requested due to the lack of accountability in the current supply-chain process. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that offers the much-required traceability and transparency in an otherwise complex food supply chain by preventing fraudulence and ensuring the authenticity of products to consumers. Besides capturing data at every point within the supply chain ecosystem, a cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) powered Blockchain system also ensures that it’s shared amongst every supply chain participant, including farmer, manufacturer, supplier, distributor, and consumer (Sofocle Technologies, 2020). For stakeholders in the food supply chain, having traceability and transparency will build better relationships with their customers, increases efficiency, and reduces the risk and cost of food recalls, fraud, and product loss (Bumblauskas, Mann, Dugan & Rittmer, 2020).\n\n## **Outbreaks**\n\nFurthermore, considering the current Covid-19 pandemic scenario, traceability along the supply chain is vital. When an outbreak of food tampering or disease occurs, it can take days, if not weeks, to find its source. For instance, in 2018, at least 18 reported outbreaks of foodborne illnesses in the USA, including the E. coli found in romaine lettuce. If investigators cannot point to a specific farm or farms, the government usually advises consumers to avoid products grown in a particular area (as in the case of romaine lettuce from Yuma, Arizona), or even avoid the good altogether. According to Walmart, millions of bags or heads of lettuce had to be removed, and consumers lost confidence in romaine lettuce entirely (Walmart, 2018). Better traceability could help save lives by allowing companies to act faster and protect farmers’ livelihoods by only discarding produce from the affected farms.\n\nToday, major corporations such as Walmart, Starbucks, and Nestlé are executing blockchain programs. For example, to validate the framework, Walmart, along with its technology partner IBM, ran two proof of concept projects. One initiative was to trace mangos sold in Walmart’s US stores and the other was to trace pork sold in its Chinese stores. The blockchain-based food traceability system worked. It allowed the upload of certificates of authenticity to the blockchain for pork in China, adding more trust and confidence to a system where it used to be a severe problem, and for mangoes in the US, the time needed to trace their provenance went from 7 days to 2.2 seconds (Hyperledger, 2019).\n\n## Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) making it accessible.\n\nWith big players announcing blockchain programs, it is easy to assume this technology requires massive capital expenditures. Nevertheless, blockchain technologies have risen exponentially over the last years and are now available through numerous Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) delivery models. This means, there is no expensive infrastructure to purchase or upgrade as Walmart did back in 2018. BaaS platforms only require a device with an internet browser and easily integrate with existing supply chain management systems. With little deployment time or expense needed, these subscription-based, out-of-the-box systems are ready to launch. An outstanding example of Blockchain BaaS success is Ruby Rockets’ frozen snack brand’s work in its supply chain. The company is committed to using only organic or natural fruits and vegetables in its nutritious snack foods. Ruby Rockets implemented a BaaS solution to support this commitment, integrating the platform with its existing accounting system, purchase orders, inventory management system, and online shop. In fewer than 90 days, Ruby Rockets had a system to track products upstream and downstream. Now, the company can rapidly trace ingredient origins and log processing information, ensuring product integrity backed by data on the distributed ledger, ensuring a “USDA-Certified 100-Percent Organic” label (Pratik, 2020)\n\n## Verdict\n\nIt is clear that the long-term benefits and opportunities in applying blockchain technologies to business operations are undeniable. Opening a traceable, transparent supply chain to shoppers is an effective way of building consumer trust and may help the brand stand out against competition at the point of sale. A commitment of this innovative nature would improve operational efficiency, increase revenue, and position a brand image with high corporate social responsibility. Indeed, as blockchain technology adoption rises among farmers, suppliers, and food manufacturers, the organic food supply chain will only strengthen, which means healthier food and beverages for consumers today and a sustainable future for tomorrow.\n\n**References:**\n\nDaniel Bumblauskas, Arti Mann, Brett Dugan & Jacy Rittmer.

{"id": "Sj99zfmZBhQ_9xl5UuoicfcSNFDgU7pb04_LdYWtlOU", "title": "Why Dark Forest Matters: A Good Game, not a Crypto Game", "body": "[Dark Forest](https://zkga.me/) is a massively multiplayer (MMO) real-time strategy (RTS) game in closed beta. If you like strategy games, you should play it. Anyone who is a fan of games like Sins of a Solar Empire, Factorio, or Civilization should *definitely* play it. It’s not a game with global appeal like Super Mario Odyssey, but it doesn’t need to be nor try to be.\n\nPersonally, it's the best new game I’ve played in 2022. When I got off the waitlist I played it for 10 hours straight -- that’s why I’m writing this post. It’s the most exciting strategy game I’ve played since StarCraft 2. It’s the most exciting competitive multiplayer game I’ve played since Valorant. And it’s renewed my optimism for the potential of web3 games. Why? It gets many things right, but it gets a few things very, very right:\n\n* It is a refreshing take on a stale genre\n* It has a competitive ladder with a fresh take on ranking\n* It’s plugin system & open source codebase brings modding back to games\n* It shakes up assumptions around the infrastructure costs of online multiplayer games\n* It has a thoughtful team that closely engages with the community\n\nIntrigued? Great, read on! But there is one minor detail you might care to know… Dark Forest runs on “The Blockchain”.\n\n### Blockchains, Monetization, and Games\n\nBlockchains and cryptocurrencies are a divisive topic in recent times, but especially so in the gaming community. Initial promises of a cross-platform utopia with transferable skins and items quickly gave way to a wave of “crypto games” with [terrible monetization schemes](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/08/axie-infinity-reduces-slp-emissions-to-prevent-collapse/) and [high profile hacks](https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolf-game-highlights-challenges-of-nft-game-development). These, along with other narratives around the most popular blockchains using energy-guzzling Proof of Work algorithms and NFTs destroying the environment, have poisoned the well for any game touting blockchain-adjacent features.\n\nThe negative reaction from the gaming community to companies adding blockchain features, like [Discord teasing an Ethereum integration](https://cointelegraph.com/news/discord-community-splits-as-ceo-unveils-pre-released-ethereum-integration), makes sense! The cut runs deeper and older than crypto gaming’s recent spotlight – it triggers all-too-fresh memories of the gaming industry's parlous relationship with new types of monetization. The sting of in-game ads, base game content behind paid DLC, and hellish microtransaction models is still felt in the community. And while some developers, like [the SW: Battlefront 2 devs, had a change of heart](https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/star-wars-battlefront-ii-microtransactions-removed-after-fan-boycott-a3693736.html), it’s been a rocky journey. [Misguided attempts to win over players](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/) notwithstanding, the community still finds itself with games like [The Sims 4](https://gamerant.com/the-sims-4-kits-microtransactions-price-why/) offering $800 of paid DLC.\n\n![This legendary comment by an EA community team member is the most downvoted comment in the history of Reddit.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lhUJ5IJZCc9DTbi0UnYK6.png?height=190&width=1432)\n\nThe good news is that Dark Forest is not trying to sell you anything, nor is it an abusively monetized game. It is a great game that just happens to use new technology in cryptography and blockchains to their advantage, rather than shoehorn them in.\n\nIt also isn’t funded through venture capital, instead relying on community and non-profit funding sources. So [don’t worry Jack](https://fortune.com/2021/12/23/web3-elon-musk-marc-andreessen-jack-dorsey-twitter-fight/), [no a16z or VCs on their GitCoin page](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2323/dark-forest) or [funding page](https://0xparc.org/about)! Raising venture capital is fine (I’ve done it!), but in this case the developers truly have put the game and the community first.\n\n### About Me\n\nYou can skip this part if you just want to read about Dark Forest; it just contextualizes my motivation.\n\nI’m a huge gamer (hello, fellow kids!). I’ve religiously grinded the online competitive ladders of StarCraft 2, [League of Legends](https://na.op.gg/summoners/na/prostyler), and [Valorant](https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/Prostyler%23NA1/overview). You can [stat check my Steam profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/omarziprostyle/) if you want to know more about my tastes.\n\nI’m also [a developer and a founder](https://www.omarmezenner.com/) in the web3 space. I think I’m in a unique position to speak about the web3 gaming experience. I know a lot more needs to be delivered before reasonable skeptics can see past crypto’s current failings. I’m an optimist that believes eventually cryptography and web3 tech can re-empower users on web platforms, and I’m trying to build that reality.\n\nAnd if you don’t believe me, again, check my gaming habits! I promise Axie Infinity is nowhere to be found in [my wallet](https://rainbow.me/omarmezenner.eth). I did spend a month as a child catching all 150 Pokemon in the original games with a[ link cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Link_Cable), 2 Gameboys, and the holy trinity of Red / Blue / Yellow versions. I’ve got no on-chain proof for that, though… only PTSD of the Safari Zone….\n\n![Wasn't stoning a punishment in the Bible and Quran? Why would these animals ever be your pet?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NiBlJKyuT5-PFQyE157fC.png?height=360&width=1440)\n\n### A Quick Overview of Dark Forest\n\nDark Forest is a browser-based 2.5D (2D plane, 3D assets) game that takes place in “rounds”, with each round lasting a few days (the current round is underway and will last 10 days). If the following in-game image makes your eyes bleed, the gameplay might still make you stay!\n\n![An overview of my quaint civilization. And no, I won't ever activate Windows.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1ygHpDmmYZ9W66vhpJF7D.png?height=808&width=1600)\n\nGenerally, a few months pass between rounds, which players use to plan for the next round. The current round in February preceded by one last year in October, and game mechanics are added between rounds. While a round is underway, players try to earn the highest score on the leaderboard, viewable in [real-time on the homepage](https://zkga.me/). (Yeah, I’m not doing too hot. And yeah, [the CEO of Figma](https://twitter.com/zoink) won the first round). The top ranked 63 players at the end of a round get a reward from the devs, but otherwise you just play for fun.\n\nThe core game loop is:\n\n* All players spawn with a home planet and vision over a small area in their corner of the universe, with fog of war (i.e. no vision) covering the map\n* Planets have energy that regenerates over time\n* You send energy from your planets to other planets to conquer them\n* Some planets have “silver” and “artifacts” which give you points that determine your rank\n* You break the fog of war with an “explorer” whose speed is dictated by the compute power of the real life, physical computer you’re playing on\n\nIf it all sounded great until that last point, hear me out. No, this isn’t some shadow-realm version of [Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boktai:_The_Sun_Is_in_Your_Hand) where you destroy the environment to play. Nor is the game pay-to-win. Nor is it using [your browser to mine Monero](https://coingeek.com/in-browser-monero-mining-service-coinhive-to-shut-down-operations/).\n\nFirst, AFAICT the game’s miner seems to have fairly limited scaling capability, with a [Raspberry Pi giving reasonable performance](https://github.com/projectsophon/darkforest-rs/tree/main/mimc-fast) (1-2k hashes/sec is roughly equivalent to my browser using a Ryzen 3600 XT & 2 cores). On the backend the game runs on the [Gnosis Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/) (an Ethereum sidechain — don’t worry if this means nothing to you for now), which is Proof of Stake, not Proof of Work. Shadow-realm Hideo Kojima still has a game to make.\n\nSecond, yes – faster computers have an advantage. It’s not as big as you’d think (running on 16 cores vs 2 cores is \\~2.5x better, and 16 vs 4 is \\~1.7x, so diminishing returns kick in). The bigger advantage comes from using a “remote hasher”, which is a separate server that does hashing. But in the early game, you’re mostly limited by your strategy, not the fog of war. In the mid-game, players need to direct their explorer’s search regardless of how much compute they have. If I were to make an analogy to other competitive online games, having a large amount of compute would be like playing a First-Person Shooter a la CS:GO or Valorant with a 240 Hz monitor and a low-latency connection. It makes a difference, but anyone can upgrade their gear to be at their competitive best. You can still have fun and be competitive without top gear.\n\nThird, if you’re afraid the game might be using your computer for nefarious purposes, it’s all open source (both the [code ](https://github.com/darkforest-eth)and the live smart contracts and frontend). If you don’t have the skill to audit it, then yes, you’ll have to trust a friend or someone else to do it for you. When I quickly read through it, it looked good, promise. You won’t be sending any excellent privacy coins to anyone.\n\n(That last part was a joke, please don’t buy or mine Monero if you’re trying to make a quick buck.)\n\nThere are other mechanics like upgrading planets, a planet leveling system (you progressively conquer larger planets as you expand), and “artifacts” that boost your planets’ creation of energy and other resources. These feel natural and are staples of any good strategy game, but the tech tree is less developed than the richness of a Civilization entry, and there isn’t customization on the level of Stellaris.\n\nWhat Dark Forest lacks in more traditional strategy game features it makes up for in competitive Player vs Player (PvP) design, though.\n\n### Competition in Dark Forest\n\nDark Forest’s ladder and competitive rewards are sort of similar to other online games like League of Legends. There’s a publicly viewable leaderboard and end-of-season ranked rewards. What’s unique about Dark Forest’s leaderboard is that the game doesn’t use an “Elo system” or feature any skill-based matchmaking at all, which is a departure from the most popular competitive games today. Instead, all players compete with all other players within a round. This may not seem like it sets up the average player for a good time, but we’ll touch on how this doesn’t lead to new players getting Goomba stomped by more skilled ones.\n\nPlayers earn points by interacting with the game universe – either discovering “artifacts” on conquered planets, or exchanging “silver” for points. Players interact with other players’ planets using the same moves as they would an unconquered planet. The only difference is that players can beef up their planets’ defense so it requires more energy to capture. So rather than a “Player vs. Environment” (PvE) MMO experience, the resources themselves are a battleground for “Player vs. Player” (PvP) gameplay.\n\nNote that the exact competitive mechanics change between rounds, for e.g. there has also been a [“race to the center”](https://blog.zkga.me/v6-r3-wrapup) round, which keeps the game fresh.\n\nThis is where the titular mechanic of “a dark forest” comes in. Since there are finite resources and you expand to the edges of your fog of war, you might think that you must “tread without sound” while exploring the universe. I.e. you should avoid other players. Hey, you’d be in good company, sci-fi [author Liu Cixin](https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/the-dark-forest-theory-a-terrifying-explanation-of-why-we-havent-heard-from-aliens-yet/) thought that, and he inspired the game!\n\nSurely you wouldn’t want to discover a player more advanced than you, with more planets and energy, and have them conquer you. And on the flipside, if you encountered a less progressed player you’d crush them under your thumb!\n\nIt turns out, it’s not that simple.\n\n### Strategy in Dark Forest\n\nThe multiplayer metagame is where the strength of Dark Forest’s game design emerges. The current round of the game offers a few interesting levers to reign in more progressed players and generate more sophisticated strategies than “more planets = more energy = me strong!!”. (Note again that these mechanics and the win conditions change from round to round. There’s a good [write-up of a previous round’s strategy](https://blog.zkga.me/the-art-of-dark-forest-war)).\n\nFirst, engaging with similarly progressed players is encouraged through a “junk” cap on how many planets you have conquered. This is similar to “population” in StarCraft, except, sorry, you can’t [construct additional pylons here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCysnsJ4XUA)! Your junk limit is fixed at the start of the round, and each planet comes with junk if it’s unoccupied. I.e., players are incentivized to take already-conquered planets since they’re free of junk. Otherwise players must abandon old, smaller planets to free their junk limit and expand. Since smaller conquered planets typically have their silver and artifacts removed, this mainly pushes similarly progressed players to war over conquered-but-unmined planets.\n\nSecond, actions take time to perform. No, not because there’s a lot of clicking (there is, but more on automation with the plugin system in a bit). Once you decide to send a resource – energy, silver, artifacts, or ships – to another planet, actually sending that resource takes real world time proportional to the distance it must travel. In the early game, this is on the order of a few dozen seconds. In the mid-game, this turns into tens of minutes! There’s no worse feeling than knowing you’ve executed a poor game plan while there’s still 20 minutes before your stuff has arrived. The high latency between actions and outcomes rewards sophisticated planners and not the ones with the highest actions per minute APM ([sorry MarineKing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFmq-Q_ObdQ), this one ain’t for you).\n\nThird, there is a “Broadcast” mechanic that allows a player to reveal the location of a planet through the fog of war, *whether owned or unowned by them,* every few hours. This leads to emergent meta-strategies around large resources. Need a bit of help to make sure a nearby expanding neighbor has to worry about multiple encroaching players? If you’re ranked 64 and 65, why not join forces if you stumble upon a top-63 player?\n\nFourth, taking an action costs real-world money. Don’t worry, I won’t be shilling a shitcoin and I’ll explain what the payment stuff is like next. The important thing to know is that choosing the *right* action matters, because you’re wasting money otherwise.\n\n### “Aha there is money involved! I won’t be buying your shitcoin!”\n\nYes, you have to pay to play Dark Forest. But you pay in a USD stablecoin (xDai) so the price doesn’t fluctuate and you aren’t pumping some trending coin on Twitter. For the current round one action (e.g. sending energy to a planet) costs $0.002 (2/10ths of a cent). I paid \\~$0.50 to play for ten hours but it’ll depend on your gameplay. All players received $0.15 at the start of the round from the devs. I put $10 into my wallet to play when that ran out.\n\nThe money you pay doesn’t go back to the devs – it’s a “gas fee” you pay to save your action to the network (in this case, an Ethereum sidechain called the [Gnosis Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/), formerly the xDai Chain).\n\nIf you enjoy the game, you can buy in-game hats to support the devs. Yes, hats, like the kind on your head or in Team Fortress 2. I bought a Fez hat for one of my planets for $1\n\n![Cute, right?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PKmN71OAhnsBmnzDk5UW8.png?height=490&width=507)\n\nWas it worth it? Hey –[ I report, you decide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News#Slogan).\n\n### A Side Note on Play-to-Earn (P2E)\n\n“Ugh… it’s crypto, just tell me how to make money playing this…” is probably what you’re thinking. Again, I’m not hiding anything – you really don’t make money playing Dark Forest. You really do have to enjoy it and find it worth paying to play.\n\nDark Forest is not play-to-earn (P2E) like other crypto games (e.g. [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/)) are. The top ranked 63 players at the end of a round do get an NFT prize. Since it’s an NFT, it can be sold like any other NFT on the Ethereum network. It’s my understanding that in some previous early releases, the top players got a cash prize (paid in USD-equivalent crypto tokens), but this was a small amount ($1,000 pool).\n\nBefore you claim “NFT trading? that’s P2E!” I would ask you to think hard about what P2E means. The NFTs you earn after a round of Dark Forest are akin to an end-of-season reward on a competitive game’s ranked ladder. They’re a personal achievement. Is League of Legends P2E because you can sell a Challenger-tier (the highest competitive ranking) account for[ a few hundred dollars](https://www.playerauctions.com/lol-account/challenger/)? While most players with a challenger account would be proud of their rank and never think to resell, some people really do make a living flipping high ranked accounts. E.g. a top ranked Korean League of Legends player, “Dopa”,[ has been banned from competitive play in Riot’s professional league for selling his high-ranked accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4b2cyj/dopa_apdo_has_been_banned_by_riot_korea/).\n\nPersonally, I think a variation of P2E is inevitable in online games, like the freemium model before it. Dedicated player communities generate a lot of value for a game, whether through streaming, professional play, community art & music, guides, or other content. It’s up to publishers to figure out how best to craft the experience. Even Riot bootstrapped their professional scene by paying $25k/year salaries to players early on! That’s P2E! Just for a small subset of very skilled players.\n\nIf you still think Dark Forest and all games with secondary economies are P2E then sure, you can snip this section, add it to [web3isgoinggreat.com](https://web3isgoinggreat.com) and dunk me on your social media platform of choice! I’m making an argument of degree (the play-to-earn moniker depends on how a game is monetized and the player experience; just as a game with real-money items is not necessarily pay-to-win). You’re making an argument of kind (players making money off of a game makes it P2E). We fundamentally disagree on the definition of that phrase and you can evaluate whether Dark Forest is still worth playing on other terms.\n\n### Plugins & Programmability\n\nPlugins are probably the single biggest feature I’m excited to spend “playtime” on in Dark Forest. Plugins let you write short Javascript programs to manipulate the game. You [can find a list of them here](https://plugins.zkga.me/), and they range anywhere from “show an outline around my planets” to “automatically conquer all planets fitting these criteria around a center point”.\n\n![Copy-pasting 200 lines of Javascript gave me a nice little slider to find my planets on the map! It ain’t much but it’s honest gaming](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LE2rTuC9fGbSdMySRAiQQ.png?height=449&width=691)\n\nBy my estimation, most of the top players in Dark Forest have automated the bulk of their gameplay via plugins or writing programs that interact with the game’s backend directly. After playing for 10 hours, I only had 300,005 points, whereas other players had 2500x as much, despite only playing for 4 more days. Rewards aren’t linear with game time but they don’t scale *that* aggressively AFAICT.\n\nYou might be thinking “wait, if it can automate game actions… and this is browser based… isn’t that like cheating? And how does the game stop people from cheating? Isn’t the blockchain public? Can’t shadowy super coders data mine where I am?”.\n\nThis is the coolest part about how Dark Forest is built. How can the game 1) run in a browser, 2) on a public blockchain, 3) allow modding, but 4) have no cheating? (Ok, there are [bugs](https://blog.zkga.me/artifact-minting-exploit) - that’s not the same).\n\nIt’s because the player actions are encoded with something called “[Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://blog.zkga.me/df-init-circuit)”. Yes, I can see your eyes glaze over – don’t worry, I’ve saved the nerdy stuff for the next section on blockchain & cryptography. The point is, even though your actions  are recorded on a public blockchain, they’re hidden with a kind of cryptographically-secured game engine. So while you can automate your own actions, you can’t do more than “click faster” with automation --  the game’s backend can verify that the moves you submit must be legal and protects itself from denial of service attacks. And even with automation, you *still* need a guiding strategy to effectively compete with other players.\n\nThe other benefit of the game’s backend and state being public on-chain is that *other* games can plug into the Dark Forest ecosystem. Without having to construct a formal agreement with the Dark Forest team! This is equivalent to an open API, similar to Riot’s API for it’s titles, and is often referred to as “composability” in web3 parlance. If you’ve ever played an online game where your Twitch Prime subscription unlocks items or skins, a la Epic’s Fortnite or Riot’s Valorant, this effectively allows for that same experience but for any developer, without API rate limits, and unconstrained to the limited features the publisher exposes.\n\nAnd this goes beyond extending the game’s capabilities -- since users are on-chain addresses, player guilds (in MMOs, guild are groups of allied players) can be formulated as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). [Guilds can then re-appropriate tools to vote for on decisions](https://mirror.xyz/wbarobinson.eth/wBckyakVfD4op3eO0a0viWvwoNsm4YfvCKQ-JBfg5d4)! No more spamming in-game guild chat or impersonating players on private guild forums! [Will Robinson](https://mirror.xyz/wbarobinson.eth) has a full series on his experience as part of a Dark Forest guild.\n\n### Whatever Happened to Mods, Anyway?\n\nThis brings us to a more general point about mods. With all of the cool stuff you can build using mods, why is it so rare to find a rich mod framework for any new games, much less a multiplayer game these days? Well, for multiplayer games it makes sense, developers don’t want yet another vector of cheating or other more subtle competitive advantages. Riot has a [thorough third party application policy for their games](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848-Third-Party-Applications#:\\~:text=Riot's%20Stance&text=Third%2Dparty%20applications%20are%20programs,that%20provide%20measurable%20player%20advantage.). Hell, they’ve been [criticized for installing “a rootkit” on players’ computers](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/g02ggb/valorant_anticheat_starts_upon_computer_boot_and/) to ensure Valorant has an impeccable anti-cheat system (it works well btw, no complaints from me).\n\nBut in giving up mods, I think the gaming community has lost out on an immeasurably large amount of rich new gaming experiences. Seriously, this isn’t hyperbole – it’s a hard counterfactual to prove, but the history of modding makes a strong case. Sure, [Skyrim mods](https://www.pcgamer.com/best-skyrim-special-edition-mods/) are amazing and add cool stuff. But the most revelatory story is the birth of League of Legends, DOTA, and the MOBA genre.\n\nDOTA and League of Legends came from a [series of mods of Warcraft 3, notably DOTA: All Stars by a developer named Guinsoo](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-08-16-the-story-of-dota-article). The mod was eventually passed on to another, pseudonymous developer named IceFrog. Guinsoo eventually went on to work at Riot Games on League of Legends and IceFrog went to work at Valve on Dota 2. Today Riot’s League of Legends boasts [180 million monthly players](https://www.pcgamer.com/with-180-million-players-league-of-legends-games-have-more-active-users-than-steam/) and [more than a billion in revenue](https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-lol-revenue/report-league-of-legends-produced-1-75-billion-in-revenue-in-2020-idUSFLM2vzDZL). It’s at the vanguard of the esports scene with hundreds of professional players globally. And it all started from a mod and some pseudonymous devs circa 2005!\n\nThe ironic, unfortunate thing is that Dota 2 and League of Legends don’t have mods. Players are still creative – the popular “All Random All Mid (ARAM)” mode in League of Legends started as an unofficial custom game format in the community before getting productized. What new phenoms would we have if these games turned themselves into true platforms?\n\n### Blockchains for Free Game Backends\n\nAll of the prior stuff may have you excited, but still wondering “...so why is this built on that Big Bad Blockchain thing again? I’d like my earthly oceans unboiled, thank you.” I’ll go deeper here. Fair warning this is going to get nerdy.\n\nFirst, the game runs on the [Gnosis Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/) which is Proof of Stake. No boiling oceans here! If you don’t know what that means, instead of crunching numbers (Proof of Work), the network is secured by people dumping a million bucks onto a computer in the form of tokens and saying “I won’t lie, fingers crossed winky face!\\~ Oh but if I do then you get to take all my money!\\~”. The network is Ethereum-compatible so when Ethereum swaps over to Proof of Stake, the game may move off of this sidechain. It doesn’t really matter to players either way.\n\nSecond, the game’s designed to run on basically no developer-owned servers. The game logic runs only on players’ machines and the Gnosis blockchain. Turns out the devs ain’t paying the infrastructure bills because they don’t have any. They do have some nominal bills for their website I’m sure, but the actual backend logic that you’d normally have to run in a data center isn’t costing them anything. $0.\n\nConcurrent interacting players is something MMOs normally struggle with, because it’s a hard problem (you have to resolve O(N^2) player interactions for N players). Developers use tricks to get around this like having small zones, making some actions unimportant like player collision, and splitting playerbases into different instances. Dark Forest is no different -- blockchains don’t have high throughput. The game’s use of “[Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://blog.zkga.me/df-init-circuit)” (ZKPs) affords them a clever workaround. We’ll touch on these more in the next sections, but the main problem here is that Dark Forest must support many concurrent players within a round, but they can’t validate every little interaction a player makes like a real-time MMO a la World of Warcraft does.\n\nServer costs are real, ask any developer that supports a few thousand players! Even [a simple Minecraft server with 20 players can you a few thousand in initial setup costs](https://www.servermania.com/kb/articles/how-much-does-a-minecraft-server-cost/#:\\~:text=A%20server%20for%2020%20players,to%20run%20the%20Minecraft%20server.) and a few dozen in recurring costs. And this will scale up, depending on how many players you want to support. Dark Forest elegantly skirts recurring infrastructure costs via it’s game design and using a blockchain for it’s backend.\n\nIn a communication with the Dark Forest dev team, they told me they spent more on Github than they did on any cloud costs (e.g. their blog/static site)! And this won’t suddenly start going up when they scale to more than a few hundred players!\n\n### Cutting-edge Cryptography For Secure Game Frontends\n\nIf you’re a security-minded developer there’ve probably been some alarm bells going off in your head. Maybe akin to, “the game accepts actions client-side… in a web browser… this guy is fucking clown. Why have I read this far?”. Hold on. To explain how the game accepts rich actions executed in a player’s browser without cheating, we need to touch on [Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://blog.zkga.me/df-init-circuit) (ZKPs).\n\nEvery action a player takes in Dark Forest produces a ZKP (a string of bits that follow some cryptographic properties). The ZKP is submitted to the game’s backend, where it’s cryptographically verified to have followed the game’s logic. This allows for richer actions to be taken client-side  without having a ton of chatter between front- and backends of the game. Here’s how it works in practice:\n\nFirst, a ZKP lets another computer verify that a *specific kind of computation* was performed. In particular, when constructing a ZKP, a computation must match a pre-specified boolean logic circuit. For example, you can produce a ZKP of an addition of two binary numbers.  This is the “proof” part of a ZKP. This lets each player run rich logic for their gameplay client-side, instead of sending individual inputs or commands to a central server that validates each command separately.\n\nIn the case of Dark Forest, game logic includes things like checking whether sending energy to another planet is valid by ensuring the target planet’s location falls within a certain valid radius. [The developers wrote a blog post that goes into more detail about their ZKP circuits](https://blog.zkga.me/df-init-circuit).\n\nSecond, the ZKP does not reveal *any other information* about the computation. Seriously, nothing else. Not the inputs. Not the outputs. For example, you can prove you’ve calculated w=(x+y)\\*z without telling me what w, x, y, z or the answer are. This is the “zero knowledge” part of a ZKP. The backend verifies the client’s ZKP to ensure it was valid.\n\nYes, this is mind-melting.\n\nThe combination of a decentralized database (here, a public blockchain that stores the game state but that can’t process a ton of real-time simple inputs) and decentralized compute (ZKPs created in players’ web browsers) lets the game run in a performant manner, without cheating, and with mods.\n\nThat’s the magic behind how Dark Forest works.\n\nIn case this isn’t quite clicking & you’re a curious developer, I recommend [this repo of Battleship done via ZKPs](https://github.com/kunalmodi/battlesnark) by [Kunal Modi](https://twitter.com/kunal_modi), a colleague from South Park Commons. He also [has a write-up](https://kunalm.xyz/posts/zksnark-battleship.html).\n\n![A quick demo of how you could decentralize a multi-player Battleship](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/phH7dV3rXVI98JH9h2XWm.png?height=641&width=1500)\n\nI had another paragraph here explaining ZKPs with an analogy of a computer crunching numbers and how only you, as the chef of those crunchy numbers, could appreciate them. I axed it. No crunchy numbers today.\n\nSigh… math seems cool until you have to learn it well enough to teach it…\n\n### Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Zero-Context Buzzwords\n\nDoes this sound *too* magical? A little *too* good to be true? Wouldn’t ZKPs solve a few *other* privacy problems? Maybe they could put an end to those annoying cookie banner ads? Why don’t all multiplayer games use them to prevent cheating? In fact, shouldn’t these things be used everywhere? At least for a few other useful things? Maybe [proving that Berenstein Bears is really spelled Berenstain Bears](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-people-have-such-strong-feelings-about-the-spelling-of-the-berenstain-bears)?\n\nThe truth is, they’re legitimately new technology. Not new as in “Gee willikers, that internet thing is new!”. New as in the compilers and software to create ZKP circuits [are 2 years old at the time of writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof#Zero-Knowledge_Proof_Protocols). Sorry, #TeamBerenstAin – the past is the past but the future can still be saved.\n\nThe price of casting a spell with this arcane, dark magick technology is… computations take a really really long time. Like, *seconds* to do basic stuff like arithmetic, even on today’s hardware. If you can write code, try to go through a [SnarkJS ](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)or [Circom ](https://github.com/iden3/circom)tutorial or run a sample app. I instrumented & ran [this repo of Battleship done via ZKPs](https://github.com/kunalmodi/battlesnark) so you can see for yourself.\n\n![A few seconds to make a few moves in Battleship, oof](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TT9KnBh70FIQxe9dcp3g8.png?height=246&width=1050)\n\nZKPs are slow. Devs needs to be clever about their usage. Imagine if adding a few numbers took a few seconds. We’d be back like 100 years in terms of compute power? Yikes.\n\nYet that’s the price you pay if you want a massively multiplayer game that can run on player machines without cheating, at no marginal infrastructure cost to the developers.\n\nIt’s good news! Culture isn’t stuck and the internet isn’t dead. Yaaaay! Ok so it’s slow, but we can make new hardware and software to make it fast. And things will get better, not just for games, but for all types of privacy-preserving applications. No one needs to shill Monero any more, woot woo (kidding, no one knows what Monero is any more)!\n\n### The Team is Obviously Good\n\nRemember my planet with the fez hat? Dark Forest using hats to monetize is a proof-point for how the development team is made of passionate gamers. Yes, it’s an in-joke that references another game that only some will understand. Even if you don’t understand the joke, it’s a signal that the team is not a fan of “pay-to-win” mechanics. This is despite the frothy market for such mechanics in existing games, crypto or not (enjoy paying for another [DLC season pass](https://www.pcgamesn.com/dear-everyone-its-time-to-stop-buying-season-passes-at-launch) for a $60 AAA game or buying your first Axie! Ok, Axie prices seem to have gone down, but I’m still not playing.).\n\nYou can also read their [blog ](https://blog.zkga.me/)to find plenty of community-oriented educational content. Not just on game design decisions! They’re also bringing the cutting edge, dark magic whose mere utterance turns an anonymous Twitter anime profile-pic goon into an S-tier technologi– ok I’ll stop. They’re making Zero Knowledge Proofs more accessible to the broader software development community. Yes, you can cynically say “that's just content marketing for recruiting!” But it’s still great educational content! Plenty of tech companies have useful write-ups on their blogs. I benefitted greatly from them as a young engineer in Silicon Valley! And again, the team’s funded via donations and grants – check[ their funding page](https://0xparc.org/about) or [their Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2323/dark-forest). No implicit growth mandate! Yaaaay [regenerative economics](https://capitalinstitute.org/8-principles-regenerative-economy/).\n\nAside from blog content, there was an IRL meet-up at ETHDenver (which in dramatic irony I didn’t attend since 1) I just received my beta key, but 2) I had to fly to ETHDenver!). The team is active on their Discord. The pace of development and beta access shows they’d rather craft a great game for a few hundred players and make sure it can scale up before showing it to everyone.\n\nThere’s a famous Shigeru Miyamoto quote about how [ “a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad”](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/apr/27/shigeru-miyamoto-rushed-game-forever-bad). You may believe the quote is outdated since we’re in a world of online-connected games. Weekly or monthly patches that adjust gameplay are common. Hell, Riot practically re-released League of Legends 3 times with all of the visual and gameplay updates they shipped over the past 10 years! Surely a development team can launch early and fix a game based on player feedback – that’s the Lean Startup way!\n\n![Small batch & handmade – we like our games like we do our ice cream.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kOjHtbGRbGBwYED9ObzUn.png?height=512&width=1200)\n\n([Here’s the above ice cream recipe, btw](https://buttermilkbysam.com/easy-homemade-1-pint-ice-cream/).)\n\nThere are subtleties and limits to the iterative approach of building products, games included, that make it hard for teams to get right. Development teams (even at mature, successful companies) can have egos, limited budgets, or a weak community muscle – it’s true! Anyone who has played both CS:GO (by Valve) and Valorant (by Riot) will tell you that a team’s specific approach to tweaking their game matters, and not all are equally skilled at interacting with their player communities. In a competitive game it’s particularly important. It’s the difference between a stale, solved game that only the most dedicated players can enjoy, and an interesting game that continuously appeals to all skill levels with a flourishing grassroots esports scene. (For anyone unfamiliar, Riot is better at this, don’t @ me).\n\n### It’s Not Perfect; It Doesn’t Need to Be Perfect\n\nThe game is in closed beta so yes, there are issues.\n\nIf everything above sounded super nerdy, even for gamers, you might think Dark Forest is more like Eve Online than League of Legends. A cool part of internet gaming subculture? Sure. But not for the masses, just like blockchains.\n\nDuring a previous round the Gnosis Chain was congested and couldn’t handle traffic, so players started [running their own blockchain infrastructure nodes](https://blog.zkga.me/v4-recap)! Would the average Eve player do that? Maybe. The average League player? Eh, they’d sooner be caught running it down mid than running a piece of infra.\n\nBut there are also legitimate problems with the game as-is. The frame rate isn’t great. The community wiki isn’t fully up-to-date. The number of players and invite key list is small so you can’t talk to your friends about it. The new player experience is confusing (I personally re-onboarded 2 other new players at South Park Commons who were discouraged after onboarding friction). Half the plugins I tried didn’t work. Technically the way they store the wallet you use to pay gas fees isn’t super secure (it uses localstorage – if that is gibberish to you just [know it has pitfalls](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220660/local-storage-vs-cookies) but isn’t the end of the world).\n\nBut the kernel of the game and the direction of the team is enough for me to get invested (no no, not with a shitcoin, with my *time*) as a player. I trust the team to carry the game forward and listen to the player community.\n\nMore importantly, they’ve given me renewed optimism on the promise of web3 – that even if it’s not for you today, it will come to you in due time. Not because you can make a quick buck, but because the new experiences created will be worth it! \n  \n And if you want to build the next Dark Forest, hit me up at omar@exaverse.io :)\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nI’d like to thank Cameron Tuckerman-Lee & Stan Kirdey from South Park Commons and @gubsheep & Ivan Chub (@chubivan) from the Dark Forest team for helpful feedback on this post.

Vitalik 等论文摘要\n\n《去中心化社会：找寻 Web3 的灵魂》是 Vitalik 等人联合发表的最新论文，本文讲述了如何通过 “灵魂绑定” Token（本质上来说就是 DID）来建立一个更加多元、丰富的 Desoc（去中心化社会）。论文内容非常长，本文将对这篇论文的重要观点进行转述与总结，这样读者很快就能了解去中心化社会有关知识了。\n\n### 1.1 Web3成立之初的局限性\n\n在不到十年的时间里，Web3 创造了一个庞大的金融帝国，这一成就令世界瞩目，连 facebook 都以 all in 的形式参与到这场金融盛宴之中。加密和经济领域的基础元素，为金融交易带来了一个丰富、开放且多元的生态系统。但是这个过程中出现了一个矛盾，金融交易的经济价值是由人们现实生活中的社会关系等决定的，也就是说它的内部运转逻辑并不完善甚至可以说并不完整。正是由于 Web3 缺乏代表社会身份的基础元素，它从根本上依赖于它所要超越的中心化的 Web2 结构，这具有非常大的局限性。\n\n这种依赖性在具体应用方面也有很明显的体现：\n\n* 虽然 NFT 通过 Opensea 等去中心化平台进行交易，但是许多 NFT 艺术家会通过 Twitter 等中心化平台进行宣传，以向人们证明其真实性并达到推广的目的\n* 各种去中心化项目经常依赖 Web2 基础设施来实施投票\n* 许多 Web3 参与者依赖 Coinbase 或 Binance 等中心化实体管理的托管钱包\n\n此外由于缺乏原生的 Web3 身份，今天的 DeFi 生态系统无法支持实体经济中普遍存在的活动，如等额抵押贷款甚至超低额抵押贷款（目前加密贷款平台一般只支持超额抵押）或者签订公寓租赁等合同。在此我们试图通过“灵魂绑定”的 Token（“soulbound” tokens，SBTs，也就是 DID 去中心化身份）来打破这些局限。除此以外通过 Web3 社会身份，还可以就财富集中和金融攻击的治理脆弱性等更广泛的长期问题上取得巨大进展，同时刺激 web3 的政治、经济和社会应用的大幅发展。我们把这些用例和它们所促成的更丰富的多元生态系统称为“去中心化社会”（DeSoc）。**本文第二部分会就 web2 的社交与 Desoc 进行对比进一步展示出 Desoc 的一些特点与优势。**\n\n### 1.2 Desoc 的要素与畅想\n\n首先我们应先了解一下 DeSoc 的基本元素，它（“灵魂绑定” Token, SBTs） 围绕着人们持有的不可转让的账户（或钱包），代表着承诺、证书和关系，这种 Token 就像一份扩展的简历。可以简单地把这种东西理解为我们的身份证，有了身份证我们就可以缴纳社保、绑定银行卡等。没有身份证或者说法律认可的身份这些都很难实现，而目前的 web3 就处在这种没有身份证明的困局当中。在这里把起身份证明的东西被称为“灵魂”， 将账户持有的 Token 称为“灵魂 Token”（SBTs）。\n\n想象一下这样一个世界，大多数参与者都有“灵魂 Token”，它对应一系列的关系、会员资格和证书。因此人们不用公开自己的真实身份，就可以让他人看到自己的教育证书，就业历史，或自己的著作或艺术作品的一串哈希值，这种 Token 对相关信息的公开类似于人们在简历中分享关于自己的信息。更重要的是，通过这种身份人们可以互相识别，甚至可以实现目前无法达到的等额抵押、合同签订等。人们甚至可以无纸化，因为数据可以记录一切，并且因为它不可篡改的特点，又让一切变得更加可信。在这些技术的支持下 web3 一定会越来越丰富且美好。\n\n### 1.3 相关实例\n\n**艺术与“灵魂”**\n\n艺术家可以通过“灵魂”将作品与自己连接。当发行可交易的 NFT 时，艺术家可以从他们的“灵魂”中发行 NFT。艺术家的“灵魂”携带的 SBTs 越多，买家就越容易识别出“灵魂”是属于该艺术家的，从而也就能确定 NFT 的真实性。艺术家可以更进一步，在他们的“灵魂”中发布一个链接的 SBTs，证明某个 NFT 是该“系列藏品”的成员。因此，“灵魂”将创造一种可靠的、链上的交易和识别方式。 很明显，它的现实应用还有很多，NFT 艺术家的例子只是其中最具有代表性的。实际上，除了 web3 领域外，它也能有解决一些现实问题，比如知识产权、司法文件真伪判断等。毕竟随着深度造假技术的进步，人类和算法的直接检查将越来越无法检测真实性。虽然区块链的加入使我们能够追踪特定作品的制作时间，但 SBTs 将使我们能够追踪相关内容的社会出处，为我们提供丰富的社会背景，让我们了解发布作品的人的“灵魂”——他们的会员资格、关系、证书的组合。通过这种方式“高仿”可以很容易地被识别出来。\n\n**“灵魂”空投**\n\n在具体说明“灵魂”空投之前我们需要明白空投是什么，以及空投的意义到底是什么？区块链领域的空投是一种将数字货币通过区块链技术大规模分发到一些已有的数字货币钱包上的行为，比如以太币、比特币、EOS.IO 钱包。简单来说就是向广大网友“发钱”的过程。\n\n当面对空投人们会有四种行为：（1）上网搜索相关内容（2）和朋友聊相关内容，使朋友知晓有关信息（3）之前或者之后疯狂注册账号，以获得空投（4）直接无视\n\n空投本身是一种非常流行的营销策略，并不是所谓的“慈善”，因此在上述几种情况中，（3）和（4）属于无效空投，并不能带来实际的收益或者说宣传的效果。而其中的第三条属于危害性最大的一条，也就是常说的女巫攻击。为了避免第三条项目方往往设立许多空投限制，但是很明显并不能完全避免。通过 DID 可以有效解决上述问题，因为项目方可以依据 DID 进行空投，可以有效提高投放的精准性和准确性。\n\n论文中的相关例子还有很多这里就不多做列举了，如果感兴趣可以点击[论文原文](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763)进行细致了解。\n\n很显然，上文那两个所谓的相关实例都还是比较理想化的概念。**本文将于第三部分举出一些现有的比较具有代表性的相关去中心化项目，各位读者可以通过这些例子对相关内容予以把握。同时会在第四部分就上文提到的 DID 的使用、价值和发展前景进行详细的说明。**\n\n### 1.4 结论\n\n通过这篇文章大家可以预见到 Desoc 的美好未来，但同时也需要意识到 DID 只是这一远大历程中的一小步。此外，上面描述的场景只是 DeSoc 对现有项目与应用的强化作用，但是并没有涉及对比如物理、政治、社会以及它们与现实世界的复杂关系的描述，而它们实际上占据了我们现实生活的很大比例。所有这些都表明，上面描绘的远大理想，可能只是 DeSoc 最终形态的“雏形”。**论文中就 SBTs 的威胁与挑战也进行了比较细致的描述，在本文的第五部分将结合现实情况进行细致描写这里就不再细说。**\n\n# 2.  新型社交为何悄然而至\n\n### 2.1 Web2.0 传统社交弊病\n\nWeb2.0本质是平台经济，是以一小撮为代表的垄断性寡头构架，互联网在该阶段变成全民级别应用，聚集了社交、搜索、电商等超级生态应用开发，且每个行业领域龙头公司几乎垄断行业资源和发展上限，这使得Web2公司在拥有最终解释权的情况下去剥削和占有用户资源信息时游刃有余，例如微信和QQ在中国产生的影响力和不可置换性，使得用户无法维护本身利益，用户在Web2.0中更像是平台的附庸而不是服务接收者。而Web3.0是属于Token经济的后端程序革命，其本意是在为非平台内部的生态参与者获取更多的话语权和创造权，并拥有产品本身的价值支配权利，以及隐私性和安全性。一定程度的避免了不平衡的垄断机制。\n\n### 2.2 SocialFi 是 Web3.0 的必要组件\n\nSocialFi的出现是对抗传统社交平台弊端的必要产物，Web2.0 时代的社交平台被各大运营巨头控制，从用户数据中获取商业价值，忽略用户的感受。SocialFi基于区块链技术，用户身份信息的匿名性有助于保护隐私和安全，更有利于解决用户数据的确认问题以及权利下放。\n\n相信随着用户对于隐私以及自由的追求，越来越多的人会投身于Web3.0的世界，在用户渴望加密技术带给的数据主权时也渴望获得自己在这个世界独特的身份和地位。在Web2.0-3.0过渡的过程中，互联网用户需要一些中间件来从简单迁移到复杂，从而从原始空间迁移到元空间。元空间的实现需要从现有的互联网世界出发，利用一系列的Web3.0组件，分批分阶段的迎接新的用户。在尝试了Defi的去中心化资产流、NFT的数字工作价值、发现Gamefi的P2E之后，去中心化的意见发布和个人展示已经下一个需要探索和开发的Web3.0组件，在互联网发展历史中可以发现社交化可以说是网民的刚性需求。\n\n### 2.3 线上数据分析\n\n根据[Zippa](https://www.zippia.com/advice/cryptocurrency-statistics/)的统计以及交易平台和钱包的来源，2018-2020 年全球加密货币用户群增加了近 190%，2021 年进一步加速。 数据的增加可能是由于账户数量的增加以及身份识别的改进，以及在 2021 年特斯拉和万事达卡等公司宣布进军加密货世界等从热度上升带来的用户数量造成的。下图展示了Web3.0近几年来的趋势变化：         \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jov7Glf5pfabWlpkN1DD0.png?height=482&width=1141)\n\n根据Google Search数据统计，如今的互联网 2.0 使用用户约在 49.5 亿人左右，对标3亿的加密用户都还只是冰山一角。绝大多数的互联网用户都害困在传统社交网络中，让加密应用的热度扩散才是Web 3.0 走向主流用户的最关键一步。\n\n# 3. 理念的实际运用\n\n### 3.1 ENS\n\nENS”，全称 Ethereum Name Service， 是一个基于以太坊区块链的分布式，开放，可扩展的命名系统。简单来说，通过它可以把原本难以记忆的以太坊地址变成自定义的短地址。通过这种方式，人们可以轻易记下有关内容，既可以减少工作的繁琐程度，也可以减少不必要的风险。同时让用户可以通过以太坊账户和 ENS 配置文件控制自己的数字身份，不再依赖于传统的“中介”。\n\n**技术**\n\n这往往是在注册中心和解析器实现的：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KxP_2muLbCWAntIOITBtl.png?height=458&width=486)\n\nENS注册中心由一个智能合约组成，该合约维护所有域和子域的列表，并存储所有域和子域的三个关键信息：\n\n* 域的所有者\n* 域的解析器\n* 域下所有记录的缓存时间\n\nENS 注册中心作用很简单，只是为了从名称映射到负责它的解析器。解析器负责将名称转换为地址。任何有相关功能的合约都可以作为ENS中的解析器。\n\n在ENS中解析名称有两个步骤：首先，询问注册中心是哪个解析器负责该名称，其次，请该解析器回答查询。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/duhbK48dgxF77doKkPN3t.png?height=254&width=467)\n\n比如，我们试图找到\"foo. eth\"指向的以太坊地址。首先，我们询问注册中心哪个解析器负责“foo. eth”。然后，我们向解析器查询“foo. eth\"的地址。\n\n**数据**（截止至2022-05-23）\n\nDiscord关注：4万+\n\nTwitter关注：18.3万\n\n数据显示，以太坊域名服务商 ENS 在 5 月份以来的收入已经达到了 802 万美元，创下今年以来的新高。今年以来 ENS 已经累计获得了 4864 万美元的收入。\n\n**小结**\n\n通过运作流程可以看出来，整个过程并不会侵害用户的隐私，但是又为加密交易和地址记忆提供了便利条件。V神曾评论说：“ENS是迄今为止最成功的非金融类以太坊应用程序，基本可以类比为一个去中心化的电话册”。很明显它是前文所提到的 Desoc 的一个现实应用和技术支撑，随着行业的发展具有非常巨大的发展潜力。\n\n### 3.2 Bright ID\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wuZhsWQvRKNVOjwoLfTC_.png?height=609&width=1920)\n\nBrightID 是 Web3.0 用户的身份系统，基于以太坊开发，它是完全独立于传统和互联网身份认证的系统。一般用于DAPP用户验证；活动验证；信誉构建等。\n\n具有以下特点：\n\n无门槛：任何人都有权利拥有 Bright ID。\n\n隐私性：Bright ID 不会向用户索取或捕获任何个人隐私信息。\n\n开源：公共产品，完全免费且开源。\n\n**运作和验证方式**\n\nBrightID需要经过人脸和多人认证的方式来通过审核。认证结合链下会议视频等非隐私信息渠道的方式，采用视频会议的形式，由以上六位验证官负责主持验证会议并进行验证工作。验证会议的具体时间日历可在 BrightID 官网查看。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gp05mZ9Gx-tgYSiH2uGga.png?height=354&width=1280)\n\n**相关数据**\n\n融资信息\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BmJ3Z3sIoWc7xg5mA4WAk.png?height=70&width=514)\n\nMetaCartel 是一个由软件工程师、创业者以及以太坊爱好者构建的去中心化社区。他们在全球拥有600多名成员，他们具有丰富的领域经验和专业技能。已经为很多此领域最受欢迎的新兴项目提供了早期资金：Mintbase；Known Origin；Kickback；RocketNFT；Gelato Finance等。\n\n数据分析(截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注：13.2K\n\nAPP 融合：13款\n\nBright ID 用户：57K+\n\n**合作方：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySb7HH2E3tUyY-Zz9BFgX.png?height=471&width=1323)\n\n**小结**\nBrightID 在Web3.0时代扮演着很重要的角色，DAPP&APP、活动组织都采用 BrightID 进行身份验证。但这仅仅是 BrightID 潜力的一小部分，随着 BrightID 产品的迭代，以及其构建的信任网络不断扩大，将成就 BrightID 无限的可能性。\n\n### 3.3 MetaMask\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0n_GpHSQzK8HF-UjI7TT-.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nMetaMask，又或是人们口中常说的“小狐狸”钱包，日益成为加密圈内不可或缺的工具，你的钱包地址在一定程度上，可以代表你个人在链上的身份。\n\nMetaMask是一个通过web2互联网浏览器就能访问，且以低门槛与以太坊网络进行交互的工具钱包。它是Consensys目前面对终端用户的唯一产品，是以太坊最早的钱包之一，也是目前用户量最大的钱包。始于2015年，长期以网页端、免费、“半官方”的形态为大众所熟知，属于非托管型钱包。随着2020年Defi应用热潮与2021年NFT的火爆市场效应，MetaMask的用户量极速增长。2020年新增手机客户端和交易功能（名为Swap）。2021年5月推出MetaMask机构版，让机构用户能将MetaMask与机构级托管结合、方便工作流管理、易于汇报等。\n\n但起初，MetaMask其实并不是作为钱包插件之类的消费者项目，而是希望成为一种开发工具。Metamask母公司，是以太坊联合创始人Joseph Lubin所创办的区块链巨头公司之一的ConsenSys。ConsenSys 是以太坊重点项目的企业孵化器，旗下的MetaMask是ConsenSys布局的六大业务板块基础设施板块的重点项目。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YnjEZyE-akF8hkOslm1UO.png?height=188&width=839)\n\n**技术**\n\n现MetaMask已兼容绝大部分的区块链网络Dapp（包括Ethereum、Binance、Polygon），可集成托管解决方案来管理秘钥存储和多重签名批准。团队也在逐步优化产品本身，简化交易流程、减少交易费用、签字程序等。并逐步提升其合规能力，让钱包内可以进行高风险评估，安全进行去中心化和匿名交易等。\n对于大量的用户选择MetaMask作为迈入Web3的第一步，团队除了打磨好产品，提升钱包本身的安全性能，用户友好度之外。面对发展迅猛的加密货币行业，使用需求量的暴增与跨网络的需求都是不可忽视的问题。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pzMu5CxfcUo_ekJI1Ma9l.png?height=419&width=1445)\n\n**相关数据（截止到2022-05-23）**\n\n**Twitter关注**：75.4 K\n\n**融资情况**：2022-03-16，ConsenSys 完成4.5亿美元D轮融资，完成最新一轮融资后，ConsenSys的估值超过70亿美元，比2021年11月完成2亿美元C 轮融资时的估值增加一倍以上。ConsenSys首席执行官Joe Lubin在接受Decrypt采访时表示，MetaMask很快将推出DAO并发行代币。新的DAO并不会参与管理MetaMask，但将为MetaMask的更新提供资金。可见，MetaMask的资金储备是比较充足的。\n\n**其他数据**：\n\n根据公开数据，截止目前，MetaMask的月活跃用户已达到3000万。而巅峰时期的以太坊全网活跃地址也才只有 800 万左右。不难看出，Meta钱包的月活跃数量远超于此，也印证了MetaMask钱包现在已经成为了大量加密的首选。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZijDJTKGeNWtZC7Higmnt.png?height=804&width=1526)\n\n截止到2022年3月份，MetaMask插件的下载了超过1,000,000，目前日活跃用户大概在6k-8k左右，每日新用户超过2K+。目前加密货币钱包类用户早已超过8000万，对于一些出现的维护问题，团队已出现了棘手的情况。\n\n相较于互联网46亿的活跃用户来说，加密货币未来的将拥有更广阔的市场。目前MetaMask主要支持以太坊和各种EVM链，未来若想跨接到Solana等多生态，团队将如何开拓和维系其服务，值得期待。\n\n**小结**\n\n如今，MetaMask的使用已相当普及，这似乎已成为了进入Web3的第一步——生成你的去中心化钱包地址。而钱包也逐渐成为区块链世界中的一种身份象征，作为用户使用频率最高的小狐狸钱包，swap与NFT购买，是其最常用的两个功能。也因为以太坊生态中任何一个应用，都会支持MetaMask，两者的发展相辅相成，逐渐将钱包地址与Web3世界里去中心化个人身份的划上等号。\n未来，伴随着多链时代的到来，通用钱包的概念或将被逐渐被弱化，取而代之的可能是针对性更强的点对点产品服务，如专门的NFT钱包，打金钱包等。随着时间的推移，MetaMask自身以及新生代的钱包的发展都同样值得期待\n\n### 3.4 CyberConnect \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eXmS6-XLpYtKe3eZn9mQm.png?height=77&width=346)\n\nCyberconnect旨在解决社交图表（Social Graph）再分配问题，这个问题其实很好去解释，就是说Web2.0中各种平台的信息无法互通，造成重复资源浪费且难以找到各种志同道合的用户，社交图谱相对单一。\n\n而Cyberconnect所表明的内涵或者本质也很简单（用户之间的关系不仅仅是双向或者三向的，更是各种交叉和重叠的混合网络关系）例如A本身，与A关注的用户，和关注A的用户进行不同连线组合，形成一张独特的“图谱”，证明该用户的社交关系网，而从这些与用户A有联系的人又重新编织，又将形成新的图谱。这样网络世界中拥有相同的兴趣爱好的用户，同游戏玩家，商品贸易中的的买家卖家等通过社交图谱逐渐变得清晰。**如此一来，CyberConnect 便打破了不同平台之间的壁垒。**\n\n**技术**\n\n关于数据和存储：CyberConnect社交图数据存储时使用的IPFS和无许可协议Ceramic构建，联通Ceramic区块链锚定和自定义数据固定服务，可以保证CyberConnect链上数据长期存储。（使用Ceramic DID方法）关于用户数据在不同的平台如何集成，则需要采用Ceramic身份协议IDX，它为开发人员提供一个统一的界面，在CyberConnect内部查询这些数据分析，反过来CyberConnect也会给与DID链上系统提供更多的身份数据。\n\n与其它项目集成：同时CyberConnect还会与其它Web3项目集成获取信息，例如NFT平台Foundation与Rarible等，其实最重要的一点是让玩家通过一个统一的身份来参与不同种类的生态应用，同时也能与Web2链接使链上和链下数据结合起来成为更强大的去中心化数据提供商。\n\n**相关数据：**(数据截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注数：57,7k+\n\n生态项目数：30+\n\n入驻用户：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a7o2JaOaNfPgndwT2sSm3.png?height=108&width=679)\n\n融资消息：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MKRShXhLUbStaV7wGpQdV.png?height=127&width=685)\n\n其中的Multicoin曾投资过Near Protocol、Solana、Helium、Duna Analytics、Audius等潜力新兴区块链或者具有足够实际应用的优质Web3.0应用，此次Cyberconnect也正是该机构看好未来web3社交领域的潜力而开展的首次社交应用投资，证明该赛道的早期成长属性和该项目未来价值发掘。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgkZfhUF3wFkZo_i2RlCP.png?height=542&width=1145)\n\n**小结**\n\n社交化图标也是DID最核心应用场景之一。毕竟身份的重要程度随着社交功能完善等比例增长。虽然目前Cyberconnect已经接入Solana、Ethereum、Binance网络链，在用户体验感上来说，以太坊网络链是功能较完善且操作流畅，但部分操作功能在Solana上还处于开发阶段，不仅容易在网络上造成拥堵而且需要使用不同的钱包插件，使得用户体验感下降。\n\n作为一个去中心化的社交图谱协议，为Web3.0社会网络和元宇宙服务，CyberConnect还需要在前进的道路上完成更多的目标。\n\n### 3.5 Mirror\n\n提到去中心化的写作平台，大部分区块链用户都会脱口而出“Mirror”，其平台在成立不到一年就被联合广场风险投资公司估值1亿美元，获1千万美元投资。作为去中心化的写作平台赛道代表——Mirror 是依靠哪些去中心化特性和功能”荣登“宝座呢？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jylJj2d9u5m_YMYfOnvQA.png?height=601&width=865)\n\n**功能简介**\n\nMirror 跟中心化的写作平台最大的不同是，他具备加密区块链产品的特性和功能。参与用户无需通过邮箱账号，手机号码，社交帐户等中心化的身份验证手段来注册账号，只需要绑定自己的0x开头的钱包地址即可生成独一无二的“作者专栏”，类似于上文所提及的ENS（以太坊域名）。对于部分创作者来说，跟外界的接触仅仅由一串小小的字符连接，完美的融合了去中心化身份的理念。\n\n除此之外，创作者可以在Mirror平台上发布文章/创作图片等作品，每一件公开发布的作品不是保存在中心化服务器上，而是透过区块链存储专案Arweave进行链上的数据保存，经用户进行加密签名后生成一段哈希值记录，将作品永久的保存在区块链上。Mirror上更是支持创作者将自己的作品铸造成NFT，让原先没有边际成本、可被无限复制的内容作品具有稀缺性，从而被赋予价值。不仅无法被他人复制或修改，而且可以在各大NFT市场上进行售卖。\n\n其次，Mirror 也提供读者募资功能，读者喜欢的文章可以直接使用加密货币”打赏“创作者；共同的创作者可以按照设定好的盈利比例来获取各自部分的收益；以及其平台上的作品拍卖功能等等。\n\n**技术**\n\nMirror 在保存用户文章时使用的两类 Web3 组件，一个是用于对文章进行永久存储的 Arweave，另一个是用于对文章进行确权与交易的 NFT 铸造平台以太坊主网。\n\n1. Mirror 的存储组件-Arweave，是一条针对存储进行了底层性能优化的公链，因此用户在 Arweave 链上存储数据的成本相较其他智能合约公链平台有极大的降低。同时，链上存储的特征保证了在 Arweave 之上存储数据的永久性，因此，基于 Arweave 的存储模式也常被归类为永久存储。创作者在保存文章修改的时候，Mirror 会在后台自动对新的文章进行二次上链存储。\n2. Mirror 的确权组件，在存储的同时，通常会需要另一组 Web3 组件，以便对存储的内容进行确权，也就是将内容铸造为 NFT 格式的资产。但此步骤是在以太坊网络上以 NFT 的形式进行确权，成本由创作者自行承担支付。\n\n**相关数据（截至2022-05-23）**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sjq8tIDcdQka6SZ6w-cY3.png?height=71&width=699)\n\n**小结**\n\n去中心化创作平台-Mirror 的核心创新点很多，打破了传统创作平台的束缚，将NFT，社区DAO，Write-Fi相结合的经济模型，解决了部分去中心化平台所追求的“通过创作内容实现价值变现”的难题，相信 Mirror 这样肩负着去中心化任务的创作平台也会在迈向 WEB3.0 的道路上越走越远。\n\n### 3.6 Project Galaxy\n\nProject Galaxy 的愿景是想要打造一个最大的 Web3 数据凭证（credential data）网络，建造一个开放协作数据聚合基础设施，助力开发者和项目方建造更好的产品和社区。项目方在 Project Galaxy 平台上面为用户创建并奖励 NFT，用户完成项目方的任务，比如在链上进行特定的交互、参加会议、关注推特、加入 Discord 社区、提交问卷、参与测试等方式获得NFT。\n\n**技术：**\n\nProject Galaxy 目前支持两种方式来提供数据凭证 GraphQL 和 REST API。Galaxy上有两个角色，分别是数据贡献者和使用者。数据贡献者可以用子图查询或静态快照（subgraph queries or static snapshots）的方式贡献链上数据，同时在链下，Galaxy 也集成了信息来源，比如推特和 GitHub。\n\n数据使用者使用 Application module, Credential Oracle Engine, and Credential API 三种方式使用数据。并使用 Galaxy 的代币 $GAL 支付，因此数据贡献者可以获得激励。\n\n**相关数据**：\n\n已入驻项目方：400+\n\nGalaxy ID 用户：170 万+\n\nTwitter关注：30 万+\n\n融资情况：2021 年 5 月种子轮融资，2022年1月由 Multicoin Capital 和 Dragonfly Capital 领投、多个机构参投的 1000 万美元融资。随后 2 月在 CoinList 平台公募获得 1500 万美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gZN7tj9iV2lHWkssLK7Z3.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nProject Galaxy上线时间为2021年5月，运行不到一年，活跃用户量远大于同类型的项目 POAP 和 Rabbithole 。2021 年底银河女孩系列 NFT 活动让 Project Galaxy 一举成名，银河女孩 NFT 持有者更是获得了该项目原生代币 $GAL 在 CoinList 平台上公募的优先队列名额。后续 Meta Cowboy，Dr.SOL 等系列 NFT 持有者也获得了 $GAL 空投。\n\n**小结**\n\nProject Galaxy 无疑是一个非常成功的项目。链上身份凭证和数字身份一直都有市场需求，Project Galaxy 作为多链项目满足了市场在这方面的需求，为整个加密生态系统提供服务。在经历 Defi Summer 和 NFT Summer 之后 ，它抓住了 Crypto 项目方频繁使用 NFT 作为用户激励工具的需求。它给项目方提供了发放 NFT 奖励活动的工具和用户流量资源，初步形成了项目方和项目方之间，项目方和用户之间，用户和用户之间的多重网络效应。\n\n# 4. 新型社交的展望\n\n### 最初的载体与未来场景？\n\n绝大部分用户最熟悉DID理念实际运用应该是区块链钱包，例如Metamask是作为用户接入整个区块链的入口端，具有隐私性、安全性、不可追踪性。这是DID赛道最初应用成果，但是其缺点也很明确。钱包地址的注册缺少独特性，一个人可以注册大量毫无价值的钱包。其次大钱包只能显示代币难以展示NFT和参与证明等未来势必流行的资产，更不用说SBT所畅享的“无纸化”证明，这是钱包的局限性。第三钱包无法配置资产可编程属性，无法限制其他人查看钱包资产，从而导致黑客攻击情况发生。不过理念的实践是处于不断完善的过程。现在已经出现了可以展示NFT和参与证明（POA）的去中心化身份应用，还有隐私赛道对于钱包和其它DID应用进行代币隐私化、资产可视化等功能赋能等，预计不短时间内所有区块链赛道应用可以进行用户DID绑定，可记录用户等额抵押、合同签订、参与证明和哈希参数等不可篡改的数据，潜在提升单一用户DID价值\n\n从结构和理论上来阐述，有社交的地方更加注重身份特征，所以从根本属性上来说SocialFi就是实现该理念的最初赛道，只有用户们尝试并参与进来，才能够从本质上理解DID在区块链各赛道中重要程度，在未来去中心化社交领域当中，寻找相同理念思想的用户从而构建和谐关系，通过新兴匹配技术进行身份特征快速转移和整合，快速的梳理出用户兴趣爱好与社交圈，可以大程度的减少网络中诈骗行为，提高社交沟通交流效率。\n\n### 如何评估用户DID价值赋能？\n\n未来DID账号的价值根据其内部的资产总数和分配比例，如加密货币、NFT、参与证明等进行价值评估，以及个人身份信息验证，与其他用户之间互动，评论留言等进行附加属性评估。最后就是项目之间的筛选机制和会员资格评判，如拥有某些NFT或者证明的用户获得相应空投奖励、参与测试的资格等，这些都进一步的丰富了DID整体价值属性。\n\n对于目前市场来说，DID基础设施赛道仍未出现热点项目能引领该赛道的热潮，例如DeFi的火热是Uniswap带领的，GameFi的出圈前者与Axie有关，后者StepN再次引领，所以扩大潜在用户群体还需要落实到实际具体项目当中，单一可行的理念是无法吸引到足够的投资者的。\n\nDID赛道本身是没有主动生产价值的能力，创建了钱包地址不代表钱包有钱，但是从另一角度来说DID也是最能兼容区块链中所有领域的基础设施，其价值决定极大程度上基于与其它项目应用的兼容，毕竟DID属于后端程序，与个性化应用并不冲突。\n\n### 趋势预测\n\n在如今整体环境影响下，以NFT和GameFi赛道为首的炒作属性偏高的赛道整体估值下降较多，新用户和资金参与量明显下跌，而以Web 3.0等基础设施属性较强的底层架构融资情况增长。可以明确的是DID与SocialFi等赛道会长时间处于发展道路中，寻找相关实际应用和价值层次赋能，且随着未来涌入区块链赛道的用户会越来越多，下一个牛市用户数量可能会达到三到五倍的增幅，用户之间的社交属性和凭证需求会随着用户数等比例增长，所以目前早期部署该赛道，其未来潜力也是无法估量的。\n\n# 5. DID 与 SocialFi 发展过程中可能的挑战\n\nDID 赛道 和 SocialFi 目前处于早期探索阶段，有着巨大的发展前景，隐藏着许多仍未被发掘的机会，但同时也有着不少问题等待 Web3 建设者们去挑战：\n\n* 不可转让这一概念本身就存在着技术上的挑战，在限制或防止转移的需求和区块链生态系统之间有着难以跨越的障碍，因为目前来说，几乎所有的项目标准都是围绕着最大可转移性来设计的。\n* 隐私是此类生态系统良好运作的一个重要前提。许多情况下，用户并不希望透露他们所有的身份信息。去中心化的身份信息如何做到仅在必要的时候披露给必要的对象，也是在技术上所面临的一大挑战。\n\n一个只规范资本而不规范人类个人行为的制度可能只会无情地服务于金钱而非人类本身。我们作为 Web3 的参与者和建设者，需要更多的思考和更多的努力来解决这些挑战。而如果我们能够成功解决，则为区块链那些并非只关注金钱的生态系统，打开了一扇通往更为广阔天地的大门。\n\n## 参考资料\n\n1.

Initial coin offerings (ICOs) have developed as a new method for entrepreneurial finance, with parallels to initial public offerings, venture capital, and presale crowdfunding (Howell, Niessner & Yermack, 2020). Today, cryptocurrencies market capitalization hovers around 1.6 trillion dollars, and there are four main types of tokens: payment, utility, security, and non-fungible. Utility tokens are the most popular form today and serve as the media of exchange on the associated blockchain platform. At this point, cryptocurrencies would not need any further introduction. However, there is still widespread scepticism and a lack of comprehension of the fundamentals that underpin the value of tokens, especially utility tokens. This is largely because traditional security valuation techniques do not easily apply to their complex nature, and the overall crypto market has become notorious for its large price volatility, scams, jokes, and frauds.\n\nOver the last two years, Covid-19 triggered an enormous wave of retail investors with little to no expertise pursuing the opportunities of a bull cycle on stocks, as well as the crypto market. This social media-investing revolution has generated a lot of self-proclaimed investing and crypto gurus, which have made it easier for people to follow blindly and gamble money into the crypto market without prior due diligence. I do believe theirs some content creators out there who bring excellent “not financial advise” to the crypto-space and provide a thorough analysis to their viewers. But, this buzz has fueled a wave of getting-rich quick novice speculators rather than investors, and most cannot even explain what their crypto holdings even do.\n\nWhile speculation is not necessarily a vice, it is a short term game, and it can be very profitable during bull markets. However, it is unlikely to provide a lifetime of sustainable income or returns. Investors deciding on factual data plays a central role for healthy functioning markets, and better and widely adopted valuation methods will help the crypto-space to mature into one.\n\nRecently the market has stumbled, with Bitcoin around the $29,000 mark and many altcoins have double-digit drops. Phases of contraction and expansion of an emerging asset class are natural regardless of which page we turn in the calendar. I believe this is a great ‘cooldown’ period where projects are able to consolidate, and newcomers and speculators who got ‘reckt’ by trying to time the market to learn and reassess their strategies. For this reason, I thought it was a great time to start writing a three-part series to share a simple, not simpler due-diligence framework for valuing cryptos combining outstanding research papers on the field that I’ve scrutinised during my economics studies at the University of Queensland and my own takes on the subject.", "timestamp": 1653379606, "digest": "COtrR9MOhdz1JAWztYdcnlqUl4V6XGbF8wE2tRshYYE", "contributor": "0x56c79c0eaB20BAFa2A643509A07B1Ee09941e597"}

The month ended with 9.22 million active users and $34.37 million in transactions. However, compared to March, active users and transaction volume declined by 24.9 percent and 73.4 percent, respectively.\n\nDespite the decline in users and volume, some GameFi projects continued to perform well. For example, STEPN was the hottest DApp on the crypto market that month, Splinterlands ranked #1 in daily active users with a daily average of over 350,000, and DeFi Kingdoms surpassed Axie Infinity as the most traded GameFi project.\n\n## GameFi Market Overview\n\n### GameFi project count 5.2% YoY, growth concentrated in BSC and Polygon\n\nAccording to Footprint Analytics, as of April 30, 38 public chains have participated in the GameFi space, with 1,479 game projects, a 5.2% increase from the previous year.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Number of GameFi Protocols by Chains](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A1x2ratuDjawXPEYZXFy4.png?height=856&width=1640)\n\nEthereum's project count in the GameFi ecosystem is not growing as fast as on the BSC and Polygon chains. The projects on BSC and Polygon have become some of the more popular games in the crypto market today. They include Bomb Crypto and Mobox on BSC; Crazy Defense Heroes and Pegaxy on Polygon.\n\nDevelopers prefer BSC and Polygon games because of their low gas fees, high throughput, and high security on par with Ethereum. The number of projects on Ethereum is gradually divided by public chains such as BSC, Polygon and WAX, attracting a large number of game users and projects.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Monthly Number of Games by Chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oEi-Orz67J3BptHGJt9Go.png?height=471&width=922)\n\n### Active users down 24.9% YoY, GameFi's transaction volume down\n\nAs of April 30, the total number of active users was 9.22 million, of which 780,000 were new users. Compared to March, the number of active users decreased by 24.9%.\n\nSince October, the number of new and active users has declined, despite the increase in the number of games.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Monthly Gamers Trend](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vbx-bzf899hP_M-nis_Ca.png?height=755&width=1443)\n\nBut not all public chain games are unpopular; for example, the Polygon game ecosystem saw a 25% increase in new users, led by Crazy Defense Heroes and Pegaxy.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - GameFi New Users by Chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/W3OVWXC7UrTmBBcfyHu7M.png?height=572&width=1772)\n\nAccording to Footprint Analytics, trading volumes spiked from October to November, even exceeding $510 million in daily trading volume. However, since January, GameFi trading volume has been in a slump due to the macroeconomic impact. Per capita trading volume has gradually dropped from $105 to $20.\n\nIn addition, the Axie Infinity hack in mid-February significantly impacted active users and trading volume, which resulted in the loss of over $615 million in ETH and USDC to users.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - GameFi of Volume Trend](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S0-N2B2CU_lcYOnjPoZyt.png?height=717&width=1536)\n\n![Footprint Analytics - GameFi Volume and Transactions per User](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JnvWRkhU3NsqkXxKTY6y7.png?height=709&width=1541)\n\n### Nearly $2.4 billion raised in GameFi, up 381% YoY\n\nThe data shows that the overall blockchain space saw the largest amount of funding in April, with investments totaling $6.62 billion. the GameFi space accounted for 36.3% of the total investments, with $2.4 billion invested. Compared to March, GameFi grew by 381%.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Funding-Monthly Investment Trend](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NCyCo0RB8V7eU0CAHY0x2.png?height=768&width=1550)\n\nWeb3 has seen the largest investment in the investment space, with STEPN, a Web3 project that combines elements of GameFi and SocialFi, being the most notable project.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Gaming Financing Distribution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_OlOh_KTfT9RQkB9PAsr3.png?height=769&width=1511)\n\n### April GameFi data underperformed, but still had great projects\n\nWhile the macro trend was negative, several projects performed well in April. Splinterlands continued to rank #1 in daily active users for over three months, averaging over 350,000 daily. deFi Kingdoms surpassed Axie Infinity as the most traded GameFi project. And STEPN became the hottest DApp on the crypto market with Move to Earn.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Top 10 Games Ranking by Users (April 30)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zmYW8n4J9nJCfB48CMTbg.png?height=743&width=1743)\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Top 10 Games Ranking by Volume](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cna3aKb71yKzV3Ki3MxBN.png?height=759&width=1747)\n\n### Splinterlands holds the number one spot with 350,000 daily users\n\nSplinterlands, an NFT card game, has become the most popular program in the GameFi space. According to Footprint Analytics, the number of users and transactions is gradually increasing and stabilizing.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Splinterlands Users & Transactions](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JcKwTaUX_QdAA4tnvb4om.png?height=737&width=1761)\n\nSplinterlands has proven to be popular for its simple gameplay and low barrier to entry. And like Axie Infinity and other games, it uses a dual-currency model to stabilize the liquidity of in-game funds and minimize the impact of token price fluctuations in the secondary market on the game.\n\n### DeFi Kingdoms surpasses Axie Infinity as the most traded project\n\nAs of March 29, DFK has overtaken Axie Infinity as the most traded program. News of the attack on Axie Infinity, which was considered safe, shook users' confidence and trading volumes fell off. As a result, April will be a tough month for Axie Infinity, which will hopefully be able to restore user confidence in the game by recovering $5.8 million in funding and launching Axie Infinity Origin's new arena game mode on April 7.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Comparison of Users Axie Infinity and DeFi Kingdoms](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BSbV3grt0pTrZeb8zm0RE.png?height=744&width=1653)\n\n![Footprint Analytics - DeFi Kingdoms Monthly Retention Analysis](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/byeld7lza8BcQ324fgHuf.png?height=666&width=1911)\n\nAlthough DeFi Kingdoms has no VC funding, they maintain a monthly user retention rate and a solid daily user base through their own Tokenomics and the team's planning and advancement of the program.\n\n### STEPN becomes the most popular DApp\n\nSTEPN is the first successful Move-to-Earn game and has the real potential to become the long-awaited game that will bring GameFi into the mainstream.\n\nPlayers buy NFT sneakers and earn through in-game tokens. It further gamifies sports by creating a system of sneaker upgrades, such as walking, jogging or running.\n\nSTEPN has been online for less than 6 months and as of April 30, its market cap has surpassed $2 billion. Now that Axie Infinity has fallen short of new users, STEPN may even surpass Axie Infinity's $2.2 billion market cap.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Market Cap of STEPN and Axie Infinity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KiCtDgpopZ5dMBXXJZknC.png?height=763&width=1776)\n\nFootprint Analytics data shows that the price of token GMT rose from $0.16 to $3.52, an increase of 2100% in a short period of time.\n\n![Footprint Analytics - Trading Volume vs Price of STEPN](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dGe5f6pw6Tey4v0ACM36r.png?height=751&width=1770)\n\nThere is no doubt that STEPN is currently one of the hot trends in the market.\n\n## Summary\n\nWhile GameFi was closely tied to macro trends, with overall transaction and user numbers declining overall, there was no stopping individual game projects from making a splash in April. STEPN grew rapidly, with DFK overtaking Axie Infinity as the most traded project and Splinterlands stabilizing its daily active user base.\n\nWelcome to join #NowhereDAO, a free information and token information sharing platform:  \n\n[https://discord.gg/JHXpb8KDzk](https://discord.gg/JHXpb8KDzk)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653379761, "digest": "OrPucadiHsJBZm-iGGrKTXI49gBhu6Cl6JunjCYBX3E", "contributor": "0xC16bf23A6E1282298467ED76AF912b9E9108431A"}

{"id": "3eclgVkvvNbpYaTtxszaRRuFVawrogwlUOTVRXrcgEc", "title": "Energy($NRG) - Under-collateralized Stablecoin", "body": "## Overview\n\nEnergy($NRG) is an under-collateralized algorithmic stablecoin of EntropyDAO. In order to ensure the circulation supply of $NRG can be steadily increased under-collateralized, and most of the $NRG holders can redeem their $NRG back into $USDC at 99% of the time, a series of mechanisms are mentioned below to realize this seemingly impossible target:\n\n* Mint & Redeem\n* BOND\n\nMint & Redeem provides a long-term stable primary market 1:1 exchange scenario. When the secondary market price is higher or lower than 1 USDC, arbitrageurs can always use the mechanism to equalize the exchange rate between the primary and secondary markets which keeps the $NRG price stable at 1 USDC for a long time. But where does the liquidity of the $NRG primary and secondary markets come from? To this end, EntropyDAO introduces the innovative $NRG BOND mechanism.\n\nInvestors who pursue low-risk and stable returns can buy $NRG Bond NFT in $USDC. EntropyDAO promises to return the principal (paid with $NRG) and certain interest (50%$NRG+50%$ENT) when Bond NFT reaches Maturity Dates. EntropyDAO uses 100% of the $USDC funds to add liquidity to the $NRG primary and secondary markets . At the same time, 50% of the promised interest ($NRG) is used to buy $ENT immediately from the secondary market and reserve it as the $ENT part of Bond interest which will be paid in the future.\n\nIn this way, EntropyDAO solve the following three problems through the Bond mechanism: Who is $NRG assigned to during expansion?\n\n* Low-risk appetite investors who are willing to buy long-term bonds to obtain stable returns. How to support the $NRG redemption problem in an under-collateralized situation?\n* Investors who purchase long-term bonds will pay cash to the protocol to supplement the existing liquidity and obtain the rights and benefits of earning new stablecoins in the future. How will the added interest (currency) be paid in the long run?\n* By buying $ENT from the secondary market, the protocol continuously adds 50% of the freshly minted stablecoin($NRG) into the $ENT secondary market, attracting more high-risk appetite investors to invest and stake $ENT through the price mechanism. More investors choose to hold and stake $NRG, ensuring that the $NRG circulating in the market can still have enough collateral for short-term redemption, forming a positive cycle.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HE-l7vECKYRJg_CkNJZVX.png?height=624&width=1218)\n\n## Mint & Redeem\n\n$USDC (and some ETH as the gas fee) is the only thing needed to mint a $NRG. There is no tax fee for mint action so $NRG could be minted by $USDC 1:1 without any limit. After that, all the $USDC will be stored in “Energy Reserve”  for redemption.\n\n**Why hold $NRG and what can it do?** $NRG will host the stability and payment functions of the EntropyDAO protocol. Governance token Entropy($ENT) will be priced by $NRG and LP BOND of $ENT will only be purchased by $NRG too. Besides, more infrastructure for $NRG will be introduced into EntropyDAO in 2022 Q3 and Q4. For example, the Marketplace of $NRG BOND will launch for swapping $NRG BOND NFT and use $NRG as the payment medium.\n\n**There is also no limit to redeem the $NRG.** $NRG can always be exchanged for $USDC on Uniswap v2, or at a 1:1 ratio through redemption to $USDC.\n\nPS: For the initial launch of EntropyDAO, only $USDC will be the collateral token.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fzsG9ldsT4PJ_6y_gb1ql.png?height=672&width=1088)\n\n## Bond\n\nThe Bond mechanism of OlympusDAO is definitely one of the most impressive designs in 2021. It not only solves the problem of who(users) and why(bond discounts) provide the liquidity, but also the concept of protocol owned liquidity (POL) was introduced to solve the death spiral problem of the previous LP farm module when the token price fell. However, it doesn't mean their designs are 100% perfect. Users still have to add the LP by themselves through a series of complicated processes which makes it not user-friendly enough. Also, the formula of Bond discount is hard for the public to understand.\n\nBased on OHM’s excellent LP bond design, some adjustments will be added to EntropyDAO：\n\n1. **Pay only with $USDC**: Investors only need $USDC instead of creating LP tokens to buy the $NRG bond NFT\n2. **BOND NFT**: Investors will receive a Bond NFT after payment, it will record bond terms like when and how much they buy. All of the principles and 50% of the interest, which is called the $NRG Face value in total, will be paid by $NRG. And the remaining 50% of the interest will be swapped into $ENT from $NRG immediately based on the market price and stored on contracts until the bond NFT matures.The $ENT amount that the user will get is the $ENT Face value.\n3. **Maturity Date:** After the bond reaches its maturity date, investors can use Bond NFT to claim the principal and interest back.\n4. **Protocol Owned Liquidity(POL):** Half of the $USDC investors provide will be used to mint $NRG automatically, and then all these $NRG will be added into the liquidity of $NRG-$USDC with the remaining half of $USDC by contracts.\n5. **Long-term & Low-risk:** As half interest will be paid directly by $NRG, it will give the Bond NFT a long-term stable value and reduce the risk for users to hold it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/R7RFEz_J0xPXH91TaX0NF.png?height=648&width=1500)\n\n## Expansion and Contraction\n\nBased on the Overview part, the freshly issued $NRG is distributed to $NRG Bond NFT holders. Some key indicators need to be introduced here to measure the expansion condition and quota. Besides that, contraction of $NRG based on certain conditions is also considered in EntropyDAO.\n\n### Short-term Supply (S0)\n\nShort-term Supply is an indicator to measure the $NRG supply which will be circulated on the market in the short-term (less than 7 days). 100% of the supply provided as liquidity of NRG-USDC LP ( SN ) and 70%(TBD) of the supply provided as liquidity of ENT-NRG LP ( SE) are regarded as stable enough and will not be redeemed in the short term. Also, for different vesting term of $NRG bond, (Ti-7) / Ti of the bond debts are regarded to be paid in a short time. Thus, the Short-term Supply (S0) of $NRG is calculated as below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/h04l1vDtEHhmHY0dAofC4.png?height=75&width=495)\n\n* **S0** is the Short-term Supply of $NRG\n* ***St*** is the total supply of $NRG\n* ***Sn*** is the supply of $NRG provided as liquidity to NRG-USDC LP on a DEX (Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc.)\n* ***Se*** is the supply of $NRG provided as liquidity to ENT-NRG LP on a DEX (Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc.)\n* ***Bi*** is the total bond debts based on the different vesting term i\n* **Ti** is the vesting term (days) of different bonds.\n\n### Current Ratio\n\nThe current ratio is a general indicator of the business's ability to meet its short-term financial commitments. For EntropyDAO, the current ratio is defined as the indicator of the protocol’s ability to meet its short-term supply.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zLnXYyMg2NkuqA7z11_oO.png?height=77&width=581)\n\n* ***Ct*** is the total collateral stored by EntropyDAO, including the $USDC stored on $NRG Reserve and provided as liquidity on NRG-USDC LP\n* ***S0*** is the Short-term Supply of $NRG\n\n### Expansion\n\nEvery 8 hours, EntropyDAO checks the levels of the Current Ratio and decides whether to expand the supplies of $NRG. The freshly issued $NRG will not be distributed directly to any address but allocated to different vesting term bonds in the form of new quotas of $NRG BOND. Besides, only if the remaining quota of each bond is lower than 10%, the expansion of the $NRG bond quota will succeed.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J2Xs-qxjvMTWZSw2Fx7xI.png?height=204&width=612)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ys5F0b_VZp98lBgu1Rlt4.png?height=157&width=628)\n\n### Contraction\n\nUnlike expansion, EntropyDAO doesn't directly contract the supply of $NRG, but increases the market demand for $NRG by burning the reserve of $ENT. Every 8 hours, EntropyDAO will check the current ratio level, and use the $NRG accumulated by $ENT BOND to complete the contraction mechanism through buying $ENT by $NRG and burning $ENT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vhiH9WZPuQF4rBCK5Vd3A.png?height=199&width=609)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DFt683_bwbMwbc34vKn5E.png?height=273&width=705)\n\n### Updated in Future\n\nIn the EntropyDAO roadmap, the Bond expansion smart contracts will totally be held and managed by the DAO which is not only for a few managers but for all gENT holders. Actually, the indicators and formulas presented above still have the space to be better. Thus, EntropyDAO decides to list all the key parameters of Bond expansion indicators for $gENT holders to vote for adjustment. There is no doubt that the more people truly understand and participate in the EntropyDAO, the more possibility that it can be an actual evolving protocol.", "timestamp": 1653381515, "digest": "-LXKaV_rmqTLEcOyDyvV7dY7WE0HHGhsidENRqe71CE", "contributor": "0xD19C8FF9aFba9cC3c69E1251240dA1805123E44b"}

{"id": "GanUmQ9fdcAPhvPx7IUEnTqgOFulBAEhf52oYL4RBUs", "title": "Create a new chain for Web3 Application?", "body": "**Web3 Meetup**\n\nI remember at the end of 2018, my companions and I organized blockchain technology workshop meetup, I invited *Louis Liu* to speak to the community partners about the future trend of Crypto, because he wrote a lot of in-depth articles to introduce Crypto and preach the new technology trend and business logic, I read all his articles and decided to invite him to our event,  he came to Wanxiang's conference and he prepared very detailed materials to explain what web3 is to the partners who attended the meetup, and he predicted that the application chain might explode in the future, and later he slowly enriched his theory and focused on cross-chain and application chain development, and finally established the Near-based [OctopusNetwork](https://oct.network/).\n\n**Application Chain**\n\nWhy do I bring up this story? Because our discussion about application chains at that time slowly turned into a real story, as we all know [AXIE](https://axieinfinity.com/) created its own new chain Robin, and [Defi Kingdoms](https://defikingdoms.com/) on [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) also recently announced a partnership with [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) to launch [DFKchain](https://docs.defikingdoms.com/how-defi-kingdoms-works/defi-kingdoms-blockchain) , which I understand as DFKchain equivalent to Avalanche’s sidechain or parallel chain, but in any case they have launched their own chain, and I predict that many applications will consider this option in the future.\n\n**Create your own public chain**\n\nI made a comment in the [Stepn](https://stepn.com/) community three days ago that I think they should also consider creating their own public chain that fits their product requirement. [Stepn](https://stepn.com/) is a project I really like because I'm a sports fan and have join half marathons events many times. As a participant in the Crypto space, I also expected some great Web3 apps to appear in Crypto industry. **Stepn** was on my watch list at the end of '21 when my friend  mentioned it in one talk show and I accessed their website to check out project information. I was a fans of ***Mable Jiang's podcast***, and later,  I learned the story of the two founders of Stepn on her podcast, which was very, very important for me to understand **Stepn**. Since then I've been following the project's development, becoming a loyal Stepn runner and participating in community discussions.\n\n**Uncritical thinking**\n\nWhen I tried to do an internal transfer after my run 3 days ago, the whole transfer process took 2 hours. This is not the first time this kind of problem happened, and users of Stepn community also faced this trouble long time, and I know that the reason why the chain transfer is full is caused by Solana's network problem. I also consulted with solana engineers about this problem, but there is no good solution.That's why I made a statement in the **Stepn community** that the team need to consider creating their own public chain, and the reasons for developing a new public chain are basically the same as **AXIE** and **DFK**. \n\n***Last night when I finished my activation with stepn, I suddenly remembered the discussion about application chains of meetup in 2018, and I realized that my previous statements in the stepn community were very inappropriate, and now my opinion is Web3 applications should not be urgent to create their own public chains.***\n\n**Why**\n\nThe question of whether Web3 applications should create their own public chains should be discussed in two ways：\n\n1. **Whether the existing public chains can no longer meet the requirements of the application?** Further, the team can determine whether the current public chain will not be able to meet the requirements of the application in the future as well? The usual view is that application chains are faster, lower gas cost, and low cost for users to use, which is a big reason for **AXIE** to leave ETH. Another reason is that it is highly customizable, all parameters can be adjusted, you can modify the execution environment, modify the wallet, the community own on-chain governance, or you can  reach consensus, upgrade the protocol, quickly evolve to adapt to new requirements, or troubleshoot software bugs, etc..For example, Axie Infinity, which has seen an explosion since it went live with its own custom ethereum strategy in April '21 because it reduced transaction costs by several orders of magnitude,and integrated fiat payments in the wallet, that making an explosion of whole protocol , which is the advantage of developing new public chains.\n2. **There is another important question for the team to think about, does the team have the ability to design a more perfect chain**? we know that ETH, Solana, or even certain ZK-rollup projects which  still face scalability issues, speed issues, decentralization issues, security issues now, but they can  solve these pain points  in a short time? Fork and Copy code ,modify parameters，it looks easy to develop a new chain, but running up a public chain that takes a long time and requires huge investment. So creating a new public chain you will still face the same problems in this industry, and the best way to solve the TPS  is to be highly centralized, but this also means a high risk, easy to be manipulated and other problems. Some time ago, we all know that AXIE was attacked. Although Flow and IMX are exploring this direction, it is still difficult to solve the above problems, and now all Layer 1 public chains are trying to solve these problems.\n\n**What to do?**\n\nWaiting and keep attention, keep learning, optimize the speed problem by other methods, such as cross-chain, share part of the pressure to other chains. waiting for the application chain infrastructure to mature and then deploy the product to these chains, such as Defi Kingdoms' attempt on AVAX, or wait for the maturity of Layer2 zk-rollup technology or you can try to based on multi-chain services like *OctopusNetwork*, rather than taking the risk to create new public chain.", "timestamp": 1653381561, "digest": "IYbI_4zMCkV2TclEYPsf1FHiRyK2h95RjcqBhxTt8hU", "contributor": "0xD033feF6d4C75CE2F4878314057C2F959FAB4679"}
{"id": "II3KgxLD_ETC0raeMRPxc9hnMOPxqrLJZgA7vjI3IEI", "title": "DID 与 SocialFi 将走的路：找寻 Web3 的灵魂", "body": "> 作者：Diamond, Diane, Maxwell, Evelyn, Carole, Claire\n> Twitter: <https://twitter.com/D_TigerResearch>\n> Discord: <https://discord.gg/CZCM7WesKS>\n\n## 1. Vitalik 等论文摘要\n\n《去中心化社会：找寻 Web3 的灵魂》是 Vitalik 等人联合发表的最新论文，本文讲述了如何通过 “灵魂绑定” Token（本质上来说就是 DID）来建立一个更加多元、丰富的 Desoc（去中心化社会）。论文内容非常长，本文将对这篇论文的重要观点进行转述与总结，这样读者很快就能了解去中心化社会有关知识了。\n\n### 1.1 Web3成立之初的局限性\n\n在不到十年的时间里，Web3 创造了一个庞大的金融帝国，这一成就令世界瞩目，连 facebook 都以 all in 的形式参与到这场金融盛宴之中。加密和经济领域的基础元素，为金融交易带来了一个丰富、开放且多元的生态系统。但是这个过程中出现了一个矛盾，金融交易的经济价值是由人们现实生活中的社会关系等决定的，也就是说它的内部运转逻辑并不完善甚至可以说并不完整。正是由于 Web3 缺乏代表社会身份的基础元素，它从根本上依赖于它所要超越的中心化的 Web2 结构，这具有非常大的局限性。\n\n这种依赖性在具体应用方面也有很明显的体现：\n\n* 虽然 NFT 通过 Opensea 等去中心化平台进行交易，但是许多 NFT 艺术家会通过 Twitter 等中心化平台进行宣传，以向人们证明其真实性并达到推广的目的\n* 各种去中心化项目经常依赖 Web2 基础设施来实施投票\n* 许多 Web3 参与者依赖 Coinbase 或 Binance 等中心化实体管理的托管钱包\n\n此外由于缺乏原生的 Web3 身份，今天的 DeFi 生态系统无法支持实体经济中普遍存在的活动，如等额抵押贷款甚至超低额抵押贷款（目前加密贷款平台一般只支持超额抵押）或者签订公寓租赁等合同。在此我们试图通过“灵魂绑定”的 Token（“soulbound” tokens，SBTs，也就是 DID 去中心化身份）来打破这些局限。除此以外通过 Web3 社会身份，还可以就财富集中和金融攻击的治理脆弱性等更广泛的长期问题上取得巨大进展，同时刺激 web3 的政治、经济和社会应用的大幅发展。我们把这些用例和它们所促成的更丰富的多元生态系统称为“去中心化社会”（DeSoc）。**本文第二部分会就 web2 的社交与 Desoc 进行对比进一步展示出 Desoc 的一些特点与优势。**\n\n### 1.2 Desoc 的要素与畅想\n\n首先我们应先了解一下 DeSoc 的基本元素，它（“灵魂绑定” Token, SBTs） 围绕着人们持有的不可转让的账户（或钱包），代表着承诺、证书和关系，这种 Token 就像一份扩展的简历。可以简单地把这种东西理解为我们的身份证，有了身份证我们就可以缴纳社保、绑定银行卡等。没有身份证或者说法律认可的身份这些都很难实现，而目前的 web3 就处在这种没有身份证明的困局当中。在这里把起身份证明的东西被称为“灵魂”， 将账户持有的 Token 称为“灵魂 Token”（SBTs）。\n\n想象一下这样一个世界，大多数参与者都有“灵魂 Token”，它对应一系列的关系、会员资格和证书。因此人们不用公开自己的真实身份，就可以让他人看到自己的教育证书，就业历史，或自己的著作或艺术作品的一串哈希值，这种 Token 对相关信息的公开类似于人们在简历中分享关于自己的信息。更重要的是，通过这种身份人们可以互相识别，甚至可以实现目前无法达到的等额抵押、合同签订等。人们甚至可以无纸化，因为数据可以记录一切，并且因为它不可篡改的特点，又让一切变得更加可信。在这些技术的支持下 web3 一定会越来越丰富且美好。\n\n### 1.3 相关实例\n\n**艺术与“灵魂”**\n\n艺术家可以通过“灵魂”将作品与自己连接。当发行可交易的 NFT 时，艺术家可以从他们的“灵魂”中发行 NFT。艺术家的“灵魂”携带的 SBTs 越多，买家就越容易识别出“灵魂”是属于该艺术家的，从而也就能确定 NFT 的真实性。艺术家可以更进一步，在他们的“灵魂”中发布一个链接的 SBTs，证明某个 NFT 是该“系列藏品”的成员。因此，“灵魂”将创造一种可靠的、链上的交易和识别方式。 很明显，它的现实应用还有很多，NFT 艺术家的例子只是其中最具有代表性的。实际上，除了 web3 领域外，它也能有解决一些现实问题，比如知识产权、司法文件真伪判断等。毕竟随着深度造假技术的进步，人类和算法的直接检查将越来越无法检测真实性。虽然区块链的加入使我们能够追踪特定作品的制作时间，但 SBTs 将使我们能够追踪相关内容的社会出处，为我们提供丰富的社会背景，让我们了解发布作品的人的“灵魂”——他们的会员资格、关系、证书的组合。通过这种方式“高仿”可以很容易地被识别出来。\n\n**“灵魂”空投**\n\n在具体说明“灵魂”空投之前我们需要明白空投是什么，以及空投的意义到底是什么？区块链领域的空投是一种将数字货币通过区块链技术大规模分发到一些已有的数字货币钱包上的行为，比如以太币、比特币、EOS.IO 钱包。简单来说就是向广大网友“发钱”的过程。\n\n当面对空投人们会有四种行为：（1）上网搜索相关内容（2）和朋友聊相关内容，使朋友知晓有关信息（3）之前或者之后疯狂注册账号，以获得空投（4）直接无视\n\n空投本身是一种非常流行的营销策略，并不是所谓的“慈善”，因此在上述几种情况中，（3）和（4）属于无效空投，并不能带来实际的收益或者说宣传的效果。而其中的第三条属于危害性最大的一条，也就是常说的女巫攻击。为了避免第三条项目方往往设立许多空投限制，但是很明显并不能完全避免。通过 DID 可以有效解决上述问题，因为项目方可以依据 DID 进行空投，可以有效提高投放的精准性和准确性。\n\n论文中的相关例子还有很多这里就不多做列举了，如果感兴趣可以点击[论文原文](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763)进行细致了解。\n\n很显然，上文那两个所谓的相关实例都还是比较理想化的概念。**本文将于第三部分举出一些现有的比较具有代表性的相关去中心化项目，各位读者可以通过这些例子对相关内容予以把握。同时会在第四部分就上文提到的 DID 的使用、价值和发展前景进行详细的说明。**\n\n### 1.4 结论\n\n通过这篇文章大家可以预见到 Desoc 的美好未来，但同时也需要意识到 DID 只是这一远大历程中的一小步。此外，上面描述的场景只是 DeSoc 对现有项目与应用的强化作用，但是并没有涉及对比如物理、政治、社会以及它们与现实世界的复杂关系的描述，而它们实际上占据了我们现实生活的很大比例。所有这些都表明，上面描绘的远大理想，可能只是 DeSoc 最终形态的“雏形”。**论文中就 SBTs 的威胁与挑战也进行了比较细致的描述，在本文的第五部分将结合现实情况进行细致描写这里就不再细说。**\n\n# 2.  新型社交为何悄然而至\n\n### 2.1 Web2.0 传统社交弊病\n\nWeb2.0本质是平台经济，是以一小撮为代表的垄断性寡头构架，互联网在该阶段变成全民级别应用，聚集了社交、搜索、电商等超级生态应用开发，且每个行业领域龙头公司几乎垄断行业资源和发展上限，这使得Web2公司在拥有最终解释权的情况下去剥削和占有用户资源信息时游刃有余，例如微信和QQ在中国产生的影响力和不可置换性，使得用户无法维护本身利益，用户在Web2.0中更像是平台的附庸而不是服务接收者。而Web3.0是属于Token经济的后端程序革命，其本意是在为非平台内部的生态参与者获取更多的话语权和创造权，并拥有产品本身的价值支配权利，以及隐私性和安全性。一定程度的避免了不平衡的垄断机制。\n\n### 2.2 SocialFi 是 Web3.0 的必要组件\n\nSocialFi的出现是对抗传统社交平台弊端的必要产物，Web2.0 时代的社交平台被各大运营巨头控制，从用户数据中获取商业价值，忽略用户的感受。SocialFi基于区块链技术，用户身份信息的匿名性有助于保护隐私和安全，更有利于解决用户数据的确认问题以及权利下放。\n\n相信随着用户对于隐私以及自由的追求，越来越多的人会投身于Web3.0的世界，在用户渴望加密技术带给的数据主权时也渴望获得自己在这个世界独特的身份和地位。在Web2.0-3.0过渡的过程中，互联网用户需要一些中间件来从简单迁移到复杂，从而从原始空间迁移到元空间。元空间的实现需要从现有的互联网世界出发，利用一系列的Web3.0组件，分批分阶段的迎接新的用户。在尝试了Defi的去中心化资产流、NFT的数字工作价值、发现Gamefi的P2E之后，去中心化的意见发布和个人展示已经下一个需要探索和开发的Web3.0组件，在互联网发展历史中可以发现社交化可以说是网民的刚性需求。\n\n### 2.3 线上数据分析\n\n根据[Zippa](https://www.zippia.com/advice/cryptocurrency-statistics/)的统计以及交易平台和钱包的来源，2018-2020 年全球加密货币用户群增加了近 190%，2021 年进一步加速。 数据的增加可能是由于账户数量的增加以及身份识别的改进，以及在 2021 年特斯拉和万事达卡等公司宣布进军加密货世界等从热度上升带来的用户数量造成的。下图展示了Web3.0近几年来的趋势变化：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jov7Glf5pfabWlpkN1DD0.png?height=482&width=1141)\n\n根据Google Search数据统计，如今的互联网 2.0 使用用户约在 49.5 亿人左右，对标3亿的加密用户都还只是冰山一角。绝大多数的互联网用户都害困在传统社交网络中，让加密应用的热度扩散才是Web 3.0 走向主流用户的最关键一步。\n\n# 3. 理念的实际运用\n\n### 3.1 ENS\n\nENS”，全称 Ethereum Name Service， 是一个基于以太坊区块链的分布式，开放，可扩展的命名系统。简单来说，通过它可以把原本难以记忆的以太坊地址变成自定义的短地址。通过这种方式，人们可以轻易记下有关内容，既可以减少工作的繁琐程度，也可以减少不必要的风险。同时让用户可以通过以太坊账户和 ENS 配置文件控制自己的数字身份，不再依赖于传统的“中介”。\n\n**技术**\n\n这往往是在注册中心和解析器实现的：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KxP_2muLbCWAntIOITBtl.png?height=458&width=486)\n\nENS注册中心由一个智能合约组成，该合约维护所有域和子域的列表，并存储所有域和子域的三个关键信息：\n\n* 域的所有者\n* 域的解析器\n* 域下所有记录的缓存时间\n\nENS 注册中心作用很简单，只是为了从名称映射到负责它的解析器。解析器负责将名称转换为地址。任何有相关功能的合约都可以作为ENS中的解析器。\n\n在ENS中解析名称有两个步骤：首先，询问注册中心是哪个解析器负责该名称，其次，请该解析器回答查询。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/duhbK48dgxF77doKkPN3t.png?height=254&width=467)\n\n比如，我们试图找到\"foo. eth\"指向的以太坊地址。首先，我们询问注册中心哪个解析器负责“foo. eth”。然后，我们向解析器查询“foo. eth\"的地址。\n\n**数据**（截止至2022-05-23）\n\nDiscord关注：4万+\n\nTwitter关注：18.3万\n\n数据显示，以太坊域名服务商 ENS 在 5 月份以来的收入已经达到了 802 万美元，创下今年以来的新高。今年以来 ENS 已经累计获得了 4864 万美元的收入。\n\n**小结**\n\n通过运作流程可以看出来，整个过程并不会侵害用户的隐私，但是又为加密交易和地址记忆提供了便利条件。V神曾评论说：“ENS是迄今为止最成功的非金融类以太坊应用程序，基本可以类比为一个去中心化的电话册”。很明显它是前文所提到的 Desoc 的一个现实应用和技术支撑，随着行业的发展具有非常巨大的发展潜力。\n\n### 3.2 Bright ID\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wuZhsWQvRKNVOjwoLfTC_.png?height=609&width=1920)\n\nBrightID 是 Web3.0 用户的身份系统，基于以太坊开发，它是完全独立于传统和互联网身份认证的系统。一般用于DAPP用户验证；活动验证；信誉构建等。\n\n具有以下特点：\n\n无门槛：任何人都有权利拥有 Bright ID。\n\n隐私性：Bright ID 不会向用户索取或捕获任何个人隐私信息。\n\n开源：公共产品，完全免费且开源。\n\n**运作和验证方式**\n\nBrightID需要经过人脸和多人认证的方式来通过审核。认证结合链下会议视频等非隐私信息渠道的方式，采用视频会议的形式，由以上六位验证官负责主持验证会议并进行验证工作。验证会议的具体时间日历可在 BrightID 官网查看。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gp05mZ9Gx-tgYSiH2uGga.png?height=354&width=1280)\n\n**相关数据**\n\n融资信息\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BmJ3Z3sIoWc7xg5mA4WAk.png?height=70&width=514)\n\nMetaCartel 是一个由软件工程师、创业者以及以太坊爱好者构建的去中心化社区。他们在全球拥有600多名成员，他们具有丰富的领域经验和专业技能。已经为很多此领域最受欢迎的新兴项目提供了早期资金：Mintbase；Known Origin；Kickback；RocketNFT；Gelato Finance等。\n\n数据分析(截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注：13.2K\n\nAPP 融合：13款\n\nBright ID 用户：57K+\n\n**合作方：**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ySb7HH2E3tUyY-Zz9BFgX.png?height=471&width=1323)\n\n**小结**\nBrightID 在Web3.0时代扮演着很重要的角色，DAPP&APP、活动组织都采用 BrightID 进行身份验证。但这仅仅是 BrightID 潜力的一小部分，随着 BrightID 产品的迭代，以及其构建的信任网络不断扩大，将成就 BrightID 无限的可能性。\n\n### 3.3 MetaMask\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0n_GpHSQzK8HF-UjI7TT-.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nMetaMask，又或是人们口中常说的“小狐狸”钱包，日益成为加密圈内不可或缺的工具，你的钱包地址在一定程度上，可以代表你个人在链上的身份。\n\nMetaMask是一个通过web2互联网浏览器就能访问，且以低门槛与以太坊网络进行交互的工具钱包。它是Consensys目前面对终端用户的唯一产品，是以太坊最早的钱包之一，也是目前用户量最大的钱包。始于2015年，长期以网页端、免费、“半官方”的形态为大众所熟知，属于非托管型钱包。随着2020年Defi应用热潮与2021年NFT的火爆市场效应，MetaMask的用户量极速增长。2020年新增手机客户端和交易功能（名为Swap）。2021年5月推出MetaMask机构版，让机构用户能将MetaMask与机构级托管结合、方便工作流管理、易于汇报等。\n\n但起初，MetaMask其实并不是作为钱包插件之类的消费者项目，而是希望成为一种开发工具。Metamask母公司，是以太坊联合创始人Joseph Lubin所创办的区块链巨头公司之一的ConsenSys。ConsenSys 是以太坊重点项目的企业孵化器，旗下的MetaMask是ConsenSys布局的六大业务板块基础设施板块的重点项目。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YnjEZyE-akF8hkOslm1UO.png?height=188&width=839)\n\n**技术**\n\n现MetaMask已兼容绝大部分的区块链网络Dapp（包括Ethereum、Binance、Polygon），可集成托管解决方案来管理秘钥存储和多重签名批准。团队也在逐步优化产品本身，简化交易流程、减少交易费用、签字程序等。并逐步提升其合规能力，让钱包内可以进行高风险评估，安全进行去中心化和匿名交易等。\n对于大量的用户选择MetaMask作为迈入Web3的第一步，团队除了打磨好产品，提升钱包本身的安全性能，用户友好度之外。面对发展迅猛的加密货币行业，使用需求量的暴增与跨网络的需求都是不可忽视的问题。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pzMu5CxfcUo_ekJI1Ma9l.png?height=419&width=1445)\n\n**相关数据（截止到2022-05-23）**\n\n**Twitter关注**：75.4 K\n\n**融资情况**：2022-03-16，ConsenSys 完成4.5亿美元D轮融资，完成最新一轮融资后，ConsenSys的估值超过70亿美元，比2021年11月完成2亿美元C 轮融资时的估值增加一倍以上。ConsenSys首席执行官Joe Lubin在接受Decrypt采访时表示，MetaMask很快将推出DAO并发行代币。新的DAO并不会参与管理MetaMask，但将为MetaMask的更新提供资金。可见，MetaMask的资金储备是比较充足的。\n\n**其他数据**：\n\n根据公开数据，截止目前，MetaMask的月活跃用户已达到3000万。而巅峰时期的以太坊全网活跃地址也才只有 800 万左右。不难看出，Meta钱包的月活跃数量远超于此，也印证了MetaMask钱包现在已经成为了大量加密的首选。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZijDJTKGeNWtZC7Higmnt.png?height=804&width=1526)\n\n截止到2022年3月份，MetaMask插件的下载了超过1,000,000，目前日活跃用户大概在6k-8k左右，每日新用户超过2K+。目前加密货币钱包类用户早已超过8000万，对于一些出现的维护问题，团队已出现了棘手的情况。\n\n相较于互联网46亿的活跃用户来说，加密货币未来的将拥有更广阔的市场。目前MetaMask主要支持以太坊和各种EVM链，未来若想跨接到Solana等多生态，团队将如何开拓和维系其服务，值得期待。\n\n**小结**\n\n如今，MetaMask的使用已相当普及，这似乎已成为了进入Web3的第一步——生成你的去中心化钱包地址。而钱包也逐渐成为区块链世界中的一种身份象征，作为用户使用频率最高的小狐狸钱包，swap与NFT购买，是其最常用的两个功能。也因为以太坊生态中任何一个应用，都会支持MetaMask，两者的发展相辅相成，逐渐将钱包地址与Web3世界里去中心化个人身份的划上等号。\n未来，伴随着多链时代的到来，通用钱包的概念或将被逐渐被弱化，取而代之的可能是针对性更强的点对点产品服务，如专门的NFT钱包，打金钱包等。随着时间的推移，MetaMask自身以及新生代的钱包的发展都同样值得期待\n\n### 3.4 CyberConnect\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eXmS6-XLpYtKe3eZn9mQm.png?height=77&width=346)\n\nCyberconnect旨在解决社交图表（Social Graph）再分配问题，这个问题其实很好去解释，就是说Web2.0中各种平台的信息无法互通，造成重复资源浪费且难以找到各种志同道合的用户，社交图谱相对单一。\n\n而Cyberconnect所表明的内涵或者本质也很简单（用户之间的关系不仅仅是双向或者三向的，更是各种交叉和重叠的混合网络关系）例如A本身，与A关注的用户，和关注A的用户进行不同连线组合，形成一张独特的“图谱”，证明该用户的社交关系网，而从这些与用户A有联系的人又重新编织，又将形成新的图谱。这样网络世界中拥有相同的兴趣爱好的用户，同游戏玩家，商品贸易中的的买家卖家等通过社交图谱逐渐变得清晰。**如此一来，CyberConnect 便打破了不同平台之间的壁垒。**\n\n**技术**\n\n关于数据和存储：CyberConnect社交图数据存储时使用的IPFS和无许可协议Ceramic构建，联通Ceramic区块链锚定和自定义数据固定服务，可以保证CyberConnect链上数据长期存储。（使用Ceramic DID方法）关于用户数据在不同的平台如何集成，则需要采用Ceramic身份协议IDX，它为开发人员提供一个统一的界面，在CyberConnect内部查询这些数据分析，反过来CyberConnect也会给与DID链上系统提供更多的身份数据。\n\n与其它项目集成：同时CyberConnect还会与其它Web3项目集成获取信息，例如NFT平台Foundation与Rarible等，其实最重要的一点是让玩家通过一个统一的身份来参与不同种类的生态应用，同时也能与Web2链接使链上和链下数据结合起来成为更强大的去中心化数据提供商。\n\n**相关数据：**(数据截止到2022-05-23）\n\nTwitter关注数：57,7k+\n\n生态项目数：30+\n\n入驻用户：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a7o2JaOaNfPgndwT2sSm3.png?height=108&width=679)\n\n融资消息：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MKRShXhLUbStaV7wGpQdV.png?height=127&width=685)\n\n其中的Multicoin曾投资过Near Protocol、Solana、Helium、Duna Analytics、Audius等潜力新兴区块链或者具有足够实际应用的优质Web3.0应用，此次Cyberconnect也正是该机构看好未来web3社交领域的潜力而开展的首次社交应用投资，证明该赛道的早期成长属性和该项目未来价值发掘。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SgkZfhUF3wFkZo_i2RlCP.png?height=542&width=1145)\n\n**小结**\n\n社交化图标也是DID最核心应用场景之一。毕竟身份的重要程度随着社交功能完善等比例增长。虽然目前Cyberconnect已经接入Solana、Ethereum、Binance网络链，在用户体验感上来说，以太坊网络链是功能较完善且操作流畅，但部分操作功能在Solana上还处于开发阶段，不仅容易在网络上造成拥堵而且需要使用不同的钱包插件，使得用户体验感下降。\n\n作为一个去中心化的社交图谱协议，为Web3.0社会网络和元宇宙服务，CyberConnect还需要在前进的道路上完成更多的目标。\n\n### 3.5 Mirror\n\n提到去中心化的写作平台，大部分区块链用户都会脱口而出“Mirror”，其平台在成立不到一年就被联合广场风险投资公司估值1亿美元，获1千万美元投资。作为去中心化的写作平台赛道代表——Mirror 是依靠哪些去中心化特性和功能”荣登“宝座呢？\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jylJj2d9u5m_YMYfOnvQA.png?height=601&width=865)\n\n**功能简介**\n\nMirror 跟中心化的写作平台最大的不同是，他具备加密区块链产品的特性和功能。参与用户无需通过邮箱账号，手机号码，社交帐户等中心化的身份验证手段来注册账号，只需要绑定自己的0x开头的钱包地址即可生成独一无二的“作者专栏”，类似于上文所提及的ENS（以太坊域名）。对于部分创作者来说，跟外界的接触仅仅由一串小小的字符连接，完美的融合了去中心化身份的理念。\n\n除此之外，创作者可以在Mirror平台上发布文章/创作图片等作品，每一件公开发布的作品不是保存在中心化服务器上，而是透过区块链存储专案Arweave进行链上的数据保存，经用户进行加密签名后生成一段哈希值记录，将作品永久的保存在区块链上。Mirror上更是支持创作者将自己的作品铸造成NFT，让原先没有边际成本、可被无限复制的内容作品具有稀缺性，从而被赋予价值。不仅无法被他人复制或修改，而且可以在各大NFT市场上进行售卖。\n\n其次，Mirror 也提供读者募资功能，读者喜欢的文章可以直接使用加密货币”打赏“创作者；共同的创作者可以按照设定好的盈利比例来获取各自部分的收益；以及其平台上的作品拍卖功能等等。\n\n**技术**\n\nMirror 在保存用户文章时使用的两类 Web3 组件，一个是用于对文章进行永久存储的 Arweave，另一个是用于对文章进行确权与交易的 NFT 铸造平台以太坊主网。\n\n1. Mirror 的存储组件-Arweave，是一条针对存储进行了底层性能优化的公链，因此用户在 Arweave 链上存储数据的成本相较其他智能合约公链平台有极大的降低。同时，链上存储的特征保证了在 Arweave 之上存储数据的永久性，因此，基于 Arweave 的存储模式也常被归类为永久存储。创作者在保存文章修改的时候，Mirror 会在后台自动对新的文章进行二次上链存储。\n2. Mirror 的确权组件，在存储的同时，通常会需要另一组 Web3 组件，以便对存储的内容进行确权，也就是将内容铸造为 NFT 格式的资产。但此步骤是在以太坊网络上以 NFT 的形式进行确权，成本由创作者自行承担支付。\n\n**相关数据（截至2022-05-23）**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KBnzoyVFQarlyXYYy6q9Q.png?height=70&width=698)\n\n**小结**\n\n去中心化创作平台-Mirror 的核心创新点很多，打破了传统创作平台的束缚，将NFT，社区DAO，Write-Fi相结合的经济模型，解决了部分去中心化平台所追求的“通过创作内容实现价值变现”的难题，相信 Mirror 这样肩负着去中心化任务的创作平台也会在迈向 WEB3.0 的道路上越走越远。\n\n### 3.6 Project Galaxy\n\nProject Galaxy 的愿景是想要打造一个最大的 Web3 数据凭证（credential data）网络，建造一个开放协作数据聚合基础设施，助力开发者和项目方建造更好的产品和社区。项目方在 Project Galaxy 平台上面为用户创建并奖励 NFT，用户完成项目方的任务，比如在链上进行特定的交互、参加会议、关注推特、加入 Discord 社区、提交问卷、参与测试等方式获得NFT。\n\n**技术：**\n\nProject Galaxy 目前支持两种方式来提供数据凭证 GraphQL 和 REST API。Galaxy上有两个角色，分别是数据贡献者和使用者。数据贡献者可以用子图查询或静态快照（subgraph queries or static snapshots）的方式贡献链上数据，同时在链下，Galaxy 也集成了信息来源，比如推特和 GitHub。\n\n数据使用者使用 Application module, Credential Oracle Engine, and Credential API 三种方式使用数据。并使用 Galaxy 的代币 $GAL 支付，因此数据贡献者可以获得激励。\n\n**相关数据**：\n\n已入驻项目方：400+\n\nGalaxy ID 用户：170 万+\n\nTwitter关注：30 万+\n\n融资情况：2021 年 5 月种子轮融资，2022年1月由 Multicoin Capital 和 Dragonfly Capital 领投、多个机构参投的 1000 万美元融资。随后 2 月在 CoinList 平台公募获得 1500 万美元。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gZN7tj9iV2lHWkssLK7Z3.png?height=500&width=1500)\n\nProject Galaxy上线时间为2021年5月，运行不到一年，活跃用户量远大于同类型的项目 POAP 和 Rabbithole 。2021 年底银河女孩系列 NFT 活动让 Project Galaxy 一举成名，银河女孩 NFT 持有者更是获得了该项目原生代币 $GAL 在 CoinList 平台上公募的优先队列名额。后续 Meta Cowboy，Dr.SOL 等系列 NFT 持有者也获得了 $GAL 空投。\n\n**小结**\n\nProject Galaxy 无疑是一个非常成功的项目。链上身份凭证和数字身份一直都有市场需求，Project Galaxy 作为多链项目满足了市场在这方面的需求，为整个加密生态系统提供服务。在经历 Defi Summer 和 NFT Summer 之后 ，它抓住了 Crypto 项目方频繁使用 NFT 作为用户激励工具的需求。它给项目方提供了发放 NFT 奖励活动的工具和用户流量资源，初步形成了项目方和项目方之间，项目方和用户之间，用户和用户之间的多重网络效应。\n\n# 4. 新型社交的展望\n\n### 最初的载体与未来场景？\n\n绝大部分用户最熟悉DID理念实际运用应该是区块链钱包，例如Metamask是作为用户接入整个区块链的入口端，具有隐私性、安全性、不可追踪性。这是DID赛道最初应用成果，但是其缺点也很明确。钱包地址的注册缺少独特性，一个人可以注册大量毫无价值的钱包。其次大钱包只能显示代币难以展示NFT和参与证明等未来势必流行的资产，更不用说SBT所畅享的“无纸化”证明，这是钱包的局限性。第三钱包无法配置资产可编程属性，无法限制其他人查看钱包资产，从而导致黑客攻击情况发生。不过理念的实践是处于不断完善的过程。现在已经出现了可以展示NFT和参与证明（POA）的去中心化身份应用，还有隐私赛道对于钱包和其它DID应用进行代币隐私化、资产可视化等功能赋能等，预计不短时间内所有区块链赛道应用可以进行用户DID绑定，可记录用户等额抵押、合同签订、参与证明和哈希参数等不可篡改的数据，潜在提升单一用户DID价值\n\n从结构和理论上来阐述，有社交的地方更加注重身份特征，所以从根本属性上来说SocialFi就是实现该理念的最初赛道，只有用户们尝试并参与进来，才能够从本质上理解DID在区块链各赛道中重要程度，在未来去中心化社交领域当中，寻找相同理念思想的用户从而构建和谐关系，通过新兴匹配技术进行身份特征快速转移和整合，快速的梳理出用户兴趣爱好与社交圈，可以大程度的减少网络中诈骗行为，提高社交沟通交流效率。\n\n### 如何评估用户DID价值赋能？\n\n未来DID账号的价值根据其内部的资产总数和分配比例，如加密货币、NFT、参与证明等进行价值评估，以及个人身份信息验证，与其他用户之间互动，评论留言等进行附加属性评估。最后就是项目之间的筛选机制和会员资格评判，如拥有某些NFT或者证明的用户获得相应空投奖励、参与测试的资格等，这些都进一步的丰富了DID整体价值属性。\n\n对于目前市场来说，DID基础设施赛道仍未出现热点项目能引领该赛道的热潮，例如DeFi的火热是Uniswap带领的，GameFi的出圈前者与Axie有关，后者StepN再次引领，所以扩大潜在用户群体还需要落实到实际具体项目当中，单一可行的理念是无法吸引到足够的投资者的。\n\nDID赛道本身是没有主动生产价值的能力，创建了钱包地址不代表钱包有钱，但是从另一角度来说DID也是最能兼容区块链中所有领域的基础设施，其价值决定极大程度上基于与其它项目应用的兼容，毕竟DID属于后端程序，与个性化应用并不冲突。\n\n### 趋势预测\n\n在如今整体环境影响下，以NFT和GameFi赛道为首的炒作属性偏高的赛道整体估值下降较多，新用户和资金参与量明显下跌，而以Web 3.0等基础设施属性较强的底层架构融资情况增长。可以明确的是DID与SocialFi等赛道会长时间处于发展道路中，寻找相关实际应用和价值层次赋能，且随着未来涌入区块链赛道的用户会越来越多，下一个牛市用户数量可能会达到三到五倍的增幅，用户之间的社交属性和凭证需求会随着用户数等比例增长，所以目前早期部署该赛道，其未来潜力也是无法估量的。\n\n# 5. DID 与 SocialFi 发展过程中可能的挑战\n\nDID 赛道 和 SocialFi 目前处于早期探索阶段，有着巨大的发展前景，隐藏着许多仍未被发掘的机会，但同时也有着不少问题等待 Web3 建设者们去挑战：\n\n* 不可转让这一概念本身就存在着技术上的挑战，在限制或防止转移的需求和区块链生态系统之间有着难以跨越的障碍，因为目前来说，几乎所有的项目标准都是围绕着最大可转移性来设计的。\n* 隐私是此类生态系统良好运作的一个重要前提。许多情况下，用户并不希望透露他们所有的身份信息。去中心化的身份信息如何做到仅在必要的时候披露给必要的对象，也是在技术上所面临的一大挑战。\n\n一个只规范资本而不规范人类个人行为的制度可能只会无情地服务于金钱而非人类本身。我们作为 Web3 的参与者和建设者，需要更多的思考和更多的努力来解决这些挑战。而如果我们能够成功解决，则为区块链那些并非只关注金钱的生态系统，打开了一扇通往更为广阔天地的大门。\n\n## 参考资料\n\n1.

Các khoản đầu tư nổi tiếng trong danh mục đầu tư của công ty bao gồm nhà phát triển trò chơi và ứng dụng Dapper Labs, nhà lãnh đạo trao đổi tài sản kỹ thuật số OpenSea và công ty dữ liệu CryptoSlam.\n\nAmimoca phát triển các trò chơi, cho phép người chơi mua và bán các tài sản kỹ thuật số duy nhất được gọi là mã thông báo không thể thay thế (NFT) trên blockchain. NFT, có thể bao gồm đồ sưu tầm và ảnh đại diện trong thế giới game, là ưu tiên hàng đầu của Siu. Ông nói: “Chúng tôi đang cố gắng đầu tư vào bất cứ thứ gì tiếp tục hỗ trợ việc xây dựng các hiệu ứng mạng của NFT. \n \n\nNhững người hoài nghi đặt câu hỏi về nhu cầu xây dựng trò chơi điện tử trên blockchain. Các nhà phê bình cũng chỉ ra rằng NFT, được những kẻ lừa đảo sử dụng tự do để thực hiện giao dịch giả mạo và các hình thức gian lận khác, đang ngày càng làm xói mòn niềm tin của nhà đầu tư.\n\nTrong một cuộc phỏng vấn vào ngày 19 tháng 5 trên chương trình \"Crypto DeFined\" của TruthDAO, có sẵn trên Fireside, Siu đã chọn về những chủ đề này và các chủ đề khác, bao gồm cả triển vọng vẫn lạc quan của anh ấy về NFT, vốn gần đây đang đánh bại thị trường.\n\nNăm thông tin chi tiết hàng đầu từ Siu: \n  \n *Stablecoin sẽ được hưởng lợi từ quy định.*\n\nTheo cách Siu nhìn nhận, quy định là cách đáng tin cậy duy nhất để tạo niềm tin trên diện rộng vào thị trường stablecoin: “Một khi mọi người biết rằng điều này được các cơ quan chính phủ quản lý và ban phước, nó sẽ thúc đẩy việc áp dụng hàng loạt,” ông dự đoán.\n\n*Sự sụt giảm tiền điện tử là một cơ hội mua cho Animoca.*\n\n“Nếu bạn tin như chúng tôi. . . rằng đây là lần lặp lại tiếp theo của Internet… đầu tư ngay bây giờ hoặc thậm chí sau này không phải là một vấn đề lớn, ”ông nói. “Tôi không nghĩ về những gì sẽ xảy ra trong năm tới. Tôi đang nghĩ về những gì sẽ xảy ra trong 10 đến 20 năm tới. ”\n\n*Trẻ em là cánh cửa vào tương lai.*\n\n“Hãy hỏi trẻ xem chúng muốn gì vào Giáng sinh hoặc sinh nhật của chúng và đó có thể là thứ gì đó kỹ thuật số,” Siu chỉ ra. “Họ không nhất thiết muốn đôi giày đó hoặc món đồ thời trang đó - họ muốn thứ gì đó từ Roblox hoặc Fortnite.”\n\nTại sao điều đó lại quan trọng: “Theo quan điểm của tôi, việc nhìn vào hành vi và mong muốn của con cái chúng ta thực sự là một lăng kính cho tương lai. . . Đó là lý do tại sao, trong lĩnh vực công nghệ, mọi người đều tập trung vào giới trẻ… bởi vì họ cho thấy tương lai sẽ đi về đâu về mặt hành vi và mong muốn ”. \n  \n *Web3 kết hợp với nghiên cứu chất lượng sẽ đẩy lùi những tác nhân xấu.*\n\n“Chúng tôi đang ở thời điểm mà không gian đang phát triển và ngày càng có nhiều người chơi có trách nhiệm tham gia,” Siu khẳng định. “Thay vì một cơ quan trung ương đang cố gắng giữ mọi người có trách nhiệm giải trình, thực sự bản chất phi tập trung (của tiền điện tử) đang giữ mọi người chịu trách nhiệm theo một cách khác.”\n\n~~Theo Siu, hiệu ứng Darwin đã phát huy tác dụng: “Nếu bạn đã tham gia vào nhiều dự án mà kết quả là không tốt, thì khả năng khởi động các dự án NFT khác của bạn trở nên khó hơn… Đây là một quá trình trưởng thành” rằng hiện đang diễn ra trên toàn thế giới tiền điện tử.~~\n\nTại sao điều đó lại quan trọng: Các dự án được hỗ trợ bởi các nhà đầu tư có uy tín “là một cách để xác nhận rằng chúng là có thật, rằng quá trình thẩm định đã xảy ra, rằng chúng là xác thực. (Các nhà đầu tư) biết rằng sẽ không có một cuộc kéo thảm. \" \n  \n *Blockchain là một môi trường lý tưởng để chơi game.*\n\nTrong thế giới 2.0, sức hấp dẫn hàng loạt chính là điểm xuất sắc. Các nhà phát triển trò chơi thực sự cần hàng triệu người chơi để đạt được trạng thái lớn. Trong web3, điều đó không nhất thiết phải như vậy.\n\nSiu giải thích: “Phần lớn các trò chơi Blockchain chỉ có hàng trăm nghìn người dùng hoạt động hàng ngày. Tuy nhiên, họ thúc đẩy nền kinh tế trị giá hàng tỷ đô la. Đó là bởi vì có nhiều hiệu quả hơn về vốn. \"\n\n“Điều đó có nghĩa là bây giờ chúng tôi có một khuôn khổ (web3) nơi chúng tôi có thể có nội dung đa dạng mà không phụ thuộc vào việc tạo ra một trò chơi chỉ có sức hấp dẫn đại chúng.” Theo Siu, điều đó mở ra rất nhiều cánh cửa - và cơ hội tài chính - cho các nhà phát triển thuộc mọi quy mô trên toàn thế giới tiền điện tử.\n\nBạn có thể xem lại toàn bộ cuộc phỏng vấn tại đây. \n  \n *According to <https://truthdao(dots)news/animoca-brands-co-founder-yat-siu-still-bullish-on-nfts/>*", "timestamp": 1653380907, "digest": "MboDeJEMkc6RmJsGXhwhZpZhLUu2HI01i08Cf5l5-Ds", "contributor": "0xC85e1894400ee5651A634694067aC605212A8B95"}

The team aims to create a multi-blockchain Medieval Metaverse without boundaries. Players will engage in fierce battles of skills to protect their realms and gain tremendous rewards such as resources, territories, world domination, and so on.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nPlayers are given a choice of heroes to pair them, customize their powers, and adjust their own playstyle. Cryowar has a skill-based gampley, and provides the players with 9 main game modes. At the start of every match, CRYOWAR randomly cycles through a pool of level objectives changing on the fly. Players need to be prepared to instantly adapt to whatever the game throws at them. Each round lasts for about 3 minutes. \n\n**Tokenomics**\n\n**Allocation**\n\n$CWAR is the utility token of the CRYOWAR gaming ecosystem at large. A total of 1,000,000,000 CWAR tokens are minted in order to facilitate a sustainable in-game economy. The token can be used to buy NFTs (such as skins), and virtual land plots. The CWAR token is also set to be the official currency to buy tournament tickets in Cryowar.\n\nThe following figure is the detailed allocation info of CWAR. Notably, staking and rewards take up 45% of the total supply, which serves as a great incentive for its players to get involved in the game. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vUfUExN6jVRLAnIKY-6gA.png?height=325&width=377)\n\nUnlock Cycle\n\nAs illustrated in the following figure, the selling price of CWAR at Seed Round, Private Round, and Public Sale are $0.014, $0.018, and $0.028 respectively. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UQc71hgJg000W7d1JpQtC.png?height=369&width=531)\n\nCWAR is 10% unlocked at TGE in the Seed Round and Private Round, while 20% unlocked at TGE in Public Sale with the rest 80% a monthly linear vesting for the next 6 months. Thefore, the percentage of token unlocking at TGE is realatively low. The current market price (by 2022/5/12) of CWAR sits at around $0.047.\n\nIn public sale, the total funding amount was $620,000. The number of CWAR on sale was 22.9 million, of which 4.58 million was unlocked at TGE. The total earning was around 9 million, which gives the holders a 1452% return at best.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9gezQGj2lKkoQcDNsuyeB.png?height=430&width=564)\n\n**Burning Mechanism**\n\n   The team will also implement several deflationary techniques in order to keep the game economy stable, such as token burns. CWAR tokens will be burned through various methods, including in-game marketplace and tournament buy-in fees, with the added benefit of attracting new players and hyping the release of new gaming content.\n\n**Staking**\n\nPlayers are able to earn a certain percentage of rewards by staking $CWAR. The team provided holders with two pools to choose from. \n\nCryowar Gold Pool: 4 months lock period. Participants will receive a variable APY with high incentivised rewards: airdrop for first believers in terms of NFTs + small chances for random rewards.\n\nCryowar Diamond Pool: 12 months lock-up period. Participants will receive a variable APY with high incentivized rewards: airdrop for first believers in terms of NFTs + randomized rewards in terms of Skins, and 3rd party rewards.\n\n**NFT Introduction**\n\nThere will be various NFTs in Cryowar. All of the NFTs are still being worked on by now. It is expected that skin NFTs can be anticipated after the delivery of the NFT lands and open Beta.\n\n**Community**\n\n![(Till 2022/5/10)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nHtOScSdvMfpeg9-MoMoE.png?height=134&width=522)\n\nAs a project with a relatively large fan base, its member engagement doesn’t really follow through. Although its mods answer members’ questions timely, there simply just aren’t many interactions going on in its Discord and Telegram community. With an average likes and comments that rounds up to less than 250, the same situation applies to its Twitter posts.\n\n**Investors and Team**\n\nThe Dev team behind Cryowar are professionals in game design, blockchain development, security, cloud infrastructures and networking with more than 20 years experience. Some big names in the blockchain industry can also be found in its partner list, Animoca Brands, Polygon, for example.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8g5M4qWnJUaNNB-_iczdS.png?height=181&width=553)\n\n**Author:** **@BitMetis** **| BitReport**\n\nYour Source of Reliable, Unbiased Research and Due Diligence\n\n**BitMetis Review：**\n\n**Gameplay： PVP, PVE, Skill-based battle gameplay**\n\n**Tokenomics: $CWAR, decent token mechanism design, clear issuance cycle.

It is created based on Sun Yitian's diptych \"Flying at Dusk\". The image of the owl is generated according to the artistic creation model. Combined with the binding of data actions, a unique story is generated and permanently stored on the blockchain. The creation is inspired by the owl of Minerva, the goddess of wisdom in Roman mythology, which is a symbol of thought and reason. The white owls only appear at night, and the black owls only appear during the day. They chase each other, but never meet each other because of the reversal of time. The black and white owls seem to be two independent individuals, but in a certain sense, one is a clone of the other, and at a certain moment, a metaphor of identity begins. In the process of Owl's philosophical speculation, meaningless data will also be built into a new ideology with the artist's algorithm.\n\n**Artist Introduction**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FNM9_7xZaKsc26GJNAo7P.png?height=720&width=1080)\n\n\nSun Yitian (b. 1991 in Zhejiang, China) graduated from the painting department of China Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing (CAFA) in 2015 and earned her Masters at the same academy in 2018.

{"id": "6wj1oA8k8m11eb7HOhTqgHS-JEWmfMbORc8AynilFkA", "title": "What is Web3? Enough to read this\n", "body": "```\nAs a new protocol to describe the realization of decentralized consensus, since its appearance in 2014, Web3 has gradually become synonymous with public chain ecology, applications and even design concepts. Like other new concepts, the question of \"What is Web3?\" The new terminology may be unfamiliar to some people, so in this blog post, we introduce Web3 in 9 parts, together with some practical cases, so that you can better understand them in practice.\n```\n\n## 1. Web3 is a new term for the decentralized web\r\n\n```\nSince 2015, ConsenSys founder and CEO Joseph Lubin has been speaking, writing, and funding teams building Web3 and the decentralized web. The Web3 philosophy is the touchstone that guides all of ConsenSys’ early investments and projects. MetaMask is the primary way for individual users to access the Ethereum blockchain today, but there are, of course, many other Ethereum-compatible networks. It's a way to securely generate a public key on your phone or computer, but it uses a new norm of web interaction - only you have access to your account and data, and can choose what to share and what to keep private. Others liken MetaMask to an encrypted version of a consent manager.\n\nWhen we refer to the decentralized web, in addition to decentralized currency and identity, we also refer to other parts of the related technology stack. For example, for file persistent storage (such as IPFS and Arweave), decentralized storage (Golem, W3BCloud, etc.) and decentralized data (graph protocol), decentralized storage is becoming an indispensable part of the decentralized network .\n\nRight now, Web3 is the direction a16z and other big VCs are keen on, which means there are plenty of people on Twitter mocking, sarcastic, and even confusing. It's only a matter of time before Web3 takes its place in the public internet discussion, when these clowns may return to serve as evangelists.\n```\n\n## 2. Web1 is read-only, Web2 is read-write, Web3 is read-write + has information\r\n\n```\nWhen I asked a fellow Web3 developer how he would explain Web3, the short answer he gave was: Web1 is read-only, Web2 is read-write, and Web3 is read-write-own. The initial versions of the web were built on open source protocols such as TCP, IP, SMTP, and of course HTTP. Protocols are used as a standard way of allowing multiple computers to communicate with each other. These underlying protocols govern the flow of information and messages on the Internet, and if you want to build an application or service based on the rules of these protocols, there is no charge.\n\nWeb2 is a second-generation product built using free and open-source protocols on the Internet. The big shift that Web2 brought from the static, read-only Web1 website was that individual users could publish content to the Internet. What started as likes on Digg message boards has morphed into Weibo and now Facebook with more than 2 billion users. Another subtle change is that users don't need to maintain their own servers to keep their websites running, and Web2 companies bear the associated costs. But at the same time, they also created an information silo of user data, behavior, and activity to build a social graph with great advertising value. In the Web2 era, individual users are products.\n```\n\n[https://app.cyberconnect.me/address/0x024695E5Df5Ed0EF6b44668757d52Bd18C5981b5](https://app.cyberconnect.me/address/0x024695E5Df5Ed0EF6b44668757d52Bd18C5981b5)\n\n \n  \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1653381606, "digest": "iw1Zy0eejSkTZ5MDQKEHQXbdpdRvFTHCx_c4Nj_l00c", "contributor": "0x024695E5Df5Ed0EF6b44668757d52Bd18C5981b5"}

I believe it deserves to be available on Mirror as well. Minds that shaped the Web3 space should also be present on the Permaweb.\n\nHave a good read.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RplnSVTzvnU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RplnSVTzvnU)\n\n*“Economists have been exploring people's behavior for hundreds of years: how we make decisions, how we act individually and in groups, how we exchange value. They've studied the institutions that facilitate our trade, like legal systems, corporations,marketplaces. But there is a new, technological institution that will fundamentally change how we exchange value, and it's called the blockchain.*\n\n*Now, that's a pretty bold statement, but if you take nothing else away from this talk, I actually want you to remember that while blockchain technology is relatively new, it's also a continuation of a very human story, and the story is this. As humans, we find ways to lower uncertainty about one another so that we can exchange value.*\n\n*Now, one of the first people to really explore the idea of institutions as a tool in economics to lower our uncertainties about one another and be able to do trade was the Nobel economist Douglass North.He passed away at the end of 2015, but North pioneered what's called \"new institutional economics.\" And what he meant by institutions were really just formal rules like a constitution, and informal constraints, like bribery. These institutions are really the grease that allow our economic wheels to function, and we can see this play out over the course of human history.*\n\n*If we think back to when we were hunter-gatherer economies, we really just traded within our village structure. We had some informal constraints in place, but we enforced all of our trade with violence or social repercussions. As our societies grew more complex and our trade routes grew more distant, we built up more formal institutions, institutions like banks for currency, governments, corporations. These institutions helped us manage our trade as the uncertainty and the complexity grew, and our personal control was much lower. Eventually with the internet, we put these same institutions online. We built platform marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, just faster institutions that act as middlemen to facilitate human economic activity.*\n\n*As Douglass North saw it, institutions are a tool to lower uncertainty so that we can connect and exchange all kinds of value in society.And I believe we are now entering a further and radical evolution of how we interact and trade, because for the first time, we can lower uncertainty not just with political and economic institutions, like our banks, our corporations, our governments, but we can do it with technology alone.*\n\n*So what is the blockchain? Blockchain technology is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer-to-peer network. It's basically a public registry of who owns what and who transacts what. The transactions are secured through cryptography, and over time, that transaction history gets locked in blocks of data that are then cryptographically linked together and secured. This creates an immutable, unforgeable record of all of the transactions across this network. This record is replicated on every computer that uses the network.*\n\n*It's not an app. It's not a company. I think it's closest in description to something like Wikipedia. We can see everything on Wikipedia.It's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated. We can also track those changes over time on Wikipedia,and we can create our own wikis, because at their core, they're just a data infrastructure. On Wikipedia, it's an open platform that stores words and images and the changes to that data over time. On the blockchain, you can think of it as an open infrastructure that stores many kinds of assets. It stores the history of custodianship,ownership and location for assets like the digital currency Bitcoin,other digital assets like a title of ownership of IP. It could be a certificate, a contract, real world objects, even personal identifiable information. There are of course other technical details to the blockchain, but at its core, that's how it works. It's this public registry that stores transactions in a network and is replicated so that it's very secure and hard to tamper with.*\n\n*Which brings me to my point of how blockchains lower uncertainty and how they therefore promise to transform our economic systems in radical ways. So uncertainty is kind of a big term in economics, but I want to go through three forms of it that we face in almost all of our everyday transactions, where blockchains can play a role. We face uncertainties like not knowing who we're dealing with, not having visibility into a transaction and not having recourse if things go wrong.*\n\n*So let's take the first example, not knowing who we're dealing with.Say I want to buy a used smartphone on eBay. The first thing I'm going to do is look up who I'm buying from. Are they a power user?Do they have great reviews and ratings, or do they have no profile at all? Reviews, ratings, check marks: these are the attestations about our identities that we cobble together today and use to lower uncertainty about who we're dealing with. But the problem is they're very fragmented. Think about how many profiles you have.Blockchains allow for us to create an open, global platform on which to store any attestation about any individual from any source.This allows us to create a user-controlled portable identity. More than a profile, it means you can selectively reveal the different attributes about you that help facilitate trade or interaction, for instance that a government issued you an ID, or that you're over 21,by revealing the cryptographic proof that these details exist and are signed off on. Having this kind of portable identity around the physical world and the digital world means we can do all kinds of human trade in a totally new way.*\n\n*So I've talked about how blockchains could lower uncertainty in who we're dealing with. The second uncertainty that we often face is just not having transparency into our interactions. Say you're going to send me that smartphone by mail. I want some degree of transparency. I want to know that the product I bought is the same one that arrives in the mail and that there's some record for how it got to me. This is true not just for electronics like smartphones, but for many kinds of goods and data, things like medicine, luxury goods, any kind of data or product that we don't want tampered with.*\n\n*The problem in many companies, especially those that produce something complicated like a smartphone, is they're managing all of these different vendors across a horizontal supply chain. All of these people that go into making a product, they don't have the same database. They don't use the same infrastructure, and so it becomes really hard to see transparently a product evolve over time.*\n\n*Using the blockchain, we can create a shared reality across non-trusting entities. By this I mean all of these nodes in the network do not need to know each other or trust each other, because they each have the ability to monitor and validate the chain for themselves. Think back to Wikipedia. It's a shared database, and even though it has multiple readers and multiple writers at the same time, it has one single truth. So we can create that using blockchains. We can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly without actually creating that central authority. So all of these vendors, all sorts of companies,can interact using the same database without trusting one another.It means for consumers, we can have a lot more transparency. As a real-world object travels along, we can see its digital certificate or token move on the blockchain, adding value as it goes. This is a whole new world in terms of our visibility.*\n\n*So I've talked about how blockchains can lower our uncertainties about identity and how they change what we mean about transparency in long distances and complex trades, like in a supply chain. The last uncertainty that we often face is one of the most open-ended, and it's reneging. What if you don't send me the smartphone? Can I get my money back? Blockchains allow us to write code, binding contracts, between individuals and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out without a third party enforcer. So if we look at the smartphone example, you could think about escrow. You are financing that phone, but you don't need to release the funds until you can verify that all the conditions have been met. You got the phone.*\n\n*I think this is one of the most exciting ways that blockchains lower our uncertainties, because it means to some degree we can collapse institutions and their enforcement. It means a lot of human economic activity can get collateralized and automated, and push a lot of human intervention to the edges, the places where information moves from the real world to the blockchain.*\n\n*I think what would probably floor Douglass North about this use of technology is the fact that the very thing that makes it work, the very thing that keeps the blockchain secure and verified, is our mutual distrust. So rather than all of our uncertainties slowing us down and requiring institutions like banks, our governments, our corporations, we can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty and use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open.*\n\n*Now, I don't want you to get the impression that the blockchain is the solution to everything, even though the media has said that it's going to end world poverty, it's also going to solve the counterfeit drug problem and potentially save the rain forest. The truth is, this technology is in its infancy, and we're going to need to see a lot of experiments take place and probably fail before we truly understand all of the use cases for our economy. But there are tons of people working on this, from financial institutions to technology companies, start-ups and universities. And one of the reasons is that it's not just an economic evolution. It's also an innovation in computer science.*\n\n*Blockchains give us the technological capability of creating a record of human exchange, of exchange of currency, of all kinds of digital and physical assets, even of our own personal attributes, in a totally new way. So in some ways, they become a technological institution that has a lot of the benefits of the traditional institutions we're used to using in society, but it does this in a decentralized way. It does this by converting a lot of our uncertainties into certainties.*\n\n*So I think we need to start preparing ourselves, because we are about to face a world where distributed, autonomous institutions have quite a significant role.*\n\n*Thank you.”* \n \n\nFollow her on twitter [@BWarburg](https://twitter.com/BWarburg)", "timestamp": 1653381853, "digest": "BU7DdlSNRGuD3wLVagSHGhGDb7Nn6krJkarYDzsYXRQ",

{"id": "GJY3hFB8_QXZHbvZ38e_BuaZER6EkE9HDSqnkXNguOQ", "title": "LayerZero- An Omnichain Interoperability Protocol", "body": "For cross-chain bridging and messaging, almost every existing approach falls into one of two broad categories. The first is having a consensus forming middle chain validate and forward messages between chains. The second is running a light node on-chain. Let’s discuss.\n\n# Middle Chain\n\nMiddle chains receive, validate, and forward messages between chains. In this model, the middle chain is granted full signing power to all messages, making it a single point of failure. In the event of consensus corruption, all liquidity can immediately be stolen on all chains. With today’s middle chains bonding only hundreds of millions of dollars while securing tens of billions, as these chains become increasingly decentralized, it is not a matter of if but when this massive honeypot will be exploited.\n\n# On-Chain Light Node\n\nOn-chain light nodes receive and validate every block header for each pairwise chain on the opposing chain. Transaction proofs containing messages are forwarded and validated on chain against the block headers. This is the most secure way to transmit messages between chains. Unfortunately, it’s also the most expensive costing tens of millions of dollars per day per pairwise chain to run an on-chain light node on Ethereum.\n\n# Ultra Light Node\n\nOn-chain light nodes are extremely secure but also extremely expensive. Middle chains are inexpensive but less secure.\n\nIntroducing the **Ultra Light Node (ULN)**, the security of a light node with the cost-effectiveness of middle chains. This is achieved by performing the same validation as an on-chain light node; but instead of keeping all block headers sequentially, block headers are streamed on demand by decentralized oracles.\n\n# LayerZero\n\n[LayerZero](http://layerzero.network/) is a User Application (UA) configurable **on-chain endpoint** that runs a ULN. LayerZero relies on two parties to transfer messages between on-chain endpoints: the Oracle and the Relayer. When a UA sends a message from chain A to chain B, the message is routed through the endpoint on chain A. The endpoint then notifies the UA specified Oracle and Relayer of the message and it’s destination chain. The Oracle forwards the block header to the endpoint on chain B and the Relayer then submits the transaction proof. The proof is validated on the destination chain and the message is forwarded to the destination address.Security Properties\n\nIn breaking up responsibilities between the Oracle and Relayer, LayerZero leverages the security properties of the established oracles (Chainlink and Band) with an additional layer of security via the open relayer system. While this may seem only a small difference at first glance, its implications are quite profound. First, it means that the worst-case security of this new network still reduces to being as secure as the oracle. If you use Chainlink as your oracle any malicious action in the system is still predicated on first being able to defeat the Chainlink DON (no easy task). Even if the Oracle’s consensus is corrupted, it also requires that the Relayer is actively colluding. For example, in the most extreme case where the Oracle A’s consensus is corrupted and the Relayer A is colluding, all of this risk is only borne by those User Applications accepting messages from Oracle A ***and*** Relayer A. All User Applications using Relayer B-Z, running their own Relayer, or using Oracle B-Z remain completely unaffected. This is a massive transformation in terms of risk model from the previously described middle chain systems.\n\n# Use Cases\n\nToday cross-chain messaging is synonymous with bridging, but there is much more you can do with LayerZero than simply bridging assets. LayerZero enables cross-chain {state sharing, bridging, lending and borrowing, swaps, governance} And much more!\n\n# State Sharing\n\nSushiSwap exists on twelve different chains with each instance running in a siloed ecosystem. If they want to sync state with their main Ethereum instance, they’ll have to write code for using Wormhole, Rainbow Bridge, Polygon Network Bridge, Avalanche Bridge, etc. The end result is eleven sets of code, with eleven unique interfaces and eleven different security properties. Since the ecosystem of bridges and new L1/L2s is constantly in flux, this becomes an unmanageable proposition.\n\nWhen using LayerZero, SushiSwap would have one single interface and code base for all cross-chain pairs. They only need to implement **send** and **receive** functions**.** *Send* consists of forming a message for the destination chain and *receive* simply interprets that message.\n\n# Unified Liquidity Bridge\n\nBridges today compete to attract liquidity providers (LPs), fragmenting liquidity between bridges and their individual pairwise pools. Instead of having one pool that provides liquidity for an asset to all connected chains, LPs must choose a single pool that connects to one chain. LayerZero enables the holy grail of bridging: unified liquidity across all chains with guaranteed finality on the source chain. This means when a user transfers an asset from Chain A to Chain B, the user is guaranteed the asset on Chain B and the LP providers receive fees from all incoming transactions to Chain B regardless of the source chain.\n\n# Swaps\n\nExisting AMMs can be wrapped to perform cross-chain swaps from one asset to another without the need to modify any existing code. User’s will be able to swap from ETH on Ethereum to SOL Solana in one single transaction from the source chain.\n\n# Lending and Borrowing\n\nCurrently, if a user has money on chain A but wants to farm on Chain B the user would have to collateralize on Chain A, borrow, bridge (fee), swap (fee), farm on the destination chain, swap back (fee), bridge back (fee), repay the loan, and un-collateralize. With LayerZero you can collateralize on Chain A, borrow on the destination chain, farm, repay, and the collateral is unlocked; skipping the four bridging and swapping fees.\n\n# The Omnichain Future\n\nLayerZero will connect all chains seamlessly, having users unaware they are even using it. It will enable current and new Decentralized Applications to expand beyond the borders of EVM or Non-EVM, creating the world’s first omnichain applications.\n\n[https://app.cyberconnect.me/address/0xeB84Eb50afA10CB0B6D7Cd323Db1Fe710E586a69](https://app.cyberconnect.me/address/0xeB84Eb50afA10CB0B6D7Cd323Db1Fe710E586a69)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653382410, "digest": "VI6Zgrwlkw5C_cOEWMVOqckagKoyDLYctUBKkoOrhuI", "contributor": "0xeB84Eb50afA10CB0B6D7Cd323Db1Fe710E586a69"}

{"id": "N0N9Zz9gXoF4kZqQkHhm0svikShtg50IuKzEzpakQzo", "title": "Create A New Chain For Web3 Application?", "body": "**Web3 Meetup**\n\nI remember at the end of 2018, my companions and I organized blockchain technology workshop meetup, I invited ***Louis Liu*** to speak to the community partners about the future trend of Crypto, because he wrote a lot of in-depth articles to introduce Crypto and preach the new technology trend and business logic, I read all his articles and decided to invite him to our event,  he came to Wanxiang's conference and he prepared very detailed materials to explain what web3 is to the partners who attended the meetup, and he predicted that the application chain might explode in the future, and later he slowly enriched his theory and focused on cross-chain and application chain development, and finally established the Near-based [OctopusNetwork](https://oct.network/).\n\n**Application Chain**\n\nWhy do I bring up this story? Because our discussion about application chains at that time slowly turned into a real story, as we all know [AXIE](https://axieinfinity.com/) created its own new chain Robin, and [Defi Kingdoms](https://defikingdoms.com/) on [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) also recently announced a partnership with [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) to launch [DFKchain](https://docs.defikingdoms.com/how-defi-kingdoms-works/defi-kingdoms-blockchain) , which I understand as DFKchain equivalent to Avalanche’s sidechain or parallel chain, but in any case they have launched their own chain, and I predict that many applications will consider this option in the future.\n\n**Create your own public chain**\n\nI made a comment in the [Stepn](https://stepn.com/) community three days ago that I think they should also consider creating their own public chain that fits their product requirement. [Stepn](https://stepn.com/) is a project I really like because I'm a sports fan and have join half marathons events many times. As a participant in the Crypto space, I also expected some great Web3 apps to appear in Crypto industry. **Stepn** was on my watch list at the end of '21 when my friend  mentioned it in one talk show and I accessed their website to check out project information. I was a fans of ***Mable Jiang's podcast***, and later,  I learned the story of the two founders of Stepn on her podcast, which was very, very important for me to understand **Stepn**. Since then I've been following the project's development, becoming a loyal Stepn runner and participating in community discussions.\n\n**Uncritical thinking**\n\nWhen I tried to do an internal transfer after my run 3 days ago, the whole transfer process took 2 hours. This is not the first time this kind of problem happened, and users of Stepn community also faced this trouble long time, and I know that the reason why the chain transfer is full is caused by Solana's network problem. I also consulted with solana engineers about this problem, but there is no good solution.That's why I made a statement in the **Stepn community** that the team need to consider creating their own public chain, and the reasons for developing a new public chain are basically the same as **AXIE** and **DFK**.\n\n***Last night when I finished my activation with stepn, I suddenly remembered the discussion about application chains of meetup in 2018, and I realized that my previous statements in the stepn community were very inappropriate, and now my opinion is Web3 applications should not be urgent to create their own public chains.***\n\n**Why**\n\nThe question of whether Web3 applications should create their own public chains should be discussed in two ways：\n\n1. **Whether the existing public chains can no longer meet the requirements of the application?** Further, the team can determine whether the current public chain will not be able to meet the requirements of the application in the future as well? The usual view is that application chains are faster, lower gas cost, and low cost for users to use, which is a big reason for **AXIE** to leave ETH. Another reason is that it is highly customizable, all parameters can be adjusted, you can modify the execution environment, modify the wallet, the community own on-chain governance, or you can  reach consensus, upgrade the protocol, quickly evolve to adapt to new requirements, or troubleshoot software bugs, etc..For example, Axie Infinity, which has seen an explosion since it went live with its own custom ethereum strategy in April '21 because it reduced transaction costs by several orders of magnitude,and integrated fiat payments in the wallet, that making an explosion of whole protocol , which is the advantage of developing new public chains.\n2. **There is another important question for the team to think about, does the team have the ability to design a more perfect chain**? we know that ETH, Solana, or even certain ZK-rollup projects which  still face scalability issues, speed issues, decentralization issues, security issues now, but they can  solve these pain points  in a short time? Fork and Copy code ,modify parameters，it looks easy to develop a new chain, but running up a public chain that takes a long time and requires huge investment. So creating a new public chain you will still face the same problems in this industry, and the best way to solve the TPS  is to be highly centralized, but this also means a high risk, easy to be manipulated and other problems. Some time ago, we all know that AXIE was attacked. Although Flow and IMX are exploring this direction, it is still difficult to solve the above problems, and now all Layer 1 public chains are trying to solve these problems.\n\n**What to do?**\n\nWaiting and keep attention, keep learning, optimize the speed problem by other methods, such as cross-chain, share part of the pressure to other chains. waiting for the application chain infrastructure to mature and then deploy the product to these chains, such as Defi Kingdoms' attempt on AVAX, or wait for the maturity of Layer2 zk-rollup technology or you can try to based on multi-chain services like *OctopusNetwork*, rather than taking the risk to create new public chain.", "timestamp": 1653381664, "digest": "IYbI_4zMCkV2TclEYPsf1FHiRyK2h95RjcqBhxTt8hU", "contributor": "0xD033feF6d4C75CE2F4878314057C2F959FAB4679"}

These accounts are secured with a private key, which can be transformed into a 12 word “seed phrase” for the user. If that private key is compromised in any way, the funds can be stolen.\n\nIf your business comprises of more than 1 person, an externally owned accounts is not a secure way to manage your crypto business’s funds. If an employee goes rogue or is careless with the private key, the funds are gone forever. Even if your business is made up of just yourself, I’d argue it’s still a poor way to manage funds. So, what is the better solution?\n\nEnter the Multisig. Gnosis Safe is a smart contract wallet running on Ethereum that requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction before it can occur (M-of-N). If for example you have 3 main stakeholders in your business, you are able to set up the wallet to require approval from all 3 people before the transaction is sent. This assures that no single person could compromise the funds.\n\nOn top of that, Gnosis Safe gives you complete self custody over your funds. There is no risk of a bank giving you a hassle for running a crypto business and the smart contract that is deployed is completely trustless and in your control.\n\nHere's an overview, comparing the Gnosis Safe to other digital asset storage solutions:", "timestamp": 1653383040, "digest": "WGdV8mFJKqkdQ51dMVRbNZJghAQFkV7NiYCbKXG9ZQs", "contributor": "0xb80bd21033Cc4DcfDC9DfE5ec9E46cabd4128d8D"}

Metaverse already become a hot topic. We have seen many mainstream metaverses, such as Sandbox, Decentraland, Crypo voxel, world of web3. Can any speaker here share your opinion about how you understand the metaverse?\n\n### Vivi:\n\nI think Metaverse is really a very interesting topic. It is very close to the concept of Web 3, which in my understanding is about ownership sovereignty and freedom. We all heard about the concept from the book Snowcrash By Neal Stephenson. Everybody was talking about it. That was back in 1992, so for many years. The Metaverse seems like just another name of the evolution of the Internet. We could be more social, but actually more immersive. A16Z recently published a report that I think really makes a lot of sense. It says that broadly speaking, there are 2 competing versions of the Metaverse. One is a decentralized Metaverse with Property rights and new boundaries that interoperable open and owned by the community that builds and maintains it. That is more close to the web3 as I see it. Another Version is a centralized and closed Metaverse basically an extended version of Web 2 like elaine mentioned. Facebook changed its name to Meta. This is still like the same idea with all the platforms take most of the profit. So now which version do you support right? The open decentralized version is owners owning our own data and property right. But obviously, it’s like Shakespeare. so everybody has their own version of the Metaverse, but I think the the Metaverse combined with web 3, should give us open sources, decentralization and let us users owning our own data. We have the data ownership and sovereignty.\n\n### Jademont:\n\nI think Metaverse is a combination of multiple technologies, such as AI, Blockchain, cloud computing and big data. It attracted so much attention because everyone actually can jump in and find their own position in Metaverse no matter you are an investor, a programmer or an artist. I’m expecting not only a virtual word that people can spend their time and play, but also a new lifestyle that is in parallel with the current world where there’s no race, no country and everyone is his own Avater. One can only leave less than 100 year in real life, but can actually live forever in networks.\n\n## Q2: As we all know Metaverse is not unique to web3. Traditional web3 Internet giants such as Facebook ,Baidu are also deploying the web2 Metaverse. What’s the difference between these different Metaverse products? Which one is more promising in the future?\n\n### Andrew Fai：\n\nI have been increasingly worried about Facebook stands on Metaverse. I have a feeling that Facebook may hijack the definition. There is a lack of transparency happening with how Facebook uses users’ data. Nowadays, a lot of these hyper targeted ads are digging into your WhatsApp text messages, your Facebook Messenger, and digging into all your browsing history. I think this level of privacy is not really addressed on Facebook. This just makes me increasingly worried about how much they would know about me as I participate in their Mark Zuckerberg’s version of Metaverse. So I think there will be a competing narrative across like the Giants or Facebook, creating their own version of Metaverse.\n\n### Elijah:\n\nI think people will eventually realize the importance of their own data. Musk purchased Twitter and he says that he will be open sourcing the news feed algorithm. How user data will be collected overtime. That is a really big important moment in history, where for the first time people start understanding how much data these big web2 companies are collecting from them and they need to do something about it. And when that awareness start to arise, I think people are starting to leave. They will start to migrate from Facebooks, Instagrams or other web2 companies that are just stealing users’ data. They will embrace the new web 3 Metaverse that we’re seeing today. I believe it is mainstream.\n\n### Vivi:\n\nWe have faith that open and decentralized version of Metaverse will eventually take over. But it does take time for everything. To be honest, it’s really difficult to or it takes time to educate people, for example, to open a wallet and to really embrace that decentralized app. You know the applications that still struggling to catch up with the web 2 style kind of user experience. It takes time for infrastructure in web3 to develop and mature.\n\n## Q3: Under the background of the current bear market, how do you think the future floor price trend of these metaverse land and nft projects will develop?\n\n### Elijah:\n\nI choose to treat the MFT market as a consumer. So I’ve purchased rather than do a kind of speculative investment and I can relate to that that position. It’s essentially taking something that has no intrinsic value and creating its value through the network social capital. In the old Gallery system, this was essentially which group show you a part of which kind of creator put on your show. Which level of gallery represented you. Each gatekeeper came with a certain level of social capital and that created the value via consensus mechanism for the object in this case. The painting the photograph the sculpture, etc. And and I see the same thing unfolding with NFTS and that’s not necessarily a bad thing at all. Institutions and Instinctive organizations of society are based around.\n\n### Elaine：\n\nAs we know that nowadays there are many so many Metaverse Products. Users cannot enter into different Metaverse easily. so I think it is it possible that a future infrastructure can provide solution to build a Metaverse Bridge between different networks.\n\n### Jademont:\n\nI think Crosschain Metaverse is very necessary in the future. We can just imagine actually every Metaverse in future is just like a planet in the universe. There are isolated when the technology is not very developed, but one day they will communicate with each other by spaceship or other kind of technology. However, It’s a double edged sword. The traffic and wealth of one Metaverse will migrate from one to the other one which is more popular. I think for each Metaverse, you have to increase your own competitive power before you really make the crosschain Metaverse work. This is what we want to remind all of those founders of different networks.\n\n### CAT:\n\nOne thing I really concern is about the underlying engine. We see the Sandbox or the decentraland and or other new Metaverse. Every Metaverse was used different engine to develop. Even we use some bridge, as the underlying code so differential, people can not easily switch. So we need to develop some new infrastructure like the developer engine because there are so many underlying software.\n\n## Q4: Yugalabs provides sdk for other NFT projects, and are there any solutions which can help these 2d pfp nft projects change into 3d NFT and enter the metaverse?\n\n### CAT:\n\nSo the basically the first thing Yugalabs needs to do is to build the model. of the 2D-NfT. 2D-NFT projects need to cooperate with other brands to help them to turn 2D NFT into the 3D model and actually. We’re working on this value feature right now my project. Actually,we’re working on this feature right now. My project CAT is developing an avatar like platform. We made a 3D models for some corporative 2D projects so the NFT holders can directly use this kind of model to experience Yugalabs or something else.\n\n## Q5:Many web2 brands such as LV,NIKE ,ADIDAS are rapidly entering the web3 metaverse to build their own digital brands. What kind of services as an infrastructure can we provide for brands?\n\n### Igor Samaradziski :\n\nIt really does come to the utility. It boils down to the liquidity of viewership and popularity. So some of the really nice user cases we had recently were exposure of the designers that quite literally working from home. They map their clothes in 3D styles and create virtual fashion words, virtual fashion shows, which allow bigger brands to pick up and utilize those designs. Similarly, if you take a look at Adidas release in the early days. Who are releasing sneaker designs? How popular a certain design of NFT is depends on how many times it has been traded before the designer decide whether they want to actually produce that sneaker in life. It’s usually the product that is delivered to consumers that enjoy using it. As that liquidity builds up, we’ll see more and more brands utilizing this digital space to bridge their real real world applications.\n\n## Q6: in web3 world, DID become very popular, it’s kind of onchain social identity, what do you think about DID paradigm or new business model?\n\n### Jademont:\n\nI think it is a very promising technology for the Metaverse implementation. Instead of using a wallet address that is very long and hard to remember, people tend to use our short name like ENS, image avatar to represent their identities in Web3. This is one simple understanding for DID. A key point of DID is how people organize or even devices can be identified and located without centralized system of Identifiers. Metaverse is still evolving. It’s just the very beginning. At the first step, DID is designed for people like you and me. This is what most of the entrepreneurs that the founders are aiming for. In the future, I think DID is for everything, not only for Human being, but also devices like a machine or even cars. We have invested one project. They gives the electricity charger and DID to represent one robot. This device has a wallet , a Ethereum or pocket wallet. They can gain money from what they have done to the people. This is very interesting and I’m very excited to see what will happen. In this area, I think DID in Metaverse is a very interesting combination.\n\n### CAT：\n\nI just open my mind about the DID and another things because he mentioned that we also can just put the ID on other product or cars or something else. I believe it will be a hugedevelopment of the IOT industry because now we see the application of the web3 is just the customer application. Till now we don’t see any of the application on the factory and some other to B model so. I believe it will be a very bright future.\n\n### Jademont:\n\nIndeed, the idea is unnecessary factor for IOT plus blockchain or plus metaverse. The Technology development for the final metaverse is that there’s no difference between human being and the devices. That’s the ideal world for cyber punk. In the world you cannot tell the difference between a human being or robot because all behind is the DID.\n\n## Q7: from investors’ view, what are the new trends in Metaverse NFTs? what do you see the market go from here?\n\n### Jademont:\n\nActually we are looking for 2 kinds of projects. The first one is infrastructure, so that will make the blockchain adoption cheaper, faster and easier. For example, the NFT oriented public chains. The second kind of project. We are looking for is for products who are able to bring traffic to their applications.\n\n### Elaine:\n\nfirst trend i think is that metaverse and nft market will combine with socialfi, so this year, we have seen like like StepN，create a new model like X to earn ,it combined with a good socialfi , which turned out to be a successful Web3 product , nowadays metaverse are very single and individual, we would like to see a multi chain Bridge to link different metaverses together. So we would like to see more infrastructure to provide this kind of solution, They will bring their traffic to different and second trend i think is second time creation, nowadays we have seen some product combined with VR and AR echnique, so they can help artist to do the second time creation, so which would help the users to Show off their own NFTS, for example, if I am byc Holder. So I can use your product to do our second creation, and to share with my like social media, which is cool. And third trend I think is incubation platform like IDO platform for example, we have seen Outland JRLAND ,incubated and onboard many famous artists, such as fanglijun, their nft price perform very well ,so I would like to see more like this kind of incubation platform onboard with many a good artist.\n\n## Q8:Can you give some good advice on how to survive in the bear market?\n\n### Jademont:\n\nWell, I’m familiar with this question because I have gone three recycles since 2013. I’m an optimist. I think current situation is much better than 2018, the last bear market. At that time product teams were doing the fund raising Ethereum and then the bear market came. They cannot afford the salary of their team members. That was horrible. and wait for the next bull market. But for now, we’re doing fundraising using USDT, the stable coin. It doesn’t affect their stability of the team at least. So they have enough patience to develop their products and wait for the next bull market. So I think for developers and founders of the team members of one project, you just need to ignore all the noises in bear market and make your product get launched as soon as possible and build your community.\n\n### Andrew：\n\nI think that our first of all you need to budget yourself in terms of your available resources and exposure to risk to this market and second of all like. Need to have a very fine line between investing and gambling . These 2 are very different. Testing requires you to do very deep earth research. I will also consult experts to reach a well thought out decision entering the market, while gambling is just gathering enough data and just just. Just taking a bet, you know, so it got all you make a very big distinction between the 2 what I would say is like if you if you’re currently under the water or really suffering right now.\n\n### C.A.T:\n\nFor startup, we’re trying to do our best to go through the bear market.There are 2 things we try our best to serve. We will use the time to develop my product,add some more utility and to do some more color collaboration with it, too, just to build a great good product.", "timestamp": 1653383079, "digest": "oNC6JNSTUlgFJV7YfAlWuFpEH-Zw1fUSJqzGn_coyos", "contributor": "0x123bfD9040A61eC24feeaFf77FC22A6819320ee2"}

{"id": "v8L-Segx_jqsm43RXwg7ex2v82alvXNGJYpM9EFtLfA", "title": "UI Feedback", "body": "As a frequent user and a manager of a snapshot space from a small community, I’m very pleased to see my previous suggestions are being realized gradually by the amazing team and how snapshot keeps contributing to the success of DAO governance.\n\nFrom the times I can tell, it’s getting better and better in its **optimized creation flow**, **new** **quick access sidebars**, **notification dropdown**, **enhanced hovertips** and my favorite **personal profile** feature showing one’s voting history that I’ve never expected to launch this soon!\n\nI want to write this feedback as a follow-up of what I’ve submitted earlier this year before, from the voice of a long-term user, and also from my community members, sincerely wish these ideas will help snapshot go better in the coming future.🌟\n\n\n---\n\n### 1. Add a voting status in the proposals page\n\nThe counter in the right corner of a space shows the number of proposals that have recently entered into the active state, so I guess it’s not possible to make them disappear once a voter casts all the existing votes.\n\nHowever, is it possible to doing a workaround by adding a voter’s voting record at the bottom of **an active proposal item**, just like the “majority choice“ of a closed proposal, indicating that the user has voted this proposal. It can simply be a similar version of what’s inside the proposals votes list.\n\nIt will be of a great help since we often encounter situations where we have to load a series of proposals at consecutive intervals, and members may forget to pick each one of them or double vote on the same proposal since they can’t just remember each of their voting behavior in such situations. By enabling this improvents, people won’t need to click in to check their status, this helps much in governance efficiency.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DC62Iu5BytfCmRcjGa5P0.png?height=369&width=835)\n\n### 2. Default starting time to “Now” when duplicating a proposal\n\nIn most cases, we don’t duplicate a proposal simply because of a typo or something like that. Rather, it’s when we find a mistake in our strategy or the proposal doesn’t meet our quorum due to special reasons, we have to do so since once the proposal is posted, it becomes immutable and we can’t revoke it.\n\nMost importantly, the snapshot of the proposal is based on the creation time of itself, not the starting time we set. It doesn’t make a lot of sense that the duplicated proposal still inherits the previous one, especially a very old one with which date we will just **post a closed state** **of proposal** at the current time.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6u5JQMRNfqZutZ_lc2Uc.png?height=173&width=758)\n\n### 3. Unify the interaction dynamics on the creation process\n\nIt’s a typical thing mentioned by our authors, that sometimes they just cannot find the “Back“ button to navigate to the last page.\n\nWe found out that most likely it’s because of **the inconsistency** of the backward logic.\n\nThe current creation process is split into 2 pages: the main body of proposal, and the Choice form. While the interface has a different logic in these 2 consecutive pages, it can create kind of loss in user’s consciousness.\n\nIn my humble opinion, we should **add the “←Back“ button** to each of the creation page to bridge that inconsistency.\n\n![Inconsistency: Proposal Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0DX2Kw1zvXa3zZIu9cvTa.png?height=180&width=1253)\n\n![Inconsistency: Choice Form](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cyODQDIYrVLQE9ycTV0Xm.png?height=203&width=1228)\n\n### 4. Integrate notification bells into one within the app\n\nI noticed that Snapshot now has a full list of notification methods we can choose from: HAL, discord bot, epns, webhooks… The notification bell within the space page seems a little outdated, and our members are often confused at what these two bells represent for respectively.\n\nIt spent me a while to get to understand that they actually control different ways of notification, but this also creates a sort of fragmentation within UI. Imagining one wants to turn off notification messages from a specific space he joins in the upper right dropdown list, there’s no way to do so, and the bell below the space name won’t work either, but to switch to another notifiation type.\n\nIMHO, we can make this page much neater by **integrating** the left notication bell with the newer one, and after that it will only point to one type of notification where user can actually control to accept a specific range of space messages.\n\n![two similar bells](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0ujtOy7j3fj90TsTHabvT.png?height=426&width=1355)\n\n### 5. Highlight voting types\n\nPastachiodao is a very good example that I use it every time when I try to teach new members who are going to cast their first votes.\n\nBut sometimes when new members flood in, it’s inevitable someone doesn’t fully comprehend the meaning of the voting system or just neglect the voting type the proposal is using since it’s just placed in the upper right corner of the page.\n\nI’m thinking of a way just like what Pastachiodao did. But differently I want the ‘‘demo’’ directly embedded within a proposal in the simple form like **a short explained hint**, to remind the users which voting type they are acting on, to let them know they can actually choose one more options in an “approval voting” type. I can’t help thinking it because it would be a great attempt to further ‘‘educate’’ our users the knowledge of snapshot in a very practical way.\n\nIt can be in the choice form section **beside ‘“cast your vote“**, indicating a voting type.\n\n![a hint beside \"Cast your vote\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p6N3uMa5G1q-rVr39Sqzt.png?height=421&width=790)\n\n### 6. Make visible the bottom bar in the homepage\n\nThe bottom bar provides essential information like official contact, display mode, language setting and official tutorials.\n\nThese elements are highly useful and should be **available at anytime** at least in the homepage. (experience from other well-known projects)\n\nHowever, if one hits the “load more” button, it just keeps loading down forever until all spaces will show up, and the bottom bar containing these information just keep **“blipping“** on each loading. One has to refresh the page to get it back to the original state.\n\nTo keep the bottom bar at a certain visibility level, I can think of 3 options:\n\n1. Pin the bottom bar like “freeze panes” in an excel, so loading will not break its existence.\n2. Add a load limit, like 50 spaces/load, after that, one has to retrigger the load manually.\n3. Keep it as it was. But after one hits the “load more” button and the load starts looping, one will be able to return back the state by hitting “snapshot“ in the top bar or “⚡“ in the sidebar.\n\n![Blip on each \"load more\"...](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fTeNuFG5QZzzfxItSeGXw.png?height=219&width=1273)\n\n### 7.  Optimize the experience of edit box\n\nWe usually tweak our strategies in the UI, its original edit box. But the experience is not good, especially for a long code, every time an input will **bring the whole page to the top**, again and again, it brings us headache since we just **lost** where we were in the middle of job. I believe the issue also happens in any edit box like a plugin modal, or the playground…\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7DokWdmd9oj0EsZkKiZ7k.png?height=680&width=562)\n\n### 8. Strategy reuse\n\nFor different proposal types, we have different strategies to apply.\n\nWe know snapshot doesn’t allow the author to choose arbitrary strategies at his will. We successfully manage it at the admin level, to centralize the use of strategies.\n\nBut as such, we’re also considering for a DAO which has a pool of 10 strategies (and we use it on rotation like 3-4 strategies a time), if we can make things more efficient by keeping those **strategies temporarily not in use** in an “**inactive state”** rather than just deleting them and re-adding them back when it comes to use again?\n\nTherefore we don’t bother to write them again and can bring them back with just a click, which provides much more flexibility.\n\n![Adding a disable button besides delete?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0E6joStNfYGl_uYNbV-Zp.png?height=402&width=771)\n\n### 9. Preserve the input state of the keywords on strategies section\n\nThe number of snapshot’s strategies is exploding, which is good! However sometimes we can hardly tell the exact function of a strategy by its name and have to click in and run a test one by one.\n\nIt’s somewhat inconvenient when we click the return button, and it brings us to the whole list of strategy after we find out it’s not our strategy, we have to **input the keywords  again** to filter to the target lists.\n\nI wish the app can remember the state of our input keywords when we return to the page.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LWmGGniXeLhjlpBO-Pid6.png?height=290&width=1306)\n\nThanks for reading all the way through, hereby I give my best wishes to snapshot’s future as well as my community！❤", "timestamp": 1653383133, "digest": "XUFYktLBZvMnbNVihV84Iq0xq0hafZ_Rl8FbbO8uIKc", "contributor": "0x4F777E46C37fc4a2f70FdFB3a0A7C56C93EE82F0"}

PFP头像，这是目前传播最广泛的应用 \n2. Pass卡，高质量社区/项目会员卡、资格凭证，日前火爆的Moonbird就属于该类 \n3. 土地，对元宇宙地块进行确权，让税收和治理过程公开上链 \n4. 游戏道具，让玩家真正拥有属于自己的游戏资产，实现永久持有、交易自由 \n\n未来NFT的用例还将拓展到现实世界，让现实资产的上链，更加方便地交易和流通。可以说NFT是整个Web

代币协议\n\n\n代币协议，可以理解为NFT存在于链上所依赖的规则。不同的代币协议影响的是NFT在链上的交互方式。\n\n由于以太坊不仅仅是第一个使用智能合约的公链，也是NFT最开始诞生的土壤，所以很多公链的NFT协议都是借鉴于以太坊，NFT也带有“以太原生”的标签。\n\n### ERC\n\n\n**ERC-721：始祖协议**\n\nERC-721协议是目前NFT领域**最原始的协议**，也是运用得最多的代币协议。与普遍以ERC-20标准开发的代币合约不同，基于ERC-721标准开发的代币合约被统称为\"非同质化代币(Non-Fungible Tokens)。\n\nERC-721代币相较于ERC-20代币最大的区别就是**不可分割性**和**唯一性**——ERC-20 Token可以无限细分为10^18份，而ERC721的Token最小的单位为1。\n\n**ERC-721A：满减包邮**\n\nERC-721A是由Azuki NFT团队根据ERC-721协议优化而来的改进协议。该协议使得铸币者在铸造一个NFT和多个NFT时所产生的手续费基本相同，同时基础的铸造费用也大大降低。\n\n![Azuki铸造是的费用详情](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tXG65wjohLU5GiBeyZehR.png?height=611&width=1096)\n\n\n\n**ERC-721R：七天无理由退款**\n\nERC-721R是由Crypto Fighter团队根据ERC-721协议优化而来的改进协议。该协议提供了无需信任的退款设计，项目方将无法从锁定的智能合约中取得资金，使得**铸币者可以七天之内退还他们铸造的NFT**，获得不包含gas费在内的退款。\n\nERC-721R协议改进的地方不多，但是对NFT项目的发行环境具有重大的意义。通过七天无理由退款的机制，可以防止项目方违约(也就是跑路，Rug)，并敦促艺术家在退款期限对NFT和社区负责任；降低NFT购买过程的风险，给予铸币者反悔的机会，能够吸引更多社区成员参与铸造；保护NFT项目的地板价，当可以自由选择退款离开项目时，NFT玩家就没有理由以低于铸造价的价格在二级市场抛售，对项目造成破发影响。\n\n![Bilibili的NFT采用了ERC-721R的方式保护地板价，维护社区利益](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KWoPkmEoj4pNN2ziwqWTc.png?height=705&width=1052)\n\n\n**ERC-998：可拆解版721**\n\n基于ERC-998标准开发的代币合约被统称为\"可拆解非同质化代币(Composable Non-Fungible Tokens) , 目前该协议还未得到广泛应用。\n\n它的设计理念是可以让任何一个NFT可以携带其他的NFT或FT。转移CNFT时，就是转移CNFT所拥有的整个层级结构和所属关系。简单来说就是一个**ERC-998的Token可以包含多个ERC-721形式的Token**。\n\n该协议将对链游、元宇宙生态具有创新性的意义。以机甲游戏为例，一台机甲包含本体和挂载的武器配件，本体的属性是ERC-721，挂载的武器配件同样也是ERC-721，而机甲的完全体，就意味着两种NFT的结合。如果在传统的ERC-721机制下交易机甲NFT，持有者就得分别交易本体NFT和武器配件NFT。\n\n而ERC-988则简化了这个繁琐的过程。 当我们需要交易该机甲前，我们可以将ERC-721的本体作为父Token，ERC-721的挂载武器作为子Token**建立一个新的ERC-988代币**。这个新代币的整体是不可分割的，但也包含了机甲本体对挂载武器的所有权关系。因此我们**交易机甲时可以交易这个ERC-988代币的整体**，极大简化了NFT交易的步骤。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iIjVIJRr03gIb4mAUnoYn.png?height=713&width=1267)\n\n**ERC-809：可租用版721**\n\n基于ERC-809标准开发的代币合约，可以通过创建一个API来允许用户租用任一“可租赁”的NFT。但是该协议具有排他性，有人对该NFT进行租赁后，其他用户便无法再租赁和使用该NFT了。\n\n![链游Star Sharks的NFT可通过租赁的方式提供给其他玩家](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vAMTpAqjXqzemIhX1LfvK.png?height=684&width=1266)\n\n\n**ERC-1155：为链游而生**\n\n该协议是ERC-721和ERC-988的升级版，由Enjin团队开发，我认为是未来NFT领域最有前景的协议。\n\nERC-1155不仅仅继承了ERC-988的特性，能够使得复数个ERC-721的NFT共存于一体，还支持于普通ERC-20的代币一同打包；并且**ERC-1155还具有自动退还代币的功能**，如果接收方不支持ERC-1155协议则会自动退还，不像ERC-721协议一样，如果接收方不支持则会造成代币丢失。总而言之，ERC-1155协议在代币打包发送和防止发送过程中的丢失做出了极大的创新。\n\nERC-20协议代币和ERC-1155协议代币的发送流程对比如下：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e1-QZAvJqanUrhk0CMWMm.png?height=981&width=1268)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BtncTucMGAsOuO37G73dE.png?height=981&width=1268)\n\n我们可以用购物结账来描述ERC-1155、与ERC-20、ERC-721的不同点。\n\nERC-20和ERC-721的交易模式，就是每买一件商品都要去柜台结账，而ERC-1155相当于将商品都**放进购物车里面一次性进行支付**。ERC-1155这台购物车里不仅仅能放NFT，还能放不同的代币，这种机制能有效的减少Gas费的产生和减缓以太坊的拥堵。\n\n未来元宇宙、链游普及，所有的游戏资产上链后，涉及装备的交换、同质化产品贸易的需求会越来越多，普及使用ERC-1155协议将**免去成千上万个合约的部署**，并为有效解决链上交易拥堵的情况。\n\n### BSC\n\n\nBEP-721\n\nBSC(BNB Chain)上使用的代币协议一般是BEP开头的，同质化代币使用的是BEP-20协议，非同质化代币使用的是BEP-721协议。\n\n为何与以太坊所使用的ERC-20/ ERC-721协议如此相似?是因为BSC是以太坊增加了一些机制变化后的一条分叉，许多代币标准都是一样的，也就是说**BEP-721和ERC-721只存在命名上的区别**。\n\n### SOLANA\n\n\nSPL\n\nSOLANA上的代币**都是SPL Token格式**的 (Solana Program Library Token)，NFT对应的SLP Token只是将供应集固定等于1。Solana上的NFT通常附带部分的元数据，因此非常容易部署和传输，不需要像以太坊上的NFT需要调用合约和各种传输函数。SPL格式的NFT需要现实图片数据的时候不用进行合约调用，**Token内自带访问NFT元数据的URL**。\n\n### 数据存储\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MJFQ5UHuIjoSMWa-OpBoW.png?height=875&width=914)\n\n\n我们熟知的NFT图片数据并不是存放在链上的，而是存放在链下的存储介质。\n\n从官方文档摘取的ERC-721伪代码我们可以了解到，**ERC-721协议仅支持静态元数据**，每个代币ID必须具有由智能合约或管理的元数据URI。\n\n当我们在设备上加载NFT的图片时，我们并不是直接从链上获取数据的，而是**通过调用合约获取NFT对应的tokenURL，然后通过这个URL链接访问外部互联网获取图片数据并进行展示**。\n\n目前主流的NFT项目方都会将图片元数据上传至IPFS网络进行存储，也有部分新兴项目通过ARweave进行保存，以上两种方法都是相对去中心化的保存形式；而有些项目方会直接使用自己的服务器进行保存，NFT的URL直接指向的是中心化的服务器，有时候我们单独点击NFT图片的URL却加载不了的原因，很可能就是项目方的服务器出现问题了。\n\n通过IPFS、ARweave、中心化服务器对NFT元数据的保存各有长短，接下来将细数其中的存储机制与优劣。\n\n**1.中心化服务器**\n\n目前有部分的NFT项目直接选择中心化的服务器如阿里云、AWS存储数据,还有的项目方选择自己已有的服务器进行存储。原因就是不用产生额外的存储成本,并且数据加载的速度更快。\n\n但是问题也很明显，当项目方rug（跑路）或者服务器被攻击的时候，图片数据就会丢失，你的NFT就只是一个“永远加载不出来图片”的代币。\n\n根据Twitter KOL pencilflip在2021年10月对前22个NFT项目的一次调查，50%的项目将他们的文件存储在集中式服务器上。\n\n目前**国内的数字藏品**项目也基本上都是用fork公链的魔改联盟链发行NFT代币，用自己的服务器存NFT的图片。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KBac-0OMKICoC4X-sfKPC.png?height=703&width=960)\n\n**2.IPFS协议（Filecoin）**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Wm5jsfENJ5SjUmxbqKjSm.png?height=605&width=1078)\n\nIPFS，全称Interplanetary File system，是一个点对点分布式文件系统，是**一个类似于HTTP协议的互联网底层协议**。尽管IPFS和Filecoin都是由Protocol Labs（协议实验室）发布的，但是IPFS只是传输协议，**并不涉及区块链技术**，Filecoin只是支持IPFS协议网络去中心化稳定运行的激励层。\n\n相对于传统的点对点传输，IPFS有多个数据源对文件进行进行保存，且可以并发从多个节点下载数据，避免了访问量暴增或者DDOS攻击导致服务器宕机；通过基于内容寻址的存储模式，不仅避免了冗余内容的存储，还避免了数据篡改的发生。\n\nNFT具体的数据存储过程如下：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pPxMADA6lkNAkM8aETSo2.png?height=981&width=1268)\n\nCID是将文件通过哈希SHA2-256加密加密后生成的一串哈希值，是一个根据内容本身形成的一种IPFS系统中的地址。生成CID后，系统会将其存到一张分布式哈希表 (DHT)中，用于记录数据记录在系统中的哪几个节点，数据存储成功后将向用户返回哈希值CID。\n\n例如我们将一张图片上传后，我们获得一串哈希值：bafkreibsxcrpftxxw4i6nwrn4aigphI24m42e5jhdouq4jde3keonpqawa\n\n当我们要从IPFS系统中取回NFT图片数据时，我们可以将获得的哈希值修饰成网址然后在浏览器中打开。网址后面附带的哈希值CID将从IPFS系统中的分布哈希表(DHT)得知数据存放在哪个节点中，并建立链接返回数据。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lNRn7USAdm6OJhAhH_2_4.png?height=981&width=1268)\n\n例如我们将这串哈希值修饰成网址后，我们就可以从IPFS系统中获取这张NFT图片\n\n[https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreibsxcrpftxxw4i6nwrn4aigphI24m42e5jhdouq4jde3keonpqawa](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreibsxcrpftxxw4i6nwrn4aigphI24m42e5jhdouq4jde3keonpqawa)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yCd5O41TbxviE5RJNDiiJ.png?height=683&width=1267)\n\nIPFS还支持将静态网页存放，具体的方式如下：\n\n[https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/single-page-website](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/single-page-website)\n\nVisa存放案例\n\n[https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYVd8qstdXtTd1quwv4nJen6XprykxQRLo67Jy7WyiLMB](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYVd8qstdXtTd1quwv4nJen6XprykxQRLo67Jy7WyiLMB)\n\n\nUniswap前端存放案例\n\n[https://bafybeiagkgmmhux6fswdoedmwqqsvt5arjivl35wuk25jljb2yqgn7njgu.ipfs.dweb.link/#/swap](https://bafybeiagkgmmhux6fswdoedmwqqsvt5arjivl35wuk25jljb2yqgn7njgu.ipfs.dweb.link/#/swap)\n\n（以上网站皆为案例，切勿使用）\n\n有时候访问IPFS系统获取数据的时间要很久或者失败，是因为有一些网络节点已经丢弃你的数据了，正在根据DHT访问还有保存你的数据的节点并等待他们响应；而访问失败则是因为所有节点都已经丢失了存放的数据了。\n\n这里不得不提到IPFS系统的**垃圾回收（Garbage Collection）机制**。如果你的数据在6个月内没有被访问，那么节点就会认为他不重要并进行删除。如果想要数据长期保存，则需要通过Pinata网站等服务商对保存的数据进行Pinning，并**每年支付费用**。\n\n也就是向节点支付费用，要求他不要删除你的数据。这一点反映了IPFS系统在短期安全存储的方面是可行的，而对长期存储并不友好。\n\nIPFS仅能实现数据去中心化存储、防篡改，但不能保证数据的永久存储\n\n**3.Arweave**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q1LS-eDS4UOL5Bjes0k1K.png?height=504&width=983)\n\n永久存储，是Arweave这个区块链网络的头号标签。\n\nArweave目前提供的核心服务是**为数据提供分布式永久存储的支持**，致力于成为Web 3.0时代的数据存储基础设施。相较于Ethereum，Arweave可以归类为第0层。\n\n围绕其底层的储存服务，目前Arweave已经逐渐构建起一套基于其永在网permaweb的协议生态和SmartWeave智能合约生态，正在向WEB3全栈协议发展。\n\nArweave是如何保证永久存储的？\n\n依靠[BlockWeave](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34073/blockweave)区块的数据结构以及SPoRA共识机制\n\n**BlockWeave**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PNJuj_BetuwtmcIYHQ9Gn.png?height=981&width=1268)\n\nArweave的区块不同于普通的区块，其新生成的区块会随机指向一个已经存在的区块，该区块被成称为“Recall Block”。由于其区块链的机构在三维中很像纺锤，因此将Arweave的区块称为BlockWeave（区块纺）\n\n**SPoRA共识机制**\n\n该共识基础是实现数据永久存储的核心。SPoRA共识机制由三个维度决定矿工能否获取区块记账权：\n\n1\\.PoA (Proof of Access)\n\n为了让矿工能尽可能储存更多的区块信息，SPoRA共识机制决定了**新区块产生时随机指向的网络中已有的区块 “Recall Block” ，该矿工节点必须拥有**。因此矿工为了能抢夺记账权获得代币就会尽可能地多存储区块\n\n2\\.数据访问速度\n\n为了不让矿工为了达成“全区块存储”而使用廉价机器的行为，SPoRA机制加入了数据访问速度的衡量，让节点在存储大量数据的同时**保证数据的上传下载速度**。\n\n3\\.PoW (Proof of Work)\n\n为了避免存在有节点将所有区块存储完、数据访问速度相同的平等情况出现，SPoRA还有一个如BTC的PoW机制要求节点计算哈希值，同等水平的节点谁计算得越快谁获取区块记账权。\n\nSPoRA共识机制通过三方面的结合，保证了数据存储过程不仅安全，而且数据的副本足够多且从Arweave中访问数据的速度快。\n\nBlockweave的纺状架构自带[分片](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture))属性和高可扩展性，以及SPoRA共识机制确保了矿工接受足够的激励去存储稀有的数据，共同实现了数据的永久存储。\n\n具体的数据存储过程如下 (以Mirror.xyz文章发布为例)：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gEqSqNVU4HB8FAWoFJHzP.png?height=988&width=1191)\n\n首先我们在mirror发布一篇文章\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RCtFTN_-2vVoxNWuNG-KA.png?height=859&width=1268)\n\n通过交易哈希我们可以看到，当我们点击发布的时候mirror通过API直接将文件内容上传至Arweave上，并且通过Arweave的链接我们可以直接访问我们发布的内容。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cKQsL2a9tBhrTI0rsXkjx.png?height=634&width=914)\n\n点击Arweave返回的链接，我们可以留意到图片数据并没有保存到Arweave上，而是保存在了Mirror自己的服务器中了，也许这也是考虑到数据上传和下载的时耗。同时也可能是为了费用的节省，因为现在Mirror文章发布的存储费用是Mirror.xyz负责支付的。\n\n总体的流程为：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-P-Y-Kt5UZ22zQDTRJrKi.png?height=1079&width=1394)\n\n目前采用Arweave存储元数据的公链有Ethereum、Solana、Near，而将数据跨链到Arweave则交由**中间件Bundlr**进行处理。\n\nBundlr会严格检查上传文件的情况，若有上传文件丢失或被删除，则会破坏该区块的上传而等待下一个区块，确保了跨链数据能完全存储到Arweave上。\n\n除了跨链存储，Bundlr还有一项新技术——**Bundles**，将Arweave的可扩展性又上升了一个维度。Bundles可以将任意数量的数据，通过L2压缩成单个可以被L1处理的数据，因此Bundlr中间件的采用也让Arweave 的交易容量得以线性增加。\n\n**IPFS与Arweave的对比**\n\n* Arweave的数据存储费用为买断制，永久存储1GB的数据只需20美金，文件至少在网络内存储200年。\n\n\nIPFS (Filecoin) 的数据存储模式是按年支付存储费用的，存储1GB的数据需要0.06美金/年。\n\n* Arweave直接向网络进行付费，IPFS (Filecoin) 需要前往第三方网站Pinata为节点进行付费。\n* \n  Arweave的数据访问速度远快于IPFS网络，不存在访问已存数据节点但是数据丢失的情况。\n\n\n由于Arweave可以实现永久储存，因此许多项目方用Arweave对数据实现永久托管和验证。\n\n比如知名链下治理工具**Snapshot**就采用Arweave来储存投票治理的记录（先存到IFPS，再镜像到Arweave做永久备份）\n\n并且大部分Web 3.0项目，不仅仅本文所处的写作平台**Mirror.xyz**, 还有**Mask Network**、**MYNFT**、**Beeple**也选择了Arweave作为存储方案\n\n**Arweave的优势**\n\n![上图为Okay Bear的数据存储方式/下图为Portals的数据存储方式，均为Solana的NFT项目](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZsTA92L7TbeAY0-upvBz_.png?height=1898&width=1267)\n\n由于IPFS先入为主，并且项目与IPFS技术间的协调更加成熟，**大部份项目还是采用IPFS进行存储**，其中不乏已经与Arweave有深度合作的Solana链的项目。\n\n但是使用Arweave开展NFT项目的前景是远超IPFS的，不仅仅是其**永久存储**的特点和**访问速度**的保证，还有一个最重要的亮点：\n\n**Arweave自带的智能合约，赋予NFT原子化的可能。**\n\nArweave支持**直接在公链上铸造和交易NFT**，而并不仅仅局限于帮其他生态的NFT项目保存元数据，这一切得益于他的**SmartWeave智能合约生态**，以及在Arweave之上的**Permaweb永在网协议生态**。\n\nArweave上的NFT协议与以太坊为首的ERC-721协议大不相同，由于以太坊无法支持大量数据的热存储且成本高昂，因此协议规定NFT的元数据字段指向链下的存储地址进行保存。但是**Arwaeve可以在铸造NFT的同时将NFT的元数据保存到链上，真正使NFT成为一个完整而不可分割的一个整体**。\n\n这就是原子化NFT——Atomic NFT，解决了对NFT数据存储安全的信任问题。用户不再需要了解元数据以及各类存储方式等复杂概念，NFT的所有权与数据的所有权合为一体，使得交易过程实现了所见即所得。Atomic NFT对未来的音频甚至视频等多媒体文件NFT的创作和发展提供了良好的基础。\n\n### 对NFT的思考\n\n\n新技术的出现总会伴随着泡沫，NFT的唯一性和带来的资产确权，让NFT成为炒作的良好介质。但是**NFT不会止步于成为一张图片，而将会成为一种新的经济模式的载体**、Web 3.0这座数字金字塔的根基。\n\n在不远的将来，流媒体中的插播的广告视频可以NFT化，通过智能合约自动根据浏览量进行分润，高效、透明且公正；网络音乐可以NFT化，商业活动进行音乐NFT的使用可以自动通过智能合约向创作者支付设定好的费用，保护创作者版权；线下实体活动的门票也可以NFT化，出让、转赠、核实更加方便，同时杜绝假票。\n\n实现这一切的前提，是**NFT数据的安全存储**，NFT的任何元数据都不应该有被删除的风险。相对于中心化的存储服务，通过IPFS和ARweave存储NFT图片元数据虽然牺牲了读取效率，但获取了存储安全的保证，这对NFT的所有权是至关重要的。想象一下，当你点开一个NFT的链接，却发现它显示“无法打开”的情景，又或者是项目方可以在中心化的存储介质随意修改你的NFT元数据，那么这个NFT真正属于你吗？\n\n期待泡沫褪去后，NFT在Web 3.0浪潮中绽放异彩。\n\n###

Because our discussion about application chains at that time slowly turned into a real story, as we all know [AXIE](https://axieinfinity.com/) created its own new chain Robin, and [Defi Kingdoms](https://defikingdoms.com/) on [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) also recently announced a partnership with [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) to launch [DFKchain](https://docs.defikingdoms.com/how-defi-kingdoms-works/defi-kingdoms-blockchain) , which I understand as DFKchain equivalent to Avalanche’s sidechain or parallel chain, but in any case they have launched their own chain, and I predict that many applications will consider this option in the future.\n\n**Create your own public chain**\n\nI made a comment in the [Stepn](https://stepn.com/) community three days ago that I think they should also consider creating their own public chain that fits their product requirement. [Stepn](https://stepn.com/) is a project I really like because I'm a sports fan and have join half marathons events many times. As a participant in the Crypto space, I also expected some great Web3 apps to appear in Crypto industry. **Stepn** was on my watch list at the end of '21 when my friend  mentioned it in one talk show and I accessed their website to check out project information. I was a fans of ***Mable Jiang's podcast***, and later,  I learned the story of the two founders of Stepn on her podcast, which was very, very important for me to understand **Stepn**. Since then I've been following the project's development, becoming a loyal Stepn runner and participating in community discussions.\n\n**Uncritical thinking**\n\nWhen I tried to do an internal transfer after my run 3 days ago, the whole transfer process took 2 hours. This is not the first time this kind of problem happened, and users of Stepn community also faced this trouble long time, and I know that the reason why the chain transfer is full is caused by Solana's network problem. I also consulted with solana engineers about this problem, but there is no good solution.That's why I made a statement in the **Stepn community** that the team need to consider creating their own public chain, and the reasons for developing a new public chain are basically the same as **AXIE** and **DFK**.\n\n***Last night when I finished my activation with stepn, I suddenly remembered the discussion about application chains of meetup in 2018, and I realized that my previous statements in the stepn community were very inappropriate, and now my opinion is Web3 applications should not be urgent to create their own public chains.***\n\n**Why**\n\nThe question of whether Web3 applications should create their own public chains should be discussed in two ways：\n\n1. **Whether the existing public chains can no longer meet the requirements of the application?** Further, the team can determine whether the current public chain will not be able to meet the requirements of the application in the future as well? The usual view is that application chains are faster, lower gas cost, and low cost for users to use, which is a big reason for **AXIE** to leave ETH. Another reason is that it is highly customizable, all parameters can be adjusted, you can modify the execution environment, modify the wallet, the community own on-chain governance, or you can  reach consensus, upgrade the protocol, quickly evolve to adapt to new requirements, or troubleshoot software bugs, etc..For example, Axie Infinity, which has seen an explosion since it went live with its own custom ethereum strategy in April '21 because it reduced transaction costs by several orders of magnitude,and integrated fiat payments in the wallet, that making an explosion of whole protocol , which is the advantage of developing new public chains.\n2. **There is another important question for the team to think about, does the team have the ability to design a more perfect chain**? we know that ETH, Solana, or even certain ZK-rollup projects which  still face scalability issues, speed issues, decentralization issues, security issues now, but they can  solve these pain points  in a short time? Fork and Copy code ,modify parameters，it looks easy to develop a new chain, but running up a public chain that takes a long time and requires huge investment. So creating a new public chain you will still face the same problems in this industry, and the best way to solve the TPS  is to be highly centralized, but this also means a high risk, easy to be manipulated and other problems. Some time ago, we all know that AXIE was attacked. Although Flow and IMX are exploring this direction, it is still difficult to solve the above problems, and now all Layer 1 public chains are trying to solve these problems.\n\n**What to do?**\n\nWaiting and keep attention, keep learning, optimize the speed problem by other methods, such as cross-chain, share part of the pressure to other chains. waiting for the application chain infrastructure to mature and then deploy the product to these chains, such as Defi Kingdoms' attempt on AVAX, or wait for the maturity of Layer2 zk-rollup technology or you can try to based on multi-chain services like *OctopusNetwork*, rather than taking the risk to create new public chain.", "timestamp": 1653383791, "digest": "IYbI_4zMCkV2TclEYPsf1FHiRyK2h95RjcqBhxTt8hU", "contributor": "0xD033feF6d4C75CE2F4878314057C2F959FAB4679"}

Umee plans to break the inherent silos between blockchains by utilizing bridging solutions towards interconnecting blockchains and encouraging better capital efficiency. The eventual goals will be to enable interchain lending and borrowing, multi-chain staking and delegations, plus cross chain defi rates.Key Advantages\n\n## Interoperability\n\nThe Umee blockchain is the foundational infrastructure for a wide ecosystem of DeFi protocols. Umee utilizes Cosmos’ Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) to facilitate fast finality transfers of tokens between blockchains. Umee will also utilize various bridging solutions for interconnecting between fast finality and probabilistic finality networks, allowing for even better capital efficiency. In the future, transactions made on the Umee blockchain will be able to natively interact with other blockchains.\n\n## User Experience\n\nExisting blockchain technologies are typically overwhelming for new users. The onboarding process alone can be time consuming, and minor mistakes can be costly. DeFi users often must choose between the accessibility of liquidity, transaction costs, transaction speeds, levels of decentralization, overall network security, and more when selecting which blockchain and protocol to interact with.\n\nUmee prioritizes the user experience, and will allow new users to participate in DeFi more easily than ever before. Umee’s technology offers a flexible mix of speed and efficiency for blockchain transactions, without sacrificing decentralization or network security.\n\n[https://app.cyberconnect.me/address/0xF1D7965b2Ae8cEdC8575A673090f6ab9cfC1f30e](https://app.cyberconnect.me/address/0xF1D7965b2Ae8cEdC8575A673090f6ab9cfC1f30e)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653384143, "digest": "Q6B0zmRsh1faLLPDNcGFqPIvGeVCVroP-Pj8EEVwqVQ", "contributor": "0xF1D7965b2Ae8cEdC8575A673090f6ab9cfC1f30e"}

Abbiamo creato molti modi per farlo - dal linguaggio, alla religione, alle strutture legali, alle norme stradali - e sono tutti sistemi creati per allineare le nostre azioni.\n\nNonostante questi mezzi, molti degli attuali tentativi per coordinare azioni su larga scala stanno fallendo. La salute del pianeta è in rapido declino. I software open source non hanno abbastanza fondi. I beni pubblici e comuni non ricevono abbastanza supporto per sopravvivere nel lungo periodo. \n\nMa perchè queste cose fondamentali che dovrebbero portare beneficio a tutti quanti sono spesso lasciate in disparte e, ancora più importante, perchè dovremmo preoccuparcene? In un periodo in cui la coordinazione è messa in disparte in favore della defezione, e un punto d’incontro è difficile da trovare, come possiamo fare per scegliere una strada che ci porti a un futuro migliore? Ecco quindi Ether’s Phoenix.\n\n**IMPATTO = PROFITTO**\n\nImmaginate un mondo dove ogni individuo riceve profitto proporzionalmente al proprio impatto positivo. Ad esempio, distribuisci il tuo pacchetto software gratis, vieni pagato proporzionalmente. Possiamo chiamare questa equazione il “rapporto dell’equità“, dove impatto = profitto.\n\nMa come calcoliamo quell’impatto? I contributi positivi sono notoriamente difficili da misurare. Non solo molti beni pubblici soffrono dall’effetto del, per così dire, “lontano dagli occhi, lontano dal cuore”, ma possono richiedere un periodo di tempo prolungato per manifestare e misurare i loro effetti. Il mercato libero è il nostro strumento più popolare per constatare l’impatto di qualcosa, ma per queste ed altre ragioni non riesce a compensare adeguatamente la maggioranza dei beni pubblici e comuni.\n\nIl passare del tempo può aiutare ad alleviare questi problemi. In generale, è più facile stabilire **cos’è stato utile nel passato** rispetto a **quanto sarà utile nel futuro**. Di conseguenza, per calcolare il profitto personale di ogni attore, immaginate una società che si ferma ogni tanto e guarda indietro, cercando tra i suoi cittadini, e paga il profitto che ognuno di loro si merita. Questa è la parte [“retroattiva” dei fondi per i beni comuni.](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c)\n\nSe crediamo che questo sia un buon sistema, questo processo diventa ricorsivo: l'“impatto” che fa parte del rapporto dell’equità garantirà anche le ricompense per chi ha contribuito a creare questo mondo. Il lavoro necessario a costruire un sistema che supporti i beni pubblici è un bene pubblico già di per se stesso.\n\n**EVOCARE LA FENICE**\n\nQuesta è Ether’s Phoenix: un angelo che ti ricompensa per averlo evocato, una sorta di [Basilisco di Roko](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rokos-basilisk) al contrario. Un algoritmo che ricompensa i primi cooperatori che hanno creato le condizioni affinchè i beni pubblici potessero prosperare. Un futuro in cui investire prima nei beni pubblici viene riconosciuto. E’ anche una forma mentis: che l’ottimismo prevale, che sistemi migliori sono possibili, e che l’umanità sarà ricompensata per la sua rivoluzione cooperativa.\n\nDevolvere il 100% dei profitti del centralized sequencer all’Ethereum protocol development è il [contributo](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) attuale (ma non finale) che Optimism sta dando per evocare la fenice. Non risolverà tutti i problemi del mondo, ma è un buon passo nella giusta direzione, e chissà dove potrà portare? Possibilmente un futuro più armonioso, se osiamo immaginarlo e costruirlo.\n\nSe tutto questo suona come qualcosa che potresti essere interessato a fare, controlla la nostra [bacheca degli annunci di lavoro](https://boards.greenhouse.io/optimism).

居民杠杆率-1：住户贷款季度环比增速继续降低，为何居民去杠杆之日就是房价崩盘之时？12个主要城市挂牌量走势\n\n我国的居民杠杆已经处于崩溃的边缘。我对比过1997年香港居民的存贷比，研究了杭州居民的存贷比，分析了美国居民杠杆率，以及次贷危机前美国新屋销售与成屋销售的成交量关系，基本确定了我国商品房的未来下跌周期。\n\n\\*\\*那么所有人关注的法拍房数据与居民杠杆率及房地产泡沫有什么关系呢？\\*\\*阿里法拍已经屏蔽了挂牌量，因此这个指标已经失效，商品房被法拍中有第三方机构测算，属于无法还贷断供法拍的比例在20%以上，有三分之一规模的法拍房是债务债权纠纷造成的。\n\n因此法拍房数量只能作为观测指标，并不能具体的说明什么结果，那么二手房挂牌量呢？\n\n**随着新房房产证的逐步办理，限售二手房逐步解冻，挂牌量确实出现了上升，但是目前根据我的市场调查，底层市民并没有察觉危机正在到来，并没有出现恐慌性挂牌。**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mTVS9PBS_GsE-ygMIaA_y.png?height=660&width=1908)\n\n追踪了几个城市以后，我发现天津、太原、重庆近半年来二手房挂牌量几乎没有太大变动。与去年9月份对比，2022年4月份南京、重庆挂牌量分别微增3.05%、2.36%，**成都、西安、广州、苏州、杭州、天津二手房挂牌量在7个月内分别增加35.52%、26.35%、18.45%、17.88%、12.98%、10.79%**，其中成都、西安、广州有二手房指导价。\n\n是否是因为二手房指导价把部分投机客吓唬出来了呢？\n\n投机客是否在二手房指导价的影响下嗅到了房地产的危机呢？\n\n同样，成都、西安、杭州主城区存在倒挂楼盘，有摇号投机的商机，难道是这些人卖掉二手房去摇号买新房吗？\n\n这些我都无法知道，而显而易见的是2022年9月份以后全国二手房成交量和新房一样，出现了大规模的下跌。因此第三种可能就是二手房成交量下跌导致挂牌量无法得到有效的消耗，最终使得挂牌量看起来增加了许多。\n\n对比2021年12月份的数据，2022年4月份挂牌量增加较多的城市**主要有郑州、苏州、杭州，分别增加16.01%、14.43%、14.1%**。挂牌量越多，成交量越低，那么房价越容易下跌，这是一个铁律，随着2017年以来新房的陆续交付，房产证的陆续办理，挂牌量一定会只多不少。\n\n贝壳系员工总数45.45w，占我国房产中介总人数158w-200w的20%-30%，那么**我**可以粗略地估算出，**实际我国各城市的挂牌量即为贝壳系挂牌量的2-3倍，真实的二手房去化周期可能远比我想的要大，卖房的难度随着时间的推移在不断的加大**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hgXF6s8rH9r5JdwAf3Z0t.png?height=293&width=845)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f-XpM51-lTyWaQzY673ml.png?height=1362&width=1600)\n\n2022年一季度住户贷款增加了1.26w亿，一季度末住户贷款余额达到了72.37w亿，季度环比增速下降到了1.77%，增速较去年四季度下降了0.49%，按照这个下降速度，2023年第一季度住户贷款增速将接近为0，甚至为负数。\n\n住户贷款的扩张也是实体经济的扩张，住户贷款的扩张=新增贷款-还款金额，还款金额是固定不变的，借新还旧的前提是，年化贷款增速大于贷款利率增速。\n\n目前年化基准贷款利率为4.9%，实体经济的综合贷款利率在5.5%以上，债券市场政府债利率为3.5%，那么**按照基准利率4.9%来测算，实际每个季度的贷款增速必须在1.22%上**，一季度我国住户贷款增速大于1.22%，说明我国实体经济除去借新还旧以外，还有多余的扩张空间。\n\n低于1.22%意味着什么呢？意味着借新无法还旧，社会资金链开始断裂，即我国的季度贷款环比增速必须大于1.22%，按照每个季度下跌0.49%的速度，三季度末，我国住户贷款季度环比增速为0.79%，四季度末增速降为0.3%，合计**全年住户贷款增速为4.14%**。2022年全年我国的住户贷款增速将低于4.9%，低于gdp目标增速5.5%，gdp目标的完成将主要依靠政府加杠杆，这就说明从第三季度开始，我国的实体经济将会出现大规模的负反馈，即资金链开始断裂。\n\n有人认为降低贷款利率即可续命，但是住户贷款已经见顶，增速开始放缓，最后负增长，贷款利率能降为负数吗？\n\n下午和朋友聊天，说起来现在的经济形势，第一季度，东部排名非常靠前的市，税收下降了30%。\n\n当前，境内、外任何公司，不相信境内的供应商和客户，具备执行合同的能力。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gFsjTWFuY9TqtOIlnMjE-.png?height=322&width=1102)\n\n作者：多伦多方脸\n链接：https://www.zhihu.com/question/521630368/answer/2454733224\n来源：知乎\n著作权归作者所有。商业转载请联系作者获得授权，非商业转载请注明出处。\n\n首先先说结论，危机即将到来，但是这个危机是个类似温水煮青蛙的形式，而并不是大家想的轰轰烈烈的到来。而这个趋势是一种必然，最近经济下行，很多人归咎于疫情，但是我认为疫情只是加速了这一趋势，总体来说大趋势上，是处于不可逆的状态。\n\n首先这边就讲一个核心观点，既中等收入陷阱（英语：Middle income trap）指一个国家因某些优势达到一定收入水准，但停留在该经济水准的情况。中等收入陷阱中的国家，因薪资上涨，失去出口产品的竞争力，无法与低成本生产的他国竞争，也无法进入高附加值市场，发达经济体的行列。\n\n近些年我们的高速发展，虽然体量上达到了前所未有的状态，但是其本质以及增长率并没有跳脱出，传统发展中国家逻辑。\n\n中等收入陷阱可以按照人均gdp分为五个阶段（按照2018年的美元汇率）\n\n* 初期：世界银行中低收入国家门槛——8000美元（4000-8000美元）\n* 中前期：8000——10000美元\n* 中期：10000美元——世界银行高收入国家门槛（2018年为12600美元）\n* 中后期：世界银行高收入国家门槛——世界银行高收入门槛\\*1.25（大约为12600-15750美元）\n* 后期：世界银行高收入国家门槛\\*1.25——世界银行高收入国家门槛\\*1.5（大约为15750-18900美元）\n\n目前来看，我们还没有到达中等收入陷阱后期，还处于中等陷阱中后期阶段，短期内看，经济还将持续发展，只是发展减速，并在进入后期状态后出现衰退。\n\n本文较长，如果有兴趣可以读下去。\n\n本文主要分为三个段落\n\n1\\.对比来看中国处于什么阶段\n\n2\\.到底是什么原因产生了中等收入陷阱的问题\n\n3\\.如何迈过陷阱，以及对未来的展望\n\n吴主问汉政得失，对曰:“主暗而不知其过，臣下容身以求免罪，**入其朝不闻直言，经其野民皆菜色。臣闻燕雀处堂，子母相乐，自以为至安也，突决栋焚，而燕雀怡然不知祸之将及**，其是之谓乎!”\n\n——《资治通鉴·魏纪·魏纪九》高贵乡公下景元二年\n\n###

\n\n二手房会彻底停贷，这些都是可以预料的，大量建筑工人都要转型，国家逐步剥离房地产在gdp的比重。\n\n[房产税](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E6%88%BF%E4%BA%A7%E7%A8%8E&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A2496411056%7D)还在路上，国家意志不以你几个跳蚤跳来跳去的发反对意见就改变，历史的车轮滚滚，碾压至渣。\n\n \n \n\n无债一身轻，管住双手，减少不必要开支，再说一次，没有任何负债，不盲目增加杠杆负债，就是危机中最好的防御。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n道理好简单且明显。\n\n \n \n\n因为如果不剥离房地产比重，就会像黑洞一样虹吸打压其他行业，那么你的国际竞争力就会衰退，不赚老外的钱，那么你的收入就会不涨甚至下降，收入不涨房价就成无水之源，再空涨崩起来就没底。\n\n \n \n\n你要收入涨，就必须转型搞高科技，高科技的钱又被地产吸完，不打压地产就没法发展高科技和其他有国际竞争力的行业，地产本就是钢筋水泥的低端的行业，大家都可以搞，就没什么技术含量，国际上更没竞争力，\n\n \n \n\n如果说房地产的历史功绩，一句话概括，就是短时间内，合理合法的，把大量民间资本吸收到政府手里的一种手段。闲散资本聚集起来办大事。就是一种[强心针](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E5%BC%BA%E5%BF%83%E9%92%88&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A2496411056%7D)做法。目前从各种情况来看，其历史使命基本结束，再靠它只能成为抱着毒药来解渴。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n所以剥离地产短期看起来是阵痛，但是对于长期来说是转型关键。\n\n \n \n\n日本当年太明白这个道理，所以选择立马刺破，既保住中端，也保住了高端。\n\n \n \n\n我们现在处境更难，日本80-90年代已经是人均3W个美刀的发达国家，2022年我们才1W出头。\n\n \n \n\n而且国际形势更加恶劣，制度和意识形态不同，被各种围堵打压，高端制造被老美举起屠刀一顿砍废，中端和日本韩国欧盟一堆国家冲突竞争你死我活，低端又大有被印度，越南取代之势。\n\n \n \n\n更要命的是全球开启了去全球化，WTo岌岌可危。那么作为三驾马车唯一还能打的外贸也是肉眼可见的危机，海量工人毕业将可能不期而至…………\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n这就是一直依赖搞低端地产的后果，中间吃得油头肥肠的早就国外潇洒去了，留下些啥也不懂的小白还在拍手喊涨涨涨。\n\n \n \n\n也难怪，他们主要就是被套慌了，胡乱上杠杆，负了自己承受不了的债务，因为好像看起来这几十年来发展顺顺利利，房子也形成了惯性涨价趋势，没有经历过危机，处处以为我们立马能赶超世界第一，你当时人家都是铺平了路让你超啊？\n\n \n \n\n盲目乐观，大胆加杠杆，大胆贷款，大胆创业开店，最后一旦增速放缓，内卷加重，包括疫情，还有各种国内国外不利因素，断供法拍那是家常便饭，这还是危机才开始，就在这里喊天喊地了？\n\n \n \n\n危机发展到最后你喊都喊不出来。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n杠杆负债，被迫毕业，每天睁开眼睛就还房贷，没法了。看到别人说跌，心里那个悲。\n\n \n \n\n但是你就算把每个唱空的人恨个遍，也无法改变现在国内国际的大环境呀。 日本韩国当年自杀的多少，跳楼的多少，还不是一样过来了。\n\n \n \n\n改革和自我疗伤，哪会一帆风顺呢，必须得有炮灰呀。炮灰就是哪些盲目举债，认为房子是资产的，那是你负债买来的，叫负债好不好，你还希望大通膨来让钱不值钱，多恶心和心黑的人才这么来制造焦虑， 负债的人，在通货膨胀时，你的利息一样会涨，20%利率了解下，而且危机时刻，大量失业还会加剧你的负债风险。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n纵观二战后各国，有了稳定的五常和联合国，有了imf等现代金融组织， 主权稳定的民族和国家基本都不会发生恶性通膨或者金圆券这种事。\n\n \n \n\n所以危机来临时，减少开支，减少消费，完全不负债，两手干净，一身轻松应对危机才是最好的策略。\n\n所以危机来临时，减少开支，减少消费，完全不负债，两手干净，一身轻松应对危机才是最好的策略。\n\n所以危机来临时，减少开支，减少消费，完全不负债，两手干净，一身轻松应对危机才是最好的策略。\n\n \n \n\n三遍牢记！\n\n \n \n\n什么投资黄金，投资这样那样，还去抄底的，被那些抖音毒鸡汤一灌，在我看来这些人脑子都不太好使。\n\n \n \n\n老百姓就别太惦记抄底，资产大拿都不敢随意抄底你去抄底？特别是还有人高负债加杠杆抄底，那是直接会叫你继续穿仓，负油价了解下。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n大危机还在后面呢，几周前我就说了日元开启主动贬值，就是要打货币汇率战，跟着就会带东东亚制造业地区集体贬值。现在果不其然，中国只能被迫跟进，资产贬值大潮不久将会席卷全东亚。\n\n \n \n\n这次老美的阳谋非常明显了，就是要将你的万亿外汇储备全部打掉。\n\n \n \n\n这次将是核弹级别的危机。好自为之吧诸位。\n\n \n \n\n=================\n\n必须还要再来爽文，\n\n我以前分析国。2017年后，土地依赖超过65%的城市，基本就是很难摆脱越陷越深。\n\n毒药接着喝，停不下来的。\n\n \n \n\n为什么？因为摊子铺大了，想停都莫法，\n\n \n \n\n杠杆如漩涡，用了就难抽身，每次只有用更大的膏药去补前面的口子。\n\n \n \n\n所以这些高依赖城市，必须看起来是每次都新高， 不然立马就死，这就是土地依赖症。\n\n \n \n\n好日子在后面。\n\n \n \n\n………相信后人的智慧……后人哭晕在景山树上了\n\n==================================================\n\n \n \n\n再更……\n\n不是说了么，土地依赖高的地区，不敢降，否则立马死硬，如同恒\\~大一样，恒\\~大就是那些过度融资的地方政府的缩小版。\n\n为了借新还旧再融资，所以只能自摸，地价越摸越高，都晓得自摸会导致后面更恼火，但是还是得自摸，因为上一届留下来的继承贷，这一届你不接着贷是不行滴，否则工资都发不出来了，只能抱着毒药继续喝。\n\n滨江集团和绿城，是这次拿地大头，都是杭州的本地企业，明眼人一看就是在这里自摸，白手套啊？！\n\n \n \n\n有点能力的招保万金地产大拿都不敢随意拿地了。只有莽子还猛起往里冲，背后原因是不得而知，或者不是拍就要死，自我恶行循环。\n\n城投就不说了，政府喊多少，就是多少，自摸多高也得拿，不然工资可能都发不出来了，这能维持多久？\n\n每一届自摸多了，传给下一届，大家都相信后人的智慧……，后人一看吓傻了，莫得法，也只能继续自摸…… 相信再后来人的智慧。结果，借来的负债会越滚越大，到最后爆掉，反正不爆到各人手里头都烧高香。就是个恶性循环。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n所以现在借钱潇洒当然看起来光鲜，那是把后面几十年的钱都拿到现在用，当然潇洒，各种英明正确，各种宏大叙事，各种运筹帷幄给自己脸上贴金……其实呢，都是吃了时代的红利，而且是负债的红利而已，但是借钱是要有个度，太过了就会造成后面洪水滔天，居然还有一帮子人叫好， 傻子们还跟着羡慕，那些个借钱潇洒的主，哪个不是身边一群海吃海喝跟着红光满面的人，借来的钱不用还的么？等还钱的时候才晓得砍手断脚，树倒猢狲散。\n\n \n \n\n不过呢，[内债](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E5%86%85%E5%80%BA&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A2496411056%7D)都不是债，苦一苦韭菜就对了，大家都是这么想的……所以韭菜开始自断根了。\n\n \n \n\n内债虽然不是问题，但是现在世界不是你单一的，而是竞争力的社会，群狼环绕，大清如果不是八国一起上来捅刀子，还能坚持一百年懂不？\n\n现在的问题更严重的是外部环境恶劣，你自己一堆问题，想稳住杠杆大泡沐，别怪别人拿着刀子来帮你破了。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n所以话说回来，\n\n土地依赖算低的城市，才敢降地价，自我调控还有上下浮动空间，谁撑的久才算赢。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n====================\n\n \n \n\n如果看得爽，就再更…………\n\n \n \n\n黄教授都发言了，房地产开放商死得剩下不到十分之一才是常态，\n\n现在与各类开发商相关的，一手二手销售，设计，渠道，广告，分销。 全都要死到剩十分之一，而且中间大量地产商只会采用提桶跑路的姿态。\n\n \n \n\n这就是不破不立，没有一个行业在这种疯狂杠杆下还能全身而退。必然是整个行业的大洗牌。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n还有些傻子还以为国家这次还来兜底？没见人口断崖暴跌，各种外部环境恶劣么？去库存已经是掏空6个钱包。现在租金成本高得各类商铺都活不下去了。再涨点房价，\n\n \n \n\n租金成本升高，大量做生意的都被租金搞垮了，为什么只有中国淘宝拼多多打得死实体，别得国家都是实体网购均分，因为国内畸形的租金，大幅超越了房子本身的价值，所以一旦再度被房价拉高租金，\n\n \n \n\n恐怕就是大量商铺倒闭潮，失业潮席卷各地。连吹高房价的各类中介，我看租金都给不起。\n\n \n \n\n再涨点？，我看本来就是摇摇欲坠的的餐饮，社商底层的那些4S店，大量商铺都关门大吉了。\n\n \n \n\n我看那些盲目上杠杆的打工仔， 今天加大杠杆买房美滋滋，明天就“被毕业”法拍。\n\n \n \n\n杠杆借钱一时爽，欠债还钱火葬场。。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n还厚着脸皮要国家来利好，没见到恒\\~大，融\\~创等等诸多地产商躺地上哀嚎着，再给一次机会吧，这次一定好好卖房子，做个老实人，不再拼命上杠杆 …………一定好好学学[企业管理](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=%E4%BC%81%E4%B8%9A%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A2496411056%7D)，控制风险……\n\n \n \n\n还有这个机会么？好多套牢的投资客炒房客，都哀嚎着国家再给机会，出去后再改邪归正好好做人，还有这样的机会么？\n\n \n \n\n是个人都想跑，最后谁都跑不了，只有留着交房产税，或者断供法拍腰斩价出手。跑不掉了。\n\n \n

\n\n高房价泡沐必然要破，如同当年日本一样，这次不是主动刺破，是被人给一刀子捅破，到时候想护盘都护不住，同时14亿人口一旦开始负增长，那么不出5年，老龄化的压力陡然上升，中等收入陷阱，老龄化陷阱自然而然的就会带崩目前脆弱的金融体系。这就是既要，又要的结果。没有出清各类不良资产，灰犀牛必然咆哮而来。老美抓住就是这个机会了。目前看，基本按着这个路子在发展。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n因为各国本来就是互相博弈状态，此消彼长，你有问题不出清，在这里吹泡泡，最后别怪别人上来捅刀子，自己捅破还体面，比如30年前那个日本，等到别人来捅破，恐怕就是不是捅这么简单了，见过草原狼群围殴撕碎猎物什么场景么？有机会群狼当然一哄而上分而食之。一句话，自己问题太多，又不好好解决。光说着：“相信后人的智慧……” 后人都哭晕在景山树上了。。\n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n

"**丹青擒纵史（一）**\n\n**壹**\n\n别停，掀开裙子。\n\n裙下是赤裸纤细的双腿，一对晶莹剔透的象牙箸。向上，轻轻地，掀开裙子，荷叶似的裙边紧贴着濡霜的皮肤，像微风掠过水面。像涟漪，缓缓移动，直至腰际。摒弃负面的思考。关注此刻，诸位慕名而来的文人雅士。看着他们的眼睛，从脚趾开始，说出被裙摆抚过的每个部位，踝，胫，腓，膝，骶，髀，髋。想象一幅细数家珍的画面。应该为此感到自豪，别怕，提高音量，说出它们的形态、特征，要细致。与脸上宠物般的神态配合呼应。\n\n别低头，看着他们，用眼神告诉他们，是你想要的——\n\n***万姑娘生活在四通市，是没有编户的游民。在过去的一段时间里，她被迫在虞师娘——师娘是她对那些气质优雅而冷峻的女人的独特爱称——面前一遍又一遍地展示出自己甘受奴役或被当作动物对待的决心。***\n\n脱光，示出身体的全部，腰骨、颈肩。手心向外，手背抵住额头。俯身，尽可能的去舒腰、展背、铺胸、纳地，亲吻师娘脚下的尘土。哀求。用楚楚可怜的语气。再一遍，哀求。哀求师娘接受你的顶礼膜拜。再一遍。哀求师娘赐予你更多的惩罚、羞辱、和鞭笞。\n\n别当真，只是一场名为「佯作受辱」的闺房游戏而已。\n\n万姑娘是让这场游戏充满魔力的受辱天才，定会使每道环节都臻于完美。灼烧般的短促呼吸完美。情潮叠涌却又无能为力的迫切呻吟完美。爬动时腰部陷成的倒拱形线条，摇曳，生香，无人能及。她是虞师娘身边所有女奴的总和。她是蚀骨销魂的幻想，完美。\n\n然而，她的完美让虞师娘心生畏惧。直觉。万姑娘隐匿在一副温顺尤物的外壳当中，揭开外壳才有可能看清真相。真相或许是猫，或许是狐狸，黄鼠狼，又或许是别的什么无名无姓的山精水怪。都有可能。总之，直觉告诉虞师娘，是某种致命而又狡诈的野生物种。\n\n尽管万姑娘曾无数次的赌咒发誓，说她将永远匍匐在虞师娘的六幅湘裙之下，像侍奉神明那样，用少女的肌肤和唇舌为她的女主人暖手沐足，并将此视为一种殊荣。尽管她也曾无数次的幻想，幻想在容颜老去以前，能够像花朵那样枯萎，凋零。支离破碎。被斩断手足扔进猪圈也没关系，被碾成碎块送上餐桌也没关系——她要在生命终结之前，为虞师娘奉上一次完整、极致、彻底的献身。\n\n可她不是真正的奴隶。虞师娘意识到了问题所在：奴隶，不过是她用以表演顺从的分身术，看似卑微，实则却用一条无形的引线，牢牢操纵着别人——严格来说，形容为「猎物」要比「别人」更为准确，只是虞师娘无法放弃自己的「猎手」身份——对她的占有欲和施虐欲。直至万姑娘说出这句，想被肢解，这样的疯狂言论后，虞师娘才终于意识到了问题的所在：\n\n在更早的时候，某个被她认为无关紧要的时候，最坏的结局似乎就已经发生了。\n\n如果虞妙哉——关系破裂后，万姑娘开始直呼其名——没有低估万姑娘，如果万姑娘如她所料，明白尸体被拆解后的真实状貌，不是经想象粉饰过的，有咒语加持，仪式化的切割。不是。鲜血会溅射，但溅射不出美丽的图景。万姑娘只会在死后的七天内，化作一团剧烈膨胀的、散发着恶臭、有成千上万只蝇虫在上面蠕动的、分泌出大量黑油的腐肉——如果虞妙哉没有低估万姑娘，她就应该相信，万姑娘对肢解拥有充分的认识，却依然对此报以幻想。\n\n每清醒一分，万姑娘的轮廓就清晰一分，同时危险一分。虞妙哉意识到，眼下似乎只剩一条可行之路了：击碎幻想，她要识破万姑娘的真相。她要追根溯源，回到记忆最开始的地方，于公于私，她都必须要重新认识一次这位深谙伪装之道的游民姑娘了。\n\n**二**\n\n那天，上元灯节。\n\n虞妙哉与友人相约喜雨酒楼饮酒看灯。酉时三刻，友人未至，她索性下楼等候，久候不来。这时，一位白衣女郎倏忽闯进了她的视野之中，万姑娘，提着紫纱灯笼，独自站在道旁一株挂满灯彩的丹桂树下。五颜六色的灯光把她那富有异域气息的面孔映射得如梦似幻。无需仔细端详，只斜睨一眼，虞妙哉就知道万姑娘拥有一副讨人喜爱的丽人模样。\n\n酉时四刻，友人仍未现身。\n\n放眼洛阳城，能让虞妙哉忍受寒风苦苦等候的人屈指可数。这位朋友便是其中之一，并且是最麻烦的那个。每当虞妙哉对他的恼人行径忍无可忍时，她总会这样安慰自己：他不是我的麻烦，他是洛阳城的麻烦——发起约会的情由，本是为了帮他解决麻烦，但他本人却对此毫不在意。其实虞妙哉也不觉得为他白费力气有多可怜，毕竟职责所在，但她确实动过一个转瞬即逝的惊人念头：只有把他给骟成猪仔，锁在家里养起来，他才不会没完没了地四处闯祸。这无疑是在万姑娘的影响下才有机会出头的一则毒计。\n\n酉时四刻，万姑娘仍未离去。虞妙哉仍在原地。不是为了等谁，闯祸精来或不来都无所谓，现在她只想多看一会儿万姑娘。万姑娘似乎有点孤单，没朋友，也没处可去，于是便把树上掉下来的彩纸收集起来，撕成条状，编成一缕。她编得很认真，但实在不好说她收获了什么成果，只能根据它似有若无的雏形大致推断：像是某种彩带头饰一类的东西。\n\n酉时四刻，友人仍未现身，万姑娘仍未离去。虞妙哉将双手拢在胸前，沿着店门外的酒旗来回踱步。她的身高接近七尺五寸，姿容挺拔，目光凌厉，在喧闹的车马人流中，形如一具雌雄莫辨的古代雕塑。万姑娘很难不注意到她。在两人无言凝望的刹那，万姑娘的身躯有一瞬明显的晃动。\n\n酉时四刻。万姑娘今天很漂亮，但很反常，她平时不会这样。在她的世界里，漂亮，正常，循规蹈矩，都会被定义为反常。在她的世界里，反常才是正常。她活在一个反常到不可理喻的世界里，人们对于节日的无端热情更是反常中的反常。她别无选择，必须得做点什么超过反常的事。比如变得正常。卸掉出格的妆容，脱下惹人侧目的奇装异服，摇身变为一名朴素平常的行人。啊，好像又回到了原点——她没能把这一天想通，但为时已晚。\n\n正常状态下的万姑娘——其实是反常——看上去只有十七岁。如假包换的妙龄少女。假想状况里，虞妙哉通常会给少女提供的衣着建议是：雪光云纹襦衫，搭配深棕色火焰纹襦裙。很不巧，就是万姑娘身上的这套。像是摸清了谁的喜好一般，正中靶心。\n\n一个难以开口的私人建议是：绳子。那是一种被深藏在精神秘宇里的怪异情趣，光天化日说不得，月黑风高也说不得。\n\n绳子是一切的源头，不是丝绳，是专门用来捆东西的麻绳。万姑娘今晚的衣着打扮里，就有让虞妙哉心神不宁的麻绳点缀。她以两条粗粗的红麻绳作为臂绳，穿过腋下，绕过肩膀，会于背部交成十字，在雪光襦衫的反衬下，如同两道热气腾腾的血色鞭痕。虞妙哉就是在此细节中嗅到了万姑娘身上的同类气息，并由此联想到了野马，狩猎，和冬夜里的篝火。\n\n酉时四刻。坠落。阵阵眩晕。绳子仿佛碰到了虞妙哉身体里的某个内置机关，她的瞳孔富有层次地向内收缩。坠落。进入虚空。一些常人无法窥测的东西即将现于眼前——\n\n作为一名天赋异禀的丹青客，虞妙哉时常能看到一些超越原始形态的东西，她把这些统称为形外之形。这不是纯粹的联想，更像是一种能力，让事物在视界中发生扭曲的能力。譬如万姑娘是一个人，这毫无疑问，但在虞妙哉的眼里，她是一幅步月飞琼的小美人图。继续坠落下去，她会化作一朵含苞吐萼的春晓之花。毫不夸张，她就是一朵真实的花。花蕊中心是一簇带着乳白色杂质的红，湿润润的，明晃晃的，反射出某种绰约撩人的光泽。但当虞妙哉重新忆及那一晚的状况时，那簇带着乳白色杂质的红却异化成了一只布满血丝的可怖眼球。裹在花瓣的正中央。时而向左顾，时而向右盼。\n\n很遗憾，没能早点发现那颗眼球。眼球里淌出了一滴不明成分的汁液，有预谋地落在了她的舌尖上，而她却只把那当作是一滴甘甜的蜜酒，不假思索，咽入喉咙。\n\n酉时四刻。时间静止。虞妙哉用深不见底的目光逼视万姑娘，又极为克制。她不会告诉别人她能用这双眼睛看到非同寻常的事物，因为没人相信。如果她想证明自己，她会用眼睛直视对方的眼睛。像现在这样。届时，对方自然能够明白，「坠落」到底有什么深层意味。\n\n坠落。\n\n万姑娘是一只住在笼子里的小雀，被红绫和丝线层层包裹。丝线层层缠绕着她的四肢、项颈、躯干，像锁链，又像新衣。嵌进肉里。坠落。空气凝结成云，云化成雾，雾化成墨，墨把她们和周遭的游人分隔两界，一入晶宫，一入鲛室——\n\n酉时四刻。静止。晶宫鲛室合二为一，她们面对面站着，虞妙哉用红绸蒙住万姑娘的眼睛。她动弹不得，眼前漆黑一片，仿佛连思维也静止了。唯一能做的就是遵从虞妙哉的意志。感受。感受那些几欲失控的血流和升温。感受从疼痛上划过的冰冷抚摸。冰冷源自虞妙哉手上的指环，指环正随着细流轻轻游动——她把嘴唇轻轻放在她的嘴唇上——\n\n贴合。\n\n静止。\n\n酉时四刻。凝视，坠落，身陷幻觉，屏蔽噪音，隔断纷扰。梦境有梦境的规则，有时间静止，被放大的感官，消失的距离，月光般的吻。但这一切都将在梦醒时刻付出代价。万姑娘没有预见未来的能力，自然不能事先提防。\n\n梦境的坍塌以一条微不足道的细纹作为前兆，现于宫室顶部的横梁上，碎片剥落，落在肩头，而万姑娘仍沉溺在浓郁的亲吻当中，静止，毫无知觉。紧接着，是蜂群般的人语声，顺着裂纹丝丝渗入，渗入，直到不可收拾，在空荡的房间里形成巨大回响。脚步的回响。车轮碾压的回响，由远及近，清晰可辨。方才被梦境屏蔽的声音，此刻也穿透了万姑娘的耳膜，钻入颅腔，一鼓作气炸裂开来。梦境里的墨色宫室顷刻间蒸为水气。\n\n街上驶过一队灯车，隔住虞妙哉的视线。两人重返现世。\n\n酉时五刻，友人仍未现身。虞妙哉暗道罢了，遂整肃冠服，轻移步履，缓缓径至万姑娘身侧。此时万姑娘的心绪尚未脱离起落不定的躁动状态，一个眼错，忽见到虞妙哉近在咫尺的身影，吓得她慌忙向后躲闪。不知是灯火还是什么，她的脸，脖子，耳根，瞬间涨红一片。\n\n她的灵魂是一只金丝雀。\n\n虞妙哉比万姑娘高出整整一头，因而说话时不得不略微弯下腰来，仿佛是在同一个小女孩说话。她没有任何铺陈，单刀直入：「你叫什么名字呀。」语气轻款款，温柔有韵律，就像晓风过耳，不见半分亵渎。\n\n***这句大道至简的开场白并非由她首创。回想当初，那位麻烦朋友通过这种方式屡屡得手，她总是刻薄地形容那些被他得手的姑娘们为娼妓。现在她有点自悔失言。因为万姑娘不是娼妓。无论她在闺房游戏中是怎样的轻贱下流，也无论她们两人如今是怎样的视若仇敌，她都不会把万姑娘与娼妓相提并论。她是和娼妓有点类似的，但本质上又完全不同的，巫女。***\n\n说到巫女，虞妙哉需把记忆快速推进至戌时三刻，以此时刻作为临界点，万姑娘变得和之前有些不同。戌时三刻，两人登楼饮酒，相谈甚欢。虞妙哉得知万姑娘有个奇怪的名字，万时玲——万姑娘坚称「时」字本是牡丹的牡字去掉「土」字下的一横，然而虞妙哉认为并不存在那种文字——\n\n酒过三巡，万姑娘的瞳仁由黑转绿，黯淡的墨绿色。\n\n绿眼睛的万姑娘口无遮拦，和她初时的羞怯表现截然不同，她略带醉意，嬉笑道，这是个特殊的日子，所以她破例用了一剂透骨香。一炷香之后，她的泪水会变成香的，汗水会变成香的，口水会变成香的，甚至尿水，也会是香的。从头到脚，身上每一处能流水的地方，都是香的——\n\n听清了么。\n\n停樽。倒吸一口凉气。新的记忆开始之前，虞妙哉警醒自己：\n\n野猫不是玩物，她是暗行的猎手。\n\n**三**\n\n子时。\n\n一枚价值连城的雷文白玉琥，相传是昔日周天子的陪葬之物，同时也是它的拥有者，虞妙哉，身份显赫的证明。现在，它被紧裹在一条濡湿的红绫带子里，裹住它神采奕奕的眼睛，裹住它鳞甲似的漂亮纹理。现在，它是一根垂头丧气的短棍。\n\n虞妙哉握住短棍一头，通过掌心的热流与它发生感应。看似故弄玄虚，但它的确被注入了某种细微真实的活物气息。它的外观仍与短棍无异，却俨然有了几分老虎的神韵，一只披着红绫外衣的白玉老虎，优雅而不失暴烈地，挺入了万姑娘的幽香花丛，时而蛰伏逡巡，时而纵身扑杀。万姑娘在它的进犯下放弃抵抗，任凭它在自己的腹中嬉戏游荡。她的身体被撞击出粼粼的水纹，与体内的水流声交相呼应。\n\n与此同时，她的瞳仁也现出了令人惊异的变化，由墨绿色逐渐转变成了狂喜般的腥红色。它比墨绿色来得更为剧烈，剧烈到可以从眼睛里蔓延出来，蔓延到脸上，与皮肤底色稍加混合，便合成了一种落霞般的桔红色光晕。好看，像一种稀有染料。却极不和谐。光晕下仿佛还隐藏着一抹难以被察觉到的死寂乌青，这显然是在通宵达旦的炼丹过程中过量吸入废气而引发的某种病变——\n\n***病变是每个炼丹者都要面临的问题。除了万姑娘。她无惧乎病变，尽管她也有自己的应对策略，但其奇思妙想的程度决定了她的策略绝不适用于普通人，也不能为神仙家的玄学著作提供论据。它只能作为一则灵异传说，录入某部尚未面世的「洛阳杂谈」里，以谋诸君一笑：***\n\n***首先，她从西市王屠户处购得了一颗健壮的牛头，取出头骨内部的脑浆、眼球、和血肉等易腐物，凿去多余的骨头，使之中空；随后，留下表层的皮毛，清洗，晒干，涂油，尽力维持住牛头的原貌；再取下一片牛膀胱，封住牛头的口鼻，露出眼睛；最后，套在脑袋上——***\n\n***如果只是为了保护肺部不受侵害，那么她的办法实在是复杂得有些过头。可万姑娘有她的想法。比如，造牛头是为了防毒，防毒是为了炼丹。炼丹，为长生不老也好，为点石成金也好，本质上都是为创造一种尚不存于人间的终极之物。造物术。万姑娘发自内心的认为，世上没有什么比造物更具神性的事了。她为此所作的一切都不能仅凭表象妄下定论，包括防毒，必定也是一丝不苟的——***\n\n***牛头是献给某位丹鼎神的贡品，不在供桌上，而在脑袋上。这能说明什么呢？「说明我是牛首人身的炼丹者，我是祭坛，我是丹鼎神的牺牲。」她很满意这个答案——***\n\n没有一个炼丹者，女人，有像万姑娘这般令人欲望横生的少女面庞，傲慢，浅薄，与她的精神世界仿佛格格不入。但这并不冲突。除了炼丹，游民姑娘唯一的乐趣就是钻研女人的身体。她要得到女人的身体，得到女人的爱。为此她耗费了大量精力，给自己制造了一种名为「透骨香」的奇特药剂，沐浴时加几滴在水里，她的体液就会释放出芬芳馥郁的香气。催情的香气。所有被体液浸润过的地方都会变得极度敏锐，轻轻一碰，即可抵达冲破颅腔的登天之境。\n\n是可爱而又可恨的气味。\n\n透骨香产生的效力如同蝗虫过境，一种原地飞升式的快感疯狂地逼近着虞妙哉所能承受的极限。这让她感到恶心。快感是为了掩饰损伤，过度的快感掩饰过度的损伤。她必须要动用所有的理智才能抵御这场风暴。香气是为了掩饰毒性，过度的香气掩饰过度的毒性。她不停地告诫自己：逃离陷阱。\n\n透骨香是万姑娘设下的欢愉陷阱，诱饵是人们本能和欲望。然而，尽管大部分人渴望肉体的欢愉，但仍有一部分人，如虞妙哉，明白皮肉刺激带来的体验终究有限，总有让人疲倦的时刻，会腻。唯有心灵和幻想才是她无止境的欢愉源泉。她明白，她相信，而万姑娘理解这件事。所以，想征服虞妙哉这样的人，就要在透骨香的配方里另外引入几种药材：大麻，艾草，成分不明的自制蘑菇酒，以及万能的汞水。依照特定的用量调配，煎成浓汁，取名「十二夜水」，再将其混入透骨香的原液里。带你。\n\n寻找内在之神。\n\n云的幻象里，有个声音闪烁着幽幽的光芒。\n\n***欲望漂浮。渐逐轻盈，上升，穿透穹顶。***\n\n***穹顶之外有新的洞天，一派澄澈的景象。澄澈到可以抵消一切和抗拒有关的杂念。堆积在脑中的陈词滥调在步入新的境界以前集体死亡。抵消和香气有关的念头。天空是俯瞰万物的眼睛。万物俯瞰着天空。***\n\n***寻找内在之神。天空俯瞰着你，抵消一切探索神明的念头。你是万物初开时的模样。寂静。抵消存在感。最后一缕存在感业已消逝，草木破土而出。雾蓝色的光芒穿过眼睛和万物。万物是你。你来到一个洞穴前，既是游历者，也是洞穴本身。你是万物，你是洞穴里深不可测的隧道，内壁由光滑的淡彩色结晶构成。***\n\n***紫的。蓝的。黄的。绿的。***\n\n***抵消对颜色的知觉。你是空气，游动、徜徉。***\n\n***寂静。***\n\n***再后来发生的事，你一件也记不清了。***\n\n**四**\n\n次日一早，虞妙哉就把万姑娘赶走了，说明她对万姑娘的药剂很不放心，这让万姑娘感到挫败。有一瞬间，万姑娘是动了杀心的。无法理解。这个女人分明获得了前所未有的体验，却为什么要在事后对自己报以冷漠呢。万姑娘倔强地问：「以后还能再见吗？」虞妙哉断然答道：「坏事可一不可再，以后不必再见了。」那么，一个不爱她的虞师娘会比一个死了的虞师娘更有价值吗。\n\n当然不会。\n\n可她没有忘记自己此行的目的。她不为谈情说爱而来，有人一手安排了这次邂逅。即万姑娘自己。虞妙哉的手里有她想要的物件，在这个东西被找到之前，她不能让虞妙哉死。况且，她也没有能力这么做。\n\n别人不知道，万姑娘知道，虞妙哉的身份不仅是「著名丹青客」这么简单，丹青客是为御巫校尉身份而打造的掩护。没人知道御巫校尉是什么，万姑娘知道。那是一个隐形的衙门——灵台府——设立的隐形职位，官居七品，加迁「御巫校尉」封号，主持天文，占卜，祭祀事务，还有各类出现在民间的悬疑事件。简言之，他们是王国境内方术领域的裁决者。\n\n杀掉一名裁决者，后果很严重，所以她只好先拿一只午睡的流浪猫来撒气。她随身带着几个小药瓶，一瓶叫「今天死」，一瓶叫「明天死」，一瓶叫「马上死」。她把药瓶依次摆在面前，把小猫掳进怀里，温柔地握住它的爪子，一面比划，一面振振有词：「点小兵，点小将，点到谁就跟我走，一个爪子走到底，不是他，就是你，谁不走，谁是狗。」\n\n明天死。不行。她立即把「明天死」和「马上死」调换了位置。再点一次。好了，马上死。\n\n她把毒药涂在小猫的爪子上，小猫舔了两口，马上倒地不起了。她抱起小猫，把尸体丢在虞妙哉家的院门口里，而后心满意足地离开。等着虞妙哉前来找她的麻烦。虞妙哉一定会来的。毕竟这里有一位滥用毒药的丹鼎高手，这足以算是一桩「悬疑事件」了吧。\n\n她回到四通市，家里，其实是个地窖，地窖上面是文公子开了三年半的典当铺。家只是一种助于表述的形容，地窖就是地窖。没有女儿家常用的箱笼、梳妆，甚至连普通人常用的床铺幔帐都没备齐。她仅有一方丹灶，如触手般蜿蜒的竹制管道，和几排用于存放各类药囊、图谱、大还丹的架子。文公子反复声明，东屋是空房，可以住人，不必拘泥。但她说她有失眠症，只有闻着香料的味道才可能入睡。所以她只肯睡在地窖里，一块冷冰冰的青石板上。\n\n文公子对万姑娘好自不必说，但那是有条件的：他过去在宫里干过几年太监，五年，出来以后最大的心愿，就是能把自己的命根子给续上。恰巧万姑娘专精于此。她应了这份差，并向文公子起誓，定要帮他重振雄风。\n\n这件事最近有眉目了，万姑娘不知从哪弄来了一道神方，虽未经验证，但文公子无惧一试。唯独少了一味关键药材——黑茯苓，有极强的复原功效，同时也是世外高人们用来提升道行的奇珍异宝。这东西买是买不到的，只能拿同等的宝物换，万姑娘说，她有门路，对方要求她用一幅「水府流云图」来换。而「水府流云图」如今就藏在御巫校尉的家里。昨晚，趁着虞师娘遁入奇境不省人事的空隙，她把捕风馆翻了个底朝天，可惜一无所获。\n\n她很沮丧，但好在有新的启发。\n\n寻找水府流云图的中途，她意外发现了几封往来书信，信中大量提到了中邪、巫术、人殉一类的恐怖字眼。虞师娘和她的神仙家同僚们似乎相信，洛阳城里出现了一位、或者一伙不受控制的巫术修行者，出于未知的目的，他或他们，神不知鬼不觉地，把金谷园的穆大人咒成了一头不死不活的怪物。\n\n对，一头，怪物。\n\n穆大人，穆昆吾，只手遮天的大人物，全洛阳的名人高士都以拜在他的门下为荣。万姑娘向来认为自己有胆，但在真正的太岁头上动土，截至目前，她还未曾想过。看来这伙横空出世的方术大盗很有野心，他们肯定是要搞出大乱子的。先是穆大人，紧接着，依照人往高处走的趋势，该轮到皇亲国戚，再接下来，非得是皇帝皇后不可。她双目放光，忽然有点羡慕起这伙人来了，和他们相比，自己杀猫的罪过实在是了无新意。她为此感到阵阵隐忧，如果这群大盗将来惹出的麻烦足够大，大到让虞师娘焦头烂额，谁还会在她这样的小角色身上浪费时间呢——\n\n但她得到了启发：何不离混乱更近一些，做她最擅长的事呢，比如，趟浑水。\n\n趟浑水是门学问，想学好并不容易。如果像个无头苍蝇那样毫无分寸地猛扎进去，难保不会引火烧身。她是犯罪高手，但不疯，虽然她承认自己有疯的时候，但绝不是每时每刻都疯。涉足混乱必要了解混乱，必要掌握事件的全貌。不能全凭想象。\n\n更何况，她的想象，怪物，连她自己也说服不了。\n\n想不出头绪，于是上楼找文公子说话。文公子当然也有很多擅长的事，每个能在四通市立足的人都不简单。他的才能是探听风声——黑茯苓和御巫校尉的传闻，就是由他探听到的。文公子最大的问题在于用人，他明知道万姑娘漏洞百出的秉性，却仍不知好歹地由着她乱来，接近虞妙哉，胡闹。这是他的过失，不仅导致盗窃药材的计划全盘落空，更让万姑娘的心灵蒙受了不小的伤害。\n\n万姑娘把一只琉璃罐子揣进怀里，轻手轻脚地上楼——她必须得小心，因为文公子的命根子就在这只罐子里泡着。事实上，这个大尺寸的家伙并不是文公子身上原有的那个，原汁原味的命根子早已被穿成肉串封进一只石灰盒子里了，只有临死的时候，他才能拿出来摸几下过过瘾。罐子里的东西是万姑娘帮他寻来的。没错。那个又粗，又长，鼓着蚯蚓似的青筋，生龙活虎的漂亮东西，不是买的，不是抢的，竟是他娘的寻来的。\n\n荒唐。\n\n万姑娘用这寻来的东西，为自己挣得了一间地窖，不对，是炼丹房，并扬言要伙同文公子完成一次奇迹般的移花接木大法。文公子看到这光芒四射的宝贝，他敢说一个不字吗。别傻了。非把这女子供起来不可。\n\n每当有事相求，必要时，心灵蒙受伤害时，万姑娘总会拿出这只罐子来。摇一摇，晃一晃，抛到空中荡一荡，一直荡到文公子七窍生烟，六神无主。那时，文公子就会变成一只训练有素的蠢狗，让他做什么，他就必须得做什么。\n\n「文哥哥，我的好哥哥。」万姑娘造作地弄出一番娇媚之态，「我实在是好奇，金谷园的穆大人，他到底犯的是什么凶煞？」",

{"id": "6b6o309yZLqZGhQhzrrE0o3CgYJ4BXUgR0trQCfSjMs", "title": "Introduction to zkSync", "body": "zkSync is a scaling and privacy engine for Ethereum. Its current functionality scope includes low gas transfers of ETH and ERC20 tokens in the Ethereum network, atomic swaps & limit orders as well as native L2 NFT support. This document is a high-level description of the zkSync development ecosystem.\n\nzkSync is built on ZK Rollup architecture. ZK Rollup is an L2 scaling solution in which all funds are held by a smart contract on the mainchain, while computation and storage are performed off-chain. For every Rollup block, a state transition zero-knowledge proof (SNARK) is generated and verified by the mainchain contract. This SNARK includes the proof of the validity of every single transaction in the Rollup block. Additionally, the public data update for every block is published over the mainchain network in the cheap calldata.\n\nThis architecture provides the following guarantees:\n\n* The Rollup validator(s) can never corrupt the state or steal funds (unlike Sidechains).\n* Users can always retrieve the funds from the Rollup even if validator(s) stop cooperating because the data is available (unlike Plasma).\n* Thanks to validity proofs, neither users nor a single other trusted party needs to be online to monitor Rollup blocks in order to prevent fraud (unlike payment channels or Optimistic Rollups).\n\nIn other words, ZK Rollup strictly inherits the security guarantees of the underlying L1.\n\n## #Capabilities\n\nFirst of all, zkSync, as a scaling solution, is capable of making transfers, and doing them quick and cheap. Interfaces and principles of the core zkSync functionality are covered in the [payments section](https://docs.zksync.io/dev/payments) of this documentation.\n\nSecondly, zkSync is smart-contract friendly. Targeting 2021, it will be possible to either write contracts in Zinc, Rust-based type-safe programming language, or even reuse existing Solidity code.

This includes all of the writing platform essentials - headings, bulleted lists, images, and blockquotes. **Go ahead and write your article!** If you’re stumped and looking for inspiration, hop into the **[RabbitHole community Discord](https://discord.gg/G9XbdKfWgz)** for ideas to get your started!\n\nYou will also have access to a number of web3 tools for monetizing your work and incorporating other NFTs. These include Crowdfund, Edition, Auction, Split, and NFT Preview. We won’t be using these for our first entry, but you can learn more about them **[here](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide)**!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WjnsZIsSjd-Kxn1jlQt7M.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 5\n\nAfter you have written your article, **click the gear in the top-right corner** to bring up your article settings. Upload a **header image** (3000x1500 px) and enter a **meta title** and **entry excerpt**. Your header image will also represent your entry NFT when it is minted.\n\nOnce you're done, check your meta preview at the bottom of the article settings. This will show you how your article will appear on Mirror, search engines, and social media platforms. This is also a good time to **save your article as a draft** if you haven’t done so already. Just **click *Save Draft*** at the top.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ECl-b_LxwdcbF2lLeOQvd.png?height=1035&width=1748)\n\n### Step 6\n\nNow that you have a written article, a header image, and your meta settings all filled out, it’s time to **give everything a good double-check**. Once your article is minted as an NFT, you will not be able to make any edits or updates to it.\n\nAs with any NFT you mint, **this article will forever be associated with your wallet!** Even if you sell it, your wallet address will be shown as the original creator. So be sure to mint an original, quality article that you are happy to be associated with.\n\n### Step 7\n\nIf everything looks good to go, it’s time to publish and mint! **Click *Publish*** and **check the *Mint as NFT Edition* box**. A final menu will appear. If you haven’t added a header image yet you can do so here.\n\n**This menu will also contain the very important Funds recipient box.** This is the wallet address that funds will be sent to when your NFT sells. Copy your wallet address by clicking it and then paste it into this box.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bsm39UDQKOIjZXZfcXulN.png?height=990&width=1710)\n\n### Step 8\n\n对所有内容进行最终审核，准备就绪后，**单击*Publish And Mint Entry***。您将在区块链上将其作为 NFT 铸造，因此您需要支付汽油费。**在您的钱包中确认此交易**并支付汽油费以铸造您的参赛作品！\n\n## 恭喜！\n\n就是这样！此交易需要几分钟才能确认，但一旦确认，**您将正式将您的 Mirror 条目铸造为 NFT！**\n\nMinting on Mirror 只是我们本赛季 NFT 之旅的一部分。要深入了解 NFT 兔子洞，请跳到我们的其他指南，了解**[在 Zora 上铸造 NFT](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/6D07Jg-YlTDoPWUK9SCQ29HXV8KmtGrOC9qfYik1dws)**并**[加入 PartyBid 派对](https://rabbithole.mirror.xyz/GzrKEGWXhw-B2ui8gO9aKShrQ8aNw1rsrelr6ZyO6Hs)**！", "timestamp": 1653385947, "digest": "wN-_vsSZe2w9LSMMaTvwvDWN1IQf4unWFXsRH625vlw", "contributor": "0x0E2B29408E475567eeF4D0e729915F2a38521844"}

To dive deeper into the various sources please use the provided links.*\n\n### Description\n\n”STEPN, is a \"move-to-earn\" application on the Solana blockchain that allows users to get cryptocurrency rewards from walking or jogging”\n*Source: [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/11/stepns-move-to-earn-model-has-crypto-analysts-seeing-value-in-long-run/)*\n\n### Roadmap\n\n“The app is now in the public beta phase and by the end of 2022 is expected to release more features, such as a multi-chain wallet upgrade, and a rental and achievement system. The SocialFi element is set to be announced by the end of the year.”\n*Source: [BeInCrypto](https://beincrypto.com/learn/stepn/#h-stepn-s-roadmap)*\n\nHighly-anticipated are “…the ability to stake GMT and new game modes \\[…\\], also highly-anticipated is \\[…\\] sneaker rental. Currently, the only way to earn is to buy a NFT sneaker. Even with the depressed market sending the price of SOL to lows not seen since August 2021, it still costs a few hundred dollars for a sneaker, more than what most people would pay for an actual pair. ”\n*Source: [CoinBureau](https://www.coinbureau.com/review/stepn/)*\n\n### Team\n\n“The app is developed by Find Satoshi Lab, based in Adelaide, Australia.\n\nCo-founder, Jerry Huang, graduated \\[…\\] with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science in 2008. No blockchain experience in sight but there is mention of experience in Human Resources, Board of Directors and Game Design.\n\nThe other co-founder, Yawn Rong \\[…\\] is more involved in the \\[…\\] blockchain scene than his partner. The involvement is usually more of a business and operational capacity. He is also the Business Ambassador for Algorand.\n\nJessica Duan is the Chief Strategy Officer for the project. Her resume is also a bit thin too. A graduate of the University of Adelaide with a Master’s in Architecture back in 2010, STEPN is almost her first proper corporate job, according to her LinkedIn profile.”\n*Source: [CoinBureau](https://www.coinbureau.com/review/stepn/)*\n\n### Investors\n\n“STEPN received its first investment from some of the largest VC firms. The $5M seed funding round was backed by Sequoia Capital, Alameda Research, 6th Man Research, Morningstar Ventures, DeFi Alliance, M13, Folius Ventures, Solana Capital, Corner Ventures, Sfermion, Lemniscap, Openspace Ventures, WelinderShi Capital, Spark Digital Capital, Solar Eco Fund and Zee Prime Capital.”\n*Source: [BitDegree](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/news/stepn-move-to-earn-secures-5-million-funding)*\n\n### Tokenomics\n\n“It has two tokens\n\n1\\. GST (Green Satoshi Token)\n\n* This token has no supply limit\n* GST is the primary game token that is used almost in all possible operations in the game\n* A player can earn GST simply by moving outside, and this is the only way new GST can be issued\n* The demand directly depends on the new players\n\n2\\. GMT (Green Metaverse Token)\n\n* The total supply is limited by 6 billion tokens\n* Stake to participate in governance, the longer the locking period, the higher the voting power\n* Coin for special events”\n\nThe pie chart below shows the distribution of GMT:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9ylVoIclMbeqyDHkNwPc5.png?height=1594&width=2482)\n\nGMT is supposed to be issued and unlocked according to the chart below:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rkUdWdEK1O0doVECNWVfE.png?height=854&width=2592&&size=medium)\n\nThe in-game use cases for GMT & GST are the following:\n\n![Silver coin represents GST token and gold GMT token](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-JPABNv2gfu8w8iM4BeVd.png?height=1672&width=1378)\n\n*Source: [Medium article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/is-stepn-a-good-long-term-project-f5731b823726)*\n\n## Twitter sentiment development\n\nLooking at the Twitter sentiment from the past 7 days one can see how the commentary of people about STEPN has changed. To have a baseline comparison the chart below depicts the sentiment development on Twitter of Solana. This means for example that on the 13th of Mai 2% of all Tweets concerning STEPN were negative, 29% neutral and 70% positive.\n\nComparing the STEPN data with the Solana it becomes apparent that the neutral sentiment on both projects has increased. For STEPN around 20% and for Solana around 14% at its max. This increase in neutral commentary comes mostly at the expense of the positive one. STEPN lost almost 21% at one point and Solana 13%. The negative commentary for both projects remained relatively stable.\n\nSince Solanais the L1 that STEPN uses it does not come as a surprise that both sentiment developments are similar. We will continue monitoring this development since deviations between both developments are likely to be significant.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LRb-2askMtPIXnVdXa980.png?height=1500&width=2667&&size=medium)\n\n## Twitter word clouds\n\nThe word clouds below depict the most frequently used terms in positive or negative Tweets about STEPN. This provides context around the sentiment development of the topics that are driving conversations within the community.\n\n### Negative word cloud\n\nThe negative sentiment is driven by people saying things like “STEPN is a Ponzi and pyramid scheme, that nothing is behind it, that is unsustainable, and that it is only driven by hype\".\n\n![Negative word cloud](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ph4d6k9ZkAR4DOysqkqdP.png?height=258&width=640)\n\n### Positive word cloud\n\nThe positive sentiment is driven by people saying things like “being excited about running, celebrating their achievements, that they are taking care of their health and that they are earning through it”.\n\n![Positive word cloud](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yYfCB9TmWbZaOu-iIzPUM.png?height=259&width=638)\n\n## Telegram engagement\n\nComparing STEPN to other large x-to-earn projects with similar tokenomics can give an indication of how STEPN might develop in the future. In the analysis below STEPN is compared to Axie Infinity one of the largest play-to-earn games in crypto and to Star Atlas one of the largest games on Solana judging by community size.\n\nThe charts below are showing the weekly engagement growth of the respective Telegram groups. For example, if the growth chart is at 100% this means that the engagement in terms of the number of messages sent within the group doubled compared to the week before. The charts are also showing the respective in-game currency token.\n\nOne can clearly see how engagement growth is correlated to the token price movements. For all three projects, there is a spike in engagement growth a couple of weeks before the token price rises significantly. It is also evident how the token price declines during times when the engagement growth is small or even decreasing.\n\nEach project additionally has some stats to make them more comparable. What can be seen is that STEPN has the largest engagement in terms of total messages but also in terms of unique users.\n\n### STEPN\n\nStats:\n\n* Total message count = 483k\n* Unique users = 113k\n* 15% of messages come from 50 users\n\nFor STEPN this correlation between engagement growth and token price peaking is the weakest. However, this might also be due to the Telegram group being closed for new people to join when the price peaked.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3KHZCQWaTZLYqYxtKp_-j.png?height=1500&width=2667)\n\n### Axie Infinity\n\nStats:\n\n* Total message count = 260k\n* Unique users = 30k\n* 18% of messages come from 50 users\n\nBefore the two peaks of the token price happened the growth of the telegram engagement was significantly higher than at other times.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/p8THkinNnrUUg-XYfSYoR.png?height=1500&width=2667)\n\n### Star Atlas\n\nStats:\n\n* Total message count = 163k\n* Unique users = 21k\n* 40% of messages come from 50 users\n\nToken price performance is also similar for Star Atlas especially looking at the decline of the engagement growth and decline of token price.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GtMPTfRI388t4mNgLSt3R.png?height=1500&width=2667)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSTEPN is arguably one of the projects with the most hype in the crypto ecosystem. However, the question a lot of people are asking themselves right now is will this keep going on forever or will it crash like Axie Infinity and Star Atlas did, and if yes when will it happen.\n\nWe believe combining off-chain and on-chain data from both STEPN and similar projects enables us to recognize patterns that happened before which can be used to give early indications of what might happen to the project.\n\nThe current sentiment and growth prospects are rather bullish. We will keep monitoring and analyzing the project to see how it develops.

We just released our official conference program, and we cannot wait to see you all there. Expect a legendary NFT exhibition coupled with powerful side events. Do not miss the opportunity to join the experience; there are still tickets on sale, available at https://nftberlin.org/ticket. \n\n### Without further ado, we are thrilled to unveil our sponsors batch #4.\n\n### Tier 1: IPFS/Filecoin and Justin Sun\n\n[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) are two separate, complementary protocols created by Protocol Labs. IPFS allows peers to store, request, and transfer verifiable data with each other, while Filecoin is designed to provide a system of persistent data storage. Under Filecoin's incentive structure, clients pay to store data at specific levels of redundancy and availability, and storage providers earn payments and rewards by continuously storing data and cryptographically proving it. In short: IPFS addresses and moves content, while Filecoin is an incentive layer to persist data. \n  \n [Justin Sun](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is a founder of TRON since 2017. The TRON Foundation is dedicated to building the infrastructure for a decentralized Internet. The TRON Protocol, one of the largest blockchain-based operating systems globally, offers scalable, high-availability, and high-throughput support that serves as the foundation for all decentralized applications in the TRON ecosystem. The blockchain also uses an innovative, pluggable smart contract platform to improve compatibility, scalability, and accessibility with Ethereum smart contracts.\n\n### Tier 2: Opera \n\n[Opera](https://www.opera.com/) is a multi-platform web browser developed by its namesake company Opera. It distinguishes itself from other browsers through its user interface and other features. Opera was built by bringing together exceptional international teams, all of whom are compelled to create the best online experience on any device and build an audience of empowered, enthralled users worldwide. Opera is leveraging 25 years of blood, sweat, and product releases at the forefront of building browsers for hundreds of millions of engaged users. Opera makes experiences worldwide by developing new products, including web browsers for laptops and mobile, interactive AI-driven news platforms, shopping solutions and gaming products.\n\n### Tier 3: Lens Protocol, NFT Go and NFTPort\n\n[Lens protocol](https://lens.xyz/) is a composable and decentralized social graph. It lets creators take ownership of their content wherever they go in the digital garden of the decentralized internet. Lens Protocol is Web3 native at its core, so it's been built with features to serve the Web3 community from root to bud. With Lens Protocol, users are in control: they own their profile: where to use it, how to use it, and even how to monetize it. ** \n **\n\n[NFT Go](https://nftgo.io/) is a data aggregation platform for the Web3, NFT, and gaming communities. We make it effortless to find crucial information regarding NFTs. As the first cross-chain NFT data analysis platform, our tools provide you access to all of the information necessary to make your next move in the NFT marketplace. NFTGo aims to build a gateway to the NFT ecosystem. We will not base our core business model on data accessibility because we believe that all data on the chain comes from Web3 users, and therefore, we should keep this data open. \n\n** \n [NFTPort](https://www.nftport.xyz/) is Stripe for NFTs: a one-Stop, simple and developer-friendly NFTiInfrastructure & APIs to help developers bring their NFT applications to market in hours instead of months. We take care of the NFT infrastructure so you can focus on your application.

For example a label ‘Bitcoin holder since 2017’ or ‘Part of community/project X since 2019’ … \n\n## Where does the ‘verse’ come into play?\n\nMeritverse is a derivative from metaverse. By now the ‘merit’ part should be quit clear, what about the ‘verse’ part? How do your merits come to live? \n\nThe beauty of NFTs is that they can serve as a base layer where you can build applications on top of. As the ownership is at the users side, companies have to build upon those NFTs (note that in Web2 it is the other way around: you have to build on top of individual platforms where you can not extend to other ecosystems. You can’t import your credits, connections and diplomas from LinkedIn to Facebook).\n\nSo for example creatives could build their own, visually appealing, interactive portfolio in a Metaverse environment such as [Oncyber](https://Oncyber.io) where they can showcase the awards they won, their winning campaigns etc. \n\nA Web3 version of LinkedIn could be built where you add degrees and certificates as NFTs. Enormous Alumni networks could be leveraged as you can easily connect with people who hold the same NFT, aka degree. \n\nExperiences for specific professional NFT holders could be created. For example the online course ‘NFTs for professionals: advanced level’ can only be accessed by people who hold the ‘NFTs for professionals: beginner level’ NFT certificate. \n\nAs you can see, there are plenty of examples and the future looks bright for the Meritverse, even though those you don’t have to pay for them. \n\nA great application, and potential start of your Meritverse journey, is the POAP protocol. POAP stands for 'proof of attendance protocol'. It's sort of an NFT that proves you were at a certain event, meeting, ... or read a certain article 😉. \n\nClaim your POAP here as prove that you know what the Meritverse is all about. \n\nLink … \n\n*OG Studio is a full stack, daring Web3 studio.

Privacy is in fact a fundamental human right recognized by the UN Declaration of Human Rights, and it is important to ensure human dignity, freedom of speech, and freedom of association. Imagine for a second that all you have is available online for anyone to see:your bank transactions, your salary, your investments, property, artwork, how much did you spend at the restaurant, how much money you have (or don’t have). Does it sound right?\n\nBitcoin and subsequent cryptocurrencies are amazing tools to protect human rights: they are censorship-resistant, and they cannot be created, destroyed, or controlled by controlled in anyone’s favor. They are open to everyone and provide equality of opportunity. In the modern world, cryptocurrencies are the only tool that provides total freedom to transact. However, to achieve this, blockchains need to be decentralized and permissionless, meaning that the data is transparent to everyone and is shared across a large number of miners or nodes. Where does privacy fit here?\n\nIn a world that is moving to Web3, the value of privacy networks is of utmost importance. Ignoring smart contract privacy networks today is like ignoring SSL encryption on the internet 20 years ago. Everything we do on the internet is encrypted — emails, bank transactions, online shopping — and we probably wouldn’t do these things without encryption and data protection. Now entering the Web3 world, the next phase of the internet, we also need to ensure data privacy.\n\nIn this report, we will look at 5 privacy smart contracts networks — Secret, Oasis, Horizen, Phala, Dero– and give you a better overview of the technologies that will help the Web3 to be more private. Which one is going to be the next privacy standard we don’t know… but we do know that there are rock-solid projects with strong teams tackling the privacy issue.\n\n## **How important is privacy? Very important.**\n\nPrivacy benefits everyone. If you have a bank account, you want your balance, transactions, and salary to be kept private. If you own artworks, you may want them to keep private on the walls of your home. If you have medical records, you probably want to keep them private too. As a business, you may also want to keep some of your transactions private. The users of a privacy smart contract network are any person interested in keeping some degree of privacy.\n\nThe number of Ethereum addresses that hodl at least 0.1 ETH (approx. $300) has been hitting new alltime highs. In March 2022, close to 7 million addresses held 0.1 ETH. This is great news for blockchain adoption but not so good news for the privacy world.\n\n## **Privacy coins vs. smart contract privacy networks**\n\nBlockchains are inherently transparent. Although Bitcoin was very often associated with anonymity, the reality is that Bitcoin (and many other networks including Ethereum) are not anonymous at all. Instead, these networks are pseudonymous.\n\nEvery Ethereum wallet has an address that a priori is not associated with the real name of the owner, but if Alice sends, ETH, UST, or an NFT to Bob, Bob now knows Alice’s address and can check all her assets and all her previous transactions. There’s total transparency and total loss of privacy.\n\nLet’s assume that Bob is a good guy but one day, Mallory discovers Alice’s address that contains 3 BAYC and 500 ETH and Mallory manages easily connect Alice’s wallet to her real identity because Alice is using one of those BAYC as her Twitter profile. Then, Mallory can easily launch a hacking attack to try to steal Alice’s private keys, or even worse, execute the “$5 wrench attack”. Nowadays, people with a significant amount of crypto assets are a honey pot for hackers that try to spear-fishing or physically target them. Having a significant amount of crypto assets in your wallet is pretty much the same aswalking around with your bank account balance written on your forehead.\n\nFinally, people share a lot on social media and it’s very hard to hide your assets. For example, Snoop Dogg tweeted.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1\\*1zDp9lM-VYHKzhqZKgluTw.png)\n\nAnd after that, it’s fairly easy to find his [OpenSea portfolio](https://opensea.io/Cozomo_de_Medici), his Ethereum address, and then check on dAppRadar that he has around $15.76M of assets in a single wallet.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1380/1\\*owuf4X8vjOx82koeFfoolQ.png)\n\nWe already know that some rappers like to flash their riches but… what if they want to protect their identities or some of their assets? It never crossed our minds to be able to look at someone else’s bank account but now we can have access to all their detailed transactions and assets.\n\n## **How can we protect people’s privacy?**\n\nHave you seen all those people showing their ENS domain on their Twitter? They do it willingly for sure that that’s pretty much the same as posting online all the bank details.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/704/1\\*Yfzx3-I017FXDt2q3pG5Zg.png)\n\nPrivacy starts to be a big pain point considering that anyone can see any transaction of an address by having access to it or having access to the ENS domain - myaddress.eth. With the growing adoption of Web3.0 applications, people will want to protect their privacy.\n\nOne of the core components of blockchains is decentralization and people that have been developing dApps, know how important privacy is. However, it seems that last few years, as a side effect of decentralization and transparency, most blockchain protocols have been working against their user’s privacy.\n\nHow can we change this?\n\n## **Different cryptocurrencies have been trying to solve privacy**\n\nCurrently, the largest privacy coins by market capitalization are Zcash and Monero. These coins allow private and untraceable transactions by using technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, stealth addresses, and ring signatures. While in Zcash’s case, the user can turn off the privacy features, Monero is inherently private. Law enforcement agencies, especially the IRS, have been trying to crack Monero and even offered a $625 000 bounty to anyone that could crack the network.\n\nAlthough these blockchains do a great job protecting privacy, they don’t have any scripting functionality. Just like Bitcoin, they don’t allow the creation of complex smart contracts. Other Ethereum apps like Tornado Cash can obfuscate the transaction flow, but it’s far from keeping assets private. There comes the privacy smart contract networks. They allow the developers to build smart contracts and applications that go hand in hand with data privacy.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*MrDoUaPm9CKbhQ-oMYGlpg.png)\n\nIn this report, we will discuss only the smart contract networks. It’s also important to note that in most cases, private smart contract network native cryptocurrencies — for example SCRT in the Secret network, ROSE on Oasis, and ZEN on Horizen — are not privacy coins. Instead, only other assets that are created within these networks are private by using technologies such as private side chains, TEEs (Trusted Secure Environments), ZK-SNARKS, or homomorphic encryption. Later we will take a look at some examples.\n\nThese privacy technologies may be more common than you think. We all use TEEs every day for enhanced privacy. For example, when you use your [biometrics](https://source.android.com/security/biometric) (fingerprint) to unlock an app on your phone, the app doesn’t have access to the fingerprint but has the info from the TEE saying “this fingerprint is alright!”. The fingerprint details never get out of the TEE in your phone’s CPU.\n\n## **The crypto world is switching towards privacy**\n\nPrivacy-enabled coins and smart contract platforms have been outperforming the market, especially since countries and financial institutions have been imposing sanctions on Russia. Coincidence?\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*H8VBp3qcqUQYvMGsXpRrRA.png)\n\nThe chart illustrates well how much these networks have been outperforming our benchmark, in this case, Bitcoin.\n\nSeeking more privacy is not the only driver for the market to adopt these networks. The number of developers, wallets, and TVL in these networks has been showing that the world is switching to the privacy networks, just the same way we have switched from ancient cave graffiti to writing who owns what in papyrus that the village headman would store.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*d0lKQuWg1AD469gw-HRZ2w.png)\n\n## **Different ways to achieve the same result**\n\nOn permissioned enterprise blockchains, the answer to the privacy question is relatively simple. Technologies such as Corda, Hyperledger Fabric, or Quorum’s integration with Hyperledger Besu, allow data to be shared on a need-to-know basis or the creation of encrypted channels. Most times, most data is shared only with the nodes involved in that specific transaction.\n\nOn the other hand, public blockchains are permissionless by nature, meaning that anyone can join as a node/miner/validator. How can we keep a network fully open, decentralized, and permissionless but at the same time, keep the data private?\n\nThe different blockchain networks analyzed in this report use different encryption-enabled privacy mechanisms to provide the users with additional layers of privacy. The goal is the same: how to keep data and smart contract execution private while keeping the network permissionless and decentralized. How to allow a number of nodes/validators/miners to verify all the transactions while at the same time, hiding all the data from everyone, including those same nodes?\n\nThe networks that we have analyzed use very sophisticated ways of solving this problem. These solutions have design trade-offs and they may fit different use cases. It’s hard to say if there’s a winner among all these. I would say that all of them are big winners for being at the forefront of data privacy protection. They all use best-in-class security features. However, they also add complexity when compared to other blockchain networks that don’t need to worry about privacy.\n\nWhen trying to choose a privacy network solution, developers need to take into account the network complexity, cost, technology readiness, scalability/latency, the level of decentralization, the risk of having to include irrelevant data in the payload, exactly what data is supposed to be kept private, and how these networks manage the access to data and private keys. These networks may require further engineering for maturity and prove that they can manage networks with a large dApp ecosystem.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*7CxJF9efRyiQbfMrqSWZpA.png)\n\n*Note: In the next section of the report we will be analyzing the Secret Network, Oasis, Horizen Phala and Dero. Although we have tried to keep our approach consistent, some onchain analytics tools are not available to take a deeper look at all these networks, thus some of them may have a shorter analysis from our side.*\n\n## **Secret Network**\n\n## **Overview**\n\nAccording to Secret’s website, “Secret Network packages the smart contract execution of Ethereum, the transactional privacy of Monero, and interoperability offered by Cosmos SDK chains.” Secret started as Enigma in 2015 at MIT as an Ethereum L2, allowing privacy-preserving smart contracts.\n\nOn May 2020, Enigma rebranded to Secret Network, shortly after it launched the main net. Enigma (the company) still works on developing Secret, but more software vendors are involved in it. Secret is a DPoS protocol using the Cosmos SDK. It aims to be a base-layer blockchain network with high throughput (maximum tps not tested, but theoretically, it can be up to 1000’s/sec) and additional privacy features.\n\nSecret allows transactions and assets to be private, but users can share the viewing key if necessary. Secret uses the concept of “viewing key”. Smart contracts and transactions can either be private or visible by others if access to the “viewing key” is provided by the wallet owner.\n\nThe Secret team developed the network in order to make it easy for developers to use almost the same smart contracts from other networks. Smart contract portability is simple and easy for developers to cross deploy smart contracts in minutes, especially for smart contracts written in Rust, which in fact represents already a big portion of all the smart contracts in the crypto market.\n\nThe Secret Network is not EVM compatible yet, although it is possible to bridge tokens from a number of blockchains, including Ethereum ERC20 tokens, BSC, Terra, Monero, and Plasm. This is possible thanks to the SNIP20 standard on Secret, which is similar to ERC20. Secret also has the SNIP721 to mint NFTs with private metadata on the Secret Network.\n\n## **Investment opportunities?**\n\nSecret’s market cap as of April 6th is $993M, ranking it #90 by market cap. We can say that it has crossed the chasm, and some innovators/early adopters are using it. While it’s still very far from reaching a community like Ethereum, it can grow to a similar size as protocols like EOS and Tezos. To put it into perspective, EOS and Tezos market caps are $2.7B and $3.1B respectively. This would represent a 3x growth. Avalanche and Solana have respectively $24B and $40B market cap (25x and 41x Secret’s size).\n\nSecret’s SCRT tokens seem to be a more conservative approach from the investment perspective. In the end, this is the infrastructure layer. However, new projects including DeFi, NFT platforms, and DAOs can also represent opportunities as the Secret ecosystem is poised to grow.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*frZTDPJVl-lUL9TSQhJQnQ.png)\n\nThe market cap/TVL ratio is at 20, which is substantially high compared to other platforms. The high market cap/TVL may be due to the fact that people are optimistic regarding Secret’s growth and are pricing in the future growth. It may also mean that Secret is overpriced. However, to have a market cap/TVL lower than 1 at the current price, the TVL would have to grow to approx. $870M (from the current $47M), which compared to other platforms, is not far-fetched.\n\nThe fact Secret’s market cap/TVL ratio and TVL may also indicate the high potential for DeFi protocols on Secret — for example, SecretSwap (SEFI) and SiennaSwap (SIENNA) — that are still relatively small when compared to many other DeFi protocols and have a lot of room to grow. On DefiLlama, SecretSwap is ranked #320 per TVL, while Sienna TVL is around $10M.\n\nWho are the users? Privacy benefits everyone. If you have a regular bank account, you want your balance, transactions, and salary to be kept private. If you own artworks, you may want them to keep private. If you have medical records, you probably want to keep them private. As a business, you may also want to keep some of your transactions private. The users are any person interested in keeping some degree of privacy.\n\nAlthough there are other privacy coins such as ZCash and Monero, they fall short on handling smart contracts or DeFi applications. Other Ethereum apps like Tornado Cash can obfuscate the transaction flow, but it’s far from keeping assets private. Secret is the leading network solving this issue. Secret allows privacy-preserving smart contracts, extending privacy at the application layer.\n\nOn Secret, transactions are private, but a user can give access to the viewing key in order for another person to check/view the transactions. Only the user that has the viewing key (decrypting key) and the SGX enclave (inside a specific intel processor) have access to the data. No one, no 3rd parties can see the data, not even the people that run the validator nodes.\n\n## **Social media and community**\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/SecretNetwork) — 171,000 followers\n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/scrtnetwork/) — 3,430 followers\n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZPqj7h7mzjwuSfw_UWxQPw) — 2,450 followers\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/SCRTcommunity) — 18,400 followers\n\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/SJK32GY) — 34,000 followers\n\n## **Secret’s milestones for 2022**\n\nSecret Network goals for 2022 according to Tor Bair and Guy (the founders):\n\n• 100 projects building on the network\n\n• 5–10 applications with +10 000 active users\n\n• Onboard artists to Stashh NFT community including [Quentin Tarantino’s NFTs](https://decrypt.co/89766/quentin-tarantino-pulp-fiction-nfts-auctioned-despite-lawsuit)\n\n• More Metaverse use cases\n\n• Launching a privacy stablecoin\n\n• Launching a decentralized email service\n\nAccording to an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOR_tY5yI3Q) with the Secret founder Tor Bair, team doesn’t envision at the moment integrating other VMs as Cosmos/Secret by itself allows for high composability by leveraging Cosmos and the IBC ecosystem.\n\n## **Secret bridging**\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*aqim-GFIsmMb3FdjndvjwA.png)\n\nThe Secret Bridge TVL bridges assets from other networks to the Secret Network. These assets are locked in smart contracts on the native blockchain and minted on Secret. The TLV comes mainly from the Ethereum bridge. It reached an all-time high in May 2021 with $130M TLV. The value of bridged assets dropped sharply to $25M. At the time of writing this report, the TVL sits at $48M. Not much, but it’s honest work!\n\nThe weight of BSC is growing in terms of TVL and now represents 17%. Ethereum still dominates, contributing to 71% of the bridged TVL.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*QdTmu5v-EAdLeD5SVdsE8Q.png)\n\n## **Use cases and ecosystem**\n\nImportant to say that SCRT is not a privacy coin. However, Secret allows the creation of Secret tokens, for example, sSCRT, sETH, sUSDT, sWBTC and so on.\n\nSecret allows the creation of secret smart contracts. Transactions done with secret contracts are hidden from everyone, including validator nodes on the network.\n\nMost blockchains work with a key pair (the typical PKI — public key infrastructure that is used in asymmetric encryption and that typically people refer to as public key and private key). Secret has a third key on their toolkit: the viewing key that users can use to prove/show ownership of any assets in the Secret network. This is also good from the regulatory compliance perspective. If authorities require access to the data, the user can provide the viewing key.\n\nBy now, you can start imagining the potential benefits of having private fungible assets. Users can bridge, for example, their ETH, USDT, or SHIB to Secret, which will become sETH, sUSDT, or sSHIB, i.e. the Secret version of the token and thus creating a privacy layer for their tokens.\n\nNon-fungible assets can also be made secret. The NFT industry can also benefit from Secret features, allowing the NFT owner to choose to make the NFT public or private. If I buy a Basquiat painting, I may want to be an anon buyer. In the same way, buying an NFT on the Secret network would allow users to be full anons unless they decide to reveal the ownership of the NFT.\n\nOther use cases include whenever privacy is important for the users and regulated industries:\n\n• Healthcare\n\n• Data sharing\n\n• DeFi\n\n• Gaming\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ZuYL5qD9vXp68OIeangAOQ.png)\n\nDuring Q1 2022 (i.e. until 14th March) the number of Secret addresses more than doubled. In fact, although the network was launched in March 2020, around 65% of all addresses were created over the first 3 months of 2022, which reveals a big adoption acceleration.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*KRUwutP0X1lPkJ9FdKl_Eg.png)\n\nThe number of unique addresses and daily transactions has increased substantially since 2021, which may create a snowball effect. At the same time, SCRT token price has been diverging from the network activity, which may be seen as a bullish sign.\n\n## **The technology**\n\nSecret uses the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint consensus, which is also part of the Cosmos stack. Tendermint is a DPoS consensus mechanism, and the block time is 6.5 seconds. In theory, it can process up to 14 000 tps. However, the Intel SGX processor used by the validator nodes is a bit more limited in terms of speed. The Secret team is implementing multi-threading to increase the throughput. Optimizations can be done, but the team seems to be confident regarding the network’s scalability. On the other hand, the network scalability is also limited by the Secret Network block size, which at the moment is 10M gas but can be changed.\n\nCurrently, the maximum number of validators is 70 using Teadermint’s DPoS. The validators also need to stake a number of coins. If they fail to maintain a consistent and honest node, they will be slashed, and coins will be deducted from their account. Nodes can also be banned for double signing. Validators are also slashed for downtime. Network upgrades and security patches are easy to implement because of the small number of validators.\n\nAccording to the CEO — Guy — Secret plans to grow the number of nodes over time, which is good from the decentralization perspective.\n\nAnyone can be a validator (as long as you are voted for it), but most validators are running more serious infrastructure (servers, cloud infrastructure, etc.). Normal users don’t need to run any nodes. There’s no concept of full nodes or light clients.\n\nWhat do validators do? Well, they keep the network’s consensus and execute transactions and Smart contracts. The smart contracts are executed in TEEs — Trusted Execution Environment, which allows executing/processing data while encrypted. This is achieved by using Intel SGX processors that leverage secure enclaves. These processors allow for processing encrypted data without the need to decrypt it.\n\nIntel SGX is seen as very secure, and until now, there are no practical security vulnerabilities. However, there’s a big dependency of the Secret Network on Intel SGX processors, making Secret highly dependent on one single vendor. Certain questions like “what if one day a vulnerability on Intel SGX is discovered and exploited?” remain to be answered. Additionally, what happens if [Intel stops supporting the SGX chips](https://twitter.com/fireintheslums/status/1482389864708395008)?\n\n## **Bridging assets to Secret**\n\nTo mint Secret tokens (for example, sETH) one needs to send ETH to a smart contract that will mint the sETH. This is possible using the Secret Bridge: <https://bridge.scrt.network/>\n\nThese tokens (for example, sETH) are Secret’s SNIP20 standard is similar to ERC20.\n\nIn terms of adoption, one of the key strategies for development has been connecting to other networks with an existing user base and liquidity. The Secret Bridge currently supports 3 networks: Ethereum, BSC, and Monero. Terra bridge was also recently updated with the Supernova upgrade (using IBC), which is a bullish sign considering its fast growth.\n\nThe bridge supports dozens of tokens from Ethereum and BSC. It connects with Metamask and Keplr wallet to bridge the assets from/to Ethereum/BSC to Secret (Cosmos Keplr wallet). The bridge is bi-directional, meaning that we can send Ethereum, Binance Coin, and many other tokens to the Secret Network, which is going to be connected to the Keplr wallet (or another Cosmos compatible wallet).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*zYRxi4Oetc0\\_sAZYyfAGNg.png)\n\nHow does the bridging process works? First, the user sends ETH from Ethereum to Secret using the Secret bridge. The asset (ETH or an ERC20 token) will be locked in a smart contract on Ethereum and minted secretETH or sERC20, which are wrapped tokens on the Secret network, based on SNIP20. Users need to wait for 3 confirmations to see their assets on Secret. Then, to send the ETH or tokens from Secret back to Ethereum, the tokens are burned on Secret and released on Ethereum.\n\nThe gas fees to bridge to and from Ethereum are fairly high (because you still need to interact with Smart Contracts on the Ethereum blockchain), but the fees are low once the assets are on Secret. Secret’s interoperability leverages the Cosmos SDK, which allows developers to add plug-and-play modules, including the IBC — Inter-Blockchain Communication that allows networks to communicate with other IBC-enabled blockchains.\n\nSecret allows [sending native assets across IBC chains](https://wrap.scrt.network/) (inter-blockchain communication) — Cosmos, Ethereum, Polkadot, Avalanche, Fantom, and other chains.\n\n## **Token economics**\n\nThe Enigma tokens $ENG were replaced by $SCRT tokens in 2020.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*-nivBgBjuUz3zkAOSAE-lA.png)\n\nThe grants program (ecosystem pool) has 20 Million SCRT, which is approximately $100M as of March 2022. On top of that, the ecosystem fund received [additional $400M](https://scrt.network/blog/secret-network-400m-ecosystem-funding-new-investors) from HashKey, DeFiance Capital, Alameda Research, and CoinFund. In fact, the ecosystem fund has at the moment over 25 contributors.These grants will help to build applications on the network.\n\n$SCRT token is also used as a governance token to vote for community proposals. Proposals can be seen [here](https://secretnodes.com/secret/chains/secret-4/governance).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*cGh8cg-7iErW9sZK0n1-CA.png)\n\nThe project can also mint new coins to fund the development with voting approval. The Secret foundation receives 15% of all staking rewards as a foundation tax to support the development of the network.\n\nCurrent token supply: 163 B $SCRT\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*i6gttu3\\_F-m_Kwt7TE\\_5jQ.png)\n\nIs SCRT inflationary? The [average inflation rate is 15%](https://secretnodes.com/) (used to reward validators and delegates) [at a rate close to 25%](https://secretnodes.com/). This means that hodlers can easily offset the inflation effect by staking their SCRT.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*YYr30\\_tKWz2JiXPS8aB_TQ.png)\n\nSo, as we have seen, the number of stakers is increasing (which removes tokens from the circulating supply), the number of wallets has been increasing and the developer activity is also increasing.\n\n## **Governance**\n\nA portion of the tokens is allocated to initiatives related to the Secret Network committees. They aim to promote Secret and incentivize adoption and global growth. There are 9 committees.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*0g240WDn162P_CPOjM88LA.png)\n\nThe Awareness Committee seems to be one of the most important for Secret. They actively execute the marketing plan and do the “Secret Agent” recruitment. They do developer’s advocate work and earn 2% of all staking rewards as an incentive.\n\nSecret uses an on-chain governance system that derives from Cosmos. Users can submit proposals, vote, and have an active role on governance. To avoid spam, it is necessary to deposit 1000 SCRT in order to create a new proposal.\n\n## **Secret DeFi Ecosystem**\n\nThere are 3 DEXs on Secret: [SecretSwap](https://secretswap.net/) (SEFI), [SiennaSwap](https://app.sienna.network/) (SIENNA) and [btn.group](https://btn.group/) (BUTT).\n\nAlthough technologically sound, these DEXs have a microscopic size when compared for example to Osmosis (one of the biggest DeFi protocol on Cosmos). Osmosis TVL is at the time of this writing $1.6B. For comparison, SecretSwap TVL is approx. $37M, Sienna sits at $11M and the youngest DeFi protocol, the btn.group has only $1.2M in TVL. Considering their size, this may imply that the Secret DeFi protocols may have a huge upside although young and inherently risky.\n\nIn addition, there’s also the[ Secret Bridge](https://bridge.scrt.network/) to bridge asset and there’s one major NFT marketplace: [Stashh](https://stashh.io/).\n\nAnother important advantage of Secret is that Secret DEXs are front-running resistant. Front running is eliminated because transactions are private. Front running is a big problem in traditional markets and AMMs. Front running happens because the bad actor can see the incoming transactions and sandwich that transaction in order to increase its price against the trader. Privacy can solve this issue by making the pool of incoming transactions private. According to Secret’s website: “In other words, we have an encrypted mempool. This prevents malicious actors from gaining unfair advantages over honest users by watching the mempool. Therefore, Secret Network is in a great position to create a fairer DeFi ecosystem.”\n\nAnother advantage is that Secret minimizes MEV — Miner Extractable Value — by preventing the validators from seeing transaction data and reordering transactions for their benefit.\n\n## **NFTs on Secret**\n\nNFT owners can decide if they want to show their NFTs or not. There are multiple possibilities for NFTs.\n\nNFTs on Secret use the Secret NFT standard — SNIP-721. The NFT ecosystem can largely benefit from Secret advantages. Ethereum’s high transaction fees, low throughput, and lack of privacy allow Secret to stand out by providing low transaction fees, faster throughput, and privacy features.\n\nNFTs can have additional features such as “the ability to (1) hide ownership of scarce items, (2) privatize the metadata field (how an NFT signature connects to off-chain data like art), and (3) control access to the connected content.”\n\n## **Additional DeFi ecosystem development**\n\nA privacy-preserving stablecoin is also coming soon to the network. This stablecoin — [Silk](https://shadeprotocol.io/pdf/Silk_Whitepaper.pdf) — is backed by a basket of assets and it’s built on the top of the [Shade protocol](https://shadeprotocol.io/). The Silk stablecoin will inherit the privacy features from Secret and it will be interoperable with Osmosis, Juno and the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nSecret provides grants to incentivize application development. The grants come from the $400M ecosystem Fund and this is made with the mentorship from Secret Labs. The grant application and approved grants can be seen [here](https://github.com/scrtlabs/Grants/issues). If you would like to build on Secret but you don’t have a use case yet, make sure you check this [list of ideas.](https://scrt.network/grant-application-ideas)\n\n## **Secret Network Challenges**\n\n1.  Secret still need to bring critical mass to the network in order to bring network effects\n2.  Bring more developers and dApps onboard\n3.  Draw more attention from the crypto community\n4.  Although growing, the NFT ecosystem is still small. Secret needs to make a better work spreading the word to artists and NFT community\n5.  Dependency on Intel SGX processors\n\n## **Oasis Network**\n\n## **Overview**\n\nJust like Secret, Oasis Network goal is to be a privacy-enabled blockchain. The Oasis Network was founded in 2018 out of Berkley, University of California, by the hands of professor Dawn Song. In fact, Oasis continues to have strong ties to the academic community, having the largest University Program among all the L1 blockchains, including over [25 universities in the program](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-network-primer/) (including for example top universities like Berkley and Tsinghua). [The Oasis University Programs](https://oasisprotocol.org/university-program) seems to be one of the biggest sources of research and new projects that come from university hackathons.\n\nThe [public testnet](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/the-oasis-public-testnet-is-live-e1a04f4dfc22) was launched in Nov. 2019 and the [beta mainnet](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/the-oasis-network-starting-a-new-era-for-blockchain-100c6ef56373) was launched in Oct. 2020. The [production mainnet](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/oasis-mainnet-ushering-in-a-new-era-of-privacy-and-scalability-25379d152122) was launched one month after, in Nov. 2020. Although the production main net is live, the privacy features are not enabled yet.\n\nSo what is Oasis? Oasis is a privacy-focused Layer-1 smart contract blockchain network that uses the Cosmos SDK. Oasis achieves data-privacy and confidentiality by separating the consensus layer from the smart contract execution layer. The biggest advantage of Oasis is that it is a fully modular blockchain network that has at its core the consensus layer and it may have several paratime chains that communicate with the consensus layer.\n\nVersion:0.9 StartHTML:0000000105 EndHTML:0000000323 StartFragment:0000000141 EndFragment:0000000283\n\n## **The technology**\n\nOasis uses the proof-of-stake Tendermint consensus mechanism and it has [110 active validators](https://www.oasisscan.com/validators) that are elected via delegation. In this aspect, Oasis is pretty similar to Secret, just with a higher number of nodes.\n\nThe main difference between Oasis and other chains is that Oasis separates the consensus and execution into 2 layers, which theoretically provides better transaction speed and scalability. This allows multiple paratimes to process transactions in parallel, allowing for more efficient resource allocation, especially in regards to more complex workloads. These paratimes have their own segregated nodes and nodes may have different requirements for each paratime. For instance, the Cipher paratime uses TEE — Trusted Execution Environments that run on Intel SGX. This means that Cypher paratime is segregated and uses a separate set of nodes with TEE capabilities.\n\nIt’s important to note however that the Cypher paratime (i.e. Oasis privacy layer) is still in testing phase and not live yet. According to the Oasis moderators, the privacy layer will be available during H1 2022.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*WijGImwlEpvBqT8sLlfMlw.png)\n\nEVM compatibility: one of the biggest Oasis perks is the Emerald paratime. The Emerald paratime is the Oasis environment that is EVM compatible. It basically allows to deploy an EVM smart contract, including ERC20, ERC721 and 1155. This is great news for solidity developers that wish to leverage the easy portability and bring their Ethereum dApps to Oasis and to the Cosmos ecosystem. In the futures, these EVM dApps could also benefit of the data tokenization and privacy layers.\n\nEmerald can currently handle 1000 tps and according to the [Oasis Foundation block explorer](https://explorer.emerald.oasis.dev/), it was handling around 200 000 transactions per day in February 2022. Then, in early March, the number of transactions spiked to over 2 million per day, which is a weird number considering the real activity going on the network and the fact that this can clog the EVM transactions.\n\nTalking about throughput, each Oasis paratime can handle up to 1000tps but considering that Oasis can handle multiple paratimes, the throughput can in theory scale up to hundreds of thousands transactions per second just by deploying additional paratimes.\n\nParatimes are quite versatile. Users (for example institutional users) can create their own customizable paratimes (emerald for EVM, Cypher for privacy or Parcel for data tokenization). Rust is the main language but the Emerald paratime also handles Solidiity.\n\nThis customization is a great invitation for organizations to use and transact on Oasis, considering that they can segregate their nodes and keep the data private, while benefiting from the Oasis network and consensus layer.\n\nOasis is part of the Cosmos ecosystem but it doesn’t support IBC — the Inter Blockchain Communication yet. According to the roadmap, the IBC support should have [arrived Q3/Q4 2021](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/oasis-network-roadmap-e8019f81c864) and it should become fully implemented during the first half of 2022 (not too far away; I guess good things take time). The IBC would be great news for ROSE (the Oasis native token) considering that it will allow interoperability between Oasis and the other IBC networks (Osmosis, Cosmos, Juno, Terra and of course, Secret). Considering that Osmosis is the biggest DeFi platform on Cosmos ([$1.81B TVL](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/oasis-network-roadmap-e8019f81c864)), bringing ROSE to [Osmosis pools](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/oasis-network-roadmap-e8019f81c864) could be a very good additional source of demand for the token and drive some positive price action.\n\nOne of the most recent achievements of the Oasis was the Wormhole portal integration that allows bridging assets from/to Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, BSC, Terra and Oasis.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*tO9c1BaiuacTn7bWgk9\\_Ag.png)\n\n## **Social media and community**\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/OasisProtocol) — 158,000 followers\n\n[Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/oasisnetwork/?hl=en)— 6,400 followers\n\n[YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC35UFPcZ2F1wjPxhPrSsESQ)— 4,800 followers\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/oasisprotocolcommunity) — 58,300 followers\n\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/8tUba8eqSw) — 11,800 followers\n\n## **Social media and community**\n\nThe Oasis [roadmap](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/community/discussions/29) has a number of upgrades and milestones but the ones below seem to be the most relevant in terms of bringing a positive impact to the network.\n\n1.  IBC planned for H1 2022\n2.  Cypher paratime (privacy layer) is planned to go live H1 2022\n3.  Partnership with Meta also planned for 2022\n\n## **Use cases, ecosystem and developer ecosystem**\n\nOasis allows the creation of smart contracts developed on Rust or Solidity using the Emerald paratime. However, the EVM side of Oasis will not be compatible with the Cypher paratime (the privacy layer), meaning that EVM assets — for example ERC20 tokens bridged to Oasis via Emerald, would have to be bridged again to Cypher in order to gain the privacy layer. This adds complexity to dApps trying to develop on Oasis.\n\nOasis privacy-preserving layer comes with the Cypher paratime smart contracts, which can be seen as almost a segregated chain inside the Oasis network. The Cypher nodes will run on Intel SGX. This will be positive not only for the confidentiality of transactions but also to stop DEX front-running, to allow users to keep their assets and NFTs private, and allow sharing data with CeFi in order to unlock the undercollateralized loan market.\n\nFinally, the Parcel paratime can tokenize data in a private manner which is great for existing use cases such as [Nebula Genomics](https://nebula.org/oasis-labs-partnership/), [Genetica](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/private-genome-sequencing-with-genetica-and-the-oasis-network-23a0d9c083a7), and [BMW](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/driving-innovation-with-differential-privacy-620a31e3d61f). This data tokenization can potentially unlock a vast data market where people can be rewarded for sharing their data without having to reveal their identities (for example, sharing genomics data or driving behavior).\n\nIn fact, according to [this Oasis post](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/driving-innovation-with-differential-privacy-620a31e3d61f), BMW has tested the privacy capabilities of the network, aiming to increase data security and compliance with data regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Oasis data tokenization institutions to access to some of the data without relating it to the user/ provider of that data, which potentially unlocks many use cases.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*d5-NI-3SymU7fOHkHYdF6Q.png)\n\nThe image above shows data being shared from the user’s data capsule (using Oasis Parcel and Cypher) to DeFi lending platforms. The data sharing keeps the user’s identity private, while allowing at the same time the DeFi lending platforms to look at other data points that will allow to access the credit risk, thus enabling better DeFi risk management and undercollateralized loans which when compared to the current overcollateralized model, could unlock billions of dollars in the lending market.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*zy8eAHvE1ATMDCb5Ud5vKQ.png)\n\nData tokenization is already unlocking use cases where users can “stake” their data through the Oasis network and the data can be used by data consumers (social media apps, trading apps, healthcare, etc.). Users can in theory be rewarded for “staking” or lending their data. The model sounds very promising by flipping the ownership of personal data to the user rather than the company the user interacts with. However the model still needs to be proven to work at scale.\n\n## **Token economics**\n\nThe $ROSE token was launched in Nov. 2020 with 1.5 billion tokens supply, and the supply is caped at 10 billion. As of March 6, 2022, the circulating supply is 3.5 billion $ROSE, representing only 35% of the total.\n\nThe ROSE token is used for staking, delegation and transaction fees.\n\nThe tokens will be released according to a vesting schedule that is divided between staking rewards, ecosystem, partnerships, backers, contributors and the staking. It will take around 12 years to be close to the 10 billion $ROSE issuance.\n\nThe biggest cliffs/token releases happen at T+12 and T+18, which counting from the launch of the mainnet in 18th Nov. 2020, correspond to 18th Nov. 2021 and 18th May 2022.\n\nEach of these 2 big unlocks is unlocking approx.. 1.4 Billion tokens which would in theory represent a big selling pressure. However, although the Nov. 2021 release represented additional 66% token supply in the market, the price impact was minimal. The price declined by 12% on Nov. 18th but re-bounced right after that, going from $0.268 to $0.416 on Nov 21st — a 55% jump.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*nJudc8U0XTc1z65V37jQpQ.png)\n\nThe minimal price impact of the increased supply may be partially explained by the fact that a good part of the tokens was released to the “Community & Ecosystem” slice of the pie, which aims to foster the development of the apps and provide developer grants and community incentives. Consequently, these tokens will be slowly distributed, mostly to new projects or community initiatives, rather than suddenly dumped in the market.\n\nThe May 18th 2022 release will also see 1.4 Billion tokens arriving to the market, which will represent another big circulating supply increase, this time approx.. 40%. We are curious to see how is this going to impact the market. Perhaps a good opportunity to buy?\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*pZfYhmO7dL\\_3lV4-uTkD9g.png)\n\nAfter May 2022 and until Nov. 2024, $ROSE circulating supply will increase by 0.8B ROSE per year, and then it will reduce to 0.2B new $ROSE every year until 2031.\n\nStaking ROSE allows users to earn up to 12% APY (for validator nodes) or 10.21% for delegating ROSE.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*XqJW6Qvgo27h8LugbLvF2g.png)\n\nBy the way, if you see a better APY on some exchanges like Binance and start to ask yourself why stake on Oasis if Binance pays more than double the APY? Well, the simple answer is that the Binance staking has a very limited quota. In this case, the limit to get the 27% APY is merely 500 ROSE tokens (i.e. approx. $100).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*3Y4Ha84lUPapNh084XwuHQ.png)\n\nThe Oasis staking (both delegating or running a node) has been showing a very healthy increase, gaining 18.4% stakers over the last month. The taking participation was at the time of this writing at approx. 54%.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*1uQFbTzh4yTJfD9--F6f6g.png)\n\nThe Oasis staking (both delegating or running a node) has been showing a very healthy increase, gaining 13.8% staking participation over the last month, taking the staking participation to 54.3%.\n\n## **Governance**\n\nInspired by the [Meritocratic Governance Model](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel) used by The Apache Software Foundation, Oasis uses a democratic, consensus-based and community led governance model which works mostly off-chain.\n\nAnyone interested in supporting the network can join the community and contribute with proposals that can go from feature requests to bug fixes. The proposals are submitted and recorded on GitHub.\n\nThe proposal discussion and voting is done off-chain but the Oasis Foundation plan to migrate the process to an on-chain process.\n\n## **DeFi Ecosystem**\n\nWith a TVL of $148M, the Oasis TVL comes mainly from ValleySwap and Yuzu Swap, both Decentralized Exchanges on the Emerald paratime. The bridging between other networks and Oasis can be done via Wormhole Portal.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*3fB0TSQAmmvTWMaDLx4-ow.png)\n\nDevelopers looking to develop dApps on Oasis can leverage the [Oasis Community Garden](https://oasisrose.garden/) which has some useful resources from how to run a node, how to apply for grants, knowledgebase, official wallet and so on.\n\nAlthough the [Oasis ecosystem page](https://oasisrose.garden/ecosystem/) reports more projects, according to [Defillama](https://defillama.com/chain/Oasis) there are 10 active DeFi platforms on Oasis. Together, they sum $162M in TVL as off 8th March.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*AVTRloPmOI_dWYfoNw_Zyw.png)\n\nThe Oasis ecosystem seems to be blooming with multiple applications on lending, DEX, DAOs and upcoming NFT collections. This is probably due to allocations related to the Ecosystem Fund and it may be a good driver for the ROSE price in the near future.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*lSRL6UOnLk0UtsGZm3fOAw.png)\n\nThe Oasis developer activity has been increasing and diverging from the ROSE price. This may be a bullish sign considering that the developers continue betting on building applications and improving Oasis. Developer activity is usually a lagging indicator but in this case, we can see that Oasis developers (including the ones developing applications in the ecosystem) continue to bet on the network.\n\nWhat are other applications launching on Oasis? A good chunk of the applications being launched on Oasis are beneficiaries from the Oasis Foundation Ecosystem grants (the $200 Million fund). These applications also contribute to the developer activity that we see above. This is probably also the explanation why many of the applications listed on [Oasis website](https://oasisrose.garden/ecosystem/) are shown as “coming soon”.\n\nCurrently, there are 6 DEX, 1 bridge and 2 lending protocols (although we could only see one working). Note that half of the DEXes have low liquidity and TVLs under 4M.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*ugO3WsfwA0I3W0qNBc00Ug.png)\n\nRegarding the NFT market the NFT activity comes mainly from the [tofuNFT](https://tofunft.com/oasis) platform which is a NFT marketplace/ aggregator for a number of networks, including Oasis and other 24 blockchain networks. There’s also some residual NFT activity coming from [MetaMirror](https://auth3.network/metamirror/), mainly due to the [AI Rose collection](https://auth3.network/metamirror/gallery/airose/).\n\nWhat kind of NFT collections can you find on Oasis? Well, as in many other chains, you will find knock-off collections like Oasis Apes, Oasis Punks and Oasis Doodles. You will also find some original collections like [Dope Wolves](https://dopewolves.com/) (they are indeed dope), [Pixel Oasis](https://pixeloasis.io/) and the [TWCC collection](https://thewealthycrocodilesclub.com/).\n\n**The Ecosystem Fund**\n\nIn January 2022, the Oasis Foundation announced that the [Ecosystem fund has a total of $200 Million](https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/binance-labs-backs-the-oasis-ecosystem-fund-to-support-the-projects-building-on-oasis-network-f6bcb3be6ee4) from contributors such as Binance Labs and other big names such as Dragonfly Capital, Draper Dragon, Electric Capital, FBG, Hashed, Jump Capital, Kenetic Capital and Pantera. The goal of the ecosystem fund is similar to other ecosystem funds: to empower and support applications, including DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse, and other dApps to develop on the Oasis Ecosystem. During the first 2 months of the Ecosystem fund has distributed over $2.5 Million. Probably this is one of the reasons why we can see the developer activity increasing on Oasis.\n\nPart of the ecosystem fund comes from large backers and investors: Oasis has a long role of key investors that include names like Arrington Capital, Binance Labs, Bitmain, Blockchain Capital, Electric Capital, Pantera, Polychain, Winklevoss Capital and A16Z.\n\nFinally, another driver for engaging with the community is the ambassador program where Oasis enthusiasts can apply to join the program and be [rewarded for completing tasks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xkx2194BDYIWDr8Y4KdRrzgIe5yGkScW6Tt3\\_dgKJgU/edit#gid=0) related community building, developers advocacy, social media activity and so on.\n\n## **Oasis Network Challenges**\n\n1.  The Cypher paratime (privacy layer) is not yet deployed at the time of writing this report. It will have to prove itself and be hardened by real network activity\n2.  The Emerald paratime still suffers from transaction flooding (almost at DDoS attack level) by arbitrage spamming bots. This may sometimes slow down user’s transaction speed\n3.  Bring more developers and dApps onboard\n4.  Draw more attention from the crypto community\n5.  Although growing, the NFT ecosystem is still small\n6.  The Cypher paratime may be dependent on Intel SGX processors\n7.  Better developer support may also be needed\n\n## **Horizen Network**\n\n## **Overview**\n\nLet’s start with a cool fact that maybe you didn’t know (at least I didn’t know it before start researching Horizen) — Horizen is the top blockchain in terms of node count: it has the largest node network with [approx. 44,700 nodes](https://www.horizen.io/node-hosting/) (although some are hosted by cloud providers). Bitcoin is considered a good example of decentralization but it has “only” 15700 nodes. I guess we can say that Horizen has a truly decentralized network.\n\nHorizen uses a cross-chain protocol called Zendoo. This protocol allows developers to build highly modular blockchains and applications, with a better degree of flexibility even when compared to Cosmos or Polkadot.\n\nThe network uses a robust Proof of Work consensus mechanism, it leverages zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARK) for privacy-preserving transactions and uses SDKs for highly modular design and development. Developers can also develop their own chains on the top of Horizen in a very customizable fashion.\n\nYou can see Horizen as a public blockchain with a large node network and on top of it, developers can build any number of customizable side-chains. This is where they can enable the privacy layer. How does this help scalability and privacy? By allowing developers to develop their own Horizen sidechains — which anyone can do by using the Zendoo SDK — developers can build their tailor-made sidechains that can be public or private, have a customizable consensus and, depending on the dApp, a separate crypto-economy.\n\nZendoo is at the core of this Horizon ecosystem and scalability. The SDK is zk-SNARK enabled which brings the privacy layer to the Horizen dApps, whenever developers decide that they need to use that privacy layer. Zk-SNARKs also allows cross-chain verifiable transactions without the need for third-party validators. This means that the Horizen mainchain can verify/audit transactions and keep the consensus of any number of transactions happening in any Zendoo-enabled sidechains in almost real-time.\n\nThe [side-chain SDK](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sidechains-SDK) is available for anyone and it allows developers to customize their new sidechains, enable Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) if they want to talk with other Horizen chains, the privacy with zk-SNARK, proof of stake consensus (although Horizen main chain is proof of work, sidechains can be proof of stake), different kinds of transactions, wallets, etc. According to Horizen this sidechain SDK — Blaze — can handle up to 10M TPS (yes, I mean 10 million; that’s on Horizen’s website); how was it tested to handle 10M transactions I don’t know but if accurate, it could even handle data warehousing, AI, data analytics and potentially large volumes of IOT devices, which is a missing piece in the blockchain industry. The team is also building Latus which will allow for a higher decentralization and up to 20k TPS.\n\nHorizen team has according to social media approx. 40 employees and in addition also relies on [IOHK](https://www.horizen.io/team/) (Charles Hoskinson’s company also responsible for Cardano development) for research and development (among other tier 1 partners). In fact, Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, and Ethereum co-founder was also involved in the [Horizen development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPojOC2MAbY\\&feature=youtu.be).\n\nFinally, kudus to the Horizen team for having such a well-organized website, documentation and helpful community.\n\n## **Social media and community**\n\nThe Horizen community seems to be fairly active and solid. The platform incentivizes the community to continue contributing to the ecosystem and continue building on the top of Horizen.\n\n[Twitter ](https://twitter.com/horizenglobal)— 137,000 followers\n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/horizenglobal/) — 11,900 followers\n\n[Medium ](https://medium.com/@horizen)— 15,300 followers\n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ0v_lUnZHIKUQUXJzfgqOg) — 25,500 followers\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/horizencommunity) — 4,840 followers\n\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv) — 8,000 followers\n\n## **Milestones for 2022**\n\nHorizen seems to consistently execute the roadmap according to the plan, which is infrequent in the crypto space. Among other milestones, Horizen plans to:\n\n1.  Implement EVM compatibility\n2.  Launch a multi-token wallet\n3.  Launch DeFi apps on EVM sidechains (this will probably unlock the DeFi ecosystem on Horizen which at the moment is almost inexistent)\n4.  Although not part of the Horizen roadmap, I’m personally looking for other bullish news considering the community involved: the integration with the BAYC fungible token. A question that is still remaining is: if and how can this token exist in parallel with the Ape Coin.\n\nRight after @Boredapyc community announced the partnership with Horizen, it was also announced that Horizen purchased the Bored Ape #6709 for ETH100 (approx. $420 000).\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1098/1\\*\\_tR1tbxI0uvQ2HddU-WHJw.png)\n\n## **Network Metrics**\n\nThe 44 700 nodes are divided into [3 kinds of nodes](https://www.horizen.io/zennodes/): the regular nodes, secure nodes and super nodes. Users can either setup their own node according to the requirements or rely on one of the providers that sell the “node as a service” service.\n\nRewards for running a node are attractive considering the fairly low cost of running these nodes when comparing to the rewards. A super node, for example, costs around $10 per month (using one of the [“node-as-a-service”](https://www.horizen.io/node-hosting/) providers, while the rewards ([block rewards](https://www.horizen.io/zennodes/)) can be up to $100 per month. It takes 500 ZEN to stake and participate, which as off March 2021 would be approx. $21 000. This would represent a 5% APY on the staked ZEN. Not too shabby.\n\nA secure node on the other hand costs approx. $3 and rewards $11 per month considering current ZEN prices. It requires the user to stake 42 ZEN (approx. $1800) and the APY over that staking would be 7.5%. Side note, there’s no traditional staking (like Secret and Oasis) on Horizen. To “stake” stakeholders need to run a securenode or a supernode and receive a reward for doing so. Securenodes require a collateral of 42 ZEN, and supernodes 500 ZEN respectively.\n\n## **Use cases, ecosystem and developer ecosystem**\n\nIf blockchains like Ethereum and Solana are an army knife, [Horizen is a blank canvas](https://dappradar.com/blog/customize-your-own-crypto-economy) where developers can build anything. What about Polkadot and Cosmos? Well, they allow for better flexibility for developers to build their own chains — the previous 2 networks in this report — Secret and Oasis are built on Cosmos. However, they are tied to the same consensus mechanism, and on Polkadot case, the 100 paratimes have to rely on [just 300 validators](https://polkadot.subscan.io/validator).\n\nHorizen on the other hand has a very flexible architecture and consequently, it can handle multiple use cases.\n\nSome examples of the existing use cases (some of them leveraging the privacy features) include DeFi applications, CeFi entities and other blockchain networks. Some examples include Celsius which uses [Horizen’s ZK audit](https://celsius.network/zk-audit) for DeFi. [Dash partnered with Horizen](https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-and-dash-partnership-announcement/) to “develop a fully decentralized, data protection solution using zero-knowledge proofs that anyone can use to build their own independent reward marketing programs.” The Morpheus Network leverages Horizen’s Zendoo for [its supply-chain platform](https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-and-morpheus-network-partnership-announcement/), and the IOTA collaboration allowing connecting [IOTA oracles](https://blog.horizen.io/iota-and-horizen-partner-to-expand-iota-oracles-and-zendoo/) with Zendoo.\n\nThe developer ecosystem has been showing an uptrend pretty much since April 2019. Usually, developer activity is a lagging indicator. First we see the price going up and then we see new developers coming to the network. However, in this case, we see the opposite: the developer activity keeps increasing despite the price decline. This may be a positive sign for the network adoption.\n\n## **Token economics**\n\nZEN has a well thought and interesting token economics. Unlike many other protocols, there was no pre-mining, or ICO. Horizen was a chain forked from another network called Zclassic at block 110,000.\n\nSimilarly to Bitcoin, total number of coins to be minted is 21,000,000. The blocktime is around 2.5 minutes, but it can vary depending on the difficulty and amount of hash on the network. Although part of the Horizen mining may resemble Bitcoin, the reward distribution is different and rewards other stakeholders other than miners alone. Miners, validators and nodes are currently rewarded with 6.25 ZEN that is divided in the following way:\n\n● 10% (0.625 ZEN) going to the supernodes for distribution to all eligible supernodes\n\n● 10% (0.625 ZEN) going to the securenodes for distribution to all eligible securenodes\n\n● 20% (1.25 ZEN) going to the Horizen Block Foundation\n\n● 60% (3.75 ZEN + fees) going to the miners\n\nThis is seen by Horizen as a more fair distribution that rewards other important network participants, such as the node operators and also the Horizen Foundation.\n\nThe mining part has some similarities with Bitcoin: the total supply of 21 million coins, the block size of 2MB (vs 1MB for Bitcoin) and the fact that the block reward is halved every 4 years (just like Bitcoin). Horizen uses the Equihash hashing algorithm for mining with Digishield for difficulty adjustment and protection against 51% attacks.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*jshWvlQmABgkAYcQ8vyN3Q.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*RLAYuftz6DRAmY8Sin\\_7Wg.png)\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*VpH7mwk9nfGMgv-d5ztC1Q.png)\n\nThe Zen tokens can live in 2 different places: the T-addresses which are regular public addresses (just like Bitcoin for example) and Z-addresses which are the privacy addresses. The transactions between Z-addresses are private and anonymous.\n\nTo manage ZEN, Horizen offers the [Sphere wallet](https://www.horizen.io/spherebyhorizen/), which supports the 2 types of addresses above and it even has a cool chat feature that allows users to send encrypted messages through the blockchain. Other than Sphere, Horizen is also supported by many tier 1 wallets like [Ledger, Coinomi, Abra and others](https://www.horizen.io/wallets/).\n\nZEN also has a [list](https://www.horizen.io/merchants/) of merchants and payment gateways accepting it (which is uncommon and a good differentiator when compared to the other projects that we have looked into in this research).\n\n## **Governance**\n\nHorizen uses the Horizen Improvement Proposal System ([ZenIP](https://www.horizen.io/assets/files/Horizen-White-Paper.pdf)) in order to push protocol upgrades and any major changes to the network. Developers can propose new ideas by creating a pull request against the [ZenIP repository](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs). After being discussed, voted and tested, the proposal can finally be activated on Horizen’s mainnet.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*9G979OLpTiHCcJ8mZAPTMA.png)\n\nProjects building on Horizen can also use the voting system that was implemented by the network in collaboration with IPHK and leverages zk-SNARKs. It basically allows for secret voting and Zen holders vote is weighted according to the locked up stake value. Users can either vote directly or similarly to a representative democracy, they can delegate their votes to an “expert”.\n\nIn addition, Horizen also has a Community Council that organizes and brings topics to the Zen Blockchain Foundation.\n\n## **DeFi ecosystem**\n\nHorizen is yet to have the capabilities to build the DeFi ecosystem. The tokenization platform is at the time of this writing on testnet. It is scheduled for H2 2022 for the network to kick off the DeFi applications on the network.\n\n## **Network challenges**\n\n1.  EVM compatibility hasn’t been deployed yet\n2.  The DeFi ecosystem is yet to be tested\n3.  Incumbents\n\n## **Phala Network**\n\n## **Overview**\n\nThe Phala Network was born in Beijing and it tackles the issue of trust in the computation cloud. It aims to be a cloud computing network that offers cloud computing services like Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud but built on the web3 tenets of trust and decentralization.\n\nPhala implements a confidential smart contract built on TEE-based privacy technology embedded into processors compatible with TEEs such as the Intel SGX, so that the data transfer and computational cloud can run on the confidential layer. Phala Network is also a Substrate-based interoperable cross chain confidential smart contract platform, and as a member of the Kusama (KSM) parachain. The network it will be able to provide computational power for other blockchain applications with protecting the data layer enabling possibilities that run across privacy protection, DeFi, trading positions and transaction history.\n\nIt is safe to say that the Phala Network is also the first Smart Contract platform to provide a token bridge collaboration with [Bitcoin Gold](https://bitcoingold.org/phala-network-partners-with-bitcoin-gold/).\n\n## **The technology**\n\nThe Phala Network can be considered an innovation for Web3 that combines a few technologies that ensure a trustless cloud-based computing with many potential use cases.\n\nSimilarly to the Secret Network, Phala also run confidential smart contracts. Both rely on hardware enclaves, using Intel SGX TEEs. However, while Secret is part of the Cosmos ecosystem and relies on its own Cosmos based network for the consensus layer, Phala relies on Polkadot. Another important difference in the Phala architecture is that Phala adopted a rollup architecture, separating the consensus layer and the computation/execution layer.\n\nCurrently, Phala is using the[ Khala network](https://www.phala.network/en/khala/), which is a Kusama parachain (Kusama is Polkadot’s canary chain). Phala recently won a [Polkadot parachain](https://parachains.info/details/phala_network) (March 31, 2022) and it will transiction to it sometime in 2022.\n\nPhala’s network is capable of scaling the computation capacity, aiming to potentially complete with other big cloud providers like AWS, Azure and google Cloud. Although far from offering the range of services offered by traditional cloud providers, Phala has around 30 000 vCPUs (virtual CPUs) that are provided by approximately 23 000 workers. These workers are computers that join the network to provide computation power to the network. This is also referred to as “Secure Worker Mining”.\n\nTo be one of these workers/miners, the participant is [required](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/mine/khala-mining/1-0-hardware-requirements/) to have a computer equipped with Intel SGX.\n\nThis computation layer where Phala’s fat contracts take place. In Phala’s terminology, fat contracts are not smart contracts. Instead, they are basically the layer where dApps can have access to the decentralized cloud computing network that is provided by the miners. The fat contract layer allows dApps to have access to real-time, low latency compute power, and access to internet services.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*X3UBgNz2\\_6QiiZsA1hYRiA.png)\n\nPhala also has a network of gatekeepers that are responsible for the block production and key management. These gatekeepers need to stake PHA and they are elected on blockchain by NPoS — Nominated Proof of Stake — mechanism similar to Polkadot. Gatekeeper’s stake and reputation may be slashed for misbehavior or downtime.\n\nPhala is built and connected to Polkadot via Substrate framework for building customized blockchains much easier. In fact, Substrate was built out of Polkadot’s codebase.\n\nParity, the company behind Substrate also built the Polkadot network which is a decentralized, protocol based blockchain platform for enabling secure cross-blockchain communication. Polkadot can be seen as a means to network between blockchains, taking care of the communication problem even between systems and probably helping Phala’s interoperability in the future.\n\n## **Social media and community**\n\nAlthough smaller, the Phala seems to be active and quite helpful on their Discord channel. The following links are where to connect with the Phala community and learn more about their network.\n\n[Twitter ](https://twitter.com/PhalaNetwork)— 119,000 followers\n\n[Medium](https://phalanetwork.medium.com/) — 2,100 followers\n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/PhalaNetwork) — 4,600 followers\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/phalanetwork) — 26,000 followers\n\n[Discord ](https://discord.com/invite/phala)— 5,300 followers\n\n## **Milestones for 2022**\n\nIn recent activities and reports from the project, a few projections were stated: “In 2022, Phala will concentrate on mainnet launch, product optimization, and ecosystem growth. We are excited to show you our vision and goals on Fat Contract and Web3 cloud etc.”\n\nAlso, further reports show that the Phala team is looking to work on the following:\n\n● Win a Polkadot parachain and migrate from Khala (Kusama) [to Polkadot](https://parachains.info/details/phala_network) mainnet\n\n● Updates to the Phala networks and PRuntime\n\n● Phala World; A community Metaverse built on the Phala network\n\n● Render services for 3D NFTs in collaboration with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)\n\n● Expanding the Wb3 cloud infrastructure to include additional services, including decentralized storage integration\n\n● AMD SEV integration — to reduce the dependency on Intel SGX\n\n● Continue expanding fact contracts scalability\n\n● Phala World — Phala World’s NFTs — a Metaverse/NFT game to bring the Phala community to the metaverse\n\n**Token economics**\n\nThe native token for the Phala Network is PHA. Only about 272,000,000 PHA tokens are currently in circulation, and more tokens are gradually being released to the community through mining, airdrops, and sales.\n\nAccording to its whitepaper, the economics the Phala network was built on was on the basis of addressing the following point:\n\n**1. **Supporting trustless cloud computing architecture: this can be up 100,000\n\nworkers/miners (23 000 at the time of this writing)\n\n**2. **Incentive miners to join the network: pay miners for power supplied irrespective of demand at network bootstrap\n\n**3. **Incentivize on-chain performance\n\n**4. **Governance: PHA is the native utility token of Phala Network and is used for a security guarantee, governance, purchasing trusted computing resources and data exchange fees.\n\nThe distribution of this token is as follows:\n\n• TEE miners: 70%\n\n• Private Sale: 15%\n\n• Ecosystem Building & Parachain Auction: 9%\n\n• Team Incentive: 5%\n\n• Testnet Incentive: 1%\n\n## **Governance**\n\nUsers are expected to hold a certain amount of PHA token to be able to join the Phala DAO and participate in the community voting, decision making and proposals. These stakeholders manage the Phala/Khala network and community. [Khala](https://khala.subsquare.io/) is the pre-mainnet for Phala network, it helps to catch on problems and failures early enough before the mainnet launch.\n\nThe Phala network is yet to be launched into mainnet hence the Khala network will use the Polkadot and Kusama for their governance mechanism. This ensures the DAO activities are accessible to the blockchain network and stakes are commanded.\n\nIn order for this to happen, active stakeholders (the community) council members and technical members will weigh in to make sure the majority of the stakes can command the state of the network. Even though the proposal will be submitted by the public or council members it will have to go through a voting process to let all stakeholders make a decision.\n\n## **Dero Network**\n\n## **Overview**\n\nDero brings to the crypto space innovative ways of keeping data private and it’s definitely a trailblazer when it comes to data encryption. Dero is a general-purpose, private and scalable decentralized application platform that allows developers to deploy dApps that let users retain total control over their assets with complete privacy. Dero achieves this by using homomorphic encryption.\n\nDero has been developed from scratch in Golang by three anonymous developers and is still being actively developed by the 3 original anon developers. Dero’s developer team seems to have the experience in cryptography and multiple years of experience in blockchain development. However, the [developer community and activity](https://github.com/deroproject) seems to be currently small.\n\nLaunched in 2017, Dero is a homomorphically encrypted protocol that can serve both individuals and businesses worldwide, with fast and anonymous transactions (up to 750 tps), smart contracts written in BASIC, and a service model.\n\nDero’s objective is to provide high grade privacy tools and private networks to the general public with commonly available CPUs and hardware in the market and not depending on any specific hardware. To do this, Dero uses the AstroBWT mining algorithm which can run on any CPU. In fact it seems that the majority of the Dero community is [mining Dero](https://docs.dero.io/rtd_pages/basic_mining.html) on regular CPUs, without the need for specialized ASIC miners due to Dero’s ASIC resistant algorithm, which is good for decentralization.\n\n## The technology\n\nThe common consensus in the crypto market is usually proof of work, proof of stake, and some times Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) and respective variations. Proof of work blockchains focus on security at the cost of speed (Bitcoin is an example of this, with an average block time of about 10 minutes) while DAG block structure offers increased speed at the expense of security.\n\nDero was initially written in Golang but later on, the Atlantis codebase was then developed and the project migrated to the Atlantis codebase which decreased the block time and made transactions much faster.\n\nDero is a hybrid blockchain, with an average block time of about 18 seconds. It is the first blockchain protocol to employ the integration of the proof of work mechanism with Directed Acyclic Graph block structure while ensuring anonymity.\n\nTo achieve confidentiality, Dero is homomorphically encrypted. A typical blockchain stores all information on the chain in clear text and uses a UXTO model but Dero uses a unique encrypted blockchain with an account-based model, thus creating a secure and private network. This homomorphic encryption is what makes Dero different when compared to other privacy networks discussed in this report.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\*tkaURv8KQYeKN4yiGyLlJw.png)\n\nBy now, you may be asking “What the heck is homomorphic encryption?” Homomorphic encryption or HE is a type of encryption that allows users to perform computations over encrypted data without requiring access to a decryption key. The resulting computations remain encrypted and all the data on the blockchain is encrypted. All this happens without depending on specialized hardware or TEE — Trusted Execution Environments — used on Secret Network or Oasis.\n\nHomomorphic encryption can be used to preserve the privacy of any or all the data stored on the network’s nodes. This can be a good alternative to TEEs and ZK-snarks. It’s a highly researched technology but it seems to be the least adopted when it comes to achieving privacy in the crypto space.\n\nDero Homomorphic Encryption Blockchain Protocol (DHEBP) is a new protocol (and the first that we have seen until now) used for scalable confidential transactions and private smart contract execution. It is decentralized, private, and scalable. The DHEBP employs an account-based structure that removes the requirement for scanning UTXOs, which allows wallets to provide instant balances to users.\n\nDero is the first blockchain project to use self-signed TLS encryption for its network communication. Dero also utilizes UDP for peer-to-peer communication instead of TCP. This means that there’s end-toend encryption and all the data-in-transit is encrypted all the time.\n\nDero is also the first smart contract network using CryptoNote. CryptoNote has been used to improve the privacy of coins such as Monero, Bytecoin, Aeon coin, Karbo and DigitalNote. Through the use of CryptoNote, Dero never reveals the identity of the sender and recipient of a transaction, ensuring full anonymity. Account balances and data cannot be decrypted by the blockchain. Only whoever has the account can access and decrypt their data.\n\nIn summary, if I send a transaction, which is a basic Dero transfer or coin transfer from my wallet, my wallet encrypts this transaction before broadcasting it to the network. Note that this is an exception to most of the blockchain networks. Typically, in public blockchains, there’s a lot of cryptography going on but it’s mostly related to digital signatures and hashing and not so much with data encryption.\n\nThrough some cryptography magic, the transactions can be verified without decrypting the data. Homomorphic Encryption never decrypts the data and no one can see who is receiving or who is sending, or even what kind of transaction was sent. Only the send and recipient of the transaction have access to it.\n\n## **Social media and community**\n\nThe DERO project keeps users informed as often as possible while still providing newsworthy information. Although smaller, the Discord community is fairly active.\n\n[Twitter ](https://twitter.com/DeroProject)— 12,000 followers\n\n[Reddit ](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeroProject)— 2,000 followers\n\n[Telegram](https://t.me/DeroProjectGroup) — 4,300 followers\n\n[Discord ](https://discord.com/invite/2rccWbb)— 4,900 followers\n\n## **Milestones for 2022**\n\nThe DERO team has achieved some major milestones since the project’s inception. These include:\n\n1.  Creation of the Dero foundation\n2.  Listing of the coin on larger exchanges (Kucoin)\n3.  Increasing exposure with help of notable industry players, mining pools, and community efforts\n4.  Security auditing\n\nIn March 2022, the Stargate upgrade with private smart contracts and services launched on mainnet, now enabling smart contracts on the network. Stargate also included software upgrades and a new wallet. This was a major milestone for Dero and it’s likely to unlock new use cases for the network, as well as bring more developers to develop new dApps.\n\n## **Use cases and ecosystem**\n\nThere are many potential uses cases for the Dero protocol. However, considering that the smart contract functionality was only implemented recently, the dApp ecosystem is still small.\n\n## **Token economics**\n\nThe DERO coin is the means of exchange within the network and just like most smart contract blockchains, it is also used to pay network fees related to the smart contracts.\n\nThe Dero coin supply resembles Bitcoin: it is hard capped at 21 million coins and the block reward halves every 4 years. There’s an interesting difference when compared to Bitcoin: on Dero, all the rewards are shared with all the miners, as if all the Dero miners are part of a big mining pool. Additional Dero stats can be seen [here](https://derostats.io/) and [here](https://network.dero.io/).\n\n## **Governance**\n\nDevelopers usually submit proposals for blockchain improvements and a core group of developers will coordinate consensus between stakeholders. Governance is on-chain.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nMost of us agree that privacy is important, Considering that we are moving our finances and assets to the Web3 space, we will need blockchain protocols that ensure that level of privacy.\n\nMost likely, none of the networks analyzed in this report will be the “Ethereum killer”. That’s not the goal. The goal is to create networks that allow assets, people and smart contracts to interact with a layer of privacy.\n\nAll these technologies **Secret, Oasis, Horizen, Phala, Dero**, try to tackle the privacy issue in unique ways. From using TEEs, zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption, they all use complex encryption methods in order to protect user’s privacy. They have all designed and implemented beautiful cryptographic solutions. However, they are also in different development stages. While Secret and Oasis already have their respective DeFi ecosystems that have been attracting higher TVLs and higher market capitalization, Horizen, Phala and Dero still have to prove that they can build DeFi applications and other dApp use cases on the top of their networks.\n\nSecret and Oasis seem to have proven the capability to develop a number of use cases on their networks and consequently, they may be seen as lower risk investments. Their market capitalization was at the time of writing this report around $1 billion and if we continue to see the crypto space leaning towards privacy, these 2 protocols are in very good position to be serious contenders to lead the privacy space. This happening, we could see enough growth to put them on the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, which could probably represent a 10x growth from the current levels.\n\nWhat about Horizen, Phala and Dero? Their technology seems solid, but their dApp and DeFi ecosystem is not visible yet. They still need to prove to be able to attract developers, dApps and DeFi but in doing so, their growth potential could be even bigger.\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\n*The information contained in this document has been compiled by HashKey Group (as defined below)from sources believed to be reliable, but no representation or warranty express or implied is made by HashKey Group, its affiliates or any other person as to its fairness, reasonableness, reliability, accuracy, completeness or correctness.

Shopify, an online sales platform, has 52% of women users, is venturing into creating an NFT marketplace. WomenRise, a campaign is focussed on onboarding 100,000 women into the Web3 space, by the end of 2022.\n\n![Representational image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lFtnkFUjNBnAbRZMNMvjR.png?height=2154&width=3037)\n\n### The scene today\n\nAs recently as February 2022, a rising number of women have been making strides in the web3 space. One such collective, appropriately titled [BFF](https://www.mybff.com/), has made some noteworthy progress in the space. Only a few months old, the community has over more than 50,000 members in its space which includes some women celebrities including, Mila Kunis, Gwyneth Paltrow, Paris Hilton and Tyra Banks. \n\nAnother collective that has made some splash known as the, Black Women Blockchain Council, to onboard more black women into web3. This community has been around since 2018. Some others such as [WomenRise](https://womenrise.art/), [Boss Beauties](https://bossbeauties.com/), [Crypto Chicks](https://www.cryptochicks.app/) are also currently ruling the roost in the NFT space. To be honest, this is just the tip of the iceberg and a lot more needs to be done. \n\n![She is coming for you...stay on guard ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aiyTdWVHAnSbE-0UdG52W.png?height=4096&width=3067)\n\n### How do we get there? \n\nWe can’t iterate this enough but education is the stepping stone to everything. If we want real lifereal-life adoption, we have to understand that correct awareness is the prerequisite to that. Supporting and educating women, before aiming to onboard them into web3 is the chief requirement \n\nA few startups are already working towards that. One of the most notable ones include, Unstoppable Domains, that launched $10M Women of web3 initiative. To do so, they have tied up with nearly 65 initiatives to make this program a reality. \n\nAdditionally, our project, [Girl With Secrets](https://twitter.com/gwsofficialNFT) is working towards creating an ecosystem where women feel comfortable about seeking careers in crypto. We aim to create a program where women will be given the first preference when they seek out education and internship opportunities and our NFT collection has been curated to further that purpose. \n\n### Conclusion \n\nBuilding a thriving community with an equitable number of members from either gender can help women in particular be more participatory in emerging forms of tech. Additionally, creating a safe space for women to express their thoughts (contrary or otherwise) can go a long way towards creating meaningful discourse instead of a male-dominated echo chamber.  \n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n### How can you reach us?\n\n**Twitter**: @gwsofficialNFT\n\n**Discord**: [https://discord.gg/KHe9YyjDmz ](https://discord.gg/KHe9YyjDmz)\n\n**Instagram**:<https://www.instagram.com/gwsofficialnft/>\n\n**Telegram**: <https://t.me/+K89a-DsFOkY5ODY0>\n\n**Whatsapp**: <https://chat.whatsapp.com/GUCTg7VPOoNGXBh5S5Y5TK>\n\n**Facebook**: <https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100080914332795&sk=about>\n\n**Reddit**: <https://www.reddit.com/user/gwsofficialnft>\n\n**Quora**: <https://www.quora.com/profile/Marketing-GWS>\n\n**TikTok**: <https://www.tiktok.com/@gwsofficial.nft?lang=en>", "timestamp": 1653387205, "digest": "bHrW2wXVzkOO1Ko1191hK65tL0MkOgJUEkGOtthzUe8", "contributor": "0x6E2aE861d64d8E56E6438731b52920c9CBB430Cc"}

A headline used the term \"America\" as a synonym for the United States of America. \"That's incorrect,\" he said, sounding shocked that an esteemed publication would make such a junior mistake. \"America is a region, not a country.\"\n\nThough I didn't share his reaction, as a U.S. citizen living in Argentina I had quickly learned that it was in best taste to avoid referring to myself as an \"American\" or the U.S. as \"America.\" Such terminology almost always provoked my Argentinian acquaintances. \"We're all Americans,\" some would say gently, with a smile. In extreme cases I would receive a tirade denouncing U.S. arrogance. Largely, in Latin America and for Latin Americans, the term \"America\" means Latin America, and \"American,\" Latin American.\n\nModest ideas that can change the world.\n\nI was unaware of how nuanced \"America\" and \"American\" were before moving to Argentina in September 2010. I did have a moment of realization in college, though, that people outside the 50 United States also laid claim to the terms. It came when reading Cuban politician José Martí's seminal 1891 essay \"Nuestra América\" in a Spanish literature class. Martí urges the people of \"América\" to join together, strengthen the region and be proud of who they are and what is theirs--an echo of Simón Bolívar's tenets when crusading to unite the entire region in the early 1800s.

{"id": "lfrtu8OHXuEwNDjP7qyO88ZGqRnAHh_jltwOqye4_2w", "title": "Why Owning NFTs Will Be The Future of Your Identity ", "body": "By [Zachary Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyscott01/)\n\nIn the wake of what can only be described as a global NFT craze, I find myself wondering what more there is to the future of NFTs other than digital art…\n\n**Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and more specifically their smart contracts may prove to have a much deeper and more transformative impact than most casual observers would expect. There is a day on the horizon where NFTs will form the basis of our identities and reflect the characteristics of our individual personalities.**\n\nLooking beyond “material” possessions (and not material in the sense of tangible items as we all know that by definition NFTs are not quite this) but material in the sense of valuable digital art of which we have seen many amazing [examples](https://foundation.app/). 2021 was the year that NFTs became mainstream, but the more we learn the more we realise there is still a long way to go in the development of this technology with many real-world [use cases](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763) that will impact our everyday life, on the surface and within.\n\n**It's not about what you own but who you can become…**\n\n[Alex Danco](https://alexdanco.com/) does a truly fantastic job at describing this in Packy McCormick’s [Not Boring – Tokengated Commerce](https://www.notboring.co/p/tokengated-commerce?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0NjkxMjA4OSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NTMxNTkyODYsIl8iOiJSSnFQaCIsImlhdCI6MTY1MTUwMTYwMywiZXhwIjoxNjUxNTA1MjAzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTAwMjUiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.SUd1yV_bVySDF3oItpvsNG0eNLwdiqKdVxeo4ehH_pU&s=r) and I would highly recommend it for anyone wanting to dive a little deeper. Fundamentally, they discuss how crypto has always been about what you can do and NFTs, what you can own, but there is something more at play here and that is who you can become.\n\nOwnership of an NFT has often been associated with identity but this concept has the potential to play a much bigger role in our daily lives than just being a member of the latest cool trend. NFTs [represent](https://www.web3.university/tracks/build-your-first-nft) a new file format, our digital social identities are rapidly growing and for the first time this measure of culture and community can be neatly packaged in a way that can be just as easily interpreted by computers as it can be by people.\n\nWe humans are tribalistic beings, we long for belonging and to be a part of something. As owners of NFTs we will be people with [wallets](https://metamask.io/) and these wallets can be connected to discord channels, dapps and marketplaces as a means of communicating said identity. \"NFTs are a new token of meaning on the internet for 'fit in, and stand out', one of the most important raw ingredients for so many wonderful things in the world - culture, community, commerce\" says Alex who is working on what he refers to as Tokengated Commerce, taking this idea of signifying community membership and applying it to consumer experiences.\n\nIn the form of digital art NFTs are an output of commerce but following this they can evolve to be an input for commerce. Imagine shopping online but when you connect your wallet the retailer’s platform responds in a way that acknowledges you. This recognition has the power to be leveraged in a way that promotes inclusion far beyond any of the loyalty programs we see currently. The ‘gated’ aspect will gamify the experience to an extent as well, making certain products or real life experiences unlockable dependent on your identity, we have seen the beginning of this already with [Coachella](https://nft.coachella.com/bloom) utilising rare flower NFTs for specific area access, redemption mechanisms for products and other rare experiences.  In his [Three Stages of Adoption](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ftx_the-three-stages-of-nft-adoption-a-hypothesis-ugcPost-6925816246831603712-bjsB/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=android_app), FTX’s Trystan Yver describes how this idea of owning digital items that tie back to real life things in particular is how we will onboard the next wave of adopters. The combination of an increasingly personalised experience and one that plays to scarcity by limiting access and creating a challenge for consumers is one that will have a dramatic impact on everyone in the transition to [web3](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blockchain-coming-together-says-berners-200956278.html).\n\n![Source: 2022 In Bloom FTX NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZXGFl5jJLSiPwg9zxyzNC.png?height=632&width=744)\n\n**Identification and Verification**\n\nWhat makes NFTs so special is their ability to act as a digital identifier that can be controlled using the integrated smart contracts. This in particular is a benefit that can offer wide ranging practical use for individuals in every walk of life. Medical records and personal identification documents being the most obvious. Both of which are traditionally difficult to access and even harder to replace. Putting the control back into the hands of the individual as opposed to the large health institutions would increase confidentiality and allow the individual to dictate the specific information shared when seeking treatment without disclosing personal data that they wish to keep private.\n\nAnything that is unique can be represented digitally and secured to an NFT. Although the most common use for these special tokens has been in the mediums of digital rarities like artwork and collectibles, their ability to act as a digital representation for something could be extended to even us humans.\n\nAs adoption increases, we could occupy a world where an individual is issued an NFT birth certificate. Inextricably linked to the individual, this could be the start of establishing a digital record of identification and form the basis for which to link medical records that can be tracked in NFT form.\n\nA similar principle of identification can be applied to products within the manufacturing process. Take car manufacturing for example, by linking each individual part with a non fungible signature, which could be as simple as a QR code, the automotive supply chain would allow the manufacturer to trace the components in a way that in the event of a recall, could save the company billions if dollars each year by reducing the number of vehicles that would need to be recalled.\n\nWarehouse administration is another aspect of the supply chain that has the potential for radical increase in efficiency through the new standards blockchain enables. Inaccurate inventory can be costly for companies and we know all too well the scope for human error in conventional databases. By incorporating a digital identity that can move with the physical item we reduce the inventory related inaccuracies and increase the authenticity of the original, something that is becoming apparent in the luxury goods industry.\n\nLouis Vuitton [announced](https://www.euronews.com/culture/2022/02/19/fashion-and-blockchain-how-louis-vuitton-and-friends-are-digitising-your-threads) plans to use an NFT optimised supply chain to identify their goods and provide increased transparency throughout the products manufacturing process, adding to the uniqueness and quality. In the past five years we have seen a clear shift in sustainably focused firms and transparency has been a big driver in the promotion of this. As the luxury brands pave the way for what is possible, in the future we may see this authenticity flow down to some more accessible daily products such as clothing or coffee, where us consumers feel strongly about transparency in the entire supply chain process.\n\n![Source: Blockchain in Procurement and Supply Chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GjcUD4fEjtufdB9Oi6pM4.png?height=415&width=877)\n\nThe above are mere examples of things that can be easily integrated onto the blockchain via digital twins. Taking this concept of ownership verification there are a plethora of assets with historically clunky proof of ownership systems that we can apply this ideology to. Traditionally, conducting high value asset transactions digitally was uncommon. The process of buying a house can be a stressful experience for most lucky enough to experience it. Consisting of a long winded process with multiple parties involved in substantial paperwork facilitating the deed transfer. The smart contracts that underpin NFTs would allow this asset class and many others that have been notoriously illiquid, to be tokenised and traded as easily as you would trade a cryptocurrency.\n\nMarx Rowan, chief executive officer of Apollo Global Management Inc. said in an episode of “[Bloomberg Wealth with David Rubenstein](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-blockworks-group_apollo-ceo-500-billion-aum-on-the-potential-ugcPost-6929371971033956352-xkmL?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=android_app).” “Many of the rails or the technology or the platforms or the systems that support what’s happening in NFT are actually the precursor to changes in our financial system and we ignore them at our peril.”\n\nWork In Fintech's very own [Benyamin Ahmed](https://twitter.com/ObiWanBenoni), NFT [millionaire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abPmJwXan9c) at 12 years old and the youngest ever guest [lecturer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHUWaLcLau8) at Oxford University, will be talking more about digital identities and looking at how this generational shift will propel society further into the digital universe at [NFT.NYC](https://www.nft.nyc/).\n\nFollow [Work In Fintech](https://workinfintech.com/) for more information and to stay up to date as this new technology continues to shape our world.", "timestamp": 1653383367, "digest": "mQi4RkO97g8cqCnVunD_9kcBoskYxAx3ZC8YDS6ag44", "contributor": "0xcb1dad8Eb819F5E4AFD54284050aCE97Ca900464"}

In our previous piece we had briefly touched upon the topic about why women were reluctant to be a part of the tech, finance and other traditional so-called “'men only’ spaces,” there were a couple of points on how men were reluctant to do their part in making the space more inclusive.\n\nIn our [previous piece](https://mirror.xyz/0x6E2aE861d64d8E56E6438731b52920c9CBB430Cc/FDB1Ld7rZ1us7y1WVrt0_EZrtubf1TomixrsKk8-G98) we had briefly touched upon the topic about why women were reluctant to be a part of the tech, finance and other traditional so-called “'men only’ spaces,” there were a couple of points on how men were reluctant to do their part in making the space more inclusive. \n\n![Source: Cointelegraph](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gZ20wqxpr6I1KTzT6Wuv5.png?height=1117&width=1450)\n\nInterestingly, the ‘boys-only' trend is witnessing a gradual shift. Shopify, an online sales platform, has 52% of women users, is venturing into creating an NFT marketplace. WomenRise, a campaign is focussed on onboarding 100,000 women into the Web3 space, by the end of 2022.\n\n![Representational image](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lFtnkFUjNBnAbRZMNMvjR.png?height=2154&width=3037)\n\n### The scene today\n\nAs recently as February 2022, a rising number of women have been making strides in the web3 space. One such collective, appropriately titled [BFF](https://www.mybff.com/), has made some noteworthy progress in the space. Only a few months old, the community has over more than 50,000 members in its space which includes some women celebrities including, Mila Kunis, Gwyneth Paltrow, Paris Hilton and Tyra Banks. \n\nAnother collective that has made some splash known as the, Black Women Blockchain Council, to onboard more black women into web3. This community has been around since 2018. Some others such as [WomenRise](https://womenrise.art/), [Boss Beauties](https://bossbeauties.com/), [Crypto Chicks](https://www.cryptochicks.app/) are also currently ruling the roost in the NFT space. To be honest, this is just the tip of the iceberg and a lot more needs to be done. \n\n![She is coming for you...stay on guard ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aiyTdWVHAnSbE-0UdG52W.png?height=4096&width=3067)\n\n### How do we get there? \n\nWe can’t iterate this enough but education is the stepping stone to everything. If we want real lifereal-life adoption, we have to understand that correct awareness is the prerequisite to that. Supporting and educating women, before aiming to onboard them into web3 is the chief requirement \n\nA few startups are already working towards that. One of the most notable ones include, Unstoppable Domains, that launched $10M Women of web3 initiative. To do so, they have tied up with nearly 65 initiatives to make this program a reality. \n\nAdditionally, our project, [Girl With Secrets](https://twitter.com/gwsofficialNFT) is working towards creating an ecosystem where women feel comfortable about seeking careers in crypto. We aim to create a program where women will be given the first preference when they seek out education and internship opportunities and our NFT collection has been curated to further that purpose. \n\n### Conclusion \n\nBuilding a thriving community with an equitable number of members from either gender can help women in particular be more participatory in emerging forms of tech. Additionally, creating a safe space for women to express their thoughts (contrary or otherwise) can go a long way towards creating meaningful discourse instead of a male-dominated echo chamber.  \n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n### How can you reach us?\n\n**Twitter**: @gwsofficialNFT\n\n**Discord**: [https://discord.gg/KHe9YyjDmz ](https://discord.gg/KHe9YyjDmz)\n\n**Instagram**:<https://www.instagram.com/gwsofficialnft/>\n\n**Telegram**: <https://t.me/+K89a-DsFOkY5ODY0>\n\n**Whatsapp**: <https://chat.whatsapp.com/GUCTg7VPOoNGXBh5S5Y5TK>\n\n**Facebook**: <https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100080914332795&sk=about>\n\n**Reddit**: <https://www.reddit.com/user/gwsofficialnft>\n\n**Quora**: <https://www.quora.com/profile/Marketing-GWS>\n\n**TikTok**: <https://www.tiktok.com/@gwsofficial.nft?lang=en>", "timestamp": 1653387157, "digest": "bHrW2wXVzkOO1Ko1191hK65tL0MkOgJUEkGOtthzUe8", "contributor": "0x6E2aE861d64d8E56E6438731b52920c9CBB430Cc"}

{"id": "_RHA8uKzRwB2V6mBNvgrhQuFe-7NNXuGVD6HmtJFMDI", "title": "ETH升级学习笔记（一）", "body": "ETH的merge越来越临近，现在看来2022年应该能完成ETH的升级。\n\n## ETH为什么要升级？\n\n* 提高执行速度， 目前官方给出的标量是20TPS，就是每秒执行20个Transaction，\n\n  经过升级之后能够到达1000TPS\n* 提高安全性，目前的ETH 还是使用PoW(proof of work)方法来完成共识，升级之后降使用PoS（Proof of stake）的方法来进行共识。提高了整个网络的安全性，防止算力垄断的问题。\n\n更加环保可持续，PoW算法是通过用矿机的算力计算随机值，目前的技术算力越强，耗能越大，随着难度的提高，计算所用的时间也越长，而在使用PoS之后，就会大大节省了计算时间和功率，从而达到节能的目的。\n\n## 怎么做？\n\n目前分三步走\n\n1. 启动信标链 Beacon Chain\n2. 分片\n   * 主链合并到信标链 Merge，终止算力挖矿\n   * 启动分片链\n3. 执行层启动\n\n什么是信标链（beacon chain）？\n\n信标链相当于ETH2.0的心脏；\n\n分片链相当于四肢；\n\n执行层相当于大脑。\n\n**Beacon chain 为2.0提供心跳，从而让系统能够达成共识和和谐。**而为了要达到最终分片的目的（分片是一个大活），而分片的目的增加2.0的处理量。在分片内必须有校验者和执行者来分别对交易进行校验和执行。\n\n### Slot &Epoch\n\nSlot：每隔12秒，就是一个Slot\n\nEpoch：32个slot就是一个epoch，也就是6分24秒\n\n![Epoch0 中的32个slot，创始区块位于Slot0](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cu0kvqR76Fj5KxJCCSS3c.png?height=190&width=679)\n\nslot是可以产生区块的一个时间窗口，也可以没有。\n\nBeacon Chain和Shard Chain 是同步的。每12秒，一个beacon chain的区块和64个shard chain的区块会被产生出来。验证者需要大概的同步时间。一个Slot就像出区块的时间，出块时间也可以是空的，没有区块出来。\n\n在ETH2.0 的验证是PoS的虚拟的挖矿。验证者是积极的参与到eth2.0的，对于验证者，eth2.0有对应的激励和惩罚措施。\n\n一个区块的提议者是从验证者里，通过伪随机方式产生的。大部分时间时间，验证者是通过投票来对beacon block和shard block进行验证，投票决定了信标链的头和分片的头。\n\n### 质押验证者（Staking validators）\n\nValidators 是虚拟的，有Staker来激活产生。在ETH2.0中，用户通过质押ETH去激活和控制Validators。每个Validator需要投入最多32个ETH，但是staker可以stake他所有的ETH，这样每32ETH被stake就会有一个validator被激活。\n\nValidator是由信标链的节点的的客户端来执行的。信标节点具有跟踪和读取信标链的功能。 验证者客户端可以实现信标节点功能或调用信标节点。 一个验证器客户端可以执行一个或多个验证器。\n\n### 交叉联接（CrossLink）\n\n交联是信标块中对分片块的引用。 交联是信标链跟随分片链头部的方式。 由于有 64 个分片，每个信标块最多可以包含 64 个交联。 如果在这个Slot中，63 个分片没有提议的块，那么只会产生一个交联。 Eth2 Phase 1 计划使用交叉链接将分片链植根到信标链中，作为分片分叉选择、分片链终结性和跨分片通信的基础。 所有的分片链都始终跟随信标链。\n\n### 委员会（Committee）\n\n在每个 epoch 中，验证者被平均分配到 slot 中，然后细分为适当规模的委员会。 该slot中的所有验证者都证明了信标链的头部。 该slot中的每个委员会都尝试交叉链接特定的分片。 而洗牌算法会增加或减少每个Slot的委员会数量，以使每个委员会至少有 128 个验证者。\n\n举个例子\n\n假设有16384个验证者。 512个验证者被随机制定给了Slot1，剩下的512的验证者会指定给Slot2，以此类推。 第一个Slot的512个验证者会被分成4个委员会，随机制定给分片。假如分片33，55，22，11 被分片指定，所有的512个验证者会给Slot1 LMD GHOST 投票。128个验证者（4分之一的委员会成员）试图交联分片33，以此类推，每128个验证者都分别交联一个分片：55，22，11.\n\n对于slot2 也是如此。\n\n这个过程会一直持续下去，直至每个验证者都有一个slot，当轮到这个slot的时候，这个验证者可以广播，验证和交链。当这个epoch结束的时候，所有的验证者都有机会去验证和交联。到目前为止，验证者是基于slot而不是epoch进行投票的。就像对当地的政府进行投票，而不是在国家范围内进行投票。所有验证者没有基于同一个事物进行投票。下面在checkpoint和finality会描述epoch范围内的投票。\n\n### 信标链的Checkpoint\n\ncheckpoint是每个epoch中第一个slot的区块。如果这个slot没有区块，那么checkpoint就会前面最近的一个区块。每个epoch总会有一个checkpoint，一个区块可以是多个epoch的checkpoint。\n\n![在一个epoch包含有64个slot的状况下的checkpoint](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q836Qyq0CIodDsBn6XZaA.png?height=282&width=1024)\n\n上图中，slot65和slot128是空的，根据定义epoch2的checkpoint就是slot128，但是slot128没有，结果epoch2的checkpoint就是前一个block，位于slot64。epoch3的checkopoint也是同样，slot192是空的，所以由前一个block位于slot180的区块担任epoch3的checkpoint。\n\nepoch边界区块（Epoch boundary blocks）是一些文献中的术语，是checkpoint的同义词。\n\n当进行一个LMD GHOST的投票的时候，验证者也同样给位于当前的epoch的checkpoint进行投票。这个过程叫target。这个投票叫**Casper FFG vote**，该投票还包括以一个checkpoint，我们叫source。在上图中，位于epoch1的验证者对创世块的checkpoint进行投票（即source的checkpoint），还对target的checkpoint进行投票。 在Epoch2还是相同的验证者对相同的checkpoint进行投票。只有验证者被分配到了一个slot上才能对这个slot发起slot的LMD GHOST投票。但是，所有验证者都可以对每一个epoch的checkpoint发起FFG Vote。\n\n**绝对多数**\n\n所有活跃验证者的总余额的 2/3 投票被视为绝对多数。\n\n即\n\n*假设有三个活跃的验证者：两个有 8 ETH 的余额，一个唯一的验证者有 32 ETH 的余额。 绝对多数票必须包含唯一验证者的投票：虽然其他两个验证者可能对唯一验证者投票不同，但他们没有足够的余额来形成绝对多数。*\n\n### 确定性 Finality\n\n当一个epoch结束的时候这个epoch的checkpoint获得绝对多数的投票，那么这个checkpoint才是合理的。\n\n当checkpoint B是合理的，那么在下一个epoch中的checkpoint也是合理的，那么B才能被最终确认为合理的。通常一个checkpoint在2个epoch 12.8分钟内完成。\n\n平均下来，一个用户的交易，如果处于epoch中间，距离下一个checkpoint还有半个epoch那么这个交易最终确认是2.5个epoch，16分钟。\n\n理想情况下，一个epoch的第22个slot包含超过三分二的证明，因此，交易最终确定的平均时间为14分钟(16+32+22 个slot）。\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————\n\n*Reference*\n\n[https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/#validator-lifecycle](https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/#validator-lifecycle)\n\n[https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/beacon-chain/](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/beacon-chain/)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653386952, "digest": "JQ_5cCZP5MaYZ8aXvOOu4tRSBtQtrTYZgpVIkghJz98", "contributor": "0xa5ce57f4F59a7E80996866071f3eB1025D09e4fA"}

Metaverse already become a hot topic. We have seen many mainstream metaverses, such as Sandbox, Decentraland, Crypo voxel, world of web3. Can any speaker here share your opinion about how you understand the metaverse?\n\n### Vivi:\n\nI think Metaverse is really a very interesting topic. It is very close to the concept of Web 3, which in my understanding is about ownership sovereignty and freedom. We all heard about the concept from the book Snowcrash By Neal Stephenson. Everybody was talking about it. That was back in 1992, so for many years. The Metaverse seems like just another name of the evolution of the Internet. We could be more social, but actually more immersive. A16Z recently published a report that I think really makes a lot of sense. It says that broadly speaking, there are 2 competing versions of the Metaverse. One is a decentralized Metaverse with Property rights and new boundaries that interoperable open and owned by the community that builds and maintains it. That is more close to the web3 as I see it. Another Version is a centralized and closed Metaverse basically an extended version of Web 2 like elaine mentioned. Facebook changed its name to Meta. This is still like the same idea with all the platforms take most of the profit. So now which version do you support right? The open decentralized version is owners owning our own data and property right. But obviously, it’s like Shakespeare. so everybody has their own version of the Metaverse, but I think the the Metaverse combined with web 3, should give us open sources, decentralization and let us users owning our own data. We have the data ownership and sovereignty.\n\n### Jademont:\n\nI think Metaverse is a combination of multiple technologies, such as AI, Blockchain, cloud computing and big data. It attracted so much attention because everyone actually can jump in and find their own position in Metaverse no matter you are an investor, a programmer or an artist. I’m expecting not only a virtual word that people can spend their time and play, but also a new lifestyle that is in parallel with the current world where there’s no race, no country and everyone is his own Avater. One can only leave less than 100 year in real life, but can actually live forever in networks.\n\n## Q2: As we all know Metaverse is not unique to web3. Traditional web3 Internet giants such as Facebook ,Baidu are also deploying the web2 Metaverse. What’s the difference between these different Metaverse products? Which one is more promising in the future?\n\n### Andrew Fai：\n\nI have been increasingly worried about Facebook stands on Metaverse. I have a feeling that Facebook may hijack the definition. There is a lack of transparency happening with how Facebook uses users’ data. Nowadays, a lot of these hyper targeted ads are digging into your WhatsApp text messages, your Facebook Messenger, and digging into all your browsing history. I think this level of privacy is not really addressed on Facebook. This just makes me increasingly worried about how much they would know about me as I participate in their Mark Zuckerberg’s version of Metaverse. So I think there will be a competing narrative across like the Giants or Facebook, creating their own version of Metaverse.\n\n### Elijah:\n\nI think people will eventually realize the importance of their own data. Musk purchased Twitter and he says that he will be open sourcing the news feed algorithm. How user data will be collected overtime. That is a really big important moment in history, where for the first time people start understanding how much data these big web2 companies are collecting from them and they need to do something about it. And when that awareness start to arise, I think people are starting to leave. They will start to migrate from Facebooks, Instagrams or other web2 companies that are just stealing users’ data. They will embrace the new web 3 Metaverse that we’re seeing today. I believe it is mainstream.\n\n### Vivi:\n\nWe have faith that open and decentralized version of Metaverse will eventually take over. But it does take time for everything. To be honest, it’s really difficult to or it takes time to educate people, for example, to open a wallet and to really embrace that decentralized app. You know the applications that still struggling to catch up with the web 2 style kind of user experience. It takes time for infrastructure in web3 to develop and mature.\n\n## Q3: Under the background of the current bear market, how do you think the future floor price trend of these metaverse land and nft projects will develop?\n\n### Elijah:\n\nI choose to treat the MFT market as a consumer. So I’ve purchased rather than do a kind of speculative investment and I can relate to that that position. It’s essentially taking something that has no intrinsic value and creating its value through the network social capital. In the old Gallery system, this was essentially which group show you a part of which kind of creator put on your show. Which level of gallery represented you. Each gatekeeper came with a certain level of social capital and that created the value via consensus mechanism for the object in this case. The painting the photograph the sculpture, etc. And and I see the same thing unfolding with NFTS and that’s not necessarily a bad thing at all. Institutions and Instinctive organizations of society are based around.\n\n### Elaine：\n\nAs we know that nowadays there are many so many Metaverse Products. Users cannot enter into different Metaverse easily. so I think it is it possible that a future infrastructure can provide solution to build a Metaverse Bridge between different networks.\n\n### Jademont:\n\nI think Crosschain Metaverse is very necessary in the future. We can just imagine actually every Metaverse in future is just like a planet in the universe. There are isolated when the technology is not very developed, but one day they will communicate with each other by spaceship or other kind of technology. However, It’s a double edged sword. The traffic and wealth of one Metaverse will migrate from one to the other one which is more popular. I think for each Metaverse, you have to increase your own competitive power before you really make the crosschain Metaverse work. This is what we want to remind all of those founders of different networks.\n\n### CAT:\n\nOne thing I really concern is about the underlying engine. We see the Sandbox or the decentraland and or other new Metaverse. Every Metaverse was used different engine to develop. Even we use some bridge, as the underlying code so differential, people can not easily switch. So we need to develop some new infrastructure like the developer engine because there are so many underlying software.\n\n## Q4: Yugalabs provides sdk for other NFT projects, and are there any solutions which can help these 2d pfp nft projects change into 3d NFT and enter the metaverse?\n\n### CAT:\n\nSo the basically the first thing Yugalabs needs to do is to build the model. of the 2D-NfT. 2D-NFT projects need to cooperate with other brands to help them to turn 2D NFT into the 3D model and actually. We’re working on this value feature right now my project. Actually,we’re working on this feature right now. My project CAT is developing an avatar like platform. We made a 3D models for some corporative 2D projects so the NFT holders can directly use this kind of model to experience Yugalabs or something else.\n\n## Q5:Many web2 brands such as LV,NIKE ,ADIDAS are rapidly entering the web3 metaverse to build their own digital brands. What kind of services as an infrastructure can we provide for brands?\n\n### Igor Samaradziski :\n\nIt really does come to the utility. It boils down to the liquidity of viewership and popularity. So some of the really nice user cases we had recently were exposure of the designers that quite literally working from home. They map their clothes in 3D styles and create virtual fashion words, virtual fashion shows, which allow bigger brands to pick up and utilize those designs. Similarly, if you take a look at Adidas release in the early days. Who are releasing sneaker designs? How popular a certain design of NFT is depends on how many times it has been traded before the designer decide whether they want to actually produce that sneaker in life. It’s usually the product that is delivered to consumers that enjoy using it. As that liquidity builds up, we’ll see more and more brands utilizing this digital space to bridge their real real world applications.\n\n## Q6: in web3 world, DID become very popular, it’s kind of onchain social identity, what do you think about DID paradigm or new business model?\n\n### Jademont:\n\nI think it is a very promising technology for the Metaverse implementation. Instead of using a wallet address that is very long and hard to remember, people tend to use our short name like ENS, image avatar to represent their identities in Web3. This is one simple understanding for DID. A key point of DID is how people organize or even devices can be identified and located without centralized system of Identifiers. Metaverse is still evolving. It’s just the very beginning. At the first step, DID is designed for people like you and me. This is what most of the entrepreneurs that the founders are aiming for. In the future, I think DID is for everything, not only for Human being, but also devices like a machine or even cars. We have invested one project. They gives the electricity charger and DID to represent one robot. This device has a wallet , a Ethereum or pocket wallet. They can gain money from what they have done to the people. This is very interesting and I’m very excited to see what will happen. In this area, I think DID in Metaverse is a very interesting combination.\n\n### CAT：\n\nI just open my mind about the DID and another things because he mentioned that we also can just put the ID on other product or cars or something else. I believe it will be a hugedevelopment of the IOT industry because now we see the application of the web3 is just the customer application. Till now we don’t see any of the application on the factory and some other to B model so. I believe it will be a very bright future.\n\n### Jademont:\n\nIndeed, the idea is unnecessary factor for IOT plus blockchain or plus metaverse. The Technology development for the final metaverse is that there’s no difference between human being and the devices. That’s the ideal world for cyber punk. In the world you cannot tell the difference between a human being or robot because all behind is the DID.\n\n## Q7: from investors’ view, what are the new trends in Metaverse NFTs? what do you see the market go from here?\n\n### Jademont:\n\nActually we are looking for 2 kinds of projects. The first one is infrastructure, so that will make the blockchain adoption cheaper, faster and easier. For example, the NFT oriented public chains. The second kind of project. We are looking for is for products who are able to bring traffic to their applications.\n\n### Elaine:\n\nfirst trend i think is that metaverse and nft market will combine with socialfi, so this year, we have seen like like StepN，create a new model like X to earn ,it combined with a good socialfi , which turned out to be a successful Web3 product , nowadays metaverse are very single and individual, we would like to see a multi chain Bridge to link different metaverses together. So we would like to see more infrastructure to provide this kind of solution, They will bring their traffic to different and second trend i think is second time creation, nowadays we have seen some product combined with VR and AR echnique, so they can help artist to do the second time creation, so which would help the users to Show off their own NFTS, for example, if I am byc Holder. So I can use your product to do our second creation, and to share with my like social media, which is cool. And third trend I think is incubation platform like IDO platform for example, we have seen Outland JRLAND ,incubated and onboard many famous artists, such as fanglijun, their nft price perform very well ,so I would like to see more like this kind of incubation platform onboard with many a good artist.\n\n## Q8:Can you give some good advice on how to survive in the bear market?\n\n### Jademont:\n\nWell, I’m familiar with this question because I have gone three recycles since 2013. I’m an optimist. I think current situation is much better than 2018, the last bear market. At that time product teams were doing the fund raising Ethereum and then the bear market came. They cannot afford the salary of their team members. That was horrible. and wait for the next bull market. But for now, we’re doing fundraising using USDT, the stable coin. It doesn’t affect their stability of the team at least. So they have enough patience to develop their products and wait for the next bull market. So I think for developers and founders of the team members of one project, you just need to ignore all the noises in bear market and make your product get launched as soon as possible and build your community.\n\n### Andrew：\n\nI think that our first of all you need to budget yourself in terms of your available resources and exposure to risk to this market and second of all like. Need to have a very fine line between investing and gambling . These 2 are very different. Testing requires you to do very deep earth research. I will also consult experts to reach a well thought out decision entering the market, while gambling is just gathering enough data and just just. Just taking a bet, you know, so it got all you make a very big distinction between the 2 what I would say is like if you if you’re currently under the water or really suffering right now.\n\n### C.A.T:\n\nFor startup, we’re trying to do our best to go through the bear market.There are 2 things we try our best to serve. We will use the time to develop my product,add some more utility and to do some more color collaboration with it, too, just to build a great good product.", "timestamp": 1653383486, "digest": "oNC6JNSTUlgFJV7YfAlWuFpEH-Zw1fUSJqzGn_coyos", "contributor": "0x123bfD9040A61eC24feeaFf77FC22A6819320ee2"}

"为了完成兔子洞任务，从知乎上搬了一篇长文过来，这篇文章在知乎上发表于2021年11月21日，是对自己自入职阿里之后半年在币圈的经历与总结。\n\n半年前我在知乎上发布了一篇万字长文[《最近三年复盘总结》](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/357021961)，其初心在于如果未来某一天我不幸再次陷入困境希望能够通过这篇文章重现和回味过去三年的点点滴滴，或许能够给我一些启发让我能够有勇气一如既往的坚持下去，同时也警醒自己如果有一天自己辉煌了，有点儿成就了切不可辜负当初那个不离不弃愿意陪我一起努力的另一半。时间不知不觉又过去了半年，这期间其实还是发生了蛮多事情的，还是习惯于根据时间线把自己的经历做个记录与复盘。 \n  \n 在知乎上发完万字长文的次日也就是3.15下午新入职了现在所在的公司，开始一段时间里还是有些不适应和紧迫感的。次日（3.16）下午通过老杨渠道花900块购买的菲律宾CoinList账号到货，跟着老杨的贴心傻瓜式教程很快修改了登录密码、邮箱和谷歌2FA认证，准备参与月底的Casper打新认购。等到认购的那天（3.26）早上我在去医院的路上用手机自带浏览器佛系的用唯一一个菲律宾账号登录并尝试排队，竟然幸运的排到了（由于是第一次参与打新不知道打中还留有几天的付款时间，看到我提前充值进去用于认购的BTC跌到价值不足5000U，以防万一就只认购了4975U）。在此期间我还在陆陆续续的降低自己的负债和币圈投入成本，月底最后一天（3.31）为期一年的工行融e借到期连本带息一把结清，至此从2015年10月7日开始伴随了我五年多之久的各种贷款（房贷除外）正式全部结清，信用卡额度回填到只剩1w左右的账单分期。新公司没有了PC端微信许多消息都严重滞后很多时候都是晚上下班后才统一查看，因此3月份后半个月我在币圈的精力投入不多。 \n  \n 四月份币圈迎来了一波上涨的热潮，BTC冲破6w美金带领一众山寨垃圾币群魔乱舞～印象比较深刻的是4.13-4.16我飞去杭州参加为期三天的“精武门”线下培训（这里有个小插曲：月初（4.7）时候收到了来自媳妇儿的一份名为《强哥请回答》的灵魂拷问，为了日后能够交出一份相对满意的答复思虑再三后于4.15在杭期间提前还了20w房贷），期间BTC一度涨到6.4w美金一枚。韭菜终究是韭菜，作为韭菜的我那个时候才觉得是时候建仓一些BTC了，而且在培训结束当天准备返程去机场的时候寻思把建仓的1.27个BTC从币安转回火币，很玄学的走了币安的ERC20通道（后来才明白原来那是个坑，可见我之前是真的不持有BTC的）。后来我发现BTC成功的被我压住了上涨的势头开始拐头向下，直到有一天我看到BTC大跌十来个点，我直接在5.6w挂单梭了2枚，心想有DOGE、SHIB等一众一天数倍的山寨币吸引韭菜，怎么着也不至于继续下跌吧。嗯，是啊，果然没过多久BTC重回6w，这么轻松就赚了8000U吗简直有些不敢相信～快到月底的时候突然一条名为Solana的新公链出现在了我的世界，当时有个MEDIA的打新活动在Solana的一个Swap平台Raydium做IDO，由于这是该平台上的第一个IDO项目给了一轮社区轮（一种没有门槛人人可参与不设上线均分的模式），于是我就手工创建了20个账号梭了9000U（单账户上限为450U）去参与，结果收益果然可观。看到这边的赚钱效应后又了解到它还配套有个中心化交易所（FTX），抽了一个周末的时间注册并实名认证了，当时在微信里搜关键字FTX发现很多有关于它的聊天记录都是积极且看好的，心里有种想梭哈的冲动可这几年的吃亏经历彷佛有另一种声音在提醒我该冷静～过了几天发现微信群里天天传三件套又疯了，终于我再也忍不住想要梭哈了，可当时我已经处于满仓状态且大仓位在MDX（大约8w个），而MDX有个弊端在于没有抵押属性，所以就找了个机会趁MDX还在相对高位的时候换了BTC，然后在LendHub抵押BTC借了10wU去梭哈（这种梭哈真的就是无脑一个挂单直接成交的那种）Solana上的三件套（SOL、SRM、RAY）。为了分散风险当时我的仓位分配是这样的：SOL和SRM各3wU，RAY因为质押可以参加IDO打新所以多些4wU，果然短短几天10wU杠杆梭得三件套就变成了价值13wU，可惜当时完全没有意识到风险正逐渐逼近，现在回头看那应该是我撤出的最佳窗口期了。 \n  \n 五一假期我回了老家，为了把我媳妇儿慢慢带入区块链的世界，我特意远程给她分了个小任务，我给她提供SOL和RAY，让她帮忙创建40个SOL钱包账户，然后分固定数量的SOL做燃料，再分固定数量的RAY到每个账户做质押，回京后不久Raydium就发公告于5.19启动第二个IDO项目MER（当时心里还在窃喜这波肯定得涨疯了）。与此同时3月底认购的Casper即将发币（5.11），OK、火币、Gate等一二线交易所也纷纷分布第一时间上币交易的公告，即将发币那晚当我看到交易所的价格顿时觉得可能本轮100wU的目标要达成了，总量100亿个一开盘直接冲到66U一个什么概念，这直接一下子打开了我的“格局”，然而随着CoinList的发币价格顿时雪崩，眼瞅着100wU的预期直接跌至100w人民币身为韭菜的我怎能甘心～我不甘心，我开始寻找机会抄底，仍然娴熟的从LendHub杠杆借了3wU出来在gate以0.88u的价格梭了3wU，果然不到一天的时间就反弹至1.22u，也就是那一天我的币圈儿自有资金 + 杠杆收益浮盈达到了本轮的巅峰。5.17晚我再次飞去杭州准备参加5.18公司举办的“哈希之星”培训，记得那晚老杨还在钉钉搞直播如何管理多台服务器以及各种云服务器的开通以防止CoinList被封号，那时候的CSPR杠杆部分已经跌至0.55把我深套了，下飞机后我在一个群里看到有人在出售CSPR第一轮单价0.11u，我直接说我收了。就这样等我赶到亲橙客栈进房间第一件事儿就是从LendHub借了7333U找了墨客做中介收购了一个CSPR的第一轮，当时觉得自己占了挺大的便宜开心的还给墨客发了100元微信红包。高兴之余看着LendHub账户里的借贷比例逐渐升高不免有一丝隐隐的不安，寻思着等培训结束回京后找个机会把杠杆稍微降降...然而人算不如天算，5.19当我中午12点从大兴机场落地后打开火币发现整个币圈都崩了，此时杠杆部分SOL三件套已经从盈利转为亏损，杠杆部分CSPR当初以为的抄底变成了抄顶，抵押物BTC自己一个一天跌没了1wU，感觉整个人脑瓜子嗡嗡的。想到当天晚上要参加Raydium的IDO算是个慰藉希望能够弥补一点儿损失，然而参加IDO的那点收益相较于币价自身的跌幅简直就是杯水车薪，有意思的是随后的几天时间里三件套中的SOL无视大盘崩盘，竟然出现了逆势拉盘之景象，短短几天SOL自身的跌幅就全部收回且往上拉了一些，我乘势将45U成本的SOL 以48U出手收回3wU成本还掉了一部分杠杆（盈利部分就是之前创建账号分掉的燃料）；剩下的SRM和RAY还继续拿着希望可以像SOL一样逆势拉盘让我回本，可事实是随着动物园memo的崩盘大盘止不住的断崖式下跌，终于SRM和RAY在大盘的带领下也开始了报复性的狂跌，距离回本越来越遥远。与此同时CSPR的跌幅和跌速也是相当之迅猛，一天跌40个点很轻松，从CoinList参与打新到拿3wU杠杆“抄底”到杠杆借U买第一轮锁仓中签号让我在这个币上面无路可退，只能继续杠杆借U来进行我所谓的抄底。浑浑噩噩的五月下半旬在暴跌中度过，这波小半个月的暴跌让我本来全仓的抵押物BTC单价直接从近6wU跌至不到4wU，币圈的风向标的尚且如此，其它的土狗山寨直接腰斩...与此同时我的收益也大幅度缩水（一方面抵押物BTC缩水三分之一，另一方面杠杆借U买的其它币种腰斩被动亏损），感觉挺对不住家人的于是在5.31提前还了12w房贷。 \n  \n 时间来到六月份想着行情能够稍微好转，但没想到政策性利空一波接着一波，整体大趋势还是一直往下。那时候我爸的眼睛由于免疫力下降引起了角膜发炎，想到自己每天上下班去地铁的路上就路过一个以“中国”冠名的眼科医院，就趁着端午假期（6.12）回家将爸妈一并都接来了北京（6.13）。工作日的时候我媳妇儿带着爸妈去医院挂号看眼睛，我就周末的时候陪我爸去复查，爸妈在的这段时间里带他们去了中山公园、天安门看降旗、步行长安街、坐二层公交赏夜景、去我上班的公司楼下打卡、打车经过长安街回家、深夜在小区馆子里吃饭...期间虽然我每晚加班回家他们早已经睡了，但第二天我上班前总是可以吃得上我妈做的家乡饭，而且还可以借此机会用家乡话跟爸妈唠家长里短...周末（6.20）白天媳妇儿去上班没在家，我给爸妈看了我们结婚时候拍的实体婚纱照相册，还用笔记本投屏到电视机给他们看我们两年前的结婚录像，我也借此机会重温了一遍当初在台上许下的承诺和誓言。一路走来爸妈也知道我结婚当时的一个真实处境，为了让他们替我少操些心，就跟他们说了说我现在的一个大概情况（外面的各种银行贷款已经全部结清、信用卡透支部分已全部结清、房贷已提前结清32w还剩80w、他们所担心的高风险理财中还有本金30w）。爸妈听完后长长的舒了一口气（我深深知道这几年来他们是怎么样战战兢兢的替我捏一把汗过来的）明显感觉到他们发自内心的替我感到欣慰（这可能是这个世上唯一真正发自内心和肺腑原滋原味不带任何目的性希望我好的人了）。爸妈跟我说那几年我过的那么的捉襟见肘狼狈不堪（我每次回家包里带POS机在村里来回倒腾信用卡他们是知道的）他们最担心的就是有一天我会走上违法犯罪的道路，那时候我回家他们念叨最多的一句就是不管糟糕到哪种地步都不要去触碰法律的底线，法不容情～最后，他们也给了我比较传统且保守的建议：找个机会能撤的话把那30w本金也撤出来赶紧把房贷还了，以后自己就不用再那么大压力了。我听了之后连连点头，联想到最近一个月收益大幅回撤上百万内心除了愧疚更有不甘。恰逢那天是父亲节，两天后（6.22）是我爸的生日就择日不如撞日地订了个蛋糕趁我休息在家提前庆祝下，我妈炒了几个简单的家常菜等媳妇儿到家后一起开开心心的围着紧凑的小饭桌吃了顿饭。再回到行情我爸生日那天（6.22）晚上我还在公司加班，突然间有个同事跑到我身边的那个高P公司级理财顾问身边借钱说币圈又崩了要进场抄底，我打开交易所一看直接懵逼...BTC跌破3wU关口，那一瞬间我的信仰彻底崩塌，那一刻我想的不再是去加保证金防止爆仓，而是直接上去又借了5wU套现离场，至此我在币圈投入的本金因为两次大的暴跌全部撤了出来，至于持仓我已经不敢再去看了，心想着要跌就跌吧，大不了爆仓反正又没有自己的本金在里面，如果爆仓归零就再择机重来，反正要我再追加资金去保住抵押物是不可能了（因为我深有体会如果是在下行趋势中要暴跌，加保证金的速度远远抵不过下跌的速度）。就这样爸妈在我这儿住了两周心心念念的说放不下村里菜园子种的各种菜要回家，我这边也收到通知要让回去交契税（预示着房子大红本快下来了），就帮他们订了票并送上回家的火车。最终也听取了他们保守的建议于6.26再次提前还了30w房贷。 \n  \n 如果说六月份是一场以BTC为首大地震，那么七月份应该是这场大地震带给各路山寨主流币的一系列余震。先来说说CSPR，这个币他妈的真鸡儿神了，从上线66U一路跌到六月底0.19U感觉还不过瘾，七月伊始，开始了下跌加速度，凭借几根大红柱子仅用了不到半个月就跌了近75%（0.05U），SRM和RAY就更不用说了，腰斩再腰斩最低跌到一个不到3U。这下舒服了，回头往前看发现我死扛的这俩月任何一个时间节点下车都是对的。此时的我持仓情况是这样的：现货BTC满仓大约10个，剩下的CSPR有几万U是我的本金，其它的SRM、RAY、CSPR都是抵押BTC借的USDT加的杠杆。再看看自己在LendHub的负债有近18wU（RAY部分4wU，SRM部分3wU，最后一波撤本金出来5wU，剩下的都在CSPR上，折合人民币100w出头），看了下质押率还算相对安全，但也开始为肉眼可见的利息的增长速度感到焦虑。由于格局和认知所限，过了几天开始渐渐有了去杠杆的念头，恰在此时微信群里开始疯传一条关于宝二爷喊牛市结束熊市已然到来的长达两个多小时的视频，也正是这时常可以媲美一部电影的视频将我成功洗脑，再结合当下自己每月3000+ USDT的利息支出，感觉死扛不是长久之计，最终在内心深处同意了熊市开始的观点并决定去扛杆。那么问题来了，我是应该把这死扛的RAY和SRM清掉还是把一路“抄底”的CSPR清掉还杠杆借的U，然后再卖BTC来补这窟窿？我看了下自己统计和追踪的表格数据之后还是决定全部由BTC来买单，理由和想法是这样的：我的RAY和SRM持仓成本分别在13U和12U左右，CSPR一路从0.88U开始抄底直至0.055U自有资金加杠杆部分已经将成本拉低指0.25U，很巧的是三者算下来跌幅基本都在80%左右，而BTC哪怕从最高点下来跌幅也才不到50%，按照韭菜思维肯定是优先割跌幅小的啊（其实也有一丝丝对冲的想法：如果真如宝二爷所言熊市来临，那理论上肯定是清山寨和垃圾留BTC，可万一后市还有最后一波高潮，我理解跌幅80%的山寨反弹力度较跌幅50%的反弹力度应该大些。基于这样的思考我选择卖BTC去杠杆，其它的山寨和垃圾币留着赌后市的反弹）。就这样将杠杆全部去掉后清点了下剩下的那点儿资产，净利润已经从五月份的高点缩水了近三分之二，没过几天临近月底时候难产链OEC终于出来了，一夜之间彷佛牛市又回来的感觉憋了那么久的各项目方都蠢蠢欲动争先恐后的第一时间上线项目。而我此时手里除了割不下手的山寨和垃圾币就剩BTC，于是就在3.8wU附近出了一些BTC筹集了11.52wU，跟媳妇儿说了我的这一系列骚操作后给我好好数落了一番，最后达成一致协议：把我手里剩下的那点儿少的可怜的BTC全部交给她来保管，其中一部分按照当前市场价折价一部分抵扣我欠她的18w债务，多余的也一并交由她代为保管，期限长度要么达10wU一个要么以年为单位直接到下一轮牛市。 \n  \n 就这样在死扛了两个多月后终于在现实面前选择了妥协割肉去杠杆，八月第一天我便履行协议将我剩下的那点儿BTC从交易所全部提到了教我媳妇儿创建的BTC钱包中。此刻的我终于舒了一口气，一方面债务表中可以划掉一笔18w的内部债务，另一方面也断了我卖BTC的念想，手里除了那被套牢的山寨和垃圾币就只剩11.52wU。没有了后顾之忧接下来就拿着11.52wU重新开始入场梭哈，一看群消息热点全在OEC上，就直接一口气把所有的USDT都通过交易所跨到OEC上。进场之后首先去朋友圈宣传比较久的JSwap上体验了下交易挖矿，简单算了下确实把交易的手续费基本都通过JF的形式返还了，觉得还不错就在0.3u附近直接梭了1w多u，当天下午就最高冲到0.85u，可惜等跟同事吃了个饭完事儿就已经回落跌到0.6u，这时候隔壁的樱桃已经开始上第一个IFO了，代币CHE也从零点几直接冲到5U多，此刻我再也按耐不住那颗想要快速赚钱的心便直接以0.57u左右的价格把JF一把砸了用利润梭哈了0.3枚BTC。来到樱桃看了一圈儿挖矿高回报率的矿池基本没有白嫖，都需要CHE才可以参与（让我联想到了上半年HECO上的HBO），刚刚完事儿的第一个IFO项目考拉（KOA）也在樱桃上开了矿池收益率贼高，此时OEC的火热已经把OKT也短短几天搞翻倍破百了，那晚加班回来的地铁上看到大家热火朝天的讨论各种项目，直接梭哈进场（OKT作为OEC的燃料占大头直接梭了5wU成本110U，CHE作为樱桃参与高收益矿池和IFO的门票直接梭了3wU成本4.66U，KOA作为第一个拉盘的IFO项目且可以挖CHE直接梭了3wU成本2.16U），有了这些代币之后发现CHE可以放进单币池无损挖矿，但KOA想要高收益挖CHE则必须配USDT做LP流动性，于是我又熟练的想到了借贷。这时候一个新的借贷平台supremeX正好上线，我第一时间把价值5wU的OKT全部充值进去抵押，搞笑的一幕来了，这项目方不知道咋回事儿合约写的有问题冲进去的资产死活赎不出来，当时我的那个脑瓜子嗡嗡的，心想这玩意儿要是真跑了可咋弄...就这么眼睁睁的等了一天多，一边关注电报群消息，终于到次日晚上成功通过界面将充值的OKT全部赎回，接着赶紧完成取消授权将该平台从OEC项目书签列表中删除并将奖励的代币一把砸完关掉网页等一系列连环动作。然而此时的OKT已经经历了从买入的110U涨至124U又跌至100U的尴尬局面，不幸的是我梭的这三个币似乎是联动的且跌起来是一个比一个狠，很快这三个币都将我成功套住，挖矿的那点儿收益根本无法覆盖币价下跌的速度。于是我静下心来回想我的这一系列操作发现我之所以快速入局并被套究其根本原因在于太急于要赚到钱，那么我现在要做的便是放下赚钱的执念，好好想想如何解套回本。就这样我开始了自救之路，首先从有利好时间窗口的考拉（KOA）开始，因为它距离应用正式上线还有几天时间，那么这算是一个潜在利好再加上暂时有高收益的挖矿加持，后面应该会拉一波而那个时候是我唯一的机会。就这样我放弃了抵押OKT去借USDT的想法，而是将一半的OKT直接在樱桃上兑换成了KOA（虽然二者都有跌幅，但KOA跌幅远大于OKT，因此拿OKT换KOA还是相对属于抄底拉低成本），然后用剩下的一半OKT和那0.3枚BTC抵押借USDT出来跟KOA搭配做流动性挖矿，挖出来的CHE继续换KOA（CHE的跌幅也相对小于KOA）复投，就这样在KOA要迁移流动性至其官网当天一把砸完不仅收回了KOA 3wU成本和OKT一半成本2.5wU，还赚了2000多u；接着樱桃来了第二个IFO项目HMD，这个项目我用回本的USDT和CHE做流动性去参与了，结果收益跟我想象的差不多相对一般，但是我冒险做了一件事儿：在IFO结束的时候大家都忙着去领HMD砸盘，我却反其道而行之直接解了CHE和USDT的LP，将CHE一把砸完。果然很快大家看到HMD被砸就开始砸CHE，这时我又一把将CHE接回来，经过这个比较冒险且激进的波段把成本直接降低了好几个点。接下来为了资金利用率最大化，就拿剩余的OKT跟CHE组LP去挖矿，已经回本的USDT踏踏实实的放单币池中去挖（能挖几个算几个），后来渐渐的大盘开始回升BTC突破4w，而OKT也借此机会又重新涨回了100U一个，相较于110U成本算了下亏损有限就趁机砸完并把亏损的成本全算在CHE身上，至此当初跨至OEC的11.52wU除了被樱桃套住的3wU其它都回本了。不久项目方又创新的出了个什么锁仓的功能代币叫HDT，该功能一旦将币锁住则在到期之前任何情况均无法解锁，相当于直接把币自身的流动性完全锁死，有点儿奇葩的是在币锁定期间没有任何收益且要参与还必须以HDT的方式付出手续费。总之该功能唯一的目的就是帮忙拿住币，可话说回来如果只是这功能的话我直接交给我媳妇儿保管不就完了吗，好在该币总共2100w个除100w个用于初始流动性做市外其它2000w个全部免费空投CHE的持有者，8.19空投通过IFO的形式发放完成后项目方用100w个HDT以0.1u的初始价格配了10wU添加流动性，结果被CHE大户跟一帮善于波段的小散户们一顿乱砸，直接把项目方给割了...而我却觉得这反而是我樱桃回本的好机会，于是在暴跌的过程中直接将我的所有樱桃陆续都换成了HDT并把亏损的成本全部算在HDT身上。电报群里的樱桃管理员说官方已经在大家砸盘的过程中已经悄悄回购了100w枚HDT，于是我就去链上扒哪些地址进行了多频次大手笔的回购，确实找到了官方用于回购的8个地址，于是接下来的半个多月便每天跟踪这些地址的动向，发现每次大跌的时候这些地址都会出手回购，到HDT锁仓功能上线时官方回购的地址代币情况是这样的： \n 0xd4AD9fa470ba182A57943b99BD1A818E7AC65cEB 801900.4735枚、 \n 0xca55F112Ca23f1e234115B7c2E6ACb0fe8b0F7c1 416000.4637枚、 \n 0x671806A56eAD47DE26d8E0FD9c68ac2EB4F38D42 381720枚、 \n 0x9BEFe8e3D54b0328bbc396d732c9cc4220add3c6 318920.1715枚、 \n 0xDc515EC8799246d07Bb6B223bb1d44c2c9c54bAa 299990枚、 \n 0x451E0edfCA1D628Da01bd6B7898C38943F62989d 299990枚、 \n 0x2E63759e9423a8FE1F69C10e5276E4944a8dc139 299990枚、 \n 0xA1BDa98926584F7d84Ace3414aD8A388c86AB652 122000.9682枚 \n 累计以均价大约0.06u的价格回购了2940512.0769枚，而且项目方做了两件事儿：一是将自己初始做市的流动性LP全部用他们自己的创新性锁仓功能锁了半年；二是将他们上面八个账号中回购的的HDT也全部都通过单币种锁仓功能进行了锁仓。这让我进一步相信他们是以身作则决心将该功能推行下去，同时也对自己当初用CHE换HDT的“明智”之举感到欣慰（理由是这样：总共就2100w枚，官方以0.1u做初始流动性的100w枚被砸盘被动接了40w枚左右，再加上官方自己回购的近300w枚，这些均已锁仓那么市场上流通的HDT总共也就不到1700w枚，按照当时的单价0.05u流通市值不到85wu，这要稍微出点儿利好还不得拉飞，至少10倍起好吧） \n  \n 另一边Solana公链迅速崛起，在SOL的带领下，我那两个被腰斩再腰斩的SRM和RAY也终于动了起来，不久RAY又上了币安，短时间RAY直接突破5U，虽然距离13U成本还较遥远，但只要有动静就至少能看到些回本的希望。与此同时一个比较火爆的ATLAS游戏项目宣布即将在FTX和Raydium上进行打新（老杨为此在8.15还专门开了一期钉钉直播），这可以说是为Solana的火爆再次加了一把火，很快SOL就直接突破前高不再辜负任何人的往上冲了，RAY也因为在Raydium上需要提前质押才能参与IDO而再次起飞。这时我做了个比较激进的决定，一方面直接将SRM全部换成了已突破前高的SOL（这俩币种一个已破前高一个还在被腰斩，所以在不亏本的前提下算来直接将我的SOL成本拉至208U，后来在群里看到别人说SOL不辜负任何人的时候我总会调侃的插一句：不，它还辜负我，希望可以冲到200U让我回本）；另一方面我将在OEC上的8wU提至币安直接一个挂单以7.69U的价格梭了1w个RAY，将我的RAY成本一把拉低至8.6U，如此按照一个账号质押500RAY的标准增加了20个账号参与打新，再加上之前被套被动持有并质押了几个月的账户一下子将可参与打新的票数增加了三倍。原本我寻思着RAY再拉个1u就可以顺带将高位接盘套了几个月的RAY解套回本，可事实却是直接回调了1u跌到6.6，被套的不但没解套反而又折了1wu本金在里面，此刻回想起来老杨直播时候教的合约对冲才真的是感同身受，但想到可以质押一边挖矿一边参加IDO打新活动就硬着头皮坚持了下来。果然没过几天Raydium上的RAY开始质押，一大波套利者一边买现货去质押一边做空对冲，还有一部分从币安抵押主流币借RAY过来质押，没想到币安借Solana链不稳定钱包维护为名开始了单机拉盘模式，RAY在短时间内直接40个点涨幅一度突破10u，合约做空的都成了上涨的燃料，抵押借币的安全系数直线下降，由于暂停了RAY充提所以只能继续增加抵押物进去以避免强制平仓，跟其它交易所之间眼瞅着有较大的差价却无法搬砖。此刻满手现货的我长舒了一口气：终于TMD解套回本了。 \n  \n 跌宕起伏的八月终于结束，伴随着ATLAS的打新活动迎来了九月，FTX交易所的中签模式由于我账户少且解质押需要14天的时间成本选择了放弃只参加Raydium上的彩票模式。还算幸运95票中了7票，让我没想到的是这次的打新收益却出奇的高，虽然最后卖的不算太好，去掉成本足足赚了2.5wu，而RAY本身的涨幅不仅让我被套数月的4wU回本解套还有了部分利润。有了不久前坐过山车的经历，这次我有了一个相对保守和成熟的想法，就跟媳妇儿商量把剩下的房贷提前一笔结清，不过也坦白这次仍然需要她的帮忙和助力，于是先帮她约好招商银行网点公积金提取（用结婚证+我的公积金提取记录很快就一笔到账15w+），然后将她工商的10w理财赎回，我这边从币圈撤出来141980，加上刚办的邮储鼎致白需要刷免首年年费刷了5.9w出来，剩下的就是我自己攒的一些积蓄，终于赶在9.7当天将剩余的房贷提前连本带息一把结清。那一天是我来到这个世界的整整第30年（1991.9.7)，按耐不住内心久经压抑的喜悦我发了条简单的朋友圈：“用三年时间走完别人三十年的路...很累很痛苦但值得...”之所以需要媳妇儿帮忙和助力是因为7号晚上Raydium还有一个打新活动Grape（葡萄）需要投入USDC，所以资金还无法立刻全部撤出，否则就得放弃参加活动才有可能赶在9.7那样一个有纪念意义的日子把仅剩的最后一笔大的负债清零。就这样9.7晚投入后的次日我又撤出来151680放尊享版余利宝里洗白顺便赚点儿活期收益。9.11我有幸受一个看过我上一篇万字长文的兄弟邀请去参加了一个线下的小型聚餐，那天说真的受益良多也学习到了好多，受那晚的影响，回去后我开始陆续将资金从RAY和SOL撤出，SOL其实就是从SRM转移过去的，那么高的成本也是我强行把SRM亏的算SOL上的，根据我的数据统计SRM被套数月最终亏了3479.381u出局。之后我也有认真想过关于资产配置的问题，想着如何才能够做到涨跌不惊，发现我手里的现金在还完所有负债后竟然只有不到1w块，于是9.21我再次撤出13w作为家庭的日常消费金。至此，我对比7月底OEC启动时候的情况并做了个统计：时隔俩月，我所有的收获就是从币圈撤出人民币440994元，然后手里的U从当初11.52w变成了15.49w。仔细想来其实并不算特别成功，毕竟其中有我刚解套的RAY和割肉出局的SRM，当然OEC上此时还有全部从樱桃换为HDT的 27684.6228u 我在统计的时候按归零统计的。再回到HDT上，其实到9月中旬时候有过一波翻倍行情，但是由于樱桃项目方完全不在流动性上下功夫（除了项目方自己没有人愿意做流动性），导致行情大起大落一个小散户都能够左右行情的涨跌，更何况我当时已经长期霸占持币榜单前10名（334849个HDT，成本均价0.0827u），除了官方自己的地址，前面只有两三个樱桃大户比我持有的HDT多，根本没办法大规模卖出。让我没想到的是随着9.25的来临，火币宣布彻底退出大陆市场，造成了整个市场的恐慌，几乎所有币种当天全部飘红，HT直接跌回了个位数，与此同时中心化交易所的链上Defi开始各种崩盘，樱桃跌破1u，HDT直接跌到0.018u市值不足40wu，也就是那一刻我对樱桃彻底失去了信心把滑点调至最大，一把砸完换了5888u从OEC链上彻底退出（最终在樱桃上亏损成本21796.6228u）。至于从JF赚的那0.3个BTC，借着那波市场大跌CSPR一如既往的跟着跳楼，我选择一把将BTC全部梭哈换成了171503.9个CSPR。 \n  \n 国庆前的最后一天9.30币安开启了新一轮的LaunchPad打新活动（Beta），这次将大陆用户排除在外，我就尝试跟别人拼车感受了一把，国庆期间在家胡吃海喝好好的放松了一周，节后回来等Beta上币交易，果然利润还可以，除去借币利息到手1个点的收益率，而此时的BNB就因为这个打新活动已经从节前的340U涨至了440U。Beta上币交易那晚各大社群开始疯狂传播一张“如何8秒钟赚100w”的币安交易截图，原来是在开盘的时候快进快出正好赶上币价疯狂猛涨的过程，这个我是深有体会的（去年我曾在LIT上尝过甜头，短短不到一分钟赚了3wU出来），于是赌性又开始在自己的脑海中燃起：心想着如果有下一次我也不妨试上一试。果然没过几天币安又来一个新币挖矿LAZIO，看到消息我直接一把梭了近10wU进去，成本定格在了460.6567u，同时为了防止FTX趁机突袭搞新币活动，以53U的均价梭了300枚FTT，剩余的一部分资金选择了抵押借BNB，这次由于我的英国企业账户还没下来所以还是选择了跟人拼车，把币打给别人后我就跟随部门的小伙伴开启了一场四天三夜的呼伦贝尔outing之旅。 \n  \n 去那边一落地便由于地面积雪结冰而导致飞机滑行没滑到位给我们来了个下马威，出机场后大风夹着雪花打在脸上那个冷的呀，顿时有种后悔去那地方的感觉。中午跟随团队一行人在海拉尔诺敏塔拉奶茶店吃了饭身体才稍微暖和了些，吃完饭后出来发现雪还在下风大到人在外面都站不稳，听加油站的伙计说莫日格勒河景区可能会因为大风而暂时关闭，所以我们决定先回酒店休息，顺便等下上海和杭州还没到的小伙伴们。我回酒店房间后解决了会儿公司的问题就躺床上睡了一觉等起来后发现天都黑了，看了下钉钉群里的消息，上海和杭州的伙伴们受海拉尔天气影响有的备降至哈尔滨，有的备降至呼和浩特，只好我们一行人开车去菌香园火锅吃了超级好吃的火锅（我吃了超级多的羊肉卷～）；次日天气放晴好的根本想象不出前一天的天气有多恶劣，我们跟上海的伙伴们一行五辆车自驾从海拉尔出发至额尔古纳湿地公园景区，路上看到的风景虽不比七八月份但也算相对壮观了，好不容易赶中午到了人家景区没开放，我们就拿着队旗在外面一起拍了照片就出发去了下一个景点“白桦林”，白桦林景区的雪超级厚，一脚踩下去脚脖子都没了，但由于好久都没见过那么洁白且那么厚的雪还是跟随小伙伴们一起爬了白桦林，在那里像小时候那般打雪仗，还摔了几个屁墩儿，等到下山的时候鞋子里已经湿透了但心里却是开心的，上车后就把鞋脱了在副驾打开暖风眯了一会儿，返程的时候趁着夜幕降临又去前一天没去成的莫日格勒河打了个卡，等到我们返回海拉尔市的时候已经晚上快八点钟了，这时候杭州的小伙伴们总算是到了，就一起去索伦嘎烤味道去吃烧烤喝啤酒至深夜（有小伙伴完事儿回酒店打了个卡又出去洗浴搓澡加桑拿了，我没去～）；第三天我们在酒店吃过早饭大约10点半钟集结了六辆车各自都加好油再次从海拉尔出发直达呼伦湖，去那边买了门票车可以直接开到湖旁边，我们在那里买了干鱼片投喂海鸥，视野极其开阔，神经极度放松，大家在一起有说有笑其乐融融。呼伦湖出来后就开车直达满洲里，到达满洲里后已经近两点了，我们选择去卢布里西餐厅吃俄餐，在别有一番风情装饰的西餐厅中见到了俄国妹子吃了一顿还算丰盛的西餐，用餐过后我们又开车去了俄罗斯套娃景区和中俄国门，天空飘着雪花，难拒老板娘盛情，便请老板娘帮我拍了张照片在朋友圈里秀了一番，结束后大约五点半便开始从满洲里返程海拉尔。一路上都是高速，但路上基本都是雪水偶尔还有结冰路段，我在后排把座椅放倒躺平睡了半路，快回市里的时候收到消息最后一晚大家自由搭配去吃饭，我们这车里的正好是平日工作中的同一小组便一起去吃了铁锅炖鱼，说实话是真心的好吃。吃完后听闻有小伙伴们在酒店附近打台球，我们也一起去凑了个热闹，最后那个小店的三个台球桌全部被我们包场一直玩到凌晨快一点，真的是开心极了。第四天早上起来洗了个澡在酒店吃完早餐就等着去机场还车然后返程回京～ \n  \n 10.19直接去了公司新办公区上班，超高层视野超级棒，可以直接看到北京地标建筑大裤衩，我的工位抬头平视过去就是普华永道事务所的牌子。碰巧看到老杨群里有人在出GODS已付款CoinList账号，我就以1600u一个梭了7个第一轮。没过两天LAZIO挖矿结束开始上币交易，此次我就拿了1wU去试试手看能否赚波大的，谁知道币安出了个幺蛾子，都已经开盘了好多人都还没收到币导致币价插针到100U很快跌至63U，紧接着60U、50U、40U，我直接35U挂了1wU一把梭进去，结果梭完就一直下跌，直至22U选择了止损出局，这一波下来跟人拼车的收益与自己的骚操作相抵基本等于白干，无奈原本跟人家约好的还要3个GODS的第二轮只得放弃，这事儿刚过OK便宣布开始重启Jumpstart，新币便是GODS。OKB在这个挖矿热情的带领下从十几U最高差点儿拉翻倍，借币利息年华已经破百，为了参与这个项目我等回调找了个点位以23.5U的价格直接梭了2000枚，果然币价蹭蹭蹭的往上涨，就在这时老杨宣布他研究出了低息借币的方法并于10.22晚开启直播分享，果然老杨的方法令人叫绝，不仅成本低而且可操作性极强。就这样直播结束后我陆续以27.6u和28.5u的价格通过全仓卖币做空锁定了单币4-5u的利润，由于资金量较小所以只搞了两个号，最终活动结束后上线卖出两个号总共获利2400U，由于做空而锁定的利润有9800U之多，这样一来我买的那7个GODS第一轮就算零成本了。这边刚结束10.28币安又出公告开始用BNB挖DAR，这次不限制大陆用户终于可以用自己的账户挖了，根据以往的经验前七天收益不错我的BNB就全部放进去挖了。 \n  \n 十月结束，十一月接踵而至。如果说十月是出师不利，那么十一月应该算是十面埋伏了。1号晚上去Raydium参与NFT打新，虽然DropZone上第一轮武士头像的NFT打新我参与亏了30个SOL（单个成本3SOL，中了10个），但想到上一轮的狮子中签则几倍的涨幅且有机器人火爆抢购，寻思这次有质押RAY的门槛应该收益不会太差，可没想到这次的猴子项目却是个不折不扣的土狗项目，就5000个NFT单价才1SOL超募近16倍竟然能破发直至归零，我几乎上了全部家当冲了450SOL，中签26SOL，结果可想而知，最后在3号晚上盲盒即将到期前1个小时对该项目彻底绝望以0.2SOL亏损80%出局（加上SOL本身的涨幅简直惨不忍睹），受这个项目的打击4号那个项目我去掉了一半借贷只保留了450SOL的参与额度，到4号投入SOL的那晚我开始观察大家的投入情况，发现市场情绪不是一般的低落时间过半才超募不到两倍，尽管我很想赚钱回本但还是不得不忍痛选择放弃，结果也如预期一样上线即破发。这时微信群里一个消息炸开，说元宇宙的标杆项目AXS所在的侧链Ronin即将发币，将其10%的代币分配给在刚刚上线的Dex Katana上的两个流动性LP池子（AXS/ETH和SLP/ETH），我当时的第一感觉是机会来了，想到AXS的市值远大于SLP，以为同等资金SLP挖矿的效率一定会远高于AXS，于是当晚就直接以0.11u的单价梭了5wU，5号醒来就直接亏了1wU，既然已经被套住了就索性借了ETH去Ronin搭配做流动性挖RON。本以为这样去挖矿心里能好受些，结果当天下午币安又出了为期10天的新一期LaunchPad，正是需要杠杆抵押借币的时候我却被一个没有总量上限的小币套牢5wU还得被迫借ETH去做流动性，心中很是郁闷啊～这还不算，到了6号早上想起来大橙子朋友圈推荐的波卡基础DAO项目SubDao在其官网正进行代币的IDO，于是赶紧去看了下募资情况，感觉热度还算可以，就把手里的最后2wU提到ETH链冲了进去，本以为快进快出发了币撸一波就跑，可谁曾想募资结束后却死活找不到领币的入口，于是混到电报群里问claim代币的流程，被告知需要锁一个月才给发币，而且首期只给发50%，剩下的50%分三个月来给...心态崩了～至此手里除了当初梭的BNB和FTT全部亏完归零，所有的一切再重新来过。本以为这个月没救了，没想到几天之后的双十一我却抓住了两次小小的机会。双十一那天早上不知道为啥五点多就醒了，一看大盘崩了，带动的RAY直接12个点的跌幅，赶紧起来寻思去买点RAY做借币的利息（为了参与GENE的打新活动高息借了6000枚RAY去质押），打开Raydium上的Trading后发现跟币安的价格竟有单个0.4u的差价，马上想到这是个无风险套利的机会，于是币安直接用BNB全仓借USDT买RAY，然后Raydium上通过芒果借RAY出来砸盘，由于大资金全部被套牢只能小资金来回腾挪，就直接放弃了一个号500RAY的质押，解质押出来后直接砸盘，一边从币安及时发起RAY提币到SOL钱包，一边从SOL钱包充值砸盘所得的USDT到币安。就这样反复操作了几把到天亮币安关闭了RAY的提现，统计了下大概撸了有3000多U；晚上又被12号早八点即将空投BOBA的嫩模币（OMG）带了一把热度，当时大部分想要获得空投的人都是买现货然后合约做空套保，导致OMG现货和合约价格出现了2U多的偏离，合约做空的人需要给合约做多的人非常离谱的资金费率，于是新的套利模型出现：从币安全仓借OMG出来高位砸盘，然后再以低于现货2U多的价格开合约做多。这样操作的成本就是本身借币的利息，而收益却有两部分：来自做空合约的资金费率 和 空投快照之后现货与合约间价格磨平的差价。由于合约我本身操作的不是很熟练导致做多OMG数量比借币做空多了200枚，导致利润出现了部分回撤，最终一个账户操作了2700枚OMG去掉成本3个多BNB借币利息净收益5800多U。整体来看这个双十一运气还是不错的，可能与双十一当天给媳妇儿买了个华为P50 Pro顶配（7458裸机 + 199超级快充） 佛晓粉（8GB + 512GB）有关系吧，哈哈～ \n  \n 以时间为轴线的流水账式回顾就到这里，下面说说我自己的一些感悟和思考。在当下这个各种热点层出不穷到处充斥着梭屎币暴富玩游戏暴富甚至空投暴富的牛市当中，老实讲我的内心深处是相当浮躁且焦虑的。虽然也付费进了一些个高质量的社群，但我跟大部分人的资产都相差不是一个量级，资产量级的不同投资策略自然也会不同，对于他们而言稳稳的套利就比普通人上班能够赚到的多很多。我也曾认真想过是不是应该跟着大家一起稳稳套利，慢慢变富，毕竟财不如急门。然而回首过去几个月的经历我终于明白了：八仙过海，各显神通。在投资这条路上，每个人都有属于自己的风格和思路，或许我达到一定的资产量级也会选择稳稳套利，但绝不是现在。从18年初入场至今，一路从负债两百万死扛到今天负债全部清零盈利百万这其中的曲折和艰辛有多不容易只有自己知道，这个过程中没看过一本书、没经过一个高人指点。坏处是我没有经过系统的学习付出了高昂的成本和代价，好处是我所有的经验都是从实践中获得的，相比理论更深刻且更实用。这其中最最重要的一个经验教训就是：**做投资任何时候都不要加杠杆，不论是场内还是场外。杠杆和合约对于普通人只可以作为一种套利和对冲的工具仅此而已。**519之前我只知道要赚到人生第一个一百万不容易，现在我明白要守住第一个一百万更加的不容易。为此，我不惜以身犯险大战OEC三件套，看到Solana崛起果断换车追涨梭RAY，看到链游元宇宙火爆直接场外收购7个GODS，看到OK的Jumpstart重启果断追涨OKB（高位再杠杆做空），看到币安的Launchpad不断直接追涨BNB...这才勉强守住本轮牛市的整整100万利润。 \n  \n 再谈谈目前我的持仓应对策略及整体打法。0.11U梭的5wU SLP目前已经几乎腰斩，割肉意义不大，第一天冲进去跟借的ETH搭配挖矿到现在，被动增持了1.5wU SLP，成本拉低到0.1041U，按照目前的锁仓量挖矿平均每天按挖出80枚RON为例，创世挖矿期三个月，可挖7200枚，按照10U一个可直接将SLP挖到零成本。如果RON上线后有RON自身的流动性二池，我会毫不犹豫的一把将SLP砸了换车RON，一方面降低RON持有成本，另一方面赌AXS之后还有其它应用在它上面跑，这样的话RON之于RONIN就相当于AVAX之于Avalanche，SOL之于Solana，FTM之于Fantom，BNB之于BSC，ETH之于Ethereum...波卡生态误投的2wU GOV现在只能被动等解锁了，考虑到该项目同时在Gate和抹茶有Startup超募，上线这些交易所应该问题不大，12.4解锁一半只要能够翻一倍到0.44u即可收回成本，后面的50%即为零成本。至于CSPR（纯属骗人）没啥好的策略：“死拿”。想了半天能让我一直拿住这个币的理由就是拿它跟EOS做对比：这条公链只比EOS晚一年从18年开始到现在推特关注人数10w+应该不是真的纯属骗人；上过CoinList自带光环相比EOS当初大都是割韭菜的中国大佬站台筹码相对分散；总量是EOS的十倍，按照EOS 5U算也该0.5U一枚；质押收益近10个点比EOS 两三个点高太多（这个是吸引我拿住非常关键的一个因素，回本之前就当买银行理财了）；如果非得还有一个理由那就是该项目不是国人主导。（**郑重提示：以上仅为个人观点，不代表任何投资建议。投资有风险，理财需谨慎**） \n  \n 好了，以上就是我这期想要分享和记录的主要内容了。本篇内容始于9.5，中间断断续续的一直到今天11.21才全部完结，啰哩啰嗦的写了这么多相信能一口气读完的人也不多。后面再要做这样的复盘和总结或许要等下个熊市了，接下来的规划一方面要充当家里的顶梁柱把自己的本职工作做好为家庭赚取一份稳定的收入，另一方面还是以投资为主套利为辅争取这轮牛市能够保留住200w胜利的果实，厚积薄发到下一轮的时候有5倍就基本可以结束北漂了。",

These accounts are secured with a private key, which can be transformed into a 12 word “seed phrase” for the user. If that private key is compromised in any way, the funds can be stolen.\n\nIf your business comprises of more than 1 person, an externally owned accounts is not a secure way to manage your crypto business’s funds. If an employee goes rogue or is careless with the private key, the funds are gone forever. Even if your business is made up of just yourself, I’d argue it’s still a poor way to manage funds. So, what is the better solution?\n\nEnter the Multisig. Gnosis Safe is a smart contract wallet running on Ethereum that requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction before it can occur (M-of-N). If for example you have 3 main stakeholders in your business, you are able to set up the wallet to require approval from all 3 people before the transaction is sent. This assures that no single person could compromise the funds.\n\nOn top of that, Gnosis Safe gives you complete self custody over your funds. There is no risk of a bank giving you a hassle for running a crypto business and the smart contract that is deployed is completely trustless and in your control.\n\nHere's an overview, comparing the Gnosis Safe to other digital asset storage solutions:", "timestamp": 1653383023, "digest": "WGdV8mFJKqkdQ51dMVRbNZJghAQFkV7NiYCbKXG9ZQs", "contributor": "0xb80bd21033Cc4DcfDC9DfE5ec9E46cabd4128d8D"}

However, according to some reports, this is not just a passing buzzword that may vanish into the night. Scientists and health practitioners are also eyeing for their work.\n\nCurrently, NFTs have been extensively adopted by fields such as gaming, art and other collectibles. According to Dune Analytics’ data collation, OpenSea recorded nearly [$3.25 billion transactions](https://www.digitaljournal.com/business/taking-nfts-into-the-science-and-technology-sphere/article) on the Ethereum blockchain in the past one year. At the moment, most of them are art works.\n\n### Baby steps towards science and technology\n\nDigital assets and by extension, NFTs are beginning to appear on the scientific horizon. This tentatively includes Nobel prize- winning research as well as augmented reality photos of space. Case in point: Last year, the University of California auctioned off documents in the form of NFT belonging to James Allison, an eminent Nobel prize winner who was a cancer researcher, for more than US$50,000.\n\nFrom a macroscopic point of view, scientists can leverage blockchain and its assorted tools such as tokens and smart contracts to improve upon collaboration between their peers and stakeholders. This new way of working has a name- decentralized science or DeSci in short.\n\nDeSci will help develop platforms that will empower people to work on scientific matters at a more fundamental level. This would allow for a new layer for a modern scientific revolution. This would allow decentralization of access to scientific resources which in turn would allow citizen scientists to participate in new ways of research.\n\nWith respect to [DeSci](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nfts-web3-and-the-metaverse-are-changing-the-way-scientists-conduct-research), the people who generate value such as scientists, contributors, citizen scientists gain proportionate value in terms of their respective contributions. Essentially DeSci is creating new ways to contribute and collaborate in ways that were previously unimaginable- until blockchain came along.\n\n### NFTS and scientific research\n\nNFT will play a huge role in the metaverse as through NFTs scientific research could be transferred in a secure manner. To elaborate one of the examples listed above, the US Space Force which is an arm of the US Armed Forces recently began selling NFT series of augmented reality (AR) images featuring space and satellites. George Church, who is a biology pioneer, owns a company known as Nebula Genomics. The company is contemplating selling NFT of Church’s genome.\n\n![Bridging the gap](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qA5mR8B9Hxq2KYM7aRzJc.png?height=683&width=1024)\n\n### NFTs and personal health information\n\nAs a lot of health practitioners might know, people usually don’t have control over their own health data once it is a part of the system. Nobody has a clear idea on how the personal data is shared or distributed once it is digitized.\n\nBlockchain, and by extension, NFT contracts could help solve that problem. The NFT digital contracts could help the patient to specify who has the authority to access their personal health information as well as track how it is shared.\n\nHowever, it must be noted that NFT adoption in the medical field is not sunshine and rainbows. Experts have pointed out there are still vulnerabilities pertaining to privacy, security and potential disputes over intellectual property rights. An average citizen may find navigating through NFTs particularly challenging.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll said and done, by weighing the pros and cons, we can say NFTs will definitely change the lives of everyone- from artists to an average Joe. The question is when, not if.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n### How can you reach us?\n\n**Twitter**: @gwsofficialNFT\n\n**Discord**: [https://discord.gg/KHe9YyjDmz ](https://discord.gg/KHe9YyjDmz)\n\n**Instagram**:<https://www.instagram.com/gwsofficialnft/>\n\n**Telegram**: <https://t.me/+K89a-DsFOkY5ODY0>\n\n**Whatsapp**: <https://chat.whatsapp.com/GUCTg7VPOoNGXBh5S5Y5TK>\n\n**Facebook**: <https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100080914332795&sk=about>\n\n**Reddit**: <https://www.reddit.com/user/gwsofficialnft>\n\n**Quora**: <https://www.quora.com/profile/Marketing-GWS>\n\n**TikTok**: <https://www.tiktok.com/@gwsofficial.nft?lang=en>", "timestamp": 1653388172, "digest": "BUA9gucyCbnRg_TD_BDjOlTFv76dHgi5S8AaA4bwVn8", "contributor": "0x6E2aE861d64d8E56E6438731b52920c9CBB430Cc"}

However, according to some reports, this is not just a passing buzzword that may vanish into the night. Scientists and health practitioners are also eyeing for their work.\n\nCurrently, NFTs have been extensively adopted by fields such as gaming, art and other collectibles. According to Dune Analytics’ data collation, OpenSea recorded nearly [$3.25 billion transactions](https://www.digitaljournal.com/business/taking-nfts-into-the-science-and-technology-sphere/article) on the Ethereum blockchain in the past one year. At the moment, most of them are art works.\n\n### Baby steps towards science and technology\n\nDigital assets and by extension, NFTs are beginning to appear on the scientific horizon. This tentatively includes Nobel prize- winning research as well as augmented reality photos of space. Case in point: Last year, the University of California auctioned off documents in the form of NFT belonging to James Allison, an eminent Nobel prize winner who was a cancer researcher, for more than US$50,000.\n\nFrom a macroscopic point of view, scientists can leverage blockchain and its assorted tools such as tokens and smart contracts to improve upon collaboration between their peers and stakeholders. This new way of working has a name- decentralized science or DeSci in short.\n\nDeSci will help develop platforms that will empower people to work on scientific matters at a more fundamental level. This would allow for a new layer for a modern scientific revolution. This would allow decentralization of access to scientific resources which in turn would allow citizen scientists to participate in new ways of research.\n\nWith respect to [DeSci](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nfts-web3-and-the-metaverse-are-changing-the-way-scientists-conduct-research), the people who generate value such as scientists, contributors, citizen scientists gain proportionate value in terms of their respective contributions. Essentially DeSci is creating new ways to contribute and collaborate in ways that were previously unimaginable- until blockchain came along.\n\n### NFTS and scientific research\n\nNFT will play a huge role in the metaverse as through NFTs scientific research could be transferred in a secure manner. To elaborate one of the examples listed above, the US Space Force which is an arm of the US Armed Forces recently began selling NFT series of augmented reality (AR) images featuring space and satellites. George Church, who is a biology pioneer, owns a company known as Nebula Genomics. The company is contemplating selling NFT of Church’s genome.\n\n![Bridging the gap](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qA5mR8B9Hxq2KYM7aRzJc.png?height=683&width=1024)\n\n### NFTs and personal health information\n\nAs a lot of health practitioners might know, people usually don’t have control over their own health data once it is a part of the system. Nobody has a clear idea on how the personal data is shared or distributed once it is digitized.\n\nBlockchain, and by extension, NFT contracts could help solve that problem. The NFT digital contracts could help the patient to specify who has the authority to access their personal health information as well as track how it is shared.\n\nHowever, it must be noted that NFT adoption in the medical field is not sunshine and rainbows. Experts have pointed out there are still vulnerabilities pertaining to privacy, security and potential disputes over intellectual property rights. An average citizen may find navigating through NFTs particularly challenging.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll said and done, by weighing the pros and cons, we can say NFTs will definitely change the lives of everyone- from artists to an average Joe. The question is when, not if.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n### How can you reach us?\n\n**Twitter**: @gwsofficialNFT\n\n**Discord**: [https://discord.gg/KHe9YyjDmz ](https://discord.gg/KHe9YyjDmz)\n\n**Instagram**:<https://www.instagram.com/gwsofficialnft/>\n\n**Telegram**: <https://t.me/+K89a-DsFOkY5ODY0>\n\n**Whatsapp**: <https://chat.whatsapp.com/GUCTg7VPOoNGXBh5S5Y5TK>\n\n**Facebook**: <https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100080914332795&sk=about>\n\n**Reddit**: <https://www.reddit.com/user/gwsofficialnft>\n\n**Quora**: <https://www.quora.com/profile/Marketing-GWS>\n\n**TikTok**: <https://www.tiktok.com/@gwsofficial.nft?lang=en>", "timestamp": 1653388154, "digest": "BUA9gucyCbnRg_TD_BDjOlTFv76dHgi5S8AaA4bwVn8", "contributor": "0x6E2aE861d64d8E56E6438731b52920c9CBB430Cc"}
{"id": "SBTKwCoO_xRlkoGwxVIHv2VYC8hAdAgc2ZWTVFTSR2w", "title": "Thoughts on the emerging \"Asset Management as a Service\" trend", "body": "As of May 24th 2022, the last weeks have been a roller-coaster for the crypto & stock market and confirming the entrance into the bear territory: from the “algorithmic stable coin” UST losing its 1:1 peg and LUNA freefalling from $100 to $0.01, to BTC plunging below $30K, or more recently, [the Coinbase Q1FY22 report](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001679788/89c60d81-41a2-4a3c-86fb-b4067ab1016c.pdf) stating that users’ funds could be wiped out under a bankruptcy event scenario. These headlines have been the caviar of the breaking news, Twitter, LinkedIn, and even Instagram. I haven’t heard anyone from my IRL/online network speaking, or complaining, about this drop in the last weeks.\n\nThe current state of the global economy and the endless news related to the crypto market has motivated me to finalize the draft of this article and share my thoughts on the emerging segment within FinTech that I call “ Asset Management as a Service”.\n\nDefinition & Introduction.\n\nI discovered this new segment a few months ago while I was mingling between Discord groups to get deals data – jumping in a brief chat with a user, which seems to be financially literate, leads to the asset diversification in the crypto space debate and my first introduction to “Asset Management as a Service”. I could define   “Asset Management as a Service \" as the way to manage and invest clients/LPs’ funds without the need to have ownership and total access and/or control over the financial assets. On the opposite of the traditional approach, where Clients/LPs give up ownership and full control of their funds over a fixed time. It leverages multiple technologies like APIs, AI/ML, and blockchain to disrupt the legacy Asset Management.\n\nAfter a quick research, the recent data and metrics related to Asset Management blow my mind: this juicy industry [sized $103 trillion in 2021](https://web-assets.bcg.com/79/bf/d1d361854084a9624a0cbce3bf07/bcg-global-asset-management-2021-jul-2021.pdf), and retail portfolios represented 41% of global assets, or $42 trillion according to BCG. The global crypto trend & pandemic have largely contributed to the spike in interest of retail investors for investment products, the US equity trading activity [has doubled since the beginning of the pandemic](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-new-way-to-look-at-retail-trading-trends) according to Nasdaq data, rising from around $18 billion/day (pre-2020) to around $32 billion/day in March 2020. Parallelly, the number of crypto owners expects to grow from [295 million to 1 billion](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hfgyig42jimx/5i8TeN1QYJDjn82pSuZB5S/85c7c9393f3ee67e456ec780f9bf11e3/Cryptodotcom_Crypto_Market_Sizing_Jan2022.pdf) by the end of 2022. Additionally, the metrics from some companies operating in this space raised my attention to further dive in, like Kryll.io which managed to reach [+$3.5 billion traded volumes in April 2022](https://blog.kryll.io/kryll-changelog-monthly-progress-report-april-2022-metrics/), and the marketplace is operating/used across 112 countries. Or Zignaly, the profit-sharing/copy-trading platform gathers +55K users and manages +$60M AUM through API-linked crypto trading accounts.\n\nMarket Drivers\n\nAlthough the industry has seen some innovation over the past decade, it still remains fundamentally conservative given the nature of the business. In my opinion, the structural changes and new technology applied to finance will be key drivers of the emergence of the “Asset Management-as-a-Service”:\n\n* First and foremost, the global population is getting more educated about the Financial Market and the basics of Personal Finance. The multiplication of trading apps, like Binance or RobinHood, and neo-banking offering stock or crypto investing product illustrates the willingness of this new generation to keep full control and ownership over their financial assets. According to [The Motley Fool survey 2021](https://www.fool.com/research/what-are-gen-z-millennial-investors-buying/), 73% of Gen Z investors, and 66% of millennial investors own stocks, and unsurprisingly, 40% of stock investors aged 18 to 40 own cryptocurrencies, which demonstrates a genuine interest in the financial industry. Charles Swab talks now about the [“Generation I(nvestor)”.](https://www.aboutschwab.com/generation-investor-study-2021)\n\n \n\n* The decentralization of Investment Management knowledge outside of the banking/hedge fund space and the growing individual/independent investor community across social networks has largely participated in the disruption of the Asset Management landscape. The episode [Reddit’s traders vs HFs](https://www.ft.com/content/7a91e3ea-b9ec-4611-9a03-a8dd3b8bddb5), or the [anonymous Twitter user explaining step by step how to break Terra](https://twitter.com/FreddieRaynolds/status/1463960623402913797) in Nov. 2022,  illustrates the capacity of some retail investors to research/act like a \"professional\" investor. The community aspect and knowledge sharing play a big role in the evolution of the Asset Management industry: favoriting the \"multiplayer\" and \"community-belonging\" sentiment that leads to higher engagement. Additionally, the multiple FinMeme/StockMeme accounts on Instagram & Twitter gathering several millions of followers genuinely outline the exponential factor of Community in the global financial industry. A16Z addresses better the community-first social investing topic in the \"[Big ideas that fintech will tackle in 2022](https://a16z.com/2021/12/20/the-big-ideas-that-fintech-will-tackle-in-2022/#:\\~:text=In%202022%2C%20we'll%20see,fiat%20and%20crypto%20financial%20lives)” post.\n* Aforementioned above, trading platforms blossoming over the past years have upside down the traditional investing/trading market by granting commission-free, low-capital access, and fractional shares trading. The consumerization of the financial market and the democratization of retail investing activities play a subsequent stake in the emergence of the Asset Management-as-a-Service space, as well as, participating in the popularization of new investment instruments, like NFT or cryptocurrencies. Technical innovations applied to Financial Services – like API, Blockchain, Bots, or AI/ML – are the drivers of this new market. Quantitative/algorithmic investment strategies are getting more traction within the stock market in the past years (e.g. Two Sigma, Renaissance Technologies…), and automation has become a norm in the Finance industry. APIs can allow anyone to manage your brokerage/trading account with specific restrictions, Blockchain – especially smart contracts – acts as a safeguard/trusted-third party, and bots automize investment strategies while minimizing cognitive biases. Venture investments have started to hit the space, and startups have begun to stand out, such as the US-company Alpaca building a developer-first API for stock/crypto trading that secured [+$70M from VC firms](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/alpaca-raises-50m-to-rapidly-scale-its-equities-trading-api-business/), or Zignaly developing a profit-sharing based copy-trading platform for digital assets raised +$50M.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads me to think of a future where people would easily access  \"Plug'n'Play\" alpha-generating services within a few clicks, and anyone would be able to start \"independent\" Asset Management activities with enterprise-grade tools/ infrastructures.\n\nApplications:\n\nFrom my investigation, the Asset Management-as-a-Service landscape is growing over the days and attracting more retail and institutional investors. Applications within this space include: marketplaces matching Asset Managers & customers, create/rent/sell/buy investment strategies, NFT-based Asset Management, DAO, wallet-2-wallet following, API-based trading infrastructure, and enterprise-grade tools for retail investors/independent Asset Managers.

{"id": "R7-wnwEvolgH1N8pweBxkXv7_1PKNjE1Als-9AbKXTs", "title": "人殉", "body": "      “人殉”，顾名思义，就是用活人殉葬，死亡的达官贵人、统治者渴望在另一个世界里继续过着有人伺候和奉养的好日子，于是便把生前供他们役使的奴仆、嫔妃、婢女甚至将领杀掉，陪自己一同埋进地下。这无疑是一种残忍之至、邪恶至极的做法。虽然考古证明，早在母系氏族社会就出现了这一现象，但第一个以此臭名昭著的是秦武公。清末刘声木所撰笔记《苌楚斋随笔》里提到：“以人殉葬，始于秦武公，当时死者六十六人，至秦穆公，遂用至一百七十七人，而子车氏三人在焉。”《左传》详细记载：“秦伯任好卒，以子车氏三奄息、仲行、针虎为殉，皆秦之良也，国人哀之，为之赋《黄鸟》。”\n\n       奄息、仲行、针虎是秦国有名的贤良，杀此三人殉葬，等于自毁干城，秦国人作《黄鸟》一诗表达对人殉制度的愤怒。《苌楚斋随笔》继续说道：“至秦始皇，则凡后宫无子者，皆令从死。”负责建造坟墓的工匠，尤其那些制造防止盗墓的机关的工匠们，在秦始皇陵落成的那一天也被悉数赶进坟墓内活埋。据记载，“当时死者，当不下数万人，暴秦之虐，不特始作俑者，皆为苛政，且愈用愈多，杀人如蝼蚁，可谓酷也！历代人君相沿，用之千余年”。在千余年的时间里，不知道有多少无辜的人被当做陪葬品，跟那些帝王将相一起埋进了地下。不过总体看来，随着历史的进步，人殉一点点被“简化”。\n\n       尤其宋代，随着儒学的兴盛，“人殉”这么不“仁义”的事儿，哪个皇帝也不愿意摊上千古骂名，所以极其罕见，即使有，陪葬者的数量也大幅减少。但到明太祖朱元璋，这一恶行又死灰复燃，“太祖崩，宫人多从死者”。明代学者王世贞在笔记《弇山堂别集》中记录，由于死者太多，且其后又发生“靖难之役”，国家陷入一团混乱。以致朱棣打下南京夺取政权后，有人提出加封这些宫人的亲属，都很难一一核对名单：“独有所谓张凤、李衡、赵福、张璧、汪宾者，初以锦衣卫所试百户，散骑带刀舍人，进为本所千户百户。”永乐初年，朝廷商议对建文帝时期升授的官员该怎么办时，提到这几个千户百户，朱棣“开恩”说：“这几家都是好职事，不动。通调孝陵卫带俸世袭。”后来人们一直管这几户人家叫“天女户”。我们知道，其实朱棣的残暴程度不亚其父，在人殉这件事情上也深得继承。据《李朝实录》所记：“帝之崩，宫人殉葬者三十余人。当死之日，皆饷于庭，饷撤，俱引升堂，哭声震殿阁。堂上置大小床，使立其上，挂绳圈于其上，以头纳入其中，遂去其床，皆雉经而死。”", "timestamp": 1653388346, "digest": "2NA3sADzuwylF4KdyPxkSZgE_o7jVDBFifzsgVzJgLc", "contributor": "0x39bC6138676b9F85656f0Cf1F655282d523fDbEb"}

创作者经济模式的颠覆？本次我们试图聚焦创作者经济市场，先简述当前主流 Web2 平台创作者的商业模式和核心痛点，而后举证 Web3 的到来会是一个使天平向有利于创作者的方向倾斜的故事。我们希望 Web3 的技术能在不久的未来开启新的商业模式和经济机会，带来一个新的创作黄金时代。\n\n# 1 回溯Web发展史\n\n## 1.1 web1-web3的迭代\n\n在人类历史的大部分时间里，大多数人都在从事生产或耕作。21世纪最重要的两个产出是代码和内容。代码创造了强大的工具，除其他事项外，还帮助分发内容。内容支撑起强大的叙事，除其他外，有助于将更多的经济活动置于软件工具的支配之下。两者都旨在使抽象的想法变得可操作。\n\n根据互联网时代不同阶段的特点，我们可以把互联网历史发展进程标记为Web 1.0、2.0 和 3.0 时代。移动互联网的出现让web1控制内容创作和发行的旧媒体守门人——出版商、唱片公司和电影制片厂——转移到web2平台里吸引消费者注意力的创作者身上。在web2发展的黄金十年（约 2005-2015 年）里，我们生活在一个所有权集中在几个中心化技术平台的时期，这些平台拥有数据所属权、用户关系、分发和货币化内容的手段。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sI9LZtxIXVuqYmE_K6dLe.png?height=600&width=1022)\n\n### 1.2 为什么是创作者经济 & 创作者\n\n数字媒体格局在过去十年发生了巨大变化。举例来说，在中国，直播观看时长超过了电视观看时长。在美国，25 岁以下用户观看 Twitch 和 YouTube Live 的时间也比电视多。主播、网红等web2时代的内容核心创造者正在抓住消费者以前分配给传统媒体的注意力，创造了诸如内容电商、直播电商等新型消费模式。截止2021年，创作者经济已是一个拥有超过 5000 万的创作者群体的数百亿美金的市场，吸引超过13亿美元的资金。根据  [mediakix](https://mediakix.com/blog/influencer-marketing-industry-ad-spend-chart/)  的估计，未来 5 年，创作者经济的市场规模在 50 亿到 100 亿美元之间。\n\n# 2 主流web2平台的创作者变现模式以及存在的核心痛点\n\n在SignalFire的创作者经济市场地图中提到，估算的 5000 万创作者中有，全职创作者大约有 200 万人（占比不到5%），业余创作者大约有4670万人。有必要强调的是，web2重点关注的创作者，群体画像是依靠主流社交媒体分发自己创作的内容，积累粉丝，然后靠赞助或广告的模式盈利，而不是与受众（用户）直接交易。\n\n我们将web2现有的内容创作者大致划分为以下几类：\n\n* 内容消费者：泛指绝大部分的内容消费受众。日常消费内容或者参与点赞评论转发三连的互动人群，内容生产意愿相比消费和互动意愿较低（但具备转化潜力）。\n* 兴趣爱好者：泛指基于兴趣或兼职创作内容的人。随着各种多媒体工具帮助降低创作门槛，任何人都可以在中心化平台发布即兴创作的内容。\n* 职业创作者：泛指拥有内容生产的专业技能并能全职投入维持生计的人。这类创作者往往入驻在多个主流平台，通过内容生产积累粉丝，变现模式主要包括广告变现、平台补贴、内容电商、用户付费和IP授权。他们的专业性更强，创作水准更高，平台也会倾倒相应流量进行创作者扶持以吸引更多内容消费者留存。\n* 头部创作者：泛指在职业创作者中某些垂类领域有深度影响力或拥有广泛受众的。他们通常比平台更具话语权，基于个体影响力成立公司，与多个外部平台或品牌形成合作关系，比如 媒体公司、唱片公司、MCN机构等。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nFQuVU3ke-EjVu0RWzQen.png?height=560&width=1262)\n\n互联网带来的巨大规模效应注定让web2是一个几家中心化大平台的霸权割据时代。这种商业模式非常依赖封闭式网络，即各家平台独享自己累积的用户数据。作为能够决定流量和收益分配方式的强势方，大型平台是这一阶段创作者经济繁荣的最大收益者。其次才是头部创作者。\n\n我们归纳web2创作者经济的核心痛点在于：\n\n1. 已有的蛋糕分配可以更合理：存量创作者市场内卷，各方利益分配不够公平\n   1. 平台掌握所有用户信息偏好，主导内容所有权和分发权而非内容创作者本身，引发不公平利益获取的恶性循环；\n   2. 头部KOL得益于早期增长红利吸引了一批稳定的内容消费者注意力，挤兑后发优质创作者的关注度，以及持续获得超越其内容生产价值的收益。尽管其内容创作存在可替代性和优化空间，但考虑到用户的注意力有限且依赖信息分发的惯性，广告商以及中心化平台的算法反馈偏向那些已经获得了注意力的创作者，其结果是只有少数创作者能爬到顶端并谋生。\n   3. 中长尾创作者们却只能勉强度日。以YouTube举例来说，大多数小型频道并不真正活跃，并受到食物链上层 YouTube 用户的欺负。德国研究员Mathias Bärtl证明，2016 年，前 3% 的频道获得了 90% 的收视率。这意味着 90% 的 YouTube 创作者都在争夺剩余的 10%。\n2. 新蛋糕在哪里？：实现持续性的内容数量增长和质量丰富需要新的创作者血液\n   1. 不存在的创造者（潜力消费者和中小白创造者）未被挖掘充分，没有被吸纳进创作者生态闭环；\n   2. 未被创造的创造没有可行的商业模式。被广告主、算法推荐影响创作者被迫寻求尽可能广泛的受众从而创作吸引广告和品牌方的内容。原本新鲜的创作内容由于没有可行的商业模式未被生产。\n3. 数据信息权利分配不公平：\n   1. 大数据收集和共享流通过程不透明导致隐私泄露和数据滥用等问题近年频频爆出。数据所有权的分配问题本质影响了数据使用权和后续的利益分配。\n   2. 尽管对数据权利敏感的消费者占比量不足够（“革命”动力不足），但大众、政府、和平台对于权利和隐私管理的重视程度在逐渐增加。中心化平台封闭管理用户数据的方式亟待变革。\n\n总的来说，web2的头部平台已经意识到了上述痛点并试图通过引入创新方式进行改革。比如：\n\n* Facebook CEO Zuckerberg 今年宣布，Instagram 将建立一套影响力工具，包括创作者商店、本地附属链接以及将影响者与品牌联系起来的市场，以利用这些机会。\n* Twitter 推出了一个超级关注功能，让狂热的推特用户为独家推文收费，并为音频聊天室付费。\n* TikTok 建立了一个本地市场，将广告商与创作者联系起来，还推出了 2 亿美元的基金来投资其顶级创作者。\n* 除了支付广告收入外，YouTube 还采取了创作者基金的路线，在其 TikTok 克隆产品 Shorts 上为创作者提供了 1 亿美元的基金。\n\n值得一提的是，在web2的成熟阶段，我们还看到一些新的平台试图取代巨头以更直接的订阅方式，更高的激励吸引创作者：\n\n* 今年大火的订阅通讯平台 Substack 作者会得到订阅收入的 90%；\n* 游戏直播平台 Twitch 的主播可得到 50% 的订阅费；\n* 内容创作平台 Patreon 的创作者能得到订阅费的 88% \\~ 95% ；\n* 内容订阅平台 OnlyFans 创作者能得到收入的 80% 。\n\n无论是第三方变现工具平台的兴起还是大厂实施针对中长尾和新兴创作者的激励，一个大趋势是——基于消费者对“新鲜好吃的蛋糕”的需求持续存在，创作者需要探索更丰富、更良性的内容变现路径从而制作出“更多更美味的蛋糕”，传统且单一的广告变现模式亟需被打破。我们看到创作者的机会在于除了广告，还可以通过销售优质内容、商品、辅导、咨询等方式赚钱。这让创作者专注于取悦他们最大的粉丝，并制作更多独特的利基内容，而不是拼命寻找尽可能多的受众，制作大众内容。\n\n这时或许有人会提出质疑，web2现有的内容生态是否可以通过温和的“反中心化”革命完成自我迭代？一定是web3的赋能才能营造更好的创作者生态吗？我们试图辩证地探讨，二者是零和竞争还是共赢并存的关系呢？\n\n对于这个问题我们尝试做一番猜想。Web2大厂的自我革命并不是想象中那么简单。有关用户偏好和行为的数据是平台最有价值的资产，因此大厂选择关闭了自己的生态系统并将用户锁定在他们的网络效应中，以积累他们专有的数据语料库。由于公司管理者得对股东和股价负责，部分放开数据权限已是他们能做的最大妥协。尽管大部分的用户对很多隐私和数据权利的事情并不真正放在心上，但是数据所有权背后的收益权才是最重要的。随着技术的不断迭代以及消费者和创作者认知的迭代，数据所有权的不公平分配必然会导致收益权分配不公平的问题。\n\n短期来看，web2和web3的内容生态不会是一个零和博弈的局面，更像是一个兼容并发的生态。毕竟目前Crypto用户的渗透率相比Web2来说还少很多。Web2大厂的温和革命和创新尝试不失为对web3加速进入用户认知的一种正向激励。而且我们认为，Web3模式带来的不仅是更公平的内容权力分配模式，更重要的是带来制作蛋糕的人——新的创作者。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BMiciBrzhjK6NfS1gdTzB.png?height=526&width=1020)\n\n# 3 创作者经济与 Web3 的下一个交叉点在哪里？\n\n第二部分我们讨论了在Web2时代隐私及数据收集、依赖广告收入的平台与用户需求之间的激励失衡、内容创新创作缺失等核心问题，导致了内容创作与传播的增长瓶颈。Web3到来让大众激动的一个原因在于——通过引入NFT还权于民，绕过平台，生产者直接链接消费者。在理想状态下，独立的内容创作者将不再受制于公司或平台的摆布，可以通过去中心化的平台或社区等方式发布自己的原创内容并获取收益。创作者经济包括有独立的内容创作者、创作团队和策划者等。它还由社区建设者以及旨在帮助这些创作者赚钱和发展的金融和软件工具等构成。\n\n## 3.1 Web3的引入带来内容生产和消费规则上的新玩法，新模式可能长什么样？\n\n在将作品代币化为 NFT 的过程中，创作者得以创建一条有关作品所有权和来源的*可验证链上记录*。这个过程最终将铸造出一种独一无二的资产 (NFT)，该资产可以追溯到该创作者。总体而言，我们希望所处的世界会从一个创作者需要依附于平台赚取收入，转变为他们可以依靠自己或者与社区一起创造财富。Web3对创作者经济产生的两个最显著的改变在于：\n\n1. 改变了利益分配机制（赋予使用者权利，攫取平台的利益给创作者/用户）；\n\n   区块链网络本身，只是一个“作品陈列馆”。创作者拥有并保留版权，可以将作品直接上传到公链完成商业化，没有中间商的环节来分取利润。创作者能够利用 NFT 创造各种各样的付费、与粉丝互动的方法。\n2. 改变了传统信任机制 （打破平台/公司边界，去中心化，数据权限发生改变）。\n\n   在web2时代我们依赖于知识产权法这个钝器对创作者及其版权进行保护，web3我们希望基于智能合约进行。数字资产从创建到消费都有了更好的权限保障，创作者将获得合理的利益分配和内容所属权力，同时规避各类版权起诉和盗版猖獗等问题。\n\n具体举例而言，创作者可以发行有“限定感”和“稀缺性”的专属NFT。对持有某个创作者的NFT，作为加入某个DAO的证明，可以用来表达和展示自我、确认彼此独特身份的“徽章”。在如下场景中创造价值：\n\n1. 赢取喜爱的乐队发行的NFT，可以获得来演出后台见面互动的机会；\n2. 为偶像氪金时获得NFT作为凭证，证明自己对idol的经济贡献；\n3. 在创作者初出茅庐时购买他们的NFT，能够在其未来走红后溢价卖出，获得内容投资“红利”等。\n\n我们畅想未来，也许两个追星发烧友见面之前就可以扫一扫彼此的二维码（或者以任何别的形式）看看对方收藏的NFT，了解他的兴趣和贡献。或者基于身份认同和内容消费观念，在共同的社区中劳动——创建内容，消费内容，投资内容。\n\n## 3.2 新模式的引入能否解决已有的创作者利益和内容权力分配不够公平的问题？\n\n1. 我们认为Web3的引入可以实现更公平的权力分配，还能实现平台（社区）共建的更多创作可能性。\n   1. 内容所有权：创作者的作品独立于平台而存在，不受平台强约束和限制。\n   2. 社群所有权：创作者与粉丝通过新型互动方式来建立直接交流的关系，粉丝群可来自于不同平台，不受平台中心化分发和分配。\n   3. 收入所有权：允许创作者铸造自己的创作者代币，创作者收入模型不由平台决定，也不只依赖于广告商或赞助商，可以由自己多元化定义。\n\n      内容被存储在公共数据库中。这给了创作者们和消费者们对于如何使用数据拥有了完全的灵活性，并意味着创作者与特定的平台不再像Web2时代一样有强依赖属性。例如去中心化的激励机制能够降低获客成本，创作者可以通过向忠实粉丝发行社交代币的激励方式提高用户粘性，甚至将版权的一部分收益权分配到社区，推动社区共创模式。市场透明度可赋予创作者调控市场的能力，让他们从依赖平台驱动的版权变现模式真正过渡到自己主导的变现模式。未来创作作品也可能成为社交入口，且在生命周期不同阶段展现多功能属性。\n2. 有助于实现创作者经济市场的风险和收益再平衡。“财富集中度越低，意味着潜在竞争对手挖走顶级创作者并威胁整个企业的风险就越小。”\n\n   内容创作者不再需要拥有数百万粉丝或者依附于大平台的流量保护来维持生计，有更多机会依靠少数充满热情的人的资助来生存。对创作者的作品充满热情的粉丝将愿意为这种权威的作品支付更多的钱，让创作者能够更好地捕捉粉丝的付费意愿。 比如，蓬勃发展的音乐 NFT 市场展示了这种效应。在流媒体平台上，一首流媒体音乐每播放一次都贡献相同的收入 (在 Spotify 上每首歌被付费账号播放一次产生 0.004 美元的版权费)，不管粉丝对歌手的热爱程度有多深。\n3. 平台不需要花费大量成本治理中长尾内容（非法和灰产内容）或者孵化扶持中长尾作者，各个社区的内容生态将会对自己负责。\n\n# 3.3 web3的模式带来能新增创作者进而带来新的创作内容？\n\n我们可以看到，Web3世界中，粉丝和创作者之间的界限日渐模糊，创作者的本质发生了明显变化。各类开发者、粉丝爱好者也可以被纳入内容创作的商业闭环，可以基于内容做更多的延伸（比如IP再创作、内容投资流通等）。拓展已有作品价值的同时，还通过更多商业玩法给创作者和消费者带来更多的利润分成。\n\n试想创作者二次增长的曲线是基于已有频道的活跃关注者辐射，以YouTube为例：\n\n* 全职创作者 (\\~200万+)\n  YouTube：在 YouTube 上的 3100 万个频道中，约 100 万个创作者拥有超过 1 万个订阅者\n  Instagram：在 Instagram 上的 10 亿个帐户中，约 50 万拥有超过 10 万的追随者，被认为是活跃的影响者\n  Twitch：在 Twitch 上的 300 万流媒体中，约 30万人拥有合作伙伴或附属身份\n  其他：包括音乐家、播客、作家、插画家等全职创作者总计约 20万\n* 业余创作者（\\~4670 万+）\n  YouTube：在 YouTube 上的 3100 万个频道中，约 1200 万个拥有 100-1 万的订阅者\n  Instagram：在 Instagram 上的 10 亿个帐户中，约 3000 万拥有 50-10 万粉丝\n  Twitch：在 Twitch 上的 300 万流媒体中，约 270 万不是合作伙伴或附属身份\n  其他：包括音乐家、播客、作家、插画家，预计总共约 200 万\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hYhbxbLB5m63Wd8iQk64o.png?height=570&width=1032)\n\n从上述模型我们可以合理预想，Web3时代\n\n1. 已有的创作者可以与他们的粉丝共同创作，新增创作内容；\n2. 内容消费者可以被纳入生产创作的闭环，成为新的内容创作者；\n3. 创作的内容循环模式可以被丰富：内容不仅被消费，也可以被投资。\n\n但凡每1个高质量的创作者辐射10个有影响力的粉丝协同创作，新增的创作者和内容都是指数级的增长。这可以通过引入 Tokens 来调节作者和粉丝的激励机制。\\*其中一个例子就是 Shibuya，\\*这是一个「允许用户参与、资助、投票表决结果并成为长篇内容的所有者的 Web3 视频平台」。其中的理念是，粉丝们可以购买一种称为 Producer Passes (制作人通行证) 的 NFT，并使用这些 NFT 通行证对动画剧集的情节和角色的决定进行投票。通过这样做，粉丝可以获得一个 $WRAB 代币，代表了对一个 NFT 系列的成比例的所有权。\n\n[The Quibbler](https://thequibbler.zhubai.love/) 最新一期 [Web3 如何影响创作者](https://thequibbler.zhubai.love/posts/2097264094846414848)通过对比 Web 2.0 和 Web 3.0 中不同的流量获取方式，来阐述 Web3 对于创作者的影响。引用一段：\n\n> “创作者的主要收益也不再是广告和平台补贴，而是前文提到的「钱」。这个「钱」由创作者制造并用于激励传播的同时自己也会保留一部分，但这个「钱」并不是类似我们日常使用的法币，而是更像是股票：如果你为创作者做了更多事情，例如分享他的作品，提出了有效的建议等，就可以获得这份「股票」，随着创作者的作品越来越受欢迎，未来能成为一个成功项目的概率逐渐变大，想要获得这个「股票」的人也会越来越多，这个「股票」的价格也会水涨船高，通过这种方式创建出更具凝聚力的粉丝社群。在这样的逻辑下，「股票」如何运转就成为了至关重要的一环，因而诞生了 Token Economics 这样的垂直领域，目标则是设计一个让「股票」健康运转的系统，这也是评估一个项目是否靠谱最重要的因素。”\n\n综上所述，Web2→Web3 为创作者经济带来的新特点：\n\n1. 新增创作者群体：\n   1. 分散权力到个体而非平台。即弱化中介，甚至去中介；\n   2. 不局限于生产力的大小，所有人都有机会通过兴趣和技能的付出赢得相应收益和关注度。\n2. 新增创作内容：\n   1. 新增的创作者带来新的内容；\n   2. 新增数字产品和虚拟服务等创作玩法。\n3. 优化创作者经济的商业模式：基于智能合约和Defi等加密技术的发展，创作者\n   1. 有更直接、多元化的变现方式；\n   2. 创造更有趣、多样的内容流通方式。\n\n# 4 值得一提的是，关于web3创作者经济发展以来的各种争议是难免的。\n\n从历史事件来看，2017年一大批区块链社交项目曾昙花一现（ONO、QunQun、GSC、YeeCall、NRC、SwagChain、火信、TTC Protocol相继推出）。但受早期加密市场、参与用户数量有限、生态模式局限性等问题，大多项目现在已经消失了。2020年，流动性流动性挖矿模式开始逐渐被内置于多种生态及模式中。在DeFi的加持之下，如今又涌现出一批主流的 SocialFi 概念项目，如Whale、Chilliz、RALLY、Fyooz、Zora等项目相继兴起。\n\n我们需要辩证地思考，基于 web3 打造的创作者经济市场究竟只是昙花一现还是切实的风口？而且什么时间点，或者说，什么拐点的到来和条件的满足会是爆发的前兆呢？\n\nweb2互联网和移动终端指数性增长浪潮的经验表明（带宽+移动互联网+4G baseon 大数据和生产资料的积累），一旦新技术的用户基础达到 10 亿，大规模市场应用程序的引力就会开始出现爆炸式增长。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3_MRO1l6qQexT4bQLNqlU.png?height=722&width=1072)\n\n相比之下，以太坊现在只有 1.8 亿个地址。以此作为 Web 3 普及的代表，按照目前的增长率，还需要 5 年才能达到 10 亿用户。\n\n由此我们认为，web3的创作者生态未能累计足够的链上非金融类的NFT数据和行为和信息以启动网络效应，因此并没到socialfi爆发的关键节点。\n\nWeb3与social的结合应用在实现上有什么阻碍？以及会不会带来新的问题？比如法律范畴下创作内容的所有权问题并未发展完善、去中心化与中心化平台之间的权衡等等问题都值得我们警惕。\n\n目前SocialFi正处于早期的发展阶段，大部分生态参与者主要以社交代币（Social Token）为基础，进行概念发散及技术更新，单独按SocialFi概念分类的平台较少，且部分项目与NFT、GameFi等概念存在交叉地带。围绕创作者经济的发展的闭环链路分析：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z1o0r9SAblwXnbiGoOI7k.png?height=186&width=1262)\n\n从原创内容和IP打造、内容的存储分发技术建设、社区传播和观众互动、商业变现的几个环节视角切分，我们更看好垂类环节的工具型产品，作为从web2迁移到web3的流量入口，比如支持创作或货币化的公司。比如说，开始一项付费博客业务，需要注册Substack，用Google Docs写作，用Figma制作（漂亮的）图形，用Stripe Atlas注册收款账户，用Mercury建立银行账户，在Descript上录制和编辑播客，在Anchor上发布，并在Twitter上宣传。这些公司共同专注于帮助创作者创建、发展、管理和盈利他们的受众。这一点非常重要，个体创作者能够进入商业闭环的必备工具在于他们能建立用户关系和分发内容，顺便获取收益的能力。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bTEwEEWJVcqtIOlEClmr-.png?height=722&width=1078)\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n在移动互联网的黄金十年里，我们生活在一个所有权集中在几中心化技术平台的时期，这些平台拥有数据、最终用户关系以及分发和货币化内容的手段。虽然内容创作在此期间呈爆炸式增长，但它也导致绝大多数创作者对中心化平台的依赖、信息茧房的困境、以及创新创作的倦怠。\n\n创作者领域不平等的根本原因是平台通过对生产方式和内容分发的所有权对创作者及其作品施加的过度控制。挑战这种控制的最直接方式是改变谁拥有生产资料。幸运的是，我们看到web3的出现或许能推动权力的天平转向创作者。\n\nWeb3 的创作者生态已经初具雏形，无论是依托于区块链、NFT 底层经济体系还是平台内自建货币体系。创作者可以利用生态工具完成内容生产，并通过平台、交易市场、社群等渠道完成收益变现。但究竟哪些创新才能真正为创作者提供价值，还需要漫长的求索和试错。我们相信 web3 有潜力为每个在互联网上做出贡献和创造的人带来难以置信的机会：这是我们一直期待的真正内容创作的黄金时代。\n\n引用IPFS协议创始人在DLD国际大会上的讲话，\n\n> “Web3.0会在未来几年的时间（实现），如果要定一个时间，5年或者10年，但现在Web3.0运动已经开始了。”\n\n## Works

{"id": "NPGbcGXiqTbrEVWs0JyWeO6JJON-zgQVhcVluO62RC0", "title": "Thoughts sharing on the emerging \"Asset Management as a Service\" market", "body": "As of May 24th 2022, the last weeks have been a roller-coaster for the crypto & stock market and confirming the entrance into the bear territory: from the “algorithmic stable coin” UST losing its 1:1 peg and LUNA freefalling from $100 to $0.01, to BTC plunging below $30K, or more recently, [the Coinbase Q1FY22 report](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001679788/89c60d81-41a2-4a3c-86fb-b4067ab1016c.pdf) stating that users’ funds could be wiped out under a bankruptcy event scenario. These headlines have been the caviar of the breaking news, Twitter, LinkedIn, and even Instagram. I haven’t heard anyone from my IRL/online network speaking, or complaining, about this drop in the last weeks.\n\nThe current state of the global economy and the endless news related to the crypto market has motivated me to finalize the draft of this article and share my thoughts on the emerging segment within FinTech that I call “ Asset Management as a Service”.\n\n### Definition & Introduction\n\nI discovered this new segment a few months ago while I was mingling between Discord groups to get deals data – jumping in a brief chat with a user, which seems to be financially literate, leads to the asset diversification in the crypto space debate and my first introduction to “Asset Management as a Service”. I could define   “Asset Management as a Service \" as the way to manage and invest clients/LPs’ funds without the need to have ownership and total access and/or control over the financial assets. On the opposite of the traditional approach, where Clients/LPs give up ownership and full control of their funds over a fixed time. It leverages multiple technologies like APIs, AI/ML, and blockchain to disrupt the legacy Asset Management.\n\nAfter a quick research, the recent data and metrics related to Asset Management blow my mind: this juicy industry [sized $103 trillion in 2021](https://web-assets.bcg.com/79/bf/d1d361854084a9624a0cbce3bf07/bcg-global-asset-management-2021-jul-2021.pdf), and retail portfolios represented 41% of global assets, or $42 trillion according to BCG. The global crypto trend & pandemic have largely contributed to the spike in interest of retail investors for investment products, the US equity trading activity [has doubled since the beginning of the pandemic](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-new-way-to-look-at-retail-trading-trends) according to Nasdaq data, rising from around $18 billion/day (pre-2020) to around $32 billion/day in March 2020. Parallelly, the number of crypto owners expects to grow from [295 million to 1 billion](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hfgyig42jimx/5i8TeN1QYJDjn82pSuZB5S/85c7c9393f3ee67e456ec780f9bf11e3/Cryptodotcom_Crypto_Market_Sizing_Jan2022.pdf) by the end of 2022. Additionally, the metrics from some companies operating in this space raised my attention to further dive in, like Kryll.io which managed to reach [+$3.5 billion traded volumes in April 2022](https://blog.kryll.io/kryll-changelog-monthly-progress-report-april-2022-metrics/), and the marketplace is operating/used across 112 countries. Or Zignaly, the profit-sharing/copy-trading platform gathers +55K users and manages +$60M AUM through API-linked crypto trading accounts.\n\n### The Market Drivers\n\nAlthough the industry has seen some innovation over the past decade, it still remains fundamentally conservative given the nature of the business. In my opinion, the structural changes and new technology applied to finance will be key drivers of the emergence of the “Asset Management-as-a-Service”:\n\n* First and foremost, the global population is getting more educated about the Financial Market and the basics of Personal Finance. The multiplication of trading apps, like Binance or RobinHood, and neo-banking offering stock or crypto investing product illustrates the willingness of this new generation to keep full control and ownership over their financial assets. According to [The Motley Fool survey 2021](https://www.fool.com/research/what-are-gen-z-millennial-investors-buying/), 73% of Gen Z investors, and 66% of millennial investors own stocks, and unsurprisingly, 40% of stock investors aged 18 to 40 own cryptocurrencies, which demonstrates a genuine interest in the financial industry. Charles Swab talks now about the [“Generation I(nvestor)”.](https://www.aboutschwab.com/generation-investor-study-2021)\n* The decentralization of Investment Management knowledge outside of the banking/hedge fund space and the growing individual/independent investor community across social networks has largely participated in the disruption of the Asset Management landscape. The episode [Reddit’s traders vs HFs](https://www.ft.com/content/7a91e3ea-b9ec-4611-9a03-a8dd3b8bddb5), or the [anonymous Twitter user explaining step by step how to break Terra](https://twitter.com/FreddieRaynolds/status/1463960623402913797) in Nov. 2022,  illustrates the capacity of some retail investors to research/act like a \"professional\" investor. The community aspect and knowledge sharing play a big role in the evolution of the Asset Management industry: favoriting the \"multiplayer\" and \"community-belonging\" sentiment that leads to higher engagement. Additionally, the multiple FinMeme/StockMeme accounts on Instagram & Twitter gathering several millions of followers genuinely outline the exponential factor of Community in the global financial industry. A16Z addresses better the community-first social investing topic in the \"[Big ideas that fintech will tackle in 2022](https://a16z.com/2021/12/20/the-big-ideas-that-fintech-will-tackle-in-2022/#:\\~:text=In%202022%2C%20we'll%20see,fiat%20and%20crypto%20financial%20lives)” post.\n* Aforementioned above, trading platforms blossoming over the past years have upside down the traditional investing/trading market by granting commission-free, low-capital access, and fractional shares trading. The consumerization of the financial market and the democratization of retail investing activities play a subsequent stake in the emergence of the Asset Management-as-a-Service space, as well as, participating in the popularization of new investment instruments, like NFT or cryptocurrencies. Technical innovations applied to Financial Services – like API, Blockchain, Bots, or AI/ML – are the drivers of this new market. Quantitative/algorithmic investment strategies are getting more traction within the stock market in the past years (e.g. Two Sigma, Renaissance Technologies…), and automation has become a norm in the Finance industry. APIs can allow anyone to manage your brokerage/trading account with specific restrictions, Blockchain – especially smart contracts – acts as a safeguard/trusted-third party, and bots automize investment strategies while minimizing cognitive biases. Venture investments have started to hit the space, and startups have begun to stand out, such as the US-company Alpaca building a developer-first API for stock/crypto trading that secured [+$70M from VC firms](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/alpaca-raises-50m-to-rapidly-scale-its-equities-trading-api-business/), or Zignaly developing a profit-sharing based copy-trading platform for digital assets raised +$50M.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads me to think of a future where people would easily access  \"Plug'n'Play\" alpha-generating services within a few clicks, and anyone would be able to start \"independent\" Asset Management activities with enterprise-grade tools/ infrastructures.\n\n### Applications\n\nFrom my investigation, the Asset Management-as-a-Service landscape is growing over the days and attracting more retail and institutional investors. Applications within this space include: marketplaces matching Asset Managers & customers, create/rent/sell/buy investment strategies, NFT-based Asset Management, DAO, wallet-2-wallet following, API-based trading infrastructure, and enterprise-grade tools for retail investors/independent Asset Managers.

{"id": "_osl8XEpn6L9whaneQuAVwrQ4PtH9-I9sJ-d7HiSfy8", "title": "O que são NFTs?", "body": "## Definição\n\nA tecnologia dos NFTs, **Non-Fungible Tokens**, foi creada em 2017 através de contratos inteligentes na blockchain Ethereum. No início de 2021, os NFTs entram de repente em destaque no mundo das criptomoedas e tecnologia subjacente (blockchain).\n\nUm NFT é um tipo de token. **Mas o que são tokens?**\n\n**Tokens** são unidades virtuais que confirmam a posse de certo activo digital. Os tokens operam com base na tecnologia blockchain, aquela que está na base das criptomoedas. Para entender melhor os conceitos **blockchain** e **criptomoeda**, recomendo a leitura deste artigo:\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x2DBF911D78815D995B05bc8FA42e378f78D7CC7b/0vQjECsvCIYUAkSbXuKWo3Jncbsg3ZiaaS0-2fraLnQ](https://mirror.xyz/0x2DBF911D78815D995B05bc8FA42e378f78D7CC7b/0vQjECsvCIYUAkSbXuKWo3Jncbsg3ZiaaS0-2fraLnQ)\n\nEntre todos os tokens existentes (mais de 13 000 neste momento - o site [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) chama-os todos de ‘Coins’, mas na realidade só alguns são moedas) há alguns que se chamam moedas. Uma moeda, ou criptomoeda, é semelhante a uma moeda física, e é um token nativo de certa blockchain. Cada blockchain só tem uma moeda, mas pode ter vários tokens. As moedas tipicamente têm o mesmo nome da blockchain onde operam. Por exemplo, [SOLANA](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana) (SOL) é a moeda da blockchain Solana, e [SOLCIAL](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solcial) (SLCL) é um token que opera nessa mesma blockchain. Por exemplo, [ETHEREUM ou ETHER](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum) (ETH) é a moeda da blockchain Ethereum, e [BASIC ATTENTION TOKEN](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/basic-attention-token) (BAT) é um token que opera nessa mesma blockchain. Note-se que tokens que não sejam nativos, i.e não sejam moedas, podem existir em várias blockchains, como é o caso do BAT (tal facto está indicado no campo ‘Contract’, menu **…**, em **Info** - ver link acima).\n\nOs portadores de tokens podem, além de os guardar nas suas carteiras digitais, trocá-los por outros tokens em casas de cambio online, vendê-los (NFTs) em *marketplaces*, oferecê-los, ou usá-los para comprar algo. Existem vários tipos de tokens, entre os quais destaco:\n\n* **Pagamento** – usado para efectuar transações financeiras no mundo digital (moedas como Solana, Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum).\n* **Utilitário** – usado para dar acesso a produtos ou serviços baseados em alguma blockchain.\n\n  Todos os tipos anteriores são **fungíveis** (*fungible tokens*), ou seja, podem ser trocados por algo de valor igual – 1 Bitcoin na mão da pessoa A vale o mesmo que 1 Bitcoin na mão da pessoa B, ou seja, se as pessoas trocarem as moedas o cenário não se altera. Tal não se passa com os NFTs, pois cada um é único. Diz-se por isso que são **não-fungíveis**.\n* **NFT** – certificados digitais únicos de trabalhos originais, onde o criador original terá sempre controlo sobre a forma como o trabalho é licensiado. São compostos por vários elementos, tais como:\n  * **conteúdo digital** que representa – ficheiro de imagem, audio, texto, ou vídeo.\n  * **criador** – identificação do criador do token.\n  * **proprietário** – identificação do actual proprietário do token, o qual será ainda o criador se o token não tiver sido oferecido ou vendido.\n  * **preço ou ofertas**, caso esteja à venda ou em leilão.\n  * **metadados** – informações sobre o activo digital, como assinatura do criador, descrição, tipo de ficheiro, resolução, histórico de transações, data e hora da sua criação, …\n\nOutra diferença entre **NFTs** e tokens fungíveis (como moedas, por exemplo) é a **indivisibilidade** dos primeiros. Por exemplo, poderás enviar 0.05 Bitcoins a um amigo, mas não poderás fazer o mesmo com 5% de um NFT.\n\n## Valor\n\nSe todos os criadores digitais publicarem os seus novos trabalhos, originais, como NFT, todo aquele que tentar copiar o seu trabalho e certificá-lo como NFT, muito dificilmente terá o seu trabalho reconhecido como original. Isto porque existem mecanismos (e cada vez existirão mais) para saber se certo conteúdo digital já foi publicado mais que uma vez na web como NFT (e.g, vários marketplaces fazem essa fiscalização, em breve existirão **motores de busca de NFTs** – ver websites em baixo, e poderás usar o [motor de busca da Google](https://images.google.com/) para saber a localização de certo ficheiro de imagem).\n\n[https://nftsearch.site/](https://nftsearch.site/)\n\n**Nota**: *se ainda não existir na base de dados, deverás/poderás adicionar o NFT que procuras à mesma*.\n\n[https://hebys.io/](https://hebys.io/)\n\n[https://nftlab.com/](https://nftlab.com/)\n\n[https://nooft.io/](https://nooft.io/)\n\nRegra geral, é possível salvar ou copiar o conteúdo digital de um NFT, seja uma imagem, vídeo, áudio ou documento, mas nunca será possível copiar o NFT. Esse terá sempre um único proprietário. Uma pessoa que crie um NFT com base na cópia  (ficheiro, screenshot) do conteúdo digital de outro NFT, terá sempre em sua posse um NFT distinto, publicado em data posterior à do original.\n\n> *Markets for traditional art and collectibles are thriving despite forgeries, and the issue is even smaller with NFTs* ([ref](https://archive.ph/ptRTw))\n\nOs NFTs podem ser programados para permitir ao criador/autor arrecadar dinheiro sempre que o NFT for vendido, normalmente entre 2.5% a 10% do preço de venda.\n\n## Como Criar e Comercializar?\n\nQualquer pessoa pode criar algo digitalmente, transformá-lo num NFT em alguma blockchain (processo chamado ‘Minting’ em Inglês), e colocar esse token para venda em algum *marketplace* online. Alguns locais cobram para publiar os teus NFTs. Qualquer marketplace cobra uma taxa do valor de venda de cada NFT, a qual poderá ser suportada pelo comprador ou pelo vendedor, dependendo da plataforma.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GGvxJ9xOJMs4wmx6mBN0S.png?height=530&width=1127)\n\nDe modo a poderes comprar um NFT, precisarás de dispor na tua carteira digital da criptomoeda associada à blockchain onde o token está alojado.\n\n### Marketplaces\n\n[https://support.exodus.com/article/1663-nft-gallery#nft-gallery](https://support.exodus.com/article/1663-nft-gallery#nft-gallery)\n\n[https://rarible.com/](https://rarible.com/)\n\n[https://www.mintbase.io/](https://www.mintbase.io/)\n\n[https://www.higgsfield.io/](https://www.higgsfield.io/)\n\n[https://apollo42.app/](https://apollo42.app/)\n\n[https://galacticway.io/](https://galacticway.io/)\n\n[https://www.gem.xyz/](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n[https://www.genesishouse.io/](https://www.genesishouse.io/)\n\n[https://makersplace.com/](https://makersplace.com/)\n\n[https://digitaleyes.market/](https://digitaleyes.market/)\n\n[https://zora.co/](https://zora.co/)\n\n[https://kalamint.io/](https://kalamint.io/)\n\n[https://solsea.io/](https://solsea.io/)\n\n[https://mintable.app/](https://mintable.app/)\n\n## Referências\n\n[https://archive.ph/NlxxB](https://archive.ph/NlxxB)\n\n[https://archive.ph/oKR8W](https://archive.ph/oKR8W)\n\n[https://archive.ph/AWjJO](https://archive.ph/AWjJO)\n\n[https://archive.ph/vKltQ](https://archive.ph/vKltQ)\n\n[https://archive.ph/BYYKv](https://archive.ph/BYYKv)\n\n[https://archive.ph/xvBDn](https://archive.ph/xvBDn)\n\n[https://archive.ph/C4Sbu](https://archive.ph/C4Sbu)\n\n[https://archive.ph/1hOCp](https://archive.ph/1hOCp)\n\n[https://archive.ph/Z4UkZ](https://archive.ph/Z4UkZ)\n\n[https://archive.ph/pIeKl](https://archive.ph/pIeKl)\n\n[https://archive.ph/O7zOR](https://archive.ph/O7zOR)\n\n[https://archive.ph/3gqjg](https://archive.ph/3gqjg)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653388431, "digest": "ZlWGomlkZpIdsKHll84TGQDgKfC_SWuB_UaVYFDYoQU", "contributor": "0x2DBF911D78815D995B05bc8FA42e378f78D7CC7b"}
{"id": "bdzeaWILajDkz_g9zJxe9N6-Eaz36gamDLsEw1FXWkg", "title": "Thoughts sharing on the emerging \"Asset Management as a Service\" market", "body": "As of May 24th 2022, the last weeks have been a roller-coaster for the crypto & stock market and confirming the entrance into the bear territory: from the “algorithmic stable coin” UST losing its 1:1 peg and LUNA freefalling from $100 to $0.01, to BTC plunging below $30K, or more recently, [the Coinbase Q1FY22 report](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001679788/89c60d81-41a2-4a3c-86fb-b4067ab1016c.pdf) stating that users’ funds could be wiped out under a bankruptcy event scenario. These headlines have been the caviar of the breaking news, Twitter, LinkedIn, and even Instagram. I haven’t heard anyone from my IRL/online network speaking, or complaining, about this drop in the last weeks.\n\nThe current state of the global economy and the endless news related to the crypto market has motivated me to finalize the draft of this article and share my thoughts on the emerging segment within FinTech that I call “ Asset Management as a Service”.\n\n### Definition & Introduction\n\nI discovered this new segment a few months ago while I was mingling between Discord groups to get deals data – jumping in a brief chat with a user, which seems to be financially literate, leads to the asset diversification in the crypto space debate and my first introduction to “Asset Management as a Service”. I could define it as the way to manage and invest clients/LPs’ funds without the need to have ownership and total access and/or control over the financial assets. On the opposite of the traditional approach, where Clients/LPs give up ownership and full control of their funds over a fixed time. It leverages multiple technologies like APIs, AI/ML, and blockchain to disrupt the legacy Asset Management.\n\nAfter a quick research, the recent data and metrics related to Asset Management blow my mind: this juicy industry [sized $103 trillion in 2021](https://web-assets.bcg.com/79/bf/d1d361854084a9624a0cbce3bf07/bcg-global-asset-management-2021-jul-2021.pdf), and retail portfolios represented 41% of global assets, or $42 trillion according to BCG. The global crypto trend & pandemic have largely contributed to the spike in interest of retail investors for investment products, the US equity trading activity [has doubled since the beginning of the pandemic](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-new-way-to-look-at-retail-trading-trends) according to Nasdaq data, rising from around $18 billion/day (pre-2020) to around $32 billion/day in March 2020. Parallelly, the number of crypto owners expects to grow from [295 million to 1 billion](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hfgyig42jimx/5i8TeN1QYJDjn82pSuZB5S/85c7c9393f3ee67e456ec780f9bf11e3/Cryptodotcom_Crypto_Market_Sizing_Jan2022.pdf) by the end of 2022. Additionally, the metrics from some companies operating in this space raised my attention to further dive in, like Kryll.io which managed to reach [+$3.5 billion traded volumes in April 2022](https://blog.kryll.io/kryll-changelog-monthly-progress-report-april-2022-metrics/), and the marketplace is operating/used across 112 countries. Or Zignaly, the profit-sharing/copy-trading platform gathers +55K users and manages +$60M AUM through API-linked crypto trading accounts.\n\n### The Market Drivers\n\nAlthough the industry has seen some innovation over the past decade, it still remains fundamentally conservative given the nature of the business. In my opinion, the structural changes and new technology applied to finance will be key drivers of the emergence of the “Asset Management-as-a-Service”:\n\n* First and foremost, the global population is getting more educated about the Financial Market and the basics of Personal Finance. The multiplication of trading apps, like Binance or RobinHood, and neo-banking offering stock or crypto investing product illustrates the willingness of this new generation to keep full control and ownership over their financial assets. According to [The Motley Fool survey 2021](https://www.fool.com/research/what-are-gen-z-millennial-investors-buying/), 73% of Gen Z investors, and 66% of millennial investors own stocks, and unsurprisingly, 40% of stock investors aged 18 to 40 own cryptocurrencies, which demonstrates a genuine interest in the financial industry. Charles Swab talks now about the [“Generation I(nvestor)”.](https://www.aboutschwab.com/generation-investor-study-2021)\n* The decentralization of Investment Management knowledge outside of the banking/hedge fund space and the growing individual/independent investor community across social networks has largely participated in the disruption of the Asset Management landscape. The episode [Reddit’s traders vs HFs](https://www.ft.com/content/7a91e3ea-b9ec-4611-9a03-a8dd3b8bddb5), or the [anonymous Twitter user explaining step by step how to break Terra](https://twitter.com/FreddieRaynolds/status/1463960623402913797) in Nov. 2022,  illustrates the capacity of some retail investors to research/act like a \"professional\" investor. The community aspect and knowledge sharing play a big role in the evolution of the Asset Management industry: favoriting the \"multiplayer\" and \"community-belonging\" sentiment that leads to higher engagement. Additionally, the multiple FinMeme/StockMeme accounts on Instagram & Twitter gathering several millions of followers genuinely outline the exponential factor of Community in the global financial industry. A16Z addresses better the community-first social investing topic in the \"[Big ideas that fintech will tackle in 2022](https://a16z.com/2021/12/20/the-big-ideas-that-fintech-will-tackle-in-2022/#:\\~:text=In%202022%2C%20we'll%20see,fiat%20and%20crypto%20financial%20lives)” post.\n* Aforementioned above, trading platforms blossoming over the past years have upside down the traditional investing/trading market by granting commission-free, low-capital access, and fractional shares trading. The consumerization of the financial market and the democratization of retail investing activities play a subsequent stake in the emergence of the “Asset Management as a Service” space, as well as, participating in the popularization of new investment instruments, like NFT or cryptocurrencies. Technical innovations applied to Financial Services – like API, Blockchain, Bots, or AI/ML – are the drivers of this new market. Quantitative/algorithmic investment strategies are getting more traction within the stock market in the past years (e.g. Two Sigma, Renaissance Technologies…), and automation has become a norm in the Finance industry. APIs can allow anyone to manage your brokerage/trading account with specific restrictions, Blockchain – especially smart contracts – acts as a safeguard/trusted-third party, and bots automize investment strategies while minimizing cognitive biases. Venture investments have started to hit the space, and startups have begun to stand out, such as the US-company Alpaca building a developer-first API for stock/crypto trading that secured [+$70M from VC firms](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/alpaca-raises-50m-to-rapidly-scale-its-equities-trading-api-business/), or Zignaly developing a profit-sharing based copy-trading platform for digital assets raised +$50M.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads me to think of a future where people would easily access  \"Plug'n'Play\" alpha-generating services within a few clicks, and anyone would be able to start \"independent\" Asset Management activities with enterprise-grade tools/ infrastructures.\n\n### Applications\n\nFrom my investigation, the “Asset Management as a Service” landscape is growing over the days and attracting more retail and institutional investors. Applications within this space include: marketplaces matching Asset Managers & customers, create/rent/sell/buy investment strategies, NFT-based Asset Management, DAO, wallet-2-wallet following, API-based trading infrastructure, and enterprise-grade tools for retail investors/independent Asset Managers.

{"id": "xN6MKX1xUux-CwqjNEBzvZjwB7w01Q_sFyolBogp2Y4", "title": "The Big Bang: StellarsDAO on a Mission to Harness the Digital Art Revolution", "body": "![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jyr82AUDiKJfW9JDgAIMO.png?height=927&width=4036&size=large)\n\nStellarsDAO is a community of collectors focused on acquiring stellar✨ pieces of generative art. Through that fundamental mission, we aim to build a community of like-minded collectors, support up-and-coming artists and onboard traditional art collectors into the world of digital collectables.\n\n## The context\n\nWe believe that generative art is fundamentally changing the art world in profound and lasting ways. Not only do we have long-form generative art pieces that redefined the very basic ideas of what constitutes a work of art, but the rise of NFT-based art is also fundamentally transforming the art market. The wave of democratization and reformation is only beginning. \n\nStellarsDAO aims to play a significant role in this transformation by actively participating in making on-chain art accessible to everyone. \n\n![Image source: https://linesmag.com/the-mona-lisa-is-moving-out/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EZEl6RElf7Or2Je5Hjf2z.png?height=780&width=1170&size=medium)\n\n## Why we are so excited about generative art\n\n### Traditional art\n\nArt can be beautiful, moving and inspiring. It can challenge prejudices, and be thought-provoking. Art can change lives. Some of it will stand the test of time, and many pieces will become icons and symbols of different eras in human history. \n\nHowever, access to art, both as a creator and collector, is traditionally very limited and all but democratic. The artworld is controlled by a small number of high profile players that decide not only what is valuable, but what should be considered art at all.\n\nTraditional physical art is usually surrounded by secrecy; it is opaque. Deals are done behind closed doors: no one knows who owns it or how many pieces an artist has made and will make in the future. There is a forgery. You’re dealing with logistics and coping with the extremely high cost of keeping art in good condition. Security concerns. Zero liquidity.\n\nThe current art system is very exclusive. All power is in the hands of a small group of high profile individuals and galleries/auction houses.\n\n### Generative art\n\nAs opposed to that, generative digital art is open and democratic. It is all on-chain (meaning you can easily trace it, since the moment it was created) and transparent. We know when each piece/collection was created, who were the owners and the price paid. There are no logistic issues. Traceable all the time.\n\nIt builds on top of amazing new technology. It is innovative, with huge new avenues to create unconstrained by physical elements. It’s accessible. It’s rewarding.\n\nThere is an alignment between artists, platforms, and collectors. Huge network effects push it forward and reinforce a positive cycle. \n\nGenerative art has the ability to become essential to the digital-first world we are living in. As the digital presence of individuals became more valuable, so did the digital assets.\n\n![Autoglyphs by Larva Labs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MCYSduzybx44g5AIFXiuP.png?height=764&width=2880&size=large)\n\n## The opportunity\n\nAs one of our close friends likes to say — we’re entering the digital renaissance era, and it’s only the beginning. \n\nGenerative art is in its very early stages. While the idea and concept of procedural and instruction-based artworks go back decades, the rise of NFTs has given this movement unprecedented momentum.\n\nWhile very few collections and artists have yet earned blue-chip status, the majority of long-form generative collections are still obscure. Curation in the space is comparatively low, and with dozens of new artists entering the scene weekly, assessment of quality and value is nearly impossible for outsiders.\n\nThe StellarsDAO team has been part of the generative art revolution from day one. We have established strong connections within the community and keep close contact with artists, curators and collectors. This allows us to identify high potential pieces and artists early and establish a truly meaningful collection of relevant generative art to care for and pass down through generations.\n\n![Screens #923 by Thomas Lin Pedersen owned by StellarsDAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QEkfLqUKdv9m-_eR1BL2U.png?height=2731&width=4096&size=medium)\n\n## How we think\n\n### Frameworks\n\nBy using frameworks from traditional markets, as well as a disciplined and structured approach to acquisition research, we maximize the reach and value of our collection and generate sustainable long term results.\n\nThat said, it is all about art. We work hard to gather the most amazing, beautiful, thought-provoking pieces of digital art from hugely talented individuals, whose journey we plan to follow in the long run.\n\nTake a look at this Twitter thread about one of the acquisitions we published, to get an idea about our process:\n\n[https://twitter.com/stellarsdao/status/1524669415286984705?s=20&t=wbNaXCDWe8zjRvB0P7ieew](https://twitter.com/stellarsdao/status/1524669415286984705?s=20&t=wbNaXCDWe8zjRvB0P7ieew)\n\n### Collection structure\n\nWe aim to create a balanced collection containing “blue chip” pieces, established artists and upcoming talents. To achieve this, we carefully research each acquisition and work closely with artists, curation platforms and our community.\n\n**Our collection contains pieces from the following categories:**\n\n1. Blue-chip generative art\n2. Curated collections\n3. Up-and-coming artists\n\nWhen we invest in a collection, we work closely with the artist to ensure choosing the right pieces. We aim to collect a meaningful number of interesting and defining pieces for each collection we collect, based both on rarities and aesthetic/conceptional significance. An assemblage of art pieces which will stand the test of time, and be really meaningful and representative of the digital world our generation is creating.\n\nSo far, our portfolio consists of a few collections we’re very familiar with. It’s being slowly updated [on our website](https://stellarsdao.com/collection/). You can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stellarsdao) to get more frequent updates.\n\n## Our future\n\nWhen we began working on our DAO we didn’t think we will be able to raise a considerable amount to be able to make any difference in the space. Embarrassing to say, but our technology stack doesn’t exist. We’re still using no-code tools to run the DAO.\n\nOur initial roadmap was very vague: we knew we’d like to build something on top of our DAO and we realised that it was probably going to be just a passion project rather than something serious. Our vision was clear though — bring more people into generative art, make it more accessible and collect some beautiful historically significant art by some of our favourite artists along the way.\n\nWith more and more investors joining us before we even had Twitter up, we realised that we might be onto something. We might *actually* build something great and make a difference. \n\n**The best part of it all — is we can do it together.**\n\nAt the moment we’re working on finalising our internal structure. We’re chatting to and modelling other renowned DAOs in the space to make our DAO as transparent as it can be. The majority of funds from our initial capital raised from private investors is going towards acquiring generative art. Our primary goal is to build the most significant and stellar✨ generative art collection by renowned artists.\n\n**The rest is up to you.** \n\nWe’d like to invite the best builders, the most sophisticated thinkers and the most proactive doers to the DAO. We want to enable you to create towards our shared goal. If you feel like our mission is something worth contributing to — we invite you to join us on this journey. \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hs6iD_0BekXTfFb46itT1.png?height=1200&width=1200)\n\n## How to join\n\nOur [website](https://stellarsdao.com/) is live now as well as the [membership sale](https://stellarsdao.com/join/).\n\nThe price of the membership token is 1 ETH, the supply is capped at 1,000. At the time of writing this, we managed to sell 117 passes and build a solid treasury of generative art (we continue our acquisitions). \n\nOnce you purchase a membership, you will get access to a private section in our Discord. As a member of our DAO, you will be able to suggest the changes and vote for the available treasury resources allocation for the long-term growth and prosperity of the DAO project.\n\nWe’re currently building our core members’ structure, so if you’d like to be involved from the beginning — we’d love to welcome you.", "timestamp": 1653388776, "digest": "w-Iji6KBvoJs7gJgwKddZf6wdwyieDidPBkwefXMvvk", "contributor": "0x9a874B1f2c381Ad85F1440e0C71a29008b4D6883"}

Web2 has instigated a pandemic of loneliness. Despite its promises of bringing the world together through the co-creation of stories and sharing of worlds, Internet users report feeling greater isolation while spending more time online than ever before. Where is the human connection?\n2. Web2 has unleashed digital creators, but still fails to let them own the social capital they earn. Individuals could make content, grow audiences, and become globally influential brands by the strength of their YouTube subscribers or Instagram followers. But can they make enduring art with the communities they build?\n3. Web2 has promised democratisation of decision-making: the inclusion of more voices, broad participation by the masses. Yet, due to contradictory market incentives, open platforms regularly degenerate into polarised arguments, uncontrolled spam, and pits of misinformation. Why has civic community, built atop collaboration, gone missing?\n\nIn essence, Web2 lacks the social bonds, the reliable professional networks, and the collective artistry needed to consistently produce great stories — stories that grace our screens, appeal to diverse audiences and reward the creators who make them. Historically, there were few, if any, ways for interested supporters to participate in the value chain of such creative endeavors, *until Web3 came along*.\n\n### Mecenia: A Creative Republic in the Metaverse\n\n![Founding Memo of the Creative Republic of Mecenia](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YUeKrtz4hOxGrZh1gJeur.png?height=1080&width=1920&&size=medium)\n\nMecenia’s main economic activities revolve around the production and exportation of media properties. We offer a Web3-native media ecosystem to source IPs, organise creators, rally supporters, and deliver creative works such as films and video games. It is a vehicle to mobilise funding for promising projects, while rewarding all parties for holding a stake in this community.\n\nThe Internet once promised human connection, equal opportunity and democratic participation. Mecenia restores hope to this vision. By connecting creative stakeholders through Web3 protocols, we empower all who join to collectively *fund, decide, and make.*\n\n### We must reassemble the stakeholders of our media ecosystem\n\nTo get from good ideas to “*media that change the world*”, Mecenia will pull together all these stakeholders into a new equilibrium:\n\n1. *Creators* care about their craft. With Mecenia’s support, creators everywhere stand a chance at turning creative concepts into a broader media property with extended appeal;\n2. *Supporters* want to go beyond passively consuming content to contributing to its creative direction. Mecenia gives them a vehicle to invest in the content they care about—and in return, they help to guide and accelerate its creation. Ultimately, by participating in this creative process, a larger community is formed around the media IP, the characters, and the stories they live in;\n3. *A Decision-Making Platform* is needed to structure choices about where to allocate resources and which projects to fund, and ultimately to put it to a binding vote. Mecenia addresses this through the *Legislature*, a DAO where decisions are queried and set by the collective. The *Legislatur*e then needs the support of a dedicated *Executive Team*. We keep the *Legislators* informed, organise the decisions put in front of them, and execute those decisions once they are made. This converts decisions from “sentiments” into “actions” in the real world;\n4. *Distribution Channels.* Once projects are completed, we need channels that distribute these works to a wider audience. As Mecenia exports its creative outputs beyond the Metaverse, the new and old Internet can productively interface. Content from our Web3 ecosystem can still leverage existing Web2 social media, as well as streaming and app store platforms to propagate and grow.\n\n![Logos are for illustrative purposes only. Or not. You get to decide.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9kDevdJ0bw7kcxyIFJNhC.png?height=1080&width=1920&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n\n---\n\n## Let us unite in creativity\n\nMedia properties—whether a great film, a viral mobile game or new creations within the *Metaverse*—are never made by a single person alone.\n\n*Creativity is a team sport.*\n\nBy reimagining this media ecosystem, Mecenia effectively acts as a *Creative Republic*, where new and established *Creators* can pitch projects, obtain funding from *Supporters*, and then work with trusted producers and teams to deliver creative outputs. As a vehicle for mobilising capital and artistry, Mecenia enables the scaling of promising ideas into successful, innovative and beloved media properties. These properties can manifest as artworks, films, comics, games, consumer products, and more—and all are linked back to the investments made by our Creative Republic.\n\nThe civic groups that make up Mecenia reflect the diversity of human stories in the real world—bringing together talented creators ready to sketch, storyboard, animate, and chronicle these narratives, with supporters eager to accompany them on that journey.\n\nEveryone has a part to play in forging our Creative Republic. Each inhabitant of Mecenia helps make real the projects that live in our hearts. With our hands, our votes, and our words—all coming together in Mecenia, in ways great and small—we ignite a more wondrous and creative world.\n\n\n---\n\n## The DAO shall have 1,000 seats\n\nTogether we are the ***Legislature*** - the *collective* that guides Mecenia through the noise and distraction.\n\nTogether we select which ideas should be made into world-changing films and video games.\n\nTogether we share the fruits of our labour.\n\n### We shall release 1,000 Legislature NFTs (ERC721)\n\nEach *Legislature NFT* represents a parliamentary seat in Mecenia.\n\nHolding a *Legislature NFT* empowers you to:\n\n* Vote on projects presented to Mecenia;\n* Earn a percentage of Mecenia's profits;\n* Enjoy priority consideration for your NFTs to be adapted by our creators;\n* Access our private Discord - '*The Parliament*' for high-quality research on NFT projects and IP potential;\n* Participate in our virtual and IRL events, masterclasses, art drops and other exclusive collaborations with our creators.\n\n![Our promise to you](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/doF2fSRDEzAxWjzaP1UnR.png?height=1080&width=1920&&&&&size=medium)\n\nBy tapping into our *collective* from the outset, we will craft stories that ~~rival~~ exceed those we see today.\n\nBy involving our *collective* from Day 1, we can draw on a broader stream of humankind’s cultural legacy, therefore creating a more equitable creative economy.\n\nBy respecting our *collective*, we will rewire the operating system of the most important industry in the future - `storytelling`.\n\n\n---\n\n## Fuelled by raw NFT IPs, we can redesign the metagame forever\n\nWe face a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rewrite the rules of the creative economy.\n\n### Opportunity: NFTs = Seeds of Future Media Properties\n\n[NFT trading grew 210-fold](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/10/trading-in-nfts-spiked-21000percent-to-top-17-billion-in-2021-report.html) between 2020 and 2021, hitting $17.6 billion. The sudden explosion of interest made ‘*NFT*’ Collins Dictionary's word of the year for 2021.\n\nArt represented by NFTs, or NFT art, is exported to mainstream media via memes (eg.[ Doge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_(meme))) and avatars (eg.[ Bored Ape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bored_Ape)). While the mass propagation of NFT art *sui generis* drives up market demand, capturing such an appreciation in value requires NFT owners to sell their NFTs at a higher price than when they first obtain them. As such, the current *modus operandi* is to promote the future value of one’s NFT until the event of a sale. *Keep shillin’*, as they say.\n\nHowever, a growing number of NFT creators are providing NFT owners with specific rights to IP utilization. As a direct result, NFT owners are now free to develop IP products and monetise a media property based on the NFT art. The most notable example is [Jenkins the Valet](https://www.jenkinsthevalet.com/), slated to be featured in a book.\n\n![NFT art is spawning new stories and worlds. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/W7VcQ4CfVj328mr2AIxMr.png?height=1080&width=1920&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nWhen such an arrangement is in place, NFTs are first-stage proof-of-concept IP products. Given sufficient initial traction, this could lead to the buildout of revenue-generating media properties.\n\n### Problem: Owners ≠ Builders\n\nDue to the lack of skills, experience and coordination, few are able to realise, on their own, the full productive capacity of their NFT art. This is capital that could, in the right hands and on the right terms, be adapted into memorable characters and stories.\n\n**In short, NFT owners are sitting on millions of dollars worth of *underutilised* assets.**\n\n![We're tracking the terms of use for more than 100 NFT projects.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XBxvHC1UGrByBEX2snJcE.png?height=1080&width=1920&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n*What if we could treat NFT art as source material to be transformed into media properties?*\n\nAuthors and playwrights do collaborate with film producers and dedicated creative teams to adapt their works for cinema and TV, and thus receive royalty payments and increased sales revenue of source material.\n\n*Why can’t NFT owners be afforded the same opportunity?*\n\nOur Mecenian economy will be powered by partnerships with NFT projects and blue-chip holders. **This is our window of opportunity to change the paradigm for media creators and consumers, for generations to come.**\n\n![Our current slate of NFT IP projects await the Legislature's review.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AzRwqsr-D7zrqYRiaiu4n.png?height=1080&width=1920&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\n\n---\n\n## Rebels who build change the world\n\nIt’s not enough to critique the old system; we need to build a viable alternative.\n\nAs a team, we have created and scaled organisations, products and services across a multitude of creative industries.\n\n`When it’s time to reveal ourselves, we will.`\n\nHere’s our collective CV:\n\n 1.

{"id": "wRb4zawszBQVjXb__jd3erzLhJcEy4URkNKFQbBPBpA", "title": "一鼓一笛", "body": "       嘉靖三十四年（1555年）和三十五年（1556年）山西地震后在临晋和沁县引发灾民恐慌的朝廷选秀谣言，还有顺治四年（1647年）“讹传朝廷采选秀女”，以至于“府县城镇，乡村僻壤，有女在家者俱惊惶无措”，纷纷把女儿嫁出，非但不要彩礼，连婚宴都免了，“不必三杯水酒，只要一鼓一笛”。记载在《熙朝莆靖小记》中的还有康熙二十七年（1688年）的一场动乱，亦与此有关。当年春天，康熙纳一广东女子为妃，六月初八，漳州和泉州两地突然谣言四起，“或云朝廷要选淑女充掖庭”。\n\n       一时间，地方上人心惶惶，一会儿说“某大人并内监已到福州矣”，一会儿又说差官已经开始到各家点验人口情况了。“有女之家，如负重担，多男之室，居然奇货，已拟配者，催促讨亲，未拟配者，急托媒说合”，漳、泉之地，迎亲送亲的队伍日夜如织，折腾了十天才结束。而到康熙三十一年（1692年），同样的事件在江南再次发生。有谣言说朝廷要选十二三岁的女子入宫，于是有女之家陷入惊恐，未婚女子争相出嫁，“不论贫富，不计礼仪，亦不择门当户对”，彩礼降至“茶二斤，礼银四两”，实在拿不出钱也没关系，只要嫁得出去，就算谢天谢地！\n\n       蒲松龄在《聊斋志异》里也写过一则跟选秀谣言有关的故事，有个叫南三复的，“远于百里外聘曹进士女”。婚礼还没办呢，“民间讹传，朝廷将选良家女充掖庭”，地方上但凡女儿已经定亲的家庭，顾不得礼数，纷纷送孩子去夫家居住。“一日有妪导一舆至，自称曹家送女者”，南三复也不以为奇。老妪扶女入室后，对南三复说：“选嫔之事已急，仓卒不能如礼，且送小娘子来。”南三复惊讶地问怎么没有其他家属跟来，老妪推说薄有奁妆，一会儿就到。\n\n        后来南三复才发现，原来刚刚由老妪送上门的女子根本不是曹家之女，而是姚孝廉刚死的女儿所化之鬼——连女鬼都急着嫁人，可见时人对选秀谣言已经恐惧到了何等地步！事实上，这段读来荒唐的文字，恰恰是蒲松龄对一段亲历的写照，他的妻子刘氏，就是顺治年间“讹传朝廷将选良家子充掖庭，人情汹动”之时，被其父刘公送到蒲家完婚的，当时的刘氏只有13岁。对上述事件，读者或许以为是信息不畅时代的大惊小怪，包括田艺蘅在内的文人，亦感慨“愚民无知谣惑，此甚可笑也”。殊不知百姓有此反应，绝不是自找不痛快，就像有些昆虫遇到触碰立刻拟死一样，是纯粹的防御性措施。", "timestamp": 1653389690, "digest": "xEN85xXppAXZUIbJ6smdBpe9xJvP1JcXMqybA3Msttw", "contributor": "0x9a660094286bF3A8a0B21C6a1E98657a168F7956"}
{"id": "XGZvUHBCKWjho3WQcgUO_Jv4NYgUBYETMA0BmaesjSA", "title": "Thoughts sharing on the emerging \"Asset Management as a Service\" market", "body": "As of May 24th 2022, the last weeks have been a roller-coaster for the crypto & stock market and confirming the entrance into the bear territory: from the “algorithmic stable coin” UST losing its 1:1 peg and LUNA freefalling from $100 to $0.01, to BTC plunging below $30K, or more recently, [the Coinbase Q1FY22 report](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001679788/89c60d81-41a2-4a3c-86fb-b4067ab1016c.pdf) stating that users’ funds could be wiped out under a bankruptcy event scenario. These headlines have been the caviar of the breaking news, Twitter, LinkedIn, and even Instagram. I haven’t heard anyone from my IRL/online network not speaking, or complaining, about this drop in the last weeks.\n\nThe current state of the global economy and the endless crypto news have motivated me to finalize the draft of this article and share my thoughts on the emerging segment within FinTech that I call “ Asset Management as a Service”.\n\n### Definition & Introduction\n\nI discovered this new segment a few months ago while I was mingling between Discord groups to get deals data – jumping in a brief chat with a user, which seems to be financially literate, leads me to the bottomless crypto-asset diversification debate and my first introduction to “Asset Management as a Service”. I could define it as the way to manage and invest clients/LPs’ funds without the need to have ownership and total access and/or control over the financial assets. On the opposite of the traditional approach, where Clients/LPs give up ownership and full control of their funds over a fixed time. It leverages multiple technologies like APIs, AI/ML, and blockchain to disrupt the legacy Asset Management space.\n\nAfter a quick research, the recent data and metrics related to Asset Management blow my mind: this juicy industry [sized $103 trillion in 2021](https://web-assets.bcg.com/79/bf/d1d361854084a9624a0cbce3bf07/bcg-global-asset-management-2021-jul-2021.pdf), and retail portfolios represented 41% of global assets, or $42 trillion according to BCG. The global crypto trend & pandemic have largely contributed to the spike in interest of retail investors for investment products, the US equity trading activity [has doubled since the beginning of the pandemic](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-new-way-to-look-at-retail-trading-trends) based on Nasdaq data, rising from around $18 billion/day (pre-2020) to around $32 billion/day in March 2020. Parallelly, the number of crypto owners expects to grow from [295 million to 1 billion](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hfgyig42jimx/5i8TeN1QYJDjn82pSuZB5S/85c7c9393f3ee67e456ec780f9bf11e3/Cryptodotcom_Crypto_Market_Sizing_Jan2022.pdf) by the end of 2022. The metrics from some companies operating in this space raised my attention to further dive in, like Kryll.io which managed to reach [+$3.5 billion traded volumes in April 2022](https://blog.kryll.io/kryll-changelog-monthly-progress-report-april-2022-metrics/) and operate/use across 112 countries. Or Zignaly, the profit-sharing/copy-trading platform gathers +55K users and manages +$60M AUM through API-linked crypto trading accounts up to date.\n\n### The Market Drivers\n\nAlthough the industry has seen some innovation over the past decade, it still remains fundamentally conservative given the nature of the business. In my opinion, the structural changes and new technology applied to finance will be key drivers of the emergence of the “Asset Management as a Service” market:\n\n* First and foremost, the global population is getting more educated about the Financial Market and the basics of Personal Finance. The multiplication of trading apps, like Binance or RobinHood, and neo-banking offering stock or crypto investing product illustrates the willingness of this new generation to keep full control and ownership over their financial assets. According to [The Motley Fool survey 2021](https://www.fool.com/research/what-are-gen-z-millennial-investors-buying/), 73% of Gen Z investors, and 66% of millennial investors own stocks, and unsurprisingly, 40% of stock investors aged 18 to 40 own cryptocurrencies, which demonstrates a genuine interest in the financial industry. Charles Swab talks now about the [“Generation I(nvestor)”.](https://www.aboutschwab.com/generation-investor-study-2021)\n* The decentralization of Investment Management knowledge outside of the banking/hedge fund industry and the growing individual/independent investor community across social networks has largely participated in the change of the Asset Management landscape. The episode of [Reddit’s traders vs HFs](https://www.ft.com/content/7a91e3ea-b9ec-4611-9a03-a8dd3b8bddb5), or the [anonymous Twitter user explaining step by step how to break Terra](https://twitter.com/FreddieRaynolds/status/1463960623402913797) in Nov. 2022,  illustrates the capacity of some retail investors to research/act like a \"professional\" investor. The community aspect and knowledge sharing play a crucial role in the Future of Asset Management: favoriting the \"multiplayer\" and \"community-belonging\" sentiment that leads to higher engagement. Additionally, the multiple FinMeme/StockMeme accounts on Instagram & Twitter gathering several millions of followers genuinely outline the exponential factor of Community in the global financial industry.

The consumerization of the financial market and the democratization of retail investing activities play a subsequent stake in the emergence of the “Asset Management as a Service” space, as well as, participating in the popularization of new investment instruments, like NFT or cryptocurrencies. Technical innovations applied to Financial Services – like API, Blockchain, Bots, or AI/ML – are the main drivers of this new market. Quantitative/algorithmic investment strategies are getting more traction within the stock market in the past years (e.g. Two Sigma, Renaissance Technologies…), and automation has become a norm in the Finance industry. APIs can allow anyone to manage your brokerage/trading account with specific restrictions, Blockchain – especially smart contracts – acts as a safeguard/trusted-third party, and bots automize investment strategies while minimizing cognitive biases. Venture investments have started to hit the space, and startups have begun to stand out, such as the US-company Alpaca building a developer-first API for stock/crypto trading that secured [+$70M from VC firms](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/alpaca-raises-50m-to-rapidly-scale-its-equities-trading-api-business/), or Zignaly developing a profit-sharing based copy-trading platform for digital assets raised +$50M.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads me to think of a future where people would easily access  \"Plug'n'Play\" alpha-generating services within a few clicks, and anyone would be able to start \"independent\" Asset Management activities with enterprise-grade tools/ infrastructures.\n\n### Applications\n\nFrom my investigation, the “Asset Management as a Service” landscape is growing over the days and attracting more retail and institutional investors. Applications within this space include: marketplaces matching Asset Managers & customers, create/rent/sell/buy investment strategies, NFT-based Asset Management, DAO, wallet-2-wallet following, API-based trading infrastructure, and enterprise-grade tools for retail investors/independent Asset Managers.

{"id": "sIfE-fmf44Fao2bZJYBN-_N94UFOoqy8COGoErbgOQQ", "title": "Thoughts sharing on the emerging \"Asset Management as a Service\" market", "body": "As of May 24th 2022, the last weeks have been a roller-coaster for the crypto & stock market and confirming the entrance into the bear territory: from the “algorithmic stable coin” UST losing its 1:1 peg and LUNA freefalling from $100 to $0.01, to BTC plunging below $30K, or more recently, [the Coinbase Q1FY22 report](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001679788/89c60d81-41a2-4a3c-86fb-b4067ab1016c.pdf) stating that users’ funds could be wiped out under a bankruptcy event scenario. These headlines have been the caviar of the breaking news, Twitter, LinkedIn, and even Instagram. I haven’t heard anyone from my IRL/online network not speaking, or complaining, about this drop in the last weeks.\n\nThe current state of the global economy and the endless crypto news have motivated me to finalize the draft of this article and share my thoughts on the emerging segment within FinTech that I call “ Asset Management as a Service”.\n\n### Definition & Introduction\n\nI discovered this new segment a few months ago while I was mingling between Discord groups to get deals data – jumping in a brief chat with a user, who seems to be financially literate, leads me to the bottomless crypto-asset diversification debate and my first introduction to “Asset Management as a Service”. I could define it as the way to manage and invest clients/LPs’ funds without the need to have ownership and total access and/or control over the financial assets. On the opposite of the traditional approach, where Clients/LPs give up ownership and full control of their funds over a fixed time. It leverages multiple technologies like APIs, AI/ML, and blockchain to disrupt the legacy Asset Management space.\n\nAfter a quick research, the recent data and metrics related to Asset Management blow my mind: this juicy industry [sized $103 trillion in 2021](https://web-assets.bcg.com/79/bf/d1d361854084a9624a0cbce3bf07/bcg-global-asset-management-2021-jul-2021.pdf), and retail portfolios represented 41% of global assets, or $42 trillion according to BCG. The global crypto trend & pandemic have largely contributed to the spike in interest of retail investors for investment products, the US equity trading activity [has doubled since the beginning of the pandemic](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-new-way-to-look-at-retail-trading-trends) based on Nasdaq data, rising from around $18 billion/day (pre-2020) to around $32 billion/day in March 2020. Parallelly, the number of crypto owners is expected to grow from [295 million to 1 billion](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hfgyig42jimx/5i8TeN1QYJDjn82pSuZB5S/85c7c9393f3ee67e456ec780f9bf11e3/Cryptodotcom_Crypto_Market_Sizing_Jan2022.pdf) by the end of 2022. The metrics from some companies operating in this space raised my attention to further dive in, like Kryll.io which managed to reach [+$3.5 billion traded volumes in April 2022](https://blog.kryll.io/kryll-changelog-monthly-progress-report-april-2022-metrics/) and operate/use across 112 countries. Or Zignaly, the profit-sharing/copy-trading platform gathers +55K users and manages +$60M AUM through API-linked crypto trading accounts up to date.\n\n### The Market Drivers\n\nAlthough the industry has seen some innovation over the past decade, it still remains fundamentally conservative given the nature of the business. In my opinion, the structural changes and new technology applied to finance will be key drivers of the emergence of the “Asset Management as a Service” market:\n\n* First and foremost, the global population is getting more educated about the Financial Market and the basics of Personal Finance. The multiplication of trading apps, like Binance or RobinHood, and neo-banking offering stock or crypto investing product illustrates the willingness of this new generation to keep full control and ownership over their financial assets. According to [The Motley Fool survey 2021](https://www.fool.com/research/what-are-gen-z-millennial-investors-buying/), 73% of Gen Z investors, and 66% of millennial investors own stocks, and unsurprisingly, 40% of stock investors aged 18 to 40 own cryptocurrencies, which demonstrates a genuine interest in the financial industry. Charles Swab talks now about the [“Generation I(nvestor)”.](https://www.aboutschwab.com/generation-investor-study-2021)\n* The decentralization of Investment Management knowledge outside of the banking/hedge fund industry and the growing individual/independent investor community across social networks has largely participated in the change of the Asset Management landscape. The episode of [Reddit’s traders vs HFs](https://www.ft.com/content/7a91e3ea-b9ec-4611-9a03-a8dd3b8bddb5), or the [anonymous Twitter user explaining step by step how to break Terra](https://twitter.com/FreddieRaynolds/status/1463960623402913797) in Nov. 2022,  illustrates the capacity of some retail investors to research/act like a \"professional\" investor. The community aspect and knowledge sharing play a crucial role in the Future of Asset Management: favoriting the \"multiplayer\" and \"community-belonging\" sentiment that leads to higher engagement. Additionally, the multiple FinMeme/StockMeme accounts on Instagram & Twitter gathering several millions of followers genuinely outline the exponential factor of Community in the global financial industry. A16Z addresses better the community-first social investing topic in the \"[Big ideas that fintech will tackle in 2022](https://a16z.com/2021/12/20/the-big-ideas-that-fintech-will-tackle-in-2022/#:\\~:text=In%202022%2C%20we'll%20see,fiat%20and%20crypto%20financial%20lives)” post.\n* Aforementioned above, trading platforms blossoming over the past years have upside down the traditional investing/trading market by granting commission-free, low-capital access, and fractional shares trading. The consumerization of the financial market and the democratization of retail investing activities play a subsequent stake in the emergence of the “Asset Management as a Service” space, as well as, participating in the popularization of new investment instruments, like NFT or cryptocurrencies. Technical innovations applied to Financial Services – like API, Blockchain, Bots, or AI/ML – are the main drivers of this new market. Quantitative/algorithmic investment strategies are getting more traction within the stock market in the past years (e.g. Two Sigma, Renaissance Technologies…), and automation has become a norm in the Finance industry. APIs can allow anyone to manage your brokerage/trading account with specific restrictions, Blockchain – especially smart contracts – acts as a safeguard/trusted-third party, and bots automize investment strategies while minimizing cognitive biases. Venture investments have started to hit the space, and startups have begun to stand out, such as the US-company Alpaca building a developer-first API for stock/crypto trading that secured [+$70M from VC firms](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/alpaca-raises-50m-to-rapidly-scale-its-equities-trading-api-business/), or Zignaly developing a profit-sharing based copy-trading platform for digital assets raised +$50M.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads me to think of a future where people would easily access  \"Plug'n'Play\" alpha-generating services within a few clicks, and anyone would be able to start \"independent\" Asset Management activities with enterprise-grade tools/ infrastructures.\n\n### Applications\n\nFrom my investigation, the “Asset Management as a Service” landscape is growing over the days and attracting more retail and institutional investors.

{"id": "BcJVSVQvwa76cwTI8hMWADNAPw-r1QIMtSG2yd04iT4", "title": "O que são NFTs?", "body": "## Definição\n\nA tecnologia dos NFTs, **Non-Fungible Tokens**, foi creada em 2017 através de contratos inteligentes na blockchain Ethereum. No início de 2021, os NFTs entram de repente em destaque no mundo das criptomoedas e tecnologia subjacente (blockchain).\n\nUm NFT é um tipo de token. **Mas o que são tokens?**\n\n**Tokens** são unidades virtuais que confirmam a posse de certo activo digital. Os tokens operam com base na tecnologia blockchain, aquela que está na base das criptomoedas. Para entender melhor os conceitos **blockchain** e **criptomoeda**, recomendo a leitura deste artigo:\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x2DBF911D78815D995B05bc8FA42e378f78D7CC7b/0vQjECsvCIYUAkSbXuKWo3Jncbsg3ZiaaS0-2fraLnQ](https://mirror.xyz/0x2DBF911D78815D995B05bc8FA42e378f78D7CC7b/0vQjECsvCIYUAkSbXuKWo3Jncbsg3ZiaaS0-2fraLnQ)\n\nEntre todos os tokens existentes (mais de 13 000 neste momento - o site [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) chama-os todos de ‘Coins’, mas na realidade só alguns são moedas) há alguns que se chamam moedas. Uma moeda, ou criptomoeda, é semelhante a uma moeda física, e é um token nativo de certa blockchain. Cada blockchain só tem uma moeda, mas pode ter vários tokens. As moedas tipicamente têm o mesmo nome da blockchain onde operam. Por exemplo, [SOLANA](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana) (SOL) é a moeda da blockchain Solana, e [SOLCIAL](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solcial) (SLCL) é um token que opera nessa mesma blockchain. Por exemplo, [ETHEREUM ou ETHER](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum) (ETH) é a moeda da blockchain Ethereum, e [BASIC ATTENTION TOKEN](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/basic-attention-token) (BAT) é um token que opera nessa mesma blockchain. Note-se que tokens que não sejam nativos, i.e não sejam moedas, podem existir em várias blockchains, como é o caso do BAT (tal facto está indicado no campo ‘Contract’, menu **…**, em **Info** - ver link acima).\n\nOs portadores de tokens podem, além de os guardar nas suas carteiras digitais, trocá-los por outros tokens em casas de cambio online, vendê-los (NFTs) em *marketplaces*, oferecê-los, ou usá-los para comprar algo. Existem vários tipos de tokens, entre os quais destaco:\n\n* **Pagamento** – usado para efectuar transações financeiras no mundo digital (moedas como Solana, Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum).\n* **Utilitário** – usado para dar acesso a produtos ou serviços baseados em alguma blockchain.\n\n  Todos os tipos anteriores são **fungíveis** (*fungible tokens*), ou seja, podem ser trocados por algo de valor igual – 1 Bitcoin na mão da pessoa A vale o mesmo que 1 Bitcoin na mão da pessoa B, ou seja, se as pessoas trocarem as moedas o cenário não se altera. Tal não se passa com os NFTs, pois cada um é único. Diz-se por isso que são **não-fungíveis**.\n* **NFT** – certificados digitais únicos de trabalhos originais, onde o criador original terá sempre controlo sobre a forma como o trabalho é licensiado. São compostos por vários elementos, tais como:\n  * **conteúdo digital** que representa – ficheiro de imagem, audio, texto, ou vídeo.\n  * **criador** – identificação do criador do token.\n  * **proprietário** – identificação do actual proprietário do token, o qual será ainda o criador se o token não tiver sido oferecido ou vendido.\n  * **preço ou ofertas**, caso esteja à venda ou em leilão.\n  * **metadados** – informações sobre o activo digital, como assinatura do criador, descrição, tipo de ficheiro, resolução, histórico de transações, data e hora da sua criação, …\n\nOutra diferença entre **NFTs** e tokens fungíveis (como moedas, por exemplo) é a **indivisibilidade** dos primeiros. Por exemplo, poderás enviar 0.05 Bitcoins a um amigo, mas não poderás fazer o mesmo com 5% de um NFT.\n\n## Valor\n\nSe todos os criadores digitais publicarem os seus novos trabalhos, originais, como NFT, todo aquele que tentar copiar o seu trabalho e certificá-lo como NFT, muito dificilmente terá o seu trabalho reconhecido como original. Isto porque existem mecanismos (e cada vez existirão mais) para saber se certo conteúdo digital já foi publicado mais que uma vez na web como NFT (e.g, vários marketplaces fazem essa fiscalização, em breve existirão **motores de busca de NFTs** – ver websites em baixo, e poderás usar o [motor de busca da Google](https://images.google.com/) para saber a localização de certo ficheiro de imagem).\n\n[https://nftsearch.site/](https://nftsearch.site/)\n\n**Nota**: *se ainda não existir na base de dados, deverás/poderás adicionar o NFT que procuras à mesma*.\n\n[https://hebys.io/](https://hebys.io/)\n\n[https://nftlab.com/](https://nftlab.com/)\n\n[https://nooft.io/](https://nooft.io/)\n\nRegra geral, é possível salvar ou copiar o conteúdo digital de um NFT, seja uma imagem, vídeo, áudio ou documento, mas nunca será possível copiar o NFT. Esse terá sempre um único proprietário. Uma pessoa que crie um NFT com base na cópia  (ficheiro, screenshot) do conteúdo digital de outro NFT, terá sempre em sua posse um NFT distinto, publicado em data posterior à do original.\n\n> *Markets for traditional art and collectibles are thriving despite forgeries, and the issue is even smaller with NFTs* ([ref](https://archive.ph/ptRTw))\n\nOs NFTs podem ser programados para permitir ao criador/autor arrecadar dinheiro sempre que o NFT for vendido, normalmente entre 2.5% a 10% do preço de venda.\n\n## Como Criar e Comercializar?\n\nQualquer pessoa pode criar algo digitalmente, transformá-lo num NFT em alguma blockchain (processo chamado ‘Minting’ em Inglês), e colocar esse token para venda em algum *marketplace* online. Alguns locais cobram para publiar os teus NFTs. Qualquer marketplace cobra uma taxa do valor de venda de cada NFT, a qual poderá ser suportada pelo comprador ou pelo vendedor, dependendo da plataforma.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GGvxJ9xOJMs4wmx6mBN0S.png?height=530&width=1127)\n\nDe modo a poderes comprar um NFT, precisarás de dispor na tua carteira digital da criptomoeda associada à blockchain onde o token está alojado.\n\n### Marketplaces\n\n[https://support.exodus.com/article/1663-nft-gallery#nft-gallery](https://support.exodus.com/article/1663-nft-gallery#nft-gallery)\n\n[https://www.magiceden.io/](https://www.magiceden.io/)\n\n[https://rarible.com/](https://rarible.com/)\n\n[https://www.mintbase.io/](https://www.mintbase.io/)\n\n[https://www.higgsfield.io/](https://www.higgsfield.io/)\n\n[https://apollo42.app/](https://apollo42.app/)\n\n[https://galacticway.io/](https://galacticway.io/)\n\n[https://www.gem.xyz/](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n[https://www.genesishouse.io/](https://www.genesishouse.io/)\n\n[https://makersplace.com/](https://makersplace.com/)\n\n[https://digitaleyes.market/](https://digitaleyes.market/)\n\n[https://zora.co/](https://zora.co/)\n\n[https://kalamint.io/](https://kalamint.io/)\n\n[https://solsea.io/](https://solsea.io/)\n\n[https://mintable.app/](https://mintable.app/)\n\n## Referências\n\n[https://archive.ph/NlxxB](https://archive.ph/NlxxB)\n\n[https://archive.ph/oKR8W](https://archive.ph/oKR8W)\n\n[https://archive.ph/AWjJO](https://archive.ph/AWjJO)\n\n[https://archive.ph/vKltQ](https://archive.ph/vKltQ)\n\n[https://archive.ph/BYYKv](https://archive.ph/BYYKv)\n\n[https://archive.ph/xvBDn](https://archive.ph/xvBDn)\n\n[https://archive.ph/C4Sbu](https://archive.ph/C4Sbu)\n\n[https://archive.ph/1hOCp](https://archive.ph/1hOCp)\n\n[https://archive.ph/Z4UkZ](https://archive.ph/Z4UkZ)\n\n[https://archive.ph/pIeKl](https://archive.ph/pIeKl)\n\n[https://archive.ph/O7zOR](https://archive.ph/O7zOR)\n\n[https://archive.ph/3gqjg](https://archive.ph/3gqjg)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653390328, "digest": "ZlWGomlkZpIdsKHll84TGQDgKfC_SWuB_UaVYFDYoQU", "contributor": "0x2DBF911D78815D995B05bc8FA42e378f78D7CC7b"}

I could define it as the way to manage and invest clients/LPs’ funds without the need to have ownership and total access and/or control over the financial assets. On the opposite of the traditional approach, where Clients/LPs give up ownership and full control of their funds over a fixed time. It leverages multiple technologies like APIs, AI/ML, and blockchain to disrupt the legacy Asset Management space.\n\nAfter a quick research, the recent data and metrics related to Asset Management blow my mind: this juicy industry [sized $103 trillion in 2021](https://web-assets.bcg.com/79/bf/d1d361854084a9624a0cbce3bf07/bcg-global-asset-management-2021-jul-2021.pdf), and retail portfolios represented 41% of global assets, or $42 trillion according to BCG. The global crypto trend & pandemic have largely contributed to the spike in interest of retail investors for investment products, the US equity trading activity [has doubled since the beginning of the pandemic](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-new-way-to-look-at-retail-trading-trends) based on Nasdaq data, rising from around $18 billion/day (pre-2020) to around $32 billion/day in March 2020. Parallelly, the number of crypto owners is expected to grow from [295 million to 1 billion](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hfgyig42jimx/5i8TeN1QYJDjn82pSuZB5S/85c7c9393f3ee67e456ec780f9bf11e3/Cryptodotcom_Crypto_Market_Sizing_Jan2022.pdf) by the end of 2022. The metrics from some companies operating in this space raised my attention to further dive in, like Kryll.io which managed to reach [+$3.5 billion traded volumes in April 2022](https://blog.kryll.io/kryll-changelog-monthly-progress-report-april-2022-metrics/) and operate/use across 112 countries.

It leverages multiple technologies like APIs, AI/ML, and blockchain to disrupt the legacy Asset Management space.\n\nAfter a quick research, the recent data and metrics related to Asset Management blow my mind: this juicy industry [sized $103 trillion in 2021](https://web-assets.bcg.com/79/bf/d1d361854084a9624a0cbce3bf07/bcg-global-asset-management-2021-jul-2021.pdf), and retail portfolios represented 41% of global assets, or $42 trillion according to BCG. The global crypto trend & pandemic have largely contributed to the spike in interest of retail investors for investment products, the US equity trading activity [has doubled since the beginning of the pandemic](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-new-way-to-look-at-retail-trading-trends) based on Nasdaq data, rising from around $18 billion/day (pre-2020) to around $32 billion/day in March 2020. Parallelly, the number of crypto owners is expected to grow from [295 million to 1 billion](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hfgyig42jimx/5i8TeN1QYJDjn82pSuZB5S/85c7c9393f3ee67e456ec780f9bf11e3/Cryptodotcom_Crypto_Market_Sizing_Jan2022.pdf) by the end of 2022. The metrics from some companies operating in this space raised my attention to further dive in, like Kryll.io which managed to reach [+$3.5 billion traded volumes in April 2022](https://blog.kryll.io/kryll-changelog-monthly-progress-report-april-2022-metrics/) and operate/use across 112 countries. Or Zignaly, the profit-sharing/copy-trading platform gathers +55K users and manages +$60M AUM through API-linked crypto trading accounts up to date.\n\n### The Market Drivers\n\nAlthough the industry has seen some innovation over the past decade, it still remains fundamentally conservative given the nature of the business. In my opinion, the structural changes and new technologies applied to finance will be key drivers of the emergence of the “Asset Management as a Service” market:\n\n* First and foremost, the global population is getting more educated about the Financial Market and the basics of Personal Finance. The multiplication of trading apps, like Binance or RobinHood, and neo-banking offering stock or crypto investing product illustrates the willingness of this new generation to keep full control and ownership over their financial assets. According to [The Motley Fool survey 2021](https://www.fool.com/research/what-are-gen-z-millennial-investors-buying/), 73% of Gen Z investors, and 66% of millennial investors own stocks, and unsurprisingly, 40% of stock investors aged 18 to 40 own cryptocurrencies, which demonstrates a genuine interest in the financial industry. Charles Swab talks now about the [“Generation I(nvestor)”.](https://www.aboutschwab.com/generation-investor-study-2021)\n* The decentralization of Investment Management knowledge outside of the banking/hedge fund industry and the growing individual/independent investor community across social networks has largely participated in the change of the Asset Management landscape. The episode of [Reddit’s traders vs HFs](https://www.ft.com/content/7a91e3ea-b9ec-4611-9a03-a8dd3b8bddb5), or the [anonymous Twitter user explaining step by step how to break Terra](https://twitter.com/FreddieRaynolds/status/1463960623402913797) in Nov. 2021,  illustrates the capacity of some retail investors to research/act like \"professional\" investors. The community aspect and knowledge sharing play a crucial role in the Future of Asset Management: favoriting the \"multiplayer\" and \"community-belonging\" sentiment that leads to higher engagement. Additionally, the multiple FinMeme/StockMeme accounts on Instagram & Twitter gathering several millions of followers genuinely outline the exponential factor of Community in the global financial industry. A16Z addresses better the community-first social investing topic in the \"[Big ideas that fintech will tackle in 2022](https://a16z.com/2021/12/20/the-big-ideas-that-fintech-will-tackle-in-2022/#:\\~:text=In%202022%2C%20we'll%20see,fiat%20and%20crypto%20financial%20lives)” post.\n* Aforementioned above, trading platforms blossoming over the past years have upside down the traditional investing/trading market by granting commission-free, low-capital access, and fractional shares trading. The consumerization of the financial market and the democratization of retail investing activities play a subsequent stake in the emergence of the “Asset Management as a Service” space, as well as, participating in the popularization of new investment instruments, like NFTs or cryptocurrencies. Technical innovations applied to Financial Services – like APIs, Blockchain, Bots, or AI/ML – are the main drivers of this new market. Quantitative/algorithmic investment strategies are getting more traction within the stock market in the past years (e.g. Two Sigma, Renaissance Technologies…), and automation has become a norm in the Finance industry. APIs can allow anyone to manage your brokerage/trading account with specific restrictions, Blockchain – especially smart contracts – acts as a safeguard/trusted-third party, and bots automize investment strategies while minimizing cognitive biases. Venture investments have started to hit the space, and startups have begun to stand out, such as the US-company Alpaca building a developer-first API for stock/crypto trading that secured [+$70M from VC firms](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/alpaca-raises-50m-to-rapidly-scale-its-equities-trading-api-business/), or Zignaly developing a profit-sharing based copy-trading platform for digital assets raised +$50M.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads me to think of a future where people would easily access  \"plug and play\" alpha-generating services within a few clicks, and anyone would be able to start \"independent\" Asset Management activities with enterprise-grade tools/ infrastructures.\n\n### Applications\n\nFrom my investigation, the “Asset Management as a Service” landscape is growing over the days and attracting more retail and institutional investors. Applications within this space include: marketplaces matching Asset Managers & customers, investment strategy creation/rental/sell/purchase platform, NFT-based asset management, DAO, wallet-2-wallet following, API-based trading infrastructure/web3 infrastructure, and enterprise-grade tools for retail investors/independent Asset Managers. Find below some interesting companies that I have spotted operating in this space.\n\n![Segment mapping](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sw5IVoRmZPCOy1NsK6oZV.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this blog post! if you have any questions and comments, or just want to chat, please feel free to [reach out to me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-chen-t-h-3b40ba122/).

{"id": "hfw04NdvtXjFLzML61J91R890MyRvjHPCkbWUnSYg80", "title": "O que são NFTs?", "body": "## Definição\n\nA tecnologia dos NFTs, **Non-Fungible Tokens**, foi creada em 2017 através de contratos inteligentes na blockchain Ethereum. No início de 2021, os NFTs entram de repente em destaque no mundo das criptomoedas e tecnologia subjacente (blockchain).\n\nUm NFT é um tipo de token. **Mas o que são tokens?**\n\n**Tokens** são unidades virtuais que confirmam a posse de certo activo digital. Os tokens operam com base na tecnologia blockchain, aquela que está na base das criptomoedas. Para entender melhor os conceitos **blockchain** e **criptomoeda**, recomendo a leitura deste artigo:\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x2DBF911D78815D995B05bc8FA42e378f78D7CC7b/0vQjECsvCIYUAkSbXuKWo3Jncbsg3ZiaaS0-2fraLnQ](https://mirror.xyz/0x2DBF911D78815D995B05bc8FA42e378f78D7CC7b/0vQjECsvCIYUAkSbXuKWo3Jncbsg3ZiaaS0-2fraLnQ)\n\nEntre todos os tokens existentes (mais de 13 000 neste momento - o site [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) chama-os todos de ‘Coins’, mas na realidade só alguns são moedas) há alguns que se chamam moedas. Uma moeda, ou criptomoeda, é semelhante a uma moeda física, e é um token nativo de certa blockchain. Cada blockchain só tem uma moeda, mas pode ter vários tokens. As moedas tipicamente têm o mesmo nome da blockchain onde operam. Por exemplo, [SOLANA](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana) (SOL) é a moeda da blockchain Solana, e [SOLCIAL](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solcial) (SLCL) é um token que opera nessa mesma blockchain. Por exemplo, [ETHEREUM ou ETHER](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum) (ETH) é a moeda da blockchain Ethereum, e [BASIC ATTENTION TOKEN](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/basic-attention-token) (BAT) é um token que opera nessa mesma blockchain. Note-se que tokens que não sejam nativos, i.e não sejam moedas, podem existir em várias blockchains, como é o caso do BAT (tal facto está indicado no campo ‘Contract’, menu **…**, em **Info** - ver link acima).\n\nOs portadores de tokens podem, além de os guardar nas suas carteiras digitais, trocá-los por outros tokens em casas de cambio online, vendê-los (NFTs) em *marketplaces*, oferecê-los, ou usá-los para comprar algo. Existem vários tipos de tokens, entre os quais destaco:\n\n* **Pagamento** – usado para efectuar transações financeiras no mundo digital (moedas como Solana, Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum).\n* **Utilitário** – usado para dar acesso a produtos ou serviços baseados em alguma blockchain.\n\n  Todos os tipos anteriores são **fungíveis** (*fungible tokens*), ou seja, podem ser trocados por algo de valor igual – 1 Bitcoin na mão da pessoa A vale o mesmo que 1 Bitcoin na mão da pessoa B, ou seja, se as pessoas trocarem as moedas o cenário não se altera. Tal não se passa com os NFTs, pois cada um é único. Diz-se por isso que são **não-fungíveis**.\n* **NFT** – certificados digitais únicos de trabalhos originais, onde o criador original terá sempre controlo sobre a forma como o trabalho é licensiado. São compostos por vários elementos, tais como:\n  * **conteúdo digital** que representa – ficheiro de imagem, audio, texto, ou vídeo.\n  * **criador** – identificação do criador do token.\n  * **proprietário** – identificação do actual proprietário do token, o qual será ainda o criador se o token não tiver sido oferecido ou vendido.\n  * **preço ou ofertas**, caso esteja à venda ou em leilão.\n  * **metadados** – informações sobre o activo digital, como assinatura do criador, descrição, tipo de ficheiro, resolução, histórico de transações, data e hora da sua criação, …\n\nOutra diferença entre **NFTs** e tokens fungíveis (como moedas, por exemplo) é a **indivisibilidade** dos primeiros. Por exemplo, poderás enviar 0.05 Bitcoins a um amigo, mas não poderás fazer o mesmo com 5% de um NFT.\n\n## Valor\n\nSe todos os criadores digitais publicarem os seus novos trabalhos, originais, como NFT, todo aquele que tentar copiar o seu trabalho e certificá-lo como NFT, muito dificilmente terá o seu trabalho reconhecido como original. Isto porque existem mecanismos (e cada vez existirão mais) para saber se certo conteúdo digital já foi publicado mais que uma vez na web como NFT (e.g, vários marketplaces fazem essa fiscalização, em breve existirão **motores de busca de NFTs** – ver websites em baixo, e poderás usar o [motor de busca da Google](https://images.google.com/) para saber a localização de certo ficheiro de imagem).\n\n[https://nftsearch.site/](https://nftsearch.site/)\n\n**Nota**: *se ainda não existir na base de dados, deverás/poderás adicionar o NFT que procuras à mesma*.\n\n[https://hebys.io/](https://hebys.io/)\n\n[https://nftlab.com/](https://nftlab.com/)\n\n[https://nooft.io/](https://nooft.io/)\n\nRegra geral, é possível salvar ou copiar o conteúdo digital de um NFT, seja uma imagem, vídeo, áudio ou documento, mas nunca será possível copiar o NFT. Esse terá sempre um único proprietário. Uma pessoa que crie um NFT com base na cópia  (ficheiro, screenshot) do conteúdo digital de outro NFT, terá sempre em sua posse um NFT distinto, publicado em data posterior à do original.\n\n> *Markets for traditional art and collectibles are thriving despite forgeries, and the issue is even smaller with NFTs* ([ref](https://archive.ph/ptRTw))\n\nOs NFTs podem ser programados para permitir ao criador/autor arrecadar dinheiro sempre que o NFT for vendido, normalmente entre 2.5% a 10% do preço de venda.\n\n## Como Criar e Comercializar?\n\nQualquer pessoa pode criar algo digitalmente, transformá-lo num NFT em alguma blockchain (processo chamado ‘Minting’ em Inglês), e colocar esse token para venda em algum *marketplace* online. Alguns locais cobram para publiar os teus NFTs. Qualquer marketplace cobra uma taxa do valor de venda de cada NFT, a qual poderá ser suportada pelo comprador ou pelo vendedor, dependendo da plataforma.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GGvxJ9xOJMs4wmx6mBN0S.png?height=530&width=1127)\n\nDe modo a poderes comprar um NFT, precisarás de dispor na tua carteira digital da criptomoeda associada à blockchain onde o token está alojado.\n\n### Marketplaces\n\n[https://www.magiceden.io/](https://www.magiceden.io/)\n\n[https://rarible.com/](https://rarible.com/)\n\n[https://www.mintbase.io/](https://www.mintbase.io/)\n\n[https://www.higgsfield.io/](https://www.higgsfield.io/)\n\n[https://apollo42.app/](https://apollo42.app/)\n\n[https://galacticway.io/](https://galacticway.io/)\n\n[https://www.gem.xyz/](https://www.gem.xyz/)\n\n[https://www.genesishouse.io/](https://www.genesishouse.io/)\n\n[https://makersplace.com/](https://makersplace.com/)\n\n[https://digitaleyes.market/](https://digitaleyes.market/)\n\n[https://zora.co/](https://zora.co/)\n\n[https://kalamint.io/](https://kalamint.io/)\n\n[https://solsea.io/](https://solsea.io/)\n\n[https://mintable.app/](https://mintable.app/)\n\n## Referências\n\n[https://archive.ph/NlxxB](https://archive.ph/NlxxB)\n\n[https://archive.ph/oKR8W](https://archive.ph/oKR8W)\n\n[https://archive.ph/AWjJO](https://archive.ph/AWjJO)\n\n[https://archive.ph/vKltQ](https://archive.ph/vKltQ)\n\n[https://archive.ph/BYYKv](https://archive.ph/BYYKv)\n\n[https://archive.ph/xvBDn](https://archive.ph/xvBDn)\n\n[https://archive.ph/C4Sbu](https://archive.ph/C4Sbu)\n\n[https://archive.ph/1hOCp](https://archive.ph/1hOCp)\n\n[https://archive.ph/Z4UkZ](https://archive.ph/Z4UkZ)\n\n[https://archive.ph/pIeKl](https://archive.ph/pIeKl)\n\n[https://archive.ph/O7zOR](https://archive.ph/O7zOR)\n\n[https://archive.ph/3gqjg](https://archive.ph/3gqjg)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653390573, "digest": "ZlWGomlkZpIdsKHll84TGQDgKfC_SWuB_UaVYFDYoQU", "contributor": "0x2DBF911D78815D995B05bc8FA42e378f78D7CC7b"}

Abbiamo intrattenuto [call mensili](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG2MeKuKDJRK4gFNk-dQuZQ), tenuto [conferenze](https://www.scalingethereum.org/), e [creato nuovi design che gli implementatori potevano adottare](https://medium.com/the-polygon-blog/plasma-predicates-one-step-towards-generalized-plasma-7349758df251#:\\~:text=Plasma%20Group%20had,work%20they%20do.).\n\nMa a plasma [mancava qualcosa](https://youtu.be/KZmLmt9f_uk?t=381), e abbiamo cominciato a cercare qualcosa di nuovo.\n\nQualcosa di migliore.\n\n**PIU’ OTTIMISMO**\n\nNel giugno del 2019, abbiamo capito che il design di rollup di Vitalik [poteva essere applicato](https://plasma.build/t/rollup-plasma-for-mass-exits-complex-disputes/90) ai pattern ottimistici di plasma. Con l’aiuto della community, i design furono evoluti velocemente, e nacque l’[Optimistic Rollup](https://medium.com/plasma-group/ethereum-smart-contracts-in-l2-optimistic-rollup-2c1cef2ec537).\n\nGli Optimistic Rollup promettevano di eseguire qualsiasi contratto Ethereum, ma 5-500x meno costoso. Era la risposta alle necessità di scalabilità di Ethereum.\n\nE l’avremmo costruito noi. Ci serviva un team.\n\nE così, [abbiamo raccolto i nostri primi $3.5M](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/02/11/plasma-became-optimism-and-it-might-just-save-ethereum/) da Paradigm poco dopo aver rilasciato Unipig - la prima rollup PoC, una collaborazione con Uniswap - a Devcon V.\n\nAlla fine, sono serviti anni affinchè [l’endgame della scalabilità](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html) si mostrasse completamente. Ma, fino ad oggi, sono i design a sedere al centro della roadmap [rollup-centrica](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) e pragmatica di Ethereum.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bfc1wMv26G5_U9qvkCH_9.png?height=359&width=717)\n\nL’anno successivo è stato pieno di lezioni senza prezzo mentre abbiamo creato il network e il team. Abbiamo lanciato due testnet incentivate con Synthetix, saltando dalla ricerca allo sviluppo di un production network.\n\nProbabilmente la lezione più importante che abbiamo avuto riguarda la crescita della squadra. Ad un certo punto, un nostro membro, Mark, ha fatto campeggio sul tetto del nostro appartamento a New York per garantire che la testnet continuasse a funzionare senza problemi. E sì, ha letteralmente fatto campeggio.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cZNC1WyNjMdRmTfBgUlj1.png?height=344&width=715)\n\nPer rendere scalabile Ethereum, dovevamo scalare noi stessi. E così abbiamo scalato il nostro team.\n\nOggi siamo 40 con [un gruppo eccezionale di autori EIP, maghi del prodotto, e stregoni dei protocolli.](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC/status/1499798893831155716?s=20&t=mDi6QeMubfxxZ3_Me1MS7g) Siamo eternamente grati a persone come Mark e alla comunità SNX che sono rimasti con noi dai giorni in cui eravamo un piccolo, sgangherato gruppo di persone fino a diventare una forza di tutto rispetto <3.\n\nSaremmo in difetto se non ringraziassimo anche il leggendario [geohot](https://github.com/geohot) per la sua guida. Le sue lezioni sono servite da guida per le nostre best practices e come metro per l’eccellenza negli anni a venire.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E4aIkQTxPjaT1uroGFxg8.png?height=665&width=504)\n\n**SISTEMARE LO STACK**\n\nAbbiamo imparato molto riguardo a come la scalabilità si relaziona all’esperienza dei developer - ad esempio, facendoci da parte e lasciando che Ethereum facesse le sue cose.\n\nQueste lezioni sono culminate con la più grande update di Optimism di sempre: [EVM Equivalence.](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/the-future-of-optimistic-ethereum-7f22d987331) Questo upgrade ha ridotto drasticamente l’impatto di Optimism e allo stesso tempo ha abilitato il deployment in un click e gli strumenti per lavorarci da subito.\n\nLa nostra prossima iterazione del protocollo, Optimism: Bedrock, introdurrà Cannon, la next-gen EVM equivalente fault proof. Quando Bedrock sarà implementato, la differenza tra Optimism e il geth upstream sarà ridotta di altre 300 linee di codice circa. Bedrock e Cannon sbaraglieranno la competizione e setteranno lo standard per l’architettura rollup ottimistica.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dMQJfxb1J2ZA7IcIuo7QM.png?height=134&width=443)\n\n**CRESCERE L’ECOSISTEMA**\n\n**L’Optimism network è ora pronto a supportare un vero ecosistema.**\n\nNel dicembre del 2021, abbiamo rimosso la nostra whitelist di sviluppo e aperto il sistema a tutti gli sviluppatori.\n\nDa allora, abbiamo assistito al lancio di più di 50 app su Otimism, che sono risultate in più di 60k ETH spostati su Optimism e più di $900M in value sulla chain. Update come la [calldata compression](https://mobile.twitter.com/optimismPBC/status/1507077884594241547) hanno continuato a migliorare l’esperienza degli utenti e i fee delle transazioni oggi sono il 40% più bassi di quanto lo erano in precedenza.\n\nSiamo costantemente coperti da alcuni degli investitori più rispettati nell’ambiente, cosa che è risultata in un [round di serie B di $150M](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/money-long-team-strong-8526c6943fd7) capitanato da a16z.\n\nIl grosso di questo capitale sarà usato per aggiungere ancora più membri al nostro team. Le energie collettive di questi Optimists saranno dirette a continuare a scalare il presente di Ethereum, e il 100% dei profitti generati saranno donati per capitalizzarne il suo futuro.\n\nAbbiamo già donato $1M al fondo [Retroactive Public Goods](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c), e siamo felici di condividere i nostri piani per continuare a sostenere e crescere questa iniziativa.\n\n**UN NUOVO CAPITOLO**\n\nSono stati un paio d’anni incredibili da quando abbiamo cominciato quest’avventura per costruire la soluzione di scalabilità migliore per Ethereum.\n\nIl network è cresciuto esponenzialmente, e sta diventando migliore giorno dopo giorno. Il nostro bambino ha imparato a camminare, ed è quasi l’ora per lui di correre.\n\nCi stiamo avvicinando alla fine del capitolo e stiamo per cominciarne uno nuovo - un capitolo che riguarda la proprietà collettiva e la governance collettiva.\n\nE si sta avvicinando in fretta.\n\nDi più al riguardo presto™️.\n\n*Disclaimer: si prega di assicurarsi di interagire sempre con i canali ufficiali di Optimism. Ci aspettiamo che un numero di frodi e attori maligni sempre più grande appaia nelle prossime settimane.

{"id": "rTz0SAMYQ_aNeBD9w13FN-OIpCcvhUzSJFtbZdy74S0", "title": "聊聊POAP——如何做一个Web3世界的打卡者", "body": "### 此篇内容涵盖 POAP 的诞生与定义、获得方式 、查看方法 、活动信息与发行、交易平台、如何为 Gnosis 网络充值稳定币 DAI、 常用工具等内容。\n\nPOAP\n\n## 一、POAP 的诞生\n\n在 2019 年的 ETHDenver 会议上，一个名为 POAP 的项目开始崭露头角。 \n 该项目是为 ETH Denver 会议创建的，旨在奖励与会者的出席和对活动的支持。POAP 全称是 Proof of Attendance Protocol，中文译为出席证明协议。\n\nPOAP 是一个以 ERC-721 为标准，由以太坊开发者社区构建的开源协议，目的是为了创造一种可靠的链上记录经历的新方式。\n\nPOAP 本质上是 NFT，但不是所有的 NFT 都叫 POAP。要成为POAP，该 NFT 必须发行自 POAP 官方的智能合约（0x22c1f6050e56d2876009903609a2cc3fef83b415）。此外，POAP 需要具有自定义图像并包含特定时间和事件的元数据等信息。\n\n最初 POAP 建立在以太坊主网上，但以太坊网络拥堵导致铸造、发行、领取以及交易的成本高昂。因此在 2020年，开发团队把 POAP 添加到了 xDAI 网络（一个采用侧链方案实现扩容的 Layer2 方案，后与 Gnosis 合并，下面统称为 Gnosis 网络），这样 POAP 的领取和交易实现了大幅的降费提速，参与门槛也就大大降低了。\n\n## 二、POAP 的获得\n\n用户可以通过参加线上或线下的各种活动，来获得可扫描的 POAP 二维码或链接；或者在出席的某个场景中到达特定位置来领取 POAP；或者可以通过提供电子邮件地址或者填写表格，领取到 POAP；也可以通过官方提供的 Secret word 在手机 APP 中进行铸造。\n\n用户的 POAP 收集，可以被视为高度可靠和去中心化的履历象征，每个成功发行的 POAP 都将提高所有 POAP 持有者的集体身份的凝聚力和有效性。\n\n通过将 POAP 视为一个去中心化的身份集合，用户和项目方不断的赋予这种数字徽章更多的实际意义和价值，持有某一种 POAP，证明了你出席了某种活动，代表了对项目方的一种支持，这种“与会”的经历本身就是社区生态治理的一环，那么，未来你就可能获得项目方的赋能。\n\n随着 POAP 的流行程度越来越高，这些闪闪发亮、造型各异的圆形图片成为了用户打卡 Web3 世界不可或缺的指标。\n\n更多的 SocialFi 平台也把 POAP 与其他 NFT 一并展示在用户的个人主页（如 lensfrens 和 Cyberconnect ），使得互相关注的用户们更加容易获得身份的认同感。\n\n## 三、POAP 浏览器的使用\n\n### 1、POAP 浏览器（explore.poap.xyz）\n\n这是我个人最中意的浏览器，打开后连接钱包，即可看到按照时间顺序排列的 POAP 列表，可以显示到具体的日期。 当你在交易平台上通过购买来搜集 POAP 时，这种按照具体日期展示的模式就派上了大用场，你可以根据 POAP 的发行时间来迅速确认自己是否持有此 POAP（确认的次数多了，颇有点玩儿连连看的感觉）。\n\nPOAP 浏览器1\n\n[POAP Explorer](https://explore.poap.xyz/)\n\n[ProofOfAttendanceProtocol](https://explore.poap.xyz/)\n\n[explore.poap.xyz](https://explore.poap.xyz/)\n\n查看 POAP\n\n点击要具体查看的 POAP，可以显示出其具体信息，包括该系列的发行日期、总量、你持有POAP 的序列、发行方的相关信息等，甚至还在 POAP 图像上打出了 ID 编码和持有地址（支持 ENS）——贴心的小小细节。\n\n### 2、官网浏览器（app.poap.xyz）\n\n第二种是使用官网的浏览器来查看 POAP，同样连接钱包进行查看，同时还可以手动输入其他地址来进行查看。POAP 列表同样是按照时间顺序进行排列，但是只显示到年份，页面也单调呆板。\n\nPOAP 浏览器2\n\n但官方浏览器自带一个非常重要且独特的屠龙之技，就是 POAP 的迁移。\n\n在浏览器上选择你要迁移的 POAP，点击后（除了图片，POAP 的其他相关信息并没有显示，差评），向下滚动到 “Migrate POAP” 按钮来启动迁移，此时系统会要求你确认交易。 \n 迁移时必须支付相关的 gas 费用（gas 15 的时候，显示费用为 220 U，大离谱事件）才能将 POAP 迁移到主网。迁移后的 POAP 可以在 Opensea 上进行查看和交易。\n\nPOAP 迁移\n\n[POAP - The bookmarks of your life](https://app.poap.xyz/)\n\n[Your collection of Non Fungible Tokens minted by POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) is the best way to keep a visual diary of your life events.](https://app.poap.xyz/)\n\n[app.poap.xyz](https://app.poap.xyz/)\n\n### 3、使用移动端 APP 进行查看\n\n在手机应用市场搜索 “POAP” 下载即可。 \n 连接钱包，然后就可以在初始页面看到自己的 POAP 列表，同样也可以输入其他地址进行POAP 查看。\n\n连接钱包\n\nPOAP 列表同样是按照时间顺序进行排列，但是只显示到月份（所以我还是最青睐第一款浏览器）。\n\nPOAP列表\n\n这里还有个很重要的功能：点击屏幕右下角的 “Mint”，在弹出的菜单里选择 “Secret word”。 当你参加某个活动时，活动方可能会通过给出 Secret word 来进行 POAP 的发放。这个时候你只需要即时输入官方 Secret word，就能 Mint 到一个 POAP，非常简便。\n\n但是正是因为过于简便，而且 POAP 数量有限，这也成了最需要用户拼手速的一种领取方式，我不知道是不是抢 POAP 的用户都单身多年，但迄今为止我还没有见过 Secret word 公布后，POAP 两分钟内还有剩余的。\n\nSecret word\n\n点击你的 POAP 列表，跟第一款浏览器展示结果类似，同样可以看到 POAP 的相关信息。\n\n同时屏幕下方还有个更惊喜的功能设计，让你迅速找到组织。\n\nPOAP信息\n\n点击 “You and 47 more were there”。页面跳转，出现持有该 POAP 的所有地址，右侧的 “Power” 则表示该地址目前持有 POAP 总量，你瞬间就找到家人们了，虽然素未谋面且匿名存在。 \n 你也可以跟这些家人们度长絜大，比权量力，看看谁更加 Powerful，又或是你的哪一款 POAP 也被众多鲸鱼地址们收藏了。\n\nPower of POAP\n\n### 4、使用 POAPin 进行查看\n\n[POAPin](https://poap.in/)\n\n[POAPin](https://poap.in/)\n\n[poap.in](https://poap.in/)\n\nPOAPin 也是一个相对不错的浏览器工具，是由第三方研发团队Glory Lab操刀的产品（推特号：@glorylaboratory），该产品有 Web 版和移动版两种可供选择，另外这个名字我很喜欢，POAPin 的谐音是 “Pop in”，意为突然访问！\n\n相较于其他几款浏览器，POAPin 还列出了 POAPs 和 Events 两组数据，前者表示地址中的POAP 总量，后者表示持有的不同 POAP 总量，后者往往大于前者，因为可能某一款 POAP是你心头所爱（有升值潜力），你搜集了不止 1 枚。\n\n除了常规展示 POAP 之外，POAPin 还提供了丰富筛选功能，包括发行数量、时间、地域等选项。在右上角的 Topics 里，POAPin 列出了各种活动，但是内容信息跟官网的 Event 相去何止倍徙，大家看看就好。\n\nWeb版 POAPin\n\n移动版 POAPin\n\n### 5、使用小狐狸钱包进行查看\n\n写这部分内容完全是为了教程的完整性，因为可操作性极差。 \n 想要在 MetaMask 上查看所有 POAP，需要一个一个查找并添加 POAP 的 ID，此举极为麻烦，并不推荐。感兴趣的（闲的难受的）可以查看下面的链接教程。\n\n[Please Wait... | Cloudflare](https://tomso11.medium.com/how-to-see-your-poaps-on-metamask-bb85a82c617d)\n\n[Completing the CAPTCHA proves you are a human and gives you temporary access to the web property.](https://tomso11.medium.com/how-to-see-your-poaps-on-metamask-bb85a82c617d)\n\n[tomso11.medium.com](https://tomso11.medium.com/how-to-see-your-poaps-on-metamask-bb85a82c617d)\n\n## 四、POAP 活动与 POAP 发行\n\n[POAP - The bookmarks of your life](https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events)\n\n[Your collection of Non Fungible Tokens minted by POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) is the best way to keep a visual diary of your life events.](https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events)\n\n[app.poap.xyz](https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events)\n\n### 1、POAP 活动信息\n\n在官网同样可以查看到最新的 POAP 活动，大家可以按图索骥、有针对性的去参加各种活动，打卡搜集。也可以参加 POAP 的相关社区获取信息。POAP 的官方 DC 目前不接受用户邀请的用户，大家可以加入另一个影响力不俗的社区：POAPapthon（discord.gg/6XYWB5YeD3），其实信息都是相通的，尤其是有大量的我这种热衷于信息分享的人（好事者）存在；推上也有不少 POAP 爱好者在分享信息，也可以关注一下。\n\n### 2、创建 POAP\n\n点击右上角的 “Create new POAP”，也可以申请为自己的活动创立一个 POAP。\n\nPOAP Events\n\n这里需要输入各种申请信息，包括创建目的、城市、发行和截止日期、选择 POAP 模板，上传 POAP 素材，以及发行数量等，提交后等待官方审核即可。\n\n## 五、POAO 交易平台\n\nPOAP 交易的平台主要由 Opensea 和 Epor，Opensea仅支持以太主网 POAP，不做赘述；\n\nEpro 是目前支持 Gnosis 的最大的 POAP 交易平台，使用 DAI 稳定币作为交易媒介。\n\n[Eporio: The sustainable marketplace for NFT \\[Non Fungible Tokens\\]](https://epor.io/browse?type=listings&network=xDai&collection=poap)\n\n[Trade NFTs like POAP or create your own CryptoArt while enjoying some of the lowest fees in the crypto world.](https://epor.io/browse?type=listings&network=xDai&collection=poap)\n\n[epor.io](https://epor.io/browse?type=listings&network=xDai&collection=poap)\n\n进入平台后，一定在 “Collection” 中选择 “POAP” 选项，这样才能买到官方合约发布的POAP，因为其他的 Collection 存在高仿现象，比如现在炙手可热的小狐狸会议的 POAP（持有此 POAP 可以获得小狐狸官方的赋能，比如说代币空投），就存在其他系列的仿盘，购买时一定要确认好右下角的 “POAP” logo。\n\nPOAP交易平台\n\n同时平台也提供了筛选功能，可以查看最近上架的 POAP，或者某个 POAP 系列的挂单以及销售情况等。\n\n筛选功能\n\n点击屏幕右上方的头像，进入个人主页，可以在这里查看自己的持有 POAP ，这也算是第 6 种浏览 POAP 的方法，只是粗糙到让人难以忘怀。\n\n我个人认为 Epor 除了交易，最重要的功能是 POAP 的发送功能。\n\n个人信息\n\n在个人主页点击 “SEND TOKENS”，跳转后可以进入发送页面，通过输入接受地址、POAP 合约地址（再说一次，所有的 POAP 都来自同一个合约地址），POAP 的 ID 等来完成信息录入。\n\n请注意，如果你要批量发送 POAP，就可以持续添加，然后打包成一笔交易（gas 为 0.1 DAI），我每次做 POAP 抽奖活动都必然使用此功能。\n\n批量发送功能\n\n## 六、如何为 Gnosis 网络充值稳定币 DAI\n\n要交易，就要在 Gnosis 网络上充值 DAI，这是一个入门级教程，有不同的充值版本，涵盖一些潜力平台的交互。\n\n首先在小狐狸钱包中添加 Gnosis 网络：\n\n[Chainlist](https://chainlist.defillama.com/zh)\n\n[Connect to Add a Network to you Wallet. Checkout Latency of multiple RPC Providers of a Network](https://chainlist.defillama.com/zh)\n\n[chainlist.defillama.com](https://chainlist.defillama.com/zh)\n\n添加 Gnosis网络\n\n### 1、直接购买\n\n如果你想尽快充值到位，那可以在币安等交易所购买 DAI； \n 然后提币到 BSC 网络（gas为 0.8 DAI）； \n 再通过 Connext 将 BSC 网络上的 DAI 跨链转入 Gnosis。\n\n夹带私货：币安注册链接（享受最优交易折扣）：<https://accounts.binance.com/zh-CN/register?ref=412566990>\n\n如果你除了充值之外，还想多体验一下跨链，多交互一些网络和平台，搏一搏空投福利的可能性，那也可以试试下面两个版本：\n\n### 2、交互版1：\n\n将 FTX 或其他平台中的 ETH 经由 Arb 网络（免费）转出； \n 在 Orbiter 上将 ETH 跨链到 Polygon； \n 在小狐狸中将 Polygon 上的 ETH 兑换成 DAI ； \n 通过 Connext 中将 Polygon 的 DAI 转入 Gnosis。\n\n夹带私货：FTX 注册链接（享受最优交易折扣）：<https://coinmarketcap.com/invite?ref=RXO7ERBV>\n\n### 3、交互版2：\n\n通过虫洞，将 SOL、BSC、以太主网上的资产转入 Polygon； \n 通过 Quickswap 或者小狐狸自带的 Swap，将 Polygon 上的资产兑换成 DAI ； \n 通过 Connext 将 DAI 从跨链转入 Gnosis。\n\n重要提示： \n 使用虫洞时，尽量选择稳定币跨链操作，避免在跨链后兑换原生资产时，官方兑换池中的Wrapped 资产不足，如果你完全看不懂这条提示，不建议使用虫洞跨链。\n\n上述各路径中涉及到的平台官网如下，避免迷路和被钓鱼：\n\nPancake：<https://pancakeswap.finance/> \n 虫洞：<https://portalbridge.com/#/transfer>（串联多个生态的跨链桥，已融资，未发币） \n Connext：[https://bridge.connext.network](https://bridge.connext.network/) \n Quickswap：<https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap> \n Orbiter：[https://orbiter.finance](https://orbiter.finance/)（二层网络跨链潜力平台，未发币）\n\n## 七、其他常用的 POAP 工具\n\n除了上文提到的各种 POAP 浏览器和交易平台之外，还有两个重要的工具必须要 cue 到。\n\n### 1、Earnifi\n\n用来查看漏领 POAP 以及参加抽奖活动的工具。\n\n[Earnifi | Find Crypto Airdrops](https://earni.fi/)\n\n[Earnifi is an airdrop checker. Search for unclaimed airdrops and get notifications for new crypto. Enter your address to see tokens, NFTs, and POAPs today!](https://earni.fi/)\n\n[earni.fi](https://earni.fi/)\n\n使用邮箱注册账号，可以定期收到推送消息，包括你漏领取的 POAP 和其他的 raffle（抽奖）活动。\n\n添加地址\n\n成功注册后，需要点击右上角 “Account” ，进入个人账户，这里你需要在页面中部的 “Bundled Wallet” 选项中，添加要查看的地址，建议先添加自己的地址，也可以再添加其他你想关注的地址。 \n 添加完毕后，可以看到有哪些 POAP 是待领取的，以及有哪些抽奖活动是可以参加的。\n\n点击下方的 “Raffle Ticket”，页面跳转至抽奖页面，可以看到屏幕下方 “Eligible POAPs” 中列举了一些 POAP，这意味着你的地址必须至少持有这些 POAP 中的一个，才可以参加活动。点击 “Join Raffle” 即可。\n\n你也可以自己创建抽奖活动，指定某些 POAP 的持有者来一起狂欢一下（空欢喜一下）。\n\n抽奖页面\n\n### 2、Dune\n\n这个工网站很多人都耳熟能详，这里其实也是查看 POAP 宏观信息的一个重要手段。\n\n[Dune](https://dune.com/greywizard/sgc-work?Address)\n\n[Blockchain ecosystem analytics by and for the community. Explore and share data from Ethereum, xDai, Polygon, Optimism, BSC and Solana for free.](https://dune.com/greywizard/sgc-work?Address)\n\n[dune.com](https://dune.com/greywizard/sgc-work?Address)\n\n进入到 Dashboard 页面，可以看到 POAP 的基本数据，比如目前持有 POAP 的地址个数为 856, 525；Gnosis 侧链以及以太主网上 POAP 数量的增长趋势等。\n\n在左上角绿线处输入你的地址，就可以看到目前的世界排名（Your Rank）。\n\n右侧两个数据栏分别列出了 POAP 地址的前 100 名，这里也可以看出绝大多数的发行、交易都发生在 Gnosis。\n\n要着重强调的是，这个排名的依据并不是地址中 POAP 的绝对数量，而是 “POAP Txs”，即为POAP 的交易次数，包括你每次参加活动的领取、购买次数的集合。所以很多人民币玩家在交易平台批量的购买大量 POAP 或者私下交易某个地址内的所有 POAP 时，其排名未必靠前。\n\n相较于手机 APP POAP 中的 Power 概念，我认为这个排名的设计理念其实更贴合“出席证明”的初衷，结果固然重要（POAP 数量），但是经历的过程更重要（POAP Txs）。\n\n一个钱包地址中的净资产很关键，很容易在 Web3 世界营造出追捧效应，会有无数的用户借助各种工具来追踪、监测、分析地址中的资产动向，以此作为自己投资的风向标。\n\n但是这个地址在 Web3 中的足迹呢？每一步操作、每一次交互的历程呢？我认为这些也很重要，这一串符码背后的庞大数据也是无上的财富。\n\n当你在浏览器里凝视这一笔笔的经年累月的交易哈希时，当你凭借多年的混迹与闯荡，获取一枚枚的 Badge 时（如 Noox），你会说，这么多年来我一直在，在这个饱受主流社会诋毁的超前领域，在这个曾为大众避之唯恐不及的原始丛林里，我坚持做自己，没有停止过步伐。这些哈希带给你的历练和经验，早就超过了资产的实际价值与意义。\n\nDashboard of POAP", "timestamp": 1653391200, "digest": "s_BxCOkX46oNmIIKKf1jkS94LoAK6opeb8bn2QkbgNA", "contributor": "0x44821E910e6b53B6c9a416abAd4Ec40e35463DEC"}

风险提示\n\n**请一定不要用主钱包去Mint, 创建一个新钱包, 放里一些gas费用就可以了.**\n\n**如果在Mint过程中出现让你授权的就要小心, 一般只是需要签名, 不要授权.**\n\n**有一些NFT在Mint后是不能上架Opensea的, 遇到这种,要么你提前有时间去先查一下, 要么你就认了.**\n\n**如果不小心授权了. 请尽快取消授权.什么?不会取消授权?私聊我我教你.**\n\n\n---\n\n## 背景\n\n我的[Freemint](https://twitter.com/free_mint_bot) 播报[机器人](https://twitter.com/free_mint_bot)已经运行了一段时间, 每天都能打到金狗, 每天都有人问我如何Mint?\n\n**如果你还没关注, 请先关注FreeMint播报机器人推特:** [twitter.com/free_mint_bot](http://twitter.com/free_mint_bot)\n\n**然后点亮小铃铛!**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LS8jLP41NeJfyqLQozCnY.png?height=1460&width=1136)\n\n那么如何Mint呢? 如果你一直关注我: [twitter.com/zlexdl](http://twitter.com/zlexdl) ,一直学习的话, 我觉得你很轻松就能找到答案.\n\n在我发的 <<使用RSS筛选币圈有用的信息>>文章中, 教会你了如何掌握币圈的大量信息.\n\n只要简单的搜索一下关键词就能轻松找到答案, 可惜没几个人这么做吧.\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/zlexdl.eth/CZR_mSfTNm0vfPdx1YDTi0zaM-X1vxeURz_f8078RrM](https://mirror.xyz/zlexdl.eth/CZR_mSfTNm0vfPdx1YDTi0zaM-X1vxeURz_f8078RrM)\n\n\n---\n\n**言归正传, 说一下如何mint, mint 有三种途径.**\n\n### 第一种: 使用官方直接mint\n\n这一种,我想大家都会吧, 如果不会的话, 那就退圈吧.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HQdjDvA1Du1dtMThePZwt.png?height=1524&width=1126)\n\n链接Metamask小狐狸, 直接点击mint按钮,如果没有售空, 并且没有限制的话,就可以mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E3qFRSXE8Ap9fkFgqbOAg.png?height=1030&width=1422)\n\n**注意:很多合约是前多少名额是免费Mint的, 这样的我的机器人也会检测出来, 不要到时候来问我为什么不是免费的你还要发呢.**\n\n\n---\n\n### 第二种: 利用合约Mint\n\n有一些人就问我, 为啥机器人发的一些mint信息没有Website啊?\n\n因为这些图狗根本就没准备Website, 都是为了捞一波就跑的.\n\n这种情况就需要我们进行合约Mint.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zE-C75sLppsbc1UszgHWX.png?height=1734&width=1127)\n\n点击Etherscan后的链接之后就会看到以下画面.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lw9EXCrebONr8jduejln5.png?height=1632&width=2066)\n\n每个合约都不太一样, 如果你懂开发的话, 可以去 点击Code 按钮去看看代码,\n\n当然如果你开发的话, 你就不用看这篇文章了.\n\n具体Mint 步骤\n\n**1. 点击Connect to Web3 按钮去连接Metamask小狐狸钱包.**\n\n成功之后是这样的:\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oQejgwHZdYiTedqC8psX.png?height=405&width=783)\n\n**2.一般方法区都会有Mint ,FreeMint, MintTo, publicMint或是其他带有mint的方法.**\n\n点击 1.FreeMint之后, 可以看到以下画面.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TpoC9xQupn5nNSKxCWctV.png?height=499&width=504)\n\n因为是免费Mint ,所以单价输入框要输入0, 数量输入你喜欢的, 但是这个经常会有限制, 有的是每个地址只能mint一个, 有的是每个地址只能mint10个, 每个合约都不太一样.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qaGBxKfjvAMsOV-orEUQ1.png?height=581&width=676)\n\n**3. 输入好之后点击Write按钮就可以mint了, 如果符合各种条件就会成功的.**\n\n但是当出现以下画面时就放弃吧, 如果你钱多可以给直接发给我.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PHnHgNn18ej8y-fasJ2pP.png?height=382&width=500)\n\n另外: 当你不知道哪个方法是可以mint的呢, 例如以下这个合约的方法, 找不出合适的mint方法\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rApKQ1jIsYFX6eUQAxB4R.png?height=1136&width=515)\n\n你就可以Transactions页面看看其他人都用什么方法.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NwaW7wyn2S7EDhhQd96LR.png?height=905&width=976)\n\n然后会再回到刚才的方法页面去试试, 就可以了.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/W0E0AJLSe_b2uyFnlJ3Wq.png?height=1038&width=1068)\n\n\n---\n\n### 第三种: 跟单Mint\n\n跟单Mint也叫十六进位数据Mint.\n\n就是使用其他人已经Mint的Input Data(十六进位数据)去mint.\n\n**准备工作:**\n\nMetamask小狐狸的【设置】-【高级】-【显示十六进制数据】点击成**启用**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wlvdOsj43Wwli2VQiUVcj.png?height=909&width=551)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gUbOTu_AQy_yFWtZwnBUz.png?height=903&width=553)\n\n在第二种方法已经说了, 先去Transactions页面去看其他人的传输记录.\n\n**去Transactions页面找到近期已经成功Mint并且Value为0的传输, 点击进去**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gywPQUMMi9tLclSPx62_c.png?height=960&width=2068)\n\n可以看出这个记录mint了4个, 那么你如果使用他Input data也会mint4个的, 这点需要注意.\n\n当然也不是没有办法修改的, 但是需要时间, 等你改完了就来不及了, 反正都是免费的.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BXLchbA72CX-RPHJCGja3.png?height=1682&width=1606)\n\n点击上图中左下角的 **Click to see More** 按钮后, 点击**View Input AS**后选择**Original**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/siHeRkhE72bAxmK2KvMHj.png?height=1047&width=1466)\n\n复制红框中的字符串\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3YG3HbQhlReGP53Thr1eB.png?height=396&width=1571)\n\n一定是项目合约地址，不是项目方地址, 千万别选错了,要不然就浪费gas了.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pKWxTzKQP1E-r-OmGj317.png?height=858&width=1357)\n\n这个也是合约地址.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/y6gl5P0YYuqc4K5LuKwNx.png?height=154&width=959)\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6dhWEFPFh8Bq6v-tWFHnC.png?height=1608&width=636)\n\nMatamask小狐狸钱包的主界面点击

If you don’t want to spend hundreds of dollars’ worth of ETH each time you mint or trade an NFT, you can enjoy and explore new forms of creative expression and value creation.\n\nIn short, Kiwii offers a world in which NFTs can be used for more than just trading — with all the composability of Ethereum, minus the high fees.\n\n## Coming soon: Fly over your NFTs like a Kiwii bird\n\nAs one of the first products launched out of SkunkDAO, Nahmii’s Web3 startup incubator, Kiwii enables users to engage with Nahmii’s ecosystem like never before.\n\nNext on the roadmap is the addition of NFT transfers via the [Nahmii Bridge.](http://bridge.nahmii.io/) Using the Nahmii Bridge, anyone will be able to port existing ERC-721 and ERC1155 tokens to Kiwii and begin trading them on an entirely new market. At any point, these assets can also be sent back to the Ethereum network for hosting and trading there.\n\nThe implications of Kiwii’s low cost and near-instant NFT deployments are limitless, and these opportunities as well as the variety of NFTs available will continue to grow as new user-friendly-features are introduced to Kiwii. And while we’re thrilled to see a growing demand for NFT collectibles, Kiwii gives you the opportunity to launch and seed NFTs for high-throughput and complex dApps in the realms of online gaming, DeFi-NFT projects, and beyond.\n\nIn short, Kiwii enables everyone to participate in the Cambrian explosion of creativity and excitement that NFTs offer, and we look forward to seeing you Kiwii up the NFT scene!\n\nBe sure to follow [Kiwii Marketplace](https://twitter.com/KiwiiDAO) and [Kiwii Labs](https://twitter.com/KiwiiLabs) on Twitter and[ join Nahmii’s Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/GKTsUTH) and [Kiwii Discord Community](https://discord.gg/mc7Qd39rew) for the latest updates.\n", "timestamp": 1653392204, "digest": "joflbku8okL7U-xX6km6-_ymKOPdEJ6lwrrtAfqStbY", "contributor": "0x16901FB8b49DC8b35371e9511Caa8524e2418ee0"}

{"id": "aOgmLt97QFFITFjKlF0hiN4jgF6NQu6zvPQv7id7yX8", "title": "Nuevo Whitepaper de KCS", "body": "KCC, KCS y Kucoin como un nuevo eje para la adopción del blockchain.\n\nLa KCS Foundation Managment, ha revelado en su libro blanco todos los detalles esenciales sobre KuCoin Token (KCS), y con ello, la gran visión para el ecosistema en general y cómo encaja en el panorama mayor de la criptodivisa.\n\n.\n\n## KuCoin, KCC, KCS\n\nKuCoin y el token nativo KCS se han convertido en una parte fundamental del espacio de la criptodivisa desde 2017, ganándose un lugar en el entorno. La plataforma y el ecosistema de KCS han crecido a medida que el blockchain ha pasado de 1.0 a 2.0 y ahora se está preparando para convertirse en la columna vertebral del movimiento de la Web 3.0.\n\nEl exchange de KuCoin da servicio a más de 200 países diferentes en todo el mundo, cotizando más de 600 monedas diferentes, y tiene cientos de miles de millones en volumen de operaciones acumulado para demostrarlo. El ecosistema KCS de la compañía no tiene fronteras y va más allá de lo básico de la compra y venta de criptodivisas, aportando un valor sin precedentes al sector.\n\nKCS ha sido un token de contrato inteligente ERC20 en la cadena Ethereum desde 2017 y migró a KuCoin Community Chain (abreviado KCC) en 2021. Como el token nativo de la cadena KCC, KCS sirve como gas para la capa base del ecosistema KCC. El suministro total está bloqueado en 200 millones de tokens KCS, y la tokenomía deflacionaria está diseñada para destruir KCS a través de la quema de tokens, lo que eventualmente llevará el suministro total a 100 millones de tokens KCS.\n\nLos titulares de KCS son responsables del crecimiento de KuCoin y, por lo tanto, son recompensados con varios incentivos, como descuentos en las tarifas y la participación en las ofertas iniciales de tokens. Combinados, el crecimiento de los usuarios y la innovación de KCS han ayudado a impulsar a KuCoin entre las cinco principales plataformas de activos digitales del mundo y han colocado a KCS entre los 100 principales proyectos de criptografía por capitalización de mercado en todo el mundo.\n\nDe cara al futuro, KuCoin pretende aprovechar su influencia y alcance para ampliar el ecosistema KCS y hacerlo más accesible para todos.\n\nLas tres fases del desarrollo de la cadena comunitaria KuCoin \n Construir un proyecto ambicioso desde cero no es sencillo y lleva tiempo conseguir que todo sea correcto y completar las pruebas adecuadas. Por lo tanto, las mejoras de la cadena KCC y el ecosistema KCS.\n\n**Fase 1.0** \n La mainnet de KCC se lanzó por primera vez en junio de 2021. Desde su creación, la cadena ha superado los millones de transacciones en algunas de las aplicaciones DeFi, GameFi o Web 3.0 más importantes de la actualidad. KCC 1.0 se basa en el código fuente de Ethereum y es totalmente compatible con los contratos inteligentes de la máquina virtual de Ethereum. Sin embargo, se presenta como una solución a los problemas de escalabilidad y a las elevadas comisiones que supone hacer negocios en Ethereum.\n\n**Fase 2.0** \n KCC 2.0 busca incorporar subrutinas internas para ampliar la potencia potencial del hardware sin sacrificar la compatibilidad con la Máquina Virtual de Ethereum. La actualización también aumentará el límite de gas de los bloques a 500 millones. KCC 2.0 también aprovechará tres tecnologías únicas: StormingEVM, LightningADS y RainingDB.\n\n**Fase 3.0** \n KCC 3.0 comienza a desplegar la compatibilidad entre cadenas en todo el ecosistema para interactuar con múltiples cadenas y activos. Esta fase del desarrollo de KCC también se centra en el desarrollo de una infraestructura adecuada para el uso y el desarrollo a gran escala, la construcción de una capa 2 de menor coste, un SDK de KCC que permite a los desarrolladores desarrollar protocolos intracadena e intercadena con mayor privacidad; En términos de un ecosistema intercadena, KCC apoyará gradualmente la transferencia intercadena de múltiples activos, apoyará DeFi intercadena, juegos, ecosistemas Web3.0 y cuentas intercadena.\n\nCuando se complete la fase 3.0, KCC se convertirá en una solución viable todo en uno que atenderá a todos los sectores de la industria de la cadena de bloques y las criptomonedas, con soporte para futuras categorías a medida que vayan surgiendo.\n\nEn el futuro, KCS también planea construir un sistema de pago propio para apoyar los pagos sin fronteras que están diseñados para servir a millones de usuarios, un ecosistema masivo de la Web 3.0, y mucho más.\n\nSimplemente quiere convertirse en el eje FIAT-Descentralización que como movimiento natural se está desarrollando este entorno.\n\n## De los geeks a la adopción masiva: GoDAO y el ecosistema KCS\n\nCon el objetivo de la adopción masiva en mente, se formó la Fundación KCC GoDAO junto con la comunidad GoDAO. La comunidad GoDAO está formada por miembros del intercambio KuCoin y desarrolladores del ecosistema KCS. Juntos, este equipo central ayuda a gestionar la organización y a gobernar la metodología que rodea el desarrollo.\n\nLos miembros del equipo se centrarán en la investigación y el desarrollo para apoyar un mayor crecimiento de la infraestructura de KCC, proporcionar liquidez a los protocolos de asociación, financiar la innovación de blockchain y el liderazgo de pensamiento, y conectar los recursos dentro del ecosistema KCS.\n\nMás adelante, la fundación cambiará hacia un desarrollo más autónomo y basado en la comunidad que se dirija totalmente en base a la gobernanza de los usuarios.\n\n## KCS Tokenomics:\n\nExamen del mecanismo de distribución y deflación \n Como se ha señalado, la oferta total de KCS es de 200 millones de tokens. 100 millones de tokens se asignaron a los primeros participantes en septiembre de 2017 sin un período de bloqueo inicial. 65 millones de tokens fueron para el fundador y los miembros del equipo con un período de bloqueo de cuatro años. Otros 25 millones se destinaron a asesores e inversores ángeles con un período de bloqueo de dos años, y los 10 millones restantes se liberaron inmediatamente para las recompensas de la comunidad KCS.\n\nKCS redistribuirá los 90 millones de KCS bloqueados en el momento de la emisión, de los cuales 20 millones de KCS se quemarán directamente. El ecosistema KCC generará valor para los poseedores de tokens mediante la agregación de varias aplicaciones relacionadas con la Web 3.0 a través de DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, etc.\n\nLa plataforma de comercio de KuCoin recomprará regularmente KCS del mercado secundario con una parte de los ingresos de la plataforma para seguir reduciendo la oferta mediante la quema de tokens y aumentar el valor para los poseedores de tokens. Además, KCS introducirá el EIP1559, centrado en el mecanismo de comisiones de KCC.\n\nA partir de aquí, KCS entrará en la segunda etapa de desarrollo. KCS se convertirá en el puente que fortalezca la relación simbiótica entre el ecosistema centralizado de KuCoin y el ecosistema descentralizado de KCC.

And the number of crypto owners is expected to grow from [295 million to 1 billion](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hfgyig42jimx/5i8TeN1QYJDjn82pSuZB5S/85c7c9393f3ee67e456ec780f9bf11e3/Cryptodotcom_Crypto_Market_Sizing_Jan2022.pdf) by the end of 2022. The metrics from some companies operating in this space raised my attention to further dive in, like Kryll.io which managed to reach [+$3.5 billion traded volumes in April 2022](https://blog.kryll.io/kryll-changelog-monthly-progress-report-april-2022-metrics/) and operate/use across 112 countries. Or Zignaly, the profit-sharing/copy-trading platform gathers +55K users and manages +$60M AUM through API-linked crypto trading accounts up to date.\n\n### The Market Drivers\n\nAlthough the industry has seen some innovation over the past decade, it still remains fundamentally conservative given the nature of the business. In my opinion, the structural changes and new technologies applied to finance will be key drivers of AMaaS :\n\n·        First and foremost, the global population is getting more educated about the Financial Market and the basics of Personal Finance. The multiplication of trading apps and neo-banks offering stock/crypto investing products depict this new generation's willingness to keep full control and ownership over their financial assets. According to [The Motley Fool survey 2021](https://www.fool.com/research/what-are-gen-z-millennial-investors-buying/), 73% of Gen Z investors and 66% of millennial investors own stocks, and unsurprisingly, 40% of stock investors aged 18 to 40 own cryptocurrencies. It demonstrates a growing interest in the financial industry, Charles Swab talks now about the [“Generation I(nvestor)”.](https://www.aboutschwab.com/generation-investor-study-2021)\n\n·        The decentralization of Investment Management knowledge outside of the banking/hedge fund industry and the growing individual/independent investor community across social networks largely participate in the change of the Asset Management landscape. The episode of [Reddit’s traders vs HFs](https://www.ft.com/content/7a91e3ea-b9ec-4611-9a03-a8dd3b8bddb5), or the [anonymous Twitter user explaining step by step how to break Terra](https://twitter.com/FreddieRaynolds/status/1463960623402913797) in Nov. 2021,  illustrates the capacity of some retail investors to research/act like \"professional\" investors. The community aspect and knowledge sharing play a crucial role in the Future of Asset Management: favoriting the \"multiplayer\" and \"community-belonging\" sentiment lead to higher engagement. A16Z addresses better the community-first social investing topic in the \"[Big ideas that fintech will tackle in 2022](https://a16z.com/2021/12/20/the-big-ideas-that-fintech-will-tackle-in-2022/#:\\~:text=In%202022%2C%20we'll%20see,fiat%20and%20crypto%20financial%20lives)” post. Additionally, the myriad of FinMeme/StockMeme accounts genuinely outline the exponential factor of Community in the global financial industry.\n\n·        Aforementioned above, trading platforms blossoming over the past years have upside down the traditional investing/trading market by granting commission-free, low-capital access, and fractional shares trading. The financial market consumerization and the democratization of retail investing activities play a subsequent stake in the emergence of AMaaS, as well as, participate in the popularization of new investment instruments, like NFTs or cryptocurrencies. Technical innovations applied to Financial Services – like APIs, Blockchain, Bots, or AI/ML – are the main drivers of this new market. Quantitative/algorithmic investment strategies are getting more traction within the stock market in the past years (e.g. Two Sigma, Renaissance Technologies…), and automation has become a norm in the Finance industry. APIs can allow anyone to manage your brokerage/trading account with specific restrictions. Blockchain – especially smart contracts – acts as a safeguard/trusted-third party. Bots automize investment strategies while minimizing cognitive biases. Venture investments have started to hit the space, and startups have begun to stand out, such as the US-company Alpaca building a developer-first API for stock/crypto trading that secured [+$70M from VC firms](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/alpaca-raises-50m-to-rapidly-scale-its-equities-trading-api-business/), or Zignaly developing a profit-sharing based copy-trading platform for digital assets raised +$50M.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads me to think of a future where people would easily access  \"plug and play\" alpha-generating services within a few clicks. And anyone would be able to start \"independent\" Asset Management activities with enterprise-grade tools/ infrastructures.\n\n### Applications\n\nFrom my investigation, the AMaaS landscape is growing over the days and attracting more retail and institutional investors. Applications within this space include: marketplaces matching Asset Managers & customers, investment strategy creation/rental/sell/purchase platform, NFT-based asset management, DAO, wallet-2-wallet following, API-based trading infrastructure/web3 infrastructure, and enterprise-grade tools for retail investors/independent Asset Managers. Find below some interesting companies that I have spotted operating in this space.\n\n![Segment mapping](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sw5IVoRmZPCOy1NsK6oZV.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this blog post! if you have any questions and comments, or just want to chat, please feel free to [reach out to me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-chen-t-h-3b40ba122/).

La plataforma y el ecosistema de KCS han crecido a medida que el blockchain ha pasado de 1.0 a 2.0 y ahora se está preparando para convertirse en la columna vertebral del movimiento de la Web 3.0.\n\nEl exchange de KuCoin da servicio a más de 200 países diferentes en todo el mundo, cotizando más de 600 monedas diferentes, y tiene cientos de miles de millones en volumen de operaciones acumulado para demostrarlo. El ecosistema KCS de la compañía no tiene fronteras y va más allá de lo básico de la compra y venta de criptodivisas, aportando un valor sin precedentes al sector.\n\nKCS ha sido un token de contrato inteligente ERC20 en la cadena Ethereum desde 2017 y migró a KuCoin Community Chain (abreviado KCC) en 2021. Como el token nativo de la cadena KCC, KCS sirve como gas para la capa base del ecosistema KCC. El suministro total está bloqueado en 200 millones de tokens KCS, y la tokenomía deflacionaria está diseñada para destruir KCS a través de la quema de tokens, lo que eventualmente llevará el suministro total a 100 millones de tokens KCS.\n\nLos titulares de KCS son responsables del crecimiento de KuCoin y, por lo tanto, son recompensados con varios incentivos, como descuentos en las tarifas y la participación en las ofertas iniciales de tokens. Combinados, el crecimiento de los usuarios y la innovación de KCS han ayudado a impulsar a KuCoin entre las cinco principales plataformas de activos digitales del mundo y han colocado a KCS entre los 100 principales proyectos de criptografía por capitalización de mercado en todo el mundo.\n\nDe cara al futuro, KuCoin pretende aprovechar su influencia y alcance para ampliar el ecosistema KCS y hacerlo más accesible para todos.\n\nLas tres fases del desarrollo de la cadena comunitaria KuCoin \n Construir un proyecto ambicioso desde cero no es sencillo y lleva tiempo conseguir que todo sea correcto y completar las pruebas adecuadas. Por lo tanto, las mejoras de la cadena KCC y el ecosistema KCS.\n\n**Fase 1.0** \n La mainnet de KCC se lanzó por primera vez en junio de 2021. Desde su creación, la cadena ha superado los millones de transacciones en algunas de las aplicaciones DeFi, GameFi o Web 3.0 más importantes de la actualidad. KCC 1.0 se basa en el código fuente de Ethereum y es totalmente compatible con los contratos inteligentes de la máquina virtual de Ethereum. Sin embargo, se presenta como una solución a los problemas de escalabilidad y a las elevadas comisiones que supone hacer negocios en Ethereum.\n\n**Fase 2.0** \n KCC 2.0 busca incorporar subrutinas internas para ampliar la potencia potencial del hardware sin sacrificar la compatibilidad con la Máquina Virtual de Ethereum. La actualización también aumentará el límite de gas de los bloques a 500 millones. KCC 2.0 también aprovechará tres tecnologías únicas: StormingEVM, LightningADS y RainingDB.\n\n**Fase 3.0** \n KCC 3.0 comienza a desplegar la compatibilidad entre cadenas en todo el ecosistema para interactuar con múltiples cadenas y activos. Esta fase del desarrollo de KCC también se centra en el desarrollo de una infraestructura adecuada para el uso y el desarrollo a gran escala, la construcción de una capa 2 de menor coste, un SDK de KCC que permite a los desarrolladores desarrollar protocolos intracadena e intercadena con mayor privacidad; En términos de un ecosistema intercadena, KCC apoyará gradualmente la transferencia intercadena de múltiples activos, apoyará DeFi intercadena, juegos, ecosistemas Web3.0 y cuentas intercadena.\n\nCuando se complete la fase 3.0, KCC se convertirá en una solución viable todo en uno que atenderá a todos los sectores de la industria de la cadena de bloques y las criptomonedas, con soporte para futuras categorías a medida que vayan surgiendo.\n\nEn el futuro, KCS también planea construir un sistema de pago propio para apoyar los pagos sin fronteras que están diseñados para servir a millones de usuarios, un ecosistema masivo de la Web 3.0, y mucho más.\n\nSimplemente quiere convertirse en el eje FIAT-Descentralización que como movimiento natural se está desarrollando este entorno.\n\n## De los geeks a la adopción masiva: GoDAO y el ecosistema KCS\n\nCon el objetivo de la adopción masiva en mente, se formó la Fundación KCC GoDAO junto con la comunidad GoDAO. La comunidad GoDAO está formada por miembros del intercambio KuCoin y desarrolladores del ecosistema KCS. Juntos, este equipo central ayuda a gestionar la organización y a gobernar la metodología que rodea el desarrollo.\n\nLos miembros del equipo se centrarán en la investigación y el desarrollo para apoyar un mayor crecimiento de la infraestructura de KCC, proporcionar liquidez a los protocolos de asociación, financiar la innovación de blockchain y el liderazgo de pensamiento, y conectar los recursos dentro del ecosistema KCS.\n\nMás adelante, la fundación cambiará hacia un desarrollo más autónomo y basado en la comunidad que se dirija totalmente en base a la gobernanza de los usuarios.\n\n## KCS Tokenomics:\n\nExamen del mecanismo de distribución y deflación \n Como se ha señalado, la oferta total de KCS es de 200 millones de tokens. 100 millones de tokens se asignaron a los primeros participantes en septiembre de 2017 sin un período de bloqueo inicial. 65 millones de tokens fueron para el fundador y los miembros del equipo con un período de bloqueo de cuatro años. Otros 25 millones se destinaron a asesores e inversores ángeles con un período de bloqueo de dos años, y los 10 millones restantes se liberaron inmediatamente para las recompensas de la comunidad KCS.\n\nKCS redistribuirá los 90 millones de KCS bloqueados en el momento de la emisión, de los cuales 20 millones de KCS se quemarán directamente. El ecosistema KCC generará valor para los poseedores de tokens mediante la agregación de varias aplicaciones relacionadas con la Web 3.0 a través de DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, etc.\n\nLa plataforma de comercio de KuCoin recomprará regularmente KCS del mercado secundario con una parte de los ingresos de la plataforma para seguir reduciendo la oferta mediante la quema de tokens y aumentar el valor para los poseedores de tokens.

{"id": "vb7NAnb3kpwr2QURWnUJBZTUw7-jXzkxRskrmoQfQ-k", "title": "心智模型", "body": "进化论 我认为很多现代社会现象可以用进化论来解释。有一种理论说，文明的存在是为了回答谁能交配的问题。如果你看看四周，从一个纯粹性选择的角度来看，精液多，卵子少。这是个分配问题。 确实，男性和女性的所有可以追溯到人身上的作品都在试图去解决这个问题。 进化论、热力学、信息论和复杂性理论在生命的许多方面都有解释性和预言的能力。\n\n逆向 我不相信我有能力说什么将会起作用。而是，我试图去排除不会起作用的东西。我认为成功只是不犯错误。它不是关于做正确的判断。而是关于避免错误的判断。\n\n复杂性理论 我从90年代中期就开始研究复杂性理论。我学习得越多，就越是明白我们知识的局限性和预测能力的局限。复杂性理论对我有超级大的帮助。它帮我建立了一个面对无知而运行的系统。我相信我们在根本上是无知的，对未来的预测也是非常非常的糟糕。\n\n经济学 微观经济学和博弈论是基础。我认为，在没有对供求关系、劳动力和资本、博弈论以及那些东西有一个非常好的理解的情况下，你们不可能取得商业上的成功或甚至驾驭我们现代资本主义社会的大部分。 忽略那些噪音。市场会做出决定。\n\n委托-代理问题 对我来说，在微观经济学中，委托-代理问题是最基本的一个问题。如果你不理解委托代理问题，你将不知道如何引导自己在世界中畅行。如果你想建立一家成功的公司或在交易上取得成功，这是重要的。 它是一个非常简单的概念。有句恺撒大帝的名言，“如果你想去做，那就去做。如果你不想，那就派人去做。”他的意思是，如果你想做好，那你必须亲自去做。当你是委托人，那你就是主人——你就会关心并且会把工作做得很好。当你是代理人，你是在为别人的利益做事，你可能会把事情做得很糟糕。你不会太在乎。你会为自己的利益去优化，而不会是为了委托人的利益。 越小的公司，每个人就越能感觉到自己是委托人。你越觉得自己不是代理人，你将会把工作做得更好。 你能把某个人的收益和他所创造的价值联系得越紧密，就越能把他们变成委托人，就越少将他们变成代理人。 我认为在一个核心基础层，我都明白这个。我们被委托人所吸引，我们所有都和委托人有联系，但媒体和现代社会花了大量时间来洗脑你：让你认为需要一个代理人，一个代理人是重要的，以及代理人是知识渊博的。\n\n复利 复利——在金融背景下你们大多数都了解它。如果你不知道，那就打开一本微观经济学教科书去学习吧。从头到尾把一本微观经济学教科书读完是有价值的。 一个复利的例子——假设你每年一美元能赚10%。第一年，你赚10%，最终得到1.1美元。下一年，你能得到1.21美元，再下一年，你得到1.33美元。保持这样增加它自身。如果你以每年30%的复利计算，并持续三十年，最后你就不会只得到十到二十倍的钱——最终你会得到数千倍的钱。 在智力领域，复利规则。当你看到一家有一百多个用户的企业以每个月20%的复利增加用户时，很快很快就能累加到数百万用户。有时，甚至那些公司的创始人对如此大的业务规模感到惊讶。\n\n基础数学 我认为基础数学真的被低估了。如果你想去赚钱，如果你想去投资赚钱，你的基础数学应该是非常好。 如果你仅是去做生意，你不需要去学习几何学、三角学、微积分或任何复杂的数学课程。但你需要算法、概率学和统计学。那些是非常重要的。打开并读透一本基础数学书，确保你真的掌握乘法、除法、复利、概率和统计。\n\n黑天鹅 有一个概率统计的新分支，是真正围绕尾事件的（译者注：尾事件是罕见但有重大影响的事件）。黑天鹅是极端的概率。再次，我不得不再次提及纳西姆.塔勒布，我认为他是我们时代最伟大的哲学家和科学家之一。在这方面，他已经做了很多开创性的工作。\n\n微积分 微积分对于认识和理解变化率和自然界运转很有帮助。但更重要的是理解微积分原理——通过小离散或小连续事件累加来测量变化。求解积分或按需求导是不重要的，因为在商业世界你不需要用到这些。\n\n可证伪性 了解最少，但对于任何声称”科学“站在他们这边的人来说非常重要的原则——可证伪性。如果不能做出可证伪的预测，那它就不是科学。要让你相信某些事情是真的，它应该有预测的能力，并且预测是可证伪的。 我认为宏观经济学已经堕落了，因为它无法做出可证伪的预测（这是科学的特点）。当你研究经济时，你从不需要一个反例。你根本不可能用美国经济同时去做两个不同的经济实验。\n\n如果你无法下决定，就回答否 如果我面对一个困难的选择，像下面这些问题： 我应该和这个人结婚吗？ 我应该做这个工作吗？ 我应该买这间房子吗？ 我应该搬到这个城市吗？ 我应该和这个人合伙做生意吗？ 如果你无法下决定，就回答否。原因是，现代社会充满了选择。有非常多的选择。我们生活在一个有70亿人的星球，我们可以通过互联网联系到每个人。有数十万种职业供你选择。有如此多的选择。 在生物学角度上，你没意识到有很多选择。从历史角度来看，我们一直是在150人的部落中进化的。当有人出现时，他们可能是你对伴侣的唯一选择。\n\n当你选择某些事物时，你会被锁定一段很长的时间。创业可能需要花费10年。你开始一段感情可能需要5年或者更多。你搬到一个城市可能会待上10到20年。这些都是有非常非常长期影响的决定。这些是非常非常重要的，只有在我们十分确定的时候才会说”是“。你从不可能做到绝对确定，但你要做到非常肯定。 如果你发现你自己做了一个关于决定的电子表格，用来列举是和否、利和弊、制衡、为什么是好或坏时......那就忘了它吧。如果你无法做决定，就回答否。\n\n往高处走 简单的启发式算法：如果你在一个困难的决定上有同等程度的分歧，那么就选择在短期内会更痛苦的那条路。 如果你有两个选择，并且是相对均等的选择，那么就选择在短期内更困难和更痛苦的那条路。 实际情况是，其中一条路要承受短期的痛苦。另一条路是在未来在更远的地方才会感到痛苦。然而，你的大脑想要避免冲突而试图去避开短期的痛苦。 按照定义，如果两个选择是差不多的，其中一个有短期痛苦，那么这个选择就和长期收益有关。根据复利法则，长期收益是你想要得到的。你的大脑过于看重短期的幸福，而试图去避免短期的痛苦。 所以你必须在感到痛苦时摆脱这种倾向（它是一种潜意识的倾向）。就像你知道的那样，生命中大多数收益都是来自于短期的痛苦，如此你可以在长期得到回报。 对我来说，健身并不是令人愉快的；在短期内我要受苦，我感觉到痛苦。但从长远来看，我会更好，因为我有肌肉或是我更健康了。 如果我正在读一本书并感觉看不懂，这就像锻炼时，肌肉会感觉到酸痛或疲劳，只不过现在是换作我的大脑不堪重负了。从长远来说，我会变得更聪明，因为我正在我的能力界限或边缘工作，吸收了新概念。 因而，一般你要去做那些短期痛苦但长期有收益的事情。\n\n建立新的心智模型最有效的方式是什么？ 大量阅读——就是读。 每天花一小时阅读科学、数学和哲学，很有可能在七年内让你登上人类成功的上层。 #心智模型 #重点复习 #《纳瓦尔宝典》", "timestamp": 1653393151, "digest": "Qaq4JzO1_Bnx-720ZyRrj2_hefp2bzjeChtO643mOxw", "contributor": "0xF7DB34e780FD944FD90dcF1FacC3eCB18e154469"}

{"id": "RWqRV32sq29kD3OgdxQg6vor3MbOUkL6b9D3O4JyiNM", "title": "Introducing — ASX Protocol", "body": "## Yield Strategies. Unified.\n\nGiven the fast-paced nature of DeFi, where new opportunities and choices arise every second, the main goal of many investors and participants is to focus their capital on assets that provide either utility or additional revenue streams.\n\nTo that end, staked assets play a very important role in enabling these additional use cases. However, in today's market, yield strategies are segmented between many players on several chains. Searching for the right chain and the right protocol to park your assets is time-consuming and costly.\n\nCurrently, if a user has interest-bearing assets on Chain A but finds a better opportunity on Chain B, he has to withdraw the assets from Protocol A (fee), send them to Chain B via a bridge (fee), and deposit them in Protocol B (fee). If he then finds a more interesting opportunity on Chain C, this whole process has to be repeated.\n\nFor tech-savvy large users (whales), this may not seem like a big deal, but for the average user, those fees alone can eat all their profits.\n\nOne of the base pillars of DeFi is time and money optimization and, as avid developers and users of it, we were always looking for a one-stop solution protocol, one that would take care of all the hard lifting and fees... one that was designed for everyone.\n\nSince we couldn't find it, we decided to build our own.\n\n## Enter ASX\n\nASX Protocol functions as a top layer DeFi network for staked assets, combining ASX's strategies with the most profitable ones available in the market.\n\nAssets deposited into an ASX Vault enter an automatic process of yield maximization through capital shifting, auto-compounding, rebalancing, and routing across multiple protocols and chains, making ASX a more capital-efficient alternative.\n\n### How does it work?\n\nASX smart contracts operate on three main spectrums:\n\n* ASX's own strategies\n* Third-party protocols' strategies\n* Combined strategies on each chain\n\nFor routing the staked assets across protocols of the same chain, ASX Vaults monitor the available protocols' performance using on-chain data and use that information to calculate the routing's viability and the best capital allocation.\n\nThe protocol then uses relayers, working in tandem with an oracle, to receive information between the available chains and sends the relevant data to each Vault. The Vault then determines the best asset allocation for each chain and protocol and executes.\n\nA lot is going on under the hood. We'll share more details on the mechanics once our smart contracts are open-sourced.\n\n### Chains and Protocols\n\nOur operations on yield routing are broken down into 3 phases:\n\nFor the first iterations of ASX (1st phase), the following chains and protocols will be available:\n\n* Ethereum → ASX, Convex, Yearn\n* Fantom → ASX, Yearn, Tarot\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HAJhRzkBfBUBbQN-IUwt1.png?height=1909&width=3000)\n\nDuring the 2nd phase, we'll expand the network into two more EVM compatible blockchains: Avalanche and Polygon.\n\nOn the 3rd phase will break the EVM boundaries and expand ASX into Terra and Solana, using the LayerZero network, making ASX truly omnichain.\n\n> *While ASX smart contracts are getting ready for public release, the interface will allow direct access to the third-party protocols' vaults*.\n\n## The ASX Token\n\nASX has been conceived, built, and driven by a founding group of individuals with expertise in creating web3 solutions and a core belief in decentralization and privacy.\n\nASX is the result of many months of development and it's our legacy to the crypto community. Because of that, we decided to do things a little differently.\n\nWe'll explain all the details about our token launch in our next post.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nThe core vision for ASX is to be the ultimate permissionless omnichain liquidity hub for staked assets, expanding beyond the borders of EVM and Non-EVM.\n\nOur smart contracts are currently in private beta and have consistently shown better performance than the third-party protocols' strategies. We're finishing up the final touches and getting them ready to be open-sourced and peer-reviewed before the public release, within the coming weeks.\n\nThe omnichain yield future is inevitable. Stay tuned.\n\n\n---\n\n* Participate in the [ASX Genesis Event →](https://mint.asx.st/)\n* Access our [Interface →](https://asx.st/)\n* Follow us on [Twitter →](https://twitter.com/asxlabs)\n* Join us on [Telegram →](https://t.me/asxprotocol)\n\n\n---\n\n*ASX is an emergent and constantly evolving experiment in decentralized finance.

{"id": "k3sCLX-RKCvjceGoAxcjtauvrPg8i89SR1plE9IFn4o", "title": "Key learnings from DAOs", "body": "A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a group organized around a specific mission that coordinates through a shared set of rules enforced on a blockchain. DAOs themselves are just organizational structures that control shared economic resources and/or protocol rules, and each DAO can be different in how it operates. Some DAOs are private and others are open for anyone to join and contribute. For some DAOs, active contributors can get paid by the DAO for their work.\n\nDAOs have been one of my favorite spaces in crypto to spend time in. The ability for people all over the world to come together to build towards a shared mission is exciting, especially when that same group could never have been formed under a traditional company due to various arbitrary barriers (e.g. location, age, part-time, non-traditional education/work experience). For more info on the potential of DAOs, please see my [beginner’s guide to DAOs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o).\n\nThis post covers some of my key takeaways from working with DAOs. Most of my experience has been as a delegate for Gitcoin DAO but I’ve also participated in and observed many others. There’s no perfect DAO structure and each one has its own culture so what works for one DAO won’t necessarily work for another. The following reflects my personal experience and perspective and other people might have a different one. The entire space is also constantly iterating to find out what works and what doesn’t.\n\n***When initially starting a DAO:***\n\n* **Establish a clear mission**. This is critical to keep a diverse and ever-evolving community aligned over time and guide decision-making. If someone comes to the DAO with a funding proposal that is out of scope, it should be an easy no. If the DAO’s priorities aren’t clear, it will be much more challenging to keep the group focused on progressing toward the mission.\n* **Consider progressive decentralization**. While the intention of many DAOs is to fully decentralize operations and decision-making, dropping a community into a DAO structure without guidance or leadership will often result in a lack of effective coordination. The founding team almost always has the most context and will ideally set the course for the DAO to progressively empower the broader community over time.\n\n  For example, the newly formed [Optimism Collective](https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55) has a working constitution that defines the Optimism Foundation’s role as a steward early on and how the Foundation will help guide the collective with plans to increasingly decentralize its role over time.\n\n![Section of Optimism Collective working constitution](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tubwsMVqvQ46PorDRLU6p.png?height=546&width=1432)\n\n***Operations:***\n\n* **Smaller working groups are more efficient**. It should not be the case that all DAO members vote on every decision needed in the DAO. It’s impossible to try to keep up with everything and it’s not the best use of everyone’s time, especially as the DAO scales. For this reason, I like the delegate model as seen with DAOs like Gitcoin and ENS, which allow token holders to delegate their votes to a person or group that is able to dedicate the time needed to make informed decisions.\n\n  Similarly, delegates don’t need to be involved in all aspects of day-to-day DAO operations either. Delegates won’t be an expert in every topic from finance to technical development to economic design and might not care about reviewing highly specific details. It is more efficient to establish smaller specialized groups that can focus on a specific area.\n\n  For example, each quarter in Gitcoin DAO, [working groups](https://twitter.com/AnnikaSays/status/1524120164522131456) share what they accomplished in the past quarter and the budget they need for the next quarter to then be voted on by delegates. [ENS DAO](https://twitter.com/OrcaProtocol/status/1517568136173834255) has been working with [Orca](https://www.orcaprotocol.org/) which is a DAO implementation that specifically focuses on enabling small working groups called pods. Another example is [Aave V3](https://docs.aave.com/developers/getting-started/readme) which lets whitelisted addresses update parameters without having to go through a governance vote. However, governance will have the ability to revoke these whitelisted addresses or add new ones.\n\n![Gitcoin DAO workstreams requesting a budget (image credit: Annika Lewis)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WjL_4vJRQLGgr86iagkdv.jpeg?height=520&width=931)\n\n* **Explore ways to establish accountability**. It is important to account for how involved each delegate and working group contributor is. In Gitcoin DAO, one attempt to measure delegate engagement is with [Steward Health Cards](https://stewards.eth.limo/) which measure things like voting activity and forum participation. Gitcoin DAO is in the [process](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-steward-health-cards-2-0/10418/4?u=linda) of building Workstream Health Cards and has also started quantifying DAO contributions so that some of the workstream contributors can work their way into becoming top delegates through engagement and participation in the DAO. These metrics should be refined over time so that it’s not gameable and doesn’t encourage the wrong behavior such as voting just for the sake of voting regardless of knowledge or expertise.\n\n  Delegate metrics can be helpful for members who are deciding where to delegate their votes. Sometimes people might just delegate to someone they recognize but that might not actually be an active delegate. I’m also very open to the idea of delegate election cycles which can be a way for people to phase out of the DAO when it’s no longer something they want to work on and keeps delegates thinking about if the DAO is something they want to continue to commit their time to.\n\n![Gitcoin DAO Steward Health Cards](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ovmxB_PWrKtUKT52gmQQ-.png?height=1532&width=1862)\n\n* **Discuss compensation structures**. There should be an open discussion regarding compensation structures when a significant work commitment is required from members or delegates. Not everyone can afford to work part-time on a DAO for free so they should be compensated for their work. In a delegate model, I believe all major delegates should be compensated for the gas they spend on voting and submitting on-chain proposals, at a minimum. This gives every delegate an equal opportunity to participate. Ideally, the DAO would also work towards standardizing compensation so that the DAO is not drastically underpaying or overpaying.\n* **Set the DAO up for long-term sustainability**. Consider diversifying the DAO treasury whether it’s a public round or private movement of funds into more stable assets like USDC or DAI (example of Forefront’s public [treasury diversification](https://snapshot.org/#/ffdao.eth/proposal/QmTqgWB7w372zStj45QkqZu6HtXP2NpzDamsoDAq8u25zV) round). Crypto is a volatile space and, no different than a company, it’s important to make sure that the DAO can operate for the long run. Be stringent on what expenses are paid from the DAO especially if it’s a recurring expense and there is no clear replenishment of funds.\n\n***Culture:***\n\n* **Foster a culture of being comfortable saying no and having tough conversations**. Since there is no CEO who is the ultimate decision-maker and is able to quickly say no to things that don’t align with the company goals, DAO members and delegates are responsible for protecting the DAO’s resources (time, attention, treasury). When a DAO treasury is openly available for anyone to make funding proposals, it can quickly get out of control. When you are potentially working with a lot of friends and people you respect, it can be difficult to say no and have tough conversations when requesting resources for certain projects that aren’t in the best interest of the DAO. Help foster a culture early on where everyone knows decisions are being made in the best interest of the DAO and that a no is not personal.\n* **Establish structures so members can take breaks**. Crypto being 24/7 and a DAO having async communication from people all over the world, with no break or time off standards, can be exhausting and lead to burnout. Set up ways for members to let others know they are taking time off. For example, Forefront even has a [DAO-bbatical](https://ffdao.notion.site/Forefront-Compensation-3825ebe3f4744204936ebe081c03b288) (sabbatical) as part of their compensation so that after 3 years full-time with Forefront, contributors get a paid leave of up to 6 months for rest, travel, research and/or acquisition of new skills or training. \n  \n In a delegate model, it would be ideal if there was liquid voting so that delegates themselves could delegate votes to others if they are not active for a period of time (or if it’s just not their expertise and wouldn’t be the best use of their time). This is no different than having a colleague take over someone’s work at a company while they are on vacation.\n* **Experiment early on**. Experiment with different systems and processes to see what works well for the DAO and what doesn’t. Early on it’s okay to experiment as long as it’s communicated transparently. The larger the DAO gets, the more difficult it is to experiment, change or introduce processes. One area which might be interesting to explore is the governance legos from [Element voting vaults](https://twitter.com/element_fi/status/1492203186874114053) which enable use cases such as giving voting power to Github contributors or allowing members to vote who are staking or providing liquidity on their tokens.\n\nThanks to [Will Warren](https://twitter.com/willwarren), [Jordan Clifford](https://twitter.com/jcliff42), [Simona Pop](https://twitter.com/Sim_Pop), [Scott Moore](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore), [Derek Hsue](https://twitter.com/derek_hsue), and [Julia Rosenberg](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze) for reviewing this post.\n\n*Disclaimer: Scalar Capital is an investor in Gitcoin, Element, Optimism, Forefront, and Orca.

Imagine being able to get into the pool regardless of the assets you have at your hands, gas tokens, and so on. So to reiterate, it’s a liquidity provision shortcut.\n\nThe sweet thing about it is that Symbiosis Zap is essentially cross-chain, so compared to all other existing solutions you can add liquidity in any token.\n\nThe bottom line is: using Zap we can add liquidity to the DeFi protocol with literally any token. For example, we want to add USDC liquidity to the Ethereum/BNB pool, but we only have ETH on hand. In this case, we will swap ETH->on-chain swap->USDC->cross-chain swap->get LP USDC/BUSD and all done in one transaction.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SL4WroZ_gSzBNm1ki76wH.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\nGetting LP tokens with cross-chain zaps\n\nAlthough we’ve composed a detailed user guide on cross-chain zaps, let’s discuss its raison d’etre.\n\nAssume that you’re a big fun of what Boba Network does and you want to enjoy a delicious 27% APR (at the time of writing) on stables in Boba/BNB pool in the Symbiosis protocol. In that case, you will need to go through a quite lengthy process as you need:\n\n1. USDC Boba\n2. BUSD BEP20\n3. Gas tokens for both\n\nThe process is described here. But if you’re lazy enough like we are (which is great because it is the laziness that typically pushes innovation), then you better use Symbiosis Zaps.\n\nWith cross-chain zaps, instead you can choose a token on the source network and turn it into a LP token on the destination network. And that’s it!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Dr2ysSzKn5OWbIhzEYkqN.png?height=821&width=632)\n\n![Straight outta Symbiosis App 🚀](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b3GhH3md2evYiTJxX88YD.png?height=655&width=642)\n\nBuckle Up! Cross-Chain DeFi Liquidity is Coming\n\nFurther on, we’re planning to integrate several DeFi-native protocols so that Symbiosis can be used as a unified cross-chain communication layer.

本周余额1\\~10的地址量，继续大幅增长，创新高。而余额为10\\~100地址量周内震荡，100\\~1k地址量略增，＞1k地址量略减，表明大额地址增持不明显。随着币价绝对值提高，可能囤币党更倾向于分散小额存储。\n* 活跃地址情绪量表示活跃地址增速与价格增速的比值，目前已跌破下边界，并到达历次熊市大底附近区域。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lxop6E9Zg98wgGp0Bqbi1.png?height=1263&width=2000)\n\n### \\~一年以上持有量占比：65.5%继续新高\n\n* 上周本指标小幅震荡，本周又继续创新高，表明上周虽因暴跌导致部分长期持有者减持，但本周又重新开始继续增持。\n\n### \\~Liveliness活跃度指标：又进入HODL\n\n* 上周大幅反弹，表明长期持有者抛售。本周重新开始下跌，长期持有者又开始HODL。\n\n### \\~储备风险Reserve Risk：历史大底区间\n\n* 本指标与上周持平，无明显变化，目前价位依然属于历史级别的底部区间。\n\n### \\~长期持有者持币数：盘整区内小幅积累\n\n* 本处长期持有者指持有超过6个月。下图绿线为抛售区，红线为积累区，蓝线为盘整区。\n* 1月26日到达最高点，表明从21年5月开始的积累区基本结束，进入盘整期，在币价没有明显大涨之前，不会进入大周期抛售区。\n* 根据2019年经验，在盘整区内会因币价反弹和回调，而出现小区间的抛售和积累，目前属于小区间的积累末端。后续如果大幅反弹会有短期抄底减持；若继续大跌会继续有恐慌盘退出，而再次出现小区间抛售。本指标短期没有太强的指向性。\n\n![图片来源：Lianshucha](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HLYlbAFS5Q5PaeJzexsCj.png?height=1272&width=1928)\n\n### \\~持有年龄分布：1\\~6月减持，其他增持\n\n* 分析持有年龄分布，在5月12日前后的大跌过程中，1\\~6月减持为主，小于1个月的增持为主，6\\~12个月小幅增持，1年以上微量增持。\n* 表明1\\~6月短线投机者无法承受下跌风险，卖出为主；卖出的币主要被新增地址抄底买入，这些新开地址，应该多数也是长线投资群体。\n\n### 1.1.2、BTC中长期指标\n\n### \\~BTC

\\~2-Year乘数通道：大幅跌破2年线\n\n* 本指标与上周相比无变化，不再赘述。\n\n### \\~市场健康程度：历史大底\n\n* 本周该指标依然在低位，与2015年和2018年大熊市底部的数值相当。\n\n### \\~交易所余额及占比：小户卖大户接\n\n* 本周币价无太大变化，交易所余额维持短暂的平衡。\n* 根据CryptoQuant数据，按照7日平均统计，流入52329笔，平均每笔1枚；流出6800笔，平均每笔6枚。可见小户的抛售被大户承接了。\n\n### \\~挖矿成本：28743美元\n\n* 根据财经M平方数据，目前挖矿成本为28743美元，接近现价。\n\n### \\~矿工地址：没有大量抛售，反而在增持\n\n*

本周交易所流入流出维持平衡，但流入卖出以小额为主，流出买入以大额为主。\n* 相关估值指标与上周相同，目前依然是底部区间。\n* 近期Bitfinex的多头头寸大幅增加60%，而其上次大幅增加是21年5\\~7月份。FTX合约持仓量也大增，以费率判断以多头头寸为主。这两个交易所都是机构常用平台。\n* BTC与标普SPX和纳指NDQ保持周同步，但周内有日级别的背离不同步，期待走出独立行情。\n\n![图片来源：tradingview](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uA-V1teQcNUtEXDU6TNgJ.png?height=768&width=1813)\n\n## 1.4、全市场分析\n\n###

These headlines have been the caviar of the breaking news, Twitter, LinkedIn, and even Instagram. I haven’t heard anyone from my IRL/online network not speaking, or complaining, about this drop in the last weeks.\n\nThe current state of the global economy and the endless crypto news have motivated me to finalize the draft of this article and share my thoughts on the emerging segment within FinTech that I call “ Asset Management as a Service”.\n\n### Definition & Introduction\n\nI discovered this new segment a few months ago while I was mingling across Discord groups to get deals data. Jumping in a brief chat with a user, who seems someone financially literate, led me to the bottomless crypto-asset diversification debate and my first introduction to “Asset Management as a Service”. I could define it as the way to manage and invest clients/LPs’ funds without the need to have ownership and total access and/or control over the financial assets. On the opposite of the traditional approach, where Clients/LPs give up ownership and full control of their funds over a fixed time. It leverages multiple technologies like APIs, AI/ML, and blockchain to disrupt the legacy Asset Management space.\n\nAfter a quick research, the recent data and metrics related to Asset Management blew my mind: this juicy industry [sized $103 trillion in 2021](https://web-assets.bcg.com/79/bf/d1d361854084a9624a0cbce3bf07/bcg-global-asset-management-2021-jul-2021.pdf), and retail portfolios represented 41% of global assets, or $42 trillion according to BCG. The global crypto trend & pandemic have largely contributed to the spike in interest of retail investors for investment products. The US equity trading activity [has doubled since the beginning of the pandemic](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-new-way-to-look-at-retail-trading-trends), rising from around $18 billion/day (pre-2020) to around $32 billion/day in March 2020. And the number of crypto owners is expected to grow from [295 million to 1 billion](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hfgyig42jimx/5i8TeN1QYJDjn82pSuZB5S/85c7c9393f3ee67e456ec780f9bf11e3/Cryptodotcom_Crypto_Market_Sizing_Jan2022.pdf) by the end of 2022. The metrics from some companies operating in this space raised my attention to further dive in, like Kryll.io which managed to reach [+$3.5 billion traded volumes in April 2022](https://blog.kryll.io/kryll-changelog-monthly-progress-report-april-2022-metrics/) and operate/use across 112 countries. Or Zignaly, the profit-sharing/copy-trading platform gathers +55K users and manages +$60M AUM through API-linked crypto trading accounts up to date.\n\n### The Market Drivers\n\nAlthough the industry has seen some innovation over the past decade, it still remains fundamentally conservative given the nature of the business. In my opinion, the structural changes and new technologies applied to finance will be key drivers of AMaaS :\n\n·        First and foremost, the global population is getting more educated about the Financial Market and the basics of Personal Finance. The multiplication of trading apps and neo-banks offering stock/crypto investing products depict this new generation's willingness to keep full control and ownership over their financial assets. According to [The Motley Fool survey 2021](https://www.fool.com/research/what-are-gen-z-millennial-investors-buying/), 73% of Gen Z investors and 66% of millennial investors own stocks, and unsurprisingly, 40% of stock investors aged 18 to 40 own cryptocurrencies. It demonstrates a growing interest in the financial industry, Charles Swab talks now about the [“Generation I(nvestor)”.](https://www.aboutschwab.com/generation-investor-study-2021)\n\n·        The decentralization of Investment Management knowledge outside of the banking/hedge fund industry and the growing individual/independent investor community across social networks largely participate in the change of the Asset Management landscape. The episode of [Reddit’s traders vs HFs](https://www.ft.com/content/7a91e3ea-b9ec-4611-9a03-a8dd3b8bddb5), or the [anonymous Twitter user explaining step by step how to break Terra](https://twitter.com/FreddieRaynolds/status/1463960623402913797) in Nov. 2021,  illustrates the capacity of some retail investors to research/act like \"professional\" investors. The community aspect and knowledge sharing play a crucial role in the Future of Asset Management: favoriting the \"multiplayer\" and \"community-belonging\" sentiment lead to higher engagement. A16Z addresses better the community-first social investing topic in the \"[Big ideas that fintech will tackle in 2022](https://a16z.com/2021/12/20/the-big-ideas-that-fintech-will-tackle-in-2022/#:\\~:text=In%202022%2C%20we'll%20see,fiat%20and%20crypto%20financial%20lives)” post. Additionally, the myriad of FinMeme/StockMeme accounts genuinely outline the exponential factor of Community in the global financial industry.\n\n·        Aforementioned above, trading platforms blossoming over the past years have upside down the traditional investing/trading market by granting commission-free, low-capital access, and fractional shares trading. The financial market consumerization and the democratization of retail investing activities play a subsequent stake in the emergence of AMaaS, as well as, participate in the popularization of new investment instruments, like NFTs or cryptocurrencies. Technical innovations applied to Financial Services – like APIs, Blockchain, Bots, or AI/ML – are the main drivers of this new market. Quantitative/algorithmic investment strategies are getting more traction within the stock market in the past years (e.g. Two Sigma, Renaissance Technologies…), and automation has become a norm in the Finance industry. APIs can allow anyone to manage your brokerage/trading account with specific restrictions. Blockchain – especially smart contracts – acts as a safeguard/trusted-third party. Bots automize investment strategies while minimizing cognitive biases. Venture investments have started to hit the space, and startups have begun to stand out, such as the US-company Alpaca building a developer-first API for stock/crypto trading that secured [+$70M from VC firms](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/alpaca-raises-50m-to-rapidly-scale-its-equities-trading-api-business/), or Zignaly developing a profit-sharing based copy-trading platform for digital assets raised +$50M.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads me to think of a future where people would easily access  \"plug and play\" alpha-generating services within a few clicks. And anyone would be able to start \"independent\" Asset Management activities with enterprise-grade tools/ infrastructures.\n\n### Applications\n\nFrom my investigation, the AMaaS landscape is growing over the days and attracting more retail and institutional investors. Applications within this space include: marketplaces matching Asset Managers & customers, investment strategy creation/rental/sell/purchase platform, NFT-based asset management, DAO, wallet-2-wallet following, API-based trading infrastructure/web3 infrastructure, and enterprise-grade tools for retail investors/independent Asset Managers. Find below some interesting companies that I have spotted operating in this space.\n\n![Segment mapping](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sw5IVoRmZPCOy1NsK6oZV.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this blog post! if you have any questions and comments, or just want to chat, please feel free to [reach out to me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-chen-t-h-3b40ba122/).

{"id": "bTifWWc0a5amR3wqorsNOFF_fOv2ShwsNrLaCurOSnM", "title": "STEPN’s Story of Success", "body": "Here at STEPN, we’ve been extremely grateful for all the excitement, support, and engagement we have seen from the community.\n\nIt’s been a whirlwind of emotions seeing our dream grow into a reality.\n\nWe’ve truly put our blood, sweat, and tears into this platform for the past several months, working long nights to create something that will help make the world a healthier place.\n\nWe’re continuing to work hard to reach more people and encourage them to build healthy habits, and spending more time with their loved ones outside.\n\nWe recently got invited to CryptoBahamas — a leading industry event where some of the industry stalwarts (like Sam Bankman Fried) to thought leaders (eg Bill Clinton, Tony Blair) to the biggest names from all walks of life (Tom Brady, Katy Perry, Gisele Bundchen) took the stage. It is on this magnificent stage that STEPN got to share its story — the story of love and respect that it gets from its users and the industry alike! We got asked about it a lot so thought of sharing it with you all.\n\nThis is how our story goes…\n\nParabolic growth\nWe’re blessed to say that our growth has been quite astronomical. In under six months of launching our public beta last year, STEPN has blossomed into a vibrant community of over 2.3 mn monthly active users and attracted over half a million daily active users’’. On March 30th, our governance token (GMT) exceeded trading volumes of even Bitcoin and Ethereum — phenomenal statistics, even in the web3 space.\n\nHow did this happen?\nIt certainly wasn’t luck or overnight success. Like any web3 project, there is definitely a level of hype that has been a part of our growth. But underpinning that is a strong foundation that we have paid the utmost attention to, from game design to tokenomics, utility to business strategy.\n\nToday, we will be outlining some core factors that have helped STEPN succeed — and which we strongly believe will help us make a huge impact on the health of millions of people around the world.\n\n1. We are the first crypto app with mass, diverse appeal\n   STEPN appeals to a massive audience.\n\n“I have never seen a crypto application generate this much outside interest,” said Nat Eliason, an online writer and web3 consultant. People across the world who have never dabbled in crypto before are now adopting STEPN, making it their first-ever entry into the space. A hundred thousand people are using the app every minute — running alongside not in Metaverse but in reality!\n\nWhy? Because the value proposition is simple — move outside for a certain amount of time and you will get rewarded in crypto. Yes, there’s some barriers to knowledge and some barriers to setting up, but the incentives to overcome these barriers are getting easier to overcome, especially as friends help other friends set up their sneakers.\n\nMost importantly, users don’t need to understand the economics or engineering behind the scenes in order to participate. Many web3 projects require a vast amount of stops and starts, as well as an understanding of confusing jargon in order to get started. For STEPN, the premise is almost as simple as it can be. Move outside and earn crypto.\n\nAnd in the future, with the implementation of a rental system, the onboarding process will be made even smoother.\n\nAs a result, we are truly optimistic about fulfilling our mission — onboarding the most diverse set of consumers that web3 has ever seen.\n\n1. We are here to revolutionize health and fitness\n   The fitness and wellness industry is worth well over 4 trillion dollars. Yet the state of our collective health has never been worse.\n\nObesity costs the US alone nearly $210 billion every year, while 1.4 billion people across the world don’t get enough exercise, according to the WHO.\nMeanwhile, 61% of people aged 18 to 25 say they report high levels of loneliness — which is closely tied to higher risks of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.\nSince March 2020, rates of depression and anxiety skyrocketed over 300% while suicidal ideation doubled.\nIt’s clear that something needs to change, but lack of technology or resources doesn’t seem to be the issue. We have an abundance of fancy wearables, $1,000 Pelotons, and boutique cycling classes. Last year, investments in digital mental health therapy reached record highs, with three of the highest-funded quarters ever.\n\nThe issue, instead, seems to be that we’re overcomplicating things… perhaps it’s time to take it back to basics. Walking and running are some of the simplest and most accessible forms of exercise that we have.\n\nSTEPN is pioneering the move-to-earn movement, incentivizing exercise and paying people to workout — giving people everywhere an instant, clear incentive to get healthy.\n\nThus, not only is STEPN rewarding users financially, but it’s also providing an array of intangible rewards: people are losing weight and developing consistent exercise routines for the first time in their lives, they’re spending more time with their friends and family outdoors, and they’re getting happier and healthier with every step they take.\n\n1. We stand on the shoulders of giants\n   We are well aware of the delicate nature of designing a robust, thriving economy. As STEPN explodes in popularity, we’re quickly becoming a virtual country ourselves. That comes with all the complexities of designing a monetary policy for a country in real life.\n\nThat’s why we look to examples of who have come before us — even real-world historical examples, such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis — and carefully study ways to avoid economic meltdowns. In the play-to-earn space, this sort of hyperinflation, which leads to a “doom cycle” of asset devaluation, has already occurred several times.\n\nThe most prominent example is Axie Infinity, which saw the price of SLP, its in-game currency, plunge over 90% in the past several months.\n\nAxie has pioneered the play-to-earn space and paved the way for all other x-to-earn startups. Unfortunately, it’s facing inflation challenges now, driven by the fact that more players are cashing out their SLP rather than reinvesting them. With insufficient demand, the token is expectedly depreciating, which drives even more players to cash out into more lucrative stores of value. As a result, mass capital flight ensues.\n\nSo how are we setting ourselves apart?\nFor one, we’ve been diligent in designing the game to be inherently fun and positively addicting. And we encourage users who are there to, not just earn tokens and NFT rewards, but strengthen their relationships within their communities (walking together and leveling up sneakers together).\n\nThis presents a hedge against those who are only walking to earn as much as they can and then cash out their earnings (which drives inflation). In other words, we’re ensuring a vast majority of the STEPN community aren’t just here for cash — they are here for all the other intangibles — better health, better relationships, and better mood.\n\nSecondly, we have plans to roll out features beyond just breeding, repairing, or upgrading sneakers that will address the delicacy of move-to-earn tokenomics. The GMT token, for example, will also be used as a way for users to vote on donating to carbon offsetting programs and we plan to integrate social-fi elements that go beyond move-to-earn, adding more value to GMT and building in more robust use cases for the token. And we’ve also built in key incentives, known as “game sinks,” for users to retain their assets and continue to reinvest in the game.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nWhat we’ve laid out above are just a few of the things that have contributed to our success as we build STEPN and plan for the platform’s future.\n\nAs the metaverse gets more and more integrated into our lives, we also plan on blooming into a social platform, which involves bolstering our product as a signaling-as-a-service mechanism, combining the positive power of social signaling with fitness achievements. And we’re continuing to leverage key partnerships in the fitness space, such as our recent release with premier activewear brand ASICS.\n\nMost importantly, we are committed to being a responsible company that adds more good into the world. We’re dedicated to promoting diversity in web3 and helping to build a greener web3.\n\nWe do this for the planet, for the health of our friends and families, and to reach millions of people across the world, to help them lead a better, healthier, and happier life.\n\n[https://app.cyberconnect.me/address/0xFB96AC504830d01dFC511672407a50BfBC9D4577](https://app.cyberconnect.me/address/0xFB96AC504830d01dFC511672407a50BfBC9D4577)\n\n", "timestamp": 1653390485, "digest": "er-ZYLsL3xLzUo_Hp0GweIGORf5Zs0Tg7VsSZcFKNU4", "contributor": "0xFB96AC504830d01dFC511672407a50BfBC9D4577"}

{"id": "J-gjCTNJGvkowMbl3xhN0wm4IjYaAPOxWQrSxoDpzhQ", "title": "美联储9月份结束加息？年内市场有机会重启牛市吗？", "body": "1 橙子聊热点\n\n先说美联储加息的消息，前几天还说鸽派已经全军覆没了，结果昨晚亚特兰大联储主席Raphael Bostic就放出了9月份可能会暂停加息的虎狼言论，虽然他也认为接下来的两次会议都会加息50个基点，但是他也认为经过一些列操作后，通胀肯定会走低，再加上6月1号开始的缩表，所以这波加息9月可能就会结束，能看出来美联储内部又出现了多种言论了，目前最鹰的仍然是圣路易斯联储主席布拉德，他的观点是今年接下来的所有议息会议都会加息50个基点，除了这俩老哥对立外，还有一些人预测美联储将会在7月后放缓加息脚步，所以后面的紧缩政策又变得扑朔迷离了，我还是坚持之前的观点，年底之前美联储会由加息政策转变为降息政策，而全球金融市场也会在年内出现反转行情，这是我的预测，有不同意见的可以给我留言。\n\n昨天有94家机构共在美联储存入2.045万亿美元的资金，这是史上最大的隔夜逆回购，之前的历史纪录是上周五创下的1.988万亿美元。能看出来目前大机构的投资欲望已经降到了冰点，几乎没有其他有吸引力的选项可以用于存储多余的现金，因此他们认为美联储逆回购是一个避风港。其实这种算是市场行为了，资金向美联储回流对金融市场肯定是一种打击，不过这也有利于通胀问题的解决，这也是我对年内结束紧缩持乐观态度的原因。\n\n近几周美股市场也是跌的挺惨的，大部分的散户基本都离场了，不过昨晚有个数据还挺有意思的，据统计2022年5月，有超过1100名上市公司高管购入了自家公司的股票，公司高管买卖股票的比例从4月份的0.43上升至1.04，并且有望刷新2020年3月以来的纪录。这里面大部分都是大型企业的高管，例如星巴克、英特尔等，高管们对自己公司的业务有足够的信心，并且投入了更多的资金，这种态度会使得人们认为股市未来的情况或许不会像他们所担心的那么糟糕，长期来看这也是一个积极的信号。\n\n据彭博社报道，澳大利亚新当选的总理 Anthony Albanese 将加密货币监管列为三个优先事项之一，另两个为气候问题和通货膨胀飙升。把加密监管放到如此重要的地位，能看出在澳大利亚加密应该已经有很大影响力了，目前来看发达国家基本上都是以监管为主的，只有中国​及中国的小弟们采取一刀切政策。\n\n再看几个数据，当前比特币和加密货币市场上的悲观程度已达到 2020 年3月12日以来的最高水平，目前比特币的MVRV数据已经连续两周维持在1.2附近了，从历史数据来看，目前的价格继续下行的风险已经相对可控了。\n\nTwitter搜索：@BitorangeRating （或比特币橙子Trader）\n\nTelegram电报搜索：橙子的朋友们\n\nTelegram禁言群搜索：橙子的禁言群\n\n2 橙子读行情\n\nBTC:  比特币直接拉跨，不跟美股上涨，反而跌了哈，当前也没什么好分析的，等6月份吧，6月份开始估计会有像样的反弹走势。4小时级别，还是没有走出震荡区间，当前走势一直在震荡区间徘徊，震荡区间范围31300-28000附近。\n\nETH:  以太坊昨晚跌破2000点之后目前还没有像样的反弹，能看出市场多军情绪已经被消磨殆尽了，短期仍然不建议做任何买入操作，长期的话以太坊不用担心，它仍是最具投资价值的加密资产之一。\n\nAVAX：雪崩这几天走势比大盘偏弱，这个应该和创始人gun教授说他们在luna事件中亏损接近6000万美元有关，而且现在lfg还没有公布剩余的avax要怎么处理呢，这始终是不确定的，所以短期也不建议碰雪崩，长期仓位留着没问题，​毕竟雪崩已经获得足够的共识级别，基本面仍然是前五甚至前三的公链。\n\nGMT：stepn今天搞了个新活动，大概就是让你联合几个大户开个私服，然后挖xgst，还可以定制nft，只要有流量就可以搞，然后你赚钱stepn获得流量，说白了就是一种裂变模式，虽然说这个方法挺好，不过推行新模式说明团队已经有危机感了，因为GMT本身就是一种模式币，所以大家一定要注意风险，一旦GMT矿工收入下降那么就要小心了，​所以这项目适合撸短，但是不建议长持。\n\nICP：ICP跟着大盘走，短期还没有走行情的趋势，不过长期ICP依然值得关注，因为ICP是目前少数的还没有讲数据故事的大公链项目，而他无论是资源、共识、性能都不比sol和avax差，目前制约它的就是解锁模式，不过只要后续有​生态的赋能，长期来看ICP还是有潜力的。\n​\n\nFLOW：FLOW在cb上的交易量太小，说明这次上市并没有把美国散户带进来，这应该和币圈美股连续几周的下跌，美国韭菜失去信心有关，所以短期应该很难走独立行情了，不过长期因为FLOW有非常强大的资源和圈外用户，这个能保证FLOW在熊市依然有存在的价值，​所以还是很适合长持的。​\n\n关注Twitter：@BitorangeRating\n\n加入电报：<https://t.me/zicheng_95330> （搜索：橙子的朋友们）\n\nTelegram禁言群搜索：橙子的禁言群\n\n【免责声明】 以上内容不构成任何投资建议，根据银保监会等五部门于2018年8月发布的《关于防范以\\[虚拟货币\\]\\[区块链\\]名义进行非法集资的风险提示》相关文件，请理性看待区块链，不要盲目听信他人，数字资产市场波动极大，风险极高，入市需高度谨慎。\n\n【风险提醒】 数字资产波动较大，风险极高，请谨慎参与，杜绝满仓梭哈，拒绝贷款杠杆；\n\n原创不易，欢迎转发，点个“在看”你懂得！", "timestamp": 1653394491, "digest": "cpXrv0ps716qnAZGbXvP6S1LO_t-v1wFX5iCHcNxbfY", "contributor": "0xEB4e8Ef6424Da3f89562c4e5fA4769420eC8DcE4"}

These headlines have been the caviar of the breaking news, Twitter, LinkedIn, and even Instagram. I haven’t heard anyone from my IRL/online network not speaking, or complaining, about this drop in the last weeks.\n\nThe current state of the global economy and the endless crypto news have motivated me to finalize the draft of this article and share my thoughts on the emerging segment within FinTech that I call “ Asset Management as a Service”.\n\n### Definition & Introduction\n\nI discovered this new segment a few months ago while I was mingling across Discord groups to get deals data. Jumping in a brief chat with a user, who seems someone financially literate, led me to the bottomless crypto-asset diversification debate and my first introduction to “Asset Management as a Service”. I could define it as the way to manage and invest clients/LPs’ funds without the need to have ownership and total access and/or control over the financial assets. On the opposite of the traditional approach, where Clients/LPs give up ownership and full control of their funds over a fixed time. It leverages multiple technologies like APIs, AI/ML, and blockchain to disrupt the legacy Asset Management space.\n\nAfter a quick research, the recent data and metrics related to Asset Management blew my mind: this juicy industry [sized $103 trillion in 2021](https://web-assets.bcg.com/79/bf/d1d361854084a9624a0cbce3bf07/bcg-global-asset-management-2021-jul-2021.pdf), and retail portfolios represented 41% of global assets, or $42 trillion according to BCG. The global crypto trend & pandemic have largely contributed to the spike in interest of retail investors for investment products. The US equity trading activity [has doubled since the beginning of the pandemic](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-new-way-to-look-at-retail-trading-trends), rising from around $18 billion/day (pre-2020) to around $32 billion/day in March 2020. And the number of crypto owners is expected to grow from [295 million to 1 billion](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hfgyig42jimx/5i8TeN1QYJDjn82pSuZB5S/85c7c9393f3ee67e456ec780f9bf11e3/Cryptodotcom_Crypto_Market_Sizing_Jan2022.pdf) by the end of 2022. The metrics from some companies operating in this space raised my attention to further dive in, like Kryll.io which managed to reach [+$3.5 billion traded volumes in April 2022](https://blog.kryll.io/kryll-changelog-monthly-progress-report-april-2022-metrics/) and operate/use across 112 countries. Or Zignaly, the profit-sharing/copy-trading platform gathers +55K users and manages +$60M AUM through API-linked crypto trading accounts up to date.\n\n### The Market Drivers\n\nAlthough the industry has seen some innovation over the past decade, it still remains fundamentally conservative given the nature of the business. In my opinion, the structural changes and new technologies applied to finance will be key drivers of AMaaS :\n\n·        First and foremost, the global population is getting more educated about the Financial Market and the basics of Personal Finance. The multiplication of trading apps and neo-banks offering stock/crypto investing products depict this new generation's willingness to keep full control and ownership over their financial assets. According to [The Motley Fool survey 2021](https://www.fool.com/research/what-are-gen-z-millennial-investors-buying/), 73% of Gen Z investors and 66% of millennial investors own stocks, and unsurprisingly, 40% of stock investors aged 18 to 40 own cryptocurrencies. It demonstrates a growing interest in the financial industry, Charles Swab talks now about the [“Generation I(nvestor)”.](https://www.aboutschwab.com/generation-investor-study-2021)\n\n·        The decentralization of Investment Management knowledge outside of the banking/hedge fund industry and the growing individual/independent investor community across social networks largely participate in the change of the Asset Management landscape. The episode of [Reddit’s traders vs HFs](https://www.ft.com/content/7a91e3ea-b9ec-4611-9a03-a8dd3b8bddb5), or the [anonymous Twitter user explaining step by step how to break Terra](https://twitter.com/FreddieRaynolds/status/1463960623402913797) in Nov. 2021,  illustrates the capacity of some retail investors to research/act like \"professional\" investors. The community aspect and knowledge sharing play a crucial role in the Future of Asset Management: favoriting the \"multiplayer\" and \"community-belonging\" sentiment lead to higher engagement. A16Z addresses better the community-first social investing topic in the \"[Big ideas that fintech will tackle in 2022](https://a16z.com/2021/12/20/the-big-ideas-that-fintech-will-tackle-in-2022/#:\\~:text=In%202022%2C%20we'll%20see,fiat%20and%20crypto%20financial%20lives)” post. Additionally, the myriad of FinMeme/StockMeme accounts genuinely outline the exponential factor of Community in the global financial industry.\n\n·        Aforementioned above, trading platforms blossoming over the past years have upside down the traditional investing/trading market by granting commission-free, low-capital access, and fractional shares trading. The financial market consumerization and the democratization of retail investing activities play a subsequent stake in the emergence of AMaaS, as well as, participate in the popularization of new investment instruments, like NFTs or cryptocurrencies. Technical innovations applied to Financial Services – like APIs, Blockchain, Bots, or AI/ML – are the main drivers of this new market. Quantitative/algorithmic investment strategies are getting more traction within the stock market in the past years (e.g. Two Sigma, Renaissance Technologies…), and automation has become a norm in the Finance industry. APIs can allow anyone to manage your brokerage/trading account with specific restrictions. Blockchain – especially smart contracts – acts as a safeguard/trusted-third party. Bots automize investment strategies while minimizing cognitive biases. Venture investments have started to hit the space, and startups have begun to stand out, such as the US-company Alpaca building a developer-first API for stock/crypto trading that secured [+$70M from VC firms](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/alpaca-raises-50m-to-rapidly-scale-its-equities-trading-api-business/), or Zignaly developing a profit-sharing based copy-trading platform for digital assets raised +$50M.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads me to think of a future where people would easily access  \"plug and play\" alpha-generating services within a few clicks. And anyone would be able to start \"independent\" Asset Management activities with enterprise-grade tools/ infrastructures.\n\n### Applications\n\nFrom my investigation, the AMaaS landscape is growing over the days and attracting more retail and institutional investors. Applications within this space include: marketplaces matching Asset Managers & customers, investment strategy creation/rental/sell/purchase platform, NFT-based asset management, DAO, wallet-2-wallet following, API-based trading infrastructure/web3 infrastructure, and enterprise-grade tools for retail investors/independent Asset Managers. Find below some interesting companies that I have spotted operating in this space.\n\n![Segment mapping](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sw5IVoRmZPCOy1NsK6oZV.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this blog post! if you have any questions and comments, or just want to chat, please feel free to [reach out to me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-chen-t-h-3b40ba122/).

gates）**：这些是我们要品尝的香料。不同的配置（口味）将得到不同的Kimchi。更正式点说，根据我们想要证明的计算类型，我们将选择不同的自定义门来创建电路。\n* **排列（Permutation）**：就像白菜一样，这是将泡菜的味道融合在一起的部分，它使泡菜成为一道菜，而不仅仅是一些不相交的简单成分。更正式点说，排列论证执行门之间的*连线*（即从输入和到输出的连接），表示执行迹（execution trace）中单元之间的复制约束（copy constraints）。\n* **查找表（Lookup tables）**：再加点盐虽非必要，但会使结果脱颖而出。出于效率原因，我们可以使用查找表。一些公共信息（例如布尔函数）可以由双方（证明者和验证者）存储，而不是硬连线在电路中。\n\n所有这些论证系统都被翻译成等式，这些等式必须对整个关系的正确证据（witness）成立。等价地，就是说这些表达式需要在一组特定数上求值为零。在烹饪泡菜之前，我们应该确保我们知道所涉及的流程。所以这里有两个问题需要解决：\n\n1. **根检验 （Roots-check）**：确保各组分通过一些质量测试，正式说即查验方程在一组数上的求值为零。\n2. **聚合（Aggregate）**：检验**所有**成分，即每个方程都必须满足上述条件。\n\n下面，我们将使用符号FF指代一个*有限域*。你可以将其理解为其中元素像钟表🕙一样运行的数学结构，意思是域中的最大元素会回绕到最小元素（类比12点和0点指向一个位置）这些域的一个我们关心的良好属性是这些域中的数字不能无限增长，它们总是会保持在一个范围内（称为域的*阶*）。而且，代数仍然成立（我们称之为*模代数*）。有一个小点要注意一下，有限域的阶必须是素数或素数的幂。所以让我们带上你的 13 小时计时器，开始制作泡菜吧！\n\n### \n\n \n 对第一个问题，给定一个阶为dd的多项式，要求对一个集合SS（一系列数）中的所有元素xx检验p(x)=0p(x)=0 。当然，你可以手动对集合中的所有元素求值，然后确保上述论断的正确。 但是那会花费太长时间（即不简洁）。反之，我们想要一次检验所有的方程。 一个很好的方法是通过使用**归零多项式**（vanishing polynomial）。这种多项式vS(X)vS(X) 不过是在SS上求值为0的最小多项式，意即刚好由下列单项式乘积构成的阶为|S||S| 的多项式： \n vS(X)=∏s∈S(X−s)vS(X)=∏s∈S(X−s)\n\n为什么这个有用呢？ 首先我们需要做一个关键的观察。因为归零多项式在每一个x∈Sx∈S上都等于0，且为满足该性质的最低阶多项式，如果我们的起始多项式p(X)p(X) 在SS上求值为0，那么p(X)p(X) 一定是归零多项式vS(X)vS(X)的*倍数*。但这在实践中意味着什么？ 通过多项式除法，这意味着存在一个次数为 d−|S|d−|S| 的**商多项式**，使得： \n q(X):=p(X)vS(X)q(X):=p(X)vS(X)\n\n如果你能提供这样一个商多项式，你可以很容易地对一个随机数a∈F∖Sa∈F∖S（不能在集合中，否则会得到0/00/0）检查 q(a)=p(a)/vS(a)q(a)=p(a)/vS(a) 是否成立，如果是那么以很高概率意味着实际上 p(X)=q(X)⋅vS(X)p(X)=q(X)⋅vS(X)，即p(X)p(X) 在整个集合SS 上求值为0，注意这里我们只检查了一点！\n\n让我们更深入地了解这里发生的“魔法”。 首先，我们所说的“以很高概率”是什么意思呢？ 这足够好吗？ 这个问题的答案是：与你想要的一样好。\n\n1. 首先我们来分析这个检验的数学。如果p(X)=q(X)⋅vS(X)p(X)=q(X)⋅vS(X) 确实成立，那么对于任意可能的 a∈F∖Sa∈F∖S ，检验p(a)?=q(a)⋅vS(a)p(a)=?q(a)⋅vS(a) 一定成立。但是否有任何不幸的点实例使得p(a)=q(a)⋅vS(a)p(a)=q(a)⋅vS(a) ，但是p(X)≠q(X)⋅vS(X)p(X)≠q(X)⋅vS(X) 呢？答案是，有这样的点，但，没有很多。但到底有多少呢？有多不可能呢？你已经知道这个的答案了：**Schwartz-Zippel**。回顾该引理：\n\n> 给定两个dd阶不同的多项式f(X)f(X) 和g(X)g(X) ，他们至多相交于（*一致*于）dd个点。或者等价地，另 h(X):=f(X)−g(X)h(X):=f(X)−g(X)，多项式h(X)h(X)可以至多在dd个点求值为0（其根）。\n\n因此，如果我们令 p(X)→f(X)p(X)→f(X) ，q(X)⋅vS(X)→g(X)q(X)⋅vS(X)→g(X) ，阶都为 dd，则有至多 d|F−S|d|F−S| 个不幸的点 aa 可以诱使你认为 p(X)p(X) 是归零多项式的倍数（因此在所有 SS 上的点都等于0）。那么，如何才能使这个错误概率可忽略呢？ 通过足够大的域大小（形式化定义是其大小的倒数应该比任何多项式表达式减小得更快）。 由于我们正在使用大小为 22552255 的域，因此我们是安全的！\n\n2. 其次，这真的比检查对所有 x∈Sx∈S 是否 p(x)=0p(x)=0 更快吗？ 归根结底，我们似乎需要求值 vS(a)vS(a)，并且由于这是一个 |S||S|阶多项式，看起来我们仍在执行大约相同数量级的计算。 数学在这里又来救场了。 在实践中，我们希望将这个集合 SS 定义为具有良好的结构，使我们能够比使用任意数的集合更有效地执行一些计算。 实际上，这个集合通常是一个**乘法群**（通常表示为 GG 或 HH ），因为在这样的群中，归零多项式 vG(X):=∏ω∈G(X−ω)vG(X):=∏ω∈G(X−ω) 有一个有效的表示 vG(X)=X|G|−1vG(X)=X|G|−1，这相比于上述乘积求值速度要快得多。\n3. 第三，我们可能想了解对 p(a)p(a) 的求值会发生什么。由于这个阶 d≥|G|d≥|G|，看起来这也需要很多努力。但这就是密码学发挥作用的地方：验证者永远不会自己求值实际多项式有如下各种原因。第一，如果验证者可以访问完整的多项式 p(X)p(X)，那么证明者应该将该多项式与证明一起发送，这将需要 d+1d+1个系数表示（对于一个SNARK来说这将不再简洁）。第二，这个多项式可能会携带一些秘密信息，如果验证者可以重新计算它的求值，他就可以通过在特定点求值来知道一些私有数据。因此，这些求值将只能成为“心理游戏”，这要归功于证明者发送的**多项式承诺**和**求值证明**（对他们来说，dd 数量级的计算不仅是可以接受的，而且是必要的）。实际证明长度将在很大程度上取决于我们使用的多项式承诺的类型。例如，在类Kate的承诺中，对多项式承诺会有常数数量的群元素（通常是一个），而在 Bulletproofs 中是对数个。但无论如何，这将比发送 O(d)O(d) 个元素要短。\n\n### \n\n \n 到目前为止，我们已经看到了如何只需一个点来检验在所有 GG 上多项式是否等于 0。 这在某种程度上本身就是一种聚合。 但是对于多个多项式，我们要分析如何来证明这件事。 总而言之，如果它们成立，这将意味着多项式编码了一个正确的证据，且关系将得到满足。 这些检查可以一个一个地执行（检查每个商是否确实正确），或者使用有效的聚合机制并一次只检查*一个更长的方程*。\n\n那么，执行这个一次性检查的最简单方法是什么？ 也许有人可以想到将所有方程 p0(X),…,pn(X)p0(X),…,pn(X) 加起来成为更长的方程 ∑ni=0pi(X)∑i=0npi(X)。 但是这样做会使得有些项相互之间抵消，从而可能会得到一个不正确的陈述。\n\n因此相反，我们可以将求和中的每个项乘以一个随机数。 这个技巧起作用的原因是随机数之间的独立性。 也就是说，如果两个不同的多项式 f(X)f(X) 和 g(X)g(X) 在给定的 X=xX=x 上都等于 0，那么同样的 xx 以很大概率会成为随机组合α⋅f(x)+β⋅g(x)=0α⋅f(x)+β⋅g(x)=0的一个根。 如果应用于整个语句，我们可以将 nn 个方程转换为单个方程， \n ⋀inpi(X)?=0⟺ w.h.p. n∑i=0ρi⋅pi(X)?=0⋀inpi(X)=?0⟺ w.h.p. ∑i=0nρi⋅pi(X)=?0 \n 到目前为止听起来都不错。 但是我们忘记了证明系统的一个重要部分，即证明长度。 为了使上述声明具有可靠性，用于聚合的随机值应该是验证者选择的，或者至少是独立于证明者的。 因此，如果验证者必须与证明者沟通以告知正在使用的随机值，我们将得到 nn 个域元素的开销。\n\n相反，我们可以使用另一种称为「**阿尔法之幂**」的技术。 在这里，我们假设一个随机值的幂 αiαi 与实际的另一个随机值 ρiρi 无法区分。 然后，我们可以将上述声明调整为仅使用一个与证明者协调一致的随机元素 αα ： \n ⋀inpi(X)?=0⟺ w.h.p. n∑i=0αi⋅pi(X)?=0⋀inpi(X)=?0⟺ w.h.p. ∑i=0nαi⋅pi(X)=?0\n\n## \n\n在上一节中，我们看到了如何非常有效地证明特定的方程在给定的数字集合上成立。 剩下要了解的是这些技术背后的动机。 为什么我们可以执行这些操作如此重要，这些方程在现实世界中代表什么？\n\n首先，让我们回顾一下这张总结了一些重要记号的表格： \n \n\n我们必须掌握的第一个想法是**电路**的概念。 一个电路可以被认为是一组用电线连接它们的门。 能想到的最简单的电路类型是布尔电路。 布尔电路只有二进制值：1 和 0，真和假。 从非常高的层次来看，布尔电路就像一个复杂的管道网络，其值可以被视为有水或无水。 然后，门将像旋塞阀一样，使水在管道之间流动或不流动。 然后，每一个反应都将表示为一个门（即逻辑门）。 可以有可以执行更多操作的电路，例如算术电路。 这里，可用的门类型将是算术运算（加法和乘法），线可以具有数值，可以执行任意计算。\n\n如果再动动脑筋，就可以构想出一个可以同时表示任何算术运算的“通用”门。 这种仔细构想的门就是在 Plonk 中使用其串联来描述任何关系的门。 除了线路之外，这些门还与一组有助于描述功能的**系数**相关联。但是这个门的问题在于它需要大量的该门来表示任何有意义的函数。 因此，最近出现了类 Plonk 的证明系统，它使用**自定义门**来更有效地表示重复使用的功能，而不是使用一系列相互连接的通用门。 Kimchi就是这些协议之一。 目前，我们支持如下操作的特定门：Poseidon 哈希函数、曲线点的 `CompleteAdd`

加密原语。\n\n电路结构是提前知道的，因为这是与验证者共享的公共信息的一部分。秘密的是我们称之为一个关系的**证据**，它是满足所有检验的电路的输入和线路的正确实例化。这意味着验证者知道电路的每个部分出现什么类型的门，以及附在每个部分的系数。\n\n门在矩阵中按行排列，列数根据需要加入（Plonk 需要 3列，而 Kimchi 目前使用 15列）。**执行迹**是指在证据实例化下整个电路中所有线路的状态。它将表示为一个表格，其中行对应于每个门，列指的是门的实际线路（也称为**输入和输出寄存器**）和计算所需的一些辅助值（也称为**建议寄存器**）。 Kimchi 的当前实现总共考虑了 15 列，前 7 列对应于 输入/输出寄存器。 排列论证作用于输入/输出寄存器（意思是，它将检查执行迹的前 7 列中的单元格是否正确复制到其目标单元格）。因此，这些检验也称为**复制约束**。\n\n> 令 3 个 Plonk 列的证据为 wL、wRwL、wR 和 wOwO，分别指左、右和输出。 与左、右、输出、乘法和标量的系数 cL、cR、cO、cM、cScL、cR、cO、cM、cS 一起，可以将通用算术运算表示为 \n 0=cL⋅wL+cR⋅wR+cO⋅wO+cM⋅wL⋅wR+cS0=cL⋅wL+cR⋅wR+cO⋅wO+cM⋅wL⋅wR+cS\n\n系数充当二元选择器，但标量系数可以是任何常数。例如，加法可以通过关闭乘法选择器 cMcM 来表示。\n\n回到该方案的主要动机，回想一下，我们想检验特定方程在给定的一组数字集合中是否成立。以下就是这种声明开始有意义的地方。执行迹中的总行数将为我们提供一个**求值域**。也就是说，我们定义了执行迹的每个行索引和乘法群 GG 的元素之间的映射，该乘法群的元素与表中的行一样多。这里需要注意两点。首先，如果不存在这样的群，我们可以用零填充。其次，任何乘法群都有一个生成元gg，它的幂生成整个群。然后我们可以为每一行分配 gg 的幂。我们为什么要这样做？因为这将成为我们要检查方程的那个集合：我们可以将关于群元素的声明转换为一个“这些属性对该表的每一行都适用”的声明。很有趣，对吧？", "timestamp":

{"id": "0vlJNcStHFk61buK1KbPSV_MPtXsAbQmxu5ijk3YyYY", "title": "Thoughts sharing on the emerging \"Asset Management as a Service\" (AMaaS) market", "body": "As of May 24th 2022, the last weeks have been a roller-coaster for the crypto & stock market and confirming the entrance into the bear territory: from the “algorithmic stable coin” UST losing its 1:1 peg and LUNA freefalling from $100 to $0.01, to BTC plunging below $30K, or more recently, [the Coinbase Q1FY22 report](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001679788/89c60d81-41a2-4a3c-86fb-b4067ab1016c.pdf) stating that users’ funds could be wiped out under a bankruptcy event scenario. These headlines have been the caviar of the breaking news, Twitter, LinkedIn, and even Instagram. I haven’t heard anyone from my IRL/online network not speaking, or complaining, about this drop in the last weeks.\n\nThe current state of the global economy and the endless crypto news have motivated me to finalize the draft of this article and share my thoughts on the emerging segment within FinTech that I call “ Asset Management as a Service”.\n\n### Definition & Introduction\n\nI discovered this new segment a few months ago while I was mingling across Discord groups to get deals data. Jumping in a brief chat with a user, who seems someone financially literate, led me to the bottomless crypto-asset diversification debate and my first introduction to “Asset Management as a Service”. I could define it as the way to manage and invest clients/LPs’ funds without the need to have ownership and total access and/or control over the financial assets. On the opposite of the traditional approach, where Clients/LPs give up ownership and full control of their funds over a fixed time. It leverages multiple technologies like APIs, AI/ML, and blockchain to disrupt the legacy Asset Management space.\n\nAfter a quick research, the recent data and metrics related to Asset Management blew my mind: this juicy industry [sized $103 trillion in 2021](https://web-assets.bcg.com/79/bf/d1d361854084a9624a0cbce3bf07/bcg-global-asset-management-2021-jul-2021.pdf), and retail portfolios represented 41% of global assets, or $42 trillion according to BCG. The global crypto trend & pandemic have largely contributed to the spike in interest of retail investors for investment products. The US equity trading activity [has doubled since the beginning of the pandemic](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-new-way-to-look-at-retail-trading-trends), rising from around $18 billion/day (pre-2020) to around $32 billion/day in March 2020. And the number of crypto owners is expected to grow from [295 million to 1 billion](https://assets.ctfassets.net/hfgyig42jimx/5i8TeN1QYJDjn82pSuZB5S/85c7c9393f3ee67e456ec780f9bf11e3/Cryptodotcom_Crypto_Market_Sizing_Jan2022.pdf) by the end of 2022. The metrics from some companies operating in this space raised my attention to further dive in, like Kryll.io which managed to reach [+$3.5 billion traded volumes in April 2022](https://blog.kryll.io/kryll-changelog-monthly-progress-report-april-2022-metrics/) and operate/use across 112 countries. Or Zignaly, the profit-sharing/copy-trading platform gathers +55K users and manages +$60M AUM through API-linked crypto trading accounts up to date.\n\n### The Market Drivers\n\nAlthough the industry has seen some innovation over the past decade, it still remains fundamentally conservative given the nature of the business. In my opinion, the structural changes and new technologies applied to finance will be key drivers of AMaaS :\n\n·        First and foremost, the global population is getting more educated about the Financial Market and the basics of Personal Finance. The multiplication of trading apps and neo-banks offering stock/crypto investing products depict this new generation's willingness to keep full control and ownership over their financial assets. According to [The Motley Fool survey 2021](https://www.fool.com/research/what-are-gen-z-millennial-investors-buying/), 73% of Gen Z investors and 66% of millennial investors own stocks, and unsurprisingly, 40% of stock investors aged 18 to 40 own cryptocurrencies. It demonstrates a growing interest in the financial industry, Charles Swab talks now about the [“Generation I(nvestor)”.](https://www.aboutschwab.com/generation-investor-study-2021)\n\n·        The decentralization of Investment Management knowledge outside of the banking/hedge fund industry and the growing individual/independent investor community across social networks largely participate in the change of the Asset Management landscape. The episode of [Reddit’s traders vs HFs](https://www.ft.com/content/7a91e3ea-b9ec-4611-9a03-a8dd3b8bddb5), or the [anonymous Twitter user explaining step by step how to break Terra](https://twitter.com/FreddieRaynolds/status/1463960623402913797) in Nov. 2021,  illustrates the capacity of some retail investors to research/act like \"professional\" investors. The community aspect and knowledge sharing play a crucial role in the Future of Asset Management: favoriting the \"multiplayer\" and \"community-belonging\" sentiment lead to higher engagement. A16Z addresses better the community-first social investing topic in the \"[Big ideas that fintech will tackle in 2022](https://a16z.com/2021/12/20/the-big-ideas-that-fintech-will-tackle-in-2022/#:\\~:text=In%202022%2C%20we'll%20see,fiat%20and%20crypto%20financial%20lives)” post. Additionally, the myriad of FinMeme/StockMeme accounts genuinely outline the exponential factor of Community in the global financial industry.\n\n·        Aforementioned above, trading platforms blossoming over the past years have upside down the traditional investing/trading market by granting commission-free, low-capital access, and fractional shares trading. The financial market consumerization and the democratization of retail investing activities play a subsequent stake in the emergence of AMaaS, as well as, participate in the popularization of new investment instruments, like NFTs or cryptocurrencies. Technical innovations applied to Financial Services – like APIs, Blockchain, Bots, or AI/ML – are the main drivers of this new market. Quantitative/algorithmic investment strategies are getting more traction within the stock market in the past years (e.g. Two Sigma, Renaissance Technologies…), and automation has become a norm in the Finance industry.  \n APIs can allow anyone to manage your brokerage/trading account with specific restrictions. Blockchain – especially smart contracts – acts as a safeguard/trusted-third party. Bots automize investment strategies while minimizing cognitive biases. Venture investments have started to hit the space, and startups have begun to stand out, such as the US-company Alpaca building a developer-first API for stock/crypto trading that secured [+$70M from VC firms](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/alpaca-raises-50m-to-rapidly-scale-its-equities-trading-api-business/), or Zignaly developing a profit-sharing based copy-trading platform for digital assets raised +$50M.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads me to think of a future where people would easily access  \"plug and play\" alpha-generating services within a few clicks. And anyone would be able to start \"independent\" Asset Management activities with enterprise-grade tools/ infrastructures.\n\n### Applications\n\nFrom my investigation, the AMaaS landscape is growing over the days and attracting more retail and institutional investors. Applications within this space include: marketplaces matching Asset Managers & customers, investment strategy creation/rental/sell/purchase platform, NFT-based asset management, DAO, wallet-2-wallet following, API-based trading infrastructure/web3 infrastructure, and enterprise-grade tools for retail investors/independent Asset Managers. Find below some interesting companies that I have spotted operating in this space.\n\n![Segment mapping](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sw5IVoRmZPCOy1NsK6oZV.jpg?height=720&width=1280)\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this blog post! if you have any questions and comments, or just want to chat, please feel free to [reach out to me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-chen-t-h-3b40ba122/).", "timestamp": 1653394747, "digest": "xef0SVcMogbBxBeMgXrWAPF5MVyHBR_b0y9FHU4N1bw", "contributor": "0x7d9372104C7A46Ec8644aDb77dcC63b4d6f2A1cb"}

{"id": "OB0nfJfvivF4dC7VU6PSc-T90NE_M4WRzAabZTWVJS8", "title": "学会爱上阅读", "body": "学会爱上阅读\n\n（关于书籍、博客等具体推荐请看“纳瓦尔推荐的读物”部分。） 真正爱上阅读本身，一旦把这个培养起来，就是一股超强的力量。我们生活在亚历山大时代，每本书和每段曾被写下的知识我们现在都可以触手可及。学习的手段丰富——学习的欲望稀缺。\n\n我记得祖父母在印度的房子。我还是小孩的时候，就在地板上读完了祖父全部的《读者文摘》，那是祖父必须要去读的所有书。现在，当然，外面有一大堆庞杂的信息——任何人都可以随时阅读任何东西。 回到当时，阅读的内容非常有限。我读过连环画、故事书以及任何其它我可以弄到手的东西。 我认为我一直喜欢阅读，是因为我其实是一个不爱社交且内向的人。我从小迷失在文字和思想的世界里。我认为其中有一部分原因是来自我小时候快乐的环境，那时我还年轻，没有人强迫我去读某些特定的东西。 我认为父母和老师都有一种偏向会说，“噢，你应该读这个，而不是读那个。”我读了大量被认为（以今天的标准）是精神垃圾食品的书。\n\n读你所爱读的直到你爱上阅读。\n\n你几乎必定会读你正在读的东西，因为你已沉浸其中。你不需要任何其它的原因。没有什么必须要完成的任务。就纯粹是阅读，因为你乐在其中。\n\n现在，我发现我自己重读的次数和我读的次数一样多。来自@illacertus（译者注：动漫《权力的48条法则》的作者）的一条推文说，“我不想去读完所有书，我只想反复读那100本伟大的书。”我认为这个说法很有道理。更加重要的是识别出对你来说很好的书，因为不同的书面向不同的人。然后，你可以做到真正掌握那些。\n\n看一本书不是一场比赛——越好的书，就越要慢慢地理解和吸收。\n\n我不知道你们的情况，但是我的注意力非常差。我略读。我快速阅读。我跳读。我无法告知你书中特定的段落或引文。在更深的层次上，你理解了它们，它们就成为了你心灵网络中的线。它们被编织在里面。\n\n我肯定你会有这样的感觉，你拿起一本书开始读的时候，你可能会说，“这是十分有趣的。这是十分好的。”你越读越有种似曾相识的感觉。接着，读到一半的时候，你意识到，“我以前读过这本书。”那是很好的。这就意味着你准备重读这本书。 事实上，我读过的书不多。我挑选了很多书，但仅看完了那几本构成我知识的基础的书。\n\n事实是，我其实没有像人们所认为的那样读了很多书。我大概每天读一到两小时。那个使我进入0.00001%的行列。我认为单单用这个就足以说明我生命中已经取得的任何物质成就，以及我所可能拥有的智慧。真正的人不会每天读一小时。我认为，真正的人，每天读一分钟或更少。使它成为实际的习惯才是最重要的事情。\n\n你读什么几乎不重要。最终，你会读到足够多的东西（你的兴趣将会引导你到那里），这能显著改善你生活。就像对你来说最好的锻炼就是每天都能充满激情地去锻炼，我要说的是，对于书籍、博客、推特或任何东西——任何有想法、信息和学习的东西——最值得去读的是那些一直能让你兴奋的东西。\n\n只要我手里有一本书，就不会觉得浪费时间。 ——查理.芒格\n\n每个人的大脑工作方式不同。一些人喜欢去做笔记。事实上，我在推特上做笔记。我不断地去阅读。如果我有一些基础的“啊哈”式的洞察或概念，推特迫使我将这些浓缩成短短的几句话。然后，我试着把它当作格言放在那里。接着，我会被随机的人评判，他们会指出各种明显的例外，并且猛烈抨击我。再接着，我就会想，“为什么我要再次做这个？”\n\n指出明显的例外，就说明了要么是目标不够聪明，要么是你不够聪明。\n\n当你第一次拿起书的时候，你会快速浏览你感兴趣的内容吗？你会怎样去读它呢？你会随便翻开一页就开始读吗？你的阅读过程是怎么样的？ 我会从页首开始，不过我翻得非常快。如果是不感兴趣的，我就会快速向前翻、略过或快速阅读。如果在第一章不能以一个有意义且积极的方式吸引我的注意力，我将会停止读这本书或者跳过前面几章继续往下读。 那里有无数的书供你去阅读，所以我不相信延迟满足。有如此多的好书。\n\n读书数量完全是一种虚荣的指标。就如你知道得更多，你就会留下更多未读完的书。关注具有预言力量的新概念。\n\n通常，我是略读。我会快速向前读。我尝试去发现能吸引我的那部分。许多书都有一个观点要去表达。 （很明显的，我说的是非虚构的，而不是说虚构的。）他们提出了一个观点，他们为了证实观点，然后他们会提供一个又一个的例子，他们会应用这个去解释世界上的一切。一旦，我感觉到我已经掌握要旨，我非常舒服地把书放下。有一些我称之为伪科学的畅销书.....人们会说，“噢，你读过这本书吗？”我总是说是的，但事实是我也许只读了两章。我就得到要旨了。\n\n如果他们写这个是为了赚钱，就不要读这个了。 你是按照什么做法去内化/组织书中信息的呢？向其他人解释你所学到的东西。以教促学。\n\n这是不是关于“受过教育”和“没受过教育”的问题。这是关于“喜欢阅读”和“不喜欢阅读”的问题。 在接下来的六十天里，我可以做些什么让自己成为一个清晰且独立的思考者？ 阅读数学、科学和哲学领域的大师作品。忽略掉你的同代人和新闻。避免大众的认同。真理高于社会认同。\n\n学习逻辑和数学，因为一旦你掌握了它们，你就不怕任何书了。\n\n图书馆里没有书可以吓到你。无论是数学、物理学、电力工程学、社会学还是经济学的书。你应该可能拿下书架上任何书，并阅读它。有些书对你来说可能很困难。没关系——无论如何都要读它们。然后不断重复地读它们，读到懂。 当你读一本书感到困惑的时候，这些困惑就类似于你在健身房锻炼时会感到痛苦。只不过你是在锻炼精神肌肉而不是身体的肌肉。学会如何去学习和阅读书籍。\n\n关于“只是阅读”的问题是外面有如此多的垃圾。作家的种类就像人的种类一样多。他们之中许多人写了大量的垃圾。\n\n我认为在我生活中遇到的那些非常博学的人，并不是很聪明。主要是因为虽然他们非常博学，但他们以错误的次序阅读了错误的东西。他们一开始读的是一系列虚假的或部分真实的东西，这些东西组成他们世界观的基本公理。然后，当新事物出现时，他们根据他们已经建立的基础来评判这些新想法。所以，你的基础是至关重要的。\n\n因为许多人都害怕数学，不能独立去评判数学，所以他们往往会高估用数学/伪科学支持的观念。 最好的方式是拥有一个高质量的基础（你也许不喜欢这个回答），但诀窍就是坚持科学和坚持基础。通常，你只会读到一小部分他人不反对的东西。很少有人不同意2+2=4，不是吗？这是严肃的知识。数学是坚实的基础。 同样，硬科学也是坚实的基础。微观经济学也是坚实的基础。当你游离于这些坚实基础之外时，你会陷入苦恼，因为现在你已经不知什么是真的和什么假的。我会尽我所能把重点放在构建坚实基础上。 比深入学习高等数学，擅长算术和几何学可能更好。我愿意一整天读微观经济学——微观经济学入门。\n\n要做到这个的另一种方式是阅读原著和阅读经典。如果你对进化论感兴趣，就去读查尔斯.罗伯特.达尔文的书。而不是从理查德.道金斯（译者注：《自私的基因》的作者）开始（尽管我认为他是伟大的）。先读达尔文的，再读道金斯的。 如果你想去学宏观经济学，可以先读亚当.斯密（《道德情操论》、《国富论》作者）、冯.米塞斯（奥地利经济学派）或者哈耶克（《通往奴役之路》作者）。从最初的经济哲学家开始。如果你想学习共产主义或社会主义思想（我个人没有学这个），可以先读卡尔.马克思（《资本论》作者）。不要读当前那些解释性的，因为那些人正在向你灌输事情应该如何做和运行。\n\n如果你开始就用原著作为你的基础，那么你就有足够的世界观和理解力，你将不会怕任何书。然后，你只管去学就好了。如果你是一台永远的学习机器，你就永不会失去赚钱的选择。你总是能够看到社会上出现了什么，价值是什么，需求在哪里，你就会加快学习速度跟上。\n\n要想思路清晰，就要理解基础。如果你记住了高级概念但无法根据需要重新推导它们，你就是困惑的。 我们现在处于推特和Facebook的时代。我们正在获得简洁精辟的智慧，这其实是很难掌握的。作为一个现代人去读那些书是非常困难的，因为我们已经被训练过了。我们有两个矛盾的训练： 一个是我们的注意力持续时间已经非常短了，因为我们一直被如此多的信息包围。我们想要跳过、总结、切入正题。 推特已经使我们成为糟糕的读者，但成为了更好的作者。\n\n另一方面，我们也被从小教育要把书读完。书是神圣的——当你去上学并被要求去读一本书，你不得不把书读完。随着时间的流逝，我们忘记了怎样去读书。就我所知的每个人都粘在某本书上了（译者注：趴在书上睡了）。\n\n我可以肯定你现在正卡在某些东西上——可以是第232页，你不能再往前走了，但你知道你应该要读完这本书。所以你会做什么呢？你会暂时放弃读书。 对我来说，放弃阅读是一场悲剧。我是在书中长大的，然后我转到博客，再然后我转到推特和Facebook，最后我意识到我其实学不到任何东西。我只是整日吃着小多巴胺的零食。我得到了我小140字的多巴胺。我发推特，然后留意谁转推了我的推文。这是有趣和令人高兴的事情，但这是我在玩的一个游戏。\n\n我意识到我必须回去读书。 我知道这是非常困难的问题，因为我的大脑已经被训练成习惯花时间在Facebook、推特和其它那些数字平台上了。 我想出了一个好办法，我开始把书当作随手可得的博客文章、推文或帖子。我觉得没有义务去读完任何书。现在，当有人向我提及一本书，我会买下它。在任何指定的时间，我都在10到20本之间穿插阅读。我正在翻阅它们。\n\n如果书籍有些无聊，我就会跳读。有时，我会从中间开始读一本书，因为有些段落会吸引我。我将会从那里继续读下去，我觉得没有任何义务去读完这本书。突然间，书籍又回到了我的阅读库。那是极好的，因为书中有古老的智慧。\n\n解决问题的时候：问题越老，解决方法也越老。 如果你尝试去学习如何开小车或开飞机，你应该读一些现代人写的东西，因为这个问题在现代才出现，最好的解决方法在现代。\n\n如果你说的是一个老问题，像如何保持身体健康、如何保持心态平和、什么类型的价值系统是好的、怎么养家糊口以及其它类似的问题，老的解决方法可能更好。 任何一本能存活两千多年的书，都是经过很多人筛选的。一般原则更有可能是正确的。我想重新开始读这类书籍。 你知道那首歌是你无法忘怀的歌吗？所有想法都是这样起作用的。注意你所读的东西。 一个冷静的大脑，一个健康的身体，一间充满爱的房子。 这些东西是买不到的。 他们一定是赚来的。\n\n\\#读书 #阅读 #笔记 #例外 #例外反例 #《纳瓦尔宝典》 #过滤器", "timestamp": 1653394928, "digest": "4uV1h2g2OLmleBvpkSXg_XEskvKs47ut3kuZzMud7rM", "contributor": "0xF7DB34e780FD944FD90dcF1FacC3eCB18e154469"}

在艺术水准上执行非常完美，包括色调一致性，精美又夸张的杜绝，轮廓独特等，一些1:1图片（详见后文对比图）制作改编时相当体现功力。他认为这种原创水准的一致性能赋予作品艺术上的份量和深度。\n\n他说，人们可以在几秒种内识别原创艺术和山寨土狗之间的区别，并指出这是BAYC、DOODLES和Azuki艺术上能成立，而ZIPCY等其他项目无法成功的原因。\n\n![三大原创](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yKlgLFErNgNf6RKawe-1F.png?height=386&width=735)\n\n作者还列出了2张从上述原创作品而来的“图狗”作为对比：\n\n![图狗仿盘](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1J9yw8sK7F-qH6x2twinm.png?height=413&width=735)\n\n同时还列举了其他的官方内容，认为项目在整体艺术风格执行上非常好。\n\n同时，他强调说，实际上，丑陋或怪诞很难有吸引力，特别是对于欧美人来说，因为大家习惯了迪士尼的“培训”，因此，作者认为[@goblintownwtf](https://twitter.com/goblintownwtf) 的风格是“令人印象深刻的壮举”。\n\n实际上，研究员人员发现，项目确实做到了观察到项目的每个人都对这些哥布林印象深刻——无论觉得他们“超酷”或是“太丑”。\n\n### 三、项目特色\n\n哥布林官网呈现它独特的风格，通过一个很酷的动画和两个地精之间的“哥布林语”对话将整个村落的氛围呈现，十分独特，十分酷炫。\n\n![官网](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2k4BD2sqpolFuQnTXh9OH.png?height=648&width=882)\n\n在官网下方有一个个相框，旁边标注着family，点击之后会跳出团队页面，但我们无法从中窥探出团队成员有哪一些人组成，一般来说，匿名的项目会显得不够友好，但当人们厌倦了明星和大咖们的失败之后，有着独特风格的项目变得更加讨喜一点。\n\n![神秘团队](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Wundad4D5eGa1PIj822JT.png?height=641&width=876)\n\n区别于主流的NFT项目，这个项目并没有路线图，甚至也没有DC，项目方似乎想做的是一个没有社区没有路线也没有实用程序的meme型的NFT，而这给项目带来了更多的悬念和关注。\n\n官方进行了一场充满仪式感的语音SPACE，每个人都在怪异的声音说着“哥布林语”，听起来就像是疯子的聚会——其中一位观众发言询问路线图之类，被粗暴打断，而在社区人们甚至在欢呼幸好打断了，以免氛围被破坏。\n\nGoblintown项目在所有的渠道都在用“哥布林语”，甚至在推特space里也在用哥布林语，包括最新的投票，人们都需要破译。\n\n![投票](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XKkSxL2mRPlZ7PG4TQr3C.png?height=309&width=543)\n\n项目方的种种做法，透露出营销水平较为高明，效果也较好，在发布后的几天，是ETH链上表现最好的NFT项目。\n\n### 四、市场营销\n\n项目在5月20号晚上公开free mint，但直到五月21号在被linksdao创始人[@mdudas](https://twitter.com/mdudas/status/1527802366292025344?s=20&t=QfrBZFqTOsha8_9JlQPEow) 提及后一个小时内Free mint售罄，并且OS交易量冲到了30多个ETH。\n\n![市场](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3fKUZvYfgaVdPKd5GxS6W.png?height=450&width=542)\n\n随后，许多人开始猜测哥布林的团队背景，甚至有人根据一些线索认为哥布林是yugalabs的秘密项目，真假莫辫之下，各种转推让项目的热度开始上升。地板在当天来到0.1ETH。\n\n5月22号4点，官推否认yugalabs有关，随后疑似承认@steveaoki是Goblintown的创始人。\n\n![营销](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C9T3ycQlEzU2bkgBAhlrn.png?height=969&width=911)\n\n[@steveaoki](https://twitter.com/steveaoki) 是一个有着825万粉丝DJ，音乐人，是北美巡演票房最高的电子舞曲艺人，同时也发行了A0K1VERSE Passport项目，目前地板0.149，总交易量148，前期地板高峰时0.8E，目前交易量极尽萎缩。\n\n而在整个NFT的系列中，一共有12个1:1，其中#5948号和[@steveaoki](https://twitter.com/steveaoki) 确实有一些像。\n\n![对比图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JKzLjasAIHjR-wkydGEHp.png?height=495&width=936)\n\n这让哥布林的地板价飙升至0.18，而且交易量迅速放大，FOMO情绪和共识都在不断的累积，各类鲜活的表情包开始迅速传播（国外NFT圈子对表情包、动图等使用很广泛）。\n\n但是，根据我们的研究，可以确认，项目方更多的是在蹭热度，是一种“巧妙”的营销，因为在[@steveaoki](https://twitter.com/steveaoki) 的推特我们不会搜索到任何goblin相关内容。\n\n而且，官推在六个小时之后，又发了同样格式的推文，宣称自己不是[@steveaoki](https://twitter.com/steveaoki) ，而是 [@Beeple](https://baike.baidu.com/item/Beeple/58632391?fr=aladdin) （一位传奇的NFT艺术家，其单幅NFT作品在佳士得拍卖行售价高达6025万美元）\n\n![营销](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZqC1gIocgZtpO6nLRAVJ0.png?height=830&width=898)\n\n这或许是一种不错的营销方式，但其体现的价值观是否够好值得思考。\n\n在此之外，官方还设置了多个“神秘彩蛋”NFT未开图，目前在OS人们给出了7的offer。官推不断更新相关推文，留悬念设置，预示蛋会有一些特殊的故事可以讲。\n\n目前为止，官方推特活跃度极高，从5月18日发送第一条推特到我写下这篇文章5月23号，已经发表了近600多条推特，平均一天近100条。\n\n### 五、链上数据\n\n首先看一下总体成交历史，最高价区间到了0.8-1左右，0.5是密集换手区间。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q0G0WQYp3GlUmGQTi3rVW.png?height=559&width=1866)\n\n根据NFTGO数据，目前项目蓝筹指数为25.74%，上线几天持续增长中，其中BAYC和猴子地的持有者最多，月鸟次之，具体如下图：\n\n![蓝筹指数](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/75XB_qKdurhuDUfPdWXup.png?height=346&width=674)\n\n目前项目持有人数4305人，作为上线不到一周的新项目来讲，分布相当不错，许多项目上线一两个月持有人数还破不了2000，同时目前持有者分布中，持有1个NFT的人数较多，具体见下图：\n\n![持有者分布](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t_wlByI-rRHhDfRPjMSHq.png?height=361&width=1121)\n\n### 六、研究总结\n\n总体来说，这是一个艺术风格鲜明，营销手段高明的另类项目，和传统项目买推特假粉、大搞抽奖转发、DC搞机器人不同，项目方没有用这些招数，但却获得了较高的市场热度，这是熊市背景下难得的优秀案例。\n\n如果说，Mfers的成功让人们对原创与某种文化产生了向往，而Goblintown这个没有语言差异，没有地区差异，没有性别差异的哥布林出现时，妖精镇的故事让各种不同文化的人都有了不同的收获。\n\n尤其是近期solana链的NFT爆火而导致ETH链上的NFT玩家们期待有一个ETH链项目能提振士气，或许也是一个资金急切寻找的口子。\n\n从项目方的总体营销来讲，悬念、故事，原创的艺术与语言等都值得持续跟踪观察。\\[end\\]\n\n>

{"id": "zq-1gRLUGxGDoRTJFjn61-K_b2a-7awEFaiHw9ggyzw", "title": "忍让", "body": "       一个人能“忍”的程度也是他可以负荷的程度，成大事者莫不从危机四伏的社会中杀出一条“血路”来，其间所忍受和承受的远远超乎想象。从另一个角度来看，那些能够忍耐常人所不能忍之事的人，心中必定是有所图的，如果不幸这样的人心胸不够宽广的话，将来一定会伺机报复，不可不小心防范。1805年奥斯特利茨战役和1807年弗里德兰战役中，俄军被法军打得大败，实力大大减弱，刚登基的亚历山大一世为重整旗鼓，与拿破仑展开了新的较量，与以往不同的是，这次他使用了新的“壮举”，卑躬屈膝地讨好对方，处处表现出退让的姿态，以屈求伸。\n\n       1808年，拿破仑决定邀请亚历山大在埃尔特宫举行会晤。这次会晤，是拿破仑为了避免两线同时作战，用法俄两国的伟大友谊来威慑奥地利。亚历山大认为目前俄国的力量不足对抗拿破仑，还必须佯装同意拿破仑的建议，并向他“献媚取宠”，争取准备的时间，妥善做好准备，时机一到，就从容不迫地促成拿破仑垮台。有一次看戏，当女演员念出伏尔泰《奥狄浦斯》剧中的一句台词，“和大人物结交，真是上帝恩赐的幸福”时，亚历山大一脸真诚地说：“我在此每天都深深感到这一点。”这使拿破仑非常满意。\n\n       又一次，亚历山大有意去解腰间的佩剑，发现自己忘了佩戴，而拿破仑把自己刚刚解下的宝剑赐赠给亚历山大，亚历山大装作很感动的样子，热泪盈眶地说：“我把它视作您的友好表示予以接受，陛下可以相信，我将永不举剑反对您。”拿破仑对他也彻底消除了戒备。1812年，俄法之间的利益冲突已经十分尖锐，这时亚历山大认为俄国已做好准备，于是借故挑起战争，并且打败了拿破仑。亚历山大总结经验教训时说：“拿破仑认为我不过是个傻瓜，可是谁笑到最后，谁就笑得最好。”亚历山大伪装自己，使拿破仑放松了警惕，又暗中壮大自己的势力，最终打败了对方。\n\n        拿破仑被亚历山大“忍让”迷惑了，终于失掉了自己的帝国。在很多时刻，忍让并非是出自真心，而是在暗中积蓄力量，如果你没有看到它背后的企图，到时，吃亏的一定是你。“忍耐”可以让权力转换在瞬间完成，那些看似波澜不惊的退让会使你在几个回合之后，失掉自己的优势。在中世纪的欧洲，国王的权力来自教皇，君权神授，神权高于君权。1076年兵荒马乱时，德意志帝国皇帝亨利与罗马教皇格里高利争权夺利，斗争日益激烈，最后发展到了势不两立的地步。", "timestamp": 1653394943, "digest": "pU2iNqZNmttUHpLnOX7KRDKp4A2SZE1HxdkCIi9rj6w", "contributor": "0x99704E53df81B00c34F54e04FdCF85C613E810D5"}

{"id": "3zFmottsLt8wDkKVDD_n5Ip1ESQzfoz5ANCKzEp_0QI", "title": "Rigorous Research and the Art of Good Writing", "body": "Author: [Luca Prosperi](https://twitter.com/LucaProsperi)\n\nEditor: [Kate Lee](https://twitter.com/katelaurielee)\n\nGraphics: [Tina He](https://twitter.com/fkpxls)\n\n\n---\n\nI used to believe the secret of good writing resided within the writer. During those times I wrote very little.\n\nI heard from others that the formula was instead to be found within the reader. Those were typically prolific writers. But their dramatisation of other people’s lives came with inebriating effects, and most became victims of their own courtship. I learned that many prolific writers are lonely.\n\nWith time I understood that a good story is necessary for beautiful writing, one that takes its time to burn through the clothes and the skin.\n\nI was in the middle of my thirties, young and strong and proud, when I got sick. The white-stain-on-your-chest-X-ray-type of sick. And so I met pain, first, and then fear, hope, and fatigue. Pain makes for good writing, too.\n\nThrough the long months of isolation and chemotherapy, I saw the face of generosity,  love, and care. I benefited from undeserved luck while others didn’t, and I tried to sustain ignorance and nonchalance without nausea. I saw my own death, too, uneventful and unimpressive, and at the bottom of all that, I saw myself. Young and old and dead and alive. I saw time. Many had told me that facing illness at a young age brings a new perspective on the future. I learned that such an epiphany, if there is one, has nothing to do with clarity about one’s future, but rather everything to do with the density of one’s past.\n\nWith the benefit of the empty space left by my own life temporarily retrenching, I started [Dirt Roads, a newsletter that analyses the way financial value flows through complex systems](https://dirtroads.substack.com). In a sector almost fully oriented toward the reinvention of pre-existing concepts and process, Dirt Roads became a memento on the importance of the past while trying to navigate the present.\n\nBefore becoming a researcher, an investor, and a builder in decentralised finance, I spent the previous 15 years in the traditional one. Here you go, again, the past. That experience helped, a lot, because joining forces with innovators and visionaries can be frustrating if you have already lost all remaining tolerance for bullshit, like I had. Dirt Roads became a useful tool to extract meaning from the tumultuous and utopian developments of tech and finance, and to refuse to indulge the tendency to blindly worship prophets. As my writing evolved, I settled on formulas that started to repeat themselves while never losing sight of the concept that no one can be sure whether what you cannot see truly exists. Its superpowers: a matter-of-fact technical mindset based on first principles and observable quantitative metrics, an aversion to simplification and exaggeration, and as much brutal transparency as I can stomach.\n\nI haven't always been successful in applying that formula to my work and, when I lost some rigour, I got hurt. On October 21 of last year, [I wrote enthusiastically about the protocol Klima](https://dirtroads.substack.com/p/-19-klima-a-family-story?r=k87cd&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)’s ambition to corner the carbon credit market. I backed my enthusiasm with a financial investment, perfunctorily noting the tech and legal details around the tokenisation of real-world contracts, as well as $KLIMA token price levels. Those mundane details turned out to be the epicentre of the whole investment thesis, and I lost money. $KLIMA’s adjusted price fell from around $4,000 to $200 (a drop of 95%) and hasn't yet shown signs of recovery. I also learned that others, smarter and less self-concerned than I, made all the money that the rest of us lost. My analysis of Klima’s carbon green hole remains my least rigorous and most flawed; ironically, it is among my most popular pieces.\n\nThe pieces that I wrote without fear, reverence for others, or self-concern have been more successful. In December, rowing against the current, [I exposed](https://dirtroads.substack.com/p/-27-meet-abracadabras-money-team?r=k87cd&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) the significant flaws behind the Abracadabra project, a platform that allows users to take insanely high leverage on certain investment strategies with much lower yield and (theoretically) risk. Among the latter was excessive centralisation, with five out of the six votes required to execute crucial and sensitive operations concentrated in the hands of the controlling team. Two months later, someone named Sifu, one of those multisig holders––i.e., a key decision-maker––was revealed to be Sir Michael Patryn from QuadrigaCX, or actually Omar Dhanani, or whatever his original name was. A serial fraudster of gigantic dimensions—if you want to know more, [Netflix has you served](https://youtu.be/vW2BPQ15OSw). On the automated exchange Curve Finance, the main liquidity gate to and from Abracadabra’s stablecoin $MIM, people rushed for the door. Narrative and market conditions have stabilised a bit since then, but $MIM still represents 68% of Curve’s liquidity pool––so although the coin pitches itself as a perfect substitute for the U.S. dollar, the market thinks it is not. I’m convinced that the issue behind Abracadabra’s turmoil wasn’t the idiosyncrasies of human behaviour, but rather the bad design and fragility of its incentive structure. In the long run, incentives win against everything else, and incentives can be scrutinised beforehand.\n\nBut sound analytics don’t win elections, and not many readers cared about the Abracadabra piece. People don’t want to be reminded of the ineluctability of things; they want to ignore their limits and explore the limitless space of the rationally implausible. People want both tax cuts and budget deficits, the coziness of welfare support combined with the ruthlessness of unbounded capitalism. They know well that it is logically impossible, but that doesn’t make it less desirable.\n\nReaders are people and writers are people, too. And where readers crave optimism, writers salivate for recognition. Two sides of the same rusty coin: the exaggeration of our own importance as individuals, the denial of the vastness and carelessness of the universe, and the inability to face our own death. I am exaggerating, but only a bit. There is a lot of self-referencing at play, with writers feeding their insecurity by serving readers who are doing the same by worshipping others. A happy and oblivious reader makes for a happy and successful writer. It is somewhat recursive. The catch is that in the long run, nobody cares––neither about oblivion nor success. But a vast majority of popular writing is not so much about the future as it is about amusement in the present. Most popular writing is like an *Avenger* movie: colourful, explosive, unrealistic, entertaining, and ultimately irrelevant.\n\nSo what’s left for good writing? the good reader would ask. To be a channel, a bidirectional warp across spacetime, a phone call that doesn’t care about being asynchronous, I would answer. Good writing can be one of the most powerful vectors for intergenerational and interspatial shared living. This is no little thing. Good writing should aim for popularity over a much (much) longer time horizon.\n\nHistory has had rare moments when politics, ethics, demographics, and climate conjured to create a space of fecund cultural exploration and great writing. We had it in Paris in the 1920s, where Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Pound, Joyce, and others all sat around the tables of the same cafes and ingurgitated the same brands of spirits. We had it also in the deplorable yet limitless Berlin of Kastner and Stefan Zweig, in the same city that less than a decade later would plunge into the horrors of book-burning and goose-stepping. For some reason the moments of intense social and cultural development seem destined to rapidly decay into wealth polarisation and social unrest. The correlation between the highs and lows of human endeavours within a compressed time span seems almost scientifically predictable. The Great Decentralisation wrought by cryptography and web3 technology is following a similar path. I believe we are in the midst of another of those rare moments of conjunctural perfection that can lead to good writing; our duty is to make the most of it while conditions allow.\n\nMy aim, as a writer and curator, is to make Dirt Roads an open door to an environment where we can turn down the volume, ignore the reflexivity that pervades the public domain, and engage in respectful criticism. Today, we can set the rules of engagement of the room we operate in and let that room mould us. The same concept surely applies to every realm of human knowledge, but I am humble enough to narrow the call to action to our own sector, finance and technology. Rather than prizing immediate (and temporary) recognition, we could hack the rules of communication and knowledge sharing to reinforce durable responsibility for what we have said, and how. Rather than adopting the most effective techniques to hide ourselves while attracting attention, we could equip such a room with ruthless honesty, and a sense of pride about who we are and what we represent.\n\nIt can hurt to stay idle while others frantically move around us. It feels unnatural and unnerving. Yet if we accelerate a film fast enough, while rapid movements become trajectories and ultimately almost invisible blurs, it is only those who stand still that remain visible to the eye.\n\n\n---\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_ykF6mNCJl8Y0d9aUC4-X.png?height=766&width=1532)\n\n**The future of work is coming, and we are all its contributors.**\n\n**[Newstand](https://app.station.express/terminal/stationlabs/initiative/3)** is where we begin to define this new world of online collaboration.

"11\n\n既然佩特拉都得到了消息，埃尔文只可能比她知道得更早。他接到电话时，那长达三天的盛会已接近尾声。\n\n月季盛开的花园中人影如梭。身为唯二主角之一的埃尔文站在一顶如莲叶般硕大的白色遮阳伞下，与某证券公司董事的女儿相谈甚欢。午宴后，他换上一件轻薄的亚麻休闲西装，手持一杯脏马天尼，一副度假的派头。阳伞裙边在风中优雅地飘摆，暗青的橄榄在晕白的酒液中轻轻撞击着杯壁。如果说钻石有千万个切面，此刻光芒四射的，无疑是那格外明快的一面。\n\n女孩儿年纪尚轻，在纽约大学念数学。维多利亚的面子就有那么大，或者说嫁入史密斯家的可能性就有那么吸引人，正值暑假，她匆匆回国，在生日宴上和埃尔文打个照面，次日就要马不停蹄地赶回纽约，好开始在美林证券的暑期实习。与全职运营跑车俱乐部的某地产公司二代相比，她和埃尔文还算有共同语言。\n\n她首先谈了谈自己的职业规划。千篇一律地，打算先干几年IB，再跳槽到PE。这样一来，就拥有了一份亮眼的简历，日后回国，不管是求职还是相亲，她都会有十二分的底气。这话当然是说不出口的——龌龊了，但某些家境优渥的孩子在学校、在职场上下而求索，背后就是这样的逻辑。\n\n埃尔文一面饮酒，一面淡淡地听着。他和大学生打交道的经验很少。作风精致的私募不像大型投行或咨询公司，隔三差五就要去大学校园里搞宣讲会，巨壁偶尔聘用几个聪明绝顶的应届生，人也几乎没有和埃尔文面对面交流的机会。但场面话埃尔文会说。这女孩儿非常好奇他是怎么毕业就进高盛PIA的，言下之意，好像是想借鉴借鉴他的经验。现实是她没读常春藤，除非在接下来的大学生涯中成功地创个业并顺利地被收购，基本上就是不可能。\n\n埃尔文还没开口，她忽然莞尔一笑：“我怎么老在说这些？好像在networking。”\n\n埃尔文心想，除了这些，他们实在也没什么好聊的。他挑眉：“Networking?”敷衍的时候，重复对方的话就好。\n\n“对呀，现在又不是工作场合，我一直在问你工作的事。”\n\n埃尔文微微一笑：“只要你想，任何时间、任何地点，都可以是工作场合。”\n\n女孩儿神色微僵，脑中似乎闪现了某些可怕的回忆，态度已经有些退却了：“你不工作的时候都干些什么呀？”\n\n抱老婆，但这不关她的事。埃尔文自顾自地侃侃而谈：“也不是谁都能和我聊。你这个年纪，多听听业内人士的想法，才会对行业形成正确的认知。”他目光炯炯地盯着她，“我可以给你讲讲我做的第一个deal。”\n\n女孩儿情不自禁地向后退了一小步，慌乱地四处张望了一会儿，末了对埃尔文说：“我爸好像在叫我，不好意思，我先过去一下。”\n\n埃尔文愉快地点点头：“嗯，快去吧。”\n\n他的拒绝向来巧妙，不是因为他对这些萍水相逢的男男女女心存怜惜，他只是功利地以为，用不着为了和维多利亚斗气，就去得罪人家的父母。\n\n女孩儿开水烫脚似的走了。埃尔文拿起杯中的木签，干脆地吃掉一颗橄榄，朝主屋背面一扇澄净的玻璃窗投去胜利的一眼，再报复性地一口饮尽剩下的酒。他动动手指，身后的侍者便从外套内袋中摸出一只雪亮的银质烟盒，为他抽出一根细长的女士烟，送到他的双唇之间，点燃，他深吸一口，将些许烟灰抖落在花瓣上。\n\n玻璃窗内，是史密斯家富丽堂皇的会客厅，布局和陈设同上世纪英美大户人家的画室相似，是一个供宾主饭后闲聊的地点，正中置了一架气派的斯坦威钢琴，但现在可不兴弹琴唱歌，所以钢琴四周又点缀了几张平易近人的麻将桌。维多利亚嫌太阳大，没出去，和几个老朋友在这儿喝茶、打麻将。看埃尔文几句话就把那女孩儿打发走了，她一点儿不奇怪。实话实说，无论是地产公司二代，还是券商董事之女，配埃尔文都属于攀高枝。他要真把他们看上了，她倒要责怪自己没把儿子教育好。\n\n哎，要说她最为钟意的对象，莫过于罗德·雷斯的两个女儿，可惜大的已经婚配，小的又是个混不吝的，听说正和一个没名堂的纹身师打得火热。早几年也不是没有机会，埃尔文油盐不进，蹉跎了几个门当户对的好对象。\n\n维多利亚耍这些手段，也无非是想表个态：她当利威尔不存在。\n\n维多利亚差人去叫埃尔文，肉眼看着牌面，心眼看着儿子。血缘就是这么奇妙的事，哪怕埃尔文离了她上百米远，她也好像能看见他优哉游哉地吸完了烟，将燃烧的烟蒂掸进身后的花圃里，接过一张湿巾来擦手指，后又将湿巾放在侍者手中一尘不染的银盘子上。回身时，他必会在银盘中检查自己一闪而过的面颜，那绝美的湛蓝的眼眸如荷叶上反光的露珠在云翳下滚动。她抬眼凝望着麻将桌对面墙壁上的巨幅肖像照，和煦的斜阳为画中人依偎般的姿影笼上一层圣洁的光晕，不禁令她柔肠百转，转着转着，还有点热泪盈眶。\n\n相片中，她的模样与现在大同小异，身着一件墨绿丝绸晚礼服，端坐于一张丝绒高背椅上，宛如神女。十四岁的埃尔文站在她身旁，纤长的身体、柔软的五官中蕴含着潜力无限的少年美，他们是一个模子里刻出来的人，就连埃尔文脸上那副略显忧郁的神情，都与少女时代的她有几分相似呢！\n\n埃尔文走进了房间，第一眼也看见了这幅肖像。不是他想看，而是它着实他妈的巨大，只要是个长了眼睛的人，就不会不被它吸引了目光。他走到维多利亚背后，把手搭在椅背上，叫一声：“妈。”\n\n维多利亚也换了便服，穿一件羊绒无袖衫，裸露的肩臂被无比光洁的皮肤包裹，她侧过头，晶莹剔透的侧颜与那张摄于十六年前的照片中别无二致，令埃尔文感受到一种微妙的恐怖。她看向埃尔文，用指腹辨认着麻将的花色：“你打不打？”\n\n三个牌友唉声叹气，意见相当一致：“小文来了，我们还打什么？”\n\n埃尔文笑一声，在维多利亚身后的一张沙发上落座：“别这么说，我妈比我打得好。我看你们打。”\n\n在麻将碰撞的铿锵声中，维多利亚明知故问：“你刚刚在和谁聊天？”\n\n埃尔文报了名字。\n\n“她明天就要回美国了吧？来一趟也不容易，你不和她多聊一会儿？”\n\n埃尔文又笑，有点阴阳怪气了：“你也知道不容易。要不是你叫，人也不会来。何必呢？”\n\n“叫虽然是我叫的，但人家可不是为我来的。她也想干你这行，下回你去纽约出差，可以和她吃个饭，提点提点。”\n\n随便她怎么说。埃尔文低头看手机：“行吧。”\n\n这母子俩每说一句话，就会引起在场牌友的一阵眉飞色舞。虽然从未见过真人，但他们都或隐约或切实地知道埃尔文养了一个小玩意儿。维多利亚肯定是不认可的，不然也不至于这么多年都没给人家一个名分。埃尔文自己也从来不提有这么个人。\n\n利威尔刚给埃尔文发了一张照片，是在某个试衣间里拍的，只看得到下半身。利威尔半跪在全身镜前，光裸的纤细的大腿上缠了一条黑色蕾丝腿环，让他“瑞平一下”。埃尔文还去查了查“瑞平”是什么意思。哦，是“睿智的评论”的简写。\n\n他无需去挖掘那黑与白的鲜明对比中洋溢的张力，或那极度紧张的足弓弧度中充斥的色情，在肖像里母亲的全知之眼下与利威尔聊骚一事本身就具有唯他才能理解的、高浓度的刺激性。那条马蹄踏出的绚丽裂痕再一次打开，他怎么能不目眩神迷？\n\n维多利亚又拉了几句不痛不痒的家常。考虑到埃尔文这次回家表现优异，今年虽不是她的大寿，也送了她一只价值不菲的彩绘玻璃蜻蜓吊灯，除了固执地要戴一对不着调的猫猫头袖扣、在她的花圃上掸烟灰，并没有做出什么让她心肌梗塞的行为，她也像个正常的母亲一样，心中涌动着对儿子的骄傲与喜爱之情。\n\n因此，她无限慈爱地回过头，想再看看那与她一模一样的金发碧眼、深目高鼻——在埃尔文的面容中，真是一点他爸爸的影子都找不到，都是她教得好啊！却发现埃尔文神色凝重地接起了电话，不发一言，不一会儿就捂住麦克风，对她说：“我出去一下。”与此同时，他的另一只手蜷缩了起来，拇指不停地摩挲食指的指节。知子莫若母，这是埃尔文紧张时不经意的小动作。肖像中的埃尔文双手背在身后，那时，他一定也在用拇指摩挲食指的指节吧！\n\n她看埃尔文拿的是私人手机。在他的私生活中，有什么能让他这样子方寸大乱呢？一撮阴暗的火苗在维多利亚心中窜起，并迅速地愈演愈烈。这个不成器的东西！她给一直在一旁待命的秘书打了个眼色，秘书立马过来，弯下腰，听她在耳边低声交代了几句，随后就像一缕幽魂一样消失在转角，去替她打探情况了。\n\n维多利亚看似漫不经心地做牌，心跳愈发激烈。对于悲惨之事，这个女人拥有极度灵敏的嗅觉。今天是她的生日，牌友们给她面子，一张接一张地喂牌。她眼前一列凄惨的青白，可不就是要和的架势。\n\n她这个贴身秘书，业务能力出类拔萃，不到十分钟就回到麻将桌旁，将了解到的信息一五一十地汇报给她。维多利亚越听越喜上眉梢，简直想哈哈大笑，看吧，埃尔文喜欢的人，就是这种货色！\n\n秘书完成了汇报，她也“啪”的一声将麻将推下：“我和了，先不打了。”今年利威尔送了她一份大礼，她叹了口气，柔情蜜意地咬字，“我去看看我的好儿子。”\n\n她在无数条漫长的走廊中寻找埃尔文的身影，仿佛踏进了心灵的迷宫，数度回想起了她在婚姻中受到的屈辱。她花了二十年的时间也想不明白，他为什么会爱上那个女学生？那不过是一个平平无奇的女孩子，戴眼镜，讲话总是慢吞吞的，甚至说不上漂亮。她的容貌、智慧、学识、地位，没有一点比得过她！她就算烧成了一抔灰，也会留下比她光艳上百倍的舍利子！难道就是因为她比她多读了几本普拉斯吗？对于那敏感的、纤细的、幽微的、真挚的，维多利亚一概地恨。她清楚得很，别看埃尔文遗传了她的样貌，心里流的全是敏感纤细幽微真挚的血。如果他不那么像她，她也不会这么爱他。如果他不那么像她，她也不会这么恨他。埃尔文的软弱，就是她亡夫的遗志！埃尔文的软弱，就是对她的背叛！\n\n埃尔文站在一间客房的阳台上，正对一面高耸的植物墙，花园中逐渐消弭的欢声笑语传不到这儿来。听见身后来势汹汹的脚步声，他回过头，脸上残留了一抹寒意，亦有令维多利亚感到亲切的屈辱。那个讨人嫌的秘书跟在她身后，是一名不可或缺的观众。埃尔文是个顶爱面子的人，维多利亚偏要将母子间的窃窃私语公之于众！\n\n话说回来，她还是心疼埃尔文，他们夫妻好歹也曾两情相悦过，埃尔文呢？从头到尾都在单相思。她轻柔地抚摸爱子的面庞，尖利的指甲滑过他的右眼角，那抹如梦似幻的冰蓝，真真是她心目中丑陋和愚蠢的极致。如非出于伟大的母爱，她会毫不犹豫地把那只眼睛挖出来。\n\n骄傲的头颅低垂，她不可一世的爱子，这时显得格外幼小。她幽幽叹息道：“我这么费心教你，你怎么还是变得像我一样？”\n\n \n\n利威尔从甜品店回到家，心情已然天翻地覆。他在佩特拉面前逞强，冷笑着说，就上波尔克家打了个游戏，没想到竟然被拍到，狗仔就会瞎写，以后还是不和明星玩儿了。又说，他和波尔克撞号好不好，他们俩怎么可能？又说，波尔克有喜欢的人。\n\n他在佩特拉面前惜字如金，一下子说了这么多，心里已经慌得不得了了。佩特拉看得出来，握住了他汗湿的手：“利威尔，你是不是很担心？”\n\n他挣了一下，却没有真的把手抽出来：“如果埃尔文信了，他就是个大傻逼。”说得一点信心也没有，埃尔文可不就是个大傻逼吗？\n\n回家路上，佩特拉破例坐在后座陪他。他给埃尔文打了电话，不接，发了微信，不回，试着安慰自己埃尔文或许在应酬在忙，可刚刚他们一直在发消息，一出事就不理人了，不肯定是生气了吗？利威尔浑身一阵又一阵地发冷，小小的一个人，在座位上蜷成一团，看着特别可怜，佩特拉都想跨过去把他抱住。她在公司办公的时间不多，但也有幸见过几次老板发怒时的威仪。那些挨骂的VP，平常哪一个不耀武扬威？哪一个不趾高气昂？让他几句话说得失魂落魄，像刚被阉掉的狗一样……他的办公室三面都是玻璃壁，全公司的人都能把里面的情况看得清清楚楚。感觉他也没做什么过分的事，但他就是能平心静气地把人的脊梁骨一块一块抽走。\n\n佩特拉由此了解到，埃尔文的恐怖，不在于怒气之盛，而在于羞辱性之强。\n\n她在手机上跟踪着事态发展，就他们从店里出来到上车那么一小会儿，她关注的几个营销号已经纷纷删博，“波尔克 恋爱”的热搜下面，也出现了大量粉丝控评。她替利威尔生出一丝希望，说：“你别太担心，老板暂时不接电话，肯定是在处理这些事。”\n\n利威尔一只手扶着脸，虚脱地看她一眼：“我也想相信你。但你也知道吧，不可能的。”如果埃尔文想让他安心，再忙也能抽出时间来给他发一条消息。没发，是因为不想发。\n\n他不久前还在想要和埃尔文好好走下去，在试衣间里撩拨他时因为紧张和害羞而砰砰跳动的心，和现在因为紧张和害怕而疾速蹦跳的，是同一颗心。这个突发事件像一桶冰水把他浇醒：他根本不相信埃尔文。\n\n埃尔文本来说明天才回家，好像是约了律师，要和维多利亚签几个文件。为了避税，他经常把不同公司的股权在母亲和几个心腹之间转来转去，这也没什么稀奇。回到家没多久，利威尔却收到了他的消息：我在路上。\n\n往常会让利威尔雀跃的话，现在只让他感到害怕。如果埃尔文愿意多说一个字，哪怕只是一个字……\n\n他抱着膝盖坐在电梯旁边等人，困顿之中，甚至听不见电梯运行的声响。也想乐观一点吧，最近他们都很好，他问了埃尔文爸爸的事，埃尔文都没有生气。只要埃尔文愿意听他解释，他就会跟埃尔文好好解释。他把波尔克当姐妹，波尔克有喜欢的人，他以后都会把埃尔文的叮嘱放在心上，埃尔文不想他和谁玩儿，他就绝对不和谁玩儿。\n\n——埃尔文轻轻抬起他的下巴，左右看了看，好像在检查自己心爱的物品有没有受到什么损伤。见他毫发无损，便干脆地放开手，默默然往卧室里去了。\n\n利威尔跟着他跑，也跟着他停。他在衣帽间里的全身镜前站定，先脱下了外套。利威尔伸手去接，他便松开了手指，让外套掉在地上。利威尔蹲下身捡，捡起来也不敢抬头，把外套紧紧抱在胸前，咬牙忍住了汹涌的眼泪。他开始解腰带，利威尔做好了捡东西的准备，他却心血来潮似的，换了一只手，把腰带扔在房间的另一边。利威尔艰难地呼吸着，也只能跑过去，把腰带捡起来。\n\n接着，他抬起手腕，一边摘腕表，一边在镜子里看着利威尔，冰蓝的眼眸如同某种结晶体，微微转动了角度，折射出异常冷酷的光芒。他把腕表扔在地上。那一声清脆的“咵哒”，像一记狠辣的耳光。\n\n“利威尔，你真的不给我做脸。”\n\n利威尔认命一般闭上眼，硕大的眼泪，掉在他的衣服上。",

"11\n\n既然佩特拉都得到了消息，埃尔文只可能比她知道得更早。他接到电话时，那长达三天的盛会已接近尾声。\n\n月季盛开的花园中人影如梭。身为唯二主角之一的埃尔文站在一顶如莲叶般硕大的白色遮阳伞下，与某证券公司董事的女儿相谈甚欢。午宴后，他换上一件轻薄的亚麻休闲西装，手持一杯脏马天尼，一副度假的派头。阳伞裙边在风中优雅地飘摆，暗青的橄榄在晕白的酒液中轻轻撞击着杯壁。如果说钻石有千万个切面，此刻光芒四射的，无疑是那格外明快的一面。\n\n女孩儿年纪尚轻，在纽约大学念数学。维多利亚的面子就有那么大，或者说嫁入史密斯家的可能性就有那么吸引人，正值暑假，她匆匆回国，在生日宴上和埃尔文打个照面，次日就要马不停蹄地赶回纽约，好开始在美林证券的暑期实习。与全职运营跑车俱乐部的某地产公司二代相比，她和埃尔文还算有共同语言。\n\n她首先谈了谈自己的职业规划。千篇一律地，打算先干几年IB，再跳槽到PE。这样一来，就拥有了一份亮眼的简历，日后回国，不管是求职还是相亲，她都会有十二分的底气。这话当然是说不出口的——龌龊了，但某些家境优渥的孩子在学校、在职场上下而求索，背后就是这样的逻辑。\n\n埃尔文一面饮酒，一面淡淡地听着。他和大学生打交道的经验很少。作风精致的私募不像大型投行或咨询公司，隔三差五就要去大学校园里搞宣讲会，巨壁偶尔聘用几个聪明绝顶的应届生，人也几乎没有和埃尔文面对面交流的机会。但场面话埃尔文会说。这女孩儿非常好奇他是怎么毕业就进高盛PIA的，言下之意，好像是想借鉴借鉴他的经验。现实是她没读常春藤，除非在接下来的大学生涯中成功地创个业并顺利地被收购，基本上就是不可能。\n\n埃尔文还没开口，她忽然莞尔一笑：“我怎么老在说这些？好像在networking。”\n\n埃尔文心想，除了这些，他们实在也没什么好聊的。他挑眉：“Networking?”敷衍的时候，重复对方的话就好。\n\n“对呀，现在又不是工作场合，我一直在问你工作的事。”\n\n埃尔文微微一笑：“只要你想，任何时间、任何地点，都可以是工作场合。”\n\n女孩儿神色微僵，脑中似乎闪现了某些可怕的回忆，态度已经有些退却了：“你不工作的时候都干些什么呀？”\n\n抱老婆，但这不关她的事。埃尔文自顾自地侃侃而谈：“也不是谁都能和我聊。你这个年纪，多听听业内人士的想法，才会对行业形成正确的认知。”他目光炯炯地盯着她，“我可以给你讲讲我做的第一个deal。”\n\n女孩儿情不自禁地向后退了一小步，慌乱地四处张望了一会儿，末了对埃尔文说：“我爸好像在叫我，不好意思，我先过去一下。”\n\n埃尔文愉快地点点头：“嗯，快去吧。”\n\n他的拒绝向来巧妙，不是因为他对这些萍水相逢的男男女女心存怜惜，他只是功利地以为，用不着为了和维多利亚斗气，就去得罪人家的父母。\n\n女孩儿开水烫脚似的走了。埃尔文拿起杯中的木签，干脆地吃掉一颗橄榄，朝主屋背面一扇澄净的玻璃窗投去胜利的一眼，再报复性地一口饮尽剩下的酒。他动动手指，身后的侍者便从外套内袋中摸出一只雪亮的银质烟盒，为他抽出一根细长的女士烟，送到他的双唇之间，点燃，他深吸一口，将些许烟灰抖落在花瓣上。\n\n玻璃窗内，是史密斯家富丽堂皇的会客厅，布局和陈设同上世纪英美大户人家的画室相似，是一个供宾主饭后闲聊的地点，正中置了一架气派的斯坦威钢琴，但现在可不兴弹琴唱歌，所以钢琴四周又点缀了几张平易近人的麻将桌。维多利亚嫌太阳大，没出去，和几个老朋友在这儿喝茶、打麻将。看埃尔文几句话就把那女孩儿打发走了，她一点儿不奇怪。实话实说，无论是地产公司二代，还是券商董事之女，配埃尔文都属于攀高枝。他要真把他们看上了，她倒要责怪自己没把儿子教育好。\n\n哎，要说她最为钟意的对象，莫过于罗德·雷斯的两个女儿，可惜大的已经婚配，小的又是个混不吝的，听说正和一个没名堂的纹身师打得火热。早几年也不是没有机会，埃尔文油盐不进，蹉跎了几个门当户对的好对象。\n\n维多利亚耍这些手段，也无非是想表个态：她当利威尔不存在。\n\n维多利亚差人去叫埃尔文，肉眼看着牌面，心眼看着儿子。血缘就是这么奇妙的事，哪怕埃尔文离了她上百米远，她也好像能看见他优哉游哉地吸完了烟，将燃烧的烟蒂掸进身后的花圃里，接过一张湿巾来擦手指，后又将湿巾放在侍者手中一尘不染的银盘子上。回身时，他必会在银盘中检查自己一闪而过的面颜，那绝美的湛蓝的眼眸如荷叶上反光的露珠在云翳下滚动。她抬眼凝望着麻将桌对面墙壁上的巨幅肖像照，和煦的斜阳为画中人依偎般的姿影笼上一层圣洁的光晕，不禁令她柔肠百转，转着转着，还有点热泪盈眶。\n\n相片中，她的模样与现在大同小异，身着一件墨绿丝绸晚礼服，端坐于一张丝绒高背椅上，宛如神女。十四岁的埃尔文站在她身旁，纤长的身体、柔软的五官中蕴含着潜力无限的少年美，他们是一个模子里刻出来的人，就连埃尔文脸上那副略显忧郁的神情，都与少女时代的她有几分相似呢！\n\n埃尔文走进了房间，第一眼也看见了这幅肖像。不是他想看，而是它着实他妈的巨大，只要是个长了眼睛的人，就不会不被它吸引了目光。他走到维多利亚背后，把手搭在椅背上，叫一声：“妈。”\n\n维多利亚也换了便服，穿一件羊绒无袖衫，裸露的肩臂被无比光洁的皮肤包裹，她侧过头，晶莹剔透的侧颜与那张摄于十六年前的照片中别无二致，令埃尔文感受到一种微妙的恐怖。她看向埃尔文，用指腹辨认着麻将的花色：“你打不打？”\n\n三个牌友唉声叹气，意见相当一致：“小文来了，我们还打什么？”\n\n埃尔文笑一声，在维多利亚身后的一张沙发上落座：“别这么说，我妈比我打得好。我看你们打。”\n\n在麻将碰撞的铿锵声中，维多利亚明知故问：“你刚刚在和谁聊天？”\n\n埃尔文报了名字。\n\n“她明天就要回美国了吧？来一趟也不容易，你不和她多聊一会儿？”\n\n埃尔文又笑，有点阴阳怪气了：“你也知道不容易。要不是你叫，人也不会来。何必呢？”\n\n“叫虽然是我叫的，但人家可不是为我来的。她也想干你这行，下回你去纽约出差，可以和她吃个饭，提点提点。”\n\n随便她怎么说。埃尔文低头看手机：“行吧。”\n\n这母子俩每说一句话，就会引起在场牌友的一阵眉飞色舞。虽然从未见过真人，但他们都或隐约或切实地知道埃尔文养了一个小玩意儿。维多利亚肯定是不认可的，不然也不至于这么多年都没给人家一个名分。埃尔文自己也从来不提有这么个人。\n\n利威尔刚给埃尔文发了一张照片，是在某个试衣间里拍的，只看得到下半身。利威尔半跪在全身镜前，光裸的纤细的大腿上缠了一条黑色蕾丝腿环，让他“瑞平一下”。埃尔文还去查了查“瑞平”是什么意思。哦，是“睿智的评论”的简写。\n\n他无需去挖掘那黑与白的鲜明对比中洋溢的张力，或那极度紧张的足弓弧度中充斥的色情，在肖像里母亲的全知之眼下与利威尔聊骚一事本身就具有唯他才能理解的、高浓度的刺激性。那条马蹄踏出的绚丽裂痕再一次打开，他怎么能不目眩神迷？\n\n维多利亚又拉了几句不痛不痒的家常。考虑到埃尔文这次回家表现优异，今年虽不是她的大寿，也送了她一只价值不菲的彩绘玻璃蜻蜓吊灯，除了固执地要戴一对不着调的猫猫头袖扣、在她的花圃上掸烟灰，并没有做出什么让她心肌梗塞的行为，她也像个正常的母亲一样，心中涌动着对儿子的骄傲与喜爱之情。\n\n因此，她无限慈爱地回过头，想再看看那与她一模一样的金发碧眼、深目高鼻——在埃尔文的面容中，真是一点他爸爸的影子都找不到，都是她教得好啊！却发现埃尔文神色凝重地接起了电话，不发一言，不一会儿就捂住麦克风，对她说：“我出去一下。”与此同时，他的另一只手蜷缩了起来，拇指不停地摩挲食指的指节。知子莫若母，这是埃尔文紧张时不经意的小动作。肖像中的埃尔文双手背在身后，那时，他一定也在用拇指摩挲食指的指节吧！\n\n她看埃尔文拿的是私人手机。在他的私生活中，有什么能让他这样子方寸大乱呢？一撮阴暗的火苗在维多利亚心中窜起，并迅速地愈演愈烈。这个不成器的东西！她给一直在一旁待命的秘书打了个眼色，秘书立马过来，弯下腰，听她在耳边低声交代了几句，随后就像一缕幽魂一样消失在转角，去替她打探情况了。\n\n维多利亚看似漫不经心地做牌，心跳愈发激烈。对于悲惨之事，这个女人拥有极度灵敏的嗅觉。今天是她的生日，牌友们给她面子，一张接一张地喂牌。她眼前一列凄惨的青白，可不就是要和的架势。\n\n她这个贴身秘书，业务能力出类拔萃，不到十分钟就回到麻将桌旁，将了解到的信息一五一十地汇报给她。维多利亚越听越喜上眉梢，简直想哈哈大笑，看吧，埃尔文喜欢的人，就是这种货色！\n\n秘书完成了汇报，她也“啪”的一声将麻将推下：“我和了，先不打了。”今年利威尔送了她一份大礼，她叹了口气，柔情蜜意地咬字，“我去看看我的好儿子。”\n\n她在无数条漫长的走廊中寻找埃尔文的身影，仿佛踏进了心灵的迷宫，数度回想起了她在婚姻中受到的屈辱。她花了二十年的时间也想不明白，他为什么会爱上那个女学生？那不过是一个平平无奇的女孩子，戴眼镜，讲话总是慢吞吞的，甚至说不上漂亮。她的容貌、智慧、学识、地位，没有一点比得过她！她就算烧成了一抔灰，也会留下比她光艳上百倍的舍利子！难道就是因为她比她多读了几本普拉斯吗？对于那敏感的、纤细的、幽微的、真挚的，维多利亚一概地恨。她清楚得很，别看埃尔文遗传了她的样貌，心里流的全是敏感纤细幽微真挚的血。如果他不那么像她，她也不会这么爱他。如果他不那么像她，她也不会这么恨他。埃尔文的软弱，就是她亡夫的遗志！埃尔文的软弱，就是对她的背叛！\n\n埃尔文站在一间客房的阳台上，正对一面高耸的植物墙，花园中逐渐消弭的欢声笑语传不到这儿来。听见身后来势汹汹的脚步声，他回过头，脸上残留了一抹寒意，亦有令维多利亚感到亲切的屈辱。那个讨人嫌的秘书跟在她身后，是一名不可或缺的观众。埃尔文是个顶爱面子的人，维多利亚偏要将母子间的窃窃私语公之于众！\n\n话说回来，她还是心疼埃尔文，他们夫妻好歹也曾两情相悦过，埃尔文呢？从头到尾都在单相思。她轻柔地抚摸爱子的面庞，尖利的指甲滑过他的右眼角，那抹如梦似幻的冰蓝，真真是她心目中丑陋和愚蠢的极致。如非出于伟大的母爱，她会毫不犹豫地把那只眼睛挖出来。\n\n骄傲的头颅低垂，她不可一世的爱子，这时显得格外幼小。她幽幽叹息道：“我这么费心教你，你怎么还是变得像我一样？”\n\n \n\n利威尔从甜品店回到家，心情已然天翻地覆。他在佩特拉面前逞强，冷笑着说，就上波尔克家打了个游戏，没想到竟然被拍到，狗仔就会瞎写，以后还是不和明星玩儿了。又说，他和波尔克撞号好不好，他们俩怎么可能？又说，波尔克有喜欢的人。\n\n他在佩特拉面前惜字如金，一下子说了这么多，心里已经慌得不得了了。佩特拉看得出来，握住了他汗湿的手：“利威尔，你是不是很担心？”\n\n他挣了一下，却没有真的把手抽出来：“如果埃尔文信了，他就是个大傻逼。”说得一点信心也没有，埃尔文可不就是个大傻逼吗？\n\n回家路上，佩特拉破例坐在后座陪他。他给埃尔文打了电话，不接，发了微信，不回，试着安慰自己埃尔文或许在应酬在忙，可刚刚他们一直在发消息，一出事就不理人了，不肯定是生气了吗？利威尔浑身一阵又一阵地发冷，小小的一个人，在座位上蜷成一团，看着特别可怜，佩特拉都想跨过去把他抱住。她在公司办公的时间不多，但也有幸见过几次老板发怒时的威仪。那些挨骂的VP，平常哪一个不耀武扬威？哪一个不趾高气昂？让他几句话说得失魂落魄，像刚被阉掉的狗一样……他的办公室三面都是玻璃壁，全公司的人都能把里面的情况看得清清楚楚。感觉他也没做什么过分的事，但他就是能平心静气地把人的脊梁骨一块一块抽走。\n\n佩特拉由此了解到，埃尔文的恐怖，不在于怒气之盛，而在于羞辱性之强。\n\n她在手机上跟踪着事态发展，就他们从店里出来到上车那么一小会儿，她关注的几个营销号已经纷纷删博，“波尔克 恋爱”的热搜下面，也出现了大量粉丝控评。她替利威尔生出一丝希望，说：“你别太担心，老板暂时不接电话，肯定是在处理这些事。”\n\n利威尔一只手扶着脸，虚脱地看她一眼：“我也想相信你。但你也知道吧，不可能的。”如果埃尔文想让他安心，再忙也能抽出时间来给他发一条消息。没发，是因为不想发。\n\n他不久前还在想要和埃尔文好好走下去，在试衣间里撩拨他时因为紧张和害羞而砰砰跳动的心，和现在因为紧张和害怕而疾速蹦跳的，是同一颗心。这个突发事件像一桶冰水把他浇醒：他根本不相信埃尔文。\n\n埃尔文本来说明天才回家，好像是约了律师，要和维多利亚签几个文件。为了避税，他经常把不同公司的股权在母亲和几个心腹之间转来转去，这也没什么稀奇。回到家没多久，利威尔却收到了他的消息：我在路上。\n\n往常会让利威尔雀跃的话，现在只让他感到害怕。如果埃尔文愿意多说一个字，哪怕只是一个字……\n\n他抱着膝盖坐在电梯旁边等人，困顿之中，甚至听不见电梯运行的声响。也想乐观一点吧，最近他们都很好，他问了埃尔文爸爸的事，埃尔文都没有生气。只要埃尔文愿意听他解释，他就会跟埃尔文好好解释。他把波尔克当姐妹，波尔克有喜欢的人，他以后都会把埃尔文的叮嘱放在心上，埃尔文不想他和谁玩儿，他就绝对不和谁玩儿。\n\n——埃尔文轻轻抬起他的下巴，左右看了看，好像在检查自己心爱的物品有没有受到什么损伤。见他毫发无损，便干脆地放开手，默默然往卧室里去了。\n\n利威尔跟着他跑，也跟着他停。他在衣帽间里的全身镜前站定，先脱下了外套。利威尔伸手去接，他又松开了手指，让外套掉在地上。利威尔蹲下身捡，捡起来也不敢抬头，把外套紧紧抱在胸前，咬牙忍住了汹涌的眼泪。他开始解腰带，利威尔做好了捡东西的准备，他却心血来潮似的，换了一只手，把腰带扔在房间的另一边。利威尔艰难地呼吸着，也只能跑过去，把腰带捡起来。\n\n接着，他抬起手腕，一边摘腕表，一边在镜子里看着利威尔，冰蓝的眼眸如同某种结晶体，微微转动了角度，折射出异常冷酷的光芒。他把腕表扔在地上。那一声清脆的“咵哒”，像一记狠辣的耳光。\n\n“利威尔，你真的不给我做脸。”\n\n利威尔认命一般闭上眼，硕大的眼泪，掉在他的衣服上。",

{"id": "IKw5Zps03Ay6qY9u7oQpmZqrJgemrxb3GvyhXebxxtQ", "title": "Business-Governance Fit\t", "body": "Author: [Chris Ahn](https://twitter.com/ahnchrisj)\n\nEditor: [Kate Lee](https://twitter.com/katelaurielee)\n\nGraphics: [Tina He](https://twitter.com/fkpxls)\n\n\n---\n\nStartups obsess over how to achieve product-market fit and business model fit, but they rarely discuss business-governance fit. Web3 has brought renewed attention to the formerly overlooked concept that certain governance models are better suited for specific projects.\n\nChoosing the right governance model is straightforward for non-crypto-native projects because the tradeoffs are well known. Even a non-expert can answer whether a project would benefit from being public or private, or for-profit or non-profit. For crypto-native projects, the decision is more complex because they must consider a new axis: decentralization.\n\nDecentralized governance allows anyone to contribute without securing permission from a central authority. Like historical governance parameters, decentralization has distinct tradeoffs. Contrary to common belief, it’s a tool that can benefit some––but not all––web3 projects. Web3 founders should weigh whether their project would benefit from decentralized governance.\n\n## Historical governance models\n\nHistorically, governance decisions were based on two considerations: for-profit vs. non-profit and public vs. private.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/O4m-F2z8n2o3mMbp0O0JK.png?height=1276&width=2284)\n\n* *Public for-profit companies* like Apple have a distributed shareholder base that elects a board of directors by which it is governed.\n* *Private for-profit companies* like Fidelity have a concentrated shareholder base and are typically family owned.\n* *Public non-profit entities* like universities and hospitals are governed by a board in which more than 50% of its directors must be unaffiliated with the organization. In addition, profits cannot be distributed outside of the organization.\n* *Private non-profit entities* like the Gates Foundation usually have a limited number of donors and need not have outside board directors.\n\nThe most notable feature of these historical governance models is that people can only contribute with the proper permissions, typically via employment. Apart from open source projects (which generally do not operate as formal organizations), it’s not possible for someone to simply contribute to a project. To contribute to (aka work for) Apple, Fidelity, a university, or the Gates Foundation, you must first make a serious effort to be trusted by becoming an employee.\n\nWhen MakerDAO decided to hold its [first-ever public MKR vote in 2018](https://blog.makerdao.com/foundation-proposal/), it kicked off an experiment in decentralized governance. Since then, some of the most prominent projects in Web3 have adopted decentralized governance, including [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) ($9.3 billion), [Compound](https://compound.finance/) ($1.2 billion), [Aave](https://aave.com/) ($2.6 billion), [Curve](https://curve.fi/) ($7.3 billion), and [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/) ($4.7 billion). These five projects alone account for over $25 billion in fully diluted market cap (as of April 10, 2022), and many more valuable decentralized projects will emerge.\n\n## The significance of business-governance fit\n\nChoosing the right governance model is a critical decision for founders because the proper fit can act as a strategic advantage. Governance communicates two key signals about an organization:\n\n* ***Intent*.** When a business chooses a governance model, it conveys the objective of the organization. Consider the difference between Facebook Messenger and Signal. Signal’s status as a non-profit strengthens its value proposition as a user-first, privacy-preserving service because it’s clear that it serves no ulterior motive. Many users trust and are loyal to Signal for this reason. Even with feature parity and strong network effects, one dimension on which Facebook Messenger can’t compete with Signal is mission.\n* ***Decision-making.*** Each governance model comes with its own decision-making framework that determines who makes decisions at every level. For example, public organizations ultimately answer to a board of directors that represent a broader constituent base, while private ones answer to their majority owners. The decisions made at board meetings tend to be high-level, and strategic and tactical decisions to execute on high level direction set by the board are left to employees.\n\n## Why decentralize?\n\nDecentralization is a unique governance mechanism because it invites anyone to contribute without permission. So why would an organization want more proverbial cooks in the kitchen when that can slow down and sometimes paralyze it from moving forward? Using the same framework as above, decentralization communicates the following:\n\n* ***Intent*.** It signals the desire for maximum alignment with an organization’s community of users. In historical governance structures, the maximum a user can contribute to a project without becoming an employee is by providing product feedback in designated channels or by voting on specific shareholder resolutions. Because decentralized governance invites anyone to contribute, decentralized projects make a concerted effort to directly involve their communities in what and how they develop.\n* ***Decision-making*.** Decentralized governance hands over decision-making and execution powers to its community at every level. The community decides on which changes to implement by voting on proposals. It can also propose and execute improvements, including detailed product enhancements that would otherwise lie in the hands of employees.\n\nIn many ways, the case for decentralized governance is similar to the case for a public permissionless database (e.g., the blockchain). Although the latter is slower and more costly than its centralized counterpart, there is one aspect—permissionless participation—that is uniquely different, and that unlocks a net new value proposition that wasn’t previously possible.\n\nThe most common criticism of decentralized governance is that more participants mean a less efficient organization. This criticism is undoubtedly true. An organization with five decision makers has 10 possible communication channels, while an organization with 100 decision makers (20x increase) has 4,950 (495x increase). Getting people aligned becomes exponentially more burdensome with more people––hence why in politics, dictatorships make decisions more quickly than democracies, and in business, private companies are more nimble than public ones.\n\nOne way to justify decentralized governance is to answer the question: do organizations that optimize for a diversity of perspectives deserve to compete alongside organizations that optimize for fast decision-making? For those fortunate to live in democracies, the analogy should resonate. Sometimes the axis to optimize for is not speed or cost but fair representation. Doing so can produce results that are far more durable and valuable than projects built for speed alone.\n\n## Choosing decentralized governance\n\nJust as not every for-profit organization aspires to be public, not every web3 project needs to be decentralized. The organizations for which this governance mechanism would represent a strategic advantage are protocols. Protocols are credibly neutral projects that aspire to solve the same needs for its users for as long as possible. Three characteristics of protocols stand out:\n\n1. ***Dependability.*** When products look to leverage protocols, the most important consideration is dependability. Will the protocol credibly serve the purpose I need it to 100 years from now as it does today? Will I have any input into potential changes? For a protocol, choosing decentralized governance shows it intends to be maximally aligned with those who are looking to build products on top of them and provides a direct path for these builders to have a say in the protocol’s development.\n2. ***Small product surface area*.** Protocols are designed to be the lowest-common-denominator abstractions that other products can leverage. As a result, they tend to have small product surface areas. This is desirable for decentralized governance because such decision-making is already complex with only a single product feature; additional product surface area makes decision-making exponentially more complicated.\n3. ***Standardization*.** A successful state for a protocol is to become a standard with network effects. Every incremental product that builds on a protocol makes the value of doing so more compelling for the next one. Decentralized governance helps protocols become standards by providing products with skin in the game to convince others to join.\n\nIt may be controversial, but non-protocol Web3 projects may find decentralized governance unhelpful. As a non-protocol, the project’s objective is growth. Growth occurs by servicing more users and different use cases with additional product functionality. As a result, the product surface area will become larger and eventually unreasonable to govern across many decision makers.\n\n## Towards a Lego block future\n\nChoosing the right governance mechanism is a strategic advantage for any organization, and deciding to decentralize is no different. Today, protocols represent the best type of project to take advantage of the strengths of decentralized governance.\n\nIt’s possible to imagine a world where modular Lego blocks of decentralized protocols built atop one another will exist alongside monolithic apps. This alternative universe will be difficult to create and riddled with failed prototypes. But it’s an exciting experiment in which to participate –– an alternative built for the community, by the community and maximally aligned with the interests of users.\n\n\n---\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d76EydvOc7hyhQSYWS_9w.png?height=766&width=1532)\n\n**The future of work is coming, and we are all its contributors.**\n\n**[Newstand](https://app.station.express/terminal/stationlabs/initiative/3)** is where we begin to define this new world of online collaboration.

We were rushing an overnight to an architectural review board in the Hamptons the night the grand jury declined to indict Daniel Pantaleo for the murder of Eric Garner. Chants thudded down Broadway while I dropped textures into a rendering. By the time I stepped out with the shipment, a protester was reviewing the architecture of a nearby Citibank with a brick.\n\nSix years later, I found myself outside the old Dean & DeLuca again, watching a teenager fashion a bandolier from the charred bumper of a patrol vehicle. The Dean & DeLuca chain—acquired by a Thai property developer a week prior to the Eric Garner protests—had since been stripped down to its franchising fees, the flagship boarded up since the previous fall. On that warm June night, the shuttered legacy luxury brand appeared as an accidental harbinger of the COVID-19 retail apocalypse and the protests now taking hold.\n\nI continued up Broadway with my friends towards the Strand, drawn to the glow of burning scaffolding projected across its face. A few of us pulled ourselves up by the grillwork of Grace Church to survey the thronging crowd. Some other artists came over to say hi. People talked about Occupy. The riot cordon advanced and everyone took off running.\n\nAt work the next morning, I dropped jpegs of my boss’ paintings into a virtual gallery.\n\n![The Strand, New York (May 31, 2020)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/eX-SNax-e9GkNKjYvQzHm.jpg?height=4032&width=3024)\n\nWithin a week of George Floyd’s murder in police custody on May 25, 2020, legacy art institutions had already begun to test the duration and extent of their commitments to the ensuing protests against racialized police violence and the broader Black Lives Matter movement. Due to the lockdowns, much of the moralizing played out online, where social media managers spun noncommittal copy endorsing racial equity into institutional bona fides. In one exceptional example, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art independently circulated works by Glenn Ligon from their collections in contravention of the artist’s own image rights. Until the outcry broke, it seemed to be the rare occasion on which critical art had proven politically effective for someone.\n\nAs one reality unfolded on the internet, quite a different one materialized offline. Amidst the acrid fog of lighter-fluid-fueled trash fires that dotted the Bowery that June, the New Museum stood sheathed in plywood and a thicket of police barricades. The long-running antagonism between art’s discursive commitments and its real material conditions appeared to have broken out into street-to-street fighting.\n\nFor months, art institutions had watched fearfully as their audiences mutated into biological threats, starving them of income. When the threats turned political, the institutions—following the minor history of artists who close exhibition spaces—broke the fourth wall in order to put up a fifth. But the barricades they erected did not merely close their “public” spaces—they enclosed them. Viewed from the street, the barricades revealed the very practices which the walls of the institution normally work to conceal. The stagecraft of protective architecture which had insulated the visitor from the daily maintenance of “autonomous” artworks became the measure of their profane objecthood. Rather than mark and fortify the institutional exterior, the barricades extended and made visible the processes of value production that comprise these institutions’ inner, hidden cores.\n\nSome institutions asserted their authorial tendencies further, as if to emphasize the extent to which substantive reforms had already been foreclosed. SFMOMA commissioned four large posters of dissenting text to be wheatpasted onto the wall it erected, performing a convincing fiction of an institution being held to account by guerrilla tactics; Artists Space battened down, withdrawing Jana Euler’s slug from its façade (its departure marked by two ratchet straps in place of the customary trail of slime); the New Museum camouflaged as a construction site behind hunter green fencing. Not even the defacement of the temporary structure was left to chance.\n\n![San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, July 7, 2020](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uhBVT2r4eQ-IKt73MrVN9.jpg?height=2475&width=3675)\n\nWhile the observations in this essay developed from my own experiences in New York and San Francisco, the antagonisms they describe are a microcosm of much greater transformations currently underway. In the United States in particular, the failure of the legacy art world to maintain some purchase on the popular imagination is an epiphenomenon of the failure of its institutions to promote objectives beyond their immediate self-interest. As institutions have absorbed ever greater amounts of private wealth, this self-interest has increasingly identified with the larger plutocracy in which it is embedded.\n\nUnder neoliberalism, the infrastructure that developed to support the twentieth-century art world—museums, galleries, schools, publications, discourses—came to form the horizon of artistic production. From the professional mandate of graduate degree work to the instrumentalization of art as popular entertainment, legacy art institutions strategically realigned themselves in order to buttress and improve their position as gatekeepers. Though art institutions have expended substantial resources to cultivate an aura of legitimacy and permanence, the external crises they faced in 2020 remind us that the institutions themselves are not quite so determinative as the cult of money in which they are enmeshed. If the narrative of the past 20 years is the disarticulation of price from cultural value, the narrative of the past 20 months is the revelation that price is the only common measure of cultural value we have left.\n\nThe artist’s essay typically renovates a cultural project dredged from art history. But it is art history’s own shibboleths that the new value configurations call into question. With the auction house dominance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the art world sees itself transcended by a new “populist” bubble, which finally abandons the myth that the art market has some originary foundation in the cultural value that the art world’s gatekeepers assign. These new valuations are produced externally, in other non-art parts of the culture ecosystem, where—as with the populism of contemporary politics—the lines between authentic engagement and plutocratic astroturfing are purposely blurred. With the triumph of money as the final arbiter, the Faustian bargain of the art world comes due: institutions must either yield and reorient themselves or lose their power as gatekeepers.\n\n### Enclo­sures\n\nAs asset prices boomed in the decade following the 2007–2008 financial crisis, a spate of building projects swept New York’s major art institutions: the Whitney in 2015 ($422 million for the Gansevoort building), the Museum of Modern Art in 2019 (a $450 million expansion of its main campus), and the Met throughout the later 2010s (including a $13 million renovation of the Met Breuer, an $18 million renovation of its British decorative arts galleries, and a $150 million skylight replacement, with a $70 million renovation of its Rockefeller Wing and a $600 million renovation of its Modern Wing still to come). But capital campaigns organized around renovations and new construction fail to provide for the costs of operating those same infrastructures during downturns. The New Museum’s hunter green cladding should have heralded the groundbreaking of its own $63 million expansion, announced amidst hostile contract negotiations in the summer of 2019. As the COVID-19 pandemic darkened the outlook for the museum’s planned expansion, management gutted the nascent union, leaving only a quarter of its 84 members on payroll.\n\nWith the primary economic engines of the art world in retreat in 2020, many legacy institutions hurdled towards deleveraging events. By August, the Brookings Institution estimated that 1.4 million jobs had been lost in the fine and performing arts, echoing a July survey by the American Alliance of Museums, which reported that one-third of U.S. museums may permanently close as a result of the pandemic. After months of lost revenue and the exhaustion of bailout funds, some institutions unevenly distributed their hardships, cutting “non-essential” staff and programming. Others renegotiated their primary responsibilities, further eroding their public commitments. When all else failed, they shuttered. In each instance, the arc bent towards privatization.\n\nIf the enduring impact of the pandemic is the end of middles—mid-size businesses, mid-size incomes, mid-size institutions and galleries (e.g., Gavin Brown’s enterprise and Metro Pictures)—the K-shaped flight to extremes portends less diversity and less volume in the legacy art world to come. With fewer funds to allocate towards research, loans, and new acquisitions, legacy art institutions will increasingly follow the example of the 2008 recession, when more than three-quarters of exhibitions derived from museums’ own permanent collections. In some instances, culture war dynamics have been operationalized as cover for these changes. The announcement postponing *Philip Guston Now* first suggested that additional time was needed to recontextualize the artist’s depictions of robed Klansmen; only later did an institutional representative concede that [“logistical challenges and the cost of shipping works during the pandemic also figured in the plan to delay the show.”](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/philip-guston-retrospective-delayed-kkk-imagery-1234571680/)\n\nMuseums have similarly dissembled on the matter of deaccessioning, after the American Association of Art Museum Directors suspended many of its restrictions in April 2020. The arguments against deaccessioning are by no means settled, especially since many collections constitutively exclude women artists and artists of color. But there should be no mistake: deaccessioning marks the final collapse of the institutional silo. The outflow of objects from the notionally public trust into the distributed warehouses of the ultra-rich repeats the enclosure of the barricades, materially undermining the rhetoric of diversity and equity initiatives.\n\nIndeed, the bulk of institutional creativity in the legacy art world now seems to be directed towards contriving novel ways to profit from existing assets. During the 2008 financial crisis, the Art Institute of Chicago partitioned its debt-burdened school away from the museum’s comparatively healthy balance sheets, forcing the school to sell its portfolio of properties in order to stay afloat. The school in turn collateralized its debts by increasing its enrollment of foreign students ineligible for financial aid. During the pandemic, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago has doubled down on this recession-era gamble, introducing rotating shift schedules to staff a virtual shadow school for students in East Asia. When money becomes the measure of cultural value, it also becomes the index of institutional authority. In this context, the harried race to recapitalize appears less a matter of fiscal responsibility than an effort to shore up cultural influence in a period of institutional decline.\n\n### Constructions\n\nWhile legacy art institutions foundered during the pandemic, those in a position to buy up devalued assets quickly achieved tremendous returns on investment. Like the bursting of the housing bubble in 2007–2008, the February–March 2020 stock market crash precipitated massive new concentrations of wealth. Though crises objectively restructure markets, repricing assets to equilibrium values, their distributional effects are often biased: in the 10 months between March 18, 2020, and January 18, 2021, the combined wealth of the United States’ 660 billionaires increased by 38.6 percent, to $4.1 trillion. For those who benefited, it quickly became exigent to offset taxes on new gains. Family art foundations, for instance, function as tax-advantaged investment vehicles which allow families to “borrow” works for display in their own homes. Take it from the curator at one such foundation, who reported, “The last time we bought work like this was 2008.” In the same moment that the pandemic has highlighted the unsustainability of the art world for producers—debt-fueled education, precarious labor conditions, extreme income inequality—it likewise demonstrates how “essential” the art world’s luxury economy is for consumers, who continue to seek high-return investments and tax shelters as a new era of Fed-subsidized money and near-zero interest rates dawns.\n\nThis essential function was not lost on Pace, Hauser & Wirth, or Sotheby’s, who all decamped to satellite locations in the Hamptons during the summer of 2020, followed closely by a slew of secondary-market dealers. On the opening of Pace East Hampton, Pace’s founder commented, [“The collectors are here, and the work has to be seen.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/arts/design/eastward-ho-even-art-is-leaving-for-the-hamptons.html) For all the apparent happenstance, however, the relocations provided useful prototypes for future ventures. Heavyweights, such as Pace and Sotheby’s, and mid-size galleries, such as Mitchell-Innes & Nash and Paula Cooper, all inked short-term leases in Florida for winter 2021, citing the success of the East Hampton ventures: [“They would come in in golf outfits and bathing suits and flip-flops, so it was much less formal, and there was more dialogue about art objects.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/arts/design/pace-acquavella-sothebys-palm-beach.html)\n\nThe much-speculated demise of the art fair gives way to an even more exclusive viewing experience, a traveling circus of mega-galleries chasing ultra-rich patrons from gilded enclave to gilded enclave. Far from the prying eyes of art critics, galleries import their most decorative stock—the press text for the inaugural show at Paula Cooper South advertised how the works celebrated “the vibrant life of Palm Beach and the surrounding area” (43 billionaires/7.8 square miles). With sales volume booming, the gallery has since committed to a permanent Florida expansion. Elsewhere, a new crop of pop-ups greeted the vibrant Aspen summer (75 billionaires/3.5 square miles). The proximity of these galleries’ flagship locations to a broader public seems purely accidental in retrospect (Manhattan: 105 billionaires/22.8 square miles).\n\nAs mega-galleries move their inventory closer and closer to collectors’ homes, they begin to resemble Amazon in more than just their monopolistic tendencies. Seen alongside the barricades, these last-mile warehouses underscore an old truth in a new way: the reality of the exhibition venue as logistics hub, a dry port for goods to rest as they transit between networks, increasingly striking the more the other aspects of the institution disappear. This reality shows when legacy art institutions represent themselves not as the privileged spaces they stake out in their mission statements but as sites that must be defended against riots and other forms of circulation struggle. It shows when mega-galleries depart their roosts, when museums deaccession works—when the motive to simply move product gives the lie to curation and criticism. The fortification of the institution proves to be the architectural corollary to the loss of its physical interface, the becoming-distribution-center of everything.\n\n### Renovations\n\nIn its uneven distribution of effects, the pandemic brings into focus a world riven into enclaves, renewing the pressure of geographic arbitrage on the art world’s urban strongholds. The dissolution of the “urban core” is really the dissolution of a certain vision of urbanization, built around a tranche of capital-intensive sectors and the massive service industries they support.\n\nFor the legacy art world, these crises are not merely economic but ontological. [The barricades that institutions erected in the summer of 2020 defended them against an enemy they had conjured from history](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/arts/design/met-museum-staff-letter-racism.html); in reality, there were no Communards clamoring to set fire to their storehouses. The declining relevance of the legacy institution is pictured less by an image of the Louvre burning than by an image of Andy Goldsworthy’s *Spire* reviewed by an errant flame in San Francisco’s Presidio that June. At a board meeting of the Presidio Trust the following month, its CEO reported, “We have no evidence that this \\[fire\\] was deliberately set … Clearly it was caused by human causes …, but our best guess is that it was caused due to an illegal encampment near the *Spire*.” Art, here, appears as the casualty of a larger social crisis in which it is powerless to intervene.\n\n![Andy Goldsworthy, Spire (2008, burned 2020)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/trZONQlwpIJ04jMmdQmJN.jpg?height=1350&width=1350)\n\nOnce the central nodes of the dispersed networks of the art world, legacy art institutions counted on the strength of their influence to reap the rewards of new cultural practices while artists hazarded the risk. As the creep of money flattened the legacy art world, the undertakings of independent cultural producers offered a ready source of cultural value that these institutions could appropriate back to themselves as needed. To an extent, this was by design—even artist-run institutions, which flourished in the past 20 years with the advent of cheap digital publishing and distribution, ultimately aspired to be absorbed and rewarded by the institutional ecosystem which they mirrored. With the recent turn towards austerity among many legacy institutions, these flows have stagnated. Conduits for the uptake of emerging artists and ideas have dwindled. Meanwhile, diminished institutional carrying capacity has intensified competition among artists already circulating through the mainstream.\n\nAs these feedback effects compound, the gravitational pull of the legacy institution progressively wanes. In its stead, the ascendant Patreon-Substack-OnlyFans regime of paywalled content production generalizes Beeple’s outsider entrepreneurialism, establishing an extra-institutional market to determine the price of every individual “creator.” Compensation is collectivized, but only in the most precarious ways. Without the narrative infrastructure and hypertext that robust and broad-based institutions promise, new practices will fail to cohere into cultural projects that can be taken up by others.\n\n![San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (August 3, 2020)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qvceRaAWe53_PziHag6Md.jpg?height=2475&width=3675)\n\nWhen I passed SFMOMA again in August 2020, the barricades had regressed from their figurative political agitations into so many Suprematist elements. The wheatpasted posters, which purported to affirm a revolution-in-progress, had ceded to a new institutional realism. Trading the projection of progressive values for blank plywood walls, the museum acknowledged the primacy of its material conditions over its position as a cultural platform. As Kazimir Malevich wrote in his 1915 text, *From Cubism and Futurism to Suprematism: The New Painterly Realism*, “The efforts of the art authorities to direct art along the path of common sense annulled creation.” Reduced to its bare compositional elements, the legacy art institution prompts us to ask: how could the art world be made differently?\n\nBeyond the barricades, the budget constrictions, and the Florida gallery outposts, which feverishly seek to extract new profits from old forms of cultural value, new institutional projects have begun to proffer answers. On the forefront of such changes are the plethora of dark forest communities (on- and offline social networks that congregate below and outside of Web 2.0 social media) that have taken root during the pandemic, such as New Models (spearheaded by Caroline Busta, Lil Internet, and Daniel Keller) and the forthcoming decentralized media organization Channel, of which New Models forms a part. Embedded in the emergent project of web3—the dream of a decentralized web built around crypto tokens, of which digital art NFTs are only the opening volley—these communities are already practically influencing the ways in which culture is funded, produced, and distributed. Like a bloom of mycelia, these new institutional projects have flourished amidst decay, proposing new forms of curation and collective ownership as legacy art institutions continue to unravel. Though legacy institutions have finally begun to formulate the question—as evidenced by a host of a recent programming, including “Speculative Values: Between the Institution and the NFT” (the New Museum), “NFTs and the Museum” (the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), “NFTs: Fad or the Future of Art?” (the Smithsonian’s Hirshhorn Museum), “NFT Mania: The Future of Art or Venture-Backed Experiment?” (the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco), and “NFTs The Next 500 Years” (Pérez Art Museum Miami)—it has become increasingly clear that the answer consists in their transcendence.\n\n*An earlier version of this essay was published on June 11, 2021 by the journal Forty-Five.*", "timestamp": 1653392271, "digest": "Sy98v89nmQGirCCAQKatom_Za-VBlelKuWEYwMeASCc", "contributor": "0xE4B2d0Fb698dB5a0a23c4AB740303706d036044e"}

Take a random sampling of Twitter bios of DAO contributors, and you’ll find between 3-5 communities listed. While this might seem to indicate a lack of focus, we scientists know better. In fact, there are decades of research on how knowledge workers in a decentralized network become “optimally distinct.”\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vZbaLsaueInLyxbBD6kvh.png?height=598&width=1470)\n\nOptimal distinctiveness is the theory that layering multiple affiliations into one identity can be predicted both mathematically and intuitively; in essence, humans are always balancing the need for inclusion and the need for differentiation. The polyamorous work (or “polywork”) enabled by web3 isn’t a random deviation from the standard “one job from 9-5” of web2 — it’s a logical step forward in the increasingly competitive labor market for knowledge workers. **Employers may want people to work for them full time, but employees left to their own devices and in a more competitive market will actually *prefer* to work among multiple communities.**\n\nMy claim that the rise of digitally native work will make us all behave like scientists comes from personal experience. I’ve been able to explore digitally native communities from many different angles. I was a laboratory neuroscientist myself; helped build ResearchGate, the primary platform where scientists connect; and recently founded Backdrop, a platform that leverages tokens and other web3 infrastructure to make participating in communities easier and more fun. I left science for web3 because I believe we’re building a foundation that will finally allow distributed communities like academia to capture a higher proportion of the value they create. And I love talking to people currently working in web3 because they sound so much like scientists, especially the layered way they think about building their identity. \n\n## Optimal distinctiveness, or “I am my niche”\n\nDr. Marilynn Brewer, a psychologist who has [spent her career studying](https://psychology.osu.edu/people/brewer.64) “how our identities are shaped by our group membership,” first wrote about the theory of optimal distinctiveness in 1991. It’s beautiful because it can span a [50-page paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241065845_Optimal_Distinctiveness_Theory) and also be neatly summarized in one sentence:\n\n> *“Individuals have two fundamental and competing human needs — the need for inclusion and the need for differentiation — that can be met by membership in moderately inclusive (optimally distinct) groups.”*\n\nThe desire to be in optimally distinct social groups –– to survive and cooperate –– is fundamental to human nature. It explains why we are happy when we feel a true sense of belonging in communities we care about, and why left-handed people are [more likely to form deeper social connections](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241065845_Optimal_Distinctiveness_Theory) than those who are right-handed (“right-handed people” as a community isn’t sufficiently differentiated).\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RwPsHkbXnLdab9THSem3V.png?height=810&width=1442)\n\nIn science, optimal distinctiveness is the sweet spot between working in a desireable field while not getting “scooped” by another scientist who publishes your work before you do. At ResearchGate, our research showed that scientists define their research focus via \\~3-5 overlapping topics, such as “CRISPR | CYSTIC FIBROSIS | FRUIT FLY” or “REGENERATION | MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS | MOUSE” (my niche when I was in the lab). Three to five topics seems to be “optimally distinct” for most academics.\n\nI would expect that the 3-5 average remains true in web3, and although the Venn diagrams look different — perhaps it’s “NFT | LAWYER | MUSIC” — the logic is the same. Simultaneously contributing to NFT, legal, and music DAOs doesn’t make someone unfocused –– it makes them unique.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SUmKrFRuErb3PtTrdwcxK.png?height=752&width=1480)\n\nThere is one exception to the 3-5 community rule in science, and it’s the same as in web3: founders and core contributors. If you create a successful community or invent a technique or field of study, you can be optimally distinct without layering on additional affiliations. This dichotomy presents a UX risk for DAO tools: we design for the founders who aren’t as interested in polywork but do gatekeep the community in some ways, despite the fact that the majority of contributors will need to manage multiple simultaneous affiliations. \n\n## UX lessons from COVID science\n\nWhat happens when you don’t design for overlapping communities? The products built for the scientific COVID community are an illustrative example. \n\nMany scientific organizations responded to COVID by doing whatever they could to help scientists who were researching vaccines and treatments. In the early days of the pandemic, scientists couldn’t keep up with the amount of information being published, for three reasons:\n\n1. Volume: As the entire scientific world turned its eyes to COVID, the rate of publications about coronaviruses skyrocketed in a matter of weeks. [Some studies](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.111294v1.full) estimate it to have been \\~100x the rate prior to the start of the pandemic. \n2. Quality: In addition to the increase in quantity, there were proportionally more low-quality publications because most bypassed the traditionally slow peer-review process and were published on preprint servers (where anyone can publish).\n3. Breakdown of existing discovery and aggregation tools: Many of the tools scientists use to stay up to date took time to react to the rapid shift to preprints. For example, the two main scientific search engines, Google Scholar and Pubmed, didn’t index most of them.\n\nIn response, many organizations built tools to aggregate and curate preprints and publications about COVID. We built a COVID community on ResearchGate that was like a Subreddit connected to a fairly exhaustive database of publications, and there were similar efforts from institutions like Johns Hopkins and companies like Semantic Scholar. We weren’t thinking about long-term UX; we were just trying to help the scientists on the front lines. \n\nWorking on those solutions was hugely motivating, and they helped plug the holes in the early days, but most of them have since been removed or folded back into the products from which they came. (We sunset the COVID community just before I left ResearchGate.) The reason those products didn’t last is simple: COVID isn’t a bucket that neatly contains the scientists in it –– it’s just one cloud in the sky of overlapping topics in science.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/q4Ig1IPyNmRFWZRXUAsGz.png?height=988&width=1534)\n\nLet’s say you’re a mathematician who studies the spread of contagious diseases in developing countries. You jumped into COVID research and started occupying the niche of “COVID | MATH | EPIDEMIOLOGY | DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,” where you are optimally distinct. You need to stay current on COVID publications about math, but you also need to monitor math journals and epidemiology publications about other infectious diseases. Only presenting COVID publications to a community focused on discovery is incomplete. But it’s not as simple as adding math and epidemiology, because Sarah’s niche may be “COVID | EPIDEMIOLOGY | MOUSE MODELS” –– so she needs publications on mouse models for other infectious diseases. In other words, a product that treats the community like a bucket will be optimized for nobody. \n\n## Why Twitter –– and not Discord –– is winning web3\n\nThe simple solution to this UX problem is the internet's most powerful tool: a network. In a network, I can build my optimally distinctive niche while Sarah builds hers in the same place. Hence why Twitter is still the most important platform for web3: because people are able to more fluidly manage their own interest graph, Twitter becomes a single destination to which you go to stay up to date and connect with everything and everyone you care about.\n\nBy contrast, Discord conceives of communities as buckets or walled gardens, with little ability to move between them. There are moments when you can feel like a cloud trying to be confined to a bucket –– like when you can’t create a shared chat between people across servers, or when you want to co-host an event with another community, or even when you have to toggle between servers to play whack-a-notification while you’re trying to get work done. \n\nHowever, it’s not black and white. There are features in Discord that do account for the cloudlike nature of online communities –– for example, having one DM for someone across all servers, or seeing which servers you share with someone on their profile. I’m also not discounting the importance of more bucket-like tools like Discord for building deeper connections within a single community. But as work moves toward polyamory, especially with interoperable data enabled by web3, there’s a huge opportunity to build experiences that facilitate interactions at the overlaps between communities.\n\n## Why polywork will succeed \n\nResearch like optimal distinctiveness accurately positions DAOs and the ease of polywork they enable as just one response to a trend that exists independently of crypto. The rise of side hustles and the emergence of polywork in DAOs are part of the same macro-trend.\n\nThe critique of DAOs that holds that the polyamorous way of working won’t get anything done shouldn’t be about crypto; it should be a higher-level argument about whether side hustles will slow or disappear. That discussion is a lot more interesting and harder to bulldoze with simplistic comments like “BLOCKCHAINS ARE EXPENSIVE.”\n\nBased on my research as an academic and my experience building products, the only way I see the trend towards polywork slowing is if the global talent market gets less competitive. But I can’t imagine that happening given the new dynamics introduced by remote work. And as work shifts towards employee preferences, I would expect that the same 3-5 affiliations we’ve seen in science stay true for other knowledge workers. People will often have primary affiliations where they can focus and side hustles where they can explore, but multiple simultaneous projects will be the norm.\n\nWhen I think about placing bets for myself and for Backdrop, it’s that the landscape of workers is going to shift more toward clouds and away from buckets. That’s a good thing because it represents a shift toward putting power in the hands of individuals more equitably. Polywork gives people the freedom to move and fluidly definite their identity, and to explore and derisk their next step while keeping at least one foot on solid ground. It’s a natural evolution in the ever-more-competitive talent market, and helping people access and combine the clouds of their lives will be increasingly important for builders to consider. \n\n\n---\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XzIHM5GKKIhsHTDvEdWND.png?height=1080&width=1920)\n\n**The future of work is coming, and we are all its contributors.**\n\n**[Newstand](https://app.station.express/terminal/stationlabs/initiative/3)** is where we begin to define this new world of online collaboration.

{"id": "fQs6LjJduRvHtfO9JaQUSN5oYjKhQllT_Mitc-vwwCU", "title": "Disciples' Economic Forum", "body": "## The Vision and Mission of the DEF\n\nHow might we, as followers of Christ, reshape the systems of the world to be subsumed by and exist within His Kingdom? The command to “love God and love your neighbor” empowers us to spread God's blessing and fulfill the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations. The world of web3 and the “cryptocosm” enables His disciples to leverage new tools, rules, and team structures to alleviate the physical, moral, and spiritual bankruptcy which pervades society. \n\nThis Disciples’ Economic Forum (DEF) will provide a space to educate each other, evangelize the broader community, and empower followers of Christ to build for His Kingdom on earth. The core function of the group will be to promote positive public dialog and encourage engagement by rewarding meaningful contribution and developing a network. Tactically, the DEF will take the form of a short (one page maximum) weekly article which explores the confluence of economics, history, institutional or systemic change, and faith. Each of these articles will end with a prompt or “call to action”, which will be posted to Twitter as a free “hook” to engage more people and encourage them to subscribe to the weekly articles.\n\n## Operations of the DEF\n\n### A primer on the Growth Flywheel\n\nThe network growth model of the DEF is based on the Product-led Growth Flywheel from [productled.org](https://www.productled.org/foundations/the-product-led-growth-flywheel). This model shown below demonstrates how new users evaluating a product will Activate as Beginners, those Beginners then make the decision to Adopt to become Regulars, the Regulars soon learn to Adore the product to become Champions, and product Champions will Advocate a product to encourage new Evaluators to Activate, and the cycle repeats. In this way a new product can achieve exponential growth in its user and customer base.\n\n![Figure 1: PLG Flywheel](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/apNYxzHhqZ1pDf9X_KvcQ.jpg?height=1084&width=1580)\n\n### The DEF Operations Flywheel\n\nThe model for this forum will be to use Twitter as a free resource to engage and activate new users with thoughtful prompts, encourage those new users to subscribe to the publication on Mirror.xyz to access weekly articles and resources, create a sense of ownership by selling articles and artifacts as NFTs, and incentivize healthy and sustainable network growth by [sharing subscription revenue with NFT owners](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide).\n\n![Figure 2: DEF Flywheel](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Wab8Yg4mPPHqRlfm6WbF2.jpg?height=1340&width=1678)\n\nTwitter will be used to encourage free, open, and limited engagement and maximize exposure. Mirror.xyz provides a platform for users to subscribe to longer-form articles (one page maximum), and the subscription paywall encourages meaningful and positive contributions. Mirror.xyz also provides a model to turn artifacts such as articles into a purchasable NFT which gives owners a stake in the forum’s success, and the interplay between the free Twitter, subscription-based articles, and ownership-based NFTs is meant to create sustainable product growth.\n\n### DEF Revenue Sharing Model\n\nThere are 4 personas involved in revenue:\n\n1. **Creative Team Members**: write and post articles, edit content, and manage the Mirror.xyz and Twitter feeds\n2. **NFT Owners**: purchase artifacts minted as NFTs and maintain a share of subscription profits\n3. **Subscribers**: pay subscription fees on mirror.xyz in order to access articles and artifacts\n4. **General Users**: Engage with prompts posted to Twitter, but have no access to Mirror.xyz articles until they subscribe on the platform\n\nThere are two sources of revenue- subscription fees which are shared by all NFT Owners to incentivize growth of the DEF, and NFT sales which are distributed amongst the Creative Team Members to compensate for maintaining the DEF.\n\n## DEF Kickoff Roadmap\n\nThe DEF Creative Team Members will have much to learn and many trials and errors as we release this product, and there are aspects which will need to change. A full release roadmap is in development, and as that is being built our team will focus on the following tasks for a launch:\n\n![Figure 3: DEF Kickoff Roadmap](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OHuf6jGXlWR5RCuBL6DxK.png?height=550&width=937)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Where will these articles and prompts be released?** Articles will be posted on the Johannes Talbotus Mirror.xyz site: <url tbd>. Prompts will be posted on the Johannes Talbotut Twitter: https://twitter.com/j_talbotus\n\n**How many people will engage initially?**\n\nInitial engagement will be understandably low. In order to address that, the access to articles on Mirror.xyz will be free for a limited time to build a network and an active following.\n\n**When will the first article and prompt be shared?**\n\nThe MVP for release will be articles on Mirror.xyz and posted Twitter prompts, which will be launched in May. At that time, the full monetization and revenue sharing model will not be in place. The subscriptions, NFT sales, and revenue sharing will follow in the future.\n\n**How often will articles and prompts be released?**\n\nThe initial plan is for a weekly release of one article on Mirror.xyz, followed immediately by the posting of a prompt to Twitter. Articles and prompts will be released Mondays, with future NFT sales happening later in the week.\n\n**Why introduce payments and not keep this free?**\n\nCo-founder of Netscape and investment firm Andreessen-Horowitz, Marc Andreessen claims “the original sin of the internet was not including a payment option in the browser”. This means that all revenue is generated by advertising, and therefore incentivizes maximum engagement at all costs. This model has led naturally to incentivizing and promoting negative behavior, as anger and fear have proven to drive engagement. Our hypothesis is that basing revenue on subscription and a “stake in the game” will incentivize positive and meaningful engagement instead of trolling and negative interactions.\n\n**How will revenue sharing be structured?**\n\nThis will be tested and optimized through the early release. The initial model will be for all NFT sales revenue to be split amongst the DEF Creative Team Members, and for all subscription revenue to be split evenly with NFT Owners. This means that for each new NFT release, the previous owners’ stake will be diluted. This will encourage owners to counteract that dilution by either encouraging more subscribers to increase the revenue they share, or by purchasing another NFT artifact to increase their stake in the shared revenue.\n\n**What is the long term goal of the DEF?**\n\nThe DEF will be a place for Christians who want to build in Web3 to connect, learn from others, and engage the broader community. It will remain in place as long as it proves helpful and effective. This project is also an experiment to test an ownership-based model of content creation and engagement.\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1653396301, "digest": "YWBEttcK5RkMwGMMXcOGIRjUiJAY-IE1r0WmtR9-W6U", "contributor": "0xcbA4f2aC821B86984dF7Bda415bE7690B9043C8c"}

In exchange, those services for users are cheaper and, in many cases, free. Data provides these services the feedback loop needed to make these products better and more personalized. Instead of waiting for user feedback reactively, systems capture user behaviors proactively to provide a better service, performance, and experience.\n\nIn web3, the promise is that a user can retain ownership and control over their data. The dominant narrative goes: “The gatekeepers of web2 have taken your data and used it against you! Now it’s time to fight back!” Such argument from web3 enthusiasts is met with A LOT of resistance as data effectively becomes a currency that can be leveraged by a user for select experiences. This, deservingly, is hit with two main provocations —\n\n1. Data is worth a lot less than you think\n2. The network effect of data can only be achieved at scale\n\nBeyond the web3 sentiment of data becoming valuable, this push often coincides with the belief that not only should data now be strictly in one's control and unlock utility, but it should also be something worth getting paid for. This hits our existing experiences and internet evolution head-on — if we exchange data for the services we get to enjoy today, forfeiting that can impact experiences, programming, and influencing what you as a user may find interesting. It can make products more expensive. It can slow the pace and evolution of existing products. And more so, it chops the legs of distribution, which while being explored by way of tokens, is nowhere near compatible with top-of-funnel mechanisms today.  **So knowing this, what role does data play in the new web3 ecosystem that can not only reroute its value but also drive the promise and mechanics of decentralized, community-owned networks?**\n\n> *Oftentimes the best way to solve a problem is to do it indirectly. To earn more value is likely not a linear path. In this case, web3 data may not be compensated. But it will be accredited.*\n\nWeb3 has the opportunity to build systems that are less about what you say and more about what you do. When users interact with Web3 apps, the act of signing or approving a transaction becomes much more intentional. Data becomes a core part of the users’ relationship with the platform, versus the platform’s relationship with the user. This changes the role of how data is used and collected, thus changing the way it will also be valued. Through this lens, the incentives for data in web3 are being actively experimented with throughout the entire ecosystem in various pockets of Defi, DAOs, NFTs & other acronyms. For example, on RabbitHole, data accrued can be used to reflect your skills throughout web3 for both professional and personal gains.  While we should encourage all research, including the ability to transact, the one that gets me most excited is how incentives can accumulate to an individual’s online reputation. In this scenario, the value isn’t about data captured by platforms but data earned by individuals.\n\n[In 2018, I wrote about what this decentralized reputation could look like in the form of a creator.](https://www.tokendaily.co/blog/reputation-in-web-3) While the piece looked at how the media business should evolve based on this transition, the sentiment of the creator, contributor, or participant all are the same —\n\n> *“Currently, there have been platforms that enable coordination and allocation of intrinsic or extrinsic “capital” to achieve a shared goal. With blockchain-based networks, we want to incentivize participants towards some predictable outcome that is beneficial for every network participant. It’s not just about the group, but also about the network participent themself.*\n>\n> *“What’s most exciting about this next era of permissionless innovation is that it’s no longer dependent on a central authority. It’s not dependent on the host, network, publisher or platform. This era of reputation is not built and dictated by a set standard of link share clubs or opaque algorithms. It’s adjustable, adaptable, managed and maintained by your preferences. We no longer need to be strictly driven by how a single platform categorizes, aggregates, and rewards. We can rely on each other to index this information now in a way that benefits all of the participants.”*\n\nThree years later, we still aren’t there ***yet*** but we are definitely edging closer. Protocols are being built to ingest this information and the platform is being used to display it for use.  Spending the last few years trying to more deeply understand how data plays in this space will lead to more products, protocols, and outcomes of how this new world will unfold. One result is how we are now seeing an individual’s desire for data being used as a motivator. The more you do, the more you earn. Your contributions both positive and negative are reflected in your behaviors, thereby creating a clearer picture of who you and others are on the web. Some early versions of this can be seen through airdrops, which reward users based on some algorithm that tracks contribution history. In order to build long-term sustainable incentive systems, the reward mechanism needs to evolve much further.\n\nInstead of just looking at data as a way to transact, it starts to become a function of validation and reputation whereas the individual is able to strengthen their credentials through tasks and contributions. This unlocks entirely new incentive mechanics, where platforms drive participation through a person’s willingness to earn. These can be functions of onboarding or supporting protocols and platforms, but for the individual, it becomes a way for them to gain benefits throughout participation in the ecosystem. Accruing reputation can lead to better jobs, better compensation, and even more so, a clearer perspective as to who you are working alongside and with. It starts to put the value of data on unlocking experiences over just the relationship with content and information.\n\nHow will this play out? We’re seeing it in real-time. At a moment of web3 acceleration, we’re in yet another experiment to understand how incentives can be more meritocratic and fair. As we saw with the NFT boom and the countless Discord servers filled with “wen token” speculators — we’re nowhere close yet. Reputation still plays a minuscule role in obtaining access to opportunities, and most access is still gated by one’s wallet value and ability to get in early.\n\nAs more founders and their companies begin to emerge focused on this challenge, I’m excited to see how efforts can move the other way — your contributions and participation are how you earn and accumulate value. We want to build a world where leverage is earned not just through capital, but through high fidelity, verifiable data that captures genuine contribution to the space. The additional data captured isn’t simply to improve upon experiences and services captured by a monolithic platform, but viewable across the ecosystem to facilitate more transactions and collaborations. Only then, we can structure a healthier, more collaborative ecosystem across the web — one that truly puts individual rights front and center. This is the leverage used to build more opportunities for individuals themselves, and structure healthier, more collaborative ecosystems across the web.\n\n\n---\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZLN4Xf_iQZ8Lr5D1lqKPb.png?height=766&width=1532)\n\n**The future of work is coming, and we are all its contributors.**\n\nIf these are questions you’d also like to explore, we invite you to become a contributor to the Station protocol or to participate in our research efforts through Newstand, Station’s publication focused on exploring the possibility of work in an era of hyper connectivity and fluidity.\n\n**[Station Newstand](https://station.express/) is open 24/7.** We’re inviting writers, artists, and researchers across all disciplines to push forward radical imagination around the future of work unlocked by crypto.

In fact, Hayek attacked the assertion by quoting history facts, that the monopoly first prevailed in those countries with less advanced economic system and comparatively young industry and the monopolization as the aftermath of protection policy in British, and concluded that the trend was no less than the consequence of the assistance of the power of the state to make control effective. \n  \n While this assertion is inconceivable on the term of facts, I think it also neglects the factor of quality change, because it fundamentally relies on the condition in which the whole competition is pure quantitative, that also become the evidence of simple-oriented idealism which will be mentioned afterwards. \n  \n While this assertion is inconceivable on the term of facts, I think it also neglects the factor of quality change, because it fundamentally relies on the condition in which the whole competition is pure quantitative, that also become the evidence of simple-oriented idealism which will be mentioned afterwards.\n\n> Of the various arguments employed to demonstrate the inevitability of planning, the one most frequently heard is that technological changes have made competition impossible in a constantly increasing number of fields and that the only choice left to us is between control of production by private monopolies and direction by the government. This belief derives mainly from the Marxist doctrine of the “concentration of industry,” \n  \n The important question is whether this development is a necessary consequence of the advance of technology or whether it is simply the result of the policies pursued in most countries. \n  \n This argument singles out one effect sometimes accompanying technological progress; it disregards others which work in the opposite direction; and it receives little support from a serious study of the facts. \n  \n An investigation of conditions in England would lead to very similar results. Anyone who has observed how aspiring monopolists regularly seek and frequently obtain the assistance of the power of the state to make their control effective can have little doubt that there is nothing inevitable about this development. \n  \n If they were the result of technological developments or a necessary product of the evolution of “capitalism,” we should expect them to appear first in the countries with the most advanced economic system. In fact, they appeared first during the last third of the nineteenth century in what were then comparatively young industrial countries, the United States and Germany. \n  \n Not only the instrument of protection but direct inducements and ultimately compulsion were used by the governments to further the creation of monopolies for the regulation of prices and sales. \n  \n And, although during the 1920s it suffered severely from incompatible policies followed with regard to wages and to money, at least the years up to 1929 compare with regard to employment and general activity not unfavorably with the 1930s. It is only since the transition to protection and the general change in British economic policy accompanying it that the growth of monopolies has proceeded at an amazing rate and has transformed British industry to an extent the public has scarcely yet realized.\n\n### Two: Fate of Overwhelming Outside Events\n\nSome argued it was due to outside events instead of public opinion, that Hayek responded briefly with German as the example.\n\n> It could thus be argued that monopolistic organization of industry grew up in spite of the fact that public opinion still favored competition but that outside events frustrated their  wishes.\n>\n> In the progressive advance toward a  completely  planned  society  the  Germans,  and  all  the  people  who  are imitating their example, are merely following the course which nineteenth-century  thinkers,  particularly  Germans,  have  mapped  out  for  them.  The intellectual  history  of  the  last  sixty  or  eighty  years  is  indeed  a  perfect illustration  of  the  truth  that  in  social  evolution  nothing  is  inevitable  but thinking makes it so.\n\n### Three: The Problematic Complexity from Competition\n\nThe third thesis supporting the inevitability of planning suggested the complexity resulted from competition would contribute to dissolve social life into chaos. That hinted condition, the social life should be formed for a simple deliberately arranged organization so that individual could master it entirely, could only be desirable for those simple-oriented thinkers who leave out the complexity of the real world to understand it easily and to change it into simpler one with simple method. They would recast for a new world what they like, it demonstrates them selfish in a sense while portends the totalitarian herald. It is not enough for me just to judge it and infer a potential thread of it, Hayek undertook the competition positively, he said, no other than this complexity allowed competition to become self-coordinate without which the division of labor could never be so efficient and a growth of material could never exist.\n\n> It  may  mean  that  the complexity of our modern industrial civilization creates new problems with which we cannot hope to deal effectively except by central planning.\n>\n> What they generally suggest is that the increasing difficulty of obtaining  a  coherent  picture  of  the  complete  economic  process  makes  it indispensable that things should be coordinated by some central agency if social life is not to dissolve in chaos.\n>\n> This argument is based on a complete misapprehension of the working of competition.  Far  from  being  appropriate  only  to  comparatively  simple conditions, it is the very complexity of the division of labor under modern conditions  which  makes  competition  the  only  method  by  which  such coordination can be adequately brought about. There would be no difficulty about efficient control or planning were conditions so simple that a single person or board could effectively survey all the relevant facts. It is only as the factors which have to be taken into account become so numerous that it is impossible to gain a synoptic view of them that decentralization becomes imperative.  But,  once  decentralization  is  necessary,  the  problem  of coordination arises—a coordination which leaves the separate agencies free to  adjust  their  activities  to  the  facts  which  only  they  can  know  and  yet brings  about  a  mutual  adjustment  of  their  respective  plans.  As decentralization  has  become  necessary  because  nobody  can  consciously balance  all  the  considerations  bearing  on  the  decisions  of  so  many individuals,  the  coordination  can  clearly  be  effected  not  by  “conscious control”  but  only  by  arrangements  which  convey  to  each  agent  the information he must possess in order effectively to adjust his decisions to those  of  others.  And  because  all  the  details  of  the  changes  constantly affecting the conditions of demand and supply of the different commodities can never be fully known, or quickly enough be collected and disseminated, by any one center, what is required is some apparatus of registration which automatically  records  all  the  relevant  effects  of  individual  actions  and whose indications are at the same time the resultant of, and the guide for, all the individual decisions.\n\n### Four: Single-minded Benefits\n\nIf all people use the same product, the costs could be limited least leading to a much lower price while the product would monopolize in corresponding area, then whether should we not to allow this happens? Hayek would say no, because it thwarts the developing of new inventions which benefits more in a long term to obtain an immediate interest. On the other hand, It's absurd that we destroy our most precious inheritance: liberty for the little welfare. Like simple-oriented thinkers, they're single-minded, so Hayek called, who being monopoly thrive the affairs only they value. Finally, it's crucial that the single-minded benefits do not claim the inevitability of planning.\n\n> it  contends  not  that  modern  technique destroys competition but that, on the contrary, it will be impossible to make use of many of the new technological possibilities unless protection against competition is granted, i.e., a monopoly is conferred.\n>\n> But  it  must  be  admitted  that  it  is  possible  that,  by compulsory standardization or the prohibition of variety beyond a certain degree, abundance might be increased in some fields more than sufficiently to compensate for the restriction of the choice of the consumer. It is even conceivable that a new invention may be made some day whose adoption would  seem  unquestionably  beneficial  but  which  could  be  used  only  if many or all people were made to avail themselves of it at the same time.\n>\n> Whether such instances are of any great or lasting importance, they are certainly not instances where it could be legitimately claimed that technical progress  makes  central  direction  inevitable.\n>\n> By  sacrificing  such  possible  present advantages, we preserve an important stimulus to further progress. Though in the short run the price we have to pay for variety and freedom of choice may sometimes be high, in the long run even material progress will depend on this very variety, because we can never predict from which of the many forms in which a good or service can be provided something better may develop.\n>\n> the argument for freedom is precisely that we ought to leave room for the unforeseeable free growth\n>\n> While it is true, of course, that inventions have given us tremendous power, it is absurd to  suggest  that  we  must  use  this  power  to  destroy  our  most  precious inheritance: liberty.\n>\n> It  would  be  more  correct  to  say  that  such  extreme  technical excellence out of line with general conditions is evidence of a misdirection of resources.\n>\n> The illusion of the specialist that in a planned society he would secure more attention to the objectives for which he cares most is a more general phenomenon than the term “specialist” at first suggests\n>\n> But,  of  course,  the  adoption  of  the  social planning for which they clamor can only bring out the concealed conflict between their aims.\n>\n> The movement for planning owes its present strength largely to the fact that, while planning is in the main still an ambition, it unites almost all single-minded  idealists,  all  the  men  and  women  who  have  devoted  their lives to a single task.", "timestamp": 1653396899, "digest": "ah98FrrjN9bAFxWEOI5XRGQnZ-MHIvIEf0jI7FChK5U", "contributor": "0x97a02207875aeb060Cf90bDf1312523724CefE7f"}

{"id": "Uta-9EziEPFuzoXYZzD2C3gB7fHEUREKraBbrQlYsDg", "title": "Disciples' Engagement Forum", "body": "## The Vision and Mission of the DEF\n\nHow might we, as followers of Christ, reshape the systems of the world to be subsumed by and exist within His Kingdom? The command to “love God and love your neighbor” empowers us to spread God's blessing and fulfill the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations. The world of web3 and the “cryptocosm” enables His disciples to leverage new tools, rules, and team structures to alleviate the physical, moral, and spiritual bankruptcy which pervades society.\n\nThis Disciples’ Engagement Forum (DEF) will provide a space to educate each other, evangelize the broader community, and empower followers of Christ to build for His Kingdom on earth. The core function of the group will be to promote positive public dialog and encourage engagement by rewarding meaningful contribution and developing a network. Tactically, the DEF will take the form of a short (one page maximum) weekly article which explores the confluence of economics, history, institutional or systemic change, and faith. Each of these articles will end with a prompt or “call to action”, which will be posted to Twitter as a free “hook” to engage more people and encourage them to subscribe to the weekly articles.\n\n## Operations of the DEF\n\n### A primer on the Growth Flywheel\n\nThe network growth model of the DEF is based on the Product-led Growth Flywheel from [productled.org](https://www.productled.org/foundations/the-product-led-growth-flywheel). This model shown below demonstrates how new users evaluating a product will Activate as Beginners, those Beginners then make the decision to Adopt to become Regulars, the Regulars soon learn to Adore the product to become Champions, and product Champions will Advocate a product to encourage new Evaluators to Activate, and the cycle repeats. In this way a new product can achieve exponential growth in its user and customer base.\n\n![Figure 1: PLG Flywheel](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/apNYxzHhqZ1pDf9X_KvcQ.jpg?height=1084&width=1580)\n\n### The DEF Operations Flywheel\n\nThe model for this forum will be to use Twitter as a free resource to engage and activate new users with thoughtful prompts, encourage those new users to subscribe to the publication on Mirror.xyz to access weekly articles and resources, create a sense of ownership by selling articles and artifacts as NFTs, and incentivize healthy and sustainable network growth by [sharing subscription revenue with NFT owners](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide).\n\n![Figure 2: DEF Flywheel](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Wab8Yg4mPPHqRlfm6WbF2.jpg?height=1340&width=1678)\n\nTwitter will be used to encourage free, open, and limited engagement and maximize exposure. Mirror.xyz provides a platform for users to subscribe to longer-form articles (one page maximum), and the subscription paywall encourages meaningful and positive contributions. Mirror.xyz also provides a model to turn artifacts such as articles into a purchasable NFT which gives owners a stake in the forum’s success, and the interplay between the free Twitter, subscription-based articles, and ownership-based NFTs is meant to create sustainable product growth.\n\n### DEF Revenue Sharing Model\n\nThere are 4 personas involved in revenue:\n\n1. **Creative Team Members**: write and post articles, edit content, and manage the Mirror.xyz and Twitter feeds\n2. **NFT Owners**: purchase artifacts minted as NFTs and maintain a share of subscription profits\n3. **Subscribers**: pay subscription fees on mirror.xyz in order to access articles and artifacts\n4. **General Users**: Engage with prompts posted to Twitter, but have no access to Mirror.xyz articles until they subscribe on the platform\n\nThere are two sources of revenue- subscription fees which are shared by all NFT Owners to incentivize growth of the DEF, and NFT sales which are distributed amongst the Creative Team Members to compensate for maintaining the DEF.\n\n## DEF Kickoff Roadmap\n\nThe DEF Creative Team Members will have much to learn and many trials and errors as we release this product, and there are aspects which will need to change. A full release roadmap is in development, and as that is being built our team will focus on the following tasks for a launch:\n\n![Figure 3: DEF Kickoff Roadmap](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OHuf6jGXlWR5RCuBL6DxK.png?height=550&width=937)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Where will these articles and prompts be released?** Articles will be posted on the Johannes Talbotus Mirror.xyz site: <url tbd>. Prompts will be posted on the Johannes Talbotus Twitter: https://twitter.com/j_talbotus\n\n**How many people will engage initially?**\n\nInitial engagement will be understandably low. In order to address that, the access to articles on Mirror.xyz will be free for a limited time to build a network and an active following.\n\n**When will the first article and prompt be shared?**\n\nThe MVP for release will be articles on Mirror.xyz and posted Twitter prompts, which will be launched in May. At that time, the full monetization and revenue sharing model will not be in place. The subscriptions, NFT sales, and revenue sharing will follow in the future.\n\n**How often will articles and prompts be released?**\n\nThe initial plan is for a weekly release of one article on Mirror.xyz, followed immediately by the posting of a prompt to Twitter. Articles and prompts will be released Mondays, with future NFT sales happening later in the week.\n\n**Why introduce payments and not keep this free?**\n\nCo-founder of Netscape and investment firm Andreessen-Horowitz, Marc Andreessen claims “the original sin of the internet was not including a payment option in the browser”. This means that all revenue is generated by advertising, and therefore incentivizes maximum engagement at all costs. This model has led naturally to incentivizing and promoting negative behavior, as anger and fear have proven to drive engagement. Our hypothesis is that basing revenue on subscription and a “stake in the game” will incentivize positive and meaningful engagement instead of trolling and negative interactions.\n\n**How will revenue sharing be structured?**\n\nThis will be tested and optimized through the early release. The initial model will be for all NFT sales revenue to be split amongst the DEF Creative Team Members, and for all subscription revenue to be split evenly with NFT Owners. This means that for each new NFT release, the previous owners’ stake will be diluted. This will encourage owners to counteract that dilution by either encouraging more subscribers to increase the revenue they share, or by purchasing another NFT artifact to increase their stake in the shared revenue.\n\n**What is the long term goal of the DEF?**\n\nThe DEF will be a place for Christians who want to build in Web3 to connect, learn from others, and engage the broader community.

In fact, Hayek attacked the assertion by quoting history facts, that the monopoly first prevailed in those countries with less advanced economic system and comparatively young industry and the monopolization as the aftermath of protection policy in British, and concluded that the trend was no less than the consequence of the assistance of the power of the state to make control effective.\n\nWhile this assertion is inconceivable on the term of facts, I think it also neglects the factor of quality change, because it fundamentally relies on the condition in which the whole competition is pure quantitative, that also become the evidence of simple-oriented idealism which will be mentioned afterwards.\n\nWhile this assertion is inconceivable on the term of facts, I think it also neglects the factor of quality change, because it fundamentally relies on the condition in which the whole competition is pure quantitative, that also become the evidence of simple-oriented idealism which will be mentioned afterwards.\n\n> Of the various arguments employed to demonstrate the inevitability of planning, the one most frequently heard is that technological changes have made competition impossible in a constantly increasing number of fields and that the only choice left to us is between control of production by private monopolies and direction by the government. This belief derives mainly from the Marxist doctrine of the “concentration of industry,”\n\nThe important question is whether this development is a necessary consequence of the advance of technology or whether it is simply the result of the policies pursued in most countries.\n\nThis argument singles out one effect sometimes accompanying technological progress; it disregards others which work in the opposite direction; and it receives little support from a serious study of the facts.\n\nAn investigation of conditions in England would lead to very similar results. Anyone who has observed how aspiring monopolists regularly seek and frequently obtain the assistance of the power of the state to make their control effective can have little doubt that there is nothing inevitable about this development.\n\nIf they were the result of technological developments or a necessary product of the evolution of “capitalism,” we should expect them to appear first in the countries with the most advanced economic system. In fact, they appeared first during the last third of the nineteenth century in what were then comparatively young industrial countries, the United States and Germany.\n\nNot only the instrument of protection but direct inducements and ultimately compulsion were used by the governments to further the creation of monopolies for the regulation of prices and sales.\n\nAnd, although during the 1920s it suffered severely from incompatible policies followed with regard to wages and to money, at least the years up to 1929 compare with regard to employment and general activity not unfavorably with the 1930s. It is only since the transition to protection and the general change in British economic policy accompanying it that the growth of monopolies has proceeded at an amazing rate and has transformed British industry to an extent the public has scarcely yet realized.\n\n### Two: Fate of Overwhelming Outside Events\n\nSome argued it was due to outside events instead of public opinion, that Hayek responded briefly with German as the example.\n\n> It could thus be argued that monopolistic organization of industry grew up in spite of the fact that public opinion still favored competition but that outside events frustrated their  wishes.\n>\n> In the progressive advance toward a  completely  planned  society  the  Germans,  and  all  the  people  who  are imitating their example, are merely following the course which nineteenth-century  thinkers,  particularly  Germans,  have  mapped  out  for  them.  The intellectual  history  of  the  last  sixty  or  eighty  years  is  indeed  a  perfect illustration  of  the  truth  that  in  social  evolution  nothing  is  inevitable  but thinking makes it so.\n\n### Three: The Problematic Complexity from Competition\n\nThe third thesis supporting the inevitability of planning suggested the complexity resulted from competition would contribute to dissolve social life into chaos. That hinted condition, the social life should be formed for a simple deliberately arranged organization so that individual could master it entirely, could only be desirable for those simple-oriented thinkers who leave out the complexity of the real world to understand it easily and to change it into simpler one with simple method. They would recast for a new world what they like, it demonstrates them selfish in a sense while portends the totalitarian herald. It is not enough for me just to judge it and infer a potential thread of it, Hayek undertook the competition positively, he said, no other than this complexity allowed competition to become self-coordinate without which the division of labor could never be so efficient and a growth of material could never exist.\n\n> It  may  mean  that  the complexity of our modern industrial civilization creates new problems with which we cannot hope to deal effectively except by central planning.\n>\n> What they generally suggest is that the increasing difficulty of obtaining  a  coherent  picture  of  the  complete  economic  process  makes  it indispensable that things should be coordinated by some central agency if social life is not to dissolve in chaos.\n>\n> This argument is based on a complete misapprehension of the working of competition.  Far  from  being  appropriate  only  to  comparatively  simple conditions, it is the very complexity of the division of labor under modern conditions  which  makes  competition  the  only  method  by  which  such coordination can be adequately brought about. There would be no difficulty about efficient control or planning were conditions so simple that a single person or board could effectively survey all the relevant facts. It is only as the factors which have to be taken into account become so numerous that it is impossible to gain a synoptic view of them that decentralization becomes imperative.  But,  once  decentralization  is  necessary,  the  problem  of coordination arises—a coordination which leaves the separate agencies free to  adjust  their  activities  to  the  facts  which  only  they  can  know  and  yet brings  about  a  mutual  adjustment  of  their  respective  plans.  As decentralization  has  become  necessary  because  nobody  can  consciously balance  all  the  considerations  bearing  on  the  decisions  of  so  many individuals,  the  coordination  can  clearly  be  effected  not  by  “conscious control”  but  only  by  arrangements  which  convey  to  each  agent  the information he must possess in order effectively to adjust his decisions to those  of  others.  And  because  all  the  details  of  the  changes  constantly affecting the conditions of demand and supply of the different commodities can never be fully known, or quickly enough be collected and disseminated, by any one center, what is required is some apparatus of registration which automatically  records  all  the  relevant  effects  of  individual  actions  and whose indications are at the same time the resultant of, and the guide for, all the individual decisions.\n\n### Four: Single-minded Benefits\n\nIf all people use the same product, the costs could be limited least leading to a much lower price while the product would monopolize in corresponding area, then whether should we not to allow this happens? Hayek would say no, because it thwarts the developing of new inventions which benefits more in a long term to obtain an immediate interest. On the other hand, It's absurd that we destroy our most precious inheritance: liberty for the little welfare. Like simple-oriented thinkers, they're single-minded, so Hayek called, who being monopoly thrive the affairs only they value. Finally, it's crucial that the single-minded benefits do not claim the inevitability of planning.\n\n> it  contends  not  that  modern  technique destroys competition but that, on the contrary, it will be impossible to make use of many of the new technological possibilities unless protection against competition is granted, i.e., a monopoly is conferred.\n>\n> But  it  must  be  admitted  that  it  is  possible  that,  by compulsory standardization or the prohibition of variety beyond a certain degree, abundance might be increased in some fields more than sufficiently to compensate for the restriction of the choice of the consumer.

周四凌晨2点公布5月份议息会议纪要，6月预计继续加息50基点，并开始缩表，但19日美联储资产负债表又增加了147亿美元，明显言行不一。猴痘传播也许会影响美联储后续政策。\n* 拜登和耶伦表示将取消进口中国商品关税，有利于从根本上解决通胀。\n* 美国会2022年已经提出超过80份加密相关法案，创历史新高，足见美高层的关注。美国众议院5名议员提出，将加密货币加入401(k)退休计划中。\n* 美国商品期货交易委员会主席表示，比特币和以太坊是商品，而SEC认为是证券，二者争权。\n* 日本民主党提议修改税法支持Web3发展，吸引人才和投资流入。\n* 穆迪表示，信用评级最低的国家，加密货币使用率最高。\n* 推特创始人Jack表示，比特币是互联网上唯一货币，对未来坚定信心，不关心价格，主要关心采用率。\n* 风险投资家Tim Draper表示，随着投机者离开，比特币走势将与科技股背离，看好比特币的对冲通胀属性，目前依然看好。Coinbase联合创始人买入7500万美元自家股票。\n* 机构交易所LMAX CEO表示，近期机构用户正在大幅增持比特币。以色列信用卡公司MAX和Sracard允许购买比特币。瑞士私人银行宝盛集团为高净值用户提供加密资产服务。\n* 一季度，全球区块链行业融资超90亿美元，创历史新高。\n* V神表示，ETH2.0再早8月合并，晚至9-10月。\n* 加密研究机构Santiment分析数据显示，当前比特币和加密货币市场悲观程度已达到2020年312以来的最高水平。\n\n# 1、BTC及总体市场分析\n\n## 1.1、BTC链上数据及中长期指标\n\n### 1.1.1、BTC链上地址及币量\n\n### \\~地址及网络：小额地址增持，大额地址持平\n\n* 本周余额1\\~10的地址量，继续大幅增长，创新高。而余额为10\\~100地址量周内震荡，100\\~1k地址量略增，＞1k地址量略减，表明大额地址增持不明显。随着币价绝对值提高，可能囤币党更倾向于分散小额存储。\n* 活跃地址情绪量表示活跃地址增速与价格增速的比值，目前已跌破下边界，并到达历次熊市大底附近区域。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lxop6E9Zg98wgGp0Bqbi1.png?height=1263&width=2000)\n\n### \\~一年以上持有量占比：65.5%继续新高\n\n* 上周本指标小幅震荡，本周又继续创新高，表明上周虽因暴跌导致部分长期持有者减持，但本周又重新开始继续增持。\n\n### \\~Liveliness活跃度指标：又进入HODL\n\n* 上周大幅反弹，表明长期持有者抛售。本周重新开始下跌，长期持有者又开始HODL。\n\n### \\~储备风险Reserve Risk：历史大底区间\n\n* 本指标与上周持平，无明显变化，目前价位依然属于历史级别的底部区间。\n\n### \\~长期持有者持币数：盘整区内小幅积累\n\n* 本处长期持有者指持有超过6个月。下图绿线为抛售区，红线为积累区，蓝线为盘整区。\n* 1月26日到达最高点，表明从21年5月开始的积累区基本结束，进入盘整期，在币价没有明显大涨之前，不会进入大周期抛售区。\n* 根据2019年经验，在盘整区内会因币价反弹和回调，而出现小区间的抛售和积累，目前属于小区间的积累末端。后续如果大幅反弹会有短期抄底减持；若继续大跌会继续有恐慌盘退出，而再次出现小区间抛售。本指标短期没有太强的指向性。\n\n![图片来源：Lianshucha](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HLYlbAFS5Q5PaeJzexsCj.png?height=1272&width=1928)\n\n### \\~持有年龄分布：1\\~6月减持，其他增持\n\n* 分析持有年龄分布，在5月12日前后的大跌过程中，1\\~6月减持为主，小于1个月的增持为主，6\\~12个月小幅增持，1年以上微量增持。\n* 表明1\\~6月短线投机者无法承受下跌风险，卖出为主；卖出的币主要被新增地址抄底买入，这些新开地址，应该多数也是长线投资群体。\n\n### 1.1.2、BTC中长期指标\n\n### \\~BTC MVRV Ratio：1.2， 低估\n\n* 本指标与上周相比无变化，不再赘述。\n\n### \\~已实现价格Realized price：距离指标16%\n\n* 本指标与上周相比无变化，不再赘述。\n\n### \\~Ahr999囤币&x指数：0.52，定投区间下边缘\n\n* 囤币指数在12日最低点时为0.42，已跌入抄底区间0.45，目前0.52，定投区间下边缘。\n\n### \\~2-Year乘数通道：大幅跌破2年线\n\n* 本指标与上周相比无变化，不再赘述。\n\n### \\~市场健康程度：历史大底\n\n* 本周该指标依然在低位，与2015年和2018年大熊市底部的数值相当。\n\n### \\~交易所余额及占比：小户卖大户接\n\n* 本周币价无太大变化，交易所余额维持短暂的平衡。\n* 根据CryptoQuant数据，按照7日平均统计，流入52329笔，平均每笔1枚；流出6800笔，平均每笔6枚。可见小户的抛售被大户承接了。\n\n### \\~挖矿成本：28743美元\n\n* 根据财经M平方数据，目前挖矿成本为28743美元，接近现价。\n\n### \\~矿工地址：没有大量抛售，反而在增持\n\n* 矿工地址在21年5月有过较大的抛售，储备了资金，而在年初反而因下跌加仓。本次512大跌有少量抛售，但随后又更多增持。也就是矿工群体认为此位置价格不适合卖出反而更适合买入。\n\n![图片来源：CryptoQuant](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gROcez7MaLxLLVI_PArGt.png?height=830&width=1594)\n\n## 1.2、短期指标及期货市场数据\n\n### \\~恐慌贪婪指数：8\\~14\n\n* 本周恐慌指数为8\\~14，极度恐慌，从9日跌到15以下，已连续打14天，超过2018年熊市大底，仅次于312的25天。市场恐慌情绪非常严重，尤其是17日，币价未跌，但指数为8。阶段底部特征明显。\n\n### \\~期货资金费率：零附近\n\n* 本周资金费率维持在零附近，偏空。\n\n![图片来源：coinglass.com](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GdhsNuz1Kbd15orAgfb7H.png?height=511&width=1358)\n\n### \\~合约持仓量：增加明显\n\n* BTC合约，按照USD计算，上周去杠杆35%。本周按BTC本位统计，合约持仓量又有了明显的增长。\n\n![图片来源：coinglass.com](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Kfe3TnJRzpK1Hf2RAuW7b.png?height=508&width=1293)\n\n### \\~爆仓量：大幅缩量\n\n### \\~合约成交额：大幅缩量\n\n### \\~合约多空比：基本持平\n\n* 本周多空比基本持平，但Bitfinex多占占比高达\n\n## 1.3、BTC走势分析及总结\n\n* 本周市场毫无波澜，在28668\\~31280小幅震荡，大跌后的修复期，维持上周的判断。BTC在此处为阶段底部，形成了日线和周线级别的假突破，市场悲观气氛浓重，恐慌情绪达到2020年以来最高点。\n* 本周交易所流入流出维持平衡，但流入卖出以小额为主，流出买入以大额为主。\n* 相关估值指标与上周相同，目前依然是底部区间。\n* 近期Bitfinex的多头头寸大幅增加60%，而其上次大幅增加是21年5\\~7月份。FTX合约持仓量也大增，以费率判断以多头头寸为主。这两个交易所都是机构常用平台。\n* BTC与标普SPX和纳指NDQ保持周同步，但周内有日级别的背离不同步，期待走出独立行情。\n\n![图片来源：tradingview](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uA-V1teQcNUtEXDU6TNgJ.png?height=768&width=1813)\n\n## 1.4、全市场分析\n\n### \\~全市场周数据\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PdbF14vprKrryNONNxVKF.png?height=327&width=674)\n\n* 本周小幅震荡为主，BTC小跌，ETH等山寨跌幅超过BTC，上周大幅攀升的市占率得以维持。\n* 稳定币，11日\\~22日，USDT减少了98.73亿，USDC增加了45.21亿，BUSD增加了14.33亿，净减少39.19亿，可能主要愿意USDT负溢价带来的赎回套利，而新入场资金通过USDC和BUSD进入。\n\n# 2、关注ALT项目\n\n## 2.1、Top20手续费收入排行\n\n*

8800)的机器，宣称它是第一台个人计算机。计算机虽然早就出现了，可是由于技术的限制，当时的计算机体积还比较庞大，价格也是不菲，，不是人人都能拥有的只有大机构才能配备。\n\n而这台牵牛星8800价格十分便宜，不到500美金。而且这台机器还具备拓展能力，用户可以根据自己的需要添加设备。\n\n \n\n(当年的大众电子杂志以及牵牛星8800)\n\n \n\n艾伦读了这篇文章后，马上找到了盖茨。他们觉得千载难逢的机会就在眼前。\n\n这台牵牛星8800的功能十分有限，只是一台粗糙的计算机，基本上你什么都做不了，没有键盘，没有软件，只能拨弄一些开关，然后开开灯泡这类的。\n\n盖茨觉得他们可以给这台机器开发一个解释器，这样就可以在上面开发些软件了。于是他们给开发了牵牛星8800的MITS公司主席Ed Roberts写了封信，说他们给牵牛星8800写了一个BASIC解释器，问MITS有没有兴趣合作。\n\nMITS给盖茨回了一封信，不过这封信寄却到了盖茨西雅图的家里，他那时候在哈佛，盖茨就没受到那封信。等了一段时间，盖茨他们看到MITS没回应，就想该怎么办。他们想要不主动联系一下吧，这次别写信了直接打电话吧。但是他们都想让对方去打电话，因为他们都有点害怕。最后，他们想出一个办法，由盖茨来打电话，他对生意的事情比较懂，但是盖茨要假装自己是艾伦，因为艾伦看起来更老成一些，他们不想让对方知道自己是个乳臭未干的学生。电话通了之后，盖茨说他和他的朋友正在为这台机器开发BASIC，而且快完成了，MITS有没有兴趣合作。不过实际上，盖茨他们连一台牵牛星8800都没有(他们只在那本杂志的封面上见过那台计算机)，也没有为这台机器写过什么代码，他们只是想看看MITS有没有兴趣。Roberts在电话那头说：“真的吗？已经有50个人跟我们说他们开发了BASIC了。但是他们什么都没做出来。谁第一个做出来，我就跟谁合作。 ”\n\n \n\n接下来的几周盖茨和艾伦疯狂的编程。艾伦开发出一个牵牛星的模拟器，盖茨则扑在BASIC上。开发完成之后，他们决定由艾伦去跟MITS碰面。出发前一天晚上，艾伦去休息了，盖茨则通宵查bug。第二天在飞机上，艾伦突然发现他们漏了点东西：引导加载程序(bootstrap loader)。有了这个程序计算机才能知道怎么把数据读入内存。当时距离飞机降落时间已经不多了。没有办法，艾伦就在飞机上写了一个。\n\n那之前，他们的软件都没真正的测试过。\n\n好在最后在MITS的演示很成功，Roberts很满意。双方决定合作。盖茨和艾伦授权MITS使用他们的BASIC。艾伦回到波士顿与盖茨一起庆祝，去吃了冰淇淋和软饮料。(说个小插曲，艾伦到了MITS那边的时候，Roberts带他去一家酒店落脚。艾伦当时没有足够的钱，只能很不好意思地跟Roberts借。)\n\n \n\n随后艾伦进入MITS工作，担任软件开发部门负责人，其实整个部门就他一个人。\n\n不久盖茨也跟了过去。艾伦给他们的公司起名叫做：Micro-Soft。没多久，他们把中间的横杠去掉了，MicroSoft正式登上历史舞台。\n\n \n\n盖茨觉得这可是千年等一回的机会，于是想从哈佛退学，全心投入自己的事业。他的父母还是强烈反对，他们都希望盖茨能拿个大学文凭。盖茨的母亲找来一位朋友：Samuel，希望Samuel能说服自己的儿子别退学。\n\nSamuel是个白手起家的百万富翁，没上过大学，二战后开了家公司，由此发迹。他是当时西雅图少有的懂计算机的企业家。\n\n \n\n一天Samuel跟盖茨去一家餐厅吃了午餐，席间盖茨不停的说着他的计划，以及当时计算机行业即将发生的变革。听完之后，Samuel被眼前这个年轻人的激情感动了，似乎看到了年轻时的自己，最后不仅没劝盖茨别退学，反而鼓励他去创业。“我当时犯了一个严重的错误，没有开一张支票，让盖茨填好数字。”(意即给盖茨投资)多年后，Samuel半开玩笑的说道。\n\n事已至此，盖茨的父母也没有办法了。盖茨终于从哈佛退学。\n\n成立了微软之后，盖茨和艾伦谈到了分配股权的问题。一开始艾伦觉得会是平分，但是盖茨觉得不对，他认为艾伦的贡献没有他的大，他提议他占60%，艾伦拿40%。艾伦同意了。\n\n有一天，盖茨约艾伦出去走走。不一会，他说：你看老哥，活基本都是我干的，而且我从哈佛退学，放弃了很多东西，我觉得我应该占更多的股份。\n\n艾伦问：你觉得你要占多少？\n\n盖茨说：64 ：36。\n\n经过一番思想斗争，艾伦还是同意了。\n\n \n\n（早年的盖茨与艾伦）\n\n \n\n（1975年的盖茨）\n\n \n\n很早以前艾伦就跟盖茨设想将来计算机会大有前途，而不仅仅只是爱好者手中的玩具，计算机应该进入千家万户。一开始跟MITS合作的时候，他们就清楚的知道，不能只依赖MITS这一家公司，他们的软件应该可以用在所有的机器上。在跟MITS签署的协议上就确保了微软能把他们的软件授权给其它公司。\n\n牵牛星8800在美国的计算机爱好者圈子里引起了不小的反响。受此影响的就包括乔布斯和[沃兹尼亚克](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B2%83%E5%85%B9%E5%B0%BC%E4%BA%9A%E5%85%8B)，这两位联手创办了苹果电脑公司，成就了另一段传奇。\n\n牵牛星给微软带来的收入却不多。因为牵牛星上使用BASIC的人大概只有十分之一的人真的付了钱。这些人都自视为GEEK，他们认为信息不应该有版权，而是应该自由分享。然而盖茨却不这么看。\n\n盖茨给这些爱好者们写了封公开信，信中指责他们这种行为为“偷窃”，他认为软件跟硬件一样，都要出钱买。“不能赚钱谁还会去开发软件？”\n\n \n\n（当年的公开信原件）\n\n \n\n这封信并没起到多大效果。看来美帝人民在盗版面前跟天朝人民是一样的。此路不通那就只能另寻他法。后来盖茨终于想到：把软件卖给硬件厂家，然后厂家把成本加到电脑上去。这样他们只需要跟硬件商收钱而不用管盗版的问题了。\n\n艾伦连连拍手称秒，“高，实在是高！”。\n\n \n\n(盖茨与艾伦)\n\n \n\n1977年，有其它的厂家加入了计算机行业，市面上涌现除出其它的计算机，比较有代表性的是：TRS-80,苹果II,PET。这些电脑各有特点，但有一个共同点：后来都安装了微软的BASIC。刚开始这三家公司用的都是自家的BASIC，但是质量平平，最后不得不找到掌握了核心科技的盖茨，为他们开发 BASIC。随着计算机行业的发展，微软的生意也水涨船高。\n\n事情也有不顺利的时候。盖茨跟MITS的Roberts就对不上眼，两人经常吵架。别看年轻的盖茨长着一张娃娃脸，笑起来人畜无害似的，却是个暴脾气，他们对软件开发和商业方向的问题上有很大分歧，Roberts觉得盖茨令人讨厌。而且有时候他们会在与计算机无关的问题上争执不休。比如美国应不应该对日本投放原子弹。到最后像是为了争论而争论。\n\n1977年，乔布斯和[沃兹尼亚克](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%96%AF%E8%92%82%E5%A4%AB%C2%B7%E6%B2%83%E5%85%B9%E5%B0%BC%E4%BA%9A%E5%85%8B)推出的苹果II电脑，集成了显示器，键盘，用户不需要自己再去额外配置这些东西。一上市便大受欢迎。苹果II真正的引爆了计算机革命。（再说一句，苹果一开始用的是[沃兹尼亚克](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%96%AF%E8%92%82%E5%A4%AB%C2%B7%E6%B2%83%E5%85%B9%E5%B0%BC%E4%BA%9A%E5%85%8B)写的BASIC，但是最后由于种种原因，乔布斯还是找来盖茨，为苹果II开发BASIC，看来盖茨的编程功力十分了得）\n\n \n\n \n\n（苹果II电脑）\n\n苹果凭借苹果II开始崛起，MITS则步履维艰，公司每况愈下。1977年， Roberts不得不把MITS卖给了另一家电脑公司，回到乔治亚，进入一所医学院读书，后来当了一名医生。多年后谈起盖茨心中依然五味杂陈。\n\n \n\n好在盖茨他们早有准备，MITS的失败对他们影响不大。\n\n正如前面所说，当年其它男孩子还在读Playboy的时候，盖茨就经常阅读商业书籍。所以盖茨对商业的事务有些了解。这时这些商业知识就派上了用场。盖茨既写代码，又做销售，连法律事务也能分担部分。每天出去拉业务，还真给他拉来了不少。\n\n随之而来的问题就是人手不够了。\n\n1977年他们招了一位42岁的助理。在那之前，他们招了一位年轻漂亮的助理，那助理却不喜欢这乱糟糟的工作环境，以及暴脾气的小鬼：盖茨。没两天就辞职不干了。盖茨觉得他们要找的“不是一个花瓶，而是热心肠，事无巨细的管家，稳重踏实”，于是招来了42岁的米利亚姆·卢宝。\n\n卢宝面试的时候盖茨在出差。所以他们一开始没见过面。一天，这位助理急匆匆的跑进她上司的办公室说：有个小鬼刚才进了盖茨的办公室，在里面玩电脑。他的上司告诉她：那个小鬼就是盖茨。\n\n随着业务的拓展，盖茨要经常的出差。他有个习惯是尽可能晚的去机场，多半是飞机关门前几分钟才赶到。这就是他做事的方式：把事情推向极致。“我不是那种会提前一个小时就到机场的人，那是浪费时间。”盖茨真的是非常珍惜时间，就连用电脑打字的时候都不做拼写检查，对语法也不太在意，“it’s”\n\n写成“its”，只因为不想花时间在这些小事情上。\n\n \n\n那两年微软赚了不少钱，盖茨就买了一辆保时捷911。有很多心灵鸡汤说盖茨多么多么节俭，很显然，他把省下来的钱都用来买跑车了。盖茨喜欢开快车，没少收到交警的罚单。他助理的工作之一就是帮他交罚单。有一次警察还跟踪了盖茨，因为他们怀疑他是毒贩。警察很难相信这么年轻的人就买得起保时捷，钱包里还塞满了现金。\n\n \n\n（盖茨当年的保时捷）\n\n有一次盖茨去机场接一位日本客户，送到微软办公室的时候，“他脸都白了”，艾伦说，“他问我：盖茨先生开车都是这么快的吗？”\n\n还有一次他还借了朋友的一辆保时捷来开，结果把人家的车给弄坏了。坏到什么程度？光修车就修了一年。\n\n \n\n好胜的盖茨连开车都想分出胜负，他和艾伦有时候会比赛看谁能先到目的地。“当盖茨开车的时候，他总想测出它的极限在哪里”艾伦说。另一位员工Wood说“我一直觉得迟早有一天，我们会接到电话，叫我们去监狱里把他(盖茨)保释出来”。\n\n在微软，盖茨也是拼命三郎。他曾说，在他二十岁三十岁的时候，他从来没有休过假，每天都在工作，“没有度假，周末也加班，总是第一个到公司，最后一个离开，甚至常常在公司里睡觉。”这说法可能有些夸张，估计可以相信70%。\n\n他有时候会睡在公司倒是真的。有一次Roberts陪同别人参观MITS的时候，看到有个人躺在地上睡着了，那个人是盖茨。\n\n他的助理也曾遇到过相同的事情。有一次来到公司后，她发先桌子底下有个人在睡觉，在想着要不要叫保安时，发现那是盖茨。\n\n盖茨还把对自己的要求用来要求别人。他会在周末的时候去停车场看看，谁来公司加班了。后来公司变得越来越大，人越来越多，盖茨就不这么做了（是因为车牌太多了记不住了吗？）\n\n盖茨在哈佛的一个同学，Bob Greenberg，后来加入了微软。有一次在四天里工作了81个小时，盖茨过去问他：明天你打算做哪部分？\n\nBob说：明天我打算休息。\n\n盖茨疑惑的问：为什么需要休息？\n\n \n\n（工作中的盖茨）\n\n \n\n \n\n高要求的盖茨在管理上也有自己的一套。有一次一位同事被客户投诉，那时候还是写纸质的投诉信。盖茨会把那封信拿到那个员工面前，先是盯着那封信，然后盯着员工，然后又盯着那封信，然后又盯员工，最后转身走掉了。整个过程一言不发。“我不会开掉那位员工，只要他能弥补自己的过错。”\n\n \n\n这时的盖茨依然邋里邋遢，卫生情况有点糟糕。他也不管不顾，眼镜有时都很脏了，也不擦，他的同事一度怀疑，那么脏，能看得见吗？\n\n \n\n看到软件这个行业前景的人，不只是盖茨他们，还有其他人。\n\n1977年，Dan Bricklin和Bob Frankston研发了VisiCalc电子表格软件。1979年，他们成立了Personal Software公司，将Visicalc与苹果II电脑捆绑销售，成为了第一款流行的个人电脑商业软件。\n\n1978年9月, MicroPro公司成立，这家公司推出了文字处理软件：WordStar,第一个个人电脑上的文字处理软件。\n\n这两款软件打开了新的市场。野心勃勃的盖茨，不满足于自己的一亩三分地，暗下决心开发自己的文字处理软件和电子表格软件。一副“我全部都要”的架势。\n\n1978年微软开始了国际化进程，开设了日本办事处。\n\n \n\n（艾伦与盖茨在日本）\n\n \n\n1979年，他们决定把公司搬到西雅图。微软也是少有的总部不在硅谷的IT公司。\n\n另一家总部在西雅图的IT 巨头是亚马逊。\n\n搬家之前，微软的十一名员工拍了张合照，这张照片后来还登上了时代周刊，新闻周刊，财富杂志的封面。\n\n \n\n \n\n(40年后再聚首)\n\n \n\n也是79年，盖茨把大学同学视购物大师\n\n鲍尔默招进微软。\n\n \n\n（盖茨与鲍尔默）",

8800)的机器，宣称它是第一台个人计算机。计算机虽然早就出现了，可是由于技术的限制，当时的计算机体积还比较庞大，价格也是不菲，，不是人人都能拥有的只有大机构才能配备。\n\n而这台牵牛星8800价格十分便宜，不到500美金。而且这台机器还具备拓展能力，用户可以根据自己的需要添加设备。\n\n \n\n(当年的大众电子杂志以及牵牛星8800)\n\n \n\n艾伦读了这篇文章后，马上找到了盖茨。他们觉得千载难逢的机会就在眼前。\n\n这台牵牛星8800的功能十分有限，只是一台粗糙的计算机，基本上你什么都做不了，没有键盘，没有软件，只能拨弄一些开关，然后开开灯泡这类的。\n\n盖茨觉得他们可以给这台机器开发一个解释器，这样就可以在上面开发些软件了。于是他们给开发了牵牛星8800的MITS公司主席Ed Roberts写了封信，说他们给牵牛星8800写了一个BASIC解释器，问MITS有没有兴趣合作。\n\nMITS给盖茨回了一封信，不过这封信寄却到了盖茨西雅图的家里，他那时候在哈佛，盖茨就没受到那封信。等了一段时间，盖茨他们看到MITS没回应，就想该怎么办。他们想要不主动联系一下吧，这次别写信了直接打电话吧。但是他们都想让对方去打电话，因为他们都有点害怕。最后，他们想出一个办法，由盖茨来打电话，他对生意的事情比较懂，但是盖茨要假装自己是艾伦，因为艾伦看起来更老成一些，他们不想让对方知道自己是个乳臭未干的学生。电话通了之后，盖茨说他和他的朋友正在为这台机器开发BASIC，而且快完成了，MITS有没有兴趣合作。不过实际上，盖茨他们连一台牵牛星8800都没有(他们只在那本杂志的封面上见过那台计算机)，也没有为这台机器写过什么代码，他们只是想看看MITS有没有兴趣。Roberts在电话那头说：“真的吗？已经有50个人跟我们说他们开发了BASIC了。但是他们什么都没做出来。谁第一个做出来，我就跟谁合作。 ”\n\n \n\n接下来的几周盖茨和艾伦疯狂的编程。艾伦开发出一个牵牛星的模拟器，盖茨则扑在BASIC上。开发完成之后，他们决定由艾伦去跟MITS碰面。出发前一天晚上，艾伦去休息了，盖茨则通宵查bug。第二天在飞机上，艾伦突然发现他们漏了点东西：引导加载程序(bootstrap loader)。有了这个程序计算机才能知道怎么把数据读入内存。当时距离飞机降落时间已经不多了。没有办法，艾伦就在飞机上写了一个。\n\n那之前，他们的软件都没真正的测试过。\n\n好在最后在MITS的演示很成功，Roberts很满意。双方决定合作。盖茨和艾伦授权MITS使用他们的BASIC。艾伦回到波士顿与盖茨一起庆祝，去吃了冰淇淋和软饮料。(说个小插曲，艾伦到了MITS那边的时候，Roberts带他去一家酒店落脚。艾伦当时没有足够的钱，只能很不好意思地跟Roberts借。)\n\n \n\n随后艾伦进入MITS工作，担任软件开发部门负责人，其实整个部门就他一个人。\n\n不久盖茨也跟了过去。艾伦给他们的公司起名叫做：Micro-Soft。没多久，他们把中间的横杠去掉了，MicroSoft正式登上历史舞台。\n\n \n\n盖茨觉得这可是千年等一回的机会，于是想从哈佛退学，全心投入自己的事业。他的父母还是强烈反对，他们都希望盖茨能拿个大学文凭。盖茨的母亲找来一位朋友：Samuel，希望Samuel能说服自己的儿子别退学。\n\nSamuel是个白手起家的百万富翁，没上过大学，二战后开了家公司，由此发迹。他是当时西雅图少有的懂计算机的企业家。\n\n \n\n一天Samuel跟盖茨去一家餐厅吃了午餐，席间盖茨不停的说着他的计划，以及当时计算机行业即将发生的变革。听完之后，Samuel被眼前这个年轻人的激情感动了，似乎看到了年轻时的自己，最后不仅没劝盖茨别退学，反而鼓励他去创业。“我当时犯了一个严重的错误，没有开一张支票，让盖茨填好数字。”(意即给盖茨投资)多年后，Samuel半开玩笑的说道。\n\n事已至此，盖茨的父母也没有办法了。盖茨终于从哈佛退学。\n\n成立了微软之后，盖茨和艾伦谈到了分配股权的问题。一开始艾伦觉得会是平分，但是盖茨觉得不对，他认为艾伦的贡献没有他的大，他提议他占60%，艾伦拿40%。艾伦同意了。\n\n有一天，盖茨约艾伦出去走走。不一会，他说：你看老哥，活基本都是我干的，而且我从哈佛退学，放弃了很多东西，我觉得我应该占更多的股份。\n\n艾伦问：你觉得你要占多少？\n\n盖茨说：64 ：36。\n\n经过一番思想斗争，艾伦还是同意了。\n\n \n\n（早年的盖茨与艾伦）\n\n \n\n（1975年的盖茨）\n\n \n\n很早以前艾伦就跟盖茨设想将来计算机会大有前途，而不仅仅只是爱好者手中的玩具，计算机应该进入千家万户。一开始跟MITS合作的时候，他们就清楚的知道，不能只依赖MITS这一家公司，他们的软件应该可以用在所有的机器上。在跟MITS签署的协议上就确保了微软能把他们的软件授权给其它公司。\n\n牵牛星8800在美国的计算机爱好者圈子里引起了不小的反响。受此影响的就包括乔布斯和[沃兹尼亚克](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B2%83%E5%85%B9%E5%B0%BC%E4%BA%9A%E5%85%8B)，这两位联手创办了苹果电脑公司，成就了另一段传奇。\n\n牵牛星给微软带来的收入却不多。因为牵牛星上使用BASIC的人大概只有十分之一的人真的付了钱。这些人都自视为GEEK，他们认为信息不应该有版权，而是应该自由分享。然而盖茨却不这么看。\n\n盖茨给这些爱好者们写了封公开信，信中指责他们这种行为为“偷窃”，他认为软件跟硬件一样，都要出钱买。“不能赚钱谁还会去开发软件？”\n\n \n\n（当年的公开信原件）\n\n \n\n这封信并没起到多大效果。看来美帝人民在盗版面前跟天朝人民是一样的。此路不通那就只能另寻他法。后来盖茨终于想到：把软件卖给硬件厂家，然后厂家把成本加到电脑上去。这样他们只需要跟硬件商收钱而不用管盗版的问题了。\n\n艾伦连连拍手称秒，“高，实在是高！”。\n\n \n\n(盖茨与艾伦)\n\n \n\n1977年，有其它的厂家加入了计算机行业，市面上涌现除出其它的计算机，比较有代表性的是：TRS-80,苹果II,PET。这些电脑各有特点，但有一个共同点：后来都安装了微软的BASIC。刚开始这三家公司用的都是自家的BASIC，但是质量平平，最后不得不找到掌握了核心科技的盖茨，为他们开发 BASIC。随着计算机行业的发展，微软的生意也水涨船高。\n\n事情也有不顺利的时候。盖茨跟MITS的Roberts就对不上眼，两人经常吵架。别看年轻的盖茨长着一张娃娃脸，笑起来人畜无害似的，却是个暴脾气，他们对软件开发和商业方向的问题上有很大分歧，Roberts觉得盖茨令人讨厌。而且有时候他们会在与计算机无关的问题上争执不休。比如美国应不应该对日本投放原子弹。到最后像是为了争论而争论。\n\n1977年，乔布斯和[沃兹尼亚克](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%96%AF%E8%92%82%E5%A4%AB%C2%B7%E6%B2%83%E5%85%B9%E5%B0%BC%E4%BA%9A%E5%85%8B)推出的苹果II电脑，集成了显示器，键盘，用户不需要自己再去额外配置这些东西。一上市便大受欢迎。苹果II真正的引爆了计算机革命。（再说一句，苹果一开始用的是[沃兹尼亚克](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%96%AF%E8%92%82%E5%A4%AB%C2%B7%E6%B2%83%E5%85%B9%E5%B0%BC%E4%BA%9A%E5%85%8B)写的BASIC，但是最后由于种种原因，乔布斯还是找来盖茨，为苹果II开发BASIC，看来盖茨的编程功力十分了得）\n\n \n\n \n\n（苹果II电脑）\n\n苹果凭借苹果II开始崛起，MITS则步履维艰，公司每况愈下。1977年， Roberts不得不把MITS卖给了另一家电脑公司，回到乔治亚，进入一所医学院读书，后来当了一名医生。多年后谈起盖茨心中依然五味杂陈。\n\n \n\n好在盖茨他们早有准备，MITS的失败对他们影响不大。\n\n正如前面所说，当年其它男孩子还在读Playboy的时候，盖茨就经常阅读商业书籍。所以盖茨对商业的事务有些了解。这时这些商业知识就派上了用场。盖茨既写代码，又做销售，连法律事务也能分担部分。每天出去拉业务，还真给他拉来了不少。\n\n随之而来的问题就是人手不够了。\n\n1977年他们招了一位42岁的助理。在那之前，他们招了一位年轻漂亮的助理，那助理却不喜欢这乱糟糟的工作环境，以及暴脾气的小鬼：盖茨。没两天就辞职不干了。盖茨觉得他们要找的“不是一个花瓶，而是热心肠，事无巨细的管家，稳重踏实”，于是招来了42岁的米利亚姆·卢宝。\n\n卢宝面试的时候盖茨在出差。所以他们一开始没见过面。一天，这位助理急匆匆的跑进她上司的办公室说：有个小鬼刚才进了盖茨的办公室，在里面玩电脑。他的上司告诉她：那个小鬼就是盖茨。\n\n随着业务的拓展，盖茨要经常的出差。他有个习惯是尽可能晚的去机场，多半是飞机关门前几分钟才赶到。这就是他做事的方式：把事情推向极致。“我不是那种会提前一个小时就到机场的人，那是浪费时间。”盖茨真的是非常珍惜时间，就连用电脑打字的时候都不做拼写检查，对语法也不太在意，“it’s”\n\n写成“its”，只因为不想花时间在这些小事情上。\n\n \n\n那两年微软赚了不少钱，盖茨就买了一辆保时捷911。有很多心灵鸡汤说盖茨多么多么节俭，很显然，他把省下来的钱都用来买跑车了。盖茨喜欢开快车，没少收到交警的罚单。他助理的工作之一就是帮他交罚单。有一次警察还跟踪了盖茨，因为他们怀疑他是毒贩。警察很难相信这么年轻的人就买得起保时捷，钱包里还塞满了现金。\n\n \n\n（盖茨当年的保时捷）\n\n有一次盖茨去机场接一位日本客户，送到微软办公室的时候，“他脸都白了”，艾伦说，“他问我：盖茨先生开车都是这么快的吗？”\n\n还有一次他还借了朋友的一辆保时捷来开，结果把人家的车给弄坏了。坏到什么程度？光修车就修了一年。\n\n \n\n好胜的盖茨连开车都想分出胜负，他和艾伦有时候会比赛看谁能先到目的地。“当盖茨开车的时候，他总想测出它的极限在哪里”艾伦说。另一位员工Wood说“我一直觉得迟早有一天，我们会接到电话，叫我们去监狱里把他(盖茨)保释出来”。\n\n在微软，盖茨也是拼命三郎。他曾说，在他二十岁三十岁的时候，他从来没有休过假，每天都在工作，“没有度假，周末也加班，总是第一个到公司，最后一个离开，甚至常常在公司里睡觉。”这说法可能有些夸张，估计可以相信70%。\n\n他有时候会睡在公司倒是真的。有一次Roberts陪同别人参观MITS的时候，看到有个人躺在地上睡着了，那个人是盖茨。\n\n他的助理也曾遇到过相同的事情。有一次来到公司后，她发先桌子底下有个人在睡觉，在想着要不要叫保安时，发现那是盖茨。\n\n盖茨还把对自己的要求用来要求别人。他会在周末的时候去停车场看看，谁来公司加班了。后来公司变得越来越大，人越来越多，盖茨就不这么做了（是因为车牌太多了记不住了吗？）\n\n盖茨在哈佛的一个同学，Bob Greenberg，后来加入了微软。有一次在四天里工作了81个小时，盖茨过去问他：明天你打算做哪部分？\n\nBob说：明天我打算休息。\n\n盖茨疑惑的问：为什么需要休息？\n\n \n\n（工作中的盖茨）\n\n \n\n \n\n高要求的盖茨在管理上也有自己的一套。有一次一位同事被客户投诉，那时候还是写纸质的投诉信。盖茨会把那封信拿到那个员工面前，先是盯着那封信，然后盯着员工，然后又盯着那封信，然后又盯员工，最后转身走掉了。整个过程一言不发。“我不会开掉那位员工，只要他能弥补自己的过错。”\n\n \n\n这时的盖茨依然邋里邋遢，卫生情况有点糟糕。他也不管不顾，眼镜有时都很脏了，也不擦，他的同事一度怀疑，那么脏，能看得见吗？\n\n \n\n看到软件这个行业前景的人，不只是盖茨他们，还有其他人。\n\n1977年，Dan Bricklin和Bob Frankston研发了VisiCalc电子表格软件。1979年，他们成立了Personal Software公司，将Visicalc与苹果II电脑捆绑销售，成为了第一款流行的个人电脑商业软件。\n\n1978年9月, MicroPro公司成立，这家公司推出了文字处理软件：WordStar,第一个个人电脑上的文字处理软件。\n\n这两款软件打开了新的市场。野心勃勃的盖茨，不满足于自己的一亩三分地，暗下决心开发自己的文字处理软件和电子表格软件。一副“我全部都要”的架势。\n\n1978年微软开始了国际化进程，开设了日本办事处。\n\n \n\n（艾伦与盖茨在日本）\n\n \n\n1979年，他们决定把公司搬到西雅图。微软也是少有的总部不在硅谷的IT公司。\n\n另一家总部在西雅图的IT 巨头是亚马逊。\n\n搬家之前，微软的十一名员工拍了张合照，这张照片后来还登上了时代周刊，新闻周刊，财富杂志的封面。\n\n \n\n \n\n(40年后再聚首)\n\n \n\n也是79年，盖茨把大学同学视购物大师\n\n鲍尔默招进微软。\n\n \n\n（盖茨与鲍尔默）",

{"id": "mEnL_eJr4tl9j_MrxZeDQUkCClReESguNjaz4F0Nhak", "title": "对于HOP女巫攻击的思考", "body": "* 今天下午看了HOP创始人 [@WhinfreyChris](https://twitter.com/WhinfreyChris) 对于识别女巫的方法，同时晚上看了律动关于HOP的文章，有一些思考。\n* 1. 首先是一个地址交互结束之后将资金转入下一个地址，以这种方式使自己的地址交互完成，这种女巫攻击的方式可以轻松识别。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GFPitTLY5qEq0mferkeuu.png?height=275&width=691)\n\n他的鉴别方式也简单粗暴，首先找到了最初的地址，接着检测资金的转出，就顺着找下去了。\n\n![代码](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7f1kpgc_d-Ozv_4W0GgoT.png?height=860&width=1652)\n\n所以要尽量使用这种资金转移方式，可以使用CEX的子账户，ftx可以创建50个子账户，每个子账户提币地址不相同，而且一般的项目方是会把cex地址排除在外的。\n\n* 2. 第二种就是不在arb或者主网进行资金归集，在侧链或者其他二层进行归集。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dzbYfl9U8ZeGKaX9xkq0B.png?height=488&width=1004)\n\n这种其实就带有侥幸心理，一般情况下项目方不会查那么细致，不过hop就有点变态了，某些女巫猎人更变态，所以，不要想着跨到别的链上进行归集。或者用wormhole到solana进行归集，万一女巫猎人去solana查女巫呢。\n\n所以尽量使用cex，或者一些隐私dapp。\n\n* 3. 第三种猎人查询女巫的方式就是解析tx，不只是转账，只要你产生了tx，他们就会查询到你。\n\n  比如你使用某合约交互之后，打个比方（uniswap），你用A地址的eth去买usdc，买之后的usdc可以直接发送到B地址（你的归集资金的地址）。这个交易在etherscan上是看不出来的，但是点进tx里是可以观察到的。所以，不要使用这种合约开源的，没有隐私保护的工具进行资金归集以及转账。\n* 4. 最后，我在hop创始人推特下面看到一个评论，就是项目方如何判断那些从cex转出的资金是否为女巫地址呢。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zaZgXRtQ3GTdXw-z8RErN.png?height=1044&width=1068)\n\n也就是说，虽然从cex转出的资金无法被轻易定义为女巫，但是一般撸空投的人都是流水线操作，他们的操作顺序，操作金额，以及gaslimt和gasprice都基本相同。所以，如果碰到比较变态的项目方还是能抓到女巫的。另外，万一项目方结合机器学习呢？所以我们操作尽量不要相同，金额也尽量不要一样。\n\n## 最后再说一下使用隐私dapp\n\n1. 首先是 [@TornadoCash](https://twitter.com/TornadoCash)，使用零知识证明的隐私保护的项目，这个不用多说，保护得很好，很多黑客和跑路项目方都在使用。具体的使用方法很简单，存钱进去，他会给你个凭证，你可以用这个凭证去领钱，两个地址之间毫无关联，可以说几乎不可能找到与你关联的地址。\n2. 另外，最近有很多大v推另一款隐私产品 [@UmbraCash](https://twitter.com/UmbraCash)，但是说实话，它并不能很好的保护隐私，实际在解析tx时我们很轻松就能知道是哪个地址给哪个地址发送的代币。\n\n   随便以链上一条tx为例\n\n   0xe5854e81c96ce0a80dcb3c626acea799b79fb6166ebbf449550879b57be39a0b\n\n这条哈希就是umbra的发送资金的方法\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rhp7yWOHedwsJbiGBl-UJ.png?height=1030&width=2112)\n\n可以观察到，receiver地址暴漏在了tx inputdata里，所以完全知道是从哪里发送到哪里。红框是一个中继地址，可以理解为tornado的混币池。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/65eIV9ESOsYtM6sL_EqW_.png?height=765&width=2197)\n\n可以看到从中继地址有一笔资金转移，那就没错了，那个接收地址就是另一个钱包。所以，umbra没办法防范猎人。\n\n## 总结\n\n* 不要在主网和其他侧链进行代币转移。\n* 尽量将自己的行为错开。\n* 善用混币器，以及交易所子钱包\n\n  这是我的第一篇mirror，本来想写点感悟，结果一口气写了好多，和写论文一样，我本来是个一级玩土狗的科学家，行情太差于是来探索区块链，最近体验了很多项目。（嗯，比土狗有意思多了，代码也很有意思）以后多分享一下高质量的内容。                                                                                            ", "timestamp": 1653397938, "digest": "nyGLQm5KxJy1UcifxgzWyovo5PoQ_LnMiuncGzJU3Js", "contributor": "0x856E20356271611C4102c962389abefe0Dd9bB6E"}

Después, podrá mover dinero dentro o fuera de la criptografía según sea necesario, por lo que preparar su primera cuenta de intercambio es definitivamente una experiencia fundamental importante.\n\n*   Las lecciones y cuestionarios de Coinbase Earn son materiales de nivel principiante; están diseñados para personas que tienen poca o ninguna familiaridad con el espacio blockchain. Completar estos materiales es divertido y conduce a una comprensión básica de los conceptos criptográficos centrales. \n\n    Completar todos los cuestionarios actualmente disponibles de Coinbase Earn generará \\~ $ 90 USD en recompensas. ¡Tu primera criptomoneda! Con su cuenta de Coinbase, puede intercambiar estas recompensas y consolidarlas en otros activos criptográficos de su elección: BTC, ETH, MATIC, etc. Por ejemplo, \\~ $ 90 negociados en MATIC es más que suficiente para comenzar con NFT en Polygon de una manera de bajo costo.\n\nEn cuanto a cómo usar realmente Coinbase Earn, dirígete al [Panel de control Earn](http://coinbase.com/join/castao\\_7jp?src=ios-link) o haga clic en el botón \"Aprender y ganar\" en el lado izquierdo del sitio web de Coinbase.\n\nDesde aquí, podrá tomar lecciones cortas sobre proyectos criptográficos, simplemente presione el botón \"Iniciar lección\" en cualquier proyecto que despierte su interés primero. Si lo hace, se iniciará automáticamente una serie de diapositivas educativas que presentan las ideas principales de la criptografía que ha seleccionado.\n\n¡Siempre que esté listo, puede hacer clic en el botón \"Tomar cuestionario\" para poner a prueba sus nuevos conocimientos!\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F310f8bf8-97bb-488d-ab99-26190a3721bb\\_578x915.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F310f8bf8-97bb-488d-ab99-26190a3721bb\\_578x915.png)\n\nTenga en cuenta que cada proyecto tiene múltiples lecciones y cuestionarios, generalmente tres cada uno. A medida que complete con éxito los cuestionarios, ganará recompensas denominadas en el token del proyecto en cuestión, por ejemplo, tokens FET como se muestra en la imagen a continuación.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a0d1fb6-ef84-4836-89c9-6413f267b7fc\\_507x519.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a0d1fb6-ef84-4836-89c9-6413f267b7fc\\_507x519.png)\n\nUna vez que haya terminado con todos los materiales de Earn, ¡habrá obtenido un sentido fundamental de los conceptos básicos de la criptografía y habrá ganado sus primeras tenencias sin tener que comprar nada!

Con este fin, recomiendo encarecidamente a los principiantes en criptografía que echen un vistazo a RabbitHole. \n\nEsto se debe a que RabbitHole es una plataforma que gamifica y recompensa las experiencias educativas curadas de Web3. Al usar RabbitHole, realiza actividades reales en torno a proyectos criptográficos reales, aprendiendo y, a partir de entonces, potencialmente ganando en el proceso.\n\nTenga en cuenta que necesitará una billetera Web3 (MetaMask o WalletConnect) para usar RabbitHole, así que configure una si aún no lo ha hecho. Una vez hecho esto, diríjase al [project’s app](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkEtyhCAQQE8zLC0-irhgkU2uYYG0SgbBgiaJc_owsYpqiv4A7y0GYUv50mcqSN5hxusEHeGnBECETGqBPHunBZVKjEIRp3vH1KCIL_OaAQ7jg8ZcgZzVBr8Y9Cm-J5ikbCC7Bsn5IqhQkxxBTGK0az_QfgInmQIq73dNdR7iAhq-IV8pAgl6RzzLQ3w8-Gdb5jy7bKz1uKcA3ba1XHn6EArxmlPOKWOKUyEp7XjnFj4waykfrHRKia68vl5r_V0fPT023pVqC5rl2S3pIFnX2E4IJSTcW8eZE6b4RvuvN7K57UeNHq8ZorEB3A2Nt7t_DfMGEXK7xs0GG3\\_PB6E4GyambshmpR-bSc4m0j7gUpuK2pr4DFDKH6NVhqo), ¡conecta tu billetera y estarás listo para comenzar!\n\nAhora depende de ti decidir con qué desafíos de habilidades quieres comenzar. Cada desafío que completes con éxito te otorga puntos de XP, y algunas actividades producen más puntos que otras. Estas actividades costarán gasolina, por lo que puede convertir sus recompensas de Coinbase Earn a ETH, MATIC, etc. para ayudar a cubrir estos gastos si lo desea. \n\nCada página de Habilidades albergará diferentes oportunidades, así como información clave y un enlace a la aplicación. Tenga en cuenta que al hacer clic en el botón \"Detalles\" como se muestra a continuación, lo llevará a un tutorial para esa actividad en particular, por lo que siempre tendrá guías en las que puede apoyarse en cada paso del camino.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84577cdf-4751-459b-8f81-f56bcd17ecd0\\_940x755.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84577cdf-4751-459b-8f81-f56bcd17ecd0\\_940x755.png)\n\nSimplemente firmarás transacciones para canjear los puntos xp que acumules, y subirás de nivel a medida que aprendas más y completes más desafíos; la idea es que los puntos que ganes te darán derecho a futuras recompensas (tal vez un airdrop??? 👀)\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b7bbd71-abf0-46f1-9b50-eee2242f6755\\_435x111.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b7bbd71-abf0-46f1-9b50-eee2242f6755\\_435x111.png)\n\nEn cuanto a ganar tokens directamente, puede hacerlo durante [RabbitHole quest campaña](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkEFywyAMRU8Tlh4QtkMWLLrpNTxgZJuGgAuirXP6kniGgRHSl_T-bAjXlA-9p0LsdU107Kgj_paARJhZLZgn77Tko5JXqZjTvRNqUMyXacmID-ODplyR7dUGPxvyKb4UYuRiYJtGB8OM8rb0AGKRiiNXfesAwvVKLeM511TnMc6o8QfzkSKyoDeivVzkxwU-2zH73mVjractBezWtf19VyxUmNfAAbgQCrgcOe-gczMMwloOgx2dUrIrz6\\_nUv-WS88fK3Sl2kJmvndzerCsa2wRYQmJtlax50QpvtDe-UY2tfdRo6djwmhsQHdC0-nd24ZpxYi5tXGTocbfwyAViOEm1AnZXOmvzUkQN9YWcKmporYm3gOW8g_lmYbl) como la semana [Matcha campaña](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkMmOrDAMRb-msgNlYAiLLHrzfgNlMJDukKDEvCrq6zvVSJavLPva1rEaYU35UkcqSD5pxusAFeFZAiBCJmeBPHunBB2kGIUkTnWOyV4SX-YlA-zaB4X5BHKcJnir0af4cbCBsp5sapLjIgT0phudYYu1YnRuGEdn9SSmob_v6tN5iBYU_Id8pQgkqA3xKA_x9eD_auwa7abb1\\_WuhQlprQI6x-adX425mjX5uDYuPWODGzRZG-NxSwGaZ9XmthOvOOWcMiY5FQOlLW-d5T0zhvLeDE5K0Zb393s5X8ujo_vK23Kagtr-tDbtJKsz1gqhhIRbnThywhQ_FP76FcJcdT-jx2uGqE0Ad_PBG_MfsXmFCLmucbPGiqrjvZCc9ROTN48KsBsrdM4mUh9wqbqiMjr-BCjlF84cl3M) a partir de diciembre de 2021.

{"id": "1UpWdmdoGCYAkuoyz7TatuD8WbnfT58vGjVuPutYME4", "title": "来，猫叔按摩一下！", "body": "# 来，猫叔按摩一下！\n\n当前的区块链资产市场，一片凄风苦雨。\n\n大量的 ICO 项目破发，连主流资产也有不小的跌幅。\n\n望着账户资产大幅缩水，是不是吃个饭加个鸡腿都有罪恶感？\n\n作为一个 2013 年开始进入市场的资深老韭菜，老猫知道很多人因为参与时机或者姿势不对，此刻正在备受煎熬，而市场上各种满天飞的负面消息，也像一根根针，不时刺痛着本已经脆弱的神经，如此的煎熬，何时到头？甚至有人找我说：猫叔，你能不能不负责任的跳个大神，告诉我何时行情能转暖？\n\n是时候给大家按摩一下受伤的心灵（身体？）了……\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HJk3SWuTchiofI6-m3Fy2.gif?height=298&width=600)\n\n**第一、为什么一直跌跌不休？**\n\n这种问题，怎么回答都是错的，但有一句话不会错：市场永远是对的！\n\n以比特币为例，按照人民币计价，本轮大牛市从 1500 左右启动，最高上涨到12万，最高上涨了 80 倍，即使现在跌到 52000 左右的价格，还有 35 倍的惊人涨幅，你说的市场跌跌不休？难道你只接受一个只能涨不能跌的市场？\n\n客观上说，比特币已经是一个经济奇迹，2015 年之前的比特币，只有一小撮人以“万八”为目标自嗨，而随着比特币市场的扩大，比特币的价格和市值都飙升到了各国政府无法忽视的程度，不管是接受还是监管，也不管是痛恨还是拒绝，比特币已经从一个小众玩具成为了一个不可忽视的经济形态，这本身已经是比特币的巨大成功。\n\n关于比特币最精妙的比喻，是李笑来的“抽水马桶”比喻，比特币就像抽水马桶，一旦被发明出来，只会是用的人越来越多，根本不可能再回到没有比特币之前的世界了。\n\n但是，为什么这次比特币跌了这么多？\n\n因为前面涨太多了啊？如果把比特币看成一种商品，哪怕是按照不靠谱的马教经济学原理来说，其价格也将围绕着价值波动，尽管使用比特币的人数在这两年正在大幅增长，但相比将其作为炒作标的的人数来说，增长还是滞后的，所以，在价格的泡沫出现滞后，回落到一个平衡于（甚至低于）市场需求合理的价格，是非常合理的，所以，比特币的下跌，正是说明了比特币是一个自由市场，具有自我调节功能。\n\n涨涨跌跌本是平常事，对于比特币这样可以长期看好的品种，最坏打算，也就是等到其价值被不断发现的未来，相信我，会比你想象得还要快！\n\n**第二、为什么一些小品种跌得更狠？**\n\n一句话回答：越大的泡泡，破起来越难看！\n\n就算是铁头老韭菜，也不得不承认，市场的泡沫确实太大，是个程序员，就敢开发区块链，是个项目，就敢发币，是个VC，就敢似懂非懂吹牛逼。\n\n无论如何，区块链行业目前依然是初级阶段，如果以手机行业相比，目前还是功能机时代，一旦安卓系统出来，之前各种花里胡哨的功能机真正有用的就只剩下了通话，区块链系统在将来，必然只是少数几个寡头平台系统的天下，那么多看起来想象无限的 XX 链，最终会变成平台系统中的一个小功能，随着平台级别系统的来临，各种功能链将成为历史，所以，市场上这两年发行的 ICO 项目，相当一部分必然会归零，如果把归零作为最终的目标，那么，现在那种看起来很狠的下跌，可能还是温柔的前奏呢！\n\n（此处按摩下手太重，对不起。）\n\n**第三、为什么这么多的媒体在黑这个行业里的人和事？**\n\n确实，这种现象在之前很少。\n\n那是因为之前这个行业里面的张三李四根本不入那些古典网媒的法眼。\n\n而现在，这个行业已经做大，这些古典网媒看在眼里，焦虑在心里，我擦，这么大的蛋糕，为啥我没分到一块，一定是你们不讲规矩偷吃了，以至于我没有机会，各种不服，伴随着羡慕嫉妒恨，偷偷跟着玩一把，还不小心烂在了自己手里，这什么鬼？所以，只能判断为这个行业黑幕重重，凭什么你们能赚钱，我却只能亏钱？\n\n另外，唱空这个行业，是“政治正确”的表现。\n\n什么叫“政治正确”？\n\n一个村里来了一个陌生人，突然一条狗叫了起来，于是，整个村子的狗都跟着叫了起来，此起彼伏，好不热闹。所有后面跟着叫的狗，并不知道叫的什么，但必须要叫，因为这就是政治正确。\n\n不过政治正确也有能力高低，有些写得还是不错的，对这个行业的混乱和问题研究得透彻，描述得准确，而有些文章，简直是不胡言乱语无法成文，全世界都知道《疯狂的以太坊背后是什么》这篇是我写的，谷歌一下第一条就是我的专栏，对不起，你不会用谷歌，百度也一样啊！就这么简单的事情，却把这篇文章生生的按到了李笑来身上。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AEjkRw4pG9qxRBx4HKZBw.jpg?height=2135&width=1080)\n\n我说这位灵魂写手，你能不能上点心？难道是放在我名下让我跳大神成功令你不爽，放在笑来名下却能佐证笑来对市场有影响能力？写文也要做点基本调查对不？说实话这种胡话连篇的写法，我还真学不来！\n\n**第四、这个市场还有希望吗？**\n\n请记住，我是那个在以太坊还是十名之外就判断以太坊将会达到 400 美金的老猫！\n\n我的判断是：\n\n这个市场未来大有希望！\n\n但是，两极分化会越来越严重。\n\n真正有价值的品种，将会涨破你的想象力，而大量的垃圾品种归零，也毫无悬念，如果圈子里的老人，可以想下 2013 年 时代 和 比特儿 上一堆各种名目繁多的山寨币，如今他们安在？\n\n比特币依然是强势品种，请不要忘记了，比特币是区块链世界一切的根基，它一共只有 2100 万个，目前已经挖出超过 1500 万个，剩下的还要挖 100 多年才能挖出来，每一枚比特币都无比珍贵，未来的世界里，将只有两种人，有比特币的和没比特币的，你现在还有资格做出选择。\n\n其他品种我不敢随便说，授人话柄没意思，万一古典网媒们给我套上个坐庄的名声我就哭笑不得了，大家自己判断吧。\n\n**第五、猫叔你现在在做什么？**\n\n猫叔没偷懒，但是正在做的事情不能全部都说出来，就说几句吧：\n\n1、投一些项目，基本上定位于行业的基础需求项目。\n\n2、参与一些项目，但以我现在的风格，如果这个项目不够我吹牛逼，我是不可能参与的。\n\n3、在东京筹办一个接受比特币支付的综合服务类公司，这个公司将与日本最著名的公司之一进行合作，这个公司旨在以比特币作为支付方式打破一切不便，为有比特币的人在日本过上非常有尊严的生活提供便利。（谁说比特币没有用？）\n\n4、构建一些项目，之前的 IPO，ICO，IEO，IFO 都没兴趣了，也不好玩，我将来玩个 IDO，没听说过吧？\n\nIDO 就是，我出钱，我发币，但是，不以任何形式售卖，只用来奖励给帮助我实现项目 idea 的人，以及在这个项目中参与并提供有效贡献的人，我希望用这个方式去解决一个巨大规模的难题，酷不酷？\n\n等我的好消息！\n\n摘自微信公众号 [猫说](http://javascript:void(0);) *2018-03-17 09:30*", "timestamp": 1653398064, "digest": "H_2zLBCNdNSPh3NEZO3T7T10pzAJ9oDDgvXjhUZvzGI", "contributor": "0x9F56c8C3146FE954382C9706e94B0D826f1F5F3a"}

Con este fin, recomiendo encarecidamente a los principiantes en criptografía que echen un vistazo a RabbitHole. \n\nEsto se debe a que RabbitHole es una plataforma que gamifica y recompensa las experiencias educativas curadas de Web3. Al usar RabbitHole, realiza actividades reales en torno a proyectos criptográficos reales, aprendiendo y, a partir de entonces, potencialmente ganando en el proceso.\n\nTenga en cuenta que necesitará una billetera Web3 (MetaMask o WalletConnect) para usar RabbitHole, así que configure una si aún no lo ha hecho. Una vez hecho esto, diríjase al [project’s app](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkEtyhCAQQE8zLC0-irhgkU2uYYG0SgbBgiaJc_owsYpqiv4A7y0GYUv50mcqSN5hxusEHeGnBECETGqBPHunBZVKjEIRp3vH1KCIL_OaAQ7jg8ZcgZzVBr8Y9Cm-J5ikbCC7Bsn5IqhQkxxBTGK0az_QfgInmQIq73dNdR7iAhq-IV8pAgl6RzzLQ3w8-Gdb5jy7bKz1uKcA3ba1XHn6EArxmlPOKWOKUyEp7XjnFj4waykfrHRKia68vl5r_V0fPT023pVqC5rl2S3pIFnX2E4IJSTcW8eZE6b4RvuvN7K57UeNHq8ZorEB3A2Nt7t_DfMGEXK7xs0GG3\\_PB6E4GyambshmpR-bSc4m0j7gUpuK2pr4DFDKH6NVhqo), ¡conecta tu billetera y estarás listo para comenzar!\n\nAhora depende de ti decidir con qué desafíos de habilidades quieres comenzar. Cada desafío que completes con éxito te otorga puntos de XP, y algunas actividades producen más puntos que otras. Estas actividades costarán gasolina, por lo que puede convertir sus recompensas de Coinbase Earn a ETH, MATIC, etc. para ayudar a cubrir estos gastos si lo desea. \n\nCada página de Habilidades albergará diferentes oportunidades, así como información clave y un enlace a la aplicación. Tenga en cuenta que al hacer clic en el botón \"Detalles\" como se muestra a continuación, lo llevará a un tutorial para esa actividad en particular, por lo que siempre tendrá guías en las que puede apoyarse en cada paso del camino.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84577cdf-4751-459b-8f81-f56bcd17ecd0\\_940x755.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84577cdf-4751-459b-8f81-f56bcd17ecd0\\_940x755.png)\n\nSimplemente firmarás transacciones para canjear los puntos xp que acumules, y subirás de nivel a medida que aprendas más y completes más desafíos; la idea es que los puntos que ganes te darán derecho a futuras recompensas (tal vez un airdrop??? 👀)\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b7bbd71-abf0-46f1-9b50-eee2242f6755\\_435x111.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b7bbd71-abf0-46f1-9b50-eee2242f6755\\_435x111.png)\n\nEn cuanto a ganar tokens directamente, puede hacerlo durante [RabbitHole quest campaña](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkEFywyAMRU8Tlh4QtkMWLLrpNTxgZJuGgAuirXP6kniGgRHSl_T-bAjXlA-9p0LsdU107Kgj_paARJhZLZgn77Tko5JXqZjTvRNqUMyXacmID-ODplyR7dUGPxvyKb4UYuRiYJtGB8OM8rb0AGKRiiNXfesAwvVKLeM511TnMc6o8QfzkSKyoDeivVzkxwU-2zH73mVjractBezWtf19VyxUmNfAAbgQCrgcOe-gczMMwloOgx2dUrIrz6\\_nUv-WS88fK3Sl2kJmvndzerCsa2wRYQmJtlax50QpvtDe-UY2tfdRo6djwmhsQHdC0-nd24ZpxYi5tXGTocbfwyAViOEm1AnZXOmvzUkQN9YWcKmporYm3gOW8g_lmYbl) como la semana [Matcha campaña](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkMmOrDAMRb-msgNlYAiLLHrzfgNlMJDukKDEvCrq6zvVSJavLPva1rEaYU35UkcqSD5pxusAFeFZAiBCJmeBPHunBB2kGIUkTnWOyV4SX-YlA-zaB4X5BHKcJnir0af4cbCBsp5sapLjIgT0phudYYu1YnRuGEdn9SSmob_v6tN5iBYU_Id8pQgkqA3xKA_x9eD_auwa7abb1\\_WuhQlprQI6x-adX425mjX5uDYuPWODGzRZG-NxSwGaZ9XmthOvOOWcMiY5FQOlLW-d5T0zhvLeDE5K0Zb393s5X8ujo_vK23Kagtr-tDbtJKsz1gqhhIRbnThywhQ_FP76FcJcdT-jx2uGqE0Ad_PBG_MfsXmFCLmucbPGiqrjvZCc9ROTN48KsBsrdM4mUh9wqbqiMjr-BCjlF84cl3M) a partir de diciembre de 2021.

Al momento de escribir, no hay misiones en vivo actualmente, pero van y vienen periódicamente, ¡así que mantén los ojos bien abiertos para encontrar oportunidades!\n\nTenga en cuenta que para desbloquear completamente su perfil de RabbitHole y acceder a las ganancias de su misión, deberá verificar su cuenta a través de BrightID ([tutorial aquí](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwl0EtPxCAQAOBfsxwbHn3QAwc3xph4MMaLnhoo0y0uhQpT3e6vl3UTwmSAmSHfqBFOMe1qjRnJbRtwX0EF-M0eECGRLUManFWCtlJ0QhKrastkI4nLw5QAFu28wrQBWTfj3ajRxXCrYC1lDZlLHK0Q0vaaMtvV9SSkkBN0rW5E3Xf2Pldv1kEYQcEPpD0GIF7NiGs-iIcDfyoraWMcztFDtbiUYqou-7Wcf76MAn16m5-O78vxODyHZb5-XLwUr-tjvcY4JXH-Xnp5isQpTjmnjElORUtpxSs78oYZQ3ljWiulqPL16zptl-lQ0-XEq7yZjHo8V2NcSFJbKBlC9hHn8mJNEWO4GfzfF4KhxGULDvcBgjYe7F0H78j_XsMJAqTSxg4aC1DNGyE5a3om7xqFr-4KOWc9KR-wsVQFZXQ4e8j5D4mdlaw)). Dicho esto, si está enfocado principalmente en aprender desde el principio, simplemente concentrarse en completar los desafíos de Habilidades básicos de RabbitHole y seguir los tutoriales provistos vale la pena en sí mismo y lo ayudará a convertirse en un veterano de Web3 en poco tiempo.\n\n## **Conclusión**\n\nA pesar del desempeño triunfal de la criptoeconomía en los últimos años, los que ya estamos aquí todavía tenemos mucho trabajo por delante cuando se trata de ayudar a las personas a empoderarse tangiblemente y mejorar sus vidas con innovaciones criptográficas. Es por eso que creo que el combo Coinbase Earn + RabbitHole es poderoso. Estos servicios juntos crean una introducción convincente a las aplicaciones criptográficas y criptográficas que hace que ingresar a este espacio sea fácil y, francamente, divertido. Es un programa simple y confiable de \"uno-dos golpes\" que puede ayudar a una amplia gama de personas a comenzar sus viajes criptográficos. ¡Esto es bueno y vale la pena recomendarlo!\n\n### **  Pasos de acción**\n\n*   Completa todas las lecciones de Coinbase Earn Completa al menos un desafío de habilidades en RabbitHole\n\n    #### *Biografía del autor*\n\n    *William M.

Or that their application as “PFPs” is just as likely to signal pathology as any kind of virtue, let alone sex appeal. And it’s not that that I don’t give a f\\*ck (I’m an mfer, sure, but I’m rarely a careless one). So why, then, in spite of all the bullshit that often seems to define crypto, is it that I nevertheless stand behind them? Why not join the many armies that oppose it all instead? They’re surely a more respectable bunch than the degens and shadowy supercoders and dodgy artists whom I’ve quietly come to adore so much. So why? Why, that is, am I such an mfer? If you’ll listen, I’ll tell you.\n\nI’m an mfer because I’m interested in whether we can’t, in this digital age of ours, build brands, and whole socioeconomic structures, in entirely novel ways. Ways that feel a little more, uh, digital.\n\nI’m an mfer because I believe that legitimate, self-sovereign, transnational digital property rights are a basic human liberty, and, at least partially, the key to unlocking a better digital future.\n\nI’m an mfer because I believe in an internet where the flow of value is intermediated by the institutions or networks we *believe* in, whose values we subscribe to.\n\nI’m an mfer because I believe in the right to assign and transfer value freely. If, for instance, we want to make regenerating the planet worth something, monetarily speaking, we should be free to do so, and able to use *all* the available tools at our disposal. (And, if we elect to hold a non-trivial percentage of our net worth in stick figure, that’s *our* -- arguably disconcerting -- prerogative all the same).\n\nI’m an mfer because I’d rather help build parallel, digitally-native institutions, from the ground up, than commit my life to salvaging institutions I scarcely believe in. If nothing else, I find the former vocation simply more interesting. (If it weren’t for the possibility of a radically better way of doing things, I’d probably live my life deep in the jungle -- it’s peaceful there).\n\nI’m an mfer because I believe that technology is a *possibility.* Of course, it never guarantees a better world, but it provides the chance.

{"id": "2myQnXwSPjabkwosZoiyDnrcbLdxf_EhhslO--JxFX4", "title": "泡菜证明初步之PLONK", "body": "原文地址：<https://eng-blog.o1labs.org/posts/plonk/> \n 作者：Anaïs Querol \n 翻译：MINA Holder\n\nKimchi 是我们新的无需信任的 zkSNARK，它基于[PLONK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953.pdf)证明系统和[Bulletproofs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf)承诺方案。这篇文章的目的是缓解阅读上述论文后产生的症状。毕竟，PLONK精心挑选的缩写（*Permutations over Lagrange-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive arguments of Knowledge*）绝不仅仅是一个有趣的巧合：让我们试着把一瓶 plonk（英式英语：廉价酒） 变成一杯美酒🍷，然后干杯🍻！\n\n## Kimchi\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GbMpFuaSs3J8-jHOoHqb8.png?height=340&width=340)\n\n通常，人们需要一些白菜、盐和香料来烹制自制泡菜。在 O(1) Labs，我们的Kimchi食谱略有不同：我们将使用以下三个论证系统来代替上述主要成分。\n\n**· 自定义门（Custom gates）**：这些是我们要品尝的香料。不同的配置（口味）将得到不同的Kimchi。更正式点说，根据我们想要证明的计算类型，我们将选择不同的自定义门来创建电路。\n\n**· 排列（Permutation）**：就像白菜一样，这是将泡菜的味道融合在一起的部分，它使泡菜成为一道菜，而不仅仅是一些不相交的简单成分。更正式点说，排列论证执行门之间的*连线*（即从输入和到输出的连接），表示执行迹（execution trace）中单元之间的复制约束（copy constraints）。\n\n**· 查找表（Lookup tables）**：再加点盐虽非必要，但会使结果脱颖而出。出于效率原因，我们可以使用查找表。一些公共信息（例如布尔函数）可以由双方（证明者和验证者）存储，而不是硬连线在电路中。\n\n所有这些论证系统都被翻译成等式，这些等式必须对整个关系的正确证据（witness）成立。等价地，就是说这些表达式需要在一组特定数上求值为零。在烹饪泡菜之前，我们应该确保我们知道所涉及的流程。所以这里有两个问题需要解决：\n\n**1.根检验 （Roots-check）**：确保各组分通过一些质量测试，正式说即查验方程在一组数上的求值为零。\n\n**2.聚合（Aggregate）**：检验**所有**成分，即每个方程都必须满足上述条件。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fXcx8DBfaO4qvQi6If5KA.png?height=340&width=340)\n\n下面，我们将使用符号F指代一个*有限域*。你可以将其理解为其中元素像钟表🕙一样运行的数学结构，意思是域中的最大元素会回绕到最小元素（类比12点和0点指向一个位置）这些域的一个我们关心的良好属性是这些域中的数字不能无限增长，它们总是会保持在一个范围内（称为域的*阶*）。而且，代数仍然成立（我们称之为*模代数*）。有一个小点要注意一下，有限域的阶必须是素数或素数的幂。所以让我们带上你的 13 小时计时器，开始制作泡菜吧！\n\n### 根检验\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EsUFTAP5eZdhGE-n01j5I.png?height=510&width=340)\n\n \n 对第一个问题，给定一个阶为d的多项式，要求对一个集合S（一系列数）中的所有元素x检验p(x)=0 。当然，你可以手动对集合中的所有元素求值，然后确保上述论断的正确。 但是那会花费太长时间（即不简洁）。反之，我们想要一次检验所有的方程。 一个很好的方法是通过使用**归零多项式**（vanishing polynomial）。这种多项式vS(X)不过是在S上求值为0的最小多项式，意即刚好由下列单项式乘积构成的阶为|S|的多项式： \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TptlcXd-h-CMpA5HULZAr.png?height=173&width=1587)\n\n为什么这个有用呢？ 首先我们需要做一个关键的观察。因为归零多项式在每一个x∈S上都等于0，且为满足该性质的最低阶多项式，如果我们的起始多项式p(X) 在S上求值为0，那么p(X) 一定是归零多项式vS(X)的*倍数*。但这在实践中意味着什么？ 通过多项式除法，这意味着存在一个次数为 d−|S|的**商多项式**，使得： \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/00m9nrDaDCteOpudj8jUb.png?height=171&width=1576)\n\n如果你能提供这样一个商多项式，你可以很容易地对一个随机数a∈F\\\\S（不能在集合中，否则会得到0/0）检查 q(a)=p(a)/vS(a) 是否成立，如果是那么以很高概率意味着实际上 p(X)=q(X)⋅vS(X)，即p(X) 在整个集合S上求值为0，注意这里我们只检查了一点！\n\n让我们更深入地了解这里发生的“魔法”。 首先，我们所说的“以很高概率”是什么意思呢？ 这足够好吗？ 这个问题的答案是：与你想要的一样好。\n\n首先我们来分析这个检验的数学。如果p(X)=q(X)⋅vS(X) 确实成立，那么对于任意可能的 a∈F\\\\S ，检验p(a)?=q(a)⋅vS(a)一定成立。但是否有任何不幸的点实例使得p(a)=q(a)⋅vS(a) ，但是p(X)≠q(X)⋅vS(X)呢？答案是，有这样的点，但，没有很多。但到底有多少呢？有多不可能呢？你已经知道这个的答案了：**Schwartz-Zippel**。回顾该引理：\n\n> 给定两个d阶不同的多项式f(X) 和g(X) ，他们至多相交于（*一致*于）d个点。或者等价地，另 h(X):=f(X)−g(X)，多项式h(X)可以至多在d个点求值为0（其根）。\n\n因此，如果我们令 p(X)→f(X)，q(X)⋅vS(X)→g(X)，阶都为 d，则有至多 d/|F−S|个不幸的点 a 可以诱使你认为 p(X) 是归零多项式的倍数（因此在所有 S 上的点都等于0）。那么，如何才能使这个错误概率可忽略呢？ 通过足够大的域大小（形式化定义是其大小的倒数应该比任何多项式表达式减小得更快）。 由于我们正在使用大小为 2^255的域，因此我们是安全的！\n\n其次，这真的比检查对所有 x∈S是否 p(x)=0 更快吗？ 归根结底，我们似乎需要求值 vS(a)，并且由于这是一个 |S|阶多项式，看起来我们仍在执行大约相同数量级的计算。 数学在这里又来救场了。 在实践中，我们希望将这个集合 S 定义为具有良好的结构，使我们能够比使用任意数的集合更有效地执行一些计算。 实际上，这个集合通常是一个**乘法群**（通常表示为 G或 H ），因为在这样的群中，归零多项式 ：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LKNZKRTOC3iaLo5lzjsjh.png?height=92&width=621)\n\n有一个有效的表示 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9xEIVyXMpF59EI47GIpeH.png?height=83&width=446)\n\n，这相比于上述乘积求值速度要快得多。\n\n第三，我们可能想了解对 p(a) 的求值会发生什么。由于这个阶 d≥|G|，看起来这也需要很多努力。但这就是密码学发挥作用的地方：验证者永远不会自己求值实际多项式有如下各种原因。第一，如果验证者可以访问完整的多项式 p(X)，那么证明者应该将该多项式与证明一起发送，这将需要 d+1个系数表示（对于一个SNARK来说这将不再简洁）。第二，这个多项式可能会携带一些秘密信息，如果验证者可以重新计算它的求值，他就可以通过在特定点求值来知道一些私有数据。因此，这些求值将只能成为“心理游戏”，这要归功于证明者发送的**多项式承诺**和**求值证明**（对他们来说，d数量级的计算不仅是可以接受的，而且是必要的）。实际证明长度将在很大程度上取决于我们使用的多项式承诺的类型。例如，在类Kate的承诺中，对多项式承诺会有常数数量的群元素（通常是一个），而在 Bulletproofs 中是对数个。但无论如何，这将比发送 O(d) 个元素要短。\n\n### 聚合\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D67Sc22EVCEbQ4-dYdBMa.png?height=451&width=340)\n\n \n 到目前为止，我们已经看到了如何只需一个点来检验在所有 G上多项式是否等于 0。 这在某种程度上本身就是一种聚合。 但是对于多个多项式，我们要分析如何来证明这件事。 总而言之，如果它们成立，这将意味着多项式编码了一个正确的证据，且关系将得到满足。 这些检查可以一个一个地执行（检查每个商是否确实正确），或者使用有效的聚合机制并一次只检查*一个更长的方程*。\n\n那么，执行这个一次性检查的最简单方法是什么？ 也许有人可以想到将所有方程 p0(X),…,pn(X) 加起来成为更长的方程 \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mWu6U520Vv6joC3irbUY3.png?height=160&width=500)\n\n。 但是这样做会使得有些项相互之间抵消，从而可能会得到一个不正确的陈述。\n\n因此相反，我们可以将求和中的每个项乘以一个随机数。 这个技巧起作用的原因是随机数之间的独立性。 也就是说，如果两个不同的多项式 f(X)和 g(X) 在给定的 X=x 上都等于 0，那么同样的 x以很大概率会成为随机组合α⋅f(x)+β⋅g(x)=0的一个根。 如果应用于整个语句，我们可以将 n 个方程转换为单个方程， \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iFxtIfUBTjF4zX6w_Edat.png?height=193&width=1112)\n\n到目前为止听起来都不错。 但是我们忘记了证明系统的一个重要部分，即证明长度。 为了使上述声明具有可靠性，用于聚合的随机值应该是验证者选择的，或者至少是独立于证明者的。 因此，如果验证者必须与证明者沟通以告知正在使用的随机值，我们将得到 n个域元素的开销。\n\n相反，我们可以使用另一种称为「**阿尔法之幂**」的技术。 在这里，我们假设一个随机值的幂 αi与实际的另一个随机值 ρi无法区分。 然后，我们可以将上述声明调整为仅使用一个与证明者协调一致的随机元素 α：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2ruOEn9lQwftca3uYu0tz.png?height=153&width=1117)\n\n## 门\n\n在上一节中，我们看到了如何非常有效地证明特定的方程在给定的数字集合上成立。 剩下要了解的是这些技术背后的动机。 为什么我们可以执行这些操作如此重要，这些方程在现实世界中代表什么？\n\n首先，让我们回顾一下这张总结了一些重要记号的表格：\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q77YEJyUkXdcjtRM8Il-d.png?height=472&width=2534)\n\n我们必须掌握的第一个想法是**电路**的概念。 一个电路可以被认为是一组用电线连接它们的门。 能想到的最简单的电路类型是布尔电路。 布尔电路只有二进制值：1 和 0，真和假。 从非常高的层次来看，布尔电路就像一个复杂的管道网络，其值可以被视为有水或无水。 然后，门将像旋塞阀一样，使水在管道之间流动或不流动。 然后，每一个反应都将表示为一个门（即逻辑门）。 可以有可以执行更多操作的电路，例如算术电路。 这里，可用的门类型将是算术运算（加法和乘法），线可以具有数值，可以执行任意计算。\n\n如果再动动脑筋，就可以构想出一个可以同时表示任何算术运算的“通用”门。 这种仔细构想的门就是在 Plonk 中使用其串联来描述任何关系的门。 除了线路之外，这些门还与一组有助于描述功能的**系数**相关联。但是这个门的问题在于它需要大量的该门来表示任何有意义的函数。 因此，最近出现了类 Plonk 的证明系统，它使用**自定义门**来更有效地表示重复使用的功能，而不是使用一系列相互连接的通用门。 Kimchi就是这些协议之一。 目前，我们支持如下操作的特定门：Poseidon 哈希函数、曲线点的 `CompleteAdd` 操作、变量基数乘法的 `VarBaseMul`、自同态变量基数标量乘法的 `EndoMulScalar` 以及 `ChaCha` 加密原语。\n\n电路结构是提前知道的，因为这是与验证者共享的公共信息的一部分。秘密的是我们称之为一个关系的**证据**，它是满足所有检验的电路的输入和线路的正确实例化。这意味着验证者知道电路的每个部分出现什么类型的门，以及附在每个部分的系数。\n\n门在矩阵中按行排列，列数根据需要加入（Plonk 需要 3列，而 Kimchi 目前使用 15列）。**执行迹**是指在证据实例化下整个电路中所有线路的状态。它将表示为一个表格，其中行对应于每个门，列指的是门的实际线路（也称为**输入和输出寄存器**）和计算所需的一些辅助值（也称为**建议寄存器**）。 Kimchi 的当前实现总共考虑了 15 列，前 7 列对应于 输入/输出寄存器。 排列论证作用于输入/输出寄存器（意思是，它将检查执行迹的前 7 列中的单元格是否正确复制到其目标单元格）。因此，这些检验也称为**复制约束**。\n\n> 令 3 个 Plonk 列的证据为 wL、wRwL、wR 和 wOwO，分别指左、右和输出。 与左、右、输出、乘法和标量的系数 cL、cR、cO、cM、cScL、cR、cO、cM、cS 一起，可以将通用算术运算表示为\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BbtKLp8n8r6zznqDoh7xt.png?height=95&width=1094)\n\n系数充当二元选择器，但标量系数可以是任何常数。例如，加法可以通过关闭乘法选择器 cM来表示。\n\n回到该方案的主要动机，回想一下，我们想检验特定方程在给定的一组数字集合中是否成立。以下就是这种声明开始有意义的地方。执行迹中的总行数将为我们提供一个**求值域**。也就是说，我们定义了执行迹的每个行索引和乘法群 G 的元素之间的映射，该乘法群的元素与表中的行一样多。这里需要注意两点。首先，如果不存在这样的群，我们可以用零填充。其次，任何乘法群都有一个生成元g，它的幂生成整个群。然后我们可以为每一行分配

Después, podrá mover dinero dentro o fuera de la criptografía según sea necesario, por lo que preparar su primera cuenta de intercambio es definitivamente una experiencia fundamental importante.\n\n*   Las lecciones y cuestionarios de Coinbase Earn son materiales de nivel principiante; están diseñados para personas que tienen poca o ninguna familiaridad con el espacio blockchain. Completar estos materiales es divertido y conduce a una comprensión básica de los conceptos criptográficos centrales. \n\n    Completar todos los cuestionarios actualmente disponibles de Coinbase Earn generará \\~ $ 90 USD en recompensas. ¡Tu primera criptomoneda! Con su cuenta de Coinbase, puede intercambiar estas recompensas y consolidarlas en otros activos criptográficos de su elección: BTC, ETH, MATIC, etc. Por ejemplo, \\~ $ 90 negociados en MATIC es más que suficiente para comenzar con NFT en Polygon de una manera de bajo costo.\n\nEn cuanto a cómo usar realmente Coinbase Earn, dirígete al [Panel de control Earn](http://coinbase.com/join/castao\\_7jp?src=ios-link) o haga clic en el botón \"Aprender y ganar\" en el lado izquierdo del sitio web de Coinbase.\n\nDesde aquí, podrá tomar lecciones cortas sobre proyectos criptográficos, simplemente presione el botón \"Iniciar lección\" en cualquier proyecto que despierte su interés primero.

Una vez hecho esto, diríjase al [project’s app](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkEtyhCAQQE8zLC0-irhgkU2uYYG0SgbBgiaJc_owsYpqiv4A7y0GYUv50mcqSN5hxusEHeGnBECETGqBPHunBZVKjEIRp3vH1KCIL_OaAQ7jg8ZcgZzVBr8Y9Cm-J5ikbCC7Bsn5IqhQkxxBTGK0az_QfgInmQIq73dNdR7iAhq-IV8pAgl6RzzLQ3w8-Gdb5jy7bKz1uKcA3ba1XHn6EArxmlPOKWOKUyEp7XjnFj4waykfrHRKia68vl5r_V0fPT023pVqC5rl2S3pIFnX2E4IJSTcW8eZE6b4RvuvN7K57UeNHq8ZorEB3A2Nt7t_DfMGEXK7xs0GG3\\_PB6E4GyambshmpR-bSc4m0j7gUpuK2pr4DFDKH6NVhqo), ¡conecta tu billetera y estarás listo para comenzar!\n\nAhora depende de ti decidir con qué desafíos de habilidades quieres comenzar. Cada desafío que completes con éxito te otorga puntos de XP, y algunas actividades producen más puntos que otras. Estas actividades costarán gasolina, por lo que puede convertir sus recompensas de Coinbase Earn a ETH, MATIC, etc. para ayudar a cubrir estos gastos si lo desea. \n\nCada página de Habilidades albergará diferentes oportunidades, así como información clave y un enlace a la aplicación. Tenga en cuenta que al hacer clic en el botón \"Detalles\" como se muestra a continuación, lo llevará a un tutorial para esa actividad en particular, por lo que siempre tendrá guías en las que puede apoyarse en cada paso del camino.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84577cdf-4751-459b-8f81-f56bcd17ecd0\\_940x755.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84577cdf-4751-459b-8f81-f56bcd17ecd0\\_940x755.png)\n\nSimplemente firmarás transacciones para canjear los puntos xp que acumules, y subirás de nivel a medida que aprendas más y completes más desafíos; la idea es que los puntos que ganes te darán derecho a futuras recompensas (tal vez un airdrop??? 👀)\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b7bbd71-abf0-46f1-9b50-eee2242f6755\\_435x111.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b7bbd71-abf0-46f1-9b50-eee2242f6755\\_435x111.png)\n\nEn cuanto a ganar tokens directamente, puede hacerlo durante [RabbitHole quest campaña](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkEFywyAMRU8Tlh4QtkMWLLrpNTxgZJuGgAuirXP6kniGgRHSl_T-bAjXlA-9p0LsdU107Kgj_paARJhZLZgn77Tko5JXqZjTvRNqUMyXacmID-ODplyR7dUGPxvyKb4UYuRiYJtGB8OM8rb0AGKRiiNXfesAwvVKLeM511TnMc6o8QfzkSKyoDeivVzkxwU-2zH73mVjractBezWtf19VyxUmNfAAbgQCrgcOe-gczMMwloOgx2dUrIrz6\\_nUv-WS88fK3Sl2kJmvndzerCsa2wRYQmJtlax50QpvtDe-UY2tfdRo6djwmhsQHdC0-nd24ZpxYi5tXGTocbfwyAViOEm1AnZXOmvzUkQN9YWcKmporYm3gOW8g_lmYbl) como la semana [Matcha campaña](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkMmOrDAMRb-msgNlYAiLLHrzfgNlMJDukKDEvCrq6zvVSJavLPva1rEaYU35UkcqSD5pxusAFeFZAiBCJmeBPHunBB2kGIUkTnWOyV4SX-YlA-zaB4X5BHKcJnir0af4cbCBsp5sapLjIgT0phudYYu1YnRuGEdn9SSmob_v6tN5iBYU_Id8pQgkqA3xKA_x9eD_auwa7abb1\\_WuhQlprQI6x-adX425mjX5uDYuPWODGzRZG-NxSwGaZ9XmthOvOOWcMiY5FQOlLW-d5T0zhvLeDE5K0Zb393s5X8ujo_vK23Kagtr-tDbtJKsz1gqhhIRbnThywhQ_FP76FcJcdT-jx2uGqE0Ad_PBG_MfsXmFCLmucbPGiqrjvZCc9ROTN48KsBsrdM4mUh9wqbqiMjr-BCjlF84cl3M) a partir de diciembre de 2021.

Gain additional NFT #TestTheMerge ", "body": "Hello frens, we have been testing the Merge to become eligible for the NFTs, and we have already seen [how to setup a simple smart contract](https://mirror.xyz/web3magnetic.eth/7eIC58eH8NVHuh_BjARMFJVzMMeLiwVBEuBLxlsVIME). If you are further interested in testing the merge, you can becoming a validator on Kiln testnet and claim another higher level NFT!\n\nSo lets hop right into this! This process is simple and requires just a few clicks, no coding or command line! 🎉\n\n### Ground Zero - You need 32 testnet ETH from a Faucet!\n\nTo setup a validator, you need a minimum of 32 ETH on the Kiln testnet. Currently, there are 2 faucets that can get you 32 ETH:\n\n1. [Kiln faucet from ethdevops.io](https://faucet.kiln.ethdevops.io/) - this is claimable only to a ENS domain. If you have an ENS, you can claim 32 ETH right away. \n2. A PoW mining faucet - [kiln-faucet.pk-net.net](http://kiln-faucet.pk-net.net/) - In this faucet, you need to PoW mine for a few hours to get 32 Kiln testnet eth. Using 24 workers, getting to 32 ETH would take roughly 4 hours. You can use this if you dont have an ENS. \n\nSo from the above 2 faucets, you can choose which works for you and get your 32 ETH. From the next step onwards, we will assume you have the 32 ETH and we will see how exactly to set up your validator deposit.\n\n### 1. First Steps.\n\nLet’s go to the [Kiln testnet homepage on Ethereum.org](https://kiln.launchpad.ethereum.org) (known as **Kiln Launchpad**) and here, click on “**Become a Validator**” option on top. You will be shown the best practices, steps, risks etc for your information. You can read these and click Continue/Accept in each section. Don’t worry if you dont understand using terminal, that is not required for just setting up a validator. \n\n![Understanding the steps to become a validator. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jlQkiwBBCFhkh1Uy9gRJD.jpg?height=1690&width=2110)\n\nOnce you finish all the screens and accept the steps, click on Continue. \n\n### 2. Choose Execution Client\n\nNow, you need to choose your execution client. \n\n![Choose your execution client](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FeT6t7UaHT2RYKCH4xEc6.jpg?height=1174&width=2122)\n\nFor simplicity purpose, just select Nethermind, and in the bottom of the page, select Continue. \n\n### 3. Choose Consensus Client\n\nNow, we have to choose consensus client. Again, for simplicity’s purpose, just choose Nimbus and select Continue from the bottom of the page. \n\n### 4. The next step is to create Key pairs. \n\nA Eth 2.0 staking key is a separate key that has to be created, in addition to your wallet’s key. For creating the key pair, you will download the software ”**Wagyu Key Gen app**” from GitHub based on your OS (win/mac/linux)\n\n![Select 1 validator - you are creating 1 validator which requires 32 ETH. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pWc-zMPsj0ErAFykuyKPe.jpg?height=1646&width=2134)\n\nThen choose your OS, and in the “Download Key Gen GUI app” tab, select the “Download from GitHub” link. You will be directed to GitHub to download the keygen file. \n\n![On GitHub, scroll to the bottom of the page till you reach Assets, and download the correct file based on your OS. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TmO3T10LBALId1AWhVVqQ.jpg?height=1036&width=1914)\n\nOnce you download the file, install it and run the file. \n\n![In this screen, select Kiln network. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NAgRUxtdrBIF-0BuZupAD.jpg?height=1356&width=1882)\n\nClick on “Create New Secret Recovery Phrase”. Click “Create” in the next screen to continue. The key generator will create a 24 word phrase, which you need to save in a secure location. Once saving the phrase, click on “Next”. You have to confirm you have saved the phrase. Paste the phrase again here to confirm, then click “Check”.\n\nIn the next screen, select no. of keys as 1, and enter a password. In the next screen, you will confirm the password. \n\nIn the next screen, you will create the  validator key files.  Click on “Browse” and choose a local location in your computer to save the file. For easy access, create a separate folder and select that location. \n\nFinally, click “Create”.\n\nThe Keys will be created, and saved in the location. Two files : **Keystore file** (ex. keystore-xxxxxxx.json) and **Deposit data file** (ex. deposit_data-xxxxxx.json) will be created. Keep these files securely. \n\nNow you can close the KeyGen app and return back to the Kiln Launchpad. In the bottom of the page where we downloaded the KeyGen, select the  “I am keeping my keys safe” checkbox, and click **“Continue”**.\n\n### 5. Upload Deposit Data\n\nIn this stage, you have to upload the deposit_data file created in the last step and saved in your local folder.\n\n![Drag or select that file, and click on Continue. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XJZwOBJEc-ApOqWsfye5c.jpg?height=1100&width=2158)\n\n### 6. Connect MetaMask wallet\n\nIn this stage, you need to connect to your Metamask wallet. Its preferable to not use a hardware wallet, and instead use a local Metamask wallet. \n\nOnce you select the wallet, the page will show you your wallet details. \n\n![if you have the required 32 ETH, you can select Continue](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bD5SJurhSmgIxfnduv_qn.jpg?height=908&width=2054)\n\nIn the next page, you will be shown the summary of your Launchpad staking, along with few disclaimers. \n\n![Make sure to select all the checkboxes and click Continue in the bottom of the page. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dEGTXai_itVahbMVifHz_.jpg?height=1470&width=2174)\n\n### 7. Submit the Transaction\n\nIn the final step, you will submit the deposit transaction. This page will show your selected key, status as “Ready” and the “Send Deposit” button. \n\n![Confirm deposit screen.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_Xc8pOpn7NMRwSQKxxQCO.jpg?height=1250&width=2106)\n\nOnce you click on the transaction, Metamask will popup and you can submit it just like a regular transaction. \n\n![You can see on the Metamask popup that the transaction is depositing 32 ETH into the staking contract. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VxPDSptkVOTqMT_i5Njqz.jpg?height=1376&width=942)\n\nNow, we will wait for the transaction to confirm. \n\n![Confirmation screen. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mG8glU5-EAmuQQpVm2Y72.jpg?height=1398&width=2118)\n\nOnce the transaction has confirmed, you can see the link to the transaction on beaconchain explorer. Click on “Continue”.\n\n![Successful completion screen!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QoEbH8gGWdi2JW-C0uAa0.jpg?height=1216&width=2156)\n\nThat is all! Your stake will take 2048 blocks to activate.

{"id": "okZCKH4G5T0HrIIxGqMivVSDIDVtMSiyGHpDmzqnW_M", "title": "zkSNARKs vs zkSTARKs: a primer", "body": "Trying out a longer form article this time to allow a deeper dive into some areas of blockchain research. There are a lot of articles on zero knowledge proofs, and a lot of research papers on SNARKs or STARKs, but very little bridging the intermediate gap.\n\nIf you haven’t read my introduction to zero knowledge proofs Twitter thread, I strongly recommend it before going further, as a lot of this article builds on top of it.\n\n[https://twitter.com/pseudotheos/status/1476380179966615557](https://twitter.com/pseudotheos/status/1476380179966615557)\n\nThe first introduction of a zero-knowledge proof was in a [1985 MIT paper](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf) (PDF warning) by Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali (who later founded [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/)).\n\nzkSNARKs and zkSTARKs are implementations of non-interactive zero knowledge proofs, which means that the prover does not need to disclose the data to the verifier. Non-interactive means that the prover only needs to send a single message to the verifier, instead of back-and-forth communication. This makes it possible for a blockchain to utilize ZK proofs, as blockchains are one-way. Once the block is produced, it is immutable.\n\nThere are two methods of zero-knowledge proofs that are currently being implemented with blockchain tech: zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs. In the Ethereum rollup space, there are two leaders: [zkSync](https://zksync.io/) is using zkSNARKs, and [StarkWare](https://starkware.co/) is using zkSTARKs. In addition to these two, there is [Loopring](https://loopring.io/), [Aztec](https://aztec.network/), [Polygon Hermez](https://hermez.io/) (SNARKs), [Polygon Miden](https://github.com/maticnetwork/miden) (STARKs), and many more. You can find a full list on [zkrollups.xyz](https://www.zkrollups.xyz/). Regardless of the implementation of SNARKs vs STARKs, all rollups solve the same problem and should be thought of less as competitors and more as collaborators both helping advance and scale Ethereum through different means.\n\n### Introducing zkSNARKs\n\nzkSNARK is an acronym: Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge. Stemming from a [2012 UC Berkeley paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2090236.2090263) by Alessandro Chiesa, zkSNARKs use elliptic curves to secure the randomness required for a proof.\n\nElliptic curves are collision resistant, which means that it is *very hard* to find two separate inputs that produce the same output. If you’re interested in learning more about how elliptic curves work in regards to cryptography, this video is a great introduction.\n\n[https://youtu.be/NF1pwjL9-DE](https://youtu.be/NF1pwjL9-DE)\n\nzkSNARKs were first introduced in blockchain by Zcash, a fork of Bitcoin. Because SNARKs have been around longer, they have a lot of documentation, tooling, and are easier to get into as a developer compared to STARKs. There are some downsides to existing implementations, such as no post-quantum resistance (a problem for the next decade) and initial trust requirements. Regardless of the downsides, SNARKs offer much more than optimistic rollups, as shown below.\n\n![source: Matter Labs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iUL7XrQR0EGnrcrnkGMZ2.png?height=1288&width=1364)\n\nOne issue with SNARKs is that they usually require a trusted setup. To mitigate the trust problem, zkSync has introduced a [universal trusted setup](https://blog.matter-labs.io/zksync-is-live-bringing-trustless-scalable-payments-to-ethereum-9c634b3e6823) for zkSync v1, which is much more secure compared to previous application-specific setups. Previous implementations required a lot more trust, as well as another setup for every future update of the protocol. Recently, [DARKs were introduced](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1229) ([and later modified for security](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/358)) which remove the need for a trusted setup. zkSync has been working on [Redshift](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1400), which solves both the trusted setup problem as well as provides post-quantum security. Once this has been properly reviewed and battle-tested, it will be implemented into zkSync.\n\n### zkSTARKs\n\nBeing much more recent, zkSTARKs have less tooling and developer support, but that is starting to change. [Introduced in 2018](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pdf) (PDF warning) by Eli Ben-Sasson, Iddo Bentov, Yinon Horeshy and Michael Riabzev, STARKs operate differently under the hood. zkSTARK is an acronym for Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge. The main difference between SNARKs and STARKs is that a STARK uses collision resistant hash functions instead of elliptic curves. There are some downsides to STARKs as well, mainly that proof sizes are much larger than a SNARK proof, and take longer to verify as well as cost more gas. This tradeoff is worth it, however, because the effective TPS and throughput ceiling is much higher than a SNARK.\n\nSTARKs are more scalable than SNARKs, and with [Validiums](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/validium/), which store data off-chain, the gas ceiling that developers have had to deal with on L1s is effectively gone. Here’s an example of a 3d model stored on a zkSTARK rollup, something that is impossible on a L1.\n\n[https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza/status/1477950243266527236](https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza/status/1477950243266527236)\n\n### Comparisons\n\nThe levels in the charts below refer to complexity of arithmetic circuits. Each level is roughly 55x more complex than the previous level. In these examples, the difficulty slope for zkSTARKs rises much slower than SNARKs. As TPS and throughput increase, so does complexity. Even though zkSNARKs are less scalable, they are still magnitudes more scalable than existing L1s. Right now, zkSync can manage 3000 TPS with the same security guarantees as a L1 Ethereum transaction. With zkPorter, zkSync’s [Validium](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/validium/) solution, it can settle 50,000+ TPS.\n\n![source: ZK-STARK whitepaper and Adam Luciano](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0rWxz2C9HSJEiY0HwMC4p.png?height=364&width=700)\n\n![source: ZK-STARK whitepaper and Adam Luciano](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZFbzyu-ghHgcUcmAsa1fa.png?height=413&width=696)\n\n![source: ZK-STARK whitepaper and Adam Luciano](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lLRuuSWDEqkLAibY2Rzoh.png?height=383&width=700)\n\n![source: Matter Labs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g_NFwArVbb4-loiJ5ptye.png?height=800&width=1354)\n\n### Beyond L2s\n\nScalability is very close to becoming infinite, which will open the doors to a truly trustless, fast, and low-cost application layer secured by Ethereum. StarkWare is working on [recursive STARKs known as L3s](https://medium.com/starkware/fractal-scaling-from-l2-to-l3-7fe238ecfb4f) which stretch scaling even further.\n\n![source: StarkWare](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GcJhFXvUFoAz3UHMhkSLj.png?height=421&width=700)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe zero knowledge space is still an area of active research, and there is still a lot of work to be done before we reach the [Endgame](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html), but the tech is advancing rapidly and moving away from the Layer 1 wars towards a rollup-centric future.\n\n*Thanks for reading this article!

{"id": "U1cQWjZK1f96d3F96O7IjAMrbHgfQ_xh_tSj68BrKYU", "title": "zkSNARKs vs zkSTARKs: a primer", "body": "Trying out a longer form article this time to allow a deeper dive into some areas of blockchain research. There are a lot of articles on zero knowledge proofs, and a lot of research papers on SNARKs or STARKs, but very little bridging the intermediate gap.\n\nIf you haven’t read my introduction to zero knowledge proofs Twitter thread, I strongly recommend it before going further, as a lot of this article builds on top of it.\n\n[https://twitter.com/pseudotheos/status/1476380179966615557](https://twitter.com/pseudotheos/status/1476380179966615557)\n\nThe first introduction of a zero-knowledge proof was in a [1985 MIT paper](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf) (PDF warning) by Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali (who later founded [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/)).\n\nzkSNARKs and zkSTARKs are implementations of non-interactive zero knowledge proofs, which means that the prover does not need to disclose the data to the verifier. Non-interactive means that the prover only needs to send a single message to the verifier, instead of back-and-forth communication. This makes it possible for a blockchain to utilize ZK proofs, as blockchains are one-way. Once the block is produced, it is immutable.\n\nThere are two methods of zero-knowledge proofs that are currently being implemented with blockchain tech: zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs. In the Ethereum rollup space, there are two leaders: [zkSync](https://zksync.io/) is using zkSNARKs, and [StarkWare](https://starkware.co/) is using zkSTARKs. In addition to these two, there is [Loopring](https://loopring.io/), [Aztec](https://aztec.network/), [Polygon Hermez](https://hermez.io/) (SNARKs), [Polygon Miden](https://github.com/maticnetwork/miden) (STARKs), and many more. You can find a full list on [zkrollups.xyz](https://www.zkrollups.xyz/). Regardless of the implementation of SNARKs vs STARKs, all rollups solve the same problem and should be thought of less as competitors and more as collaborators both helping advance and scale Ethereum through different means.\n\n### Introducing zkSNARKs\n\nzkSNARK is an acronym: Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge. Stemming from a [2012 UC Berkeley paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2090236.2090263) by Alessandro Chiesa, zkSNARKs use elliptic curves to secure the randomness required for a proof.\n\nElliptic curves are collision resistant, which means that it is *very hard* to find two separate inputs that produce the same output. If you’re interested in learning more about how elliptic curves work in regards to cryptography, this video is a great introduction.\n\n[https://youtu.be/NF1pwjL9-DE](https://youtu.be/NF1pwjL9-DE)\n\nzkSNARKs were first introduced in blockchain by Zcash, a fork of Bitcoin. Because SNARKs have been around longer, they have a lot of documentation, tooling, and are easier to get into as a developer compared to STARKs. There are some downsides to existing implementations, such as no post-quantum resistance (a problem for the next decade) and initial trust requirements. Regardless of the downsides, SNARKs offer much more than optimistic rollups, as shown below.\n\n![source: Matter Labs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iUL7XrQR0EGnrcrnkGMZ2.png?height=1288&width=1364)\n\nOne issue with SNARKs is that they usually require a trusted setup. To mitigate the trust problem, zkSync has introduced a [universal trusted setup](https://blog.matter-labs.io/zksync-is-live-bringing-trustless-scalable-payments-to-ethereum-9c634b3e6823) for zkSync v1, which is much more secure compared to previous application-specific setups. Previous implementations required a lot more trust, as well as another setup for every future update of the protocol. Recently, [DARKs were introduced](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1229) ([and later modified for security](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/358)) which remove the need for a trusted setup. zkSync has been working on [Redshift](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1400), which solves both the trusted setup problem as well as provides post-quantum security. Once this has been properly reviewed and battle-tested, it will be implemented into zkSync.\n\n### zkSTARKs\n\nBeing much more recent, zkSTARKs have less tooling and developer support, but that is starting to change. [Introduced in 2018](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pdf) (PDF warning) by Eli Ben-Sasson, Iddo Bentov, Yinon Horeshy and Michael Riabzev, STARKs operate differently under the hood. zkSTARK is an acronym for Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge. The main difference between SNARKs and STARKs is that a STARK uses collision resistant hash functions instead of elliptic curves. There are some downsides to STARKs as well, mainly that proof sizes are much larger than a SNARK proof, and take longer to verify as well as cost more gas. This tradeoff is worth it, however, because the effective TPS and throughput ceiling is much higher than a SNARK.\n\nSTARKs are more scalable than SNARKs, and with [Validiums](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/validium/), which store data off-chain, the gas ceiling that developers have had to deal with on L1s is effectively gone. Here’s an example of a 3d model stored on a zkSTARK rollup, something that is impossible on a L1.\n\n[https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza/status/1477950243266527236](https://twitter.com/guiltygyoza/status/1477950243266527236)\n\n### Comparisons\n\nThe levels in the charts below refer to complexity of arithmetic circuits. Each level is roughly 55x more complex than the previous level. In these examples, the difficulty slope for zkSTARKs rises much slower than SNARKs. As TPS and throughput increase, so does complexity. Even though zkSNARKs are less scalable, they are still magnitudes more scalable than existing L1s. Right now, zkSync can manage 3000 TPS with the same security guarantees as a L1 Ethereum transaction. With zkPorter, zkSync’s [Validium](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/validium/) solution, it can settle 50,000+ TPS.\n\n![source: ZK-STARK whitepaper and Adam Luciano](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0rWxz2C9HSJEiY0HwMC4p.png?height=364&width=700)\n\n![source: ZK-STARK whitepaper and Adam Luciano](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZFbzyu-ghHgcUcmAsa1fa.png?height=413&width=696)\n\n![source: ZK-STARK whitepaper and Adam Luciano](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lLRuuSWDEqkLAibY2Rzoh.png?height=383&width=700)\n\n![source: Matter Labs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/g_NFwArVbb4-loiJ5ptye.png?height=800&width=1354)\n\n### Beyond L2s\n\nScalability is very close to becoming infinite, which will open the doors to a truly trustless, fast, and low-cost application layer secured by Ethereum. StarkWare is working on [recursive STARKs known as L3s](https://medium.com/starkware/fractal-scaling-from-l2-to-l3-7fe238ecfb4f) which stretch scaling even further.\n\n![source: StarkWare](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GcJhFXvUFoAz3UHMhkSLj.png?height=421&width=700)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe zero knowledge space is still an area of active research, and there is still a lot of work to be done before we reach the [Endgame](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html), but the tech is advancing rapidly and moving away from the Layer 1 wars towards a rollup-centric future.\n\n*Thanks for reading this article!

It was not pretty. I came out bleeding in 2 places, my bathing suit ripped, but I did feel victorious. \n\nIt was this cliff overlooking the ocean that few people merrily jumped off. A regular dude did backflips, couples whooshed in together, and my friend kept urging me to do it. I sat on a rock and dreaded it. My hands got sweaty, I had to control my breathing, and I did way too much thinking and not enough, well, jumping. \n\nSo I didn’t jump that first day. \n\nI felt downtrodden after we left, even though I was safe. And it played on in my head, the voices a chaotic orchestra of “it doesn’t matter”, “you could have jumped and you didn’t”, “you didn’t face your fear”. You get the gist. \n\nI think a couple days went by where I hiked, tried to surf *(shallow waters are fine, it’s the deeper ocean that gets me),* and overall enjoyed the paradisic Hawaii life. I don’t remember what prompted me to ask my friend to go back to that cliff. \n\nMaybe I felt stronger. Maybe I felt more comfortable with the ocean. Maybe it was the *plant medicine.* Maybe I just wanted to leave on a high. Maybe all of it.\n\nSo we went back. He jumped first, and I didn’t think before I leaped in next. \n\nFuckfuckfuck that was a lot of falling. \n\nIf you ever find yourself needing to jump off a cliff, I recommend not opening your mouth as you go in, because you will come out with bleeding gums. Also, be prepared for the water to slap you harder than you’ve ever been slapped before in your life. She will show you no mercy. \n\nAnd try going in as straight as you can, like a pencil, upright. Shit hurts if it smacks your stomach. \n\nMy triumph at jumping was short lived once I realized how far I was from the shore, so I started swimming back and not thinking of how deep the water went. As soon as I could touch my feet and see humans on the beach, I let myself relax a bit but it was hard with all the adrenaline pumping through my veins. I felt invincible.\n\nI’m not recommending you jump off a 40 foot cliff. In fact, it’s smarter to advise you NOT to. I am still scared of the ocean, and I still get butterflies when I’m on the edge of most high places. One adventurous cliff jump won’t cure that. \n\nBut, it will do something. I always have that singular moment to pull from when I need inspiration. When I chose to jump off the secure ground into the unknown that terrified me. A reference point, which is the best thing you can give your brain.\n\nIf I can do *that*, well, what else? \n\n** \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n **", "timestamp": 1653399073, "digest": "0rBRSyEQl3pTyORu2M8yUMvmjkuhT5seofawhJMJRqo", "contributor": "0x378eD36356d512Ee67C97782a5a398a4C14C5c1E"}

在艺术水准上执行非常完美，包括色调一致性，精美又夸张的杜绝，轮廓独特等，一些1:1图片（详见后文对比图）制作改编时相当体现功力。他认为这种原创水准的一致性能赋予作品艺术上的份量和深度。\n\n他说，人们可以在几秒种内识别原创艺术和山寨土狗之间的区别，并指出这是BAYC、DOODLES和Azuki艺术上能成立，而ZIPCY等其他项目无法成功的原因。\n\n![三大原创](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yKlgLFErNgNf6RKawe-1F.png?height=386&width=735)\n\n作者还列出了2张从上述原创作品而来的“图狗”作为对比：\n\n![图狗仿盘](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1J9yw8sK7F-qH6x2twinm.png?height=413&width=735)\n\n同时还列举了其他的官方内容，认为项目在整体艺术风格执行上非常好。\n\n同时，他强调说，实际上，丑陋或怪诞很难有吸引力，特别是对于欧美人来说，因为大家习惯了迪士尼的“培训”，因此，作者认为[@goblintownwtf](https://twitter.com/goblintownwtf) 的风格是“令人印象深刻的壮举”。\n\n实际上，研究员人员发现，项目确实做到了观察到项目的每个人都对这些哥布林印象深刻——无论觉得他们“超酷”或是“太丑”。\n\n### 三、项目特色\n\n哥布林官网呈现它独特的风格，通过一个很酷的动画和两个地精之间的“哥布林语”对话将整个村落的氛围呈现，十分独特，十分酷炫。\n\n![官网](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2k4BD2sqpolFuQnTXh9OH.png?height=648&width=882)\n\n在官网下方有一个个相框，旁边标注着family，点击之后会跳出团队页面，但我们无法从中窥探出团队成员有哪一些人组成，一般来说，匿名的项目会显得不够友好，但当人们厌倦了明星和大咖们的失败之后，有着独特风格的项目变得更加讨喜一点。\n\n![神秘团队](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Wundad4D5eGa1PIj822JT.png?height=641&width=876)\n\n区别于主流的NFT项目，这个项目并没有路线图，甚至也没有DC，项目方似乎想做的是一个没有社区没有路线也没有实用程序的meme型的NFT，而这给项目带来了更多的悬念和关注。\n\n官方进行了一场充满仪式感的语音SPACE，每个人都在怪异的声音说着“哥布林语”，听起来就像是疯子的聚会——其中一位观众发言询问路线图之类，被粗暴打断，而在社区人们甚至在欢呼幸好打断了，以免氛围被破坏。\n\nGoblintown项目在所有的渠道都在用“哥布林语”，甚至在推特space里也在用哥布林语，包括最新的投票，人们都需要破译。\n\n![投票](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XKkSxL2mRPlZ7PG4TQr3C.png?height=309&width=543)\n\n项目方的种种做法，透露出营销水平较为高明，效果也较好，在发布后的几天，是ETH链上表现最好的NFT项目。\n\n### 四、市场营销\n\n项目在5月20号晚上公开free mint，但直到五月21号在被linksdao创始人[@mdudas](https://twitter.com/mdudas/status/1527802366292025344?s=20&t=QfrBZFqTOsha8_9JlQPEow) 提及后一个小时内Free mint售罄，并且OS交易量冲到了30多个ETH。\n\n![市场](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3fKUZvYfgaVdPKd5GxS6W.png?height=450&width=542)\n\n随后，许多人开始猜测哥布林的团队背景，甚至有人根据一些线索认为哥布林是yugalabs的秘密项目，真假莫辫之下，各种转推让项目的热度开始上升。地板在当天来到0.1ETH。\n\n5月22号4点，官推否认yugalabs有关，随后疑似承认@steveaoki是Goblintown的创始人。\n\n![营销](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/C9T3ycQlEzU2bkgBAhlrn.png?height=969&width=911)\n\n[@steveaoki](https://twitter.com/steveaoki) 是一个有着825万粉丝DJ，音乐人，是北美巡演票房最高的电子舞曲艺人，同时也发行了A0K1VERSE Passport项目，目前地板0.149，总交易量148，前期地板高峰时0.8E，目前交易量极尽萎缩。\n\n而在整个NFT的系列中，一共有12个1:1，其中#5948号和[@steveaoki](https://twitter.com/steveaoki) 确实有一些像。\n\n![对比图](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JKzLjasAIHjR-wkydGEHp.png?height=495&width=936)\n\n这让哥布林的地板价飙升至0.18，而且交易量迅速放大，FOMO情绪和共识都在不断的累积，各类鲜活的表情包开始迅速传播（国外NFT圈子对表情包、动图等使用很广泛）。\n\n但是，根据我们的研究，可以确认，项目方更多的是在蹭热度，是一种“巧妙”的营销，因为在[@steveaoki](https://twitter.com/steveaoki) 的推特我们不会搜索到任何goblin相关内容。\n\n而且，官推在六个小时之后，又发了同样格式的推文，宣称自己不是[@steveaoki](https://twitter.com/steveaoki) ，而是 [@Beeple](https://baike.baidu.com/item/Beeple/58632391?fr=aladdin) （一位传奇的NFT艺术家，其单幅NFT作品在佳士得拍卖行售价高达6025万美元）\n\n![营销](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZqC1gIocgZtpO6nLRAVJ0.png?height=830&width=898)\n\n这或许是一种不错的营销方式，但其体现的价值观是否够好值得思考。\n\n在此之外，官方还设置了多个“神秘彩蛋”NFT未开图，目前在OS人们给出了7的offer。官推不断更新相关推文，留悬念设置，预示蛋会有一些特殊的故事可以讲。\n\n目前为止，官方推特活跃度极高，从5月18日发送第一条推特到我写下这篇文章5月23号，已经发表了近600多条推特，平均一天近100条。\n\n### 五、链上数据\n\n首先看一下总体成交历史，最高价区间到了0.8-1左右，0.5是密集换手区间。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Q0G0WQYp3GlUmGQTi3rVW.png?height=559&width=1866)\n\n根据NFTGO数据，目前项目蓝筹指数为25.74%，上线几天持续增长中，其中BAYC和猴子地的持有者最多，月鸟次之，具体如下图：\n\n![蓝筹指数](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/75XB_qKdurhuDUfPdWXup.png?height=346&width=674)\n\n目前项目持有人数4305人，作为上线不到一周的新项目来讲，分布相当不错，许多项目上线一两个月持有人数还破不了2000，同时目前持有者分布中，持有1个NFT的人数较多，具体见下图：\n\n![持有者分布](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/t_wlByI-rRHhDfRPjMSHq.png?height=361&width=1121)\n\n### 六、研究总结\n\n总体来说，这是一个艺术风格鲜明，营销手段高明的另类项目，和传统项目买推特假粉、大搞抽奖转发、DC搞机器人不同，项目方没有用这些招数，但却获得了较高的市场热度，这是熊市背景下难得的优秀案例。\n\n如果说，Mfers的成功让人们对原创与某种文化产生了向往，而Goblintown这个没有语言差异，没有地区差异，没有性别差异的哥布林出现时，妖精镇的故事让各种不同文化的人都有了不同的收获。\n\n尤其是近期solana链的NFT爆火而导致ETH链上的NFT玩家们期待有一个ETH链项目能提振士气，或许也是一个资金急切寻找的口子。\n\n从项目方的总体营销来讲，悬念、故事，原创的艺术与语言等都值得持续跟踪观察。\\[end\\]\n\n>

Augminted Labs Scientists\n\n![https://opensea.io/collection/augminted-labs-scientists](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/23_RNId-kLtCQ_pIKKVth.png?height=628&width=1476)\n\n* 市場：ETH\n* 上榜時間：週二（1100ex/day）、週三（2400ex/day）\n* 風格類型：像素、PFP、P2E、free mint\n* 推特：245.3K @KaijuKingz\n* KaijuKingz的衍生項目\n* mint期間無限量供應，最終51190個，自助捏人式mint，可以自行選擇人物特點，可以free mint，也可以選擇0.066做成動圖，或者0.4增加畫面特效，似乎free的不能參加後期P2E，而mint時的投入E多少，會和P2E回報率相關。\n* 比較創新的NFT mint玩法，建議保持關注，後續P2E玩法清晰後，可尋找低價動圖入手。\n* 優勢：低價、大量、捏人玩法增加參與度\n* 風險：後期P2E是否有吸引力，以及如何安置大量的free NFT\n\n### 9. Metroverse Genesis Mini\n\n![https://opensea.io/collection/metroverse-genesis-mini](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rH9SiJeXixcn08CgVno39.png?height=720&width=1568)\n\n* 市場：ETH\n* 上榜時間：週三（1100ex/day）\n* 風格類型：地產、3D、GameFi\n* 推特：241.1K @themetroverse\n* 5月11日發售的項目，此波為開圖，Metroverse的入門款\n* 總供應量49.9K，地塊上不同的建築物有不同的價值，後期會有PVP遊戲，建築設計風格非常好，建議關注PVP的玩法，後期還有1000個市長mint，有想像空間，可以提前佈局\n* 優勢：入門款便宜、整個Metroverse框架已經基本成型，不確定性較低\n* 風險：入門款在後續玩法中的比重\n\n### 10.

Welcome to our stealth launch.\n\n\n---\n\n*The ASX Genesis Event has arrived. Please read this article carefully to understand the novel mechanics of this event.*\n\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\n*Values in US$ consider ETH priced at $1,925.*\n\n* **Token:** ASX (ERC-20) → Governance Token of the ASX Protocol\n* **Network:** Ethereum Mainnet\n* **Total / Max Supply:** 1,000,000,000 ASX\n* **Genesis Event Allocation:** 800,000,000 ASX\n* **Initial Liquidity Allocation:** 200,000,000 ASX\n* **Mint Rate:** 1 ASX / 0.000004 ETH or 250,000 ASX / 1 ETH\n* **Venue:** Self-hosted at <https://mint.asx.st/>\n* **Mode:** First-come, first-served basis (FCFS)\n* **Start date**: Live now\n* **End date**: 10 days after the soft cap is reached\n* **Soft Cap:** 1000 ETH | 250,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Hard Cap:** 3200 ETH | 800,000,000 ASX minted\n* **Fully Diluted Market Cap / Value (FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 312,500,000 ASX \\~ $2,406,250 | 687,500,000 ASX burned\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 1,000,000,000 ASX \\~ $7,700,000 | 0 ASX burned\n* **Initial Liquidity (40% of FDV)**\n  * **at Soft Cap:** 62,500,000 ASX + 250 ETH | \\~ $962,500\n  * **at Hard Cap:** 200,000,000 ASX + 800 ETH | \\~ $3,080,000\n* There's no founders or team allocation, no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, and no airdrop. The Genesis Event is the first and only place to get ASX tokens before listing.\n* Team and partners are allowed to participate after the progress bar reaches 50%.\n* Participants can claim their ASX tokens once the event is completed. There's no vesting. 100% of the max supply will be unlocked and circulating on day one.\n* Once the soft cap is reached (250,000,000 ASX minted), a countdown of 10 days will start. When it hits zero, the Genesis Event will end, the initial liquidity pool on Uniswap will be created and the remaining ASX will be burned along with the liquidity provider (LP) token.\n* ASX ERC-20 smart contract address: **0x5313235002b9F11698D7B9187Be44f836FEbD6b5**.\n\n\n---\n\n## A unique token launch\n\nAs a community-focused project committed to the ethos and founding principles of the blockchain space, we are pleased to announce the official launch of **ASX**, the governance token of the ASX Protocol.\n\nIn the spirit of equal distribution, fairness, decentralization, and a community-first ideology, the launch event is taking place on our [custom-made platform](https://mint.asx.st/) and it's the first and only opportunity for anyone to get access to the ASX Protocol's native token, **ASX**, which will give holders the power to govern and curate essential infrastructure components of the network.\n\nOur mission is to give everyone in our community an opportunity to become a stakeholder in the ecosystem, and we want to extend that opportunity as fairly as possible. Launching ASX on our own platform, with a mechanism that is fair and transparent for all participants, drastically increases the chances of achieving this mission.\n\nApart from building our own token launch platform, we made sure everyone was on a level playing field. There's no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, no emission (zero inflation), zero tokens to influencers or promoters, no airdrop, and zero Treasury, Company, Founders, Team, or Partners allocation.\n\n### 1 billion ASX tokens. 800 million to be minted, 200 million for liquidity. That's it.\n\n> *The protocol's revenue will exclusively serve ASX holders and all operations will be funded with ETH or stablecoins.*\n\nThe ASX Genesis Event is open to all interested and qualifying parties. It's a major milestone for the ASX Protocol ecosystem and speaks to the viability of our core technology and business model as we aim to become the ultimate permissionless omnichain liquidity hub for staked assets.\n\nAt ASX Labs, we believe in creating a global staking ecosystem of the people, by the people, for the people, that shall not perish under any threats. The crypto dream has never been about creating an instrument that can easily be put in a box, but about creating global assets that can govern and manage these new decentralized global networks.\n\n## Understanding the mechanics\n\nTo mint 1 ASX you need to contribute 0.000004 ETH. A total of 800,000,000 ASX will be available for minting. Due to the low fully diluted market cap of the project and to ensure as broad a distribution as possible and dramatically soften the potential for a massive gas war, we decided to operate in stealth mode until 50% of the tokens are minted.\n\nThere's a minimum of 1 ASX per mint and no maximum. Setting up a max cap per wallet without KYC is foolish and we're not big fans of KYC in DeFi. For us, privacy and freedom are paramount, and we respect and stand by yours. With that said, there's a cap of 100 ETH per mint on our Interface just to slow things down, if they get a bit crazy.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to hear about the ASX Protocol early, you'll have enough time to participate. Otherwise, you can get ASX tokens on Uniswap, after the Genesis Event is completed.\n\n## How to participate\n\nParticipating in the ASX Genesis Event is simple, quick, and intuitive, and getting prepared is even easier. Here’s what you’ll need:\n\n→ **An Ethereum-compatible web3 browser wallet**, such as MetaMask. You can generate a wallet address from these web3 wallets directly, or use your seeds to import an existing wallet address.\n\n→ **Sufficient ETH**, which you will need in order to contribute and pay for transactions gas fees.\n\nOnce you’ve got your checklist all set, here’s what the process will look like:\n\n1. To get started, head to our custom-made [Launch Platform](https://mint.asx.st/).\n2. You’ll be prompted with a welcome message. Click on \"**PARTICIPATION TERMS**\". Read everything and, if you agree, click on \"**I AGREE**\". Next, click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n3. The next message will be a TL;DR of the ASX Genesis Event. Carefully read everything and click on \"**CONTINUE**\".\n4. You can now connect your wallet. We support almost any web3 injected wallet, but for a flawless experience, we recommend using MetaMask. Click on \"**CONNECT WALLET**\", either in the center or on the upper right-hand corner of the page.\n5. Once your wallet is connected, the ETH and ASX input fields will become available to you. You may either insert the amount of ASX you would like to receive or the amount of ETH you would like to contribute. Enter the desired amount and click on \"**MINT**\". Please make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to pay for transaction fees.\n6. You will see a popup from your MetaMask wallet. Confirm the transaction and then wait for it to go through. Once it is validated on the Ethereum blockchain, your ASX balance, on the top of the page, will update and a \"CLAIM\" button will appear. You will be able to claim your ASX tokens once the event is completed.\n7. That's it! You successfully participated in the ASX Genesis Event.\n\n*Once your transaction is validated, a smart contract, that works like an escrow, will receive your ASX tokens and keep them safe until the end of the Genesis Event, when you will be able to claim them. Claimed ASX tokens are not locked and there is no vesting.*\n\n*Team and partners are allowed to participate in the Genesis Event after the progress bar reaches 50%. If the desired amount of ASX that those parties intend to hold can't be fully minted during this event, the remaining amount will be purchased on Uniswap.*\n\n## Liquidity\n\nBy the end of the Genesis Event, the initial liquidity of the ASX token will be immediately provided as a full range position on Uniswap V3. Since the resulting liquidity provider (LP) token will be directly burned, this initial position will be perpetual.\n\nThe liquidity depth will represent 40% of the FDV (Fully Diluted Value) and its absolute value will be based on the total ASX minted.\n\n* At soft cap, 250 ETH will be paired with 62,500,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $962,500 of liquidity depth.\n* At hard cap, 800 ETH will be paired with 200,000,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $3,080,000 of liquidity depth.\n\n*The Genesis Event will end in 10 days after the soft cap is reached or when all ASX tokens are minted, whichever comes first. Any unminted ASX will be burned.*\n\n## Security\n\nWe were very careful when deciding the code for the ASX ERC-20 smart contract and, to make it the safest possible, we only allowed the absolutely necessary lines of code. There's no mint function, no pause function and the contract is not upgradeable. It is an immutable token on the Ethereum Mainnet Network.\n\nBoth the ERC-20 and the Genesis Event smart contracts were developed with the highest levels of security, leveraging the battle-tested OpenZeppelin standard. With the entire supply circulating by the end of the Genesis Event plus the immediate burn of the liquidity provider (LP) token, you can rest assured that the ASX token can never be hacked or rugged.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nThe team at ASX Labs will NEVER DM YOU FIRST or ask you for money on any platform. You should be very skeptical of any DMs received by anyone claiming to be from ASX Labs.\n\nOnly trust ASX Protocol's official channels at the bottom of this announcement for information surrounding the event.\n\nThe ASX token will only be available once the Genesis Event is completed. Only then you will be able to trade it on Uniswap. Be sure to always check the smart contract address before trading.\n\n\n---\n\nThis is the first step towards an omnichain yield future.

{"id": "e_oVo0oiyRl6xCLQx5lTPuW-tVn5rk-Bf_UjzhCTRw0", "title": "Introducing — ASX Protocol", "body": "## Yield Strategies. Unified.\n\nGiven the fast-paced nature of DeFi, where new opportunities and choices arise every second, the main goal of many investors and participants is to focus their capital on assets that provide either utility or additional revenue streams.\n\nTo that end, staked assets play a very important role in enabling these additional use cases. However, in today's market, yield strategies are segmented between many players on several chains. Searching for the right chain and the right protocol to park your assets is time-consuming and costly.\n\nCurrently, if a user has interest-bearing assets on Chain A but finds a better opportunity on Chain B, he has to withdraw the assets from Protocol A (fee), send them to Chain B via a bridge (fee), and deposit them in Protocol B (fee). If he then finds a more interesting opportunity on Chain C, this whole process has to be repeated.\n\nFor tech-savvy large users (whales), this may not seem like a big deal, but for the average user, those fees alone can eat all their profits.\n\nOne of the base pillars of DeFi is time and money optimization and, as avid developers and users of it, we were always looking for a one-stop solution protocol, one that would take care of all the hard lifting and fees... one that was designed for everyone.\n\nSince we couldn't find it, we decided to build our own.\n\n## Enter ASX\n\nASX Protocol functions as a top layer DeFi network for staked assets, combining ASX's strategies with the most profitable ones available in the market.\n\nAssets deposited into an ASX Vault enter an automatic process of yield maximization through capital shifting, auto-compounding, rebalancing, and routing across multiple protocols and chains, making ASX a more capital-efficient alternative.\n\n### How does it work?\n\nASX smart contracts operate on three main spectrums:\n\n* ASX's own strategies\n* Third-party protocols' strategies\n* Combined strategies on each chain\n\nFor routing the staked assets across protocols of the same chain, ASX Vaults monitor the available protocols' performance using on-chain data and use that information to calculate the routing's viability and the best capital allocation.\n\nThe protocol then uses relayers, working in tandem with an oracle, to receive information between the available chains and sends the relevant data to each Vault. The Vault then determines the best asset allocation for each chain and protocol and executes.\n\nA lot is going on under the hood. We'll share more details on the mechanics once our smart contracts are open-sourced.\n\n### Chains and Protocols\n\nOur operations on yield routing are broken down into 3 phases:\n\nFor the first iterations of ASX (1st phase), the following chains and protocols will be available:\n\n* Ethereum → ASX, Convex, Yearn\n* Fantom → ASX, Yearn, Tarot\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HAJhRzkBfBUBbQN-IUwt1.png?height=1909&width=3000)\n\nDuring the 2nd phase, we'll expand the network into two more EVM compatible blockchains: Avalanche and Polygon.\n\nOn the 3rd phase will break the EVM boundaries and expand ASX into Terra and Solana, using the LayerZero network, making ASX truly omnichain.\n\n> *While ASX smart contracts are getting ready for public release, the interface will allow direct access to the third-party protocols' vaults*.\n\n## The ASX Token\n\nASX has been conceived, built, and driven by a founding group of individuals with expertise in creating web3 solutions and a core belief in decentralization and privacy.\n\nASX is the result of many months of development and it's our legacy to the crypto community. Because of that, we decided to do things a little differently.\n\nWe'll explain all the details about our token launch in our next post.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nThe core vision for ASX is to be the ultimate permissionless omnichain liquidity hub for staked assets, expanding beyond the borders of EVM and Non-EVM.\n\nOur smart contracts are currently in private beta and have consistently shown better performance than the third-party protocols' strategies. We're finishing up the final touches and getting them ready to be open-sourced and peer-reviewed before the public release, within the coming weeks.\n\nThe omnichain yield future is inevitable.

Launching ASX on our own platform, with a mechanism that is fair and transparent for all participants, drastically increases the chances of achieving this mission.\n\nApart from building our own token launch platform, we made sure everyone was on a level playing field. There's no seed or private sale, no liquidity mining, no emission (zero inflation), zero tokens to influencers or promoters, no airdrop, and zero Treasury, Company, Founders, Team, or Partners allocation.\n\n### 1 billion ASX tokens. 800 million to be minted, 200 million for liquidity. That's it.\n\n> *The protocol's revenue will exclusively serve ASX holders and all operations will be funded with ETH or stablecoins.*\n\nThe ASX Genesis Event is open to all interested and qualifying parties. It's a major milestone for the ASX Protocol ecosystem and speaks to the viability of our core technology and business model as we aim to become the ultimate permissionless omnichain liquidity hub for staked assets.\n\nAt ASX Labs, we believe in creating a global staking ecosystem of the people, by the people, for the people, that shall not perish under any threats. The crypto dream has never been about creating an instrument that can easily be put in a box, but about creating global assets that can govern and manage these new decentralized global networks.\n\n## Understanding the mechanics\n\nTo mint 1 ASX you need to contribute 0.000004 ETH. A total of 800,000,000 ASX will be available for minting. Due to the low fully diluted market cap of the project and to ensure as broad a distribution as possible and dramatically soften the potential for a massive gas war, we decided to operate in stealth mode until 50% of the tokens are minted.\n\nThere's a minimum of 1 ASX per mint and no maximum. Setting up a max cap per wallet without KYC is foolish and we're not big fans of KYC in DeFi. For us, privacy and freedom are paramount, and we respect and stand by yours. With that said, there's a cap of 100 ETH per mint on our Interface just to slow things down, if they get a bit crazy.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to hear about the ASX Protocol early, you'll have enough time to participate. Otherwise, you can get ASX tokens on Uniswap, after the Genesis Event is completed.\n\n## How to participate\n\nParticipating in the ASX Genesis Event is simple, quick, and intuitive, and getting prepared is even easier. Here’s what you’ll need:\n\n→ **An Ethereum-compatible web3 browser wallet**, such as MetaMask. You can generate a wallet address from these web3 wallets directly, or use your seeds to import an existing wallet address.\n\n→ **Sufficient ETH**, which you will need in order to contribute and pay for transactions gas fees.\n\nOnce you’ve got your checklist all set, here’s what the process will look like:\n\n1.

You may either insert the amount of ASX you would like to receive or the amount of ETH you would like to contribute. Enter the desired amount and click on \"**MINT**\". Please make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to pay for transaction fees.\n6. You will see a popup from your MetaMask wallet. Confirm the transaction and then wait for it to go through. Once it is validated on the Ethereum blockchain, your ASX balance, on the top of the page, will update and a \"CLAIM\" button will appear. You will be able to claim your ASX tokens once the event is completed.\n7. That's it! You successfully participated in the ASX Genesis Event.\n\n*Once your transaction is validated, a smart contract, that works like an escrow, will receive your ASX tokens and keep them safe until the end of the Genesis Event, when you will be able to claim them. Claimed ASX tokens are not locked and there is no vesting.*\n\n*Team and partners are allowed to participate in the Genesis Event after the progress bar reaches 50%. If the desired amount of ASX that those parties intend to hold can't be fully minted during this event, the remaining amount will be purchased on Uniswap.*\n\n## Liquidity\n\nBy the end of the Genesis Event, the initial liquidity of the ASX token will be immediately provided as a full range position on Uniswap V3. Since the resulting liquidity provider (LP) token will be directly burned, this initial position will be perpetual.\n\nThe liquidity depth will represent 40% of the FDV (Fully Diluted Value) and its absolute value will be based on the total ASX minted.\n\n* At soft cap, 250 ETH will be paired with 62,500,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $962,500 of liquidity depth.\n* At hard cap, 800 ETH will be paired with 200,000,000 ASX, pricing the token at $0.0077 / ASX with $3,080,000 of liquidity depth.\n\n*The Genesis Event will end in 10 days after the soft cap is reached or when all ASX tokens are minted, whichever comes first. Any unminted ASX will be burned.*\n\n## Security\n\nWe were very careful when deciding the code for the ASX ERC-20 smart contract and, to make it the safest possible, we only allowed the absolutely necessary lines of code. There's no mint function, no pause function and the contract is not upgradeable. It is an immutable token on the Ethereum Mainnet Network.\n\nBoth the ERC-20 and the Genesis Event smart contracts were developed with the highest levels of security, leveraging the battle-tested OpenZeppelin standard. With the entire supply circulating by the end of the Genesis Event plus the immediate burn of the liquidity provider (LP) token, you can rest assured that the ASX token can never be hacked or rugged.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nThe team at ASX Labs will NEVER DM YOU FIRST or ask you for money on any platform.

[Hyperstructures](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html) like Gnosis Safe and Gnosis Guild have led the charge by developing the capabilities we need but the mechanisms have lagged behind.\n\nWe know that the primary value of blue chip NFTs today is not just asset exposure but Discord utility. Utility is a seat at the table. It is an opportunity with compounding benefits and network effects. Unfortunately, there is not a single mechanism in Web3 for DAOs to access Discord in a secure, safe and fair way.\n\nUntil today.\n\nPrysm, Proof, Vulcan and Gnosis Safe are excited to announce that for the first time in Web3, DAOs (and Squads) holding NFTs in their Gnosis Safe can now delegate a single member to access NFT gated communities using Vulcan and Prysm.\n\n> *“No matter when you created the Gnosis Safe or what investment platform you used to do it, you can import your DAO to Prysm with zero modification and get access to Discord. Our protocol is open.”* - [@realShelbyt](https://twitter.com/realshelbyt), Co-Founder and CPO at [Prysm](https://twitter.com/prysm_xyz).\n\n![If you own a Gnosis Safe, Verify with Prysm for Discord Access](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ZRYoqRJq036mGogTks8pg.png?height=1482&width=2000)\n\n### Launch Partners\n\n*The PROOF is in the Pudding*\n\nThis integration is launching first, exclusively for Proof. Using Prysm, DAOs can now delegate one member access to the Proof Discord. As the first NFT community to support DAOs in this way, Proof continues to demonstrate leadership in both technology and community.\n\nFor groups of friends using Prysm or Gnosis Safe, you can now pool funds, buy a Moonbird (just like [FloorbirdsDAO](https://www.prysm.xyz/floorbirds-dao) and [PoorbirdsDAO](https://www.prysm.xyz/poorbirds)), and assign one member to represent your needs in the Proof Discord.\n\n![Poorbirds DAO on Prysm](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wkbaTPmT2NcYsIya_pxtV.png?height=1372&width=2000)\n\nFor NFT Projects like Proof it means a more diverse and inclusive community while continuing the same one member, one DAO address restriction that has always existed. It means being part of a community that places people first and little by little building a better future.\n\n> *\"I started collecting NFTs in July of 2021, with a small wallet and a group of friends who were all equally as excited to start our web3 journey. As I learned more about NFTs, I realized its biggest strength was the power of community. It’s what keeps holders engaged, and excited, and really makes it stand out from all other more traditional forms of investing. This led me to create Token Club, which is comprised of members with varying wallet sizes, investment acumen, and financial goals”* - [@akaStevey_](https://twitter.com/akastevey_) Co-Founder of [TokenClub](https://twitter.com/thetokenclub) and Community Manager at [Proof](https://twitter.com/proof_xyz)\n\n### Prysm x Proof x Vulcan x Gnosis\n\n*Avengers Assemble*\n\nFrom day one this collaboration revolved around three priorities: maintain community integrity, ensure high security, and enable a fair delegation mechanism where one DAO member can access Discord.\n\nVulcan’s novel access control mechanism was already reputed for its secure NFT gating mechanism for Discord. Vulcan does not rely on signatures and does not send users a link to click on. Rather it has users go to a well reputed website like OpenSea and update a field such as the bio section, which Vulcan immediately verifies.\n\n![Vulcan <> Prysm <> Gnosis Authentication Flows](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tSG9TUCpCM_hGyQ1VNwK2.png?height=1800&width=2800)\n\nNext, DAO members had to be verified as being owners of a shared wallet and access needed to be restricted so that the DAO can only delegate a single member. Using a tuple containing the DAO’s wallet address, members address, and NFT specific information ensured that Vulcan could enforce the one member per DAOs restriction.  As DAOs overwhelmingly use Gnosis Safe as the wallet of choice, the Gnosis Safe Service APIs were well equipped to provide this information to us in a reliable way.\n\nFinally, DAO members needed an interface where they could validate membership and tie the Gnosis Safe Data and Vulcan data together. As the premiere platform for NFT Collector DAOs to purchase NFTs, Prysm has built a custom Vulcan Validation flow on-platform for DAOs to validate with. Simply select Validate with Prysm on Discord, enter the one-time key on the Prysm platform, and obtain access.\n\n### Interested in Participating in the Future?\n\n> *\"Inclusion in web3 is a serious consideration that we need to tackle head on. Large barriers of entry to well established projects are a growing problem. I'm excited to see what Prysm continues to build in the web3 space for all of us to help make NFTs and crypto communities more accessible to those that have less. We need to ensure web3 is for everyone and groups that focus on that from the start are going to make the biggest impact.\"* - [@Myrainbowsoda](https://twitter.com/Myrainbowsoda), Community Manager at [Proof](https://twitter.com/proof_xyz)\n\nWith more than 4,800 DAOs ([DeepDAO](https://deepdao.io/organizations)) and an astonishing 31x growth of the ecosystem in 2021, it’s never been more critical to support DAOs as equal players in the ecosystem. For builders, this means including support for DAO tooling, such as [multi-sig sign-in](https://gallery.mirror.xyz/GzHNX1UvpNmBDQjQ0pQnE_wsdxoS0_yWocRGOssH4Xw) and more, enabling participation in your applications for individuals and DAOs alike.\n\n> *“Ultimately, users want to collaborate, share experiences, and participate in utility together. It’s our duty as builders to build for these users in mind and treat digital-first organizations as equals”.* - [@SeanMacAonghais](https://twitter.com/SeanMacAonghais) Gnosis Safe Ecosystem Lead\n\nIf you are a DAO member, let your NFT projects know there is now a way to take part in the alpha you are owed. **You no longer have to choose between security or utility, with Prysm, Vulcan, and Gnosis Safe you can have it all.**\n\n![Security, Utility, Community](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HdT6_yob7C_aa-UrkE43o.png?height=1558&width=2000)\n\n*Prysm is currently in private beta visit <https://prysm.xyz> to register for access.

Después, podrá mover dinero dentro o fuera de la criptografía según sea necesario, por lo que preparar su primera cuenta de intercambio es definitivamente una experiencia fundamental importante.\n\n*   Las lecciones y cuestionarios de Coinbase Earn son materiales de nivel principiante; están diseñados para personas que tienen poca o ninguna familiaridad con el espacio blockchain. Completar estos materiales es divertido y conduce a una comprensión básica de los conceptos criptográficos centrales. \n\n    Completar todos los cuestionarios actualmente disponibles de Coinbase Earn generará \\~ $ 90 USD en recompensas. ¡Tu primera criptomoneda! Con su cuenta de Coinbase, puede intercambiar estas recompensas y consolidarlas en otros activos criptográficos de su elección: BTC, ETH, MATIC, etc. Por ejemplo, \\~ $ 90 negociados en MATIC es más que suficiente para comenzar con NFT en Polygon de una manera de bajo costo.\n\nEn cuanto a cómo usar realmente Coinbase Earn, dirígete al [Panel de control Earn](http://coinbase.com/join/castao\\_7jp?src=ios-link) o haga clic en el botón \"Aprender y ganar\" en el lado izquierdo del sitio web de Coinbase.\n\nDesde aquí, podrá tomar lecciones cortas sobre proyectos criptográficos, simplemente presione el botón \"Iniciar lección\" en cualquier proyecto que despierte su interés primero.

Con este fin, recomiendo encarecidamente a los principiantes en criptografía que echen un vistazo a RabbitHole. \n\nEsto se debe a que RabbitHole es una plataforma que gamifica y recompensa las experiencias educativas curadas de Web3. Al usar RabbitHole, realiza actividades reales en torno a proyectos criptográficos reales, aprendiendo y, a partir de entonces, potencialmente ganando en el proceso.\n\nTenga en cuenta que necesitará una billetera Web3 (MetaMask o WalletConnect) para usar RabbitHole, así que configure una si aún no lo ha hecho. Una vez hecho esto, diríjase al [project’s app](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlkEtyhCAQQE8zLC0-irhgkU2uYYG0SgbBgiaJc_owsYpqiv4A7y0GYUv50mcqSN5hxusEHeGnBECETGqBPHunBZVKjEIRp3vH1KCIL_OaAQ7jg8ZcgZzVBr8Y9Cm-J5ikbCC7Bsn5IqhQkxxBTGK0az_QfgInmQIq73dNdR7iAhq-IV8pAgl6RzzLQ3w8-Gdb5jy7bKz1uKcA3ba1XHn6EArxmlPOKWOKUyEp7XjnFj4waykfrHRKia68vl5r_V0fPT023pVqC5rl2S3pIFnX2E4IJSTcW8eZE6b4RvuvN7K57UeNHq8ZorEB3A2Nt7t_DfMGEXK7xs0GG3\\_PB6E4GyambshmpR-bSc4m0j7gUpuK2pr4DFDKH6NVhqo), ¡conecta tu billetera y estarás listo para comenzar!\n\nAhora depende de ti decidir con qué desafíos de habilidades quieres comenzar.

Después, podrá mover dinero dentro o fuera de la criptografía según sea necesario, por lo que preparar su primera cuenta de intercambio es definitivamente una experiencia fundamental importante.\n\n*   Las lecciones y cuestionarios de Coinbase Earn son materiales de nivel principiante; están diseñados para personas que tienen poca o ninguna familiaridad con el espacio blockchain. Completar estos materiales es divertido y conduce a una comprensión básica de los conceptos criptográficos centrales. \n\n    Completar todos los cuestionarios actualmente disponibles de Coinbase Earn generará \\~ $ 90 USD en recompensas. ¡Tu primera criptomoneda! Con su cuenta de Coinbase, puede intercambiar estas recompensas y consolidarlas en otros activos criptográficos de su elección: BTC, ETH, MATIC, etc. Por ejemplo, \\~ $ 90 negociados en MATIC es más que suficiente para comenzar con NFT en Polygon de una manera de bajo costo.\n\nEn cuanto a cómo usar realmente Coinbase Earn, dirígete al [Panel de control Earn](http://coinbase.com/join/castao\\_7jp?src=ios-link) o haga clic en el botón \"Aprender y ganar\" en el lado izquierdo del sitio web de Coinbase.\n\nDesde aquí, podrá tomar lecciones cortas sobre proyectos criptográficos, simplemente presione el botón \"Iniciar lección\" en cualquier proyecto que despierte su interés primero. Si lo hace, se iniciará automáticamente una serie de diapositivas educativas que presentan las ideas principales de la criptografía que ha seleccionado.\n\n¡Siempre que esté listo, puede hacer clic en el botón \"Tomar cuestionario\" para poner a prueba sus nuevos conocimientos!\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F310f8bf8-97bb-488d-ab99-26190a3721bb\\_578x915.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F310f8bf8-97bb-488d-ab99-26190a3721bb\\_578x915.png)\n\nTenga en cuenta que cada proyecto tiene múltiples lecciones y cuestionarios, generalmente tres cada uno. A medida que complete con éxito los cuestionarios, ganará recompensas denominadas en el token del proyecto en cuestión, por ejemplo, tokens FET como se muestra en la imagen a continuación.\n\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a0d1fb6-ef84-4836-89c9-6413f267b7fc\\_507x519.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a0d1fb6-ef84-4836-89c9-6413f267b7fc\\_507x519.png)\n\nUna vez que haya terminado con todos los materiales de Earn, ¡habrá obtenido un sentido fundamental de los conceptos básicos de la criptografía y habrá ganado sus primeras tenencias sin tener que comprar nada!

In fact, Hayek attacked the assertion by quoting history facts, that the monopoly first prevailed in those countries with less advanced economic system and comparatively young industry and the monopolization as the aftermath of protection policy in British, and concluded that the trend was no less than the consequence of the assistance of the power of the state to make control effective. \n  \n While this assertion is inconceivable on the term of facts, I think it also neglects the factor of quality change, because it fundamentally relies on the condition in which the whole competition is pure quantitative, that also become the evidence of simple-oriented idealism which will be mentioned afterwards. \n  \n While this assertion is inconceivable on the term of facts, I think it also neglects the factor of quality change, because it fundamentally relies on the condition in which the whole competition is pure quantitative, that also become the evidence of simple-oriented idealism which will be mentioned afterwards.\n\n> Of the various arguments employed to demonstrate the inevitability of planning, the one most frequently heard is that technological changes have made competition impossible in a constantly increasing number of fields and that the only choice left to us is between control of production by private monopolies and direction by the government. This belief derives mainly from the Marxist doctrine of the “concentration of industry,” \n  \n The important question is whether this development is a necessary consequence of the advance of technology or whether it is simply the result of the policies pursued in most countries. \n  \n This argument singles out one effect sometimes accompanying technological progress; it disregards others which work in the opposite direction; and it receives little support from a serious study of the facts. \n  \n An investigation of conditions in England would lead to very similar results. Anyone who has observed how aspiring monopolists regularly seek and frequently obtain the assistance of the power of the state to make their control effective can have little doubt that there is nothing inevitable about this development. \n  \n If they were the result of technological developments or a necessary product of the evolution of “capitalism,” we should expect them to appear first in the countries with the most advanced economic system. In fact, they appeared first during the last third of the nineteenth century in what were then comparatively young industrial countries, the United States and Germany. \n  \n Not only the instrument of protection but direct inducements and ultimately compulsion were used by the governments to further the creation of monopolies for the regulation of prices and sales. \n  \n And, although during the 1920s it suffered severely from incompatible policies followed with regard to wages and to money, at least the years up to 1929 compare with regard to employment and general activity not unfavorably with the 1930s. It is only since the transition to protection and the general change in British economic policy accompanying it that the growth of monopolies has proceeded at an amazing rate and has transformed British industry to an extent the public has scarcely yet realized.\n\n### Two: Fate of Overwhelming Outside Events\n\nSome argued it was due to outside events instead of public opinion, that Hayek responded briefly with German as the example.\n\n> It could thus be argued that monopolistic organization of industry grew up in spite of the fact that public opinion still favored competition but that outside events frustrated their  wishes.\n>\n> In the progressive advance toward a  completely  planned  society  the  Germans,  and  all  the  people  who  are imitating their example, are merely following the course which nineteenth-century  thinkers,  particularly  Germans,  have  mapped  out  for  them.  The intellectual  history  of  the  last  sixty  or  eighty  years  is  indeed  a  perfect illustration  of  the  truth  that  in  social  evolution  nothing  is  inevitable  but thinking makes it so.\n\n### Three: The Problematic Complexity from Competition\n\nThe third thesis supporting the inevitability of planning suggested the complexity resulted from competition would contribute to dissolve social life into chaos. That hinted condition, the social life should be formed for a simple deliberately arranged organization so that individual could master it entirely, could only be desirable for those simple-oriented thinkers who leave out the complexity of the real world to understand it easily and to change it into simpler one with simple method. They would recast for a new world what they like, it demonstrates them selfish in a sense while portends the totalitarian herald. It is not enough for me just to judge it and infer a potential thread of it, Hayek undertook the competition positively, he said, no other than this complexity allowed competition to become self-coordinate without which the division of labor could never be so efficient and a growth of material could never exist.\n\n> It  may  mean  that  the complexity of our modern industrial civilization creates new problems with which we cannot hope to deal effectively except by central planning.\n>\n> What they generally suggest is that the increasing difficulty of obtaining  a  coherent  picture  of  the  complete  economic  process  makes  it indispensable that things should be coordinated by some central agency if social life is not to dissolve in chaos.\n>\n> This argument is based on a complete misapprehension of the working of competition.  Far  from  being  appropriate  only  to  comparatively  simple conditions, it is the very complexity of the division of labor under modern conditions  which  makes  competition  the  only  method  by  which  such coordination can be adequately brought about. There would be no difficulty about efficient control or planning were conditions so simple that a single person or board could effectively survey all the relevant facts. It is only as the factors which have to be taken into account become so numerous that it is impossible to gain a synoptic view of them that decentralization becomes imperative.  But,  once  decentralization  is  necessary,  the  problem  of coordination arises—a coordination which leaves the separate agencies free to  adjust  their  activities  to  the  facts  which  only  they  can  know  and  yet brings  about  a  mutual  adjustment  of  their  respective  plans.  As decentralization  has  become  necessary  because  nobody  can  consciously balance  all  the  considerations  bearing  on  the  decisions  of  so  many individuals,  the  coordination  can  clearly  be  effected  not  by  “conscious control”  but  only  by  arrangements  which  convey  to  each  agent  the information he must possess in order effectively to adjust his decisions to those  of  others.  And  because  all  the  details  of  the  changes  constantly affecting the conditions of demand and supply of the different commodities can never be fully known, or quickly enough be collected and disseminated, by any one center, what is required is some apparatus of registration which automatically  records  all  the  relevant  effects  of  individual  actions  and whose indications are at the same time the resultant of, and the guide for, all the individual decisions.\n\n### Four: Single-minded Benefits\n\nIf all people use the same product, the costs could be limited least leading to a much lower price while the product would monopolize in corresponding area, then whether should we not to allow this happens? Hayek would say no, because it thwarts the developing of new inventions which benefits more in a long term to obtain an immediate interest. On the other hand, It's absurd that we destroy our most precious inheritance: liberty for the little welfare. Like simple-oriented thinkers, they're single-minded, so Hayek called, who being monopoly thrive the affairs only they value.

Mình muốn tự học trên mạng miễn phí hoặc với giá rẻ. Mình có thể học bằng Tiếng Anh nên không ngại bất kì nguồn học nào.\n\nĐiều đâu tiên mà mọi người hay làm đó là search google: “How to become a data analyst?”. Search google là đúng nhưng bạn không nên search như vậy, mình sẽ phân tích cơ chế google xuất ra kết quả và bạn cần chiến lược search thế nào để tận dụng cơ chế đó.\n\n### Matching keyword\n\n> How to become a data analyst?\n\nKhi search như trên, google sẽ cho ra kết quả giống với câu hỏi nhất → Tức là google sẽ ưu tiên kết quả tìm kiếm gồm tất cả các từ trong câu hỏi. Điều này giới hạn các kết quả của bạn, vì con người sẽ có nhiều cách dùng từ cho cùng 1 dạng câu hỏi, ví dụ: *“What do you need to become Data Analyst?”, “How to learn to be a Data Analyst?”,…*\n\nBạn cần dùng các từ keyword quan trọng trong câu hỏi, ở đây sẽ là: **How, become, data analyst**. Bỏ qua các từ không cần thiết như: do, you, to, be, a, an, the. Vậy câu hỏi bạn search sẽ là: **“How become data analyst”.**\n\n> “Chúng ta không thể hỏi những điều chúng ta không biết”. \n\nBằng việc gỡ bỏ giới hạn tìm kiếm, bạn có thể nhận lại kết quả tìm kiếm liên quan mà bạn không hề biết tới. Chúng sẽ cung cấp những thông tin và insight giá trị khi mình tìm kiếm thông tin về DA, ví dụ như: “How I become data analyst in 6 months”, “What skills to learn to become DA”, “How is a typical day of a DA?”,… Qua đó, các bạn biết thêm những trải nghiệm và góc nhìn khác nhau khi học và làm việc.\n\n### Search Google like a pro\n\n**“How become data analyst site:www.reddit.com.”**\n\nSử dụng `site` sau câu hỏi thì sẽ chỉ trả về kết quả tìm kiếm thuộc về website đó. Khi mình tìm hiểu về ngành Data Analyst thì mình sẽ tìm trên *Reddit* - nó là trang social media và diễn đàn lớn trên thế giới, hoặc *Youtube* vì có nhiều content chia sẻ rất chất lượng. Việc đọc các post chia sẻ, bình luận và coi video giúp mình hiểu về DA hơn cũng như những trải nghiệm của người trong nghề - điều này giúp mình có nhiều insight hơn về lĩnh vực đó.\n\n`Before/After:2019` : Trả về kết quả từ trước/sau 2019.\n\n2019`..`2020: Trả về kết quả trong khoảng thời gian 2019-2020.\n\nBằng cách giới hạn kết quả chỉ từ sau năm 2020, mình sẽ tránh được thông tin bị outdated, ví dụ như bạn muốn tìm nguồn học data analyst: **“resource learn data analyst site:www.reddit.com after:2020”** → Vì các nguồn học à công nghệ thay đổi rất nhanh, nên mình chỉ muốn tìm thông tin \\~2 năm gần đây, đồng thời cũng lọc ra được những resource chất lượng mà người khác vẫn còn đang sử dụng *(nhiều resource outdated không còn dùng được nữa).*\n\n`-Python`: Đặt dấu gạch ngang ở trước để tìm kết quả không có từ “Python”. \n\n**“Resource learn data analyst site:www.reddit.com after:2020 -Python”**. Trong lúc search, sẽ có những keyword dominate kết quả → Tức là chúng xuất hiện ở mọi kết quả và luôn ở đầu trang. Điều này rất khó chịu nếu bạn không muốn search keyword đó mà nó cứ xuất hiện, nên ta cần loại trừ keyword đó.\n\n## Tìm kiếm tài nguyên học \n\nCác bạn có thể tìm thấy tài liệu học trên internet như khoá học online, youtube video, sách, blog,… Nhưng vấn đề sẽ là tìm thế nào, chất lượng ra sao và phù hợp với mình không. Bạn không nên bắt đầu bằng việc lên thẳng youtube, google hay MOOC platforms để tìm trực tiếp mà hay tìm từ các nội dung chia sẻ.\n\n### Searching for courses\n\nSau khi tìm kiếm từ google và youtube thì mình tìm được các nguồn học tốt đã được tổng hợp trong 1 post trên Reddit:\n\n![Bài post trên Reddit](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8CE-XpmHrWOl5IVP-72FS.png?height=980&width=1545)\n\nCó 2 website để học là **DataCamp** và **DataQuest**, 2 khoá học trên **Coursera** của **IBM** và Google, còn có thêm vài Youtube channel của người trong Data industry. Theo kinh nghiệm cá nhân đã từng thử qua nhiều khoá học online thì:\n\n* **Coursera** thường chỉ cung cấp khoá học với kiến thức general và ở mức introduction. Không chuyên sâu, excercise và project trong khoá học cũng rất hạn chế và không sáng tạo. Thường chỉ phù hợp cho beginner không biết gì.\n* Với **DataCamp** hay **DataQuest**, cả 2 là E-learning platform tập trung vào lĩnh vực data, khác với Coursera, Edx hay Udemy - *MOOCs platform cung cấp khoá học trong nhiều lĩnh vực khác nhau.* \n\nĐối với các platform tập trung vào 1 mảng, chung sẽ cung cấp môi trường và tài nguyên học rất tốt cho lĩnh vực đó. Trong DataCamp và DataQuest, có nhiều tính năng quan trọng giúp đỡ quá trình học Data:\n\n* C*areer track/skill path/career path* → E-learning platform đó cung cấp các khoá học và sắp xếp chúng theo thứ tự để phù hợp với mục tiêu người học.\n* *Resource* → Gồm webinar, blog, podcast, video, cheatsheets, case study,… Nguồn tài nguyên này đa dạng hoá phương thức học và kiến thức.\n* *Cooperation* → Cho phép những người học kết nối với để cùng học, cùng làm project và networking. Tạo ra 1 community giữa người học.\n\n## Kết\n\nBằng việc sử dụng các phương pháp Google search, bạn có thể tìm được rất nhiều tài nguyên cho việc học. Internet cho bạn nguồn thông tin vô cùng lớn, quan trọng là chugns ta làm sao để truy cập, khai thác và tận dụng được lượng thông tin này. Mong những chia sẻ này sẽ giúp ích cho các bạn.", "timestamp": 1653400807, "digest": "r_5GXHKztTXWVNQFR192XlAJHoXRhpNVhJwIHaEPgoU", "contributor": "0xec2B504013e02b1D43eaC2F62568f4921870ab7E"}

Blitmap is celebrating its first anniversary of being on-chain! This issue of the Nifty Newsletter, a community-run missive, is very special, as it features my interview with Dom Hofmann and Totally about the past, present and future of Blitmap! This was an incredibly exciting conversation in which I learned about the comic and found out that the Blitnauts are █████ ████ ██ ████████, that Sugar is ████ ██ ██ ███ ████ ████████ ████ ████ and that Sup plans to ████ █ ████ ██ ███ ██████ ██ ████████.

I’m excited to not only see what is coming, but also to reminiscence a little about where we’ve been!\n\nEnough dillydallying—let’s get to the interview with Hofmann and Totally!\n\n## The Blitmap Origin Story\n\nWhile [Hofmann](https://twitter.com/dhof) has cemented himself as one of the most prolific artists and technologists in web3, it’s hard to believe that his first Solidity contract was Blitmap and [that it was deployed just over a year ago](https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1525832159851950081). Hofmann said that he had been involved with crypto since 2013—he purchased some Bitcoin then and later, in 2017, some Ethereum. But the space didn’t grip him as a creator, saying that he mostly “just watched the price go up and down.”\n\n![Hofmann's tweet on May 15, 2022 commemorating the year after deploying his first Solidity contract. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LaXUVvjTNsibXvBQwmY7b.png?height=550&width=898)\n\nWhile he is largely known as one of the creators of Vine, which was acquired by Twitter, Hofmann founded another company called Byte after he left Twitter. This company achieved a certain degree of success when there was a scare about the data sovereignty of TikTok in the summer of 2020. And while it was one of the most downloaded social networking apps in Apple’s App Store, it just couldn’t compete with the wide proliferation of TikTok.\n\nHofmann sold Byte to Discord and went to work for the company to help them drive creator revenue by empowering individuals to monetize Discord servers and communities. But it was at that time that he noticed that the NFT space was beginning to break out as a platform that could enable digital creators to derive value from their work.\n\n“I took the oldest Vine that still exists and listed it on Foundation just to see what that process was like,” Hofmann says. “That piece sold for almost nine Ethereum and it gave me a start on noncustodial ETH.”\n\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/77](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/77)\n\nWith the proceeds from the sale, Hofmann began going down the rabbit hole. He purchased a Cryptopunk and became interested in the technology and programming side of the web3 world. Hofmann dug into what it meant to write a Solidity contract and found this web3 work incredibly interesting. It ultimately led him to leave Discord even though he had not completed the vesting period from his sale of Byte.\n\nWhile he continued to produce 1/1 works with the off-the-shelf contracts for which Foundation, Rarible and a host of other services are known, Hofmann became fascinated with on-chain art. Hofmann was intrigued by the possibility of having the work itself housed in the Ethereum blockchain rather than hosted on a centralized server or a decentralized service such as ISPS. He began working on his own on-chain contracts.\n\n“I realized that there wasn’t much that was happening on-chain,” recalls Hofmann. “There was [Autoglyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs) \\[by Larva Labs\\], which was a big inspiration, and [Avastars](https://opensea.io/collection/avastar), an early PFP project. At the time, there wasn’t anything specifically around pixel art that was on-chain, so I started working on the Blitmap contract and learning Solidity at the same time.”\n\nDuring the time Hofmann began this experimentation on the Ethereum blockchain, he was an active member in a Discord server that [Totally](https://twitter.com/to_tal_ly) spun up for game developers and folks adjacent to the industry to connect and create during the pandemic.\n\nWith the popular press talking about NFTs, web3 was soon a topic of discussion in the Discord community as well. Hofmann raised the concept of Blitmap to the folks in the server and began formulating how originals and siblings would work. He began asking if anyone would be interested in contributing art within the constraints of a 32 by 32 pixel grid and using only four colors.\n\n![Jupiter Overloaded (#101), the first Blitmap sibling that Hofmann created.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5jSC_7lKMSXpYDVRznVas.png?height=1600&width=1600)\n\n“I was part of a group that started a Discord server for people in the gaming industry during the pandemic to keep our minds off stuff,” Totally, the co-founder of Sup and a Blitmap original artist explains. “We were just working at night and having fun without any constraints on our creativity. The only rule was ‘Don’t build an MMO.’ People were working on mobile games and digital art in a very free-flowing way. But then Dom came to us with this idea for Blitmap and it had constraints on size and colors for each piece. It really reminded me how much creativity comes from constraints.”\n\nWhile many of the artists came from the server, Hofmann also put out an open call for pixel artists on Twitter and opened other spots to people he had met in web3. The first artist (after Hofmann) to create a composition was [BRAINDRAIND](https://twitter.com/braindraind), who made Caffeinate (#74). And the first test run for making a sibling was the combination of Genesis and Caffeinate. Hofmann says that the collection was originally supposed to include 128 compositions (something that [BRAINDRAIND noted in a recent tweet about Blitmap’s anniversary](https://twitter.com/BrainDraind/status/1526064512876662787)), but after the first 100 compositions were completed, he was eager to launch the project to the world.\n\n![Tweet from BRAINDRAIND on May 15, 2022, Blitmap's first anniversary, that shows some of his \"Lost Blits\" that may have made the cut had the project been 128 compositions.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F7t-DBP3i7m-3KUA1fDEj.png?height=766&width=654)\n\n## Modest Expectations, Deliberate Action Led to Engaged Community\n\nAt the time, the prototype for most NFT collections was to release a collection of 10,000 animated profile pictures through a blind reveal, with traits having varying degrees of rarity. By the spring of 2021, bonding curves (in which a mint gets progressively more expensive) had fallen out of favor, replaced by a flat fee across the entire collection. This new kind of minting process, chosen by The Bored Ape Yacht Club, became the de facto standard in the space.\n\nBut Hofmann decided to deviate from this norm in two major ways:\n\n1. The Blitmap collection would consist of only 1,700 total pieces\n2. The person minting would be able to craft their NFT and know what they were getting\n\nThis was a paradigm shift in the space. The inherent lack of rarity (there are 16 siblings for each composition), coupled with friction where *the individual* had to craft their NFT instead of blindly smashing a mint button, was just not the way that these projects were supposed to work. This shift was one of the main reasons that Blitmap took over one month to mint out.\n\n![The original Blitmap minting site, now housed at http://blitmap.com/archive](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zZ7VV2xI8lLleVyN0OEqw.png?height=820&width=693)\n\n“My main goal was for the collection to be completed,” Hofmann says. “I thought about it all the time during the slow minting process. But to me it made a lot of sense that Blitmap wouldn’t be picked up in the same way as other projects, and that was good. People coming in were willing to appreciate what the friction in the minting process gave them and appreciate something that was novel.”\n\nThroughout the mint, the project began to gain steam. Curious individuals came to Blitmap because it *was* so different than the normal projects. Rather than picking an NFT blindly, people were given the ability to create the Blitmap that they wanted to have. These mints were celebrated in the Discord channel as they slowly trickled in, with observers excited to see what composition and palette combinations would be created next.\n\nThe Discord community was very welcoming, with Hofmann and the artists making a point to always greet newcomers and comment on the latest mints. And as people came on board, another quality of Blitmap came to unify the community: the understanding of what being “on-chain” meant. This was a quality that differentiated Blitmap drastically from other projects launched at that time.\n\nIn short, on-chain means that the data and information required to recreate the piece is stored immutably on the Ethereum blockchain. This lends a certain degree of permanence to a piece that has yet to be seen over the course of human history. On-chain artworks are (in large part) immune to environmental decay or armed conflicts—as long as the Ethereum blockchain is in existence, so too will be all 1700 Blitmaps. Because Blitmap was one of the earlier on-chain projects, many in the community became interested in how the blockchain was itself being used as an artistic medium.\n\nThe intrigue of an on-chain project, small number of holders, community crafting mechanics and long minting process have led to one of the most cohesive Discord channels in the space.\n\n“The friction of the minting process worked in our favor,” says Hofmann. “It not only took active effort to choose a composition and color palette, but also sort of a passive effort to understand what the project was in the first place. Many had a creative background or a technical background themselves, along with a good amount of curiosity. Those are all good traits for a community when you mix people together and give them a common thread of a storyline…. There is an active interest in what we are trying to achieve together and how we are going to do it—that makes the community very durable.”\n\n![First glimpse of what would become a web3 icon, Hofmann's Rose tweeted out on April 13, 2021.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2O7_eY7KR9xuWX6hK9ScB.png?height=678&width=894)\n\nWhile most people enter the NFT space with the goal of collecting a particular digital piece, that community crafted element has led many individuals to have a fair degree of affinity for the pieces that they minted. Even those who pick them up on the secondary understand that the Blit they have purchased was *created* by someone rather than algorithmically generated.\n\n“With Blitmap, there is more than just the secondary market to align around. There’s more than just the collectability,” Hofmann says. “If you’re wanting to build for the long term, that’s community-driven at its core. It’s OK to start smaller, to be deliberate and to do things with purpose. It doesn’t get you mega-scale and a pop right away, but I think over time it does work out.”\n\n## Most Surprising Things this Past Year\n\nEven though Blitmap was highly successful in a financial sense, the two things that most surprised the Sup, Inc. founders had nothing to do with the bottom line. In fact, what most surprised Totally was the widespread proliferation, acceptance and adoption of CC0, because the act of putting assets and intellectual property in the public domain runs counter to the traditional IP rights that most companies cling to. While [Nouns](http://nouns.wtf/) was the first major project to announce that their assets would be placed in the public domain, Hofmann (one of the ten original “Nounders”) and the [16 Blitmap artists voted shortly after to allow their originals to be in placed in the public domain as well](https://blitmap.mirror.xyz/b-ANHRCj78z9Qy6Dk-kgjOsFtIqoVsQAS5DNNygU10U).\n\n“CC0 is finding its cultural identity,” Totally says. “The entire culture is shifting in how it approaches creativity, and CC0 and web3 are a major part of it. You can see how on Discord people are sharing and collaborating in a very different way than we did three years ago—it is so inherent to web3 and the internet culture in general. And while there may be instances where CC0 is not a great fit, when it *does* work, on a long-term scale it is going to be incredible.”\n\nThe CC0 conversation has been front of mind for Totally and Hofmann as they have begun to staff the Sup offices in Manhattan. Totally says that many of the artists and creative directors are not familiar with web3 and NFTs, or often have a more jaded view of the space. But he notes that when he talks about CC0, their faces light up—it removes all the complexity around IP and just lets people create.\n\nHofmann agrees that the proliferation of CC0—and the different Blitmap compositions across other projects—was one of the most surprising things from this past year.\n\n![Due to the CC0 license, Blitmap iconography has popped up in other projects—check out the Logo composition on a hat as seen on Chain Runner #2150.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pfcisGRiBKy93K0H3jjCc.png?height=536&width=536)\n\n“It’s interesting to see the Blitmap logo on the [Chain Runners](https://chainrunners.xyz/) hat,” Hofmann says. “It’s interesting to see imprint on [polys.art](https://polys.art/). It’s interesting to see the Rose in all sorts of contexts. The [Blitwear](https://www.blitwear.com/) stuff has been amazing, and all the [merch that NiftyPins has created](http://blitstore.com) has been incredible. And even some of the concept work. I’m not surprised that all these things are happening, because you can zoom out and see how the public domain is so conducive to this creativity. But I am surprised at the quality of these things and how they are impacting the space.”\n\nAnother thing that has surprised both Hofmann and Totally is the number of holders who have “attuned” their Blitmap by [turning it into a Blitnaut](https://blitnauts.blitmap.com/). The duo hatched the idea for the Nauts while hanging out at a pool over a weekend getaway with their partners. After they became aware of the staying power of NFT PFPs, they decided they wanted to try this with the Blitmap collection.\n\n![Blitnaut #52, crafted by emrecolako and later traded to timshel to bring him into the Blitmap community.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YxOXz6lfHyxOOt44nYwnX.png?height=599&width=600)\n\nThus, the Blitnauts were born. As opposed to with most project expansion mechanics, an individual can create a Blitnaut from an “unattuned” Blitmap in perpetuity. While there have been some incentives to do so (such as the forthcoming Logos drop), there was no explicit time frame. Despite that, 1,505 Blitnauts (almost 89%!) of the totally supply has been minted at the time of publication, a fact that surprised Hofmann given how involved the process to create a Blitnaut can be.\n\n## An Eye Towards the Future\n\nAs we enter the second year of Blitmap, many Holders and people in the NFT community want to know what’s next. The duo have been teasing “Sup Summer” on Discord and Twitter with a number of sneak peeks and teasers. “We have a bunch of things that will be celebrated over the coming months,” Totally says, a little guarded about what’s about to unfold. “We’ve announced the Logos and the comic series and are still working on a few other things.”\n\n![The first cover of the Blitmap comic teased on May 16, 2022 in the Announcements channel on the Blitmap Discord server.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6BiHcirkMz87PXz1QzoAQ.png?height=2880&width=2880)\n\nIn tandem with these announcements, Sup has been actively building a team that is headquartered in Manhattan. Something that is exciting for Totally as he hopes to continue to round out the team over the next couple of months.\n\n“With every new person we hire, we get extra energy,” Totally offers. “It’s more momentum, more focus. Every new person is coming in and working on something cool and it is just exciting. No matter what the market is doing, Sup is staying true to ourselves and continuing to innovate in web3.”\n\n![A supposed glimpse into the Sup, Inc. office, as tweeted by @html on May 9, 2022.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-ZChiomzWTiFFxef_oVjb.png?height=647&width=746)\n\nWhile Logos have been in sight for a while, the other major project that has been announced so far is the comic. Holders got a glimpse of the cover, and many people have begun teasing out Easter eggs: the hidden 6, the rabbit, the mention of the Fragments of the Old Machine, which was hinted at in one of [Hofmann’s Sugar (Genesis) cards, Pluto’s Quill](https://rarible.com/token/0xcaea26bdccfa9090d056b6533a608c6157caa948:1). While he wouldn’t reveal many details, Hofmann said that (i) the writing and art was insane, (ii) a major publisher was backing the comic, (iii) it would be available in English and Japanese and (iv) it should significantly expand the awareness of the Blitmap universe, as it would be available in comic stores around the country!\n\nIn tribute to the origins of Blitmap, the comic will have a community-crafted element. Does this mean that Holders can vote on the storyline or the characters inside it? Maybe they can choose the covers? Or even decide who is good and bad? Time will tell, but Hofmann did write in Discord that these decisions will “shape future issues as well as the universe and canon.”\n\nBut Hofmann was quick to point out that this comic announcement is just the first of a string of announcements for Sup Summer.\n\n![Will we get more clarity into the role of Sugar (Genesis) in the Blitmap universe this year? And what action can the first card, Pluto's Quill, do? Time will tell!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NsV-n7OlnTRTgu-RjScQj.png?height=2250&width=4096)\n\n“Sup is announcing and releasing a lot of things starting this summer and through the fall,” he says. “After the comic announcement, Corruption(\\*s) chapter two begins, which I think will be pretty interesting. We follow that with the Logos release and will then begin work on our first formal release as Sup \\[i.e. not Blitmap\\]. After that, the comics will be shipping to stores, and then…”\n\nAccording to the founders, a key driver of these releases is that they want Sup and the Blitmap universe to break through to the mainstream and onboard new people to the space rather than just appealing to those already here. One way to do that is through physical collectibles, such as the comics; the other way is to provide more acceptable price points for newcomers while maintaining the scarcity of the original collection for the current holders.\n\n[Sugar (Genesis)](https://twitter.com/sugarthegame), the card game that Hofmann has been talking about and releasing in small batches this past year, looks to enter into the spotlight as the Superverse expands. Hofmann called this collection “extremely ambitious from a technological execution standpoint as well as in terms of artistic merit,” and noted that it has the potential to set some world records. “We’re taking big artistic swings,” he says.\n\nHofmann feels that Blitmap will be a cornerstone of whatever Sup builds.\n\n“From a theme perspective, Blitmap is closer to Nintendo’s Metroid. It’s more like science fiction or science fantasy,” Hofmann says. “However, in terms of proliferating the things we want to do with Sup, and just *the meaning of all of it*, Blitmap is closer to Mario. It’s just going to keep showing up and expanding. It’s a through line through everything.”\n\n## Nifty’s Nook\n\nHoly moly! Are y’all as hyped as I am?!?! Getting to talk with Dom and Totally was one of the most energizing conversations I’ve ever had in my life. The hour phone call ended up going well over two hours, and some of the things that they talked about were incredible!\n\nI tried to balance things that I could talk about and things that I was asked to keep in confidence. But my conviction in what Sup is doing to nurture open, fictional universes in web3 has only increased. There are several reasons for this:\n\n1. Sup is helmed by a team of builders with a tech-first focus. It appears that to make it in this space, you must combine both technological and artistic expertise. Blitmap was important not just purely because of the pixel art, but due to the technological mechanics of how that pixel art was stored on-chain along with the artistic direction of letting individuals craft their NFT.\n2. The team is growing. In a market where we’ve seen a lot of volatility and instability, Sup is heads down and building. The addition of theflamingskunk, along with the recent announcement of long time holder kaesha and four other new folks, has me excited to see what’s coming.\n3. They have an audacious goal. Dom and Totally aren’t looking simply to make a collection where “number go up.” Instead, they have a defined North Star to on-board new people to the space and, as [@html (who we know is somehow associated with Sup, probably Dom?) has said](https://twitter.com/html/status/1523694054151622656), “the goal is to create the most significant media and collectibles of the 21st century.”\n\nIf anyone can achieve this sort of audacious vision in this web3/NFT space, it is Sup. They have the vision, talent and integrity. I will be cheering them on as much as I can, and I am ready for Sup Summer!\n\nOne final note: I am so happy to be part of this Blitmap journey and to have met so many of you in the Holders channel. After reading one of Zeneca’s newsletters, I joined in midway through the mint and created City Looney (#821). From there, I minted a handful more and began picking up pieces on the secondary that I felt were important to the collection and wish I had minted.\n\n![The first Blitmap that I ever minted, City Looney (#821); big thanks to Zeneca for putting this project in his newsletter a year ago!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_kkNJb49HYX09eoa71NuA.png?height=1600&width=1600)\n\nI got to experience BlitDay (July 29) during the Summer of JPEGs, [while on an epic road trip](https://niftypins.io/blitmap-nft-excellent-adventure/), when we were all going crazy about hitting 100 ETH in total secondary sales. I pulled over on the side of the road during a road trip to be part of the [Blitsquad PartyBid for the Foundation piece](https://foundation.app/@blitmap). I’ve made a number of trades and sold a number of things to pick up pieces I’ve loved. From the mint price of 0.1 ETH, I saw the rise of Blitmap to 30ETH (!) and the subsequent fall back to Earth at 5ETH (!). And I enjoyed minting my Nauts.\n\nHowever, the best part is that I’ve seen a glimpse of what web3 *could* become by interacting with people in Holders. I’ve always believed that technology can be a great enabler and equalizer. I remember the lofty ideals of the first iteration of the web, which later gave way to SEO trickery and advertisements. I remember the joy in true connection to friends, family and people who shared like interests in the second iteration, which later devolved into algorithmic feeds that are optimized to divide us and keep us in echo chambers.\n\nI never thought that I’d see a third iteration of the web, and I certainly didn’t expect it to look like this. And we have a chance, albeit a very slim one, to get it right. While it’s likely that it will be ruined like the other iterations, seeing this incredible amount of creativity and collaboration gives me an inkling of hope that this iteration might be better.\n\nHere’s to the second year of Blitmap!\n\n*NiftyPins is a member of the Blitmap community—you can find him frequently hanging out in the [Blitmap Discord](https://discord.com/invite/blitmap) or on [Twitter at @niftypins](http://twitter.com/niftypins).*", "timestamp": 1653401104, "digest": "9xN5Gu5TYiiWBn3HIsjye5Cf7ISy8UxZGUKfqTnwhQI", "contributor": "0x836eF81A58e5565b8d1d555EC8E9a5c2792511c6"}
