Crypto enthusiasts say their vision for the web would decentralize it, pushing it closer to its roots.\n\nWeb3 advocates emphasize user privacy and ownership of data.\n\nCentralization has helped onboard billions of people to the World Wide Web and created the stable, robust infrastructure on which it lives. At the same time, a handful of centralized entities have a stronghold on large swathes of the World Wide Web, unilaterally deciding what should and should not be allowed.\n\nWeb3 is the answer to this dilemma. Instead of a Web monopolized by large technology companies, Web3 embraces decentralization and is being built, operated, and owned by its users.

If someone wants to watch a movie, they can go to Netflix and watch a movie in a matter of seconds. If someone wants to hear their favorite song, all they have to do is have an Apple Music account and they can stream all of the music they want. If someone wants to send money to their friend, they can use Cashapp, or use a multitude of apps to send crypto in a near instant fashion. With the ability to do a multitude of things instantly, why can’t people be paid their salary or wages in the manner that they chose? With blockchain technology, payment streaming is becoming possible.\n\nPayment streaming allows employees to receive real-time wages. For example, if someone wants to be paid daily, they can receive the payment the same day after labor has been performed. Contrast that to today’s payment system. Employees have to work two weeks and then the following week, they are paid. Now, this system is what many employees in the United States are accustomed to so there hasn’t been any disruption. To go into further detail regarding how the system works, the employers owe the employees for their time. Theoretically, the employers are in debt to the employees but the debt carries no interest, is not mutual, and is one-sided in favor of the employers. ** \n **\n\nContrasting the traditional system to streaming payments, the latter is easier for entities sending payments as there only needs to be a series of set parameters embedded in a smart contract. To give context on how this could work, tokens can be sent from employers to employees on a continuous basis depending on the rate of payment flow. For example, if someone is to be paid 1000 dollars a month, they could receive payments of 1 dollar and 39 cents an hour or 23 cents per minute. This flexibility allows for people to be paid on their desired time horizon such as hourly, daily, or weekly. \n\nAdditionally, with the advent of crypto streaming, employers can pay their employees by paying them in the token of the receiver’s choice. Imagine if employers were able to invest in their employees by paying them in whatever tokens they please. Although, at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency industry has taken a massive hit, getting paid in certain crypto assets can be deemed as a way to encourage wealth building.\n\nAnother point about the benefits of payment streaming is the reduced reliability of financial institutions. Financial institutions charge many types of fees, exchange rates, commissions and other charges that inconvenience their account holders. Additionally, financial institutions can control when the received funds are available for an account holder’s use which is yet another inconvenience caused by the traditional financial system. \n\nInconveniences caused by not streaming payments pose real-world consequences for people. Many people suffer from not budgeting properly and sometimes “life happens”, which causes a need for instant availability of funds. Currently, people who are faced with a challenging system are forced to go into debt by using credit cards or by dealing with an undesirable situation. Imagine if someone had a car issue that prevented them from driving. If this person doesn’t have the necessary funds to get their car serviced, they will have to deal with the inconveniences of finding another means of traveling until they have access to more funds in the next pay period. However, if these individuals were able to stream their funds, they could pay to service their car once they accumulated enough money. \n\nCurrently, there are few projects looking to develop ways to drive the possibility of payment streaming. These projects include [Superfluid](https://twitter.com/superfluid_hq?s=21&t=TQ0hhKE3YVhqgYWodV8ytw), [Streamflow](https://twitter.com/streamflow_fi?s=21&t=TQ0hhKE3YVhqgYWodV8ytw), and [Roketo](https://twitter.com/roketostream?s=21&t=BmFd1mwTgP2PbnEkssusaw). While this article has focused on primarily payment streaming for wages, these vendors offer a wide variety of use cases leveraging the principles of streaming payments. \n\nSuperfluid is a startup founded in 2020 by [Francesco George Renzi](https://twitter.com/francescorenzia?s=21&t=dKh-A-ylpVemIi0IgKrrEQ), Miao Miao, and [Michele D’Aliessi](https://twitter.com/micheledaliessi?s=21&t=iUfVqmNKEWz9jvhFd6JadA). In July of 2021, the team scored an investment of 9 million dollars from firms including [Multicoin Capital](https://twitter.com/multicoincap?lang=en), [DeFinance Capital](https://twitter.com/defiancecapital?lang=en), [Delphi Ventures](https://twitter.com/delphi_digital?s=21&t=RlA3a4zRKneEclyUUyDPZQ), [Semantic Ventures](https://twitter.com/semanticvc). The round also included angel investors such as [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis?s=21&t=RlA3a4zRKneEclyUUyDPZQ), [Stani Kulechov](https://twitter.com/stanikulechov?s=21&t=RlA3a4zRKneEclyUUyDPZQ), [Ryan Selkis](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot), and [David Hoffman](https://twitter.com/trustlessstate?s=21&t=Tie5dI57iuQ7NR7Tl-z1Xg). The project has also received support from DAOs such as [Metacartel Ventures](https://twitter.com/venture_dao?s=21&t=bQzg6TxN1CjM5PYGMiFz3g), [The LAO](https://twitter.com/thelaoofficial), and [Alliance DAO](https://twitter.com/alliancedao?s=21&t=Bm0D9ECQAH4n1zJIz23Viw). Superfluid facilitates streams on the Ethereum blockchain through its smart contract framework that allows users to transfer tokens or other digital assets on chain with a set of predefined rules called agreements. Currently, the project’s capabilities include payment streaming with gas less transfers, with real-time liquidity which allows its users to only require enough balance to keep their payment streams open. Furthermore, users do not incur a delay when withdrawing their funds. \n\nStreamflow is a startup founded in 2021 whose team includes [@imprfekt](https://twitter.com/imprfekt?s=21&t=HKaDWqeT71m1QOpdwiAzRA) and others. The platform is built on Solana and its current capabilities include streaming payments and token vesting with more options coming in the future such as a multisig wallet. In the future, Streamflow aims to expand cross-chain and onboard web2 projects onto the platform. Streamflow’s most recent round of funding was a 3.1 million dollar seed round with backers that include [Jump Crypto](https://mobile.twitter.com/jumpcryptohq), [Solana Ventures](https://twitter.com/solanaventures?lang=en), [GBV Capital](https://twitter.com/gbvofficial?lang=en), [AngelDAO](https://twitter.com/angeldaoorg), [Huobi Ventures](https://twitter.com/huobiventures?lang=en) and others. \n\nRoketo is another payment streaming platform built on the [NEAR protocol](https://twitter.com/nearprotocol?s=21&t=fbOfQH-ItSYRNF5qCpw58A) whose primary contributors come from Kikimora Labs. The core team includes [Taras Dovgal](https://twitter.com/tarasdovgal?s=21&t=M1qUr1bj0nbhFOfasGFgOw), [Olga Isaeva](https://twitter.com/olyflow?s=21&t=uhmNY24CggKkW3dNGRZqwg), [Vasilisa Versus](https://twitter.com/dcversus?s=21&t=TtmvHOfggCCZbllIIAOFsA), and over 20 others. Roketo is backed by [MetaWeb Ventures](https://mobile.twitter.com/metawebvc), [A&T Capital](https://twitter.com/ant_capital?s=21&t=vVrsk_8dA4U-LLSX4Qn4tQ),[Cogitent Ventures](https://twitter.com/cogitentv?s=21&t=zC-QgTxzxYj9dwbA31ldLQ), and [Move Capital](https://twitter.com/movecap?s=21&t=bbOzlhC0d07uGAI3Jwpacw). The company’s current capabilities include payroll, vesting, and airdropping. Regarding payroll, Rocket serves its customers by providing a quick solution to setting up wages for employees with transparency and low cost. Roketo advertises its ability to the preceding functions while also ensuring its customers have total control over their crypto currency. With regards to vesting, Roketo’s vesting product aids founders with streaming tokens to their investors as well as their employees. Within Roketo’s product, users can set cliffs for token distribution and keep distribution consistent. Lastly, for Rocketo’s airdrop offering, Roketo touts itself as the most affordable and intuitive product on the market. \n\nWith the aforementioned startups and most likely others who are focused on creating products to help users stream funds, one can imagine that there are implications of the success of this innovation. Payment streaming will provide more flexibility and create more control for people to have over their finances. This control can provide a way for people to determine the financial outcomes and create a way to adapt to life’s financial challenges easier. As mentioned before, these circumstances could allow users to have access to funds which could limit their reliance on credit, ultimately reducing debt. There are a multitude of use cases that payment streaming can benefit such as “subscription” models such as rent. Streaming payments benefit both parties of transactions as the requesting entity can trust that they will receive the payment continuously as opposed to in one lump sum payment. Ultimately, as this technology is adopted, it will be exciting to see how payment streaming will create a more fair, convenient, and mutually beneficial financial system.\n\n***If you LOVE this article, are you against sending a tip to Cryptojeter.eth?

Currently, the project’s capabilities include payment streaming with gas less transfers, with real-time liquidity which allows its users to only require enough balance to keep their payment streams open. Furthermore, users do not incur a delay when withdrawing their funds. \n\nStreamflow is a startup founded in 2021 whose team includes [@imprfekt](https://twitter.com/imprfekt?s=21&t=HKaDWqeT71m1QOpdwiAzRA) and others. The platform is built on Solana and its current capabilities include streaming payments and token vesting with more options coming in the future such as a multisig wallet. In the future, Streamflow aims to expand cross-chain and onboard web2 projects onto the platform. Streamflow’s most recent round of funding was a 3.1 million dollar seed round with backers that include [Jump Crypto](https://mobile.twitter.com/jumpcryptohq), [Solana Ventures](https://twitter.com/solanaventures?lang=en), [GBV Capital](https://twitter.com/gbvofficial?lang=en), [AngelDAO](https://twitter.com/angeldaoorg), [Huobi Ventures](https://twitter.com/huobiventures?lang=en) and others. \n\nRoketo is another payment streaming platform built on the [NEAR protocol](https://twitter.com/nearprotocol?s=21&t=fbOfQH-ItSYRNF5qCpw58A) whose primary contributors come from Kikimora Labs. The core team includes [Taras Dovgal](https://twitter.com/tarasdovgal?s=21&t=M1qUr1bj0nbhFOfasGFgOw), [Olga Isaeva](https://twitter.com/olyflow?s=21&t=uhmNY24CggKkW3dNGRZqwg), [Vasilisa Versus](https://twitter.com/dcversus?s=21&t=TtmvHOfggCCZbllIIAOFsA), and over 20 others. Roketo is backed by [MetaWeb Ventures](https://mobile.twitter.com/metawebvc), [A&T Capital](https://twitter.com/ant_capital?s=21&t=vVrsk_8dA4U-LLSX4Qn4tQ),[Cogitent Ventures](https://twitter.com/cogitentv?s=21&t=zC-QgTxzxYj9dwbA31ldLQ), and [Move Capital](https://twitter.com/movecap?s=21&t=bbOzlhC0d07uGAI3Jwpacw). The company’s current capabilities include payroll, vesting, and airdropping. Regarding payroll, Rocket serves its customers by providing a quick solution to setting up wages for employees with transparency and low cost. Roketo advertises its ability to the preceding functions while also ensuring its customers have total control over their crypto currency. With regards to vesting, Roketo’s vesting product aids founders with streaming tokens to their investors as well as their employees. Within Roketo’s product, users can set cliffs for token distribution and keep distribution consistent. Lastly, for Rocketo’s airdrop offering, Roketo touts itself as the most affordable and intuitive product on the market. \n\nWith the aforementioned startups and most likely others who are focused on creating products to help users stream funds, one can imagine that there are implications of the success of this innovation. Payment streaming will provide more flexibility and create more control for people to have over their finances. This control can provide a way for people to determine the financial outcomes and create a way to adapt to life’s financial challenges easier. As mentioned before, these circumstances could allow users to have access to funds which could limit their reliance on credit, ultimately reducing debt. There are a multitude of use cases that payment streaming can benefit such as “subscription” models such as rent. Streaming payments benefit both parties of transactions as the requesting entity can trust that they will receive the payment continuously as opposed to in one lump sum payment. Ultimately, as this technology is adopted, it will be exciting to see how payment streaming will create a more fair, convenient, and mutually beneficial financial system.\n\n***If you LOVE this article, are you against sending a tip to Cryptojeter.eth?

"目前市面上加密货币钱包的种类繁多，但大多数钱包的使用技巧和操作你都真正的了解和掌握吗？而且我们能通过钱包这个便利窗口进入到一个庞大繁华的区块链世界，钱包不仅仅是一个转移存取代币的工具，而且它有非常多的其他实用功能，我们以下谈论点主要以市面上使用率最高的热门的钱包metamask小狐狸为例展开讲解以及由钱包的使用延伸到区块链浏览器的使用\n\n**1，语言的选择**\n\n小狐狸钱包是目前使用最为广泛的数字货币钱包，小狐狸钱包有两种版本的下载方式，通过电脑端Google商店安装浏览器插件版本和手机下载APP版本，两种版本的使用功能差不多，首先下载好钱包后，为了便于个人的使用习惯选择适合自己的的语言系统，我们可以通过如下操作完成语言设置\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F_GT72eAfyQI8zEPyF2wKg.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**2，助记词**\n\n通过设置中点击安全与隐私找到钱包的助记词，助记词和私匙是钱包最为重要的密码，掌握其中任一种即可在不需要密码的情况下开启钱包，并且这两样东西若是丢失，钱包中功能不会有任何备份，所以一定要保存好这两样东西\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FFYXkCktfXpesL2CCKVz8f.png\\&w=1920\\&q=90)\n\n**3，钱包网络状态**\n\n有一点需要注意，有的人在添加测试网络时，出现无法添加的情况，一般是因为关闭了钱包的测试网络添加按钮，通过设置按钮点开启动即可\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fwn2ClY1D7zVHcGWEbLXxo.png\\&w=1920\\&q=90)\n\n**4，钱包常规功能**\n\n我们能轻松便捷的通过小狐狸钱包内置功能完成转账，收款，购买，和兑换等功能，你需要知道在完成购买或者兑换时会收取大概1%的手续费（通过兑换功能兑换代币也会有代币的损失我们通常称之为无偿损失，这也无法避免。）\n\n**但我们可以通过点击“高级选项”调节兑换“滑点”来减少损失（在允许的范围内调节滑点大小），滑点百分比调节越小，兑换成功率会受到影响，所以通常选择一个合适的范围调节点1%—3%之间，滑点百分比越高成功的几率越高，但损失也会越大**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F6TZ3sLZT2qykfgYmYd6ih.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n通过第3步的方式可以查看我们过往交互链接过的项目，如果曾经链接过的项目忘记了可以通过这种方式找到，也能通过这种方式掐断钱包和项目的默认链接状态或者点击4步直接断开与该项目的链接状态\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fu9nQLZRsuhbDjdy7ho\\_7H.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**5，交互卡链情况的处理**\n\n对于链上交互遇到比较拥堵的时候，严重的情况下一笔交易可能会卡住一两天，这种情况下我们应该怎么去处理掉这笔卡链交易（如果这种严重拥堵状况再次加手续费都无法完成），通常我们可以通过两种方式解决：\n\n第一种比较直接的方式挤掉所有前面未完成的交易，直接再次通过其他方式交互完成下一笔交易，在交易的时候，通过设置实时汽油费（这时设置GAS汽油费就应该根据当时情况设置更高数值才能顺利完成）\n\n第二种方式是点开钱包的设置找到“高级”选项功能启用自定义交易\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fy1VMd_ow3GZrLwMmMgQzU.png\\&w=1920\\&q=90)\n\n点击钱包的“活动”按钮找到最近的的一笔卡链未完成的交易找到nonce比如我这个是“132”记下这个数字，那么要挤掉这个未完成的交易，再下一次的交易中自定义就填写133，就会顺利过渡到下一笔交易\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F-iqEAgZvs6c6I2qHZQ3kj.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n小狐狸钱包它本身自带的链网络不多，我们可以通过如下网站自动添加所需要的各种网络，非常方便\n\n**二，区块浏览器的使用**\n\n通过钱包完成的链上交易我们可以通过钱包窗口进入到区块浏览器查看，区块浏览器会显示出此钱包所有在链上的活动痕迹，无处遁形，这也恰恰展示了区块链去中心化的魅力所在，学会使用它你可以查到任意钱包地址的持币情况和交易细节，更有助于了解区块链项目的背后的代币运行逻辑通过点击1，2步进入区块浏览器\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F9cnF0MsL_j8znMR35vit5.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**1，重要数据检索**\n\n在区块浏览器中我们能查看很多重要的数据信息，比如某个钱包地址状态是在卖出还是买入代币，代币时间线，代币来源，去往和获取方式等\n\n每个代币都有一个合约地址，我们可以像查询钱包地址一样，在检索栏输入这个合约地址这个合约地址所代表的代币信息都会被检索出来\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FKb9vHfsJvB8y7Wze-ytAb.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n在1中输入（上图所示）某个代币的名称，合约地址，以及哈希数能看到这个输入代号的所有链上情况\n\n在2中点开下拉键，能看到所有此钱包的代币，如果钱包中没有显示拥有的代币，可以通过这种方式获取代币合约添加到钱包中，比如我们要添加USDC代币到钱包，通过进入区块链浏览器，点击1，找到2中的的USDC，点开\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FctQkC6JiCySyg_GFO9YXO.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n就可以看到右边红框中的一串数字字母混合就是USDC的合约地址，复制合约地址，回到钱包下拉找到导入代币按钮，输入合约地址就可以成功添加代币名称到钱包\n\n**2，代币各种数据的位置**\n\n通过检索USDC代币，我们能看到USDC在链上的所有信息，这个地址钱包里代币的种类、代币名称、代币总供应量、总的持币地址数、价格、24小时涨跌幅度，当时市值，在偏右边的这个信息中可以看到USDC的合约地址、精度、官方网站、社交媒体链接等\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FefqBCgpmM8Eeg9YlMCKjq.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**3，“Transaction”及其他**\n\n在3中我们通过“[Transactions](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd58af9f90ebb67d4400a1268fae5fbcadab44777#transactions)”列查看这个钱包所有的代币活动行为：包括时间线，通过什么方式获得的代币（转账，swap，claim等等）代币时间线，代币来源，去往等\n\n交易的哈希值、区块高度、交易时间、被调用的合约地址、交易的以太币数量、交易耗费的Gas以及后面分类的代币列表：ERC-20(代币）,ERC-721（NFT）,ERC-1155(NFT)\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F-AwoWphsELMkKp2JRUkrS.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**4，持币地址的分布**\n\n在页面下半部分，有一个非常重要信息：持币地址的分布\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fhn5VdCD9cRdjVBKtnzudd.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n在上图的界面里，持有USDC代币的地址由多到少依次排列，包括持币者的排名、地址、持币数量，以及占总供应量的百分比和对应的美元计价市值。\n\n这个界面可以探寻到非常多的重要信息。比如哪些著名地址持有了USDC；USDC的大户之间有没有代币转移，甚至抛售出货等等\n\n某个币种价格的波动，往往都会包含在这些消息中。当你决定进行某个项目的代币买卖时，这些信息显得非常重要，往往可以看清项目方背后言语的真实发展路径和用意。\n\n区块浏览器蕴含一个发币项目很多重要数据，由于篇幅原因没有做过多深入讲解，希望能给带给大家一些对区块浏览器使用的启发性思维。\n\n![本文作者：SnapFingersDAO内容部--@maik2hello](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F_R5mgmAZg3aEcVJkLSYl0.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n本文作者：SnapFingersDAO内容部--\\@maik2hello\n\n**SnapFingersDAO响指精选知识库：**\n\n**掌握更多币圈价值信息关注推特：**\n",
