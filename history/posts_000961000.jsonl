Crypto enthusiasts say their vision for the web would decentralize it, pushing it closer to its roots.\n\nWeb3 advocates emphasize user privacy and ownership of data.\n\nCentralization has helped onboard billions of people to the World Wide Web and created the stable, robust infrastructure on which it lives. At the same time, a handful of centralized entities have a stronghold on large swathes of the World Wide Web, unilaterally deciding what should and should not be allowed.\n\nWeb3 is the answer to this dilemma. Instead of a Web monopolized by large technology companies, Web3 embraces decentralization and is being built, operated, and owned by its users.

If someone wants to watch a movie, they can go to Netflix and watch a movie in a matter of seconds. If someone wants to hear their favorite song, all they have to do is have an Apple Music account and they can stream all of the music they want. If someone wants to send money to their friend, they can use Cashapp, or use a multitude of apps to send crypto in a near instant fashion. With the ability to do a multitude of things instantly, why can’t people be paid their salary or wages in the manner that they chose? With blockchain technology, payment streaming is becoming possible.\n\nPayment streaming allows employees to receive real-time wages. For example, if someone wants to be paid daily, they can receive the payment the same day after labor has been performed. Contrast that to today’s payment system. Employees have to work two weeks and then the following week, they are paid. Now, this system is what many employees in the United States are accustomed to so there hasn’t been any disruption. To go into further detail regarding how the system works, the employers owe the employees for their time. Theoretically, the employers are in debt to the employees but the debt carries no interest, is not mutual, and is one-sided in favor of the employers. ** \n **\n\nContrasting the traditional system to streaming payments, the latter is easier for entities sending payments as there only needs to be a series of set parameters embedded in a smart contract. To give context on how this could work, tokens can be sent from employers to employees on a continuous basis depending on the rate of payment flow. For example, if someone is to be paid 1000 dollars a month, they could receive payments of 1 dollar and 39 cents an hour or 23 cents per minute. This flexibility allows for people to be paid on their desired time horizon such as hourly, daily, or weekly. \n\nAdditionally, with the advent of crypto streaming, employers can pay their employees by paying them in the token of the receiver’s choice. Imagine if employers were able to invest in their employees by paying them in whatever tokens they please. Although, at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency industry has taken a massive hit, getting paid in certain crypto assets can be deemed as a way to encourage wealth building.\n\nAnother point about the benefits of payment streaming is the reduced reliability of financial institutions. Financial institutions charge many types of fees, exchange rates, commissions and other charges that inconvenience their account holders. Additionally, financial institutions can control when the received funds are available for an account holder’s use which is yet another inconvenience caused by the traditional financial system. \n\nInconveniences caused by not streaming payments pose real-world consequences for people. Many people suffer from not budgeting properly and sometimes “life happens”, which causes a need for instant availability of funds. Currently, people who are faced with a challenging system are forced to go into debt by using credit cards or by dealing with an undesirable situation. Imagine if someone had a car issue that prevented them from driving. If this person doesn’t have the necessary funds to get their car serviced, they will have to deal with the inconveniences of finding another means of traveling until they have access to more funds in the next pay period. However, if these individuals were able to stream their funds, they could pay to service their car once they accumulated enough money. \n\nCurrently, there are few projects looking to develop ways to drive the possibility of payment streaming. These projects include [Superfluid](https://twitter.com/superfluid_hq?s=21&t=TQ0hhKE3YVhqgYWodV8ytw), [Streamflow](https://twitter.com/streamflow_fi?s=21&t=TQ0hhKE3YVhqgYWodV8ytw), and [Roketo](https://twitter.com/roketostream?s=21&t=BmFd1mwTgP2PbnEkssusaw). While this article has focused on primarily payment streaming for wages, these vendors offer a wide variety of use cases leveraging the principles of streaming payments. \n\nSuperfluid is a startup founded in 2020 by [Francesco George Renzi](https://twitter.com/francescorenzia?s=21&t=dKh-A-ylpVemIi0IgKrrEQ), Miao Miao, and [Michele D’Aliessi](https://twitter.com/micheledaliessi?s=21&t=iUfVqmNKEWz9jvhFd6JadA). In July of 2021, the team scored an investment of 9 million dollars from firms including [Multicoin Capital](https://twitter.com/multicoincap?lang=en), [DeFinance Capital](https://twitter.com/defiancecapital?lang=en), [Delphi Ventures](https://twitter.com/delphi_digital?s=21&t=RlA3a4zRKneEclyUUyDPZQ), [Semantic Ventures](https://twitter.com/semanticvc). The round also included angel investors such as [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis?s=21&t=RlA3a4zRKneEclyUUyDPZQ), [Stani Kulechov](https://twitter.com/stanikulechov?s=21&t=RlA3a4zRKneEclyUUyDPZQ), [Ryan Selkis](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot), and [David Hoffman](https://twitter.com/trustlessstate?s=21&t=Tie5dI57iuQ7NR7Tl-z1Xg). The project has also received support from DAOs such as [Metacartel Ventures](https://twitter.com/venture_dao?s=21&t=bQzg6TxN1CjM5PYGMiFz3g), [The LAO](https://twitter.com/thelaoofficial), and [Alliance DAO](https://twitter.com/alliancedao?s=21&t=Bm0D9ECQAH4n1zJIz23Viw). Superfluid facilitates streams on the Ethereum blockchain through its smart contract framework that allows users to transfer tokens or other digital assets on chain with a set of predefined rules called agreements. Currently, the project’s capabilities include payment streaming with gas less transfers, with real-time liquidity which allows its users to only require enough balance to keep their payment streams open. Furthermore, users do not incur a delay when withdrawing their funds. \n\nStreamflow is a startup founded in 2021 whose team includes [@imprfekt](https://twitter.com/imprfekt?s=21&t=HKaDWqeT71m1QOpdwiAzRA) and others. The platform is built on Solana and its current capabilities include streaming payments and token vesting with more options coming in the future such as a multisig wallet. In the future, Streamflow aims to expand cross-chain and onboard web2 projects onto the platform. Streamflow’s most recent round of funding was a 3.1 million dollar seed round with backers that include [Jump Crypto](https://mobile.twitter.com/jumpcryptohq), [Solana Ventures](https://twitter.com/solanaventures?lang=en), [GBV Capital](https://twitter.com/gbvofficial?lang=en), [AngelDAO](https://twitter.com/angeldaoorg), [Huobi Ventures](https://twitter.com/huobiventures?lang=en) and others. \n\nRoketo is another payment streaming platform built on the [NEAR protocol](https://twitter.com/nearprotocol?s=21&t=fbOfQH-ItSYRNF5qCpw58A) whose primary contributors come from Kikimora Labs. The core team includes [Taras Dovgal](https://twitter.com/tarasdovgal?s=21&t=M1qUr1bj0nbhFOfasGFgOw), [Olga Isaeva](https://twitter.com/olyflow?s=21&t=uhmNY24CggKkW3dNGRZqwg), [Vasilisa Versus](https://twitter.com/dcversus?s=21&t=TtmvHOfggCCZbllIIAOFsA), and over 20 others. Roketo is backed by [MetaWeb Ventures](https://mobile.twitter.com/metawebvc), [A&T Capital](https://twitter.com/ant_capital?s=21&t=vVrsk_8dA4U-LLSX4Qn4tQ),[Cogitent Ventures](https://twitter.com/cogitentv?s=21&t=zC-QgTxzxYj9dwbA31ldLQ), and [Move Capital](https://twitter.com/movecap?s=21&t=bbOzlhC0d07uGAI3Jwpacw). The company’s current capabilities include payroll, vesting, and airdropping. Regarding payroll, Rocket serves its customers by providing a quick solution to setting up wages for employees with transparency and low cost. Roketo advertises its ability to the preceding functions while also ensuring its customers have total control over their crypto currency. With regards to vesting, Roketo’s vesting product aids founders with streaming tokens to their investors as well as their employees. Within Roketo’s product, users can set cliffs for token distribution and keep distribution consistent. Lastly, for Rocketo’s airdrop offering, Roketo touts itself as the most affordable and intuitive product on the market. \n\nWith the aforementioned startups and most likely others who are focused on creating products to help users stream funds, one can imagine that there are implications of the success of this innovation. Payment streaming will provide more flexibility and create more control for people to have over their finances. This control can provide a way for people to determine the financial outcomes and create a way to adapt to life’s financial challenges easier. As mentioned before, these circumstances could allow users to have access to funds which could limit their reliance on credit, ultimately reducing debt. There are a multitude of use cases that payment streaming can benefit such as “subscription” models such as rent. Streaming payments benefit both parties of transactions as the requesting entity can trust that they will receive the payment continuously as opposed to in one lump sum payment. Ultimately, as this technology is adopted, it will be exciting to see how payment streaming will create a more fair, convenient, and mutually beneficial financial system.\n\n***If you LOVE this article, are you against sending a tip to Cryptojeter.eth?

Currently, the project’s capabilities include payment streaming with gas less transfers, with real-time liquidity which allows its users to only require enough balance to keep their payment streams open. Furthermore, users do not incur a delay when withdrawing their funds. \n\nStreamflow is a startup founded in 2021 whose team includes [@imprfekt](https://twitter.com/imprfekt?s=21&t=HKaDWqeT71m1QOpdwiAzRA) and others. The platform is built on Solana and its current capabilities include streaming payments and token vesting with more options coming in the future such as a multisig wallet. In the future, Streamflow aims to expand cross-chain and onboard web2 projects onto the platform. Streamflow’s most recent round of funding was a 3.1 million dollar seed round with backers that include [Jump Crypto](https://mobile.twitter.com/jumpcryptohq), [Solana Ventures](https://twitter.com/solanaventures?lang=en), [GBV Capital](https://twitter.com/gbvofficial?lang=en), [AngelDAO](https://twitter.com/angeldaoorg), [Huobi Ventures](https://twitter.com/huobiventures?lang=en) and others. \n\nRoketo is another payment streaming platform built on the [NEAR protocol](https://twitter.com/nearprotocol?s=21&t=fbOfQH-ItSYRNF5qCpw58A) whose primary contributors come from Kikimora Labs. The core team includes [Taras Dovgal](https://twitter.com/tarasdovgal?s=21&t=M1qUr1bj0nbhFOfasGFgOw), [Olga Isaeva](https://twitter.com/olyflow?s=21&t=uhmNY24CggKkW3dNGRZqwg), [Vasilisa Versus](https://twitter.com/dcversus?s=21&t=TtmvHOfggCCZbllIIAOFsA), and over 20 others. Roketo is backed by [MetaWeb Ventures](https://mobile.twitter.com/metawebvc), [A&T Capital](https://twitter.com/ant_capital?s=21&t=vVrsk_8dA4U-LLSX4Qn4tQ),[Cogitent Ventures](https://twitter.com/cogitentv?s=21&t=zC-QgTxzxYj9dwbA31ldLQ), and [Move Capital](https://twitter.com/movecap?s=21&t=bbOzlhC0d07uGAI3Jwpacw). The company’s current capabilities include payroll, vesting, and airdropping. Regarding payroll, Rocket serves its customers by providing a quick solution to setting up wages for employees with transparency and low cost. Roketo advertises its ability to the preceding functions while also ensuring its customers have total control over their crypto currency. With regards to vesting, Roketo’s vesting product aids founders with streaming tokens to their investors as well as their employees. Within Roketo’s product, users can set cliffs for token distribution and keep distribution consistent. Lastly, for Rocketo’s airdrop offering, Roketo touts itself as the most affordable and intuitive product on the market. \n\nWith the aforementioned startups and most likely others who are focused on creating products to help users stream funds, one can imagine that there are implications of the success of this innovation. Payment streaming will provide more flexibility and create more control for people to have over their finances. This control can provide a way for people to determine the financial outcomes and create a way to adapt to life’s financial challenges easier. As mentioned before, these circumstances could allow users to have access to funds which could limit their reliance on credit, ultimately reducing debt. There are a multitude of use cases that payment streaming can benefit such as “subscription” models such as rent. Streaming payments benefit both parties of transactions as the requesting entity can trust that they will receive the payment continuously as opposed to in one lump sum payment. Ultimately, as this technology is adopted, it will be exciting to see how payment streaming will create a more fair, convenient, and mutually beneficial financial system.\n\n***If you LOVE this article, are you against sending a tip to Cryptojeter.eth?

"目前市面上加密货币钱包的种类繁多，但大多数钱包的使用技巧和操作你都真正的了解和掌握吗？而且我们能通过钱包这个便利窗口进入到一个庞大繁华的区块链世界，钱包不仅仅是一个转移存取代币的工具，而且它有非常多的其他实用功能，我们以下谈论点主要以市面上使用率最高的热门的钱包metamask小狐狸为例展开讲解以及由钱包的使用延伸到区块链浏览器的使用\n\n**1，语言的选择**\n\n小狐狸钱包是目前使用最为广泛的数字货币钱包，小狐狸钱包有两种版本的下载方式，通过电脑端Google商店安装浏览器插件版本和手机下载APP版本，两种版本的使用功能差不多，首先下载好钱包后，为了便于个人的使用习惯选择适合自己的的语言系统，我们可以通过如下操作完成语言设置\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F_GT72eAfyQI8zEPyF2wKg.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**2，助记词**\n\n通过设置中点击安全与隐私找到钱包的助记词，助记词和私匙是钱包最为重要的密码，掌握其中任一种即可在不需要密码的情况下开启钱包，并且这两样东西若是丢失，钱包中功能不会有任何备份，所以一定要保存好这两样东西\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FFYXkCktfXpesL2CCKVz8f.png\\&w=1920\\&q=90)\n\n**3，钱包网络状态**\n\n有一点需要注意，有的人在添加测试网络时，出现无法添加的情况，一般是因为关闭了钱包的测试网络添加按钮，通过设置按钮点开启动即可\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fwn2ClY1D7zVHcGWEbLXxo.png\\&w=1920\\&q=90)\n\n**4，钱包常规功能**\n\n我们能轻松便捷的通过小狐狸钱包内置功能完成转账，收款，购买，和兑换等功能，你需要知道在完成购买或者兑换时会收取大概1%的手续费（通过兑换功能兑换代币也会有代币的损失我们通常称之为无偿损失，这也无法避免。）\n\n**但我们可以通过点击“高级选项”调节兑换“滑点”来减少损失（在允许的范围内调节滑点大小），滑点百分比调节越小，兑换成功率会受到影响，所以通常选择一个合适的范围调节点1%—3%之间，滑点百分比越高成功的几率越高，但损失也会越大**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F6TZ3sLZT2qykfgYmYd6ih.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n通过第3步的方式可以查看我们过往交互链接过的项目，如果曾经链接过的项目忘记了可以通过这种方式找到，也能通过这种方式掐断钱包和项目的默认链接状态或者点击4步直接断开与该项目的链接状态\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fu9nQLZRsuhbDjdy7ho\\_7H.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**5，交互卡链情况的处理**\n\n对于链上交互遇到比较拥堵的时候，严重的情况下一笔交易可能会卡住一两天，这种情况下我们应该怎么去处理掉这笔卡链交易（如果这种严重拥堵状况再次加手续费都无法完成），通常我们可以通过两种方式解决：\n\n第一种比较直接的方式挤掉所有前面未完成的交易，直接再次通过其他方式交互完成下一笔交易，在交易的时候，通过设置实时汽油费（这时设置GAS汽油费就应该根据当时情况设置更高数值才能顺利完成）\n\n第二种方式是点开钱包的设置找到“高级”选项功能启用自定义交易\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fy1VMd_ow3GZrLwMmMgQzU.png\\&w=1920\\&q=90)\n\n点击钱包的“活动”按钮找到最近的的一笔卡链未完成的交易找到nonce比如我这个是“132”记下这个数字，那么要挤掉这个未完成的交易，再下一次的交易中自定义就填写133，就会顺利过渡到下一笔交易\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F-iqEAgZvs6c6I2qHZQ3kj.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n小狐狸钱包它本身自带的链网络不多，我们可以通过如下网站自动添加所需要的各种网络，非常方便\n\n**二，区块浏览器的使用**\n\n通过钱包完成的链上交易我们可以通过钱包窗口进入到区块浏览器查看，区块浏览器会显示出此钱包所有在链上的活动痕迹，无处遁形，这也恰恰展示了区块链去中心化的魅力所在，学会使用它你可以查到任意钱包地址的持币情况和交易细节，更有助于了解区块链项目的背后的代币运行逻辑通过点击1，2步进入区块浏览器\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F9cnF0MsL_j8znMR35vit5.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**1，重要数据检索**\n\n在区块浏览器中我们能查看很多重要的数据信息，比如某个钱包地址状态是在卖出还是买入代币，代币时间线，代币来源，去往和获取方式等\n\n每个代币都有一个合约地址，我们可以像查询钱包地址一样，在检索栏输入这个合约地址这个合约地址所代表的代币信息都会被检索出来\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FKb9vHfsJvB8y7Wze-ytAb.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n在1中输入（上图所示）某个代币的名称，合约地址，以及哈希数能看到这个输入代号的所有链上情况\n\n在2中点开下拉键，能看到所有此钱包的代币，如果钱包中没有显示拥有的代币，可以通过这种方式获取代币合约添加到钱包中，比如我们要添加USDC代币到钱包，通过进入区块链浏览器，点击1，找到2中的的USDC，点开\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FctQkC6JiCySyg_GFO9YXO.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n就可以看到右边红框中的一串数字字母混合就是USDC的合约地址，复制合约地址，回到钱包下拉找到导入代币按钮，输入合约地址就可以成功添加代币名称到钱包\n\n**2，代币各种数据的位置**\n\n通过检索USDC代币，我们能看到USDC在链上的所有信息，这个地址钱包里代币的种类、代币名称、代币总供应量、总的持币地址数、价格、24小时涨跌幅度，当时市值，在偏右边的这个信息中可以看到USDC的合约地址、精度、官方网站、社交媒体链接等\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FefqBCgpmM8Eeg9YlMCKjq.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**3，“Transaction”及其他**\n\n在3中我们通过“[Transactions](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd58af9f90ebb67d4400a1268fae5fbcadab44777#transactions)”列查看这个钱包所有的代币活动行为：包括时间线，通过什么方式获得的代币（转账，swap，claim等等）代币时间线，代币来源，去往等\n\n交易的哈希值、区块高度、交易时间、被调用的合约地址、交易的以太币数量、交易耗费的Gas以及后面分类的代币列表：ERC-20(代币）,ERC-721（NFT）,ERC-1155(NFT)\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F-AwoWphsELMkKp2JRUkrS.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**4，持币地址的分布**\n\n在页面下半部分，有一个非常重要信息：持币地址的分布\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fhn5VdCD9cRdjVBKtnzudd.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n在上图的界面里，持有USDC代币的地址由多到少依次排列，包括持币者的排名、地址、持币数量，以及占总供应量的百分比和对应的美元计价市值。\n\n这个界面可以探寻到非常多的重要信息。比如哪些著名地址持有了USDC；USDC的大户之间有没有代币转移，甚至抛售出货等等\n\n某个币种价格的波动，往往都会包含在这些消息中。当你决定进行某个项目的代币买卖时，这些信息显得非常重要，往往可以看清项目方背后言语的真实发展路径和用意。\n\n区块浏览器蕴含一个发币项目很多重要数据，由于篇幅原因没有做过多深入讲解，希望能给带给大家一些对区块浏览器使用的启发性思维。\n\n![本文作者：SnapFingersDAO内容部--@maik2hello](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F_R5mgmAZg3aEcVJkLSYl0.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n本文作者：SnapFingersDAO内容部--\\@maik2hello\n\n**SnapFingersDAO响指精选知识库：**\n\n**掌握更多币圈价值信息关注推特：**\n",

The global market for carbon credits is expected to be worth $1 billion by 2021, and the industry has already seen record highs in both volume and value.\n\nCarbon credits are financial products that represent 1 ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere. They can be purchased by individuals or companies in order to offset emissions from things like industrial production, delivery vehicles, or travel. The most common way of creating carbon credits is through agricultural or forestry practices, but nearly any project that reduces emissions can generate them.\n\nThe growth of the carbon credit market reflects a growing awareness of climate change and its effects on our planet. Governments are increasingly putting pressure on businesses to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and many large companies see buying carbon credits as an efficient way to meet those targets.\n\nWhat is the compliance market for carbon credits? A carbon credit is a certificate or permit representing the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Governments set a cap on how many tons of emissions certain sectors can release, and this is known as a cap-and-trade market. The cap represents the amount of greenhouse gases a government will allow to be released into the atmosphere, and emitters must trade to stay within that limit. So far, about 64 carbon compliance markets are now in operation around the world. The compliance market for carbon credits has been growing rapidly in recent years as countries have looked for ways to reduce their emissions and meet their climate change goals. In order to participate in these markets, companies must first become certified by an accredited body such as The Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) or The Gold Standard Foundation (GSF). Certification involves verifying that projects reduce emissions by an amount equal to or greater than what they claim on their application. Once certified, companies can sell their credits through online exchanges or directly to buyers such as governments or other businesses looking for ways to comply with emission caps set by regulators.\n\nThe carbon credit market is growing rapidly as companies and countries seek to reduce their emissions. The European compliance market projects that carbon prices will increase 88 percent by 2030, while the voluntary market is experiencing rapid growth. This growth is being driven by corporate net-zero goals and interest in meeting international climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement. \n \n\nVoluntary emissions reductions are those that companies make to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. This can be done through a number of methods, including investing in renewable energy or carbon credits. Voluntary reductions are not mandatory, meaning companies are not required to participate. Instead, they choose to do so out of their own volition.\nCritics of the voluntary market point out that this does not lower the overall amount of greenhouse gases released by buyers. They are simply offset, which gives corporations a way to claim they are eco-friendly without reducing their overall emissions. Critics call this \"greenwashing.\" \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RPP9WU3wamPURU2bx7t7l.png?height=495&width=853)\n\nThe voluntary carbon market is a market in which participants can buy and sell credits to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. The voluntary carbon market operates largely unchecked by federal or local regulators. This has led to concerns about the quality of the credits being sold. Verra, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group founded by environmental and business leaders to improve quality assurance in voluntary carbon markets, has set the most widely used standard to validate those credits called the Verified Carbon Standard.. \n \n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is not the lead agency when it comes to regulating carbon credits, but they have been involved in many different ways. For example, the USDA has helped fund carbon capturing projects and published data to help agricultural businesses capitalize on this growing market. In addition, the USDA is part of a proposed climate partnership initiative that would fund conservation projects on working land and quantify the carbon and sustainability benefits that come as a result of those projects. This would be an important step in helping agriculture reduce its overall greenhouse gas emissions footprint. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vj3JsY_--frbjv7Emw8e2.png?height=490&width=865)\n\nAre states creating any kind of market for carbon trading?\n\nYes, California is the only state with a state cap-and-trade market. By 2030, the state aims to lower emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels. About 450 entities targeted by the market must deliver an overall 15 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the \"business-as-usual\" scenario in 2020.", "timestamp": 1656080553, "digest": "G8zSfEpYEygSN27EWeKbmF45JqCFMw0IiJQh7ryHAPg", "contributor": "0x8D0f4124E67f32D4211045a15242EC8B11daB6c2"}

I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). In his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. If information is allowed to propagate, then it will find its way into every nook and cranny. Sometimes, this can be useful to society. This can be for better or worse, but cryptography is a tool that allows us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA cryptographic protocol tends to have three goals:\n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, most of the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum only focuses on integrity and authentication goals. It forms the backbone of decentralization as it allows anyone to verify:\n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nWe call this property *public verifiability* as anyone can fetch the public data and check if the computation for it was performed correctly. As you can imagine, this is crucial to protect coins held by users on the network and to protect the integrity of smart contracts. Because all the data is publicly available, it also implies the running default is a lack of financial privacy.\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\n**Not an anonymous currency.** Many people find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange at first. I suspect this is the case because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use in the dark web. The very name *crypto*currency leads to that misunderstanding. Unfortunately for criminals, they are the most traceable currencies in the world and it is a really bad tool for their desired purpose. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose.\n\n**Privacy-coins do exist.** Confidentiality of financial transactions on a global scale is a sought-after feature. A number of systems exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. is a sought-after property and there are a number of systems with strong confidentiality including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. I believe this frontier of research and development is essential for the continued growth of decentralised finance (DeFi).\n\nA fun project is to list the existing DeFI applications and identify which aspects can benefit from financial privacy. But for now, we do not concern ourselves with confidentiality. It is not needed to understand how cryptography is immediately used in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThe cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is basic. There are only two primitives to consider. A commitment scheme to protect the integrity of the blockchain and digital signatures to authenticate actions from an end-user. We have put together dedicated articles for both primitives and in this article we provide a brief explanation of each.\n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature. A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity. They can compute the credentials (public-private key pair) locally on their machine. The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer. A signature is timeless and it can be verified at any point in time. In fact, we can check all historical transactions in a network like Bitcoin and verify the signer was indeed authorised to spend the coins.\n\nWhat about zero knowledge proofs?", "timestamp": 1656080688, "digest": "a4Y0TrLL7BcS8rarDfDVQW6HJKSTydm5K7u2sEqC2wA", "contributor": "0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5"}
{"id": "-FgAUwNGxd9FfRty2qHQ67erplMstGtpon0JkgW-r9g", "title": "The Future of Actively Managed On-Chain Asset Protocols: Unlock the Hidden Socialfi Property of Enzyme", "body": "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*CIAkUuBbPEx6Vn67)\n\n***By Kyle, Investment Manager@Bing Ventures***\n\nLike Stablecoin, on-chain asset management has been one of the first blockchain scenarios to land. The DAO’s organizational structure naturally removes organizational barriers to decentralized asset management. Enzyme, a pioneer of multi-chain asset management protocols, was created in 2016. More importantly, it can use tokens to incentivise asset issuers and liquidity participants to tap into more decentralized financial scenarios.\n\nFrom flatter investment decision-making systems, to incentives to participate in product beta versions, to the formation of vast armies of capital in the upcoming metaverse. These new tools will be a force to be reckoned with once the asset management protocol has achieved the integration of tokens with the community.\n\nEnzyme allows users to make speculative bets using liquid assets. With the development of decentralized asset management protocols and the emergence of new ways to interact with the “X-to-earn” social paradigm beyond DeFi boundaries, we can expect to see an influx of user demand for such tokens.\n\nNew players are entering the new management game.\n\n## Decentralized asset management: an attempt to return to classical equilibrium\n\nDue to the nature of centralization and barriers, traditional asset management is a high-cost and high-friction industry. The core of decentralized asset management is to optimize the traditional asset management process.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*j8yfKo1c9dmnsVoV)\n\n*source: coingecko*\n\n### 1/ 9 advantages of decentralized asset management\n\nDecentralized asset management utilizing blockchain and smart contract technology has the following advantages:\n\n\\*\\*1. Effectively reducing start-up costs. \\*\\*This is arguably the most important and immediate improvement. In traditional finance, creating a fund requires high compliance, registration and notarization fees. But the cost of starting a fund on a blockchain is low.\n\n\\*\\*2. Greatly shorten the startup time. \\*\\*The traditional fund creation process can take months. The decentralized alternative only takes a few minutes.\n\n\\*\\*3.Anyone can be a fund manager. \\*\\*Blockchains and smart contracts allow anyone with a computer to build their own investment vehicles.\n\n\\*\\*4.Anyone can be a fund investor. \\*\\*Top fund investment opportunities are limited to qualified investors with net assets of several million dollars, while decentralized asset management does not limit the size of funds.\n\n\\*\\*5. Strictly enforced terms of authorization. \\*\\*Traditional fund rules and licensing agreements are often enforced subjectively by fund managers and can still be broken at their discretion. Blockchain-based funds can make rules strictly algorithmic, leaving fund managers with no choice but to follow predefined rules.\n\n\\*\\*6. Based on the principle of untrusteeship/no trust. \\*\\*In blockchain-based funds, fund managers do not have the right to trust or withdraw investors’ money, but can only use it to execute certain investments.\n\n\\*\\*7. More liquidity. \\*\\*Most traditional fund redemptions are usually quarterly. Blockchain-based funds can greatly increase investor liquidity, and protocols can allow instant redemption depending on the actual state of the fund’s position on the chain.\n\n\\*\\*8. Transparency. \\*\\*Foundations in the traditional asset management world are often closed and relatively opaque because of their reliance on real-life contracts, external auditors and non-real-time reporting. A fund built on blockchain is completely transparent, with all changes in its portfolio updated in real time.\n\n\\*\\*9. Composability. \\*\\*Decentralized finance has evolved into a set of interconnected and modular monetary Legos. This allows decentralized asset management to easily plug into other DeFi services for trading, extending leverage, insurance, swaps and other product capabilities. That gives investors more choice\n\n### 2/ The appeal of active on-chain money management\n\nAsset management in DeFi can be divided into the following three categories:\n\n1\\. Active on-chain fund management (active management)\n\n2\\. Index products and basket currencies (passively managed)\n\n3\\. Structured products and vault based products\n\nThis paper deals only with the field of active on-chain fund management. Historically, actively managed funds have generally outperformed passive basket indices, or DPI indices. Actively managed funds tend to do better in downturns. Of course, passive asset management protocols usually have advantages in attracting capital, but in maintaining the efficiency of capital operation, they often encounter the problem of liquidity disloyalty, which can only be overcome by the unsustainable way of high-yield mining.\n\nMotivating teams and users to develop high-yield Alpha strategies is an issue that needs to be considered in every asset management agreement, regardless of type. But with passive asset management protocols, the big returns are often available only to a few. This can lead to a long time gap between protocol product development and capital strategy execution. Active funds, by contrast, can change strategies and compete for capital more quickly because of the large number of managers and often only need to capture high-return speculative assets and trade in secondary markets.\n\nOf course, the discretion of asset management protocols is also a double-edged sword. High yields may be a moat for passive management protocols, but robustness and diversification are preferred for active management protocols. Ongoing policy maintenance and optimization is a good starting point for socializing. Recent large-scale DeFi liquidations have proven that agreements that are divorced from communities and violate the principle of decentralization cannot ensure capital efficiency.\n\n## A difficult attempt to socialize asset management\n\n### 1/Cater to the personalized needs of crypto users\n\nOn-chain asset management ensures that investors have no trust in the custody of capital. Transparent ledgers reduce the cost burden of complex accounting and auditing. At the same time, DeFi’s permitless access provides users with open access rights. This means that the cost of launching a hedge fund in the blockchain world is limited to a small amount of Gas fees.\n\nHowever, the TVL of decentralized asset management protocols is small. Why hasn’t something with such high product fit expanded rapidly so far? The main thing is that the space is still getting more social traction. While this segment of the market may be immature relative to other DeFi products, its acceptance so far has been very encouraging.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*wZZaZxYBHowzDo5n)\n\n*source: Enzyme*\n\nCryptographic native protocols are building a toolkit for decentralized money management in a variety of ways. We may see crypto-native asset management protocols become popular before more mainstream traditional institutions take action. Social tokens allow users to make interesting trades on speculative assets. These on-chain assets are traded based on individual needs in a decentralized asset management approach.\n\nWeb3.0 and crypto native tokens may not simply be a one-to-one copy of TradFi onto the blockchain. While cost reduction is important, it is mechanism design and the development of unique products based on smart contracts that are likely to attract users. Unfortunately, innovative decentralized asset management infrastructures often have little to offer in terms of innovative mechanisms.\n\n### 2/ Why hasn’t there been a pandemic?\n\nThe asset management habits of crypto users are often fast-paced, which conflicts with the long-cycle nature of asset management. A step-by-step strategy is clearly unacceptable to users in an area characterized by the highest volatility. So highly leveraged crypto derivatives tend to be more popular. How the asset management protocol provides these policies and scenarios to users with low risk is very important. Note that I said low-risk offering, not low-risk creating profit.\n\nFor actively managed funds, it takes years of continuous management to have a chance of producing long-term average returns. For fund managers, the process is also relatively long. The cost of trust is higher than the copy trading function of a centralized exchange. So how asset management protocols ensure that users build trust in the face of these long turnaround periods is also important. So far, vault design and community fund rewards are viable mechanisms.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*sdqKbNItcSFVsGyR)\n\n*source: Token Terminal*\n\nIn addition, DeFi users tend to prefer the feeling of being in control of their money, and some good fund managers may not necessarily like full exposure to the chain portfolio. This prevents the agreement from attracting higher-quality fund managers and a larger number of DeFi users.\n\nHow to bridge the boundaries between privacy and initiative is important. Instant redemption, users’ rights to portfolio assets and the empowerment of managers’ equity are also important. From this point of view, investment kols with their own community attributes tend to be the priority of decentralized asset management protocols, while social tokens and NFT have obvious advantages in increasing tool availability and user asset flow.\n\n## Enzyme: Eliminate capital waste and welcome social return\n\n### 1/Integrate protocols and portfolio assets to improve capital efficiency\n\nEnzyme is a modification of Melon Protocol. They released version V4 this year, which has a lot of innovation beyond basic features like decentralized lending, AMM pools, and agricultural capabilities. Fund managers have access to a large number of functions outside the protocol. This protocol integrates Polygon, Uniswap V3, Opyn, Compound, Aave and other protocols.\n\nAt the same time, Gas Relayer’s new features allow asset managers to eliminate the high ethereum Gas fee burden and redefine the cost of the entire vault. To fully understand how this works, as well as its implications and best practices, we will soon be Posting a blog covering this.\n\nV4 allows users to customize the token/ticker symbol and customize around the user’s brand identity. Users can also transfer shares to new investors without redemption. This creates a secondary market for the user’s Treasury stock, which gives it the opportunity to trade. Users can invest in more than 200 assets here. The platform also enables organizations to run their own investment funds using Gnosis multi-signature wallets.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*MlO7nAiNukplj6sA)\n\n*source: Enzyme*\n\nEnzyme solves the problem of capital inefficiencies by integrating deployment with multiple protocols. Increase the availability of the agreement by borrowing and escrow assets. So Enzyme is definitely on the move when it comes to making broader gains. The allocation and use of idle assets to obtain immediate income increases the source of liquidity and income options. Better use of idle assets and LP tokens is an important reason why Enzyme is ahead.\n\n### 2/The key to winning: Personalized social investing trends\n\nEnzyme’s own Treasury creates a personalized vault, while users can easily copy on-chain policies. These designs greatly enhance users’ social security and freedom. Enzyme also improves security and depositor protection through a 7-day review period.\n\nV4 introduced a protocol fee for this protocol. The fee is a tax on the amount of assets under management in each vault. This is calculated continuously with respect to the annualized target percentage and results in the automatic casting of a certain number of additional shares for each vault and allocation to the agreement itself. The agreement uses a repo mechanism to force fund managers to demand MLN tokens. In addition, the burning of the MLN used for buybacks creates deflationary pressures on tokens.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*H6fCbtAAozyf-AQX)\n\n*source: DefiLlama*\n\nIn traditional finance, investing in hedge funds can be difficult for the average person. Launching hedge funds could be harder. Enzyme simplified and innovated the fund launch process, and the openness of the network they built in addition to improving transparency, democratized access for all investors. After years of development, Enzyme’s TVL hovers around $30 million.\n\nWe think Enzyme should pursue more social attempts to monetize smart elitist investment management. For investors, Enzyme lowers barriers to entry and improves transparency. As long as the Enzyme protocol continues to integrate and expand the scope of assets and focus on optimizing the long-term direction of composable financial instruments, the investability of assets across the chain will continue to increase.\n\nEven during bear markets, asset management protocols should consider a profit strategy on the downside. Fund managers can hold stablecoin assets and avoid the downward trend in profits. On this basis, how to create more investment options for users in a falling market is the problem to consider. For the two core stakeholders, it is only a matter of time before AUM rises in the future, as long as their enthusiasm can be stimulated.", "timestamp": 1656080693, "digest": "2a0GYBhiBG9Wp85mV0UVSxBJ9OZwaFDa5vvOopTZe04", "contributor": "0x867A3f354c0eCB6622aEf1bF14C3BE79338AD889"}

I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). In his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. The idea that information wants to find its way into every nook and cranny can be for the better or worse. For example, information leaks can help us learn about help us learn about atrocities committed by government, but it can also be used by the government for surveillance of its citizens. \n\nGenerally, cryptography is a tool that helps us bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. If we consider the ability to transmit secret messages from the perspective of David vs Goliath, then cryptography is one of the only tools that allows a citizen to successfully fend against a nation state actor. For most of its history, cryptography is a tool that allows an entity to defend itself against all-powerful adversary. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA cryptographic protocol tends to have three goals:\n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, most of the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum only focuses on integrity and authentication goals. It forms the backbone of decentralization as it allows anyone to verify:\n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nWe call this property *public verifiability* as anyone can fetch the public data and check if the computation for it was performed correctly. As you can imagine, this is crucial to protect coins held by users on the network and to protect the integrity of smart contracts. Because all the data is publicly available, it also implies the running default is a lack of financial privacy.\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\n**Not an anonymous currency.** Many people find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange at first. I suspect this is the case because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use in the dark web. The very name *crypto*currency leads to that misunderstanding. Unfortunately for criminals, they are the most traceable currencies in the world and it is a really bad tool for their desired purpose. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose.\n\n**Privacy-coins do exist.** Confidentiality of financial transactions on a global scale is a sought-after feature. A number of systems exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. is a sought-after property and there are a number of systems with strong confidentiality including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. I believe this frontier of research and development is essential for the continued growth of decentralised finance (DeFi).\n\nA fun project is to list the existing DeFI applications and identify which aspects can benefit from financial privacy. But for now, we do not concern ourselves with confidentiality. It is not needed to understand how cryptography is immediately used in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThe cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is basic. There are only two primitives to consider. A commitment scheme to protect the integrity of the blockchain and digital signatures to authenticate actions from an end-user. We have put together dedicated articles for both primitives and in this article we provide a brief explanation of each.\n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature. A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity. They can compute the credentials (public-private key pair) locally on their machine. The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer. A signature is timeless and it can be verified at any point in time. In fact, we can check all historical transactions in a network like Bitcoin and verify the signer was indeed authorised to spend the coins.\n\nWhat about zero knowledge proofs?", "timestamp": 1656081584, "digest": "a4Y0TrLL7BcS8rarDfDVQW6HJKSTydm5K7u2sEqC2wA", "contributor": "0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5"}

It details the story of the Corleone family, focusing on the patriarch Vito Corleone and his son Michael. The novel covers the years 1945 to 1955, and also includes flashbacks to events that occurred in 1902.\n\nThe book has been translated into over 20 languages and sold over 26 million copies worldwide. In 1972 it was adapted into a film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, which won three Academy Awards including Best Picture. The sequel, The Godfather: Part II was released in 1974 and received five Oscar nominations including Best Picture. A third movie based on Puzo's original screenplay but not directed by Coppola—The Godfather: Part III—was released in 1990 after Puzo's death; it received mixed reviews but was successful commercially nonetheless.\n\nPuzo wrote The Godfather as an attempt to \"capture...the strength of the American family unit.\" He wanted to show how \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\" while also exploring themes such as trustworthiness, betrayal, love and hate. Critics have praised Puzo's skillful characterization and plotting; many consider TheGodfather one of the greatest novels ever written about organized crime or America itself.", "timestamp": 1656081507, "digest": "7iub2av41mL2XYFveELJITtMV7igp5anRn2uqhzP3hM", "contributor": "0x230Fc4cdF11bdf8B0FBe6F43b154d19458c74D4c"}
