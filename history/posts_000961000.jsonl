Crypto enthusiasts say their vision for the web would decentralize it, pushing it closer to its roots.\n\nWeb3 advocates emphasize user privacy and ownership of data.\n\nCentralization has helped onboard billions of people to the World Wide Web and created the stable, robust infrastructure on which it lives. At the same time, a handful of centralized entities have a stronghold on large swathes of the World Wide Web, unilaterally deciding what should and should not be allowed.\n\nWeb3 is the answer to this dilemma. Instead of a Web monopolized by large technology companies, Web3 embraces decentralization and is being built, operated, and owned by its users.

If someone wants to watch a movie, they can go to Netflix and watch a movie in a matter of seconds. If someone wants to hear their favorite song, all they have to do is have an Apple Music account and they can stream all of the music they want. If someone wants to send money to their friend, they can use Cashapp, or use a multitude of apps to send crypto in a near instant fashion. With the ability to do a multitude of things instantly, why can’t people be paid their salary or wages in the manner that they chose? With blockchain technology, payment streaming is becoming possible.\n\nPayment streaming allows employees to receive real-time wages. For example, if someone wants to be paid daily, they can receive the payment the same day after labor has been performed. Contrast that to today’s payment system. Employees have to work two weeks and then the following week, they are paid. Now, this system is what many employees in the United States are accustomed to so there hasn’t been any disruption. To go into further detail regarding how the system works, the employers owe the employees for their time. Theoretically, the employers are in debt to the employees but the debt carries no interest, is not mutual, and is one-sided in favor of the employers. ** \n **\n\nContrasting the traditional system to streaming payments, the latter is easier for entities sending payments as there only needs to be a series of set parameters embedded in a smart contract. To give context on how this could work, tokens can be sent from employers to employees on a continuous basis depending on the rate of payment flow. For example, if someone is to be paid 1000 dollars a month, they could receive payments of 1 dollar and 39 cents an hour or 23 cents per minute. This flexibility allows for people to be paid on their desired time horizon such as hourly, daily, or weekly. \n\nAdditionally, with the advent of crypto streaming, employers can pay their employees by paying them in the token of the receiver’s choice. Imagine if employers were able to invest in their employees by paying them in whatever tokens they please. Although, at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency industry has taken a massive hit, getting paid in certain crypto assets can be deemed as a way to encourage wealth building.\n\nAnother point about the benefits of payment streaming is the reduced reliability of financial institutions. Financial institutions charge many types of fees, exchange rates, commissions and other charges that inconvenience their account holders. Additionally, financial institutions can control when the received funds are available for an account holder’s use which is yet another inconvenience caused by the traditional financial system. \n\nInconveniences caused by not streaming payments pose real-world consequences for people. Many people suffer from not budgeting properly and sometimes “life happens”, which causes a need for instant availability of funds. Currently, people who are faced with a challenging system are forced to go into debt by using credit cards or by dealing with an undesirable situation. Imagine if someone had a car issue that prevented them from driving. If this person doesn’t have the necessary funds to get their car serviced, they will have to deal with the inconveniences of finding another means of traveling until they have access to more funds in the next pay period. However, if these individuals were able to stream their funds, they could pay to service their car once they accumulated enough money. \n\nCurrently, there are few projects looking to develop ways to drive the possibility of payment streaming. These projects include [Superfluid](https://twitter.com/superfluid_hq?s=21&t=TQ0hhKE3YVhqgYWodV8ytw), [Streamflow](https://twitter.com/streamflow_fi?s=21&t=TQ0hhKE3YVhqgYWodV8ytw), and [Roketo](https://twitter.com/roketostream?s=21&t=BmFd1mwTgP2PbnEkssusaw). While this article has focused on primarily payment streaming for wages, these vendors offer a wide variety of use cases leveraging the principles of streaming payments. \n\nSuperfluid is a startup founded in 2020 by [Francesco George Renzi](https://twitter.com/francescorenzia?s=21&t=dKh-A-ylpVemIi0IgKrrEQ), Miao Miao, and [Michele D’Aliessi](https://twitter.com/micheledaliessi?s=21&t=iUfVqmNKEWz9jvhFd6JadA). In July of 2021, the team scored an investment of 9 million dollars from firms including [Multicoin Capital](https://twitter.com/multicoincap?lang=en), [DeFinance Capital](https://twitter.com/defiancecapital?lang=en), [Delphi Ventures](https://twitter.com/delphi_digital?s=21&t=RlA3a4zRKneEclyUUyDPZQ), [Semantic Ventures](https://twitter.com/semanticvc). The round also included angel investors such as [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis?s=21&t=RlA3a4zRKneEclyUUyDPZQ), [Stani Kulechov](https://twitter.com/stanikulechov?s=21&t=RlA3a4zRKneEclyUUyDPZQ), [Ryan Selkis](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot), and [David Hoffman](https://twitter.com/trustlessstate?s=21&t=Tie5dI57iuQ7NR7Tl-z1Xg). The project has also received support from DAOs such as [Metacartel Ventures](https://twitter.com/venture_dao?s=21&t=bQzg6TxN1CjM5PYGMiFz3g), [The LAO](https://twitter.com/thelaoofficial), and [Alliance DAO](https://twitter.com/alliancedao?s=21&t=Bm0D9ECQAH4n1zJIz23Viw). Superfluid facilitates streams on the Ethereum blockchain through its smart contract framework that allows users to transfer tokens or other digital assets on chain with a set of predefined rules called agreements. Currently, the project’s capabilities include payment streaming with gas less transfers, with real-time liquidity which allows its users to only require enough balance to keep their payment streams open. Furthermore, users do not incur a delay when withdrawing their funds. \n\nStreamflow is a startup founded in 2021 whose team includes [@imprfekt](https://twitter.com/imprfekt?s=21&t=HKaDWqeT71m1QOpdwiAzRA) and others. The platform is built on Solana and its current capabilities include streaming payments and token vesting with more options coming in the future such as a multisig wallet. In the future, Streamflow aims to expand cross-chain and onboard web2 projects onto the platform. Streamflow’s most recent round of funding was a 3.1 million dollar seed round with backers that include [Jump Crypto](https://mobile.twitter.com/jumpcryptohq), [Solana Ventures](https://twitter.com/solanaventures?lang=en), [GBV Capital](https://twitter.com/gbvofficial?lang=en), [AngelDAO](https://twitter.com/angeldaoorg), [Huobi Ventures](https://twitter.com/huobiventures?lang=en) and others. \n\nRoketo is another payment streaming platform built on the [NEAR protocol](https://twitter.com/nearprotocol?s=21&t=fbOfQH-ItSYRNF5qCpw58A) whose primary contributors come from Kikimora Labs. The core team includes [Taras Dovgal](https://twitter.com/tarasdovgal?s=21&t=M1qUr1bj0nbhFOfasGFgOw), [Olga Isaeva](https://twitter.com/olyflow?s=21&t=uhmNY24CggKkW3dNGRZqwg), [Vasilisa Versus](https://twitter.com/dcversus?s=21&t=TtmvHOfggCCZbllIIAOFsA), and over 20 others. Roketo is backed by [MetaWeb Ventures](https://mobile.twitter.com/metawebvc), [A&T Capital](https://twitter.com/ant_capital?s=21&t=vVrsk_8dA4U-LLSX4Qn4tQ),[Cogitent Ventures](https://twitter.com/cogitentv?s=21&t=zC-QgTxzxYj9dwbA31ldLQ), and [Move Capital](https://twitter.com/movecap?s=21&t=bbOzlhC0d07uGAI3Jwpacw). The company’s current capabilities include payroll, vesting, and airdropping. Regarding payroll, Rocket serves its customers by providing a quick solution to setting up wages for employees with transparency and low cost. Roketo advertises its ability to the preceding functions while also ensuring its customers have total control over their crypto currency. With regards to vesting, Roketo’s vesting product aids founders with streaming tokens to their investors as well as their employees. Within Roketo’s product, users can set cliffs for token distribution and keep distribution consistent. Lastly, for Rocketo’s airdrop offering, Roketo touts itself as the most affordable and intuitive product on the market. \n\nWith the aforementioned startups and most likely others who are focused on creating products to help users stream funds, one can imagine that there are implications of the success of this innovation. Payment streaming will provide more flexibility and create more control for people to have over their finances. This control can provide a way for people to determine the financial outcomes and create a way to adapt to life’s financial challenges easier. As mentioned before, these circumstances could allow users to have access to funds which could limit their reliance on credit, ultimately reducing debt. There are a multitude of use cases that payment streaming can benefit such as “subscription” models such as rent. Streaming payments benefit both parties of transactions as the requesting entity can trust that they will receive the payment continuously as opposed to in one lump sum payment. Ultimately, as this technology is adopted, it will be exciting to see how payment streaming will create a more fair, convenient, and mutually beneficial financial system.\n\n***If you LOVE this article, are you against sending a tip to Cryptojeter.eth?

Currently, the project’s capabilities include payment streaming with gas less transfers, with real-time liquidity which allows its users to only require enough balance to keep their payment streams open. Furthermore, users do not incur a delay when withdrawing their funds. \n\nStreamflow is a startup founded in 2021 whose team includes [@imprfekt](https://twitter.com/imprfekt?s=21&t=HKaDWqeT71m1QOpdwiAzRA) and others. The platform is built on Solana and its current capabilities include streaming payments and token vesting with more options coming in the future such as a multisig wallet. In the future, Streamflow aims to expand cross-chain and onboard web2 projects onto the platform. Streamflow’s most recent round of funding was a 3.1 million dollar seed round with backers that include [Jump Crypto](https://mobile.twitter.com/jumpcryptohq), [Solana Ventures](https://twitter.com/solanaventures?lang=en), [GBV Capital](https://twitter.com/gbvofficial?lang=en), [AngelDAO](https://twitter.com/angeldaoorg), [Huobi Ventures](https://twitter.com/huobiventures?lang=en) and others. \n\nRoketo is another payment streaming platform built on the [NEAR protocol](https://twitter.com/nearprotocol?s=21&t=fbOfQH-ItSYRNF5qCpw58A) whose primary contributors come from Kikimora Labs. The core team includes [Taras Dovgal](https://twitter.com/tarasdovgal?s=21&t=M1qUr1bj0nbhFOfasGFgOw), [Olga Isaeva](https://twitter.com/olyflow?s=21&t=uhmNY24CggKkW3dNGRZqwg), [Vasilisa Versus](https://twitter.com/dcversus?s=21&t=TtmvHOfggCCZbllIIAOFsA), and over 20 others. Roketo is backed by [MetaWeb Ventures](https://mobile.twitter.com/metawebvc), [A&T Capital](https://twitter.com/ant_capital?s=21&t=vVrsk_8dA4U-LLSX4Qn4tQ),[Cogitent Ventures](https://twitter.com/cogitentv?s=21&t=zC-QgTxzxYj9dwbA31ldLQ), and [Move Capital](https://twitter.com/movecap?s=21&t=bbOzlhC0d07uGAI3Jwpacw). The company’s current capabilities include payroll, vesting, and airdropping. Regarding payroll, Rocket serves its customers by providing a quick solution to setting up wages for employees with transparency and low cost. Roketo advertises its ability to the preceding functions while also ensuring its customers have total control over their crypto currency. With regards to vesting, Roketo’s vesting product aids founders with streaming tokens to their investors as well as their employees. Within Roketo’s product, users can set cliffs for token distribution and keep distribution consistent. Lastly, for Rocketo’s airdrop offering, Roketo touts itself as the most affordable and intuitive product on the market. \n\nWith the aforementioned startups and most likely others who are focused on creating products to help users stream funds, one can imagine that there are implications of the success of this innovation. Payment streaming will provide more flexibility and create more control for people to have over their finances. This control can provide a way for people to determine the financial outcomes and create a way to adapt to life’s financial challenges easier. As mentioned before, these circumstances could allow users to have access to funds which could limit their reliance on credit, ultimately reducing debt. There are a multitude of use cases that payment streaming can benefit such as “subscription” models such as rent. Streaming payments benefit both parties of transactions as the requesting entity can trust that they will receive the payment continuously as opposed to in one lump sum payment. Ultimately, as this technology is adopted, it will be exciting to see how payment streaming will create a more fair, convenient, and mutually beneficial financial system.\n\n***If you LOVE this article, are you against sending a tip to Cryptojeter.eth?

"目前市面上加密货币钱包的种类繁多，但大多数钱包的使用技巧和操作你都真正的了解和掌握吗？而且我们能通过钱包这个便利窗口进入到一个庞大繁华的区块链世界，钱包不仅仅是一个转移存取代币的工具，而且它有非常多的其他实用功能，我们以下谈论点主要以市面上使用率最高的热门的钱包metamask小狐狸为例展开讲解以及由钱包的使用延伸到区块链浏览器的使用\n\n**1，语言的选择**\n\n小狐狸钱包是目前使用最为广泛的数字货币钱包，小狐狸钱包有两种版本的下载方式，通过电脑端Google商店安装浏览器插件版本和手机下载APP版本，两种版本的使用功能差不多，首先下载好钱包后，为了便于个人的使用习惯选择适合自己的的语言系统，我们可以通过如下操作完成语言设置\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F_GT72eAfyQI8zEPyF2wKg.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**2，助记词**\n\n通过设置中点击安全与隐私找到钱包的助记词，助记词和私匙是钱包最为重要的密码，掌握其中任一种即可在不需要密码的情况下开启钱包，并且这两样东西若是丢失，钱包中功能不会有任何备份，所以一定要保存好这两样东西\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FFYXkCktfXpesL2CCKVz8f.png\\&w=1920\\&q=90)\n\n**3，钱包网络状态**\n\n有一点需要注意，有的人在添加测试网络时，出现无法添加的情况，一般是因为关闭了钱包的测试网络添加按钮，通过设置按钮点开启动即可\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fwn2ClY1D7zVHcGWEbLXxo.png\\&w=1920\\&q=90)\n\n**4，钱包常规功能**\n\n我们能轻松便捷的通过小狐狸钱包内置功能完成转账，收款，购买，和兑换等功能，你需要知道在完成购买或者兑换时会收取大概1%的手续费（通过兑换功能兑换代币也会有代币的损失我们通常称之为无偿损失，这也无法避免。）\n\n**但我们可以通过点击“高级选项”调节兑换“滑点”来减少损失（在允许的范围内调节滑点大小），滑点百分比调节越小，兑换成功率会受到影响，所以通常选择一个合适的范围调节点1%—3%之间，滑点百分比越高成功的几率越高，但损失也会越大**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F6TZ3sLZT2qykfgYmYd6ih.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n通过第3步的方式可以查看我们过往交互链接过的项目，如果曾经链接过的项目忘记了可以通过这种方式找到，也能通过这种方式掐断钱包和项目的默认链接状态或者点击4步直接断开与该项目的链接状态\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fu9nQLZRsuhbDjdy7ho\\_7H.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**5，交互卡链情况的处理**\n\n对于链上交互遇到比较拥堵的时候，严重的情况下一笔交易可能会卡住一两天，这种情况下我们应该怎么去处理掉这笔卡链交易（如果这种严重拥堵状况再次加手续费都无法完成），通常我们可以通过两种方式解决：\n\n第一种比较直接的方式挤掉所有前面未完成的交易，直接再次通过其他方式交互完成下一笔交易，在交易的时候，通过设置实时汽油费（这时设置GAS汽油费就应该根据当时情况设置更高数值才能顺利完成）\n\n第二种方式是点开钱包的设置找到“高级”选项功能启用自定义交易\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fy1VMd_ow3GZrLwMmMgQzU.png\\&w=1920\\&q=90)\n\n点击钱包的“活动”按钮找到最近的的一笔卡链未完成的交易找到nonce比如我这个是“132”记下这个数字，那么要挤掉这个未完成的交易，再下一次的交易中自定义就填写133，就会顺利过渡到下一笔交易\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F-iqEAgZvs6c6I2qHZQ3kj.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n小狐狸钱包它本身自带的链网络不多，我们可以通过如下网站自动添加所需要的各种网络，非常方便\n\n**二，区块浏览器的使用**\n\n通过钱包完成的链上交易我们可以通过钱包窗口进入到区块浏览器查看，区块浏览器会显示出此钱包所有在链上的活动痕迹，无处遁形，这也恰恰展示了区块链去中心化的魅力所在，学会使用它你可以查到任意钱包地址的持币情况和交易细节，更有助于了解区块链项目的背后的代币运行逻辑通过点击1，2步进入区块浏览器\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F9cnF0MsL_j8znMR35vit5.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**1，重要数据检索**\n\n在区块浏览器中我们能查看很多重要的数据信息，比如某个钱包地址状态是在卖出还是买入代币，代币时间线，代币来源，去往和获取方式等\n\n每个代币都有一个合约地址，我们可以像查询钱包地址一样，在检索栏输入这个合约地址这个合约地址所代表的代币信息都会被检索出来\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FKb9vHfsJvB8y7Wze-ytAb.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n在1中输入（上图所示）某个代币的名称，合约地址，以及哈希数能看到这个输入代号的所有链上情况\n\n在2中点开下拉键，能看到所有此钱包的代币，如果钱包中没有显示拥有的代币，可以通过这种方式获取代币合约添加到钱包中，比如我们要添加USDC代币到钱包，通过进入区块链浏览器，点击1，找到2中的的USDC，点开\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FctQkC6JiCySyg_GFO9YXO.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n就可以看到右边红框中的一串数字字母混合就是USDC的合约地址，复制合约地址，回到钱包下拉找到导入代币按钮，输入合约地址就可以成功添加代币名称到钱包\n\n**2，代币各种数据的位置**\n\n通过检索USDC代币，我们能看到USDC在链上的所有信息，这个地址钱包里代币的种类、代币名称、代币总供应量、总的持币地址数、价格、24小时涨跌幅度，当时市值，在偏右边的这个信息中可以看到USDC的合约地址、精度、官方网站、社交媒体链接等\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FefqBCgpmM8Eeg9YlMCKjq.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**3，“Transaction”及其他**\n\n在3中我们通过“[Transactions](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd58af9f90ebb67d4400a1268fae5fbcadab44777#transactions)”列查看这个钱包所有的代币活动行为：包括时间线，通过什么方式获得的代币（转账，swap，claim等等）代币时间线，代币来源，去往等\n\n交易的哈希值、区块高度、交易时间、被调用的合约地址、交易的以太币数量、交易耗费的Gas以及后面分类的代币列表：ERC-20(代币）,ERC-721（NFT）,ERC-1155(NFT)\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F-AwoWphsELMkKp2JRUkrS.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**4，持币地址的分布**\n\n在页面下半部分，有一个非常重要信息：持币地址的分布\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fhn5VdCD9cRdjVBKtnzudd.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n在上图的界面里，持有USDC代币的地址由多到少依次排列，包括持币者的排名、地址、持币数量，以及占总供应量的百分比和对应的美元计价市值。\n\n这个界面可以探寻到非常多的重要信息。比如哪些著名地址持有了USDC；USDC的大户之间有没有代币转移，甚至抛售出货等等\n\n某个币种价格的波动，往往都会包含在这些消息中。当你决定进行某个项目的代币买卖时，这些信息显得非常重要，往往可以看清项目方背后言语的真实发展路径和用意。\n\n区块浏览器蕴含一个发币项目很多重要数据，由于篇幅原因没有做过多深入讲解，希望能给带给大家一些对区块浏览器使用的启发性思维。\n\n![本文作者：SnapFingersDAO内容部--@maik2hello](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F_R5mgmAZg3aEcVJkLSYl0.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n本文作者：SnapFingersDAO内容部--\\@maik2hello\n\n**SnapFingersDAO响指精选知识库：**\n\n**掌握更多币圈价值信息关注推特：**\n",

The global market for carbon credits is expected to be worth $1 billion by 2021, and the industry has already seen record highs in both volume and value.\n\nCarbon credits are financial products that represent 1 ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere. They can be purchased by individuals or companies in order to offset emissions from things like industrial production, delivery vehicles, or travel. The most common way of creating carbon credits is through agricultural or forestry practices, but nearly any project that reduces emissions can generate them.\n\nThe growth of the carbon credit market reflects a growing awareness of climate change and its effects on our planet. Governments are increasingly putting pressure on businesses to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and many large companies see buying carbon credits as an efficient way to meet those targets.\n\nWhat is the compliance market for carbon credits? A carbon credit is a certificate or permit representing the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Governments set a cap on how many tons of emissions certain sectors can release, and this is known as a cap-and-trade market. The cap represents the amount of greenhouse gases a government will allow to be released into the atmosphere, and emitters must trade to stay within that limit. So far, about 64 carbon compliance markets are now in operation around the world. The compliance market for carbon credits has been growing rapidly in recent years as countries have looked for ways to reduce their emissions and meet their climate change goals. In order to participate in these markets, companies must first become certified by an accredited body such as The Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) or The Gold Standard Foundation (GSF). Certification involves verifying that projects reduce emissions by an amount equal to or greater than what they claim on their application. Once certified, companies can sell their credits through online exchanges or directly to buyers such as governments or other businesses looking for ways to comply with emission caps set by regulators.\n\nThe carbon credit market is growing rapidly as companies and countries seek to reduce their emissions. The European compliance market projects that carbon prices will increase 88 percent by 2030, while the voluntary market is experiencing rapid growth. This growth is being driven by corporate net-zero goals and interest in meeting international climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement. \n \n\nVoluntary emissions reductions are those that companies make to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. This can be done through a number of methods, including investing in renewable energy or carbon credits. Voluntary reductions are not mandatory, meaning companies are not required to participate. Instead, they choose to do so out of their own volition.\nCritics of the voluntary market point out that this does not lower the overall amount of greenhouse gases released by buyers. They are simply offset, which gives corporations a way to claim they are eco-friendly without reducing their overall emissions. Critics call this \"greenwashing.\" \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RPP9WU3wamPURU2bx7t7l.png?height=495&width=853)\n\nThe voluntary carbon market is a market in which participants can buy and sell credits to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. The voluntary carbon market operates largely unchecked by federal or local regulators. This has led to concerns about the quality of the credits being sold. Verra, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group founded by environmental and business leaders to improve quality assurance in voluntary carbon markets, has set the most widely used standard to validate those credits called the Verified Carbon Standard.. \n \n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is not the lead agency when it comes to regulating carbon credits, but they have been involved in many different ways. For example, the USDA has helped fund carbon capturing projects and published data to help agricultural businesses capitalize on this growing market. In addition, the USDA is part of a proposed climate partnership initiative that would fund conservation projects on working land and quantify the carbon and sustainability benefits that come as a result of those projects. This would be an important step in helping agriculture reduce its overall greenhouse gas emissions footprint. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vj3JsY_--frbjv7Emw8e2.png?height=490&width=865)\n\nAre states creating any kind of market for carbon trading?\n\nYes, California is the only state with a state cap-and-trade market. By 2030, the state aims to lower emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels. About 450 entities targeted by the market must deliver an overall 15 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the \"business-as-usual\" scenario in 2020.", "timestamp": 1656080553, "digest": "G8zSfEpYEygSN27EWeKbmF45JqCFMw0IiJQh7ryHAPg", "contributor": "0x8D0f4124E67f32D4211045a15242EC8B11daB6c2"}

I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). In his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. If information is allowed to propagate, then it will find its way into every nook and cranny. Sometimes, this can be useful to society. This can be for better or worse, but cryptography is a tool that allows us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA cryptographic protocol tends to have three goals:\n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, most of the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum only focuses on integrity and authentication goals. It forms the backbone of decentralization as it allows anyone to verify:\n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nWe call this property *public verifiability* as anyone can fetch the public data and check if the computation for it was performed correctly. As you can imagine, this is crucial to protect coins held by users on the network and to protect the integrity of smart contracts. Because all the data is publicly available, it also implies the running default is a lack of financial privacy.\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\n**Not an anonymous currency.** Many people find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange at first. I suspect this is the case because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use in the dark web. The very name *crypto*currency leads to that misunderstanding. Unfortunately for criminals, they are the most traceable currencies in the world and it is a really bad tool for their desired purpose. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose.\n\n**Privacy-coins do exist.** Confidentiality of financial transactions on a global scale is a sought-after feature. A number of systems exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. is a sought-after property and there are a number of systems with strong confidentiality including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. I believe this frontier of research and development is essential for the continued growth of decentralised finance (DeFi).\n\nA fun project is to list the existing DeFI applications and identify which aspects can benefit from financial privacy. But for now, we do not concern ourselves with confidentiality. It is not needed to understand how cryptography is immediately used in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThe cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is basic. There are only two primitives to consider. A commitment scheme to protect the integrity of the blockchain and digital signatures to authenticate actions from an end-user. We have put together dedicated articles for both primitives and in this article we provide a brief explanation of each.\n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature. A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity. They can compute the credentials (public-private key pair) locally on their machine. The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer. A signature is timeless and it can be verified at any point in time. In fact, we can check all historical transactions in a network like Bitcoin and verify the signer was indeed authorised to spend the coins.\n\nWhat about zero knowledge proofs?", "timestamp": 1656080688, "digest": "a4Y0TrLL7BcS8rarDfDVQW6HJKSTydm5K7u2sEqC2wA", "contributor": "0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5"}
{"id": "-FgAUwNGxd9FfRty2qHQ67erplMstGtpon0JkgW-r9g", "title": "The Future of Actively Managed On-Chain Asset Protocols: Unlock the Hidden Socialfi Property of Enzyme", "body": "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*CIAkUuBbPEx6Vn67)\n\n***By Kyle, Investment Manager@Bing Ventures***\n\nLike Stablecoin, on-chain asset management has been one of the first blockchain scenarios to land. The DAO’s organizational structure naturally removes organizational barriers to decentralized asset management. Enzyme, a pioneer of multi-chain asset management protocols, was created in 2016. More importantly, it can use tokens to incentivise asset issuers and liquidity participants to tap into more decentralized financial scenarios.\n\nFrom flatter investment decision-making systems, to incentives to participate in product beta versions, to the formation of vast armies of capital in the upcoming metaverse. These new tools will be a force to be reckoned with once the asset management protocol has achieved the integration of tokens with the community.\n\nEnzyme allows users to make speculative bets using liquid assets. With the development of decentralized asset management protocols and the emergence of new ways to interact with the “X-to-earn” social paradigm beyond DeFi boundaries, we can expect to see an influx of user demand for such tokens.\n\nNew players are entering the new management game.\n\n## Decentralized asset management: an attempt to return to classical equilibrium\n\nDue to the nature of centralization and barriers, traditional asset management is a high-cost and high-friction industry. The core of decentralized asset management is to optimize the traditional asset management process.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*j8yfKo1c9dmnsVoV)\n\n*source: coingecko*\n\n### 1/ 9 advantages of decentralized asset management\n\nDecentralized asset management utilizing blockchain and smart contract technology has the following advantages:\n\n\\*\\*1. Effectively reducing start-up costs. \\*\\*This is arguably the most important and immediate improvement. In traditional finance, creating a fund requires high compliance, registration and notarization fees. But the cost of starting a fund on a blockchain is low.\n\n\\*\\*2. Greatly shorten the startup time. \\*\\*The traditional fund creation process can take months. The decentralized alternative only takes a few minutes.\n\n\\*\\*3.Anyone can be a fund manager. \\*\\*Blockchains and smart contracts allow anyone with a computer to build their own investment vehicles.\n\n\\*\\*4.Anyone can be a fund investor. \\*\\*Top fund investment opportunities are limited to qualified investors with net assets of several million dollars, while decentralized asset management does not limit the size of funds.\n\n\\*\\*5. Strictly enforced terms of authorization. \\*\\*Traditional fund rules and licensing agreements are often enforced subjectively by fund managers and can still be broken at their discretion. Blockchain-based funds can make rules strictly algorithmic, leaving fund managers with no choice but to follow predefined rules.\n\n\\*\\*6. Based on the principle of untrusteeship/no trust. \\*\\*In blockchain-based funds, fund managers do not have the right to trust or withdraw investors’ money, but can only use it to execute certain investments.\n\n\\*\\*7. More liquidity. \\*\\*Most traditional fund redemptions are usually quarterly. Blockchain-based funds can greatly increase investor liquidity, and protocols can allow instant redemption depending on the actual state of the fund’s position on the chain.\n\n\\*\\*8. Transparency. \\*\\*Foundations in the traditional asset management world are often closed and relatively opaque because of their reliance on real-life contracts, external auditors and non-real-time reporting. A fund built on blockchain is completely transparent, with all changes in its portfolio updated in real time.\n\n\\*\\*9. Composability. \\*\\*Decentralized finance has evolved into a set of interconnected and modular monetary Legos. This allows decentralized asset management to easily plug into other DeFi services for trading, extending leverage, insurance, swaps and other product capabilities. That gives investors more choice\n\n### 2/ The appeal of active on-chain money management\n\nAsset management in DeFi can be divided into the following three categories:\n\n1\\. Active on-chain fund management (active management)\n\n2\\. Index products and basket currencies (passively managed)\n\n3\\. Structured products and vault based products\n\nThis paper deals only with the field of active on-chain fund management. Historically, actively managed funds have generally outperformed passive basket indices, or DPI indices. Actively managed funds tend to do better in downturns. Of course, passive asset management protocols usually have advantages in attracting capital, but in maintaining the efficiency of capital operation, they often encounter the problem of liquidity disloyalty, which can only be overcome by the unsustainable way of high-yield mining.\n\nMotivating teams and users to develop high-yield Alpha strategies is an issue that needs to be considered in every asset management agreement, regardless of type. But with passive asset management protocols, the big returns are often available only to a few. This can lead to a long time gap between protocol product development and capital strategy execution. Active funds, by contrast, can change strategies and compete for capital more quickly because of the large number of managers and often only need to capture high-return speculative assets and trade in secondary markets.\n\nOf course, the discretion of asset management protocols is also a double-edged sword. High yields may be a moat for passive management protocols, but robustness and diversification are preferred for active management protocols. Ongoing policy maintenance and optimization is a good starting point for socializing. Recent large-scale DeFi liquidations have proven that agreements that are divorced from communities and violate the principle of decentralization cannot ensure capital efficiency.\n\n## A difficult attempt to socialize asset management\n\n### 1/Cater to the personalized needs of crypto users\n\nOn-chain asset management ensures that investors have no trust in the custody of capital. Transparent ledgers reduce the cost burden of complex accounting and auditing. At the same time, DeFi’s permitless access provides users with open access rights. This means that the cost of launching a hedge fund in the blockchain world is limited to a small amount of Gas fees.\n\nHowever, the TVL of decentralized asset management protocols is small. Why hasn’t something with such high product fit expanded rapidly so far? The main thing is that the space is still getting more social traction. While this segment of the market may be immature relative to other DeFi products, its acceptance so far has been very encouraging.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*wZZaZxYBHowzDo5n)\n\n*source: Enzyme*\n\nCryptographic native protocols are building a toolkit for decentralized money management in a variety of ways. We may see crypto-native asset management protocols become popular before more mainstream traditional institutions take action. Social tokens allow users to make interesting trades on speculative assets. These on-chain assets are traded based on individual needs in a decentralized asset management approach.\n\nWeb3.0 and crypto native tokens may not simply be a one-to-one copy of TradFi onto the blockchain. While cost reduction is important, it is mechanism design and the development of unique products based on smart contracts that are likely to attract users. Unfortunately, innovative decentralized asset management infrastructures often have little to offer in terms of innovative mechanisms.\n\n### 2/ Why hasn’t there been a pandemic?\n\nThe asset management habits of crypto users are often fast-paced, which conflicts with the long-cycle nature of asset management. A step-by-step strategy is clearly unacceptable to users in an area characterized by the highest volatility. So highly leveraged crypto derivatives tend to be more popular. How the asset management protocol provides these policies and scenarios to users with low risk is very important. Note that I said low-risk offering, not low-risk creating profit.\n\nFor actively managed funds, it takes years of continuous management to have a chance of producing long-term average returns. For fund managers, the process is also relatively long. The cost of trust is higher than the copy trading function of a centralized exchange. So how asset management protocols ensure that users build trust in the face of these long turnaround periods is also important. So far, vault design and community fund rewards are viable mechanisms.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*sdqKbNItcSFVsGyR)\n\n*source: Token Terminal*\n\nIn addition, DeFi users tend to prefer the feeling of being in control of their money, and some good fund managers may not necessarily like full exposure to the chain portfolio. This prevents the agreement from attracting higher-quality fund managers and a larger number of DeFi users.\n\nHow to bridge the boundaries between privacy and initiative is important. Instant redemption, users’ rights to portfolio assets and the empowerment of managers’ equity are also important. From this point of view, investment kols with their own community attributes tend to be the priority of decentralized asset management protocols, while social tokens and NFT have obvious advantages in increasing tool availability and user asset flow.\n\n## Enzyme: Eliminate capital waste and welcome social return\n\n### 1/Integrate protocols and portfolio assets to improve capital efficiency\n\nEnzyme is a modification of Melon Protocol. They released version V4 this year, which has a lot of innovation beyond basic features like decentralized lending, AMM pools, and agricultural capabilities. Fund managers have access to a large number of functions outside the protocol. This protocol integrates Polygon, Uniswap V3, Opyn, Compound, Aave and other protocols.\n\nAt the same time, Gas Relayer’s new features allow asset managers to eliminate the high ethereum Gas fee burden and redefine the cost of the entire vault. To fully understand how this works, as well as its implications and best practices, we will soon be Posting a blog covering this.\n\nV4 allows users to customize the token/ticker symbol and customize around the user’s brand identity. Users can also transfer shares to new investors without redemption. This creates a secondary market for the user’s Treasury stock, which gives it the opportunity to trade. Users can invest in more than 200 assets here. The platform also enables organizations to run their own investment funds using Gnosis multi-signature wallets.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*MlO7nAiNukplj6sA)\n\n*source: Enzyme*\n\nEnzyme solves the problem of capital inefficiencies by integrating deployment with multiple protocols. Increase the availability of the agreement by borrowing and escrow assets. So Enzyme is definitely on the move when it comes to making broader gains. The allocation and use of idle assets to obtain immediate income increases the source of liquidity and income options. Better use of idle assets and LP tokens is an important reason why Enzyme is ahead.\n\n### 2/The key to winning: Personalized social investing trends\n\nEnzyme’s own Treasury creates a personalized vault, while users can easily copy on-chain policies. These designs greatly enhance users’ social security and freedom. Enzyme also improves security and depositor protection through a 7-day review period.\n\nV4 introduced a protocol fee for this protocol. The fee is a tax on the amount of assets under management in each vault. This is calculated continuously with respect to the annualized target percentage and results in the automatic casting of a certain number of additional shares for each vault and allocation to the agreement itself. The agreement uses a repo mechanism to force fund managers to demand MLN tokens. In addition, the burning of the MLN used for buybacks creates deflationary pressures on tokens.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*H6fCbtAAozyf-AQX)\n\n*source: DefiLlama*\n\nIn traditional finance, investing in hedge funds can be difficult for the average person. Launching hedge funds could be harder. Enzyme simplified and innovated the fund launch process, and the openness of the network they built in addition to improving transparency, democratized access for all investors. After years of development, Enzyme’s TVL hovers around $30 million.\n\nWe think Enzyme should pursue more social attempts to monetize smart elitist investment management. For investors, Enzyme lowers barriers to entry and improves transparency. As long as the Enzyme protocol continues to integrate and expand the scope of assets and focus on optimizing the long-term direction of composable financial instruments, the investability of assets across the chain will continue to increase.\n\nEven during bear markets, asset management protocols should consider a profit strategy on the downside. Fund managers can hold stablecoin assets and avoid the downward trend in profits. On this basis, how to create more investment options for users in a falling market is the problem to consider. For the two core stakeholders, it is only a matter of time before AUM rises in the future, as long as their enthusiasm can be stimulated.", "timestamp": 1656080693, "digest": "2a0GYBhiBG9Wp85mV0UVSxBJ9OZwaFDa5vvOopTZe04", "contributor": "0x867A3f354c0eCB6622aEf1bF14C3BE79338AD889"}

It details the story of the Corleone family, focusing on the patriarch Vito Corleone and his son Michael. The novel covers the years 1945 to 1955, and also includes flashbacks to events that occurred in 1902.\n\nThe book has been translated into over 20 languages and sold over 26 million copies worldwide. In 1972 it was adapted into a film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, which won three Academy Awards including Best Picture. The sequel, The Godfather: Part II was released in 1974 and received five Oscar nominations including Best Picture. A third movie based on Puzo's original screenplay but not directed by Coppola—The Godfather: Part III—was released in 1990 after Puzo's death; it received mixed reviews but was successful commercially nonetheless.\n\nPuzo wrote The Godfather as an attempt to \"capture...the strength of the American family unit.\" He wanted to show how \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\" while also exploring themes such as trustworthiness, betrayal, love and hate. Critics have praised Puzo's skillful characterization and plotting; many consider TheGodfather one of the greatest novels ever written about organized crime or America itself.", "timestamp": 1656081507, "digest": "7iub2av41mL2XYFveELJITtMV7igp5anRn2uqhzP3hM", "contributor": "0x230Fc4cdF11bdf8B0FBe6F43b154d19458c74D4c"}

Little, everyday decisions will either take you to the life you desire or to disaster by default. The Compound Effect is an easy-to-use, step-by-step operating system that allows you to multiply your success, chart your progress, and achieve any desire. If you’re serious about living an extraordinary life, use the power of The Compound Effect to create the success you want.\n\nI found this book very inspiring because it teaches how small changes over time can lead to big results. It’s a great reminder that we need to be deliberate in our actions and make conscious choices if we want to achieve our goals. I also liked how the author included case studies and examples of people who have applied these principles in their own lives with great success. This was helpful for me because it showed me that these concepts are not just theoretical but can be put into practice and used successfully by anyone willing to do the work required.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great book for anyone looking for real world strategies on how to create lasting change in their lives. It’s based on sound principles and provides clear instructions on how best to apply them so that anyone can see results if they commit themselves fully.\"", "timestamp": 1656082475, "digest": "WFgy3GejE-sQc5Uz8o54T-XZI8f2EKUV2fWfVQtqy7M", "contributor": "0x1D062534056a880C41c996F877CDcd956513ffa7"}

The term was popularized by Nassim Taleb in his book of the same name, which discusses the unpredictability of rare events in finance and other fields.\n\nBlack swans can be positive or negative events; for example, a company's successful IPO may be seen as a positive black swan, while its bankruptcy would be seen as a negative black swan. Black swans are typically outside of the realm of normal expectations and thus difficult to predict.\n\nThe existence of black swans is often used to argue against the use of historical data in financial analysis. Many believe that past performance cannot reliably indicate future results, because it's impossible to know which unexpected events will occur and have a significant impact on future outcomes.

一，NFTTrack的简单介绍\n\n一句话介绍蓝星对于nfttrack的定义：一个通过数据分析，追踪高胜率高回报地址的nft工具。\n\n推特：<https://twitter.com/NFTTrack> ，1.46万关注。\n\ndiscord：<https://discord.gg/28GA48hnmm> ，1430人。\n\n官方使用帮助手册：\n\n[🎒 NFTTrack Handbook](https://mirror.xyz/nfttrack.eth/6T-4NjVH0m0k3wfpTUbd_SPSvURz2nQp8L4qfu8g9JI)\n\n现在NFTTrack只有手机端，网页端也在计划之中，安卓和苹果手机都可以在应用商店搜索nfttrack下载到，苹果手机不需要国外苹果id就可以下载到。\n\n## 二,NFTtrack的功能介绍\n\n建议打开梯子来使用NFTTtrack，否则只能体验到一部分功能。\n\n下载好之后，打开手机，就会出现discover页面。\n\n![1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ruHknvr2ipjxKSGuTdmr0.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n先点击右下角的me，连接钱包，此处蓝星选择连接的是小狐狸钱包。可以看到，如果你的地址跟推特关联了，会自动显示你的推特名称。\n\n![2](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qF8DYbgZX-C0q947KExqL.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**下方有三个主菜单按钮，分别是巨鲸-top whale ，收藏品-collections，个人资料-me .**\n\n### 1, 巨鲸 top whale页面：following ,  discover,  rank\n\n**following 关注页面**\n\n点击左下角的top whale，再点击following，钱包签名以及推特授权之后，就可以看到下图，展示了你追踪的地址的交易记录，他们买了哪些nft，卖出了哪些nft ，mint了哪些nft。\n\n![3](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3yI3Lmp0eFP47GIhpJVj7.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**蓝星建议：卖出这里，如果能够加上当时买入价格或者mint 价格为多少，数量为多少，赚了多少，回报比多少，持有多长时间，就更好了。现在只是简单列出卖出收到了多少eth，了解不了更详细的信息**。\n\n![4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I3gw9ltXVQFUjKy5yDdFC.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**discover探索页面**\n\n探索页面，主要聚焦于巨鲸现在的交易行为。分为whalefomo, 以及whales activity。\n\n![5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SqDqPVYugmNnEjQyTRJKg.png?height=1722&width=792)\n\n点击whalefomo右边的more，会跳转到收藏品collections页面的whalefomo页面，可以查看不同时间段巨鲸们都在买卖什么样的nft。比如下图，有3个巨鲸在1个小时前购买了31只spunmonkes，总交易量14.62，平均价格为0.0153，现在的地板价为0.0048。\n\n![6](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5Z61xwzfZN-ko-QylTBEU.png?height=1644&width=794)\n\n点击spunmonkes,可以查看该项目的一些数据情况，比如地板价变化趋势，蓝筹指数，持有地址，手机端也集成了opensea, gem, looksrare，项目推特以及项目官网。\n\n**蓝星建议：应当集成x2y2，现在很多新项目，x2y2的交易量都是第二的。作为一个nft工具，不集成市场份额第二的nft交易平台X2Y2 ，感觉有点奇怪，并且X2Y2 的手续费只是0.5%，相比其他平台，可以为玩家节省蛮多费用**。\n\n![7](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ts30KJksNflWjjjEACCQK.png?height=1736&width=796)\n\n下方还有筹码分布，持有该项目的地址都持有哪些蓝筹项目，该项目的交易记录，上架数量等信息。\n\n**蓝星注：此处当然是筹码越分散，买的巨鲸地址越多，蓝筹指数不断增高，上架数量越少更好**。\n\n![8](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JUw1kOzCTrx-xSJW4Em2S.png?height=1676&width=788)\n\n回到topwhale的discover页面\n\n![9](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ePxNQBmirYF6GID_ERPV_.png?height=1720&width=808)\n\n点击hiten.eth，跳转到下图，有关于该巨鲸的数据，卖出排名，巨鲸排名，推特多少粉丝。\n\n![10](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/esrEUlMX8_SZ2B3tGPYgh.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n其中fliprate#4指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖的排名。\n\nwhale#503指：一段时间内该地址所有nft价值的排名。\n\nreturn指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报率。\n\nprofits指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报绝对值。\n\nfliprate指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖占所有交易次数的比率，蓝星这里理解为胜率。\n\ntotal floor value指：该地址现在持有的nft按照地板价计算的总eth价值。\n\ntotal cost指：该地址现在持有的nft当时买入的总成本。\n\nnfts指：该地址现在持有的nft总数量。\n\n显然，关注的指标，return 以及fliprate，还有total floor value/ total cost的比值应当越大越好，代表该地址的历史表现更好，该地址更值得关注。\n\nwhalefomo这里重点关注买入某个nft的巨鲸数量和买入卖出数量。\n\n**再点击rank，来到巨鲸排名页面，在这里可以发现很多值得关注的巨鲸地址，可以关注他们，追踪他们的交易记录，做追随策略**。\n\n如下图，胜率排名第一的761.eth，现在持有1180个nft，低买高卖的nft数量为95个，近7天有113次交易记录。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jfd-GpE3_M224yswnbSrs.png?height=1600&width=804)\n\n可以点击tennex.eth进入该地址主页，分析其数据。如下图，卖出的回报率return为11.88%，卖出利润profits为0.83，fliprate为81.25，这个数据不算高。现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为12.49，现在持有的nft总买入成本为5.9，12.49/5.9=2.11，这个比值不错，相当于翻倍了。下方就是该地址都持有哪些nft，以及该地址的买入卖出和mint行为。\n\n![12](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UQXdEKyl2vQpEvTji6YVN.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**再点击top whale>rank>return，进入按照30天卖出nft的回报率排名的巨鲸地址页面**。\n\n如下图，近30天回报率排名第一的是sina.eth这个地址，现在持有392个nft，近30天回报率1438倍，现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为1121个eth。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zXDjXHcBtPzhiw4qFzZQN.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**点击sina.eth，可以进入该地址的数据分析页面。卖出的nft回报率为35.6倍，利润绝对值为113个eth，胜率为90%。再看现在持有的nft除以买入总成本的比值，也很大，所以这个地址值得关注**。\n\n![14](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MP6mIbynF-_8brIHDzDMP.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**同样的，排名第三的地址也值得关注，但是最好去看下该地址价值最大的nft的组成。如果所有回报率都是早期持有bayc带来的，最近的交易记录反倒是亏损，就不太值得关注。**\n\n![15](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oNJIjuIs2CZAkwm-fPH1.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n### 2，collections：watchlist-观察列表，nextbluechip-下一个蓝筹项目，whalefomo-巨鲸在买啥\n\n点击下方菜单栏的collections按钮，如果你关注了某个项目，观察列表就会出现这些项目，可以看到总交易量，现在地板价，以及地板价相比前一天的涨幅。下图中可以看到，it’s nothing 以及 moonrunners 都在一天中涨了3倍。\n\n![16](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RBaxID40sPgIzmdCekmc8.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击nextbluechip，分别有1天，3天，7天的蓝筹指数变化情况。\n\n![17](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjHpeDct8D36KeEQyjp-t.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击whale fomo就是按照不同时间，有多少数量的巨鲸买入了多少数量的nft。moonrunners总量1万张，过去6小时，有44个巨鲸买入了56张。\n\n![18](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7E7nvl_2N4kuPL5twiRC-.png?height=1712&width=794)\n\n至于个人资料页面，就是你关注了什么项目，你关注的人的列表，还有你自己地址持有的nft，交易记录等。**因为没有集成x2y2，所以这个交易记录是不准确的，比如我是买了9个serious investor,这里只显示买了4个**。\n\n![19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pMZWXYhTuamF8Bzl28kWD.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n## 三，如何使用NFTtrack，心得体会\n\n1，首先当然是collections菜单栏的whale fomo值得关注，如果一个nft项目，有超过5个whale在集中大量购买，就要引起注意。如果买入的whale超过了100个地址，就要仔细分析是不是已经fomo到顶点了。一般来说，地板价和蓝筹指数随着whale fomo买入，都在不断抬升，就要引起注意。但是如果一天内地板价涨幅过高，比如超过3倍，也要小心你跟着买入是接盘侠，这个时候就要用到之前提到的nft 项目的判断模型。\n\n[bluestarpin.eth📜,📜+X2Y2 on Twitter: \"1，大势，团队，社区，赋能，数据分析。这5个点，是我总结下来判断NFT的一个框架。接下来分别说一说。 / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/lanxing4/status/1525086704079544320?s=20&t=D0EP3W8aRurILRDXmAk5hQ)\n\n2，其次是collections菜单栏的nextbluechip的蓝筹变化指数也值得关注。一个项目的蓝筹指数从0到30%的变化过程，往往伴随着地板价的大幅拉升。\n\n3，然后就是top whale菜单栏的rank页面的return的排名，可以发现一些值得关注的巨鲸地址。此处蓝星建议nfttrack开发地址的nft价值构成分析。我需要知道一个地址现在持有的nft的金额构成，以及回报率是哪些项目占据主导的。如果一个地址只是靠几笔交易获得了大的回报，那么这个地址的胜率就不是太好。就是要关注高胜率，高回报的地址，并且是最近30天也要有交易的，然后一定要跟自己的资金体量差不多的，毕竟适合自己的才是重要的。另外，推特粉丝太多的地址可以加入观察列表，但是不能全信，因为推特粉丝多，很多地址都是自己的小号，主力地址是被隐藏的。该地址的回报是有大量交易做支撑的，且资金体量跟你自己的差多，过去30天低买高卖的胜率超过85%，那么就值得关注。个人建议关注的地址要少而精，不要超过10个地址。关注地址列表也要不断的去芜存菁，根据你观察的胜率和回报率进行不断更新。\n\n##

The term was popularized by Nassim Taleb in his book of the same name, which discusses the unpredictability of rare events in finance and other fields.\n\nBlack swans can be positive or negative events; for example, a company's successful IPO may be seen as a positive black swan, while its bankruptcy would be seen as a negative black swan. Black swans are typically outside of the realm of normal expectations and thus difficult to predict.\n\nThe existence of black swans is often used to argue against the use of historical data in financial analysis. Many believe that past performance cannot reliably indicate future results, because it's impossible to know which unexpected events will occur and have a significant impact on future outcomes. This means that attempting to make decisions based on past trends may lead investors astray, as unforeseen events can cause these trends to reverse course abruptly.", "timestamp": 1656082181, "digest": "KaoycrvigGctTvDsM4xQBEkamu-yc0Liopx8LwAAfCI", "contributor": "0x26b6896bBbf5059e6fAf168945AeF5906bF570fA"}

LayerZero官方有一定合作关系，博Layerzero发币预期\n\n所以，对于Gh0stly Gh0sts这个NFT来说，全链协议的意义是啥？\n\n### 什么是全链？\n\n比如说，小幽灵Gh0stly Gh0sts就同时分布在7条链上（以太坊、Polygon、Arbitrum、Optimism、BSC、Avalanche、Fantom），我们可以通过跨链互操作性协议 LayerZero在不同的链之间进行转换，从而达到节省交易费用或者套利的效果。\n\n### 全链有什么优势吗？\n\n比如说，项目方在发行期间，可以考虑在多个layer2进行mint，可以很好地降低GAS消耗，而且不同的链目标人群也不同，有利于项目吸取不同链的流量。\n\n这是从NFT在应用层面的理解，关于技术方面的可以看看这篇文章，我觉得讲得还蛮好的。\n\n[https://foresightnews.pro/article/detail/2100](https://foresightnews.pro/article/detail/2100)\n\n我们还是回归到吃饭上面，说错了，是发币上面。\n\n### LayerZero发币了吗？\n\n还没。\n\n从目前已经融资的情况来看，发币是肯定的，而且以全链的应用场景，估值是有想象空间的。\n\n2021年9月，LayerZero Labs完成600万美元A轮融资，Multicoin和Binance Labs领投，Multicoin和Binance Labs领投，Sino Global Capital、Defiance等参投\n\n2022年3月，LayerZero Labs完成1.35亿美元融资，估值10亿美元，FTX Ventures、红杉资本与a16z领投。\n\n最近又在进行新一轮的融资，估值大概在30亿美元。\n\n### 如何体验LayerZero？\n\n**1、Stargate**\n\n链接：（<https://stargate.finance/>）\n\n集多项目功能于一身，桥、DEX、Farm、质押，最高的时候TVL有40亿，目前10亿左右。\n\n虽然Stargate已经发币，但是作为LayerZero上面锁仓量最大的项目，交互了它就是交互了LayerZero。\n\na. 跨链交易\n\n选择不同的链之间，进行交易\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FK6rq8n-REm4yML5iZsolY.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nb. 增加LP token\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FMjWeFod4TI1C9jy6vdy9r.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nc. 质押LP token\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FdTUZmSZW6Z9QlvJzUOo4q.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nd. 质押产生的 $STG 代币\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FcQJBAwKbYAuM0l0UxbTf8.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n就这几步完事了，每周交互几次，而且质押稳定币的收益还不算低，将近7%了，其实我没太懂，为何可以给到这么高的收益，毕竟TVL也不算小。\n\n考虑到安全性，我没敢把大仓位的稳定币搞进来，毕竟熊市了还是怕黑客搞事情，你们要是谁对这个质押的安全性有研究的，欢迎私聊我，一起聊聊。\n\n除了这个最大的协议之外，还有一些大家看情况交互。\n\n**2、gh0stlygh0sts**\n\n就是刚才说的全链NFT，下面是不同的链的购买地址，现在的价格是真的挺便宜的，有兴趣的买个玩玩\n\n[https://linktr.ee/b00tique](https://linktr.ee/b00tique)\n\n**3、parakeet.dao**\n\nNFT的跨链桥\n\n[https://www.parakeetdao.com/](https://www.parakeetdao.com/)\n\n**4、tiny dino**\n\n全链的像素NFT。\n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/tiny-dinos-eth](https://opensea.io/collection/tiny-dinos-eth)\n\n其他就没有太成熟的生态可以体验，重点是第一个**Stargate。**\n\n哦对，今天下午Stargate 发布更新 OP 代币分配的提案，计划将 100 万枚 OP 代币中的 70 万枚用于流动性挖矿计划，剩余 30 万枚用于合作伙伴计划，两项计划均将持续 6 个月。\n\n格局还是可以的，怪不得熊市了TVL还能撑住。\n\n以上就是我整理的关于LayerZero的介绍和项目交互建议，希望对大家撸毛有所帮助。", "timestamp": 1656082163, "digest": "e3j2sgqRZlYbeRcxtVALIJ4GMN63DH9oK_nNMg19VvI", "contributor": "0xfE9C2d9423Bb34a10EE5cdab28EBAdfb236A81c4"}

二,NFTtrack的功能介绍\n\n建议打开梯子来使用NFTTtrack，否则只能体验到一部分功能。\n\n下载好之后，打开手机，就会出现discover页面。\n\n![1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ruHknvr2ipjxKSGuTdmr0.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n先点击右下角的me，连接钱包，此处蓝星选择连接的是小狐狸钱包。可以看到，如果你的地址跟推特关联了，会自动显示你的推特名称。\n\n![2](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qF8DYbgZX-C0q947KExqL.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**下方有三个主菜单按钮，分别是巨鲸-top whale ，收藏品-collections，个人资料-me .**\n\n### 1, 巨鲸 top whale页面：following ,  discover,  rank\n\n**following 关注页面**\n\n点击左下角的top whale，再点击following，钱包签名以及推特授权之后，就可以看到下图，展示了你追踪的地址的交易记录，他们买了哪些nft，卖出了哪些nft ，mint了哪些nft。\n\n![3](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3yI3Lmp0eFP47GIhpJVj7.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**蓝星建议：卖出这里，如果能够加上当时买入价格或者mint 价格为多少，数量为多少，赚了多少，回报比多少，持有多长时间，就更好了。现在只是简单列出卖出收到了多少eth，了解不了更详细的信息**。\n\n![4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I3gw9ltXVQFUjKy5yDdFC.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**discover探索页面**\n\n探索页面，主要聚焦于巨鲸现在的交易行为。分为whalefomo, 以及whales activity。\n\n![5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SqDqPVYugmNnEjQyTRJKg.png?height=1722&width=792)\n\n点击whalefomo右边的more，会跳转到收藏品collections页面的whalefomo页面，可以查看不同时间段巨鲸们都在买卖什么样的nft。比如下图，有3个巨鲸在1个小时前购买了31只spunmonkes，总交易量14.62，平均价格为0.0153，现在的地板价为0.0048。\n\n![6](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5Z61xwzfZN-ko-QylTBEU.png?height=1644&width=794)\n\n点击spunmonkes,可以查看该项目的一些数据情况，比如地板价变化趋势，蓝筹指数，持有地址，手机端也集成了opensea, gem, looksrare，项目推特以及项目官网。\n\n**蓝星建议：应当集成x2y2，现在很多新项目，x2y2的交易量都是第二的。作为一个nft工具，不集成市场份额第二的nft交易平台X2Y2 ，感觉有点奇怪，并且X2Y2 的手续费只是0.5%，相比其他平台，可以为玩家节省蛮多费用**。\n\n![7](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ts30KJksNflWjjjEACCQK.png?height=1736&width=796)\n\n下方还有筹码分布，持有该项目的地址都持有哪些蓝筹项目，该项目的交易记录，上架数量等信息。\n\n**蓝星注：此处当然是筹码越分散，买的巨鲸地址越多，蓝筹指数不断增高，上架数量越少更好**。\n\n![8](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JUw1kOzCTrx-xSJW4Em2S.png?height=1676&width=788)\n\n回到topwhale的discover页面\n\n![9](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ePxNQBmirYF6GID_ERPV_.png?height=1720&width=808)\n\n点击hiten.eth，跳转到下图，有关于该巨鲸的数据，卖出排名，巨鲸排名，推特多少粉丝。\n\n![10](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/esrEUlMX8_SZ2B3tGPYgh.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n其中fliprate#4指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖的排名。\n\nwhale#503指：一段时间内该地址所有nft价值的排名。\n\nreturn指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报率。\n\nprofits指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报绝对值。\n\nfliprate指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖占所有交易次数的比率，蓝星这里理解为胜率。\n\ntotal floor value指：该地址现在持有的nft按照地板价计算的总eth价值。\n\ntotal cost指：该地址现在持有的nft当时买入的总成本。\n\nnfts指：该地址现在持有的nft总数量。\n\n显然，关注的指标，return 以及fliprate，还有total floor value/ total cost的比值应当越大越好，代表该地址的历史表现更好，该地址更值得关注。\n\nwhalefomo这里重点关注买入某个nft的巨鲸数量和买入卖出数量。\n\n**再点击rank，来到巨鲸排名页面，在这里可以发现很多值得关注的巨鲸地址，可以关注他们，追踪他们的交易记录，做追随策略**。\n\n如下图，胜率排名第一的761.eth，现在持有1180个nft，低买高卖的nft数量为95个，近7天有113次交易记录。\n\n![11](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M5OOMXR5pkZI_2WBJJucN.png?height=1718&width=800)\n\n可以点击761.eth进入该地址主页，分析其数据。如下图，卖出的回报率return为125.59%，卖出利润profits为178.81，fliprate为72.3%，这个数据不算高。现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为486，现在持有的nft总买入成本为479，486/479=1.014，这个比值蛮低的，代表最近该地址操作的不是太好。下方就是该地址都持有哪些nft，以及该地址的买入卖出和mint行为。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nmvB6y2FVx5GeSKcm7z4W.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**再点击top whale>rank>return，进入按照30天卖出nft的回报率排名的巨鲸地址页面**。\n\n如下图，近30天回报率排名第一的是sina.eth这个地址，现在持有392个nft，近30天回报率1438倍，现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为1121个eth。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zXDjXHcBtPzhiw4qFzZQN.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**点击sina.eth，可以进入该地址的数据分析页面。卖出的nft回报率为35.6倍，利润绝对值为113个eth，胜率为90%。再看现在持有的nft除以买入总成本的比值，也很大，所以这个地址值得关注**。\n\n![14](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MP6mIbynF-_8brIHDzDMP.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**同样的，排名第三的地址也值得关注，但是最好去看下该地址价值最大的nft的组成。如果所有回报率都是早期持有bayc带来的，最近的交易记录反倒是亏损，就不太值得关注。**\n\n![15](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oNJIjuIs2CZAkwm-fPH1.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n### 2，collections：watchlist-观察列表，nextbluechip-下一个蓝筹项目，whalefomo-巨鲸在买啥\n\n点击下方菜单栏的collections按钮，如果你关注了某个项目，观察列表就会出现这些项目，可以看到总交易量，现在地板价，以及地板价相比前一天的涨幅。下图中可以看到，it’s nothing 以及 moonrunners 都在一天中涨了3倍。\n\n![16](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RBaxID40sPgIzmdCekmc8.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击nextbluechip，分别有1天，3天，7天的蓝筹指数变化情况。\n\n![17](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjHpeDct8D36KeEQyjp-t.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击whale fomo就是按照不同时间，有多少数量的巨鲸买入了多少数量的nft。moonrunners总量1万张，过去6小时，有44个巨鲸买入了56张。\n\n![18](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7E7nvl_2N4kuPL5twiRC-.png?height=1712&width=794)\n\n至于个人资料页面，就是你关注了什么项目，你关注的人的列表，还有你自己地址持有的nft，交易记录等。**因为没有集成x2y2，所以这个交易记录是不准确的，比如我是买了9个serious investor,这里只显示买了4个**。\n\n![19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pMZWXYhTuamF8Bzl28kWD.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n## 三，如何使用NFTtrack，心得体会\n\n1，首先当然是collections菜单栏的whale fomo值得关注，如果一个nft项目，有超过5个whale在集中大量购买，就要引起注意。如果买入的whale超过了100个地址，就要仔细分析是不是已经fomo到顶点了。一般来说，地板价和蓝筹指数随着whale fomo买入，都在不断抬升，就要引起注意。但是如果一天内地板价涨幅过高，比如超过3倍，也要小心你跟着买入是接盘侠，这个时候就要用到之前提到的nft 项目的判断模型。\n\n[bluestarpin.eth📜,📜+X2Y2 on Twitter: \"1，大势，团队，社区，赋能，数据分析。这5个点，是我总结下来判断NFT的一个框架。接下来分别说一说。 / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/lanxing4/status/1525086704079544320?s=20&t=D0EP3W8aRurILRDXmAk5hQ)\n\n2，其次是collections菜单栏的nextbluechip的蓝筹变化指数也值得关注。一个项目的蓝筹指数从0到30%的变化过程，往往伴随着地板价的大幅拉升。\n\n3，然后就是top whale菜单栏的rank页面的return的排名，可以发现一些值得关注的巨鲸地址。此处蓝星建议nfttrack开发地址的nft价值构成分析。我需要知道一个地址现在持有的nft的金额构成，以及回报率是哪些项目占据主导的。如果一个地址只是靠几笔交易获得了大的回报，那么这个地址的胜率就不是太好。就是要关注高胜率，高回报的地址，并且是最近30天也要有交易的，然后一定要跟自己的资金体量差不多的，毕竟适合自己的才是重要的。另外，推特粉丝太多的地址可以加入观察列表，但是不能全信，因为推特粉丝多，很多地址都是自己的小号，主力地址是被隐藏的。该地址的回报是有大量交易做支撑的，且资金体量跟你自己的差多，过去30天低买高卖的胜率超过85%，那么就值得关注。个人建议关注的地址要少而精，不要超过10个地址。关注地址列表也要不断的去芜存菁，根据你观察的胜率和回报率进行不断更新。\n\n## 四，聪明钱钱包地址\n\nNFTTrack团队从后台数据给了我两份地址清单\n\n### 值得关注的蓝筹地址清单\n\nsina.eth,[https://twitter.com/sina_eth_,

The book has sold over one million copies and has been translated into seventeen languages. The revised edition includes updated commentary by noted financial journalist Jason Zweig, whose perspective incorporates the realities of today's market. In this three paragraph essay I will discuss why this book is so highly acclaimed and what you can learn from it.\n\nThe Intelligent Investor is a comprehensive guide to stock market investing that covers topics such as diversification, value investing, and margin buying. Graham's philosophy of \"value investing\" shields investors from substantial error and teaches them to develop long-term strategies; something that has been proven wise time and again given the volatility of the stock market. What makes this book so valuable for modern investors is not only its timeless wisdom but also Jason Zweig's insightful commentary which provides parallels between Graham's examples and today's financial headlines. \n \n\nThe Intelligent Investor is a must read for anyone looking to invest in the stock market. Here are 10 reasons why:\n\n1. The book provides an overview of the stock market and how it works.\n2. It teaches you how to value stocks and make informed investment decisions.\n3. The book offers sound advice on when to buy and sell stocks.\n4. It provides a wealth of information on different types of investments, including bonds, mutual funds, and real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n5. The Intelligent Investor teaches you how to protect your portfolio from risk factors such as inflation and interest rates fluctuations .\n   6 .The book includes detailed instructions on constructing a well-diversified portfolio that meets your specific needs .  7 .It offers practical tips for rebalancing your portfolio regularly 8) The Intelligent Investor discusses important behavioral finance concepts that every investor should be aware of 9)The book has been updated over time to reflect current market conditions 10 )Ultimately, the goal of reading The Intelligent Investor is to help you become a more successful investor", "timestamp": 1656082646, "digest": "KEYo0iylihc_q7IbZ4vHA03ijuhs3de-6N_4HQITxlQ", "contributor": "0xaAFc32040657d33F317544Aaf0F1281D83bC4DEB"}

一，NFTTrack的简单介绍\n\n一句话介绍蓝星对于nfttrack的定义：一个通过数据分析，追踪高胜率高回报地址的nft工具。\n\n推特：<https://twitter.com/NFTTrack> ，1.46万关注。\n\ndiscord：<https://discord.gg/28GA48hnmm> ，1430人。\n\n官方使用帮助手册：\n\n[🎒 NFTTrack Handbook](https://mirror.xyz/nfttrack.eth/6T-4NjVH0m0k3wfpTUbd_SPSvURz2nQp8L4qfu8g9JI)\n\n现在NFTTrack只有手机端，网页端也在计划之中，安卓和苹果手机都可以在应用商店搜索nfttrack下载到，苹果手机不需要国外苹果id就可以下载到。\n\n## 二,NFTtrack的功能介绍\n\n建议打开梯子来使用NFTTtrack，否则只能体验到一部分功能。\n\n下载好之后，打开手机，就会出现discover页面。\n\n![1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ruHknvr2ipjxKSGuTdmr0.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n先点击右下角的me，连接钱包，此处蓝星选择连接的是小狐狸钱包。可以看到，如果你的地址跟推特关联了，会自动显示你的推特名称。\n\n![2](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qF8DYbgZX-C0q947KExqL.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**下方有三个主菜单按钮，分别是巨鲸-top whale ，收藏品-collections，个人资料-me .**\n\n### 1, 巨鲸 top whale页面：following ,  discover,  rank\n\n**following 关注页面**\n\n点击左下角的top whale，再点击following，钱包签名以及推特授权之后，就可以看到下图，展示了你追踪的地址的交易记录，他们买了哪些nft，卖出了哪些nft ，mint了哪些nft。\n\n![3](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3yI3Lmp0eFP47GIhpJVj7.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**蓝星建议：卖出这里，如果能够加上当时买入价格或者mint 价格为多少，数量为多少，赚了多少，回报比多少，持有多长时间，就更好了。现在只是简单列出卖出收到了多少eth，了解不了更详细的信息**。\n\n![4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I3gw9ltXVQFUjKy5yDdFC.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**discover探索页面**\n\n探索页面，主要聚焦于巨鲸现在的交易行为。分为whalefomo, 以及whales activity。\n\n![5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SqDqPVYugmNnEjQyTRJKg.png?height=1722&width=792)\n\n点击whalefomo右边的more，会跳转到收藏品collections页面的whalefomo页面，可以查看不同时间段巨鲸们都在买卖什么样的nft。比如下图，有3个巨鲸在1个小时前购买了31只spunmonkes，总交易量14.62，平均价格为0.0153，现在的地板价为0.0048。\n\n![6](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5Z61xwzfZN-ko-QylTBEU.png?height=1644&width=794)\n\n点击spunmonkes,可以查看该项目的一些数据情况，比如地板价变化趋势，蓝筹指数，持有地址，手机端也集成了opensea, gem, looksrare，项目推特以及项目官网。\n\n**蓝星建议：应当集成x2y2，现在很多新项目，x2y2的交易量都是第二的。作为一个nft工具，不集成市场份额第二的nft交易平台X2Y2 ，感觉有点奇怪，并且X2Y2 的手续费只是0.5%，相比其他平台，可以为玩家节省蛮多费用**。\n\n![7](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ts30KJksNflWjjjEACCQK.png?height=1736&width=796)\n\n下方还有筹码分布，持有该项目的地址都持有哪些蓝筹项目，该项目的交易记录，上架数量等信息。\n\n**蓝星注：此处当然是筹码越分散，买的巨鲸地址越多，蓝筹指数不断增高，上架数量越少更好**。\n\n![8](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JUw1kOzCTrx-xSJW4Em2S.png?height=1676&width=788)\n\n回到topwhale的discover页面\n\n![9](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ePxNQBmirYF6GID_ERPV_.png?height=1720&width=808)\n\n点击hiten.eth，跳转到下图，有关于该巨鲸的数据，卖出排名，巨鲸排名，推特多少粉丝。\n\n![10](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/esrEUlMX8_SZ2B3tGPYgh.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n其中fliprate#4指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖的排名。\n\nwhale#503指：一段时间内该地址所有nft价值的排名。\n\nreturn指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报率。\n\nprofits指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报绝对值。\n\nfliprate指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖占所有交易次数的比率，蓝星这里理解为胜率。\n\ntotal floor value指：该地址现在持有的nft按照地板价计算的总eth价值。\n\ntotal cost指：该地址现在持有的nft当时买入的总成本。\n\nnfts指：该地址现在持有的nft总数量。\n\n显然，关注的指标，return 以及fliprate，还有total floor value/ total cost的比值应当越大越好，代表该地址的历史表现更好，该地址更值得关注。\n\nwhalefomo这里重点关注买入某个nft的巨鲸数量和买入卖出数量。\n\n**再点击rank，来到巨鲸排名页面，在这里可以发现很多值得关注的巨鲸地址，可以关注他们，追踪他们的交易记录，做追随策略**。\n\n如下图，胜率排名第一的761.eth，现在持有1180个nft，低买高卖的nft数量为95个，近7天有113次交易记录。\n\n![11](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M5OOMXR5pkZI_2WBJJucN.png?height=1718&width=800)\n\n可以点击761.eth进入该地址主页，分析其数据。如下图，卖出的回报率return为125.59%，卖出利润profits为178.81，fliprate为72.3%，这个数据不算高。现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为486，现在持有的nft总买入成本为479，486/479=1.014，这个比值蛮低的，代表最近该地址操作的不是太好。下方就是该地址都持有哪些nft，以及该地址的买入卖出和mint行为。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nmvB6y2FVx5GeSKcm7z4W.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**再点击top whale>rank>return，进入按照30天卖出nft的回报率排名的巨鲸地址页面**。\n\n如下图，近30天回报率排名第一的是sina.eth这个地址，现在持有392个nft，近30天回报率1438倍，现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为1121个eth。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zXDjXHcBtPzhiw4qFzZQN.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**点击sina.eth，可以进入该地址的数据分析页面。卖出的nft回报率为35.6倍，利润绝对值为113个eth，胜率为90%。再看现在持有的nft除以买入总成本的比值，也很大，所以这个地址值得关注**。\n\n![14](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MP6mIbynF-_8brIHDzDMP.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**同样的，排名第三的地址也值得关注，但是最好去看下该地址价值最大的nft的组成。如果所有回报率都是早期持有bayc带来的，最近的交易记录反倒是亏损，就不太值得关注。**\n\n![15](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oNJIjuIs2CZAkwm-fPH1.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n### 2，collections：watchlist-观察列表，nextbluechip-下一个蓝筹项目，whalefomo-巨鲸在买啥\n\n点击下方菜单栏的collections按钮，如果你关注了某个项目，观察列表就会出现这些项目，可以看到总交易量，现在地板价，以及地板价相比前一天的涨幅。下图中可以看到，it’s nothing 以及 moonrunners 都在一天中涨了3倍。\n\n![16](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RBaxID40sPgIzmdCekmc8.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击nextbluechip，分别有1天，3天，7天的蓝筹指数变化情况。\n\n![17](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjHpeDct8D36KeEQyjp-t.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击whale fomo就是按照不同时间，有多少数量的巨鲸买入了多少数量的nft。moonrunners总量1万张，过去6小时，有44个巨鲸买入了56张。\n\n![18](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7E7nvl_2N4kuPL5twiRC-.png?height=1712&width=794)\n\n至于个人资料页面，就是你关注了什么项目，你关注的人的列表，还有你自己地址持有的nft，交易记录等。**因为没有集成x2y2，所以这个交易记录是不准确的，比如我是买了9个serious investor,这里只显示买了4个**。\n\n![19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pMZWXYhTuamF8Bzl28kWD.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n## 三，如何使用NFTtrack，心得体会\n\n1，首先当然是collections菜单栏的whale fomo值得关注，如果一个nft项目，有超过5个whale在集中大量购买，就要引起注意。如果买入的whale超过了100个地址，就要仔细分析是不是已经fomo到顶点了。一般来说，地板价和蓝筹指数随着whale fomo买入，都在不断抬升，就要引起注意。但是如果一天内地板价涨幅过高，比如超过3倍，也要小心你跟着买入是接盘侠，这个时候就要用到之前提到的nft 项目的判断模型。\n\n[bluestarpin.eth📜,📜+X2Y2 on Twitter: \"1，大势，团队，社区，赋能，数据分析。这5个点，是我总结下来判断NFT的一个框架。接下来分别说一说。 / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/lanxing4/status/1525086704079544320?s=20&t=D0EP3W8aRurILRDXmAk5hQ)\n\n2，其次是collections菜单栏的nextbluechip的蓝筹变化指数也值得关注。一个项目的蓝筹指数从0到30%的变化过程，往往伴随着地板价的大幅拉升。\n\n3，然后就是top whale菜单栏的rank页面的return的排名，可以发现一些值得关注的巨鲸地址。此处蓝星建议nfttrack开发地址的nft价值构成分析。我需要知道一个地址现在持有的nft的金额构成，以及回报率是哪些项目占据主导的。如果一个地址只是靠几笔交易获得了大的回报，那么这个地址的胜率就不是太好。就是要关注高胜率，高回报的地址，并且是最近30天也要有交易的，然后一定要跟自己的资金体量差不多的，毕竟适合自己的才是重要的。另外，推特粉丝太多的地址可以加入观察列表，但是不能全信，因为推特粉丝多，很多地址都是自己的小号，主力地址是被隐藏的。该地址的回报是有大量交易做支撑的，且资金体量跟你自己的差多，过去30天低买高卖的胜率超过85%，那么就值得关注。个人建议关注的地址要少而精，不要超过10个地址。关注地址列表也要不断的去芜存菁，根据你观察的胜率和回报率进行不断更新。\n\n##

It is only focused on integrity and authentication. Both goals form the backbone for decentralization as it allows anyone to verify: \n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nWe call this property *public verifiability* as anyone can fetch the data from an untrusted source and check if the relevant computation was performed correctly.

A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity. They can compute the credentials (public-private key pair) locally on their machine. The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer. A signature is timeless and it can be verified at any point in time. In fact, we can check all historical transactions in a network like Bitcoin and verify the signer was indeed authorised to spend the coins.\n\nWhat about zero knowledge proofs?", "timestamp": 1656082790, "digest": "a4Y0TrLL7BcS8rarDfDVQW6HJKSTydm5K7u2sEqC2wA", "contributor": "0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5"}

{"id": "MstGQK-PD9AfQlj1a58TTtrc3vx6T4TBRAsYpalCyV8", "title": "The \"crypto\" in cryptocurrency", "body": "The word “crypto” may spark images in your mind of ciphers, code breaking and even Bletchley park’s involvement in World War 2. I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). From his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. The idea that information wants to find its way into every nook and cranny does have consequences (for the better or worse). For example, information leaks can help us learn about atrocities committed by government, but it can also be used by the government for surveillance of its citizens. \n\nCryptography is a tool that enables us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. It has similarities to the perspective of David vs Goliath as cryptography is one of the only tools that allows a citizen to successfully fend against a nation state actor. In fact, for most of cryptography’s history, it is a tool that allows the defender to protect itself from an all-powerful adversary. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA protocol designed using cryptography tends to have three goals: \n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is not concerned with confidentiality. It is only focused on integrity and authentication. Both goals form the backbone for decentralization as it allows anyone to verify: \n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nWe call this property *public verifiability* as anyone can fetch the data from an untrusted source and check if the relevant computation was performed correctly. This property is crucial to protect coins held by users on the network. If the public cannot get access to the data or lacks a mechanism to check whether it is correct, then it is a trusted system.\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\n**Not an anonymous currency.** Many people find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange at first. I suspect this is the case because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use in the dark web. The very name *crypto*currency leads to that misunderstanding. Unfortunately for criminals, they are the most traceable currencies in the world and it is a really bad tool for their desired purpose. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose.\n\n**Privacy-coins do exist.** Confidentiality of financial transactions on a global scale is a sought-after feature. A number of systems exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. is a sought-after property and there are a number of systems with strong confidentiality including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. I believe this frontier of research and development is essential for the continued growth of decentralised finance (DeFi).\n\nA fun project is to list the existing DeFI applications and identify which aspects can benefit from financial privacy. But for now, we do not concern ourselves with confidentiality. It is not needed to understand how cryptography is immediately used in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThe cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is basic. There are only two primitives to consider. A commitment scheme to protect the integrity of the blockchain and digital signatures to authenticate actions from an end-user. We have put together dedicated articles for both primitives and in this article we provide a brief explanation of each.\n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature.

二,NFTtrack的功能介绍\n\n建议打开梯子来使用NFTTtrack，否则只能体验到一部分功能。\n\n下载好之后，打开手机，就会出现discover页面。\n\n![1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ruHknvr2ipjxKSGuTdmr0.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n先点击右下角的me，连接钱包，此处蓝星选择连接的是小狐狸钱包。可以看到，如果你的地址跟推特关联了，会自动显示你的推特名称。\n\n![2](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qF8DYbgZX-C0q947KExqL.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**下方有三个主菜单按钮，分别是巨鲸-top whale ，收藏品-collections，个人资料-me .**\n\n### 1, 巨鲸 top whale页面：following ,  discover,  rank\n\n**following 关注页面**\n\n点击左下角的top whale，再点击following，钱包签名以及推特授权之后，就可以看到下图，展示了你追踪的地址的交易记录，他们买了哪些nft，卖出了哪些nft

以及whales activity。\n\n![5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SqDqPVYugmNnEjQyTRJKg.png?height=1722&width=792)\n\n点击whalefomo右边的more，会跳转到收藏品collections页面的whalefomo页面，可以查看不同时间段巨鲸们都在买卖什么样的nft。比如下图，有3个巨鲸在1个小时前购买了31只spunmonkes，总交易量14.62，平均价格为0.0153，现在的地板价为0.0048。\n\n![6](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5Z61xwzfZN-ko-QylTBEU.png?height=1644&width=794)\n\n点击spunmonkes,可以查看该项目的一些数据情况，比如地板价变化趋势，蓝筹指数，持有地址，手机端也集成了opensea, gem, looksrare，项目推特以及项目官网。\n\n**蓝星建议：应当集成x2y2，现在很多新项目，x2y2的交易量都是第二的。作为一个nft工具，不集成市场份额第二的nft交易平台X2Y2 ，感觉有点奇怪，并且X2Y2 的手续费只是0.5%，相比其他平台，可以为玩家节省蛮多费用**。\n\n![7](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ts30KJksNflWjjjEACCQK.png?height=1736&width=796)\n\n下方还有筹码分布，持有该项目的地址都持有哪些蓝筹项目，该项目的交易记录，上架数量等信息。\n\n**蓝星注：此处当然是筹码越分散，买的巨鲸地址越多，蓝筹指数不断增高，上架数量越少更好**。\n\n![8](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JUw1kOzCTrx-xSJW4Em2S.png?height=1676&width=788)\n\n回到topwhale的discover页面\n\n![9](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ePxNQBmirYF6GID_ERPV_.png?height=1720&width=808)\n\n点击hiten.eth，跳转到下图，有关于该巨鲸的数据，卖出排名，巨鲸排名，推特多少粉丝。\n\n![10](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/esrEUlMX8_SZ2B3tGPYgh.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n其中fliprate#4指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖的排名。\n\nwhale#503指：一段时间内该地址所有nft价值的排名。\n\nreturn指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报率。\n\nprofits指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报绝对值。\n\nfliprate指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖占所有交易次数的比率，蓝星这里理解为胜率。\n\ntotal floor value指：该地址现在持有的nft按照地板价计算的总eth价值。\n\ntotal cost指：该地址现在持有的nft当时买入的总成本。\n\nnfts指：该地址现在持有的nft总数量。\n\n显然，关注的指标，return 以及fliprate，还有total floor value/ total cost的比值应当越大越好，代表该地址的历史表现更好，该地址更值得关注。\n\nwhalefomo这里重点关注买入某个nft的巨鲸数量和买入卖出数量。\n\n**再点击rank，来到巨鲸排名页面，在这里可以发现很多值得关注的巨鲸地址，可以关注他们，追踪他们的交易记录，做追随策略**。\n\n如下图，胜率排名第一的761.eth，现在持有1180个nft，低买高卖的nft数量为95个，近7天有113次交易记录。\n\n![11](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M5OOMXR5pkZI_2WBJJucN.png?height=1718&width=800)\n\n可以点击761.eth进入该地址主页，分析其数据。如下图，卖出的回报率return为125.59%，卖出利润profits为178.81，fliprate为72.3%，这个数据不算高。现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为486，现在持有的nft总买入成本为479，486/479=1.014，这个比值蛮低的，代表最近该地址操作的不是太好。下方就是该地址都持有哪些nft，以及该地址的买入卖出和mint行为。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nmvB6y2FVx5GeSKcm7z4W.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**再点击top whale>rank>return，进入按照30天卖出nft的回报率排名的巨鲸地址页面**。\n\n如下图，近30天回报率排名第一的是sina.eth这个地址，现在持有392个nft，近30天回报率1438倍，现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为1121个eth。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zXDjXHcBtPzhiw4qFzZQN.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**点击sina.eth，可以进入该地址的数据分析页面。卖出的nft回报率为35.6倍，利润绝对值为113个eth，胜率为90%。再看现在持有的nft除以买入总成本的比值，也很大，所以这个地址值得关注**。\n\n![14](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MP6mIbynF-_8brIHDzDMP.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**同样的，排名第三的地址也值得关注，但是最好去看下该地址价值最大的nft的组成。如果所有回报率都是早期持有bayc带来的，最近的交易记录反倒是亏损，就不太值得关注。**\n\n![15](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oNJIjuIs2CZAkwm-fPH1.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n### 2，collections：watchlist-观察列表，nextbluechip-下一个蓝筹项目，whalefomo-巨鲸在买啥\n\n点击下方菜单栏的collections按钮，如果你关注了某个项目，观察列表就会出现这些项目，可以看到总交易量，现在地板价，以及地板价相比前一天的涨幅。下图中可以看到，it’s nothing 以及 moonrunners 都在一天中涨了3倍。\n\n![16](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RBaxID40sPgIzmdCekmc8.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击nextbluechip，分别有1天，3天，7天的蓝筹指数变化情况。\n\n![17](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjHpeDct8D36KeEQyjp-t.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击whale fomo就是按照不同时间，有多少数量的巨鲸买入了多少数量的nft。moonrunners总量1万张，过去6小时，有44个巨鲸买入了56张。\n\n![18](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7E7nvl_2N4kuPL5twiRC-.png?height=1712&width=794)\n\n至于个人资料页面，就是你关注了什么项目，你关注的人的列表，还有你自己地址持有的nft，交易记录等。**因为没有集成x2y2，所以这个交易记录是不准确的，比如我是买了9个serious investor,这里只显示买了4个**。\n\n![19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pMZWXYhTuamF8Bzl28kWD.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n## 三，如何使用NFTtrack，心得体会\n\n1，首先当然是collections菜单栏的whale fomo值得关注，如果一个nft项目，有超过5个whale在集中大量购买，就要引起注意。如果买入的whale超过了100个地址，就要仔细分析是不是已经fomo到顶点了。一般来说，地板价和蓝筹指数随着whale fomo买入，都在不断抬升，就要引起注意。但是如果一天内地板价涨幅过高，比如超过3倍，也要小心你跟着买入是接盘侠，这个时候就要用到之前提到的nft 项目的判断模型。\n\n[bluestarpin.eth📜,📜+X2Y2 on Twitter: \"1，大势，团队，社区，赋能，数据分析。这5个点，是我总结下来判断NFT的一个框架。接下来分别说一说。 / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/lanxing4/status/1525086704079544320?s=20&t=D0EP3W8aRurILRDXmAk5hQ)\n\n2，其次是collections菜单栏的nextbluechip的蓝筹变化指数也值得关注。一个项目的蓝筹指数从0到30%的变化过程，往往伴随着地板价的大幅拉升。\n\n3，然后就是top whale菜单栏的rank页面的return的排名，可以发现一些值得关注的巨鲸地址。此处蓝星建议nfttrack开发地址的nft价值构成分析。我需要知道一个地址现在持有的nft的金额构成，以及回报率是哪些项目占据主导的。如果一个地址只是靠几笔交易获得了大的回报，那么这个地址的胜率就不是太好。就是要关注高胜率，高回报的地址，并且是最近30天也要有交易的，然后一定要跟自己的资金体量差不多的，毕竟适合自己的才是重要的。另外，推特粉丝太多的地址可以加入观察列表，但是不能全信，因为推特粉丝多，很多地址都是自己的小号，主力地址是被隐藏的。该地址的回报是有大量交易做支撑的，且资金体量跟你自己的差多，过去30天低买高卖的胜率超过85%，那么就值得关注。个人建议关注的地址要少而精，不要超过10个地址。关注地址列表也要不断的去芜存菁，根据你观察的胜率和回报率进行不断更新。\n\n##

The DAO’s organizational structure naturally removes organizational barriers to decentralized asset management. Enzyme, a pioneer of multi-chain asset management protocols, was created in 2016. More importantly, it can use tokens to incentivise asset issuers and liquidity participants to tap into more decentralized financial scenarios.\n\nFrom flatter investment decision-making systems, to incentives to participate in product beta versions, to the formation of vast armies of capital in the upcoming metaverse. These new tools will be a force to be reckoned with once the asset management protocol has achieved the integration of tokens with the community.\n\nEnzyme allows users to make speculative bets using liquid assets. With the development of decentralized asset management protocols and the emergence of new ways to interact with the “X-to-earn” social paradigm beyond DeFi boundaries, we can expect to see an influx of user demand for such tokens.\n\nNew players are entering the new management game.\n\n## Decentralized asset management: an attempt to return to classical equilibrium\n\nDue to the nature of centralization and barriers, traditional asset management is a high-cost and high-friction industry. The core of decentralized asset management is to optimize the traditional asset management process.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*j8yfKo1c9dmnsVoV)\n\n*source: coingecko*\n\n### 1/ 9 advantages of decentralized asset management\n\nDecentralized asset management utilizing blockchain and smart contract technology has the following advantages:\n\n\\*\\*1. Effectively reducing start-up costs. \\*\\*This is arguably the most important and immediate improvement. In traditional finance, creating a fund requires high compliance, registration and notarization fees. But the cost of starting a fund on a blockchain is low.\n\n\\*\\*2. Greatly shorten the startup time. \\*\\*The traditional fund creation process can take months. The decentralized alternative only takes a few minutes.\n\n\\*\\*3.Anyone can be a fund manager. \\*\\*Blockchains and smart contracts allow anyone with a computer to build their own investment vehicles.\n\n\\*\\*4.Anyone can be a fund investor. \\*\\*Top fund investment opportunities are limited to qualified investors with net assets of several million dollars, while decentralized asset management does not limit the size of funds.\n\n\\*\\*5. Strictly enforced terms of authorization. \\*\\*Traditional fund rules and licensing agreements are often enforced subjectively by fund managers and can still be broken at their discretion. Blockchain-based funds can make rules strictly algorithmic, leaving fund managers with no choice but to follow predefined rules.\n\n\\*\\*6. Based on the principle of untrusteeship/no trust. \\*\\*In blockchain-based funds, fund managers do not have the right to trust or withdraw investors’ money, but can only use it to execute certain investments.\n\n\\*\\*7. More liquidity. \\*\\*Most traditional fund redemptions are usually quarterly. Blockchain-based funds can greatly increase investor liquidity, and protocols can allow instant redemption depending on the actual state of the fund’s position on the chain.\n\n\\*\\*8. Transparency. \\*\\*Foundations in the traditional asset management world are often closed and relatively opaque because of their reliance on real-life contracts, external auditors and non-real-time reporting. A fund built on blockchain is completely transparent, with all changes in its portfolio updated in real time.\n\n\\*\\*9. Composability. \\*\\*Decentralized finance has evolved into a set of interconnected and modular monetary Legos. This allows decentralized asset management to easily plug into other DeFi services for trading, extending leverage, insurance, swaps and other product capabilities. That gives investors more choice\n\n### 2/ The appeal of active on-chain money management\n\nAsset management in DeFi can be divided into the following three categories:\n\n1\\. Active on-chain fund management (active management)\n\n2\\. Index products and basket currencies (passively managed)\n\n3\\. Structured products and vault based products\n\nThis paper deals only with the field of active on-chain fund management. Historically, actively managed funds have generally outperformed passive basket indices, or DPI indices. Actively managed funds tend to do better in downturns. Of course, passive asset management protocols usually have advantages in attracting capital, but in maintaining the efficiency of capital operation, they often encounter the problem of liquidity disloyalty, which can only be overcome by the unsustainable way of high-yield mining.\n\nMotivating teams and users to develop high-yield Alpha strategies is an issue that needs to be considered in every asset management agreement, regardless of type. But with passive asset management protocols, the big returns are often available only to a few. This can lead to a long time gap between protocol product development and capital strategy execution. Active funds, by contrast, can change strategies and compete for capital more quickly because of the large number of managers and often only need to capture high-return speculative assets and trade in secondary markets.\n\nOf course, the discretion of asset management protocols is also a double-edged sword. High yields may be a moat for passive management protocols, but robustness and diversification are preferred for active management protocols. Ongoing policy maintenance and optimization is a good starting point for socializing. Recent large-scale DeFi liquidations have proven that agreements that are divorced from communities and violate the principle of decentralization cannot ensure capital efficiency.\n\n## A difficult attempt to socialize asset management\n\n### 1/Cater to the personalized needs of crypto users\n\nOn-chain asset management ensures that investors have no trust in the custody of capital. Transparent ledgers reduce the cost burden of complex accounting and auditing. At the same time, DeFi’s permitless access provides users with open access rights. This means that the cost of launching a hedge fund in the blockchain world is limited to a small amount of Gas fees.\n\nHowever, the TVL of decentralized asset management protocols is small. Why hasn’t something with such high product fit expanded rapidly so far? The main thing is that the space is still getting more social traction. While this segment of the market may be immature relative to other DeFi products, its acceptance so far has been very encouraging.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*wZZaZxYBHowzDo5n)\n\n*source: Enzyme*\n\nCryptographic native protocols are building a toolkit for decentralized money management in a variety of ways. We may see crypto-native asset management protocols become popular before more mainstream traditional institutions take action. Social tokens allow users to make interesting trades on speculative assets. These on-chain assets are traded based on individual needs in a decentralized asset management approach.\n\nWeb3.0 and crypto native tokens may not simply be a one-to-one copy of TradFi onto the blockchain. While cost reduction is important, it is mechanism design and the development of unique products based on smart contracts that are likely to attract users. Unfortunately, innovative decentralized asset management infrastructures often have little to offer in terms of innovative mechanisms.\n\n### 2/ Why hasn’t there been a pandemic?\n\nThe asset management habits of crypto users are often fast-paced, which conflicts with the long-cycle nature of asset management. A step-by-step strategy is clearly unacceptable to users in an area characterized by the highest volatility. So highly leveraged crypto derivatives tend to be more popular. How the asset management protocol provides these policies and scenarios to users with low risk is very important. Note that I said low-risk offering, not low-risk creating profit.\n\nFor actively managed funds, it takes years of continuous management to have a chance of producing long-term average returns. For fund managers, the process is also relatively long. The cost of trust is higher than the copy trading function of a centralized exchange. So how asset management protocols ensure that users build trust in the face of these long turnaround periods is also important. So far, vault design and community fund rewards are viable mechanisms.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*sdqKbNItcSFVsGyR)\n\n*source: Token Terminal*\n\nIn addition, DeFi users tend to prefer the feeling of being in control of their money, and some good fund managers may not necessarily like full exposure to the chain portfolio. This prevents the agreement from attracting higher-quality fund managers and a larger number of DeFi users.\n\nHow to bridge the boundaries between privacy and initiative is important. Instant redemption, users’ rights to portfolio assets and the empowerment of managers’ equity are also important. From this point of view, investment kols with their own community attributes tend to be the priority of decentralized asset management protocols, while social tokens and NFT have obvious advantages in increasing tool availability and user asset flow.\n\n## Enzyme: Eliminate capital waste and welcome social return\n\n### 1/Integrate protocols and portfolio assets to improve capital efficiency\n\nEnzyme is a modification of Melon Protocol. They released version V4 this year, which has a lot of innovation beyond basic features like decentralized lending, AMM pools, and agricultural capabilities. Fund managers have access to a large number of functions outside the protocol. This protocol integrates Polygon, Uniswap V3, Opyn, Compound, Aave and other protocols.\n\nAt the same time, Gas Relayer’s new features allow asset managers to eliminate the high ethereum Gas fee burden and redefine the cost of the entire vault. To fully understand how this works, as well as its implications and best practices, we will soon be Posting a blog covering this.\n\nV4 allows users to customize the token/ticker symbol and customize around the user’s brand identity. Users can also transfer shares to new investors without redemption. This creates a secondary market for the user’s Treasury stock, which gives it the opportunity to trade. Users can invest in more than 200 assets here. The platform also enables organizations to run their own investment funds using Gnosis multi-signature wallets.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*MlO7nAiNukplj6sA)\n\n*source: Enzyme*\n\nEnzyme solves the problem of capital inefficiencies by integrating deployment with multiple protocols. Increase the availability of the agreement by borrowing and escrow assets. So Enzyme is definitely on the move when it comes to making broader gains. The allocation and use of idle assets to obtain immediate income increases the source of liquidity and income options. Better use of idle assets and LP tokens is an important reason why Enzyme is ahead.\n\n### 2/The key to winning: Personalized social investing trends\n\nEnzyme’s own Treasury creates a personalized vault, while users can easily copy on-chain policies. These designs greatly enhance users’ social security and freedom. Enzyme also improves security and depositor protection through a 7-day review period.\n\nV4 introduced a protocol fee for this protocol. The fee is a tax on the amount of assets under management in each vault. This is calculated continuously with respect to the annualized target percentage and results in the automatic casting of a certain number of additional shares for each vault and allocation to the agreement itself. The agreement uses a repo mechanism to force fund managers to demand MLN tokens. In addition, the burning of the MLN used for buybacks creates deflationary pressures on tokens.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*H6fCbtAAozyf-AQX)\n\n*source: DefiLlama*\n\nIn traditional finance, investing in hedge funds can be difficult for the average person. Launching hedge funds could be harder. Enzyme simplified and innovated the fund launch process, and the openness of the network they built in addition to improving transparency, democratized access for all investors. After years of development, Enzyme’s TVL hovers around $30 million.\n\nWe think Enzyme should pursue more social attempts to monetize smart elitist investment management. For investors, Enzyme lowers barriers to entry and improves transparency. As long as the Enzyme protocol continues to integrate and expand the scope of assets and focus on optimizing the long-term direction of composable financial instruments, the investability of assets across the chain will continue to increase.\n\nEven during bear markets, asset management protocols should consider a profit strategy on the downside. Fund managers can hold stablecoin assets and avoid the downward trend in profits. On this basis, how to create more investment options for users in a falling market is the problem to consider. For the two core stakeholders, it is only a matter of time before AUM rises in the future, as long as their enthusiasm can be stimulated.", "timestamp": 1656083116, "digest": "2a0GYBhiBG9Wp85mV0UVSxBJ9OZwaFDa5vvOopTZe04", "contributor": "0x867A3f354c0eCB6622aEf1bF14C3BE79338AD889"}

Asset prices globally are down and inflation is up. Some DAOs, such as [1Hive](https://twitter.com/Paul_Glavin/status/1537824747714748416), were able to utilize diversification strategies during the peak of last cycle to convert their native tokens to stable coins, to build up that emergency runway, but most did not. It has never been more apparent of how important diversification is. It may seem like there is nothing left to do, because selling tokens at these prices may only further exacerbate the problems and put additional sell pressure on token prices, especially when buyers are becoming more scarce until things settle down. However, I believe there is still one great option to deploy native DAO tokens to earn yield and responsibly convert them to stable coins: long dated covered calls.\n\n**Background**: Hedgey Finance launched the ability for any DAO to deploy a covered calls market (pair of token <> usdc), across any EVM. Covered Calls are derivatives, commonly referred to as Options, where the *Seller* of the call is *Selling (and receiving payment for)* the *Right* (for the *Buyer*) to purchase *X* amount of *Tokens* at a specific *Price per token* before a specific *Date*. Simply what this means is that as the seller, I am getting paid up front in USDC, and locking my native tokens in the DeFi protocol where the buyer can purchase those tokens from me at our agreed upon price anytime before the expiration date. When the buyer buys my tokens, referred to as ‘exercising the call’, they pay me  the agreed upon USDC to purchase the tokens. If the call expires (doesn’t get exercised before the expiration date), then I just get my tokens back and can deploy and sell another covered call.\n\nWhile traders may think of covered calls as a strictly day trading strategy, for the DAO<>community relationship, they can be a very powerful tool that does not require constant trading. Rather than a short term speculative toy, selling 3 - 6 month (or longer) dated covered calls has the power to align benefits and incentives of a DAO and its community.\n\n**Good for the DAO:** DAOs would be selling covered calls to 1) earn some yield in USDC on their native tokens today and 2) responsibly and transparently convert those tokens to USDC at a higher price than current market prices at some point in the future. This strategy does a lot of things:\n\n* Creates immediate stable coin liquidity\n* Transparently and responsibly converts tokens to stable coins as price appreciates - at publicly known price levels\n* When converted, builds a real runway of stable coins, generating true diversification of the treasury\n* Builds trust with the community and investors, while also giving them the opportunity to profit\n\n**Good for the community:** On the flip side are the buyers of the covered calls offered by the DAO - the community (and other investors). While many have seen their portfolios suffer recently, buying long dated covered calls is a way for the community to pay significantly less up front to get significantly more leverage on the token appreciation in the future. As an example, lets suppose we are interested in buying 100 of token X, currently priced at $5. We can purchase those tokens for $500. Alternatively, if DAO_X is selling a covered call of 100 tokens, with a strike of $7.5 and premium of $50 we could purchase that instead at 1/10th of the cost. Without getting into the weeds, if the price of X goes to $10, then we’ll have gained 100% on the Hodl strategy but 200% on the options strategy, and if it goes to $15: 200% on the Hodl strategy but a whopping 1,400% on the options strategy. As prices have dropped so swiftly, this is a great opportunity to purchase at a discount - and buying long dated covered call options will render even more opportunity for gains when the next bull market hits.\n\n**Summary: Hedgey’s peer to peer long dated covered call options are an effective tool to build stablecoin runway in a bear market.** Buyers should have the appetite to take advantage of depressed token prices, and purchasing covered calls gives them an even higher upside profit potential. DAOs can utilize the covered calls to generate some runway up front, and responsibly let the community buy tokens at given price points above current market prices (ie no dumping).\n\n*If you are interested as a DAO or community, but need help in understanding how to price the covered calls reasonably and fairly, please join our [discord](https://discord.gg/2wG5jGsBRw) and reach out to @iceman (or @icemanparachute on telegram).*\n\nDisclaimer: This the articles and materials on this site are not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for, financial advise or legal or tax advice, or investment recommendations.

In terms of the question of whether BTC is inflationary or deflationary, some people will say it’s inflationary as there are still 2 million more BTC to be mined, however, there is a max supply cap of 21 million, so in essence, it is actually deflationary as the available supply will be less since miners will be obsolete due to no more BTC available to be mined so the only way to acquire more would be to trade.\n* In terms of utility, BTC has been described as many things, those include a store of value, an alternative to gold; ie. digital gold, it can be used for fast, cheap and permissionless transactions and in terms of resilience it’s proven over time to be a very strong and secure network.\n* Is there a real-world use case?\n  * Store of value, some people have referred to BTC as gold.2 or digital gold\n  * Hedge on inflation, since there is a limited supply\n  * Transactions, fast, cheap & permissionless\n* Who are the whales (who owns the majority of tokens)?\n* Is the distribution spread out or concentrated?\n  * Due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of BTC, it’s difficult to work out how much one entity or person holds, as these can be shared across different wallets.\n  * However, according to [BitInfoCharts](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html), we can firstly see that some of these large holders are cold wallets for large exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, Coincheck, Bittrex, ect.\n  * We can also see that the top 100 wallets hold around 15% of all BTC.\n  * Also we have to take into consideration that larger institutions such as MassMutual, Ruffer Investments, Tesla, GrayScale Bitcoin Trust and Microstrategy to name a few are accumulating more BTC as we speak.\n  * *We should also assume that other financial institutions are moving into the space such as the large banks who thrive from market manipulation, so as they FUD the space, be sure they’re slowly buying.*\n\n## ETH Ξ\n\n* There are 121 million ETH in circulation, there is an infinite ∞ amount of ETH available to be added, so there is no max cap. Similar to BTC, at face value, it seems that ETH is inflationary as there is no max supply cap so an infinite amount could be issued. However thanks to [EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md), ETH has introduced a burning mechanism (ETH being sent to a wallet that no one has access to, therefore removing it from circulation) the asset becomes deflationary as eventually more ETH will be burnt than is issued once the merge happens in 2050 *(a running joke that the merge will forever be in development)*. Using [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money/) you can track the burn, supply growth and issuance and even simulate the issuance (creation/release of new ETH into circulating supply) which as you’ll see ends up being negative so therefore deflationary.\n* In terms of utility, there are several for holding the ETH token & using the Ethereum network:\n  * Transactions, transactions are permissionless\n  * Store of value, with the burning of ETH there is a decreasing supply so you can assume the value would only increase due to scarcity\n  * Staking, you can contribute to the network security & earn rewards for that contribution and time\n    * This staking causes a strong network effect which gives high security due to the size of the network and also high costs to transact meaning an attack large enough or multiple attacks to the network would be incredibly costly without certainty of success.\n  * Build on top of the platform, builders can develop & grow different decentralised applications from DEFI, NFT’s an a bunch of  dapps (decentralised apps) & smart contracts\n* In terms of real-world use case, here are some:\n  * Similar to BTC it’s a store of value, as the supply decreases the scarcity increases so it’s deflationary\n  * Transactions, these are permissionless\n  * People can access these financial tools across DEFI with a level playing field as a pose to the current financial system which allows ~~rich people~~ and accredited investors to access exclusive money-making opportunities\n  * DEFI allows for higher interest rate returns via staking, farming, instant trading and leverage, which obviously has risks but the fact that you can decide for yourself instead of being told yes/no by some obscure person/group is a positive step.\n  * Possibilities for people to make an income from gaming without being sponsored by big organisations with p2e (play to earn)\n  * Jump into the art world which is usually quite exclusive and seen as very exclusive, now there’s an easier way via NFT’s which also offer opportunities to join membership clubs, investment opportunities, the possibilities are endless.\n  * DAO’s, which are decentralised autonomous organisations, as the name states they’re decentralised (or at least they’re meant to be, that in itself is another whole topic), where a group can be created by friends, colleagues or complete strangers with a shared goal/s in mind where people can enter by simply owning x-amount of the DAO’s token, decisions are made via proposals & voting of the members and these can range from rules, roadmap/plans, managing money in the treasury, ect.\n* Who are the whales (who owns the majority of tokens)?\n* Is the distribution spread out or concentrated?\n  * Similar to BTC, due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of crypto, it’s difficult to map out wallets vs. owners.\n  * Also similar to BTC, there are large institutions that are accumulating ETH as an asset class to add to their balance sheets.\n  * Good to mention that ETH launched with an ICO, meaning that early investors were able to buy a large amount for the price $0.31 per coin, in total around 50 million ETHs were sold at a price raising over $16 million.\n  * Vitalik, being the co-founder is the largest ETH whale, currently holding 290k ETH in his [wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x220866b1a2219f40e72f5c628b65d54268ca3a9d/), however, compared to the circulating supply of 121 million, it’s around 0.24% of the circulating supply.\n  * You can see that the top [100 wallets](https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/ethereum/richlist/) hold around 39% of all circulating supply, which is a lot, again most are exchanges with a large 10% held by the ETH 2 Deposit Contract, where validators have locked up their funds.\n  * Many of the top 100 ETH addresses are exchange & DEFI protocols which include Bitfinex, Okex, FTX, Polkadot Multi-Sig, Arbitrum’s bridge, and Lido.\n\n## All that is great, but it comes down to your own situation which includes:\n\n* Financial stability\n* Short/medium/long term goals\n* Risk appetite\n* Exit strategy\n\nSo, most of the time these questions of “Should I invest/buy XYZ Token?\"The truthful answer is & always will be, it depends…\n\n![Dr. Who](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tJz9zEG0U_WvOqbdyx4bl.png?height=1332&width=1326)\n\nDo your research, live on & hopefully prosper ✌️", "timestamp": 1656083238, "digest": "sLQkSIs3AG31UFLEiXTWSXK3L_XgN-cySL1opK_eVgM", "contributor": "0xd40C1F4242D17023Fa4894812Ee7563124b27C66"}
{"id": "_ynMUHoluU7g8mfqlTd4tAD6QtiISfOxwbiQ3ADfDII", "title": "Using Covered Calls to build runway in a bear market", "body": "### TLDR: DAOs can take advantage of low asset prices to sell covered calls to their community as a win-win way for the DAO to earn up front yield on tokens in USDC, transparently and responsibly convert tokens at scale to USDC, and allow communities to profit from future token appreciation in excess of hodling.\n\nWeb3 and DAO treasuries have taken a substantial hit in recent weeks. Asset prices globally are down and inflation is up. Some DAOs, such as [1Hive](https://twitter.com/Paul_Glavin/status/1537824747714748416), were able to utilize diversification strategies during the peak of last cycle to convert their native tokens to stable coins, to build up that emergency runway, but most did not. It has never been more apparent of how important diversification is. It may seem like there is nothing left to do, because selling tokens at these prices may only further exacerbate the problems and put additional sell pressure on token prices, especially when buyers are becoming more scarce until things settle down. However, I believe there is still one great option to deploy native DAO tokens to earn yield and responsibly convert them to stable coins: long dated covered calls.\n\n**Background**: Hedgey Finance launched the ability for any DAO to deploy a covered calls market (pair of token <> usdc), across any EVM. Covered Calls are derivatives, commonly referred to as Options, where the *Seller* of the call is *Selling (and receiving payment for)* the *Right* (for the *Buyer*) to purchase *X* amount of *Tokens* at a specific *Price per token* before a specific *Date*. Simply what this means is that as the seller, I am getting paid up front in USDC, and locking my native tokens in the DeFi protocol where the buyer can purchase those tokens from me at our agreed upon price anytime before the expiration date. When the buyer buys my tokens, referred to as ‘exercising the call’, they pay me  the agreed upon USDC to purchase the tokens. If the call expires (doesn’t get exercised before the expiration date), then I just get my tokens back and can deploy and sell another covered call.\n\nWhile traders may think of covered calls as a strictly day trading strategy, for the DAO<>community relationship, they can be a very powerful tool that does not require constant trading. Rather than a short term speculative toy, selling 3 - 6 month (or longer) dated covered calls has the power to align benefits and incentives of a DAO and its community.\n\n**Good for the DAO:** DAOs would be selling covered calls to 1) earn some yield in USDC on their native tokens today and 2) responsibly and transparently convert those tokens to USDC at a higher price than current market prices at some point in the future. This strategy does a lot of things:\n\n* Creates immediate stable coin liquidity\n* Transparently and responsibly converts tokens to stable coins as price appreciates - at publicly known price levels\n* When converted, builds a real runway of stable coins, generating true diversification of the treasury\n* Builds trust with the community and investors, while also giving them the opportunity to profit\n\n**Good for the community:** On the flip side are the buyers of the covered calls offered by the DAO - the community (and other investors). While many have seen their portfolios suffer recently, buying long dated covered calls is a way for the community to pay significantly less up front to get significantly more leverage on the token appreciation in the future. As an example, lets suppose we are interested in buying 100 of token X, currently priced at $5. We can purchase those tokens for $500. Alternatively, if DAO_X is selling a covered call of 100 tokens, with a strike of $7.5 and premium of $50 we could purchase that instead at 1/10th of the cost. Without getting into the weeds, if the price of X goes to $10, then we’ll have gained 100% on the Hodl strategy but 200% on the options strategy, and if it goes to $15: 200% on the Hodl strategy but a whopping 1,400% on the options strategy. As prices have dropped so swiftly, this is a great opportunity to purchase at a discount - and buying long dated covered call options will render even more opportunity for gains when the next bull market hits.\n\n**Summary: Hedgey’s peer to peer long dated covered call options are an effective tool to build stablecoin runway in a bear market.** Buyers should have the appetite to take advantage of depressed token prices, and purchasing covered calls gives them an even higher upside profit potential. DAOs can utilize the covered calls to generate some runway up front, and responsibly let the community buy tokens at given price points above current market prices (ie no dumping).\n\n*If you are interested as a DAO or community, but need help in understanding how to price the covered calls reasonably and fairly, please join our [discord](https://discord.gg/2wG5jGsBRw) and reach out to @iceman (or @icemanparachute on telegram).*\n\nDisclaimer: This the articles and materials on this site are not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for, financial advise or legal or tax advice, or investment recommendations.

{"id": "4WT_JfV1dkUgknNvi6FY0zxnqSEhcRKp029eq_G1qvY", "title": "The \"crypto\" in cryptocurrency", "body": "The word “crypto” may spark images in your mind of ciphers, code breaking and even Bletchley park’s involvement in World War 2. I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). From his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. The idea that information wants to find its way into every nook and cranny does have consequences (for the better or worse). For example, information leaks can help us learn about atrocities committed by government, but it can also be used by the government for surveillance of its citizens. \n\nCryptography is a tool that enables us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. It has similarities to the perspective of David vs Goliath as cryptography is one of the only tools that allows a citizen to successfully fend against a nation state actor. In fact, for most of cryptography’s history, it is a tool that allows the defender to protect itself from an all-powerful adversary. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA protocol designed using cryptography tends to have three goals: \n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is not concerned with confidentiality. It is only focused on integrity and authentication. Both goals form the backbone for decentralization as it allows anyone to verify: \n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nPut another way, decentralization relies on a property called public verifiability. This property allows anyone to fetch data from an untrusted source and independently check if the relevant computation (and data) is correct. Applied to cryptocurrency, it allows a network of users to continuously check the blockchain’s integrity and ultimately protect our assets represented in the database. \n\nIf a user cannot get access to the data, or if the cryptography did not exist, then we must blindly trust an authority to protect the system -- essentially how the legacy financial system works today. \n\n## Twitter for your bank account\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\nMany people find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange at first. I suspect this is the case because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use in the dark web. The very name *crypto*currency leads to that misunderstanding. Unfortunately for criminals, they are the most traceable currencies in the world and it is a really bad tool for their desired purpose. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose.\n\nConfidentiality of financial transactions on a global scale is a sought-after feature. A number of systems exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. is a sought-after property and there are a number of systems with strong confidentiality including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. I believe this frontier of research and development is essential for the continued growth of decentralised finance (DeFi).\n\nA fun project is to list the existing DeFI applications and identify which aspects can benefit from financial privacy. But for now, we do not concern ourselves with confidentiality. It is not needed to understand how cryptography is immediately used in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThe cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is basic. There are only two primitives to consider. A commitment scheme to protect the integrity of the blockchain and digital signatures to authenticate actions from an end-user. We have put together dedicated articles for both primitives and in this article we provide a brief explanation of each.\n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature. A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity. They can compute the credentials (public-private key pair) locally on their machine. The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer. A signature is timeless and it can be verified at any point in time.

(Die Teilnahme an der InfoWalk ist nicht verpflichtend aber ich kann’s nur empfehlen, damit du dann bei Treffpunkten nicht so lost bist :p).\n\n**Ab 16:15 Uhr** kannst du langsam an den **Pool** kommen und Platz nehmen für die Info-Veranstaltung. **Die Teilnahme ist** im Gegensatz zur InfoWalk **für alle verpflichtend**, da wir euch sehr wichtige Sachen mitteilen müssen :)\n\n**Im Abschluss** (ggf. nach Absprache etwas später) **geht’s direkt weiter mit deinem Meeting**; da lernst du dein/e TeamerIn und den Rest deines Meeting kennen und werden dir ein paar andere Sachen erklärt.

{"id": "o8k5QLVlZw48PViaIcj1zAExHUF9EK0ZVNAgxWMG3wE", "title": "How did I Save 70000 ETH and Win 6 Millon Bug Bounty", "body": "Hi! I am [pwning.eth](https://twitter.com/PwningEth), a wanderer in the hacking space who has recently jumped into the wonderland of crypto. A few months ago, I reported a critical bug in the Aurora Engine, a layer 2 EVM solution built on the NEAR protocol. At least 70000 ETH were at risk of being stolen, until I found the tricky vulnerability and helped the Aurora team fix it. It would be in the [top 5](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/) heists in the defi history, if the 200 million tokens were taken over by a blackhat hacker. In the end, I won a bug bounty of 6 million, which was the second highest bounty in history.\n\nI am an experienced whitehat hacker from the web2 world. I have been watching the hacking drama in the crypto world for a while, and there is so much randomness! I am not too surprised at the astronomical profits of defi hackers, because the criminals in the real world also make an insane amount of money. However, I was really shocked by the [story](https://www.saurik.com/optimism.html) of saurik, a famous hacker in the jailbreak community. The size of his bug bounty is unheard of in the traditional security world, and so I can’t wait to start my own treasure hunt in web3.\n\nI started by checking the bounty list on Immunefi. The Aurora bounty program, listed on the very top of the website due to its huge bounty offer, caught my eye. It was a novel project built by a group of talented engineers, which suggested that it might be complex enough to be immune to common defi hackers and mysterious enough for me to learn something magical. Thanks to my experiences in hacking modern complex systems, I was able to start my research on the new blockchains quickly. I had reviewed the Aurora bridge, which was a solid project. Then I moved on to the Aurora engine and discovered the unicorn bug in a few hours. Unlike ordinary defi vulnerabilities, I didn't think this bug could be identified by random people as fast or lucky as me, so I took my time verifying and reproducing the bug in case it was a false alarm. It took me a few days to learn, build, learn, test and finally finish the report.\n\nI tried pinging the Aurora team in discord, sending messages to the official bounty email and submitting the issue through Immunefi. They confirmed and patched the vulnerability quickly, and have since recounted the general [story](https://aurora.dev/blog/aurora-mitigates-its-inflation-vulnerability). Their rewards for smart contract critical vulnerabilities are calculated as 10% of potential economic damage of their exploitation, up to a value of $6,000,000 USD. In this case, the potential damage could have been higher than ten times this maximum reward. Therefore I was eligible to receive the maximum possible amount, the total value of $6,000,000 USD, in the form of locked AURORA tokens. It’s a pretty smart and lucky move to be listed on Immunefi :)\n\nThe [technical details](https://medium.com/immunefi/aurora-infinite-spend-bugfix-review-6m-payout-e635d24273d) have been explained by Immunefi. Here is my short summary:\n\n1. The Aurora engine implements token bridging in prebuilt contracts at hardcoded addresses. They are the magical bridges connecting Ethereum, NEAR and Aurora. \n2. The vulnerable contract always emits a fixed address in bridging events, assuming the `msg.value` will be collected by itself. However, if the contract is invoked by `delegatecall()`, the `msg.value` will never be sent to the contract but the log will be emitted as usual.\n   \n3. By repeating the malicious withdrawal then redeposit process, the attacker can double their balance exponentially.

I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). From his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. The idea that information wants to find its way into every nook and cranny does have consequences (for the better or worse). For example, information leaks can help us learn about atrocities committed by government, but it can also be used by the government for surveillance of its citizens. \n\nCryptography is a tool that enables us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. It has similarities to the perspective of David vs Goliath as cryptography is one of the only tools that allows a citizen to successfully fend against a nation state actor. In fact, for most of cryptography’s history, it is a tool that allows the defender to protect itself from an all-powerful adversary. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA protocol designed using cryptography tends to have three goals: \n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is not concerned with confidentiality. It is only focused on integrity and authentication. Both goals form the backbone for decentralization as it allows anyone to verify: \n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nPut another way, decentralization relies on a property called public verifiability. This property allows anyone to fetch data from an untrusted source and independently check if the relevant computation (and data) is correct. Applied to cryptocurrency, it allows a network of users to continuously check the blockchain’s integrity and ultimately protect our assets represented in the database. \n\nIf a user cannot get access to the data, or if the cryptography did not exist, then we must blindly trust an authority to protect the system -- essentially how the legacy financial system works today. \n\n## Twitter for your bank account\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\nNewcomers find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange. Very often, this is because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use on the dark web to buy drugs. The very name, -crypto-currency, can help lead to that misunderstanding. \n\nUnfortunately for criminals, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most traceable currencies in the world. It is a really bad tool for their desired purpose as the historical transactions are replicated across the world and kept forever. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose. \n\nIn fact, even for crime that originates on the network, there are some fun examples to consider:\n\n* **Bitfinex hacker**. The FBI helped recover [over 94k BTC](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency) from the hacker on behalf of Bitfinex. In typical crypto fashion, the hacker was an amateur rapper called [“Razzlekhan”](https://cointelegraph.com/news/comedic-rapper-charged-with-involvement-in-bitfinex-hack-out-on-bail) and a [sophisticated social engineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/agedlikemilk/comments/sskkj6/heather_morgan_giving_a_presentation_on_social/) attacker. They got caught after trying to cash out a small portion of the stolen bitcoins.  \n* **OpenSea insider trading.** A twitter user found credible evidence, using transactions in the blockchain, that a product manager at OpenSea were buying NFTs before they were announced on the homepage (and then sold for a premium). The [SEC will use this evidence](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-117) for proceedings against the ex-employee. \n* **MtGox repeatedly hacked.** The exchange was responsible for loosing around \\~6% of all Bitcoin. An investigation by WizSec, [using blockchain data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l70iRcSxqzo&ab_channel=TheBitcoinArmy), found credible evidence that the exchange was not solvent for a long time. \n\nConfidentiality of financial transactions on a global scale is a sought-after feature. A number of systems exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. is a sought-after property and there are a number of systems with strong confidentiality including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. I believe this frontier of research and development is essential for the continued growth of decentralised finance (DeFi).\n\nA fun project is to list the existing DeFI applications and identify which aspects can benefit from financial privacy. But for now, we do not concern ourselves with confidentiality. It is not needed to understand how cryptography is immediately used in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThe cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is basic. There are only two primitives to consider. A commitment scheme to protect the integrity of the blockchain and digital signatures to authenticate actions from an end-user. We have put together dedicated articles for both primitives and in this article we provide a brief explanation of each.\n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature. A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity. They can compute the credentials (public-private key pair) locally on their machine. The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer. A signature is timeless and it can be verified at any point in time. In fact, we can check all historical transactions in a network like Bitcoin and verify the signer was indeed authorised to spend the coins.\n\nWhat about zero knowledge proofs?", "timestamp": 1656085660, "digest": "a4Y0TrLL7BcS8rarDfDVQW6HJKSTydm5K7u2sEqC2wA", "contributor": "0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5"}

I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). From his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. The idea that information wants to find its way into every nook and cranny does have consequences (for the better or worse). For example, information leaks can help us learn about atrocities committed by government, but it can also be used by the government for surveillance of its citizens. \n\nCryptography is a tool that enables us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. It has similarities to the perspective of David vs Goliath as cryptography is one of the only tools that allows a citizen to successfully fend against a nation state actor. In fact, for most of cryptography’s history, it is a tool that allows the defender to protect itself from an all-powerful adversary. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA protocol designed using cryptography tends to have three goals: \n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is not concerned with confidentiality. It is only focused on integrity and authentication. Both goals form the backbone for decentralization as it allows anyone to verify: \n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nPut another way, decentralization relies on a property called public verifiability. This property allows anyone to fetch data from an untrusted source and independently check if the relevant computation (and data) is correct. Applied to cryptocurrency, it allows a network of users to continuously check the blockchain’s integrity and ultimately protect our assets represented in the database. \n\nIf a user cannot get access to the data, or if the cryptography did not exist, then we must blindly trust an authority to protect the system -- essentially how the legacy financial system works today. \n\n## Twitter for your bank account\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\nNewcomers find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange. Very often, this is because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use on the dark web to buy drugs. The very name, -crypto-currency, can help lead to that misunderstanding. \n\nUnfortunately for criminals, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most traceable currencies in the world. It is a really bad tool for their desired purpose as the historical transactions are replicated across the world and kept forever. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose. \n\nIn fact, even for crime that originates on the network, there are some fun examples to consider:\n\n* **Bitfinex hacker**. The FBI helped recover [over 94k BTC](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency) from the hacker on behalf of Bitfinex. In typical crypto fashion, the hacker was an amateur rapper called [“Razzlekhan”](https://cointelegraph.com/news/comedic-rapper-charged-with-involvement-in-bitfinex-hack-out-on-bail) and a [sophisticated social engineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/agedlikemilk/comments/sskkj6/heather_morgan_giving_a_presentation_on_social/) attacker. They got caught after trying to cash out a small portion of the stolen bitcoins.  \n* **OpenSea insider trading.** A twitter user found credible evidence, using transactions in the blockchain, that a product manager at OpenSea were buying NFTs before they were announced on the homepage (and then sold for a premium). The [SEC will use this evidence](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-117) for proceedings against the ex-employee. \n* **MtGox repeatedly hacked.** The exchange was responsible for loosing around \\~6% of all Bitcoin. An investigation by WizSec, [using blockchain data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l70iRcSxqzo&ab_channel=TheBitcoinArmy), found credible evidence that the exchange was not solvent for a long time. \n\nWhile the lack of confidentiality has helped the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the eyes of regulators and law enforcement, confidentiality is still a sought-after feature to protect the right of users to transact. A number of cryptocurrency networks exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees for transferring assets including ZCash, Aztec Protocol and Monero. The new frontier of research and development is focused on building smart contract platforms that support confidentiality for some aspects of the application.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThe cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is basic and there are only two primitives to consider: \n\n* A commitment scheme to protect the integrity of the blockchain.\n* A digital signature scheme to  authenticate actions from an end-user. \n\nIn the following, we have put together a dedicated article for each primitive alongside a brief explanation. \n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature. A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity.

The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer.

Even inside of the grueling hours of crafting experiences, launching Discord servers (and the games within them), noodling and nitpicking over content and messaging, for the most part, we’re playing with fiction to create transformative experiences. And that’s important -- because that’s what we want everyone who joins the Lost Children universe to do. Play with fiction to create their own transformative experiences.\n\nThis launch represents one of the most exciting periods of my 29-year journey writing the Lost Children of Andromeda story. At first, I thought it was because my dream of bringing this world to life in a new and exciting way was finally coming true.

{"id": "ooAUTCz9e0sh2kW9aBVwsOBZHQTS2b7YTTeLrlGUhMI", "title": "The NFT Liquidity Problem", "body": "NFTs can be hard to sell. Not because you've developed an emotional attachment to your Ether Rock, although I don't blame you — but because there's a finite amount of people who can either (1) afford your rock, or (2) who want to buy your rock.\n\nAnd this challenge extends to the entire NFT market, which, while growing fast, is still small compared to the market for fungible tokens or for traditional equities. This challenge — where we can't buy/sell things when we want — can be reframed as the \"liquidity problem.\"\n\n## What is liquidity?\n\nIn short, it is the degree to which an asset can be quickly purchased or sold at a price reflecting its current value. In other words, a market is liquid if you can sell your asset when you want without taking a material loss.\n\n## How do you improve liquidity?\n\nAs you add more participants (i.e., new money) to a market, liquidity generally improves. This is because the more people you have in the market, the easier it is to enter/exit your position. But adding participants isn't easy when there's limited liquidity. If I can't easily buy/sell an asset whenever I want, I might avoid the NFT market entirely because there's a higher degree of risk relative to other more-liquid investments.\n\nAnd here we find ourselves in a Catch 22. To add participants, you need liquidity, but to add liquidity you need participants. So how do we get ourselves out of this mess? How do we create liquidity without adding more users?\n\nLuckily for us, there are few solutions out there already, and we are going to explore the following:\n\n* **Fractionalization:** Increase asset accessibility (i.e., more people can afford your rock)\n* **Bonding Curve Contracts:** increase asset transferability (i.e., more \"people\" want to buy your rock)\n\n## Fractionalization\n\nIn the beginning of this article I defined the problem in two parts. Fractionalization solves part one, or \"there's a finite amount of people who can afford your rock.\" NFT fractionalization is the act of dividing the ownership of an NFT into smaller fractions.\n\nYou can fractionalize an NFT by locking it in a smart contract (also called a vault) and then auctioning off ERC20 tokens that represent ownership of the locked NFT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wG7UJIYeXBm83_nRtpzc_.png?height=554&width=1249)\n\n### Fractionalizing our Ether Rock\n\nSo how does it work? If we were using something like fractional.art, we would first initiate an auction on our Rock and sell 10,000 ERC20 tokens (which we can label PEBBLEs). These PEBBLEs represent a claim on our Rock. Together, the PEBBLE holders determine a price they are willing to sell the entire Ether Rock NFT (this is called the reserve price). If a whale comes along and wants to buy the Rock in its entirety, he/she needs to pay the reserve price in ETH. Once paid, the PEBBLE token holders can now redeem their PEBBLEs for the reserve price paid in ETH — completing the \"buyout.\" Now the whale owns the Rock and the PEBBLE holders (who traded in their PEBBLEs) own the ETH.\n\nFor the owner, fractionalizing facilitates efficient price discovery and reduces volatility. But more importantly, it improves the accessibility of NFTs. It provides people priced out of expensive assets, exposure. This means you don't have to wait for the right whale to come along to buy your Ether Rock, instead, you can fractionalize ownership across thousands of people, who have always wanted to be an Ether Rock owner.\n\n## Bonding Curve Contracts\n\nOk, so we made the Rock more accessible, and that's great! But how do we solve part 2? How do we find more people who want to buy our NFTs? Turns out, there is something that can help us, and it's called a bonding curve contract.\n\nBonding curves are smart contracts where you can not only buy a token, but you can sell it back at any point in time. To make this work, a bonding curve does two things:\n\n1. It automatically adjusts the token price based on the quantity of tokens outstanding. In most cases, this means that the more tokens are distributed, the more expensive the remaining tokens will be.\n2. It retains the funds used to purchase the tokens and uses these funds to buy back a seller's tokens.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cJtQXtcV-THGJy24cIfuC.png?height=682&width=1212)\n\n### Bonding our Ether Rock\n\nLet's say a bonding curve contract holds 100 Ether Rocks and it is configured so the price increases 5% (from the initial price) with each NFT sold. If the initial price is set at $10, the first Rock would sell for $10, the 5th Rock would sell for $12, and the 100th Rock would sell for $59.50. If you were to buy the 5th Rock, and 95 others were subsequently purchased, you would then be in a position to sell your Rock at the price of the most recent purchase — which in this case is $59.50 (netting you a $47.59 profit) — and moving the current price down one notch on the curve to $59.\n\nWith a bonding contract, we don't need to auction our Ether Rock on a secondary market when we want to sell. We can just resell it back to the contract at price calculated by the bonding curve.\n\nWith a bonding curve, we now have a way to sell back our Ether Rock. It might not be at the price we originally paid, but it gives us security and at least partial liquidity that isn't guaranteed in the secondary market. Beyond that, it ensures we can price assets in a transparent, predictable, and immutable fashion.\n\n## Tying It All Together\n\nFractionalization and bonding contracts offer new ways to address the liquidity problem without introducing more participants (and new money) into the market.\n\nThey can also be stacked together in interesting ways. Imagine you own an NFT that collects royalties from a song. You could lock this NFT into a bonding contract and mint new ERC20 tokens that represent rights to these royalties. This is, in a way, fractionalizing an NFT to extend ownership across a wider audience. And this isn’t just some thought experiment — founders are starting to explore these concepts to improve how they price and distribute assets to investors. In fact, the founders of [Decent](https://twitter.com/decentxyz?lang=en), a decentralized music label, actually discussed this very thing on the [BlockCrunch podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0q7blbSQ8EJljH8raK6wrg?si=cac71f26e35548b7). And Paul Kolhass, the founder of [Molecule](https://twitter.com/molecule_dao), [considered using this model ](https://tokeneconomy.co/token-bonding-curves-in-practice-3eb904720cb8)to improve the discovery, exchange, and development of intellectual property in the pharmaceutical space.", "timestamp": 1656086563, "digest": "me3fs6F1fiFjix09qCl2ONr3hemopSPtrej401odScA", "contributor": "0xf15c734681f9B950e6559aB5Fe200FCe80539A80"}

{"id": "UQ7IX8cKjbKDTUhHJUijxMbxhcNiT1V2FfvVdhfff6E", "title": "I Can't Train Like I Did Before!", "body": "## TOM’S TIPS NUMBER 2\n\n**Today is time for Tip number 2. I'm sharing a tip every fortnight for as long as I have tips to share ;-) \n **\n\nToday's tip is more of a mindset shift than a tangible nutrition/fitness tip, and it is particularly relevant to those of you stepping into your 40’s and beyond. \n\nIf you are not in those years yet, then great stuff, but thinking about this philosophy ahead of time will serve you well.\n\nIt only occurred to me the other day when in the gym.** \n **\n\nI Can't Train Like I Did Before!\n\nI don’t know about you but the hardest person on myself is..... myself! No one can beat me up as well as I do myself on occasion. I am so good at times that I usually don’t even notice I am doing it. \n\nThe little digs and untruths we tell ourselves here and there, chipping bits of confidence off of us, while we're totally unaware that this process is even going on.\n\nThe good news is that once we do become aware of it, we can take steps to counter it and actually boost ourselves up! But becoming aware of it is the key! \n\n** \n **\n\nOne of the internal chipping aways that is relevant to this article and fitness is I’ll say, “I can't train like I used to before!” \n\nIn my head, this is seen as negative, and I have been saying it a lot over recent years, it seems. Now I get close to fifty years old, the volume of the critical side my internal chimp has been creeping up slowly but surely!\n\nIt was only when I caught my subconscious saying it the other day that I took the time to think about it! Whenever we say something to others or even ourselves, we can become self-fulfilling prophecies. \n\nIt’s like the classic line where you are told to clear your mind and then to absolutely, under no condition, do not think of a pink elephant. \n\nWhat is the first thing you are thinking about? \n\nYep it’s the pink elephant.\n\nWe make statements all day which can inadvertently help or hinder us.\n\nBack to my statement of me not training like I did before. ** \n **\n\nCan I train as heavy as I used to? Nope, I cannot. \n\nCan I train as hard as I used to? Nope, I cannot . \n\nAm I as fast as I used to be? Nope, I am not, and I have had a few injuries along the way for good measure, which really helps my statement.\n\nHowever, is it possible that with work, I could turn this all around? The answer is yes! It’s unlikely, but it is possible! \n\nSo in reality, the statement in each case should not be, “Nope, I cannot”. It should be “I cannot right now, but I could!”\n\nHowever, what does this really matter? \n\nAm I training and using my body? Yes, I am!\n\nAm I using weights which challenge me and am I using enough training volume to get an effect? Yes, I am. \n\nAm I training smarter than I ever did in my twenties and thirties due to a much better understanding of my body and how it operates? Without a doubt, the answer here is a big yes too!\n\nThe key is to make sure we respect and appreciate the body we live in and make the most of its potential, whatever our age!  And to watch our self-talk.\n\nThis is Tom's Tip #2.\n\nI repeat: ** \n **\n\n**Respect and appreciate the body we live in and make the most of its potential, whatever our age! And, watch our self-talk.**\n\nI say this to you now, but remember, as stated a few paragraphs above, our subconscious is always listening (kind of like Alexa) to whatever soundtrack you play it! It’s in our power to change that soundtrack to one that serves us much better!\n\nIf we can exercise, we are privileged to be able to do so. There are many people in this world who are not as fortunate, and would love to be able to exercise their bodies as freely as we are able to, and sometimes this can be the reminder we need to re-commit to respecting our bodies and doing what we can, when we can, to enjoyable move and strengthen it.\n\nSure I had a brain hemorrhage nearly 5 years ago, from the time of writing, and you bet I use this as an excuse to often not do things. (An important point, in some cases this makes sense, and in other cases definitely not, but I can’t let that define who I am now.)\n\nWhen I exercise smartly around three times per week, then I feel all the better for it. When I get up earlier to walk the dog, I feel better for it. You get the picture. Better in myself but also in how I show up for Jess, Olive and those around me.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt said “Comparison is the thief of joy”. Often this is used to relate to others, especially in these days of social media when everyone can seem to have a better house, life, body, car, etc. (fill the gaps) than you, if not careful. \n\nWe need to ‘Stay in our own lane!’ as they say, and focus on us. ** \n **\n\nHowever what happens when you do focus on you too much, in your own lane, and the comparison you are making is with your old self? If we are not careful, the end result can be the joy getting stolen in just the same way as a comparison to others.\n\nNow I know all of what I say is generalised and there are outliers, but also remember what I said earlier where there is always someone supposedly worse off than us, making a better job of their situation. \n\nAdversity in some people really gets them to step up their game, and they achieve more in their seemingly tougher circumstances than many of us do in our normal circumstances.\n\nAnyway what is my point and how can you start to change this and alter any non-serving self-talk? ** \n **\n\n(By the way this is just from my experience, so take it as just that and if you need more specialised help then seek it sooner rather than later. The mind is infinitely complex, so a slight misfire somewhere may be easy to fix by the right person who specialises in that area.)\n\nWell, for me, it starts with being kinder to myself and realising I am just human, and we all have ups and downs.** \n **\n\nNext step for me is tuning into when I am saying stuff to myself or others that does not serve them or me.\n\nAfter that, it is trying to reprogram what I am in the habit of saying to myself (when it is negative) and replacing it with something constructive.\n\nThe next step is to make an effort to get in the habit of saying more positive things than otherwise.\n\nIt all takes time and effort, but it is worth it!!\n\nIn place of me saying \"I can’t train like I did before!\". I now say \"I am very happy, and grateful to be training right now!\"\n\nIn my next 'Tom’s Tips' I will talk a little about something else that is starting to really make a positive uplift in my life and how it could do the same for you or anyone else if you apply it. Once again, it was something that I knew about, and you will too, but I had got out of the habit of doing it. So crucial to moving forward.\n\nAll the best\n\nTom \n\n** \n ** \n \n\n \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1656086419, "digest": "DnOJuBvcToT8MXv9EndrOlIZ6avUbc-QsJlFTwuERQk", "contributor": "0xd63c4496F130DE5006Fb622215D763766C9D48Ca"}

{"id": "L8ktXiNqg8DI8afrG4nhRilqq3dkp9T9Q9oFOQi6vYg", "title": "The \"crypto\" in cryptocurrency", "body": "The word “crypto” may spark images in your mind of ciphers, code breaking and even Bletchley park’s involvement in World War 2. I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). From his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. The idea that information wants to find its way into every nook and cranny does have consequences (for the better or worse). For example, information leaks can help us learn about atrocities committed by government, but it can also be used by the government for surveillance of its citizens. \n\nCryptography is a tool that enables us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. It has similarities to the perspective of David vs Goliath as cryptography is one of the only tools that allows a citizen to successfully fend against a nation state actor. In fact, for most of cryptography’s history, it is a tool that allows the defender to protect itself from an all-powerful adversary. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA protocol designed using cryptography tends to have three goals: \n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is not concerned with confidentiality. It is only focused on integrity and authentication. Both goals form the backbone for decentralization as it allows anyone to verify: \n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nPut another way, decentralization relies on a property called public verifiability. This property allows anyone to fetch data from an untrusted source and independently check if the relevant computation (and data) is correct. Applied to cryptocurrency, it allows a network of users to continuously check the blockchain’s integrity and ultimately protect our assets represented in the database. \n\nIf a user cannot get access to the data, or if the cryptography did not exist, then we must blindly trust an authority to protect the system -- essentially how the legacy financial system works today. \n\n## Twitter for your bank account\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\nNewcomers find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange. Very often, this is because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use on the dark web to buy drugs. The very name, -crypto-currency, can help lead to that misunderstanding. \n\nUnfortunately for criminals, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most traceable currencies in the world. It is a really bad tool for their desired purpose as the historical transactions are replicated across the world and kept forever. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose. \n\nIn fact, even for crime that originates on the network, there are some fun examples to consider:\n\n* **Bitfinex hacker**. The FBI helped recover [over 94k BTC](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency) from the hacker on behalf of Bitfinex. In typical crypto fashion, the hacker was an amateur rapper called [“Razzlekhan”](https://cointelegraph.com/news/comedic-rapper-charged-with-involvement-in-bitfinex-hack-out-on-bail) and a [sophisticated social engineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/agedlikemilk/comments/sskkj6/heather_morgan_giving_a_presentation_on_social/) attacker. They got caught after trying to cash out a small portion of the stolen bitcoins.  \n* **OpenSea insider trading.** A twitter user found credible evidence, using transactions in the blockchain, that a product manager at OpenSea were buying NFTs before they were announced on the homepage (and then sold for a premium). The [SEC will use this evidence](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-117) for proceedings against the ex-employee. \n* **MtGox repeatedly hacked.** The exchange was responsible for loosing around \\~6% of all Bitcoin. An investigation by WizSec, [using blockchain data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l70iRcSxqzo&ab_channel=TheBitcoinArmy), found credible evidence that the exchange was not solvent for a long time. \n\nWhile the lack of confidentiality has helped the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the eyes of regulators and law enforcement, confidentiality is still a sought-after feature to protect the right of users to transact. A number of cryptocurrency networks exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees for transferring assets including ZCash, Aztec Protocol and Monero. The new frontier of research and development is focused on building smart contract platforms that support confidentiality for some aspects of the application.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThere are only two primitives to consider and we have put together a dedicated article for each primitive alongside a brief explanation. \n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature. A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity. They can compute the credentials (public-private key pair) locally on their machine. The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer. A signature is timeless and it can be verified at any point in time. In fact, we can check all historical transactions in a network like Bitcoin and verify the signer was indeed authorised to spend the coins", "timestamp": 1656086688, "digest": "a4Y0TrLL7BcS8rarDfDVQW6HJKSTydm5K7u2sEqC2wA", "contributor": "0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5"}

This guide will cover tools and techniques for researching each, red flags to look for, and general tips on how to go about learning as much as you can about a project. This is a reference guide that will be updated regularly to include new tools and services available, emerging threats in the space, and timely examples.\n\n### Overview\n\n“Do your own research”, or DYOR is perhaps the most common phrase in crypto today. It is used as both advice and as a disclaimer whenever projects are discussed. But for all the influencers and investors that regularly tell people to DYOR, it’s rare that they ever say exactly *how*. Well, that’s exactly what this guide seeks to do. Researching a crypto project will be broken down into three categories:\n\n* The dev team, including their experience and past projects\n* The project itself, including fundamentals and tokenomics\n* The community across all social media platforms\n\nFor each category, I’ll provide research tips, free and paid online tools that can be used, red flags to look out for, and plenty of examples. This is by no means a definitive or all-inclusive guide, which is why I will treat it like a living document, with regular updates and additions as appropriate.\n\n### General Researching Guidelines\n\n* Take nothing at face value - verify all claims made as best you can\n* Use other people’s research as a benchmark for your own, not as a replacement\n* Learn to differentiate facts from opinions.\n* Get facts from known, trusted sources, and gather as many opinions as possible. People believe a wide spectrum of things, and the truth is usually somewhere in the middle of it all.\n* Always do your research *before* investing, not after.\n* Research is a skill. Like any other skill, it takes time to learn and practice to get better.\n\n### Developers and Core Team\n\nResearching a project’s developers and core team is the heart of KYC. All other research aside, if a team has a history of failed or abandoned projects, or they have pulled several exit scams in the past, then for me there is no need to research further. Finding this information can be tricky, though, and it’s only one of many things you should be looking at.\n\nKeep in mind, you are not likely to find everything you are looking for in one place. Especially when researching a team that is not fully doxed, it is more like putting together a puzzle, with pieces scattered all around the internet. Ultimately, your goal is to learn as much about the team’s experience, history, and motivations as you can. So, where do you start?\n\n* Is anyone on the team fully doxed? If so, check them out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/), and google their first and last name in quotes (ex: “Elon Musk”, with the quotes included). Look for any other projects they may have been involved with, and any independent verification of their experience (I can say I was a software engineer at Google on my Linkedin profile, but that doesn’t make it true). Be sure to check the News and Videos sections in Google as well. For developers, look for a Github account associated with their name to see what else they’ve built.\n\n![Always nice when the website includes dev's Linkedin profiles (pic: Landlord Token)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/x5rt7iQsCbwwqKNdnJuF8.JPG?height=590&width=1252)\n\n* Do a reverse image search on profile pictures or avatars used by the team:\n\n\n* [Google Images](https://images.google.com/)\n* [Bing Images](https://www.bing.com/images/feed)\n* [TinEye](https://tineye.com/)\n* [Yandex](https://yandex.com/images/)\n* [PimEyes](https://pimeyes.com/en) - facial search, great for helping to confirm a dox\n* [Baidu](https://image.baidu.com/) - Chinese site primarily focused on China-based content\n\n\n* Usernames can be searched on sites like [NameCheckup](https://namecheckup.com/) and [CheckUserNames](https://checkusernames.com/). These tools will search for the name across hundreds of sites, allowing you to see where else they might be active.\n* If any of the team has a personal Twitter account, [AllMyTweets](https://www.allmytweets.net/) will let you see their most recent (up to 5k) tweets and likes, which may yield some interesting or useful info.\n* If in doubt about anything, ask the team directly! If they respond, you have more information that you can verify. If they ignore you or push back on answering, ask yourself why. If you’re banned/blocked from a channel or server for asking, then you know you hit an important question, and should keep digging.\n\n### Project Foundation, Fundamentals, and Tokenomics\n\nThis research involves looking under the hood of a project to understand what makes it run. The smart contract, website, whitepaper, roadmap, and associated wallets can all hold valuable information about the project.\n\n* Check the contract on [TokenSniffer](https://tokensniffer.com/), [Scamsniper](https://scamsniper.net/) and [Honeypot.is](https://honeypot.is/). All are free, and will scan a smart contract for common malicious functions that might give owners the ability to rug. TokenSniffer will show you other smart contracts that have similar or identical code, so you can see how those projects faired. These services will also simulate sales to ensure the project is not a honeypot. If the project is still in presale, however, they can throw some false positives.\n* Another contract scanning service is [Rugscreen](https://www.rugscreen.com/). It’s more comprehensive than the other two, but costs a few dollars worth of BNB to run.\n* Check the contract and website on [ChainAbuse](https://www.chainabuse.com/) to see if they are connected to any known fraudulent activity.\n* On a block explorer, go to the wallet that created the contract to see where their funds came from, and if they have created any other contracts (be sure to check all chains the wallet is active on). If they have, spend some time looking into those projects as well, at least to see if any were rugged or abandoned.\n\n![This will show you all contracts created by a wallet on a particular chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G2qeV-agUis2qt67rMPtp.png?height=728&width=860)\n\n* Spend time on the website reading everything, and clicking all the links. If there are a lot of spelling or grammatical errors, broken links, non-functioning buttons, or other indications that minimal time has been put into developing the site, that’s a big warning sign. If the contract, roadmap, and whitepaper are not readily accessible on the site (or non-existent), that’s another warning sign. Generally speaking, the less effort that was put into the project as a whole, the bigger the red flag.\n\n![Love to see address, and Whitepaper/Roadmap/Team links all on the website header](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YCfW6uP59_AoF7RRhQiJj.png?height=311&width=1762)\n\n![Scam example: the more you look at these packages, the worse it gets](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_0Ldh-k5X9Y9P2SAZr_rc.JPG?height=911&width=1443)\n\n* Do an [ICANN](https://lookup.icann.org/) lookup on the website to see when it was created. Compare this to when a presale was listed, marketing on social media began, etc. Scam projects tend to be a quick flash in the pan - everything happens all at once, usually, within a week or two. Good projects take time to build.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z_R0s2atHyEinoN5_ty0A.png?height=1110&width=1244)\n\n* Take a look at the roadmap, and decide if the milestones, deliverables, and timetables listed seem reasonable, especially given what you know about the team. Scam and pump & dump projects thrive on hype, and that’s often reflected in outlandish roadmaps. Similarly, carefully consider what the project currently has built and deployed, versus what they are promising will come sometime in the future. If the entire value proposition of a project is built on what they say is coming, not what already exists, that’s a warning sign.\n\n![$50B market cap by next year? That would be the #4 largest crypto, excluding USDC/USDT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T7uapb_UC3sZBY2CGbsIc.JPG?height=321&width=450)\n\n* Give equal, if not more scrutiny to the whitepaper. Is it just repeating what’s on the website, or is it going into more detail? Google their mission statement (in quotes) or other generic-sounding parts of the whitepaper to see if they have been copied from other projects. Make sure the tokenomics and project details covered in the whitepaper match what is presented on the website and socials.\n* Be aware of the tokenomics, especially buy and sell taxes, and how they would impact the break-even point of your investment. For example:\n  * If a project has a 10% buy and sell tax, putting in $1k would get you $900 worth of tokens.\n  * You would need to sell $1111 worth of tokens to end up with $1k back in your wallet after the sell tax is taken out (1111 - (0.1 \\* 1111) = 1000).\n  * This means your initial $900 worth of tokens would have to increase in value to $1111 (a \\~24% increase) just to break even.\n  * A project with 5% buy/sell tax would need \\~11% price increase to break even, and a 15% buy/sell tax would take \\~38% price increase.\n* If the token offers staking, what is the Total Value Locked (TVL) percentage? A low percent may indicate holders are not interested in governance or longevity, and will instead sell when the price rises to their target. Conversely, a high TVL percent can indicate strong community faith in the project.\n* Be sure to verify all claims of contract audits and liquidity locks. If an audit has been done, read the report in full. If liquidity has been locked, find out what percentage of the total liquidity it is, how long it’s locked for, and what the team will do with the liquidity once it unlocks.\n* On a block explorer, check what percentage of tokens the largest wallet holders have. If one wallet owns 10% or more of the total circulating supply, they could cause a significant price drop if they sold all at once. Keep in mind, the block explorer will show the percent of *total* tokens owned, not *circulating* tokens. So, if 50% of the circulating supply has been burned, then the actual percentage owned by each wallet will be double what is shown.\n\n### Community and Social Media\n\nNo project can moon without everyone in the community helping to gas up the rocket. Communities can make or break a project, so you want to make sure you know as much about them as possible.\n\n* Check a project’s Twitter account on [SparkToro](https://sparktoro.com/fake-followers/) and [TwitterAudit](https://www.twitteraudit.com/) to get an idea of how many fake, botted, or inactive followers they have. If the account has used giveaways to gain followers, chances are they will have a lot. Followers gained by giveaways do not mean followers that are invested (or even interested) in the project.\n* Compare the number of followers or subscribers on each of the social media channels. Generally, Twitter and Telegram will be about equal, and Discord will be slightly lower. If there is a large discrepancy between platforms - say, if Telegram has 7k more followers than Twitter - it could indicate they artificially inflated their followers with fake accounts.\n* Do their Telegram and Discord channels have any helper bots set up (Rose, MEE6, WickBot, etc), or is moderating and sending official links completely manual? As with the roadmap, whitepaper, and website, the less effort that is put into a project, the bigger the red flag.\n* Spend some time chatting on each of the platforms. Are there active conversations from a large number of members, or just a regular stream of “wen lambo” memes? What how much engagement do tweets from the official account get? How active are the devs and core team on each of the socials? Are questions about the project answered, mocked, or ignored? Do community members seem genuinely excited about the project and supportive of the core team?\n* Search account handles and project-related hashtags on Twitter, and get an idea of what people are saying about it. Is there a lot of organic chatter from a bunch of different accounts, or are there only a few cheerleaders/influencers driving everything? What’s the overall sentiment when people talk about the project? Look at comments under tweets from the main account, as they are often from holders. Are they supportive of the project and team, or angry?\n\n![Vibe check: ......yikes](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ufy52kE1fFtpqw0WQeWeX.png?height=902&width=737)\n\n### The Takeaway\n\nWith few exceptions, no one source or piece of information will give you the full picture of a project and its team. Instead, you must piece together a mosaic using a wide variety of information, both qualitative and quantitative, and make your assessment from there based on your own risk tolerance. As a general rule of thumb, the amount of time you spend researching a project should be proportional to the amount of money you plan to invest in it.\n\n*Have a question, comment, tip, inside info, or anything else?

{"id": "Q2BGj9NYQT6Gn4m-zs7TOvR9NhEhPQ9rWO0w2OjmNoM", "title": "Importance of Community in Web3", "body": "With the democratization of web3 there is a large emphasis on community and member engagement / interaction. We are seeing this with DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, that give power to the people. The way DAOs give the power to people is having a structure that is community led and has no central authority. In Web2, we saw a lot of companies shoving products on consumers forcing them to accept it at face value until a better offering came around. Web3 is set up in a way where organizations listen to their community to make decisions for the product and the success of the product is shared throughout the community. \n\nThere is lots of speculation around DAOs becoming the dominant form of governance in the future because of the way responsibilities are divided and decisions are made. Undoubtedly, however, they provide a solid framework for the way in which we think about how communities and \"customers\" should be involved in the creation and success of projects aimed at creating real world utility. Here is why community managers, moderators and members of NFT projects that I spoke with think this shift is for the better.  \n\n**Providing a project where individuals feel a sense of purpose** \n\nThere is no better feeling than having your voice heard and members of a community stay to be part of the community, the NFT is just their ticket of admission to that community. As one community member put it “I’ve really always felt nfts, at least rn, are mostly \\[about\\]  access to token-gated communities which people can relate to.” \n\nPeople in these communities relate to others and have their voice heard. Ultimately giving them a broader purpose to be more than just a holder of an NFT. \n\n**Community is the main driver making products successful** \n\nThere are so many great artists whose work never gets the traction it deserves. Meanwhile we see what catches the eye as not very artistic projects making millions but they have strong communities with events planned for members. This is what makes them strong projects.\n\nThis is an issue many face and the great artists who are struggling to build a community now should check this article out for that reason [“your values and culture as a collection and community should be clear to all new members.”](https://mirror.xyz/vataj.eth/r-f22Etw1_AzlqEmRHVPtsLPzW05H2Cph8-pHtM1hPY) This is a quote from vataj.eth, check this piece out, there are some great points here anyone can learn from even the biggest collections. \n\n**There is value in being a member**  \n\nOne community member I talked to told me of their experience of getting involved with a project. The initial goal of getting involved was buying and flipping the art but once the members saw how much regard the owners and moderators of the project had for the community they stayed. \n\nThis is one thing that often is overlooked by people getting into the NFT space. Most see the dollar sign attached and that's what draws them. Individuals initially did not value the benefit of community but once they become part of communities they find a purpose being involved. \n\nCome for the art, stay for the community. \n\n**Anyone from anywhere and any background is welcome** \n\nQuite possibly the best part of having a community in web3 is the ability for any individual to join. The only barrier to entry is internet access and a device that connects to the internet and you are able to be part of a community. Some projects have a price point much too high but there is a community out there for you. \n\n**Takeaway**\n\nNothing is perfect, especially in early stages. We are all learning as we go, but if we continue to learn as communities in web3 and empower one and other to achieve more this space will be able to break down barriers and move humankind forward in such a powerful way. In the end, web3 is bringing people happiness and meaning all through community. I hope community managers, moderators and members each got something valuable out of this article.\n\n \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1656087021, "digest": "pUmj1ocx0s9KxEm-5fYRpsV8zaquQKZ72WajELhcQzg", "contributor": "0x5E73842a3A8946932a78358F4F80fAD96005E4e7"}

This guide will cover tools and techniques for researching each, red flags to look for, and general tips on how to go about learning as much as you can about a project. This is a reference guide that will be updated regularly to include new tools and services available, emerging threats in the space, and timely examples.\n\n### Overview\n\n“Do your own research”, or DYOR is perhaps the most common phrase in crypto today. It is used as both advice and as a disclaimer whenever projects are discussed. But for all the influencers and investors that regularly tell people to DYOR, it’s rare that they ever say exactly *how*. Well, that’s exactly what this guide seeks to do. Researching a crypto project will be broken down into three categories:\n\n* The dev team, including their experience and past projects\n* The project itself, including fundamentals and tokenomics\n* The community across all social media platforms\n\nFor each category, I’ll provide research tips, free and paid online tools that can be used, red flags to look out for, and plenty of examples. This is by no means a definitive or all-inclusive guide, which is why I will treat it like a living document, with regular updates and additions as appropriate.\n\n### General Researching Guidelines\n\n* Take nothing at face value - verify all claims made as best you can\n* Use other people’s research as a benchmark for your own, not as a replacement\n* Learn to differentiate facts from opinions.\n* Get facts from known, trusted sources, and gather as many opinions as possible. People believe a wide spectrum of things, and the truth is usually somewhere in the middle of it all.\n* Always do your research *before* investing, not after.\n* Research is a skill. Like any other skill, it takes time to learn and practice to get better.\n\n### Developers and Core Team\n\nResearching a project’s developers and core team is the heart of KYC. All other research aside, if a team has a history of failed or abandoned projects, or they have pulled several exit scams in the past, then for me there is no need to research further. Finding this information can be tricky, though, and it’s only one of many things you should be looking at.\n\nKeep in mind, you are not likely to find everything you are looking for in one place. Especially when researching a team that is not fully doxed, it is more like putting together a puzzle, with pieces scattered all around the internet. Ultimately, your goal is to learn as much about the team’s experience, history, and motivations as you can. So, where do you start?\n\n* Is anyone on the team fully doxed? If so, check them out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/), and google their first and last name in quotes (ex: “Elon Musk”, with the quotes included). Look for any other projects they may have been involved with, and any independent verification of their experience (I can say I was a software engineer at Google on my Linkedin profile, but that doesn’t make it true). Be sure to check the News and Videos sections in Google as well. For developers, look for a Github account associated with their name to see what else they’ve built.\n\n![Always nice when the website includes dev's Linkedin profiles (pic: Landlord Token)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/x5rt7iQsCbwwqKNdnJuF8.JPG?height=590&width=1252)\n\n* Do a reverse image search on profile pictures or avatars used by the team:\n\n\n* [Google Images](https://images.google.com/)\n* [Bing Images](https://www.bing.com/images/feed)\n* [TinEye](https://tineye.com/)\n* [Yandex](https://yandex.com/images/)\n* [PimEyes](https://pimeyes.com/en) - facial search, great for helping to confirm a dox\n* [Baidu](https://image.baidu.com/) - Chinese site primarily focused on China-based content\n\n\n* Usernames can be searched on sites like [NameCheckup](https://namecheckup.com/) and [CheckUserNames](https://checkusernames.com/). These tools will search for the name across hundreds of sites, allowing you to see where else they might be active.\n* If any of the team has a personal Twitter account, [AllMyTweets](https://www.allmytweets.net/) will let you see their most recent (up to 5k) tweets and likes, which may yield some interesting or useful info.\n* If in doubt about anything, ask the team directly! If they respond, you have more information that you can verify. If they ignore you or push back on answering, ask yourself why. If you’re banned/blocked from a channel or server for asking, then you know you hit an important question, and should keep digging.\n\n### Project Foundation, Fundamentals, and Tokenomics\n\nThis research involves looking under the hood of a project to understand what makes it run. The smart contract, website, whitepaper, roadmap, and associated wallets can all hold valuable information about the project.\n\n* Check the contract on [TokenSniffer](https://tokensniffer.com/), [Scamsniper](https://scamsniper.net/) and [Honeypot.is](https://honeypot.is/). All are free, and will scan a smart contract for common malicious functions that might give owners the ability to rug. TokenSniffer will show you other smart contracts that have similar or identical code, so you can see how those projects faired. These services will also simulate sales to ensure the project is not a honeypot. If the project is still in presale, however, they can throw some false positives.\n* Another contract scanning service is [Rugscreen](https://www.rugscreen.com/). It’s more comprehensive than the other two, but costs a few dollars worth of BNB to run.\n* Check the contract and website on [ChainAbuse](https://www.chainabuse.com/) to see if they are connected to any known fraudulent activity.\n* On a block explorer, go to the wallet that created the contract to see where their funds came from, and if they have created any other contracts (be sure to check all chains the wallet is active on). If they have, spend some time looking into those projects as well, at least to see if any were rugged or abandoned.\n\n![This will show you all contracts created by a wallet on a particular chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G2qeV-agUis2qt67rMPtp.png?height=728&width=860)\n\n* Spend time on the website reading everything, and clicking all the links. If there are a lot of spelling or grammatical errors, broken links, non-functioning buttons, or other indications that minimal time has been put into developing the site, that’s a big warning sign. If the contract, roadmap, and whitepaper are not readily accessible on the site (or non-existent), that’s another warning sign. Generally speaking, the less effort that was put into the project as a whole, the bigger the red flag.\n\n![Love to see address, and Whitepaper/Roadmap/Team links all on the website header](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YCfW6uP59_AoF7RRhQiJj.png?height=311&width=1762)\n\n![Scam example: the more you look at these packages, the worse it gets](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_0Ldh-k5X9Y9P2SAZr_rc.JPG?height=911&width=1443)\n\n* Do an [ICANN](https://lookup.icann.org/) lookup on the website to see when it was created. Compare this to when a presale was listed, marketing on social media began, etc. Scam projects tend to be a quick flash in the pan - everything happens all at once, usually, within a week or two. Good projects take time to build.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z_R0s2atHyEinoN5_ty0A.png?height=1110&width=1244)\n\n* Take a look at the roadmap, and decide if the milestones, deliverables, and timetables listed seem reasonable, especially given what you know about the team. Scam and pump & dump projects thrive on hype, and that’s often reflected in outlandish roadmaps. Similarly, carefully consider what the project currently has built and deployed, versus what they are promising will come sometime in the future. If the entire value proposition of a project is built on what they say is coming, not what already exists, that’s a warning sign.\n\n![$50B market cap by next year? That would be the #4 largest crypto, excluding USDC/USDT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T7uapb_UC3sZBY2CGbsIc.JPG?height=321&width=450)\n\n* Give equal, if not more scrutiny to the whitepaper. Is it just repeating what’s on the website, or is it going into more detail? Google their mission statement (in quotes) or other generic-sounding parts of the whitepaper to see if they have been copied from other projects. Make sure the tokenomics and project details covered in the whitepaper match what is presented on the website and socials.\n* Be aware of the tokenomics, especially buy and sell taxes, and how they would impact the break-even point of your investment. For example:\n  * If a project has a 10% buy and sell tax, putting in $1k would get you $900 worth of tokens.\n  * You would need to sell $1111 worth of tokens to end up with $1k back in your wallet after the sell tax is taken out (1111 - (0.1 \\* 1111) = 1000).\n  * This means your initial $900 worth of tokens would have to increase in value to $1111 (a \\~24% increase) just to break even.\n  * A project with 5% buy/sell tax would need \\~11% price increase to break even, and a 15% buy/sell tax would take \\~38% price increase.\n* If the token offers staking, what is the Total Value Locked (TVL) percentage? A low percent may indicate holders are not interested in governance or longevity, and will instead sell when the price rises to their target. Conversely, a high TVL percent can indicate strong community faith in the project.\n* Be sure to verify all claims of contract audits and liquidity locks. If an audit has been done, read the report in full. If liquidity has been locked, find out what percentage of the total liquidity it is, how long it’s locked for, and what the team will do with the liquidity once it unlocks.\n* On a block explorer, check what percentage of tokens the largest wallet holders have. If one wallet owns 10% or more of the total circulating supply, they could cause a significant price drop if they sold all at once. Keep in mind, the block explorer will show the percent of *total* tokens owned, not *circulating* tokens. So, if 50% of the circulating supply has been burned, then the actual percentage owned by each wallet will be double what is shown.\n\n### Community and Social Media\n\nNo project can moon without everyone in the community helping to gas up the rocket. Communities can make or break a project, so you want to make sure you know as much about them as possible.\n\n* Check a project’s Twitter account on [SparkToro](https://sparktoro.com/fake-followers/) and [TwitterAudit](https://www.twitteraudit.com/) to get an idea of how many fake, botted, or inactive followers they have. If the account has used giveaways to gain followers, chances are they will have a lot. Followers gained by giveaways do not mean followers that are invested (or even interested) in the project.\n* Compare the number of followers or subscribers on each of the social media channels. Generally, Twitter and Telegram will be about equal, and Discord will be slightly lower. If there is a large discrepancy between platforms - say, if Telegram has 7k more followers than Twitter - it could indicate they artificially inflated their followers with fake accounts.\n* Do their Telegram and Discord channels have any helper bots set up (Rose, MEE6, WickBot, etc), or is moderating and sending official links completely manual? As with the roadmap, whitepaper, and website, the less effort that is put into a project, the bigger the red flag.\n* Spend some time chatting on each of the platforms. Are there active conversations from a large number of members, or just a regular stream of “wen lambo” memes? What how much engagement do tweets from the official account get? How active are the devs and core team on each of the socials? Are questions about the project answered, mocked, or ignored? Do community members seem genuinely excited about the project and supportive of the core team?\n* Search account handles and project-related hashtags on Twitter, and get an idea of what people are saying about it. Is there a lot of organic chatter from a bunch of different accounts, or are there only a few cheerleaders/influencers driving everything? What’s the overall sentiment when people talk about the project? Look at comments under tweets from the main account, as they are often from holders. Are they supportive of the project and team, or angry?\n\n![Vibe check: ......yikes](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ufy52kE1fFtpqw0WQeWeX.png?height=902&width=737)\n\n### The Takeaway\n\nWith few exceptions, no one source or piece of information will give you the full picture of a project and its team. Instead, you must piece together a mosaic using a wide variety of information, both qualitative and quantitative, and make your assessment from there based on your own risk tolerance. As a general rule of thumb, the amount of time you spend researching a project should be proportional to the amount of money you plan to invest in it.\n\n*Have a question, comment, tip, inside info, or anything else?

And the market value of ETH has converged with the downward trend of BTC.\n\nThe battle of new public chains has already occurred such as ETH sidechain or EVM-compatible form are developed to access ETH. Through quick module calls and friendly development experience, it has taken over the existing ecological users of ETH and has a certain network effect. The differentiation of multi-chain with different cultural preferences,regional groups,institutions and different concepts with new consensus of fundamental principles, etc., are all providing momentum for the continuous innovation and development of multi-chain. Let us refer to the funnel model. The innovation of decentralized finance (replaced by DeFi below) began in the ETH ecosystem. From the initial spark of fire to the market size of $315b, when ETH congested cities can’t carry new residents, the funnel model has flowed to the emerging public chains. At present, the scale of funds in DeFi is $92b. However, the long-term trend of web3 innovation has been created, and the scale of crypto assets and users will still maintain a ten-year growth curve.\n\nLet's start dismantling the major market sizes of Defi\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ofy9-GQosD0uNiBWjSK0W.png?height=720&width=1071)\n\nDex: $24b\n\nLending: $16.5b\n\nBridge: $11.21b\n\nCDP: $9.19b\n\nYield: $6.68b\n\nLiquid Staking: $6.16b\n\nAbout NFTs\n\nSince 2021, the NFT market has begun to boost. Stimulated by stars and wealth effects, now NFT is not only popular in the crypto circle, but also expanded to the world. From the initial cryptopunks to text loot, artwork, community meme, stars and brands, and then to the combination of Defi and NFT, the application-type NFT in the metaverse such as BAYC to the mayc of the derivative monkey, the NFT market is going through the era of wasteland like the cryptocurrency back then. The entire industry value chain of NFT is gradually getting rid of the early speculative trading and a series of product will guide this market into a new phase where value can be captured. If NFT is the next new entry which will lead billions of users into the crypto market, we can also refer to the funnel model to predict the flow of users, NFT>TOKEN>DEFI. We believe that the Defi and NFT will eventually converge, and the current total market value of NFTs is $22.7b.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IP8ZPds8cJj7yfQ79rjRJ.png?height=467&width=1280)\n\nAt present, the mature infrastructure of NFT market include: underlying public chain, Layer2, storage, GameFi, trading platform, wallet, tools, etc. We haven’t seen the builders do the right thing in the integration of NFT and Defi.

{"id": "NvJEwrIRaw4HY_AAX5L63PlXKI9w3mAkenbtvL6AYkQ", "title": "Dtravel Partners with Rent Responsibly\n", "body": "This week, Rent Responsibly [announced its newest 2022 partners](https://au.news.yahoo.com/rent-responsibly-announces-2022-partners-130000608.html), with Dtravel proudly named alongside nine other partners, including Expedia Group, NoiseAware and Breezeway.\n\n[Rent Responsibly](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/) is a community-building and education platform for local short-term rental (STR) alliances. By providing tools and alliance management services, Rent Responsibly equips local leaders to build successful, self-sustaining organizations of STR hosts, managers and all other stakeholders in their communities.\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover why we partnered with Rent Responsibly, how the partnership benefits the Dtravel ecosystem and how you can get involved.\n\n## Aligned Principles Key to Partnership\n\nRent Responsibly’s mission of bringing STR stakeholders together to empower them through knowledge sharing and the formation of local alliances is particularly aligned with our own principles.\n\nAt Dtravel, one of our primary goals is to fundamentally change what it means to be part of an STR community. We’re doing this by increasing ownership and encouraging greater direct involvement in the ecosystem through unrivaled decision-making power and influence for community members.\n\nThere are many aspects of STR hosting, and Dtravel is just one piece of the puzzle. Other considerations such as tax, insurance and property care are something that all hosts must inevitably deal with, and with a variety of conflicting advice strewn throughout the internet, joining STR alliances through Rent Responsibly is an inclusive way for hosts to connect with each other, regardless of whether they’re just getting started or looking to improve their established offering.\n\nIt’s important to recognize that the business of STR hosting is complex and can be daunting due to factors such as various STR regulations and tax legislation. Through partners like Dtravel, Rent Responsibly makes it easy for members to collaborate, solve common challenges, advocate for themselves and steward their communities.\n\nSince Dtravel utilizes web3 technologies that will be relatively new to many hosts, it’s especially important that we continue to educate hosts on how to use our product and the benefits that come with it — and what better way to do it than in the company of other incredible STR businesses working to enhance the hosting experience.\n\n## Benefits of the Partnership\n\nAs part of a select 2022 cohort comprising ten partners, the partnership puts a spotlight on Dtravel, highlighting our unique ecosystem to STR alliances across the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n\nThis opportunity will help generate interest from hosts who are passionate about a sustainable future for the STR industry, with the potential to increase the supply of Dtravel listings as a result.\n\nThe partnership will enable us to leverage the incredible work that Rent Responsibly has done to date by tapping into their rapidly growing database of tens of thousands of owners, hosts and property managers to share educational videos, advertisements and newsletter content with an engaged, high-quality audience.\n\nAlongside the brand and marketing potential associated with the partnership, we’ll also be able to expand our sales channels through speaking spots at quarterly virtual events, participation in biannual demo days and introductions to industry connections.\n\nThere are also a number of upcoming initiatives by the team to further drive traffic to Dtravel by assisting hosts and property managers to conveniently discover helpful STR products and service providers.\n\nFor hosts looking to take advantage of Rent Responsibly’s back catalog of useful content, check out their [Resource Library](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/resources/) for guides, webinars and host learnings that provide valuable insights into a variety of topics.\n\n## Register for the RR Summit for FREE\n\nEarlier this week, Rent Responsibly also unveiled their inaugural RR Summit, a two-day virtual conference taking place 12–13 July 2022 free to all STR owners across the globe.\n\nThe summit will feature 16 educational sessions with 2022 partners, Rent Responsibly staff and expert guest speakers. Topics will range from implementing smart practices to leveling up operations, navigating local laws, scaling sustainably, beating burnout and more.\n\nKeynote sessions will include a fireside chat with HomeAway co-founder Carl Shepherd and a Founders of the Future panel discussion.\n\nWe’ll be speaking on the second day of the summit about web3 being the future of direct bookings, so be sure to tune in then.\n\n[Register for the RR Summit](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/rr-summit-paths-to-professionalization/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=partner_dtravel)\n\n## Join the Community\n\n[Website](https://www.dtravel.com/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DtravelDAO) | [Telegram](https://t.me/dtravelcommunity) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dtravel)\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1656087994, "digest": "ylUfkVpTzYBfqidg8a1d7lQJDK33syHoG1AfUEMYuk0", "contributor": "0xae3565a8b566ebe2a99c6ca30f498c2b0DDF2196"}

I was intrigued by the mysterious tone of communication and the clues that were given. Even though the clues pointed to a possible connection to well-known participants in the cryptosphere, they were not the main reason for my fascination. I wasn't merely fascinated by *Teh Golden One* because Ryoshi might have something to do with it or there might be some connection to SHIB. No, I was fascinated because I could feel the same SPIRIT that fueled many of the experiments in decentralization in this very project. Something in me said \"this is the real deal\" - and I listened.\n\nMany players in the experiment of decentralization have purposefully chosen to remain anonymous and to not draw any attention to their personal identity. Ryoshi even went as far as stating that anyone who would meet him would likely be quite unimpressed. The point was never to glorify the inceptors of these ideas, but to embrace the ideas themselves, run with them, and actually use them to create a brighter world - each participant from a point of individual responsibility.\n\nResponsibility, however, is a curious subject for human beings at this stage of evolution. On one hand, we want the power, the keys to the kingdom, the right to exercise full control. On the other hand, we give all of our power away and project it onto whoever fits the bill in the moment it suits our agenda. Interestingly enough, one of Ryoshi's medium articles referred to this as 'pre-womb entitlement issues'.\n\nHaving difficulty with generating a society which is genuinely based on fully responsible participants, human beings have thus come up with all kinds of distorted implementations of governance. And these distortions have now weaseled their way into how decentralized mechanisms of governance are (mis)perceived.\n\nA common misperception of the principles of decentralization in governance is the following:\n\n> *In a decentralized governance structure, everyone should have identical rights and the idea that some 'special' rights could be earned is utterly against the principle of decentralization.*\n\nThis is the same as pretending that all 300 people on board a 747 are equally qualified to fly the plane, when only two (perhaps a few more among the passengers at most) are qualified to do so.\n\nThe flat out refusal to acknowledge peers in specific positions of functional authority which require qualification or merit and insisting on freely transferrable governance rights is a foolish psychological tendency which appears to be on the rise. And when it comes to decentralized organizations, it can lead to exploitable systems quite easily.\n\nAs ETH founder Vitalik Buterin states in his article \"Soulbound\"(<https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html>):\n\n> \"If the goal is for governance power to be widely distributed, then transferability is counterproductive as concentrated interests are more likely to buy the governance rights up from everyone else.\n>\n> If the goal is for governance power to go to the competent, then transferability is counterproductive because nothing stops the governance rights from being bought up by the determined but incompetent.\"\n\n## Enter Soulbound Governance Rights\n\nSoulbound governance describes certain governance rights only being available to holders of a nontranferrable (soulbound) governance token which cannot be purchased, but must be earned. Within the ecosystem of *Teh Golden DAO*, this token will be VALAR.\n\nWhile all GOLD 1 holders have the power to vote on proposals, VALAR holders will be the only participants in the DAO which can create these proposals on-chain.\n\nThere might be some who (incorrectly, in my opinion) interpret a structure which employs soulbound governance rights as a hierarchical power structure. A structure in which teh people are given an illusion of power while a select group moves all the strings in reality. It may seem contradictory at first, but this is precisely what soulbound governance principles are NOT about.\n\n> Perhaps our society has experienced so much abuse of leadership that everyone has become inherently cynical about governing circles of any kind. I don't blame anyone for that - it is no different for me.\n\nThe only issue is that, we often tend to counter this by abstracting human relationship in the decentralized realm to a point where \"everyone is the same\" and merit becomes irrelevant.\n\nThe very principle of a soulbound architecture, however, is precisely the kind of merit-based involvement and accountability that DO serve a positive outcome for EVERYONE involved.\n\nIt is foolish and naive to presume that all are equal in function, capacity, and intention within a unified structure. Unity does NOT equal sameness. Furthermore, sameness is NOT a prerequisite for harmony and positive outcome for all.\n\nThe implementation of soulbound governance rights is simply based on the acknowledgement of  these principles and the wish to design more suitable systems of governance accordingly.\n\nTo come back to the (perhaps a bit silly) example of the 747, would you want just anyone to be able to acquire the piloting rights? Or would you want the piloting rights to go to an individual that is qualified? When it comes to the governance of commercial aviation, would you want a pilot license to be transferable freely, so that a pilot who earned the license could simply sell it to anyone (regardless of qualification), if the price is right? Most likely not.\n\nMany people seem to confuse unity/equality with sameness, and therefore confuse decentralization with homogenization.\n\nI would make the following case, however:\n\n***DECENTRALIZATION ≠ HOMOGENIZATION***\n\n## A Practical Example of Potential Exploit\n\n#### Why It Could Be Detrimental for GOLD 1 Holders to Submit On-Chain Proposals Which Influence Soulbound Governance Structure\n\nLet's say all GOLD 1 (*Teh Golden One*'s base token) holders can freely submit on-chain proposals for the addition or removal of VALAR holders (VALAR is *The Golden One*'s Soulbound Governance Token). This works well enough, as long as ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE shares the same ethical standard and commitment to the project. But let's presume that one participating party (an individual or a group of participants), who happens to have access to significant resources, has different intentions.\n\nThis party will begin by setting up a whole armada of GOLD 1 holding wallets, as well as many different personas in our communication channels - thus getting everything ready to influence Teh Golden One's governance on a mass scale. This party will appear as a whole bunch of ordinary participants in the DAO, people like you and I. Gradually, they will vote out existing VALAR holders, and vote in more of their own \"virtual participants\". Over a relatively short amount of time, control over the entire DAO could effectively be in the hands of one single party, and the DAO's users - YOU - would be at their mercy. The consequences of this would be devastating.\n\n## A Personal Note on the Community of VALAR Holders\n\nMost, if not all of the individuals who will hold VALAR at the release of the DAO have walked through fire for *Teh Golden One* on more than one occasion. They have shown - in relationship to one another and to the community - that they are genuinely passionate about Teh Golden One's success - for reasons beyond their mere personal gain.\n\nA genuine degree of involvement and interest in the success of a project cannot be simply be measured by holding its base token. It can only be discovered in relationship to the community.\n\nI am truly excited to see what the future holds in store for Teh Golden DAO and look forward to exploring and refining this cutting-edge form of decentralized governance together.", "timestamp": 1656088512, "digest": "6-RWmGzGxvT-azU2w1-TMQXv_ntt73YfAH32dx0vVQg", "contributor": "0x787C58c1841132A2Bb3969e1b77D7A8449fD0c17"}

It may seem contradictory at first, but this is precisely what soulbound governance principles are NOT about.\n\n> Perhaps our society has experienced so much abuse of leadership that everyone has become inherently cynical about governing circles of any kind. I don't blame anyone for that - it is no different for me.\n\nThe only issue is that, we often tend to counter this by abstracting human relationship in the decentralized realm to a point where \"everyone is the same\" and merit becomes irrelevant.\n\nThe very principle of a soulbound architecture, however, is precisely the kind of merit-based involvement and accountability that DO serve a positive outcome for EVERYONE involved.\n\nIt is foolish and naive to presume that all are equal in function, capacity, and intention within a unified structure. Unity does NOT equal sameness. Furthermore, sameness is NOT a prerequisite for harmony and positive outcome for all.\n\nThe implementation of soulbound governance rights is simply based on the acknowledgement of  these principles and the wish to design more suitable systems of governance accordingly.\n\nTo come back to the (perhaps a bit silly) example of the 747, would you want just anyone to be able to acquire the piloting rights? Or would you want the piloting rights to go to an individual that is qualified? When it comes to the governance of commercial aviation, would you want a pilot license to be transferable freely, so that a pilot who earned the license could simply sell it to anyone (regardless of qualification), if the price is right? Most likely not.\n\nMany people seem to confuse unity/equality with sameness, and therefore confuse decentralization with homogenization.\n\nI would make the following case, however:\n\n***DECENTRALIZATION ≠ HOMOGENIZATION***\n\n## A Practical Example of Potential Exploit\n\n#### Why It Could Be Detrimental for GOLD 1 Holders to Submit On-Chain Proposals Which Influence Soulbound Governance Structure\n\nLet's say all GOLD 1 (*Teh Golden One*'s base token) holders can freely submit on-chain proposals for the addition or removal of VALAR holders (VALAR is *The Golden One*'s Soulbound Governance Token). This works well enough, as long as ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE shares the same ethical standard and commitment to the project. But let's presume that one participating party (an individual or a group of participants), who happens to have access to significant resources, has different intentions.\n\nThis party will begin by setting up a whole armada of GOLD 1 holding wallets, as well as many different personas in our communication channels - thus getting everything ready to influence Teh Golden One's governance on a mass scale. This party will appear as a whole bunch of ordinary participants in the DAO, people like you and I. Gradually, they will vote out existing VALAR holders, and vote in more of their own \"virtual participants\". Over a relatively short amount of time, control over the entire DAO could effectively be in the hands of one single party, and the DAO's users - YOU - would be at their mercy. The consequences of this would be devastating.\n\n## A Personal Note on the Community of VALAR Holders\n\nMost, if not all of the individuals who will hold VALAR at the release of the DAO have walked through fire for *Teh Golden One* on more than one occasion. They have shown - in relationship to one another and to the community - that they are genuinely passionate about Teh Golden One's success - for reasons beyond their mere personal gain.\n\nA genuine degree of involvement and interest in the success of a project cannot be simply be measured by holding its base token. It can only be discovered in relationship to the community.\n\nI am truly excited to see what the future holds in store for Teh Golden DAO and look forward to exploring and refining this cutting-edge form of decentralized governance together.", "timestamp": 1656088551, "digest": "6-RWmGzGxvT-azU2w1-TMQXv_ntt73YfAH32dx0vVQg", "contributor": "0x787C58c1841132A2Bb3969e1b77D7A8449fD0c17"}

By providing tools and alliance management services, Rent Responsibly equips local leaders to build successful, self-sustaining organizations of STR hosts, managers and all other stakeholders in their communities.\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover why we partnered with Rent Responsibly, how the partnership benefits the Dtravel ecosystem and how you can get involved.\n\n## Aligned Principles Key to Partnership\n\nRent Responsibly’s mission of bringing STR stakeholders together to empower them through knowledge sharing and the formation of local alliances is particularly aligned with our own principles.\n\nAt Dtravel, one of our primary goals is to fundamentally change what it means to be part of an STR community. We’re doing this by increasing ownership and encouraging greater direct involvement in the ecosystem through unrivaled decision-making power and influence for community members.\n\nThere are many aspects of STR hosting, and Dtravel is just one piece of the puzzle. Other considerations such as tax, insurance and property care are something that all hosts must inevitably deal with, and with a variety of conflicting advice strewn throughout the internet, joining STR alliances through Rent Responsibly is an inclusive way for hosts to connect with each other, regardless of whether they’re just getting started or looking to improve their established offering.\n\nIt’s important to recognize that the business of STR hosting is complex and can be daunting due to factors such as various STR regulations and tax legislation. Through partners like Dtravel, Rent Responsibly makes it easy for members to collaborate, solve common challenges, advocate for themselves and steward their communities.\n\nSince Dtravel utilizes web3 technologies that will be relatively new to many hosts, it’s especially important that we continue to educate hosts on how to use our product and the benefits that come with it — and what better way to do it than in the company of other incredible STR businesses working to enhance the hosting experience.\n\n## Benefits of the Partnership\n\nAs part of a select 2022 cohort comprising ten partners, the partnership puts a spotlight on Dtravel, highlighting our unique ecosystem to STR alliances across the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n\nThis opportunity will help generate interest from hosts who are passionate about a sustainable future for the STR industry, with the potential to increase the supply of Dtravel listings as a result.\n\nThe partnership will enable us to leverage the incredible work that Rent Responsibly has done to date by tapping into their rapidly growing database of tens of thousands of owners, hosts and property managers to share educational videos, advertisements and newsletter content with an engaged, high-quality audience.\n\nAlongside the brand and marketing potential associated with the partnership, we’ll also be able to expand our sales channels through speaking spots at quarterly virtual events, participation in biannual demo days and introductions to industry connections.\n\nThere are also a number of upcoming initiatives by the team to further drive traffic to Dtravel by assisting hosts and property managers to conveniently discover helpful STR products and service providers.\n\nFor hosts looking to take advantage of Rent Responsibly’s back catalog of useful content, check out their [Resource Library](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/resources/) for guides, webinars and host learnings that provide valuable insights into a variety of topics.\n\n## Register for the RR Summit for FREE\n\nEarlier this week, Rent Responsibly also unveiled their inaugural RR Summit, a two-day virtual conference taking place 12–13 July 2022 free to all STR owners across the globe.\n\nThe summit will feature 16 educational sessions with 2022 partners, Rent Responsibly staff and expert guest speakers. Topics will range from implementing smart practices to leveling up operations, navigating local laws, scaling sustainably, beating burnout and more.\n\nKeynote sessions will include a fireside chat with HomeAway co-founder Carl Shepherd and a Founders of the Future panel discussion.\n\nWe’ll be speaking on the second day of the summit about web3 being the future of direct bookings, so be sure to tune in then.\n\n[Register for the RR Summit](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/rr-summit-paths-to-professionalization/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=partner_dtravel)\n\n## Join the Community\n\n[Website](https://www.dtravel.com/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DtravelDAO) | [Telegram](https://t.me/dtravelcommunity) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dtravel)\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1656088438, "digest": "ylUfkVpTzYBfqidg8a1d7lQJDK33syHoG1AfUEMYuk0", "contributor": "0xae3565a8b566ebe2a99c6ca30f498c2b0DDF2196"}
{"id": "tfCs0IsK-ZhKBjvtz7uHEKDRgQrh4lZqMPq4rO-LiPA", "title": "Thoughts on Soulbound Governance in DAOs", "body": "*(Note: the following article reflects my own personal thoughts and stands in no official association with Teh Golden One. )*\n\nI found out about *Teh Golden One* on the same day the token launched on ETH. I was intrigued by the mysterious tone of communication and the clues that were given. Even though the clues pointed to a possible connection to well-known participants in the cryptosphere, they were not the main reason for my fascination. I wasn't merely fascinated by *Teh Golden One* because Ryoshi might have something to do with it or there might be some connection to SHIB. No, I was fascinated because I could feel the same SPIRIT that fueled many of the experiments in decentralization in this very project. Something in me said \"this is the real deal\" - and I listened.\n\nMany players in the experiment of decentralization have purposefully chosen to remain anonymous and to not draw any attention to their personal identity. Ryoshi even went as far as stating that anyone who would meet him would likely be quite unimpressed. The point was never to glorify the inceptors of these ideas, but to embrace the ideas themselves, run with them, and actually use them to create a brighter world - each participant from a point of individual responsibility.\n\nResponsibility, however, is a curious subject for human beings at this stage of evolution. On one hand, we want the power, the keys to the kingdom, the right to exercise full control. On the other hand, we give all of our power away and project it onto whoever fits the bill in the moment it suits our agenda. Interestingly enough, one of Ryoshi's medium articles referred to this as 'pre-womb entitlement issues'.\n\nHaving difficulty with generating a society which is genuinely based on fully responsible participants, human beings have thus come up with all kinds of distorted implementations of governance. And these distortions have now weaseled their way into how decentralized mechanisms of governance are (mis)perceived.\n\nA common misperception of the principles of decentralization in governance is the following:\n\n*In a decentralized governance structure, everyone should have identical rights and the idea that some 'special' rights could be earned is utterly against the principle of decentralization.*\n\nThis is the same as pretending that all 300 people on board a 747 are equally qualified to fly the plane, when only two (perhaps a few more among the passengers at most) are qualified to do so.\n\nThe flat out refusal to acknowledge peers in specific positions of functional authority which require qualification or merit and insisting on freely transferrable governance rights is a foolish psychological tendency which appears to be on the rise. And when it comes to decentralized organizations, it can lead to exploitable systems quite easily.\n\nAs ETH founder Vitalik Buterin states in his article \"Soulbound\"(<https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html>):\n\n\"If the goal is for governance power to be widely distributed, then transferability is counterproductive as concentrated interests are more likely to buy the governance rights up from everyone else.\n\nIf the goal is for governance power to go to the competent, then transferability is counterproductive because nothing stops the governance rights from being bought up by the determined but incompetent.\"\n\n## Enter Soulbound Governance Rights\n\nSoulbound governance describes certain governance rights only being available to holders of a nontranferrable (soulbound) governance token which cannot be purchased, but must be earned. Within the ecosystem of *Teh Golden DAO*, this token will be VALAR.\n\nWhile all GOLD 1 holders have the power to vote on proposals, VALAR holders will be the only participants in the DAO which can create these proposals on-chain.\n\nThere might be some who (incorrectly, in my opinion) interpret a structure which employs soulbound governance rights as a hierarchical power structure. A structure in which teh people are given an illusion of power while a select group moves all the strings in reality. It may seem contradictory at first, but this is precisely what soulbound governance principles are NOT about.\n\nPerhaps our society has experienced so much abuse of leadership that everyone has become inherently cynical about governing circles of any kind.

Unity does NOT equal sameness. Furthermore, sameness is NOT a prerequisite for harmony and positive outcome for all.\n\nThe implementation of soulbound governance rights is simply based on the acknowledgement of  these principles and the wish to design more suitable systems of governance accordingly.\n\nTo come back to the (perhaps a bit silly) example of the 747, would you want just anyone to be able to acquire the piloting rights?

{"id": "ss8sQq_FFD1CJSa7-hncdA6kTgHMAzLdpmJHtbo7wb0", "title": "Exploring the Lensverse - One Month After Mainnet 🌿💚", "body": "It’s been a month since the incredible launch of Lens on mainnet. With the devs leveraging Lens’ composability and open-source code, we’ve seen so many great apps and experiences being built across the ecosystem with users flowing between both, taking their graph and content with them all over. Let’s see what the community buildoors have been working on👇🌿\n\n### Lenster 🌸\n\nFirst up in the spotlight is [Lenster,](https://lenster.xyz/) a build by [@yoginth.lens](https://lenster.xyz/u/yoginth.lens). Lenster is well known in the community as Lens’ first Web3 social experience that acts as the most full-featured way to use Lens Protocol to interact with your social graph. Leveraging many of the exciting features built on Lens, Lenster allows your frens to not only follow you and mirror your content but also to collect it per the module you choose to have them collect by.\n\nWith additional super features available such as superfollow and monetization of your posts and memes, Lenster provides users with a Web3 native social experience in line with what they're used to in Web2. On Lens, your content and your data are both yours. It is up to you to choose what you do with it and if other people can own it.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RfdRdKMkvCGXRK7DKtgP9.png?height=1640&width=2870)\n\n### The purple-haired buildoor that stormed the ecosystem\n\nFeaturing next under today’s spotlight is a community buildoor who, over the past few weeks, has planted a seed full of exciting tools and apps. [@m1guelpf.lens](https://lenster.xyz/u/m1guelpf.lens) came in like a storm, building various projects in less than a couple of days at a time and left the most beautiful garden for the bloomers to explore!\n\n> ### “Lens protocol is such an amazing source of inspiration. They've basically created the perfect decentralized social storage, indexed by default and with stellar APIs for devs. Wanna recreate Twitter, Reddit or Mirror? You just need to make a frontend!” - Miguel Piedrafita\n\nOn Miguel’s first visit to the garden, he planted the all-exciting [Lens Leaderboard](https://lenster.xyz/posts/0xf5-0x16) which works by leveraging Lens’ open-source code to display profiles via a ranking that was decided as those most popular and active in the ecosystem. Now well used within the community, the Lens leaderboard is ever-changing as bloomers’ interactions are constantly being stored and updated to reflect a real-time leaderboard.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oYnzC9Z_eI6fKy4w4h8Ot.png?height=1598&width=2859)\n\nMiguel’s next seed of creation was [Refract](https://lenster.xyz/posts/0xf5-0x17), an OG news site full of news and interesting links for hackers just like Hacker News, but according to Miguel, more crypto friendly. Each morning, we now grab our cup of coffee, give it a scroll and see what’s new!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bjUwmaKejAoNGjjMI6CIb.png?height=545&width=1344)\n\nAfter growing tired of only being able to access the current version of the app on safari, Miguel then wrapped Lenster up all into one [mobile app](https://lenster.xyz/posts/0xf5-0x1b). Now you can access it anywhere on the go! 📲\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vogiqc1FqwQhqoycRAtvi.png?height=1541&width=2852)\n\nProviding users with a way to seamlessly cross-post on Lens and Twitter, Miguel’s next build was this magical tool, [Reflect](https://lenster.xyz/posts/0xf5-0x24)! 🪄\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Eks9G3oNPuyvoKH4N1SIn.png?height=1633&width=2874)\n\nWe’re so impressed with Miguel’s talent and dedication to building out the ecosystem to provide great apps and experiences for us all. We can’t wait to see what this buildoor cooks up for us next 👀🌿\n\n### The Cultivator\n\nThe next community buildoor in today’s spotlight is Maui, the creator of [Cultivator](https://lens-cultivator.vercel.app/), an app planted directly in the centre of the Lensverse. You can access Cultivator to visualize your network and connections within the broader Lens social graph. Discover the mutual followers you hold with others and see how interconnected you are ✨\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RLm8RDTgKG_t7JaAp7Q6M.png?height=1567&width=2837)\n\n### Iris\n\nNow, this next app has been growing in the ecosystem since the beginning of the LFGrow Hackathon in collaboration with [ETHGlobal](https://lenster.xyz/u/ethglobal.lens) 👀 Introducing [Iris](https://www.iris.social/), the platform that welcomes a new age of social media! By taking all of their favorite social platforms and combining them into one cohesive decentralized application, Iris gives you – the user – control over who views your content.\n\nDesigned to encourage a more organic reach while still being able to create posts for only those who follow you, users of Iris pay a subscription price to follow their favorite creators to access exclusive content with the price being set wholly by the creators themselves. See what your favourite creators are up to on Iris and don’t forget to follow them if you want to see everything that they’re posting! 👀\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fhenR4w4mS7cAiuW12CWh.png?height=1623&width=2872)\n\n### Phaver\n\nBuilt to reward its users, [Phaver](https://phaver.com/) is another Lens-powered app that blossomed during the LFGrow Hackathon. Phaver allows users to curate the most interesting content both on and offline, and get rewarded for it! So, how does it work? Well Phaver DAO will share a majority of the platform ownership with the users they consider to create the most value. If you enjoy curating and sharing content online, then why not dive in and give it a go?\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jz2alIa9F2rwGeTKYBguh.png?height=1622&width=2859)\n\n### Zilly\n\nBuilt during the LFGrow Hackathon also, [Zilly](https://zilly.social/) is another project that has bloomed over the past few months. With a belief that in Web3 the community is everything, Zilly works to ensure that all of its members feel as if they belong. They do this by empowering and coordinating their users to encourage them to later become contributors. What a great way to build a community 🤝\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/h530JS_iNw5bbN1GZotMe.png?height=571&width=1644)\n\n### Clipto\n\nSimilar to Cameo but more inclusive and flexible, [Clipto](https://clipto.io/) offers users the opportunity to request personalized videos from their favorite crypto stars! Users can access the app to create a connection between themselves and their favorite creators by requesting personalized videos from anyone. Who will you be requesting your first video from? 🧐\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NRYcwDEkLoau0513Yktiv.png?height=1576&width=2872)\n\n### TeaParty 🍵🌿\n\nPowering the Social-&-Earn (S&E) economy, [TeaParty](https://teaparty.life/) was a grant recipient in the first round of the Lens Grants Program. Built to reward socializing through a P2P and B2C incentivized network, TeaParty helps users deliver their content to the right audience by reaching directly to those who already organically interact and share their content. Now you can reach audiences who you know are genuinely interested in you for you 🙌\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5n7ZcHAwD5QKp-eYDtG2E.png?height=1633&width=2870)\n\n### Lens Booster\n\nConnecting advertisers and users together, Lens booster works to reward bloomers with fees when they post or mirror promotional content. By paying users according to the activity generated on the advertisers’ websites, dapps, and on-chain events, users can monetize their audience by sharing promotional materials with them. See how they tested it themselves below 👀👇\n\n> ### ”We tested the concept with Orbit, a DeFi protocol built by us, with an incentivized Lens post that received great feedback in terms of absolute and relative metrics , doubling the community overnight.” - Vincenzo Manzon, co-founder Lens Booster\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CzK9gDkbkxkVi99DC3qPE.png?height=1606&width=2857)\n\n### Developer DAO\n\nBuilding a Lens subgraph, [@nazeeh.lens](https://lenster.xyz/u/nazeeh.lens) and [@pdog355.lens](https://lenster.xyz/u/pdog355.lens) from Developer Dao have been making great progress since they began their build last month. Check out their work on [GitHub](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/Lens-Graph-Subgraph) and see what they’ve been up to!\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ntEwQSVlI3r4jAMzpim5i.png?height=1609&width=2869)\n\n### [Stats.lens.xyz](http://Stats.lens.xyz) 👀\n\nWant to see how the ecosystem is performing? Head to [stats.lens.xyz](http://stats.lens.xyz) where you can see all the latest stats on the garden including the total no. of profiles, posts, follows, collects, and even the total user-earned revenue 👀 it’s a great place to get a feel for how the garden is growing as the buildoors continue to build out the ecosystem👷🌿\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MAcc_gVBCEinKa21hsh8j.png?height=1631&width=2871)\n\n### Content collection campaigns\n\nTo date, creators have earned $37,576.17 on Lens Protocol through content collection campaigns using the Collect module. Most notably, [@](https://twitter.com/LensProtocol)[LensProtocol](https://lenster.xyz/u/lensprotocol) raised 50K MATIC across three posts for [@shefi.lens](https://lenster.xyz/u/shefi.lens) and the Lens grant fund. [@yoginth.lens](https://lenster.xyz/u/yoginth.lens) also raised 5K+ MATIC in a single post to keep [@lenster.lens](https://lenster.xyz/u/lenster.lens) a gas-covered user experience.\n\nThese new monetization tools will continue to make a big difference for many creators and developers out there. We can’t wait to see more fundraising experiments with this module!\n\n### Build with us 💚\n\nFeeling inspired by all this building, then why not check out the [Lens grants program](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=_Z8KjzukJ0ya9IkZ1i1a_OmxYApV6qFBmpyTxQ_BrENUQTc1SzROVkdIUzY0VEdYNUJJQVEwOE1LRS4u)? With $200K in grants already being given to buildoors over the past three months and $50K still remaining, stay tuned as we announce more funding for grants soon!\n\nNot looking to apply for a grant but instead, want to join the team? Check out our [open roles](https://apply.workable.com/aave/?lng=en)! There’s plenty of room to become a part of the fam 🤝\n\nWe can’t wait to continue this journey with you all! 🌿💚", "timestamp": 1656089308, "digest": "Y7ZHmQXOIXF6fC91cKvs0n4D2ViEieJCAbDHo4wI5-g", "contributor": "0x60e83Effc70A2c41770bB68641dDF36bb239197e"}

To make better decisions\n2. To increase the number of people who can effectively collaborate in decentralized organisations\n\nMany DAOs such as ENS, Decentraland and Proof of Humanity use [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org) for off-chain voting.\n\nThese DAOs choose one or more voting strategies on Snapshot <https://docs.snapshot.org/strategies/what-is-a-strategy>\n\nA voting strategy on [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org) that would enable direct+representative+augmented voting would allow eth addresses to delegate to a URL. E.g. my-voting-provider.com/user\n\nThen, the js code of the strategy would fetch something like my-voting-provider.com/user/space/proposal to know a vote.\n\nThese voting URLs would have no authentication. Anyone could see on my-voting-provider.com/USER/space/proposal would see the vote of the representative USER.\n\nThese URL voting providers are composable.\n\nFor example, provider1.com/BLUE could delegate to the following list:\n\n1. provider1.com/A\n2. provider1.com/B\n3. provider2.com/C\n\nIn the previous example, provider1 could also let BLUE vote directly.\n\nSo if BLUE doesn't vote but A does, BLUE would vote as A regardless of B and C. If BLUE and A don't vote but B does, BLUE would vote as B regardless of C. But if B doesn't vote either, do as C says.\n\nConsider that BLUE, A and B are from the same URL voting provider, but C doesn't.\n\nThis means that A and B can use delegation list + override like BLUE. But C, the last delegate from BLUE, is on a completely different provider.\n\nThis other URL voting provider could allow C to delegate to a list of all Nobel laureates or @mit neuroscientists. This provider could integrate with @wikidata to confirm their occupation, alma mater and awards — like my old side project [agreelist.org](http://agreelist.org)\n\nOr this URL voting provider could be @a16z which — as @_jamico explains — already delegates half of their voting tokens <https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program>\n\nOr one of the delegates on the URL voting provider could be AI-assisted or completely autonomous like @cesifoti's augmented democracy @ted talk <https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_hidalgo_a_bold_idea_to_replace_politicians>\n\nTo mitigate risks, delegations could end a few days before the direct voting.\n\nAnd your URL voting provider could end AI-assisted delegates before human delegates.\n\nThat way people could always be alerted and override votes from delegates.\n\nTo sum up, if we implement direct+representative+augmented voting for DAOs we could:\n\n1. Make better decisions\n2. Increase the number of people who can effectively collaborate in decentralized organisations\n\nAnd this is important because of what the MIT Professor Alex Pentland said:\n\n> The biggest problem in the world is not climate change, war or poverty, but how we organise among ourselves to make good decisions and carry them out\n\nWhat do you think?

E.g. my-voting-provider.com/user\n\nThen, the js code of the strategy would fetch something like my-voting-provider.com/user/space/proposal to know a vote.\n\nThese voting URLs would have no authentication. Anyone could see on my-voting-provider.com/USER/space/proposal would see the vote of the representative USER.\n\nThese URL voting providers are composable.\n\nFor example, provider1.com/BLUE could delegate to the following list:\n\n1. provider1.com/A\n2. provider1.com/B\n3. provider2.com/C\n\nIn the previous example, provider1 could also let BLUE vote directly.\n\nSo if BLUE doesn't vote but A does, BLUE would vote as A regardless of B and C. If BLUE and A don't vote but B does, BLUE would vote as B regardless of C. But if B doesn't vote either, do as C says.\n\nConsider that BLUE, A and B are from the same URL voting provider, but C doesn't.\n\nThis means that A and B can use delegation list + override like BLUE.

This provider could integrate with @wikidata to confirm their occupation, alma mater and awards — like my old side project [agreelist.org](http://agreelist.org)\n\nOr this URL voting provider could be a16z which [already delegates half of their voting tokens](https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program).\n\nOr one of the delegates on the URL voting provider could be AI-assisted or completely autonomous like [César Hidalgo’s augmented democracy TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_hidalgo_a_bold_idea_to_replace_politicians).\n\nTo mitigate risks, delegations could end a few days before the direct voting.\n\nAnd your URL voting provider could end AI-assisted delegates before human delegates.\n\nThat way people could always be alerted and override votes from delegates.\n\nTo sum up, if we implement direct+representative+augmented voting for DAOs we could:\n\n1. Make better decisions\n2. Increase the number of people who can effectively collaborate in decentralized organisations\n\nAnd this is important because of what the MIT Professor Alex Pentland said:\n\n> *The biggest problem in the world is not climate change, war or poverty, but how we organise among ourselves to make good decisions and carry them out.*\n\nWhat do you think?

To make better decisions\n2. To increase the number of people who can effectively collaborate in decentralized organisations\n\nMany DAOs such as ENS, Decentraland and Proof of Humanity use [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org/) for off-chain voting.\n\nThese DAOs choose one or more [voting strategies](https://docs.snapshot.org/strategies/what-is-a-strategy) on Snapshot.\n\nA voting strategy on Snapshot that would enable direct+representative+augmented voting would allow eth addresses to delegate to a URL. E.g. my-voting-provider.com/user\n\nThen, the js code of the strategy would fetch something like my-voting-provider.com/user/space/proposal to know a vote.\n\nThese voting URLs would have no authentication. Anyone could see on my-voting-provider.com/USER/space/proposal would see the vote of the representative USER.\n\nThese URL voting providers are composable.\n\nFor example, provider1.com/BLUE could delegate to the following list:\n\n1. provider1.com/A\n2. provider1.com/B\n3. provider2.com/C\n\nIn the previous example, provider1 could also let BLUE vote directly.\n\nSo if BLUE doesn't vote but A does, BLUE would vote as A regardless of B and C. If BLUE and A don't vote but B does, BLUE would vote as B regardless of C. But if B doesn't vote either, do as C says.\n\nConsider that BLUE, A and B are from the same URL voting provider, but C doesn't.\n\nThis means that A and B can use delegation list + override like BLUE. But C, the last delegate from BLUE, is on a completely different provider.\n\nThis other URL voting provider could allow C to delegate to a list of all Nobel laureates or MIT neuroscientists. This provider could integrate with Wikidata/Wikipedia to confirm their occupation, alma mater and awards — like my old side project [agreelist.org](http://agreelist.org/)\n\nOr this URL voting provider could be a16z which [already delegates half of their voting tokens](https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program).\n\nOr one of the delegates on the URL voting provider could be AI-assisted or completely autonomous like [César Hidalgo’s augmented democracy TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_hidalgo_a_bold_idea_to_replace_politicians).\n\nTo mitigate risks, delegations could end a few days before the direct voting.\n\nAnd your URL voting provider could end AI-assisted delegates before human delegates.\n\nThat way people could always be alerted and override votes from delegates.\n\nTo sum up, if we implement direct+representative+augmented voting for DAOs we could:\n\n1.

A mahogany dresser guarded the foot of the bed. In the dresser mirror, that was visible over our toes, I saw the reflection of a crucifix hanging on the wall above our heads.\n\nI lit a cigarette and used an empty coffee mug for an ashtray. I exhaled a tower of smoke that reached the ceiling and flattened out like a gray pancake.\n\n\"What do you think about living together?\" I said.\n\nShe seemed taken aback.\n\n\"What you think?\" I said.\n\n\"I...I don't know. Do you really want to live with me?\"\n\nI dabbed my cigarette butt against the inner wall of the coffee mug.\n\n\"Leah,\" I said, and suddenly I felt as if I was running down a long diving board above a pool, and as the next words left my mouth, it felt like I jumped. \"I've never wanted anything more in my life,\" I said, and then I launched, one toe away from flight, letting gravity take over.\n\nShe blinked. \"Here?\"\n\n\"No,\" I shook my head. \"My place. I don't want you paying for anything.\"\n\n\"I can't let you…do that,\" she said.\n\n\"I want to,\" I squeezed her hand.\n\n\"But your roommate...\"\n\n\"I'll give him time to find a new place,\" I reached over to my pants from the floor. I pulled out my set of keys from the pocket. On the coiled ring were two keys to my apartment, and a tiny key for my mailbox. I slid one of the apartment keys off the ring and handed it to Leah in a grand gesture. \"It’s yours,\" I said.\n\nA smile crept onto her lips, gradually. She squeezed the key in her fist and raised it to her chest. \"Okay,\" she nodded.\n\nWe kissed, and excitement amplified my senses. I smelled her natural scent, I heard ringing in my ears, I felt her arm loop around me, dragging my body tight against hers, and I let thoughts of our future wash over me.\n\n\n---\n\nContinued on **[Posted on May 7](https://mirror.xyz/everyoneandnoone.eth/OS4tM4D4ELskH5hUeEmYVmQ0hrXcF7bJl6lCZp04dTI)**", "timestamp": 1656090663, "digest": "lbbwOjVvPEH_yHa8pcZRk9skOVLVEsMj-ulfCUVCSxg", "contributor": "0xB94FbeEc03C1c33899e2b22F28AaeeCF6026a7cD"}

It was late at night. I didn't remember the last time I saw William. Days maybe? Weeks? I wondered if he was home, and then I heard his bed creak in his room. Sitting on the sofa, I burnt through two cigarettes thinking about how I would tell him.\n\n\"William!\" I shouted.\n\nI heard feet shuffling from behind his door. William stepped out holding the neck of a rum bottle. His hair was a mess and he looked like he hadn't showered for days. I motioned for him to sit beside me.\n\nHe sat down, reeking of liquor. His white t-shirt was stained with amber wet spots. I butted out my cigarette and exhaled the smoke through my nose.\n\n\"Well?\" he slurred.\n\n\"Something’s come up,\" I said.\n\n\"Really now?\" William's drunken voice was drenched in sarcasm.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, uncomfortable.\n\n\"Let me guess, I need to move out.\" \n\n\"What?\" I was taken aback. I looked at him strangely, even scared. \"Yes...how did you...\"\n\nHe shot back a swig. \"Want some?\" He pushed the bottle into my face.\n\n\"Listen, let's talk in the morning, when you're sober,\" I said, still baffled.\n\n\"So, it’s finally happenin’,\" William stopped me from getting up.\n\nHe thumped the bottle loud on the coffee table.\n\n\"Can I have a smoke?\" William extended his hand to me.\n\nI handed him a cigarette and my Zippo. He placed the cigarette backwards in his mouth, the filter pointing outwards.\n\n\"It's backwards,\" I said, but it was too late. He lit the filter.\n\nHe studied the ruined cigarette in his fingers, broke it in half and threw it at the ashtray, missing it. \"Got another one?\"\n\nI gave him a second one, and he did the same thing.\n\n\"My mistake,\" he reached out his hand to me again. I hesitated. I gave him a third cigarette. He put it in his mouth upside down again.\n\n\"It's backwards,\" I said.\n\nHe stared me down for a long time before lighting the filter end.\n\n\"I'm going to bed,\" I stood up, and then he pushed me from behind. My shins hit the coffee table and I tumbled onto the carpet. I rolled over onto my back and saw William standing over me. He brought his knee down into my stomach. I struggled to sit up, but he was too strong. He pressed my head against the floor. The sound of my Zippo sparked beside my ear.\n\n\"Get off me!\" I bucked my hips and pushed at his chest.\n\n\"You want me gone?\" he grunted, his breath reeking.\n\nI felt the heat of the flame near my ear. Orange glowed in my peripheral vision.\n\nWilliam's breathing quickened. Suddenly, he looked nauseous, and pressed his lips together. He gagged, and slapped his hand over his mouth. I heard the Zippo shut, and I sucked in a breath of relief as William released his knee off my stomach and rushed to the washroom.\n\nI heard William puking. I thought about grabbing a knife from the kitchen. But instead, I didn't move, lying in shock. I wheezed, confusion swirling in my mind.\n\nWilliam returned, still wobbling, his eyes drowsy. \"Get up,\" he offered his hand but I didn't take it. \n\nI shot him a suspicious glare.\n\nHe sat back on the sofa, shaking his head. \"I don't know what came over me.”\n\nHe chugged down more rum, and suddenly, his face was different.\n\n\"I don't want to go,\" he said. But he wasn't looking at me. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \"No. I'm not goin’.\" He seemed to be talking more to himself than to me. He swung back the rest of the rum and took the empty bottle with him into his room.\n\nI lied there, staring at the whiteness of the ceiling for so long that my eyes blurred, and my mind strained to make sense of everything that just happened.\n\nIn my room, the bottle of pills lied sideways on the floor beside the mattress. Bending over, I swiped it up and headed to the bathroom.\n\nStanding over the sink, I dropped two pills into my palm and turned on the faucet. I paused, staring down at the pills in my hand, the sound of running water echoing off the tiled walls. I turned off the faucet and tossed the pills into the toilet. I flushed, watching the pills spin in circles before disappearing.\n\nOpening the medicine cabinet, I placed the bottle of pills beside a box of band-aids on the top shelf and made a promise to myself never to take the pills again.\n\nWith my hands leaning on the edge of the sink, staring at my reflection in the mirror, I thought about storming into William’s room and kicking him out. I wanted him out that same night. I wanted to wake up in the morning to see him gone.\n\n\n---\n\nContinued on **Posted on May 8** dropping next noon.

To make better decisions\n2. To increase the number of people who can effectively collaborate in decentralized organisations\n\nMany DAOs such as ENS, Decentraland and Proof of Humanity use [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org/) for off-chain voting.\n\nThese DAOs choose one or more [voting strategies](https://docs.snapshot.org/strategies/what-is-a-strategy) on Snapshot.\n\nA voting strategy on Snapshot that would enable direct+representative+augmented voting would allow eth addresses to delegate to a URL. E.g. my-voting-provider.com/user\n\nThen, the js code of the strategy would fetch something like my-voting-provider.com/user/space/proposal to know a vote.\n\nThese voting URLs would have no authentication. Anyone could see on my-voting-provider.com/USER/space/proposal would see the vote of the representative USER.\n\nThese URL voting providers are composable.\n\nFor example, provider1.com/BLUE could delegate to the following list:\n\n1. provider1.com/A\n2. provider1.com/B\n3. provider2.com/C\n\nIn the previous example, provider1 could also let BLUE vote directly.\n\nSo if BLUE doesn't vote but A does, BLUE would vote as A regardless of B and C. If BLUE and A don't vote but B does, BLUE would vote as B regardless of C. But if B doesn't vote either, do as C says.\n\nConsider that BLUE, A and B are from the same URL voting provider, but C doesn't.\n\nThis means that A and B can use delegation list + override like BLUE. But C, the last delegate from BLUE, is on a completely different provider.\n\nThis other URL voting provider could allow C to delegate to a list of all Nobel laureates or MIT neuroscientists. This provider could integrate with Wikidata/Wikipedia to confirm their occupation, alma mater and awards — like my old side project [agreelist.org](http://agreelist.org/)\n\nOr this URL voting provider could be a16z which [already delegates half of their voting tokens](https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program).\n\nOr one of the delegates on the URL voting provider could be AI-assisted or completely autonomous like [César Hidalgo’s augmented democracy TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_hidalgo_a_bold_idea_to_replace_politicians).\n\nTo mitigate risks, delegations could end a few days before the direct voting.\n\nAnd your URL voting provider could end AI-assisted delegates before human delegates.\n\nThat way people could always be alerted and override votes from delegates.\n\nTo sum up, if we implement direct+representative+augmented voting for DAOs we could:\n\n1. Make better decisions\n2. Increase the number of people who can effectively collaborate in decentralized organisations\n\nAnd this is important because of what the MIT Professor Alex Pentland said:\n\n> *The biggest problem in the world is not climate change, war or poverty, but how we organise among ourselves to make good decisions and carry them out.*\n\nWhat do you think?

By providing tools and alliance management services, Rent Responsibly equips local leaders to build successful, self-sustaining organizations of STR hosts, managers and all other stakeholders in their communities.\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover why we partnered with Rent Responsibly, how the partnership benefits the Dtravel ecosystem and how you can get involved.\n\n## Aligned Principles Key to Partnership\n\nRent Responsibly’s mission of bringing STR stakeholders together to empower them through knowledge sharing and the formation of local alliances is particularly aligned with our own principles.\n\nAt Dtravel, one of our primary goals is to fundamentally change what it means to be part of an STR community. We’re doing this by increasing ownership and encouraging greater direct involvement in the ecosystem through unrivaled decision-making power and influence for community members.\n\nThere are many aspects of STR hosting, and Dtravel is just one piece of the puzzle. Other considerations such as tax, insurance and property care are something that all hosts must inevitably deal with, and with a variety of conflicting advice strewn throughout the internet, joining STR alliances through Rent Responsibly is an inclusive way for hosts to connect with each other, regardless of whether they’re just getting started or looking to improve their established offering.\n\nIt’s important to recognize that the business of STR hosting is complex and can be daunting due to factors such as various STR regulations and tax legislation. Through partners like Dtravel, Rent Responsibly makes it easy for members to collaborate, solve common challenges, advocate and steward their communities.\n\nSince Dtravel utilizes web3 technologies that will be relatively new to many hosts, it’s especially important that we continue to educate hosts on how to use our product and the benefits that come with it — and what better way to do it than in the company of other incredible STR businesses working to enhance the hosting experience.\n\n## Benefits of the Partnership\n\nAs part of a select 2022 cohort comprising ten partners, the partnership puts a spotlight on Dtravel, highlighting our unique ecosystem to STR alliances across the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n\nThis opportunity will help generate interest from hosts who are passionate about a sustainable future for the STR industry, with the potential to increase the supply of Dtravel listings as a result.\n\nThe partnership will enable us to leverage the incredible work that Rent Responsibly has done to date by tapping into their rapidly growing database of tens of thousands of owners, hosts and property managers to share educational videos, advertisements and newsletter content with an engaged, high-quality audience.\n\nAlongside the brand and marketing potential associated with the partnership, we’ll also be able to expand our communication channels through speaking spots at quarterly virtual events, participation in biannual demo days and introductions to industry connections.\n\nThere are also a number of upcoming initiatives by the team to further drive traffic to Dtravel by assisting hosts and property managers to conveniently discover helpful STR products and service providers.\n\n## Register for the RR Summit for FREE\n\nEarlier this week, Rent Responsibly also unveiled their inaugural RR Summit, a two-day virtual conference taking place 12–13 July 2022, free to all STR owners across the globe.\n\nThe summit will feature 16 educational sessions with 2022 partners, Rent Responsibly staff and expert guest speakers. Topics will range from implementing smart practices to leveling up operations, navigating local laws, scaling sustainably, beating burnout and more.\n\nKeynote sessions will include a fireside chat with HomeAway co-founder Carl Shepherd and a Founders of the Future panel discussion.\n\nWe’ll be speaking on the second day of the summit about web3 being the future of direct bookings, so be sure to tune in then!\n\n[Register for the RR Summit](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/rr-summit-paths-to-professionalization/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=partner_dtravel)\n\nFor hosts looking to take advantage of Rent Responsibly’s back catalog of useful content, check out their [Resource Library](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/resources/) for guides, webinars and host learnings that provide valuable insights into a variety of topics.\n\n## Join the Community\n\n[Website](https://www.dtravel.com/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DtravelDAO) | [Telegram](https://t.me/dtravelcommunity) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dtravel)", "timestamp": 1656091206, "digest": "ylUfkVpTzYBfqidg8a1d7lQJDK33syHoG1AfUEMYuk0", "contributor": "0xae3565a8b566ebe2a99c6ca30f498c2b0DDF2196"}

What are the products / services / features that you MUST have to migrate away from TradFi and into the Web3 ecosystem?

I’ll approach these selfishly for my own desired use cases, but I also think this MVBoC will be broadly applicable and help to drive adoption of Web3. My MVBoC will be different than other users, but hopefully covers enough surface area to get prospective users exploring the ecosystem more productively.\n\n### Reasonable fiat on-ramp\n\nDepending on the Centralized Exchange (“CEX”) used, transaction fees and spread fees can cost anywhere from 0.4%-2.0%+. There is an additional fee to transfer tokens to a self custody wallet. Most CEXs currently only transfer to ETH mainnet (within the [Ethereum](https://twitter.com/ethereum) ecosystem), so if you prefer to operate on L2s ([Optimism](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC), [Arbitrum](https://twitter.com/arbitrum), etc.) there are additional bridging fees. These fees add up quickly and are quite steep when compared to my typical monthly fees of $0.00 or 0% in TradFi.\n\nIf I plan to bring assets on chain and make monthly payments for goods or services while still receiving some yield, I need to cover that 2.0% fee with offsetting yield just to break even, which implies I can find a dApp or DeFi protocol with an APY of 27.3% and assumes I don’t have to off-ramp the assets. This level of yield is not easy to find, especially with low risk.\n\nAlternatively, I could break even (fees paid vs yield earned) if I earn yield at a lower rate over multiple months on savings or surplus assets, but I don’t think that is an assumption that should be made given many prospective global users don’t have savings sitting idle and would therefore be excluded from using the network economically.\n\n### Direct deposit options\n\nMy current employer does not enable direct deposit into crypto, so I have not been able to experiment with this option. I know some options do exist (e.g., [OnJuno](https://onjuno.onelink.me/TkoI/referral?code=5KQBLTXZ)), but until I can actually test and follow the cash to see all of the fees I’ll abstain from speaking to the economics. I suspect that there is a fee structure similar to the CEX fiat on-ramp for using these services to swap from fiat based paycheck into Cryptocurrencies.\n\nIdeally, employers would start to adopt $USDC / $DAI / $BTC / $ETH, etc., and pay compensation directly in these tokens so fiat conversion and transfer fees can be avoided altogether.\n\n### Yield on assets\n\nLets briefly set aside fees and focus on yield. It appears we’re about to exit a 20-30 year period of abnormally low interest rates and time will tell what the impact is to retail user account interest rate yield. I suspect that since retail users are well conditioned to receive near zero yield on their deposits and TradFi has a lot of power over retail users (i.e., access to a financial system is useful and switching TradFi banks is a pain), I don’t expect to see meaningful increases to retail user account interest rates even as market rates rise. Incumbent TradFi banks may compete based on retail account interest rates, but I’m suspicious retail will noticeably benefit (benefits likely will go to preferred customers, e.g., high net worth individuals, corporations, financial institutions, etc.).\n\nHowever, the compounding effect of interest over any extended period of time is powerful. To illustrate an extreme case, the following chart displays 30 year growth of $1,000 USD (but could be applied to 1,000 of any units).\n\n![Growth of $1,000 over 30 years compounded daily. TradFi interest APY of 0.75%, Pre Ethereum merge incremental APY of 4.5%, Post Ethereum merge incremental APY of 9.0%.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/84w36qFZOR1Z91jOdja8s.png?height=616&width=758)\n\nIn practice, users will likely redeploy at least some amount of interest earned for other purposes, but the chart above helps to frame the magnitude of value capture that is in play.\n\nThe principle bar is constant at $1,000 throughout. The TradFi interest bar compounds to a total of $251 or 25% (at 0.75% APY, my current savings account interest rate) over 30 years. Pre merge incremental compounds to a total of $2,494 or 249% (at 3.75% APY, 4.5% APY excluding 0.75% APY from TradFi) over 30 years. Post merge incremental compounds to a total of $9,521 or 952% (at 4.5% APY, 9.0% APY excluding 3.75% APY on pre merge incremental and 0.75% APY from TradFi) over 30 years.\n\nI will break this down in more detail in a future post and the pre and post merge vernacular could be substituted for any sources of stacked or leveraged yield, but the way I think about this is as of right now retail users are giving the gray and yellow bars to TradFi in return for products and services provided. I’m optimistic that as more activity migrates on chain, idle capital can be staked to earn yield for liquidity pools, network level PoS security, peer to smart contract lending, and likely many other use cases.\n\nI do ascribe some value to the products and services TradFi provides, but that seems like a lot to pay for services which haven’t changed much in my lifetime (especially when Web3 is progressing towards high quality decentralized alternative products and services).\n\nThis example does assume that TradFi banks can earn a net interest margin of 8.25% (9.0% less 0.75%). Based on some [quick research](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061715/what-net-interest-margin-typical-bank.asp), it looks like net interest margins in recent years are closer to 3%-4% on average, though there are some individual institutions in the high single digits.\n\n### Settlement of key payments\n\nIn a given month, my household cash outflows are probably 90%+ contained in three transactions: (i) mortgage and property tax payment, (ii) car payment, and (iii) credit card payment. I’m sure this is not the same for many potential Crypto users, but I do think focusing on (i) disbursement or settlement of monthly rent / mortgage, (ii) transportation (vehicle or public transit), and (iii) credit card payments significantly limits the number of entities Crypto would need to embed with (i.e., you don’t have to go for the long tail of every point of sale storefront). Focusing on these high dollar value low frequency events would significantly reduce the number of transactions that need to be settled and keep network congestion low as on chain activities continue to scale.\n\nI suspect this is a challenging strategic task as TradFi has their hands all over these three events and will likely be against change. That said, there are no doubt opportunities to get started, for example TradFi has outsourced a lot of mortgage servicing to third parties and many rental property management companies are using or could likely use software platforms to receive rent payments. Integration with these types of non TradFi or TradFi adjacent companies to enable Crypto rails for settlement could be very productive. I was recently targeted on Twitter by an organization called [Spritz Financial](https://www.spritz.finance/) which appears to be working towards this goal and will be in beta soon.\n\nIf a solution could be sorted out where I could use on chain tokens to settle these three payments monthly, I would continue to move more of my assets on chain. Similarly, If I am able to receive direct deposits in a minimized fee environment and settle key payments in a minimized fee environment, the headwind of a fiat on-ramp and off-ramp are also minimized or possibly obsolete.\n\nThis approach is obviously imperfect in both the short and long term as (i) many users aren’t able to get a TradFi credit card and would still have to fund a lot of financial activity via TradFi cash withdrawals, debit cards, checks, etc., and (ii) use of a TradFi credit card as a key tool still subjects users to a permissioned financial system via legacy payment rails.\n\nA quick aside, I have seen some product offerings leveraging Visa or other legacy point of sale rails bundled with Crypto entities. I am suspicious of this long term as (i) settlement still requires permission from a centralized entity (e.g., Visa), (ii) swap rates and fees will likely be overly punitive to retail users, and (iii) the more embedded Crypto gets with these centralized permissioned TradFi entities the tougher it will be to roll out Crypto native point of sale rails in the future.\n\n### Reasonable fiat off-ramp\n\nTo complete the fiat on-ramp fee example previously noted, if an off-ramp is required to settle payments for goods or services, one month break even yield increases to 61.2%. This level of yield is nearly impossible to find.\n\nTo drive the point home on the relationship between fees and yield, here are a couple illustrations of yields and break even points.\n\n![Assumes 3.0% APY compounded daily, which is generally achievable in stable coin liquidity pools and is less than liquid ETH staking. Ramp fees of 2.0% displayed in the matrix above is applied both at the on-ramp and off-ramp, independently (i.e., 2.0% fee at time of on-ramp, and a 2.0% fee at time of off-ramp)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8HlxOElJBZh6kKL-tY7xp.png?height=183&width=495)\n\nThe table above illustrates the total yield generated based on (i) 3.0% APY (not easy to find in TradFi), (ii) various levels of ramp fees (down the column on the left), and (iii) different time horizons of leaving assets unused and accruing interest. For example, 1.2% ramp fees and funds held for 365 days at 3.0% constant APY compounded daily produces a total yield of 0.5% on capital round tripped onto and off of chain. Pretty straight forward and I don’t suspect any outputs stimulate much of a reaction. Lets look at the same analysis presented on an annualized rate basis.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xkLQqSr2XGGWKMteG1mH0.png?height=185&width=495)\n\nThe lower the fees and the further out in time you go within the matrix, annualized yield will start to converge on the 3.0% APY, which should not be surprising. What may be surprising to many is the annualized loss suffered by users when the on-ramp / off-ramp fees are high and users aren’t able to park assets for long periods of time to earn yield. If users attempt to use Crypto as a replacement for TradFi banks, pay fiat on ramp fees, earn yield for 15-30 days, and then take those assets off chain or settle a payment on chain, and do this every month as many users do in TradFi…there will be a lot of upset users essentially experiencing credit card or payday loan level fees.\n\nThis is a significant barrier to increased use for me. Even if there wasn’t 6-20 day round trip to bring assets on chain and then get back into TradFi to buy goods or services off chain, the fees for on-ramp and off-ramp are too punitive for everyday use. This won’t be solved by any L2 or Alt L1 scaling solutions that reduce on chain fees. This likely is not a focus for many current users as speculation or much longer term investment horizons can absorb these gatekeeper fees, but I think to realize the network effects that I’d love to see there will need to be a solution for this issue.\n\nOne additional visualization I find useful is to look at how long it takes (in days) to break even (yield earned covers fees) based on the relationship between ramp fees and APY at various levels\n\n![Ramp fees of 2.0% displayed in the matrix above is applied both at the on-ramp and off-ramp, independently (i.e., 2.0% fee at time of on-ramp, and a 2.0% fee at time of off-ramp)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3zE-M2-CGKzfl-dtV2uKB.png?height=184&width=495)\n\nIf a user can find 20.0% APY with just a 0.4% on-ramp and off-ramp fee (e.g., typical of [FTX](https://join.robinhood.com/kyler-6840b716/) and [Robinhood](https://join.robinhood.com/kyler-6840b716) based on observed opaque spread fee), the user will hit break even in 18 days and begin to accrue positive net yield thereafter. This assumes zero on chain fees.\n\nAlternatively, if a user can only find 2.0% APY, and uses a higher fee CEX (e.g., typical [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/23062G?src=ios-link) fees are 1.5% transaction fee and 0.5% opaque spread fee), the user won’t cover the on-ramp and off-ramp fees until 753 days. This assumes zero on chain fees.\n\n### MVBoC use case summary\n\nDon’t get me wrong…I enjoy figuring out how to stake ETH into stETH, borrow ETH against that stETH to stake into more stETH, then do it two more times to get from 4% APY up to 8% APY…and given on-ramp fees, transaction fees, and off-ramp fees I need to lock up for six plus months to break even…and hope the centralized platform I’ve given custody to doesn’t freeze withdrawals…but I personally think the velocity of adoption will only start to move meaningfully when some basic common sense use cases are ready for broad use.\n\nI highly doubt this is lost on many folks in the ecosystem and I know much of the focus even up to current day has been on foundational network infrastructure, but selfishly I hope leaders in the space think the time is right to focus on these fundamental challenges instead of other shiny object style dApps. Shiny objects are cool, but they’re not for everyone or even most people.\n\nIf I’m able to settle all of my major monthly payments on chain, I’d be willing to move significantly more of my financial assets on chain and even receive Web0-Web2 employment compensation direct deposited on chain. It’s not sexy, but I think it would be a compelling narrative to get prospective users interested.\n\nIdeally, the fiat on-ramp and off-ramp requirements essentially go away in the near term as more settlement activities move on chain. The definition of “reasonable” is subjective, but I think the fees to get assets on and off chain for general use shouldn’t be greater than the yield earned in a short period of time (e.g., less than a month. Otherwise, why bring them on chain at all other than purely to speculate?).\n\nMy hope is that the Web3 ecosystem starts to move more towards a money system instead of a speculation engine as developer time refocuses to dApps once L1s, L2s, and network security are on solid ground. \n\nA future state where point of sale settlement occurs on crypto native rails is ideal, but doesn’t seem like a the most productive first step in my opinion to make meaningful progress towards a blockchain money system and to onboard the next billion users.\n\n\n---\n\nAbout the This Web3 Life collection:\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0xdb92c5C91a5D81Bd9865a07A42c7dD3F35bDA225/PMr7U1cp5LhxphP7bsSDg0kQYpEoPlirE0EN8kdg90c](https://mirror.xyz/0xdb92c5C91a5D81Bd9865a07A42c7dD3F35bDA225/PMr7U1cp5LhxphP7bsSDg0kQYpEoPlirE0EN8kdg90c)\n\nAbout rasmuky:\n\n[https://mirror.xyz/0xdb92c5C91a5D81Bd9865a07A42c7dD3F35bDA225/lnFQ5wj4FfNKK0wcyOYt974y-9lnaD3M-iUAqS1bRe4](https://mirror.xyz/0xdb92c5C91a5D81Bd9865a07A42c7dD3F35bDA225/lnFQ5wj4FfNKK0wcyOYt974y-9lnaD3M-iUAqS1bRe4)\n\n[https://twitter.com/rasmuky](https://twitter.com/rasmuky)\n\n[https://linktr.ee/rasmuky](https://linktr.ee/rasmuky)\n\n", "timestamp": 1656091227, "digest": "MhuHODsTGyaLW2D3KbB3NKBX2HMcbJy-nvqlOIHylvA", "contributor": "0xdb92c5C91a5D81Bd9865a07A42c7dD3F35bDA225"}
{"id": "ASWWPF9KdPE3aLBCA91gfxI92gkWBZhQuMCeVM0Y8VE", "title": "Dtravel Partners with Rent Responsibly\n", "body": "This week, Rent Responsibly [announced its newest 2022 partners](https://au.news.yahoo.com/rent-responsibly-announces-2022-partners-130000608.html), with Dtravel proudly named alongside nine other partners, including Expedia Group, NoiseAware and Breezeway.\n\n[Rent Responsibly](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/) is a community-building and education platform for local short-term rental (STR) alliances. By providing tools and alliance management services, Rent Responsibly equips local leaders to build successful, self-sustaining organizations of STR hosts, managers and all other stakeholders in their communities.\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover why we partnered with Rent Responsibly, how the partnership benefits the Dtravel ecosystem and how you can get involved.\n\n## Aligned Principles Key to Partnership\n\nRent Responsibly’s mission of bringing STR stakeholders together to empower them through knowledge sharing and the formation of local alliances is particularly aligned with our own principles.\n\nAt Dtravel, one of our primary goals is to fundamentally change what it means to be part of an STR community. We’re doing this by increasing ownership and encouraging greater direct involvement in the ecosystem through unrivaled decision-making power and influence for community members.\n\nThere are many aspects of STR hosting, and Dtravel is just one piece of the puzzle. Other considerations such as tax, insurance and property care are something that all hosts must inevitably deal with, and with a variety of conflicting advice strewn throughout the internet, joining STR alliances through Rent Responsibly is an inclusive way for hosts to connect with each other, regardless of whether they’re just getting started or looking to improve their established offering.\n\nIt’s important to recognize that the business of STR hosting is complex and can be daunting due to factors such as various STR regulations and tax legislation. Through partners like Dtravel, Rent Responsibly makes it easy for members to collaborate, solve common challenges, advocate and steward their communities.\n\nSince Dtravel utilizes web3 technologies that will be relatively new to many hosts, it’s especially important that we continue to educate hosts on how to use our product and the benefits that come with it — and what better way to do it than in the company of other incredible STR businesses working to enhance the hosting experience.\n\n## Benefits of the Partnership\n\nAs part of a select 2022 cohort comprising ten partners, the partnership puts a spotlight on Dtravel, highlighting our unique ecosystem to STR alliances across the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n\nThis opportunity will help generate interest from hosts who are passionate about a sustainable future for the STR industry, with the potential to increase the supply of Dtravel listings as a result.\n\nThe partnership will enable us to leverage the incredible work that Rent Responsibly has done to date by tapping into their rapidly growing database of tens of thousands of owners, hosts and property managers to share educational videos, advertisements and newsletter content with an engaged, high-quality audience.\n\nAlongside the brand and marketing potential associated with the partnership, we’ll also be able to expand our communication channels through speaking spots at quarterly virtual events, participation in biannual demo days and introductions to industry connections.\n\nThere are also a number of upcoming initiatives by the team to further drive traffic to Dtravel by assisting hosts and property managers to conveniently discover helpful STR products and service providers.\n\n## Register for the RR Summit for FREE\n\nEarlier this week, Rent Responsibly also unveiled their inaugural RR Summit, a two-day virtual conference taking place 12–13 July 2022, free to all STR owners across the globe.\n\nThe summit will feature 16 educational sessions with 2022 partners, Rent Responsibly staff and expert guest speakers. Topics will range from implementing smart practices to leveling up operations, navigating local laws, scaling sustainably, beating burnout and more.\n\nKeynote sessions will include a fireside chat with HomeAway co-founder Carl Shepherd and a Founders of the Future panel discussion.\n\nWe’ll be speaking on the second day of the summit about web3 being the future of direct bookings, so be sure to tune in then!\n\n[Register for the RR Summit](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/rr-summit-paths-to-professionalization/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=partner_dtravel)\n\nFor hosts looking to take advantage of Rent Responsibly’s back catalog of useful content, check out their [Resource Library](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/resources/) for guides, webinars and host learnings that provide valuable insights into a variety of topics.\n\n## Join the Community\n\n[Website](https://www.dtravel.com/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DtravelDAO) | [Telegram](https://t.me/dtravelcommunity) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dtravel)", "timestamp": 1656091813, "digest": "ylUfkVpTzYBfqidg8a1d7lQJDK33syHoG1AfUEMYuk0", "contributor": "0xae3565a8b566ebe2a99c6ca30f498c2b0DDF2196"}

前言\n\n开门见山，无论是web2还是web3，我们所需要的是参与进来可以分一勺汤，任何一个时代的来临都将会给一批人空前绝后的机会，目前市场行情低迷，推特各种社区交流甚少，大盘不断下跌，亏得韭菜们也是心情低落，互相谩骂，厮打，甚至一些大佬也是闲来无事，互相撕逼。机会就在眼前，时代的发展势不可挡，我倒是觉得web3时代在逆境中成长更好，所以我决定一定要把握住当下这次空前绝后的机会，也许再错过你就老了。这个周期有可能一年，五年，十年。不过你终究会暴富。\n\n不废话，今日更新web3项目都需要你的认真对待，多说无用，直接上整理分析。\n\n**1；Project Galaxy ☰**\n\n融资情况；1000万\n\n是否发币；是\n\n项目评级；★★★★★\n\n项目官网；\n\n[https://galaxy.eco/](https://galaxy.eco/)\n\n项目推特；\n\n[https://twitter.com/ProjectGalaxyHQ](https://twitter.com/ProjectGalaxyHQ)\n\n项目介绍；一个协作的凭证基础设施，使品牌能够在 Web3 中建立更好的社区和产品。它们是构成您的数字身份的活动、声誉和成就的记录。根据您在多个区块链上的凭证探索奖励，简单说就是从一个银河女孩的NFT被大家所熟知。后期越来越多的项目在Project Galaxy ☰上面开展活动，用户也是急速增长，就在前两个月发币了，一路跟过来的朋友已经吃到肉了，并且这块肉还很香，你希望下一个吃肉的是你么？请接着往下看，机会就在下面。\n\n空投策略；虽然已发币，但是上面的活动完成会得到一些ATO和NFT奖励，ATO目前赋能还不知道是什么，但是NFT奖励有大有小，关注一些困难的大项目跟着做下来还是有毛的。\n\n**2；RabbitHole**\n\n融资情况；1800万\n\n是否发币；否（官方明确不会发币）\n\n项目评级；★★★★★\n\n项目官网；\n\n[https://rabbithole.gg/](https://rabbithole.gg/)\n\n项目推特；\n\n[https://twitter.com/rabbithole_gg](https://twitter.com/rabbithole_gg)\n\n项目介绍；了解如何使用和贡献去中心化应用程序，根据您的链上活动赚取代币。获得证明您掌握核心技能和协议的链上证书。通过撰写提案、创作艺术品或开发子图来为 RabbitHole 工作，并获得独特的奖励。\n\n空投策略；虽然已经明确不发币，但是所列出的任务值得我们学习web3的基础知识，偶尔还会有一些小惊喜和意外，但是建议ETH的GAS低时候去完成，毕竟成本太高了不合适，因为小惊喜也是存在不确定性。\n\n**3；CyberConnect**\n\n融资情况；1500万\n\n是否发币；否（官方暗示以后会发币）\n\n项目评级；★★★★★\n\n项目官网；\n\n[https://cyberconnect.me/](https://cyberconnect.me/)\n\n项目推特；\n\n[https://twitter.com/CyberConnectHQ](https://twitter.com/CyberConnectHQ)\n\n项目介绍；一种去中心化的社交图谱协议，将数据所有权返还给用户，并帮助开发人员构建强大的 web3 社交应用程序。生态系统中很多合作的项目，属于很有发展前景web3社交项目的一个。只是网页个人不是很喜欢。\n\n空投策略；前一段时间大家都在刷互相关注，不过明确的讲确实需要粉丝的基础你才可以在web3时代发展的更强大，所以互相关注是埋伏空投的前提之一，慢慢的生态项目变大以后，在discord里面的中文频道钉选里面可见一些小任务，AMA等等，都是有奖励的，并且有些是在银河的入口一起其他web3的入口进入，所以目前最主要所做的就是互相关注，在discord里面找钉选任务公布并去完成。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Y5pATQxIE--mngQTHpX9h.png?height=822&width=403)\n\n**4；LensProtocol.lens**\n\n融资情况；无\n\n是否发币；否（很有发展前景的一个web3生态大项目，需要持续跟踪成长）\n\n项目评级；★★★★★\n\n项目官网；\n\n[https://lens.xyz/](https://lens.xyz/)\n\n项目推特；\n\n[https://twitter.com/LensProtocol](https://twitter.com/LensProtocol)\n\n项目介绍；一个无需许可、可组合、去中心化的社交图谱，可以轻松构建 Web3 社交平台。领先的DeFi借贷协议，Aave协议朝着去中心化的进程迈出了一大步并做了巨大的贡献。LensProtocol.lens为Aave团队新作，不光有靓丽的背后团队，确实是有很多不同于其他web3项目的特征。生态涉及面很广，生态里面的项目也是项目方用心筛选出来的，目前已经筛选出来了2期，生态的强大起来是必然的，我们一起陪着生态繁荣昌盛。\n\n空投策略；在lens的生态里，生态项目不断的扩大，我们目前所能涉及的不算多，但是要做到极致，每一个生态项目都值得我们去体验，去支持学习与了解。比如lenster的社交功能，（相互关注）phaver的应用程序，finance的流动性等等。期待第二批生态项目上线我们还是可以抢先体验。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YfPub4FJMB9-0Q-4KRbnP.png?height=673&width=1807)\n\n**5；Carv

是一个用户拥有的游戏身份，可以实现成就展示、朋友和游戏发现、直接获利，并且可以带到任何地方。Carv 就像一座神殿：玩家的链上和链下游戏记忆和时刻被构建、嵌套并与他们的灵魂绑定。灵魂越强，可以解锁的跨游戏奖励就越多。我认为这也属于web3。\n\n空投策略；相互关注，并完成适当的游戏任务和活动任务，雕刻印章，增加雕刻分数，以后分数高有可能对你有很大的帮助，重要一点就是Carv Guardian计划，我们必须立即加入，自己想方设法加入。最后大毛会属于你。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2oac8B9w6LiZpRMURK5t0.png?height=915&width=1398)\n\n**6；Layer3**\n\n融资情况；250万\n\n是否发币；否\n\n项目评级；★★★★\n\n项目官网；\n\n[https://beta.layer3.xyz/earn](https://beta.layer3.xyz/earn)\n\n项目推特；\n\n[https://twitter.com/layer3xyz](https://twitter.com/layer3xyz)\n\n项目介绍；通过做 sh\\*t 赚取加密货币。\n\n空投策略；目前比较单一，主要以做任务拿奖励为主，按照项目方在上面的要求完成任务以后会得到相应的项目方奖励与Layer3的xp，目前用处不大，属于积分形式。\n\n**7；Jambo**\n\n融资情况；3000万\n\n是否发币；否\n\n项目评级；★★★★★\n\n项目官网；<https://jambo.technology/>\n\n项目推特；\n\n[https://twitter.com/JamboTechnology](https://twitter.com/JamboTechnology)\n\n项目介绍；通过 web3

世界中建立您认识和信任的朋友网络。关注你的朋友，让区块链见证你的 Web3 足迹！\n\n空投策略；之前我们提到的lens和这个项目相差不是很大，功能相同就是看这条赛道上面谁更能创新，走出一条web3独特的道路，去中心化应用全部值得去体验，如果你看好就开始吧。\n\n**9；Pyme**\n\n融资情况；无\n\n是否发币；否\n\n项目评级；★★★★\n\n项目官网；\n\n[https://pyme.team/](https://pyme.team/)\n\n项目推特；\n\n[https://twitter.com/Pyme_team](https://twitter.com/Pyme_team)\n\n项目介绍；开始您的 web3 之旅。赚取加密货币和 NFT 并变得很棒！立即加入任务以开始，赚取加密货币和NFT。访问空投并展示您的奖励。棒极了。我们是增长最快的平台，每天帮助成千上万的人赚取加密货币和 NFT。\n\n空投策略；属于还很早期，做任务得NFT为主，也是主打得NFT，所以不管在平台上面所有能得到NFT得就要去做，在这边如果能全部完成并获得NFT一定可以喝汤得。\n\n### 总结；\n\n还有很多web3项目并没有被我纳入其中，可能是早期得太早了，并没有什么策略以及一些基础得东西，以后此文长期更新，耐心添加web3优质并有前景项目，后期也会出一些详细攻略和策略针对每个项目的。请持续关注，你们得支持是我最大的动力，请点赞转发；\n\n[https://twitter.com/Blockchainrese6/status/1538556377408602112](https://twitter.com/Blockchainrese6/status/1538556377408602112)\n\n",

T. 代表 Paradigm Offline Signal Transmitter （范式离线信号发射机）。 它是一个午餐盒大小的小东西。 塑料外壳。 内部拉丝金属面板。 它是与 TPL 通信链接的硬电路板。 理论上来说。\n\n“我必须向范式发送一条信息。 这是唯一的办法。”\n\n“不，你不知道你在说什么。” Sybil 摇摇头。 “八十年来没有人看到过POST。 自从那场雪暴以后就没有人看到过。”\n\n“几个月前，我有点走失了方向。 在那个方向的某个地方。” Spice 又打了个手势。 “我在雪地里看到了一些东西。 我敢肯定。 一个碉堡。 一个前哨。 我不知道。 但它可能就在那里。” 她拿出她的小型古董雷达瞄准它。 “三角测量。”\n\n“那我呢？” Sybil 用手套戳了 Spice 的后背。 “我不能一个人去太阳能驱动器。 如果这是抢匪袭击怎么办？ 又或者是更糟糕的事情？”\n\n我怎样才能在不听起来更疯狂的情况下解释这一切？ 她摇了摇头，把一只手套放在 Sybil 的肩上。 “不是的。 相信我。 你会没事的。 回来的时候替我掩护一下。”\n\nSybil 环顾四周，就好像有什么东西或某人可能会在她放弃并转身前，从雪地里跳出来支持她。 “你欠我一次。”\n\nSpice 把手放到她身边，在面具下微笑着。 “下一次你轮值我替你。 我保证。”\n\n“接下来的两次轮值。” Sybil 瞪着她。\n\n她在点头之前畏缩了一下。 “好吧，两次。 注意安全。”\n\n“你也是。”\n\nSpice 转过身，Sybil 从她身边走过，走向了太阳能收集器。 她开始在她的雷达上进行校准，然后拖着脚步走进了无边无际的白色雪景之中。\n\n### 第二节\n\n“你好，Unironic Ken。”\n\n“你好，Zinc。”\n\n他们远离彼此问候道，但在那空荡荡的禁制式地下酒吧的静止空间中，唯一的另一个声音是调酒师擦拭玻璃器皿发出的吱吱声，伴随着背后的房间里传出来的点唱机民谣。Ken 走近了 Zinc 坐着的隔间，看着门，然后滑过对面褪色的皮凳。\n\nZinc 喝完剩下的霓虹蓝饮料，朝酒保挥了挥空杯子。Unironic Ken 比了个胜利的手势，没有将视线从对方身上移开。\n\n半晌后，Zinc 先开口了，话语中隐隐透出一股紧张。 “我不想打架。”\n\nKen 不相信地哼了一声。 “谁说要打架的？”\n\nZinc 将玻璃杯底部碾着桌子转了个小圈。 “我怎么知道。可能是那个同样没说过要带头冲进城里招惹武士的家伙吧。”\n\n“我们可是会一直收费，直到你们这样的人搞清状况的。” 两杯酒猛地砸在他们之间的桌子上。野蛮的酒保站在他们面前片刻，警惕而恼怒地盯着他们俩。\n\n他们点点头，酒保抱怨着转身离去。 Zinc 利用这一小会深深吸了口气，然后把握紧的拳头压在桌子上来泄压。 “你看，我造就联系你告诉你 Spice 被踢了。”\n\n“她被踢的时候和你在一起？”\n\n“你搞什么？别说了 —— 她说她当时已经给你打过很多次了。你可能正全身心忙着搞游行吧。”他用手捋了捋头发。 “不过，那不是一种正常的被踢。它很突然。很严重。我有点担心。”\n\nUnironic Ken 张了张嘴，然后又闭上了。他慢慢地喝了一口酒，呼出一口气。 “她给我发了信息。”\n\nZinc 挑了挑眉，摇了摇头，喃喃道：“我刚才就是这么说的。”\n\n“不。” Ken 将他那被护腕包裹着的前臂放在他们之间的桌子上。 “在她被踢之后。来自TPL之外。”\n\nZinc 俯过身，歪过头去看那护腕上的信息。\n\n营地阿尔法安全故障时机可疑帮我\n\n他盯着这条信息看了整整一个区块，就仿佛那是用外语写的一样。 “你怎么知道那是她？”\n\nUnironic Ken 耸了耸肩。 “我有一种感觉于是检查了签名。而现在你告诉我她被踢了，所以我很确定是她。”\n\nZinc 再次盯着信息。 “似乎发信息有字数或字符限制。”\n\n“是的。她向我们寻求帮助一定意味着她的营地受到了损害。我查了一下什么是“阿尔法安全故障”。这是 IRL 知识点，所以我找不到太多信息，但一些漂移者在板上提到过，这是一种高阶警报状态，会导致所有多余的电力消耗 —— 比如 TPL 机口 —— 被切断。”\n\nZinc 叹了口气，向后靠了靠，啜着他的饮料，凝视着空气。Ken 的​​护腕发出了刺耳的声音，他的手臂仍然放在桌子上。 “那是谁？”\n\nKen 对着他的护腕皱了皱眉。 “我不知道。这是一条音频消息。加密的。”\n\n他将消息设为播放，然后一个噼啪作响的变形声音出现了，就像一叠垂死的电子产品一样。\n\n“我可以帮你。现在来空灵节点见我。”\n\n消息重复了一次。播放第二遍后，Zinc 喝掉了酒，站了起来。\n\nKen 把头偏到一边。 “你要去哪里？”。\n\n“你觉得我想去哪？”\n\nKen 敲了敲他的护腕。 “我们对这条信息一无所知，更不用说是谁发来的了。可能是个陷阱。”\n\nZinc 耸了耸肩。 “这是我们唯一的线索，Ken。我的意思是，可能发生的最坏情况是什么？被堙灭？” 他用指关节敲了敲桌子以祈求好运。 “你不用跟着来。” 他冲调酒师点了点头，然后朝门口走去。\n\nKen 看着调酒师把抹布在另一个杯子里旋转完，然后咽下了自己的最后一滴酒，然后跟着 Zinc 走出了酒吧。\n\n\n***\n\n空灵节点离这儿只有十五个区块的距离，但今天却感觉更长了。他们两各自上路。 Unironic Ken 贴着街边走，躲在阴影中，每当有车辆驶过或听到附近有噪音时，他就会紧张起来。 Zinc 走得很随意，就像是在去自己的公寓的路上一样，脸上像面具般的略微挂着笑意，观察着另外那个男人。\n\n与城里的许多俱乐部不同，空灵节点灯火通明，仍然在营业。对许多人来说，这座被霓虹灯打亮着的大型建筑似曾相识，这里有最好的音乐、最多元化的人群和最令人兴奋的氛围。\n\n而对另一些人来说，它是第二个家，是一个工作的地方，甚至是一个避世的地方。空灵节点是建立联系、谈判交易和制定计划的地方。如果您想购买化学药品、雇佣杀手，甚至仅仅是寻求小憩 —— 而你不知道该去哪好 —— 你就会来这。 默克尔树可能是权力所在的地方，但空灵节点是权力转移的地方。这意味着空灵节点不需要护卫。即便是在城市一片混乱的情况下，也有一个潜规则，那就是没有人会来扰乱这个地方。否则它的客户会反击。", "timestamp": 1656091731, "digest": "3Z1dYu77AhdNpKDsfwVsLadoCZ_DwPlzDRnNrEEVW3g", "contributor": "0xb99755E6E837Fe71416d7259594752F8E2757b5a"}

Cotton Candy Records will be signing Pip’s closest collaborators and some of the best up-and coming talent in the music industry, in an effort to launch their careers “on-chain”.\n\nThe rollout of the Cotton Candy Records roster will begin post Pip’s debut EP launch in NYC on May 27th.\n\n**WHO IS THOMAS PIPOLO (AKA PIP?)**\n\nUntil 2020, my entire life was dedicated to sports — specifically a love for the game of baseball. From an early age I always had a bat or glove in my hand. While I was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to play at the D1 level, I was unable to fulfill my life-long dream of becoming a professional athlete. Fortunately, I found a new love; music.\n\nEarly on in my college baseball career, I discovered a passion for music. I immediately began to teach myself how to play the piano, acoustic guitar, and sing. Being able to express myself through something other than sports was something I hadn’t experienced in my life before. As time went on, I realized music was my true calling. My skills seemed to develop and progress with ease; it just felt right. When I started receiving positive feedback and encouragement from friends, teammates, and even total strangers on social media, I knew this is what I was meant to do.\n\nUpon graduating, I landed my first interview for a job in New York City, while dedicating all spare time to my true calling; music. As I was brushing my teeth that morning, ready to go to my interview, I stood there looking into the mirror. I felt sick. I felt sick because I knew that this wasn't the life I was meant to live. I went to that interview, and when I got home that day, I decided to go all in and commit to a career as an artist.\n\nAfter making my commitment to music, I quickly found a team of incredibly talented producers and songwriters to support in bringing my art and story to life. Soon after releasing my debut single 2:22 with my closest collaborator, DJ, and Producer 2AM at the end of 2020, I was officially on the map.\n\n**PIP’s CRYPTO JOURNEY**\n\nI came across crypto, blockchain tech, and NFT’s in 2020 when I saw a family friend publish content regarding the space. Being new to the crypto space, I then performed my own research, quickly realizing the rise in crypto, blockchain tech, and NFTs could change the music industry forever. I immediately had a million questions. How does this technology work? How can this translate to the music industry? How can I leverage crypto as an artist and creator? How can fans support their favorite artists through NFTs? Two years later, I found the answers I was looking for. The idea for Cotton Candy Skies was born.\n\n***Cotton Candy Skies - The Launch***\n\nBuild a sustainable and long-lasting career in the music industry through the blockchain\n\nMaintain majority ownership rights of original created musical works\n\nTap into new demographics and build my audience\n\nAllow me to pay friends & collaborators that believe and partake in my creative journey\n\nCreate a connected community drive brand through my music\n\nBe a pioneer within an untapped NFT and Blockchain Music market\n\n**Cotton Candy Skies EP**\n\nCotton Candy Skies is a music project that is reflective, nostalgic, and takes a look forward. No matter who you are in this world, all it takes is one beautiful sunset to take your breath away; slow down time for just a moment. That moment, has a way of inspiring us to follow our passions or create something new in our lives. It detaches us from reality and takes us to a place where anything is possible.\n\nI decided to create my very own sunset. My debut EP, Cotton Candy Skies.\n\n*Track List:* Cotton Candy Skies, Monaco, Remember the Days, Elvis Presley, Cinderella Man, High on Life, 2:22 (ft. 2AM) Just Like the Movies (ft.

Let’s say you happened to be scrolling through YouTube and came across a young kid who was playing guitar and singing a cover that absolutely blew you away. You thought to yourself, “This kid is going to be big one day, let me buy one of his NFTs.” 16 years later you own one of the first NFTs of one of the biggest artists the world has ever seen. His name is Justin Bieber…\n\nThis story is not to say I am going to be Justin Bieber, but it is to say that on top of all of the unique access, utilities, and community, that investing into this crowd fund will provide you, the potential collectible value of owning my first NFT can not be overlooked if you believe in me, my work, and the vision I have for the future.\n\nJake Eckhaus - Songwriter & Project Manager\n\nAli Soomro - Songwriter & Project Manager\n\n2AM - DJ/Producer\n\nAlex DeSalvo - Producer/Songwriter\n\nChosen1 - Producer\n\nEMME - Singer/Songwriter\n\nDan - Producer\n\nCarter Smith - Songwriter\n\nOlivia Daponte - Songwriter\n\nLQ - Artist\n\nManagement - Tha Lights Global", "timestamp": 1656093741, "digest": "ReZCEzV1MmKa3J3btq1F7fV7grkhXrXJ_QXv9fMKgI4", "contributor": "0xaB41A4aCe08F2F31461115DcB4e687A530Ff1060"}
{"id": "-33IdFkyXApHv47rH6q4sMwEZWORtwnXi_BrU0Pbpdw", "title": "Social Networks", "body": "Social networks are some of the most powerful and valuable products in the world capturing a majority of our screen time. From staying on top of the latest news to getting entertained to keeping in touch with friends and family, social apps play a vital role in our lives.\n\nBut, there have been very few social apps that have taken off and sustained in contrast to the thousands of attempts worldwide. From the popular YouTuber, Casey Neistat’s [Beme](https://medium.com/hackernoon/bemes-history-85f3719c7ed0), David Dobrik’s [Dispo](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattklein/2021/02/17/is-dispo-david-dobriks-new-app-and-the-past-our-tech-future/?sh=7855ecac2437), ex-President of the US, Donald Trump’s [Truth Social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social) to the nerdy kids in college dorms — many have tried and still have been trying to build social apps through the years.\n\nI have personally spent the past year building and learning about social apps. And, they are some of the toughest products to build and scale. Infact, building a successful social network is an extremely rare event. It takes tremendous amounts of effort to get them off the ground and it’s an unforgiving grind for the founders trying to build one.\n\nThough building successful social networks is a tough nut to crack, there are a few common themes in all the successful ones. So below, I’ve tried to condense all my learnings to highlight the 5 fundamental factors to building a successful social app.\n\n### 1. Product\n\nFinding the right format and the right set of dedicated tools is a crucial first step for social products. For example, there were many photo-sharing apps that came before Instagram. But, Instagram banked on one core insight at that point: The founders of Instagram saw that an app called Hipstamatic - which basically let users add filters to their photos was rising to the top. The founders noticed that this app grew in popularity even though it was a paid service and saw that people were sharing these photos on other networks like Facebook and Twitter. So they built Instagram and allowed users to add free filters and also share photos on Instagram’s network. And in 2010, it was fairly difficult to get photos off your phone and share to other places, so Instagram made it easy for people to easily share their photos on Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr. A cherry on the top was a comparatively [faster speed of uploading photos](https://www.cultofmac.com/164285/the-clever-trick-instagram-uses-to-upload-photos-so-quickly/) than other apps and a clean grid layout to display all the photos. All these little elements contributed to the initial momentum of Instagram and the rest is, ofcourse, history!\n\nIn many ways, building a social network is like building a new country/economy. Imagine you discovered a new land. Now you want to build an economy, get people to migrate to your country, and grow the population. To do this, you need to first provide people with a compelling reason to make them leave their already established life and move to an entirely new country. It can be one of these 2 reasons:\n\n1. Sell “the American dream” to the people in other countries (content creators on other networks realize that a random person went on to become super-famous through Tiktok and now, they want the same)\n2. Provide an exclusive experience/service that isn’t available anywhere else (disappearing photos on Snapchat, free filters in the early days of Instagram, a directory of all the students from a college in the early days of Facebook, exclusive conversations on Clubhouse in its early days)\n\nIn a social app context, why should I ever leave Snapchat or why should a Youtube creator ever leave the platform to move to your new app? These apps get the job done and moving the entire social graph is highly unlikely.\n\nJust as we’ve seen in the case of Instagram, having a great product hook with a unique social graph and a clear and obvious utility is crucial for social products. Also, almost all social apps start out looking like fun toys in the beginning — there are no complex algorithms, moderation, or plenty of product features either. They're simple, yet powerful tools that allow creative expression.\n\n### 2. Timing\n\nGetting the timing right is quite important for social apps. Coming back to the example of Instagram: teenagers always look for ways to look cool and to differentiate themselves from their parents. As Facebook got more popular, there was widespread parental supervision on the platform. Soon enough, using Facebook had become an embarrassing signal for teens and they naturally hopped on to the cool new hip hangout in the town - Instagram.\n\nTalking about a recent example, the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns played a really important role in the rise of Clubhouse in its early days. It definitely wouldn’t have been possible for Clubhouse to get to the top had it launched just a year back in 2019.\n\n### 3. Atomic Network\n\nFor social apps, it’s all about the people on the app. Unlike other products that inherently possess utility, social apps are default dead on arrival and only become useful when there are others using the app. So, when building a social network, it’s important to achieve a critical mass of connected users in the beginning. Essentially, create a small, stable, engaged network that can self-sustain—an atomic network—then likely you can build a second network adjacent to the first one. This could be a single city, college campus, or small beta test at an individual company.\n\nFor example, Mark Zuckerberg first built Facebook only for Harvard students and then expanded to other campuses and then opened it up to the world. Snapchat famously grew within the high school segment. Discord was specifically for the gamers community in the initial days. Had Discord started with an undesirable set of users, it likely would not have become what it is today. So essentially, social apps start out in a vertical community, establish a strong network and expand then on from there. [Andrew Chen](https://twitter.com/andrewchen) (a16z) has excellently written about this topic in his book - [The Cold Start Problem](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Start-Problem-Andrew-Chen-ebook/dp/B08HZ5XY7X).\n\n### 4. Vibe\n\nThis is more of an art than science. Essentially, vibe for me in a social app context is how people perceive your app and how they feel using it. It’s the sum of a lot of small details IMO: the name, the design, the product positioning, people on the app, and content on the app among others. It might sound not so important on the surface, but it is a trivial component of all successful social apps.\n\nTeens perceive Snapchat as a private, fun, social communications app because of its intimacy-centric design & quirky branding. Another example is that even though [Vine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_(service)) was a short video app like TikTok, it was positioned as a “microblogging website” and focussed on attracting existing creators and never gave rise to as many creators as TikTok did from the early days. But, TikTok positioned itself as a short video karaoke app for lip-syncing and dancing and gave rise to a whole new set of creators from the early days. Though there were a lot of other reasons for the downfall of Vine, positioning was one of the important ones.\n\n### 5. Keeping up\n\nIf you get all of the above right, which is a huge milestone by itself, your app would likely be the talk of the town. The app would always be buzzing, users flock to try out your new thing, servers crash, press reporters call you the next big thing, investors want to be on your cap-table, and there would be a steep increase in spam. While one may only need a small insight and just a couple of people to build the product in the initial days, it takes a tremendous amount of effort after hitting a certain mass of users to scale a network—to counteract market saturation, playing defense against spam and to amplify network effects over time. Even if you’ve got the right product at the right time, if you’re not able to actively keep up the key metrics like the number of sessions per user & retention, the product will likely die and join the graveyard of social apps that couldn’t make it like [MySpace](https://productmint.com/what-happened-to-myspace/#:\\~:text=Myspace%20failed%20because%20of%20rising,2005%20but%20eventually%20flamed%20out.), [Path](https://tech.co/news/path-failure-daum-kakao-2015-05#:\\~:text=Founded%20back%20in%202010%20by,its%20five%20years%20of%20operation.), [Yik Yak](https://productmint.com/what-happened-to-yik-yak/#:\\~:text=Executive%20Summary%3A,having%20a%20sustainable%20business%20model.), [Friendster](https://productmint.com/what-happened-to-friendster/#:\\~:text=Friendster%20failed%20because%20of%20site,network%20for%20a%20short%20time.), and others.\n\nIn this phase of the product, it becomes more important than ever to stay close to the users and use data before making any decision. A great example of this is the introduction of the Instagram Stories feature. According to the founders, Instagram had gotten worse at the job it was originally hired for by its users—allowing people to really quickly show their friends what they're upto—as people were no longer posting as much as they did in the initial days of the app. And Stories was the evolution they had to make in order to recapture the job people originally hired Instagram for.\n\n### Web3 social apps\n\nThere are a lot of developers trying to build a web3 social network in recent days. As stated above, social apps are generally extremely hard to build. Web3 versions of Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube won’t make any difference to the end-user if there’s no strong value proposition other than being decentralized, and permissionless. The value of these giant social networks lies in their content library and the social graph and trying to replace them requires more than just decentralization. Rather, a verticalized web3 social app serving a specific niche (e.g. [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) for crypto-curious folks) or a fresh, new social app built on web3 with a completely new content format and social dynamics might work.\n\nAgain, social apps are hard enough to get off the ground and requiring users to setup a wallet to use the app and making them approve wallet transactions for repeating actions (e.g. confirming a transaction just to like a post) will further reduce the already low probability of success. It can only be made possible if the decentralization & interoperability of the on-chain record is coupled with the seamless experience of off-chain systems.\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nI've just scratched the surface of what constitutes a successful social app. There are a lot of other things that come into consideration when building a social network. But having said all this, most social apps are born unintentionally and out of accidents.\n\nBy and large, innovative products aren’t strategically imagined ahead of time – they’re stumbled upon while experimenting on the go. Instagram was a pivot from Burbn, Twitter spun out of Odeo, Facebook was originally Facemash, BuzzFeed evolved from one of many “for fun” experiments — the list goes on and on. Tomorrow, a high school kid can strike the right idea, break all the rules and still go on to rise to the top with their new creation as a result of luck or timing. Such is the space!\n\nIf you are building in the space or thinking about the future of web3 social, I’d love to chat. [My DMs](https://twitter.com/thrnxr) are open.\n\nThanks for reading, have fun!\n\n[Tharun](https://twitter.com/thrnxr)", "timestamp": 1656094274, "digest": "lnZ5DT1BGLtsnMas6d3U84nceWc5MB8Xa_kbmEq89nA", "contributor": "0x79180828a8259B12F507Ca30737997973E9001c2"}

{"id": "Rw6spz1Z9sd51ZZgp8oTzTRMH8rjjqI3po-rQXlj8Ks", "title": "Social Networks", "body": "Social networks are some of the most powerful and valuable products in the world capturing a majority of our screen time. From staying on top of the latest news to getting entertained to keeping in touch with friends and family, social apps play a vital role in our lives.\n\nBut, there have been very few social apps that have taken off and sustained in contrast to the thousands of attempts worldwide. From the popular YouTuber, Casey Neistat’s [Beme](https://medium.com/hackernoon/bemes-history-85f3719c7ed0), David Dobrik’s [Dispo](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattklein/2021/02/17/is-dispo-david-dobriks-new-app-and-the-past-our-tech-future/?sh=7855ecac2437), ex-President of the US, Donald Trump’s [Truth Social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social) to the nerdy kids in college dorms — many have tried and still have been trying to build social apps through the years.\n\nI have personally spent the past year building and learning about social apps. And, they are some of the toughest products to build and scale. Infact, building a successful social network is an extremely rare event. It takes tremendous amounts of effort to get them off the ground and it’s an unforgiving grind for the founders trying to build one.\n\nThough building successful social networks is a tough nut to crack, there are a few common themes in all the successful ones. So below, I’ve tried to condense all my learnings to highlight the 5 fundamental factors to building a successful social app.\n\n### 1. Product\n\nFinding the right format and the right set of dedicated tools is a crucial first step for social products. For example, there were many photo-sharing apps that came before Instagram. But, Instagram banked on one core insight at that point: The founders of Instagram saw that an app called Hipstamatic - which basically let users add filters to their photos was rising to the top. The founders noticed that this app grew in popularity even though it was a paid service and saw that people were sharing these photos on other networks like Facebook and Twitter. So they built Instagram and allowed users to add free filters and also share photos on Instagram’s network. And in 2010, it was fairly difficult to get photos off your phone and share to other places, so Instagram made it easy for people to easily share their photos on Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr. A cherry on the top was a comparatively [faster speed of uploading photos](https://www.cultofmac.com/164285/the-clever-trick-instagram-uses-to-upload-photos-so-quickly/) than other apps and a clean grid layout to display all the photos. All these little elements contributed to the initial momentum of Instagram and the rest is, ofcourse, history!\n\nIn many ways, building a social network is like building a new country/economy. Imagine you discovered a new land. Now you want to build an economy, get people to migrate to your country, and grow the population. To do this, you need to first provide people with a compelling reason to make them leave their already established life and move to an entirely new country. It can be one of these 2 reasons:\n\n1. Sell “the American dream” to the people in other countries (content creators on other networks realize that a random person went on to become super-famous through Tiktok and now, they want the same)\n2. Provide an exclusive experience/service that isn’t available anywhere else (disappearing photos on Snapchat, free filters in the early days of Instagram, a directory of all the students from a college in the early days of Facebook, exclusive conversations on Clubhouse in its early days)\n\nIn a social app context, why should I ever leave Snapchat or why should a Youtube creator ever leave the platform to move to your new app? These apps get the job done and moving the entire social graph is highly unlikely.\n\nJust as we’ve seen in the case of Instagram, having a great product hook with a unique social graph and a clear and obvious utility is crucial for social products. Also, almost all social apps start out looking like fun toys in the beginning — there are no complex algorithms, moderation, or plenty of product features either. They're simple, yet powerful tools that allow creative expression.\n\n### 2. Timing\n\nGetting the timing right is quite important for social apps. Coming back to the example of Instagram: teenagers always look for ways to look cool and to differentiate themselves from their parents. As Facebook got more popular, there was widespread parental supervision on the platform. Soon enough, using Facebook had become an embarrassing signal for teens and they naturally hopped on to the cool new hip hangout in the town - Instagram.\n\nTalking about a recent example, the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns played a really important role in the rise of Clubhouse in its early days. It definitely wouldn’t have been possible for Clubhouse to get to the top had it launched just a year back in 2019.\n\n### 3. Atomic Network\n\nFor social apps, it’s all about the people on the app. Unlike other products that inherently possess utility, social apps are default dead on arrival and only become useful when there are others using the app. So, when building a social network, it’s important to achieve a critical mass of connected users in the beginning. Essentially, create a small, stable, engaged network that can self-sustain—an atomic network—then likely you can build a second network adjacent to the first one. This could be a single city, college campus, or small beta test at an individual company.\n\nFor example, Mark Zuckerberg first built Facebook only for Harvard students and then expanded to other campuses and then opened it up to the world. Snapchat famously grew within the high school segment. Discord was specifically for the gamers community in the initial days. Had Discord started with an undesirable set of users, it likely would not have become what it is today. So essentially, social apps start out in a vertical community, establish a strong network and expand then on from there. [Andrew Chen](https://twitter.com/andrewchen) (a16z) has excellently written about this topic in his book - [The Cold Start Problem](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Start-Problem-Andrew-Chen-ebook/dp/B08HZ5XY7X).\n\n### 4. Vibe\n\nThis is more of an art than science. Essentially, vibe for me in a social app context is how people perceive your app and how they feel using it. It’s the sum of a lot of small details IMO: the name, the design, the product positioning, people on the app, and content on the app among others. It might sound not so important on the surface, but it is a trivial component of all successful social apps.\n\nTeens perceive Snapchat as a private, fun, social communications app because of its intimacy-centric design & quirky branding. Another example is that even though [Vine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_(service)) was a short video app like TikTok, it was positioned as a “microblogging website” and focussed on attracting existing creators and never gave rise to as many creators as TikTok did from the early days. But, TikTok positioned itself as a short video karaoke app for lip-syncing and dancing and gave rise to a whole new set of creators from the early days. Though there were a lot of other reasons for the downfall of Vine, positioning was one of the important ones.\n\n### 5. Keeping up\n\nIf you get all of the above right, which is a huge milestone by itself, your app would likely be the talk of the town. The app would always be buzzing, users flock to try out your new thing, servers crash, press reporters call you the next big thing, investors want to be on your cap-table, and there would be a steep increase in spam. While one may only need a small insight and just a couple of people to build the product in the initial days, it takes a tremendous amount of effort after hitting a certain mass of users to scale a network—to counteract market saturation, playing defense against spam and to amplify network effects over time. Even if you’ve got the right product at the right time, if you’re not able to actively keep up the key metrics like the number of sessions per user & retention, the product will likely die and join the graveyard of social apps that couldn’t make it like [MySpace](https://productmint.com/what-happened-to-myspace/#:\\~:text=Myspace%20failed%20because%20of%20rising,2005%20but%20eventually%20flamed%20out.), [Path](https://tech.co/news/path-failure-daum-kakao-2015-05#:\\~:text=Founded%20back%20in%202010%20by,its%20five%20years%20of%20operation.), [Yik Yak](https://productmint.com/what-happened-to-yik-yak/#:\\~:text=Executive%20Summary%3A,having%20a%20sustainable%20business%20model.), [Friendster](https://productmint.com/what-happened-to-friendster/#:\\~:text=Friendster%20failed%20because%20of%20site,network%20for%20a%20short%20time.), and others.\n\nIn this phase of the product, it becomes more important than ever to stay close to the users and use data before making any decision. A great example of this is the introduction of the Instagram Stories feature. According to the founders, Instagram had gotten worse at the job it was originally hired for by its users—allowing people to really quickly show their friends what they're upto—as people were no longer posting as much as they did in the initial days of the app. And Stories was the evolution they had to make in order to recapture the job people originally hired Instagram for.\n\n### Web3 social apps\n\nThere are a lot of developers trying to build a web3 social network in recent days. As stated above, social apps are generally extremely hard to build. Web3 versions of Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube won’t make any difference to the end-user if there’s no strong value proposition other than being decentralized, and permissionless. The value of these giant social networks lies in their content library and the social graph and trying to replace them requires more than just decentralization. Rather, a verticalized web3 social app serving a specific niche (e.g. [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) for crypto-curious folks) or a fresh, new social app built on web3 with a completely new content format and social dynamics might work.\n\nAgain, social apps are hard enough to get off the ground and requiring users to setup a wallet to use the app and making them approve wallet transactions for repeating actions (e.g. confirming a transaction just to like a post) will further reduce the already low probability of success. It can only be made possible if the decentralization & interoperability of the on-chain record is coupled with the seamless experience of off-chain systems.\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nI've just scratched the surface of what constitutes a successful social app. There are a lot of other things that come into consideration when building a social network. But having said all this, most social apps are born unintentionally and out of accidents.\n\nBy and large, innovative products aren’t strategically imagined ahead of time – they’re stumbled upon while experimenting on the go. Instagram was a pivot from Burbn, Twitter spun out of Odeo, Facebook was originally Facemash, BuzzFeed evolved from one of many “for fun” experiments — the list goes on and on. Tomorrow, a high school kid can strike the right idea, break all the rules and still go on to rise to the top with their new creation as a result of luck or timing. Such is the space!\n\nIf you are building in the space or thinking about the future of web3 social, I’d love to chat. [My DMs](https://twitter.com/thrnxr) are open.\n\nThanks for reading, have fun!\n\n[Tharun](https://twitter.com/thrnxr)", "timestamp": 1656094408, "digest": "lnZ5DT1BGLtsnMas6d3U84nceWc5MB8Xa_kbmEq89nA", "contributor": "0x79180828a8259B12F507Ca30737997973E9001c2"}

We have built [MetaMail](https://metamail.ink/), now in beta phase. Click the link below to use it:\n\n## Email, Security and Spams\n\nSince the invention of email in the last century, the protocol and running mechanism have not changed fundamentally: the sender submits an email to the mail server with SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and the mail server uses SMTP to transmit the mail to the recipient's mail server. The receiver receives mail from the server through IMAP/POP. While email has become a ubiquitous form of communication around the world and will remain mainstream in the long run, some of these important issues have not been well addressed: the lack of convenient email encryption and the flood of spam.\n\n![Email protocol](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FmIS33MOfmRACQOzZOfRhK.jpeg\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nEmail protocol\n\n**Lack of convenient email encryption:** In SMTP, email is transmitted in plaintext, and the user's email is easily leaked or forged when it is transmitted by the email service provider on the Internet. In order to protect the content of emails, the [Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) proposes to sign emails and encrypt them end-to-end with asymmetric encryption to ensure security. Under the PGP framework, each user needs to maintain his private key and publish public key. When a user sends an email, he would first use his private key to sign the content of the email to ensure the integrity of the email, and then use the recipient's public key to encrypt the mail's private key. The above process ensures that only the sender and recipient can decrypt the mail. The concept of PGP is very good, but it has not become popular. One important reason is that users need to maintain their own public and private key pairs, and ensure that the recipient's public key really belongs to the recipient (because [Man-in-the-Middle-Attack (MIMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) can replace the public key). It’s best to physically confirm the identity of the other and exchange the public key offline. These complicated steps have largely prevented the popularity of PGP mail among mass users. In Web3, every user has a private key, and the user's wallet address is the public key (or the hash of the public key). This problem can be solved naturally.\n\n**Spam flooding:** Spam has been around for almost as long as email and has a growing trend, with an estimated 90% of all emails on the web as spam as of 2014 \\[[Email Spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spam)]. Until now, if one wanted to set up their own in-mail server, he would have to think about how to filter spam, otherwise, the inbox would quickly become overrun with spam. The reason for the proliferation of spam is that on this open protocol, people don't have a good way to prevent [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack), that is, spammers can create a large number of addresses at almost zero cost to send a large number of emails. People can only passively identify and filter them, such as filtering malicious senders by SPF, DIKM, and IP blacklists. If one wants to set up his own out-mail server, he has to go through very complicated steps to avoid sending out mail directly into the trash (binding a domain name, setting a certificate, obtaining a reputable IP). Don't forget, an ugly truth is that all mainstream cloud vendors today have banned port 25 of the cloud host and prohibit users from sending emails from the host to protect the \"reputation\" of the IP address. People prevent spam by setting various strict conditions, which at the same time makes it difficult for individuals to set up a mail server. People have to prove that it is not spam before sending an email, which to a certain extent makes the personal mail service dominated by big platforms like Gmail and QQ Mail.\n\nPlaintext emails and the flood of spam are long-standing problems with email. The MITM attacks and Sybil attacks are commonly faced in the Internet world. Fortunately, blockchain technology can naturally solve the above problems, making it easier than ever to send encrypted emails in Web3 and avoid spam.\n\nIn Web3, users own their addresses and identities, and can use the address/ENS + @ + domain name as their own email addresses.\n\nFor example, an user's Ethereum address is `0x045ff23cf3413f6a355f0acc6ec6cb2721b95d99`, and the MetaMail domain name is `mmail.ink`. Then he can use `0x045ff23cf3413f6a355f0acc6ec6cb2721b95d99@mmail.ink` as the email address. Since this address has registered ENS `suneal.eth`, he can also use `suneal.eth@mmail.ink` as the email address. With such an address, the user can send mail to any mailbox as usual, and receive mail from other mailboxes such as Gmail. Isn't it kind of cool? Well, what's the benefit of this other than being cool?\n\n**The primary benefit is safety.** Each Web3 address/ENS corresponds to a private key managed by the user. When using MetaMail, users can naturally use the private key to sign and encrypt emails. The public key is recorded on the blockchain, eliminating the need to exchange public keys. When users send emails, they use their own private key to sign the entire email content. The recipient can verify the integrity of the email according to the digital signature. The email content remains in the email format and is transmitted seamlessly with all other email addresses through SMTP. When sending emails to other MetaMail users, the recipient's public key can be used to encrypt the email end-to-end, thus ensuring that only the recipient can decrypt the content of the email.\n\n![Key binding](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F7sVeIdEIkmAjFTmqKTcAw.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nKey binding\n\n**Another benefit is that spam can be reduced.** The number of addresses on the blockchain is limited, and creating new addresses requires a certain cost—at least one transaction fee needs to be paid. The mail service providers only need to limit the sending frequency according to the sender's balance settings (a PoS-like mechanism) to block malicious addresses. With this mechanism, sending a large number of emails requires storing a certain balance or creating a large number of addresses, both of which will make it uneconomical to send spam from MetaMail addresses.\n\nSignature and encryption ensure the security of MetaMail. Anti-spam will make MetaMail less likely to be marked as spam by the email filtering system. Moreover, the data of sending and receiving emails are transferred through the server and do not need to be stored on the blockchain, thus the whole process is completely free without gas fees.\n\nIn traditional mailboxes, such as Gmail, users \"apply for\" their own email addresses. In MetaMail, users have stronger control over email accounts. Users own their username, the mail service provider owns the domain name, and the two work together to send emails. Each email needs to be signed by the corresponding user. The encrypted email needs to be decrypted by the user, and the email service provider cannot arbitrarily create an account, or send or decrypt emails.\n\n![Users own their identities](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FaUZImW7YByY6LELeltN0j.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nUsers own their identities\n\nQuite simple, access [metamail.ink](https://metamail.ink/), connect the wallet, then you can get your own email address with the suffix @mmail.ink. The whole process only requires a signature to verify the ownership of the account, completely free without gas fees. Users will not disclose private keys or other information.\n\nIn MetaMail, editing, sending and receiving mail is almost the same as other mail services. Before sending, the user needs to sign the content of the email to ensure its integrity. The signature will be stored in the header of the email EML. The email service provider and the recipient can verify the signature at any time.\n\n![Sign email before sending](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FVwA7L_q-qp9Hy00f7ksgB.webp\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nSign email before sending\n\nWhen sending an encrypted mail, the user creates a random symmetric key locally, encrypts the content of the message with this key, and encrypts this key with the recipient's public key. When receiving an encrypted email, the user needs to use the wallet to decrypt the key for this email, and then use this key to decrypt the entire email. All encryption and decryption are performed at client side, and the email content is encrypted before uploading to the server and during transmission.\n\n![Decrypt MetaMail](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FNoqp0qt82xnZ\\_2pDhHiRd.webp\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nDecrypt MetaMail\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis article introduces the security and spam problems of email. Using MetaMail in Web3 can easily perform email signature, verification, end-to-end encryption-decryption, and can reduce spam. We have implemented MetaMail for use. In the future, we will open-source the code and protocol of MetaMail to facilitate users to build their own MetaMail service.\n", "timestamp": 1656094744, "digest": "4S6lq0S2PMJO0fT2IxJwvOrpKeXaI11fywvbRZQzP74", "contributor": "0xdd856Ea1397d550f778e7Bb9fC4b9B865Adb6321"}

One important reason is that users need to maintain their own public and private key pairs, and ensure that the recipient's public key really belongs to the recipient (because [Man-in-the-Middle-Attack (MIMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) can replace the public key). It’s best to physically confirm the identity of the other and exchange the public key offline. These complicated steps have largely prevented the popularity of PGP mail among mass users. In Web3, every user has a private key, and the user's wallet address is the public key (or the hash of the public key). This problem can be solved naturally.\n\n**Spam flooding:** Spam has been around for almost as long as email and has a growing trend, with an estimated 90% of all emails on the web as spam as of 2014 \\[[Email Spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spam)]. Until now, if one wanted to set up their own in-mail server, he would have to think about how to filter spam, otherwise, the inbox would quickly become overrun with spam. The reason for the proliferation of spam is that on this open protocol, people don't have a good way to prevent [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack), that is, spammers can create a large number of addresses at almost zero cost to send a large number of emails. People can only passively identify and filter them, such as filtering malicious senders by SPF, DIKM, and IP blacklists. If one wants to set up his own out-mail server, he has to go through very complicated steps to avoid sending out mail directly into the trash (binding a domain name, setting a certificate, obtaining a reputable IP). Don't forget, an ugly truth is that all mainstream cloud vendors today have banned port 25 of the cloud host and prohibit users from sending emails from the host to protect the \"reputation\" of the IP address. People prevent spam by setting various strict conditions, which at the same time makes it difficult for individuals to set up a mail server. People have to prove that it is not spam before sending an email, which to a certain extent makes the personal mail service dominated by big platforms like Gmail and QQ Mail.\n\nPlaintext emails and the flood of spam are long-standing problems with email. The MITM attacks and Sybil attacks are commonly faced in the Internet world. Fortunately, blockchain technology can naturally solve the above problems, making it easier than ever to send encrypted emails in Web3 and avoid spam.\n\nIn Web3, users own their addresses and identities, and can use the address/ENS + @ + domain name as their own email addresses.\n\nFor example, an user's Ethereum address is `0x045ff23cf3413f6a355f0acc6ec6cb2721b95d99`, and the MetaMail domain name is `mmail.ink`. Then he can use `0x045ff23cf3413f6a355f0acc6ec6cb2721b95d99@mmail.ink` as the email address. Since this address has registered ENS `suneal.eth`, he can also use `suneal.eth@mmail.ink` as the email address. With such an address, the user can send mail to any mailbox as usual, and receive mail from other mailboxes such as Gmail. Isn't it kind of cool? Well, what's the benefit of this other than being cool?\n\n**The primary benefit is safety.** Each Web3 address/ENS corresponds to a private key managed by the user. When using MetaMail, users can naturally use the private key to sign and encrypt emails. The public key is recorded on the blockchain, eliminating the need to exchange public keys. When users send emails, they use their own private key to sign the entire email content. The recipient can verify the integrity of the email according to the digital signature. The email content remains in the email format and is transmitted seamlessly with all other email addresses through SMTP. When sending emails to other MetaMail users, the recipient's public key can be used to encrypt the email end-to-end, thus ensuring that only the recipient can decrypt the content of the email.\n\n![Key binding](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F7sVeIdEIkmAjFTmqKTcAw.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nKey binding\n\n**Another benefit is that spam can be reduced.** The number of addresses on the blockchain is limited, and creating new addresses requires a certain cost—at least one transaction fee needs to be paid. The mail service providers only need to limit the sending frequency according to the sender's balance settings (a PoS-like mechanism) to block malicious addresses. With this mechanism, sending a large number of emails requires storing a certain balance or creating a large number of addresses, both of which will make it uneconomical to send spam from MetaMail addresses.\n\nSignature and encryption ensure the security of MetaMail. Anti-spam will make MetaMail less likely to be marked as spam by the email filtering system. Moreover, the data of sending and receiving emails are transferred through the server and do not need to be stored on the blockchain, thus the whole process is completely free without gas fees.\n\nIn traditional mailboxes, such as Gmail, users \"apply for\" their own email addresses. In MetaMail, users have stronger control over email accounts. Users own their username, the mail service provider owns the domain name, and the two work together to send emails. Each email needs to be signed by the corresponding user. The encrypted email needs to be decrypted by the user, and the email service provider cannot arbitrarily create an account, or send or decrypt emails.\n\n![Users own their identities](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FaUZImW7YByY6LELeltN0j.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nUsers own their identities\n\nQuite simple, access [metamail.ink](https://metamail.ink/), connect the wallet, then you can get your own email address with the suffix @mmail.ink. The whole process only requires a signature to verify the ownership of the account, completely free without gas fees. Users will not disclose private keys or other information.\n\nIn MetaMail, editing, sending and receiving mail is almost the same as other mail services. Before sending, the user needs to sign the content of the email to ensure its integrity. The signature will be stored in the header of the email EML. The email service provider and the recipient can verify the signature at any time.\n\n![Sign email before sending](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FVwA7L_q-qp9Hy00f7ksgB.webp\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nSign email before sending\n\nWhen sending an encrypted mail, the user creates a random symmetric key locally, encrypts the content of the message with this key, and encrypts this key with the recipient's public key. When receiving an encrypted email, the user needs to use the wallet to decrypt the key for this email, and then use this key to decrypt the entire email. All encryption and decryption are performed at client side, and the email content is encrypted before uploading to the server and during transmission.\n\n![Decrypt MetaMail](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FNoqp0qt82xnZ\\_2pDhHiRd.webp\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nDecrypt MetaMail\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis article introduces the security and spam problems of email. Using MetaMail in Web3 can easily perform email signature, verification, end-to-end encryption-decryption, and can reduce spam. We have implemented MetaMail for use. In the future, we will open-source the code and protocol of MetaMail to facilitate users to build their own MetaMail service.\n", "timestamp": 1656094723, "digest": "4VpRQpkiLNzY91z3R9tSVfkdeXgbL-F2a8ekDSFbkBY", "contributor": "0xdd856Ea1397d550f778e7Bb9fC4b9B865Adb6321"}

It is the first game founded by the Exothium community.\n\n**What is Exothium ?**\n\nExothium is the foundation of an open source community to create, collaborate and have fun around video games. They value transparency, knowledge sharing, creativity, simplicity, friendship and having fun together.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgr9JzI22XGgCvGdtKC3K.png?height=572&width=1076)\n\nCore principles :\n\n* Build and play freely while everyone enjoy the adventure.\n* Build a metaverse that they believe in.\n* Simplicity is the key.\n\nExothium world is much more than a game. It is a game built by the community for the community.\n\n**Presentation of Exothium World !**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lGL7k6v4lTivvcvZQDV22.png?height=297&width=960)\n\nPlayers will start in this new mysterious world without any knowledge and without any objects. The map of this game is completely unknown at the beginning. Each player chooses one of the four races (Apes, Cats, Dogs, Punks) to participate and in the early stages of the game there will be a fight for survival and exploration of the map.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GLSS_hOD_GMG03p6zqtY2.png?height=886&width=926)\n\nAs the map is revealed, the story of current and future players begins to take shape, meaning that the actions and decisions of players will have a direct impact on the story of the game. Over time, new technologies will become available that will make it easy to endure the hardships of the land and life. Four \"ages\" are planned, starting with the EXPLORATION AGE, and the game will evolve in real time to the METALLIC AGE, then the DARK AGE, and finally the MEDIUM AGE.\n\nIn the early eras, the game will focus on exploration, gathering, survival and cooperation, with each player encouraged to walk in groups to increase their chances of survival.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qAUivOugMydS70QVYgkDo.png?height=1128&width=1600)\n\nAt the beginning, every step you take in the map is a step into the unknown. With a bag, it is possible to collect items to make weapons or buildings, for example. These buildings will provide shelter from the weather and give a group of explorers the strength they need for the next few days.\n\nExplorers may encounter animals, mountains, plains, caves, grasses, etc. It will be necessary for some players to focus solely on professions such as hunting, gathering, and farming to help the community grow and continue exploring the map.\n\nWeather will also be crucial in planting crops and deciding on the next steps in exploration. Each day, players will have to make wise choices to increase their chances of finding what they want.\n\nEach character will have a fixed lifespan and there will be mechanisms to spawn and generate new characters, allowing players to expand their legacy, increase the game's population and allow other participants to play the game by selling or offering these new characters.\n\nThis is the beginning of a new metaverse that is entirely generated by real people, built by real people and planned by real people.\n\nIt's no longer about paying to win or playing to win, the goal is for players to have fun and seek real connections with other like-minded people who want to be part of a game that allows for endless exploration, with elements of survival as d&d mixed in with a sandbox mmorpg.\n\nThe game's story will be minimal at the beginning and the vast majority of the story will be built up as the game progresses, allowing players to become part of the story.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1t9ylIRC_CPzUN67IxtWf.png?height=950&width=1556)\n\n**Useful links :**\n\nYellow paper : https://seafile.exothium.com/f/c91c2f97c3fc4fa1ad75/ \n Twiter : https://twitter.com/Exothium\nDiscord : https://discord.gg/3ETQh6ZMPy \n GitCoin Grants: https://gitcoin.co/grants/5422/exothium-open-source-community-gaming", "timestamp": 1656095070, "digest": "FGPJpihxO2RV1JJcAPg247_Nxdo6k8LIBx-ZLDu5l3o", "contributor": "0xdce219E778691a91Dd887CB66C2b73520f5D50Db"}

{"id": "qEL1LMSqWxtNVOCae_uvf4j4l8nbGUk7a3vq-QlyDAA", "title": "MetaMail: Getting Secure Email with Web3", "body": "简介：本文介绍了电子邮件存在的安全性与垃圾邮件问题，提出使用Web3地址来发送和接收电子邮件的方法，其完全兼容普通邮件，免费无gas fee，能够使用密钥对邮件进行签名与端到端的加密，从而达到极致的安全性，并且能够减少垃圾邮件。我们搭建了[MetaMail](https://metamail.ink/)，现在处于Beta阶段，点击以下链接使用：\n\n## Email, Security and Spams\n\n从上世纪电子邮件被发明至今，电子邮件的协议与运行机制没有太大变化：发信人使用SMTP协议将邮件提交到邮件服务器，邮件服务器间通过SMTP协议传送邮件到收件人的邮件服务器，收件人通过IMAP/POP协议从服务器收取邮件。虽然电子邮件已成为全球普遍使用的通信方式，并且在可见的未来一直保持主流，但其中一些重要的问题一直没有很好地被解决：缺乏方便的邮件加密和垃圾邮件泛滥。\n\n![Email protocol](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F-Ex7yDdnUQdWpuBvQWw2T.jpeg\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nEmail protocol\n\n**缺乏方便的邮件加密方式：** 在SMTP协议里，邮件内容是明文传输的，用户的邮件由邮件服务提供商在互联网传输时，很容易被泄露或伪造。为了保护邮件内容被篡改泄露，[PGP组织](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy)提出通过非对称加密等技术对邮件进行签名与端对端加密来保证邮件安全。在PGP框架下，每个用户需要维护自己的私钥，公布自己的公钥，当用户发送邮件时，使用自己的私钥对邮件内容进行签名，保证邮件的完整性，使用收件者的公钥对邮件密钥进行加密，保证邮件只有收发双方才能解密邮件。PGP的理念非常好，但是并没有普遍流行起来，其重要原因之一是需要用户维护自己的公私钥对，并且确保收件人的公钥确实是属于收件的人的公钥（因为[中间人攻击](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)可能替换掉公钥），而安全的方法是收发双方线下用物理的方式确认对方身份并交换公钥，这些较为复杂的步骤在很大程度上阻止了PGP邮件在普通用户间的流行。而在Web3里，每个用户都拥有私钥，用户的钱包地址即公钥（或公钥的哈希），这个问题可以自然地被解决。\n\n**垃圾邮件泛滥：** 垃圾邮件的历史几乎和电子邮件的历史一样久，并且具有越来越严重的趋势，据估计，截止到2014年，网络上90%的电子邮件都是垃圾邮件\\[[Email Spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spam)]。直到现在，如果一个人想设置自己的收邮件服务器，将不得不考虑如何过滤垃圾邮件，否则收件箱会很快被垃圾邮件占据。垃圾邮件泛滥的根本原因是，在这种开放的协议上，人们没有很好的方式来防止[女巫攻击](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack)，即垃圾邮件发送者可以以几乎0成本的方式制造大量的地址发送大量的邮件，人们只能被动地识别与过滤它们，例如过SPF、DIKM以及建立IP黑名单等方式来过滤恶意发送者。当今个人如果想设立自己的发邮件服务器，也要经历十分复杂的步骤来避免发出的邮件直接被丢进垃圾箱（绑定域名，设置证书，获得信誉良好的IP），别忘了，一个ugly truth是当今所有的主流云厂商都会禁掉云主机的25号端口，禁止用户从主机发邮件，以保护IP地址的”信誉”。人们通过设置各种严格的条件来防止垃圾邮件，也同时提高了个人建立邮件服务器的困难程度——发邮件前你得先证明这不是垃圾邮件，这在一定程度上也使得邮件服务越来越集中在大平台如Gmail和QQMail中。\n\n明文邮件和垃圾邮件泛滥是电子邮件长久以来的问题，其背后的中间人攻击与女巫攻击是互联网世界普遍面临的攻击模型。幸运的是，区块链技术可以很自然地解决这两个问题，在Web3中能够比以往更简单地发送加密邮件，并且避免垃圾邮件。\n\n在Web3里，用户拥有自己的地址与身份，可以使用地址/ENS + @ + 域名作为自己的邮箱地址。\n\n例如用户以太坊地址为`0x045ff23cf3413f6a355f0acc6ec6cb2721b95d99`，MetaMail域名为`mmail.ink`。那么可以使用`0x045ff23cf3413f6a355f0acc6ec6cb2721b95d99@mmail.ink`作为邮箱地址。由于此地址已绑定了ENS suneal.eth，所以可以同样使用`suneal.eth@mmail.ink`作为邮箱地址。使用这样的地址，可以像往常一样往任何邮箱发送邮件，也可以接收来自Gmail等其他邮箱的邮件，是不是有点酷？Well，除了酷之外这样有什么好处呢？\n\n首要的好处是安全。每个Web3地址/ENS都对应着由用户管理的私钥，用户在使用MetaMail时可以自然地用私钥进行邮件签名与加密，公钥则是记录在区块链上，省去了需要相互交换公钥的步骤。用户在发送邮件时，使用自己的私钥对整个邮件内容进行签名，接收者可以根据数字签名校验邮件的完整性，邮件内容仍然保持email格式，通过SMTP协议传送，与所有其他邮箱地址无缝互通；当向其他MetaMail用户发送邮件时，可以使用收件人的公钥对邮件进行端到端的加密，从而保证只有收件人才能看到邮件内容。\n\n![Key binding](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FcPFVn8pjp6zMElwyOCsnN.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nKey binding\n\n另一个好处是可以减少垃圾邮件。区块链上的地址数量是有限的，创造新地址需要一定的成本——需要付至少一笔Transaction的手续费，邮件服务商者只需要根据发送者的余额设置限制发送频率（类似于PoS），屏蔽恶意地址即可防止垃圾邮件，此时发送大量邮件需要存储一定的余额或者制造大量的地址——两者的成本都会使得从MetaMail地址发送垃圾邮件不再经济。\n\n使用MetaMail，签名与加密保证邮件的安全，防垃圾邮件会使得MetaMail被邮件过滤系统标记为垃圾邮件的概率更小，此时收发邮件的数据本身通过服务器中转，并不需要存储在区块链上，所以整个过程完全免费无Gas费。\n\n传统邮箱里如Gmail，用户是在『申请』自己的邮箱地址。在MetaMail中，用户对邮件账户拥有更强的控制，用户拥有他们的用户名，邮件服务提供商拥有域名，两者合作才能进行发送邮件。每发一封邮件都需要对应用户的签名，加密的邮件需要用户才能解密，邮件服务提供商也不能任意创造账户、发送或者解密邮件。\n\n![Users own their identities](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fducif5z3d1SyecoEs9EO-.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nUsers own their identities\n\n非常简单，我们已经实现MetaMail，访问[metamail.ink](https://metamail.ink/)，连接钱包，即可获得自己的@mmail.ink后缀的邮箱地址，整个过程只需要签名验证账号归属，完全免费无gas费，用户不会泄露私钥等信息。\n\n在MetaMail里，编辑、发送与接收邮件与其他邮件服务几乎没有区别。在发送前，用户需要对邮件内容进行签名，确保邮件的完整性。签名的信息会存储在邮件eml的文件头，邮件服务商与收件人可以随时进行验证。\n\n![Sign email before sending](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FBVqU_ri4VSe6dp8kzJCCA.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nSign email before sending\n\n在发送加密邮件时，用户会在本地创建随机的对称密钥，使用此密钥对邮件内容进行加密，然后使用接收者的公钥加密此密钥。接收到加密邮件时，用户需要使用钱包解密出此封邮件的密钥，然后使用此密钥对整封邮件进行解密。所有加密和解密都是在前端进行的，邮件内容在上传至服务器和传送过程中都处于加密状态。\n\n![Decrypt MetaMail](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FN5CDox7RwReXNenpqWS7F.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\nDecrypt MetaMail\n\n## Conclusion\n\n本文介绍了电子邮件存在的安全性与垃圾邮件问题，在Web3中使用MetaMail能够方便地进行邮件签名、验证和端到端的加解密，并且能够减少垃圾邮件。我们实现了MetaMail供用户使用，在未来，我们会将MetaMail的代码与协议开源，以方便用户搭建自己的MetaMail服务。\n", "timestamp": 1656094870, "digest": "GfM9MRSBxggW1borC-hSTrXQDnWQ0jbh9WiipBCyNWA", "contributor": "0xdd856Ea1397d550f778e7Bb9fC4b9B865Adb6321"}

It has been tested with a specific Git commit.***\n* ***This guide will be updated (and simplified) as soon as corresponding official unstable/stable Docker images by SigmaPrime will have been published.***\n* ***Lighthouse Devs are thankful for community feedback, e.g. in their [Discord](https://discord.gg/cyAszAh).***\n\n\n---\n\n*This post aims to provide a quick and minimalistic setup guide on how to test accessing MEV as a validator on the Ropsten testnet.*\n\n*[In a preceding guide](https://mirror.xyz/ladislaus.eth/O5bW3rDnKITHlCXE9K_0IwiEwDrc6qw-y3MpX0EUcew) I tried to highlight essential requirements for running an Ethereum node post-merge using Ubuntu & Docker. With* `mev-boost` *as an optional, additional piece of software in the node stack, I try to leverage* `docker-compose` *this time.*\n\n## MEVvvhat…?!\n\nMaximum Extractable Value is a controversial topic within the Ethereum ecosystem. As the network has experienced increased adoption and settlement value, profitable opportunities to insert TXs at particular places of a block have become more prevalent.\n\nThese practices are often referred to as *front-running*, among others, implying centralisation vectors and even chain instabilities. Hence, the ultimate goal for blockchain R&D is to minimize (or eliminate?!) such negative externalities for users and the network as a whole. A first step towards mitigating them is to democratize access to MEV.\n\n> In essence, MEV boils down to the fundamental question of how the process of fair transaction ordering in a block is supposed to happen in the most trust-minimised fashion.\n\nTechnically, a validator -representing the proposer of a block- defaults to asking the local execution client for a particular transaction order (typically ranked by the highest paying TX fees). However, there’s also the option to ask a third-party **relay** for a pre-constructed block, e.g. [Flashbots](https://docs.flashbots.net/), a collective operating an external block builder protocol. A relay is a doubly-trusted intermediary matching specialised builders on the one hand with validators on the other hand.\n\n![src: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flashbots/mev-boost/main/docs/mev-boost-integration-overview.png?&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nNode operators can access MEV with the help of a software called `mev-boost` by Flashbots. In the given case, if it’s the validator’s turn to propose a block, the CL client Lighthouse will ask both mev-boost and the EL client Besu for a block, ultimately opting for the better paying one.\n\n*Note:*\n\n* *At the time of writing no one is sending transaction bundles to the Flashbots relay on Ropsten (i.e. there are no more valuable blocks from the relay to process)*\n* *In case a relay provided the validator with an invalid block (header), which turned out to be invalid after the validator client had signed it, this does **not** represent a slashable event (rather leads to a missed proposal).*\n\nRead about how [Flashbots argues for running mev-boost](https://writings.flashbots.net/writings/why-run-mevboost). And feel free to dive deeper into the woods [here](https://twitter.com/lightclients/status/1533915131536605185), [here](https://youtu.be/vhxIjEnhutw) and [here](https://youtu.be/OD54WfVuDWw). There’s a bunch of open social, technical and cryptoeconomic research and design questions to be tackled.\n\n\n---\n\n### Interlude: self-build the Lighthouse Docker image locally\n\n> *This step can be omitted as soon as the necessary code will have been included in the unstable branch of the Lighthouse repository.*\n\n**1)** Navigate in a CLI into your `/home` directory. Download the proper source files from a given Github repository and a given commit hash (*has been tested*):\n\n*More adventurous users could try out later commits on [this branch](https://github.com/realbigsean/lighthouse/tree/pre-bellatrix-blinded-blocks). They might not be stable, however, as it is currently under active development.*\n\n```\n$ git clone -n https://github.com/realbigsean/lighthouse/; cd lighthouse\n$ git checkout d12d03b2b0165e67f5ebc63db575d8925ddf05c5\n```\n\n**2)** Build the docker image (may take some time):\n\n```\n$ docker build . -t lighthouse:mevboost-develop\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## How to access MEV on Ropsten\n\nFor the sake of this demo, I chose Besu by ConsenSys as an EL client. It comes with a lean new database structure called [“Bonsai tries” and offers implicit pruning functionality](https://consensys.net/blog/news/test-staking-ahead-of-the-merge-with-improved-bonsai-tries-state-storage/), lowering disk space usage and avoiding potential downtimes for manual pruning. Snap sync is also about to hit the latest release. Lighthouse by SigmaPrime serves as CL client (i.e. Beacon Node & Validator Client). \n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* [Ubuntu & pre-installed docker-compose](https://eth-docker.net/docs/Usage/Prerequisites/#ubuntu-prerequisites)\n* [A validator keystore for Ropsten](https://github.com/remyroy/ethstaker/blob/main/merge-ropsten.md#trying-the-ropsten-testnet)\n* Specify [--suggested-fee-recipient](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/suggested-fee-recipient.html)\n* *Optionally* modify the data directories that get mounted from the host into the Besu/Lighthouse docker containers\n\n### Run a complete node stack with mev-boost\n\n**1)** Navigate to your `/home` directory. Create a project directory with subfolders:\n\n```\n$ mkdir -p ETHclient/{besu,lighthouse-bn,lighthouse-vc,validator_keys,JWT}; cd ETHclient\n```\n\n**2)** Generate a [JasonWebToken (JWT)](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/05/30/ropsten-merge-announcement/) so that the execution and consensus client can communicate securely:\n\n```\n$ openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d \"\\n\" > \"$(pwd)/JWT/jwtsecret\"\n```\n\n**3)** Paste the validator keystore(s) in the host directory `./validator_keys`\n\n**4)** [Add the validator key to Lighthouse](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator-import-launchpad.html#docker)\n\n```\n$ docker run -it -v $(pwd)/lighthouse-vc:/root/.lighthouse -v $(pwd)/validator_keys:/validator_keys lighthouse:mevboost-develop lighthouse --network ropsten account validator import --directory /validator_keys\n```\n\n**5)** Copy & Paste the below attached docker-compose code in a newly created file to be named `besu-lh-mevboost.yaml` in the project directory.\n\n**6)** Start the docker-compose environment:\n\n```\n$ docker-compose -f besu-lh-mevboost.yaml -p ropsten up -d\n```\n\n**7)** Eventually, stop the docker-compose environment:\n\n```\n$ docker-compose -f besu-lh-mevboost.yaml -p ropsten stop\n```\n\n\n---\n\n```yml\nversion: \"3.0\"\n\nservices:\n    beacon_node:\n        image: lighthouse:mevboost-develop\n        networks:\n            -

IL Protection from Bancor is currently paused. Users can still withdraw their positions from Bancor during this time; however, if a user withdraws, they will not get the tokens earned from IL protection. If a depositor has tokens on Bancor V2 and wishes to withdraw from the platform, they must first migrate to V3. Users who migrate from V2 to V3 during the pause will also lose their IL protection earned tokens. Bancor has stated in their article that this is a temporary measure to protect their protocol and its users. Once Bancor turns back on IL protection, users will be entitled to all of the tokens allocated to them. Users with deposited funds in their protocol will continue to earn yields and will be entitled to withdraw their fully-protected value when IL protection is reactivated. Learn more about Bancor's update in their article below. We will continue to update the ICHI community as we learn more. **If a user deposited before Saturday when they paused IL protection, their deposited funds are earning IL protection yields.** This is in reference to Bancor's latest medium post <https://blog.bancor.network/market-conditions-update-june-19-2022-e5b857b39336>\n\n**ETH SEATTLE 2022**\n\nETH Seattle this year will take place on July 8th.

It has been tested with a specific Git commit.***\n* ***This guide will be updated (and simplified) as soon as corresponding official unstable/stable Docker images by SigmaPrime will have been published.***\n* ***Lighthouse Devs are thankful for community feedback, e.g. in their [Discord](https://discord.gg/cyAszAh).***\n\n\n---\n\n*This post aims to provide a quick and minimalistic setup guide on how to test accessing MEV as a validator on the Ropsten testnet.*\n\n*[In a preceding guide](https://mirror.xyz/ladislaus.eth/O5bW3rDnKITHlCXE9K_0IwiEwDrc6qw-y3MpX0EUcew) I tried to highlight essential requirements for running an Ethereum node post-merge using Ubuntu & Docker. With* `mev-boost` *as an optional, additional piece of software in the node stack, I try to leverage* `docker-compose` *this time.*\n\n## MEVvvhat…?!\n\nMaximum Extractable Value is a controversial topic within the Ethereum ecosystem. As the network has experienced increased adoption and settlement value, profitable opportunities to insert TXs at particular places of a block have become more prevalent.\n\nThese practices are often referred to as *front-running*, among others, implying centralisation vectors and even chain instabilities. Hence, the ultimate goal for blockchain R&D is to minimize (or eliminate?!) such negative externalities for users and the network as a whole. A first step towards mitigating them is to democratize access to MEV.\n\n> In essence, MEV boils down to the fundamental question of how the process of fair transaction ordering in a block is supposed to happen in the most trust-minimised fashion.\n\nTechnically, a validator -representing the proposer of a block- defaults to asking the local execution client for a particular transaction order (typically ranked by the highest paying TX fees). However, there’s also the option to ask a third-party **relay** for a pre-constructed block, e.g. [Flashbots](https://docs.flashbots.net/), a collective operating an external block builder protocol. A relay is a doubly-trusted intermediary matching specialised builders on the one hand with validators on the other hand.\n\n![src: https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flashbots/mev-boost/main/docs/mev-boost-integration-overview.png?&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\n\nNode operators can access MEV with the help of a software called `mev-boost` by Flashbots. In the given case, if it’s the validator’s turn to propose a block, the CL client Lighthouse will ask both mev-boost and the EL client Besu for a block, ultimately opting for the better paying one.\n\n*Note:*\n\n* *At the time of writing no one is sending transaction bundles to the Flashbots relay on Ropsten (i.e. there are no more valuable blocks from the relay to process)*\n* *In case a relay provided the validator with an invalid block (header), which turned out to be invalid after the validator client had signed it, this does **not** represent a slashable event (rather leads to a missed proposal).*\n\nRead about how [Flashbots argues for running mev-boost](https://writings.flashbots.net/writings/why-run-mevboost). And feel free to dive deeper into the woods [here](https://twitter.com/lightclients/status/1533915131536605185), [here](https://youtu.be/vhxIjEnhutw) and [here](https://youtu.be/OD54WfVuDWw). There’s a bunch of open social, technical and cryptoeconomic research and design questions to be tackled.\n\n\n---\n\n### Interlude: self-build the Lighthouse Docker image locally\n\n> *This step can be omitted as soon as the necessary code will have been included in the unstable branch of the Lighthouse repository.*\n\n**1)** Navigate in a CLI into your `/home` directory. Download the proper source files from a given Github repository and a given commit hash (*has been tested*):\n\n*More adventurous users could try out later commits on [this branch](https://github.com/realbigsean/lighthouse/tree/pre-bellatrix-blinded-blocks). They might not be stable, however, as it is currently under active development.*\n\n```\n$ git clone -n https://github.com/realbigsean/lighthouse/; cd lighthouse\n$ git checkout d12d03b2b0165e67f5ebc63db575d8925ddf05c5\n```\n\n**2)** Build the docker image (may take some time):\n\n```\n$ docker build . -t lighthouse:mevboost-develop\n```\n\n\n---\n\n## How to access MEV on Ropsten\n\nFor the sake of this demo, I chose Besu by ConsenSys as an EL client. It comes with a lean new database structure called [“Bonsai tries” and offers implicit pruning functionality](https://consensys.net/blog/news/test-staking-ahead-of-the-merge-with-improved-bonsai-tries-state-storage/), lowering disk space usage and avoiding potential downtimes for manual pruning. Snap sync is also about to hit the latest release. Lighthouse by SigmaPrime serves as CL client (i.e. Beacon Node & Validator Client). \n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* [Ubuntu & pre-installed docker-compose](https://eth-docker.net/docs/Usage/Prerequisites/#ubuntu-prerequisites)\n* [A validator keystore for Ropsten](https://github.com/remyroy/ethstaker/blob/main/merge-ropsten.md#trying-the-ropsten-testnet)\n* Specify [--suggested-fee-recipient](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/suggested-fee-recipient.html)\n* *Optionally* modify the data directories that get mounted from the host into the Besu/Lighthouse docker containers\n\n### Run a complete node stack with mev-boost\n\n**1)** Navigate to your `/home` directory. Create a project directory with subfolders:\n\n```\n$ mkdir -p ETHclient/{besu,lighthouse-bn,lighthouse-vc,validator_keys,JWT}; cd ETHclient\n```\n\n**2)** Generate a [JasonWebToken (JWT)](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/merge-readiness/) so that the execution and consensus client can communicate securely:\n\n```\n$ openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d \"\\n\" > \"$(pwd)/JWT/jwtsecret\"\n```\n\n**3)** Paste the validator keystore(s) in the host directory `./validator_keys`\n\n**4)** [Add the validator key to Lighthouse](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator-import-launchpad.html#docker)\n\n```\n$ docker run -it -v $(pwd)/lighthouse-vc:/root/.lighthouse -v $(pwd)/validator_keys:/validator_keys lighthouse:mevboost-develop lighthouse --network ropsten account validator import --directory /validator_keys\n```\n\n**5)** Copy & Paste the below attached docker-compose code in a newly created file to be named `besu-lh-mevboost.yaml` in the project directory.\n\n**6)** Start the docker-compose environment:\n\n```\n$ docker-compose -f besu-lh-mevboost.yaml -p ropsten up -d\n```\n\n**7)** Eventually, stop the docker-compose environment:\n\n```\n$ docker-compose -f besu-lh-mevboost.yaml -p ropsten stop\n```\n\n\n---\n\n```yml\nversion: \"3.0\"\n\nservices:\n    beacon_node:\n        image: lighthouse:mevboost-develop\n        networks:\n            -

To support this event and really involve the community, as well as Polygon community, we have launched a 7-day Gleam Campaign (a few days in by now). This campaign consists of tasks to do to enter a raffle to win $100 worth of ICHI. The more tasks you do, the more chances you have of winning. Join here! <https://gleam.io/t8yUY/polygon-x-ichi-ama>\n\nThe AMA will take place on Polygon’s [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XvpHAxZ).\n\n**CRYPTO CURRENT INTERVIEWS BEN SPICKARD**\n\nCrypto Current recently interviewed [Ben Spickard](https://twitter.com/benspickard), ICHI’s head of marketing and founding team member. In this interview, Ben explains what ICHI is and what ICHI can offer DeFi through Angel Vaults, HODL Vaults and Branded Dollars, and reflects on the project’s recent developments vis a vis leverage and DeFi.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS9HNbI8tC4&ab_channel=CryptoCurrent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS9HNbI8tC4&ab_channel=CryptoCurrent)\n\nGive Crypto Current a follow:\n\n[https://twitter.com/](https://twitter.com/_cryptocurrent_)*[cryptocurrent](https://twitter.com/_cryptocurrent_)*\n\n**BANCOR IMPERMANENT LOSS PROTECTION PAUSE**\n\nIn order to support the ICHI community, we wish to clarify a few details about what we have learned regarding the temporary pause on Impermanent Loss Protection on Bancor. IL Protection from Bancor is currently paused. Users can still withdraw their positions from Bancor during this time; however, if a user withdraws, they will not get the tokens earned from IL protection. If a depositor has tokens on Bancor V2 and wishes to withdraw from the platform, they must first migrate to V3. Users who migrate from V2 to V3 during the pause will also lose their IL protection earned tokens. Bancor has stated in their article that this is a temporary measure to protect their protocol and its users. Once Bancor turns back on IL protection, users will be entitled to all of the tokens allocated to them. Users with deposited funds in their protocol will continue to earn yields and will be entitled to withdraw their fully-protected value when IL protection is reactivated. Learn more about Bancor's update in their article below. We will continue to update the ICHI community as we learn more. **If a user deposited before Saturday when they paused IL protection, their deposited funds are earning IL protection yields.** This is in reference to Bancor's latest medium post <https://blog.bancor.network/market-conditions-update-june-19-2022-e5b857b39336>\n\n**ETH SEATTLE 2022**\n\nETH Seattle this year will take place on July 8th. There will be cool talks, drinks , and billiards. ICHI Foundation’s steward Bryan Gross will be speaking at this event.

{"id": "kuL9kT9tvbMPXearHZJaCW94pVzIrHiApd9ZiebEHos", "title": "Social Networks", "body": "Social networks are some of the most powerful and valuable products in the world capturing a majority of our screen time. From staying on top of the latest news to getting entertained to keeping in touch with friends and family, social apps play a vital role in our lives.\n\nBut, there have been very few social apps that have taken off and sustained in contrast to the thousands of attempts worldwide. From the popular YouTuber, Casey Neistat’s [Beme](https://medium.com/hackernoon/bemes-history-85f3719c7ed0), David Dobrik’s [Dispo](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattklein/2021/02/17/is-dispo-david-dobriks-new-app-and-the-past-our-tech-future/?sh=7855ecac2437), ex-President of the US, Donald Trump’s [Truth Social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social) to the nerdy kids in college dorms — many have tried and still have been trying to build social apps through the years.\n\nI have personally spent the past year building and learning about social apps. And, they are some of the toughest products to build and scale. Infact, building a successful social network is an extremely rare event. It takes tremendous amounts of effort to get them off the ground and it’s an unforgiving grind for the founders trying to build one.\n\nThough building successful social networks is a tough nut to crack, there are a few common themes in all the successful ones. So below, I’ve tried to condense all my learnings to highlight the 5 fundamental factors to building a successful social app.\n\n### 1. Product\n\nFinding the right format and the right set of dedicated tools is a crucial first step for social products. For example, there were many photo-sharing apps that came before Instagram. But, Instagram banked on one core insight at that point: The founders of Instagram saw that an app called Hipstamatic - which basically let users add filters to their photos was rising to the top. The founders noticed that this app grew in popularity even though it was a paid service and saw that people were sharing these photos on other networks like Facebook and Twitter. So they built Instagram and allowed users to add free filters and also share photos on Instagram’s network. And in 2010, it was fairly difficult to get photos off your phone and share to other places, so Instagram made it easy for people to easily share their photos on Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr. A cherry on the top was a comparatively [faster speed of uploading photos](https://www.cultofmac.com/164285/the-clever-trick-instagram-uses-to-upload-photos-so-quickly/) than other apps and a clean grid layout to display all the photos. All these little elements contributed to the initial momentum of Instagram and the rest is, ofcourse, history!\n\nIn many ways, building a social network is like building a new country/economy. Imagine you discovered a new land. Now you want to build an economy, get people to migrate to your country, and grow the population. To do this, you need to first provide people with a compelling reason to make them leave their already established life in a country and move to an entirely new country. It can be achieved through one of these 2 ways:\n\n1. Sell “the American dream” to the people in other countries (content creators on other networks realize that a random person went on to become super-famous through Tiktok. So they think “Maybe I can do the same?”)\n2. Provide an exclusive experience/service that isn’t available anywhere else (disappearing photos on Snapchat, free filters in the early days of Instagram, a directory of all the students from a college in the early days of Facebook, exclusive conversations on Clubhouse in its early days)\n\nIn a social app context, why should I ever leave Snapchat or why should a Youtube creator ever leave the platform to move to your new app? These apps get the job done and moving the entire social graph is highly unlikely.\n\nJust as we’ve seen in the case of Instagram, having a great product hook with a unique social graph and a clear and obvious utility is crucial for social products. Also, almost all social apps start out looking like fun toys in the beginning — there are no complex algorithms, moderation, or plenty of product features either. They're simple, yet powerful tools that allow creative expression.\n\n### 2. Timing\n\nGetting the timing right is quite important for social apps. Coming back to the example of Instagram: teenagers always look for ways to look cool and to differentiate themselves from their parents. As Facebook got more popular, there was widespread parental supervision on the platform. Soon enough, using Facebook had become an embarrassing signal for teens and they naturally hopped on to the cool new hip hangout in the town - Instagram.\n\nTalking about a recent example, the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns played a really important role in the rise of Clubhouse in its early days. It definitely wouldn’t have been possible for Clubhouse to get to the top had it launched just a year back in 2019.\n\n### 3. Atomic Network\n\nFor social apps, it’s all about the people on the app. Unlike other products that inherently possess utility, social apps are default dead on arrival and only become useful when there are others using the app. So, when building a social network, it’s important to achieve a critical mass of connected users in the beginning. Essentially, create a small, stable, engaged network that can self-sustain—an atomic network—then likely you can build a second network adjacent to the first one. This could be a single city, college campus, or small beta test at an individual company.\n\nFor example, Mark Zuckerberg first built Facebook only for Harvard students and then expanded to other campuses and then opened it up to the world. Snapchat famously grew within the high school segment. Discord was specifically for the gamers community in the initial days. Had Discord started with an undesirable set of users, it likely would not have become what it is today. So essentially, social apps start out in a vertical community, establish a strong network and expand then on from there. [Andrew Chen](https://twitter.com/andrewchen) (a16z) has excellently written about this topic in his book - [The Cold Start Problem](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Start-Problem-Andrew-Chen-ebook/dp/B08HZ5XY7X).\n\n### 4. Vibe\n\nThis is more of an art than science. Essentially, vibe for me in a social app context is how people perceive your app and how they feel using it. It’s the sum of a lot of small details IMO: the name, the design, the product positioning, people on the app, and content on the app among others. It might sound not so important on the surface, but it is a trivial component of all successful social apps.\n\nTeens perceive Snapchat as a private, fun, social communications app because of its intimacy-centric design & quirky branding. Another example is that even though [Vine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_(service)) was a short video app like TikTok, it was positioned as a “microblogging website” and focussed on attracting existing creators and never gave rise to as many creators as TikTok did from the early days. But, TikTok positioned itself as a short video karaoke app for lip-syncing and dancing and gave rise to a whole new set of creators from the early days. Though there were a lot of other reasons for the downfall of Vine, positioning was one of the important ones.\n\n### 5. Keeping up\n\nIf you get all of the above right, which is a huge milestone by itself, your app would likely be the talk of the town. The app would always be buzzing, users flock to try out your new thing, servers crash, press reporters call you the next big thing, investors want to be on your cap-table, and there would be a steep increase in spam. While one may only need a small insight and just a couple of people to build the product in the initial days, it takes a tremendous amount of effort after hitting a certain mass of users to scale a network—to counteract market saturation, playing defense against spam and to amplify network effects over time. Even if you’ve got the right product at the right time, if you’re not able to actively keep up the key metrics like the number of sessions per user & retention, the product will likely die and join the graveyard of social apps that couldn’t make it like [MySpace](https://productmint.com/what-happened-to-myspace/#:\\~:text=Myspace%20failed%20because%20of%20rising,2005%20but%20eventually%20flamed%20out.), [Path](https://tech.co/news/path-failure-daum-kakao-2015-05#:\\~:text=Founded%20back%20in%202010%20by,its%20five%20years%20of%20operation.), [Yik Yak](https://productmint.com/what-happened-to-yik-yak/#:\\~:text=Executive%20Summary%3A,having%20a%20sustainable%20business%20model.), [Friendster](https://productmint.com/what-happened-to-friendster/#:\\~:text=Friendster%20failed%20because%20of%20site,network%20for%20a%20short%20time.), and others.\n\nIn this phase of the product, it becomes more important than ever to stay close to the users and make data-informed decisions. A great example of this is the introduction of the Instagram Stories feature. According to the founders, Instagram had gotten worse at the job it was originally hired for by its users—allowing people to really quickly show their friends what they're upto—as people were no longer posting as much as they did in the initial days of the app. And Stories was the evolution they had to make in order to recapture the job people originally hired Instagram for.\n\n### Web3 social apps\n\nThere are a lot of developers trying to build a web3 social network in recent days. As stated above, social apps are generally extremely hard to build. Web3 versions of Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube won’t make any difference to the end-user if there’s no strong value proposition other than being decentralized, and permissionless. The value of these giant social networks lies in their content library and the social graph and trying to replace them requires more than just decentralization. Rather, a verticalized web3 social app serving a specific niche (e.g. [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) for crypto-curious folks) or a fresh, new social app built on web3 with a completely new content format and social dynamics might work.\n\nAgain, social apps are hard enough to get off the ground and requiring users to setup a wallet to use the app and making them approve wallet transactions for repeating actions (e.g. confirming a transaction just to like a post) will further reduce the already low probability of success. It can only be made possible if the decentralization & interoperability of the on-chain record is coupled with the seamless experience of off-chain systems.\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nI've just scratched the surface of what constitutes a successful social app. There are a lot of other things that come into consideration when building a social network. But having said all this, most social apps are born unintentionally and out of accidents.\n\nBy and large, innovative products aren’t strategically imagined ahead of time – they’re stumbled upon while experimenting on the go. Instagram was a pivot from Burbn, Twitter spun out of Odeo, Facebook was originally Facemash, BuzzFeed evolved from one of many “for fun” experiments — the list goes on and on. Tomorrow, a high school kid can strike the right idea, break all the rules and still go on to rise to the top with their new creation as a result of luck or timing. Such is the space!\n\nIf you are building in the space or thinking about the future of web3 social, I’d love to chat.

It needs community, virality, and impact.\n\nCrowdfunding isn’t anything new. Everyone by now has seen that one high school friend’s GoFundMe post on \\[add your social of choice\\]. And if you have no idea what I’m talking about, you should consider renting out that rock you’ve been living under.\n\nEveryone thinks they know what crowdfunding is, but what actually comes to mind is their uncle’s RV fund or Star Citizen’s “final” release. Did you know modern crowdfunding was actually started by a British rock band from the 90s?\n\nCrowdfunding can be traced back several centuries, but modern crowdfunding — the kind with more than just the village folk pitching in for a new well — was pioneered by the British rock band, [Marillion](https://youtu.be/GA4ROLQF4cs). **\\[🔴USE HEADPHONES for BEST EXPERIENCE🔴\\]**\n\n[https://media.giphy.com/media/xT1Ra1KAzLm1KUo4zS/giphy.mp4](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT1Ra1KAzLm1KUo4zS/giphy.mp4)\n\nIt was London in the 1980s. The streets lined with Farrah Fawcett hair while kids watched Dynasty on the telly, and punks were “[bumming fags](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/the-surprisingly-complex-legacy-of-brits-saying-bum-a-fag)” in their leather jackets. All the while, Marillion was still playing progressive rock… long after it lost its popularity.\n\nDespite this, “Kayleigh” and “Lavender,” from the 1985 album *Misplaced Childhood,* landed them on the Top 10 hits in the U.K. They maintained a level of relevance following this through all the 80s, much thanks to their cult following. But they were finally dropped by their record label in 1995. They continued to play and produce music for their fans through indie labels, but these were all bad deals for them.\n\nIt was in ‘97, with the early internet, that fans asked them to tour through the States. Marillion couldn’t afford the $60,000 price tag to make it happen. But that’s when their fans offered to raise the money. 💡\n\nThey knew a guy in North Carolina who could escrow the money raised for them (people just *had a guy for that* in the 90s, apparently). And in just a few weeks, they raised $20,000 on their way to their goal. As the keyboardist Mark Kelly tells it, “That was the beginning of crowdfunding for us — and for every band, really.”\n\nThe rest is a tale as old as time. They were able to continue crowdfunding for albums and events. Pledge Music even took the idea as their business model and worked with them to release another album in 2016.\n\n[https://media.giphy.com/media/4LwKrBfFQgBaw/giphy.mp4](https://media.giphy.com/media/4LwKrBfFQgBaw/giphy.mp4)\n\nYeah, yeah. The point here is that crowdfunding started as an organic experiment of people who shared a passion. Crowdfunding today is much more sophisticated, with different types that include donation-based, debt-based, equity-based, and reward-based crowdfunding.\n\nThe common trait between them that’s still the same as Marillion’s first crowdfund is that the most successful campaigns always have a group of passionate participants. People who believe in the same goal and who want to be a part of it.\n\nBut there’s a lot of competition these days since crowdfunding has grown into its own fully-fledged industry. Even books and guides on the topic is an industry unto itself. And what you’ll learn by reading these books and guides is that there’s as much prep work involved as the the campaign itself.\n\nLearning your market, practicing your pitch, appealing to your audience, and, most importantly, building your community.\n\nThis hasn’t changed since the 90s, *but* we recently upgraded it with Incentive-based Crowdfunding, the newest type. This makes it possible for any creator of any size to raise the funding they need *and* bootstrap enough community support to get their name out there.\n\nTo get to sharp end of the needle, when you raise money, your biggest supporters earn alongside with you. You can set aside 5, 10, 25, even 100% of the funds to redistribute to the top three fans who broadcast your crowdfund loudest. If you have a community, they have the chance to blast your name and earn a living doing it. If you don’t have one, you now have a way to incentivize anyone on the world wide web to get your name out there, even before your project’s available.\n\nI wrote [a separate article](https://mirror.xyz/0xb3212858908c726353887278409d209F17e9d386/IyxebLyo60UL8OJAPj3Xcy0fopQxICgdiqOOphNxS1s) that goes into more detail on how you can set this up for your project today on [MintGate](https://www.mintgate.io/). We want to create a place where anyone can get their project off the ground and build their community. Content is the resource that never runs out of supply but is always in demand, and there aren’t enough places online for creators to make a living sharing it.\n\nOur goal is to be that place. A place where the algorithm doesn’t direct traffic, value does. A place where virality and impact boil down to community and passion.

The DAO is now able to create an on-chain governance framework, allowing for proposal creation and community voting— submitted, published, and executed on EVM compatible chains like Polygon. Additionally they will have streamlined access to token issuance for governance, including customizable tokens and practical token distribution with configurable distribution schedule. \n\nFor H.E.R.DAO members, they will now have seamless access to easy on-chain transactions with reduced gas fees using their existing wallets. There are also enhanced member engagement features that allow H.E.R.DAO governors and members to manage asset holdings, browse featured or followed DAO’s proposals, social posts and ongoing events, as well as participate in voting, discussion forums and public profile tracking.\n\nWith Verse, DAO projects can seamlessly and execute their governance on-chain with minimal fees. The Verse team is excited to partner with H.E.R.DAO to further the organization’s goals through our suite of DAO governance tooling. \n\n**About Clique**\n\nClique, a hub for DAOs, enhances member participation and engagement in DAOs through a single platform for everything DAO related whether it be voting, proposals, social posts, analytics, token management etc. Clique will help alleviate the fragmentation of DAO tooling which is a major obstacle for common users to actively participate in DAOs. One single dashboard for users to manage all their DAO activities and absorb all the information & updates from their DAOs. \n\n**About H.E.R.DAO**\n\nH.E.R. is a womxn-centered developer DAO that includes self-identifying women, trans women and non-binary audiences. Our goal is to sustainably diversify the blockchain ecosystem, leading to more versatile product & venture development within. \n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1656099503, "digest": "ANniGjP5f9BLhwA9pYabSej5eZHhydD3BNifqY149dE", "contributor": "0xB9d761AF53845D1F3C68f99c38f4dB6fcCfB66A1"}

Cut through any sections you deem unnecessary. Expect mistakes. And feel free to reach out if there’s anything I can help clarify.\n\n# Market Dynamics\n\n### Price Instability\n\nTokens today are launched with little regard to price stability. Teams attempt to manifest value into existence, launching tokens out of thin air, backed by nothing save the wispy dreams of electric sheep. By the most popular playbook, teams use emissions to bootstrap their communities and incentivize the creation of liquidity pools around a token. It’s common for emission schedules to double the circulating supply over the period of months to the benefit of holders and stakers. But without sufficiently large supply sinks to offset these emissions the growth of token supply outpaces that of protocol utility (demand).\n\nThe result is a devaluation of currency.\n\nTrends during the crypto bull market have made it clear: retail investors.. don’t do math, at least not far beyond the spreadsheeting of APRs across yield farms.**¹** Those that do are in the minority, but even the math-pilled pile into projects with little regard for “fundamentals” during periods of exuberance. It’s the dominant strategy—to don the WAGMI banner—in the upswing of a bull run.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CO2O2JSodS95lZs-DHwMc.jpg?height=1123&width=2022)\n\nHowever, some classes of tokens require more attention than others, especially under the umbrella of DeFi. In particular, unpermissioned stablecoin protocols demand greater sophistication in their mechanism design to successfully peg the price of a token against shifting demand. Protocol investors *should* have a strong grasp of tokenomics before making the leap. Protocol designers even more so.\n\nBut clearly that hasn’t been the case.\n\nBased on how much was lost through Terra-centered products ([\\~$40B](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/15/the-collapse-of-terra-was-devastating-but-there-is-still-hope-for-crypto/#:\\~:text=The%20short%20of%20it%20is,billion%20of%20value%20was%20lost.)), many failed to evaluate the design of $UST and $LUNA, even ***locking*** significant capital atop a stablecoin protocol pegged using a single speculative asset. Even cursory analysis would have revealed a printing press vulnerable to inflationary feedback loops when run in reverse, yet investments poured in at an institutional scale. Maybe it was excessive exuberance, maybe overconfidence in a narrative peddled by the Luna team. After all, social signals pointed towards Do Kwon’s balls being massive enough to hold it all together, even through a bank run.\n\n![the only thing reliably pegged by the LFG were the investors](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BzrA6tNS2tjdIs1nrFz6O.png?height=509&width=977)\n\nHere we see one of our supposedly sophisticated founders nuking the collective bank account. What does this say about the rest of us? We’re mecha-broke, founders and investors alike. The result is a broad mis-pricing of speculative assets in the short term where the price history becomes a meme in itself. And though meme investments can mint millionaires to the beat of a printer, they tend to implode when the music grinds to a halt. Bear market dynamics bring it all back down to earth, instead minting one financial tragedy after another 🎭\n\n### Bear Market Behaviors\n\n*Skip this section if you’re familiar with the current macroeconomic landscape*\n\nWe live in interesting times. Just look around. Technological advancements at break-neck speeds: [genomics](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology), [energy production](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2308243-deepmind-uses-ai-to-control-plasma-inside-tokamak-fusion-reactor/), [natural language models](https://gpt3demo.com/apps/openai-gpt-3-playground), [text-to-generative-art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3_LD3R_Ygs), [satellite imagery](https://www.planet.com/), [financial markets independent of central authority](https://uniswap.org/).

And a global military pillar threatening the reintroduction of tactical nukes on the battlefield to top it all off.\n\nOh by the way, the Federal Reserve of the World’s reserve currency expanded its money supply by several trillion dollars in the face of a global pandemic. Seems almost mundane by comparison, doesn’t it? The scale is difficult to conceptualize. Not exactly a head-turner outside of fin-pilled circles. But its effect on the markets was hard to miss, manifesting the V-shaped market recovery so many wished for, if only for a fever dream.\n\n![M2 money supply in the U.S., 10 years](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CIe0vSI4pC9mljo3c4-8C.png?height=774&width=1520)\n\nMuch of this money went directly into the largest securities markets in the form of Quantitative Easing (i.e. the Fed went on a shopping spree). Back at the start of the pandemic, the Fed poured an initial $700B then $120B/mo into treasury and mortgage-backed securities, only tapering off their purchases at the turn of this year with a balance sheet nearly $5T higher than when they started. These markets, the once beloved playgrounds of yield-guaranteeing hedge funds, grew artificially inflated, pricing out investors who could no longer expect to generate the ”guaranteed returns” they had promised their clients.\n\nYou can analogize the effect as a fat man eying a hot tub. He waddles over and sits down, raising the water level around him. He slumps in deeper, and the water begins to pour over the sides. Well, this water (money) had to find a new home. And it flooded into the smaller neighboring hot tubs (e.g. stonk market) in search of alpha, cascading even to venture capital, private equity and cryptocurrencies. Couple this with COVID relief funds distributed across the board and the maturation of financial products centered around crypto assets. The result was DeFi summer. A perfect summer storm of otherworldly gains, bequeathing freedom to the rare breed of degenerates that “take profits.”\n\nBut the recent pullback of the Fed under the shadow of persistent inflationary signals has brought financial markets to capitulation. As the fat man stands back up, the waves of excess capital seemingly ebb and vanish into financial aether. And as the fat man executes its hawkish maneuvers, ratcheting up interest rates and such, investment firms readjust their growth valuation models, pull out of liquid investments and search for reentry into a market where the new normal is defined at a lower level. In this transition, (3, 3) often flips to (3, -3) in a cruel chapter of stakeholder misalignment.\n\n[https://twitter.com/devdoteth/status/1529121002914979840?s=21&t=RQht8WxwyuVQtnSSOe6EHA](https://twitter.com/devdoteth/status/1529121002914979840?s=21&t=RQht8WxwyuVQtnSSOe6EHA)\n\nAnd for several projects, this market shift coincides with the end of lockup periods where teams and investors have vested significant portions of the token supply. From a purely financial perspective it’s in their best interest to dump their bags. After all, there’s no glory in a graveyard. No collateral value from a golden heart.\n\n# Collateral as Resilience\n\n### StableCoins, a Brief\n\nS*kip this if you’re familiar with the top stablecoin projects*\n\nOne class of tokens has been largely immune to the onset of the bear market: collateralized stablecoins. $USDT, $USDC and $BUSD, respectively, are the leaders by market capitalization. The first two are collateralized by obfuscated assets, largely traditional, while the third is collateralized directly with USD. Pegged to the price of tradFi’s premier reserve currency, they offer a safe haven from the volatility native to our emergent ecosystems.\n\nHowever, the three can hardly be considered decentralized given their permissioned model of issuance. Rather, they’re a necessary stopgap for stability in the transition to a decentralized financial system. And in that regard, $DAI and $FRAX are more relevant to the price analysis of collateralized stablecoins.\n\n![Top stablecoins by market cap (coinmarketcap 06Jun22)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E4KQj63jzKVFJPDVLd0eZ.png?height=532&width=1376)\n\nMaker’s $DAI is interesting because a significant portion of its collateral is comprised of volatile on-chain assets. It stays solvent through price fluctuations of its collateral, by requiring borrowers to over-collateralize into a protocol-controlled Maker Vault when minting/borrowing $DAI. So holders of $DAI can rest easy knowing that even if their collateral loses value their $DAI will not, since the protocol automatically liquidates collateral in its Vaults to stay solvent. At the time of writing, the protocol holds \\~$10.6B of collateral to back an outstanding supply of \\~6.9B $DAI, a collateral ratio (CR) of \\~150% in this period of volatility.\n\n$FRAX on the other hand is under-collateralized. It achieves greater capital efficiency than its peers through a fractionally algorithmic approach to stabilization. The team’s core innovations in their first version of the protocol were (1) a sliding CR for $FRAX according to price pressures on the open market and (2) incentivized swapping between $FRAX and $FXS + $USDC, based on the market price of their governance token $FXS. If this sounds familiar, it’s because (2) is a similar mechanic to Luna’s printer, only with significant $USDC as stable collateral and fewer memes about testicular gravity wells.²\n\n### Lessons in Price Controls\n\ns*kip if you understand the core mechanisms of both $DAI and $FRAX*\n\nDespite their permissionless issuance, both $DAI and $FRAX have held their peg to fractions of a cent through the recent implosion of prominent peer protocol Luna.³\n\n![$FRAX, max price deviation during Luna debacle (https://app.frax.finance)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_hFz-mZS-GBGtXD-KT30X.png?height=377&width=797)\n\nThey’ve managed this through what one could roughly describe as collateral-based supply controls. In $DAI’s case a borrower’s collateral is automatically exchanged for the outstanding balance of $DAI on the open market when a Vault breaches the lower bound on the acceptable CR. The purchased $DAI is then burned, decreasing the total supply of $DAI, and any remaining collateral is returned to the borrower in its original form. With sufficient buffer room, collateral locked in the protocol always stays above the outstanding balance and can be used to contract the supply of $DAI as needed.\n\nBut $DAI is capital inefficient, even less-so than its centralized counterparts. In $FRAX’s case there are multiple mechanisms, which you can read about [here](https://docs.frax.finance/price-stability), that dictate the protocol’s CR and supply based on price pressures. When demand for $FRAX drops, sustaining price below peg, the protocol increases the target CR and contracts supply through a marginally incentivized exchange between $USDC + $FXS <=> $FRAX. $USDC comes from the protocol’s reserves and $FXS is minted according to market rates.\n\nSo how did the Luna-inspired market crash affect the price of of these two tokens? Well, it didn’t really. Instead, we saw sharp contractions in the supply of both tokens, as expected by the design of their respective protocols.\n\n![$FRAX supply 1 year (https://app.frax.finance)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/r1lLt0QYDRE9NQ4qfqt4G.png?height=447&width=798)\n\n![$DAI supply 1 year (https://makerburn.com/#/charts/dai)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LqzMF9dssqnlIvRAF1qB0.png?height=492&width=1253)\n\nThese protocols are able to maintain peg by contracting supply in times of reduced demand. For $DAI the influence of supply contraction is less obvious as the borrowed $DAI is overcollateralized, so Vault balances are always assumed solvent to a market redemption of $DAI at $1. For our undercollateralized counterpart however, supply controls are crucial. They’re used to balance the current supply of $FRAX against its market demand and maintain the price at peg.\n\nCompare this with other classes of tokens, examples of which have dropped 80-95% from peak through this market cycle. Of course, price stability isn’t the highest priority for many of these tokens, and operating near full-collateral as stablecoin projects do would hinder a team’s ability to scale their networks quickly. That being said, under no twisted narrative can a 90% drawdown in a protocol’s primary financial vehicle be a good thing for its community. Quite the contrary. Our bagholders now self-identify as down/tremendously.\n\nIf collateral-based supply controls can enable a protocol to maintain its token within half a percent of its price target in a major market meltdown, it’s not hard to imagine one could employ the same tools to design mechanisms meeting looser stability requirements.\n\nLet’s explore the tradeoffs after a quick detour through the author’s childhood.\n\n# Inspired Mechanisms\n\n### The Drug Market of Neochibis (role of the shopkeep)\n\ns*kip if familiar with price windows (tl;dr shopkeep = mint/burn contract)*\n\nThere are several ways to augment an open market economy for greater price stability, and they derive inspiration from market structures common to game economies.\n\nAn example:\n\n![our local drug dealer (left) with our friend an0n (right)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5F84BI3Bsi1KErwvFYo59.png?height=1010&width=1380)\n\nWe can imagine the Orange Potions ($OP) from the above shop window circulating through the Maplestory economy. Without the presence of a shopkeep, our players are free to trade $OP with one another at any agreed upon price. The price of $OP can fluctuate, unbounded, up, down and sideways, based on the balance of supply and demand of $OP on the open market. An0n, our savvy Maple investor, starts hoarding $OP as a modest increase in new players has her bullish on the projected shift in demand for these very mid potions.\n\nBut MMORPGs are at the mercy of their publishers, and Nexon (Maplestory’s publisher) decides they want to make the game more n00b friendly by drastically increasing the potion drop rate for Orange Mushrooms, a spawn commonly hunted at lower levels.⁴\n\nThis is disastrous for An0n who took out a second mortgage on her studio flat in downtown Kerning City in an attempt to corner the supply of $OP on the market. Now the new cohort of players farms a surplus, rather than a deficit in their misadventures. More than enough to negate their personal consumption. An accumulation of excess reserves. Consequently, an increasing supply of $OP now floods the market, and if An0n hasn’t dumped her bags yet, they’re likely going to 0. Poore An0n.\n\n![would you like an $OP an0n? they’re cheeaaapp](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Es2zS4566LXvoGvrb6eu.jpg?height=1156&width=2205)\n\nShe’s jolted awake in a cold sweat. Just a bad dream.\n\nAs she gains her bearings and recovers from the shock, An0n remembers that Maplestory employs shopkeeps, shopkeeps who will always purchase $OP from any user at the price of 80meso. This price of 80meso is what we call a **price floor** on $OP: a market structure where a central authority acts as the buyer of last resort, preventing the market price of an asset from falling below a threshold. If the fair market price of $OP were to fall to 75meso, for example, players would instead exchange their $OP with the shopkeep for 80meso. Because why the hell wouldn’t they?\n\nOf course, this does nothing to recover the actual fair price of $OP and serves to suppress price discovery. These are the same criticisms leveled against our federal governments when they threaten Yield Curve Control or meddle with the price of Corporate Bonds as they did through the Pandemic. But we digress. Let’s just keep in mind that our Maplestory shopkeeps are in cahoots with Nexon and have infinite reserves of fake money at their disposal.⁵ They can’t be “bankrupt” buying infinite supplies of $OP or $COPE like our web3 protocols can.\n\n![you laugh, but i’ve met IRL drugs less addicting](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0AZQPNuqPGnEmAXm_6PTu.png?height=362&width=2522)\n\nSo An0n is always guaranteed an exit price of 80mesos per $OP.  Maybe she  *should*  take out a second mortgage.  After all, it’s 2007, Maplestory is new, Maplestory is HOT, and an influx of new players is inevitable. She checks the price of $OP on her toji-terminal. Eh. She powers it down and goes back to sleep. Why?\n\nWell, $OP is currently trading at 150meso. And, yes, she assumes a fair amount of downside risk even with the price floor, but if her investment hypothesis on Maple hotness is correct this shouldn’t be cause for too much concern. After all, it’s not like the world’s falling into financial crisis anytime soon. She expects the price to go up, hopefully moon, just as the price of her home has these last few years. Her bigger concern is the **price ceiling**. Our shopkeeps don’t just buy $OP at 80meso. They also *sell* $OP at 160meso, rain or shine, all day. every day. dey some hustlers fr. nd business, is bussin.\n\nThis caps An0n’s upside at just 10meso a pop. She runs some quick maths and decides it’s not worth the closing costs of refinancing. A stearn decision.\n\n![if the price of $OP ever falls breaches either bound of the price window, users will instead trade with our shopkeep at the bound price](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rZUARECBTwj0miG32RoWV.jpg?height=1166&width=2113)\n\nThe market structure we see here is called a **price window**: bounded above by a price ceiling and below by a price floor. The market price of $OP can fluctuate to any price within this window, but it cannot breech the ceiling or floor set by the Nexon Pharma Cartel. For the sake of discussion, we’ll refer to these market structures more broadly as ‘mechanisms’ for their ease of incorporation into tokenomic models as composable building blocks.\n\n### Continuous Token Models: What, Why & What?\n\ns*kip if hip to continuous token models*\n\nIn the prior crypto bull run (c. 2017), several people floated the notion of [Continuous Token Models](https://medium.com/@simondlr/tokens-2-0-curved-token-bonding-in-curation-markets-1764a2e0bee5) (CTM). A method of token issuance open to the public, directly from a contract, infinitely scalable and price-pegged to a reserve currency(token). This model largely fell flat as founders preferred full mint and total control over their supply from the get go. The idea of fixed supply was also more attractive to institutional investors, who pushed founders to mirror the model laid forth by L1s and coomed at the mere mouthing of the words  *deflationary  token  model*.\n\nBut what use is a “capped supply” or “deflationary model” when the circulating supply is aggressively expanded through emissions? Not even the price is helped. All this serves is to disproportionately reward those earliest to a protocol, with relatively tight timelines and rates arbitrarily chosen upfront by founders who  *I imagine*  have limited experience divining the future. That’s not the kind of hand we desire. Inadvertently gatekeeping and heavily penalizing the mass of adopters to come, more or less for having been born a bit later (sound familiar?).\n\nYes, as founders, we want to incentivize adoption, we want to reward those who are early. But handing out tokens to wallets, simply for already having tokens is not only lazy, it’s self serving. Given you can plug “20% for founding team” to virtue signal on a pitch deck, then turn around to reap half the “60% for community” allocation through token-holder emissions. The game is almost comical at a distance. Up close, it’s rather disturbing.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jyzgbw4msoiQQy5UyHdiC.jpg?height=884&width=2080)\n\nSo it’s not clear yet whether this model can surface as the chosen modus operandi among protocol founders. It takes humility to decline a throne. An inhuman level of discipline when the option of  accepting-absurd-amounts-of-capital-pre-product-for-a-shot-at-blitzscaling-on-network-effects  exists. Understandable. So maybe this stagflation collab with our economy is just what we need, a ratcheting up of rates 1970s style to shed leverage and force a dry-up of institutional investment for risk-on ventures.\n\nFor communities, though, CTMs are the superior funding model, no doubt. They sidestep the steep token discounts VCs receive compared to the retail investor and offer greater price stability than the massive legal step-functions of liquidity granted to founding teams and their VCs today. In this early stage of the new internet, token markets cannot reasonably handle such massive fluctuations to circulating supply, not when they outright eclipse the morsels of utility offered by the protocol.\n\n![How. Many. Times.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/rb3XJ2k5hnDD_0l6ZEUuW.jpg?height=1189&width=1857)\n\nSo what is this alternative? What is the bonding curve?⁶\n\nWell, the bonding curve is the heart of the continuous token model. It’s the mapping between input and output. The redlining tachometer begging you to shift gears, to expand supply in times of over-exuberance and contract when the market begs for mercy. The bonding curve is a cushion for the fall. A dampening function on the price movement of shitcoins.\n\nThe bonding curve is a last line of defense for an unassuming market. A rate limit atop the shifting sands of demand. A countercultural force in the supply curve. A policy against economic violence. Padding for our overeager retail investor, the everyman, the laboring protocol participant. All discouraged by their imploding portfolios. The bonding curve is a solution to an acute problem. The bonding curve is..\n\n![mint-side linear bonding curve (https://thegraph.academy/curators/introduction-to-bonding-curves/)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nvBPvOaKZl8GuPYWzuLji.png?height=1064&width=2120)\n\nThe bonding curve is the shopkeep in your favorite MMORPG, selling $OP at 160meso and buying it back at 80meso. She sets the price window of a token by offering mint and burn prices in respect to a reserve token, **meso** in this case. Only on-chain, the shopkeep is free to update prices by her discretion, according to contract, guided by the invisible hand.\n\nDiscretionary pricing based on the time of day, market volatility or even the token balances of your wallet are all possible. Most sensibly though, most effectively and elegantly, in the name of the Holy Spirit, that which is dynamic price stability, price should be dependent on the current supply of the minted token. We’ll explore why in a moment. But given these axes, the X and the Y, the bonding curve’s mission—its purpose—is to bound the token within a price window, given current supply.\n\n# Technically Speaking\n\n### Monomial Curves, Shapes and Uses\n\ns*kip if sublinear curve stan*\n\nConsider the monomial function `p(x) = x^a` as a candidate for our equation; the equation that maps token supply to price, the foundation of our CTM Bonding Curve.\n\nThe real mapping will look something like `p(x) = k * x^a`, or for the burn curve `p_b(x) = r * k * x^a`, where `0 < r < 1`. But we can trim the fat to  `x^a` for the sake of analysis since `k` and `r` are assumed constant. Assuming also that `a` is positive, there are 4 distinct shapes our monomial curve can assume:\n\n![(A) Constant  (B) Linear  (C) Sublinear  (D) Superlinear – starring some home-cooked diagrams.. bear with me](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-rX8BQIFRNIpKO29sqVp7.jpeg?height=1231&width=1455)\n\nOur CTM Bonding Curve dictates the price window of the token underpinning our protocol’s entire economy. So though our expression may be simple, it speaks volumes. The nuances matter, and it’s worth hearing what each of these shapes have to say about themselves.\n\n**Constant: King**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nFxXPFBBpGHigjz7ocxvs.jpeg?height=689&width=1551)\n\nLet’s start with the constant curve, where a = 0, simplified to `p(x) = x^0 = 1`. A flat line across supply. By analogy, the constant curve is our King. By divine right, the King decrees the price of a token. She is absolute and holds steadfast to her decrees. Her exchange rate is law, regardless of how the supply may grow or shrink.\n\nKings are most common in video games. Take our Maplestory shopkeep, for example. She sets her price window at 160/80 and doesn’t look back. Rain or shine, surplus or squeeze, those are her rates. Take it or leave it.\n\nIn the real world, Kings are rare. Kings are iconic. What’s the going rate for a can of Arizona Green Tea? How about a Costco Hot Dog? Did you have to search up either? No, you didn’t. Because these are Kings, steadfast and absolute, unlike fallen Kings of old such as McDonald’s 20pc Chicken McNuggets or dollar stores that once held some sliver of integrity.⁷ But King status in the physical world is always temporary. Even the mighty Costco Hot Dog will eventually bow to price hikes. After all, these goods are denominated in inflationary fiat. It’s not that they’ll necessarily “cost” more. It’s just.. your money will be  ✨ worth.less ✨\n\nOn-chain, however, this pattern is more common. In fact, one major class of tokens leans into the constant curve as a personality trait, a core identity even. Stablecoins, as discussed above, are the quintessential example. Though nearly all stablecoin protocols innovate beyond the simple constant curve, at their core, they aspire towards a shared philosophy: X dollars in, X dollars out. *Rain or shine, surplus or squeeze, those are their rates. Take it or leave it.* What we refer to as a “peg”, quite simply put, is a very narrow price window, either codified into law or incentivized by a protocol through various mechanisms.⁸\n\n**Linear: Jack**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S-Nx3v-mgHOle9K170F43.jpeg?height=741&width=1556)\n\nNext up is the Linear curve, our Jack, our Knave. Here `a=1`, `p(x) = x`. A simple soldier, really. Easy to understand. Easy to implement. With the Jack, price increases in consistent lockstep with supply. He cares that our early adopters are rewarded for the risk they assume. And not much else.\n\nOur Jack is the first of the bunch whom one would describe as **monotonically increasing**, a shmancy way of saying that as X increases, so does Y. Under the context of our mapping between supply and price, all this means is that the earlier you are, the less it costs to mint. Unlike our constant curve, this positive price mapping allows token price, rather than just token supply, to absorb shifts in demand. In essence, price is allowed to increase and encourage earlier investment. \\~A reason to ape in\\~\n\nBut we can do more than just incentivize early investment. The nuance of *how much* our curve increases along the mint is important.\n\n**Sublinear: Ace**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/CH8RqKtzXidj0hGn3FwfK.jpeg?height=696&width=1641)\n\nAnd for that reason, the Sublinear Curve is our Ace. It’s a curve that adapts its qualities depending on the needs of a protocol. The derivative of price over supply is relatively high early on in a project’s lifetime, when utility is low; we see large increases to the token’s price with each new mint. This encourages early adoption and offers teams minting on the low-low for their initial batch of tokens, so long as they don’t mint too much.⁹\n\nAs we further expand supply, the rate of change decreases. The slope levels off to near zero as the project matures and reaches a larger supply. This expansion to near zero means that, once matured, our sublinear curve begins to look a lot like our constant curve. Our Ace requires larger and larger shifts in supply to meaningfully impact the price window. And supply, rather than price, absorbs the fluctuations to token demand. However, that isn’t to say that a mature protocol’s token would be unviable for investment. The token’s price-growth may be slowed, but the price is free to scale to the limits of code.\n\nThe beauty of the monomial is that the shape looks the same, no matter how much you zoom in or zoom out. That is to say, a X% increase in supply will always result in a Y% increase in mint price, no matter the current supply. `(1.1x)^a = (1.1)^a * x^a` no matter what x is.\n\n**Superlinear: Joker**\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2HHZSJ7chI8Pa3koCXJMJ.jpeg?height=750&width=1555)\n\nYou expected a Queen, but it’s hard confer any sense of reverence to this curve. So instead, we present the Joker. Why? Because the Joker is hard to understand, in a  *why the fuck would you do that?*   kinda way.\n\nThe Joker speaks to your greed, lulls you in with promises of riches, only to shoot you in the head, then burn the massive pile of cash you’ve donated to his heist. The Joker may be easy to implement on chain, as simple as a single `EXP` operation, elegant even. But your dance with the court fool only ends in disaster. It’s utterly bewildering why anyone would trust the Joker, and how anyone could endorse this maniac in their writing.\n\nOur Joker takes everything good about our Ace and inverses the play. Starting with a painfully slow creep in token price, only to shoot price volatility through the roof as a project matures. With an increasingly volatile price and a promise of riches, one can intuit the inevitable rug and resulting price history for any token achieving “adoption” through this approach. It exudes a scent reminiscent of pre-PMF high-burn blitzscale attempts. And though you may enjoy some smokiness to your dishes, it’s ill-advised to accept excessive charring in your portfolio.\n\nQuite simply, anyone playing the Joker is either a fool or a Ponzi masquerading as one, attempting to forcefully divine hypergrowth across the wrong dimensions.\n\nBut even the Joker has a redeeming trait: He promises founders cheaper token-capital than any of his counterparts, a lower relative mint price. It’s an offer hard to decline. After all, the hockey-stick curve triggers a pavlovian response from the best of us. It’s investor-primal. But wipe off that drool and remember: hockey-stick success is something measured over time, not supply. Price stabilization in maturity is a *good* thing, both for longterm investment and protocol health. Tokens aren’t just investment equity. They’re a stake in the ecosystem of value being created, a means of procuring and rewarding utility under the context of a protocol.\n\n### (supply) Based Price Controls\n\ns*kip if gigabrain econ chad*\n\nSo, great. We like the Ace. Makes sense. And we can mint new tokens along this sublinear price curve. But why bother with the whole window.. why burn tokens at all?\n\n![don’t know where i found this bottom line but i’m keeping him](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/19vwAMYq50nivG8cZ4eBl.jpg?height=1170&width=2080)\n\nGood question, An0n. Remember our stablecoins from earlier? Remember how they maintained a strict peg, even through a market meltdown? How’d they manage that?\n\nThat’s right, our stablecoin protocols maintained peg by contracting supply. They were able to maintain their price pegs by adjusting the supply of their token in accordance to the drop in demand. Of course, $FRAX and $DAI had their own mechanisms for doing so, less direct than the shopkeep’s, but similar in effect. Following the $UST debacle, the increase in market volatility and decrease in stablecoin confidence generated substantial sell pressure for these tokens. If their circulating supplies had remained constant through the ordeal, it’s unlikely either would have kept peg.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qnJynYckPs90d719gl8ix.jpg?height=1047&width=2044)\n\nIt’s simple economics, ackshually. At any point in time, the price of an asset is determined by the balance between supply and demand for the asset. Intuitively, we understand that when overall demand drops, price also drops, given supply remains constant. Abstracted, this is a left shift in the demand curve, as seen above.\n\nOur protocols have limited tools in their arsenal to influence demand in these situations. They can only list to Coinbase so many times. Only conduct so many psyop campaigns until CT catches on. So assuming we have negligible control over the demand, we have one option: supply controls.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zXkapPBGjtFxasDYKW6P8.jpg?height=1170&width=2040)\n\nIf it all sounds a bit magical, think about it this way: if all the sellers dump their bags on the shopkeep, who’s left to dump on the market? Nobody. Assuming our whales are savvy™ they’ll dump their bags on the buyer with the highest offer. In the case where market price breaches the current price floor, that would be the bonding curve contract. Our contract helps stabilize price by removing sellers from the market, absorbing some of the sell pressure by reducing circulating supply as sellers choose to burn their tokens rather than trade it with their peers. Buyers are then forced to engage at lower supply with the remaining sellers, achieving equilibrium at a higher price.\n\n![not drawing another one of those](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VEeJl_Ou5_rDHLJipRQ1t.png?height=344&width=612)\n\nNow, let’s flip script and consider what happens on the other end of the window, when excess demand for the token pushes the price beyond the ceiling. Buyers, of course, would rather transact with a shopkeep offering tokens at lower-than-market rates, leaving our sellers to match at lower prices in the face of expanding supply. That is one major tradeoff of the continuous token model; it serves as a neutral party, reducing price volatility in both directions. It’s worth noting, though, that the price window of the contract shifts in the opposite direction of the dampening, allowing for progression of price in line with the market’s will.\n\nThis occurs passively from the perspective of the protocol. The shopkeep here is just a contract that anyone can interact with, to exchange derivative tokens for a reserve token and vice versa. To this end, the shopkeep also serves as a treasury of funds (1) to honor redemptions across the burn curve and (2) to hold any balance in excess of the burn curve, the unallocated area between mint and burn curves.\n\n### Fractional Reserve Requirements\n\n*5% pleasure, 50% pain, 100% rant to remember the game*\n\nLet’s ignore the burn curve for a moment; or rather, set it equal to the mint curve. Consider the properties of the reserve being created here in relation to the bonding curve. Though I doubt the math-pilled among you would have trouble following along, we’ll skip the calculus for now, a show of mercy to the broader audience. So forget the math. Just take a look at these colorful charts.\n\n![max reserve ratio for sublinear curves fall between 50-100%](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Zuhe5SP9tTZj8iHuXNByG.jpg?height=1135&width=2022)\n\nThe rectangular area is the market capitalization of the token at the existing supply. The area under the curve is the size of the reserve. The maximum reserve ratio then, given the shape of the curve, would be 100% for constant, 50% for linear and anything along this spectrum for the sublinear curves we could produce. Where along this line do most protocols lie today? That’s right, 0. They’re not on the spectrum, and that’s a problem. Earlier, we disparaged the Joker for the absurd stabilization mechanism he offered. 0 is worse than that. 0 is a house of cards. 0 is free fall from a magic carpet ride when valuations are mismatched against reality.\n\n![POV: rugged during a magic carpet ride](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T6azr5wic--Yx4WcINpkI.jpg?height=941&width=1206)\n\nToday we see protocols attempting to mint entire economies out of thin air. Why? Because training wheels don’t make for a great sales pitch. They limit speed. And investors like speed, not safety features. They don’t understand safety features. Because safety isn’t sexy. Safety doesn’t lead to hypergrowth. Safety doesn’t blitzscale. Safety isn’t what VCs crave. What VCs crave is exit liquidity. Better-than-market deals. And we’ve been groomed to give it to them, in exorbitant amounts, at the cost our own (protocol) health.\n\nSo resilience isn’t attractive, not when the money is sloshing around. Resilience is the antithesis of just-in-time manufacturing, the enemy of “capital efficiency” misaligned towards hypergrowth. And we’re leaving no slack for the swans. Instead we’re doing what’s sexy. Minting our entire supplies from the get go, signing criminal term sheets for capital and accepting praise when the temporarily constrained supply squeezes our tokens to the moon. Well, those criminal term sheets are coming back to haunt you, anon. And no amount of holy water or salt can exorcise the skeletons in your closet.\n\nOf course, this isn’t to advocate for a 100% reserve ratio. A full reserve ratio is overkill in almost every circumstance. We’re not (all) out here architecting stablecoins after all. But wouldn’t it be nice to hit a veranda or two when hurdling towards Gaia at terminal velocity over Agrabah? Who knows. If one slows us down, maybe two can keep us out of her eternal embrace. Maybe the palace guards *won’t* find us strewn across the Bazaar come daybreak, a colorful collection of body parts, dripped and dribbled in red from the inside out.\n\n![R = Reserve Requirement, T = Treasury Balance, S = Discretionary Spending](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Al75c4LIgnMP-1zbAfuAS.png?height=2714&width=4030)\n\nWe’ve discussed max reserve ratios for each of these shapes, but those assume the mint and burn curves are one and the same. The above setups leave no room for a token to trade on the open market, as buyers and sellers must matchmake within the gap of the shopkeep’s mint and burn prices. A gap must exist to allow for PvP trading.\n\nFor example, let’s say our burn curve were a 70% scale replica of our mint curve. With this setup, we could see a maximum 30% drop in a token’s price from peak before our supply controls kicked in to help dampen us from free fall. The market would be free to trade up, down or sideways anywhere within this 30% gap. But if price breaches either bound, players would trade with the shopkeep to shift the window once more.\n\nFor a linear bonding curve with this gap, the actual reserve ratio would be 35% (`RR_actual = RR_max * BurnMintRatio = 0.50 * 0.70 = 0.35`), meaning the treasury must maintain 35% of the token’s current market capitalization as a reserve requirement. This is only one example, of course, and both the shape of the curve and the gap between the mint and burn curves can be adjusted to fit a protocol’s needs.\n\n# IRL\n\n### Project Funding through the CTM\n\n*the meme factory has run out of steam, this section is meant for founders*\n\nIt’s worth reiterating this reserve isn’t necessarily bankrolled by founders, VCs, or any one party in particular. It’s built up from all our minters’ contributions, with the area under the burn curve allocated to the reserve and the area above available for discretionary funding. As a result, the scalar gap between the mint and burn curves, and not the shape of the curve, determines what proportion of the invested funds are available to our founders for discretionary spending. If our burn curve is a 0.6x replica of our mint curve, for example, our founders receive 40% of invested funds to manifest their dreams into reality. This holds true whether the curve is constant, linear, sublinear or clinically insane.\n\nAdditionally, founders get to mint their own tokens at discounted rates. As the area above the burn curve is unallocated and available as discretionary funding, founders effectively mint at the burn price, which is always at a discount to the market rate as the burn curve serves as our price floor. A neat consequence of the windowed setup.\n\nSo that’s cool and all, but what about the area under the burn curve?\n\nYes we still have the reserve requirement, the integral of the burn curve at the current supply. Unfortunately, we’re unable to manifest new tokens out of thin air using the model described so far. This is a strict requirement, a hard cash-money requirement for minting tokens even for our founders. Despite getting the best rate as the first to mint, and even a discounted rate in perpetuity, most founders would consider the early capital requirement a deal breaker, a fatal flaw in the model. I’m inclined to agree.\n\nThe reserve ratio isn’t negligible, after all. And founders need an initial balance of tokens to incentivize their community and align their teams’ to the success of the protocol.\n\nI can speak to potential solutions in more rigorous writings to come (dubious). For now, though, let’s just say there are workarounds. Free minting during contract publication and postponed reserve requirements come to mind. Given this model will ultimately result in founders having access to smaller portions of their “fully diluted” token supply upon founding, it’s important we don’t increase the capital burden for founders looking to launch protocols with tokens stabilized by shopkeep.\n\n### Sublinear Curves in Practice\n\n*skip this unless you’re math-pilled and solidity-literate*\n\nOne might ask, why monomial curves? In short, they’re easy to integrate and easy-ish to approximate for implementation. Just look at on-chain approximations for [sigmoids](https://easonchaijw.medium.com/an-actual-sigmoid-function-in-solidity-6b78d002d8be) and [logarithms](https://medium.com/coinmonks/math-in-solidity-part-5-exponent-and-logarithm-9aef8515136e) by comparison. My math may be a bit rusty, but approximating and implementing their integrals on-chain seems less than ideal. By comparison, the [Babylonian Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method) is elegant and already employed to approximate square roots semi-efficiently on-chain ([sqrtLibrary.sol](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x396dd1f7E3c8044784937935F834C3F8d58EB497#code)). [My take on this](https://github.com/jubrlee/stable-supply/blob/master/packages/hardhat/contracts/libraries/FuzzyMath.sol) employs an [extension to the Babylonian Method](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237415858_EXTENDING_THE_BABYLONIAN_ALGORITHM), which generalizes the property of quadratic convergence to arbitrary n-roots.\n\nMonomials are also easy. Much easier to communicate to an audience. And their properties, such as point derivatives, are easy to reason about, so they’re easy to design around. The generalized equation for maximum reserve ratio, for example, is `1/(1+a)`.   Elegant innit?\n\nThis solution hasn’t been seen in the wild, largely (i assume) due to a lack of interest in innovating in this direction. Founders and investors aren’t aligned in the short term to opt for the Continuous Token Model as the preferred mode of funding. And for those that have considered it, it’s not entirely obvious that the sublinear curve is something we prefer, as evidenced by the dialogue around CTM bonding curves to date. And if it is obvious, the sublinear option is certainly more challenging to conjure an implementation for than its counterparts.\n\nSo without clear reasons for pursuing this solution, I can’t imagine anyone would venture down this path less traveled. Some of you may have noticed the obscurity of the paper referenced. With 6 citations in its 23 years of life, it ain’t exactly pop. And it certainly wasn’t the first option explored. The path to its discovery was a winding and painful one, littered with dead ends and disappointments.\n\nBut this solution has promise. As many of you are probably aware, there are no generalized, low-level abstractions to represent floating points in Solidity. As a result, calculating a fractional exponent proves impossible. Bad news for anyone attempting to map sublinear monomials. That was our motivation for applying the Babylonian Method for square-root approximation for quadratic voting. Now, imagine if we had a tool to efficiently approximate arbitrary n-roots, not just square-roots. Well, we could use that primitive.\n\nBy representing our sublinear monomial as a fractional exponent `x^(m/n)` it simply becomes the n-root of `x^m` where `m` and `n` are both positive whole numbers. As each loop in this approximation is fairly expensive (\\~30 Gas), it’s important to tighten the initial estimate to minimize the number of loops before convergence. We can do this by bounding the subtotal `x^m` by a power of 2 with some bit shifting (brute-forced atm but can be cleaned up using a binary search). Bounded tightly, the loop converges to the nearest whole number within 10 iterations for all cases covered in [testing](https://github.com/jubrlee/stable-supply/blob/master/packages/hardhat/test/FuzzyMathTest.js).\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine uses for these approximations on-chain. One critical use case that comes to mind is sublinear stake-to-vote-weight mapping. Sublinear mappings in voting, paired with sybil resistant practices (outside the scope of this article) are a prerequisite to shifting away from the purely plutocratic voting systems we employ today.\n\nIf even for that sole reason, I’m eager to see this implementation fleshed out to a higher standard. As is, this implementation would be sufficient for the CTM bonding curves described in this article, perhaps even on Ethereum mainnet for high-enough mint/burn balances. Further gas optimizations would enable higher-frequency use cases such as vote-mapping, at least on L2s and PoS systems.\n\nThere are currently limitations on the inputs allowed in order to avoid overflows: loosely `m*n*log2(x) < 256`. We can optimize this for real world use cases by focusing on the number of significant figures, rather than rounding to the nearest whole number. I’m also not the expert on gas optimizations, but I have uploaded a first-pass implementation of the Continuous Token Model [here](https://github.com/jubrlee/stable-supply/tree/master/packages/hardhat/contracts) as an extension to the ERC20. I’ll be finishing the tests and cleaning up the code in coming weeks to have it available open source.\n\nHaving only slung(?) Solidity for a couple months now, I have a lot of catching up to do on the industry. And I’d like to take this as an opportunity to announce my existence. To attract collaborators much more capable than myself. And to identify some mentors willing to field some inevitably obvious-in-hindsight questions. Hopefully, some of you see the same value in sublinear mappings as I do. And hopefully, this CTM use-case is one compelling enough to to be adopted as a building block.\n\nAgain, my DMs are open. Let’s talk tokenomics :^)\n\n# in nuce (🔩 , 🥜)\n\n1. the continuous token model enables **better alignment between investors**\n2. reserve funds can enable supply controls to **dampen price volatility**\n3. a sliding price window soft-pegs tokens while allowing for **full scalability**\n4. sublinear monomial curve works best and is already **cheap enough for an L2**\n5. available 🔜™️ at a repo near you    ( [notion](https://jubrilee.notion.site/To-Rug-or-Not-to-Rug-Why-is-that-a-Question-2eb29017d861445e86e0c515329a5669) for easier reading / discussion )\n\n# Notes\n\n1. source: my TL\n2. iykyk\n3. $FRAX price is defined according to multiple chainlink oracles tracking exchange rates for FRAX in DEx pools. $DAI price is defined according to ______\n4.

They’re both formulations used to describe the relationship between price and supply of assets. I’ll continue referring to them simply as “Bonding Curves”, though, for the sake of brevity; just know that I refer specifically to the monomial bonding curves explored in the 2017 era.\n7.

From staying on top of the latest news to getting entertained to keeping in touch with friends and family, social apps play a vital role in our lives.\n\nBut, there have been very few social apps that have taken off and sustained in contrast to the thousands of attempts worldwide. From the popular YouTuber, Casey Neistat’s [Beme](https://medium.com/hackernoon/bemes-history-85f3719c7ed0), David Dobrik’s [Dispo](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattklein/2021/02/17/is-dispo-david-dobriks-new-app-and-the-past-our-tech-future/?sh=7855ecac2437), ex-President of the US, Donald Trump’s [Truth Social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social) to the nerdy kids in college dorms — many have tried and still have been trying to build social apps through the years.\n\nI have personally spent the past year building and learning about social apps. And, they are some of the toughest products to build and scale. Infact, building a successful social network is an extremely rare event. It takes tremendous amounts of effort to get them off the ground and it’s an unforgiving grind for the founders trying to build one.\n\nThough building successful social networks is a tough nut to crack, there are a few common themes in all the successful ones. So below, I’ve tried to condense all my learnings to highlight the 5 fundamental factors to building a successful social app.\n\n### 1. Product\n\nFinding the right format and the right set of dedicated tools is a crucial first step for social products. For example, there were many photo-sharing apps that came before Instagram. But, Instagram banked on one core insight at that point: The founders of Instagram saw that an app called Hipstamatic - which basically let users add filters to their photos was rising to the top. The founders noticed that this app grew in popularity even though it was a paid service and saw that people were sharing these photos on other networks like Facebook and Twitter. So they built Instagram and allowed users to add free filters and also share photos on Instagram’s network. And in 2010, it was fairly difficult to get photos off your phone and share to other places, so Instagram made it easy for people to easily share their photos on Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr. A cherry on the top was a comparatively [faster speed of uploading photos](https://www.cultofmac.com/164285/the-clever-trick-instagram-uses-to-upload-photos-so-quickly/) than other apps and a clean grid layout to display all the photos. All these little elements contributed to the initial momentum of Instagram and the rest is, ofcourse, history!\n\nIn many ways, building a social network is like building a new country/economy. Imagine you discovered a new land. Now you want to build an economy, get people to migrate to your country, and grow the population. To do this, you need to first provide people with a compelling reason to make them leave their already established life in a country and move to an entirely new country. It can be achieved through one of these 2 ways:\n\n1. Sell “the American dream” to the people in other countries (content creators on other networks realize that a random person went on to become super-famous through Tiktok. So they think “Maybe I can do the same?”)\n2. Provide an exclusive experience/service that isn’t available anywhere else (disappearing photos on Snapchat, free filters in the early days of Instagram, a directory of all the students from a college in the early days of Facebook, exclusive conversations on Clubhouse in its early days)\n\nIn a social app context, why should I ever leave Snapchat or why should a Youtube creator ever leave the platform to move to your new app? These apps get the job done and moving the entire social graph is highly unlikely.\n\nJust as we’ve seen in the case of Instagram, having a great product hook with a unique social graph and a clear and obvious utility is crucial for social products. Also, almost all social apps start out looking like fun toys in the beginning — there are no complex algorithms, moderation, or plenty of product features either. They're simple, yet powerful tools that allow creative expression.\n\n### 2. Timing\n\nGetting the timing right is quite important for social apps. Coming back to the example of Instagram: teenagers always look for ways to look cool and to differentiate themselves from their parents. As Facebook got more popular, there was widespread parental supervision on the platform. Soon enough, using Facebook had become an embarrassing signal for teens and they naturally hopped on to the cool new hip hangout in the town - Instagram.\n\nTalking about a recent example, the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns played a really important role in the rise of Clubhouse in its early days. It definitely wouldn’t have been possible for Clubhouse to get to the top had it launched just a year back in 2019.\n\n### 3. Atomic Network\n\nFor social apps, it’s all about the people on the app. Unlike other products that inherently possess utility, social apps are default dead on arrival and only become useful when there are others using the app. So, when building a social network, it’s important to achieve a critical mass of connected users in the beginning. Essentially, create a small, stable, engaged network that can self-sustain—an atomic network—then likely you can build a second network adjacent to the first one. This could be a single city, college campus, or small beta test at an individual company.\n\nFor example, Mark Zuckerberg first built Facebook only for Harvard students and then expanded to other campuses and then opened it up to the world. Snapchat famously grew within the high school segment. Discord was specifically for the gamers community in the initial days. Had Discord started with an undesirable set of users, it likely would not have become what it is today. So essentially, social apps start out in a vertical community, establish a strong network and expand then on from there. [Andrew Chen](https://twitter.com/andrewchen) (a16z) has excellently written about this topic in his book - [The Cold Start Problem](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Start-Problem-Andrew-Chen-ebook/dp/B08HZ5XY7X).\n\n### 4. Vibe\n\nThis is more of an art than science. Essentially, vibe for me in a social app context is how people perceive your app and how they feel using it. It’s the sum of a lot of small details IMO: the name, the design, the product positioning, people on the app, and content on the app among others. It might sound not so important on the surface, but it is a trivial component of all successful social apps.\n\nTeens perceive Snapchat as a private, fun, social communications app because of its intimacy-centric design & quirky branding. Another example is that even though [Vine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_(service)) was a short video app like TikTok, it was positioned as a “microblogging website” and focussed on attracting existing creators and never gave rise to as many creators as TikTok did from the early days. But, TikTok positioned itself as a short video karaoke app for lip-syncing and dancing and gave rise to a whole new set of creators from the early days. Though there were a lot of other reasons for the downfall of Vine, positioning was one of the important ones.\n\n### 5. Keeping up\n\nIf you get all of the above right, which is a huge milestone by itself, your app would likely be the talk of the town. The app would always be buzzing, users flock to try out your new thing, servers crash, press reporters call you the next big thing, investors want to be on your cap-table, and there would be a steep increase in spam. While one may only need a small insight and just a couple of people to build the product in the initial days, it takes a tremendous amount of effort after hitting a certain mass of users to scale a network—to counteract market saturation, playing defense against spam and to amplify network effects over time. Even if you’ve got the right product at the right time, if you’re not able to actively keep up the key metrics like the number of sessions per user & retention, the product will likely die and join the graveyard of social apps that couldn’t make it like [MySpace](https://productmint.com/what-happened-to-myspace/#:\\~:text=Myspace%20failed%20because%20of%20rising,2005%20but%20eventually%20flamed%20out.), [Path](https://tech.co/news/path-failure-daum-kakao-2015-05#:\\~:text=Founded%20back%20in%202010%20by,its%20five%20years%20of%20operation.), [Yik Yak](https://productmint.com/what-happened-to-yik-yak/#:\\~:text=Executive%20Summary%3A,having%20a%20sustainable%20business%20model.), [Friendster](https://productmint.com/what-happened-to-friendster/#:\\~:text=Friendster%20failed%20because%20of%20site,network%20for%20a%20short%20time.), and others.\n\nIn this phase of the product, it becomes more important than ever to stay close to the users and make data-informed decisions. A great example of this is the introduction of the Instagram Stories feature. According to the founders, Instagram had gotten worse at the job it was originally hired for by its users—allowing people to really quickly show their friends what they're upto—as people were no longer posting as much as they did in the initial days of the app. And Stories was the evolution they had to make in order to recapture the job people originally hired Instagram for.\n\n### Web3 social apps\n\nThere are a lot of developers trying to build a web3 social network in recent days. As stated above, social apps are generally extremely hard to build. Web3 versions of Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube won’t make any difference to the end-user if there’s no strong value proposition other than being decentralized, and permissionless. The value of these giant social networks lies in their content library and the social graph and trying to replace them requires more than just decentralization. Rather, a verticalized web3 social app serving a specific niche (e.g. [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) for crypto-curious folks) or a fresh, new social app built on web3 with a completely new content format and social dynamics might work.\n\nAgain, social apps are hard enough to get off the ground and requiring users to setup a wallet to use the app and making them approve wallet transactions for repeating actions (e.g. confirming a transaction just to like a post) will further reduce the already low probability of success. It can only be made possible if the decentralization & interoperability of the on-chain record is coupled with the seamless experience of off-chain systems.\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nI've just scratched the surface of what constitutes a successful social app. There are a lot of other things that come into consideration when building a social network. But having said all this, most social apps are born unintentionally and out of accidents.\n\nBy and large, innovative products aren’t strategically imagined ahead of time – they’re stumbled upon while experimenting on the go. Instagram was a pivot from Burbn, Twitter spun out of Odeo, Facebook was originally Facemash, BuzzFeed evolved from one of many “for fun” experiments — the list goes on and on. Tomorrow, a high school kid can strike the right idea, break all the rules and still go on to rise to the top with their new creation as a result of luck or timing. Such is the space!\n\nIf you are building in the space or thinking about the future of web3 social, I’d love to chat.

According to the founders, Instagram had gotten worse at the job it was originally hired for by its users—allowing people to really quickly show their friends what they're upto—as people were no longer posting as much as they did in the initial days of the app. And Stories was the evolution they had to make in order to recapture the job people originally hired Instagram for.\n\n### Web3 social apps\n\nThere are a lot of developers trying to build a web3 social network in recent days. As stated above, social apps are generally extremely hard to build. Web3 versions of Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube won’t make any difference to the end-user if there’s no strong value proposition other than being decentralized, and permissionless. The value of these giant social networks lies in their content library and the social graph and trying to replace them requires more than just decentralization. Rather, a verticalized web3 social app serving a specific niche (e.g. [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) for crypto-curious folks) or a fresh, new social app built on web3 with a completely new content format and social dynamics might work.\n\nAgain, social apps are hard enough to get off the ground and requiring users to setup a wallet to use the app and making them approve wallet transactions for repeating actions (e.g. confirming a transaction just to like a post) will further reduce the already low probability of success. It can only be made possible if the decentralization & interoperability of the on-chain record is coupled with the seamless experience of off-chain systems.\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nI've just scratched the surface of what constitutes a successful social app. There are a lot of other things that come into consideration when building a social network. But having said all this, most social apps are born unintentionally and out of accidents.\n\nBy and large, innovative products aren’t strategically imagined ahead of time – they’re stumbled upon while experimenting on the go. Instagram was a pivot from Burbn, Twitter spun out of Odeo, Facebook was originally Facemash, BuzzFeed evolved from one of many “for fun” experiments — the list goes on and on. Tomorrow, a high school kid can strike the right idea, break all the rules and still go on to rise to the top with their new creation as a result of luck or timing. Such is the space!\n\nIf you are building in the space or thinking about the future of web3 social, I’d love to chat. [My DMs](https://twitter.com/thrnxr) are open.\n\nThanks for reading, have fun!\n\n[Tharun](https://twitter.com/thrnxr)", "timestamp": 1656102861, "digest": "lnZ5DT1BGLtsnMas6d3U84nceWc5MB8Xa_kbmEq89nA", "contributor": "0x79180828a8259B12F507Ca30737997973E9001c2"}

Apesar de o número de carteiras ativas ter diminuído 4% em relação ao maio, 350.000 ainda é um número relevante para o inverno cripto.\n\nUm feito relevante da Splinterlands foi a venda bem-sucedida das [licenças dos nós validadores SPS](https://peakd.com/hive-13323/@splinterlands/splintershards-sps-validator-node-overview-and-license-presale). Em 26 de maio, 2.000 foram vendidas em menos de 15 minutos, queimando 14.5M de SPS e alocando mais de U$4M para o tesouro da Splinterlands DAO. As licenças dos nós serão uma peça fundamental para a próxima fase do *game,* que migrará para um sistema DPoS - *Delegated Proof of Stake -,* implementada para aumentar a performance das transações do jogo e descentralizá-lo ainda mais.\n\nCom este novo modelo, os *holders* de SPS poderão votar na governança da Splinterlands DAO e contribuir com propostas e decisões para melhorar seu ecossistema, além de poderem delegar seus tokens a validadores da rede para assegurá-la e receber recompensas.\n\n## U$72M foram gastos em lands no Illuvium - e é só o começo\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5-k3a62v85uHHMjkgrTZ7.png?height=420&width=810)\n\nIlluvium é um dos *games* mais esperados da indústria GameFi. Considerado um dos primeiros jogos AAA, com [investidores](https://docs.illuvium.io/whitepaper/partners/) como Delphi Digital, Yield Guild Games e Stani Kulechov - CEO da Aave -, atraiu atenção da comunidade pela beleza dos gráficos apresentados e da profundidade da narrativa em seu mundo virtual.\n\nUma das peças-chave para ingressar no Illuvium são as *lands,* terrenos que permitirão seus donos ter acesso ao principal insumo do jogo, o combustível. No começo do mês de junho, o leilão das *lands* realizada [possibilitou a Illuvium arrecadar U$72M](https://twitter.com/illuviumio/status/1533458697514536960), mostrando o interesse da comunidade mesmo com o mercado em queda.\n\nSua escolha de adotar a Immutable X, uma Layer 2 da Ethereum, para desenvolver seu ecossistema somada ao uso do Leilão Holandês para ofertar seus NFTs, proporcionou uma experiência fluída e com taxas para *mint* de U$20. O uso de segundas camadas e/ou chains específicas - como as *subnets* da Avalanche - para desenvolvimentos de *games play to earn* pode ser uma tendência para projetos GameFi.\n\n## Gala Games: Onboarding de players web2 via colaborações\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WWxlLDMPC3CFN1N1TWhBO.png?height=720&width=1920)\n\nA Gala Games é uma gigante no setor dos cripto-games.

GRIT, um *game* de *battle-royale* no faroeste criado pela empresa, será disponibilizado na Epic Games Store, introduzindo mais de 30M de usuários ativos diariamente na plataforma a um jogo *play to earn.*\n\nOutros jogos da Gala Games também estão em constante evolução, graças a série de parcerias com marcas de renome do mercado. Project Saturn, um jogo de ficção científica produzido pela empresa, irá replicar o universo do Battlestar Galactica, misturando componentes da web3 em seu mundo virtual. Walking Dead: Empires, também introduzirá os jogadores numa narrativa semelhante a vivenciada pelos aficionados pela famosa série de TV. Ambas produções só foram possíveis devido a acordos de direitos de propriedade intelectual realizados com a Universal e AMC.\n\nAlém disso, a Gala Games também une-se a estúdios com produções de sucesso na web2, para aplicar essa genialidade a *games play to earn.* A Fun Dogs, responsável pelo The Witcher 3, está contribuindo para o desenvolvimento do Forever Winter, FPS de terror presente no ecossistema da Gala.\n\nReunindo parcerias de sucesso, gradualmente a empresa constrói seu universo de *games* para públicos específicos, na meta de um dia todos comporem o Galaverse.\n\nVocê pode ler a pesquisa completa da DappRadar [aqui.](https://dappradar.com/blog/dappradar-crypto-games-report-5-blockchain-games-continue-to-defy-the-bear-market)\n\n## Dica de Ouro: Nunca Pare de Estudar\n\nSplinterlands, Illuvium e Gala Games são ecossistemas para ficar de olho, mas não se prenda a determinados *games* ou nichos mercadológicos. O importante é entender a receita do sucesso dos diversos projetos espalhados pelo universo cripto e compreende-la.

{"id": "b6hrsNAMo5mxQ1wwqLqJW-g1nVTqSjyPWnBRDjBnfBw", "title": "Projeto Millennium: Capítulo 1 - Medo", "body": "*Rio de janeiro, Brasil*\n\n*6 meses antes do Marco Zero*\n\nDentre todas as coisas que se deve ou não fazer, qualquer morador do Rio de Janeiro saberia que andar tarde da noite no Centro da cidade não era uma boa ideia. Adentrar em uma rua escura e pouco visitada seria algo ainda menos prudente. Ulisses andava tão distraído ultimamente que nem cogitou a imprudência de entrar àquele horário na rua que costumava usar tantas vezes como atalho para não chegar atrasado no trabalho. Talvez também não tivesse sido uma boa ideia estender tanto o happy hour com Daniel, mesmo sabendo que o dia seguinte ainda seria um dia de trabalho.\n\nTudo estava muito escuro, quase nenhuma iluminação; a movimentação de pessoas ali era zero e não se conseguia ouvir praticamente ruído nenhum. Uma água escoando de algum encanamento aberto, o barulho do vento arrastando alguns papéis mais à frente e mais nada além disso. Nem parecia que em uma rua próxima ainda houvesse um certo movimento de carros e pessoas. Na verdade, o silêncio naquele lugar ultrapassava o natural. Ulisses não era alguém que se deixava levar por coisas tais como o medo do escuro, mas um arrepio frio começou a lhe passar pela nuca.\n\n*\"Deus me livre de ter algum bandido nesse lugar! Eu nem teria a quem pedir ajuda!\"* – pensava.\n\nEngraçado como mesmo um ateu em momentos como esses, às vezes pensa em alguma frase contendo a palavra “Deus”. Isso talvez porque instintivamente Ulisses soubesse que o tal medo que sentia estava longe do medo de ser assaltado. Era algo mais profundo, talvez mais sobrenatural do que isso. Desde alguns passos mais atrás, sentia a estranha sensação de estar sendo vigiado. Poderia até mesmo jurar que sentiu, por um breve momento, alguém respirar em sua nuca e sussurrar algo inaudível ao pé do seu ouvido.\n\n*\"Ulisses, seu idiota, não tem ninguém aqui!\"* – dizia para si mesmo, desejando não ter assistido a maratona de filmes da Sexta-feira 13 com seu amigo Daniel naquela semana.\n\nOuviu passos atrás de si e virou-se automaticamente, com o coração quase saltando do peito. Porém, nada. Somente a rua vazia e o barulho do vento, que parecia um pouco mais frio agora. Ao olhar para a escuridão atrás de si, sentia como se “algo” o estivesse encarando de volta. Poderia jurar que percebeu um leve movimento no meio da escuridão. Naquele momento, Ulisses começou a sentir a necessidade de apertar um pouco mais o passo, e assim o fez. Já estava quase correndo, na verdade. O caminho parecia mais longo que o normal. Teria entrado na rua errada? Virou uma rua, duas ruas. Esquerda, direita, direita novamente... agora estava em algum lugar que não se lembrava de ter visto antes. Ele estava se dando conta que à noite todas as pequenas ruas do Centro do Rio pareciam iguais.\n\nFoi ao virar a última rua que notou a presença dele. Sentado na calçada um pouco mais à sua frente, com as costas apoiadas em um *container* cheio de lixo, estava um homem. Sua aparência contrastava com o ambiente, usando roupas finas, um terno preto com uma camisa branca por baixo e um sapato bem lustrado. Sua pele era tão branca que quase se confundia com a cor da camisa. O que lhe dava um ar peculiar era um chapéu-coco, parecido com o que usava Chaplin em seus filmes do cinema mudo. Sentava-se apoiado no lixo, com seu braço direito sobre o seu joelho, como se estivesse sentado no gramado de um parque, apreciando a bela vista. Olhava fixo para o chão, enquanto dava uma forte tragada em um cigarro, sem nem mesmo parecer perceber a presença de Ulisses.\n\nAo ver aquele homem estranho, a vontade de Ulisses era dar a meia volta e tentar outro caminho, porém tinha a certeza que seguindo direto naquela rua iria dar próximo à sua casa. Mesmo tendo algo no profundo de sua mente lhe dizendo fortemente para não passar por ali, decidiu por achar que era um medo irracional e acabou seguindo em frente. Chegando mais próximo ao *container* onde o homem estava apoiado, começou a sentir um forte cheiro, como o cheiro de carne apodrecida. Tão forte que chegava a enjoar. Reparou que ao lado do container jazia um cachorro morto, com a barriga aberta, como se houvesse sido atropelado. Na verdade, pelo estado do corpo e pela quantidade de bichos, parecia já estar ali por alguns dias. Não conseguia entender como aquele homem aguentava ficar sentado ali com um cheiro tão forte assim. Colocando a mão sobre o nariz, passou, ainda sem ver reação alguma nele. Na verdade, ele preferia que aquele homem continuasse como estava.\n\n– Perdido, rapaz?\n\nUlisses deu um salto para o lado. Quase gritou. Do jeito que já estava apreensivo com a situação, ouvir a voz daquele homem do nada foi quase como algo do além. Era uma voz suave e um pouco grave, chegando a ser um pouco sinistra. Sua aparência era sombria, mas ainda não conseguia lhe discernir o rosto direito, por causa da escuridão.\n\n– S-sei muito bem para onde estou indo, obrigado! – sua voz estava meio rouca pelo susto.\n\n– Pois não parece – disse o homem dando um leve sorriso. – Tome cuidado, esses becos não são lá muito seguros a essas horas.\n\nRepentinamente, alguma coisa se mexeu dentro do *container* de lixo, o que fez Ulisses dar um passo atrás. Viu algumas sacolas de pano com manchas escuras e úmidas. Aquilo não lhe deixou uma boa impressão.\n\n– Aqui é muito mais perigoso para você do que para mim – disse Ulisses com um tom altivo, se referindo aos trajes do homem. – Você é louco de andar por aqui vestido desse jeito. Vai atrair os assaltantes!\n\n– Venho buscar algo muito precioso para mim. Vale a pena o risco – e desdenhou, sorrindo mais uma vez com o canto da boca, enquanto levantava o cigarro para mais uma tragada.\n\nMais um movimento no *container* fez o coração de Ulisses disparar. Seria um gato ou o quê? Meio assustado e um pouco desconfiado com a última sentença daquele homem, preferiu seguir sem falar mais nada. Continuou andando sem dar mais atenção a ele. Pouco antes de passar pela esquina mais próxima, arriscou um último olhar para trás. O homem continuava apoiado no *container* de lixo, olhando fixamente para um relógio de bolso dourado. *\"Só pode ser maluco! Um maluco cheio da grana, mas mesmo assim, maluco\"*.\n\nFicou tão absorto pensando no que acabara de lhe acontecer, que demorou a perceber que estava sendo seguido, desde que passou pela última esquina. Depois de andar mais um pouco, ouviu o barulho de passos e olhou para trás, vendo um homem de jaqueta marrom seguindo-o a poucos metros. Apertou o passo, o que fez seu perseguidor começar a seguir seu ritmo. Já percebendo o possível assalto, começou a correr, e notou que seu perseguidor começava a correr junto. Ouviu um estouro que parecia um tiro e se jogou ao chão. Rapidamente o sujeito de jaqueta o alcançou. Agora sim ele estava ferrado. O homem apontava um revólver direto para o seu peito e, com a voz muito alterada, gritava:\n\n– *Perdeu*, irmão! Passa tudo que tiver no bolso! Não vai ficar um centavo!!!\n\n– Cara, calma, por favor! Só tenho um celular e alguns trocados, nem deu *pra* pegar o ônibus! – Ulisses respondeu, ainda caído sentado no chão.\n\n– Se não tiver pelo menos *vintão*, vai morrer, maluco! Passa tudo! – seus olhos estavam vermelhos (certamente drogado) e, pela expressão, parecia decidido a realmente puxar o gatilho.\n\n– Peraí cara, eu vou te passar tudo! – e colocou a mão no bolso de trás em um movimento desesperado e brusco, sem perceber o seu grande erro. Se houvesse um manual de como não agir em um assalto, fazer um movimento como esse estaria entre os primeiros tópicos.\n\nO homem puxou o gatilho quase imediatamente. Seguiram-se um clarão e um estampido alto. Ulisses olhou para baixo e viu o que ele mais temia: sangue. Pelo visto tudo aconteceu tão rápido que ele nem chegou a sentir a dor do tiro. O sangue manchava sua camisa e ele o sentia escorrer pelo rosto. Atônito e esperando ainda sentir a dor do tiro, ouviu seu algoz gritando desesperadamente. Foi quando percebeu que o sangue não era seu. Olhou para o lado e viu a arma caída no chão, enquanto o homem apertava com força seu braço sem mão. Seria possível ela ter explodido?\n\n– *Joca Sapateiro!* Você cometeu o maior erro da sua vida! – disse uma voz vinda das sombras logo atrás deles.\n\nEle já tinha ouvido aquela voz um pouco antes. Quando olhou para trás do sujeito de jaqueta, viu o homem de chapéu-coco sair das sombras, andando em sua direção. \"O que esse cara fez? Como?\" – os pensamentos de Ulisses estavam confusos. Não havia em sua mente uma explicação clara para o ocorrido.\n\n– V-você!? – disse o assaltante, num tom desesperado. – Mas eu não fiz nada! Juro que não ia matar ninguém!\n\nO homem do chapéu-coco aproximou-se calmamente do suposto Joca e, dando uma tragada no cigarro e jogou a fumaça direto seu rosto. Abriu um largo e irritado sorriso enquanto olhava para a aparência assustada do rapaz. Ulisses estava ainda paralisado olhando para a cena.\n\n– De todas as maneiras de autodestruição do ser humano, essa é uma das que mais gosto – disse o homem, segurando o cigarro em sua mão esquerda. – Suave, silencioso, relaxa e o ajuda a pensar melhor, enquanto corrói lentamente seus pulmões ao passar dos anos. Bem diferente, eu diria, de determinados vícios que corroem a sua mente e capacidade cognitiva, fazendo-o tão indiferente aos perigos contra sua própria vida – e apagou o cigarro numa mancha de sangue que estava no ombro da jaqueta de Joca.\n\n– P-perdoe-me – disse Joca, se contraindo de dor – Não consigo entender o que você quer dizer...\n\n– Quero dizer que o seu vício em cola subiu à sua cabeça, seu estúpido! – o homem de chapéu-coco parecia irado. – Ainda que eu tenha dito para ficar em casa hoje, você insistiu em sair? Mesmo depois de todas as chances que lhe dei, ainda insiste em desafiar minhas ordens!? A mera tentativa de ferir meus protegidos é imperdoável!\n\n*\"Protegido?\"* – Ulisses estava ainda mais confuso. O que aquele louco estava dizendo? Tinha acabado de vê-lo pela primeira vez no beco! Pelo menos era isso que ele imaginava.\n\n– P-protegido? E-e-eu não sabia! M-me perdoe, por f-favor!! – ciente de que havia cometido um grave erro, estava claramente desesperado.\n\n– Você sabe muito bem como as coisas funcionam – disse, aparentando estar mais calmo. Começou a estalar ruidosamente as juntas dos dedos das mãos. – Já não há mais espaço para perdão e eu serei obrigado a pegar aquilo que é meu por direito. TËQEL!!\n\nGritando aquela palavra estranha, o homem de chapéu-coco, estalou os dedos com força. Ouviu-se outro estampido forte seguido de um clarão, e Joca desabou no chão, gritando. Seu joelho esquerdo (ou o que havia restado dele) estava ensanguentado e Ulisses pôde ver, por baixo da calça agora rasgada pelo impacto, um certo desenho brilhando em vermelho vivo na sua perna. Sem entender direito o que acontecia, desesperou-se ao ver a cena e levantou-se, correndo o máximo que pôde, enquanto ouvia outros estalos altos atrás de si, seguidos de urros terríveis.\n\n*\"O que está acontecendo aqui!?\"* – ele corria, ainda tentando entender o que havia acabado de ver. Parecia estar dentro de um dos filmes de da Sexta-feira 13.\n\nConforme imaginava, seguir a rua até o fim acabou por levá-lo para a avenida, que ainda estava um pouco movimentada. Continuou correndo até quase não aguentar e parou, ofegante, apoiado em uma parede. Já estava longe o suficiente. As pessoas passavam direto e nem lhe davam atenção, sem nem mesmo reparar que estava todo sujo de sangue. Sentou-se, em choque, tentando organizar seus pensamentos.\n\nQuando estava ponderando se o que acabara de ver tinha ou não sido real, ouviu o grito de uma mulher. Olhando ao seu redor, viu um pouco mais à frente a tal mulher, olhando para cima e ainda gritando desesperada. Algumas pessoas que passavam começaram a se aglomerar em volta de um poste e também olhavam para cima, com uma expressão horrorizada. Ulisses não conseguiu ver direito, mas havia algo pendurado no poste.\n\nQuando chegou próximo, viu uma massa avermelhada, que reconheceu, pela jaqueta, que aquilo já havia sido um ser humano conhecido como Joca Sapateiro. O rosto estava completamente desfigurado e faltavam-lhe membros. Desviando o olhar, viu na entrada de um beco, o homem de chapéu-coco olhando para ele, com um forte brilho vermelho nas pupilas dos olhos e um sorriso maléfico em seu rosto, desaparecendo na escuridão.", "timestamp": 1656104537, "digest": "J2Tqoey7uAxTzIUz1fDrsSw-KOSOy10j3afF5UUozvY", "contributor": "0x41e6Fa672C666CD5436D6286D71ABB645b8E40B4"}

{"id": "kNjU5gQb6VT3Ot2RwhFOAaw93btbxCXap8HZGBqYPMI", "title": "The \"crypto\" in cryptocurrency", "body": "The word “crypto” may spark images in your mind of ciphers, code breaking and even Bletchley park’s involvement in World War 2. I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). From his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. The idea that information wants to find its way into every nook and cranny does have consequences (for the better or worse). For example, information leaks can help us learn about atrocities committed by government, but it can also be used by the government for surveillance of its citizens. \n\nCryptography is a tool that enables us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. It has similarities to the perspective of David vs Goliath as cryptography is one of the only tools that allows a citizen to successfully fend against a nation state actor. In fact, for most of cryptography’s history, it is a tool that allows the defender to protect itself from an all-powerful adversary. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA protocol designed using cryptography tends to have three goals: \n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is not concerned with confidentiality. It is only focused on integrity and authentication. Both goals form the backbone for decentralization as it allows anyone to verify: \n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nPut another way, decentralization relies on a property called public verifiability. This property allows anyone to fetch data from an untrusted source and independently check if the relevant computation (and data) is correct. Applied to cryptocurrency, it allows a network of users to continuously check the blockchain’s integrity and ultimately protect our assets represented in the database. \n\nIf a user cannot get access to the data, or if the cryptography did not exist, then we must blindly trust an authority to protect the system -- essentially how the legacy financial system works today. \n\n## Twitter for your bank account\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\nNewcomers find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange. Very often, this is because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use on the dark web to buy drugs. The very name, -crypto-currency, can help lead to that misunderstanding. \n\nUnfortunately for criminals, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most traceable currencies in the world. It is a really bad tool for their desired purpose as the historical transactions are replicated across the world and kept forever. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose. \n\nIn fact, even for crime that originates on the network, there are some fun examples to consider:\n\n* **Bitfinex hacker**. The FBI helped recover [over 94k BTC](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency) from the hacker on behalf of Bitfinex. In typical crypto fashion, the hacker was an amateur rapper called [“Razzlekhan”](https://cointelegraph.com/news/comedic-rapper-charged-with-involvement-in-bitfinex-hack-out-on-bail) and a [sophisticated social engineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/agedlikemilk/comments/sskkj6/heather_morgan_giving_a_presentation_on_social/) attacker. They got caught after trying to cash out a small portion of the stolen bitcoins.  \n* **OpenSea insider trading.** A twitter user found credible evidence, using transactions in the blockchain, that a product manager at OpenSea were buying NFTs before they were announced on the homepage (and then sold for a premium). The [SEC will use this evidence](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-117) for proceedings against the ex-employee. \n* **MtGox repeatedly hacked.** The exchange was responsible for loosing around \\~6% of all Bitcoin. An investigation by WizSec, [using blockchain data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l70iRcSxqzo&ab_channel=TheBitcoinArmy), found credible evidence that the exchange was not solvent for a long time. \n\nWhile the lack of confidentiality has helped the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the eyes of regulators and law enforcement, confidentiality is still a sought-after feature to protect the right of users to transact. A number of cryptocurrency networks exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees for transferring assets including ZCash, Aztec Protocol and Monero. The new frontier of research and development is focused on building smart contract platforms that support confidentiality for some aspects of the application.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThere are only two primitives to consider and we have put together a dedicated article for each primitive alongside a brief explanation. \n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature. A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity. They can compute the credentials (public-private key pair) locally on their machine. The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer. A signature is timeless and it can be verified at any point in time. In fact, we can check all historical transactions in a network like Bitcoin and verify the signer was indeed authorised to spend the coins\n\n## What about zero knowledge proofs?\n\n![Amit Sahai explains the concept of a zero knowledge proof to various age groups ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MYRB6mfp7bTUCzCUFirfV.png?height=1568&width=2606)\n\nThe concept of a zero knowledge proof is very simple and this [video explanation by Amit Sahai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c&ab_channel=WIRED) remains one of the best explainers. \n\nBriefly, Alice (the prover) wants to convince Bob (a verifier) that a statement is true without telling them why it is true. Bob should only learnt 1 bit of information - the statement by Alice is indeed true. \n\nBut what is a statement? Let’s consider a few examples:\n\n**Financial transaction.** Alice wants to convince Bob that a financial transaction, `TX1`, is valid. If Bob is checking the validity of a transaction, he may want to check: \n\n* Does the sender have a sufficient balance to transfer the desired quantity of funds?\n* Did the sender digitally sign and authorise this transaction? \n\nThe tricky part is that Alice needs to convince Bob that `TX1` is valid without revealing the sender, receiver or the value transferred. She just wants to reveal a single bit of information - this transaction blob is indeed valid. \n\nIf this is possible, then we can build shielded and confidential transactions. Only the sender and receiver can read the content of a transaction, but the world can verify it is the transaction is valid and can be confirmed as final/irreversible. It may appear paradoxical, but it is indeed possible and [available for use on ZCash](https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-private-transactions/). \n\n**Accept an update to the database.** Alice wants to convince Bob about an `update` to the database. He should only apply this `update` if he is convinced the database is public.\n\nHe may:\n\n* Request from Alice the list of transactions that produced the database update.\n* Given his copy of the database, execute all transactions in order and compute `update’`. \n* Only apply it if `update === update’`\n\nThis may sound a bit far fetched. Why would Bob naively re-process every transaction to check if an update to the database is valid? Well, this is exactly what every node on the Ethereum network performs today and it is one of the scalability bottlenecks faced by the network. \n\nIn an ideal world, Alice can simply send Bob the `update` alongside a tiny `proof`. He can quickly check the proof, be convinced the update is valid, and then apply the update to his database. He only needs the update (“a state diff”) and he does not even need a copy of the transactions processed. \n\nAgain, this is possible and we can call it a computational integrity proof (as the zero knowledge property is not always required). It is within the realm of verifiable computing and it is implemented by [StarkWare’s layer-2 project](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-alpha-1-90c3348cca4f).  \n\n**How does a zero knowledge proof work exactly?** If you want to dive into the details, I recommend checking a host of online resource:\n\n* Stanford’s zero knowledge proof notes (hard)", "timestamp": 1656104827, "digest": "a4Y0TrLL7BcS8rarDfDVQW6HJKSTydm5K7u2sEqC2wA", "contributor": "0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5"}
