Crypto enthusiasts say their vision for the web would decentralize it, pushing it closer to its roots.\n\nWeb3 advocates emphasize user privacy and ownership of data.\n\nCentralization has helped onboard billions of people to the World Wide Web and created the stable, robust infrastructure on which it lives. At the same time, a handful of centralized entities have a stronghold on large swathes of the World Wide Web, unilaterally deciding what should and should not be allowed.\n\nWeb3 is the answer to this dilemma. Instead of a Web monopolized by large technology companies, Web3 embraces decentralization and is being built, operated, and owned by its users.

If someone wants to watch a movie, they can go to Netflix and watch a movie in a matter of seconds. If someone wants to hear their favorite song, all they have to do is have an Apple Music account and they can stream all of the music they want. If someone wants to send money to their friend, they can use Cashapp, or use a multitude of apps to send crypto in a near instant fashion. With the ability to do a multitude of things instantly, why can’t people be paid their salary or wages in the manner that they chose? With blockchain technology, payment streaming is becoming possible.\n\nPayment streaming allows employees to receive real-time wages. For example, if someone wants to be paid daily, they can receive the payment the same day after labor has been performed. Contrast that to today’s payment system. Employees have to work two weeks and then the following week, they are paid. Now, this system is what many employees in the United States are accustomed to so there hasn’t been any disruption. To go into further detail regarding how the system works, the employers owe the employees for their time. Theoretically, the employers are in debt to the employees but the debt carries no interest, is not mutual, and is one-sided in favor of the employers. ** \n **\n\nContrasting the traditional system to streaming payments, the latter is easier for entities sending payments as there only needs to be a series of set parameters embedded in a smart contract. To give context on how this could work, tokens can be sent from employers to employees on a continuous basis depending on the rate of payment flow. For example, if someone is to be paid 1000 dollars a month, they could receive payments of 1 dollar and 39 cents an hour or 23 cents per minute. This flexibility allows for people to be paid on their desired time horizon such as hourly, daily, or weekly. \n\nAdditionally, with the advent of crypto streaming, employers can pay their employees by paying them in the token of the receiver’s choice. Imagine if employers were able to invest in their employees by paying them in whatever tokens they please. Although, at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency industry has taken a massive hit, getting paid in certain crypto assets can be deemed as a way to encourage wealth building.\n\nAnother point about the benefits of payment streaming is the reduced reliability of financial institutions. Financial institutions charge many types of fees, exchange rates, commissions and other charges that inconvenience their account holders. Additionally, financial institutions can control when the received funds are available for an account holder’s use which is yet another inconvenience caused by the traditional financial system. \n\nInconveniences caused by not streaming payments pose real-world consequences for people. Many people suffer from not budgeting properly and sometimes “life happens”, which causes a need for instant availability of funds. Currently, people who are faced with a challenging system are forced to go into debt by using credit cards or by dealing with an undesirable situation. Imagine if someone had a car issue that prevented them from driving. If this person doesn’t have the necessary funds to get their car serviced, they will have to deal with the inconveniences of finding another means of traveling until they have access to more funds in the next pay period. However, if these individuals were able to stream their funds, they could pay to service their car once they accumulated enough money. \n\nCurrently, there are few projects looking to develop ways to drive the possibility of payment streaming. These projects include [Superfluid](https://twitter.com/superfluid_hq?s=21&t=TQ0hhKE3YVhqgYWodV8ytw), [Streamflow](https://twitter.com/streamflow_fi?s=21&t=TQ0hhKE3YVhqgYWodV8ytw), and [Roketo](https://twitter.com/roketostream?s=21&t=BmFd1mwTgP2PbnEkssusaw). While this article has focused on primarily payment streaming for wages, these vendors offer a wide variety of use cases leveraging the principles of streaming payments. \n\nSuperfluid is a startup founded in 2020 by [Francesco George Renzi](https://twitter.com/francescorenzia?s=21&t=dKh-A-ylpVemIi0IgKrrEQ), Miao Miao, and [Michele D’Aliessi](https://twitter.com/micheledaliessi?s=21&t=iUfVqmNKEWz9jvhFd6JadA). In July of 2021, the team scored an investment of 9 million dollars from firms including [Multicoin Capital](https://twitter.com/multicoincap?lang=en), [DeFinance Capital](https://twitter.com/defiancecapital?lang=en), [Delphi Ventures](https://twitter.com/delphi_digital?s=21&t=RlA3a4zRKneEclyUUyDPZQ), [Semantic Ventures](https://twitter.com/semanticvc). The round also included angel investors such as [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis?s=21&t=RlA3a4zRKneEclyUUyDPZQ), [Stani Kulechov](https://twitter.com/stanikulechov?s=21&t=RlA3a4zRKneEclyUUyDPZQ), [Ryan Selkis](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot), and [David Hoffman](https://twitter.com/trustlessstate?s=21&t=Tie5dI57iuQ7NR7Tl-z1Xg). The project has also received support from DAOs such as [Metacartel Ventures](https://twitter.com/venture_dao?s=21&t=bQzg6TxN1CjM5PYGMiFz3g), [The LAO](https://twitter.com/thelaoofficial), and [Alliance DAO](https://twitter.com/alliancedao?s=21&t=Bm0D9ECQAH4n1zJIz23Viw). Superfluid facilitates streams on the Ethereum blockchain through its smart contract framework that allows users to transfer tokens or other digital assets on chain with a set of predefined rules called agreements. Currently, the project’s capabilities include payment streaming with gas less transfers, with real-time liquidity which allows its users to only require enough balance to keep their payment streams open. Furthermore, users do not incur a delay when withdrawing their funds. \n\nStreamflow is a startup founded in 2021 whose team includes [@imprfekt](https://twitter.com/imprfekt?s=21&t=HKaDWqeT71m1QOpdwiAzRA) and others. The platform is built on Solana and its current capabilities include streaming payments and token vesting with more options coming in the future such as a multisig wallet. In the future, Streamflow aims to expand cross-chain and onboard web2 projects onto the platform. Streamflow’s most recent round of funding was a 3.1 million dollar seed round with backers that include [Jump Crypto](https://mobile.twitter.com/jumpcryptohq), [Solana Ventures](https://twitter.com/solanaventures?lang=en), [GBV Capital](https://twitter.com/gbvofficial?lang=en), [AngelDAO](https://twitter.com/angeldaoorg), [Huobi Ventures](https://twitter.com/huobiventures?lang=en) and others. \n\nRoketo is another payment streaming platform built on the [NEAR protocol](https://twitter.com/nearprotocol?s=21&t=fbOfQH-ItSYRNF5qCpw58A) whose primary contributors come from Kikimora Labs. The core team includes [Taras Dovgal](https://twitter.com/tarasdovgal?s=21&t=M1qUr1bj0nbhFOfasGFgOw), [Olga Isaeva](https://twitter.com/olyflow?s=21&t=uhmNY24CggKkW3dNGRZqwg), [Vasilisa Versus](https://twitter.com/dcversus?s=21&t=TtmvHOfggCCZbllIIAOFsA), and over 20 others. Roketo is backed by [MetaWeb Ventures](https://mobile.twitter.com/metawebvc), [A&T Capital](https://twitter.com/ant_capital?s=21&t=vVrsk_8dA4U-LLSX4Qn4tQ),[Cogitent Ventures](https://twitter.com/cogitentv?s=21&t=zC-QgTxzxYj9dwbA31ldLQ), and [Move Capital](https://twitter.com/movecap?s=21&t=bbOzlhC0d07uGAI3Jwpacw). The company’s current capabilities include payroll, vesting, and airdropping. Regarding payroll, Rocket serves its customers by providing a quick solution to setting up wages for employees with transparency and low cost. Roketo advertises its ability to the preceding functions while also ensuring its customers have total control over their crypto currency. With regards to vesting, Roketo’s vesting product aids founders with streaming tokens to their investors as well as their employees. Within Roketo’s product, users can set cliffs for token distribution and keep distribution consistent. Lastly, for Rocketo’s airdrop offering, Roketo touts itself as the most affordable and intuitive product on the market. \n\nWith the aforementioned startups and most likely others who are focused on creating products to help users stream funds, one can imagine that there are implications of the success of this innovation. Payment streaming will provide more flexibility and create more control for people to have over their finances. This control can provide a way for people to determine the financial outcomes and create a way to adapt to life’s financial challenges easier. As mentioned before, these circumstances could allow users to have access to funds which could limit their reliance on credit, ultimately reducing debt. There are a multitude of use cases that payment streaming can benefit such as “subscription” models such as rent. Streaming payments benefit both parties of transactions as the requesting entity can trust that they will receive the payment continuously as opposed to in one lump sum payment. Ultimately, as this technology is adopted, it will be exciting to see how payment streaming will create a more fair, convenient, and mutually beneficial financial system.\n\n***If you LOVE this article, are you against sending a tip to Cryptojeter.eth?

Currently, the project’s capabilities include payment streaming with gas less transfers, with real-time liquidity which allows its users to only require enough balance to keep their payment streams open. Furthermore, users do not incur a delay when withdrawing their funds. \n\nStreamflow is a startup founded in 2021 whose team includes [@imprfekt](https://twitter.com/imprfekt?s=21&t=HKaDWqeT71m1QOpdwiAzRA) and others. The platform is built on Solana and its current capabilities include streaming payments and token vesting with more options coming in the future such as a multisig wallet. In the future, Streamflow aims to expand cross-chain and onboard web2 projects onto the platform. Streamflow’s most recent round of funding was a 3.1 million dollar seed round with backers that include [Jump Crypto](https://mobile.twitter.com/jumpcryptohq), [Solana Ventures](https://twitter.com/solanaventures?lang=en), [GBV Capital](https://twitter.com/gbvofficial?lang=en), [AngelDAO](https://twitter.com/angeldaoorg), [Huobi Ventures](https://twitter.com/huobiventures?lang=en) and others. \n\nRoketo is another payment streaming platform built on the [NEAR protocol](https://twitter.com/nearprotocol?s=21&t=fbOfQH-ItSYRNF5qCpw58A) whose primary contributors come from Kikimora Labs. The core team includes [Taras Dovgal](https://twitter.com/tarasdovgal?s=21&t=M1qUr1bj0nbhFOfasGFgOw), [Olga Isaeva](https://twitter.com/olyflow?s=21&t=uhmNY24CggKkW3dNGRZqwg), [Vasilisa Versus](https://twitter.com/dcversus?s=21&t=TtmvHOfggCCZbllIIAOFsA), and over 20 others. Roketo is backed by [MetaWeb Ventures](https://mobile.twitter.com/metawebvc), [A&T Capital](https://twitter.com/ant_capital?s=21&t=vVrsk_8dA4U-LLSX4Qn4tQ),[Cogitent Ventures](https://twitter.com/cogitentv?s=21&t=zC-QgTxzxYj9dwbA31ldLQ), and [Move Capital](https://twitter.com/movecap?s=21&t=bbOzlhC0d07uGAI3Jwpacw). The company’s current capabilities include payroll, vesting, and airdropping. Regarding payroll, Rocket serves its customers by providing a quick solution to setting up wages for employees with transparency and low cost. Roketo advertises its ability to the preceding functions while also ensuring its customers have total control over their crypto currency. With regards to vesting, Roketo’s vesting product aids founders with streaming tokens to their investors as well as their employees. Within Roketo’s product, users can set cliffs for token distribution and keep distribution consistent. Lastly, for Rocketo’s airdrop offering, Roketo touts itself as the most affordable and intuitive product on the market. \n\nWith the aforementioned startups and most likely others who are focused on creating products to help users stream funds, one can imagine that there are implications of the success of this innovation. Payment streaming will provide more flexibility and create more control for people to have over their finances. This control can provide a way for people to determine the financial outcomes and create a way to adapt to life’s financial challenges easier. As mentioned before, these circumstances could allow users to have access to funds which could limit their reliance on credit, ultimately reducing debt. There are a multitude of use cases that payment streaming can benefit such as “subscription” models such as rent. Streaming payments benefit both parties of transactions as the requesting entity can trust that they will receive the payment continuously as opposed to in one lump sum payment. Ultimately, as this technology is adopted, it will be exciting to see how payment streaming will create a more fair, convenient, and mutually beneficial financial system.\n\n***If you LOVE this article, are you against sending a tip to Cryptojeter.eth?

"目前市面上加密货币钱包的种类繁多，但大多数钱包的使用技巧和操作你都真正的了解和掌握吗？而且我们能通过钱包这个便利窗口进入到一个庞大繁华的区块链世界，钱包不仅仅是一个转移存取代币的工具，而且它有非常多的其他实用功能，我们以下谈论点主要以市面上使用率最高的热门的钱包metamask小狐狸为例展开讲解以及由钱包的使用延伸到区块链浏览器的使用\n\n**1，语言的选择**\n\n小狐狸钱包是目前使用最为广泛的数字货币钱包，小狐狸钱包有两种版本的下载方式，通过电脑端Google商店安装浏览器插件版本和手机下载APP版本，两种版本的使用功能差不多，首先下载好钱包后，为了便于个人的使用习惯选择适合自己的的语言系统，我们可以通过如下操作完成语言设置\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F_GT72eAfyQI8zEPyF2wKg.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**2，助记词**\n\n通过设置中点击安全与隐私找到钱包的助记词，助记词和私匙是钱包最为重要的密码，掌握其中任一种即可在不需要密码的情况下开启钱包，并且这两样东西若是丢失，钱包中功能不会有任何备份，所以一定要保存好这两样东西\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FFYXkCktfXpesL2CCKVz8f.png\\&w=1920\\&q=90)\n\n**3，钱包网络状态**\n\n有一点需要注意，有的人在添加测试网络时，出现无法添加的情况，一般是因为关闭了钱包的测试网络添加按钮，通过设置按钮点开启动即可\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fwn2ClY1D7zVHcGWEbLXxo.png\\&w=1920\\&q=90)\n\n**4，钱包常规功能**\n\n我们能轻松便捷的通过小狐狸钱包内置功能完成转账，收款，购买，和兑换等功能，你需要知道在完成购买或者兑换时会收取大概1%的手续费（通过兑换功能兑换代币也会有代币的损失我们通常称之为无偿损失，这也无法避免。）\n\n**但我们可以通过点击“高级选项”调节兑换“滑点”来减少损失（在允许的范围内调节滑点大小），滑点百分比调节越小，兑换成功率会受到影响，所以通常选择一个合适的范围调节点1%—3%之间，滑点百分比越高成功的几率越高，但损失也会越大**\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F6TZ3sLZT2qykfgYmYd6ih.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n通过第3步的方式可以查看我们过往交互链接过的项目，如果曾经链接过的项目忘记了可以通过这种方式找到，也能通过这种方式掐断钱包和项目的默认链接状态或者点击4步直接断开与该项目的链接状态\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fu9nQLZRsuhbDjdy7ho\\_7H.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**5，交互卡链情况的处理**\n\n对于链上交互遇到比较拥堵的时候，严重的情况下一笔交易可能会卡住一两天，这种情况下我们应该怎么去处理掉这笔卡链交易（如果这种严重拥堵状况再次加手续费都无法完成），通常我们可以通过两种方式解决：\n\n第一种比较直接的方式挤掉所有前面未完成的交易，直接再次通过其他方式交互完成下一笔交易，在交易的时候，通过设置实时汽油费（这时设置GAS汽油费就应该根据当时情况设置更高数值才能顺利完成）\n\n第二种方式是点开钱包的设置找到“高级”选项功能启用自定义交易\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fy1VMd_ow3GZrLwMmMgQzU.png\\&w=1920\\&q=90)\n\n点击钱包的“活动”按钮找到最近的的一笔卡链未完成的交易找到nonce比如我这个是“132”记下这个数字，那么要挤掉这个未完成的交易，再下一次的交易中自定义就填写133，就会顺利过渡到下一笔交易\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F-iqEAgZvs6c6I2qHZQ3kj.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n小狐狸钱包它本身自带的链网络不多，我们可以通过如下网站自动添加所需要的各种网络，非常方便\n\n**二，区块浏览器的使用**\n\n通过钱包完成的链上交易我们可以通过钱包窗口进入到区块浏览器查看，区块浏览器会显示出此钱包所有在链上的活动痕迹，无处遁形，这也恰恰展示了区块链去中心化的魅力所在，学会使用它你可以查到任意钱包地址的持币情况和交易细节，更有助于了解区块链项目的背后的代币运行逻辑通过点击1，2步进入区块浏览器\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F9cnF0MsL_j8znMR35vit5.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**1，重要数据检索**\n\n在区块浏览器中我们能查看很多重要的数据信息，比如某个钱包地址状态是在卖出还是买入代币，代币时间线，代币来源，去往和获取方式等\n\n每个代币都有一个合约地址，我们可以像查询钱包地址一样，在检索栏输入这个合约地址这个合约地址所代表的代币信息都会被检索出来\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FKb9vHfsJvB8y7Wze-ytAb.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n在1中输入（上图所示）某个代币的名称，合约地址，以及哈希数能看到这个输入代号的所有链上情况\n\n在2中点开下拉键，能看到所有此钱包的代币，如果钱包中没有显示拥有的代币，可以通过这种方式获取代币合约添加到钱包中，比如我们要添加USDC代币到钱包，通过进入区块链浏览器，点击1，找到2中的的USDC，点开\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FctQkC6JiCySyg_GFO9YXO.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n就可以看到右边红框中的一串数字字母混合就是USDC的合约地址，复制合约地址，回到钱包下拉找到导入代币按钮，输入合约地址就可以成功添加代币名称到钱包\n\n**2，代币各种数据的位置**\n\n通过检索USDC代币，我们能看到USDC在链上的所有信息，这个地址钱包里代币的种类、代币名称、代币总供应量、总的持币地址数、价格、24小时涨跌幅度，当时市值，在偏右边的这个信息中可以看到USDC的合约地址、精度、官方网站、社交媒体链接等\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FefqBCgpmM8Eeg9YlMCKjq.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**3，“Transaction”及其他**\n\n在3中我们通过“[Transactions](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd58af9f90ebb67d4400a1268fae5fbcadab44777#transactions)”列查看这个钱包所有的代币活动行为：包括时间线，通过什么方式获得的代币（转账，swap，claim等等）代币时间线，代币来源，去往等\n\n交易的哈希值、区块高度、交易时间、被调用的合约地址、交易的以太币数量、交易耗费的Gas以及后面分类的代币列表：ERC-20(代币）,ERC-721（NFT）,ERC-1155(NFT)\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F-AwoWphsELMkKp2JRUkrS.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n**4，持币地址的分布**\n\n在页面下半部分，有一个非常重要信息：持币地址的分布\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2Fhn5VdCD9cRdjVBKtnzudd.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n在上图的界面里，持有USDC代币的地址由多到少依次排列，包括持币者的排名、地址、持币数量，以及占总供应量的百分比和对应的美元计价市值。\n\n这个界面可以探寻到非常多的重要信息。比如哪些著名地址持有了USDC；USDC的大户之间有没有代币转移，甚至抛售出货等等\n\n某个币种价格的波动，往往都会包含在这些消息中。当你决定进行某个项目的代币买卖时，这些信息显得非常重要，往往可以看清项目方背后言语的真实发展路径和用意。\n\n区块浏览器蕴含一个发币项目很多重要数据，由于篇幅原因没有做过多深入讲解，希望能给带给大家一些对区块浏览器使用的启发性思维。\n\n![本文作者：SnapFingersDAO内容部--@maik2hello](https://mirror.xyz/\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F_R5mgmAZg3aEcVJkLSYl0.png\\&w=3840\\&q=90)\n\n本文作者：SnapFingersDAO内容部--\\@maik2hello\n\n**SnapFingersDAO响指精选知识库：**\n\n**掌握更多币圈价值信息关注推特：**\n",

The global market for carbon credits is expected to be worth $1 billion by 2021, and the industry has already seen record highs in both volume and value.\n\nCarbon credits are financial products that represent 1 ton of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere. They can be purchased by individuals or companies in order to offset emissions from things like industrial production, delivery vehicles, or travel. The most common way of creating carbon credits is through agricultural or forestry practices, but nearly any project that reduces emissions can generate them.\n\nThe growth of the carbon credit market reflects a growing awareness of climate change and its effects on our planet. Governments are increasingly putting pressure on businesses to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and many large companies see buying carbon credits as an efficient way to meet those targets.\n\nWhat is the compliance market for carbon credits? A carbon credit is a certificate or permit representing the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Governments set a cap on how many tons of emissions certain sectors can release, and this is known as a cap-and-trade market. The cap represents the amount of greenhouse gases a government will allow to be released into the atmosphere, and emitters must trade to stay within that limit. So far, about 64 carbon compliance markets are now in operation around the world. The compliance market for carbon credits has been growing rapidly in recent years as countries have looked for ways to reduce their emissions and meet their climate change goals. In order to participate in these markets, companies must first become certified by an accredited body such as The Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) or The Gold Standard Foundation (GSF). Certification involves verifying that projects reduce emissions by an amount equal to or greater than what they claim on their application. Once certified, companies can sell their credits through online exchanges or directly to buyers such as governments or other businesses looking for ways to comply with emission caps set by regulators.\n\nThe carbon credit market is growing rapidly as companies and countries seek to reduce their emissions. The European compliance market projects that carbon prices will increase 88 percent by 2030, while the voluntary market is experiencing rapid growth. This growth is being driven by corporate net-zero goals and interest in meeting international climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement. \n \n\nVoluntary emissions reductions are those that companies make to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. This can be done through a number of methods, including investing in renewable energy or carbon credits. Voluntary reductions are not mandatory, meaning companies are not required to participate. Instead, they choose to do so out of their own volition.\nCritics of the voluntary market point out that this does not lower the overall amount of greenhouse gases released by buyers. They are simply offset, which gives corporations a way to claim they are eco-friendly without reducing their overall emissions. Critics call this \"greenwashing.\" \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RPP9WU3wamPURU2bx7t7l.png?height=495&width=853)\n\nThe voluntary carbon market is a market in which participants can buy and sell credits to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. The voluntary carbon market operates largely unchecked by federal or local regulators. This has led to concerns about the quality of the credits being sold. Verra, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group founded by environmental and business leaders to improve quality assurance in voluntary carbon markets, has set the most widely used standard to validate those credits called the Verified Carbon Standard.. \n \n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is not the lead agency when it comes to regulating carbon credits, but they have been involved in many different ways. For example, the USDA has helped fund carbon capturing projects and published data to help agricultural businesses capitalize on this growing market. In addition, the USDA is part of a proposed climate partnership initiative that would fund conservation projects on working land and quantify the carbon and sustainability benefits that come as a result of those projects. This would be an important step in helping agriculture reduce its overall greenhouse gas emissions footprint. \n \n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Vj3JsY_--frbjv7Emw8e2.png?height=490&width=865)\n\nAre states creating any kind of market for carbon trading?\n\nYes, California is the only state with a state cap-and-trade market. By 2030, the state aims to lower emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels. About 450 entities targeted by the market must deliver an overall 15 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the \"business-as-usual\" scenario in 2020.", "timestamp": 1656080553, "digest": "G8zSfEpYEygSN27EWeKbmF45JqCFMw0IiJQh7ryHAPg", "contributor": "0x8D0f4124E67f32D4211045a15242EC8B11daB6c2"}

I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). In his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. If information is allowed to propagate, then it will find its way into every nook and cranny. Sometimes, this can be useful to society. This can be for better or worse, but cryptography is a tool that allows us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA cryptographic protocol tends to have three goals:\n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, most of the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum only focuses on integrity and authentication goals. It forms the backbone of decentralization as it allows anyone to verify:\n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nWe call this property *public verifiability* as anyone can fetch the public data and check if the computation for it was performed correctly. As you can imagine, this is crucial to protect coins held by users on the network and to protect the integrity of smart contracts. Because all the data is publicly available, it also implies the running default is a lack of financial privacy.\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\n**Not an anonymous currency.** Many people find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange at first. I suspect this is the case because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use in the dark web. The very name *crypto*currency leads to that misunderstanding. Unfortunately for criminals, they are the most traceable currencies in the world and it is a really bad tool for their desired purpose. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose.\n\n**Privacy-coins do exist.** Confidentiality of financial transactions on a global scale is a sought-after feature. A number of systems exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. is a sought-after property and there are a number of systems with strong confidentiality including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. I believe this frontier of research and development is essential for the continued growth of decentralised finance (DeFi).\n\nA fun project is to list the existing DeFI applications and identify which aspects can benefit from financial privacy. But for now, we do not concern ourselves with confidentiality. It is not needed to understand how cryptography is immediately used in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThe cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is basic. There are only two primitives to consider. A commitment scheme to protect the integrity of the blockchain and digital signatures to authenticate actions from an end-user. We have put together dedicated articles for both primitives and in this article we provide a brief explanation of each.\n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature. A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity. They can compute the credentials (public-private key pair) locally on their machine. The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer. A signature is timeless and it can be verified at any point in time. In fact, we can check all historical transactions in a network like Bitcoin and verify the signer was indeed authorised to spend the coins.\n\nWhat about zero knowledge proofs?", "timestamp": 1656080688, "digest": "a4Y0TrLL7BcS8rarDfDVQW6HJKSTydm5K7u2sEqC2wA", "contributor": "0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5"}
{"id": "-FgAUwNGxd9FfRty2qHQ67erplMstGtpon0JkgW-r9g", "title": "The Future of Actively Managed On-Chain Asset Protocols: Unlock the Hidden Socialfi Property of Enzyme", "body": "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*CIAkUuBbPEx6Vn67)\n\n***By Kyle, Investment Manager@Bing Ventures***\n\nLike Stablecoin, on-chain asset management has been one of the first blockchain scenarios to land. The DAO’s organizational structure naturally removes organizational barriers to decentralized asset management. Enzyme, a pioneer of multi-chain asset management protocols, was created in 2016. More importantly, it can use tokens to incentivise asset issuers and liquidity participants to tap into more decentralized financial scenarios.\n\nFrom flatter investment decision-making systems, to incentives to participate in product beta versions, to the formation of vast armies of capital in the upcoming metaverse. These new tools will be a force to be reckoned with once the asset management protocol has achieved the integration of tokens with the community.\n\nEnzyme allows users to make speculative bets using liquid assets. With the development of decentralized asset management protocols and the emergence of new ways to interact with the “X-to-earn” social paradigm beyond DeFi boundaries, we can expect to see an influx of user demand for such tokens.\n\nNew players are entering the new management game.\n\n## Decentralized asset management: an attempt to return to classical equilibrium\n\nDue to the nature of centralization and barriers, traditional asset management is a high-cost and high-friction industry. The core of decentralized asset management is to optimize the traditional asset management process.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*j8yfKo1c9dmnsVoV)\n\n*source: coingecko*\n\n### 1/ 9 advantages of decentralized asset management\n\nDecentralized asset management utilizing blockchain and smart contract technology has the following advantages:\n\n\\*\\*1. Effectively reducing start-up costs. \\*\\*This is arguably the most important and immediate improvement. In traditional finance, creating a fund requires high compliance, registration and notarization fees. But the cost of starting a fund on a blockchain is low.\n\n\\*\\*2. Greatly shorten the startup time. \\*\\*The traditional fund creation process can take months. The decentralized alternative only takes a few minutes.\n\n\\*\\*3.Anyone can be a fund manager. \\*\\*Blockchains and smart contracts allow anyone with a computer to build their own investment vehicles.\n\n\\*\\*4.Anyone can be a fund investor. \\*\\*Top fund investment opportunities are limited to qualified investors with net assets of several million dollars, while decentralized asset management does not limit the size of funds.\n\n\\*\\*5. Strictly enforced terms of authorization. \\*\\*Traditional fund rules and licensing agreements are often enforced subjectively by fund managers and can still be broken at their discretion. Blockchain-based funds can make rules strictly algorithmic, leaving fund managers with no choice but to follow predefined rules.\n\n\\*\\*6. Based on the principle of untrusteeship/no trust. \\*\\*In blockchain-based funds, fund managers do not have the right to trust or withdraw investors’ money, but can only use it to execute certain investments.\n\n\\*\\*7. More liquidity. \\*\\*Most traditional fund redemptions are usually quarterly. Blockchain-based funds can greatly increase investor liquidity, and protocols can allow instant redemption depending on the actual state of the fund’s position on the chain.\n\n\\*\\*8. Transparency. \\*\\*Foundations in the traditional asset management world are often closed and relatively opaque because of their reliance on real-life contracts, external auditors and non-real-time reporting. A fund built on blockchain is completely transparent, with all changes in its portfolio updated in real time.\n\n\\*\\*9. Composability. \\*\\*Decentralized finance has evolved into a set of interconnected and modular monetary Legos. This allows decentralized asset management to easily plug into other DeFi services for trading, extending leverage, insurance, swaps and other product capabilities. That gives investors more choice\n\n### 2/ The appeal of active on-chain money management\n\nAsset management in DeFi can be divided into the following three categories:\n\n1\\. Active on-chain fund management (active management)\n\n2\\. Index products and basket currencies (passively managed)\n\n3\\. Structured products and vault based products\n\nThis paper deals only with the field of active on-chain fund management. Historically, actively managed funds have generally outperformed passive basket indices, or DPI indices. Actively managed funds tend to do better in downturns. Of course, passive asset management protocols usually have advantages in attracting capital, but in maintaining the efficiency of capital operation, they often encounter the problem of liquidity disloyalty, which can only be overcome by the unsustainable way of high-yield mining.\n\nMotivating teams and users to develop high-yield Alpha strategies is an issue that needs to be considered in every asset management agreement, regardless of type. But with passive asset management protocols, the big returns are often available only to a few. This can lead to a long time gap between protocol product development and capital strategy execution. Active funds, by contrast, can change strategies and compete for capital more quickly because of the large number of managers and often only need to capture high-return speculative assets and trade in secondary markets.\n\nOf course, the discretion of asset management protocols is also a double-edged sword. High yields may be a moat for passive management protocols, but robustness and diversification are preferred for active management protocols. Ongoing policy maintenance and optimization is a good starting point for socializing. Recent large-scale DeFi liquidations have proven that agreements that are divorced from communities and violate the principle of decentralization cannot ensure capital efficiency.\n\n## A difficult attempt to socialize asset management\n\n### 1/Cater to the personalized needs of crypto users\n\nOn-chain asset management ensures that investors have no trust in the custody of capital. Transparent ledgers reduce the cost burden of complex accounting and auditing. At the same time, DeFi’s permitless access provides users with open access rights. This means that the cost of launching a hedge fund in the blockchain world is limited to a small amount of Gas fees.\n\nHowever, the TVL of decentralized asset management protocols is small. Why hasn’t something with such high product fit expanded rapidly so far? The main thing is that the space is still getting more social traction. While this segment of the market may be immature relative to other DeFi products, its acceptance so far has been very encouraging.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*wZZaZxYBHowzDo5n)\n\n*source: Enzyme*\n\nCryptographic native protocols are building a toolkit for decentralized money management in a variety of ways. We may see crypto-native asset management protocols become popular before more mainstream traditional institutions take action. Social tokens allow users to make interesting trades on speculative assets. These on-chain assets are traded based on individual needs in a decentralized asset management approach.\n\nWeb3.0 and crypto native tokens may not simply be a one-to-one copy of TradFi onto the blockchain. While cost reduction is important, it is mechanism design and the development of unique products based on smart contracts that are likely to attract users. Unfortunately, innovative decentralized asset management infrastructures often have little to offer in terms of innovative mechanisms.\n\n### 2/ Why hasn’t there been a pandemic?\n\nThe asset management habits of crypto users are often fast-paced, which conflicts with the long-cycle nature of asset management. A step-by-step strategy is clearly unacceptable to users in an area characterized by the highest volatility. So highly leveraged crypto derivatives tend to be more popular. How the asset management protocol provides these policies and scenarios to users with low risk is very important. Note that I said low-risk offering, not low-risk creating profit.\n\nFor actively managed funds, it takes years of continuous management to have a chance of producing long-term average returns. For fund managers, the process is also relatively long. The cost of trust is higher than the copy trading function of a centralized exchange. So how asset management protocols ensure that users build trust in the face of these long turnaround periods is also important. So far, vault design and community fund rewards are viable mechanisms.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*sdqKbNItcSFVsGyR)\n\n*source: Token Terminal*\n\nIn addition, DeFi users tend to prefer the feeling of being in control of their money, and some good fund managers may not necessarily like full exposure to the chain portfolio. This prevents the agreement from attracting higher-quality fund managers and a larger number of DeFi users.\n\nHow to bridge the boundaries between privacy and initiative is important. Instant redemption, users’ rights to portfolio assets and the empowerment of managers’ equity are also important. From this point of view, investment kols with their own community attributes tend to be the priority of decentralized asset management protocols, while social tokens and NFT have obvious advantages in increasing tool availability and user asset flow.\n\n## Enzyme: Eliminate capital waste and welcome social return\n\n### 1/Integrate protocols and portfolio assets to improve capital efficiency\n\nEnzyme is a modification of Melon Protocol. They released version V4 this year, which has a lot of innovation beyond basic features like decentralized lending, AMM pools, and agricultural capabilities. Fund managers have access to a large number of functions outside the protocol. This protocol integrates Polygon, Uniswap V3, Opyn, Compound, Aave and other protocols.\n\nAt the same time, Gas Relayer’s new features allow asset managers to eliminate the high ethereum Gas fee burden and redefine the cost of the entire vault. To fully understand how this works, as well as its implications and best practices, we will soon be Posting a blog covering this.\n\nV4 allows users to customize the token/ticker symbol and customize around the user’s brand identity. Users can also transfer shares to new investors without redemption. This creates a secondary market for the user’s Treasury stock, which gives it the opportunity to trade. Users can invest in more than 200 assets here. The platform also enables organizations to run their own investment funds using Gnosis multi-signature wallets.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*MlO7nAiNukplj6sA)\n\n*source: Enzyme*\n\nEnzyme solves the problem of capital inefficiencies by integrating deployment with multiple protocols. Increase the availability of the agreement by borrowing and escrow assets. So Enzyme is definitely on the move when it comes to making broader gains. The allocation and use of idle assets to obtain immediate income increases the source of liquidity and income options. Better use of idle assets and LP tokens is an important reason why Enzyme is ahead.\n\n### 2/The key to winning: Personalized social investing trends\n\nEnzyme’s own Treasury creates a personalized vault, while users can easily copy on-chain policies. These designs greatly enhance users’ social security and freedom. Enzyme also improves security and depositor protection through a 7-day review period.\n\nV4 introduced a protocol fee for this protocol. The fee is a tax on the amount of assets under management in each vault. This is calculated continuously with respect to the annualized target percentage and results in the automatic casting of a certain number of additional shares for each vault and allocation to the agreement itself. The agreement uses a repo mechanism to force fund managers to demand MLN tokens. In addition, the burning of the MLN used for buybacks creates deflationary pressures on tokens.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*H6fCbtAAozyf-AQX)\n\n*source: DefiLlama*\n\nIn traditional finance, investing in hedge funds can be difficult for the average person. Launching hedge funds could be harder. Enzyme simplified and innovated the fund launch process, and the openness of the network they built in addition to improving transparency, democratized access for all investors. After years of development, Enzyme’s TVL hovers around $30 million.\n\nWe think Enzyme should pursue more social attempts to monetize smart elitist investment management. For investors, Enzyme lowers barriers to entry and improves transparency. As long as the Enzyme protocol continues to integrate and expand the scope of assets and focus on optimizing the long-term direction of composable financial instruments, the investability of assets across the chain will continue to increase.\n\nEven during bear markets, asset management protocols should consider a profit strategy on the downside. Fund managers can hold stablecoin assets and avoid the downward trend in profits. On this basis, how to create more investment options for users in a falling market is the problem to consider. For the two core stakeholders, it is only a matter of time before AUM rises in the future, as long as their enthusiasm can be stimulated.", "timestamp": 1656080693, "digest": "2a0GYBhiBG9Wp85mV0UVSxBJ9OZwaFDa5vvOopTZe04", "contributor": "0x867A3f354c0eCB6622aEf1bF14C3BE79338AD889"}

It details the story of the Corleone family, focusing on the patriarch Vito Corleone and his son Michael. The novel covers the years 1945 to 1955, and also includes flashbacks to events that occurred in 1902.\n\nThe book has been translated into over 20 languages and sold over 26 million copies worldwide. In 1972 it was adapted into a film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, which won three Academy Awards including Best Picture. The sequel, The Godfather: Part II was released in 1974 and received five Oscar nominations including Best Picture. A third movie based on Puzo's original screenplay but not directed by Coppola—The Godfather: Part III—was released in 1990 after Puzo's death; it received mixed reviews but was successful commercially nonetheless.\n\nPuzo wrote The Godfather as an attempt to \"capture...the strength of the American family unit.\" He wanted to show how \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\" while also exploring themes such as trustworthiness, betrayal, love and hate. Critics have praised Puzo's skillful characterization and plotting; many consider TheGodfather one of the greatest novels ever written about organized crime or America itself.", "timestamp": 1656081507, "digest": "7iub2av41mL2XYFveELJITtMV7igp5anRn2uqhzP3hM", "contributor": "0x230Fc4cdF11bdf8B0FBe6F43b154d19458c74D4c"}

Little, everyday decisions will either take you to the life you desire or to disaster by default. The Compound Effect is an easy-to-use, step-by-step operating system that allows you to multiply your success, chart your progress, and achieve any desire. If you’re serious about living an extraordinary life, use the power of The Compound Effect to create the success you want.\n\nI found this book very inspiring because it teaches how small changes over time can lead to big results. It’s a great reminder that we need to be deliberate in our actions and make conscious choices if we want to achieve our goals. I also liked how the author included case studies and examples of people who have applied these principles in their own lives with great success. This was helpful for me because it showed me that these concepts are not just theoretical but can be put into practice and used successfully by anyone willing to do the work required.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great book for anyone looking for real world strategies on how to create lasting change in their lives. It’s based on sound principles and provides clear instructions on how best to apply them so that anyone can see results if they commit themselves fully.\"", "timestamp": 1656082475, "digest": "WFgy3GejE-sQc5Uz8o54T-XZI8f2EKUV2fWfVQtqy7M", "contributor": "0x1D062534056a880C41c996F877CDcd956513ffa7"}

The term was popularized by Nassim Taleb in his book of the same name, which discusses the unpredictability of rare events in finance and other fields.\n\nBlack swans can be positive or negative events; for example, a company's successful IPO may be seen as a positive black swan, while its bankruptcy would be seen as a negative black swan. Black swans are typically outside of the realm of normal expectations and thus difficult to predict.\n\nThe existence of black swans is often used to argue against the use of historical data in financial analysis. Many believe that past performance cannot reliably indicate future results, because it's impossible to know which unexpected events will occur and have a significant impact on future outcomes.

一，NFTTrack的简单介绍\n\n一句话介绍蓝星对于nfttrack的定义：一个通过数据分析，追踪高胜率高回报地址的nft工具。\n\n推特：<https://twitter.com/NFTTrack> ，1.46万关注。\n\ndiscord：<https://discord.gg/28GA48hnmm> ，1430人。\n\n官方使用帮助手册：\n\n[🎒 NFTTrack Handbook](https://mirror.xyz/nfttrack.eth/6T-4NjVH0m0k3wfpTUbd_SPSvURz2nQp8L4qfu8g9JI)\n\n现在NFTTrack只有手机端，网页端也在计划之中，安卓和苹果手机都可以在应用商店搜索nfttrack下载到，苹果手机不需要国外苹果id就可以下载到。\n\n## 二,NFTtrack的功能介绍\n\n建议打开梯子来使用NFTTtrack，否则只能体验到一部分功能。\n\n下载好之后，打开手机，就会出现discover页面。\n\n![1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ruHknvr2ipjxKSGuTdmr0.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n先点击右下角的me，连接钱包，此处蓝星选择连接的是小狐狸钱包。可以看到，如果你的地址跟推特关联了，会自动显示你的推特名称。\n\n![2](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qF8DYbgZX-C0q947KExqL.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**下方有三个主菜单按钮，分别是巨鲸-top whale ，收藏品-collections，个人资料-me .**\n\n### 1, 巨鲸 top whale页面：following ,  discover,  rank\n\n**following 关注页面**\n\n点击左下角的top whale，再点击following，钱包签名以及推特授权之后，就可以看到下图，展示了你追踪的地址的交易记录，他们买了哪些nft，卖出了哪些nft ，mint了哪些nft。\n\n![3](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3yI3Lmp0eFP47GIhpJVj7.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**蓝星建议：卖出这里，如果能够加上当时买入价格或者mint 价格为多少，数量为多少，赚了多少，回报比多少，持有多长时间，就更好了。现在只是简单列出卖出收到了多少eth，了解不了更详细的信息**。\n\n![4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I3gw9ltXVQFUjKy5yDdFC.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**discover探索页面**\n\n探索页面，主要聚焦于巨鲸现在的交易行为。分为whalefomo, 以及whales activity。\n\n![5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SqDqPVYugmNnEjQyTRJKg.png?height=1722&width=792)\n\n点击whalefomo右边的more，会跳转到收藏品collections页面的whalefomo页面，可以查看不同时间段巨鲸们都在买卖什么样的nft。比如下图，有3个巨鲸在1个小时前购买了31只spunmonkes，总交易量14.62，平均价格为0.0153，现在的地板价为0.0048。\n\n![6](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5Z61xwzfZN-ko-QylTBEU.png?height=1644&width=794)\n\n点击spunmonkes,可以查看该项目的一些数据情况，比如地板价变化趋势，蓝筹指数，持有地址，手机端也集成了opensea, gem, looksrare，项目推特以及项目官网。\n\n**蓝星建议：应当集成x2y2，现在很多新项目，x2y2的交易量都是第二的。作为一个nft工具，不集成市场份额第二的nft交易平台X2Y2 ，感觉有点奇怪，并且X2Y2 的手续费只是0.5%，相比其他平台，可以为玩家节省蛮多费用**。\n\n![7](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ts30KJksNflWjjjEACCQK.png?height=1736&width=796)\n\n下方还有筹码分布，持有该项目的地址都持有哪些蓝筹项目，该项目的交易记录，上架数量等信息。\n\n**蓝星注：此处当然是筹码越分散，买的巨鲸地址越多，蓝筹指数不断增高，上架数量越少更好**。\n\n![8](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JUw1kOzCTrx-xSJW4Em2S.png?height=1676&width=788)\n\n回到topwhale的discover页面\n\n![9](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ePxNQBmirYF6GID_ERPV_.png?height=1720&width=808)\n\n点击hiten.eth，跳转到下图，有关于该巨鲸的数据，卖出排名，巨鲸排名，推特多少粉丝。\n\n![10](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/esrEUlMX8_SZ2B3tGPYgh.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n其中fliprate#4指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖的排名。\n\nwhale#503指：一段时间内该地址所有nft价值的排名。\n\nreturn指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报率。\n\nprofits指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报绝对值。\n\nfliprate指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖占所有交易次数的比率，蓝星这里理解为胜率。\n\ntotal floor value指：该地址现在持有的nft按照地板价计算的总eth价值。\n\ntotal cost指：该地址现在持有的nft当时买入的总成本。\n\nnfts指：该地址现在持有的nft总数量。\n\n显然，关注的指标，return 以及fliprate，还有total floor value/ total cost的比值应当越大越好，代表该地址的历史表现更好，该地址更值得关注。\n\nwhalefomo这里重点关注买入某个nft的巨鲸数量和买入卖出数量。\n\n**再点击rank，来到巨鲸排名页面，在这里可以发现很多值得关注的巨鲸地址，可以关注他们，追踪他们的交易记录，做追随策略**。\n\n如下图，胜率排名第一的761.eth，现在持有1180个nft，低买高卖的nft数量为95个，近7天有113次交易记录。\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jfd-GpE3_M224yswnbSrs.png?height=1600&width=804)\n\n可以点击tennex.eth进入该地址主页，分析其数据。如下图，卖出的回报率return为11.88%，卖出利润profits为0.83，fliprate为81.25，这个数据不算高。现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为12.49，现在持有的nft总买入成本为5.9，12.49/5.9=2.11，这个比值不错，相当于翻倍了。下方就是该地址都持有哪些nft，以及该地址的买入卖出和mint行为。\n\n![12](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UQXdEKyl2vQpEvTji6YVN.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**再点击top whale>rank>return，进入按照30天卖出nft的回报率排名的巨鲸地址页面**。\n\n如下图，近30天回报率排名第一的是sina.eth这个地址，现在持有392个nft，近30天回报率1438倍，现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为1121个eth。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zXDjXHcBtPzhiw4qFzZQN.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**点击sina.eth，可以进入该地址的数据分析页面。卖出的nft回报率为35.6倍，利润绝对值为113个eth，胜率为90%。再看现在持有的nft除以买入总成本的比值，也很大，所以这个地址值得关注**。\n\n![14](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MP6mIbynF-_8brIHDzDMP.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**同样的，排名第三的地址也值得关注，但是最好去看下该地址价值最大的nft的组成。如果所有回报率都是早期持有bayc带来的，最近的交易记录反倒是亏损，就不太值得关注。**\n\n![15](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oNJIjuIs2CZAkwm-fPH1.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n### 2，collections：watchlist-观察列表，nextbluechip-下一个蓝筹项目，whalefomo-巨鲸在买啥\n\n点击下方菜单栏的collections按钮，如果你关注了某个项目，观察列表就会出现这些项目，可以看到总交易量，现在地板价，以及地板价相比前一天的涨幅。下图中可以看到，it’s nothing 以及 moonrunners 都在一天中涨了3倍。\n\n![16](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RBaxID40sPgIzmdCekmc8.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击nextbluechip，分别有1天，3天，7天的蓝筹指数变化情况。\n\n![17](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjHpeDct8D36KeEQyjp-t.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击whale fomo就是按照不同时间，有多少数量的巨鲸买入了多少数量的nft。moonrunners总量1万张，过去6小时，有44个巨鲸买入了56张。\n\n![18](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7E7nvl_2N4kuPL5twiRC-.png?height=1712&width=794)\n\n至于个人资料页面，就是你关注了什么项目，你关注的人的列表，还有你自己地址持有的nft，交易记录等。**因为没有集成x2y2，所以这个交易记录是不准确的，比如我是买了9个serious investor,这里只显示买了4个**。\n\n![19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pMZWXYhTuamF8Bzl28kWD.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n## 三，如何使用NFTtrack，心得体会\n\n1，首先当然是collections菜单栏的whale fomo值得关注，如果一个nft项目，有超过5个whale在集中大量购买，就要引起注意。如果买入的whale超过了100个地址，就要仔细分析是不是已经fomo到顶点了。一般来说，地板价和蓝筹指数随着whale fomo买入，都在不断抬升，就要引起注意。但是如果一天内地板价涨幅过高，比如超过3倍，也要小心你跟着买入是接盘侠，这个时候就要用到之前提到的nft 项目的判断模型。\n\n[bluestarpin.eth📜,📜+X2Y2 on Twitter: \"1，大势，团队，社区，赋能，数据分析。这5个点，是我总结下来判断NFT的一个框架。接下来分别说一说。 / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/lanxing4/status/1525086704079544320?s=20&t=D0EP3W8aRurILRDXmAk5hQ)\n\n2，其次是collections菜单栏的nextbluechip的蓝筹变化指数也值得关注。一个项目的蓝筹指数从0到30%的变化过程，往往伴随着地板价的大幅拉升。\n\n3，然后就是top whale菜单栏的rank页面的return的排名，可以发现一些值得关注的巨鲸地址。此处蓝星建议nfttrack开发地址的nft价值构成分析。我需要知道一个地址现在持有的nft的金额构成，以及回报率是哪些项目占据主导的。如果一个地址只是靠几笔交易获得了大的回报，那么这个地址的胜率就不是太好。就是要关注高胜率，高回报的地址，并且是最近30天也要有交易的，然后一定要跟自己的资金体量差不多的，毕竟适合自己的才是重要的。另外，推特粉丝太多的地址可以加入观察列表，但是不能全信，因为推特粉丝多，很多地址都是自己的小号，主力地址是被隐藏的。该地址的回报是有大量交易做支撑的，且资金体量跟你自己的差多，过去30天低买高卖的胜率超过85%，那么就值得关注。个人建议关注的地址要少而精，不要超过10个地址。关注地址列表也要不断的去芜存菁，根据你观察的胜率和回报率进行不断更新。\n\n##

The term was popularized by Nassim Taleb in his book of the same name, which discusses the unpredictability of rare events in finance and other fields.\n\nBlack swans can be positive or negative events; for example, a company's successful IPO may be seen as a positive black swan, while its bankruptcy would be seen as a negative black swan. Black swans are typically outside of the realm of normal expectations and thus difficult to predict.\n\nThe existence of black swans is often used to argue against the use of historical data in financial analysis. Many believe that past performance cannot reliably indicate future results, because it's impossible to know which unexpected events will occur and have a significant impact on future outcomes. This means that attempting to make decisions based on past trends may lead investors astray, as unforeseen events can cause these trends to reverse course abruptly.", "timestamp": 1656082181, "digest": "KaoycrvigGctTvDsM4xQBEkamu-yc0Liopx8LwAAfCI", "contributor": "0x26b6896bBbf5059e6fAf168945AeF5906bF570fA"}

LayerZero官方有一定合作关系，博Layerzero发币预期\n\n所以，对于Gh0stly Gh0sts这个NFT来说，全链协议的意义是啥？\n\n### 什么是全链？\n\n比如说，小幽灵Gh0stly Gh0sts就同时分布在7条链上（以太坊、Polygon、Arbitrum、Optimism、BSC、Avalanche、Fantom），我们可以通过跨链互操作性协议 LayerZero在不同的链之间进行转换，从而达到节省交易费用或者套利的效果。\n\n### 全链有什么优势吗？\n\n比如说，项目方在发行期间，可以考虑在多个layer2进行mint，可以很好地降低GAS消耗，而且不同的链目标人群也不同，有利于项目吸取不同链的流量。\n\n这是从NFT在应用层面的理解，关于技术方面的可以看看这篇文章，我觉得讲得还蛮好的。\n\n[https://foresightnews.pro/article/detail/2100](https://foresightnews.pro/article/detail/2100)\n\n我们还是回归到吃饭上面，说错了，是发币上面。\n\n### LayerZero发币了吗？\n\n还没。\n\n从目前已经融资的情况来看，发币是肯定的，而且以全链的应用场景，估值是有想象空间的。\n\n2021年9月，LayerZero Labs完成600万美元A轮融资，Multicoin和Binance Labs领投，Multicoin和Binance Labs领投，Sino Global Capital、Defiance等参投\n\n2022年3月，LayerZero Labs完成1.35亿美元融资，估值10亿美元，FTX Ventures、红杉资本与a16z领投。\n\n最近又在进行新一轮的融资，估值大概在30亿美元。\n\n### 如何体验LayerZero？\n\n**1、Stargate**\n\n链接：（<https://stargate.finance/>）\n\n集多项目功能于一身，桥、DEX、Farm、质押，最高的时候TVL有40亿，目前10亿左右。\n\n虽然Stargate已经发币，但是作为LayerZero上面锁仓量最大的项目，交互了它就是交互了LayerZero。\n\na. 跨链交易\n\n选择不同的链之间，进行交易\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FK6rq8n-REm4yML5iZsolY.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nb. 增加LP token\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FMjWeFod4TI1C9jy6vdy9r.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nc. 质押LP token\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FdTUZmSZW6Z9QlvJzUOo4q.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\nd. 质押产生的 $STG 代币\n\n![](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FcQJBAwKbYAuM0l0UxbTf8.png&w=3840&q=90)\n\n就这几步完事了，每周交互几次，而且质押稳定币的收益还不算低，将近7%了，其实我没太懂，为何可以给到这么高的收益，毕竟TVL也不算小。\n\n考虑到安全性，我没敢把大仓位的稳定币搞进来，毕竟熊市了还是怕黑客搞事情，你们要是谁对这个质押的安全性有研究的，欢迎私聊我，一起聊聊。\n\n除了这个最大的协议之外，还有一些大家看情况交互。\n\n**2、gh0stlygh0sts**\n\n就是刚才说的全链NFT，下面是不同的链的购买地址，现在的价格是真的挺便宜的，有兴趣的买个玩玩\n\n[https://linktr.ee/b00tique](https://linktr.ee/b00tique)\n\n**3、parakeet.dao**\n\nNFT的跨链桥\n\n[https://www.parakeetdao.com/](https://www.parakeetdao.com/)\n\n**4、tiny dino**\n\n全链的像素NFT。\n\n[https://opensea.io/collection/tiny-dinos-eth](https://opensea.io/collection/tiny-dinos-eth)\n\n其他就没有太成熟的生态可以体验，重点是第一个**Stargate。**\n\n哦对，今天下午Stargate 发布更新 OP 代币分配的提案，计划将 100 万枚 OP 代币中的 70 万枚用于流动性挖矿计划，剩余 30 万枚用于合作伙伴计划，两项计划均将持续 6 个月。\n\n格局还是可以的，怪不得熊市了TVL还能撑住。\n\n以上就是我整理的关于LayerZero的介绍和项目交互建议，希望对大家撸毛有所帮助。", "timestamp": 1656082163, "digest": "e3j2sgqRZlYbeRcxtVALIJ4GMN63DH9oK_nNMg19VvI", "contributor": "0xfE9C2d9423Bb34a10EE5cdab28EBAdfb236A81c4"}

二,NFTtrack的功能介绍\n\n建议打开梯子来使用NFTTtrack，否则只能体验到一部分功能。\n\n下载好之后，打开手机，就会出现discover页面。\n\n![1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ruHknvr2ipjxKSGuTdmr0.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n先点击右下角的me，连接钱包，此处蓝星选择连接的是小狐狸钱包。可以看到，如果你的地址跟推特关联了，会自动显示你的推特名称。\n\n![2](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qF8DYbgZX-C0q947KExqL.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**下方有三个主菜单按钮，分别是巨鲸-top whale ，收藏品-collections，个人资料-me .**\n\n### 1, 巨鲸 top whale页面：following ,  discover,  rank\n\n**following 关注页面**\n\n点击左下角的top whale，再点击following，钱包签名以及推特授权之后，就可以看到下图，展示了你追踪的地址的交易记录，他们买了哪些nft，卖出了哪些nft ，mint了哪些nft。\n\n![3](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3yI3Lmp0eFP47GIhpJVj7.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**蓝星建议：卖出这里，如果能够加上当时买入价格或者mint 价格为多少，数量为多少，赚了多少，回报比多少，持有多长时间，就更好了。现在只是简单列出卖出收到了多少eth，了解不了更详细的信息**。\n\n![4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I3gw9ltXVQFUjKy5yDdFC.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**discover探索页面**\n\n探索页面，主要聚焦于巨鲸现在的交易行为。分为whalefomo, 以及whales activity。\n\n![5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SqDqPVYugmNnEjQyTRJKg.png?height=1722&width=792)\n\n点击whalefomo右边的more，会跳转到收藏品collections页面的whalefomo页面，可以查看不同时间段巨鲸们都在买卖什么样的nft。比如下图，有3个巨鲸在1个小时前购买了31只spunmonkes，总交易量14.62，平均价格为0.0153，现在的地板价为0.0048。\n\n![6](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5Z61xwzfZN-ko-QylTBEU.png?height=1644&width=794)\n\n点击spunmonkes,可以查看该项目的一些数据情况，比如地板价变化趋势，蓝筹指数，持有地址，手机端也集成了opensea, gem, looksrare，项目推特以及项目官网。\n\n**蓝星建议：应当集成x2y2，现在很多新项目，x2y2的交易量都是第二的。作为一个nft工具，不集成市场份额第二的nft交易平台X2Y2 ，感觉有点奇怪，并且X2Y2 的手续费只是0.5%，相比其他平台，可以为玩家节省蛮多费用**。\n\n![7](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ts30KJksNflWjjjEACCQK.png?height=1736&width=796)\n\n下方还有筹码分布，持有该项目的地址都持有哪些蓝筹项目，该项目的交易记录，上架数量等信息。\n\n**蓝星注：此处当然是筹码越分散，买的巨鲸地址越多，蓝筹指数不断增高，上架数量越少更好**。\n\n![8](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JUw1kOzCTrx-xSJW4Em2S.png?height=1676&width=788)\n\n回到topwhale的discover页面\n\n![9](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ePxNQBmirYF6GID_ERPV_.png?height=1720&width=808)\n\n点击hiten.eth，跳转到下图，有关于该巨鲸的数据，卖出排名，巨鲸排名，推特多少粉丝。\n\n![10](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/esrEUlMX8_SZ2B3tGPYgh.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n其中fliprate#4指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖的排名。\n\nwhale#503指：一段时间内该地址所有nft价值的排名。\n\nreturn指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报率。\n\nprofits指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报绝对值。\n\nfliprate指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖占所有交易次数的比率，蓝星这里理解为胜率。\n\ntotal floor value指：该地址现在持有的nft按照地板价计算的总eth价值。\n\ntotal cost指：该地址现在持有的nft当时买入的总成本。\n\nnfts指：该地址现在持有的nft总数量。\n\n显然，关注的指标，return 以及fliprate，还有total floor value/ total cost的比值应当越大越好，代表该地址的历史表现更好，该地址更值得关注。\n\nwhalefomo这里重点关注买入某个nft的巨鲸数量和买入卖出数量。\n\n**再点击rank，来到巨鲸排名页面，在这里可以发现很多值得关注的巨鲸地址，可以关注他们，追踪他们的交易记录，做追随策略**。\n\n如下图，胜率排名第一的761.eth，现在持有1180个nft，低买高卖的nft数量为95个，近7天有113次交易记录。\n\n![11](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M5OOMXR5pkZI_2WBJJucN.png?height=1718&width=800)\n\n可以点击761.eth进入该地址主页，分析其数据。如下图，卖出的回报率return为125.59%，卖出利润profits为178.81，fliprate为72.3%，这个数据不算高。现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为486，现在持有的nft总买入成本为479，486/479=1.014，这个比值蛮低的，代表最近该地址操作的不是太好。下方就是该地址都持有哪些nft，以及该地址的买入卖出和mint行为。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nmvB6y2FVx5GeSKcm7z4W.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**再点击top whale>rank>return，进入按照30天卖出nft的回报率排名的巨鲸地址页面**。\n\n如下图，近30天回报率排名第一的是sina.eth这个地址，现在持有392个nft，近30天回报率1438倍，现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为1121个eth。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zXDjXHcBtPzhiw4qFzZQN.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**点击sina.eth，可以进入该地址的数据分析页面。卖出的nft回报率为35.6倍，利润绝对值为113个eth，胜率为90%。再看现在持有的nft除以买入总成本的比值，也很大，所以这个地址值得关注**。\n\n![14](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MP6mIbynF-_8brIHDzDMP.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**同样的，排名第三的地址也值得关注，但是最好去看下该地址价值最大的nft的组成。如果所有回报率都是早期持有bayc带来的，最近的交易记录反倒是亏损，就不太值得关注。**\n\n![15](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oNJIjuIs2CZAkwm-fPH1.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n### 2，collections：watchlist-观察列表，nextbluechip-下一个蓝筹项目，whalefomo-巨鲸在买啥\n\n点击下方菜单栏的collections按钮，如果你关注了某个项目，观察列表就会出现这些项目，可以看到总交易量，现在地板价，以及地板价相比前一天的涨幅。下图中可以看到，it’s nothing 以及 moonrunners 都在一天中涨了3倍。\n\n![16](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RBaxID40sPgIzmdCekmc8.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击nextbluechip，分别有1天，3天，7天的蓝筹指数变化情况。\n\n![17](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjHpeDct8D36KeEQyjp-t.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击whale fomo就是按照不同时间，有多少数量的巨鲸买入了多少数量的nft。moonrunners总量1万张，过去6小时，有44个巨鲸买入了56张。\n\n![18](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7E7nvl_2N4kuPL5twiRC-.png?height=1712&width=794)\n\n至于个人资料页面，就是你关注了什么项目，你关注的人的列表，还有你自己地址持有的nft，交易记录等。**因为没有集成x2y2，所以这个交易记录是不准确的，比如我是买了9个serious investor,这里只显示买了4个**。\n\n![19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pMZWXYhTuamF8Bzl28kWD.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n## 三，如何使用NFTtrack，心得体会\n\n1，首先当然是collections菜单栏的whale fomo值得关注，如果一个nft项目，有超过5个whale在集中大量购买，就要引起注意。如果买入的whale超过了100个地址，就要仔细分析是不是已经fomo到顶点了。一般来说，地板价和蓝筹指数随着whale fomo买入，都在不断抬升，就要引起注意。但是如果一天内地板价涨幅过高，比如超过3倍，也要小心你跟着买入是接盘侠，这个时候就要用到之前提到的nft 项目的判断模型。\n\n[bluestarpin.eth📜,📜+X2Y2 on Twitter: \"1，大势，团队，社区，赋能，数据分析。这5个点，是我总结下来判断NFT的一个框架。接下来分别说一说。 / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/lanxing4/status/1525086704079544320?s=20&t=D0EP3W8aRurILRDXmAk5hQ)\n\n2，其次是collections菜单栏的nextbluechip的蓝筹变化指数也值得关注。一个项目的蓝筹指数从0到30%的变化过程，往往伴随着地板价的大幅拉升。\n\n3，然后就是top whale菜单栏的rank页面的return的排名，可以发现一些值得关注的巨鲸地址。此处蓝星建议nfttrack开发地址的nft价值构成分析。我需要知道一个地址现在持有的nft的金额构成，以及回报率是哪些项目占据主导的。如果一个地址只是靠几笔交易获得了大的回报，那么这个地址的胜率就不是太好。就是要关注高胜率，高回报的地址，并且是最近30天也要有交易的，然后一定要跟自己的资金体量差不多的，毕竟适合自己的才是重要的。另外，推特粉丝太多的地址可以加入观察列表，但是不能全信，因为推特粉丝多，很多地址都是自己的小号，主力地址是被隐藏的。该地址的回报是有大量交易做支撑的，且资金体量跟你自己的差多，过去30天低买高卖的胜率超过85%，那么就值得关注。个人建议关注的地址要少而精，不要超过10个地址。关注地址列表也要不断的去芜存菁，根据你观察的胜率和回报率进行不断更新。\n\n## 四，聪明钱钱包地址\n\nNFTTrack团队从后台数据给了我两份地址清单\n\n### 值得关注的蓝筹地址清单\n\nsina.eth,[https://twitter.com/sina_eth_,

The book has sold over one million copies and has been translated into seventeen languages. The revised edition includes updated commentary by noted financial journalist Jason Zweig, whose perspective incorporates the realities of today's market. In this three paragraph essay I will discuss why this book is so highly acclaimed and what you can learn from it.\n\nThe Intelligent Investor is a comprehensive guide to stock market investing that covers topics such as diversification, value investing, and margin buying. Graham's philosophy of \"value investing\" shields investors from substantial error and teaches them to develop long-term strategies; something that has been proven wise time and again given the volatility of the stock market. What makes this book so valuable for modern investors is not only its timeless wisdom but also Jason Zweig's insightful commentary which provides parallels between Graham's examples and today's financial headlines. \n \n\nThe Intelligent Investor is a must read for anyone looking to invest in the stock market. Here are 10 reasons why:\n\n1. The book provides an overview of the stock market and how it works.\n2. It teaches you how to value stocks and make informed investment decisions.\n3. The book offers sound advice on when to buy and sell stocks.\n4. It provides a wealth of information on different types of investments, including bonds, mutual funds, and real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n5. The Intelligent Investor teaches you how to protect your portfolio from risk factors such as inflation and interest rates fluctuations .\n   6 .The book includes detailed instructions on constructing a well-diversified portfolio that meets your specific needs .  7 .It offers practical tips for rebalancing your portfolio regularly 8) The Intelligent Investor discusses important behavioral finance concepts that every investor should be aware of 9)The book has been updated over time to reflect current market conditions 10 )Ultimately, the goal of reading The Intelligent Investor is to help you become a more successful investor", "timestamp": 1656082646, "digest": "KEYo0iylihc_q7IbZ4vHA03ijuhs3de-6N_4HQITxlQ", "contributor": "0xaAFc32040657d33F317544Aaf0F1281D83bC4DEB"}

一，NFTTrack的简单介绍\n\n一句话介绍蓝星对于nfttrack的定义：一个通过数据分析，追踪高胜率高回报地址的nft工具。\n\n推特：<https://twitter.com/NFTTrack> ，1.46万关注。\n\ndiscord：<https://discord.gg/28GA48hnmm> ，1430人。\n\n官方使用帮助手册：\n\n[🎒 NFTTrack Handbook](https://mirror.xyz/nfttrack.eth/6T-4NjVH0m0k3wfpTUbd_SPSvURz2nQp8L4qfu8g9JI)\n\n现在NFTTrack只有手机端，网页端也在计划之中，安卓和苹果手机都可以在应用商店搜索nfttrack下载到，苹果手机不需要国外苹果id就可以下载到。\n\n## 二,NFTtrack的功能介绍\n\n建议打开梯子来使用NFTTtrack，否则只能体验到一部分功能。\n\n下载好之后，打开手机，就会出现discover页面。\n\n![1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ruHknvr2ipjxKSGuTdmr0.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n先点击右下角的me，连接钱包，此处蓝星选择连接的是小狐狸钱包。可以看到，如果你的地址跟推特关联了，会自动显示你的推特名称。\n\n![2](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qF8DYbgZX-C0q947KExqL.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**下方有三个主菜单按钮，分别是巨鲸-top whale ，收藏品-collections，个人资料-me .**\n\n### 1, 巨鲸 top whale页面：following ,  discover,  rank\n\n**following 关注页面**\n\n点击左下角的top whale，再点击following，钱包签名以及推特授权之后，就可以看到下图，展示了你追踪的地址的交易记录，他们买了哪些nft，卖出了哪些nft ，mint了哪些nft。\n\n![3](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3yI3Lmp0eFP47GIhpJVj7.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**蓝星建议：卖出这里，如果能够加上当时买入价格或者mint 价格为多少，数量为多少，赚了多少，回报比多少，持有多长时间，就更好了。现在只是简单列出卖出收到了多少eth，了解不了更详细的信息**。\n\n![4](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I3gw9ltXVQFUjKy5yDdFC.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**discover探索页面**\n\n探索页面，主要聚焦于巨鲸现在的交易行为。分为whalefomo, 以及whales activity。\n\n![5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SqDqPVYugmNnEjQyTRJKg.png?height=1722&width=792)\n\n点击whalefomo右边的more，会跳转到收藏品collections页面的whalefomo页面，可以查看不同时间段巨鲸们都在买卖什么样的nft。比如下图，有3个巨鲸在1个小时前购买了31只spunmonkes，总交易量14.62，平均价格为0.0153，现在的地板价为0.0048。\n\n![6](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5Z61xwzfZN-ko-QylTBEU.png?height=1644&width=794)\n\n点击spunmonkes,可以查看该项目的一些数据情况，比如地板价变化趋势，蓝筹指数，持有地址，手机端也集成了opensea, gem, looksrare，项目推特以及项目官网。\n\n**蓝星建议：应当集成x2y2，现在很多新项目，x2y2的交易量都是第二的。作为一个nft工具，不集成市场份额第二的nft交易平台X2Y2 ，感觉有点奇怪，并且X2Y2 的手续费只是0.5%，相比其他平台，可以为玩家节省蛮多费用**。\n\n![7](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ts30KJksNflWjjjEACCQK.png?height=1736&width=796)\n\n下方还有筹码分布，持有该项目的地址都持有哪些蓝筹项目，该项目的交易记录，上架数量等信息。\n\n**蓝星注：此处当然是筹码越分散，买的巨鲸地址越多，蓝筹指数不断增高，上架数量越少更好**。\n\n![8](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JUw1kOzCTrx-xSJW4Em2S.png?height=1676&width=788)\n\n回到topwhale的discover页面\n\n![9](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ePxNQBmirYF6GID_ERPV_.png?height=1720&width=808)\n\n点击hiten.eth，跳转到下图，有关于该巨鲸的数据，卖出排名，巨鲸排名，推特多少粉丝。\n\n![10](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/esrEUlMX8_SZ2B3tGPYgh.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n其中fliprate#4指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖的排名。\n\nwhale#503指：一段时间内该地址所有nft价值的排名。\n\nreturn指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报率。\n\nprofits指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报绝对值。\n\nfliprate指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖占所有交易次数的比率，蓝星这里理解为胜率。\n\ntotal floor value指：该地址现在持有的nft按照地板价计算的总eth价值。\n\ntotal cost指：该地址现在持有的nft当时买入的总成本。\n\nnfts指：该地址现在持有的nft总数量。\n\n显然，关注的指标，return 以及fliprate，还有total floor value/ total cost的比值应当越大越好，代表该地址的历史表现更好，该地址更值得关注。\n\nwhalefomo这里重点关注买入某个nft的巨鲸数量和买入卖出数量。\n\n**再点击rank，来到巨鲸排名页面，在这里可以发现很多值得关注的巨鲸地址，可以关注他们，追踪他们的交易记录，做追随策略**。\n\n如下图，胜率排名第一的761.eth，现在持有1180个nft，低买高卖的nft数量为95个，近7天有113次交易记录。\n\n![11](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M5OOMXR5pkZI_2WBJJucN.png?height=1718&width=800)\n\n可以点击761.eth进入该地址主页，分析其数据。如下图，卖出的回报率return为125.59%，卖出利润profits为178.81，fliprate为72.3%，这个数据不算高。现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为486，现在持有的nft总买入成本为479，486/479=1.014，这个比值蛮低的，代表最近该地址操作的不是太好。下方就是该地址都持有哪些nft，以及该地址的买入卖出和mint行为。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nmvB6y2FVx5GeSKcm7z4W.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**再点击top whale>rank>return，进入按照30天卖出nft的回报率排名的巨鲸地址页面**。\n\n如下图，近30天回报率排名第一的是sina.eth这个地址，现在持有392个nft，近30天回报率1438倍，现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为1121个eth。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zXDjXHcBtPzhiw4qFzZQN.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**点击sina.eth，可以进入该地址的数据分析页面。卖出的nft回报率为35.6倍，利润绝对值为113个eth，胜率为90%。再看现在持有的nft除以买入总成本的比值，也很大，所以这个地址值得关注**。\n\n![14](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MP6mIbynF-_8brIHDzDMP.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**同样的，排名第三的地址也值得关注，但是最好去看下该地址价值最大的nft的组成。如果所有回报率都是早期持有bayc带来的，最近的交易记录反倒是亏损，就不太值得关注。**\n\n![15](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oNJIjuIs2CZAkwm-fPH1.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n### 2，collections：watchlist-观察列表，nextbluechip-下一个蓝筹项目，whalefomo-巨鲸在买啥\n\n点击下方菜单栏的collections按钮，如果你关注了某个项目，观察列表就会出现这些项目，可以看到总交易量，现在地板价，以及地板价相比前一天的涨幅。下图中可以看到，it’s nothing 以及 moonrunners 都在一天中涨了3倍。\n\n![16](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RBaxID40sPgIzmdCekmc8.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击nextbluechip，分别有1天，3天，7天的蓝筹指数变化情况。\n\n![17](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjHpeDct8D36KeEQyjp-t.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击whale fomo就是按照不同时间，有多少数量的巨鲸买入了多少数量的nft。moonrunners总量1万张，过去6小时，有44个巨鲸买入了56张。\n\n![18](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7E7nvl_2N4kuPL5twiRC-.png?height=1712&width=794)\n\n至于个人资料页面，就是你关注了什么项目，你关注的人的列表，还有你自己地址持有的nft，交易记录等。**因为没有集成x2y2，所以这个交易记录是不准确的，比如我是买了9个serious investor,这里只显示买了4个**。\n\n![19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pMZWXYhTuamF8Bzl28kWD.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n## 三，如何使用NFTtrack，心得体会\n\n1，首先当然是collections菜单栏的whale fomo值得关注，如果一个nft项目，有超过5个whale在集中大量购买，就要引起注意。如果买入的whale超过了100个地址，就要仔细分析是不是已经fomo到顶点了。一般来说，地板价和蓝筹指数随着whale fomo买入，都在不断抬升，就要引起注意。但是如果一天内地板价涨幅过高，比如超过3倍，也要小心你跟着买入是接盘侠，这个时候就要用到之前提到的nft 项目的判断模型。\n\n[bluestarpin.eth📜,📜+X2Y2 on Twitter: \"1，大势，团队，社区，赋能，数据分析。这5个点，是我总结下来判断NFT的一个框架。接下来分别说一说。 / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/lanxing4/status/1525086704079544320?s=20&t=D0EP3W8aRurILRDXmAk5hQ)\n\n2，其次是collections菜单栏的nextbluechip的蓝筹变化指数也值得关注。一个项目的蓝筹指数从0到30%的变化过程，往往伴随着地板价的大幅拉升。\n\n3，然后就是top whale菜单栏的rank页面的return的排名，可以发现一些值得关注的巨鲸地址。此处蓝星建议nfttrack开发地址的nft价值构成分析。我需要知道一个地址现在持有的nft的金额构成，以及回报率是哪些项目占据主导的。如果一个地址只是靠几笔交易获得了大的回报，那么这个地址的胜率就不是太好。就是要关注高胜率，高回报的地址，并且是最近30天也要有交易的，然后一定要跟自己的资金体量差不多的，毕竟适合自己的才是重要的。另外，推特粉丝太多的地址可以加入观察列表，但是不能全信，因为推特粉丝多，很多地址都是自己的小号，主力地址是被隐藏的。该地址的回报是有大量交易做支撑的，且资金体量跟你自己的差多，过去30天低买高卖的胜率超过85%，那么就值得关注。个人建议关注的地址要少而精，不要超过10个地址。关注地址列表也要不断的去芜存菁，根据你观察的胜率和回报率进行不断更新。\n\n##

It is only focused on integrity and authentication. Both goals form the backbone for decentralization as it allows anyone to verify: \n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nWe call this property *public verifiability* as anyone can fetch the data from an untrusted source and check if the relevant computation was performed correctly.

A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity. They can compute the credentials (public-private key pair) locally on their machine. The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer. A signature is timeless and it can be verified at any point in time. In fact, we can check all historical transactions in a network like Bitcoin and verify the signer was indeed authorised to spend the coins.\n\nWhat about zero knowledge proofs?", "timestamp": 1656082790, "digest": "a4Y0TrLL7BcS8rarDfDVQW6HJKSTydm5K7u2sEqC2wA", "contributor": "0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5"}

{"id": "MstGQK-PD9AfQlj1a58TTtrc3vx6T4TBRAsYpalCyV8", "title": "The \"crypto\" in cryptocurrency", "body": "The word “crypto” may spark images in your mind of ciphers, code breaking and even Bletchley park’s involvement in World War 2. I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). From his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. The idea that information wants to find its way into every nook and cranny does have consequences (for the better or worse). For example, information leaks can help us learn about atrocities committed by government, but it can also be used by the government for surveillance of its citizens. \n\nCryptography is a tool that enables us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. It has similarities to the perspective of David vs Goliath as cryptography is one of the only tools that allows a citizen to successfully fend against a nation state actor. In fact, for most of cryptography’s history, it is a tool that allows the defender to protect itself from an all-powerful adversary. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA protocol designed using cryptography tends to have three goals: \n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is not concerned with confidentiality. It is only focused on integrity and authentication. Both goals form the backbone for decentralization as it allows anyone to verify: \n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nWe call this property *public verifiability* as anyone can fetch the data from an untrusted source and check if the relevant computation was performed correctly. This property is crucial to protect coins held by users on the network. If the public cannot get access to the data or lacks a mechanism to check whether it is correct, then it is a trusted system.\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\n**Not an anonymous currency.** Many people find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange at first. I suspect this is the case because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use in the dark web. The very name *crypto*currency leads to that misunderstanding. Unfortunately for criminals, they are the most traceable currencies in the world and it is a really bad tool for their desired purpose. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose.\n\n**Privacy-coins do exist.** Confidentiality of financial transactions on a global scale is a sought-after feature. A number of systems exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. is a sought-after property and there are a number of systems with strong confidentiality including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. I believe this frontier of research and development is essential for the continued growth of decentralised finance (DeFi).\n\nA fun project is to list the existing DeFI applications and identify which aspects can benefit from financial privacy. But for now, we do not concern ourselves with confidentiality. It is not needed to understand how cryptography is immediately used in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThe cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is basic. There are only two primitives to consider. A commitment scheme to protect the integrity of the blockchain and digital signatures to authenticate actions from an end-user. We have put together dedicated articles for both primitives and in this article we provide a brief explanation of each.\n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature.

二,NFTtrack的功能介绍\n\n建议打开梯子来使用NFTTtrack，否则只能体验到一部分功能。\n\n下载好之后，打开手机，就会出现discover页面。\n\n![1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ruHknvr2ipjxKSGuTdmr0.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n先点击右下角的me，连接钱包，此处蓝星选择连接的是小狐狸钱包。可以看到，如果你的地址跟推特关联了，会自动显示你的推特名称。\n\n![2](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qF8DYbgZX-C0q947KExqL.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**下方有三个主菜单按钮，分别是巨鲸-top whale ，收藏品-collections，个人资料-me .**\n\n### 1, 巨鲸 top whale页面：following ,  discover,  rank\n\n**following 关注页面**\n\n点击左下角的top whale，再点击following，钱包签名以及推特授权之后，就可以看到下图，展示了你追踪的地址的交易记录，他们买了哪些nft，卖出了哪些nft

以及whales activity。\n\n![5](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SqDqPVYugmNnEjQyTRJKg.png?height=1722&width=792)\n\n点击whalefomo右边的more，会跳转到收藏品collections页面的whalefomo页面，可以查看不同时间段巨鲸们都在买卖什么样的nft。比如下图，有3个巨鲸在1个小时前购买了31只spunmonkes，总交易量14.62，平均价格为0.0153，现在的地板价为0.0048。\n\n![6](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5Z61xwzfZN-ko-QylTBEU.png?height=1644&width=794)\n\n点击spunmonkes,可以查看该项目的一些数据情况，比如地板价变化趋势，蓝筹指数，持有地址，手机端也集成了opensea, gem, looksrare，项目推特以及项目官网。\n\n**蓝星建议：应当集成x2y2，现在很多新项目，x2y2的交易量都是第二的。作为一个nft工具，不集成市场份额第二的nft交易平台X2Y2 ，感觉有点奇怪，并且X2Y2 的手续费只是0.5%，相比其他平台，可以为玩家节省蛮多费用**。\n\n![7](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ts30KJksNflWjjjEACCQK.png?height=1736&width=796)\n\n下方还有筹码分布，持有该项目的地址都持有哪些蓝筹项目，该项目的交易记录，上架数量等信息。\n\n**蓝星注：此处当然是筹码越分散，买的巨鲸地址越多，蓝筹指数不断增高，上架数量越少更好**。\n\n![8](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JUw1kOzCTrx-xSJW4Em2S.png?height=1676&width=788)\n\n回到topwhale的discover页面\n\n![9](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ePxNQBmirYF6GID_ERPV_.png?height=1720&width=808)\n\n点击hiten.eth，跳转到下图，有关于该巨鲸的数据，卖出排名，巨鲸排名，推特多少粉丝。\n\n![10](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/esrEUlMX8_SZ2B3tGPYgh.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n其中fliprate#4指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖的排名。\n\nwhale#503指：一段时间内该地址所有nft价值的排名。\n\nreturn指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报率。\n\nprofits指：该地址卖出去的nft的回报绝对值。\n\nfliprate指：一段时间内该地址低买高卖占所有交易次数的比率，蓝星这里理解为胜率。\n\ntotal floor value指：该地址现在持有的nft按照地板价计算的总eth价值。\n\ntotal cost指：该地址现在持有的nft当时买入的总成本。\n\nnfts指：该地址现在持有的nft总数量。\n\n显然，关注的指标，return 以及fliprate，还有total floor value/ total cost的比值应当越大越好，代表该地址的历史表现更好，该地址更值得关注。\n\nwhalefomo这里重点关注买入某个nft的巨鲸数量和买入卖出数量。\n\n**再点击rank，来到巨鲸排名页面，在这里可以发现很多值得关注的巨鲸地址，可以关注他们，追踪他们的交易记录，做追随策略**。\n\n如下图，胜率排名第一的761.eth，现在持有1180个nft，低买高卖的nft数量为95个，近7天有113次交易记录。\n\n![11](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M5OOMXR5pkZI_2WBJJucN.png?height=1718&width=800)\n\n可以点击761.eth进入该地址主页，分析其数据。如下图，卖出的回报率return为125.59%，卖出利润profits为178.81，fliprate为72.3%，这个数据不算高。现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为486，现在持有的nft总买入成本为479，486/479=1.014，这个比值蛮低的，代表最近该地址操作的不是太好。下方就是该地址都持有哪些nft，以及该地址的买入卖出和mint行为。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nmvB6y2FVx5GeSKcm7z4W.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**再点击top whale>rank>return，进入按照30天卖出nft的回报率排名的巨鲸地址页面**。\n\n如下图，近30天回报率排名第一的是sina.eth这个地址，现在持有392个nft，近30天回报率1438倍，现在持有的nft按照地板价计算为1121个eth。\n\n![13](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zXDjXHcBtPzhiw4qFzZQN.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**点击sina.eth，可以进入该地址的数据分析页面。卖出的nft回报率为35.6倍，利润绝对值为113个eth，胜率为90%。再看现在持有的nft除以买入总成本的比值，也很大，所以这个地址值得关注**。\n\n![14](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MP6mIbynF-_8brIHDzDMP.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n**同样的，排名第三的地址也值得关注，但是最好去看下该地址价值最大的nft的组成。如果所有回报率都是早期持有bayc带来的，最近的交易记录反倒是亏损，就不太值得关注。**\n\n![15](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1oNJIjuIs2CZAkwm-fPH1.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n### 2，collections：watchlist-观察列表，nextbluechip-下一个蓝筹项目，whalefomo-巨鲸在买啥\n\n点击下方菜单栏的collections按钮，如果你关注了某个项目，观察列表就会出现这些项目，可以看到总交易量，现在地板价，以及地板价相比前一天的涨幅。下图中可以看到，it’s nothing 以及 moonrunners 都在一天中涨了3倍。\n\n![16](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RBaxID40sPgIzmdCekmc8.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击nextbluechip，分别有1天，3天，7天的蓝筹指数变化情况。\n\n![17](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjHpeDct8D36KeEQyjp-t.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n再点击whale fomo就是按照不同时间，有多少数量的巨鲸买入了多少数量的nft。moonrunners总量1万张，过去6小时，有44个巨鲸买入了56张。\n\n![18](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7E7nvl_2N4kuPL5twiRC-.png?height=1712&width=794)\n\n至于个人资料页面，就是你关注了什么项目，你关注的人的列表，还有你自己地址持有的nft，交易记录等。**因为没有集成x2y2，所以这个交易记录是不准确的，比如我是买了9个serious investor,这里只显示买了4个**。\n\n![19](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pMZWXYhTuamF8Bzl28kWD.png?height=2532&width=1170)\n\n## 三，如何使用NFTtrack，心得体会\n\n1，首先当然是collections菜单栏的whale fomo值得关注，如果一个nft项目，有超过5个whale在集中大量购买，就要引起注意。如果买入的whale超过了100个地址，就要仔细分析是不是已经fomo到顶点了。一般来说，地板价和蓝筹指数随着whale fomo买入，都在不断抬升，就要引起注意。但是如果一天内地板价涨幅过高，比如超过3倍，也要小心你跟着买入是接盘侠，这个时候就要用到之前提到的nft 项目的判断模型。\n\n[bluestarpin.eth📜,📜+X2Y2 on Twitter: \"1，大势，团队，社区，赋能，数据分析。这5个点，是我总结下来判断NFT的一个框架。接下来分别说一说。 / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/lanxing4/status/1525086704079544320?s=20&t=D0EP3W8aRurILRDXmAk5hQ)\n\n2，其次是collections菜单栏的nextbluechip的蓝筹变化指数也值得关注。一个项目的蓝筹指数从0到30%的变化过程，往往伴随着地板价的大幅拉升。\n\n3，然后就是top whale菜单栏的rank页面的return的排名，可以发现一些值得关注的巨鲸地址。此处蓝星建议nfttrack开发地址的nft价值构成分析。我需要知道一个地址现在持有的nft的金额构成，以及回报率是哪些项目占据主导的。如果一个地址只是靠几笔交易获得了大的回报，那么这个地址的胜率就不是太好。就是要关注高胜率，高回报的地址，并且是最近30天也要有交易的，然后一定要跟自己的资金体量差不多的，毕竟适合自己的才是重要的。另外，推特粉丝太多的地址可以加入观察列表，但是不能全信，因为推特粉丝多，很多地址都是自己的小号，主力地址是被隐藏的。该地址的回报是有大量交易做支撑的，且资金体量跟你自己的差多，过去30天低买高卖的胜率超过85%，那么就值得关注。个人建议关注的地址要少而精，不要超过10个地址。关注地址列表也要不断的去芜存菁，根据你观察的胜率和回报率进行不断更新。\n\n##

The DAO’s organizational structure naturally removes organizational barriers to decentralized asset management. Enzyme, a pioneer of multi-chain asset management protocols, was created in 2016. More importantly, it can use tokens to incentivise asset issuers and liquidity participants to tap into more decentralized financial scenarios.\n\nFrom flatter investment decision-making systems, to incentives to participate in product beta versions, to the formation of vast armies of capital in the upcoming metaverse. These new tools will be a force to be reckoned with once the asset management protocol has achieved the integration of tokens with the community.\n\nEnzyme allows users to make speculative bets using liquid assets. With the development of decentralized asset management protocols and the emergence of new ways to interact with the “X-to-earn” social paradigm beyond DeFi boundaries, we can expect to see an influx of user demand for such tokens.\n\nNew players are entering the new management game.\n\n## Decentralized asset management: an attempt to return to classical equilibrium\n\nDue to the nature of centralization and barriers, traditional asset management is a high-cost and high-friction industry. The core of decentralized asset management is to optimize the traditional asset management process.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*j8yfKo1c9dmnsVoV)\n\n*source: coingecko*\n\n### 1/ 9 advantages of decentralized asset management\n\nDecentralized asset management utilizing blockchain and smart contract technology has the following advantages:\n\n\\*\\*1. Effectively reducing start-up costs. \\*\\*This is arguably the most important and immediate improvement. In traditional finance, creating a fund requires high compliance, registration and notarization fees. But the cost of starting a fund on a blockchain is low.\n\n\\*\\*2. Greatly shorten the startup time. \\*\\*The traditional fund creation process can take months. The decentralized alternative only takes a few minutes.\n\n\\*\\*3.Anyone can be a fund manager. \\*\\*Blockchains and smart contracts allow anyone with a computer to build their own investment vehicles.\n\n\\*\\*4.Anyone can be a fund investor. \\*\\*Top fund investment opportunities are limited to qualified investors with net assets of several million dollars, while decentralized asset management does not limit the size of funds.\n\n\\*\\*5. Strictly enforced terms of authorization. \\*\\*Traditional fund rules and licensing agreements are often enforced subjectively by fund managers and can still be broken at their discretion. Blockchain-based funds can make rules strictly algorithmic, leaving fund managers with no choice but to follow predefined rules.\n\n\\*\\*6. Based on the principle of untrusteeship/no trust. \\*\\*In blockchain-based funds, fund managers do not have the right to trust or withdraw investors’ money, but can only use it to execute certain investments.\n\n\\*\\*7. More liquidity. \\*\\*Most traditional fund redemptions are usually quarterly. Blockchain-based funds can greatly increase investor liquidity, and protocols can allow instant redemption depending on the actual state of the fund’s position on the chain.\n\n\\*\\*8. Transparency. \\*\\*Foundations in the traditional asset management world are often closed and relatively opaque because of their reliance on real-life contracts, external auditors and non-real-time reporting. A fund built on blockchain is completely transparent, with all changes in its portfolio updated in real time.\n\n\\*\\*9. Composability. \\*\\*Decentralized finance has evolved into a set of interconnected and modular monetary Legos. This allows decentralized asset management to easily plug into other DeFi services for trading, extending leverage, insurance, swaps and other product capabilities. That gives investors more choice\n\n### 2/ The appeal of active on-chain money management\n\nAsset management in DeFi can be divided into the following three categories:\n\n1\\. Active on-chain fund management (active management)\n\n2\\. Index products and basket currencies (passively managed)\n\n3\\. Structured products and vault based products\n\nThis paper deals only with the field of active on-chain fund management. Historically, actively managed funds have generally outperformed passive basket indices, or DPI indices. Actively managed funds tend to do better in downturns. Of course, passive asset management protocols usually have advantages in attracting capital, but in maintaining the efficiency of capital operation, they often encounter the problem of liquidity disloyalty, which can only be overcome by the unsustainable way of high-yield mining.\n\nMotivating teams and users to develop high-yield Alpha strategies is an issue that needs to be considered in every asset management agreement, regardless of type. But with passive asset management protocols, the big returns are often available only to a few. This can lead to a long time gap between protocol product development and capital strategy execution. Active funds, by contrast, can change strategies and compete for capital more quickly because of the large number of managers and often only need to capture high-return speculative assets and trade in secondary markets.\n\nOf course, the discretion of asset management protocols is also a double-edged sword. High yields may be a moat for passive management protocols, but robustness and diversification are preferred for active management protocols. Ongoing policy maintenance and optimization is a good starting point for socializing. Recent large-scale DeFi liquidations have proven that agreements that are divorced from communities and violate the principle of decentralization cannot ensure capital efficiency.\n\n## A difficult attempt to socialize asset management\n\n### 1/Cater to the personalized needs of crypto users\n\nOn-chain asset management ensures that investors have no trust in the custody of capital. Transparent ledgers reduce the cost burden of complex accounting and auditing. At the same time, DeFi’s permitless access provides users with open access rights. This means that the cost of launching a hedge fund in the blockchain world is limited to a small amount of Gas fees.\n\nHowever, the TVL of decentralized asset management protocols is small. Why hasn’t something with such high product fit expanded rapidly so far? The main thing is that the space is still getting more social traction. While this segment of the market may be immature relative to other DeFi products, its acceptance so far has been very encouraging.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*wZZaZxYBHowzDo5n)\n\n*source: Enzyme*\n\nCryptographic native protocols are building a toolkit for decentralized money management in a variety of ways. We may see crypto-native asset management protocols become popular before more mainstream traditional institutions take action. Social tokens allow users to make interesting trades on speculative assets. These on-chain assets are traded based on individual needs in a decentralized asset management approach.\n\nWeb3.0 and crypto native tokens may not simply be a one-to-one copy of TradFi onto the blockchain. While cost reduction is important, it is mechanism design and the development of unique products based on smart contracts that are likely to attract users. Unfortunately, innovative decentralized asset management infrastructures often have little to offer in terms of innovative mechanisms.\n\n### 2/ Why hasn’t there been a pandemic?\n\nThe asset management habits of crypto users are often fast-paced, which conflicts with the long-cycle nature of asset management. A step-by-step strategy is clearly unacceptable to users in an area characterized by the highest volatility. So highly leveraged crypto derivatives tend to be more popular. How the asset management protocol provides these policies and scenarios to users with low risk is very important. Note that I said low-risk offering, not low-risk creating profit.\n\nFor actively managed funds, it takes years of continuous management to have a chance of producing long-term average returns. For fund managers, the process is also relatively long. The cost of trust is higher than the copy trading function of a centralized exchange. So how asset management protocols ensure that users build trust in the face of these long turnaround periods is also important. So far, vault design and community fund rewards are viable mechanisms.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*sdqKbNItcSFVsGyR)\n\n*source: Token Terminal*\n\nIn addition, DeFi users tend to prefer the feeling of being in control of their money, and some good fund managers may not necessarily like full exposure to the chain portfolio. This prevents the agreement from attracting higher-quality fund managers and a larger number of DeFi users.\n\nHow to bridge the boundaries between privacy and initiative is important. Instant redemption, users’ rights to portfolio assets and the empowerment of managers’ equity are also important. From this point of view, investment kols with their own community attributes tend to be the priority of decentralized asset management protocols, while social tokens and NFT have obvious advantages in increasing tool availability and user asset flow.\n\n## Enzyme: Eliminate capital waste and welcome social return\n\n### 1/Integrate protocols and portfolio assets to improve capital efficiency\n\nEnzyme is a modification of Melon Protocol. They released version V4 this year, which has a lot of innovation beyond basic features like decentralized lending, AMM pools, and agricultural capabilities. Fund managers have access to a large number of functions outside the protocol. This protocol integrates Polygon, Uniswap V3, Opyn, Compound, Aave and other protocols.\n\nAt the same time, Gas Relayer’s new features allow asset managers to eliminate the high ethereum Gas fee burden and redefine the cost of the entire vault. To fully understand how this works, as well as its implications and best practices, we will soon be Posting a blog covering this.\n\nV4 allows users to customize the token/ticker symbol and customize around the user’s brand identity. Users can also transfer shares to new investors without redemption. This creates a secondary market for the user’s Treasury stock, which gives it the opportunity to trade. Users can invest in more than 200 assets here. The platform also enables organizations to run their own investment funds using Gnosis multi-signature wallets.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*MlO7nAiNukplj6sA)\n\n*source: Enzyme*\n\nEnzyme solves the problem of capital inefficiencies by integrating deployment with multiple protocols. Increase the availability of the agreement by borrowing and escrow assets. So Enzyme is definitely on the move when it comes to making broader gains. The allocation and use of idle assets to obtain immediate income increases the source of liquidity and income options. Better use of idle assets and LP tokens is an important reason why Enzyme is ahead.\n\n### 2/The key to winning: Personalized social investing trends\n\nEnzyme’s own Treasury creates a personalized vault, while users can easily copy on-chain policies. These designs greatly enhance users’ social security and freedom. Enzyme also improves security and depositor protection through a 7-day review period.\n\nV4 introduced a protocol fee for this protocol. The fee is a tax on the amount of assets under management in each vault. This is calculated continuously with respect to the annualized target percentage and results in the automatic casting of a certain number of additional shares for each vault and allocation to the agreement itself. The agreement uses a repo mechanism to force fund managers to demand MLN tokens. In addition, the burning of the MLN used for buybacks creates deflationary pressures on tokens.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\*H6fCbtAAozyf-AQX)\n\n*source: DefiLlama*\n\nIn traditional finance, investing in hedge funds can be difficult for the average person. Launching hedge funds could be harder. Enzyme simplified and innovated the fund launch process, and the openness of the network they built in addition to improving transparency, democratized access for all investors. After years of development, Enzyme’s TVL hovers around $30 million.\n\nWe think Enzyme should pursue more social attempts to monetize smart elitist investment management. For investors, Enzyme lowers barriers to entry and improves transparency. As long as the Enzyme protocol continues to integrate and expand the scope of assets and focus on optimizing the long-term direction of composable financial instruments, the investability of assets across the chain will continue to increase.\n\nEven during bear markets, asset management protocols should consider a profit strategy on the downside. Fund managers can hold stablecoin assets and avoid the downward trend in profits. On this basis, how to create more investment options for users in a falling market is the problem to consider. For the two core stakeholders, it is only a matter of time before AUM rises in the future, as long as their enthusiasm can be stimulated.", "timestamp": 1656083116, "digest": "2a0GYBhiBG9Wp85mV0UVSxBJ9OZwaFDa5vvOopTZe04", "contributor": "0x867A3f354c0eCB6622aEf1bF14C3BE79338AD889"}

Asset prices globally are down and inflation is up. Some DAOs, such as [1Hive](https://twitter.com/Paul_Glavin/status/1537824747714748416), were able to utilize diversification strategies during the peak of last cycle to convert their native tokens to stable coins, to build up that emergency runway, but most did not. It has never been more apparent of how important diversification is. It may seem like there is nothing left to do, because selling tokens at these prices may only further exacerbate the problems and put additional sell pressure on token prices, especially when buyers are becoming more scarce until things settle down. However, I believe there is still one great option to deploy native DAO tokens to earn yield and responsibly convert them to stable coins: long dated covered calls.\n\n**Background**: Hedgey Finance launched the ability for any DAO to deploy a covered calls market (pair of token <> usdc), across any EVM. Covered Calls are derivatives, commonly referred to as Options, where the *Seller* of the call is *Selling (and receiving payment for)* the *Right* (for the *Buyer*) to purchase *X* amount of *Tokens* at a specific *Price per token* before a specific *Date*. Simply what this means is that as the seller, I am getting paid up front in USDC, and locking my native tokens in the DeFi protocol where the buyer can purchase those tokens from me at our agreed upon price anytime before the expiration date. When the buyer buys my tokens, referred to as ‘exercising the call’, they pay me  the agreed upon USDC to purchase the tokens. If the call expires (doesn’t get exercised before the expiration date), then I just get my tokens back and can deploy and sell another covered call.\n\nWhile traders may think of covered calls as a strictly day trading strategy, for the DAO<>community relationship, they can be a very powerful tool that does not require constant trading. Rather than a short term speculative toy, selling 3 - 6 month (or longer) dated covered calls has the power to align benefits and incentives of a DAO and its community.\n\n**Good for the DAO:** DAOs would be selling covered calls to 1) earn some yield in USDC on their native tokens today and 2) responsibly and transparently convert those tokens to USDC at a higher price than current market prices at some point in the future. This strategy does a lot of things:\n\n* Creates immediate stable coin liquidity\n* Transparently and responsibly converts tokens to stable coins as price appreciates - at publicly known price levels\n* When converted, builds a real runway of stable coins, generating true diversification of the treasury\n* Builds trust with the community and investors, while also giving them the opportunity to profit\n\n**Good for the community:** On the flip side are the buyers of the covered calls offered by the DAO - the community (and other investors). While many have seen their portfolios suffer recently, buying long dated covered calls is a way for the community to pay significantly less up front to get significantly more leverage on the token appreciation in the future. As an example, lets suppose we are interested in buying 100 of token X, currently priced at $5. We can purchase those tokens for $500. Alternatively, if DAO_X is selling a covered call of 100 tokens, with a strike of $7.5 and premium of $50 we could purchase that instead at 1/10th of the cost. Without getting into the weeds, if the price of X goes to $10, then we’ll have gained 100% on the Hodl strategy but 200% on the options strategy, and if it goes to $15: 200% on the Hodl strategy but a whopping 1,400% on the options strategy. As prices have dropped so swiftly, this is a great opportunity to purchase at a discount - and buying long dated covered call options will render even more opportunity for gains when the next bull market hits.\n\n**Summary: Hedgey’s peer to peer long dated covered call options are an effective tool to build stablecoin runway in a bear market.** Buyers should have the appetite to take advantage of depressed token prices, and purchasing covered calls gives them an even higher upside profit potential. DAOs can utilize the covered calls to generate some runway up front, and responsibly let the community buy tokens at given price points above current market prices (ie no dumping).\n\n*If you are interested as a DAO or community, but need help in understanding how to price the covered calls reasonably and fairly, please join our [discord](https://discord.gg/2wG5jGsBRw) and reach out to @iceman (or @icemanparachute on telegram).*\n\nDisclaimer: This the articles and materials on this site are not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for, financial advise or legal or tax advice, or investment recommendations.

In terms of the question of whether BTC is inflationary or deflationary, some people will say it’s inflationary as there are still 2 million more BTC to be mined, however, there is a max supply cap of 21 million, so in essence, it is actually deflationary as the available supply will be less since miners will be obsolete due to no more BTC available to be mined so the only way to acquire more would be to trade.\n* In terms of utility, BTC has been described as many things, those include a store of value, an alternative to gold; ie. digital gold, it can be used for fast, cheap and permissionless transactions and in terms of resilience it’s proven over time to be a very strong and secure network.\n* Is there a real-world use case?\n  * Store of value, some people have referred to BTC as gold.2 or digital gold\n  * Hedge on inflation, since there is a limited supply\n  * Transactions, fast, cheap & permissionless\n* Who are the whales (who owns the majority of tokens)?\n* Is the distribution spread out or concentrated?\n  * Due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of BTC, it’s difficult to work out how much one entity or person holds, as these can be shared across different wallets.\n  * However, according to [BitInfoCharts](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html), we can firstly see that some of these large holders are cold wallets for large exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, Coincheck, Bittrex, ect.\n  * We can also see that the top 100 wallets hold around 15% of all BTC.\n  * Also we have to take into consideration that larger institutions such as MassMutual, Ruffer Investments, Tesla, GrayScale Bitcoin Trust and Microstrategy to name a few are accumulating more BTC as we speak.\n  * *We should also assume that other financial institutions are moving into the space such as the large banks who thrive from market manipulation, so as they FUD the space, be sure they’re slowly buying.*\n\n## ETH Ξ\n\n* There are 121 million ETH in circulation, there is an infinite ∞ amount of ETH available to be added, so there is no max cap. Similar to BTC, at face value, it seems that ETH is inflationary as there is no max supply cap so an infinite amount could be issued. However thanks to [EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md), ETH has introduced a burning mechanism (ETH being sent to a wallet that no one has access to, therefore removing it from circulation) the asset becomes deflationary as eventually more ETH will be burnt than is issued once the merge happens in 2050 *(a running joke that the merge will forever be in development)*. Using [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money/) you can track the burn, supply growth and issuance and even simulate the issuance (creation/release of new ETH into circulating supply) which as you’ll see ends up being negative so therefore deflationary.\n* In terms of utility, there are several for holding the ETH token & using the Ethereum network:\n  * Transactions, transactions are permissionless\n  * Store of value, with the burning of ETH there is a decreasing supply so you can assume the value would only increase due to scarcity\n  * Staking, you can contribute to the network security & earn rewards for that contribution and time\n    * This staking causes a strong network effect which gives high security due to the size of the network and also high costs to transact meaning an attack large enough or multiple attacks to the network would be incredibly costly without certainty of success.\n  * Build on top of the platform, builders can develop & grow different decentralised applications from DEFI, NFT’s an a bunch of  dapps (decentralised apps) & smart contracts\n* In terms of real-world use case, here are some:\n  * Similar to BTC it’s a store of value, as the supply decreases the scarcity increases so it’s deflationary\n  * Transactions, these are permissionless\n  * People can access these financial tools across DEFI with a level playing field as a pose to the current financial system which allows ~~rich people~~ and accredited investors to access exclusive money-making opportunities\n  * DEFI allows for higher interest rate returns via staking, farming, instant trading and leverage, which obviously has risks but the fact that you can decide for yourself instead of being told yes/no by some obscure person/group is a positive step.\n  * Possibilities for people to make an income from gaming without being sponsored by big organisations with p2e (play to earn)\n  * Jump into the art world which is usually quite exclusive and seen as very exclusive, now there’s an easier way via NFT’s which also offer opportunities to join membership clubs, investment opportunities, the possibilities are endless.\n  * DAO’s, which are decentralised autonomous organisations, as the name states they’re decentralised (or at least they’re meant to be, that in itself is another whole topic), where a group can be created by friends, colleagues or complete strangers with a shared goal/s in mind where people can enter by simply owning x-amount of the DAO’s token, decisions are made via proposals & voting of the members and these can range from rules, roadmap/plans, managing money in the treasury, ect.\n* Who are the whales (who owns the majority of tokens)?\n* Is the distribution spread out or concentrated?\n  * Similar to BTC, due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of crypto, it’s difficult to map out wallets vs. owners.\n  * Also similar to BTC, there are large institutions that are accumulating ETH as an asset class to add to their balance sheets.\n  * Good to mention that ETH launched with an ICO, meaning that early investors were able to buy a large amount for the price $0.31 per coin, in total around 50 million ETHs were sold at a price raising over $16 million.\n  * Vitalik, being the co-founder is the largest ETH whale, currently holding 290k ETH in his [wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x220866b1a2219f40e72f5c628b65d54268ca3a9d/), however, compared to the circulating supply of 121 million, it’s around 0.24% of the circulating supply.\n  * You can see that the top [100 wallets](https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/ethereum/richlist/) hold around 39% of all circulating supply, which is a lot, again most are exchanges with a large 10% held by the ETH 2 Deposit Contract, where validators have locked up their funds.\n  * Many of the top 100 ETH addresses are exchange & DEFI protocols which include Bitfinex, Okex, FTX, Polkadot Multi-Sig, Arbitrum’s bridge, and Lido.\n\n## All that is great, but it comes down to your own situation which includes:\n\n* Financial stability\n* Short/medium/long term goals\n* Risk appetite\n* Exit strategy\n\nSo, most of the time these questions of “Should I invest/buy XYZ Token?\"The truthful answer is & always will be, it depends…\n\n![Dr. Who](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tJz9zEG0U_WvOqbdyx4bl.png?height=1332&width=1326)\n\nDo your research, live on & hopefully prosper ✌️", "timestamp": 1656083238, "digest": "sLQkSIs3AG31UFLEiXTWSXK3L_XgN-cySL1opK_eVgM", "contributor": "0xd40C1F4242D17023Fa4894812Ee7563124b27C66"}
{"id": "_ynMUHoluU7g8mfqlTd4tAD6QtiISfOxwbiQ3ADfDII", "title": "Using Covered Calls to build runway in a bear market", "body": "### TLDR: DAOs can take advantage of low asset prices to sell covered calls to their community as a win-win way for the DAO to earn up front yield on tokens in USDC, transparently and responsibly convert tokens at scale to USDC, and allow communities to profit from future token appreciation in excess of hodling.\n\nWeb3 and DAO treasuries have taken a substantial hit in recent weeks. Asset prices globally are down and inflation is up. Some DAOs, such as [1Hive](https://twitter.com/Paul_Glavin/status/1537824747714748416), were able to utilize diversification strategies during the peak of last cycle to convert their native tokens to stable coins, to build up that emergency runway, but most did not. It has never been more apparent of how important diversification is. It may seem like there is nothing left to do, because selling tokens at these prices may only further exacerbate the problems and put additional sell pressure on token prices, especially when buyers are becoming more scarce until things settle down. However, I believe there is still one great option to deploy native DAO tokens to earn yield and responsibly convert them to stable coins: long dated covered calls.\n\n**Background**: Hedgey Finance launched the ability for any DAO to deploy a covered calls market (pair of token <> usdc), across any EVM. Covered Calls are derivatives, commonly referred to as Options, where the *Seller* of the call is *Selling (and receiving payment for)* the *Right* (for the *Buyer*) to purchase *X* amount of *Tokens* at a specific *Price per token* before a specific *Date*. Simply what this means is that as the seller, I am getting paid up front in USDC, and locking my native tokens in the DeFi protocol where the buyer can purchase those tokens from me at our agreed upon price anytime before the expiration date. When the buyer buys my tokens, referred to as ‘exercising the call’, they pay me  the agreed upon USDC to purchase the tokens. If the call expires (doesn’t get exercised before the expiration date), then I just get my tokens back and can deploy and sell another covered call.\n\nWhile traders may think of covered calls as a strictly day trading strategy, for the DAO<>community relationship, they can be a very powerful tool that does not require constant trading. Rather than a short term speculative toy, selling 3 - 6 month (or longer) dated covered calls has the power to align benefits and incentives of a DAO and its community.\n\n**Good for the DAO:** DAOs would be selling covered calls to 1) earn some yield in USDC on their native tokens today and 2) responsibly and transparently convert those tokens to USDC at a higher price than current market prices at some point in the future. This strategy does a lot of things:\n\n* Creates immediate stable coin liquidity\n* Transparently and responsibly converts tokens to stable coins as price appreciates - at publicly known price levels\n* When converted, builds a real runway of stable coins, generating true diversification of the treasury\n* Builds trust with the community and investors, while also giving them the opportunity to profit\n\n**Good for the community:** On the flip side are the buyers of the covered calls offered by the DAO - the community (and other investors). While many have seen their portfolios suffer recently, buying long dated covered calls is a way for the community to pay significantly less up front to get significantly more leverage on the token appreciation in the future. As an example, lets suppose we are interested in buying 100 of token X, currently priced at $5. We can purchase those tokens for $500. Alternatively, if DAO_X is selling a covered call of 100 tokens, with a strike of $7.5 and premium of $50 we could purchase that instead at 1/10th of the cost. Without getting into the weeds, if the price of X goes to $10, then we’ll have gained 100% on the Hodl strategy but 200% on the options strategy, and if it goes to $15: 200% on the Hodl strategy but a whopping 1,400% on the options strategy. As prices have dropped so swiftly, this is a great opportunity to purchase at a discount - and buying long dated covered call options will render even more opportunity for gains when the next bull market hits.\n\n**Summary: Hedgey’s peer to peer long dated covered call options are an effective tool to build stablecoin runway in a bear market.** Buyers should have the appetite to take advantage of depressed token prices, and purchasing covered calls gives them an even higher upside profit potential. DAOs can utilize the covered calls to generate some runway up front, and responsibly let the community buy tokens at given price points above current market prices (ie no dumping).\n\n*If you are interested as a DAO or community, but need help in understanding how to price the covered calls reasonably and fairly, please join our [discord](https://discord.gg/2wG5jGsBRw) and reach out to @iceman (or @icemanparachute on telegram).*\n\nDisclaimer: This the articles and materials on this site are not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for, financial advise or legal or tax advice, or investment recommendations.

{"id": "4WT_JfV1dkUgknNvi6FY0zxnqSEhcRKp029eq_G1qvY", "title": "The \"crypto\" in cryptocurrency", "body": "The word “crypto” may spark images in your mind of ciphers, code breaking and even Bletchley park’s involvement in World War 2. I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). From his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. The idea that information wants to find its way into every nook and cranny does have consequences (for the better or worse). For example, information leaks can help us learn about atrocities committed by government, but it can also be used by the government for surveillance of its citizens. \n\nCryptography is a tool that enables us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. It has similarities to the perspective of David vs Goliath as cryptography is one of the only tools that allows a citizen to successfully fend against a nation state actor. In fact, for most of cryptography’s history, it is a tool that allows the defender to protect itself from an all-powerful adversary. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA protocol designed using cryptography tends to have three goals: \n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is not concerned with confidentiality. It is only focused on integrity and authentication. Both goals form the backbone for decentralization as it allows anyone to verify: \n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nPut another way, decentralization relies on a property called public verifiability. This property allows anyone to fetch data from an untrusted source and independently check if the relevant computation (and data) is correct. Applied to cryptocurrency, it allows a network of users to continuously check the blockchain’s integrity and ultimately protect our assets represented in the database. \n\nIf a user cannot get access to the data, or if the cryptography did not exist, then we must blindly trust an authority to protect the system -- essentially how the legacy financial system works today. \n\n## Twitter for your bank account\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\nMany people find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange at first. I suspect this is the case because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use in the dark web. The very name *crypto*currency leads to that misunderstanding. Unfortunately for criminals, they are the most traceable currencies in the world and it is a really bad tool for their desired purpose. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose.\n\nConfidentiality of financial transactions on a global scale is a sought-after feature. A number of systems exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. is a sought-after property and there are a number of systems with strong confidentiality including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. I believe this frontier of research and development is essential for the continued growth of decentralised finance (DeFi).\n\nA fun project is to list the existing DeFI applications and identify which aspects can benefit from financial privacy. But for now, we do not concern ourselves with confidentiality. It is not needed to understand how cryptography is immediately used in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThe cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is basic. There are only two primitives to consider. A commitment scheme to protect the integrity of the blockchain and digital signatures to authenticate actions from an end-user. We have put together dedicated articles for both primitives and in this article we provide a brief explanation of each.\n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature. A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity. They can compute the credentials (public-private key pair) locally on their machine. The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer. A signature is timeless and it can be verified at any point in time.

(Die Teilnahme an der InfoWalk ist nicht verpflichtend aber ich kann’s nur empfehlen, damit du dann bei Treffpunkten nicht so lost bist :p).\n\n**Ab 16:15 Uhr** kannst du langsam an den **Pool** kommen und Platz nehmen für die Info-Veranstaltung. **Die Teilnahme ist** im Gegensatz zur InfoWalk **für alle verpflichtend**, da wir euch sehr wichtige Sachen mitteilen müssen :)\n\n**Im Abschluss** (ggf. nach Absprache etwas später) **geht’s direkt weiter mit deinem Meeting**; da lernst du dein/e TeamerIn und den Rest deines Meeting kennen und werden dir ein paar andere Sachen erklärt.

{"id": "o8k5QLVlZw48PViaIcj1zAExHUF9EK0ZVNAgxWMG3wE", "title": "How did I Save 70000 ETH and Win 6 Millon Bug Bounty", "body": "Hi! I am [pwning.eth](https://twitter.com/PwningEth), a wanderer in the hacking space who has recently jumped into the wonderland of crypto. A few months ago, I reported a critical bug in the Aurora Engine, a layer 2 EVM solution built on the NEAR protocol. At least 70000 ETH were at risk of being stolen, until I found the tricky vulnerability and helped the Aurora team fix it. It would be in the [top 5](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/) heists in the defi history, if the 200 million tokens were taken over by a blackhat hacker. In the end, I won a bug bounty of 6 million, which was the second highest bounty in history.\n\nI am an experienced whitehat hacker from the web2 world. I have been watching the hacking drama in the crypto world for a while, and there is so much randomness! I am not too surprised at the astronomical profits of defi hackers, because the criminals in the real world also make an insane amount of money. However, I was really shocked by the [story](https://www.saurik.com/optimism.html) of saurik, a famous hacker in the jailbreak community. The size of his bug bounty is unheard of in the traditional security world, and so I can’t wait to start my own treasure hunt in web3.\n\nI started by checking the bounty list on Immunefi. The Aurora bounty program, listed on the very top of the website due to its huge bounty offer, caught my eye. It was a novel project built by a group of talented engineers, which suggested that it might be complex enough to be immune to common defi hackers and mysterious enough for me to learn something magical. Thanks to my experiences in hacking modern complex systems, I was able to start my research on the new blockchains quickly. I had reviewed the Aurora bridge, which was a solid project. Then I moved on to the Aurora engine and discovered the unicorn bug in a few hours. Unlike ordinary defi vulnerabilities, I didn't think this bug could be identified by random people as fast or lucky as me, so I took my time verifying and reproducing the bug in case it was a false alarm. It took me a few days to learn, build, learn, test and finally finish the report.\n\nI tried pinging the Aurora team in discord, sending messages to the official bounty email and submitting the issue through Immunefi. They confirmed and patched the vulnerability quickly, and have since recounted the general [story](https://aurora.dev/blog/aurora-mitigates-its-inflation-vulnerability). Their rewards for smart contract critical vulnerabilities are calculated as 10% of potential economic damage of their exploitation, up to a value of $6,000,000 USD. In this case, the potential damage could have been higher than ten times this maximum reward. Therefore I was eligible to receive the maximum possible amount, the total value of $6,000,000 USD, in the form of locked AURORA tokens. It’s a pretty smart and lucky move to be listed on Immunefi :)\n\nThe [technical details](https://medium.com/immunefi/aurora-infinite-spend-bugfix-review-6m-payout-e635d24273d) have been explained by Immunefi. Here is my short summary:\n\n1. The Aurora engine implements token bridging in prebuilt contracts at hardcoded addresses. They are the magical bridges connecting Ethereum, NEAR and Aurora. \n2. The vulnerable contract always emits a fixed address in bridging events, assuming the `msg.value` will be collected by itself. However, if the contract is invoked by `delegatecall()`, the `msg.value` will never be sent to the contract but the log will be emitted as usual.\n   \n3. By repeating the malicious withdrawal then redeposit process, the attacker can double their balance exponentially.

I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). From his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. The idea that information wants to find its way into every nook and cranny does have consequences (for the better or worse). For example, information leaks can help us learn about atrocities committed by government, but it can also be used by the government for surveillance of its citizens. \n\nCryptography is a tool that enables us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. It has similarities to the perspective of David vs Goliath as cryptography is one of the only tools that allows a citizen to successfully fend against a nation state actor. In fact, for most of cryptography’s history, it is a tool that allows the defender to protect itself from an all-powerful adversary. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA protocol designed using cryptography tends to have three goals: \n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is not concerned with confidentiality. It is only focused on integrity and authentication. Both goals form the backbone for decentralization as it allows anyone to verify: \n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nPut another way, decentralization relies on a property called public verifiability. This property allows anyone to fetch data from an untrusted source and independently check if the relevant computation (and data) is correct. Applied to cryptocurrency, it allows a network of users to continuously check the blockchain’s integrity and ultimately protect our assets represented in the database. \n\nIf a user cannot get access to the data, or if the cryptography did not exist, then we must blindly trust an authority to protect the system -- essentially how the legacy financial system works today. \n\n## Twitter for your bank account\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\nNewcomers find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange. Very often, this is because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use on the dark web to buy drugs. The very name, -crypto-currency, can help lead to that misunderstanding. \n\nUnfortunately for criminals, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most traceable currencies in the world. It is a really bad tool for their desired purpose as the historical transactions are replicated across the world and kept forever. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose. \n\nIn fact, even for crime that originates on the network, there are some fun examples to consider:\n\n* **Bitfinex hacker**. The FBI helped recover [over 94k BTC](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency) from the hacker on behalf of Bitfinex. In typical crypto fashion, the hacker was an amateur rapper called [“Razzlekhan”](https://cointelegraph.com/news/comedic-rapper-charged-with-involvement-in-bitfinex-hack-out-on-bail) and a [sophisticated social engineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/agedlikemilk/comments/sskkj6/heather_morgan_giving_a_presentation_on_social/) attacker. They got caught after trying to cash out a small portion of the stolen bitcoins.  \n* **OpenSea insider trading.** A twitter user found credible evidence, using transactions in the blockchain, that a product manager at OpenSea were buying NFTs before they were announced on the homepage (and then sold for a premium). The [SEC will use this evidence](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-117) for proceedings against the ex-employee. \n* **MtGox repeatedly hacked.** The exchange was responsible for loosing around \\~6% of all Bitcoin. An investigation by WizSec, [using blockchain data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l70iRcSxqzo&ab_channel=TheBitcoinArmy), found credible evidence that the exchange was not solvent for a long time. \n\nConfidentiality of financial transactions on a global scale is a sought-after feature. A number of systems exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. is a sought-after property and there are a number of systems with strong confidentiality including ZCash and Aztec Protocol. I believe this frontier of research and development is essential for the continued growth of decentralised finance (DeFi).\n\nA fun project is to list the existing DeFI applications and identify which aspects can benefit from financial privacy. But for now, we do not concern ourselves with confidentiality. It is not needed to understand how cryptography is immediately used in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThe cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is basic. There are only two primitives to consider. A commitment scheme to protect the integrity of the blockchain and digital signatures to authenticate actions from an end-user. We have put together dedicated articles for both primitives and in this article we provide a brief explanation of each.\n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature. A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity. They can compute the credentials (public-private key pair) locally on their machine. The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer. A signature is timeless and it can be verified at any point in time. In fact, we can check all historical transactions in a network like Bitcoin and verify the signer was indeed authorised to spend the coins.\n\nWhat about zero knowledge proofs?", "timestamp": 1656085660, "digest": "a4Y0TrLL7BcS8rarDfDVQW6HJKSTydm5K7u2sEqC2wA", "contributor": "0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5"}

I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). From his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. The idea that information wants to find its way into every nook and cranny does have consequences (for the better or worse). For example, information leaks can help us learn about atrocities committed by government, but it can also be used by the government for surveillance of its citizens. \n\nCryptography is a tool that enables us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. It has similarities to the perspective of David vs Goliath as cryptography is one of the only tools that allows a citizen to successfully fend against a nation state actor. In fact, for most of cryptography’s history, it is a tool that allows the defender to protect itself from an all-powerful adversary. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA protocol designed using cryptography tends to have three goals: \n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is not concerned with confidentiality. It is only focused on integrity and authentication. Both goals form the backbone for decentralization as it allows anyone to verify: \n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nPut another way, decentralization relies on a property called public verifiability. This property allows anyone to fetch data from an untrusted source and independently check if the relevant computation (and data) is correct. Applied to cryptocurrency, it allows a network of users to continuously check the blockchain’s integrity and ultimately protect our assets represented in the database. \n\nIf a user cannot get access to the data, or if the cryptography did not exist, then we must blindly trust an authority to protect the system -- essentially how the legacy financial system works today. \n\n## Twitter for your bank account\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\nNewcomers find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange. Very often, this is because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use on the dark web to buy drugs. The very name, -crypto-currency, can help lead to that misunderstanding. \n\nUnfortunately for criminals, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most traceable currencies in the world. It is a really bad tool for their desired purpose as the historical transactions are replicated across the world and kept forever. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose. \n\nIn fact, even for crime that originates on the network, there are some fun examples to consider:\n\n* **Bitfinex hacker**. The FBI helped recover [over 94k BTC](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency) from the hacker on behalf of Bitfinex. In typical crypto fashion, the hacker was an amateur rapper called [“Razzlekhan”](https://cointelegraph.com/news/comedic-rapper-charged-with-involvement-in-bitfinex-hack-out-on-bail) and a [sophisticated social engineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/agedlikemilk/comments/sskkj6/heather_morgan_giving_a_presentation_on_social/) attacker. They got caught after trying to cash out a small portion of the stolen bitcoins.  \n* **OpenSea insider trading.** A twitter user found credible evidence, using transactions in the blockchain, that a product manager at OpenSea were buying NFTs before they were announced on the homepage (and then sold for a premium). The [SEC will use this evidence](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-117) for proceedings against the ex-employee. \n* **MtGox repeatedly hacked.** The exchange was responsible for loosing around \\~6% of all Bitcoin. An investigation by WizSec, [using blockchain data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l70iRcSxqzo&ab_channel=TheBitcoinArmy), found credible evidence that the exchange was not solvent for a long time. \n\nWhile the lack of confidentiality has helped the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the eyes of regulators and law enforcement, confidentiality is still a sought-after feature to protect the right of users to transact. A number of cryptocurrency networks exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees for transferring assets including ZCash, Aztec Protocol and Monero. The new frontier of research and development is focused on building smart contract platforms that support confidentiality for some aspects of the application.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThe cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is basic and there are only two primitives to consider: \n\n* A commitment scheme to protect the integrity of the blockchain.\n* A digital signature scheme to  authenticate actions from an end-user. \n\nIn the following, we have put together a dedicated article for each primitive alongside a brief explanation. \n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature. A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity.

The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer.

Even inside of the grueling hours of crafting experiences, launching Discord servers (and the games within them), noodling and nitpicking over content and messaging, for the most part, we’re playing with fiction to create transformative experiences. And that’s important -- because that’s what we want everyone who joins the Lost Children universe to do. Play with fiction to create their own transformative experiences.\n\nThis launch represents one of the most exciting periods of my 29-year journey writing the Lost Children of Andromeda story. At first, I thought it was because my dream of bringing this world to life in a new and exciting way was finally coming true.

{"id": "ooAUTCz9e0sh2kW9aBVwsOBZHQTS2b7YTTeLrlGUhMI", "title": "The NFT Liquidity Problem", "body": "NFTs can be hard to sell. Not because you've developed an emotional attachment to your Ether Rock, although I don't blame you — but because there's a finite amount of people who can either (1) afford your rock, or (2) who want to buy your rock.\n\nAnd this challenge extends to the entire NFT market, which, while growing fast, is still small compared to the market for fungible tokens or for traditional equities. This challenge — where we can't buy/sell things when we want — can be reframed as the \"liquidity problem.\"\n\n## What is liquidity?\n\nIn short, it is the degree to which an asset can be quickly purchased or sold at a price reflecting its current value. In other words, a market is liquid if you can sell your asset when you want without taking a material loss.\n\n## How do you improve liquidity?\n\nAs you add more participants (i.e., new money) to a market, liquidity generally improves. This is because the more people you have in the market, the easier it is to enter/exit your position. But adding participants isn't easy when there's limited liquidity. If I can't easily buy/sell an asset whenever I want, I might avoid the NFT market entirely because there's a higher degree of risk relative to other more-liquid investments.\n\nAnd here we find ourselves in a Catch 22. To add participants, you need liquidity, but to add liquidity you need participants. So how do we get ourselves out of this mess? How do we create liquidity without adding more users?\n\nLuckily for us, there are few solutions out there already, and we are going to explore the following:\n\n* **Fractionalization:** Increase asset accessibility (i.e., more people can afford your rock)\n* **Bonding Curve Contracts:** increase asset transferability (i.e., more \"people\" want to buy your rock)\n\n## Fractionalization\n\nIn the beginning of this article I defined the problem in two parts. Fractionalization solves part one, or \"there's a finite amount of people who can afford your rock.\" NFT fractionalization is the act of dividing the ownership of an NFT into smaller fractions.\n\nYou can fractionalize an NFT by locking it in a smart contract (also called a vault) and then auctioning off ERC20 tokens that represent ownership of the locked NFT.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wG7UJIYeXBm83_nRtpzc_.png?height=554&width=1249)\n\n### Fractionalizing our Ether Rock\n\nSo how does it work? If we were using something like fractional.art, we would first initiate an auction on our Rock and sell 10,000 ERC20 tokens (which we can label PEBBLEs). These PEBBLEs represent a claim on our Rock. Together, the PEBBLE holders determine a price they are willing to sell the entire Ether Rock NFT (this is called the reserve price). If a whale comes along and wants to buy the Rock in its entirety, he/she needs to pay the reserve price in ETH. Once paid, the PEBBLE token holders can now redeem their PEBBLEs for the reserve price paid in ETH — completing the \"buyout.\" Now the whale owns the Rock and the PEBBLE holders (who traded in their PEBBLEs) own the ETH.\n\nFor the owner, fractionalizing facilitates efficient price discovery and reduces volatility. But more importantly, it improves the accessibility of NFTs. It provides people priced out of expensive assets, exposure. This means you don't have to wait for the right whale to come along to buy your Ether Rock, instead, you can fractionalize ownership across thousands of people, who have always wanted to be an Ether Rock owner.\n\n## Bonding Curve Contracts\n\nOk, so we made the Rock more accessible, and that's great! But how do we solve part 2? How do we find more people who want to buy our NFTs? Turns out, there is something that can help us, and it's called a bonding curve contract.\n\nBonding curves are smart contracts where you can not only buy a token, but you can sell it back at any point in time. To make this work, a bonding curve does two things:\n\n1. It automatically adjusts the token price based on the quantity of tokens outstanding. In most cases, this means that the more tokens are distributed, the more expensive the remaining tokens will be.\n2. It retains the funds used to purchase the tokens and uses these funds to buy back a seller's tokens.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cJtQXtcV-THGJy24cIfuC.png?height=682&width=1212)\n\n### Bonding our Ether Rock\n\nLet's say a bonding curve contract holds 100 Ether Rocks and it is configured so the price increases 5% (from the initial price) with each NFT sold. If the initial price is set at $10, the first Rock would sell for $10, the 5th Rock would sell for $12, and the 100th Rock would sell for $59.50. If you were to buy the 5th Rock, and 95 others were subsequently purchased, you would then be in a position to sell your Rock at the price of the most recent purchase — which in this case is $59.50 (netting you a $47.59 profit) — and moving the current price down one notch on the curve to $59.\n\nWith a bonding contract, we don't need to auction our Ether Rock on a secondary market when we want to sell. We can just resell it back to the contract at price calculated by the bonding curve.\n\nWith a bonding curve, we now have a way to sell back our Ether Rock. It might not be at the price we originally paid, but it gives us security and at least partial liquidity that isn't guaranteed in the secondary market. Beyond that, it ensures we can price assets in a transparent, predictable, and immutable fashion.\n\n## Tying It All Together\n\nFractionalization and bonding contracts offer new ways to address the liquidity problem without introducing more participants (and new money) into the market.\n\nThey can also be stacked together in interesting ways. Imagine you own an NFT that collects royalties from a song. You could lock this NFT into a bonding contract and mint new ERC20 tokens that represent rights to these royalties. This is, in a way, fractionalizing an NFT to extend ownership across a wider audience. And this isn’t just some thought experiment — founders are starting to explore these concepts to improve how they price and distribute assets to investors. In fact, the founders of [Decent](https://twitter.com/decentxyz?lang=en), a decentralized music label, actually discussed this very thing on the [BlockCrunch podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0q7blbSQ8EJljH8raK6wrg?si=cac71f26e35548b7). And Paul Kolhass, the founder of [Molecule](https://twitter.com/molecule_dao), [considered using this model ](https://tokeneconomy.co/token-bonding-curves-in-practice-3eb904720cb8)to improve the discovery, exchange, and development of intellectual property in the pharmaceutical space.", "timestamp": 1656086563, "digest": "me3fs6F1fiFjix09qCl2ONr3hemopSPtrej401odScA", "contributor": "0xf15c734681f9B950e6559aB5Fe200FCe80539A80"}

{"id": "UQ7IX8cKjbKDTUhHJUijxMbxhcNiT1V2FfvVdhfff6E", "title": "I Can't Train Like I Did Before!", "body": "## TOM’S TIPS NUMBER 2\n\n**Today is time for Tip number 2. I'm sharing a tip every fortnight for as long as I have tips to share ;-) \n **\n\nToday's tip is more of a mindset shift than a tangible nutrition/fitness tip, and it is particularly relevant to those of you stepping into your 40’s and beyond. \n\nIf you are not in those years yet, then great stuff, but thinking about this philosophy ahead of time will serve you well.\n\nIt only occurred to me the other day when in the gym.** \n **\n\nI Can't Train Like I Did Before!\n\nI don’t know about you but the hardest person on myself is..... myself! No one can beat me up as well as I do myself on occasion. I am so good at times that I usually don’t even notice I am doing it. \n\nThe little digs and untruths we tell ourselves here and there, chipping bits of confidence off of us, while we're totally unaware that this process is even going on.\n\nThe good news is that once we do become aware of it, we can take steps to counter it and actually boost ourselves up! But becoming aware of it is the key! \n\n** \n **\n\nOne of the internal chipping aways that is relevant to this article and fitness is I’ll say, “I can't train like I used to before!” \n\nIn my head, this is seen as negative, and I have been saying it a lot over recent years, it seems. Now I get close to fifty years old, the volume of the critical side my internal chimp has been creeping up slowly but surely!\n\nIt was only when I caught my subconscious saying it the other day that I took the time to think about it! Whenever we say something to others or even ourselves, we can become self-fulfilling prophecies. \n\nIt’s like the classic line where you are told to clear your mind and then to absolutely, under no condition, do not think of a pink elephant. \n\nWhat is the first thing you are thinking about? \n\nYep it’s the pink elephant.\n\nWe make statements all day which can inadvertently help or hinder us.\n\nBack to my statement of me not training like I did before. ** \n **\n\nCan I train as heavy as I used to? Nope, I cannot. \n\nCan I train as hard as I used to? Nope, I cannot . \n\nAm I as fast as I used to be? Nope, I am not, and I have had a few injuries along the way for good measure, which really helps my statement.\n\nHowever, is it possible that with work, I could turn this all around? The answer is yes! It’s unlikely, but it is possible! \n\nSo in reality, the statement in each case should not be, “Nope, I cannot”. It should be “I cannot right now, but I could!”\n\nHowever, what does this really matter? \n\nAm I training and using my body? Yes, I am!\n\nAm I using weights which challenge me and am I using enough training volume to get an effect? Yes, I am. \n\nAm I training smarter than I ever did in my twenties and thirties due to a much better understanding of my body and how it operates? Without a doubt, the answer here is a big yes too!\n\nThe key is to make sure we respect and appreciate the body we live in and make the most of its potential, whatever our age!  And to watch our self-talk.\n\nThis is Tom's Tip #2.\n\nI repeat: ** \n **\n\n**Respect and appreciate the body we live in and make the most of its potential, whatever our age! And, watch our self-talk.**\n\nI say this to you now, but remember, as stated a few paragraphs above, our subconscious is always listening (kind of like Alexa) to whatever soundtrack you play it! It’s in our power to change that soundtrack to one that serves us much better!\n\nIf we can exercise, we are privileged to be able to do so. There are many people in this world who are not as fortunate, and would love to be able to exercise their bodies as freely as we are able to, and sometimes this can be the reminder we need to re-commit to respecting our bodies and doing what we can, when we can, to enjoyable move and strengthen it.\n\nSure I had a brain hemorrhage nearly 5 years ago, from the time of writing, and you bet I use this as an excuse to often not do things. (An important point, in some cases this makes sense, and in other cases definitely not, but I can’t let that define who I am now.)\n\nWhen I exercise smartly around three times per week, then I feel all the better for it. When I get up earlier to walk the dog, I feel better for it. You get the picture. Better in myself but also in how I show up for Jess, Olive and those around me.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt said “Comparison is the thief of joy”. Often this is used to relate to others, especially in these days of social media when everyone can seem to have a better house, life, body, car, etc. (fill the gaps) than you, if not careful. \n\nWe need to ‘Stay in our own lane!’ as they say, and focus on us. ** \n **\n\nHowever what happens when you do focus on you too much, in your own lane, and the comparison you are making is with your old self? If we are not careful, the end result can be the joy getting stolen in just the same way as a comparison to others.\n\nNow I know all of what I say is generalised and there are outliers, but also remember what I said earlier where there is always someone supposedly worse off than us, making a better job of their situation. \n\nAdversity in some people really gets them to step up their game, and they achieve more in their seemingly tougher circumstances than many of us do in our normal circumstances.\n\nAnyway what is my point and how can you start to change this and alter any non-serving self-talk? ** \n **\n\n(By the way this is just from my experience, so take it as just that and if you need more specialised help then seek it sooner rather than later. The mind is infinitely complex, so a slight misfire somewhere may be easy to fix by the right person who specialises in that area.)\n\nWell, for me, it starts with being kinder to myself and realising I am just human, and we all have ups and downs.** \n **\n\nNext step for me is tuning into when I am saying stuff to myself or others that does not serve them or me.\n\nAfter that, it is trying to reprogram what I am in the habit of saying to myself (when it is negative) and replacing it with something constructive.\n\nThe next step is to make an effort to get in the habit of saying more positive things than otherwise.\n\nIt all takes time and effort, but it is worth it!!\n\nIn place of me saying \"I can’t train like I did before!\". I now say \"I am very happy, and grateful to be training right now!\"\n\nIn my next 'Tom’s Tips' I will talk a little about something else that is starting to really make a positive uplift in my life and how it could do the same for you or anyone else if you apply it. Once again, it was something that I knew about, and you will too, but I had got out of the habit of doing it. So crucial to moving forward.\n\nAll the best\n\nTom \n\n** \n ** \n \n\n \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1656086419, "digest": "DnOJuBvcToT8MXv9EndrOlIZ6avUbc-QsJlFTwuERQk", "contributor": "0xd63c4496F130DE5006Fb622215D763766C9D48Ca"}

{"id": "L8ktXiNqg8DI8afrG4nhRilqq3dkp9T9Q9oFOQi6vYg", "title": "The \"crypto\" in cryptocurrency", "body": "The word “crypto” may spark images in your mind of ciphers, code breaking and even Bletchley park’s involvement in World War 2. I, alongside others, believe that cryptography is more than just the process of encrypting and decrypting.\n\n![As put by Greg Maxwell, information wants to be free ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cgqgqvvThuR4A3c96HuTj.png?height=1332&width=2550)\n\nGreg Maxwell provides an [intuitive definition](https://youtu.be/Gs9lJTRZCDc?t=2467). From his perspective, the fundamental nature of information is that it wants to be freely available and read by all. The idea that information wants to find its way into every nook and cranny does have consequences (for the better or worse). For example, information leaks can help us learn about atrocities committed by government, but it can also be used by the government for surveillance of its citizens. \n\nCryptography is a tool that enables us to bend the nature of information to our will and prevent its unhindered propagation. It has similarities to the perspective of David vs Goliath as cryptography is one of the only tools that allows a citizen to successfully fend against a nation state actor. In fact, for most of cryptography’s history, it is a tool that allows the defender to protect itself from an all-powerful adversary. \n\n## Goals of cryptography\n\nA protocol designed using cryptography tends to have three goals: \n\n* **Integrity.** Protect the message from tampering while it is in transit.\n* **Authentication.** Authenticate that a message was signed or authorised by another party.\n* **Confidentiality.** Only allow the intended recipient to open and read the content of a message.\n\nRemarkably, the cryptography used in Bitcoin and Ethereum is not concerned with confidentiality. It is only focused on integrity and authentication. Both goals form the backbone for decentralization as it allows anyone to verify: \n\n* They have a copy of the one true blockchain.\n* Signer has authorised the confirmed transaction,\n* Compute the same database as everyone else.\n\nPut another way, decentralization relies on a property called public verifiability. This property allows anyone to fetch data from an untrusted source and independently check if the relevant computation (and data) is correct. Applied to cryptocurrency, it allows a network of users to continuously check the blockchain’s integrity and ultimately protect our assets represented in the database. \n\nIf a user cannot get access to the data, or if the cryptography did not exist, then we must blindly trust an authority to protect the system -- essentially how the legacy financial system works today. \n\n## Twitter for your bank account\n\n![Cryptocurrency is twitter for your bank account](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gS-myq_a57YowwXBU7Ppe.png?height=444&width=904)\n\nNewcomers find the lack of confidentiality in Bitcoin and Ethereum strange. Very often, this is because Bitcoin was touted by the misinformed that it was an anonymous currency and ideal for use on the dark web to buy drugs. The very name, -crypto-currency, can help lead to that misunderstanding. \n\nUnfortunately for criminals, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most traceable currencies in the world. It is a really bad tool for their desired purpose as the historical transactions are replicated across the world and kept forever. This is why it is estimated [only 0.15%](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1479101569899585538) of all cryptocurrency usage is for an illicit purpose. \n\nIn fact, even for crime that originates on the network, there are some fun examples to consider:\n\n* **Bitfinex hacker**. The FBI helped recover [over 94k BTC](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency) from the hacker on behalf of Bitfinex. In typical crypto fashion, the hacker was an amateur rapper called [“Razzlekhan”](https://cointelegraph.com/news/comedic-rapper-charged-with-involvement-in-bitfinex-hack-out-on-bail) and a [sophisticated social engineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/agedlikemilk/comments/sskkj6/heather_morgan_giving_a_presentation_on_social/) attacker. They got caught after trying to cash out a small portion of the stolen bitcoins.  \n* **OpenSea insider trading.** A twitter user found credible evidence, using transactions in the blockchain, that a product manager at OpenSea were buying NFTs before they were announced on the homepage (and then sold for a premium). The [SEC will use this evidence](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-117) for proceedings against the ex-employee. \n* **MtGox repeatedly hacked.** The exchange was responsible for loosing around \\~6% of all Bitcoin. An investigation by WizSec, [using blockchain data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l70iRcSxqzo&ab_channel=TheBitcoinArmy), found credible evidence that the exchange was not solvent for a long time. \n\nWhile the lack of confidentiality has helped the adoption of cryptocurrencies in the eyes of regulators and law enforcement, confidentiality is still a sought-after feature to protect the right of users to transact. A number of cryptocurrency networks exist today with strong confidentiality guarantees for transferring assets including ZCash, Aztec Protocol and Monero. The new frontier of research and development is focused on building smart contract platforms that support confidentiality for some aspects of the application.\n\n## The ‘crypto’ is pretty boring\n\nThere are only two primitives to consider and we have put together a dedicated article for each primitive alongside a brief explanation. \n\n**[Commitment scheme.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/nufhx7EoEPwW9Zoe03rwPapL-AerI4sdDglTK4fN4lM)** A commitment scheme empowers a receiver to independently test whether they have received (or computed) the anticipated data from the sender.\n\nIt is often thought of as a two-step protocol:\n\n* **Commit phase.** Sender can decide on a value and only reveal a commitment to it publicly.\n* **Reveal phase.** Sender can reveal the value and a recipient can test whether it matches their commitment.\n\nBoth the commit and reveal phase can be performed at the same time. A good mental model for a commitment scheme is to think of it was a testing mechanism. Users can check whether they have computed or received data in its entirety. The test is conducted independently.\n\nIn the land of cryptocurrency, it allows all users to agree on the same data and eventually compute a copy of the same database. This is because the node software and test whether they have received the full list of transactions for a block before processing it. Interestingly, a commitment scheme can be used to test whether the resultant database has the expected data and structure too.\n\n**[Digital signature.](https://mirror.xyz/0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5/aIrZPKS0Qs2Ss25JTtaxnfUgLPVOOA1uJ2k6PZZ6XYU)** It is synonymous with a written signature. A recipient of a message can check the message was created by a known sender (authenticity) and the message was not altered in transit (integrity).\n\nFor a cryptocurrency, it allows a user to create and manage their own identity. They can compute the credentials (public-private key pair) locally on their machine. The public key is used as their identity (Bitcoin address, Ethereum account) and the corresponding private key is used to digitally sign messages.\n\nAs such, coins can be sent to a user’s public key and the system can verify the user has authorised to spend the coins if they have signed a message which attests to the transfer. A signature is timeless and it can be verified at any point in time. In fact, we can check all historical transactions in a network like Bitcoin and verify the signer was indeed authorised to spend the coins", "timestamp": 1656086688, "digest": "a4Y0TrLL7BcS8rarDfDVQW6HJKSTydm5K7u2sEqC2wA", "contributor": "0xaFaBa30769374EA0F971300dE79c62Bf94B464d5"}

This guide will cover tools and techniques for researching each, red flags to look for, and general tips on how to go about learning as much as you can about a project. This is a reference guide that will be updated regularly to include new tools and services available, emerging threats in the space, and timely examples.\n\n### Overview\n\n“Do your own research”, or DYOR is perhaps the most common phrase in crypto today. It is used as both advice and as a disclaimer whenever projects are discussed. But for all the influencers and investors that regularly tell people to DYOR, it’s rare that they ever say exactly *how*. Well, that’s exactly what this guide seeks to do. Researching a crypto project will be broken down into three categories:\n\n* The dev team, including their experience and past projects\n* The project itself, including fundamentals and tokenomics\n* The community across all social media platforms\n\nFor each category, I’ll provide research tips, free and paid online tools that can be used, red flags to look out for, and plenty of examples. This is by no means a definitive or all-inclusive guide, which is why I will treat it like a living document, with regular updates and additions as appropriate.\n\n### General Researching Guidelines\n\n* Take nothing at face value - verify all claims made as best you can\n* Use other people’s research as a benchmark for your own, not as a replacement\n* Learn to differentiate facts from opinions.\n* Get facts from known, trusted sources, and gather as many opinions as possible. People believe a wide spectrum of things, and the truth is usually somewhere in the middle of it all.\n* Always do your research *before* investing, not after.\n* Research is a skill. Like any other skill, it takes time to learn and practice to get better.\n\n### Developers and Core Team\n\nResearching a project’s developers and core team is the heart of KYC. All other research aside, if a team has a history of failed or abandoned projects, or they have pulled several exit scams in the past, then for me there is no need to research further. Finding this information can be tricky, though, and it’s only one of many things you should be looking at.\n\nKeep in mind, you are not likely to find everything you are looking for in one place. Especially when researching a team that is not fully doxed, it is more like putting together a puzzle, with pieces scattered all around the internet. Ultimately, your goal is to learn as much about the team’s experience, history, and motivations as you can. So, where do you start?\n\n* Is anyone on the team fully doxed? If so, check them out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/), and google their first and last name in quotes (ex: “Elon Musk”, with the quotes included). Look for any other projects they may have been involved with, and any independent verification of their experience (I can say I was a software engineer at Google on my Linkedin profile, but that doesn’t make it true). Be sure to check the News and Videos sections in Google as well. For developers, look for a Github account associated with their name to see what else they’ve built.\n\n![Always nice when the website includes dev's Linkedin profiles (pic: Landlord Token)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/x5rt7iQsCbwwqKNdnJuF8.JPG?height=590&width=1252)\n\n* Do a reverse image search on profile pictures or avatars used by the team:\n\n\n* [Google Images](https://images.google.com/)\n* [Bing Images](https://www.bing.com/images/feed)\n* [TinEye](https://tineye.com/)\n* [Yandex](https://yandex.com/images/)\n* [PimEyes](https://pimeyes.com/en) - facial search, great for helping to confirm a dox\n* [Baidu](https://image.baidu.com/) - Chinese site primarily focused on China-based content\n\n\n* Usernames can be searched on sites like [NameCheckup](https://namecheckup.com/) and [CheckUserNames](https://checkusernames.com/). These tools will search for the name across hundreds of sites, allowing you to see where else they might be active.\n* If any of the team has a personal Twitter account, [AllMyTweets](https://www.allmytweets.net/) will let you see their most recent (up to 5k) tweets and likes, which may yield some interesting or useful info.\n* If in doubt about anything, ask the team directly! If they respond, you have more information that you can verify. If they ignore you or push back on answering, ask yourself why. If you’re banned/blocked from a channel or server for asking, then you know you hit an important question, and should keep digging.\n\n### Project Foundation, Fundamentals, and Tokenomics\n\nThis research involves looking under the hood of a project to understand what makes it run. The smart contract, website, whitepaper, roadmap, and associated wallets can all hold valuable information about the project.\n\n* Check the contract on [TokenSniffer](https://tokensniffer.com/), [Scamsniper](https://scamsniper.net/) and [Honeypot.is](https://honeypot.is/). All are free, and will scan a smart contract for common malicious functions that might give owners the ability to rug. TokenSniffer will show you other smart contracts that have similar or identical code, so you can see how those projects faired. These services will also simulate sales to ensure the project is not a honeypot. If the project is still in presale, however, they can throw some false positives.\n* Another contract scanning service is [Rugscreen](https://www.rugscreen.com/). It’s more comprehensive than the other two, but costs a few dollars worth of BNB to run.\n* Check the contract and website on [ChainAbuse](https://www.chainabuse.com/) to see if they are connected to any known fraudulent activity.\n* On a block explorer, go to the wallet that created the contract to see where their funds came from, and if they have created any other contracts (be sure to check all chains the wallet is active on). If they have, spend some time looking into those projects as well, at least to see if any were rugged or abandoned.\n\n![This will show you all contracts created by a wallet on a particular chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G2qeV-agUis2qt67rMPtp.png?height=728&width=860)\n\n* Spend time on the website reading everything, and clicking all the links. If there are a lot of spelling or grammatical errors, broken links, non-functioning buttons, or other indications that minimal time has been put into developing the site, that’s a big warning sign. If the contract, roadmap, and whitepaper are not readily accessible on the site (or non-existent), that’s another warning sign. Generally speaking, the less effort that was put into the project as a whole, the bigger the red flag.\n\n![Love to see address, and Whitepaper/Roadmap/Team links all on the website header](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YCfW6uP59_AoF7RRhQiJj.png?height=311&width=1762)\n\n![Scam example: the more you look at these packages, the worse it gets](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_0Ldh-k5X9Y9P2SAZr_rc.JPG?height=911&width=1443)\n\n* Do an [ICANN](https://lookup.icann.org/) lookup on the website to see when it was created. Compare this to when a presale was listed, marketing on social media began, etc. Scam projects tend to be a quick flash in the pan - everything happens all at once, usually, within a week or two. Good projects take time to build.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z_R0s2atHyEinoN5_ty0A.png?height=1110&width=1244)\n\n* Take a look at the roadmap, and decide if the milestones, deliverables, and timetables listed seem reasonable, especially given what you know about the team. Scam and pump & dump projects thrive on hype, and that’s often reflected in outlandish roadmaps. Similarly, carefully consider what the project currently has built and deployed, versus what they are promising will come sometime in the future. If the entire value proposition of a project is built on what they say is coming, not what already exists, that’s a warning sign.\n\n![$50B market cap by next year? That would be the #4 largest crypto, excluding USDC/USDT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T7uapb_UC3sZBY2CGbsIc.JPG?height=321&width=450)\n\n* Give equal, if not more scrutiny to the whitepaper. Is it just repeating what’s on the website, or is it going into more detail? Google their mission statement (in quotes) or other generic-sounding parts of the whitepaper to see if they have been copied from other projects. Make sure the tokenomics and project details covered in the whitepaper match what is presented on the website and socials.\n* Be aware of the tokenomics, especially buy and sell taxes, and how they would impact the break-even point of your investment. For example:\n  * If a project has a 10% buy and sell tax, putting in $1k would get you $900 worth of tokens.\n  * You would need to sell $1111 worth of tokens to end up with $1k back in your wallet after the sell tax is taken out (1111 - (0.1 \\* 1111) = 1000).\n  * This means your initial $900 worth of tokens would have to increase in value to $1111 (a \\~24% increase) just to break even.\n  * A project with 5% buy/sell tax would need \\~11% price increase to break even, and a 15% buy/sell tax would take \\~38% price increase.\n* If the token offers staking, what is the Total Value Locked (TVL) percentage? A low percent may indicate holders are not interested in governance or longevity, and will instead sell when the price rises to their target. Conversely, a high TVL percent can indicate strong community faith in the project.\n* Be sure to verify all claims of contract audits and liquidity locks. If an audit has been done, read the report in full. If liquidity has been locked, find out what percentage of the total liquidity it is, how long it’s locked for, and what the team will do with the liquidity once it unlocks.\n* On a block explorer, check what percentage of tokens the largest wallet holders have. If one wallet owns 10% or more of the total circulating supply, they could cause a significant price drop if they sold all at once. Keep in mind, the block explorer will show the percent of *total* tokens owned, not *circulating* tokens. So, if 50% of the circulating supply has been burned, then the actual percentage owned by each wallet will be double what is shown.\n\n### Community and Social Media\n\nNo project can moon without everyone in the community helping to gas up the rocket. Communities can make or break a project, so you want to make sure you know as much about them as possible.\n\n* Check a project’s Twitter account on [SparkToro](https://sparktoro.com/fake-followers/) and [TwitterAudit](https://www.twitteraudit.com/) to get an idea of how many fake, botted, or inactive followers they have. If the account has used giveaways to gain followers, chances are they will have a lot. Followers gained by giveaways do not mean followers that are invested (or even interested) in the project.\n* Compare the number of followers or subscribers on each of the social media channels. Generally, Twitter and Telegram will be about equal, and Discord will be slightly lower. If there is a large discrepancy between platforms - say, if Telegram has 7k more followers than Twitter - it could indicate they artificially inflated their followers with fake accounts.\n* Do their Telegram and Discord channels have any helper bots set up (Rose, MEE6, WickBot, etc), or is moderating and sending official links completely manual? As with the roadmap, whitepaper, and website, the less effort that is put into a project, the bigger the red flag.\n* Spend some time chatting on each of the platforms. Are there active conversations from a large number of members, or just a regular stream of “wen lambo” memes? What how much engagement do tweets from the official account get? How active are the devs and core team on each of the socials? Are questions about the project answered, mocked, or ignored? Do community members seem genuinely excited about the project and supportive of the core team?\n* Search account handles and project-related hashtags on Twitter, and get an idea of what people are saying about it. Is there a lot of organic chatter from a bunch of different accounts, or are there only a few cheerleaders/influencers driving everything? What’s the overall sentiment when people talk about the project? Look at comments under tweets from the main account, as they are often from holders. Are they supportive of the project and team, or angry?\n\n![Vibe check: ......yikes](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ufy52kE1fFtpqw0WQeWeX.png?height=902&width=737)\n\n### The Takeaway\n\nWith few exceptions, no one source or piece of information will give you the full picture of a project and its team. Instead, you must piece together a mosaic using a wide variety of information, both qualitative and quantitative, and make your assessment from there based on your own risk tolerance. As a general rule of thumb, the amount of time you spend researching a project should be proportional to the amount of money you plan to invest in it.\n\n*Have a question, comment, tip, inside info, or anything else?

{"id": "Q2BGj9NYQT6Gn4m-zs7TOvR9NhEhPQ9rWO0w2OjmNoM", "title": "Importance of Community in Web3", "body": "With the democratization of web3 there is a large emphasis on community and member engagement / interaction. We are seeing this with DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, that give power to the people. The way DAOs give the power to people is having a structure that is community led and has no central authority. In Web2, we saw a lot of companies shoving products on consumers forcing them to accept it at face value until a better offering came around. Web3 is set up in a way where organizations listen to their community to make decisions for the product and the success of the product is shared throughout the community. \n\nThere is lots of speculation around DAOs becoming the dominant form of governance in the future because of the way responsibilities are divided and decisions are made. Undoubtedly, however, they provide a solid framework for the way in which we think about how communities and \"customers\" should be involved in the creation and success of projects aimed at creating real world utility. Here is why community managers, moderators and members of NFT projects that I spoke with think this shift is for the better.  \n\n**Providing a project where individuals feel a sense of purpose** \n\nThere is no better feeling than having your voice heard and members of a community stay to be part of the community, the NFT is just their ticket of admission to that community. As one community member put it “I’ve really always felt nfts, at least rn, are mostly \\[about\\]  access to token-gated communities which people can relate to.” \n\nPeople in these communities relate to others and have their voice heard. Ultimately giving them a broader purpose to be more than just a holder of an NFT. \n\n**Community is the main driver making products successful** \n\nThere are so many great artists whose work never gets the traction it deserves. Meanwhile we see what catches the eye as not very artistic projects making millions but they have strong communities with events planned for members. This is what makes them strong projects.\n\nThis is an issue many face and the great artists who are struggling to build a community now should check this article out for that reason [“your values and culture as a collection and community should be clear to all new members.”](https://mirror.xyz/vataj.eth/r-f22Etw1_AzlqEmRHVPtsLPzW05H2Cph8-pHtM1hPY) This is a quote from vataj.eth, check this piece out, there are some great points here anyone can learn from even the biggest collections. \n\n**There is value in being a member**  \n\nOne community member I talked to told me of their experience of getting involved with a project. The initial goal of getting involved was buying and flipping the art but once the members saw how much regard the owners and moderators of the project had for the community they stayed. \n\nThis is one thing that often is overlooked by people getting into the NFT space. Most see the dollar sign attached and that's what draws them. Individuals initially did not value the benefit of community but once they become part of communities they find a purpose being involved. \n\nCome for the art, stay for the community. \n\n**Anyone from anywhere and any background is welcome** \n\nQuite possibly the best part of having a community in web3 is the ability for any individual to join. The only barrier to entry is internet access and a device that connects to the internet and you are able to be part of a community. Some projects have a price point much too high but there is a community out there for you. \n\n**Takeaway**\n\nNothing is perfect, especially in early stages. We are all learning as we go, but if we continue to learn as communities in web3 and empower one and other to achieve more this space will be able to break down barriers and move humankind forward in such a powerful way. In the end, web3 is bringing people happiness and meaning all through community. I hope community managers, moderators and members each got something valuable out of this article.\n\n \n  \n ", "timestamp": 1656087021, "digest": "pUmj1ocx0s9KxEm-5fYRpsV8zaquQKZ72WajELhcQzg", "contributor": "0x5E73842a3A8946932a78358F4F80fAD96005E4e7"}

This guide will cover tools and techniques for researching each, red flags to look for, and general tips on how to go about learning as much as you can about a project. This is a reference guide that will be updated regularly to include new tools and services available, emerging threats in the space, and timely examples.\n\n### Overview\n\n“Do your own research”, or DYOR is perhaps the most common phrase in crypto today. It is used as both advice and as a disclaimer whenever projects are discussed. But for all the influencers and investors that regularly tell people to DYOR, it’s rare that they ever say exactly *how*. Well, that’s exactly what this guide seeks to do. Researching a crypto project will be broken down into three categories:\n\n* The dev team, including their experience and past projects\n* The project itself, including fundamentals and tokenomics\n* The community across all social media platforms\n\nFor each category, I’ll provide research tips, free and paid online tools that can be used, red flags to look out for, and plenty of examples. This is by no means a definitive or all-inclusive guide, which is why I will treat it like a living document, with regular updates and additions as appropriate.\n\n### General Researching Guidelines\n\n* Take nothing at face value - verify all claims made as best you can\n* Use other people’s research as a benchmark for your own, not as a replacement\n* Learn to differentiate facts from opinions.\n* Get facts from known, trusted sources, and gather as many opinions as possible. People believe a wide spectrum of things, and the truth is usually somewhere in the middle of it all.\n* Always do your research *before* investing, not after.\n* Research is a skill. Like any other skill, it takes time to learn and practice to get better.\n\n### Developers and Core Team\n\nResearching a project’s developers and core team is the heart of KYC. All other research aside, if a team has a history of failed or abandoned projects, or they have pulled several exit scams in the past, then for me there is no need to research further. Finding this information can be tricky, though, and it’s only one of many things you should be looking at.\n\nKeep in mind, you are not likely to find everything you are looking for in one place. Especially when researching a team that is not fully doxed, it is more like putting together a puzzle, with pieces scattered all around the internet. Ultimately, your goal is to learn as much about the team’s experience, history, and motivations as you can. So, where do you start?\n\n* Is anyone on the team fully doxed? If so, check them out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/), and google their first and last name in quotes (ex: “Elon Musk”, with the quotes included). Look for any other projects they may have been involved with, and any independent verification of their experience (I can say I was a software engineer at Google on my Linkedin profile, but that doesn’t make it true). Be sure to check the News and Videos sections in Google as well. For developers, look for a Github account associated with their name to see what else they’ve built.\n\n![Always nice when the website includes dev's Linkedin profiles (pic: Landlord Token)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/x5rt7iQsCbwwqKNdnJuF8.JPG?height=590&width=1252)\n\n* Do a reverse image search on profile pictures or avatars used by the team:\n\n\n* [Google Images](https://images.google.com/)\n* [Bing Images](https://www.bing.com/images/feed)\n* [TinEye](https://tineye.com/)\n* [Yandex](https://yandex.com/images/)\n* [PimEyes](https://pimeyes.com/en) - facial search, great for helping to confirm a dox\n* [Baidu](https://image.baidu.com/) - Chinese site primarily focused on China-based content\n\n\n* Usernames can be searched on sites like [NameCheckup](https://namecheckup.com/) and [CheckUserNames](https://checkusernames.com/). These tools will search for the name across hundreds of sites, allowing you to see where else they might be active.\n* If any of the team has a personal Twitter account, [AllMyTweets](https://www.allmytweets.net/) will let you see their most recent (up to 5k) tweets and likes, which may yield some interesting or useful info.\n* If in doubt about anything, ask the team directly! If they respond, you have more information that you can verify. If they ignore you or push back on answering, ask yourself why. If you’re banned/blocked from a channel or server for asking, then you know you hit an important question, and should keep digging.\n\n### Project Foundation, Fundamentals, and Tokenomics\n\nThis research involves looking under the hood of a project to understand what makes it run. The smart contract, website, whitepaper, roadmap, and associated wallets can all hold valuable information about the project.\n\n* Check the contract on [TokenSniffer](https://tokensniffer.com/), [Scamsniper](https://scamsniper.net/) and [Honeypot.is](https://honeypot.is/). All are free, and will scan a smart contract for common malicious functions that might give owners the ability to rug. TokenSniffer will show you other smart contracts that have similar or identical code, so you can see how those projects faired. These services will also simulate sales to ensure the project is not a honeypot. If the project is still in presale, however, they can throw some false positives.\n* Another contract scanning service is [Rugscreen](https://www.rugscreen.com/). It’s more comprehensive than the other two, but costs a few dollars worth of BNB to run.\n* Check the contract and website on [ChainAbuse](https://www.chainabuse.com/) to see if they are connected to any known fraudulent activity.\n* On a block explorer, go to the wallet that created the contract to see where their funds came from, and if they have created any other contracts (be sure to check all chains the wallet is active on). If they have, spend some time looking into those projects as well, at least to see if any were rugged or abandoned.\n\n![This will show you all contracts created by a wallet on a particular chain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G2qeV-agUis2qt67rMPtp.png?height=728&width=860)\n\n* Spend time on the website reading everything, and clicking all the links. If there are a lot of spelling or grammatical errors, broken links, non-functioning buttons, or other indications that minimal time has been put into developing the site, that’s a big warning sign. If the contract, roadmap, and whitepaper are not readily accessible on the site (or non-existent), that’s another warning sign. Generally speaking, the less effort that was put into the project as a whole, the bigger the red flag.\n\n![Love to see address, and Whitepaper/Roadmap/Team links all on the website header](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YCfW6uP59_AoF7RRhQiJj.png?height=311&width=1762)\n\n![Scam example: the more you look at these packages, the worse it gets](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_0Ldh-k5X9Y9P2SAZr_rc.JPG?height=911&width=1443)\n\n* Do an [ICANN](https://lookup.icann.org/) lookup on the website to see when it was created. Compare this to when a presale was listed, marketing on social media began, etc. Scam projects tend to be a quick flash in the pan - everything happens all at once, usually, within a week or two. Good projects take time to build.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Z_R0s2atHyEinoN5_ty0A.png?height=1110&width=1244)\n\n* Take a look at the roadmap, and decide if the milestones, deliverables, and timetables listed seem reasonable, especially given what you know about the team. Scam and pump & dump projects thrive on hype, and that’s often reflected in outlandish roadmaps. Similarly, carefully consider what the project currently has built and deployed, versus what they are promising will come sometime in the future. If the entire value proposition of a project is built on what they say is coming, not what already exists, that’s a warning sign.\n\n![$50B market cap by next year? That would be the #4 largest crypto, excluding USDC/USDT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T7uapb_UC3sZBY2CGbsIc.JPG?height=321&width=450)\n\n* Give equal, if not more scrutiny to the whitepaper. Is it just repeating what’s on the website, or is it going into more detail? Google their mission statement (in quotes) or other generic-sounding parts of the whitepaper to see if they have been copied from other projects. Make sure the tokenomics and project details covered in the whitepaper match what is presented on the website and socials.\n* Be aware of the tokenomics, especially buy and sell taxes, and how they would impact the break-even point of your investment. For example:\n  * If a project has a 10% buy and sell tax, putting in $1k would get you $900 worth of tokens.\n  * You would need to sell $1111 worth of tokens to end up with $1k back in your wallet after the sell tax is taken out (1111 - (0.1 \\* 1111) = 1000).\n  * This means your initial $900 worth of tokens would have to increase in value to $1111 (a \\~24% increase) just to break even.\n  * A project with 5% buy/sell tax would need \\~11% price increase to break even, and a 15% buy/sell tax would take \\~38% price increase.\n* If the token offers staking, what is the Total Value Locked (TVL) percentage? A low percent may indicate holders are not interested in governance or longevity, and will instead sell when the price rises to their target. Conversely, a high TVL percent can indicate strong community faith in the project.\n* Be sure to verify all claims of contract audits and liquidity locks. If an audit has been done, read the report in full. If liquidity has been locked, find out what percentage of the total liquidity it is, how long it’s locked for, and what the team will do with the liquidity once it unlocks.\n* On a block explorer, check what percentage of tokens the largest wallet holders have. If one wallet owns 10% or more of the total circulating supply, they could cause a significant price drop if they sold all at once. Keep in mind, the block explorer will show the percent of *total* tokens owned, not *circulating* tokens. So, if 50% of the circulating supply has been burned, then the actual percentage owned by each wallet will be double what is shown.\n\n### Community and Social Media\n\nNo project can moon without everyone in the community helping to gas up the rocket. Communities can make or break a project, so you want to make sure you know as much about them as possible.\n\n* Check a project’s Twitter account on [SparkToro](https://sparktoro.com/fake-followers/) and [TwitterAudit](https://www.twitteraudit.com/) to get an idea of how many fake, botted, or inactive followers they have. If the account has used giveaways to gain followers, chances are they will have a lot. Followers gained by giveaways do not mean followers that are invested (or even interested) in the project.\n* Compare the number of followers or subscribers on each of the social media channels. Generally, Twitter and Telegram will be about equal, and Discord will be slightly lower. If there is a large discrepancy between platforms - say, if Telegram has 7k more followers than Twitter - it could indicate they artificially inflated their followers with fake accounts.\n* Do their Telegram and Discord channels have any helper bots set up (Rose, MEE6, WickBot, etc), or is moderating and sending official links completely manual? As with the roadmap, whitepaper, and website, the less effort that is put into a project, the bigger the red flag.\n* Spend some time chatting on each of the platforms. Are there active conversations from a large number of members, or just a regular stream of “wen lambo” memes? What how much engagement do tweets from the official account get? How active are the devs and core team on each of the socials? Are questions about the project answered, mocked, or ignored? Do community members seem genuinely excited about the project and supportive of the core team?\n* Search account handles and project-related hashtags on Twitter, and get an idea of what people are saying about it. Is there a lot of organic chatter from a bunch of different accounts, or are there only a few cheerleaders/influencers driving everything? What’s the overall sentiment when people talk about the project? Look at comments under tweets from the main account, as they are often from holders. Are they supportive of the project and team, or angry?\n\n![Vibe check: ......yikes](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ufy52kE1fFtpqw0WQeWeX.png?height=902&width=737)\n\n### The Takeaway\n\nWith few exceptions, no one source or piece of information will give you the full picture of a project and its team. Instead, you must piece together a mosaic using a wide variety of information, both qualitative and quantitative, and make your assessment from there based on your own risk tolerance. As a general rule of thumb, the amount of time you spend researching a project should be proportional to the amount of money you plan to invest in it.\n\n*Have a question, comment, tip, inside info, or anything else?

And the market value of ETH has converged with the downward trend of BTC.\n\nThe battle of new public chains has already occurred such as ETH sidechain or EVM-compatible form are developed to access ETH. Through quick module calls and friendly development experience, it has taken over the existing ecological users of ETH and has a certain network effect. The differentiation of multi-chain with different cultural preferences,regional groups,institutions and different concepts with new consensus of fundamental principles, etc., are all providing momentum for the continuous innovation and development of multi-chain. Let us refer to the funnel model. The innovation of decentralized finance (replaced by DeFi below) began in the ETH ecosystem. From the initial spark of fire to the market size of $315b, when ETH congested cities can’t carry new residents, the funnel model has flowed to the emerging public chains. At present, the scale of funds in DeFi is $92b. However, the long-term trend of web3 innovation has been created, and the scale of crypto assets and users will still maintain a ten-year growth curve.\n\nLet's start dismantling the major market sizes of Defi\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ofy9-GQosD0uNiBWjSK0W.png?height=720&width=1071)\n\nDex: $24b\n\nLending: $16.5b\n\nBridge: $11.21b\n\nCDP: $9.19b\n\nYield: $6.68b\n\nLiquid Staking: $6.16b\n\nAbout NFTs\n\nSince 2021, the NFT market has begun to boost. Stimulated by stars and wealth effects, now NFT is not only popular in the crypto circle, but also expanded to the world. From the initial cryptopunks to text loot, artwork, community meme, stars and brands, and then to the combination of Defi and NFT, the application-type NFT in the metaverse such as BAYC to the mayc of the derivative monkey, the NFT market is going through the era of wasteland like the cryptocurrency back then. The entire industry value chain of NFT is gradually getting rid of the early speculative trading and a series of product will guide this market into a new phase where value can be captured. If NFT is the next new entry which will lead billions of users into the crypto market, we can also refer to the funnel model to predict the flow of users, NFT>TOKEN>DEFI. We believe that the Defi and NFT will eventually converge, and the current total market value of NFTs is $22.7b.\n\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IP8ZPds8cJj7yfQ79rjRJ.png?height=467&width=1280)\n\nAt present, the mature infrastructure of NFT market include: underlying public chain, Layer2, storage, GameFi, trading platform, wallet, tools, etc. We haven’t seen the builders do the right thing in the integration of NFT and Defi.

{"id": "NvJEwrIRaw4HY_AAX5L63PlXKI9w3mAkenbtvL6AYkQ", "title": "Dtravel Partners with Rent Responsibly\n", "body": "This week, Rent Responsibly [announced its newest 2022 partners](https://au.news.yahoo.com/rent-responsibly-announces-2022-partners-130000608.html), with Dtravel proudly named alongside nine other partners, including Expedia Group, NoiseAware and Breezeway.\n\n[Rent Responsibly](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/) is a community-building and education platform for local short-term rental (STR) alliances. By providing tools and alliance management services, Rent Responsibly equips local leaders to build successful, self-sustaining organizations of STR hosts, managers and all other stakeholders in their communities.\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover why we partnered with Rent Responsibly, how the partnership benefits the Dtravel ecosystem and how you can get involved.\n\n## Aligned Principles Key to Partnership\n\nRent Responsibly’s mission of bringing STR stakeholders together to empower them through knowledge sharing and the formation of local alliances is particularly aligned with our own principles.\n\nAt Dtravel, one of our primary goals is to fundamentally change what it means to be part of an STR community. We’re doing this by increasing ownership and encouraging greater direct involvement in the ecosystem through unrivaled decision-making power and influence for community members.\n\nThere are many aspects of STR hosting, and Dtravel is just one piece of the puzzle. Other considerations such as tax, insurance and property care are something that all hosts must inevitably deal with, and with a variety of conflicting advice strewn throughout the internet, joining STR alliances through Rent Responsibly is an inclusive way for hosts to connect with each other, regardless of whether they’re just getting started or looking to improve their established offering.\n\nIt’s important to recognize that the business of STR hosting is complex and can be daunting due to factors such as various STR regulations and tax legislation. Through partners like Dtravel, Rent Responsibly makes it easy for members to collaborate, solve common challenges, advocate for themselves and steward their communities.\n\nSince Dtravel utilizes web3 technologies that will be relatively new to many hosts, it’s especially important that we continue to educate hosts on how to use our product and the benefits that come with it — and what better way to do it than in the company of other incredible STR businesses working to enhance the hosting experience.\n\n## Benefits of the Partnership\n\nAs part of a select 2022 cohort comprising ten partners, the partnership puts a spotlight on Dtravel, highlighting our unique ecosystem to STR alliances across the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n\nThis opportunity will help generate interest from hosts who are passionate about a sustainable future for the STR industry, with the potential to increase the supply of Dtravel listings as a result.\n\nThe partnership will enable us to leverage the incredible work that Rent Responsibly has done to date by tapping into their rapidly growing database of tens of thousands of owners, hosts and property managers to share educational videos, advertisements and newsletter content with an engaged, high-quality audience.\n\nAlongside the brand and marketing potential associated with the partnership, we’ll also be able to expand our sales channels through speaking spots at quarterly virtual events, participation in biannual demo days and introductions to industry connections.\n\nThere are also a number of upcoming initiatives by the team to further drive traffic to Dtravel by assisting hosts and property managers to conveniently discover helpful STR products and service providers.\n\nFor hosts looking to take advantage of Rent Responsibly’s back catalog of useful content, check out their [Resource Library](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/resources/) for guides, webinars and host learnings that provide valuable insights into a variety of topics.\n\n## Register for the RR Summit for FREE\n\nEarlier this week, Rent Responsibly also unveiled their inaugural RR Summit, a two-day virtual conference taking place 12–13 July 2022 free to all STR owners across the globe.\n\nThe summit will feature 16 educational sessions with 2022 partners, Rent Responsibly staff and expert guest speakers. Topics will range from implementing smart practices to leveling up operations, navigating local laws, scaling sustainably, beating burnout and more.\n\nKeynote sessions will include a fireside chat with HomeAway co-founder Carl Shepherd and a Founders of the Future panel discussion.\n\nWe’ll be speaking on the second day of the summit about web3 being the future of direct bookings, so be sure to tune in then.\n\n[Register for the RR Summit](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/rr-summit-paths-to-professionalization/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=partner_dtravel)\n\n## Join the Community\n\n[Website](https://www.dtravel.com/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DtravelDAO) | [Telegram](https://t.me/dtravelcommunity) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dtravel)\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1656087994, "digest": "ylUfkVpTzYBfqidg8a1d7lQJDK33syHoG1AfUEMYuk0", "contributor": "0xae3565a8b566ebe2a99c6ca30f498c2b0DDF2196"}

I was intrigued by the mysterious tone of communication and the clues that were given. Even though the clues pointed to a possible connection to well-known participants in the cryptosphere, they were not the main reason for my fascination. I wasn't merely fascinated by *Teh Golden One* because Ryoshi might have something to do with it or there might be some connection to SHIB. No, I was fascinated because I could feel the same SPIRIT that fueled many of the experiments in decentralization in this very project. Something in me said \"this is the real deal\" - and I listened.\n\nMany players in the experiment of decentralization have purposefully chosen to remain anonymous and to not draw any attention to their personal identity. Ryoshi even went as far as stating that anyone who would meet him would likely be quite unimpressed. The point was never to glorify the inceptors of these ideas, but to embrace the ideas themselves, run with them, and actually use them to create a brighter world - each participant from a point of individual responsibility.\n\nResponsibility, however, is a curious subject for human beings at this stage of evolution. On one hand, we want the power, the keys to the kingdom, the right to exercise full control. On the other hand, we give all of our power away and project it onto whoever fits the bill in the moment it suits our agenda. Interestingly enough, one of Ryoshi's medium articles referred to this as 'pre-womb entitlement issues'.\n\nHaving difficulty with generating a society which is genuinely based on fully responsible participants, human beings have thus come up with all kinds of distorted implementations of governance. And these distortions have now weaseled their way into how decentralized mechanisms of governance are (mis)perceived.\n\nA common misperception of the principles of decentralization in governance is the following:\n\n> *In a decentralized governance structure, everyone should have identical rights and the idea that some 'special' rights could be earned is utterly against the principle of decentralization.*\n\nThis is the same as pretending that all 300 people on board a 747 are equally qualified to fly the plane, when only two (perhaps a few more among the passengers at most) are qualified to do so.\n\nThe flat out refusal to acknowledge peers in specific positions of functional authority which require qualification or merit and insisting on freely transferrable governance rights is a foolish psychological tendency which appears to be on the rise. And when it comes to decentralized organizations, it can lead to exploitable systems quite easily.\n\nAs ETH founder Vitalik Buterin states in his article \"Soulbound\"(<https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html>):\n\n> \"If the goal is for governance power to be widely distributed, then transferability is counterproductive as concentrated interests are more likely to buy the governance rights up from everyone else.\n>\n> If the goal is for governance power to go to the competent, then transferability is counterproductive because nothing stops the governance rights from being bought up by the determined but incompetent.\"\n\n## Enter Soulbound Governance Rights\n\nSoulbound governance describes certain governance rights only being available to holders of a nontranferrable (soulbound) governance token which cannot be purchased, but must be earned. Within the ecosystem of *Teh Golden DAO*, this token will be VALAR.\n\nWhile all GOLD 1 holders have the power to vote on proposals, VALAR holders will be the only participants in the DAO which can create these proposals on-chain.\n\nThere might be some who (incorrectly, in my opinion) interpret a structure which employs soulbound governance rights as a hierarchical power structure. A structure in which teh people are given an illusion of power while a select group moves all the strings in reality. It may seem contradictory at first, but this is precisely what soulbound governance principles are NOT about.\n\n> Perhaps our society has experienced so much abuse of leadership that everyone has become inherently cynical about governing circles of any kind. I don't blame anyone for that - it is no different for me.\n\nThe only issue is that, we often tend to counter this by abstracting human relationship in the decentralized realm to a point where \"everyone is the same\" and merit becomes irrelevant.\n\nThe very principle of a soulbound architecture, however, is precisely the kind of merit-based involvement and accountability that DO serve a positive outcome for EVERYONE involved.\n\nIt is foolish and naive to presume that all are equal in function, capacity, and intention within a unified structure. Unity does NOT equal sameness. Furthermore, sameness is NOT a prerequisite for harmony and positive outcome for all.\n\nThe implementation of soulbound governance rights is simply based on the acknowledgement of  these principles and the wish to design more suitable systems of governance accordingly.\n\nTo come back to the (perhaps a bit silly) example of the 747, would you want just anyone to be able to acquire the piloting rights? Or would you want the piloting rights to go to an individual that is qualified? When it comes to the governance of commercial aviation, would you want a pilot license to be transferable freely, so that a pilot who earned the license could simply sell it to anyone (regardless of qualification), if the price is right? Most likely not.\n\nMany people seem to confuse unity/equality with sameness, and therefore confuse decentralization with homogenization.\n\nI would make the following case, however:\n\n***DECENTRALIZATION ≠ HOMOGENIZATION***\n\n## A Practical Example of Potential Exploit\n\n#### Why It Could Be Detrimental for GOLD 1 Holders to Submit On-Chain Proposals Which Influence Soulbound Governance Structure\n\nLet's say all GOLD 1 (*Teh Golden One*'s base token) holders can freely submit on-chain proposals for the addition or removal of VALAR holders (VALAR is *The Golden One*'s Soulbound Governance Token). This works well enough, as long as ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE shares the same ethical standard and commitment to the project. But let's presume that one participating party (an individual or a group of participants), who happens to have access to significant resources, has different intentions.\n\nThis party will begin by setting up a whole armada of GOLD 1 holding wallets, as well as many different personas in our communication channels - thus getting everything ready to influence Teh Golden One's governance on a mass scale. This party will appear as a whole bunch of ordinary participants in the DAO, people like you and I. Gradually, they will vote out existing VALAR holders, and vote in more of their own \"virtual participants\". Over a relatively short amount of time, control over the entire DAO could effectively be in the hands of one single party, and the DAO's users - YOU - would be at their mercy. The consequences of this would be devastating.\n\n## A Personal Note on the Community of VALAR Holders\n\nMost, if not all of the individuals who will hold VALAR at the release of the DAO have walked through fire for *Teh Golden One* on more than one occasion. They have shown - in relationship to one another and to the community - that they are genuinely passionate about Teh Golden One's success - for reasons beyond their mere personal gain.\n\nA genuine degree of involvement and interest in the success of a project cannot be simply be measured by holding its base token. It can only be discovered in relationship to the community.\n\nI am truly excited to see what the future holds in store for Teh Golden DAO and look forward to exploring and refining this cutting-edge form of decentralized governance together.", "timestamp": 1656088512, "digest": "6-RWmGzGxvT-azU2w1-TMQXv_ntt73YfAH32dx0vVQg", "contributor": "0x787C58c1841132A2Bb3969e1b77D7A8449fD0c17"}

It may seem contradictory at first, but this is precisely what soulbound governance principles are NOT about.\n\n> Perhaps our society has experienced so much abuse of leadership that everyone has become inherently cynical about governing circles of any kind. I don't blame anyone for that - it is no different for me.\n\nThe only issue is that, we often tend to counter this by abstracting human relationship in the decentralized realm to a point where \"everyone is the same\" and merit becomes irrelevant.\n\nThe very principle of a soulbound architecture, however, is precisely the kind of merit-based involvement and accountability that DO serve a positive outcome for EVERYONE involved.\n\nIt is foolish and naive to presume that all are equal in function, capacity, and intention within a unified structure. Unity does NOT equal sameness. Furthermore, sameness is NOT a prerequisite for harmony and positive outcome for all.\n\nThe implementation of soulbound governance rights is simply based on the acknowledgement of  these principles and the wish to design more suitable systems of governance accordingly.\n\nTo come back to the (perhaps a bit silly) example of the 747, would you want just anyone to be able to acquire the piloting rights? Or would you want the piloting rights to go to an individual that is qualified? When it comes to the governance of commercial aviation, would you want a pilot license to be transferable freely, so that a pilot who earned the license could simply sell it to anyone (regardless of qualification), if the price is right? Most likely not.\n\nMany people seem to confuse unity/equality with sameness, and therefore confuse decentralization with homogenization.\n\nI would make the following case, however:\n\n***DECENTRALIZATION ≠ HOMOGENIZATION***\n\n## A Practical Example of Potential Exploit\n\n#### Why It Could Be Detrimental for GOLD 1 Holders to Submit On-Chain Proposals Which Influence Soulbound Governance Structure\n\nLet's say all GOLD 1 (*Teh Golden One*'s base token) holders can freely submit on-chain proposals for the addition or removal of VALAR holders (VALAR is *The Golden One*'s Soulbound Governance Token). This works well enough, as long as ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE shares the same ethical standard and commitment to the project. But let's presume that one participating party (an individual or a group of participants), who happens to have access to significant resources, has different intentions.\n\nThis party will begin by setting up a whole armada of GOLD 1 holding wallets, as well as many different personas in our communication channels - thus getting everything ready to influence Teh Golden One's governance on a mass scale. This party will appear as a whole bunch of ordinary participants in the DAO, people like you and I. Gradually, they will vote out existing VALAR holders, and vote in more of their own \"virtual participants\". Over a relatively short amount of time, control over the entire DAO could effectively be in the hands of one single party, and the DAO's users - YOU - would be at their mercy. The consequences of this would be devastating.\n\n## A Personal Note on the Community of VALAR Holders\n\nMost, if not all of the individuals who will hold VALAR at the release of the DAO have walked through fire for *Teh Golden One* on more than one occasion. They have shown - in relationship to one another and to the community - that they are genuinely passionate about Teh Golden One's success - for reasons beyond their mere personal gain.\n\nA genuine degree of involvement and interest in the success of a project cannot be simply be measured by holding its base token. It can only be discovered in relationship to the community.\n\nI am truly excited to see what the future holds in store for Teh Golden DAO and look forward to exploring and refining this cutting-edge form of decentralized governance together.", "timestamp": 1656088551, "digest": "6-RWmGzGxvT-azU2w1-TMQXv_ntt73YfAH32dx0vVQg", "contributor": "0x787C58c1841132A2Bb3969e1b77D7A8449fD0c17"}

By providing tools and alliance management services, Rent Responsibly equips local leaders to build successful, self-sustaining organizations of STR hosts, managers and all other stakeholders in their communities.\n\nIn this article, we’ll cover why we partnered with Rent Responsibly, how the partnership benefits the Dtravel ecosystem and how you can get involved.\n\n## Aligned Principles Key to Partnership\n\nRent Responsibly’s mission of bringing STR stakeholders together to empower them through knowledge sharing and the formation of local alliances is particularly aligned with our own principles.\n\nAt Dtravel, one of our primary goals is to fundamentally change what it means to be part of an STR community. We’re doing this by increasing ownership and encouraging greater direct involvement in the ecosystem through unrivaled decision-making power and influence for community members.\n\nThere are many aspects of STR hosting, and Dtravel is just one piece of the puzzle. Other considerations such as tax, insurance and property care are something that all hosts must inevitably deal with, and with a variety of conflicting advice strewn throughout the internet, joining STR alliances through Rent Responsibly is an inclusive way for hosts to connect with each other, regardless of whether they’re just getting started or looking to improve their established offering.\n\nIt’s important to recognize that the business of STR hosting is complex and can be daunting due to factors such as various STR regulations and tax legislation. Through partners like Dtravel, Rent Responsibly makes it easy for members to collaborate, solve common challenges, advocate for themselves and steward their communities.\n\nSince Dtravel utilizes web3 technologies that will be relatively new to many hosts, it’s especially important that we continue to educate hosts on how to use our product and the benefits that come with it — and what better way to do it than in the company of other incredible STR businesses working to enhance the hosting experience.\n\n## Benefits of the Partnership\n\nAs part of a select 2022 cohort comprising ten partners, the partnership puts a spotlight on Dtravel, highlighting our unique ecosystem to STR alliances across the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n\nThis opportunity will help generate interest from hosts who are passionate about a sustainable future for the STR industry, with the potential to increase the supply of Dtravel listings as a result.\n\nThe partnership will enable us to leverage the incredible work that Rent Responsibly has done to date by tapping into their rapidly growing database of tens of thousands of owners, hosts and property managers to share educational videos, advertisements and newsletter content with an engaged, high-quality audience.\n\nAlongside the brand and marketing potential associated with the partnership, we’ll also be able to expand our sales channels through speaking spots at quarterly virtual events, participation in biannual demo days and introductions to industry connections.\n\nThere are also a number of upcoming initiatives by the team to further drive traffic to Dtravel by assisting hosts and property managers to conveniently discover helpful STR products and service providers.\n\nFor hosts looking to take advantage of Rent Responsibly’s back catalog of useful content, check out their [Resource Library](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/resources/) for guides, webinars and host learnings that provide valuable insights into a variety of topics.\n\n## Register for the RR Summit for FREE\n\nEarlier this week, Rent Responsibly also unveiled their inaugural RR Summit, a two-day virtual conference taking place 12–13 July 2022 free to all STR owners across the globe.\n\nThe summit will feature 16 educational sessions with 2022 partners, Rent Responsibly staff and expert guest speakers. Topics will range from implementing smart practices to leveling up operations, navigating local laws, scaling sustainably, beating burnout and more.\n\nKeynote sessions will include a fireside chat with HomeAway co-founder Carl Shepherd and a Founders of the Future panel discussion.\n\nWe’ll be speaking on the second day of the summit about web3 being the future of direct bookings, so be sure to tune in then.\n\n[Register for the RR Summit](https://www.rentresponsibly.org/rr-summit-paths-to-professionalization/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=partner_dtravel)\n\n## Join the Community\n\n[Website](https://www.dtravel.com/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DtravelDAO) | [Telegram](https://t.me/dtravelcommunity) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dtravel)\n\n \n ", "timestamp": 1656088438, "digest": "ylUfkVpTzYBfqidg8a1d7lQJDK33syHoG1AfUEMYuk0", "contributor": "0xae3565a8b566ebe2a99c6ca30f498c2b0DDF2196"}
{"id": "tfCs0IsK-ZhKBjvtz7uHEKDRgQrh4lZqMPq4rO-LiPA", "title": "Thoughts on Soulbound Governance in DAOs", "body": "*(Note: the following article reflects my own personal thoughts and stands in no official association with Teh Golden One. )*\n\nI found out about *Teh Golden One* on the same day the token launched on ETH. I was intrigued by the mysterious tone of communication and the clues that were given. Even though the clues pointed to a possible connection to well-known participants in the cryptosphere, they were not the main reason for my fascination. I wasn't merely fascinated by *Teh Golden One* because Ryoshi might have something to do with it or there might be some connection to SHIB. No, I was fascinated because I could feel the same SPIRIT that fueled many of the experiments in decentralization in this very project. Something in me said \"this is the real deal\" - and I listened.\n\nMany players in the experiment of decentralization have purposefully chosen to remain anonymous and to not draw any attention to their personal identity. Ryoshi even went as far as stating that anyone who would meet him would likely be quite unimpressed. The point was never to glorify the inceptors of these ideas, but to embrace the ideas themselves, run with them, and actually use them to create a brighter world - each participant from a point of individual responsibility.\n\nResponsibility, however, is a curious subject for human beings at this stage of evolution. On one hand, we want the power, the keys to the kingdom, the right to exercise full control. On the other hand, we give all of our power away and project it onto whoever fits the bill in the moment it suits our agenda. Interestingly enough, one of Ryoshi's medium articles referred to this as 'pre-womb entitlement issues'.\n\nHaving difficulty with generating a society which is genuinely based on fully responsible participants, human beings have thus come up with all kinds of distorted implementations of governance. And these distortions have now weaseled their way into how decentralized mechanisms of governance are (mis)perceived.\n\nA common misperception of the principles of decentralization in governance is the following:\n\n*In a decentralized governance structure, everyone should have identical rights and the idea that some 'special' rights could be earned is utterly against the principle of decentralization.*\n\nThis is the same as pretending that all 300 people on board a 747 are equally qualified to fly the plane, when only two (perhaps a few more among the passengers at most) are qualified to do so.\n\nThe flat out refusal to acknowledge peers in specific positions of functional authority which require qualification or merit and insisting on freely transferrable governance rights is a foolish psychological tendency which appears to be on the rise. And when it comes to decentralized organizations, it can lead to exploitable systems quite easily.\n\nAs ETH founder Vitalik Buterin states in his article \"Soulbound\"(<https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html>):\n\n\"If the goal is for governance power to be widely distributed, then transferability is counterproductive as concentrated interests are more likely to buy the governance rights up from everyone else.\n\nIf the goal is for governance power to go to the competent, then transferability is counterproductive because nothing stops the governance rights from being bought up by the determined but incompetent.\"\n\n## Enter Soulbound Governance Rights\n\nSoulbound governance describes certain governance rights only being available to holders of a nontranferrable (soulbound) governance token which cannot be purchased, but must be earned. Within the ecosystem of *Teh Golden DAO*, this token will be VALAR.\n\nWhile all GOLD 1 holders have the power to vote on proposals, VALAR holders will be the only participants in the DAO which can create these proposals on-chain.\n\nThere might be some who (incorrectly, in my opinion) interpret a structure which employs soulbound governance rights as a hierarchical power structure. A structure in which teh people are given an illusion of power while a select group moves all the strings in reality.
